01:46.282 --> 01:47.602
Whoa!

01:48.042 --> 01:48.792
Sorry, dude.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.067
We didn't mean to sneak up on you.

01:51.122 --> 01:54.362
It's just that we can't get to where we want to go.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.402
Oh, where do you want to go?

01:55.442 --> 01:57.282
We're looking for Pike's Trail.

01:57.762 --> 01:59.002
- Pike's Trail?
- Yeah.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.122
This map we got at the dock is no good.

02:01.202 --> 02:03.191
Yeah. Well, north is up.

02:03.217 --> 02:04.707
That might help.

02:04.802 --> 02:07.882
And you might wanna think about staying close to the shoreline here.

02:08.082 --> 02:10.322
There's no cell reception in case you get lost.

02:10.482 --> 02:11.722
Just head up the trail about three clicks,

02:11.842 --> 02:14.042
you'll see a big oak tree, hook left.

02:14.162 --> 02:15.311
About another half click and...

02:15.337 --> 02:16.682
it should be right in front of you.

02:16.722 --> 02:18.442
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

02:18.642 --> 02:22.282
Also, hey, a couple house rules here on Kings Island.

02:22.322 --> 02:26.722
You gotta go by dark, don't leave any trash and... no drinking.

02:28.762 --> 02:30.002
Okay.

02:30.122 --> 02:32.562
So... unload the beer.

02:36.962 --> 02:38.322
Come on, dude.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.322 --> 02:52.042
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

02:52.882 --> 02:55.602
By the way, don't let anyone see that flask.

03:04.242 --> 03:05.682
How's your day going? Okay?

03:05.842 --> 03:08.362
You know, this is the river that leads down to the lake.

03:08.642 --> 03:10.202
We had to put this...

03:13.202 --> 03:14.412
that we have of the island.

03:14.438 --> 03:15.467
It's the biggest one,

03:15.562 --> 03:18.962
but there's also a list of things on here.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.002
Oh, there's no cell service up here.

03:26.082 --> 03:28.482
I'm afraid you'll just have to look at the lake.

04:37.682 --> 04:38.728
Hey, Mister Sanderson.

04:38.754 --> 04:39.467
Are you home?

04:42.362 --> 04:43.762
I actually know that you're around...

04:43.922 --> 04:45.802
'cause I saw the smoke coming outta the chimney.

04:45.922 --> 04:47.042
Are you cooking something?

04:47.122 --> 04:48.737
Are you cooking like a stew?

04:48.763 --> 04:50.147
It smells really good.

04:50.402 --> 04:51.602
It smells like good stew.

04:52.762 --> 04:54.402
You wanna invite me in for some?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.202
- Hey.
- Go away. I'm fine.

04:57.402 --> 04:58.140
I know, I know.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.347
I'm just doing my job.

04:59.442 --> 05:01.442
You're the only other guy who lives on this island.

05:01.522 --> 05:03.402
What would people think of me if I didn't check in on my neighbor?

05:03.482 --> 05:06.362
Exactly what part of "I'm fine" don't you understand?

05:06.442 --> 05:08.202
I...

05:12.082 --> 05:13.242
Thanks for checking in on me, Henry.

05:13.362 --> 05:14.922
Hey, no problem, Mister Sanderson.

05:15.002 --> 05:16.379
Wanna come in for dinner?

05:16.405 --> 05:17.947
Oh, wouldn't wanna impose.

05:18.802 --> 05:19.962
The radius is too big.

05:20.122 --> 05:22.642
Shit, we should've hit these guys before take-off.

05:22.802 --> 05:24.522
Little thing called probable cause.

05:24.682 --> 05:26.562
We didn't have it, fucking Constitution.

05:27.122 --> 05:28.282
We could also use some more men.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.722
Yeah, we could use a lot of things.

05:30.482 --> 05:32.522
We got four thousand miles of border here.

05:32.642 --> 05:34.522
Only problem is we're looking at Canada.

05:34.842 --> 05:36.762
Canadians don't wanna sneak in here.

05:36.882 --> 05:38.322
That's why we don't get squat.

05:38.802 --> 05:40.842
All anyone cares about is Mexicans sneaking in,

05:40.882 --> 05:43.602
and we just happen to be facing the wrong fucking way.

05:43.722 --> 05:44.762
Hang up. Now.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.242
Where are we with the GPS modulator?

05:47.322 --> 05:48.272
Uh, nothing pinpointed yet.

05:48.298 --> 05:49.387
What about border patrol?

05:49.442 --> 05:51.602
Plane was flying too low for them to track it.

05:51.962 --> 05:54.402
There's only one reason a plane flies without a transponder...

05:54.522 --> 05:56.202
and low enough to avoid radar,

05:56.242 --> 05:59.002
and that's because they're carrying a load of some very naughty shit.

05:59.682 --> 06:01.842
We're gonna have to troll the waterways, boys and girls,

06:01.962 --> 06:03.882
and that could take all night.

06:05.922 --> 06:06.842
Open it.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.762
Pardon our intrusion.

06:17.162 --> 06:19.562
We are with the RCMP, patrolling the area.

06:19.682 --> 06:21.362
We heard you needed help...

06:21.842 --> 06:24.442
in locating a suspected drug delivery that went down

06:24.562 --> 06:25.962
couple of hours ago along the border.

06:26.282 --> 06:27.802
We have knowledge of the island...

06:27.922 --> 06:30.682
and would like to offer you our assistance.

06:30.762 --> 06:32.962
You're a bit out of your jurisdiction, aren't you?

06:33.042 --> 06:36.042
And, uh, we don't use horses.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.642
See, we drive cars.

06:38.362 --> 06:42.562
What Mister Johnson meant to say is thanks, but no thanks.

06:42.642 --> 06:45.042
Shitload of red-tape to team up with the Mounties.

06:45.122 --> 06:47.762
Much obliged.
We'll keep you posted.

06:47.882 --> 06:50.882
Pardon me, but we can be really helpful.

06:51.002 --> 06:54.642
We have HMI lights, we have generator, we have trolling gear.

06:54.722 --> 06:56.962
If we don't find the drugs before the runners,

06:57.042 --> 06:58.642
it will be picked up, shipped out,

06:58.802 --> 07:00.402
and chopped down by morning.

07:01.162 --> 07:03.402
Time is of, uh, the essence.

07:05.682 --> 07:09.202
I appreciate your concern, but not interested.

07:09.882 --> 07:12.562
There's no leads that we can share at this time.

07:14.042 --> 07:17.082
Well, giddy up.

07:47.922 --> 07:49.362
Hey, what the fuck, Frenchie?

07:49.522 --> 07:51.442
I told your boys we didn't need any help.

07:51.482 --> 07:53.082
Is this some sort of joke?

07:53.202 --> 07:54.322
Do I look funny to you?

07:55.442 --> 07:58.002
Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, you do.

07:59.122 --> 08:00.962
Is it my shoes?

08:01.362 --> 08:02.762
Uh, kinda.

08:03.122 --> 08:04.682
You see, I don't wear leather.

08:06.642 --> 08:09.151
I'm a vegan. It's for the environment.

08:09.177 --> 08:10.827
I'm helping the planet.

08:19.122 --> 08:20.962
Do you know that cow farts...

08:21.082 --> 08:26.202
...are responsible for one quarter of the methane pollution in the world?

08:59.882 --> 09:01.362
Freeze!

09:02.322 --> 09:03.442
Drop the gun.

09:03.642 --> 09:05.722
- Shoot him!
- I can't get a shot!

09:06.202 --> 09:07.775
We can do this one of two ways.

09:07.801 --> 09:09.627
Hey! I'm the guy with the gun!

09:09.682 --> 09:10.802
And I'm the guy with the guy.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.202
You can turn over the GPS location of the crash,

09:14.842 --> 09:17.002
and I spare you a painful death.

09:17.442 --> 09:19.322
Or we can keep on playing games.

10:34.402 --> 10:35.282
I have it.

10:35.922 --> 10:38.082
Good. How close?

10:38.282 --> 10:40.682
Middle of the lake, few kilometers from shore.

10:41.002 --> 10:43.802
No read on depth, but easily reachable by boat.

10:43.882 --> 10:45.322
- You're sure?
- Yes.

10:45.602 --> 10:47.682
Let's hope it's wrapped tight.

10:47.762 --> 10:49.762
It was not supposed to be under water.

10:49.842 --> 10:52.522
Let's move.
We'll find out about the ranger.

10:52.682 --> 10:54.602
We won't have any unknowns.

10:55.402 --> 10:57.722
Get the horses en route to the dock.

10:59.122 --> 11:01.122
Four hours before replacements show up.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.082
Better get the Humvee, it will be faster.

11:03.722 --> 11:05.802
Think about our carbon footprint.

11:20.362 --> 11:22.202
Think about the children.

11:34.842 --> 11:37.642
Hello? Is anybody here?

11:37.962 --> 11:39.282
Hello?

11:40.642 --> 11:43.082
Down here. Oh!

11:43.482 --> 11:46.402
Thank goodness.
I have been here hours.

11:47.282 --> 11:48.522
I got tired of yelling for help.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.212
Could you come down here, please?

11:50.238 --> 11:51.427
I'm, I'm kind of stuck.

11:51.722 --> 11:53.082
Yeah, hold on.
I'll be right there.

11:56.562 --> 11:57.922
- Hi there.
- Hi.

11:59.642 --> 12:01.602
So you got yourself lodged in here pretty good?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.780
Yeah. It's, uh, it's kinda stupid.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.467
I, um, I saw a blackberry.

12:05.522 --> 12:06.522
Can you believe that?

12:07.362 --> 12:09.922
Twisted my ankle reaching for it and I slipped.

12:10.082 --> 12:11.562
I'm, uh, I'm pinned in here.

12:11.642 --> 12:13.722
All right.
 It doesn't seem so bad.

12:14.082 --> 12:16.042
Hold on, wait.
 Let's just, uh...

12:19.962 --> 12:22.082
How's that?
 How's the leg?

12:22.202 --> 12:24.002
It's, uh, sore.

12:24.122 --> 12:25.362
- Is it?
- Yeah.

12:25.522 --> 12:26.682
Let's get you up on the path, okay?

12:27.122 --> 12:28.842
- Yeah.
- Um, I'll stay here.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.865
Turn around and I'll push.

12:30.891 --> 12:32.107
All right? So you,

12:32.482 --> 12:36.162
you just, uh, I'll stay back here and push you.

12:37.242 --> 12:39.322
Just, actually, let me get up next to you.

12:39.362 --> 12:39.842
Okay.

12:40.002 --> 12:41.962
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

12:42.482 --> 12:44.922
- Okay. Just hold on to me.
- Okay.

12:49.042 --> 12:51.762
- Can you put any weight on it?
- Some.

12:51.922 --> 12:53.122
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:54.322 --> 12:56.562
Here. I'm just gonna carry you, okay?

12:57.682 --> 12:59.722
I'm gonna lose my feminist card for this.

12:59.842 --> 13:01.282
Well, I won't tell anyone if you don't.

13:04.362 --> 13:05.962
Hey, guys, you know the cell tower is down and...

13:06.002 --> 13:07.442
Holy shit!

13:12.562 --> 13:13.722
No cell, radio's busted.

13:13.842 --> 13:16.082
There's a GPS signal coming from the water near Kings Island.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.182
That's where they're headed.

13:17.208 --> 13:18.227
They're going to the dock!

13:21.682 --> 13:23.002
It doesn't look too bad.

13:23.162 --> 13:24.882
We'll just keep it elevated.

13:24.922 --> 13:25.863
I could tie it a little tighter.

13:25.889 --> 13:26.947
That would keep the swelling down.

13:27.082 --> 13:28.802
- Okay.
- Okay. You ready?

13:28.882 --> 13:31.322
I'll pull on three.

13:31.922 --> 13:34.722
One, two, three.

13:35.522 --> 13:36.642
You tricked me.

13:39.442 --> 13:42.162
So, are you a military guy?

13:42.282 --> 13:44.402
Yeah. How'd you know?

13:44.722 --> 13:45.962
You got the look.

13:46.522 --> 13:49.242
Also, you know, the photographs over there.

13:49.842 --> 13:51.322
Uh, yeah, I was a diver.

13:51.442 --> 13:52.922
Uh, they used to call us frogmen.

13:53.042 --> 13:55.202
Wow, that sounds exciting.

13:55.282 --> 13:57.802
Uh, well, I mean, I guess it depends on the level of danger.

13:58.562 --> 14:01.362
Right. I mean, I didn't mean it sounded fun.

14:01.442 --> 14:05.162
Just, you know, it's not your normal nine-to five.

14:05.562 --> 14:10.682
So, you never get lonely being out here, all by yourself?

14:11.522 --> 14:13.882
Couple hundred people come through here every weekend.

14:13.962 --> 14:16.802
Yeah, but there's being around people,

14:16.882 --> 14:18.802
and then there's being with people.

14:20.762 --> 14:22.442
Could I be sounding more of a bitch?
I'm sorry.

14:22.522 --> 14:23.409
No, no, no. I understand.

14:23.435 --> 14:24.402
It must look pretty weird.

14:24.442 --> 14:28.722
I just, uh, I just needed to be by myself, so...

14:29.562 --> 14:32.082
Had to clear my head of some stuff.

14:32.242 --> 14:34.922
Right, so how long you been here?

14:35.162 --> 14:37.522
- Three years.
- Three years?

14:37.882 --> 14:40.602
Well, it must be pretty clear by now.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.422
Clear. It's getting better.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.707
Still a bit murky.

14:44.402 --> 14:48.842
Well, clear or murky, it's a, it's a nice head.

14:49.682 --> 14:51.242
Aw, thanks, ma'am.

14:53.362 --> 14:55.402
Hey, um, how's the ankle feeling?

14:55.682 --> 14:56.442
Better.

14:56.602 --> 14:58.842
Good, 'cause it's gonna get dark soon.

14:58.962 --> 15:00.082
We don't wanna lose the light on the water.

15:00.162 --> 15:01.882
Probably could get you down to your canoe.

15:02.042 --> 15:02.802
- Okay.
- Ready?

15:02.882 --> 15:04.722
- Yeah.
- Hey, you... know,

15:04.762 --> 15:07.082
...it would be no problem to quickly shuttle you across the water.

15:07.562 --> 15:09.762
That's kind, but I'll be fine.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.882
Besides, I don't want to leave my canoe here.

15:12.002 --> 15:13.202
Okay.

15:13.362 --> 15:15.282
We should exchange info, though.

15:15.362 --> 15:17.202
So you know I made it back safely.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.122
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's great.

15:19.202 --> 15:20.722
Okay.

15:21.682 --> 15:24.011
I, uh, I stole a map from your office.

15:24.037 --> 15:25.507
I hope you don't mind.

15:25.562 --> 15:28.082
Those things are worth like, thousands, you know.

15:28.842 --> 15:32.682
Well, use this hundred dollars worth to write down your number.

15:33.442 --> 15:34.682
And I can call you before dinner.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.762
Dinner?

15:38.322 --> 15:40.082
Yeah. Dinner.

15:40.242 --> 15:44.602
You know, eating a meal at night together.

15:44.722 --> 15:47.322
Speaking in between bites to get to know someone.

15:50.122 --> 15:53.522
Uh-huh. Um, next week sometime?

15:53.762 --> 15:54.842
I was thinking more like tonight.

15:56.842 --> 15:58.562
My address is on the back.

15:58.642 --> 16:00.642
I'll expect you around nine?

16:00.762 --> 16:02.402
We could eat a picnic under the stars?

16:03.762 --> 16:05.236
You saved me today.

16:05.262 --> 16:07.667
Let me say thank you. Please.

16:08.762 --> 16:09.722
I don't know.

16:09.882 --> 16:11.882
I've got a lot of stuff to do up at the lodge.

16:11.962 --> 16:12.876
Yeah, I noticed.

16:12.902 --> 16:14.787
It's a, a real hub of activity.

16:15.282 --> 16:18.442
Come on. I'm so grateful to you.

16:19.362 --> 16:21.200
It's dinner, for God's sake.

16:21.226 --> 16:22.867
I will see you tonight.

16:26.242 --> 16:28.122
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.

16:39.722 --> 16:41.242
Eeny...

16:41.762 --> 16:44.482
meeny, miny...

16:50.962 --> 16:52.162
moe.

16:52.562 --> 16:54.122
Get the equipment.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.162
We're leaving in five.

16:57.562 --> 16:59.962
He shoots, he scores!

17:33.362 --> 17:34.642
Coming.

17:41.202 --> 17:41.932
Oh, thank God!

17:41.958 --> 17:44.147
I was starting to think nobody was home.

17:44.322 --> 17:46.762
I'm here. What are you doing on the island so late?

17:46.842 --> 17:50.402
Oh, I, I beached my boat like, way on the other side of the island.

17:50.522 --> 17:52.322
I just started hiking, and I got lost.

17:52.402 --> 17:54.042
Sun went down, I couldn't find my way back to the trail.

17:54.162 --> 17:56.042
Yours was the only light I saw for miles.

17:56.282 --> 17:57.175
Glad you found me.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.787
Come on in. Get you warmed up.

17:59.322 --> 18:01.162
- Sorry about the mess.
- Right.

18:01.482 --> 18:02.802
Can I get you anything?

18:02.922 --> 18:03.644
A water'd be great.

18:03.670 --> 18:05.227
All right, come on right back here.

18:06.242 --> 18:08.082
Not a lot of residents around here, I take it?

18:08.242 --> 18:09.323
No, it's just me.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.747
There's another guy,

18:10.802 --> 18:14.362
had his cabin grand-fathered in before they declared this a state park.

18:16.082 --> 18:18.202
I feel like an idiot getting lost like I did.

18:18.322 --> 18:22.082
Don't be.
Kings Island, it's not easy to navigate.

18:22.162 --> 18:25.842
It's why we got all the signs saying leave before the sun hits the horizon.

18:29.522 --> 18:32.322
- Thanks for that.
- Sure.

18:34.962 --> 18:37.202
So what are we gonna do with you, Mister...?

18:37.242 --> 18:40.042
Clay. Everybody call me Clay.

18:40.522 --> 18:42.482
I guess you're gonna have to spend the night,

18:42.642 --> 18:44.042
if you don't mind sleeping on the floor.

18:44.162 --> 18:45.722
I've got extra blankets and a pillow.

18:46.322 --> 18:48.682
And in the morning, we'll look for your boat.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.802
Cool.

18:50.882 --> 18:54.922
So you work up near here or down in the city?

18:55.882 --> 18:57.482
Not working at all right now.

18:57.842 --> 18:59.882
Was a construction worker but that turns into day...

18:59.962 --> 19:01.802
laborer pretty quick when people stop building.

19:01.842 --> 19:03.562
Yeah, I hear that.

19:03.762 --> 19:06.282
Though the economy seems to bring people to the outdoors.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.402
We've been pretty busy up here.

19:07.442 --> 19:08.842
Silver lining, so to speak?

19:09.602 --> 19:11.482
So is that what this job is all about?

19:12.362 --> 19:14.162
Getting in touch with nature?

19:14.602 --> 19:15.922
So to speak.

19:16.002 --> 19:18.642
I guess you could say I came up here for a little bit of perspective,

19:19.082 --> 19:21.362
but it's hard to explain.

19:21.522 --> 19:23.642
Well, I'll get the blankets and the pillow.

19:23.722 --> 19:26.722
I'm actually going out tonight and I won't be back until late.

19:27.002 --> 19:29.362
Going out? This late at night?

19:34.122 --> 19:36.042
Looks like you brought a knife to a gun fight.

19:53.402 --> 19:55.362
I've gotta give it to you, Henry, you're kinda perceptive.

19:57.242 --> 19:59.122
Must be that, what you call, military training.

20:00.002 --> 20:04.202
Duck and cover, enemy approaching. Sit.

20:05.042 --> 20:06.682
If you want money, I don't have any.

20:06.802 --> 20:09.562
If that was what I was after, you think I'd come to a place like this?

20:10.162 --> 20:12.122
It's a fucking gold mine, right?

20:12.842 --> 20:14.042
What do you want?

20:14.242 --> 20:17.042
It's not about what I want, it's about what's right.

20:17.682 --> 20:19.242
It's about what's just.

20:19.682 --> 20:23.922
Whatever you think I did, I can assure you I didn't do it.

20:24.082 --> 20:25.922
See, that's where you're wrong, Henry.

20:26.482 --> 20:29.162
You can't assure nobody of nothing.

20:30.042 --> 20:32.220
I will always place the mission first.

20:32.246 --> 20:33.907
I will never accept defeat.

20:34.002 --> 20:37.682
I will never leave a fallen comrade behind.

20:38.522 --> 20:39.842
That sound familiar?

20:41.642 --> 20:45.242
I'm telling you this so you'll understand.

20:48.162 --> 20:51.002
I always knew I was gonna be a fuck-up like my old man.

20:51.882 --> 20:53.682
And I did not disappoint.

20:54.562 --> 20:58.762
No, sir. So I had to make sure my baby brother was the opposite.

20:59.722 --> 21:02.242
In school, he get a "B" I'd belt him one,

21:02.482 --> 21:04.522
make sure he raised it to an "A."

21:06.322 --> 21:07.882
He was everything I wasn't.

21:08.922 --> 21:11.842
He was a fucking all-star at everything.

21:12.442 --> 21:15.082
He enlisted so he could go to college.

21:15.922 --> 21:17.722
And I told him, if you're gonna be a soldier,

21:17.802 --> 21:20.682
you're gonna be the best soldier.

21:20.842 --> 21:22.122
I pushed him...

21:22.682 --> 21:24.522
the way I wish somebody had pushed me.

21:25.402 --> 21:29.282
When he made Special Forces, it was the proudest day in my life.

21:31.442 --> 21:35.082
Few months later, I got locked up for this bullshit assault charge.

21:37.042 --> 21:38.402
That's where I got the letter...

21:39.562 --> 21:41.642
telling me Decker'd been killed...

21:41.802 --> 21:44.362
- in a firefight in Afghanistan.
- Decker!

21:44.682 --> 21:46.246
You're Decker's brother.

21:46.272 --> 21:48.227
I said shut the fuck up!

21:50.322 --> 21:52.282
Now that's a hard pill to swallow,

21:54.002 --> 21:56.162
finding out your baby brother's been killed.

21:57.722 --> 21:59.242
But what made it even harder...

22:00.002 --> 22:02.202
was learning he had been abandoned

22:02.802 --> 22:07.882
by his commanding officer and left to die at enemy hands.

22:08.722 --> 22:10.522
They sent us in, without knowing the risks.

22:10.602 --> 22:11.874
It wasn't my fault.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.707
It wasn't anyone's fault.

22:13.842 --> 22:15.282
So why did you resign?

22:15.402 --> 22:17.362
The military acted on bad Intel.

22:17.802 --> 22:19.902
They gave the order, it went crazy.

22:19.928 --> 22:21.067
I don't know I...

22:21.802 --> 22:23.042
I guess I just couldn't take it any more.

22:23.162 --> 22:24.922
That is fucking bullshit!

22:25.842 --> 22:29.722
Admit it.
Admit you got my brother killed.

22:29.802 --> 22:31.602
Confess it right now,

22:31.882 --> 22:34.282
and I will make sure your death is quick.

22:35.682 --> 22:37.642
But you keep lying to me,

22:38.522 --> 22:42.202
and I promise you, it will be anything but.

22:42.482 --> 22:44.522
They ordered us into a shitstorm,

22:44.642 --> 22:46.042
your brother got separated,

22:46.242 --> 22:47.882
and if we'd have gone in there, we'd have all been shredded.

22:47.962 --> 22:50.762
I had to protect my team.

22:50.882 --> 22:54.042
You had to protect yourself!

22:54.482 --> 22:56.562
You're a fucking coward.

22:56.962 --> 22:59.522
You should've been leading the charge, Henry,

22:59.922 --> 23:01.602
not falling behind it.

23:04.322 --> 23:06.922
Hey, Henry, it's Kayla.

23:07.122 --> 23:09.962
Um, I just wanted to tell you that I'm running a few minutes late,

23:10.042 --> 23:11.322
but I...

23:15.762 --> 23:17.322
You don't have to do this.

23:17.762 --> 23:19.482
We can work this out.

23:19.642 --> 23:22.602
No, we can't.

24:39.002 --> 24:44.162
Oh, you guys.
Now that is good, pure, crisp air.

24:45.922 --> 24:48.762
Eto, are you ready to dive?

24:49.042 --> 24:50.402
Just about.

24:50.802 --> 24:52.562
- Francois.
- We're getting close.

24:52.642 --> 24:53.682
And how are we for time?

24:53.842 --> 24:56.882
The next shift arrives in three hours, twenty minutes.

24:57.402 --> 24:58.482
We are clear till then.

24:59.042 --> 25:00.522
I want to be gone in two.

25:01.162 --> 25:03.842
We have to retrieve fifty pounds of pure,

25:03.922 --> 25:07.842
white, uncut heroin, and pound for pound,

25:08.082 --> 25:10.482
it's worth more than each of you.

25:11.002 --> 25:14.722
So make yourselves worth a lot.

25:19.482 --> 25:22.282
You awake? Huh?

25:24.682 --> 25:25.922
You awake?

25:27.362 --> 25:30.082
Get up. I'm tired of carrying your ass.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.402
I said get up!

25:38.402 --> 25:40.122
You had me there for a second, didn't you?

25:41.042 --> 25:42.962
Good thing I over-prepared.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.042
Nothing could have stopped this day.

25:46.162 --> 25:47.442
You hear me?

25:48.242 --> 25:50.282
You won't feel better when it's over.

25:50.642 --> 25:53.002
I might. Stop.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.362
Take this.

25:58.002 --> 25:58.922
What are you doing?

25:59.042 --> 26:00.682
It's got a bullet in the chamber.

26:01.442 --> 26:04.562
You put it to your head, you pull the trigger.

26:05.282 --> 26:06.602
Do the honorable thing.

26:07.602 --> 26:09.242
Did you learn about honor in prison?

26:09.362 --> 26:10.855
Maybe I did.

26:10.881 --> 26:12.747
I did my time.

26:13.882 --> 26:15.762
Now it's time for you to pay for your sins.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.242
Go ahead.

26:18.802 --> 26:20.882
Put it to your head and pull the trigger,

26:21.042 --> 26:22.762
'cause if you're not man enough to do it,

26:22.962 --> 26:25.722
I promise you, I will.

26:26.122 --> 26:28.642
You know, for a long time I wanted to do this.

26:31.322 --> 26:32.722
Every goddamn day.

26:33.402 --> 26:35.922
You think I didn't blame myself?
Do you?

26:37.682 --> 26:39.442
I couldn't send any more men in.

26:40.922 --> 26:42.522
He wouldn't have let that happen,

26:43.122 --> 26:44.522
no soldier would,

26:45.442 --> 26:46.762
And he was a soldier.

26:47.842 --> 26:49.642
I still think I could have done more,

26:50.602 --> 26:52.682
except I don't know what the more is.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.362
I lost my career, I drank.

26:55.762 --> 26:57.322
I have a son.

26:59.122 --> 27:01.002
I haven't seen him since my wife threw me out.

27:02.322 --> 27:05.242
So I got as far away from everything as I could and here I am.

27:06.202 --> 27:09.522
After a while, I stopped feeling like I killed him.

27:11.122 --> 27:12.642
A little bit at a time.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.402
So I guess you're just too late.

27:15.922 --> 27:20.082
A while ago I would have done it gladly.

27:20.482 --> 27:24.282
Now, you're just gonna have to do it yourself.

27:25.122 --> 27:26.482
Sorry.

27:28.922 --> 27:30.282
Very well then.

27:35.602 --> 27:36.602
Don't you say a word.

27:36.682 --> 27:39.442
This is Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

27:39.482 --> 27:41.682
That's not ICE.
They don't patrol at night.

27:41.802 --> 27:43.722
- At least not without contacting me.
- You there.

27:44.402 --> 27:45.559
Let me see your hands.

27:45.585 --> 27:47.267
Sure, my bad. We just, uh,

27:47.322 --> 27:49.162
out here night fishing. Trout.

27:49.242 --> 27:51.122
You need to leave the beach. Now.

27:51.322 --> 27:53.802
No problem. We ain't caught nothing all night anyway.

27:55.042 --> 27:56.096
Who's there with you?

27:56.122 --> 27:57.427
I'm the park ranger.

27:57.882 --> 27:59.282
What's going on here?

27:59.762 --> 28:01.802
Just caught him night fishing like he said.

28:02.802 --> 28:04.482
Looks like he caught you.

28:04.882 --> 28:07.202
Gentlemen, mind stepping forward?

28:11.922 --> 28:12.762
Get down!

28:36.362 --> 28:37.842
Was that gunfire?

28:38.482 --> 28:40.122
Well, it ain't the fourth of July.

28:48.562 --> 28:49.362
Eto's down.

29:01.202 --> 29:02.122
Shit.

29:16.442 --> 29:17.562
Fuck.

29:43.322 --> 29:44.522
No.

29:59.402 --> 30:01.322

30:19.562 --> 30:20.722
Eto.

30:25.202 --> 30:28.042
Close your eyes.

30:54.322 --> 30:55.602
What the hell was that?

30:56.242 --> 30:59.242
Who was that guy with the shotgun, and why was the ranger there?

30:59.522 --> 31:01.362
I thought he was accounted for.

31:02.002 --> 31:04.842
I don't know.
We had tabs on him.

31:04.962 --> 31:06.802
How do you not know?

31:10.482 --> 31:14.522
Oh. You don't know how close you came.

31:27.922 --> 31:30.402
So, let's get to the landing strip.

31:30.562 --> 31:32.842
We don't know if anyone heard those shots.

31:32.922 --> 31:34.922
No one lives here except the ranger.

31:35.042 --> 31:36.882
We can work with this.

31:37.322 --> 31:39.242
We complete the mission with the ranger.

31:39.402 --> 31:41.202
He has training, he can make the dive.

31:41.842 --> 31:43.097
We hunt the ranger.

31:43.123 --> 31:44.682
We kill the other guy.

31:44.722 --> 31:48.002
No mistake. No hesitation.

31:50.162 --> 31:51.162
Let's go.

32:06.122 --> 32:08.115
Signs of struggle.

32:08.141 --> 32:10.907
The phone is shattered.

32:11.322 --> 32:13.082
That must be our new friend.

32:13.562 --> 32:15.522
Sink all the canoes.

32:15.602 --> 32:19.282
No one gets off of this place except us.

32:19.602 --> 32:21.842
There is a boat tied up outside.

32:22.522 --> 32:24.042
The engine's still warm.

32:24.362 --> 32:25.522
Sink it.

32:45.522 --> 32:46.642
Oi!

32:49.362 --> 32:51.042
No one asked you to leave!

32:52.482 --> 32:54.042
Put the kayak down.

33:02.602 --> 33:03.642
Now start walking.

33:03.842 --> 33:06.602
Whatever you guys are up to, go ahead and do it.

33:06.682 --> 33:07.922
Just don't litter my park.

33:08.042 --> 33:11.122
Oh, park ranger humor? Very funny.

33:11.282 --> 33:12.322
Where is the other guy?

33:12.402 --> 33:14.202
I don't know and I don't wanna know.

33:14.322 --> 33:16.202
You know, he led me down here at gunpoint.

33:16.282 --> 33:17.322
He wanted to kill me.

33:17.442 --> 33:19.642
Well then, you won't be sorry when we kill him.

33:53.602 --> 33:54.722
Oops.

33:57.442 --> 33:59.322
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:00.402 --> 34:02.682
I don't want you dead, okay?
They do.

34:03.602 --> 34:06.002
In the next few hours, we're gonna have to work together...

34:06.042 --> 34:07.442
if we wanna survive.

34:08.042 --> 34:09.522
Work together?

34:09.641 --> 34:11.442
Have you lost your goddamned mind?

34:11.562 --> 34:15.402
Listen, in the service, they paired us up with Pakistani "special forces".

34:15.562 --> 34:18.562
These incompetent assholes who wanted us dead.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.962
And we didn't like them either, but we worked together...

34:21.242 --> 34:22.522
knowing that at some point,

34:22.922 --> 34:24.202
either later that same day...

34:24.282 --> 34:26.081
or twenty years from now when the politics changed,

34:26.161 --> 34:28.121
we'd be trying to kill each other again.

34:28.922 --> 34:30.322
You understand what I'm saying?

34:31.922 --> 34:33.002
Let's go.

34:37.681 --> 34:41.282
Jean? Jean, report.

34:43.562 --> 34:45.802
Saul, we've lost Jean.

34:46.322 --> 34:48.322
Be prepared for heavy resistance.

34:48.922 --> 34:50.208
Understood. When we were...

34:50.235 --> 34:52.092
in the visitors center, I took a map.

34:53.042 --> 34:54.762
I'm looking at it now,

34:55.282 --> 34:58.482
and it shows another cabin...
further inland.

34:58.602 --> 35:01.282
Take care of it. I'm on my way.

35:02.122 --> 35:04.842
So, who the fuck are they?

35:05.442 --> 35:08.362
Military trained.
French Canadian by the sound of it.

35:08.882 --> 35:11.242
Probably mercenaries, either working the drug routes...

35:11.762 --> 35:13.642
or picking off the leftovers.

35:14.002 --> 35:15.602
A lot of drama for some weed.

35:15.762 --> 35:16.762
They got too much firepower.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.602
It's gotta be something more lucrative.

35:19.122 --> 35:20.447
Okay, makes sense.

35:20.473 --> 35:22.387
So what's our next move?

35:22.482 --> 35:23.602
We gotta call for help.

35:23.682 --> 35:25.162
You destroyed my phone,

35:25.602 --> 35:27.242
so we need another one and there's an old man...

35:27.482 --> 35:29.042
lives a few miles up this way.

35:29.162 --> 35:30.242
That's where we're headed.

35:30.322 --> 35:31.802
Hey. Stop.

35:35.322 --> 35:36.362
You sure he's got a phone?

35:36.482 --> 35:37.314
I don't know.

35:37.340 --> 35:39.067
But he's our only option.

35:48.722 --> 35:50.642
No visual... on the park ranger,

35:51.362 --> 35:53.362
but, uh, there's a body on the ground.

35:53.762 --> 35:55.242
I think it's Jean.

35:56.002 --> 35:59.602
Yes, stay on the trail. Minimal comms.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.282
Radio compromised.

36:05.322 --> 36:06.522
I guess that's that.

36:07.162 --> 36:07.924
He already knew.

36:07.950 --> 36:09.187
This guy's pretty smart.

36:21.322 --> 36:22.202
What?

36:24.042 --> 36:25.362
Your brother knew what he was doing,

36:26.042 --> 36:28.642
and he never would've let us sacrifice ourselves for him.

36:29.122 --> 36:31.922
If this little truce of ours is gonna hold,

36:32.762 --> 36:34.802
let's not talk about my brother right now, okay?

36:34.922 --> 36:37.522
I just think you should know the whole story before you kill a person.

36:41.842 --> 36:43.322
If I were you,

36:43.922 --> 36:46.322
I wouldn't talk to me about my brother while I'm holding a gun.

36:48.922 --> 36:49.802
Good point.

36:50.322 --> 36:51.282
Let's go.

36:56.962 --> 36:58.602
Shit!

37:20.402 --> 37:21.642
Did you hear that?

37:21.922 --> 37:23.082
Hear what?

37:23.562 --> 37:25.562
If you have to ask, then you didn't hear it.

38:18.322 --> 38:21.002
Fragaria x ananassa.

38:21.202 --> 38:22.922
The wild strawberry.

38:23.362 --> 38:26.162
I wasn't aware you grew in these parts.

38:32.802 --> 38:34.362
They'll smell that a mile away.

38:37.602 --> 38:39.082
So how'd you know about me?

38:39.722 --> 38:41.010
Your tattoo.

38:41.036 --> 38:44.147
And just intuition, really.

38:44.522 --> 38:46.882
You get a feel for someone who wants you dead.

38:49.962 --> 38:50.922
Time?

38:51.922 --> 38:53.082
Two and a half hours.

38:55.842 --> 38:57.922
Gentlemen... good evening.

38:58.642 --> 39:01.762
I would like to speak to whoever has the walkie.

39:02.482 --> 39:04.402
We are under time constraints.

39:04.482 --> 39:06.482
We want to finish our work.

39:07.082 --> 39:09.122
End this now and no one else gets hurt.

39:09.242 --> 39:10.562
That's the wrong move.

39:11.042 --> 39:12.722
We have a conversation, find out what they want.

39:12.802 --> 39:13.922
We know what they want.

39:14.002 --> 39:15.122
They're drug dealers.

39:15.148 --> 39:16.427
They want their drugs.

39:17.842 --> 39:19.211
Allow me to be direct.

39:19.237 --> 39:21.227
I simply want the park ranger.

39:21.322 --> 39:23.442
The other guy, you can go.

39:24.722 --> 39:26.242
This don't mean I trust you.

39:26.642 --> 39:27.722
Move.

39:28.322 --> 39:31.162
If you change your mind, you know how to reach me.

39:31.602 --> 39:33.082
I'm in the book.

39:40.162 --> 39:41.322
How much further?

39:41.442 --> 39:43.042
We're close.
We should see it soon.

39:52.322 --> 39:53.682
Mister Sanderson.

39:54.122 --> 39:54.785
Break it down.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.467
No, it's not a home invasion.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.722
I don't want to involve the guy,

39:57.882 --> 40:00.802
I just wanna get in, make the call, and get out.

40:00.922 --> 40:01.802
Forget the window.

40:02.002 --> 40:03.082
No, this is our best chance.

40:03.282 --> 40:04.602
No, we go in this door.

40:04.722 --> 40:05.842
We don't have time for this.

40:06.002 --> 40:07.722
I'll go, then you go.

40:07.802 --> 40:10.242
I've got nowhere to run once I'm inside.

40:10.882 --> 40:12.682
You make one wrong move, you're gonna have a new asshole.

40:12.842 --> 40:13.842
You hear me?

40:29.922 --> 40:31.322
Now we do this my way.

40:31.882 --> 40:33.162
What happened to trust?

40:33.682 --> 40:36.322
I trust you to go pick up that phone and dial out.

40:46.482 --> 40:48.762
- What?
- It's dead.

40:48.842 --> 40:51.202
- Give it to me.
- What, you think I'm lying?

40:52.762 --> 40:54.282
Aw, shit.

40:57.922 --> 40:59.682
Just what do you think this is?

41:00.082 --> 41:01.682
A goddamn hotel?!

41:02.362 --> 41:04.242
Put the gun down right there on the box.

41:04.402 --> 41:05.542
Mister Sanderson...

41:05.568 --> 41:06.947
Do as I say, boy!

41:07.962 --> 41:09.042
Hurry.

41:10.322 --> 41:12.482
Okay, okay.

41:12.562 --> 41:13.842
I thought you said you knew this guy?

41:13.882 --> 41:16.082
I do. Mister Sanderson, it's me, Henry.

41:16.242 --> 41:17.522
Don't you recognize me?

41:17.602 --> 41:20.122
I've not gone dumb up here.

41:21.122 --> 41:22.802
You broke into my house.

41:23.322 --> 41:25.122
I got a right to defend it.

41:25.242 --> 41:27.002
Look, we ain't here for you, old man.

41:27.082 --> 41:30.682
We got drug dealers out there hunting us, trying to kill us.

41:30.842 --> 41:32.842
Seems to me like you two are trying to kill each other.

41:33.002 --> 41:35.122
- Well, it's complicated.
- Always is.

41:35.202 --> 41:36.722
Listen, we just need to use your phone,

41:36.882 --> 41:38.522
call the authorities, and get off this island...

41:38.602 --> 41:39.833
before anybody gets killed.

41:39.859 --> 41:40.907
Phone don't work.

41:41.242 --> 41:43.562
I had it cut off a couple of years back.

41:43.962 --> 41:45.602
Why the fuck is it sitting on the table then?

41:45.722 --> 41:47.082
It looks nice.

42:03.442 --> 42:04.727
Hello again.

42:04.753 --> 42:06.787
It's a nice house.

42:07.842 --> 42:10.442
Do me a favor, can you please send me the park ranger?

42:11.042 --> 42:12.101
He's not here.

42:12.127 --> 42:14.547
We gotta get out of here. Now.

42:14.642 --> 42:16.482
I ain't going nowhere.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.562
Mister Sanderson, this has nothing to do with you.

42:18.642 --> 42:20.661
These fellas want a bite.

42:20.687 --> 42:22.867
I'll give 'em a mouthful!

42:36.282 --> 42:38.638
Morris, cover the back.

42:38.664 --> 42:40.507
Nobody gets out.

42:46.002 --> 42:47.842
Piss off my land!

42:51.122 --> 42:52.482
This guy's kinda cranky.

42:55.282 --> 42:57.682
Hey, you people inside, I hate guns.

42:57.762 --> 43:00.642
They are very bad for the environment.

43:00.722 --> 43:02.202
However, I'm not stupid.

43:03.642 --> 43:06.082
Gentlemen. A little help.

43:07.922 --> 43:09.002
Get down!

43:16.842 --> 43:19.082
I get hikers here from time to time,

43:19.402 --> 43:21.482
trying to run me outta my home.

43:21.642 --> 43:24.162
Hikers? You seriously think those are hikers?!

43:24.242 --> 43:25.802
Sir! We gotta leave this house.

43:25.882 --> 43:27.562
We're sitting ducks here and you know it.

43:27.682 --> 43:29.282
Take that.

43:29.402 --> 43:30.242
What, am I invisible?

43:30.268 --> 43:31.082
Why him and not me?

43:31.122 --> 43:32.242
I don't know you.

43:32.322 --> 43:34.162
I do know fellas like those assholes.

43:34.242 --> 43:37.162
Couple shots around their feet, they'll run off like squealing pigs.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.882
- You'll see.
- I don't think you understand...

43:38.962 --> 43:40.562
the situation that we're in right now.

43:40.642 --> 43:41.962
We appreciate your help,

43:42.042 --> 43:43.802
but for the last time, this doesn't seem...

43:53.322 --> 43:54.642
Give us the ranger...

43:54.722 --> 43:58.482
and we'll go away like a bad dream you won't remember in the morning.

44:04.722 --> 44:07.042
Fellas, I don't know what's gone on between the two of you.

44:07.162 --> 44:08.482
You gotta get past it.

44:08.562 --> 44:12.442
Old saying goes, Hang together, or hang separately.

44:16.522 --> 44:18.922
A knife? What the fuck am I gonna do with a knife?

44:19.002 --> 44:20.682
Man can do a lot with a knife.

44:20.722 --> 44:22.242
That's how much I trust you.

44:22.682 --> 44:23.842
Now just stay low.

44:23.962 --> 44:27.402
You're gonna have to fall back before they get us surrounded.

44:27.482 --> 44:28.402
Fine by me.

44:28.522 --> 44:31.242
No. Not fine.
You're coming with us.

44:31.282 --> 44:35.082
I've got my ways of getting through this. Just go.

44:41.002 --> 44:42.373
You boys get outta here.

44:42.399 --> 44:43.427
Go out the back.

44:43.482 --> 44:46.362
Head east.
 Oh, hell, Henry, you know the route.

44:46.482 --> 44:47.682
No!

44:49.682 --> 44:52.322
Go before I shoot you myself.

44:53.122 --> 44:54.882
This ain't a negotiation.

44:55.002 --> 44:57.002
You got the rest of your life to be a hero.

44:58.002 --> 44:59.482
I just got this one time.

44:59.602 --> 45:01.002
I brought this to you.

45:01.082 --> 45:03.522
You stay, I stay.

45:04.682 --> 45:08.402
Well... okay then.

45:09.522 --> 45:11.202
I guess that settles it.

45:14.362 --> 45:15.402
No!

45:22.242 --> 45:24.682
He is gone. He's gone.

45:25.122 --> 45:27.202
And I'll be happy to let you go with him,

45:27.922 --> 45:29.882
but I need you to get off this island.

45:30.722 --> 45:34.002
You mean sometimes, you have to leave a guy in trouble?

45:49.042 --> 45:49.962
Do you have any more shells?

45:50.042 --> 45:51.162
I didn't think I would need any.

45:51.282 --> 45:52.482
Well, that's just perfect.

45:52.842 --> 45:55.842
Like the old guy said, "A man can do a lot with a knife."

46:13.002 --> 46:14.162
They're gone.

46:15.922 --> 46:17.282
Morris, come in.

46:17.842 --> 46:20.322
I'm hit. They are gone.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.602
- You're hit where?
- Shoulder.

46:23.682 --> 46:25.682
Use the other one. Move your ass.

46:25.802 --> 46:28.602
Hey. Where did they go?

46:34.082 --> 46:37.362
Kiss my geriatric ass!

46:41.202 --> 46:42.562
Are you sure about that?

46:42.682 --> 46:45.522
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Stand him up.

46:52.082 --> 46:54.242
Organic. Good man.

46:54.362 --> 46:58.522
When I was a little boy at my grandmama's place,

46:58.642 --> 47:00.322
she had a lovely goose.

47:00.562 --> 47:06.442
I named her Edith, after the French singer Edith Piaf.

47:07.482 --> 47:09.362
I truly loved that goose.

47:10.482 --> 47:12.242
Everybody thought it was funny.

47:12.402 --> 47:15.162
Then one night when we were at dinner,

47:15.322 --> 47:19.882
my grandmama said to me, "Edith tastes good, no?"

47:20.882 --> 47:22.402
I ran out of that table,

47:22.482 --> 47:26.602
I puke up, I cry like a child.

47:27.602 --> 47:29.642
Ever since, I became a vegan.

47:32.882 --> 47:37.322
I'm telling you, I had to kill her.

47:47.362 --> 47:50.002
We're losing time. I need my diver.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.842
My patience is losing weight...

47:52.922 --> 47:55.522
No, no, that's why they say, they say,

47:56.602 --> 47:58.402
I'm getting real pissed.

48:01.122 --> 48:02.522
Let's go.

48:06.962 --> 48:09.322
We've gotta get to the other side of the island, where your boat is.

48:09.642 --> 48:11.242
Yeah, I kind of lied about that.

48:11.922 --> 48:12.842
I paid a guy to bring me here.

48:13.042 --> 48:14.522
He's supposed to come back in the morning.

48:15.802 --> 48:16.922
You got a plan B?

48:19.602 --> 48:22.682
You hide till morning and make it through the night.

48:22.802 --> 48:24.362
And you want me to hide?

48:24.402 --> 48:25.602
What are you gonna do?

48:25.722 --> 48:27.282
I'm gonna lead them away from here.

48:27.762 --> 48:30.162
Right now, they track one of us, they catch both of us.

48:30.242 --> 48:31.962
I'm gonna take the fight to this maniac.

48:32.082 --> 48:34.082
- With what?
- Whatever I got.

48:34.802 --> 48:37.722
All we got is this.

48:40.842 --> 48:44.322
I got some matches,

48:44.882 --> 48:47.202
a spool of fishing line and some rope.

48:47.562 --> 48:49.642
Well, that'll scare the shit out of 'em.

48:52.042 --> 48:55.642
Look, man, I came prepared for one night.

48:55.922 --> 48:57.642
I didn't come prepared for war.

48:58.202 --> 48:59.722
Yeah, well, this war came to us.

48:59.882 --> 49:04.282
Listen, if we both survive this, let's talk, okay?

49:10.562 --> 49:12.682
Your brother was a wonderful soldier.

49:13.002 --> 49:14.762
He had to be in Special Forces.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.162
Always had to be the first man through the door.

49:18.522 --> 49:21.162
I wonder what or who made him that way, huh?

49:21.322 --> 49:25.042
Always pushing.
Maybe you think about that, too.

49:25.722 --> 49:26.842
I'll bet you do.

49:28.922 --> 49:31.882
Not a day goes by I don't wish it wasn't me instead of him.

49:33.362 --> 49:34.802
Not a day.

49:37.522 --> 49:39.082
I'm gonna be needing this.

49:57.042 --> 49:59.562
Gentlemen, I'll put it simply.

50:01.242 --> 50:02.602
Henry, I know you.

50:02.922 --> 50:05.682
Henry, I know a lot about you.

50:06.962 --> 50:11.562
I also know you are trained in deep sea rescue and retrieval.

50:12.402 --> 50:15.762
Which makes you worth a lot to me.

50:20.802 --> 50:23.882
Now, if you don't help me to get what I came for...

50:27.122 --> 50:33.122
I will have to go after your family and kill them, one by one.

50:35.282 --> 50:38.802
And I will start with your son first.

50:41.562 --> 50:44.842
Henry, please, it's your final chance.

50:49.122 --> 50:52.362
I take it by your silence that you've made the wrong decision.

50:55.602 --> 50:58.762
All right, it's time to hunt.
Let's go.

52:05.362 --> 52:06.802
Fuck me.

52:09.842 --> 52:10.882
You!

52:19.282 --> 52:21.282
I thought you wanted the ranger dead.

52:23.962 --> 52:24.802
I did.

52:37.202 --> 52:38.482
What changed?

52:42.802 --> 52:43.882
My mind.

54:08.642 --> 54:11.482
Fuck, help.

55:19.522 --> 55:21.162
Come on!

55:21.522 --> 55:22.882
Pass the fuck out!

55:22.962 --> 55:25.002
Come on!

55:25.842 --> 55:29.322
Pass out!
Pass the fuck out!

55:45.322 --> 55:46.802
Hey.

55:47.922 --> 55:50.802
Hey. Come on. Wake up.

55:52.322 --> 55:53.151
You can't die yet.

55:53.177 --> 55:54.787
I won't get a chance to kill you.

55:54.962 --> 55:56.282
Yeah, that'd be a shame.

56:00.202 --> 56:01.922
Look what your friend dropped.

56:04.042 --> 56:06.122
Look, man, I've got a lot of questions to ask.

56:07.482 --> 56:08.882
Well, I've got answers.

56:09.682 --> 56:11.322
Maybe even some you don't want.

56:11.642 --> 56:13.282
But I'll always tell you the truth.

56:19.642 --> 56:21.042
Let's get outta here.

56:21.122 --> 56:23.402
I located a canoe in case you don't feel like swimming.

56:24.562 --> 56:25.842
I'll do you one better.

56:33.282 --> 56:36.082
Aw, fuck. No, no, no!

56:37.802 --> 56:41.202
Has the Ranger been captured, yes or no?

56:42.842 --> 56:44.642
You're so fucked.

56:46.322 --> 56:49.202
By my count, that's three of you down so far.

56:49.362 --> 56:50.802
Fuck off.

56:54.362 --> 56:55.882
Okay, let's go.

56:56.042 --> 56:58.042
No, no.
We gotta see what's what.

56:58.882 --> 57:01.122
- How many of you are left?
- Eat a dick.

57:09.362 --> 57:11.162
You know, when I was in the yard,

57:11.242 --> 57:12.722
when we wanted somebody to talk,

57:12.882 --> 57:15.282
we'd carve one of the eyes out.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.402
Though I notice you've got two of 'em.

57:18.402 --> 57:19.682
You wouldn't.

57:20.442 --> 57:21.522
You've got three seconds.

57:21.548 --> 57:22.627
You gotta stop him!

57:22.682 --> 57:24.642
Oh, yeah, he's really gonna listen to me.

57:25.042 --> 57:28.282
- One...
- Okay! Okay, okay.

57:31.602 --> 57:34.602
Xander. His name is Xander.

57:34.962 --> 57:36.682
He wants you to make a dive.

57:36.882 --> 57:37.655
For the drugs.

57:37.681 --> 57:39.227
Told you it was drugs.

57:39.362 --> 57:41.722
- Don't brag.
- You assholes, you killed our diver.

57:42.522 --> 57:44.962
Xander knew, he knew you were trained.

57:45.762 --> 57:47.242
So when you killed Eto,

57:47.602 --> 57:49.162
we needed you to make the dive.

57:49.282 --> 57:51.002
How did he know that I could dive?

57:51.122 --> 57:52.362
He knows things.

57:52.722 --> 57:53.962
The drugs are in the lake?

57:54.322 --> 57:56.562
It's a shipment of heroin.

57:56.882 --> 57:58.181
It went down in one of the lakes.

57:58.207 --> 57:59.427
How many of you are left?

57:59.522 --> 58:01.162
- Just Xander.
- Just one guy?

58:01.242 --> 58:04.042
- Yeah.
- Good. Knock him out.

58:06.082 --> 58:08.202
- Let's get the hell out of Dodge.
- Let's go.

58:18.322 --> 58:20.442
Leaving so soon, Mister Taylor?

58:20.882 --> 58:23.402
Yoo-hoo.

58:23.802 --> 58:24.762
Over here.

58:25.242 --> 58:26.332
I'll make this simple.

58:26.358 --> 58:28.387
Half a million for ten minutes of work.

58:29.762 --> 58:31.002
You have no one left.

58:31.282 --> 58:34.282
We know that you're the last one standing on your side of the equation.

58:34.962 --> 58:38.002
Your best bet is to get back on your boat

58:38.122 --> 58:39.882
and travel on out of here.

58:39.962 --> 58:42.082
If you leave now without hurting anybody else,

58:42.362 --> 58:44.162
I'll let the police handle you.

58:44.562 --> 58:47.362
If you don't, I'll come for you myself.

58:48.082 --> 58:50.882
Trust me, you'd prefer the police.

58:52.802 --> 58:53.989
Bring that fire!

58:54.015 --> 58:56.387
I like this side of you, Henry.

58:57.002 --> 58:59.802
I know what you want, and I'm not operating any dive.

59:00.122 --> 59:01.522
You've lost your mind.

59:01.562 --> 59:03.802
You've left nothing but bodies behind you tonight.

59:04.042 --> 59:07.122
Then you'll want to listen closely...

59:07.242 --> 59:11.282
when I tell you I have someone you want to keep safe.

59:12.602 --> 59:13.842
There's somebody else on this island?

59:14.482 --> 59:16.042
What color was that canoe you found?

59:16.122 --> 59:18.122
- Canoe?
- Yeah, what color was it?

59:18.282 --> 59:19.362
Silver and blue.

59:19.442 --> 59:23.722
Yes, I have a woman who would like to speak to you.

59:25.042 --> 59:26.082
Henry?

59:27.202 --> 59:28.242
Kayla?

59:28.362 --> 59:31.442
You didn't show up for our date so I-I-I came out here.

59:32.442 --> 59:33.786
This man's got a gun.

59:33.812 --> 59:35.347
He's got a gun, Henry.

59:36.642 --> 59:39.002
It's true. Even though I hate them.

59:39.362 --> 59:40.779
Kayla, hang on.

59:40.805 --> 59:42.787
I'm coming for you.

59:43.482 --> 59:46.482
After you do your job, you can leave with the young lady.

59:46.882 --> 59:48.282
You have ten minutes.

59:48.402 --> 59:49.799
If you don't come...

59:49.825 --> 59:52.547
well, let's not talk about negatives.

59:57.162 --> 59:58.642
You're in no shape to take this guy.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.922
Just come in after me, but keep your distance.

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:03.482
If you see an opportunity to move in, take it.

01:00:03.602 --> 01:00:06.442
Otherwise, keep your eyes on Kayla no matter what, okay?

01:00:06.562 --> 01:00:07.242
Forget that, man.

01:00:07.268 --> 01:00:08.362
I say we take this boat...

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:09.562
and get the hell out of here.

01:00:09.588 --> 01:00:10.507
What about Kayla?

01:00:10.882 --> 01:00:12.722
It's my fault that she's even here.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.282
That's another person you wanna leave behind.

01:00:14.362 --> 01:00:15.402
What is it with you?

01:00:15.522 --> 01:00:17.162
I just wanna make a trade with this guy.

01:00:17.282 --> 01:00:19.882
Hopefully he'll let her go, you get her,

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:24.402
you find anything that floats and you get outta here.

01:00:24.562 --> 01:00:26.482
Okay? Straight to the mainland, don't look back.

01:00:26.562 --> 01:00:28.362
Find the police, tell them everything.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.362
Well, not everything.

01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:31.371
Okay, go, come on.

01:00:31.397 --> 01:00:32.827
This guy will kill you.

01:00:32.882 --> 01:00:34.562
Well, I guess you should thank him.

01:00:36.722 --> 01:00:38.122
Good luck.

01:00:54.962 --> 01:00:57.962
You know, these beans are fair trade from Colombia.

01:00:58.082 --> 01:01:00.402
No slash-and-burn agriculture.

01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:03.122
But you could care less, I'm sure.

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:05.562
Where is she?

01:01:07.162 --> 01:01:09.122
- Where's your friend?
- He left.

01:01:09.362 --> 01:01:11.042
He took Kayla's canoe to get help.

01:01:11.322 --> 01:01:14.442
But by the time he gets there, we'll be done and you'll be gone.

01:01:14.602 --> 01:01:16.322
Why do I doubt that?

01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:18.362
Show me Kayla or I turn around.

01:01:18.802 --> 01:01:19.942
Mmm, that's good.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.107
But you forget,

01:01:21.162 --> 01:01:23.082
you're not the one who's calling the shots here.

01:01:23.202 --> 01:01:24.602
You need me to get what you want.

01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:26.522
You just spent the last two hours proving it.

01:01:27.682 --> 01:01:29.962
Very true. Okay.

01:01:31.642 --> 01:01:34.429
Outside, girl, now.

01:01:34.455 --> 01:01:36.507
There she is.

01:01:38.482 --> 01:01:39.922
Let her go first.

01:01:40.482 --> 01:01:43.962
I can threaten her, you can say let her go,

01:01:44.042 --> 01:01:46.922
you can threaten me, and I can put my, uh,

01:01:47.762 --> 01:01:50.922
on her throat.
It's all one big circle, you know.

01:01:51.002 --> 01:01:52.882
And I don't have the time.

01:01:52.962 --> 01:01:55.762
She waits here, or she die.

01:01:56.242 --> 01:01:57.409
You're the only one left.

01:01:57.435 --> 01:01:58.787
We're gonna do this my way.

01:02:02.562 --> 01:02:04.322
You lose, park ranger.

01:02:04.348 --> 01:02:05.867
Put the gun down.

01:02:07.482 --> 01:02:08.802
That's right.

01:02:10.082 --> 01:02:15.042
You know, you should learn to tie better knots... next time.

01:02:15.842 --> 01:02:18.762
Now then. Shall we?

Get on.

01:02:34.482 --> 01:02:36.962
I'm making the dive. Let her go.

01:02:37.522 --> 01:02:40.202
Or the girl stay here, you know, uh, you finish the job,

01:02:40.282 --> 01:02:43.082
and then both of you drive to the sunset.

01:02:43.162 --> 01:02:46.722
Let him think about what I'll do to her if he fucks with us.

01:02:47.402 --> 01:02:49.122
Francois, be a gentleman.

01:02:49.322 --> 01:02:49.962
Just hang in there.

01:02:49.988 --> 01:02:51.267
I'm gonna get you out of this, okay?

01:02:51.402 --> 01:02:52.362
I'm not going anywhere.

01:02:54.322 --> 01:02:55.882
He promise. Come on.

01:03:07.442 --> 01:03:10.322
You know, Mister Taylor, I'm not a bad guy.

01:03:10.882 --> 01:03:12.442
I was in the service like yourself.

01:03:12.562 --> 01:03:14.802
Oh, yeah?
Which side?

01:03:15.242 --> 01:03:16.802
That's not very nice.

01:03:17.802 --> 01:03:19.882
Well, now you deal drugs and kill people.

01:03:20.242 --> 01:03:21.802
It's so true.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:24.922
Where did I go wrong, huh?

01:04:38.762 --> 01:04:40.962
I should've killed you when I had the chance.

01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:46.402
- You okay?
- Yeah. What's going on here?

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:47.146
What's going on?

01:04:47.172 --> 01:04:48.707
We're getting the hell out of here.

01:04:48.762 --> 01:04:50.482
We can't just leave Henry.

01:04:50.642 --> 01:04:52.442
Henry can handle himself, trust me.

01:04:52.562 --> 01:04:54.122
That man will kill him.

01:04:54.202 --> 01:04:58.002
Look, he will not hurt him until he gets the drugs.

01:04:58.602 --> 01:05:01.442
We've got time to go get the cops and get back here.

01:05:01.602 --> 01:05:02.602
Now let's go.

01:05:04.882 --> 01:05:11.242
Stop. Put your hands up, turn around slowly and face me.

01:05:13.802 --> 01:05:14.962
What are you doing?

01:05:15.122 --> 01:05:16.962
No police, Mister Shotgun.

01:05:17.162 --> 01:05:19.842
- Fuck me.
- I'd rather not.

01:05:25.802 --> 01:05:27.402
So how are we doing?

01:05:28.442 --> 01:05:30.242
The suit's a bit tight.

01:05:30.362 --> 01:05:32.882
He must've been kinda short, your diver.

01:05:33.002 --> 01:05:36.322
Don't insult Eto. Clock's ticking.

01:05:39.162 --> 01:05:40.442
So you can see.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:45.602
- Thank you.
- Attach this to the bag, tug twice.

01:05:45.882 --> 01:05:47.162
You have eight minutes.

01:05:47.282 --> 01:05:51.162
In nine minutes, your lady friend will be dead.

01:05:51.722 --> 01:05:53.522
Okay? Don't be late.

01:05:53.642 --> 01:05:56.402
Just give me thirty seconds to clear out of the way before you pull it up.

01:05:56.602 --> 01:06:00.242
Oh, Mister Taylor. Be careful.

01:06:06.882 --> 01:06:08.082
So what are we doing here?

01:06:08.242 --> 01:06:09.322
Shut up.

01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:11.882
I can see it in your eyes, you're not a killer.

01:06:12.042 --> 01:06:14.722
You can't see shit in my eyes, except my eyes.

01:06:15.082 --> 01:06:17.442
Look, tonight's been hard on all of us,

01:06:17.842 --> 01:06:21.362
except Xander quite often has me do a lot more to distract people.

01:06:21.642 --> 01:06:23.242
A lot more. So,

01:06:23.362 --> 01:06:27.082
it may have been difficult for you people, except for me,

01:06:27.122 --> 01:06:28.962
it's kind of been a breeze.

01:06:29.042 --> 01:06:30.122
So you're just a hooker?

01:06:30.242 --> 01:06:32.162
I'm so hurt.

01:06:32.282 --> 01:06:33.762
If you're gonna shoot me,

01:06:33.882 --> 01:06:35.082
shoot me.

01:06:35.122 --> 01:06:36.562
Okay.

01:06:42.482 --> 01:06:43.442
Shit!

01:07:02.842 --> 01:07:04.802
I can tell you're in pretty rough shape.

01:07:06.642 --> 01:07:09.802
Why don't you just come on out and we'll...

01:07:13.282 --> 01:07:14.562
And we'll work this out.

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.922
Xander, a speedboat's approaching the dock.

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.682
It's two police officers.
What should I do?

01:07:21.922 --> 01:07:23.626
Be normal. Tell them you're fishing.

01:07:23.652 --> 01:07:24.787
Agree to pay the fine.

01:07:24.882 --> 01:07:26.602
And, uh, be quick.

01:07:33.522 --> 01:07:34.716
Good morning, officers.

01:07:34.742 --> 01:07:35.987
What can I do for you?

01:07:36.042 --> 01:07:38.162
You haven't seen the park ranger this morning, have you?

01:07:38.442 --> 01:07:40.962
No, I, uh, just got on the island a couple minutes ago.

01:07:41.202 --> 01:07:43.002
Been doing some late night fishing.

01:07:43.442 --> 01:07:44.492
Is it season already?

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:45.667
I don't think it's...

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:47.320
Uh, no, okay, you caught me.

01:07:47.346 --> 01:07:49.347
I just, I always get a head start.

01:07:49.682 --> 01:07:50.682
I'll pay the fine.

01:07:50.802 --> 01:07:53.562
Well, ma'am, we got a report of a loud noise coming from the island.

01:07:53.642 --> 01:07:56.242
We tried to reach the ranger, but couldn't get through so...

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.542
I don't know what to tell you.

01:07:57.568 --> 01:07:58.747
I haven't seen anybody yet.

01:07:58.802 --> 01:08:02.402
Hey! Shoot her! Shoot her!

01:08:02.842 --> 01:08:04.842
- Shoot her!
- What the hell?

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:09.581
Kayla, meet me at the pick-up site.

01:09:09.607 --> 01:09:10.907
I've got the package.

01:09:13.042 --> 01:09:14.761
Be convincing.

01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:19.242
Sounds good.
I took care of our friend.

01:09:19.841 --> 01:09:21.002
Let's get out of here.

01:09:23.402 --> 01:09:24.602
Very nice.

01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:40.042
Good, good work.

01:09:40.162 --> 01:09:42.962
Oh, I'm not done yet.

01:09:44.761 --> 01:09:46.642
This is a Magpul ACR.

01:09:47.202 --> 01:09:50.442
It works after being submerged in water hours,

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:52.642
days, even weeks.

01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:54.762
You're great.

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:56.522
Come on. We're done here.

01:09:56.722 --> 01:09:58.962
You're gonna turn the key, drive to shore.

01:09:59.042 --> 01:10:01.882
I'm gonna get Kayla and we're getting outta here.

01:10:01.962 --> 01:10:04.962
You look at me funny and you die.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:07.882
Oh! You're the boss.

01:10:21.162 --> 01:10:23.722
So remind me, what are we doing here?

01:10:23.882 --> 01:10:25.002
The cops are here.

01:10:25.082 --> 01:10:26.962
We're gonna hand over the drugs and you're going to jail.

01:10:27.082 --> 01:10:28.082
You got it?

01:10:29.802 --> 01:10:31.242
You mean those cops?

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:33.522
All right, move it.

01:10:38.162 --> 01:10:40.722
- Henry! Henry!
- Hey, shut up!

01:10:40.882 --> 01:10:42.002
- Oh, thank God, Henry,
- Henry.

01:10:42.122 --> 01:10:42.856
you have to help me!
 He's gonna kill me!

01:10:42.882 --> 01:10:43.267
She's with him.

01:10:43.362 --> 01:10:43.897
No, Henry, I'm not!

01:10:43.923 --> 01:10:44.627
She is with Xander.

01:10:44.722 --> 01:10:46.082
Keep moving.

01:10:46.322 --> 01:10:47.642
Keep going.

01:10:47.722 --> 01:10:48.528
Clay, what are you doing?

01:10:48.554 --> 01:10:49.747
He's crazy!
 He's gonna kill me!

01:10:49.802 --> 01:10:50.922
- Shut up!
- You have to help me, Henry!

01:10:51.082 --> 01:10:52.242
- Don't let him hurt me!
- Shut up!

01:10:52.362 --> 01:10:54.722
- He's crazy!...
- I am not lying to you.

01:10:54.802 --> 01:10:56.682
- Do not point that gun at me, man.
- -

01:10:56.722 --> 01:10:57.677
Don't let him hurt me, Henry, please!

01:10:57.703 --> 01:10:58.762
Listen, do not point that gun at me.

01:10:58.802 --> 01:11:00.362
- Please. Please.
- Point that gun at me.

01:11:00.442 --> 01:11:01.709
Listen to me, okay?

01:11:01.735 --> 01:11:02.867
He's crazy!

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:39.842
Hey! You want this? Huh?

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:43.082
You want this? Come on!

01:11:46.082 --> 01:11:47.850
You fucked up, baby.

01:11:47.876 --> 01:11:49.467
That's not good.

01:11:53.122 --> 01:11:54.442
Henry.

01:11:58.122 --> 01:11:59.442
You know, Mister Taylor,

01:11:59.962 --> 01:12:04.802
most people never use all five senses at once.

01:12:05.242 --> 01:12:07.602
Me? I use everything I've got.

01:12:07.682 --> 01:12:09.307
That's why I'm better.

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:10.587
That's my edge.

01:12:14.562 --> 01:12:17.402
Oh! We get to play in trees.

01:12:20.922 --> 01:12:22.922
I'm coming, Mister Taylor.

01:13:20.842 --> 01:13:22.722
There's no shame in defeat.

01:13:23.442 --> 01:13:25.162
Sleep, my child.

01:14:09.442 --> 01:14:10.762
You gotta be kidding me.

01:14:34.722 --> 01:14:36.602
A man has got to know his limitations.

01:14:49.202 --> 01:14:52.682
Well, Mr. Taylor, you can always say "almost."

01:14:55.482 --> 01:14:57.082
Bye, Mister Taylor.

01:15:09.762 --> 01:15:11.242
Almost.

01:15:23.002 --> 01:15:23.975
Fucking gasoline.

01:15:24.001 --> 01:15:25.947
I knew it would ruin everything.

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:57.922
Come on.

01:15:59.802 --> 01:16:01.002
Thanks.

01:16:02.122 --> 01:16:03.682
Not a fucking word.

01:16:04.082 --> 01:16:06.042
Oh, my lips are sealed.
