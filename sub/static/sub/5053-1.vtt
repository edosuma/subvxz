cold fins now, are you?

I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.741

07:45.825 --> 07:48.203
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

- Flounder, will you relax?

07:51.456 --> 07:53.709

Ariel, how you doin', kid?

09:16.429 --> 09:20.142
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.145
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy...

09:23.187 --> 09:26.524
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.

09:30.111 --> 09:34.785
Oh! Oh! Look at this.

09:34.868 --> 09:38.288
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

09:38.372 --> 09:42.376
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

09:42.459 --> 09:45.754
Humans use these little babies...

09:45.838 --> 09:47.798
to straighten their hair out.

09:47.881 --> 09:52.637
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and violee...

09:52.721 --> 09:56.643
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair

09:56.727 --> 09:58.812
that humans go nuts over.

09:58.895 --> 10:00.897
A dinglehopper.

10:00.981 --> 10:02.691
- What about that one?
- Ah!

10:02.774 --> 10:08.573
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!

10:08.656 --> 10:13.911
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!

10:13.995 --> 10:19.210
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical
times when humans used to sit around

10:19.294 --> 10:22.548
and stare at each other all day.

10:22.590 --> 10:24.592
Got very boring.

10:24.633 --> 10:29.180
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

10:29.263 --> 10:31.557
Allow me.

10:31.599 --> 10:33.100
Music!

10:33.184 --> 10:35.479
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

10:35.562 --> 10:37.939
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!

10:38.023 --> 10:39.401
The concert was today?

10:39.443 --> 10:41.695
You could make
a little planter out of it.

10:41.779 --> 10:45.115
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

10:45.157 --> 10:46.742
Any time, sweetie!

10:46.784 --> 10:48.952
Any time.

11:02.803 --> 11:06.808
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

11:06.891 --> 11:12.313
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's
celebration, now, would we?

11:12.355 --> 11:16.984
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!

11:17.068 --> 11:22.074
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,

11:22.157 --> 11:26.372
when I lived in the palace.

11:27.665 --> 11:30.167
And now look at me.

11:30.251 --> 11:33.045
Wasted away to practically nothing.

11:33.129 --> 11:37.175
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

11:37.259 --> 11:42.305
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

11:42.347 --> 11:47.394
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

11:47.477 --> 11:49.648
Flotsam! Jetsam!

11:49.732 --> 11:54.988
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

11:55.030 --> 12:00.118
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.

12:03.955 --> 12:08.002
I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

12:08.085 --> 12:09.670
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

12:09.754 --> 12:11.841
As a result of your careless behavior...

12:11.924 --> 12:13.760
Careless and reckless behavior!

12:13.843 --> 12:16.054
...the entire celebration was, uh...

12:16.137 --> 12:19.807
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

12:19.891 --> 12:22.018
This concert was to be

12:22.101 --> 12:25.689
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

12:25.773 --> 12:29.526
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

12:29.610 --> 12:31.195
But it wasn't her fault...

12:31.278 --> 12:34.950
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

12:35.034 --> 12:38.538
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

12:38.580 --> 12:41.792
And... And we... Whoa!

12:41.875 --> 12:43.794
And then we were safe.

12:43.877 --> 12:46.630
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."

12:46.713 --> 12:48.382
Seagull?

12:48.423 --> 12:51.176
What? Oh!

12:51.259 --> 12:53.345
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?

12:53.428 --> 12:55.890
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

12:55.932 --> 13:00.188
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

13:00.271 --> 13:04.901
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

13:04.943 --> 13:07.529
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

13:07.612 --> 13:11.575
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

13:11.659 --> 13:14.161
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

13:14.245 --> 13:16.914
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

13:17.039 --> 13:20.461
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

13:20.513 --> 13:23.423
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

13:23.464 --> 13:27.886
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

13:27.970 --> 13:29.930
Is that clear?

13:35.144 --> 13:37.730
Hmph! Teenagers.

13:37.813 --> 13:40.108
They think they know everything.

13:40.150 --> 13:43.822
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

13:43.905 --> 13:47.909
Do you think I was too hard on her?

13:47.993 --> 13:50.120
Definitely not.

13:50.162 --> 13:55.251
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.921
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.841
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.677
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.432
Ariel needs constant supervision.

14:07.515 --> 14:10.268
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

14:10.353 --> 14:11.437
All the time.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.148
And you are just the crab to do it.

14:15.524 --> 14:18.819
How do I get myself
into these situations?

14:18.861 --> 14:20.863
I should be writing symphonies,

14:20.946 --> 14:24.617
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.

14:27.287 --> 14:31.794
Hmm? What is that girl up to?

15:00.410 --> 15:01.369
Huh?

15:08.251 --> 15:11.379
Ariel, are you OK?

15:11.462 --> 15:14.091
If only I could
make him understand.

15:14.174 --> 15:17.179
I just don't see things the way he does.

15:17.263 --> 15:21.434
I don't see how a world

18:32.929 --> 18:37.158
Ariel, what are you...
How could you... What is all this?

18:37.242 --> 18:40.745
It's, uh... It's just my collection.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.875
Oh, I see.

18:43.959 --> 18:48.756
Your collection, hmm.
If your father knew about this place...

18:48.840 --> 18:50.800
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

18:50.842 --> 18:53.344
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

18:53.428 --> 18:57.373
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

18:57.457 --> 18:59.267
Come with me, I'll take you home

18:59.350 --> 19:01.769
and get you something warm to drink.

19:01.853 --> 19:04.732
- What do you suppose...
- Ariel?

19:06.152 --> 19:08.696
Ariel?

19:18.707 --> 19:22.002
Ariel, what are you...

19:22.043 --> 19:24.671
Jumpin' jellyfish!

19:26.757 --> 19:31.513
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!

20:09.098 --> 20:12.226
Max! Here, boy!

20:17.942 --> 20:21.613
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

20:21.696 --> 20:24.616
Come on, Max.

20:24.699 --> 20:28.036
Good boy. Good boy.

20:32.791 --> 20:36.129
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?

20:36.212 --> 20:38.633
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.

20:38.716 --> 20:41.052
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

20:41.136 --> 20:44.889
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

20:44.973 --> 20:48.935
I've never seen a human
this close before.

20:49.018 --> 20:54.150
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?

20:54.233 --> 20:57.653
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

20:57.695 --> 21:00.531
Not that one.

21:00.614 --> 21:03.745
The one playing the snarfblatt.

21:03.828 --> 21:06.498
Silence, silence.

21:06.582 --> 21:09.501
It is now my honor and privilege

21:09.585 --> 21:11.879
to present our esteemed Prince Eric

21:11.962 --> 21:14.673
with a very special, very expensive,

21:14.757 --> 21:17.593
very large birthday present.

21:17.676 --> 21:21.222
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

21:21.264 --> 21:23.183
I know.

21:23.224 --> 21:26.062
Happy birthday, Eric.

21:31.067 --> 21:33.820
Uh, gee, Grim... Ha!

21:33.904 --> 21:37.366
It's, uh... It's really somethin'.

21:37.450 --> 21:39.452
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

21:39.535 --> 21:43.498
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

21:43.581 --> 21:46.000
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

21:46.042 --> 21:50.298
You're not still sore because I didn't
fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?

21:50.381 --> 21:53.677
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.

21:53.719 --> 21:59.391
The entire kingdom wants to see you
happily settled with the right girl.

21:59.475 --> 22:02.353
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...

22:02.394 --> 22:05.397
I just haven't found her yet.

22:05.481 --> 22:08.735
Perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

22:08.819 --> 22:11.490
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

22:11.573 --> 22:16.245
Without a doubt, it'll just...
bam... hit me, like lightning.

22:21.793 --> 22:23.753
Hurricane a-comin'!

22:23.837 --> 22:29.050
Stand fast! Secure the riggin'!

22:45.027 --> 22:50.450
Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden
on the move here! Yo!

22:50.533 --> 22:53.787
Ariel!

23:28.536 --> 23:30.789
Look out!

23:42.845 --> 23:46.349
Grim! Hang on!

23:49.227 --> 23:51.813
Max!

24:05.246 --> 24:07.498
Jump, Max!

24:07.581 --> 24:11.336
Come on, boy! Jump! You can do it, Max!

24:19.719 --> 24:22.013
Eric!

25:02.102 --> 25:05.856
Is he... dead?

25:05.939 --> 25:07.900
It's hard to say.

25:12.280 --> 25:15.869
Oh, I... I can't make out a heartbeat.

25:15.952 --> 25:19.080
No, look! He's breathing.

25:20.624 --> 25:22.584

27:54.174 --> 27:56.178
You've been in there all morning.

27:59.558 --> 28:02.477
What is with her lately?

28:04.980 --> 28:09.818
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well!

28:14.532 --> 28:18.246
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

28:18.329 --> 28:22.167

Ariel's in love.

and back in the water where it belongs?

28:59.791 --> 29:03.630
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

32:32.121 --> 32:35.959
Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

32:36.043 --> 32:38.253
I've got an urgent message
from the sea king.

32:38.337 --> 32:40.505
The sea king?

32:40.589 --> 32:44.092
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

32:44.234 --> 32:46.803
Oh, he knows!

32:46.887 --> 32:49.806
Hey, let's see now.

32:49.848 --> 32:54.062
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

32:56.316 --> 33:01.112
Come in, Sebastian.

33:01.996 --> 33:04.166
I mustn't overreact.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.828
I must remain calm.

33:13.016 --> 33:15.545
Yes?

33:15.628 --> 33:18.633
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

33:18.675 --> 33:21.887
I'm concerned about Ariel.

33:21.971 --> 33:25.307
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?

33:25.349 --> 33:30.354
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

33:30.437 --> 33:34.149
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

33:34.233 --> 33:36.318
You haven't noticed, hmm?

33:36.360 --> 33:39.197
Oh, well, I...

33:39.281 --> 33:42.703
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

33:43.704 --> 33:47.666
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

33:47.708 --> 33:50.961
Keeping something?

33:51.044 --> 33:52.964
About Ariel?

33:56.092 --> 33:59.554
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

33:59.596 --> 34:05.145
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

34:05.228 --> 34:08.357
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

34:08.399 --> 34:13.154
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

34:13.237 --> 34:16.782
Humans?

34:16.908 --> 34:21.536
Who said anything about humans?

34:21.579 --> 34:23.811
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

34:23.862 --> 34:26.043
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

34:26.126 --> 34:29.757
You'll see. It's a surprise.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.884
Oh, Flounder.

34:33.969 --> 34:35.971
Flounder, you're the best!

34:36.054 --> 34:40.601
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

34:40.685 --> 34:45.732
Why, Eric, run away with you?

34:45.815 --> 34:49.527
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

34:52.949 --> 34:54.869
Daddy?

34:58.289 --> 35:02.252
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

35:02.335 --> 35:07.298
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

35:07.382 --> 35:08.884
But, Dad, I...

35:08.968 --> 35:12.221
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

35:12.304 --> 35:13.266
I had to...

35:13.349 --> 35:16.936
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

35:17.061 --> 35:19.814
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

35:19.855 --> 35:23.401
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

35:23.484 --> 35:25.737
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

35:25.821 --> 35:28.907
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

35:28.991 --> 35:31.410
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

35:31.493 --> 35:32.911
incapable of any feeling...

35:32.995 --> 35:35.916
Daddy, I love him!

35:36.000 --> 35:40.255
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

35:40.338 --> 35:42.257
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.800
I don't care.

35:43.884 --> 35:48.013
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

35:48.096 --> 35:51.975
And if this is the only way, so be it!

35:54.686 --> 35:57.523
Daddy! No!

35:57.607 --> 36:00.194
No! Please!

36:00.278 --> 36:03.990
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

36:06.701 --> 36:08.912
Daddy, no!

36:32.439 --> 36:34.399
Ariel, I...

36:34.441 --> 36:36.777
Just go away.

36:55.131 --> 37:00.721
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

37:00.805 --> 37:05.726
She has a very serious problem.

37:05.768 --> 37:09.107
If only there were
something we could do.

37:09.190 --> 37:12.111
But there is something.

37:12.194 --> 37:16.865
Who... Who are you?

37:16.949 --> 37:19.159
Don't be scared.

37:19.243 --> 37:22.454
We represent someone who can help you.

37:22.538 --> 37:27.627
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

37:27.711 --> 37:29.754
Just imagine...

37:29.796 --> 37:31.800
You and your prince...

37:31.884 --> 37:35.429
Together forever.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.431
I don't understand.

37:37.472 --> 37:43.313
Ursula has great powers.

37:43.396 --> 37:47.358
The sea witch?

37:47.442 --> 37:50.695
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

37:50.778 --> 37:53.825
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

37:53.909 --> 37:56.119
Suit yourself.

37:57.162 --> 38:00.458
It was only a suggestion.

38:10.051 --> 38:11.093
Wait.

38:11.177 --> 38:14.598
Yes?

38:14.681 --> 38:18.979
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

38:19.104 --> 38:21.878
It was an accident.

38:21.930 --> 38:24.652
Ariel? Where are you going?

38:24.693 --> 38:27.321
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

38:27.404 --> 38:29.324
I'm going to see Ursula.

38:29.366 --> 38:33.828
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.207
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

38:37.290 --> 38:42.089
But... But, I... Come on!

38:57.564 --> 38:59.233
This way.

39:17.129 --> 39:21.383
Come in. Come in, my child.

39:21.466 --> 39:26.724
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

39:26.765 --> 39:30.729
One might question
your upbringing.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.317
Now, then, you're here

39:35.400 --> 39:40.363
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

39:40.447 --> 39:46.037
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

39:46.120 --> 39:48.623
Well, angelfish,

39:48.706 --> 39:53.588
the solution to your problem is simple.

39:53.630 --> 39:55.673
The only way to get what you want

39:55.757 --> 39:57.759
is to become a human yourself.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.930
Can you do that?

40:02.514 --> 40:07.478
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

40:07.519 --> 40:09.563
It's what I live for.

40:09.647 --> 40:13.903
To help unfortunate merfolk,

41:38.750 --> 41:43.965
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

41:44.049 --> 41:46.593
Got that? Three days.

41:46.676 --> 41:49.430
Now, listen, this is important.

41:49.513 --> 41:51.891
Before the sun sets on the third day,

41:51.933 --> 41:56.395
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

41:56.437 --> 41:59.357
That is, he's got to kiss you.

41:59.440 --> 42:04.905
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

42:04.947 --> 42:08.702
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,

42:08.786 --> 42:12.748
you'll remain human permanently.

42:12.831 --> 42:16.335
But if he doesn't, you'll turn
back into a mermaid...

42:16.460 --> 42:20.507
and... you belong to me!

42:20.548 --> 42:23.385
No, Ariel!

42:23.468 --> 42:25.804
Have we got a deal?

42:25.887 --> 42:28.139
If I become human,

42:28.223 --> 42:30.978
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.

42:31.061 --> 42:33.355
That's right!

42:33.438 --> 42:36.693
But you'll have your man.

42:36.776 --> 42:42.156
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

42:44.075 --> 42:48.329
Oh! And there is one more thing.

42:48.413 --> 42:50.958
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

42:51.041 --> 42:53.087
You can't get something for nothing.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.589
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.

42:55.673 --> 42:59.844
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

42:59.927 --> 43:04.348
What I want from you is... your voice.

43:04.432 --> 43:08.562
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

43:08.645 --> 43:12.274
No more talking, singing. Zip!

43:12.357 --> 43:14.318
But without my voice, how can I...

43:14.401 --> 43:18.282
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

43:18.365 --> 43:23.413

That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

45:57.675 --> 46:01.637
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

46:20.534 --> 46:25.498
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

46:25.581 --> 46:28.209
Look at ya. Look at ya.

46:28.251 --> 46:31.546
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.

46:31.629 --> 46:34.382
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?

46:34.424 --> 46:36.509
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?

46:38.094 --> 46:40.556
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.

46:40.639 --> 46:43.602
New seashells?

46:43.644 --> 46:46.105
No new seashells.

46:46.188 --> 46:48.733
I gotta admit I can't
put my foot on it right now.

46:48.816 --> 46:50.401
If I stand here long enough...

46:50.443 --> 46:51.902
She's got legs, you idiot!

46:51.944 --> 46:56.366
She traded her voice to the sea
witch and got legs. Geez, man!

46:56.450 --> 46:57.909
I knew that.

46:57.993 --> 46:59.953
Ariel's been turned into a human.

46:59.995 --> 47:04.291
She's gotta make the prince fall in love
with her, and he's gotta kiss her.

47:04.374 --> 47:08.088
And she's only got three days!

47:08.172 --> 47:11.134
Just look at her!

47:11.176 --> 47:14.137
On legs! On human legs!

47:14.179 --> 47:18.642
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!

47:18.725 --> 47:21.686
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.

47:21.728 --> 47:24.981
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!

47:25.065 --> 47:27.985
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now

47:28.027 --> 47:30.615
and tell him just like I should
have done the minute...

47:30.698 --> 47:34.160
And don't you shake your head
at me, young lady.

47:34.243 --> 47:36.287
Maybe there's still time.

47:36.329 --> 47:39.082
If we could get that witch
to give you back your voice,

47:39.165 --> 47:42.628
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be...

47:42.711 --> 47:46.256
Just be...

47:46.340 --> 47:51.553
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

47:53.599 --> 47:56.645
All right, all right.

47:56.728 --> 48:00.774
I'll try to help ya find that prince.

48:02.901 --> 48:07.864
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

48:07.948 --> 48:09.992
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

48:10.033 --> 48:14.038
If you wanna be a human, the first thing
to do is dress like one. Let me see.

48:20.380 --> 48:24.092
Max? What?

48:24.175 --> 48:26.971
Huh? What? Max!

48:28.222 --> 48:31.517
Ya look great, kid.

48:31.600 --> 48:35.563
Ya look sensational.

48:46.118 --> 48:48.996
Max!

48:49.079 --> 48:50.581
Max!

48:50.664 --> 48:53.167
Quiet, Max.

48:53.250 --> 48:55.836
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.

48:55.919 --> 48:59.549
Oh, I see.

48:59.591 --> 49:02.721
Are you OK, miss?

49:02.763 --> 49:05.098
I'm sorry if this knucklehead
scared you.

49:05.182 --> 49:07.392
He's harmless really, uh...

49:09.394 --> 49:14.192
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

49:16.861 --> 49:18.696
We have met. I knew it.

49:18.780 --> 49:21.074
You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

49:21.115 --> 49:23.451
What's your name?

49:23.534 --> 49:27.040
What's wrong? What is it?

49:28.793 --> 49:33.422
You can't speak? Oh!

49:33.464 --> 49:36.092
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

49:40.012 --> 49:43.975
What is it? You're hurt?

49:44.059 --> 49:46.728
No, no. You need help?

49:46.812 --> 49:49.441
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.

49:50.693 --> 49:53.654
Gee, you must have
really been through something.

49:53.737 --> 49:55.864
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.

49:55.948 --> 49:57.866
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.

50:05.667 --> 50:08.503
Washed up from a shipwreck.

50:08.586 --> 50:11.717
Oh, the poor thing.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.054
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

50:17.849 --> 50:21.936
I'll just... I'll just
get this washed for you.

50:26.190 --> 50:28.484
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

50:28.526 --> 50:30.487
- No!
- Gertrude says...

50:30.529 --> 50:32.698
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

50:34.076 --> 50:36.037
- Really.
- Madam, please...

50:36.078 --> 50:39.540
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.

50:39.582 --> 50:41.667
If Eric's looking for a girl,

50:41.751 --> 50:45.213
I know a couple of highly
available ones right here.

50:57.478 --> 50:58.687
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

50:58.739 --> 50:59.897
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

50:59.980 --> 51:03.526
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people

51:03.610 --> 51:06.821
in the middle of the ocean
and then flitter off into oblivion...

51:06.905 --> 51:09.115
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.

51:09.199 --> 51:12.535
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

51:12.577 --> 51:16.874
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

51:22.423 --> 51:26.344
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?

51:26.427 --> 51:29.430
Uh, you look wonderful.

51:29.472 --> 51:34.937
Come, come, come. You must be
famished. Let me help you, my dear.

51:34.978 --> 51:37.398
There we go. That's better.

51:37.439 --> 51:41.235
Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha.

51:41.318 --> 51:46.451
It's not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

51:57.963 --> 52:02.343
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.

52:04.053 --> 52:05.974
Oh, my.

52:06.057 --> 52:07.892
Sorry, Grim.

52:07.976 --> 52:12.605
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

52:12.689 --> 52:15.275
Ah, very amusing.

52:15.316 --> 52:17.570
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?

52:17.653 --> 52:19.155
Oh, you're gonna love it!

- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just, uh...

54:52.082 --> 54:56.294
I'm sorry, madame.

54:56.378 --> 54:59.339
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy

54:59.381 --> 55:01.966
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

55:02.050 --> 55:03.968
Something in the way of a tour.

55:04.052 --> 55:07.098
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

55:07.181 --> 55:10.269
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

55:10.353 --> 55:12.522
- Do something. Have a life.
- Shh!

55:12.605 --> 55:14.524
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim, easy.

55:14.607 --> 55:17.819
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

55:17.902 --> 55:19.278
Well, what do ya say?

55:19.362 --> 55:22.449
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

55:22.533 --> 55:27.663
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

55:35.798 --> 55:37.718
Come here, boy.

55:54.944 --> 55:58.074
This has got to be, without a doubt,

55:58.158 --> 56:02.662
the single most humiliating
day of my life.

56:02.746 --> 56:08.210
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.

56:08.294 --> 56:12.339
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

56:12.423 --> 56:17.511
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.

56:17.595 --> 56:22.101
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

56:22.143 --> 56:27.441
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

56:30.277 --> 56:32.863
Hmm.

56:37.493 --> 56:42.751
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

56:42.834 --> 56:46.463
Completely hopeless.

56:54.972 --> 56:56.391
Any sign of them?

56:56.474 --> 56:59.560
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

56:59.644 --> 57:02.939
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

57:03.022 --> 57:07.278
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

57:07.320 --> 57:11.492
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

57:11.575 --> 57:13.577
Yes, sire.

57:14.829 --> 57:20.126
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

57:43.832 --> 57:45.208
Has he kissed her yet?

57:45.250 --> 57:47.711
- Not yet.
- Oh!

57:53.719 --> 57:55.722
Oh, Judy!

58:11.280 --> 58:13.910
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?

58:13.951 --> 58:16.454
No, not yet.

58:16.495 --> 58:18.956
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

58:47.656 --> 58:50.033
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

58:50.116 --> 58:51.785
I can't see a thing.

58:51.868 --> 58:55.038
Nothing is happening.

58:55.121 --> 59:00.380
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

59:00.463 --> 59:06.970
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

59:07.011 --> 59:10.056
Stand back!

59:10.139 --> 59:15.396
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

59:15.479 --> 59:20.067
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

59:20.150 --> 59:22.236
Wa, wa, wa-wa!

59:22.319 --> 59:25.324

you've got to do it yourself.

Of course, I was flying. And...

The witch was watching the mirror,

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:20.787

with a stolen set of pipes.

Day...

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:50.114
Ariel, grab onto that.

01:07:50.156 --> 01:07:53.994

I'll try!

01:07:56.121 --> 01:07:58.707
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

- You!

01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:04.296
Find a way to stall that wedding!

01:08:04.338 --> 01:08:06.298

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.094

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:02.474
Eric.

01:10:02.557 --> 01:10:04.643
You... You can talk?

01:10:04.726 --> 01:10:08.691
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

01:10:08.774 --> 01:10:12.529
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.

01:10:12.612 --> 01:10:16.741
Eric, no!

01:10:16.783 --> 01:10:19.744
You're too late!

01:10:19.786 --> 01:10:22.414
You're too late!

01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:32.427
So long, lover boy.

01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:35.221
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.

01:10:35.304 --> 01:10:38.224
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...

01:10:38.308 --> 01:10:41.602
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

01:10:41.644 --> 01:10:46.984
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:50.612
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!

01:10:50.654 --> 01:10:53.868
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...

01:10:53.951 --> 01:10:57.372
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!

01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:02.127
You see?

01:11:02.169 --> 01:11:05.505
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,

01:11:05.589 --> 01:11:07.591
even for you.

01:11:07.674 --> 01:11:13.139
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

01:11:13.181 --> 01:11:18.563
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

01:11:18.646 --> 01:11:22.817
But I might be willing
to make an exchange

01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:26.863
for someone even better.

01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:28.658
Eric, what are you doing?

01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:32.453
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!

01:11:32.536 --> 01:11:37.124
Now, do we have a deal?

01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:42.757
Ha! It's done then!

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:47.846
No! Oh, no!

01:11:56.397 --> 01:11:58.524
Your Majesty.

01:11:58.565 --> 01:11:59.859
Daddy.

01:11:59.901 --> 01:12:04.408
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

01:12:06.618 --> 01:12:10.872
You!

01:12:10.956 --> 01:12:12.165
You monster!

01:12:12.249 --> 01:12:14.419
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.422
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!

01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:20.049
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

01:12:20.133 --> 01:12:22.093
After him!

01:12:28.685 --> 01:12:31.605
Come on!

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:34.400
Ow!

01:12:35.901 --> 01:12:39.196
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

01:12:43.951 --> 01:12:48.667
Babies! My poor little poopsies.

01:12:58.677 --> 01:13:01.431
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.

01:13:01.514 --> 01:13:03.767
No, I won't leave you.

01:13:21.329 --> 01:13:26.209
You pitiful, insignificant fools!

01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:28.252
Look out!

01:13:30.004 --> 01:13:32.966
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:36.639
The waves obey my every whim!

01:13:36.722 --> 01:13:40.810
Eric!

01:13:40.893 --> 01:13:46.608
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.924
Eric!

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:32.453
Oh! Oh!

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.009
So much for true love!

01:15:42.491 --> 01:15:46.537
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:52.502
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty,

01:15:52.585 --> 01:15:57.551
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

01:15:57.634 --> 01:15:59.553
You always say that?

01:16:02.472 --> 01:16:06.769
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:08.980
And what's that, Your Majesty?

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:12.650
How much I'm going to miss her.

01:17:11.552 --> 01:17:13.930
Ah-ha!

01:17:21.605 --> 01:17:25.694
Yes!

01:17:25.778 --> 01:17:27.655
Thank you. Thank you.

01:17:37.624 --> 01:17:39.251
I love you, Daddy.
