00:04.210 --> 00:05.120
Bex:
 Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.120 --> 00:06.580
I need to talk to you.

00:06.580 --> 00:07.750
-Okay.
-Andi--

00:07.750 --> 00:09.750
-Andi!
-Who's that?

00:09.750 --> 00:12.210
It doesn't matter.
What were you gonna say?

00:12.210 --> 00:13.250
I'll tell you later.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.540
Look at you guys.
Here, together.

00:15.540 --> 00:18.380
We're getting a birthday present
for Amber.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.250
You remember her,
right, Bex?

00:20.250 --> 00:23.750
Jonah's girlfriend
who's still his... girlfriend.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.790
See how this
makes her eyes sparkle?

00:25.790 --> 00:28.210
Wow. You look
really pretty.

00:28.210 --> 00:29.420
Thanks.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.420
That one likes you even if
he doesn't know it yet.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.620
You don't know that.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.120
You'll see.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.580
Thanks, Andi.
You're a great... pal.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.540
Guys, I need a face
for picture day.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.250
-Too easy.
-(Andi laughs)

00:48.250 --> 00:49.920
Listen, this is important.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.420
In grade school,
I went with the classic,

00:52.420 --> 00:53.580
"Please love me."

00:53.580 --> 00:56.330
But this is middle school.
I want to branch out.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.580
Show some moxie.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.420
Which one of these
do you like better?

01:00.500 --> 01:02.250
"Young Ben Affleck"?

01:03.670 --> 01:06.210
Or...

01:06.210 --> 01:08.420
"Future yogurt millionaire."

01:08.420 --> 01:11.330
You do know
picture day's a racket?

01:11.330 --> 01:14.880
Picture day
is a sacred institution.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.040
You can get an eight by 10
picture of yourself

01:17.040 --> 01:20.380
from any photo lab in the
country, for two dollars.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.080
It's not just any
eight by 10 picture of me.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.380
It's an eight by 10 picture of
me perched awkwardly on a stool,

01:27.380 --> 01:29.790
in front
of a blue backdrop.

01:30.830 --> 01:33.120
Ease up.
I think you hit a vein.

01:37.380 --> 01:39.880
Excuse me. Just wanted
to introduce myself.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.460
I'm the new principal,
Dr. Metcalf.

01:42.460 --> 01:45.420
Nice to meet you.
Andi, Cyrus, Buffy.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.920
I want you to know, I'm not a scary
principal, I'm an approachable one.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.330
I don't see any reason
why we can't be friends.

01:51.330 --> 01:54.380
(sniffs)
Well, I do see one reason.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.790
-Me?
-Your attire.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.790
Specifically, your leggings.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.540
When was the last time you read the
Jefferson Middle School dress code?

02:04.540 --> 02:06.460
I didn't know there was one.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.330
Of course there's a dress code.
You're here to learn,

02:09.330 --> 02:11.920
not distract each other
with your body parts.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.750
Who am I distracting?

02:14.750 --> 02:16.540
Because that would be a first.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.620
I want you to know,
I have a sense of humor,

02:18.620 --> 02:21.540
but I'm choosing
not to exercise it right now.

02:21.540 --> 02:24.380
I hear if you don't
exercise a sense of humor,

02:24.380 --> 02:26.540
it loses muscle tone.

02:26.540 --> 02:27.540
(laughing)

02:29.960 --> 02:31.290
Nothing?

02:31.290 --> 02:33.250
Tough crowd.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.420
This went south very fast.

02:35.420 --> 02:38.790
I will be distributing a copy of
the dress code to every student.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.830
You can plead ignorance
today but not tomorrow.

02:41.830 --> 02:44.120
Which is picture day!
Don't forget!

02:44.120 --> 02:46.420
No chance of that!

02:46.420 --> 02:50.210
Sorry, that was an involuntary
response to the words "picture day."

Why would anyone
ban oversized clothing?

04:03.580 --> 04:05.620
Is he against being cozy?

04:05.620 --> 04:07.750
So what are you gonna
do about it?

04:07.750 --> 04:10.750
Do? It's the dress code.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.830
It's a code. It's a school law!

04:14.830 --> 04:17.750
That's been in effect
since... February.

04:17.750 --> 04:21.209
It's not like he can monitor
what every student's wearing.

04:21.209 --> 04:23.830
He's definitely gonna
be monitoring Andi.

04:23.830 --> 04:27.290
And it's so unfair.
You're not a troublemaker.

04:27.290 --> 04:28.960
Maybe you should be.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.330
Cyrus:
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.790
You do not want to run
with the troublemakers.

04:32.790 --> 04:34.670
They're like coyotes.
They're mean,

04:34.670 --> 04:37.460
and they hunt in packs,
and they're night feeders!

04:37.460 --> 04:39.880
How's middle school
going for you, Cyrus?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.250
Bit of a roller coaster.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.380
Okay, well, there are
other kinds of troublemakers.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.580
Like the ones who don't
let somebody tell you

04:45.580 --> 04:47.620
what you can
and cannot wear.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.170
Does any of this
seem fair to you?

04:50.170 --> 04:52.170
-No.
-It's not fair.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.000
It's like we're in prison.

So... I gather you're not
happy with the dress code.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.960
Up until yesterday, we
didn't even know we had one.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.290
And everything
worked just fine.

05:52.290 --> 05:53.830
Did it?

05:53.830 --> 05:56.000
Then why am I here?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.750
Why does Jefferson Middle School
suddenly have a new principal?

06:03.380 --> 06:04.790
We give up!

06:04.790 --> 06:06.120
Your grade point averages.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.500
Your test scores.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.330
Your numbers are falling!

06:09.330 --> 06:13.540
This used to be the third-ranked
middle school in the city.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.040
Now it's 10th.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.330
Out of how many schools?

06:17.330 --> 06:19.000
A hundred and sixty-two.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.250
So that's what,
a 4.3 percent drop?

06:22.250 --> 06:25.330
Her test scores
are still very high,

06:25.330 --> 06:27.670
but her socks
may be too colorful.

06:27.670 --> 06:28.750
Oh!

06:28.750 --> 06:30.460
Oh!

06:31.500 --> 06:34.380
Still not exercising
that sense of humor, I see.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.000
We understand that there needs
to be a dress code.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.420
All we're asking
is that it's reasonable.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.330
Is that too much to ask?

06:42.920 --> 06:46.790
No, really, I'm asking.
This is my first protest.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.250
No, you're doing great.

06:49.620 --> 06:52.290
But this prison garb
is against dress code.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.420
-Since when?
-Since just now!

06:54.420 --> 06:57.460
-You can't do that!
-Oh, but I can.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.830
It's in another pamphlet
called, "Oh, But I Can!"

07:00.830 --> 07:02.330
(laughs)

07:03.420 --> 07:05.620
Consider my sense
of humor exercised.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.000
I liked it better
before he was funny.

07:11.540 --> 07:17.330
And now... you can either
go home and change,

07:17.330 --> 07:19.330
or just stay home,
until you decide

07:19.330 --> 07:22.420
that your education is more
important than your wardrobe.

07:22.420 --> 07:27.290
You'd suspend us just
for what we're wearing?

07:27.290 --> 07:30.540
Guys, come on. You've had your
fun, now let me do my job.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.330
I'm your principal,
not your prison warden.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.330
Students (chanting): Freedom of dress!
Freedom of dress!

07:37.330 --> 07:40.880
Freedom of dress!
Freedom of dress!

07:40.880 --> 07:44.500
X-X-L!
X-X-L!

07:44.500 --> 07:48.080

Freedom of dress!
Freedom of dress!

08:06.000 --> 08:08.580
-Andi: What do we want?
-Students: Leggings!

08:08.580 --> 08:10.080
When do we want them?

08:10.080 --> 08:11.380
Students:
Now!

08:11.380 --> 08:13.420
And extra large sweatshirts!

08:13.420 --> 08:15.250
X-X-L!

08:15.250 --> 08:18.620
Students: X-X-L! X-X-L!

08:18.620 --> 08:21.670
X-X-L!
X-X-L!

08:21.670 --> 08:26.380
So, are you gonna suspend
all of these kids?

08:26.380 --> 08:30.170
Ooh, that's not gonna help this
school's academic standing.

08:33.289 --> 08:36.750
This is hilarious!
You know what's going on?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.960
Yeah, we're protesting
the dress code.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.039
Why?

08:41.039 --> 08:43.330
Because I wore leggings
to school yesterday,

08:43.330 --> 08:45.040
and I got in trouble for it.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.540
Can you believe that?

08:46.540 --> 08:47.790
Huh?

08:47.790 --> 08:51.420
I mean, the dress code's
totally unfair.

08:51.420 --> 08:55.420
They have all these random
restrictions, especially for girls.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.460
Oh.

08:56.460 --> 09:00.290
So it's like
we're in prison.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.420
Oh, I get it.
Like a metaphor.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.790
Exactly!

09:03.790 --> 09:06.960
So now we have this protest
that I'm the leader of.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.460
Do you wanna join us?

09:08.460 --> 09:11.380
I could totally get you
a uniform.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.830
Nah, I'm-- I'm good.

09:13.830 --> 09:15.790
Oh.

09:15.790 --> 09:18.290
-Okay.
-Hey, don't forget.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.710
Space Otters team picture's
this afternoon.

09:20.710 --> 09:23.290
First one ever, it's gonna
be in the yearbook.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.830
Exciting.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.750
You'll be there, right?

09:28.330 --> 09:32.420
Definitely. Yeah. If I can,
there's just a lot going on.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.080
No, listen,
you have to be there.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.330
This is important to me.

09:35.330 --> 09:37.790
I want the whole team
to be in this picture.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.750
Then I'll be there.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.920
You rock, Andiman.
You never let me down.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.210
Is he gonna
put on a uniform?

09:47.210 --> 09:49.120
Nah, he's good.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.670
He'd be better
if he put on a uniform.

09:54.580 --> 09:56.500
Bex:
My principle, okay?

09:56.500 --> 09:59.580
Yeah, that's right, it's
your body, your clothes,

09:59.580 --> 10:00.880
your style.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.880
There you go. Thank you

Oh!

10:09.500 --> 10:11.380
Thank you

10:11.380 --> 10:14.330
Leave the premises immediately
or I will call the police.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.380
No need.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.120
I'll go.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.580
And I'm confiscating

with the rest of your class

10:50.580 --> 10:52.750
know who that woman is?

10:54.670 --> 10:57.380
Yeah... I know who she is.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.500
So, do you wanna
change first or should I?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.330
What do you mean, change?

11:08.330 --> 11:10.330
Into our picture day clothes?

11:10.330 --> 11:11.420
These are
our picture day clothes.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.040
(laughs) No. I have a cobalt
blue Italian linen shirt

11:15.040 --> 11:18.880
and a satin batwing bowtie from the
Diamonds Are Forever James Bond collection

11:18.880 --> 11:21.170
in a garment bag
in the teachers' lounge.

11:21.170 --> 11:23.420
Save my place.
I'll be right back.

11:23.420 --> 11:25.500
-Cyrus.
-Buffy?

11:25.500 --> 11:28.080
The whole point of this protest
is to show that we're not free

11:28.080 --> 11:29.460
to wear
what we want.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.750
But it's picture day.
Please.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.920
The James Bond
collection?

11:35.380 --> 11:37.000
(mutters)
Nobody has to know.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.500
Cyrus, we're the leaders
of this movement.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.040
We have to be strong.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.330
But I'm not strong.
I'm weak!

11:44.500 --> 11:46.380
This line is moving so fast.

11:46.380 --> 11:48.330
It'll be fine!

11:48.330 --> 11:50.210
You'll be a hero!

11:50.210 --> 11:53.460
Not to my parents, who need
this picture for their mantles

11:53.460 --> 11:56.620
to reassure themselves that they didn't
damage me in their bitter divorce.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.000
I told you I would be.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.290
I want you up front.

13:29.290 --> 13:30.500
Are we ready?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.290
Uh, one second.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.500
You got your jersey
under that, right?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.380
Where's your jersey?

13:37.380 --> 13:39.290
In my locker.

13:39.290 --> 13:40.420
You have to wear it.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.330
Go get it.

13:42.330 --> 13:44.330
No, I'm good.

13:44.330 --> 13:48.460
Listen, I've got other teams
to photograph. Real ones.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.080
I hate it
when they say that.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.380
I know you do.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.790
We are a real team.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.380
We play a real sport.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.750
This is why I need you
to wear your jersey

13:58.750 --> 14:00.250
so they take us seriously.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.210
It's important.

14:02.210 --> 14:06.960
To you. Wearing this
is important to me.

14:06.960 --> 14:11.330
I'm just asking you to wear the Space
Otters jersey for five seconds.

14:11.330 --> 14:13.620
Please.
For me?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.210
-Okay.
-Yes!

14:15.210 --> 14:18.210
I'll wear the Space Otters
jersey for the picture

14:18.210 --> 14:20.880
if you can tell me why I'm
wearing a prison uniform.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.080
We talked about it earlier.

14:28.420 --> 14:31.000
I explained
why it was important to me.

14:33.580 --> 14:37.000
Yeah...
that's what I thought.

14:59.170 --> 15:00.420
Are you okay?

15:00.420 --> 15:04.330
No, I'm not okay. We did the
protests, nothing changed,

15:04.330 --> 15:08.460
and now we've both been called
to the principal's office.

15:08.460 --> 15:09.500
This is bad!

15:09.500 --> 15:11.330
What's the worst
that could happen?

15:11.330 --> 15:13.830
I could get suspended.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.790
That goes
on my permanent record!

15:17.790 --> 15:20.040
-Forever!
-Little secret.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.620
There is no permanent record.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.120
What?

15:24.120 --> 15:26.540
Yep. They made it up
to scare kids.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.330
Well, it worked.

15:28.330 --> 15:31.290
There's also no boogyman and your
face will not stay that way.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.880
I'm glad you could make it.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.750
I don't know
if you remember me.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.420
We met in the parking lot.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.210
I'm the new principal,
Dr. Metcalf.

15:40.210 --> 15:44.000
And I... (laughs) have been looking
through your permanent record.

15:46.540 --> 15:49.000
-May I see it?
-No.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.460
And yours...
had been empty.

15:51.460 --> 15:53.710
Until today.

15:53.710 --> 15:57.290
Aw, it's like my permanent
record had a baby.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.670
Dr. Metcalf,

16:02.670 --> 16:04.960
I just wanna be able
to wear my clothes.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.580
The same clothes
I wear every day.

16:07.580 --> 16:11.750
And my fellow students
have still, somehow,

16:11.750 --> 16:13.880
been able
to get an education.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.170
And I just wanna be a principal

16:15.170 --> 16:17.540
who has the respect
of his students.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.670
It's only day two
and clearly, I don't.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.670
I do respect you.

16:22.670 --> 16:25.920
But I would
respect you a lot more

16:25.920 --> 16:29.210
if we could maybe talk about
adjusting the dress code?

16:30.920 --> 16:34.790
I could... maybe talk about
adjusting the dress code

16:34.790 --> 16:36.750
if...

16:36.750 --> 16:40.710
you and your friends agree to never
wear prison uniforms again, and you...

16:40.710 --> 16:42.830
agree never
to pass them out again.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.120
Andi?

16:45.120 --> 16:46.880
I can live
with those terms.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.420
So can I.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.750
Shall we shake on it?

16:50.750 --> 16:54.290
Is... that right?
Is that how you end a protest?

16:54.290 --> 16:57.170
I don't know, this is
the first time I've ever won.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.960
You're the kind of kid that
made me want to be a principal.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.420
Ha-ha! I knew it!
It's all Sudoku!

17:06.420 --> 17:09.380
(chuckling)
In your face!

17:09.380 --> 17:11.829
And you're the kind of kid that made
me want to be a dentist. Get out.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.920
-Okay.
-Go, go, go, go, go...

17:17.420 --> 17:19.079
What should we toast?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.500
Troublemaking.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.380
All:
To troublemaking!

17:24.500 --> 17:27.579
I love today!
All these great things happened,

17:27.579 --> 17:30.120
and we're all sitting here,
and we're all happy.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.500
I mean, how many days like
that do you get in a lifetime?

17:32.500 --> 17:36.290
Not many, I can tell you, from
reading my parents' patient files.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.080
Oh, hey, more good news!

17:38.080 --> 17:39.500
-Tell me, tell me!
-The school's bringing back

17:39.500 --> 17:42.080
the photographer tomorrow
to redo picture day.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.120
You'll get to wear your James
Bond bowtie after all.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.460
But what about the
pictures they took today?

17:47.460 --> 17:50.290
-They're scrapping those.
-No, they can't!

17:50.290 --> 17:52.790
My facial choices
were on fire!

17:53.830 --> 17:56.120
I could take some pictures now,
get them printed,

17:56.120 --> 17:58.620
and you could have your eight-by-tens
by the end of the week.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.210
And I'm gonna need
some wallet-sized.

18:04.330 --> 18:06.420
(tapping on window)

18:09.790 --> 18:12.250
I bet he wants
to apologize.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.420
Then I guess
I should let him.

18:23.460 --> 18:24.920
Hey!

18:24.920 --> 18:26.540
Could we walk a little?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.250
Please.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.540
I wanted to say
congratulations.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.620
I heard they're
changing the dress code.

18:34.620 --> 18:38.000
Thanks. It feels really
good to do something.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.380
Except, now I have to get rid
of 40 prison uniforms.

18:42.380 --> 18:45.000
I feel really bad
I wasn't a part of it.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
I was only thinking
about Frisbee. As usual.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.670
That's okay.
We had plenty of people.

18:52.710 --> 18:53.960
I don't know if you heard,

18:53.960 --> 18:56.500
but the photographers
are comin' back tomorrow.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.960
I heard.

18:57.960 --> 19:01.040
They're going to retake the team
picture, and I want you to be there.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.250
And you can wear
whatever you want.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.420
Thanks, that's really nice.

19:06.750 --> 19:10.380
But... I don't wanna
be in the picture.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.580
So you're still mad at me.

19:13.580 --> 19:17.460
No. I'm not mad at you,
I swear.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.290
I don't wanna
be in the picture...

19:20.670 --> 19:22.710
because I don't
wanna be on the team.

19:23.790 --> 19:28.170
Stop. You can't
quit the team.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.960
You're Andiman.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.830
You love Frisbee!

19:33.830 --> 19:37.790
No... you love Frisbee.

19:37.790 --> 19:40.170
I like it.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.670
But, really, the only reason
why I joined the team

19:42.670 --> 19:45.750
was because you asked me to.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.460
Well, then I'm asking you
not to quit.

19:49.290 --> 19:50.380
See, that's the thing.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.500
You think I'll do
whatever you want,

19:52.500 --> 19:56.000
which makes perfect sense
because that is what I do.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.710
No, it isn't!

19:58.710 --> 20:01.620
Yes, it is,
think about it.

20:01.620 --> 20:05.830
I joined the team, I helped you get a
birthday present for your girlfriend,

20:05.830 --> 20:11.750
who is never nice to me. I made you
a bracelet, that you gave her.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.330
I'm sorry about that.

20:13.330 --> 20:16.290
It's fine.
I don't care about Amber.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.500
I-- I don't care
about the bracelet.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.540
I don't care
about any of it.

20:22.920 --> 20:27.500
I just want you to stop asking
me to do things for you.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.420
I will.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.290
I'm sorry.

20:30.290 --> 20:33.170
Stop apologizing,
you didn't do anything wrong.

20:33.170 --> 20:34.420
I did!

20:35.460 --> 20:37.960
I never stood up
for myself until today.

20:39.210 --> 20:43.380
But I want to again tomorrow,
and the day after that.

20:45.540 --> 20:49.120
But being around you
makes it really hard.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.710
What are you saying?

20:51.710 --> 20:54.080
We're still friends, right?

20:55.460 --> 20:57.670
Jonah, be honest...

20:59.880 --> 21:01.540
were we ever?

21:19.420 --> 21:20.580
Jonah:
 Next, on Andi Mack...

21:20.580 --> 21:24.290
A Jonah-free lifestyle
is way less complicated.

21:24.290 --> 21:25.540
Do you know what's going on
with Andi?

21:25.540 --> 21:29.080
I wouldn't call it mad,
more coolly detached.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.380
You like her, don't you?

21:30.380 --> 21:31.880
I gotta go.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.290
Buffy:
 If we race, and I beat you,

21:34.290 --> 21:35.830
will you still talk to me?

21:35.830 --> 21:38.790
If I beat you, will you still
talk to me?

21:38.790 --> 21:41.170
You're breaking up with me?

21:41.170 --> 21:42.460
How dare you!

21:42.460 --> 21:43.500
You're in middle school,

21:43.500 --> 21:46.380
do you know how lucky you are
to be dating me?
