00:01.682 --> 00:02.497
How's the baby?

00:02.632 --> 00:05.259
You can stop competing for
the father of the year award.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.567
She's giving the kid up for adoption.

00:06.601 --> 00:08.302
It's called Meniere's disease.

<i>I've lost 60% of the
hearing in my right ear.</i>

It's hard to explain.

00:15.378 --> 00:16.788

00:16.981 --> 00:19.259
And your boyfriend looked like he
wanted to see a little less of me too.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.811
Emmett's not my boyfriend.

00:20.845 --> 00:24.579
We're having another one of these
next week if you wanna swing by.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.714
- Christian rock?
- Issues with the big man?

00:26.747 --> 00:29.347
<i>No, just questions.</i>

00:29.381 --> 00:31.414
Daphne: Here's to being switched at birth,

00:31.448 --> 00:34.279
and getting a food truck to
compensate for the damages.

00:34.313 --> 00:36.547
Hey, you're too young to be
setting up shop by yourself.

00:36.581 --> 00:40.150
I won't be alone. I'm going with Travis.

00:40.185 --> 00:42.020
- Those tacos were good.
- Thanks.

00:43.289 --> 00:46.857

already went to school.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.332
Is that a bruise on...

01:06.367 --> 01:09.535
Uh, I just fell off my bike.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.469
It looks really bad.

01:11.504 --> 01:14.173
No, it just looks worse than it is.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.240
You sure?

01:15.275 --> 01:17.309
Yeah. What are those?

01:17.343 --> 01:19.177
Oh. (Chuckles)

01:19.212 --> 01:21.814
I was cleaning out my closet
for the consignment shop

01:21.848 --> 01:23.148
and I found all these sweaters.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.183
I thought maybe you'd like them.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.719
Wow! They're so pretty!

01:27.754 --> 01:29.888
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

01:33.025 --> 01:36.561
I thought your bicycle chain was broken.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.731
Oh, uh, nope. I fixed it.

01:39.765 --> 01:42.667
Oh. Well, have a good day.

01:50.142 --> 01:52.977
Buy a rose for the Drama Club.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.247
Matthew. Hey. Buy a rose.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.816
Show her how much you care.

02:01.119 --> 02:02.886
Mmm.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.988
The Drama Club thanks you two lovers.

02:07.090 --> 02:09.792
Huh. Guilt is so romantic.

02:09.826 --> 02:12.895

I'm just gonna lay low this year.

Just let it be another day. (Sighs)

(Chuckles)

05:42.296 --> 05:44.163
I guess at some point

05:44.197 --> 05:47.099
we could do something
different for Valentine's Day.

05:47.134 --> 05:49.235
- Are we boring?
- Sweetie,

05:49.269 --> 05:52.305
I love our tradition. I
live for this tradition.

05:52.339 --> 05:54.173
Well, that's kinda sad.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.242
Is it? Or is it...

(Softly) incredibly romantic?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.281

- Cheesecake too?

06:01.315 --> 06:02.983
There will be cheesecake.

06:03.018 --> 06:04.285
Yes! Consider me seduced.

06:04.319 --> 06:06.253
You will not see me till
8:00 P.M. this evening.

06:06.288 --> 06:08.122
I have dinner with prospective donors,

06:08.156 --> 06:10.257
but tomorrow night is
completely campaign free

06:10.292 --> 06:12.059
and I expect...

06:12.093 --> 06:13.127
Sweetie?

06:14.196 --> 06:16.229
Oh! I'm sorry.

06:16.264 --> 06:19.199
I was just checking to see
if Daphne texted me back.

06:19.234 --> 06:22.970
- Something wrong?
- Well, she had this big bruise on her side

06:23.004 --> 06:24.972
and she said it's 'cause
she fell off her bike,

06:25.006 --> 06:27.141
but her bike is broken.
I checked in the garage.

06:27.175 --> 06:30.077
Well, maybe she broke her
bike again, hence the bruise.

06:30.111 --> 06:32.079
I don't know. I think she's lying.

06:32.114 --> 06:33.981
That's why I'm worried.

06:34.016 --> 06:37.352
Hmm. Do you remember when
we were skiing in park city,

06:37.386 --> 06:40.955
and I decided that I could
take the advanced slope?

06:40.989 --> 06:43.057
And you sprained both of your knees?

06:43.091 --> 06:44.959
That is correct. I can sometimes be

06:44.993 --> 06:46.227
a delightful combination

06:46.261 --> 06:48.363
of daring and clumsy.

06:48.397 --> 06:50.265
And Daphne is my daughter,

06:50.299 --> 06:53.001
so I'm sure that she's fine.

06:53.035 --> 06:56.271
And I will see you tonight

06:56.305 --> 06:59.307
and I am loving the apron.

07:11.955 --> 07:14.123
- 'Sup, buddy?
- And what are you supposed to be?

07:14.158 --> 07:16.993
Some sort of Cupid. Just be
glad I'm not wearing a diaper.

07:17.027 --> 07:20.230
Yet another reason I think
Valentine's Day is so stupid...

07:20.264 --> 07:23.366
it revolves around a
deranged baby with a weapon.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.035
Such a waste of money and glitter.

07:26.069 --> 07:28.137
Oh, I didn't realize you
were so fond of glitter.

07:28.172 --> 07:30.139
Last year I spent three weeks engraving

07:30.174 --> 07:32.909
a leather banjo strap with
my girlfriend's initials

07:32.943 --> 07:35.178
and sunflowers on it. As
I'm driving up to her house,

07:35.212 --> 07:38.982
I get a text that says, "sorry, but
I'm just not feeling it anymore."

07:39.016 --> 07:40.384
Sometimes I really hate phones.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.287
Yeah well, now I just
put my angst into acting.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.990
Wait, you're doing the play too?

07:47.025 --> 07:49.159
Mm-hmm. I saw you were doing it,

07:49.193 --> 07:52.129
so I thought, um...

07:52.163 --> 07:53.997
and now I'm Romeo.

07:54.032 --> 07:55.933
What? Wherefore art thou, dude?

07:55.967 --> 07:57.001
I know. It's crazy.

07:57.035 --> 07:59.070
I think there were four hearing guys

07:59.104 --> 08:00.271
and five speaking parts.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.873
So they were a little desperate, obviously.

08:02.908 --> 08:05.175
Don't forget me when you're
the next James Franco.

08:05.210 --> 08:08.212
You know, February 14th
is Oregon's birthday.

08:08.246 --> 08:11.015
- Little known fact.
- How wrong you are.

08:11.049 --> 08:13.217
I make it a point to know
every state's birthday.

08:13.251 --> 08:15.352
- Mm-hmm.
- I just never know what to get them.

08:15.387 --> 08:20.024
I'll probably just stay in
and watch "Game of Thrones."

08:20.058 --> 08:22.026
Nothing says Valentine's Day

08:22.060 --> 08:24.929
like some gnarly decapitations.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.297

- It's really no big deal.
- What, a Valentine's Day gift?

11:05.224 --> 11:09.127
It's more of a three-month
anniversary type thing.

11:09.162 --> 11:11.997
It was three months ago from
yesterday that we first...

11:12.031 --> 11:14.066
- This is...
- ... Played together, so...

11:14.100 --> 11:15.967
It's totally sappy, I know.

11:16.002 --> 11:18.236
No no, it's the sweetest gift

11:18.271 --> 11:20.072
I've ever gotten. Thank you.

11:20.106 --> 11:23.008
I kept it... not to be creepy or anything,

11:23.042 --> 11:24.109
- but to...
- I love you.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.968

- They look nice.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.303
They raise golden retrievers
and they have a lake house.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.138
Okay, I don't wanna see
any more until I've...

11:55.172 --> 11:58.174
and this one is in Denver.
They've tried surrogates,

11:58.209 --> 12:00.377
- fertility treatments, Russian orphans.
- Lana, stop.

They've been trying to
have a family for 10 years,

12:10.389 --> 12:12.056
Fine.

12:13.226 --> 12:15.394
I can't raise this kid.

about you, neither can you.

12:37.384 --> 12:39.385
watch this version of "Romeo and Juliet"

12:39.419 --> 12:42.155
with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes

12:42.189 --> 12:44.123

There's a whole lot of cow in here.

How did it go today?

12:51.299 --> 12:54.100
Well, let's just say unless you're five,

12:54.134 --> 12:56.903
wearing a costume to
school is never a good idea.

12:56.937 --> 12:59.906
Also learned... olympic archery
officially off the table.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.073
Hmm.

13:02.109 --> 13:04.677
Gotcha! (Laughs)

13:04.711 --> 13:06.779
(Inhales deeply) Now
you're gonna fall in love

13:06.814 --> 13:09.882
- with the first person you see.
- Can that person be Greek yogurt?

13:09.916 --> 13:12.718
'Cause that's all that's
happening right now.

13:12.753 --> 13:15.555
- What's going on with Emmett?
- (Sighs)

13:15.589 --> 13:18.358
<i>- (Spoon clatters)
- I told him I just wanna be friends.</i>

13:18.392 --> 13:22.262
And he said he couldn't, because
being just friends is too hard.

13:22.297 --> 13:23.497
Oh...

13:23.531 --> 13:25.332
And then there's this other guy,

13:25.366 --> 13:28.402
but he's made it clear that he'd
pretty much rather do anything

13:28.436 --> 13:30.904
instead of hang out with me. (Sighs)

13:30.939 --> 13:32.873
I'm sure that's not true, honey.

13:34.108 --> 13:36.009
What's incredible is

13:36.043 --> 13:39.112
I actually used to
really like this holiday.

13:40.882 --> 13:42.850
Why don't you have some friends over here?

13:42.885 --> 13:43.985
I don't think so.

13:45.554 --> 13:47.689
No, we can make
chocolate-covered strawberries

13:47.723 --> 13:49.790
and count the little candies in the jar,

13:49.825 --> 13:52.426
pin the wing on the cherub.

13:52.461 --> 13:55.329
Mom, let's put the kibosh
on this. I'm meeting Angelo.

13:56.532 --> 13:59.266
Wait. You're talking with Angelo again?

13:59.300 --> 14:02.469
Sort of. I don't know. I gotta go.

14:07.209 --> 14:09.109
<i>(Traffic sounds)</i>

14:14.983 --> 14:16.884

14:31.465 --> 14:34.366
Hey, do you guys do burritos or...

14:34.401 --> 14:37.503
- are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm sorry,

14:37.538 --> 14:39.371
we're closed for the evening.

14:42.976 --> 14:44.910

16:22.804 --> 16:24.638
Me too.

16:27.609 --> 16:29.544
So what's happening with Lana?

16:29.578 --> 16:32.180
Is she putting the baby
up for adoption still?

16:32.214 --> 16:34.282
(Sighs) Every time we try to talk about it,

16:34.316 --> 16:36.183
all we manage to do is fight.

16:36.218 --> 16:39.186
Well, you guys should
stop talking about it.

16:39.221 --> 16:43.090
Just hang out, try to get
to know each other again.

16:43.124 --> 16:45.058
So what about you?

16:45.093 --> 16:47.161
Any plans for Valentine's?

16:47.195 --> 16:50.630
(Laughs) My mom suggested
I have some people over,

16:50.665 --> 16:52.799
which isn't the worst idea in the world.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.636
But if we do it at my house,
then she's gonna be matchmaking

16:55.670 --> 16:57.604
and trying to get everybody
to decorate cookies

16:57.639 --> 16:59.473
and I'm trying to make
friends at this point,

16:59.507 --> 17:01.375
- not traumatize them.
- (Chuckles)

17:01.410 --> 17:03.577
Well, you could do it at my place.

17:03.611 --> 17:05.479
Are we talking, like, unsupervised?

17:06.513 --> 17:08.582
Kidding! Trick question. You passed.

17:08.616 --> 17:10.349
I will be there chaperoning,

17:10.385 --> 17:12.185
but you'll barely know I was there.

17:14.088 --> 17:16.122
Your apartment is pretty sweet.

17:16.156 --> 17:18.125
Please, it will be my pleasure.

17:19.327 --> 17:21.228
<i>(Police radio chatter)</i>

17:25.232 --> 17:28.134
(Breathes heavily) Are you okay?

17:28.169 --> 17:30.970
I'm fine. They just got
some money. That's it.

17:31.004 --> 17:33.706
- (Sighs)
- It's really not that big a deal.

17:36.676 --> 17:37.843
Thank you so much.

17:37.844 --> 17:39.686
_

17:45.638 --> 17:47.129
_

17:47.421 --> 17:49.555
Okay, Miss Vasquez. If you
could follow me this way.

17:57.164 --> 17:59.231
<i>Daphne: When my friend
was taking the trash out,</i>

17:59.266 --> 18:01.233
the guy who first came up
to the counter came back.

18:01.268 --> 18:03.803
So he was about six feet, dark brown hair?

18:03.837 --> 18:05.705
Yes.

18:05.739 --> 18:07.607
Does she need a signing person?

18:07.641 --> 18:09.608
I mean, I think we're
supposed to provide one.

18:09.643 --> 18:10.876
No. I'm fine.

18:10.910 --> 18:13.445
Okay, any distinguishing characteristics?

18:13.480 --> 18:14.813
Facial hair, scars, moles?

18:14.848 --> 18:18.317
I don't think so. He came
up to order more tacos.

18:18.351 --> 18:20.619
And when I turned around, the
second guy was taking the cash box,

18:20.653 --> 18:24.323
- and so I tried to grab it back from him...
- Wait.

18:24.357 --> 18:27.126
- ... and he pushed...
- You tried to grab it back?

18:28.195 --> 18:30.129
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.

18:30.163 --> 18:32.065
I wasn't thinking straight.

18:32.099 --> 18:34.868
Daphne, do not ever fight over money.

18:34.902 --> 18:37.104
I know. I... I'm sorry.

18:37.138 --> 18:38.973
I have a question...
what were two deaf kids

18:39.007 --> 18:40.842
doing out at night by themselves anyway?

18:40.876 --> 18:41.617
What should they do?

18:41.618 --> 18:43.718
Sit inside a locked house
for the rest of their lives?

18:43.719 --> 18:46.482
I don't know. It just
sounds pretty unsafe to me.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.551
- What's your name?
- Mom, please.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.453
I want your name and your badge number.

18:50.487 --> 18:52.555
- I want to speak to your supervisor.
- Mom, stop.

18:52.590 --> 18:56.259
- I don't even care.
- I care how he talks to you.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.751
If you just let me talk,
we'll all be out of here soon.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.841
<i>I just found out last night. </i>

19:27.875 --> 19:29.676
Why didn't you call us
the minute you found out?

19:29.711 --> 19:31.878
- I don't know. I didn't think of it.
- You didn't think of it?

19:31.912 --> 19:33.747
- We're her parents.
- I'm her parent.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.782
- Wait a second, so are we.
- We're her parents too.

19:35.816 --> 19:38.518
And did you get her to a doctor?
Somebody has to look at that bruise.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.520
- Where is she right now?
- School, and yes, I made an appointment.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.256
Did they dust for fingerprints?
Do you have any idea who did this?

19:44.290 --> 19:46.091
Who took care of you down at the precinct?

19:46.126 --> 19:47.393
I don't remember, but
I have it written down.

19:47.427 --> 19:49.361
Regina, you should've called
me. I know people down there.

19:49.395 --> 19:52.330
I have to go. If I hear
something, I will let you know.

19:54.968 --> 19:57.169
<i>- (Door closes)
- After all we've done for her,</i>

19:57.203 --> 19:59.771
I cannot believe she's
treating us like this.

19:59.806 --> 20:02.874
I'll tell you one thing... Daphne
is never taking that truck out again.

20:02.909 --> 20:04.709
We're her parents too. I mean...

20:04.744 --> 20:06.945
Oh my God, I sound like a broken record.

20:06.980 --> 20:07.913
(Sighs)

20:09.515 --> 20:11.750
- Angelo: Hi.
- Hey.

20:11.784 --> 20:13.852
(Chattering)

20:13.887 --> 20:16.522
Macchiato, extra foam.

20:16.556 --> 20:19.591
- Decaf of course.
- How do you know what I drink?

20:20.593 --> 20:22.561
- Rome.
- Rome.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.531
- Right.
- (Both chuckle)

20:25.566 --> 20:28.234
So things have gotten so ugly,

20:28.268 --> 20:30.136
I thought it would be a good idea for us

20:30.170 --> 20:32.171
to just sit down and
talk about something else,

20:32.205 --> 20:35.207
anything else, except...

20:35.242 --> 20:37.776
(Breathes deeply)

20:37.811 --> 20:41.915
- Okay.
- So I'm chaperoning a party tonight

20:41.949 --> 20:43.817
for Bay and her friend from school.

20:43.851 --> 20:46.653
- Oh no.
- Yes, exactly.

20:46.688 --> 20:50.524
So I was wondering if you
can come over and help me.

20:50.559 --> 20:52.693
I would rent "Roman Holiday"

20:52.727 --> 20:55.262
and we could do a do-over.

20:56.398 --> 20:58.432
Yeah, I don't think so.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.135
Or no movie. We could just hang out,

21:01.170 --> 21:03.137
continue not yelling at each other.

21:03.172 --> 21:05.106
Unless you have other plans.

21:08.144 --> 21:11.880
Hey, honey. We heard about what happened.

21:11.914 --> 21:13.849
Why didn't you tell us?

21:13.883 --> 21:16.751
I guess I just didn't want you to worry.

21:16.785 --> 21:18.687
That's our job.

21:18.721 --> 21:21.657
I'm so sorry we weren't
at the police station.

21:21.691 --> 21:23.592
- We should've been,
- It's okay.

21:23.627 --> 21:26.929
And that bruise... I
want you to see my doctor.

21:26.963 --> 21:29.698
No, it's getting better. It doesn't hurt.

21:29.733 --> 21:31.533
I'm fine. I promise.

21:32.569 --> 21:34.470
Okay. (Sighs)

21:36.607 --> 21:40.343
Hey, are you going to Bay's party tonight?

21:40.378 --> 21:42.178
Yeah, I'll probably stop by.

21:42.213 --> 21:45.281
Wait. Could you do me a favor

21:45.316 --> 21:47.284
and text me on the way there and back?

21:47.318 --> 21:49.152
You're such an independent kid,

21:49.187 --> 21:50.987
and I love you for that,

21:51.022 --> 21:52.756
but I really think

21:52.790 --> 21:55.826
we should be checking in a little more.

21:55.860 --> 21:57.060
Okay?

21:58.896 --> 22:00.564
Sure.

22:00.598 --> 22:01.799
Thanks.

22:08.639 --> 22:10.740
<i>Bay: So there's gonna be food and music</i>

22:10.775 --> 22:13.277
and absolutely no couples dancing.

22:13.311 --> 22:16.613
And I'm calling it "all the single people."

22:18.316 --> 22:19.516
It's a working title.

22:19.968 --> 22:22.187
_

22:22.188 --> 22:24.287
(Chuckles, inhales sharply)

22:24.322 --> 22:27.057
I know that you hate Valentine's Day,

22:27.091 --> 22:29.893
but this is sort of an anti-that.

22:29.927 --> 22:32.995
- Sure, maybe I'll swing by.
- Sounds good.

22:43.507 --> 22:47.576
Hey. So I'm having this
single people's party thing

22:47.610 --> 22:50.613
at Angelo's tonight. You should come by.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.550
I'm sorry. Is this weird?

22:55.585 --> 22:58.287
Am I not even supposed to be asking?

22:58.321 --> 22:59.488
Because I thought that we...

22:59.489 --> 23:00.890
_

23:03.404 --> 23:06.427
_

23:06.479 --> 23:10.233
Oh. (Scoffs) Yeah, of course. Duh.

23:10.926 --> 23:12.776
_

23:12.836 --> 23:14.003
Yeah.

23:16.940 --> 23:17.873
(Sighs)

23:23.780 --> 23:26.448
<i>- Regina: Hey.
- Hey.</i>

23:27.584 --> 23:29.585
Any word from the precinct?

23:29.619 --> 23:31.320
They're still investigating.

23:31.354 --> 23:33.522
I came by to grab some
paperwork from the truck.

23:33.557 --> 23:36.259
They need it. Where is
the truck, by the way?

23:37.361 --> 23:39.262
- I sold it.
- I don't understand.

23:39.297 --> 23:41.131
I have a friend with a used dealership.

23:41.165 --> 23:44.168
- I got a great price.
- You sold the truck without discussing it with me?

23:44.202 --> 23:46.170
I'm discussing it with you right now.

23:46.204 --> 23:49.039
I don't know if this was meant
to put me in my place or what...

23:49.074 --> 23:50.941
It was a practical decision, Regina.

23:50.976 --> 23:53.978
I mean, come on. What's it gonna take,

23:54.012 --> 23:55.880
Daphne crashing that thing into a tree

23:55.914 --> 23:57.648
for us all to wake up and do something?

23:57.682 --> 23:59.650
The truck had to go. End of story.

23:59.684 --> 24:01.585
You just bulldoze in...

24:01.619 --> 24:03.854
John Kennish, who knows
what's best for everyone.

24:03.888 --> 24:06.723
I'd say you know a thing
or two about bulldozing.

24:08.326 --> 24:10.194
Nothing has changed since the day we met,

24:10.228 --> 24:12.229
has it? (Scoffs)

24:20.403 --> 24:23.070
(Sighs) I can't believe I am
officially old enough to chaperone.

24:23.104 --> 24:24.938
(Chuckles) I hate to break it to you,

24:24.972 --> 24:26.972
- but you're old enough to be a mother, so...
- I know.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.207
<i>- (Door closes)
- Hey.</i>

24:29.276 --> 24:31.711
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:31.745 --> 24:34.847
Don't touch the roses. I
just spray-painted them.

24:34.882 --> 24:36.683
Well, happy Valentine's Day.

24:37.785 --> 24:40.419
(Sighs)

24:40.454 --> 24:42.688
- Or un-Valentine's Day.
- Lana is helping me to host.

24:42.723 --> 24:44.590
<i>Angelo, I cannot thank you enough</i>

24:44.624 --> 24:46.558
for letting me have this here.

24:46.593 --> 24:49.461
Quick question for you... are
your neighbors the cool kind

24:49.495 --> 24:51.529
or the calling-in-a-noise-violation kind?

24:51.564 --> 24:54.399
- I don't know. Why?
- 'Cause deaf people like their music loud.

24:54.433 --> 24:56.301
Like, really loud.

24:56.335 --> 24:58.236
(Sighs)

24:58.270 --> 25:00.371
Please let people come.
Please let people come.

25:00.406 --> 25:01.973
Hmm.

25:05.811 --> 25:07.178
- Hey.
- Hi there.

25:08.747 --> 25:10.148
So Bay's throwing this party

25:10.182 --> 25:13.018
and is worried that not that
many people are gonna show up,

25:13.052 --> 25:15.554
so I was thinking we could swing by there

25:15.588 --> 25:17.489
- before dinner, if that's cool.
- Sure.

25:17.523 --> 25:20.726
Sounds good. I don't
really care what we do.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.495
I mean, if you don't want to
go to dinner, we don't have to.

25:23.530 --> 25:24.730
I love you too.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.232
Really?

25:28.268 --> 25:29.401
Yeah.

25:29.435 --> 25:31.337
(Inhales deeply, hums)

25:31.371 --> 25:34.172
I was so worried that I
completely freaked you out.

25:34.206 --> 25:35.974
(Both laugh)

25:36.008 --> 25:39.244
You didn't. I've been thinking
about saying it for a while.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.746
(Chuckles)

25:43.916 --> 25:46.784
Oh, I got you something.

25:48.620 --> 25:52.656
I got it on this really awesome
missions trip to Guatemala.

25:52.690 --> 25:55.692
Some, like, 100-year-old man handmade it.

25:58.563 --> 26:01.432
I love it. And I love you.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.168
Still. From one minute ago.

26:05.202 --> 26:07.203
But it's kinda fun to say, right?

26:07.238 --> 26:08.404
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:15.145 --> 26:17.247
<i>- (Chuckles)
- (Hard rock music playing)</i>

26:18.816 --> 26:22.886
People will arrive, I hope.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.955
Oh, having fun?

26:26.691 --> 26:29.493
Hey! Thank you guys so much for coming.

26:29.527 --> 26:30.761
You don't have to stay too long.

26:30.795 --> 26:32.563
Honestly, you're just filler at this point.

26:32.597 --> 26:34.398
Well, we're happy to help.

26:34.432 --> 26:35.733
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

26:35.767 --> 26:37.668
- Kitchen.
- Okay.

26:37.702 --> 26:40.204
(Chuckles)

26:40.238 --> 26:42.606
Why did I do this? I hate throwing parties.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.209
This is gonna be just like
my seventh-grade birthday

26:45.243 --> 26:48.111
when everybody went to Jessica
Hind's pool party instead of mine.

26:48.146 --> 26:50.046
People will show up.

26:50.080 --> 26:53.016
I'm sure everyone's just fashionably late.

26:53.050 --> 26:56.219
- It's only been an hour.
- One of my least favorite things that humans do.

26:59.190 --> 27:01.825
Did you get born again
in the past 12 hours?

27:02.960 --> 27:06.763
Oh, I didn't notice
that. Nikki gave it to me.

27:07.765 --> 27:09.565
(Sighs)

27:09.600 --> 27:11.567
This is so dumb. I was kinda hoping

27:11.602 --> 27:12.701
to kiss someone tonight.

27:12.736 --> 27:14.470
At your party for single people?

27:14.504 --> 27:15.637
I haven't been kissed in months.

27:15.672 --> 27:18.374
- So you and Zara never...
- No.

27:18.408 --> 27:21.176
I don't know. She kinda gave off that vibe.

27:21.211 --> 27:23.245
<i>- No.
- (Door closes)</i>

27:23.280 --> 27:25.414
<i>* Better run, run away... *</i>

27:27.918 --> 27:30.018
This party is officially looking up.

27:34.180 --> 27:34.946
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:35.348 --> 27:37.416
Glad you could tear
yourself away from Oregon.

27:37.451 --> 27:39.952
It's the 154th birthday. It'll have others.

27:39.987 --> 27:42.221
So, coats go in the bedroom.

27:42.256 --> 27:46.025
There are assorted snacks in the kitchen.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.228
There's a flask of contraband
in Matthew's backpack,

27:48.262 --> 27:49.929
though that may just be a rumor.

27:49.963 --> 27:51.731
Cool. (Chuckles)

27:51.765 --> 27:54.600
And, of course, abiding by the
rules of the single people's party,

27:54.635 --> 27:56.769
there will be no hooking up whatsoever.

27:56.803 --> 27:58.738
Definitely not. We're
all just friends here.

27:59.907 --> 28:01.474
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

28:04.412 --> 28:06.346
(Sighs)

28:06.380 --> 28:09.316
- (Vacuum stops)
- Even for him, it's bad.

28:09.350 --> 28:11.284
The most presumptuous, aggressive...

28:11.319 --> 28:14.454
"I don't give a damn
about you or anyone else."

28:14.489 --> 28:17.057
- You're not saying anything.
- I'm listening.

28:17.092 --> 28:19.359
He sold her food truck without asking me.

28:19.394 --> 28:21.295
<i>- I heard.
- And Kathryn coming at me like that.</i>

28:21.329 --> 28:24.297
"Why didn't you tell us? Why
haven't you taken her to the doctor?"

28:24.331 --> 28:26.799
And then jumping on me because I didn't use

28:26.833 --> 28:28.734
their connections at the police station.

28:28.768 --> 28:30.569
It will always come
down to that for them...

28:30.604 --> 28:32.872
that they could've done better
because they have more money.

28:32.906 --> 28:34.840
I am sick of it... damn sick of it.

28:34.874 --> 28:36.875
I have heard you talk
about a lot of people,

28:36.909 --> 28:38.743
but not the most important one...

28:38.778 --> 28:41.512
- Daphne.
- Of course I am worried about Daphne.

28:41.547 --> 28:43.581
I'm just telling you what
happened with the truck.

28:43.615 --> 28:46.484
You're all focused on who
did what, who's in charge,

28:46.518 --> 28:50.154
who's a better parent. Daphne got attacked.

28:50.189 --> 28:53.157
Why don't you just stop fighting with them

28:53.192 --> 28:56.027
- and worry about her?
- You are always taking their side.

28:56.061 --> 28:57.328
I'm not taking their side.

28:58.965 --> 29:01.133
- I'm taking Daphne's side.
- (Sighs)

29:04.171 --> 29:05.905
<i>(Door closes)</i>

29:08.142 --> 29:10.677
So how did it go with the producer?

29:10.711 --> 29:11.945
It was pretty sick, actually.

29:11.979 --> 29:14.516
Yeah, we're just waiting to
see how the rough mix turns out.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.553
Angelo set us up with a guy who produced

29:16.587 --> 29:18.588
a bunch of the Flaming Lips' albums.

29:18.623 --> 29:19.723
Awesome.

29:25.529 --> 29:27.230
Toby's a really great guy.

29:27.264 --> 29:30.133
Way better than the guys I
dated when I was your age.

29:30.167 --> 29:32.067
(Chuckles)

29:32.102 --> 29:34.470
So have you been thinking about names?

29:34.504 --> 29:39.075
I've been thinking about adoption actually,

29:39.109 --> 29:41.277
so that really wouldn't
be my decision to make.

29:41.311 --> 29:44.247
Well, nothing has really been decided.

29:44.281 --> 29:46.817
It's something we've been considering.

29:46.851 --> 29:49.954
Well, either way, it's crazy
how it's all worked out.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.989
I mean, you got a second chance.

29:52.023 --> 29:54.725
It's like it's all meant to be.

29:54.759 --> 29:58.562
Yeah. That's one way to look at it.

29:59.630 --> 30:01.665
I will be praying for a safe birth.

30:01.699 --> 30:03.467
God will have his hands on it.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.603
And also the doctor.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.572
God will have his hands on him too.

30:07.607 --> 30:10.542
- Or her.
- (Chuckles)

30:10.576 --> 30:12.210
Here's hoping.

30:12.245 --> 30:15.414
<i>* Can't take my love from me *</i>

30:15.448 --> 30:19.117
<i>* not if I'm dragged
across the continents... *</i>

30:19.152 --> 30:22.120
Hey, I heard about what happened.

30:22.155 --> 30:24.222
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.693
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

30:27.727 --> 30:30.062
Yeah, I totally wish I would've
gone with you that night.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.963
Why, because you're hearing?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.899
You would've automatically saved the day?

30:33.933 --> 30:36.970
Hey, Daphne. I want you to meet Lana.

30:37.004 --> 30:38.938
Hey. It's nice to meet you.

30:38.972 --> 30:42.509
<i>- Lana, this is Daphne.
- (Door opens)</i>

30:44.779 --> 30:47.314
Uh, excuse me.

30:51.471 --> 30:54.335

30:54.336 --> 30:59.580
_

30:59.581 --> 31:01.804
_

31:03.718 --> 31:06.742
_

31:06.745 --> 31:07.836
(Exhales sharply)

31:07.837 --> 31:09.468
_

31:12.243 --> 31:14.878
Hey, did you see Regina today?

31:14.912 --> 31:17.046
No, I haven't.

31:17.081 --> 31:19.816
I've been avoiding her.
Or she's been avoiding me.

31:19.851 --> 31:21.618
It's kind of a mutual avoidance.

31:21.653 --> 31:23.720
Yeah well, she dropped
by the car wash today.

31:23.755 --> 31:25.589
I told her that I sold the food truck.

31:25.624 --> 31:27.758
Needless to say, she was not very pleased.

31:27.793 --> 31:30.662
Wait. You sold the food truck?

31:30.696 --> 31:33.498
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

31:33.533 --> 31:36.467
- Without checking with me?
- Why is everybody tearing this apart?

31:36.502 --> 31:39.137
- It was the right thing to do.
- It doesn't matter!

31:39.171 --> 31:42.273
- You can't just swoop in and take over to fix things.
- I wasn't just swooping in.

31:42.307 --> 31:44.442
- I've been going over and over in my head...
- I'm trying to protect her.

31:44.476 --> 31:46.377
- I'm not gonna apologize for that.
- "What did we do wrong?

31:46.411 --> 31:49.312
- Why didn't she tell us?" And now I get it!
- You get what?

31:49.347 --> 31:51.314
You are driving her away!

31:51.349 --> 31:54.017
She doesn't tell us
things, important things,

31:54.052 --> 31:57.722
- because you do things like this!
- That is absolutely ridiculous.

31:57.756 --> 31:59.991
I wanna get close to her and
every time I build a bridge,

32:00.025 --> 32:02.893
it gets washed away when
you behave like this!

32:04.563 --> 32:05.696
(Keys scrape, jingle)

32:05.731 --> 32:07.798
Happy Valentine's Day.

32:07.833 --> 32:09.634
<i>- You too!
- (Door opens)</i>

32:22.148 --> 32:24.516
One minute I'm sure that he likes me,

32:24.551 --> 32:27.153
and then the next he's treating me

32:27.188 --> 32:29.290
like some distant cousin.

32:29.996 --> 32:32.054
_

32:32.055 --> 32:36.140
_

32:36.146 --> 32:37.865
Huh. I'm in.

32:38.933 --> 32:41.836
<i>* Like I'm your only *</i>

32:41.870 --> 32:43.837
<i>* make me want... *</i>

32:43.872 --> 32:47.074
Uh, sorry. Hold on one second.

32:47.109 --> 32:48.810
Noah.

32:50.546 --> 32:51.880
I can't hear anything.

32:51.914 --> 32:55.484
- What do you mean?
- I can't hear what you're saying to me.

32:55.518 --> 32:58.357
Okay, can... can I help? Can I do anything?

32:58.391 --> 33:00.492
- No no no, just leave me alone, okay?
- What? Noah!

33:00.526 --> 33:02.561
<i>* Tried to get me off your back... *</i>

33:02.595 --> 33:04.196
Okay.

33:04.230 --> 33:07.366
<i>* But I know you, oh *</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:09.501
<i>* I know you, oh *</i>

33:09.535 --> 33:13.139
<i>* go ahead and say goodbye *</i>

33:13.173 --> 33:15.107
<i>* tell me I'll be fine... *</i>

33:17.549 --> 33:19.590
_

33:20.079 --> 33:21.847
Thought you had plans.

33:21.848 --> 33:23.490
_

33:23.783 --> 33:26.952
(Chuckles) I'm really
glad that you're here.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.160
_

33:32.879 --> 33:34.253

33:34.930 --> 33:37.219
_

33:37.220 --> 33:40.600
_

33:40.603 --> 33:41.325
(Chuckles) Yeah, sure.

33:50.175 --> 33:53.111
- Hey.
- (Chuckles) Oh. Daphne.

33:53.145 --> 33:54.445
Yeah.

33:56.115 --> 33:57.915
We were at the state fair.

33:57.950 --> 34:00.918
She was obsessed with
petting the farm animals.

34:00.952 --> 34:03.721
She was a vegetarian before
she even knew what it was.

34:03.755 --> 34:06.657
When you found out that she wasn't yours...

34:06.691 --> 34:07.925
that must've been hard for you.

34:09.695 --> 34:10.761
It was.

34:11.964 --> 34:13.898
I cannot lose that second chance.

34:13.931 --> 34:17.568
Angelo, it is a big deal to raise a kid.

34:17.603 --> 34:19.370
No, I know, but I can do it.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.639
I would get help. I will
give you as much time

34:21.672 --> 34:23.606
or as little time as you want with her.

34:23.641 --> 34:27.143
But in my heart, I know I'm
the one who should raise her.

34:29.313 --> 34:31.281
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

34:31.315 --> 34:34.184
- Oh, hey there.
- Hey yourself.

34:34.217 --> 34:36.286
Man, Angelo has got a
pretty sweet collection.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.255
Sometimes I wish he was my dad...

34:42.226 --> 34:46.027
Hey, do you wanna get outta here?

34:46.062 --> 34:50.766
- Go somewhere more private?
- Sure.

34:50.801 --> 34:52.869
<i>* Walk the floor *</i>

<i>* and you refuse to let me in... *</i>

34:58.441 --> 35:00.608
It's happening more and more lately.

35:00.643 --> 35:04.312
- Just have to ride it out.
- Well, if this music gets any louder,

35:04.346 --> 35:06.547
then we're all gonna go
deaf, so... (Chuckles)

35:06.582 --> 35:10.151
- Yeah, it's way too loud.
- Let's just sign instead.

35:11.287 --> 35:13.190
- (Sighs)
- Hey.

35:14.361 --> 35:16.162
Can you turn that down?

35:16.163 --> 35:17.530
_

35:17.535 --> 35:20.032

35:32.980 --> 35:34.914
Okay, Noah, stop. It's no big deal.

What? You... you want this?

- What's going on?

You know what? I am sick of you people.

We're trying. I'm trying.

_

35:55.740 --> 35:58.070
I can make fun of you too.

35:59.439 --> 36:01.306
that you sound like a freaking seal

- Oh my... stop them!

36:23.629 --> 36:25.630
<i>Tell them to stop! No!</i>

36:25.664 --> 36:28.700
(Grunting)

36:28.735 --> 36:30.636
- Noah! No, stop!
- No! Just stop it!

36:33.306 --> 36:35.440
No! Travis, stop!

36:35.474 --> 36:38.176
Break it up! (Grunts) Stop!

36:38.210 --> 36:41.479
Enough. Enough.

36:51.749 --> 36:53.083
So are you... are you okay?

36:54.685 --> 36:57.988
Umm... actually, no.

36:58.022 --> 36:59.823
What happened?

36:59.857 --> 37:02.659
I believe with my whole self

37:02.693 --> 37:03.860
that there is a God

37:03.895 --> 37:07.431
and that he has his hands on my life.

37:07.465 --> 37:10.267
- I know.
- And I would never wanna force you

37:10.301 --> 37:11.435
to be someone you're not

37:11.469 --> 37:13.604
or to believe in something you don't.

37:13.638 --> 37:16.273
Nikki, I love that you believe that.

37:16.308 --> 37:18.375
But you don't share it with me.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.344
No, but I... I respect it.

37:21.379 --> 37:23.314
I just don't know if that's enough.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.953
What are you saying?

37:28.988 --> 37:32.090
It's just gonna hurt us even
more if we don't end it now.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.093
Are you serious?

37:40.728 --> 37:41.961
I'm sorry.

37:41.995 --> 37:44.596
<i>* I can't say I didn't try... *</i>

37:44.631 --> 37:46.665

<i>(Door opens)</i>

38:00.578 --> 38:02.512
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:02.546 --> 38:06.249
- Where's John?
- I'm not sure.

38:06.283 --> 38:10.074
He told me about the truck and I
wasn't very happy about it either.

38:10.108 --> 38:13.098
He should've consulted you... and me.

38:13.133 --> 38:15.995
<i>Thank you. But, you
know, that's how we felt</i>

38:16.029 --> 38:18.827
when you didn't tell us
about Daphne being assaulted.

38:18.861 --> 38:20.724
(Sighs)

38:20.758 --> 38:23.951
I wasn't consciously
trying to leave you out.

38:23.986 --> 38:27.815
I guess I just worried that she
didn't tell me the night it happened

38:27.850 --> 38:32.342
because I haven't been
signing. She told Melody first.

38:32.376 --> 38:35.405
Oh, Regina.

38:35.439 --> 38:38.434
I'm sure she just didn't
know how to tell you.

38:38.469 --> 38:43.061
Maybe. Is this ever gonna get easier?

38:43.096 --> 38:45.092
(Chuckles) Probably not.

38:45.126 --> 38:47.423
(Sighs)

38:47.458 --> 38:49.255
<i>(Door closes)</i>

38:52.019 --> 38:53.915
I bought the truck back.

38:59.176 --> 39:01.707
- Thank you.
- Don't get me wrong.

39:01.741 --> 39:02.805
I still wanna get rid of it,

39:02.838 --> 39:05.701
but I think we should
talk about it together...

39:06.701 --> 39:07.698
as a unit.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.761
- (Sighs)
- I think we should sell it.

39:13.693 --> 39:14.657
Me too.

39:15.723 --> 39:17.753
- Unbelievable.
- (Women chuckle)

39:17.788 --> 39:20.383

any ice or anything.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.843
So this quiche will have to suffice.

40:53.877 --> 40:55.576
Thanks.

40:56.774 --> 40:57.838
I'm so sorry.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.702
I force you to come to my party

40:59.737 --> 41:00.868
and you get decked.

41:00.902 --> 41:03.631
No, I... (Chuckles)

41:03.665 --> 41:05.531
I deserved it.

41:05.565 --> 41:08.528
I was just pissed off
and I took it out on him.

41:08.562 --> 41:12.357
It's this whole, uh,
losing-my-hearing thing.

41:12.391 --> 41:15.187
I'm not really taking it that well.

41:15.221 --> 41:17.351
Well, how else are you supposed to take it?

41:21.214 --> 41:23.211
- (Sighs)
- Okay, far be it from me

41:23.246 --> 41:25.176
to bug the guy who's just been slugged,

41:25.210 --> 41:27.373
but you have kind of been
all over the map with me

41:27.408 --> 41:29.936
and I can't really figure it out.

41:29.970 --> 41:32.134
I heard there was some...

41:32.168 --> 41:35.035
epic romance with you and Emmett last year.

Bay and Emmett, Bay and Emmett, you know.

41:38.168 --> 41:41.963
- (Sighs)
- You asked around about me.

41:41.997 --> 41:45.126
You even had a name... eBay.

41:45.161 --> 41:48.056
- (Snickers) I hadn't heard that.
- (Chuckles)

41:49.089 --> 41:50.786
I like you.

(Both chuckle)

41:57.148 --> 41:59.810
Sorry. I went in too fast and...

Try that again.

- You never hear anything about South Dakota.

- Nothing. Not one word.
