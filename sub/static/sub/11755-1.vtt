00:38.644 --> 00:40.610
<i>- Fabien garcia,</i>
<i>one of the leading members</i>

00:40.612 --> 00:43.213
<i>of the martial arts action</i>
<i>team known as the z team,</i>

00:43.215 --> 00:44.948
<i>has just received</i>

00:44.950 --> 00:47.317
<i>the male action performer</i>
<i>of the year award</i>

00:47.319 --> 00:49.185
<i>for his first short film.</i>

00:49.187 --> 00:51.121
<i>Fabien and his friends</i>
<i>have been training in china</i>

00:51.123 --> 00:52.722
<i>for the past nine years,</i>

00:52.724 --> 00:55.859
<i>notably at the famous</i>
<i>shaolin monastery.</i>

00:55.861 --> 00:58.628
<i>Fabien, this award</i>
<i>is a very good start.</i>

00:58.630 --> 01:01.665
<i>So what's the next step</i>
<i>for you and your team?</i>

01:01.667 --> 01:03.667
<i>- We all want to move</i>
<i>to hollywood,</i>

01:03.669 --> 01:06.636
<i>take our chances</i>
<i>and see what happens.</i>

01:06.638 --> 01:07.704
<i>- Hollywood?</i>

01:09.841 --> 01:10.941
- C'mon, man.

01:10.943 --> 01:13.310
You don't have to do this shit.

01:13.312 --> 01:16.813
C'mon, man, shit, man.
Just lemme go, alright?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.248
Just...

01:29.194 --> 01:30.627
- Are you happy now?

01:37.369 --> 01:39.369
- Happy birthday, baby.

01:39.371 --> 01:41.137
<i> Happy birthday, man.</i>

01:41.139 --> 01:42.172
<i>Nice camera, dude.</i>

01:42.174 --> 01:44.174
<i> Ahh, that's so cute.</i>

01:44.176 --> 01:46.209
<i>The camera model you wanted.</i>

01:46.211 --> 01:47.277
- You're welcome.

01:53.318 --> 01:54.751
<i> Happy birthday.</i>

01:54.753 --> 01:56.252
- That's nice, wow.

01:56.254 --> 01:57.854
- Nice. Thank you, thank you.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.356
<i>We thought you might need it</i>

01:59.358 --> 02:02.826
<i>to shoot your next</i>
<i>award-winning show film.</i>

02:02.828 --> 02:04.669
- Just need something
to shoot now.

02:05.631 --> 02:06.696
- Another gift.

02:07.799 --> 02:09.765
- Ooh, who is this one from?

02:11.236 --> 02:12.936
- Don't know.
Just some address.

02:12.938 --> 02:14.304
- That's weird.

02:14.306 --> 02:16.873
- A secret lover maybe?

02:16.875 --> 02:19.309
<i> Ooh, eh?</i>

02:25.250 --> 02:27.917
<i>- Wow, a slate.</i>
<i>- Nice.</i>

02:27.919 --> 02:28.952
<i>"The price of success."</i>

02:29.988 --> 02:31.054
Yeah.

02:32.224 --> 02:34.357
- And... action.

02:41.199 --> 02:42.799
<i> Here is my wife.</i>

02:42.801 --> 02:44.934
- Hi, baby.
<i>-  Here's her friend.</i>

02:44.936 --> 02:46.002
<i>Hello.</i>

02:47.739 --> 02:50.373
<i>And here is our buddy, jess.</i>

02:50.375 --> 02:52.709
<i>Are you happy to be</i>
<i>going back to china?</i>

02:52.711 --> 02:54.444
- I miss you already.
What's that?

02:54.446 --> 02:55.779
<i> I say, are you happy</i>
<i>to be going back to china?</i>

02:55.781 --> 02:56.780
- Oh!

02:56.782 --> 02:57.914
<i> What?</i>

02:57.916 --> 02:59.783
- I haven't told fabien yet.

02:59.785 --> 03:01.351
<i> Oh, sorry.</i>

03:01.353 --> 03:03.286
- You haven't told fabien what?

03:04.956 --> 03:06.222
- ...'cause I wanted
to make sure I had the job

03:06.224 --> 03:07.691
before telling you.

03:07.693 --> 03:09.793
And I know how important
it is to you

03:09.795 --> 03:11.828
that the z team succeed
here in l.A.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.263
- And I thought it was
important for all of us.

03:13.265 --> 03:14.798
<i> Of course.</i>

03:14.800 --> 03:16.366
I mean, I'd rather stay here
with you guys

03:16.368 --> 03:20.003
but our careers aren't even
close to being off the ground.

03:21.339 --> 03:22.472
- To tell you the truth,

03:22.474 --> 03:23.973
I already knew
you were leaving.

03:23.975 --> 03:26.342
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

03:26.344 --> 03:28.878
- Oh. Of course, it's hard
to keep a secret

03:28.880 --> 03:31.347
between brothers, meilu.

03:31.349 --> 03:33.316
- Yeah, but you
could have told me.

03:34.853 --> 03:36.419
- When are you leaving?

03:36.421 --> 03:37.754
- They want me
to work for them before

03:37.756 --> 03:39.856
the Hong kong film festival.

03:39.858 --> 03:41.925
- He is very famous in china.

03:41.927 --> 03:43.460
I think it's great.

03:43.462 --> 03:45.095
You should be proud, jess.

03:45.097 --> 03:46.362
- Thank you.

03:46.364 --> 03:48.465
- You'll be close to.

03:48.467 --> 03:50.967
- Yeah, instead of becoming.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.336
- You see, that's why
I didn't tell you.

03:53.338 --> 03:54.804
<i> Hey, guys, chill out.</i>

03:54.806 --> 03:57.073
<i>Let's go have a drink, huh?</i>

03:57.075 --> 03:58.475
<i>C'mon.</i>

03:58.477 --> 04:01.344
- You know what?
We all just need to grow up.

04:01.346 --> 04:03.947
We cannot keep chasing
this dream forever.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.083
- Did you get that?

04:07.085 --> 04:08.284
<i> Why would you say that?</i>

04:08.286 --> 04:09.786
<i>Okay, let's turn off</i>
<i>this camera.</i>

04:09.788 --> 04:11.508
- No, no, no. Keep recording.

04:12.290 --> 04:13.290
I want to see that.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.491
<i> Okay.</i>

04:14.493 --> 04:16.760
- We need to be more realistic.

04:16.762 --> 04:18.327
I mean, don't you think
if we were good enough

04:18.329 --> 04:20.363
we'd already be making
our movie by now?

04:20.365 --> 04:22.198
I mean, we've got talent
and, fabien,

04:22.200 --> 04:25.435
you're a good director
but the business is tough.

04:25.437 --> 04:26.970
<i>I think maybe it's time</i>
<i>for all of you</i>

04:26.972 --> 04:29.472
<i>to start considering</i>
<i>something else.</i>

04:31.209 --> 04:33.476
- I just think we don't
want it bad enough.

04:33.478 --> 04:36.045
We need to get out there,
make sacrifices.

04:36.047 --> 04:37.447
<i> Sacrifices?</i>

04:37.449 --> 04:38.948
<i>I left my wife in china</i>
<i>to be here.</i>

04:38.950 --> 04:40.483
- I know.

04:40.485 --> 04:43.987
I just think we're waiting
too long for things to happen.

04:43.989 --> 04:46.923
For spielberg to come
get all of you.

04:46.925 --> 04:48.024
We need to fight for it.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.926
He has to be all existence.

04:49.928 --> 04:52.195
- That's a bit much,
don't you think?

04:52.197 --> 04:53.863
- No, I don't.

04:53.865 --> 04:56.399
I don't want to die
before we've made our movie.

04:56.401 --> 04:58.001
And we're getting old.

04:58.003 --> 05:00.804
So time commences right now.

05:00.806 --> 05:02.839
- You make it sound so easy.

05:02.841 --> 05:05.341
I mean, yeah, winning an award
for a short film is one thing

05:05.343 --> 05:06.576
but getting money
for a feature film,

05:06.578 --> 05:07.977
that's much harder.

05:07.979 --> 05:10.213
You need money, a lot of money.

05:10.215 --> 05:12.215
Why don't you understand that?

05:12.217 --> 05:15.385
- If you spent as much time
helping us find that money

05:15.387 --> 05:17.320
as you spent
finding your new job,

05:17.322 --> 05:18.888
maybe we would be
shooting by now.

05:18.890 --> 05:20.256
<i> Fabien!</i>

05:20.258 --> 05:21.958
- Look, sorry, for having
other ambitions.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.460
I guess I missed you
knocking down spielberg's door.

05:24.462 --> 05:26.229
- You know what? Fuck you.

05:26.231 --> 05:27.831
This is important for me.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.899
You guys don't really
give a shit.

05:29.901 --> 05:32.502
<i> Aw, fabien...</i>

05:32.504 --> 05:34.424
<i> Okay, let's turn</i>
<i>this thing off.</i>

06:12.577 --> 06:15.311
<i>Hey babe, are you there?</i>

06:59.257 --> 07:01.991
- Did you get a call back?

07:01.993 --> 07:04.594
- Yeah, exactly...

07:07.299 --> 07:09.299
- She's gonna be so pissed.

07:09.301 --> 07:11.968
- Yeah, much more
than you think.

07:11.970 --> 07:13.536
- Yeah, I know we're late.

07:13.538 --> 07:15.238
- No, you're just in time.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.239
<i> What?</i>

07:16.241 --> 07:17.440
- Listen to me carefully.

07:17.442 --> 07:18.675
- Who are you?

07:18.677 --> 07:20.510
<i>Who I am is not important.</i>

07:20.512 --> 07:22.712
<i>What's important</i>
<i>is that I have meilu.</i>

07:22.714 --> 07:24.948
- Is this a joke?

07:24.950 --> 07:26.516
<i> Unfortunately for you,</i>
<i>it's not.</i>

07:26.518 --> 07:28.251
<i>But if you do everything</i>
<i>as I say,</i>

07:28.253 --> 07:29.352
<i>then she won't get hurt.</i>

07:29.354 --> 07:30.520
- You're kidding, right?

07:30.522 --> 07:32.088
<i> Stop asking questions.</i>

07:32.090 --> 07:33.423
<i>I have meilu.</i>

07:33.425 --> 07:35.291
<i>That should be</i>
<i>your only concern.</i>

07:35.293 --> 07:36.559
- How do I know
you're telling the truth

07:36.561 --> 07:38.528
and you simply
haven't stolen her phone?

07:38.530 --> 07:40.330
Give her the phone.

07:40.332 --> 07:42.432
<i> I'll send you something.</i>

07:53.378 --> 07:54.444
- Who is this guy?

07:59.517 --> 08:00.650
- Oh, fuck!

08:00.652 --> 08:01.718
- God!

08:01.720 --> 08:03.286
- We need to call the police.

08:03.288 --> 08:06.289
- Can't be real, right?

08:06.291 --> 08:07.623
<i>- If you lay a hand on her...</i>

08:07.625 --> 08:09.392
Now that I have
your attention,

08:09.394 --> 08:11.427
her future's in your hands,
so all four of you

08:11.429 --> 08:13.396
go to the trash can
in front of you.

08:13.398 --> 08:15.264
There's a black bag in it.
Take it out and open it.

08:15.266 --> 08:16.265
<i>- To the trash can.</i>

08:16.267 --> 08:17.767
- Why the trash can?

08:17.769 --> 08:20.236
<i> Hey, what's happening?</i>
<i>What did he say?</i>

08:20.238 --> 08:21.437
<i> What's going on?</i>

08:21.439 --> 08:24.307
- I don't know.
- This is crazy.

08:24.309 --> 08:26.009
- What is this?

08:26.011 --> 08:27.744
- Fabien, do you know anyone
who wants to hurt you?

08:27.746 --> 08:29.012
- No.
- Do you owe someone money?

08:29.014 --> 08:30.279
- No.

08:30.281 --> 08:31.447
- Come on, there's
got to be someone.

08:31.449 --> 08:32.715
- I don't know what,
I don't know.

08:32.717 --> 08:35.385
- Just calm down.
Let's figure this out.

08:35.386 --> 08:36.519
What's in the bag?

08:36.520 --> 08:37.687
- Yeah, what's in the bag?

08:39.791 --> 08:41.491
What's this?

08:46.564 --> 08:47.730
- Call the police.

08:49.601 --> 08:51.267
<i> I wouldn't do that</i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

08:51.269 --> 08:53.403
<i>That call will bring</i>
<i>her immediate death.</i>

08:53.405 --> 08:55.605
<i>I don't think you understand</i>
<i>the gravity of this situation.</i>

08:55.607 --> 08:58.074
<i>Perhaps if I send you one of</i>
<i>meilu's pretty little fingers,</i>

08:58.076 --> 08:59.375
<i>you'll start listening to me.</i>

08:59.377 --> 09:00.643
- What do you want?

09:00.645 --> 09:02.412
<i> Each one of you</i>
<i>take a collar</i>

09:02.414 --> 09:03.413
<i>and fasten it around your neck.</i>

09:03.415 --> 09:05.281
<i>When attached,</i>

09:05.283 --> 09:08.551
<i>that collar will transmit</i>
<i>a gps signal of your location.</i>

09:08.553 --> 09:11.554
<i>And if you take it off,</i>
<i>I'll know it and meilu dies.</i>

09:11.556 --> 09:14.557
<i>Now throw your personal</i>
<i>cell phones into the trash can.</i>

09:21.699 --> 09:24.500
The phone I provided you
is programmed to call one number

09:24.502 --> 09:25.802
and that's mine.

09:25.804 --> 09:27.703
And you can't use it
for any other purpose.

09:27.705 --> 09:30.073
And if you don't listen,
then meilu dies.

09:30.075 --> 09:32.642
And if you try to contact
the cops, then she dies.

09:32.644 --> 09:36.179
And if you do anything
other than what I say, she dies.

09:36.181 --> 09:37.680
- Okay, we do what you want.

09:37.682 --> 09:39.615
<i> In five minutes,</i>
<i>an armored truck will stop</i>

09:39.617 --> 09:42.385
<i>in front of the united bank</i>
<i>which is right down the street.</i>

09:42.387 --> 09:44.120
<i>And you're to unload that truck</i>
<i>of its precious cargo.</i>

09:44.122 --> 09:45.822
- It's a trick, right?

09:45.824 --> 09:48.257
<i> You have four minutes</i>
<i>before the truck's arrival.</i>

09:48.259 --> 09:49.258
<i>Good luck.</i>

09:49.260 --> 09:50.693
- An armored truck?

09:50.695 --> 09:52.695
- You cannot expect us
to attack an armored truck.

09:52.697 --> 09:54.530
- He has meilu.
- That means he's fucked up.

09:54.532 --> 09:56.265
- Hey, we can't let fabien
do it alone, right?

09:56.267 --> 09:57.800
- Look, we have to help him.
He's watching us.

09:57.802 --> 09:59.802
He'll know if we don't.

09:59.804 --> 10:02.638
- We have four minutes to
get there before that truck.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.739
I don't have a choice.

10:03.741 --> 10:04.874
- Three minutes now.

10:04.876 --> 10:07.276
- Fuck.
- Sh...

10:16.588 --> 10:18.421
- Do you realize
what he's asking us to do?

10:18.423 --> 10:19.689
- We get it, didier.

10:19.691 --> 10:20.690
- We get it.

10:22.427 --> 10:24.827
- We simply explain our self
to the security guard.

10:24.829 --> 10:26.262
- There is no time for that.

10:26.264 --> 10:27.263
Jess, lohan, are you with me?

10:27.265 --> 10:28.698
- Yes, I'm in.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.266
- If something goes wrong,
we surrender, okay?

10:30.268 --> 10:31.267
- I don't think
they're allowed to shoot

10:31.269 --> 10:32.635
if we're not armed.

10:32.637 --> 10:35.571
- How much time
until the truck gets here?

10:35.573 --> 10:36.806
- None.

10:36.808 --> 10:37.874
<i> Oh damn it.</i>

10:40.845 --> 10:42.712
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

10:54.292 --> 10:55.525
- So what do we do now, huh?

10:55.527 --> 10:57.293
- It's alright.
Just act natural.

10:57.295 --> 10:58.975
- Yeah.
- Nothing happened.

10:59.831 --> 11:01.551
We don't want to blow this.

11:02.433 --> 11:03.533
We need a plan.

11:06.571 --> 11:08.304
- Did you guys see that
last soccer game?

11:08.306 --> 11:09.405
It was good, right?

11:09.407 --> 11:10.406
- Aw shit.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.707
- No, no, no.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.843
- We need a plan.
<i>-  We can't.</i>

11:13.845 --> 11:16.445
You guys go pretend you're
standing in line at the atm.

11:16.447 --> 11:17.880
You take care of the guards
when they come out.

11:17.882 --> 11:20.316
I take out the driver. Okay?

11:20.318 --> 11:21.384
- Just do it.

11:25.690 --> 11:26.889
- We are dead.

11:26.891 --> 11:28.624
Jeez.

11:37.936 --> 11:38.935
- How you doing, man?

11:38.937 --> 11:40.570
- I'm gonna go help fabien.

11:40.572 --> 11:41.737
You guys wait for the guards
to come out, okay?

11:41.739 --> 11:42.805
- Yeah, alright.

11:54.485 --> 11:56.552
What the...?

11:57.689 --> 11:58.754
- Let's go, let's go.

12:01.693 --> 12:02.774
- Let's get outta here.

12:09.367 --> 12:10.033
<i> The fun begins.</i>

12:10.034 --> 12:10.700
<i>There's a dumpster</i>
<i>right in front of you.</i>

12:10.702 --> 12:12.301
<i>Just throw the money bag in it.</i>

12:12.303 --> 12:14.303
- Why are you stopping?
What are you doing?

12:15.540 --> 12:17.341
<i> Just keep going straight.</i>

12:17.342 --> 12:19.642
<i>There'll be a restaurant</i>
<i>on your left-hand side.</i>

12:19.644 --> 12:20.743
- What did he say?
- Go, go, go, go, go.

12:20.745 --> 12:21.877
Come on, let's go.

12:24.582 --> 12:26.183
<i> Okay, sit down.</i>

12:27.318 --> 12:29.159
- Sit down. Sit down.
- What, what?

12:32.857 --> 12:35.391
- Relax, okay? You did great.

12:37.729 --> 12:40.796
Now count to 10
and go pick up the money bag.

12:40.798 --> 12:42.898
- What?

12:42.900 --> 12:45.501
- He want us to go back
and pick up the money.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.603
- Do you realize
what we just did?

12:47.605 --> 12:48.604
- Yes.

12:56.648 --> 12:57.780
- Fuck!

13:01.719 --> 13:03.452
- Okay, let's go.

13:11.929 --> 13:14.397
<i> A black suv is parked</i>
<i>at the end of the run.</i>

13:14.399 --> 13:16.332
<i>You'll find the keys</i>
<i>in the glove compartment.</i>

13:16.334 --> 13:17.667
- Okay.
- It should be over there.

13:17.669 --> 13:20.403
- Let's go, c'mon.
<i>-  Go, go, go.</i>

13:33.451 --> 13:34.717
- Hello?

13:34.719 --> 13:37.353
<i>Go to 5003 branford street.</i>

13:37.355 --> 13:38.621
<i>It's an abandoned hospital.</i>

13:38.623 --> 13:39.722
- Is meilu there?

13:39.724 --> 13:42.992
<i> 5003 branford street.</i>

13:43.961 --> 13:45.328
- So where we going?

13:45.330 --> 13:46.862
- We're gonna end up in prison.

13:46.864 --> 13:49.665
- We need to find the nearest
cop and turn ourselves in.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.734
They can help us.

13:51.736 --> 13:53.869
- Fabien, you have a cop
friend, right?

13:53.871 --> 13:55.771
Why don't you call him?

13:55.773 --> 13:59.575
- I don't know.
And how do we call discreetly?

13:59.577 --> 14:01.577
- A public phone.
We can use that.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.113
- But if this guy is spying
on us, we can't risk it.

14:04.115 --> 14:05.748
And he would see us
with this shit.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.383
- No, okay,
we'll call your friend,

14:07.385 --> 14:09.885
explain everything,
as soon as we get meilu back.

14:09.887 --> 14:10.953
- Okay, fine.

14:24.669 --> 14:27.737
- I think this is it.
5003 branford street.

14:27.739 --> 14:30.406
- What is this?
An abandoned hospital?

14:30.408 --> 14:31.474
- Let's find out.

15:06.511 --> 15:08.444
- So what are we
supposed to do here?

15:13.618 --> 15:14.699
- In case it's a trap.

15:23.628 --> 15:25.161
- Where is this fucking phone?

15:26.764 --> 15:28.664
- Here. Come here. Got it.

15:31.836 --> 15:33.436
<i> Leave the money here.</i>

15:33.438 --> 15:34.637
- And where's meilu?

15:34.639 --> 15:36.605
The deal was
the money for meilu.

15:36.607 --> 15:38.207
<i> Leave the money here</i>
<i>and go to...</i>

15:38.209 --> 15:39.742
- Look, we got you the money.
You give us meilu.

15:39.744 --> 15:41.210
That was the deal.

15:41.212 --> 15:42.878
<i> If you just do</i>
<i>what I tell you to do,</i>

15:42.880 --> 15:44.613
<i>you'll see her again real soon.</i>

15:44.615 --> 15:46.182
- Look, we have already done

15:46.184 --> 15:47.817
everything that you wanted,
okay?

15:47.819 --> 15:49.819
So give us meilu,
we give you the cash

15:49.821 --> 15:50.820
and we won't say anything.

15:50.822 --> 15:52.188
- Enough, okay?

15:52.190 --> 15:53.456
You're not in a position
to negotiate with me.

15:53.458 --> 15:54.690
You're wanted by the police

15:54.692 --> 15:55.691
and if you want to
see meilu again,

15:55.693 --> 15:57.159
you'll do what I say.

15:57.161 --> 15:59.595
- And how do I know you haven't
already killed her?

15:59.597 --> 16:01.664
- Okay, fabien,
your friends can stay here

16:01.666 --> 16:03.766
and watch the money
while you come for meilu.

16:03.768 --> 16:05.901
<i>Then you can call them</i>
<i>when you have meilu</i>

16:05.903 --> 16:08.471
<i>and then you can leave</i>
<i>the money behind.</i>

16:08.473 --> 16:11.574
<i>Now get back into the car</i>
<i>and keep the first cell phone.</i>

16:12.844 --> 16:14.510
- Shit.

16:14.512 --> 16:15.678
- Don't give the money
to anybody

16:15.680 --> 16:17.580
before you talk to me, okay?

16:17.582 --> 16:18.747
- We won't.
- And be careful.

16:18.749 --> 16:20.483
- Here, take the gun.

16:20.485 --> 16:21.484
- Keep it just in case.

16:21.486 --> 16:22.818
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.220
- Be careful.

16:24.222 --> 16:25.222
- I don't like how

16:25.223 --> 16:26.622
this is getting worse.

16:38.903 --> 16:40.669
<i> Go to the church</i>

16:40.671 --> 16:43.005
<i>at 1711 west avenue street</i>
<i>and hollywood.</i>

16:43.007 --> 16:44.874
- A church?

16:44.876 --> 16:46.942
<i> Yeah, I thought you might</i>
<i>want to confess to your crime.</i>

16:46.944 --> 16:48.911
- Fuck you.

16:51.215 --> 16:53.148
- This doesn't feel right.

16:53.150 --> 16:54.216
- What do you suggest we do?

16:54.218 --> 16:55.651
- There's nothing to do.

16:55.653 --> 16:56.752
We have to wait
to hear from him.

16:56.754 --> 16:57.820
That's it.

17:34.325 --> 17:35.724
- Okay, I'm here.

17:41.666 --> 17:45.234
- Sorry, jesus,
but I have to kill this man.

17:47.772 --> 17:51.941
- Welcome to the house of god.

17:51.943 --> 17:54.310
- Is the guy on the phone?

17:54.312 --> 17:55.978
- No, I don't think so.

18:01.752 --> 18:03.686
- Where's meilu?

18:03.688 --> 18:07.256
- You know, it's gonna be
easier than I thought.

18:08.659 --> 18:10.726
Hey, turn on that camera.

18:13.598 --> 18:15.331
- What is this bullshit?
Where's my girl?

18:15.333 --> 18:16.632
- Your girl?

18:18.936 --> 18:20.002
Hey, padre.

18:21.639 --> 18:23.339
- Shame on you.

18:23.341 --> 18:25.674
- What the hell did you do
to his girl?

18:25.676 --> 18:27.643
- Why are you doing this?

18:31.616 --> 18:33.182
- Congratulations, fabien.

18:33.184 --> 18:35.217
You've been chosen to star
as the lead in my new film.

18:35.219 --> 18:36.986
- What the hell
are you talking about?

18:36.988 --> 18:40.122
- You and your z team pals
came to hollywood with a dream.

18:40.124 --> 18:41.790
<i>Now you're gonna become famous</i>

18:41.792 --> 18:44.326
<i>but you, fabien,</i>
<i>you're gonna be my star.</i>

18:44.328 --> 18:47.329
<i>That is</i>
<i>if you survive scene 72.</i>

18:47.331 --> 18:49.798
- Give me meilu
and we give you your money.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.333
- You know, I don't care
about the money.

18:51.335 --> 18:53.702
That part is already done.
It's all about the film.

18:53.704 --> 18:54.937
And if you want to
see meilu again,

18:54.939 --> 18:56.205
then just finish my film.

18:56.207 --> 18:58.941
Play your part and survive.

18:58.943 --> 19:01.644
- I'm a good shepherd
and I will do as you command.

19:01.646 --> 19:02.711
Amen.

19:05.416 --> 19:07.249
- What do you want from me?

19:09.754 --> 19:10.919
<i>Tell me.</i>

19:11.889 --> 19:15.357
- Do you believe in god?

19:19.430 --> 19:21.664
'Cause he is watching you.

19:41.952 --> 19:43.719
My angels...

19:44.455 --> 19:45.821
Kick his ass.

19:47.992 --> 19:50.072
<i>Come on, boys,</i>
<i>show him the way it's done.</i>

19:51.929 --> 19:52.995
<i>Come on.</i>

19:54.231 --> 19:55.364
<i>Damn it.</i>

19:57.234 --> 19:58.801
<i>Get him!</i>

19:58.803 --> 20:00.936
<i>You, c'mon, c'mon,</i>
<i>c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.</i>

20:03.407 --> 20:05.474
<i>Wake up and fight, come on!</i>

20:07.411 --> 20:08.944
<i>Come on, come on, attack!</i>

20:08.946 --> 20:11.747
<i>Argh, come on.</i>

20:13.751 --> 20:15.217
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

20:15.219 --> 20:17.753
<i>And kick his ass,</i>
<i>come on, kick his ass.</i>

20:19.323 --> 20:20.389
Kick his ass!

20:24.428 --> 20:27.262
Argh, I need to do
everything myself.

21:18.549 --> 21:20.382
- Where is she?

21:20.384 --> 21:23.018
- Who?
- Meilu.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.320
- I don't know.

21:26.490 --> 21:28.090
We were just doing this
for the money.

21:28.092 --> 21:29.825
<i> What money?</i>

21:29.827 --> 21:32.795
- We were paid to fight you
for a movie, that's all.

21:39.870 --> 21:41.236
- Thank you, my son.

21:41.238 --> 21:43.806
Oh god, thank you.

21:43.808 --> 21:44.873
- Go phone the police.

21:44.875 --> 21:46.208
- You're a hero.

21:50.481 --> 21:52.815
<i> Well done.</i>
<i>You truly are a star.</i>

21:52.817 --> 21:54.249
- I'm going to kill you.

21:54.251 --> 21:56.185
<i> Stop whining.</i>
<i>You should be happy.</i>

21:56.187 --> 21:57.286
You wanted to be famous.

21:57.288 --> 21:58.887
Now you're gonna get your wish.

21:58.889 --> 22:00.589
If we finish my film
and you survive,

22:00.591 --> 22:02.858
<i>you'll be the newest</i>
<i>action star.</i>

22:02.860 --> 22:04.293
<i>But I have to warn you,</i>

22:04.295 --> 22:05.294
<i>the scenes are only</i>
<i>gonna get tougher.</i>

22:05.296 --> 22:06.962
- You know what?

22:06.964 --> 22:10.232
I'm gonna find meilu
and then I'm gonna find you.

22:10.234 --> 22:12.334
And then I'm gonna kill you.

22:12.336 --> 22:14.436
- If you survive,
you'll find your girl

22:14.438 --> 22:16.371
at the end of the film
and a happy ending.

22:16.373 --> 22:18.240
<i>But if you don't survive,</i>
<i>then neither will she.</i>

22:18.242 --> 22:19.942
- You're sick.

22:19.944 --> 22:23.245
- You have seven minutes
to get to the karate dojo

22:23.247 --> 22:25.514
at the corner of
hewitt and wilshire.

22:34.325 --> 22:36.391
- So how long are we
supposed to wait here?

22:36.393 --> 22:37.393
- What do you want to do?

22:37.394 --> 22:38.961
- Look, nothing's changed.

22:38.963 --> 22:39.962
We wait to hear from fabien.

22:39.964 --> 22:41.396
Hang on tight to this money

22:41.398 --> 22:44.266
because it's our only ticket
out of this mess.

22:45.636 --> 22:47.336
- You know, I really think
we should reconsider

22:47.338 --> 22:49.371
going to the police.

22:49.373 --> 22:50.873
Come on.

22:54.612 --> 22:55.878
- What is it?

23:01.986 --> 23:04.519
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Move, go, go.

23:04.521 --> 23:05.654
- Go, go, go.

23:20.271 --> 23:21.403
- What do we do?

23:33.584 --> 23:35.250
- You're surrounded.

23:35.252 --> 23:38.520
You have one minute
to come out with your hands up.

23:38.522 --> 23:40.322
- Shit.

23:40.324 --> 23:41.957
- Come on,
let's get out of here.

23:41.959 --> 23:42.958
Come on.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.293
- Hey, hold on, hold on.

23:44.295 --> 23:45.394
- Hello? Fabien?

23:45.396 --> 23:46.595
- Okay, you're surrounded.

23:46.597 --> 23:48.063
Just don't panic
and do as I say.

23:48.065 --> 23:50.232
- Where are meilu and fabien?

23:50.234 --> 23:52.234
<i> They'll be fine as</i>
<i>long as</i>
<i>you escape with my money.</i>

23:52.236 --> 23:53.702
- They are coming in...

23:56.640 --> 23:57.973
But there is nowhere to escape.

23:57.975 --> 23:59.207
It's a freakin' circus
out there.

23:59.209 --> 24:00.509
- Okay, I can see everything.

24:00.511 --> 24:02.611
Just trust me
and I'll get you out alive.

24:02.613 --> 24:03.679
- What does he want?

24:09.253 --> 24:10.419
<i>- Go, go, go, go, go.</i>
- They're coming in.

24:10.421 --> 24:12.181
Take a right and start to run.

24:19.330 --> 24:20.429
<i>Turn left.</i>

24:28.572 --> 24:30.505
- Now what?
- Okay, wait.

24:35.746 --> 24:36.979
Okay, go now.

24:36.981 --> 24:38.046
- Go.

24:40.417 --> 24:42.057
<i> Turn right.</i>

24:45.723 --> 24:46.989
<i>Don't move.</i>

24:54.598 --> 24:57.099
<i>One man's gonna enter.</i>
<i>Get ready to fight.</i>

25:36.040 --> 25:38.673
- Freeze! Get up slow.

25:38.675 --> 25:40.742
I said, "get up."

25:40.744 --> 25:42.411
Get up.

25:42.413 --> 25:43.478
Slowly.

25:53.824 --> 25:55.490
- Hey, it's alright.
Just calm down.

25:55.492 --> 25:56.625
We can go.

25:56.627 --> 25:59.394
Get the phone.

25:59.396 --> 26:01.363
<i>- Turn right.</i>
- Come on.

26:07.471 --> 26:09.471
<i> Wait!</i>

26:09.473 --> 26:10.672
<i>They're coming from</i>
<i>over there too.</i>

26:10.674 --> 26:11.807
<i> Hide.</i>

26:11.809 --> 26:14.142
- Fuck. They're coming. Hide.

26:31.728 --> 26:33.562
- Freeze! Let him go.

26:33.564 --> 26:34.863
Let him go now.

26:38.569 --> 26:40.469
Come on. Come on.

26:47.411 --> 26:49.444
- They're right behind you.
Run faster.

26:49.446 --> 26:50.512
- Faster.

27:20.644 --> 27:22.711
<i> Take the tunnel</i>
<i>on your right.</i>

27:22.713 --> 27:24.412
- There's a tunnel
on the right.

27:24.414 --> 27:27.449
- Right here, come here,
come here, let's go.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.694
<i> Almost out.</i>
<i>They're coming from upstairs.</i>

27:39.696 --> 27:41.530
<i>Hide until they leave.</i>

27:41.532 --> 27:43.431
- They're coming from upstairs.

28:17.834 --> 28:20.535
- Freeze! Don't move.

28:20.537 --> 28:22.370
Put your hands in the air.

28:39.823 --> 28:41.556
<i> Good. Very good.</i>

28:41.558 --> 28:43.391
<i>So go upstairs, take the door</i>
<i>and you're out.</i>

28:44.695 --> 28:46.361
- The exit's upstairs.
- Here, take these.

28:46.363 --> 28:47.762
- I am not gonna use this.

28:47.764 --> 28:49.464
- Look, we don't know how
this is gonna end up.

28:49.466 --> 28:50.832
But I prefer to be the one
with the guns this time.

28:50.834 --> 28:53.501
- Yeah, you're right.

28:54.705 --> 28:56.404
- Come on, let's go.

29:02.312 --> 29:03.378
- Come on.

29:09.586 --> 29:11.019
<i> Bravo.</i>

29:11.021 --> 29:12.754
<i>Brilliant escape</i>
<i>without a single shot.</i>

29:12.756 --> 29:13.788
<i>You know, you're much better</i>
<i>than I expected.</i>

29:13.790 --> 29:15.290
- What?

29:15.292 --> 29:16.625
- What's he saying,
what's he saying?

29:16.627 --> 29:18.393
<i>As I explained to fabien,</i>

29:18.395 --> 29:21.429
<i>the four of you are</i>
<i>the stars of my new movie.</i>

29:21.431 --> 29:23.732
<i>Fame and fortune</i>
<i>are at your fingertips, boys.</i>

29:23.734 --> 29:26.434
- Oh, yeah? How is that?

29:26.436 --> 29:29.704
<i> You heard me.</i>
<i>Smile, movie stars.</i>

29:29.706 --> 29:31.740
<i>The police are still after you.</i>

29:31.742 --> 29:33.775
<i>There's a gray car</i>
<i>right in front of you.</i>

29:33.777 --> 29:35.977
<i>Take it.</i>
<i>The key is in the ignition.</i>

29:35.979 --> 29:37.545
- How'd he tape everything?

29:37.547 --> 29:39.314
<i> Of course I did.</i>
<i>It's a film.</i>

29:39.316 --> 29:40.849
<i>You have eight minutes</i>
<i>to bring the money</i>

29:40.851 --> 29:43.451
<i>to the old paper factory</i>
<i>at the 25th street.</i>

29:43.453 --> 29:44.619
- What? Hey, wait.

29:44.621 --> 29:45.787
Wait!

29:45.789 --> 29:47.889
It's like we are rats
in his maze.

29:47.891 --> 29:49.391
- C'mon, hurry, let's go.
- Shit!

29:49.393 --> 29:51.426
- Come on, come on.

30:27.898 --> 30:28.930
- Hello.

30:28.932 --> 30:30.665
- There is no phones in here.

30:33.937 --> 30:35.538
<i> Remember,</i>
<i>"enter the dragon"?</i>

30:37.107 --> 30:38.873
<i>All good martial arts films</i>

30:38.875 --> 30:42.477
<i>have their heroes</i>
<i>fight multiple black belts.</i>

30:42.479 --> 30:43.878
- You sick fuck. This is real.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.380
The film is choreographed.

30:45.382 --> 30:47.449
<i>Reality tv?</i>

30:47.451 --> 30:49.117
<i>This is a reality film.</i>

30:49.119 --> 30:51.786
Succeed in your role and
all your dreams will come true.

30:53.690 --> 30:55.523
- You better not hurt her.

30:55.525 --> 30:56.891
- Worry less about meilu

30:56.893 --> 30:59.527
and concern yourself more
with my film.

30:59.529 --> 31:01.396
<i>Now I want to see</i>
<i>lots of action.</i>

31:01.398 --> 31:02.731
- And how do I do that?

31:02.733 --> 31:04.933
<i> Improvise.</i>
<i>You're an actor.</i>

31:08.805 --> 31:09.938
- Great.

31:12.743 --> 31:15.477
Are you sure of the address?

31:15.479 --> 31:16.911
I don't know. I think I am.

31:16.913 --> 31:18.780
Let me ask them.

31:18.782 --> 31:20.815
- Where the hell
do you think you are?

31:20.817 --> 31:22.384
- I'm looking for a dojo.

31:22.386 --> 31:23.685
Am I in the wrong place?

31:23.687 --> 31:26.788
This looks like a dance studio.

31:29.459 --> 31:31.393
- Get out of here.

31:31.395 --> 31:33.595
- But I didn't get
my dance lesson yet.

31:33.597 --> 31:35.597
- Are you crazy?

31:35.599 --> 31:38.500
Get the hell out of here
before I break your face.

31:39.836 --> 31:41.936
- Take your best shot, asshole.

31:48.145 --> 31:49.911
- You want a lesson?

31:49.913 --> 31:51.746
I'll give you a lesson alright.

32:39.629 --> 32:41.529
What are you waiting for?

33:34.885 --> 33:36.518
<i> Bravo.</i>

33:36.520 --> 33:37.619
<i>Impressive.</i>

33:37.621 --> 33:39.621
- I'm done. Where's meilu?

33:39.623 --> 33:41.689
Dojo
<i>compton avenue and central.</i>

33:49.266 --> 33:50.865
- He gave you everything?

33:50.867 --> 33:51.966
- Yes.

33:57.841 --> 33:59.574
- Very nice.

34:07.117 --> 34:09.317
Yes?

34:09.319 --> 34:12.654
<i> They'll be here any</i>
<i>minute with the rest</i>
<i>of your money.</i>

34:12.656 --> 34:14.621
- Alright.

34:14.623 --> 34:16.291
But let me ask you something.

34:17.860 --> 34:20.762
What did these men do to you?

34:20.764 --> 34:22.797
Why do you want them dead
so badly?

34:23.967 --> 34:25.768
<i> It's in the script.</i>

34:29.906 --> 34:32.306
- Script?

34:32.309 --> 34:34.309
The script.

34:34.311 --> 34:36.578
What fucking script?

34:41.650 --> 34:42.817
- I think it's here.

34:43.753 --> 34:45.018
- What is this place?

34:56.967 --> 34:58.600
- So what now?

35:05.175 --> 35:06.174
- It's not open.

35:06.176 --> 35:07.241
- Great.

35:11.181 --> 35:13.982
- Scene 74, interior
paper factory.

35:13.984 --> 35:15.650
<i>Like all the other scenes,</i>

35:15.652 --> 35:18.653
<i>the place is full of</i>
<i>hd surveillance cameras.</i>

35:18.655 --> 35:20.755
<i>This scene is like</i>
"gunfight at the ok corral."

35:20.757 --> 35:22.223
- A gunfight?

35:22.225 --> 35:24.926
- Inside there, are several men
expecting my money.

35:24.928 --> 35:26.661
Don't give it to them.

35:26.663 --> 35:29.397
- What? We can't keep fighting
guys for your amusement, okay?

35:29.399 --> 35:31.666
Just take the money
and let fabien and meilu go.

35:31.668 --> 35:34.769
<i> If you lose the</i>
<i>money,</i>
<i>you lose them.</i>

35:34.771 --> 35:36.337
<i>It's a simple scene.</i>
<i>Kill or be killed.</i>

35:36.339 --> 35:39.674
- Hey, we're actors,
not professional killers.

35:39.676 --> 35:40.908
- So act like a killer.

35:40.910 --> 35:41.909
And action.

35:41.911 --> 35:42.910
- We are dead.
- Don't worry.

35:42.912 --> 35:44.045
We'll find another way out.

35:44.047 --> 35:45.813
- No, no, no. Wait.
- What?

35:45.815 --> 35:48.383
- You were in the army before
so tell me how to use this.

35:54.224 --> 35:55.356
- Here.

35:56.660 --> 35:59.260
- Right. Safety's off.

35:59.262 --> 36:01.696
Cock it back.

36:01.698 --> 36:04.332
And then you point and shoot.

36:04.334 --> 36:05.433
You got it?

36:05.435 --> 36:06.701
- Yeah, I guess.
- Alright.

36:06.703 --> 36:07.869
C'mon, follow me.

36:20.884 --> 36:22.250
- There is no one here.

36:25.955 --> 36:26.954
- Look out!

36:28.224 --> 36:29.257
- Shit, stop!

36:29.259 --> 36:30.692
Don't shoot.

36:30.694 --> 36:32.574
- We don't need to
kill each other.

36:35.999 --> 36:38.266
- Okay.

36:38.268 --> 36:40.301
Then why don't you go ahead

36:40.303 --> 36:42.336
and hand over that money
you got there?

36:42.338 --> 36:44.405
- I'm sorry, we can't do that.

36:46.409 --> 36:47.842
- T.

36:51.781 --> 36:53.948
Well, then.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.217
It looks like
you're going to fucking die.

36:56.219 --> 36:57.485
- Hey, we're armed too.

36:57.487 --> 36:59.987
This is gonna end real bad
for all of us.

37:04.994 --> 37:07.795
- There are only three of you

37:07.797 --> 37:10.431
and there are many more of us.

37:10.433 --> 37:12.266
- So what do we do?
- We have no choice.

37:12.268 --> 37:14.435
We have to fight for fabien.

37:15.805 --> 37:16.938
- Shit.

37:26.816 --> 37:28.657
- Stay here with
your brother. Go!

38:10.927 --> 38:12.326
- Damn it.

38:16.299 --> 38:17.498
- Stay here and cover me.

38:31.214 --> 38:33.848
- You wanted a show?
Here you go.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.914
- Hey! You listen up.

39:42.485 --> 39:45.253
You hand over that money
right now

39:45.255 --> 39:47.021
and I let you walk out of here.

39:47.023 --> 39:50.358
I don't care about the guy.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.226
I just want my money.

39:52.228 --> 39:53.461
- You want it?

39:53.463 --> 39:54.562
Come and get it.

39:54.564 --> 39:56.931
- Hey, you're already injured.

39:56.933 --> 39:59.300
Yeah, I got you once,
motherfucker.

39:59.302 --> 40:03.537
You will die here
if you don't give me my money.

40:03.539 --> 40:05.273
- If I give you the money,

40:05.275 --> 40:07.541
another friend of mine
and his wife will die.

40:07.543 --> 40:09.543
And I can't let that happen.

40:13.383 --> 40:18.419
- I'm going to give you
one more chance and that's it.

40:20.023 --> 40:22.056
Do you surrender?

40:28.364 --> 40:30.331
I guess that means no.

40:47.383 --> 40:48.449
- Go.

40:49.652 --> 40:50.985
I said go.

40:50.987 --> 40:52.586
Cut his fucking head off.

41:19.382 --> 41:20.982
- Drop it.

41:20.984 --> 41:22.683
That's it, nice and slow.

41:25.989 --> 41:27.521
Alright, stand up.

41:28.458 --> 41:29.523
Turn around.

41:37.333 --> 41:38.666
<i> Stupid bitch.</i>

41:41.504 --> 41:45.006
C'mon, I'm gonna crush you
like a bug.

41:45.008 --> 41:46.474
<i>C'mon!</i>

41:46.476 --> 41:47.675
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:06.696 --> 42:09.063
- Didier, get down!

42:22.345 --> 42:23.411
No!

42:25.048 --> 42:27.648
<i> Jess! Jess, jess.</i>

42:32.422 --> 42:33.487
- Jess, no!

42:34.557 --> 42:38.592
Jess, jess, jess.

42:46.369 --> 42:48.402
<i> You'll be okay, jess.</i>

42:49.672 --> 42:50.805
- No.

42:50.807 --> 42:51.806
- Are you okay?

42:51.808 --> 42:52.807
- Jess.

42:52.809 --> 42:54.275
- I've been better.

42:54.277 --> 42:55.677
- You'll be okay.
We go to hospital.

42:55.678 --> 42:57.511
- No, no, I'm gonna stay here.

42:57.513 --> 42:59.280
He'll kill fabien and meilu
if we leave.

42:59.282 --> 43:01.315
It's gonna be too late,
by the time...

43:02.518 --> 43:05.319
- Jess.
- Jess.

43:05.321 --> 43:07.655
- No, just save
fabien and meilu.

43:07.657 --> 43:09.757
- We can't let you
die like this.

43:09.759 --> 43:11.358
Jess.

43:19.769 --> 43:21.702
No, no, not yet.

43:22.805 --> 43:24.405
Jess.

43:24.407 --> 43:26.740
You're not dead yet.

43:26.742 --> 43:28.509
Jess.

43:28.511 --> 43:31.445
Wake up, jess.

43:53.836 --> 43:55.703
- You piece of shit.

44:00.276 --> 44:01.809
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

44:01.811 --> 44:03.811
<i>Forever through his</i>

44:03.813 --> 44:05.813
<i>performance in my film.</i>

44:05.815 --> 44:07.615
- I'm gonna find you...

44:09.552 --> 44:11.418
And I promise you.

44:11.420 --> 44:12.820
<i>Chase me or save your friends,</i>

44:12.822 --> 44:14.588
<i>it's your choice.</i>

44:14.590 --> 44:18.425
<i>Corner of ninth street</i>
<i>and belmont, number 455,</i>

44:18.427 --> 44:19.693
<i>you have eight minutes.</i>

44:19.695 --> 44:21.462
<i>Ask for chan.</i>

44:25.668 --> 44:27.501
<i> Hello?</i>

44:27.503 --> 44:29.570
<i> Just to your right</i>
<i>between the two dumpsters,</i>

44:29.572 --> 44:30.571
<i>there's a bag.</i>

44:30.573 --> 44:31.672
<i>Open it.</i>

44:56.832 --> 44:59.567
<i>Strap the camera to your head.</i>

45:08.377 --> 45:09.777
<i>Drink the bottle.</i>

45:09.779 --> 45:12.546
- You know everything
so you know I don't drink.

45:12.548 --> 45:14.648
<i> I'm not asking.</i>
<i>Now drink.</i>

45:25.861 --> 45:28.829
- Aghh!

45:28.831 --> 45:30.998
<i> Now you're gonna go</i>
<i>across compton avenue</i>

45:31.000 --> 45:32.266
<i>down to 100 street.</i>

45:32.268 --> 45:33.701
- You're crazy.

45:33.703 --> 45:36.837
That's one of the most
dangerous areas of los angeles.

45:36.839 --> 45:38.672
<i>Our film can't be any good</i>

45:38.674 --> 45:40.841
<i>if there isn't</i>
<i>a sense of danger.</i>

45:40.843 --> 45:42.810
- You just want me dead,
you sick fuck.

45:42.812 --> 45:44.878
<i>Stop talking or she dies.</i>

45:44.880 --> 45:47.615
<i>Now finish that bottle.</i>

45:58.728 --> 45:59.860
- What the hell?

45:59.862 --> 46:03.297
Hey, man check this shit out.

46:03.299 --> 46:04.699
- You looking for a cave,
white boy?

46:04.700 --> 46:06.600
- Yo, he must be lost
or something

46:06.602 --> 46:08.502
- yo, where you goin',
snow white?

46:10.539 --> 46:12.573
- 'Scuse me, motherfucker,
I'm talkin' to you.

46:12.575 --> 46:13.674
- Oh, pussy-ass white boy.

46:13.676 --> 46:15.309
- Oh hell no, motherfucker.

46:15.311 --> 46:16.910
<i> Oh shit.</i>

46:16.912 --> 46:19.546
<i> Get the car,</i>

<i>Where do you think you going?</i>
<i>He can't run from us.</i>

- I'm talkin' to you.

46:53.482 --> 46:54.515
Where d'you think
you're goin', man?

46:54.517 --> 46:55.783
- C'mon, white boy.

46:55.785 --> 46:57.685
You in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

46:57.687 --> 46:58.919
- ...that thing on your head.

46:58.921 --> 46:59.953
You gotta pay the tax fool.

46:59.955 --> 47:01.021
<i> I'm sorry, man.</i>

47:01.023 --> 47:02.423
- You sorry?

47:02.425 --> 47:03.724
- Got to give me
something, man.

47:03.726 --> 47:04.858
You gotta give me
something, come on.

47:04.860 --> 47:05.859
- Come on white boy.

47:11.434 --> 47:12.733
- Shut the fuck up,
white boy, for real.

47:12.735 --> 47:14.468
- You think you tough?
- Back up that shit.

47:14.470 --> 47:15.703
Let me count that shit.

47:19.875 --> 47:21.709
- What else you got?
What else you got?

47:24.347 --> 47:25.846
- $10, man? C'mon.

47:25.848 --> 47:27.581
You gotta have something
more than this, man, come on.

47:27.583 --> 47:29.917
- Are you fuckin' broke?
- C'mon, what else you got?

47:30.920 --> 47:31.952
- Give me this shit, cuz.

47:31.954 --> 47:33.587
- Gimme that.

47:33.589 --> 47:34.655
<i> Sorry, I can't.</i>

47:34.657 --> 47:35.923
- Sorry, what?

47:35.925 --> 47:36.990
- What the fuck you mean,
you can't?

47:36.992 --> 47:38.492
Give it to him, man.

47:38.494 --> 47:40.594
- Sorry, I think you can.
- Oh, shit.

47:40.596 --> 47:41.729
- Ha, ha.

47:41.731 --> 47:42.796
- Shit.

47:44.533 --> 47:46.173
<i> Shoot 'Im.</i>

47:50.139 --> 47:52.473
- Oh, shit, man.

47:52.475 --> 47:53.540
- He's fast.

47:55.144 --> 47:57.745
Can you shoot, bruce lee? Hm?

47:57.747 --> 47:58.912
Come on, man.

47:58.914 --> 48:00.647
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

48:01.617 --> 48:02.750
- Man, put that gun down.

48:02.752 --> 48:03.817
- What's up, man.

48:07.857 --> 48:09.556
<i> Get him before</i>

48:09.558 --> 48:10.858
<i>he goes anywhere.</i>

48:10.860 --> 48:12.459
<i>Get him before he turns us off.</i>

48:12.461 --> 48:13.927
<i>- We can get him</i>
<i>on the straightway.</i>

48:13.929 --> 48:14.928
<i> Turn right.</i>

48:16.565 --> 48:18.565
<i> Oh, man.</i>

48:18.567 --> 48:20.527
<i> Turn left</i>
<i>on the next street.</i>

48:23.873 --> 48:25.472
<i>Turn left through the gate.</i>

48:30.780 --> 48:32.479
<i> Now what?</i>

48:32.481 --> 48:34.148
<i> Enter through</i>
<i>the door on the left.</i>

48:34.150 --> 48:35.951
<i> Hurry up, hurry up.</i>

48:54.870 --> 48:57.871
- You fuck!
You led me into a trap again.

48:57.873 --> 49:00.574
- Exactly.

49:00.576 --> 49:03.477
<i>- White boy, I know you in</i>
<i>there, open this door, now.</i>

49:03.479 --> 49:05.399
<i>Now take off the camera.</i>

49:11.654 --> 49:13.187
- I'm guessing.

49:13.189 --> 49:15.756
They're coming after me
and I have to beat them all up.

49:15.758 --> 49:17.791
- Oh, wow,
you're getting smart.

49:17.793 --> 49:18.826
- I've got to tell you.

49:18.828 --> 49:20.227
From a creative point of view,

49:20.229 --> 49:22.162
your scenes
are getting redundant,

49:22.164 --> 49:24.164
kind of boring actually.

49:24.166 --> 49:26.233
- Yeah, nonsense.
You know, voyeurism,

49:26.235 --> 49:29.636
abduction, bank robbery,
fights to the death...

49:29.638 --> 49:31.472
- Death? Who died?

49:31.474 --> 49:33.140
- Nobody yet,
but maybe it'll be you.

49:33.142 --> 49:34.608
- Fuck you.

49:34.610 --> 49:35.809
- In this scene,
I want a traditional

49:35.811 --> 49:37.845
Hong kong kung fu-style fight,

49:37.847 --> 49:41.014
the drunken style which
every kung fu expert masters.

49:41.016 --> 49:42.749
- Are you crazy?

49:42.751 --> 49:45.853
The drunken fist is more
for show than anything else.

49:45.855 --> 49:47.721
I will get myself killed.

49:50.226 --> 49:51.092
- Alright, wait.

49:51.093 --> 49:51.959
I have it right here
in front of me.

49:51.961 --> 49:54.695
Yep, scene 110,
hero enters warehouse

49:54.697 --> 49:56.763
and fights for his life
and the life of his woman

49:56.765 --> 49:59.233
using traditional
kung fu drunken style.

49:59.235 --> 50:01.668
Sorry, it's got to be
drunken style kung fu.

50:02.838 --> 50:04.805
- You're really
out of your mind.

50:10.246 --> 50:12.579
- Alright, here they come.
Good luck.

50:16.719 --> 50:18.151
- There you go.

50:18.153 --> 50:19.920
Fuck this white boy up.

50:19.922 --> 50:22.256
- Now let's get
this motherfucker.

50:34.904 --> 50:37.237
- I know a drunken style.

50:42.311 --> 50:43.777
- Oh, shit!

51:14.176 --> 51:15.709
- Gonna cut your ass up.

51:19.848 --> 51:21.048
- Shit!

51:49.878 --> 51:51.598
<i> What the fuck?</i>

51:57.720 --> 52:00.187
I'm kind of busy.
Don't you see?

52:00.189 --> 52:03.190
- Okay, change of plan.
Kill them.

52:03.192 --> 52:04.891
- What? No.

52:04.893 --> 52:07.694
- Fine. Movie ends
and meilu dies.

52:16.839 --> 52:18.271
- You man, get up.

52:20.743 --> 52:21.975
I said, "get up."

52:24.313 --> 52:26.880
<i>You know what, man?</i>

52:26.882 --> 52:30.817
When this is over,
after I kill you,

52:30.819 --> 52:33.887
I'm gonna find
your little girlfriend

52:33.889 --> 52:36.023
and I'm gonna
make her my bitch.

52:37.860 --> 52:39.292
<i>Let's go.</i>

53:03.419 --> 53:04.951
<i> Shit!</i>

53:24.406 --> 53:26.306
- Shit. You broke my leg.

53:26.308 --> 53:27.441
But, fuck, just... c'mon, man.

53:27.443 --> 53:29.443
You don't have to do this shit.

53:29.445 --> 53:31.344
C'mon, man, shit, man.

53:31.346 --> 53:34.247
Just lemme go, alright?

53:34.249 --> 53:35.315
Just...

53:45.928 --> 53:48.361
Are you happy now?
Where is she?

53:56.739 --> 53:58.205
- What do you want?

54:15.491 --> 54:16.957
- Follow me.

54:54.496 --> 54:56.297
- You'll get this
on the way out.

55:37.539 --> 55:39.339
- You're mr. Chan?

55:39.341 --> 55:41.441
- You must be my actors.

55:41.443 --> 55:42.475
We've been expecting you.

55:42.477 --> 55:44.010
- What do you want?

55:47.349 --> 55:48.348
- You know,
I've been in this business

55:48.350 --> 55:49.482
a very long time.

55:50.986 --> 55:53.954
And I've met
some crazy motherfuckers.

55:53.956 --> 55:57.924
But your friend has got to be
the craziest of them all.

55:57.926 --> 55:59.426
- Who is he?

55:59.428 --> 56:03.930
- They call him "the filmmaker."
And yes, he is crazy.

56:03.932 --> 56:05.398
<i>But he does pay well.</i>

56:05.400 --> 56:06.633
I mean, he did give me
a lot of work

56:06.635 --> 56:09.436
installing all this equipment.

56:09.438 --> 56:10.678
<i>These cameras look familiar?</i>

56:12.341 --> 56:13.540
<i>Prepare their fights.</i>

56:15.477 --> 56:17.577
<i>Oh, and this.</i>

56:19.248 --> 56:21.314
<i>For the winner of the fights.</i>

56:21.316 --> 56:23.016
- What is this?

56:23.018 --> 56:25.652
- His instructions were simple.

56:25.654 --> 56:27.420
Install the equipment,

56:27.422 --> 56:29.956
have them fight the best
of the best fighters

56:29.958 --> 56:33.026
and, for the winner,
this envelope.

56:33.028 --> 56:34.628
- I'm tired of
this fucking game.

56:34.630 --> 56:36.630
Where is this guy,
the filmmaker?

56:36.632 --> 56:37.998
- Who knows?

56:38.934 --> 56:40.367
Behind the cameras?

56:43.538 --> 56:45.438
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.440
You have to win
your fights first.

56:52.281 --> 56:53.980
- Come on, you pussy.

56:53.982 --> 56:56.549
Bring your bitch ass over here.

56:59.254 --> 57:00.921
Come on, right now.

57:36.058 --> 57:38.124
- Nobody fuck with neutron!

58:21.269 --> 58:23.503
- This isn't a movie,
my friend.

58:23.505 --> 58:25.638
You and your brother
will die tonight.

01:01:16.778 --> 01:01:17.844
- I got it.

01:01:22.684 --> 01:01:24.817
- Noooo!

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:29.822
Didier.

01:01:35.297 --> 01:01:36.462
- You'll be fine.

01:01:40.402 --> 01:01:41.568
- It hurts.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:42.702
- I have to get you
to a hospital.

01:01:45.874 --> 01:01:46.873
- No.

01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:48.608
- You'll tire yourself.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:50.743
Come on right here

01:01:50.745 --> 01:01:52.545
and press down tight, okay?

01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:53.646
I'm going for help.

01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:56.883
Stop talking, relax.

01:01:56.885 --> 01:01:59.419
- Just in case...

01:01:59.421 --> 01:02:00.453
- What?

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:03.590
- I just wanted to tell you...

01:02:05.293 --> 01:02:06.859
- Didier.

01:02:06.861 --> 01:02:08.494
Didier.

01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:11.531
Didier.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.506
Didier!

01:02:22.911 --> 01:02:25.545
Noooo!

01:02:40.428 --> 01:02:42.395
- You've made it
to the final fight.

01:02:42.397 --> 01:02:44.797
If you win,
you'll see meilu again.

01:02:46.434 --> 01:02:48.301
- What do I have to do?

01:02:48.303 --> 01:02:50.223
<i>Just stay where you are.</i>

01:03:59.741 --> 01:04:01.741
Aghhh!

01:04:33.775 --> 01:04:35.875
- Now what?

01:04:35.877 --> 01:04:37.410
<i>Hello?</i>

01:04:37.412 --> 01:04:39.479
- Fabien?

01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:40.980
- Lohan, is that you?

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.717
- Yeah, it's me.

01:04:44.719 --> 01:04:46.486
- Is everything okay?

01:04:46.488 --> 01:04:48.454
<i>And how did you</i>
<i>get this number?</i>

01:04:49.858 --> 01:04:51.624
- Where are you?

01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:54.594
- I'm in a warehouse
next to compton and 100 street.

01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:56.763
He told me that my last thing
was right here.

01:04:56.765 --> 01:04:58.464
Are you guys okay?

01:05:00.802 --> 01:05:02.435
<i>Lohan, are you there?</i>

01:05:05.907 --> 01:05:06.973
- They are dead.

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:09.809
- What?

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.579
- It's just me, man.

01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:14.947
The others are dead.

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:25.958
That son of a bitch
hired thugs to kill us.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.829
<i>He switched suitcase</i>
<i>and used the money to pay them.</i>

01:05:29.831 --> 01:05:31.831
<i>We tried to fight them but...</i>

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:41.607
Look, doesn't matter now.

01:05:41.609 --> 01:05:42.842
I'm coming to you.

01:06:24.886 --> 01:06:27.687
- I can see that this hasn't
been any fun for you either.

01:06:40.268 --> 01:06:41.667
- All this is my fault.

01:06:41.669 --> 01:06:43.202
- It's not your fault.

01:06:43.204 --> 01:06:45.505
It's that bastard.

01:06:45.507 --> 01:06:46.672
I'm gonna kill him.

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.690
- I should have gone
to the police.

01:06:56.818 --> 01:06:58.858
- I'm covered with
jess and didier's blood.

01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:01.921
I have to kill
whoever killed them.

01:07:04.959 --> 01:07:07.226
- We're gonna find
that son of a bitch.

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.999
And once we've got meilu,
we make him pay.

01:07:15.169 --> 01:07:16.702
- What did he say exactly?

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.841
- He told me that I was
almost finished.

01:07:21.843 --> 01:07:24.777
And I will see meilu again
if I won my final fight.

01:07:30.985 --> 01:07:32.552
They paid you shit.

01:07:32.554 --> 01:07:34.820
- I'm coming for you.
You hear me?

01:07:34.822 --> 01:07:36.722
- I'm sending you a video.

01:07:38.226 --> 01:07:39.226
- What did he say?

01:07:39.227 --> 01:07:40.826
- He will send us a video.

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:03.349
- Fuck.

01:08:03.351 --> 01:08:05.718
Lily. Fuck!

01:08:10.925 --> 01:08:12.992
- Damn.

01:08:16.264 --> 01:08:17.697
- You bastard.

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:19.765
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out.

01:08:19.767 --> 01:08:21.600
Let my wife go.

01:08:21.603 --> 01:08:22.835
- So here's the deal.

01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:24.170
You two will fight to the death

01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:26.339
and whoever wins
gets the prize.

01:08:26.341 --> 01:08:27.907
- You sick piece of shit.

01:08:27.908 --> 01:08:29.207
- We won't do it.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.310
- If you don't fight,
I'm gonna dismember

01:08:31.312 --> 01:08:35.014
every part of their tight
beautiful little bodies.

01:08:43.256 --> 01:08:44.323
- Oh, fuck.

01:08:47.295 --> 01:08:51.197
Okay, let's play around
a bit to buy some time

01:08:51.198 --> 01:08:53.265
until we figure something out.

01:08:57.738 --> 01:08:59.337
Ready?

01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:12.818
Your phone.

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:17.189
<i> Why are you doing this?</i>

01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:19.191
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

01:09:19.193 --> 01:09:20.725
- Stop it.

01:09:20.728 --> 01:09:21.993
Stop it!

01:09:21.996 --> 01:09:23.328
- Are you gonna make me
cut them up

01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:24.930
or are you gonna fight?

01:09:48.456 --> 01:09:49.788
- Are you okay?

01:10:13.715 --> 01:10:15.881
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:10:54.255 --> 01:10:55.454
- Stop it.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.381
Nooo!

01:13:20.635 --> 01:13:22.334
I'm sorry.

01:13:48.362 --> 01:13:49.662
- Where is she?

01:13:49.664 --> 01:13:51.964
- That was the price of success.

01:13:53.567 --> 01:13:55.301
We'll meet at your place.

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:17.056
- Meilu?

01:14:55.763 --> 01:14:57.696
- It came in the mail for you.

01:14:57.698 --> 01:15:00.366
The word "gift"
was written on it.

01:15:00.368 --> 01:15:01.400
- No name?

01:15:01.402 --> 01:15:04.269
- No, just an address.

01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:05.604
- It's the price of success.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.484
- What you doing, fabien?

01:16:58.486 --> 01:16:59.618
Hm?

01:17:24.545 --> 01:17:29.481
- The filmmaker,
4400 seaton street.

01:17:50.504 --> 01:17:52.538
- It's gonna be a big hit,
fabien.

01:17:55.509 --> 01:17:56.608
- Where are meilu and lily?

01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:57.843
- I dunno.

01:17:57.845 --> 01:17:59.686
They're supposed
to be here, okay?

01:18:00.881 --> 01:18:02.347
- Are you crazy?

01:18:02.349 --> 01:18:03.582
If you don't tell me
where they are,

01:18:03.584 --> 01:18:04.850
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

01:18:04.852 --> 01:18:06.652
- I don't know where they're at,
alright?

01:18:06.654 --> 01:18:10.589
If it's about the fucking money
you can have it yourself, okay?

01:18:10.591 --> 01:18:13.358
- Where is she?
Where is she, you fuck?

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.793
- C'mon, man, I just
helped you make this film.

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:16.461
Man, come on.

01:18:16.463 --> 01:18:19.364
- Stop crying to me
and tell me where they are.

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:20.832
You hear me? You hear me?

01:18:20.834 --> 01:18:22.834
- You'll fucking kill me.

01:18:24.638 --> 01:18:26.405
I just followed your script.

01:18:26.407 --> 01:18:27.539
- What the fuck does that mean?

01:18:27.541 --> 01:18:28.607
- I just followed your script.

01:18:28.609 --> 01:18:29.641
- Where is she?

01:18:29.643 --> 01:18:30.909
- I just followed your script.

01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:46.358
- Ed, come on in.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360
Thanks for coming.

01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:48.493
- Yeah, my pleasure.

01:18:50.698 --> 01:18:53.298
- My new office.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.701
Sorry it's a mess but,
please, sit down.

01:18:55.703 --> 01:18:56.768
- Thank you.

01:19:01.575 --> 01:19:03.742
- So as I've told you
on the phone,

01:19:03.744 --> 01:19:07.312
I have a script that might be
of interest to you.

01:19:07.314 --> 01:19:09.681
- Where is she? Where is she?

01:19:09.683 --> 01:19:11.516
You hear me? Where is she?

01:19:13.887 --> 01:19:15.921
Where is she?

01:19:15.923 --> 01:19:16.922
- You know, this is risky.

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:18.590
I dunno, man.

01:19:18.592 --> 01:19:20.826
This is real shit here.

01:19:20.828 --> 01:19:23.795
- Listen,
you've lost everything.

01:19:23.797 --> 01:19:26.298
What else is there for you?

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.533
Think about the money.
You get a fortune too.

01:19:28.535 --> 01:19:30.602
- Okay, I think about the money
a lot, alright?

01:19:30.604 --> 01:19:32.337
But this is crazy.

01:19:32.339 --> 01:19:34.573
You understand we can go
to prison for a long time

01:19:34.575 --> 01:19:35.807
if this doesn't work out.

01:19:35.809 --> 01:19:37.476
- I take the risk.

01:19:37.478 --> 01:19:40.512
We'll never see your face.

01:19:40.514 --> 01:19:42.581
I give you 50% of the money
up front.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:46.585
The other half goes
to the other talents.

01:19:46.587 --> 01:19:48.353
- So you don't want
any of the money?

01:19:48.355 --> 01:19:50.196
- Just the movie's
enough for me.

01:19:53.427 --> 01:19:54.593
Where is she?

01:19:54.595 --> 01:19:55.727
Tell me.

01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:57.996
Hey, where is she?

01:20:06.774 --> 01:20:08.740
So what do you think?

01:20:08.742 --> 01:20:10.375
- It's excellent.

01:20:12.346 --> 01:20:14.646
But you know
you and your friends might die.

01:20:15.783 --> 01:20:17.582
- I'm doing it for them too.

01:20:17.584 --> 01:20:18.784
For all of us.

01:20:20.354 --> 01:20:23.455
It's our last chance
to make it here.

01:20:23.457 --> 01:20:27.926
Sometimes, one must be willing
to pay the price.

01:20:29.596 --> 01:20:30.896
Is that a problem?

01:20:30.898 --> 01:20:33.699
- No, not for me.

01:20:33.701 --> 01:20:34.766
But you know
it's highly unlikely

01:20:34.768 --> 01:20:36.468
it's gonna go as planned.

01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:39.871
- Believe me, just follow
the script and my notes

01:20:39.873 --> 01:20:41.940
and everything
will go as planned.

01:21:27.488 --> 01:21:29.855
<i> I've got good news</i>
<i>and bad news for you.</i>

01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:34.393
<i>The bad news is lohan is dead.</i>

01:21:36.597 --> 01:21:40.565
<i>But the good news is</i>
<i>he will be an action star.</i>

01:21:40.567 --> 01:21:42.467
<i>Don't be ungrateful.</i>

01:21:42.469 --> 01:21:44.436
<i>I gave him</i>
<i>what he always wanted.</i>

01:21:50.477 --> 01:21:53.412
<i>You see, I kept my promise.</i>

01:21:53.414 --> 01:21:55.614
<i>I made it.</i>

01:21:55.616 --> 01:21:57.549
<i>Just like I said I would.</i>

01:22:05.759 --> 01:22:07.592
- After countless hours
of editing,

01:22:07.594 --> 01:22:09.895
I finally finished my movie.

01:22:09.897 --> 01:22:11.830
If everything goes as planned,

01:22:11.832 --> 01:22:14.733
I'll be out of the country or,

01:22:14.735 --> 01:22:16.735
if you're lucky,
I might be the guy

01:22:16.737 --> 01:22:19.671
sitting next to you
in the theater.

01:22:22.576 --> 01:22:27.612
You might be wondering
"am I insane?"

01:22:27.614 --> 01:22:28.880
The answer is I don't know.

01:22:28.882 --> 01:22:30.816
I'd like to say, "no,"

01:22:30.818 --> 01:22:33.852
but does a crazy person
know if he's crazy?

01:22:33.854 --> 01:22:36.655
And... action.

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:39.825
<i>How far would you go</i>
<i>for success?</i>

01:22:41.595 --> 01:22:45.197
<i>How many people would you</i>
<i>cheat or steal from?</i>

01:22:45.199 --> 01:22:47.732
<i>Or even kill</i>
<i>to reach your goals?</i>

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:02.814
- Damn it, fabien,
you scared me.

01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:05.917
Why are you dressed like that?

01:23:05.919 --> 01:23:09.187
- I bet you're not
so different then.

01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:13.625
Success always comes
with a price tag.

01:23:13.627 --> 01:23:17.796
Extraordinary things
take extraordinary sacrifices.

01:23:21.835 --> 01:23:23.502
- Where have you been?

01:23:23.504 --> 01:23:24.803
I went to the bank today.

01:23:24.805 --> 01:23:27.272
Is there something
you want to tell me?

01:23:28.242 --> 01:23:29.708
According to the banker,

01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:32.944
you withdrew all of our money
last week.

01:23:32.946 --> 01:23:35.080
- It was gonna be a surprise.

01:23:35.082 --> 01:23:36.648
- Well, good surprise.

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:38.850
<i>What do you do</i>
<i>with all the money?</i>

01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:41.653
- I invested in a film.

01:23:41.655 --> 01:23:44.856
You told me that you were
sick of waiting.

01:23:44.858 --> 01:23:48.527
I'm in the process of
making my movie.

01:23:49.563 --> 01:23:50.662
- What?

01:23:55.302 --> 01:23:58.537
- We live in a world where
having talent and ambition

01:23:58.539 --> 01:23:59.804
isn't enough anymore.

01:24:02.643 --> 01:24:04.976
<i> Sorry, meilu,</i>
<i>i need you to scream.</i>

01:24:04.978 --> 01:24:06.845
- You are crazy.

01:24:08.248 --> 01:24:09.881
<i> Please scream.</i>

01:24:09.883 --> 01:24:11.650
- What?

01:24:11.652 --> 01:24:13.251
What?

01:24:13.253 --> 01:24:15.954
- People always told me
not to give up on my dream.

01:24:15.956 --> 01:24:17.622
"You're so talented.

01:24:17.624 --> 01:24:19.958
"Give it some time,
you will make it." Fuck you!

01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:26.264
It's much easier said
than done.

01:24:26.266 --> 01:24:28.700
I need to record you screaming.

01:24:28.702 --> 01:24:30.001
And crying.

01:24:31.305 --> 01:24:33.305
- Why are you doing this?

01:24:44.985 --> 01:24:46.585
- Thank you.

01:24:50.691 --> 01:24:52.791
I miss my friends

01:24:52.793 --> 01:24:58.630
but they wanted to be famous and
leave a mark in this world.

01:24:58.632 --> 01:25:01.366
It's just they didn't
want it as bad as me.

01:25:05.305 --> 01:25:08.039
I told you that one day
we would make a film together.

01:25:19.186 --> 01:25:20.385
Are you okay?

01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:24.322
How many are
there in this damn city

01:25:24.324 --> 01:25:26.658
trying to break
into the industry.

01:25:27.995 --> 01:25:30.729
Trying to make
their dreams come true.

01:25:35.936 --> 01:25:38.403
And how many of them
will succeed?

01:25:47.914 --> 01:25:51.783
Here is what it costs nowadays.

01:25:51.785 --> 01:25:55.920
That was the price
of my success.

01:26:11.338 --> 01:26:13.838
¶ is it worth it worth it ¶

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.209
¶ yeah why don't you

¶ when in a desk
where they sat me ¶

01:28:38.885 --> 01:28:41.920
¶ my life will lack purpose
if my heart denies truth ¶

01:28:41.922 --> 01:28:43.054
