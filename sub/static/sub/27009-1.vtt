00:22.272 --> 00:23.774
[gasps] He made those great burgers.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.694
He sure did.
He was funny. Always with the joke.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.112
[Bill] Where is he now?

00:29.196 --> 00:31.073
Blew his head off in '63.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.659
Oh. That's right.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.826
What was his name?

00:34.910 --> 00:35.953
I have no idea.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.663
God, I miss those burgers.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.059
Oh, Frank, you were so handsome.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.103
[Bill] Yeah. Nice glasses, Dad.

01:01.186 --> 01:04.398
You look like you took them from
Buddy Holly before they closed the casket.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.275
[all laugh]

01:06.358 --> 01:08.860
You're right, I do. Good one, Bill.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.071
Oh, my God, you look like Joe Morello.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.782
Who the fuck is Joe Morello?

01:14.366 --> 01:17.661
He's a jazz drummer for Dave Brubeck.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.329
He's legally blind with glasses.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.999
Legally,
your birth certificate says "ape."

Frank, honey, who was filming that?

01:40.851 --> 01:42.185
[Frank] Good old Goomer.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.188
We had some sweet times in those days.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.899
Oh, I fell in love
with that wallpaper pattern.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.693
Daffodil dreams. [gasps]

01:50.319 --> 01:52.571
I was going to do the whole room in it.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.615
And then baby Bill came along.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.159
So, I put it on hold for a bit.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.578
Mom, that was 12 years ago.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.086
That's not funny, Kevin.

-I should finish it now.
-No, no, honey.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.214
Sit down.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.468
I didn't finish the wallpaper.
I didn't finish college.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.886
I never finish anything.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.971
You finished that half gallon of ice cream
this morning.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.307
Good job, Kevin, you made your mother cry.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.433
You made her pregnant.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.227
Hey, that was a happy accident
like every goddamn one of you.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.813
Is that all I can do? Make babies?

02:26.897 --> 02:28.023
No!

02:28.106 --> 02:29.608
What about the Salad Tosser?

02:29.691 --> 02:34.237

It's on TV all the time.

Honey, honey, relax.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.874
Your new invention
is going to be even better.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.834
Just hope nobody steals that one.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.129
Kevin, will you shut up!
Honey, honey, don't cry.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.299
Let's watch the good times again.
See, look how happy we were.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.468
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.246
Oh, they grow up so fast.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.416
Yup. And then they marry an asshole
that you have to pretend to like.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.878
This seat is still saved,
get your eyes off it.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.214
Frank, relax, everything's fine.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.383
[Jim]
Here's the exquisite Henrietta Van Horne

09:52.467 --> 09:56.179
and her new invention that some are
calling bigger than the Bible,

09:56.262 --> 09:57.889
the Salad Tosser.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.641
Muah, muah.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.101
Thank you, Jim.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.978
Aw, I can still smell me on you.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.730
[laughs]

10:05.814 --> 10:07.190
-[microphone feedback]
-My wife is here.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.611
Henrietta was awarded "Woman of the Year"
by the Van Horne Foundation.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.864
She's truly an inspiration
to women everywhere.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.783
I bought one for every room.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.076
You're my hero.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.953
That should have been me
spinning up there.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.498
[sighs] I cannot take this anymore.
I am going to go pass out my flyers.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.709
Now, honey, you just said
you were having fun.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.086
So, relax.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.921
It's okay. The plan for today was--

10:30.004 --> 10:32.882
Can you please stop talking to me
like I just attempted suicide?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.801
-I'm not talking to you like--
-Yes, you are!

10:34.884 --> 10:36.219
"Just relax." "Just have fun."

10:36.302 --> 10:38.555
<i>I am relaxed, and I am having fun, okay?</i>

10:40.056 --> 10:43.268
How would you like to hear about
a new and exciting kitchen product?

10:43.351 --> 10:44.936
-[sighs]
-Thank God.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.479
The crazy pregnant lady's gone.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.648
Hey! Show some respect.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.692
That crazy pregnant lady's your mother.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.609
I'm gonna go find Bolo.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.445
You're going to need to find a new family
if you leave your post.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.531
Now slide over so we can hold
your mother's spot.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.449
Jesus, what's your problem?

10:58.533 --> 11:02.036
I'm looking at it. Now shut up
and sit the fuck down.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.371
Still saved.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.709
I'm so proud of you, Quincy.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.336
My little computer man.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.422
Mama works hard for you.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.383
[with emphasis] Real hard.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.676
Thank you, Mommy.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.137
I told you, baby.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.723
Mama don't kiss on the mouth.

11:22.807 --> 11:27.937
Suck jobs. Honor our war dead
with a suck job.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.607
Here I am, Mr. Kanicky.

11:30.690 --> 11:35.195
Ah, Maureen. I've got a very special spot
for you in the office of the future.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.154
Ready?

11:36.237 --> 11:39.073
I sure am. Put me up front and center.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.074
Here you go.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.912
Space secretary?

11:43.995 --> 11:47.123
The job of the future for smart non-men...

11:47.207 --> 11:49.042
and genetically enhanced dolphins.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.293
But no one will see me.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.337
Not with this on, they won't.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.341
Secretary in Space!

11:56.424 --> 12:00.303
And we honor those who made
the ultimate sacrifice for our country.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.014
All gave some. But some gave all.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.350
Who doesn't love the whimsy of the circus.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.477
The clowns. The popcorn.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.686
-For God's sake.
-[feedback]

12:08.770 --> 12:10.396
How am I supposed to go from dead soldiers

12:10.480 --> 12:12.899
to the fucking whimsy
of the fucking circus?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.192
Uh...

12:14.275 --> 12:18.780
Here are the delightful elephants
from the Diddling Brothers Circus.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.990
Hey, I know that shit shoveler.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.618
What's wrong with you, Goliath?
You've been stopping all day.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.037
This isn't playtime. Move it.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.664
[elephant trumpets]

12:27.747 --> 12:29.123
Easy big fella.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.125
-Ah!
-[crowd gasps]

12:32.460 --> 12:33.544
Free shit.

12:33.628 --> 12:37.048
Tell the ambulance driver I'm AB-negative.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.008
It's very rare.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.971
Let me introduce you to a new invention
that will revolutionize kitchenware.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.265
[Mrs. Pender] This is the Salad Tosser.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.058
I already own three of them.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.978
Oh, no. No. It's the Carrot Crisper.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.396
It's completely different.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.398
And anyway, I invented the Salad Tosser.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.818
Everyone knows that was
the great Henrietta Van Horne.

12:56.901 --> 13:01.239
And you should spend less time
begging for money and work on your figure.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.157
I'm not fat, I'm pregnant.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.994
Women die having babies at your age.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.495
Hide your shame.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.747
[drumroll]

13:13.710 --> 13:15.670
Hey, my Murphitos.

13:15.753 --> 13:16.879
Hey, Vic.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.550
[chuckles] This is crazy.
Everyone came out to watch me jog.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.801
It's a parade, Vic.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.013
You've got to take up jogging, Frank.
It's helping me stay clean.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.557
You got to keep running.
The demons are gaining on me.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.644
I guess you must have a lot of time on
your hands now that you lost your job.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.855
Ooh, must be tough, huh?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.149
Yeah, it's hard. They paid me to go away

13:36.232 --> 13:39.485
so now I've got
a five-year lump sum severance package

13:39.569 --> 13:40.987
and I don't know what to do with it.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.740
I've just got piles of money lying around.

13:44.282 --> 13:48.202
I went to Vegas to try to lose some of it,
but I even won more.

13:48.286 --> 13:52.123
A lady of the night refused payment.
She just wanted to smell my T-shirt.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.625
So, yeah, it's hard.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.170
Why can't I just die in my sleep?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.880
Great talking to you, Frank.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.551
[camera clicking]

14:03.634 --> 14:06.512
Oh, man. Vic is such a great guy.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.265
He shot up his house.
Why would he do that?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.767
You and me think alike, Bill.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.685
Thanks for sticking with me.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.562
You're a chip off the old block.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.398
Dependable, loyal, fair-skinned.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.275
Look at you. Getting a healthy sunburn.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.027
It's starting to hurt, Dad.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.153
Life hurts, son.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.946
You know, I learned something
when your mom and me

14:24.030 --> 14:26.157
went through our little troubles
back there.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.619
Sometimes it's easy to fly off the handle
but hard to say what you really feel.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.371
Bridget Fitzsimmons.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.415
[romantic music playing]

14:40.797 --> 14:41.923
[Frank] I'm glad you're my son.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.259
-I'm really proud--
-I have to go to the bathroom.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.178
What?! No. Don't leave your spot.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.722
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I'm about to have diarrhea.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.182
As your father, I'm telling you

14:51.265 --> 14:53.267
-to make it stop.
-I can't. I'm starting to come out.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.394
Suck it back in.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.814
We're having a father-son moment,
you fucking ingrate.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.608
Don't you even think of leaving.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.693
Yes,<i> mein Führer.</i>

15:02.777 --> 15:04.153
Whoop.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.072
So, I'm back on the market again.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.657
I haven't dated in years.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.785
I guess you could say
I'm discounted for clearance.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.787
Ginny? Ginny Throater.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.455
Oh, fuck me.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.790
Oh, hi Sue.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.458
How are you holding up?

15:17.542 --> 15:19.168
How do you think?

15:19.252 --> 15:24.048
Greg's living an honest life now,
so I'm not allowed to complain.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.635
Well, you won't have any complaints
with my new invention.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.137
Does it vibrate?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.847
-No.
-Aw.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.807
It's called the Carrot Crisper.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.685
Sue, can I be brutally honest?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.603
I came here today for one reason.

15:37.687 --> 15:41.482
To watch the parade and meet a man
who isn't repulsed by my kunker.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.942
Is that so much to ask?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.236
No, it isn't.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.113
Sorry I bothered you.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.825
Chin up, Sue. Life is beautiful.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.910
Let's get them, girls.

15:54.328 --> 15:58.624
Let's hear it for the Malcolm X
Shabazz High School Justice Warriors.

15:58.708 --> 16:02.753
A hundred and fifty strong and proudly
dedicated to the struggle for equal--

16:02.837 --> 16:04.130
I'm not reading the rest of this.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.799
Hey, Kevin. Thirsty?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.885
We brought soda.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.970
A special kind of soda.

16:11.053 --> 16:14.390
With something extra added to the soda.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.726
Something that's not soda.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.270
-Something from Russia.
-I get it.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.938
Stop being so obvious.

16:21.022 --> 16:24.734
Dad. Can I please go hang out
with Bolo and Lex?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.819
-No.
-God, this is like a kidnapping.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.280
You're my property, Kevin.
I'll stuff you in the trunk if I want to.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.324
-Dad, come on.
-I'll come on you.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.744
[all chuckle]

16:34.827 --> 16:38.080
It's cool, Mr. Murphy.
We'll help you save the chairs.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.125
Thank you. Why can't you be
more like your friends, Kevin?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.422
[Bolo] That's the green death.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.391
Ah.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.519
The blessings of Christ on you.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.895
Oop.

17:00.978 --> 17:06.400
Murphy! I told you to stay away
from my sister, you goddamn turd fucker.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.152
James! Language.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.904
Sorry, Father.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.782
Gosh darn, turd fucker.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.330
The carrots are whirled to crispness
by this amazing--

17:19.413 --> 17:21.916
Ma'am, have you been handing
these flyers out along the parade?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.334
Uh, yes. [chuckles]

17:23.417 --> 17:25.503
I'm afraid I have to write you a ticket.

17:25.586 --> 17:29.257
What?! I don't need a vendor's permit.
I'm not selling anything.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.591
That's very clear.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.302
I'm giving you
a 100-dollar fine for littering.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.555
A hundred dollars?

17:35.638 --> 17:37.765
That's a semester of college.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.601
[chuckles] I love soda.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.979
[all laugh]

17:43.062 --> 17:45.022
God help this generation.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.442
Here comes the Rustland Air Force Base
Fighting 49th.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.860
The Air Force!

17:50.611 --> 17:52.321
What a beautiful sight.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.698
[Jim] After bravely fighting the fight

17:53.781 --> 17:56.450
those quitters in Washington
wouldn't let them finish,

17:56.534 --> 17:59.453
these sky warriors have returned
with honor, valor,

17:59.537 --> 18:01.914
and a tenacious strain of gonorrhea.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.125
[crowd cheers]

18:04.208 --> 18:06.252
You stand up
and show these men some respect.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.547
When are you guys going to win one?

18:09.630 --> 18:11.841
[all laugh]

18:11.924 --> 18:14.802
You're a fucking embarrassment,
you know that? Get out!

18:14.885 --> 18:17.555
Yes! We've been paroled.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.266
This will be my summer of freedom.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.726
-Ow, my dick!
-[laughing]

18:23.227 --> 18:25.271
Here comes the computer club.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.815
They're out of this world
in their space office.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.443
Let's hear it
for these future astronauts...

18:30.526 --> 18:33.738
or computer technicians.
This float confuses me.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.448
Is someone sitting here?

18:35.531 --> 18:37.742
Yes! Goddamn it, back off.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.077
These chairs are all mine.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.245
Fucking draft dodgers.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.246
[woman] Hi, Scotty.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.706
Say hi to Mommy.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.416
-Hey!
-We're so proud of you.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.461
No one can see me back here.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.338
<i>Screw this!</i>

18:50.421 --> 18:53.591
-Maureen, no, you'll die in space!
-I don't care.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.301
She's broken the air lock.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.428
We're all going to die! [screams]

18:57.511 --> 18:58.929
Maureen, be a good girl.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.682
Get off of the space station
and go back to your satellite.

19:01.766 --> 19:02.975
I hate this parade,

19:03.059 --> 19:04.977
and this isn't even
a real computer anyway,

19:05.061 --> 19:07.521
it's a stupid refrigerator box.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.439
Hey!

19:08.522 --> 19:10.024
Nice going, Maureen.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.777
You just kicked a boy in a wheelchair.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.946
It's okay. I didn't feel it.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.239
Hey! That's mine.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.826
Daddy, point the camera at me.
I'm right here.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.244
You gave up your spot.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.954
The hell I did. It's mine.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.916
[grunts] Fucking kid.
-Give it.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.043
You can't do this to me.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.212
I'm sorry, but I have to enforce the law.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.798
If I ignored the little things,
where would we be?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.633
Suck jobs.

19:36.801 --> 19:37.677
Ah!

19:49.355 --> 19:50.856
Jimmy Fitzsimmons!

19:50.940 --> 19:52.274
Oh, shit.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.859
Goddammit, let go.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.361
Give it! My dad's a cop.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.405
My dad's an asshole. Fuck off!

19:57.988 --> 19:58.948
Ow!

19:59.824 --> 20:01.117
Oh, Jesus.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.076
Daddy!

20:02.159 --> 20:03.327
Holy shit.

20:03.411 --> 20:04.745
Hang on, Jeffrey.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.248
[grunts] So cold.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.585
How was reform school, you little thief?

20:11.669 --> 20:13.254
Uh, it was all right.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.216
You steal from me again,
I'll chase you down.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.843
I got a new wooden leg.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.678
A negro leg.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.221

20:22.763 --> 20:26.058

to stay away from her, Murphy.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.730
What the fuck are you doing to my son?

20:30.813 --> 20:33.274
He gave me a beer and then he touched me.
[whimpers]

20:33.357 --> 20:36.026
It wasn't sexual.
I was just trying to hurt him.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.319
I tell you I can't win.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.072
Everyone's going out of their way
to ruin my Memorial Day.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.701
All I wanted to do was start off my summer
with my family by watching a parade.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.413
Are they here or did you open
your fat mouth and scare them off too?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.081
They're here. There's my wife.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.542
-This is police brutality.
-[Frank] My daughter's on that float.

Get off of him!

20:56.422 --> 20:57.465
And that's my other son.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.133
He's resting.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.593
[Kevin moans]

21:02.678 --> 21:04.138
Look at this man.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.349
Do you see the pain, the shame?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.810
Daddy's not going to arrest him.

21:09.894 --> 21:11.854
'Cause there's nothing a jail cell
could do to him

21:11.937 --> 21:13.564
that he hasn't already done to himself.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.485
His life is his prison.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.490
Jeffrey, people like that
need to be eliminated.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.744
Son, how about you and me
get some ice cream, huh?

21:26.827 --> 21:28.954
Enjoy your chairs.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.415
They're as empty as your life.

Fucking sun.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.729
Ooh, are you okay?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.482
I can feel the heat
coming off of your body from here.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.608
I'll be fine.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.819
It'll hurt like hell for a week.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.403
I'll have fun peeling it off

22:01.487 --> 22:03.697
and then I have a nice base
for the rest of the summer.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.491
[growling]

22:05.574 --> 22:08.035
Christ, now this one hates me too?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.161
What's got into him?

22:09.453 --> 22:12.623
Frank, he's just being protective
'cause I'm pregnant.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.875
I hate to waste one of my
best socks but...

22:15.417 --> 22:16.794
Go on, boy, go get that sock.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.921
You go get that sock. You get that sock.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.798
[laughs] Stupid maniac.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.385
I think we need to talk about
what happened today.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.347
What do you mean what happened today,
we had fun at a parade.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.267
You fought a nine year old...
whose father is a cop.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.810
I didn't know that.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.895
I thought I was just fighting
a regular nine year old.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.981
Frank, come on.

22:37.064 --> 22:40.651
You were out of sorts all day
and I wasn't in much better shape.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.028
If we learned anything
from all that hell we went through,

22:43.112 --> 22:44.822
it's we have to communicate.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.700
I want you to tell me the truth.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.035
Does this have anything to do
with the baby coming?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.496
No.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.040
Why would I be upset
about the baby coming?

22:55.124 --> 22:58.127
When I told you I was pregnant,
you put your fist through the wall.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.339
I was looking for a stud so I could
hang a picture of how happy I was.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.301
-That's ridiculous.
-So is having a kid at 40.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.431
Okay, it was a bit of a shock at first,
but I'm fine now.

23:10.514 --> 23:14.310
We'd just got our marriage back and we had
all these things we were going to do.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.061
We'll still do them.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.981
Ah, you'll come up
with a great new product...

23:19.064 --> 23:21.984
whatever it is,
and I'll get those flight lessons someday.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.820
-We've got plenty of time.
-I guess you're right.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.740
One more baby's not going to
knock us off our stride.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.450
We're veterans at this.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.035
They should have a parade for us.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.412
We've already done this three times
and nobody's died...

23:33.746 --> 23:35.080
-for very long.
-Yeah.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.041
-We brought him back.
-We did bring him back.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.084
And the kids are practically grown now.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.045
They can take care of themselves.

23:41.128 --> 23:44.632
This summer is for taking the time to do
what we want to do. Right?

23:44.715 --> 23:47.343
-[sighs] Sure.
-So, you're not worried.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.639
No! No, not anymore. I feel great now.
