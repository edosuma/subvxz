00:44.983 --> 00:46.007
(grunts)

00:46.051 --> 00:48.519
Bobby Hill,
what are you doing?

00:48.553 --> 00:50.919
I'm ironing underwater.

00:50.956 --> 00:53.049
Blurp, blurp, blurp.

00:53.091 --> 00:55.025
Don’t test me, young man.

00:55.060 --> 00:57.528
I've failed
funnier kids than you.

00:57.562 --> 00:58.961
All right, children

00:58.997 --> 01:00.089
irons down.

01:00.131 --> 01:02.224
With the help
of Ernie the janitor

01:02.267 --> 01:05.394
I have soiled each of these
cheerleader uniforms.

01:05.437 --> 01:08.964
Your take-home exam
is to identify and remove

01:09.007 --> 01:10.235
the mystery stain

01:10.275 --> 01:12.971
and here's one
for our class clown.

01:13.011 --> 01:14.876
Oh, wait, let
me give you

01:14.913 --> 01:17.541
some extra credit.

01:23.388 --> 01:25.549
If it's Monday night,
it must be

01:25.590 --> 01:27.683
Frito pie
with Wolf-brand chili.

01:27.726 --> 01:30.854
I made it just the way
you like it... perfect.

01:31.796 --> 01:33.593
Come on, Bobby, it's Frito pie

01:33.632 --> 01:35.361
with Wolf-brand chili night.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.697
What the?

01:37.669 --> 01:38.693
There better be

01:38.737 --> 01:41.433
a naked cheerleader
under your bed.

01:41.473 --> 01:45.034
Don’t get mad, but I think
I'm going to fail Home Ec.

01:45.076 --> 01:46.100
Well, of course

01:46.144 --> 01:48.009
you're failing Home Ec...
you're a guy.

01:49.714 --> 01:53.480
Did you know your son
is taking Home Ec?

01:53.518 --> 01:54.610
(sighs)

01:54.653 --> 01:56.382
They got him playing
with skirts!

01:56.421 --> 01:58.912
If Bobby learns to cook
and clean for himself

01:58.957 --> 02:01.391
what's his motivation
to ever get married?

02:01.426 --> 02:04.520
Home Ec is not going to
turn Bobby into a sissy.

02:04.562 --> 02:07.360
In prison movies, the
toughest characters

02:07.399 --> 02:09.299
always work
in the kitchen.

02:11.336 --> 02:13.361
I wouldn't
worry, Hank.

02:13.405 --> 02:15.032
When I was the, uh

02:15.073 --> 02:17.701
varsity football
towel manager

02:17.742 --> 02:20.609
I cleaned 50
jockstraps a week.

02:20.645 --> 02:22.272
I turned out okay.

02:22.313 --> 02:23.871
(sighs)

02:25.483 --> 02:26.882
Hey, man, nice shot.

02:26.918 --> 02:28.681
Man, hey no,
nothing but ice.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.948
Oh, please.

02:29.988 --> 02:33.754
When I was the, uh,
varsity football towel manager

02:33.792 --> 02:35.953
I once slang-shot
a jockstrap

02:35.994 --> 02:39.157
into a laundry hamper
from 50 yards away.

02:39.197 --> 02:42.997
Betcha a million dollars
you can't do that again.

02:43.034 --> 02:44.524
You're on!

02:50.975 --> 02:51.999
(grunts)

02:52.043 --> 02:53.772
Oh!
Hah!

02:53.812 --> 02:55.006
You choked.

02:55.046 --> 02:57.037
You owe me
a million dollars.

02:57.082 --> 02:57.980
Choker!

02:58.016 --> 03:00.314
(choking)

03:00.351 --> 03:01.511
(coughing)

03:01.553 --> 03:02.645
Uh!

03:02.687 --> 03:06.145
(coughing)

03:10.361 --> 03:12.056
Choker!

03:13.965 --> 03:16.729
Dad says that men
install washing machines

03:16.768 --> 03:18.668
they service
washing machines

03:18.703 --> 03:22.002
but they aren’t supposed
to use washing machines.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.166
Oh, please.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.369
There's no rule
that says only women

03:25.410 --> 03:28.345
can do housework
and only men can have careers.

03:28.379 --> 03:29.971
I can do both.

03:30.014 --> 03:33.279
I am what the magazines
call a superwoman.

03:33.318 --> 03:34.945
I like Superwoman.

03:34.986 --> 03:36.146
Oh, Bobby, thank you.

03:36.187 --> 03:38.155
Now let's take a look
at your homework.

03:38.189 --> 03:40.919
When we're done with it,
this stain is going to wish

03:40.959 --> 03:43.189
it was still
some cheerleader's lunch.

03:44.195 --> 03:46.425
First, you blind-side it
with pre-soak.

03:46.464 --> 03:49.297
Then you sucker-punch it
with some hot water

03:49.334 --> 03:51.666
andjust when
it's begging for mercy

03:51.703 --> 03:54.934
you rip off its head
and pour bleach down its neck.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.270
Finish it off, Bobby!

03:56.307 --> 03:59.435
Are you going to let
that stain call you a sissy?!

03:59.477 --> 04:01.536
No!

04:04.716 --> 04:07.207
I know it's not even
Thanksgiving yet

04:07.252 --> 04:09.948
but it feels
like Christmas morning.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.753
Well, it's full
of holes

04:13.792 --> 04:16.317
but you did get
the stains out...

04:16.361 --> 04:17.793
mostly.

04:17.829 --> 04:19.319
(gasps)

04:19.363 --> 04:20.558
Uh-oh.

04:20.598 --> 04:23.897
Bobby, these are your
father's dungarees!

04:23.935 --> 04:25.163
(sighs)

04:25.203 --> 04:26.727
How could you, Peggy?

04:26.771 --> 04:30.036
Now what am I gonna carve
the turkey in... my underwear?

04:30.074 --> 04:32.008
Not with an
electric knife, no sir.

04:32.043 --> 04:36.275
Even world-famous surgeons
do not get it right
100% of the time.

04:36.314 --> 04:38.009
They make
mistakes, Hank.

04:38.049 --> 04:39.175
People die.

04:39.217 --> 04:40.309
We are human.

04:40.351 --> 04:42.376
(sighing)

04:46.291 --> 04:49.283
Ms. Bittner,
I'm not going to lie to you.

04:49.327 --> 04:52.819
I don't think I heard one thing
you've said all year

04:52.864 --> 04:55.765
especially whatever
you said about bleach.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.769
Can you help me fix
my dad's pants?

04:58.803 --> 05:01.294
He can't wear one of
your clever jokes?

05:01.339 --> 05:05.935
Please, Ms. Bittner, I've never
asked for anything from you

05:05.977 --> 05:07.808
except more sugar.

05:13.351 --> 05:15.546
Ooh, fancy!

05:15.587 --> 05:17.885
Hey, Hank, how's it
going at the bank?

05:17.922 --> 05:20.049
How the hell
should I know?

05:20.091 --> 05:22.559
On a related
fiscal note, Bill

05:22.594 --> 05:24.892
where's the million
bucks you owe me?

05:24.929 --> 05:26.760
Oh, right, Dale, yeah.

05:28.867 --> 05:30.164
Suitable for framing.

05:30.201 --> 05:33.329
There you go...
$1 million!

05:33.371 --> 05:37.205
I guess I'll have to sell
my private island

05:37.242 --> 05:39.608
in the South Pacific, huh?

05:39.644 --> 05:41.544
You never go anyway.

05:43.548 --> 05:47.348
Dad, would you like to wear
jeans to work today?

05:47.385 --> 05:48.716
You know I would.

05:48.753 --> 05:50.778
Look what I got!

05:50.822 --> 05:53.017
I got a bolt of denim
from Ms. Bittner.

05:53.057 --> 05:56.026
I used your old jeans
as a pattern and I fired up

05:56.060 --> 05:57.425
Mom's sewing machine.

05:57.462 --> 05:58.622
My sewing machine?

05:58.663 --> 06:01.996
No, it can't make seams
this straight.

06:03.201 --> 06:06.136
Well, I guess it wouldn’t hurt
to try them on.

06:12.343 --> 06:14.072
Well, all right, Bobby!

06:14.112 --> 06:15.409
They're perfect.

06:16.281 --> 06:17.748
I mean, they're
a little stiff

06:17.782 --> 06:20.478
but after I break 'em in
for a couple years

06:20.518 --> 06:21.780
they'll be perfect.

06:21.819 --> 06:24.754
Hang on, I picked up
a little trick in Home Ec.

06:24.789 --> 06:26.222
I hope you don't mind...

06:26.257 --> 06:28.987
I borrowed
your power sander.

06:29.027 --> 06:30.358
(chuckling)

06:30.395 --> 06:32.090
Peggy, he's right.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.655
I can feel
the denim loosening up.

06:34.699 --> 06:36.826
I'm glad you ruined my jeans.

06:36.868 --> 06:38.927
Bobby's made them
even better.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.938
(chuckling)

06:44.542 --> 06:47.102
Bobby, eight hours
and no chafing!

06:47.145 --> 06:49.841
I know what
I'm leading off with

06:49.881 --> 06:51.439
in my Thanksgiving prayer.

06:51.482 --> 06:53.347
...three, two, one, mark!

06:53.384 --> 06:54.715
Buns in the oven!

06:54.752 --> 06:58.017
Oh, then you're not
just sewing in Home Ec...

06:58.056 --> 06:59.717
they've got you
cooking too, huh?

06:59.757 --> 07:01.554
I hope you don't mind

07:01.592 --> 07:03.116
but I opened a bottle of
your wedding wine

07:03.161 --> 07:04.719
to marinate my pot roast.

07:04.762 --> 07:07.253
Well, just make sure
when you're done playing

07:07.298 --> 07:09.129
your mother has
her kitchen back.

07:09.167 --> 07:12.625
It's Tuesday night
pork chops, you know.

07:12.670 --> 07:14.535
Yes, Bobby,
I can handle the heat

07:14.572 --> 07:16.301
so get out of my kitchen,
because with pork

07:16.341 --> 07:19.310
the slightest mistake
could kill us all.

07:24.248 --> 07:27.376
I'd like to cash this
for cash.

07:27.418 --> 07:29.045
A thousand thousands
will be fine.

07:29.087 --> 07:32.454
Most of the million dollar
checks we see are jokes.

07:32.490 --> 07:34.720
Your job sounds fun.

07:34.759 --> 07:43.758
I'm sorry, Mr. Dauterive
only has $418.75.

07:43.801 --> 07:47.328
Okay, then give me
400 Sacagawea coins

07:47.372 --> 07:48.930
18 Susan B. Anthonys

07:48.973 --> 07:52.932
two North Carolina quarters
and a Utah.

08:01.486 --> 08:07.083
Yep... tastes
like Tuesday.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.753
Thank you, Hank.

08:09.794 --> 08:11.284
Say, that smells
pretty good.

08:11.329 --> 08:12.762
Thanks, Dad.

08:12.797 --> 08:14.196
Could you sign this form

08:14.232 --> 08:17.201
saying I cooked it myself
and that it tasted okay?

08:17.235 --> 08:18.759
Yeah, I'll help you
with your homework.

08:18.803 --> 08:22.466
Hank, you will spoil
your appetite.

08:22.507 --> 08:25.101
Mm, no, no, it's okay.

08:25.143 --> 08:28.601
Let's eat Bobby's
pot roast now

08:28.646 --> 08:30.614
while it's still juicy.

08:30.648 --> 08:32.616
Your pork chops will be
just as good tomorrow.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.207
No, no, no.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.049
Wednesday is
spa-Peggy and meatballs day.

08:36.087 --> 08:38.317
You can't have pork chops
on Wednesday.

08:38.356 --> 08:39.823
That would throw off
the whole rotation.

08:39.857 --> 08:43.554
(chuckling):
Wednesday.

08:43.594 --> 08:45.528
You would not have
believed it, Nancy.

08:45.563 --> 08:47.463
He ate
that pot roast like...

08:47.498 --> 08:49.466
like it was
my pork chops

08:49.500 --> 08:51.730
and my pork chops
were sitting right there!

08:51.769 --> 08:55.034
What you need, sug,
is an unfair advantage.

08:55.073 --> 08:57.940
It's the library's,
so try not to get
anything on it.

08:57.975 --> 09:01.103
A homemaking magazine?

09:01.145 --> 09:03.841
Oh, no, no thank you,
I have never needed to...

09:03.881 --> 09:06.975
Well, that is the most beautiful
Thanksgiving centerpiece

09:07.018 --> 09:14.447
I have ever seen.

09:14.492 --> 09:15.754
Hey, Peggy.

09:15.793 --> 09:18.660
Uh, why's the table
covered with yard waste?

09:18.696 --> 09:20.630
Hank, it is not yard waste.

09:20.665 --> 09:22.656
Or it will not be
when I get through with it.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.931
It will be our new stunning
Thanksgiving centerpiece...

09:25.970 --> 09:28.837
made entirely of yard waste!

09:28.873 --> 09:30.670
Ew, don't touch it, Bobby.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.471
Those nests could be
full of fleas and ticks.

09:32.510 --> 09:34.705
Not if you take the birds out.

09:34.745 --> 09:38.545
They'll build
another nest.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.744
They're not just going to let
their eggs

09:40.785 --> 09:44.186
sit there on the sidewalk.

09:51.696 --> 09:54.631
(grunting in pain)

09:54.665 --> 09:57.930
Okay, Ernst is done
removing the parasites

09:57.969 --> 09:59.368
but he cannot comb out

09:59.403 --> 10:01.997
the dark sadness
that entangles you.

10:02.039 --> 10:03.336
What's up with that?

10:03.374 --> 10:05.103
Ernst, imagine

10:05.143 --> 10:07.611
if the man you loved
found someone else

10:07.645 --> 10:10.011
to cook for him,
and clean for him

10:10.047 --> 10:11.480
and make his pants.

10:11.516 --> 10:14.383
Who is this other woman?

10:14.418 --> 10:16.352
The other woman is my son.

10:16.387 --> 10:18.617
He may be getting
an A in Home Ec

10:18.656 --> 10:20.521
but at what cost, huh?

10:20.558 --> 10:23.049
At what cost to me?

10:23.094 --> 10:24.755
Cooking and cleaning
and sewing...

10:24.795 --> 10:27.263
I did not hear you
mention the boudoir.

10:27.298 --> 10:31.064
I can think of many things
to be done there for Hank.

10:31.102 --> 10:33.696
Well, I am
an excellent lover.

10:33.738 --> 10:37.174
And Ernst is an excellent
hairstylist.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.438
Together let us
take your husband places

10:39.477 --> 10:49.079
from our wildest dreams!

10:49.120 --> 10:51.452
Sorry, sir, but you have
more food than money.

10:51.489 --> 10:53.923
Okay, I don't need
cling wrap.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.483
This is my whole
Thanksgiving dinner

10:56.527 --> 10:57.755
and who am I kidding

10:57.795 --> 11:01.492
there aren't going to be
any leftovers!

11:01.532 --> 11:02.521
(chuckling)

11:02.567 --> 11:05.400
Um, you're still over.

11:05.436 --> 11:07.734
Oh.

11:07.772 --> 11:09.034
But, but...

11:09.073 --> 11:11.098
you can't take my turkey.

11:11.142 --> 11:14.168
(sighs)

11:14.212 --> 11:16.180
Still over.

11:27.758 --> 11:30.226
This circular saw cozy
fits great, son

11:30.261 --> 11:32.252
but can we call it
something else?

11:32.296 --> 11:35.026
Hey, how about
a circular saw buddy?

11:35.066 --> 11:37.159
You name it
and I'll knit it!

11:37.201 --> 11:39.761
Hey, Peggy!

11:39.804 --> 11:42.500
Bobby made me
a circular saw buddy.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.633
Whoa, your hair looks great.

11:44.675 --> 11:46.643
It's so big.

11:46.677 --> 11:48.474
Well, I hope it's not too tall

11:48.512 --> 11:50.946
to get through
the bedroom door, Hank.

11:50.982 --> 11:53.450
Well, the doorway's got
a seven-foot clearance.

11:53.484 --> 11:55.145
BOBBY:
Dinner!

11:55.353 --> 11:58.720
When it got to be 5:00
and you weren't home

11:58.756 --> 12:00.553
I asked Bobby
to whip something up.

12:00.591 --> 12:02.024
Well, that's a good idea.

12:02.059 --> 12:03.151
The sooner we eat

12:03.194 --> 12:07.631
the sooner we can
get to... dessert.

12:07.665 --> 12:09.064
(suggestive growl)

12:09.100 --> 12:11.967
I think Bobby made pie.

12:16.107 --> 12:18.803
Ugh, I probably should've
stopped at seconds.

12:18.843 --> 12:21.243
I'm not usually
a big fan of cheese

12:21.279 --> 12:24.305
but boy, the things
Bobby does with it...

12:24.348 --> 12:28.011
I have an idea how we can
burn off some calories, Hank.

12:28.052 --> 12:29.383
(nauseated groan)

12:29.420 --> 12:30.751
What's wrong?

12:30.788 --> 12:32.517
Is Bobby's cooking
coming up on you?

12:32.556 --> 12:35.354
I think it's all that
beauty stuff in your hair.

12:35.393 --> 12:39.386
It kind of has
that new car smell.

12:41.732 --> 12:44.963
Boy, that cheese! Mm!

12:45.002 --> 12:52.340
(retching and coughing)

12:59.617 --> 13:03.678
Hank, what is going on?

13:03.721 --> 13:05.245
(coughing)

13:05.289 --> 13:08.190
The fumes coming off your hair
keep waking me up.

13:08.225 --> 13:11.217
You don't smell like
a new car.

13:11.262 --> 13:14.891
I just said that
to make you feel better.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.894
Bobby, put away your robot
and go to bed.

13:18.936 --> 13:21.700
I need the couch.

13:21.739 --> 13:23.468
Your father’s feeling ill.

13:23.507 --> 13:25.475
I think it was
something he ate.

13:25.509 --> 13:27.101
Why don't you just
take my bed?

13:27.144 --> 13:28.975
I've got a lot of work
to do out here.

13:29.013 --> 13:33.507
Agh! Was this ever
an outdoor couch?

13:33.551 --> 13:34.813
Okay, fine,
I will sleep in your bed

13:34.852 --> 13:36.820
right under your boogerwall.

13:36.854 --> 13:43.418
I thought I heard
an upholstery shampooer.

13:43.461 --> 13:45.588
Maybe you could use that thing
to get the smell

13:45.629 --> 13:47.927
out of your mother's side
of the bed.

13:47.965 --> 13:48.932
Have you seen her?

13:48.966 --> 13:50.831
She was looking for
a place to sleep

13:50.868 --> 13:52.699
so I let her have my bed.

13:52.737 --> 13:54.568
Well, where are
you going to sleep?

13:54.605 --> 13:56.573
I'll just crash on the couch.

13:56.607 --> 13:57.733
It's still a little wet

13:57.775 --> 14:00.710
but it gives me an excuse
to sleep in my poncho.

14:00.745 --> 14:02.576
No, no, your mother's bed
is empty.

14:02.613 --> 14:05.047
Why don't you just
bunk with me in
the big bedroom?

14:05.082 --> 14:07.209
I'll make caramel popcorn!

14:07.251 --> 14:08.616
I'll turn on the TV.

14:08.652 --> 14:10.119
It's such a clear night

14:10.154 --> 14:12.452
we might be able to pick up
the news from San Antonio.

14:12.490 --> 14:14.958
Their sports guy played for
the Oilers for a year.

14:14.992 --> 14:20.453
I didn't know your bed
was made of two little beds.

14:20.498 --> 14:22.932
Well, your mother
likes her mattress firm

14:22.967 --> 14:24.491
and I like mine
extra firm.

14:24.535 --> 14:27.527
So I guess it's true,
opposites attract.

14:27.571 --> 14:29.835
Check it out...
the weather girl

14:29.874 --> 14:32.001
is looking at
the wrong camera.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.509
(patronizing laugh)

14:33.544 --> 14:35.034
San Antonio.

14:35.079 --> 14:37.343
And it's going
to rain tomorrow.

14:37.381 --> 14:41.215
(laughter)

14:41.252 --> 14:42.947
Why would anyone
live there?

14:42.987 --> 14:45.751
You know who'd
get a kick out of this?

14:45.790 --> 14:48.224
Ladybird!

14:48.259 --> 14:51.126
Come here, girl!

14:51.162 --> 14:53.722
(sobbing)

15:08.112 --> 15:09.477
HANK:
That Miss Piggy balloon

15:09.513 --> 15:15.213
has the same hairdo
as your mother.

15:15.252 --> 15:16.947
Hey, Peggy.

15:16.987 --> 15:19.547
Well, maybe for you it is.

15:19.590 --> 15:23.048
Oh, I was expecting you to say,
"Good morning."

15:23.093 --> 15:24.253
So...

15:24.295 --> 15:25.956
did you sleep well?

15:25.996 --> 15:27.463
Not really.

15:27.498 --> 15:29.022
Bobby and I were up
all night talking...

15:29.066 --> 15:31.626
really, really talking.

15:31.669 --> 15:39.235
(muffled scream)

15:42.613 --> 15:46.310
(gasps)

15:47.117 --> 15:48.812
So, that's where it went.

15:48.853 --> 15:50.377
Perfect!

15:50.421 --> 15:52.355
Hank, come in here, quick!

15:52.389 --> 15:54.516
Look what I found
in Bobby's bed.

15:54.558 --> 15:57.322
Mm-hmm, it's a
ladies' magazine

15:57.361 --> 15:58.726
and that is
not my opinion.

15:58.762 --> 16:00.992
It says so right
in the title.

16:01.031 --> 16:02.589
You were right
about Home Ec, Hank...

16:02.633 --> 16:04.066
it's ruining Bobby.

16:04.101 --> 16:06.865
Every perfume ad has been
scratched and sniffed

16:06.904 --> 16:08.394
and his horoscope says

16:08.439 --> 16:09.963
that this is a
good week for him

16:10.007 --> 16:12.032
to meet the man
of his dreams.

16:12.076 --> 16:14.101
If you ask me, Hank,
that boy ain't right.

16:14.144 --> 16:18.979
Bobby, get in here. Now.

16:19.016 --> 16:20.176
What's up, Dad?

16:20.217 --> 16:23.414
Son, do you think
you could make

16:23.454 --> 16:25.388
this buttermilk-
basted turkey?

16:25.422 --> 16:29.290
Well, that recipe
takes 24 hours.

16:29.326 --> 16:34.662
Good thing I started on it
last night.

16:34.698 --> 16:36.563
(chuckling)

16:36.600 --> 16:37.931
I just thought
you were getting up

16:37.968 --> 16:39.799
to use the bathroom a lot.

16:39.837 --> 16:40.826
You know what?

16:40.871 --> 16:42.896
Let's have Bobby
handle the whole meal.

16:42.940 --> 16:45.340
What?!
But-but every year I...

16:45.376 --> 16:48.812
This year the only thing
you have to do is get hungry.

16:48.846 --> 16:50.643
Just kick back on the couch

16:50.681 --> 16:52.876
now that it's fit to sit on.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.214
BOBBY:
Oh, Dad...

16:54.251 --> 16:55.445
where's the turkey platter?

16:55.486 --> 16:57.283
I want to start
on the radish roses.

16:57.321 --> 16:58.754
It's in the garage,
in a box marked:

16:58.789 --> 17:01.314
"Winter holiday poultry
serving dishes."

17:01.358 --> 17:02.791
Here, I'll help you
find it.

17:02.826 --> 17:06.227
Mom, you mind
popping my bird in?

17:06.262 --> 17:07.958
Don’t worry, the racks are set

17:07.998 --> 17:10.558
and the oven's
already preheated.

17:10.601 --> 17:13.161
It's idiot-proof.

17:23.781 --> 17:27.773
They do not deserve us.

17:33.891 --> 17:37.588
Oh... boxed in!

17:41.432 --> 17:44.424
Did I fix my roof
in the last few days?

17:44.468 --> 17:47.403
Well, it still looks
pretty bad, so maybe.

17:47.438 --> 17:48.735
Why?

17:48.772 --> 17:50.535
I can't buy any
Thanksgiving food

17:50.574 --> 17:52.132
because my bank account is empty

17:52.176 --> 17:54.542
and... and I can't remember
what I spent it on.

17:54.578 --> 17:57.570
It's empty because I
cashed your check, Bill

17:57.615 --> 18:00.482
which did not clear for
the full million dollars.

18:00.517 --> 18:03.452
But that check was a joke,
just like the bet.

18:03.487 --> 18:05.546
It was a joke...
I laughed.

18:05.589 --> 18:07.819
We had a legitimate
oral contract

18:07.858 --> 18:09.883
entered into fully and freely

18:09.927 --> 18:11.861
when I said, "Betcha"

18:11.895 --> 18:14.887
and you said, and I
quote, "You're on."

18:14.932 --> 18:16.900
Dale, stop talking
like a lawyer

18:16.934 --> 18:18.902
and give Bill his money back.

18:18.936 --> 18:19.994
What's the point?

18:20.037 --> 18:21.163
Bill would
probably just go

18:21.205 --> 18:26.336
and spend it on
something stupid,
like himself.

18:54.905 --> 18:57.100
Peggy?

18:57.141 --> 19:00.599
Oh, I see my haircut
was a success!

19:00.644 --> 19:04.580
Your Hank, he ravaged
you last night, yes?

19:04.615 --> 19:07.083
Tell me, what did
you do to him?

19:07.117 --> 19:09.381
I stole his turkey
is what I did.

19:09.420 --> 19:15.552
I would rather share it
with a man who needs me

19:15.592 --> 19:18.390
a man who is also alone
on Thanksgiving

19:18.429 --> 19:20.124
because of the stigma
society attaches

19:20.164 --> 19:23.190
to his unconventional
sexual appetites.

19:23.233 --> 19:26.100
Get in here,
you drama queen.

19:26.136 --> 19:29.435
Tell me, tell me, who
is this mystery man?

19:29.473 --> 19:31.737
Who the hell is she?

19:31.775 --> 19:35.939
Peggy Hill,
this is my wife Claudia

19:35.979 --> 19:37.970
and my little angel Brett.

19:38.015 --> 19:42.577
You have a family
that loves you?

19:42.619 --> 19:47.716
(crying)

19:48.559 --> 19:50.857
(phone rings)

19:51.562 --> 19:53.359
Hank Hill.
Happy Thanksgiving.

19:53.397 --> 19:56.093
ERNST (on phone):
Hank, this is Ernst.

19:56.133 --> 19:57.430
I hope you're sitting down

19:57.468 --> 19:59.902
for the bombshell
I am about to drop.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.962
Last chance to sit.

20:02.005 --> 20:03.734
Is this about the smell
in Peggy's hair?

20:03.774 --> 20:06.140
This is not about some smell
that you are imagining.

20:06.176 --> 20:08.041
Peggy is here with your turkey.

20:08.078 --> 20:10.342
They are both
bruised and broken.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.405
HANK:
Son of a gun!

20:12.449 --> 20:15.043
Your mother took the turkey and
ran off to her hairdresser's.

20:15.085 --> 20:17.417
You have made her

20:17.454 --> 20:19.684
feel useless in her own house.

20:19.723 --> 20:21.486
Now she is at my house

20:21.525 --> 20:24.426
laying face down in a puddle
of her own self-esteem.

20:24.461 --> 20:26.622
Pull her out before she drowns!

20:26.663 --> 20:29.063
I breast-fed my Bobby.

20:29.099 --> 20:30.828
Big mistake.

20:30.868 --> 20:33.428
(Hank sighs)

20:34.037 --> 20:35.163
Bobby...

20:35.205 --> 20:36.399
I need you to do two things

20:36.440 --> 20:38.601
I pray you'll
never have to do again.

20:38.642 --> 20:41.110
Tape the Cowboys' game

20:41.145 --> 20:43.773
and give me an apron.

20:53.056 --> 20:54.580
Hello, Peggy.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.923
I'm sorry I'm so
under dressed, Hank.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.485
I see you and Bobby
decided to go formal.

20:59.530 --> 21:01.555
No, I sent Bobby
to the neighbors

21:01.598 --> 21:04.795
but first, we whipped up
some of our favorite dishes.

21:04.835 --> 21:08.669
Happy Thanksgiving!

21:08.705 --> 21:10.366
Fried pork chops?

21:10.407 --> 21:12.773
Frito pie with Wolf-brand chili?

21:12.810 --> 21:15.278
Spa-Peggy with meatballs?

21:15.312 --> 21:16.336
And a half a bottle

21:16.380 --> 21:18.314
of our wedding wine.

21:18.348 --> 21:20.748
You don't even need me
to make spa-Peggy?

21:20.784 --> 21:22.183
Nope, I guess not

21:22.219 --> 21:23.880
but that's okay.

21:23.921 --> 21:25.081
I didn't marry you

21:25.122 --> 21:27.556
because I need someone
to cook and clean for me.

21:27.591 --> 21:30.992
I married you because...
you know...

21:31.028 --> 21:35.055
you know...

21:35.098 --> 21:37.089
The love.

21:37.134 --> 21:40.001
Oh, Hank!

21:40.037 --> 21:42.062
Mmm, your hair smells
much better now.

21:42.105 --> 21:43.663
Like stuffing.

21:43.707 --> 21:46.938
[Captioned by

21:51.615 --> 21:55.176
(loud munching)

21:55.219 --> 21:59.155
Bobby, this is the best
Thanksgiving dinner I ever had.

21:59.189 --> 22:02.386
Ooh-hoo-ooh,
let's do the wishbone!

22:02.426 --> 22:05.156
This is for a million dollars.

22:05.195 --> 22:06.457
(laughing)

22:06.496 --> 22:08.259
Okay.

22:08.298 --> 22:10.766
I won! I won!

22:10.801 --> 22:12.928
You owe me a million dollars!

DALE:
Correction:

22:13.937 --> 22:16.804
You owe me a million dollars.

22:16.840 --> 22:20.298
I'm so sorry, Bobby,
he made me do it!

22:20.344 --> 22:22.107
It was all a setup.

22:22.145 --> 22:23.476

Bo, that cheese. Mm.
