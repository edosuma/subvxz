you don't realize until you lose it,
but your memory  is everything you are.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.780
Without it,you're a blank slate,

00:14.930 --> 00:19.340
reborn without points of reference,
experiences,even opinions.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.150
A child looking at the
world with new eyes.

00:25.030 --> 00:26.350
The only problem is...

00:27.710 --> 00:29.780
Samantha,is your room picked up?

00:30.320 --> 00:31.260
You're still an adult.

00:31.780 --> 00:33.790
Oh,don't you look nice,all
dressed up. Where are you going?

00:33.860 --> 00:35.840
-Just out with andrea.
-Out where?

00:35.860 --> 00:39.290
-I don't know. She's driving.
-I don't want you riding home with her.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.080
She's a drunk. Call a cab. -Okay,sure.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.920
And don't hitchhike. People are gonna
think you're a hooker dressed like that.

00:44.970 --> 00:48.230
-You just said that I look nice.
-And be home by midnight.

00:48.650 --> 00:52.930
After that,I call the police. -Midnight?
Nobody has to be home by midnight.

00:53.210 --> 00:55.540
Well,you live in this house,young
lady. You live by our rules.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.710
Well... then maybe I
won't live in this house.

00:58.070 --> 01:00.190
-Howard?
-Apologize to your mother.

01:01.460 --> 01:05.360
I'm sorry. All right,I'm gonna
go. I will return immediately

01:05.540 --> 01:07.890
and promise to die if I have any fun.

01:08.420 --> 01:10.410
What? No kiss?

01:10.660 --> 01:12.800
She's just treating me like a child.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.610
She says,as she downs
another shirley temple.

01:15.830 --> 01:19.690
Oh,but they're so good
and sweet and just pretty.

01:20.710 --> 01:23.530
They're like you. -Move
along,sweat stains.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.090
I know. Like skeet. Don't
worry. I have your back.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.200
Good,'cause you need to stay
close to me tonight,all right?

01:31.220 --> 01:33.500
'Cause I don't know what I'm supposed
to know,and I don't know who I know.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.250
Hold that thought. Hockey player !

01:40.270 --> 01:45.350
Sorry about before. But I keep looking at
you and wondering,do we know each other?

01:46.780 --> 01:47.790
It's possible.

01:48.450 --> 01:49.200
Yeah?

01:49.830 --> 01:51.060
Do you come here a lot?

01:51.090 --> 01:53.390
Also... possible.

01:55.110 --> 01:58.900
-Lots of possibilities
-Yep. You never know.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.250
-Do you wanna get out of here?
-Why? What did I do?

02:03.030 --> 02:04.640
that's funny.

02:07.550 --> 02:08.870
do you want to go to my place?

02:09.130 --> 02:12.800
Oh. Okay. Only if I can bring my
friend, though,because it's,well,

02:12.810 --> 02:16.920
it's kinda hard to explain,but
I... I need her to watch me.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.880
Must be my lucky night,

02:20.230 --> 02:22.250
It is if you wore your protective cup.

02:28.470 --> 02:31.500
why did you get rid of him? Because he
said he said that we knew each other.

02:31.510 --> 02:34.590
-Oh,you didn't. It's just a line.
-What do you mean?

02:34.600 --> 02:37.340
A line. A pick up line,you
know,to get you in bed.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.680
He wanted to have sex with me?

02:39.690 --> 02:42.470
Oh,come on. You're saying you don't
remember what it's like to be picked up?

02:43.450 --> 02:44.940
I don't remember sex.

02:45.310 --> 02:46.760
What? What are you talking about?

02:46.770 --> 02:50.650
Is that possible? Is it possible that
a person cannot remember having sex?

02:51.170 --> 02:52.260
Trust me.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.730
I'm serious. I don't remember what it's
like. I don't remember how it feels.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.840
I don't remember how
-oh,my god! You poor thing.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.310
You're a virgin!

03:06.770 --> 03:09.040
margarita!

03:09.220 --> 03:11.910
Virgin margarita,please!

03:12.150 --> 03:15.100
nothing to see here. Just an alcoholic.

03:20.590 --> 03:22.870
Note to self:Talk to Mom about sex

03:23.210 --> 03:25.850
Hey,I'm gonna go...
what are you guys doing?

03:25.970 --> 03:28.670
Oh,we're cleaning out the garage. You
know,we've been saving all this stuff

03:28.670 --> 03:31.870
that was sentimental to you,but now that
you've forgotten why,we can throw it out.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.240
-Oh,well,that's a great idea.
-yeah

03:34.250 --> 03:38.280
Um,you know what? Speaking of that,mom, uh,can
I talk to you about something kind of personal?

03:38.330 --> 03:40.240
Oh,I knew this was gonna
come up soner or later.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.700
-You did?
-Yes,honey,and don't worry.You're not dying.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.230
This happens to every
woman once a month.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.340
No,that's not it.

03:48.350 --> 03:49.470
It's about having sex.

03:50.550 --> 03:54.390
oh,good. The cookies are done. It's
not something that we discuss,I take it.

03:55.940 --> 03:58.940
Well... it--it's just that
you never brought it up before.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.720
Your father and I agreed that
if you ever did bring it up,

04:02.730 --> 04:06.590
that we would call it something
else,like "the happy touch."

04:06.600 --> 04:11.760
Okay,well,last night I realized that
the next time I do... the happy touch

04:11.770 --> 04:13.570
will be the first time
that I do the happy touch.

04:13.570 --> 04:16.140
Well,there's no need to rush into
it. The first time isn't that nice.

04:16.140 --> 04:17.540
First time for what?

04:18.110 --> 04:19.130
The happy touch.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.200
Oh,the special hug. You know,
your first time was nice.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.630
Your first time was great. -Oh,how
do you know? You weren't even there.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.860
Well,of course I was there. You
were my first time,and I was yours.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.540
Of course you were,honey...

04:35.440 --> 04:37.450
right after bob mcnally.

04:38.810 --> 04:42.470
You mean that spindly guy from the
shoe store? What are you saying to me?

04:42.810 --> 04:44.250
Great talk. I gotta go.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.610
The man handled the feet of strangers.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.470
Note to self:NEVER Talk
to Mom about sex AGAIN

04:51.480 --> 04:55.030
So what do you not know what
to do or where things go?

04:55.160 --> 05:00.860
I know where they go. I just
don't.. I don't remember them...

05:00.870 --> 05:04.260
you know... going there.

05:04.820 --> 05:09.370
You know? I don't... know how it feels. I
just,I just I don't remember what it's like.

05:09.920 --> 05:16.130
What it's like? It's like,um...it's
like... it's like,you know,it's like sex.

05:16.420 --> 05:17.580
It really is.

05:17.590 --> 05:20.160
You,you can't describe
it. -Well,just try,okay?

05:20.170 --> 05:23.620
I mean,you know,sometimes people describe
food like,"it tastes like chicken."

05:23.630 --> 05:27.430
- I will tell you this. It tastes nothing like chicken.
- Most of the time.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.260
Look,you just need to
go out and experience it.

05:30.270 --> 05:32.110
You just need to go out and do it.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.860
Well,what's the hurry? She
should wait for the right guy.

05:34.870 --> 05:38.610
Better idea: why don't you go wait for
him and call us when he gets here,huh?

05:38.620 --> 05:41.690
No,she's right. She's right. Why
why do I have to rush into this?

05:41.700 --> 05:46.130
Because it's weird. You are a grown
woman who doesn't know anything about sex.

05:46.140 --> 05:49.750
I mean,no wonder your mother treats
you like a child. You are child.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.390
Childhood is nice. You get to
order off the children's menu.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.480
they always have grilled cheese.

05:54.490 --> 05:55.920
All right,you guys are making
a big deal about this,all right?

05:55.930 --> 06:01.090
This is not some sort of infirmity,okay?
It's not like I've lost the ability to walk.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.940
Wait till you have good sex.
Look,you are an adult human woman.

06:04.950 --> 06:09.720
So much of who you are is tied up in
sex. Maybe if you go and you have it

06:09.730 --> 06:14.200
for the first time,maybe all of your
memories will just come rushing back,huh?

06:14.250 --> 06:20.140
That,or she'll... wake up with cotton candy
stuck to her back and a long walk home.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.110
The sugar?

06:23.120 --> 06:25.530
Okay,you know,I don't I don't even
wanna talk about this anymore,okay?

06:25.600 --> 06:30.300
I have plenty of time to re-experience
things,and I will get to sex

06:30.730 --> 06:32.080
when I get to it.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.620
And if it's soon...

06:36.950 --> 06:38.930
that's cool,too.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

06:48.550 --> 06:53.430
todd,could you,um,could you
just... stop... doing that?

06:53.440 --> 06:57.990
-Sorry. Uh,my mind was on something else.
-Yeah. Me,too.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.140
oh,listen,I'll get out of here in just
a sec. I just wanna get enough clothes,

07:02.180 --> 07:04.170
you know,so I don't have to keep
coming back and grabbing stuff,

07:04.170 --> 07:06.200
and we've had sex before,haven't we?

07:06.720 --> 07:08.500
-I'm sorry. What?
-Sex?

07:08.730 --> 07:12.810
Well,yeah,you know,I mean, we
were together for three years.

07:13.130 --> 07:17.270
I know we have. Of course we
have. Uh,it's just... um...

07:18.100 --> 07:20.410
-what?
-Can't remember it.

07:20.430 --> 07:21.710
Oh,well,that's flattering.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.570
No,no,no,please don't take it personally.
I don't remember french fries,either.

07:25.630 --> 07:30.150
So... I just--I don't
know. Um... what--was it...

07:30.960 --> 07:33.550
-what?
-Was it good?

07:36.760 --> 07:37.660
Yeah?

07:39.330 --> 07:40.380
Very.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.630
Really?

07:42.120 --> 07:42.870
I know.

07:46.580 --> 07:47.540
Okay,then.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.360
You good? Yeah! Pfft. Good. I'm good

07:50.410 --> 07:52.220
can't wait to try french fries.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.960
yeah,yeah,we get it.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.180
How are you today? -How am I?
I'm a virgin. That's how I am.

08:06.260 --> 08:09.690
Yes,ma'am,and I'm a pirate.
Should I call you a cab?

08:13.650 --> 08:17.870
All right,you win. I'm horny. -You're
calling me at 4:00 in the morning.

08:17.970 --> 08:21.090
You need to relax. -I was
relaxed. Now I'm horny.

08:22.740 --> 08:26.640
I cannot sleep in the same bed with
your father. He is making me crazy

08:26.650 --> 08:28.660
with this bob mcnally business.

08:28.690 --> 08:32.530
Oh,just go to sleep,please.
Just stop thinking about sex.

08:32.539 --> 08:35.799
I can't not think about it. The
more I try to not to think about it,

08:35.809 --> 08:38.289
the more I can't stop thinking
about it. It's like I'm 16 again.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.169
-17.
-What?

08:40.640 --> 08:44.440
You were 17 the first time,and I'd appreciate
you not discussing this in front of me.

08:44.450 --> 08:47.760
You're in my be
- wait a minute. How do you know when?

08:47.770 --> 08:49.790
'Cause I'm sure we didn't talk about it.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.760
Well,if you didn't want me to read
your diary,you wouldn't have left it out.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.850
I didn't tell your father,though.
It would've killed him.

08:54.920 --> 08:59.330
-you never told me a lot of things!
-Howard! Knock it off!

08:59.340 --> 09:03.350
-What is going on over there?
-Nothing. My mother's in my bed.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.480
And you wonder why you have issues. Okay,
look,just come out with me tomorrow night.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.470
Don't think about it. It'll all come
back to you. Trust me,it's just like

09:12.470 --> 09:13.380
riding a bike.

09:34.430 --> 09:37.360
oh,gosh,look,it's closed.
We gotta go. -Oh,no,no,no,

09:37.840 --> 09:39.490
You want this to happen,
or you wouldn't have come.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.980
It was an absolute mistake. I
don't know what I'm doing,okay ?

09:41.990 --> 09:46.350
I mean,what guy wants some some
clueless bimbo who doesn't know right

09:46.360 --> 09:49.180
from wrong in the bedroom?
-Oh,you have so much to learn.

09:49.190 --> 09:52.540
Yeah,yeah,you know what I have to learn?
I don't even know how to kiss,okay ?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.430
I don't even know if I'm good at it

09:54.440 --> 09:56.000
You are. Come on.

09:56.300 --> 10:00.670
-And you know this because...
-we were at a party. They offered us 300 bucks.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.060
What are you gonna do?

10:04.330 --> 10:08.540
okay,now this position we're in here,
facing the bar,this position means we just

10:08.550 --> 10:11.650
wanna talk and be left alone.
-This one. I like this one.

10:11.870 --> 10:15.460
No,you don't. Now when we're ready
to be approached,throw in a smile.

10:15.810 --> 10:16.890
Let me see a smile.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.870
We'll work on that. Okay.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.850
And we'll just rotate outward like
queens and we receive our subjects.

10:24.050 --> 10:25.730
Okay,ready? On three.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.170
One...

10:27.180 --> 10:29.970
two... three.

10:32.690 --> 10:35.250
Okay,you're being a dork. I don't
hang out with dorks,so cut it out.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.520
Okay,look,it is one thing to
talk about it,but someone in here

10:38.530 --> 10:42.010
is gonna see me naked,and I don't know
what the lighting is gonna be like.

10:42.020 --> 10:45.510
You know where there's really good
lighting? In todd's closet in his apartment.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.320
I don't know what it is,but there's a
mirror in there,and when I am looking

10:48.330 --> 10:52.920
in that mirror,I am,like,off the chain.
Is that an expression? I wanna go home.

10:53.510 --> 10:58.570
Listen to me. Listen to me. You are ready
for this. You look fabulous. The pond is big.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.010
The fish are biting.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.140
well,hello! -Ooh,and then
a boat motors through.

11:03.210 --> 11:07.210
-Ah,this is a coincidence. This is weird!
-Isn't this fun? Isn't this fun?

11:07.220 --> 11:11.520
Just all of us here,just girls. Girls
night out,right? no boys allowed!

11:12.370 --> 11:13.590
let's get you a drink.

11:13.650 --> 11:17.650
-You can't get her off the barstool,huh?
-No,she's too scared. Says she forgot how to kiss.

11:18.190 --> 11:20.450
Oh,well,do you wanna practice?
I mean,we always used to.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.760
Us,too?

11:21.790 --> 11:25.250
Well,yeah,we were 10. I mean,
maybe 11. 13 at the oldest.

11:25.340 --> 11:29.520
I am not a lesbian. No,I
think sexuality is a continuum.

11:29.550 --> 11:36.150
You're gonna be fine. I am
here,okay? Now let's go. One... two...

11:36.190 --> 11:37.470
three.

11:37.770 --> 11:43.140
Oh,there you are! Isn't this
fun,huh? Um,what are you drinking?

11:43.360 --> 11:47.640
-What--what are you doing here? -I
feel really bad about yesterday morning

11:47.650 --> 11:51.750
and how our... sex talk went. I don't want
you to think I'm one ofhose uptight mothers.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.200
I-I wanna be supportive,so come on.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.400
Let's get my little girl laid.

11:58.490 --> 12:01.500
-This is bad,right?
-Do you think? I'm out with a dork,

12:01.510 --> 12:04.960
her mother and her stalker. I look like
I'm leading the special needs field trip.

12:04.970 --> 12:06.890
Just pick someone so I can
show my face here again.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.340
I think I found him,his name is
Jason. He's turning 21 tonight,

12:11.350 --> 12:14.250
so he'll have everything you need
in a lover ignorance and gratitude.

12:14.270 --> 12:16.180
She's my daughter. I
know what she wants.

12:16.190 --> 12:19.380
Honey,how about that man
over there? Isn't he cute?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.900
-He looks like dad.
-Doesn't he?

12:22.110 --> 12:25.600
As her best friend,I think I'm more
qualified to pick a man for her than you are.

12:25.860 --> 12:27.650
That's right. I forgot
you've had them all.

12:27.660 --> 12:30.800
-Trust me. That one he should be your first.
-Honey,you want me to ask that

12:30.800 --> 12:33.010
cute man little over there if he
wants to have safe sex with you?

12:33.010 --> 12:35.460
Okay,okay,enough,enough,
enough,enough,enough! Fine.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.700
If it's so important to all of you,
I will do this,if it will make you

12:38.900 --> 12:43.420
and the tvs and the magazines and the
big pornographic cloud this morning,

12:43.430 --> 12:46.140
all of you to shut up and
leave me alone. All right.

12:46.150 --> 12:49.580
All right,who's it gonna be,huh?
Huh? Hey,hey,you,you,how about you?

12:49.590 --> 12:52.120
Uh,you,you there,come
on. Let's do this thing.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.600
-Jason.
-Jason it is.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.870
Happy birthday,jason.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.680
Don't wait up.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.390
Sleep with Jason

13:19.010 --> 13:26.010
-so... that kissing thing...
-yeah,me,too. We should do that Ahem. Okay.

13:30.230 --> 13:34.390
dave,I told you,no "guitar hero"
tonight!  I will come back there...

13:34.390 --> 13:35.890
and I will kick your ass!

13:37.490 --> 13:38.590
Roommate.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.730
Yeah,you you think he might come out?

13:40.790 --> 13:44.860
Oh,he hasn't been out in,like,a year.
Dave's always totally wasted,and I'm like,

13:44.870 --> 13:47.740
"dude,get a job," and he's
like,"dude--" -okay,yeah,whoo! Shh!

13:48.300 --> 13:50.430
Okay. Sorry. Just just a
little nervous,you know?

13:50.440 --> 13:56.190
Oh,don'T. No,no. Don't be,because
you know what? This is no big deal,

13:56.280 --> 14:02.510
because this is natural. This is just
this is two adults just doing the deed,

14:02.550 --> 14:06.380
you know? Just... bing-bang,boom. Okay?

14:07.020 --> 14:10.350
Yeah,see,that's how I knew
you were the right one tonight,

14:10.730 --> 14:13.820
because I just want my
first time to be great. -Huh?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.990
Oh. Damn it!

14:18.260 --> 14:20.660
God,stupid,stupid,stupid!

14:21.740 --> 14:24.870
-you're a virgin?
-Oh,yeah,don't be mad.

14:25.350 --> 14:28.020
Look,it was my friends' idea to
take me out tonight to get me laid.

14:28.020 --> 14:33.290
Sorry. Being pressured into
having sex god,how lame is that?

14:34.070 --> 14:35.340
that's so lame.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.100
you wanna see me play the
drums? Some girls like that.

14:42.130 --> 14:46.850
No,jason,look,I'm sorry. I really
don't think that I should be your first.

14:46.880 --> 14:53.360
-Why not? Because you're old?
-No. Because... you know,you're

14:53.580 --> 14:57.520
you're a nice guy,and I think that
your first should should not be

14:57.530 --> 15:02.970
with a stranger. It should be with someone
who you,I don't know,who you connect with,

15:02.980 --> 15:05.040
who you have some sort
of history,you know?

15:05.050 --> 15:09.600
Just someone who you...
someone who cares about you.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.210
Oh,man.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.070
Wait.

15:14.190 --> 15:15.980
Let's do it in the hall.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.920
I like it when the old lady next
door glares at me in the morning.

15:19.270 --> 15:20.450
Oh,I don't think so.

15:20.610 --> 15:23.500
Um,listen Sam I like you

15:23.510 --> 15:25.500
look,you don't have to
say that to get me in bed.

15:25.510 --> 15:27.900
The deal was sealed when I stuffed
my underwear in your pocket.

15:27.910 --> 15:30.250
No,I mean,I like you a lot.

15:30.260 --> 15:33.130
-Okay,well,let's do it a lot.
-No,I'm being serious.

15:33.390 --> 15:37.570
Oh,right,I'm sorry. I'll
put on my serious face.

15:40.710 --> 15:41.990
look,uh,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.910
my mistake,I know,but I guess
I care about you. Sue me.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.260
And if we do this,I'm gonna
care about you even more,

15:47.290 --> 15:50.510
and if you don't feel the
same,it's fine, but then let's not.

15:53.830 --> 15:55.330
You are such a girl.

15:55.570 --> 15:57.660
And you're a pain in the ass.

16:00.170 --> 16:01.130
Okay.

16:01.220 --> 16:02.050
Yeah?

16:07.020 --> 16:09.390
But you know that speech? -Yeah?

16:09.410 --> 16:11.680
That better not be the longest
thing that you do tonight.

16:15.070 --> 16:18.630
Hey,you okay? You didn't,like,
have stroke,did you?

16:18.640 --> 16:22.520
Because my grandma did that,and it was
-no! No,look,I have to go,all right?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.130
Don't hurry,okay?

16:27.200 --> 16:30.900
The right person,just wait for
that right person. He is out there.

16:31.290 --> 16:31.840
He?

16:32.110 --> 16:34.690
You know,"she," whatever,
'cause I don't judge.

16:35.490 --> 16:38.020
Sleep with Todd

16:40.210 --> 16:42.750
hey. Um,can I talk to
you for just a second?

16:42.820 --> 16:48.820
Um,look,I just wanted to say that that you
and I have known each other for a long time,

16:48.840 --> 16:51.710
and,you know,we can't just
forget those years,right?

16:52.020 --> 16:54.620
I mean,I can,and I already have,

16:55.130 --> 16:57.950
but I hear that they were
good, and maybe not all of them,

16:57.960 --> 17:00.430
but I know that it started out
well, and how often do you connect

17:00.610 --> 17:07.270
with people on that level? Well,you know,
you you've got that closetwith the lighting

17:07.280 --> 17:08.369
and the mirror and everything,
so I was just wondering if you--

17:08.380 --> 17:13.030
-Todd,who is it?
-Oh,um... just Sam.

17:15.550 --> 17:16.390
Hi.

17:16.920 --> 17:17.829
Hi.

17:21.849 --> 17:23.050
What's going on ?

17:23.069 --> 17:24.660
This is julia.

17:27.420 --> 17:30.530
-I'm--I'm gonna go start
the movie. -Yeah,you do that.

17:30.840 --> 17:35.050
Yeah,I'll be there in a second.
what is going on with you?

17:35.160 --> 17:38.550
Nothing. Pfft. Nothing. I just came by
to say hi. That's all. Can't I come by

17:38.560 --> 17:40.470
and--and--and
say hi? -Sure. Hi.

17:40.480 --> 17:44.210
So she,um,she seems
nice. She's very pretty.

17:44.240 --> 17:44.950
Oh,thanks.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.660
I didn't say you were
pretty. I said she was pretty.

17:48.260 --> 17:49.770
-Have you been drinking?
-Why? Have you?

17:49.780 --> 17:50.920
No,I'm not the one acting strange.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.460
Well,I'm not the one with
a girl in my apartment.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.230
So I'm not supposed to see other people?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.970
Why--why would I care if
you saw other people,todd?

17:57.460 --> 18:01.200
I don't have feelings for you.
you didn't understand that?

18:02.610 --> 18:04.950
-Well,you're acting very jealous.
-Jealous?

18:05.710 --> 18:10.950
Um,how is it possible to be jealous
of someone you can't remember,huh?

18:11.460 --> 18:13.960
Hmm? Answer? It's not.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.030
Okay,you know what? I really
gotta go. Yeah,so do I,

18:16.040 --> 18:19.060
'cause you know what? It's almost
midnight,and that's my... curfew.

18:22.330 --> 18:23.330
bye,michelle.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.280
-It's... julia.
-Whatever.

18:35.150 --> 18:36.360
Ms. Newly.

18:37.060 --> 18:41.700
Hey,frank. Guess what?
I'm not a virgin anymore.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.190
And apparently not a cuddler.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.500
Sleep ALONE

18:55.320 --> 18:59.690
Hi. I'll sleep downstairs.
-Nonsense. Come on.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.050
Come here.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.780
I shouldn't have gone
to that place tonight.

19:17.730 --> 19:23.020
I guess I just wanted us to be better
at talking about things,this time around.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.590
Well,thanks.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.070
Me,too.

19:29.470 --> 19:31.810
Just don't ever come there again.

19:41.820 --> 19:42.900
What happened with that boy?

19:43.980 --> 19:45.820
-Nothin'.
-Oh,I'm sorry.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.010
No,I'm not.

19:49.910 --> 19:54.130
I'm not sorry at all. I'm glad. Like it
or not,you'll always be my little girl.

19:56.750 --> 20:00.300
And the truth is,I want you to
save yourself for someone special.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.720
-Or just throw yourself
at a shoe salesman!

20:03.210 --> 20:05.150
Howard,shut up.

20:05.980 --> 20:09.070
I only did it with bob mcnally in the
first place because I didn't wanna act

20:09.070 --> 20:10.690
like an idiot when I met the man I love.

20:11.820 --> 20:13.390
You know,dad,if it means anything

20:13.400 --> 20:16.230
she did try to hook me up
with a guy who looks like you.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.940
Is that true ?

20:33.910 --> 20:35.750
At least someone's doing it around here,

20:36.030 --> 20:39.550
and,hey,I did remember what
it was like. It was like,um,

20:39.550 --> 20:42.850
well,it definitely was not like chicken,

20:44.460 --> 20:48.050
and I will probably do it again
when the right guy comes around.

20:49.820 --> 20:51.270
And now I know that they do.

21:01.030 --> 21:02.480
when it does happen though...

21:04.700 --> 21:07.230
I will definitely be ready.
