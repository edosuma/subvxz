00:00.123 --> 00:01.249
Whose car is it?

00:01.290 --> 00:05.454
I'm on a bounty system now. Cash bonus
for everyone I pull out of the deadly surf.

00:06.763 --> 00:08.230
I got it. Help me.

00:08.264 --> 00:11.358
You can make it!
Get up! Get up! That's it. Nice play.

00:11.401 --> 00:14.370
How come he never mentioned your name?

00:14.404 --> 00:17.862
- You're being very rude.
- Is that a major offense with you?

00:17.907 --> 00:20.307
If it is, what would you consider murder?

00:20.343 --> 00:22.368
I sure hope that doesn't happen to you.

00:25.081 --> 00:27.311
That's it.

01:36.319 --> 01:40.779
<i>Hawaii's a country of the mind.
It promotes delusions of immortality.</i>

01:40.823 --> 01:43.986
<i>I mean, without seasons,
it's all just sunsets.</i>

01:44.026 --> 01:47.154
<i>People may die, but they never get older</i>.

01:47.196 --> 01:48.720
I got it. Help me.

01:48.764 --> 01:52.131
You can make it!
Get up! Get up! That's it. Nice play.

01:54.770 --> 01:58.604
Get this one and we're out of here.
Not that I'm putting on the pressure.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.973
Right. No pressure, partner.

02:04.113 --> 02:06.445
OK, partner. Here we go.

02:06.482 --> 02:09.451
<i>Take my good friend Marcus, for example</i>.

02:09.485 --> 02:14.081
<i>I woke up one day and realized I was 32
and I'd never had a chance to be 22.</i>

02:14.123 --> 02:17.320
<i>Marcus? Marcus was my mirror image</i>.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.521
<i>On the calendar he was closing in on 30,</i>

02:19.562 --> 02:22.690
<i>but in many ways, he was still 22</i>.

02:22.732 --> 02:25.394
- I got it. Help me.
- You can make it. Get up! Get up!

02:25.434 --> 02:27.425
Good.

02:28.771 --> 02:30.534
Go, go, go!

02:30.573 --> 02:34.737
Get that! Get up! That's it. Nice play.

02:42.618 --> 02:47.453
Marcus, I'm a little worried about Saunders.
He's hitting a lot better with Kovak setting up.

02:47.490 --> 02:50.584
- No problem. I got him covered.
- I'm serious. I'm worried.

02:50.626 --> 02:52.753
Don't be. It just causes wrinkles.

02:59.969 --> 03:01.266
Thank you.

03:07.977 --> 03:09.274
Marcus?

03:10.313 --> 03:12.406
It's not a Ferrari, but what is?

03:12.448 --> 03:14.439
Hey, wait a second.

03:14.483 --> 03:18.010
Lifeguards, even senior guards, don't drive...

03:18.054 --> 03:22.616
- Come on. Whose car is it, Marcus?
- Hard work and thrift, partner.

03:22.658 --> 03:26.424
I'm on a bounty system. Cash bonus
for everyone I pull out of the surf.

03:26.462 --> 03:29.454
- Come on, Marcus.
- I gotta go. I got that appointment.

03:29.498 --> 03:31.898
I'll see you at the tournament. Remember...

03:31.934 --> 03:34.425
No pressure. Right.

03:39.942 --> 03:43.434
<i>When I write my book on
how to be a world-class private investigator,</i>

03:43.479 --> 03:47.108
<i>I'm going to include a chapter
on listening to your little voice.</i>

03:47.149 --> 03:50.175
<i>Everyone has one
and mine told me to stop Marcus</i>

03:50.219 --> 03:52.915
<i>and find out the real story
behind his new car.</i>

03:52.955 --> 03:56.118
<i>Of course, I didn't</i>.
<i>And that's another chapter</i> -

03:56.158 --> 03:58.752
<i>Things I Should Have Done But Didn't</i>.

04:17.012 --> 04:19.345
- Hello.
- <i>Thomas. Rick</i>.

04:19.382 --> 04:23.318
Rick? It's five in the morning.
You're in trouble, huh?

04:23.352 --> 04:25.081
<i>I'm not in trouble. Listen</i>.

04:25.121 --> 04:27.180
Then what are you waking me up for?

04:27.223 --> 04:30.488
I got a big tournament tomorrow.
I gotta get some rest.

04:30.526 --> 04:32.255
<i>Thomas, it's bad news</i>.

04:32.295 --> 04:34.160
Oh, yeah. I know.

04:34.196 --> 04:38.132
<i>Your friend Marcus. You'd better get down
to Sandy Beach right away.</i>

04:47.943 --> 04:50.411
Apparently he was out for a midnight swim.

04:50.446 --> 04:53.347
Got caught in a tide.
It pulled him around the reef.

04:53.382 --> 04:56.510
- Crashed his body against the rock.
- He's a lifeguard.

04:56.552 --> 05:00.454
- Listen, you know as well as me...
- He couldn't have drowned.

05:00.489 --> 05:04.016
- Always possible. It's a mistake.
- He's too good an athlete.

05:04.060 --> 05:07.120
That's why we need a positive identification.

05:07.163 --> 05:09.154
- This way.
- Marcus!

05:09.198 --> 05:11.098
- Nancy.
- Marcus!

05:11.133 --> 05:13.727
No! No! No!

05:39.795 --> 05:41.820
- Magnum.
- Wait a minute.

05:44.066 --> 05:45.590
OK?

05:47.203 --> 05:50.468
- Just wait here. Please.
- OK.

05:55.344 --> 05:57.676
<i>Nancy was Marcus's kid sister</i>.

05:57.713 --> 06:01.672
<i>She came out here three years ago
from Illinois to find some excitement.</i>

06:01.717 --> 06:06.211
<i>She wanted to be a tour guide. You know,
see the islands and get paid for it.</i>

06:41.657 --> 06:46.151
I don't want to talk about him
or think about him or remember him again.

06:47.062 --> 06:50.054
He was a 30-year-old teenager
that never grew up.

06:52.668 --> 06:57.037
I don't know. I thought he was starting to
and then he pulls this stunt on me and dies.

06:57.072 --> 07:01.634
Nancy. That's just it. He didn't do anything.
I don't think it was an accident.

07:01.677 --> 07:06.376
I don't want to hear about it.
Just stay away from me. Let this be.

07:06.415 --> 07:09.782
He's your brother, for God's sakes.
You can't just walk away.

07:09.819 --> 07:13.050
Why not? He's dead, isn't he?

07:13.088 --> 07:16.023
Leave me alone. Leave him alone.

07:16.058 --> 07:19.721
- Isn't his death enough?
- No, it's not.

07:22.498 --> 07:24.864
You don't think so either.

07:27.102 --> 07:30.003
Marcus was more than my brother.

07:32.241 --> 07:34.436
He was my best friend.

07:37.079 --> 07:40.742
When I came out from Illinois,
he got me an apartment.

07:41.684 --> 07:44.380
Thomas, he was so beautiful.

07:45.921 --> 07:48.515
That's what I want to remember.

07:48.557 --> 07:50.354
Please.

08:21.223 --> 08:24.192
<i>I was never any good at funerals</i>.

08:24.226 --> 08:27.218
<i>When they buried Marcus,
I said goodbye to him my own way,</i>

08:27.263 --> 08:30.460
<i>where we'd spent our friendship,
at the beach.</i>

08:30.499 --> 08:34.059
<i>But before his face and name
became part of my memory,</i>

08:34.102 --> 08:36.400
<i>there was one more thing I had to do</i>.

08:36.438 --> 08:39.532
<i>That was listen to my little voice. This time</i>.

08:39.575 --> 08:41.941
<i>It was talking about Marcus's new car</i>.

08:41.977 --> 08:46.107
<i>He never had two nickels to rub together,
but the day after he showed up with it,</i>

08:46.148 --> 08:48.412
<i>they pulled his body off the reef</i>.

09:02.998 --> 09:05.626
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

09:05.668 --> 09:08.136
- You leave me alone.
- It's OK.

09:08.170 --> 09:11.697
No, it's not. Don't touch me.

09:11.740 --> 09:14.641
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.

09:14.677 --> 09:18.010
Yeah, great. So you say.

09:18.047 --> 09:20.481
Who are you, anyway?

09:20.516 --> 09:23.246
My name's Thomas Magnum. I'm...

09:23.285 --> 09:26.686
I was a friend of Marcus's
and I'm also a private investigator.

09:27.590 --> 09:31.219
OK. My name's Daisy Spencer.

09:31.260 --> 09:34.024
I just got off a plane from Cincinnati, Ohio.

09:35.097 --> 09:37.861
I was Marcus's fiancée.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.734
If you're such a great friend,
how come he never mentioned your name?

09:41.770 --> 09:43.601
I could ask you the same question.

09:45.808 --> 09:49.676
Look, we just played volleyball together.
He was my partner.

09:49.712 --> 09:51.976
- I just thought that...
- How much?

09:52.915 --> 09:54.712
What?

09:54.750 --> 09:59.050
- Oh, no, I'm not on this case.
- I'd be happy to pay for your services.

09:59.088 --> 10:02.785
No, it's not the issue. It's just...

10:04.126 --> 10:06.651
Look, Miss Spencer...

10:06.695 --> 10:09.721
I wouldn't hesitate
if there was any real evidence,

10:09.765 --> 10:14.168
anything tangible that would indicate
his drowning wasn't accidental.

10:14.203 --> 10:17.570
Marcus was a strong,
almost world-class swimmer.

10:18.540 --> 10:24.240
- I know that.
- Clear skies, calm sea, no unusual tides.

10:24.279 --> 10:29.546
The first thing I did after his father called me
and broke the news

10:29.585 --> 10:32.679
was phone the police.

10:32.721 --> 10:35.656
- They told me that they...
- Fine. Fine.

10:35.691 --> 10:38.216
What they didn't tell you is his sister Nancy

10:38.260 --> 10:42.162
is one of the loveliest
and most gentle girls I've ever met.

10:42.197 --> 10:44.722
And his death really tore her apart.

10:44.767 --> 10:48.464
I'll be damned if I'm gonna open things up
and hurt her unnecessarily

10:48.504 --> 10:51.029
because of your long-distance logic.

10:53.409 --> 10:58.938
Besides, the police think the coroner's report
is going to be accidental death.

10:58.981 --> 11:02.007
They don't even have an active investigation.

11:04.153 --> 11:07.384
Then what are you doing here?

11:17.266 --> 11:20.030
<i>It was not my best afternoon ever</i>.

11:20.069 --> 11:23.732
<i>Marcus's fiancée had hit me in the spot
already rubbed raw by Nancy.</i>

11:23.772 --> 11:26.764
<i>What I wanted was
a long swim in the tidal pool</i>

11:26.809 --> 11:30.108
<i>followed by a steak
and an exceptional bottle of wine.</i>

11:30.145 --> 11:33.114
- <i>What I got instead was</i>...
- Magnum.

11:33.148 --> 11:36.948
One moment, please, if you don't mind.

11:36.985 --> 11:39.749
You know those tide charts
you mentioned you needed?

11:39.788 --> 11:43.952
I dropped by the Office
of Oceanographic Affairs during my lunch hour

11:43.992 --> 11:46.620
and had the currents specially marked.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.425
- You did?
- Of course.

11:48.464 --> 11:50.955
Chums enjoy doing favors for one another.

11:50.999 --> 11:54.025
- Chums?
- Of course.

11:56.705 --> 11:59.970
- Will you stop that?
- What?

12:00.008 --> 12:04.104
That awful smiling.
You're up to something. Some kind of a trick.

12:04.146 --> 12:07.946
Actually, I'm in the rare position
of having to ask a favor of you.

12:07.983 --> 12:11.680
- An insignificant one, of course.
- What is it, Higgins?

12:11.720 --> 12:15.747
The Aloha Historical Society has named me
its first non-native chairman

12:15.791 --> 12:19.591
for the preservation of structures
of significant architectural value.

12:19.628 --> 12:24.088
As a fundraiser for the next three weekends,
with Mr. Masters' permission,

12:24.133 --> 12:26.567
the Society will sell tours of the grounds.

12:26.602 --> 12:28.763
Here? At the estate?

12:28.804 --> 12:32.365
A bunch of little old ladies
with blue hair running around...

12:32.407 --> 12:35.672
Ladies of old families, gently reared and bred,

12:35.711 --> 12:40.614
concepts I reali <i>z</i> e are totally alien
to a man of your obvious, vulgar tastes.

12:40.649 --> 12:46.246
Eating cucumber sandwiches and wearing
those funny 30-year-old suits, and no make-up.

12:46.288 --> 12:50.987
Obviously a modicum of sensitivity,
a certain decorum while they're about,

12:51.026 --> 12:54.052
is impossible to expect
from you and your friends.

12:54.096 --> 12:57.691
Therefore my request is that you
absent yourself from the grounds

12:57.733 --> 13:00.702
from sunrise Saturday to sunset on Sunday.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.432
What? Wait a minute.

13:03.472 --> 13:05.736
This is my home too, remember.

13:05.774 --> 13:09.471
- You won't do me the favor?
- Absolutely not.

13:11.346 --> 13:13.507
How depressingly short-sighted of you.

13:13.549 --> 13:17.952
I thought you'd see the wisdom of this
because in return for this insignificant...

13:17.986 --> 13:22.355
Insignificant? You call moving out
for three weekends insignificant?

13:22.391 --> 13:24.951
Certain past indiscretions.

13:24.993 --> 13:28.394
Various incriminating lapses noted in my log.

13:28.430 --> 13:34.562
Higgins, there is nothing that you can tell
Robin that he doesn't already know,

13:34.603 --> 13:36.503
that we haven't laughed about.

13:36.538 --> 13:39.939
The potato chip heiress from Buffalo
who filled the tidal pool with...

13:39.975 --> 13:43.536
A little misunderstanding, Higgins.
After it was drained...

13:43.579 --> 13:48.073
Then there was
the Romanian mime troupe who...

13:48.116 --> 13:54.214
Eugh. You're not gonna bring that up.
You were here when the paramedics arrived.

13:54.256 --> 13:59.353
I will take note of your panic and those
guilt-cra <i>z</i> ed eyes as assent to my favor,

13:59.394 --> 14:02.454
- albeit with the slightest reluctance.
- Wait a minute!

14:02.497 --> 14:06.433
This isn't a favor, it's extortion and blackmail.

14:06.468 --> 14:10.996
It's a gentlemen's agreement, though
under the circumstances the term is misused.

14:11.039 --> 14:14.600
Wait a minute, Higgins.
We can talk about this. We can...

14:14.643 --> 14:16.975
Good day, chum.

14:18.146 --> 14:20.808
We can talk about this.

14:23.151 --> 14:25.142
Aaah! Ow!

14:26.722 --> 14:29.156
- What?
- <i>Never mind. I'll call back</i>.

14:29.191 --> 14:32.524
Rick, no. I'm sorry. What have you got?

14:32.561 --> 14:34.426
<i>I got the skinny on Marcus's car</i>.

14:34.463 --> 14:36.488
<i>It was leased by Chase Shipping</i>.

14:36.531 --> 14:39.432
- You got an address?
- <i>Grab a pencil</i>.

14:41.169 --> 14:44.696
<i>The address Rick came up with
was a big white house in Kahala,</i>

14:44.740 --> 14:49.006
<i>complete with the Bentley and the same
elegant blonde I'd seen outside the club</i>

14:49.044 --> 14:52.343
<i>the last day I saw Marcus alive</i>.

15:04.059 --> 15:08.189
What are you doing?
I thought you weren't investigating this case.

15:08.230 --> 15:10.698
- I'm not.
- Oh?

15:10.732 --> 15:14.133
- So why are you so interested in that car?
- None of your business.

15:14.169 --> 15:16.933
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- I won't excuse you.

15:16.972 --> 15:21.204
Because I'm a detective undercover
for the Honolulu Police.

15:21.243 --> 15:24.303
You're interfering in an official investigation.

15:32.036 --> 15:36.029
<i>So the little rich girl from Cincinnati
turned out to be an undercover cop</i>

15:36.074 --> 15:38.133
<i>complete with badge and a subtle threat</i>

15:38.176 --> 15:42.044
<i>of making my life miserable
if I didn't cooperate with the Department.</i>

15:42.080 --> 15:44.674
<i>Although I was still upset
about being lied to,</i>

15:44.716 --> 15:48.152
<i>I was, of course,
too professional to let it show.</i>

15:48.186 --> 15:50.780
Why didn't you tell me you were a cop?

15:50.822 --> 15:53.689
That's undercover detective.

15:53.725 --> 15:58.128
Until you started working on the case,
how did I know you weren't one of the killers?

15:58.162 --> 16:01.689
- Then the police think it's murder.
- It's a theory.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.693
Call me Tracy.
As long as we're working on the same case...

16:06.738 --> 16:10.230
We're not both working on the case. We're...

16:10.274 --> 16:13.505
On the trail of the prime suspect.

16:20.918 --> 16:23.148
- No, thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

16:31.996 --> 16:34.658
- Thank you.
- That's two dollars, please.

16:38.636 --> 16:42.197
- All I have is a five.
- Thank you.

16:48.246 --> 16:50.476
Don't look so worried.

16:50.515 --> 16:54.815
There's nothing to be concerned about.
Her husband's in Vancouver.

16:54.852 --> 16:58.652
Besides, I kind of enjoy this.

16:58.690 --> 17:01.750
That's because your menu
doesn't have prices on it.

17:01.793 --> 17:06.162
Not that I mind dining out
in a nice restaurant. It's just that...

17:06.196 --> 17:09.758
Lately I've been putting a lot of money
back into my business.

17:09.800 --> 17:16.468
Well, look. When you're stalking big game,
you've got to go into the jungle.

17:19.911 --> 17:22.402
- Take my hand.
- What?

17:22.446 --> 17:24.642
Take my hand.

17:28.886 --> 17:32.413
It's supposed to be a date,
not Indian wrestling.

17:34.158 --> 17:36.786
Now smile into my eyes.

17:36.828 --> 17:39.854
- What?
- Now laugh.

17:39.897 --> 17:43.128
Because her friend
is going to the powder room.

17:47.672 --> 17:50.573
I'll just make sure
that she doesn't come right back.

17:51.876 --> 17:55.073
It's called division of labor.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.486
- Miss Chase?
- Yes?

18:09.527 --> 18:13.156
My name's Thomas Magnum.
We have a mutual friend. May I join you?

18:13.197 --> 18:15.324
I already have a luncheon companion.

18:15.366 --> 18:17.561
I believe you do too.

18:19.036 --> 18:21.027
Well...

18:22.940 --> 18:25.374
Our mutual friend is dead.

18:26.644 --> 18:30.375
I was trying to find out why.
I was just hoping you could help me out.

18:30.414 --> 18:34.851
- You're being very rude, Mr. Magnum.
- Is that a major offense with you?

18:34.886 --> 18:37.650
If it is, what would you consider murder?

18:37.688 --> 18:39.986
Are you a policeman?

18:40.024 --> 18:43.585
Much worse. I'm a private investigator.

18:43.628 --> 18:46.096
And why do you think this young man
was murdered?

18:46.130 --> 18:48.155
That's not the question.

18:48.199 --> 18:52.659
The question is why was this young man
driving an expensive sports car

18:52.703 --> 18:55.672
leased for you by your husband's company?

18:57.875 --> 19:00.673
You're so intense.

19:00.711 --> 19:03.680
I wish I had some sinister answer for you.

19:03.714 --> 19:06.376
But the truth is that he worked
for my husband and me

19:06.417 --> 19:09.250
as a part-time house boy,
bartending at our parties.

19:09.287 --> 19:14.281
He had to pick up supplies and his car
broke down so I loaned him that one.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.793
If you wish, you can ask my husband.

19:16.828 --> 19:20.127
He can tell you everything you want to know
about the young man.

19:20.164 --> 19:23.099
Marcus.

19:23.134 --> 19:26.763
He wasn't "the young man". He had a name.

19:28.739 --> 19:31.264
You know, you were wrong.

19:32.210 --> 19:36.613
Rudeness isn't a crime. It's just a terrible bore.

19:37.215 --> 19:39.308
Good day.

19:46.257 --> 19:49.090
I'll just drop you off at your car,

19:49.126 --> 19:51.651
and then we're gonna call it quits, right?

19:51.696 --> 19:56.793
OK? The Department will reimburse me
for dinner and the breakfast, right?

19:56.834 --> 19:58.734
- Wrong.
- What?

19:58.769 --> 20:04.173
The Department's interested in that little
black book you lifted from Marcus's drawer.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.176
- You saw...
- Mm-hm.

20:06.210 --> 20:09.270
Now turn around. We're going to your house.

20:09.313 --> 20:11.611
- Now look...
- Because if you don't,

20:11.649 --> 20:13.879
I'm going to impound it as evidence.

20:13.918 --> 20:14.907
Turn left.

20:14.952 --> 20:18.115
Now wait a minute. If you think I'm gonna...

20:31.802 --> 20:35.499
I say, Magnum.
As usual, your timing couldn't be worse.

20:35.539 --> 20:38.064
I assumed you'd be
freeloading at the club all day

20:38.109 --> 20:40.339
so I scheduled my first committee luncheon.

20:40.378 --> 20:44.610
Now it could most delicately be described
as a compromising situation.

20:44.649 --> 20:49.609
Don't get excited. In 15 minutes,
ten if I'm lucky, she will be out of here.

20:51.322 --> 20:54.621
Tracy Spencer,
Honolulu Police Department.

20:54.659 --> 20:58.288
Are you, by chance,
the Jonathan Quayle Higgins?

20:58.329 --> 21:04.165
I find that appellation a bit pretentious,
but yes, I am.

21:04.201 --> 21:06.669
Well, you're far too modest.

21:06.704 --> 21:09.901
We're quite familiar
with your outstanding record

21:09.941 --> 21:13.638
with the Prince of Wales'
Own West Yorkshire Regiment.

21:13.678 --> 21:17.774
As a matter of fact,
I have a private theory of my own,

21:17.815 --> 21:21.751
one which I haven't shared with
the other members of the detective bureau...

21:21.786 --> 21:25.017
- Oh, brother.
- Magnum, please.

21:25.056 --> 21:27.286
Let this young lady continue.

21:27.325 --> 21:29.259
As a matter of fact,

21:29.293 --> 21:35.289
I often wonder
how a man of Magnum's limited background

21:35.333 --> 21:38.734
has been able to crack
so many difficult cases.

21:38.769 --> 21:41.670
You're not alone, Miss Spencer,
I can assure you.

21:42.974 --> 21:44.566
Tracy.

21:44.608 --> 21:48.374
Until I learned that he was
a guest at this estate.

21:49.714 --> 21:52.581
You must be his mentor.

21:52.616 --> 21:56.052
I? Involved in Magnum's
sordid divorce cases?

21:56.087 --> 22:00.717
The keen eye, the cool head,
the Renaissance mind

22:00.758 --> 22:05.821
could only come from a man
with your impeccable background and taste.

22:05.863 --> 22:08.354
Confess. Am I right?

22:10.468 --> 22:15.201
I suppose modestly, from time to time,
I do help out a bit, yes.

22:15.239 --> 22:18.731
Enough. If you want to look at the book,
you gotta do it right now.

22:18.776 --> 22:22.109
Lovely to meet you. Official business.

22:27.151 --> 22:29.745
"Renaissance mind."

22:29.787 --> 22:31.914
"Cool head." Cream?

22:31.956 --> 22:35.357
A little PR never hurt. Please.

22:35.393 --> 22:38.419
You know a lady named Rose?

22:38.462 --> 22:40.726
No. What's her address?

22:40.765 --> 22:44.667
Somewhere near
the Chinese Cultural Center. No number.

22:44.702 --> 22:46.761
There you are.

22:48.672 --> 22:51.698
Are you trying to horn in
on my investigation?

22:51.742 --> 22:54.768
Your investigation? I most certainly am not.

22:54.812 --> 23:00.682
Good. Because civilians only muck up
this kind of investigation so don't even...

23:00.718 --> 23:02.242
"Muck up"?

23:02.286 --> 23:07.189
Look, Tracy, or whatever your name
happens to be at this particular moment,

23:07.224 --> 23:08.657
I am a professional.

23:08.692 --> 23:14.597
I happen to get paid... lots, lots of money,
to solve cases just like this one.

23:15.332 --> 23:17.892
So you wanna make a deal? Work together?

23:19.370 --> 23:21.736
No deals.

23:21.772 --> 23:23.706
It's unusual, it's irregular,

23:23.741 --> 23:27.643
and I'm only willing to cooperate
because you'll just keep at it anyway.

23:27.678 --> 23:33.139
But if they find out about this down
at headquarters, I'm in very big trouble.

23:33.184 --> 23:36.176
I already told you. No deals.

23:41.692 --> 23:44.252
<i>I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.</i>

23:44.295 --> 23:46.593
<i>I should have stuck with no deals</i>.

23:46.630 --> 23:49.155
<i>But two heads were better than one</i>.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.569
<i>And besides, the experience
and streetwise acumen of a police detective</i>

23:53.604 --> 23:55.469
<i>might come in handy</i>.

24:05.683 --> 24:08.015
Sure, I know him.

24:09.220 --> 24:12.621
But his name isn't Marcus. It's Sean.

24:12.656 --> 24:14.647
He worked down here? Are you sure?

24:14.692 --> 24:17.183
A guy who looked like that? I'd remember.

24:17.228 --> 24:20.561
Every time he said hello,
my brain turned to tapioca.

24:20.598 --> 24:23.465
Kinda like now.

24:24.535 --> 24:28.301
Did he sell aloha shirts, or maps?

24:28.339 --> 24:32.571
Oh, no. He was a class act.
Nothing but top-grade merchandise.

24:32.610 --> 24:35.204
Good watches. Great little tape-players.

24:35.246 --> 24:39.182
- You could tell he was quality.
- Do you know where he got the stuff?

24:39.216 --> 24:42.845
Down here, mister, you don't ask questions.

24:49.293 --> 24:53.423
- You're not a cop, are you?
- No, I'm just a friend.

24:53.464 --> 24:57.696
Marcus... Sean... turned up dead
in the ocean. I think somebody killed him.

24:58.836 --> 25:00.531
Oh, damn.

25:04.175 --> 25:06.143
Listen. Thanks.

25:07.778 --> 25:10.144
Hey, friend of Sean.

25:14.752 --> 25:17.118
One thing, one funny thing about Sean.

25:17.154 --> 25:20.385
By the end of the day,
he'd have a real wad of money.

25:21.492 --> 25:25.360
- Yeah?
- He was never nervous about carrying it.

25:25.396 --> 25:29.628
Around this neighborhood,
a bankroll can make you an instant neurotic.

25:30.935 --> 25:33.699
Unless you got some real protection.

25:35.072 --> 25:37.267
Sounds like his ran out too soon.

25:40.110 --> 25:42.578
I sure hope that doesn't happen to you.

25:59.496 --> 26:02.863
Excuse me, mister, but there seems to be
a problem with your car.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.698
- What?
- Maybe you better come with us.

26:05.736 --> 26:08.227
I'd be glad to.
That car's very important to me.

26:08.272 --> 26:10.103
It should be.

26:15.412 --> 26:17.403
This is not where my car is parked.

26:18.382 --> 26:20.748
Girls, do you want to tell me
what's going on?

26:20.784 --> 26:24.413
If this is a robbery, I got about eight bucks.

26:24.455 --> 26:28.915
Here. You want my watch?
It cost about $17.95 at the...

26:28.959 --> 26:30.517
Come on!

26:33.464 --> 26:36.831
That's enough.
I've never hit a woman before...

26:36.867 --> 26:41.600
Maybe it's about time you suddenly started,
before it's too late.

26:41.639 --> 26:44.130
That's it.

26:54.852 --> 26:58.288
See, Rose doesn't like anybody
snooping in this territory.

26:58.322 --> 27:02.156
- Do you understand?
- Free <i>z</i> e! Police!

27:15.172 --> 27:18.005
Are you all right?

27:18.042 --> 27:21.307
Why didn't you pull your gun?

27:21.345 --> 27:26.305
Because it got stuck... in my make-up case.

27:36.842 --> 27:39.504
I mean this
in the very best sort of way.

27:39.545 --> 27:42.514
Have you ever considered
taking a self-defense course?

27:42.548 --> 27:45.711
- They were women.
- That's my point.

27:47.253 --> 27:49.653
Poor thing. Aw!

27:50.723 --> 27:53.317
Oh, good, Magnum. You're here...

27:53.359 --> 27:56.123
Good Lord. Are you all right?

27:56.161 --> 27:59.096
- Oh, no, I'm fine.
- Is she all right?

27:59.131 --> 28:02.294
Is she all right? Higgins, look at my body.

28:02.334 --> 28:05.269
I'm not blind, Magnum.

28:05.304 --> 28:09.001
I can see that you look like bloody hell.

28:09.041 --> 28:14.274
Actually, though, this is a minor beating
compared to some you've taken.

28:14.313 --> 28:17.510
On a relative scale,
it merely counts as a dusting up.

28:17.549 --> 28:20.211
I remember doing
my first tour of duty in India.

28:20.252 --> 28:22.982
One of our lads ran afoul of a minor rajah.

28:23.022 --> 28:26.116
You can imagine
the fiendish torture the creature...

28:26.158 --> 28:28.285
Higgins! Look, wait a second.

28:28.327 --> 28:32.093
What makes you think I was beat up?
Anything could have happened.

28:32.131 --> 28:35.931
Besides,
why do you always assume I lost the fight?

28:37.536 --> 28:40.266
- Ha-ha.
- I was just about to depart.

28:40.306 --> 28:44.834
My committee on historical preservation
is viewing a wonderful neoclassical house

28:44.877 --> 28:48.677
- on the other side of the island.
- Congratulations. Have a terrific trip.

28:48.714 --> 28:51.114
I had planned to stay away for several days.

28:51.150 --> 28:55.177
But now, of course,
I could never abandon my duty here.

28:55.220 --> 29:00.055
I can manage. I've got all the instructions
from the hospital emergency room.

29:00.092 --> 29:04.461
I was referring, of course, to the lads. Magnum
is in no condition to take care of them.

29:04.496 --> 29:08.159
Higgins, go. Just go!

29:08.200 --> 29:11.829
I will watch the lads. I'll cube their sirloin.

29:11.870 --> 29:14.737
- I'll even pick up their...
- Magnum.

29:14.773 --> 29:17.435
With that assurance, I'll depart.

29:23.248 --> 29:26.979
By the by...
Even though you're with the police,

29:27.019 --> 29:29.647
you aren't, by any chance,
a client of Magnum's?

29:29.688 --> 29:33.215
No! Absolutely not.

29:36.261 --> 29:37.626
Good.

29:43.502 --> 29:46.471
Tell me, does it still hurt?

29:46.505 --> 29:49.440
Everything hurts.

29:49.475 --> 29:53.241
- Higgins, don't come in here again.
- Thomas, it's us.

29:53.278 --> 29:57.339
- Higgins left already.
- He sure was laughing about something.

29:57.383 --> 30:00.546
Where's that tennis racquet
you never returned?

30:00.586 --> 30:02.645
- Whoa!
- We've got a date with two...

30:02.688 --> 30:05.384
You look awful. Did you get beat up again?

30:05.424 --> 30:10.361
"I bet it was some big dudes.
About 6'6" and maybe 250 pounds.

30:10.396 --> 30:12.694
- Listen...
- I bet they had big guns too, huh?

30:12.731 --> 30:14.824
I bet they're sorry they messed with T. M.

30:14.867 --> 30:18.667
Guys, can we talk about this later?
What have you got for me?

30:18.704 --> 30:22.538
"What have you got for me?"
That's all you and I are good for anymore.

30:22.574 --> 30:27.102
And we're always the ones
sticking our neck out for him and...

30:27.146 --> 30:29.137
Eugh. Doing all the dirty work.

30:29.181 --> 30:32.275
Guys, I'm the guy who got beat up this time.

30:32.317 --> 30:35.309
- That's right.
- I guess you got a point.

30:35.354 --> 30:38.016
We went to the agent
that leased Marcus's car.

30:38.057 --> 30:41.322
We said we wanted to buy it
and he let us take it for a test ride.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.884
Oh-ho-ho!

30:42.928 --> 30:46.056
- Sounds dangerous.
- It is. It's got five on the floor,

30:46.098 --> 30:50.159
- positraction rear end, full race cam...
- Rick!

30:50.202 --> 30:54.730
OK. Here.
We found this in the glove compartment.

30:54.773 --> 30:57.207
Thank you.

30:57.242 --> 31:01.804
It's a parking stub
from Rose's discount warehouse.

31:01.847 --> 31:04.008
Marcus was involved with her. Come on.

31:04.049 --> 31:06.176
Let's go. Let's go.

31:06.218 --> 31:08.379
Up, up. Up.

31:09.254 --> 31:12.849
Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going?

31:14.126 --> 31:17.254
We're gonna go find those girls
who beat him up.

31:17.296 --> 31:18.854
Girls?

31:32.344 --> 31:34.175
Now, Thomas...

31:36.748 --> 31:41.014
Just remember, you won't help anything
by being rough and vindictive.

31:41.053 --> 31:43.681
Don't worry. I'm a professional.

31:47.826 --> 31:49.851
Hi there.

31:59.138 --> 32:02.733
Come here. Come on.

32:04.009 --> 32:08.139
I want some answers, starting with
who is this woman Rose you're working for?

32:08.180 --> 32:10.148
- Magnum.
- What?

32:11.350 --> 32:13.181
- Magnum.
- What?

32:16.722 --> 32:19.919
I hope you're looking for Rose
for a polite reason.

32:19.958 --> 32:23.018
Because you just found him for sure,
sweetheart.

32:25.597 --> 32:27.792
My pal Marcus told me what you were up to.

32:27.833 --> 32:31.735
Now that he's unavailable,
I figured to move in on your action.

32:31.770 --> 32:33.533
- Who's the chick?
- Her?

32:33.572 --> 32:35.767
Nobody. She's just my bimbo.

32:35.807 --> 32:39.299
And he's just my big hunk of man.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.876
So what's this action
you think you can take over?

32:43.916 --> 32:46.646
Marcus was selling hot goods on the street.

32:46.685 --> 32:52.487
Except they weren't so hot because
you laundered them. It's second-hand news.

32:54.026 --> 32:56.824
Your game is lame, lady.

32:58.597 --> 33:01.065
So what makes you think I'd take you in?

33:01.099 --> 33:03.693
I can get my own merchandise.

33:03.735 --> 33:06.795
It's easier to take me in
than fight me for the territory.

33:08.640 --> 33:12.076
What kind of merchandise
are we talking about?

33:12.110 --> 33:14.601
Top-of-the-line stuff. The best.

33:15.547 --> 33:17.378
It better be.

33:17.416 --> 33:21.580
Cos I'd get real upset
if I thought I was being scammed.

33:21.620 --> 33:24.418
- You got that, sweetheart?
- Trust me.

33:26.692 --> 33:28.922
Trust him.

33:31.663 --> 33:36.191
Hey, guys. I got the microwave.
T.C., give me a hand with this speaker.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.072
Thanks.

33:41.106 --> 33:44.598
You've had some cra <i>z</i> y ideas
but this has got to be the cra <i>z</i> iest.

33:44.643 --> 33:48.739
That truck we're using belongs to Ice Pick.
I told him we were moving my aunt.

33:48.780 --> 33:51.044
Guys, this is shrewd detective work.

33:51.083 --> 33:53.176
Every angle has been figured.

33:53.218 --> 33:59.350
Tracy's even getting the serial numbers
so we can prove the goods are ours.

33:59.391 --> 34:02.952
If this is so foolproof,
why aren't we taking stuff from your place?

34:02.995 --> 34:08.364
That's obvious. I promised Rose top quality
and I'm not materialistic.

34:09.434 --> 34:13.029
I have just not spent my money
acquiring things, that's all.

34:13.071 --> 34:15.972
What is Higgie baby gonna say
about all this?

34:16.007 --> 34:19.068
Higgins? If he were here,
he'd be helping us.

34:19.110 --> 34:21.978
He did seem like
an extremely generous man to me.

34:22.914 --> 34:25.313
This chick is a detective?

34:25.350 --> 34:29.547
Ice Pick can get terrific Tank watches.
You can't tell it from the real thing.

34:29.588 --> 34:34.116
So if you're looking for a...
Just a suggestion. I'm just trying to help.

34:35.594 --> 34:38.529
Are we almost finished?
I don't want to be late.

34:38.563 --> 34:41.396
This operation has to be synchroni <i>z</i> ed.

34:41.433 --> 34:44.061
Let me get the stereo stuff from upstairs.

34:44.936 --> 34:48.702
Hey! Come on, guys.
This is gonna be a snap.

34:50.309 --> 34:55.007
<i>I know what you're thinking again,
but this time you're absolutely wrong.</i>

34:55.047 --> 34:58.608
<i>It was one of the sweetest plans ever.
I'd catch Marcus's killer,</i>

34:58.650 --> 35:00.743
<i>Tracy would be out of my life,</i>

35:00.786 --> 35:04.278
<i>and the best part of all
was that we were absolutely safe</i>

35:04.323 --> 35:07.759
<i>because I was relying on human nature</i> -
<i>greed</i>.

35:11.496 --> 35:15.557
- Oh, no.
- Well, what have we got here?

35:17.135 --> 35:20.263
Hi. Ripping us off?

35:20.305 --> 35:22.068
That's right.

35:24.076 --> 35:26.909
OK. Now's the time. Call in the backups.

35:29.281 --> 35:33.775
Go ahead. Call them on your wrist radio
or whatever you use nowadays.

35:34.686 --> 35:38.588
- I can't.
- What? Why?

35:39.591 --> 35:42.116
Because I'm not a detective.

35:42.160 --> 35:45.061
I'm a meter maid.

35:54.404 --> 35:56.395
Come to Rose, sweetheart.

35:57.107 --> 35:58.938
Come on.

36:20.397 --> 36:23.730
Listen, I can explain.
Don't bother.

36:23.767 --> 36:25.632
- Please!
- I won't believe you.

36:25.669 --> 36:29.799
But I want to explain. I need to explain.

36:29.840 --> 36:34.834
Who cares? Tracy, I've been lied to,
conned, humiliated and almost killed.

36:34.878 --> 36:37.142
- Ditto.
- And aloha.

36:37.180 --> 36:40.809
- Next time you need us...
- Just include us out.

36:52.162 --> 36:54.722
I don't want to hear it.

36:55.832 --> 36:59.996
- But...
- Not one single word.

37:02.839 --> 37:05.535
Please. Just listen.

37:06.710 --> 37:08.371
Thomas.

37:09.746 --> 37:11.407
Tho...

37:12.282 --> 37:13.476
Tho...

37:17.587 --> 37:19.111
Look...

37:20.424 --> 37:22.858
My father was a police captain in Cincinnati.

37:22.893 --> 37:25.885
My mother died when I was eight.

37:25.929 --> 37:28.124
I grew up with 27 uncles,

37:28.165 --> 37:31.157
the cops in my dad's precinct.

37:31.201 --> 37:35.069
I was the only girl to go to her graduation
with a full motorcycle escort.

37:35.105 --> 37:39.565
So far I like it better than the story
about being Marcus's fiancée, but not much.

37:39.609 --> 37:44.239
All I ever wanted to be
was a detective like Dad.

37:44.281 --> 37:50.083
So I came out here to make it on my own,
only I can't get on the detective squad.

37:50.120 --> 37:55.251
I can't even get a patrol-person job.
They say it's cos of my bad eyes.

37:55.292 --> 37:58.386
Oh, no. They're just being kind.

37:58.428 --> 38:01.955
But if that's the case,
why don't you move back to Cincinnati?

38:01.999 --> 38:06.095
Maybe the letters are bigger
on the eye charts there.

38:06.136 --> 38:10.835
Don't make fun of me! It was hard enough
to get on the traffic patrol out here.

38:10.874 --> 38:14.776
Which is almost like being a real cop.
Only we don't carry guns.

38:14.811 --> 38:17.837
And on my own time
I respond to homicide calls

38:17.881 --> 38:22.341
because if I solve a big murder case
they'll have to let me be a real cop.

38:22.386 --> 38:25.412
You don't know the marginal cases
I've spent time on,

38:25.455 --> 38:27.355
praying it turned out to be a murder.

38:27.391 --> 38:30.019
- That's the truth.
- Tracy.

38:30.060 --> 38:35.293
You wouldn't know the truth
if it came at you in a head-on collision.

38:35.332 --> 38:37.664
Tom, look.

38:37.701 --> 38:40.568
You've just got to help me.

38:42.039 --> 38:45.998
Because I'm using my vacation time
to crack this case

38:46.043 --> 38:50.309
and I gave myself until I was 30
to become a policewoman,

38:50.347 --> 38:53.783
then I gave myself until I was 31
and my birthday's in two days

38:53.817 --> 38:58.754
and I can't go back a failure
so you're my absolute desperate last chance.

39:00.757 --> 39:02.748
Besides...

39:04.895 --> 39:10.765
Couldn't we just try once more?
Then I promise I won't ask again.

39:10.801 --> 39:14.828
Why? Why would I do
a cra <i>z</i> y thing like that?

39:14.871 --> 39:21.276
Because underneath that tough-guy facade,
you've got a heart of gold.

39:21.311 --> 39:26.078
Because you couldn't say no
to a woman in trouble, no matter what.

39:26.116 --> 39:28.209
- No.
- Because you...

39:29.386 --> 39:32.844
- What did you say?
- I said no.

39:33.657 --> 39:35.716
N- O. No!

39:44.134 --> 39:46.864
And if you think that's gonna work,
you're cra <i>z</i> y.

39:46.903 --> 39:50.134
Now I want you to take that truck back

39:50.173 --> 39:53.040
and then get out of my life, forever.

39:53.977 --> 39:56.946
- Go on!
- Is that your final decision?

39:56.980 --> 39:59.210
- Yes!
- Are you sure?

39:59.249 --> 40:02.047
- Yes!
- Are you absolutely positive?

40:02.085 --> 40:03.609
Yes!

40:24.975 --> 40:28.411
<i>I still know what you're thinking.
I was a little hard on her.</i>

40:28.445 --> 40:30.470
<i>But she deserved it,</i>

40:30.514 --> 40:33.449
<i>even though she called
and promised to pay for the TV.</i>

40:33.483 --> 40:37.214
<i>She said she'd send $20 every month
to Higgins to cover it.</i>

40:37.254 --> 40:41.748
<i>I told her not to bother.
But something else was bothering me.</i>

40:41.791 --> 40:46.228
<i>My little voice. It was telling me
there was one more thing I could try.</i>

41:20.964 --> 41:23.660
S <i>ometimes a single look</i>
<i>says a thousand words</i>.

41:23.700 --> 41:27.261
<i>That morning outside the club,
Marcus and Margaret Chase</i>

41:27.304 --> 41:30.933
<i>exchanged a look that said
a lot more than "Have a nice day."</i>

41:30.974 --> 41:35.035
<i>I thought nothing of it then,
but when you run out of the obvious leads,</i>

41:35.078 --> 41:37.444
<i>your mind has a tendency to create its own</i>.

41:38.548 --> 41:43.281
<i>The inside of the house was cool
and very proper, like Mrs. Chase herself.</i>

41:43.320 --> 41:45.515
<i>Maybe because I'm a private investigator,</i>

41:45.555 --> 41:49.047
<i>I always get uneasy
around people and places like that,</i>

41:49.092 --> 41:52.858
<i>and start looking for anything
that's not quite so perfect.</i>

41:52.896 --> 41:55.296
<i>It seems there's always something</i>.

41:58.969 --> 42:00.732
Oliver?

42:03.673 --> 42:07.507
Oliver, I thought
you weren't due back till... Friday.

42:10.113 --> 42:13.344
- It's not Oliver.
- Well, that's obvious.

42:15.085 --> 42:17.679
And what you have in your hand
is very private.

42:18.722 --> 42:20.553
Murder's never private.

42:20.590 --> 42:22.649
- Give it to me.
- I'll trade you.

42:22.692 --> 42:24.990
For what? I suppose you want money too.

42:25.028 --> 42:27.622
No. Just the truth.

42:29.165 --> 42:31.156
Was someone blackmailing you?

42:31.201 --> 42:32.930
No.

42:32.969 --> 42:35.665
- Marcus was your lover.
- No.

42:35.705 --> 42:38.367
- Someone found out and demanded a payoff?
- No.

42:38.408 --> 42:41.104
And you wouldn't pay so he was killed.

42:41.144 --> 42:44.045
Will you stop it? What do you want?

42:50.220 --> 42:53.519
I want to believe that you're worth dying for.

42:54.391 --> 42:56.086
Marcus did.

43:02.565 --> 43:05.227
In many ways, Marcus was like a little boy.

43:07.137 --> 43:09.332
Wanted to be my hero.

43:10.774 --> 43:14.175
- You were right about the blackmail.
- Rose.

43:15.845 --> 43:17.813
Yeah.

43:17.847 --> 43:24.013
Marcus was working for Rose because
he thought if he had money I'd leave Oliver.

43:25.155 --> 43:29.524
He didn't know that being poor
wasn't what I was afraid of.

43:29.559 --> 43:33.689
I never imagined
that he'd fall in love with me.

43:34.931 --> 43:36.831
Was it your husband?

43:36.866 --> 43:39.198
No. He never knew.

43:40.704 --> 43:42.899
He still doesn't, but I had to end it.

43:44.307 --> 43:47.674
So I told Marcus and he got furious.

43:47.711 --> 43:49.508
We were out on my boat.

43:49.546 --> 43:53.607
I took him there because
I knew how impulsive he could be.

43:53.650 --> 43:58.314
I knew he'd go straight to Rose.
It was the only fight we ever had.

43:58.355 --> 44:01.415
Margaret, who? Was it Rose?

44:02.726 --> 44:05.820
No, it was...

44:05.862 --> 44:08.330
I just never thought he'd do that.

44:10.166 --> 44:13.602
It wasn't murder.

44:13.636 --> 44:15.763
Then what do you call it?

44:15.805 --> 44:18.296
I'd call it quits, sweetheart.

44:22.645 --> 44:24.374
Hi, Rose.

44:24.414 --> 44:26.245
Hi, guys.

44:27.150 --> 44:30.278
- Cash and carry, Mrs. Chase?
- No.

44:32.355 --> 44:34.823
- Come again?
- No.

44:35.859 --> 44:38.851
No more. I am through paying.

44:40.330 --> 44:45.290
- Just leave.
- Maybe you'd like to reconsider.

44:45.335 --> 44:47.769
- I don't think so.
- No?

44:47.804 --> 44:51.069
You want to say goodbye to me? I'll go.

44:51.107 --> 44:54.508
You don't want to pay me no more?
Don't pay.

44:55.712 --> 44:57.805
Come on, ladies.

44:58.915 --> 45:02.578
Except what about Oliver?

45:05.455 --> 45:08.515
Do you want to call him?

45:08.558 --> 45:12.119
Or should we wait until he reads about it
in the papers?

45:12.162 --> 45:15.928
And then there's the trial.

45:15.965 --> 45:18.559
Are you ready for that, Mrs. Chase?

45:20.570 --> 45:23.630
Are you ready to pay the price?

45:26.309 --> 45:29.767
Or do you just want to keep on paying me?

45:55.405 --> 45:58.067
Bet you hated your fathers.

46:21.898 --> 46:23.957
Free <i>z</i> e!

46:26.469 --> 46:28.061
Free <i>z</i> e!

46:31.841 --> 46:33.331
Please?

46:42.418 --> 46:45.182
- Thanks for the game, guys.
- Magnum.

46:46.389 --> 46:47.788
Magnum.

46:47.824 --> 46:52.454
I'm gonna buy you
the tallest, coldest beer you ever had.

46:52.495 --> 46:56.625
Not that I'm trying to encourage
your consumption of alcoholic beverages,

46:56.666 --> 47:00.568
but this is a celebration.

47:01.437 --> 47:03.632
They made you a police person?

47:05.842 --> 47:09.369
They actually... I don't believe it.
The police actually...

47:09.412 --> 47:13.906
Well, it's more like actually sort of.

47:13.950 --> 47:17.943
My application is up for review,
and what I need from you is an affidavit

47:17.987 --> 47:21.980
explaining how I cracked the case,
how invaluable I was.

47:22.025 --> 47:26.086
- Invaluable?
- We can talk about it after the beer.

47:26.129 --> 47:30.930
But just think about it. If I actually
did eventually become a detective,

47:30.967 --> 47:33.800
we could be, like, two pros together.

47:33.836 --> 47:38.739
I mean, maybe even partners.
Isn't that terrific?

47:38.775 --> 47:42.438
Isn't life fabulous? Oh!
