WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:03.602
Don't forget, Greendale.

00:03.636 --> 00:06.005
It's the last day to sign up
for a spring semester elective!

00:06.039 --> 00:07.272
Horseback riding!

00:07.307 --> 00:09.408
Water skiing!
Fencing!

00:09.442 --> 00:12.244
Those are just a few classes
we can afford to offer

00:12.278 --> 00:14.480
if enough people
pay to learn hopscotch.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.448
Oh, they've got a class
on how to write jokes.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.583
Oh, don't take that.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.284
I dropped it
after the lesson on setups.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.820
The Professor is <i>so old...</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:25.991
So many classes.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.326
I don't know what to choose.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.328
I'll give you the same advice
my father gave me

00:29.362 --> 00:30.963
the night I lost my virginity.

00:30.997 --> 00:31.997
"Just pick one.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.465
They all cost the same."

00:33.500 --> 00:34.600
You could always take

00:34.634 --> 00:36.702
"The Actor Inside"
with me and Troy.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.572
How'd you get dragged
into that one?

00:40.607 --> 00:42.808
Our dance teacher encourages
us to take acting classes

00:42.842 --> 00:44.209
to tap into
our emotional cores,

00:44.244 --> 00:46.845
so Troy and I both decided
to take it together.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.380
Hmm. Foosball was full?

00:48.415 --> 00:49.581
I'm on the wait list.

00:49.616 --> 00:50.749
Don't give up.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.351
I was on the wait list
for this media class

00:52.385 --> 00:54.219
for a year and a half
and I finally got in.

00:54.254 --> 00:55.587
<i>"Who Indeed:</i>
<i>A Critical Analysis</i>

00:55.622 --> 00:57.222
<i>of Television's</i>
Who's the Boss?"

00:57.257 --> 00:58.757
The professor of this class
is the author of this book.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.426
- We got him?
- I know.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.194
So what are you taking, Jeff?

01:02.228 --> 01:03.429
Well, while you knuckleheads

01:03.463 --> 01:04.596
are expanding
your minds and souls,

01:04.631 --> 01:05.964
I'll be expanding my liver

01:05.999 --> 01:07.733
in "Italian Wine Tasting."

01:07.767 --> 01:08.867
Oh! <i>Molto bene!</i>

01:08.902 --> 01:10.102
I'm taking that one, too.

01:10.136 --> 01:13.238
Hmm. How do you say
"ha ha" in Italian?

01:13.273 --> 01:14.940
I'll look it up.

01:14.974 --> 01:16.775
Come on, Jeff, it'll be fun.
I can give you pointers.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.844
Pierce, I was a lawyer
at a top-tier law firm.

01:18.878 --> 01:20.979
When I wasn't shielding
the wealthy from justice,

01:21.014 --> 01:22.448
I was drinking
their finest wines.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.049
I assume you have
your own wine cellar.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.117
Pierce does.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.852
And it's, "ha ha!"

01:26.886 --> 01:28.253
Anyone can have a cellar.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.621
It's what's in it that counts.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.091
Pierce's has a special gym
with swings and saddles.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.293
Uh, we don't... we don't
discuss the special gym.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.929
Uh, attention, please.

01:36.963 --> 01:39.832
All elective forms must be in

01:39.866 --> 01:41.333
by the end of the day.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.335
Oh, nice job, Manuel.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.804
And good news.
There's still plenty of room

01:45.839 --> 01:47.639
in my P.A. Announcements class.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.508
Just ten bucks an hour.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.679
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

01:53.713 --> 01:57.082

02:19.272 --> 02:20.806
You're taking this, too?

02:20.840 --> 02:21.840
Hell, yeah.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.209
Got drunk ladies,
fancy bathrooms,

02:24.244 --> 02:27.746
and a room full of free coats.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.014
Sorry I'm late, man.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.048
I brought you a present.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.416
Oh.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.585
From before
your chin dimple filled in.

02:33.620 --> 02:37.756
Uh, excuse me.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.158
- So sorry.
- Hmm!

02:39.192 --> 02:41.226
Wow.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.996
Who is the dumpling
with the nice Asian pair?

02:44.030 --> 02:46.398
That's the first time
sexism has made me hungry,

02:46.432 --> 02:48.033
but she is something.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.302
I fear I may have
to let her see me nude.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.004
I might have to take
a shot myself.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.406
What's so funny?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.675
Well, why would a woman
want a Plymouth on cinder blocks

02:56.709 --> 02:58.777
when she could have
a Testarossa, 500 horsepower

02:58.811 --> 03:00.112
with a six-speed stick?

03:00.146 --> 03:02.681
'Cause my stick is ribbed
for her pleasure.

03:02.715 --> 03:03.815
I think those are wrinkles.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.319
Let that breathe.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.192
Lingering scent, full body,

03:13.226 --> 03:14.493
perfect nose.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.761
Very nice wine.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.262
I was talking about you.

03:17.297 --> 03:19.064
Jeff Winger.

03:19.098 --> 03:20.566
Wu Mei Hong Long.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.834
Oh, what a lovely name
for a lovely...

03:22.869 --> 03:24.670
Uh, not interested.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.638
Please take weird haircut,

03:26.673 --> 03:28.307
stupid grin,

03:28.341 --> 03:30.776
and go sniff another dog's ass.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.681
Hmm hmm, the red dragon
ordered a number 37

03:35.715 --> 03:38.083
with a side
of pork-fried snap.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.223
When you get up close,
she's very homely.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.293
This is gonna be fun.

03:48.328 --> 03:49.928
I can't wait
till we choose stage names.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.330
Which do you think is better?

03:51.364 --> 03:54.166
Trevor St. McGoodbody
or David?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.068
I don't think you have
to worry about stuff like that.

03:56.102 --> 03:57.903
This class is
more about introspection.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.872
Drag.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.376
Less of a drag.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.545
Quiet!

04:08.114 --> 04:09.648
Form a trust circle around me

04:09.682 --> 04:10.916
and sit on the floor.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.217
A trust circle?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.619
It's just a circle.

04:13.653 --> 04:14.720
It's a circle.
Sit down.

04:17.824 --> 04:21.360
Acting is revealing,
expression.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.962
When we release pain,

04:23.997 --> 04:26.698
we become visible
to each other,

04:26.733 --> 04:29.468
and that is an actor's job.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.203
That and, you know,

04:31.237 --> 04:33.071
pretending to be other people.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.273
Let's start with you.

04:34.307 --> 04:37.909
Access and share with us

04:37.944 --> 04:40.345
a profoundly deep
and painful memory.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.782
I'm on the playground.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.351
Stop taunting me!

04:48.187 --> 04:49.888
I just want to go
on the swings!

04:49.922 --> 04:51.456
Good.

04:51.491 --> 04:54.660
Early childhood
is a treasure trove of pain.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.094
That happened this morning.

04:59.899 --> 05:01.066
You're up.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.668
Me? Um...

05:02.702 --> 05:04.102
I don't...
I don't think, uh...

05:04.137 --> 05:05.604
I don't want you to think.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.638
Feel!

05:06.673 --> 05:08.106
Go back.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.475
Dig in. Emotilize.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.045
Something hurt you.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.246
Um...

05:14.280 --> 05:16.748
I was captain
of my high school football team.

05:18.951 --> 05:24.022
It was very hard being popular.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.525
What a loser.

05:26.559 --> 05:27.826
Okay, great.
Next person.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.095
I've always felt
somehow ignored,

05:30.129 --> 05:32.464
almost invisible.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.100
Like every time I go to say
something, somebody just...

05:35.134 --> 05:36.568
My uncle put his finger
in my no-no!

05:44.277 --> 05:47.112
This... this
is where acting begins.

05:54.954 --> 05:58.824
Welcome to "A Critical
Analysis of <i>Who's the Boss?"</i>

05:58.858 --> 06:01.360
I am Professor Peter Sheffield,

06:01.394 --> 06:06.765
and I'd like to begin
with a simple question...

06:06.799 --> 06:08.367
Who was the boss?

06:12.872 --> 06:13.905
Yes.

06:13.940 --> 06:14.906
Angela.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.145
Oh, well!
Class dismissed!

06:21.914 --> 06:23.749
No, calm down.
Calm down.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.385
I'm sorry, um...

06:26.419 --> 06:28.253
- Mister...?
- Abed.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.723
The answer is not
quite that simple, Mr. Abed.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.225
Few are.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.929
Now, if everyone
could please turn to page 12

06:37.964 --> 06:38.964
in my book...

06:38.998 --> 06:40.432
Loser!

06:40.466 --> 06:42.601
You really have to finish
that whole book by tomorrow?

06:42.635 --> 06:44.136
Yeah, but it's a page-turner.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.871
I'm on the chapter where he
traces Tony Micelli's genealogy

06:45.905 --> 06:47.406
all the way back to Caesar.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.307
Well, it's gotta be better
than wine tasting with Pierce.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.909
He refused to drink Pinot Noir

06:50.943 --> 06:52.377
because he thought it was French
for "black penis."

06:52.412 --> 06:54.579
And he's late. Again.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.448
It's not your fault.

06:56.482 --> 06:57.816
It's not your fault.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.120
Oh, I'm sure he'll be here.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.256
He wouldn't miss a chance to pop
in and say something offensive.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.323
One day soon, that man's gonna

07:05.358 --> 07:06.658
run out of ways
to shock people.

07:06.692 --> 07:07.726
Everybody,

07:07.760 --> 07:09.494
this is Wu Mei,

07:09.529 --> 07:11.596
and we're getting married!

07:12.965 --> 07:14.733
But it's not gonna be today.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.408
So, uh, you're getting married

07:23.443 --> 07:25.010
to that beautiful young thing?

07:25.044 --> 07:27.479
Well, uh, stranger things
have happened.

07:27.513 --> 07:28.713
No.
No, they haven't.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.649
You said you guys just met?

07:30.683 --> 07:32.017
Yesterday,
after wine tasting class.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.352
I mentioned
that her breasts were larger

07:34.387 --> 07:35.687
than most Asian women,

07:35.721 --> 07:38.023
and, uh,
we just got to talking.

07:38.057 --> 07:40.692
Turns out Pierce has been
to China many times.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.060
It's the only place
to get fireworks

07:42.094 --> 07:43.128
that are too dangerous
for Mexico.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.230
No. I go
to visit my factory.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.899
Hawthorne Wipes are the number
one moist towelette in Asia.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.235
Anyway, after a few minutes,
we both just knew

07:50.269 --> 07:52.304
we were meant to be
together forever.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.606
Or at least
until she gets heavy.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.876
And, uh, now we must leave you.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.878
Many plans to make.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.148
Yes, yes, big plans.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.684
Well, what are we gonna do?

08:05.718 --> 08:06.985
Plan an engagement party?

08:07.019 --> 08:08.520
Are you out of your mind?!
This is a scam.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.590
She's after him for his money
or a green card or something!

08:11.624 --> 08:13.058
They seem
to really like each other.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.826
Yeah, and Pierce married
three of his wives

08:14.861 --> 08:16.294
after knowing them
less than a month.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.395
Maybe he's just a romantic.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.164
Not that you
would understand romance.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.966
Don't preach to me
about romance, Annie.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.102
I had a three-way
in a hot air balloon.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.871
Guess I'll do it myself.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.173
- Want to go?
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.207 --> 08:31.042
Boy, he seems really worked up.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.278
Hey, don't take on his pain.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.145
Tend your own garden.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.085
I'll see you in class.

08:43.688 --> 08:44.890
What's going on?

08:44.924 --> 08:47.425
Oh, um, I didn't have
a painful experience

08:47.460 --> 08:49.461
to share in acting class,
so I made up this story

08:49.495 --> 08:51.296
about my uncle trying
to touch my butt.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.731
Britta's attracted
to men in pain.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.332
It helps her pretend
to be mentally healthy.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.367
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:55.401 --> 08:56.735
I hadn't noticed.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.104
Troy? Nothing good
can come of this.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.805
Yeah.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.474
I'll have to think really hard

09:02.508 --> 09:04.242
about how to defuse
the situation.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.777
No, uncle Lucius!

09:05.811 --> 09:08.313
I don't want to play
in the laundry room!

09:08.347 --> 09:10.215
My emotions!

09:10.249 --> 09:12.384
My emotions!

09:17.723 --> 09:19.691
Actors dismissed.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.093
Uh, for homework,

09:22.128 --> 09:25.397
drink a glass of cognac
in a bathtub.

09:25.431 --> 09:30.101
Troy, I feel like I'm seeing
a whole different side of you.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.037
There's just so much darkness.

09:33.172 --> 09:35.774
And my soul is darkening,

09:35.808 --> 09:40.378
and my heart is mad
at my kidneys, and...

09:40.413 --> 09:42.013
My mouth...Mm!

09:44.750 --> 09:47.285
See you tomorrow?

09:52.625 --> 09:54.225
Uh, hello.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.527
Oh, hi.
I'm glad you could come.

09:55.561 --> 09:56.962
Please sit.

09:56.996 --> 10:00.999
I felt like we got off
on the wrong foot yesterday,

10:01.033 --> 10:04.069
and I wanted to offer you
my, uh, other foot.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.806
First, let me just say how happy
I am for you both.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.074
Your parents
must be so excited.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.175
Are they coming to the wedding?

10:10.209 --> 10:12.077
Oh, they would not miss it.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.547
My mother will make
the customary shark's fin soup,

10:15.581 --> 10:17.015
and my father will get drunk

10:17.049 --> 10:19.584
and make bad impression
of Borat.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.419
Oh, so your parents don't mind

10:21.454 --> 10:23.355
having a son-in-law
roughly their age?

10:23.389 --> 10:27.459
No. Pierce
is a beautiful, wise man,

10:27.493 --> 10:29.628
very gentle soul.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.364
Uh, let me tell you
that I am a lawyer,

10:32.398 --> 10:34.132
so if you need any help at all

10:34.166 --> 10:36.935
navigating the whole green card
immigration hassle.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.070
I am dual citizen already.

10:39.105 --> 10:42.007
Oh. Well, if you'd like me to
look at the prenup...

10:42.041 --> 10:43.875
I assume you have one.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.878
Yes, but my father's lawyers
will take care of this.

10:46.912 --> 10:50.548
After all, we must protect
our family fortune.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.384
Hmm.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.585
Now I'm stumped.

10:53.619 --> 10:54.586
Excuse me?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.054
Uh, it was...

10:56.088 --> 10:58.456
That means it was very nice
talking to you.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.125
Oh, okay, if you say so.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.860
- Okay.
- Okay, good-bye.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.398
Why were you grilling her?

11:06.432 --> 11:09.701
Listen, I'm gonna bust
into her apartment.

11:09.735 --> 11:11.036
Do you have
any grappling hooks.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.771
Maybe Pierce finally found
his soul mate.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.006
How can you say those things
without any trace of irony?

11:15.041 --> 11:17.108
That's why they call me
irony-free Annie.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.944
Mm, trust me,
that's not what they call you.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.586
Yes?

11:28.621 --> 11:31.222
Oh. Mr. Abed.
What can I do for you?

11:31.257 --> 11:32.657
I finished your book,
Professor,

11:32.692 --> 11:34.626
and I've been watching episodes
of <i>Who's the Boss?</i>

11:34.660 --> 11:36.861
And I think there's something
that you might have overlooked.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.296
Mr. Abed,
will you look at my wall?

11:38.330 --> 11:41.032
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you see?

11:41.067 --> 11:42.267
- Photographs.
- Of what?

11:42.301 --> 11:43.435
- You.
- With whom?

11:43.469 --> 11:44.803
Tony Danza, Judith Light,
Alyssa Milano,

11:44.837 --> 11:46.638
<i>Who's the Boss?</i>
Season three caterer,

11:46.672 --> 11:48.206
Gordon "Giddy-up" Galligan.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.242
I have studied this show,
mister Abed.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.744
I am not a fan,

11:52.778 --> 11:54.646
I am not a groupie,

11:54.680 --> 11:57.082
I am an academic.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.818
When I ask the question,
"Who's the boss?"

11:59.852 --> 12:01.453
It is a rhetorical question.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.689
When I ask the question beyond
the question, "What is a boss?"

12:04.724 --> 12:07.225
I really think it's Angela,
because if it's a boss...

12:08.761 --> 12:09.894
Enough!

12:09.929 --> 12:10.962
I would like you to leave
my room.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.397
My mind is open, Professor.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.865
It's as open as the door
to Mona's bedroom.

12:13.899 --> 12:17.202
- It's a shame yours isn't.
- I beg your pardon?

12:17.236 --> 12:20.972
You know?
I just got a wonderful idea.

12:21.006 --> 12:24.209
Why don't you teach
the next class?

12:24.243 --> 12:28.079
That way you can share your
open mind with everybody.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.514
Cool.
Cool cool cool.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.249
Pchew.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.619
I couldn't be more touched

12:34.653 --> 12:36.654
that you all threw us
an engagement party.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.089
You said if we didn't,
you'd slash our tires.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.558
She is funny.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.626
Like Oprah.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.261
Oprah's not a comedienne.

12:43.295 --> 12:47.432
No, you are funny,
and you are like Oprah.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.167
Yeah.
What?

12:49.201 --> 12:50.635
Thank you.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.605
Pierce, I'd like to offer
my sincere congratulations.

12:53.639 --> 12:55.106
It's hard enough to find people

12:55.141 --> 12:56.574
you can stand in this life,

12:56.609 --> 12:58.643
let alone someone
who's willing to stomach

12:58.677 --> 13:00.745
your imminent dementia
and present incontinence.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.913
Thank you, Jeff.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.882
I just hope she can satisfy me.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.885
I'm like an insatiable baboon
in the bedroom.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.119
Don't sell yourself short.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.354
You're a baboon everywhere.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.458
Seems like just yesterday

13:13.492 --> 13:15.326
me and Abed
dined and ditched here.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.167
Here, hold this.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.102
Ugh, what is this?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.504
I always carry some spare apps
in case the wait staff's racist.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.006
Where's a napkin?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.174
Uh, here you go.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.242
Oh, thanks.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.544
Check that out.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.380
Hats off to Pierce
and the hot red dragon.

13:35.414 --> 13:36.548
Why do you keep
calling her that?

13:36.582 --> 13:38.383
"Hong Long" means red dragon.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.684
But that's her middle name.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.886
In China, they
put the last name first.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.121
I mean,
they're nuts over there.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.423
Hm-hmm.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.863
Thank you all for coming.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.298
I know it seems fast,

13:53.332 --> 13:55.600
but when you find the right
person, you just know it.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.069
I know that because I've found
the right person seven times.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.105
So the drinks are on me,
but stick to the crappy stuff.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.107
I don't want to get corn-holed
on the bar tab.

14:03.142 --> 14:06.144
Pierce, you can't just throw
around a term like that.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.112
Corn-hole.

14:08.147 --> 14:11.149
Corn-hole, corn-hole!

14:11.183 --> 14:14.219
Pierce!
Troy was molested!

14:14.253 --> 14:15.253
Cool.

14:17.823 --> 14:20.859
Troy, we didn't know.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.560
Troy, do you need me
to recommend a support group?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.229
Hey, he's not a victim.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.730
You're a survivor.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.639
Yeah, about that...

14:34.673 --> 14:37.709
I wasn't so much "molested"

14:37.743 --> 14:40.578
as much as I "made it up."

14:40.613 --> 14:42.647
What?

14:42.681 --> 14:45.183
We're gonna laugh so hard
about this later.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.918
I'd like to propose a toast.

14:46.952 --> 14:51.956
Wu Mei Hong Long, better known
as Mei Hong Long Wu,

14:51.991 --> 14:55.093
is not only
not a Greendale student,

14:55.127 --> 14:57.328
she works for Red Dragon Wwipes,

14:57.363 --> 15:00.265
the number two wipe in Asia,

15:00.299 --> 15:04.035
currently attempting
a takeover of Hawthorne Wipes.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.803
So please, raise your glasses

15:05.838 --> 15:09.240
to saving Pierce from
the clutches of a corporate spy,

15:09.275 --> 15:11.776
and to me for being
attractive enough

15:11.810 --> 15:15.046
to get a girl like her
under normal circumstances.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.650
Very impressive, Veronica Mars.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.084
You learned how to use Google.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.320
And you learned to fight
your physical desire for me.

15:22.354 --> 15:23.588
Oh, stick it.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.690
You suck.

15:26.992 --> 15:30.194
Wait, wait, wait.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.498
Record scratch app.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:43.876 --> 15:45.276
Where'd everybody go?

15:45.311 --> 15:47.712
Most people went home.

15:47.746 --> 15:49.180
The rest went with Chang
to your place

15:49.214 --> 15:50.348
to have a ketchup fight.

15:50.382 --> 15:51.983
Oh, jeez, I better
get back there

15:52.017 --> 15:53.718
before he starts
playing monkey drop.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.020
Don't ask.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.522
Oh, uh, do you want to come?

15:57.556 --> 16:00.258
Why would I want to go
anywhere with Judas Winger?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.126
You're mad at me?
You should be thanking me.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.729
For what?
Ruining my relationship?

16:04.763 --> 16:06.097
What relationship?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.766
You just met the woman,
and the entire thing was a lie.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.835
She was just using you to get
your company in China.

16:10.869 --> 16:13.438
And I was just using her to
get her company in the sack.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.473
People use each other Jeff.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.241
It doesn't mean that
there aren't good feelings

16:17.276 --> 16:18.576
that go along with it.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.211
I liked her.

16:20.245 --> 16:23.381
She was busty.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.816
I thought we had something.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.751
I was trying to help you.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.119
I think what
you were trying to do

16:28.153 --> 16:30.388
is prove that no woman
could want me.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.767
Oh, you're here.

16:42.801 --> 16:45.503
Look, Britta, I'm really sorry.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.372
Troy, kissing you
was a mistake.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.673
It will never happen again.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.442
Good.

16:51.477 --> 16:53.878
Before my ex-boyfriend Pablo
was arrested

16:53.912 --> 16:55.279
for forging church relics,

16:55.314 --> 16:57.081
he accused me
of only being attracted

16:57.116 --> 16:58.783
to a certain kind of guy.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.019
It was hard
to understand him, though.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.954
He was pretty huffed up
on paint thinners.

17:02.988 --> 17:06.523
Well, maybe someday, you'll
fall for someone who's healthy.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.126
Someone who,

17:08.160 --> 17:10.361
other than his irrational fear
of automatic toilets,

17:10.396 --> 17:12.930
is normal.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.101
Who would like to begin today?

17:17.136 --> 17:18.770
I would.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.606
With a confession.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.342
My uncle never stuck
his finger in my plop-plop.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.310
I know.
I'm bummed about it, too.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.746
I'm sorry.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.715
I...want to be interesting.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.818
I want to fit in with you guys.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.921
I want to be able
to be an actor.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.500
The pain
of not having enough pain

17:49.535 --> 17:51.702
is still pain, young man.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.973
That may seem
like an easy resolution, but...

17:56.008 --> 17:58.309
We're not writers.

17:58.343 --> 17:59.777
We're actors.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.182
Story doesn't matter here.

18:07.086 --> 18:12.423
All that matters is our time

18:12.458 --> 18:15.393
in the spotlight.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.728
And so,
by all known definitions

18:17.763 --> 18:20.064
of the word "boss," I.E.,
one with authority over another,

18:20.099 --> 18:21.999
in 9 of 11 known
possible fields

18:22.034 --> 18:25.269
in which one might teach,
employ, guide,

18:25.304 --> 18:27.105
oversee, and/or
otherwise hold dominion,

18:27.139 --> 18:28.940
the empirically provable answer

18:28.974 --> 18:32.743
to the question "who's the boss?" is...

18:35.047 --> 18:37.348
Angela Bauer.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.026
Class dismissed.

18:57.836 --> 19:01.072
Class dismissed!

19:12.184 --> 19:14.719
There's a path you take
and a path untaken.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.890
The choice is up to you,
my friend.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.818
I wonder why Jeff and Abed
didn't show?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.154
Well, I don't know about Abed,

19:50.189 --> 19:52.957
but I'm sure Jeff just
found another life to destroy.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.193
Are you still thinking
about studying acting?

19:55.227 --> 19:56.961
I'm auditioning
for Professor Garrity's

19:56.995 --> 19:59.363
all-black production
of <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

19:59.398 --> 20:01.332
It's called <i>Fiddla Please.</i>

20:02.601 --> 20:03.801
What's she doing here?

20:03.835 --> 20:05.236
I asked her to come.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.372
I was thinking, maybe you two
were meant to be together.

20:08.407 --> 20:11.008
You're both rude, you're
both deceitful and racist,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.611
and you both come
from moist wipe dynasties.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.246
I think having
that much in common

20:15.280 --> 20:17.215
justifies
at least one real date.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.784
I guess we could
go out to one dinner.

20:19.818 --> 20:21.719
- You're paying.
- You're dressing slutty.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.087
Fine.

20:23.121 --> 20:24.555
How about Mexican?

20:24.590 --> 20:25.923
How about Thai?

20:25.958 --> 20:27.825
They're like Chinese Mexicans.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.460
- Hmm, so true.
- Mmm.
