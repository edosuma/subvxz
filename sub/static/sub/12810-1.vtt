WEBVTT

00:26.127 --> 00:29.330
- [Man in grey] Seems like
we always get our man.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.365
- [Man in white] Yep, it's
time to flip that coin.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.734
- You're not serious.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.069
- Serious as ever.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.772
Heads.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.242
Justice will be served.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.080
(gunshot)

00:49.983 --> 00:51.852
- It was a crazy turn of events

00:51.885 --> 00:53.921
that started your
great-grandfather down

00:53.954 --> 00:56.657
the road of becoming a
world-famous gunfighter.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.194
- Was it a pack of wild Indians?

01:00.228 --> 01:02.730
Was it a big army?

01:02.763 --> 01:04.397
- In time, son, you'll
learn it's not always

01:04.432 --> 01:06.634
an army you're fighting
outside in the world,

01:06.667 --> 01:09.002
but many times, it's an
army inside yourself.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.139
- What do you mean, papa?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.072
(thunder)

01:12.106 --> 01:13.073
- It looks like rain.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.042
Let's go over to the lake shed.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.076
I'm gonna tell you a story.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.311
- I love stories.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.079
- Well, you're
gonna love this one.

01:19.113 --> 01:22.683
It takes place a long, long
time ago in the Wild West.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.423
- [Voiceover] I'm
sorry, sorry, Marcus!

01:29.457 --> 01:30.891
Another chance!

01:30.924 --> 01:32.660
Marcus, please, please, Marcus!

01:38.031 --> 01:40.201
(gunshot)

01:41.302 --> 01:43.003
- [Marcus] This here fella,

01:43.036 --> 01:44.805
doesn't feel the need
to pay his debts.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.907
- A man always pays his debts.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.143
You know, there's that old
fella from ancient Greece,

01:49.177 --> 01:50.911
Socrates.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.045
He said that.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.283
- My brother, he's
always reading

01:55.316 --> 01:58.018
and what you might
call a worldly,

01:58.051 --> 02:00.921
a learned man.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.257
One thing I know, it's
the mark of a barbarian

02:03.291 --> 02:06.194
to shoot a man, unarmed,
while he's on the ground.

02:07.295 --> 02:12.032
And I, we, are not barbarians.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.067
- True.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.345
- Ten paces, agreed?

02:24.378 --> 02:27.114
Now, I ain't into
all that philosophy,

02:27.147 --> 02:30.684
I don't know, I guess I'm a
meat and potatoes kind of guy.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.987
- Now, I'm a meat and
potatoes man, myself, brother.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.057
What do you say,
once we're done here,

02:37.090 --> 02:40.160
we go to Boo's Saloon
and grab us some meat.

02:40.194 --> 02:43.931
Maybe, take that little
Mexican girl for a spell.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.969
- Damn, that Mexican girl
is worth every damn peso.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.371
- Yeah, bought
think to the future.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.039
(gunshots)

02:57.378 --> 02:59.747
- That was a miracle.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.916
- That was rude.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.362
(gunshot)

03:20.368 --> 03:22.936
(frontier music)

03:24.938 --> 03:26.607
- What are you thinking about?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.881
Where do you go?

03:38.118 --> 03:39.953
You know, I've
been thinking that

03:39.987 --> 03:41.955
maybe we can go
somewhere, together.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.224
Maybe California?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.094
Nothing ever happens here.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.096
- [Bill] That's exactly
why I like this town.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.235
- Just think about it, Bill.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.272
- [Bill] OK.

04:02.343 --> 04:06.246
- You know, brother,
this town is certainly

04:06.280 --> 04:08.682
not known for its poker players.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.349
- This is not a
well-prepared steak!

04:43.183 --> 04:46.086
Hey, whoa, whoa, wait
a minute, brother.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.855
We got some cards to play.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.359
- You're right, you're right.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.968
Old man's on his toes.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.038
- [Bill] Are you
gonna get dressed?

05:05.072 --> 05:06.707
- Do you really want me to?

05:07.875 --> 05:08.742
- No.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.012
- Bill! Bill!

05:12.045 --> 05:13.280
- Cutty, how many
times I gotta tell you

05:13.313 --> 05:15.215
not to come crashing
in here like a mad man?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.250
- I'm sorry, sir, I
didn't mean no disrespect.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.087
Miss Malena.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.022
- Hey Cutty.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.190
- Cutty, Cutty!

05:24.392 --> 05:26.059
What is it?

05:26.093 --> 05:28.161
- Sir, the Robby brother,
they're in the saloon.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.063
They're asking for Miss Malena.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.700
- Another hand?

05:32.733 --> 05:33.767
- Yeah.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.110
- OK, I will see your four.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.917
- Hm, yeah?

05:51.385 --> 05:54.388
Well, I'm all in.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.391
Grab your cajones, boys.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.030
- Robby, brothers, huh?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.233
(ominous music)

06:17.878 --> 06:18.979
Marcus.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.985
- What took you so long?

06:38.799 --> 06:42.235
- Way I see it, you two
split about three days ago.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.772
Found your horse though.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.240
- Yeah, she was lame, I had
to put a bullet in her brain.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.013
- Real slow like.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.167
- How's your wife?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.078
- Get off!

07:25.112 --> 07:26.279
(gunshot)

07:31.118 --> 07:33.086
- Yes, sir, they've
been drinking.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.087
People are scared.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.255
- I don't need the details.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.924
- [Cutty] Shouldn't
we call the militia?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.926
- No, we do not need
to call the militia.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.928
I want you to stay here.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.262
- You don't want me
to come with you?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.631
- [Bill] Malena.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.034
Keep your gun, come on.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.302
Cutty!

07:51.672 --> 07:55.008
- Well, now this young fella,
Cutty, he was a bit young,

07:55.042 --> 07:58.646
but, sometimes, young people
can do extraordinary things.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.347
- What is "extraordinary"?

08:00.380 --> 08:03.016
- Well, it's beyond what
you think you can do.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.686
Better yet, what most
people think you can do.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.888
- I think I wanna
be extraordinary.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.792
- You already are, young
man, you already are.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.227
- So, what happens next?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.566
- Well, the Robby brothers...

08:20.834 --> 08:22.002
- Four of a kind.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.740
- Hey, hey, not so
fast, Mr. Philosophy.

08:32.011 --> 08:32.946
You?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.248
Thought so.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.254
Royal flush, let me see that!

08:51.098 --> 08:52.065
- [Kid] Sheriff!

08:52.099 --> 08:53.266
Sheriff!

08:54.301 --> 08:55.402
- Get inside, go, go!

08:55.435 --> 08:56.336
(gunshots)

08:56.369 --> 08:57.805
Go, get inside!

09:08.916 --> 09:10.684
- Marcus and Raymond Robby!

09:10.718 --> 09:12.352
This is Sheriff Bill Hickock.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.054
Throw down your
guns and come out.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.023
- Hickock?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.257
- Springfield.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.703
- Bill, I'm scared,
I don't wanna die.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.204
- Hey, hey, hey, listen to me,

09:31.238 --> 09:32.372
you are not gonna die,

09:32.405 --> 09:33.974
you just do exactly
what I tell you to,

09:34.007 --> 09:34.975
you understand me?

09:35.008 --> 09:36.243
Do you understand?

09:38.746 --> 09:40.080
Marcus, Raymond?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.982
(gunshots)

10:16.116 --> 10:17.651
- Sheriff!

10:17.685 --> 10:19.319
There's a lotta people in here,

10:19.352 --> 10:21.021
you don't wanna get them killed.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
- Hey Sheriff!

10:27.160 --> 10:29.129
How's that pretty wife of yours?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.832
Oh, I forgot, she's dead.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.703
- OK.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.274
Give me to the count of
ten, the count of 10,

10:41.308 --> 10:42.442
then you cover me.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.044
- Yes, yes, sir.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.003
- I'm out, Ray!

11:15.743 --> 11:16.877
Ray!

11:21.114 --> 11:22.249
- Marcus!

11:30.891 --> 11:32.259
Don't do it.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.035
Drop it.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.250
Cutty?

11:59.987 --> 12:02.990
Escort Marcus Robby to jail.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.933
Are you all right, Terius?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.001
- Yeah.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.908
- [Bill] You wanted to see me?

12:26.146 --> 12:29.216
- So how did these outlaws
even get into my town?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.084
- Apparently they'd
been here before.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.820
Before you took me on.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.287
They asked for Malena by name.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.957
- You mean, before I picked
you up out of the gutter

12:36.990 --> 12:38.859
and gave you
something to keep on.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.028
- Yeah.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.864
- Did I invite you to eat?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.070
Those boys robbed
the Abeline train,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.239
and killed ten contract workers.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.273
I'm thinking they're the ones

12:53.306 --> 12:56.109
that were choking our supplies.

12:56.143 --> 13:00.113
What I need to know is
can you deal with this?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.182
- Yeah, I can deal with it.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.086
- Rebecca!

13:06.119 --> 13:07.287
My coffee's empty.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.092
You do that again, I'll put
your big head in a vice.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.761
- [Rebecca] I'm sorry, sir.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.096
- It's really hard to
find good help nowadays.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.831
These people, they
come from the East,

13:17.865 --> 13:20.033
they're idiots, just idiots.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.370
Present company excluded.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.872
You know it's bad
enough we have to beg

13:24.905 --> 13:27.007
the government to
get these provisions.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.109
Now it's gotta get
stolen, and people

13:29.142 --> 13:31.979
gotta ration all their
food and their supplies.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.813
It's a terrible situation.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.382
- Yeah, I can see that.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.120
Well, at least now
the provisions are
gonna get through.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.721
- Keep the peace, Sheriff.

13:41.754 --> 13:42.956
Go away.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.358
- Sir, we're dangerously
low on bullets.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.161
- I think that's just
a momentary situation

13:48.195 --> 13:50.063
in a nowhere town.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.165
Have a good day.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.904
Oh, Sheriff.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.738
What are you gonna do
about Marcus Robby?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.975
- I called the Marshal
out of Abeline,

14:02.009 --> 14:03.043
he's about three
or four days out,

14:03.076 --> 14:05.045
he's gonna put him in
front of Judge Freeman.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.346
- Judge Freeman?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.815
Now there's a
merciless human being.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.151
He'll have him
hanged in 15 minutes.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.320
Splendid.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.888
- [Bill] Is that all?

14:14.922 --> 14:16.023
- Be gone.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.043
- What are you looking at?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.878
- A dead man.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.182
- Not from this
side of the bars.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.051
Freeman's gonna ring your neck.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.089
- Bill Hickok, that name,

14:49.122 --> 14:51.691
I know that name from somewhere.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.261
That might be the
same Bill Hickok

14:54.294 --> 14:58.631
that murdered his partner,
down in Springfield, hm?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.868
- Bill's a good man.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.971
- He looks different
than I remember.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.638
You know what I mean?

15:06.906 --> 15:11.911
You know, word is,

15:11.945 --> 15:15.248
he fell off the wagon
and into a bottle.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.388
I like to think I had
something to do with that.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.156
- He still put you
down, didn't he?

15:25.092 --> 15:27.627
- A broken watch is
right twice a day.

15:27.660 --> 15:31.231
He limped into this dying town,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.967
like the broken dog that he is.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.668
- Watch what you say.

15:37.204 --> 15:41.008
- He murdered that
man in cold blood.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.845
- I said, watch what you say!

15:48.015 --> 15:52.752
- Now, you be a good
boy, and open this gate.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.088
Do you hear me?

15:55.122 --> 15:56.823
Slow.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.780
- See you, Bill.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.815
- That's it, Bill, we
need those supplies.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.017
- I know, I know.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.658
- [Cutty] Don't...

16:31.691 --> 16:33.226
- Shhhh.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.031
- [Cutty] Please, don't.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.170
- Bill, I just
thought you might...

16:43.203 --> 16:44.671
(gunshot)

16:45.705 --> 16:46.806
- Get inside!

16:46.839 --> 16:47.740
Go!

16:58.851 --> 16:59.852
- Bill!

16:59.886 --> 17:00.887
Bill, Marcus escaped!

17:00.920 --> 17:01.654
- He went that way.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.222
- You all right?

17:02.255 --> 17:03.556
- Yes.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.646
- What do you think
he's gonna do?

17:29.048 --> 17:29.949
Bill?

17:41.961 --> 17:43.062
- What's that, Grandpa?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.697
- Oh, it's just a
pill for my heart.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.065
Keep it strong.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.067
- [Kid] Do I need a pill for
my heart to keep it strong?

17:48.101 --> 17:51.204
- No, your heart's
strong as can be, son.

17:51.238 --> 17:54.073
It's only in time that we
do things to make it weak.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.909
Now Bill and Cuddy, they
had to find something

17:56.943 --> 18:00.012
to make their hearts stronger
for what was a about to come.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.886
- I'd say we're
about 60 miles out.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.656
- And he won't be expecting
us, that's for sure.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.859
We gotta watch out for hostiles.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.330
You keep your eyes
peeled, Mr. Colt.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.071
We will get our man.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.007
- Oh, yes, we
always get our man.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.766
(screams)

19:28.268 --> 19:31.037
- You know, the spice on this?

19:31.070 --> 19:33.240
It's almost there but not quite.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.707
Rebecca!

19:34.741 --> 19:36.576
Salt and pepper, now!

19:38.044 --> 19:39.812
- Pass the water, please?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.682
- I think you've had
enough water already.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.083
- Excuse me?

19:44.116 --> 19:48.221
- Train was robbed, our
provisions were stolen.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.056
Do you know anything about that?

19:50.089 --> 19:51.991
- That was dumb bad luck.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.060
I had nothing to do with it.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.996
One could ask the same of you.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.931
- You know, if I think
that you're taking

19:58.965 --> 20:03.069
more than your share, I may
have to rethink our arrangement.

20:03.102 --> 20:07.073
- [Man in stripes] I had
nothing to do with it.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.842
- [Toggle] You mean you didn't
hire out the Robby brothers?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.043
- I did not.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.681
- That's damn bad luck.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.884
We're gonna have to
be extra careful.

20:19.886 --> 20:24.090
Move up our schedule.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.192
- Just because you rule
here, doesn't mean you

20:26.225 --> 20:29.228
have to tell me what
I need to be doing.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.198
- [Toggle] You ever kill a man?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.866
- What?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.068
- Oh, the reason I'm
out here in the west.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.704
A dead man.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.739
- Whom did you shoot?

20:39.772 --> 20:42.975
- A US Congressman,
a friend of many years.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.177
The fool was in
bed with my woman.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.114
I shot him, shot him dead.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.383
- That is a serious crime.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.084
- [Toggle] I know that.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.986
- Did you love her that much?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.790
- I couldn't stand the woman.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.327
I tried to poison her six times.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.062
Damn woman had a
cast-iron stomach.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.131
It was the principle
of the thing.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.099
- How long ago did this happen?

21:08.167 --> 21:09.902
- Ten years ago.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.071
I still feel my fingers wrapped

21:12.104 --> 21:14.674
around the trigger every day.

21:14.707 --> 21:18.311
- Why are you
telling me this now?

21:18.345 --> 21:22.315
- Well, there's no
doubt that we're

21:22.349 --> 21:25.418
doing well in the new West.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.087
The supplies come in,
we commandeer them,

21:28.120 --> 21:30.323
we control the flow
out of our towns

21:30.357 --> 21:32.659
and the surrounding areas.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.127
It's made us wealthy
and powerful.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.098
The reason I'm telling you this,

21:39.131 --> 21:41.768
is because I want
you to know I can

21:41.801 --> 21:45.838
render justice on anyone
who takes what's mine.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.775
My woman.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.276
My money.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.111
My land.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.713
Even my water.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.350
I don't give a rat's
behind who you are.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.119
Now this town is going
without provisions

22:00.152 --> 22:02.722
because I need the
money and supplies

22:02.755 --> 22:05.792
for a bigger opportunity
many states away.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.294
Now when's the next
shipment coming in?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.397
- Next Thursday at noon.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.665
- Now you get your tail up
on that hill with your boys,

22:12.699 --> 22:14.867
and you commandeer that caravan.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.836
We'll split it 50/50.

22:16.869 --> 22:19.005
And you make sure you let
some bullets get through.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.141
The Sheriff needs bullets.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.343
And with Marcus Robby
around, we'll need 'em too.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.813
- Well, when the townspeople
get wind of this,

22:26.846 --> 22:29.148
you're gonna need some
bullets too, my friend.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.883
- [Toggle] Indeed, I might.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.074
(birds chirping)

24:08.280 --> 24:10.016
(gunshot)

25:31.931 --> 25:33.032
(gunshot)

25:34.433 --> 25:36.235
- [Bill] Marcus!

25:38.404 --> 25:39.939
(gunshot)

26:07.066 --> 26:08.701
- So what's the plan, Sheriff?

26:08.735 --> 26:11.270
We gonna walk all the
way back to Cooperstown?

26:11.303 --> 26:13.039
You know, personally,
if it was up to me,

26:13.072 --> 26:15.074
I'd have put a bullet
between my eyes.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.677
You want to, huh?

26:19.979 --> 26:21.213
- [Bill] Damn it.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.483
- Did you lose something, Bill?

26:24.516 --> 26:28.655
(laughs)

26:28.688 --> 26:29.922
- Walk.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.925
(laughing)

27:13.700 --> 27:15.668
- Getting tired, Bill?

27:20.506 --> 27:24.143
Getting to be, yeah,
about that sleepy time.

27:42.528 --> 27:45.164
So are you gonna prepare
dinner or shall I?

28:04.450 --> 28:06.052
Thanks, Bill.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.236
Say, Bill!

28:25.704 --> 28:27.406
You look awful tired.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.745
Getting much sleep?

28:32.779 --> 28:35.414
I mean, I could sleep like
a baby anywhere, anytime.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.152
Just like a baby.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.426
What about you, Bill?

28:49.128 --> 28:50.396
- Shut up, Marcus.

28:55.501 --> 28:56.502
- Well.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.409
You have a good night, Bill.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.080
I'll take second
watch, all right.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.784
- I'm sorry, boss.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.654
It's all my fault.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.689
- Don't beat yourself up, Cutty.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.491
It could've happened to anyone.

29:52.524 --> 29:56.662
Marcus Robby,
he's, he's a snake.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.464
You're lucky he didn't
kill you flat out.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.501
- You really think he's
coming back, don't you?

30:13.679 --> 30:18.384
Sir, he said something
about your partner.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.523
- I guess it had to come
out sooner or later.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.362
Springfield, I was the sheriff.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.498
Phil Cohen and his boys, they
were tearing up the town.

30:34.766 --> 30:38.504
Guns, smoke, people
screaming and running.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.507
He wouldn't surrender.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.677
There was dust and
gun smoke everywhere,

30:45.711 --> 30:47.546
and I caught movement out
of the corner of my eye,

30:47.579 --> 30:51.217
and I fired, but when
the dust finally settled,

30:53.685 --> 30:56.555
well, Phil Cohen and most
of his men were dead,

30:58.790 --> 31:02.494
but so was Special Deputy
Marshal Mike Williams.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.130
Childhood friend.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.434
- Christ.

31:10.436 --> 31:14.073
- Anyway, I was relieved
of my duties as a marshal.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.441
Found a bottle.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.210
Crawled inside.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.713
Ended up here.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.783
The two that got away
were the Robby brothers.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.256
- You're making that up.

31:30.289 --> 31:35.227
- Well, still,
Marcus, he's coming.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.532
- Well, I'm with you.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.535
- Cutty, no, listen
to me, listen.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.538
I don't want you
anywhere near this.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.474
- This town hasn't seen
anything like this before.

31:49.441 --> 31:50.776
Ever.

31:50.809 --> 31:55.314
The most action I've seen is
when Hatford passes out drunk.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.117
- That's exactly why
I like this town.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.120
Cutty, there are people here
I'd rather see not get hurt.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.255
You understand?

32:04.323 --> 32:06.092
- No, can't do it.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.497
I am the epitome of
what a law man should be

32:11.530 --> 32:14.633
and I am filled with
boundless courage.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.439
- OK, go show me some of
that boundless courage

32:20.472 --> 32:23.475
and message for some
back up, all right?

32:23.509 --> 32:24.510
Go on.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.689
- Look at this
beautiful open country.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.128
It's the way God
wanted things to be.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.632
You know, there's nothing
like beautiful open country.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.770
Coming from a big city
like Philadelphia,

32:51.803 --> 32:54.706
you couldn't appreciate this
kind of beauty, now could you?

32:57.709 --> 32:59.178
- Well, we definitely
are a long way

32:59.211 --> 33:00.512
from the city of brotherly love.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.383
- Brotherly love?

33:04.416 --> 33:06.152
Not from this government.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.488
They are obsessed
with imperialism.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.491
- Manifest Destiny.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.427
- It's too bad the destiny
is manifested by force.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.298
- My grandfather
used to always say

33:19.331 --> 33:22.434
the day we stop growing
is the day we start dying.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.072
(gunshots)

33:34.080 --> 33:37.083
- You're gonna die if you bury
your head like an ostrich.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.786
- Today might be the day we die.

33:51.797 --> 33:55.567
- How is that for a
day in the Wild West?

33:55.601 --> 33:57.536
- That's a little
too exciting for me.

33:57.569 --> 34:01.407
I believe I might be sick,
throw up in your saddle bag.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.611
- Sure was wonderful, ma'am.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.579
- Yes, yes, it was.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.684
- You need to enjoy your life,

34:12.717 --> 34:15.353
of course it ain't promised.

34:15.387 --> 34:19.358
You need to enjoy it now,
because it goes pretty fast.

34:19.391 --> 34:24.230
You need to enjoy your
life more than ever.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.598
How much do I owe ya?

34:26.632 --> 34:28.400
- I don't know, surprise me.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.601
- [Man] Well, I am a gentleman,

34:30.636 --> 34:33.139
and I would never take
advantage of a lady.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.474
- I'm sure you won't.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.476
- This is for you.

34:37.509 --> 34:41.547
- [Malena] Oh, you
are a gentleman.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.781
- When I come back through town,

34:42.813 --> 34:44.449
I sure would like
to see you again.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.121
Assuming the Marcus Robby
gang doesn't wipe it clean.

34:50.156 --> 34:54.293
- Well, I'm sure you and
Toggle have plans, yes?

34:54.326 --> 34:57.629
I mean, you two are
as thick as thieves.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.799
- Toggle keeps his
thoughts to himself.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.634
- [Malena] And you?

35:02.668 --> 35:05.171
- Toggle seems more likely
to let the town burn

35:05.204 --> 35:06.472
then do it any good.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.607
He hired that inept
sheriff responsible

35:08.640 --> 35:10.476
for the Springfield massacre.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.644
- Bill is a good man.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.181
- Toggle and I have
plans to go over.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.582
- Toggle.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.184
- Ma'am, I do not
like to hear you

35:18.217 --> 35:20.819
talk about him, a
gentleman, in that manner.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.789
Especially when I am
gainfully employed

35:23.822 --> 35:25.691
by his graciousness.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.260
- My apologies, I am sorry.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.095
What do I know?

35:30.128 --> 35:34.032
You just seem like a
kind man, and I like you.

35:35.534 --> 35:36.702
- Honestly?

35:36.735 --> 35:38.337
- Yeah.

35:38.370 --> 35:41.207
I see a dangerous,
powerful man like Toggle,

35:41.240 --> 35:45.511
and a good, strong
man like yourself

35:45.544 --> 35:50.182
and I don't know, I worry.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.551
- Worry for me, ma'am?

35:54.486 --> 35:55.621
- Yes.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.156
I don't know what
business it is you do,

35:58.190 --> 36:02.294
but once you're done and
Toggle gets what he wants

36:02.328 --> 36:05.531
and then only two people will
know what he's trying to do.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.667
Only two people will
share his secret.

36:10.436 --> 36:13.038
I wonder what'll happen
to that other person,

36:13.071 --> 36:15.474
once Toggle gets what he wants.

36:15.507 --> 36:20.312
What is it they say
about secrets and men?

36:20.346 --> 36:22.414
- Two can keep it,
if one is dead.

36:22.448 --> 36:25.817
- Yeah, that's it.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.053
- Ma'am, you have given
me something to ponder on.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.357
Very interesting thoughts.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.426
You have a good afternoon.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.079
- It's a bit early for that.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.581
- Where you been hiding?

36:55.614 --> 36:57.583
- The saloon, working.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.252
- Yeah, I'd really
like you to stop that.

37:00.286 --> 37:02.220
- You'd really like
me to stop that?

37:02.254 --> 37:04.222
Bill, I'd really
like a lot of things.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.525
- Well, you know, we've
talked about that.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.594
- No we haven't, not really.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.061
- There's nothing
I want out there.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.298
- All that I want is
out there, with you.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.432
- Yeah, can you
cut yourself away

37:13.465 --> 37:14.433
from Toggle's purse strings?

37:14.466 --> 37:15.734
- Can you?

37:15.767 --> 37:17.102
We're all on Toggle's payroll.

37:17.135 --> 37:17.736
- There's a difference.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.204
- Not from where I stand.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.273
You gave your loyalty
to a liar and a thief.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.608
- What do you mean
a liar and a thief?

37:22.641 --> 37:24.443
- You think you know what's
going on in this town, Bill,

37:24.476 --> 37:26.111
but you have no idea.

37:26.144 --> 37:27.579
- Malena, what are
you talking about?

37:27.613 --> 37:28.780
- Nothing, Bill.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.449
- Malena, what are you ta...

37:30.482 --> 37:32.418
Malena!

37:50.302 --> 37:51.437
- Gentlemen?

37:53.839 --> 37:56.442
I thank you in the
name of righteousness

37:57.543 --> 37:59.277
for answering this call quickly.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.451
I'd like to propose the toast,

38:05.484 --> 38:09.455
to a fine man, a worldly man,

38:09.488 --> 38:14.393
he wasn't a vile, treacherous,
snake sort of fella.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.496
Like me.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.402
No, he was a good man,

38:25.537 --> 38:28.006
and gentlemen, he
was my brother.

38:34.513 --> 38:39.050
I like to propose one more
toast to this great man.

38:39.084 --> 38:43.689
And here soon, we're
gonna exact righteous

38:43.722 --> 38:47.726
and swift justice on
those who did him harm.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.435
Ride out!

39:04.743 --> 39:08.580
* Redbone, riding
in the warm wind

39:08.614 --> 39:11.950
* Redbone, howling
at the moon beams

39:13.785 --> 39:17.055
* Redbone, sniffing
out the bad men

39:17.088 --> 39:20.392
* Sam Redbone says hang
'em from the oak tree *

39:21.359 --> 39:22.428
Hey Bill?

39:22.461 --> 39:23.695
It's nice weather
out today, isn't it?

39:23.729 --> 39:25.431
Huh?

39:25.464 --> 39:29.735
Why yes, Marcus,
it's a beautiful day,
thank you for asking.

39:29.768 --> 39:33.439
Do not mention it, Bill,
it's the least I could do.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.442
Hey Bill, hey Bill!

39:36.475 --> 39:39.578
Bill, did you get
any sleep last night?

39:39.611 --> 39:42.581
You're walking
like you're tired.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.383
Bill, you're killing
me, say something.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.987
Hey Bill, how'd you
sleep last night?

39:50.489 --> 39:52.424
Me, I slept like a baby.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.060
You got any babies, Bill?

40:01.767 --> 40:05.136
Oh Bill, you ain't
and you know it.

40:05.170 --> 40:09.441
You're an honor bound
man, you're a good man.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.445
And you have a job to do.

40:21.653 --> 40:25.491
- Next time you
see my gun, Marcus,

40:25.524 --> 40:27.325
I will end you.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.296
- I believe you.

40:31.329 --> 40:34.633
I'd shoot me good.

40:34.666 --> 40:38.103
Hey, at least we're talking
like proper friends.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.805
- We are are not talking.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.807
We are not friends.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.142
And I have got
nothing to say to you.

40:45.777 --> 40:49.214
- Oh, Bill, I think you do.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.283
I really do.

40:54.553 --> 40:58.456
Go ahead, ask,
ask that question.

41:00.559 --> 41:01.627
Ask it.

41:02.694 --> 41:03.795
Go on.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.463
Suits are straight.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.203
Go ahead, it's all right.

41:15.507 --> 41:16.708
- Why?

41:18.644 --> 41:20.078
- There it is.

41:21.547 --> 41:22.514
- Why her?

41:25.551 --> 41:26.518
- It's an honest question,

41:26.552 --> 41:28.186
that's a good question.

41:31.857 --> 41:36.728
I just don't have an
answer for you right now.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.571
(laughing)

41:51.109 --> 41:53.478
You're right, you're right,

41:53.511 --> 41:55.346
after you, sir.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.250
Sir?

43:06.484 --> 43:09.420
Horse would have been
good right about now, huh?

43:10.488 --> 43:12.190
My feet are killing me, Bill.

43:15.827 --> 43:17.595
Well, good night.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.139
- Marcus!

45:00.265 --> 45:03.068
- We need more bullets
to protect our families.

45:03.101 --> 45:05.203
Toggle is rationing
everything out,

45:05.236 --> 45:08.073
charging a premium
at his stores.

45:08.106 --> 45:11.209
- We barely have enough food
to last through the day.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.111
Where are the provisions?

45:13.144 --> 45:15.446
- I'm working on getting
those answers for you.

45:15.480 --> 45:18.283
For now, we need all
the able-bodied men

45:18.316 --> 45:20.451
who will bare arms
to protect this town.

45:20.485 --> 45:26.091
All women, all children,
need to stay indoors.

45:26.124 --> 45:29.627
The Sheriff has sent a telegram
to the militia for back-up.

45:31.329 --> 45:33.064
We'll see what happens.

45:34.499 --> 45:38.403
We need to protect ourselves.

45:38.436 --> 45:40.071
Everybody go home
to your families.

46:02.493 --> 46:04.762
- You know, you can't get
good beef jerky out west

46:04.796 --> 46:07.632
like you can in the big city.

46:07.665 --> 46:10.001
But you wouldn't know
anything about that.

46:10.035 --> 46:11.236
What do you eat out there?

46:11.269 --> 46:12.603
Wild grass or something?

46:12.637 --> 46:14.339
- We're here to make a deal.

46:14.372 --> 46:17.275
You said you wanted
to make a deal,

46:17.308 --> 46:18.743
that's why I'm here.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.812
So make your deal.

46:20.846 --> 46:22.180
- You Natives are all the same,

46:22.213 --> 46:24.149
always wanna get
straight to the point,

46:24.182 --> 46:28.286
always so greedy, always
wanting something you don't own.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.587
Did you ever hear
about something

46:29.620 --> 46:32.490
called Manifest
Destiny, young man?

46:32.523 --> 46:34.492
Your time is limited.

46:34.525 --> 46:36.127
The clock is ticking.

46:36.161 --> 46:38.129
- I beg to differ.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.131
I still don't hear our deal.

46:41.699 --> 46:46.337
- Yeah, well, making
good beef jerky

46:46.371 --> 46:49.507
is like making a good
deal, it's an art.

46:49.540 --> 46:52.177
So, here's my deal,

46:52.210 --> 46:53.644
a train is about to be raided,

46:53.678 --> 46:56.514
I want you and your
savages to be there,

46:56.547 --> 46:59.150
and to take care of the
men who do that raid.

46:59.184 --> 47:03.021
I want you to bring back the
goods, we'll split 50/50.

47:04.589 --> 47:06.491
I have traders coming
in in a couple of days,

47:06.524 --> 47:09.460
and they'll take up
all the provisions

47:09.494 --> 47:11.662
and pay us with fur.

47:11.696 --> 47:13.398
You like fur, don't you?

47:15.066 --> 47:16.634
- It's worth a lot these days.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.703
Even to us savages.

47:18.736 --> 47:20.738
- My thoughts exactly.

47:20.771 --> 47:24.042
So you take care of those men
and I'll take care of you.

47:24.075 --> 47:26.544
- What time exactly is
that shipment coming in?

47:26.577 --> 47:29.047
- It's supposed to arrive
around nine o'clock,

47:29.080 --> 47:30.815
but I want you there early.

47:30.848 --> 47:33.818
Now you savages, you're
out in the wilderness,

47:33.851 --> 47:35.686
camp out.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.688
- How do I know you're
not gonna double cross me?

47:39.524 --> 47:40.658
- You don't know.

47:40.691 --> 47:45.563
- But if you do, you will
learn why the white man

47:45.596 --> 47:49.700
call my people
"Savages," my friend.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.471
- Now you've given
me indigestion.

48:00.111 --> 48:02.080
- [Clarissa] Now just
what are you doing, James?

48:02.113 --> 48:03.248
- Practicing.

48:03.281 --> 48:04.582
- Well, they ain't coming back.

48:04.615 --> 48:07.218
They're just blowing
smoke is all.

48:10.455 --> 48:12.423
- Bill seems to think otherwise.

48:12.457 --> 48:14.292
The whole town's
arming themselves,

48:14.325 --> 48:16.127
even though he told them not to.

48:16.161 --> 48:18.263
- What do you know
about outlaws?

48:18.296 --> 48:20.231
You're just a cowboy hand.

48:23.468 --> 48:25.236
- What do you know about
outlaws and lawmen?

48:25.270 --> 48:29.774
- It's OK, I like you
just the way you are.

48:29.807 --> 48:33.444
Even if your hands
are as soft as butter.

48:33.478 --> 48:36.447
Some men ain't made
for this type of work.

48:36.481 --> 48:39.084
Why don't you just
accept it, James?

48:39.117 --> 48:41.419
- I ain't gotta accept nothing.

48:45.490 --> 48:48.559
When those goons get back,
I'm gonna protect this town.

48:48.593 --> 48:50.428
- I hear the Sheriff
doesn't want you

48:50.461 --> 48:52.063
anywhere near this town.

48:52.097 --> 48:54.499
Heard he shot his
partner in cold blood.

48:54.532 --> 48:55.800
- That ain't true.

48:55.833 --> 48:57.935
It was an accident.

48:59.470 --> 49:00.605
Were you listening?

49:00.638 --> 49:02.473
- I was gonna come
by and surprise you,

49:02.507 --> 49:07.678
but I heard, I'm sorry.

49:07.712 --> 49:09.447
- Just hold your
tongue about that.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.316
- Do you really
think they're coming?

49:11.349 --> 49:12.450
I hope not.

49:12.483 --> 49:14.652
But if they do,
I'll protect you.

49:14.685 --> 49:16.587
- Will you?

49:16.621 --> 49:20.625
Then you may kiss me,
before I come to my senses.

49:27.498 --> 49:29.134
- Stand back.

49:45.716 --> 49:47.485
- Shouldn't you be inside?

49:47.518 --> 49:48.819
- I seriously doubt
those outlaws are going

49:48.853 --> 49:51.056
to harm an innocent woman.

49:51.089 --> 49:53.224
- Yeah, well, just
in case Marcus Robby

49:53.258 --> 49:55.193
isn't feeling really
warm and tender,

49:55.226 --> 49:56.827
maybe you should
get somewhere safe.

49:56.861 --> 49:59.364
- Why, Bill, is that
concern for my safety?

49:59.397 --> 50:00.665
- Malena, that's not fair.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.500
- I'm sorry.

50:04.535 --> 50:05.503
- Me too.

50:06.871 --> 50:08.239
Me too.

50:10.241 --> 50:12.343
- So there are rumors.

50:12.377 --> 50:13.378
- I've heard.

50:13.411 --> 50:14.512
- Any truth?

50:14.545 --> 50:17.515
- [Bill] Some.

50:17.548 --> 50:18.849
- People say you're not
fit to wear that badge,

50:18.883 --> 50:21.018
because of what
happened in Springfield.

50:29.094 --> 50:30.661
- What do you think?

50:30.695 --> 50:33.498
- I think somewhere
past the self-loathing

50:33.531 --> 50:36.567
and the whiskey,
there's a good man.

50:36.601 --> 50:38.769
- Yeah, maybe.

50:40.571 --> 50:41.572
- At least now I
know where you go

50:41.606 --> 50:44.109
when you get that
look on you face.

50:45.576 --> 50:47.478
- Springfield was a massacre.

50:48.713 --> 50:50.215
- I'm so sorry.

50:51.582 --> 50:53.084
- The Robby brothers got away.

50:54.585 --> 50:56.487
And my house was
just outside of town.

50:57.788 --> 50:59.424
They made one last stop.

51:00.591 --> 51:03.461
- Oh my god, Bill.

51:03.494 --> 51:05.596
- So I'll be damned if
I'm gonna let Marcus Robby

51:05.630 --> 51:07.798
turn this into
another Springfield.

51:07.832 --> 51:09.734
So you get somewhere safe.

51:18.509 --> 51:21.078
- At least now I know
what you're looking for.

51:21.112 --> 51:22.413
- What's that?

51:23.514 --> 51:25.250
- Redemption.

51:31.756 --> 51:34.492
- What the hell are
you looking at boy?

51:34.525 --> 51:37.295
Do you really know what's
fitting to happen here?

51:37.328 --> 51:39.297
Them Robby boys?

51:39.330 --> 51:43.301
They're gonna sweep through
this place like a sandstorm.

51:43.334 --> 51:45.770
They're gonna level this
place to the ground.

51:55.546 --> 51:58.816
Drink up and be merry,
for the end is near.

51:58.849 --> 52:02.453
I believe that it says
that in the good book.

52:04.622 --> 52:06.457
I'm gonna miss this place.

52:16.401 --> 52:19.003
You know, when I
was a young man,

52:20.705 --> 52:23.474
I was attacked by a
vicious tribe of Indians.

52:25.510 --> 52:28.446
I was out trapping furs,

52:28.479 --> 52:31.482
and I was getting ready
to haul in a big score.

52:33.551 --> 52:37.488
I fell asleep at the wrong
place and the wrong time.

52:39.390 --> 52:40.691
Dropped this coin.

52:42.693 --> 52:44.529
Arrows flew by my head.

52:46.564 --> 52:48.233
I bent over, tried to grab it,

52:48.266 --> 52:52.403
and that's when the
arrows flew past me.

52:52.437 --> 52:55.840
This here coin, it's
gotta be the luckiest coin

52:55.873 --> 52:58.409
on God's green Earth.

53:12.790 --> 53:15.726
This here coin's
gonna protect me.

53:19.397 --> 53:24.369
You know, you might call
an old man superstitious,

53:27.738 --> 53:30.741
but this is not why I'm afraid.

53:30.775 --> 53:35.513
This thing's gonna protect
me from everything.

53:35.546 --> 53:37.348
So everybody's
gotta have something

53:37.382 --> 53:39.049
in this world to hang on to.

53:46.457 --> 53:50.428
- Relax your shoulder,
relax, breathe.

53:50.461 --> 53:52.263
Being in a gun fight,
it's not always about

53:52.297 --> 53:56.267
who draws the fastest, it's
who's got the best aim.

53:56.301 --> 53:58.436
You did fine when we
faced the Robby brothers.

53:58.469 --> 54:00.438
You'll do fine again.

54:00.471 --> 54:02.440
- Thanks.

54:02.473 --> 54:05.209
- Try not to think about
it, that's what eats you up.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.177
- Easy for you to say.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.449
- Tell you what.

54:11.482 --> 54:14.251
Make sure everybody's
inside, all right?

54:26.497 --> 54:27.632
- Clarissa?

54:27.665 --> 54:30.435
- Can you talk?

54:30.468 --> 54:32.102
- Yeah.

54:32.136 --> 54:34.805
- Everybody's barricading
themselves inside.

54:34.839 --> 54:38.476
These people really think
they're gonna die today.

54:38.509 --> 54:41.512
Are these guys really
that dangerous?

54:41.546 --> 54:43.514
- I'm afraid so.

54:43.548 --> 54:46.651
In fact, I don't understand why
you're not inside right now.

54:46.684 --> 54:50.321
- But I am worried about Cutty.

54:50.355 --> 54:54.124
People are saying
all sorts of things,

54:54.158 --> 54:56.594
but he believes in you.

54:56.627 --> 54:59.597
I want your promise that
you'll keep him safe.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.165
- [Bill] I promise.

55:04.234 --> 55:05.202
- [Cutty] Clarissa?

55:05.235 --> 55:06.136
- Cutty.

55:07.372 --> 55:08.205
- Bill?

55:08.238 --> 55:09.239
- Cutty.

55:11.376 --> 55:13.010
I'll let you two talk.

55:15.346 --> 55:16.514
- What are you doing here?

55:16.547 --> 55:18.349
- I had to see you.

55:18.383 --> 55:20.351
- I can't protect you if I
don't know where you are.

55:20.385 --> 55:23.253
- You should know by now that
I can take care of myself.

55:24.522 --> 55:26.023
You've always been sweet on me,

55:26.056 --> 55:28.493
and I never thought
you were a coward.

55:28.526 --> 55:30.495
- Well, that's good to hear.

55:30.528 --> 55:34.832
- I want you to know that,
that I've decided that,

55:34.865 --> 55:37.368
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

55:37.402 --> 55:39.737
- You've decided?

55:39.770 --> 55:41.506
- I'm strong-willed.

55:41.539 --> 55:42.507
- You're stubborn.

55:42.540 --> 55:44.074
- I'm strong-willed!

55:48.178 --> 55:49.514
- Go home.

55:49.547 --> 55:52.650
Lock it up, stay in a corner
until this is all over.

55:52.683 --> 55:54.819
You understand?

55:54.852 --> 55:57.522
- It comes down to this,

55:57.555 --> 56:00.425
I love you, gunfighter or not,

56:00.458 --> 56:04.429
and I will not let you get hurt.

56:04.462 --> 56:08.032
And that's all that matters,
do you understand me?

56:09.567 --> 56:11.402
- You have a way with words.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.605
- You may kiss me again.

56:22.780 --> 56:24.515
- Let me walk you home.

56:24.549 --> 56:25.750
- I'd like that.

56:33.491 --> 56:35.292
- Well, thank you, son.

56:35.325 --> 56:38.362
Now these boys had no
idea what to expect,

56:38.395 --> 56:40.431
what was coming.

56:40.465 --> 56:43.468
But best they knew, it wasn't
gonna be anything good,

56:43.501 --> 56:45.470
so they had to be brave.

56:45.503 --> 56:47.738
- It's better to be
brave than scared.

56:47.772 --> 56:51.308
- Well, being brave doesn't
mean you ain't scared, son.

56:51.341 --> 56:53.811
It's just that you don't
let the fear stop you.

56:53.844 --> 56:57.482
And the men in this town,
they definitely were brave.

56:57.515 --> 56:59.484
That's for sure.

57:07.492 --> 57:11.962
- A nation without justice,
will consume itself.

57:19.504 --> 57:21.305
Boys?

57:25.209 --> 57:29.113
Today, we're gonna
be judge, jury,

57:30.180 --> 57:31.448
and executioner.

57:35.520 --> 57:38.656
Those barbarians
murdered an innocent man,

57:38.689 --> 57:41.492
an innocent man,
who had every right

57:41.526 --> 57:45.462
to defend himself against
the cheats of this world.

57:46.831 --> 57:48.365
Fact is fact.

57:49.534 --> 57:52.036
Truth is truth.

57:52.069 --> 57:55.472
I had to wash my brother's
blood off of my hands.

57:59.043 --> 58:00.377
I don't care what y'all do,

58:02.479 --> 58:04.214
Bill Hickok is mine.

58:06.717 --> 58:09.520
You leave him to me.

58:09.554 --> 58:12.489
- Some people will wonder
why I'm so relaxed,

58:12.523 --> 58:15.793
given the current
state of affairs.

58:15.826 --> 58:19.229
Men coming to destroy
my town and all.

58:21.198 --> 58:24.334
Experience in life,
I know one thing,

58:25.402 --> 58:27.572
every man has a price.

58:27.605 --> 58:29.373
There's always a
deal to be made.

58:32.509 --> 58:35.713
That no good sheriff.

58:35.746 --> 58:38.716
If I'd known that shell of
a man would grow a spine,

58:38.749 --> 58:40.417
I'd have left him to die.

58:43.588 --> 58:45.723
Half the people
don't listen to him

58:45.756 --> 58:48.425
and the other half
think he's a fool.

58:50.527 --> 58:53.497
When those outlaws get
here, I'll reason with them.

58:53.530 --> 58:56.333
We'll work out
something, you'll see.

58:56.366 --> 58:59.303
There's always a
deal to be made.

59:03.273 --> 59:04.408
Now, you watch
what you're doing,

59:04.441 --> 59:06.176
you pay attention!

59:06.210 --> 59:08.345
Honestly, I don't know
why I put up with you.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.413
- [Rebecca] I'm sorry.

59:09.446 --> 59:11.181
- Not one more knick.

59:11.215 --> 59:12.416
- [Rebecca] OK.

59:12.449 --> 59:15.152
- Good help is so hard to find.

59:21.659 --> 59:23.427
- Now, what is this?

59:23.460 --> 59:25.462
What is this?

59:25.495 --> 59:27.131
- He's having a piss.

59:27.164 --> 59:28.132
- [Man in grey] Yeah, he's
having a piss right in the road,

59:28.165 --> 59:29.433
right in the middle of the road.

59:29.466 --> 59:30.434
- It's all right, we'll
just ride around him.

59:30.467 --> 59:31.636
No, it's a matter of principle.

59:31.669 --> 59:33.103
He can move off, not us.

59:36.173 --> 59:37.441
Hey!

59:37.474 --> 59:40.110
Why don't you take your
piss somewhere else?

59:40.144 --> 59:42.446
- Excuse me, mister, you
mind stepping off the road?

59:42.479 --> 59:44.448
- Hey, I'm done when I'm done.

59:44.481 --> 59:46.416
You got an issue with that?

59:46.450 --> 59:49.119
Oh, a law dog, huh?

59:49.153 --> 59:51.421
Come on down here
and talk to me?

59:54.491 --> 59:55.760
- I'm trying.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.679
- I'd prefer to shoot him
right between his eyes.

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:17.481
He killed a man, a good
man, an honorable man.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:20.084
I don't believe he deserves
to live one second longer

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.286
once we find him.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:23.620
The last thing I wanna
do is babysit him

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:25.155
all the way back to the capital,

01:00:25.189 --> 01:00:28.659
that'll be the roughest
ride of your life.

01:00:28.693 --> 01:00:30.460
- Well, I have my pains
and you have yours.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:36.500
- You're a government man.

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:39.469
What do you say we flip a coin?

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:43.774
- Certainly I've been known
to place a bet or two.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:45.342
- Heads I get to shoot
him where he stands

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.476
and tails you get to babysit him

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:48.378
all the way back to the capital.

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:51.148
- Do you find it necessary
to flip this coin right now?

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:52.216
- No, I don't.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:54.651
I say we add a
little excitement,

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:56.220
a little drama to this journey.

01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:59.056
We wait until we find him.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.657
- Excellent, Mr. Colt.

01:01:01.726 --> 01:01:02.793
Shall we move out?

01:01:02.827 --> 01:01:03.994
- Carry on.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.733
* Abeleen, Abeleen

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:11.035
* Prettiest girl I ever seen

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:14.705
* Abeleen, Abeleen

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.441
Come on, boys.

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:20.577
- These guns are fully-loaded,

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.146
but that's the last
of the bullets,

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.681
so take your time and
choose your shots wisely.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.450
- You bet.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:31.321
- I'm gonna put you in
as safe a place as I can,

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:33.590
but do not go
looking for a fight,

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.525
you let them come to you.

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:36.260
Do you understand?

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:36.794
- Got it.

01:01:44.568 --> 01:01:45.535
- He's here.

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:48.272
- Everyone out the back, go on.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:51.275
- You stay in here,
and you stay safe,

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:52.542
understand?

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:02.052
- Sheriff?

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:06.423
Hickok?

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.259
People of Toggleville!

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:11.461
Bring that sheriff out to me!

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:13.998
I got some justice for him,

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:18.102
and everybody else'll live.

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:21.005
If you don't, you all gonna die.

01:02:26.811 --> 01:02:28.478
Tear it up, boys.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:31.648
(gunshots)

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.466
(suspenseful music)

01:03:24.068 --> 01:03:25.335
Sheriff!

01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:33.310
Hickok!

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.658
(gunshots)

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:19.489
- Rebecca, Rebecca!

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.391
Saddle my horse!

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.393
- You want me to go out there?

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:25.129
- Now, woman!

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.561
- It's hard to explain, but in

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:00.564
a lawman's deepest
time of turmoil,

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:04.434
somehow it always turns
out to be his finest hour.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.403
- What do you mean, papa?

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.306
- Well, what it means, son,

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.775
is the true
definition of bravery.

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:16.213
Standing up for good in the
face of tremendous adversity.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.447
When the chips are down.

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.449
- What are the chips?

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:22.219
- Don't be in a rush
to grow old, son.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.121
You'll find out soon enough.

01:05:44.108 --> 01:05:45.442
- [Cutty] Bill!

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:53.450
- Cutty!

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.487
Cutty!

01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.123
Come on, come on.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:06.163
- [Cutty] Bill...

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:07.031
- It's all right.

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:08.565
Hey, be good, you're good.

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:12.502
I need bullets.

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:14.038
- Pocket.

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:21.478
- You stay here, all right?

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:23.313
You stay here, you stay low.

01:07:11.095 --> 01:07:12.696
- Bill Hickok!

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:16.400
Where are you?

01:07:19.103 --> 01:07:20.604
Come on out!

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:23.407
Come on out and
answer for the crime

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:27.043
you committed
against my brother!

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:31.248
Come on out, Bill.

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:34.418
I ain't gonna bite.

01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:38.422
All right,

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:45.429
if you can outdraw
me, I'll surrender.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:47.464
Huh?

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:49.433
You hear me?

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.135
I know you hear me.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:53.437
Come on.

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:08.118
- Bill, don't do it!

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:13.423
- Bill?

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.261
- Marcus.

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:18.627
(gunshots)

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.451
- Are you all right?

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:42.719
- Yeah, yeah.

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:50.460
- Oww, ow.

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:53.796
- You're hurt!

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:55.365
- You saved my life.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.435
- Cutty?

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.636
- [Bill] Cutty.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.071
- Let's get you cleaned up.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.386
- Where are you
coming from, sir?

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.554
- Toggleville.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.657
- You're not up to no
good out here, are ya?

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.026
- Just trying to
make an honest buck

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:25.028
in a dishonest way, sir.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.395
- Well, we're
looking for a fella,

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:28.131
maybe you can help us find him.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.466
- I do know that man.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.569
Not proud to say so,
but it is a fact.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:35.171
- Maybe you could let us know

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:37.474
where we can locate this fella.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.707
- We know we're close.

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:42.345
- Just about 4 miles
east, in a brown house,

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:46.416
sitting on the corner, you will
find that evil rat bastard.

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:47.484
- Why, thank you, sir,

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:48.818
for your service to
the US government.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.554
- And you have a nice day, sir.

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:13.443
- Seems like we
always get our man.

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:16.246
- Yep, it seems like it's
time to flip that coin.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.514
- You're not serious.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.416
- Serious as ever.

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:23.119
Heads.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.755
Justice will be served.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:35.465
- Why do I always
agree to these things?

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.550
- [Malena] Sheriff?

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.319
- [Bill] Madame?

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:56.453
- And how are you?

01:10:56.486 --> 01:10:58.254
- Fine, just fine.

01:10:58.288 --> 01:10:59.723
- [Malena] What are
you thinking about?

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.325
- Nothing.

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:03.627
- Right, where do you go?

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:07.464
- Well, I got an
offer to be a marshal

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:09.333
up in the Deadwood Territories.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:11.100
- Ah.

01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:16.105
- Yeah, and I'm thinking
you should come with me.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:20.344
- Really?

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:22.479
I don't know,
this saloon, I mean,

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:24.481
this is my life.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:26.316
- Really?

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:28.385
That does present a problem.

01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:32.356
- Truth is,
I'm a little nervous.

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:34.290
- Truth is, so am I.

01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:37.361
Come with me.

01:11:37.394 --> 01:11:39.195
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.830
We can leave tomorrow morning,
if you'd like.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.499
- I'll think about it.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.334
- You'll think about it.

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:47.504
- And what about here?

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:50.106
- With Toggle gone and
Rebecca spilling the beans

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.307
about everything he's done,

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:52.509
I think this town's
gonna be just fine.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:56.680
Besides, I hear the new
sheriff is a good man.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.119
- I guess I'll pack my bags.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.655
- Well, I guess
I'll come with you.

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:09.325
- So, Toggle, he eventually
got what was coming to him.

01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:11.695
If you do bad things,
bad things happen.

01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:14.130
- So, what ever
happened to Bill?

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:18.502
- Well, that, my son,
is a much longer story.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:21.438
- I can't wait to grow
up to be a law man.

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.774
- And I'm sure
you'll be a good one.

01:12:41.425 --> 01:12:44.428
I've got something I
wanna give you, son.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:47.531
You're great-grandfather
never lost that coin.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:51.234
It stayed in our family
for many years as a symbol,

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:54.203
a symbol of great
bravery and courage.

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:59.075
As you go out into this
world, always remember

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:02.512
who you are and
where you came from.

01:13:02.546 --> 01:13:05.549
And don't ever compromise
your values for anyone,

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:09.553
because we are the law, hm?

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.781
- Anyone see you?

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.088
Come on.

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:52.195
* If you love me,
I'll be waiting

01:13:54.498 --> 01:13:59.035
* If you don't, don't lead me on

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:04.608
* If you want me, tell me

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:09.646
* I need to know

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:12.982
* If you love me,
don't let me go

01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:19.789
* Well, I'm just a simple man

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:23.459
* I'm really no mystery

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:28.998
* What you see is just what I am

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:35.505
* I make my way in the world

01:14:35.539 --> 01:14:38.508
* And I can make it alone

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:44.480
* But if you love me,
don't let me go

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:51.120
* Because there's a whole
lot of man right here

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:55.525
* With a whole lot
of love to share

01:14:55.559 --> 01:14:58.562
* My mom and daddy
raised me right

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:01.497
* Tip your hat, son,
and be polite

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.169
* There's someone for everyone

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:11.307
* We need to have some faith

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.477
* Well, God has a plan

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.413
* So let him do his thing

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:24.253
* But if you go again

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:27.824
* This time

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.694
* Take your memories

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:35.064
* Out of my mind

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:37.400
* Just walk away

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:50.413
* Well I need you girl,
but that ain't fair to me

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:56.452
* One-sided love
always feels alone

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:04.393
* Forgive my tears, I'm
sorry, just feeling low

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:11.601
* If you love me,
don't let me go

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.742
* Because there's a whole
lotta man right here

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:21.577
* With a whole
lotta love to share

01:16:23.479 --> 01:16:26.449
* My mom and daddy
raised me right

01:16:26.482 --> 01:16:29.418
* Tip your hat, son,
and be polite

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:34.590
* One last kiss goodbye

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:39.996
* And you need to know

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:44.600
* If you love me,
don't let me go
