02:02.760 --> 02:04.046
Son of a bitch.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.726
Son of a bitch, my son.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.328
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.841
I can't believe this shit.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.481
I can't believe
this shit.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.085
I always knew.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.330
Buttercup,

What are you doing, huh?

02:22.720 --> 02:25.246
What are you doing out here,
huh?

02:25.480 --> 02:28.006
You sleeping in the barn now?

02:28.240 --> 02:29.651
Let's go to the house with me.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.521
That's a good girl.
Good girl, yeah.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.651
Good girl.
Good girl.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.764
Come on, girl.
Let's up to the house.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.240
What?

02:47.680 --> 02:49.682
Don't wake up, Pedro.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.445
Don't wake up him.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.002
What? What?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.925

Easy, easy.

Yeah. Hello?

03:51.480 --> 03:53.687
Maria.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.042
Oh, what's that?

I'll be right there. Hold on.
I'm coming. Hold on.

04:02.520 --> 04:03.521
I'll be there.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.963
All right!
Party's over, boys. Back off.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.481
Get off my property
and away from my people.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.609
I mean it now.
Go back to your own country.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.322
- All right!
- Go on.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.801
This guy, his wife died,
that's his son,

04:38.080 --> 04:39.650
and he wants a better life
for the boy here.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.160
They want him back over there.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.528
Thank you.
You saved my ass.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.086
You hear that?
We're gonna keep him.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.209
Now go on. Go on back.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.044
Yeah.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.080
Take him back to your place
and get some food and rest.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.210
And call the proper authorities
or maybe not.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.370
I'll leave that up to you,
all right? Okay.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.921
Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.687
<i>Go on now.
Go on back. Go on.</i>

05:05.920 --> 05:07.843
If you come back,
I'll shoot your legs

05:08.080 --> 05:09.525
right out from under you.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.161
I can do that.
All right?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.448
Don't cross this river again.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.682
Stay off my property.
Stay out of Texas.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.404
Texas Rangers!

05:25.800 --> 05:27.450
Texas Rangers!

05:48.480 --> 05:51.051
Hey, children.
What is your name?

05:51.320 --> 05:53.641
Hey, sweetheart.
Show me your cars.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.165
You ready to come out?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.971
- Yes.
- Yes? Let's go.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.090
Come. Come with me.
There you go.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.085
There you go.
Yes, let's go.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.244
- All right, there you go, sweetie, come on.
- Here's your car.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.091
Woman: This is dispatch.
What's your situation?

06:24.360 --> 06:27.125
- Leave that car.
- Sheriff, it's the captain.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.801
This is a bad one,
real bad.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.530
I need some help over here.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.161
Please send Scott over here
as soon as you can.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.448
Let me see your motor,
your car

06:36.680 --> 06:38.489
Wow!
Where is the fastest car here?

06:38.720 --> 06:41.690
This one.
This car is the fastest.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.123
Come on.
Come on. Okay.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.363
Have you ever thought
about quitting the Rangers?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.165
Yeah, I have.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.562
I hope someday that I never
have to interview

07:39.800 --> 07:43.805
another rape victim
or a burned child

07:44.040 --> 07:45.963
or see another
mutilated body.

07:49.520 --> 07:53.081
Not many people
can do our job, Sam.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.010
Most people would go insane.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.331
Hi, it's me.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.967
You doing your homework?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.282
You going riding later?

08:28.560 --> 08:30.050
Okay.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.005
We'll have dinner tonight
in a fun place, okay?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.964
All right.
Hugs.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.765
Bye.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.003
Absolutely, yes.

09:08.240 --> 09:12.370
I was explaining to Ms. Davis
that we never close a cold case.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.171
I'll leave you two
to talk about it.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.485
Thank you very much.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.371
S0 I'm sorry about your loss,
Mrs. Davis.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.568
Thank you very much.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.404
What was your son's name?

09:26.640 --> 09:28.369
Jimmy.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.409
What else can you tell me
about your son?

09:30.640 --> 09:35.043
Well, he was a very good,
very good, wonderful person.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.642
I want you to find out
if my son was killed

09:46.880 --> 09:48.450
and who killed him.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.728
I will speak
with the head Ranger,

09:50.960 --> 09:55.727
the Captain that you just met,
and we'll go into the files

09:55.960 --> 09:58.201
and we'll do our best
to give you an answer.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.885
Thank you very much.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.764
Who was in charge
of the Jimmy Davis case

10:05.040 --> 10:07.850
- 15 years ago?
- That would have been Ranger Jackson,

10:08.120 --> 10:10.282
- and he retired about two years ago.
- Yeah.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.682
He was in charge
of the office back then.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.883
You know, quite honestly,
Sam, I don’t--

10:15.120 --> 10:16.451
I know about the case,

10:16.680 --> 10:18.364
but I don't know much
about the details.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.206
But I did find the case file.
I want you to have it.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.489
Good thing is,
Ranger Jackson is gonna be here

10:24.760 --> 10:26.410
day after tomorrow
for the town barbecue.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.489
It'd be a really good time
for you to sit down with him

10:28.720 --> 10:30.563
- and get the details on it.
- Sure.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.245
Yeah, I really wanna work
on this case,

10:32.520 --> 10:33.806
- if it's okay with you.
- You got it.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.442
Get those feet out
in front of you, Buster.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.490
Girl: You're doing
pretty darn good, Buster,

10:40.720 --> 10:43.405
for a little squirt your size.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.722
Buster: Watch me.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.644
Easy on the bit.
Come on.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.245
Come on, Buster.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.964
Maybe someday you can
out ride me.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.884
Let go of that horn, Buster.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.327
Buster: I'm starting
to ride like John Wayne!

10:57.560 --> 11:02.009
Riding like John Wayne's cousin.
Buster, your grandpa's here.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.844
How am I doing, grandpa?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.003
You're doing pretty damn good.
Don't talk to me.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.607
Just listen to KC, all right?
He'll teach you.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.922
Starting to get good enough
so's he can ride your horse.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.891
- That's not gonna happen for a while.
- That's what I told him.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.531
She can do it,
but he can't, no.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.570
Hey, I wanna show you
something.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.371
Hey, kids.
Come on!

11:21.600 --> 11:23.841
Man: Got a strange phone call
last night

11:24.120 --> 11:25.770
with some woman's voice
attached to it.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.083
Didn't belong to me.
Wrong number.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.084
Yeah, it's hard enough
to make one work, Pop,

11:31.320 --> 11:33.448
let alone two at the same time,
it ain't easy.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.605
Yeah, well, don't join
my divorce club.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.282
Try to avoid that.
Tell you that right now.

11:47.920 --> 11:52.482
Watch,
you'll get an education.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.449
Reminds me of when
you were a teenager.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.481
Hey)'-

12:12.520 --> 12:13.521
Buster:
Go get him, Pa.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.603
Man:
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.885

12:33.800 --> 12:36.167
Shh, Shh, Shh, Shh,
Shh, Shh, Shh, Shh.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.889
You boys have good touch.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.607
That's a good girl.
Come here, touch her.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.285
Come on. Yeah.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.603
Put your hand out here.
Yeah.

13:00.840 --> 13:05.129
Bite his hand off.
Bite his hand off.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.931
That's good. That's good.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.322
You've been working him good,
son.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.523
Good work.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.603

13:14.840 --> 13:16.729
Who's hungry?

Last one in the truck's

Gonna be you, old man.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.124

Okay. Okay, go on.
Get on. I'll be right down.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.041
Buster:

Go ahead.
I'll be right back.

- Hey, Buster.
- Hey, Buster! Get your hand out of there.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.446
What'd I tell you about eating
other people's food, huh?

14:49.320 --> 14:50.765
How you doing?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.446
Milo,
don't overcook that meat.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.286
Yeah.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.524
Good to see everybody.
Right. Have a good time.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.285
Good to see you.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.564
Hey, Pa.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.126
What are you doing?

15:14.360 --> 15:15.885
I don't know.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.363
Just looking at those horses
over there.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.165
Man:
I wish your ma could've come.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.920
- Me too.
- Yeah.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.920
You think, uh...

15:30.160 --> 15:32.731
you think your mom
would let me move back in?

15:32.960 --> 15:34.928
- Of course.
- Are you serious?

15:35.200 --> 15:37.089
Yeah.
She was talking about you.

15:37.320 --> 15:41.882
She saying she want me there?
Yeah?

15:42.160 --> 15:44.811
Why do you think
she don't want you there?

15:47.520 --> 15:52.048
I don't know.
You know your ma.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.045
She changes her mind a lot.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.521
Well, that's who I got it from.
I got all jacked up.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.405
- Mr. Briggs, how you doing?
- Good to see you, sir.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.762
I wanna introduce you
to Texas Ranger Samantha Payne.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.004
- Hello, sir, nice meeting you.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.288
- My son, Cody.
- Cody, good to see you.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.363
I'll see you guys
in a minute.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.568
Thank you.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.280
Yeah, I never met
a lady Ranger before.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.851
I didn't know they had 'em.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.531
Yeah,
we can vote now as well.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.683
That's good.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.167
Buster-- Buster?

16:25.400 --> 16:27.323
Buster Briggs,
where you at?

16:27.560 --> 16:31.326
I want you to meet
a lady Texas Ranger.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.449
- Hi,
- Hello, sir. Nice handshake.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.051
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

16:35.280 --> 16:37.203
- Good. You having fun?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.805
- Excellent.
- That's her son Cody.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.644
Nice to meet you.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.962
Maybe I can be a Texas Ranger
when I grow up.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.884
- You want to?
- Yes, sir.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.805
I thought you said you wanted
to run the ranch with me.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.930
Yes, sir, but even
if you're 100, I could do both.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.447
No, wait a minute.
What do you mean you'll do both?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.569
I don't know about that.
Well, we'll see.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.246
Let me think about it.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.448
You're not very good
at work, son.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.728
Go learn to be a cowboy.
Go on, get out of here.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.401
Cody, go get some...
I'll see you in a minute.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.005
Oh, God almighty.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.083
- Yeah, they're something.
- They are.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.163
- Listen, let me ask you something.
- Yes, sir.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.528
- In two weeks, we're gonna have
a competitive cook-off.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.006
- Okay.
- I would like to invite you and your son

17:15.240 --> 17:17.527
as my special guests.
- Well, I appreciate that.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.483
And thank you so much
for having us.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.000
Very nice party.
Thank you, sir.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.208
- Ma'am.
- Nice meeting you.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.211
Look what rolled in.
Nice to see you, sheriff.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.323
- How are you, Scott?
- Good to see you. Good to see you.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.404
- Deputy, good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.689
Well, I don't know
if Ranger Captain mentioned,

17:39.920 --> 17:42.321
I took over
the Jimmy Davis case,

17:42.560 --> 17:45.484
and the files and notes
indicate

17:45.720 --> 17:49.486
that the kid maybe,
possibly committed suicide.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.202
Well, little lady, first thing,
I don't think it was suicide.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.603
And I said the obvious suspect

17:56.880 --> 18:00.123
in this case was Scott Briggs.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.249
Maria:
And what was the evidence then?

18:02.480 --> 18:06.610
Well, his son,
the day he sent him off,

18:06.840 --> 18:10.322
the young boy disappeared.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.365
Then Pedro or whatever
the hell his name was--

18:13.600 --> 18:15.204
Pedro had looked after
the horses--

18:15.480 --> 18:16.766
he disappeared.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.651
Briggs had a lotto lose
in this thing,

18:19.880 --> 18:22.565
and I've had
that gut feeling for years

18:22.800 --> 18:25.565
that everything starts
and ends right here.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.245
Right here.

18:27.480 --> 18:30.563
Now, them two young boys liked
to ride horses

18:30.800 --> 18:32.643
and have a good time together,
and they played--

18:32.920 --> 18:34.365
they played a little grab-ass

18:34.600 --> 18:36.090
or whatever goes
on between them.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.924
That's their business.
It's none of mine.

18:38.160 --> 18:42.131
These were young boys.
They're human beings.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.091
They deserve the protection
of the law.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.086
That's the way I feel about it,
and that's the way I see it.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.723
But I had a couple of beers
one time with Scott Briggs,

18:53.960 --> 18:56.167
and he told me
that all gays were evil.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.523
S0 that's something
to think about.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.764
Well, Sam, you're gonna
have to use old-fashioned

19:03.000 --> 19:05.287
investigative techniques
on this one.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.491
Really turn up
the heat on this.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.200
But remember,
don't ever forget the obvious,

19:12.440 --> 19:16.126
'cause those clues will lead you
where you need to be.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.648
♪ Last night I slept
on a whorehouse floor... <i>I</i>

19:19.920 --> 19:23.561
290, 290.
Good to see you, sheriff.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.649
Enjoy. Enjoy.)'-

19:25.880 --> 19:27.723
Thanks for the good work.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.681
You got a really good man here.
Yeah. Thank you.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.206
Hey, kids.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.127
Scott?

19:42.400 --> 19:43.970
The kid is gone.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.925
Those guys came back
and took him back to Mexico,

19:47.200 --> 19:50.602
and I couldn't do
anything about it.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.481
You stay up
with Buster tonight, okay?

19:54.720 --> 19:56.961
- I'll take care of it, okay?
- Okay.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.090
I'll take care of it,
all right?

20:00.320 --> 20:02.448
I'll take care of it.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.404
Yeah.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.806
Yeah.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.011
They took the kid back,
and now they're trying

20:14.240 --> 20:15.401
to smuggle drugs over here.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.325
Those dirty sons of bitches.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.121
You hear what I'm saying?!

20:47.480 --> 20:51.451
Good shot. Good shot.
Good shot.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.849
Let's get out of here.
Terrific.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.402
Great. Great.
Great. Great.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.367
- Mrs. Payne.
- Hello, Mrs. Davis.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.409
- How are you?
- Fine. Thank you.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.722
- I would like to show you my son's bedroom.
- Sure.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.764
Mrs. Davis:
His room seems more quiet

21:26.000 --> 21:27.764
than the rest of the house.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.081
I sometimes--

21:29.320 --> 21:32.244
I like to sit down

21:32.480 --> 21:36.804
and...
think about the good times.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.441
Your son seemed
to love water and horses.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.806
Mrs. Davis:
He loved to swim,

21:41.040 --> 21:44.123
but the horses
were everything to him.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.562
How often did he visit
the Briggs ranch?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.490
I really don't know.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.803
What kind of relationship
did he have with Ben Briggs?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.651
- They were very close.
- Mm-hmm.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.002
But...

22:01.240 --> 22:05.928
some people liked to say
it was more than that.

22:06.160 --> 22:10.085
Was your son on antidepressant
medication?

22:10.320 --> 22:12.721
Yes.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.122
He was.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.284
Did he try to commit suicide
prior to his disappearance?

22:24.120 --> 22:25.201
Yes.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.085
Do you mind
if I keep this picture?

22:45.320 --> 22:46.970
- Take anything you need.
- Thank you very much.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.724
<i>Okay</i> Okay.
<i>Okay</i> Okay.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.088
S0 I'll call you as soon
as I learn something.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.563
- Thank you very much. You're so kind.
- Thank you.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.208
Good morning.
ls Mr. Briggs in?

23:13.440 --> 23:15.010
Good morning:
He'll be over in a minute.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.362
- How can I help you?
- Are you the lady of the house?

23:17.600 --> 23:20.604
No, I live with the family.
I have for years.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.729
I help run things
around here.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.923
Well, there's a lotto do
on a ranch this size.

23:25.160 --> 23:29.131
- That's for sure.
- Maria, can I talk to you?

23:29.360 --> 23:31.044
How you doing today?
Good?

23:31.280 --> 23:32.520
Good morning, sir.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.770
- My granddaughter Maddie.
- How are you?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.286
She can ride a horse,
let me tell you.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.722
Okay, go tell your brother,
I need him here

23:39.960 --> 23:41.644
to do some work for one time,
okay, for once.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.211
Kind of early, aren't you?

23:43.480 --> 23:45.209
Nothing's too early
for me, sir.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.323
No, I mean,
the cook-offs in two weeks.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.485
- Well, that can wait.
- Mm-hmm, well, what is it you came for?

23:51.720 --> 23:53.768
I came to ask you about a man
that once worked here,

23:54.000 --> 23:55.331
Pedro Alvarez.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.528
I believe he used
to take care of your horses.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.003
He did. He did.
What's it to you?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.129
Well, it could
possibly mean a lot.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.691
We reopened a case
of a young man

24:04.960 --> 24:07.850
who disappeared 15 years ago,
Jimmy Davis.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.651
Jimmy Davis.
Jimmy Davis.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.446
How come I knew that as soon
as I heard a knock on the door?

24:13.720 --> 24:16.530
I have no idea, sir.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.290
Okay.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.767
Good luck with your procedures,
but in the meantime,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.606
I don't want anybody,
you know...

24:23.840 --> 24:26.241
snooping around my property
asking questions

24:26.520 --> 24:28.010
because this is
private property.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.322
- I hope you understand that.
- I understand that.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.040
And I respect your privacy.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.369
Perhaps we can have a more
formal meeting in the future.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.285
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.090
Thank you.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.770
Man: So what do you want me
to do about it?

24:55.000 --> 24:58.129
Keep track of everything
she does.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.840
What is "everything"?

25:01.080 --> 25:04.129
"Everything"
means everything.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.806
Just keep her off her game,
whatever it takes.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.202
Within reason, okay?

25:12.480 --> 25:14.608
- All right.
- We'll talk later.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.046
All right.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.600
Asshole.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.842
Grandpa!

25:26.120 --> 25:27.531
Grandpa!

25:30.320 --> 25:33.051
Come on, Buster.
Let's go. Come on, buddy.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.930
Yeah!

25:35.160 --> 25:38.243
Thanks, man, for taking my kids
to my wife's house.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.005
- Appreciate it.
- Maddie, Maddie.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.244
I'll make some bunk beds.
You can stay forever.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.761
- Give me a hug.
- Bye, grandpa.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.241
- Love you.
- Love you too.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.806
Okay.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.327
Johnny have the horses ready.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.608
Let me kiss you.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.922
Tell your mom I love her, okay?
We'll be back together soon.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.565
All right?

26:09.680 --> 26:11.364
You, you be good.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.447
Hey, Grandpa,
I'm a Texas Ranger.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.489
If you don't let me
take over your ranch,

26:17.760 --> 26:19.125
I'll arrest
your bow-legged ass.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.488
I love you.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.645
That little bastard.
He always get me.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.201
Oh, shit.

26:29.480 --> 26:34.042
Oh, come back soon.
Come back soon, right?

26:34.320 --> 26:36.084
- I'll be damned, bye-bye.
- Bye.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.961
All I've seen is this.
I don't wanna go crazy with it.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.480
I just wanna
scare her out of here.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.926
Chica nuevos.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.680
What am I supposed
to feed my dogs?

26:47.920 --> 26:49.843
Why don't you feed your dog
your tiny dick?

26:50.120 --> 26:52.441
Yeah, man, this interaction
isn't for blood,

26:52.680 --> 26:54.170
or it's not about money.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.209
It's more about...

26:56.440 --> 26:57.566
maybe we get a little pussy.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.002
- Right?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.844
All right, everybody get
a shovel and dig your head

27:02.080 --> 27:03.206
out of the pussy
'cause you can't see straight.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.726
I'm talking to you about this.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.724
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

27:06.960 --> 27:09.281
I'm saying no firearms.
There's gonna be no shooting.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.324
Right?
Just scare her. That's it.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.045
I don't think
you understand, though.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.328
What if she's shot?

27:15.560 --> 27:16.800
That's not gonna be good for
any of us if she gets killed.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.565
This is the Texas Rangers,
all right?

27:18.800 --> 27:20.404
There's gonna be
repercussions for it.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.801
But what if?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.690
If she gets killed,
then I suggest

27:23.920 --> 27:25.729
you get across
the river back to Mexico.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.769
You can go to goddamn China,
wherever you want to.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.883
I’m asking you
you in or are you out?

27:31.720 --> 27:33.563
Are you in or are you out?

27:33.800 --> 27:35.290
I'll find somebody else
like that.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.443
- You in--
- You know what? I'm in.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.125
- All right.
- Okay.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.805
All right.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.405
And you're out.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.444
Okay. Let's go.
We're done.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.925
Scott: Haven't talked
in nine and a half years, okay?

27:50.160 --> 27:52.003
How many you put
in the ground since then?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.686
Only-- only two, huh?
Better than I am.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.161
Listen to me, for once.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.886
Listen to me.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.920
I-- I need--
l need

28:04.200 --> 28:06.043
all right, okay, I need--

28:06.320 --> 28:09.130
yeah,
I need Ben to call Maria.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.328
It's very,
very important, all right?

28:11.560 --> 28:15.167
<i>A'</i>

28:47.320 --> 28:49.288
City boy.
Look who's here.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.488
Coming here to drag us
into the 21 st Century or what?

28:51.720 --> 28:52.846
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

28:53.120 --> 28:54.246
- Good to see you
- Good to see you, too.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.767
Maria, hi.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.525
- Johnny
- Good to see you.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.889
Pop.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.124
Man, boy, good to see you.
Welcome home.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.681
I'm here to see my brothers
and Maria

29:12.920 --> 29:15.082
and take care of that will.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.290
Yeah, well, that's the only way
I could get you to come here.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.562
Through Maria.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.327
Maria knows best.
She's the boss.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.800
Welcome home.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.725
Your-- your room's
is waiting on you, okay?

29:30.800 --> 29:32.723
I remember where it is.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.849
- See you up there.
- See you.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.521
Good to see you, son.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.567
Thank you, Lord Jesus.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.966
Man:
How are you?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.565
Maria:
I'm good, how are you?

29:45.840 --> 29:46.921
Man:
How's the family?

29:46.960 --> 29:48.769
Uh, the family?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.401
Well, you know my mom died
seven years ago.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.809
- Mm-hmm.
- And, well, my father,

29:55.040 --> 29:56.724
he left,
and I never heard from him.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.803
- Mm.
- You know, he vanished.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.007
Yeah.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.851
But you're my family, so.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.004
You look good.
You look very handsome.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.725
Have you been eating well?

30:07.960 --> 30:09.962
Yeah.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.242
I don't know if I'm gonna...

30:12.480 --> 30:14.084
- go eat dinner.
- What?

30:14.320 --> 30:16.482
I'm just gonna stay here,
maybe take a walk.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.051
No.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.770
It's weird.
It's weird.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.611
No, it's not weird,
and supper's ready,

30:22.880 --> 30:25.247
and I'm gonna sit with you,
and everything's gonna be fine.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.244
- You're gonna sit with me?
- Of course.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.244
I'll be next to you.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.403
If you sit next to me,
then I'll go.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.761
Yes.

30:33.000 --> 30:33.967
Yeah?

30:34.160 --> 30:35.810
I missed you so much.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.122
You're the brother
I never had.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.169
Yeah.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.771
I'm lying.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.090
I think I always had
a crush on you.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.486
Oh, really?

30:46.720 --> 30:47.881
Really.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.770
Well, I wish I had known that
earlier.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.844
We could have saved
a lot of problems.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.886
Yeah, I think so.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.128
Let's go.
Come on.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.648
- I'll help you with that later.
- All right.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.889
Hello. Welcome.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.282
Hey, Johnny, how are you doing
out Atlanta all day?

31:11.520 --> 31:12.931
God dang,
I heard a lot about you.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.491
Good to finally meet you.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.081
Everybody sit down.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.651
Known your old daddy a while.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.609
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

31:20.840 --> 31:24.128
I'd just like to say
that I'm very--

31:24.400 --> 31:27.006
I'm very pleased and moved,
I really am,

31:27.280 --> 31:30.489
that my sons, my three sons
the first time in many years

31:30.720 --> 31:31.881
are being here together,

31:32.160 --> 31:34.049
and it makes me very,
very happy.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.561
And very emotional.
Okay?

31:36.800 --> 31:40.202
Benny, I'm so happy
that he's here.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.728
I am very happy.
But are we okay for now?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.002
Are we okay for now?

31:46.240 --> 31:47.651
- Are we okay?
- Yeah. I'm asking you.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.081
Yeah, we're okay, dad.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.209
- Okay, good.
- It's good to be here.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.568
- Yeah.
- It's great to see y'all.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.161
S0 did you meet ID?
He's been my partner.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.686
- All right.
- Ben, good to meet you.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.321
Heard a little bit about you.
- Pretty crappy business partner.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.728
Hadn't earned me a damn cent,
but he's--

32:02.960 --> 32:06.760
I've been saving that for you.
I'm holding it for your boy.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.604
Yay!

32:10.840 --> 32:12.842
I'm not used to saying grace,

32:13.080 --> 32:15.082
but maybe we should say
a little grace.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.646
Maybe somebody
should say some.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.723
KC or...

32:18.960 --> 32:20.689
yeah, you or which.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.003
Come on.
Somebody.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.890
There's no before
and there's no after.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.929
There's only now and love.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.561
S0 let us love each other
like Jesus said.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.207
I love Jesus,
but I like to drink a little.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.329
Let us pray
for our brother Ben.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.086
Give him love
and welcome him home.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.287
Thank you.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.283
And the food, too.
Amen.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.085
- Amen.
- Amen.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.926
Yeah, now
we got a surprise for you.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.571
Okay, I'm ready.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.040
Milo?

32:49.320 --> 32:53.609
Come on.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.564
- Oh, no!
- Good God!

32:56.800 --> 32:57.847
Oh, wow.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.690
Maria:
Oh, my God.

32:59.920 --> 33:00.887
Ben: What do you got there,
Milo?

33:01.040 --> 33:05.011
This was my favorite kid goat.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.526
That was your favorite goat?

33:06.760 --> 33:07.761
What was his named?

33:08.040 --> 33:10.441
His name, uh, is Billy.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.251
- Billy Goat.
- That was Billy.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.766
In honor--

33:15.000 --> 33:17.446
in honor
of Benny's homecoming,

33:17.720 --> 33:21.008
Benny, I cooked him
especially for you.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.607
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, Milo. Can't wait to dig in.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.683
I'm glad you kept
the teeth in that.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.163
Applause for Milo.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.810
<i>A'</i>

33:57.400 --> 33:59.641
- Where you going, Benny? Where you going?
- I'll be back.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.167
- I'll be back. I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

34:02.400 --> 34:05.847
He said he'll be back,
Pop.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.167
- Hola.
- Hey.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.521
Thank you.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.283
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.851
Did you have a good time?

34:22.600 --> 34:24.841
It was all right.

34:25.120 --> 34:28.043
Oh, gosh.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.487
Freak show.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.407
What are you doing?

34:40.679 --> 34:42.808
Dance with me.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.882
No. No.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.884
Your father dances with me.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.804
- What?
- Yeah.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.007
My dad dances with you?

34:50.239 --> 34:51.400
Yeah, like...

34:51.639 --> 34:54.085
No, no, no, no, no.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.761
- Like this?
- Yeah, I swear.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.847
That's my daddy.

35:09.120 --> 35:12.124
Let me dance with you!

35:12.360 --> 35:13.885
I'd rather dance
with my horse!

35:16.280 --> 35:18.248
He's in love with that horse.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.960
Almost love you
as much as my horse, Maria!

36:07.560 --> 36:11.963
I'll never forget it,
and I'll never understand it.

36:12.200 --> 36:16.603
You told me to read the Bible,
and I did.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.650
Leviticus.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.962
Is it worse for two men
to lie together

36:22.240 --> 36:25.528
or for King David
to send a man to battle to die

36:25.760 --> 36:28.331
so that he can lay
with his wife?

36:28.560 --> 36:29.846
What's worse?

36:35.040 --> 36:38.169
Nothing to say?

36:43.520 --> 36:46.330
You always protected yourself
with silence.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.449
I guess you still do.

Samantha:
It turns out that Pedro Alvarez

37:05.680 --> 37:07.967
stays at
Isabel's Convenience Store,

37:08.240 --> 37:10.083
and I really need
to speak with him.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.402
He's Isabel's relative.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.166
I would like to go to Linda Rosa
to meet with them.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.528
Man: Okay, I'll arrange
for Rogers to go with you.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.330
He knows the town well.

37:19.560 --> 37:21.961
- I don't need that clown, sir.
- No, you go with him.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.567
- Yes, sir. Okay.
- Did you get that car for Cody?

37:24.840 --> 37:26.444
Yeah,
I'm driving Cody's new car,

37:26.720 --> 37:28.210
and I think
he's going to like it.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.329
What the hell was that?

37:30.600 --> 37:32.170
I just got shot at,
sir.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.843
Dad...

40:28.080 --> 40:30.651
where's Jimmy?

40:30.880 --> 40:33.645
What happened to him?

40:33.880 --> 40:35.848
I have no idea whatsoever.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.851
- He's around, huh?
- Absolutely.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.646
I'm only concerned about you
and the rest of us,

40:41.880 --> 40:43.291
- the family, that's it.
- The family?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.443
Yeah, what there is of it,
yeah.

40:48.400 --> 40:52.610
I've been going a little
downhill since you left.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.405
I feel better now.

41:00.280 --> 41:03.489
I think back
to this particular time...

41:06.000 --> 41:08.606
when I got bucked off a horse,
and you told me to get back on,

41:08.840 --> 41:11.446
and...

41:11.680 --> 41:14.763
you did it in such
a kind way, I...

41:15.000 --> 41:16.490
I just like TO Think about I'!

41:16.720 --> 41:21.044
'Cause it kind of offsets
what happened.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.124
It's not enough
to make me forget,

41:24.360 --> 41:26.362
but it helps a little bit.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.604
Yeah.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.723
Thank you, son.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.367
Come in, fellas.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.806
<i>Okay.</i>

41:49.040 --> 41:50.166
Special day.
special day.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.970
- Yeah.
-Sony

41:54.240 --> 41:55.241
Have a seat.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.245
Maria,
come over here.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.486
Over here.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.326
You're late.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.721
You're always late.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.331
Sorry.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.607
Yeah. Okay.

42:10.880 --> 42:14.327
There you go, darlin'.

42:14.560 --> 42:17.370
- Your dad wanted me to go over a few things--
- Hold on.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.682
How come we're here like this?

42:19.920 --> 42:23.641
A will is a totally
private family thing, right?

42:23.880 --> 42:26.121
- Private?
- That's what I was about to explain to you,

42:26.360 --> 42:27.930
if you'd just
give me a second.

42:30.840 --> 42:34.208
Okay, go ahead.

42:34.480 --> 42:37.245
Your dad wanted everybody
here together as family

42:37.480 --> 42:39.960
because he wanted the entire
family to understand everything.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.129
He wanted-- he wanted it
all out in the open.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.806
- Is that right, Scott?
- Yes, sir.

42:45.080 --> 42:49.130
S0 we've laid out
a very simple plan.

42:49.360 --> 42:53.126
Basically, the 40,000 acres
be broken up equally

42:53.360 --> 42:54.691
in four ways.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.371
What are you talking about,
four ways?

42:56.600 --> 42:58.887
Pop.
Hold on a second here.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.851
No, no, no, no.
Let him finish, all right?

43:02.080 --> 43:04.970
Go head, John.
Let him finish.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.567
Your dad's laid it out
in very simple terms,

43:07.800 --> 43:09.723
laid it out very nicely.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.406
10,000 acres
to each of the boys,

43:12.640 --> 43:16.690
10,000 acres and the ranch house
to Maria Anna Gonzalez.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.809
<i>Uaughs) Pop, Pop--</i>

43:19.040 --> 43:20.849
Scott:
I know what you're gonna say.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.242
Right, Maria's not
a part of this family.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.970
- Not really.
- Maria: I know.

43:25.240 --> 43:26.651
- Right, Maria?
- I know.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.120
- This is a family deal here.
- I know.

43:28.360 --> 43:30.442
I love Maria,
you know we all do,

43:30.680 --> 43:32.921
- like a sister, but, Dad--
- Hold on a minute.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.401
As I said before,

43:35.640 --> 43:39.167
this is probably
the happiest day of my life

43:39.400 --> 43:42.244
as well as the toughest.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.086
I'd like to say she's
not just like a sister to you.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.211
Excuse me.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.411
She is your sister.

43:58.360 --> 44:00.010
Jesus.

44:00.280 --> 44:02.806
And a daughter
that I care for and love

44:03.040 --> 44:04.724
maybe more than anyone.

44:04.960 --> 44:06.166
I want you all to know that.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.323
All right?

44:13.360 --> 44:14.566
Maria?

44:16.920 --> 44:19.366
Explain yourself.

44:19.600 --> 44:23.002
I can't right now.
I can't.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.527
Any further questions
at the moment,

44:25.800 --> 44:28.167
you can ask John.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.606
I have to...

44:35.560 --> 44:37.369
get some fresh air.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.646
We can talk later, Maria,
if you'd like.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.201
But, uh...

44:47.440 --> 44:51.843
in the meantime,
I want you all to remember this.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.770
This is your sister.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.928
She's blood now.

44:58.160 --> 45:01.881
<i>K door opens 3</i>

45:07.480 --> 45:08.891
Well.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.690
Maria.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.526
Welcome to the family.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.967
Come here.
Come here.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.966
Come here.
Come here.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.403
- Come here.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.646
I'm just glad I'm gay,

45:32.880 --> 45:34.484
otherwise I would've
married my sister.

46:00.800 --> 46:03.326
She still in there?

46:03.560 --> 46:05.005
Of course
she's still in there.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.248
She's waiting.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.927
She-- she didn't go out
the other door?

46:13.280 --> 46:16.124
Hey, Pop.
This is the only door.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.169
Okay.

46:18.400 --> 46:22.564
Yeah. All right.
I guess I better go back in.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.889
Think I should?

46:26.120 --> 46:28.521
Yeah, I think so.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.371
All right. Okay.

46:39.120 --> 46:42.522
Well, looks like we got
us a beautiful Mexican sister

46:42.760 --> 46:44.000
and a homosexual brother.

46:44.240 --> 46:46.766
You call it "gay," Johnny.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.571
I don't know about that.

46:54.880 --> 46:56.530
We'll figure it out.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.481
Hey)'-

47:10.480 --> 47:12.562
If you hadn't given her
10,000 acres,

47:12.840 --> 47:16.322
I would have given her mine,
and I still might.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.124
I don't understand.

47:32.240 --> 47:33.810
Why was I always treated
like a daughter,

47:34.040 --> 47:35.326
but never told
I was a daughter?

47:35.560 --> 47:37.562
That's beyond me.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.848
Yeah,
I know it makes sense to you,

47:40.120 --> 47:41.565
but certainly not to me.

47:46.400 --> 47:50.291
And who was Tomas?
Just a make-believe father?

47:50.520 --> 47:54.445
Maybe he ran off,
left your mother.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.085
I wonder why.

48:03.640 --> 48:04.846
S0 why are you telling me now?

48:05.080 --> 48:06.525
Why what?

48:06.760 --> 48:09.809
Why didn't you tell me
long before this?

48:10.040 --> 48:11.326
Were you ashamed?

48:11.560 --> 48:14.769
Why would I be ashamed?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.206
You're my daughter.

48:18.600 --> 48:19.601
I don't know.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.365
You seem to have
all the answers.

48:21.600 --> 48:25.571
Are you ashamed
because I am the product

48:25.800 --> 48:28.804
of your unwed Mexican maid?

48:29.040 --> 48:30.769
Might that have
something to do with--

48:31.000 --> 48:34.402
Listen-- no listen to me.
I loved your mother. I did.

48:34.680 --> 48:36.489
You didn't answer my question.

48:36.760 --> 48:39.730
It didn't look right

48:39.960 --> 48:42.201
in this particular
community of yours.

48:42.480 --> 48:43.561
Is that it?

48:45.640 --> 48:47.529
Maybe.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.808
There doesn't seem
to be a maybe here.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.122
Yes or no.

48:56.080 --> 48:57.889
Yes or no.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.766
Hey, I'm a coward.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.088
Oh, yes, you are.

49:03.320 --> 49:06.164
Don't play the victim
on me here now.

49:06.400 --> 49:09.244
It's too late for that.

49:09.480 --> 49:14.168
Well, I hope someday
that I can be forgiven.

49:14.400 --> 49:17.324
Oh, please.
Don't do that.

49:19.640 --> 49:22.291
If I ever decide
to forgive anybody,

49:22.560 --> 49:26.087
it would be me who decides,
not you.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.766
This one time,
my dear father,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.446
you can't decide.

49:31.680 --> 49:32.966
I won't let you.

49:39.760 --> 49:41.205
Go home and rest.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.249
I'm sure you need it.
I have things to do.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.848
Is that like-- is that like
a southern turn-on?

50:06.040 --> 50:08.725
Did we ever play
smear the queer with you?

50:08.960 --> 50:10.246
- What--
- Did we?

50:10.520 --> 50:12.841
What the eff
is smear the queer?

50:13.080 --> 50:15.526
- Smear the queer, man.
- What is that game? Tell me about that game.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.922
Cow patty on your face
with a bamboo stick.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.282
Actually, you know what?
I think you did.

50:20.520 --> 50:23.444
- And that's why I turned gay.
- I think that's probably why.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.011
I think you turned me gay,
brother.

50:25.240 --> 50:26.810
- No way.
- Yeah.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.650
Thank you.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.127
- He says gay. How do you call it?
- Yeah.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.203
I say why can't
you just say "homosexual"?

50:33.440 --> 50:35.169
Sometimes,
we pronounce it "g'ay."

50:35.400 --> 50:37.084
G'ay?
That's like you're choking?

50:37.320 --> 50:39.448
What is that?
G'ay?

50:39.720 --> 50:41.722
You lost it.
You drank way too much, Johnny.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.883
Johnny,
ignorant son of a bitch.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.681
- Just shut your trap. Shut your trap.
- I wanna know!

50:47.920 --> 50:49.968
What do you wanna know?
Tell me what you wanna know.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.009
Who gets on top first?

50:52.240 --> 50:54.368
- What?
- Who swings the bat?

50:54.600 --> 50:56.170
- No, I'll lay it out.
- Oh, Jesus.

50:56.440 --> 50:58.124
- Who gets on top first?
- Yeah.

50:58.400 --> 51:01.563
Well, we flip a coin.
That's how we do it.

51:01.800 --> 51:02.926
Sometimes, Rochambeau.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.804
- Rochambeau?
- Rochambeau.

51:05.080 --> 51:08.402
- What does that mean?
- Paper, rock, scissors.

51:08.640 --> 51:10.483
"I'm a dumb
redneck heterosexual."

51:10.720 --> 51:13.769
What's the dirtiest,
wildest sex you ever had?

51:14.040 --> 51:16.486
Shit.

51:16.760 --> 51:18.205
Johnny, stop.
Stop!

51:18.440 --> 51:20.363
Hey,
knock it off over there.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.768
It's not a library, man!

51:25.000 --> 51:27.241
- All right, come on.
- Shut up!

51:27.520 --> 51:29.249
- Or you come over here and I'll kick your ass.
- Let's get out of here.

51:29.520 --> 51:31.966
Come on. Come on.
Come on, Johnny.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.205
All right, all right.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.880
Hey,
stick it up your ass, pal!

51:42.160 --> 51:43.446
Ben:
Hey, he didn't mean it.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.170
- You!
- Come on, come on.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.682
Hey, hey, hey,
you all right?

51:50.960 --> 51:54.362
- Take a couple of deep breaths. Walk it off.
- Come here, come here.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.967
Fresh air.
Getting excited.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.123
Hey, jackass.
You want a piece of me?

51:59.360 --> 52:01.044
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah?

52:01.280 --> 52:03.408
- Yeah.
- I'm not talking to you, asshole.

52:03.680 --> 52:05.523
- Yeah, you're talking to me.
- Who's the asshole?

52:05.800 --> 52:07.609
I got this. I got this.
I got this.

52:07.840 --> 52:10.127
- Back off, man, I'm not talking to you, little faggot.
- What?

52:22.200 --> 52:24.601
- Who's the faggot now, huh?!
- Yeah, get out of here!

52:24.840 --> 52:27.320
- Get out of here!
- Come on.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.881
Ben:
Get the fuck out of here.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.969
That was awesome!
You're starting trouble, man!

52:43.600 --> 52:46.080
Awesome.
You were a buzz saw in there.

52:46.320 --> 52:48.482
- Thank you, sir.
- Papa's right.

52:48.760 --> 52:51.081
You must have been a hell
of a street fighter

52:51.320 --> 52:52.321
when you were younger.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.045
Yeah, pop taught me
a thing or two.

52:54.280 --> 52:55.691
I was a little off my game.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.604
I got bumped into something,
but how'd I do?

52:57.840 --> 52:59.763
Oh, you were an animal.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.923
You weren't worth a shit
even though you started it.

53:02.160 --> 53:05.562
- Come on, man!
- You weren't worth shit!

53:05.800 --> 53:07.325
I thought I got someone.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.131
You remind me of pop
a little bit sometimes.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.691
How's that?

53:11.920 --> 53:14.207
I was told when my pop
was a young man,

53:14.440 --> 53:16.169
he'd got in a fight
with the sheriff

53:16.400 --> 53:18.846
and knocked that guy on his ass
in front of a bunch of people

53:19.080 --> 53:20.605
on account of a guy
called him a draft dodger

53:20.880 --> 53:22.086
during the Korean War.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.129
Guy never mentioned anything
to pops again.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.966
- Never said shit.
- I believe that.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.725
Chip off the old block,
both of you.

53:28.960 --> 53:30.485
- What happened to you?
- I don't know, man.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.130
- A lover of all things.
- A gentle heterosexual.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.249
Straight.
Straight.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.410
- Go, go, go, go.
- Go get him, Cody!

53:40.640 --> 53:42.449
Get him, boy!

53:51.600 --> 53:54.490
- All right.
- Way to go, Cody.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.961
Good job.

53:57.200 --> 54:00.409
Good roping today.
Your dad would be proud.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.642
S0 how come you never
talk about your father?

54:02.920 --> 54:05.287
Every time his name comes up,
you change the subject.

54:05.520 --> 54:07.249
Why?

54:07.480 --> 54:09.926
Because he was
a very violent man,

54:10.160 --> 54:12.640
and at the same time,
I love him very much.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.211
What do you mean?

54:14.440 --> 54:16.602
What do I mean?

54:16.840 --> 54:19.491
Hmm.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.010
Well,
last time I saw him,

54:24.280 --> 54:28.046
he came storming
into the kitchen like a maniac,

54:28.320 --> 54:32.120
and you never knew
what set him off...

54:32.360 --> 54:36.490
and as violent as you can
imagine a man can be.

54:36.720 --> 54:38.802
And...

54:39.080 --> 54:41.367
you can only see his hand...

54:41.600 --> 54:45.446
going to my throat,
and then you feel the wall.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.729
And I was just so tired
of being afraid,

54:48.960 --> 54:52.248
so tired that I decided that

54:52.480 --> 54:53.811
that was going to be it.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.930
S0 I stare at him.

55:06.360 --> 55:07.600
And I said,
"Well, go for it."

55:09.840 --> 55:12.207
I said, "Go for it."

55:12.440 --> 55:15.330
And you can see his fist
going by my face

55:15.560 --> 55:17.050
and hitting the wall.

55:19.160 --> 55:23.484
And I opened my eyes,
and I stare at him,

55:23.720 --> 55:26.405
and he looked like a...
demon,

55:26.640 --> 55:28.051
and, um--

55:28.280 --> 55:30.965
and he just walk away.

55:31.200 --> 55:32.850
And that was it.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.051
We're set.
You ready?

55:37.280 --> 55:38.247
Yeah.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.010
Let's go.

55:40.240 --> 55:41.526
Give me a hug.

55:41.760 --> 55:44.650
Oh, I love you so much.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.006
S0 much.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.286
Lock the doors.

56:39.800 --> 56:42.963
We're closed,
but how can I help you?

56:43.200 --> 56:44.247
Hello, Mrs. Isabel?

56:44.480 --> 56:45.561
Yes?

56:45.800 --> 56:47.643
Hi, I'm looking
for Eduardo Valdez.

56:47.920 --> 56:49.206
And who wants to know?

56:49.440 --> 56:50.805
We do,
the Texas Rangers.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.850
Well, he's not here.
He comes and goes.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.320
Oh, I see.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.050
Should I tell him that
you are looking for him?

56:57.280 --> 56:59.567
Yes, please.
I just left my business card.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.564
If he can call me
whenever he has a chance,

57:01.800 --> 57:03.609
- I will really appreciate it.
- I'll do that.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.330
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Have a good night.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.965
- You're welcome, good night.
- Good night.

57:07.200 --> 57:09.089
Be careful out there,
it's kinda dangerous.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.522
- Yeah, take care yourself. Bye.
- Thank you.

57:13.480 --> 57:15.289
I went to Joe's Bar.

57:15.520 --> 57:18.364
Bartender told me there was
a  in town,

57:18.600 --> 57:20.967
a new guy,
so I followed him out,

57:21.240 --> 57:22.605
pulled him over.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.604
That's not bad
for a new guy.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.808
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57:27.080 --> 57:29.651
- Looks great.
- Squeezing on it like it's a pair of titties

57:29.920 --> 57:31.968
ain't gonna get you
any closer to getting a job.

57:32.200 --> 57:33.929
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.527
- Listen, man--
- Hey, man. Hey, man--

59:10.760 --> 59:11.841
We talk about business here.

59:12.080 --> 59:13.809
This stuff in your hand
has no value.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.087
No value?

59:15.360 --> 59:16.885
Why are you here
if it has no value?

59:17.120 --> 59:18.326
Man:
How are we gonna sell that?

59:18.560 --> 59:20.005
Man:
Let me make a point to you.

59:20.280 --> 59:22.521
You're fighting
for 70% of this, yeah?

59:22.760 --> 59:27.084
You want 70% of zero,
nothing, nada?

59:27.320 --> 59:29.687
Or you want 60% of this?
It's your call.

59:29.960 --> 59:32.167
What do you want?

59:32.400 --> 59:35.324
I want 40% instead of 30.
I'm not doing 30.

59:35.560 --> 59:38.484
No way, man.
No way, asshole.

59:38.760 --> 59:40.000
Hey, we can talk.

59:40.240 --> 59:41.969
You don't have to call me
an asshole.

59:42.200 --> 59:44.601
Call me asshole again, I'm gonna
slap you in the goddamn mouth.

59:44.840 --> 59:46.444
- Just give it a try.
- Just talk.

59:46.720 --> 59:49.166
You want to do business,
to business, but just talk.

59:49.400 --> 59:52.165
- You need me to sell stuff.
- I don't need you. I need somebody to sell stuff.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.805
You think I can't get
somebody else,

59:54.040 --> 59:55.644
you're wrong, my friend,
you're wrong about that.

59:55.880 --> 59:57.325
- Mm-hmm.
- 40.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.882
All right.
Let's do the deal, asshole.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.965
That comes out your end.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.964
Look my face of concern.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.204
Look your face of concern.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.204
- All right.
- Look my face of celebration.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.647
- All right. Good.
- Yeah, 40. Deal.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.008
Man:
Hey, Sheriff, what's your 20?

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.890
Man:
67 and 11.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.690
Man:  Okay, good.
You're right behind me.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.604
Listen,
I got a text from Sam.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.205
It was real vague,
but apparently,

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.130
she stumbled on a drug deal
going down

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.846
at that warehouse
in Minarosa.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.730
You gotta know this--

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.521
your Deputy Rogers
is inside that building.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.966
Man:
10-4

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.610
Here you go.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.007
You got a girl?

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.571
Man: No.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.087
You seem sad about it.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.049
- It's not our business, man.
- Huh?

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.930
- That's not our business.
- You want to talk business,

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.969
let's talk about the $1,000
you owe me that I paid you

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.565
to scare a Ranger
and nothing happened.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.649
- What? What? What?
- What do you want?

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.326
Want a refund or a credit store
or something?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.011
- Who?
- A store credit.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.208
- In English. What's that?
- A store credit.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.608
- Store credit?
- Yeah. How about that?

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.604
That's business,
what you want to talk about.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.446
All right, man,
take from the cut.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.809
- All right? No worries.
- No worries.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.726
It's a good thing for you
and me both

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.042
- that kid got killed, too.
- I know.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.566
You'd be in prison--

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.084
- Let me see your hands.
- Down, down, down, down!

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.845
- Hands behind your back.
- Don't move.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.923
Y'all got here two seconds later
I don't know what.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.400
Asshole.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.847
Yesterday, you were teaching
these kids about drugs,

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.366
and now you're
doing this shit?

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.880
Si!

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.688
I don't know who you're
working for, asshole,

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.729
but you're a disgrace
to our profession.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.564
- You understand?
- Answer him.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.088
- Yes, sir!
- Get your ass up.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.124
Get this crap up around here.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.850
Come here. Sit up.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.809
Sit up.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.611
I'll say it again.
There's no Pedro Alvarez.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.171
I'd hit the road
if I were you.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.164
Whatever you say, bud.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.368
Thank you, Mrs. Isabel.
Thank you for helping us.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.329
Oh, you're welcome.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.728
The one that lived in Mexico
and now you live here?

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.809
Back and forth.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.123
I'm with the Texas Rangers,
Mr. Alvarez.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.006
And I came to ask you
about Ben and Scott Briggs.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.726
Do you know what happened
to Jimmy Davis

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.764
who took care of
Briggs' horses?

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.886
In my pueblo,

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.169
there is little--
this little tiny bird

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.971
that is brilliant red--

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.771
rojo, rojo"

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.209
red with little black wings.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.086
He flies up
and down the canyon.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.569
And what does he do
all day long?

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.402
He lives to catch flies.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.128
Can you help us?

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.527
I am very sorry
it didn't work out.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.569
I'm sorry.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.961
Man:
Don't feel bad.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.730
This generation of Mexicans
hate the Texas Rangers.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.042
I know.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.561
Hello, Mr. Scott.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.764
The Texas Ranger Samantha Payne
is waiting in your office.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.411
Oh...

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.206
Well, just open the floodgates,
you idiot.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.851
Open the floodgates!

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.041
Please be seated.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.249
What can I do for you?

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.450
I came to ask you
about Jimmy Davis.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.648
Jimmy Davis?
What about him?

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.446
Did you know that your son
and Jimmy Davis had an affair?

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.162
No, no, that never happened.
That's just small-town rumors.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.611
That confirms
that they did have an affair.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.444
$0?

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.604
I believe his disappearance
was a hate crime.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.046
A hate crime?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:00.008
How long you been doing
your job, young lady?

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.964
Because you have a picture
of a man who is missing,

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.811
you come to the simple
conclusion that me

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.286
or anyone out here
had anything to do

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.249
with this man's disappearance.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.565
You can't go and start arresting
people anywhere you look.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.968
I mean,
everybody has someone to hate.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.931
I have someone.
You have someone.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.370
And let me tell you something.
The Mexicans hate the blacks.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.645
The blacks hate the white.
My white neighbor hates women.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.281
And my liberal lawyer hates
my Republican friends,

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.167
and my Republican friends hate
my liberal lawyer.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.011
But the work gets done.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.641
Do you have anything to do with
Jimmy Davis' disappearance, sir?

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.488
I have never done
anything to that man,

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.611
and if you think I have,
then what can I say?

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.729
I understand
you have made comments

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.527
that you do believe
that gay people are evil.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.849
Those are strong feelings
of hate, Mr. Briggs,

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.764
and hate can bring confusion
to a man

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.765
that wants to control everything
and everyone around him.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.527
I believe in justice
just like everyone else.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.886
Do you, Mr. Briggs?

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.327
Yes, I do.
Now please leave my office.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.884
I met with Pedro Alvarez.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.520
Pedro Alvarez.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.285
Pedro Alvarez.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.930
And what did he say?

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.166
He said plenty.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.720
He said what?

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.849
Who lets the Texas Rangers
onto my property?!

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.890
Who does that?
My goddamn cook!

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.282
He not only cooks the soup
and my fried chicken

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.363
and lets anybody onto
my property that he wants me to!

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.448
I don't get it!
I don't get it!

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.964
You know, they arrested
that Rogers guy in a drug bust.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.281
They what?

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.040
Yeah,
they got him in custody.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:59.170
- They got him.
- Okay, now, you listen to me and listen good.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:01.249
I don't want some
cheap Texas Ranger bitch

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:04.051
roaming around this property
asking a bunch of questions.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.287
I don't want her on this
property or anywhere near!

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.683
You hear me?! Nowhere!
If she does, only I talk to her!

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.082
You understand?
Only me! Only me!

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.560
Where's Ben?
He's never around here.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.211
- Where's Ben?
- She's just doing her job.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:18.090
What are you getting
so worked up for?

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.162
- Give her a pass.
- Give her a pass?

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.243
For what,
you friggin' retard?

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:24.482
You friggin' retard!
Give her a pass.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.966
Who's the retard?

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.804
We invited her
to the barbecue next week.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.167
- Who invited?
- Not me, old man, not me.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.288
- You did.
- Then uninvite her.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.642
Get her on the phone
this goddamn minute

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.848
and uninvite
that sneaking bitch!

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.729
- You hear me?
- No way.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.087
- What do you mean no way?
- No way, you do it.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:45.331
Oh, I do what you--
oh, you thimble-headed redneck

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.767
son of a bitch.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.082
Yeah? Yeah?
Step up!

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:53.049
Now, listen to me--
I don't want that bitch

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.884
anywhere around me,
you understand me?

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.286
Nowhere around me.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.285
Now...

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.000
clean all this shit up,
clean it up before supper.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.129
Clean it up yourself,
you asshole.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.921
Kiss my ass 27 times,
you prick.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.801
Speak up, Johnny.
You never say anything.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.201
Get out of my way.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.648
Don't you pick it up.
Don't you pick it up.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.922
Samantha: I wanna ask you
about Jimmy Davis.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.561
Sure.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.245
What do you want to know?

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.687
You were having an affair
with Jimmy Davis.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.848
Well,
that's nobody's business.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.084
I'm not here to judge you,
Mr. Briggs.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.481
Mm-hmm.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.285
I'm sure it was
very difficult for you

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.166
to be a gay man in a town
of machos like the one we're in.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.569
It's like you'd expect.
I pretended to be straight.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.040
Uh-huh.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.368
I made sure to date
the prettiest girls.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.046
I was the one to always
start the fights

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.288
- so no one’s starting with me.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.206
Just pray to be like
everyone wanted me to be.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.842
How'd your father react
when he learned you were guy?

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.170
My father is a tough guy.
and you can't tell him anything.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.688
But my mother...

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.327
she told me
to go live my life.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.769
Some people,
they'll never accept it.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.286
That's true.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.363
That's true.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.486
Was anybody with you and Jimmy
the last time you saw him?

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.609
The last time I saw him?

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.922
- Yeah, was anybody with you?
- No.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.321
- No?
- No.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.970
Do you believe that blood
runs thicker than truth, sir?

01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.081
No. I don't know why you're
asking me that, but no.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.685
It's okay.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.042
I found this.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.924
Anybody out there?

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.850
Who's hungry?

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.446
She's got me.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.162
Red:
Knock, knock.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.845
Who's there?

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.570
Red.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.804
Red? Red Who?

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.443
Your redneck prick
son of a bitch son, that's who.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.527
What do you want smashed
before you pick it up, huh?

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.728
- You want this?
- Pick your spot, pick your spot.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.487
Yeah.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.520
I missed you guys at supper.
Where's Johnny at?

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.410
Johnny's getting divorced,
Pop.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.723
Tell him not to worry.
It's not the end of the world.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.008
Probably best not
to tell him anything.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.891
No, you're right,
you're right.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.841
S0 this whole little court
chitchat gets caught up, okay?

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.606
- I gotta get going.
- What do you mean? You just got here.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.842
I'll see you in the morning.
We can bust up more shit.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.650
- Who's gonna clean it up?
- You are?

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.360
- Me? Oh, bullshit.
- Walk me to the door.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.126
All right.
Hold on, hold on.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.084
Oh, yeah,
I wanna ask you,

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.250
things with Sandy
are better, I hope.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.209
Better. Thanks.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.841
Yeah. Good girl.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.963
Don't let her go, son.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.043
She's too good,
tell you that.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.282
- She's great.
- Yeah.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.010
I finally cut off
that other deal.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.971
I gotta stay
at what's right for me.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.521
Can't let it be said
that the apple or whatever

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.245
doesn't fall far
from the tree.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.122
Yeah, right, hey, hey,
hey, hey, get out of here.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.647
- Right.
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.847
Right.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.610
One other thing.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.161
They're coming after me again.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.090
Yeah, I know.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.842
- You hang in there, Pop.
- Okay.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.926
All right.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.564
Looking good.
Looking good.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.086
Where's Johnny at?

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.561
He told me
to saddle your horse.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.484
Just warming him up for you.
I hope you don't mind.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.007
- Why would I mind?
- Okay.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.720
Hadn't lost
too much there, son.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.440
Good. Yeah.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.251
Getting long
in the tooth here, so.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.962
Need all the help,
I can get.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.607
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you, darlin'.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.765
Whoa. Whoa. Yeah.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.328
Once I'm up here...

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.483
I feel a lot better
than I do down on the ground,

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.161
that's for damn sure.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.688
You know, you never answered
my question about what happened.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.170
Of course I did.
You just don't listen.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.771
I have no idea.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.725
S0 he just disappeared.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.849
Seems kind of impossible,
don't you think?

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.687
I been over this
a thousand times.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.689
How many teen suicides
do you think there are

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.922
yearly in America,
let alone Texas?

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.680
- I don't know.
- Well, look it up on your Google deal.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.644
Lake Brownwood
or any of these other lakes

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.048
throughout the state?

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.727
All right?
Just chalk another one up.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.930
That's all you have to say.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.845
Well, what else is there?

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.560
You know...

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.926
I missed you, Dad.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.608
Even if I don't understand you,
and I'd like to know you better.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.444
But I guess both
of our hearts are closed.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.047
Maybe that's the problem.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.890
Maybe.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.881
And I guess you'll never accept
that I'm gay.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.289
Benny, Ben boy, I-- I--

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.568
I mean...

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.362
why you do what you do,
whatever you do,

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.602
but I'm working on it,
son.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.928
You are?
Then why don't you listen to me?

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.491
Why don't you put yourself
in my shoes?

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.489
We'll switch roles
for a minute.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.411
- Why would I do that?
- I tell you why.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.409
What do you think happens
between two men?

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.569
What do you think we do
when we're in private?

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.408
I'm not so sure I want to know.
It makes no sense to me, son.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.086
Well, I can explain it to you.
I can tell you.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.169
I can tell you
exactly what happens.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.930
Want to hear?

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.248
I'm not talking about
slow dancing and honky-tonk.

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.721
I'm talking about what happens
in the wee hours.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.450
Want me to tell you?

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.650
I don't think so.
We could wait until another day.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.450
- All right?
- All right.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.206
Well, you can think about
or you cannot think about it,

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.726
but that's the situation.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.445
That's what's going on.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.921
15 years ago
is the same as today.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.162
S0 you can put another gun
to my head and say,

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.528
"Get the fuck
off the Briggs ranch,"

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.043
or you can be a real man
and accept what's going on.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.721
You just think about it.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.923
Another thing--
congratulations.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.404
"Love" was a non-existent word
on this ranch.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.005
And I heard you use it
the other day

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.009
when you were expressing
yourself to Maria.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.807
I'd never heard you utter
that word once,

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.404
not even to mother years ago
before you run her off.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.324
S0 congratulations.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.885
Buried that word
a long time ago.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.768
I feel uncomfortable
up here, you know?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.843
I feel uncomfortable.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.289
My mind goes round
and round and round and round.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.530
Grown men do strange things,
Maria.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.604
Grown men do strange things.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.685
There's only two things
in my life

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.526
I wanted to tell you,
all right?

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.091
I already told you one.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.731
And the other?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.924
It'll have to wait...

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.640
to another day.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.720
Let's go up top, okay?

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.281
Did you bring picnic?
What'd you cook?

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.927
- Yeah, it's right there.
- Oh, yeah where?

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.447
The day you cook.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.010
I'm trying-- trying to remember
when you were a little girl,

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.725
we planted a tree.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.803
It was there over there--
I can't remember which--

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.007
which one.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.571
It was you...

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.211
me and your mama planted it.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.680
I don't really remember.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.446
Oh, you--
you don't remember?

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.207
Well, you were
too busy chasing boys.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.010
Liar.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.571
- What?
- Liar.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.444
No liar.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.889
No, I'm not a liar.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.762
♪ Cheyenne, Cheyenne,
hop on my pony <i>I</i>

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.401
You always sing the same song,
but never finish it.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.284
I never finish it?
Well.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.927
Let's go on up here.
Let's see what's up here.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.650
You always--

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.325
you always liked
this horse, didn't you?

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.450
You always said it was
the best horse you ever sat on.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.841
That's for sure.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.491
Well,
starting tomorrow morning,

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.007
he's no longer mine,
he belongs to you.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.964
You're gonna ride him
from here on in.

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.641
- Are you serious?
- Oh, I'm serious.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.647
He's my gift to you, Maria.
Just enjoy it.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.331
I won't be needing him
anymore.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.205
Wow.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.091
How many sunsets
has a person seen

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.560
in a lifetime, I wonder.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:42.124
Quite a few, I imagine.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.682
No, the deal is,
how many are left?

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.403
- Let's go on back.
- Let's go.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.201
Watch out for the holes.
Watch out for the holes.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.163
I interviewed your son,
Ben,

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.205
and I know that you and him
are lying about Jimmy Davis.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.046
I also know that you
and that Peter Rogers

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.766
had an agreement concerning me
and possibly my son.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.449
You think you're above
the law, Mr. Briggs.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:48.162
People like you don't make
the world a better place.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.687
You think you do.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.610
I'm going to find out
what it is that you do

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.245
when nobody’s watching you.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.244
Ezekiel...

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.562
Can't forget...

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.643
I forget where it is.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.326
It's, uh...

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.848
The Lord thy God loved thee...

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.451
having ingrained thee

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.251
upon the palms of my hands.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.804
YOU don't like what I like?

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.963
- No, I don't like it.
- Why not?

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.806
You can change the damn thing.
Change it.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.361
What do you like?
What's, what's--

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.847
- Oh, reggae, you like reggae?
- Not reggae.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.086
Why don't you sing something?

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.124
- What?
- You sing something.

that I couldn't
understand you.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.130
I'm sorry that when
you were all grown up,

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.081
I made it all about me
because like most men,

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.688
I wanted a perfect family,
but like most men,

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.043
I was not a perfect husband
or father.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.886
Yeah.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.851
And I'm sorry because I know
we cannot start over.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:53.369
And that's what I'm most
sorry about. So.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.924
But I want you to know...

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.730
I accept you as you are
because you're my son.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.563
I'm sorry, too.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.451
- I've missed you.
- Yeah?

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.921
And I accept you as you are
because you're my dad,

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.162
and you're the only dad I got.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.880
Yeah.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.331
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.005
You're a good boy.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.366
What are we doing here?

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.206
Well...

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.801
there's something
I gotta do, Benny.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.088
- Dad--
- No, no.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.805
I gotta make things right.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.283
Yeah. Trust me.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.607
Let's go.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.128
This won't take too long,
l hope.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.366
Hello? Anyone home?

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.445
Hello? Anybody home?

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.681
Hello? Hello?

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.970
Who are you? What are you doing
in my house?

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.804
Uh, I knocked.
I'm sorry.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.166
I didn't hear it.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.920
Uh...

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.726
I wanted to tell you
what happened to your son.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.250
- My son?
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.845
Who are you?

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.201
I know you.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.922
I'm Scott Briggs.
We met before.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.926
This is my youngest son.
He knew your boy.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.403
They rode horses together.
Yeah.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.561
You are really Scott Briggs.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.565
Yes, ma'am, I am.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.486
And you have to hear
what I'm gonna tell you.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.004
IT'S difficult.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.966
A horse kicked your boy,

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.841
kicked him and...
killed him instantly.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.487
A what?

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.685
How do you know?

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.048
I was there.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.248
Easy son, easy. Move slow.
I know this horse. Easy.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.643
<i>Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you, son.</i>

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.445
No one's gonna hurt you.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.448
Oh, Lord, what do I do?
Oh, Lord, what do I do?

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.083
What have I done?
Oh, son, son.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.128
And I couldn't face anyone

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.409
'cause everything I did
caused it, but I didn't do it.

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:44.120
It was kinda like a...

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.840
a hit and run,
but I didn't do it.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.447
What happened?

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.490
Where's my Jimmy?

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.330
- Your Jimmy?
- Yes.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.366
Tell me!

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:03.689
Oh! Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am. I will.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.648
I got confused, went crazy.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.407
- Who are you? Who the hell are you?
- Dad!

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.846
Dad, let him go!
Let him go!

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.448
My mind broke down
and went in...

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.603
went in circles.

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.729
I didn't know what to do.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.971
S0 what I did was
the cowardly thing.

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.885
I... I buried him.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.168
I dug a big hole,
and I buried him.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.370
And I had to come
tell you this today.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.801
I had to.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.723
I'm sorry.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.407
I'm sorry.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.527
What kind of man are you?

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.843
Well, lady, grown men
do strange things sometimes.

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.882
We had to make... a grave.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.561
The storm washed it away
four years ago.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:45.249
You-- you had a grave with--
with our body.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:48.962
You left us without nothing.

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.726
Without nothing!
Without nothing!

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.807
It was an accident.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.371
- No!
- It was an accident.

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.768
No, no, no, no, no,
no,no,no,no.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.651
No, no, no, no, no,
no,no,no,no.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.248
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:19.289
Please go. Please go.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.249
Don’t-- don't touch me.

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.211
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:25.646
Don't touch me!

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.566
You walk hand in hand
with the Devil.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.243
I had to come to you today
'cause my time's up.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.120
Please go.

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.283
- Hey, hey.
- No. No.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:01.048
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:04.290
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.363
It's okay.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.365
What kind of a man you are.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.409
What kind of a man
you are.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:15.805
It's okay.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.690
My son.

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.570
My son.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.084
Thank you for coming, Ben boy.
I'm a coward.

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.970
Thank you. Thank you.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.043
Dad...

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:38.841
I never wanna see you again
for the rest of your life.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.806
Okay.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:50.886
Okay.

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.203
I knew you might be coming along
this way today.

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.005
How you know that?

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.163
I just do.
That's how I am.

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.644
I hear your son ropes
pretty good.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.211
Yeah.
Texas state champion.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.124
<i>Johnny says he knows
your husband.</i>

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.364
- Says he's a pretty good guy.
- You're blocking my door.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.126
I'm sorry.
Hell of a Marine.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.409
- Yeah, Marine pilot.
- Mm.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.007
My dad's a good guy, too.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.527
I hope you know that.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.408
I want you to stay away
from my father.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.921
I don't care if you're a...

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.289
lady Ranger or whatever.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:54.846
He's the only father I've got,

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.606
and I gotta make sure
I look out for him.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:58.966
What can I do for you?

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.485
Don't interrupt me.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.922
I want you to stay
away from my dad.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.567
He doesn't need this.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.361
That's the bottom line.
I hope you hear me.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.170
Anything else?

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.531
No, ma'am, not right now.

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.962
You're very brave
or very stupid.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.725
Excuse me.

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.724
You have a good day.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.006
Oh...

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:23.165
I think I'll take a little--
a little snooze here.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.807
Yeah. Yeah.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.007
I love you, Dad.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.601
I love you, too,
Ben boy, little Benny.

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.287
I love you, too.
Yeah.

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.045
If God won't forgive me...

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:51.405
maybe you will someday...
l hope.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.641
Ooh..

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.451
You're a good boy.

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.604
<i>A'</i>

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:57.126
There she is,
the girl of my dreams.

01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:01.968
You've been saying
that since we were kids.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.690
When we were kids,

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.925
we would play cowboys
and Indians like the kids do.

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.562
You know, only we would do it
with real horses.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.406
And guess who always...

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:17.928
always got the role
of the Indian girl.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.806
But now the Indian girl
wears a badge.

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.481
Yeah.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.404
You wanna go for a ride?

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:26.687
You bet.
