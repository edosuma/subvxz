Ow.

00:36.403 --> 00:37.301
Ow!

00:38.772 --> 00:41.036
Your shoe rash is gross, man.

00:42.409 --> 00:43.239
Ohh.

00:43.309 --> 00:44.606
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

00:45.979 --> 00:46.911
Ah, I'm just kidding.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.811
Man, I wish I had my other sock.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.612
This callus is going to junk up
my good time at PB's potluck.

00:51.684 --> 00:52.582
Don't worry, man!

00:52.652 --> 00:53.949
We're gonna have a ton of fun.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.248
We'll eat some melon.

Oh, hi, Finn.

Oh, my goodness!

01:14.641 --> 01:15.938
Sorry, Bounce House Princess.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.135
I didn't know it was you.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.905
Oh, that's okay.

01:18.978 --> 01:20.240
You wanna go inside?

01:20.313 --> 01:21.439

Thank you.

What's up with the limp?

01:42.001 --> 01:43.525
I've been going foot-nude
in this shoes.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.366
And now I've got this
turbo-huge callus.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.403
Well, sit down and relax.

01:48.475 --> 01:51.535
Oh! By the way, I entered
everyone's name into a raffle.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.809
And the winner gets
whatever is in that.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.474
Mysterious.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.517
Oh!

01:58.585 --> 01:59.415
Brought something
for the party.

01:59.486 --> 02:00.919
Oh! How wonderful!

02:00.987 --> 02:01.817
Bam.

02:01.888 --> 02:02.718

02:02.789 --> 02:03.619
Oh.

02:03.690 --> 02:04.554
It's warm.

02:04.624 --> 02:05.784
And I shook it up...

02:05.859 --> 02:06.689
a lot.

02:06.759 --> 02:07.589
Well...

02:07.660 --> 02:08.490

02:36.422 --> 02:39.289
My on-again, off-again G. F.,
Princess Bubblegum?!

My B. F. S, Finn and Jake?!

02:42.228 --> 02:44.628
All the fine Princesses
that want to date me?!

02:44.697 --> 02:45.994
What the heck?!

02:46.065 --> 02:49.364
My roll dogs for life are
throwing a party without me!

02:49.435 --> 02:52.029
Just when you think
you got some great bros,

02:52.105 --> 02:53.697
they kick you to the curb.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.707
Oh, I see how it is.

02:55.775 --> 02:59.438
They're gonna do me like that,
so I'm-a do them like <i>this!</i>

03:04.884 --> 03:05.976
Ca-caw!

03:07.587 --> 03:09.384
That's how owls do it.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.582
Well, hello, little one.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.149
You're going to help
me ruin a party.

03:16.429 --> 03:17.293
Huh?

03:35.014 --> 03:36.675
Oh, quiet, you.

03:39.118 --> 03:39.948
That's it for the kitties.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.821
How my bunnies doin'?

03:42.889 --> 03:45.380
Yes.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.982
That's it. Ah, yes.

03:47.060 --> 03:47.890
Gunther!

03:47.961 --> 03:49.326
More la-sag-na!

03:58.238 --> 03:59.967
Okay.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.666
Yes.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.402
Go, my little sour pusses.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.501
Ruin that party.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.248
Aww. Hey, guy.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.749
Jake, check out this cat.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.012
I don't like cats, man.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.781
Do you like fresh lemon
in your iced tea?

04:14.854 --> 04:16.378
Yes.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.720
Ha, ha! All right!

04:20.827 --> 04:24.285
It looks like you don't have to
make that lemon run after all.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.854
Yes!

04:25.932 --> 04:26.899
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.794
At least I still have
my party poopers!

04:31.904 --> 04:32.768
Ugh!

04:32.839 --> 04:33.703
Oh, glob!

04:37.777 --> 04:40.837
So much la-sag-na.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.081
Gunther, daddy needs you to
dress up like a princess so you

04:46.152 --> 04:48.814
can sneak into that party and
throw fruit punch on everybody.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.416
Huh? You want to do
that for daddy? Huh?

04:53.626 --> 04:54.684
Thanks, sweetie!

04:54.761 --> 04:56.422
I can always
count on my Gunts.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.433
Finishing touch.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.799
Yeah, Gunther!

05:03.870 --> 05:04.802
Hot!

05:04.871 --> 05:06.065
You better be careful,
Gunther,

05:06.139 --> 05:07.902
or I'll keep you like
this all the time.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.837
I... just might have
to chase you around...

05:10.910 --> 05:12.571
marry you.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.376
Ow! Just kidding!

05:17.283 --> 05:18.750
Arms out, Gunther.

05:31.631 --> 05:32.598
Yes.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.791
Thatta-Gunther!

05:33.866 --> 05:35.060
Get a cup of punch!

05:36.936 --> 05:38.870
Huh?

05:38.938 --> 05:39.836
Oh, hey, Gunther.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.272
Hey, everybody,
Gunther is here!

05:42.342 --> 05:44.333
Hey, Gunther!

05:44.410 --> 05:46.901
Gunther, come party with us!

05:46.979 --> 05:48.310
No, Gunther.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.076
Do <i>not</i> party with them!

05:50.149 --> 05:53.312
Get them buns on
the dance floor, girl!

05:53.386 --> 05:55.377
Gunther! Gunther!

05:55.455 --> 05:57.582
Gunther! Gunther!

05:57.657 --> 05:59.625
Gunther!

06:04.564 --> 06:06.589
No, Gunther!

06:09.669 --> 06:11.068
Hmm.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.069
Hey, Gunther.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.628
Let me get one
of them socks.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.469
Yeow!

06:15.541 --> 06:17.008
Ow!

06:17.076 --> 06:19.442
Oh, well, they think their
party's the bee's knees, huh?

06:19.512 --> 06:21.946
Well, their party is
the knees of nothing!

06:23.750 --> 06:24.774
Gunther!

06:24.851 --> 06:26.819
Gunther! Gunther!

06:26.886 --> 06:27.944
Bah!

06:28.020 --> 06:29.647
There ought to be a law!

06:29.722 --> 06:32.316
Wait a minute. There <i>is</i> a law!

06:33.626 --> 06:35.184
Do I have what it takes?

06:36.763 --> 06:38.162
Banana Guard.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.721
L-I'm calling to tattle.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.096
Okay.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.225
Who are you tattling on?

06:42.301 --> 06:43.996
The loud party going
on next door.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.300
It's bothering everyone
in the Ice Kingdom.

06:46.372 --> 06:47.498
Ice Kingdom?

06:47.573 --> 06:48.665
Is this the Ice King?

06:48.741 --> 06:49.833
Yes.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.434
Well, uh, we hate you, so...

06:55.114 --> 06:56.843
Banana Guard.

06:56.916 --> 07:01.478
Yes, this is a little old lady
calling about the loud party.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.044
Is this the Ice King?

07:03.122 --> 07:04.384
No!

07:04.457 --> 07:07.722
This is Mrs. Garambling... ton.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.659
Mrs. Garamblington?

07:09.729 --> 07:10.559
Yeah.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.460
Hold on.

07:11.531 --> 07:12.828
Let me get my husband.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.891
Hi. This is Ted Garamblington.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.095
I need you to
shut down this party.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.798
Your wife sounds pretty old.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.703
Uh... hold on.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.832
There's someone at the door.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.137
Yes? Hello?

07:25.611 --> 07:27.511
Hey, Mr. Garamblington, it's me,

07:27.580 --> 07:28.877
the pizza-delivery boy.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.540
Oh, hi, Johnny.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.551
Boy, that sure is a loud party out there.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.314
Hope it's not
bothering the Missus.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.117
Oh, it's okay, Johnny...

07:37.190 --> 07:38.919
I'm on the phone
with the Banana Guard.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.583
They're gonna take care of it.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.991
Oh. That's good.

07:42.061 --> 07:43.460
Uh, what do I owe you, Johnny?

07:43.529 --> 07:45.121
It's $12.57, Mr. G.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.062
Okay. There you go.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.690
Prices have gone up.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.428
Aw, geez, do you have anything smaller?

07:49.502 --> 07:50.764
Let me check with my brother George.

07:50.837 --> 07:51.769
Hey, George!

07:51.838 --> 07:52.805
What?!

07:52.872 --> 07:53.702
The pizza's here!

07:53.773 --> 07:54.865
You got any cash on you?

07:54.941 --> 07:56.135
I only got a $50 bill.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.642
Uh... Mr. Garamblington?

07:57.710 --> 08:00.144
- Yes?
- We'll take care of it.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.840
Ha ha!

08:01.914 --> 08:05.315
Now to watch
Banana Law in action.

08:16.596 --> 08:17.927
Two can play the party game!

08:19.432 --> 08:21.161
Ooh, nice.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.531
All right.
Come on, Gunthalina.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.695
I need you to pass out some
whirling dervishes.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.203
The guests are
getting restless.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.202
Loose grape medley.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.210
Stack of enriched-flour
tortillas.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.041
Start with Roger.
He looks famished.

08:39.318 --> 08:44.153
Everyone smile and eat and
make our neighbors jealous.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.212
Gunther!

08:45.291 --> 08:47.589
Gunther! Gunther!

08:47.660 --> 08:50.026
Bah! Gunther's too
captivating.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.996
Huh?

08:52.064 --> 08:53.429
Oh, yeah!

08:53.499 --> 08:55.364
Oh, this is my jam!

08:55.434 --> 08:57.299
Time to get my freak nasty on.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.100
Roger, dance with me!

09:00.172 --> 09:01.571
Hup! Ha!

09:01.641 --> 09:02.471
Whoo!

09:11.217 --> 09:12.184
Gunther!

09:12.251 --> 09:13.218
Gunther!

09:13.286 --> 09:14.116
Gunther!

09:14.186 --> 09:15.414
Come on!

09:15.488 --> 09:17.012
Oh, if only there
were some way

09:17.089 --> 09:19.990
I could magically
ruin their party.

09:20.059 --> 09:20.889
Oh!

09:20.960 --> 09:22.257
Oh. Wait a minute.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.555
Oh, lovable, forgetful me.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.503
H-hey!

09:33.873 --> 09:38.435
I thought you were my bros,
my roll dogs for life!

09:39.879 --> 09:40.903
Ice King!

09:40.980 --> 09:42.004
Ow!

09:42.081 --> 09:45.847
Hey, everybody,
take refuge in my body!

09:47.687 --> 09:50.178
Ice King, don't make me
stand up and whomp you!

09:50.256 --> 09:53.089
Well, if that's what it takes
for a fella to get noticed

09:53.159 --> 09:55.753
around here,
then whomp me!

09:59.732 --> 10:01.700
That's... it!

10:04.036 --> 10:06.766
Huh?!

10:06.839 --> 10:09.273
Oh, Mama, that's some stank!

10:09.342 --> 10:10.775
Aah!

10:10.843 --> 10:12.811
Why are you doing
this, I. K?

10:12.878 --> 10:15.312
Because <i>she</i> didn't invite
me to her potluck!

10:15.381 --> 10:17.110
Yes, I did!

10:17.183 --> 10:19.549
I sent your invite
in the mail!

10:19.619 --> 10:20.551
The mail?!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.019
Who reads the mail?!

10:22.088 --> 10:25.489
I just stack all my mail in a
tall pile until it falls over.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.721
Then I shred it to
use in cascarones!

10:31.130 --> 10:33.098
So, uh, can I party with you?

10:33.165 --> 10:35.929
Only if you promise
to stop acting nanners.
