FILM 7

01:08.520 --> 01:13.440
<i>First, rule breakers are called criminals.</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:16.320
<i>Then psychos.</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:19.600
<i>And, finally, prophets.</i>

01:39.280 --> 01:40.560
Help me.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.360
You need to go to the hospital.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.760
I don’t need to go anywhere.
It’s a scratch.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.600
There’s gauze in the drawer.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.240
You need stitches.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.560
Wrap it. It’ll heal.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.920
Go on. How are you?

02:37.720 --> 02:39.920
It passed through. Soft-tissue wound.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.280
It’ll heal like on a dog.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.280
Don’t tell anyone what you saw yesterday.

02:50.880 --> 02:51.960
And my father?

02:53.640 --> 02:55.280
Don’t tell anyone.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.320
He shot a man.
Let the police at least look for him.

03:02.120 --> 03:05.000
The won’t find him, definitely not now.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.560
Papa recently started drinking a lot. I’d come home,
and he’d be sleeping on the table.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.120
Until I dragged him into bed.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.880
And then all night,
he’d be muttering a name.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.840
What name?

03:31.040 --> 03:34.840
The same name you spoke, at the university
when you started to feel bad.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.120
Remember?

03:38.680 --> 03:39.680
Olya.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.480
Is it a coincidence, or…

03:52.840 --> 03:55.520
Since I was a child,
I’ve had this one dream.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.720
A nightmare.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.440
It was like a monster was chasing me.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.120
It was dark. I was running, and I fell.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.480
Then I was at a dead end.
There was nowhere to run.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.720
The monster loomed over me…

04:22.480 --> 04:24.480
and actually took me out of the dark.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.680
But I wasn’t afraid of him.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.960
I was afraid
that he’d turn out to be someone I know.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.440
Do you understand?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.160
I feel this is connected--

04:44.360 --> 04:45.760
Ognarev,

04:46.600 --> 04:49.760
the fact that Papa
doesn’t like me working with you,

04:50.680 --> 04:51.880
Olya.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.760
You know everything. Tell me.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.960
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

05:41.560 --> 05:42.880
<i>I love you.</i>

05:45.120 --> 05:48.280
The pharmacy has something
for your headache. Should I get it?

05:49.840 --> 05:51.440
No need. It’s going away.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.160
Shall we continue?

06:09.840 --> 06:12.040
You’ve had these since your breakdown?

06:14.440 --> 06:17.000
-What significance does that have?
-A direct one.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.000
The breakdown happened on the job.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.960
Taking that into account,

06:22.040 --> 06:25.920
I need to check your professional
and psychological fitness.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.160
Tell me all about it.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.800
In Malodementevsk, outside Moscow,
a serial killing started.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.000
The killer attacked on Saturdays.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.000
He killed people brutally,
without any particular motive.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.880
He left signs.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.160
-Keep your dog on a leash.
-He doesn’t bite.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.480
You can’t walk fighting dogs
without a muzzle, you know?

07:25.560 --> 07:26.960
<i>And who are you?</i> <i>Stop recording!</i>

07:30.600 --> 07:33.040
<i>He’s already bitten a child.</i>
<i>That’s not enough for you?</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:35.160
<i>It was the boy’s fault! He teased him.</i>

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
<i>Stop recording!</i>

07:43.320 --> 07:46.240
<i>“Beware-- vicious dog” signs make me mad.</i>

07:46.960 --> 07:49.080
<i>A dog isn’t vicious or good.</i>

07:49.400 --> 07:50.880
<i>Animals don’t have morals.</i>

07:51.480 --> 07:53.800
<i>They do what man sets them to.</i>

07:54.320 --> 07:55.920
<i>The sign should read:</i>

07:56.800 --> 07:58.800
<i>“Beware-- vicious owner.”</i>

08:00.400 --> 08:02.200
<i>Do you understand what I’m saying?</i>

08:02.280 --> 08:04.840
<i>The owner made the dog this way.</i> <i>He broadcasts aggression and evil</i>
<i>into the world.</i>

08:08.240 --> 08:09.840
<i>Should we endure this?</i>

08:10.360 --> 08:12.520
<i>Or should we teach him a lesson?</i>

08:12.600 --> 08:14.280
<i>And through him, teach another.</i>

08:14.920 --> 08:17.480
<i>Look at this subhuman and consider.</i>

08:17.560 --> 08:20.800
<i>Is he making the world better,</i>
<i>or will it be better without him?</i>

08:21.400 --> 08:22.880
<i>It’s up to you.</i>

08:23.720 --> 08:26.000
UPLOADING FILE

08:26.080 --> 08:28.680
BEWARE-- VICIOUS OWNER!
WHAT NEXT?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.880
Look at the road, not at me.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.280
You don’t like that I’m driving?

09:01.520 --> 09:02.720
Ego.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.440
You didn’t have to take that bullet. It would have been better
if it had hit you.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.520
MALODEMENTEVSK / SEPTEMBER 11

09:25.400 --> 09:26.560
POLICE

09:26.640 --> 09:28.320
Don’t smoke here.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.440
Major Meglin?

09:31.160 --> 09:32.200
Move over.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.880
-He’s…
-Having a bad day. Yes, I see.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.040
-Did they shoot the dog?
-Yes, and took it away.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.560
I feel sorry for the dog.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
What do you see?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.240
Dog food.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.440
He stunned him,
then cut his face and spread food on it.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.560
The dog chewed his owner’s face.
Time of death?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.320
Between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.280
The wife was questioned.
He took a walk that time every morning.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.560
What’s this?

10:15.680 --> 10:16.920
His signature.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
<i>Three bodies so far.</i>

10:21.880 --> 10:24.800
Niyazov, a maintenance worker.
Lishenko, a businessman.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.680
And Gavrilov here, a civil servant.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.880
He attacks from behind, stunning them.
The trauma is consistent with a hammer.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.840
Then he kills them all differently.

10:32.920 --> 10:37.240
He drove a funnel into Niyazov’s mouth
and poured acetone in it. He choked.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.880
Creative approach.
What happened to the second?

10:40.480 --> 10:42.280
-He drilled him.
-What did he drill?

10:43.400 --> 10:46.120
In his ear, with a portable drill.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.280
And you say I’m sick.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.960
Are the victims connected?

10:53.680 --> 10:54.840
It hasn’t been determined.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.480
All the men are aged 40 to 53.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.040
They lived here in Silikatny.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.560
According to our databases,
none of them came through here.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
What?

11:08.680 --> 11:12.440
You said there are three bodies,
but there are four pins.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.000
Sergei survived.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.360
Our colleague.
He works as a beat cop in this district.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.760
There’s a witness.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.840
He helped put together a composite sketch.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.080
There’s a composite sketch.

11:30.160 --> 11:33.040
The Sabbatarian stunned him
but didn’t kill him.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.360
The son intervened.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.360
He saved his father’s life.
Well, if you’d call it a life.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.720
What do you see?

11:45.360 --> 11:48.640
-Where’s the bathroom?
-Left, right, then straight ahead.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.440
SERGEI YASHIN’S APARTMENT

11:56.560 --> 11:58.040
Please, come in.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.840
I’m sorry.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.880
Now, Papa, we’re going to talk.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.040
That.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.040
Papa asked me to hang that up.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.880
It might help him remember. Fedya.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.920
Father took a walk every day…

12:50.360 --> 12:51.560
in the evening.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.200
He took me with him.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.480
There’s a road there along the park…

12:57.080 --> 12:58.240
a path.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.920
He ran out of cigarettes and…

13:03.000 --> 13:04.400
sent me to buy some.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.200
When I came back,
he was being beaten under a street lamp.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
I yelled and started to call for help.

13:13.040 --> 13:17.600
He straightened up,
looked at me and ran into the park.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.680
Did you manage to get a look at him?

13:19.760 --> 13:21.680
It was dark there.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.960
I only saw how tall he was.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.040
Papa is probably 6’2”.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.400
He’s… probably about the same.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.120
Is this your mom?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.680
Yes. She was killed.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.640
Ten years ago-- a car wreck.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.360
Are you working or in school?

13:41.440 --> 13:42.280
I’m in school.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.680
I’m a sophomore.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.880
Right now, I’m taking a break.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.840
PRAYERS
HYMN - “THANK GOD FOR EVERYTHING”

13:49.720 --> 13:51.480
Papa is very religious.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.800
I hope it helps him.

13:54.880 --> 13:55.920
In what way?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
Well…

13:58.920 --> 14:02.160
He’ll be like this
for the rest of his life.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.040
He can hear and understand everything…

14:08.040 --> 14:10.240
but he can’t speak or move.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.480
How did they do the composite sketch?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.440
He can move a finger.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.680
Twice for “yes.” Once for “no.”

14:19.360 --> 14:21.760
The artist worked on it for four days.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.440
Can I talk to him?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.960
Yes, only you…

14:28.320 --> 14:31.440
have to ask questions
where he can answer “yes” or “no”.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.640
-Twice for “yes” and once for “no”.
-Yeah.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.400
So, excuse me. Now.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.240
I’ll do it myself.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.400
Seryozh, do you hear me?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.600
He hears me.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.480
Seryozh, here’s what I think.

14:51.560 --> 14:55.240
Life-- is it worth it
to continue to live… like this?

14:59.080 --> 15:00.480
Please leave.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.000
-Quiet, quiet.
-Please leave.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.560
Please leave. Please leave!

15:08.640 --> 15:09.800
Please leave. Outside!

15:15.520 --> 15:17.560
Fedya, I’m sorry for that.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.680
Is it possible for you to not drink?

15:42.920 --> 15:44.640
I only drink when I have to.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.480
Did you find something?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.800
A connection between the victims.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.240
All are newcomers, except the beat cop.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.800
That means not all of them.
There’s one “but.”

15:59.880 --> 16:03.560
What kind of logic is that?
You’re not looking in the right place.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.440
Their similarity is in their differences.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.840
How is that?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.800
The way they were murdered?

16:17.120 --> 16:20.160
He doesn’t kill random people
for no reason.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.680
Right?
He follows them, prepares the attack.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.520
He has a motive. There’s a rationale.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.280
I talked with the locals.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.680
Not many will be crying over the dead.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.760
In fact, it’s the opposite.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.400
Gavrilov--
the dog bit someone’s little boy,

16:43.800 --> 16:45.440
almost gnawed him to death.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.360
Gavrilov paid his way out of it.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.520
The businessman also pissed everyone off.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.920
He bought up the floor-level apartments.
There were three years of repairs.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.880
The ruckus, the noise.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.120
Only they didn’t file complaints.
It was pointless.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.280
The drill.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.200
The drill.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.560
And it seems this janitor
was dealing drugs, so…

17:13.000 --> 17:14.839
It’s easier on people.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.960
They’ve started sleeping peacefully.
They let their children go to the park.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.160
One of them told me,

17:24.920 --> 17:28.240
“If I wouldn’t go to jail for it,
I’d kill them all myself.”

17:31.440 --> 17:35.480
He kills those who hurt others.

17:36.920 --> 17:40.800
He kills sinners with their own sins.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.120
And now he’s going to accelerate.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.920
He’s a killer on a mission,
working for the public good.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.720
These three were a warm-up, a primer.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.360
Now he’s going to create his masterpiece.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.280
-He’s just waiting.
-For what?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.560
For us to arrive.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.200
WHAT NEXT?

18:16.440 --> 18:17.680
All right.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.040
I’ll be there soon.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.120
POLICE

19:57.120 --> 19:58.720
What do you mean “exploded?”

20:02.440 --> 20:04.400
He put a charge inside her and lit it.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.240
Have you found out who she is?

20:06.320 --> 20:07.720
We’re working on it.

20:08.480 --> 20:12.320
She didn’t have a phone or an ID.
We’re checking her prints.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.600
Come here.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.480
What do you see?

20:16.560 --> 20:17.440
A dog lover.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.720
It’s lined with silk. It’s for people.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.920
-A prostitute.
-Excellent.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.080
The dress.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.480
He asked her to dress subtly, so that his
neighbors won’t snitch. The wife’s away.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.800
What’s this?

20:28.880 --> 20:31.000
She came by gypsy cab or taxi.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.640
-Run the taxi drivers.
-We’ll do it.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.920
Come here. Look at this.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.800
She put up a fight, made noise.
He had no time to drag her away.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.520
She was killed near her destination.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.680
It’s the Bermuda Triangle there.
There’s two nine-story buildings.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.680
He waited for her by the entrance.
He knew exactly when she’d arrive.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.600
He knew her.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.400
The Sabbatarian called her.

20:59.480 --> 21:03.640
Well, finally!
Did I have to pull that out with pliers?

21:04.080 --> 21:07.160
Canvass the houses with her photo.
Is there a password?

21:07.240 --> 21:08.840
-There is.
-What is it?

21:09.360 --> 21:11.440
-Sherlock.
-What?

21:11.520 --> 21:12.720
Sherlock. Sherlock?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.520
Sherlock, damn.

21:25.800 --> 21:31.000
THREE HOURS LATER…

21:31.080 --> 21:34.280
CALL LIKA AND GELYA

21:38.880 --> 21:40.880
You’re still wearing the collar.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.640
There were no keys in her purse.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.880
Someone’s supposed to open the door
for her when she gets home. Correct?

21:58.520 --> 21:59.680
Look what I found. Here.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.600
Does it match?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.520
The necklace is similar.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.400
Lika and Gelya-- a sweet pair.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.520
Just so. A world of luxury and scandal.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.040
Hello.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.600
-Hello.
-Quickly. The neighbors.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.920
There it is, the den of debauchery.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.360
Tea? Coffee?

22:55.400 --> 22:56.520
What’s your name?

22:57.040 --> 22:57.960
Lika.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.960
Lika, where’s your friend?

23:02.080 --> 23:04.960
She’s not home. You didn’t call.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.240
Is this her?

23:24.720 --> 23:26.440
Was she from Moldovia?

23:27.880 --> 23:30.560
We came here together.
I talked her into it.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.760
What will I tell her mother now?

23:39.400 --> 23:41.240
Did she have any strange acquaintances?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.480
Everyone here is weird.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.600
They’re normal in Moldovia,
but here they’re…

23:53.680 --> 23:57.200
I mean aggressive, cruel, mean.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.760
There was one guy.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.920
He got an STD and said it was from Gelya.
She was clean. She was checked.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.680
What kind of customer was he?
What was his name?

24:07.760 --> 24:09.720
Igor I think.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.360
I didn’t see him.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.720
But his wife left him.
He proposed that Gelya live with him.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.880
She was afraid, and he tipped off the cops
that she didn’t have proper papers

24:20.960 --> 24:22.840
because she wouldn’t go along.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.640
Then he talked her into visiting him
again.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Why?

24:34.360 --> 24:37.040
She liked him. She loved tall guys.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.600
She’s still so young.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.000
She was 19.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.160
Where did she see him?

25:08.960 --> 25:10.560
In Silikatny.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.880
She also told me
he had tattoos on his hands.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.200
What kind?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.240
Crosses.

25:20.800 --> 25:24.040
Just admit that I’m right.
All the victims are newcomers.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.040
-And the beat cop?
-It’s possible he knew something.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.440
Newcomers make up half the city here.
Unlock the car.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.520
But the swastika on the hand
and that fist?

25:30.600 --> 25:33.760
Can you admit just once that I’m right?
Me.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.840
We found the cab driver.
He took her to Lenin Street, number 20.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.680
Did you get a list of the residents?
Check all the Igors.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.800
One more thing. Do you have any,
how would you say, Nazi friends?

25:43.880 --> 25:45.200
My colleague wants to talk to them.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.680
Ones who are working for us? No.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.520
Well, we know who they are.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.680
All of them, Sherlock. Get to work, go.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.080
Unlock the car.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.280
-Did you tell anyone why you called them?
-No.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.240
Igor Yakovlevich
asked me not to tell anyone.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.640
Correct.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.160
Fighting crazies is a…

26:13.400 --> 26:15.280
nationwide job.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.160
But it’s quiet.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.480
-Do you want my opinion?
-Well?

26:24.440 --> 26:26.320
I don’t think he’s the killer.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.200
He does what everyone wants to.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.280
And you too?

26:39.520 --> 26:42.320
GLORY TO RUSSIA
RUSSIA FOR RUSSIANS

26:42.400 --> 26:44.520
Vitalik, what are the cops doing here?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.160
Everything’s fine. Come in.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.040
Guys--

26:52.840 --> 26:54.080
Why are you standing there?

26:56.280 --> 26:57.000
Hey, you!

27:31.240 --> 27:33.320
-Hello.
-Hello.

27:45.800 --> 27:46.800
Hey!

28:33.480 --> 28:35.840
Guys, look what these pigs are doing.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.600
What’s the deal?

28:37.680 --> 28:39.360
-What are you doing?
-Hey! Hands off.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.240
Let’s go.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.360
-Listen, pig, what are you doing?
-Get away from the car.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.680
What’s with you, woman?

28:44.760 --> 28:47.520
-Show some respect!
-Hey! Where are you going?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.200
Let him go. -Hey!
-What are you doing?

29:00.360 --> 29:02.640
He immediately started to smash it.
Got it?

29:04.160 --> 29:06.640
That means
there’s something important inside.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.360
I don’t know.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.880
I’ll take a look.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.520
All right, I’m going.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.400
Bye.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.520
I’ll only talk with an attorney present.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
You’ll have a lawyer.
You’ll have one, Igorek.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.000
Only he’ll come and go,
and you’ll still be here.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.440
And you won’t be sitting in a cell with me
or your attorney.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.080
You’ll be with hardened cons.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.880
Those guys will tear
your tattooed hide to pieces.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.280
But if you start talking,
everything will be easier.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.320
If you talk to us, be open about things,
we’ll be civil to you.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.120
Yeah?

29:51.440 --> 29:53.040
Yeah…

29:54.320 --> 29:56.400
But only with my attorney present.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.040
Well, all right.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.440
All right.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.080
You don’t have anything on me.

30:28.240 --> 30:31.000
MOSCOW - FSB ARCHIVES / SEPTEMBER 12

30:34.200 --> 30:35.360
Hello.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.360
-Hey.
-Hello.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.600
Does your mother
let you read this sort of stuff?

31:08.680 --> 31:09.880
Give it to me.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.200
Zhen, I’m serious. Give it to me.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.240
Here. Don’t get worked up.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.880
Since when are you on the case?

31:23.480 --> 31:25.640
I don’t have anything to say to you.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.440
Wow, we’ve really talked a lot.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.000
Have you forgotten
she was my classmate too?

31:42.040 --> 31:43.640
I have a theory.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.040
But it needs to be checked.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.400
And as soon as I learn something,
or if I need your help,

31:50.480 --> 31:52.360
I’ll call you right away.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.360
Uh-huh.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.840
Do you promise? You’ll really call?

32:02.400 --> 32:04.000
Screw off, Zhen.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.240
He has a theory.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.200
A theoretician.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.840
LIGHTNING

32:43.480 --> 32:46.560
With this kind of evidence,
the court would tell you to screw off.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.480
He called the deceased an hour
before her death and threatened her.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.600
Yura, who? A prostitute?

32:51.680 --> 32:54.280
He called her.
Of course, let’s be judges of morality.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.600
What ties him to the murder?
Do you have prints? Witnesses?

32:57.680 --> 33:00.080
You have nice shoes. Are they expensive?

33:00.160 --> 33:03.440
-I work within the framework of the law.
-I understand. Let’s go.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.920
Here’s how it is, Yur.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
He’s going to be released now,
and I won’t bring up the assault.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.360
What’s today-- Friday?

33:30.920 --> 33:32.880
I’ll put people on him.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.040
Let him try something.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.600
Glukhoi. Yes.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.120
He went into a closed online community.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.880
It’s like a club
based on shared interests.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.199
Snuff, porno, torture.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.000
600 subscribers, password-protected.

34:12.120 --> 34:17.120
Well, judging by the user names,
they’re white nationalists and Nazis.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.000
Perverts basically.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.520
WEAPONS

35:29.040 --> 35:31.880
PASSWORD:

35:31.960 --> 35:33.400
User SKIN just logged in. He’s online.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.920
He has a second computer.
Let’s go, Sherlock.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.240
Yes, Fedya.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.200
Fedya called.
Yashin is ready to make an identification.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.680
See Yashin. As soon as he makes
the identification, call me.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.240
POLICE

36:12.000 --> 36:13.200
Yes.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.960
It’s him.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.240
Yes?

36:31.040 --> 36:32.400
Seryoga identified him.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.320
Let’s do it!

36:37.240 --> 36:38.400
SPECIAL FORCES

36:40.160 --> 36:43.600
-Get down!
-Police! Everyone freeze! Don’t move!

36:44.840 --> 36:46.720
Guys, I just replaced that door.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.680
Easy, easy.

36:50.360 --> 36:53.680
-This time you’ll talk, bitch.
-You’re too late. Too late.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.160
Well, what?

36:58.760 --> 37:00.840
It’s too late. It’s already online.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.440
MESSAGE FROM THE SABBATARIAN

37:12.920 --> 37:15.080
Guys, the Sabbatarian sent an e-mail.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.000
Open it.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.280
-I’m sorry we were so late.
-It’s okay.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.840
I hope that we helped.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Excuse me.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.040
Esenya.

37:45.120 --> 37:49.320
<i>Citizens-- brothers and sisters.</i>

37:50.840 --> 37:52.680
<i>Look how we live.</i>

37:53.800 --> 37:55.520
<i>We’re surrounded by falsehood,</i>

37:56.160 --> 37:57.320
<i>wickedness…</i>

37:58.360 --> 38:00.600
<i>hypocrisy, lies.</i>

38:01.760 --> 38:03.480
<i>We no longer honor the law.</i>

38:03.560 --> 38:04.720
<i>Who are you?</i>

38:04.800 --> 38:06.880
<i>We don’t honor God.</i>

38:07.880 --> 38:11.040
<i>Over the course of a month, I punished</i>
<i>the lost people in our community.</i>

38:15.920 --> 38:17.480
<i>I cleaned up my city.</i>

38:28.400 --> 38:29.920
<i>It was my Sabbath.</i>

38:41.160 --> 38:43.160
<i>I invite you to join me.</i>

38:45.240 --> 38:48.240
<i>Of all wicked men, the worst</i>

38:48.840 --> 38:52.400
<i>Meet Esenya Steklova.</i>

38:53.000 --> 38:54.640
<i>She’s 22 years old</i>

38:54.720 --> 38:57.480
<i>and already a detective for major crimes.</i>

38:57.960 --> 38:59.600
<i>Our protector.</i>

39:00.240 --> 39:01.440

39:19.040 --> 39:21.840
<i>Tell me honestly.</i>
<i>Do you believe she’s protecting you?</i>

39:23.000 --> 39:25.640
<i>Or is it you</i>
<i>who needs to be protected from her?</i>

39:27.200 --> 39:28.400
<i>It’s up to you.</i>

39:29.280 --> 39:32.000
<i>Vote “for” or “against.”</i>

39:32.080 --> 39:34.680
<i>For the safety of your children.</i>

39:34.760 --> 39:36.920
<i>For order in the streets.</i>

39:37.000 --> 39:39.600
<i>For honest authorities.</i>

39:40.200 --> 39:41.400
The beat cop.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.200
They must have all gone through him.
Call Esenya.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.000
<i>Time is up.</i>

39:57.080 --> 39:58.280
Fedya.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.360
-She…
-I understand. Let’s go!

40:12.040 --> 40:13.280
Fedya. Esenya!

41:54.040 --> 41:56.000
Pop, is Mama coming home?

41:56.480 --> 41:58.960
Pop? Is Mama coming back?

42:00.400 --> 42:02.240
Is Mama coming back?

42:02.320 --> 42:04.720
Mama died.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.040
<i>Pray.</i>

42:09.120 --> 42:10.360
<i>Pop, I don’t understand.</i>

42:10.440 --> 42:11.760
Pray. Pray.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.400
I don’t understand. What is this?

42:17.480 --> 42:21.920
What is this? A “D”!
Are you a dumb ass? Are you stupid?

42:22.440 --> 42:24.120
As we agreed.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.240
It seems we didn’t agree.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.920
Dear Papa, please play with me.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.080
-Next month, you’ll bring more.
-Dear Papa, please.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.520
How will that work?

42:36.120 --> 42:37.920
Go play with yourself.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.960
A great gift.

42:41.680 --> 42:42.560
Obviously.

42:44.880 --> 42:47.600
Well? Shall we pour it?

42:47.680 --> 42:49.080
All in a row.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.880
Well, where are you?
Are we going to do it or not?

42:53.400 --> 42:54.600
Who are you?

42:56.400 --> 42:59.280
What are you doing here, you brat?
Get out of here!

43:10.040 --> 43:11.440
Hi, Pop. Take a walk?

43:15.280 --> 43:16.360
What?

43:16.960 --> 43:19.400
What the hell is this?

43:20.440 --> 43:21.840
Don’t do that.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.680
<i>Pray! I said pray!</i>

43:34.240 --> 43:35.560
<i>Well!</i>

43:35.640 --> 43:39.560
Our Father who art in heaven,

43:39.640 --> 43:44.000
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,

43:44.520 --> 43:46.160
thy will be done,

43:46.920 --> 43:49.200
on earth as it is in heaven.

43:52.160 --> 43:54.200
Give us this day our daily bread…

43:55.480 --> 44:00.760
and forgive us our debts
as we also have forgiven our debtors.

44:02.080 --> 44:06.320
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.720
For you are our Lord

44:09.800 --> 44:12.920
now, always, and forever.

44:13.440 --> 44:14.440
Amen.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.080
Where are you? What’s your name?
Do you remember?

44:34.640 --> 44:35.640
Where’s Esenya?

44:35.720 --> 44:38.000
Glukhoi called. He located her phone.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.280
All right.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.280
WHAT NEXT?

44:46.440 --> 44:48.520
Wait here. I’ll speak. Where is she?

44:48.600 --> 44:50.600
-Don’t come any closer.
-Where is she?

44:52.480 --> 44:53.920
Move to the right.

44:54.440 --> 44:57.600
I can’t hear out of my left ear.
He burst my eardrum.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.160
Can I sit?

45:01.640 --> 45:04.960
If a hair on her head is harmed,
you’ll wish you were never born.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.080
For 18 years, I wished I was never born.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.640
You think you can threaten me with pain?

45:10.480 --> 45:12.520
I’ve had nothing else but that.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.880
Did your father mock you?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.520
You could’ve killed him.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.200
Why the others?

45:19.280 --> 45:20.960
-They’re innocent.
-Innocent?

45:21.840 --> 45:24.920
I saw how they brought him money,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.160
how he did a prostitute on Mother’s bed.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.000
Who’s innocent there?

45:31.160 --> 45:33.760
He taught me… duty,

45:34.480 --> 45:35.880
love for our homeland.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.120
And he took bribes…

45:39.520 --> 45:41.600
and shut his eyes when he was asked to.

45:42.120 --> 45:45.400
Listen, how about this? You let her go,

45:46.040 --> 45:48.640
and I’ll help you get into
a mental facility instead of prison.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.000
No.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.800
These four weeks were the best of my life.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.640
I said something,
and people listened to me.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.160
And, within a week,
someone just like me will appear.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.360
And within a month, hundreds.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.800
Because I did what others want to do
but can’t.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.760
The people are for me.

46:12.440 --> 46:13.840
No, Fedya.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.240
You aren’t the chosen one.

46:17.600 --> 46:22.440
You’re just covering your own sickness
with this bullshit.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.600
Where is Esenya?

46:26.800 --> 46:28.000
She’s alive.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.480
But she’ll die.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.360
Soon.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.520
And you can’t do anything about it.

46:35.800 --> 46:40.440
Actually, more people voted against.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.600
A lot more.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.200
They think you’re a psycho.

46:45.080 --> 46:46.280
Look.

46:47.120 --> 46:48.520
Look, look. I’ll wait.

46:59.440 --> 47:00.680
Give me a smoke.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.320
Look for the car.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.640
What?

47:47.720 --> 47:49.320
Look for the car!

47:50.680 --> 47:52.720
-Let’s go.
-Cover the area.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.240
Here, here!

48:45.880 --> 48:47.480
Call an ambulance.

48:51.040 --> 48:53.760
<i>First, he cut down his father in the park</i>
<i>when things boiled over.</i>

48:54.360 --> 48:56.640
Then he probably realized
how easy it is to kill,

48:56.720 --> 48:58.600
even if your opponent is stronger.

48:58.680 --> 49:01.960
But he couldn’t just kill like that.
That meant recognizing his illness.

49:02.600 --> 49:06.320
He went online and found a community
that shared his interests.

49:06.400 --> 49:07.880
He found an audience.

49:07.960 --> 49:09.600
He used it expertly.

49:09.680 --> 49:12.520
He put up Gelya as the first candidate.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.440
He drove up the votes with her.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.400
Your excesses
were supposed to be the death of you.

49:18.480 --> 49:21.400
He was full of ironies.
Let me try. Gimme, gimme.

49:24.640 --> 49:26.520
People were against it?

49:26.600 --> 49:28.200
Do you want the truth?

49:30.640 --> 49:32.120
I was against it.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.800
Take her away. Bye.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.320
Yura.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.920
You need to change that password.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.000
How come you never shot anyone?

50:06.400 --> 50:08.280
Meglin said, one time…

50:09.320 --> 50:11.280
a pistol deceives you.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.800
It gives you a false sense of safety
and security-- that it’s easy to kill.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.280
But you mustn’t kill…

50:26.480 --> 50:28.360
until your hands are ready.

50:50.120 --> 50:52.720
NIZHNY NOVGOROD

50:52.800 --> 50:55.040
I’m probably keeping you, aren’t I?

50:55.120 --> 50:58.480
What’s the rush. It’s so beautiful.
