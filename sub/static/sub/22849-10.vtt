00:09.583 --> 00:15.041
THE DAY OF MIKKEL'S DISAPPEARANCE

01:51.791 --> 01:54.666
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

01:55.083 --> 01:58.791
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

01:59.833 --> 02:02.791
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

02:02.875 --> 02:05.000
the courage to change the things I can...

03:09.083 --> 03:11.041
SCHOOL ID - MADS NIELSEN

03:11.125 --> 03:12.000
Tronte!

03:14.000 --> 03:14.833
I...

03:15.750 --> 03:16.916
It's me, Peter.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.666
I...

03:19.750 --> 03:22.291
There's something here you should see.

03:24.416 --> 03:26.916
It's to do with your son.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.666
No, not Ulrich.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.000
Mads.

03:42.083 --> 03:42.916
How...

03:47.666 --> 03:48.833
That's impossible.

03:51.708 --> 03:53.250
That's impossible.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.000
He was just there all of a sudden.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.333
Mads.

04:10.666 --> 04:11.666
Mads.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.166
Someone's coming.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.000
Tronte.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.291
Claudia?

04:59.333 --> 05:00.166
Peter.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.833
There's a lot I have to explain.

05:11.375 --> 05:15.500
But first we need to take Mads
to the place where he is to be found.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.708
We don't have much time left.

06:50.916 --> 06:55.541
ALPHA AND OMEGA

08:11.708 --> 08:13.208
I'm sorry.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.708
I really fucked up.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.708
Since Mikkel disappeared...

08:23.125 --> 08:25.166
I don't recognize myself anymore.

08:30.666 --> 08:32.500
It doesn't matter, okay?

08:38.791 --> 08:40.083
Everything's okay.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.375
Everything's okay.

08:54.541 --> 08:56.166
You know how he is.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.250
He usually comes back after a few hours.

08:59.958 --> 09:01.625
He's never been gone this long.

09:05.208 --> 09:07.583
Was my colleague Ulrich Nielsen
here again?

09:08.250 --> 09:10.458
No. Not that I'm aware of, anyway.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.916
Only on Saturday,
when he lashed out at Mr. Doppler.

09:15.666 --> 09:17.583
As if your father-in-law
had something to do with the case.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.541
Did you know?

10:10.833 --> 10:12.208
Did I know what?

10:14.625 --> 10:16.166
The boy from the future.

10:22.625 --> 10:23.875
You knew.

10:41.291 --> 10:42.500
This is for you.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.500
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.208
-That's impossible.
-What?

10:54.166 --> 10:55.416
I burned it.

11:02.416 --> 11:04.000
How long have you known?

11:06.208 --> 11:08.333
I've always known, really.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.041
When your father came to me,

11:16.500 --> 11:18.750
he was a disturbed little boy.

11:19.416 --> 11:22.083
I just thought
he had an overactive imagination.

11:22.791 --> 11:27.458
That something bad must have happened
to him, something he couldn't bear.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.541
He told me...

11:31.708 --> 11:33.291
he came from the future.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.625
I didn't believe him.

11:38.958 --> 11:40.458
If you knew...

11:43.833 --> 11:45.208
why didn't you stop it?

11:46.166 --> 11:49.166
I didn't know
that he would take his own life.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.916
But you could have saved Mikkel!

11:53.625 --> 11:56.583
Now I have another grandma
and she's the principal of my school!

11:58.083 --> 12:01.541
Her husband, who's fucking my mom,
is looking for his son, who's my father!

12:05.916 --> 12:07.875
A few days ago I kissed my aunt.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.333
And the crazy thing is...

12:19.333 --> 12:21.375
there's nothing wrong with any of them.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.166
They're okay.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.875
I'm what's wrong.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.291
I think things...

12:32.625 --> 12:34.458
no matter how abnormal

12:34.958 --> 12:36.750
or strange they seem to us,

12:36.833 --> 12:38.458
happen for a reason.

12:39.791 --> 12:42.250
Who are we to play God?

12:44.375 --> 12:46.291
What's past is past.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.208
But you...

12:49.083 --> 12:50.916
live in the here and now.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.958
Who knows what the future will bring.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.708
I just want everything
to go back to normal.

13:04.875 --> 13:08.291
As a kid, all that Houdini dreamed of
was becoming a magician.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.833
Do you have the same dream?

13:30.750 --> 13:31.583
Yes.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.208
But the magic I want to do is impossible.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.250
Which is what?

13:37.833 --> 13:39.416
I just want to finally wake up.

13:43.041 --> 13:45.333
Have you heard of Master Zhuang's paradox?

13:48.166 --> 13:50.166
I dreamt I was a butterfly.

13:51.458 --> 13:54.666
Now I've woken up
and no longer know if I'm a person

13:54.750 --> 13:57.541
who dreamed he's a butterfly,

13:58.750 --> 14:00.958
or if I'm a butterfly who's dreaming

14:01.458 --> 14:02.958
it's a person.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.666
What are you?

14:08.416 --> 14:10.875
A person or a butterfly?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.250
Maybe I'm both.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.625
My name is Egon Tiedemann.

14:32.791 --> 14:35.291
Maybe we can just start
with you telling me your name.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.416
Tiedemann?

14:37.458 --> 14:39.000
Egon, yes...

14:39.083 --> 14:40.125
Of course.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.750
-Are you a Satanist?
-A Satanist?

14:49.833 --> 14:51.750
No, I'm a cop.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.375
A cop?

14:54.875 --> 14:56.583
It's a song from the 80s.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.958
I can tell you now, you won't like it.

15:02.208 --> 15:03.208
Look into the camera.

15:05.791 --> 15:07.375
Why did you kill the children?

15:08.958 --> 15:11.458
I didn't kill the children.
I tried to save them.

15:14.458 --> 15:15.958
What did you do to Helge?

15:18.708 --> 15:20.250
He's still alive.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.625
He must be.
Or the children wouldn't be dead.

15:23.708 --> 15:25.208
Where is Helge now?

15:26.416 --> 15:28.541
-Where is he?
-I can change it all.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.708
I can change everything that's going
to happen, but you have to let me go.

15:33.708 --> 15:34.833
-Look into the camera.
-Please!

15:34.916 --> 15:36.166
Look into the camera!

15:40.750 --> 15:42.833
You know what we do
with child murderers here?

15:42.916 --> 15:44.458
You stupid asshole.

15:46.125 --> 15:49.083
You're just as small-minded
as everyone else in this shitty town.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.583
Let me go!

15:52.416 --> 15:55.666
Are you already drinking, or will you
start after your wife leaves you,

15:55.750 --> 15:58.041
and you realize
how pathetic and pitiful you are?

15:58.666 --> 16:00.250
Let me go! Let me go!

16:00.333 --> 16:02.291
Leave me! Let me out!

16:04.291 --> 16:07.000
I need to get to my son.
I have to find my son!

16:23.875 --> 16:25.541
I waited for you.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.708
On Thursday.

16:27.791 --> 16:30.416
-Yes, fuck...
-What do you mean "fuck"?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.375
I didn't tell anyone
you were in the nuthouse.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.166
I lied for you.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.875
France, baguettes...

16:38.208 --> 16:39.958
Blah, blah, blah...

16:40.708 --> 16:43.166
Turns out you lie pretty well yourself.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.583
You don't even need me.

16:45.958 --> 16:47.500
Martha told me everything.

16:49.166 --> 16:52.083
-It just happened. I really didn't...
-What didn't you want?

16:52.666 --> 16:53.666
To blow me off?

16:53.750 --> 16:55.041
To lie to me?

16:55.125 --> 16:56.666
To make out with my girlfriend?

16:56.750 --> 16:58.250
You're a sick piece of shit!

16:58.833 --> 17:00.000
Just like your dad.

17:13.458 --> 17:14.583
What are you doing?

17:16.541 --> 17:17.833
Have you lost it?

17:20.625 --> 17:22.333
Don't ever come back here!

17:23.083 --> 17:24.583
Get the hell out of here!

17:56.125 --> 17:57.833
You repaired it.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.833
That one's yours.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.083
And this one's mine.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.958
I built it many years ago.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.208
It's the same device,

18:08.291 --> 18:10.416
but in a different condition.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.000
You see.

18:14.166 --> 18:15.708
It's as if

18:15.791 --> 18:19.916
one could look at the beginning and end
of something at the same time.

18:21.291 --> 18:22.666
Wait a moment.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.333
This thing here

18:29.125 --> 18:32.708
it sends a kind of signal.

18:33.708 --> 18:36.791
An electromagnetic impulse.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.166
As if it were trying
to communicate with something.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.916
And look at this.

18:42.708 --> 18:45.541
This part has never moved.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.416
It was included in the blueprint,
but I never knew what it was for.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.750
This thing communicates with the device.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.916
It's not just the past
that influences the future.

18:59.708 --> 19:02.625
The future also influences the past.

19:03.583 --> 19:04.625
You see.

19:05.250 --> 19:09.291
If you hadn't shown me what the device
looks like in the future,

19:09.375 --> 19:11.333
I wouldn't have been able to build it.

19:12.541 --> 19:13.666
A paradox.

19:15.791 --> 19:17.375
These openings

19:18.166 --> 19:20.000
didn't exist either.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.916
I have no idea what their purpose is.

19:29.541 --> 19:30.625
What's that?

19:32.333 --> 19:34.583
Cs-137.

19:36.541 --> 19:38.958
A radioactive isotope of Cesium.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.416
The device generates a Higgs field.

19:51.666 --> 19:55.000
It increases the mass of the Cesium,

19:57.333 --> 20:00.416
An electromagnetic impulse causes it

20:00.500 --> 20:03.500
to implode into a black hole.

20:06.666 --> 20:10.041
The same thing must have happened
during the nuclear power plant incident.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.666
Why did you decide to help me after all?

20:15.541 --> 20:16.375
Why?

20:18.625 --> 20:20.208
That's a big word.

20:21.375 --> 20:25.208
Why do we decide for one thing
and against another?

20:26.333 --> 20:29.958
But does it matter
whether the decision is based upon

20:30.041 --> 20:35.208
the consequence
of a series of causal links?

20:35.291 --> 20:39.875
Or whether it stems from
an undefined feeling inside me?

20:41.583 --> 20:47.791
That perhaps everything in my life
boils down to this one moment.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.750
That I'm part of a puzzle.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.791
One that I can neither understand

20:54.875 --> 20:56.541
nor influence.

21:02.708 --> 21:04.125
Will you tell me...

21:04.958 --> 21:06.791
what the future's like?

21:10.416 --> 21:12.791
I'm hoping that by tomorrow,
it'll already be different from today.

21:26.541 --> 21:27.375
Yes?

21:27.791 --> 21:30.000
Your father was kidnapped as a kid, right?

21:30.083 --> 21:31.458
Do you remember when exactly?

21:33.083 --> 21:33.916
I...

21:34.958 --> 21:35.958
Can we talk? I...

21:36.666 --> 21:39.500
- I have to tell you something...
-When exactly? '53? '54?

21:42.708 --> 21:43.791
Fall of '53.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.000
'53.

21:47.416 --> 21:49.041
Exactly 66 years ago.

21:50.166 --> 21:51.833
Two times 33.

21:51.916 --> 21:54.041
- It's all connected.
-Listen, Charlotte, I...

21:54.625 --> 21:56.041
I have to talk to you.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.416
Later, okay? I've got to go.

22:51.750 --> 22:53.458
Can I help you?

23:04.750 --> 23:06.250
Were you looking for me?

23:08.125 --> 23:09.625
You have to stop.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.458
What do I have to stop?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.500
He's using you.

23:19.541 --> 23:21.708
All of his promises are lies.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.958
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.666
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.041
I've said that before.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.458
Everything Noah says

23:40.250 --> 23:41.750
is a lie.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.875
He's not the chosen one.

23:43.958 --> 23:45.458
You're not the chosen one.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.291
He doesn't want
to save the world from evil.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.250
He is evil.

23:52.291 --> 23:54.125
Today is the day.

23:54.958 --> 23:56.625
The beginning and the end.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.041
Don't make the same mistakes I made.

24:00.791 --> 24:03.750
Don't make the same mistakes I made.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.500
You have to stop.

24:10.875 --> 24:12.500
You have to stop!

24:29.958 --> 24:31.416
I have to stop.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.875
What happened to you?

25:24.708 --> 25:26.083
I got into a fight.

25:26.708 --> 25:27.708
What?

25:28.250 --> 25:29.541
With whom?

25:30.583 --> 25:32.208
It doesn't matter.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.583
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

25:44.541 --> 25:45.625
Everything will be fine.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.541
I left something at school.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.541
Don't worry. Everything will be fine, Mom.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.750
Charlotte asked me about the cabin.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.791
And Helge.

26:19.583 --> 26:21.208
About what happened in '53.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.833
A few more hours, and it'll be over.

26:28.125 --> 26:29.625
Mads will live.

26:30.958 --> 26:31.916
Do you believe her?

26:34.666 --> 26:38.541
Everything she said would happen
has happened in the last eight days.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.166
Just as it's written here.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.791
Then why have half of the pages
been torn out?

26:49.916 --> 26:51.458
What happens after today?

26:52.250 --> 26:53.583
After today...

26:54.125 --> 26:55.416
everything will be new.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.750
But if there is no God,

27:07.291 --> 27:09.125
then why do we believe in a lie?

27:12.666 --> 27:15.541
Because we prefer any lie to the pain.

27:17.791 --> 27:20.708
Years ago, I was still a little boy.

27:20.791 --> 27:22.333
A stranger came to us.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.083
He looked as if he'd been in the war.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.541
Didn't talk much.

27:29.750 --> 27:32.416
There was this sadness in his eyes.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.875
The kind you sometimes see
in those who want to die,

27:34.958 --> 27:36.083
but life won't let them.

27:40.416 --> 27:41.916
He took a room in our house.

27:42.708 --> 27:44.333
The bedroom right next to mine.

27:44.416 --> 27:45.250
And...

27:46.458 --> 27:48.500
sometimes I heard him talk in his sleep.

27:49.958 --> 27:51.041
Confused words.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.125
But one night, he was suddenly very clear.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.416
He stood in the hallway,

27:57.500 --> 27:59.333
his eyes wide open, and said...

28:01.500 --> 28:03.458
"Nothing is in vain.

28:05.875 --> 28:07.166
Not a single breath.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.333
Not a single step, not a single word.

28:11.416 --> 28:12.458
Not pain.

28:13.666 --> 28:17.000
An eternal miracle of the One."

28:19.291 --> 28:21.208
I didn't understand any of his words.

28:23.750 --> 28:26.291
Only years later, when I felt the pain,

28:28.041 --> 28:29.708
did I understand what he meant.

28:32.041 --> 28:36.041
That none of the horrible things
that befall us should be in vain.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.458
That's my son!

28:37.541 --> 28:40.500
That they make us what we are.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.541
That they give us our strength.

28:47.666 --> 28:49.916
Your pain made you who you are, Helge.

28:52.708 --> 28:54.666
But it no longer has power over you.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.833
Who is next?

29:19.625 --> 29:21.208
Jonas Kahnwald.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.458
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.166
You can always come and visit him.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.291
I'm taking you to your new home.

29:48.791 --> 29:50.958
There are lots of other children there.

29:57.791 --> 29:59.125
-Can you hear me?
-Come.

29:59.583 --> 30:00.416
Come.

30:08.958 --> 30:12.333
You know, I've made a decision.
I want to adopt him.

30:12.416 --> 30:16.000
And to take provisional custody
of him during the adoption procedure...

30:16.083 --> 30:17.375
I'm afraid it's not so easy.

30:17.458 --> 30:20.333
I have references. I own a home.

30:20.416 --> 30:24.083
-I...
-It's a very complicated process.

30:24.166 --> 30:25.166
I know.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.000
It may seem somewhat rash.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.291
But it isn't.

30:29.375 --> 30:32.333
-I can't just decide here...
-The boy likes me.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.083
He trusts me.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.750
I'm the only person
he lets close to him, and...

30:39.666 --> 30:41.125
And I...

30:42.833 --> 30:44.458
I like him, too.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.125
What day is it today?

31:06.708 --> 31:08.500
-The 12th.
-What year?

31:09.583 --> 31:10.416
'86.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.000
Are you from here?

31:19.333 --> 31:20.833
What are you doing here?

31:23.375 --> 31:24.875
Bringing someone back from the dead.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.250
How does that work?

31:29.916 --> 31:31.375
It's very hard to explain.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.125
Can you bring these back?

31:37.125 --> 31:39.083
No, you have to find them
when they're younger.

31:43.416 --> 31:45.000
But then they're not dead yet.

31:45.458 --> 31:47.541
That doesn't change the fact
that they will die.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.000
You're crazy.

31:55.458 --> 31:56.291
Maybe.

32:09.791 --> 32:11.708
"Helge Doppler. Nine years old.

32:11.791 --> 32:14.000
Went missing on November 10, 1953.

32:14.083 --> 32:17.208
The kidnapping is being linked
to an unknown person."

32:19.875 --> 32:20.750
Page five.

32:23.666 --> 32:26.166
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

32:56.291 --> 32:58.375
Let me go. Please!

33:00.375 --> 33:02.000
Please, let me go.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.333
Where is Helge?

33:15.416 --> 33:16.791
You don't want to talk?

33:17.583 --> 33:19.333
I'll teach you how to talk.

33:58.583 --> 33:59.500
Who are you?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.958
-There's no need to be afraid.
-Hey!

34:58.041 --> 35:00.750
Hey! What's this supposed to be?
What is this?

35:01.125 --> 35:02.791
Why did you lock me in here?

35:03.333 --> 35:04.833
It wasn't me.

35:04.916 --> 35:06.250
It was Noah.

35:06.333 --> 35:07.625
Who's Noah?

35:07.708 --> 35:09.250
Where am I? What is this?

35:10.166 --> 35:12.625
This is a kind of prototype
of a time machine.

35:13.416 --> 35:15.166
You're the guinea pig.

35:15.791 --> 35:18.583
The passage in the cave
lies directly under this bunker.

35:18.666 --> 35:21.041
If opened,
the energy flows through this room.

35:21.125 --> 35:22.833
But it needs to be increased.

35:23.583 --> 35:24.833
No DeLorean.

35:24.916 --> 35:26.416
No hissing or steam.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.250
The first time machine
is a bunker with four walls.

35:29.333 --> 35:31.125
But it still doesn't quite work.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.208
-Let me out of here.
-I can't.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.375
It's the only way for things
to be normal again.

35:37.458 --> 35:38.791
Who are you?

35:40.375 --> 35:41.791
You don't know?

35:46.333 --> 35:47.541
The letter.

35:48.083 --> 35:49.583
You burned it.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.041
And yet it still exists.

35:54.750 --> 35:59.125
You'll carry that letter for almost 33 years
before you pass it on.

36:00.541 --> 36:01.958
To yourself.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.833
I am you.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.333
My name is Jonas Kahnwald.

36:14.583 --> 36:16.333
I sent the letter to you.

36:17.083 --> 36:18.750
Or should I say, to me.

36:18.833 --> 36:21.416
Everything you're experiencing,
I've already experienced.

36:25.166 --> 36:28.916
I burned the letter, just like you.
I got it back from our grandmother.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.958
I've already had this conversation.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.875
But I was on the other side then.

36:34.250 --> 36:36.458
We think we're free, but we're not.

36:36.541 --> 36:38.458
We follow the same old path.

36:38.958 --> 36:40.333
Again and again.

36:40.416 --> 36:41.791
That's crazy!

36:43.083 --> 36:44.708
It doesn't make any sense!

36:46.083 --> 36:48.250
You can decide to let me go now.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.166
Come on, let me out!

36:52.250 --> 36:54.958
I thought it was crazy for a long time.
That I'm crazy.

36:57.125 --> 37:00.625
But I can't let you out because then
you won't become what I am today.

37:00.708 --> 37:03.958
If I now change my past,
I will change who I am right now.

37:04.041 --> 37:07.250
And then I won't be able
to destroy the hole once and for all.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.833
Why did you kiss Martha?

37:13.375 --> 37:17.583
We're not free in what we do,
because we're not free in what we want.

37:17.666 --> 37:20.750
-We can't overcome what's deep within us.
-Stop it.

37:20.833 --> 37:21.666
Stop.

37:25.416 --> 37:26.583
Please stop.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.833
I have to bring Mikkel back.

37:29.916 --> 37:32.000
I want everything to go back to normal.

37:35.083 --> 37:38.083
I want all this sick shit to stop!

37:38.166 --> 37:39.541
You still do.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.208
Thirty-three years later.
I still want that.

37:43.916 --> 37:45.083
But Mikkel...

37:45.833 --> 37:48.750
Our father is just a small part
of a sprawling sickness.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.375
I've seen things
that no one should ever see.

37:55.583 --> 37:56.958
I'm sorry.

38:02.041 --> 38:02.875
Wait.

38:03.208 --> 38:04.500
Hey! Hey!

38:05.541 --> 38:06.625
Stop!

38:08.791 --> 38:09.916
Hey!

38:39.541 --> 38:44.041
But a brief blink of an eye
And then returns the night

38:49.125 --> 38:53.666
Somehow the future starts somewhere
Sometime

38:53.750 --> 38:56.083
I won't wait for long

38:58.166 --> 39:02.291
Love is created through bravery
So don't think about it twice

39:02.375 --> 39:06.750
We ride on fiery wheels
Towards the future through the night

40:30.625 --> 40:37.125
THURSDAY, NOV 13, 1986:
SEVERE ACCIDENT AT INTERSECTION

40:44.625 --> 40:47.000
COME TO THE CABIN.
WE NEED TO TALK. PETER.

40:54.333 --> 40:56.500
WHAT DOES NOAH WANT?

41:04.666 --> 41:07.458
Everything is about to begin.

41:14.250 --> 41:17.125
The older Jonas
will destroy the hole, but...

41:17.875 --> 41:20.250
he doesn't realize that he will be the one

41:20.333 --> 41:22.250
to trigger its existence.

41:22.333 --> 41:24.083
A paradox.

41:24.458 --> 41:26.916
The cesium in his useless machine

41:27.000 --> 41:29.541
won't destroy the hole forever.

41:30.666 --> 41:34.333
It's what creates it in the first place.

41:35.416 --> 41:37.416
He thinks he's the savior.

41:38.333 --> 41:40.791
But Claudia lied to him.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.583
Most people are nothing
but pawns on a chessboard.

41:47.416 --> 41:49.333
Led by an unknown hand.

41:50.916 --> 41:54.166
Their lives exist
only to be sacrificed for a higher goal.

41:55.166 --> 41:57.208
Jonas, Mikkel, the children,

41:57.291 --> 42:01.416
they're nothing but unfortunate,
yet necessary chess moves

42:02.583 --> 42:05.583
in an eternal war between good and evil.

42:07.708 --> 42:12.541
There are two groups out there
fighting to control time travel.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.000
Light and shadow.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.291
We belong to the light.

42:17.375 --> 42:18.500
Don't forget that.

42:19.708 --> 42:23.333
Even though some of what we do
is of a dark nature.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.083
But no victory is ever won
without sacrifice.

42:27.458 --> 42:29.916
As long as we're in this time loop

42:30.000 --> 42:32.541
we who know have to make sure
that every step will be repeated

42:32.625 --> 42:34.625
exactly as it was before.

42:36.291 --> 42:38.125
No matter how inhumane it seems to us.

42:38.208 --> 42:41.250
No matter what sacrifices
it demands of us.

42:42.250 --> 42:43.916
But believe me,

42:44.375 --> 42:47.083
the others are the ones
who are truly inhumane.

42:48.708 --> 42:51.708
They have lost all humanity.
They belong to the shadow.

42:52.583 --> 42:55.916
Your grandmother, Claudia,
belongs to the shadow.

42:56.666 --> 42:58.291
Never trust her.

42:58.916 --> 43:00.291
No matter what she says.

43:00.375 --> 43:01.375
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

43:02.291 --> 43:05.375
Jonas trusted her before
and he will trust her again.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.708
Jonas thinks he will change everything...

43:08.791 --> 43:11.083
but he's just her puppet.

43:12.041 --> 43:13.833
He doesn't deserve any better.

43:22.833 --> 43:25.541
Time is an infinite field.

43:28.333 --> 43:31.458
Millions and millions
of interlocking wheels.

43:33.375 --> 43:36.416
We have to be patient to be victorious.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.625
But our time will come.

43:44.583 --> 43:47.666
We will free humanity from its immaturity.

43:49.041 --> 43:50.250
From its pain.

43:52.291 --> 43:54.041
But you must be strong.

43:55.125 --> 43:56.333
Can you do that?

44:01.458 --> 44:02.291
Yes.

44:12.166 --> 44:13.458
It's time.

47:55.625 --> 47:57.666
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986

48:38.416 --> 48:40.333
One, two...

49:00.083 --> 49:02.791
One, two, three.

52:51.333 --> 52:53.541
Hey, you. Hands up!

52:55.000 --> 52:56.083
On the ground!

52:59.166 --> 53:00.041
Who are you?

53:13.083 --> 53:14.000
Where am I?

53:15.333 --> 53:16.416
What year is this?

53:40.333 --> 53:41.916
Welcome to the future.

56:33.916 --> 56:37.916
