00:01.641 --> 00:04.596
Kapatau's having this end
of the world party this weekend.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.336
We'll see what we can do to
get your o-chem grades back up.

00:07.461 --> 00:10.225
{\pos(192,240)}You left. Aren't you gonna get in
trouble for leaving the lab?

00:10.350 --> 00:12.988
- I'll figure that out tomorrow.
- I decided I don't want my trust fund.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.799
Don't play this game with us, Evan.

00:14.974 --> 00:18.099
We make an agreement, a pledge to
not have sex with our tempters.

00:19.359 --> 00:21.087
It's the four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

00:21.219 --> 00:23.537
Don't you read the scriptures?
There's gonna be signs.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.775
- There is no more I-Kap.
- I'm disbanding the house. I'm leaving.

00:26.956 --> 00:29.319
- For real, this time.
- I'm in love with Cappie.

00:29.566 --> 00:31.627
- What are you doing?
- I want to be with you.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.866
Don't ruin things with max
because of some fleeting thought.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.845
- You don't even want to try?
- Dumped?

00:37.038 --> 00:38.687
Casey says it wasn't 'cause of Cappie,

00:38.812 --> 00:40.618
- but I know it was.
- How do you know?

00:40.755 --> 00:43.225
I saw them come out
of a closet together.

00:43.350 --> 00:45.627
And then she dumped me.
Never pick the girl.

00:46.008 --> 00:48.538
They'll leave you every time.
You can count on it.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.829
So Casey broke up with Max
because of you.

00:50.954 --> 00:53.592
Let the countdown to
the end of the world begin!

00:53.763 --> 00:55.980
<i>- Six... Five...
- It's the end of the world, Cappie.</i>

00:56.105 --> 00:58.228
<i>-  Four... Three...
- What are you gonna do?</i>

00:58.553 --> 01:01.015
<i>Two... One...</i>

01:33.976 --> 01:37.012
You know, it's kind of weird to
watch people while they sleep.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.181
Sorry.

01:40.590 --> 01:42.142
No, no, I meant him.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.138
Jeremy, go to your place.

01:52.422 --> 01:54.218
- Are you OK?
- What?

01:55.966 --> 01:57.824
Still thinking about Casey and Max?

01:58.116 --> 02:00.617
Do you really think Cappie's
the reason they broke up?

02:00.742 --> 02:01.933
That's what Max said.

02:02.058 --> 02:06.044
So are, like, Cappie and Casey
dating now? That's so weird for me.

02:08.815 --> 02:11.230
Let's do something fun today,
just you and me.

02:11.355 --> 02:14.625
We could
drive up to canyon lake.

02:15.956 --> 02:18.795
- That sounds like... Crap!
- It was just a suggestion.

02:18.927 --> 02:22.224
No, I have to finish my stupid
O-Chem extra credit today.

02:22.506 --> 02:24.732
You're not gonna get in trouble
for skipping out, are you?

02:24.857 --> 02:26.729
No. Hastings left the lab before I did.

02:26.898 --> 02:29.403
I just have to show him
my results first thing tomorrow,

02:29.528 --> 02:32.760
which is why I have to get back
to the lab to finish it today.

02:32.962 --> 02:34.430
OK, well, good luck.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.096
- Call me later.
- I will.

02:46.605 --> 02:47.605
Dude!

02:48.373 --> 02:51.080
- Get off my hand, dude.
- Ouch! Dumb-ass.

02:56.401 --> 02:57.847
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:58.723 --> 03:00.944
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you still at Fisher's?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.844
I came home early to check on you.

03:04.331 --> 03:06.913
- Thanks, Ash.
- So, hitting the showers?

03:10.028 --> 03:12.801
- Do you want to come with me?
- Why? What's going on in our room?

03:12.986 --> 03:14.319
Is someone else in there?

03:20.535 --> 03:21.490
Case.

03:22.575 --> 03:24.452
I had a pity party last night.

03:25.776 --> 03:26.958
Is that salsa?

03:27.083 --> 03:30.428
I may have eaten a box
of frozen taquitos...

03:31.620 --> 03:35.090
...and some cookies, but they were
in the 100-calorie packages, so

03:35.600 --> 03:37.738
I had seven of them.
I also watched

03:37.863 --> 03:39.828
the first hour of once twice

03:39.965 --> 03:43.398
and the last 45 minutes
of the notebookonce. But today,

03:43.990 --> 03:44.997
I'm great.

03:45.411 --> 03:47.546
So you're OK about Max?
No regrets?

03:47.849 --> 03:49.409
I'm still sad about Max.

03:49.546 --> 03:51.741
But today is a new day.
That's out

03:51.866 --> 03:55.275
of my system, no dwelling, no more pity.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.646
I've even decided to stay
positive about Cappie.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.643
I mean, I could sit here,
angst all over myself about

04:00.771 --> 04:03.128
him turning me down, but who knows?

04:03.260 --> 04:06.369
Maybe when he finds out
that max and I broke up, then...

04:07.984 --> 04:10.595
- I told him.
- Told who what? What's that?

04:10.720 --> 04:13.592
Last night after you left the party
I found Cappie on the roof and I

04:13.717 --> 04:15.371
told him that you and Max broke up.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.187
You did?
And... And?

04:18.426 --> 04:19.712
It was super dramatic.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.136
It was during the countdown to the end
of the &party and everyone's like,

04:23.306 --> 04:25.221
"eight, seven, six..."

04:25.445 --> 04:29.111
So... I mean,
how'd that go?

04:29.760 --> 04:31.985
Well, he thought about it...

04:32.639 --> 04:33.639
...a lot.

04:34.906 --> 04:38.040
I actually sat there for, like,
five minutes until I had to pee, so...

04:39.729 --> 04:41.570
It means he's probably still thinking.

04:43.725 --> 04:44.898
Well, if... If

04:45.619 --> 04:48.640
Cappie wants to give us another
shot, then...

04:48.765 --> 04:51.985
then he knows where I live.
He can come over here or call me.

04:52.193 --> 04:56.177
In the Meantime I am just going to...
Think about other things and...

05:02.947 --> 05:03.967
Just in Case.

05:06.228 --> 05:09.461
<i>You have felt the love inside</i>

05:09.729 --> 05:12.887
<i>but now that it's through</i>

05:13.281 --> 05:17.285
<i>our sister cat is broken</i>

05:17.776 --> 05:20.717
<i>we want to fix you</i>

05:21.728 --> 05:24.530
I wasn't sure if you wanted people
to know or not, but...

05:24.700 --> 05:26.565
It's not like it's the end of the world.

05:56.301 --> 05:59.130
{\pos(192,240)}I'm sorry about your breakup with Max,
but it's totally for the best.

05:59.255 --> 06:02.551
{\pos(192,240)}- Thanks, Laura.
- I mean, he was a nerd, but he was hot.

06:02.676 --> 06:04.254
{\pos(192,240)}It was just so confusing.

06:04.379 --> 06:08.148
{\pos(192,240)}- Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that.
- Time to get some guns, girls!

06:08.273 --> 06:09.971
{\pos(192,240)}Are we raiding the Iki house?

06:11.045 --> 06:14.894
{\pos(192,240)}Everyone, so, last night,
the ikis disbanded.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.729
{\pos(192,240)}Frannie's left
the greek system for good.

06:16.919 --> 06:20.637
But despite all the bad things she did,
deep down she really was a good...

06:20.762 --> 06:23.715
{\pos(192,240)}- What are the guns for, then?
- It's for gotcha, the Omega Chis'

06:23.928 --> 06:27.565
{\pos(192,220)}campus assassin game. Starts today.
Here are your dossiers.

06:28.791 --> 06:31.314
{\pos(192,240)}"The object of the game is to
eliminate your assigned target.

06:31.439 --> 06:33.600
{\pos(192,240)}If you succeed,
you take their target and the game

06:33.904 --> 06:36.108

06:36.233 --> 06:39.987
{\pos(192,240)}"And the winner receives a party
at Dobler's hosted in their honor while

06:40.112 --> 06:42.523

06:42.648 --> 06:44.569
{\pos(192,220)}and five points towards

{\pos(192,220)}"The game starts tonight at the dead

06:47.997 --> 06:50.156
"Come as your favorite assassin or spy."

{\pos(192,200)}I call Ethel Rosenberg.

06:54.499 --> 06:55.913
So are you gonna go tonight?

06:56.474 --> 06:58.153
{\pos(192,220)}I might just hang around the house.

06:58.663 --> 07:00.381
{\pos(192,230)}I got a gamma psi.

07:01.068 --> 07:02.068
No way.

07:02.621 --> 07:04.580
- Who'd you get?
- Who do you think?

07:08.245 --> 07:10.954
- Yeah. Wanna trade?
- Cappie can come to me.

07:13.059 --> 07:14.768
Or i can hunt him down tonight.

07:15.118 --> 07:16.610
I need water.

07:16.962 --> 07:19.348
Looks like someone
had a lot of fun last night.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.588
- Is "fun" a euphemism for vodka?
- I didn't have that much fun.

07:22.713 --> 07:26.335
Actually, i saw rebecca having
a lot of fun last night, with a guy.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.265
- No, you didn't.
- Who?

07:28.390 --> 07:31.605
It was hard to tell, given his face
was inside her mouth.

07:33.265 --> 07:35.068
Becks, who's the mystery man?

07:35.725 --> 07:37.565
I'm really not telling
any one of you.

07:41.216 --> 07:43.244
Is that my phone?
Whose phone is that?

07:45.247 --> 07:48.587
<i>I am the lord your
god, who brought you out</i>

07:48.712 --> 07:51.547
<i>of the land of egypt, out
of the house of slavery.</i>

07:51.672 --> 07:54.999
<i>You shall have no
other gods before me...</i>

07:55.124 --> 07:58.158
it's actually "Q" from "Star Trek".
Ever since i was a little kid,

07:58.283 --> 08:00.050
i liked to imagine
they sounded the same.

08:00.999 --> 08:03.015
This could very well be the worst

08:03.731 --> 08:07.200
i've ever felt in my entire life.

08:07.808 --> 08:10.483
- What happened last night?
- You don't remember the party?

08:10.608 --> 08:13.448
Getting frisky with your buddy grant?
Your purity pledge?

08:13.737 --> 08:14.919
Oh, no.

08:15.044 --> 08:16.417
Grant and i kissed.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.567
If anyone from the house
saw him, he's screwed.

08:18.692 --> 08:20.756
'cause he didn't
want to come out yet.

08:21.185 --> 08:23.054
Not to mention how they'll react

08:23.260 --> 08:25.354
having two gay guys in the house.

08:25.718 --> 08:28.827
One is fine, but
two is just a bathhouse.

08:28.952 --> 08:30.863
So you guys didn't do anything else?

08:31.731 --> 08:32.731
No.

08:34.727 --> 08:35.871
Wait a minute.

08:36.525 --> 08:38.707
The only reason i kissed
grant is 'cause i saw you

08:38.832 --> 08:40.735
and the landlady slide
into second base.

08:40.860 --> 08:41.962
What's up with that?

08:42.087 --> 08:44.740
Well, you know, i've got
really powerful pheromones.

08:45.075 --> 08:47.045
I had to fake a nosebleed
to get out of there.

08:47.442 --> 08:49.583
At least both of us
kept our purity pledges.

08:50.026 --> 08:52.223
Yeah. Hey, whose pants are those?

08:55.069 --> 08:56.782
Those would be mine.

08:59.246 --> 09:00.307
Oh, god.

09:02.482 --> 09:05.237
Morning! You're oot and aboot
early this fine sunday.

09:06.026 --> 09:07.613
Looking for Max, eh?

09:08.840 --> 09:11.700
Yep. I'm a friend of his.
I was hoping he can let me

09:11.825 --> 09:14.393
into the chemistry
building for this lab today.

09:15.002 --> 09:16.936
- Have you seen him?
- He left.

09:17.061 --> 09:19.269
- Do you know when he's coming back?
- Oh, he quit.

09:19.394 --> 09:21.660
Quit? What, he quit his ra job?

09:21.785 --> 09:24.345
I think he had to since he
quit the graduate program.

09:24.470 --> 09:25.831
Oh, in one night?

09:29.498 --> 09:32.096
He went back to england to work with
George Stephanopoulos.

09:32.221 --> 09:34.107
Magda Stephanopoulos.

09:37.569 --> 09:40.132
<i>Please deliver to:
Casey Cartwright Zeta Beta House </i>

09:41.543 --> 09:43.683
did he tell you he was
leaving the country?

09:43.808 --> 09:45.620
- Did you talk to him?
- This morning.

09:45.745 --> 09:47.707
He said there was nothing
here for him anymore.

09:47.832 --> 09:49.505
So he's really gone.

09:50.421 --> 09:52.250
Gee, i'm sorry.

09:57.090 --> 10:00.817
<i>I call heaven and earth to
witness against you today,</i>

10:01.068 --> 10:03.207
<i>that i have set before you life...</i>

10:03.332 --> 10:06.385
dale, do you think we can give
q a rest for a little while?

10:07.164 --> 10:08.164
Yeah.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.955
<i>... that you and your
offspring may live...</i>

10:13.734 --> 10:16.480
you know,
school is a game of averages,

10:16.605 --> 10:19.852
and while i've never had
to average in a "d" before,

10:19.977 --> 10:21.712
maybe it's not as bad as we think.

10:21.837 --> 10:24.585
So without extra credit,
"d" on my midterm,

10:24.710 --> 10:27.032
even if i make 100 on the final,

10:27.157 --> 10:29.183
which is virtually impossible...

10:29.552 --> 10:31.496
... my average is still a low "c."

10:31.621 --> 10:33.265
I should've listened to you.

10:33.390 --> 10:35.998
Whoever said "live every day like it's
your last

10:36.123 --> 10:37.597
is an idiot.

10:37.722 --> 10:39.685
I guess the first rule
of living every day

10:39.810 --> 10:42.792
like the world's gonna end is to
make sure the world actually ends.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.836
Well, one world kind of ended.

10:45.564 --> 10:47.840
Even if i get "a's" in
my other honors classes

10:47.965 --> 10:50.684
i'm still gonna drop
below the required 3.5 cum.

10:50.809 --> 10:52.344
So, that's it.

10:53.882 --> 10:55.918
I'm out of the honors program.

11:04.423 --> 11:05.784
Sorry, rus.

11:05.909 --> 11:07.921
I'm dart gun shopping.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.740
- What's in the box?
- It's for you.

11:11.412 --> 11:12.710
It's from Max.

11:15.054 --> 11:18.219
So you know he and i, broke up?

11:18.630 --> 11:21.501
- Did you know he went back to england?
- He's gone? How?

11:21.626 --> 11:24.895
The grad program only gave him
a temporary leave of absence.

11:25.020 --> 11:28.164
Apparently he's taking a
permanent leave of absence now.

11:28.289 --> 11:31.865
I told you this would happen.
Scorched-earth, you know, remember?

11:31.990 --> 11:33.810
He fled the country because of you.

11:33.935 --> 11:37.114
You can't blame me for that.
It was his own choice.

11:38.016 --> 11:39.440
He was my friend

11:39.565 --> 11:43.224
and he was the only guy
at cru who inspired me academically.

11:43.349 --> 11:44.925
And now he's gone.

11:45.050 --> 11:48.561
That's no reason for me to
stay in a relationship with him.

11:48.686 --> 11:50.464
He just wasn't the right guy for me.

11:50.589 --> 11:53.531
- And Cappie is?
- I'm not with Cappie, i don't think.

11:53.656 --> 11:56.049
- You don't think?
- Look.

11:56.487 --> 11:59.897
I really am sorry about Max.

12:00.518 --> 12:03.799
But you can always call
him, email him,

12:03.924 --> 12:05.835
- skype him.
- I need him today,

12:05.960 --> 12:08.593
'cause i didn't finish my
grignard project last night.

12:08.718 --> 12:10.868
Grignard?
Like that guy from entourage?

12:10.993 --> 12:13.339
- Maybe i can help.
- Yeah, case, you can help me

12:13.464 --> 12:16.616
with my organic chemistry
report on the guy from entourage.

12:18.665 --> 12:20.002
Forget it.

12:20.127 --> 12:22.382
{/___________________PUB____________________}

12:29.006 --> 12:30.813
There's gotta be
something you can do.

12:30.938 --> 12:33.917
Is it too late to drop the
class or take an incomplete?

12:34.042 --> 12:35.484
I looked into all that.

12:37.503 --> 12:39.909
Gentlemen, if we want
to dominate at gotcha,

12:40.034 --> 12:42.286
then you pukes need all
the practice you can get.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.754
Marksmen, on your... marks.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.539
Aim... fire at Wil... bur.

12:52.202 --> 12:53.815
Suck it, Wilbur!

13:00.937 --> 13:03.520
That's two points for
Pickle, zero for Spitter.

13:03.645 --> 13:06.296
Have you talked to Cappie about this?
He might be able to help.

13:06.421 --> 13:08.511
The last thing i need is his help.

13:12.149 --> 13:13.805
- Spitter's disqualified.
- What?

13:13.930 --> 13:15.038
Pickle wins.

13:15.361 --> 13:18.198
- Why'd you shoot an old lady?
- How are you an old lady?

13:18.323 --> 13:20.405
Spitter's right.
You could've been a serial killer

13:20.530 --> 13:22.619
dressed to look like an
old lady, for all he knew.

13:22.744 --> 13:24.413
Haven't you seen Steel Magnolias?

13:24.538 --> 13:26.720
I don't think that's what
that movie was about, cap.

13:26.845 --> 13:28.875
No, but if you imagine they're

13:29.000 --> 13:31.013
secret homicidal maniacs
it's much more enjoyable.

13:31.138 --> 13:32.389
Cut Spitter some slack.

13:33.339 --> 13:36.079
Everything OK, Spitter?
You seem kind of...

13:36.451 --> 13:38.282
- clenched.
- I'm fine.

13:38.407 --> 13:40.503
I wish i could say the same for Max.

13:40.979 --> 13:43.771
Yeah. I heard they broke up
last night. How's she doing?

13:44.648 --> 13:47.203
Well, we all made choices last night

13:47.328 --> 13:49.349
and we just have to live
with those consequences.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.579
I guess you're right.

13:52.704 --> 13:54.202
Hey, beav, i'm up next.

14:04.953 --> 14:07.276
You really don't remember
what happened last night?

14:08.967 --> 14:11.181
The sex was pretty incredible,
right?

14:11.564 --> 14:14.065
No, i totally remember.

14:14.578 --> 14:16.594
Just a little hazy, is all.

14:16.719 --> 14:19.459
But, yeah, last night was great.

14:19.781 --> 14:22.963
Then you remember what
you said, about fate?

14:23.088 --> 14:25.287
Fate? Yeah.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.190
And eternity?

14:28.916 --> 14:31.404
Eternity? Really?

14:32.007 --> 14:35.546
I know you seem pretty
intent on a small ceremony,

14:35.671 --> 14:38.642
but i wouldn't mind
a big wedding in Maui,

14:38.767 --> 14:40.862
with our friends and family.

14:40.987 --> 14:43.451
OK, there's no way that
we talked about that.

14:43.576 --> 14:46.417
Consider this payback for
telling me dale's your boyfriend.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.126
Dude, you suck!

14:49.152 --> 14:50.519
Nothing happened.

14:50.644 --> 14:53.867
- We kissed. That was it.
- Yeah, at a kt party.

14:53.992 --> 14:56.424
Look, we're just gonna
have to be better

14:56.549 --> 14:59.164
and try to keep it quiet if
this is gonna continue, OK?

14:59.764 --> 15:01.553
Is this gonna continue?

15:05.103 --> 15:07.495
What happened to you guys last
night? You didn't come home.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.938
Nothing happened!
I stayed at Rusty's,

15:10.063 --> 15:12.945
and grant stayed someplace
completely different.

15:15.242 --> 15:16.924
Well, we have a busy day.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.395
I'm gonna take care of the
deposit on the booze for tonight.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.047
Grant, grab some pledges,
go pick it up this afternoon?

15:22.172 --> 15:23.719
Sure. You got it.

15:26.563 --> 15:28.627
Maybe later tonight's better.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.472
Yeah. It's a date.

15:30.828 --> 15:32.263
Sorta.

15:41.270 --> 15:43.583
Want a cat? Please?

15:43.708 --> 15:45.434
I'm all good, thanks.

15:45.559 --> 15:46.824
You're all dressed up.

15:46.949 --> 15:50.119
Oh, yeah. I need to find a
sexy spy costume for tonight.

15:50.244 --> 15:53.691
Do you think i can pull off this la femme
Nikita chick without the creepy'80s hair?

15:53.816 --> 15:56.632
I talked to Rusty and i'm a
little worried about him.

15:56.757 --> 15:59.461
Don't be. He always sounds
like that when he breathes.

15:59.586 --> 16:02.499
- You get used to it.
- No, i think he might be in trouble.

16:02.624 --> 16:05.885
And i think i'm the last
person he wants any help from.

16:06.010 --> 16:07.954
- Chocolate?
- It's about polymer science.

16:08.079 --> 16:10.072
Really, the last person that...

16:10.197 --> 16:12.001
he got a "d" on his o-chem midterm

16:12.126 --> 16:14.371
and he's probably gonna fail
out of the honors program.

16:14.496 --> 16:15.694
Fail out?

16:15.819 --> 16:18.371
He had a chance to make up for
it with this extra credit project,

16:18.496 --> 16:20.659
but he skipped out on
that to go to the party.

16:20.784 --> 16:22.236
I'm really worried about him.

16:22.361 --> 16:24.942
He's gotta get into the
lab and finish it tonight.

16:27.694 --> 16:28.939
Tonight?

16:29.064 --> 16:31.202
We could both use
help from our big sis.

16:35.388 --> 16:37.823
So fisher and i are going
to the dead man's party

16:37.948 --> 16:40.532
as Mr. And Mrs. Smith.
Which should be pretty easy for me

16:40.657 --> 16:43.469
since i already have plenty of
dresses that show off my boobs.

16:44.835 --> 16:48.839
- You could go as Angelina Jolie in "Wanted".
- What's the difference between angelina jolie

16:48.977 --> 16:51.550
in "Mr. And Mrs. Smith" and
Angelina Jolie in "Wanted"?

16:51.675 --> 16:53.579
Four kids, maybe five.

16:54.108 --> 16:55.762
I'm thinking Sydney Bristow.

16:56.987 --> 16:59.085
You know what i always
loved about Sydney Bristow?

16:59.210 --> 17:02.307
Her double life. It must
have been pretty hard for her

17:02.432 --> 17:04.877
to have to keep all those
secrets from her friends,

17:05.323 --> 17:07.073
her really close friends...

17:07.887 --> 17:10.196
- who she goes shopping with.
- Nice try.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.685
I'm still not telling
you who the guy was.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.703
I need cash.

17:14.828 --> 17:16.104
I need coffee.

17:16.229 --> 17:18.765
But i'm not giving up,
becks. I will not rest

17:18.890 --> 17:21.446
until i find out who
your mystery man is.

17:23.526 --> 17:26.156
Was she talking about
your gotcha target?

17:26.281 --> 17:27.496
I wish.

17:31.330 --> 17:32.951
How's your bank account zero?

17:33.076 --> 17:36.098
I don't know. Must be some
weird bank failure thing.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.010
Banks have been failing
all over these days.

17:39.486 --> 17:41.741
What's going on?
You can talk to me.

17:45.081 --> 17:47.315
OK. You remember homecoming?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.181
My parent problems?

17:50.112 --> 17:52.108
... i gave up my trust fund.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.401
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you an idiot?

17:54.526 --> 17:56.773
I thought you, of all
people, would understand.

17:56.898 --> 17:58.745
Oh, my god, you're poor.

17:59.534 --> 18:01.338
Not completely.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.636
I have some separate accounts,
my credit cards. I'm gonna be fine.

18:04.761 --> 18:06.230
For how long?

18:06.355 --> 18:07.727
Good question.

18:08.836 --> 18:11.651
Do you need some cash now?
I could help you out.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.653
I do. I need some cash for the
deposit on the kegs for tonight.

18:16.778 --> 18:18.157
I could pay you back later.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.924
Actually, if i could trouble you
for a favor, we could call it even.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.434
What do you think?

18:26.686 --> 18:28.954
<i>And his sword shall devour flesh...</i>

18:31.449 --> 18:34.501
<i>... from the long-haired
heads of the enemies.</i>

18:34.759 --> 18:38.043
<i>Rejoice in him, o heavens!
Bow down to him...</i>

18:38.867 --> 18:40.115
what the hell is that?

18:40.913 --> 18:43.059
It's "Q" from "Star Trek".

18:43.316 --> 18:45.448
I've grown to find
him oddly calming.

18:46.468 --> 18:49.611
I talked to jordan and she
told me about the honors program

18:49.736 --> 18:51.370
and i'm here to help.

18:53.203 --> 18:55.163
I know how important this is to you,

18:55.288 --> 18:58.259
and the fact is, when you
want something bad enough

18:58.384 --> 19:00.030
you'd do anything you can to get it.

19:00.155 --> 19:03.219
- It shouldn't take all day to figure it out.
- I'm fine with it.

19:03.344 --> 19:07.035
You made one hasty decision
without considering the repercussions.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.798
Don't let it ruin your future.

19:08.923 --> 19:10.731
No offense, but how
are you gonna help me?

19:11.053 --> 19:13.638
I may not know anything
about organic chemistry,

19:13.763 --> 19:15.869
but i know i can get
you into that building.

19:16.373 --> 19:18.427
I don't... no, i don't know.

19:18.552 --> 19:20.911
Stop wasting time.
Get your coat and let's go, now.

19:26.907 --> 19:28.655
You know you sounded
like mom just now?

19:28.780 --> 19:31.444
I know, and i'm
freaking out about it, OK?

19:32.132 --> 19:34.882
{/___________________PUB____________________}

19:35.687 --> 19:37.908
Did you two call to
have the building opened?

19:38.033 --> 19:40.697
Yes. My brother here
forgot his medication.

19:43.848 --> 19:46.563
- Yeah, he does look a little sickly.
- Yeah, he's, hypoglycemic.

19:46.688 --> 19:50.354
- That's why he looks that way.
- I'm hypoglycemic, not deaf.

19:52.767 --> 19:56.115
Rusty, i think you're looking a little
flush, like you might go into shock.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.457
- I don't think i am.
- Trust me. Think you are.

19:59.623 --> 20:00.860
I think you are.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.155
{\pos(192,210)}{\You know, }I think I'm feeling
a little light-headed.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.348
{\pos(192,210)}Let me look in my bag
for a candy bar.

20:08.473 --> 20:09.954
{\pos(192,210)}Hold on.
I've got a candy bar.

20:10.079 --> 20:11.209
{\pos(192,210)}Really?

20:12.503 --> 20:13.795
{\pos(192,210)}Here. Eat this.

20:14.161 --> 20:15.611
{\pos(192,210)}- Eat this.
- Why?

20:17.814 --> 20:19.926
Listen to him, Rusty.
He's a professional.

20:20.322 --> 20:21.322
Oh, God!

20:29.398 --> 20:31.104
I think that did the trick.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.799
He's looking much better now.

20:32.924 --> 20:33.924
Really?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.402
It comes and goes.
Thank you so much for your help.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.180
I'm gonna take him
to the student health center. Thank you.

20:41.870 --> 20:42.974
You were great.

20:43.099 --> 20:44.781
You were so awesome. Thank you.

20:44.906 --> 20:46.113
Check you later.

20:49.562 --> 20:50.811
Look at all of these keys.

20:50.936 --> 20:53.670
You'd think at a science building
they'd have fingerprint scanners{\ or something}.

20:53.795 --> 20:56.629
If we need his fingerprints,
we can get 'em off my tongue.

21:01.443 --> 21:03.214
OK. This might take a while.

21:12.611 --> 21:14.063
Thank you, pledge.

21:14.757 --> 21:17.046
It's my costume
for the dead man's party tonight.

21:17.474 --> 21:19.527
Aren't you a little wore out
from last night's party?

21:20.474 --> 21:21.474
Yeah. So?

21:23.518 --> 21:24.518
Anyway,

21:25.100 --> 21:28.609
I know you seem to help Rusty out a lot
with matters of the heart...

21:28.734 --> 21:30.805
- and flesh.
- {\You know, }I'm glad you mentioned Rusty.

21:30.930 --> 21:32.790
He's been moodier than usual today.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.959
Is there like an engineering
menses or something?

21:35.378 --> 21:37.587
Only when you're flunking out
of the program like he is.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.465
Since when?
Why didn't I know about this?

21:39.590 --> 21:42.520
I don't know. I figure he used to talk
to Max more about that kind of thing.

21:42.645 --> 21:45.303
I don't know.
Back to my problem, I'm having a...

21:45.471 --> 21:46.262
Used to?

21:49.217 --> 21:50.683
Maxi pad skipped the country.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.519
What? Since when?
Why didn't I know about this, either?

21:54.553 --> 21:55.730
Did you...

21:55.898 --> 21:58.233
Did you just say "Maxi pad"?
That is still funny.

21:59.477 --> 22:00.590
Yeah, I know.

22:00.715 --> 22:01.986
He left town this morning.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.448
Where's Rusty now?

22:04.320 --> 22:07.222
He left me a note. Seems he's gonna try
to get into the chem lab tonight.

22:07.722 --> 22:08.722
But...

22:08.987 --> 22:10.950
- the thing that I'm dealing with...
- I gotta go.

22:11.075 --> 22:13.998
- If you could finish up here...
- I'm not even positive what this is.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.764
Kinda having a personal crisis.

22:17.585 --> 22:19.653
- If I could just have a minute...
- You look good.

22:20.433 --> 22:21.433
Thanks.

22:26.482 --> 22:28.171
Delivery for Rebecca Logan.

22:29.027 --> 22:30.527
Rebecca got flowers!

22:31.225 --> 22:33.195
- What?
- You got flowers?

22:33.320 --> 22:35.395
I bet they're from the mystery guy.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.563
Don't!

22:38.524 --> 22:41.276
"Last night was amazing."
Signed, "E.C."

22:41.444 --> 22:42.777
Who's E.C.?

22:42.945 --> 22:44.320
Eric Chapman, from Pi Sigma?

22:45.948 --> 22:47.148
Edward Cullen.

22:47.415 --> 22:48.825
He's a fictitious character.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.786
Emma cannon? Is she a lesbian?
Are you a lesbian again?

22:51.958 --> 22:55.206
- It's Evan Chambers!
- Evan Chambers? Really?

22:55.915 --> 22:56.916
You got me.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.306
He and I made out at the party,
and I know that's bad

22:59.431 --> 23:00.878
because of the whole Casey thing.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.198
You don't have to worry
about Casey and the girl code.

23:03.323 --> 23:06.217
I can think of a million other reasons
you should want to keep this a secret,

23:06.385 --> 23:07.844
but Casey and Evan are old news.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.638
So you should do
whatever makes you happy.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.808
Evan's gonna be at the party tonight.
You should give it a shot.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.940
Now, tell me everything
that happened last night.

23:19.353 --> 23:20.353
God...

23:20.979 --> 23:22.229
Where to start?

23:23.651 --> 23:26.528
Thanks for letting me raid your closet.
You are the only person I know

23:26.653 --> 23:29.711
that might have clothes
resembling Austin Powers.

23:29.836 --> 23:30.836
Thanks.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.370
So you really didn't end up breaking
your purity pledge at all?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.205
Nope. Aren't you proud of me?

23:36.743 --> 23:38.875
- The proudest.
- Doesn't mean I'm not going to, though.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.753
I really like Grant. He's awesome.
We're gonna give it a shot.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.588
What about the house
and the brothers?

23:44.291 --> 23:47.122
Just have to keep it quiet.
I did it last year with Heath.

23:47.519 --> 23:49.991
Come to think of it, I'm pretty good
at sneaking around.

23:50.116 --> 23:51.988
Maybe I could be a real assassin.

23:52.113 --> 23:54.609
Do you know anything about
the four horsemen of the apocalypse?

23:54.734 --> 23:56.100
Yes, Dale, and I get it.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.228
I'm going to hell twice for being gay
and for having pre-marital sex.

23:59.396 --> 24:02.335
Hey, you know what?
If the U.S. Legalizes gay marriage

24:02.460 --> 24:05.234
and Grant and I get married,
am I safe on one of those?

24:05.678 --> 24:06.944
I had sex with Sheila.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.636
I was at that stupid party,

24:12.117 --> 24:14.992
and everybody was talking about the end
of the world and the apocalypse,

24:15.828 --> 24:18.372
and it was like
every easter Sunday back home.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.917
I was surrounded by all that partying.
I kept thinking,

24:21.086 --> 24:23.689
what if the world really does end?
I'd die a virgin.

24:24.291 --> 24:26.422
Did you ever have thoughts
like that before you had sex?

24:26.948 --> 24:29.581
And then I saw the four horsemen...
I thought it was the four horsemen.

24:29.706 --> 24:32.569
I realize now the more obvious
answer is it's probably just...

24:32.694 --> 24:34.771
mounted campus security and not...

24:34.896 --> 24:36.349
the sixth sign of the apocalypse.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.392
But, you know, I digress.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.974
And then I heard his voice...

24:40.099 --> 24:42.846
Well, q's voice...
telling me it was OK.

24:42.971 --> 24:45.636
So while you and Grant stayed back
at the party and boozed it up,

24:45.761 --> 24:48.389
me and Sheila came back here
and we did it.

24:49.486 --> 24:51.235
She was gone
before you even got back.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.117
No, it's OK.
I washed the sheets nine times today.

24:54.643 --> 24:55.643
But...

24:56.207 --> 24:58.708
The thing is,
it wasn't the horsemen or q

24:58.833 --> 25:01.058
or anybody else that made me do it.

25:01.183 --> 25:04.335
I think I was looking for any possible
reason to do it because I wanted to.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.935
And now I wish I wouldn't have
because sex changes everything

25:10.580 --> 25:12.580
and you cannot change it back.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.401
You tried that one already.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.403
This is taking forever.

25:33.155 --> 25:34.155
I got it!

25:36.481 --> 25:38.452
- Wait, I just...
- Yeah, now we gotta start over.

25:39.477 --> 25:40.371
Sorry.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.835
It's Jordan. She just texted me
to see how we're doing.

25:50.834 --> 25:52.975
So what happened with your grades?

25:53.808 --> 25:56.095
I don't know.
I guess I got a little distracted.

25:56.402 --> 25:57.638
You must really like her.

25:58.049 --> 25:59.299
Jordan's great.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.852
What I like most is the way I feel
when I'm with her.

26:04.014 --> 26:05.313
Do you mean sexually?

26:07.132 --> 26:08.508
Well, we haven't...

26:09.189 --> 26:12.278
- exactly...
- OK, no physical stuff.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.446
Sorry.

26:14.168 --> 26:15.732
Since we started dating,

26:16.304 --> 26:17.604
I kinda feel like that guy

26:17.738 --> 26:20.668
who doesn't have to think
about studying all the time.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.618
Like, I could just hang out
at the KT house

26:24.644 --> 26:26.834
with my arm around my girl.

26:27.884 --> 26:29.295
Just have fun, you know?

26:29.463 --> 26:30.421
And that's it.

26:30.905 --> 26:32.548
But you're not that guy.

26:34.058 --> 26:35.009
Thanks, Case.

26:36.034 --> 26:36.928
No, I mean...

26:37.877 --> 26:40.702
Any guy can be that guy.
You're the amalgam, remember?

26:40.827 --> 26:43.046
You can't give up one for the other.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.604
Like you gave up Max for Cappie.

26:47.238 --> 26:49.065
I didn't give up Max for Cappie.

26:50.029 --> 26:52.663
I just realized
he and I were too different.

26:57.963 --> 26:59.881
Are you bummed about Max?

27:01.541 --> 27:04.041
I really wanted it
to work out with us.

27:04.166 --> 27:05.400
He's a really...

27:05.824 --> 27:06.707
good guy.

27:08.124 --> 27:10.711
He did kind of leave
without saying goodbye, though.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.090
Well, sometimes guys leave, Rus.

27:13.774 --> 27:15.611
Sometimes they never show up.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.325
My nose.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.604
You guys know the windows
are open in here, right?

27:29.006 --> 27:30.006
Come on.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.083
{\pub}No killing till midnight.

27:53.483 --> 27:54.551
{\pos(192,220)}I need your help.

27:54.676 --> 27:57.216
{\pos(192,220)}Ashleigh saw the flowers
and got the impression that I liked you.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.350
You don't have to sound so grossed out
when you say that.

28:00.475 --> 28:02.824
So, she's coming here tonight
thinking that we like each other

28:02.949 --> 28:05.600
and this is our first date or something.
Help me, just for an hour or two.

28:08.085 --> 28:10.019
{\pos(192,220)}- What's in it for me?
- I already paid you once.

28:10.144 --> 28:12.736
{\pos(192,220)}You paid me for the flowers.
This is{\*completely} different. I'm spending

28:12.861 --> 28:15.026
{\pos(192,220)}an entire evening
when I could be hitting on other girls.

28:19.416 --> 28:20.469
{\pos(192,220)}I'll pay you

28:20.594 --> 28:22.557
because I, unlike you,
am not an insecure mess

28:22.682 --> 28:24.618
when it comes to flaunting my money.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.830
Sydney Bristow.
Great costume.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.876
And Evan, you're... wearing

28:32.044 --> 28:33.127
banana republic.

28:33.921 --> 28:34.920
I'm Jason Bourne.

28:36.420 --> 28:38.343
I'm not a big costume guy actually.

28:38.468 --> 28:41.124
You would've thought
for your own house's costume party

28:41.249 --> 28:44.096
you would've put forth a little
more effort, but whatever.

28:44.264 --> 28:47.308
- Fisher, this is Evan Chambers.
- Nice to meet you, man.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.101
- Yeah, you too.
- So...

28:49.269 --> 28:51.271
Rebecca told me
all about last night.

28:54.313 --> 28:57.347
- That was pretty crazy.
- {\To think }All that time you were with Frannie

28:57.472 --> 28:59.236
it was an attempt
to get closer to Rebecca.

28:59.767 --> 29:01.975
Makes more sense
than dating Frannie, I gotta say.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.401
- Pretty romantic, right?
- The secret notes,

29:04.526 --> 29:06.118
the longing, the subtext.

29:06.839 --> 29:09.705
Who knew all that time you {\guys }were talking
there was {\so much more }happening on your side?

29:09.873 --> 29:12.541
I keep replaying some
of the conversations you guys had

29:12.709 --> 29:14.832
and imagine them
with what I know now.

29:14.957 --> 29:17.389
<i>It's like watching the sixth sense
the second time.</i>

29:18.295 --> 29:19.715
I really don't know what to say.

29:25.365 --> 29:28.074
Let me know what I can do to help.
It's what I'm here for.

29:28.611 --> 29:29.611
Great.

29:31.357 --> 29:34.227
- Nice ninja costume, Cap.
- Thanks!

29:35.017 --> 29:37.039
I was gonna head
to the dead man's party tonight.

29:37.164 --> 29:39.470
- Thought it might come in handy.
- Speaking of parties,

29:39.595 --> 29:41.779
how was the rest of your night
last night?

29:42.240 --> 29:43.197
It was good.

29:43.773 --> 29:45.644
Ashleigh told me all about it.

29:45.769 --> 29:48.285
You know, the party...
and stuff.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.515
So, I know

29:50.414 --> 29:51.814
about the party...

29:52.663 --> 29:53.663
and stuff.

29:59.419 --> 30:01.165
Case, can you grab a clean beaker

30:01.290 --> 30:03.398
- from on top of the shelf?
- Yeah, sure.

30:06.698 --> 30:08.755
I just have to get this.

30:11.590 --> 30:15.146
So, this thing kind of
looks like a giant bong?

30:20.549 --> 30:21.277
Got it.

30:24.375 --> 30:26.949
- I'm a ninja.
- Case, can you quit messing around, OK?

30:28.646 --> 30:31.801
Case, I need a nitrogen bubbler.
It's labeled in the drawer over there.

30:32.846 --> 30:33.696
Bubbler?

30:33.821 --> 30:35.770
Are you sure
we're not making a bong?

30:36.476 --> 30:37.530
So what can I do?

30:37.655 --> 30:40.024
Chemistry's just like cooking, right?
I watch the food network.

30:40.149 --> 30:42.573
- I could be like your sous-scientist.
- But don't...

30:42.698 --> 30:45.686
Rusty, six hands
are better than four.

30:48.431 --> 30:51.526
Fine. All right. Cappie,
can you grab some hoses over there?

30:51.651 --> 30:55.186
I need two for the water and the reflux
condenser, one for the nitrogen bubbler.

30:55.552 --> 30:57.941
Then we plug them
into the valve right there.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.452
OK, I got it.

31:05.577 --> 31:06.325
See?

31:07.290 --> 31:09.533
I should totally switch my major.
This is so easy.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.929
Maybe I'll take up chemistry
next semester.

31:17.760 --> 31:18.793
I'm sorry.

31:24.959 --> 31:26.763
Case, can you grab
a nitrogen bubbler?

31:26.888 --> 31:28.488
Maybe I'll just stand guard,

31:28.613 --> 31:29.845
over here.

31:33.245 --> 31:35.645
I think there were
more parts to that.

31:38.629 --> 31:39.480
Pledges,

31:39.648 --> 31:42.098
- can you guys get me some water?
- OK, right away.

31:43.718 --> 31:44.696
Very cute.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.840
So how much longer do we need
to stay down here?

31:49.116 --> 31:52.163
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.
Maybe we should just wait a while.

31:52.487 --> 31:54.638
- Like a half-hour?
- Maybe longer.

31:55.387 --> 31:57.626
- Thirty-five minutes?
- I want to slow down.

31:58.038 --> 32:00.350
You know,
sex just changes everything.

32:00.475 --> 32:02.795
I'm enjoying right now,
just getting to know each other.

32:03.184 --> 32:05.631
And after we get bored with each other,
then we have sex?

32:06.927 --> 32:09.725
Can't believe I'm sneaking
around the house with a guy again.

32:10.321 --> 32:12.275
- Again?
- Calvin, here's your water.

32:27.783 --> 32:29.291
I think it's working.

32:29.416 --> 32:31.865
You're going through an awful
lot of trouble to keep this secret.

32:32.852 --> 32:35.619
Look, seriously, you can tell me.
Who'd you make out with last night?

32:36.458 --> 32:37.830
Not part of our deal, Bourne.

32:39.834 --> 32:42.001
Regret is a powerful emotion, huh?

32:42.354 --> 32:45.761
I'm starting to wonder if giving up my
money was that great of an idea myself.

32:46.890 --> 32:49.817
- You got to stand up to your parents.
- Yeah, but to what end?

32:50.422 --> 32:52.261
The money I have is gonna run out.

32:52.429 --> 32:53.956
I'm not gonna lie to you, Evan.

32:54.696 --> 32:56.473
From where I stand,
you are pretty screwed.

32:57.564 --> 32:58.812
I think we both are.

33:00.118 --> 33:01.562
So we'll be screwed together.

33:02.317 --> 33:04.440
So we can keep these secrets
just between us?

33:05.259 --> 33:06.200
Between us.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.365
- You suck!
- What?

33:14.107 --> 33:17.168
If all you're looking for
is a piece of ass, then forget it!

33:21.655 --> 33:23.907
I knew you would do something
to screw this up.

33:33.987 --> 33:36.513
I'm all finished. I just have to write
some of these results.

33:36.777 --> 33:38.647
- I can put stuff away?
- No.

33:39.434 --> 33:42.853
Come on! I said "I'm sorry" like
a thousand times. It was an accident.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.981
Did you "accidentally"
hit on Casey, too?

33:47.909 --> 33:50.235
When? I've been sitting
on this stool for almost two hours.

33:50.666 --> 33:52.077
Come on. Last night.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.156
Max told me everything.

33:55.975 --> 33:58.410
You admitted you weren't over casey,

33:58.578 --> 34:01.956
and then you pulled her into the closet
to try and win her back.

34:02.124 --> 34:05.084
For all the crap you gave me
for being a douche-mover with Jordan?

34:05.324 --> 34:07.586
At least I felt terrible
for what I did.

34:07.754 --> 34:10.755
You, you've been acting like
you didn't do anything wrong all day.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.243
I'm sorry.

34:12.699 --> 34:15.563
- You're right, I'm a douche-mover.
- Stop! Cappie didn't...

34:16.859 --> 34:19.858
... hit on me. He didn't pull me
into the closet. I pulled him in

34:20.188 --> 34:22.956
and told him that I wanted
to get back together with him.

34:23.719 --> 34:25.059
And he turned me down.

34:27.585 --> 34:29.601
Cappie and I
aren't getting together.

34:34.217 --> 34:35.036
Are we?

34:42.496 --> 34:44.039
Crap! That's the leak detector.

34:44.164 --> 34:46.072
I forgot to turn off the gas!
We gotta go!

34:46.197 --> 34:47.292
Case, come on!

34:49.540 --> 34:50.754
No, just leave it.

34:57.338 --> 34:59.025
- Let's go out the side door.
- OK.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.086
Is that it?

35:18.683 --> 35:19.908
{\pos(192,210)}This can't be good.

35:25.255 --> 35:27.630
You two go back into the lab
and leave out the window.

35:28.099 --> 35:29.533
What are you going to do?

35:30.133 --> 35:31.648
I'm gonna do what I do best.

35:33.576 --> 35:35.090
Test tubes, not bunnies.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.383
What the hell?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.677
I'm a ninja
for the ethical treatment of animals.

35:39.336 --> 35:40.262
N.E.T.A?

35:40.530 --> 35:42.093
Not one of you guys again.

35:42.218 --> 35:45.267
Look, there are no animals
in this building.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.289
Really? Then where are they?

35:48.842 --> 35:52.524
Did you know there are more animals used
for testing than there are in the world?

35:53.346 --> 35:55.611
{\pos(192,210)}Well, that doesn't sound accurate.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.737
{\pos(192,210)}Well... OK.

35:58.865 --> 35:59.589
{\pos(192,210)}Cool.

36:04.529 --> 36:05.996
{\pos(192,210)}Hugs, not drugs!

36:06.433 --> 36:08.123
{\pos(192,210)}Hugs, not drugs!

36:12.663 --> 36:14.488
Well, Dale,
you'll be interested to know

36:14.613 --> 36:17.143
that grant and I have decided
to hold off on having sex.

36:17.889 --> 36:19.648
I'm actually not that interested.

36:20.908 --> 36:21.859
Thanks, Dale.

36:22.172 --> 36:23.006
So...

36:23.481 --> 36:24.389
How are you?

36:24.929 --> 36:28.062
You know, I've done a lot of thinking,
a lot of soul searching, and...

36:28.492 --> 36:30.997
I think I've come to terms
with my relationship with Sheila.

36:31.241 --> 36:32.575
I know what to do now.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.533
That'd be her.

36:38.199 --> 36:40.081
- Hey.
- Hi, Dale.

36:41.315 --> 36:42.422
Hi, Dale's friend.

36:45.058 --> 36:47.788
I gave you my virginity and now
I need to give you something else.

36:50.311 --> 36:52.089
I think we need to get married now.

36:52.699 --> 36:55.045
It's just my class ring.
I'm gonna have to ask money

36:55.213 --> 36:57.096
from my parents
to buy a real one, but...

37:02.609 --> 37:03.929
Dale, that is so sweet.

37:04.872 --> 37:06.557
And last night was really...

37:07.368 --> 37:08.264
Special.

37:08.496 --> 37:12.246
And you're a great tenant, but,
I've been really busy with work.

37:12.741 --> 37:14.481
I might have to tend building C

37:14.649 --> 37:17.401
and I have to go to tucson next week
and then there's my cat.

37:18.975 --> 37:22.406
So I will totally call you
when things slow down, OK?

37:37.161 --> 37:39.047
Hey! How'd it go with hastings?

37:39.448 --> 37:41.331
My D is officially a C.

37:42.321 --> 37:45.304
Wait, that's it? After everything
you had to do last night?

37:45.760 --> 37:47.176
It's good enough for now.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.259
Thank you for calling
in reinforcements last night.

37:50.650 --> 37:51.855
You kinda saved me.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.099
You have passion for what you do.
I think it's great.

37:55.546 --> 37:58.429
Honestly I'm kind of jealous,
'cause I probably would've blown it off.

37:59.231 --> 38:00.277
I have to warn you.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.269
I might not continue to be

38:02.394 --> 38:05.657
the cool fraternity guy
that you know and love.

38:06.476 --> 38:07.201
Like,

38:07.846 --> 38:08.783
I mean.

38:09.106 --> 38:11.455
You might have to share me
with engineering for a while.

38:12.395 --> 38:14.296
Sounds like a hot three-way.

38:18.048 --> 38:20.002
So, Becca and Evan?

38:20.507 --> 38:23.291
Yeah, it's weird, the fact
she wanted to keep it a secret.

38:23.416 --> 38:26.213
She didn't feel the need to be discreet
last time they hooked up.

38:26.589 --> 38:28.642
- People change.
- Totally.

38:29.039 --> 38:30.000
Like Cappie.

38:30.251 --> 38:31.886
I really thought he'd come around.

38:32.011 --> 38:34.345
Yeah, after all the back and forth.

38:35.063 --> 38:38.389
I can't hardly blame him.
I spent two years telling him "No."

38:39.242 --> 38:40.934
Couldn't expect him to wait forever.

38:43.027 --> 38:44.154
- Case.
- What?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.532
<i>You have felt the love inside</i>

38:47.700 --> 38:49.318
<i>But now that...</i>

38:49.443 --> 38:50.691
- Stop singing.
- Why?

38:50.816 --> 38:53.216
I'm getting to the
"Meow Kitty Meow-Meow" chorus.

39:00.066 --> 39:02.169
- I'll see you at the house.
- OK. Thanks, Ash.

39:08.129 --> 39:09.092
Nice vest.

39:10.818 --> 39:12.266
Seems to bring out my eyes, huh?

39:14.013 --> 39:15.346
That was pretty great,

39:15.640 --> 39:16.937
what you did last night.

39:17.749 --> 39:19.200
It was the least I could do.

39:19.325 --> 39:21.253
I wasn't gonna help him
with the chemistry.

39:21.378 --> 39:23.318
Now I know how rusty feels
at a date function.

39:29.163 --> 39:30.659
- Listen...
- You know...

39:31.593 --> 39:34.830
I think the answer's
pretty clear about us.

39:35.379 --> 39:36.164
You know.

39:36.835 --> 39:37.978
I felt so lame.

39:38.527 --> 39:41.415
Yesterday I actually thought
you might change your mind

39:41.540 --> 39:43.439
and come for me
in some grand movie moment

39:43.564 --> 39:46.675
that only exists in the deranged mind
of Nora Ephron.

39:47.432 --> 39:48.989
Like I said, lame.

39:49.717 --> 39:50.580
Anyway,

39:51.443 --> 39:52.922
guess I'll see you around.

39:55.284 --> 39:56.393
Around it is.

39:59.856 --> 40:00.842
Hey, Cap?

40:06.955 --> 40:07.919
Gotcha.

40:26.489 --> 40:28.068
What the hell am I waiting for?

40:34.558 --> 40:36.566
Hey, Beaver, have you seen Casey?

40:36.691 --> 40:38.483
- Where's Casey?
- Like, recently?

40:40.313 --> 40:41.605
Whoa there, numbnuts.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.632
I'm celebrating
my independence today, man.

40:43.757 --> 40:46.026
- Come celebrate with me.
- Actually, I gotta go.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.748
Wait! It's 1:00 in the morning.
Where do you have to be right now?

40:48.873 --> 40:51.114
No one's looking.
They're all too drunk to care.

40:51.822 --> 40:52.908
Speaking of drunk,

40:53.260 --> 40:56.137
I had the distinct displeasure

40:56.262 --> 40:59.206
of watching casey's enginerd

40:59.374 --> 41:02.834
actually puke into a coat pocket.

41:03.137 --> 41:05.962
- It was amazing.
- Ex-enginerd. They broke up tonight.

41:07.597 --> 41:08.789
That's too bad.

41:09.641 --> 41:12.598
I thought they kinda made sense.
He seemed really good for her,

41:12.935 --> 41:15.263
something that you and I
definitely were not.

41:16.453 --> 41:19.184
- Why do you say that?
- I don't know why you still care.

41:21.551 --> 41:24.231
- Please, tell me you aren't...
- Aren't what?

41:25.058 --> 41:26.720
No, for a second I thought you were

41:26.845 --> 41:29.152
heading out to pay a visit
to the ZBZ house.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.338
- So what if I was?
- Well, they just broke up.

41:31.463 --> 41:33.508
It's not like that, OK?
It's this whole thing.

41:33.633 --> 41:35.092
A few weeks ago, I told...

41:36.107 --> 41:38.959
I told her that I still had feelings
for her, but she was with Max.

41:39.084 --> 41:41.540
And we agreed we couldn't be friends
because I need to move on,

41:41.708 --> 41:43.392
and I was moving on...

41:43.517 --> 41:45.722
Yeah,
I'm tired just listening to it.

41:45.847 --> 41:48.705
Aren't you tired? Do you really want
to get back into that?

41:48.830 --> 41:50.799
Look, you don't know
what you're talking about.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.718
You obviously have no intention

41:53.912 --> 41:56.566
of ever graduating
and leaving this place.

41:56.877 --> 41:58.796
It's her senior year, man.

41:58.982 --> 42:02.135
Casey thinks about the future.
How's that gonna work out?

42:05.657 --> 42:07.864
I have no ulterior motive here.

42:09.502 --> 42:10.838
We're friends, aren't we?

42:11.187 --> 42:13.405
Amphora brethren? Kha'y?

42:13.928 --> 42:15.613
Kha'y, Bing!

42:16.794 --> 42:19.820
Look, all I'm saying is you know
how it felt to lose her once.

42:20.164 --> 42:22.129
You really want to go
through that again?

42:24.717 --> 42:26.626
Come on, man.
Come on, let's grab a beer.

42:26.794 --> 42:27.870
And sleep on it.

42:27.995 --> 42:30.120
If you wake up
and feel the same tomorrow,

42:30.729 --> 42:31.798
I can't stop you.

42:45.105 --> 42:46.091
Hey, wait up.

42:56.338 --> 42:57.765
You're a good kisser.

43:00.179 --> 43:01.482
What are we doing?
