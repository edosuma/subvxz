00:40.040 --> 00:42.565
Dancing is cool.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.270
Check it out, y'all.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.210
Ah!

00:47.280 --> 00:49.874
This one is called
"The Worm."

00:54.054 --> 00:55.885
Aaaaaaah!

00:58.892 --> 01:00.052
Ack! Ack! Ack!

01:00.126 --> 01:02.219
Aaaaah!

01:19.245 --> 01:21.509
Oh, no.
It's crazy-far.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.620
Okay.
Now easy does it.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.679
Easy...
easy...

01:30.757 --> 01:32.054
Hey, man!
It's safe in here!

01:32.125 --> 01:33.752
- Eeeee...
- You can hide in here!

01:33.827 --> 01:35.488
Oh. Shoot, man.
Uh-oh.

01:35.562 --> 01:36.756
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

01:36.830 --> 01:37.922
Ee-ee-ee-ee!

01:37.997 --> 01:39.692
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

01:39.766 --> 01:41.063
Ugh!

01:41.134 --> 01:43.830
Ugh.
Oh, no! My face!

01:43.903 --> 01:45.427
Finn! Jake!

01:45.505 --> 01:47.496
Kiss my face!

01:49.042 --> 01:51.374
Ohh.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.878
So, this is the pits.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.381
I hear that, friend.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.917
Do you mind if I wallow
with you a bit?

01:58.985 --> 02:00.816
I'm a bubble.

02:00.887 --> 02:03.151
Okay.
Nothing stopping a bubble.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.214
That's what they say.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.282
Looks like you've given up
on things.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.828
I'm thinking about giving up
on things myself.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.524
I've been lost in this
wilderness a long time.

02:12.599 --> 02:16.057
Maybe we can wait here...
to get eaten by a carnivore.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.797
No, Bubble.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.896
I know two heroes
who can help you.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.804
- You do?
- Yes.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.435
Help me get to <i>my</i> home and...

02:24.511 --> 02:26.502
and we will help you
find <i>your</i> home.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.012
Your friends sound great!

02:28.081 --> 02:29.981
They are! They are huge!

02:30.049 --> 02:32.017
Well, then, what are we
waiting for?

02:32.085 --> 02:34.417
Nothi-i-i-i-ng!

02:36.122 --> 02:39.853
Hey, so, tell me
about your home, BMO.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.121
I live in a tree house.
Unh!

02:42.195 --> 02:44.390
It's really funny.
- Cool.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.591
Yeah. Oof!
What about <i>your</i> home?

02:46.666 --> 02:47.724
My home?

02:47.800 --> 02:51.793
I <i>think</i> that my home is very
large and very beautiful,

02:51.871 --> 02:54.465
but I can't pin down
these memories.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.975
It...
haunts me.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.601
Oops!

02:58.678 --> 03:01.875
I wasn't listening
to your story.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.120
What was that?

03:10.657 --> 03:13.091
It's a carnivore
waiting to eat us!

03:13.159 --> 03:14.956
- No!!
- Don't worry, Bubble.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.996
I've got everything
under control.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.792
Ugh! Ehh.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.400
It's a baby!

03:23.469 --> 03:25.664
What's a baby doing
in the wilderness?

03:25.738 --> 03:28.172
He must be lost...
like us!

03:28.241 --> 03:30.004
We should take him with us.

03:30.076 --> 03:32.670
Maybe we can help him
find his home, too.

03:32.745 --> 03:35.213
What a handsome baby.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.645
Handsome baby.

03:43.523 --> 03:46.515
Bubble, what do you think
our baby's name is?

03:46.593 --> 03:48.823
How about...
Sparkle?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.693
No, I think he looks
like a Ricky.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.026
Hmm.

03:53.099 --> 03:55.294
Oh! Bubble! Ricky! Look!

04:00.840 --> 04:02.330
I have bad news.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.399
The bridge doesn't have
guardrails.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.207
I don't think we should
cross it, then.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.016
I don't think we have
any choice!

04:12.085 --> 04:14.383
I'm sure that really <i>is</i>
a carnivore this time!

04:14.454 --> 04:16.319
Ricky, you should go first!

04:18.190 --> 04:20.682
You are so beautiful, and...

04:20.760 --> 04:21.784
I love you.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.556
Go, Ricky!

04:24.998 --> 04:27.796
Okay, Ricky,
slow and steady!

04:28.968 --> 04:31.027
Ricky? Ricky!

04:31.104 --> 04:33.163
Ricky!!
- Sparkle!!

04:34.407 --> 04:36.102
Bravery!

04:36.175 --> 04:39.576
Oh, n-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

04:42.515 --> 04:44.710
One second, sweetie!

04:44.784 --> 04:45.944
Hmm.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.180
A deadly waterfall!

04:50.256 --> 04:51.587
BMO!

04:51.658 --> 04:53.888
Bubble!
You have to save our lives!

04:53.960 --> 04:55.325
Ohh...

04:55.395 --> 04:57.989
maybe I can hold out
this leaf.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.613
Thank you, Bubble!

05:17.684 --> 05:19.345
I think my batteries
are wet.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.546
Goodbye.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.731
Good morning, everyone.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.635
I didn't have any dreams.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.907
He looks fussy.
Maybe he's hungry.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.313
My hungry baby.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.409
What am I going to do
with you?

05:55.688 --> 05:57.383
Potato.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.849
Eat your potato, Ricky.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.055
It's the carnivore!

06:07.133 --> 06:09.761
Everybody! Hide!

06:09.836 --> 06:12.771
Psst! Ricky! Please! Hide!

06:14.907 --> 06:17.034
Ugh! Ungh!

06:19.812 --> 06:21.507
Oh, Ricky!
Ungh!

06:21.581 --> 06:23.515
Help me out here!

06:29.922 --> 06:32.152
My baby!

06:33.659 --> 06:36.651
I was so worried about you,
Sparkle.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.026
Sparkle.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.223
- No!
- Hey!

06:39.298 --> 06:40.788
Ricky, no!
No, no, no!

06:40.867 --> 06:42.357
No! No!

06:42.435 --> 06:45.097
BMO, that's his mom!
Let go!

06:45.171 --> 06:47.105
Ehh...

06:47.173 --> 06:49.664
My beautiful baby.

06:52.311 --> 06:56.111
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

07:03.623 --> 07:05.818
Vro-o-o-o-om!

07:05.892 --> 07:07.257
Zo-o-o-om!

07:07.326 --> 07:10.352
Sho-o-o-om!
Hey!

07:10.430 --> 07:12.421
The path ahead
looks pretty clear.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.159
And there were these...

07:14.233 --> 07:16.292
uh, there...

07:16.369 --> 07:18.303
BMO? Are you okay?

07:18.371 --> 07:21.898
I am sad, Bubble.
I miss baby Ricky.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.306
I miss him so much already.

07:24.377 --> 07:27.278
And I miss Finn,
and I miss Jake.

07:27.346 --> 07:30.713
And I got dirt all in my
butt circuits.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.479
And, Bubble...
- Yes, BMO?

07:33.553 --> 07:37.319
I-I don't think I'm ever
gonna get home again!

07:38.591 --> 07:39.751
Don't cry.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.421
Sparkle is safe now,
and <i>we</i> did that.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.521
Thanks to us,
he's gonna grow up

07:45.598 --> 07:47.759
to be anything
he wants to be...

07:47.834 --> 07:50.325
a strapping horse whisperer

07:50.403 --> 07:52.735
or a sexy hit man
or whatever.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.636
And things are looking up
for us, too.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.868
I saw some bugs up ahead
who look pretty with it.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.709
Maybe they can give us
directions or something.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.838
Oh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh! Oh! Oh, Bubble!

08:01.914 --> 08:04.474
- What?
- I know those guys, Bubble!

08:04.550 --> 08:07.041
Those are my homeboys...
my homeboys!

08:07.119 --> 08:08.552
Those are my homeboys!

08:08.621 --> 08:10.088
We are close to my home!

08:10.156 --> 08:12.249
Yay!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.451
Come on, BMO!

08:13.526 --> 08:15.517
Yay! Oof!

08:16.562 --> 08:17.494
Yay!

08:19.031 --> 08:21.363
Yay!

08:21.434 --> 08:22.958
It's been so long!

08:23.035 --> 08:25.265
I can't wait to have some
bread and butter!

08:33.446 --> 08:35.971
Jake? Is that you at the door?

08:36.048 --> 08:37.037
No, man.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.947
I'm in the kitchen,
making us breakfast.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.543
I call
not-answer-the-door, then.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.952
Oh, all right!

08:43.022 --> 08:45.513
Hang on out there.
I'm coming.

08:45.591 --> 08:46.990
Whoop!
Whoa!

08:47.059 --> 08:49.027
Argh! Agh!

08:49.095 --> 08:50.084
Whoa!

08:50.162 --> 08:52.062
Yaaaaaaaah!

08:52.131 --> 08:53.325
Might be a minute.

08:55.067 --> 08:58.628
Um, hey, so, BMO,
since we have a little time,

08:58.704 --> 09:00.604
there's something I've been
wanting to say.

09:00.673 --> 09:01.503
Huh?

09:01.574 --> 09:04.941
I know I might never find
my <i>real</i> home.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.002
No, Bubble!
That's not true!

09:07.079 --> 09:09.639
It is.
I know it is.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.580
But it's... it's okay.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.585
Because I realized something.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.518
All this time we've been
together, BMO,

09:15.588 --> 09:19.354
I haven't <i>felt</i> lost.
I've felt at home.

09:19.425 --> 09:21.416
Yaaaaaaaah!

09:21.494 --> 09:24.657
And it's <i>you,</i> BMO,
I feel at home with.

09:25.698 --> 09:29.134
So, I thought... I mean,
if you feel the same way...

09:29.201 --> 09:31.795
I thought we could...
get married.

09:31.871 --> 09:35.864
I-I mean, I'm not even sure what
that means exactly, but...

09:35.942 --> 09:37.068
I do!

09:37.143 --> 09:38.610
Oh, I do! I do!

09:38.678 --> 09:40.771
Oh!

09:40.846 --> 09:42.438
- Whoooooo!
- Hey, a Bubble!

09:42.515 --> 09:43.675
Pop!

09:43.749 --> 09:45.740
Bubble? Bubble?!

09:45.818 --> 09:49.618
No! No, no, no!
My bubble! No!

09:49.689 --> 09:51.418
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's just BMO.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.390
He's pretending to be
all messed up

09:53.459 --> 09:54.983
'cause his bubble got popped.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.559
Ohhh.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.292
That <i>is</i> pretty funny!

10:00.366 --> 10:02.926
Oh, Bubble, I'm so sorry
I brought you here.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.569
<i>There, there, BMO. It's okay.</i>

10:08.641 --> 10:11.201
Bubble? Is that you?

10:11.277 --> 10:14.144
I hear you in my head,
but I don't see you.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.977
Oh, no. Have I gone bananas?

10:17.049 --> 10:19.074
<i>No, BMO. It's okay.</i>

10:19.151 --> 10:21.210
<i>You see, I'm finally free.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:23.152
I don't understand, Bubble.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.588
<i>No, not Bubble.</i>

10:25.658 --> 10:28.718
<i>Air.</i>
<i>BMO, I'm Air!</i>

10:28.794 --> 10:31.786
<i>I'd been trapped in that bubble</i>
<i>for so long,</i>

10:31.864 --> 10:34.697
<i>I'd forgotten who I am.</i>

10:34.767 --> 10:37.099
<i>But now I'm finally home.</i>

10:37.169 --> 10:38.693
Yay!

10:38.771 --> 10:40.705
Oh. B-But wait.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.331
Now you don't need me...

10:42.408 --> 10:43.932
to feel...
at home.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.173
<i>No.</i>
<i>See, that's what's so great.</i>

10:47.246 --> 10:50.875
<i>Now we can be together forever,</i>
<i>BMO</i>

10:50.950 --> 10:53.578
<i>every minute</i>
<i>of every day.</i>

10:53.653 --> 10:55.917
<i>No more privacy.</i>

10:55.988 --> 10:58.980
<i>No more quiet.</i>
<i>No more alone.</i>

10:59.058 --> 11:03.427
<i>Every room you ever go in,</i>
<i>I'll already be there...</i>

11:03.496 --> 11:04.827
<i>waiting...</i>

11:04.897 --> 11:07.491
<i>forever and ever...</i>

11:07.566 --> 11:10.660
<i>until the end of time.</i>
