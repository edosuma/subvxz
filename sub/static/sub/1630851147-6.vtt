<i>Time.</i>

00:46.541 --> 00:47.750
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.291 --> 00:50.291
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:55.250
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.833 --> 01:04.666
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility.</i>

01:06.875 --> 01:10.750
<i>Where a single choice can branch out</i>
<i>into infinite realities,</i>

01:13.083 --> 01:16.208
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>

01:19.875 --> 01:21.625
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.583 --> 01:26.458
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.291 --> 01:29.625
<i>Follow me</i>

01:30.125 --> 01:31.958
<i>and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.291 --> 01:36.750
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:44.458 --> 01:46.125
<i>Every journey has a beginning,</i>

01:46.958 --> 01:49.666
but change one step along the way,

01:49.750 --> 01:53.458
and you could end up at a very
different destination.

01:57.208 --> 01:58.791
Come on. It's okay. Laugh. Hey!

01:58.875 --> 02:00.875
Is it cool
if I take a picture with you?

02:00.958 --> 02:04.000
Yes, it's very cool.
Please, no gang signs.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.375
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.458
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.333
Contact left!

02:13.125 --> 02:14.833
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

02:16.875 --> 02:19.125
-Wait, wait, wait. Give me a gun.
-Stay here.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.750
That was a spectacular
entrance, seriously.

02:44.833 --> 02:47.208
The Ten Rings have reinforcements
en route. Let's move.

02:47.291 --> 02:50.583
Fine by me, Lieutenant Killmonger?
What is that?

02:50.666 --> 02:51.916
-German?
-A nickname.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.666
That's clearly a good fit.
I see where they got it.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.666
Uh, what's your afternoon like?

03:03.916 --> 03:07.500
Heroes are not born,
they're forged in darkness.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.041
<i>Shaped in battle.</i>

03:16.833 --> 03:18.833
<i>Defined by sacrifice.</i>

03:18.916 --> 03:22.125
And I am Iron Man.

03:23.458 --> 03:26.708
Without Tony Stark's
fateful capture in Afghanistan,

03:26.791 --> 03:30.208
the Age of Iron Man
would never come to pass.

03:30.625 --> 03:33.875
<i>Though the man was saved, a hero was lost,</i>

03:33.958 --> 03:35.958
<i>and a villain was given a new chance.</i>

03:36.291 --> 03:38.208
Mr. Stark, were you injured in the attack?

03:38.291 --> 03:41.166
No, but I did spill my drink,
and it was a '26 Macallan,

03:41.250 --> 03:43.625
so I'm pretty sure that's a war crime.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.916
Excuse me, sir.
Harry Whittington, <i>British Post.</i>

03:46.000 --> 03:48.416
Did you learn any lessons
from your time in Afghanistan?

03:48.500 --> 03:51.291
I did. Never travel anywhere that
doesn't have a Four Seasons.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.458
Mr. Stark,
has this experience changed you?

03:55.541 --> 03:59.791
Well, I saw young Americans
killed by the very weapons I created

03:59.875 --> 04:05.041
to protect them. And I realized
we have to do better,

04:05.125 --> 04:08.083
build bigger, and fight badder for them.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.333
Which is why I'm bringing in
Lieutenant Erik Stevens,

04:11.416 --> 04:13.333
the Navy SEAL who saved my life,

04:13.416 --> 04:16.916
as Stark Industries'
new chief security officer.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.541
This a load of bull.
That was supposed to be my promotion.

04:23.541 --> 04:25.708
All right! Tony's back, huh?

04:25.958 --> 04:27.875
Lieutenant. Lieutenant.
Christine Everhart.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.166
I think we're done here.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.583
What is it you were doing
in the Kunar province?

04:31.666 --> 04:33.833
Uh, saving me.
Pretty sure we went over this.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.291
It's just strange.
Since on the day of the attack,

04:36.375 --> 04:38.666
his unit was stationed 400 klicks away.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.791
If you're trying to imply that he had
advanced knowledge of the attack...

04:41.875 --> 04:45.291
She'd be right. I uncovered plans
to assassinate Tony Stark

04:45.375 --> 04:47.625
while on a deep cover operation
inside the Ten Rings.

04:47.708 --> 04:50.833
Whoa! Whoa!
Well, there you have it, folks.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.083
That's going to be a wrap
on this conversation.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.041
Yeah. Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

04:55.125 --> 04:59.250
Because those plans were bankrolled
by Stark Industry COO Obadiah Stane.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.333
Tony, I...

05:02.416 --> 05:05.833
I don't know
what this kid's talking about.

05:05.916 --> 05:07.958
Let's get outta here
and work through this.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.833
No, no, don't you worry about that.
I brought receipts.

05:10.916 --> 05:13.875
Wire transfers, bank documents,
phone records.

05:13.958 --> 05:15.708
Google it. I just dropped it all online.

05:17.416 --> 05:18.416
I knew it.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.041
Tony...

05:20.125 --> 05:21.916
You son of a... Security!

05:22.000 --> 05:23.291
Oh, man.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.666
Ah. I never liked that guy.

05:31.583 --> 05:36.250
I'll say this for the new guy,
he certainly makes for good TV. Right?

05:36.791 --> 05:39.500
Terrorists, corporate raiders,
<i>Maxim</i> cover models.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.208
What do they all have in common?

05:41.291 --> 05:43.458
-They came for the king.
-And they missed.

05:43.541 --> 05:44.541
I owe it all to you.

05:44.625 --> 05:49.791
And that's why I want you by my side
24-7 as my new COO.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.791
Wait. You're giving him Obadiah's job?

05:51.875 --> 05:54.708
Damn, I don't know, Mr. Stark.
I think I'm more of a soldier.

05:54.791 --> 05:58.125
Which is why it's perfect.
You, me. We'll be like Butch and Sundance.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.541
-They died at the end, Tony.
-Okay, bad example.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.875
Fact remains, I need a killer.
Figurative one, of course.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.333
But, hey, a literal one can't hurt either.

06:08.125 --> 06:09.958
-To killers.
-Yeah.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.375
You're Butch. I'm Sundance.
Just so we're clear.

06:14.625 --> 06:20.458
So, Colonel Rhodes, what can you tell me
about our knight in shining camouflage?

06:20.958 --> 06:24.333
Graduated Annapolis at 19,
MIT a year later.

06:24.416 --> 06:26.708
Made quite a name for himself
since joining the SEALs

06:26.791 --> 06:30.416
as part of an elite ghost squad
that specializes in high-target wetwork.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.541
-Please tell me that's plumbing.
-Assassinations.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.500
Jeez. Glad I asked for clarification.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.875
I'd say he's done pretty good
for a kid from Oakland.

06:36.958 --> 06:40.041
I mean, what's your concern, Pepper?
Other than the killing part.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.916
Lot of people come around looking to get
their moment in the sun with Tony Stark,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.500
and it's my job to sniff out
exactly what it is they want with him.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.166
-And what do you smell?
-Nothing.

06:49.500 --> 06:53.291
And that's the problem.
Everyone wants something.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.083
Welcome to Candy Land.
I built everything in here myself.

07:00.166 --> 07:02.625
Well, except for the Lambo.
That's 3D printed.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.208
Oh, man. Repulsor tech?

07:04.291 --> 07:07.000
Trying to miniaturize the Jericho
into a portable firearm.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.083
Bet she pops.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.250
Easy, killer. I come in peace.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.625
What did your old man used to say?
Ah. That's right.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.166
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

07:16.208 --> 07:18.041
Hey, play nice. He's a friend.

07:18.125 --> 07:21.333
Lot of good it did dear old Dad.
What about you?

07:21.416 --> 07:23.291
-You close with yours?
-Nah.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.833
He died, too. Gang violence.

07:27.708 --> 07:32.250
Weapons in the wrong hands.
Wish no one had to fire them at all.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.625
For real. Then again...

07:36.416 --> 07:38.291
-Ah, forget it.
-What?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.708
It's just my doctoral thesis.

07:39.791 --> 07:42.375
I developed plans
for an automated combat drone.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.708
Thought I was going to make
human soldiers obsolete.

07:44.791 --> 07:46.791
But I could never crack the interface.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.791
'Cause you didn't have me. Let's do this.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.500
Let's build your science fair project.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.708
You saved my life.
I'd like to return the favor.

07:54.458 --> 07:57.208
Jarvis, search the MIT
doctoral thesis database.

07:57.291 --> 07:58.791
-Project...
-Liberator.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.000
You've got an ear for branding.
I'll give you that.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.666
Wow. Uh, bold design choice.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.375
What? I like anime.

08:07.458 --> 08:11.041
Worst-case scenario, we'll end up with
the world's most expensive Gundam model.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.625
Jarvis, case the warehouse.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.291
We're gonna need FPV wiring,
nanocircuitry,

08:15.375 --> 08:17.833
and Bloody Marys.
Hangover's starting to kick in.

08:44.125 --> 08:47.291
Human pilots mean human error,
but with Jarvis at the wheel,

08:47.375 --> 08:52.125
drones can react to stimuli in real-time
and no one needs to lift a finger.

08:53.958 --> 08:58.250
<i>Operations test.</i>
<i>Stark Liberator drone mark one, showtime.</i>

09:02.583 --> 09:04.375
<i>It's only a failure if it explodes.</i>

09:05.208 --> 09:06.666
<i>Okay, that changes things.</i>

09:07.250 --> 09:10.250
<i>It appears the drone's regulating</i>
<i>processor is over-clocked.</i>

09:10.333 --> 09:12.708
You know, we need another power source.

09:12.791 --> 09:18.041
Hey. Hey. If we could
miniaturize an arc reactor...

09:18.166 --> 09:20.750
-No, that's a dumb idea.
-What we need is Vibranium.

09:20.833 --> 09:23.666
With the right juice, it can act
as a self-sustaining energy source.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.500
Yeah. Now you're thinking.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.750
Too bad Pops used up the last of it
during the war.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.708
Hmm. Not all of it.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.583
Where did you get this?

09:40.666 --> 09:42.791
This kind of stuff pops up
all over the globe.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.208
You need the right hook up.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.125
I might have just the guy.

09:46.208 --> 09:50.125
Ulysses Klaue? No, Tony. Absolutely not.

09:50.208 --> 09:52.708
Are you allowed to say that
to people in my tax bracket?

09:52.791 --> 09:54.208
Tony, in case you forgot,

09:54.291 --> 09:58.375
Stark Industries doesn't fraternize
with black market arms dealers.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.416
-She's right, Tony. I agree.
-Wait. What?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.708
Things go south,
shareholders are gonna flip.

10:02.791 --> 10:04.750
Unless we secure
some kind of diplomatic cover.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.791
We send Rhodey. There.
He's U.S. Air Force,

10:06.875 --> 10:09.708
and he's the company's military liaison.
We are all aboveboard.

10:09.791 --> 10:11.500
I think that's a great idea.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.625
Excellent. I's dotted, T's crossed.
Pep, drop the purchase order.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.416
Break out the fine China.

10:22.500 --> 10:26.000
Not every day the Americans get down
in the muck with the likes of me.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.833
Can't clean up the world
without getting your hands dirty.

10:29.041 --> 10:32.416
Oh! That is good.
You should stitch that on a pillow.

10:32.541 --> 10:34.583
<i>Ugh!</i>
<i>This guy will run his mouth all day.</i>

10:34.666 --> 10:36.250
<i>Tell him you want to see the product.</i>

10:36.333 --> 10:37.916
So, about that Vibranium?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.375
Oh. Oh. No foreplay, eh?

10:41.458 --> 10:44.333
You know what?
It's a waste of time anyway.

10:45.583 --> 10:48.958
Dora Milaje spear.

10:49.041 --> 10:52.375
Bought it off the black market
for ten mil. Steep, I know. But...

10:52.458 --> 10:56.041
Please, Tony spends $10 million
on a slow Tuesday in Vegas.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.375
Good.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.875
Now that I know you mean business,
we can move on to the good stuff.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.291
Uh...

11:10.625 --> 11:12.041
Where did you find all this?

11:13.083 --> 11:15.458
What's going on here? We've been breached.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.166
Find them and light them up.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.625
Killmonger, you got eyes on this?
Killmonger!

11:25.333 --> 11:27.041
Sector four to sector one.

11:28.666 --> 11:29.916
Sector four to sector one.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Killmonger, on comms.
Are you seeing this?

12:05.375 --> 12:07.500
Our quarrel is not with you, Colonel.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.916
Oh, really? 'Cause you're sending me
mixed messages.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.541
Let me take the Vibranium
back where it belongs.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.416
Sorry, cuz.
That's ain't gonna fly.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.250
Really wish it didn't have
to go down like this.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.833
Stark R and D is no joke.
The sonic taser thing is legit.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.041
But this...

12:46.375 --> 12:48.708
-This I'm really feeling.
-Erik, why?

12:50.416 --> 12:53.458
Better question. Why wear the uniform
of your own oppressors?

12:53.541 --> 12:55.708
Fight for them? Die for them?

12:55.791 --> 13:00.750
Kid, you've gotta be part of the system
to change the system.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.958
Nah. You can burn it down.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.208
Ooh!

13:12.291 --> 13:16.458
My, my, my. I would not want to play chess
with you, my friend.

13:16.541 --> 13:20.041
I leaked word of the sale
to the Wakandan War Dogs.

13:20.125 --> 13:23.916
And it all played out
just as you predicted it would.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.708
We better load up the product.
The Dora'll be here soon.

13:55.375 --> 13:59.958
T'<i>We will not sit idly by</i>
<i>while our resources are pillaged,</i>

14:00.041 --> 14:03.958
<i>our people killed at the hands</i>
<i>of American imperialists.</i>

14:04.041 --> 14:06.291
Hey, Tony.
Brought you a souvenir.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.375
What, airport gift shop out of Toblerones?

14:09.458 --> 14:10.875
So you've been watching the news?

14:10.958 --> 14:13.333
We lost one of our own.
Let's show the world who's boss.

14:13.791 --> 14:15.958
And just who is the boss, Lieutenant?

14:16.041 --> 14:18.000
Last I checked,
your name's on the building.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.125
And the paper trail.
You certainly saw to that.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.416
But not to everything.

14:27.708 --> 14:31.416
Word to the wise. Never play Clue
with Jarvis. He sees all.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.958
Go ahead, call the cops.
Still won't get here in time to save you.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.250
Yeah, well, police are the law.
I want justice.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.375
You? You never lifted
a finger in your life.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.375
You gonna ask Pepper to come and kill me?

14:46.458 --> 14:49.875
Yeah, probably not. But there's no need.
I melted down that ring of yours.

14:54.916 --> 14:56.833
You were right.
Vibranium worked like a charm.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.083
What do you say? To killers?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.708
Whoa, he's got your number, am I right?

15:18.791 --> 15:22.375
You forget you programmed the drone
yourself? Your moves are his moves.

15:22.458 --> 15:24.166
I guess I have to freestyle, then.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.083
Each one is for a kill.
Believe it or not, Tony,

15:59.166 --> 16:01.083
I was really hoping
you wouldn't make the cut.

16:02.833 --> 16:06.166
For a minute, I really thought it was
you and me against the world.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.041
We're not fighting the same battles, Tony.

16:10.375 --> 16:15.000
Two gear-head orphans
trying to do right by our fathers?

16:15.083 --> 16:16.458
We sound the same to me.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.375
The difference between you and me...

16:20.000 --> 16:22.916
...is that you can't see the difference
between you and me.

16:38.833 --> 16:42.458
Vibranium spear. Wakandan issue.
Definite hit job.

16:42.541 --> 16:43.958
The Wakandans sent a message.

16:44.041 --> 16:45.333
Not a very subtle one.

16:45.416 --> 16:47.333
How did none of this
get captured on security?

16:47.416 --> 16:50.000
Jarvis was wiped clean. Conveniently.

16:50.625 --> 16:51.916
What are you implying, Pepper?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.916
I don't know, three murders in two days,
and one man at the center?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.416
You are talking
to a highly decorated Naval officer.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.791
It's cool, General.
Cut the lady some slack.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.375
Her and Tony were tight.

17:02.875 --> 17:03.958
What's the next move?

17:04.041 --> 17:06.083
They want a war,
so that's what we'll give 'em.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.875
Put the Liberator drones into production.

17:07.958 --> 17:11.125
Okay, hold on. That'll require
a multi-billion-dollar allocation.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.791
The board will need to be consulted.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.625
The Patriot Act should cover the red tape.

17:14.708 --> 17:18.166
The U.S. Military is hereby seizing
control of all Stark Industries assets.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.875
You must be joking.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.708
No one has ever accused me
of being funny, Miss Potts.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.208
We're at war. You work for me now.

17:34.375 --> 17:39.000
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
You just invented 21st century warfare.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.291
Oh! That is...

17:59.375 --> 18:03.000
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:03.083 --> 18:06.875
Oh, I'm glad to see my Vibranium's
been put to good use.

18:06.958 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, and I'm just getting started.
How about a road trip?

18:16.333 --> 18:20.708
-You telling me this is it?
-Wakandans are full of surprises.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.083
Wakanda.

18:34.666 --> 18:36.541
I found it, Dad.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.833
Hey! Hey, boy!
Come on. We better get going.

18:39.916 --> 18:41.458
Not looking to meet the business end

18:41.541 --> 18:44.125
of one of their spears,
if you know what I mean.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.250
-Savages.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.125
It's like you said.
Wakandans are full of surprises.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.375
I come with a gift.
An offering of justice.

19:03.666 --> 19:07.458
For I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.666
What is this foolishness?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.583
N'Jobu sired no children!

19:13.666 --> 19:17.208
We were led to believe that.
I let us believe that.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.458
We are at war,

19:20.541 --> 19:23.583
he is still an American soldier.
What does he know of our people?

19:23.666 --> 19:25.458
These are my people too, cousin.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.666
I brought you the man
who stole your Vibranium

19:27.750 --> 19:31.166
and murdered your people
as proof of my loyalty to Wakanda.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.416
You have the eyes of your father.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.333
He used to tell me stories about you.

19:54.416 --> 19:58.416
About watching the sunset from the top
of Mount Bashenga with his brother.

19:58.916 --> 20:03.375
I shared the same story with my own son.

20:03.708 --> 20:06.708
I spent my whole life
searching for my home.

20:06.791 --> 20:10.708
Rest easy, nephew. You are home.

20:11.750 --> 20:15.166
But there's no time to rest, Uncle.
War is here.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.000
The drones are made up of Vibranium alloy.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.291
Just like your weapons.
Almost indestructible.

20:22.375 --> 20:26.625
Oh, please. They're built by Americans.
We'll be home in time for lunch.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.416
It will not be that easy.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.875
The drones operate via a hive matrix,

20:30.958 --> 20:34.750
communicating with each other in real time
to maximize strategic efficiency.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.125
Then how do we cut them off
from their network?

20:37.208 --> 20:38.791
We let them inside our force shields.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.625
The electromagnetic interference
will block their satellite uplink.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.583
You're suggesting we let
the killer robots into the city?

20:44.666 --> 20:47.333
That's the only way to disconnect them
from the Jarvis AI.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.000
After that, we'll destroy 'em.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.458
The Americans won't have
any Vibranium left to rebuild.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.166
Why should we trust you
with our people's lives?

20:54.250 --> 20:56.541
I know what it's like to have
someone taken from me,

20:56.625 --> 21:00.333
and if I had the chance to avenge
my father, I wouldn't hesitate.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.375
These people murdered your son.

21:05.458 --> 21:09.375
Even if there's only a chance I'm legit,
isn't it worth the risk?

21:09.958 --> 21:11.583
What say you, General?

21:17.416 --> 21:18.833
For T'Challa!

21:18.916 --> 21:23.833
<i>Yibambe! Yibambe! Yibambe!</i>

21:56.958 --> 21:58.125
Status, gentlemen.

21:58.208 --> 22:01.125
We have full systems green,
General. Drones moving into position.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.666
This is the Wakandan capital?

22:02.750 --> 22:05.375
-Confirm location.
-Sir, all drones are on target.

22:08.708 --> 22:09.833
It's time.

22:09.916 --> 22:14.166
Are you certain about this, <i>baba?</i>
Entrusting our fate to this outsider.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.708
He is family.

22:15.791 --> 22:17.166
Open the shields.

22:24.166 --> 22:27.375
Wakanda. So the rumors are true.

22:35.291 --> 22:37.500
Show them the true might
of the U.S. Military.

22:37.583 --> 22:38.625
Uncle?

22:38.708 --> 22:40.000
Close the shields.

22:53.625 --> 22:56.333
-What the hell is going on?
-Some kind of interference.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.750
The drones have all gone dark.

22:57.833 --> 23:00.125
Yeah, I see that. Get it back online!

23:09.250 --> 23:12.083
It's working!
You were right.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.541
Thank you, nephew.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.875
You've made your uncle and father proud.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.750
I only wish to serve Wakanda.

23:18.833 --> 23:22.208
I'd much rather
you join me in celebration tonight.

23:22.291 --> 23:24.833
Know that wherever
life's journey takes you,

23:24.916 --> 23:27.416
you'll always have a home in Wakanda.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.000
I want a little bit more than that.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.875
That is impossible.

23:39.958 --> 23:41.625
The drones should be disconnected.

23:41.708 --> 23:44.500
Tony Stark! He must've built
a back-up transmitter.

23:44.583 --> 23:45.791
Why would he do that?

23:45.875 --> 23:47.750
That man was a villain.
Didn't trust anyone.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.708
-Charge!

24:20.666 --> 24:23.250
Wakanda forever!

25:34.375 --> 25:36.416
Wakanda forever!

25:42.500 --> 25:44.041
For T'Challa!

25:46.791 --> 25:52.125
<i>Yibambe! Yibambe! Yibambe!</i>

26:29.125 --> 26:31.291
Does it meet your expectations?

26:31.375 --> 26:32.625
It surpasses them.

26:32.708 --> 26:36.083
I wish we could share it with our brothers
and sisters across the world.

26:36.166 --> 26:38.500
Your father wished the same.

26:38.583 --> 26:42.041
Perhaps that is why Bast
has returned you to us.

26:42.125 --> 26:45.375
I am a loyal servant
of Wakanda, Your Majesty.

26:45.458 --> 26:47.333
Let me be of service.

26:48.666 --> 26:54.708
T'With this herb,
you shall become the next Black Panther.

27:13.791 --> 27:15.583
Was it worth it,

27:17.791 --> 27:18.958
my cousin?

27:19.833 --> 27:22.000
Yeah. I did what I had to do.

27:22.083 --> 27:24.333
T'For what? A throne?

27:24.416 --> 27:26.250
For vengeance. For my father.

27:26.333 --> 27:29.333
And for all my brothers and sisters
who suffered through oppression

27:29.416 --> 27:31.166
while you just sat back and watched.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.791
You believe the cure for human
suffering is more suffering.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.416
The cure is power. And now, I have it.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.458
T'<i>Because you stole it.</i>

27:39.541 --> 27:44.041
<i>Power, unearned, can be</i>
<i>a very volatile force, cousin.</i>

27:44.125 --> 27:46.625
<i>It'll get the best of you, eventually.</i>

27:46.708 --> 27:49.958
On your plane, or on ours.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.708
Destroyers are circling the African coast.

27:57.791 --> 28:00.166
I want all Jericho missiles
locked and loaded by 0600.

28:00.250 --> 28:01.958
-Yes, sir.
-All due respect, sir,

28:02.041 --> 28:03.666
isn't that a lot of firepower to aim

28:03.750 --> 28:06.333
at a country most Americans
can't find on a map?

28:06.416 --> 28:08.416
By tomorrow, they won't need to.

28:20.791 --> 28:22.833
What... How did you get in here?

28:22.916 --> 28:24.416
I'm here to help, Miss Potts.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.416
I knew it. He killed Tony.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.083
And your brother? How did you get this?

28:34.166 --> 28:37.458
Mr. Stark was a genius,
but he's not the only genius.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.125
It appears have a common enemy.

28:39.208 --> 28:43.458
Unfortunately, your side
and mine refuse to see it.

28:43.541 --> 28:46.750
So, let us open their eyes together.

28:47.541 --> 28:50.375
<i>Heroes are never really gone.</i>

28:51.291 --> 28:52.958
<i>They live forever.</i>

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
<i>As do the ones they inspire</i>
<i>to carry on the fight.</i>
