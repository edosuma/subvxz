<i>‐ This is a leap of faith.</i>
‐ Oh, my‐‐

1:22:48.864 --> 1:22:50.499

1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:20.863
What I'm about to say is not
gonna be easy to hear.

1:23:20.929 --> 1:23:23.465
I wanna be fully transparent.

1:23:23.532 --> 1:23:25.300
I am in love with each of you,

1:23:25.367 --> 1:23:28.170
and I also was intimate
with both of you.

‐ How do I get past that?

1:23:40.415 --> 1:23:41.550
‐ I don't wanna be here.

1:23:43.685 --> 1:23:45.921
‐ Please, God, let me go.

1:23:45.988 --> 1:23:47.389
‐ Why would you do that to me?

1:23:47.456 --> 1:23:49.858

‐ So, have you ever
seen the movie "Office Space"?

1:24:29.932 --> 1:24:30.999
‐ [laughs]
I love it.

1:24:31.066 --> 1:24:32.301

it was just kind of a sign
for me to, like,

1:24:44.212 --> 1:24:46.615
put that in the past and,
like, move forward.

1:24:46.682 --> 1:24:48.183
So we can
move forward together.
