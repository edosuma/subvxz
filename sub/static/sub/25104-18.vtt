00:00.184 --> 00:02.719
Narrator:
Tonight, on "MasterChef"...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.155
Four covers, table one.

00:04.188 --> 00:06.290
- Two New York strip, two duck.
- All: Yes, Chef!

00:06.323 --> 00:09.960
...the top six take over
a world-class restaurant.

00:09.993 --> 00:12.062
Can you do these?
I-- I'm shaking too much.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.930
- Oh, dear.
- Samantha: Home cooks...

00:13.964 --> 00:16.099
Touch that scallop.
It's ice cold!

00:16.133 --> 00:18.235
...working a two Michelin Star
restaurant.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.804
The duck is overcooked!
This is a joke!

00:20.837 --> 00:23.140
- What could go wrong?
- I got tables that are
ready to walk out.

00:23.174 --> 00:25.108
- I need plates.
- I need the scallops!

00:25.142 --> 00:26.943
- Gerron: Speed it up, okay?
- I'm speeding it up.

00:26.977 --> 00:28.179
- Come on, season it!
- Come on!

00:28.212 --> 00:31.047
I need the food!
Come on!

00:32.048 --> 00:35.018
( music playing )

00:38.455 --> 00:41.958
- Ashley: Top six right here.
- Gerron: Top six, baby!

00:41.992 --> 00:44.428
Growing up in the hood
in Louisville, Kentucky,

00:44.461 --> 00:48.332
I never thought that
I would be in Hollywood, baby,

00:48.365 --> 00:51.034
but I'm in Hollywood.
I made it to Hollywood finally.

00:51.067 --> 00:53.537
Mama, I know you proud
right now. I did it!

00:53.570 --> 00:56.039
- Providence.
- ( cheering )

00:56.072 --> 00:57.374
- Oh, my gosh.
- Providence, baby.

00:57.408 --> 00:59.343
Oh, it's about to go down.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.645
Ashley:
Oh, wow.

01:03.180 --> 01:05.148
Farhan: Wow.
You walk in the door,

01:05.182 --> 01:07.050
it's a small, cozy,
intimate setting.

01:07.083 --> 01:10.053
It's very welcoming
and homey,

01:10.086 --> 01:12.189
even though it's such
a highly regarded restaurant.

01:12.223 --> 01:15.025
Welcome, everybody,
to Providence.

01:15.058 --> 01:19.062
This is one
of the finest restaurants
in all of Los Angeles.

01:19.095 --> 01:24.535
It has and holds two
coveted Michelin Stars.

01:24.568 --> 01:27.070
Gerron: Wow.

01:27.103 --> 01:30.040
That's right, all of you,
it's a "MasterChef" classic.

01:30.073 --> 01:32.476
It's the restaurant takeover.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.245
For the first time ever,

01:34.278 --> 01:37.581
"MasterChef" is taking over
a Michelin starred restaurant.

01:37.614 --> 01:40.016
Our reputations
are on the line,

01:40.050 --> 01:44.221
so we have to set ourselves up
to pull this off.

01:44.255 --> 01:46.223
So we have come up
with two well-balanced teams

01:46.257 --> 01:48.024
to take on this challenge.

01:48.058 --> 01:49.192
Cesar,

01:49.226 --> 01:50.561
Ashley,

01:50.594 --> 01:51.595
and Bowen,

01:51.628 --> 01:53.196
you'll be on the red team.

01:53.230 --> 01:55.232
That means Farhan,
Samantha, Gerron,

01:55.266 --> 01:56.767
you are the blue team.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.502
We will be watching

01:58.535 --> 02:00.571
everything that goes on
in that kitchen tonight.

02:00.604 --> 02:03.507
I will talk to all
of the diners personally,

02:03.540 --> 02:05.776
and I will find out which dishes
they like the best.

02:05.809 --> 02:10.581
Ultimately, we will decide
which team wins this challenge.

02:10.614 --> 02:12.916
Now, you want to be
on the winning team tonight,

02:12.949 --> 02:16.052
because the losing team
face a pressure test

02:16.086 --> 02:19.256
that you really don't want
to be mixed in with.

02:19.290 --> 02:23.460
I've done horribly on the last
few team challenges,

02:23.494 --> 02:26.297
so being here is really
gonna show to me

02:26.330 --> 02:29.065
whether I'm cut out
for this business.

02:29.099 --> 02:33.069
Sam, you look like you just
walked through Halloween
"Hammer House of Horrors."

02:33.103 --> 02:35.439
- A little bit, yeah.
- Do you want to pass?

02:35.472 --> 02:36.740
No. I'm-- I'm good, Chef.

02:36.773 --> 02:38.809
- Breathe.
- ( inhales, exhales )

02:38.842 --> 02:41.478
Now, our captains.

02:41.512 --> 02:45.649
The captain of
the red team is...

02:45.682 --> 02:47.484
Ashley.

02:47.518 --> 02:49.620
Young lady, find that voice
that we haven't heard yet.

02:49.653 --> 02:52.323
- Okay.
- It's time for you to
step up and hold the reins.

02:52.356 --> 02:53.724
Yes, Chef.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.258
For the blue team,

02:55.292 --> 02:58.295
- Gerron.
- Turned up.

02:58.329 --> 03:00.230
You're giving me
the opportunity

03:00.263 --> 03:02.966
to run a two Michelin Star
restaurant.

03:02.999 --> 03:06.337
This is finally
the chance to prove myself
and my abilities.

03:06.370 --> 03:08.238
- You ready?
- Yes, Chef.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.974
Let's get into the kitchen
and see what's on the menu.

03:11.007 --> 03:13.243
Let's go.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.978
Let me introduce you
to the most amazing chef,

03:15.011 --> 03:16.246
Chef Michael Cimarusti.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.181
- Hi, Chef.
- Hi. Welcome, guys.

03:18.214 --> 03:20.150
So we have
four dishes tonight.

03:20.183 --> 03:21.985
The first one I'm gonna show you
is one of the two appetizers

03:22.018 --> 03:23.954
- you guys are gonna
be responsible to make. Okay?
- Yes, Chef.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.856
We have pan-seared scallops,

03:25.889 --> 03:28.359
carrots and baby shiitakes
cooked in vadouvan.

03:28.392 --> 03:30.327
We have beautiful little
sea scallops from Maine.

03:30.361 --> 03:32.295
They cook super quickly.

03:32.329 --> 03:34.365
Golden brown color like that
is all you need, okay?

03:34.398 --> 03:36.600
- Gerron: Okay.
- But if you don't
cook them quite enough,

03:36.633 --> 03:38.435
they'll still be cold
in the inside

03:38.469 --> 03:39.970
and you don't want
that either, right?

03:40.003 --> 03:41.972
So this is like a--
a little play on harissa

03:42.005 --> 03:43.774
that we make
with carrot tops.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.276
Providence is
two Michelin Star restaurant.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.345
Try to keep the plate clean.
That's the key.

03:48.379 --> 03:51.448
Bowen:
Everything Chef Michael
put on the plate,

03:51.482 --> 03:52.483
it kind of like art.

03:52.516 --> 03:54.317
It's so amazing!

03:54.351 --> 03:56.353
Michael: Next we're gonna do
roasted king salmon

03:56.387 --> 03:58.221
with vegetables cured
in kombu.

03:58.254 --> 04:00.357
Season it liberally, okay?
Super important.

04:00.391 --> 04:02.292
If you forget the seasoning,
the dish is lost.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.994
Gordon:
Guys, understand the timing.

04:04.027 --> 04:05.228
You don't cut the salmon
and then dress the plate.

04:05.261 --> 04:07.364
It's all coordinated.

04:07.398 --> 04:09.332
You absolutely
can't neglect that step.

04:09.366 --> 04:10.867
Gerron:
Timing is key.

04:10.901 --> 04:13.370
There are so many layers
to each dish,

04:13.404 --> 04:16.540
and to do that on the fly
is challenging.

04:16.573 --> 04:18.542
For main courses,
we have two tonight.

04:18.575 --> 04:20.811
Let's start with this,
a Liberty Farms duck breast,

04:20.844 --> 04:23.914
served with a turnip, stuffed
with a truffle duck sausage.

04:23.947 --> 04:26.182
In the middle of service,
when you have ten or twelve
of these going,

04:26.216 --> 04:27.851
and you will, pay attention.

04:27.884 --> 04:29.386
You gotta get the skin
really crispy.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.922
And you know it's crispy
when you can hear it.

04:34.057 --> 04:36.359
You hear it?
Sizzling.

04:36.393 --> 04:38.161
This is a lot to take in
right now.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.596
We're gonna do, like, a--

04:39.630 --> 04:41.998
what's called a dropped
quenelle on the plate.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.401
These garnishes are just
all over the place.

04:44.435 --> 04:46.369
There's so many
different components.

04:46.403 --> 04:48.739
- It's gonna go right there.
- Wow.

04:48.772 --> 04:51.007
I'm still ready to face this
head-on, but this is why

04:51.041 --> 04:53.376
this is a two Michelin Star
restaurant.

04:53.410 --> 04:54.745
So, that's it.

04:54.778 --> 04:56.346
- That's the duck.
- Farhan: Wow.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.281
Okay, and then the beef.

04:58.314 --> 05:01.017
We have New York strip loins
served with asparagus

05:01.051 --> 05:03.253
and a relish that we make
with pickled ramps

05:03.286 --> 05:04.688
and roasted green tomato.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.256
The steak we're gonna grill,
okay?

05:06.289 --> 05:07.891
And every time you flip it,

05:07.924 --> 05:10.226
brush it with a little bit
of Wagyu fat.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.528
It lends a tremendous amount
of flavor.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.597
New York strip basted
in its own fat.

05:13.630 --> 05:15.298
Like, who thinks like this?

05:15.331 --> 05:16.867
Has anybody ever made
a quenelle?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.401
- I've tried.
- Okay.

05:18.435 --> 05:19.870
Well, you're gonna
have to do it today.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.371
Farhan:
We're home cooks.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.873
We're not even
classically trained.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.609
None of us have worked
in a restaurant,

05:25.642 --> 05:27.944
and we're about to take over
one of the best restaurants
in the world.

05:27.978 --> 05:29.713
The stakes could not be
higher right now.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.548
- I think that's it.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.484
Gordon: Beautiful.
Really beautiful.

05:33.517 --> 05:35.452
- Chef, that's stunning.
Thank you.
- Michael: Thank you.

05:35.486 --> 05:37.721
- Gordon: I hope you were
all paying attention.
- Yeah.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.255
Listen, of course,
you're going to have
an expediter tonight as well.

05:39.289 --> 05:41.091
This guy's done this
a few times before,

05:41.124 --> 05:44.461
and he will only
let perfect plates
leave that hot plate.

05:44.495 --> 05:46.429
Guess who's expediting.

05:46.463 --> 05:48.832
- You. Oh, yes.
- That's right. Me.

05:48.865 --> 05:52.402
Are you all ready to put on
your first chef whites?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.471
- Yes, Chef!
- You now have control

05:54.505 --> 05:57.407
of a Michelin starred
restaurant.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.576
- Wow.
- Do not let us down.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.478
- Gordon: Off you go.
- Go.

06:01.512 --> 06:02.513
- Heard, Chef.
- Let's go.

06:14.491 --> 06:16.660
- Good evening. How are you?
- Red team, blue team,

06:16.693 --> 06:18.461
we're literally one minute away
from sitting down.

06:18.495 --> 06:20.664
- Are we ready? Great.
- Yes, Chef.

06:20.697 --> 06:22.799
- Good luck to you both, yes?
- Thank you, Chef.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.435
This is the first time
that "MasterChef"

06:25.468 --> 06:29.472
has ever taken over
a Michelin Star restaurant.

06:29.506 --> 06:34.110
Tonight is really
going to determine
who has the passion,

06:34.144 --> 06:37.681
who has the ability,
who has the skill to survive,

06:37.714 --> 06:39.716
and who's gonna go home crying.

06:44.855 --> 06:47.858
( indistinct chatter )

06:47.891 --> 06:51.628
An appetizer option,
we have scallops and salmon
to start off with.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.364
Okay, I have on order
three tables for the red team,

06:54.397 --> 06:55.999
and three tables
for the blue team.

06:56.032 --> 06:59.002
Blue team on order--
four covers, table nine.

06:59.035 --> 07:01.504
- One scallop, three salmon.
- Yes, Chef.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.807
Red team, listen up. On order--
four covers, table two.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.141
Two scallops, two salmon.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.509
- Heard?
- Heard, Chef.

07:06.543 --> 07:07.978
Thank you.
We're moving, guys.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.379
- Yes, Chef.
- Let's go.

07:14.785 --> 07:17.353
Good evening, folks.
Welcome to the Providence
Restaurant.

07:17.387 --> 07:19.055
- Gerron: All right,
so game time.
- Farhan: Salmon down.

07:19.089 --> 07:20.691
Get that skin nice
and crispy.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.926
Ashley:
These are first plates,
make them perfect.

07:25.562 --> 07:28.164
- Dining room's full.
- Dining room's full.
Can we hurry up, please?

07:28.198 --> 07:29.900
- Ashley: Heard, Chef.
- Yes, Chef, heard.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.401
Cesar: Hurry, Bowen, hurry.
You gotta be faster, Bowen.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.236
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Gordon: Gerron.

07:33.269 --> 07:35.438
- Yes, Chef.
- We're six minutes
to the window.

07:35.471 --> 07:37.774
- Three salmon,
one scallop. Yes?
- Three salmon, one scallop,

07:37.808 --> 07:39.442
- coming up, Chef.
- Service, please.

07:39.475 --> 07:40.877
Pick up three salmon,
thank you.

07:40.911 --> 07:43.179
- Scallops up.
- They're overcooked.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.514
- Are they? Okay.
- They're over-- hey, Gerron.
They're solid.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.382
- Sorry, Chef.
- Start again. Let's go.

07:46.416 --> 07:48.852
- Sam, I need those
scallops cooked, okay?
- I--

07:48.885 --> 07:50.453
- Just stop screaming at me.
- I'm sorry.

07:50.486 --> 07:51.855
- Oh, dear.
- I don't mean to scream,

07:51.888 --> 07:53.456
but I need you
to speed it up, okay?

07:53.489 --> 07:55.425
- I'm-- I'm speeding it up.
- All right.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.027
Samantha:
You know, I'm supposed to be

07:57.060 --> 07:58.862
in classes right now,
doing exams,

07:58.895 --> 08:02.432
but instead I'm working
a two Michelin Star restaurant.

08:02.465 --> 08:04.034
What could go wrong?

08:04.067 --> 08:05.869
- I need the scallops!
- Yes, Chef.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.904
It's the same table
and the food's not ready!

08:07.938 --> 08:09.706
Gerron: Scallops,
scallops, scallops!

08:09.740 --> 08:11.441
Can you go
with the salmon

08:11.474 --> 08:13.409
and come back
for the scallop, please.

08:13.443 --> 08:14.745
I'm just trying to perfect
the cook on these scallops.

08:14.778 --> 08:16.546
My first plate
were overcooked,

08:16.579 --> 08:18.481
and then my second plate...

08:18.514 --> 08:19.883
- It's ice cold!
- Ice cold.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.451
- ...and again.
- Touch that scallop.

08:21.484 --> 08:23.453
Look at it. Tepid.

08:23.486 --> 08:25.656
Hey, I've sent the salmon.

08:25.689 --> 08:27.457
I need a roasted scallop.

08:27.490 --> 08:28.892
This is the third time now.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.594
- Sorry, Chef.
- Samantha's flustered.

08:31.628 --> 08:33.830
She doesn't know
what's going on,
she can't focus.

08:33.864 --> 08:35.498
- Sam.
- Yes?

08:35.531 --> 08:37.500
Are you confident
that you can get scallops done?

08:37.533 --> 08:39.102
I'm-- I'm trying.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.570
You go ahead and plate.
I got this.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.538
I got this. Thank you.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.915
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.483
Cesar: All right, Bowen,
you gotta be quicker, buddy.

08:53.516 --> 08:55.986
Ashley, we're 14 minutes now
at this first table.

08:56.019 --> 08:58.088
What's he doing?
Speed it up, Bowen, please!

08:58.121 --> 08:59.589
- Cesar: Come on, guys,
get it faster.
- Yes, yes, Chef.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.591
Bowen takes a lot of pride
in his plating,

09:01.624 --> 09:05.528
but tonight is not the night
to move slow.

09:05.561 --> 09:07.463
- I need it!
- All right, come on, guys.

09:07.497 --> 09:08.965
- Put it on the plate.
Go put it on the plate.
- Okay.

09:08.999 --> 09:11.034
Chef Ramsay does not
have time for that.

09:11.067 --> 09:13.169
You can't work like you do
in the MasterChef kitchen, guys.

09:13.203 --> 09:15.105
- Bowen: I'm sorry, Chef.
- Aarón?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.606
- Yes, sir?
- Would you mind just
helping, please?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.474
- The red team, please.
- Of course.

09:18.508 --> 09:20.643
Chef, I got tables
that are ready to walk out
on the red team.

09:20.677 --> 09:22.345
I need plates now.
Let's go, red team.

09:22.378 --> 09:23.613
- Yes, Joe.
- Y'all need slicing?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.615
I can slice,
you finish dressing.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.650
I got it. I got it.

09:27.684 --> 09:29.052
- Cesar: Don't try
to be the hero. Come on.
- Yes.

09:29.085 --> 09:31.287
There are no plates
getting out

09:31.321 --> 09:33.623
and these guests
are not happy.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.958
They're gonna leave hungry.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.193
Guys, come on, guys.
Focus.

09:37.227 --> 09:40.196
- Ashley, I'm dying here.
I need the food!
- Ashley: I know. Heard.

09:40.230 --> 09:42.132
- Let's go.
- This is a joke!

09:42.165 --> 09:44.200
This guy is so slow,
it's extraordinary.

09:44.234 --> 09:46.502
Ashley:
My culinary dream
is on the line,

09:46.536 --> 09:48.304
and I'll be damned

09:48.338 --> 09:50.140
if I allow anyone

09:50.173 --> 09:52.075
to take my dream from me.

09:52.108 --> 09:53.710
Let's go, let's go.
Give it to the chef.

09:53.744 --> 09:56.212
Come on!
Wake up a little bit!

09:56.246 --> 09:58.915
Ashley, my ( bleep ) grandma
has got more vigor than him.

09:58.949 --> 10:00.550
- Yes, Chef.
- And she's dead.

10:12.963 --> 10:14.898
Hey, Ashley, I'm dying here.

10:14.931 --> 10:17.233
- I need the food!
- Yes, Chef.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.035
- We're gonna have
to switch you, okay?
- Okay.

10:19.069 --> 10:21.838
New game plan:
Cesar is gonna be
on both proteins.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.007
Bowen is gonna be on veg,

10:24.040 --> 10:26.943
and I will be
plating everything.

10:26.977 --> 10:28.244
Nothing is getting by me.

10:28.278 --> 10:29.846
Right here, Chef.
Four top up.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.581
Table six, please.
Thank you.

10:31.614 --> 10:32.949
( sighs )

10:33.984 --> 10:36.119
Gordon:
Oh, my God.

10:36.152 --> 10:37.854
Hey, young man.

10:37.888 --> 10:41.557
Did you just slice the salmon
without plating first?

10:41.591 --> 10:43.193
- Yes, Chef, I did.
- Come here.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.895
What happens with the salmon
when you slice it now?

10:44.928 --> 10:46.963
The juice is gonna come out.

10:46.997 --> 10:48.398
I don't wanna see you
slice that salmon
till plates are ready.

10:48.431 --> 10:50.466
- Gerron.
- Yes, Chef.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.369
- I need sync--
synchronization.
- Okay.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.905
We have to improve our timing.

10:54.938 --> 10:58.041
The garnishes and plating
has to correlate

10:58.074 --> 10:59.776
with the time of my salmon.

10:59.810 --> 11:01.912
- How long on
my salmon, brother?
- Salmon is up resting,

11:01.945 --> 11:03.914
- waiting on you.
- The salmon's overcooked.

11:03.947 --> 11:05.916
It's overcooked. It's mush.

11:05.949 --> 11:08.084
- Gerron, hey.
- Chef, I'm trying to cook--

11:08.118 --> 11:10.486
I'm trying to ( bleep )
do scallops and every
( bleep ) thing.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.088
Hey, don't start ( bleep )
screaming at me.

11:12.122 --> 11:13.723
- Okay?
- Okay, I apologize.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.092
So the problem is your front
two team are too slow,

11:16.126 --> 11:17.660
'cause when that salmon's
cooked, it's resting,

11:17.693 --> 11:19.462
- but it's resting too long.
- Right, Chef.

11:19.495 --> 11:22.098
We cannot win this challenge
with a one-man show.

11:22.132 --> 11:25.268
We need to speed it up
and get this stuff out

11:25.301 --> 11:27.003
or we are going to lose.

11:27.037 --> 11:28.504
Aarón, could you please

11:28.538 --> 11:29.739
show them how to cook
a scallop, please?

11:29.772 --> 11:31.107
- Yes, absolutely.
- Right now.

11:31.141 --> 11:33.743
All right, guys,
take it easy.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.012
I'm gonna come with you guys
and I'm gonna work with you
on some scallops, okay?

11:36.046 --> 11:38.314
- Where's the salmon?
- It's right here, Chef.

11:38.348 --> 11:41.117
Thank you.
Service, please.

11:42.485 --> 11:44.120
Man: Wow!

11:44.154 --> 11:45.488
Woman:
It looks beautiful.

11:47.657 --> 11:50.994
- Oh, my God.
- That's amazing.

11:51.027 --> 11:53.629
- Come on, guys, keep hustling.
- Gordon: Last ticket, red team.

11:53.663 --> 11:55.531
- That looks really nice, Bowen.
- Bowen: Yes, yes, thank you.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.500
- Ashley: Four top up!
Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.002
Table seven. Go.

11:59.035 --> 12:00.503
Woman: Look at that!
It looks amazing.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.372
Man: Phenomenal.

12:02.405 --> 12:04.507
What do you think about
the red team's appetizer course?

12:04.540 --> 12:07.510
- Actually, I'm a huge fan.
- Come on, please, blue team.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.112
Farhan: We gotta just
get the last plate out, man.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.646
I got salmon up.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.016
- Scallops up.
- Let's go. Service, please.

12:13.049 --> 12:15.986
Now, you happen to be seated
at a blue team table.

12:16.019 --> 12:18.321
- Joe: Are you enjoying
your appetizer?
- Man: I love the scallops.

12:18.354 --> 12:21.391
We travel all around the world,
and it would definitely fit

12:21.424 --> 12:23.393
any Michelin Star-rated
restaurant

12:23.426 --> 12:25.195
that I've ever been at.

12:29.599 --> 12:31.167
- Gordon: So,
red team, blue team.
- Home cooks: Yes, Chef.

12:31.201 --> 12:32.568
Our appetizers were sticky,

12:32.602 --> 12:34.304
but our entrées
need to finish brilliantly.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.206
- Yes, Chef.
- Are we ready?

12:36.239 --> 12:39.175
- Yes, Chef.
- Blue team, away now,
two duck, two strip,

12:39.209 --> 12:41.044
followed by three duck,
one New York strip.

12:41.077 --> 12:43.013
- Heard?
- Heard!

12:43.046 --> 12:46.149
Thank you. Red team, fire now,
two duck, two strip,

12:46.182 --> 12:47.417
followed by three duck,
one New York strip.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.085
- Heard?
- Yes, Chef.

12:49.119 --> 12:51.254
- Let's go.
- All right, my duck is in.

12:51.287 --> 12:53.256
- Excellent. We going?
- Yes, Chef.

12:53.289 --> 12:55.525
- We got a system
going now. Good.
- Yeah, we do, Chef.

12:55.558 --> 12:57.727
- Blue Team, I'm waiting on
three duck, one strip,
- Yes, Chef.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.662
followed by two duck,
two strip.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.365
Samantha:
Gordon yelling out
those table orders,

13:02.398 --> 13:04.034
it's just really confusing.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.036
Followed by two duck,
two strip,

13:06.069 --> 13:07.770
followed by two duck,
two strip, yes?

13:07.803 --> 13:10.073
And it's really hard
to keep 'em all straight.

13:10.106 --> 13:11.774
- Samantha.
- Yes, Chef.

13:11.807 --> 13:13.176
On the first table,
what's going?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.578
- Two duck, two strip.
- Gerron.

13:15.611 --> 13:17.013
- Yes, Chef.
- What's going on
the first table?

13:17.047 --> 13:18.281
Three duck,
one strip coming.

13:18.314 --> 13:20.183
Yeah, but she's
dressing two duck.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.617
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Oh, okay. Sorry, Chef.

13:21.651 --> 13:24.087
After that,
it's two duck, two strip.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.089
- Okay, two duck,
two strip coming after.
- Oh, okay.

13:26.122 --> 13:28.058
It's so hard to focus
because of the pressure.

13:28.091 --> 13:29.759
But we're mixing up
our plates.

13:29.792 --> 13:31.294
Like, we can't be doing this
right now.

13:31.327 --> 13:33.363
Guys, I need three strips.
I need three strip.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.298
Three strip?
Is it three strip
or three duck?

13:35.331 --> 13:37.067
- Samantha: Three strip.
- Farhan: Okay.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.135
Sam! Sam! Three duck!

13:39.169 --> 13:42.205
Three duck. Sorry, Chef.
Won't happen again.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.207
Gerron:
Here's hoping, y'all.
Here's hoping.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.575
Farhan:
Here's hoping, Chef. Heard.

13:45.608 --> 13:47.610
Holy ( bleep ).

13:49.279 --> 13:51.114
These ducks are ready
to go here.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.215
Nice, thank you.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.749
- Gordon: Cesar.
- Chef.

13:53.783 --> 13:55.485
- We're on a roll now. Okay?
- Yes, Chef.

13:55.518 --> 13:57.220
- Keep it going.
- Heard, Chef.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.055
- He's on point.
- Ashley: Three minutes on rest.

13:59.089 --> 14:02.158
- Yeah. Also resting.
- Okay. What about our Wagyu?

14:02.192 --> 14:05.495
Cesar is being
such an all-star

14:05.528 --> 14:07.297
right now
with these proteins.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.665
He's getting steak out,
he's getting duck out.

14:09.699 --> 14:12.802
It's all cooked to perfection.

14:12.835 --> 14:15.105
- Cesar. Great job.
- Chef. Thank you.

14:15.138 --> 14:17.173
Hey, your temperatures
are on point.

14:17.207 --> 14:18.741
- Thank you, Chef.
- Ashley: Thank you, Cesar.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.276
I'm cooking at
a Michelin-rated restaurant,

14:20.310 --> 14:22.678
and Chef Ramsay
is acknowledging

14:22.712 --> 14:24.347
that I'm doing a good job.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.316
I've never seen anybody cook
proteins like this.

14:26.349 --> 14:27.683
Thank you, Chef.

14:27.717 --> 14:29.619
I can die and go to heaven
tomorrow

14:29.652 --> 14:31.187
and my life
would feel complete.

14:31.221 --> 14:32.488
Hey, we're not done yet.

14:32.522 --> 14:34.124
- Yes, Chef.
- Okay? Keep it going.

14:34.157 --> 14:35.325
- Yes, Chef.
- Service, please.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.759
Table four.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.262
Good evening.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.664
Here we have the duck
and the steak of the red team.

14:41.697 --> 14:45.201
- Bon appétit.
- I could not imagine

14:45.235 --> 14:49.305
that duck tastes like this.
It's so good.

14:49.339 --> 14:50.306
That's good.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.774
Aarón:
Great job.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.543
- Aarón.
- Yeah?

14:53.576 --> 14:55.011
- We are backed up
on the blue team.
- Yes, sir.

14:55.045 --> 14:57.380
I'm 25 minutes in,
I've got one table out.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.349
Aarón: Blue team,
that's unacceptable.

14:59.382 --> 15:02.852
Gerron: Come on, y'all.
I got six duck up
ready to go.

15:02.885 --> 15:04.854
- Farhan: All right.
- Gerron: We gotta move.

15:04.887 --> 15:06.822
- They're getting
cold up there.
- Yeah, heard.

15:06.856 --> 15:08.624
Gerron:
I'm putting all
of these proteins up,

15:08.658 --> 15:10.560
but there's no protein
going out.

15:10.593 --> 15:12.062
There's no plates going out.

15:12.095 --> 15:14.164
All the meat
is just sitting there.

15:14.197 --> 15:16.166
That beef is
sitting too long, y'all.
It's sitting too long.

15:16.199 --> 15:17.633
I'm sorry about that.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.502
Farhan, Samantha,
what is going on?

15:19.535 --> 15:21.537
- Duck up.
- Dear, oh, dear.

15:21.571 --> 15:23.173
- Gerron, they're putting
the wrong garnish
- Yes, Chef.

15:23.206 --> 15:25.241
on the wrong ( bleep )
plates now.

15:25.275 --> 15:27.343
- Samantha: Sorry, Chef.
- All right, Sam. Duck.

15:27.377 --> 15:29.345
- Yes. Yeah. Yes.
- Steak. Okay?

15:29.379 --> 15:31.381
Sorry. I'm getting them
confused. Sorry.

15:31.414 --> 15:34.350
Samantha is crumbling
under the pressure.

15:34.384 --> 15:36.986
We are falling
to shambles right now.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.789
Can you do these quenelles?
I'm shaking too much.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.264
- Gerron, I'm getting
complaints now.
- Yes, Chef.

15:48.298 --> 15:50.333
We need entrées
from the blue team.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.767
- Okay, we got--
We're sending them out.
- Heard, Chef.

15:51.801 --> 15:53.436
Heard, heard.

15:53.469 --> 15:55.705
Two duck, two strip, please.
Samantha, how long?

15:55.738 --> 15:58.174
- Samantha: How long, guys?
- The duck is ready.
I just sliced it.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.243
- Hey, I just need a time.
- Gerron: Let's go.

16:00.276 --> 16:02.245
- Farhan: Five minutes, Chef.
- Gordon: Five minutes.

16:02.278 --> 16:03.713
- Oh, my God.
- Aarón: Five minutes? Come on!

16:03.746 --> 16:05.281
Samantha:
We don't have five minutes.

16:05.315 --> 16:08.184
We have got to get
back on track or it is a wrap.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.920
Blue team,
the duck is overcooked.

16:10.953 --> 16:12.355
It's overcooked.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.956
- Samantha: Sorry, Chef.
- Oh, ( bleep ).

16:13.989 --> 16:16.025
Don't fall apart on me now.
Come on!

16:16.058 --> 16:17.293
- Gerron.
- Yes, Chef.

16:17.327 --> 16:19.429
This is dysfunctional!

16:26.001 --> 16:27.603
- Bear with us.
Bear with us.
- Five minutes.

16:27.637 --> 16:29.639
- Joe is waiting.
- Let's go, let's go!

16:29.672 --> 16:31.941
- Hey, I need y'all
to speed it up.
- Thank you, Gerron.

16:31.974 --> 16:34.644
- Gerron: All right, Chef.
- Gordon: Great.
Thank you. Table 14.

16:34.677 --> 16:36.078
Gerron: Let's keep up
the momentum, y'all.

16:36.112 --> 16:37.247
Let's keep it going,
guys, come on.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.581
Samantha:
We got this, guys.

16:38.614 --> 16:40.082
Thank you.
Keep it going, Gerron.

16:40.116 --> 16:42.285
It took a while to get
in the groove

16:42.318 --> 16:43.653
and get into the motions.

16:43.686 --> 16:45.321
Gordon:
And now you're on a roll now.

16:45.355 --> 16:47.390
But I finally feel like
we're starting to get on track.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.392
Gerron: Good job, Sam.
Come on, y'all.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.960
Keep the momentum up, y'all.
Come on, we got this.

16:50.993 --> 16:53.095
That's better.

16:53.129 --> 16:55.097
Gordon: Bowen,
you gotta speed up.

16:55.131 --> 16:56.599
Oh, it's not here.

16:56.632 --> 16:58.000
- What's he doing?
- Duck right there.

16:58.033 --> 16:59.935
- Hey, young man.
- I'm so sorry.

16:59.969 --> 17:01.904
You've got duck drippings
on the beef plates.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.907
He doesn't know
the difference between
( bleep ) beef and duck.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.909
- No--
- Cesar: Bowen,
you know the difference.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.111
- I know the difference.
- I need it!

17:09.145 --> 17:12.482
Cesar:
I've seen Bowen crash-land
in our tag team challenge.

17:12.515 --> 17:14.517
Pressure gets to Bowen.

17:14.550 --> 17:17.119
I'm seeing the same thing
play out again tonight.

17:17.153 --> 17:20.022
- Cesar, we got off to a great
start, but we slowed down.
- Yes, Chef.

17:20.055 --> 17:21.991
Okay, Chef,
we're gonna pick it back up.

17:22.024 --> 17:23.959
Ashley: Come on, guys.
You got to stay in it.
Stay in it.

17:23.993 --> 17:26.962
Ashley:
I need to keep Bowen
literally on my side.

17:26.996 --> 17:29.965
I cannot take
my eyes off of him.

17:29.999 --> 17:32.202
Our guests waiting
is not good.

17:32.235 --> 17:35.538
But there is still hope
that everything
I put up, they like.

17:35.571 --> 17:38.007
- Ashley: Follow me,
right there, boom. Thank you.
- Table one, this is crazy.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.141
Table one.

17:39.175 --> 17:41.177
( indistinct chatter )

17:43.846 --> 17:46.048
I'm eating the red team's
entrée right now.

17:46.081 --> 17:48.117
I've actually got
a little bit of both.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.019
The steak was delicious.
It sort of melts in your mouth.

17:50.052 --> 17:52.021
And the duck is awesome.

17:52.054 --> 17:54.324
Beautiful skin on it.
Kinda crispy and delicious.

17:54.357 --> 17:56.526
- Ashley. Is it coming,
the duck? Is it coming?
- Okay, yes?

17:56.559 --> 17:58.394
- Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef.
- Now, go.

17:58.428 --> 17:59.695
Table six, thank you.

17:59.729 --> 18:02.198
The steak was
absolutely lovely.

18:02.232 --> 18:04.967
For me, cooked to
perfection.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.136
- Cooked to perfection. Wow!
- Perfection, yes.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.738
Come on, guys, you got it.
You got it. Cesar,
you're doing great.

18:08.771 --> 18:10.306
Thank you, Chef.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.008
So I had the blue team
plate duck entrée.

18:13.042 --> 18:16.045
The color was amazing,
the presentation was amazing.

18:16.078 --> 18:17.680
Come on, keep it going.

18:17.713 --> 18:19.515
Farhan, if you see Sam
slowing down, let her know.

18:19.549 --> 18:22.652
The blue team's duck entrée
has great texture,

18:22.685 --> 18:25.421
but I feel that they need
to add more seasoning to it.

18:25.455 --> 18:28.424
- Glaze it with some beef fat.
- Give it to me.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.159
Come on, season it!

18:30.192 --> 18:32.362
- Samantha: Come on, guys.
- Last table, red team.

18:32.395 --> 18:34.764
- Three duck, one strip.
- Three duck, one strip. Got it.

18:34.797 --> 18:36.198
May I join you for a second?

18:36.232 --> 18:37.733
Now, you're enjoying
your entrées?

18:37.767 --> 18:39.535
So you had the red team
cooking for you.

18:39.569 --> 18:41.671
So it's really important
for me to understand,

18:41.704 --> 18:43.205
- was it at the level?
- It's amazing!

18:43.239 --> 18:44.874
- Amazing? Wow!
- It's amazing.

18:44.907 --> 18:46.609
Ashley:
Three duck, one strip.
Last plate!

18:46.642 --> 18:48.210
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

18:48.244 --> 18:50.212
Go, table seven.
Well done, red team.

18:50.246 --> 18:51.614
All right,
let's clear it down, guys.

18:51.647 --> 18:53.616
- Blue team.
- Yes, Chef.

18:53.649 --> 18:54.684
I'm waiting on two duck
and two strip.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.286
Farhan:
Heard, Chef.

18:56.319 --> 18:59.255
I had the, uh, blue team's
steak. It was uh--

18:59.289 --> 19:01.557
I didn't like it.
I loved it.

19:01.591 --> 19:04.226
- Gordon: Last table, blue team.
- Samantha: Two duck, two strip.

19:04.260 --> 19:06.462
Table 14, thank you.
Blue team.

19:06.496 --> 19:08.598
- Yes, Chef.
- Well done.

19:08.631 --> 19:11.567
- Clear down, guys.
- Gerron: Despite the many,

19:11.601 --> 19:13.569
many mistakes
that we had tonight...

19:13.603 --> 19:15.438
Hey, good job, y'all.

19:15.471 --> 19:18.073
...I'm very proud of what
we put on a plate today.

19:18.107 --> 19:20.242
I'm really, really hoping
that we did enough

19:20.276 --> 19:22.111
to win this challenge.

19:27.116 --> 19:29.151
Gordon:
Red team, blue team, line up,
please. Thank you.

19:30.453 --> 19:33.088
What a night!

19:33.122 --> 19:34.790
I wasn't expecting
a perfect service,
let's get that right.

19:34.824 --> 19:37.927
But when you shut down,
the team shuts down.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.296
We depend on each other
to get us through.

19:40.330 --> 19:46.268
What I will say is,
two strong vocal captains
that didn't give up.

19:46.302 --> 19:49.238
It's pretty amazing what
you all just accomplished.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.640
You just ran the kitchen

19:50.673 --> 19:54.310
of a world-class
Michelin Star restaurant.

19:54.344 --> 19:58.247
How many home cooks
do you think could've
accomplished that?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.816
- So, well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

20:00.850 --> 20:05.855
Now, the decision on who won
and who lost this challenge

20:05.888 --> 20:08.491
is completely up to Joe,
Aarón, and myself.

20:08.524 --> 20:10.493
We've spoken
to all the guests

20:10.526 --> 20:14.263
and we saw how you worked
together in the kitchen.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.299
We decided...

20:22.538 --> 20:24.106
...that we need
to sleep on it.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.208
It's that close.

20:26.241 --> 20:29.111
But for now,
pat yourselves on the back,

20:29.144 --> 20:31.146
and remember
what you've just achieved.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.349
- All right, here we go.
- ( cheering )

20:33.383 --> 20:37.152
A little champagne after
a hard shift on the line

20:37.186 --> 20:39.154
of a two-star Michelin
restaurant.

20:39.188 --> 20:41.190
- Santé.
- Yes. Congratulations.

20:41.223 --> 20:42.792
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.160
- Night.
- Good night, Chef.

20:45.194 --> 20:47.863
Restaurant takeover,
it is a beast.

20:47.897 --> 20:49.665
And to have made it through

20:49.699 --> 20:52.868
just solidifies
how much I want this.

20:52.902 --> 20:54.370
Like, this chaos,

20:54.404 --> 20:56.005
this level of adrenaline,

20:56.038 --> 20:59.241
is everything I want

20:59.274 --> 21:01.076
for the rest of my life.

21:01.110 --> 21:02.378
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers red team.

21:02.412 --> 21:04.279
- Cheers, red team!
- ( cheering )

21:18.027 --> 21:20.496
Welcome back, everyone.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.998
To have completed a service

21:23.032 --> 21:25.000
in a two Michelin Star
restaurant,

21:25.034 --> 21:26.869
it has been an honor.

21:26.902 --> 21:28.671
The blue team should win

21:28.704 --> 21:30.706
because the communication
was there.

21:30.740 --> 21:32.041
Even though
Samantha just got flustered

21:32.074 --> 21:34.910
in every situation,
we finished,

21:34.944 --> 21:36.712
we got everything out,
and nothing was sent back.

21:36.746 --> 21:38.414
( sighs )

21:38.448 --> 21:39.415
Red team, blue team,

21:39.449 --> 21:40.683
we have reached our decision

21:40.716 --> 21:43.118
after much,
much deliberation.

21:45.755 --> 21:49.425
Red team,
captained by Ashley,
you started slow.

21:49.459 --> 21:51.627
- Yes, Chef.
- But, Ashley,

21:51.661 --> 21:54.129
great performance
as a captain.

21:54.163 --> 21:55.598
You found your voice,
you looked comfortable.

21:55.631 --> 21:58.734
- Thank you, Chef.
- Blue team, you made mistakes,

21:58.768 --> 22:01.471
- but, Gerron...
- Yes, Chef?

22:01.504 --> 22:05.140
your captaincy
was extraordinary.

22:05.174 --> 22:08.410
You stepped into that
like you were in it to win it.

22:08.444 --> 22:09.745
From last night's challenge,

22:09.779 --> 22:11.747
there can only be one
winning team.

22:11.781 --> 22:14.617
The losing team
are about to face

22:14.650 --> 22:17.553
the dreaded pressure test.

22:17.587 --> 22:18.554
And after that,

22:18.588 --> 22:20.723
at least one of you

22:20.756 --> 22:22.458
will be going home.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.394
The team that will be safe

22:25.427 --> 22:26.829
up on to the balcony

22:26.862 --> 22:30.399
and into the top five...

22:30.432 --> 22:32.134
the red team.

22:32.167 --> 22:34.169
( Ashley sighing )

22:36.271 --> 22:37.840
Ashley, Cesar,

22:37.873 --> 22:39.509
stellar performances,
let me tell you.

22:39.542 --> 22:41.844
Bowen, you found your feet
a little bit late for me.

22:41.877 --> 22:44.346
However, your captain
led your team to victory.

22:44.379 --> 22:47.082
Well done, red team.
Congratulations.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.418
And, please,
head up to the balcony.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.920
- Thank you. Thank you, Joe.
- Thank you.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.955
- Thank you, Chef.
- Gerron: Congratulations.

22:52.988 --> 22:55.357
Blue team,
you'll need one of these.

22:55.390 --> 22:58.027
Please.

22:58.060 --> 23:00.162
Gerron:
I definitely feel like
my team let me down.

23:00.195 --> 23:03.633
You know, I did the best
that I could do as a leader,

23:03.666 --> 23:06.368
and sometimes,
you know, you can't get
everyone on board.

23:06.401 --> 23:09.672
No matter what we have to do
in this pressure test,

23:09.705 --> 23:11.641
I won't let
my mentor Joe down.

23:11.674 --> 23:14.009
I'm gonna kill it,
and I'm not going home.

23:14.043 --> 23:16.879
Tonight, this challenge

23:16.912 --> 23:19.014
is going to be
the toughest pressure test

23:19.048 --> 23:20.950
this kitchen has ever seen.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.786
- Wow.
- Because this test

23:23.819 --> 23:26.121
is not just one dish.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.490
It's not even two dishes.

23:28.524 --> 23:29.892
It's three dishes.

23:29.925 --> 23:34.530
And those three dishes
are all...

23:34.564 --> 23:36.298
Desserts.

23:36.331 --> 23:39.301
And all these
three dishes combine

23:39.334 --> 23:41.136
one of the most
universally loved ingredients

23:41.170 --> 23:43.072
anywhere on the planet.

23:43.105 --> 23:46.041
I'm talking about chocolate.

23:49.545 --> 23:53.849
Under here is one
of my favorite ways
to eat chocolate.

23:57.219 --> 23:59.188
White chocolate panna cotta

23:59.221 --> 24:00.590
with a beautiful
raspberry coulis.

24:00.623 --> 24:02.925
It's a softly set pudding

24:02.958 --> 24:05.227
that originated
in Northern Italy.

24:05.260 --> 24:08.698
The key is to make it creamy

24:08.731 --> 24:12.167
without ever letting it
become gelatinous.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.569
For my dessert,

24:13.603 --> 24:15.705
I've gone
with the most popular

24:15.738 --> 24:18.574
chocolate in America.

24:20.910 --> 24:23.112
Milk chocolate.

24:23.145 --> 24:25.715
Whipped milk chocolate mousse,

24:25.748 --> 24:27.683
a dessert that seems simple,

24:27.717 --> 24:30.686
but it's difficult to pull off
without any errors.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.922
Now, milk chocolate may be

24:32.955 --> 24:35.124
the most popular choice
with Americans,

24:35.157 --> 24:38.794
but there's
a much more decadent...

24:42.965 --> 24:45.100
...dark chocolate.

24:45.134 --> 24:47.136
A delectable, stunning,

24:47.169 --> 24:49.271
dark chocolate
molten lava cake

24:49.304 --> 24:52.474
with a center
of warm dark chocolate

24:52.507 --> 24:55.745
like lava flowing
through the middle.

24:55.778 --> 24:58.714
We want an exact replication

24:58.748 --> 25:01.316
of each of
these chocolate dishes.

25:01.350 --> 25:02.752
To complete
all three desserts,

25:02.785 --> 25:05.655
you only get 60 minutes.

25:05.688 --> 25:07.657
( sighing )

25:07.690 --> 25:09.725
Please, you three,
head to your stations.

25:09.759 --> 25:14.263
Three chocolate desserts
in 60 minutes.

25:14.296 --> 25:15.698
Are they crazy?

25:17.767 --> 25:20.636
You'll find all
the ingredients you need

25:20.670 --> 25:23.072
to make us three incredible,

25:23.105 --> 25:25.074
difficult chocolate desserts.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.976
Farhan:
I love eating chocolate,

25:27.009 --> 25:28.778
but I don't really cook
with chocolate that often,

25:28.811 --> 25:31.180
so I don't know
how I'm gonna do this.

25:31.213 --> 25:34.583
When time is called, all three
of your desserts need to be

25:34.616 --> 25:36.618
on that station
in front of us.

25:36.652 --> 25:39.755
Gerron:
Three desserts?
Are you kidding me?

25:39.789 --> 25:41.857
It's a challenge
for me to do one dessert.

25:41.891 --> 25:44.660
Your time...

25:44.694 --> 25:47.129
starts...

25:47.162 --> 25:49.699
now!

25:49.732 --> 25:52.134
- All right, guys, go! Come on.
- Move fast. Stay focused.

25:54.670 --> 25:56.672
Utilize this
whole station here.

25:56.706 --> 25:59.174
We're here with
the top six best home cooks
in all of America,

25:59.208 --> 26:01.711
and now we're
gonna go down to five.

26:01.744 --> 26:04.379
Joe:
Three very difficult desserts,

26:04.413 --> 26:05.848
varying degrees of complexity
and difficulty,

26:05.881 --> 26:08.718
all to be executed
in one single hour.

26:08.751 --> 26:10.786
This has to be
the toughest one so far.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.688
Ashley:
Oh, my God.

26:12.722 --> 26:14.656
It's hard for me to watch it.
Yeah, it's real hard.

26:14.690 --> 26:17.993
Make sure my panna cotta is
where it needs to be, one cup.

26:18.027 --> 26:20.696
So, we start with panna cotta.

26:20.730 --> 26:23.165
A simple concept,
but it has to set.

26:23.198 --> 26:26.201
It's not really a custard.
It's more of a pudding.

26:26.235 --> 26:28.738
So, you use a bit
of gelatin to bind it.

26:28.771 --> 26:31.073
The real trick is being able
to incorporate

26:31.106 --> 26:33.909
the minimal amount
of gelatin necessary

26:33.943 --> 26:35.978
without making it feel
like Jell-O gelatin.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.747
And you gotta incorporate
that white chocolate as well.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.214
White chocolate's always
a very interesting thing,

26:39.248 --> 26:40.750
very complicated to work with.

26:40.783 --> 26:42.718
Much more difficult
than even milk chocolate,

26:42.752 --> 26:45.721
because the butter fat content
is so high in white chocolate.

26:45.755 --> 26:47.656
From there, panna cotta
gets set into the mold,

26:47.689 --> 26:49.825
into the fridge.
Come on!

26:49.859 --> 26:52.327
Keep it going, guys.
Let's go.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.996
- Gerron.
- What's up, Chef?
How you doing?

26:54.029 --> 26:55.497
I wanna shake your hand.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.099
You're the last hope
I have here tonight.

26:57.132 --> 26:58.934
Now, look, I know you're
not much of a baker.

26:58.968 --> 27:00.770
You're probably
the underdog today.

27:00.803 --> 27:02.738
- You were in the bottom
three with cupcakes.
- Uh-huh.

27:02.772 --> 27:06.341
We know Samantha's
a great baker.
Farhan is a technician.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.210
- But did you learn something
about desserts here?
- Definitely.

27:08.243 --> 27:11.246
I mean, I know that panna cotta
has to have time to set,

27:11.280 --> 27:13.248
and if it doesn't set,
I'm in trouble.

27:13.282 --> 27:15.350
You really got it
in the fridge right away.
Great timing.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.685
- Uh-huh.
- You know the consistency
we're looking for?

27:16.718 --> 27:18.754
- Yes, absolutely.
- All right.

27:18.788 --> 27:20.222
- Good luck, Gerron.
- Thank you.

27:20.255 --> 27:22.257
35 minutes to go.

27:22.291 --> 27:25.627
You should be on to your
milk chocolate mousse by now.

27:25.660 --> 27:28.130
All right, have my cream here.
Butter's good.

27:28.163 --> 27:31.366
With the chocolate mousse,
you melt your chocolate,

27:31.400 --> 27:32.902
- Yup.
- lightly whisk the eggs,

27:32.935 --> 27:35.104
and then you start
incorporating the sugar

27:35.137 --> 27:37.873
- into that milk chocolate.
- A lot of sugar.

27:37.907 --> 27:40.275
For me, the milk chocolate
is all about creaminess.

27:40.309 --> 27:42.744
It has a lower fat content,
so I wanted to reinforce that

27:42.778 --> 27:44.379
with another creamy element

27:44.413 --> 27:45.881
by getting
that whipped cream in there

27:45.915 --> 27:48.117
and make the perfect
silky smooth mousse.

27:48.150 --> 27:50.719
You know a little drop
of water in that chocolate

27:50.752 --> 27:52.754
- can spoil the whole texture.
- Absolutely.

27:52.788 --> 27:54.289
Chocolate too hot
adding to the cream,

27:54.323 --> 27:55.757
it could split it as well.

27:57.827 --> 27:59.728
- All right, Farhan.
- Yes, Chef.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.798
You've got my apron on.
I'm really counting on you.

28:02.832 --> 28:04.399
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling good, Chef.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.401
You know this is really
a test in time management.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.103
I have my panna cotta
cooling down right now.

28:08.137 --> 28:10.272
Looking good on time.
I'm getting my eggs
cooked down.

28:10.305 --> 28:11.740
- This is for the mousse, right?
- Yes, Chef.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.809
Do you consider yourself
an underdog?

28:13.843 --> 28:15.911
A little bit.
Especially, the last
pressure test I was in

28:15.945 --> 28:18.280
was that banana cream pie,
and we both know how that went.

28:18.313 --> 28:21.250
But, you know,
I'm putting that behind me.
I've learned so much since then.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.985
Today is really my chance
to show you guys

28:23.018 --> 28:24.686
that I'm not just a one-trick
pony when it comes to savory.

28:24.719 --> 28:26.455
- I can do desserts as well.
- Best of luck, Farhan.

28:26.488 --> 28:27.857
- Thank you, Chef. I won't.
- Don't let me down.

28:27.890 --> 28:31.593
Gordon:
26 minutes remaining.

28:31.626 --> 28:32.828
Get that chocolate mousse
in the fridge

28:32.862 --> 28:34.463
as quick as you can, guys.

28:34.496 --> 28:37.099
Ashley:
Why does hers look like that?

28:37.132 --> 28:39.168
She folded in the flour
instead of whisking the flour.

28:39.201 --> 28:40.836
- Ashley: 'Cause it was
supposed to be smooth.
- Yeah.

28:40.870 --> 28:43.005
Aarón:
I'm really concerned
for Samantha.

28:43.038 --> 28:45.274
That chocolate mousse
looks incorrect.

28:45.307 --> 28:46.741
It looks like it's flattened.

28:47.910 --> 28:49.711
Excuse me.

28:49.744 --> 28:52.014
All right,
I need to focus on that cake.

28:52.047 --> 28:54.884
And finally, most difficult,
you start your batter

28:54.917 --> 28:56.886
for that molten lava cake.

28:56.919 --> 28:59.121
Aarón:
It's all about that ganache
in the middle, right?

28:59.154 --> 29:00.789
That has to be the one
that's streaming down.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.458
If it comes out too early,
it breaks and collapses.

29:03.492 --> 29:04.960
- Aarón: Mm-hmm.
- If it stays in too long,

29:04.994 --> 29:06.962
it's dry in the middle.
Nothing worse.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.830
Cesar:
All right, guys.

29:08.864 --> 29:10.866
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Come on. Aah!

29:10.900 --> 29:13.502
Gordon:
Guys, we're down
to 18 minutes.

29:13.535 --> 29:15.337
All three of you, start thinking
about your plates.

29:15.370 --> 29:17.306
Looking good.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.875
Gordon:
Don't leave it too late
to start plating.

29:23.946 --> 29:26.748
- I need my plates out.
- ( Samantha groans )

29:26.781 --> 29:28.750
Shoot.
I can't believe this.

29:28.783 --> 29:29.818
My mousse didn't set.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.853
It's basically soup.

29:31.887 --> 29:33.522
( sighs )

29:33.555 --> 29:34.856
How is it, Sam?

29:34.890 --> 29:36.558
It's not set.

29:36.591 --> 29:38.227
- The mousse isn't set.
- Okay.

29:38.260 --> 29:40.662
- How bad is it?
- It's pretty bad.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.064
It's just straight
liquid now.

29:42.097 --> 29:43.933
Oh, my God.

29:43.966 --> 29:45.935
Samantha, calm down.

29:45.968 --> 29:48.337
If you cannot
fix this mousse,

29:48.370 --> 29:49.504
you will be going home.

29:49.538 --> 29:50.940
Damn.

29:50.973 --> 29:52.307
Damn, damn, damn,
damn, damn.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.915
It's not set.
The mousse isn't set.

29:59.949 --> 30:02.284
- How bad is it?
- It's pretty bad.

30:02.317 --> 30:04.286
It's just straight
liquid now.

30:04.319 --> 30:05.854
- Oh, my God.
- Damn.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.357
Damn, damn, damn,
damn, damn.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.392
So your chocolate was too hot
when you added the cream,
so it went to liquid.

30:10.425 --> 30:12.694
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, okay,
we're so one down.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.296
- You still have
two to go. Okay?
- Yes, Chef.

30:14.329 --> 30:16.631
- We are not done.
- No, we're not.

30:16.665 --> 30:18.900
- So we keep this together,
okay? We'll plate that.
- Yes, Chef.

30:18.934 --> 30:20.702
The mousse is soft,
it's fine,

30:20.735 --> 30:23.205
but we're still gonna taste it,
let me tell you that.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.007
Okay? And...

30:26.008 --> 30:27.376
...that mousse is delicious.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.978
- Okay?
- Yes, Chef.

30:29.011 --> 30:31.113
- Y'all can do this.
- Come on, baby, come on.

30:31.146 --> 30:32.948
Gordon:
Come on, speed up, guys!

30:34.616 --> 30:36.551
Guys,
just two minutes left.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.786
Ooh!

30:42.591 --> 30:43.925
60 seconds to go.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.330
Gordon: Focus on
your molten lava cake.

30:48.363 --> 30:49.931
Gerron:
All right.

30:49.965 --> 30:53.168
- ( Gerron groans )
- Ashley: Ooh.

30:53.202 --> 30:55.004
There you go.
There you go.

30:56.505 --> 30:58.573
- Aarón: Come on!
- Come on, Sam.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.976
Come on.
Come down to the front.

31:01.010 --> 31:03.412
- 35 seconds to go.
- Ashley: Come on!

31:03.445 --> 31:04.946
( sighs )

31:04.980 --> 31:06.948
( whispers )
All right.

31:06.982 --> 31:08.583
( sighs )

31:08.617 --> 31:10.819
Oh, Farhan.

31:10.852 --> 31:13.655
Joe:
Gerron is the first to have
all three of his desserts

31:13.688 --> 31:15.357
- up on the tasting table.
- Come on, come on!

31:15.390 --> 31:18.460
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight,

31:18.493 --> 31:21.930
- seven, six, five,
- Ashley: Come on!

31:21.963 --> 31:25.834
four, three, two, one.

31:25.867 --> 31:28.137
- Aarón: And stop.
- Gordon: Wow.

31:28.170 --> 31:30.472
- Joe: Wow.
- All of you, well done.

31:31.706 --> 31:33.275
Gordon:
What a 60 minutes.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.944
Now for the most
important part, the tasting.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.147
I'm gonna begin with Gerron.

31:38.180 --> 31:40.515
Young man,
I'm gonna slice in the middle.

31:40.549 --> 31:42.651
- I wanna see liquid.
- Yes, Chef.

31:49.758 --> 31:51.893
( exhales )

31:51.926 --> 31:54.496
- And that is what
in the center?
- That's liquid.

31:54.529 --> 31:56.498
- Chocolate.
- Congrats.

32:00.702 --> 32:02.037
Did you taste one?

32:02.071 --> 32:03.505
I tasted the batter.

32:13.282 --> 32:14.283
Brilliant.

32:19.088 --> 32:21.256
- Did you taste that?
- No.

32:28.630 --> 32:30.865
- ( Gordon exhales )
- It's definitely liquid, Chef.

32:34.469 --> 32:36.938
( sighs )
I just thought--

32:36.971 --> 32:38.607
I thought
the top looked done.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.543
- It just wasn't done, Chef.
- Ah.

32:43.612 --> 32:44.979
The mix is not even cooked.
It's cold.

32:49.718 --> 32:54.223
So, the molten lava cake,
Gerron absolutely nailed it.

32:54.256 --> 32:55.857
- Joe: Beautiful.
- Right, beautiful.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.292
Joe:
And Samantha?

32:57.326 --> 32:58.760
The plate's naked,
so there's no garnish,

32:58.793 --> 33:01.029
but the actual dessert,
mind-blowing.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.897
- More liquid than Gerron's.
- Great.

33:02.931 --> 33:05.267
Farhan, did he just pour
batter in the plate?

33:05.300 --> 33:07.402
It's not even cooked,
so I couldn't actually taste it.

33:07.436 --> 33:10.572
- Gordon and Joe:
Couldn't taste it.
- That's a shame.

33:10.605 --> 33:12.741
Aarón:
So, I asked all of you

33:12.774 --> 33:15.710
for a beautiful
milk chocolate mousse.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.779
Gerron, let's start with you.

33:18.813 --> 33:20.482
How do you think you did?

33:20.515 --> 33:22.617
I didn't get a chance
to garnish it,

33:22.651 --> 33:24.519
but tasted the batter
and the taste was there.

33:35.029 --> 33:37.566
What happened,
Samantha?

33:37.599 --> 33:39.334
It didn't set.
The chocolate was too warm
when I added it to the--

33:39.368 --> 33:41.803
I'm sorry.
When I added it to the eggs.

33:41.836 --> 33:44.639
Sadly, it does not look
like the one I showed you.

33:44.673 --> 33:48.009
- Not at all.
- But there is something
on the plate,

33:48.042 --> 33:51.646
so I have something
to judge.

34:03.658 --> 34:05.694
- How'd it go, Farhan?
- I think it turned out nice.

34:05.727 --> 34:08.763
I made sure to give
myself enough time

34:08.797 --> 34:10.765
to get the mousse set
in the blast chiller.

34:10.799 --> 34:14.736
In the meantime,
I got the tuile in
and the crumb made.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.776
Well, here's the deal.

34:21.810 --> 34:25.013
Gerron has the most aerated,
most fluffy.

34:25.046 --> 34:27.449
It's a very subtle, smooth,
milk chocolate flavor.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.784
As far as Samantha,

34:29.818 --> 34:32.354
the texture's off
and the visual aesthetic
is skewed.

34:32.387 --> 34:35.089
And then Farhan is spot-on.

34:36.691 --> 34:40.562
And finally,
white chocolate panna cotta.

34:40.595 --> 34:42.764
All right, Gerron.

34:54.743 --> 34:56.511
Thank you, Joe.

35:04.118 --> 35:06.755
- What happened?
- It didn't set in time.

35:06.788 --> 35:07.856
( clicks tongue )

35:13.395 --> 35:16.698
- This is set.
- The panna cotta's set,
but the coulis is not.

35:19.768 --> 35:22.237
I messed it up.

35:22.271 --> 35:24.873
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.518
Think I should be able
to do that?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.520
I think so.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.121
If so, the both
of them are set.

35:43.925 --> 35:46.728
There's set
and then there's concrete.

35:48.997 --> 35:50.532
This could be the difference

35:50.565 --> 35:52.767
between you staying here
in this competition

35:52.801 --> 35:54.936
or leaving here tonight.

36:01.510 --> 36:03.945
There's set
and then there's concrete.

36:06.481 --> 36:07.882
This could be the difference

36:07.916 --> 36:10.485
between you staying here
in this competition

36:10.519 --> 36:13.254
or leaving here tonight.

36:14.623 --> 36:16.491
How much gelatin
did you use?

36:16.525 --> 36:17.626
Three and a half sheets.

36:27.702 --> 36:29.638
One piece.
Sticks together.

36:29.671 --> 36:32.807
- Mm-hmm.
- A coulis in one piece.

36:35.810 --> 36:38.012
You need a jackhammer
to get through that coulis.

36:44.519 --> 36:48.357
All the three panna cottas
themselves were good flavor,

36:48.390 --> 36:50.459
some more gelatinous
than others.

36:50.492 --> 36:51.793
- I don't like them
when they're too gelatinous.
- No.

36:51.826 --> 36:53.995
The real variance was
on the coulis, right?

36:54.028 --> 36:55.864
Gerron's? Perfect.

36:55.897 --> 36:58.500
And I'm surprised
how poorly Samantha did.

36:58.533 --> 36:59.801
Basically raspberry juice.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.803
Farhan's was so gelatin,

37:01.836 --> 37:03.672
so you couldn't even
get through it with a spoon.

37:03.705 --> 37:05.239
Whoa.

37:06.741 --> 37:10.111
Gerron, Samantha, Farhan,

37:10.144 --> 37:13.515
a tough 60 minutes to nail
three very delicate desserts

37:13.548 --> 37:15.817
all using chocolate,

37:15.850 --> 37:19.187
one of the most difficult
ingredients to nail.

37:19.220 --> 37:21.490
Please come around
to the front, thank you.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.163
Tonight we have
three home cooks

37:29.197 --> 37:31.533
fighting for
their very survival,

37:31.566 --> 37:35.236
but one home cook
gave us a master class

37:35.269 --> 37:39.173
with all three
of these desserts.

37:39.207 --> 37:40.241
Gerron!

37:40.274 --> 37:42.577
An incredible performance.

37:42.611 --> 37:44.012
Whoo!

37:44.045 --> 37:45.847
Thank you. Thank you.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.049
Gerron, take yourself,

37:48.082 --> 37:51.753
my apron, and your skill
up to the balcony

37:51.786 --> 37:53.522
where you'll be in safety
from elimination.

37:53.555 --> 37:55.990
- Thank you, Joe. Thank you.
- Good job.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.992
Gerron:
I can't get up there
fast enough.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.428
Let's go.

37:59.461 --> 38:00.929
Top five,
here I come, baby!

38:00.962 --> 38:04.933
Who would've thought
that these big old hands

38:04.966 --> 38:08.503
could produce such delicate,
beautiful desserts?

38:08.537 --> 38:11.506
Now it's just
you two remaining.

38:11.540 --> 38:15.444
Samantha, tonight
you lost a bit of focus,

38:15.477 --> 38:17.512
and you were
somewhat frazzled,

38:17.546 --> 38:20.882
but textbook
chocolate lava cake.

38:20.915 --> 38:22.584
- Thank you, Chef.
- Let's get that right.

38:22.617 --> 38:26.254
Farhan, your precision
in this competition

38:26.287 --> 38:27.556
is wonderful to watch.

38:27.589 --> 38:30.091
However,
you know and I know,

38:30.124 --> 38:34.696
you served me the top of an
undercooked molten lava cake.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.866
Aarón, what'd you think
of the chocolate mousses?

38:37.899 --> 38:40.702
Samantha,
it's a very simple dessert

38:40.735 --> 38:44.573
that sadly gives really
no room to hide behind it.

38:44.606 --> 38:48.376
I think it's obvious that
it was just off structurally.

38:48.409 --> 38:51.513
Farhan, your plate looked
beautiful and it was delicious.

38:52.781 --> 38:55.550
The story of panna cotta.

38:55.584 --> 38:58.286
Technical errors in both.

38:58.319 --> 39:01.322
Samantha, your coulis was
basically raspberry juice.

39:01.355 --> 39:04.559
And Farhan, your panna cotta
was way too gelatinous,

39:04.593 --> 39:06.895
a little bit too firm.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.997
Unfortunately,
the time has come.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.566
- We have to say goodbye
to one of you.
- Yes, Chef.

39:11.600 --> 39:15.504
The person joining
the top five

39:15.537 --> 39:16.805
of the competition...

39:19.040 --> 39:20.642
...Samantha.

39:26.615 --> 39:29.684
- Head up to the balcony.
- Thank you, Chef.

39:29.718 --> 39:32.687
Top five! Top five!

39:33.855 --> 39:36.324
I'm so close to that trophy.

39:36.357 --> 39:37.826
My next goal
is to just fight

39:37.859 --> 39:40.161
all the way
as far as I can go.

39:40.194 --> 39:42.330
I have learned
so many things,

39:42.363 --> 39:43.965
but there's
so much more to learn,

39:43.998 --> 39:48.269
and I wanna learn it all
so I can do Gordon proud.

39:48.302 --> 39:50.772
Farhan, timing got
the better of you,

39:50.805 --> 39:52.607
and unfortunately,

39:52.641 --> 39:55.176
you left us with
a lackluster panna cotta,

39:55.209 --> 39:56.978
and a grainy mousse.

39:57.011 --> 39:58.613
Aarón: Farhan,
when I gave you that apron,

39:58.647 --> 40:00.181
it was for a reason.

40:00.214 --> 40:02.851
You have a very distinct
personality with your food,

40:02.884 --> 40:04.953
and I just think you need
some more mentoring,

40:04.986 --> 40:07.722
so I'm not gonna let
the mentoring stop here.

40:07.756 --> 40:10.659
I'm gonna open my doors
in New Orleans to you
at all of our restaurants.

40:10.692 --> 40:12.293
You can come down
and learn some things

40:12.326 --> 40:13.862
with us down there.
We'd love to have you.

40:13.895 --> 40:14.963
That's amazing.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.497
- Thank you.
- All right.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.868
I'm just thankful
for this opportunity.

40:19.901 --> 40:22.036
You guys believed in me,

40:22.070 --> 40:23.705
gave me the opportunity
to share my story,

40:23.738 --> 40:25.173
my culture with America,

40:25.206 --> 40:29.744
and I'm 100% a better cook
than I came in.

40:29.778 --> 40:31.713
Right, and we've loved
having you.

40:31.746 --> 40:33.514
Young man,
come and say goodbye.

40:34.716 --> 40:36.484
Joe, thank you so much.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.587
Good job, young man.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.488
- Thank you so much.
- Well done. Well done.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.857
- Thank you so much.
- Now, place your apron
on your bench.

40:42.891 --> 40:44.726
- Have a safe journey home.
- Good job, Farhan.

40:44.759 --> 40:46.227
- Thank you so much, Chef.
- Best wishes.

40:46.260 --> 40:47.962
- Gerron: Love you, Farhan.
- Love you guys.

40:50.965 --> 40:52.734
It's really difficult
to walk away,

40:52.767 --> 40:55.770
but I learned so much
along this journey.

40:55.804 --> 40:58.740
Coming into this,
I was a dental student
first and foremost,

40:58.773 --> 41:00.274
and food was something
that I just did on the side.

41:00.308 --> 41:02.777
- Later, Farhan.
- Bye, guys.

41:02.811 --> 41:06.681
Now leaving, I-- I can really
see a career in food.

41:06.715 --> 41:10.018
Cesar:
Bye!

41:10.051 --> 41:12.320
Farhan:
For me, this is just
the beginning.

41:14.322 --> 41:16.725
- Narrator: Next time...
- Lift!

41:16.758 --> 41:19.293
the top five face
a final mystery box...

41:19.327 --> 41:22.030
Tonight,
a little taste of home.

41:22.063 --> 41:25.634
- ...that's full of emotion.
- Oh, Daddy, don't cry.

41:25.667 --> 41:27.936
You all have to make
a delicious dish

41:27.969 --> 41:29.604
inspired by your loved ones.

41:29.638 --> 41:31.740
- I love you, baby!
- Make something good.

41:31.773 --> 41:34.809
- And an elimination
challenge...
- Oh, my--

41:34.843 --> 41:36.878
Oh, this is a big boy
right here.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.147
- may leave one home cook...
- What do I do with that?

41:39.180 --> 41:41.115
...brokenhearted.

41:41.149 --> 41:44.118
Looks like that beef was
( bleep ) all over my plate.

41:44.152 --> 41:45.019
Wow.
