(DOOR SLAMS)              

01:24.052 --> 01:28.557
Good morning, sir. Nice piece     
about the store in the paper.     

01:28.557 --> 01:30.684
Thank you, Fraser.           
Coffee, sir?              

01:30.684 --> 01:32.144
Yes.                  

01:37.316 --> 01:40.861
Looks like               
we finally won the press over.     

01:40.861 --> 01:42.779
That's great, Harry.          

01:42.779 --> 01:45.532
Looks like               
you really do have it all now.     

01:59.838 --> 02:01.256
Good morning!             

02:08.889 --> 02:11.600
Morning.                
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.      

02:13.936 --> 02:16.313
Somebody got              
out of bed on the wrong side!     

02:16.313 --> 02:17.606
Miss Hawkins.             

02:27.616 --> 02:31.453
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.      
Nice headline, Harry. Well done.    

02:31.453 --> 02:33.705
Something's going right.        
You wanted me?             

02:33.705 --> 02:36.166
Erm... Mr...              
Yes, Miss Blenkinsop?         

02:36.166 --> 02:40.754
Lady Loxley's in your office.     
Wouldn't take no for an answer.    
Says it's important.          

02:40.754 --> 02:43.048
Henri...                
Later will do.             

02:48.637 --> 02:49.930
Lady Mae.               

02:52.558 --> 02:56.144
So you can spare me a few       
minutes of your valuable time, then?

02:56.144 --> 02:59.773
You know I have all the time      
in the world for you, Lady Mae.    

02:59.773 --> 03:04.444
Someone rather special wants to    
visit Selfridge's in private,     
after hours.              

03:04.444 --> 03:06.947
And is this someone          
a friend of yours?           

03:06.947 --> 03:08.615
I think you might say that.      

03:08.615 --> 03:11.743
He's a friend of Mrs Keppel      
and she's a dear friend of mine.    

03:11.743 --> 03:15.747
You know I'm not very keen on     
granting special favours, Lady Mae. 

03:15.747 --> 03:18.709
I like to think my customers      
are all free and equal.        

03:18.709 --> 03:22.337
You might change your mind when    
you find out who my friend is.     

03:24.173 --> 03:26.675
(WOMEN SHRIEK WITH LAUGHTER)      

03:28.844 --> 03:32.347
Miss Hawkins! Ladies!         
It is after nine o'clock!       

03:32.347 --> 03:35.225
Customers are in the shop.       
Sorry, Miss Mardle.          

03:35.225 --> 03:38.145
What is the reason           
for this unseemly behaviour?      

03:38.145 --> 03:39.646
Show her, Doris!            

03:39.646 --> 03:43.775
No, I promised to keep it a secret! 
She's engaged, Miss Mardle!      

03:45.319 --> 03:48.864
Well, that might be an occasion    
for merriment.             

03:48.864 --> 03:50.949
Congratulations, Miss Millar.     

03:50.949 --> 03:53.619
And may one ask            
the name of the lucky man?       

03:53.619 --> 03:57.998
No, er, really, I promised       
not to tell anyone, Miss Mardle.    

03:57.998 --> 03:59.958
You'll have to eventually, my dear. 

03:59.958 --> 04:02.169
It's only Mr Grove!          

04:02.169 --> 04:03.837
(GIGGLES)               

04:03.837 --> 04:07.090
Don't be silly, Miss Hawkins.     
This isn't a joking matter.      

04:07.090 --> 04:10.511
That is rather disrespectful      
to Mr Grove. And to your friend.    

04:10.511 --> 04:12.221
I'm not joking. It's true!       

04:27.778 --> 04:29.988
I see. Well, erm...          

04:32.115 --> 04:34.785
We all have work to do.        

04:35.661 --> 04:37.454
We should attend to it.        

04:38.455 --> 04:40.791
Miss Hawkins,             
I'm leaving you in charge.       

04:52.970 --> 04:55.681
Mr Selfridge has come up trumps,    
Mr Grove!               

04:55.681 --> 04:57.724
Excuse me, Mr Crabb,          

04:57.724 --> 05:00.978
might it be possible to have a word 
with Mr Grove in private?       

05:00.978 --> 05:02.646
Of course, Miss Mardle.        

05:04.898 --> 05:08.819
We can talk about capitalising     
on this later, Mr Grove. Yes, yes.  

05:17.995 --> 05:20.956
What's the matter?           
Oh, nothing, really.          

05:22.082 --> 05:26.044
I've just been invited to admire    
Miss Millar's engagement ring.     

05:30.591 --> 05:33.010
I made her               
promise not to say anything      

05:33.010 --> 05:35.345
until I'd had a chance         
to talk to you.            

05:37.806 --> 05:39.183
It's true then.            

05:39.183 --> 05:42.102
Josie, I'm so sorry.          
Nothing else needs to be said.     

05:44.146 --> 05:47.482
I only wish you'd had the courage   
to come to see me first.        

05:48.400 --> 05:50.694
Let me come and see you        
this evening.             

05:50.694 --> 05:54.573
Give me a chance to explain myself. 
Please.                

05:57.784 --> 05:59.328
Come if you wish.           

06:06.668 --> 06:09.505
I still haven't got used to it,    
Kitty.                 

06:10.422 --> 06:13.133
Half the time it's like        
I can't quite believe it.       

06:13.133 --> 06:16.637
Well, you've done it now, Doris,    
you can't go back, can you?      

06:16.637 --> 06:20.891
I don't want to. I've always      
wanted to be someone's wife.      

06:22.726 --> 06:23.769
Roger!                 

06:24.978 --> 06:26.021
What?                 

06:27.022 --> 06:29.691
That's his name. Roger.        

06:29.691 --> 06:32.402
(SNIGGERS)               

06:32.402 --> 06:34.696
He's asked me to call him it      
in private.              

06:34.696 --> 06:39.034
I don't think I shall ever be able  
to think of him as anything      
but Mr Grove.             

06:39.034 --> 06:42.037
My nan had a dog called Roger.     
Pekinese he was.            

06:42.037 --> 06:45.123
Nasty brute. Take a bite out of you 
soon as look at you.          

06:45.123 --> 06:47.376
Don't be mean, Kitty.         
I'm just saying.            

06:49.670 --> 06:51.505
It's going to be so different.     

06:52.714 --> 06:55.217
I don't even know           
what he likes for his tea.       

06:56.802 --> 07:00.305
I'm going to try and be        
the best wife there ever was, Kitty.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.976
Hasn't he got lovely soft hair?    

07:03.976 --> 07:06.270
I think you've got           
a lovely soft head.          

07:06.270 --> 07:09.606
Could we talk about something else, 
please? All right!           

07:12.651 --> 07:14.528
I'm sorry, Doris. It's just...     

07:16.655 --> 07:18.407
I'm really going to miss you.     

07:25.539 --> 07:29.209
Hello! You're looking         
very pleased with yourself today.   

07:29.209 --> 07:32.379
And why not? It's my birthday.     

07:32.379 --> 07:34.798
Really?                
Yes, really.              

07:34.798 --> 07:39.720
If you'd like to pop up to the     
Palm Court with my present       
at any time convenient.        

07:39.720 --> 07:42.598
It's all right, I'm only kidding.   

07:43.557 --> 07:45.309
Maybe I will.             

07:49.354 --> 07:53.567
Richard III, Henry VII.        
Henry VIII had six wives.       

07:53.567 --> 07:55.903
Don't you think            
that was excessive?          

07:55.903 --> 07:59.823
Then there was James I,        
Charles I,               

07:59.823 --> 08:03.785
Charles II, James II...        
How about American presidents?     

08:05.329 --> 08:08.248
We don't need to know about them,   
Grandma. Oh.              

08:08.248 --> 08:13.170
It's an English school. Our      
Island Story. Britannia rules     
the waves and all that.        

08:13.170 --> 08:15.547
Grandma! I'm in the Colts!       
My!                  

08:15.547 --> 08:18.926
I could bowl you out any time.     
You? I'd hit you for six!       

08:18.926 --> 08:21.470
Let's see you try!           
Shush! Children!            

08:21.470 --> 08:23.764
Ma! Watch me              
punish Violette's bowling.       

08:23.764 --> 08:26.391
I'll watch from the window.      
Give me the bat!            

08:26.850 --> 08:28.769
Girls can't play cricket!       

08:28.769 --> 08:30.979
Those kids               
are more English every day.      

08:30.979 --> 08:33.440
I guess it's only to be expected.   

08:35.192 --> 08:38.820
I was thinking they could do with   
some time back in the States.     

08:38.820 --> 08:41.907
It may remind them who they are,    
where they came from.         

08:43.116 --> 08:44.618
Perhaps we could all go.        

08:44.618 --> 08:46.453
No, Rose,               

08:46.453 --> 08:51.416
I can't see Harry dropping       
everything just to take you      
to Chicago.              

08:51.416 --> 08:54.127
Why not? I dropped           
everything to come to London.     

08:56.171 --> 08:58.465
What? I had a whole life        
in Chicago.              

09:01.134 --> 09:06.390
I'm just saying Harry should take   
his responsibilities to this family 
seriously too.             

09:06.390 --> 09:09.893
I know things have been difficult   
for you lately.            

09:11.103 --> 09:12.563
You don't know.            

09:12.563 --> 09:16.233
Believe me, I can guess.        

09:16.233 --> 09:18.277
But you've got to remember       

09:19.570 --> 09:24.533
that deep down Harry knows       
that he'd be lost without you.     

09:27.286 --> 09:29.955
Well, I shall set things in motion. 

09:31.039 --> 09:34.877
And he's invited us to the opening  
night of Tony's new play.       

09:34.877 --> 09:38.088
You'll bring Rose, of course.     
I'd be hugely honoured.        

09:38.088 --> 09:40.632
But I don't know            
if I can get Rose to come.       

09:40.632 --> 09:44.094
She has to come, Harry.        
An offer like this can't be refused.

09:45.012 --> 09:47.306
In any case, it would do you good   

09:47.306 --> 09:50.642
to be seen with your wife       
more often, if you take my meaning. 

09:52.644 --> 09:54.646
Lord Loxley in good health?      

09:54.646 --> 09:58.358
How should I know? I expect so.    
He's in the country, of course.    

09:58.358 --> 10:00.527
And you're in town.          

10:01.528 --> 10:02.821
Well, naturally.            

10:06.450 --> 10:09.953
Miss Blenkinsop,            
get Crabb and Grove into my office. 

10:09.953 --> 10:14.166
We have big things to discuss.     
The King is coming to Selfridge's!  

10:14.112 --> 10:16.114
Miss Blenkinsop.            

10:17.199 --> 10:21.620
Miss Blenkinsop, I am still waiting 
for my chance to speak         
with Mr Selfridge.           

10:21.620 --> 10:25.123
I am doing my very best.        
He is very busy today.         

10:35.675 --> 10:39.763
Hello, George!             
Oh, very smart! Inside man now.    

10:39.763 --> 10:43.266
Be running the place next.       
Those new serviettes?         

10:43.266 --> 10:44.643
Yeah, just come in.          

10:44.643 --> 10:47.896
Excellent! Give me           
a hand laying them out if you like. 

10:47.896 --> 10:49.689
Mr Perez won't be in till ten.     

10:51.858 --> 10:55.195
How's Agnes, she all right?      
Yeah, she's fine, Victor.       

10:55.195 --> 10:58.824
Has she mentioned me at all?      
No, she hasn't, not lately.      

10:58.824 --> 11:00.450
Oh.                  

11:00.450 --> 11:02.744
I've been wanting to ask you...    
Yeah.                 

11:03.954 --> 11:06.581
You know Kitty Hawkins         
on accessories?            

11:06.581 --> 11:08.250
What about her?            

11:08.250 --> 11:11.503
Do you think              
I might have a chance with her?    

11:11.503 --> 11:14.464
See, she's a bit high class.      

11:14.464 --> 11:16.842
She might think            
I was beneath her.           

11:16.842 --> 11:18.719
I don't think Kitty's high class.   

11:20.971 --> 11:23.724
Have a go.               
If you don't ask, you'll never know.

11:23.724 --> 11:28.061
It's all right for you, Victor,    
you know how to talk to girls.     

11:28.979 --> 11:33.108
I haven't had that much luck lately.
How do I go about it?         

11:33.108 --> 11:35.527
Take her some violets or something. 

11:36.653 --> 11:40.824
Ask her if she wants to go for     
a walk with you, or to the pictures.
Simple.                

11:40.824 --> 11:45.203
No good mooning around, being     
a secret admirer. She might never   
notice you.              

11:45.203 --> 11:46.329
Right.                 

11:47.164 --> 11:48.540
Right.                 

11:50.500 --> 11:51.710
Right!                 

11:51.710 --> 11:55.213
So that's how you have to be      
if you like a girl.          

11:55.839 --> 11:57.299
Really determined.           

12:05.390 --> 12:06.767
You think?               

12:06.767 --> 12:09.144
It's a little radical,         
even for my taste.           

12:09.144 --> 12:12.689
Would His Majesty approve?       
What do you think, Mr Leclair?     

12:12.689 --> 12:15.108
Outrageous!              
I am shocked to the core.       

12:15.108 --> 12:16.318
Excellent!               

12:17.360 --> 12:19.029
Please.                

12:19.029 --> 12:22.407
I was wondering if I could borrow   
Miss Towler for a few minutes.     

12:22.407 --> 12:24.826
Mr Leclair,              
I am not a lending library.      

12:24.826 --> 12:26.995
You borrow Miss Towler so often    

12:26.995 --> 12:29.831
I'm afraid you think          
she's your personal property.     

12:29.831 --> 12:32.876
Oh, no. She's her own woman.      
Very much so.             

12:32.876 --> 12:35.462
I understand that. A few minutes?   

12:37.214 --> 12:40.384
Go on then.              
Bring her back to me as good as new.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.553
Follow me, Miss Towler.        

12:51.436 --> 12:53.438
So what do you want me for then?    

12:55.607 --> 12:57.359
I wanted you to know.         

13:00.737 --> 13:03.240
I've been offered           
a position in New York         

13:05.117 --> 13:07.411
and I've decided to take it.      

13:10.539 --> 13:12.416
With Miss Maurel's company?      

13:13.959 --> 13:15.085
Yes.                  

13:16.044 --> 13:20.674
J. Walter Thompson.          
I am to be the artistic director.   

13:25.595 --> 13:27.723
You have to follow your heart,     
Henri.                 

13:29.349 --> 13:31.685
You never lied to me about Valerie. 

13:33.437 --> 13:35.689
So I wish you             
all the luck in the world.       

13:38.442 --> 13:40.152
Have you told Mr Selfridge?      

13:40.152 --> 13:41.945
No. Not yet.              

13:42.863 --> 13:45.824
He might not be as sanguine as you. 

13:49.703 --> 13:51.121
Thank you, Agnes.           

13:53.123 --> 13:55.292
It's been an honour          
to get to know you.          

14:01.381 --> 14:02.466
Goodbye, Henri.            

14:12.100 --> 14:14.519
Checking as you go. Excuse me.     

14:26.406 --> 14:30.452
George Towler, don't you look     
smart in your new uniform!       

14:30.452 --> 14:32.245
Got anything nice for us today?    

14:34.039 --> 14:36.416
Oh, I say!               

14:37.167 --> 14:39.836
For me? From you?           

14:41.505 --> 14:44.007
And what have I done          
to deserve these?           

14:45.133 --> 14:47.052
It's cos I'm sweet on you,       
Kitty,                 

14:47.052 --> 14:50.722
and I was wondering if you're not   
doing nothing Saturday night,     

14:50.722 --> 14:52.724
maybe we could go to the pictures.  

14:52.724 --> 14:56.061
Who's paying?             
Oh, I am Kitty.            

14:58.271 --> 15:00.023
Well, I don't mind if I do.      

15:00.774 --> 15:04.069
In the thrupennies, mind,       
I'm not sitting down the front.    

15:04.069 --> 15:06.279
Miss Hawkins!             
Coming.                

15:11.618 --> 15:14.037
HARRY: Rose! Rose!           

15:15.372 --> 15:18.417
There you are.             
I've got some great news.       

15:18.417 --> 15:19.668
Oh?                  

15:19.668 --> 15:23.380
The King is coming           
to our store tomorrow evening.     

15:23.380 --> 15:25.632
Strictly confidential, of course.   

15:27.175 --> 15:28.927
You must feel very honoured.      

15:28.927 --> 15:32.139
Well, I'm just not honoured,      
we're all honoured.          

15:32.139 --> 15:33.807
It's an honour for all of us.     

15:33.807 --> 15:36.268
If the King gives us his blessing,  

15:36.268 --> 15:39.896
it opens up              
a whole new chapter for us.      

15:39.896 --> 15:41.732
I really need you there, honey.    

15:42.816 --> 15:45.444
I guess                
it really is my duty to be there.   

15:47.487 --> 15:49.990
I was hoping              
you'd want to be there as well.    

15:49.990 --> 15:52.159
That's a little too much to ask.    

15:56.037 --> 15:58.874
He's also asked us           
as his guests to a first night.    

16:02.335 --> 16:04.546
You don't seem very happy about it. 

16:06.131 --> 16:07.883
Ellen Love is in it.          

16:07.883 --> 16:12.929
I would never ask you except Lady   
Mae said you can't refuse       
a royal's invitation.         

16:12.929 --> 16:16.266
You're asking me to go         
and see your mistress in a play?    

16:16.266 --> 16:18.977
I don't see much of a choice,     
Rose.                 

16:20.228 --> 16:23.523
This would mean everything to us.   
To our family.             

16:28.070 --> 16:29.738
All right.               

16:29.738 --> 16:31.114
I'll go.                

16:48.590 --> 16:52.886
Hello there.              
I haven't seen you all day.      

16:53.970 --> 16:55.347
Doris.                 

16:56.598 --> 16:59.684
You really shouldn't          
have shown this off to everyone.    

16:59.684 --> 17:01.853
We had agreed to keep it secret.    

17:01.853 --> 17:06.316
It was Kitty who let it slip.     
What does it matter?          

17:06.316 --> 17:10.945
I'll be giving my notice        
in soon anyway, aren't I?       

17:10.945 --> 17:13.281
I'm going to be a kept woman.     

17:14.950 --> 17:16.867
Darling girl, you are so sweet.    

17:18.994 --> 17:22.082
But we can't talk like this      
on the floor, you know that.      

17:25.335 --> 17:27.045
I must be off.             

17:28.213 --> 17:29.923
I shall see you tomorrow.       

17:47.399 --> 17:49.901
I don't know how to explain it,    
Josie.                 

17:51.570 --> 17:53.947
Hetty's death affected me       

17:53.947 --> 17:57.242
far more than I thought        
it ever could.             

17:57.242 --> 17:59.411
That's only to be expected       
at first.               

17:59.411 --> 18:01.037
Please, let me go on.         

18:03.457 --> 18:07.836
I was struck by this terrible     
sense of my own mortality,       

18:07.836 --> 18:12.382
of dying without leaving        
something of myself behind.      

18:13.925 --> 18:16.803
I would gladly             
have borne you a child.        

18:17.971 --> 18:20.599
I always thought            
you were wedded to your work.     

18:22.809 --> 18:25.979
How little you men           
know what we women really long for. 

18:28.774 --> 18:31.151
But now, of course,          
it's too late for me.         

18:34.279 --> 18:36.239
Miss Millar, on the other hand...   

18:36.239 --> 18:38.742
She has a true kind heart.       

18:38.742 --> 18:43.163
And she wants nothing more in life  
than to be someone's wife       
and mother.              

18:43.163 --> 18:48.001
And Doris can save me         
from the terror of dying        

18:48.001 --> 18:50.337
without leaving            
any trace of me behind.        

18:56.718 --> 18:59.388
I hope you will be           
a good husband to her, Roger.     

19:01.098 --> 19:06.269
She will never know          
I loved another far, far more.     

19:07.646 --> 19:09.481
And did you, truly?          

19:10.774 --> 19:12.109
I did.                 

19:13.568 --> 19:15.112
I do.                 

19:16.738 --> 19:18.698
You are the love of my life.      

19:22.285 --> 19:24.371
Thank you for saying that.       

19:25.747 --> 19:28.834
Whether it's true or not,       
I shall always remember it.      

19:34.840 --> 19:35.924
Oh, Josie.               

19:39.177 --> 19:41.388
It needn't end like this, need it?  

19:42.514 --> 19:44.349
I don't understand.          

19:44.349 --> 19:48.937
We could still have our        
precious Tuesday evenings together. 

19:48.937 --> 19:52.357
Doris wouldn't know. I would never  
hurt her unnecessarily.        

19:52.357 --> 19:57.320
I could tell her I spend one night  
a week at my club as I always have  
done.                 

19:57.320 --> 20:00.115
We needn't               
lose each other after all.       

20:01.575 --> 20:03.410
But it seems so wrong.         

20:03.410 --> 20:07.581
But we know it is not wrong      
in our hearts.             

20:07.581 --> 20:09.124
To me, it is.             

20:11.042 --> 20:14.129
And I could never do that to Doris. 
She'd never know.           

20:14.129 --> 20:15.380
Yes but I will.            

20:17.924 --> 20:21.553
I'd like you to leave now,       
please, Roger.             

20:22.387 --> 20:24.556
If that's how you feel.        

20:32.731 --> 20:34.066
Good night, Josie.           

20:54.909 --> 20:57.870
All right, ladies.           
Let me see your curtseys.       

20:57.870 --> 21:01.707
After a count of three.        
One, two, three!            

21:04.460 --> 21:07.254
No, no, no, no.            

21:07.254 --> 21:09.090
It's more a sort of a...        

21:16.472 --> 21:20.393
Well, keep practising.         
Practice makes perfect.        

21:20.393 --> 21:24.146
What about them, Mr Crabb?       
Oh, yes, I see.            

21:24.146 --> 21:27.316
Curtsey doesn't look          
right in knickerbockers, does it?   

21:27.316 --> 21:30.444
You can do a boy's bow. Like this.  

21:32.571 --> 21:34.824
(ALL GIGGLE)              
Yes. All right.            

21:36.867 --> 21:39.578
Carry on. I'm sure           
you'll be fine on the night.      

21:50.840 --> 21:52.967
How are the windows coming along?   

21:52.967 --> 21:55.428
They're coming along very well.    
Harry...                

21:55.428 --> 21:57.513
Regal but not too ostentatious.    

21:57.513 --> 21:59.557
We want them to look splendid     

21:59.557 --> 22:02.101
but not like we made          
a special effort.           

22:02.101 --> 22:04.937
I've got it.              
Harry, I need to tell you something.

22:06.522 --> 22:08.107
What is it?              

22:10.192 --> 22:13.988
I truly regret that          
I must tender my resignation.     

22:13.988 --> 22:16.115
(LAUGHS)                

22:16.115 --> 22:17.616
I don't believe it.          

22:17.616 --> 22:22.496
I've been offered a job in New York.
I've decided to take it.        

22:24.790 --> 22:27.585
I'm sorry.               

22:27.585 --> 22:30.129
Henri, this is our finest moment.   

22:30.129 --> 22:33.841
The King himself is visiting      
our store this very day.        

22:33.841 --> 22:36.677
You think that now           
is a good time to do this?       

22:36.677 --> 22:39.680
With something like this,       
no time is a good time, Harry.     

22:39.680 --> 22:43.017
New York. J. Walter Thompson.     
I can spread my wings there.      

22:43.017 --> 22:46.145
I'll double your salary.        
It's not about the money.       

22:46.145 --> 22:49.565
What the hell is it about?       
Some woman?              

22:49.565 --> 22:51.692
One particular woman.         
And you know her.           

22:51.692 --> 22:55.821
And also my need to prove that I can
be the best without you, Harry.    

22:55.821 --> 22:57.657
You do this to me now!         

22:57.657 --> 23:00.826
I'll stay till my replacement     
arrives. Don't bother.         

23:00.826 --> 23:03.245
Just finish the window and go.     

23:04.330 --> 23:05.706
What? That's it?            

23:08.876 --> 23:12.630
Well, goodbye then.          

23:15.383 --> 23:18.969
I wish you               
all you wish yourself, my friend.   

23:51.335 --> 23:53.838
Well, Mr Selfridge,          

23:53.838 --> 23:56.257
you have built a palace here.     

23:56.257 --> 23:59.301
And one far better           
furnished than any of mine!      

23:59.301 --> 24:01.929
I wouldn't go quite that far,     
Your Majesty.             

24:01.929 --> 24:05.307
Tell me,                
what was it like for you,       

24:05.307 --> 24:08.769
setting out anew,           
an American in London?         

24:08.769 --> 24:11.022
Did you encounter much opposition?  

24:11.022 --> 24:13.941
I had some troubles          
winning round the press at first    

24:13.941 --> 24:16.819
but as far as the British public,   
sir,                  

24:16.819 --> 24:20.906
they'll always give a man       
a fair chance to prove himself.    

24:20.906 --> 24:23.743
Well,                 
I am glad you share my opinions.    

24:23.743 --> 24:27.997
And of course I took my tips      
from Lady Loxley here.         

24:29.915 --> 24:31.667
And tell me, Mrs Selfridge,      

24:31.667 --> 24:33.878
are you settling in quite well?    

24:37.340 --> 24:40.593
I am. Quite well, Your Majesty.    

24:41.510 --> 24:43.888
Well, London has a lot to offer.    

24:43.888 --> 24:48.100
As we shall no doubt see later     
this evening at the theatre.      

24:51.312 --> 24:54.440
That's a wonderful wife        
you have, Mr Selfridge.        

24:54.440 --> 24:57.026
Now, speaking of the ladies...     

24:57.026 --> 25:00.363
Where might I buy a present      
for a rather special one?       

25:00.363 --> 25:04.408
Buy? Sir, no, we would never...    
No, no, no, I have brought money!   

25:05.660 --> 25:09.538
All part of the experience. I have  
never been shopping in my life.    

25:09.538 --> 25:13.125
(LAUGHTER)               
This is the way the world is going. 

25:13.125 --> 25:16.671
And you have brought that world    
to London, Mr Selfridge.        

25:16.671 --> 25:18.714
We're all on your coat tails.     

25:18.714 --> 25:22.760
Oh, what charming assistants!     
What do you suggest I buy?       

25:22.760 --> 25:25.304
Something frothy and delicious.    

25:25.304 --> 25:26.764
(HARRY LAUGHS)             

25:34.814 --> 25:38.067
What about this brooch         
shaped like a dog, Your Majesty?    

25:38.067 --> 25:41.904
That's excellent!           
She loves her dogs.          

25:43.698 --> 25:45.741
Erm... Will this be enough?      

25:45.741 --> 25:49.787
Oh, quite enough, sir. We'll sort   
things out later with your equerry. 

25:49.787 --> 25:53.124
Have you ever seen           
such a big tummy?           

25:53.124 --> 25:57.003
I haven't had this much fun      
in a long time.            

25:57.837 --> 25:59.547
You may now tell your friends     

25:59.547 --> 26:02.675
that your king             
is a man of the people.        

26:02.675 --> 26:05.511
I'll have plenty to tell them,     
Your Majesty.             

26:07.513 --> 26:10.725
Why don't you come           
down to Sandringham this Saturday?  

26:12.268 --> 26:15.396
Thank you, Your Majesty.        
Very kind of you.           

26:19.150 --> 26:22.737
I have to congratulate you again,   
Mr Selfridge,             

26:22.737 --> 26:25.531
on your enchanting store.       

26:25.531 --> 26:28.117
An impressive achievement.       

26:28.117 --> 26:31.037
That's very generous of you,      
Your Majesty.             

26:38.544 --> 26:41.422
Thought you were coming up       
for a bit of birthday cake.      

26:41.422 --> 26:45.801
Am I too late?             
Palm Court, half an hour.       

26:46.761 --> 26:48.596
All right?               
All right.               

26:57.146 --> 27:00.066
Oh, Victor. It's lovely.        

27:03.110 --> 27:04.403
Table for one, miss?          

27:06.405 --> 27:07.740
Yes, please.              

27:19.293 --> 27:22.630
Happy birthday.            
Better late than never, eh?      

27:22.630 --> 27:23.714
Much better.              

27:25.883 --> 27:28.177
So, here we are again then.      

27:29.929 --> 27:31.013
Yes.                  

27:31.639 --> 27:33.391
Could I get you a drink, Miss?     

27:33.391 --> 27:35.601
Now if I recall,            

27:36.936 --> 27:39.772
Miss is partial            
to a small sherry of an evening?    

27:41.023 --> 27:43.359
Thank you. I don't mind if I do.    

27:55.788 --> 27:57.581
Delicioso!               

27:57.581 --> 27:59.083
Very good!               

28:02.044 --> 28:04.338
Remember what we talked about     
last time?               

28:04.338 --> 28:07.883
You told me you were going to get   
your own restaurant.          

28:07.883 --> 28:09.885
Still haven't got it.         

28:09.885 --> 28:14.056
And do you know what?         
I don't mind.             

28:14.056 --> 28:16.726
There's more important things     
than that.               

28:16.726 --> 28:19.895
And you said erm...          

28:19.895 --> 28:22.064
I was a bit special.          

28:23.566 --> 28:26.360
And I still think that.        

28:26.360 --> 28:27.528
You are.                

28:29.655 --> 28:33.576
And you asked me to dance,       
and I wouldn't. Too shy.        

28:34.702 --> 28:36.996
What would you say           
if I was to ask you now?        

28:37.913 --> 28:40.416
Why don't you find out?        

28:55.514 --> 28:57.683
May I have this dance,         
Miss Towler?              

28:58.934 --> 29:01.729
Delighted, Mr Colleano.        

30:13.227 --> 30:16.146
Who is it?               
HARRY: An old friend.         

30:19.107 --> 30:20.609
Evening, Selfridge.          

30:20.609 --> 30:24.863
Travers! Good luck for tonight.    

30:25.948 --> 30:28.659
Frank! Good to see you!        

30:28.659 --> 30:30.953
Why don't you join our box       
to see the show?            

30:30.953 --> 30:34.623
Seen it already. Been helping Tony  
out with a spot of dialogue.      

30:34.623 --> 30:39.253
Maybe we can grab a drink soon?    
Wasn't there something you wanted   
to discuss?              

30:39.253 --> 30:42.965
No. I'm off to Paris in the morning.
Won't be back in London for a while.

30:42.965 --> 30:44.091
Oh.                  

30:44.091 --> 30:46.051
Enjoy the show.            

30:46.051 --> 30:50.055
And just bear in mind, Harry,     
you reap what you sow.         

30:52.307 --> 30:54.226
Come on, there's a good chap.     

30:56.103 --> 30:57.563
Five minutes, Ellen.          

31:04.486 --> 31:07.030
I just wanted to wish you good luck 
for tonight.              

31:08.532 --> 31:11.034
Thank you, Harry.           

31:11.034 --> 31:14.246
I would hate it if there was      
any hard feelings between us.     

31:16.915 --> 31:18.125
None on my part.            

31:19.877 --> 31:21.336
Harry...                

31:22.629 --> 31:25.549
You're not going to like the play,  
not one bit.              

31:25.549 --> 31:28.177
Oh, come on, of course I will!     
You're in it.             

31:29.887 --> 31:31.763
Well, just remember...         

31:32.848 --> 31:34.516
It is only a play.           

31:34.516 --> 31:37.394
(KNOCK)                
MAN: Three minutes, Miss Love!     

31:37.394 --> 31:38.812
Good luck.               

32:08.550 --> 32:12.012
Do you know what it's about, Pa?    
I can't say that I do.         

32:12.012 --> 32:15.390
But I understand            
it's very modern and updated.     

32:17.184 --> 32:20.395
Let's hope Travers writes       
better than he plays poker.      

32:20.395 --> 32:23.440
Are you sure it's suitable       
for young people, son?         

32:23.440 --> 32:26.777
It'll probably go over our heads,   
let alone Rosalie's.          

32:26.777 --> 32:30.614
What does "satirical" mean?      
It's kind of sarcastic.        

32:30.614 --> 32:32.741
Like Violette             
when she's talking to us.       

32:37.246 --> 32:39.289
(BUGLE)                

33:03.063 --> 33:05.941
That's the royal            
seal of approval, Harry.        

33:05.941 --> 33:09.528
The entire audience          
will have caught that nod.       

33:13.448 --> 33:15.117
(MUSIC STARTS)             

33:28.630 --> 33:30.841
Oh, hello.               
Hello.                 

33:30.841 --> 33:34.511
Are you waiting            
to see Lady Lushington?        

33:34.511 --> 33:36.305
Yes, I am.               

33:36.305 --> 33:40.017
Sometimes it seems I spend my whole 
life waiting for Lady Lushington.   

33:40.017 --> 33:41.185
(LAUGHTER)               

33:42.477 --> 33:47.232
She's my patron, you know.       
Oh! And what does that entail?     

33:47.232 --> 33:49.818
A great deal more           
than I bargained for!         

33:49.818 --> 33:51.403
(LAUGHTER)               

33:52.446 --> 33:54.698
Look out, here she comes!       

33:54.698 --> 33:56.992
(LAUGHTER)               

33:58.285 --> 34:00.996
Ah! Maurice!              

34:01.914 --> 34:04.791
A little early             
to be on the scrounge, isn't it?    

34:06.710 --> 34:09.213
And you must be            
little Jilly Pomfret.         

34:09.213 --> 34:11.172
Yes. Hello.              

34:11.172 --> 34:12.466
Hmm.                  

34:12.466 --> 34:15.552
Is Lord Lushington in town?      

34:15.552 --> 34:18.554
Lord Lushington is in the country.  

34:18.554 --> 34:20.474
He generally is when I'm in town.   

34:20.474 --> 34:25.771
And when he's in town,         
I'm generally in the country.     

34:25.771 --> 34:28.440
Secret of a happy marriage.      

34:28.440 --> 34:31.318
I recommend it.            
(LAUGHTER)               

34:51.338 --> 34:55.551
How did we get mixed up        
with these awful people, Maurice?   

34:55.551 --> 34:58.804
Oh no,                 
here comes old Horace Spendrich!    

34:58.804 --> 35:01.306
Look at me! Used to be dirt poor!   

35:01.306 --> 35:05.853
We had nothing,            
me and my poor old ma!         

35:05.853 --> 35:08.647
Pa never came home from the war    

35:08.647 --> 35:11.775
but we got by and look at me now.   

35:12.943 --> 35:16.446
Richest man in town          
and they can't get enough of me!    

35:17.739 --> 35:19.533
Hello, honey!             
(SCREAMS)               

35:19.533 --> 35:21.076
(LAUGHTER)               

35:26.206 --> 35:28.333
He spends his life           
chasing chorus girls          

35:28.333 --> 35:32.379
when all the time his wife is     
going about with a young painter.   

35:32.379 --> 35:34.006
(AUDIENCE GASPS)            

35:34.006 --> 35:37.509
Hello, sweetheart!           
I'm coming after you!         

35:37.509 --> 35:41.555
Aw, come on! Who the heck loves me? 

35:41.555 --> 35:44.892
(LAUGHTER)               
Nobody loves you, Horace.       

35:44.892 --> 35:48.854
(RAUCOUS LAUGHTER)           
They just love your money.       

35:51.940 --> 35:53.984
(LAUGHTER)               

36:19.426 --> 36:23.555
Darling, let's leave it all behind! 
Oh, yes, let's!            

36:23.555 --> 36:26.725
To hell with the rotten world     
the grown-ups made for us.       

36:26.725 --> 36:30.103
Together we can build         
a new world of our own.        

36:31.688 --> 36:33.607
(APPLAUSE)               

37:11.812 --> 37:16.275
It's only a silly play, Harry.     
I dare say we've both survived     
much worse.              

37:22.030 --> 37:23.282
Rosalie!                

37:30.372 --> 37:33.292
My dear Mrs Selfridge,         
please try not to worry.        

37:33.292 --> 37:36.545
I shall see to it that this play    
closes within a week.         

37:38.046 --> 37:39.590
Good night.              

37:45.179 --> 37:48.348
Good evening, sir, Mrs Selfridge,   
Madam Selfridge.            

37:48.348 --> 37:52.436
Was the play to your taste?      
Not altogether, Fraser.        

37:52.436 --> 37:54.771
But it was an interesting evening.  

37:54.771 --> 37:57.232
It's long past our bedtimes.      
Shall we go up?            

37:57.232 --> 38:01.820
I'm not a child any more, Grandma,  
not after what I've heard and seen  
tonight.                

38:02.863 --> 38:05.282
Why didn't you tell me? Mother?    

38:05.282 --> 38:08.702
I'd still have hated you        
but at least I'd have understood!   

38:13.999 --> 38:16.710
I think I'll go to bed now too.    

38:16.710 --> 38:19.379
Stay.                 
No, if you don't mind.         

38:19.379 --> 38:21.757
I need a little time alone.      

38:59.628 --> 39:01.588
Rose, we can get through this.     

39:03.048 --> 39:05.842
Like Lady Mae said,          
it was just a silly play.       

39:05.842 --> 39:07.553
But it was the truth.         

39:09.888 --> 39:14.643
When I saw Rosalie           
tonight in the theatre         

39:17.563 --> 39:20.649
I just wanted to sink         
through the floor.           

39:22.234 --> 39:27.322
I felt so guilty            
and ashamed of myself.         

39:28.824 --> 39:31.827
You and the children          
are everything to me.         

39:31.827 --> 39:33.996
I'm lost without you.         

39:33.996 --> 39:36.540
You always say that, Harry.      

39:37.749 --> 39:42.421
So, where does it stand        
between you and me?          

39:44.590 --> 39:46.508
I don't know.             

39:47.384 --> 39:50.053
Are you going to leave me?       

39:50.053 --> 39:55.017
I have to go into the store tomorrow
and face all those people at 9am.   

39:57.728 --> 40:02.608
I don't think that I could do it    
if I didn't know I was coming home  
to you.                

40:05.903 --> 40:09.740
Then why do you need other women?   
I don't!                

40:12.034 --> 40:13.619
I'm just a...             

40:17.789 --> 40:19.124
I'm just a damn fool.         

40:20.334 --> 40:22.544
That's all and that's the truth.    

40:24.046 --> 40:26.965
I'm sorry, Harry.           

40:28.383 --> 40:30.385
We're leaving for Chicago.       

41:02.000 --> 41:05.879
Mr Selfridge! What you got to say?  
No comment.              

41:05.879 --> 41:09.174
What did you think of the play?    
Are you going to sue for libel?    

41:50.090 --> 41:52.384
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.      

41:54.887 --> 41:57.806
I guess you read the papers      
like everyone else.          

41:57.806 --> 41:59.308
I have, Mr Selfridge.         

41:59.308 --> 42:03.770
Heavy rain is forecast, so we're    
bringing forward umbrellas       
and rainwear.             

42:07.316 --> 42:09.151
If I might say, Mr Selfridge...    

42:12.237 --> 42:14.072
These things pass, you know.      

42:17.701 --> 42:19.786
Thank you, Crabb.           

43:04.248 --> 43:07.000
Bye!                  
Bye!                  

44:43.180 --> 44:46.058
Oh, er, sorry, Mr Selfridge.      

44:47.893 --> 44:49.895
George Towler, right?         

44:51.730 --> 44:53.607
That's right, Mr Selfridge.      

44:53.607 --> 44:56.485
I used to do your job         
once upon a time.           

44:57.611 --> 44:59.363
Remember that.             

44:59.363 --> 45:02.991
What, so you mean           
I could be like you one day?      

45:02.991 --> 45:05.744
You don't want to be like me,     
George.                

45:06.912 --> 45:09.623
But you've got everything,       
Mr Selfridge.             

45:09.623 --> 45:13.043
All this. And a lovely family too.  

45:18.131 --> 45:21.218
Night, Mr Towler.           
Keep up the good work.         

45:21.218 --> 45:23.679
Home safe, Mr Selfridge.        

45:24.305 --> 45:30.728
