Come on, get off those heels.

02:26.416 --> 02:27.708
Don't look at me. Am I the bag?

02:28.583 --> 02:29.791
-Get on there.
-John.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.083
Why you pushing the kid so hard for?

02:40.791 --> 02:42.083
He needs to be pushed.

02:42.666 --> 02:44.916
Fuck, just tone it down a bit, man.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.166
You're the boss.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.500
I'm gonna eat you for dinner.

03:02.291 --> 03:04.166
It's been three fucking weeks
and nothing.

03:04.708 --> 03:07.291
You bring me this cunt.
This fucking has-been.

03:07.375 --> 03:08.541
We looked everywhere.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.708
You can't have fucking looked everywhere.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.958
Okay, where the fuck is he?

03:13.416 --> 03:14.416
I swear.

03:14.708 --> 03:16.375
Swear to God, I don't know.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.083
I haven't seen him in months.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.250
This is Ibo.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.083
Fucking remember Ibo.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.333
This guy used to be top dog.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.958
Oh, look at him now.

03:30.291 --> 03:31.375
Fucking grub.

03:31.833 --> 03:33.791
Jail didn't do you no favors, idiot.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.125
I'm telling you man,

03:36.875 --> 03:38.250
I haven't seen him.

03:38.916 --> 03:41.500
Okay? The little prick,
he owes me five thousand.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.875
What's he owe you five grand for?

03:44.291 --> 03:45.916
They're my fucking drugs.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.458
-Put the motherfucker down.
-No wait...

03:54.083 --> 03:56.625
Maybe he got hit.
Maybe someone else has got our money.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.458
Oh, it's your fucking money, is it?

04:00.958 --> 04:03.208
Didn't know it was your fucking money.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.500
When did you start your business?

04:05.583 --> 04:07.125
-You in business now?
-Boss, boss--

04:07.291 --> 04:08.500
Shut the fuck up.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.166
Now you two better find me some answers.

04:11.541 --> 04:13.833
If the little fuck's dead,
bring me a body.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.375
But more than that,
I want my fucking money.

04:16.541 --> 04:17.833
-Boss!
-What?

04:20.250 --> 04:21.583
You fucking killed him?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.416
Did I tell you to kill him? Did I?

04:24.541 --> 04:25.833
I was trying to fucking tell ya.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.875
Are you that fucking retarded
you couldn't have just pulled him up?

04:31.125 --> 04:33.583
You know what, just get the fuck
out of my face.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.875
-Oi?
-What?

04:37.083 --> 04:38.625
Move the fucking body.

04:38.708 --> 04:39.791
Fuck, man.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.125
And find that little prick.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.583
Alive.

04:43.666 --> 04:45.916
First, go get me a fucking coffee
and a paper.

04:46.000 --> 04:46.916
I'll go get the coffee.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.750
What, you're not gonna fucking help me?

04:48.833 --> 04:50.375
No, I'm gonna get the fucking coffee.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.541
Fuck you then.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.416

05:16.541 --> 05:18.541
-Hey brother, how are you?
-Anyone follow you, man?

05:18.625 --> 05:19.625
No, no, no.

05:19.958 --> 05:21.500
Look man, what the fuck is going on?

05:21.583 --> 05:23.291
Nas and his boys
have been asking about ya.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.958
I got a few issues ya know,
nothing I can't handle.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.208
Shit.
Whatever it is bro.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.750
If I were you,
I'd go see Nas and work that shit out.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.000
I owe him money, G.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.458
If I turn up without it,
I'm a dead man, ya know.

05:33.541 --> 05:34.541
Fuck.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.333
Maybe leave town for a while, bro.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.666
Fuck that.
I'm not running.

05:40.625 --> 05:41.958
Just get me what I need, G.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.291
-I'll have it in a few days, yeah?
-For sure.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.166
Hey, they'll be watching you.

05:48.583 --> 05:49.625
So be careful.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.208
Shit, bro. I'm too smart
for those dumb asses, bro.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.833
-Don't worry, man.
-Love ya, G.

05:53.916 --> 05:55.875
-Take care, brother.
-I'll catch ya around, yeah?

05:55.958 --> 05:58.291
-Yeah. Be safe, man.
-Yeah. For sure. You too, bro.

05:58.375 --> 05:59.375
Yeah.

06:25.791 --> 06:26.916
What's this?

06:27.791 --> 06:30.000
I took the liberty of making
an appointment for you.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.125
I'm not going.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.500
Yes, you are.

06:33.166 --> 06:34.250
No, I'm not.

06:34.458 --> 06:35.583
Yes, you are.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.458
Good girl.

06:38.583 --> 06:39.583
Okay.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.791
Work the body, work the body.

06:57.833 --> 06:58.833
Low blow.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.833
Why weren't you
at the meeting last night?

07:08.791 --> 07:10.583
You were at that fucking gym again,
weren't ya?

07:11.958 --> 07:12.958
Yeah, so?

07:13.791 --> 07:15.916
You're just another paying
customer there, Mark.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.583
He's the best fucking trainer
in the district.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.750
That camel jockey, John?

07:23.250 --> 07:25.166
Mate, I can light his arse up any day
of the week

07:25.250 --> 07:27.041
-and you fucking know it. Hey!
-Bullshit.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.916
-That's bullshit. You know it.
-You fucking know it, mate.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.916
He's the best thing for my future.

07:33.291 --> 07:34.666
I'm your fucking brother.

07:35.458 --> 07:36.875
Who was there for ya the whole time

07:36.958 --> 07:38.291
you were getting your face
smacked in, pal?

07:38.416 --> 07:39.375
It was me.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.250
It's always fucking been me
and you know that.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.416
Do you wanna box?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.125
Yeah. Fuck yeah.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.208
All right.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.000
Find another gym, mate.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
What are you making?

08:40.707 --> 08:41.625
Fuck that.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.083
Why you talk to me like that for, man?

08:54.333 --> 08:55.208
What do you want, man?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.500
I'm looking for a job,
like you wanted, man.

09:11.791 --> 09:12.833
I don't wanna work with you, man.

09:16.375 --> 09:17.583
'Cause I don't want to.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.083
There's twenty minutes left.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.041
Do you wanna say anything?

10:09.125 --> 10:10.416
How do you know Wes?

10:10.666 --> 10:12.000
We met through a program

10:12.166 --> 10:14.666
working with troubled indigenous kids.

10:18.958 --> 10:21.666
You know he paid for this session
because he cares about you?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.625
How old was Charlie?

10:30.416 --> 10:31.500
Sixteen.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.125
Young man.

10:35.041 --> 10:36.083
You must miss him?

10:42.125 --> 10:43.416
We're just talking.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.208
My brother's dead.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.500
My mother left and went back
to Lebanon for good.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.000
They're just dreams.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.708
I've been having them for years.

11:05.375 --> 11:07.041
Haven't put a gun to my head yet.

11:10.291 --> 11:11.416
There ya go.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.625
Got any solutions?

11:18.958 --> 11:22.250
I can't imagine your mom
wanting nothing to do with you.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.125
You don't remember me, do you?

11:26.375 --> 11:28.500
I worked with your mother at Lashish.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.875
I served you and your wife.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.458
She was very beautiful.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.208
Yeah, well she's gone.

11:40.958 --> 11:41.958
So am I.

11:43.375 --> 11:44.375
Thanks.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.666
So, you walked out on her, eh?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.875
I'm done. I quit.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.416
You're not quitting.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.791
I know you lost your brother,
that sucks.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.166
But you didn't kill him.

12:09.666 --> 12:11.541
Well, I flushed the drugs
down the toilet.

12:12.916 --> 12:15.125
Bullshit.
We paid the money.

12:15.208 --> 12:16.708
I was there, remember?

12:18.250 --> 12:19.500
Should've killed the dog.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.583
Should've killed him.

12:22.583 --> 12:25.208
Think that would have made you
feel better? Hey?

12:25.666 --> 12:26.791
You need help.

12:27.541 --> 12:29.250
Hey? And these pills.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.125
Found them on the desk,
you left there.

12:32.541 --> 12:33.541
Yeah.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.250
You're not quitting.

12:37.833 --> 12:38.791
No, you're not.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.583
You're gonna get your life back in order.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.458
Okay? Go back to work.

12:43.708 --> 12:44.708
Yeah?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.666
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, John.

12:49.625 --> 12:52.541
Because you'll be with this on your own.
Okay?

12:55.625 --> 12:57.083
It's all in your head, eh?

13:02.375 --> 13:03.541
Need a cuddle?

13:05.958 --> 13:07.125
Want a cuddle?

13:13.083 --> 13:14.583
I'll make us a cuppa.

13:18.041 --> 13:20.916
Firstly, I wanna thank all you supporters

13:21.000 --> 13:23.166
who have been in this thing
right from the beginning.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.375
I know you are making sacrifices
to be here.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.916
On this stinking bastard
of a hot day.

13:29.625 --> 13:33.250
A time is coming where you might need
to make an even greater sacrifice.

13:34.625 --> 13:38.666
We're on the edge of losing everything
that was great

13:38.750 --> 13:40.000
about Australia.

13:40.458 --> 13:44.416
It's time, ladies and gentlemen,
to put a stop to the Islamization

13:44.500 --> 13:45.833
of this beautiful country.

13:45.916 --> 13:47.708
Now, the government's
not gonna help us.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.458
So, it's up to us, the people,

13:50.833 --> 13:52.500
to stand up and be heard.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.583
This is our land.

13:54.666 --> 13:57.041
-Our land!
-Now, even our own Vegemite

13:57.208 --> 13:58.458
is now made Halal.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.375
We've got boat loads
of illegal immigrants

14:01.458 --> 14:02.958
coming to these fair shores.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.375
And what do the government do?

14:04.458 --> 14:06.875
-Nothing.
-No. They do worse than nothing.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.416
They give them a house,
they give them benefits,

14:09.541 --> 14:13.458
while you hardworking Aussies
work your arses off, pay your taxes

14:13.541 --> 14:16.125
just so these wog bastards can benefit.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.666
Well, you know what I say to that?

14:17.833 --> 14:20.041
-Fuck that!
-I don't just say fuck that.

14:20.125 --> 14:23.750
-I say no more!
-No more. No more.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.916
It is time to reclaim this country,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.208
Reclaim the great southern land

14:29.291 --> 14:31.541
that our fathers, our grandfathers,

14:31.625 --> 14:35.333
and our great grandfathers
fought on the shores of Gallipoli

14:35.416 --> 14:36.708
and died for!

14:36.833 --> 14:39.250
-Are you with me?
-Yeah!

14:39.333 --> 14:41.458
-Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!
-Oi, oi, oi.

14:41.541 --> 14:43.958
Now lest go do and this
for the great southern cross.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.666
-Thank you for coming.
-Fuck yeah!

14:46.750 --> 14:48.916
That cunt speaks the fucking truth.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yes!

15:27.791 --> 15:28.708
John?

15:28.875 --> 15:30.750
I'm sorry, did we have another session?

15:31.083 --> 15:32.541
No, no.

15:32.833 --> 15:33.708
Um...

15:34.125 --> 15:35.875
I owe you an apology
for the other day.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.125
-No, you don't.
-Yeah, yeah, I do.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.208
I, um...

15:40.375 --> 15:42.166
I shouldn't have walked out
on ya like that.

15:42.791 --> 15:44.333
It was a shitty thing to do.

15:45.541 --> 15:46.708
That's okay.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.750
Um, I was thinking maybe,

15:49.833 --> 15:51.666
if you want to, I don't know...

15:52.750 --> 15:53.875
maybe some dinner.

15:54.291 --> 15:55.375
That's a really sweet gesture.

15:55.541 --> 15:57.208
But, I don't date clients.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.333
I'm not a client.

16:02.166 --> 16:03.333
And it's not a date.

16:03.958 --> 16:04.958
Either way,

16:05.875 --> 16:07.416
no need.
Apology accepted.

16:09.791 --> 16:12.208
You know, I'll just keep coming back
until you say yes.

16:13.375 --> 16:14.291
You a stalker?

16:15.791 --> 16:16.833
I think I am.

16:17.916 --> 16:18.916
Yeah.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.041
Might need help with that.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.125
You eat Thai?

16:25.875 --> 16:27.166
Saturday, seven o'clock.

16:28.041 --> 16:29.583
Just down the road from Lashish.

16:30.958 --> 16:33.583
-See you then, okay?
-I don't date clients.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.250
I'm not a client.

16:46.916 --> 16:47.916
Come on.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Left.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.375
Left, right.

16:52.416 --> 16:54.000
Ah, there ya go. There ya go.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.416
Hey Mark, let's go. Get your stuff.

16:58.916 --> 17:00.291
-Let's go.
-Yeah, I'll be done in ten.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.916
No, mate. You're done now. Let's go.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.665
That's my brother, Bryan.

17:09.583 --> 17:10.583
John.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.665
You box?

17:25.458 --> 17:27.415
Notice how this gym smells like shit.

17:30.958 --> 17:34.500
Yeah, it's when you mix the ethnic
and the Arab and the Abo.

17:35.375 --> 17:38.291
Hey, fellas.
Please, just leave.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.458
Is falafel is getting angry?

17:42.125 --> 17:43.375
Talk later, John.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.625
-Mark.
-See ya, bro.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.666
-Yeah. See you, Wes.
-He's not your bro.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.208
You black cunt.

17:50.416 --> 17:51.875
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:52.916 --> 17:54.958
Door, door. Out. Out.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.125
Stay the fuck away from my brother, mate.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.416
Door. Out.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.000
What are you looking at? Fuck.

18:01.416 --> 18:02.416
Fuck.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.458
What the fuck happened then?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.875
You gonna let some white redneck
piece of shit come into our gym

18:07.958 --> 18:09.375
and disrespect us like that?

18:09.541 --> 18:11.791
But that's not what we show
the kids here.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.000
We don't train them that.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.916
And in this gym, we don't train
what happened here.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.000
Do you's understand that?

18:20.458 --> 18:21.791
Yes, Wes.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.833
Okay, back to it.
Thank you.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.875
You know, we're teaching them boxing.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.250
They're learning to hit people.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.125
Yeah, but with some self-control.

18:34.666 --> 18:36.166
Which you didn't have.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.458
Fuck self-control, man.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.333
How 'bout some self-respect?

18:43.125 --> 18:44.916
He called you a black cunt to your face.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.333
I mean, the whole fucking gym heard it.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.416
Yeah, they did.

18:50.708 --> 18:53.375
Yeah.
I've been called names all me life.

18:53.500 --> 18:58.041
Bonga, nigger, coon, monkey, gorilla.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.458
Ya know, you don't see me going around
belting people up.

19:01.666 --> 19:03.083
I wouldn't be sitting here.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.166
What?

19:40.833 --> 19:42.166
You're an ass.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.416
Shut up, ya dog.

19:45.916 --> 19:47.041
Oh.

19:47.916 --> 19:49.666
Oh, God, that's hilarious.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.125
Wanna puff?

20:10.583 --> 20:11.833
No, I'm good.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.583
So, what we gonna do
about that John prick?

20:16.666 --> 20:18.083
Mate, don't even start.

20:18.166 --> 20:21.916
You guys walk into the gym,
disrespect the owner, disrespect me.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.375
There's fucking kids in there.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.833
Did you not hear what Malcolm said?

20:27.125 --> 20:28.791
Sacrifices have to be made.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.291
We have to take back what's ours.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.250
What do you mean ours?

20:36.291 --> 20:37.416
Look around.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.250
This place used to be all white.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.500
How many white faces
do you see in the street now?

20:42.916 --> 20:44.875
You're a dickhead, Rick.
It's not ours anyway,

20:44.958 --> 20:47.791
-unless you're Indigenous.
-Here we fuckin' go.

20:49.125 --> 20:50.208
Think about it, mate.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.708
Those coons came over here
from Africa

20:54.250 --> 20:56.708
and took over the place
from whoever the fuck was here.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.083
They didn't even have houses, mate.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.375
And have look at 'em now.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.250
They're fuckin' drunks.

21:03.916 --> 21:05.458
They rape their kids.

21:06.291 --> 21:07.791
They live off our fucking taxes.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.166
That's bullshit, Bryan.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.583
White people do the same thing.

21:11.708 --> 21:13.000
Not like they do, mate.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.666
If I was living in America,

21:18.291 --> 21:21.041
I'd build a wall
to keep the fuckin' Mexicans out, too.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.041
Fuck, we should do that here, mate.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.166
Big wall all the way around the outside.

21:28.708 --> 21:29.833
Keep the cunts out.

21:30.833 --> 21:31.833
Hey?

21:35.958 --> 21:36.958
Anyway...

21:38.625 --> 21:39.833
I'm gonna crash.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.708
-See you.
-Bye.

21:47.166 --> 21:48.208
Bryan, mate.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.541
Your brother really likes
that John cunt, hey?

21:51.875 --> 21:52.916
You think?

21:53.333 --> 21:54.791
He has a hard on for him.

21:58.541 --> 21:59.666
He gets it, mate.

22:00.958 --> 22:02.083
Don't worry about that.

22:05.875 --> 22:07.333
That Leb will be dealt with.

22:10.750 --> 22:11.750
They all will.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.125
This is fucking war.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.375
Hoo-ha.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.208
Can I help?

22:33.750 --> 22:34.875
Is Mo home?

22:35.458 --> 22:36.916
No, he's not yet.

22:41.416 --> 22:42.416
Check it out.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.958
Excuse me.

22:48.916 --> 22:50.583
How long have you been in this country?

22:50.958 --> 22:54.250
-Huh?
-We speak English here. Huh?

22:55.166 --> 22:56.833
Oh, fuck me dead.
You talk to them.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.458
How much?

23:04.541 --> 23:06.458
Hundred thousand dollars.

23:06.583 --> 23:09.458
-One hundred dollar?
-Oh, fuck this.

23:09.666 --> 23:11.208
No. Please.

23:11.291 --> 23:13.125
-No, please.
-We'll pay.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.500
-We'll get you the money. Please.
-No, please.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.000
You see?

23:17.333 --> 23:19.416
Everyone understands gun language.

23:19.750 --> 23:21.375
It's an international language.

23:21.666 --> 23:22.666
No.

23:23.416 --> 23:24.416
Now.

23:25.875 --> 23:29.291
This is gonna hurt a little bit,
but it's a message for your son.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.500
You deliver to him? Huh?

23:39.875 --> 23:41.458
Shh, shh, shh.

23:46.541 --> 23:47.833
Check his face out.

23:49.291 --> 23:50.291
Shh, shh, shh.

23:51.041 --> 23:54.500
Tell your worthless son
to return what's mine, okay?

23:54.583 --> 23:56.541
I don't wanna have to come back.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.750
Shh, shh, shh.
Hush now. Hush now.

24:00.458 --> 24:01.791
It's only a leg wound.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.041
-No police, huh?
-No.

24:04.125 --> 24:07.083
No. No police. No, no. No good.

24:07.375 --> 24:08.375
Anything?

24:10.166 --> 24:11.166
Let's go.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.583
Piece of shit.

25:13.416 --> 25:14.583
Thank you.

25:36.375 --> 25:37.333
You're late.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.833
I felt sorry for you.

25:55.833 --> 25:57.083
I spoke to mom today.

25:57.666 --> 25:58.791
Is she liking Lebanon?

25:59.541 --> 26:00.541
She's happy.

26:08.041 --> 26:09.625
So, tell me.
What's your story?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.333
What do you wanna know?

26:18.791 --> 26:20.375
Why ain't you married?

26:20.875 --> 26:25.000
Usually, Leb girls your age are married
and running around with six kids.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.875
Maybe if I lived in a village
somewhere in Lebanon.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.791
I was engaged to a guy from Lebanon.

26:34.458 --> 26:36.458
I couldn't do it.
I barely knew him.

26:37.375 --> 26:39.916
He wasn't a cousin, was he?
He was?

26:43.083 --> 26:45.083
Well, at least you're keeping it
in the family.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.375
Shut up.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.750
I don't have much luck with men.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.500
I was dating my brother's best friend

26:51.625 --> 26:53.333
and broke it off three months ago.

26:53.416 --> 26:54.458
What happened?

26:54.666 --> 26:55.666
Caught him cheating...

26:56.875 --> 26:58.125
with my best friend.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.583
That's fucked.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.375
Was she hot, at least?

27:05.041 --> 27:06.416
That is not funny.

27:06.958 --> 27:07.833
It's a joke.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.125
You're laughing.

27:09.583 --> 27:10.833
This is not a real laugh.

27:12.291 --> 27:14.083
So, what happened with your ex?

27:14.541 --> 27:15.875
After my brother's death...

27:17.375 --> 27:18.791
I became very distant.

27:20.458 --> 27:21.708
We just grew apart.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.458
One day, I come home after work
and she was gone.

27:27.458 --> 27:28.833
Did you try to find her?

27:29.791 --> 27:30.833
No.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.791
I figured she'd made her decision.

27:35.041 --> 27:36.125
You hungry?

27:37.625 --> 27:38.875
Yeah, I can eat.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.541
Yeah. Let's eat.

27:44.416 --> 27:47.041
I am a barbecue beef kind of girl.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.958
What would you like?

27:50.375 --> 27:51.791
I don't know what I want.

27:54.208 --> 27:55.208
Hmm.

27:57.041 --> 27:58.125
Okay.

27:58.833 --> 28:00.000
I'll order.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.166
Hey, give me some of that.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.125
Why would she call you back,
you dickhead?

28:13.875 --> 28:14.958
I'm fucking starving.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.625
Hey, hey, hey.
What have we got here?

28:16.750 --> 28:18.041
Going for a stroll, towel-head?

28:18.125 --> 28:19.791
Hey, rag head.
Wanna get through?

28:20.208 --> 28:22.041
Take that of your head,
and we'll let you through.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.666
-Wanna get through?
-Yes.

28:23.833 --> 28:26.083
Why do you wear that shit on your head?
This is fucking Australia.

28:26.541 --> 28:27.958
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.666
Take that shit off.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.083
-I was born here.
-You and your kind can fuck off

28:32.166 --> 28:33.500
back to where you came from.

28:33.791 --> 28:34.916
This is fucking Australia.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.083
Fuck you looking at?
Fuck you looking at?

28:37.166 --> 28:39.083
Fuck off, you Asian sluts.
You wanna go too, huh?

28:39.166 --> 28:41.750
-Fucking chink sluts.
-Keep walking, you Asian fuck sluts.

28:41.916 --> 28:44.666
-Are you guys for real? Just let me go.
-No. You and your kind can fuck off

28:44.750 --> 28:46.625
-back to where you came from.
-I was born here.

28:49.333 --> 28:50.416
Stop it, please.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.000
See, how do you like that?

28:58.041 --> 28:59.958
Don't, don't, please, please.

29:03.791 --> 29:04.833
Yeah!

29:04.916 --> 29:06.083
Fucking mine!

29:07.500 --> 29:08.875
-Mine now!
-Fuck you looking at?

29:09.291 --> 29:11.375
Fuck off you cunts,
this is none of your fucking business.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.458
-Hey, the fucking cops are coming, mate.
-All right.

29:13.541 --> 29:14.708
-Is she all right?
-She's fine.

29:14.791 --> 29:16.750
What are you gonna do,
throw a phone at us?

29:20.208 --> 29:21.375
Let's go, boys.

29:21.916 --> 29:23.041
You all right, darling?

29:25.416 --> 29:26.416
Look away!

29:34.250 --> 29:36.000
So, did I earn myself a second date?

29:36.125 --> 29:38.750
Hey, what happened to one dinner
and it's not a date?

29:41.333 --> 29:42.416
I lied.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.583
Ah, you lied?

29:45.333 --> 29:47.083
A little white lie never hurt no one.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.750
I can actually roll with that.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.666
-You can, can ya?
-Hmm.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.291
Listen, we just shouldn't, okay?

29:54.875 --> 29:56.041
You know your problem?

29:56.708 --> 29:57.833
What's my problem?

29:57.958 --> 29:59.416
You think too much.

30:01.458 --> 30:03.791
Ah, this Muslim Christian thing,

30:03.875 --> 30:05.875
it's a bit of a situation-ship.

30:08.250 --> 30:09.625
Situation-ship?

30:12.125 --> 30:13.333
I like that.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.500
-You do?
-Yeah, I do.

30:17.875 --> 30:19.083
It's tempting.

31:02.750 --> 31:04.791
I'm fucking over this shit.

31:04.916 --> 31:06.166
The burgers?
They're fucking great.

31:06.416 --> 31:08.708
Not the fucking burgers,
you numb skull.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.583
-What then?
-This shit.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.625
No honor anymore.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.500
Fucking hoods.

31:27.166 --> 31:29.583
That fucking weird faggot shit
he goes on with.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.875
Yeah, he gets a bit like that sometimes.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.625
Tell ya what.
I wanna fucking knock him.

31:36.083 --> 31:38.750
They reckon you need 1.2
in super to retire.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.500
I've got 1.9.

31:41.958 --> 31:45.500
After this job, I'm fucking out.
I'm out.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.541
You can't, you know that.

31:48.625 --> 31:51.916
-One way in, one way out.
-I'm fucking out, all right. I'm out.

31:52.291 --> 31:53.916
And don't you fucking say a word.

31:54.666 --> 31:55.875
You owe me, remember?

31:56.458 --> 31:57.583
Remember?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.291
I remember.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.041
My own kids are scared of me.

32:09.541 --> 32:11.166
Gonna miss Jimmy's, though.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.958
I'm gonna fucking miss you.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.291
One, two, three.

33:30.916 --> 33:33.250
-John, help me. Help me.
-What's going on?

33:33.333 --> 33:34.666
-They're trying to kill me.
-Who?

33:34.750 --> 33:35.666
Some guys, man.

33:36.583 --> 33:37.750
This isn't your business.

33:38.208 --> 33:39.708
We just want the kid.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.041

34:40.333 --> 34:41.458

40:34.291 --> 40:35.916
I'm not attracted to him.

40:36.708 --> 40:39.541
And he's an import.
I said no imports.

40:39.625 --> 40:42.375
He can't speak English
and he has more hair on his eyebrow

40:42.458 --> 40:44.125

40:44.458 --> 40:46.250
He learn English. Then...

40:46.666 --> 40:48.708

40:49.625 --> 40:51.208
And give him a chance.

40:51.541 --> 40:52.958

41:07.375 --> 41:09.750
Who's this?

41:09.833 --> 41:10.958
It's a client.

41:15.916 --> 41:16.958
One eyebrow?

41:19.916 --> 41:21.833
I mean, it makes me feel desperate.

41:22.541 --> 41:24.375
-Have you told them that?
-Yes.

41:24.458 --> 41:25.666
Yeah?

41:25.750 --> 41:28.666
I don't want to get married
for the sake of getting married.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.833
I want to find someone who I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.041

41:35.416 --> 41:37.166

41:37.875 --> 41:39.500
someone who'd die for me.

41:40.833 --> 41:44.666
Got mates who got married overseas
and they're like a baby factory.

41:45.625 --> 41:46.708

41:46.833 --> 41:49.583
-Why what?
-Why did you have to be Christian?

41:53.625 --> 41:55.750
This is so wrong.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.208

42:16.375 --> 42:19.166

Come on, Kid.

51:58.875 --> 52:01.041
Okay, he's done. Now finish him
when he gets on his feet.

52:01.166 --> 52:02.208
If he gets on his feet.

52:02.291 --> 52:03.791
-Once more?
-Finish him off, Kid. Finish him off.

52:03.875 --> 52:04.875
Hey. All right.

52:04.958 --> 52:05.958
Go.

52:07.666 --> 52:08.583
That's it.

52:09.250 --> 52:10.916
All right. Let's go.

52:11.583 --> 52:13.041
Fucking knock his head off.

52:13.750 --> 52:14.875
Get him!

52:22.458 --> 52:23.625
Come on, hurt him.

52:25.708 --> 52:26.791
Come on.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.208
-Yes.
-Yeah, that's right.

52:34.375 --> 52:35.875
That's fucking right.

52:37.708 --> 52:39.875
-Show him. Fucking show him.
-What we trained, remember?

52:39.958 --> 52:41.541
-Remember.
-Get him!

52:44.416 --> 52:45.416
Come on.

52:53.416 --> 52:54.791
Finish him off.

52:55.166 --> 52:57.875
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

52:58.208 --> 53:00.458
-Hit him. Yes, get him John.
-What are you bloody doing?

53:00.541 --> 53:02.250
Get him! Get him! Hit him! Yes!

53:02.333 --> 53:04.375
-Get up!
-Fucking finish him!

53:04.458 --> 53:06.083
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

53:06.625 --> 53:07.625
Come on, Kid.

53:09.125 --> 53:10.291
Come on, yes!

53:10.541 --> 53:11.541
Yeah!

53:11.625 --> 53:12.666
Fucking hell.

53:13.375 --> 53:14.583
Yes!

53:14.750 --> 53:16.166
Ding, fucking ding.

53:16.375 --> 53:18.083
Yes!

53:32.291 --> 53:33.333
One week.

53:34.333 --> 53:35.250
I want my money.

54:05.541 --> 54:08.041
Babe, you gotta go to the cops.

54:08.750 --> 54:09.833
No police.

54:11.291 --> 54:12.375
He's right.

54:13.333 --> 54:15.666
They don't care about the kids
in this neighborhood.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.833
I know a fed that we can talk to.

54:19.375 --> 54:20.375
Amira.

54:20.458 --> 54:21.916
You grew up here.

54:22.708 --> 54:23.916
Look around ya.

54:24.166 --> 54:26.416
Drive-by's, drugs, gangs.

54:27.375 --> 54:29.458
You think the cops don't know
what's going on?

54:30.458 --> 54:32.375
Been through this with Charlie.

54:38.291 --> 54:39.666
What are we gonna do?

54:40.916 --> 54:42.000
Find Mo.

54:43.166 --> 54:44.250
And what about the money?

54:45.833 --> 54:47.166
Let's just find Mo.

55:30.333 --> 55:31.500
I got the money.

55:33.083 --> 55:34.083
No.

55:35.666 --> 55:36.875
No, no.

55:39.583 --> 55:40.708
I wanna help you.

55:41.541 --> 55:42.541
Let me.

55:44.625 --> 55:45.875
I'm not paying.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.875
Last time I paid, my brother died.

55:52.125 --> 55:54.500
I'm not making the same mistake again.

55:57.708 --> 55:59.000
You're beautiful.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.125
Come on.

57:14.625 --> 57:15.625
Hey, Amira.

57:16.125 --> 57:17.625
You gonna tell Mom and Dad?

57:17.958 --> 57:19.958
-Tell them what?
-I don't know.

57:20.166 --> 57:21.125
About your boyfriend?

57:21.750 --> 57:22.958
What are you talking about?

57:23.666 --> 57:26.000
-Amira, who was that guy you were with?
-What guy?

57:26.250 --> 57:27.500
We've seen you.

57:27.750 --> 57:29.250
Have you been following me?

57:29.458 --> 57:31.625
-Yeah. So?
-I knew it.

57:31.916 --> 57:33.375
I knew you were up to no good.

57:51.416 --> 57:54.041
-Amira, what are you thinking?
-Oh, please. You should talk.

57:54.416 --> 57:56.458
What about the Italian girl
that you've been seeing?

58:03.916 --> 58:05.208
You know what? You speak to him again,

58:05.375 --> 58:06.958
I'm gonna personally hurt him.
Is that understood?

58:18.208 --> 58:19.375
Mom, he's a good man.

58:28.333 --> 58:30.250
Papa, I just wanna marry someone I love.

59:14.333 --> 59:15.333
Malcolm.

59:17.458 --> 59:18.750
Malcolm, how are you, mate?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.291
Do you want a drink or something?

59:27.333 --> 59:28.708
What the fuck are you up to, Bryan?

59:29.166 --> 59:30.541
Are you killing people now?

59:32.166 --> 59:34.541
Didn't fucking kill anyone, mate.
I got no idea what you're talking about.

59:34.666 --> 59:36.791
I just had young Matt on my doorstep.

59:37.416 --> 59:40.375
And he gave me an insight into the manner
in which you decided

59:40.916 --> 59:43.875
to take things upon yourself
in representing the organization in.

59:44.125 --> 59:45.458
At least I'm doing something.

59:45.541 --> 59:46.791
Fuck, something.

59:47.791 --> 59:51.208
I got these bastard press reporters
all over us looking for a slip up.

59:52.916 --> 59:54.666
This is not about beating up women.

59:55.166 --> 59:58.958
and it's sure as fuck not about fucking
knifing people in alleyways.

59:59.416 --> 01:00:01.125
This is a legitimate political movement

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:03.583
that is gonna change the face
of this nation.

01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:04.875
Yeah.

01:00:05.666 --> 01:00:07.458
And I'm the only one fucking moving.

01:00:07.541 --> 01:00:08.833
Fuck your movements.

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:11.541
I could be prime minister of this place
one day.

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.583
You think I wanna be associated
with this kind of shit?

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:16.666
Prime minister my arse, mate.

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:19.500
Forget it. Pull your bloody head in.

01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:22.875
Actually, you know what?

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:26.500
You are fucking out.
You're fucking out.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.833
You think it's gonna make a difference?
Huh?

01:00:31.208 --> 01:00:34.708
You've been preaching your shit,
and nothing's fucking changed, right?

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:35.958
Fuck that.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:39.083
I'm actually gonna get out there
and I'm gonna take this shit

01:00:39.166 --> 01:00:40.791
into my fucking hands.

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.625
I'm gonna make these cunts listen right.

01:00:44.166 --> 01:00:47.083
White fucking Australia.

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.083
Yeah!

01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:41.416
Remember us?

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:44.958
We'll teach you to show us
the fucking door.

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:47.666
Where is he?

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.916
Where the fuck is he, gorilla?

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.750
You fucking Abo's.

01:01:56.708 --> 01:01:58.708
We give you everything, don't we, hey?

01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:01.083
All you fucking do is whinge and complain.

01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:02.875
You're a fucking cave man.

01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:04.458
Where is he?

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:06.500
Oi!

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:08.750
I'm here.

01:02:10.625 --> 01:02:11.875
Here we fucking go.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:14.458
You like baseball rag head?

01:02:17.083 --> 01:02:19.791
You slippery Arab cunt.

01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:24.583
My turn.

01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:30.875
Fuck!

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.458
John, don't.

01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:36.666
Fuck off.
Fuck off.

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:39.416
Get the fuck out of here.

01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:52.416
Please, God keep you. God keep you.

01:04:19.666 --> 01:04:20.708
-Jimmy.
-Johnny.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:24.416
Number 13.

01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:29.500
Here you go, Mark.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:30.958
-Look after yourself, brother.
-Thanks, man.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:31.916
Be safe.

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:37.458
Mark!

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:43.416
So, tell me.
How does a person go into a place

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.166
with his mates and beat up an old man?

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.125
Why?

01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:51.625
'Cause he ain't white?

01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:54.583
I didn't do anything, John.

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:56.416
Exactly.

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:58.041
You did nothing.

01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:11.041
So how did they find out?

01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:14.333
Brothers saw us together.

01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:16.916
What did they say?

01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:18.708
End it.

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:20.708
What'd you say?

01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:22.958
Come on.

01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:26.791
We both knew this wasn't going to be easy.

01:05:27.833 --> 01:05:29.916
-I don't do easy.
-Yeah, well.

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:31.708
I'm Muslim and you're Christian.

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.541
So you keep telling me.

01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:36.041
Why can't we be together?

01:05:36.291 --> 01:05:38.333
I mean it's not as though
I'm asking you to convert?

01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:39.666
Will you?

01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:42.708
No.

01:05:43.458 --> 01:05:44.583
Does it bother you?

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.958
I don't want you to change a thing.

01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:51.416
Not a thing.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.458
What about kids?

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:01.708
We'll figure that out. You and me.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.250
Try telling that to my parents.

01:06:05.666 --> 01:06:06.791
You want me to?

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:09.958
Look. We just gotta be discreet.

01:06:13.916 --> 01:06:15.375
I know what I want, okay.

01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:18.541
But the question is...

01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:20.375
what is it you want?

01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:28.000
Here's ya fucking burgers.

01:06:28.916 --> 01:06:31.125
Oi! What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:39.208
What happened to his arm? Hmm?

01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:43.000
What happened to your fucking arm?

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.208
Fucking hurt it playing baseball.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:48.833
You attack an old man?

01:06:50.541 --> 01:06:53.458
-It's all for the cause mate.
-No, fuck you and fuck your cause.

01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:56.791
Malcolm said you're fucking out.
You fucking idiot.

01:06:57.291 --> 01:06:58.333
Fuck Malcolm.

01:06:58.541 --> 01:06:59.625
I'll show him.

01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:01.583
I'm just getting started, mate.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.500
We are just beginning.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:06.625
This fucking government
and its political fucking correctness.

01:07:06.708 --> 01:07:08.500
-Oh, fucking hell.
-You gotta tip toe around

01:07:08.583 --> 01:07:10.250
-like a fucking faggot.
-Bullshit.

01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:12.458
While they build their mosques
and prayer halls, mate.

01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:14.708
-Listen to yourself.
-You walk down the shops now mate,

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:16.666
and it's like playing spot the Aussie.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:18.375
We are the minority.

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:21.916
If anyone gets in my way,
I'll fucking kill them.

01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:23.666
Yeah, I got that.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.916
Hey. Where you going?

01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:30.375
Don't you want your burger?

01:07:32.833 --> 01:07:33.708
Fuck ya.

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:36.250
Fucking love these burgers.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:39.291
Jimmy's mate. Best fucking burgers.

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:41.125
Hey, swing us me chips.

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:47.291
You spoken to Mo?

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:55.041
They were innocent, man.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.083
Want some of this?

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:08.041
Sure. Thanks, man.

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:13.500
Hey John.

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:17.457
-Oi! Hey, what the fuck is going on?
-Shut your fucking mouths.

01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:21.541
You. Come here.

01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:22.875
What the fuck?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.250
Take me to Mo now.

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.875
Open your fucking mouth
and I'll break your fucking jaw

01:08:28.957 --> 01:08:30.291
then I'll drag you to him.

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:33.041
I don't know where he is brother.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:36.457
Give me that. Move.
Get out of here, come on. Move.

01:08:36.582 --> 01:08:37.582
Relax, brother.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.291
The fuck you doing sneaking up
like that, man? I almost shot ya.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.791
What the fuck is he doing here?

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:58.291
Ya heard?

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:00.291
Yeah, I heard.

01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:05.582
It's alright, man.

01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:08.207
I'm gonna kill him.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:24.875
The money was never stolen was it?

01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:26.666
Fuck Nas, man.

01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:28.957
I've been dealing drugs for him for years.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.875
I made him a lot of money.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:32.875
All right. I'm taking what's owed to me.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.416
I earned this money. It's my money.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:38.500
This isn't your fucking money.

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:40.750
It's my money.

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:42.125
And it's staying here.

01:09:42.416 --> 01:09:43.875
Is that what your parents are worth?

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.666
-A lousy hundred fucking grand?
-Brother, you don't know me all right.

01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:49.832
All the boys used to put on me.

01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:52.541
They used to call me you little bitch,
you little gronk this that, brother.

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:54.500
No one is gonna put it on me, no more.

01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:56.541
Not you, not him, not no one.

01:09:57.291 --> 01:09:58.958
We're here to help you, brother.

01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:00.875
That's blood money.

01:10:04.916 --> 01:10:07.958
Brother, Charlie told us
all the bad shit you done, right.

01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:09.333
Don't lecture me.

01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:12.250
Yeah, I fucking paid the price.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:15.166
Three fucking years in maximum security.

01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:17.583
But I learnt my fucking lesson.

01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:20.875
What have you learnt
since what happened to Charlie, huh?

01:10:21.625 --> 01:10:22.708
Fucking nothing.

01:10:22.958 --> 01:10:25.958
Brother, fuck you, fuck him and fuck life.

01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:29.416
The system is made for us to fail.

01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:33.083
How many boys you know grow up
to become doctors, lawyers? Zero, brother.

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:35.750
All the boys I know,
they're dead or locked up.

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.000
There's no choice for us, brother.
There's no choice.

01:10:39.666 --> 01:10:40.708
You hear this bullshit?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.166
Am I supposed to feel sorry for ya?

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:44.583
Well boo-fucking-hoo.

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.916
Everyone has a fucking choice.

01:10:48.833 --> 01:10:50.750
You're one of those fucking losers right?

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.750
That blames everything but himself.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.541
I'm taking the fucking money.

01:11:04.416 --> 01:11:05.458
Hey!

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.000
He has to pay.

01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:13.750
You think I won't do it?

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:16.333
I'll do it.

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.625
Carrying a gun is one thing.

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:21.666
Pulling the trigger, taking a life.

01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:23.708
Well that's another.

01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:26.166
Go home and bury your parents.

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:28.875
Then disappear for good.

01:11:29.958 --> 01:11:33.125
Abo, we ain't done yet. Let's go.

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:35.208
Come on, brother.

01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:38.083
Let's go.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:43.791
I'll be back, yeah?

01:11:49.166 --> 01:11:50.416
It's my money.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:53.125
It's my money.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.791
They killed my mum.

01:11:58.416 --> 01:11:59.791
They killed my dad.

01:12:02.291 --> 01:12:03.583
It's my money.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.875
Hot day mate. Bring your swimmers?

01:12:23.166 --> 01:12:24.208
Good.

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:25.750
Where's Mo?

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.000
Well, so the money
just appeared like magic?

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:32.333
Look. What's between you and Mo,

01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:34.041
has nothing to do with me.

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:36.000
We good?

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.791
No. We ain't fucking good.

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:40.875
Brought you the money. I'm done.

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:42.583
You're done

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.041
when I say you're fucking done.

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:48.416
Bring me Mo, then we're done.

01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:49.666
I did what you asked.

01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:52.125
You know who the fuck I am?

01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:54.500
Do you wanna fuck with me?

01:12:56.291 --> 01:12:58.041
You wanna fuck with me?

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.333
Like I said, I'm done.

01:13:04.666 --> 01:13:05.916
Fuck.

01:13:06.041 --> 01:13:07.375
You believe this prick?

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:09.666
You know what? Fuck him.

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:12.458
Kill them all.

01:13:12.875 --> 01:13:13.916
I want John.

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:17.500
You think you can handle him this time?

01:13:18.208 --> 01:13:20.291
I'm gonna make him drown in his own blood.

01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:21.458
Good.

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:23.333
Because if you don't,

01:13:23.541 --> 01:13:26.125
I'm gonna drown you
in your own fucking blood.

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.250
How did it go?

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:37.291
-It's all sorted.
-Yeah?

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:38.625
Shit really?

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:41.291
-Man. I don't know how you do it, bro.
-It's not safe.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.500
You tell him to disappear.

01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:44.000
-Yeah.
-I mean it.

01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:46.541
Yeah, okay, bro. It's all good, man.

01:13:48.166 --> 01:13:50.375
What the fuck do these goons want?

01:14:03.791 --> 01:14:05.458
Down.

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:46.791
I got an idea.

01:14:47.625 --> 01:14:48.541
What?

01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:50.625
Let's just go.

01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:54.583
Elope?

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:58.208
Yeah. Let's just get out of here.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.458
I'm so sick of all this shit.

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:04.833
Just start a new life.

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:08.416
You're serious aren't you?

01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:11.625
Yeah.

01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:23.666
I can't do it to my parents.

01:15:25.458 --> 01:15:27.125
It would just crush them.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:30.625
You know that's the only way
we are gonna be together.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.583
You know that.

01:16:16.791 --> 01:16:18.041
Listen here motherfucker.

01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:20.083
You fucking stay away from my sister.
Is that understood?

01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:22.041
-Who the fuck are you?
-This is the only warning

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:23.458
you're gonna fucking get.

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.583
Wanna talk? We can talk like men.

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:27.833
Show some respect.

01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:38.958
Now!

01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:41.166
You wanna talk to me? We can talk.

01:16:42.958 --> 01:16:44.000
Get the fuck off my car.

01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:46.625
Get off the fucking car.

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:01.583
Fuck. That didn't go as planned.

01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:03.041
You think so?

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.083
What's going on?

01:17:28.541 --> 01:17:30.291
I've been calling and messaging.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.375
You pulled a gun out on my brothers?

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:39.125
They threatened me.

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:41.250
What are you doing carrying a gun?

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:42.750
You know why I'm carrying a gun.

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:46.375
Talk to me.

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.541
I don't wanna be with a gangsta

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:50.166
who carries guns.

01:17:52.041 --> 01:17:53.583
I'm a fucking gangsta?

01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:55.125
I don't want this.

01:17:55.875 --> 01:17:57.583
You don't know what the fuck you want.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.250
You sit in your office all day,
helping people.

01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:02.583
You can't even help yourself.

01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:05.583
You can't stand up to your parents
and tell them what you really want.

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:09.083
This is your way out.

01:18:09.833 --> 01:18:11.291
I don't know who you are.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.833
You know exactly who I am.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:15.958
Thought I did.

01:18:17.791 --> 01:18:20.666
Yeah, you run to mommy and daddy.
Go on.

01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:44.833
Trouble with the Missus, huh?

01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:49.916
Time's up, Johnny boy.

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:55.458
Motherfucker.

01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:09.041
John!

01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:10.916
-Who is it?
-It's Mark.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:12.291
-Who?
-Mark.

01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:14.333
-You alone?
-Yeah, man.

01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:18.250
-What do you want?
-They're gonna burn down the gym.

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:19.708
-Who?
-My brother.

01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:21.291
-When?
-Fucking now.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.958
What happened to your face?

01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:29.333
What do you think?

01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:41.083
How many of them?

01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:43.541
-All of them.
-Come on, Wes.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.500
Shit.

01:22:50.041 --> 01:22:50.916
Come on.

01:22:51.916 --> 01:22:53.125
Fuck. Police.

01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:56.166
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.333
Do you know we're the only country
that eats its national emblem?

01:23:02.916 --> 01:23:03.875
Isn't that funny?

01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.166
We just love shooting fucking skippy's.

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:09.125
All right there? Hey!

01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:12.041
-You wanna sniff?
-You kids love a fucking sniff, don't ya?

01:23:12.166 --> 01:23:13.291
Burn the gym down.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.791
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.958
Come on.

01:23:19.458 --> 01:23:20.666
Come on.

01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:23.791
Burn the fucking thing down.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.416
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.

01:23:26.666 --> 01:23:27.750
Wes get the gun.

01:23:29.375 --> 01:23:31.250
You two, hey. Hey.

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:33.166
Fuck over here now.

01:23:33.333 --> 01:23:34.375
Move.

01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:39.583
We're gonna change this country.

01:23:39.708 --> 01:23:42.416
We are just beginning.
We're just getting started.

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:44.208
Our movement...

01:23:50.541 --> 01:23:52.583
You took the side of this terrorist
over me?

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.208
Betrayed by my own blood.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:23:59.708
You hear that?

01:24:00.625 --> 01:24:02.000
The sirens are coming for you.

01:24:02.166 --> 01:24:04.166
He's not so fucking tough
without a gun.

01:24:08.041 --> 01:24:09.083
Mark.

01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:10.625
Take this.

01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:12.166
And get out of here.

01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:14.416
Mark?

01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:18.750
Mark?

01:24:19.666 --> 01:24:20.541
Mark?

01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:24.083
Mark! Fucking dead! Fuck you!

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.208
Fight like a fucking man, you immigrant.

01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:29.500
-You Aboriginal?
-We made those cunts fucking civil.

01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:31.333
I hate you.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.083
You come into this country

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.916
and you take our fucking land.

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:39.083
No more building fucking mosques.

01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:42.583
I'm a Christian.

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:54.041
Stop! Fuck!

01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:55.958
You took my fucking brother.

01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:59.416
He's all I fucking got.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.500
He's all I fucking got.

01:25:05.625 --> 01:25:07.458
Get down, get down, get down.
Hand your head.

01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:09.625
Everybody down. Everybody down.

01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:12.958
Get down. Who's the owner of this gym?

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:14.958
-Me, me.
-All right. What's going on?

01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:18.166
The gun here,
was used in a shooting last week.

01:25:18.291 --> 01:25:20.916
-Owned by this man here.
-Shut the fuck up.

01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:14.500
Thank you.

01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:17.291
Sorry to show up like this unannounced.

01:26:18.083 --> 01:26:19.166
That's okay.

01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:23.125
I just wanted to come and introduce myself
out of respect for you and your family.

01:26:23.708 --> 01:26:26.166
And also let you know
that I've been dating your daughter.

01:26:33.333 --> 01:26:34.500
Thank you.

01:26:35.416 --> 01:26:36.833
You're a good man.

01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:39.791
You are not Muslim
and this is the problem.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.500
I make your daughter happy.
She makes me happy.

01:26:44.208 --> 01:26:45.750
Isn't that what you want for her?

01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:48.500
I love her.

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.041
Muslims marry Muslims,
Christians marry Christians.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:54.291
It's not something new.
You should know this.

01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:55.375
Too many problems.

01:26:55.958 --> 01:26:57.166
I'm sorry, I don't agree.

01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.500
People marry out of their religion
all the time.

01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:02.250
When a partner converts.
Are you willing to revert?

01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:05.083
-We can make it work.
-And what about the kids huh?

01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:07.166
Will they be Christian or Muslim?

01:27:07.666 --> 01:27:08.541
Either way.

01:27:09.541 --> 01:27:10.666
Would you love them any different?

01:27:10.916 --> 01:27:13.000
They'll still be your grandkids
no matter what.

01:27:13.458 --> 01:27:14.375
Your blood.

01:27:15.916 --> 01:27:18.833
I'm sorry. I cannot agree to this. Sorry.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.666
Thank you for coming.

01:27:25.291 --> 01:27:26.958
It was nice meeting you. Thank you.

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.666
You gonna answer my calls?

01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:38.083
I will.

01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:13.666
Amira!

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:17.458
Amira!

01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:27.125
How's your brother?

01:28:29.583 --> 01:28:30.583
Not good.

01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:33.666
And you?

01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:35.291
How you doing?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I'm okay.

01:28:42.041 --> 01:28:43.041
I miss him.

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:47.958
I know he's a dickhead,
but his still my brother.

01:28:48.916 --> 01:28:50.250
Yeah, that he is.

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:57.000
<i>Habibi.</i>

01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:10.666
Papa, I know what you're doing.

01:29:14.291 --> 01:29:15.750
You're checking up on me.

01:29:18.208 --> 01:29:20.791
My lease expires next month
and I'm not renewing it.

01:29:20.875 --> 01:29:22.291
I need to get away from all this.

01:29:33.041 --> 01:29:35.916
You want me to be happy?
I can't even tell you when I'm happy.

01:29:36.125 --> 01:29:37.291
I can't share...

01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.125
the best times of my life with you.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.125
Amira.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.125
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-Amira.

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:45.583
Hello beautiful.

01:29:53.375 --> 01:29:55.208
Who are you? What do you want?

01:29:55.416 --> 01:29:56.458
What?

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:59.166
Can't understand
a fucking word you're saying.

01:29:59.416 --> 01:30:00.750
Sit the fuck down.

01:30:01.916 --> 01:30:02.875
You too.

01:30:06.708 --> 01:30:07.958
Call your boyfriend.

01:30:08.875 --> 01:30:10.166
We broke off.

01:30:11.083 --> 01:30:12.083
Really?

01:30:12.208 --> 01:30:14.416
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

01:30:14.875 --> 01:30:16.208
Now fucking call him,

01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:19.208
or I'll put a bullet
in this bad accent motherfucker.

01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:21.083
Who you call motherfucker?

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.000
You bitch slut.

01:30:23.416 --> 01:30:24.416
Huh?

01:30:29.375 --> 01:30:30.916
A fucking bitch slut?

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.000
Well, I guess I am a bitch slut.

01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:38.083
Now make the fucking call.

01:30:38.333 --> 01:30:41.083
Come on, Mark.
He's only a two-time Olympian, mate.

01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:44.541
-You come and have a go, mate.
-Loving the head gear. Loving it.

01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:52.083
Hey, princess, remember me?

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:55.625
Where's Amira?

01:30:55.708 --> 01:30:58.958
Ah, she's beside me and unharmed for now.

01:30:59.125 --> 01:31:00.166
Put her on the phone.

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:04.583
<i>-John.
</i>-You okay?

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:06.291
Yeah, I'm here with Dad.

01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:08.583
Nas, your beef is with me.

01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:11.666
You got one hour
to get to her office with Mo.

01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:13.416
Not a fucking second more.

01:31:13.583 --> 01:31:14.833
Don't you fucking harm them.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.625
Well, John, that will depend on you.

01:31:18.208 --> 01:31:19.958
No police or I swear...

01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:22.125
I'll fucking kill them.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.041
<i>Tick tock! Time starts now.</i>

01:31:24.166 --> 01:31:25.375
Nas. Nas.

01:31:26.291 --> 01:31:27.375
Think he's angry.

01:31:42.916 --> 01:31:43.916
You carrying?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.583
Where the fuck's Mo?

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.791
I'll take you to him.

01:31:51.791 --> 01:31:53.833
-But you let them go.
-Fuck! Oh, Jesus.

01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:57.458
Fucking, I told you to fucking bring Mo.

01:31:57.666 --> 01:31:59.666
I told you to fucking bring him.

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:04.041
Fuck, now I gotta fucking kill someone.

01:32:04.125 --> 01:32:06.083
Yeah, which one first, aye?

01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:08.625
Eeeny, meeny, miny, moe.

01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:10.208
Catch an Arab by the toe.

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:11.541
I'll give you Mo, okay?

01:32:12.166 --> 01:32:13.166
Yeah?

01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:15.041
What if you're fucking lying to me?

01:32:15.166 --> 01:32:16.458
I'll give you Mo, please.

01:32:19.625 --> 01:32:20.666
Please.

01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:22.583
Okay.

01:32:23.083 --> 01:32:25.708
Now, I swear, if you fuck with me

01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:28.041
I will pay your little bitch a visit

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:31.666
and I'll slit her fucking throat
while her father watches. Yeah?

01:32:32.458 --> 01:32:33.583
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:37.083
Good.

01:32:39.333 --> 01:32:40.500
You keep her safe.

01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:42.333
No police.

01:32:44.583 --> 01:32:46.000
You fuck.

01:32:46.416 --> 01:32:47.916
Bring me my fucking jacket.

01:32:49.708 --> 01:32:51.375
The answer to your question...

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:53.791
yes.

01:32:57.166 --> 01:32:58.208
Move, cunt.

01:33:20.666 --> 01:33:23.125
Right. About fucking time, too.

01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:28.208
You two go with him.

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.291
If he tries anything,
fucking shoot him.

01:33:36.916 --> 01:33:37.833
Mo.

01:33:43.708 --> 01:33:44.750
Mo, it's John.

01:33:44.875 --> 01:33:46.583
Oi. Oi.

01:33:47.125 --> 01:33:48.375
Where the fuck is he?

01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:49.750
Where the fuck is he?

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.291
-Are you fucking with us?
-Don't fuck with me.

01:33:52.458 --> 01:33:53.500
Fuck.

01:34:00.083 --> 01:34:01.000
Here's your toy.

01:34:19.166 --> 01:34:20.125
Leave Mark, go.

01:34:21.083 --> 01:34:22.958
-I'm staying, John.
-Go.

01:34:23.125 --> 01:34:24.791
This is not your world. Go now.

01:34:27.666 --> 01:34:29.041
Now this is how it's gonna go down.

01:34:30.625 --> 01:34:32.125
Mo is gonna walk in front of ya's,

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:34.000
and I'm gonna walk behind ya's.

01:34:34.875 --> 01:34:36.666
One wrong fucking move
and I swear to God,

01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:38.375
on the fucking spot,
I'll cap ya's both.

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:39.666
Let's fucking go.

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.208
Come on, princess, let's go.

01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:45.333
-You fucking idiot.
-Calm down, puppy.

01:35:05.041 --> 01:35:06.000
That'll do.

01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:09.583
You thieving little grub.

01:35:10.375 --> 01:35:11.833
After all I did for you.

01:35:12.458 --> 01:35:13.583
This is how you repay me?

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:14.958
By stealing from me?

01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:17.458
What the fuck?
Someone shoot him. Shoot him.

01:35:28.666 --> 01:35:30.666
Ain't so fucking talkative now, are ya?

01:35:31.083 --> 01:35:32.083
Fuck.

01:35:33.041 --> 01:35:35.458
Put a bullet in him
and I'll make you my partner.

01:35:35.583 --> 01:35:37.208
Just like you did my parents?

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:39.416
Bulldog did that, not me.

01:35:40.208 --> 01:35:41.500
You fucking dog.

01:35:42.041 --> 01:35:43.208
Fuck!

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:56.291
You're on your own.

01:35:57.208 --> 01:35:58.791
-Good luck.
-I didn't do it.

01:35:58.916 --> 01:36:01.916
I had nothing to do with it, man.
Bulldog fucking did that.

01:36:06.083 --> 01:36:07.083
Oi!

01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:41.250
I told ya I'd do it.
