WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.413
(Traci) You know, maybe we could
get him forjaywalking.

00:04.463 --> 00:06.328
I mean, hejust--
he ran right through traffic.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.838
Too obvious.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.920
Loitering? Those little shorts--

00:10.969 --> 00:13.130
He's probably not got any ID on him.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.388
Oh, now see, there you go.
That's--That's public indecency.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.264
That's a criminal code violation.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.266
We're gonna have to search him.

00:20.312 --> 00:24.225
("The High Road"
by Broken Bells playing)

00:24.274 --> 00:26.230
- (laughing)
- Well...

00:26.276 --> 00:28.232
I gotta tell you, Nash,

00:28.278 --> 00:30.735
when it comes to men,
putting on this uniform

00:30.781 --> 00:33.113
is like putting on an invisibility cloak.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.820
(gunfire, tires skidding)

00:38.330 --> 00:40.446
J‘ Come on
and get the minimum J‘

00:40.499 --> 00:42.239
(brakes screech)

00:42.292 --> 00:43.623
(woman) Help me!
Help me, please! Stop him!

00:44.670 --> 00:47.377
1525. 1525. Sounds of gunshot,
possible injured party.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.083
Black SUV headed west on Scadding.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.463
Start an ambulance!

00:50.509 --> 00:53.046
J‘ Come on and get your overdose J‘

00:53.095 --> 00:55.632
J‘ Collect it at the borderline J‘

00:55.681 --> 00:57.842
(tires skid)

00:57.891 --> 01:00.507
My baby's in the back!
They've got my baby!

01:01.853 --> 01:03.980
(Traci) Police! Don't move!
Drop your gun!

01:04.022 --> 01:06.764
(Noelle) Nash, don't shoot!
There's a baby in the vehicle!

01:06.817 --> 01:08.523
There is a baby in the vehicle!

01:08.569 --> 01:11.811
Police! Don't move!
On your knees! On your knees!

01:12.489 --> 01:14.400
J‘ A detour J‘

01:14.449 --> 01:17.191
J‘ In your new life .l‘
(handcuffs clicking)

01:18.370 --> 01:19.985
J‘ Te|| all of your friends good-bye J‘

01:20.038 --> 01:21.994
Oh, my God!

01:22.040 --> 01:25.248
Is she okay? Thank you.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.285
Okay. She's scared.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.999
J‘ A detour in your new life J‘

01:30.048 --> 01:35.509
J‘ Te|| all of your friends good-bye J‘

01:35.554 --> 01:39.217
Yesterday,
Officer Williams, Officer Nash

01:39.266 --> 01:42.178
apprehended this man,
Jayson Kraker--

01:42.227 --> 01:44.684
carjacker who almost got away
with that baby yesterday.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.972
Good job.
(officers cheering)

01:53.405 --> 01:54.520
(Frank) Okay, now Kraker--

01:54.573 --> 01:56.188
he's also our prime suspect

01:56.241 --> 01:59.199
in last week's murder of the tourists
in that parking garage.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.450
Homicide's working on that.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.360
Now we got Kraker's gun.
The only problem is

02:02.414 --> 02:04.746
we can't find the bullet
to link him to the murder.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.952
And Kraker's accomplice is still at large,

02:07.002 --> 02:09.664
most likely armed, definitely dangerous.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.703
You know the drill.

02:11.757 --> 02:15.045
That's it. You have your assignments.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.213
Congratulations, Officer Nash.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.298
Yeah, it's too bad
the other guy got away.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.302
Why are we all being held back
to our regular assignments?

02:23.352 --> 02:25.183
I mean, we should be out there
looking for that other carjacker

02:25.228 --> 02:26.217
if he's so dangerous, right?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.511
You mean, like the time | busted up

02:27.564 --> 02:29.725
that international gun smuggling operation?

02:29.775 --> 02:31.731
- Follow my lead.
- (Chris laughs)

02:31.777 --> 02:34.018
(chuckles) Will do, Officer Epstein.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.941
(Gail) Will do.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.979
(Sam) Come on, man.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.148
I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.190
All right.
Gimme--Gimme that. Gimme.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.785
Ah, Detective Barber.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.913
Wow, look at that face, that baby face.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.949
I finally feel like I'm seeing the real you.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.459
Okay, shut up,
and I'm never playing poker

02:51.505 --> 02:53.461
- with you clowns again.
- Aw.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.747
Just bring more money next time.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.415
You won't have to bet your facial hair.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.756
Whoa, you look great.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.012
Really?

03:02.057 --> 03:04.093
Come on, choirboy. Time to roll.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.599
All right. You ready to catalogue
some evidence?

03:06.645 --> 03:08.977
Yeah. I guess searching
stolen cars is my reward

03:09.022 --> 03:10.228
for being such a hero.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.104
Wanna trade?

03:12.317 --> 03:13.306
No.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.310
No talking. You're driving.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.108
(whispers) Save me.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.607
Hey, Sammy.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.821
Yeah?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.781
- Win big last night?
- Yeah.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.162
- Feeling generous?
- No.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.500
How about you give me McNally for the day?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.788
What, are you detailing my, uh, rookie
to Homicide?

03:32.838 --> 03:35.295
Bosses want more bodies
on the carjackers.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.171
Mayor's coming down hard,
too many headlines.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.798
Bad for tourism.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.800
Serve, protect,
keep the mayor happy.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.507
At least you got Kraker in custody.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.638
Yeah, now all l have to do
is prove he did it.

03:44.683 --> 03:45.798
What do you say?

03:45.851 --> 03:48.809
- Yeah, fine. She's all yours.
- Really, seriously?

03:48.854 --> 03:52.392
Yeah. Have fun. Ow.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.892
Last poker game,
Jerry took Sam for over $400.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.981
It looks like revenge was sweet.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.191
- Do you play with them?
- No, that table's too easy.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.697
Plus, I'm a great bluffer.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.860
Wait. Did you really need
an extra body on this case?

04:06.538 --> 04:07.527
Yeah.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.287
Okay, you're notjust choosing me
because”.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.663
- No.
- you know.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.999
- Swear.
- That's a sign of bluffing.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.953
(laughs) I'm just checking.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.875
(Chris) 1507. Prep check.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.543
(woman on radio)
Copy, 1507. You test too.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.095
The other carjacker's
still on the loose.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.006
Maybe we should drive by
some parking garages.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.801
Wow. Mr. Rule Book
wants to take the initiative.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.970
No.
(seat belt clattering)

04:33.023 --> 04:35.014
We're two rookies riding together.
We gotta lay low.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.727
(man on radio)
This is 1505, prep check.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.984
Okay, why don't we just
leave that thing off, Chris?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.735
It's illegal to ride without your seat belt.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.523
Ooh. Well, real cops
don't wear seat belts.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.860
Oh, what?
So you're a real cop, and I'm not?

04:44.910 --> 04:47.492
You said it, not me.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.526
(man on radio) This is 1511...

04:48.580 --> 04:49.569
Let me ask you something, Gail.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.284
Anything.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.328
Why are you so mean?

04:57.422 --> 05:00.084
(laughing)

05:02.219 --> 05:03.675
Oh, my God.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.221
(woman on radio) Can I get a traffic car
to Banner and Spring

05:05.263 --> 05:06.719
for a single-car collision?

05:07.933 --> 05:10.766
1507 responding, on our way.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.102
(hangs up radio receiver)
(siren wails)

05:17.609 --> 05:19.270
Two pizza crusts.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.985
Hey, do you think Gail likes me?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.146
(coughs)
I don't think she likes anyone.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.905
Are you sure?
'Cause she laughs at myjokes.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.159
She's laughing at you,
as in not with you.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.910
One vodka bottle, empty.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.696
I don't know.
I think she has a little crush.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.910
Oh, come on. Ew.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.700
Relax. I'm not saying
I'm gonna hook up with her.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.540
I'm just saying,
you got to admit she's kind of sexy.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.204
No, I don't.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.123
(police radio chatter)

05:43.176 --> 05:44.632
Augh!

05:44.678 --> 05:47.135
One pair of undies.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.886
Boy shorts, actually.

05:48.932 --> 05:52.390
Ugh! Can you please explain to me

05:52.435 --> 05:56.428
how bagging panties
is related to carjacking?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.767
(groans) l have no idea.
Ask Noelle.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.432
Uh, you ask her.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.474
She scares me.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.563
Oh, tell me about it.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.775
Oh, look at that.
Box of condoms.

06:05.824 --> 06:06.939
(siren wailing)

06:06.992 --> 06:08.948
Nice. I'm starting to get a whole picture

06:08.994 --> 06:11.451
of a romantic evening
that played out in this car.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.953
In your world, this is romantic.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.617
Come to think of it, you and Gail
are perfect for each other.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.455
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.127
(Chris) 1507 on the scene.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.129
(woman on radio)
EMS is en route.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.631
Sir, an ambulance is on its way.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.258
It might be better if you just sat tight.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.670
I tried to brake. |--|--| did.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.385
The car seemed to have
a-a mind of its own.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.016
I can get a statement from you
once the paramedics check you out, okay?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.260
It was an accident.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.354
I've never had one,
not--not in 50 years.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.808
ls--ls he okay?

06:43.737 --> 06:44.817
(Chris) Is the lady hurt?

06:44.863 --> 06:47.229
No, she wasn't involved.
She came around the corner.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.897
She saw this. She called 911.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.491
Uh, no, no. Sir, sir, you should wait
for the ambulance.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.321
- No. Is he dead?
- Who?

06:56.374 --> 06:57.409
D-Did--Did you check?

06:57.459 --> 06:58.869
Chris!

07:07.052 --> 07:08.258
Okay.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.381
Keep an eye on the driver.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.639
(Chris) 1507. We got an injured cyclist here.
Where's the ambulance?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.675
Sir, can you hear me?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.346
I don't understand.
We have his gun.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.606
But we can't tie it to the murder,
and Kraker knows this.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.517
The bullet went through
the victim's neck,

07:25.570 --> 07:26.776
severed the jugular and exited.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.197
But there was no bullet
found at the scene,

07:28.239 --> 07:30.275
- so where'd the bullet go?
- Car.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.486
Car went to impound.
They tore it apart into tiny, little pieces.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.361
Well, I know how much you like surprises.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.494
I hate surprises.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.327
I got a tip from one of the nurses
in Emergency.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.366
About?

07:41.419 --> 07:42.750
I'll let you know if I'm right.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.124
Ooh, you're not one of those guys

07:45.173 --> 07:47.038
that has to be right all the time,
are you?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.632
I don't mind pretending
you're right sometimes.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.593
We're gonna say hello
to one Benjamin Kelly.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.381
21. Short sheet--shoplifting,
theft under a thousand.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.934
- Suspect?
- Not yet.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.968
- We just need to talk to him.
- Okay.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.646
(door beeps)

08:01.272 --> 08:03.479
Hey. Hey, hey.
You--You got the wrong guy.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.560
What are you arresting me for?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.395
- Nobody's arresting you.
- I didn't do nothing.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.651
We heard a rumor you suffered
a serious injury last week.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.608
Hey, have a seat.
Have a seat. Sit down.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.740
Just want to ask you a few questions

08:13.785 --> 08:16.242
on how you got that 9-millimeter bullet
in your head.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.278
(sighs)

08:20.667 --> 08:23.625
(police radio chatter,
sea gull squawking)

08:24.462 --> 08:26.077
(Chris) Uh, is there anyone
you'd like us to call?

08:26.131 --> 08:29.294
Huh? No. Uh, no.
I, uh, I live alone.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.169
Um, any family?
A-Anyone you work with?

08:33.221 --> 08:36.008
Work with? At my age?

08:36.057 --> 08:37.672
I'm actually flattered.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.842
Well, the EMS will finish
checking you out.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.136
You're a very nice young man,
very courteous.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.145
You're a--You're a good boy.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.647
(Jerry) Diaz.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.308
Yeah. Excuse me.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.317
Oh, of course.
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.352
He tell you what happened?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.317
Uh, cyclist swerved in front of him,
car had a mind of its own.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.281
You know... (scoffs)

08:55.326 --> 08:58.284
should be mandatory retesting
for every driver over 50.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.913
(Chris) I think he's in shock.
Poor old guy.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.290
Goes out for a drive,
ends up killing someone. It's awful.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.747
Yeah? A little bit worse
for the cyclist, wouldn't you say?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.920
Okay, I'm gonna wait for the coroner.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.252
You and Gail make sure the old guy's car
gets to impound.

09:12.844 --> 09:13.833
All right?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.219
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Okay.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.222
Man, what the hell
have you been smokin'?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.633
How could I be walking around
with a bullet in my head?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.142
Where are we taking him?

09:23.188 --> 09:24.553
We're not taking him anywhere.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.641
We're taking evidence.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.021
He just happens to be
along for the ride.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.183
Hey, he can hear you, jackbrain.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.817
Yo, give me my phone back, man.
I want to call my lawyer.

09:31.863 --> 09:32.852
I know my rights.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.362
You haven't been arrested.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.320
Well, then this constitutes...
unlawful... containment!

09:38.369 --> 09:39.745
Unlawful confinement.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.907
Which is not applicable here.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.823
Uh, this is more, uh,
investigative detention.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.920
We are taking him
to the hospital, right?

09:47.962 --> 09:50.123
Oh, yeah. And we're gonna get
an X-ray of that bullet.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.879
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no. Hey, hey.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.415
I don't do hospitals, okay?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.254
Look, they're gonna give me
a needle or something.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.009
I don't want anything to do with that.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.545
You should've thought of that
before you got hooked up

09:58.598 --> 10:00.384
with a bunch of carjackers,
jackbrain.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.136
(Benny) I don't like X-rays.
They freak me out.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.396
(Andy) Okay, well, then try
to get your mind off of it.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.729
Maybe tell me what happened
when the guy got shot at the parking garage.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.360
I don't remember any parking garage.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.111
I got a bullet in my head, remember?

10:17.742 --> 10:20.734
You know, you dress pretty nice
for a guy who doesn't have a job.

10:21.913 --> 10:25.030
Who says I don't have a job?
| freelance.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.870
(laughs) Is that so?

10:27.919 --> 10:29.375
(chuckles) Yeah.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.378
I mean, look, a regularjob
just doesn't pay enough.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.379
I got a lot of expenses.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.883
I'm serious!
Look, I got a sick mama.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.636
(laughs) A sick mama.
Wow, original.

10:40.682 --> 10:44.174
Wow. You have a hard time
trusting people, don't you?

10:45.019 --> 10:46.008
No.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.056
You know...

10:48.898 --> 10:50.354
you look really trustworthy,

10:50.400 --> 10:52.482
so l'm-a tell you the truth.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.315
I got a lot of people relying on me.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.020
Oh, yeah?

10:59.033 --> 11:01.240
Yeah! A lot of people.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.078
Look, I'm like their personal ATM, okay?

11:05.123 --> 11:07.034
- (laughs) Shut up.
- Don't laugh. It ain't funny. I'm serious.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.371
Officer, look. It's not easy
trying to be the hero.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.580
- Oh.
- It really isn't.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.620
(Luke) They're ready for us.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.295
Don't look so scared, Benny.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.131
Officer McNally will hold your hand.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.597
The object measures
just under a centimeter.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.803
Right, width of a 9-millimeter bullet.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.060
It entered here,
partially penetrated the skull,

11:29.105 --> 11:31.061
embedded itself in the frontal lobe.
It's--

11:31.107 --> 11:32.972
Oh, hold on.
It's in my brain?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.358
(sighs) If you're going
to get shot in the head,

11:35.403 --> 11:36.768
the frontal lobe's the best spot.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.279
And, uh, it also was slowed down by--

11:40.325 --> 11:42.441
I understand it passed through another victim?

11:42.493 --> 11:44.074
- Exactly.
- No way.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.032
I wasn't there, all right.
I live in a rough neighborhood.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.332
It was a stray bullet.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.625
Are you in any pain?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.999
A lot of pain.
I think I need painkillers.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.034
(scoffs)

11:53.087 --> 11:55.544
Look, um... can...

11:55.590 --> 11:56.670
can you remove it?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.957
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.
You asked for an X-ray.

11:59.010 --> 11:59.999
- Listen, just--
- Yeah.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.671
The fact is that people can survive years
with shrapnel lodged in their bodies.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.714
So |'||--|'|| be okay.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.473
I can live with it, right?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.474
My concern here is the bullet.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.647
I need this to put a murderer in jail.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.101
And I need the patient's consent
in order to proceed.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.230
Yeah. And I don't give it.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.517
Fine. I'll get a search warrant.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.315
McNally.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.568
You stay here.
Keep an eye on our man Benny.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.031
I'm gonna talk to the prosecutor.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.867
There's a surgeon on shift
who's willing to operate.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.999
Okay, but we're sure that,
you know, he's involved?

12:33.044 --> 12:34.329
Like, he's notjust a witness?

12:34.379 --> 12:35.960
There's a bullet inside
his head that killed a man

12:36.005 --> 12:37.745
that we all know
came from Kraker's gun.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.505
I need that bullet.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.006
Okay, what do I do
if he tries to leave?

12:41.052 --> 12:44.340
(sighs) Keep him talking.
Gain his trust.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.505
If anyone can do it, it's you.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.138
Who knows? Maybe you can
convince him to do it.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.389
I'll check on you later.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.022
Those pills should knock him out
for a couple hours.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.060
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.405
(sighs) You doing okay?

13:05.451 --> 13:08.238
Oh... (sighs)
I don't like hospitals.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.362
I think I like sedatives, though.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.458
Benny, can we please
talk about last week?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.210
Last week?

13:18.256 --> 13:19.462
The parking garage.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.168
I know you saw Kraker shoot that man.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.175
You know, itjust would--
it would really help me out

13:24.220 --> 13:26.051
if you could tell me
exactly what happened.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.634
(snoring)

13:33.271 --> 13:34.681
Or not.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.022
(sighs)

13:38.067 --> 13:40.023
Gail, your seat belt.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.106
Crap.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.067
Wait. What are you doing?

13:45.116 --> 13:47.778
I got blood on my shirt.

13:48.911 --> 13:49.900
(police radio chatter)

13:49.954 --> 13:52.286
- Can you stop staring?
- I'm not staring.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.123
So what did the old geezer
have to say for himself?

13:58.212 --> 14:00.168
He's, like, a retired schoolteacher.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.294
He's--He's, like, 80.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.957
He shouldn't have been on the road.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.592
You know the guy that he killed?
He has, like, kids.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.888
Poor guy was on the way to work.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.512
You know, the driver was probably on, like,
a senior's cocktail. I've seen that before.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.973
Senior's cocktail?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.978
Yeah, my grandmother was on it.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.312
She was on, like, ten different
kinds of medication,

14:21.361 --> 14:24.273
and she just acted like
a crazy bat out of hell

14:24.322 --> 14:25.437
at the slightest provocation.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.980
He didn't seem crazy.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.446
ln shock, maybe.
But he called me a good boy.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.453
- That's really creepy.
- Right?

14:33.498 --> 14:35.159
Probably high as a kite.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.119
You know, I probably should've
asked him about that--

14:37.168 --> 14:39.409
like, if he was on any type
of medication or anything.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.043
Yeah, Chris, you probably
should've asked him that.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.504
You gonna put your belt on?

14:47.011 --> 14:49.172
Putting my seat belt on, okay?
I'm buckling up.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.758
(seat belt clicks)
You happy?

15:03.528 --> 15:05.018
(sighs)

15:10.910 --> 15:12.025
Excuse me.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.993
Where's the guy in 402?

15:14.038 --> 15:16.529
He woke up, had to go to the can.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.497
Hey.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.354
(big band ringtone blaring)

15:42.400 --> 15:45.187
Sammy, you gotta change that ringer, man.
It's deadly.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.976
Yeah. (turns off ringtone)

15:47.947 --> 15:48.936
What?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.230
(Andy) I need your help.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.194
I thought you were with Callaghan.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.950
Yeah, well, he left me in charge
of guarding some evidence.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.611
Well, it's a witness, actually.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.404
It's a witness with some evidence.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.198
McNally, I already have a headache.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.207
Look, I lost the witness, okay?

16:02.253 --> 16:04.209
The doctor said he was
gonna be asleep for hours.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.541
The doctor said?
The doctor is not a cop.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.580
Where's Callaghan?

16:07.633 --> 16:10.625
Okay, listen, I gotta find this kid
before Luke finds out that I lost him.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.464
And I care because, uh...

16:12.513 --> 16:15.971
You care, because if Boyko finds out
that I screwed up this carjacking case,

16:16.017 --> 16:17.882
take a wild guess which training officer

16:17.935 --> 16:21.018
he's gonna drag into his office
and scream at for half an hour.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.143
All right, all right. All right.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.396
Calm down. What do you need?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.975
Okay, Luke brought in this kid,
Benjamin Kelly,

16:27.028 --> 16:28.643
and all of his personal effects
are in booking.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.277
See if you can find his cell phone.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.608
Jeez.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.115
Oh, and, um, Luke took the car,
so could you pick me up?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.741
Please?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.114
Ah.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.625
Yeah.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.626
(Noelle) This one just came in.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.664
It's an accident.
Contents need to be catalogued.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.332
Sure thing.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.087
Yes?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.516
Uh, we were just wondering,

16:57.558 --> 16:59.674
uh, if there was anything in particular
we were looking for,

16:59.727 --> 17:01.683
with regards to the carjackings.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.810
You know how some people say
that, uh, there's no stupid questions?

17:07.360 --> 17:08.475
They're wrong.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.947
Dov, this is just overflow
from the impound lot.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.153
Okay, we're painting a fence here.
We're rookies.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.159
This has nothing to do
with the carjackings.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.827
Uh, we've got some bills...

17:23.960 --> 17:25.291
paid.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.826
Um...

17:26.879 --> 17:28.460
Pen. Broken pen.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.830
Maps, folded.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.920
And a tin of, I don't know,
friggin' peppermint.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.928
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi. Join the fun.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.634
Yeah, we were actually
on the scene of this one.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.389
Oh, whoa.
Let me guess--uh, old guy.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.719
How'd you know?

17:41.769 --> 17:44.385
Nothing says golden years
like a tin of peppermints.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.471
(laughs)

17:48.025 --> 17:50.858
- Fatal?
- Uh, yes, for the cyclist that he hit.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.815
Yeah, we're looking for, uh,
any evidence of too many meds.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.651
If the driver was taking a lot of pills,
it might explain what happened.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.317
See, Chris is kind of worried about
the old guy. I think it's sweet.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.486
Well, knock yourselves out.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.325
Yeah, we'll take it from here.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.657
(pills rattle)

18:05.710 --> 18:08.497
- All right.
- Thanks.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.709
I'm telling you,
Gail totally wants to get with me.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.043
Now I'm not saying
I'm gonna ask her out, but--

18:14.093 --> 18:15.253
Please shut up.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.506
What's with you today?

18:19.140 --> 18:20.846
Who is she?

18:20.891 --> 18:23.974
Keisha Simmons. Number one
on Benny's speed dial.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.976
Oh, thanks for bringing her in.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.683
Yeah. Remember...

18:27.732 --> 18:29.939
she's under no obligation
to answer any questions,

18:29.984 --> 18:32.521
so... don't push your luck.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.107
Be nice. Ask the important
questions first. Got it?

18:35.156 --> 18:37.147
- Yeah, got it.
- (mouth full) all right.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.109
(door beeps)

18:42.622 --> 18:43.702
Hi.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.988
(door closes)

18:45.708 --> 18:46.914
What did Benny do now?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.871
ljust want to talk to him.
You a friend of his?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.956
Ex. Very ex.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.122
Never-want-to-see-
the-bastard-again ex.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.211
Hmm. 'Cause you're number one
on his speed dial.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.716
Yeah, and the last time he called,

18:57.762 --> 19:00.925
I told him I didn't want to talk to him--
not then, not ever.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.973
What do you want to talk to him about?

19:04.018 --> 19:05.883
He's helping us with an investigation.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.392
Helping the police?

19:09.065 --> 19:11.522
Doesn't sound like the Benny I know.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.730
The other cop said I was free to go
any time I wanna, and I wanna.

19:14.779 --> 19:17.191
Uh, okay, well, if you hear
from him, tell him to call me?

19:18.324 --> 19:19.564
Sure, but I'm not gonna
hear from him.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.198
Listen, does Benny
have a sick mother?

19:21.243 --> 19:22.278
Mm.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.496
His parents are dead.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.329
He used his mother's funeral excuse
on me twice.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.333
Okay, well, if you were trying to find him,
where would you look?

19:30.419 --> 19:31.955
I wouldn't look.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.792
(door buzzes, beeps)
Thanks.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.298
Hey, I was thinking that maybe
we should check out--

19:41.347 --> 19:43.087
Previous addresses?
I'm way ahead of you.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.471
Here's his latest.

19:45.476 --> 19:48.434
37 Seneca Drive--
Dabramo, initial's "M."

19:48.479 --> 19:50.435
- Any warrants?
- None in the system.

19:51.482 --> 19:52.471
Maybe it's a girlfriend.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.938
Yeah, maybe.
You know, if this guy was a witness

19:55.986 --> 19:57.021
to your carjacking murder,

19:57.071 --> 19:59.107
you'd better hope you find him
before Kraker's buddy does.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.780
Well, Benny didn't seem
too worried about that.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.067
Well, I should really go with you.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.111
No, no, no, listen.
I totally screwed this up.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.496
I need to fix it.
So just lend me the keys to your truck.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.827
I'm gonna go look at the address,

20:10.876 --> 20:13.208
and then you can blow the whistle on me
and ruin my entire career.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.994
I'm sorry.
You want to borrow my truck?

20:16.048 --> 20:18.209
Okay, we can just go talk to Boyko
right now. No problem.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.924
Brakes are touchy, all right?

20:24.974 --> 20:27.056
- Just careful.
- Okay.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.643
Hey, pal, I thought, uh,
Callaghan had your rookie today.

20:34.692 --> 20:35.807
Yeah, well, Callaghan's busy.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.895
Oh.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.685
What? I'm helping her out.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.854
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.397
Find anything?

20:43.451 --> 20:46.488
Mm, gramps needs to pay
his Auto Club bill.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.950
He's got perfect penmanship,
but there's no pill receipts.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.365
Is there, uh, any numbers?
Anyone we can call?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.870
Nope.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.293
There's gotta be someone.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.003
Maybe if we knew
where he was going...

20:58.048 --> 20:59.128
(GPS beeps)

21:01.677 --> 21:04.168
- Wait. That's weird.
- What?

21:04.221 --> 21:08.965
Well, that's the cyclist's address
in The Beaches...

21:09.018 --> 21:12.681
and that's where we found him
dead on the side of the road.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.187
W-What?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.525
(Dov) Oh, this is--this is great.

21:20.571 --> 21:24.314
We're stuck here handling
the world's grossest evidence

21:24.366 --> 21:26.527
while everybody else
is out working actual cases.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.568
I know. It's disgusting.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.572
Absolutely nothing cool about this job.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.241
Whoa.

21:37.588 --> 21:38.577
Can I see that?

21:39.590 --> 21:40.579
What is it?

21:40.633 --> 21:44.171
Uh, it's a saber from "The Righteous War
of the Pontoon Pirates."

21:44.220 --> 21:45.300
Which is?

21:45.346 --> 21:48.554
Video game.
Man, | always wanted one of these.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.260
(exhales) Never got it.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.891
Now, okay, what is with you today?

21:55.940 --> 21:58.272
Leo's dad bought him a toy gun.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.557
So?

21:59.610 --> 22:01.942
I don't want Leo playing with guns.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.403
(chuckles, scoffs)

22:04.448 --> 22:07.030
What? Were your parents
letting you play with guns?

22:07.076 --> 22:10.489
No. My mom only bought us
educational toys from Sweden.

22:10.538 --> 22:13.951
We were on a strict diet of
peace, love and baby--Whoa!

22:15.960 --> 22:16.949
Blood.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.794
- No way.
- Yes way.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.205
That is so coffee.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.249
No, it's blood.
I'll bet you 20 bucks.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.383
(shakes hand)
We'll go ask Noelle.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.419
Not it.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.678
Oh, come on. She likes you.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.759
She's had it in for me since Day One.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.800
Okay, fine. I'll go ask her.
You, uh, bag it up.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.093
Okay, okay.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.272
All right. I'm going.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.989
- Hey.
- Oh.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.774
- It's not what it looks like.
- Sorry.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.160
They're hormones. Shut the door.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.542
(sighs)
(door creaks, closes)

22:58.794 --> 23:01.285
I'm really sorry.
I had no idea.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.795
lt's--lt's harder than it looks.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.790
I need the mirror to--

23:07.511 --> 23:08.842
to hit the right spot.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.964
(scoffs)

23:15.477 --> 23:17.217
This must look pretty desperate, huh?

23:18.856 --> 23:20.767
Fertility clinic, sperm donor...

23:22.902 --> 23:25.143
(sighs deeply)

23:25.195 --> 23:28.153
You know what I see
when I look at this thing?

23:30.034 --> 23:31.820
| see nine years...

23:33.787 --> 23:36.745
nine years with the same guy
who didn't want kids.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.454
Same guy who just had a baby
with his new girlfriend.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.454
Well, I don't know.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.833
| see someone who wants
something so much

23:49.929 --> 23:52.386
that she's willing to stick
a needle in her ass to get it.

23:55.601 --> 23:59.514
You know, it's not easy finding someone,
doing this job.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.269
I don't want to scare you, but it's true.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.854
Well, having a kid's
not gonna make it any easier.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.815
I don't want to scare you,
but that's true.

24:12.326 --> 24:13.907
Is this your first time?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.489
Yep.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.829
I gotta do 'em twice a day for two weeks,

24:19.875 --> 24:22.457
and it's, uh, kind of wigging me out.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.453
You know, like, stabbing yourself
with a needle--

24:25.506 --> 24:29.124
it's a little counterintuitive.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.542
(both laugh)

24:32.054 --> 24:33.339
You want me to do it?

24:46.777 --> 24:48.733
Thing is, uh,

24:50.239 --> 24:52.696
Boyko's gone in a few weeks,

24:52.741 --> 24:54.072
and I'm up for a promotion.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.608
SO if this--

24:57.204 --> 24:59.445
If this doesn't work out,
then I want those stripes.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.537
And if, uh, if anyone finds out,
I'll know it was you.

25:03.877 --> 25:04.866
- Ow!
- (chuckles)

25:07.297 --> 25:08.628
(laughs)

25:16.265 --> 25:17.596
I won't tell a soul.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.434
(cell phone rings)

25:31.113 --> 25:32.148
(ring)

25:32.364 --> 25:33.865
Uh... ooh...

25:34.408 --> 25:35.523
(ring--beep)

25:35.826 --> 25:38.363
Hey. What's happenin'?

25:38.412 --> 25:40.448
Sorry, I'm still trying
to track down this prosecutor,

25:40.497 --> 25:42.453
which is taking a lot longer
than I thought.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.241
Oh, oh, totally cool.
You know, you should take your time.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.161
How's our guy? Please tell me
you've talked him into giving up the bullet

25:48.213 --> 25:49.248
so I can get the hell out of here.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.662
Uh...

25:50.716 --> 25:52.001
Hang on.
I'm getting another call.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.292
It's the prosecutor.
I gotta go. I'll call you back.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.425
Okay. I...

26:00.517 --> 26:03.509
(siren wailing in distance)

26:11.195 --> 26:12.310
(knocks on door)

26:15.157 --> 26:16.192
Come on.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.454
(door creaks)

26:21.497 --> 26:22.657
Hello, Benjamin.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.082
(low voice)
How'd you find me?

26:24.124 --> 26:25.159
You're coming with me.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.324
I can't.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.832
- Okay, then I'll arrest you.
- What?

26:27.878 --> 26:28.913
Let's go!

26:28.962 --> 26:30.623
Okay, all right.
Just give me a minute.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.287
(woman) Benny,
who are you talkin' to?

26:32.341 --> 26:34.172
(normal voice) It's okay, Mama.
l-lt's for me.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.678
There better be a damn good
explanation for this.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.679
Officer, if he's giving you any trouble--

26:41.725 --> 26:44.683
Mama, this is Officer McNally,

26:44.728 --> 26:47.219
and I've been--
I've been helping her out.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.357
It's true.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.688
He's been helping me out.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.480
Well, then, come on inside.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.399
Don't just stand there!

27:00.452 --> 27:01.783
(laughs)

27:02.621 --> 27:03.861
Okay.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.709
Look at me.
Look at the state of this place.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.749
You gonna take
all day down there?

27:18.929 --> 27:19.918
Want a cup of coffee?

27:19.972 --> 27:23.180
Oh, no coffee, thank you.
Uh, we're actually in a hurry.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.181
You're Benny's mother?

27:25.227 --> 27:28.014
Foster mother. At least, I was.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.938
Too much of a smartass now
to listen to me anymore.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.557
Marie Dabramo.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.225
Andy.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.940
Doesn't stop you telling me what to do.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.942
I should have thrown him out years ago.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.734
(chuckles) Yeah. That why you
want me to visit you every day?

27:42.786 --> 27:44.242
Benny, you almost done down there?

27:44.288 --> 27:47.246
He's a good boy, most of the time.

27:47.291 --> 27:51.079
But I could've drowned
by the time you got here.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.040
I told you l was gonna be here,
and I am.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.421
Okay.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.422
That should hold for now.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.379
l'll fix it for real later, okay?

28:00.429 --> 28:02.340
- Later?
- Yeah.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.926
Look, you're not gonna leave me
with this mess.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.307
Mrs. Dabramo, I'm sorry.
Benny's assisting us

28:07.352 --> 28:09.729
with a really important investigation.
We've gotta go.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.513
Yeah. |--| mean I promise
I'll be back, okay?

28:12.566 --> 28:15.433
All right? Mwah. Thank you.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.067
You're not gonna assist anybody
dressed like that.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.319
No, we really don't have time.

28:19.364 --> 28:24.279
No, I've got a fresh shirt out here for you.
I know because I washed it.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.454
So where's the other guy--
Detective fancy pants?

28:29.499 --> 28:31.990
- He's meeting us.
- Why are you with him, anyway?

28:32.669 --> 28:35.126
l'm detailed to Homicide.
(tires skid)

28:38.467 --> 28:40.503
(tires skidding)

28:41.762 --> 28:45.050
Shots fired at 37 Seneca Drive.
I need backup.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.305
- (woman on radio) All units...
- Are you all right?

28:47.351 --> 28:49.216
Yeah, you saved my life.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.636
(woman on radio) All units respond.
Shots fired at 37 Seneca Drive.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.149
I'm sick and tired of you
lying to me, Benny.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.607
When are you gonna admit you were working
with these carjackers, huh?

29:00.781 --> 29:02.317
Um...

29:02.366 --> 29:05.073
Okay, okay.
I was at the parking garage.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.951
But I didn't know Kraker.
| only knew the other guy, Mike.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.534
He told me him and one of his boys
were gonna boost some stereos

29:11.583 --> 29:13.244
and that they would pay me to keep six.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.285
Lookout

29:16.713 --> 29:17.964
Is that really the truth?

29:18.006 --> 29:20.622
I needed money. All right?

29:20.676 --> 29:22.416
But then they--
theyjacked the guy's car,

29:22.469 --> 29:24.551
and I didn't know they had a gun, okay?

29:24.596 --> 29:26.302
I swear I didn't know they had a gun.

29:26.348 --> 29:29.260
The guy freaks, he runs right at me,
and Kraker shoots him.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.008
He falls right on top of me.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.847
| go down. I'm covered in blood,

29:32.896 --> 29:35.888
and I got this crazy, crazy headache.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.643
Then I realize...

29:38.652 --> 29:39.732
he's dead.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.859
And I got this.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.604
Who's Mike?

29:45.284 --> 29:46.364
Mike Simmons.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.660
Uh, I spoke to a Keisha Simmons.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.662
That's Mike's sister.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.618
You didn't tell Keisha
you were looking for me?

29:54.668 --> 29:56.579
Well, |--| said
you were helping us out.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.453
She must have called her brother.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.747
Gotta play closer to the vest, lady.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.008
The way you kept
your mouth shut with Marie, l...

30:05.470 --> 30:06.801
I owe you one.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.635
- McNally, how you doing?
- Good.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.846
Good? Man, she saved my ass.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.721
Yeah, she's got a lion's heart, this one.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.024
(woman)
Ma'am, you can't go there, okay?

30:18.066 --> 30:20.899
Got the guy who shot at you,
pulled him over on Elm Avenue.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.400
ls his name Mike Simmons?

30:22.446 --> 30:24.027
As a matter of fact, it is.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.403
We got the shooter in custody.

30:25.449 --> 30:26.689
That's what Sam just told me.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.607
Why are you even here?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.031
The thing is, l, um...

30:33.081 --> 30:35.242
Actually, it's my fault.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.248
Officer McNally brought me.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.912
I needed to pick up a few things
and--and see my mom...

30:40.964 --> 30:44.172
you know, if I was gonna do
the operation.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.680
You still need the bullet, right?

31:01.902 --> 31:03.767
Nice work, McNally.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.606
I'll take him to the hospital.
You finish up here.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.236
Well, we don't have to operate.
He was there.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.863
He saw the whole thing.
Can't he just testify?

31:08.909 --> 31:10.274
Come on. With his record?

31:10.327 --> 31:13.114
Yeah, but even the doctor said
surgery might not even be necessary.

31:13.163 --> 31:15.449
She also said she would operate
if Benny gave his consent.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.080
He's a kid.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.740
He's an uneducated kid who--

31:18.794 --> 31:21.376
--who's making the first decent
decision of his adult life.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.337
He's doing this because of me.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.964
I don't want him doing this
because of me.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.170
Andy, it is not yourjob to save people

31:28.220 --> 31:30.085
from what you think
they should and shouldn't do.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.753
It's yourjob to help close this case.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.469
- Okay?
- (sighs)

31:40.065 --> 31:41.851
(engine starts)

31:48.949 --> 31:51.941
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

31:57.040 --> 31:58.655
You're the officers from the accident.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.664
How are you feeling, Mr. Peterson?

32:00.710 --> 32:02.120
A bit shaky.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.835
I suppose l'll survive.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.749
The nurse will be by any minute
with the discharge papers.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.009
Mr. Peterson, l'm Officer Peck.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.797
You should know that we found
the map on your GPS system.

32:16.893 --> 32:20.852
You--You had no right to search
through my personal things.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.398
You knew Donald Cross.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.472
Who?

32:24.526 --> 32:26.187
The man you ran over this morning.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.646
The man you killed.

32:28.488 --> 32:29.477
This is ridiculous.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.442
I'm not gonna listen
to another word of this.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.947
We have evidence, Mr. Peterson.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.493
The GPS system in your car
shows the route that Donald took

32:36.538 --> 32:38.369
every morning when he cycled to work.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.621
You planned it.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.952
The guy was your student in the '80s.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.117
That's when you sexually assaulted him.

32:44.171 --> 32:47.629
You're a nice boy.
You wouldn't listen to these lies.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.711
His wife told us he was
gonna have you arrested,

32:50.760 --> 32:54.002
and she also told us that Donald
was contacting other students.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.262
You don't want to listen
to that vicious little bitch.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.050
Hey, you watch your language,
Mr. Peterson.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.967
You keep that bitch away from me.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.601
Just like Donny--
telling lies, out to get me.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.815
I want my lawyer.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.692
Fine. You can call your lawyer
from the station.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.229
But right now you're under arrest
for the murder of Donald Cross.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.943
Come on.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.992
You know, Benny, you could still--

33:18.038 --> 33:20.996
I know what you're gonna say.
I'm not doing this for you.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.952
Then why are you doing it?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.788
That man in the garage...

33:26.338 --> 33:27.919
he died in my arms.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.829
You think I want this in my head?

33:29.883 --> 33:31.965
Any of it?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.626
I'm getting it out. Maybe it'll help.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.635
I don't know. I don't know.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.718
Hey, being a badass
has not been working out so good.

33:39.768 --> 33:40.848
(chuckles) I mean, look at me.

33:40.894 --> 33:44.261
I got a freakin' bullet in my head.
Hello.

33:44.314 --> 33:48.227
I figure the odds gotta be better
playing one of the good guys.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.528
(exhales deeply) Wish me luck.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.526
(sighs)

33:53.448 --> 33:55.313
Okay. Good luck.

34:00.497 --> 34:01.987
I'll be waiting here when you wake up.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.541
(chuckles) I bet.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.543
Make sure I don't run away again, huh?

34:05.585 --> 34:07.667
(laughs) Damn straight.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.498
(chuckles)

34:14.344 --> 34:15.504
Peace!

34:24.020 --> 34:26.978
Chris, what is taking you so long?

34:27.023 --> 34:28.684
I'm ready.
(zips up bag)

34:28.733 --> 34:29.722
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.687
- We caught a murderer.
- We did. We caught a murderer.

34:34.698 --> 34:35.904
and wanted to look
for his prescription--

34:35.949 --> 34:37.280
If you hadn't thought he was creepy...

34:37.826 --> 34:38.815
Did you see the look on Jerry's face?

34:38.868 --> 34:40.369
Did you see Boyko's face?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.202
- We should celebrate or something.
- Yes.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.331
I mean, uh, do you want to get a drink?
Are--Are you free?

34:46.876 --> 34:48.741
Whoa. A drink?

34:49.254 --> 34:52.542
We just solved a homicide in one day
all by ourselves,

34:52.591 --> 34:53.922
and you're asking me for one drink?

34:53.967 --> 34:56.083
Or... or two?

34:56.136 --> 34:57.171
Two!

34:57.220 --> 34:59.336
Wow, I got you up to two drinks, Diaz.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.220
Do you have a curfew or something?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.255
'Cause we caught a murderer.

35:03.643 --> 35:04.849
We did.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.179
- We did.
- We caught a murderer.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.346
And you don't need a note
from your mom to go out.

35:10.900 --> 35:14.313
(Oceanship)
.l‘ Took a big trip J‘

35:14.362 --> 35:18.025
J‘ With your old band .l‘

35:18.074 --> 35:20.281
.l‘ To your homeland .l‘

35:20.327 --> 35:21.942
(Traci) Pay up.

35:21.995 --> 35:23.860
(sighs) I should have known.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.700
I should have known it wasn't blood.
It was just coffee.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.287
Another red-letter day
for Officer Epstein.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.372
Ha ha! Thank you.

35:31.421 --> 35:34.538
So what were you and Noelle
talking about for so long?

35:34.591 --> 35:38.004
I don't know. Family stuff, kids.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.339
You still worried about Leo?

35:40.388 --> 35:41.423
Thank you.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.429
Thanks. Yeah, you know, I am.

35:43.475 --> 35:47.138
He's not growing up with the same
advantages you had, Epstein,

35:47.187 --> 35:50.554
with your big ol' family,

35:50.607 --> 35:53.349
educational toys,
never playing with guns.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.517
Whoa. Who said
I never played with guns?

35:55.570 --> 35:59.529
I said I wasn't allowed
to play with guns.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.698
Why is it such a big deal?
Doesn't need to be such a big deal.

36:02.744 --> 36:06.362
It's just a little piece of plastic, you know?
It's just a little toy.

36:06.790 --> 36:10.703
But I look at my kid,
and he's got this gun out,

36:10.752 --> 36:13.494
and he's pretending
to shoot people dead.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.798
.l‘ When they aren't looking J‘

36:16.049 --> 36:19.007
It makes me feel like...

36:19.052 --> 36:22.510
Like a disreputable single mom
with violent tendencies?

36:22.555 --> 36:25.092
(chuckles) You're not.

36:25.141 --> 36:28.429
You're--You're a cop who carries a gun
to protect people,

36:28.478 --> 36:30.434
and you've got a little kid
who wants to be just like you.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.270
Well, if you say so.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.314
Wildest boy I ever had.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.894
Five foster homes before I got to him.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.818
It's a miracle he turned out
as well as he did.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.734
Hmm. I'm sure a lot of that
had to do with you.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.615
He's a good kid.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.834
Just needed someone
to see past his record,

36:52.836 --> 36:54.497
see who he really was.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.417
He's really lucky to have you.

37:02.512 --> 37:06.972
(no audible dialogue)

37:07.016 --> 37:10.759
.l‘ Take the pills
that they give you mornings J‘

37:10.812 --> 37:14.145
.l‘ Spit them out
when they aren't looking .l‘

37:14.190 --> 37:16.772
J‘ Fix a smile,
but you burn it hot .l‘

37:16.818 --> 37:20.481
.l‘ It's a mad, mad world .l‘

37:20.530 --> 37:23.738
J‘NanananaJ‘

37:23.783 --> 37:27.116
J‘NanananaJ‘

37:27.162 --> 37:30.905
J‘NanananaJ‘

37:30.957 --> 37:34.666
J‘NanananaJ‘

37:34.711 --> 37:38.295
J‘NanananaJ‘

37:38.339 --> 37:42.082
J‘NanananaJ‘

37:42.135 --> 37:45.719
J‘NanananaJ‘

37:45.764 --> 37:52.932
J‘NanananaJ‘

38:09.537 --> 38:10.868
I didn't know how to number it.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.200
You can take care of that.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.824
Hey, hey, hey. Wait. Stop.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.208
Wait.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.834
This isn't your fault.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.636
The surgeon, she would've never operated
if she thought this was gonna happen.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.930
I know. She said it would be risky.
It's nobody's fault.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.423
- It's just a fluke.
- It was.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.426
This bullet is gonna put
a killer behind bars.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.140
You should feel good about that.
That's a good thing.

38:37.190 --> 38:38.350
No, it's not a good thing, Luke!

38:41.611 --> 38:42.851
You know, maybe it's right.

38:42.904 --> 38:46.567
Maybe it's... it's a part
of being a good cop.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.026
But you know what?
I don't even know anymore.

38:50.703 --> 38:53.035
All I know is that he was a good kid.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.038
He was a decent kid.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.292
You know what? This isn't--
This isn't even about the bullet.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.794
Okay? It's--
It's not about the bullet.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.129
I don't know if I can--

39:08.471 --> 39:11.304
Even if it's right,
I cannot be this kind of cop.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.924
People are gonna get hurt.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.177
People are gonna die--
good people,

39:17.230 --> 39:19.812
no matter what we do,
in spite of what we do.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.728
I'm sorry, Officer McNally,

39:23.778 --> 39:26.315
it doesn't matter what kind of cop
you want to be.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.777
That's just something
you're gonna have to get used to.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.659
That's the reality. That's the job.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.586
Why don't you let me finish this up?

39:43.798 --> 39:45.004
I'll meet you at the Penny.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.008
(scoffs)

39:54.517 --> 39:55.973
(door opens)

39:56.019 --> 39:57.350
(sighs)

39:57.395 --> 39:58.805
(door closes)

40:01.024 --> 40:02.639
(sighs)

40:03.818 --> 40:05.399
Are you coming for a drink, pal?

40:05.445 --> 40:06.685
(chuckles) Unh-unh.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.070
Oh, so you're still feelin' it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.276
Just hair of the dog, my friend.
It's the only cure.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.657
(laughs)

40:12.702 --> 40:16.411
Yeah. Yeah. No,
I'm just waitin' for my keys.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.988
And you, my friend, ought to go
straight home and go to bed.

40:19.042 --> 40:22.660
Yeah, yeah. You're taking care
of everybody today.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.038
Are you, uh,
are you waiting for your rookie?

40:27.091 --> 40:29.753
No, I told you.
I'm waiting for my keys.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.054
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, uh, Sammy,

40:32.889 --> 40:34.220
training officers and rookies...

40:35.642 --> 40:36.722
can't...

40:37.810 --> 40:40.893
I'm gonna go.
I'll be at the Penny if you...

40:40.939 --> 40:43.180
- want, uh... anything.
- All right.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.221
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.435
- Um...
- Okay.

40:45.485 --> 40:46.520
Yeah, good night.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.895
Thank you for the car.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.107
Heard about your witness.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.993
(groans)
Yeah, he was never a witness.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.078
He was always just evidence.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.124
lt's... Thisjob is...

41:05.755 --> 41:08.588
I guess ljust have
to get used to it, right?

41:12.470 --> 41:13.505
You need anything?

41:14.764 --> 41:17.050
Want to go for a drink?
Need a ride home?

41:17.100 --> 41:18.806
No. ljust need to...

41:20.645 --> 41:22.727
Actually, what do you know
about plumbing?

41:22.772 --> 41:25.809
(chuckles) Jump in.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.890
Can't wait to see where this is going.
