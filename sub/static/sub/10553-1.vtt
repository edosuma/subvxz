- I had a really excellent time,
thanks, Auntie Violet.
- What did you do?

01:28:59.388 --> 01:29:02.619
Um, we all went to a club
on Friday night,

01:29:02.692 --> 01:29:06.719
and then we went to Connie's
parents' house for a big party.

- How did you get there?
- Jip drove us.

01:29:12.067 --> 01:29:16.232
- He hadn't been drinking?
- No, no.

No, he hadn't
touched a drop.

going off with other people,

of last Friday.

when this happened as well.

- Life is full of
fucking surprises, man.

"Fuckin' hell! I'm never
gonna have sex again
for the rest of my life."

I've ever had...

you know what I mean?

going to get better.
