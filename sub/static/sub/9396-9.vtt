00:00.343 --> 00:01.714
Previously on One Tree Hill.

00:01.772 --> 00:04.235
I knew this meant a lot to you. I bought it back.

00:06.483 --> 00:07.332
You like her, huh?

00:07.393 --> 00:10.108
Yeah, but guys like me don’t get girls like her.

00:10.169 --> 00:12.436
Felix, you took care of me?

00:12.867 --> 00:13.619
Yeah…

00:15.539 --> 00:17.194
Sometimes you gotta break the rules.

00:19.015 --> 00:22.950
Relax, it’s cool. Peyton and I did a couple of lines the other night. Aint that right Peyton?

00:23.015 --> 00:26.825
You’ve got a good sound… and watching you tonight, I could definitely see us doing something together.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.156
- So you won’t be alone tonight. 
- Nope.

00:28.216 --> 00:31.381
- What’re you gonna do until then? 
- Probably just gonna… hang out with Brooke.

00:31.790 --> 00:37.044
Where do you go when you’re lonely, 
I’ll follow you.

00:37.101 --> 00:40.388
This is… the first time I’ve been in a church since my mom died.

00:41.472 --> 00:43.762
I think about her every day.

00:44.048 --> 00:48.722
Dan has a heart condition known as HCM. It’s a… genetic mutation.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.904
Come on man, what are the odds of us even having this thing anyway?

00:51.001 --> 00:51.918
Fifty-fifty.

00:52.255 --> 00:54.968
I’m sorry. I don’t wanna know.

00:55.194 --> 00:57.196
- You like my sister? 
- You know I do.

00:57.489 --> 00:59.121
Stay the hell away from her.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:47.556 --> 01:50.727
Good morning! Rise and shine!

01:52.704 --> 01:56.313
I slaved, all morning, over the toaster, making my famous raisin waffles so eat up.

01:56.881 --> 01:59.069
Somebody wants to go to that… crummy Formal.

01:59.164 --> 02:01.433
Crummy? How could you say that?

02:01.499 --> 02:06.446
We get to hang out with our friends and get all dressed up and slow dance. How can you not be excited?

02:06.553 --> 02:08.401
Because my parents are chaperones.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.893
Okay, well there’s that. So what? Safety in numbers; I got your back.

02:12.158 --> 02:14.141
Do we really have to go to this stupid dance?

02:14.258 --> 02:15.677
Alright, well, maybe not. I mean...

02:16.550 --> 02:19.885
once I get you in that tux, maybe I’ll decide we should stay in…

02:20.935 --> 02:24.729
- Just… don’t leave me alone with them. 
- Okay. I promise.

02:27.719 --> 02:28.958
So good.

02:29.127 --> 02:29.869
My turn.

02:35.515 --> 02:39.254
Think of all the taffeta that had to die to make this thing.

02:41.944 --> 02:45.034
Oh, look! Oh!

02:45.486 --> 02:48.506
Maybe I could just buy it, keep the tags on and return it the next day.

02:48.558 --> 02:51.374
I mean it’s a Formal, I’m not gonna be wearing it for that long anyway.

02:51.686 --> 02:52.511
I hope.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.471
- What do you think? 
- No.

02:55.433 --> 02:56.243
Really?

02:59.283 --> 03:01.009
Just as well, it’s too much anyway.

03:09.008 --> 03:11.598
You are so not my best friend anymore!

03:11.819 --> 03:14.675
And what if I told you I was buying it for you!?

03:14.844 --> 03:17.108
You are so my best friend again!

03:17.372 --> 03:22.632
So, P. Sawyer, thank you for buying me the dress and if you try and take it back, I’m gonna have to bite you.

03:22.866 --> 03:24.597
But what are you gonna wear to this thing?

03:24.674 --> 03:27.398
Oh, I got it covered. I just came on this little outing for you!

03:27.546 --> 03:30.466
Oh. Well you are gonna be the best Formal date I’ve ever had.

03:30.512 --> 03:33.313
- And not Felix? 
- Against the rules,

03:33.376 --> 03:36.005
but Felix… has been kinda sweet lately.

03:36.081 --> 03:39.754
I might have to start giving him the benefit of the doubt instead of just the benefit.

03:40.020 --> 03:40.761
Okay.

03:41.622 --> 03:45.395
Hey look, I gotta go to the club and pick some stuff up. But I’ll call you later.

03:45.728 --> 03:48.028
Okay. Thanks for this, Peyton.

03:48.114 --> 03:49.461
Hey, anything.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.203
I don’t hear any shoplifting alarms.

03:55.450 --> 03:56.261
New dress?

03:56.649 --> 03:58.810
My Formal date, Peyton, bought it for me.

03:59.169 --> 04:01.197
I don’t suppose you have a date to this thing?

04:01.595 --> 04:03.131
I was thinking about asking you.

04:03.349 --> 04:05.728
But, that would’ve violated rule number two.

04:06.562 --> 04:11.635
Well, you know what they say – it’s not who you take to Formal, it’s who you take home.

04:27.579 --> 04:30.287
Stay away from my sister… means stay away from me too.

04:30.401 --> 04:32.703
- Just wanna talk to you. 
- We got nothing to talk about.

04:34.035 --> 04:35.720
I’m taking Anna to the Formal.

04:38.936 --> 04:44.383
Look, I don’t have a sister, but I’ve got Hales and I know how protective I am of her.

04:45.597 --> 04:47.686
So I get why those pictures set you off.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.324
But the one you found…

04:50.697 --> 04:52.846
I never even saw it until you showed it to me.

04:52.949 --> 04:54.091
But you had the other half.

04:54.854 --> 04:57.271
You coulda used it to win ‘Dare Night’. Why didn’t you?

04:58.473 --> 04:59.938
Anna isn’t a game to me.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.625
I’d never do anything to hurt her.

05:06.666 --> 05:08.550
Fine… take her to Formal…

05:08.979 --> 05:11.673
but you screw up with her, I’m cutting in.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.049
It’s you and me who are gonna dance.

05:33.109 --> 05:34.761
- Hey.
- He-hey.

05:34.882 --> 05:36.228
I picked up your tux.

05:37.629 --> 05:42.373
- Uh, I still think you should stay home. 
- Oh, and miss a chance of seeing Nathan?

05:42.756 --> 05:46.480
- Dan, the doctor said – 
- It’s a Formal Deb, not a marathon.

05:48.369 --> 05:51.199
Hey, what’s really bothering you?

05:52.976 --> 05:55.147
Karen… is chaperoning too.

05:56.713 --> 06:00.846
How many times do I have to say it? I’m sorry I told her about you and Keith.

06:01.009 --> 06:03.525
Honestly, I thought you would have told her yourself; you two being friends.

06:03.585 --> 06:05.868
That’s exactly why I didn’t tell her.

06:05.925 --> 06:08.491
You lied to spare her feelings, I understand that.

06:09.094 --> 06:11.408
But sometimes lies have a way of catching up with us.

06:23.681 --> 06:24.316
Hello?

06:24.409 --> 06:27.844
Hello, Lucas Scott? This is Doctor Mitchell, your father’s cardiologist.

06:28.653 --> 06:33.650
The doctor I referred your brother to notified me that you refused your HCM test. Can you tell me why?

06:35.150 --> 06:40.471
I guess I’d… rather risk a short full life than… have a long empty one.

06:40.552 --> 06:44.357
Well, with the right treatment, you won’t have to do either one. Look at your father.

06:44.786 --> 06:48.037
Yeah, he practically needs a… twenty-four hour babysitter.

06:48.170 --> 06:51.242
Well that’s not true. He’s had a clean bill of health for weeks now;

06:51.324 --> 06:53.138
passed every test with flying colours.

06:53.439 --> 06:56.347
I urge you to reconsider Lucas. Please think about it.

07:08.318 --> 07:08.958
Hey.

07:09.868 --> 07:10.438
Hey.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.880
So, I had a little brush with your friend Karen.

07:13.202 --> 07:14.165
She found out.

07:14.421 --> 07:16.859
Hey, look, it’s cool. We’ll work around her, that’s all.

07:17.201 --> 07:19.418
Here’s some bands I think that might work for your club.

07:20.130 --> 07:22.445
Like what you hear, just give me a shout.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.283
I gotta go, alright?

07:25.942 --> 07:28.102
There’s a little something in there… for you too.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.244
Andy, that’s fine. Alright, I’ll see you when you get back.

07:55.314 --> 07:58.032
- Andy down-under? 
- Oh, New York for a seminar.

07:59.184 --> 08:01.254
Hey, there she is.

08:01.587 --> 08:05.084
Give my trusty club promoter a sack on the house. She’s earned it.

08:05.155 --> 08:05.780
Alright.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.511
Sup girly?!

08:07.803 --> 08:11.099
Actually, this trusty club promoter needs a favour.

08:11.233 --> 08:12.113
Alright.

08:12.322 --> 08:15.333
How would you feel about playing TRIC next weekend?

08:15.416 --> 08:17.689
And I don’t mean just… one or two songs.

08:17.796 --> 08:20.106
I mean… like a whole set.

08:20.279 --> 08:23.613
- Oh, wow, I’m flattered but I can’t. 
- Why not?!

08:23.705 --> 08:24.715
Cos I don’t have a set.

08:24.949 --> 08:26.123
I got plenty of songs.

08:26.569 --> 08:30.444
Really! See, that’s weird cos I wouldn’t know that. I’ve never even heard him play one.

08:30.546 --> 08:33.331
Ah, but you know, let’s just skip to the track where you tell me you want me to play.

08:33.423 --> 08:35.337
How do I know you’re not gonna screw me again?

08:35.429 --> 08:36.602
Been there, done that.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.741
Are you gonna have a list of crazy demands?

08:38.820 --> 08:39.856
Yeah, but just one;

08:40.345 --> 08:41.580
Haley plays with me.

08:42.025 --> 08:44.907
Uh… do you really think I’m ready for that?

08:44.970 --> 08:47.653
Uh, no. But you will be if we rehearse tonight.

08:47.724 --> 08:49.830
Oh, I can’t tonight. Tonight’s the Formal.

08:49.966 --> 08:54.615
Hmm, just as well; I don’t really wanna play with someone who’s not… totally committed.

08:54.769 --> 08:56.679
Not with record labels in the audience.

08:58.045 --> 08:59.079
I have interest.

08:59.981 --> 09:01.537
But you just went off that prom.

09:06.455 --> 09:08.060
Alright, fine, I’ll be there.

09:15.663 --> 09:21.347
Check it out. I got tipped off – Haley is gonna get crowed queen tonight.

09:21.941 --> 09:23.549
Wow, that’s great. Does she know?

09:23.636 --> 09:25.930
No. I’ve totally been acting like I don’t even wanna go.

09:26.488 --> 09:28.837
I’ve actually got a pretty incredible night lined up for her though.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.719
Haley, queen of the Formal. Now that’s hard to believe –

09:32.770 --> 09:37.081
considering… last years Formal, we spent playing miniature golf and making fun of the whole thing.

09:37.552 --> 09:39.170
Now I’m hanging out with you losers.

09:39.774 --> 09:40.358
Hey.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.221
I feel stupid; going without a date.

09:50.809 --> 09:53.706
Events like these are loaded with emotionally vulnerable girls.

09:54.095 --> 09:55.309
Ripe for the picking.

09:55.707 --> 09:58.565
Some other sucker buys the flowers… and you pluck the petals.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.586
I think petal-plucking is more your style.

10:01.748 --> 10:02.834
What’s that supposed to mean?

10:04.007 --> 10:06.551
It means… I want something more with a girl.

10:07.612 --> 10:09.368
Yeah, well maybe I do too Mouth.

10:10.648 --> 10:11.420
Or not!

10:32.480 --> 10:33.110
Hey!

10:35.839 --> 10:37.979
Oh, is this your dress?

10:38.634 --> 10:42.648
Yeah. It was my mom’s. She wore it to her Formal.

10:43.012 --> 10:46.161
Ah, so your mom was wearing vintage in the eighties.

10:46.252 --> 10:46.858
No.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.318
I know she would have loved to have seen you in it.

10:50.932 --> 10:51.665
Thanks.

10:52.135 --> 10:54.531
Well at least some part of her will be with me tonight.

10:55.510 --> 10:58.223
It’s gonna be a great night. Just the two of us.

10:58.826 --> 10:59.581
Hey!

11:00.998 --> 11:01.868
Or not.

11:02.028 --> 11:05.908
Its Anna’s first Formal so… I thought maybe we could all get ready together.

11:06.021 --> 11:08.903
- Cool. 
- Besides, Felix is at home, hogging the mirror.

11:10.645 --> 11:13.184
Um… I could use some help with my hair.

11:15.309 --> 11:19.144
What do you think Lucas prefers? Straight… or curly?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.414
Half and half?

11:33.747 --> 11:39.548
Dancing where the stars go blue, 
Dancing –

11:40.106 --> 11:42.180
- Nathan!
- Hales, come on, it sounded amazing!

11:42.267 --> 11:46.229
That is a work in progress and you have a habit of sending out things before they’re finished!

11:46.317 --> 11:47.995
Well, you see how well that turned out.

11:48.595 --> 11:50.990
And when… when did you find the time to record this?

11:51.113 --> 11:53.397
Oh just… when you were in Charlotte; over the weekend.

11:53.853 --> 11:57.907
Oh… shoot. Um… Okay, so something’s come up.

11:59.086 --> 12:03.510
Peyton wants me to play the next TRIC night… with… with Chris.

12:04.277 --> 12:06.521
Haley… come on, you don’t need that guy.

12:06.602 --> 12:08.864
He’s got connections and they’re gonna see me play and…

12:08.952 --> 12:12.561
it’s just really important that I rehearse with him. Starting tonight.

12:13.089 --> 12:15.634
- Hales!
- Well, come on, I’m just gonna be a little bit late.

12:15.710 --> 12:17.497
We won’t miss anything. I promise.

12:18.036 --> 12:20.078
Okay? Promise.

12:32.622 --> 12:35.075
So… whaddaya think? Do I like it?

12:35.152 --> 12:38.306
You love it! And… it’s gonna be in here,

12:38.480 --> 12:41.331
you know, just in case you need a post-Lucas touch-up.

12:41.664 --> 12:42.884
Stop it!

12:44.517 --> 12:47.695
By the way, your room is… incredible.

12:47.798 --> 12:48.817
Ah, thank you.

12:51.699 --> 12:53.671
So… who’s that?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.533
Oh, that’s… that’s Jake and Jenny.

12:57.384 --> 13:00.675
Or at least it was. They… had to move away.

13:01.315 --> 13:02.574
Do you… keep in touch?

13:02.887 --> 13:04.039
No, not really.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.183
I mean, I’ve rung him a couple of times but he hasn’t responded so…

13:08.273 --> 13:09.763
I guess he has his reasons.

13:11.934 --> 13:12.737
Okay.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.984
If you were a guy, would this dress do it for you?

13:16.070 --> 13:17.193
- You look awesome. 
- Yeah!

13:17.300 --> 13:17.955
Spin!

13:24.229 --> 13:26.239
‘Dreams… Do Come True’.

13:26.865 --> 13:28.165
Well… One per ticket.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.592
Then I’ll be careful what I wish for.

13:33.950 --> 13:36.112
- Mouth, you coming? 
- Ah, in a sec.

13:36.194 --> 13:39.869
Felix told me to wait five minutes before going in so we don’t look like a couple.

13:40.381 --> 13:41.093
Come on.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.110
Thank you.

14:09.136 --> 14:11.275
Okay, let’s get a table and do a laugh.

14:11.353 --> 14:12.898
Oh, Anna’s saving us seats at her table.

14:13.893 --> 14:17.687
That’ll be cosy. Do you forget who she’s here with? Do you wanna sit with him?

14:17.768 --> 14:19.831
We’re gonna have to if we’re hanging out with Anna!

14:20.548 --> 14:23.492
Keep this up P. S. and I might just get jealous.

14:23.594 --> 14:24.194
Get?

14:24.995 --> 14:29.151
Wow, look at you Mouth. Looking like James Bond

14:29.247 --> 14:32.687
Thanks! But I feel more like I’m about to pull a rabbit out of something.

14:33.123 --> 14:37.603
Well, first dance of the night goes to… Double-o-seven.

14:38.905 --> 14:39.677
Thank you.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.532
I’m really glad we did this.

14:50.434 --> 14:51.150
Me too.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.283
I mean I like Anna enough and all… but I feel like I just got my friend back

14:58.349 --> 15:01.574
and now somebody’s horning in on her and I don’t feel like I should have to share her!

15:01.656 --> 15:04.089
- Know what I mean? 
- I know exactly what you mean.

15:04.305 --> 15:06.306
That’s why I love you Mouth; you totally get me.

15:06.669 --> 15:08.379
You’re not like the rest of the guys here.

15:08.804 --> 15:09.521
Thanks.

15:10.697 --> 15:13.663
But, sometimes I wish I was like all the other guys.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.672
- They have dates. 
- Are you kidding?!

15:16.761 --> 15:19.731
Girls totally fall for the sensitive guy. Look at Felix;

15:19.926 --> 15:22.490
none of his lame lines did anything for me,

15:22.586 --> 15:26.826
but what did… was when I got wasted at TRIC and he took me home and took care of me.

15:42.351 --> 15:44.010
You don’t approve of me with Brooke, do you?

15:44.927 --> 15:47.250
‘Friends with Benefits’ is crap and you know it.

15:47.871 --> 15:50.461
Wow. Hard to believe you don’t have a date.

15:51.726 --> 15:52.934
I’m here with Brooke.

15:54.009 --> 15:57.699
Yeah… but at the end of the night… I’ll be with Brooke.

15:57.972 --> 15:58.920
Who will you be with?

16:02.442 --> 16:06.467
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

16:07.311 --> 16:13.655
Where do you go when the stars go blue.

16:24.791 --> 16:25.503
What?!

16:26.116 --> 16:27.080
Nothing, it’s fine.

16:28.227 --> 16:29.435
Okay, are you sure?

16:29.654 --> 16:30.443
Yeah.

16:30.775 --> 16:35.405
The only problem is… you know… labels don’t spend millions of dollars promoting fine.

16:35.773 --> 16:38.544
Radio stations don’t put fine into their rotation.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.940
So record execs aren’t gonna come see fine, Haley.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.855
I thought you said you had interest.

16:42.941 --> 16:46.125
I do, and if I had a great demo I can get them to come to TRIC…

16:46.269 --> 16:48.221
but right now the demo’s not great Haley.

16:48.687 --> 16:49.489
It’s just…

16:50.721 --> 16:51.482
fine.

16:52.685 --> 16:56.407
Well… I don’t know, maybe we can just pick it up tomorrow. I’ve gotta go!

16:56.863 --> 16:58.956
Oh, sure… well that’s fine.

17:03.730 --> 17:07.364
Oh hey sweetie, I’m sorry. This is taking a lot longer than I expected.

17:07.451 --> 17:08.474
Well how much longer?

17:12.733 --> 17:16.124
Why don’t you go ahead and I will meet you there not a second later than eight-thirty.

17:16.215 --> 17:16.775
Haley?!

17:16.893 --> 17:17.394
I’m sorry.

17:17.491 --> 17:20.609
What’s the big deal, I mean, so we miss a few minutes, you didn’t wanna go anyway, right?

17:22.667 --> 17:25.207
Okay. Alright, I’ll see you there.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.221
Okay, love you.

17:35.315 --> 17:39.185
Sorry, uh… you go ahead and take off.

17:39.431 --> 17:40.695
I’m not gonna need you after all.

17:55.314 --> 17:58.186
Bout time you showed up! Where’s the whip and chain?

17:58.350 --> 18:01.478
Ball and chain Tim. She’ll be here.

18:01.596 --> 18:02.359
Whatever.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.451
So how long we gotta hang here until operation ‘Reets the Beach’.

18:05.548 --> 18:08.308
Until you finish operation ‘What the Hell Are You Talking About?’.

18:08.446 --> 18:10.530
The party man. Your parents beach house?

18:10.622 --> 18:12.680
You gotta get the key first. Remember the plan?

18:12.763 --> 18:13.592
You know it!

18:14.124 --> 18:17.411
Uh-oh Phoenix and Psycho… on your twenty.

18:17.842 --> 18:19.972
Tim… just say my parents are here.

18:21.651 --> 18:24.933
Nathan. Hi Tim. You two look very handsome.

18:25.302 --> 18:27.826
Thanks mom. Dad.

18:27.913 --> 18:30.596
Nice corsage. Where’s the girl to go with it?

18:31.062 --> 18:34.226
Haley’s… recording some music right now. She’ll be here soon.

18:35.470 --> 18:37.774
Well I’m… I’m sure she’s making an effort.

18:38.670 --> 18:40.804
Which means that my first dance is with you.

18:42.940 --> 18:44.164
I’d be delighted.

18:57.128 --> 18:58.663
Don’t ask me to dance, Tim.

19:03.984 --> 19:05.310
Mouth?! What the hell?

19:05.401 --> 19:06.614
That’s what I wanna know.

19:06.734 --> 19:09.518
You told Brooke you were the one that got her home the night of the TRIC opening.

19:09.637 --> 19:14.050
So? You took first shift, I was the closer. What difference does it make?

19:14.127 --> 19:15.305
Why would you do that?

19:17.142 --> 19:19.257
The same reason I gave you the money for the dollhouse.

19:19.355 --> 19:20.986
So, what? You’re saying you’re really into her?

19:21.315 --> 19:22.487
It’s like you said Mouth;

19:23.281 --> 19:24.496
I want more too.

19:25.318 --> 19:26.250
With Brooke.

19:40.576 --> 19:43.751
You know, I always thought I’d have the first dance at your wedding.

19:45.947 --> 19:49.531
Sorry. I’m not here to give you grief, I just…

19:49.908 --> 19:51.707
I wanna make sure you’re happy.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.829
When’s the last time you were happy mom?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.601
When we were a family.

19:58.307 --> 20:01.251
And taking shots at me won’t make Haley get here any faster.

20:02.783 --> 20:07.044
I don’t get it Nathan, I try to show some concern… and all I get is attitude.

20:07.641 --> 20:10.990
And Haley abandons you at your Formal and she gets a pass?

20:11.092 --> 20:11.763
Yes!

20:12.339 --> 20:12.996
What?

20:13.186 --> 20:15.880
Whatever. Uh… thanks for the dance, mom.

20:16.211 --> 20:19.693
- The song is not over Nathan. 
- Yeah but… the dance is.

20:22.843 --> 20:27.512
Glow when the stars go blue.

20:29.432 --> 20:30.666
That was good!

20:31.991 --> 20:33.164
That sounded better.

20:33.431 --> 20:34.448
Better than good?

20:34.864 --> 20:36.128
Well, better than crap.

20:36.227 --> 20:39.217
Oh, that’s nice, that’s what I think I’ll name my first album; ‘Better than Crap’.

20:40.737 --> 20:41.822
Nah, it sounded good.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.148
Is that clock right?

20:46.778 --> 20:48.146
Uh, no, I unplugged it.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.440
You what?!

20:49.743 --> 20:51.596
You were that close to nailing it.

20:52.267 --> 20:54.592
- What time is it?! 
- Nine and change.

20:54.719 --> 20:58.784
Oh my god! I can not believe you did that. Nathan is gonna kill me!

20:58.903 --> 21:00.530
No, just play him the track. He’ll understand.

21:00.618 --> 21:02.087
No, trust me, he won’t.

21:10.740 --> 21:11.815
Having fun yet?

21:13.428 --> 21:14.166
Depends.

21:15.236 --> 21:16.414
Will I see you later?

21:16.967 --> 21:21.181
Depends. Maybe I’ll have a couple of drinks and let you rescue me again.

21:31.492 --> 21:33.489
Hey, have you seen Peyton?

21:33.576 --> 21:35.844
Yeah, she’s looking pretty fine.

21:36.488 --> 21:38.477
No, I need to borrow her lipstick.

21:38.624 --> 21:39.868
Which one’s her purse?

21:39.991 --> 21:43.401
Oh, it’s the fake findy baguette… I mean, I guess.

22:10.030 --> 22:11.137
Hey Nate, you mind standing watch?

22:11.235 --> 22:13.437
Watch what, you mean the lightweight or the flask.

22:14.770 --> 22:16.794
I just thought like… with Haley.

22:17.209 --> 22:18.054
D’ya see her here?

22:22.683 --> 22:24.090
I’ll have what he’s having.

22:25.109 --> 22:27.378
Say a… death wish isn’t it?

22:28.750 --> 22:32.017
I can pretend to know what you’re talking about, or you can just tell me.

22:32.107 --> 22:34.925
My cardiologist told me you backed out of your HCM test.

22:36.302 --> 22:38.231
Better than lying about the results.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.156
And what does that mean?

22:41.902 --> 22:43.470
Your doc told me you aced the test.

22:43.986 --> 22:46.402
Guess you were… planning on keeping that to yourself.

22:47.274 --> 22:48.650
Alright, I deserved that.

22:49.973 --> 22:53.541
But I lied because I’m trying to get my wife back and I can’t do that if I’m not in her life.

22:55.143 --> 22:57.176
Sounds like a good way to rationalise…

22:57.853 --> 23:00.791
but even though you can blow the lines, it’s still a lie

23:00.852 --> 23:03.059
- and you don’t lie to the people you love. 
- Is that right?

23:03.668 --> 23:07.145
Well then tell me something – does you mom know? That you backed out of your heart test?

23:07.597 --> 23:09.326
Or is that part kind of blurry?

23:16.065 --> 23:17.135
Can I talk to you?

23:17.672 --> 23:18.680
Yeah, what’s up?

23:18.828 --> 23:21.830
Hey, no secrets… unless they’re juicy.

23:23.754 --> 23:27.538
I guess I’m not used to seeing my little sis… in anything other than a Catholic school uniform.

23:28.787 --> 23:30.309
I think she looks gorgeous.

23:32.842 --> 23:35.413
Wow, I didn’t know this was a lesbian mixer.

23:39.166 --> 23:41.966
Yeah! Don’t be so gay, Peyton.

23:51.047 --> 23:52.095
Care to dance?

24:17.455 --> 24:18.236
Peyton.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.871
Oh no. Bad night?

24:23.014 --> 24:25.835
No, um… I’m okay. It’s just…

24:26.439 --> 24:28.440
Not exactly a ‘Dream Come True’?

24:29.137 --> 24:29.885
Yeah.

24:31.385 --> 24:34.795
Well it could be worse. My Formal, I went with Dan.

24:35.927 --> 24:37.105
Well there’s a smile.

24:38.723 --> 24:41.117
Now come on, get out there and have some fun.

24:41.533 --> 24:44.462
You… can’t let a stunning dress like that go to waste.

24:45.313 --> 24:47.374
Thanks, it was my mom’s.

24:51.288 --> 24:54.359
Oh Peyton. Oh!

24:57.396 --> 25:01.542
You know. I don’t know what it’s like to have a daughter…

25:02.331 --> 25:04.794
but I do know what it’s like to be a mother and…

25:04.875 --> 25:07.533
yours would be so proud of the woman you’ve become.

25:09.546 --> 25:13.492
- Oh, I didn’t mean to go make you sad. 
- No, no. Um… I’m gonna be fine.

25:14.496 --> 25:15.396
I know you are.

25:18.659 --> 25:19.770
I know you are.

25:26.474 --> 25:27.434
Excuse me.

25:28.182 --> 25:29.948
Brooke! I need to talk to you.

25:30.046 --> 25:32.652
Um… can it wait, just a second? Cos I’m running to the ladies.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.669
I didn’t buy your dollhouse.

25:36.436 --> 25:41.022
So what, you stole it? Why Mr Bond, you are a scoundrel.

25:41.106 --> 25:45.975
Felix bought it. He just wanted me to say I did so he wouldn’t break your stupid rules.

25:48.718 --> 25:51.319
And after the club opening I’m the one who took you home.

25:51.430 --> 25:54.908
I took care of you, not Felix, me. And I did it because I-

25:54.985 --> 25:56.316
So you both lied to me?

25:57.074 --> 26:00.525
- Brooke– 
- Mouth, I can not believe you, I thought we were friends!

26:01.723 --> 26:06.178
Guess I was wrong. Oh, and by the way, congratulations,

26:06.234 --> 26:08.753
you got your wish because you are just like every other guy!

26:21.026 --> 26:23.837
So I guess you’re gonna tell my mom about me not taking that test right?

26:24.646 --> 26:26.530
Don’t worry Lucas, your secrets safe with me.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.447
For now, cos I’m not gonna tell your mother, you are.

26:34.575 --> 26:36.621
I know you Lucas; you’ll do the right thing.

26:39.022 --> 26:41.184
Alright, if I could have your attention please!

26:41.496 --> 26:43.924
- Call me back as soon as you get this Hales. 
- Everybody, if you could gather around.

26:43.990 --> 26:48.000
- I’m starting to freak out a little bit. 
- The votes are in for Tree Hill High’s king and queen.

26:48.327 --> 26:51.433
As you know, over the last week, the student body was asked to cast a vote...

26:51.534 --> 26:55.628
- Nathan! I’m so sorry I’m late. I just… 
- Come on, come on we gotta hurry, we gotta hurry.

26:55.709 --> 26:58.546
Clock at the studio stopped and… ow! Have you been drinking?

26:58.655 --> 26:59.555
Just a little bit.

26:59.653 --> 27:02.590
This years, Tree Hill High, king and queen are… Nathan and Haley Scott!

27:12.022 --> 27:13.823
- Nathan! 
- Surprise!

27:13.982 --> 27:15.543
- But this- 
- Come on, come on.

27:15.688 --> 27:17.572
I told you, this song isn’t ready yet!

27:17.770 --> 27:20.132
I know, but you’re too critical. Everyone’s gonna love it.

27:21.575 --> 27:23.450
I told the DJ to play it if you won.

27:23.527 --> 27:26.374
This is your night Hales. I want it to be perfect.

27:30.897 --> 27:34.155
Wait, is that… is that Chris?

27:37.033 --> 27:39.752
You told me that I was in Charlotte when you recorded this.

27:40.260 --> 27:42.173
You were with Chris then and you didn’t tell me?

27:44.656 --> 27:47.089
Nathan, I was going to tell you, I swear.

27:47.320 --> 27:51.062
Yeah? You’re a little late. For the second time tonight.

28:11.409 --> 28:15.023
You know, I’m having a hard time getting my head around how you could be pissed at me.

28:15.571 --> 28:18.582
Because you deliberately did something I asked you not to!

28:18.675 --> 28:21.147
Whatever! I spent the whole night waiting for you;

28:21.214 --> 28:24.624
planning everything, dodging my parents… all while you were with Chris!

28:24.731 --> 28:28.535
- Can we leave him out of this please? 
- Why? Are you into him?

28:30.020 --> 28:32.837
You know what, it really hurts me that you even have to ask me that.

28:34.824 --> 28:36.579
Not as much as it hurts me.

29:00.221 --> 29:01.252
Still drinking?

29:03.438 --> 29:04.556
Not anymore.

29:16.262 --> 29:18.440
Make sure the door’s locked, okay?

29:31.486 --> 29:32.895
We don’t have to rush this.

29:34.533 --> 29:35.957
I don’t understand.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.939
- Aren’t you into me? 
- Oh, of course I am.

29:41.941 --> 29:46.329
I just promised myself that… I’d be in love next time.

29:46.631 --> 29:51.019
And… I’d really get to know the person first.

29:51.380 --> 29:55.627
And we’re still doing that. And I love… where it’s going…

29:56.479 --> 30:03.615
but I’m… just not ready, Anna. Not yet.

30:09.006 --> 30:10.041
I’m such an idiot.

30:13.599 --> 30:14.629
Don’t say that.

30:18.178 --> 30:22.528
Look, Anna, my parents rushed into things…

30:24.223 --> 30:26.103
look how badly I turned out.

30:27.987 --> 30:34.862
Look, I just… I wanna make sure that this is right. You know?

30:38.815 --> 30:41.836
I’m sorry. I am so embarrassed.

30:41.904 --> 30:45.251
Hey… don’t be.

30:46.459 --> 30:49.219
No, I know I’ve been sending you mixed signals.

30:50.985 --> 30:54.284
First I’m telling you to go slow and then I’m… taking my dress off.

30:55.522 --> 30:57.084
I don’t know what I’m doing.

30:59.229 --> 31:00.242
I do.

31:03.305 --> 31:06.101
We’re going for a walk on the beach. Come on.

31:07.717 --> 31:11.226
Thank you Lucas but… I think I just wanna… go home.

31:14.807 --> 31:17.451
Okay. I’ll take you.

31:17.978 --> 31:18.751
No!

31:20.421 --> 31:22.132
It’s not you, it’s just…

31:24.138 --> 31:27.251
I’m all over the place and I just need to… clear my head.

31:29.242 --> 31:30.199
I’m sorry.

31:38.711 --> 31:39.570
Hey.

31:51.769 --> 31:53.993
Oh, hey Mouth, have you seen Brooke?

31:54.197 --> 31:58.114
Yeah, she’s… ‘Benefiting’ with Felix.

32:07.024 --> 32:08.223
Oh my god.

32:09.002 --> 32:09.911
I’m sorry.

32:22.787 --> 32:24.826
I was wondering when you were gonna share the love.

32:25.942 --> 32:27.294
There is no love.

32:27.749 --> 32:29.792
We don’t do love. Do you know why?

32:30.155 --> 32:32.953
Cos it’s against the rules. But I wanna talk to you about that Brooke because-

32:33.055 --> 32:34.433
You paid for my dollhouse?

32:34.590 --> 32:38.315
Oh, and then you lied to me; about taking me home that night after TRIC. 

32:39.130 --> 32:40.415
- Brooke I- 
- Don’t!

32:40.814 --> 32:44.684
I almost believed you were a decent guy; somebody that could care about me but you know what?

32:44.789 --> 32:47.759
I have been lied to before, Felix, and it almost killed me!

32:49.289 --> 32:50.359
Brooke!

32:52.738 --> 32:55.285
- I’m not like Lucas. 
- No, you’re not.

32:55.587 --> 32:58.362
You know why? Because I am not gonna let you in!

32:58.490 --> 33:02.289
You don’t get to have me; not my body and sure as hell not my heart!

33:03.276 --> 33:04.143
We’re done!

33:21.857 --> 33:22.652
Please!

34:01.237 --> 34:02.035
God.

34:18.101 --> 34:21.748
Listen, I want you to know something; I don’t have feelings for Chris, okay?

34:22.956 --> 34:27.168
The only reason I didn’t tell you about that song is because… I know you don’t like him.

34:28.556 --> 34:31.311
I don’t get you Nathan, you know, you encourage me to do this music thing

34:31.382 --> 34:33.391
and than… now that Chris is involved you just-

34:33.446 --> 34:35.806
- You don’t need that guy, Haley! 
- He helps me.

34:38.295 --> 34:41.561
- You don’t need to feel threatened by that. 
- You think I’m threatened?

34:42.938 --> 34:46.585
I know it must be hard for you; seeing me have something like this

34:46.656 --> 34:48.838
when you didn’t get into basketball camp but…

34:49.795 --> 34:52.217
it’s just not fair for you to take it out on me.

34:52.329 --> 34:53.449
I’ll tell you what Haley.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.224
Go home… and look in my top drawer.

34:57.946 --> 34:59.759
You’ll see a letter, from High Flyers.

35:00.593 --> 35:03.589
Read that… then talk to me about fair.

35:23.503 --> 35:24.523
Rough night?

35:25.628 --> 35:27.074
Yeah, you could say that.

35:28.641 --> 35:31.432
Peyton, I’m sorry for what I said to you earlier.

35:31.513 --> 35:35.041
Everybody was laughing and… I don’t know what came over me.

35:35.128 --> 35:35.835
Don’t worry about it.

35:35.922 --> 35:39.880
No, I do worry about it! We just started to be friends and… I blow it!

35:39.955 --> 35:42.747
It’s okay… Anna, we all do stupid things.

35:43.238 --> 35:45.142
I’ve… done my fair share.

35:45.614 --> 35:50.452
Peyton, at Haley’s slumber party, you said you wanted to be able to talk about anything.

35:51.030 --> 35:55.009
Well… I went into your purse, earlier, to borrow your lipstick and…

35:55.307 --> 35:58.812
It’s okay, Anna; I already flushed it down the toilet.

35:59.899 --> 36:01.834
I’ve only done it that one time.

36:02.510 --> 36:06.201
I’ve just… been fighting it.

36:13.609 --> 36:15.423
Does it have anything to do with this?

36:16.394 --> 36:18.141
Yeah, that and everything else.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.689
I know what you mean.

36:22.231 --> 36:24.669
I made a fool of myself with Lucas tonight.

36:26.819 --> 36:29.415
Why do relationships have to be so hard?

36:30.937 --> 36:33.501
Because the only thing harder is being alone.

36:36.747 --> 36:39.252
Look, you can crash here tonight if you want to.

36:39.881 --> 36:40.655
Are you sure?

36:42.293 --> 36:43.132
Yeah.

36:44.090 --> 36:45.494
It’s nice to have some company.

37:08.405 --> 37:09.664
Is this beach taken?

37:10.474 --> 37:12.112
There’s plenty to go around.

37:14.590 --> 37:17.865
Don’t worry; I’m not gonna ask you if you’re okay.

37:18.568 --> 37:19.387
Thanks.

37:24.031 --> 37:25.255
Know any good jokes?

37:27.318 --> 37:28.619
You’re looking at one.

37:35.249 --> 37:36.995
Why does everybody lie?

37:38.680 --> 37:41.131
You know, the bad guys lie to get in your bed…

37:41.885 --> 37:44.829
and the good guys… lie to get in your heart.

37:48.116 --> 37:51.541
And I’m the idiot that falls for it every time.

37:51.656 --> 37:56.804
Hey… Brooke, you are not an idiot. Not even close.

37:57.986 --> 37:59.570
You know who you are.

38:00.593 --> 38:04.494
Most people don’t, you know. I mean, that’s why they lie.

38:06.257 --> 38:10.018
They’re afraid people might find out who they are before they figure it out themselves.

38:21.089 --> 38:22.189
Let me take you home.

38:23.153 --> 38:25.374
I can get home without a guy, thanks.

38:29.716 --> 38:30.566
Okay.

38:33.368 --> 38:34.575
Wait!

38:37.908 --> 38:39.587
I really don’t wanna walk.

39:00.003 --> 39:00.856
Dan?

39:02.652 --> 39:07.061
I’m going back to the beach house. I lied to you Deb; bout the stress test.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.125
The truth is; I passed.

39:10.359 --> 39:12.417
But I lied so that I could keep you near me.

39:16.806 --> 39:19.891
After the meteor shower, I saw that you were slipping away from me…

39:20.282 --> 39:21.967
and my family was slipping away.

39:23.088 --> 39:26.175
And I know now that… nothing’s worth having that’s based on a lie.

39:26.256 --> 39:29.584
You deserve your freedom Deb and in spite of all that’s happened…

39:31.156 --> 39:32.498
I still do love you.

39:35.063 --> 39:36.010
Wait!

39:37.106 --> 39:40.706
You say you want our family to be together again; so do I, Dan.

39:41.843 --> 39:46.210
But damn you if you’re lying; because my heart can’t take much more.

39:48.181 --> 39:49.380
Neither can mine.

41:15.251 --> 41:17.160
So, do you miss being in your old town?

41:18.447 --> 41:19.202
No.

41:20.839 --> 41:26.279
The thing about moving so many times, it’s not the new places that are so bad;

41:26.828 --> 41:31.729
it’s like… not matter where you end up, it’s hard to be yourself when you get there.

41:45.405 --> 41:47.309
So, thanks for breakfast.

41:48.359 --> 41:50.156
We should do this more often.

41:50.658 --> 41:53.489
- Do what? 
- Be friends.

41:54.185 --> 41:55.552
We are friends.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.757
But we should be friends.

42:02.802 --> 42:03.893
I’d like that.

42:06.207 --> 42:07.651
But no benefits.
