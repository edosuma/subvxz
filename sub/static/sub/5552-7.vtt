WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.630
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:04.297 --> 00:05.924
That's for Reggie.

00:06.091 --> 00:07.592
<i>Now, I don't know
what you want with Master Bruce,</i>

00:07.759 --> 00:11.429
but I'm certain that his life's gonna be
a damn sight better without you in it.

00:11.596 --> 00:14.933
I would be honored if you would
consider endorsing me for mayor.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.602
If you can give me your word
that we won't have to face it alone,

00:17.769 --> 00:18.895
you'll have my endorsement.

00:19.062 --> 00:21.064
It's been some time
since I had a meal like this.

00:21.231 --> 00:24.609
You should come over more often.
We can, like, hang out or whatever.

00:24.776 --> 00:25.777
I'd like that.

00:25.944 --> 00:27.195
Let go of me, you freak!

00:27.362 --> 00:28.530
Listen to me!

00:28.697 --> 00:29.906
I did it for you.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.243
Kristen?

00:33.702 --> 00:36.788
And I've been following
the goings-on at Wayne Enterprises.

00:36.955 --> 00:39.374
- What have you learned?
- That your father was a good man.

00:39.541 --> 00:42.419
But in spite of that,
bad things happened at his company.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.048
You were looking for Penguin's mother,
weren't you?

00:47.215 --> 00:48.591
I have to obey him in all things.

00:48.758 --> 00:52.887
Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.
Can we help?

00:57.475 --> 00:58.935
I'll leave you two to it.

01:03.690 --> 01:04.983
<i>Father Creel.</i>

01:07.318 --> 01:09.654
- Do you have the Wayne boy?
- Not yet, but soon.

01:09.821 --> 01:10.822
I found your mother.

01:10.989 --> 01:13.408
- Where?
- In a warehouse down by the port.

01:25.503 --> 01:26.671
You're sure this is it?

01:26.838 --> 01:28.173
<i>I'm sure, boss.</i>

01:28.631 --> 01:30.216
Once my mother is safe,

01:30.842 --> 01:32.844
we go after Galavan and his sister.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.264
They're going to pay
for what they've done.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.481
Mother?

01:44.856 --> 01:46.816
Mother!

01:49.152 --> 01:51.696
You're okay. Thank God!

01:51.988 --> 01:55.867
Oswald? Is that really you?

01:56.743 --> 02:00.997
Your sweet face. Like a vision.

02:01.414 --> 02:03.625
I'm taking you home. Okay?

02:04.375 --> 02:05.710
No, no, no, no.

02:10.507 --> 02:15.053
And there I was thinking you understood
the meaning of consequences.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.055
Consequences, yes.

02:18.056 --> 02:20.850
I assure you
that my understanding of consequences

02:21.017 --> 02:24.229
will be made quite clear
once my mother is outside.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.397
But we've had so much fun together.

02:27.649 --> 02:31.528
My sister gets attached to her playthings,
so I must insist she stay.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.947
And those bolt cutters, useless.

02:34.364 --> 02:35.573
<i>The only way out of there</i>

02:36.866 --> 02:38.243
is with this.

02:40.745 --> 02:41.913
Very well.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.083
Butch, shoot them both in the head
and grab the key.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.919
- Oswald!
- Mother, I'm sorry,

02:48.086 --> 02:50.797
but what they've done to you
will not stand!

02:54.717 --> 02:57.136
I gave you an order!
Shoot them both in the head!

02:59.180 --> 03:00.181
<i>Oswald!</i>

03:03.726 --> 03:04.853
No.

03:05.061 --> 03:07.480
No, no, no. That's not possible.

03:08.565 --> 03:11.776
You have to obey me. You have to!

03:12.569 --> 03:15.989
That time has passed. They fixed me.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.826
Tabi is well versed
in the protocols of conditioning.

03:19.993 --> 03:23.413
There's always a trigger word
implanted during the process.

03:23.872 --> 03:26.541
All I had to do was
get Butch to remember what it is.

03:27.292 --> 03:29.294
I'll admit, it took a few tries.

03:30.295 --> 03:31.629
And now,

03:32.797 --> 03:34.465
here we are.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.430
Please.

03:41.890 --> 03:44.809
I can still be valuable. You'll see.

03:44.976 --> 03:47.395
I so wish that were true.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.564
Then kill me if you must, but let her go.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.650
I'm begging you.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.320
Doesn't look like begging to me.

03:55.486 --> 03:58.239
Indeed. Half-hearted at best.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.370
Please.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.206
I'll do anything.

04:10.001 --> 04:12.754
- Perhaps she has served her purpose.
- Mmm.

04:13.004 --> 04:15.131
Don't pout.
You still have the former mayor.

04:15.298 --> 04:18.009
He's so dull. He just moans all the time.

04:34.359 --> 04:37.153
I told you everything would be okay.
Didn't I?

04:37.612 --> 04:38.947
And it will be.

04:48.039 --> 04:49.082
<i>No!</i>

04:49.874 --> 04:50.917
No!

04:58.549 --> 05:01.886
Oswald? What is wrong?

05:02.178 --> 05:04.681
You look so sad.

05:06.766 --> 05:10.395
Nothing's wrong, Mother. Nothing at all.

05:11.312 --> 05:14.899
We're together now.
That's all that matters.

05:15.525 --> 05:17.068
That's all that ever mattered, right?

05:17.610 --> 05:19.153
Ever since

05:20.196 --> 05:22.782
you were a little baby.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.577
My little Cobblepot.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.331
I'm sorry.

05:31.624 --> 05:33.084
This is my fault.

05:33.251 --> 05:36.462
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.007
For what?

05:39.507 --> 05:43.261
You were always such a good boy.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.102
Huh! No.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.321
Kill him. Dump the bodies

06:03.948 --> 06:05.199
anywhere.

06:07.827 --> 06:10.413
You don't have the stomach
to kill me yourself?

06:12.457 --> 06:14.667
No wonder your family was run out of town.

06:15.752 --> 06:18.629
You come from a long line of cowards!

06:23.301 --> 06:24.510
Fine, fine.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.520
Any last words?

06:35.146 --> 06:36.314
Yes.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.525
I am going to kill you.

06:39.984 --> 06:42.278
Oh, God!

06:54.749 --> 06:57.043
<i>You are a psychopath!</i>

06:57.210 --> 07:01.380
I am not the man that you think I am.
I would never do anything to hurt you.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.766
<i>Rise and shine.</i>

07:14.018 --> 07:15.603
What are you doing here?

07:16.771 --> 07:18.022
I banished you for good.

07:18.189 --> 07:20.650
Almost. Love of a good woman and all that.

07:21.150 --> 07:24.612
Though we both know
how that turned out. Yikes!

07:26.489 --> 07:28.199
That was an accident.

07:29.117 --> 07:30.326
I'm not that man.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.246
I'm gonna make this right.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.206
See, I knew you'd wake up all boo-hooey.

07:35.373 --> 07:37.250
<i>You probably have half a mind
to turn yourself in.</i>

07:37.416 --> 07:39.085
Luckily, I have the other half.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.547
- Do you like magic tricks?
- What?

07:42.713 --> 07:45.049
Of course you like magic tricks.
After all, I do.

07:45.216 --> 07:48.511
Well, guess what.
I can make a body disappear.

07:59.564 --> 08:01.190
Where is she?

08:03.317 --> 08:05.153
Where is Miss Kringle's body?

08:05.403 --> 08:07.071
Open the envelope.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.494
<i>"I hid her body
while you were catching some Z's.</i>

08:13.703 --> 08:15.413
"You'll need a helping hand,

08:15.580 --> 08:19.000
"so look for her initials
down at the G.C.P.D."

08:22.628 --> 08:24.172
You went to my work last night?

08:24.338 --> 08:25.798
Well, technically, you did.

08:26.591 --> 08:28.467
I was just in the driver's seat,
so to speak.

08:28.634 --> 08:32.263
How? You're a figment of my imagination.

08:32.930 --> 08:35.474
A projection of impulse. Nothing more!

08:36.100 --> 08:37.310
That is uncalled for.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.395
Uncalled for?

08:40.396 --> 08:45.651
You hijacked my body while I was asleep,
and you stole my dead girlfriend!

08:45.818 --> 08:51.199
Okay. Yeah, it's true.
But I'm doing this for your own good.

08:51.991 --> 08:55.661
If I was you, which, again, I sort of am,
I'd get cracking.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.538
You do want to find the body first, right?

08:59.373 --> 09:00.917
<i>Reporting live from City Hall</i>

09:01.083 --> 09:02.627
<i>as we celebrate
the latest mayoral election.</i>

09:02.793 --> 09:05.004
<i>Early exit point confirmed that
Gotham City's new mayor</i>

09:05.171 --> 09:08.925
<i>will be Theo Galavan,
who is projected to win in a landslide,</i>

09:09.091 --> 09:11.010
<i>helped by the endorsement
of many prominent citizens,</i>

09:11.219 --> 09:13.763
<i>including Police Union President
James Gordon,</i>

09:13.930 --> 09:15.806
<i>City Comptroller Edwin--</i>

09:16.599 --> 09:19.101
I can't believe you're going to be
mayor of this sinkhole.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.646
Can I go to the victory party tonight?

09:21.812 --> 09:23.439
You promised me fun.

09:24.315 --> 09:26.317
When are we gonna unleash a little hell?

09:27.401 --> 09:30.821
There will be plenty of time
for unleashing hell and parties,

09:30.988 --> 09:34.158
once Bruce Wayne
has signed over his company

09:34.325 --> 09:37.578
and met his unfortunate destiny.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.582
Until then, I need focus.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.379
Young Bruce has become fond of you.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.923
His trust will be crucial
when the time comes.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.967
I need you to ensure

09:51.133 --> 09:55.054
that no one else is whispering in his ear
until I make my offer.

09:55.805 --> 09:57.348
See this finger?

09:57.890 --> 10:00.726
I've got little Bruce
wrapped tight around it.

10:01.394 --> 10:03.354
What a vixen you've become!

10:05.022 --> 10:07.650
You make me very proud.

10:07.817 --> 10:10.528
And we have Penguin to deal with.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.155
- I'm on it.
<i>- No.</i>

10:13.698 --> 10:17.743
I'm about to become mayor.
I'm gonna have an army at my disposal.

10:18.536 --> 10:19.996
Time to use it.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.584
Looks like you backed
the right horse. You trust him?

10:25.751 --> 10:29.255
A Gotham politician?
About as far as I can throw him.

10:29.422 --> 10:32.925
But if he gives the G.C.P.D.
what it needs, he's all right by me.

10:34.051 --> 10:38.180
You know, Selina said Penguin was behind
the Wayne Enterprise fires.

10:38.389 --> 10:39.432
So?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.392
So first he's going
after mayoral candidates,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.311
next thing you know,
he's burning down buildings?

10:43.477 --> 10:44.562
It doesn't make any sense.

10:44.729 --> 10:48.149
Guy's an abacus of crazy.
Nothing he does surprises me.

10:54.697 --> 10:55.906
What the hell happened?

10:56.157 --> 10:59.160
Penguin. He tried to kill our next mayor.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.376
Mr. Cobblepot knew that
I was poised to win the election today,

11:07.543 --> 11:09.920
and he came to me seeking an alliance.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.881
And you refused.

11:12.173 --> 11:15.217
I politely declined, yes.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.844
So he stabbed you in the neck?

11:17.011 --> 11:20.264
That seems like a pretty extreme reaction,
even for Penguin.

11:20.473 --> 11:23.768
We've been trying to build a case
against Penguin since I got here.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.020
We assume that he's behind
the earlier attacks

11:26.187 --> 11:27.688
on the other candidates as well.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.274
And this is the second time
he's tried to kill me.

11:30.441 --> 11:31.609
The man is a menace.

11:31.776 --> 11:34.612
And one that I fully intend
to put behind bars.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.364
I assume you have something for me.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.325
Arrest warrant for Oswald Cobblepot,

11:39.575 --> 11:43.829
as well as search and seizures on
all his properties and known associates.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.499
Quite a list. We'll get right on it.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.334
- Anything else?
- Yes.

11:48.501 --> 11:51.921
In light of recent events, Judge Turnball
has declared a state of emergency

11:52.088 --> 11:54.548
and granted the Mayor's office
additional powers.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.008
Meaning what exactly?

11:56.175 --> 11:59.220
The moment I'm sworn in,
I'm implementing a curfew,

11:59.387 --> 12:02.348
and I'm ordering your strike force
to begin door-to-door searches

12:02.556 --> 12:05.643
until Mr. Cobblepot is apprehended.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.396
You're talking about martial law?

12:09.021 --> 12:12.691
We're talking about bringing
a dangerous fugitive to justice.

12:12.858 --> 12:16.529
We'll be acting within our legal rights.
Am I right, Mr. Dent?

12:16.695 --> 12:17.947
Absolutely.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.741
You'll have our full support, sir.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.159
Thank you, Captain.

12:22.368 --> 12:23.828
Captain Barnes.

12:25.496 --> 12:27.164
Detective Gordon.

12:27.832 --> 12:30.584
You seem hesitant.

12:31.252 --> 12:32.503
Cautious.

12:33.421 --> 12:37.466
You told me we needed to use
every method at our disposal

12:37.633 --> 12:39.135
to go after men like Penguin.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.011
Men who don't play by the rules.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.055
Desperate times call for a strong measure.

12:43.222 --> 12:46.183
I have no problem going after Penguin
with everything we've got,

12:46.350 --> 12:48.686
but if we start kicking down the doors
of average citizens

12:48.853 --> 12:51.564
and policing through fear,
we're no better than he is.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.858
People still need to trust us.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.276
And they will.

12:55.443 --> 12:59.864
Because at the end of the day,
all people want is to feel safe.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.368
Just remember, Detective,

13:05.411 --> 13:06.620
you came to me.

13:10.583 --> 13:11.750
<i>Congrats, Mr. Mayor.</i>

13:20.259 --> 13:23.304
<i>It is official.
Theo Galavan will be the Mayor of Gotham.</i>

13:23.471 --> 13:26.390
<i>A crowd has gathered outside,
and the excitement is brimming.</i>

13:26.557 --> 13:29.268
<i>And in just a moment, we'll also
be talking to many of the supporters</i>

13:29.477 --> 13:31.937
<i>that gave up their time and effort
to support--</i>

13:35.566 --> 13:38.068
- What do you have against the front door?
- Nothing.

13:38.694 --> 13:42.156
It's the ape who opens it
who I could live without.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.326
I haven't seen you in a month.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.536
Selina, what are you doing here?

13:47.745 --> 13:49.914
You wouldn't believe the week I've had.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.083
This friend of mine, Bridgit,
decided to build this fire suit.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.544
- Selina.
- Some people just don't...

13:57.838 --> 13:59.131
Whose is that?

13:59.298 --> 14:01.342
Sorry. I got lost on the way back from...

14:03.552 --> 14:04.678
Hello.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.181
Hi.

14:09.099 --> 14:12.520
Silver St. Cloud,
this is my friend, Selina.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.523
Selina, this is Silver.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.857
Nice to meet you.

14:17.775 --> 14:18.984
You too.

14:19.944 --> 14:21.570
Are you staying for lunch?

14:21.779 --> 14:23.030
- No.
- Please say you are.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.866
I just moved here
and don't know many people.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.953
Bruce, go tell Alfred
to set another place for lunch.

14:29.245 --> 14:32.122
Come on, it'll be fun! Go, shoo.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.591
While it's just us girls,

14:43.259 --> 14:45.302
let me give you a little advice.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.889
You come around here again,

14:50.307 --> 14:52.142
well, that would be bad

14:53.519 --> 14:55.437
for you.

14:56.689 --> 14:58.107
Who the hell are you?

14:58.274 --> 14:59.858
I'm Bruce's friend.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.070
His only friend.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.911
And you're a piece of gutter trash.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.247
Now tell me something.

15:13.414 --> 15:16.959
Would anyone miss you
if, one day, you were just

15:17.793 --> 15:18.919
gone?

15:21.338 --> 15:22.881
I didn't think so.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.217
<i>I told Alfred.</i>

15:28.470 --> 15:30.264
What are you guys talking about?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.141
Nothing.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.351
Just girl stuff.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.398
<i>"You'll need a helping hand."</i>

15:40.024 --> 15:42.234
<i>"Look for her initials
down at the G.C.P.D."</i>

15:43.110 --> 15:45.195
<i>"Look for her initials
down at the G.C.P.D."</i>

15:47.364 --> 15:49.950
"Look for her initials
down at the G.C.P.D."

15:50.117 --> 15:51.619
Kristen Kringle, "K.K."

15:51.785 --> 15:53.829
K.K., K.K.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.006
<i>No!</i>

16:47.132 --> 16:48.258
Come on!

16:49.802 --> 16:52.096
<i>Hey, Mike,
can you give me a hand with this?</i>

16:52.262 --> 16:53.555
<i>It's really heavy.</i>

17:05.442 --> 17:09.279
Putting Penguin in the crosshairs of
the G.C.P.D. will drive him underground.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.990
We can't kill him if we can't find him.

17:12.199 --> 17:16.161
We won't have to find him.
He's going to deliver himself to us.

17:16.412 --> 17:18.122
And why would he do that?

17:18.997 --> 17:22.626
Penguin's rage
will consume his better judgment,

17:22.793 --> 17:26.463
leaving him with an insatiable craving
for revenge.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.508
All we have to do is keep him hungry

17:30.259 --> 17:31.969
and then invite him to dinner.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.098
And then I get to kill him.

17:36.265 --> 17:37.725
Yes, kitten.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.729
Then you get to kill him.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.902
<i>I'm eager to get to work.</i>

17:49.069 --> 17:51.488
<i>I'd also like to address
the recent attempt on my life</i>

17:51.655 --> 17:53.574
<i>by the man known as Penguin.</i>

17:53.741 --> 17:57.995
<i>It is true that he attacked me,
and as of now, he is still at large.</i>

17:58.162 --> 18:01.039
<i>Men such as Penguin
will no longer be tolerated.</i>

18:01.206 --> 18:05.502
<i>These are men who scurry from
the light of decency like cockroaches.</i>

18:05.669 --> 18:09.506
<i>Men who not even a mother could love.</i>

18:20.100 --> 18:22.936
He dies. Tonight.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.196
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

18:32.362 --> 18:34.573
Gilzean's holed up
in a booze joint downtown.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.033
- Penguin?
<i>- Mmm-mmm.</i>

18:36.325 --> 18:39.578
And get this. Word on the street is
Gilzean's started his own crew.

18:39.787 --> 18:42.664
Sounds like they had a falling out.
Maybe he's ready to talk.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.041
Yeah.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.418
Hey. I heard about
what happened to our new mayor.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.545
- Never a dull moment, huh?
- No kidding.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.589
You left your keys again this morning.

18:50.964 --> 18:51.965
Oh.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.510
What's this one?

18:55.052 --> 18:56.553
A key to my apartment.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.515
- Oh.
- I'll be in the car.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.892
What? It's just a key.

19:02.601 --> 19:04.061
Yeah, I know. Uh...

19:04.853 --> 19:06.355
Do you want a key to my place?

19:06.522 --> 19:09.024
Not even a little bit.
Wait, do you have a place?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.359
I think so.

19:10.526 --> 19:13.153
Sorry, caught me off guard.
I guess I do spend most nights there.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.740
Which I love. What I don't love
is hauling ass out of bed at 2:00 a.m.

19:16.949 --> 19:19.743
when you come home from a stakeout
smelling of chili dogs.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.913
I love to watch you squirm.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.665
I was not squirming.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.166
A little squirm.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.007
I had no idea we were entertaining today,
Master Bruce.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.219
Anyone else popping by?

19:37.386 --> 19:39.012
<i>No. Thank you, Alfred.</i>

19:39.721 --> 19:41.139
This is marvelous, Alfred.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.309
I fell in love with Lapsang Souchong
when I lived in Fujian.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.936
Driving through the Wuyi region,

19:46.103 --> 19:48.313
all you could smell is the burning cedar
they use to smoke leaves.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.859
Right. Well, technically,
it's, uh, pinewood, Miss,

19:52.025 --> 19:53.944
but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

19:57.823 --> 20:01.285
That smell really does slap you
in the face, doesn't it, Alfred?

20:04.413 --> 20:05.664
So, Selina,

20:06.456 --> 20:07.624
<i>tell me about yourself.</i>

20:08.083 --> 20:09.459
Any family?

20:10.419 --> 20:12.212
You really buying her act?

20:13.422 --> 20:14.631
I beg your pardon?

20:16.174 --> 20:18.135
Let me ask you a question.

20:19.511 --> 20:22.222
- How long have you been a two-faced slut?
- Selina!

20:22.389 --> 20:23.974
No, seriously, what are you after?

20:24.683 --> 20:27.769
It's the money, right?
I mean, it's not his wacky sense of humor.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.897
- I think I should go.
- No, wait.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.356
Is that a tear?

20:33.025 --> 20:34.318
You're good.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.112
I'm sorry. Goodbye, Bruce.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.239
Silver.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.618
What did you just do?

20:43.535 --> 20:47.289
I know you're not the best judge
of, like, you know, people,

20:47.456 --> 20:49.666
but that girl is bad news.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.543
I just did you a favor.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.171
I want you to leave.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.468
Fine. Whatever.

20:59.635 --> 21:00.719
Maybe you're right.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.848
Maybe I'm not the best judge of people.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.437
Because all this time,
I thought you were my friend,

21:12.230 --> 21:14.816
but clearly you have no idea
what that means.

21:38.799 --> 21:41.343
"I'm tired of hiding
and want to be free.

21:41.510 --> 21:45.305
"To locate her body,
find the two things missing from me."

21:46.056 --> 21:49.726
Back of her head kind of looks funny.
It's like the top of a pencil.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.396
Why are you doing this?

21:52.562 --> 21:57.067
Because it's fun! And it's good for you.

21:57.234 --> 22:01.530
How is it good for me to be tortured,
to be driven insane?

22:01.697 --> 22:06.368
I'm trying to show you who you are.
How have you not realized that yet?

22:06.535 --> 22:11.289
Though, to be honest, I'm surprised
you haven't figured out this riddle yet.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.749
Should I have made it easier?

22:12.916 --> 22:14.626
You could start by using proper grammar.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.462
A period at the end of a sentence is...

22:19.589 --> 22:20.716
<i>M,</i> period, <i>E,</i> period.

22:20.882 --> 22:24.219
Oh, God! M.E., medical examiner.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.096
You didn't!

22:26.263 --> 22:27.597
I did.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.153
I say we wait and see
if someone can walk us inside,

22:41.319 --> 22:43.030
<i>try and keep things civil.</i>

22:46.199 --> 22:49.036
Did I tell you
I was thinking about getting a cat?

22:50.454 --> 22:51.455
What?

22:51.621 --> 22:55.083
Hey, how are you? Why don't you
get your head in the game here?

22:55.250 --> 22:56.334
I'm sorry.

22:56.793 --> 22:57.919
It's just...

22:59.046 --> 23:00.797
Do you believe Galavan's story?

23:00.964 --> 23:04.760
Questions like that are above my pay grade
and below my sense of wonder.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.094
Penguin's a pragmatist.

23:06.261 --> 23:10.223
Hitting Galavan for refusing an alliance,
that doesn't get him anything but heat.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.392
So what really happened, do you think?

23:12.934 --> 23:15.645
A few months ago,
nobody knew who Galavan was, right?

23:15.854 --> 23:17.647
Now all of a sudden, he's mayor?

23:17.856 --> 23:22.110
Doesn't happen by accident.
It takes planning and it takes help.

23:22.277 --> 23:26.448
Guys like Galavan are born on third base.
Stealing home is practically a birthright.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.325
Think about the timing.

23:28.492 --> 23:32.162
He shows up
just after Mayor James disappears.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.791
A massacre at the gala
turns him into a hero.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.835
Penguin's assassination attempts
on mayoral candidates

23:39.002 --> 23:41.421
launched his campaign.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.341
Everything that's gone down
up to this point,

23:44.508 --> 23:46.384
you could argue was orchestrated.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.596
Look, what you're talking about
is Machiavellian-level crazy,

23:49.763 --> 23:51.848
even by Gotham's standards.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.225
Yeah.

23:57.562 --> 23:58.897
Here's our door pass.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.861
<i>Yeah, so your mother tells you.</i>

24:05.028 --> 24:07.906
Yeah, his mama
stopped talking to me ages ago.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.157
Oh, finally!

24:11.701 --> 24:13.995
- Hey, hey!
- I wouldn't.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.039
Oh, come on!

24:16.206 --> 24:17.541
I really wouldn't.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.046
That's a lot of firepower there, Butch.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.882
You expecting company?

24:26.049 --> 24:27.926
Neighborhood ain't
what it used to be, Jim.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.219
Where's Penguin?

24:30.137 --> 24:31.304
How should I know?

24:31.555 --> 24:34.099
You're the boss's lapdog
and you don't know where your owner is?

24:35.058 --> 24:37.561
I ain't nobody's lapdog, not anymore.

24:37.727 --> 24:38.895
Prove it.

24:39.062 --> 24:41.398
Tell us why the hell
Penguin went after Galavan.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.567
I ain't telling you anything.

24:43.733 --> 24:47.028
And unless you have a warrant,
I'm gonna have to ask you boys to leave.

24:47.195 --> 24:51.741
Yeah, see, the thing is our newly elected
mayor kind of wants results on this.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.828
So we drag you in, chances are,
that's where you're gonna stay.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.914
<i>I'm here for Gilzean.</i>

25:01.418 --> 25:04.588
Anyone who leaves now, leaves alive.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.426
<i>Any who stays, dies.</i>

25:10.677 --> 25:13.805
<i>You have 60 seconds to do the math.</i>

25:13.972 --> 25:15.307
Sorry, Butch.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.186
Seriously?

25:20.103 --> 25:22.105
No honor among scumbags, huh?

25:22.272 --> 25:24.232
Hey, don't shoot. I'm out of here.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.492
What are you doing?

25:35.285 --> 25:37.287
You tell us what the hell
is going on with Penguin,

25:37.454 --> 25:38.788
or we leave you with Zsasz.

25:38.955 --> 25:39.956
You can't do that.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.167
- Bullock?
- We can totally do that!

25:44.294 --> 25:45.921
Galavan was telling Penguin what to do.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.089
Knocking off the candidates,
torching the buildings,

25:48.256 --> 25:49.674
it all came down from Galavan.

25:49.841 --> 25:51.468
Why the hell was Penguin taking orders?

25:51.635 --> 25:53.803
Kidnapped Penguin's mother.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.972
- He was keeping her for leverage.
- Kidnapped?

25:57.682 --> 26:00.060
Jim? I think we need to go.

26:00.227 --> 26:02.479
I didn't think Galavan
would actually go through with it...

26:02.646 --> 26:05.774
Go through with what?
Go through with what?

26:10.570 --> 26:13.740
G.C.P.D.! Put down your weapons!

26:29.339 --> 26:31.675
We're outmanned here big time, partner.

26:32.175 --> 26:34.844
Yeah. But not outgunned.

26:35.679 --> 26:36.721
Oh, hell yeah!

26:58.493 --> 27:02.038
<i>I'll take that as a no.
See you later, Butch.</i>

27:09.921 --> 27:11.506
That's a new one.

27:13.174 --> 27:15.385
You think he was telling the truth?

27:15.552 --> 27:17.637
Nobody's telling the truth.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.389
This is Gotham.

27:28.648 --> 27:29.816
Bruce.

27:30.442 --> 27:32.235
What a lovely surprise!

27:33.528 --> 27:36.281
Hello, sir. I was looking for Silver.

27:37.032 --> 27:38.408
She's here.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.910
Seemed a bit upset when she came in.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.495
Yes, sir.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.790
A friend of mine stopped by the house
while Silver was there. They--

27:45.957 --> 27:48.918
Say no more. I was your age once.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.754
Your feelings do you credit.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.963
I never met your father,

27:52.130 --> 27:55.675
but it's clear that he instilled in you
a sound moral compass.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.761
He did.

28:00.263 --> 28:03.308
You know, we're both very alike.

28:04.392 --> 28:10.106
Born into wealth and privilege,
yet forced to walk our lives alone.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.901
Haunted by loss.

28:13.109 --> 28:16.905
<i>Driven to prove ourselves worthy
of those who came before.</i>

28:19.366 --> 28:21.159
Be careful, Bruce.

28:21.326 --> 28:24.871
That way of thinking,
the need to fill the void,

28:25.538 --> 28:26.915
it can consume you.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.958
Does it ever go away?

28:29.125 --> 28:31.211
No, but

28:31.795 --> 28:35.924
you can find closure,
a way to move on without letting go.

28:36.591 --> 28:37.592
How?

28:37.759 --> 28:40.762
Well,
I don't want to make any promises,

28:40.929 --> 28:43.807
but when the time is right,
we'll talk again.

28:49.437 --> 28:52.816
I, uh, need to get ready for the party.
Excuse me.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.321
I knew you'd come.

29:06.079 --> 29:10.083
No one is to kill Galavan but me.
Understand?

29:10.250 --> 29:11.626
Boss, I got what you're feeling.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.921
A mother's love, it's the most beautiful,
most simple--

29:15.088 --> 29:16.172
Gabe!

29:16.714 --> 29:19.759
Cops aren't gonna let you
within 100 feet of Galavan.

29:19.968 --> 29:22.720
Let us whack him for you. Please?

29:22.929 --> 29:24.180
No.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.141
He's mine.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.521
Now, let's get dressed.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.691
We've got a party to attend.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.235
Listen up, people!

29:39.320 --> 29:43.366
Our newly elected mayor is going ahead
with his victory celebration tonight.

29:44.492 --> 29:48.246
He will be exposed, he will be vulnerable

29:48.830 --> 29:52.333
and he will be protected by you,

29:52.876 --> 29:55.587
the brave men and women
of this police force.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.423
You all have your assignments.

29:58.590 --> 30:02.218
Detective Gordon here
will be running point. Detective.

30:05.013 --> 30:08.892
Penguin has already made one attempt
on Galavan's life today.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.894
We should be ready for anything.

30:11.686 --> 30:15.064
Let's show this city
what it means to carry a badge.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.566
As you were!

30:27.285 --> 30:29.746
I want check-ins from perimeter teams
every five minutes.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.040
Martinez, how's the Avenue looking?

30:32.207 --> 30:36.669
All clear. Sniper teams
alpha and bravo report all clear as well.

30:37.295 --> 30:38.630
Copy that.

30:39.422 --> 30:40.632
What'd you find out?

30:40.798 --> 30:43.092
Spoke to the super
at Gertrude Kapelput's building.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.595
Turns out, no one has seen her
for two weeks.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.597
Timeline matches Gilzean's story.

30:48.264 --> 30:51.518
Maybe, or maybe the old broad's
on a sunset cruise. Hmm?

30:52.644 --> 30:55.772
You know, there's something
that Gilzean said that I can't shake.

30:55.939 --> 30:57.982
He said he never thought
Galavan would go through with it.

30:58.149 --> 30:59.275
Go through with what?

31:00.109 --> 31:02.987
I don't think Gertrude Kapelput
is on a cruise.

31:03.154 --> 31:05.114
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:06.115 --> 31:09.869
let me be the first
to officially introduce you

31:10.036 --> 31:13.790
to the Honorable Theo Galavan,

31:13.957 --> 31:15.917
the new mayor of Gotham!

32:11.014 --> 32:12.056
Ed.

32:12.265 --> 32:13.558
Oh, my...

32:13.725 --> 32:15.018
What are you doing?

32:16.311 --> 32:17.979
Dr. Thompkins. Hello.

32:18.187 --> 32:19.188
Uh...

32:19.439 --> 32:23.484
I'm just double-checking notes
for a Jane Doe case I'm working.

32:23.651 --> 32:24.736
Do you need help?

32:24.902 --> 32:27.113
No. No, no, no. She's all gone.
Uh, she's...

32:27.280 --> 32:31.534
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm all done with checking my notes.

32:31.701 --> 32:33.369
Uh, what notes?

32:36.164 --> 32:37.790
It's all up here.

32:38.041 --> 32:41.711
Do you realize that by assigning
simple mnemonic devices to case files,

32:41.878 --> 32:43.421
you can produce recall capacity

32:43.588 --> 32:46.215
equal to that of photographic
or even eidetic memory?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.302
- Ed, what's going on?
- Okay.

32:49.469 --> 32:50.553
Sorry.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.056
Um, truth be told,

32:54.724 --> 32:57.560
uh, I was hoping
to run into you here. Alone.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.729
It's Miss Kringle.

33:00.396 --> 33:03.232
Just...
We had a fight.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.445
I'm sorry.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.741
Every relationship
hits a rough patch now and then.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.577
And you've been so supportive.

33:14.827 --> 33:17.705
And I was hoping that maybe
we could go grab a coffee,

33:17.872 --> 33:19.290
and you could give me some advice.

33:19.457 --> 33:21.334
Do you want to finish up
what you were doing first?

33:21.501 --> 33:24.045
No, no, no.
No, I can come back another time.

33:24.212 --> 33:26.381
It's not like they're gonna
go anywhere, right?

33:26.547 --> 33:27.548
You'd think so.

33:27.715 --> 33:29.092
Yeah, okay.

33:38.184 --> 33:39.936
Detective Gordon.

33:40.103 --> 33:42.313
<i>Okay. That's it, sir. Perfect.</i>

33:42.522 --> 33:43.564
Thank you so much.

33:44.607 --> 33:47.527
I, uh, heard about your shootout today.

33:47.735 --> 33:51.572
Something about one of Penguin's
former lieutenants. A Butch Gilzean?

33:51.739 --> 33:54.617
Some men ambushed us
as we were questioning him.

33:54.784 --> 33:55.952
He escaped.

33:56.869 --> 34:00.123
Did you get anything out of him
before the attack?

34:01.624 --> 34:02.709
No.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.128
It's a pity.

34:07.463 --> 34:08.464
Well.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.885
<i>Mr. Mayor!</i>

34:15.763 --> 34:17.682
<i>Detective,
I have a large group of men</i>

34:17.849 --> 34:19.517
approaching from off the main road.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.238
I have eyes on the target.
Appears to be Cobblepot, sir.

34:32.447 --> 34:35.783
Hold your fire.
Perimeter units, prepare to engage.

34:39.328 --> 34:40.329
The target is down!

34:40.496 --> 34:42.331
Martinez, I said, "Hold your fire!"

34:42.498 --> 34:43.583
<i>It wasn't us.</i>

34:44.167 --> 34:45.668
We have an unknown shooter on the roof.

34:45.835 --> 34:48.588
<i>I repeat, we have an unknown shooter
on the roof.</i>

35:00.558 --> 35:02.727
Martinez, is Penguin dead?

35:06.606 --> 35:07.774
No. It wasn't him.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.401
Find the other shooter and find Penguin!
We need him alive!

35:13.279 --> 35:15.573
<i>Detective,
all the targets are dressed as Penguin,</i>

35:15.740 --> 35:18.284
and all are heavily armed.
Positive ID is impossible.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.456
Martinez, you're clear to engage.

35:23.623 --> 35:25.958
All perimeter units,
crash our location now.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.738
Drop it.

35:56.531 --> 35:59.283
Turn around. Hands above your head. Now.

36:01.702 --> 36:03.162
So forceful.

36:03.955 --> 36:06.207
I like a strong, confident man.

36:26.435 --> 36:27.436
<i>Help!</i>

36:29.772 --> 36:31.232
Oh, my God!

36:32.650 --> 36:33.860
We got to get you out of here.

36:34.026 --> 36:36.821
Radio his driver. Have him pull the car
around to the back service entrance.

36:36.988 --> 36:37.989
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

36:38.155 --> 36:39.782
- Cover us?
- No problem.

36:49.041 --> 36:52.295
<i>Remaining
officers, stay inside and clear the lobby.</i>

36:52.461 --> 36:54.630
<i>Confirmed. Primary is on the move.</i>

36:54.797 --> 36:56.799
<i>Initiating exit plan
near the south entrance.</i>

36:56.966 --> 36:59.468
<i>Roger that. Detective Gordon is en route</i>

36:59.635 --> 37:01.220
<i>to the rear entrance with the Mayor.</i>

37:01.387 --> 37:04.140
<i>Need their limo
at the back service entrance, stat.</i>

37:04.807 --> 37:06.392
<i>Copy that.</i>

37:10.605 --> 37:12.023
Get him out of here!

37:15.985 --> 37:16.986
Down!

37:20.573 --> 37:21.782
Hello, Jim.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.328
Please step aside.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.330
You know I can't do that.

37:27.580 --> 37:30.124
You would if you knew
what kind of man you were protecting.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.959
Shoot him, Detective.

37:32.126 --> 37:36.505
Oswald, listen to me.
You have to put the gun down!

37:38.424 --> 37:40.468
He killed my mother, Jim.

37:41.469 --> 37:42.678
I know.

37:44.013 --> 37:49.852
Detective Gordon, I am ordering you
to put that man down now!

37:50.061 --> 37:52.396
He had her murdered in front of me.

37:53.856 --> 37:56.776
I held her, watched her die.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.862
Do you know what that's like?

38:00.863 --> 38:02.615
It changes a person.

38:02.823 --> 38:04.325
<i>I'm sorry
about your mother, Penguin,</i>

38:04.492 --> 38:09.038
but I'm gonna need you to put the
shotgun down on the ground slowly. Now.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.752
One of us is going to die tonight.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.796
<i>I have made my peace with that.</i>

38:17.004 --> 38:20.091
I suggest the new mayor does as well.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.259
Don't make us shoot you.

38:22.426 --> 38:25.054
Shoot me, and you have no idea
what his endgame is, Jim!

38:26.013 --> 38:29.934
And you should,
because it concerns someone you know,

38:30.101 --> 38:32.186
someone you care about.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.146
Shoot him.

38:35.564 --> 38:36.607
Duck!

38:48.285 --> 38:49.954
Jim! Oswald!

39:04.802 --> 39:07.179
Penguin smashed the Mayor's ride
through the main checkpoint.

39:07.346 --> 39:10.516
The good news is, with the gunshot wound
to the shoulder and the APB,

39:10.683 --> 39:12.101
I doubt he'll make it out of the city.

39:12.268 --> 39:14.061
He won't be trying to make it out.

39:15.521 --> 39:20.234
We lost more people tonight, good people,
including Martinez.

39:20.443 --> 39:22.820
Sometimes, the good guys have a bad night.

39:22.987 --> 39:24.280
This ain't your fault.

39:24.488 --> 39:25.740
I know.

39:27.158 --> 39:28.492
It's his.

39:30.286 --> 39:33.205
My ancestors were swordsmiths.

39:33.414 --> 39:38.419
They knew that to make good steel,
it had first to be forged.

39:39.587 --> 39:41.505
I look at tonight...

39:42.798 --> 39:46.635
<i>I look at tonight as a baptism of fire.</i>

39:46.969 --> 39:50.097
<i>A fire from which we will emerge stronger.</i>

39:50.264 --> 39:56.312
<i>Our resolve forged
to bring about a new day in Gotham!</i>

40:01.442 --> 40:03.652
I've felt pretty alone since moving here.

40:05.738 --> 40:06.989
Until I met you.

40:08.407 --> 40:12.119
But I don't want to come
between you and a friend.

40:12.912 --> 40:14.038
You won't.

40:14.205 --> 40:16.207
Selina is never going to like me.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.168
I don't care.

40:21.587 --> 40:22.838
I like you.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.564
- Detective Gordon.
- Mr. Mayor.

40:41.857 --> 40:43.109
You catch my speech?

40:43.275 --> 40:45.111
I think I've heard enough speeches.

40:46.362 --> 40:48.322
I had high hopes for you.

40:49.657 --> 40:52.284
I thought you were prepared
to make the hard choices,

40:52.451 --> 40:56.539
to do whatever it takes
to rid Gotham of its monsters.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.874
I am.

40:59.959 --> 41:01.710
I've just decided

41:03.129 --> 41:04.713
I'm going to start with you.

41:09.218 --> 41:11.178
Dangerous words

41:11.387 --> 41:15.141
when addressing the man
who now controls this city.

41:19.019 --> 41:20.563
Desperate times.

41:22.022 --> 41:23.732
They are indeed.

41:56.265 --> 41:58.350
I want to know why you did this.

41:58.684 --> 42:02.646
When Dr. Thompkins walked in the room,
how did it feel?

42:03.314 --> 42:05.941
I was terrified.
She could have discovered the body.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.776
But she didn't.

42:08.527 --> 42:09.945
You got away with it.

42:10.446 --> 42:11.780
That's not the point!

42:11.947 --> 42:14.700
That is absolutely the point!

42:16.619 --> 42:19.455
You can still feel the rush, can't you?

42:20.122 --> 42:22.458
Coming so close to getting caught.

42:23.292 --> 42:25.669
Knowing what you
would have been forced to do

42:25.836 --> 42:28.130
if she had discovered the body

42:28.297 --> 42:30.841
discovered what you had done.

42:31.008 --> 42:33.719
The pulse of that moment.

42:34.220 --> 42:38.641
Standing at the edge of uncertainty
and peering into the void.

42:38.807 --> 42:43.145
Now tell me. How did it feel?

42:52.863 --> 42:54.198
Beautiful.

44:04.810 --> 44:05.811
English - SDH
