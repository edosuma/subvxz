00:01.600 --> 00:03.420
NARRATOR: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.470 --> 00:04.619
She's getting dressed.
How is she?

00:07.470 --> 00:10.234
Question is who buried Ali's mom
in Spencer's baclqard?

00:10.270 --> 00:11.305
I think you need
to look at this.

00:11.340 --> 00:12.238
Jason actually told you

00:12.280 --> 00:13.770
that you shouldn't trust
your own father?

00:13.810 --> 00:16.278
He made i_t_seem like Mrs. D
was writing to my dad,

00:16.310 --> 00:17.402
"I can't protect you
anymore."

00:17.450 --> 00:19.372
We're clone fighting.
Which makes us what?

00:19.420 --> 00:20.409
Maybe we'll be friends.

00:20.450 --> 00:22.543
The truth will bury you
in a New York minute.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.648
I sent that text.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.442
I don't have to hide,
you do.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.412
And you're gonna
wish you stayed dead.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.519
You made me dye my hair,
you made me wear her clothes,

00:29.560 --> 00:31.380
you made me walk
like her, talk like her.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.398
IfI hadn't given you
the All upgrade,

00:33.430 --> 00:34.419
where would you be?

00:34.460 --> 00:36.462
Not the same.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.660
It's time for a change.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.429
Exactly what is it
you want us to do?

00:39.470 --> 00:40.732
I want us
to stick together.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.829
The bigger we are,
the harder she falls.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.337
You don't have
to worry about Shana.

00:44.370 --> 00:45.667
She's dead,
because I'm responsible.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.337
What do you mean
"responsible"?

00:47.380 --> 00:48.802
I mean that I killed her.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.479
Stop. You don't need
to run anymore.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.477
'A' is gone.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.348
You hate it.

00:59.390 --> 01:00.857
No, I don't hate it.
I actually really like it.

01:00.890 --> 01:03.552
I'm just confused
why the sudden impulse.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.626
I wanted to be
spontaneous.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.218
Hanna,
you're not spontaneous.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.625
You make a Pinterest board

01:08.660 --> 01:10.218
before you change
your nail polish.

01:17.370 --> 01:18.359
What's wrong?

01:18.410 --> 01:19.434
Nothing.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.471
Hanna.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.347
This was Shana's.

01:25.380 --> 01:26.642
What?

01:28.380 --> 01:29.347
Let's just put it back.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.641
No, no, no.
Hold on a second.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.757
Oh my God,
look what she underlined.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.350
"It is a curious subject
whether hatred and love

01:37.390 --> 01:39.449
be not the same thing
at bottom.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.558
Eachleaves
the passmnate lover,

01:40.600 --> 01:43.125
or the no less passionate hater,
forlorn and desolate

01:43.170 --> 01:44.159
by the withdrawal
of his subject."

01:44.200 --> 01:46.862
Aria, it's probably
just a school assignment.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.460
No, this is about
All and Jenna and us.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.761
This is about being 'A.â€˜

01:50.810 --> 01:52.539
No, this is about
you trying to paw

01:52.580 --> 01:53.569
through Shana's things

01:53.610 --> 01:54.474
when you should be
trying to forget about her.

01:54.510 --> 01:56.478
Well, there might be
something in here.

01:56.510 --> 01:57.499
Just stop.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.340
Who's throwing out
The Scarlet Letter.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.711
I loved this book.

02:07.390 --> 02:08.379
Maybe you should
get it for Ali.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.149
Since she is planning
on coming back to school,

02:10.190 --> 02:12.556
she probably needs it
to catch up.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.749
She'll get her own copy.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.892
I'll take this one.

02:14.930 --> 02:17.660
Shana won't be needing it.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.191
She transferred back
to Georgia, right?

02:21.540 --> 02:22.507
I don't know.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.905
We barely
remember the girl.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.498
Who could blame you?

02:25.540 --> 02:28.634
People come and go
so quickly around here.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.671
Shana gone, Ali back.

02:30.710 --> 02:34.578
One girl checks out
and another one checks in.

02:34.620 --> 02:35.746
Nice hair.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.379
* Got a secret

02:43.430 --> 02:44.727
* Can you keep it?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.796
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:46.830 --> 02:49.526
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:49.570 --> 02:51.925
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:51.970 --> 02:53.858
* If I show you
then I know *

02:53.900 --> 02:56.664
* You won't tell
what I saId *

02:56.710 --> 02:59.406
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:59.440 --> 03:01.704
* If one of them is dead

03:04.710 --> 03:06.439
Hey.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.483
There's waffles
if you're hungry.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.441
What you got there?

03:10.490 --> 03:12.811
Clothes for Goodwill.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.885
Al, do you think
it's a good idea

03:14.920 --> 03:16.421
to hold off for a bit?

03:16.460 --> 03:17.882
I wouldn't want you
to give away

03:17.930 --> 03:20.592
something of your mom's
that you might regret later on.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.825
These aren't mom's.
They're mIne.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.565
I feel like
I needed a clean slate.

03:24.600 --> 03:29.606
Okay. But do you feel like
you're rushing this a bit?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.699
It might be nice to have
some familiar things.

03:31.740 --> 03:34.004
I've grown out of
this stuff already.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.905
I'm not the same person
I was 2 years ago.

03:35.940 --> 03:39.546
Oh, I need some things
before I go back to school.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.713
Notepads, a new backpack.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.240
School?

03:45.620 --> 03:48.851
I can't stay
in my room forever.

03:48.890 --> 03:49.788
It's not helping.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.923
And I need to go back
if I want to graduate

03:51.960 --> 03:53.029
before I'm 30.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.597
I want you to have
that fresh start

03:55.630 --> 03:57.393
that we're talking about.

03:57.430 --> 04:01.890
But I really don't see how
that's possible if we stay here.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.261
You want to move?

04:04.310 --> 04:06.608
No. No, I need my friends.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.608
Well, you'll still see them.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.677
The place I moved into
isn't that far away.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.268
Maybe the girls can come
and spend the summer.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.776
Dad.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.789
Please. Don't.

04:17.820 --> 04:21.381
I can't have my friends
taken away from me, too.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.688
It's like living in the middle
of a demolition site.

04:28.730 --> 04:30.425
They destroyed everything.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.359
Absolutely everything.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.834
Mom, did you sleep
down here last night?

04:35.870 --> 04:37.701
I wouldn't call it sleep.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.037
Every time
I closed my eyes

04:39.070 --> 04:40.469
I could hear
the scraping of the shovels.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.949
Do you remember
when you told me

04:45.980 --> 04:47.948
that Dad and Melissa
had been acting strange?

04:47.980 --> 04:48.947
Yes.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.379
Okay, well the other day

04:50.420 --> 04:51.648
Melissa tried
to tell me something,

04:51.690 --> 04:53.817
something important
and Dad stopped her.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.509
And I think that it has to do
with Ali's mom.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.686
Oh, Spencer...

04:56.730 --> 04:57.788
No, you know
something's wrong.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.821
Okay.
I can tell that you know.

04:59.860 --> 05:00.849
They're hiding something.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.094
I spoke to your sister.

05:02.130 --> 05:02.892
The only thing
that she's been hiding

05:02.930 --> 05:04.659
is getting back together
with Wren.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.826
That's why
she avoided Toby.

05:05.870 --> 05:06.837
She's keeping
other secrets.

05:06.870 --> 05:07.962
( footsteps approaching )

05:08.970 --> 05:09.959
Morning.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.345
What's the matter?

05:16.380 --> 05:18.541
Or should I say
what's the matter now?

05:18.580 --> 05:20.343
We were just
talking about Jessica.

05:20.380 --> 05:21.813
How upsetting it is.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.010
Of course, you're upset.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.813
We all are.

05:24.850 --> 05:26.681
How much longer
is our yard

05:26.720 --> 05:27.687
going to remain
a crime scene?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.950
They said they'd be done
by the end of the day.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.685
Try to relax about it.

05:31.730 --> 05:32.719
You too, Spence.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.594
Do you think
we could hire Toby

05:38.630 --> 05:41.633
this weekend to help us
replant the yard?

05:41.670 --> 05:43.763
Toby's on a job
aswmm.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.766
I don't think
we can do this by ourselves.

05:45.810 --> 05:46.970
Look, Mom,
I will find somebody to help.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.637
Can we please
just talk about this?

05:48.680 --> 05:49.749
No. No.

05:49.780 --> 05:50.747
I don't want
to talk about it.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.775
Our next door neighbor
was found murdered

05:53.820 --> 05:55.447
in our baclqard.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.483
Surreal doesn't even begin
to describe this experience.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.818
Let's just focus on
what we can control, okay?

06:02.960 --> 06:04.450
You're being naive.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.458
We can't just call
the thing off.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.558
Sure we can.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.458
Why are you suddenly
bugging out?

06:11.500 --> 06:12.467
I'm not.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.594
I'm just having
second thoughts.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.803
She was held
in a basement, okay?

06:18.840 --> 06:22.139
Alison was kidnapped
and blindfolded

06:22.180 --> 06:25.547
and I don't even want
to think about what else.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.047
Hasn't the universe
punished her enough?

06:27.080 --> 06:28.741
What we're doing
isn't punishment,

06:28.780 --> 06:30.145
it's a preventative
measure.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.680
That's semantics.

06:33.690 --> 06:36.659
I never thought
I'd say this,

06:36.690 --> 06:38.885
but I feel bad for her.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.693
It's hard to still see
All as the devil

06:40.730 --> 06:42.197
when she just escaped
from the hell.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.790
What if I told you
that her abduction story

06:44.830 --> 06:47.492
is just that, a story?

06:47.540 --> 06:48.893
No one would lie
about something lIke that.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.158
She did.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.700
And I can prove it.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.908
58 seconds?

06:55.940 --> 06:57.703
That's all?
It felt like I was flying.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.672
Yeah, your technique
is so much better though.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.813
Let's just keep working
on increasing your strength.

07:01.850 --> 07:02.680
You want
to meet up tomorrow?

07:02.720 --> 07:03.789
Yeah.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.844
I have to check
in with my family,

07:04.890 --> 07:06.687
but it should be cool.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.654
Oh, right.
It's Saturday.

07:08.690 --> 07:09.782
Do you need to--

07:09.830 --> 07:11.081
No, I can still make it.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.654
I'm pretty much
doing everything

07:12.700 --> 07:13.997
I_can _to avoid
spending time at home.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.520
What's going on?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.790
Besides my mom
giving me the third degree?

07:17.830 --> 07:19.991
Nothing.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.667
Ever since
my friend Ali came back

07:21.700 --> 07:23.804
all my mom does
is ask me questions.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.535
And when she's_not
asking me questions,

07:25.570 --> 07:27.800
she's staring at me,
waiting for me to talk.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.546
So I've started taking
extra long showers

07:29.580 --> 07:30.706
just to get away
from her.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.570
When the hot water
runs out, I'm screwed.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.818
It's kind of natural
though for her

07:36.850 --> 07:38.715
to have questions.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.479
I would never ask mine,

07:40.520 --> 07:42.727
but it doesn't mean
I don't have them.

07:44.760 --> 07:45.727
What time tomorrow?

07:45.760 --> 07:47.455
( phone ringing )

07:53.000 --> 07:55.036
Let's meet up
same time as today.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.238
Oh. Sorry.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.508
No problem.

08:08.950 --> 08:11.009
_ _It's_ better than _
Sitting In the cafeteria.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.017
Not really.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.711
We're still a freak show.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.853
Now we're just a freak show
in natural light.

08:15.890 --> 08:18.620
I feel like we're lobsters
in the tank at a restaurant.

08:18.660 --> 08:20.196
You know, the ones
that you stare at to see

08:20.230 --> 08:21.390
which one
you want to eat.

08:21.430 --> 08:25.127
And then you see the lobster
with like the chewed off claw

08:25.170 --> 08:26.592
and then
the rubber band is--

08:26.640 --> 08:28.892
Hanna, we're not lobsters.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.908
Relax.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.032
Hey.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.901
Hey.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.800
Oh, my God.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.545
Guys.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.877
She is seriously
freaking me out.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.615
She knows
that we were in New York.

08:43.650 --> 08:44.480
She threatened Ali.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.782
What if she knows
about Shana, too?

08:45.820 --> 08:47.151
Aria, look,
you need to take

08:47.190 --> 08:48.885
a psychological selfie
right now.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.820
You're letting your paranoia
get the better of you.

08:50.860 --> 08:51.952
Really?

08:51.990 --> 08:54.652
How do you know that all this
isn't all about Shana?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.827
Because it's not.
It's all about Ali.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.667
I've been fielding
questions about her all day.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.031
Yeah, me, too.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.163
Some people have been
nice about it, I guess.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.303
Some people
have been rude about it.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.364
This girl in PE.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.935
asked me if it was true
if Ali was fed raw meat.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.971
What did you say?
Nothing.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.841
I just bonked her over
the head with a dodge ball.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.711
( phones beeps )

09:12.750 --> 09:14.115
Oh, my God.

09:14.150 --> 09:16.209
It can't be.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.945
It isn't. It's Ali.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.709
This is intense.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.715
She's saying that
because there were no obvious

09:21.760 --> 09:23.318
signs of struggle,
they're gonna have to wait

09:23.360 --> 09:25.055
for_ the coroner's
toxrcology results

09:25.090 --> 09:26.955
to determine
her mom's cause of death.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.797
The cause of death?
It was murder. Duh.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.718
Maybe the cops think
that she was poisoned.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.988
How do they know
that she wasn't buried alive?

09:36.370 --> 09:37.962
We don't have
to pretend like

09:38.010 --> 09:39.363
she wasn't found
in my backyard.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.968
We know your family
had nothing to do

09:41.010 --> 09:42.671
with what happened
to Ali's mom, Spence.

09:42.710 --> 09:43.847
Of course not.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.075
I mean if they killed her,
they wouldn't make a bonehead

09:46.110 --> 09:48.271
move like burying her
in their own flowerbed.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.345
Hanna, it's not helping.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.880
Yes, it is.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.408
Hey.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.805
You hungry?

10:16.410 --> 10:17.604
Not really.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.884
I got another call
from Detective Holbrook today.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.047
They need you to come
in for that medical exam.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.282
What did you tell him?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.719
I was able to postpone it
before because of your mom,

10:32.760 --> 10:35.888
but we can't
put it off forever.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.436
I know it's difficult.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.948
But it's important.

10:50.980 --> 10:54.074
And I'm gonna be right there
on the other side of that door.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.012
Dad, I don't want to go.

10:59.050 --> 11:01.052
Dad, please don't make me.

11:01.090 --> 11:04.025
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.358
I haven't wanted
to push you to talk.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.949
But if you were...

11:12.130 --> 11:13.199
hurt...

11:14.870 --> 11:16.064
you need to tell someone.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.675
Nothing like
that happened, Dad.

11:29.220 --> 11:33.759
You know, I actually
do think I'm hungry.

11:35.490 --> 11:38.129
I'd love a sandwich.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.422
Coming right up.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.968
I know you said
you needed some new clothes.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.997
Are you holding up okay?

12:19.400 --> 12:20.367
I've been
thinking about you.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.038
Wondering
how you're doing.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.504
Definitely been better.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.508
Yeah. Well, I wanted
to check in, make sure--

12:26.540 --> 12:30.499
Oh, that I'm not popping pills
like breath mints.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.506
Well, I wasn't going
to quite put it like that.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.142
Yeah.
Well, nobody ever does.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.239
But people are running
out of euphemisms

12:36.280 --> 12:37.542
for a lot of things
around here.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.114
Okay.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.879
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.754
Andrew, wait.

12:46.090 --> 12:48.797
What are you doing
tomorrow?

12:48.830 --> 12:50.320
I have a feeling
you're about to tell me.

13:03.210 --> 13:05.349
* Deep in my heart
there's a fire burning *

13:05.380 --> 13:07.041
* I need you like a drug

13:07.080 --> 13:10.140
* Whoa-oh,
you keep me wanting *

13:10.190 --> 13:13.489
* Whoa-oh,
I've come undone *

13:13.520 --> 13:16.409
* Nights with you like
tunnel vision *

13:16.460 --> 13:18.018
* Racing through
the dark *

13:18.060 --> 13:21.029
* Whoa-oh,
heart beating faster *

13:21.060 --> 13:24.894
* Whoa-oh,
it tears me up *

13:24.930 --> 13:27.069
* Ooh ooh

13:31.140 --> 13:33.438
* Baby, let's take it
too far tonight *

13:33.480 --> 13:35.505
* You're my favorite high

13:41.620 --> 13:44.111
* Thinking I'm crossing
the line this time *

13:44.150 --> 13:46.141
* Taking me for a ride

14:08.140 --> 14:11.940
* I am weak

14:15.250 --> 14:19.141
* Jesus, keep me

14:19.190 --> 14:23.422
* From all wrong

14:23.460 --> 14:27.157
* I'll be satisfied

14:27.200 --> 14:34.163
* As long as I walk

14:35.600 --> 14:40.401
* Let me walk
close to Thee *

14:49.280 --> 14:50.281
( phone beeps )

14:54.290 --> 14:56.656
LUCAS: Long time, no see.

14:56.690 --> 14:58.123
Hey.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.048
So you're back
at Rosewood?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.523
Homeschooling
wasn't really for me.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.027
It's kind of
a game changer

15:04.070 --> 15:06.163
when your mom can ground you
and flunk you.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.129
I heard about Alison.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.329
It's kind of hard
to believe.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.541
What did you hear?

15:17.580 --> 15:21.038
That she escaped from whoever
it was that took her...

15:23.090 --> 15:24.648
that she's back
in Rosewood.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.681
Is she coming back
to school?

15:29.720 --> 15:30.687
I don't know.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.325
( phone ringing )

15:35.500 --> 15:37.058
Sorry.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.965
I have to take this.
It's Ali.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.161
No problem.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.189
I'll see you.

15:44.070 --> 15:45.162
Hey, Ali.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.006
ALI: ( on phone )
Where is everyone?

15:46.040 --> 15:47.576
You're the first person
to pick up.

15:47.610 --> 15:50.306
I'm going in for
medical exam tomorrow

15:50.350 --> 15:52.375
and I don't want
to go alone.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.311
Can you please
come with me?

15:55.350 --> 15:57.989
Yeah, sure.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.339
When should I pick you up?

16:11.300 --> 16:13.461
How's it going?
I'm just waiting for--

16:13.500 --> 16:15.229
I was just gonna say you're
doing a great job with Sydney.

16:15.270 --> 16:16.259
She's gotten a lot better.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.460
It's really
generous of you

16:17.510 --> 16:18.738
to work with her
on a weekend.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.375
Yeah, it's nice just
to hang out with someone

16:21.410 --> 16:25.369
who sees me more than just
a friend of dead-girl-walking.

16:25.410 --> 16:26.274
How is Ali?

16:26.310 --> 16:28.471
I don't know.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.342
It's hard to know
what to ask or what to say.

16:32.390 --> 16:33.687
So sorry I'm late.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.153
Hey, Paige.

16:35.190 --> 16:36.680
Hey.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.779
See you around.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.354
Do you want to join us?

16:40.400 --> 16:41.298
Yeah.
Come with us.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.797
We were going to do
sprints on the track.

16:42.830 --> 16:44.627
Really?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.490
Okay.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.134
_ Let me
just get some water.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.335
You can just set
those down right there, yeah.

16:59.850 --> 17:01.772
Just give me a sec
to catch my breath

17:01.820 --> 17:03.185
and wipe off the manure.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.585
Sorry.

17:04.620 --> 17:06.542
Thank you so much
for helping out today.

17:06.590 --> 17:10.651
I know it's really hard work
and my mom's been intense.

17:10.690 --> 17:11.679
Intense?

17:13.230 --> 17:15.323
The guys who built
the pyramids got more breaks.

17:17.430 --> 17:18.567
Can we take one?

17:18.600 --> 17:21.137
A break, I mean.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.694
I'd be good
with either a bottle of water

17:22.740 --> 17:26.164
and_a snack _
or you making out With me.

17:27.340 --> 17:28.807
Still with the carpenter.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.705
Worth a shot.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.818
Let's just get
the mulch out there, okay?

17:33.850 --> 17:35.477
Because every minute
those plant roots are exposed

17:35.520 --> 17:37.488
my mom
gets another gray hair.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.215
Shouldn't your mom
be less worried about

17:39.250 --> 17:42.310
what's going into the ground
than what came out of it?

17:42.360 --> 17:44.089
She is worried.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.280
She's really worried.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.194
I think her freaking out

17:47.230 --> 17:50.051
_ _ about azaleas
is just displaced fear.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.335
And she calls
a security company yesterday

17:53.370 --> 17:56.339
asking about
a $10,000 alarm system.

17:56.370 --> 17:58.565
And last night she slept
downstairs in a chair.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.202
Just can't figure out if

18:00.240 --> 18:02.435
she's more afraid of what's
lurking outside of the house

18:02.480 --> 18:04.175
or what's inside.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.199
What are you
talking about?

18:07.550 --> 18:09.848
Nothing.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.847
There's the mulch.

18:10.890 --> 18:11.845
( gasps )

18:11.890 --> 18:13.209
What's up?

18:13.260 --> 18:16.309
I...

18:16.360 --> 18:17.327
Spence,
don't get too close.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.520
Sometimes when they think
they're in danger,

18:18.560 --> 18:20.084
they play dead.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.749
Wait.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.731
Poor thing.
Poisoned.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.260
What?

18:32.170 --> 18:33.330
That's so weird.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.473
We've never had
a rat problem.

18:35.510 --> 18:38.502
I don't even think
we've ever had a rat.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.348
Well,
this was bought last week.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.245
Maybe it's a new problem.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.558
This is too hot.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.524
I don't care if it burns
the roof of my mouth,

18:53.560 --> 18:54.549
I'm starving.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.158
Mm-hmm.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.667
Oh, I don't know
how you can eat that.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.429
Mine's actually
not that hot.

18:59.470 --> 19:00.539
No, it's gross.

19:00.570 --> 19:02.367
Ranch and buffalo chicken?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.231
Well, you know
what they say,

19:04.270 --> 19:05.430
don't knock it
until you try it.

19:05.470 --> 19:06.767
Oh, I have tried it.
Remember?

19:06.810 --> 19:09.506
You made me after
Anna Nordberg's party last fall.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.644
Oh, that did not
turn out so good.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.649
No, it didn't.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.648
SYDNEY: I'll eat anything
except spray cheese.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.513
If it's day-glo orange
and from a can,

19:19.550 --> 19:21.415
not going in my mouth.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.882
Take a deep breath for me.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.191
And another.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.564
Good.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.569
You have quite powerful lungs,
young lady.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.862
Now if you'll tilt
your head,

19:35.900 --> 19:37.663
so I can take a look
at the place

19:37.710 --> 19:39.302
where you were injured.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.342
I want you to come back in again
for an X-ray.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.541
The scar tissue _
may have trapped particles

19:49.580 --> 19:53.289
from whatever
caused the wound.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.584
We were laughing and joking
and then out of nowhere

19:55.620 --> 19:57.349
she totally shuts down.

19:57.390 --> 20:00.826
Well, maybe Paige
is scared of getting too close

20:00.860 --> 20:01.849
and getting
rejected again.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.868
I don't know if it's that.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.293
What?

20:09.340 --> 20:10.500
Nothing.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.565
No, say it.

20:12.610 --> 20:15.431
It's just
I can't help but notice

20:15.480 --> 20:18.506
that you've been
kind of MIA about Ali.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.574
So have you.

20:19.610 --> 20:21.919
Yeah, that's why I've noticed.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.384
We'll get to me
in a second.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.842
I haven't seen you
making any frequent trips

20:25.890 --> 20:27.016
over there either,
by the way.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.018
Her mom was found
buried in my baclqard.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.358
Okay, wait,
can we back up a second?

20:31.390 --> 20:32.482
What are you saying?

20:32.530 --> 20:35.624
You think that I'm scared
to get close to Ali again?

20:36.900 --> 20:38.629
Do you still have
feelings for her?

20:40.900 --> 20:42.788
I don't know.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.637
I really don't.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.728
It's crazy, isn't it?

20:49.780 --> 20:52.340
We've wanted
this for so long,

20:52.380 --> 20:55.645
a life without 'A'
and Ali back.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.544
I thought everything
would feel like it did before.

20:59.590 --> 21:00.579
But it doesn't.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.379
Em...

21:05.530 --> 21:08.897
after what happened
with Nate, did you, like,

21:08.930 --> 21:11.319
find yourself wanting
to know everything about him?

21:16.570 --> 21:19.630
I received the package
from Nate's mom.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.274
I was kind of obsessed
with it.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.947
I kept thinking
what it must have felt like

21:26.980 --> 21:28.447
_ for her
to write my name...

21:29.880 --> 21:32.678
the person who had taken
her son away from her.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.482
And I studied
the printing...

21:40.360 --> 21:41.657
kept imagining
all the places

21:41.700 --> 21:45.693
where I felt that her hands
might have shaken.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.702
Good.

21:56.740 --> 21:57.968
Can you lie back
for me please?

22:06.490 --> 22:07.787
You can sit back up.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.679
If you scoot down
to the edge of the table

22:11.730 --> 22:14.096
so that I can get
a better look at this.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.894
_There's no mention of this
injury on the police report.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.469
I didn't mention it,

22:19.500 --> 22:20.762
'cause I_didn't think
it was important.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.132
It's a significant injury.

22:23.170 --> 22:24.808
How was it sustained?

22:26.640 --> 22:28.278
How did you get hurt?

22:32.150 --> 22:35.472
I cut it on a rock
when I jumped out of the car.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.988
Are you saying this was
from a month ago?

22:38.020 --> 22:39.783
Are you sure?

22:39.820 --> 22:45.884
Scarring is more consistent with
a slice rather than a puncture.

22:45.930 --> 22:47.591
Like from the blade
of a knife or--

22:47.630 --> 22:48.699
I cut it on a rock.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.669
Maybe there was some metal
on it or something.

22:52.700 --> 22:53.997
I don't know.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.133
I mean,
it all happened so fast.

22:56.170 --> 22:57.933
I didn't even feel it.

22:57.970 --> 22:59.904
I didn't even know
I was hurt until I looked down

22:59.940 --> 23:01.771
and I saw the blood.

23:01.810 --> 23:03.607
How was I supposed
to remember?

23:03.650 --> 23:05.606
I was blindfolded
when it happened.

23:05.650 --> 23:08.642
Didn't the police
tell you that on the reports?

23:10.220 --> 23:12.142
Are we done here?

23:12.190 --> 23:13.953
I still need the nurse
to do your blood work.

23:13.990 --> 23:16.185
And we also have
to set up a time

23:16.220 --> 23:18.120
for you to see
a trauma counselor.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.502
Hi.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.518
Oh. Hi.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.211
What were
you just thinking about?

23:43.250 --> 23:44.979
Nothing.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.089
Where's Andrew?

23:47.860 --> 23:49.782
He went back home
to change.

23:49.820 --> 23:50.718
He'll be back.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.785
I'm gonna make him dinner
as a thank you.

23:52.830 --> 23:53.592
Good.

23:53.630 --> 23:56.724
He did such a good job
with the--

23:56.760 --> 23:57.863
with the yard.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.232
Mom? Why won't you
just talk to me?

24:04.270 --> 24:05.601
Do you not trust me?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.699
No, it isn't about trust.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.674
Well, then why won't you
tell me what's going on?

24:09.710 --> 24:12.702
Please, Mom, I don't
want to be alone in this.

24:14.150 --> 24:15.708
I don't want to be either.

24:19.850 --> 24:21.215
Ever since _
they found Je55ica,

24:21.260 --> 24:24.821
I've just-- I've had this
sick feeling in my stomach

24:24.860 --> 24:26.452
and it won't go away.

24:28.260 --> 24:32.026
A couple of days
after Ali went missing,

24:32.070 --> 24:35.836
Jessica came to the_ house
and she was conVInced

24:35.870 --> 24:37.838
that you had done
something to Ali.

24:37.870 --> 24:39.758
She said that?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.598
But she never
went to the cops.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.572
Oh, she did.

24:43.610 --> 24:45.248
Your father said
that he was gonna tell Ken

24:45.280 --> 24:47.578
all about their affair
and destroy their marriage.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.918
So she stayed quiet.

24:49.950 --> 24:52.589
But now that Ken was divorcing
her and Ali was alive,

24:52.620 --> 24:53.848
what was preventing her
from going to the police

24:53.890 --> 24:55.710
and telling them
what she saw?

24:55.760 --> 24:58.024
Exactly what you just
said that All was alive.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.858
But there's still a girl
in that grave who isn't.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.788
Someone killed her.

25:02.830 --> 25:04.923
And Jessica was going
to say that it was you.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.862
I don't know--
I don't know if your father

25:09.900 --> 25:12.266
had anything
to do with this.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.902
I want to believe
that he didn't.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.138
Are you okay?

25:26.190 --> 25:27.919
Yeah.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.882
I can drive
to Longbrook tonight.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.888
Get us food from
that Chinese restaurant

25:31.930 --> 25:32.919
that you like.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.161
What's that?

25:41.200 --> 25:42.929
Can you take this?

25:42.970 --> 25:43.959
Give each of
the girls a copy.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.068
They need to memorize it.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.907
You recorded that?

25:46.940 --> 25:48.578
Hanna, people have been
asking a lot of questions.

25:48.610 --> 25:50.032
We need to keep
our story straight.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.707
Ali, I was here
the whole time.

25:51.750 --> 25:52.899
No, you weren't.

25:52.950 --> 25:54.247
I was in this office
like a half hour

25:54.280 --> 25:56.248
answering questions
before the exam even started.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.713
Well, even so, I mean,

25:57.750 --> 25:59.047
who's going to ask you
questions about that?

25:59.090 --> 26:01.911
Somebody will,
somebody always does.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.053
_ And if it's not Holbrook
it's gonna be someone else.

26:04.090 --> 26:06.126
Look, if they think
I'm lying about this,

26:06.160 --> 26:07.957
it's not gonna be long
before we're all answering

26:08.000 --> 26:09.297
questions about New York.

26:22.010 --> 26:24.001
Ali, where did
that scar come from?

26:25.910 --> 26:28.219
The one on your thigh.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.070
I know it's not from you
being blindfolded

26:30.120 --> 26:31.348
and jumping out of a car.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.915
So how did you get it?

26:37.260 --> 26:39.854
I wish I was blindfolded
when I got that scar.

26:42.330 --> 26:43.922
Did someone
do that to you?

26:46.930 --> 26:48.636
Did you do it to yourself?

26:50.340 --> 26:53.002
Hanna,
once you know something,

26:53.040 --> 26:54.871
you can't unknown it.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.008
Believe me,
I wish I could.

27:30.110 --> 27:31.646
( phone beeps )

27:51.130 --> 27:52.324
Sorry.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.928
I didn't mean
to scare you.

27:53.970 --> 27:55.289
Why are you here?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.932
We have nothing
to talk about.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.700
I disagree.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.435
My answer is still no.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.209
I heard Ali's dad
wants to take her away

28:03.240 --> 28:04.002
from Rosewood.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.302
He spoke to the school
about it.

28:06.350 --> 28:08.045
Ali doesn't want to go,

28:08.080 --> 28:10.310
but maybe
we can change her mind.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.318
I'd be lying if I say
I didn't want to see

28:12.350 --> 28:14.079
that happen, Mona.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.382
But I'm not going
to make it happen.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.183
Fine.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.222
I won't twist your arm.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.319
But just so we are clear,

28:25.100 --> 28:28.137
If you're not with me,
you're against me.

28:28.170 --> 28:30.058
I'm not with anyone.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.067
Sure you are.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.135
At least you want to be.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.104
And Emily's with Ali.

28:36.510 --> 28:38.000
Mona.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.169
I'm just curious.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.472
Do you ever wonder
when you became the very thing

28:43.520 --> 28:45.112
you're afraid of?

28:50.990 --> 28:55.427
* Let it be, clear Lord

28:55.460 --> 28:59.396
* Let it be

28:59.430 --> 29:06.108
* I am weak
but Thou art strong *

29:06.140 --> 29:09.268
* As I walk

29:09.310 --> 29:12.040
* Granted Jesus

29:12.080 --> 29:14.844
* Close to Thee

29:14.880 --> 29:21.410
* I am weak
but Thou art strong *

29:33.570 --> 29:35.492
Hey, what's going on?

29:41.580 --> 29:42.899
What is this?

29:46.450 --> 29:48.077
Ali, no.
Don't, don't look at that.

29:56.090 --> 29:57.921
Maybe I should leave.

30:00.330 --> 30:03.424
It was stupid to think
I could get a new life

30:03.460 --> 30:07.066
by just coming back
from the dead.

30:07.100 --> 30:10.092
Is that what your text
was about?

30:10.140 --> 30:13.200
You're thinking about
not staying here?

30:13.240 --> 30:14.207
No.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.505
We got the tox screen
back from the coroner.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.076
You did?

30:21.250 --> 30:22.842
What did it say?

30:24.350 --> 30:26.215
Someone messed
with her pills.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.116
She had
low blood pressure.

30:31.260 --> 30:33.524
They found Losartan
in her system,

30:33.560 --> 30:36.597
which is
for the opposite problem.

30:36.630 --> 30:38.097
It stopped her heart.

30:45.370 --> 30:47.930
Spencer?

30:47.980 --> 30:50.130
What's wrong?

30:50.180 --> 30:51.374
What just happened?

30:55.180 --> 30:56.442
Did you think
your dad did it?

31:05.060 --> 31:07.278
It's hard, isn't it,

31:07.330 --> 31:08.627
thinking that your parent

31:08.660 --> 31:11.663
could be capable of
something like that.

31:11.700 --> 31:12.894
I know.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.430
I keep trying to find
a good enough reason

31:18.470 --> 31:21.974
that my mom could
just watch someone kill me

31:22.010 --> 31:23.477
and let them walk away.

31:28.350 --> 31:31.239
It's just
there have been monsters

31:31.290 --> 31:34.509
under my bed for so long.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.255
And now when
they're not there anymore,

31:36.290 --> 31:38.087
I feel like
I have to create them.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.249
There's still monsters
out there, Spence.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.895
They just-- they might
not be under our beds.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.337
Hey.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.608
Hi.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.074
Sorry, it was really stupid
of me not to call.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.998
No, it's okay.

32:00.050 --> 32:01.278
Is everything all right?

32:01.320 --> 32:02.241
Sit down, sit down.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.589
I can't stop thinking about
Shana's family.

32:04.620 --> 32:06.349
I mean, every time
I close my eyes

32:06.390 --> 32:07.948
_ all I can see
is her grandmother

32:07.990 --> 32:10.151
and just how destroyed

32:10.190 --> 32:12.329
and how empty
she looked at her funeral.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.398
How did you know what
she looked like at the funeral?

32:18.330 --> 32:23.358
'Cause I watched it online,
many times.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.335
Aria, you're just going
to have to find a way

32:26.370 --> 32:28.008
to forgive yourself.

32:32.350 --> 32:33.601
( door opens )

32:35.350 --> 32:36.374
Hey.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.189
Do you want
to come inside?

32:39.220 --> 32:41.381
I can't stay long.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.058
What's wrong?

32:43.090 --> 32:44.580
I think if Alison
comes back to school,

32:44.630 --> 32:45.949
you should
keep your distance.

32:47.790 --> 32:49.655
Maybe it wasn't a good idea
for us to hang out today.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.190
It has nothing
to do with us, Em.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.323
People are preparing
for Ali's return

32:53.370 --> 32:55.463
and it's not with flowers
and "welcome home" banners.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.060
What are you saying?

32:58.110 --> 33:00.203
I'm saying your friend
hurt a lot of people,

33:00.240 --> 33:01.730
me included.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.372
And I'm not_interested
in continumg that,

33:03.410 --> 33:04.741
but I'm also not going
to out the people

33:04.780 --> 33:06.975
who feel like they need
to protect themselves.

33:08.650 --> 33:11.483
Okay, Paige, wait.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.112
Paige.

33:44.320 --> 33:50.111
* All_ this noise that comes
straight from your heart *

33:50.160 --> 33:53.323
* That I wish it
didn't start *

33:53.360 --> 33:57.797
_* It churns like
v0ices in my head *

33:57.830 --> 33:59.422
Oh, I'm just a friend.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.131
I wasn't able
to send flowers

34:01.170 --> 34:02.694
so I was wondering
ifI could donate

34:02.740 --> 34:04.401
to the cost
of the service.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.805
WOMAN: ( on phone )
Well, her grandmother's

34:05.840 --> 34:08.400
been a_member of our
congregation for a long time.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.408
I'm certain she would want
to thank you for your--

34:10.440 --> 34:13.273
Oh, no, no, I'd really,
really rather the donation

34:13.310 --> 34:14.277
be anonymous.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.810
Is it possible
to send cash?

34:15.850 --> 34:17.078
What are you doing?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.542
Oh, no.
We can't accept cash.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.148
I suppose you
could send it

34:20.190 --> 34:21.179
to Shana's
grandmother directly.

34:21.220 --> 34:22.585
Aria?

34:24.460 --> 34:26.485
That's not trying to find
a way to forgive yourself.

34:26.530 --> 34:28.225
That's hoping
that they forgive you.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.693
It was anonymous.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.459
I'm talking about
the intention behind it.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.092
And even
if they did forgive you,

34:33.130 --> 34:34.358
it's not like they
would do it

34:34.400 --> 34:35.389
because of a donation.

34:37.470 --> 34:38.459
You're right.

34:46.550 --> 34:47.744
I know this isn't easy.

34:50.550 --> 34:52.347
And I can say this to you,

34:52.390 --> 34:56.383
because it's what I have
to tell myself every night.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.653
Once you found out
about the book...

35:03.560 --> 35:05.221
the only thing
that I could think of

35:05.270 --> 35:07.727
was how to make it up
to you.

35:07.770 --> 35:12.400
And I would have done anything
to get you to forgive me.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.671
But I realized that
that might not ever happen

35:15.710 --> 35:18.372
and I had to be
okay with that.

35:30.590 --> 35:32.478
What are you doing?

35:32.530 --> 35:34.498
We're playing checkers.

35:34.530 --> 35:35.497
We are?

35:35.530 --> 35:37.623
Mm-hmm.

35:37.660 --> 35:40.697
And when we get sick of that,
we'll play chess.

35:56.450 --> 35:57.644
SALESGIRL:
How's it going in there?

35:57.680 --> 35:59.238
Did you find
anything that works?

35:59.290 --> 36:02.157
No. No, nothing--
nothing worked.

36:05.860 --> 36:07.487
( footsteps approaching )

36:11.700 --> 36:14.191
( phone ringing )

36:22.310 --> 36:23.709
Hey.

36:23.740 --> 36:24.707
SPENCER: ( on phone )
Hey, I got your message

36:24.750 --> 36:25.876
about the recording.

36:25.910 --> 36:26.979
Can I come over?

36:27.010 --> 36:28.102
I'm confused.

36:28.150 --> 36:30.471
I was with All and she didn't
even mention this.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.579
She didn't?

36:32.620 --> 36:34.679
Maybe that's because
she asked me to give out

36:34.720 --> 36:35.687
the copies.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.812
What's this for?

36:36.860 --> 36:39.351
Is this Ali's idea
or yours?

36:39.390 --> 36:41.597
Hey, it's not just about Ali.
It's about Aria, too.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.291
Well, it's nuts.

36:43.330 --> 36:44.490
Hanna, think it through.

36:44.530 --> 36:45.997
You're asking us
to add on to the lies

36:46.030 --> 36:47.429
that we've already told.

36:47.470 --> 36:48.698
But just memorize it,
Spencer, okay?

36:48.740 --> 36:50.958
I'm not gonna argue
with you on the phone.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.706
If you want to yell
at someone, call Ali.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.230
I'm sick of being
the messenger.

37:00.780 --> 37:01.974
( sighs )

37:02.020 --> 37:05.410
* Now I know we're capable

37:12.490 --> 37:16.654
* Dust myself off

37:16.700 --> 37:20.625
* In nothing but a headwind

37:20.670 --> 37:25.869
* Two steps up
and one back again *

37:25.910 --> 37:29.698
* Rushed in _
and now we're stuffed again *

37:32.310 --> 37:33.846
No, I got this.

37:34.850 --> 37:35.942
Do you want
to talk about it?

37:38.650 --> 37:39.810
There's nothing
to talk about.

37:39.850 --> 37:42.648
It's just my friend's
being an idiot.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.385
( gasps )

37:45.660 --> 37:46.627
Do you want me to--

37:46.660 --> 37:48.753
I'm fine.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.654
I should not be cleaning
knives while I'm angry.

38:07.710 --> 38:07.869
Gin.

38:09.550 --> 38:12.644
Why are you so freakishly
good at this?

38:12.690 --> 38:14.385
I'm not. Ithink
you're just freakishly bad.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.455
Thanks.

38:15.490 --> 38:18.050
Did I mention I am recovering
from a gunshot wound

38:18.090 --> 38:20.729
that might kind of effect
my game, you know.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.455
Your turn to shuffle.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.722
You know,
I may need to call it a night.

38:26.770 --> 38:27.919
I'm kind of
starting to fade.

38:27.970 --> 38:29.528
Oh.

38:29.570 --> 38:30.559
Okay.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.938
Actually would you mind
ifI stayed here?

38:35.980 --> 38:37.732
On the couch.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.449
My dad is up in Harrisburg
for Mike's lacrosse game.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.789
And I can't really face
going home to an empty house.

38:48.990 --> 38:52.357
Yeah, you can use
the blanket on the couch.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.751
This is the one
you liked, right?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.594
Oh, Yeah. Thank you.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.441
You know what?

39:11.480 --> 39:12.447
I'm fine.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.449
I'm just going to go home.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.447
Thanks for the games.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.880
Yeah, anytime.

39:18.920 --> 39:19.887
Goodnight.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.478
Goodnight.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.598
My dad got it for me.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.664
It's nice.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.533
Yeah, he's finally coming
around to the idea of us

39:39.570 --> 39:41.777
staying here.

39:41.810 --> 39:44.370
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

39:47.110 --> 39:49.544
Maybe your dad was right.

39:49.580 --> 39:51.480
Maybe it would be
a good idea

39:51.520 --> 39:54.489
for you to start
over somewhere else.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.078
What?

39:56.120 --> 39:57.883
I just don't think
it's safe.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.751
Emily,
where have you been?

39:59.790 --> 40:01.189
I walked
into that police station

40:01.230 --> 40:02.788
because you convinced me
to come home.

40:02.830 --> 40:04.092
I know, okay.
And I want you here.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.666
Are you sure?

40:05.700 --> 40:07.668
Because it doesn't
feel like it.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.708
I'm going back to school.

40:11.740 --> 40:12.707
And if we just
stick together,

40:12.740 --> 40:14.139
everything
is gonna be fine.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.514
Did Hanna give you
that recording?

40:21.550 --> 40:23.814
Yeah.

40:23.850 --> 40:27.513
And I'll memorize it.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.108
But this is
the last time, Ali.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.549
Okay?
I mean it.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.193
It wasn't
that big of a deal.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.707
I know that it sounds bad

40:44.740 --> 40:45.729
when I say that I almost
slept over at Ezra's,

40:45.770 --> 40:46.930
but nothing
was going to happen.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.608
Yeah.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.005
What I just said makes me
sound like one of those women

40:50.040 --> 40:52.099
who gets pregnant and claims
that they have no idea how

40:52.150 --> 40:54.641
and that it must _have
come from a SWImming pool.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.972
Are you okay?

41:02.990 --> 41:05.720
When All disappeared,

41:05.760 --> 41:07.022
Mrs. D. told my parents
that she thought

41:07.060 --> 41:09.028
that I had
something to do with it.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.948
Yeah, but she knows
who hit Ali over the head.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.967
She knows
that it wasn't you.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.967
Yeah, exactly.

41:13.000 --> 41:13.989
But she was trying
to set me up,

41:14.030 --> 41:16.965
but I'm--
I'm really worried

41:17.000 --> 41:19.036
that my dad
tried to stop her.

41:19.070 --> 41:20.833
You think that your dad--

41:20.870 --> 41:22.633
Yeah, and so does my mom.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.238
I mean
she practically admitted it.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.474
( door opens )

41:27.750 --> 41:29.741
Oh, hi, Aria.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.748
Hi, Mr. Hastings.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.008
Aria's gonna sleep
over tonight.

41:34.050 --> 41:35.756
Great.

41:35.790 --> 41:37.758
Where's mom?

41:38.790 --> 41:40.758
Oh, she's not
coming home tonight.

41:40.790 --> 41:41.722
I dropped her off
at a spa.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.625
She's going to spend
a couple of nights there

41:43.660 --> 41:44.991
to calm her nerves.

41:45.030 --> 41:46.588
What?
When did this happen?

41:46.630 --> 41:47.767
What spa?

41:50.300 --> 41:51.904
I'm gonna go get
ready for bed.

41:54.910 --> 41:56.309
Dad.

41:56.340 --> 41:57.671
Listen, I don't want
you calling your mother

41:57.710 --> 41:58.870
and bothering her.

41:58.910 --> 42:00.741
She really needs to relax.

42:00.780 --> 42:01.815
Why did she suddenly
decide to--

42:01.850 --> 42:02.874
The police
came by to finish up

42:02.920 --> 42:06.287
what they were doing
and she snapped.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.914
Luckily, I was there to keep
them from pressing charges.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.759
Don't worry.

42:13.790 --> 42:15.997
This will all blow over
and she'll be home soon.
