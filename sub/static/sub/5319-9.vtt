00:17.250 --> 00:19.600
How'd you sleep?

00:19.650 --> 00:21.940
Not much, you?

00:21.990 --> 00:23.410
Some.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.250
Not going in to work today?

00:28.300 --> 00:30.810
Nah, maybe next week.

00:30.811 --> 00:32.069
Good.

00:32.070 --> 00:34.290
No need to push yourself.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.330
So how much longer you gonna
sleep in the guest bedroom?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.430
All these years, we never got to the point

00:48.480 --> 00:51.640
we slept in separate beds.

00:53.490 --> 00:55.340
We've blazed a few new trails

00:55.390 --> 00:57.540
these past couple of months, haven't we?

00:57.590 --> 00:58.990
Hm.

01:04.230 --> 01:09.190
I wouldn't be here if I'd given up.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.290
But I can't forget what I know.

01:12.340 --> 01:16.190
And if time can fix that...

01:16.240 --> 01:18.400
I need more time, okay?

01:30.520 --> 01:33.510
Is he there again?

01:33.560 --> 01:36.010
- He's there.
- Is he talking?

01:37.970 --> 01:41.180
No.

01:41.230 --> 01:42.790
Maybe we should ask Dr. Langston

01:42.840 --> 01:46.690
to change your meds, or up them.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.560
She doesn't want to give me anything

01:48.610 --> 01:50.130
that'll turn me into a zombie.

01:50.180 --> 01:51.580
She says I need to learn how to live

01:51.610 --> 01:53.900
with my... hallucinations,

01:53.950 --> 01:55.770
until one day...

01:57.390 --> 01:59.100
Maybe I should cancel the party.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.340
This is all too much to deal with at once.

02:01.390 --> 02:04.380
No, we've pissed off
enough people this year.

02:04.430 --> 02:06.110
I can do this.

02:19.070 --> 02:20.820
Look at me.

02:27.110 --> 02:29.470
He's not there.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.870
Oh, he's there.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.980
He's just not real.

03:59.109 --> 04:00.509
Hey.

04:00.510 --> 04:02.630
Hey!

04:02.680 --> 04:04.460
I need to talk to you.

04:04.510 --> 04:07.530
Tell me where Josh is.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.900
I don't know where he is. Bullshit.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.000
I know that you were with him before he...

04:13.050 --> 04:14.470
What did you do, hm?

04:14.520 --> 04:16.470
Did you pay him to go away?

04:16.519 --> 04:18.110
I swear, I didn't do anything to Josh.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.209
Then just tell me that
he's okay, all right?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.850
I don't need to know
where he went; I don't.

04:21.899 --> 04:23.550
You just need to tell me that he's okay.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.250
Jocelyn, I know what you're feeling.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.720
Really?

04:26.770 --> 04:29.050
You haven't given one
shit about my feelings

04:29.100 --> 04:30.790
since PJ shot himself.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.560
All you've done since
then, all you've done,

04:32.610 --> 04:35.090
is torture me.

04:35.140 --> 04:36.760
But I know why now.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.960
'Cause you know something.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.760
You know how this is all connected.

04:40.810 --> 04:44.300
Josh, PJ's suicide, the rape.

04:44.301 --> 04:45.649
You know.

04:45.650 --> 04:47.510
Jocelyn, you shouldn't be here.

04:47.511 --> 04:48.719
Well, I'm not going anywhere

04:48.720 --> 04:50.340
until Pernell tells me what he knows.

04:50.341 --> 04:51.729
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

04:51.730 --> 04:53.130
- Stop touching me.
- I'm so sorry...

04:53.160 --> 04:54.810
Stop it... you're lying. You're lying!

04:54.860 --> 04:56.680
Things are gonna be hard
enough in court tomorrow.

04:56.681 --> 04:58.029
- You asked me...
- We don't need a preview.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.520
about a stolen book that I didn't even

04:59.570 --> 05:01.020
know was missing until you brought it up.

05:01.070 --> 05:02.850
- How do you know about that?
- He is sick.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.720
He knows less about PJ than you do.

05:04.770 --> 05:08.160
Then why was he PJ's last call?

05:08.210 --> 05:09.630
What?

05:11.649 --> 05:13.049
I found PJ's phone,

05:13.050 --> 05:15.870
and it says Pernell was his last call.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.540
And do you want to know what
PJ did right before that?

05:17.590 --> 05:19.600
Get out of here right now, Jocelyn.

05:19.601 --> 05:20.849
He watched this promo video 23 times...

05:20.850 --> 05:23.710
- Rudy!
- Over and over again,

05:23.760 --> 05:25.240
and then he shot himself.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.710
- Juan!
- Why?

05:27.711 --> 05:29.029
I don't know why.

05:29.030 --> 05:30.359
Then watch it.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.080
Tell me, what does it mean?

05:32.130 --> 05:34.250
Our founder Nathan Brooks,

05:34.300 --> 05:35.920
he realized something,

05:35.970 --> 05:39.020
that our most vital and
abundant human resource...

05:39.070 --> 05:40.620
Get her out of here.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.130
Don't fucking touch me!

05:42.180 --> 05:44.560
If you don't leave here,
I will call the police.

05:47.510 --> 05:49.770
I hate you.

05:49.820 --> 05:51.600
What secrets could we unlock?

05:51.650 --> 05:53.800
What disasters could we avert?

05:53.850 --> 05:56.910
What prophecies could be revealed?

05:56.960 --> 06:00.310
Now, those are just a few of the questions

06:00.360 --> 06:02.410
that we intend to answer.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.410
Enough, Pernell.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.020
Enough.

06:06.070 --> 06:08.150
The city of
San Vicente in our new...

06:26.650 --> 06:28.770
This looks good.

06:28.820 --> 06:32.280
I think we're as ready as we're gonna get.

06:32.281 --> 06:33.559
I don't know.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.110
It still seems kind of thrown together.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.880
I think we should at least paint.

06:38.930 --> 06:41.950
That's exactly what Bishop
Bruce said not to do.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.090
He says the authenticity of
this space is our strength.

06:45.140 --> 06:46.960
I think he's right.

06:47.010 --> 06:48.630
If we can save this old sweatshop,

06:48.680 --> 06:50.390
we can save your soul.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.900
Why not?

06:51.950 --> 06:54.200
We are only what we appear to be,

06:54.250 --> 06:56.700
a simple church uniting
people with the Lord.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.640
Our honesty is our brand.

06:58.690 --> 07:00.140
Speaking of brands, we need to decide

07:00.190 --> 07:01.640
on a toll-free number

07:01.690 --> 07:04.340
for when people call with donations.

07:04.390 --> 07:07.380
It should spell out
something easy to remember,

07:07.430 --> 07:09.410
something with a message,

07:09.460 --> 07:11.010
like...

07:17.400 --> 07:19.660
Hey.

07:19.710 --> 07:22.160
You with me?

07:22.210 --> 07:23.610
Yeah.

07:24.910 --> 07:27.060
I just... I'm thinking about tomorrow.

07:36.220 --> 07:40.740
Tomorrow means that all this is possible.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.350
Now, if we have a child,

07:43.400 --> 07:46.380
I don't know how we'd manage.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.360
You know what?

07:52.410 --> 07:54.020
You're right.

08:09.589 --> 08:10.989
Watch where you're walking, partner.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.980
- Fuck you.
- What the fuck'd you say?

08:19.030 --> 08:20.430
Fuck you, faggot.

08:20.431 --> 08:21.799
Get the fuck out of here.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.620
Come on, pussy!

08:31.280 --> 08:32.730
What's up now, huh?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.460
You're not real.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.300
- You can't be here.
- I need to talk to you.

09:46.350 --> 09:48.640
All right, then, let's
just go around the corner.

09:48.641 --> 09:49.719
No, no.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.980
We're talking right here.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.010
What's wrong?

09:56.060 --> 09:59.050
It was so simple, Pernell,
just the way I like it.

09:59.100 --> 10:02.050
You call me, I come by,
you pay me, I go home.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.020
You had to go and twist it with that ring

10:04.070 --> 10:06.790
and that wedding.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.030
I thought it was the only
way for us to stay together.

10:09.031 --> 10:10.239
Right, because you love me

10:10.240 --> 10:11.690
and can't imagine life without me.

10:11.691 --> 10:12.779
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.049
Exactly.

10:14.050 --> 10:15.530
But as soon as it gets complicated,

10:15.580 --> 10:17.170
- I don't rate for shit.
- That's not true.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.100
Then why'd you call SWAT
on my brother, Pernell?

10:19.150 --> 10:21.070
On my little brother.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.610
Why didn't you come talk to me

10:22.611 --> 10:23.819
before you sicced the dogs on him?

10:23.820 --> 10:25.220
That wasn't my decision.

10:25.230 --> 10:28.550
I didn't even know that was going down.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.810
You see how the world
works for you, Pernell.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.820
You make a mess, and people just
jump in and do your dirty work.

10:33.870 --> 10:36.390
You don't have to take responsibility.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.890
Hell, you don't even have to know about it.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.930
So you're mad at me

10:41.980 --> 10:45.130
for not knowing.

10:45.180 --> 10:48.400
Well, did you know that Khalil
was trying to blackmail me?

10:51.850 --> 10:53.300
No.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.740
He's been sleeping with the light on

10:57.790 --> 10:59.210
ever since that night,

10:59.260 --> 11:03.610
like a little five-year-old.

11:03.660 --> 11:05.060
I'm sorry, Tess.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.650
This should never have gone down.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.250
No shit.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.790
Look, you tell me what to do.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.620
Whatever it is, I do it.

11:15.210 --> 11:16.960
What about my house?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.530
What about your house?

11:18.580 --> 11:20.330
It's ashes.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.670
You don't know about that either?

11:30.560 --> 11:33.580
Do you want chips with your sandwich?

11:33.581 --> 11:34.689
No, thank you.

11:34.690 --> 11:37.750
I'm not really that hungry.

11:37.751 --> 11:38.999
Brother Pernell.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.480
- Hey.
- Where's Keith?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.420
I don't know; I haven't seen him.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.290
Brother Pernell, you had us worried.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.360
Can't tell you how happy I
am to have you back in here.

11:49.410 --> 11:52.060
I'm not back.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.400
I just came to see if you've seen Keith.

11:54.450 --> 11:57.030
You know if he's all right?

11:57.080 --> 11:58.940
I'm afraid I don't.

11:58.990 --> 12:01.370
He hasn't been around the last few days.

12:02.759 --> 12:04.159
If you see him,

12:04.160 --> 12:05.810
would you ask him to call me, please?

12:05.860 --> 12:08.550
Sure.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.080
Is that it?

12:11.130 --> 12:13.250
That's most definitely it.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.720
Did we do something wrong, Brother Pernell?

12:15.770 --> 12:17.390
Did I do something wrong?

12:17.440 --> 12:19.960
That night...

12:20.010 --> 12:23.060
when you approached me in the bar,

12:23.061 --> 12:24.279
did you know who I was?

12:24.280 --> 12:26.460
Or was that just dumb luck?

12:29.020 --> 12:32.570
And did you know about PJ?

12:32.620 --> 12:35.240
Did you know what my son
had just done to himself?

12:35.290 --> 12:37.670
Pernell, where's all this coming from?

12:37.720 --> 12:40.880
You sought me out

12:40.930 --> 12:43.780
in my most vulnerable moment

12:43.830 --> 12:46.520
to use me.

12:46.570 --> 12:47.990
Not to use you.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.720
To offer a helping hand to someone in need.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.560
To fill my fucking head with
whatever I wanted to hear,

12:52.610 --> 12:54.690
just as long as I kept making donations.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.079
All I ever wanted to do

12:56.080 --> 12:57.480
was to put you on the path to salvation.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.660
Did you ever stop to
think of what would happen

12:59.710 --> 13:02.570
by filling my head with
all those delusions?

13:02.620 --> 13:04.330
What do you mean?

13:04.380 --> 13:08.140
I don't want to see you again.

13:08.190 --> 13:10.810
Unless it's to tell me
that Keith is all right.

13:55.300 --> 13:59.420
I did it all wrong.

13:59.470 --> 14:02.360
From the very beginning,
I did it all wrong.

14:07.510 --> 14:12.370
I just thought there'd be more time.

14:12.420 --> 14:15.910
Fucked it all up, PJ.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.640
You're not giving up, are you?

14:24.630 --> 14:26.150
You're not real.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.820
You made a promise, Dad.

14:27.869 --> 14:29.269
How about keeping this one?

14:29.270 --> 14:30.890
For who? For you?

14:30.940 --> 14:32.820
You're not even here.

14:32.869 --> 14:34.269
I made you up

14:34.270 --> 14:36.360
so I could believe that
I could wake you up.

14:36.361 --> 14:37.539
You're not even here.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.730
Shane Caldwell was real.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.630
Julio Farkas is real.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.000
The Eastwood Residences are real.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.700
- That book...
- Stop!

14:54.630 --> 14:59.680
What's real is, I killed an innocent man.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.750
What's real is, I can't wake you up.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.560
All I can do is say good-bye.

15:07.610 --> 15:10.230
You made a promise.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.040
I can't do this anymore.

15:28.090 --> 15:30.250
You said you'd make them pay.

15:41.610 --> 15:44.590
He's going to have to at
least make an appearance.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.330
Hey, I'm afraid of who else
is gonna make an appearance.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.700
What if Pernell is chatting up Mr. Brooks

15:49.750 --> 15:51.930
and he sees PJ sitting by the pool?

15:51.980 --> 15:53.570
No, no, no, it's different now.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.610
Before, he thought they were real,

15:55.660 --> 15:57.370
and how he knows they're not.

15:57.420 --> 15:58.910
I mean, he's getting better.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.810
Yeah, better, not necessarily
ready for prime time.

16:01.829 --> 16:03.229
How's this one look?

16:03.230 --> 16:04.429
Like a mask.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.850
Muy guapo, senor.

16:08.470 --> 16:11.290
Like Liza Minnelli robbed a bank.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.190
All right, no more
sequins. Alfredo, please.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.760
Listen, Dr. Langston was right.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.100
We did push him too far.

16:22.150 --> 16:23.670
And don't forget,

16:23.720 --> 16:27.200
we're gonna be coming back from court.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.210
Who knows what state he's gonna be in?

16:29.260 --> 16:32.110
ÿY qué piensa de éste?

16:32.160 --> 16:33.560
- Esperete.
- ÿCómo no?

16:33.590 --> 16:35.510
- Un momento, por favor.
- Mm-hmm.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.350
Listen, Brooks skipped out
on the President of China

16:44.400 --> 16:46.690
just to check Pernell's temperature.

16:46.740 --> 16:49.230
Please, please, we're talking
about fucking with my...

16:49.280 --> 16:51.230
Your concrete pour.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.230
I am so tired hearing

16:53.280 --> 16:55.130
"Don't fuck with my concrete pour.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.030
Don't fuck with my concrete pour."

16:57.080 --> 17:00.070
You think I get a hard-on
at the thought of wet cement?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.440
Yeah, I do, actually.

17:07.329 --> 17:09.150
Until that concrete is poured,

17:09.199 --> 17:10.598
Brooks can walk away scot-free,

17:10.599 --> 17:12.000
no questions asked.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.650
No penalties, nothing.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.920
But once that gray sludge hits the earth,

17:15.970 --> 17:18.890
they are connected to San Vicente forever,

17:18.909 --> 17:20.309
no matter what Pernell does.

17:20.310 --> 17:21.760
That's what gets me hard.

17:21.810 --> 17:23.930
Pernell needs to be at the party,

17:23.980 --> 17:27.260
just to say hi to Brooks.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.700
Maybe.

17:29.701 --> 17:30.979
No promises.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.700
We'll play it by ear.

17:35.990 --> 17:38.070
Here, try that one.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.940
- Really?
- Mm.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.720
What do you think?

17:50.700 --> 17:53.620
Always with us...

17:53.670 --> 17:56.360
Be with us.

17:56.410 --> 17:59.930
- Amen.
- ♪ With such a good ♪

18:46.630 --> 18:49.350
How are you feeling?

18:49.400 --> 18:51.350
I'm w... woozy.

18:51.351 --> 18:52.699
That's the Dilaudid.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.550
It'll wear off in a couple hours.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.900
You ready, Alicia?

19:09.420 --> 19:12.130
Alicia?

19:12.180 --> 19:14.440
Yeah, I'm ready.

19:14.490 --> 19:16.070
You sure?

19:18.660 --> 19:21.240
If you need a moment to think about this,

19:21.290 --> 19:25.450
now is the time to take it.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.680
He's waiting for me.

19:40.249 --> 19:41.649
We're gonna sit in here

19:41.650 --> 19:45.100
for as long as if we did the procedure.

19:45.150 --> 19:49.470
And I am going to tell you

19:49.520 --> 19:52.040
all about the vacation I just took

19:52.090 --> 19:56.580
and how my dad made me buy an electric car

19:56.630 --> 19:59.150
because global warming is real.

20:00.570 --> 20:02.050
You can tell me where you're from

20:02.100 --> 20:06.320
and how you got that little
scar right next to your eye.

20:06.370 --> 20:08.860
Whatever you want to talk about.

20:08.910 --> 20:10.460
And then when the timer goes off,

20:10.510 --> 20:13.300
a nurse will walk you back out there,

20:13.349 --> 20:14.749
and then it's up to you to decide

20:14.750 --> 20:19.500
when or if he has to know.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.610
How's that sound?

20:22.660 --> 20:24.870
Sounds great.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.510
Okay.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.960
- Hey, Jocelyn.
- Hi.

20:40.010 --> 20:41.560
- Thanks for coming in.
- Yeah.

20:41.610 --> 20:43.730
Did you... did you find Josh?

20:47.350 --> 20:49.030
No, we didn't.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.170
But we found his car outside of Martinez.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.800
Okay.

20:55.450 --> 20:57.510
It was burned pretty badly.

21:05.930 --> 21:08.590
But you... you didn't find a body, right?

21:11.740 --> 21:16.060
We found evidence of
blood on the driver's seat.

21:16.061 --> 21:17.239
There's enough blood

21:17.240 --> 21:20.060
that we're opening a
homicide investigation.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.710
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.180
It's okay, it's okay, here.

21:33.230 --> 21:34.710
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, we got it.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.310
There's a bathroom down the hall.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.310
Okay, sorry.

21:43.570 --> 21:46.120
You gonna tell her Judge
Harris is a suspect?

21:47.410 --> 21:49.630
Not yet. We don't have enough.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.630
We have his fucking fingerprints

21:51.680 --> 21:53.660
on the wine glass in
Josh Miller's apartment.

21:53.710 --> 21:56.200
What more do you need?

22:02.960 --> 22:04.770
Oop, oop.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.150
You look almost like yourself again.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.650
Do I?

22:13.700 --> 22:15.750
Sure wish I felt it.

22:19.870 --> 22:24.130
Yesterday Jocelyn said something.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.760
She said you were his last call.

22:29.820 --> 22:31.900
PJ.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.350
Yeah.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.310
- Why?
- Why did he call me?

22:40.390 --> 22:42.240
You mean instead of you?

22:42.290 --> 22:43.780
Yeah.

22:45.770 --> 22:48.020
I gave him everything.

22:48.070 --> 22:51.250
I'm the one who raised him.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.060
I poured love into that
boy every single day.

22:54.110 --> 22:59.630
I was there for him,
always, no matter what.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.160
You barely tolerated him.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.370
And he called you.

23:07.650 --> 23:09.110
What did he want?

23:09.160 --> 23:11.840
I don't know.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.340
I didn't answer.

23:21.970 --> 23:24.620
The shrink thinks that's
why I keep hearing him,

23:24.670 --> 23:26.260
because I didn't listen.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.630
Guilt, not God.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.630
Yeah.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.430
Something like that.

23:45.690 --> 23:49.750
I went to that church.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.480
Told those hustlers to fuck off.

23:52.530 --> 23:55.020
- Did you?
- Yep.

23:55.070 --> 23:58.120
I'm never going back there again.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.570
Good.

24:12.889 --> 24:14.289
Hey, kid.

24:14.290 --> 24:15.690
Hi.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.470
I heard.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.010
I got to ask,

24:20.060 --> 24:22.680
you sure you want to go through with this?

24:22.681 --> 24:23.959
Yes.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.510
Without Josh's testimony,

24:25.560 --> 24:28.350
they're not gonna allow PJ's video.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.290
We can try.

24:30.340 --> 24:34.690
I don't want you sitting there
while they do a victory lap.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.690
It's just a formality.

24:36.740 --> 24:40.160
Pretty much.

24:40.210 --> 24:43.700
Hey.

24:43.701 --> 24:44.979
Are you sure?

24:44.980 --> 24:46.940
I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction

24:46.990 --> 24:48.810
of watching me give up.

24:51.160 --> 24:54.940
Seriously, if
I bounce and I don't die,

24:54.990 --> 24:57.250
DNR all the way, man.

25:00.930 --> 25:04.450
Your Honor, we're here

25:04.500 --> 25:08.730
to decide what happens
to Pernell Harris, Jr.

25:08.780 --> 25:10.730
They've presented their experts.

25:10.779 --> 25:12.179
We've presented ours.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.400
They're the parents; she's the wife.

25:14.450 --> 25:16.330
We could debate for years.

25:16.380 --> 25:18.940
Except the man whose fate is in question

25:18.990 --> 25:22.270
has spoken with that video.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.910
There's no question that's PJ Harris.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.570
There's no question what he is saying.

25:25.620 --> 25:29.580
The question is whether
that video is admissible.

25:29.630 --> 25:31.050
And it's not.

25:31.100 --> 25:33.920
It is impossible to discern state of mind.

25:33.970 --> 25:35.820
He could have said, "I'm
going to shoot the president,"

25:35.870 --> 25:39.760
and we wouldn't know if
he's joking or serious.

25:39.810 --> 25:41.390
He's right, Mr. Tramble.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.230
Then we would like to ask for a continuance

25:43.280 --> 25:45.230
until we can bring in Josh Miller,

25:45.280 --> 25:47.330
the person who filmed that video.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.870
Why isn't Mr. Miller here now?

25:49.920 --> 25:52.570
We cannot locate him
at this time, your Honor.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.840
Mr. Tramble, isn't it your client

25:54.890 --> 25:57.040
who requested an expedited court hearing?

25:57.090 --> 25:58.640
Yes, but that was before...

25:58.690 --> 26:00.810
You're asking
me to disregard the law,

26:00.860 --> 26:03.580
which I will not do.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.850
The video will remain inadmissible,

26:05.851 --> 26:06.969
and in lieu of...

26:06.970 --> 26:08.229
Any further evidence,

26:08.230 --> 26:10.950
- I must rule for the plaintiff.
- Wait.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.640
No.

26:19.610 --> 26:22.800
We don't have to do this anymore.

26:22.850 --> 26:25.800
Excuse me?

26:25.850 --> 26:27.250
Pernell...

26:28.390 --> 26:29.790
Pernell.

26:31.360 --> 26:34.580
My son is gone.

26:34.630 --> 26:36.080
I know that now.

26:40.870 --> 26:44.120
Nobody's going to win here today.

26:44.170 --> 26:48.490
But if anyone should decide
when to pull the plug,

26:48.540 --> 26:51.690
it's Jocelyn.

26:51.740 --> 26:55.830
Mr. Harris, am
I hearing you correctly?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.370
Yes, Your Honor.

27:08.190 --> 27:10.480
We would like to dismiss our action

27:10.530 --> 27:13.080
on one condition,

27:13.130 --> 27:17.020
that his mother and I get to be there

27:17.070 --> 27:21.290
when she takes him off life support.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.990
That's all I ask.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.530
That's fine.

28:02.550 --> 28:03.970
You're making too much of this.

28:04.020 --> 28:06.140
- I'm fine. I can walk.
- Sit down.

28:06.190 --> 28:08.440
- I'll make you some tea.
- Okay.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.090
Hey.

28:14.630 --> 28:16.750
Get out.

28:18.660 --> 28:21.820
Please, I got nowhere to go.

28:21.870 --> 28:23.620
I don't care.

28:23.670 --> 28:26.920
How could you even think of
walking through these doors?

28:26.970 --> 28:29.260
You almost killed Alicia.

28:31.139 --> 28:32.539
I know.

28:32.540 --> 28:33.879
Ohh...

28:33.880 --> 28:37.230
I made a mistake.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.680
Fuck.

28:40.550 --> 28:42.500
I made a lot.

28:42.550 --> 28:46.010
I don't want to... I
don't want to go to hell.

28:46.060 --> 28:48.310
I want to be clean again.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.050
Not here.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.510
I want you out of this church,

28:52.560 --> 28:53.960
right now.

29:03.479 --> 29:04.879
KD...

29:04.880 --> 29:06.660
Let him go.

29:08.550 --> 29:10.100
- No, KD, wait.
- Alicia.

29:10.150 --> 29:11.670
Why can't we help him?

29:11.720 --> 29:14.570
'Cause he tried to burn
down a house with you in it.

29:14.571 --> 29:15.689
No, he didn't, Paul.

29:15.690 --> 29:16.859
He tried to save me.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.159
From a fire he started.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.880
Sometimes you can't get in the way

29:19.881 --> 29:21.029
of who people are.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.129
Look at him.

29:22.130 --> 29:23.229
God knows what he's done.

29:23.230 --> 29:25.280
Yes, God does know,

29:25.330 --> 29:27.620
just like He knows
everything that we've done.

29:27.670 --> 29:29.420
You stop!

29:29.470 --> 29:30.990
God loves us.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.690
He forgives us.

29:32.709 --> 29:34.109
He wants us to be more.

29:34.110 --> 29:37.230
God loves all of us.

29:37.280 --> 29:41.760
There's forgiveness for
everyone, isn't there?

30:11.540 --> 30:14.030
That was brave, what you did today.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.770
So why doesn't it feel that way?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.180
Because...

30:32.730 --> 30:37.250
because we're not gonna be parents anymore.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.360
That's not how it's supposed to be.

30:56.590 --> 31:01.110
I should have let you cancel this party.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.880
I can cover for you.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.650
Take as long as you need.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.940
Oh, you're so sweet.

31:59.990 --> 32:02.500
Gorgeous, gorgeous.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.150
Oh...

32:12.200 --> 32:14.580
I love this cornucopia.

32:14.630 --> 32:16.550
There she is.

32:16.551 --> 32:17.839
Hi.

32:17.840 --> 32:18.969
You cannot leave here

32:18.970 --> 32:20.760
until we have a chance to catch up, okay?

32:20.810 --> 32:22.220
Great.

32:22.270 --> 32:23.670
Remind me of Cat Woman.

32:23.710 --> 32:26.330
Doesn't she look a
little bit like Cat Woman?

32:27.449 --> 32:28.849
Look familiar?

32:28.850 --> 32:30.500
- Are those golf shoes?
- Speaking of which...

32:30.550 --> 32:33.370
You wore those the first
time we met at Pebble Beach.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.340
There's a steel trap behind that mask.

32:35.390 --> 32:37.970
Or I made a good first impression.

32:38.020 --> 32:41.810
Well, who could forget
your humiliating defeat?

32:41.860 --> 32:44.950
Really, you just gonna shit
on my sentimental moment?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.620
Well, I was gonna say,

32:47.670 --> 32:49.520
look at us now,

32:49.570 --> 32:52.190
getting ready to put
San Vicente on the map.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.260
It was three years well spent.

32:54.310 --> 32:55.820
Three.

32:55.870 --> 32:57.690
I've been trying to make
something like this happen

32:57.691 --> 32:59.039
for almost 20.

32:59.040 --> 33:02.000
It might be another day at the
office for you, little lady,

33:02.050 --> 33:04.070
but for me it's history.

33:04.079 --> 33:05.479
Give it up.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.200
Sorry, can you just hold that?

33:09.260 --> 33:12.110
It's Guy. He's here with Mr. Brooks.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.980
- But they can wait a little...
- Hello?

33:14.030 --> 33:15.880
Just gonna leave a man hanging?

33:18.060 --> 33:22.220
You said you wanted me
to be designated driver.

33:22.270 --> 33:25.650
You know where we
want to be when we figure it out?

33:25.700 --> 33:31.700
The city of San Vicente,
in our new headquarters.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.930
Brooks sees
something I think you're missing,

33:34.980 --> 33:37.600
something a lot of people are missing.

33:37.650 --> 33:39.500
They're an emerging tech giant,

33:39.550 --> 33:41.140
and we're the next Silicon Valley,

33:41.190 --> 33:42.670
two halves that make a whole.

33:42.720 --> 33:46.310
Brooks Innovations is gonna
connect us to tomorrow.

33:46.311 --> 33:47.689
Isn't that their slogan?

33:47.690 --> 33:49.750
- Is it? How about that.
- I think it is.

34:00.870 --> 34:04.130
Mrs. Harris, I'm sure you remember...

34:04.180 --> 34:06.560
Nathan, welcome.

34:06.561 --> 34:07.879
So wonderful of you to come.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.800
Thank you for having me, Mrs. Harris.

34:10.801 --> 34:12.119
Oh, please. Crystal.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.170
We'll be neighbors soon.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.100
Oh, just water for me, please.

34:16.101 --> 34:17.489
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.580
This is your first Crystal Harris party.

34:19.630 --> 34:21.280
The water's in the pool.

34:21.330 --> 34:23.409
Nathan just flew in from Beijing.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.750
I'm sure he's exhausted.

34:25.751 --> 34:26.869
He's right.

34:26.870 --> 34:28.520
One drink would knock me right out.

34:28.569 --> 34:29.969
I'll take tap if I have to.

34:29.969 --> 34:31.590
No, no, no.

34:31.639 --> 34:34.020
We will get you a morning rooster.

34:34.021 --> 34:35.409
And you will be wide awake

34:35.409 --> 34:37.889
when you crawl back to your hotel room,

34:37.891 --> 34:39.239
in the morning.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.900
I won't be here until the morning.

34:40.949 --> 34:43.969
Just long enough to say
hi to you and Pernell.

34:44.020 --> 34:45.699
Where is he?

34:47.989 --> 34:50.310
As part of Brooks' exploratory team,

34:50.360 --> 34:52.310
my main task was to research

34:52.360 --> 34:54.780
the lifestyle and cultural amenities here

34:54.830 --> 34:56.909
and determine whether
they would be a good fit...

34:58.360 --> 35:01.050
I heard
some of your colleagues...

35:01.051 --> 35:02.399
Damn.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.220
I hate when that boy's right.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.560
Asa told me you were up here.

35:07.569 --> 35:08.969
But I said, "No, he's not.

35:08.970 --> 35:10.760
He's downstairs, working the crowd."

35:10.810 --> 35:12.690
Then I looked for you, couldn't find you.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.160
Then I thought, maybe
he's fucking a waitress.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.770
But alas, no.

35:16.820 --> 35:19.000
You're up here rubbing
one out to Internet porn.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.840
Remember that Brooks
promo that made the news?

35:24.120 --> 35:27.110
Last thing PJ watched
before he shot himself.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.910
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.650
I got this mask on.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.380
I think I heard you telling me

35:33.429 --> 35:34.829
that you're ready to go downstairs

35:34.830 --> 35:37.050
and show Nathan Brooks whose house this is.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.220
He's here?

35:43.221 --> 35:44.539
Yeah.

35:44.540 --> 35:46.500
Flew in from China early.

35:46.550 --> 35:50.800
He wants to see for himself
that you're still yourself.

35:50.850 --> 35:53.470
Well, I'm not sure he's gonna get that.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.510
I heard what you did in court today.

35:58.560 --> 36:02.780
I think that's a hell of
a step back towards normal.

36:02.830 --> 36:05.650
Yeah, it's not gonna be just as easy

36:05.700 --> 36:07.420
as putting on a tux, you know.

36:07.470 --> 36:09.550
Probably not, but then
again, somebody once said,

36:09.600 --> 36:11.850
clothes make the man.

36:13.770 --> 36:15.790
I'll take a straitjacket.

36:17.540 --> 36:19.030
You know what?

36:19.049 --> 36:20.449
Fuck Brooks.

36:20.450 --> 36:22.130
I'll tell him you knocked off early.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.600
All right?

36:23.650 --> 36:25.800
He can get these nuts
if he don't like that.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.540
Ah, fuck it.

36:30.059 --> 36:31.459
I'm good.

36:31.460 --> 36:34.040
Are you good good?

36:34.059 --> 36:35.459
No.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.410
But I can fake it.

36:37.460 --> 36:40.120
Hey, it's a masquerade ball.

36:40.170 --> 36:41.620
We're all faking it.

36:41.670 --> 36:43.650
By the way, there's a
waitress in the closet.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.690
I think she's into bowlegged black dudes.

36:45.740 --> 36:48.590
Shit, they all are, baby.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.880
See you downstairs.

37:14.970 --> 37:17.150
Are you ready, Brother KD?

37:20.510 --> 37:22.620
Could we do something first?

37:25.110 --> 37:26.510
What?

37:29.180 --> 37:32.000
I need to confess my sins.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.100
No, you don't, KD.

37:34.150 --> 37:36.710
We don't have to confess to anyone.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.040
We just have to ask for God's forgiveness

37:39.090 --> 37:42.040
and let him take the burden of our sins.

37:45.760 --> 37:50.350
I know that's what they say, but...

37:50.400 --> 37:53.890
things I've done...

37:53.940 --> 37:59.730
I think I need to say them out loud.

37:59.780 --> 38:02.130
I understand, Brother KD.

38:04.280 --> 38:07.640
Whatever you tell me, God will forgive.

38:19.570 --> 38:22.080
I have followed the
words of a false prophet.

38:23.740 --> 38:26.250
He said he was anointed.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.190
He said I...

38:28.240 --> 38:30.190
He said I was his Benaiah.

38:33.610 --> 38:35.630
Are you talking about Brother Pernell?

38:41.150 --> 38:42.640
Yes.

38:50.900 --> 38:54.550
I did whatever he told me to.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.120
I hurt people.

38:57.170 --> 39:03.020
I spilled the blood of
an innocent man... men.

39:05.910 --> 39:09.300
And I did it all in the name of the Lord.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.880
What was your wish?

39:25.930 --> 39:27.880
If I told you, it wouldn't
come true, would it?

39:27.930 --> 39:29.790
Oh, no, no, that's just for birthday cakes.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.690
I think wishing trees are foolproof.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.890
Glad you could make it.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.630
No mask?

39:36.680 --> 39:38.760
Nothing to hide.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.460
Well, I appreciate you having me.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.260
I didn't want to miss this.

39:42.310 --> 39:43.710
And my mother taught me

39:43.720 --> 39:46.500
never to come to a
party empty-handed, so...

39:46.550 --> 39:48.440
this is for you.

39:48.490 --> 39:50.070
- Both of you.
- Oh, thank you.

39:52.660 --> 39:55.210
Wow.

39:55.260 --> 39:58.110
That's... pretty.

39:58.160 --> 40:01.180
Yes, but it looks like
it's for something illegal.

40:01.230 --> 40:03.280
It's called a lachrymatory.

40:03.330 --> 40:05.290
In ancient Rome, they
were used to collect tears

40:05.340 --> 40:07.620
in a time of grief.

40:07.670 --> 40:10.290
See how the stopper fits loosely?

40:10.340 --> 40:12.260
To let the tears evaporate.

40:12.261 --> 40:13.579
Once the bottle is dry,

40:13.580 --> 40:14.909
it's time to come out of mourning,

40:14.910 --> 40:17.000
and you bury that with your loved one.

40:21.250 --> 40:24.240
That's a very touching gesture, thank you.

40:24.290 --> 40:27.610
I know it's been a difficult
time for your family.

40:27.660 --> 40:30.880
For our family or for me?

40:30.930 --> 40:33.850
Well, losing a child, I'm sure,

40:33.900 --> 40:35.820
would be a struggle for anyone,

40:35.870 --> 40:38.450
especially someone with a
job as stressful of yours.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.090
You've heard things.

40:44.140 --> 40:47.430
You're worried about our arrangement.

40:47.480 --> 40:50.330
But what happens in my family
is none of your business.

40:50.380 --> 40:54.870
Your family is San Vicente,
for all practical purposes.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.570
Moving my business here is
like joining that family.

40:58.620 --> 41:00.380
So is this the wedding feast?

41:00.430 --> 41:01.940
Just an engagement party.

41:01.941 --> 41:03.189
Ah.

41:03.190 --> 41:05.110
But we all want to see commitments made,

41:05.160 --> 41:06.560
rings exchanged,

41:06.600 --> 41:09.220
before anybody gets fucked.

41:09.270 --> 41:11.520
Nobody wants any wedding night surprises.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.970
Mm-hmm.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.260
Well, you picked a good night, Nathan.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.860
Everybody who matters
in San Vicente is here.

41:20.910 --> 41:23.460
Some of them hate me, some of them love me.

41:23.510 --> 41:24.930
But they're here,

41:24.980 --> 41:27.970
because I want them here.

41:28.020 --> 41:30.570
You want to check me out? Walk the room.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.710
Ask anybody in here

41:32.760 --> 41:34.780
if I've ever failed to
provide a river of money

41:34.830 --> 41:37.410
flowing in their direction.

41:37.460 --> 41:40.120
Ask anybody if they're dissatisfied.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.250
We good?

41:43.300 --> 41:45.150
Yes.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.020
Yes, I think we are.

41:51.410 --> 41:53.090
Welcome to the family.

41:55.110 --> 41:57.300
How'd you like that drink?

41:57.350 --> 41:58.750
I liked it.

41:58.780 --> 42:00.500
It made me hungry.

42:00.550 --> 42:02.000
Right this way.

42:09.930 --> 42:13.550
How deep are God's riches
and wisdom and knowledge.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.180
How unfathomable are his decisions

42:15.230 --> 42:19.760
and unexplainable are his ways.

42:19.810 --> 42:21.390
Judge not.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.560
Not even yourself.

42:23.610 --> 42:27.060
For today, through the power
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

42:27.110 --> 42:29.770
you will be born again.

42:29.820 --> 42:31.770
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.840
Be happy and rejoice,

42:37.890 --> 42:39.510
for today your sins are washed away

42:39.560 --> 42:41.210
by the blood of the Lamb.

42:41.211 --> 42:42.159
Amen.

42:42.160 --> 42:46.110
Truly, truly, I say to you,

42:46.160 --> 42:51.120
except a man be born of
the water and of the Spirit,

42:51.170 --> 42:54.790
he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.240
Amen.

43:02.050 --> 43:03.530
Amen!

43:06.050 --> 43:07.450
Paul!

43:20.270 --> 43:23.150
Keith Dennison, God has freed you

43:23.200 --> 43:26.090
from the shackles of your old life.

43:26.140 --> 43:28.960
Go forth and serve until
the end of your days.

43:29.010 --> 43:30.930
He'll show you the way.

43:46.260 --> 43:49.210
Oh, man, you're a lady of your word.

43:53.530 --> 43:56.050
I've got to hand it to you, Pernell.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.750
You made a very good
impression on Mr. Brooks.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.020
Crystal got him drunk.

44:01.021 --> 44:02.309
Now we'll just have ourselves

44:02.310 --> 44:03.960
a nice extravagant concrete pour,

44:04.010 --> 44:06.090
and all our troubles
will be behind us, huh?

44:06.140 --> 44:09.300
Well, I'm sure it's not gonna
be entirely without difficulties.

44:09.350 --> 44:10.930
Hey, this is my big moment.

44:10.980 --> 44:13.530
You give me any shit,
I'll have you deported.

44:13.580 --> 44:16.070
Hey, you can't do
that. I'm an American citizen.

44:16.071 --> 44:17.359
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.410
I was only raised in England.

44:19.460 --> 44:21.980
Well, who knew?

44:21.981 --> 44:23.229
That's right.

44:23.230 --> 44:27.320
You were born in... Connecticut, right?

44:27.321 --> 44:28.569
Mm-hmm.

44:28.570 --> 44:29.769
What city was that?

44:29.770 --> 44:30.769
New Canaan.

44:30.770 --> 44:32.490
New Canaan.

44:38.210 --> 44:39.900
Well, I guess you're safe, then.

44:41.380 --> 44:43.430
How long you been living in the U.S.?

44:43.480 --> 44:46.300
I moved to London when I was two.

44:46.350 --> 44:49.040
You're barely an American, then.

44:49.090 --> 44:52.270
Now, Anne, you're
not commuting back and forth.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.180
- You actually moved here.
- Yeah, that's right.

44:54.230 --> 44:56.910
As part of Brooks' exploratory team,

44:56.960 --> 44:58.610
my main task was to research

44:58.660 --> 45:01.320
the lifestyle and cultural amenities here

45:01.370 --> 45:04.220
and determine whether
they would be a good fit...

45:04.270 --> 45:06.090
Why am I suddenly worried about

45:06.140 --> 45:08.260
what the fuck you're about to do?

45:08.310 --> 45:09.930
You heard what she said, right?

45:09.931 --> 45:10.979
New Canaan?

45:10.980 --> 45:12.039
Yes, New Canaan.

45:12.040 --> 45:13.490
Richest part of Connecticut.

45:13.491 --> 45:14.849
Old Canaan,

45:14.850 --> 45:16.460
land of the milk and honey.

45:16.510 --> 45:18.330
What the fuck are you
talking about, Pernell?

45:18.380 --> 45:21.170
Straight out of the Bible.

45:21.220 --> 45:24.310
No, no, Pernell, not now, not here, please.

45:24.360 --> 45:28.040
Before he shot himself,
PJ watched this video over and over again.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.459
Okay, just go upstairs.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.759
Go upstairs, lay down
until the party's over.

45:30.760 --> 45:33.050
I had honey, she had milk.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.120
- Crystal...
- Do you know the mayor?

45:38.121 --> 45:39.439
Not right now.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.160
I need to talk to you for a second.

45:41.210 --> 45:42.610
We have a situation.

45:51.650 --> 45:53.200
Colleague
stayed at the Mondrian,

45:53.250 --> 45:55.000
but you didn't; you rented this condo.

45:55.050 --> 45:57.970
Actually, I bought this condo, yeah.

45:58.020 --> 45:59.540
I felt that the only way

45:59.590 --> 46:02.010
to truly get to know
the people of San Vicente

46:02.060 --> 46:03.810
is to live with them.

46:03.860 --> 46:05.480
What are you doing, man?

46:05.530 --> 46:07.520
There's got to be something I'm missing.

46:07.570 --> 46:10.250
I felt from the start that San Vicente

46:10.300 --> 46:12.050
reflects the values that Nathan Brooks...

46:12.051 --> 46:13.299
Pernell, turn it off.

46:13.300 --> 46:14.720
Shh.

46:14.770 --> 46:16.220
And the
people here are really good,

46:16.270 --> 46:19.160
honest, hard-working souls.

46:19.210 --> 46:20.760
And I'm sure you hear this all the time,

46:20.810 --> 46:23.130
but the weather's wonderful.

46:23.180 --> 46:25.000
You're not from
California, I take it.

46:25.050 --> 46:26.570
No, I'm from England.

46:34.890 --> 46:36.440
Oh, my God.

46:38.530 --> 46:40.520
It's the book.

46:40.521 --> 46:41.729
It's PJ's book.

46:41.730 --> 46:43.320
Pernell...

46:52.940 --> 46:55.630
There you are. Finally got a drink.
