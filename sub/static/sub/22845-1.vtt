00:02.836 --> 00:07.307
- Welcome to another episode of
the Kira Soltanovich Show.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.809
So, here I am pregnant,

00:09.810 --> 00:11.444
and I'm gonna shoot a special.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.346
Is that good,

00:12.347 --> 00:13.446
or do you think people are gonna

00:13.447 --> 00:15.748
look at me and think,
it's like a gimmick?

00:15.749 --> 00:18.951
- No I disagree it's obvious you're preg.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.489
- I don't know why
it's so hard to be men.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.491
- What's your list? Let me hear it.
- It's a very serious list.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.460
- Okay here we go.
- Episiotomy, episioto-you.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.365
- And a lot of my material is about
pregnancy, being a mom, married.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.434
Is that too one note?

00:34.435 --> 00:36.503
Yes.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.405
- Stirrup yourself in.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.006
- Stirrup yourself in!

00:40.007 --> 00:42.275
How 'bout OBG why am I here?

00:43.844 --> 00:45.878
- You're the leader,
you're a revolutionary.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.881
- When's the next time
a woman whose gor...

00:48.882 --> 00:50.950
Who cares about gorgeous?
You're smart.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.652
- When's the next time a
woman's gonna be pregnant?

00:52.653 --> 00:57.790
- I give it four centimeters,
Monthly Parent's magazine.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.592
- Well I am the Rosa Parks

00:59.593 --> 01:01.794
- of pregnant comics.
- You are.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.596
- Bring the gaff-orceps.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.433
You see the artwork already.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.335
- It sounds vaguely Yiddish.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.705
- It's not that oh darling
you can be president.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.441
No you can be pregnant
and do a fucking special.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.509
- Boom.
- Woah.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.910
- Even better than president.
- She just dropped the mic...

01:17.911 --> 01:18.912
* upbeat jazz music.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.778
- Ladies
and gentleman,

01:27.821 --> 01:29.422
Kira Soltanovich.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.267 --> 01:43.503
- Wow.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.438
Hello everybody.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.307
Yes.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.177
Oh my goodness exciting.

01:50.178 --> 01:54.047
Hey guess who
doesn't use condoms.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.853
Hey I am three weeks pregnant.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.090
It's gonna be a big baby.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.927
Instead of prenatals,
I'm taking steroids so.

02:09.363 --> 02:12.532
I was told by so many people

02:12.533 --> 02:15.134
you need to come out on stage

02:15.135 --> 02:19.606
with like a fake hand
hanging out, just a fake...

02:22.576 --> 02:25.445
And I thought about it.
I thought it'd be funny,

02:25.446 --> 02:27.447
maybe just like
have it hanging out,

02:27.448 --> 02:28.481
but don't say anything.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.383
Just walk out, "Hey
what's happening."

02:30.384 --> 02:31.918
Good to see ya, sweet nuts.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.853
"What's going on yeah"

02:33.854 --> 02:35.655
and then half way through
the show look down

02:35.656 --> 02:38.057
and be like "No!"

02:38.058 --> 02:41.428
Mommy's working."

02:44.398 --> 02:46.266
I know, I know, I should have

02:46.267 --> 02:49.002
or at least like some sort
of water pouch device.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.274
Right?

02:54.275 --> 02:57.310
That would be hilarious.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.546
And just find the most
nervous looking dude,

02:59.547 --> 03:02.415
sugar nipples, that's you.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.916
That would be you.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.219
And just out of nowhere
I pull a cord,

03:06.220 --> 03:09.356
it's happening!

03:09.357 --> 03:13.760
Just drown you from head to toe.

03:13.761 --> 03:17.264
Would that scar you for life?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.466
But what if I made it
like an awesome flavor,

03:19.467 --> 03:20.867
like PiÃ±a colada.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.471
So you're like "No..."

03:24.472 --> 03:27.040
"Oh my God, oh my God."

03:28.709 --> 03:32.111
"This is amazing."

03:32.112 --> 03:34.447
I- I already have a four year
old

03:34.448 --> 03:38.385
so this is numero dos.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.354
Because it might be Mexican.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.926
We're going to find out soon.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.628
We will see, we will find out.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.730
I'm excited.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.466
I was giving my four year
old a bath the other day.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.503
Because you have to bathe them.

03:57.805 --> 04:03.510
Every day or they will take
the baby away from you.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.977
So I'm giving him a bath.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.112
You know, front to back.

04:06.113 --> 04:09.582
I'm not an animal, you
know, front to back

04:09.583 --> 04:11.684
and right as I'm
getting to the...

04:13.721 --> 04:14.655
Right as I, you know, 'taint
misbehaving, you know.

04:14.656 --> 04:16.723
Right there.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.759
He's stops me, he puts his hand

04:19.760 --> 04:21.628
on my arm and he goes,

04:21.629 --> 04:24.464
"You're a nice lady."

04:30.571 --> 04:33.641
Do you know how
uncomfortable it is

04:34.642 --> 04:37.744
when you have your hand

04:37.745 --> 04:39.646
between someone's butt cheeks

04:39.647 --> 04:42.582
and they wink at you and go,

04:42.583 --> 04:46.653
"You're a nice lady."

04:46.654 --> 04:49.422
I felt so cheap in that moment.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.325
Like he had hired me
off of Craigslist.

04:54.261 --> 04:57.029
I feel a little guilty,

04:57.030 --> 05:00.433
because with number one...

05:00.434 --> 05:02.168
With number one you
spend so much time trying

05:02.169 --> 05:05.738
to connect with the baby.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.008
You start talking to the baby.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.978
I was in prenatal
yoga, you know.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.313
I was in warrior two

05:14.314 --> 05:17.083
and I was meditating

05:17.084 --> 05:18.785
and I was playing
classical music

05:18.786 --> 05:21.521
so that it goes to a
good junior college.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.592
And I was singing songs to it.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.594
I was just like,

05:27.595 --> 05:30.797
* There's a miracle
inside of me *

05:30.798 --> 05:33.366
And now with this one,

05:33.367 --> 05:34.701
this baby,

05:34.702 --> 05:38.337
you what this baby
hears on a daily basis?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.907
Put on your shoes!

05:45.513 --> 05:46.846
And then I remember,

05:46.847 --> 05:50.450
* There's a miracle
inside of me *

05:50.451 --> 05:54.388
You're going to have
to get a personality.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.393
I'm a little cranky,
I'm sorry if I'm cranky.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.530
I apologize. I'm not
getting enough sleep.

06:03.531 --> 06:07.233
It's just... it's hard now.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.936
First of all do you guys
know when you are pregnant,

06:09.937 --> 06:11.137
there are rules?

06:11.138 --> 06:14.641
You're not allowed to
sleep on your back.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.875
Did you know that?

06:15.876 --> 06:20.613
The way that you got
pregnant is not allowed.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.283
This is true.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.486
You're supposed to sleep
with special pillows.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.922
There's a wedge and
there's a snoogle

06:29.923 --> 06:31.991
and you put a pillow
in your crotch

06:31.992 --> 06:33.259
and then around hip

06:33.260 --> 06:35.094
and then I put one on
my husband's crotch,

06:35.095 --> 06:37.930
'cause don't touch me.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.635
And then you gotta put
one under here and under

06:42.636 --> 06:45.572
and then you end up
building a nest to sleep in,

06:45.573 --> 06:47.574
like a chicken.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.042
It takes me twenty minutes

06:50.043 --> 06:52.645
to get into bed at night

06:52.646 --> 06:54.447
because I'm just
collecting everything.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.121
Just collecting my nest.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.559
Just forty pillows.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.560
So I can...

07:08.929 --> 07:11.964
I get in my little
nest right I get...

07:14.468 --> 07:17.403
and then I have to pee.

07:23.410 --> 07:27.079
So I get out of my nest

07:27.080 --> 07:29.281
and then I'm not
getting enough sleep.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.751
My kid all of a
sudden out of nowhere,

07:31.752 --> 07:33.886
5 o'clock in the
morning he wakes up.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.556
Out of nowhere,

07:36.557 --> 07:40.226
"Mommy!"

07:40.227 --> 07:44.330
Like he's athletic heckling me.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.099
"Mom!"

07:47.100 --> 07:49.268
"Easy out."

07:49.269 --> 07:50.603
So I go down to his room.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.271
It's five, it's still dark.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.207
I try to convince him
it's still night time.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.309
Right I go, "Go back to sleep."

07:57.310 --> 07:59.445
"Look it's still night time."

07:59.446 --> 08:01.848
"It's the middle of the
night, go back to sleep."

08:01.849 --> 08:04.717
And he goes, "No it's not."

08:04.718 --> 08:08.921
"It's time to wake up."

08:08.922 --> 08:11.157
And I go, "No, no,
no go back to sleep."

08:11.158 --> 08:13.492
He goes, "No it's
morning Mommy."

08:13.493 --> 08:15.795
And that's when I start
talking through my face,

08:15.796 --> 08:18.365
"You're going back to sleep."

08:19.967 --> 08:23.936
"It's still night-night."

08:23.937 --> 08:27.808
And he says to me, "It's
over for you mommy."

08:29.409 --> 08:33.078
Now he's talking
about night-night,

08:33.080 --> 08:37.216
but I took it like my life.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.289
I get back to my room, right.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.958
Go back, get into my nest.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.695
Right, get back in.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.162
My husband is asleep,

08:50.163 --> 08:55.334
of course has slept through
this entire transaction.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.573
With that face,
that snorer's face.

09:00.574 --> 09:04.343
Change your face.

09:04.344 --> 09:08.981
It can't be the same
face day in and day out.

09:08.982 --> 09:13.319
Change your face,
put on a funny hat,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.121
or a silly bow tie,
or something just a...

09:18.692 --> 09:21.260
And he knows I can't sleep
with any extra sounds.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.528
He know this

09:22.529 --> 09:25.331
and I feel like he's
doing it on purpose.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.967
I feel like he's snoring

09:27.968 --> 09:31.738
to break my spirit to live.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.609
I'm one of those people,

09:36.610 --> 09:39.345
I need complete silence.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.248
Just complete silence.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.351
I just close the
curtains and everything,

09:45.352 --> 09:47.219
the drapes, the windows.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.022
Everybody shut the fuck up.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.860
I pull the covers up and I
just look around for sounds.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.729
You shut up.

09:58.632 --> 10:02.770
And he's snoring and it's
like Chinese water torture.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.932
You know how they they
kill you one drop at a time

10:07.440 --> 10:10.176
with Chinese water torture.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.679
You know it's like, drip,

10:12.680 --> 10:14.914
drip, well that's it.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.357
Sometimes he waits till it's
the middle of the night,

10:25.358 --> 10:28.795
right, the middle of the night,

10:28.796 --> 10:31.931
and it sounds like he's
starting an '84 Cutlass Ciera.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.068
Just out of nowhere...

10:39.673 --> 10:43.142
What was that?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.012
You're gonna
flood the engine.

10:47.948 --> 10:52.685
Then a maimed elephant
has come into the room.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.960
What end did that come out of?

11:09.302 --> 11:12.905
This is my soul mate?

11:17.144 --> 11:21.080
What kind of jacked
up soul do I have?

11:21.081 --> 11:23.583
This.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.653
A friend of mine said,

11:27.654 --> 11:29.655
"You gotta take him to a
doctor."

11:29.656 --> 11:31.991
I said, "I gotta take
him to a mechanic."

11:35.829 --> 11:37.629
And she goes, "No he
needs a special pillow."

11:37.630 --> 11:40.499
And I was like, "Genius 'cause
then I could just put it"

11:40.500 --> 11:42.735
"over his face."

11:46.974 --> 11:49.141
Do you know what's
even more frightening?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.944
Getting woken up in
the middle of the night

11:51.945 --> 11:56.115
by hot four year old breath.

11:58.085 --> 12:02.154
Just...

12:02.155 --> 12:04.356
No sound, no words, just...

12:06.960 --> 12:09.461
It's a different consistency

12:09.462 --> 12:11.831
than regular human breath.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.169
And all you hear is,

12:17.170 --> 12:19.872
"I want a banana."

12:23.743 --> 12:25.177
So I nudge my husband,

12:25.178 --> 12:27.213
"Go get the kid a banana."

12:30.350 --> 12:34.120
My husband said if his
snoring is bothering me,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.222
I should go get some ear plugs.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.658
Oh this is my problem?

12:39.659 --> 12:43.129
I have to go get the ear plugs.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.464
So I went down to the drugstore,

12:45.465 --> 12:48.100
I bought a bag of ear plugs

12:48.101 --> 12:51.637
and then later that night

12:51.638 --> 12:54.041
I shove the bag down his throat.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.179
So then he goes,

13:00.180 --> 13:01.948
"Alright, alright,
alright, okay."

13:01.949 --> 13:04.450
"Let's get a sound machine."

13:04.451 --> 13:07.719
A sound machine?

13:07.720 --> 13:11.757
The word sound is
in your solution.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.861
I want zero sound.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.463
And he said, "No, no it's
a white noise machine."

13:17.464 --> 13:20.532
I said, "You're a
white noise machine."

13:20.533 --> 13:25.371
"You're white and
you're making noise."

13:29.209 --> 13:30.342
He bought it anyway.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.811
He went and got one.
He set it to amazon.

13:32.812 --> 13:38.084
Have you guys ever
been to the amazon?

13:38.085 --> 13:40.519
It's not a peaceful place.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.754
It starts off nice right?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.490
It starts off it's like...

13:47.494 --> 13:50.362
and then it takes
a terrible turn.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.665
Then poachers have arrived,

13:53.666 --> 13:55.767
because out of nowhere...

13:59.339 --> 14:01.941
Somebody is fisting
a baby gorilla.

14:07.547 --> 14:11.017
Next to the bed he can
sleep with a clock.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.886
With a clock, who can
sleep with a clock.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.688
Tick, tick, tick, tick,

14:16.689 --> 14:17.689
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick

14:17.690 --> 14:19.391
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.460
All night long, it's
like the Hurt Locker.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.462
Tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick

14:23.463 --> 14:24.997
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.899
How do you sleep with
a bomb next to you?

14:26.900 --> 14:29.735
Tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick

14:29.736 --> 14:31.537
tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.205
And then a fan over our heads.

14:38.946 --> 14:43.382
It could fall down
and murder you.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.425
Tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.331
"I want a banana."

15:13.280 --> 15:17.583
* There's a miracle
inside of me *

15:22.755 --> 15:25.057
When I became a parent,

15:25.058 --> 15:28.260
I realized how little my
parents cared about me.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.733
And you know it's true.
You know it's true.

15:34.734 --> 15:39.371
Here's what happened,
we found out that our kid

15:39.372 --> 15:43.375
has the peanut allergy. Right,
and it's a terrible one, right.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.476
So okay.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.512
I am a immigrant,

15:46.513 --> 15:50.449
so I had to call my
crazy soviet parents,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.584
who are from the USSR.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.021
You guys know what
the old people do.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.326
This young lady, you have no
idea what I'm talking about.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.861
Ah you don't know what Russia

16:02.862 --> 16:05.464
was communist.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.133
Must get moose and squirrel!

16:07.134 --> 16:08.434
Any of this?

16:09.569 --> 16:10.836
You don't know right.

16:10.837 --> 16:14.273
Do you know? No.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.079
They're from the old country.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.480
I call my mom and I go,

16:21.481 --> 16:23.849
"Mom I'm in a doctor's
office, I need to know,"

16:23.850 --> 16:25.651
when I was little
back in Russia,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.653
"did I have any allergies?"

16:27.654 --> 16:29.621
And she said,

16:29.622 --> 16:31.358
"Who knows?"

16:35.395 --> 16:37.196
What do you mean who knows?

16:37.197 --> 16:39.998
You that's your job.

16:39.999 --> 16:44.337
"We don't pay attention to
these things in Russia."

16:46.339 --> 16:49.708
"That's only in this
country, allergies,

16:49.709 --> 16:54.546
allergies, allergies."

16:54.547 --> 16:57.349
"If I wait in line seven
hours for peanuts,

16:57.350 --> 17:03.322
you're going to
have these peanuts."

17:08.528 --> 17:09.994
I remember asking my dad once

17:09.996 --> 17:12.498
if I ever had the
chicken pox and he said,

17:12.499 --> 17:16.367
"One day you stopped breathing."

17:23.242 --> 17:25.042
I don't think that's
the chicken pox.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.813
"This is what we call
chicken pox in Russia."

17:28.481 --> 17:31.817
You just stop breathing.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.620
She has chicken pox.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.956
Russians are aggressive people.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.326
They're very aggressive yet,

17:40.327 --> 17:41.760
I've had people ask my parents,

17:41.761 --> 17:44.130
"Where do you think Kira gets
her sense of humor from?"

17:44.131 --> 17:46.698
And my parents go,

17:46.699 --> 17:49.168
"From me, I'm very funny."

17:52.105 --> 17:56.242
You're frightening
when you say that.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.776
"I am very funny."

18:01.781 --> 18:04.450
What's the first
thing you think of

18:04.451 --> 18:05.951
when you think of Russians?

18:05.952 --> 18:07.886
What, just yell it
out the first thing?

18:07.887 --> 18:09.521
- Vodka.
- Someone said hookers,

18:09.522 --> 18:11.457
that's not nice.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.892
That wasn't nice.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.228
Vodka, that's right, vodka.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.730
And you know what,
that is a stereotype

18:18.731 --> 18:20.466
for a reason,
because they're lunatics.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.434
They're obsessed with vodka.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.070
Obsessed.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.838
Right, but I'm not
much of a drinker

18:26.839 --> 18:28.440
so I'm an embarrassment
to my family.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.612
And we're at a party once right
and they start lining up.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.414
They start lining
up the shot glasses.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.283
It's that time of night right.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.251
Lining them up right.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.586
Vodka, vodka, vodka,
vodka, vodka, vodka,

18:40.587 --> 18:42.120
vodka, vodka,
vodka, vodka, vodka.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.989
They get to mine and I
very politely, I said,

18:43.990 --> 18:45.724
"Oh no thank you."

18:45.725 --> 18:49.195
My mom freaks out,
"What's wrong with you?"

18:49.196 --> 18:52.798
"You are embarrassing
me at party."

18:52.799 --> 18:54.733
I'm eight.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.574
And I have school tomorrow.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.146
And I'm your ride home.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.785
I've just never been
much of a drinker,

19:13.786 --> 19:16.222
but I have been wine tasting.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.190
I went wine tasting.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.227
We have some family
that own a vineyard.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.861
It's amazing.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.062
If you ever go to
Nappa, it's called.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.665
Potland Vineyard
and it's beautiful.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.100
You go up into the mountains.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.170
It's on this Tuscan
estate, it's classy right.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.006
You drive over, there's
all these expensive cars.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.476
Everyone's dripping in jewelry.

19:37.477 --> 19:41.547
You walk in there's a sommelier

19:41.548 --> 19:44.583
and then he asks you
what you'd like to try.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.585
And then you tell
him your selection

19:46.586 --> 19:48.254
and then he says, "Wonderful."

19:48.255 --> 19:51.590
"I'll go pour it
from the bunghole."

19:53.726 --> 19:57.563
That's what they call the hole

19:57.564 --> 20:01.233
that they pour the wine from.

20:01.234 --> 20:04.670
The bunghole.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.506
Can you find another word?

20:07.507 --> 20:12.644
You drove here in a Ferrari.

20:12.645 --> 20:17.616
I would take anal
spout over that.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.851
I will take tucus tunnel.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.754
Anything else.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.657
I will take a port from
the junk in my trunk.

20:25.658 --> 20:29.528
Anything but bunghole.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.965

going to say a city,

21:00.660 --> 21:02.661
Chocolatechicklie.
Oh okay, nobody knows

21:02.662 --> 21:06.632

all love to not make money.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.910

21:42.969 --> 21:45.671
Welcome to my charity storage.

I just peed.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.318
I just peed a little bit.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.822
I can't do that.

Anybody got me beat?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.884
- Through the lobby,
alright me and you.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.719
We're going to vagina
wrestle after the show.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.022
Outside.

23:44.023 --> 23:47.993
Whoever wins goes
up against twinsies.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.265
Wow, 10'4 yeah.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.035
First question I get is,
did you have a c-section?

23:57.036 --> 23:59.304
And then I say no

23:59.305 --> 24:00.772
and then the
follow-up question is,

24:00.773 --> 24:03.742
well then how did you have him?

24:09.415 --> 24:11.717
Anally.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.855
Obamacare!

24:24.864 --> 24:27.032
Yeah.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.167
10 pounds.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.936
Did you do the drugs?

24:30.937 --> 24:33.304
You do drugs?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.006
Drugs yeah, what'd you do?

24:35.007 --> 24:37.442
Meth, cocaine, what did you do?

24:37.443 --> 24:40.278
All of it right?
Might as well drop some

24:40.279 --> 24:42.848
acid and see some colors.

24:42.849 --> 24:46.952
I tried not to, I tried not to.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.720
I tried to hold out
as long as I could.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.589
Many, many hours of no drugs

24:50.590 --> 24:53.491
because you know I
live in Los Angeles,

24:53.492 --> 24:56.628
where everyone so
crunchy granola.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.898
And everyone's like
you don't need drugs,

24:59.899 --> 25:01.533
all you need to do
is take a deep...

25:03.803 --> 25:05.637
cleansing breath.

25:05.638 --> 25:09.007
Connect to the ground
through your toes.

25:09.008 --> 25:14.613
Feel the power of
the sun's rays.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.948
Shut up!

25:16.949 --> 25:18.984
When I saw that epidural
come in the room,

25:18.985 --> 25:20.752
I was like put it in my eye!

25:22.955 --> 25:27.793
Just put it directly
in my cornea.

25:27.794 --> 25:32.097
And they were like, "No,
no it goes in your back."

25:32.098 --> 25:34.165
I said, "It goes in my
mouth like a Caprisun."

25:34.166 --> 25:38.804
And I drank it like a juicebox.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.909
What is this tropical
breeze flavor?

25:43.910 --> 25:45.744
This is amazing.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.446
My epidural wore off.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.248
Yeah, I know.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.818
And my crazy Soviet mother

25:52.819 --> 25:56.354
is criticizing me.

25:56.355 --> 26:03.795
"Oh you need epidural?"

26:05.665 --> 26:08.600
She's comparing everything
that I'm going through

26:08.601 --> 26:10.168
in modern day America

26:10.169 --> 26:12.037
with what she went through

26:12.038 --> 26:16.341
in the USSR.

26:16.342 --> 26:20.411
"Oh excuse me the
baby hurt you okay."

26:20.412 --> 26:24.349
"In Russia we don't
have epidural."

26:24.350 --> 26:26.752
"In Russia you know
what they give you?"

26:26.753 --> 26:28.086
"Punch you in face."

26:30.389 --> 26:34.259
I told my husband I go,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.895
"I need more, I need
more of the drugs."

26:36.896 --> 26:42.501
And he goes, "There
a little expensive."

26:45.504 --> 26:50.308
I said, "You go find a
groupon for epidurals."

26:58.685 --> 27:03.088
My mom was criticizing
everything I was going through.

27:03.089 --> 27:09.260
"Oh you have baby
in hospital, okay."

27:09.261 --> 27:12.430
"I have baby on the bus,

27:12.431 --> 27:14.132
and I am driving this bus."

27:19.471 --> 27:22.540
You have to be like really
chill with a pregnant woman.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.944
Right because during labor
you just get so angry.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.412
Did you yell at?

27:27.413 --> 27:29.080
Is this your baby
daddy over here?

27:29.081 --> 27:31.016
Yeah, yeah?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.184
You yelled at him right?

27:33.185 --> 27:34.452
I was so, all these hormones,

27:34.453 --> 27:36.087
and I was like
yelling at my husband.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.891
"You, you did this to me!"

27:39.892 --> 27:46.197
Well I said, "I'm pretty
sure, you did this."

27:46.198 --> 27:49.301
"Like 99% sure."

27:52.739 --> 27:55.373
I did yell at him,
here's what happened.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.509
I did yell at him, I did.
Here's what he did, he was

27:58.510 --> 28:02.080
being very supportive and nice.
He was all up in my face right.

28:02.081 --> 28:06.918
You're doing great.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.820
All up in my nose holes.

28:08.821 --> 28:12.657
I love you.

28:12.658 --> 28:15.460
Push.

28:15.461 --> 28:18.363
And I stopped everything,
I looked up at him

28:18.364 --> 28:20.899
and I said, "You get a mint."

28:28.307 --> 28:31.843
How sad that my husband's
breath hurts more

28:31.844 --> 28:34.412
than having a baby.

28:42.454 --> 28:46.091
What was that first
month like back for you?

28:46.092 --> 28:47.458
What was that first month?

28:47.459 --> 28:48.827
It's a blur right.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.862
You don't do anything human.

28:50.863 --> 28:53.698
You don't eat normally,
none of this gets clean.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.566
You just, you just...

28:59.405 --> 29:01.572
What did your nipples look like?

29:01.573 --> 29:04.109
Let me seem them real quick.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.211
Let me see them.

29:06.212 --> 29:11.582
My nipples look like
angry junkyard dogs.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.820
That have been
chained up to a fence.

29:14.821 --> 29:19.958
You know junkyard dogs always
have like one eye split open

29:19.959 --> 29:22.160
and they're all foaming out.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.932
They're just angry
and aggressive.

29:30.269 --> 29:34.605
And I had to wear a diaper.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.474
I'm not ashamed to tell it.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.913
I had a big baby, I wasn't
allowed on the furniture.

29:43.415 --> 29:46.918
I had to wear a
diaper for a month,

29:46.919 --> 29:50.421
two months, for a month.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.825
Do you know what that
does psychologically

29:53.826 --> 29:57.863
to an adult when you
have to wear a diaper?

29:57.864 --> 30:01.299
In your own house just
walking down the hallway

30:01.300 --> 30:04.169
at 3 o'clock in the
morning in a diaper.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.770
Just...

30:07.173 --> 30:09.340
With no shirt on,
why where a shirt?

30:09.341 --> 30:11.142
Why, why, why, why, why?

30:11.143 --> 30:15.480
Why?

30:15.481 --> 30:19.284
This is open 24/7, why?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.386
Why wear a shirt?

30:21.387 --> 30:24.155
Just boobs flapping
from side to side.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.157
I'm in a diaper
like a crackhead.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.394
Just...

30:36.002 --> 30:38.736
I want some sleep, ha ha ha.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.439
Do a little crackhead
dance, ha, ha, ha.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.075
Gimme some sleep.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.779
If you see a crackhead
walking around the streets

30:48.780 --> 30:52.050
of Hollywood, don't judge her
she

30:52.051 --> 30:56.454
could've just had a baby.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.124
I see my husband at
the end of the hallway.

30:59.125 --> 31:02.127
He sees me and I'm like,
"Ha ha ha"

31:02.128 --> 31:05.863
"I will give you a quickie, if you
give me 20 minutes of sleep."

31:05.864 --> 31:09.935
I don't know if any
of the men in here

31:09.936 --> 31:14.172
have ever been serviced
by a woman in a diaper.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.982
Everyone is crying
in that situation.

31:24.917 --> 31:28.120
Everyone is crying.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.225
As a parent though,

31:34.226 --> 31:38.729
I really do feel like you can't
do anything right sometimes.

31:38.730 --> 31:43.568
So many people just
judge you on everything.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.436
If your kid starts screaming

31:45.437 --> 31:47.638
in the middle of a
department store,

31:47.639 --> 31:50.708
people are like immediately,

31:50.709 --> 31:52.743
"Oh my God control your child."

31:52.744 --> 31:56.982
But if you yell at your kid
because they're screaming

31:56.983 --> 32:00.418
in a department store.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.154
"Get over here, don't touch
that."

32:03.155 --> 32:04.722
"Stop what you're doing."

32:04.723 --> 32:08.994
"Oh my God can't you
just let him be a kid?"

32:08.995 --> 32:11.696
You can never win ever.

32:11.697 --> 32:15.166
People criticize you
about everything.

32:15.167 --> 32:20.038
Look, we got our son
circumcised.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.572
Hold on, relax, settle down.

32:21.573 --> 32:25.243
Settle down, everybody relax.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.212
We waited until he was four.

32:27.213 --> 32:29.280
No...

32:31.250 --> 32:33.251
No, no we got him circumcised.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.486
Look that's not for everyone,

32:35.487 --> 32:37.822
but I had this one
mother freak out on me,

32:37.823 --> 32:40.759
"How could you mutilate
your child like that?"

32:45.364 --> 32:47.665
Well I didn't do
it with my teeth.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.203
First of all, how
does it effect you,

32:52.204 --> 32:53.638
what I do with my kid?

32:53.639 --> 32:56.607
Right, how does it effect you?

32:56.608 --> 32:59.610
Unless my kid is
taking his foreskin

32:59.611 --> 33:04.715
and beating you upon the face.

33:04.716 --> 33:07.018
It doesn't effect you at all.

33:07.019 --> 33:10.221
Zero.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.390
See we were hit, right.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.192
You guys, were you
guys hit as kids?

33:14.193 --> 33:18.996
Poland you were for sure hit.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.137
But you know people don't,

33:26.138 --> 33:28.639
you're not allowed to
hit your kid in public.

33:33.279 --> 33:34.779
Look here's the thing,

33:34.780 --> 33:37.282
I, we don't hit our kid right?

33:37.283 --> 33:40.518
But sometimes...

33:40.519 --> 33:44.255
Sometimes you wanna.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.656
We're at the park right,

33:45.657 --> 33:47.158
and he's throwing
sand in your face

33:47.159 --> 33:48.826
and he won't stop.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.095
You've asked him
a million times,

33:50.096 --> 33:51.662
"Stop throwing sand."

33:51.663 --> 33:53.298
You can't hit him.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.233
I can't hit my kid,

33:55.234 --> 34:00.206
but there's no reason
why you people can't hit.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.278
I want to create an app.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.616
Much like Uber.

34:14.453 --> 34:17.822
Look I'm going to
pay you for it.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.757
It's not a non-profit.

34:22.628 --> 34:26.231
I'm gonna pay you. But
let's say my kid

34:26.232 --> 34:28.799
is acting up right,
I just pull up the app okay

34:28.800 --> 34:31.702
and I'm like a little
blue dot on a map alright?

34:31.703 --> 34:34.438
And much like Uber
cars that are circling

34:34.440 --> 34:38.208
around your location,

34:38.210 --> 34:42.713
instead of a car it's
just a big red hand.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.382
All the red hands in your area

34:45.384 --> 34:48.018
and then whoever's closest,

34:48.018 --> 34:50.255
you just come out of the bushes

34:50.255 --> 34:52.389
and just BAA!

34:59.531 --> 35:00.831
Right?

35:02.401 --> 35:04.535
Is that a good idea?

35:04.536 --> 35:07.672
And then I look at
my kid and I go,

35:07.673 --> 35:09.607
"What happened?"

35:09.608 --> 35:13.110
And he's confused and I'm like,

35:13.111 --> 35:16.481
"Mommy didn't do that,
so we're okay right?"

35:16.482 --> 35:20.418
"So we're okay."

35:20.419 --> 35:22.052
It teaches him to not act up

35:22.053 --> 35:24.155
and also be scared of strangers.

35:28.194 --> 35:31.762
My kid started hitting me
when he was two years old

35:31.763 --> 35:35.233
out of nowhere, just
sometimes with his hand.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.501
Just pop!

35:36.502 --> 35:39.837
Like a pimp, just... pop!

35:39.838 --> 35:43.174
Bitch where's my Legos?

35:47.813 --> 35:52.517
Sometimes he would
use his giraffe,

35:52.518 --> 35:53.751
like a little stuffed giraffe

35:53.752 --> 35:56.454
that he loves so much.

35:56.455 --> 36:00.124
He would just take me and
he would just pop me with it

36:00.125 --> 36:03.127
and I didn't know what
to do, I was shocked.

36:03.128 --> 36:07.365
I turned into a like
Tony Soprano mafia guy.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.469
All of a sudden I started
threatening his giraffe.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.739
I was like, "You know"

36:14.740 --> 36:18.309
"it'd be a shame if something
were to happen to..."

36:23.549 --> 36:25.083
Accidents happen.

36:26.552 --> 36:31.456
Maybe the giraffe
knows too much.

36:31.457 --> 36:34.559
Take him for a long ride.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.262
He would still do it,
just hit me in the face

36:37.263 --> 36:40.097
with his giraffe,
just hit me yeah.

36:40.098 --> 36:43.468
So I was like I'm gonna
cut the giraffe's head off

36:43.469 --> 36:46.371
and put it in his crib
to send him a message.

36:47.773 --> 36:50.341
You don't mess with Cosa Nostra.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.081
He would freak out

36:57.082 --> 36:58.949
and just throw things at me.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.586
We were once in the
car driving right.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.988
We're on the freeway

37:03.989 --> 37:07.692
and he's buckled up in
his 15 point harness.

37:12.664 --> 37:17.335
He has bubble wrap, a
helmet, three goats.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.003
It's very safe.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.172
He sees a balloon,
he sees a balloon

37:22.173 --> 37:25.610
just fly, fly across in the sky.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.011
Right, he sees a balloon

37:27.012 --> 37:30.381
and he says to
me, "Oh hey mommy",

37:30.382 --> 37:32.283
I want that balloon."

37:34.886 --> 37:38.289
Okay you don't know
how balloons work.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.758
That balloon is gone,
it's in the sky.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.827
It's...

37:42.828 --> 37:44.962
Okay I guess I have
to explain balloons.

37:44.963 --> 37:48.265
So a balloon, it's
gone, it's in the sky.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.734
It's floating away.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.136
And he literally
cleared his throat

37:52.137 --> 37:54.238
as if to say I don't
think you heard me.

37:55.974 --> 37:58.142
"I want that balloon!"

37:58.143 --> 38:01.379
And he starts
screaming and yelling

38:01.380 --> 38:03.614
and like shaking his legs
and kicking everything,

38:03.615 --> 38:05.950
the console, he's like,

38:05.951 --> 38:08.218
"I want that balloon!"

38:08.219 --> 38:10.120
And I'm just like, you don't
under-

38:10.121 --> 38:12.723
I gotta tell you
how balloons work.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.526
Listen to mommy.

38:15.527 --> 38:18.262
There was another little boy.

38:18.263 --> 38:19.764
His mommy said, "Don't let
go of that fucking balloon."

38:19.765 --> 38:22.767
And he didn't listen to
his mommy and he let go.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.302
And now the balloon is gone.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.942
And I was like so shut
up about the balloon!

38:31.943 --> 38:35.413
He takes his little penguin
that he loves so much

38:35.414 --> 38:39.450
and he throws it at
the back of my head.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.286
I hulk out immediately.

38:44.222 --> 38:46.357
I'm not kidding you,
all my clothes flew off.

38:46.358 --> 38:49.560
I was wearing shorts
from the '70s.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.132
The penguin fell in my lap.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.334
I unrolled the window,
unrolled the window.

38:57.335 --> 39:02.006
I held the penguin
out the car window,

39:02.007 --> 39:05.510
like I'm Suge Knight.

39:07.312 --> 39:10.114
We're just driving along
and the penguin is shaking

39:10.115 --> 39:13.551
and the penguins like,
"Bring me back inside the car."

39:13.552 --> 39:17.955
And he's screaming,
"No, not penguino."

39:17.956 --> 39:20.391
And I was like, "Yes penguino!"

39:22.594 --> 39:25.329
What is that?

39:25.330 --> 39:27.031
I need to namaste.

39:29.401 --> 39:32.803
I was in a bathroom stall,
in a public restroom

39:32.804 --> 39:35.473
and someone walked in on me.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.274
Just walked in, right?

39:37.275 --> 39:39.477
Which happens.
Doesn't happen to

39:39.478 --> 39:42.212
dudes a lot, right.
Unless you're republican.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.514
But...

39:45.417 --> 39:48.486
Senator...

39:51.557 --> 39:53.491
Settle down Orange County.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.360
It happens to women though.

39:56.361 --> 39:58.228
You've been walked
in on right ladies?

39:58.229 --> 39:59.430
Or you walk in on someone.
It's embarrassing

39:59.431 --> 40:01.966
and no one likes it,
but it happens.

40:01.967 --> 40:05.135
But this was in a
huge bathroom stall.

40:05.136 --> 40:08.639
Trousers come down.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.777
Right when they come
down, the door swings open

40:12.778 --> 40:14.645
and this woman just opens it

40:14.646 --> 40:17.582
and this is what she does,
this was her reaction,

40:17.583 --> 40:18.949
"No!"

40:24.422 --> 40:27.191
What'd you mean no?

40:27.192 --> 40:29.894
Who screams that? "No!"

40:29.895 --> 40:32.196
As if she was channeling her.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.899
YMCA women's self
defense course.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.768
No!

40:37.769 --> 40:39.970
No!

40:39.971 --> 40:43.141
And she ran away,
she scurried away.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.277
Left the door wide open.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.013
Now I...

40:54.786 --> 40:56.086
have five pairs of spanks on.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.826
So now I have to

41:01.827 --> 41:06.230
get to the front
right here, right.

41:06.231 --> 41:09.934
Get to the front and I
have to now close the door.

41:09.935 --> 41:14.905
I look out, there's
a line of women.

41:14.906 --> 41:18.142
There's a line just
standing there.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.978
They just witnessed
a woman open a door,

41:20.979 --> 41:24.015
scream "No!" and run away,

41:25.016 --> 41:27.518
and no one is concerned?

41:32.357 --> 41:34.324
So I look at them and I go,

41:34.325 --> 41:37.795
"Come on she overreacted
a little bit, right?"

41:37.796 --> 41:39.630
They're silent, they're silent.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.699
My feelings were hurt.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.000
I'll be honest with you,
they were legitimately hurt.

41:43.001 --> 41:46.837
I close the door and I
was like really upset

41:46.838 --> 41:48.138
about her reaction.

41:48.139 --> 41:50.941
And then I realize, well
that's probably better

41:50.942 --> 41:53.911
than her swinging the
door open and going,

41:53.912 --> 41:57.081
"Ooooh!"

41:59.317 --> 42:03.453
People are crazy,
people are crazy.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.155
I've been trying to eat healthy,

42:05.156 --> 42:07.157
so I've been going
to salad bars, right.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.993
I don't know if
you guys ever go.

42:08.994 --> 42:11.128
Look, I'm not a germophobe.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.631
I know some people don't
like to go to salad bars,

42:13.632 --> 42:16.200
but I enjoy them,

42:16.201 --> 42:17.868
I think they're a nice
healthy alternative.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.504
They have that sneeze guard.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.707
The sneeze guard is
supposed to help us.

42:22.708 --> 42:27.678
Does anybody think this
really helps us at all?

42:27.679 --> 42:29.614
No not really.

42:29.615 --> 42:33.884
The sneeze guard, at this
one specific place I went to,

42:33.885 --> 42:35.519
it came right down
to your trachea.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.789
Just right...

42:38.790 --> 42:40.257
and I was there at the salad bar

42:40.258 --> 42:44.061
and if you wanted to
reach like five rows deep

42:44.062 --> 42:46.831
to the pepperchinies.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.199
The sneeze guard would just...

42:53.504 --> 42:57.708
There was this man next to
me, also at the salad bar,

42:57.709 --> 42:59.209
you know, nice man.

42:59.210 --> 43:01.178
He was a smaller guy,

43:01.179 --> 43:03.013
not small like his
own show on TLC small,

43:03.014 --> 43:04.214
but just...

43:06.351 --> 43:07.918
Not that kind, but
you know what I mean,

43:07.919 --> 43:09.754
but he was just a shorter man.

43:09.755 --> 43:11.889
Like he better have money and...

43:13.224 --> 43:15.059
He was...

43:15.060 --> 43:17.161
And he was also trying
to reach something

43:17.162 --> 43:18.096
all the way in the back,

43:18.097 --> 43:20.898
but this guy he was determined.

43:20.899 --> 43:23.769
He climbed up into
the salad bar.

43:26.537 --> 43:30.240
He had his crotch
in the croutons

43:30.241 --> 43:33.244
and just had his junk,
just right in the beets.

43:35.881 --> 43:36.948
Just right...

43:38.116 --> 43:39.283
He climbed into,

43:39.284 --> 43:43.320
he put his taint
in the tomatoes.

43:43.321 --> 43:44.321
Do you understand?

43:45.891 --> 43:46.924
To reach...

43:46.925 --> 43:48.492
To reach that and I said,

43:48.493 --> 43:51.762
"Sir do you want me
to get those for you?"

43:51.763 --> 43:57.067
And as he's dry
humping the eggs,

43:57.068 --> 43:58.770
Just...

44:00.005 --> 44:01.939
He's reaching.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.908
I'm just saying
sneeze guard is okay,

44:03.909 --> 44:05.509
but we also need some
sort of ball catch.

44:08.847 --> 44:11.148
I'm more concerned
about the balls

44:11.149 --> 44:14.852
in my cucumbers than
a little head cold.

44:23.929 --> 44:26.563
If I have one more
woman come up to me

44:26.564 --> 44:33.670
and tell me that
her dog is her baby,

44:33.671 --> 44:36.974
I will kick her baby.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.945
Look I love dogs,

44:40.946 --> 44:43.113
I grew up with dogs we
had dogs, we had dogs.

44:43.114 --> 44:46.483
I mean they were fed
by Russians so...

44:46.484 --> 44:49.486
We had Dobermans, Dobermans.

44:49.487 --> 44:52.089
They're supposed
to be proud dogs

44:52.090 --> 44:53.657
with like big barrel
chest and they're,

44:53.658 --> 44:56.861
you know what I mean,
like really strong

44:56.862 --> 44:58.228
and they're protective dogs.

44:59.931 --> 45:03.734
These dogs were so fat

45:03.735 --> 45:05.635
that if anyone ever
broke into our house,

45:05.636 --> 45:08.372
I would have to pick the dog up

45:08.373 --> 45:10.440
and throw it at the intruder.

45:10.441 --> 45:14.544
So don't get me
wrong I love dogs,

45:14.545 --> 45:20.117
but your dog is not your baby.

45:20.118 --> 45:22.358
Then your baby's face is giving
me a Pap Smear right now.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.060
Don't call your dog your baby.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.495
I love dogs, but when people,

45:31.496 --> 45:34.198
oh my God these women.

45:34.199 --> 45:36.166
My dog that's my fur baby.

45:36.167 --> 45:41.171
It's my fur baby,
that's my fur baby.

45:41.172 --> 45:43.740
That is so disrespectful
to Armenians.

45:50.548 --> 45:55.019
Please your dog
is not your baby.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.022
And then she proceeds to tie
her baby around a parking meter

45:58.023 --> 46:01.291
and go into a coffee shop.

46:01.292 --> 46:04.795
I would love to tie my kid
around a parking meter.

46:07.465 --> 46:09.399
Was it romantic when
he proposed to you?

46:09.400 --> 46:12.002
Was it romantic?

46:12.003 --> 46:14.004
Yeah, what did he do?

46:14.005 --> 46:16.140
Oh my gosh, what did he do?

46:16.141 --> 46:18.876
What happened?

46:18.877 --> 46:20.945
He gave you a ring?

46:20.946 --> 46:22.779
Wow, okay.

46:23.749 --> 46:25.950
Okay that was it?

46:25.951 --> 46:27.684
He had a song on the radio?

46:27.685 --> 46:29.586
A song on the radio,
what'd you mean?

46:29.587 --> 46:32.222
Are you a musician sir?

46:32.223 --> 46:34.691
No.

46:34.692 --> 46:37.461
He just played the radio for you

46:37.462 --> 46:40.931
and told you he wrote that song.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.535
He did a request on the radio.

46:45.536 --> 46:48.105
Oh my God you guys got
married in the '80s.

46:51.376 --> 46:56.113
That is so romantic.

46:56.114 --> 46:59.549
Yeah I remember
radios, I remember.

46:59.550 --> 47:01.785
I would listen to it
while reading my newspaper

47:01.786 --> 47:04.088
and using a
payphone, I remember.

47:05.991 --> 47:07.624
I remember radios.

47:07.625 --> 47:10.394
That was so sweet,
so were you crying?

47:10.395 --> 47:11.828
Were you like all emotional?

47:11.829 --> 47:14.398
No you weren't, you were angry.

47:14.399 --> 47:16.833
You were angry about it, yeah.

47:16.834 --> 47:20.470
My husband, very romantic
when he proposed.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.539
I was peeing on a stick.

47:26.111 --> 47:31.415
And he said, "I have a question
for you in three minutes."

47:33.784 --> 47:36.754
"Or I don't have a question
for you in three minutes."

47:40.191 --> 47:44.028
We were actually in Australia.

47:44.029 --> 47:46.897
We were in Australia

47:46.898 --> 47:48.498
and I don't know if you guys
have ever been to Sydney,

47:48.499 --> 47:51.101
but they have these
amazing cliffs.

47:51.102 --> 47:54.271
Amazing cliffs in Sydney

47:54.272 --> 47:55.639
and we were at those
cliffs and you just watch

47:55.640 --> 47:58.775
the boats coming in,
the water's there,

47:58.776 --> 48:01.845
and it's so beautiful,
so romantic.

48:01.846 --> 48:06.016
And he proposed and this woman
walks over right afterwards

48:06.017 --> 48:11.255
and she says, "Oh did you
two just get engaged?"

48:11.256 --> 48:12.756
And we said, "Yeah."

48:12.757 --> 48:16.660
And she said, "Oh this is
where people commit suicide."

48:21.566 --> 48:24.834
And we were stunned,
we were silent.

48:24.835 --> 48:26.937
We didn't know what to say,

48:26.938 --> 48:29.006
so she thought maybe
we didn't hear her.

48:29.007 --> 48:31.008
So she repeated it.

48:31.009 --> 48:36.313
"This is where people
kill themselves!"

48:36.314 --> 48:37.514
So we pushed her.

48:42.887 --> 48:46.190
I don't know maybe
she was asking us.

48:50.528 --> 48:52.462
I am Jewish and my
husband's family is not.

48:52.463 --> 48:55.900
They are angry that I am Jewish.

48:58.970 --> 49:02.572
My father-in-law is a
little bit anti-semetic.

49:02.573 --> 49:06.476
Not a ton, not a ton.

49:06.477 --> 49:09.379
It's not like he's
like, "I hate Jews!"

49:09.380 --> 49:12.649
It's more like, "Jews..."

49:14.852 --> 49:17.587
Here's how I know,
here's how I know.

49:17.588 --> 49:19.723
He does these weird things.

49:19.724 --> 49:22.792
He gives me these
really weird presents.

49:25.230 --> 49:28.698
He gave me a gift, this is
a real gift not a gag gift,

49:28.699 --> 49:31.368
a little doll that when
you push the doll's hand,

49:31.369 --> 49:35.372
it starts to sing and dance.

49:35.373 --> 49:38.208
Have you guys ever seen these?

49:38.209 --> 49:40.377
Sometimes they have a
Santa that starts to go,

49:40.378 --> 49:42.546
* Jingle bells
You guys have seen these?

49:42.547 --> 49:45.082
He gave me a little Rabbi.

49:47.752 --> 49:50.120
A little Rabbi, a little Rabbi.

49:50.121 --> 49:53.523
You push the doll's hand
and it starts to go,

49:53.524 --> 49:56.060
* Hava nagila hava.

49:59.597 --> 50:05.602
That is so highly inappropriate.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.837
I can tell by some of
the silence over here.

50:07.838 --> 50:12.376
You guys are like what's
wrong Jew that's totally cool.

50:12.377 --> 50:14.211
No that's really not cool.

50:14.212 --> 50:15.879
What if my husband would
have married any other race

50:15.880 --> 50:17.947
or ethnicity or religion?

50:17.948 --> 50:21.451
What if he would have
married a Muslim girl

50:21.452 --> 50:23.487
and he gave her a doll.

50:23.488 --> 50:25.455
You push the doll's
hand, doll blows up.

50:31.496 --> 50:34.998
Do you see how
inappropriate that is?

50:38.669 --> 50:42.539
Yeah he blew up a picture of me

50:42.540 --> 50:45.309
and it was very disturbing.

50:45.310 --> 50:49.813
It was a couple Easters
ago at a Easter egg hunt

50:49.814 --> 50:52.716
and he said, "Hey kids",

50:52.717 --> 50:55.785
"one of the Easter eggs
has a dollar in it."

50:55.786 --> 51:01.691
And then he looked right
at me, right at me.

51:01.692 --> 51:04.394
So of course I said
to my four year old,

51:04.395 --> 51:06.531
I was like, "You go find it."

51:08.533 --> 51:12.402
Right, so my kid went and of
course my kid found the egg

51:12.403 --> 51:13.737
with the dollar in it.

51:13.738 --> 51:17.874
Cracks the egg open,
shows it to his grandpa.

51:17.875 --> 51:19.609
"Grandpa look I found it."

51:19.610 --> 51:21.745
And he starts taking pictures

51:21.746 --> 51:25.415
of my kid holding
up this dollar.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.319
Now I am behind my child

51:29.154 --> 51:32.822
in this crazy Jew-y stance

51:32.823 --> 51:39.663
with like my arms stretched out

51:39.664 --> 51:42.065
and I'm pointing at this dollar

51:42.066 --> 51:45.034
like "Moneyyy!"

51:45.035 --> 51:51.341
And I look like Gargamel
meets Golda Meir.

51:53.110 --> 51:56.613
And he took that picture
and he blew it up.

51:56.614 --> 52:01.551
Now again, by the
silence in the room,

52:01.552 --> 52:03.820
you guys are like whatever Jew,

52:03.821 --> 52:07.757
that's totally cool.

52:07.758 --> 52:11.428
I'm just trying to read books

52:11.429 --> 52:13.463
that's all I'm trying to do.

52:13.464 --> 52:14.631
Learn, learn, learn, learn.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.033
Learn how to be a better parent.

52:17.034 --> 52:19.035
Did you guys ever read
any parenting books?

52:19.036 --> 52:20.504
Did you guys?

52:20.505 --> 52:21.372
Yeah.

52:21.373 --> 52:22.572
Did they work?

52:22.573 --> 52:24.574
No, they're all lies right.

52:26.143 --> 52:31.515
I was reading a book when my
kid was three on tantrums.

52:31.516 --> 52:33.650
Tantrums because
for some reason,

52:33.651 --> 52:37.086
for a three year old,

52:37.087 --> 52:39.689
they just, they decide they're
going to lose their mind

52:39.690 --> 52:42.359
in grocery stores.

52:42.360 --> 52:45.161
Like somehow that's where
they have all agreed.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.897
They've gone to some sort
of secret baby meeting.

52:47.898 --> 52:49.999
Hey we'll see you next week.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.737
Hey don't forget, lose
your shit at Ralph's.

52:56.574 --> 52:58.141
Alright drive safe.

52:59.277 --> 53:01.845
So every time, every
time we're at a...

53:01.846 --> 53:05.782
Every time we're at a grocery
store he loses his mind.

53:05.783 --> 53:10.186
The other day we were
in a grocery store,

53:10.187 --> 53:11.755
in the check out and
he sees the candies

53:11.756 --> 53:14.558
all the candies
in the check out.

53:14.559 --> 53:16.893
Reese's Peanut
Butter Cups, right.

53:16.894 --> 53:20.264
Starts screaming,
"I want those!"

53:20.265 --> 53:21.998
And I'm like alright
dude settle down,

53:21.999 --> 53:24.167
you can't have those.

53:24.168 --> 53:25.535
Alright please,
everyone's staring.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.805
Everyone's staring please stop.

53:28.806 --> 53:31.408
"No I need those, I want those!"

53:31.409 --> 53:34.311
And now all eyes are on us

53:34.312 --> 53:36.913
and I hate when my kid
is having a tantrum

53:36.914 --> 53:39.383
and everyone is staring at us.

53:39.384 --> 53:41.618
So normally what I
do in that situation,

53:41.619 --> 53:44.954
is I will lean in
and speak to him

53:44.955 --> 53:48.692
in a lower satanic
register of my voice.

53:51.429 --> 53:53.597
You know something like,

53:53.598 --> 53:57.801
"You shut the hell up."

54:01.138 --> 54:04.774
Kids...

54:04.775 --> 54:07.944
"I swear to God you shut up
now."

54:08.747 --> 54:12.416
"You shut up."

54:15.786 --> 54:21.659
"I'll pay with my
debit card, oh my God."

54:23.361 --> 54:25.862
But I read in a book
you can't do that.

54:25.863 --> 54:28.097
There's a book out there called,

54:28.098 --> 54:29.799
'Happiest Toddler On The Block.'

54:29.800 --> 54:32.569
Do you guys know
about this book?

54:32.570 --> 54:34.003
This is a real book

54:34.004 --> 54:36.039
and it says when
you're kid is screaming

54:36.040 --> 54:38.708
and yelling, and
having a tantrum,

54:38.709 --> 54:42.178
you have to also scream
and yell the same thing

54:42.179 --> 54:47.484
that they're yelling
at the same level.

54:47.485 --> 54:49.619
Oh good now you have two
people losing their mind

54:49.620 --> 54:52.422
at Ralph's.

54:52.423 --> 54:54.023
So I tried it, I tried
it this one time.

54:54.024 --> 54:56.793
I was like alright
I'm going to try it.

54:56.794 --> 54:58.395
I said, "Hey you
can't have those."

54:58.396 --> 55:00.630
"Alright you're not
allowed to have peanuts."

55:00.631 --> 55:02.799
"You're allergic to peanuts."

55:02.800 --> 55:06.470
And now he's screaming,
"But I want peanuts!"

55:09.707 --> 55:11.908
Which is a word

55:11.909 --> 55:15.745
that a three year old
can't pronounce correctly.

55:22.753 --> 55:26.990
So in reality he's screaming,

55:26.991 --> 55:31.061
"I want penis!"

55:33.898 --> 55:36.000
And now I have to yell,

55:41.572 --> 55:44.541
"I know you want penis."

55:44.542 --> 55:47.911
"Mommy wants penis too."

55:52.116 --> 55:56.520
"We can't have penis it
makes our throat close up."

55:56.521 --> 55:58.154
Thank you so much everybody.

55:58.155 --> 56:01.391
I really appreciate
it, thank you.

56:06.897 --> 56:09.499
Thank you so much, thanks.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.403
* upbeat jazz music.

56:24.482 --> 56:26.349
- Ladies and
gentlemen one more time

56:26.350 --> 56:29.920
for Kira Soltanovich,
let her hear it.

56:32.923 --> 56:35.258
- Why is it so hard?
- You put a lot of effort into it,

56:35.259 --> 56:38.695
- I got a couple other suggestions.
- Funbilical cord.

56:38.696 --> 56:41.064
Funbilical cord.

56:41.065 --> 56:43.066
- Embryhohoho.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.768
That also works for
the Christmas market.

56:44.769 --> 56:46.603
- Embryhohoho.

56:46.604 --> 56:49.172
- I still think fun in
the oven I'm still going for...

56:49.173 --> 56:51.608
- I like fun in the oven.

56:51.609 --> 56:53.042
- Fun in the oven is
good if you have puppets.

56:53.043 --> 56:54.711
Do you have puppets on the show?

56:54.712 --> 56:56.145
Fun in the oven is good
if there's puppets.

56:56.146 --> 56:58.548
Two's a crowdwork.

56:58.549 --> 57:01.350
'Cause you talk to
the audience a lot.

57:01.351 --> 57:03.820
'Cause you banter,
she does a lot of...

57:03.821 --> 57:05.622
- Oh my God I'm not kidding you

57:05.623 --> 57:11.027
that hurts me to
laugh that hard.

57:11.028 --> 57:12.229
I gotta do some deep breaths.

57:13.305 --> 57:19.432
