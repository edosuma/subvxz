WEBVTT

01:39.000 --> 01:40.650
Watch me.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.327
Fuck!

03:07.400 --> 03:08.400
What?

03:08.440 --> 03:09.600
We're here to look at a sofa.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.444
You're an hour late.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.923
That's really good advice, Mom.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.002
I'll have the locks
changed right away.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.404
Any more marital advice?

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
Fuck!

03:48.680 --> 03:50.091
I don't feel too good
about this.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.324
Janice, just tell him
I got the package.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.481
And he didn't understand?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.280
That little man has
the brain of a squid.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.569
Tell him the thing
that he wants, I got.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.404
See if he can decode that.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.560
Hmm?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.168
Yes, the designs, Janice.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.169
Yes, I have the fucking designs.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.171
Why don't we just skywrite
this conversation, huh?

04:25.840 --> 04:29.003
Yeah, and get me a flight out
of here as soon as possible.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.205
Why the hell would I want to stay?
Have you been to Italy?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.130
Baron Hotel, please.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.531
Hotel Barone?

04:36.040 --> 04:38.566
Hotel Barone. Stunning
how you translated that.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.928
Sorry, miss.
Parisian drivers.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.121
The worst.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.721
She's here.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.040
Do you want me to reschedule?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.320
I am so sorry
I'm late.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.402
The one day they cancel
the express train.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.640
I have to be in court, Julia.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.761
I thought we talked about this.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.645
No, I know, I know, I know, but
this really wasn't my fault.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.480
I spoke to the judge, he agreed to
a second psychiatric assessment.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.842
That shrink hated me
before I even walked in.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.760
Well, let's make a better
impression this time,

05:29.800 --> 05:31.484
because his statement
was really damaging.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.001
But did anyone even look
at the report?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.884
Come on,
it was an accident.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.009
How many kids have died
because of dry-cleaning bags?

05:39.080 --> 05:40.764
I saved his life.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.009
Julia, you failed
the lie detector test.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.003
I'm the one that
insisted on doing it!

05:45.080 --> 05:46.605
And I told you
it was a bad idea.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.681
Come on, you have
to understand...

05:47.760 --> 05:49.762
No, no, no, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.968
Right now, we just need
to convince the judge

05:52.080 --> 05:54.321
that you're stable enough
to get visitation again.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.606
Really?
What's the hurry?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.011
It's only been 12 months.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.924
You haven't really
been helping yourself.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.001
Did you get a job?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.923
I've had half a dozen jobs.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.684
One that you keep
for more than a week.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.290
We need a positive report.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.761
Gina will give you the address.
4:00 tomorrow.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.884
You know, that's great.
Let me...

06:09.960 --> 06:12.725
Let me ask to leave early the
first week of a brand-new job.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.444
Just use that
pretty smile of yours.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.684
It's gonna be okay. Okay.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.527
I'm leaving. Relax.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.805
Okay?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.806
Come here.
Give me your hand.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.689
Yeah?

06:42.760 --> 06:44.046
Yuck!

06:44.120 --> 06:46.930
What? Don't say that.
This is Daddy's work.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.240
Yuck!

06:49.000 --> 06:50.570
This is how we do it.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.091
Daddy paints with his hands.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.764
I don't like it.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.126
Just give it a try.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.725
I want it off!

06:57.560 --> 06:59.642
You'll take it off
on the canvas, okay?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.370
Don't want to.
Just try.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.450
Wipe it off!

07:04.560 --> 07:05.971
Here, just wipe it
on the canvas,

07:06.040 --> 07:08.611
and then it'll be
a painting. Okay?

07:08.680 --> 07:10.808
Now, go ahead.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.645
Jesse!

07:19.200 --> 07:20.884
Here, wipe it off.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.491
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand. Oh!

07:28.040 --> 07:29.326
Yuck.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.010
No English, no.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.010
No English.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.205
Bar Americano,
you don't speak English?

08:26.480 --> 08:28.005
Uh...

08:28.080 --> 08:30.162
So, you got a hamburger?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.805
No hamburger, no.

08:31.880 --> 08:32.961
No hamburger.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.202
You understand the term "irony"?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.169
Mmm?
Nothing.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.520
Uh...

08:38.760 --> 08:41.331
Is it too much to
expect a Budweiser?

08:45.040 --> 08:46.041
<i>Beero?</i>

08:46.600 --> 08:47.647

08:48.960 --> 08:50.371

08:50.440 --> 08:51.885
Thank you.

Thank you.

fly me here on points?

Do I want to read
your short story?

11:45.440 --> 11:47.044

11:54.320 --> 11:55.810
You're not gonna
offer me a glass?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.848
And watch it turn to vinegar?
I don't think so.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.524
Drop it anywhere.
I'll get back to you.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.288
You want me to leave after I
just flew all the way here?

12:03.360 --> 12:06.170
On points. If I cared,
I would have paid cash.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.561
You don't even want to have sex?

12:08.640 --> 12:11.007
No. But I appreciate
the offer.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.091
You know that just made me wet.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.651
Sadly, yes.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.891
Okay-

12:19.000 --> 12:20.570
Quite the suite.
Isn't it?

12:20.640 --> 12:21.971
Have you had many women here?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.769
The requisite amount.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.126
A writer needs his muses.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.440
He can never get enough of them.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.244
Mmm, that I know.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.765
When can I expect those notes?

12:29.840 --> 12:32.241
Um, I'll get back to you.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.131
Great.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.843
Nice seeing you, too.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.326
Come here.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.168
This isn't really
mentorly behavior!

13:28.400 --> 13:30.050
Ow!

14:59.400 --> 15:00.925
Excuse me?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.161
You want something?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.803
Yeah, I do, actually.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.450
One of those.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.526
You mind telling me
what that is?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.006

15:36.600 --> 15:38.329
Oh, that's good.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.928
I'm sorry for staring.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.884
Staring.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.805
Looking at you.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.441
With my eyes.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.125
You think I'm too stupid to speak English?

16:00.840 --> 16:03.127
Just apologizing for looking.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.245
It's okay.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.441
You're just looking
at my limoncello.

Oh, yeah, laugh.
It's hysterical.

I'm in a basement.

Excuse me.
A basement!

You... Can't what?

16:40.640 --> 16:42.688
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.843
Are you seriously canceling on me again?
Hi, honey.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.850
You can't be on the phone at work.
I know. Just...

16:47.920 --> 16:49.410
Just one minute.
What about Sunday?

16:52.800 --> 16:55.280
You know what? Just forget about it.
I got to go.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.244
I'm really sorry.
I have no friends left.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.720
They either think
I'm a Child killer

17:02.760 --> 17:04.683
or are sick of hearing me
talk about it.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.090
You sure you want to do this?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.204
Are you kidding me?

17:09.280 --> 17:10.805
I can't even pay my bills.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.040
He makes me quit my job, and
now that nobody will hire me,

17:14.119 --> 17:16.122
he fully cuts off my support.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.804
I know lots of people in retail.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.848
Any of them would
give you a job.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.723
Let me put you at the front desk.
No, no.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.371
You're very sweet. I just
want to be invisible.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.528
And nobody looks at maids.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.404
I know I never did.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.403
Okay.
Thank you.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.527
Get changed.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.924
I'll have someone
show you the ropes.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.241
Gerry, you are
a lifesaver, seriously.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.924
Least I could do.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.968
Uh, uniform.
Okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.002

22:16.320 --> 22:17.890
I'm not the one

22:18.800 --> 22:20.165

22:20.240 --> 22:22.083
in order to understand oneself.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.570
Why? You thinking
of keeping one?

22:24.680 --> 22:26.330
No. I just don't
understand why

22:26.400 --> 22:27.606
you call yourself "He."

22:27.680 --> 22:29.762
"He" thought this.
"She" said that.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.683
Hey. You shouldn't
be reading that.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.923
You don't want me to know
how much you missed me?

22:43.160 --> 22:45.527
How's the book coming along?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.762
Not a subject for conversation.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.205
You want to read mine?

22:49.280 --> 22:51.248
Not just at this moment.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.563
It's short, all you have to
do is say it's brilliant.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.408
Already erased your
texts from other women?

22:58.520 --> 23:00.887
Takes up most of my day.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.970
So, what do you
want to talk about?

23:04.320 --> 23:06.971
Your inability
to see the obvious.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.571
Your assistant has good taste.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.449
I fired her months ago.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.081
She suggested blue,
she had to go.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.845
It's nice.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.851
I can exchange it.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.923
No, I'll find someone
to give it to.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.731
She may have something
for him, too.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.249
She's just waiting
to see if he deserves it.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.288
Oh, he doesn't.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.370
He might.

24:24.640 --> 24:27.211
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.770
Excuse me, excuse me,
<i>scusa</i> me, <i>scusi.</i>

24:28.840 --> 24:30.842
Hey, she left this.
Che?

24:30.920 --> 24:33.605
She left this. The
woman, she left her bag.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.405
The woman.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.365
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.640
A what?

24:47.680 --> 24:49.205
It's not a... bomba.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.090
It's not a bomba,
it's a...

24:55.200 --> 24:57.200
Will you tell him... Tell
him that it's not a bomb.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.169
It's not a bomb.
No, no, no.

25:03.800 --> 25:04.847
Whoa. Hey.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.524
<i>Bar Americana.</i>

25:10.120 --> 25:11.929
Jesus Christ.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.049
Hey, mister! Mister,
you must leave it.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.451
You must leave it.
It's a bomb.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.610
It's not a bomb.
You listen.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.887
Listen to me, listen to me.
It's a bomba.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.685
<i>It's not</i> a <i>bomba.
It's not</i> a <i>bomba.</i>

25:38.800 --> 25:40.484
It's a bag with a monkey.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.683
Who puts a monkey on a bomb?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.689
No, no, no, it's a bomb,
it's a bomb, it's a bomb.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.364
It's not a bomb.
It's not a bomb.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.891
It's children's clothing.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.566
Children's clothing, see?
See for yourself.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.083
What'd he say? He say it
could be a shoe bomb.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.282
A shoe bomb?
It's not a shoe bomb.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
Does this look like a shoe bomb?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.480
Why do you guys always make
it a soap opera? Look.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.641
Take this, okay?

26:05.720 --> 26:07.609
If she comes back, you
give her the bag, okay?

26:07.680 --> 26:09.170
It's not a bomba.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.411
So, when do you
think you'll read it?

26:21.120 --> 26:23.487
Oh, God!
You are relentless.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.681
I know it's good.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.764
I just need to know if older
readers will understand it.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.768
Why don't you want
to tell me about yours?

26:33.840 --> 26:35.171
Because I think it might stink.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.244
God, you like to suffer.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.044
Jake's reading
the first few chapters,

26:39.120 --> 26:41.361
so I guess he'll
tell me soon enough.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.125
You have a Pulitzer,
it doesn't stink.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.091
You haven't read it.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.208
Do you want me to?
No way.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.442
Then shut up.
You're brilliant.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.284
It's the only reason
I'm with you.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.361
Oh!

26:53.440 --> 26:55.204
So, you are with me?

26:59.360 --> 27:02.045
You don't even want to
tell me what it's about?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.888
It's...

27:05.720 --> 27:06.920
It's supposed to be about a man

27:06.960 --> 27:10.043
who can only feel through
the characters he creates.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.851
You should be able to write
the hell out of that.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.810
But it keeps trying
to be something else.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.927
What?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.650
I don't know.
I don't know.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.729
Hence the problem.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.690
You should be writing about me.
Are you?

27:25.480 --> 27:26.811
I write about what I know.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.245
And you know me.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.005
And I fictionalize what
I can't comprehend.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.082
That's a lot of fiction.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.563
So, it's not about me?

27:38.040 --> 27:39.530
You know, if I don't find
a use for you soon,

27:39.600 --> 27:40.880
I'm gonna have
to get rid of you.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.968
You've been saying that
for the last two years.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.040
Isn't gonna happen.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.684
Really? Watch me.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.771
Stop.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.246
What?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.769
You're smiling again.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.569
I wouldn't do that.
Someone might see.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.884
Hey! Come on.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.681
Fold, lift
and tuck, okay?

28:43.960 --> 28:45.962
Got it.
Just do the list.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.531
Soap, shampoo, notepaper.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.367
All on the list.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.049
So, you're an actress?

28:55.120 --> 28:56.565
You study for movie?

28:56.640 --> 28:58.449
Actress? No.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.329
Well, I used to be.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.766
Um...

29:02.520 --> 29:04.170
I was in a soap opera.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.321
Oh, no shit.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.401
Yeah, yeah.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.408
I got the job 'cause
I could cry on cue.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.481
On.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.404
So, you are movie star.
No.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.971
Yeah. Why you stop?

29:14.040 --> 29:15.690
Uh, to have a baby.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.167
Oh, a man got you pregnant.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.207
Yeah.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.441
They always do.

29:22.760 --> 29:23.761
Yeah.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.931
Housekeeping.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.289
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
What's going on?

29:36.360 --> 29:38.203
I had 5,000 euros in this bag.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.450
I tell you,
it was in here!

29:45.200 --> 29:46.281
What did you say?
What did he say?

29:46.360 --> 29:47.441
What? You had my bag?

29:47.520 --> 29:48.646
Oh, for two seconds.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.040
I found it,
I was looking for you.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.646
Out. And you,
too, out!

29:52.720 --> 29:53.760
Oh, now you speak English.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.290
Don't make me call police, okay?

29:55.360 --> 29:56.646
Give me my money,
I go, no problem.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.760
Fucking zingara. You call
me thief in my restaurant?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.609
No, you call this restaurant?

30:00.720 --> 30:02.882
Cockroaches refuse to eat here!
Everybody calm down.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.689
Give me my money!
Take it easy.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.841
Don't you touch me!

30:05.920 --> 30:07.331
<i>Don't touch me, stronzo!</i>

30:11.880 --> 30:13.450
You know the meaning
of the word "asshole"?

30:13.520 --> 30:14.726
Asshole!

30:15.520 --> 30:16.726
Are you all right?

30:20.400 --> 30:21.845
The guy's a jerk.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.042
Miss, miss, the train
station's the other way.

30:32.440 --> 30:33.560
You need money for a ticket?

30:33.600 --> 30:35.921
You want to help,
go get my money, huh?

30:36.320 --> 30:38.243
Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have left the bag.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.606
Or steal my money!

30:41.120 --> 30:42.963
Lady, if I stole your money,
why would I come back?

30:43.080 --> 30:44.969
You know, it's my
daughter's money.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.361
Ask her to forgive you, not me!

30:48.280 --> 30:50.203
All right, let's go back right
now and call the police, okay?

30:50.280 --> 30:51.486
Call the police and they're
going to believe me?

30:51.560 --> 30:52.721
Leave me alone!

30:53.120 --> 30:54.690
Miss. Miss.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.088
Are you trying to kill me off?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.049
I'm gonna take a nap.
I'll see you later.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.486
Wrong floor.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.166
Anna.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.686
You took your own room?

31:07.800 --> 31:09.484
Now you're gonna start on that.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.722
Is nothing good enough for you?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.529
I thought you came here
to spend the week with me.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.449
Did I say in the same room?

31:15.560 --> 31:17.608
Enough people are
talking about us already.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.045
If you don't want
to be seen with me,

31:19.120 --> 31:21.202
why did we just go to the
best restaurant in town?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.203
Oh, please, that is not
the best restaurant.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.361
God!

31:24.440 --> 31:25.885
Listen, I have a reputation.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.325
I know you don't
care about that,

31:27.400 --> 31:29.846
but it means something to me.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.641
Anna.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.401
I'm sorry.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.723
You say that word
so often it has no meaning.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.851
Fuck.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.322
Sure you don't want one?

32:04.680 --> 32:05.681
Hmm?

32:05.760 --> 32:07.649
It's really very good.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.281
Hmm?

32:19.280 --> 32:21.601
The money was for your daughter?

32:26.200 --> 32:28.202
What did she need it for?

32:30.680 --> 32:32.648
Somebody put her on the boat.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.524
It was 5,000 euros.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.246
To get her off the boat
is 5,000 more.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.963
Why a boat?
I'm not...

32:40.040 --> 32:42.930
I mean, can't you just
drive from Romania?

32:44.360 --> 32:47.170
Romania? You see,
you know everything.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.322
Well, what happens now?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.529
Where's her father?

32:57.840 --> 33:00.081
You know, you are not an
easy woman to get to know.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.286
No, you...

33:01.360 --> 33:02.805
You are my new best friend.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.002
What if I can get you the money?

33:09.160 --> 33:11.208
I'm not worth 5,000 euros.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.320
Did I say I wanted to fuck you?

33:13.400 --> 33:15.323
You have nice suit for priest.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.326
And you don't look
like a whore to me.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.845
<i>I'm sorry, signore.</i>

33:36.920 --> 33:39.400
We have no more rooms.
Very busy.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.325
Hey, hey, hey, hey-

33:49.400 --> 33:51.243
They have rooms,
but not for me, okay?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.800
It's okay. You know,
you can have my bed.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.530
I'll sleep in a chair.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.290
For how long?

33:57.840 --> 33:59.968
What do you mean?
All night.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.088
No, I go sleep in station.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.090
What...

35:13.840 --> 35:16.002
You must need sex very badly.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.000
Watch me.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.925
Watch you what, buddy?

36:59.800 --> 37:01.040
Hi.
Hey.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.884
I'm afraid I took
your robe earlier.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.610
You did.
I'm afraid.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.042
So, you've come to return it?

37:07.520 --> 37:08.567
Well, yeah.
I felt bad.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.244
I mean, I thought you might
need it in the morning.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.368
Well, there's two.
There are?

37:12.520 --> 37:13.567
Oh, yeah.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.361
Oh.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.330
Now I feel foolish.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.606
But it might be damp.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.163
I showered earlier.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.285
So, you do need this one?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.450
Couldn't hurt.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.486
Pick it up.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.284
Hand it to me.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.411
Wow.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.964
Thank you.
Wait...

38:13.200 --> 38:14.565
Open the door!

38:15.720 --> 38:18.200
Sorry. Tired.
Comes with age.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.526
You...

38:22.320 --> 38:23.765
You have my key.

38:24.640 --> 38:25.721
Key? Oh.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.730
It's in the pocket.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.127
You are such an asshole.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.961
<i>It's me.
You're probably asleep.</i>

39:45.200 --> 39:46.247
I'll try the...

39:46.360 --> 39:47.964
<i>Message deleted.</i>

41:23.880 --> 41:24.881
Hello?

41:25.040 --> 41:26.040
Gina's apartment flooded,

41:26.080 --> 41:27.923
and I have to be at a
deposition in 20 minutes.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.528
So, what's wrong?
Other than that?

41:30.600 --> 41:33.080
Dr. Gertner had to change
the meeting to her office.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.161
I'm gonna text you the address.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.242
No, no, no, no, I'm
almost out of minutes.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.644
I don't know what that means.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.001
It means I'm on a prepaid phone

41:40.080 --> 41:41.081
and I'm almost out of minutes.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.840
Besides, I'm not even
supposed to be on it.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.047
Seriously?

41:44.400 --> 41:45.526
Okay, write this down.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.210
Wait. Uh, okay.

41:48.920 --> 41:49.920
Okay-

41:49.960 --> 41:51.928
<i>221 East 70th Street.</i>

41:52.320 --> 41:53.560
Got it?

41:53.920 --> 41:55.251
Oh, I got to go.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.042
Oh, shit!
I'm so sorry.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.767
Oh, God!

42:04.720 --> 42:06.688
You know what, I'll just... I'll
come back when you're done.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.125
I'm so sorry.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.761
Want some?

42:24.840 --> 42:25.887
That bad, was it?

42:28.360 --> 42:31.284
You really want to hear what
I have to say? Mmm-hmm.

42:31.760 --> 42:34.081
Okay. It's well-crafted.
Your structure's clever.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.731
Ooh, clever.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.649
You don't want to hear this?
No, I...

42:40.400 --> 42:41.686
Please.

42:44.440 --> 42:47.887
I guess I wish you'd written
about something more personal.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.641
I mean, this is beautiful.
It is, but cold.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.442
Surprisingly what you
always say about me.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.206
I knew this was a mistake.

42:56.280 --> 42:59.443
No, I can take criticism. I hear
it from my editor every day.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.488
You're a party reporter,
for Christ's sake.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.721
I comment on society.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.450
Well, then I am wrong,
because this is absolutely

43:06.600 --> 43:09.440
up to the literary standards of Women's
Wear <i>Daily.</i>

43:11.040 --> 43:13.247
It's Elaine,
I have to take it.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.521
Hi.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.884
I lost my phone.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.691
That's a drag.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.731
Yeah, it's the worst thing
that's happened all month.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.727
<i>I had all of
Robbie's pictures on it.</i>

43:25.960 --> 43:27.803
And I know you told me to
put them on my computer,

43:27.880 --> 43:29.166
but I just didn't do it.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.761
I'm sorry.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.528
I went to the store. They
gave me a new number.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.284
You could have kept
your old number.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.286
Do you want the number?

43:39.520 --> 43:41.284
Yeah, give me a sec.
I'll put it in my phone.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.529
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.201
Got it.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.364
I miss you, Michael.

44:10.480 --> 44:11.845
I'm sorry.

44:12.480 --> 44:15.245
It's not your fault.
You're a romantic.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.081
You love love.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.246
<i>It's people you
don't have time for.</i>

44:20.320 --> 44:21.367
Listen...

44:30.280 --> 44:32.169
<i>So, how's the writing?</i>

44:32.480 --> 44:33.925
So good you wouldn't believe.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.931
Sorry.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.290
Is she there?

44:47.520 --> 44:48.885
No.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.721
<i>Would you tell me if she were?</i>

44:53.360 --> 44:54.771
She's not.

44:56.680 --> 44:59.047
Okay. I'll talk
to you later.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.529
Okay-

45:15.560 --> 45:17.767
She having one of those days?

45:18.600 --> 45:21.365
Don't talk about what
you don't understand.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.249
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm being insensitive.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.322
I'm the one who just took
a call from my spouse

45:25.400 --> 45:27.004
while I was with my lover.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.005
That was stupid,
I'm sorry.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.328
That's the most overused
word in your vocabulary.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.847
Anna, I really need you
to stop attacking me.

45:34.160 --> 45:35.880
If you needed that,
you wouldn't be with me.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.407
I left her.

45:38.400 --> 45:39.731
Two weeks ago.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.321
What did you tell her?

45:42.440 --> 45:44.160
That I had fallen in love
with someone else.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.969
What, me?

45:47.360 --> 45:48.486
You love me?

45:49.680 --> 45:51.880
I thought you loved her. That's
what you've always said.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.607
I do.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.251
So, this is the way you
treat someone you love?

45:56.320 --> 45:57.765
You don't even know
what the word means.

45:57.840 --> 45:58.966
Anna.
Don't touch me.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.001
Do you think I care?

46:01.200 --> 46:03.885
Do you think I could ever love
someone as deceitful as you?

46:04.840 --> 46:06.046
No, fuck you.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.361
This was not the deal.

46:07.680 --> 46:10.160
Now you're gonna go and find
someone and fuck around on me.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.641
Stop this. Did you
tell her who I was?

46:13.280 --> 46:14.361
Did you?

46:14.520 --> 46:15.760
No!

46:17.680 --> 46:20.604
I'm going to my room.
Thanks for the notes.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.607
Ah, 303 just called
for housekeeping.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.444
They had a "Do not disturb" on.

47:27.560 --> 47:29.562
Welcome to show business.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.285
Where'd you get a car?

47:53.440 --> 47:54.521
They just counted it.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.447
Thank you.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.521
You're welcome.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.085
You're not giving it to me?

48:10.160 --> 48:13.050
I'm giving it to you,
but I have to go with you.

48:13.160 --> 48:14.491
That wasn't the deal.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.451
There was no deal.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.530
There was no deal,
I'm giving you my money.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.011
No, you want it back.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.569
No, I want to make sure
that you get there with it.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.085
And you're going to protect me?

48:24.160 --> 48:25.969
Like you did in bar?

48:26.600 --> 48:28.568
These are danger people.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.770
So, you shouldn't
be going alone.

48:35.240 --> 48:37.242
Hey, you can't drive through here.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.320
Watch me.

48:38.400 --> 48:41.051
- Get out of the way! Jesus H.
- Christ!

48:43.200 --> 48:45.328
Watch out. Move, move, move.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.083
<i>You have
reached the law offices...</i>

49:39.160 --> 49:40.400
Excuse me.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.449
Housekeeping!

49:47.720 --> 49:49.006
Hello?

49:53.920 --> 49:55.001
Oh.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.840
$10 phone card.

50:22.160 --> 50:23.491
No $10, $20.

50:33.840 --> 50:34.841
Excuse me.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.044
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

50:42.240 --> 50:44.368
Hey, look,
I lost the address.

50:44.440 --> 50:47.011
70th and what? Just call me back.
I'm on my way.

50:52.840 --> 50:53.966
Thank you for your time.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.929
You're very welcome.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.365
She's late.

51:11.320 --> 51:12.924
Unbelievable.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.883
Well, should we go?

51:19.080 --> 51:20.161
No.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.691
Let's wait.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.921
Jake, I'm so sorry, man. I
don't know where my head was.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.360
No, you know what,
I'm sorry.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.811
I have this thing in 20 minutes.

51:56.240 --> 51:59.289
Fucking book fairs. lend
up eating six times a day.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.522
So, how's Elaine?

52:05.280 --> 52:06.361
Uh...

52:06.760 --> 52:08.205
She's good, good.
Good.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.846
Amazing woman.

52:09.920 --> 52:12.207
How she's coping,
I'll never know.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.211
And Anna?

52:14.960 --> 52:16.689
She would die
that you're asking.

52:16.760 --> 52:19.331
Uh, she thinks
nobody knows about us.

52:19.680 --> 52:23.048
Women have the incredible gift of
being able to deny any reality.

52:26.160 --> 52:27.640
Listen, I was going
to call you anyway

52:27.680 --> 52:29.170
and tell you not
to read those pages.

52:29.240 --> 52:30.366
You know what, I finished
them on the plane.

52:30.440 --> 52:31.885
I couldn't put them down.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.729
We're not gonna publish it.

52:36.600 --> 52:39.649
I'm, uh, reworking it. I
shouldn't have sent it to you.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.125
You know what,
the writing's great.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.601
I love the characters.
That's not it.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.087
The business has changed
so much, Michael.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.003
I wouldn't know
how to market it.

52:50.080 --> 52:52.242
I don't even recognize
our own house anymore.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.240
I'm selling self-help
cookbooks by reality stars.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.320
Somebody else will print it.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.407
It'll make a fortune.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.164
We'll be jealous as hell.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.800
I really am sorry, Michael.
I do have this thing.

53:04.760 --> 53:05.807
Call me when you're back.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.564
Don't lie to me,
you son of a bitch!

53:08.520 --> 53:09.521
I'm a son of a bitch?

53:09.600 --> 53:11.284
I've known you how long?

53:11.360 --> 53:13.408
How long, Jake? Don't
you dare lie to me.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.611
Okay-

53:28.920 --> 53:31.127
Your first book,
stunning.

53:32.600 --> 53:36.047
It was cruel and raw.
No pity, no shame.

53:36.520 --> 53:38.409
God, I used to proofread
your galleys sweating,

53:38.480 --> 53:39.845
it was so fucking brave.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.440
Second book less so.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.970
Third, fourth...

53:48.520 --> 53:52.206
Now you have random characters making
various excuses for your life.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.051
Michael, I was frankly
embarrassed to read it.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.808
And I couldn't tell you that.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.491
Wow.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.768
That's, uh...

54:11.040 --> 54:12.963
Give my love to Elaine.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.930
Hello?
You're a half hour late.

54:34.240 --> 54:36.527
I know. I'm almost there.
Where are you?

54:36.600 --> 54:38.807
I told you,
70th and Lex.

54:39.080 --> 54:41.048
Shit.
Where are you?

54:41.520 --> 54:42.521
The West Side!

54:43.080 --> 54:44.206
Get in a cab.

54:44.280 --> 54:45.680
I don't have any money.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.047
What?

54:47.200 --> 54:48.531
I spent it on my phone card.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.687
Listen to me.
Get in a cab now.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.569
Okay? I'll meet
you downstairs.

54:54.440 --> 54:55.566
On, God! Okay.

55:16.080 --> 55:18.128
Across town,
70th and Lex.

55:24.720 --> 55:27.246
So, where is this place
we're going?

55:29.360 --> 55:31.124
You like that music?

55:31.680 --> 55:33.364
Yeah. Why?

55:39.000 --> 55:40.240
So, this is a friend's car?

55:41.040 --> 55:42.041
You don't have friends?

55:45.200 --> 55:46.964
So, the name of the place?

55:48.120 --> 55:49.560
Or is it just called
"Danger People"?

55:56.680 --> 55:57.681
Here!

56:00.760 --> 56:02.569
- Keep the change.
- I'm so, so sorry.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.205
I'm going to the bathroom,

56:15.280 --> 56:17.248
and then I'm going to leave.

56:21.280 --> 56:23.567
Hey. Hey.

56:27.320 --> 56:29.129
I'm sorry, okay?

56:30.120 --> 56:32.327
Look, it's just, you know, you try
and tell people about someone,

56:32.400 --> 56:34.004
and they don't believe you.

56:34.480 --> 56:35.891
This is her.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.966
She doesn't give
a shit about anyone.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.842
All right, we'll go.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.283
I'll pull the car up.

56:52.840 --> 56:54.080
Wait here.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.606
Forty-five minutes is not
late, it's a no-show.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.205
But she had an emergency.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.488
She's here now. And I
have an appointment.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.728
And I did do my
homework, Miss Lowry.

57:14.800 --> 57:15.926
I didn't need to see your client

57:16.000 --> 57:17.445
to know that she fits
the profile of someone

57:17.520 --> 57:19.841
who'd commit this kind of act.

57:19.920 --> 57:21.684
I can't believe this.

57:22.240 --> 57:25.847
You arrogant bitch, you judge
her before even seeing her!

57:25.960 --> 57:27.689
That was her choice.

57:28.920 --> 57:30.206
Good day.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.121
Will she see me?

57:33.200 --> 57:34.884
No. No, she won't.

57:35.200 --> 57:36.406
And if I weren't
working for you,

57:36.480 --> 57:38.209
I wouldn't be here, either.

57:38.280 --> 57:40.567
How could you be so
fucking irresponsible?

57:40.720 --> 57:42.609
I came as soon as I could.
This is not my...

57:42.680 --> 57:43.966
I know it's not your fault.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.280
I don't know what really
happened with your son, Julia...

57:46.320 --> 57:47.810
What? ...but this
should have been

57:47.880 --> 57:51.930
the most important thing in your
life, and you weren't here.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.445
And after a second
negative report,

57:53.520 --> 57:55.409
you'll be lucky if you
ever see this kid again.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.328
Maybe he deserves better.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.770
Bye, Julia.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.529
Are you okay?

59:20.520 --> 59:22.329
I'm sorry, what?

59:26.880 --> 59:29.008
Is there anything I can do?

59:46.640 --> 59:47.926
Here.

59:49.240 --> 59:50.844
Thank you.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.609
Do you work here?

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.485
No.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.083
Do you think it's okay
if I sit here for a while?

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.205
Sure.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.163
Do you have any kids?

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.165
No.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.484
Are you married?

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.690
No.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.324
I have to go.
Yeah.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.371
Yeah.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.609
Someone is waiting.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.450
You're very kind.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.562
I wish you were my friend.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.964
Where are you going?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.890
With you.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.966
<i>Stupido.</i>

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.481
I want to dance.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.131
Yes, miss.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.241
Any idea of where
I might do that?

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.489
Excuse me.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.451
Hello.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.329
Give him the money.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.046
Please.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.882
What do we have?
English?

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.920
American.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.729
Monika, you have
an American boyfriend.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.086
Congratulations.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.524
I tell you not to come.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.802
American,
you have a sister?

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.320
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.408
I'll be sure to bring
her next time.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.290
There you go.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.204
Boyfriend doesn't like me.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.520
He's not my boyfriend.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.444
Hmm, not your boyfriend, but
he brings me 10,000 euros.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.251
Ten? No, no,
you said five.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.727
Five?
This is Monika.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.771
She tries to pay half price
for her own daughter.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.205
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.850
but I agreed to five, all right?

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.046
I'm not paying 10.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.201
No, you are not.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.920
Ten was the price for her.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.925
You are not her.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.126
For you, it's 25.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.526
What? You gotta be kidding.
Where is she?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.365
You want to fuck with me some more?
See what happens?

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.410
You could not wait in car.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.810
Mmm?

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.088
I am happy I'm not you.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.567
Listen, I'm just trying
to help, okay?

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.331
That's 5,000 euros.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.721
That's how much I have.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.521
Why don't you take it and get
this girl out of your hair?

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.922
That's how much you have?

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.929
Even I have more than that.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.687
You two must think I'm an idiot.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.444
See? You see what you did?
Whoa. What I did?

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.640
You don't think I know
when I'm being conned?

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.803
Fuck you!
Fuck you, American!

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.120
Give me my money.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.922
Your money?
Give it to me!

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.091
This is his phone number.
Did you write that?

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.401
Do you know
his number? No.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.644
You stole my money.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.131
Souvenir of Rome.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.167
Oh, fuck. My bags.
Oh, shit.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.210
Hey! My bags!

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.681
You have bags?

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.886
No bags.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.521
Hi. Did, uh, Miss Barr...
Yes, sir.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.730
She asked you to give me this?

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.201
If you asked.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.881
If I asked?

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.246
Yes, sir.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.688
And, uh, where is this place?

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.086
Want to dance?

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.127
Dance?

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.481
He has moves.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.041
Move, singular.
He has move.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.326
Nice dress, baby.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.601
Oh.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.444
I have great taste.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.165
Good evening.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.088
Very good. Terrible.
Terrible.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.082
Very good.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.888
<i>I love you.
And that's it. Bye.</i>

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.162
<i>Recorded 119 days ago.</i>

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:08.288
<i>To save, press one.</i>

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.726
Pronto.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.888
I can get you the money.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.401
Mmm.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.726
<i>Signore?</i>

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.684
Yes?
Breakfast in bed?

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.603
<i>I can't. Sorry.
I have to run.</i>

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.127
Where?

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.690
I'm meeting a friend.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.565
So, we'll have lunch, then?

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.290
<i>I'm not sure
when I'll be back.</i>

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.320
Then I'll make reservations
for dinner.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.609
I just said I don't know
when I'll be back.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.800
How long are you gone for?

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.127
I don't know.
I'll text you.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.804
Where the hell are you
going, the Arctic?

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.129
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.570
You want to tell me
what this is about?

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.210
Don't be pathetic.
Who are you meeting?

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.884
A friend.
What, a male friend?

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.849
I have a life,
my own life.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.806
Anna, everything was great.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.166
Well, then there
isn't a problem.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.489
It's only three floors. Use
the stairs, you lazy bastard.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.888
Look, don't do this to yourself.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.041
Oh, how sweet.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.804
He's trying to
save her from herself.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.246
I'm not your fucking child.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.004
Then don't act like one.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.170
Oh. That's good.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.762
When something cuts too deep, he
reaches for a comforting cliche.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.085
Anna.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.685
Please.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.571
Begging?

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.683
Do you know why she chooses
married men, Michael?

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.850
'Cause she doesn't have to care.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.365
They can't hurt her.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.206
And she can leave
whenever she wants.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.570
Oh...

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.531
Look at that face.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.169
He needs love so badly
until he has it.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.129
Find someone
who doesn't know you.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.281
Ciao.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.610
Hey, I'm here.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.289
Want to come down and we
get something to eat?

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.002
I'm really hungry,
though.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.966
Okay. Yeah.
Just for a minute.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.281
Okay-

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.524
Oh, Richie Rich.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.285
Good to see you.
I love that comic book.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.283
And there is
my beautiful Monika.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.004
Are you two fighting?

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.286
Oh.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.283
Come, kiss.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.731
Kiss.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.690
Monika's a very
good kisser, huh?

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.844
Come on, Richie.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.925
Look, feel this. Richie,
come here, feel this.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.809
You have to feel. You have to feel.
Enough.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.609
Hey. Come on. I'm serious.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.566
Want to count it?

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.648
You don't know
what you're missing.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.011
Where's the girl?

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.371
The girl.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.041
That's the question.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.048
You meet a woman in a bar.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.405
She takes you to a man
who demands money.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.931
You give it.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.207
Why?

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.004
You don't know the woman,
you don't know the man.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.205
She could be lying.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.684
Maybe they both are.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.446
This girl you're paying
for may not even exist.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.001
You have to be thinking,
"ls there really a girl?"

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.081
So...

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.607
Why, Richie Rich,
why give me the money?

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.246
Where's the girl?

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.490
You want me to
answer your question,

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.528
but you won't answer mine.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.246
Okay-

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.403
If you can get 25 you can get 50.
No, no, that's it.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.323
No, no, there's not gonna
be a penny more.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.084
We'll see. I can wait.
Where is she?

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.960
With my friend,
and he's enjoying her company.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.203
Hey... hey...

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.281
Oh!

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.081
Whoa.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.810
Put the gun down.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.891
Put it down.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.405
You hit me,
Richie Rich.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.807
Huh?

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.086
All right.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.087
You make me look bad
in front of this woman.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.362
Fine. Fine.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.090
Now it's 100.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.922
100, or she's working
the street tomorrow.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.602
She has lips like her mother.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.406
Carlo, it's me.
Please.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.123
She's eight years old.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.645
What, another friend?

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.051
There's my girl.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.290
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.525
For my wife.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.441
What are you looking for?

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.085
No, no, no.
Hey, no, no, no.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.400
Give me the gun.
No.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.811
You want him to kill me?

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.200
What, so the plan's
to shoot him?

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.768
Hey. Why you take my money?

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.769
Why? I don't know, I don't know.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.570
Ah! I don't know!
I don't know!

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.563
It was stupid.
It was stupid.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.051
Maybe I wanted to see you again,

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.531
or save the day or something.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.806
I don't know.

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.447
It was stupid. Do we always
know why we do things?

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.530
Or you just wanted my money!
Stop it!

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.651
You tell me why you left it there, huh?
You tell me.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.561
'Cause nobody forgets something
that important.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:51.162
Come on, you tell me, huh? You
wanted me to take it, didn't you?

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.170
Hmm? Where were you,
across the street?

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.241
Watching?

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.448
You wanted me to
feel guilty, is that it?

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.005
So you could use me?

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.602
Because that's what
you do, you use men.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.446
Don't you?
Don't you?

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.761
I knew 5,000
wasn't enough, okay?

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.285
That I would go to bring her,

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.124
he would want more.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.009
Five was all I could save.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.130
Carlo hates me.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.725
Maybe he has reasons.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.808
But he was the only one
who could bring her to me.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.049
I thought he'd ask 10.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.691
Then you saw the suit.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.410
Richie Rich. I don't
know what that means.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.284
It means you thought
I had money.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.441
Oh, and you don't?

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.601
No, I don't.
Not like that.

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.604
Look at the label.
It's a fake.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.847
I rip off Italian designs, and
I sell them to sweatshops.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.643
Picked the wrong guy.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.568
No. I didn't.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.847
I just didn't think Carlo

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.041
would be so greedy.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.406
And I didn't think
you'd hit him.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.764
Neither did I.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.444
That was very stupid.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.768
I've done stupider things.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:35.289
Fuck you.
That's my daughter.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.763
She's alone and scared.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.681
What would you do?

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.081
Give me.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.647
Give me the gun.

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.123
Point this at him,
he will kill you.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.886
Declined.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.645
Try again.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.961
Declined.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.642
Try again. It's not
going to work.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.720
Hey, you can't
walk out with that.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:24.801
Watch me.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:25.881
Hey!

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:35.965
<i>Signore. Uh, Signore.</i>

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.565
Signore has a single room.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.001
Yeah, we're together.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.721
Ah, can I ask
how long you will be?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.331
How long?

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.851
We're going to be leaving
tomorrow morning. Together.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.561
And if you have even
the slightest objection,

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.722
I'll show you exactly how
an American man reacts

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.200
when you're disrespectful to his wife.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.205
Honey, please.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.846
Have a good night.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.481
<i>Spasibo.</i>

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.805
You can sleep on bed.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.406
No, I'm good here.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.883
I won't attack you.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.563
How can I be so sure?

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.843
Okay-

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.684
So, you're a thief?

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.369
I'm a businessman.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.763
But you steal clothes.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.162
Designs. And I don't steal,
I pay people who have...

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.365
...advance knowledge.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.805
Oh, so you're a spy.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.601
Yeah.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.360
A clothing spy-

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.406
Yeah.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.445
That's too sad.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.406
I prefer to think
of you as thiefs.

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.807
No one ever
called me that before.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.451
A "thiefs"?

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.645
A Wife.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.168
So, you were gonna
punch him, too?

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.565
Go to sleep.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.285
Okay-

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.130
Larry, Larry...

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.208
Larry, Larry, Larry, stop.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.290
Just tell me how much I have.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:14.764
It's not your money, Larry.
How much?

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.685
That's it?

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.531
Okay-

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.731
Send it.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.160
Larry, thank you for caring.

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.445
Send it.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.931
Okay-

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.885
Do you have a bag?

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.205
How can you be so weak?

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.088
How? How can you love me?

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.322
How?
Please, baby, baby...

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.811
How?
Baby...

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.887
No, no.
Anna, Anna. Baby.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.530
Okay.

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.045
It's okay.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.285
It's okay.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.165
Why does it feel damp?

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.207
I can take it back.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.328
No, no, no, no. I love it.

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.450
I can't believe you got
me all those flowers.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:31.965
Got them on points.

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.124
A lot of points.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.564
Why do you love me?

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.164
I'm so awful to you.

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.170
It's your smile.

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.482
I know what that smile costs.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.162
I don't know what that means.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.006
You know who I was
with, don't you?

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.802
It doesn't matter to me.

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.370
But you know.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.610
I don't care.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.369
I'm gonna ruin it.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.490
I always do, every time
you're good to me.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.647
Aw!

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.085
Black, no sugar.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.851
Thank you.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.725
Oh, I have to take this.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.884
No problem.
Sorry.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.091
Hi.

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.765
Where <i>did</i> you go?

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.484
I'm sorry. I had to get
back to my friend.

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.451
Come back.

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.050
I'm with someone.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.082
He's really good to me.

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.606
He's gonna hurt you.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.963
No, you don't know him.

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.289
I don't have to.
Come back to me.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.688
Can you do something for me?

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.007
Anything.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.131
It's really important.

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.486
<i>Anything-.</i>

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.489
Will you forgive me?

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.086
<i>Oh, baby, none of
this is your fault.</i>

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.366
Yes, it is.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.727
<i>You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.924
You know what I did.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.764
It's just love.

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.611
Come back.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.360
I'm trying to protect you.
You know that, right?

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.481
<i>You've been hurt so much. I
can't stand to see you hurt.</i>

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.325
I know.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.410
Good-bye, Daddy.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.846
Let's go.

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:21.969
You seem to have an
unending supply of friends.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.040
They're waiting.
Let's go.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.445
They can wait.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.721
Sit.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.004
That's his bike.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.530
Your pal, Carlo.

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.248
So?
He was in Rome.

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.124
When?
At the bar.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.165
And outside my hotel.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.206
On that bike.

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.849
You weren't watching your money.

01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:58.526
He was.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.205
You are making
no sense. Let's go.

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.805
Really? What is he,
your husband?

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.084
Mmm? The boyfriend?
Your pimp?

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.206
What is he?

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.961
That's why they're here?
To arrest me?

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.923
Policeman, this man
needs you to arrest me.

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.170
Do they look like
they understand English?

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.441
Play your own games.

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.760
Miss. Miss.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.444
You left your bag.

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.608
You don't want it?
I'm giving it to you.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.521
You think I'm stupid person?

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.727
Huh? I take this bag,
they put me in jail.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.803
No. It's yours.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.730
Take it and go.

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.208
Or you can take it
and come with me.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.809
With you?
Yes.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.167
Where?

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:08.926
Anywhere.

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.891
You take me? Knowing
what you think you know?

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.645
You have a bag of money.
I'd be a fool not to.

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:21.130
What about my daughter?

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.480
Should just leave her?

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.606
You think it's
all game, bullshit.

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.170
You don't think she exist.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.363
I'm gonna believe she does.

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.164
Take it.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.609
Am I Jenna?

01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.886
<i>Am I?</i>

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.208
He's saying she was
the love of his life.

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.400
No, no, no, no, no.
Let me read it.

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.527
But when it's done, okay?

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.681
When it's done.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.684
But you wrote "the" love.

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.321
Yeah.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.447
Of his life.

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.965
His entire life.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.125
I'm gonna erase it. No,
no, I'll leave you alone.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.326
I'll leave you alone.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.210
Now, please?
Yeah.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.406
Ow!
Okay, okay, I'm going.

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.329
Oh. Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:38.841
Shh.

<i>You have no saved messages.</i>

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.807
Hello.

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.089
Um, if anyone calls,
I'm moving up to suite 415.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.321
Leary.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.047
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
some flowers brought up.

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.209
Thank you.

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.321
Bonjour.

Housekeeping.

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.800
I'm sorry, sir.

<i>Messages are automatically

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.967
Yeah, yeah, but you have
to have it somewhere, right?

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.611
I mean, it's not
just gone, right?

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.565
No, you have it somewhere.

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.130
It's saved somewhere.

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.929
I'm sorry...
No, you have backups.

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.605
<i>I'm sorry, is there anything else...
No! You...</i>

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.251
No! No, you're not
fucking sorry!

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.127
No!

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.280
Hello?

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.250
Can I come up, please?

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:07.891
Jesse's not here.

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.561
Please.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.240
You can leave it here. I'll
tell him you brought it.

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.683
You know that I
would never hurt him.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.090
Right? It's just us here.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.081
Come on, you know.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.684
What do you want, Julia?

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.285
Just tell me that you know.

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.370
You hate me,
I cheated on you, but...

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.851
I don't care!
Yes, you do.

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.441
And it's okay.

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.720
But I just need to be able
to see him sometimes.

01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.364
You see him.
On Skype.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.570
I need to be able to
touch him. He is my son.

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.403
I can't, okay? I can't.

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.250
Not alone.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.165
Julia, you tried to hurt him.

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:11.366
No, I didn't.

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:13.401
Yes, you did.

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.245
You can't admit it,
but you did.

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.085
What makes you so smart?

01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.971
Huh? You weren't
even there.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.724
The police said
that I didn't do it.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:21.881
No.

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.282
They said they didn't have
enough proof to prosecute.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.006
It's not the same thing.

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.926
Child Services would not
have taken Jesse away

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:30.800
if they didn't think that you did it.
Really?

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.208
Mmm-hmm. Really? You
don't think it's because

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.647
you're rich and
famous and can afford

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.484
fancy lawyers and I'm nothing?

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.001
No.

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:41.168
No, that couldn't be it.
No, it could.

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.001
Except that I know you.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:46.690
Come on, I would
never hurt Jesse.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.050
Not when you're yourself.

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.441
Look, I just need to
be able to see him.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.331
Please.

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.726
Please.

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.447
Okay. Then tell me.

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:23.845
Tell me that you did it.

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.689
Why do you get to play God?

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.650
I gave you everything.

01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:35.366
I gave up everything
to have him.

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:39.091
Just tell me,
and you can see him.

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.884
Not alone,
but you can visit.

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:48.205
Just tell me.

01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.489
Okay. <i>I</i> did it.

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.121
No.

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:06.046
You're just saying that
because you want to see him.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.762
I need you to look
at what you did.

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:11.163
I need you to face
what you can't face,

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:12.685
and I need you to
tell me the truth.

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.640
I didn't.

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.804
Julia, if you don't face
it, you can't change.

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.449
And I'll never be
able to trust you.

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:29.845
You need to tell me.

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:33.611
Just tell me.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.840
Say it.

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.764
He was in the closet, playing
with dry-cleaning bags.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.964
He was pretending to be a ghost,

01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:57.724
and I kept telling him not to,

01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.131
but he didn't listen.

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.406
He never listens.

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.527
You know that.

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.324
But you weren't there.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.764
You were never there,
even when we were together.

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.167
It was always just me and him,

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.287
and me and him,

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.567
and I had to show him
what could happen.

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.084
I had to protect him.

01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:36.364
I'm so sorry.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.525
I'm so sorry.

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.120
Okay-

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.451
Thank you.

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.085
It'll be okay, please.

01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:59.323
Yeah, it'll be okay.
Okay.

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.888
I'm never gonna let
you see him again.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.526
What?

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.441
Get out.

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.363
No.
Get the fuck out!

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.289
No, you said that if I
said that I did it...

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:13.646
Get out!
No, I lied!

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:14.881
Get out!
I just said it because...

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.291
Get the fuck out of here!

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.725
No! No!
Get out!

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:18.801
No, I lied!
Get out!

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:21.611
I lied! No! No! No! No!

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.245
Oh, my God. Jesse.

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:59.010
Jesse, baby!
I told you she did it!

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.684
Jesse, baby, come on!

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:01.761
Come on! Come on!
I told you she...

01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.683
Jesse! Jesse!

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:06.769
Jesse! God damn it!

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:42.721
Hey-

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.120
You Okay?

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:48.926
You all right?

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.767
Never do that to me again, okay?

01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.290
Please?

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.846
Theresa Lowry.

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.566
<i>Hi.</i>

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.484
<i>Thanks for picking up.</i>

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:18.566
I didn't know it was you.

01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.481
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.046
I'm fine, Scott.
How are you?

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:31.041
I don't know what to do, Terry.

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.770
I don't know how
to forgive myself.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.128
Do you know how
long she talked about

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.522
showing you how she could swim

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.367
<i>whenever you got back
from wherever you were?</i>

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.846
Please don't.

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.640
<i>She was always trying
to get your attention.</i>

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.490
All you had to do was watch her,

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.720
and you couldn't even do that.

01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.524
You walked away to
take a phone call.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:53.564
<i>It was 30 seconds.</i>

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:56.486
She wasn't in the pool.

01:55:58.280 --> 01:55:59.725
I was gone for 30 seconds.

01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.724
<i>You know, I never asked you,
but did you make that deal?</i>

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.170
Did you get that
contract, Scott?

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.043
You keep trying to
forgive yourself.

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.371
I never will.

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.480
Okay-

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.201
Jesus.

01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:39.361
It's a lot of work.

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.960
I can have it finished
in three months.

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.770
Does she know you're doing this?

01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.762
People are gonna know it's Anna.

01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.846
Six months from now,
she'll be the punch line

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.604
at every cocktail
party in New York.

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.601
You can do that to her?

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:06.601
It's the weakest story.

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:08.125
It's the strongest choice.

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.244
Well?

01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:27.926
Okay-

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:45.761
Hi.

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:53.005
He didn't want this?

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:55.366
No, it's for you.

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.044
He asked me to pour it.

01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:58.846
He did?

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.645
Why?

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.488
She asked him to
take care of you.

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.571
Who did?

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:07.606
In the elevator.

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.969
She asked him to
take care of you.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:12.681
How do you know?

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.408
He told me when he
asked for the milk.

01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.845
Did he say anything else?

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.009
Did she say
anything else to him?

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.521
No.

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:26.810
She didn't say
that she was sorry?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.240
No.

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.487
What are you doing?

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.728
Eating the whole
pancake? Yeah?

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.646
I'm gonna need another night.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.324
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:42.204
You know where I
can buy a shirt?

02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:36.091
You have new shirt.

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.480
Yes.

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:42.891
It's nice.

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:45.006
Thank you.

02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:49.290
You waited for me.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.445
Yes.

02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:57.288
I give him the money.

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:05.884
Will you still take me?

02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:09.849
I don't have anything left.

02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:14.411
Will you take me,
no questions?

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.122
Just take me.

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:23.444
Yes.

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:26.965
Okay-

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:34.444
Your daughter?

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:37.651
Can I meet her?

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:43.120
You are fool to
have believed me.

02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:59.842
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.280
Hey.

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:04.800
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.644
<i>You can have him
tonight if you like.</i>

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:10.691
<i>Okay-</i>

02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.166
Hi.

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:44.641
How's Rome?

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.481
You know, warm.

02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:52.570
I love that tiny apartment
on the piazza.

02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:57.210
So, did you, um,
finish reading it?

02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:00.285
Last night.

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.606
It's good.

02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:04.966
You're not just saying that?

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:07.201
<i>No.</i>

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:08.920
<i>It's good.</i>

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.571
Thanks.

02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:13.568
Must have been hard
for you to read it.

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.970
How you live for her smile?

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:19.169
How she's the love of your life?

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:20.611
Why would that bother me?

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.408
If I could've trusted
anyone else to read it...

02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:25.130
Stop trying to get
sympathy, Michael.

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.169
<i>I'm sure I'll be reading
this conversation</i>

02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:28.241
<i>in the next draft.</i>

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:33.245
You really don't feel
a thing, do you?

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.565
Is she there?

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:44.730
No.

02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:46.131
You're lying again.

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.326
She left me.

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:50.531
Couple of months ago.

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:59.401
You told her that you were writing
about her and her father?

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.331
No.

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.324
She read my journal.

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.490
Oh, God, Michael.

02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:21.451
I'm cold.

02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:23.249
I just came in from a swim.

02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:26.762
I'm glad you're
using the pool again.

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:30.845
You used his name.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:33.691
Robbie.

02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:35.929
Yeah, I'm gonna change it.

02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.051
<i>Don't.</i>

02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:41.001
It happened in a moment.
It wasn't your fault.

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:46.201
He just so wanted
to make you proud.

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:51.528
It wasn't a business
call, Elaine.

02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:56.646
I lied.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.691
It wasn't business.

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:04.926
Who was it?

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.690
God, Michael.

02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:21.489
Does she know it was
her on the phone?

02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.846
Come home.

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:43.925
Come home, Michael.

02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:49.571
How?

02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.771
Watch me.

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:06.326
I have to go.

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:11.125
Michael.

02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:05.049
Watch me.
