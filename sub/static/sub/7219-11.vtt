00:01.035 --> 00:03.605
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.217
Shit, Danny.

00:08.308 --> 00:09.844
I swear to God,
I didn't see it either.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.947
That's rich coming from a woman

00:13.013 --> 00:15.493
so ashamed of her own son,

00:15.616 --> 00:17.152
she don't even admit she got one.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.695
You need to decide right now.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.633
- You a Crowe or not?
- Yeah.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.999
I was dating this social worker,
Alison Brander.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.741
Kendal went to see her this afternoon...

00:30.964 --> 00:32.738
And now you think
they might be coming after her.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.412
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Well, I can...

00:35.536 --> 00:37.209
No. I'll handle it myself.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.012
We just learned that
Boyd Crowder has lost half our shipment.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.479
You have to ask yourself a question.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.983
Who am I gonna work with?

00:44.211 --> 00:46.817
Him, who most certainly's
gonna get you killed...

00:47.314 --> 00:49.555
Or me, who most certainly
is gonna get you rich.

00:49.650 --> 00:54.565
You got yourself caught between
a Detroit rock and a shitkicker hard place.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.998
I could use some help.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.592
- So what do you need?
- An assessment.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.068
The rock or the shitkicker.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.034
You think you got protection from Judith,

01:01.161 --> 01:02.401
but you don't mean shit to her.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.074
Ava.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.583
Your elbow.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.275
Somebody gonna tell us
what the hell's going on here?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.813
Shit, Penny, I know
you didn't forget the rules.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.522
No talking during lockdown.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.958
Matter of fact, next one
opens her mouth buys a week in the hole.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.643
I want to let you know,

03:25.706 --> 03:27.982
my loyalty was always to you, Boyd.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.652
That little fella give you what you needed?

03:36.183 --> 03:38.322
As it happens, he did not.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.933
Can't help feeling it's a shame,

03:47.994 --> 03:51.532
you shelling out money
and not getting anything in return.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.736
There's got to be something I can do for you.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.029
Mr Duffy.

04:15.288 --> 04:19.293
Well, I believe you're right.
There are a few things we need to discuss.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.870
I assume neither one of us
is too keen on doing this over the phone.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.471
Fair enough.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.044
You want me to bring the coffee?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.743
Well, Ms Teri,

04:34.808 --> 04:38.051
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to bring our evening to a close.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.590
I'm gonna need a clear head in the morning.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.756
I could help you clear it.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.226
Darlin'.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.294
It's not that
I don't appreciate the offer... Truly.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.731
There's really nothing that I can give you.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.399
Well, I wouldn't be
opposed to taking one of those cigarettes.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.242
Never knew you to be a smoker.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.241
Well, it's been a long time since I was.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.680
But I believe the time has come

05:09.810 --> 05:12.017
to start making some changes.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.023
So, the Marshals Service
doesn't believe I'm in danger,

05:15.115 --> 05:16.788
- but you're moving me anyway?
- Yep.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.823
Can you elaborate on that a little?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.357
Well, could you pick it up a little?

05:22.455 --> 05:23.627
Deal.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.435
All right, Raylan and I

05:25.492 --> 05:28.132
just thought it might be
a good idea if you were looked after.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.005
And the service doesn't provide

05:30.096 --> 05:33.873
official protection
unless there's a specific, credible threat.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.111
But you can call this
an abundance of caution.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.172
And you swear Raylan's all right.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.276
He's not lying dead on a slab somewhere
and you're holding back telling me?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.787
Yes, ma'am, I swear.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.791
It's just that things have
heated up between him

05:47.447 --> 05:48.721
and the Crowe family, and we thought

05:48.815 --> 05:50.488
that since they came
at you once to get to him...

05:50.550 --> 05:53.554
You two are worried
Dan's gonna run me off the road again?

05:56.289 --> 05:57.632
Something like that.

05:58.124 --> 06:00.365
You think they'd leave me alone
if I told them we broke up?

06:01.561 --> 06:02.631
We did, by the way.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.300
Did Raylan tell you that?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.338
He might have mentioned
something about that.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.469
Ma'am,

06:07.868 --> 06:10.849
you know, we're only
gonna be gone just a couple of days.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.144
He mentioned what happened to his eye.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.577
Did he, now?

06:16.676 --> 06:18.815
Told me you did it. Didn't tell me why.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.520
Well, is this your way of asking me
to tell you why?

06:24.017 --> 06:25.758
I'm just making conversation.

06:26.152 --> 06:28.496
Course, if you wanted to tell me, you know,

06:28.588 --> 06:30.534
listening is a big part of my job.

06:31.424 --> 06:32.994
I'll bet you're good at it.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.734
Let me ask you this...

06:35.829 --> 06:37.672
If I were 10 admit to hitting him...

06:38.565 --> 06:40.169
Could you call it child abuse

06:40.233 --> 06:42.076
and take custody of him for me?

06:42.869 --> 06:44.109
I like you.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.076
Here. I'll get that.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.346
- Okay.
- Yeah. After you.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.786
Thanks.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.349
Yeah, I don't know. I mean...

06:57.183 --> 06:58.526
Hold on. Hold on.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.031
Let's just... Age before beauty, okay?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.299
Oh. my God!

07:25.946 --> 07:26.947
All right.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.288
I need you to call 911. Jesus.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.793
- Oh, my God.
- You're hit!

07:32.752 --> 07:34.493
No, ifs not me. it's you.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.762
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.063
Oh, my God.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.506
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.780
West Palm. That's on the water, right?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.317
Yes, ma'am.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.787
Beaches nearby, warm sun.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.126
That'll be good for her.
Help with the cabin fever.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.791
Cabin fever, huh?

08:40.285 --> 08:42.892
Oh, my God. First six months.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.829
I guess I didn't think of that.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.567
But makes sense.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.703
Her mothers nearby.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.302
I suppose the three of them will meet up

08:55.368 --> 08:57.712
and take the stroller
through Okeeheelee Park.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.816
But you don't know.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.411
No.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.982
'Cause you're not where you're needed.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.053
Where I'm needed?

09:10.817 --> 09:12.728
Where you can do the most good.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.067
Sorry. I'm...

09:18.158 --> 09:20.195
Are we still speaking about Winona?

09:21.661 --> 09:23.766
Why was he alone, Raylan?

09:25.665 --> 09:27.611
Chief deputy. No backup?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.736
- He was...
- And why weren't you there?

09:29.836 --> 09:31.509
Now wait...

09:31.571 --> 09:33.847
A good man is in the hospital,

09:33.907 --> 09:36.513
and I'm not saying it should be you, Raylan.

09:37.343 --> 09:41.189
I just want to know why you weren't where
you were supposed to be.

09:48.054 --> 09:52.400
<i>Dr Delvaughn to pathology.</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:16.087
Leslie Mullen, Dr Jay Patel.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.421
Is he alive?

10:18.551 --> 10:19.621
Mrs Mullen...

10:19.719 --> 10:21.494
- Is my husband alive?
- Yes.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.763
He's extremely critical.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.130
Please, Mrs Mullen.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.638
My office will give us some privacy.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.780
- Is he gonna make it?
- He lost a lot of blood.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.183
They had to put those
anti-shock compression pants on him.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.083
Keep his pressure from bottoming out.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.148
- He conscious?
- He went out in the ambulance.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.624
Hasn't opened his eyes since.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.929
I don't suppose he thought
to tell the EMTs who did this to him.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.632
What about Alison? She see anything?

10:56.422 --> 10:58.595
- She's pretty shook up.
- She see anything or not?

10:59.592 --> 11:02.368
He had her on the floor
before she knew there was anything to see.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.206
Let's play this out.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.281
You think it was
Darryl Crowe looking for payback?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.519
What's the alternative?

11:22.615 --> 11:25.027
Art did shoot Theo Tonin not so long ago.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.064
Thirty years after Drew Thompson did that,

11:27.153 --> 11:29.030
he was still mad enough
to drop bodies about it.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.033
Well, the good news is'
if we want to question Theo,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.797
he ain't hard to find. How about Darryl?

11:32.892 --> 11:34.997
We're looking. KSP went by Audry's.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.869
- Place was shutdown.
- Well, there you go.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.708
Why's he run, he ain't the shooter?

11:38.798 --> 11:40.709
I imagine where he's from,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.644
even suspected cop shooters
don't tend to get arrested.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.248
Yeah, but how's a man
even know he's a suspect?

11:47.173 --> 11:49.551
Well, doesn't lake
a genius to know he'll be top of our list.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.815
Day after a marshal kills his brother,

11:51.878 --> 11:53.380
somebody takes a shot at the chief.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.049
Art's face is all over the news.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.854
You saying you think he ran
even though it wasn't him that did it?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.988
I'm saying we have to consider it.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.993
All right, I've considered it.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.229
Whatever it is, it's not your call to make.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.273
Ed Kirkland, Detroit Chief,

12:09.429 --> 12:11.204
he's coming in to head up the investigation,

12:11.264 --> 12:12.902
run the office for the time being.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.273
Makes sense. He and Art go back.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.210
He also goes back with the Tonins,

12:16.269 --> 12:20.012
which means Theo
will probably be his first instinct.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.053
So we follow his lead.

12:23.843 --> 12:27.757
<i>Dr Wallace to the O.R.</i>

12:29.082 --> 12:31.028
Kirkland's due within the hour.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.961
After that, our options shrink.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.890
You talking about any particular option?

12:34.954 --> 12:37.059
The one where we catch up with Darryl...

12:37.890 --> 12:39.369
Out in the wild world.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.595
You'd be on board for that?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.302
It's Art.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.602
- You think that's what he would want?
- I think he'd do it for us.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.111
All due respect, Tim,

12:51.804 --> 12:53.875
I don't think you know Art as well as I do.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.556
I got to go explain to Mr Picker

13:05.752 --> 13:09.131
and Mr Duffy how
we come to lose half that shipment.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.761
We didn't lose it.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.630
Well, I'll make sure to tell them that.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.802
And while I'm gone,

13:17.730 --> 13:19.937
- I want you to hide that dope.
- Where?

13:20.066 --> 13:21.909
I don't know. And I don't want to know.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.241
It's gonna be my insurance.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.905
Insurance for what?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.917
For walking out of that hotel room.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.651
Christ, Boyd, if you're that worried about
walking out, why even walk in?

13:30.743 --> 13:34.088
Because procrastination
has never been a part of my nature.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.126
Well, at least take us with you.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.253
Shit, Boyd, they want a war?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.322
We'll stack 'em up like cordwood.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.090
Goddamn right.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.327
Son, after everything I've asked you to do,

13:46.426 --> 13:50.272
I appreciate the sentiment,
but this one's on me.

13:51.364 --> 13:54.709
But I need you to promise me

13:55.168 --> 13:57.114
that if this don't go my way...

13:57.937 --> 14:00.315
If this don't go my way...

14:00.873 --> 14:04.685
That you will take care of Ava by giving
that nurse everything she needs.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.723
Course, Boyd. But you ain't got to do this.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.554
Just hide the dope.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.819
But when I say "hide it",

14:11.884 --> 14:14.558
I want you to hide it so God can't even find it.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.859
Now get out of here.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.630
Go on.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.368
And remember what you promised.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.017
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.351
You didn't.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.392
You want me to get you
something to help you sleep?

15:18.451 --> 15:21.364
EMTs gave me enough
Lorazepam to kill a rhino.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.934
Didn't even make my eyelids heavy.

15:24.023 --> 15:26.196
Well, they didn't know
to account for your tolerance.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.398
How long am I gonna have to stay here?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.707
They didn't walk you through this?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.747
They might have. I don't think
I'm retaining much at the moment.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.994
Tonight, we don't have enough manpower
to protect you anywhere but here.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.264
In the morning, though, deputies will start
arriving from other districts.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.391
We'll detail a few lo lake you to a hotel.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.438
And then how long will I be there?

16:00.593 --> 16:03.574
Till we find the shooter
or establish you weren't the target.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.335
Did you see him?

16:07.467 --> 16:08.946
He's still in surgery.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.746
I'm sorry, Raylan.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.284
You have nothing to be sorry for.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.527
Try to get some sleep.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.864
How's Ms Brander?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.205
She's all right. She's resting.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.940
She seems like a fine young woman.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.479
Sir, I'd like to join
the manhunt for Darryl Crowe Jr.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.344
I know him, I know the family,

16:46.439 --> 16:48.180
I know the area he's likely holed up.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.015
I think we got enough bodies
on that manhunt,

16:50.109 --> 16:52.146
plus local P.D. supplementing.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.621
I imagine they know the area, as well.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.990
No, Deputy, I need you
to stay here, be my right hand.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.186
Help me get the lay of the land.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.790
Right-hand man?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.456
Yeah. Our first order of business,

17:01.521 --> 17:02.727
we go at Tonin.

17:02.822 --> 17:06.201
We establish all the ways he could've been
in contact with the outside world

17:06.492 --> 17:08.904
and talk to anyone
he could've used as a go-between.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.401
Funny.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.538
Excuse me?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.545
Art had to fly to Macon once,

17:16.636 --> 17:19.640
babysit the Georgia middle district
while their chief was suspended.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.215
Yeah, Loughlin.
Yeah, he got busted for double dipping.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.377
Yeah.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.480
Art said the top priority for an interim chief

17:26.546 --> 17:28.492
is to rein in the office problem child.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.050
Best way he knew to do that was

17:31.150 --> 17:35.189
keep the guy where he could see him,
tell him he's your right-hand man.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.860
All right, Deputy. Fair enough.
I'll be straight with you.

17:40.426 --> 17:44.101
Yes, I need to keep you close
so I can keep an eye on you.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.170
I'm concerned that
your participation in this investigation,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.578
that it may jeopardise a future prosecution.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.240
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

17:52.338 --> 17:53.942
All right, Deputy, we're done.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.184
Allow me to be straight with you, Chief.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.518
We lose the guy who did this

17:59.845 --> 18:02.689
'cause you kept me from doing my job,

18:02.748 --> 18:04.750
that's gonna be on you.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.094
Problem?

18:11.123 --> 18:12.363
Theo gave it up.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.268
Gave what up?

18:14.360 --> 18:15.964
Says he ordered the hit on An

18:16.062 --> 18:17.632
as payback for bringing him in.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.367
Signed the affidavit swearing to it.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.579
- Geez.
- It gets better.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.945
He's willing to finger the shooter.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.049
My fiancée's wedding ring.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.123
- He's clean.
- You sure?

18:35.214 --> 18:37.888
Mikey says he's clean, he's clean.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.288
Check him again.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.924
Whatever.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.736
Well, I guess there's
no question about who's calling the shots.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.296
Our social hierarchy
is the least of your concerns.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.442
Well, if you're looking for the Beretta
I usually keep in the small of my back,

18:53.566 --> 18:55.136
I decided to leave it at...

18:56.569 --> 18:57.775
Home.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.314
I figured I might get frisked.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.647
Didn't want to take a chance
on it going missing.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.515
I brought that piece back
with me from the desert.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.022
What's this?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.418
My abiding shame.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.991
I didn't know you smoked, Mr Crowder.

19:13.085 --> 19:16.692
Well, my recent anxiety
has made me question why I ever gave it up.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.168
I see we have a new face in our crowd.

19:20.259 --> 19:21.704
Have a seat, Boyd.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.006
Any place in particular?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.538
There will be fine.

19:31.937 --> 19:35.043
So, you want to explain how
your buddy the marshal

19:35.141 --> 19:36.950
came to seize half our shipment?

19:37.276 --> 19:39.119
Well, seeing how it wasn't in my possession,

19:39.178 --> 19:42.455
I think that's more
of a question for Darryl Crowe Jr.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.392
- And where is he?
- I can't say.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.029
But if I were him, I'd be running for my life.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.531
You heard somebody
shot the chief marshal last night?

19:49.622 --> 19:50.965
And you think it's Darryl?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.502
I don't know. I wasn't there.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.365
But if I was a betting man...

19:54.460 --> 19:57.031
Since you are the one
who's here at the moment, Boyd,

19:57.129 --> 19:59.473
why don't you explain on Darryl's behalf?

19:59.565 --> 20:02.637
Mr Picker, the only explaining

20:02.702 --> 20:04.545
I've ever done in my life

20:04.637 --> 20:08.312
was to my mama when
she caught me sneaking in after my curfew.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.846
And you ain't my mama.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.687
But I'll indulge you

20:13.145 --> 20:15.250
with a short answer 10 your question.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.384
Shit happens, Mr Picker.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.558
What about the other half?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.360
Sometimes it don't.
- Where is it?

20:22.421 --> 20:24.094
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

20:24.857 --> 20:26.734
What do you mean exactly
by you "don't know"?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.864
Well, Mr Picker, what I mean is...

20:30.863 --> 20:32.843
If I die in this hotel room,

20:32.898 --> 20:35.071
it'll be like you decided
to bury the rest of that dope

20:35.167 --> 20:36.544
right alongside me.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.522
Tell me about yourself, Mr Crowder.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.014
- She speaks.
- I do.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.027
Well, I usually like lo know a person's name

20:51.083 --> 20:53.427
before I start telling them my life story.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.931
Hale, Katherine Hale.

20:56.555 --> 20:59.297
As in the wife of "big country" Grady Hale?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.428
Widow.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.529
Wynn Duffy, lam impressed.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.607
I remember seeing
a picture of you in the paper

21:06.699 --> 21:08.269
when your husband was on trial,

21:08.367 --> 21:10.938
and I thought,
"Now, that is the kind of woman"

21:11.036 --> 21:13.880
"you get on your arm
when you become a real gangster."

21:14.406 --> 21:17.546
Of course, that was some time ago,
and you've changed your hair.

21:17.877 --> 21:21.290
Wynn brought me here
just especially to meet you.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.825
Thinking that any friend of his
ought to be a friend of mine?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.624
No. He wants to know

21:26.719 --> 21:30.667
if I can come up
with a reason why he shouldn't kill you.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.233
Other than my winning personality?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.239
Well...

21:39.064 --> 21:42.136
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have a cigarette

21:42.234 --> 21:46.410
while I think of an earnest
answer to your question.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.583
It's not so much me as the hotel.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.416
This is a non-smoking suite.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.521
US Marshals! On the ground right now!

21:53.612 --> 21:55.319
- Right now!
- On the ground.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.451
- Right now!
- Right now! Get up!

21:58.250 --> 22:02.630
Well, I guess this hotel takes that
non-smoking policy pretty serious, Mr Duffy.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.536
You must know this is bullshit.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.768
All I know is we have to follow it up.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.834
Washington.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.277
Excuse me.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.340
Why would Tonin
try to help us without cutting a deal?

22:19.438 --> 22:21.213
Because he knows we'd never deal with him.

22:21.307 --> 22:23.116
- That's my point.
- Sir.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.186
Deputy Brooks wanted you to see this.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.848
It lists who got caught in the net
when we grabbed Picker.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.017
Katherine Hale?

22:29.114 --> 22:31.060
That's what her drivers license said.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.452
- That name doesn't mean anything to you?
- Should it?

22:33.719 --> 22:36.029
Tonin just wants to get us chasing bullshit.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.634
It's the only entertainment he's got.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.727
- Where is she now?
Downstairs.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.202
Downstairs in this building?

22:41.293 --> 22:43.204
Yes, sir. Her, Crowder, Duffy, his bodyguard.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.639
We figure we could
at least hold them a couple hours.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.304
- Where's Deputy Brooks?
- She's sitting on them.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.674
Course she is. Come with me.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.075
I'm gonna go in there.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.349
Finally, someone I can reason with.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.889
- I want a name.
- Me, too.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.482
The scrawny guy. Who is he?

23:02.581 --> 23:04.754
I want a name. I want an apology.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.763
That rat-faced little prick tweaked my back
when I was getting in the car.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.063
It's like he doesn't understand
the special relationship

23:10.155 --> 23:11.225
I have with you guys.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.325
That relationship, that's over.

23:13.993 --> 23:14.994
Really?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.040
Today, we got a different set of problems.

23:17.596 --> 23:18.700
Yeah.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.068
I heard. My condolences.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.572
Seriously.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.347
Still don't know how I fit in.

23:25.504 --> 23:26.881
Well, Theo puts you as the shooter.

23:27.706 --> 23:28.912
Beautiful.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.851
He says you were acting on his orders.

23:31.343 --> 23:34.756
Really? Well, the last time you dragged me
in here, you thought he was trying to kill me.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.724
Now you believe I'm taking his orders?

23:36.782 --> 23:39.092
More than believe. Got the proof.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.228
Got all we need, matter of fact.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.126
Congratulations.

23:43.389 --> 23:44.891
You're the prime suspect.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.430
Show me what the hell you got.

23:46.525 --> 23:47.731
You'll hear it in court.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.203
This again?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.805
The land of complete bullshit?

23:50.896 --> 23:52.933
You guys really should learn
a new tune, you know that?

23:53.032 --> 23:55.535
You're looking at 40 years to life, my buddy.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.608
Yeah. More if Art dies.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.275
That case,
you're gonna regret you left Michigan,

24:01.373 --> 24:04.217
as Kentucky does
still favour the death penalty.

24:05.544 --> 24:06.955
- I played ball.
- Yes, you did.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.423
I played ball, Marshal.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.387
And now you're gonna hang this job on me?

24:10.549 --> 24:11.619
- Very simple.
- Come on.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.560
Goes away. You give me a name.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.890
I'm not a snitch.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.729
I got an affidavit says you are.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.128
- Why should I help you?
- Again?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.336
Believe I made that more than clear.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.066
No, I mean, why would I help you besides

24:24.129 --> 24:25.631
the fact that you're an asshole?

24:25.731 --> 24:27.404
There is no other reason.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.481
Darryl Crowe is what I heard.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.248
Mr Picker. Been a while.

24:40.679 --> 24:41.851
Chief.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.426
Funny running into you here.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.920
It's like running into
an old teacher at the movies.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.089
You hear what he said?

24:47.152 --> 24:48.654
You think I need corroboration

24:48.754 --> 24:50.427
from a bent-nosed
arm-breaker from Greek town?

24:50.489 --> 24:51.695
That hurt.

24:51.857 --> 24:54.599
Now, I said we had to follow
it up, and we did.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.774
Having a little trouble
locating Mr Darryl Crowe today.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.504
- Can you get a line on him?
- I met the man once.

25:00.599 --> 25:01.771
Okay, say you want to meet him again.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.711
Tell him you like
the way he fills out his wife beater.

25:03.802 --> 25:04.940
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.979
Just let us know when and where.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.446
And what do I get?

25:12.311 --> 25:14.518
Prizes to be named later.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.658
That's the prick.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.365
Time stamp from the hotel camera

25:24.456 --> 25:26.402
puts him in the lobby
three minutes after Art's shot.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.699
Jeff Gordon couldn't make
that drive in less than 10.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.705
That's what you pulled us out for.
To tell us he didn't do it?

25:30.796 --> 25:32.366
- That's not why I pulled you out.
- Hold on.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.534
Raylan, you got a call.

25:33.732 --> 25:34.870
Jesus. Can it wait?

25:34.967 --> 25:37.538
It's Darryl Crowds sister.
Says he wants to turn himself in.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.181
Great. She knows where we are.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.551
Says he'll only turn himself in to you.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.698
You can take those off.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.568
You have your gun.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.265
Yes, you have your gun.

26:06.532 --> 26:09.741
- Well, hello, David.
- Katherine.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.714
Don't remember asking you to sit.

26:12.771 --> 26:16.014
Well, you didn't ask me
to come down here, either.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.384
Standing while you sit would make me feel
like we were back in court.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.286
Believe you have me
confused with the judge.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.518
No.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.716
I remember which one you were.

26:25.517 --> 26:28.430
Smug little hobbit-looking beaner shitbird

26:28.520 --> 26:30.591
who told the jury what a no-account savage

26:30.689 --> 26:34.569
my late husband was and that I was worse.

26:34.893 --> 26:38.272
Well, glad to see the years
haven't taken away your silver tongue.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.601
She tell you anything
about why she was at Duffy's hotel suite?

26:41.700 --> 26:43.941
"Visiting an old family friend.
Is that a crime?"

26:44.036 --> 26:47.711
Well, not compared
to racketeering, conspiracy, and murder, no.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.119
Well, whatever dark,

26:51.210 --> 26:54.555
twisted fantasies you have about me, David,

26:54.980 --> 27:00.487
rest assured, now I am
nothing but a little ol' country grandma.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.565
Don't look like any grandma I ever saw.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.899
Course, both my grandmas looked
like Edward James Olmos.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.902
So, is there anything else?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.907
Because my lawyers on his way.

27:10.996 --> 27:14.842
I guess we could
rev up the old harassment suit.

27:14.933 --> 27:16.844
No, no, no. No harassment.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.410
I just wanted to see you. For old times' sake.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.147
You believe it?

27:22.241 --> 27:25.313
Most of the people in this office
are too new to know who you are.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.855
You're disappointed, aren't you?

27:29.948 --> 27:31.757
That people don't know who you are?

27:31.817 --> 27:33.854
That I'm still alive.

27:34.686 --> 27:36.825
Yeah. A little bit.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.840
Jesus Christ. Your face.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.105
You didn't come alone.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.508
- What happened?
- Did you come alone?

27:51.703 --> 27:52.977
What do you think?

27:53.038 --> 27:55.177
I think you probably got a half dozen guys

27:55.274 --> 27:57.185
stacked up behind you
at the top of the staircase,

27:57.276 --> 27:59.620
another dozen outside
covering the windows.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.952
Don't forget the snipers.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.288
Where is he?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.385
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.222
Step back.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.533
Have a seat on the bed.

28:13.625 --> 28:14.865
He had Kendal.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.167
Said if I didn't help arrange his surrender,

28:17.963 --> 28:20.637
cops would catch up to him sooner or later.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.079
Kendal was likely
to get caught up in the crossfire.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.680
So you arranged the meeting, and then what?

28:30.909 --> 28:33.480
- He change his mind?
- I doubt it.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.715
Then, again...

28:36.148 --> 28:37.354
Where is he?

28:38.016 --> 28:39.689
He was afraid you'd shoot him on sight.

28:39.818 --> 28:41.729
He said he wasn't
even gonna come out in the open

28:41.820 --> 28:43.663
unless he knew exactly where you'd be.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.562
So you made sure I was here.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.099
I suppose it should be heart-warming,

28:48.193 --> 28:50.571
seeing you choose
the brother who's given you nothing but pain

28:50.662 --> 28:52.767
over the lawman you swore
you'd betray him to.

28:53.365 --> 28:56.107
Well, a let's happened
since I made you that promise.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.581
You know, death has a way
of bringing a family together.

28:59.871 --> 29:02.715
As I trust you're aware,
Darryl's the only brother I got left.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.184
You're gonna lay that at my feet, huh?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.084
Ain't that where it belongs?

29:06.345 --> 29:07.619
All right, Ms Crowe,

29:07.713 --> 29:10.023
you did your sisterly duty
and you lured me to a place

29:10.082 --> 29:11.390
I could be no threat.

29:11.783 --> 29:13.524
Now I want you to tell me where he is.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.065
Hey!

29:23.795 --> 29:25.866
My name is Darryl Crowe Jr.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.741
I'm here to turn myself in.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.749
Somebody grab the kid.

29:42.648 --> 29:46.824
Vasquez didn't even want us to go in there
and give the kid a soda. He's terrified.

29:46.918 --> 29:48.659
Darryl's lawyer
will say that we tried to talk to the kid

29:48.754 --> 29:50.597
without a guardian present,

29:50.656 --> 29:52.067
get him disqualified as a witness.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.465
How about Darryl himself?
We talking to him?

29:54.559 --> 29:56.505
Kirkland and Vasquez are in there with him.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.841
Guess he must've waived the attorney.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.739
He's probably waiting for his sister.

30:10.075 --> 30:11.645
Can't be good.

30:13.578 --> 30:14.784
I want to see my brother.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.086
In a moment, Ms Crowe. First I need...

30:16.315 --> 30:18.352
You best not be
talking to him without representation.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.088
Otherwise, I'm gonna see to...
- Ms Crowe!

30:21.753 --> 30:23.630
At the moment,
I am not interested in your brother.

30:24.589 --> 30:26.466
At least, not that one.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.332
Kendal.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.929
I'm not her brother. I'm her son.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.866
Long story.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.307
Okay, Kendal.

30:37.936 --> 30:41.679
Your brother, or your uncle,

30:42.874 --> 30:45.684
he said that you had
something you wanted to tell us.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.353
I didn't mean to hurt that old man.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.633
It just happened so fast.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.403
I would've thought you'd
gotten the hole for sure.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.003
Nah. I just had to go to
Montgomery's office for an hour,

31:11.136 --> 31:13.309
listening to him tell me how I am out

31:13.405 --> 31:15.578
'cause I'm afraid
of realising my full potential.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.546
Any idea what ended the lockdown?

31:19.644 --> 31:21.749
Search came up empty, and no one's talking.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.591
Their move now is to wait and see

31:23.682 --> 31:25.889
who Judith's girls target for retaliation.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.893
Maybe they don't know who did it, either.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.431
Come on, Ava.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.762
Their asses might be dumb,
but they ain't no dumbasses.

31:32.023 --> 31:34.264
They'll put this together
with their eyes closed.

31:34.359 --> 31:37.203
Your best hope now
is that I'm not the only one of Judith's girls

31:37.262 --> 31:39.173
who wanted to see her taken out.

31:43.869 --> 31:46.406
Well, guess if this is my last meal,

31:46.938 --> 31:49.544
I ought to be grateful that it's ice cream day.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.849
Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you.
How'd you get two?

31:52.277 --> 31:54.188
I batted my eyelashes.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.024
Best eat up.

32:35.987 --> 32:38.126
So, how did you get there? Hitch?

32:38.223 --> 32:40.134
Drove. Known how since I was 11.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.735
How about the gun? Where did you get that?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.673
Mr Vasquez, I want to
make sure the record reflects

32:45.764 --> 32:48.074
that although my client
is making this statement

32:48.133 --> 32:49.578
against the advice of counsel...

32:49.634 --> 32:51.739
Mr Wagner, we've been over this.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.614
Counsel nonetheless expects the state

32:53.738 --> 32:56.344
to take his voluntary
cooperation into account

32:56.575 --> 32:58.646
during charging and sentencing phases.

32:58.743 --> 32:59.744
Noted.

33:00.245 --> 33:01.690
Kendal, please, continue.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.760
I asked where you got the gun.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.086
It was my uncle Danny's.

33:07.085 --> 33:08.428
Figured he'd want me to have it

33:08.587 --> 33:10.533
now that he wasn't gonna be
around to protect me.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.293
Why did you bring it with you?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.768
You said you were there
only to talk to Ms Brander.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.471
Why'd you feel necessity to be armed?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.602
Law's been hounding my family for years.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.374
They don't care we ain't done nothing.

33:24.636 --> 33:28.277
Just like they think
the world would be better off without us.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.814
Now they went and put
my uncle Danny down like a dog.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.684
Matter of time
before they come to me the same way.

33:35.881 --> 33:38.725
I just wanted to be ready.
Protect my mom, me.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.889
What happened when you
arrived at Ms Branders building?

33:45.223 --> 33:47.794
Go up to the door,
just like that other time I came to see her.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.230
Only, this time,
when I reached out to ring the bell,

33:50.328 --> 33:53.002
the door started to open, all on its own.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.305
Did you recognise Chief Mullen?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.707
All I saw was the star on his belt.

33:58.169 --> 34:00.149
Same kind as on the man who killed Danny.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.712
Thought maybe it was
the same man there for me,

34:02.807 --> 34:04.582
looking to bury me beside my uncle.

34:06.411 --> 34:09.255
Sol put my hand on my gun, just to be ready.

34:09.481 --> 34:10.983
You know, just in case.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.989
But I wasn't gonna do anything.

34:15.487 --> 34:18.730
But the man with the star,
he gets surprised seeing me out there.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.065
Goes to draw himself.

34:21.993 --> 34:24.098
I'm not sure which one of us fired first.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.670
'Cause, like I said, it all happened so fast.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.344
All I know is, I didn't want to hurt anybody.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.414
I just didn't want to die.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.949
Leave my mama all alone.

34:46.618 --> 34:49.257
I got to say, you got
some real balls coming back in here.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.355
Mr Picker.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.760
Well, if we don't have this conversation
today, we're gonna have it tomorrow

34:54.859 --> 34:56.270
or the day after tomorrow.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.536
And all things being equal, Mr Picker,

34:58.597 --> 35:00.304
I'd rather just get it done.

35:00.398 --> 35:01.775
I believe you were at the point

35:01.866 --> 35:04.369
where you were explaining
why you should live.

35:05.537 --> 35:09.383
And if my memory serves,
I was about to have a cigarette.

35:11.576 --> 35:12.577
Now...

35:13.545 --> 35:15.889
All due respect, Mrs Hale,

35:16.715 --> 35:18.558
I don't believe it's you

35:20.418 --> 35:21.920
I owe an explanation to.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.560
And, Mr Duffy,

35:25.991 --> 35:29.165
I apologise for the failures
of our business endeavours.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.501
But that being said, there ain't no way in hell

35:32.597 --> 35:34.770
I'm gonna beg you for my life.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.944
But you are owed something.

35:38.069 --> 35:41.949
So, what say I give you half
of my half of the shipment

35:42.007 --> 35:43.680
and we go our separate ways?

35:45.410 --> 35:47.083
- We don't need this guy.
- Quiet.

35:49.914 --> 35:52.417
I'm real low, Boyd.
Half of half doesn't make me whole.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.425
I understand.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.797
Our friends in Mexico are furious

35:58.189 --> 36:00.100
about the bullshit
that happened in the desert.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.296
I need you to be quiet. I need you to stop.

36:01.359 --> 36:02.929
They're this close to sending
a goddamn hit squad here.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.838
I say we put Boyd Crowder's
head in a goddamn box!

36:05.930 --> 36:07.307
- Mr Picker!
- Wynn.

36:21.446 --> 36:22.823
You want a cigarette, Mr Picker?

36:22.881 --> 36:24.519
You seem awful nervous.

36:24.616 --> 36:25.788
My nerves are fine.

36:26.451 --> 36:29.022
Well, are you sure?

36:30.388 --> 36:32.664
'Cause nicotine can be a powerful relaxant.

36:37.495 --> 36:38.633
Shit'll kill you.

36:49.474 --> 36:51.317
That ringing in your ears?

36:51.543 --> 36:54.490
That's two ounces of Emulex
on a 10-second timer.

36:54.746 --> 36:56.748
Now, I may not know a lot
about a lot of things,

36:56.848 --> 36:59.192
but I do know how to blow shit up.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.526
Now, my offer still stands, Mr Duffy,

37:02.587 --> 37:05.329
half of my half.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.666
Mike.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.336
Lock the door.

37:19.838 --> 37:20.873
Now.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.179
Sir?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.247
Mind shutting that door?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.695
You leaving us already?

37:37.756 --> 37:39.633
Yeah, now that we got
a confession on the shooting,

37:39.724 --> 37:40.862
director wants me back north.

37:41.392 --> 37:43.303
Got my own office to run.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.375
I'd appreciate if you'd keep me in the loop
on Art and his condition.

37:46.464 --> 37:47.442
Of course.

37:47.532 --> 37:50.809
I'll be in touch as soon
as there's something to be in touch about.

37:52.537 --> 37:55.279
Any idea who they're sending here
to take your place?

37:55.373 --> 37:56.374
They're not.

37:57.742 --> 38:01.121
As you know, as chiefs,
we have to set aside recommendations

38:01.212 --> 38:03.317
in the event we ever become incapacitated.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.491
Directors inclined
to agree with Art's choice for interim chief.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.220
Which is whom?

38:10.054 --> 38:11.226
He didn't tell you?

38:12.157 --> 38:13.227
Tell me what?

38:21.966 --> 38:23.411
Congratulations.

38:31.342 --> 38:32.446
You got it, Darryl.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.614
How's that?

38:33.678 --> 38:36.352
Well, you wanted this
to come down to you and me.

38:36.614 --> 38:37.752
Now you got it.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.160
You ain't got no right to talk to me like that.

38:40.251 --> 38:43.460
I'm a grieving man fresh off
putting my brother in the ground.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.000
I got another on the way to juvie.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.431
You mean "nephew".

38:48.760 --> 38:51.502
And a sister I need to keep
from losing her damn mind.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.769
You gonna tell me your sad story?

38:54.799 --> 38:56.540
Let me tell you a different one.

38:57.502 --> 39:01.040
Let me tell you the story
of how you went to Alison's,

39:01.139 --> 39:03.551
planned to use her to draw me over
to show it down.

39:03.641 --> 39:05.643
"Show it down"? What? Like cowboys?

39:05.777 --> 39:07.313
You got startled by Art,

39:07.445 --> 39:10.016
started blasting without thinking
'cause you're a chickenshit

39:10.114 --> 39:11.889
who ain't used to doing his dirty work.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.690
That's sad, as in pathetic.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.958
But where it gets real tragic

39:16.020 --> 39:20.799
is when you saw on the news
who it was you shot and panicked,

39:21.059 --> 39:26.031
grabbed Kendal, and somehow convinced
him to throw away his life to save yours.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.803
Man, you crazy.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.640
Lawyer just said he ain't gonna do more
than a few years.

39:30.702 --> 39:34.047
Playing it like you don't know what juvie's
liable to do to a boy like Kendal.

39:34.472 --> 39:36.884
No chance he comes out
the same as he went in.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.319
Good. He could use some toughening up.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.748
Sorry to say I let him go pussy.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.819
Well, I'm just letting you know
how this is gonna go.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.690
Yeah? How's it gonna go?

39:46.818 --> 39:48.729
I'm gonna walk up out of here. What?
You gonna shoot me?

39:48.820 --> 39:50.527
I ain't gonna kill you, Darryl.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.593
Doesn't mean I don't want to.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.230
Well, that's real complicated.

39:57.328 --> 39:58.398
Your luck.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.908
You shot the one man
makes a difference to me.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.342
Yeah?

40:02.834 --> 40:04.370
He makes a difference?

40:04.502 --> 40:05.674
What? Like my brother made to me?

40:07.171 --> 40:08.241
Did it feel like that?

40:10.341 --> 40:11.342
Excuse me.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.283
Just so I'm clear...

40:17.382 --> 40:18.725
You're not gonna kill me?

40:18.850 --> 40:20.352
'Cause I was worried for a minute.

40:20.451 --> 40:21.794
- Be worried.
- Yeah?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.529
'Cause that web of bullshit
you spun around yourself

40:24.689 --> 40:25.793
to protect yourself,

40:26.724 --> 40:28.795
I'm gonna use it to strangle
the life out of you

40:29.928 --> 40:31.601
and take away everything you got.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.768
Then you're gonna wish I'd have blacked
you out with a bullet to the head.

40:35.867 --> 40:36.868
Well,

40:37.302 --> 40:40.112
this feels
like one of those "time will tell" deals,

40:40.471 --> 40:43.281
which, as a free man, I have plenty of.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.577
Question is

40:46.577 --> 40:48.915
how much time you got?
