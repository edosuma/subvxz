female narrator: Last season
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:03.264 --> 00:04.221
- We have the six totems,
but you can't fight

00:06.049 --> 00:08.182
what you can't see.
What if the only way to kill

00:08.312 --> 00:10.532
Mallus is to let him out?

00:11.881 --> 00:13.883
- Guys, we did it!
- My father's Time Stone.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.841
- He died to give you a second
chance.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.539
Don't waste it.

00:18.714 --> 00:22.370
- Whose brilliant idea was it
to let an ancient demon

00:22.413 --> 00:24.154
out of his bloody cage?

00:24.198 --> 00:26.504
Well, you opened a door, love,

00:26.548 --> 00:29.551
and Mallus wasn't
the only thing that got out.

00:34.947 --> 00:37.037
reporter: The newest
musical sensation

00:37.080 --> 00:38.429
to cross the Atlantic--

00:38.473 --> 00:40.344
a group of young men
from Liverpool

00:40.388 --> 00:42.390
who call themselves
the Beatles

00:42.433 --> 00:45.523
have just arrived at JFK.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.959
The Beatles.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.961
That's B-E-A-T,

00:49.005 --> 00:52.052
because that's the way
they keep the beat.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.186
- Hey, Z, if you had to sleep
with one,

00:56.230 --> 00:57.709
which one would it be?

00:57.753 --> 01:00.060
- How can you even
tell them apart?

01:00.103 --> 01:01.713
- Well, Paul's the cute one,

01:01.757 --> 01:04.542
George is the quiet one,
there's Ringo--

01:04.586 --> 01:06.414
- Never met an Englishman
I haven't wanted to

01:06.457 --> 01:07.458
punch in the face.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.764
- Relax, Mick,

01:08.807 --> 01:10.200
if it wasn't for
the British Invasion,

01:10.244 --> 01:11.854
there would be
no Rolling Stones,

01:11.897 --> 01:14.161
no Led Zep,

01:14.204 --> 01:16.032
no Black Sabbath.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.381
- Black Sabbath.
- Yup.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.383
- Well, then we--
we need to protect

01:19.427 --> 01:20.906
these mopheads
from whatever's

01:20.950 --> 01:22.908
screwing up history.
- That's right, Mick.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.433
- So, Gideon sent us
on a wild goose chase.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.261
This event in history
is playing out

01:27.304 --> 01:29.132
exactly as it should.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.093
- The British are coming!

01:33.136 --> 01:34.703
The British are coming!

01:34.746 --> 01:36.139
- Interesting fact:
the real Paul Revere didn't

01:36.183 --> 01:38.924
actually say--
Oh, my God, it's Paul Revere!

01:38.968 --> 01:41.971
- I got this.

01:42.014 --> 01:45.148
Where am I? Why are
all those women screaming?

01:45.192 --> 01:47.672
- And now for the midnight ride
of Ray Revere.

01:47.716 --> 01:48.717
Sorry.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.022
Nate Revere to the rescue.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.808
- Now ring the alarm
back in 1775.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.115
- I got a country to save,
suckers!

01:55.158 --> 01:56.812
- See ya back on the ship,
Nate.

01:56.855 --> 01:59.119
- The British are coming!
The British are coming!

01:59.162 --> 02:00.642
Whoo!

02:02.687 --> 02:05.995
♪

02:16.048 --> 02:17.398
Oh, come on.

02:17.441 --> 02:20.662
We just met the Beatles
and saved Fourth of July.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.752
- No, it's cool;
it's just all becoming...

02:23.795 --> 02:25.841
I don't know.
Old hat.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.930
- Yeah, we did spend all
of last night year returning

02:27.973 --> 02:29.845
displaced people to
their proper place in history.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.803
- Four years
doing the same old crap.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.023
- Yeah, I'm beginning to think
Wally had the right idea--

02:34.066 --> 02:37.766
taking time off, clearing
his head, traveling the world.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.028
Speaking of the same old crap,

02:39.071 --> 02:40.769
isn't that what
he did last year?

02:40.812 --> 02:43.206
- Look, all I know is,
Constantine promised us new,

02:43.250 --> 02:46.557
mysterious monsters,
so where they all hiding?

02:46.601 --> 02:48.211
- I'm confused.

02:48.255 --> 02:51.910
We are all happy that there
was only one dragon, right?

02:51.954 --> 02:53.564
We don't want to be fighting
werewolves in the Alamo.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.044
- Eh.

02:55.087 --> 02:58.221
- Well, it would be
good for our ratings.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.790
The Time Bureau
rates all their employees.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.575
But don't worry.
We have a few dedicated fans.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.229
- Yeah, Gary doesn't count.

03:06.273 --> 03:09.580
- Who gives a damn
about Time Pig ratings?

03:09.624 --> 03:11.582
I want dragons.

03:13.105 --> 03:16.239
Don't you get it?
Constantine was wrong.

03:16.283 --> 03:19.721
Our crazy plan
to let Mallus out worked.

03:19.764 --> 03:20.983
Finally, we're not screw-ups

03:21.026 --> 03:22.854
forced to clean up
our own mess.

03:22.898 --> 03:27.816
For once in our lives,
we are actual heroes.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.384
- Captain,
I'm receiving a communiqué

03:30.427 --> 03:32.081
from Director Sharpe.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.866
all: Ooh!

03:34.910 --> 03:36.303
- Put her on, Gideon.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.915
- Captain Lance,

03:39.958 --> 03:41.308
I would like
you and your team to report

03:41.351 --> 03:43.223
to the Time Bureau immediately.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.615
- Copy that.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.269
Gideon, set a course
for Star City-

03:46.313 --> 03:48.140
- I'm not talking about
our field office, Miss Lance.

03:48.184 --> 03:51.274
I meant our Time Bureau
Headquarters in D.C.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.406
Over and out.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.278
- Dammit!

03:55.322 --> 03:57.802
Who told Ava about the dragon?

04:07.421 --> 04:10.032
- You sure that you can't
tell us what all this is about?

04:10.075 --> 04:12.295
- Oh, I'd love to,
but the boss-lady will kill me.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.557
- Mick.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.559
- Talk.

04:15.603 --> 04:16.995
- I can't.
Director Sharpe said--

04:17.039 --> 04:18.519
- Whatever Ava threatened
is nothing

04:18.562 --> 04:20.347
compared to what
I'm about to do to you.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.783
- You told her about the dragon
head, didn't you, Gary?

04:21.826 --> 04:23.524
No.
- Did Constantine

04:23.567 --> 04:24.960
get you to squeal?
- I wish.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.788
- We looked;
there are no more monsters.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.312
- This isn't what you think.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.446
Then what the hell is it?

04:32.489 --> 04:34.361
all: Surprise!

04:38.495 --> 04:40.976
- On behalf of the Time Bureau,
I would like to recognize

04:41.019 --> 04:45.676
Captain Lance and her crew for
fixing the final Anachronism.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.895
Congratulations!

04:52.596 --> 04:54.163
- Well, it means that...

04:54.206 --> 04:56.078
Paul Revere was

04:56.121 --> 04:57.427
the final crack
in the timeline.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.908
You, my friends,
fixed history.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.824
- The same history we broke.
- Just take the win.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.739
- I don't want
your stinking medal.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.306
- There's an open bar.

05:11.006 --> 05:14.183
- Sorry, Sara, I know you don't
like surprises, but...

05:14.226 --> 05:16.228
- I like this one.

05:16.272 --> 05:19.580
Now I was thinking maybe
you could give me a tour

05:19.623 --> 05:22.234
of the Headquarters,
Director Sharpe.

05:25.629 --> 05:30.678
♪

05:30.721 --> 05:32.897
- Gee, I really wonder how

05:32.941 --> 05:36.379
she managed to escape
from the Time Bureau.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.772
- Yeah...

05:39.556 --> 05:41.471
I mean--I mean,
if I had to--

05:41.515 --> 05:42.907
if I had to guess,

05:42.951 --> 05:46.911
I'd probably say that someone
must have given Nora

05:46.955 --> 05:48.348
her dead father's Time Stone.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.828
And furthermore,
that someone must have done it

05:50.872 --> 05:53.701
in hopes that she would
turn over a new leaf in life.

05:53.744 --> 05:57.269
- Sounds like that someone
forgot about Nora's serious

05:57.313 --> 06:01.448
lack of ethics--around
a murder, for one...

06:02.623 --> 06:04.842
But that someone must have had

06:04.886 --> 06:08.019
a really big heart
to give her a second chance.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.980
You're a good guy,
Ray Palmer.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.553
- Okay, I gotta go.
- No, no, no...

06:19.596 --> 06:21.337
- Yes,
I gotta get back to the ship.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.165
The Legends aren't
used to being on furlough.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.950
- Come on, they will
be fine for one night.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.257
Besides, I was hoping that you

06:28.300 --> 06:31.565
and your team would be spending
more time here in 2018.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.697
But mostly, you know...

06:33.741 --> 06:36.396
You, with me...

06:38.702 --> 06:40.443
In this apartment.

06:40.487 --> 06:43.359
- Ava Sharpe.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.230
Are you trying
to make a kept woman out of me?

06:45.274 --> 06:48.146
What? No!
I wouldn't dare.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.148
I'm...
just...

06:50.192 --> 06:51.889
saying that, you know,

06:51.933 --> 06:53.456
since you fixed
all the Anachronisms

06:53.500 --> 06:56.633
maybe you wouldn't mind
being kept,

06:56.677 --> 07:00.028
just part of the time.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.117
It would be fun
to come home to you.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.863
I'm sorry.

07:08.906 --> 07:11.474
Oh, that was stupid.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.171
You just got back into town,
and here I am hitching

07:13.215 --> 07:15.435
the old U-Haul
to the back of the Subaru.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.219
It was stupid.
No, no.

07:17.262 --> 07:21.005
Hey, it wasn't that.
I'm...

07:21.049 --> 07:23.660
I'm just thinking and...

07:23.704 --> 07:27.229
I'm ready
to take the next step.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.188
I...

07:30.232 --> 07:32.016
am ready

07:32.060 --> 07:35.411
to be a partially
kept woman.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.894
Come here.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.809
Mm. Mm!

07:41.852 --> 07:44.812
Okay, so why don't you,
uh, rustle us up

07:44.855 --> 07:46.161
another bottle of champagne,

07:46.204 --> 07:47.510
and let's make this thing
official.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.469
- That, I can do.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.876
- Hello, John.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.706
- You know, tonight
really isn't

08:09.750 --> 08:12.013
a night for celebration,
Sara.

08:12.056 --> 08:15.190
The darkness, it's rising.

08:17.148 --> 08:19.934
And what does that even mean?

08:19.977 --> 08:22.197
- Mallus wasn't the only
prisoner to escape

08:22.240 --> 08:25.461
when you decided to pull back
the veil between our worlds.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.723
- And yet
for the past five months,

08:26.767 --> 08:28.246
the Timeline has been quiet.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.857
If you wanted
to come and see me,

08:29.900 --> 08:31.075
all you had to do was ask.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.730
- Five months
is a blink of an eye

08:33.774 --> 08:36.907
for an immortal monster.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.430
Look, this is
your bloody mess, Sara,

08:38.474 --> 08:40.215
so stop playing
tiddlywinks with the missus

08:40.258 --> 08:41.912
and get ready
for the fight that's coming.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.919
This is who you are?

08:48.963 --> 08:53.881
Fuzzy throws
and fluffy pink slippers?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.015
- I like my pink
fluffy slippers.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.583
- Okay, reunion's over.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.671
Time to go.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.074
- The knuckle bones
of a martyred saint, obviously.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.859
They act as a divining rod
able to detect the presence

09:15.903 --> 09:18.340
of beings not
belonging to our world.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.516
- My team spent the last five
months scouring the Timeline

09:20.560 --> 09:22.387
for another one of your
mystical creatures.

09:22.431 --> 09:26.478
you wanna know what we found?
Nothing.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.220
- What the hell
are you doing here?

09:33.050 --> 09:34.574
- Yeah, everything is great.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.359
- I was just telling Sara--
- About an exorcism

09:37.402 --> 09:39.404
that he has to do
tomorrow in Georgetown.

09:39.448 --> 09:43.191
It's really nothing
you wanna hear before bedtime.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.845
Come back again soon now, John.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.021
Don't be shy
about that doorbell.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.458
- I'll be seeing
you around, Sharpie.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.769
- Should I be worried
about your ex-lover breaking

09:55.812 --> 09:57.901
into my apartment, or...

09:57.945 --> 10:00.208
- Well, I thought that...

10:00.251 --> 10:02.732
this was our apartment.

10:02.776 --> 10:06.606
You are smooth.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.305
Don't forget the bubbly.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.623
Bollocks.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.803
- Mick,
what are you still doing here?

10:29.846 --> 10:31.065
- Machine's still spinning,

10:31.108 --> 10:32.544
and I'm still standing.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.068
Hook me up with one of those.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.591
Now that we fixed
our last Anachronism,

10:35.635 --> 10:37.375
it's only a matter of time
before the Bureau

10:37.419 --> 10:40.335
puts us out to pasture,
which blows,

10:40.378 --> 10:42.424
because being a Legend was
the only thing I was good at.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.078
- Well, speak for yourself.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.688
I was a great criminal.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.690
- At least we got
these cool medals.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.214
- Actually, the medal
has to remain top secret,

10:50.258 --> 10:51.781
because no one can know
about time travel,

10:51.825 --> 10:53.435
so I'll just take these
back now for safe-keeping--

10:53.478 --> 10:56.351
- What do you say you
and I find some real action?

10:56.394 --> 10:58.875
- Mick,
I am 100% down.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.747
- Ooh! I'll come with.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.584
- I could have
just called us an Uber.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.282
- You ready
to steal something pretty?

11:14.325 --> 11:17.415
yeah.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.939
I could do some light theft.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.375
- What is this,
spring break?

11:20.418 --> 11:22.029
I'm talking about a felony.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.335
Now get in!

11:24.379 --> 11:26.163
If we're gonna rob a house,
we really should

11:26.207 --> 11:28.296
make sure there's stuff
in there worth stealing.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.515
And I think I know
just the neighborhood.

11:39.394 --> 11:42.310
- Mick, wait, wait, wait!
You are so aggressive.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.704
Why don't you look
for a spare key?

11:44.747 --> 11:47.054
- Good spotting, pretty.
- Yeah.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.360
I'm a real criminal mastermind.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.722
Bingo.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.123
- Yes,
I'd like to report a robbery.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.343
- You will
do nothing of the sort.

12:15.386 --> 12:19.216
Oh, Nate,
it is so good to see you!

12:19.260 --> 12:21.392
- What the hell
is going on here?

12:21.436 --> 12:24.395
- Um, Mick...
these are my parents.

12:24.439 --> 12:28.486
- I am Dorothy Heywood;
you can call me Dot. Hi.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.054
- And uh, this is my dad, Hank.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.056
- Henry Heywood.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.711
And I believe
one of my great grandmother's

12:35.755 --> 12:39.367
silver candlesticks has
found its way into your coat.

12:40.890 --> 12:44.764
- Oh, you have exquisite
taste in silver, Mr....

12:44.807 --> 12:46.548
- Rory. Mick Rory,

12:46.591 --> 12:48.724
of the Central City Rorys.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.204
- We didn't mean
to scare you, Mom.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.858
I thought you'd be up by
Martha's Vineyard

12:51.901 --> 12:53.207
this time of year.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.730
- Oh, we were!
But your father just took

12:54.774 --> 12:57.254
a very exciting job
at the Pentagon.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.430
- We'll--we'll get going,
right, Mick?

12:59.474 --> 13:02.390
- Good idea.
- Don't be ridiculous.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.306
Mr. Rory,
do you like sandwiches?

13:05.349 --> 13:06.481
- Bet your ass, I do ma'am.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.917
- Wonderful, then, um,

13:07.961 --> 13:10.528
I'm gonna fix you boys
a little midnight snack.

13:10.572 --> 13:13.662
You too, Henry;
you're one of the boys.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.841
- Gary, wake up!

13:20.625 --> 13:23.193
- I got a hunch there might
be a monster loose in history.

13:23.237 --> 13:26.109
- Like the dragon you made me
not tell Director Sharpe about?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.242
- Exactly.

13:31.593 --> 13:32.724
No.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.814
The Timeline's
only showing a few burps.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.555
This is
the only significant one.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.949
- What if there's a creature
that no one's noticed yet?

13:39.993 --> 13:42.038
- The only way people
wouldn't notice a monster is

13:42.082 --> 13:44.127
if it was hiding.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.651
- Or if they were on drugs.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.305
I'm gonna go check it out.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.133
- Ooh, I'll come with!
- Nope.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.962
- But if you're going back
to 1969, you're gonna need--

13:53.006 --> 13:54.834
- Your time courier.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.452
And don't give me any of that

14:04.495 --> 14:06.715
routine maintenance
on the jumpship crap.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.499
- Yeah, no.
I wouldn't do that.

14:08.543 --> 14:12.634
I--I had Gideon
monitor the Time Bureau.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.550
Someone over there pulled up
unusual activity in Woodstock,

14:15.593 --> 14:17.769
1969.
- You think it's Nora,

14:17.813 --> 14:19.902
and if the Time Bureau
finds her first,

14:19.946 --> 14:22.905
she's going to tell them you're
the one who helped her escape.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.777
Ray, I'm not going to let
you get on that jumpship.

14:25.821 --> 14:26.735
- But--

14:26.778 --> 14:29.869
- Not without me.
- Oh, good.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.609
I was not looking
forward to dealing

14:31.653 --> 14:33.742
with those hippies on my own.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.225
["Going up the Country"

♪ I'm goin' to some place

14:52.674 --> 14:54.458
- Give peace a chance.

14:54.502 --> 14:57.026
Together,
we can end the war in Vietnam.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.376
Hey!

14:59.420 --> 15:01.596
Yeah, this place is groovy.

15:01.639 --> 15:04.773
- So, tell me, why would
Nora Time Stone to the least

15:04.816 --> 15:07.080
evil event in history?

15:07.123 --> 15:10.257
Maybe she's turning over
a new, non-evil leaf,

15:10.300 --> 15:12.389
inspired by yours truly.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.217
- Right.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.958
- All right.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.700
- Oh, it's my old
trusty Eagle Scout compass.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.702
I thought we could locate
the epicenter of the temporal

15:20.745 --> 15:22.051
disturbance
the old-fashioned way.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.836
- It sounds like a blast, Ray.
- Yeah!

15:24.880 --> 15:28.579
- 197, 198, 199...

15:28.623 --> 15:31.843
- Sorry, Ray.
Looks like Nora's in the wind.

15:38.372 --> 15:43.943
Ray? Ray!

15:43.986 --> 15:45.422
- It's beautiful.

15:45.466 --> 15:48.251
It's like some sort of
magical pixie goo.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.601
- No, not that. That!

15:52.690 --> 15:55.650
- Oh my God! Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

15:55.693 --> 15:59.610
Why? Who would wanna
kill hippies at Woodstock?

15:59.654 --> 16:01.786
Literally ripping
people's hearts out!

16:01.830 --> 16:04.920
- Now
that's the Nora I remember.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.016
- You certainly can
eat a lot of sandwiches,

16:14.060 --> 16:15.365
Mr. Rory.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.280
Where did you get
those big muscles?

16:17.324 --> 16:20.457
- Prison.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.459
What a hoot!

16:22.503 --> 16:24.287
Isn't he a hoot, Henry?

16:24.331 --> 16:26.159
- He's a real barrel of laughs.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.813
Excuse me.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.688
- So you just drop in on us
in the middle of the night,

16:33.731 --> 16:36.343
after barely a phone call
for the past two years?

16:36.386 --> 16:37.692
- I know, Dad, I'm sorry.

16:37.735 --> 16:41.043
I've just been busy.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.089
- History stuff.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.787
You know, the same stuff
you never took seriously.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.050
- Maybe that's
because deductive historical

16:48.094 --> 16:52.141
reconstruction
isn't an actual profession!

16:53.577 --> 16:55.144
I'm sorry.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.714
So should I have your mother
just grab her checkbook

16:59.757 --> 17:02.021
now, or would you prefer
your friend here swipe it out

17:02.064 --> 17:04.284
of her purse on the way out?
- It would be easy either way.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.589
- I don't want your money, dad.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.679
- Honestly, I don't know.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.725
- You don't--

17:10.768 --> 17:12.292
we had a name
for people like you,

17:12.335 --> 17:13.771
back in my day--
- Oh.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.382
Here comes the big rant
about hippies, go ahead.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.774
- To tell the truth,

17:16.818 --> 17:18.080
I have nothing but pity
for those people.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.301
- Since they were slaughtered
like lambs back in '69.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.043
Look, I'm not saying
the Woodstock Massacre

17:24.086 --> 17:25.174
was their fault,

17:25.218 --> 17:27.742
but it wasn't
not their fault either.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.180
Mom,
thanks for the sandwiches!

17:31.224 --> 17:32.312
- Wha--

17:33.574 --> 17:35.619
- There's something wrong
with history.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.493
- Not Noras.
Hi!

17:39.536 --> 17:42.104
Not Nora, not Nora...

17:44.672 --> 17:46.717
definitely not Nora.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.763
- Ray, I really don't need
to hear your inner dialogue.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.895
- Sorry, I'm just--
I'm--I'm--I'm nervous,

17:50.939 --> 17:53.768
and upset. I mean,
how could she be so heartless?

17:53.811 --> 17:55.422
Pun not intended.

17:55.465 --> 17:58.990
- Well, her father did give her
over to a demon-loving cult so.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.777
- Hey, what are
you doing at Woodstock?

18:02.820 --> 18:04.126
- Probably the same thing
as you are,

18:04.170 --> 18:07.129
looking for whatever
is messing with history.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.828
Huh, I think I just saw
Joan Baez talking to

18:10.872 --> 18:13.657
Carlos Santana. Woodstock--

18:13.701 --> 18:16.791
- Turns into a massacre.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.272
- Yeah, buddy.

18:22.666 --> 18:26.888
- Hey!

18:26.931 --> 18:29.151
- Woodstock is no longer
remembered as three days of

18:29.195 --> 18:32.328
peace and love, but instead,
the end of the hippie movement.

18:32.372 --> 18:35.157
Reports from survivors
are sketchy at best.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.942
But what they all could agree
upon was there was a series of

18:37.986 --> 18:41.076
grisly murders that ultimately
lead to a deadly stampede

18:41.120 --> 18:43.905
when 400,000 kids try
to escape the festival at once.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.777
- Yeah, Ray and I just saw
a body in the woods

18:46.821 --> 18:48.692
with a gaping hole
in its chest.

18:48.736 --> 18:49.998
We think that Nora did it.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.652
- Well, that's a relief.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.393
- Yeah,
it means we're in the clear.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.873
Look, it's not our fault the
Time Bureau let Nora escape.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.266
- Guys, come check this out.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.094
- Don't panic,
I left Mick alone here.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.183
He's itching to punch a hippie.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.794
- That's not good.

19:08.059 --> 19:11.672
- Twilight Sparkle
come to life.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.242
- Dude, we're brony bros.

19:16.285 --> 19:19.680
- Mick, join the herd!
- Outta my way.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.203
- Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

19:21.247 --> 19:24.206
- Well, it's not a dragon,
but it'll have to do.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.470
- Mick, hold on, it's not like
it's hurting anyone.

19:33.389 --> 19:36.827
- We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.569
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.752
- It's beautiful!

19:55.846 --> 19:57.239
- Oh my God!

19:58.501 --> 19:59.546
- What!

20:08.946 --> 20:10.252
- Oh my God!
Is it--

20:10.296 --> 20:12.515
- Yup, yup.
It's eating her heart.

20:12.559 --> 20:13.995
I'm gonna be sick.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.261
- Mick, shoot it.
- Shoot it!

20:22.003 --> 20:25.224
Damn horse is fire-proof.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.538
- I hate glitter.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.068
- Okay, we can fix this

20:44.112 --> 20:45.940
before the Time Bureau
even has to know about it.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.333
Can we?

20:47.376 --> 20:49.422
- Look, Ava still thinks of me
as the woman

20:49.465 --> 20:52.294
who saved the world
last year, and I don't

20:52.338 --> 20:54.905
want her to know that there's a
whole new problem with history.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.168
- Yeah,
that we basically created.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.954
- You go find the unicorn,

20:59.997 --> 21:02.696
and I'll go find Constantine.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.001
- Yup.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.003
Every time.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.311
Somebody can't
read bloody signs.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.922
You don't know that there's
a "do not disturb" sign

21:11.966 --> 21:13.489
on the bloody door?

21:13.533 --> 21:15.230
Sara.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.494
Yeah, uh--I can't talk
right now, love.

21:18.538 --> 21:21.280
I've got a threesome
that's about to pop off

21:21.323 --> 21:23.499
in here with
some contortionists.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.154
- You were right.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.374
- Ah.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.853
What was that now?

21:29.897 --> 21:31.507
- You were right!

21:31.551 --> 21:34.641
There's a magical creature
at Woodstock. Now let's go!

21:34.684 --> 21:37.252
- You know, for someone
with a time traveling machine,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.298
you seem to be
in an awful hurry.

21:39.341 --> 21:42.301
- John, the unicorn has
already gored two hippies.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.914
- Yeah.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.351
- Well, all right, I'm in.
But first, I need to know,

21:49.395 --> 21:53.877
was any of your team
musked by the beast?

21:53.921 --> 21:55.226
- If that's what you're calling

21:55.270 --> 21:58.055
its sparkle-sauce,
then, yeah. Why?

21:58.099 --> 22:03.539
- Oh, they're in
for one hell of a ride.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.329
Man, I wish my dad could see us

22:10.372 --> 22:12.809
now hunting a bloodthirsty
creature through Woodstock.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.159
- What's the beef between
you and your old man anyway?

22:15.203 --> 22:16.596
He hit you?
- No.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.380
- Nope.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.165
- Did he dress up like a clown
and scare the hell out of you?

22:21.209 --> 22:23.080
No.

22:23.124 --> 22:26.040
He was emotionally unavailable
to me when I was growing up.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.172
- Yeah.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.913
To the whole world,
my dad was this great

22:29.957 --> 22:32.916
larger-than-life guy,
but to me,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.527
he was just cold.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.531
- Boo-hoo!

22:45.799 --> 22:47.104
I'm not your dad!

22:51.326 --> 22:55.417
I'm sorry I didn't follow
in your footsteps and enlist.

22:55.461 --> 22:58.333
But for your information, I had
a medal pinned to my chest,

22:58.377 --> 23:00.727
only you don't have
the clearance to see it!

23:05.558 --> 23:07.081

The only reason I ever
want to see Nora Darhk again is

the Time Stone back and

comes at a terrible cost.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.724
And I didn't want to tell you
because I love the idea

37:28.768 --> 37:30.683
of us living together,
and I didn't want to risk that

37:30.726 --> 37:33.729
or you thinking that maybe
I wasn't such a screw-up.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.037
- I know.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.778
- Mm-hmm.

37:38.821 --> 37:41.302
Gary was very proud
about losing a nipple.

37:41.346 --> 37:44.610
- But you cooked dinner...
- Yeah!

37:44.653 --> 37:46.394
Because I love you,
you goober, and

37:46.438 --> 37:48.701
nothing is gonna
change that.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.485
- Even after
I went behind your back

37:50.529 --> 37:52.357
to work with Constantine
to send a unicorn to hell?

37:52.400 --> 37:54.359
- Okay, yeah, I wasn't
so crazy about that part.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.100
Let's not talk
about Constantine.

37:57.144 --> 38:00.060
I'm crazy about you.
Come here.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.323
Stop being neurotic.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.543
I don't think
that you're a screw-up.

38:04.586 --> 38:07.328
I think that you are
a damn fine Captain,

38:07.372 --> 38:10.897
faced with some
extraordinary circumstances.

38:10.940 --> 38:14.030
- God, I love you.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.905
And...

38:18.948 --> 38:21.647
I got a question.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.736
Do we...
- Mm-hmm.

38:23.779 --> 38:24.867
- You and I,

38:24.911 --> 38:27.348
think that maybe right now

38:27.392 --> 38:30.351
is not the best time
for me to move in?

38:30.395 --> 38:32.745
You know that I want to;
nothing would make me happier.

38:32.788 --> 38:36.488
It's just...I feel like
I need to be out there.

38:36.531 --> 38:39.360
With my team.
- I understand.

38:39.404 --> 38:42.145
But can you promise me
that our relationship will

38:42.189 --> 38:43.930
continue to evolve, please?

38:43.973 --> 38:47.412
I want this--
you and me--for real.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.936
- So do I.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.112
We're gonna figure it out.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.403
No.

39:23.578 --> 39:26.451
- I haven't even
asked you anything yet.

39:26.494 --> 39:30.150
- It's not even magic,
love, it's deduction.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.500
You need me
to join the Legends,

39:32.544 --> 39:36.199
despite knowing
that needing me

39:36.243 --> 39:39.115
always causes
somebody trouble.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.429
Something must have happened
in the last five months.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.476
You're more miserable
than usual.

39:51.519 --> 39:54.957
- Look...

39:55.001 --> 39:57.046
You and I are friends.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.005
And I like friends.

39:59.048 --> 40:02.312
Friends are useful,
but roommates...

40:02.356 --> 40:05.490
See, Sara, I would rather
bloody top myself

40:05.533 --> 40:07.709
than move in with you lot.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.806
- See you around, John.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.467
- So long, Sara.

40:30.166 --> 40:33.518

41:11.469 --> 41:13.993
'Cause I'm a nasty
piece of work.

41:26.701 --> 41:30.444
Get your
bloody paws off me!

41:52.553 --> 41:54.381
Oh, bollocks.

42:21.451 --> 42:23.062
- Greg, move your head.
