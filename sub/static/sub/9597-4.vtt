00:12.424 --> 00:14.658
Man: Will you tell?

00:14.692 --> 00:17.646
No. No.

00:19.479 --> 00:20.443
Please.

00:28.113 --> 00:30.013
- Will you tell?!
- No.

00:51.129 --> 00:53.298
- This is all your fault.
- I'm sorry, mr. Stanley.

00:53.366 --> 00:55.600
I never expected so many customers.

00:55.634 --> 00:58.735
Yeah? You and your menu additions
are making my life hell Rizzoli.

00:58.770 --> 01:03.039
Hey, hey, hey, zip it.
And it's Mrs. Rizzoli to you, Stanley.

01:04.074 --> 01:07.178
- That's it.
- You gave me too much.

01:07.212 --> 01:08.547
No, that's ... that's okay.
That's for you.

01:09.549 --> 01:12.717
Thank you. Have a good day.

01:14.154 --> 01:17.051
You're running this morning.
Come on.

01:17.086 --> 01:18.585
Mnh-mnh. You're too late.
I already showered.

01:18.619 --> 01:20.617
Last night or this morning?

01:20.652 --> 01:22.446
Never mind. Let's go.

01:22.481 --> 01:24.805
No, I-I can't. My stomach's full.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.319
Jane, you need endorphins
from physical activity...

01:27.353 --> 01:28.611
because you're depressed.

01:28.646 --> 01:31.099
I'm not depressed.
See?

01:31.167 --> 01:32.499
You'll get over Casey.

01:32.533 --> 01:34.765
Who said it had anything
to do with Casey?

01:34.799 --> 01:37.132
I-I got a new...
ding in my car door.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.993
You lied.
Your left eyebrow moved.

01:39.027 --> 01:42.038
You are in stage four of the
five stages of relationship grief.

01:42.072 --> 01:44.103
I am in stage five of ignoring you.

01:44.137 --> 01:48.199
I can't taste, touch, smell...
see, or hear you.

01:48.231 --> 01:52.095
Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, acceptance.

01:52.129 --> 01:54.359
A good run will get you to acceptance.

01:54.394 --> 01:55.960
Why'd she have to make bunnies?

01:55.995 --> 01:59.322
Mnh-mnh. I like them bunnies.

01:59.356 --> 02:01.421
Taste better when they got a shape.

02:04.122 --> 02:05.353
Mmm.

02:05.387 --> 02:06.452
You know what? Take these, too.

02:06.486 --> 02:08.049
- You sure?
- Yeah.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.145
'Cause I don't want you
losing any more weight.

02:10.176 --> 02:13.043
You know, I like my Detectives
with a little meat on them.

02:14.243 --> 02:17.943
Rizzoli, get over here.
We're too busy for table service.

02:17.977 --> 02:21.342
I was just getting a to-go
container for this gentleman.

02:21.377 --> 02:23.209
You heard that? Gentleman.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.507
Rondo, hurry.

02:30.196 --> 02:32.557
You've been giving free food to Rondo,

02:32.591 --> 02:34.522
and that's why the
sandwiches cost 12 bucks.

02:34.590 --> 02:36.588
I take it out of my
tip money, Detective.

02:36.622 --> 02:39.416
That man's been through a lot.
Leave him alone.

02:42.046 --> 02:44.433
Oh. We got a murder.

02:44.467 --> 02:46.354
You gonna run to the crime scene?

02:48.115 --> 02:50.247
Five minutes. Three.

02:53.962 --> 02:58.591
<i> Read my lips. Get your ass back
in the seat and get this bus in service.</i>

02:58.626 --> 03:02.378
Nobody tells me when to drive.

03:02.413 --> 03:04.903
He's a transit cop. It's not
even his crime scene. It's ours.

03:04.937 --> 03:06.295
I know him ... Artie McMurphy.

03:06.330 --> 03:07.824
He's always irritable.

03:07.858 --> 03:12.273
His wife ran off with her boyfriend years
ago or maybe died, something like that.

03:12.308 --> 03:13.997
- Something like that?
- Yeah, I think they had a kid.

03:14.032 --> 03:17.512
- So you two were close.
- Must have been 10 years ago.

03:17.546 --> 03:19.954
No, had to be 20.
I was still in the drug unit.

03:19.988 --> 03:21.941
Let me know if you need
help finding your car.

03:23.501 --> 03:28.335
Oh. She looks like some...
big weird doll.

03:28.370 --> 03:30.427
<i>Dame de Voyage.</i>

03:30.462 --> 03:32.319
Why are we speaking french?

03:33.353 --> 03:36.400
Sex dolls originated
in the 17th century.

03:36.435 --> 03:38.889
Randy sailors took
them on lonely voyages.

03:38.924 --> 03:41.783
But this might be agalmatophilia.

03:41.813 --> 03:44.039
Anything ending in "philia"
is not gonna be good.

03:44.073 --> 03:47.228
A fetish involving the love
between a man and a doll.

03:47.262 --> 03:49.355
A man, a doll, his love, and what?

03:49.389 --> 03:53.175
A 2x4? A hammer?
Hockey stick?

03:53.459 --> 03:59.406
Definitely a solid high-density object.
In common parlance, something hard.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.333
That's a brilliant deduction.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.927
Her wrists were bound to something.

04:03.991 --> 04:05.821
There was no cast-off or blood spatter.

04:05.856 --> 04:09.809
She wasn't killed here. Nice scrunchie.

04:09.844 --> 04:12.868
Yeah, her clothes are
very early '90s, too.

04:12.902 --> 04:16.918
More formal before sweeping
changes to fashion made grunge chic.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.913
And you're telling me this because why?

04:18.947 --> 04:22.205
- She was transported here from the '90s?
- Uh, no, Detective smarty pants.

04:22.239 --> 04:26.026
Because her clothes are 20 years old,
and they don't fit her.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.154
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Breakfast line was long.

04:28.188 --> 04:30.845
Got to help your mom set
up that online ordering.

04:30.913 --> 04:32.839
All right, as soon as you're done
swallowing the Peter rabbit pancake,

04:32.907 --> 04:36.097
can you go through the suitcase, please?

04:37.795 --> 04:40.219
This is too easy.

04:40.253 --> 04:44.904
It's all here ...
driver's license, bus pass, cash, phone.

04:45.939 --> 04:48.765
Victoria Green. She's 25.

04:48.796 --> 04:50.092
She lived in Brighton.

04:50.126 --> 04:55.278
Okay. Not so easy.
She password-protected her phone.

04:56.346 --> 05:00.794
Hmm, okay. So, she was
probably killed wearing that.

05:00.828 --> 05:02.752
The killer redressed
her in those clothes.

05:02.819 --> 05:04.774
And posed her on a bus bench.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.762
So we're not looking
for just any old killer.

05:08.796 --> 05:12.717
We're looking for
a freak with a doll fetish.

05:27.465 --> 05:30.344

05:31.601 --> 05:34.320
<b>3x04 - Welcome to Dollhouse</b>

05:37.275 --> 05:39.239
Where is Korsak?

05:41.671 --> 05:43.833
Is the owner chasing you?

05:43.867 --> 05:46.162
- I'm just gonna head on back ...
- You're not going anywhere until you tell us

05:46.230 --> 05:48.789
what you're doing with that dog.
How did you rip your pants?

05:48.823 --> 05:52.549
- Oh, man. These are new.
- Yeah, new in 1995.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.672
Stealing somebody's dog is a felony.

05:55.706 --> 05:58.700
I didn't steal her.
I'm just taking care of Barney Miller

05:58.734 --> 06:00.728
- until I can find her a good home.
- Barney Miller?

06:01.693 --> 06:03.921
She was... I rescued her.

06:03.955 --> 06:07.847
She was trapped and crying.
Somebody abandoned her.

06:07.882 --> 06:10.608
I'm not visiting you
when they send you to Walpole.

06:11.607 --> 06:14.565
I will. I will visit you.

06:15.731 --> 06:19.485
There are remnants of a subdural
hematoma just above the right ear.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.982
She was knocked out...
with what?

06:22.017 --> 06:24.542
And don't say "something hard."

06:24.577 --> 06:27.970
It was hard.
But the extent of the damage

06:28.005 --> 06:30.803
makes it impossible to determine
the type of instrument used.

06:30.837 --> 06:32.468
Was she raped?

06:32.502 --> 06:35.861
Doubtful. There's no evidence
of trauma, tearing, or bruising.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.758
Doubtful?
So you found something.

06:37.792 --> 06:40.520
Well, she did have sex
within the last 36 hours.

06:40.554 --> 06:43.352
- Okay, what's with the creepy doll makeup?
- It was applied postmortem.

06:43.420 --> 06:46.756
- See the blood under the makeup?
- Mm-hmm. Maybe a sex game gone wrong?

06:46.790 --> 06:49.651
Well, the killer did exhibit
a certain degree of tenderness.

06:49.686 --> 06:52.915
Oh, yeah, real tender, starting
with tenderizing her head.

06:52.949 --> 06:55.783
Got a suspect ...
Herbert Buckley.

06:55.817 --> 06:57.847
Served two years on an A&B,
released two months ago.

06:57.915 --> 07:01.479
He liked to hire hookers and
make them pretend they were dolls.

07:01.513 --> 07:04.481
And hit them in the head
with a crowbar. Nice.

07:05.515 --> 07:07.351
Can you use Frankie?

07:07.418 --> 07:12.885
I'm just not up for a pervert today.
See you, Maura.

07:13.919 --> 07:15.492
Psst! Hey, Doc.

07:15.526 --> 07:17.676
What? Sergeant Korsak.
Are you all right?

07:17.711 --> 07:19.639
I was, uh,
wondering if, uh ...

07:19.673 --> 07:22.749
If you could give a friend
of mine a little checkup?

07:22.783 --> 07:24.322
Here?

07:24.357 --> 07:27.832
There's no such thing as a
little checkup. I'd have to ...

07:27.866 --> 07:29.768
Oh.

07:30.737 --> 07:31.805
Hello.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.679
<i> Man, this is a downer.</i>

07:36.713 --> 07:38.547
Herbert goes at Marlene all the time.

07:38.582 --> 07:40.516
She never called the cops before.

07:40.550 --> 07:43.052
- Who's Marlene?
- Herbert's old lady.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.522
<i> Yeah, you bet I'm frustrated!</i>

07:45.556 --> 07:47.758
<i>I got mushrooms on my
burger, and I hate them!</i>

07:47.825 --> 07:49.560
That would be Herbert.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.062
<i>And now you got sprouts all
in my ketchup!</i>

07:52.097 --> 07:54.332
I'm going left. You take right.

07:54.366 --> 07:55.916
Boston police, freeze.

07:55.990 --> 07:57.668
No. No, no.
We were just talking.

07:57.702 --> 07:59.570
We were just working through our issues.

07:59.604 --> 08:03.074
Baby, I love you. I would
never hurt you. Tell them.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.576
- Are you hurt?
- No.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.845
We were just working
on our relationship.

08:07.879 --> 08:09.880
I-I wasn't gonna hit her.

08:12.017 --> 08:15.500
Uh... oh, hey, easy, bro.
Don't, uh... cry.

08:15.535 --> 08:20.792
It's Marlene. She hates to be alone.
I can't leave her alone.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.561
Take her, Frankie.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.663
I don't know where
she's been. You take her.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.097
Barney Miller is in excellent health. 

08:37.131 --> 08:39.099
Watch this.

08:42.135 --> 08:45.939
Bring me my keys, Barney Miller.
Bring me my keys.

08:45.973 --> 08:48.141
- Oh. 
- Thank you.

08:48.175 --> 08:52.345
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the lights, Barney Miller.

08:53.815 --> 08:54.782
Oh.

08:56.484 --> 08:59.519
- Good girl. Yeah.
- Look what I found.

08:59.553 --> 09:02.155
Oh, an RFID scanner.
Thanks, Susie.

09:02.189 --> 09:04.191
Well, if Barney Miller is chipped,

09:04.225 --> 09:06.426
this will tell us who she belongs to.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.931
Okay.

09:11.865 --> 09:14.466
She's registered to the
Truce veteran center.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.232
Are you a service dog, Barney?

09:16.266 --> 09:18.230
That's why you know all those tricks.

09:18.264 --> 09:22.132
I guess a wounded warrior
needs you more than I do.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.433
Yeah.

09:23.468 --> 09:29.872
Why don't I take Barney Miller home?
Spare you that.

09:29.907 --> 09:33.142
Would you?
I don't think I can do it.

09:33.176 --> 09:35.276
Goodbye, girl.

09:41.150 --> 09:43.885
Oh, wait.
Uh, Barney Miller.

09:45.787 --> 09:47.421
Elsie?

09:47.456 --> 09:49.323
<i>Good girl.</i>

09:49.390 --> 09:53.792
Look at you.
Maura.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.828
Casey.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.896
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.765
How'd you get your collar off again?

10:01.800 --> 10:05.469
Sergeant Korsak found her not
too far from here. Is she yours?

10:05.504 --> 10:09.274
Uh, she's, um ...
she's one of our service dogs.

10:09.308 --> 10:12.310
As you can see, she's pretty
adept at opening doors.

10:13.979 --> 10:17.115
You have
"cauda equina" syndrome, don't you?

10:19.351 --> 10:24.456
- How did it happen?
- Roadside bomb.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.460
I'm partially paralyzed.

10:28.494 --> 10:33.398
A colleague of mine is heading
up the Boston clinical trials

10:33.433 --> 10:36.101
for a new spinal-regeneration
technique. If ...

10:36.135 --> 10:40.205
I know.
I'm on the waiting list.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.141
You should tell Jane.

10:43.175 --> 10:48.514
No. And you won't, either ...
ever.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.115
You have to promise me that.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.786
I don't know that I can make
that promise. She's my friend.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.122
If you're her friend,
you won't tell her.

10:56.156 --> 11:00.706
Casey, a lot of couples cope
with very serious war injuries.

11:00.769 --> 11:04.331
Yeah, hang out with me here,
meet some of those couples.

11:04.365 --> 11:08.002
See what an injury like mine
does to girlfriends, wives, families.

11:08.036 --> 11:12.473
Jane is suffering.
It's mean not to tell her.

11:12.507 --> 11:14.809
The truth is easier than
what she's imagining.

11:14.843 --> 11:19.513
I came back here to see if I
could get into the clinical trials.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.449
I didn't come back for Jane.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.557
Just finished interrogating Herbert.

11:30.592 --> 11:35.245
That is one very
strange man... and woman.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.925
Herbert was looking pretty good
for it until the landlord said

11:37.960 --> 11:39.393
old herb was yelling at Marlene all night.

11:42.064 --> 11:45.098
Hey. Excuse me.
That's my chair you're sit...

11:45.132 --> 11:46.398
God! What is ...

11:46.433 --> 11:47.933
That is not funny!
Who put that there?

11:48.001 --> 11:51.236
That is Marlene, herb's old lady.

11:51.271 --> 11:54.558
- Ugh! Get it out of my chair.
- Oh, man.

11:54.593 --> 11:56.207
What? What's ...
what's wrong with you?

11:56.241 --> 12:00.111
- Barney Miller's gone.
- Aww! Don't be sad.

12:00.145 --> 12:05.550
Marlene is winking at you.
She might like leashes, too.

12:05.584 --> 12:06.584
Show some respect.

12:06.619 --> 12:08.186
- To a mannequin?
- To Elsie.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.922
- That's Barney Miller's real name.
- You knew that dog for two hours.

12:10.956 --> 12:14.526
She works with vets
struggling with PTSD at...

12:14.560 --> 12:16.461
At?

12:16.496 --> 12:21.133
At, uh, the program where
Lieutenant Colonel Jones works.

12:21.168 --> 12:25.938
Really? Yeah, well, that's ...
that's interesting.

12:25.973 --> 12:28.074
Herb is downstairs crying like a baby.

12:28.108 --> 12:30.309
He's wrapped himself
around the security station.

12:30.344 --> 12:33.479
He won't leave without...
Marlene.

12:33.547 --> 12:36.549
Don't let the size-2 jeans fool you.
That bitch is heavy.

12:36.583 --> 12:41.588
Wow! Marlene's no cheap
date, either. 8 grand?

12:41.622 --> 12:43.356
Damn!

12:43.391 --> 12:46.259
Of course, if you amortize, that
might be cheaper than a wife.

12:46.293 --> 12:48.761
Plus, you get a woman who doesn't talk.

12:49.648 --> 12:51.781
Oh, great.
Thank you, Moe, Curly, Larry.

12:51.865 --> 12:53.165
Excuse me, Curly, could you
take Marlene out of here, please?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.967
- Certainly.
- And you, Larry,

12:55.002 --> 12:56.903
did you unlock the password
on victim's smartphone yet?

12:56.937 --> 12:58.671
Can't crack the password,
but I'll keep trying.

12:58.706 --> 13:00.673
What about you, Moe?

13:00.708 --> 13:03.776
Monthly bus pass won't tell us anything.
B-cat doesn't track usage.

13:03.811 --> 13:07.847
16 bytes per sector are reserved
for keys and access conditions

13:07.882 --> 13:09.916
and cannot normally
be used for user data.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.852
Beep. I am a robot.

13:11.886 --> 13:14.656
Beep. I do not...
compute human talk.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.795
I do not use that inflection.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.800
And that is the storage
space on a B-cat card.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.069
- That's riveting.
- I'm going to the gym.

13:22.103 --> 13:24.138
And even though you're rude,
you're coming with me.

13:24.572 --> 13:28.349
No. Thank you.
I'm too tired to work out.

13:28.384 --> 13:29.649
Then let's go to the Dirty Robber.

13:29.805 --> 13:32.313
- I'll even have a beer with you.
- No, I'm gonna go work out on my couch.

13:32.347 --> 13:34.750
Five stages of junk food.

13:35.818 --> 13:38.086
Hey. Hey.

13:39.721 --> 13:45.092
Uh, uh, I mentioned Casey.
You think that's what's got her down?

13:45.127 --> 13:47.895
I'd only be guessing.

13:48.129 --> 13:53.402
Hey, come see what Detective
Frost set up for me.

13:53.437 --> 13:57.306
Now all my customers can order online.

13:57.341 --> 14:00.709
Oh, wow. This is great.

14:01.744 --> 14:06.048
I'm worried about Jane.
It's as bad as when

14:06.082 --> 14:09.985
Andrew Spagnola broke her
heart at the shining star prom.

14:21.431 --> 14:24.867
You have to swear that you
will never mention to Jane

14:24.901 --> 14:26.401
what I'm about to tell you.

14:30.140 --> 14:33.008
That's, uh, "Gray's Anatomy."

14:33.043 --> 14:35.478
Swear, Angela.

14:38.014 --> 14:41.050
I swear my lips are sealed.

14:42.753 --> 14:46.089
- I went to see Casey.
- Oh.

14:46.123 --> 14:49.092
- Okay. I can't tell you.
- No.

14:49.126 --> 14:52.161
I promise. Talk.

14:55.363 --> 14:57.465
He's partially paralyzed.

14:59.502 --> 15:01.170
He doesn't want Jane to know.

15:01.704 --> 15:07.142
Partially paralyzed?
Does that mean he can't have children?

15:07.176 --> 15:08.944
- Angela.
- What?

15:08.978 --> 15:12.047
I want a grandkid, and Jane is ...
is crazy for him.

15:12.481 --> 15:15.884
There is a small chance that
he may regain function someday,

15:15.919 --> 15:20.055
but he's ... he's pretty resolute.
He doesn't want to see her.

15:20.089 --> 15:24.359
Well, then he's a fool.
I could tell she really liked him.

15:24.394 --> 15:27.896
I think she loves him.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.459
Man, you still haven't cracked
the password on her phone? 

15:40.493 --> 15:42.708
Thanks.
Give it up.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.594
Hey, maybe the D.O.J.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.934
- will let you borrow that kid that
hacked into the pentagon. - I'll get it.

15:47.969 --> 15:50.604
While you were playing with that
cellphone, I did some actual work.

15:50.638 --> 15:53.708
I went to Victoria's apartment.
Locked up tight, nothing disturbed.

15:53.842 --> 15:55.443
She moved here from
Atlanta to take a job

15:55.477 --> 15:58.446
at an accounting firm ...
Ron Montgomery Associates.

15:58.481 --> 16:00.149
Is her office anywhere near
where we found her body?

16:00.183 --> 16:02.985
No.
Castlegate Towers in Jamaica plain.

16:03.053 --> 16:05.621
- And we don't know where
she was last seen?  - Nope.

16:05.655 --> 16:07.789
She had a bus pass. You look
at the bus drivers on the route

16:07.824 --> 16:14.396
- between her office and her apartment?
- No! Gee! Didn't think of that.

16:14.430 --> 16:17.466
Yes, I checked the route she
might have taken and all 73 others.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.401
Drivers working that day
and night checked out.

16:19.435 --> 16:23.771
Oh, yeah! Yes!
I am good. I'm finally in.

16:27.576 --> 16:30.132
I think I know why our victim
was deleting all her texts.

16:30.241 --> 16:32.614
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah, she was a sexter.

16:32.648 --> 16:36.084
And she was sexting
with someone named "R."

16:36.119 --> 16:38.453
Oh, my.
"R" wasn't shy, was he?

16:38.487 --> 16:41.122
Must be running for congress.

16:41.156 --> 16:43.991
"R" for Ron?
Ron Montgomery Associates?

16:44.026 --> 16:49.797
"Ron Montgomery runs a family
company with family-friendly values."

16:49.831 --> 16:52.933
I remember when that meant
you weren't a pervert.

16:52.968 --> 16:57.672
<i>She was new, but
she was a good employee.</i>

16:57.706 --> 16:59.507
<i>You send your picture to
all your good employees?</i>

16:59.541 --> 17:02.577
<i> Oh, that.</i>

17:02.612 --> 17:05.707
Uh, uh, no, we were ... we were
just having some innocent fun.

17:05.798 --> 17:08.582
Yeah, looks real innocent.

17:08.617 --> 17:12.686
Oh. No. I didn't do that.

17:12.834 --> 17:15.636
I-I-I could never do
something like that.

17:15.671 --> 17:17.037
But you did have sex
with her, didn't you?

17:17.071 --> 17:19.740
No. No, we didn't.
I'm married.

17:19.773 --> 17:23.577
And we have evidence that Victoria
had sex with someone the day she died.

17:23.612 --> 17:26.079
- You have evidence?
- Yeah, a little semen.

17:26.114 --> 17:27.949
Which is full of DNA,
so why don't we just

17:27.983 --> 17:31.050
do a cheek swab and make
sure it's not your DNA.

17:31.621 --> 17:35.056
Okay.
No, we had sex. We had sex.

17:35.091 --> 17:39.060
It was consensual and
it was on her lunch hour.

17:39.094 --> 17:41.062
'Cause you can't have her
fooling around on company time.

17:41.096 --> 17:44.365
She was lonely.
It wasn't serious.

17:44.399 --> 17:47.634
<i>It is now.
When did you leave work?</i>

17:47.669 --> 17:49.903
<i>Um... I left before she did.</i>

17:49.937 --> 17:51.905
<i>You ...
you can check with security.</i>

17:51.940 --> 17:53.640
<i>I used my key card
in the parking garage.</i>

17:53.675 --> 17:56.542
<i>- Where did you go after that?
- Straight home.</i>

17:56.577 --> 18:02.580
We've got another one.
Probably happened last night.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.050
Get Frankie. Check those
security tapes in his building.

18:07.085 --> 18:09.886
Make sure his story checks out.

18:09.921 --> 18:12.622
More '90s clothing.

18:12.657 --> 18:15.085
It takes a lot of rage to
do that to somebody's head.

18:15.218 --> 18:18.595
Blunt-force trauma.
Remarkable.

18:18.629 --> 18:20.663
It is the same.

18:20.698 --> 18:22.966
- What? Same weapon?
- Same scrunchie.

18:24.735 --> 18:27.069
So our victims were either
transported from the '90s

18:27.103 --> 18:32.941
or they work for Hillary Clinton
or our killer was a scrunchie freak.

18:32.975 --> 18:36.645
All her I.D., bus pass.
Diane Campbell.

18:36.679 --> 18:37.813
She lived downtown on Tremont Street.

18:37.847 --> 18:40.683
Well, that's nowhere near where
our first victim lived or worked.

18:40.751 --> 18:42.918
Nowhere near here, either.

18:46.741 --> 18:49.376
Yeah, no wonder they're scared.

18:49.410 --> 18:52.212
Somebody's hunting young women.

18:53.914 --> 18:55.582
<i> Hey, can I get my bagel toasted?</i>

18:55.616 --> 18:59.485
I rue the day I gave you
a job, Rizzoli ... rue it. You hear me?

18:59.520 --> 19:03.522
- Uh, you ordered some coffee?
- Yeah.

19:06.226 --> 19:10.196
No one is using my online menu.
I'm gonna lose my job.

19:10.230 --> 19:12.932
The traffic isn't getting
on to the interweb roads.

19:12.966 --> 19:15.601
- How do I do that?
- Okay, uh, don't panic.

19:15.636 --> 19:18.872
People are attracted to sites
that have a gimmick or content.

19:18.906 --> 19:23.510
You mean like a raffle for a
steak dinner or a Bahamas getaway?

19:23.544 --> 19:25.312
You'll be on permanent getaway

19:25.346 --> 19:27.614
If you don't stop yakking
with the customers.

19:29.449 --> 19:30.817
I was thinking something more
along the lines of a blog.

19:30.851 --> 19:32.952
Something people see every day.

19:32.987 --> 19:35.455
You think I'm gonna see
my food sometime this year?

19:35.489 --> 19:36.956
Yes, of course, sir.

19:36.991 --> 19:40.460
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey.

19:40.494 --> 19:42.362
I thought you said things
were gonna go faster in here.

19:42.396 --> 19:44.295
We were just working out a
few glitches.

19:44.389 --> 19:46.499
Mm-hmm. Right.
So, did our sexter's story check out?

19:46.534 --> 19:49.302
- And what was on the security tapes?
- Frankie's still looking.

19:49.336 --> 19:51.871
Frost, doesn't it feel like
we're missing something?

19:52.873 --> 19:55.575
Time of death for both
victims was around midnight.

19:55.609 --> 19:58.311
The cause of death  sure looks the same.

19:58.345 --> 20:01.214
We got the doll pose, the makeup,

20:01.248 --> 20:04.350
- the '90s clothing, suitcases.
- But they had nothing in common.

20:04.385 --> 20:06.252
I mean, the only link is
the monthly bus passes,

20:06.287 --> 20:08.888
but they didn't take the same buses,
and all the drivers were clean.

20:08.923 --> 20:11.424
Wait a minute.
What about the passengers?

20:12.393 --> 20:14.594
What if the killer is riding the bus

20:14.628 --> 20:17.230
and randomly targeting
young working women?

20:17.264 --> 20:18.899
Thanks, Ma.

20:24.439 --> 20:27.541
Yep, that's Ronnie
the sexter, all right,

20:27.576 --> 20:29.743
driving out of his
business's garage at 7:58.

20:29.778 --> 20:32.279
- Nice work, Frankie.
-  What's so nice about it?

20:32.347 --> 20:34.281
It just confirms the guy's story.

20:34.315 --> 20:36.216
Frankie's good at this.
He's got more. Wait for it.

20:37.418 --> 20:38.918
And we're waiting for what?

20:38.953 --> 20:40.887
A 21-gun salute because you
did a little Detective work?

20:40.922 --> 20:42.456
I'm doing a lot of detecting work

20:42.490 --> 20:44.357
for someone who doesn't
have his gold badge.

20:44.392 --> 20:46.894
Hmm, I think I detect some whining.

20:46.928 --> 20:48.695
This is from a security camera

20:48.730 --> 20:51.465
across the street from
Montgomery's office building.

20:51.532 --> 20:53.934
Wow. So, we get to watch him
drive out from a different angle.

20:53.968 --> 20:55.402
You know what I love about you?

20:55.436 --> 20:56.803
You're always so
up-beat and supportive.

20:56.871 --> 20:58.405
You see that?

20:58.439 --> 21:00.340
Ron Montgomery pulls up
in front just as Victoria,

21:00.374 --> 21:02.208
victim number one, leaves the building.

21:02.243 --> 21:05.612
Yeah, then they argue...
right here.

21:05.646 --> 21:08.515
Hmm. He's got some game.
Looks like she's giving in.

21:08.549 --> 21:11.518
And getting in his car.

21:11.552 --> 21:15.756
So Ron Montgomery's not only
a cheater. He's also a liar.

21:15.790 --> 21:18.291
Look, when I heard
that Victoria was dead,

21:18.326 --> 21:21.495
I-I didn't want to be involved.

21:21.563 --> 21:24.298
Oh, okay. No worries.
You're not involved.

21:24.332 --> 21:27.501
You were the last one seen with a woman
who was found with her skull bashed in.

21:27.535 --> 21:28.802
We're so sorry to bother you.

21:30.305 --> 21:33.507
How about her?
Were you not involved with her, either?

21:33.541 --> 21:36.644
What are you doing? I-I don't even
know who that is. I didn't do that.

21:36.678 --> 21:38.946
Why were you fighting with
Victoria the night she was murdered?

21:40.448 --> 21:43.278
She found out that I'm
not really separated.

21:43.378 --> 21:48.256
And I was giving her a ride home,
trying to explain, but she was so upset.

21:48.291 --> 21:51.426
She made me pull over near Allendale
circle and she got out of the car,

21:51.460 --> 21:53.561
and that's the last time that I saw her.

21:53.596 --> 21:55.565
That's miles from where Victoria lived.

21:55.599 --> 21:58.703
- And then where'd you go?
- The Blue Tassel.

21:58.738 --> 22:01.974
Uh, I was there...
I was there till closing.

22:02.008 --> 22:03.842
Ask the bartender, Ned.

22:05.511 --> 22:10.416
Make yourself comfortable.
We'll be back.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.867
There she goes. 

22:16.901 --> 22:20.103
Not sure how far, though.
Look at those heels.

22:20.138 --> 22:23.073
Bartender confirms Ronnie boy was
there till 2:00 in the morning.

22:23.107 --> 22:24.274
Hey, wait. Look.

22:25.610 --> 22:29.245
- She took a bus.
- I think our bus theory is back.

22:31.048 --> 22:32.716
I checked the backgrounds
on all the bus drivers,

22:32.750 --> 22:35.719
but I think I'll go have a
face-to-face with that one.

22:35.953 --> 22:39.389
- You remember her?
- She's the girl on the news.

22:39.423 --> 22:40.724
Always got on at Forest Hills,
but the other night,

22:40.758 --> 22:42.826
I picked her up on Allendale.

22:42.860 --> 22:44.628
- Where were you two nights ago?
- Got pulled off my route at 10:00

22:44.662 --> 22:46.863
to fill in on the 117 bus in East Boston.

22:46.898 --> 22:49.399
Worked until 1:00 in the morning.
You can check.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.669
- Thank you.
- Hello, Vanilla.

22:53.071 --> 22:57.875
- Angela's guardians?
- Mrs. Vanilla takes good care of us,

22:57.910 --> 23:00.979
- so when she put out the call ...
- Uh, call? What call?

23:01.013 --> 23:04.049
To protect the young women of the
city, make the buses safe again.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.651
Why is my mother in the
middle of everything?

23:06.686 --> 23:10.022
Maura's found something big.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.357
Just be safe.

23:14.361 --> 23:17.830
This was embedded in the parietal
lobe of Diane Campbell's brain.

23:18.865 --> 23:22.368
- A piece of a toothpick?
- Big splinter.

23:22.403 --> 23:24.504
I am prepared to say
it is a sliver of wood.

23:25.506 --> 23:29.442
Yeah, Korsak, how could you possibly
think that a sliver was a splinter?

23:29.477 --> 23:34.481
See this? This stain is actually
from two blood types ... AB-positive,

23:34.515 --> 23:38.452
which matches victim number one,
Victoria Green, and 0-negative,

23:38.486 --> 23:40.787
which is a match with victim
number two, Diane Campbell.

23:41.322 --> 23:45.893
- So the splinter ...
- Precise terminology.

23:45.927 --> 23:49.430
Is the sliver from the murder weapon?

23:49.465 --> 23:52.433
Oh, doesn't that look like
her "I've got a secret" face.

23:52.468 --> 23:53.902
I found a third blood type.

23:55.171 --> 23:57.974
You want us to believe there are
three types of blood on that sliver?

23:58.008 --> 24:00.810
Well, it is a big sliver.
And one other thing.

24:00.844 --> 24:03.980
The third blood sample is 20 years old.

24:04.048 --> 24:06.888
- Have you been drinking?
- Yes. Water.

24:07.017 --> 24:08.785
Two liters a day, as
recommended by the Mayo clinic.

24:08.819 --> 24:11.387
You couldn't possibly tell
how old that speck of blood is.

24:11.422 --> 24:12.889
Yes, I can. It's simple.

24:12.923 --> 24:15.692
A laser excites the
tryptophan until it fluoresces.

24:15.726 --> 24:17.460
- Tick-tock.
- Well, you asked.

24:17.495 --> 24:19.829
Jane, that sliver could be
a piece of the murder weapon.

24:19.864 --> 24:22.785
That our killer used on
someone else 20 years ago.

24:22.885 --> 24:25.033
You got enough for a DNA profile?

24:25.117 --> 24:27.351
- I have the results from the trace section.
- Oh, thank you.

24:27.919 --> 24:30.676
The sliver is white ash.

24:30.710 --> 24:34.828
So... we could be looking
for a club made of white ash?

24:34.862 --> 24:37.789
Our old nightsticks were white ash.

24:42.149 --> 24:43.944
You think we're looking for a cop?

24:47.062 --> 24:48.556
Who else is a young
woman gonna trust, right?

24:48.591 --> 24:50.719
Someone in a uniform.

24:51.754 --> 24:54.481
These were phased out, but I kept mine.

24:54.515 --> 24:55.843
So did a lot of guys.

24:55.877 --> 24:57.939
We'd be looking at an
old-timer, maybe retired,

24:57.973 --> 24:59.701
someone with a history of violence.

24:59.735 --> 25:01.730
No, we didn't find
anything in cold cases,

25:01.765 --> 25:03.660
and there were no murders
with a similar M.O. in NCIC

25:03.694 --> 25:05.225
for the past 20 years.

25:05.259 --> 25:07.519
I'll check on any cop who went
to prison for assaults on women

25:07.553 --> 25:09.451
or any domestic violence.

25:09.486 --> 25:11.448
Right. And maybe our killer's
been released. He's back at it.

25:11.482 --> 25:13.575
When I first come on the job,

25:13.609 --> 25:16.004
had to just about kill your wife
to get charged with anything.

25:16.039 --> 25:19.132
How many guys we tell to take
a walk around the block to cool off?

25:19.166 --> 25:21.625
- Had to see them punch the old lady.
- The old lady?

25:21.660 --> 25:23.822
Sorry. It was 30 years ago.
I am sorry.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.814
I had this little trick where I used to
piss off the old man so he'd come at me.

25:27.849 --> 25:30.011
Gave me a chance to discipline him.

25:30.046 --> 25:32.505
Hmm, you provoke the wife-beaters
into picking on someone their own size.

25:32.540 --> 25:34.701
Ah, well, sometimes they were bigger.

25:42.953 --> 25:45.479
I've been thinking about what
you said about him being tender.

25:45.547 --> 25:47.608
- Casey?
- Yeah, Casey.

25:47.643 --> 25:50.903
No, Maura, the killer.
And stop saying that name.

25:50.937 --> 25:53.764
Exposure therapy might
help you get over... Casey.

25:53.798 --> 25:56.591
- Casey. Casey.
- Stop it!

25:56.625 --> 25:58.022
I'm just trying to help.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.119
If you want to play
shrink, help me come up

26:00.153 --> 26:01.512
with a psychological profile of this killer.

26:01.585 --> 26:03.910
He's dissociated from reality.
He's constructed a world

26:03.945 --> 26:06.371
in which an act of extreme violence...

26:06.405 --> 26:09.498
...violently smashing women's
heads in with a nightstick.

26:09.532 --> 26:11.895
...is followed by a
tender expression of love.

26:11.929 --> 26:15.720
Yeah, tenderly slapping
on pancake makeup

26:15.754 --> 26:17.750
and making them wear ugly-ass clothes.

26:17.818 --> 26:19.713
Come on.
I just got my heart rate up.

26:19.747 --> 26:22.707
He dresses his victims
up in 20-year-old clothes.

26:22.741 --> 26:24.870
Maura, you found 20-year-old blood.

26:24.904 --> 26:26.732
That feels rather significant.

26:26.767 --> 26:28.996
You think we ran
long enough to need a shower?

26:29.030 --> 26:32.354
Oh, gosh darn it. I didn't get
an endorphin hit yet.

26:32.388 --> 26:34.020
That was a short run.

26:34.054 --> 26:36.614
I'm a fast runner.
I thought of something.

26:36.648 --> 26:38.309
What do we have on the cop theory.

26:38.344 --> 26:39.841
We looked at all cops
fired for domestic violence

26:39.876 --> 26:41.837
over the last 20 years
... nothing that fits.

26:41.872 --> 26:43.433
Only found a few ex-cops doing time,

26:43.468 --> 26:45.796
and none of them were
released within the last year.

26:45.831 --> 26:49.889
Okay, I think our killer is re-enacting
a murder he committed 20 years ago.

26:50.224 --> 26:52.482
Put on WZJT.

26:54.445 --> 26:57.973
<i>Our young ladies are being
stalked by a deranged killer.</i>

26:58.007 --> 27:00.300
<i>It is up to me and my homis</i>

27:00.334 --> 27:01.565
<i>to help the Boston police department.</i>

27:01.599 --> 27:02.930
<i> The police don't care...</i>

27:02.964 --> 27:05.257
Thank goodness the
homies are on the case.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.353
Rizzoli, why the hell is your informant

27:07.387 --> 27:09.549
the lead choirboy for
your mother's homies?

27:09.583 --> 27:11.311
<i>Hold on. That is not fair.</i>

27:11.346 --> 27:13.841
<i>The police do care. They
just can't be everywhere.</i>

27:13.875 --> 27:16.835
<i>So Angela's guardians
are gonna be there.</i>

27:16.869 --> 27:20.927
Well, it's gonna be Angela's ashes
when I'm through. Look at this.

27:20.961 --> 27:23.220
Your mom is blogging about our case.

27:23.255 --> 27:25.950
- Uh-oh.
- Double uh-oh.

27:25.985 --> 27:29.542
Damn. 12,104 followers.

27:32.571 --> 27:33.768
Yeah, you better hide.

27:50.303 --> 27:52.798
You think he's gonna fire her?

27:52.833 --> 27:56.723
Oh, I don't know.
She really did it this time.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.886
<i>Well, we got a situation.</i>

27:58.921 --> 28:01.547
Ugh. "Angela's guardians
are gonna be there."

28:01.614 --> 28:04.507
Yeah, and I'm gonna be
back in evidence management.

28:04.542 --> 28:08.132
- Ooh. I don't think so.
- How did she do that?

28:08.167 --> 28:10.829
One study found that
when sniffing pumpkin pie

28:10.863 --> 28:14.368
and lavender, men become
sexually aroused.

28:14.436 --> 28:17.999
- Maura!
- Not one word, Rizzoli.

28:25.730 --> 28:29.031
Hey, Ma. Chatting with one
of your virtual friends? 

28:29.066 --> 28:31.068
Did you see my blog?

28:31.202 --> 28:35.402
I'm putting up a few more safety tips.
I have 12 followers so far.

28:35.436 --> 28:39.171
- You have 12,000, Ma.
- I do?

28:39.205 --> 28:42.374
Uh, 12,313.

28:42.409 --> 28:44.365
12,314.

28:44.564 --> 28:47.713
Okay. Time to say goodbye to
your 12,000 little friends.

28:49.349 --> 28:53.152
We have to help her.
She's so angry.

28:53.220 --> 28:54.787
I have a very good idea.

28:54.822 --> 28:58.124
Uh, no, no. Whatever it is
you're thinking of doing, don't.

28:58.158 --> 29:00.860
It is none of our business.

29:07.634 --> 29:12.171
Shut my mother's blog down
now.

29:12.239 --> 29:16.076
You sure? I never built a blog
that had this kind of traffic.

29:16.110 --> 29:17.678
Do it or you'll be directing traffic.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.513
All right, everything is
significant to a serial killer.

29:19.547 --> 29:20.747
He is not randomly targeting

29:20.782 --> 29:24.484
and randomly dropping his
victims at those bus stops.

29:24.619 --> 29:26.286
Yeah, but we checked everything.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.654
If there was a body dropped
at any of those bus stops

29:27.688 --> 29:28.755
in the last 20 years,
we'd know about it.

29:30.758 --> 29:32.759
Korsak, we checked for body
drops near Egleston Square.

29:32.794 --> 29:35.596
- Yeah.
- But we didn't check incident reports.

29:35.630 --> 29:37.632
You got something?

29:37.866 --> 29:39.333
Maybe ... 20 years ago,
a woman disappeared

29:39.367 --> 29:42.269
from a store near Egleston Square.

29:42.303 --> 29:45.973
<i>Libby McMurphy was reported
missing from her store, "Libby's doll</i>

29:46.273 --> 29:49.943
<i>house and tea room", on August 22,
1992, by her mother, Marion Tibbets.</i>

29:49.978 --> 29:51.545
Libby McMurphy.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.823
<i>Libby, I can forgive anything.</i>

30:01.857 --> 30:05.493
<i>Please come home for me...
for Jonathan.</i>

30:05.527 --> 30:07.161
Whatever you've done...

30:07.196 --> 30:08.830
That's a hell of a memory
you got there, Korsak.

30:08.864 --> 30:10.298
Isn't that your friend,
Artie, the transit cop?

30:10.332 --> 30:12.466
Yeah, Artie McMurphy.
His wife was named Libby.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.597
Well, son was 5 when she disappeared.
He'd be 25 now.

30:15.631 --> 30:17.131
Frost, can you run the kid,
Jonathan McMurphy?

30:17.265 --> 30:20.266
Already running him.
Uh, no criminal, no DMV.

30:20.301 --> 30:22.435
Oh, wait. Here's something.

30:22.470 --> 30:24.337
Tewksbury State Hospital.

30:24.372 --> 30:26.072
Mental hospital. Poor kid.

30:26.106 --> 30:28.040
- Come home.
- He's been there eight years.

30:29.408 --> 30:34.011
Maybe what happened to our two
victims also happened to his mother.

30:34.979 --> 30:39.313
We'd like to talk to
you about your daughter.

30:39.348 --> 30:42.479
Why weren't you interested in
what I had to say 20 years ago?

30:43.981 --> 30:45.648
I see you brought some photos.

30:50.186 --> 30:52.687
Is that Libby and Jonathan?

30:52.722 --> 30:55.290
Yes, that's Libby and
Jonathan at her store,

30:55.324 --> 30:58.326
"Libby's doll house and tea room."

30:58.360 --> 31:00.594
Jonathan loved it there.

31:00.629 --> 31:02.129
Is that ...
what do you call them?

31:02.163 --> 31:06.165
A scrunchie, yeah.
Libby gave them out as party favors.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.201
Those were... happy days.

31:09.236 --> 31:13.105
- Mrs. Tibbets, we've asked you here ...
- My Libby didn't run off.

31:13.139 --> 31:16.575
Not that I'd blame her,
the way Artie treated her.

31:17.510 --> 31:19.077
Artie was abusive?

31:19.111 --> 31:24.749
He was nice as pie at first.
But then after they were married,

31:24.784 --> 31:29.988
she started wearing long-sleeve
shirts to the shop to hide the bruises.

31:30.023 --> 31:34.493
Made excuses for how clumsy she was.

31:34.528 --> 31:39.198
My daughter never would have left
Jonathan behind with that monster.

31:39.233 --> 31:43.470
I kept the shop going
until he took Jonathan,

31:43.504 --> 31:48.508
and he locked him up
in that horrible place.

31:48.543 --> 31:50.077
Oh.

31:56.883 --> 32:01.626
These are love letters
my daughter sent to Artie.

32:01.661 --> 32:06.610
I saved them.
Libby kissed the envelopes.

32:07.748 --> 32:10.817
I thought you might want her DNA.

32:14.689 --> 32:20.394
- I watch a lot of crime shows.
- Thank you, Mrs. Tibbets.

32:20.728 --> 32:24.598
12 excessive-force complaints
all involving you using a nightstick.

32:24.666 --> 32:27.435
Liked to use it at
home, too, didn't you?

32:27.769 --> 32:33.575
You're pissing in the wind, Korsak.
You got no weapon, no motive, no DNA.

32:33.609 --> 32:35.845
We've got a bloody
piece of white-ash wood

32:35.879 --> 32:38.215
that I'll bet came from your nightstick.

32:38.349 --> 32:40.184
You're a betting man, right, Artie?

32:40.218 --> 32:42.453
Would you like to also bet that
blood came from your missing wife?

32:42.487 --> 32:44.254
Well, if you got that on me,

32:44.289 --> 32:47.391
I'd be in cuffs instead of
listening to your bullshit.

32:49.227 --> 32:51.395
You gonna arrest me?

32:52.965 --> 32:56.401
That's what I thought.

33:04.244 --> 33:06.612
Don't hover.
DNA processing takes time.

33:06.647 --> 33:10.482
Well, we don't have time.
Faster, Maura. I need something.

33:11.518 --> 33:13.252
You're breathing on me.

33:15.422 --> 33:16.822
I don't believe this.

33:16.856 --> 33:19.758
If that is a text from a vacation
club in Acapulco, don't respond.

33:19.792 --> 33:24.897
- It might be a scam.
- Does this look like a scam?

33:24.931 --> 33:26.933
It's from Casey.

33:28.769 --> 33:32.004
He says he wants to meet for
drinks tonight at the Dirty Robber.

33:32.039 --> 33:34.240
The comparison test results
for the two victims' lipsticks

33:34.274 --> 33:37.476
- and the lipstick on that envelope.
- Thank you.

33:37.511 --> 33:38.944
Jane, I might have something.

33:40.447 --> 33:45.785
Libby McMurphy used the same brand
of lipstick as our two victims.

33:45.819 --> 33:48.922
I think we just tied
Artie to all three murders.

33:48.956 --> 33:50.622
Come on. I need you.

33:50.657 --> 33:53.291
I think I know who that
20-year-old blood belongs to.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.327
Nothing?

33:57.361 --> 33:59.830
Did you find Artie McMurphy?

33:59.864 --> 34:02.500
No, his Sergeant said he called in sick.
No sign of his car or him.

34:03.835 --> 34:04.702
Barney Miller could
have found something.

34:04.736 --> 34:10.206
Yeah, Frost?
Okay, thanks. 

34:10.341 --> 34:12.577
Another young woman got on a bus
today. She didn't make it home.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.315
God. What can we do?

34:14.349 --> 34:17.253
Artie's been a cop for a long time.
He knows we're looking for him.

34:17.288 --> 34:21.324
- He needs a safe place for his kill.
- Yeah, but we've torn this house apart.

34:21.358 --> 34:26.329
Wait a minute. He left his
last victim in Egleston Square.

34:26.362 --> 34:28.597
His wife's shop was in egleston square.

34:28.632 --> 34:31.502
A lot of those old storefronts
have been vacant for a long time.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.804
What better place to make
your own doll, right? Come on.

34:44.071 --> 34:45.804
<i>Will you tell?!</i> 

34:45.839 --> 34:47.072
<i> No, I said I won't.</i>

34:47.107 --> 34:48.808
<i>- I'll kill you.
- Please don't!</i>

34:48.842 --> 34:51.078
<i>- I swear I will.
- Please don't!</i>

34:51.112 --> 34:52.346
Will you tell?

34:52.380 --> 34:53.480
 It's not Artie. It's Jonathan.

34:53.514 --> 34:54.547
I won't.

34:54.581 --> 34:55.815
Jonathan.

34:56.668 --> 34:58.836
- Jonathan.
- Put the gun down, Artie.

34:59.738 --> 35:00.971
Jonathan, let her go.

35:01.006 --> 35:04.341
Doctors should have listened to me.
Giving him day passes,

35:04.375 --> 35:06.143
trying to integrate
him back into society.

35:06.177 --> 35:09.146
That bus pass they gave
him got two girls killed!

35:10.047 --> 35:11.080
He's a monster.

35:12.049 --> 35:15.085
Mommy, tell!
You have to tell!

35:16.120 --> 35:17.354
No! God!

35:17.489 --> 35:19.923
I had to stop him.
I had to do it.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.625
Send E.M.S. in here now!

35:21.659 --> 35:23.126
Hey, Jonathan,
just stay with me, okay?

35:23.160 --> 35:24.894
What did ... what did
he do to your mom?

35:24.929 --> 35:26.429
He hurt her.

35:27.732 --> 35:31.902
- Where's your mom now?
- He said she went on the bus.

35:31.936 --> 35:33.937
Is ... is that why you've
been riding the bus?

35:33.971 --> 35:39.476
I just wanted to find her.
And then I did.

35:39.510 --> 35:42.746
Why didn't she tell?

35:42.780 --> 35:45.816
I just wanted her to
tell what he did to her.

35:45.850 --> 35:47.850
It's over. Jonathan, it's ...
I'll tell.

35:49.953 --> 35:51.888
I'll tell.

36:09.940 --> 36:14.744
Korsak.
The fireplace.

36:14.778 --> 36:16.078
Cadaver dog didn't find anything.

36:18.314 --> 36:22.318
You knew we were coming
to search your house.

36:23.853 --> 36:27.623
Come on, Artie, we're
taking you home. Move.

36:27.657 --> 36:33.062
- He started a fire.
- To throw off the dog.

36:33.097 --> 36:35.898
- Do it.
- You can't do that.

36:57.184 --> 36:59.785
You killed his mother in front of him.

37:01.387 --> 37:04.155
You turned your son into a monster.

37:31.050 --> 37:33.785
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:35.721 --> 37:40.692
I, uh... I'm really glad
you wanted to meet me.

37:40.727 --> 37:43.162
Me too.

37:46.199 --> 37:47.633
- So...
- So...

37:49.102 --> 37:53.371
- You want to get a drink?
- Yes. Yes.

37:53.405 --> 37:56.106
And...

37:56.140 --> 38:00.778
I just ... I just want to...
start over.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.647
Me too.

38:03.682 --> 38:08.387
- Start... slow.
- Okay.

38:08.421 --> 38:13.792
You know, like, maybe we'd meet
once a week for a run, you know?

38:16.195 --> 38:17.896
- A run?
- Yeah.

38:17.930 --> 38:19.897
Hell, I'll even take
up rollerblading again.

38:24.102 --> 38:28.938
- Payback is a bitch.
- What?

38:28.973 --> 38:32.175
You were humiliated when I said
I didn't want to see you. I get it.

38:32.209 --> 38:35.878
Is it making you feel better to
make me come here and torture me?

38:35.912 --> 38:39.382
- You want to ski, too?
- What are you talking about?

38:43.153 --> 38:46.222
I knew I was a fool when I
got your note. I was so happy.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.424
Wait. What note?
I didn't write you a note.

38:47.458 --> 38:50.093
Yeah?

38:55.266 --> 38:58.735
This is my mother's handwriting.

38:58.769 --> 38:59.869
Yeah.

38:59.904 --> 39:02.972
Maybe now you'll understand
why I didn't want to see you.

39:03.006 --> 39:04.740
Penetrating spinal-cord injury.

39:04.775 --> 39:05.975
Just takes a dime-sized
piece of shrapnel

39:06.009 --> 39:07.977
hitting you in the right place.
You happy now?

39:08.511 --> 39:13.116
- Casey, I had no idea.
- Now you do.

39:13.150 --> 39:16.085
Wait a minute. Wait.
I-I didn't write this.

39:17.321 --> 39:20.991
But if you would have told me,
I would have said the same thing.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.426
It doesn't matter.

39:25.229 --> 39:28.165
It doesn't matter.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.444
Rollerblading? Really?

39:45.249 --> 39:50.854
Yeah, well, I do want
to see you, though.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.923
- Okay.
- I really do.

39:52.957 --> 39:55.792
Just give me some time, okay?

39:55.827 --> 39:57.227
Okay.

40:01.466 --> 40:08.205
Jane?
Please don't watch me leave.

40:10.342 --> 40:11.342
Okay.

41:01.135 --> 41:04.737
I knew you weren't mean.

41:12.680 --> 41:15.979
How did it go?

41:16.013 --> 41:19.049
I asked him to go rollerblading.

41:19.083 --> 41:21.251
Shut the front door.
You did not.

41:21.285 --> 41:23.753
- Oh, yeah, I did.
- Oh, my god.

41:23.788 --> 41:25.655
I think I might have
also suggested running.

41:25.690 --> 41:26.958
Oh.

41:32.563 --> 41:36.666
- Your mother is a dead woman.
- Is a dead woman. Yeah.

41:38.434 --> 41:39.934
