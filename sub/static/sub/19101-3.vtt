00:01.120 --> 00:06.507
"Dear X, you saw me. I really
think you did. And I saw you."

00:08.250 --> 00:11.265
Come on, George, don't
be silly... Get off me!

00:13.399 --> 00:14.839
Who was he?

00:14.839 --> 00:16.959
George Selway. He was at the party.

00:16.959 --> 00:18.479
He works at the university.

00:18.479 --> 00:20.892
Do you want me to get some
people to take a statement?

00:20.917 --> 00:23.239
I can't make a statement,
you know I can't.

00:23.239 --> 00:25.359
What about your husband?
Are you going to tell him?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.599
You haven't been right for weeks.

00:27.599 --> 00:29.239
Is this my fault?

00:29.239 --> 00:31.239
Rosa came with me to the conference.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.999
So you are sleeping with her?

00:34.719 --> 00:37.399
It's George Selway. He
won't leave me alone.

00:37.399 --> 00:40.079
Wait, hang on, are you
saying he's stalking you now?

00:40.079 --> 00:43.759
He's been texting me. A few
weeks ago he sent me flowers!

00:43.759 --> 00:46.719
He just turned up in
the shop near my house.

00:46.719 --> 00:47.879
He knows about us.

00:48.906 --> 00:51.599
I know you're not allowed
to talk about what you do.

00:51.599 --> 00:53.279
Can't you warn him off for me?

00:56.348 --> 00:58.148
What are you going to say to him?

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:12.999 --> 01:15.239
You were in there for
ages. What happened?

01:15.239 --> 01:16.799
Drive. Now, now!

01:18.399 --> 01:20.079
Just go! Go, go, go!

01:25.079 --> 01:26.719
- What is it?
- Just go! Go, go, go!

01:26.719 --> 01:28.439
What's wrong? What happened?

01:34.239 --> 01:36.599
What did he say?

01:36.599 --> 01:38.959
No, listen. Everything's under control.

01:38.959 --> 01:40.879
Just... If it comes to
it. IF it comes to it,

01:40.879 --> 01:43.799
just stick to the same
story as with Kevin, right?

01:43.799 --> 01:46.119
We met through work. Erm, you...

01:46.144 --> 01:49.439
We talked about my niece,
and you asked my advice,

01:49.439 --> 01:51.679
erm... because of my
contacts in security.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.639
That's it. End of story.

01:53.639 --> 01:55.679
I'll say exactly the same thing.

01:55.679 --> 01:58.239
Do we need to call the police?

01:58.239 --> 02:01.879
No, just... Trust me, Yvonne.

02:01.879 --> 02:02.879
Trust me.

02:30.639 --> 02:33.599
So we, erm... We'd better
not be in touch for a while.

02:33.599 --> 02:36.719
Er... just in case, give me
your phone... Give it to me.

02:50.399 --> 02:53.839
Everything's going to be OK.
Right, just stick to the story.

02:53.839 --> 02:56.079
- OK. Yeah.
- All right?

03:02.439 --> 03:04.279
It'll be fine.

03:04.279 --> 03:05.999
I'll see you in Apple Tree Yard.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.170
Mark!

04:24.074 --> 04:27.634
I'm... erm... going out for a bit.

04:29.607 --> 04:31.607
Right.

04:31.632 --> 04:33.312
Are we still on for tonight?

04:37.327 --> 04:41.759
Sathnam's birthday.
Von, are you all right?

04:41.759 --> 04:47.083
Oh, God, yeah... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Um... hormone brain.

04:48.239 --> 04:51.841
Yes, I've booked a
table. "All you can eat."

04:54.119 --> 04:55.079
Great.

05:00.190 --> 05:02.639
Remind me what we've got him again.

05:02.639 --> 05:04.759
That speaker he wanted.

05:04.759 --> 05:06.919
It's the same one we've
got in the kitchen.

05:06.919 --> 05:08.679
Oh, yes, yes. Excellent...

05:10.556 --> 05:11.796
Excellent.

05:25.431 --> 05:28.631
You should know this... thing with Rosa.

05:30.253 --> 05:32.093
Whatever it is, it's not serious.

05:34.639 --> 05:35.519
Right.

05:37.559 --> 05:39.799
Are you sure she feels the same way?

05:39.799 --> 05:43.439
She knows how I feel about
you, I've made it very clear...

05:44.839 --> 05:46.159
Right.

05:48.919 --> 05:52.399
I'm sorry, Von.

05:52.399 --> 05:54.239
I really am.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.199
We've been through worse, hm?

06:05.199 --> 06:06.879
With Adam.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.279
Get a room, you two!

06:20.279 --> 06:23.199
- Hey!
- Hey, how you doing?

06:23.199 --> 06:24.479
Happy birthday.

06:24.479 --> 06:27.119
Hey, you! I didn't know you were coming!

06:27.119 --> 06:29.771
I'm stealing the limelight from Sathnam.

06:30.497 --> 06:33.319
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

06:33.319 --> 06:36.719
He is much too popular in
this family for my liking!

06:36.719 --> 06:39.439
Last time you were kipping on our sofa.

07:04.264 --> 07:06.254
- Yvonne Carmichael?
- Yes.

07:06.279 --> 07:08.559
I'm DI Cleveland, West
Thames Murder Investigation Unit.

07:08.559 --> 07:10.239
This is my colleague, DS Brown.

07:10.239 --> 07:12.959
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of George Selway.

07:12.959 --> 07:14.279
Murder?

07:27.637 --> 07:30.919
Hang on, hang on, there must
be something wrong here...

07:39.679 --> 07:41.279
All right, all right.

07:41.279 --> 07:44.199
It's just a mistake. Grab your bag,
grab your stuff, grab your stuff.

07:44.199 --> 07:45.759
Get your coat. Come on.

07:45.759 --> 07:48.159
Tell us what you did
this morning, Yvonne.

07:48.159 --> 07:51.199
Erm, I took some clothes
to the recycling depot.

07:51.199 --> 07:52.639
Alone?

07:52.639 --> 07:53.679
Yes.

07:53.679 --> 07:54.586
Then what?

07:54.611 --> 07:57.076
Um... Then I went for a drive.

07:58.399 --> 08:00.359
You just fancied a drive?

08:00.359 --> 08:03.159
That's right. Af... after
I'd done the recycling.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.799
Where?

08:08.599 --> 08:11.119
Just around. I... I don't remember.

08:11.119 --> 08:15.685
Around? I see. Was anyone
in the car with you?

08:16.284 --> 08:17.284
No.

08:18.828 --> 08:21.068
You do know we've arrested Mark Costley?

08:25.119 --> 08:28.359
Were you there when Mark Costley
beat and kicked George Selway

08:28.359 --> 08:29.519
to death, Yvonne?

08:33.289 --> 08:36.318
No... No.

08:36.318 --> 08:38.799
It's very easy for us to
check all this out, you know.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.679
Who was in the car with
you, where you were...

08:40.679 --> 08:43.119
that's even before we've had
a proper chat with Costley.

08:43.119 --> 08:45.799
God knows what he'll have
to say for himself, eh?

08:51.939 --> 08:55.139
So, are you telling me
that's not you... in your car?

09:10.733 --> 09:13.359
What's your relationship
to Mark Costley, Yvonne?

09:13.359 --> 09:14.399
He's a friend.

09:14.399 --> 09:15.719
What kind of friend?

09:15.719 --> 09:17.799
Just a friend. I... I
haven't known him very long.

09:17.799 --> 09:19.719
Well, would you describe
him as a good friend?

09:19.719 --> 09:21.479
He's become quite a good friend, yes.

09:21.479 --> 09:22.559
A lover?

09:22.559 --> 09:23.679
No.

09:23.679 --> 09:27.719
I... I met him when I was
working at the House of Commons.

09:27.719 --> 09:30.879
Um... He asked my advice
about a niece of his,

09:30.879 --> 09:33.359
who was considering a career in science.

09:33.359 --> 09:36.399
So why was he in your car,
going to George Selway's house?

09:41.635 --> 09:47.751
Since Mark worked in security,
I asked him for advice.

09:50.159 --> 09:52.239
He agreed to help me out.

09:52.239 --> 09:54.559
To warn George Selway off.

09:54.559 --> 09:56.359
Why would you want him to do that?

10:07.719 --> 10:09.279
George Selway attacked me.

10:25.519 --> 10:30.279
So, you and Mark Costley were an
item. You were sleeping together.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.879
No, I've told you.

10:31.879 --> 10:34.559
You were having an affair
and he went nuts when

10:34.559 --> 10:36.839
he found out about you and
George, isn't that right?

10:38.239 --> 10:40.399
There was no "me and George".

10:40.399 --> 10:45.479
I told you, George Selway attacked
me and then he started stalking me.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.879
I went to Mark Costley because
of his background in security

10:48.879 --> 10:51.479
and asked for his advice.

10:51.479 --> 10:52.839
That's not what he told us.

11:02.599 --> 11:04.159
Just stick to the story.

11:04.159 --> 11:05.159
Trust me.

11:07.879 --> 11:10.559
We weren't sleeping together.

11:10.559 --> 11:11.919
And if he'd told you we were,

11:11.919 --> 11:14.439
I think you'd be
confronting me with details.

11:21.439 --> 11:24.679
Just for that moment I doubted you...

11:24.679 --> 11:29.079
Just for that split second.
Forgive me, my love.

11:32.679 --> 11:37.119
Jaspreet Dhillon. Dhillon,
Johnson & Waterford. You can call me Jas.

11:38.679 --> 11:44.039
I can tell you, your husband
is an extremely persistent man.

11:44.039 --> 11:46.319
Gary contacted you?

11:46.319 --> 11:50.959
Yeah, and not just the once,
either. Now, good news.

11:50.959 --> 11:52.839
We've started your bail application.

11:52.839 --> 11:54.239
How long's that going to take?

11:54.239 --> 11:55.879
That's the less good news.

11:55.879 --> 11:58.959
Magistrate's hearing first, probably
a couple of nights in Holloway,

11:58.959 --> 12:00.879
then bail hearing proper...

12:00.879 --> 12:03.359
Holloway? It really should
just be for a night or two.

12:03.359 --> 12:06.399
I'm fairly confident the
bail hearing will go our way.

12:07.215 --> 12:09.559
We'll get you home if we possibly can.

12:09.559 --> 12:11.279
Oh, thank God.

12:11.279 --> 12:12.359
Sorry.

12:14.719 --> 12:16.519
Would you like some water?

12:28.039 --> 12:30.399
They keep talking about murder, but I...

12:30.399 --> 12:32.359
I wasn't even in the house.

12:32.359 --> 12:34.279
Surely forensics will tell them that.

12:34.279 --> 12:35.559
It doesn't matter, Yvonne.

12:35.559 --> 12:36.839
The prosecution will argue

12:36.839 --> 12:39.679
that you and Costley cooked up
the idea to kill Selway together.

12:42.391 --> 12:45.079
That you drove the car. The
getaway car, effectively.

12:45.079 --> 12:47.759
That is not what happened! I
didn't even know he was dead.

12:47.759 --> 12:48.799
I swear I didn't.

12:49.930 --> 12:54.957
The worst I thought was... Mark
might have knocked him about a bit.

12:56.410 --> 12:59.079
Well, we'll establish all that
when your case comes to court.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.279
For the moment, let's
focus on bail, yeah?

13:06.439 --> 13:09.639
I'm just about persuaded to
give bail in the particular

13:09.639 --> 13:13.159
circumstances of this case, despite
the seriousness of the charge,

13:13.159 --> 13:15.919
due to the defendant's
previous excellent character

13:15.919 --> 13:17.839
and everything else that's been said.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.119
You're to reside at your normal address

13:20.119 --> 13:22.199
and you must surrender your passport

13:22.199 --> 13:26.239
and pay into court a security
in the sum of £100,000.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.719
I understand it's all in hand, my lady.

13:28.719 --> 13:31.399
You're to report to your local
police station on Mondays,

13:31.399 --> 13:34.799
Wednesdays and Saturdays
between 10am and 2pm.

13:34.799 --> 13:39.799
You will also abide by a curfew
between the hours of 8pm and 8am.

13:39.799 --> 13:43.079
Above all, Dr Carmichael,
you are not to contact,

13:43.079 --> 13:45.279
directly or indirectly,

13:45.279 --> 13:49.559
Mark Liam Costley or any of
the prosecution witnesses.

13:49.559 --> 13:51.439
Is that clear?

13:51.439 --> 13:52.799
Yes, my lady. Thank you.

14:23.879 --> 14:26.639
How on earth did you
get hold of 100 grand?

14:28.119 --> 14:29.399
Cashed in those bonds.

14:31.759 --> 14:34.319
And Ray and Tina have
come up trumps, actually.

14:34.319 --> 14:35.999
Oh, God, you didn't ask them, did you?

14:35.999 --> 14:39.919
Well, what else could
I do? It's all right.

14:39.919 --> 14:43.599
We're re-mortgaging, and... Ray
and Tina just stepped in to cover

14:43.599 --> 14:46.039
it while the paperwork's done.

14:46.039 --> 14:47.999
They were happy to help, Von.

14:50.119 --> 14:51.599
People have been amazing.

14:56.159 --> 14:57.159
Adam?

15:00.399 --> 15:04.919
He's been a bit knocked
for six... But fine.

15:06.359 --> 15:08.039
I've talked to him quite a lot.

15:11.639 --> 15:13.559
What about Carrie?

15:34.839 --> 15:35.799
Hey...

15:48.559 --> 15:50.039
This is lovely. Thank you.

16:00.279 --> 16:01.919
It's delicious. Mm.

16:13.799 --> 16:16.879
Why didn't you go to the
police about the rape?

16:16.879 --> 16:18.079
Carrie, love...

16:18.079 --> 16:20.359
Maybe your mum's not
ready to talk about that

16:20.359 --> 16:21.959
right at the moment, darling.

16:21.959 --> 16:25.319
I haven't had a chance to talk
to Dad about it properly yet.

16:32.079 --> 16:33.799
I had my reasons.

16:35.239 --> 16:39.439
But, um... I mean, didn't you
feel a responsibility to the other

16:39.439 --> 16:42.239
women this man was working
with, to come forward

16:42.239 --> 16:43.759
if he was a threat to them?

16:45.359 --> 16:46.999
And this other man, what's his name?

16:46.999 --> 16:49.919
Mark Costley. Just roping in some
random weirdo, what was that about?

16:49.919 --> 16:51.159
He's not a weirdo.

16:51.159 --> 16:53.679
But you didn't even know him
properly, what were you thinking?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.079
I don't know! I don't know.

17:00.413 --> 17:05.079
Carrie... I wasn't thinking
about my responsibilities.

17:06.307 --> 17:09.872
I could barely put one
foot in front of the other.

17:11.799 --> 17:15.719
And sometimes women aren't served
brilliantly by the legal system,

17:15.719 --> 17:19.559
whatever they say about new
approaches and the caring

17:19.559 --> 17:21.039
face of the force.

17:25.199 --> 17:26.919
I just couldn't face it.

17:31.559 --> 17:33.559
I didn't have the courage.

17:36.239 --> 17:38.199
I'm just trying to understand.

17:43.199 --> 17:45.319
I'm going to go and have a bath.

18:04.919 --> 18:07.639
Fred. Fred. Everything
will be all right.

18:07.639 --> 18:10.359
For God's sake, Dad, I'm
not ten years old any more.

18:17.159 --> 18:18.159
What if it isn't?

18:34.439 --> 18:39.251
I just don't get why you
went to him. Costley.

18:41.889 --> 18:45.009
I knew that if I told
you what had happened...

18:46.599 --> 18:48.599
..you'd want me to go to the police.

18:53.991 --> 18:55.911
When did it happen?

18:58.599 --> 19:03.759
It was that party at Central.
Jonathan's leaving do.

19:03.759 --> 19:05.639
He was a senior researcher there.

19:06.471 --> 19:11.155
We did external exams
and panels together.

19:12.737 --> 19:14.777
You've probably heard me mention him.

19:16.512 --> 19:18.032
Oh, Jesus...

19:21.039 --> 19:26.799
Von... I mean, the police,
I understand what you

19:26.799 --> 19:32.039
were saying to Carrie, but surely
we could have spoken about it.

19:36.439 --> 19:42.239
At first, I didn't want the rest
of my life to be contaminated

19:42.239 --> 19:43.359
by what he did.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.319
As long as I didn't bring it
into the house then I could

19:49.319 --> 19:51.119
pretend it never happened.

19:53.039 --> 19:54.759
And then I took advice.

19:57.359 --> 19:59.239
From Costley.

19:59.239 --> 20:04.319
No, from a police officer
that he put me in touch with...

20:07.439 --> 20:09.159
They see it all the time.

20:10.559 --> 20:13.879
Women like me who don't want to
have their lives dragged through

20:13.879 --> 20:15.079
the courts.

20:15.079 --> 20:18.319
Yeah, thank God we're not going
to be dragged through the courts.

20:18.319 --> 20:20.559
Thank God you spared us from that.

20:22.399 --> 20:23.919
I'm sorry.

20:26.524 --> 20:28.604
It's all gone so wrong.

20:34.199 --> 20:38.559
Oh, my God, he's dead!
He's actually dead!

20:41.559 --> 20:42.959
Sh, sh...

20:47.279 --> 20:50.759
It's not your fault. None
of this is your fault.

20:50.759 --> 20:52.559
OK?

20:52.559 --> 20:55.279
That's not true, Gary.

20:55.279 --> 20:56.439
It isn't.

20:58.639 --> 21:02.839
You weren't even there
when it happened. Were you?

21:02.839 --> 21:05.956
No. No.

21:10.799 --> 21:16.279
George Selway raped you.
It all goes from there.

21:19.119 --> 21:21.199
And we are going to do everything...

21:23.248 --> 21:25.208
...everything we can, OK?

21:53.279 --> 21:55.479
Apparently lolly sticks are good.

21:56.599 --> 21:58.279
For scratching.

22:00.559 --> 22:01.999
Stylish...

22:10.559 --> 22:13.239
We've had word from Mark
Costley's team about his plea.

22:13.239 --> 22:16.279
Looks like he's going for
diminished responsibility.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.559
He's saying he's not guilty of murder.

22:20.559 --> 22:23.719
Well, good, because he
isn't. He couldn't be.

22:23.719 --> 22:25.919
Do you know that?

22:25.919 --> 22:29.119
Well, it makes no sense.
Why not self-defence?

22:29.119 --> 22:31.559
Yvonne, I have to say,
Mark Costley's defence is

22:31.559 --> 22:33.479
a matter for him and his solicitors.

22:33.479 --> 22:35.039
My job is to defend you.

22:35.039 --> 22:37.479
But, if we're being charged together...

22:37.479 --> 22:40.279
Costley's effectively pleading
guilty to manslaughter by

22:40.279 --> 22:43.519
going for diminished
responsibility as his defence.

22:43.519 --> 22:46.239
So we'll both be charged
with Selway's manslaughter?

22:46.239 --> 22:50.319
No. If they accept Costley's plea,
and that's by no means guaranteed,

22:50.319 --> 22:53.319
they still can come after you for murder

22:53.319 --> 22:55.639
because your defences
are entirely separate.

22:55.639 --> 22:59.719
But it's not all doom and gloom...
At the very least, if they

22:59.719 --> 23:02.359
accept diminished responsibility,
it makes our lives easier.

23:02.359 --> 23:03.719
You're saying you had

23:03.719 --> 23:06.719
no idea Costley was going to
kill George Selway and Costley is

23:06.719 --> 23:10.039
admitting that he acted on a
reckless impulse of his own.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.186
You...

23:32.345 --> 23:35.305
you are my knight in shining armour.

23:37.359 --> 23:43.439
You've admitted you acted
alone. Keeping me safe.

23:43.439 --> 23:44.999
Again.

24:12.079 --> 24:13.759
Hey, Dad...

24:13.759 --> 24:15.879
Hey, hello, love! How are you?

24:15.879 --> 24:17.439
Good... You?

24:17.439 --> 24:19.159
Carrie's here, love!

24:22.799 --> 24:26.039
Sathnam's going to go
part-time after the baby's born.

24:26.039 --> 24:28.199
It's his baby, too.

24:28.199 --> 24:30.439
Of course it is! That's great.

24:31.759 --> 24:33.011
No, that's great.

24:34.202 --> 24:35.762
I'm a bit jealous, actually.

24:38.011 --> 24:42.119
Well, your dad did a lot for the
two of you when you were babies

24:42.119 --> 24:45.919
but it was always basically
assumed that you were my territory.

24:47.079 --> 24:50.159
Well, didn't you talk it
over before you got pregnant?

24:50.159 --> 24:53.279
We've never really been
good at that. Talking.

24:53.279 --> 24:54.879
That's not true!

24:54.879 --> 24:58.039
Sathnam always says he wishes
his parents got on half as well

24:58.039 --> 24:59.279
as you and Dad.

24:59.279 --> 25:01.039
I'm not saying we don't get on.

25:10.607 --> 25:15.759
Oh... I'm so sorry, all of this
is such terrible timing for you.

25:15.759 --> 25:20.919
I mean, no timing would be
good, but this is godawful.

25:29.599 --> 25:31.599
Ajay, Sathnam's brother,

25:31.599 --> 25:34.119
he has this friend from uni,
trained as a barrister...

25:34.119 --> 25:35.479
We've got a barrister.

25:35.479 --> 25:37.039
Well, he does consultancy now.

25:37.039 --> 25:40.839
Sort of PR... helping people to
make a good impression in court.

25:40.839 --> 25:42.839
Dad asked me to get his number.

25:46.279 --> 25:48.439
The two of you have discussed it?

25:50.159 --> 25:53.079
You really think that I need
help, making a good impression?

25:53.079 --> 25:57.639
Well, don't you? Er, shall
I send it to you, or Dad?

25:57.639 --> 26:00.079
The thing to remember is, I'm innocent.

26:01.799 --> 26:05.639
Of course you are. I know
you are, of course you are.

26:05.639 --> 26:08.131
I'm just... sending it to Dad, OK?

26:24.319 --> 26:26.999
- He seems quite young!
- Yeah?

26:26.999 --> 26:28.479
Well, he would be.

26:42.399 --> 26:44.919
Just remember, love,
he's costing a fortune.

26:44.919 --> 26:49.599
Don't get all competitive with him. Von?

26:52.651 --> 26:55.239
Er... competitive?

26:55.239 --> 26:56.759
Let him do his job.

26:56.759 --> 27:00.079
Let him help you, that's
what he's here for.

27:00.079 --> 27:01.399
Yeah.

27:05.279 --> 27:07.479
- Hi. Laurence?
- Yeah.

27:07.479 --> 27:10.199
Hi, I'm Gary, I'm Yvonne's husband.

27:12.119 --> 27:16.208
So, Yvonne, are you guilty?

27:17.116 --> 27:19.239
No, Laurence, I am not.

27:22.279 --> 27:26.039
Cool! That's what we
want to see in court.

27:26.039 --> 27:29.879
Firm, but polite, no hint of doubt.

27:29.879 --> 27:32.079
First impressions are
incredibly important.

27:32.079 --> 27:34.079
Aren't they just?

27:34.079 --> 27:37.679
So, on that subject, is there
anything Yvonne should be

27:37.679 --> 27:40.199
thinking of, in court?

27:40.199 --> 27:44.399
The jury, always. Little tip.

27:44.399 --> 27:47.159
When you're in the witness box,
point your feet towards the jury.

27:47.159 --> 27:50.079
Then you'll automatically
address your answers towards them.

27:50.079 --> 27:52.639
It's all about making a connection.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.639
You might want to jot this down.

27:55.639 --> 27:58.599
Anything, erm, in particular
she should be wearing?

27:58.599 --> 28:01.959
Well, we want the jury
to see your feminine side.

28:01.959 --> 28:05.359
Oh, Jesus. Ribbons? Lace?

28:06.201 --> 28:10.439
Perhaps a blouse with
a bit of embellishment.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.839
Nothing too low-cut, obviously,

28:12.839 --> 28:16.319
something that's
appropriate to your, er, age.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.639
Under a suit.

28:17.639 --> 28:21.119
But not too flash or designer,
we don't want people thinking

28:21.119 --> 28:22.839
you need taking down a peg or two.

28:22.839 --> 28:26.199
People only judge you
30% on what you say.

28:26.199 --> 28:28.639
70% is how you look.

28:29.719 --> 28:32.599
None of this is me, you understand.

28:32.599 --> 28:36.319
The women, particularly, can
be very hard on other women.

28:36.319 --> 28:39.319
Talking of... I... I don't know
if the prosecuting counsel will be

28:39.319 --> 28:40.639
a man or a woman.

28:40.639 --> 28:43.479
But if it is a woman, the jury
will be more likely to think

28:43.479 --> 28:45.879
you're guilty during cross-examination
about the rape.

28:45.879 --> 28:49.559
Ah, you know, "This nice lady
barrister wouldn't be taking this on

28:49.559 --> 28:52.639
if she really thought this man
had done something terrible."

28:52.639 --> 28:55.559
I also imagine this
strategy won't have escaped

28:55.559 --> 28:59.159
Mr... Costley's defence team.

28:59.159 --> 29:01.399
He may well have a female silk.

29:01.399 --> 29:04.319
You do know how violent the rape was?

29:04.319 --> 29:08.559
Yes, I've got the... details.

29:10.479 --> 29:13.919
I'm sure your solicitor has been
through this with you, Yvonne,

29:13.919 --> 29:17.039
but, er... legally speaking,
I'm afraid it does make

29:17.039 --> 29:18.559
your case rather worse.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.079
An attack of this
severity gives you such

29:22.079 --> 29:24.399
a strong reason for killing Selway.

29:24.399 --> 29:29.159
So, basically everything that
should be in Yvonne's favour is

29:29.159 --> 29:31.839
going to go against her...

29:31.839 --> 29:33.399
Exactly.

29:37.159 --> 29:39.479
Of course, one thing the rape

29:39.479 --> 29:43.559
doesn't explain is why
Mark Costley killed Selway.

29:46.279 --> 29:49.399
Why did your co-defendant
act as he did?

29:49.399 --> 29:52.879
He was warning off George
Selway as a favour to me.

29:54.279 --> 29:56.079
He has a background in security.

29:57.599 --> 30:00.599
And it must have gone wrong in
some terrible, terrible, way.

30:01.879 --> 30:06.759
Quite a favour. You hadn't known
each other that long, had you?

30:08.199 --> 30:09.839
A few months.

30:09.839 --> 30:11.239
Mmm.

30:12.679 --> 30:14.879
The prosecution could try to claim

30:14.879 --> 30:17.159
you were lying about the whole thing,

30:17.159 --> 30:20.279
that you and Selway had
consensual sex and you were

30:20.279 --> 30:23.719
spinning Costley a yarn
to get him into trouble.

30:23.719 --> 30:27.079
Why the hell would Yvonne do
that unless she was a lunatic?

30:27.079 --> 30:28.559
Ah, who knows?

30:28.559 --> 30:31.319
You were annoyed with Selway because
he didn't call you afterwards,

30:31.319 --> 30:32.839
de-da, de-da, the usual.

30:32.839 --> 30:33.959
The usual?

30:33.959 --> 30:36.359
I'm just playing devil's advocate here.

30:36.359 --> 30:38.919
Why didn't you report the
rape in the first case,

30:38.919 --> 30:41.159
if there was evidence?
It's a big problem.

30:41.159 --> 30:44.799
And if there wasn't evidence, does
that mean you didn't fight back?

30:44.799 --> 30:45.759
Why not?

30:46.919 --> 30:48.319
We see it the whole time.

30:48.319 --> 30:51.039
You ladies do make our
job rather difficult.

30:52.199 --> 30:53.799
What are you thinking, Laurence?

30:53.799 --> 30:56.479
Shall I tell you what's going
on in your head, biologically?

30:56.479 --> 30:58.879
There's a part of your
brain, the amygdala,

30:58.879 --> 31:01.319
it's telling you to do whatever
you need to do to survive.

31:01.319 --> 31:04.159
It's like a siren, "Survive! Survive!"

31:04.159 --> 31:07.119
So loud, in fact, it's drowning
out your cerebral cortex,

31:07.119 --> 31:08.239
your logical brain.

31:09.399 --> 31:12.759
Your cortex knows I'm not
going to cut your throat.

31:12.759 --> 31:13.919
Why would I do that?

31:13.919 --> 31:16.119
My family's in enough trouble as it is.

31:16.119 --> 31:18.399
But the amygdala, it's pure instinct.

31:19.479 --> 31:21.959
It feels the damage this can do.

31:21.959 --> 31:23.839
It's no bigger than a peanut...

31:25.839 --> 31:30.439
Yet taken by surprise,
afraid for your life...

31:32.959 --> 31:38.559
...we're programmed to do
whatever will ensure our survival.

31:38.559 --> 31:39.919
And sometimes...

31:41.759 --> 31:43.639
...that's nothing.

31:51.639 --> 31:53.719
I think you've made your point.

32:20.399 --> 32:21.639
Gary.

32:29.199 --> 32:31.719
Sorry...

32:31.719 --> 32:33.679
It's going to be OK.

32:33.679 --> 32:37.999
It's all going be OK... I'm sorry.

32:41.251 --> 32:43.331
I'm sorry.

33:37.799 --> 33:39.319
Oh!

33:39.319 --> 33:40.679
God, my ankle!

33:40.679 --> 33:43.079
I'm so sorry. It was the tag. You OK?

33:43.079 --> 33:44.499
Of course...

33:58.399 --> 34:00.519
You OK?

34:18.799 --> 34:20.759
I want you to promise me something.

34:24.159 --> 34:25.879
Aye-aye...

34:30.879 --> 34:35.036
If at any point during the trial,
I don't want you to be there,

34:36.581 --> 34:39.022
I want you to promise
that you'll stay away.

34:42.079 --> 34:44.559
But you know I want to be
there for the whole thing.

34:44.559 --> 34:47.119
Please.

34:47.119 --> 34:50.359
And from what Jas has said,
and that little shitheel,

34:50.359 --> 34:52.478
about making the right impression,

34:52.478 --> 34:55.958
it's really important that I'm
seen to be standing by your side.

34:55.958 --> 34:57.479
I know.

34:57.479 --> 35:00.119
But I don't think I could bear it,

35:00.119 --> 35:03.519
if I have to talk about
what George Selway did.

35:07.719 --> 35:09.159
Please.

35:11.639 --> 35:12.799
OK.

35:22.399 --> 35:24.559
Would you have seen it as a betrayal,

35:24.559 --> 35:26.039
if Gary and I had made love?

35:30.199 --> 35:33.797
Because one thing I do know,
you haven't betrayed me.

35:59.959 --> 36:03.799
No, Mum was great, cool as a cucumber.

36:03.799 --> 36:06.439
It was... It was me that lost it...

36:06.439 --> 36:08.679
Yeah, I know, but you
had to be here, Carrie,

36:08.679 --> 36:10.839
he was absolutely appalling! Babe!

36:10.839 --> 36:13.039
Oh, Suze.

36:14.679 --> 36:16.159
I'm so sorry.

36:16.159 --> 36:18.279
I'm so sorry.

36:22.079 --> 36:24.559
You don't have to talk about
it if you don't want to.

36:24.559 --> 36:25.959
Oh, God.

36:25.959 --> 36:27.919
But if you do... I'm here.

36:28.482 --> 36:31.039
I wish I'd talked to you.

36:31.039 --> 36:33.719
I wish I'd talked to
you about everything.

36:33.719 --> 36:38.919
Well, like my mum says,
"Still waters run deep."

36:38.919 --> 36:41.719
She doesn't know the half of it.

36:43.479 --> 36:44.919
I'll get it.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.853
Yvonne!

36:48.878 --> 36:52.039
Yvonne Carmichael, I'm arresting
you for breaching the conditions

36:52.039 --> 36:53.559
- of your bail.
- I'll call Jaspreet.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.679
You might want to get a
few things together for her.

36:55.679 --> 36:57.079
What are you doing?

36:57.079 --> 36:59.519
Look, there is no need for that.
She's not going to run away!

36:59.519 --> 37:01.919
This is crazy! I haven't done
anything! I haven't done anything!

37:01.919 --> 37:03.559
I'll be right behind
you in the car, love.

37:03.559 --> 37:05.679
Suse, could you give me a hand, please?

37:07.037 --> 37:10.399
Mark Costley sent you a text
from prison and you replied,

37:10.399 --> 37:11.679
is that right?

37:11.679 --> 37:14.559
I got a text from a number
that I didn't recognise.

37:14.559 --> 37:17.239
And I just asked who it was.

37:17.239 --> 37:18.679
And you sent a second text.

37:21.199 --> 37:24.919
It doesn't matter. The point is,
he made contact and you responded.

37:24.919 --> 37:27.239
Which is breaching the
conditions of your bail.

37:27.239 --> 37:29.759
But he's not even supposed to
have a phone in prison, is he?

37:29.759 --> 37:32.719
Well, clearly he got hold
of one. I'm sorry, Yvonne.

37:32.719 --> 37:35.039
You'll be kept in Holloway on remand.

37:44.159 --> 37:46.599
At least we're close to the trial date.

37:46.599 --> 37:50.359
It could be deliberate, on
Costley's part. Tit for tat.

37:50.359 --> 37:52.159
He's in prison, so why not you?

37:52.159 --> 37:53.239
He's not like that.

37:54.679 --> 37:55.919
Isn't he?

38:06.919 --> 38:09.759
He has a niece that's good
at science, is that right?

38:09.759 --> 38:11.119
Yeah.

38:11.119 --> 38:14.719
My eldest daughter's into science.

38:14.719 --> 38:16.159
That's always good to hear.

38:16.159 --> 38:17.159
Yeah.

38:17.950 --> 38:21.839
Yes, er, she showed me this
thing. I'm not sure she should be

38:21.839 --> 38:24.439
watching it, to be honest with you,

38:24.439 --> 38:27.199
but, uh... I suppose it's educational.

38:28.679 --> 38:29.919
You've probably seen it.

38:29.919 --> 38:33.479
This American who did experiments
with monkeys in the 1950s,

38:33.479 --> 38:36.879
on animal behaviour. Rice,
I think he was called...

38:36.879 --> 38:39.319
It's not really my
field, animal behaviour.

38:39.319 --> 38:41.279
There's a mother, er, with a baby,

38:41.279 --> 38:45.839
and, uh... there's a heating element
on the floor of the monkey cage.

38:47.279 --> 38:51.319
It's pretty horrible,
actually. No Wi-Fi.

38:58.559 --> 39:01.079
I think it's supposed to be
an experiment in altruism.

39:01.079 --> 39:04.199
They keep increasing the
temperature of the cage floor.

39:04.199 --> 39:07.439
The worst thing is, in the end,
when its feet are burning...

39:07.439 --> 39:09.119
I suppose it's in so much pain.

39:10.999 --> 39:14.559
The monkey, it just drops
its baby and stands on it.

39:14.559 --> 39:15.919
Jesus.

39:20.039 --> 39:22.639
Still, it's interesting, though.

39:22.639 --> 39:25.999
The tipping point...
and self-preservation.

39:28.719 --> 39:31.199
You think Mark Costley's
reached his tipping point?

39:32.319 --> 39:34.919
It's worth bearing in mind.

39:41.279 --> 39:45.341
The text Mark Costley sent you...
What did it mean, anyway?

39:46.359 --> 39:48.639
The Wedekind experiment?

39:48.639 --> 39:51.359
Oh, um, well, it was just
an experiment that I was

39:51.359 --> 39:53.719
involved in, early
on in my career and...

39:55.039 --> 39:58.399
I... I must have told him
about it when we were t...

39:58.399 --> 40:02.639
talking about his niece. The
one who's interested in science.

40:04.039 --> 40:05.599
Like your daughter.

40:18.999 --> 40:22.919
You were definitely the first person...

40:24.559 --> 40:27.999
...to qualify the Wedekind experiment.

40:29.439 --> 40:30.439
Yeah!

40:39.479 --> 40:41.799
No tipping point. For either of us.

40:44.119 --> 40:47.999
You wanted to let me know
that you're keeping the faith.

40:47.999 --> 40:49.519
How can I blame you for that?

41:35.286 --> 41:37.959
So, the order of the
prosecution witnesses...

41:40.479 --> 41:42.799
Feeling OK, Yvonne?

41:42.799 --> 41:45.999
I'm relieved we're starting,
but I'm dreading it.

41:45.999 --> 41:46.959
Of course.

41:48.399 --> 41:50.959
You won't be called for a
very long time, Dr Carmichael.

41:50.959 --> 41:53.239
I'm not sure if that makes it worse...

41:53.239 --> 41:56.159
But do bear in mind the jury will
be able to see you throughout.

41:56.159 --> 41:57.999
Just try to stay composed if you can.

42:02.239 --> 42:04.119
What are "special measures"?

42:04.119 --> 42:07.319
Yes, that's the witness that
needs to retain anonymity.

42:07.319 --> 42:08.759
The MI5 man, yes?

42:08.759 --> 42:09.879
Yeah.

42:09.879 --> 42:10.959
Exciting times.

42:12.639 --> 42:14.479
So, Yvonne, anything
else to tell Robert?

42:14.479 --> 42:16.839
Or anything else you need to know?

42:16.839 --> 42:20.279
Um... No... I think that
covers it. Thank you.

42:22.239 --> 42:23.679
Good luck.

42:23.679 --> 42:25.839
Luck has nothing to do with it.

44:14.999 --> 44:18.959
All persons having anything to
do at the Central Criminal Court

44:18.959 --> 44:21.519
draw near and give your attendance.

44:34.639 --> 44:36.919
I don't seem to have a batting order.

45:12.953 --> 45:17.519
You fucking bitch! You
deserve everything you get!

45:18.319 --> 45:20.039
You bitch, you evil bitch!

45:20.039 --> 45:23.039
- Look at what you're doing to all of us...
- Calm down.

45:23.039 --> 45:26.679
I have two children at home
who have broken their hearts

45:26.679 --> 45:30.199
because their father is there,

45:30.199 --> 45:32.999
that you have brought into your mess...

45:43.919 --> 45:46.999
My lord... Ladies and gentlemen.

45:47.999 --> 45:51.559
You will hear two defences
being offered in this court.

45:51.559 --> 45:54.839
You will hear medical evidence
concerning the claim of the

45:54.839 --> 45:57.559
first defendant, Mark Liam Costley,

45:57.559 --> 46:01.119
that he should be found not
guilty of murder on grounds of

46:01.119 --> 46:04.919
diminished responsibility,
that he is not responsible for

46:04.919 --> 46:09.679
killing George Selway because
he has a personality disorder.

46:09.679 --> 46:12.999
His defence will argue that
he is mentally unstable.

46:12.999 --> 46:16.359
You will also hear evidence
from the second defendant,

46:16.359 --> 46:20.999
Yvonne Carmichael, that
she is entirely innocent,

46:20.999 --> 46:24.479
that she knew nothing of Mr
Costley's intentions when she

46:24.479 --> 46:28.679
drove him to the doorstep of a man
who had viciously assaulted her.

46:29.879 --> 46:34.559
When questioned by the police,
this eminent scientist claimed

46:34.559 --> 46:39.039
that she had no idea what might be
going on when she sat waiting in her

46:39.039 --> 46:44.119
car outside that property, waiting,

46:44.119 --> 46:47.599
and waiting... and waiting.

46:49.119 --> 46:52.679
The police were told that she had
no thought whatsoever something

46:52.679 --> 46:57.759
might be amiss when Mr Costley took
so long to return, having changed

46:57.759 --> 47:02.799
some of his clothing but having
neglected to change his shoes,

47:02.799 --> 47:08.079
the shoes that transferred blood to
the mat in the footwell of her car.

47:09.799 --> 47:12.892
The prosecution's case is
that this is all nonsense.

47:14.593 --> 47:15.726
Mark Liam Costley

47:15.751 --> 47:19.359
and Yvonne Carmichael planned
and connived, quite coldly and in

47:19.359 --> 47:23.799
advance, that one would do the deed
and the other drive the getaway car.

47:23.799 --> 47:27.999
Each encouraged and facilitated
the other's behaviour. And each,

47:27.999 --> 47:30.559
therefore, is as guilty as the other,

47:30.559 --> 47:33.999
of the murder of George Simon Selway.

47:39.319 --> 47:42.839
It might be an idea to get something
down, if you can, Dr Carmichael.

47:42.839 --> 47:45.159
After lunch we're in for the long haul.

47:45.159 --> 47:46.319
Ladies and gentlemen,

47:46.319 --> 47:49.559
may I invite you to turn to the
first page of the jury bundle?

47:49.559 --> 47:53.279
Maps, photographs, forensic diagrams,

47:53.279 --> 47:55.879
it's nothing to worry about.

47:55.879 --> 47:56.839
Smoke and mirrors.

47:58.759 --> 48:01.639
The prosecution just want to
hammer it home, essentially.

48:01.639 --> 48:03.199
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

48:03.199 --> 48:06.679
The woman you saw sitting in the
car outside George Selway's flat.

48:06.679 --> 48:09.199
Can you point her out
to the court, please?

48:11.879 --> 48:14.719
I'm afraid Miss Bonnard,
Mr Costley's barrister,

48:14.719 --> 48:16.719
might pile on the agony a bit as well.

48:16.719 --> 48:20.719
Brand-new silk. They always want to
cross-examine every single witness.

48:20.719 --> 48:22.439
Isn't that what you'll be doing?

48:22.439 --> 48:23.879
No.

48:23.879 --> 48:26.279
I have no questions for
the witness, my lord.

48:28.399 --> 48:30.359
No cross-exam from us.

48:30.359 --> 48:32.359
An innocent woman doesn't
need to get bogged down

48:32.359 --> 48:33.879
in the sordid details.

48:35.359 --> 48:36.639
That's our message.

48:39.159 --> 48:42.799
Can you clarify, Dr Weatherfield,
what kind of force would have

48:42.799 --> 48:47.839
been needed to cause this level of
injury to the victim's neck area?

48:47.839 --> 48:50.959
It would have to be a blunt
trauma injury of some force,

48:50.959 --> 48:54.679
consistent with stamping while the
victim was face up on the floor.

48:54.679 --> 48:58.239
And how can you tell that this
force would have been considerable?

48:58.239 --> 48:59.479
The bruising.

48:59.479 --> 49:04.439
You can see the clear imprint of
the attacker's trainer on the torso.

49:04.439 --> 49:07.319
And the victim's voice
box was shattered.

49:07.319 --> 49:11.079
In order to sustain that level
of injury, I would say that the

49:11.079 --> 49:15.039
person applying the force
would perhaps have been jumping

49:15.039 --> 49:17.399
while he or she stamped on him.

49:17.399 --> 49:20.679
What was the extent of
the injury to the nose?

49:20.679 --> 49:24.279
The nose was almost certainly
broken by a blow before the victim

49:24.279 --> 49:27.839
was on the ground, perhaps as
a way of initiating the attack.

49:28.919 --> 49:32.439
There was considerable blood from
the nose on the victim's clothes.

49:32.439 --> 49:35.799
Once he was on his back,
that wouldn't have flowed

49:35.799 --> 49:37.839
vertically down his clothes.

49:39.359 --> 49:41.679
Thank you. No further
questions, my lord.

49:42.601 --> 49:45.039
Can we be clear on
this, Dr Weatherfield?

49:45.039 --> 49:49.039
Could the dilution of blood on
the victim's clothes have been

49:49.039 --> 49:51.679
caused by him emptying his bladder?

49:51.679 --> 49:54.879
Rather than any purposeful dilution
of the blood by Mr Costley in

49:54.879 --> 49:57.039
an attempt at clearing up after death?

49:57.039 --> 49:58.959
Well... it could.

49:58.959 --> 50:03.279
It's correct there were no tests
done on the diluting component.

50:03.279 --> 50:05.719
So it could have been urine?

50:05.719 --> 50:07.279
It could have been...

50:07.279 --> 50:10.959
Thank you. No further questions
on behalf of Mr Costley.

50:13.119 --> 50:16.079
My lord, I have no
questions for this witness.

50:25.159 --> 50:29.639
How did it go so far?
Did he provoke you?

50:31.799 --> 50:34.239
Is this what you've been trained to do?

50:44.879 --> 50:47.359
It's not looking good for him, is it?

50:50.479 --> 50:52.559
He looks different to how I imagined.

51:03.759 --> 51:07.279
Do you know this, erm, experiment.

51:07.279 --> 51:08.479
Rice.

51:08.479 --> 51:11.999
Um, animal behaviourist, 1950s, I think.

51:11.999 --> 51:13.319
Rice?

51:13.319 --> 51:14.479
Yeah.

51:14.479 --> 51:18.279
Erm, is that the one with the monkeys?

51:18.279 --> 51:19.999
Mm.

51:19.999 --> 51:21.839
What's that got to do with anything?

51:21.839 --> 51:25.839
It's just been in my head and I
don't really get to talk to anybody

51:25.839 --> 51:28.919
in here, or... not in court
for that matter, either.

51:28.919 --> 51:31.199
Have you seen the footage?

51:31.199 --> 51:32.439
Erm...

51:32.439 --> 51:35.959
I'm not sure. Erm... maybe years ago.

51:35.959 --> 51:37.839
It's the one with the
heated cage, right?

51:37.839 --> 51:38.839
Mm.

51:39.856 --> 51:41.879
Um, yeah, it's extraordinary.

51:41.879 --> 51:43.679
Really? That's not the word I'd use.

51:43.679 --> 51:45.719
Well, I mean the experiment's horrific.

51:45.719 --> 51:47.599
They wouldn't get away
with it these days.

51:47.599 --> 51:51.479
But the... the outcome's pretty
amazing. The power of maternal love.

51:51.479 --> 51:52.839
You're kidding!

51:52.839 --> 51:55.239
I... I thought the whole point
was the monkey drops the baby.

51:55.239 --> 51:59.239
No, she saves the baby. I
remember reading about it.

51:59.239 --> 52:02.039
She holds the baby in the
air and lets her feet burn.

52:04.719 --> 52:06.599
If it's the same experiment.

52:22.879 --> 52:25.319
I wish I could make you feel safe.

52:28.863 --> 52:33.639
I do. I feel safe here with you.

52:38.559 --> 52:42.999
I know you. You're not a monster...

52:46.439 --> 52:50.919
and once everyone else knows
what you are, they'll understand.

52:53.119 --> 52:56.639
Members of the jury, this witness
is to give evidence behind a screen.

52:56.639 --> 52:59.239
You'll be able to see the witness,

52:59.239 --> 53:02.279
however, the defendants
and the gallery will not.

53:02.279 --> 53:06.199
Thank you for your patience while
we make the necessary adjustments.

53:07.639 --> 53:11.799
Witness A, can you please
tell us what your job is?

53:11.799 --> 53:14.479
My title is Chief
Training Operative, MI5.

53:14.479 --> 53:18.279
And can you explain for us what a
Chief Training Operative is or does?

53:18.279 --> 53:19.639
There are various roles,

53:19.639 --> 53:22.479
but my particular responsibility
is to oversee the testing we put

53:22.479 --> 53:25.919
operatives through, both
physical and psychological.

53:25.919 --> 53:28.559
As part of the selection
process for MI5.

53:28.559 --> 53:31.319
And... how do you go about
finding out whether or not

53:31.319 --> 53:34.039
a given person is suitable
for a career in M15?

53:34.039 --> 53:37.679
I understand that the precise
methods are confidential but if you

53:37.679 --> 53:40.279
could, please give the
court a general idea.

53:40.279 --> 53:43.759
Well, we begin with, erm,
psychological questionnaires,

53:43.759 --> 53:45.159
interviews and so on.

53:45.159 --> 53:46.199
Physical tests?

53:46.199 --> 53:48.039
Well, yes, of course.

53:48.039 --> 53:50.559
Then candidates who make
the first cut move to

53:50.559 --> 53:52.799
a more extended period of training.

53:52.799 --> 53:55.999
Witness A, do you know the
defendant, Mark Costley?

53:55.999 --> 53:58.959
Yes, I met Mr Costley
in the autumn of 2008,

53:58.959 --> 54:01.079
when he applied to join
the security services.

54:01.079 --> 54:03.399
He made the "first
cut", as you would say?

54:03.399 --> 54:06.639
Yes. I was responsible for
assessing his application.

54:06.639 --> 54:09.599
Not exclusively, but I was
the supervising officer.

54:09.599 --> 54:12.359
Could you tell us a little more
about the training Mr Costley

54:12.359 --> 54:15.119
underwent, so far as
you are permitted to say?

54:15.119 --> 54:18.279
Well, candidates attend
seminars, lectures, and they also

54:18.279 --> 54:21.359
undergo a period of more what you
might call interactive training.

54:21.359 --> 54:23.439
Does this include combat training?

54:23.439 --> 54:25.399
There's a basic level
of combat training.

54:25.399 --> 54:27.959
Of course, Mr Costley had spent
some years in the police force,

54:27.959 --> 54:30.279
so he was already familiar
with some of the principles.

54:30.279 --> 54:31.679
Indeed.

54:31.679 --> 54:35.679
Would this level of training give
an individual an advantage over

54:35.679 --> 54:39.359
what you might call an
average citizen, in a fight?

54:39.359 --> 54:41.959
Well, that's rather what
it's designed to do, yes.

54:41.959 --> 54:46.639
To be clear, does combat training,
as opposed to what Mr Costley

54:46.639 --> 54:50.399
would had been taught as part of
his police officer safety training,

54:50.399 --> 54:53.479
include a technique for
breaking an assailant's nose

54:53.479 --> 54:55.279
with the palm of one's hand?

54:55.279 --> 54:58.359
That's one of the
techniques disseminated, yes.

54:58.359 --> 55:02.159
And in assessing Mark Costley,
did you find him suitable to the

55:02.159 --> 55:04.759
physical requirements of an MI5 officer?

55:04.759 --> 55:06.399
Yes, we did.

55:06.399 --> 55:09.519
During the time you were assessing
Mr Costley, did you ever feel

55:09.519 --> 55:14.799
sufficient concern about his
mental stability to raise the issue

55:14.799 --> 55:17.879
with his line manager in the
Metropolitan Police Force?

55:17.879 --> 55:20.639
His mental stability? I'm sorry,

55:20.639 --> 55:23.279
I don't quite see where
you're heading with this...

55:23.279 --> 55:25.599
I mean, it really wasn't my... role.

55:25.599 --> 55:29.199
I'm asking if you were happy enough
with Mark Costley's mental state

55:29.199 --> 55:31.679
to allow him to continue
working as a police officer,

55:31.679 --> 55:35.399
and then to move on into a
sensitive position involving the

55:35.399 --> 55:38.639
security and the safety of
our Members of Parliament,

55:38.639 --> 55:43.479
despite your final decision to
reject his application to join MI5?

55:53.479 --> 55:56.919
Yes, it was purely for me to
turn him down as an unsuitable

55:56.919 --> 55:59.079
candidate for the security services.

56:06.439 --> 56:08.119
I wasn't fucking a spook.

56:11.522 --> 56:13.202
The spooks didn't want you...

56:17.679 --> 56:20.879
All the ways you made
yourself mysterious...

56:20.879 --> 56:22.959
Facing the wrong way...

56:22.959 --> 56:24.199
Risk assessment.

56:24.199 --> 56:27.159
...the phones, the safe house...

56:32.239 --> 56:35.319
Why? I believed you.

56:36.999 --> 56:41.199
Everything about you.
Who are you... really?

56:45.919 --> 56:47.279
What have I done?
