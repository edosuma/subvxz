00:02.068 --> 00:03.184
<i>Previously on rescue me.</i>

00:03.219 --> 00:04.265
I have a situation.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.434
That place where I have Jeannie?

00:05.469 --> 00:06.434
The place in connecticut.

00:06.469 --> 00:07.400
Yeah, they just raised

00:07.435 --> 00:08.367
The monthly rent.

00:08.402 --> 00:09.384
If I need a couple

00:09.419 --> 00:10.459
Hundred bucks, I mean,

00:10.494 --> 00:11.500
Can I come to you?

00:11.535 --> 00:12.332
Sure.

00:12.367 --> 00:13.217
But you know this

00:13.252 --> 00:14.068
Girl that I've been seeing?

00:14.103 --> 00:14.799
Yeah.

00:14.834 --> 00:15.701
It's pretty serious, man.

00:15.736 --> 00:16.651
Who is she?

00:16.686 --> 00:18.110
It's Maggie.

00:18.145 --> 00:19.172
Tommy's sister?

00:19.207 --> 00:20.165
Get away from me.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.317
Can I have your cherry?

00:21.352 --> 00:22.576
If you knew me, you'd know

00:22.611 --> 00:23.801
I never put fruit in drinks.

00:23.836 --> 00:24.799
Cherries are for pies,

00:24.834 --> 00:25.734
Slot machines, and virgins.

00:25.769 --> 00:26.567
You see any of those

00:26.602 --> 00:27.165
Around here?

00:27.200 --> 00:28.432
No, I sure don't.

00:28.467 --> 00:29.167
Let me get this straight.

00:29.202 --> 00:29.867
I'm banging my science

00:29.902 --> 00:30.701
Teacher.

00:30.736 --> 00:31.451
Mrs...

00:31.486 --> 00:32.131
Turbody.

00:32.167 --> 00:32.934
Do you want to ask me

00:32.969 --> 00:33.599
Something?

00:33.634 --> 00:35.100
Quite frankly, missy,

00:35.135 --> 00:36.267
I'm pretty disgusted.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.868
I'll only discuss this

00:37.903 --> 00:39.434
Off school grounds...

00:39.469 --> 00:41.634
over drinks.

00:41.669 --> 00:42.198
Sexy.

00:42.233 --> 00:43.499
Very sexy.

00:43.534 --> 00:45.332
What a great rack.

00:45.367 --> 00:47.566
I'm leaving on Monday,

00:47.601 --> 00:49.467
Which gives us an entire weekend

00:49.502 --> 00:51.233
Full of possibilities,

00:51.268 --> 00:52.467
Doesn't it.

00:52.502 --> 00:53.198
Yeah.

00:53.233 --> 00:54.350
Who's your mom dating?

00:54.385 --> 00:55.467
I can't tell you.

00:55.502 --> 00:56.165
Uh-Huh.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.133
If I tell you, I'll be

00:57.168 --> 00:58.501
Dishonoring her,

00:58.536 --> 00:59.834
So I really can't.

Hey, kenny.

01:36.068 --> 01:37.184
Oh, jeez, you look a little

01:37.219 --> 01:38.300
Green around the gills.

01:38.335 --> 01:38.966
You ok?

01:39.001 --> 01:40.100
Yeah, I think I'm coming down

01:40.135 --> 01:40.799
With something.

01:40.834 --> 01:41.966
Bird flu, maybe.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.117
Why don't you go home,

01:43.152 --> 01:44.233
Take care of yourself,

01:44.268 --> 01:45.750
Get some rest?

01:45.785 --> 01:47.198
Home. Tempting.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.001
I think I'll tough it out.

01:49.036 --> 01:50.132
Your call.

01:50.167 --> 01:51.634
Hey, listen, is there any chance

01:51.669 --> 01:52.567
You can float me that money

01:52.602 --> 01:53.251
We talked about?

01:53.286 --> 01:53.993
I'm sorry, Jerry.

01:54.028 --> 01:54.666
I'm tapped out.

01:54.701 --> 01:55.467
Oh, shit, I thought you were

01:55.502 --> 01:56.251
Gonna help me out.

01:56.286 --> 01:57.001
Things change, man.

01:57.036 --> 01:58.201
I'm sorry.

01:58.236 --> 01:59.332
Yeah, fine.

01:59.367 --> 02:00.333
It's just that I was depending

02:00.368 --> 02:01.218
Upon that money for Jeannie's...

02:01.253 --> 02:02.410
Christ, Jerry, what do I look

02:02.445 --> 02:03.567
Like, a goddamn atm machine

02:03.602 --> 02:04.465
To you?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.601
You need track money, go to see

02:05.636 --> 02:06.566
A goddamn shylock!

02:06.601 --> 02:07.400
Hey, lower your voice,

02:07.435 --> 02:07.999
Lieutenant.

02:08.033 --> 02:08.750
I got to remind you

02:08.785 --> 02:09.442
Who you're talking to?

02:09.477 --> 02:10.065
Oh, yeah, you know,

02:10.100 --> 02:10.949
That's great, that's great.

02:10.985 --> 02:11.801
Hit me up for cash and then you

02:11.836 --> 02:13.232
Pull rank on me.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.200
You're a real class act, Chief.

02:18.034 --> 02:19.501
Morning, Chief.

02:19.536 --> 02:21.118
Hey, probie...

02:21.153 --> 02:22.577

02:22.612 --> 02:24.001
Clean that up.

Hey, slugger.

02:28.602 --> 02:29.417
Hey, Garrity.

02:29.452 --> 02:30.198
Oh, hey.

02:30.233 --> 02:30.967
What's up, man?

02:31.002 --> 02:31.666
What's going on?

02:31.701 --> 02:32.400
You out humping around

02:32.435 --> 02:33.101
Last night?

02:33.136 --> 02:33.732
What?

02:33.767 --> 02:34.399
Humping around?

02:34.434 --> 02:35.850
No, I just... I was, um,

02:35.885 --> 02:37.243
I only hump the one.

02:37.278 --> 02:38.705
You know, I just, I only

02:38.740 --> 02:40.133
Make love to, you know,

02:40.168 --> 02:40.966
The girlfriend.

02:41.001 --> 02:41.767
So you're like a one-Woman

02:41.802 --> 02:42.465
Guy now.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.867
Yeah, man. Yeah, pretty much.

02:43.902 --> 02:47.132
Pretty much.

02:47.167 --> 02:47.934
So when are we gonna meet

02:47.969 --> 02:49.165
This girlfriend?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.667
Meet her? The girlfriend?

02:50.702 --> 02:51.265
Yeah.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.333
Um, you know,

02:52.368 --> 02:53.332
She's uh, soon.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.601
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

02:54.636 --> 02:55.567
She works a lot.

02:55.602 --> 02:56.232
Uh-Huh.

02:56.267 --> 02:58.183
Yeah, yeah, so, you know.

02:58.218 --> 02:59.725
Hey, that was some brouhaha

02:59.760 --> 03:01.113
The other night, wasn't it?

03:01.148 --> 03:02.341
I mean, not ha-Ha funny,

03:02.376 --> 03:03.499
Just you know, sort of...

03:03.534 --> 03:05.500
actually it wasn't funny at all.

03:05.535 --> 03:07.467
It was really sickening kind of.

03:07.502 --> 03:08.468
Yeah, that's how we settle

03:08.503 --> 03:09.434
Things in my family, you know.

03:09.469 --> 03:11.098
We're Irish.

03:11.133 --> 03:12.467
Yeah, well, hey, please,

03:12.502 --> 03:13.068
Tell me about it.

03:13.103 --> 03:14.999
Garrity.

03:15.034 --> 03:15.800
Uh, no, I mean, like,

03:15.835 --> 03:16.768
We're real Irish.

03:16.803 --> 03:17.666
We're not like fake,

03:17.701 --> 03:19.133
Your-Generation, faggoty Irish.

03:19.168 --> 03:19.867
You know what I mean?

03:19.902 --> 03:20.532
I know you guys are like,

03:20.567 --> 03:21.601
"You know, I have my feelings,"

03:21.636 --> 03:22.434
And you talk it out.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.198
We don't talk it out.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.500
We find out who's responsible,

03:24.535 --> 03:25.584
Find the person, and then beat

03:25.619 --> 03:26.693
The living shit out of them.

03:26.728 --> 03:27.930
My grandfather's best friend

03:27.965 --> 03:28.983
Growing up, he was friends with

03:29.018 --> 03:29.993
The guy for like 40 years, and I

03:30.028 --> 03:31.364
Guess the guy was flirting with

03:31.399 --> 03:32.701
My grandmother one day, and long

03:32.736 --> 03:33.835
Story short, my grandfather

03:33.870 --> 03:34.934
Rearranged the guy's face so he

03:34.969 --> 03:36.766
Can barely talk now.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.701
Wow, what did the guy say

03:38.736 --> 03:40.285
To your grandmother?

03:40.320 --> 03:41.799
Um, good morning.

03:41.834 --> 03:42.701
Step on that for me, will you?

03:42.736 --> 03:43.299
Hey, yeah.

03:43.334 --> 03:44.001
Don't tell anybody

03:44.036 --> 03:44.532
About that.

03:44.567 --> 03:45.284
No, hey, we all make

03:45.319 --> 03:46.001
Mistakes, right?

03:46.036 --> 03:46.566
What?

03:46.601 --> 03:47.365
What's that?

03:47.400 --> 03:50.100
You say something?

03:50.135 --> 03:52.801
Yeah, I'm a dead man.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.117
* on another day,

04:00.152 --> 04:01.799
Come on, come on,

04:01.834 --> 04:03.400
With these ropes I tied,

04:03.435 --> 04:05.300
Can we do no wrong?

04:05.335 --> 04:06.532
Now we grieve

04:06.567 --> 04:08.217
'Cause now is gone,

04:08.252 --> 04:09.893
Things were good

04:09.928 --> 04:11.499
When we were young,

04:11.534 --> 04:13.068
With my teeth locked down

04:13.103 --> 04:14.701
I can see the blood

04:14.736 --> 04:16.265
Of a thousand men

04:16.300 --> 04:18.166
Who have come and gone,

04:18.202 --> 04:19.699
Now we grieve

04:19.733 --> 04:21.317
'Cause now is gone,

04:21.351 --> 04:22.843
Things were good

04:22.878 --> 04:24.439
When we were young,

04:24.474 --> 04:26.054
Is it safe to say?

04:26.089 --> 04:27.599
Come on, come on,

04:27.634 --> 04:29.300
Was it right to leave?

04:29.335 --> 04:30.951
Come on, come on,

04:30.986 --> 04:32.626
Will I ever learn?

04:32.661 --> 04:34.247
Come on, come on,

[Captioning made possible

By Sony pictures television]

04:53.034 --> 04:54.617
I brought you some food

04:54.652 --> 04:56.200
Because you've been working

04:56.235 --> 04:58.265
So hard.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.250
Yeah, well, after what you

04:59.285 --> 05:00.342
Just did to me, I think what I

05:00.377 --> 05:01.365
Really need is a handful of

05:01.400 --> 05:03.050
Aspirin and a shot of vitamin a.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.701
No, just come lie down again.

05:04.736 --> 05:05.500
I'll make it all better,

05:05.535 --> 05:06.432
I promise.

05:06.467 --> 05:07.833
Yeah, that worked

05:07.868 --> 05:09.000
The first 2 times.

05:09.035 --> 05:10.051
What time is it?

05:10.086 --> 05:11.033
About 7:00.

05:11.068 --> 05:12.467
Yeah, I need to bounce.

05:12.502 --> 05:13.801
My kid's waiting on me.

05:13.836 --> 05:15.100
Excuse me? You have a kid?

05:15.135 --> 05:16.601
Yep, a daughter.

05:16.636 --> 05:18.068
What's her name?

05:18.103 --> 05:19.952
Keela. She's 6.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.766
Ohh. Her mom?

05:21.801 --> 05:23.600
Her mom's dead actually.

05:23.635 --> 05:25.400
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

05:25.435 --> 05:26.134
Ah, don't be.

05:26.169 --> 05:26.799
We didn't really

05:26.834 --> 05:27.634
Know each other, you know?

05:27.669 --> 05:28.467
Keela kind of just,

05:28.502 --> 05:30.468
Uh, happened.

05:30.503 --> 05:32.434
I'll see you.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.866
You know what?

05:38.901 --> 05:40.801
It's not gonna work, you know.

05:40.836 --> 05:43.065
What?

05:43.100 --> 05:44.584
Your ploy.

05:44.619 --> 05:46.033
My ploy?

05:46.068 --> 05:48.132
Your ploy that you use with

05:48.167 --> 05:49.467
All of your conquests, you know,

05:49.502 --> 05:50.351
When you get them to bed,

05:50.386 --> 05:51.493
Then you tell them that you

05:51.528 --> 05:53.064
Have a kid, and they get scared

05:53.099 --> 05:55.816
And run screaming for the hills,

05:55.851 --> 05:57.876
And then you get off scot-Free.

05:57.911 --> 05:59.901
'Cause I happen to love kids.

05:59.936 --> 06:01.666
Mm.

06:01.701 --> 06:02.367
Maybe I could meet her

06:02.402 --> 06:04.499
Sometime.

06:04.534 --> 06:07.434
Yeah, I, uh, l... I don't know.

06:07.469 --> 06:09.499
Oh, come on.

06:09.534 --> 06:10.901
We could do something fun,

06:10.936 --> 06:13.185
Just the 3 of us.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.399
And I'll treat.

06:15.434 --> 06:17.833
And then afterwards we could do

06:17.868 --> 06:20.233
Something fun, just the 2 of us.

06:20.268 --> 06:22.168
Mm.

06:22.203 --> 06:24.033
Mm.

06:24.068 --> 06:25.267
I'll call you.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.767
Mm-Hmm.

06:30.034 --> 06:31.601
Nice crib, by the way.

06:31.636 --> 06:33.285
Thanks.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.934
Thank you.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.000
You got a hole the size of

06:40.035 --> 06:41.901
A nickel in your brown shoes.

06:41.936 --> 06:43.732
Still got my black ones.

06:43.767 --> 06:44.900
A man should have 2 pairs of shoes

06:44.935 --> 06:46.034
One for getting around

06:46.069 --> 06:47.618
And one for going out.

06:47.653 --> 06:49.167
Not that we do that

06:49.202 --> 06:50.432
Much anymore.

06:50.467 --> 06:51.165
We should go tomorrow

06:51.200 --> 06:52.300
Morning and get a new pair.

06:52.335 --> 06:53.399
I can't.

06:53.434 --> 06:55.866
Listen, Jerry, if visiting

06:55.901 --> 06:57.133
Jeannie has made you have doubts

06:57.168 --> 06:59.133
About us, our friendship,

06:59.168 --> 06:59.866
I'll understand.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.934
Just please be honest with me.

07:01.969 --> 07:03.968
We're not doing anything wrong,

07:04.003 --> 07:04.732
You know.

07:04.767 --> 07:05.866
It's not that.

07:05.901 --> 07:07.467
I got to go and see her brother.

07:07.502 --> 07:08.233
I thought bud lived in

07:08.268 --> 07:09.566
Arizona.

07:09.601 --> 07:12.033
Not for a long time.

07:12.068 --> 07:13.301
He moved back into the area,

07:13.336 --> 07:14.534
Opened up a car dealership

07:14.569 --> 07:16.866
A few years ago.

07:16.901 --> 07:17.934
Never even bothered to contact

07:17.969 --> 07:18.968
Her after they had this big

07:19.003 --> 07:20.632
Falling out.

07:20.667 --> 07:21.434
Must have been some

07:21.469 --> 07:22.198
Falling out.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.767
What was it about?

07:23.802 --> 07:26.033
It was me.

07:26.068 --> 07:27.167
Still she keeps on asking

07:27.202 --> 07:28.065
About him.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.550
I guess she's got

07:29.585 --> 07:30.966
A right to know.

07:31.001 --> 07:31.901
I'll pick out something

07:31.936 --> 07:33.233
Nice for you.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.065
How's the wine?

07:39.100 --> 07:40.267
I'm guessing they opened this

07:40.302 --> 07:41.799
Bottle around '88.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.134
Yeah, well, they don't get

07:43.169 --> 07:44.434
A very sophisticated clientele

07:44.469 --> 07:46.001
In this joint.

07:46.036 --> 07:47.668
Sorry, no offense.

07:47.703 --> 07:49.300
Yeah, up your ass.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.232
Thanks.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.333
Maybe we should go someplace

07:52.368 --> 07:53.400
Where we can really talk.

07:53.435 --> 07:54.165
Ok, listen.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.450
Your nephew and I, we have

07:55.485 --> 07:56.701
A very special, intimate

07:56.736 --> 07:58.299
Relationship.

07:58.334 --> 07:59.634
He got an "a" on his biology

07:59.669 --> 08:01.132
Quiz, by the way.

08:01.167 --> 08:02.899
Look, y-You got to, you got

08:02.934 --> 08:05.134
To put an end to this thing, ok?

08:05.169 --> 08:06.818
'Cause the mother hen, if you

08:06.853 --> 08:08.643
Know what I'm talking about,

08:08.678 --> 08:10.106
Is getting very curious.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.654
Why do you think I canceled

08:12.689 --> 08:15.178
Our parent/teacher meeting?

08:15.213 --> 08:17.667
So you're thinking of ending

08:17.702 --> 08:18.699
It then.

08:18.734 --> 08:20.968
I care deeply for...

08:21.003 --> 08:22.033
you-Know-Who.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.251
The point is, if you get

08:23.286 --> 08:24.526
Caught doing you-Know-What

08:24.561 --> 08:26.781
With you-Know-Who, I'm telling

08:26.816 --> 08:29.001
You, some really serious stuff

08:29.036 --> 08:29.767
Is gonna happen.

08:29.802 --> 08:30.465
Stuff?

08:30.500 --> 08:32.350
Stuff. Big, scary stuff.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.200
Ok? You got to put an end

08:34.235 --> 08:35.832
To this thing.

08:35.866 --> 08:38.317
Well, if I end that thing,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.710
I'm gonna need another thing

08:40.745 --> 08:43.068
To take that thing's place.

08:46.133 --> 08:47.017
I'm a little confused.

08:47.052 --> 08:47.901
There were like 3 things

08:47.936 --> 08:48.599
In there.

08:48.634 --> 08:49.767
Which, which thing are we

08:49.802 --> 08:50.968
Talking about?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.666
My thing?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.265
Hey, ma, I got a...

08:58.300 --> 09:01.901
yeah, I had a tuna sandwich.

09:01.936 --> 09:03.999
It was good.

09:04.034 --> 09:05.367
Yeah, I'm ok, I guess.

09:05.402 --> 09:06.468
Listen, I got a quick

09:06.503 --> 09:09.435
Question for you.

09:09.470 --> 09:12.332
Um... how old am I?

09:12.367 --> 09:13.667
No, I know the year I was born

09:13.702 --> 09:15.467
In, but I was counting backwards

09:15.502 --> 09:17.034
From 2006 to remember how old,

09:17.069 --> 09:18.568
And since I was born in december

09:18.603 --> 09:20.252
And there was the whole year

09:20.287 --> 09:21.901
2000 thing and I think like

09:21.936 --> 09:23.768
A leap year in there,

09:23.803 --> 09:25.252
I got confused is all.

09:25.287 --> 09:26.666
Because I'm filling out

09:26.701 --> 09:28.000
A transfer form, and I'd look

09:28.035 --> 09:29.351
Pretty stupid if I got it wrong.

09:29.386 --> 09:30.667
Can you just tell me how old

09:30.702 --> 09:33.618
Please?

09:33.653 --> 09:36.499
Oh, oh.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.033
Glad I called then.

09:39.068 --> 09:40.500
All right, I better get back

09:40.535 --> 09:43.101
To this form.

09:43.136 --> 09:45.667
Love you too.

09:46.767 --> 09:48.267
This is so wrong.

09:48.302 --> 09:49.265
How many ways?

09:49.300 --> 09:50.233
Yeah, that's why it feels

09:50.268 --> 09:50.917
So right.

09:50.952 --> 09:51.626
Really?

09:51.661 --> 09:52.265
Mm-Hmm.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.433
I just feel so guilty.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.567
That's because you're

09:54.602 --> 09:55.018
A bad boy.

09:55.053 --> 09:55.560
Oh, yeah?

09:55.595 --> 09:56.033
Uh-Huh.

09:56.068 --> 09:57.134
Oh, my God.

09:57.169 --> 09:58.318
Ohh. Ohh.

09:58.353 --> 09:59.467
Say my name.

09:59.502 --> 10:00.267
Nell?

10:00.968 --> 10:02.284
Not nell, stupid.

10:02.319 --> 10:03.601
Call me Mrs. Turbody.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.868
Mrs. Turbody.

10:05.903 --> 10:08.100
Yes! Oh, yes!

10:16.167 --> 10:17.999
Sorry.

10:18.034 --> 10:18.632
Hey, yo, g,

10:18.667 --> 10:20.000
You got the time, b?

10:20.035 --> 10:21.334
Quarter past 10:00.

10:21.369 --> 10:22.033
Ah.

10:22.068 --> 10:22.834
You gonna dial up that

10:22.869 --> 10:23.601
Booty call, or what?

10:23.636 --> 10:24.532
Uh...

10:24.567 --> 10:25.233
tell her to bring us

10:25.268 --> 10:25.899
Some friends.

10:25.934 --> 10:26.666
Yeah, if they let 'em out

10:26.701 --> 10:27.500
Of the nursing home this late.

10:27.535 --> 10:28.299
Ha ha.

10:28.334 --> 10:29.667
Hey, I got to check on

10:29.702 --> 10:31.001
My daughter, jerkoffs.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.365
Oh, man.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.367
Yo, this ain't

10:35.402 --> 10:36.317
The men's room, b.

10:36.352 --> 10:37.198
What are you doing?

10:37.233 --> 10:37.983
You want to mess with me?

10:38.018 --> 10:38.699
You better put your dick

10:38.734 --> 10:39.734
Away, dude, before a rat jumps

10:39.769 --> 10:40.966
Out and bites it off.

10:41.001 --> 10:42.100
Hold on for a second, baby.

10:42.135 --> 10:42.699
Piss on you.

10:42.734 --> 10:43.599
You can go to hell.

10:43.634 --> 10:44.534
What, are you gonna mess

10:44.569 --> 10:45.065
With me too?

10:45.100 --> 10:45.901
Is that how you want it?

10:45.936 --> 10:46.801
To take a piss?

10:46.836 --> 10:47.632
Huh? Do you?

10:47.667 --> 10:50.300
Piss wherever I want!

10:50.335 --> 10:52.934
You heard me. Yeah.

10:52.969 --> 10:54.335
He's wasted.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.701
Yeah, he is.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.532
Uh, keela, honey,

11:04.567 --> 11:06.667
Daddy's got to go, all right?

11:06.702 --> 11:07.532
Bye.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.966
Sorry, I just...

11:10.001 --> 11:12.400
you're just so attractive,

11:12.435 --> 11:14.866
I just...

11:14.901 --> 11:16.484
I mean, I knew you were hot,

11:16.519 --> 11:18.068
But once I like got my hands

11:18.103 --> 11:18.701
On you, I just...

11:18.736 --> 11:20.966
I know.

11:21.001 --> 11:22.634
Listen, I'm gonna need you to go

11:22.669 --> 11:24.267
Again once I'm done with this

11:24.302 --> 11:26.034
Cigarette.

11:26.069 --> 11:28.084
Really?

11:28.119 --> 11:30.065
Oh, yeah.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.067
You're gonna fill in for your

11:31.102 --> 11:32.034
Nephew, you better raise your

11:32.069 --> 11:33.632
Game.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.001
Damian can go 3, 4 times

11:35.036 --> 11:36.634
In an hour.

11:39.567 --> 11:41.467
You keep up the pace or not?

11:44.334 --> 11:45.500
Well, l... I might need

11:45.535 --> 11:46.968
A sandwich...

11:49.068 --> 11:50.300
Mrs. Turbody.

11:58.967 --> 12:01.299
Hey.

12:01.334 --> 12:03.066
What's the matter?

12:03.101 --> 12:04.034
You don't think I'm pretty

12:04.069 --> 12:05.368
Anymore?

12:06.633 --> 12:08.067
Come here.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.167
You sleep ok?

12:16.202 --> 12:17.434
No.

12:21.368 --> 12:22.166
You know that stuff

12:22.201 --> 12:23.684
That happened last night

12:23.719 --> 12:25.493
Between your dad and me?

12:25.528 --> 12:27.267
That was just stupid brother

12:27.302 --> 12:28.299
Stuff.

12:28.334 --> 12:29.734
Me and Connor never fought

12:29.769 --> 12:30.932
Like that.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.317
Well, it's different

12:32.352 --> 12:33.632
Between two boys,

12:33.667 --> 12:35.317
Especially two grown-Up boys.

12:35.352 --> 12:36.967
We can be a real dopey bunch

12:37.002 --> 12:39.084
Sometimes.

12:39.119 --> 12:40.893
It was scary.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.667
Look, um...

12:45.101 --> 12:48.334
your dad was very, very angry

12:48.369 --> 12:51.532
With me last night, and he

12:51.567 --> 12:53.467
Probably had every right to be,

12:53.502 --> 12:55.985
And if he hadn't reacted the way

12:56.020 --> 12:58.468
That he reacted, I'd, you know,

12:58.503 --> 12:59.468
Definitely think there was

12:59.503 --> 13:00.434
Something seriously wrong

13:00.469 --> 13:01.598
With him.

13:01.633 --> 13:04.066
Katy, look at me.

13:04.101 --> 13:06.034
There's nothing, nothing

13:06.069 --> 13:07.565
To be scared of.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.434
He's still your dad, you know,

13:10.469 --> 13:12.767
And he loves you very,

13:12.802 --> 13:14.132
Very much.

13:14.167 --> 13:17.368
You love us too, right?

13:17.403 --> 13:19.167
Yeah.

13:23.201 --> 13:25.784
<i>What do you want, Jerry?</i>

13:25.819 --> 13:28.368
Hey, bud, we need to talk.

13:28.403 --> 13:29.765
Piss off.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.600
Your sister Jeannie,

13:31.635 --> 13:33.066
She's sick.

13:33.101 --> 13:34.767
She's got alzheimer's, bud.

13:34.802 --> 13:36.434
If she's sick, she's sick.

13:36.469 --> 13:37.301
There's nothing I can

13:37.336 --> 13:38.099
Do for her.

13:38.134 --> 13:39.484
Actually there might be.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.143
The facility where she's

13:41.178 --> 13:42.767
Staying, she really loves it

13:42.802 --> 13:44.032
There.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.134
It makes the disease easier.

13:46.169 --> 13:48.201
They really care for her there.

13:48.236 --> 13:50.299
Good for her.

13:50.334 --> 13:53.250
Get out of my showroom.

13:53.285 --> 13:56.132
She talks about you.

13:56.167 --> 13:58.617
I don't understand it, but she

13:58.652 --> 14:00.776
Keeps on calling your name.

14:00.811 --> 14:02.900
I can't cover the nut, bud.

14:02.935 --> 14:04.701
I need your help.

14:04.736 --> 14:06.301
I'm on my knees here.

14:06.336 --> 14:07.832
Then stand up and get

14:07.867 --> 14:09.134
Yourself a job before they toss

14:09.169 --> 14:11.066
Her out on the street.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.167
Now get out of here unless you

14:12.202 --> 14:13.917
Want to buy one of these,

14:13.952 --> 14:15.633
Which I seriously doubt.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.366
Hey.

14:32.401 --> 14:33.317
What you eating?

14:33.352 --> 14:34.209
Nicotine gum.

14:34.244 --> 14:35.155
Tastes like shit.

14:35.190 --> 14:36.032
You quit smoking?

14:36.067 --> 14:38.201
No, I'm atoning for my sins.

14:38.236 --> 14:39.232
Hey, your dad called.

14:39.267 --> 14:40.399
Said you did a jig on your

14:40.434 --> 14:41.500
Brother's head the other night.

14:41.535 --> 14:42.934
Yeah. He tell you why?

14:42.969 --> 14:43.918
Shakespearian.

14:43.953 --> 14:45.010
Yeah, I know.

14:45.045 --> 14:46.067
Scorsese-Esque.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.132
Yeah.

14:47.167 --> 14:48.500
Hey, I also hear you're no

14:48.535 --> 14:49.834
Closer to having a male heir.

14:51.201 --> 14:51.900
I've been a little busy,

14:51.935 --> 14:52.665
You know.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.750
Well, what if you get

14:53.785 --> 14:54.765
Barbecued on the job

14:54.800 --> 14:55.834
Or Johnny comes by and puts one

14:55.869 --> 14:56.865
In your belly?

14:56.900 --> 14:58.050
I mean, who's gonna carry on

14:58.085 --> 14:59.201
The family name? The tradition?

14:59.236 --> 15:00.151
I know, I know, I know.

15:00.186 --> 15:01.067
The old man's gonna

15:01.102 --> 15:02.632
Go soon, Tom.

15:02.667 --> 15:03.850
Now's the perfect time to think

15:03.885 --> 15:04.909
About going to a sperm bank

15:04.944 --> 15:05.934
And having some of your boys

15:05.969 --> 15:06.665
Put on ice.

15:06.700 --> 15:07.450
I'm not going

15:07.485 --> 15:08.201
To a sperm bank.

15:08.236 --> 15:08.865
Why not?

15:08.900 --> 15:09.899
It makes perfect sense.

15:09.934 --> 15:11.350
That way if something happens

15:11.385 --> 15:12.732
To you, you got insurance

15:12.767 --> 15:13.884
And your dad can rest peacefully

15:13.919 --> 15:15.001
Knowing the gavins have a shot

15:15.036 --> 15:15.699
To carry on.

15:15.734 --> 15:16.533
Yeah, yeah, long live

15:16.568 --> 15:17.232
The gavins.

15:17.267 --> 15:18.167
Amen to that, brother.

15:18.202 --> 15:19.199
Yeah.

15:19.234 --> 15:20.301
Hey, I don't know if cousin

15:20.336 --> 15:21.368
Eddie told you, but you know,

15:21.403 --> 15:22.167
These mothers against

15:22.202 --> 15:22.734
Drunk driving...

15:22.769 --> 15:23.498
yeah?

15:23.533 --> 15:24.383
They got a petition going

15:24.418 --> 15:25.242
With like 600 names on it

15:25.277 --> 15:26.072
That they're gonna present

15:26.107 --> 15:26.867
To the court to try to get you

15:26.902 --> 15:27.734
Sprung early, you know?

15:27.769 --> 15:28.751
You're shitting me.

15:28.786 --> 15:30.127
No. Isn't that great?

15:30.162 --> 15:31.433
No! It's terrible!

15:31.468 --> 15:32.751
I've grown to love it here.

15:32.786 --> 15:34.159
Last week my cellmate got this

15:34.194 --> 15:35.533
Fabulous recipe for toilet wine

15:35.568 --> 15:36.700
From his homeys in chino.

15:36.735 --> 15:37.565
So write it down.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.633
When you get sprung, you can

15:38.668 --> 15:39.934
Make it in your own shitter.

15:39.969 --> 15:41.101
I don't think you understand.

15:41.136 --> 15:42.234
Taking out a drunk driver who

15:42.269 --> 15:43.565
Killed a kid?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.134
I'm like a celebrity inside.

15:45.169 --> 15:46.132
I'm a king in here.

15:46.167 --> 15:47.684
So let me get this straight.

15:47.719 --> 15:49.201
You don't want your freedom.

15:49.236 --> 15:50.151
No, and I want it

15:50.186 --> 15:50.993
To stay that way.

15:51.028 --> 15:52.114
You know, I'm getting

15:52.149 --> 15:53.166
Marriage proposals?

15:53.201 --> 15:54.900
I got a stack of mail in my cell

15:54.935 --> 15:55.865
6 feet tall.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.117
I'm serious about this, Tom.

15:57.152 --> 15:58.334
Ok, what do you want me

15:58.369 --> 15:59.051
To tell them?

15:59.086 --> 15:59.699
I don't know.

15:59.734 --> 16:01.001
Tell them it's a lovely gesture,

16:01.036 --> 16:02.232
But find another cause.

16:02.267 --> 16:04.000
Take up bridge, or better yet,

16:04.035 --> 16:05.734
Get laid and have a drink.

16:05.769 --> 16:06.700
All right.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.017
Listen, on a more personal note,

16:11.052 --> 16:13.667
Dad's not doing great, you know?

16:13.702 --> 16:14.667
He's pissing the bed like

16:14.702 --> 16:15.333
Twice a week.

16:15.368 --> 16:16.266
He's forgetting stuff.

16:16.301 --> 16:17.800
He's really turning into a pain

16:17.835 --> 16:19.584
In the ass, and I just...

16:19.619 --> 16:21.334
I wanted to talk to you about

16:21.369 --> 16:23.051
What... what you think.

16:23.086 --> 16:24.510
I'm thinking maybe I should

16:24.545 --> 16:25.934
Start looking at nursing homes.

16:25.969 --> 16:27.251
You listen to me, kid.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.533
Don't you ever mention

16:28.568 --> 16:29.099
That again.

16:29.134 --> 16:30.067
Don't you ever even think

16:30.102 --> 16:30.932
Of that again!

16:30.967 --> 16:32.234
'Cause if you do, you won't have

16:32.269 --> 16:33.201
To worry about the mothers

16:33.236 --> 16:34.118
Of drunk driving

16:34.153 --> 16:34.966
Getting me out.

16:35.001 --> 16:36.001
I'll chew through these walls,

16:36.036 --> 16:37.434
And I'll kill you myself!

16:37.469 --> 16:40.032
You got that?

16:40.067 --> 16:41.667
I got to go to lunch.

16:41.702 --> 16:43.085
They're serving

16:43.120 --> 16:44.468
Sloppy joes today.

16:49.934 --> 16:51.500
Here's your coffees.

16:51.535 --> 16:52.634
Thanks.

16:52.669 --> 16:53.699
Mm-Hmm.

16:53.734 --> 16:54.468
Figure out what you want

16:54.503 --> 16:55.768
Yet, sweetie?

16:55.803 --> 16:56.999
Thank you.

16:57.034 --> 16:58.865
It's hard, I know.

16:58.900 --> 16:59.867
If it's ok with your parents,

16:59.902 --> 17:01.551
Maybe you can pick

17:01.586 --> 17:03.166
Something out.

17:03.201 --> 17:03.934
It's ok, sweetheart.

17:03.969 --> 17:05.434
Go ahead.

17:06.334 --> 17:07.132
That made you really

17:07.166 --> 17:07.934
Uncomfortable, didn't it?

17:07.969 --> 17:08.699
What?

17:08.733 --> 17:09.567
The "parents."

17:09.602 --> 17:10.165
Nah.

17:10.201 --> 17:11.598
Nah. Nah.

17:11.633 --> 17:12.468
You know, she really loves

17:12.502 --> 17:13.132
This tea set.

17:13.166 --> 17:13.983
You didn't have to do that.

17:14.018 --> 17:14.765
What, are you kidding?

17:14.800 --> 17:15.633
I've been trying to get my hands

17:15.667 --> 17:17.633
On that tea set forever.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.050
She's a great kid.

17:19.086 --> 17:20.398
Yeah, she is.

17:20.434 --> 17:21.101
You never wanted one

17:21.136 --> 17:21.732
Of your own?

17:21.767 --> 17:22.584
I never could have

17:22.618 --> 17:23.401
One of my own.

17:23.435 --> 17:24.531
Oh.

17:24.567 --> 17:25.900
And considering how my last 3

17:25.935 --> 17:27.384
Marriages ended, it probably is

17:27.419 --> 17:28.843
The best thing that I didn't.

17:28.878 --> 17:30.267
Well, that's, uh, some track

17:30.302 --> 17:31.034
Record you got there.

17:31.069 --> 17:31.899
Yeah, it is.

17:31.934 --> 17:32.733
Still, you seem to have

17:32.768 --> 17:33.533
A knack for the motherhood

17:33.568 --> 17:34.199
Thing.

17:34.234 --> 17:35.232
I have a lot of nieces

17:35.267 --> 17:36.483
And nephews, and I spoil them.

17:36.518 --> 17:37.700
My sister hates me for it.

17:37.735 --> 17:38.266
Not the kids?

17:38.301 --> 17:39.498
No, not the kids.

17:39.533 --> 17:40.533
What do you say, sweetheart?

17:40.568 --> 17:41.232
Thank you.

17:41.267 --> 17:42.367
You're welcome.

17:42.402 --> 17:43.433
Thank you.

17:43.468 --> 17:45.050
And, well, I have a little

17:45.085 --> 17:47.426
Something for you too.

17:47.461 --> 17:49.767
It's not a tea set, but...

17:49.802 --> 17:50.968
alicia...

17:51.003 --> 17:52.134
oh...

17:54.934 --> 17:56.433
oh, man.

17:56.468 --> 17:58.932
Wow.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.567
Uh, I can't accept this, alicia.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.734
Ok, but just try it on.

18:02.769 --> 18:03.867
It's pretty, daddy.

18:03.902 --> 18:04.601
Try it on.

18:04.636 --> 18:05.266
Yeah, daddy.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.317
It's pretty. Try it on.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.334
All right, all right.

18:07.369 --> 18:10.099
Jeez.

18:10.134 --> 18:11.834
That is pretty dope.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.468
What do you say, daddy?

18:17.503 --> 18:18.966
Thank you.

18:19.001 --> 18:20.434
You're welcome.

18:27.834 --> 18:28.567
Hey.

18:29.767 --> 18:30.950
Hi, Tom. Hey.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.134
How are you, man?

18:32.169 --> 18:33.066
Good.

18:33.101 --> 18:33.865
I just... I can't seem

18:33.900 --> 18:35.467
To kick the habit, you know?

18:35.502 --> 18:37.034
I'm down like 300 bones.

18:37.069 --> 18:37.768
Those things are

18:37.803 --> 18:38.468
Gonna kill ya.

18:38.503 --> 18:41.465
Yeah.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.600
Could be the stress.

18:43.635 --> 18:45.665
Yeah, yeah, could be,

18:45.700 --> 18:47.867
If I were under any stress.

18:54.034 --> 18:55.700
Listen, I better go suit up.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.217
I'll see you in a,

18:57.252 --> 18:58.426
In a little while?

18:58.461 --> 18:59.781
How long, you think?

18:59.816 --> 19:01.101
Oh, I don't know.

19:01.136 --> 19:02.399
A bit maybe?

19:02.434 --> 19:04.834
So like, what? 5 minutes?

19:04.869 --> 19:06.101
Yeah, 10 maybe.

19:15.101 --> 19:16.267
Hey, Lou.

19:16.302 --> 19:17.434
Franco.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.498
Doing ok?

19:21.533 --> 19:23.334
Another day in paradise.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.934
What are you doing out here?

19:39.969 --> 19:41.899
Me?

19:41.934 --> 19:43.000
I don't have time

19:43.035 --> 19:44.367
For games, probie.

19:44.402 --> 19:46.017
You want something?

19:46.052 --> 19:47.633
No, Chief, sure don't.

19:47.668 --> 19:49.100
Ah, then get out

19:49.135 --> 19:50.533
Of my way, goon-Boy.

19:59.967 --> 20:00.833
Hey, seano.

20:00.868 --> 20:01.665
Hey, frankie.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.467
Yo, man, you ever sneeze

20:02.502 --> 20:03.251
While you're pissing?

20:03.286 --> 20:04.076
I hate that shit.

20:04.111 --> 20:04.832
Goes everywhere.

20:04.867 --> 20:06.250
You know, whenever I'm gonna

20:06.285 --> 20:07.359
Sneeze, I look up at a light.

20:07.394 --> 20:08.330
Yeah, but you're gonna take

20:08.365 --> 20:09.232
Your eyes off the target,

20:09.267 --> 20:10.067
You might as well just go ahead

20:10.102 --> 20:10.799
And sneeze, right?

20:10.834 --> 20:11.633
Oh, yeah, I guess it's kind

20:11.668 --> 20:13.532
Of a catch-22.

20:13.567 --> 20:14.967
Yeah, not really, but I see

20:15.002 --> 20:16.434
What you're trying to get at.

20:16.469 --> 20:17.867
You talk to t. About Maggie yet?

20:17.902 --> 20:18.699
No, God, no.

20:18.734 --> 20:19.600
I was waiting for the right

20:19.635 --> 20:20.299
Time, you know.

20:20.334 --> 20:21.132
He seems a little raw

20:21.167 --> 20:22.533
After the whole Johnny thing.

20:22.568 --> 20:23.667
He seems fine to me.

20:23.702 --> 20:24.232
Really?

20:24.267 --> 20:25.301
Yeah, we been bullshitting,

20:25.336 --> 20:26.484
Laughing like normal.

20:26.519 --> 20:27.598
Really? Yeah, but he was

20:27.633 --> 20:29.000
Doing this whole bristling thing

20:29.035 --> 20:30.201
The other day, and then he just,

20:30.236 --> 20:31.368
In the kitchen he just threw me

20:31.403 --> 20:32.501
This really weird vibe.

20:32.536 --> 20:33.600
Kind of freaked me out.

20:33.635 --> 20:34.434
He was bristling?

20:34.469 --> 20:35.498
Yeah.

20:35.533 --> 20:36.532
He knows.

20:36.567 --> 20:37.567
Shit. Really? You think?

20:37.602 --> 20:38.651
Well, you said he was

20:38.686 --> 20:39.609
Bristling, right?

20:39.644 --> 20:40.498
Yeah, or, you know,

20:40.533 --> 20:41.368
I don't know, he could have

20:41.403 --> 20:42.865
Been stewing.

20:42.900 --> 20:43.567
Well, Sean, there's

20:43.602 --> 20:44.199
A difference.

20:44.234 --> 20:44.917
If he was bristling,

20:44.952 --> 20:45.643
He definitely knows.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.299
If he was stewing,

20:46.334 --> 20:47.334
It's up for grabs, you know?

20:47.369 --> 20:48.232
Shit.

20:48.267 --> 20:49.100
You know, maybe he's just

20:49.135 --> 20:50.001
Waiting for the right moment

20:50.036 --> 20:50.867
To bash your face in or set you

20:50.902 --> 20:51.635
On fire.

20:51.670 --> 20:52.333
No, no.

20:52.368 --> 20:53.132
I've been too careful.

20:53.167 --> 20:53.967
There's no way that he knows.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.199
Ah, Sean, no offense,

20:55.234 --> 20:56.484
But being careful for you is

20:56.519 --> 20:57.734
Like tempting fate for most

20:57.769 --> 20:58.498
People.

20:58.533 --> 20:59.633
Now, I seriously suggest you

20:59.668 --> 21:00.717
Consider coming clean, taking

21:00.752 --> 21:01.732
Your medicine like a man.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.001
If he finds out before you do,

21:03.036 --> 21:03.834
Just gonna make things

21:03.869 --> 21:05.318
That much worse.

21:05.353 --> 21:06.767
Think about it.

21:10.567 --> 21:12.134
We totally can

21:12.169 --> 21:14.068
Work this out.

21:14.103 --> 21:15.932
No, we can.

21:15.967 --> 21:17.800
That's not fair though!

21:18.533 --> 21:20.099
Ooh!

21:20.134 --> 21:22.932
Mmm. Mm-Mm.

21:22.967 --> 21:24.517
What are you doing?

21:24.552 --> 21:25.843
Just straightening up.

21:25.878 --> 21:27.072
Look... bothers me

21:27.107 --> 21:28.267
Not straight thing.

21:28.302 --> 21:29.099
Crazy.

21:29.134 --> 21:30.333
Hey, where are you going?

21:30.368 --> 21:31.533
You heard of school?

21:31.568 --> 21:33.465
Oh.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.217
'K, I'm just gonna clean up

21:35.252 --> 21:36.934
The house a little bit.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.734
I knew I'd find

21:40.769 --> 21:41.932
You 2 together.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.400
If I hadn't, elsa, I might

21:43.435 --> 21:44.834
Have gone on playing it

21:44.869 --> 21:46.199
Your way.

21:46.234 --> 21:47.132
You didn't know.

21:47.167 --> 21:48.234
Hey, t-Bone, what's up, man?

21:48.269 --> 21:49.285
Frankenstein.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.301
What's going on?

21:50.336 --> 21:52.199
Not much.

21:52.234 --> 21:53.200
What you been up to?

21:53.235 --> 21:54.584
Ah, I just got myself

21:54.619 --> 21:55.876
Into a bad situation

21:55.911 --> 21:57.099
Pussy-Wise, man.

21:57.134 --> 21:58.700
Is there such a thing?

21:58.735 --> 21:59.901
Yeah, um, listen, man,

21:59.936 --> 22:01.067
I think we need to talk

22:01.102 --> 22:01.632
About Lou.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.150
You notice anything

22:03.185 --> 22:04.726
Funny about him lately?

22:04.761 --> 22:06.464
Lou's a funny guy. What?

22:06.499 --> 22:07.716
Yeah, he's hilarious.

22:07.751 --> 22:08.934
Thing is, I saw him out

22:08.969 --> 22:09.701
The other night.

22:09.736 --> 22:10.399
He was hammered.

22:10.434 --> 22:11.667
You know, I'm talking

22:11.702 --> 22:12.868
Shit-Your-Pants drunk.

22:12.903 --> 22:14.034
I saw him this morning.

22:14.069 --> 22:14.818
He made no mention

22:14.853 --> 22:15.943
Of it whatsoever.

22:15.978 --> 22:16.989
So what, you think

22:17.024 --> 22:17.966
He blacked out?

22:18.001 --> 22:19.017
Yeah, it's possible.

22:19.052 --> 22:19.893
Or he didn't see me

22:19.928 --> 22:20.664
Or he didn't want

22:20.699 --> 22:21.866
To talk about it.

22:21.901 --> 22:22.767
Not to me anyway.

22:22.802 --> 22:23.598
I don't know.

22:23.633 --> 22:24.434
I just thought maybe you should

22:24.469 --> 22:25.066
Say something, you know?

22:25.101 --> 22:26.900
I think the guy's hurting, man.

22:26.935 --> 22:27.598
I don't know, man.

22:27.633 --> 22:29.483
Lou's a kind of sort-Your-

22:29.518 --> 22:31.726
Own-Laundry type of guy,

22:31.761 --> 22:33.934
But, uh, I appreciate

22:33.969 --> 22:34.934
The heads-Up.

22:35.667 --> 22:36.484
I just thought you should

22:36.519 --> 22:37.301
Be aware of the situation.

22:37.336 --> 22:38.235
I have...

22:38.270 --> 22:39.735
privacy.

22:39.770 --> 22:41.201
Yeah.

22:43.767 --> 22:44.699
Mrs. Turbody.

22:44.734 --> 22:46.284
How you feeling, Tommy?

22:46.319 --> 22:47.726
Uh, I'm, I'm good.

22:47.761 --> 22:49.099
How are, how are you?

22:49.134 --> 22:50.150
Well, I'm calling to thank

22:50.185 --> 22:51.167
You again for the other night.

22:51.202 --> 22:52.518
You certainly rose

22:52.553 --> 22:53.799
To the occasion.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.767
Thank you for the sandwich.

22:55.802 --> 22:57.034
I spoke to Damian.

22:57.069 --> 22:57.668
It's over.

22:57.703 --> 22:58.232
How did he...

22:58.267 --> 22:59.633
how did he take it?

22:59.668 --> 23:00.633
Like a boy.

23:00.668 --> 23:01.865
Shit.

23:01.900 --> 23:02.767
Nah, he's resilient.

23:02.802 --> 23:05.266
He'll survive.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.701
The question is, will you?

23:07.736 --> 23:10.101
I want to see you tonight.

23:10.136 --> 23:11.498
Ah, I can't.

23:11.533 --> 23:12.401
Can't. Working a double.

23:12.436 --> 23:13.600
A triple, actually.

23:13.635 --> 23:14.799
Triple?

23:14.834 --> 23:16.368
Yeah, there's some kind of

23:16.403 --> 23:17.166
Big flu going through

23:17.201 --> 23:19.167
The firehouse, and I can't...

23:19.202 --> 23:20.034
you know, I got to cover

23:20.069 --> 23:21.899
For like 3 guys.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.468
Mrs. Turbody, I don't think

23:23.503 --> 23:24.333
I can do this, ok?

23:24.368 --> 23:26.465
It's, it's, it's wrong.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.001
It's so... wrong... you know what

23:29.036 --> 23:30.784
I mean? ...in so many ways,

23:30.819 --> 23:32.610
And I just feel like, you know,

23:32.645 --> 23:35.272
Um, I mean, the sex is great,

23:35.307 --> 23:37.403
And, you know, I think I could

23:37.438 --> 23:39.569
Go longer if I had, you know,

23:39.604 --> 23:43.402
More practice, and you know,

23:43.437 --> 23:47.201
Maybe, you know, maybe...

23:47.236 --> 23:48.151
day after tomorrow?

23:48.186 --> 23:49.067
Well, then, day after

23:49.102 --> 23:50.565
Tomorrow it is.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.667
I'll be expecting you.

23:51.702 --> 23:53.934
All right. Bye.

24:58.633 --> 25:00.799
Oh, my God.

25:00.834 --> 25:03.034
You little sneak.

25:04.750 --> 25:05.733
Mom, I want to stay

25:05.768 --> 25:06.576
At Stacy's tonight.

25:06.611 --> 25:07.547
Well, you'll have

25:07.582 --> 25:08.484
To ask your father.

25:08.519 --> 25:09.782
Why?

25:09.817 --> 25:11.216
Because it's his night,

25:11.251 --> 25:13.184
And I left him a message to pick

25:13.219 --> 25:14.751
The 2 of you up after school.

25:14.786 --> 25:16.284
Even after that whole mess

25:16.319 --> 25:17.715
With uncle Johnny?

25:17.750 --> 25:19.084
Sweetie, I'm not nuts about

25:19.119 --> 25:20.251
Him spending time with you,

25:20.286 --> 25:21.384
But I am not about to set him

25:21.419 --> 25:22.317
Off by changing our

25:22.352 --> 25:23.282
Arrangements.

25:23.317 --> 25:25.633
Not after what he did.

25:25.668 --> 25:27.950
What about what you did?

25:27.985 --> 25:29.049
Excuse me?

25:29.084 --> 25:30.417
You think it was easy having

25:30.452 --> 25:31.750
To lie to him all this time?

25:31.785 --> 25:32.634
We did it because

25:32.669 --> 25:33.460
You asked us to.

25:33.495 --> 25:34.216
Don't get smart

25:34.251 --> 25:36.515
With me, young lady.

25:36.550 --> 25:37.583
Hey, I really didn't think he

25:37.618 --> 25:39.884
Was ready to hear the news,

25:39.919 --> 25:41.551
And obviously he wasn't.

25:41.586 --> 25:43.385
So why don't you go and pray

25:43.420 --> 25:45.535
For a more normal family

25:45.570 --> 25:47.693
If you think that will help?

25:47.728 --> 25:49.817
The lord can only do so much.

26:14.650 --> 26:16.233
How they hanging, Chief?

26:16.268 --> 26:17.817
By a thread, Franco.

26:19.917 --> 26:21.750
You have one

26:21.785 --> 26:23.583
Unheard message.

26:24.451 --> 26:26.617
Tommy, it's Janet. Listen.

26:30.418 --> 26:32.234
Can't park there, lady.

26:32.269 --> 26:34.051
What are you looking at?

26:34.086 --> 26:35.185
What?

26:35.220 --> 26:36.249
No good.

26:36.284 --> 26:37.384
I got to talk to you.

26:37.419 --> 26:38.515
About what?

26:38.550 --> 26:39.484
I was cleaning today.

26:39.519 --> 26:40.582
Uh-Huh.

26:40.617 --> 26:41.784
What? I was, I was cleaning.

26:41.819 --> 26:42.483
Mm-Hmm.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.317
I clean 'cause things

26:43.352 --> 26:43.982
Get dirty.

26:44.017 --> 26:44.950
Yeah, and at which point did

26:44.985 --> 26:45.884
You switch from cleaning mode

26:45.919 --> 26:46.882
Into snooping mode?

26:46.917 --> 26:47.984
I have a right to snoop.

26:48.019 --> 26:48.648
Mm-Hmm.

26:48.683 --> 26:49.683
Snooping is a really big part

26:49.718 --> 26:50.449
Of being a good mom.

26:50.484 --> 26:51.800
I am not arguing with you.

26:51.835 --> 26:53.117
Ok, anyway, if I hadn't have

26:53.152 --> 26:54.349
Snooped then I wouldn't

26:54.384 --> 26:55.317
Have found out what Damian's

26:55.352 --> 26:56.548
Been doing.

26:56.583 --> 26:57.350
What do you mean?

26:57.385 --> 26:58.117
What, what, what's he

26:58.152 --> 26:59.216
Been doing?

26:59.251 --> 27:00.950
What do you think I mean?

27:00.985 --> 27:01.582
I'm asking you.

27:01.617 --> 27:02.867
You were the one who was

27:02.902 --> 27:04.117
Snooping, snoop dogg.

27:06.717 --> 27:09.249
Holy shit.

27:09.284 --> 27:10.817
Roofies and viagra.

27:10.852 --> 27:11.951
What are roofies?

27:11.986 --> 27:13.035
You don't know

27:13.070 --> 27:14.376
What roofies are?

27:14.411 --> 27:15.648
I don't know. Do I?

27:15.683 --> 27:17.250
It's the date-Rape drug.

27:17.285 --> 27:18.668
It's the thing you slip in

27:18.703 --> 27:19.893
A chick's drink, and like half

27:19.928 --> 27:20.906
An hour later she's basically,

27:20.941 --> 27:21.884
You can do whatever you want

27:21.919 --> 27:22.551
With her.

27:22.586 --> 27:23.235
Eww!

27:23.270 --> 27:23.849
I know.

27:23.884 --> 27:24.615
That's what he's doing?

27:24.650 --> 27:25.584
<i>That's not what he's doing.</i>

27:25.619 --> 27:26.518
He's just probably doing

27:26.553 --> 27:27.568
The selling part.

27:27.603 --> 27:28.543
Ok, that's worse.

27:28.578 --> 27:29.964
That's not worse.

27:29.999 --> 27:31.241
That's not worse, ok?

27:31.276 --> 27:32.563
It's way not worse, ok,

27:32.598 --> 27:33.815
'Cause he's not doing

27:33.850 --> 27:35.750
Either the dating or the raping.

27:35.785 --> 27:37.650
He's just doing the selling...

27:37.685 --> 27:39.651
to the guys who are doing

27:39.686 --> 27:41.617
The dating and the raping.

27:41.652 --> 27:43.384
I'll talk to him.

27:47.017 --> 27:48.982
Yeah, I, uh,

27:49.017 --> 27:50.000
Think he might know.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.243
If he knew, you'd be

27:51.278 --> 27:52.281
In a body cast by now.

27:52.316 --> 27:53.284
Yeah, but he's giving me,

27:53.319 --> 27:54.249
Like, strange looks.

27:54.284 --> 27:55.351
He's acting really weird.

27:55.386 --> 27:56.383
Yikes.

27:56.418 --> 27:57.682
Yikes? What yikes?

27:57.717 --> 27:59.084
Sounds like the same sort

27:59.119 --> 28:00.451
Of stuff he pulled with fred.

28:00.486 --> 28:01.383
Who the hell's fred?

28:01.418 --> 28:02.715
Tommy's childhood friend.

28:02.750 --> 28:03.850
The one he tortured till he hung

28:03.885 --> 28:04.901
Himself because he found out we

28:04.936 --> 28:05.917
Were dating each other behind

28:05.952 --> 28:06.815
His back.

28:06.850 --> 28:07.617
You think Tommy's trying to

28:07.652 --> 28:08.583
Get me to hang myself?

28:08.618 --> 28:10.782
Not necessarily.

28:10.817 --> 28:11.750
Maybe he thinks you'll put your

28:11.785 --> 28:13.217
Head in the oven or...

28:13.252 --> 28:14.082
that's great.

28:14.117 --> 28:14.815
Jump off a bridge.

28:14.850 --> 28:15.650
But I think he's just messing

28:15.685 --> 28:16.282
With you.

28:16.317 --> 28:17.234
Yeah, well, what do I do?

28:17.269 --> 28:18.116
Well, we don't know that he

28:18.151 --> 28:20.900
Knows, so definitely steer clear

28:20.935 --> 28:23.409
If you can, but... don't act

28:23.444 --> 28:25.884
Suspicious and don't hang

28:25.919 --> 28:27.216
Yourself.

28:27.251 --> 28:29.351
It's what he wants... maybe.

28:29.386 --> 28:30.151
You want

28:30.186 --> 28:30.951
Another one, miss?

28:30.986 --> 28:31.682
I'm not paying

28:31.717 --> 28:32.484
For the small talk, slim.

28:32.519 --> 28:33.518
Are you in a bar?

28:33.553 --> 28:34.884
Yeah! So?

28:35.950 --> 28:37.084
Uh, it's 10:00 in the morning,

28:37.119 --> 28:38.749
Maggie.

28:38.784 --> 28:39.683
Who you talking to?

28:39.718 --> 28:40.349
Hey, hi.

28:40.384 --> 28:41.784
Sean.

28:41.819 --> 28:43.149
Um, nobody.

28:43.184 --> 28:44.583
You don't really need a phone

28:44.618 --> 28:45.701
To talk to nobody.

28:45.736 --> 28:46.643
It's just... it's

28:46.678 --> 28:47.515
The cable company.

28:47.550 --> 28:48.483
I forgot to pay a Bill.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.684
Hey, listen, you people better

28:49.719 --> 28:50.751
Stop calling me, all right?

28:50.786 --> 28:51.784
The check is in the mail.

28:52.683 --> 28:53.984
Check is in the mail.

28:54.019 --> 28:55.116
Yeah.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.701
That was lame.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.216
Lame excuse.

28:58.251 --> 28:59.717
Yeah, well, it's all I could

28:59.752 --> 29:00.751
Think of.

29:00.786 --> 29:01.750
Yeah.

29:03.217 --> 29:04.217
Got something in your tooth?

29:04.252 --> 29:05.849
I don't know.

29:05.884 --> 29:07.967
You know, Sean, lying is

29:08.002 --> 29:10.176
Really not your, uh, forte.

29:10.211 --> 29:11.614
Yeah, no, no, it's not.

29:11.649 --> 29:12.699
And you don't know

29:12.734 --> 29:13.750
What forte means.

29:13.785 --> 29:14.434
I don't.

29:14.469 --> 29:15.049
No.

29:15.084 --> 29:16.650
Forte is like something that

29:16.685 --> 29:18.217
You're really, really good at.

29:18.252 --> 29:19.715
Right, yeah, ok.

29:19.750 --> 29:20.850
Oh, so like in high school, when

29:20.885 --> 29:22.584
I was all-State, I was like a,

29:22.619 --> 29:24.284
Like a forte free safety, yeah?

29:24.319 --> 29:25.316
Yeah, exactly.

29:25.351 --> 29:27.850
Cool, yeah. Thanks.

29:27.885 --> 29:29.351
Sorry.

29:31.750 --> 29:33.184
Yeah, I'm...

29:37.017 --> 29:37.817
See you later.

29:37.852 --> 29:39.249
Ok.

29:39.284 --> 29:41.449
Check out the bling.

29:41.484 --> 29:42.351
That's like the nicest watch

29:42.386 --> 29:43.249
I've ever seen.

29:43.284 --> 29:44.984
Nah, I wouldn't say all that.

29:45.019 --> 29:45.648
Let me see.

29:45.683 --> 29:46.351
I wonder how much she

29:46.386 --> 29:47.016
Paid for that.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.351
Oh, few grand at least.

29:48.386 --> 29:49.168
Nah, you think?

29:49.203 --> 29:49.950
The thing's silver.

29:49.985 --> 29:50.615
Oh, yeah.

29:50.650 --> 29:51.683
That's a patek philippe, man.

29:51.718 --> 29:52.717
My uncle teddy used to have

29:52.752 --> 29:53.383
One of those.

29:53.418 --> 29:54.451
I don't think he paid for it,

29:54.486 --> 29:55.249
But, yeah, unless it's

29:55.284 --> 29:56.351
A knockoff, it's a, it's a lot...

29:56.386 --> 29:57.268
where you going, Sean?

29:57.303 --> 29:58.151
What? Oh, I was just,

29:58.186 --> 29:59.849
Uh, nowhere.

29:59.884 --> 30:01.184
So is this a gift

30:01.219 --> 30:02.801
From your old lady?

30:02.836 --> 30:04.043
Sorry. Girlfriend?

30:04.078 --> 30:05.251
She's not old, Lou.

30:05.286 --> 30:06.018
She's older.

30:06.053 --> 30:06.715
Older lady with

30:06.750 --> 30:08.016
A shitload of money.

30:08.051 --> 30:08.984
Yeah, she's well off. So?

30:09.019 --> 30:09.768
Boy toy.

30:09.803 --> 30:10.493
No.

30:10.528 --> 30:11.039
Yeah.

30:11.074 --> 30:11.515
Please.

30:11.550 --> 30:12.383
Hey, we're not

30:12.418 --> 30:13.182
Judging you, man.

30:13.217 --> 30:14.017
Just, you know, work it

30:14.052 --> 30:14.715
To your benefit.

30:14.750 --> 30:15.384
Work it... what are you

30:15.419 --> 30:16.049
Talking about?

30:16.084 --> 30:16.817
Get as much as you can while

30:16.852 --> 30:17.548
The going's good.

30:17.583 --> 30:18.548
That's all I'm saying.

30:18.583 --> 30:19.616
Yeah, well, what I'm saying

30:19.651 --> 30:20.650
Is I'm not about that, ok?

30:20.685 --> 30:21.368
Oh, really?

30:21.403 --> 30:22.016
Yeah, really.

30:22.051 --> 30:23.284
I don't trade sex for goods

30:23.319 --> 30:24.301
Like some arapaho whore.

30:24.336 --> 30:25.284
Sex with me is purely

30:25.319 --> 30:26.116
About the sex.

30:26.151 --> 30:26.917
That's why I'm so goddamn

30:26.952 --> 30:27.582
Good at it.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.383
Speaking of the sex,

30:28.418 --> 30:29.548
When you bang her, does her

30:29.583 --> 30:30.683
Walker get in the way, or do you

30:30.718 --> 30:31.484
Use it for leverage?

30:31.519 --> 30:32.651
Ohh...

30:32.686 --> 30:33.784
what?

30:34.784 --> 30:35.784
You're a jerk, man.

30:35.819 --> 30:36.784
A legitimate question.

30:36.819 --> 30:37.615
An asshole.

30:37.650 --> 30:38.984
Oh, God, get over it.

30:42.051 --> 30:43.518
Oh, man.

30:53.984 --> 30:55.884
I was gonna get a sandwich.

30:55.919 --> 30:57.784
You want any... want anything?

30:59.850 --> 31:00.515
Right.

31:00.550 --> 31:01.484
How 'bout I'll get you a drink?

31:01.519 --> 31:03.268
You need a drink or...

31:03.303 --> 31:05.017
wow, I got to, uh,

31:05.052 --> 31:06.484
I got to pee.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.251
Maybe you should call him

31:11.286 --> 31:12.116
Again.

31:12.151 --> 31:13.934
I called him 3 times already.

31:13.969 --> 31:15.717
Maybe his phone is turned off.

31:15.752 --> 31:17.351
Better call mommy.

31:17.386 --> 31:18.915
I have a better idea.

31:18.950 --> 31:20.100
You want to go to a big-Girls'

31:20.135 --> 31:21.251
Sleepover at my friend Stacy's

31:21.286 --> 31:22.282
House?

31:22.317 --> 31:23.867
Stacy from Jesus class?

31:23.902 --> 31:25.383
Yeah, it'll be fun.

31:25.418 --> 31:27.434
We can eat popcorn and watch

31:27.469 --> 31:29.451
Movies and talk about stuff.

31:29.486 --> 31:30.151
Do we have to talk

31:30.186 --> 31:31.615
About Jesus?

31:31.650 --> 31:33.683
Well, maybe a little.

31:33.718 --> 31:35.717
You better call mommy.

31:35.752 --> 31:36.884
Tommy.

31:37.817 --> 31:41.016
Tom.

31:41.051 --> 31:42.717
Hey, where were you?

31:45.784 --> 31:48.416
Hey, I am talking to you.

31:48.451 --> 31:49.734
You know, it is bad enough that

31:49.769 --> 31:51.017
You traumatized our children by

31:51.052 --> 31:52.218
Going ballistic at dad's

31:52.253 --> 31:53.384
Birthday party, but now you

31:53.419 --> 31:54.249
Leave them standing in

31:54.284 --> 31:55.250
The street waiting for you?

31:55.285 --> 31:56.217
Tommy, let one of the young

31:56.252 --> 31:56.982
Guys get that.

31:57.017 --> 31:57.717
No, I got it, Chief.

31:57.752 --> 31:58.416
It's all right.

31:58.451 --> 32:00.434
Are you listening to me?

32:00.469 --> 32:02.418
Tommy, you were supposed

32:02.453 --> 32:04.982
To pick them up.

32:05.017 --> 32:05.850
They were waiting at the school

32:05.885 --> 32:06.817
For almost an hour.

32:06.852 --> 32:07.618
I left you a message.

32:07.653 --> 32:08.384
What's up, frankie?

32:08.419 --> 32:09.084
Hey, Tommy.

32:09.119 --> 32:09.801
What's up, jan?

32:09.836 --> 32:10.449
What do you got?

32:10.484 --> 32:11.217
Well, we're up to almost

32:11.252 --> 32:11.950
A grand in the kitty now.

32:11.985 --> 32:12.615
No shit?

32:12.650 --> 32:13.584
Yeah, I think Garrity had to

32:13.619 --> 32:14.518
Sell some of his vital organs to

32:14.553 --> 32:15.349
Stay alive.

32:15.384 --> 32:16.151
I hope his brain was one

32:16.186 --> 32:17.251
Of the organs.

32:17.286 --> 32:18.317
Yeah.

32:21.117 --> 32:22.316
Here's the deal.

32:22.351 --> 32:25.050
Every time I hear your voice

32:25.085 --> 32:27.750
On my voicemail, I hit delete.

32:27.785 --> 32:29.316
Ok, fine.

32:29.351 --> 32:31.034
You don't want to talk to me,

32:31.069 --> 32:32.717
You can talk to my new lawyer.

32:32.752 --> 32:33.683
Ok? 'Cause the gloves

32:33.718 --> 32:35.349
Are off, Tommy.

32:35.384 --> 32:36.882
Hey, after this shit

32:36.917 --> 32:37.800
And the shit that you pulled

32:37.835 --> 32:38.683
The other night, I will get

32:38.718 --> 32:39.449
It all.

32:39.484 --> 32:40.815
The girls, the money,

32:40.850 --> 32:41.900
The furniture, everything.

32:41.935 --> 32:42.915
Hey, what's this I hear

32:42.950 --> 32:44.117
About you chewing nicotine gum?

32:44.152 --> 32:45.284
That's flat-Out cheating.

32:45.319 --> 32:46.317
Hey, there.

32:47.184 --> 32:48.251
Engine.

33:28.117 --> 33:30.867
Nice, nice.

33:30.902 --> 33:32.609
Oh, shit.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.031
You okay?

33:34.066 --> 33:35.383
I'm fine, I'm fine.

33:35.418 --> 33:38.017
Bring that boarding, guys.

33:38.052 --> 33:39.618
Get her feet.

33:39.653 --> 33:41.385
Grab the feet.

33:41.420 --> 33:42.785
You got 'em? Okay.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.068
Fancy outfit.

33:45.103 --> 33:47.282
This guy must be rich.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.750
He's a handsome cab

33:48.785 --> 33:50.134
Driver, numb nuts.

33:50.169 --> 33:51.484
He's not so handsome

33:51.519 --> 33:52.316
Anymore.

33:52.351 --> 33:53.316
Hey, something

33:53.351 --> 33:55.351
Missing from this equation?

33:55.386 --> 33:56.682
You mean Sean?

33:56.717 --> 33:58.151
No, I mean the horse

33:58.186 --> 33:59.749
Asshole.

33:59.784 --> 34:01.017
Where's the goddamn horse?

34:06.750 --> 34:10.984
Hi, hi, there.

34:11.018 --> 34:12.683
You okay?

34:14.184 --> 34:15.917
Hey, big boy.

34:17.484 --> 34:19.648
Hi.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.216
How you doing?

34:21.251 --> 34:23.284
You all right? Huh?

34:24.384 --> 34:25.550
What's the matter?

34:25.585 --> 34:26.949
Huh?

34:26.984 --> 34:28.617
It's gonna be all right, yeah.

34:28.652 --> 34:30.268
It's okay, shh.

34:30.303 --> 34:31.849
You got a big cut.

34:31.884 --> 34:34.518
Wow, looks like it hurts, huh?

34:35.518 --> 34:36.815
Yeah.

34:36.850 --> 34:38.117
Get some of this stuff off you,

34:38.152 --> 34:39.835
Okay?

34:39.870 --> 34:41.483
Hey.

34:41.518 --> 34:43.016
Oh, pop your stitches?

34:43.052 --> 34:44.081
Yeah, a couple.

34:44.117 --> 34:45.033
You cut that with a

34:45.068 --> 34:45.915
Glass in the shower?

34:45.949 --> 34:46.750
You know what, it's none

34:46.784 --> 34:47.534
Of your business.

34:47.569 --> 34:48.393
It's none of my

34:48.428 --> 34:50.039
Business now?

34:50.074 --> 34:51.629
Holy shit.

34:51.664 --> 34:53.149
Howdy, boys.

34:53.184 --> 34:54.384
Who's your new friend,

34:54.418 --> 34:55.282
Garrity?

34:55.317 --> 34:56.184
Oh, I found him down

34:56.219 --> 34:57.016
There in the Meadow.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.217
He must've broke free from the

34:58.252 --> 34:59.584
Carriage on the impact.

34:59.619 --> 35:00.551
Since when are you

35:00.586 --> 35:01.535
The horse whisperer?

35:01.570 --> 35:02.449
I used to have a horse.

35:02.484 --> 35:03.951
Well, it wasn't really my horse.

35:03.986 --> 35:05.418
Actually, it was a pony really.

35:05.453 --> 35:07.318
Yeah, summer camp.

35:07.353 --> 35:09.184
Buttons was his name.

35:09.219 --> 35:10.915
Yeah, buttons.

35:10.950 --> 35:12.151
I looked forward to it every

35:12.186 --> 35:12.849
July, you know?

35:12.884 --> 35:14.317
So I could ride him again.

35:14.352 --> 35:15.750
Yeah, he got laminitis.

35:15.785 --> 35:17.468
What's laminitis?

35:17.503 --> 35:19.116
I don't know, but

35:19.151 --> 35:21.451
Whatever it is, it kills horses.

35:21.486 --> 35:22.715
Anyway, he died.

35:22.750 --> 35:23.784
Summer camp was never the same,

35:23.819 --> 35:24.915
Of course.

35:24.950 --> 35:26.600
And I vowed I would never ride

35:26.635 --> 35:28.059
Another horse again 'til today.

35:28.094 --> 35:29.484
He's a beauty though, isn't he?

35:29.519 --> 35:30.449
Looks about two lengths

35:30.484 --> 35:31.683
From the glue factory if you ask

35:31.718 --> 35:32.216
Me.

35:32.251 --> 35:33.418
Come on, a little respect.

35:33.453 --> 35:34.418
This guy used to be a

35:34.453 --> 35:35.116
Thoroughbred.

35:35.151 --> 35:36.017
You can tell from the muscle

35:36.052 --> 35:36.815
Tone.

35:36.850 --> 35:37.849
Looks like about 200

35:37.884 --> 35:38.950
Bags worth of puppy chow to me.

35:38.985 --> 35:40.017
No, he's just malnourished

35:40.052 --> 35:41.049
Is all.

35:41.084 --> 35:42.117
Well, those days are over, right

35:42.152 --> 35:43.383
Buttons?

35:43.418 --> 35:44.701
I'm gonna get you a nice warm

35:44.736 --> 35:45.984
Stable and some oats and some

35:46.019 --> 35:46.782
Hay.

35:46.817 --> 35:48.217
Everything's gonna be all right.

35:49.351 --> 35:50.682
Buttons!

35:50.717 --> 35:52.650
Wow, you weren't shitting

35:52.685 --> 35:54.234
About that pedigree, Gary.

35:54.269 --> 35:55.784
Look at the grace of those

35:55.819 --> 35:56.683
Strides.

35:59.051 --> 36:01.317
Oh, man.

36:01.352 --> 36:03.548
Oh, man.

36:03.583 --> 36:04.451
I'll tell you one thing

36:04.486 --> 36:05.182
Though.

36:05.217 --> 36:06.583
Who knew those new city buses

36:06.618 --> 36:07.750
Were made so well, huh?

36:07.785 --> 36:08.882
Barely a dent.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.000
Tommy, Lou, go check

36:10.035 --> 36:11.049
On the passengers.

36:11.084 --> 36:12.217
Franco, take the probie and grab

36:12.252 --> 36:13.301
A couple of shovels and start

36:13.336 --> 36:14.351
Scraping secretariat off the

36:14.386 --> 36:18.016
Street.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.151
Take a minute if you need it,

36:19.186 --> 36:22.984
Sean.

36:35.884 --> 36:37.267
You know what, that's

36:37.302 --> 36:38.651
Not funny, assholes.

36:40.417 --> 36:41.415
All right, you know

36:41.450 --> 36:45.684
What, knock it off, okay?

36:45.719 --> 36:46.984
Knock what off?

36:47.019 --> 36:48.115
Hey.

36:48.150 --> 36:49.183
Tom, nothing, the guys were just

36:49.218 --> 36:50.551
Being dicks.

36:50.586 --> 36:51.849
Oh, really?

36:51.884 --> 36:52.800
Yeah, how are you?

36:52.835 --> 36:53.709
Good, how are you?

36:53.744 --> 36:54.584
I'm all right.

36:54.619 --> 36:55.048
Yeah?

36:55.083 --> 36:55.984
What's going on,

36:56.019 --> 36:56.449
Guys?

36:56.484 --> 36:59.217
Hey, Franco.

36:59.252 --> 37:01.951
So, so Sean.

37:01.986 --> 37:02.549
Yeah?

37:02.584 --> 37:03.450
Gonna see your new

37:03.485 --> 37:04.315
Girlfriend?

37:04.350 --> 37:06.018
Uh, yeah, or maybe.

37:06.053 --> 37:07.535
I don't know.

37:07.570 --> 37:09.018
Which one is it?

37:09.053 --> 37:09.782
What?

37:09.817 --> 37:10.817
"Yeah, maybe, I don't

37:10.852 --> 37:11.684
Know?"

37:11.719 --> 37:12.901
Pick one.

37:12.936 --> 37:14.427
Yeah, yeah.

37:14.462 --> 37:15.573
Atta boy.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.649
Is she good?

37:16.684 --> 37:17.550
Yup, she's doing good.

37:17.585 --> 37:18.684
She's really good.

37:18.719 --> 37:19.784
No, no, no, no, no.

37:19.819 --> 37:20.816
I mean, um...

37:20.851 --> 37:21.884

37:21.919 --> 37:22.582
You.

37:22.617 --> 37:23.849

37:23.884 --> 37:24.949
She's... I don't...

37:24.984 --> 37:25.934
that's not really... I'm not so

37:25.969 --> 37:26.884
Comfortable discussing that

37:26.919 --> 37:27.549
Really.

37:27.584 --> 37:28.415
Since when?

37:28.450 --> 37:29.284
We talk about this shit

37:29.319 --> 37:30.082
All the time.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.083
It's pretty much all we talk

37:31.118 --> 37:31.616
About.

37:31.651 --> 37:32.767
She like it from the back?

37:32.802 --> 37:33.884
Hair pulled? Ass smacked?

37:33.919 --> 37:34.883
She chug nut?

37:34.918 --> 37:35.883
That's... that's a

37:35.918 --> 37:36.951
Little... I'm trying to be

37:36.986 --> 37:37.949
Respectful, okay?

37:37.984 --> 37:39.018
I respect her, she's...

37:40.018 --> 37:41.584
Respectable.

37:41.619 --> 37:43.451
Come on.

37:43.486 --> 37:45.284
You know?

37:47.183 --> 37:48.018
So...

37:49.150 --> 37:50.382
What you're saying is,

37:50.417 --> 37:54.217
You're pretty much all about...

37:54.252 --> 37:56.051
respect now.

37:56.086 --> 37:57.816
Yeah. Yeah.

37:57.851 --> 37:59.083
You know, trying.

38:01.851 --> 38:02.617
I'm gonna to...

38:03.083 --> 38:04.117
I'm gonna go back and bury

38:04.152 --> 38:04.449

38:04.484 --> 38:07.884
I promised buttons I would.

38:11.551 --> 38:13.215
See ya.

38:13.250 --> 38:14.682
Jesus, Tom.

38:14.717 --> 38:15.918

38:15.953 --> 38:16.450
Said it would be.

38:16.485 --> 38:17.516
Told ya.

38:17.551 --> 38:19.984
Kid's dying inside.

38:28.484 --> 38:29.350
What're you doing?

38:29.385 --> 38:30.217
Nothing, I'm just

38:30.252 --> 38:30.716
Sitting.

38:30.751 --> 38:31.516
Coulda sworn I saw

38:31.551 --> 38:32.551
Something very book-Like in your

38:32.586 --> 38:35.318
Hands.

38:35.353 --> 38:38.015
Show me.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.382
<i>The tao of pooh.</i>

38:39.417 --> 38:40.651
No, it's the tayo of

38:40.686 --> 38:42.148
Pooh.

38:42.183 --> 38:45.249
It's pronounced...

38:45.284 --> 38:46.249
yo, Mike, I really can't

38:46.284 --> 38:48.250
Understand how you could be seen

38:48.285 --> 38:50.217
In public purchasing this shit.

38:50.252 --> 38:51.250
It's not shit, a friend

38:51.285 --> 38:51.816
Gave it to me.

38:51.851 --> 38:52.918
It says pooh right in

38:52.953 --> 38:53.282
The title.

38:53.317 --> 38:54.250
It's a different kind

38:54.285 --> 38:54.816
Of pooh.

38:54.851 --> 38:55.517
The tayo-Ist...

38:55.552 --> 38:56.317
taoist.

38:56.352 --> 38:57.334
Whatever.

38:57.369 --> 38:58.282
Taoist.

38:58.317 --> 39:00.317
P'u means natural.

39:00.352 --> 39:02.282
Plain, simple.

39:02.317 --> 39:03.183
Yeah, hand it over.

39:03.218 --> 39:03.916
Why?

39:03.951 --> 39:05.584
Because a firehouse is no

39:05.619 --> 39:07.217
Place for sensitive souls,

39:07.252 --> 39:08.082
Probie.

39:08.117 --> 39:09.716
You used to write poetry.

39:09.751 --> 39:11.334
Yeah, and it cost me my house

39:11.369 --> 39:12.918
And my wife, and a whole lot

39:12.953 --> 39:13.516
More.

39:13.551 --> 39:14.415
So give it over.

39:14.450 --> 39:15.484
You can't order me to stop

39:15.519 --> 39:16.368
Reading.

39:16.403 --> 39:17.182
I'm not.

39:17.217 --> 39:18.667
I'm ordering you to stop filling

39:18.702 --> 39:20.093
Your mind with this bullshit,

39:20.128 --> 39:21.906
Fortune-Cookie philosophy.

39:21.941 --> 39:23.312
You're taking life lessons

39:23.347 --> 39:24.684
From a seml-Retarded bear,

39:24.719 --> 39:26.415
Mikey.

39:26.450 --> 39:28.150
And it's not even a real bear.

39:28.185 --> 39:29.767
Consider yourself fortunate

39:29.802 --> 39:31.576
That you're not burdened

39:31.611 --> 39:33.315
By an overactive mind.

39:33.350 --> 39:34.350
Stick to cartoons and coloring

39:34.385 --> 39:36.082
Books.

39:36.117 --> 39:37.617
No, I'm not stupid, you know.

39:37.652 --> 39:38.749
I'm just simpleminded.

39:38.784 --> 39:40.018
The book says that pooh is like

39:40.053 --> 39:40.749
An uncarved block.

39:40.784 --> 39:41.951
You know, that's kind of how I

39:41.986 --> 39:42.482
Feel.

39:42.517 --> 39:44.000
Like an uncarved block.

39:44.035 --> 39:45.692
It's hard to disagree with.

39:45.727 --> 39:47.315
Yeah, you're busting balls,

39:47.350 --> 39:48.884
But you know, winnie's as simple

39:48.919 --> 39:49.749
As they come.

39:49.784 --> 39:51.584
He just roams the woods, hangs

39:51.619 --> 39:53.384
With his pals, eats some honey,

39:53.419 --> 39:54.382
Takes a nap.

39:54.417 --> 39:55.415
He doesn't care about

39:55.450 --> 39:57.033
Understanding anything or...

39:57.068 --> 39:58.617
or even himself or the names

39:58.652 --> 40:00.082
That people call him.

40:00.117 --> 40:01.950
He just... he just is, you know?

40:01.985 --> 40:03.484
He accepts things as they are.

40:03.519 --> 40:04.984
That's the key to his happiness.

40:05.019 --> 40:06.018
That's what this all is,

40:06.053 --> 40:06.983
Really.

40:07.018 --> 40:08.015
I mean, you're a little

40:08.050 --> 40:09.083
Depressed about the fact that

40:09.118 --> 40:10.117
We're gonna keep calling you the

40:10.152 --> 40:11.115
Probie.

40:11.150 --> 40:12.600
Maybe this is the big problem

40:12.635 --> 40:14.276
That's caused this little

40:14.311 --> 40:15.883
Existential life crisis.

40:15.918 --> 40:16.984
You don't know from problems,

40:17.019 --> 40:18.215
Kid.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.250
It's not that, I'm just

40:19.285 --> 40:20.215
Starting to realize that

40:20.250 --> 40:21.317
Nobody's ever gonna have all the

40:21.352 --> 40:22.582
Answers, you know?

40:22.617 --> 40:24.050
I mean, you may think you know

40:24.085 --> 40:25.484
Everything, but you don't.

40:25.519 --> 40:26.349
And you can't.

40:26.384 --> 40:27.549
And you never will, so you

40:27.584 --> 40:28.951
Should just stop trying and life

40:28.986 --> 40:34.883
Will get a lot easier.

40:34.918 --> 40:36.067
Give me the goddamned book.

40:36.102 --> 40:37.217
Give me the goddamned book!

40:37.252 --> 40:37.983
That's an order!

40:38.018 --> 40:40.018
Give me the goddamned book!

40:40.053 --> 40:42.018
Give me the goddamned book!

40:42.053 --> 40:43.482
Go get your own!

40:43.517 --> 40:44.918
Get back here, asshole!

40:44.953 --> 40:47.616
What the...

40:47.651 --> 40:49.449
the hell is going on?

40:49.484 --> 40:50.833
Just leave it alone, Tom.

40:50.868 --> 40:53.209
You know, you've been acting

40:53.244 --> 40:55.551
Very un-Lou like lately, Lou.

40:55.586 --> 40:56.716
You know?

40:56.751 --> 40:58.384
I mean, you come in, I can smell

40:58.419 --> 40:59.701
Booze on your breath sometimes.

40:59.736 --> 41:00.984
And... jumping down everybody's

41:01.019 --> 41:02.315
Throat.

41:02.350 --> 41:03.384
And snapping, left, right and

41:03.419 --> 41:04.168
Center.

41:04.203 --> 41:04.883
What's...?

41:04.918 --> 41:05.951
What're you gonna do, tell me

41:05.986 --> 41:07.083
You wanna help me?

41:07.118 --> 41:08.584
Is that it?

41:08.619 --> 41:10.315
You?

41:10.350 --> 41:11.716
Who pissed away his beautiful

41:11.751 --> 41:13.317
Wife and three kids by crawling

41:13.352 --> 41:14.884
Into a bottle for three years?

41:14.919 --> 41:16.150
You're gonna help me?

41:16.185 --> 41:17.048
We're brothers.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.150
That's what we're supposed to

41:18.185 --> 41:18.516
Do.

41:18.551 --> 41:19.617
I've seen how you treat your

41:19.652 --> 41:20.301
Brothers.

41:20.336 --> 41:20.916
Okay?

41:20.951 --> 41:22.067
So why don't you just save this

41:22.102 --> 41:23.183
Intervention for someone who

41:23.218 --> 41:24.916
Gives a shit.

41:24.951 --> 41:27.350
Goddamned hypocrite.

41:34.717 --> 41:37.649
What a nice surprise.

41:37.684 --> 41:38.751
Hey, sorry for dropping by

41:38.786 --> 41:39.749
Unannounced.

41:39.784 --> 41:40.983
No, it's okay, I'm just

41:41.018 --> 41:41.984
Fixing dinner for some friends.

41:42.019 --> 41:42.749
Come on in.

41:42.784 --> 41:43.883
Oh, no, I really can't.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.250
I just wanted to stop by and

41:45.285 --> 41:46.767
Give this back to you.

41:46.802 --> 41:48.250
Oh, you don't like it

41:48.285 --> 41:48.682
Anymore?

41:48.717 --> 41:49.616
No, no, I love it.

41:49.651 --> 41:50.767
It's just that I recently found

41:50.802 --> 41:51.884
Out that it's worth more than my

41:51.919 --> 41:52.868
Jeep.

41:52.903 --> 41:53.782
Right.

41:53.817 --> 41:55.183
Well, what if I told you it was

41:55.218 --> 41:56.150
A knockoff?

41:57.018 --> 41:58.150
Um, all the same, I really...

41:58.185 --> 42:00.918
I can't accept it.

42:00.953 --> 42:03.082
I gotta go.

42:03.117 --> 42:04.551
So, I'll call you.

42:04.586 --> 42:08.584
I know.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.317
Hey, dude, what can I get

42:22.352 --> 42:22.949
You?

42:22.984 --> 42:24.550
Java'd be nice.

42:24.585 --> 42:26.117
Sure thing.

42:27.951 --> 42:30.050
What's in that again?

42:31.018 --> 42:32.301
Is the owner around?

42:32.336 --> 42:33.584
You're looking at him.

42:33.619 --> 42:34.751
Jerry Reilly.

42:34.786 --> 42:35.849
Larry bird.

42:35.884 --> 42:36.983
You're shitting me, right?

42:37.018 --> 42:38.083
My folks were big celtics

42:38.118 --> 42:38.949
Fans.

42:38.984 --> 42:40.048
Call me birdy.

42:40.083 --> 42:41.082
Birdy, I saw your sign

42:41.117 --> 42:42.150
Outside, and I'm looking to pick

42:42.185 --> 42:44.150
Up a couple extra bucks.

42:44.185 --> 42:45.551
You're FDNY?

42:45.586 --> 42:46.935
23 years.

42:46.970 --> 42:48.249
Cool.

42:48.284 --> 42:49.250
I am a little bit rusty,

42:49.285 --> 42:50.217
But I used to pour down at

42:50.252 --> 42:51.284
Mchales.

42:51.319 --> 42:52.282
Mchales.

42:52.317 --> 42:53.484
Another celtic.

42:53.519 --> 42:54.148
Aaah.

42:54.183 --> 42:55.284
It's kismet.

43:25.384 --> 43:27.950
Hey.

43:27.985 --> 43:29.918
Damien.

43:29.953 --> 43:31.816
Hello?

43:31.851 --> 43:33.584
What's going on?

43:33.619 --> 43:35.048
Nothing.

43:35.083 --> 43:36.284
Don't nothing me.

43:36.319 --> 43:37.784
Come here.

43:41.584 --> 43:42.617
You're mom found drugs in

43:42.652 --> 43:43.682
Your room again.

43:43.717 --> 43:44.551
What was she doing in my

43:44.586 --> 43:45.182
Room?

43:45.217 --> 43:46.449
She was cleaning, okay?

43:46.484 --> 43:47.584
She seems to be doing a lot

43:47.619 --> 43:48.315
Of that lately.

43:48.350 --> 43:49.349
She likes to clean, you

43:49.384 --> 43:51.233
Know, when she stressed out.

43:51.268 --> 43:53.083
It's a big de-Stresser for her.

43:53.118 --> 43:53.849
"De-Stresser"?

43:53.884 --> 43:54.849
Yeah, it's a word.

43:54.884 --> 43:56.484
Yeah, well, I'm not dealing.

43:56.519 --> 43:57.215
All right?

43:57.250 --> 43:58.350
It must be some old stuff.

43:58.385 --> 43:59.450
I had so many hiding places in

43:59.485 --> 44:00.717
That room, I lost track.

44:00.752 --> 44:01.883
All right.

44:01.918 --> 44:03.050
Don't bullshit me.

44:03.085 --> 44:04.450
No, I swear.

44:04.485 --> 44:06.849
Okay.

44:06.884 --> 44:08.250
What's with the long face?

44:08.285 --> 44:10.549
What?

44:10.584 --> 44:12.350
What, Mrs. Turbody?

44:12.385 --> 44:13.382
Come on.

44:13.417 --> 44:14.300
She won't see me anymore.

44:14.335 --> 44:15.276
Won't even talk to me.

44:15.311 --> 44:16.182
You're better off.

44:16.217 --> 44:17.250
You should be dating girls your

44:17.285 --> 44:18.148
Own age anyways.

44:18.183 --> 44:19.166
Women are a pain in the ass.

44:19.201 --> 44:20.092
You got plenty of time to deal

44:20.127 --> 44:21.039
With them when you get older.

44:21.074 --> 44:21.951
I'm in love with her, uncle

44:21.986 --> 44:22.382
Tommy.

44:22.417 --> 44:23.367
You don't know what love is.

44:23.402 --> 44:24.317
You gotta help me get her

44:24.352 --> 44:24.749
Back.

44:24.784 --> 44:25.817
What're you nuts?

44:25.852 --> 44:26.816
No way, no way.

44:26.851 --> 44:27.851
All the things I've done for

44:27.886 --> 44:28.315
You?

44:28.350 --> 44:29.551
All the shit you put me through?

44:29.586 --> 44:30.349
You owe me.

44:30.384 --> 44:31.616
I don't... you owe me.

44:31.651 --> 44:32.784
I'm driving you around all the

44:32.819 --> 44:34.051
Time, covering up this Mrs.

44:34.086 --> 44:35.249
Turbody thing, let's go.

44:35.284 --> 44:36.417
Come on, your mom made a pork

44:36.452 --> 44:39.267
Loin.

44:39.302 --> 44:42.083
Let's go.

44:43.851 --> 44:45.651
Hey, man, where you been?

44:45.686 --> 44:47.916
Just roaming.

44:47.951 --> 44:48.984
Well, the game's about to

44:49.019 --> 44:50.249
Start.

44:50.284 --> 44:51.384
You want a beer?

44:51.419 --> 44:55.616
Yeah.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.115
Rough shift?

44:57.150 --> 44:59.417
Oh, same old shit.

44:59.452 --> 45:01.649
Forget about it, man.

45:01.684 --> 45:03.484
I got a really good feeling

45:03.519 --> 45:05.784
About cleveland.

45:05.819 --> 45:08.050
It's lebron's night.

45:08.085 --> 45:10.015
Thanks, bro.

45:10.050 --> 45:11.050
Quarter court

45:11.085 --> 45:12.949
Pressure.

45:12.984 --> 45:15.284
Norris, 15 and he got it.

45:15.319 --> 45:17.051
Now very important for miami

45:17.086 --> 45:18.735
If they see the opening and

45:18.770 --> 45:20.110
Break through the traffic,

45:20.145 --> 45:21.450
Just step in there and hit the

45:21.485 --> 45:23.749
Shots in this one.

45:23.784 --> 45:25.834
Outside the board and just

45:25.869 --> 45:27.626
Underway from the miami arena.

45:27.661 --> 45:29.384
Georgetown and the hurricanes.
