00:01.305 --> 00:02.959
Previously on
"Time After Time"...

00:03.003 --> 00:03.960
It's not right,
what we're doing.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.962
If you really feel
that way --

00:06.006 --> 00:07.007
Griffin!

00:07.050 --> 00:08.095
This is the book
that H.G. wrote.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.922
This is
"The Island of Dr. Moreau,"

00:09.966 --> 00:11.141
except
he changed the name.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.447
This is where you become
the key ingredient

00:12.490 --> 00:13.926
to Project Utopia.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.407
Leave me
the hell alone!Not a chance.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.844
You might be the key
to humanity's next step forward.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.672
What are you doing?

00:20.716 --> 00:22.152
We can't leave John.Goodbye, old friend.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.633
Stop this madness.
H.G.!

00:24.676 --> 00:26.678
H.G., no!
Come back here!

00:26.722 --> 00:28.376
What about John?
Did you see him?

00:28.419 --> 00:29.725
No,
I-I'm afraid I didn't.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.118
I've got the time machine.

00:31.161 --> 00:34.034
We can get off the island.
Come on.

00:36.645 --> 00:37.820
How did you
get off the island?

00:37.863 --> 00:40.823
I am going to burn you
like you burned me.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.912
Consider that myutopia.

00:42.955 --> 00:45.828
No, no, John, John. No!

00:45.871 --> 00:48.222
Uh, yes, Vanessa.
Your men are here.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.137
They took Doug.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.968
I am so very sorry.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.059
Thank you.

01:02.018 --> 01:05.152
Vanessa will be here
in a few hours.

01:05.195 --> 01:07.415
Where did Carl and Jones
take Doug's body?

01:07.458 --> 01:10.592
They didn't say, but Vanessa
has spoken with his family.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.811
I don't understand
any of it.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.465
How did John
get off the island?

01:14.509 --> 01:15.684
He must've found
the time machine

01:15.727 --> 01:17.338
and used it to get back
before we did.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.122
I helped him
on the island.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.472
Why would he
come back here?

01:21.516 --> 01:23.431
Why would he kill Doug?

01:23.474 --> 01:25.563
H.G., I think it's time
we call the police.

01:25.607 --> 01:28.479
The police?
And tell them what?

01:28.523 --> 01:30.351
That their Key Killer
is actually Jack the Ripper?

01:30.394 --> 01:31.961
Obviously we wouldn't
tell them everything.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.528
Well, we couldn't
tell them anything.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.182
We could tip them off.
They could arrest him.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.183
Yes, and then
he will tell them about

01:36.226 --> 01:37.488
you, me, and Vanessa.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.229
We can't let John
keep killing people.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.579
No, we can't.

01:44.365 --> 01:45.801
I have to end this myself.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.585
H.G., your hand
is still shaking.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.109
The serum is still
in your body.

01:49.152 --> 01:49.761
I am fine.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.198
You don't know that.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.590
You don't even know
what Monroe injected you with.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.157
We know enough.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.072
It's John's blood,
so I find it perfectly fitting,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.422
poetic in fact, that it
shall prove to be his undoing.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.815
Wait!
Where are you going?

01:59.858 --> 02:01.643
To find John
and to kill him.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.166
H.G., you're not yourself.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.081
Just, please,
wait a little bit.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.649
Give the serum
some time to wear off.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.391
This man --
He has to die.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.623
You seem a bit glum.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.104
One might think
you'd at least have

02:28.148 --> 02:30.150
a smile on your face
after that.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.197
Aren't you glad
I came back?

02:38.114 --> 02:41.813
It's just
a lot to process.

02:41.857 --> 02:45.687
Everything that you say
happened on that island --

02:45.730 --> 02:47.210
how it all went wrong.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.782
Did you kill my father?

02:56.524 --> 02:58.874
Doesn't history say
he perished in a fire?

03:08.275 --> 03:10.929
It does.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.758
Things are obviously very
different this time around.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.499
And without your father,

03:15.543 --> 03:17.588
I never would have made it
to the time machine.

03:20.548 --> 03:25.205
He saved my life,
and I regret that he lost his.

03:31.428 --> 03:34.257
See?

03:34.301 --> 03:35.563
I knew you two
would get along.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.045
We were like
two peas in a pod.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.442
He was quite fascinated
with my DNA.

03:46.922 --> 03:50.621
Speaking of which, the serum
that I brought back --

03:50.665 --> 03:52.623
I want to know more about it.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.846
So do I.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.978
Let's go see if it was
worth all the trouble.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.424
Meet William and Jeffrey --

04:10.467 --> 04:11.990
They're volunteers
from the farm.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.864
You have an endless supply
of giants.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.344
I need them
to test the serum

04:17.387 --> 04:19.041
that you brought back
from the island.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.782
I've combined it
with my own formula.

04:20.825 --> 04:23.219
My previous attempts
at recreating my father's work

04:23.263 --> 04:24.612
failed because
the drugs were too toxic

04:24.655 --> 04:25.917
for the human body
to handle.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.311
Your father tread
a similar ground,

04:28.355 --> 04:30.661
judging from what I saw
on the island.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.969
Some of his test subjects
were quite mad.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.624
Well, I believe it's
your DNA that's the key --

04:36.667 --> 04:38.669
your resistance to disease,
to mutation --

04:38.713 --> 04:40.976
that allows the body
to accept the drugs

04:41.019 --> 04:42.673
without any extreme
side effects.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.205
Your brother.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.338
He tried to help
Vanessa escape from the farm,

04:55.382 --> 04:57.384
so I shot him.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.212
But I managed to
remove the bullet

05:00.256 --> 05:01.779
and keep him alive.

05:01.823 --> 05:02.911
Why bother?

05:02.954 --> 05:04.826
The man betrayed you.

05:04.869 --> 05:08.220
Griffin is my family.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.005
You went all the way
back to 1918

05:10.048 --> 05:11.876
to try to
save your son.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.748
I can be sentimental, too.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.968
You think this new serum
will heal him?

05:17.012 --> 05:19.580
If it does,
it'll change

05:19.623 --> 05:21.886
everythingwe know
about medicine.

05:22.887 --> 05:26.326
My father will be vindicated,
my own research lauded.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.763
I'll be everything
my father should have been.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.765
So, it's power you want.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.419
I thought it was good,
old-fashioned revenge

05:32.462 --> 05:33.245
that kept you going.

05:33.289 --> 05:36.597
Power is revenge.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.902
There are many ways
of destroying people

05:37.946 --> 05:39.251
besides killing them.

05:41.428 --> 05:44.082
How long until we know
if it works?

05:44.126 --> 05:45.649
Maybe a couple of hours.

05:45.693 --> 05:48.086
I'm sure I can find
a way to occupy myself.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.741
Now, don't go
doing anything stupid.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.527
Not now --
Not when we're this close.

05:53.570 --> 05:57.095
Please, just
forget about Wells.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.576
Let it go.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.971
We're about to have
everything, John --

06:03.014 --> 06:07.410
power, acclaim,

06:07.454 --> 06:10.805
more money than you
could ever imagine.

06:10.848 --> 06:14.374
Now, isn't that a better future
than being "Jack the Ripper?"

06:20.597 --> 06:24.688
The man left me to die
on that island.

06:24.732 --> 06:29.867
Don't you ever, ever tell me
to let it go.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.693
Vanessa, I'm so sorry
about Doug.

07:12.736 --> 07:13.868
Me, too.

07:17.045 --> 07:19.613
I'm glad you're safe.
I was so worried.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.831
This has gone too far.

07:20.875 --> 07:24.139
I know.

07:24.182 --> 07:25.357
Where's the time machine?

07:25.401 --> 07:26.489
It's in the ballroom.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.491
H.G. took it offline
and shut it down.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.536
No one can take it.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.668
Good. And H.G.?

07:31.712 --> 07:33.931
He went to go find John.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.367
He took Doug's gun
with him.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.504
H.G. told me he was injected
with some kind of serum.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.028
Monroe made a serum
out of John's DNA

07:44.072 --> 07:45.813
that he injected
into H.G.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.685
It hasn't worn off,
and he hasn't been himself.

07:48.729 --> 07:51.122
What do you mean?The serum makes him angry.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.472
He can't control himself,

07:52.515 --> 07:54.822
and I'm worried that
he might actually kill John.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.653
Would that be
such a bad thing?

07:59.696 --> 08:02.046
H.G. is not a killer.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.919
He shouldn't have to live
with John's blood on his hands.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.268
Right now, he's living with

08:06.311 --> 08:09.532
a lot of other people's
blood on his hands.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.012
And so am I.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.448
Brooke's vendetta
against my family

08:12.492 --> 08:14.624
is responsible
for so much of this.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.887
I've got to get her to stop
this insane need for revenge.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.716
How?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.022
I may have a way.

08:48.484 --> 08:51.705
♪♪

09:12.769 --> 09:15.859
Not very subtle,
are you?

09:15.903 --> 09:19.602
I wasn't trying to be.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.473
We've been here before, H.G.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.866
You can't shoot me.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.999
I'm not myself, John.
You know that.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.784
I've got a killer's blood
coursing through my veins.

09:27.828 --> 09:30.352
Come on.
Pull the trigger.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.223
Come on.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.449
Well, it seems the serum
does wear off after all.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.016
Pity, that -- You were
just getting interesting.

09:44.235 --> 09:49.023
Now, I promised to show you how
vile this world can really be.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.460
You're not the only one
who can write stories.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.331
I'd like to write
a book on my own --

09:53.375 --> 09:55.072
"My Utopia"
by John Stevenson.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.900
You're talking nonsense.Am I?

09:56.944 --> 09:59.555
I plan to use your books
as my inspiration.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.339
And you'll get
all the credit for it.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.646
I'm going to create
such a story

10:03.690 --> 10:06.649
that when people hear
the name "H.G. Wells,"

10:06.693 --> 10:09.565
they'll only think of violence,
chaos, and death.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.001
And how do you plan
to do that?

10:11.045 --> 10:15.005
I'm going to
destroy your legacy.

10:15.049 --> 10:18.139
Get ready --
Chapter one begins today.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.845
You followed John back
from Brooke's apartment?

10:28.889 --> 10:30.281
Why would he
go back there?

10:30.325 --> 10:31.674
She's the one who sent him
to the island.

10:31.718 --> 10:32.806
He must need her
for something.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.546
Or she needs him.

10:34.590 --> 10:37.941
Either way,
they're the perfect couple.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.858
Well, I'm glad
you didn't kill him.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.774
I couldn't.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.907
The serum wore off.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.257
How do you know
for sure?

10:49.300 --> 10:52.086
My head isn't cloudy, and
the intense rage isn't there.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.610
I feel like myself.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.047
Don't get me wrong --
the man deserves to die.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.875
You don't want that
on your conscience.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.096
It's not who you are.

11:02.139 --> 11:05.186
It's not the man I love.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.499
Jane...

11:16.023 --> 11:18.765
I did some things
on the island.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.289
We all did things.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.117
We were trying to survive.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.163
Yes, but, uh...

11:26.207 --> 11:28.383
some of it, uh...

11:30.733 --> 11:32.300
Um...

11:32.343 --> 11:34.998
What is it?

11:35.042 --> 11:36.957
You can tell me.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.397
The reason
John is so angry...

11:42.440 --> 11:46.314
He blames me
for leaving him behind.

11:46.357 --> 11:49.273
You looked for him.
What more could you have done?

11:51.058 --> 11:52.537
Now he intends
to punish me.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.061
Did he tell you how?

11:54.104 --> 11:56.324
He's going to kill people
to destroy my legacy.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.154
And if he plans
to cause chaos as he says,

12:00.197 --> 12:02.286
then he'll go somewhere public
to make the biggest impact.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.853
He spoke of my books.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.376
A library?
Museum exhibit, maybe?

12:05.420 --> 12:06.551
Yeah, that's a start.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.125
Vanessa.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.214
I didn't think
you'd actually show up.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.650
I felt it was important
that we talk.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.740
Please, do come in.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.795
Clearly you chose not to
involve the authorities.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.057
What would I tell them?

12:34.101 --> 12:35.667
I don't think there's
a version of this story

12:35.711 --> 12:38.018
that would be believed.
Do you?

12:38.061 --> 12:39.323
Why are you here,
Vanessa?

12:39.367 --> 12:41.108
I want to end this,
Brooke.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.631
Whatever happened
between our parents --

12:42.674 --> 12:45.547
I want our battle to stop
right here, right now.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.157
You can't change the past,
Vanessa.

12:47.201 --> 12:50.421
We both know that now,
don't we?

12:50.465 --> 12:54.208
Well, I can change
the future.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.253
More importantly,
yourfuture.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.690
I will ensure that
your father's name

12:58.734 --> 13:00.475
is restored
in the scientific community.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.781
I will also
publicly acknowledge

13:01.824 --> 13:03.304
that your father
was the true visionary

13:03.347 --> 13:04.914
behind Anders Enterprises.

13:04.958 --> 13:08.875
And in restitution,
I will give you $100 million.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.006
What's the catch?

13:10.050 --> 13:12.008
There's no catch.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.445
You take the money
and move on,

13:14.489 --> 13:16.752
forget everything
that happened,

13:16.796 --> 13:17.971
and leave each other alone.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.845
Not interested.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.674
And, frankly,
rather insulted.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.763
I'm giving you everything
that you want.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.983
You could never give me
what I truly want.

13:30.026 --> 13:33.116
And as for the money and the
respect, I can get that myself.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.814
You're making a mistake.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.032
Go home, Vanessa.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.773
In a few days,
you'll realize

13:37.817 --> 13:39.731
how ridiculous
your little bribe truly is.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.265
Are all these
articles about me?

13:51.308 --> 13:53.702
Yep. Some literary criticism,
biographies,

13:53.745 --> 13:55.791
a bunch of fan clubs
John could be targeting.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.662
I'm gonna make some calls.
It might be faster.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.317
Please. I doubt
we have much time.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.289
Hi. I was wondering if...

14:25.473 --> 14:26.778
I left some messages,
but --

14:26.822 --> 14:28.737
H.G.?

14:34.351 --> 14:36.397
♪♪

14:42.403 --> 14:43.883
Hello.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.757
Hi!
Here. Take one. Thanks.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.455
Enjoy the fair.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.980
-Here you go.
-No, I appreciate it.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.207
Interesting choice
of costume.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.948
This is no costume.

15:05.992 --> 15:10.083
I assure you, I am
indeed Jack the Ripper.

15:15.349 --> 15:18.047
I wasn't aware that the Ripper
was also an author.

15:18.091 --> 15:19.657
Well, not per se,

15:19.701 --> 15:22.486
but I amthe greatest literary
hero of all time --

15:22.530 --> 15:25.359
114 nonfiction books alone

15:25.402 --> 15:26.969
dedicated to
my reign of terror

15:27.013 --> 15:29.102
across the slums
of East London.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.973
Only the slums?

15:31.017 --> 15:33.410
Yes, my inquisitive man.

15:33.454 --> 15:37.153
You see, I had a particular
fancy for ladies of the night.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.461
You might say I had
some issues with women.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.811
Well, I can assure you
the Ripper's disdain

15:42.854 --> 15:45.770
was spread evenly
between the sexes.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.338
Allow me to tell you
the fascinating story

15:48.382 --> 15:51.951
of the infamous letter
of October the 16th, 1888,

15:51.994 --> 15:54.344
received by the
Whitechapel Vigilance Committee

15:54.388 --> 15:56.912
and written
by my very own hand.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.436
Again, I can assure you
no such letter was written.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.177
Aha, but you are wrong, sir.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.614
You see, the letter
was sent in a small box

16:03.658 --> 16:05.573
along with part
of a human kidney.

16:05.616 --> 16:08.097
My most recent victim
was Catherine Eddowes,

16:08.141 --> 16:10.708
and when her body
was discovered,

16:10.752 --> 16:14.103
her kidney had indeed
been removed.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.239
It wasn't
Miss Eddowes' kidney.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.380
Thank you
for all your insights.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.861
Hey, man. Yeah. Anytime.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.690
And you can say

16:35.733 --> 16:40.216
you survived meeting
Jack the Ripper.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.969
Remarkable.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.755
Brooke.

16:57.799 --> 17:00.062
Welcome back.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.891
It's healed you faster
than I even thought possible.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.067
How do you feel?

17:05.111 --> 17:06.721
Like I got run over
by a truck.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.245
No, don't. Your body's
still processing the serum.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.856
Serum?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.380
What did you give me?

17:13.423 --> 17:16.513
Think of it
as a gift from Daddy

17:16.557 --> 17:17.949
almost 40 years
in the making.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.517
Dad?

17:23.651 --> 17:26.349
The farmhouse.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.481
Where's Vanessa?

17:29.265 --> 17:31.572
Don't worry. The princess
is back in her castle.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.356
You were gonna kill her.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.879
You shot me.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.098
I was angry.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.578
You shot me.

17:40.015 --> 17:43.323
I thought we could
change the past.

17:43.366 --> 17:46.804
If we had, then none of this
would have happened.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.329
Our entire lives
would have been rewritten.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.766
But nothing changed.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.552
No.

17:55.596 --> 17:58.468
You're telling me after
everything we went through...

18:00.209 --> 18:02.168
...we didn't change
anything?

18:02.211 --> 18:04.257
Griffin, I'm...

18:04.300 --> 18:06.172
I'm so sorry.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.870
I tried so hard.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.876
But we still have
each other.

18:14.919 --> 18:19.315
You and me --
that didn't change.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.361
And -- And it's never
going to.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.194
You get some rest.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.719
You've had
a tough road back.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.817
♪♪

18:42.860 --> 18:45.036
Ohh!
You -- You scared me.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.952
- Mars.
- Yes.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.824
I don't suppose
you could tell me

18:49.867 --> 18:52.174
where one might find
books by H.G. Wells?

18:52.218 --> 18:54.872
Oh, yeah.
Well, we've got them all.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.274
My God.
The man wrote a lot.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.971
He was very prolific --

19:07.015 --> 19:09.191
one of the first
science-fiction writers.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.107
"The Invisible Man."

19:12.151 --> 19:14.283
He commits murders
right under people's noses

19:14.327 --> 19:16.677
without them ever realizing
he was there.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.201
It's a cautionary tale
of moral corruption

19:19.245 --> 19:21.682
in the absence
of social restrictions.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.118
Sounds like
my cup of tea.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.120
The movie's even better.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.383
There's actually
an H.G. Wells marathon

19:27.427 --> 19:28.732
tonight
at the Gabrielle Cinema.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.386
You should come.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.432
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

19:55.455 --> 19:56.891
Hello?

19:56.934 --> 19:58.806
What took you so long?
I've been waiting.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.200
Whatever you're
planning on doing, don't.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.986
I'm just catching up
on some light reading.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.901
What do you mean?

20:06.944 --> 20:10.165
Yours is a prolific
canon of work --

20:10.209 --> 20:12.776
"The Time Machine,"
"The Island of Dr. Moreau."

20:12.820 --> 20:16.258
Now, tell me, which one of your characters is inspired by me?

20:16.302 --> 20:17.868
Oh, I doubt
any of them are.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.522
Well, let's change that,
then, shall we?

20:19.566 --> 20:22.046
What are you doing?

20:22.090 --> 20:24.614
Before I destroy
your life...

20:24.658 --> 20:27.182
I need to change mine.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.142
The Ripper's gone, H.G.
I've shed my skin.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.457
--Pardon me.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.070
No, no, no, no, no.

20:54.165 --> 20:57.647
-Move, move!
-Wait, wait, wait!

20:57.691 --> 20:59.345
It wasn't me.
Look, this is a mistake.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.085
53-82. Requesting backup.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.870
Got a person of interest.I didn't have anything
to do with this.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.306
-You're coming with me.
-No, no. Please.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.220
-This is a misunderstanding.
-Keep moving. Come on.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.352
This -- I --

21:08.354 --> 21:09.659
Wait there, John.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.182
Don't come any closer.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.576
This happens to be
a very nasty strain of MRSA --

21:13.620 --> 21:15.317
a staph bacterium.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.972
Causes a deadly,
flesh-eating skin infection.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.321
It also happens
to be resistant

21:19.365 --> 21:21.671
to all existing
antibiotic cures.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.978
Good God, woman.

21:24.021 --> 21:27.068
How else are we supposed to find
out if your DNA is the answer?

21:28.504 --> 21:31.115
Also, I saw the news.

21:31.159 --> 21:35.424
It seems you killed one of your
biggest fans at a book fair.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.339
Really?

21:37.383 --> 21:39.689
I saw it
as killing my past.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.866
Everyone has a cellphone.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.607
Everything ends up
on the Internet.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.566
You have to be
more careful.

21:46.609 --> 21:49.612
And if you really are intent
on bringing Wells down,

21:49.656 --> 21:52.572
then there has to be
a more subtle way.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.704
Well, I don't think
I need a lecture on subtlety

21:54.748 --> 21:56.489
from you, my dear.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.142
You missed a spot.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.497
This isn't Whitechapel.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.499
Forensic science
has come a long way.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.805
Take a shower.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.507
Tell me your name again.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.378
Wells, George Wells.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.424
-British citizen.
-That's correct.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.077
But no papers?

22:20.121 --> 22:22.428
I don't have them with me.

22:22.471 --> 22:25.648
You said, uh,
you don't know the killer.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.563
Did you know the victim?

22:27.607 --> 22:29.260
I'd never seen him before.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.524
He was dressed
as Jack the Ripper.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.352
Well, that's
kind of ironic.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.657
I suppose.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.398
So, the first time
you set eyes on the man

22:36.442 --> 22:39.053
was just after
he'd been stabbed?That's correct.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.968
And then you saw
a dark-haired man

22:41.011 --> 22:42.665
holding a knife
run into a crowd.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.843
So you think that this guy
was some sort of psychopath

22:46.887 --> 22:50.064
who stabbed a complete stranger
and took off?

22:50.107 --> 22:51.674
Precisely.

22:53.154 --> 22:55.678
That's an oddly specific
theory, George.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.508
We-Well, there was something
on the news just the other night

22:59.552 --> 23:01.684
about such random crimes,
the Key Killer.

23:01.728 --> 23:04.383
We didn't find any keys
on this victim.

23:04.426 --> 23:08.256
True, but the Key Killer
uses a knife, does he not?

23:15.568 --> 23:17.396
I've told you
everything that I know.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.659
Am -- Am I allowed to go?

23:19.702 --> 23:22.270
Actually...

23:22.313 --> 23:26.753
I'd love it if you'd just
sit tight for a while.

24:39.565 --> 24:42.481
Sorry, pal.
This is gonna be ugly.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.802
Griffin?

25:26.612 --> 25:27.917
Ahh.

25:40.016 --> 25:42.889
This was all Griffin.
He escaped.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.892
And don't tell me.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.633
This is what I get
for being sentimental.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.635
Where do you think
he'll go?

25:49.678 --> 25:51.332
I have no idea.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.290
But clearly, he's not
gonna see things my way.

25:53.334 --> 25:56.250
Then perhaps we need
to forge new goals --

25:56.293 --> 25:59.514
new ambitions unclouded by
the disappointments of the past.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.821
I'm ready.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.780
But what are you
gonna do about Wells?

26:04.824 --> 26:07.478
I had a chapter two planned,

26:07.522 --> 26:10.525
but maybe I should just
jump to the end of the story.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.831
Meaning?

26:12.919 --> 26:15.443
It's time to kill Jane.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.887
Sorry to keep you waiting.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.288
What is this?

26:34.331 --> 26:36.072
This was taken
at the service entrance

26:36.116 --> 26:37.900
of a nightclub
called the Palace.

26:37.944 --> 26:39.336
We believe the Key Killer
was there

26:39.380 --> 26:41.469
the night that
this footage was recorded.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.645
Funny, you being in the park
for today's stabbing

26:43.689 --> 26:45.691
and now this, too.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.389
It's an unhappy
coincidence.

26:48.432 --> 26:50.434
Is the Palace a place
you like to frequent?

26:50.478 --> 26:51.653
No.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.136
I'm sorry. Detective,
are you trying to ascertain

26:56.179 --> 26:57.224
whether I am
the Key Killer?

26:57.267 --> 26:59.052
My only job
is to ask questions.

26:59.095 --> 27:01.010
Your only job
is to answer them.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.494
Hi, Detective.
Don't bother getting up.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.409
-George Wells?
-Yes?

27:08.452 --> 27:10.846
My name is Kal Vazquez.
I'm your attorney.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.327
Anders Enterprises.
Did Vanessa send you?

27:13.370 --> 27:15.721
Yes.
She's waiting downstairs.

27:15.764 --> 27:18.027
Now, unless you plan to charge
my client, we're done here.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.943
This is an active murder
investigation, Counselor.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.424
Is Mr. Wells a suspect?
Did any witnesses identify him?

27:23.467 --> 27:25.426
Did you find
the murder weapon on him?

27:25.469 --> 27:27.689
Is he in any way
linked to the victim?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.996
Yeah, I'm not releasing him
until I get some positive I.D.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.348
Here's his passport.
Anything else?

28:01.114 --> 28:02.724
Thank you.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.552
What time
is the last show?

28:04.595 --> 28:06.032
It just started.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.863
Thank you.

28:16.869 --> 28:19.523
You brought it on yourselves!

28:19.567 --> 28:20.655
Everything
would have come right

28:20.699 --> 28:22.744
if you'd only left me alone.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.703
You've driven me near madness

28:24.746 --> 28:27.096
with your peering
through the keyholes

28:27.140 --> 28:29.098
and gaping
through the curtains,

28:29.142 --> 28:31.361
and now you'll suffer for it!

28:31.405 --> 28:34.930
You're crazy to know who I am,
aren't you?!

28:34.974 --> 28:37.977
All right! I'll show you!

28:38.020 --> 28:41.371
There's a souvenir for you!

28:41.415 --> 28:43.634
And one for you!

28:43.678 --> 28:45.811
I'll show you who I am
and what I am!

28:50.206 --> 28:51.817
How do you like that, eh?!

28:57.692 --> 28:59.520
So, you want to tell me
what thatwas all about?

28:59.563 --> 29:02.262
I was...

29:02.305 --> 29:03.785
apprehended by police.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.787
Does that make you
a suspect?

29:06.962 --> 29:08.181
So it seems.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.966
Why did you run from me?

29:11.010 --> 29:12.533
It was too dangerous.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.926
Oh.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.579
We're back there again.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.756
No. Jane, there's something
you have to understand.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.149
John is in a state
such that I've never seen.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.369
He's more dangerous
than he has ever been.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.289
Hello, H.G.
And how are you this evening?

29:31.770 --> 29:32.814
Where are you, John?

29:32.858 --> 29:34.250
You won't believe this, H.G.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.252
Moving pictures --

29:36.296 --> 29:39.603
one of your stories being told
right before my very eyes.

29:39.647 --> 29:41.344
Now, I tried
to read your books,

29:41.388 --> 29:43.259
but they're quite dense
and, frankly, rather boring --

29:43.303 --> 29:44.957
Just a bit of
constructive criticism.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.046
He's at the movies.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.264
I mean --
I mean, seriously,

29:48.308 --> 29:49.700
ah, where else
did you come up

29:49.744 --> 29:51.485
with the idea
for an invisible man?

29:51.528 --> 29:54.793
It's just the most ridiculous
thing I've ever seen.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.533
Shh!

29:56.577 --> 29:58.231
Oh!Seriously?

29:58.274 --> 29:59.623
Terribly sorry.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.670
Are you
satisfied now, you fools?!

30:02.713 --> 30:04.237
Cheerio, poppet.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.891
I'm looking it up.

30:05.934 --> 30:07.893
I'm coming with you.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.198
-No, you're --
-No arguing.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.852
I have to try
and talk to him.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.376
And he won't listen to you,
Jane. The man is mad.

30:13.420 --> 30:16.597
But I can get through to him.
I have before.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.512
I have to try.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.080
Here it is --

30:21.123 --> 30:23.691
There's an H.G. Wells marathon
playing at the Gabrielle Cinema.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.867
"The Invisible Man" is playing.
That's where John is.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.434
Let's go.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.438
All right. Go now.

30:31.481 --> 30:33.527
If you raise a finger
against me, you're a dead man.

30:33.570 --> 30:37.183
I'm strong,
and I'll strangle you.

30:37.226 --> 30:40.316
Understand?
Wait for me downstairs.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.895
Sir, you can't
be back there.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.898
Sir, did you hear me?
Sir.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.971
Hello, there.

31:26.014 --> 31:27.537
Hey.
Uh, can I help you?

31:27.581 --> 31:30.627
Yes. I just curious to know
how film projection worked.

31:30.671 --> 31:31.977
This isn't a film school.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.717
You're not allowed up here.Right.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.430
Don't! Don't!

31:50.473 --> 31:52.693
How are you still alive?

31:52.736 --> 31:54.956
Brooke.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.218
She saved me.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.438
Then why are you here?

31:59.526 --> 32:00.744
I had to see you.

32:02.703 --> 32:05.575
I know you met
with Brooke.

32:05.619 --> 32:09.188
You cannot trust her, Vanessa.
I know my sister.

32:09.231 --> 32:10.841
No matter what she says,

32:10.885 --> 32:13.148
she will never stop blaming you
for what your family did.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.671
She has to, Griffin.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.717
John brought something
back from the island,

32:16.760 --> 32:20.025
some serum my father made
with John's DNA.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.852
What kind of serum?I don't know how,

32:21.896 --> 32:24.203
but it healed me,

32:24.246 --> 32:27.380
and I don't trust Brooke
with it.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.338
We have to stop her,
Vanessa!

32:32.385 --> 32:35.431
I know
it's too late for us,

32:35.475 --> 32:37.564
but I don't want
to see you get hurt.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.089
I just want to help...you.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.049
- Griffin?

32:45.180 --> 32:46.660
-What happened?
-I don't know.

32:46.703 --> 32:49.706
He needs help right away.
Let's get him upstairs.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.494
This is the place.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.937
They're closed.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.511
This one's unlocked.

33:46.981 --> 33:50.506
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

33:53.292 --> 33:55.381
How could he?

34:01.256 --> 34:04.390
Where is it coming from?

34:04.433 --> 34:06.174
Up there.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.025
H.G.?!

34:42.906 --> 34:44.952
Where are you?!

34:46.171 --> 34:48.477
Hello, Jane.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.522
Let go of me.

34:56.268 --> 34:57.921
Shh, shh. It's okay.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.752
Jane! John!

35:02.796 --> 35:05.668
And here we are, H.G.
One last time.

35:05.712 --> 35:08.106
-Don't do this, John.
-To be honest, I don't want to.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.846
I've grown rather fond
of Jane here.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.805
Then what do you want?

35:11.848 --> 35:13.328
You want to see me beg?

35:13.372 --> 35:16.418
Okay, I am begging you --
Please don't do this.

35:16.462 --> 35:17.854
What do you want?
You want the time machine?

35:17.898 --> 35:19.160
It's yours.
I'll give you the key.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.814
Goodness' sake. I don't
want the time machine.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.468
I want
to see you punished.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.078
Why?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.993
For what you did
on the island.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.168
We helped you.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.170
Yes, you did.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.346
But heleft me to die.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.478
We looked for you.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.349
And hefound me.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.618
Oh, you didn't know?

35:43.750 --> 35:45.360
I think it's time
for some truth telling, H.G.

35:45.404 --> 35:46.622
Don't you?

35:51.845 --> 35:56.023
Yes, I found you
on the island...

35:56.066 --> 35:57.285
and I left you to die.

35:58.721 --> 36:02.160
You tried
to burn me alive.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.641
Is that true?

36:12.082 --> 36:14.215
Seriously?
You didn't tell her?

36:14.259 --> 36:16.435
Huh.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.133
Well, that makes this
all the more difficult.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.830
Jane, I'm really sorry
to have to do this.

36:20.874 --> 36:23.311
No, no, don't! Stop, stop, stop!
John, don't do this.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.878
Look, if you want to
kill someone, kill me.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.532
I deserve this, not her.

36:26.575 --> 36:27.924
But killing Jane
willkill you, Wells.

36:27.968 --> 36:29.361
That's the point!

36:32.712 --> 36:34.844
I didn't know
how to tell you.

36:36.890 --> 36:39.458
Jane, I am so sorry.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.981
So, John, please?

36:42.548 --> 36:44.245
Please.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.639
I really don't want
to kill you, Jane,

36:46.682 --> 36:49.903
not after everything
we've been through.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.080
And...

36:53.123 --> 36:55.822
there areother ways
to destroy people.

36:59.478 --> 37:02.089
He lied to your face,

37:02.132 --> 37:04.874
and you were almost killed
because of it.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.313
How can you ever
trust him again?

37:15.320 --> 37:18.758
I think that just about kills
your little...

37:18.801 --> 37:20.586
love story.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.678
Till next time.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.784
I really thought
he was going to kill her.

37:44.827 --> 37:49.223
But he didn't.
Jane is safe.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.877
That's what you have to
concentrate on right now.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.706
And I can never let anything
like this ever happen again.

37:53.749 --> 37:56.099
It won't.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.537
We'll stop him.
Brooke, too.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.930
How?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.671
If Project Utopia
was able to save Griffin,

38:02.715 --> 38:04.456
then it's even more powerful
than we thought.

38:04.499 --> 38:08.373
Yes. It could change everything
we know about medicine.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.505
No wonder Brooke
didn't need my money.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.507
You believe she plans
to sell the serum?

38:12.551 --> 38:14.161
Absolutely.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.510
Vanessa, we cannot
let her do that.

38:15.554 --> 38:18.774
No, we can't.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.692
You're in a good mood.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.347
Did you kill Jane?

38:26.391 --> 38:29.916
Better -- I believe
I've just dealt H.G. a blow

38:29.959 --> 38:32.092
from which
he'll never recover.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.704
Do you need anything else,
Ms. Monroe?

38:35.748 --> 38:37.967
Oh, no, William.
You go home and get some rest.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.495
Well, he made
quite the recovery.

38:43.538 --> 38:44.844
The Project Utopia serum

38:44.887 --> 38:47.368
completely eradicated
the bacteria from his body.

38:47.412 --> 38:50.763
You do understand what
a medical breakthrough this is?

38:50.806 --> 38:54.288
This has the capacity to
completely change the world.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.378
Altruism is a side of you
I didn't quite anticipate.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.338
Savingthe world
doesn't interest me.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.252
I have other plans.

39:02.296 --> 39:04.994
There's the Brooke
I know.

39:07.388 --> 39:11.218
There's no limit to what
we can do with this...

39:12.872 --> 39:16.179
...if you learn to control your
extracurricular activities.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.053
I'll work on it.

39:27.147 --> 39:28.714
For those of you
just joining us,

39:28.757 --> 39:30.411
late this evening,
three employees

39:30.455 --> 39:32.021
were found stabbed to death

39:32.065 --> 39:34.241
after an H.G. Wells
movie marathon

39:34.284 --> 39:36.112
at the Gabrielle Cinema
downtown.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.245
Police are investigating
and have not ruled out

39:38.288 --> 39:40.290
the possibility
that the Key Killer

39:40.334 --> 39:42.467
may be responsible
for the murders.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.139
There you are.
I was looking for you.

40:10.059 --> 40:13.149
I think it's time
for me to go home...

40:13.193 --> 40:14.281
back to my apartment.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.849
Why?

40:20.722 --> 40:22.855
I don't know
how to say this.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.336
I just can't.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.600
I can't do this anymore.

40:28.643 --> 40:31.167
What do you mean?

40:31.211 --> 40:33.518
I'm just a girl
who works at a museum.

40:35.694 --> 40:39.872
All this craziness --
It's too much.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.616
I don't like
who I'm becoming...

40:44.659 --> 40:46.356
who you're becoming.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.749
Jane, I'm sorry
I lied to you

40:47.793 --> 40:49.185
about what happened
on the island,

40:49.229 --> 40:51.274
but I was under
the influence of this serum.

40:51.318 --> 40:53.929
I wasn't myself.It's -- It's more than that.

40:53.973 --> 40:57.367
All around me,
people are dying.

40:59.718 --> 41:03.069
Martin, Doug...

41:03.112 --> 41:05.245
the people
at the movie theater.

41:06.855 --> 41:10.990
So much death, and we keep
going on like nothing happened.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.426
That is not
who we are, Jane.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.993
And that's the lie.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.864
Because here we are.

41:15.908 --> 41:20.521
I'm trying to rationalize
my part in all of this,

41:20.565 --> 41:21.914
and I can't.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.790
So the only thing
left for me to do is...

41:31.097 --> 41:34.056
...is just not
be a part of it.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.058
Jane.

41:37.669 --> 41:40.019
I really do love you.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.589
I'm sorry.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.854
Goodbye, H.G.
