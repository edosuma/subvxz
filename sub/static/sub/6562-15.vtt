21:02.910 --> 21:05.670
Kendall, you and I tried
that already, and we failed.

That's not what
I'm using it for.

great projects here.

By keeping Jett tied up and away

21:59.710 --> 22:03.700
immediately cut the Palm
Woods' power usage by 22%.

gallons of water per year.

You know, when
you think about it,

the whole thing was my idea, so
I should talk to the governor.
