00:00.310 --> 00:04.395
- You cannot write articles about
Hollis Doyle. - Watch me.

00:04.429 --> 00:06.179
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:06.197 --> 00:07.014
My problems are your problems.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.499
Put your wife on a leash.

00:08.533 --> 00:10.968
- I'm worried for James.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:11.019 --> 00:12.970
Tell me what you need,
and I will do it.

00:13.021 --> 00:14.305
Abby and David
can't be together.

00:14.356 --> 00:16.056
I can't tell you why,
but they can't.

00:16.091 --> 00:18.092
Her ex-husband used to beat her.
You might want to use that.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.410
Consider it handled.

00:19.444 --> 00:21.862
Hospital photos of
Teresa Dunn's injuries.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.949
I didn't touch her.
You look like a good guy, but you're not!

00:29.004 --> 00:30.204
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

00:30.722 --> 00:32.104
There was Shayna.

00:32.140 --> 00:32.857
She was an artist.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.759
We dated for five months,
but she didn't like to read.

00:35.793 --> 00:37.077
That was an actual thing
she said...

00:37.095 --> 00:39.446
"I don't like to read,"
as if that is okay.

00:40.180 --> 00:41.898
So after her,
I dated Maggie.

00:41.949 --> 00:45.234
She loved to read. She did not,
however, love to be monogamous.

00:45.286 --> 00:46.536
Then there was Paulette.

00:46.570 --> 00:47.671
Edison, you've made your point.

00:47.705 --> 00:49.656
Have I? Because I still
haven't heard a single detail

00:49.674 --> 00:51.358
about the men that you've
dated since we broke up.

00:51.392 --> 00:52.492
There's nothing to tell.

00:52.493 --> 00:54.227
Because you're so ugly
no one wants to be with you.

00:54.261 --> 00:55.795
Because there's nothing to tell.

00:55.829 --> 00:58.264
You won't be seen in public with
me. What am I supposed to think?

00:58.298 --> 00:59.999
That every reporter knows
my face, and it would

01:00.034 --> 01:02.552
become a story that you're
dating a professional fixer.

01:02.603 --> 01:05.471
You're a United States senator.
The focus should be on you.

01:05.506 --> 01:06.606
What was his name?

01:06.640 --> 01:07.607
Edison.

01:07.641 --> 01:09.125
Normal people talk.
They share.

01:09.276 --> 01:11.176
That is how a relationship works.

01:12.595 --> 01:14.379
Okay. You want me
to tell you something?

01:14.397 --> 01:15.864
Fine.
But it's between us,

01:15.915 --> 01:17.900
and if I tell you, you can't
ask any questions. Are you in?

01:17.934 --> 01:19.385
I'm in.

01:19.419 --> 01:22.004
When something big happens
in the senate today,

01:22.038 --> 01:23.222
you should be one of
the first senators

01:23.256 --> 01:24.523
to make a statement of support.

01:24.557 --> 01:25.741
What?

01:25.792 --> 01:27.860
When something big happens
in the senate today,

01:27.894 --> 01:29.694
you should be one of
the first senators

01:29.713 --> 01:31.713
to make a statement of support.

01:31.764 --> 01:32.798
This is you sharing?

01:34.300 --> 01:36.918
Whoever he was, he really
hurt you, didn't he?

01:36.969 --> 01:40.439
(Cell phone rings)

01:40.473 --> 01:41.390
(Ring)

01:41.424 --> 01:43.525
(Ring)

01:44.159 --> 01:47.245
Harrison. You're gonna
have to handle it.

01:47.279 --> 01:49.030
You can handle incoming.

01:49.081 --> 01:51.149
- I have that other meeting,
and I'm late. - Wait.

01:51.183 --> 01:52.400
Statement of support.

01:52.434 --> 01:54.402
We haven't finished
talking about this.

01:54.436 --> 01:57.238
You're probably not even
listening to my messages

01:57.273 --> 02:00.074
anymore, Abby,
but I miss you a lot.

02:00.109 --> 02:01.776
And I know I keep saying this,

02:01.827 --> 02:04.929
but that whole Teresa Dunn
thing is a complete lie,

02:04.964 --> 02:07.832
and I'm gonna prove it
to you, and when...

02:07.866 --> 02:11.152
Uh, I gotta go.
It's a lie, Abby.

02:11.903 --> 02:12.987
David Rosen?

02:13.021 --> 02:14.388
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

02:17.041 --> 02:19.093
All right.
Shall we, uh...

02:19.127 --> 02:20.911
What are you doing?
Don't read it here.

02:20.945 --> 02:22.062
I like to see
what I'm getting.

02:22.097 --> 02:24.264
Hollis Doyle wants
to build a pipeline

02:24.299 --> 02:26.600
through the middle of this
country, but it's a tough sell

02:26.634 --> 02:27.985
with N.I.M.B.Y.S
and environmentalists.

02:28.019 --> 02:30.120
How's he do it?
He rigs the voting.

02:30.155 --> 02:32.006
Every single ballot measure

02:32.057 --> 02:33.674
in favor of the pipeline
won in the last election.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.509
You're saying he rigged
the voting machines

02:35.543 --> 02:36.860
- in all these states?
- It sounded crazy to me, too,

02:36.895 --> 02:40.097
until I got a look
at all this stuff.

02:40.931 --> 02:42.382
No. I don't think so.

02:42.416 --> 02:43.967
What?
You barely looked at it.

02:44.001 --> 02:45.018
You know how many
conspiracy theorists

02:45.052 --> 02:46.586
bombard me with nonsense every week?

02:46.620 --> 02:48.004
I should've known when
you asked to meet me

02:48.022 --> 02:48.923
at a national monument.

02:48.957 --> 02:51.257
Don't treat me like I'm crazy.
I don't have an axe to grind.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.025
I don't believe 9/11
was an inside job

02:53.060 --> 02:54.927
or the phone company
killed J.F.K.

02:54.961 --> 02:56.629
I'm just a damn good lawyer
who stumbled onto something

02:56.663 --> 02:59.265
I can no longer pursue
without losing the job I love.

02:59.299 --> 03:01.434
So please,
just take a look at it.

03:04.805 --> 03:06.539
<i>At the end of the previous</i>
<i>quarter, the board considered,</i>

03:06.573 --> 03:08.808
<i>but did not make a decision</i>
<i>regarding, using cash...</i>

03:08.842 --> 03:11.010
That's my father,
Harold Pierce, Sr.

03:11.044 --> 03:12.111
He doesn't look crazy to me.

03:12.145 --> 03:13.512
That was a year ago.

03:13.547 --> 03:16.549
<i>(Motorcycle engine revving)</i>

03:18.552 --> 03:20.519
<i>Ooh! Ee!</i>

03:23.690 --> 03:26.926

Sync and corrections by bellows

03:34.701 --> 03:36.701
That is the day
before yesterday.

03:36.736 --> 03:38.403
One of our servants sent it to us.

03:38.437 --> 03:40.705
And that was before he told
them all to, and I quote,

03:40.740 --> 03:41.907
"get out and go to hell."

03:41.941 --> 03:43.575
As you can see, my husband is

03:43.610 --> 03:45.977
clearly suffering from
some kind of psychotic break.

03:46.012 --> 03:48.380
- Mom.
- My ex-husband.

03:48.414 --> 03:50.115
(Clicking) Harold Pierce
dropped out of tenth grade

03:50.149 --> 03:51.816
to help his family
after his father died,

03:51.851 --> 03:53.485
sold radios door-to-door
throughout the lower midwest.

03:53.519 --> 03:54.586
Is that how
he made his fortune?

03:54.620 --> 03:56.021
The lowest figures
in the sales force.

03:56.055 --> 03:57.456
Couldn't bear take the money
from the down-and-outs,

03:57.490 --> 03:59.491
so he spent most of his house
calls fixing people's radios.

03:59.525 --> 04:00.992
Toying around, figured
out a better device

04:01.027 --> 04:02.561
to find radio signals
further away...

04:02.595 --> 04:04.029
A chip that became the basis

04:04.063 --> 04:05.497
for what's in every cell phone today.

04:05.531 --> 04:06.932
Your divorce was recent.

04:06.966 --> 04:08.600
Just last month,
out of the blue.

04:08.634 --> 04:09.601
Was it amicable?

04:09.635 --> 04:11.536
Oh.
He was more than fair.

04:11.571 --> 04:13.038
That's the problem.

04:13.072 --> 04:15.207
He gave me $500 million

04:15.241 --> 04:18.243
without complaint, with a smile.
That is not like him.

04:18.293 --> 04:19.611
Married his high school
sweetheart, had two kids,

04:19.644 --> 04:21.296
and spent the next 40 years
building an empire.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.031
His son Skip started
in the mail room,

04:23.065 --> 04:24.033
worked his way up
to a corner office.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.718
His new girlfriend Jenna
became a fixture

04:25.769 --> 04:26.636
on the Hollywood club scene.

04:26.670 --> 04:29.187
She had a reality show,
but only for one season, sadly.

04:31.157 --> 04:33.275
Well, it was flawed,
but highly addictive.

04:33.309 --> 04:36.361
What kind of man quits his work,
takes up with some bimbo,

04:36.412 --> 04:37.746
and then walks away
from his own family

04:37.780 --> 04:39.581
without so much as a look back?
I mean, who does that?

04:39.616 --> 04:41.316
And with all due respect,
if your dad wants to have

04:41.334 --> 04:42.701
a midlife crisis, I'm not sure

04:42.752 --> 04:43.869
what Pope and Associates
can do about it.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.256
If my dad was just my dad, he'd
be free to do whatever he wants.

04:47.290 --> 04:48.423
But he's not.
He's the face

04:48.458 --> 04:50.008
of a multibillion-dollar
business empire.

04:50.043 --> 04:52.160
That just happens to be having
an I.P.O. in three days.

04:52.178 --> 04:53.662
Have you crunched
the numbers?

04:53.680 --> 04:55.163
It's estimated that Pierce
Industries is worth

04:55.181 --> 04:57.049
about $35 billion,
which sounds impressive,

04:57.100 --> 04:58.183
until you realize
that going public...

04:58.218 --> 04:59.351
We're talking somewhere

04:59.385 --> 05:00.835
in the hundreds of
billions of dollars.

05:00.854 --> 05:02.771
Unless the world learns
he's lost his marbles.

05:02.805 --> 05:04.556
Remember the insterstellar I.P.O.?

05:04.607 --> 05:06.225
Press discovered sexual
harassment charges

05:06.276 --> 05:08.026
were filed against
the founder and C.E.O.

05:08.061 --> 05:09.177
The stock was offered at 70,

05:09.195 --> 05:10.863
end of the week...
Between 4 and 5 bucks.

05:10.897 --> 05:12.865
We're just worried
that the eccentricities

05:12.899 --> 05:14.616
he's been displaying lately

05:14.651 --> 05:17.286
will get out to the
financial press or worse.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.239
He could show up on the trading
floor and make a scene.

05:20.290 --> 05:21.573
You want us to help you
get through the I.P.O.

05:21.608 --> 05:23.692
and take the company public
without incident.

05:23.710 --> 05:26.044
The Harold Pierce we know would
expect us to do nothing less.

05:26.079 --> 05:28.080
So how do we keep him
from ruining his legacy,

05:28.131 --> 05:30.549
from throwing 40 years
of work down the drain?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.467
(Laptop keys clicking)

05:32.502 --> 05:35.554
If we could prove
he's not in his right mind...

05:35.588 --> 05:37.372
- We can get him committed.
- Involuntarily.

05:37.390 --> 05:39.308
If we can get a court to give
Skip legal guardianship...

05:39.342 --> 05:41.727
Got us some ammunition.
Let's go to work, people.

05:41.861 --> 05:44.312
- People?
- I'm lead on this.

05:44.330 --> 05:45.747
Oh, lead. Cool.

05:45.782 --> 05:46.981
(Chuckles) Supercool.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.583
All right, let's hop to.

05:48.618 --> 05:50.318
Don't say "people."

05:50.336 --> 05:52.037
- Team.
- Better.

05:52.088 --> 05:53.522
(Chuckles)

05:53.523 --> 05:54.940
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

05:54.991 --> 05:57.659
What if I go to rehab,
say I'm a sex addict?

05:57.694 --> 05:59.828
In 60 seconds, you're gonna
walk out to that podium,

05:59.862 --> 06:01.063
read the statement
in front of you,

06:01.097 --> 06:03.265
and resign the majority
leadership position.

06:03.299 --> 06:04.566
But this could all blow over.
What if...

06:04.634 --> 06:06.351
You had sex <i>way</i> more
than the public knows about

06:06.386 --> 06:07.703
with a 21-year-old intern...

06:07.737 --> 06:09.571
The daughter of one
of your wife's best friends.

06:09.589 --> 06:11.690
She was not that innocent
in this, believe me.

06:11.724 --> 06:13.841
- Let me tell you, these young
girls, they... - 40 seconds.

06:13.975 --> 06:15.243
Look at me.
(Sighs)

06:15.277 --> 06:17.512
This is over. You have
no support within your party.

06:17.546 --> 06:18.763
Zero.

06:18.797 --> 06:21.049
You walk out there, read
the statement I wrote for you,

06:21.083 --> 06:23.001
you get to remain
a U.S. senator.

06:23.635 --> 06:25.820
(Sighs)
This is really happening.

06:25.854 --> 06:28.572
It is, and it's happening
to your family,

06:28.607 --> 06:30.507
your staff, your friends.

06:30.542 --> 06:32.509
All any of them want
to hear right now is

06:32.544 --> 06:34.745
how profoundly sorry you are,

06:34.779 --> 06:35.580
how ashamed you are,

06:35.631 --> 06:38.015
and how you're going to work
to regain their respect

06:38.066 --> 06:39.450
and their trust.

06:39.501 --> 06:40.935
Okay.

06:40.969 --> 06:42.002
Ready?

06:42.037 --> 06:44.355
(Exhales deeply)
Ready.

06:44.389 --> 06:47.274
(Reporters shouting at once,
camera shutters clicking)

06:50.862 --> 06:52.496
I have apologized personally

06:52.530 --> 06:54.281
to the young woman
and her family...

06:54.316 --> 06:56.983
Governor Carmichael needs to be
called. It has to be personal.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.151
Maybe ask him about his kid.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.686
I think he has
cerebral palsy.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.437
You got the joint chiefs
for 20 minutes.

07:01.472 --> 07:03.940
I have two briefings on East
Sudan you should be in.

07:03.974 --> 07:06.542
We need to talk about
that budget committee thing

07:06.577 --> 07:07.677
and how you want
to play that.

07:07.711 --> 07:09.012
The chancellor of Germany

07:09.063 --> 07:11.714
made an idiotic remark
about the holocaust,

07:11.749 --> 07:13.032
and so I need you to call him

07:13.067 --> 07:14.350
and slap him down
without starting a war.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.253
Apparently, the Yangtze river
in China turned red

07:17.304 --> 07:18.604
a few months ago...

07:18.638 --> 07:20.340
(Voice echoing)
And religious leaders are asking

07:20.374 --> 07:23.710
if you think it's the apocalypse
or just, you know, dirty water.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.562
I wrote you a thing
that insults neither Jesus

07:26.613 --> 07:28.715
or the ability of the Chinese
to clean their rivers.

07:28.749 --> 07:33.486
Oh, we need to discuss
the military options for the...

07:33.904 --> 07:35.871
(Normal voice)
Mr. president?

07:35.906 --> 07:39.992
<i>I would like to thank</i>
<i>my colleagues and my St...</i>

07:42.244 --> 07:44.345
That's not an easy thing
to recover from.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.597
Painful.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.031
It's gonna take some
time to get over it.

07:47.065 --> 07:50.101
The senator's actions were
a blow to the country.

07:50.135 --> 07:51.402
Wasn't talking
about the senator,

07:51.437 --> 07:53.070
but let's all be
W.A.S.P.S about this

07:53.088 --> 07:54.339
and pretend that I was.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.891
Let's.

07:58.127 --> 07:59.611
You're back.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.262
(Door closes) You knew I was
coming back this morning.

08:01.297 --> 08:02.580
You've been gone three weeks.
Not one phone call.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.048
I was starting to think
you were dead.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.483
I mean, I knew you weren't
because I saw you on the news,

08:06.501 --> 08:07.635
but a girl can dream.

08:08.769 --> 08:09.687
How's the baby?

08:09.721 --> 08:11.655
- Still in here.
- Mellie.

08:11.689 --> 08:13.340
The baby is fine.
I am 32 weeks along.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.125
He is healthy.
I have not harmed your child.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.577
I never said...

08:16.611 --> 08:19.396
Cyrus, I finalized my end
of the guest list for the gala,

08:19.431 --> 08:20.631
but I need you to take a look

08:20.649 --> 08:21.916
- and see if it plays out on your end.
- What? Wait.

08:21.950 --> 08:23.384
I have removed senator Schumann
entirely, which is fine,

08:23.418 --> 08:25.919
because I never liked his wife.
Apparently, neither did he.

08:25.954 --> 08:26.987
What gala?

08:27.021 --> 08:27.972
For your birthday.

08:28.906 --> 08:30.674
I thought I said
I didn't want a big party.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.976
We can't always get
what we want, can we?

08:36.447 --> 08:37.864
(Door closes)
You're having a private party.

08:37.914 --> 08:40.183
Just a few friends
in the residence tonight.

08:40.217 --> 08:43.553
Then a couple of nights later,
500 people, 4 world leaders,

08:43.587 --> 08:45.822
Stevie wonder's going to sing.
It'll be fine.

08:45.956 --> 08:47.456
Happy Birthday, sir.

08:47.474 --> 08:50.192
Yeah.
(Door closes)

08:50.226 --> 08:51.694
And these proceedings are being
brought by the wife?

08:51.712 --> 08:53.196
Mr. Pierce's son.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.597
We're seeking this court to deem
Harold Pierce incapacitated

08:54.631 --> 08:55.748
and make Skip his legal guardian.

08:55.783 --> 08:57.617
And the family has attempted
to get Mr. Pierce

08:57.668 --> 08:59.034
to accept treatment voluntarily?

08:59.052 --> 09:00.470
Repeatedly, your honor.

09:00.504 --> 09:02.255
Mr. Pierce had burned through
tens of millions of dollars

09:02.289 --> 09:03.639
and racked up enough speeding tickets

09:03.674 --> 09:05.608
- to have his license suspended.
- Well, that does explain

09:05.742 --> 09:08.461
why he's taken to driving
his motorcycle in the house.

09:08.495 --> 09:11.146
He's also building an amusement
park in his backyard.

09:11.181 --> 09:12.681
Apparently, the new girlfriend
loves roller coasters,

09:12.716 --> 09:14.033
but she hates
waiting in line.

09:14.067 --> 09:16.986
Oh, who doesn't? Look,
your evidence is compelling,

09:17.020 --> 09:19.188
but without an independent
psych eval, I can't say

09:19.222 --> 09:22.824
whether Harold Pierce
is crazy or just eccentric.

09:22.859 --> 09:24.810
Get him checked out.
We'll go from there.

09:26.045 --> 09:27.213
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:28.247 --> 09:30.015
(Sighs) That shrink sure is
taking his time.

09:30.049 --> 09:32.334
They let us in with him,
we could've moved this along.

09:33.603 --> 09:36.404
I should've
said this before, but...

09:36.439 --> 09:37.605
(Sighs) Thank you.

09:37.623 --> 09:38.823
For what?

09:38.858 --> 09:40.241
For getting me
to look into David.

09:40.276 --> 09:41.710
You were right.

09:41.744 --> 09:43.545
He wasn't a good guy after all.

09:43.579 --> 09:47.015
(Car door opens and closes)

09:47.049 --> 09:49.034
Is he still in there?
It shouldn't take that long

09:49.068 --> 09:50.619
to prove that he's crazy.

09:52.655 --> 09:55.307
Dad. What the hell
are you doing?

09:55.358 --> 09:57.626
I'm onto you, junior.
Trying to commit me?!

09:57.660 --> 09:59.294
Here. Here's a little present.

09:59.328 --> 10:02.497
Cross me again, come
anywhere near this door,

10:02.515 --> 10:04.332
and I will empty both barrels.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.851
Now take your quack and get.

10:11.607 --> 10:13.358
Well, at least we proved
he's beyond eccentric.

10:19.325 --> 10:22.909
- Statement of support. Do it fast.
- You knew this was happening?

10:22.944 --> 10:24.544
Statement of support.

10:25.179 --> 10:27.013
(Beep)
Is there a stakeout set up?

10:27.047 --> 10:28.731
There's one in the crypt.
Why?

10:28.765 --> 10:30.583
Senator Davis,
what's your response

10:30.617 --> 10:31.684
to the majority leader
stepping down?

10:31.718 --> 10:33.019
Should senator Schumann
resign his seat?

10:33.070 --> 10:34.837
- I would.
- So he <i>should</i> resign?

10:34.872 --> 10:36.038
- Or should there be a...
- There's a hundred of us.

10:36.073 --> 10:38.624
100 senators representing
314 million citizens

10:38.659 --> 10:40.576
of the greatest Republic
ever formed.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.061
I don't think it's too much
to ask that a hundred of us

10:42.095 --> 10:43.696
don't take advantage
of the young people

10:43.747 --> 10:45.998
who come here to learn
how we make laws.

10:46.049 --> 10:47.733
Young people looking
to serve their country

10:47.768 --> 10:49.385
and doing it for free.

10:49.419 --> 10:50.986
I don't mean to make an example
of senator Schumann,

10:51.004 --> 10:52.588
but I do think
that he should resign,

10:52.622 --> 10:55.658
not just as our majority leader,
but as a senator as well.

10:55.692 --> 10:57.627
Lawmakers shouldn't be lawbreakers.

10:57.661 --> 10:58.628
Thank you.

10:59.062 --> 11:00.346
(Man) Will you push for censure?

11:00.380 --> 11:02.014
(Woman) Is this a call
for ethics charges?

11:02.065 --> 11:03.499
We're trying to help you, Harold.

11:03.533 --> 11:04.667
We just want you
to hear us out.

11:04.701 --> 11:06.435
Why should I?
You wouldn't hear me out

11:06.469 --> 11:07.903
when I handed you
a pile of money

11:07.937 --> 11:10.238
and told you to leave Jenna
and me the hell alone.

11:10.273 --> 11:12.040
Dad, this I.P.O. is just
a couple days away.

11:12.074 --> 11:14.326
And I'm gonna tweet it
right into the crapper.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.527
I've got a manifesto.

11:15.561 --> 11:17.462
You only get 140 characters, baby.

11:17.897 --> 11:19.881
Well, then buy me
more characters.

11:19.915 --> 11:22.066
And start a Facebook group

11:22.100 --> 11:24.785
called "down with the Pierce I.P.O."

11:24.820 --> 11:27.271
- Bubble wrap him?
- Bubble wrap him.

11:27.306 --> 11:28.773
(Typing) I can block
satellite stuff from here,

11:28.807 --> 11:30.374
but you're gonna have
to cut his hard line.

11:32.811 --> 11:34.044
Okay,
now cut the blue wire.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.247
No. Wait.
The green wire.

11:37.282 --> 11:39.266
Huck, don't pull this
"Hurt Locker" crap on me.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.151
What happens
if he cuts the wrong one?

11:41.202 --> 11:42.586
Nothing. As long
as it's not the blue wire.

11:44.072 --> 11:45.956
(Harold Sr.) Damn it!

11:45.990 --> 11:47.674
(Harrison) Phone and Internet
are shut down. (Sighs)

11:48.209 --> 11:49.742
Now what happens?

11:49.860 --> 11:52.078
Now it's plan "B"... making sure
he doesn't leave the house.

11:52.096 --> 11:54.014
If we can keep him here
through the I.P.O., great.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.899
And if leaves, our friends
in the silver van

11:55.933 --> 11:57.100
are here to transfer him

11:57.134 --> 11:58.818
to a hospital for
psychiatric evaluation.

11:58.836 --> 12:01.371
My colleague and I are here
to babysit. You two can go home.

12:01.405 --> 12:02.522
Thank you.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.359
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

12:07.393 --> 12:09.678
I'm not being rude, James.
I'm being considerate.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.263
By disinviting me
to a private dinner

12:11.297 --> 12:12.614
with the president
of the United States.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.949
By giving you an out
if you want one.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.367
(Whispers)
To a private dinner

12:15.401 --> 12:16.785
with the president
of the United States.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.370
(Normal voice) Look, you
already gave me the speech

12:18.405 --> 12:19.872
about making sure
my journalistic pursuits

12:19.906 --> 12:21.123
don't end your career.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.408
Did I not promise
to behave myself?

12:22.442 --> 12:23.759
(Cell phone rings)
You did.

12:23.893 --> 12:25.427
(Ring)
Who is it?

12:25.461 --> 12:26.678
My father.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.831
Ah. Then allow me to remove
my gayness from his hatred.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.754
- Yes, David? - Get a chance to
look at the stuff I gave you?

12:36.789 --> 12:38.039
- I did.
- And?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.390
- I'm not convinced.
- Did you see the list

12:39.425 --> 12:40.943
of counties using the
Cytron voting machines?

12:40.977 --> 12:43.444
I did, and I checked the exit polls.
The results match.

12:43.495 --> 12:45.313
Hollis didn't need
to fix anything.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.381
- The pipeline was popular.
- He made secret calls to Cytron

12:47.432 --> 12:49.000
in the weeks leading up
to the explosion.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.669
Look, I'm not saying
there isn't a story here,

12:50.703 --> 12:52.621
but fixing state ballot
measures... that isn't it.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.038
I'm sorry.
(Beep)

12:54.039 --> 12:55.957
(Sighs)

12:56.092 --> 12:58.076
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

13:02.413 --> 13:04.414
(Door opens)

13:04.449 --> 13:06.433
That little speech of yours
is getting a lot of play.

13:06.484 --> 13:08.118
(Door closes)
Cable, prime time.

13:08.152 --> 13:09.720
You said to make myself seen.
I didn't think you'd do it

13:09.754 --> 13:11.104
while standing on the
neck of my client,

13:11.139 --> 13:13.624
which I actually think was
a brilliant political move.

13:13.658 --> 13:15.192
Honesty isn't a strategy, Olivia.

13:15.226 --> 13:17.544
Saying "honesty isn't
a strategy" is a strategy.

13:17.595 --> 13:18.929
This is who I am.

13:18.963 --> 13:21.281
I know, and it's refreshing
and bracing

13:21.315 --> 13:23.467
and very Jimmy Stewart.

13:25.036 --> 13:27.604
If we do this right,

13:27.622 --> 13:30.407
I can make a play
for the senate majority leader.

13:30.441 --> 13:32.109
Yes, you can.

13:33.661 --> 13:35.846
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

13:36.480 --> 13:38.947
(Knocks on door)
Hey. So I was looking online,

13:38.965 --> 13:40.266
and I saw there's
drugs out there

13:40.317 --> 13:41.634
you can shoot people up with,

13:41.668 --> 13:43.519
and it makes them pass out
for, like, ten hours at a time.

13:43.553 --> 13:45.437
- That's real, right?
- Why are you asking me?

13:45.472 --> 13:47.289
Because you're a spy.
And I thought,

13:47.307 --> 13:49.208
if Harold Pierce proved to be
a problem I.P.O.-wise,

13:49.242 --> 13:51.410
we could just inject him with
drugs and stick him in a closet.

13:51.444 --> 13:52.562
Olivia's not gonna do that.

13:52.579 --> 13:53.879
Where do you get them...
Drugs like that?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.531
- (Mouth full) I wouldn't know.
- What's the best one?

13:56.065 --> 13:58.116
We're not gonna use drugs
on him, so what does it matter?

14:00.086 --> 14:02.954
Etorphine.

14:02.989 --> 14:05.057
They call it M99.

14:05.091 --> 14:06.391
Ooh. M99?

14:06.426 --> 14:08.710
God, that even <i>sounds</i> like
a spy name. Thanks, huck.

14:12.031 --> 14:15.183
(Crickets chirping)

14:19.354 --> 14:21.455
<i>Abby, it's David.</i>

14:21.489 --> 14:22.406
(Sighs)

14:22.441 --> 14:23.824
(Scoffs)

14:25.177 --> 14:26.494
What?
(Door opens)

14:26.528 --> 14:28.846
Nothing.

14:29.181 --> 14:30.514
Are those margaritas?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.350
(Scoffs)

14:36.137 --> 14:37.338
Just 'cause you're intruders
doesn't mean you're not guests.

14:37.372 --> 14:38.856
Thanks, but we're on the job.

14:38.907 --> 14:41.275
You don't have to be.
I'll keep an eye on H.P.

14:41.309 --> 14:42.443
Y'all can go.

14:42.477 --> 14:44.044
They're hired guns, baby.

14:44.079 --> 14:47.164
They're not gonna leave
till Skip calls 'em off.

14:47.199 --> 14:49.800
God, you look beautiful
just standing there.

14:50.635 --> 14:52.319
(Laughs) I wore my hair
the way you like it.

14:52.353 --> 14:53.403
Yeah, I noticed.

14:53.437 --> 14:55.021
(Giggles)
(Chuckles) Mmm.

14:55.056 --> 14:56.439
(Jenna moans)

14:56.490 --> 14:58.091
(Laughs)

14:58.125 --> 15:01.878
If you'll excuse us, uh,
I think we're gonna turn in.

15:01.912 --> 15:02.996
Night.

15:04.115 --> 15:05.465
I bet they've got everything

15:05.483 --> 15:07.000
anyone could ever want
in that house.

15:07.034 --> 15:09.052
They could hole up in there
for a month if they had to.

15:09.103 --> 15:11.504
(Scoffs) Looks like
we're spending the night.

15:14.307 --> 15:16.592
(Laughter)

15:16.626 --> 15:18.093
Secret to politics.

15:18.128 --> 15:19.228
Oh, do tell.

15:19.262 --> 15:20.596
The secret to politics is

15:20.630 --> 15:21.881
never listen to pollsters.

15:21.915 --> 15:24.400
- We were down in Ohio...
- Oh, honey,

15:24.451 --> 15:26.769
I think Cyrus and Verna have
already heard this one.

15:26.803 --> 15:28.270
I've never heard it.
James has never heard it.

15:28.321 --> 15:30.840
And it's a classic.
All right.

15:30.891 --> 15:32.191
So there we were
on election night,

15:32.225 --> 15:33.659
tight race from the
second we declared.

15:33.693 --> 15:36.078
- You don't have to remind me.
- And we were down in Ohio...

15:36.129 --> 15:37.429
Neck and neck
but slightly down.

15:37.463 --> 15:39.398
And the returns are coming
in county by county,

15:39.432 --> 15:41.016
and we're sitting
in Santa Barbara,

15:41.050 --> 15:42.584
getting the exit polls
state by state,

15:42.635 --> 15:44.736
- all day long. You remember that?
- I'll never forget.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.161
- Longest day of my life.
- And the red states are red,

15:47.195 --> 15:49.180
and the blue states are blue,
and it all starts to come down

15:49.214 --> 15:51.816
to three counties in Ohio.
I mean, three little counties.

15:52.350 --> 15:53.817
And the exit polls are
saying we lost it.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.569
I mean, I got these numbers guys

15:55.620 --> 15:57.654
whispering in little sewing circles

15:57.672 --> 15:59.289
all over the place...
(Woman chuckles)

15:59.324 --> 16:00.791
wondering and how they're gonna
tell me and who's gonna do it.

16:00.809 --> 16:02.276
And, of course,
he already knows.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.461
- Because my chief of staff is actually
worth a damn. - Thank you.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.029
You're welcome.
(Pats shoulder)

16:06.064 --> 16:07.097
And the last tally
that comes in...

16:07.131 --> 16:08.949
I mean,
it was the very last tally...

16:09.283 --> 16:11.768
Is from a place
called Defiance.

16:11.802 --> 16:14.004
Defiance county, Ohio.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.055
I mean, can you believe that name?

16:16.090 --> 16:19.058
And in Defiance,
of all the exit polls,

16:19.093 --> 16:22.045
we took that county and went
on to win the election.

16:22.879 --> 16:24.713
- Mm.
- And that is why

16:24.747 --> 16:26.582
you should never ever listen
to pollsters...

16:26.617 --> 16:27.733
(Laughs)

16:27.768 --> 16:28.818
Because here we are.

16:28.853 --> 16:30.787
(Verna) Happy Birthday, Mr. President.
(Cyrus) Happy Birthday!

16:30.821 --> 16:31.854
(Woman) Oh, Happy Birthday!
(Fitz) Thanks, everybody.

16:31.873 --> 16:33.022
(Cyrus) Yeah.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.474
So glad you all could come.
(Women) Cheers.

16:34.508 --> 16:36.042
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:59.783 --> 17:01.384
What are you doing
down here?

17:01.418 --> 17:02.635
Car's waiting outside.

17:02.669 --> 17:03.970
Sorry.
I thought I...

17:04.003 --> 17:06.789
I thought I forgot something
in here, but I didn't.

17:06.807 --> 17:08.007
Let's go home.
(Opens drawer)

17:08.058 --> 17:09.308
You know, I thought that
was lamb a little heavy.

17:09.393 --> 17:10.726
Could've used something.

17:10.761 --> 17:12.895
Lemon, maybe, or cumin.

17:12.930 --> 17:15.531
Mm, lamb's always good
with cumin.

17:18.993 --> 17:20.795
<i>(David) I miss you a lot.</i>

17:20.829 --> 17:22.396
<i>And I know I keep saying this,</i>

17:22.431 --> 17:25.550
<i>but that whole Teresa Dunn</i>
<i>thing... it's a complete lie,</i>

17:25.584 --> 17:27.635
<i>and I'm gonna prove it to you.</i>

17:27.670 --> 17:28.720
(Beep)

17:28.754 --> 17:30.588
(Sighs)

17:35.244 --> 17:36.678
(Door opens)

17:38.447 --> 17:40.481
Wake up.
We got company.

17:40.516 --> 17:41.932
(Whirring)

17:42.551 --> 17:44.068
Our phones don't work!

17:44.102 --> 17:46.420
You guys have phones, right?
Call this doctor.

17:46.454 --> 17:50.074
H.P. is real sick.
He's got a fever and everything.

17:51.593 --> 17:53.427
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

17:53.478 --> 17:56.463
55 Democratic senators. All you
need is a simple majority.

17:57.398 --> 17:59.182
- You talk to Garcia?
- I talked to Garcia.

17:59.216 --> 18:00.667
Yes, but did you <i>talk</i>
to Garcia?

18:00.701 --> 18:02.335
Gave him the whole routine.
I sang for Garcia.

18:02.369 --> 18:03.703
I danced for Garcia.

18:03.754 --> 18:05.555
I moonwalked for Garcia.

18:05.589 --> 18:07.557
(Laughs) Mm, no wonder
he's sticking with Holly.

18:07.591 --> 18:09.592
We'll see how well you do at
the president's birthday gala.

18:09.627 --> 18:10.894
That's not gonna happen.

18:11.128 --> 18:13.012
It's bad business.

18:13.063 --> 18:14.964
The outgoing majority
leader is still my client.

18:14.999 --> 18:16.349
How many of your clients are
associates of mine? How long are

18:16.383 --> 18:18.034
we gonna hide in the shadows
and worry about this?

18:18.068 --> 18:19.835
You and me in public
will bring up questions.

18:19.853 --> 18:21.754
- Questions you're not ready to answer.
- Questions that will

18:21.788 --> 18:22.689
distract from your bid,
which isn't a good idea

18:22.723 --> 18:24.857
when you're down
by seven votes.

18:28.244 --> 18:30.696
I hear we have a senate majority
leader position to fill.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.581
That's the other party, Hollis.

18:32.615 --> 18:33.665
It's not our decision.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.050
Now why would you want to leave it

18:35.084 --> 18:36.819
to the folks looking
to squat in your stew?

18:36.853 --> 18:38.253
More pecos poetry.

18:38.271 --> 18:40.122
Senator Hawley of the
great state of Missouri

18:40.156 --> 18:41.556
is a man I can work with.

18:41.574 --> 18:43.358
I don't want to know
what you've got on him.

18:43.376 --> 18:45.077
Suits me 'cause I'm
not about to share it.

18:45.111 --> 18:46.228
We either get him

18:46.262 --> 18:47.462
or "senator integrity,"
Edison Davis.

18:47.497 --> 18:48.597
You wanna spend
the rest of your term

18:48.631 --> 18:49.765
trying to get him to play ball?

18:49.799 --> 18:51.350
There's a limit to our influence.

18:51.384 --> 18:52.484
Exceed it.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.037
I'm getting tired of reminding.

18:56.071 --> 18:57.338
You owe me.

18:57.372 --> 19:00.208
Funny. I'd say you never
seem to tire of it.

19:00.242 --> 19:02.193
We have the same interests, Cy.

19:02.244 --> 19:04.979
Always have, always will.

19:10.135 --> 19:12.469
Dr. Walters,
as I said on the phone,

19:12.504 --> 19:14.471
you are bound by
doctor-patient confidentiality,

19:14.522 --> 19:15.889
and I don't care if "The
Wall Street Journal" calls

19:15.923 --> 19:16.907
and offers you
a million bucks.

19:17.059 --> 19:18.909
You cannot breathe a word
about Harold Pierce. Got it?

19:18.943 --> 19:20.411
Mm.
Got it.

19:22.547 --> 19:24.081
If you let me in, I can help.

19:24.132 --> 19:25.199
Oh, no.
You don't want to.

19:25.233 --> 19:26.867
It's some kind of real
bad flu or something.

19:30.355 --> 19:31.872
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

19:32.807 --> 19:34.591
Insuring the integrity
of national elections.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.076
That's what the article's about, yeah.

19:36.110 --> 19:37.644
And you would like us to...

19:37.662 --> 19:39.663
Explain to me in layman's terms
how election rigging works.

19:39.697 --> 19:41.998
You said in your dissertation
that electronic voting machines

19:42.033 --> 19:44.601
are "highly susceptible
to tampering."

19:44.635 --> 19:46.319
So if I had to prove
that the voting machines

19:46.354 --> 19:47.654
in a particular county
had been tampered with,

19:47.672 --> 19:49.239
in the Grant/Reston
election, for example,

19:49.273 --> 19:50.957
- how would I do that?
- Do you know where the machines are?

19:50.991 --> 19:53.243
- Let's say I don't.
- Then your first step is finding them.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.195
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

19:55.629 --> 19:57.764
- "The times," huh?
- Mm-hmm.

19:57.798 --> 20:01.117
And what is this newspaper
story about, again?

20:01.168 --> 20:03.536
Defiance county's successful
transition into the digital age.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.755
Uh, how many voting machines
are assigned to Defiance?

20:05.806 --> 20:07.540
150, state of the art, digital.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.925
You know, we were the first...

20:08.976 --> 20:10.209
And... and the same machines

20:10.244 --> 20:11.294
that were used in the last
election are kept here?

20:11.328 --> 20:13.179
In a warehouse near the ball fields.

20:13.197 --> 20:15.248
It's interesting. Did you know
we're the first...

20:15.282 --> 20:17.050
Can you give me a list of those
machines by serial number?

20:19.369 --> 20:21.570
- In a hurry, are we?
- Yes, sir.

20:21.604 --> 20:24.740
- Let me fish it out for you.
- Thank you.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.164
Thanks.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.132
You're welcome.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.840
(Machine beeps)
And once I find the machines?

20:42.858 --> 20:44.025
Then it's all about
the memory card.

20:44.059 --> 20:45.793
That's where
the software lives.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.278
And if you know
how to program one,

20:47.312 --> 20:48.662
you can pretty much make
it do whatever you want.

20:48.714 --> 20:49.880
Like reassign votes.

20:50.414 --> 20:51.398
Say you vote for Reston/Howard.

20:51.432 --> 20:52.933
The individual receipt
would look find.

20:52.967 --> 20:54.635
<i>You'd never know your votes</i>
<i>were stolen.</i>

20:54.669 --> 20:56.153
But the final tally... the one
the voter never gets to see...

20:56.187 --> 20:57.688
<i>That would show you</i>
<i>what actually gets sent</i>

20:57.722 --> 20:58.590
<i>to the board of elections.</i>

20:58.607 --> 21:00.007
<i>So find a machine</i>
<i>that skews the results.</i>

21:00.008 --> 21:01.392
<i>And get your hands</i>
<i>on the memory card.</i> (Beeps)

21:01.426 --> 21:02.560
<i>That's your smoking gun.</i>

21:07.197 --> 21:08.448
Where's the memory card?

21:20.544 --> 21:22.228
Are the cards missing
from all of these?

21:22.280 --> 21:23.363
I don't know.

21:31.954 --> 21:33.422
Okay, we've drugged
Harold Pierce,

21:33.456 --> 21:35.590
- and he's out cold for ten hours.
- We didn't drug him.

21:35.608 --> 21:36.976
I know, but let's say we did.

21:37.027 --> 21:38.277
Let's say he's knocked out
in his bedroom closet,

21:38.328 --> 21:39.964
but the police have heard about
it, and they're on the way over.

21:39.997 --> 21:41.797
The police heard he was
lying in a bedroom closet?

21:41.898 --> 21:44.149
The maid called.
The question is how do we get him

21:44.184 --> 21:45.267
from the closet of his
house in Virginia

21:45.301 --> 21:47.036
to his estate in Martha's vineyard?

21:47.070 --> 21:48.620
You can't drive him.
That's not quick.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.039
And we can't take him to the airport

21:50.073 --> 21:51.340
because there's no way
security lets you through

21:51.374 --> 21:54.426
carrying an old guy
over your shoulder, right?

21:54.461 --> 21:55.444
Right, Huck?

21:55.478 --> 21:56.945
- Hypothetically?
- Of course.

21:57.579 --> 21:59.014
Hypotheticals are pointless.

21:59.048 --> 22:02.033
Is there a real-world situation
you'd like to ask me about?

22:02.068 --> 22:03.501
No.

22:03.536 --> 22:04.886
Okay.

22:04.921 --> 22:06.371
Come back when there is.

22:06.405 --> 22:08.740
(Types)

22:11.994 --> 22:14.179
You need to come in here,
both of you.

22:14.230 --> 22:16.097
Harold has something
he needs to say.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.500
Mr. Pierce?

22:18.534 --> 22:20.752
You all right?

22:21.187 --> 22:22.654
I'm more than all right.

22:22.688 --> 22:24.022
I'm married.

22:24.056 --> 22:25.490
You married them?

22:25.541 --> 22:27.659
- I'm a doctor of theology.
- You're a minister?

22:27.693 --> 22:29.360
Meet my beautiful bride,

22:30.195 --> 22:31.695
Jenna Newhall Pierce,

22:31.730 --> 22:33.080
the pride of Bakersfield

22:33.114 --> 22:35.599
and the only person legally
authorized to commit me.

22:35.634 --> 22:37.301
So pack up your men
in white and beat it

22:37.352 --> 22:39.937
so we can kick off our
honeymoon in private.

22:39.971 --> 22:41.972
I love you, H.P.

22:42.023 --> 22:43.607
I love you, too, sweetheart.

22:43.642 --> 22:44.642
(Pop)

22:53.063 --> 22:55.231
You let them get married?

22:55.265 --> 22:56.900
Liv, I didn't know.
I'm sorry. I just...

22:56.934 --> 22:58.451
You want more responsibility
around here,

22:58.486 --> 22:59.719
you need to earn it.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.555
I <i>did</i> earn it...
The hard way.

23:04.108 --> 23:06.810
I'll talk to the family.
They're already in my office.

23:06.844 --> 23:07.777
(Beep)

23:07.812 --> 23:10.480
So this... this girl

23:10.514 --> 23:12.165
who's ten years younger
than me...

23:12.216 --> 23:14.283
She gets to make the decisions
when he's incapacitated?

23:14.301 --> 23:16.269
She's the one holding the reins?

23:18.339 --> 23:19.906
Anne?

23:20.740 --> 23:22.891
He's... sick.

23:22.926 --> 23:24.343
(Scoffs)

23:24.394 --> 23:27.046
It's not that I want him back.
That's not what I want.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.715
But when I think about Harold,
the man I fell in love with,

23:29.749 --> 23:33.886
the man I married, I realize
I-I owe him my whole life,

23:33.920 --> 23:36.422
and if he's sick,
if he's hurting,

23:36.456 --> 23:39.625
I can't just turn my back on him.

23:41.594 --> 23:44.496
(Grunts)

23:44.531 --> 23:46.665
All right.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.033
Nope.

23:50.970 --> 23:52.371
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

23:53.405 --> 23:56.040
I don't believe this.
There's one missing.

23:56.075 --> 23:57.742
Hey, Dennis?

23:57.776 --> 24:00.178
Hey, Dennis?
One's missing.

24:00.212 --> 24:02.080
You wanted voting machines.
These are the voting machines.

24:02.814 --> 24:04.481
Right, but one's missing
from the list.

24:04.516 --> 24:05.883
I've crossed off every
name but this one.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.151
Are you sure these are
the only machines?

24:07.185 --> 24:09.186
Yes.
There's not one in a back room

24:09.220 --> 24:11.155
- or one of your offices or something?
- Nothing.

24:11.189 --> 24:13.023
One of the machines
is missing, Dennis.

24:13.058 --> 24:14.625
There's 150 on the list

24:14.659 --> 24:16.160
and only 149
here in the warehouse.

24:16.194 --> 24:17.661
Do you know
what this could mean?

24:17.695 --> 24:20.097
I make $9.30 an hour.

24:20.131 --> 24:24.133
I have four kids, two in college.
I do not care.

24:24.168 --> 24:26.002
Dennis, I am begging you.

24:26.036 --> 24:27.904
This is every machine we have.

24:29.273 --> 24:31.641
Except for the one
at the high school.

24:31.675 --> 24:32.876
The high school?

24:32.910 --> 24:34.110
Yeah. They keep one
in a display case there.

24:34.145 --> 24:36.479
Supposed to be a commemoration
or something,

24:36.514 --> 24:37.847
like a little museum.

24:37.882 --> 24:40.316
(Sighs)

24:41.651 --> 24:42.551
(Door rattles)

24:50.760 --> 24:52.060
Hey.

24:53.162 --> 24:54.863
Hey! Hey!

Hey, honey.

25:01.604 --> 25:03.672
I'm standing in your cubicle.
Where are you?

25:03.706 --> 25:05.040
Ah, my dad's having
one of those days

25:05.074 --> 25:06.441
where he thinks
I'm his Uncle Krystof.

25:06.475 --> 25:08.677
I'm sorry to hear that.
Anything I can do?

25:08.711 --> 25:10.178
No. If it's okay
with you, though,

25:10.213 --> 25:12.746
- I think I'll spend the night here.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

25:12.781 --> 25:13.881
Yeah.
Whatever you need.

25:13.916 --> 25:14.516
Thanks.

25:24.158 --> 25:27.628
Yes, uh, that's right. I'm looking
for flight plans from two years ago.

25:27.662 --> 25:29.830
Anything out of Sonoma County airport.

25:29.864 --> 25:32.933
And, hey, does Judy Soltys
still work at the tarmac?

25:32.967 --> 25:34.635
(Chuckles)
Of course I know her.

25:34.669 --> 25:37.037
She was the beer pong
queen of Petaluma High.

25:37.071 --> 25:40.474
No, take your time, Sandy.
It is Sandy, right?

25:40.508 --> 25:42.142
No problem.
I'll hold.

25:47.232 --> 25:49.583
(Projector and camera

25:49.617 --> 25:50.902
So?

25:52.020 --> 25:53.487
So?

25:54.021 --> 25:57.040
Majority leader. Race is tied.
Going down to the wire.

25:57.274 --> 25:59.108
He hasn't decided
who he's backing yet.

26:00.511 --> 26:02.111
You're here to lobby me,

26:02.146 --> 26:04.264
on behalf of your boyfriend.
Adorable.

26:04.298 --> 26:06.348
Just trying to figure out where
the smart money is headed.

26:06.383 --> 26:07.950
If I were a betting man, and I am,

26:07.968 --> 26:10.686
I'd say he backs Edison,
cozies up real nice to him

26:10.720 --> 26:12.287
to get his republican
stink all over him.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.323
Sure, fire way to tank
Edison's nomination...

26:14.357 --> 26:16.475
Calling him a man he looks
forward to working with.

26:16.509 --> 26:18.377
The party will turn
on him immediately.

26:18.411 --> 26:22.998
I'll happily double down
on that bet, but I hope I lose.

26:23.016 --> 26:25.517
My heart's set on him backing
hawley so Edison wins.

26:25.552 --> 26:27.519
You want Edison to win?
Why?

26:27.570 --> 26:28.754
Because that means
he's over you,

26:28.788 --> 26:30.772
which means I get
my president back.

26:33.575 --> 26:34.759
Hey, you asked.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.279
How about you?
What are you hoping for?

26:44.686 --> 26:45.670

I'm sorry.

Skip, I don't think
Harold's crazy.

32:21.804 --> 32:22.971
Well, you obviously
haven't seen plans

32:22.989 --> 32:24.306
for the 90-foot tilt-a-whirl
he wants to build

32:24.340 --> 32:26.158
- near the driveway.
- Skip.

32:26.192 --> 32:27.960
But you are being a <i>huge</i>
pain in the ass about the I.P.O.,

32:27.961 --> 32:28.612
and I want to know why.

32:28.729 --> 32:31.829
For the last 50 years, I've done
everything I was supposed to do.

32:31.830 --> 32:34.515
I kept multiple roofs
over my family's head,

32:34.550 --> 32:37.952
I took them on nice trips,
I sent my kids to great schools,

32:37.986 --> 32:39.403
I never cheated, I was dutiful,

32:39.438 --> 32:41.689
I never complained or asked
for anything in return.

32:41.723 --> 32:43.074
Well, sorry to hear that
spending so much time

32:43.108 --> 32:45.226
- with your family was so painful.
- Skip.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.795
I'm finally having some fun.

32:48.829 --> 32:51.314
I know that I'm old enough to
be Jenna's great-grandfather

32:51.349 --> 32:54.051
and she'd leave me the minute
she lost her clothing allowance,

32:54.085 --> 32:55.502
but I'm having fun.

32:55.536 --> 32:57.704
And it's not like I'm spending
my ex-wife's money

32:57.739 --> 32:59.373
or your money
or even your kids' money.

32:59.407 --> 33:00.741
I'm spending <i>my</i> money.

33:00.775 --> 33:02.442
So why try to take the I.P.O.?
Why not just walk away?

33:02.477 --> 33:04.294
Because he doesn't think
that I can run the company.

33:04.345 --> 33:05.679
He'd rather light the match himself

33:05.713 --> 33:07.264
and watch the whole
thing go down in flames

33:07.298 --> 33:09.499
- rather than hand over the reins
to me. - Oh, Skip, for God sake,

33:09.534 --> 33:11.551
I know you can do it.
I just don't want you to.

33:11.569 --> 33:14.086
- You're a megalomaniac.
- No, because I love you, you idiot.

33:14.104 --> 33:15.072
I don't want you
to end up like me.

33:15.806 --> 33:17.690
I don't want you to spend
your life... to <i>waste</i> your life...

33:17.724 --> 33:19.976
Building a pile of money,
because it's not worth it.

33:20.010 --> 33:21.561
Believe me.

33:22.063 --> 33:25.633
You spent your whole life
building Pierce Industries.

33:27.167 --> 33:28.667
I spent my whole life
working there.

33:28.685 --> 33:30.719
I've been in every department
from top to bottom.

33:30.754 --> 33:32.838
I know everyone
and exactly what they do.

33:32.872 --> 33:34.290
Going to work is
what gets me excited

33:34.324 --> 33:36.075
to wake up in the morning.
You want to ride your bike

33:36.109 --> 33:38.727
in the house because it makes
you happy? Go for it.

33:38.762 --> 33:40.646
But what makes me happy, dad...

33:40.664 --> 33:42.515
Working at my family's company,

33:42.549 --> 33:44.483
making it the best it can be.

33:45.117 --> 33:46.885
By holding it over
to complete strangers?

33:46.903 --> 33:50.522
I was pushing the I.P.O. 'cause
I thought that's what he wanted,

33:50.556 --> 33:54.559
the culmination to a
great business career.

33:56.179 --> 33:58.513
Hmm.

33:58.548 --> 34:00.332
So, Harold, you're trying
to make Skip happy

34:00.366 --> 34:01.833
by sabotaging the business.

34:01.868 --> 34:04.419
Skip, you're trying to save your
dad's legacy by pushing him out.

34:04.470 --> 34:05.637
Yeah.

34:05.671 --> 34:06.822
Sounds about right.

34:06.856 --> 34:08.572
That's messed up, but I get it.

34:08.607 --> 34:11.393
And I think
there's a way out of this.

34:11.444 --> 34:14.478
And it may even keep you two

<i>But the final tally, the one</i>
<i>the voter never gets to see...</i>

35:02.777 --> 35:04.110
<i>That would show you</i>
<i>what actually gets sent</i>

35:04.161 --> 35:05.361
<i>to the board of elections.</i>

35:05.379 --> 35:06.297

35:23.114 --> 35:24.180
(Click)

35:36.593 --> 35:39.512
And so after protracted
discussions with family members

35:39.546 --> 35:42.114
and weighing the pros and
cons of our stock offering,

35:42.132 --> 35:44.767
we've decided to cancel
the I.P.O.

35:44.802 --> 35:46.702
The company will remain in the family.

35:46.737 --> 35:48.704
<i>Also effective immediately,</i>
<i>I will be stepping down</i>

35:49.957 --> 35:51.491
<i>after 42 years</i>

35:51.525 --> 35:54.093
<i>and handing the reins over</i>
<i>to my son Skip.</i>

35:54.128 --> 35:57.764
I thought this would be
some kind of temporary thing

35:57.798 --> 36:01.717
we'd get through, but,
uh, it isn't, is it?

36:01.752 --> 36:04.303
He's never coming back to me.

36:05.606 --> 36:07.507
You still had hope that...

36:07.541 --> 36:10.309
<i>And I have the utmost faith</i>
<i>in him.</i>

36:10.344 --> 36:13.880
You need to do what he did.

36:13.914 --> 36:17.066
Find a way to be happy.

36:18.617 --> 36:19.684
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

36:19.718 --> 36:21.002
Then there's the majority
leader situation.

36:21.037 --> 36:22.820
- Where do things stand?
- You're not gonna like it.

36:22.838 --> 36:25.574
- So what else is new?
- The choice is between senator Hawley

36:25.625 --> 36:28.159
Who Hollis Doyle is
pushing for <i>hard...</i>

36:28.194 --> 36:29.477
And Edison Davis,

36:29.512 --> 36:33.064
who... well, we know how you feel
about Edison Davis.

36:39.154 --> 36:41.205
Put out a statement

36:41.239 --> 36:44.024
saying we'd look forward
to working with Hawley.

36:44.058 --> 36:47.528
Which means Edison will be
the new majority leader.

36:52.417 --> 36:53.550
What?

36:53.568 --> 36:55.486
I'm just surprised.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.603
Pleasantly.

36:59.207 --> 37:01.358
But I lost a bet on this one.

37:01.392 --> 37:04.194
(Door opens)

37:04.229 --> 37:05.662
(Door closes)

37:07.565 --> 37:10.284
Uh-huh.
Yes.

37:10.318 --> 37:11.985
Yeah.
Yes.

37:12.020 --> 37:14.104
Thank you.

37:14.138 --> 37:16.473
The White House just threw
their support behind Hawley,

37:16.491 --> 37:18.959
sent half their caucus
running over to our side.

37:18.993 --> 37:20.961
It's all over.

37:22.430 --> 37:24.298
Wow.

37:25.549 --> 37:27.216
You didn't have a hand in this?

37:27.250 --> 37:28.567
No.
No hand.

37:28.602 --> 37:30.002
Liv.

37:30.053 --> 37:32.638
The White House did this
completely on their own.

37:32.672 --> 37:35.608
Why? If you didn't twist
their arm, then who did?

37:37.811 --> 37:39.461
You okay?

37:39.479 --> 37:40.629
Of course.

37:40.664 --> 37:42.732
Happy for you.

37:42.766 --> 37:44.984
You don't look it.

37:47.737 --> 37:49.755
I'm thrilled.

37:49.806 --> 37:52.274
And I'll be proud
to walk into that gala

37:52.309 --> 37:55.628
on the new senate
majority leader's arm.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.397
You're all in?

38:02.084 --> 38:03.552
There was a guy before you.

38:03.586 --> 38:05.920
I'm not gonna talk about
him, but there was,

38:05.938 --> 38:07.856
and it was serious,

38:07.890 --> 38:10.559
but... we're done.

38:10.593 --> 38:12.144
It's over.

38:12.195 --> 38:14.379
So...

38:14.414 --> 38:16.948
I'm all in.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.283
(Chuckles)

38:18.334 --> 38:19.534
Mm.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.005
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

38:23.939 --> 38:26.691
You screwed me sideways.

38:26.725 --> 38:28.175
(Door closes)
It was what you wanted.

38:28.209 --> 38:29.860
Don't piss on my stetson
and tell me it's rainin'.

38:29.895 --> 38:32.046
Did you not ask us
to get behind Hawley?

38:32.080 --> 38:33.247
In private, back channels.

38:33.281 --> 38:34.398
I don't have to explain this to you.

38:34.433 --> 38:35.816
You know damn well
what you did!

38:35.850 --> 38:37.518
I'm sorry if there was
a misunderstanding.

38:37.552 --> 38:39.754
That's it. I'm all done
asking, reminding.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.139
I'm about ready to bring this
whole house of cards down.

38:42.173 --> 38:43.424
You wouldn't.

38:43.458 --> 38:46.744
You have no idea what I
would or would not do.

38:46.778 --> 38:49.029
No idea at all.

38:51.132 --> 38:53.700
(Door opens)

38:55.018 --> 38:57.403
So I talked to Sandy
at the Sonoma County airport

38:57.421 --> 38:58.621
and she put me in touch

38:58.655 --> 39:00.456
with Chuck, the flight plan guy
at the F.A.A.

39:00.490 --> 39:01.574
Sandy and Chuck went out once.

39:01.608 --> 39:03.092
She thought he was nice but too old.

39:03.126 --> 39:05.261
We handled Harold Pierce.
That's all done.

39:05.295 --> 39:06.979
No, I know.
I'm talking about me now.

39:07.013 --> 39:08.047
I'm talking about the night

39:08.081 --> 39:09.515
I was taken from the
motel two years ago.

39:09.550 --> 39:11.167
See, there was a private
plane that left

39:11.201 --> 39:13.519
the Sonoma County airport
that night and went to D.C.

39:13.554 --> 39:16.255
And here's the thing I just
learned about private planes...

39:16.306 --> 39:18.190
If it's a domestic flight,
you don't have to tell anyone

39:18.225 --> 39:19.859
the names of the passengers onboard.

39:19.893 --> 39:21.494
You just have to say
how many there are.

39:22.428 --> 39:23.829
Chuck from the F.A.A.

39:23.863 --> 39:26.064
told me there were two
passengers on that flight.

39:26.098 --> 39:28.049
I don't know their names,
but you know what I think?

39:28.084 --> 39:30.268
I think one of those
passengers was me,

39:30.303 --> 39:32.804
and I think you or someone
like you was the other one.

39:32.839 --> 39:35.323
I think you or someone like you
injected me with M99

39:35.358 --> 39:36.725
and put me on that plane
and flew me here.

39:36.759 --> 39:39.010
What do <i>you</i> think, Huck?
Does that sound plausible to you?

39:39.045 --> 39:40.562
- Quinn...
- No.

39:40.596 --> 39:42.347
Let me finish.

39:43.616 --> 39:45.600
It sounds plausible to me

39:45.651 --> 39:47.586
because that plane...

39:47.653 --> 39:50.055
The plane that flew from Sonoma
to Washington, D.C.

39:50.089 --> 39:52.107
the night I was taken?

39:52.141 --> 39:55.510
It was registered
to Verna Thornton,

39:55.545 --> 39:57.546
the supreme court justice.

39:59.198 --> 40:01.850
She's one of Olivia's clients, right?

40:04.504 --> 40:07.022
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

40:15.463 --> 40:18.215
I'm a very lucky man.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.880
Did you turn your ringer off?
It's me.

40:33.915 --> 40:36.366
I had to leave early,
but I reserved another car,

40:36.400 --> 40:38.168
so if you get home from
your dad's and you feel like

40:38.202 --> 40:40.220
slipping into something
a little less comfortable

40:40.254 --> 40:43.507
to join me at the gala,
you'll find me at the bar.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.114
(Both laugh)

41:00.675 --> 41:03.343
(Cheering)

41:05.177 --> 41:07.045
What am I pretending
you got me for my birthday?

41:07.096 --> 41:08.413
The press is gonna ask.

41:08.447 --> 41:10.081
Cyrus says to say I gave
you a first edition

41:10.116 --> 41:12.133
of "To Kill a Mockingbird"
signed by Harper Lee.

41:12.167 --> 41:13.985
That's good.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.470
Here we go.

41:15.504 --> 41:16.671
What if we just...

41:16.689 --> 41:20.008
What?

41:20.042 --> 41:21.142
I don't know...

41:21.177 --> 41:23.095
Skip this whole thing
and went home.

41:24.530 --> 41:25.830
Is it the baby?
You feeling okay?

41:25.864 --> 41:27.149
I feel fine.
I just...

41:28.184 --> 41:29.634

security an hour ago,

you're afraid of my mistress?
