00:50.677 --> 00:53.012
(Water splashing)

01:03.064 --> 01:05.108
(Men shouting)

01:49.444 --> 01:51.071
(Creaking)

01:57.827 --> 01:59.871
(Men shouting)

02:04.918 --> 02:06.961
(Man) Usurer!

02:09.506 --> 02:11.424
Usurer!

02:19.933 --> 02:21.976
(Man murmers)

02:30.652 --> 02:34.697
"If a man is righteous,
and does what is lawful and right,

02:34.781 --> 02:38.743
"if he has not exacted usury
nor taken any increase

02:38.827 --> 02:42.080
"but has withdrawn his hand
from all iniquity

02:42.163 --> 02:46.251
"and executed true judgment
between men and men,

02:46.334 --> 02:48.795
"if he has walked in my statutes

02:48.878 --> 02:54.050
"and kept my judgment faithfully,
then he is just and he shall surely live.

02:54.843 --> 02:58.388
"But if he has exacted usury
and taken increase,

02:58.471 --> 03:00.306
"shall he then live?

03:00.390 --> 03:04.686
"No, he shall not live. If he has
done any of these abominations... "

03:04.769 --> 03:08.106
- (Cheering)
- "... he shall surely die, says the Lord. "

03:09.482 --> 03:13.027
(Preacher) And yet you live
by theft and robbery...

03:13.111 --> 03:15.071
Antonio.

03:19.242 --> 03:22.370
(Preacher continues, crowd shouting)

03:47.687 --> 03:50.607
(Both laughing)

04:36.945 --> 04:38.238
Antonio.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.823
Bassanio.

04:49.207 --> 04:52.877
- (Man) Wind's coming back, sir.
- (Sail flapping)

05:05.432 --> 05:07.058
(Man) Signior Lorenzo.

05:23.241 --> 05:25.285
(Dog barking)

05:26.411 --> 05:28.997
(Chanting)

05:31.082 --> 05:33.668
(Chanting continues)

05:54.773 --> 05:56.816
(Doors opening)

06:27.514 --> 06:29.099
Jessica.

06:41.194 --> 06:44.406
(Antonio) In truth,
I know not why I am so sad.

06:45.740 --> 06:49.577
It wearies me. You say it wearies you.

06:51.663 --> 06:56.000
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
that I have much ado than know myself.

06:56.084 --> 06:58.753
Your mind is tossing on the ocean.

06:58.837 --> 07:02.590
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,

07:02.674 --> 07:06.970
the better part of my affection
would be with my hopes abroad.

07:08.304 --> 07:12.183
I should be still plucking the grass
to know where sits the wind,

07:12.267 --> 07:15.478
peering in maps
for ports and piers and roads.

07:15.562 --> 07:19.983
And every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures

07:20.066 --> 07:22.318
out of doubt would make me sad.

07:22.402 --> 07:25.029
My wind, cooling my broth,

07:25.113 --> 07:29.034
would blow me to a fever if I thought what
harm a wind too great might do at sea.

07:29.117 --> 07:32.245
Believe me, no.

07:32.328 --> 07:35.540
- Why, then you're in love.
- (Laughs)

07:36.332 --> 07:38.293
Fie, fie, fie!

07:42.589 --> 07:45.008
Not in love either?

07:45.091 --> 07:47.343
Then let us say you are sad

07:47.427 --> 07:49.846
because you are not merry.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.973
Here comes my lord Bassanio.

07:57.228 --> 08:01.441
- Good morrow, my good lord.
- Good signiors. When shall we laugh?

08:01.524 --> 08:04.986
We shall make our leisures
to fit in with yours.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.740
- Bassanio.
- Signior.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.241
(Whispers)

08:10.325 --> 08:14.120
My lord Bassanio, since you have found
Antonio, we too will leave you.

08:16.414 --> 08:19.209
You look not well, Signior Antonio.

08:21.336 --> 08:24.214
You have too much respect
upon the world.

08:25.090 --> 08:27.717
They lose it that do buy it with much care.

08:27.801 --> 08:31.346
I hold the world but
as the world, Gratiano -

08:31.429 --> 08:37.852
a stage where every man
must play his part, and mine a sad one.

08:44.984 --> 08:47.153
Come, good Lorenzo.

08:47.237 --> 08:50.657
Fare thee well awhile.
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

08:51.616 --> 08:53.576
Fare thee well.

08:54.536 --> 08:57.205
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,

08:57.288 --> 08:59.582
more than any man in all of Venice.

09:04.421 --> 09:05.839
Well?

09:22.439 --> 09:24.274
Tell me now...

09:28.570 --> 09:32.574
that which today
you promised to tell me of.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.789
(Bassanio sighs)

09:39.873 --> 09:45.378
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
how much I have disabled mine estate,

09:45.462 --> 09:49.257
but my chief care is to come
squarely out of the great debts

09:49.340 --> 09:55.346
wherein my youth, something too prodigal,

09:56.222 --> 09:58.558
has left me pledged.

09:58.641 --> 10:04.606
To you, Antonio,
I owe the most in money and in love,

10:04.689 --> 10:09.736
and from your love I have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes

10:09.819 --> 10:13.490
how to get clear of all the debts I owe.

10:14.783 --> 10:17.243
Pray, good Bassanio, let me know it.

10:19.746 --> 10:29.255
And, if it stand, as you yourself still do,
within the eye of honour,

10:29.339 --> 10:34.969
be assured my purse, my person,
my extremest means

10:35.053 --> 10:37.514
lie all unlocked to your occasion.

10:41.101 --> 10:44.187
In Belmont is a lady richly left -

10:44.896 --> 10:50.527
and she is fair, and fairer than that word -

10:51.694 --> 10:54.364
of wondrous virtues.

10:54.447 --> 10:59.244
Sometimes, from her eyes
I did receive fair...

11:00.286 --> 11:02.038
speechless messages.

11:04.332 --> 11:08.920
Her name is Portia, no less a beauty
than Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.

11:09.003 --> 11:12.132
Nor is the wide world
ignorant of her worth,

11:12.215 --> 11:16.428
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors.

11:19.639 --> 11:21.683
O my Antonio,

11:22.559 --> 11:27.689
had I but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them

11:29.816 --> 11:33.570
then I should questionless be fortunate.

11:36.823 --> 11:39.534
Thou knowest my fortunes are at sea.

11:45.707 --> 11:50.754
Neither have I money nor commodity
to raise a present sum.

11:58.678 --> 12:01.139
Therefore, go forth.

12:01.222 --> 12:04.934
Try what my credit can in Venice do.

12:09.189 --> 12:13.985
It shall be racked, even to the uttermost,
to furnish you to Belmont,

12:15.361 --> 12:17.113
and fair Portia.

12:26.998 --> 12:28.833
(Birdsong)

12:34.339 --> 12:37.175
I swear to you, Nerissa,

12:37.258 --> 12:41.346
- I am more weary of this great world.
- You would be, sweet madam,

12:41.429 --> 12:45.892
if your miseries were as plentiful
as your good fortunes are.

12:45.975 --> 12:48.019
And yet, from what I see,

12:48.103 --> 12:52.607
they are as sick that have it in excess
as those that starve with nothing.

12:52.690 --> 12:56.111
If doing were as easy
as knowing what were good to do,

12:56.194 --> 12:58.238
chapels had been churches,

12:58.321 --> 13:01.282
and poor men's cottages princes' palaces.

13:02.701 --> 13:07.455
(Sighs) But this reasoning is
not in the way to choose me a husband.

13:07.539 --> 13:09.916
O me, the word "choose"!

13:09.999 --> 13:13.962
I may neither choose who I would
nor refuse who I dislike.

13:14.045 --> 13:18.174
So is the will of a living daughter
ruled by a dead father.

13:22.679 --> 13:28.268
Is it not hard, Nerissa,
that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

13:30.270 --> 13:33.398
Your father was always virtuous,

13:33.481 --> 13:38.611
and holy men, at their death,
have good inspirations.

13:39.571 --> 13:41.364
Therefore the lottery, that he devised

13:41.448 --> 13:44.659
in these three chests
of gold and silver and lead,

13:44.743 --> 13:47.245
so that who chooses his meaning
chooses you,

13:47.328 --> 13:52.792
will no doubt only be guessed, rightly,
by someone who you shall rightly love.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.253
Right.

13:55.837 --> 13:58.506
(Nerissa) What warmth is there
in your affection

13:58.590 --> 14:01.885
towards any of these princely suitors
that are already come?

14:01.968 --> 14:05.180
(Portia) Pray name them, and
as you name them I will describe them,

14:05.263 --> 14:08.933
and, according
to my description, level at my affection.

14:09.017 --> 14:12.937
How say you of the French lord,
Monsieur Le Bon?

14:13.021 --> 14:15.273
Oh, God.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.693
God made him,
and therefore let him pass for a man.

14:18.777 --> 14:21.404
I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he...!

14:21.488 --> 14:24.741
What say you to Falconbridge,
the young baron of England?

14:24.824 --> 14:28.912
(Portia laughs) How oddly he's suited!

14:28.995 --> 14:31.331
And the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

14:33.333 --> 14:36.795
Very vilely in the morning
when he is sober,

14:36.878 --> 14:39.923
and most vilely in the afternoon
when he is drunk.

14:40.006 --> 14:41.716
O Nerissa!

14:41.800 --> 14:43.718
- (Giggling)
- Wait! Wait.

14:43.802 --> 14:47.597
If he should offer to choose,
and choose the right casket,

14:47.680 --> 14:53.311
you should refuse to perform your father's
will if you should refuse to accept him.

14:53.395 --> 14:56.314
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee,

14:56.398 --> 15:00.110
set a deep glass of Rhenish wine
on the contrary casket.

15:00.193 --> 15:05.073
I will do anything, Nerissa,
ere I will be married to a sponge.

15:05.532 --> 15:07.367
(Bell tolling)

15:14.874 --> 15:17.168
(Bleating)

15:18.670 --> 15:21.965
(Shylock) Three thousand ducats.

15:22.048 --> 15:23.675
Well.

15:23.758 --> 15:26.302
Ay, sir, for three months.

15:26.386 --> 15:28.888
For three months?

15:31.558 --> 15:33.893
- Well...
- For which, as I told you,

15:33.977 --> 15:35.937
Antonio shall be bound.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.064
Antonio shall be bound?

15:41.317 --> 15:43.528
Well...

15:43.611 --> 15:46.156
May you help me? Will you pleasure me?

15:47.615 --> 15:49.659
Should I know your answer?

15:51.036 --> 15:54.539
Three thousand ducats for three months,

15:54.622 --> 15:56.958
and Antonio bound.

15:57.042 --> 15:59.085
Your answer to that.

15:59.919 --> 16:01.963
Antonio is a good man.

16:02.839 --> 16:05.884
Have you heard any imputation
to the contrary?

16:05.967 --> 16:10.305
No. No, no, no, no. My meaning
in saying that he is a good man

16:10.388 --> 16:15.560
is to have you understand
that he is of good credit.

16:15.643 --> 16:17.687
Yet his means are in question.

16:19.105 --> 16:23.735
He hath a ship bound for Tripolis,
another to the Indies.

16:23.818 --> 16:28.365
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto,
he hath a third ship at Mexico,

16:28.448 --> 16:30.492
a fourth for England,

16:31.701 --> 16:34.913
and other ventures
he hath squandered abroad.

16:36.247 --> 16:39.250
But ships are but boards,

16:39.334 --> 16:41.878
sailors are but men,

16:41.961 --> 16:44.631
there be land rats and water rats,

16:44.714 --> 16:47.425
water thieves and land thieves.

16:49.427 --> 16:51.471
I mean pirates.

16:52.722 --> 16:56.351
Then there is the peril of waters,
winds and rocks.

16:56.434 --> 17:00.355
The man is, notwithstanding,
of good credit.

17:02.190 --> 17:03.942
Three thousand ducats.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.529
I think I may take his bond.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.575
- Be assured you may.
- May I speak with Antonio?

17:12.659 --> 17:14.911
If it please you, dine with us.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.038
Yes, to smell pork,

17:17.122 --> 17:21.667
to eat of the habitation which your prophet
the Nazarite conjured the devil into.

17:23.420 --> 17:28.967
I will buy with you, sell with you, walk
with you, talk with you, and so following,

17:29.050 --> 17:31.761
but I will not eat with you,
nor drink with you,

17:31.845 --> 17:33.888
nor pray with you.

17:33.972 --> 17:36.015
Who is he comes here?

17:36.099 --> 17:38.059
This is Signior Antonio. Antonio!

17:38.893 --> 17:40.770
(Bassanio) Antonio.

17:43.857 --> 17:47.068
How like a fawning publican he looks.

17:48.069 --> 17:50.363
Shylock! Shylock, do you hear?

17:51.281 --> 17:54.409
I am debating of my present store,

17:54.492 --> 17:59.039
and by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross

17:59.122 --> 18:01.249
of full three thousand ducats.

18:01.332 --> 18:07.130
But Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
will furnish me.

18:07.213 --> 18:10.425
Benjamin. Go, seek out Tubal.

18:11.676 --> 18:14.095
But soft, how many months?

18:14.179 --> 18:17.182
Rest you fair, good signior.

18:17.265 --> 18:21.061
Your worship was the last man
in our mouths.

18:21.853 --> 18:26.900
- Is he possessed how much you would?
- Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

18:26.983 --> 18:29.027
And for three months.

18:29.110 --> 18:31.988
Ah, I forgot. Three months, you told me so.

18:33.073 --> 18:39.621
But soft, erm... me thought you said
you neither lend nor borrow with interest.

18:40.872 --> 18:44.334
- I do never use it.
- Well.

18:44.417 --> 18:47.629
Three thousand ducats,
'tis a good round sum.

18:59.599 --> 19:01.267
- (Door shuts)
- Launcelot.

19:02.268 --> 19:04.312
The rates.

19:10.151 --> 19:13.196
Three months... from twelve.

19:14.614 --> 19:16.658
Let me see the rate.

19:31.047 --> 19:33.091
Well, Shylock,

19:34.759 --> 19:36.803
shall we be beholden to you?

19:40.014 --> 19:42.267
Signior Antonio...

19:43.309 --> 19:46.813
many a time, and oft in the Rialto,

19:46.896 --> 19:51.401
you have reviled me
about my moneys and my usances.

19:51.484 --> 19:56.072
Still, I have borne it with a patient shrug,

19:56.156 --> 19:59.200
for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.

20:00.535 --> 20:02.370
You call me misbeliever,

20:03.288 --> 20:05.248
cut-throat dog,

20:05.331 --> 20:09.044
and spit upon my Jewish gaberdine.

20:09.127 --> 20:12.881
And all for use of that which is my own.

20:12.964 --> 20:18.887
Well, it now appears you need my help.

20:18.970 --> 20:24.809
You come to me and you say,
"Shylock, we would have money. "

20:24.893 --> 20:30.315
You say so. You, that did void
your rheum upon my beard

20:30.398 --> 20:35.320
and kick me as you spurn a stranger cur
over your threshold.

20:35.403 --> 20:38.448
Money is your suit.
What should I say to you?

20:40.116 --> 20:43.620
Should I not say, "Hath a dog money?

20:44.996 --> 20:49.959
"Is it possible a cur can lend
three thousand ducats?"

20:50.043 --> 20:52.045
Or shall I bend low

20:52.128 --> 20:57.092
and, in a slavish voice, with bated breath
and whispering humbleness say this -

20:57.175 --> 21:00.428
"Fair sir, you spat on me
on Wednesday last,

21:00.512 --> 21:04.349
"you spurned me such a day,
another time you called me dog.

21:04.432 --> 21:07.685
"For these courtesies,
I'll lend you thus much moneys. "

21:07.769 --> 21:11.773
(Antonio) I'm as like to call you so again,
to spit on you again, to spurn you too.

21:11.856 --> 21:15.026
If you would lend this money,
lend it not unto your friends.

21:15.110 --> 21:18.863
For when did friendship take
a breed for barren metal from his friends?

21:18.947 --> 21:21.324
Lend it rather to your enemy who,
if he break,

21:21.408 --> 21:23.702
you may with better face exact the penalty.

21:23.785 --> 21:27.914
Why, look how you storm.
I would be friends with you

21:27.997 --> 21:30.542
and have your love.

21:30.625 --> 21:35.922
Forget the stains
that you have shamed me with.

21:36.798 --> 21:43.763
Supply your present wants, and take not
a drop of interest for my moneys...

21:43.847 --> 21:46.474
- (Sighs)
... and you'll not hear me.

21:46.558 --> 21:49.102
- (Laughs)
- This is kind I offer.

21:51.104 --> 21:53.898
- This is kindness.
- No...

21:53.982 --> 21:57.318
This kindness I will show.

22:00.238 --> 22:03.616
Go with me to a notary

22:03.700 --> 22:07.203
and seal me there your single bond.

22:07.287 --> 22:09.706
And in a merry sport,

22:09.789 --> 22:12.959
if you repay me not on such a day

22:13.043 --> 22:17.589
in such a place, such a sum or sums
as are expressed in the condition,

22:17.672 --> 22:21.384
let the forfeit be nominated...

22:21.468 --> 22:25.930
for an equal pound of your fair flesh

22:27.515 --> 22:31.936
to be cut off and taken

22:32.020 --> 22:35.815
in what part of your body pleaseth me.

22:42.447 --> 22:44.491
(Chuckles)

22:47.660 --> 22:50.038
Content, i'faith.

22:51.414 --> 22:53.666
I'll seal to such a bond,

22:53.750 --> 22:56.753
and say there is much kindness in the Jew.

22:57.587 --> 23:02.842
You shall not seal such a bond for me.
I'd rather live in my necessity.

23:02.926 --> 23:05.178
(Antonio) Why, fear not, man.

23:05.261 --> 23:07.305
I will not forfeit it.

23:07.389 --> 23:10.934
Within these two months,
that's a month before this bond expires,

23:11.017 --> 23:15.230
I do expect return of thrice three times
the value of this bond.

23:16.189 --> 23:19.109
O father Abraham,
what these Christians are,

23:19.192 --> 23:23.363
whose own hard dealings teaches them
suspect the thoughts of others.

23:23.446 --> 23:26.783
I pray you, tell me this.

23:26.866 --> 23:32.330
If he should break his day, what should
I gain by the exaction of the forfeiture?

23:32.414 --> 23:37.127
A pound of a man's flesh taken from a man
is not so estimable,

23:37.210 --> 23:38.920
profitable neither,

23:39.003 --> 23:42.006
as flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

23:44.092 --> 23:50.140
I say, to buy his favour,
I extend this friendship.

23:50.223 --> 23:53.309
If he will take it, so. If not, adieu.

23:53.393 --> 23:56.604
And, for my love, I pray you, wrong me not.

24:00.442 --> 24:02.277
Shylock...

24:03.278 --> 24:05.321
I will seal unto this bond.

24:09.409 --> 24:12.037
(Sizzling)

24:21.254 --> 24:23.882
Dislike me not for my complexion,

24:23.965 --> 24:29.137
the shadowed livery of the burnished sun,
to whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.183
Yallah! Yallah!

24:33.266 --> 24:35.810
Bring me the fairest creature
northward born,

24:35.894 --> 24:39.147
where the sun's fire
scarce thaws the icicles,

24:39.230 --> 24:41.900
and let us make incision for your love

24:41.983 --> 24:45.987
to prove whose blood is reddest,
his or mine.

24:46.071 --> 24:47.989
I tell thee,

24:48.073 --> 24:52.660
lady, this aspect of mine
hath feared the valiant.

24:52.744 --> 24:58.249
Yea, by my love I swear, the most regarded
virgins of our clime have loved it too.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.752
(Men laughing)

25:00.835 --> 25:06.007
I would not change this hue, except
to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

25:08.510 --> 25:13.598
In terms of choice, I am not solely led
by nice direction of a maiden's eyes.

25:13.681 --> 25:18.561
Instead, the lottery of my destiny bars me
the right of voluntary choosing.

25:18.645 --> 25:22.357
But if my father had not restrained me,

25:23.191 --> 25:26.194
and hedged me by his wit
to yield myself as wife

25:26.277 --> 25:28.780
to him who wins me
by that means I told you,

25:30.323 --> 25:33.743
yourself, renowned prince,

25:33.827 --> 25:38.748
then stood as fair as... any comer
I have looked on yet for my affection.

25:38.832 --> 25:42.210
- (Laughter)
- Even for that, I thank you.

25:42.836 --> 25:46.381
Therefore, I pray you, lead me
to the caskets to try my fortune.

25:46.464 --> 25:48.007
(Morocco) Yes?

25:54.013 --> 25:55.598
(Oarsman calls)

25:55.682 --> 26:00.687
(Men talking in Italian)

26:02.272 --> 26:07.444
(Bassanio) I pray you, Leonardo, these
things being bought and orderly bestowed,

26:07.527 --> 26:12.490
return in haste, for I do feast tonight
my best esteemed acquaintance.

26:13.908 --> 26:17.370
Let supper be ready
at the latest by nine o'clock.

26:19.330 --> 26:21.958
See that these letters are delivered.

26:23.168 --> 26:26.087
And put the livery to the making.

26:35.346 --> 26:40.685
Certainly my conscience would forbid me
to run from this Jew, my master.

26:40.769 --> 26:42.437
(Man) Ho!

26:45.607 --> 26:48.651
I pray you, which way to the master Jew's?

26:48.735 --> 26:51.613
Do you not know me, Father?

26:51.696 --> 26:53.907
Lord, how art thou changed!

26:55.450 --> 26:59.579
How dost thou and thy master agree?
I brought him a present.

27:02.665 --> 27:06.252
Famished in his service, Father.
I'm glad you've come.

27:06.336 --> 27:10.131
Give your present to one master Bassanio,

27:10.215 --> 27:14.552
- who indeed gives rare new liveries.
- (Thunder rumbling)

27:19.766 --> 27:21.601
(Man) Si.

27:22.977 --> 27:24.687
Bassanio!

27:26.022 --> 27:27.816
Bassanio!

27:28.650 --> 27:31.194
- Gratiano.
- I have a suit to you.

27:31.277 --> 27:34.614
- You have obtained it.
- You must not deny me -

27:34.698 --> 27:36.950
I must go with you to Belmont.

27:37.992 --> 27:43.331
Why, then you must. But hear thee, you are
too wild, too rude, too bold of voice,

27:43.415 --> 27:48.920
things that become you happily enough
and in such eyes as ours appears not false.

27:49.003 --> 27:55.552
But where you are not known, why,
there they show something too... liberal.

27:55.635 --> 28:01.683
Pray you, take pain to dilute with some
cold drops of modesty your skipping spirit,

28:01.766 --> 28:06.354
lest through your wild behaviour
I be misconstrued in the place I go

28:06.438 --> 28:08.481
and lose my hopes.

28:08.565 --> 28:11.109
Signior Bassanio, hear me.

28:12.652 --> 28:17.866
If I do not put on a sober habit, talk with
respect, and swear but now and then,

28:17.949 --> 28:21.202
look demurely,
nay more, while grace is saying,

28:21.286 --> 28:24.497
hood mine eyes thus with my hat

28:24.581 --> 28:27.709
and sigh and say, "Amen,"
never trust me more.

28:27.792 --> 28:30.754
Well, we shall see your bearing.

28:33.298 --> 28:35.341
(Bassanio) Oof!

28:37.218 --> 28:39.345
Nay, but I bar tonight.

28:40.263 --> 28:43.058
You shall not gauge me
by what we do tonight.

28:43.141 --> 28:44.809
(Bassanio laughs)

28:48.605 --> 28:51.107
God bless your worship.

28:51.191 --> 28:52.901
Signior Bassanio.

28:52.984 --> 28:54.778
Many thanks.

28:54.861 --> 28:57.113
Would you something from me?

28:58.239 --> 29:02.077
- Here is my son, sir, a poor boy.
- Not a poor boy, sir,

29:02.160 --> 29:04.788
but the rich Jew's man that would, sir,

29:05.872 --> 29:07.916
as my father shall specify.

29:07.999 --> 29:11.920
He hath a great infection, sir,
as one would say, to serve.

29:12.003 --> 29:13.922
Indeed, sir. The short and the long is,

29:14.005 --> 29:18.551
I serve the Jew, and have a desire,
as my father shall specify.

29:23.890 --> 29:29.854
To be brief, the very truth is, as my father,
being an old man, shall fruitify unto you...

29:29.938 --> 29:33.525
I have here a dish of doves
I would bestow upon your worship.

29:33.608 --> 29:35.026
(Gobbo) And my suit is...

29:35.110 --> 29:38.530
(Launcelot) In very brief,
the suit is impertinent to myself,

29:38.613 --> 29:41.241
as your worship shall know
by this honest old man.

29:41.324 --> 29:45.370
And, though I say it, though old man,
yet poor man, my father.

29:46.329 --> 29:48.748
One speak for both. What would you?

29:52.419 --> 29:56.214
- Serve you, sir.
- That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

29:56.297 --> 29:58.466
You have obtained your suit,

29:58.550 --> 30:01.761
if it be preferment
to leave a rich Jew's service

30:01.845 --> 30:04.389
to become the follower
of so poor a gentleman.

30:04.472 --> 30:09.144
The old proverb is very well parted
between my master Shylock and you, sir.

30:09.227 --> 30:12.647
You have the grace of God, sir,
and he has enough.

30:12.731 --> 30:14.399
(Laughs)

30:15.233 --> 30:19.863
You speak it well. Give him a livery more
guarded than his fellows'. See it done.

30:34.294 --> 30:36.588
(Thunder)

30:52.812 --> 30:55.357
I'm sorry you will leave my father so.

30:55.440 --> 31:00.320
Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil,
did rob it of some taste of tediousness.

31:03.323 --> 31:07.452
And Launcelot, soon at supper
shall you see Lorenzo,

31:07.535 --> 31:09.871
who is thy new master's guest.

31:09.954 --> 31:11.998
Give him this letter.

31:12.874 --> 31:14.918
Do it secretly.

31:17.295 --> 31:19.130
And so farewell.

31:19.214 --> 31:22.801
I would not have my father
see me talk with thee.

31:26.096 --> 31:28.139
Adieu. (Clears throat)

31:29.641 --> 31:35.689
Tears exhibit my tongue.
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew.

31:41.736 --> 31:48.159
O Lorenzo, if thou keep promise,
I shall end this strife,

31:48.243 --> 31:51.121
becoming Christian and your loving wife.

31:51.204 --> 31:52.956
(Thunder crashes)

31:55.166 --> 31:56.751
(Shylock) Jessica?

31:56.835 --> 31:58.378
(Shylock coughs)

32:05.385 --> 32:07.011
Well.

32:08.596 --> 32:12.934
You will see, your eyes will be the judge,

32:13.017 --> 32:16.062
the difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.

32:17.856 --> 32:22.485
You will not gourmandise with him,
as you have done with me,

32:22.569 --> 32:26.239
nor sleep and snore and wear apparel out.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.825
Not with him.

32:28.908 --> 32:31.911
- Jessica, I say!
- Why, Jessica.

32:31.995 --> 32:34.039
Who bids you call?

32:35.331 --> 32:38.126
I do not bid you call.

32:38.209 --> 32:42.380
Your worship was used to say
I could do nothing without bidding.

32:42.464 --> 32:44.507
- Oh.
- (Door opens)

32:44.591 --> 32:46.426
Call you?

32:48.094 --> 32:51.431
- What's your will?
- I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.

32:51.514 --> 32:53.558
There are my keys.

32:56.811 --> 32:58.855
Wherefore should I go?

33:00.607 --> 33:02.650
I am not bid for love.

33:07.030 --> 33:09.074
Oh, they flatter me.

33:10.950 --> 33:14.496
Yet I will go and feed
upon the prodigal Christian.

33:16.581 --> 33:20.210
Jessica, my girl, look to my house.

33:25.382 --> 33:28.093
Oh, I am right loath to go.

33:28.176 --> 33:29.969
(Bell tolling)

33:30.053 --> 33:34.391
There is some ill a-brewing
towards my rest,

33:36.393 --> 33:41.856
for I did dream of money bags tonight.

33:41.940 --> 33:44.734
I beseech you, sir, go.

33:44.818 --> 33:46.945
My young master expects your reproach.

33:48.405 --> 33:50.365
And so do I his.

33:53.284 --> 33:55.745
And they have conspired together.

33:56.454 --> 33:58.707
I will not say you shall see a masque,

33:58.790 --> 34:02.419
but if you do, it was not for nothing
that my nose fell a-bleeding

34:02.502 --> 34:06.005
on Black Monday last
at six o'clock in the morning.

34:06.089 --> 34:08.382
What, are there masques?

34:10.592 --> 34:13.388
Hear you me, Jessica,

34:13.471 --> 34:16.975
clamber not you up to the casements then,

34:17.058 --> 34:19.893
nor thrust your head into the public street

34:19.978 --> 34:23.690
to gaze on Christian fools
with varnished faces.

34:25.942 --> 34:30.071
Let not the sound of shallow foppery
enter my sober house.

34:32.741 --> 34:37.661
Oh, by Jacob's staff, I swear I have
no mind of feasting forth tonight.

34:40.790 --> 34:43.376
But I will go.

34:43.460 --> 34:48.005
Go you before, sirrah. Say I will come.

34:48.089 --> 34:50.132
I will go before, sir.

34:52.342 --> 34:55.346
Mistress, look out the window for all this.

34:55.429 --> 34:59.184
There will come a Christian boy
will be worth a Jewess' eye.

35:01.394 --> 35:06.024
What says that fool
of Hagar's offspring, ha?

35:08.902 --> 35:13.198
His words were, "Farewell, mistress. "
Nothing else.

35:14.741 --> 35:17.285
(Sighs) The fool is kind enough

35:17.369 --> 35:19.579
but a huge feeder.

35:19.662 --> 35:23.833
Snail-slow in profit,
and he sleeps by day more than a tomcat.

35:25.126 --> 35:28.171
Therefore, I part with him.

35:34.803 --> 35:40.934
Well, Jessica, go in.
Perhaps I will return immediately.

35:41.017 --> 35:43.645
(Thunder rumbling)

35:43.728 --> 35:45.772
Do as I bid you.

35:57.867 --> 35:59.911
(Thunder)

36:02.455 --> 36:07.752
(Sighs) Farewell.
And if my fortune be not crost,

36:07.836 --> 36:10.588
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

36:14.884 --> 36:17.470
(# North African music)

36:20.890 --> 36:23.184
How do I know if I do choose the right?

36:23.268 --> 36:25.979
The one of them
contains my picture, Prince.

36:26.062 --> 36:28.940
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

36:29.024 --> 36:31.568
Some god direct my judgment!

36:34.779 --> 36:37.198
(Speaks in native tongue)

36:38.158 --> 36:39.993
Let me see.

36:41.286 --> 36:45.999
"Who chooseth me
must give and hazard all he hath. "

36:47.333 --> 36:51.004
- (Men) Hmm...
- Must give? For what?

36:51.087 --> 36:53.631
For lead? Hazard for lead?

36:55.508 --> 36:58.553
This casket, my friends, threatens.

36:58.636 --> 37:03.099
Men who hazard all
do it in hope of fair advantages.

37:03.808 --> 37:07.020
A golden mind stoops not
to shows of dross, eh?

37:07.103 --> 37:09.647
(All laugh)

37:09.731 --> 37:13.068
I'll then nor give nor hazard
aught for lead, ah? Mm-mm.

37:13.151 --> 37:14.944
(Spits, laughs)

37:17.697 --> 37:22.077
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
(Chuckles)

37:22.952 --> 37:25.246
"Who chooseth me...

37:25.330 --> 37:28.541
"shall gain as much as he deserves. "

37:30.418 --> 37:32.670
Pause there, Morocco,

37:33.922 --> 37:37.801
and weigh thy value
with an even hand, ha?

37:37.884 --> 37:41.221
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,

37:41.304 --> 37:44.474
and in graces, and in qualities of breeding!

37:44.557 --> 37:46.184
(Gasps)

37:48.436 --> 37:51.231
What if I stray no further but choose here?

37:55.985 --> 37:57.404
Hmm...

38:00.448 --> 38:02.492
"Who chooseth me...

38:03.284 --> 38:05.328
"will gain what many men...

38:06.830 --> 38:08.873
"desire. "

38:08.957 --> 38:11.334
- (Men) Hmm...
- Huh?

38:11.418 --> 38:13.336
Why, that's the lady!

38:13.420 --> 38:16.131
All of the world desires her!

38:16.214 --> 38:20.343
From the four corners of the earth,
they come to kiss this shrine,

38:25.181 --> 38:29.602
Deliver me the key.
Here do I choose, and thrive as I may.

38:30.437 --> 38:32.480
There, take it, Prince.

38:32.564 --> 38:36.192
And if my form lie there, I am yours.

39:56.439 --> 39:58.483
Antonio, good health.

I know the hand. In faith, it is a fair hand,

40:04.072 --> 40:07.575
and whiter than the paper it writ on
is the fair hand that writ.

Lorenzo desired us to make stand?

40:54.581 --> 40:56.750
His hour is almost past.

40:56.833 --> 41:01.463
And it is a marvel he outstays his hour
for lovers always run before the clock.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.631
That ever holds.

Sweet friends,
your patience for my long delay.

Ho! Who's within?

41:27.530 --> 41:30.492
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,

41:30.575 --> 41:33.286
for who I love so much?

41:33.370 --> 41:36.623
And now who knows but you, Lorenzo,
whether I am yours?

41:36.706 --> 41:39.667
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness
that thou art.

41:42.003 --> 41:44.714
Here! Catch this casket.

41:44.798 --> 41:47.092
(All) No!

41:47.175 --> 41:48.802
It is worth the pains.

42:01.773 --> 42:07.904
I'm glad 'tis night. You do not look on me
for I am much ashamed of my disguise.

42:07.987 --> 42:13.618
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit.

42:13.702 --> 42:15.286
(Thunder)

42:15.370 --> 42:17.747
For if they could,
Cupid himself would blush

42:17.831 --> 42:20.458

42:20.542 --> 42:22.752
(Grunting)

42:26.965 --> 42:30.135
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

42:30.218 --> 42:35.223
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
and I should be obscured.

42:35.306 --> 42:40.228
So are you, sweet,
even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

42:40.311 --> 42:43.773
But come at once,
for the close night doth play the runaway.

42:47.944 --> 42:51.906
I will gild myself with some more ducats
and be with you straight.

42:56.494 --> 42:58.621

43:14.179 --> 43:18.224
Contend me, but I love her, heartily.

43:18.308 --> 43:22.854
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,

43:22.937 --> 43:25.899
and fair, she is, if that mine eyes be true

43:25.982 --> 43:28.651
and true she is, as she hath proved herself.

43:28.735 --> 43:32.822
And therefore, like herself,
wise, fair and true,

43:32.906 --> 43:35.408

but stay the very riping of the time.

of thee, let it not enter your mind of love.

to search Bassanio's ship.

He came too late, the ship was under sail.

46:03.098 --> 46:08.561

or he shall pay for this.

46:09.979 --> 46:12.023
Marry, well remembered.

46:13.942 --> 46:16.194
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday

who told me, in the narrow seas
that part the French and English

46:21.157 --> 46:24.703
there miscarried a vessel of our country
richly fraught.

46:24.786 --> 46:30.083

and wished in silence that it were not his.

What news amongst the merchants?

51:48.276 --> 51:51.154

it will feed my revenge.

scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,

53:06.021 --> 53:09.399
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies,
and what's his reason?

53:09.482 --> 53:11.651
I am a Jew!

53:13.319 --> 53:15.488
Hath not a Jew eyes?

If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that.

If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge.

what should his sufferance be

54:13.546 --> 54:15.757
Why, revenge.

and so much to find the thief.

And no satisfaction, no revenge,

56:04.574 --> 56:07.577
no luck stirring

56:07.660 --> 56:10.372
but what lights on my shoulders.

- I am very glad of it.

I'll plague him.

I'll torture him. I am glad of it.

One of them showed me a ring
he had of your daughter

57:51.556 --> 57:53.433
for a monkey.

57:58.646 --> 58:01.024
<i>(Shylock) How dare her!</i>

58:02.567 --> 58:05.695
Tubal, you torture me.

58:05.779 --> 58:07.614
It was my turquoise.

58:07.697 --> 58:12.869
I had it of Leah, her mother,
when I was a bachelor.

58:15.080 --> 58:19.959
I would not have given it away
for a wilderness of monkeys.

58:20.043 --> 58:24.464
But Antonio is certainly undone.

58:27.050 --> 58:29.052
That is true.

58:31.971 --> 58:36.476
Tubal, go, find me an officer.

58:37.310 --> 58:40.188
Bespeak him a fortnight before.

58:41.523 --> 58:44.192
I will have Antonio's heart if he forfeit.

58:46.945 --> 58:50.532
Go, go, Tubal -
at our synagogue, good Tubal.

58:57.288 --> 59:00.125
(Oarsmen) Oh... ehi!

59:02.335 --> 59:05.296
Madam!

59:06.172 --> 59:09.634
There is alighted at your gate
a young Venetian,

59:09.718 --> 59:13.096
one who comes to signify
the approaching of his lord.

59:13.179 --> 59:18.101
I have not seen
so likely an ambassador of love!

59:18.184 --> 59:22.147
A day in April never came so sweet
to show how costly summer was at hand

59:22.230 --> 59:26.192
as this... oh! Forerunner
comes before his lord.

59:26.276 --> 59:30.405
No more, I pray you. I'm half afraid
you will say anon he is some kin to you,

59:30.488 --> 59:33.408
you spin such high-day wit in praising him.

59:34.325 --> 59:36.411
Come. Come, Nerissa,

59:36.494 --> 59:41.499
for I long to see quick Cupid's post
that comes so mannerly.

59:41.583 --> 59:45.295
Bassanio, lord Love, if your will it be.

59:47.047 --> 59:49.132
(Oarsmen shouting)

59:52.427 --> 59:55.638
There's something tells me,
but it is not love.

59:55.722 --> 59:57.974
I would not lose you.

59:58.058 --> 01:00:02.312
And yourself knows
hate counsels not in such a quality.

01:00:26.044 --> 01:00:30.799
<i>(Portia) I would detain you here a month
or two before you venture for me.</i>

01:00:30.882 --> 01:00:33.593
(Sighs) I could teach you
how to choose right

01:00:33.677 --> 01:00:36.763
but then I'd break my oath.

01:00:36.846 --> 01:00:38.890
That will I never do.

01:00:40.266 --> 01:00:42.811
So may you miss me

01:00:42.894 --> 01:00:46.564
and if you do, you make me wish that sin
that I had broke my oath.

01:01:02.706 --> 01:01:05.208
<i>(Portia) Contend me with your eyes</i>

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:08.128
<i>for they have o'erlooked me
and divided me.</i>

01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:24.185
One half of me is yours, the other half
yours, mine own, I would say,

01:01:24.269 --> 01:01:26.521
but if mine, then yours and so...

01:01:26.604 --> 01:01:28.773
all yours.

01:01:37.615 --> 01:01:41.911
Let me choose,
for as I am, I live upon the rack.

01:01:41.995 --> 01:01:44.748
Upon the rack, Bassanio?

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:48.084
Then confess what
treason there is mingled with your love.

01:01:48.168 --> 01:01:51.337
None but that ugly treason of mistrust

01:01:52.922 --> 01:01:55.633
which makes me fear
the enjoying of my love.

01:01:55.717 --> 01:01:58.219
Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack,

01:01:58.303 --> 01:02:00.889
when men enforced do speak anything.

01:02:00.972 --> 01:02:03.183
Promise me life

01:02:03.266 --> 01:02:05.310
and I'll confess the truth.

01:02:05.393 --> 01:02:07.520
Well, then,

01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:10.899
confess and live.

01:02:10.982 --> 01:02:15.737
Confess and love has been
the very sum of my confession.

01:02:18.239 --> 01:02:22.577
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

01:02:24.579 --> 01:02:26.664
Away, then.

01:02:26.748 --> 01:02:29.084
I am locked in one of them.

So may the outward shows
be least themselves.

01:03:34.983 --> 01:03:38.319
The world is still deceived
with ornament.

01:03:39.279 --> 01:03:43.408
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt

01:03:43.491 --> 01:03:49.622
but being seasoned with a gracious voice
obscures the show of evil?

01:03:50.874 --> 01:03:54.044
In religion,

01:03:54.127 --> 01:03:57.922
what damned error
but some sober brow will bless it

01:03:58.006 --> 01:04:00.175
and approve it with a text,

'tis purchased

01:04:21.696 --> 01:04:24.908
by the weight.

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:30.038
Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
I will none of you.

01:04:32.332 --> 01:04:37.045
Nor none of you, O pale and common
drudge between man and man.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.926
But you, O meagre lead,

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:47.514
which rather threatenest
than dost promise aught,

01:04:47.597 --> 01:04:50.266
your paleness moves me more...

01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:55.355
than eloquence.

01:05:02.195 --> 01:05:04.739
Here choose I.

01:05:13.748 --> 01:05:15.792
Joy be the consequence.

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:18.503
O love, be moderate, allay your ecstasy,

01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:22.215
I feel too much your blessing -
make it less for fear I surfeit.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.644
What find I here?

01:05:47.532 --> 01:05:50.702
- Fair Portia's counterfeit.
- (Cheering)

01:05:55.248 --> 01:06:00.378
Oh, what demi-goddess
comes so near creation?

01:06:01.963 --> 01:06:07.510
Move these eyes? Or whether, riding on
the balls of mine, seem they in motion?

01:06:08.845 --> 01:06:12.223
But her eyes -
how could he see to do them?

01:06:13.266 --> 01:06:15.935
But look how far
the substance of my praise

01:06:16.019 --> 01:06:19.356
does wrong this shadow
in underpraising it,

01:06:19.439 --> 01:06:25.278
so far this shadow
doth limp behind the substance.

Here's the scroll -
the continent and summary of my fortune.

Fair lady,

01:07:19.374 --> 01:07:23.837
by your leave, I come by note

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.005
to give.

01:07:31.761 --> 01:07:35.015
And to receive.

01:07:41.646 --> 01:07:43.732
Like one of two contending in a prize

01:07:43.815 --> 01:07:46.443
That thinks he has done well
in people's eyes

01:07:46.526 --> 01:07:49.154
Hearing applause and universal shout

01:07:49.237 --> 01:07:52.198
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt

01:07:52.282 --> 01:07:55.827
As doubtful whether what I see be true

01:07:56.828 --> 01:08:01.249
Until confirmed, signed, ratified

01:08:01.332 --> 01:08:03.626
by you

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:06.129
(Applause)

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.970
You see me, lord Bassanio,
where I stand, such as I am.

01:08:16.348 --> 01:08:17.807
Though for myself alone

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:22.228
I would not be ambitious in my wish
to wish myself much better,

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.814
yet for you,

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:29.361
I would be treble twenty times myself.

01:08:31.696 --> 01:08:35.283
A thousand times more fair,

01:08:35.367 --> 01:08:37.410
ten thousand times more rich,

01:08:37.493 --> 01:08:43.124
that only to stand high in your account,
I might in virtues, beauties,

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:47.127
livings, friends,

01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:50.298
exceed account.

01:08:51.758 --> 01:08:54.386
But the full sum of me

01:08:54.469 --> 01:08:58.139
is sum of something
which, to term in gross,

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:02.018
is an unlessoned girl,

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:06.022
unschooled, unpractised.

01:09:08.942 --> 01:09:12.444
Happy in this,
she is not yet so old that she may learn.

01:09:13.863 --> 01:09:18.118
Happier than this,
she is not bred so dull that she may learn.

01:09:20.203 --> 01:09:22.247
Happiest of all,

01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:27.585
is that her gentle spirit
commits itself to yours to be directed

01:09:29.129 --> 01:09:31.423
as by her governor,

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:33.383
her lord,

01:09:34.968 --> 01:09:37.136
her king.

01:09:41.433 --> 01:09:45.437
This house, these servants,

01:09:46.563 --> 01:09:49.024
and this same myself

01:09:50.108 --> 01:09:52.318
are yours,

01:09:52.402 --> 01:09:54.446
my lord's.

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:03.121
I give them with this ring,

01:10:04.372 --> 01:10:09.794
which when you part from,
lose or give away,

01:10:14.007 --> 01:10:17.010
let it presage the ruin of your love.

01:10:20.847 --> 01:10:23.224
And give me vantage to exclaim on you.

01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.317
Madam,

01:10:33.568 --> 01:10:36.696
you have bereft me of all words.

01:10:38.907 --> 01:10:41.576
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,

01:10:41.659 --> 01:10:45.205
there is such confusion in my powers.

01:10:47.749 --> 01:10:52.337
But when this ring parts from this finger

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.258
then parts life from hence -

01:10:57.342 --> 01:11:01.471
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead.

01:11:05.725 --> 01:11:07.894
(Cheering)

01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:24.411
(Clears throat)

01:11:24.494 --> 01:11:28.123
My lord Bassanio, my gentle lady,

01:11:28.206 --> 01:11:31.167
I wish you all the joy that you can wish

01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:35.088
and when your honours mean to solemnize
the bargain of your faith,

01:11:35.171 --> 01:11:41.094
I do beseech you even at that time,
I may be married, too.

01:11:46.683 --> 01:11:49.477
With all my heart.

01:11:49.561 --> 01:11:52.105
If you can get a wife.

01:11:52.188 --> 01:11:55.483
I thank you, your lordship,
you have got me one.

01:11:55.567 --> 01:11:58.278
My eyes, my lord,
can look as swift as yours.

01:11:59.362 --> 01:12:02.824
You saw the mistress,

01:12:04.826 --> 01:12:06.953
I beheld the maid.

01:12:07.037 --> 01:12:09.247
Is it true, Nerissa?

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:12.125
- Madam, it is!
- Oh!

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:14.836
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:17.130
Yes, faith, my lord.

01:12:18.757 --> 01:12:22.010
Our feast shall be much honoured
in your marriage.

01:12:26.639 --> 01:12:28.892
(Cheering)

01:12:33.396 --> 01:12:37.901
We'll play with them
the first boy for a thousand ducats.

01:12:37.984 --> 01:12:40.653
- What, with stake down?
- No.

01:12:40.737 --> 01:12:43.948
We shall never win at that sport
with stake down.

01:12:44.032 --> 01:12:46.576
(Laughter)

01:12:46.659 --> 01:12:50.330
(Man) Ho, there! Ho!

01:12:52.832 --> 01:12:55.001
But who comes here?

01:13:08.848 --> 01:13:12.185
There are some shrewd contents
in yond same paper,

01:13:12.268 --> 01:13:15.563
that do steal the colour
from Bassanio's cheek.

01:13:15.647 --> 01:13:20.151
Some dear friend dead, else nothing
in the world could turn the constitution

01:13:20.235 --> 01:13:22.278
of any constant man.

01:13:22.362 --> 01:13:24.948
What, worse and worse!

01:13:30.704 --> 01:13:32.914
With leave, Bassanio,

01:13:32.997 --> 01:13:36.042
I am half yourself

01:13:36.126 --> 01:13:40.839
and I must freely have half of anything
that this same letter brings you.

01:13:40.922 --> 01:13:42.549
O sweet Portia,

01:13:42.632 --> 01:13:47.220
they are a few of the unpleasantest words
that ever blotted paper.

01:13:51.224 --> 01:13:54.561
Gentle lady,

01:13:54.644 --> 01:13:58.648
when I did first impart my love to you,

01:13:58.732 --> 01:14:02.235
I freely told you
all the wealth I had ran in my veins -

01:14:02.318 --> 01:14:05.447
I was a gentleman and then I told you true.

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:08.366
And yet, dear lady,

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:11.453
rating myself at nothing,

01:14:12.287 --> 01:14:15.540
you shall see how much I was a braggart.

01:14:15.623 --> 01:14:18.209
When I told you my estate was nothing,

01:14:20.795 --> 01:14:23.423
I should have told you
I was worse than nothing,

01:14:23.506 --> 01:14:28.178
for, indeed, I have engaged myself
to a dear friend,

01:14:28.261 --> 01:14:31.306
who engaged my dear friend
to his mere enemy

01:14:33.516 --> 01:14:35.643
to feed my means.

01:14:36.895 --> 01:14:41.816
Here is a letter, lady.
The paper is the body of my friend

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:45.528
and every word in it a gaping wound
issuing life-blood.

01:14:45.612 --> 01:14:51.117
But is it true, Salerio? What,
all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?

01:14:51.201 --> 01:14:54.204
From Tripolis, from Mexico, from England?

01:14:54.287 --> 01:14:56.039
Not one, my lord.

01:14:56.122 --> 01:15:00.085
Besides it appears that if he had
the present money to discharge the Jew,

01:15:00.168 --> 01:15:02.504
he would not take it.

01:15:02.587 --> 01:15:06.966
He plies the duke at morning and at night
and doth impeach the freedom of the state

01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:08.677
if they deny him justice.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.679
Twenty merchants, the duke himself

01:15:10.762 --> 01:15:14.683
and the magnificoes of greatest port
have all persuaded with him

01:15:14.766 --> 01:15:20.647
but none can drive him from the envious
plea of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.277
When I was with him,

01:15:26.361 --> 01:15:30.532
I have heard him swear
to Tubal and to Cush, his countrymen,

01:15:30.615 --> 01:15:33.743
that he would rather have Antonio's flesh

01:15:33.827 --> 01:15:37.330
than twenty times the value of the sum
that he did owe him.

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:40.834
And I know, my lord,

01:15:40.917 --> 01:15:43.795
if law, authority and power deny not,

01:15:46.506 --> 01:15:48.633
it will go hard with poor Antonio.

01:15:51.928 --> 01:15:54.931
Is it your dear friend
that is thus in trouble?

01:15:55.015 --> 01:15:57.058
The dearest friend to me.

01:16:00.103 --> 01:16:02.439
What sum owes he the Jew?

01:16:03.648 --> 01:16:06.276
For me, three thousand ducats.

01:16:07.986 --> 01:16:09.696
No more?

01:16:10.572 --> 01:16:13.283
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond.

01:16:13.366 --> 01:16:16.244
Double six thousand and then treble that

01:16:16.327 --> 01:16:22.125
before a friend of this description should
lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.

01:16:24.335 --> 01:16:27.047
Let me hear the letter of your friend.

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:33.928
"Sweet Bassanio, my ships have
all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,

01:16:34.012 --> 01:16:36.181
"my estate is very low.

01:16:38.058 --> 01:16:43.021
"My bond to the Jew is forfeit and since
in paying it, it is impossible I should live,

01:16:43.104 --> 01:16:46.649
"all debts are cleared between you and I,

01:16:46.733 --> 01:16:49.569
"if I might but see you at my death.

01:16:49.652 --> 01:16:51.738
"Notwithstanding, use your pleasure -

01:16:53.281 --> 01:16:57.702
"if love do not persuade you to come,
let not my letter. "

01:16:59.871 --> 01:17:01.915
O love,

01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:06.878
dispatch all business and be gone!

01:17:06.961 --> 01:17:09.005
First...

01:17:10.215 --> 01:17:12.967
go with me to church and call me wife.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.514
Then away to Venice, to your friend.

01:17:20.183 --> 01:17:24.521
<i>For never shall you lie by Portia's side
with an unquiet soul.</i>

01:17:26.106 --> 01:17:29.484
<i>You shall have gold to pay
the petty debt twenty times over.</i>

01:17:29.567 --> 01:17:34.614
<i>When it is paid,
bring your true friend along.</i>

01:17:36.574 --> 01:17:41.329
<i>Meantime, myself and Nerissa
will live as maids and widows.</i>

01:17:44.165 --> 01:17:46.292
<i>Come, away,</i>

01:17:46.376 --> 01:17:49.004
<i>for you shall hence</i>

01:17:49.087 --> 01:17:51.214
<i>upon your wedding day.</i>

01:18:08.356 --> 01:18:12.485
Gaoler, look to him, tell me not of mercy.

01:18:12.569 --> 01:18:17.741
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Gaoler, look to him.

01:18:17.824 --> 01:18:19.784
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

01:18:19.868 --> 01:18:23.913
I'll have my bond.
Speak not against my bond.

01:18:23.997 --> 01:18:27.125
I have sworn an oath
that I will have my bond.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:30.128
You called me dog before you had a cause.

01:18:30.211 --> 01:18:32.964
But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.

01:18:33.048 --> 01:18:35.759
The duke will grant me justice.

01:18:35.842 --> 01:18:37.886
I do wonder, you wicked gaolers,

01:18:37.969 --> 01:18:41.473
you are so fond
to come abroad with him at his request.

01:18:41.556 --> 01:18:44.142
- I pray you, hear me speak!
- I'll have my bond,

01:18:44.225 --> 01:18:45.894
I will not hear you speak.

01:18:45.977 --> 01:18:48.813
I'll have my bond, therefore speak no more.

01:18:48.897 --> 01:18:52.233
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,

01:18:52.317 --> 01:18:59.240
to shake their head, relent and sigh
and yield to Christian intercessors.

01:18:59.324 --> 01:19:01.368
I'll have no speaking, follow not.

01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:05.622
I will have my bond.

01:19:06.748 --> 01:19:10.627
It is the most impenetrable cur
that ever kept with men.

01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:12.754
Let him alone.

01:19:15.048 --> 01:19:18.468
I'll follow him no more
with bootless prayers.

01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:23.807
He seeks my life.

01:19:25.517 --> 01:19:27.602
His reason well I know.

01:19:29.813 --> 01:19:33.608
I'm sure the duke will never grant
this forfeiture to hold!

01:19:33.692 --> 01:19:36.277
The duke cannot deny the course of law.

01:19:36.361 --> 01:19:40.949
For the commodity that strangers have
with us in Venice, if it be denied,

01:19:41.032 --> 01:19:43.660
will much impeach the justice of the state.

01:19:45.704 --> 01:19:47.872
Therefore, go.

01:19:51.668 --> 01:19:54.129
Oh!

01:19:54.212 --> 01:19:57.841
These griefs and losses have so bated me

01:19:57.924 --> 01:20:02.220
that I shall hardly find a pound of flesh
tomorrow for my bloody creditor.

01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:09.352
Pray God Bassanio come
to see me pay his debt.

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:13.231
Then I care not.

01:20:24.951 --> 01:20:28.079
Madam, if you knew
to whom you show this honour,

01:20:28.163 --> 01:20:30.707
how true a gentleman you send relief,

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:33.752
how dear a lover of my lord your husband,

01:20:33.835 --> 01:20:38.506
I know you would be prouder of the work
than customary kindness would allow you.

01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:41.551
I never did repent for doing good,
I shall not now.

01:20:41.634 --> 01:20:44.971
For in companions that do
converse and waste the time together

01:20:45.055 --> 01:20:50.518
there needs must be a like proportion
of lineaments, of manners and of spirit.

01:20:51.728 --> 01:20:57.984
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
being the bosom lover of my lord,

01:20:58.068 --> 01:21:00.487
must needs be like my lord.

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:03.948
If it be so, how little
is the cost I have bestowed

01:21:04.032 --> 01:21:08.912
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out of this state of hellish cruelty.

01:21:09.788 --> 01:21:12.123
This comes too near
the praising of myself.

01:21:12.207 --> 01:21:14.709
Therefore, no more of it. Hear other things.

01:21:14.793 --> 01:21:19.047
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
the husbandry and manage of my house

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:20.507
until my lord's return.

01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:24.094
For my own part, I have towards heaven
breathed a secret vow

01:21:24.177 --> 01:21:27.806
to live in prayer and contemplation,
only attended by Nerissa here,

01:21:27.889 --> 01:21:31.434
- until my husband and her lord's return.
- Madam, with all my heart,

01:21:31.518 --> 01:21:33.561
I shall obey you in all fair commands.

01:21:33.645 --> 01:21:36.648
Fair thoughts and happy hours
attend on you.

01:21:36.731 --> 01:21:41.319
Go, speed to Padua, render this
into my cousin's hands, old Bellario.

01:21:41.403 --> 01:21:42.946
Go!

01:21:50.787 --> 01:21:53.540
Is it not so, cousin Bellario?

01:21:53.623 --> 01:21:55.667
(# Lute music)

01:22:08.054 --> 01:22:13.226
# How sweet the rose... #

01:22:13.309 --> 01:22:16.312
See, Jessica.

01:22:16.396 --> 01:22:22.902
Look how the floor of heaven is
thick inlaid with patterns of bright gold.

01:22:24.529 --> 01:22:29.868
Is not the smallest orb that you behold
but in his motion like an angel sings?

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:38.084
Such harmony is in immortal souls.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.923
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
doth grossly close it in,

01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:46.009
- we cannot hear it.
- Hm.

01:22:47.135 --> 01:22:49.804
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

01:22:51.598 --> 01:22:54.184
The reason is your spirits are attentive.

01:22:54.267 --> 01:22:56.811
The man that hath no music in himself

01:22:56.895 --> 01:23:00.148
nor is not moved
with concord of sweet sounds

01:23:00.231 --> 01:23:03.943
is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.

01:23:04.027 --> 01:23:07.155
The motions of his spirit are
as dull as night

01:23:07.238 --> 01:23:10.033
and his affections are as dark as Erebus.

01:23:11.409 --> 01:23:14.913
Let no such man be trusted.

01:23:14.996 --> 01:23:17.082
Mark the music.

01:23:18.208 --> 01:23:22.712
# Sweet rose... #

01:23:23.797 --> 01:23:27.300
(Portia) We shall see our husbands
before they think of us.

01:23:27.384 --> 01:23:29.302
Shall they see us?

01:23:29.386 --> 01:23:31.471
They shall, Nerissa,

01:23:31.554 --> 01:23:36.351
but in such a habit that they shall think
we are accomplished with what we lack.

01:23:37.268 --> 01:23:41.731
I'll hold you any wager, when we are both
accoutred like young men,

01:23:41.815 --> 01:23:44.484
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two.

01:23:58.164 --> 01:24:01.001
(Duke) Go one and call the Jew
to the court.

01:24:04.087 --> 01:24:06.673
Make room and let him stand
before our face.

01:24:15.015 --> 01:24:16.558
He is come, my lord.

01:24:35.618 --> 01:24:40.331
Shylock, the world thinks,
and I think so, too,

01:24:40.415 --> 01:24:45.337
that you but lead'st this fashion
of your malice to the last hour of the act

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:49.299
and then 'tis thought
you'll show your mercy and remorse,

01:24:49.382 --> 01:24:53.803
more strange than is
your strange apparent cruelty.

01:24:55.513 --> 01:24:57.307
What say you, Jew?

01:24:57.390 --> 01:25:00.060
We all expect a gentle answer.

01:25:00.143 --> 01:25:04.356
I have informed your grace
of what I purpose

01:25:05.648 --> 01:25:12.405
and by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
to have the due and forfeit of my bond.

01:25:12.489 --> 01:25:15.033
If you deny it,

01:25:16.201 --> 01:25:20.580
let the danger light upon your charter
and your city's freedom.

01:25:22.165 --> 01:25:27.837
You'll ask me why I rather choose
to have a weight of human flesh

01:25:27.921 --> 01:25:31.007
than to receive three thousand ducats.

01:25:31.091 --> 01:25:33.176
I'll not answer that.

01:25:33.259 --> 01:25:36.638
But, say, it is my humour - is it answered?

01:25:39.474 --> 01:25:42.519
What if my house be troubled by a rat

01:25:42.602 --> 01:25:46.648
and I am pleased to give
ten thousand ducats to have it killed?

01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:50.735
- What, are you answered yet?
- (Crowd) No.

01:25:50.819 --> 01:25:53.571
Some men there are love not a gaping pig,

01:25:53.655 --> 01:25:55.907
some that are mad if they behold a cat

01:25:55.990 --> 01:26:00.912
and others when the bagpipe sings
in the nose cannot contain their urine.

01:26:00.995 --> 01:26:05.375
- (Laughter)
- For affection, master of passion, sways it

01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:08.128
to the mood of what it likes or loathes.

01:26:08.211 --> 01:26:10.046
Now for your answer.

01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:15.635
As there is no firm reason to be rendered
why he cannot abide a gaping pig,

01:26:15.719 --> 01:26:19.014
why he, a harmless, necessary cat,

01:26:19.097 --> 01:26:21.349
why he a woollen bagpipe,

01:26:21.433 --> 01:26:24.310
but of force must yield
to such inevitable shame

01:26:24.394 --> 01:26:26.896
as to offend himself being offended,

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.107
so can I give no reason,

01:26:29.190 --> 01:26:30.942
nor will I not,

01:26:31.026 --> 01:26:37.782
more than a lodged hate
and a certain loathing I bear Antonio,

01:26:37.866 --> 01:26:41.536
that I follow thus
this losing suit against him.

01:26:43.705 --> 01:26:46.166
- Are you answered?
- (All) No!

01:26:52.088 --> 01:26:57.427
This is no answer, you unfeeling man,
to excuse the current of your cruelty.

01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:00.972
I am not bound to please you
with my answers.

01:27:01.056 --> 01:27:03.683
Do all men kill the things they do not love?

01:27:04.601 --> 01:27:07.562
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

01:27:09.022 --> 01:27:11.649
Every offence is not a hate at first.

01:27:11.733 --> 01:27:14.444
You would have a serpent sting you twice?

01:27:14.527 --> 01:27:16.654
(Crowd shout in derision)

01:27:16.738 --> 01:27:18.907
I pray you,

01:27:20.492 --> 01:27:23.703
think you question with the Jew:

01:27:26.873 --> 01:27:29.542
You may as well go stand upon the beach

01:27:30.794 --> 01:27:35.465
and bid the main flood lower
its usual height.

01:27:37.342 --> 01:27:38.760
(Sighs)

01:27:38.843 --> 01:27:43.640
You may as well question with the wolf

01:27:43.723 --> 01:27:47.018
why he has made
the ewe bleat for the lamb.

01:27:48.978 --> 01:27:52.107
You may as well do anything most hard

01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:54.734
as seek to soften that

01:27:56.861 --> 01:27:59.864
than which what's harder, his Jewish heart.

01:28:02.033 --> 01:28:06.413
Therefore I do beseech you, make
no more offers, use no farther means,

01:28:06.496 --> 01:28:09.708
but with all just and plain conveniency
let me have judgment

01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:11.918
and the Jew his will.

01:28:12.002 --> 01:28:14.212
(All) No! No!

01:28:15.171 --> 01:28:18.174
You loaned three thousand ducats.

01:28:21.052 --> 01:28:23.263
Here is six.

01:28:27.142 --> 01:28:29.352
(Crowd gasps)

01:28:45.744 --> 01:28:51.166
If every ducat in six thousand ducats

01:28:51.249 --> 01:28:55.962
were in six parts and every part a ducat

01:28:57.130 --> 01:29:01.718
I would not draw them,
I would have my bond.

01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:04.763
(Duke) How shall you hope for mercy,
giving none?

01:29:04.846 --> 01:29:08.475
What judgment should I fear,
doing no wrong?

01:29:08.558 --> 01:29:11.936
You have among you
many a purchased slave,

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:14.856
which like your asses
and your dogs and mules,

01:29:14.939 --> 01:29:19.444
you use in abject and in slavish parts
because you bought them.

01:29:19.527 --> 01:29:21.738
Shall I say to you, let them be free?

01:29:22.655 --> 01:29:24.866
Marry them to your heirs.

01:29:25.575 --> 01:29:28.119
Why sweat they under burdens?

01:29:28.203 --> 01:29:30.997
Let their beds be made as soft as yours.

01:29:32.165 --> 01:29:36.336
Their palates seasoned with your food.

01:29:36.419 --> 01:29:40.590
You will answer, "The slaves are ours. "

01:29:40.674 --> 01:29:42.884
So do I answer you.

01:29:42.967 --> 01:29:48.056
The pound of flesh that I demand of him

01:29:48.139 --> 01:29:50.183
is dearly bought.

01:29:52.268 --> 01:29:54.229
'Tis mine.

01:29:56.106 --> 01:29:58.983
'Tis mine!

01:30:00.568 --> 01:30:02.278
'Tis mine.

01:30:04.489 --> 01:30:06.908
And I will have it.

01:30:06.991 --> 01:30:12.038
If you deny me, fie upon your law.

01:30:14.749 --> 01:30:18.712
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

01:30:20.046 --> 01:30:22.716
I stand for judgment.

01:30:23.842 --> 01:30:26.052
Answer.

01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:30.056
- Shall I have it?
- (Crowd gasp)

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:32.017
(Crowd shouting)

01:30:34.978 --> 01:30:37.397
Silence! Silence!

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:41.401
Silence! Upon my power
I may dismiss this court

01:30:41.484 --> 01:30:45.447
unless Bellario, a learned doctor
that I have sent for to determine this,

01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:49.200
- come here today.
- My lord!

01:30:49.284 --> 01:30:52.454
Here stays without a messenger
with letters from the doctor

01:30:52.537 --> 01:30:53.788
new come from Padua.

01:30:59.878 --> 01:31:02.422
Come you from Padua, from old Bellario?

01:31:02.505 --> 01:31:05.842
From both, my lord.
Bellario greets your grace.

01:31:06.926 --> 01:31:09.262
Why do you whet your knife so earnestly?

01:31:09.346 --> 01:31:12.307
To cut the forfeiture
from that bankrupt there.

01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:14.267
Can no prayers pierce you?

01:31:14.351 --> 01:31:17.437
No, none that you have
wit enough to make.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.817
Be you damned, inexecrable dog
and for your life let justice be accused.

01:31:22.901 --> 01:31:25.403
Till you can rail the seal from off my bond,

01:31:25.487 --> 01:31:28.031
you but offend your lungs
to speak so loud.

01:31:29.366 --> 01:31:33.328
Prepare your wit, good youth,
or it will fall to cureless ruin.

01:31:33.411 --> 01:31:35.622
I stand here for law.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.543
- I stand for law!
- Silence! Silence!

01:31:40.627 --> 01:31:42.504
(Crowd quietens)

01:31:43.672 --> 01:31:48.218
This letter does commend
a young and learned doctor to our court.

01:31:48.301 --> 01:31:50.762
- Well, where is he?
- He attendeth here hard by

01:31:50.845 --> 01:31:53.139
to know your answer,
whether you'll admit him.

01:31:53.223 --> 01:31:55.642
Go, give him
courteous conduct to this place.

01:31:55.725 --> 01:31:59.354
Meantime, the court
shall hear Bellario's letter.

01:31:59.437 --> 01:32:03.858
"Your grace shall understand that
at the receipt of your letter, I am very sick

01:32:03.942 --> 01:32:08.238
"but in the instant your messenger came
there was with me a young doctor of Rome

01:32:08.321 --> 01:32:09.948
"whose name is Balthasar.

01:32:10.031 --> 01:32:12.992
"He comes at my asking to take my place.

01:32:13.076 --> 01:32:16.329
"I beseech you,
let his lack of years be no impediment,

01:32:16.413 --> 01:32:19.624
"for I never knew so young a body
with so old a head.

01:32:19.708 --> 01:32:22.419
"I leave him to your gracious acceptance. "

01:32:22.502 --> 01:32:28.758
You heard Bellario, what he writes.
Oh, and here, I take it, is the doctor come.

01:32:30.552 --> 01:32:32.804
You are welcome.

01:32:32.887 --> 01:32:34.973
Take your place.

01:32:36.808 --> 01:32:41.604
Are you acquainted with the difference that
holds this present question in the court?

01:32:41.688 --> 01:32:44.274
I am informed thoroughly of the case.

01:32:44.357 --> 01:32:47.193
Which is the merchant here
and which the Jew?

01:32:47.277 --> 01:32:49.654
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

01:32:56.036 --> 01:33:01.333
- Is your name Shylock?
- Shylock is my name.

01:33:11.843 --> 01:33:14.929
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,

01:33:15.013 --> 01:33:19.559
yet in such rule that the Venetian law
cannot deny you as you do proceed.

01:33:21.686 --> 01:33:25.815
- You stand within his power, do you not?
- Ay, so he says.

01:33:25.899 --> 01:33:29.361
- Do you confess the bond?
- I do.

01:33:31.196 --> 01:33:34.199
Then must the Jew be merciful.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.620
On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.

01:33:38.703 --> 01:33:41.081
The quality of mercy is not strained,

01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:47.796
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath.

01:33:49.172 --> 01:33:51.174
It is twice blessed -

01:33:51.257 --> 01:33:54.594
it blesseth him that gives
and him that takes.

01:33:55.345 --> 01:33:58.765
'Tis mightiest in the mighty.

01:33:58.848 --> 01:34:03.728
It becomes the throned monarch
better than his crown.

01:34:03.812 --> 01:34:07.065
His sceptre shows the force
of temporal power,

01:34:07.148 --> 01:34:13.154
the attribute to awe and majesty wherein
doth sit the dread and fear of kings.

01:34:14.823 --> 01:34:19.744
But mercy is above this sceptred sway.

01:34:21.162 --> 01:34:24.749
It is enthroned in the heart of kings.

01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:28.962
It is an attribute to God himself

01:34:30.213 --> 01:34:33.800
and earthly power doth then show
likest God's

01:34:33.883 --> 01:34:36.052
when mercy seasons justice.

01:34:39.305 --> 01:34:44.561
Therefore, Jew,
though justice be your plea,

01:34:44.644 --> 01:34:48.189
consider this.

01:34:48.273 --> 01:34:52.402
That in the course of justice,
none of us should see salvation.

01:34:53.653 --> 01:34:55.905
We do pray for mercy

01:34:55.989 --> 01:35:04.289
and that same prayer doth teach us all
to render the deeds of mercy.

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:11.296
I have spoke thus much
to mitigate the justice of your plea,

01:35:11.379 --> 01:35:15.383
which if you follow
this strict course of Venice

01:35:15.467 --> 01:35:18.595
must needs give sentence
against the merchant there.

01:35:20.805 --> 01:35:23.266
My deeds upon my head.

01:35:25.143 --> 01:35:27.187
I crave the law,

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:30.648
the penalty and forfeit of my bond.

01:35:31.983 --> 01:35:37.447
- Is he not able to discharge the money?
- Yes, here I tender it for him in court,

01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:39.157
yea, twice the sum.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:42.535
If that is not enough,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er

01:35:42.619 --> 01:35:44.829
on forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart!

01:35:44.913 --> 01:35:49.209
If this is not enough it must appear
that malice bears down on truth.

01:35:49.292 --> 01:35:52.087
I beseech you,
wrest once the law to your authority -

01:35:52.170 --> 01:35:55.965
to do a great right, do a little wrong
and curb this cruel devil of his will.

01:35:56.049 --> 01:36:00.929
It must not be. There is no power in Venice
can alter a decree established.

01:36:01.012 --> 01:36:03.056
'Twill be recorded for a precedent

01:36:03.139 --> 01:36:06.434
and many an error of the same example
will rush into the state.

01:36:06.518 --> 01:36:10.647
- It cannot be.
- A Daniel come to judgment.

01:36:11.523 --> 01:36:13.733
Yea, a Daniel.

01:36:16.111 --> 01:36:19.239
O wise young judge, how I do honour you.

01:36:19.322 --> 01:36:22.200
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

01:36:23.076 --> 01:36:26.788
Most reverend doctor, here it is.

01:36:48.393 --> 01:36:53.314
Shylock, there is twice the money
offered you.

01:36:53.398 --> 01:36:55.984
An oath, an oath.

01:36:57.444 --> 01:37:00.363
I have an oath in heaven.

01:37:00.447 --> 01:37:03.533
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

01:37:03.616 --> 01:37:06.328
No. Not for Venice.

01:37:10.832 --> 01:37:13.877
Why, this bond is forfeit

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.672
and lawfully at this time
the Jew may claim a pound of flesh

01:37:17.756 --> 01:37:21.718
to be by him cut off
nearest the merchant's heart.

01:37:23.428 --> 01:37:25.263
Be merciful.

01:37:25.347 --> 01:37:29.059
Take twice your money,
bid me tear the bond.

01:37:29.142 --> 01:37:32.687
When it is paid, according to the terms.

01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:39.527
Most heartily I do beseech the court

01:37:41.279 --> 01:37:43.740
to give the judgment.

01:37:49.954 --> 01:37:52.165
(Whispering)

01:37:59.881 --> 01:38:06.179
Then thus it is. You must prepare
your bosom for his knife.

01:38:06.262 --> 01:38:11.309
O noble judge, excellent young man.

01:38:11.393 --> 01:38:15.522
For the intent and purpose of the law
has full relation to the penalty

01:38:15.605 --> 01:38:18.066
which here appeareth due upon the bond.

01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:21.695
'Tis very true, O wise and upright judge.

01:38:21.778 --> 01:38:24.781
How much more elder are you
than you look.

01:38:24.864 --> 01:38:28.660
- Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
- Ay, his breast.

01:38:28.743 --> 01:38:31.955
So says the bond, does it not,
noble judge?

01:38:32.038 --> 01:38:34.374
Nearest the heart.

01:38:34.457 --> 01:38:37.335
- Those are the very words.
- It is so.

01:38:39.212 --> 01:38:41.756
Are there balances here
to weigh the flesh?

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.760
I have them here.

01:38:47.637 --> 01:38:49.222
(Crowd gasp)

01:39:02.110 --> 01:39:03.695
(Knife unsheathing)

01:39:03.778 --> 01:39:06.197
Have by some surgeon, Shylock,
on your charge

01:39:06.281 --> 01:39:10.285
to stop his wounds
lest he should bleed to death.

01:39:12.203 --> 01:39:14.914
Is it so nominated in the bond?

01:39:15.874 --> 01:39:20.420
It is not so expressed but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

01:39:20.503 --> 01:39:24.507
I cannot find it. 'Tis not in the bond.

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:33.892
You, merchant, have you anything to say?

01:39:34.934 --> 01:39:36.603
But little.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.692
I am armed and well prepared.

01:39:45.236 --> 01:39:48.323
Give me your hand, Bassanio.

01:39:53.078 --> 01:39:55.580
Fare thee well.

01:39:56.706 --> 01:39:59.417
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you.

01:40:00.919 --> 01:40:05.215
For herein doth Fortune show herself
more kind than is her custom.

01:40:05.298 --> 01:40:08.968
Commend me to thy honourable wife.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.181
Tell her the process of Antonio's end.

01:40:16.309 --> 01:40:20.897
Say how I loved you,
speak me fair in death.

01:40:22.565 --> 01:40:24.943
And when the tale is told,

01:40:25.026 --> 01:40:28.988
bid her be judge
whether Bassanio had not once a love.

01:40:30.782 --> 01:40:34.285
Repent but you
that you shall lose your friend

01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:39.082
and you repent not that he pays your debt.

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:44.129
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough

01:40:44.212 --> 01:40:47.674
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.

01:40:50.552 --> 01:40:55.348
Antonio, I am married to a wife

01:40:56.683 --> 01:41:00.645
which is as dear to me as life itself.

01:41:00.729 --> 01:41:06.026
But life itself, my wife and all the world

01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:10.113
are not with me esteemed above your life.

01:41:12.323 --> 01:41:17.954
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all,
here to this devil

01:41:19.331 --> 01:41:21.541
to deliver you.

01:41:22.751 --> 01:41:27.088
I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love -

01:41:27.172 --> 01:41:32.135
I would she were in heaven,
so she could entreat some power

01:41:32.218 --> 01:41:33.928
to change this cursed Jew!

01:41:34.012 --> 01:41:36.681
I have a daughter!

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.478
Would that any of the stock of Barrabas
been her husband

01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:44.481
rather than a Christian.

01:41:44.564 --> 01:41:49.486
We trifle time. I pray you, pursue sentence.

01:41:51.363 --> 01:41:53.323
You may proceed.

01:41:54.491 --> 01:41:58.662
A pound of that same
merchant's flesh is yours.

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:02.874
The court awards it
and the law does give it.

01:42:02.957 --> 01:42:04.042
Most rightful judge.

01:42:04.167 --> 01:42:07.879
And you must cut this flesh
from off his breast.

01:42:07.962 --> 01:42:12.217
The court awards it and the law allows it.

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:14.219
Most learned judge.

01:42:15.178 --> 01:42:17.305
A sentence.

01:42:18.807 --> 01:42:20.100
Come.

01:42:21.726 --> 01:42:23.353
(Shylock) Prepare.

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:40.495
(Prays)

01:42:57.846 --> 01:43:00.890
- Tarry a little!
- Aah!

01:43:03.309 --> 01:43:05.437
There is something else.

01:43:08.106 --> 01:43:12.527
This bond does give you here
no drop of blood.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:18.033
The words expressly are a pound of flesh.

01:43:20.410 --> 01:43:23.872
Take then your bond,
take then your pound of flesh,

01:43:23.955 --> 01:43:29.377
but in the cutting of it,
if you do shed one drop of Christian blood,

01:43:31.796 --> 01:43:35.967
your lands and goods
are by the laws of Venice confiscate

01:43:36.051 --> 01:43:37.719
unto the state of Venice.

01:43:37.802 --> 01:43:39.888
O upright judge!

01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:43.224
Mark, Jew. Learned judge!

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:47.479
Is that the law?

01:43:47.562 --> 01:43:50.315
Yourself shall see the act.

01:43:50.398 --> 01:43:53.193
For as you urge on justice,

01:43:53.276 --> 01:43:57.822
be assured you shall have justice
more than you desire.

01:44:04.537 --> 01:44:06.206
Well.

01:44:08.667 --> 01:44:11.753
I take the offer, then.

01:44:14.798 --> 01:44:16.841
Pay the bond twice

01:44:16.925 --> 01:44:19.219
and let the Christian go.

01:44:20.095 --> 01:44:24.432
- Here is the money.
- Soft. The Jew shall have all justice.

01:44:24.516 --> 01:44:28.311
No haste. He shall have nothing
but the penalty.

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:30.605
(Crowd murmurs)

01:44:30.689 --> 01:44:33.441
Therefore, prepare you to cut off the flesh.

01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:36.736
Shed then no blood

01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:42.492
nor cut you less nor more
but just a pound of flesh.

01:44:42.575 --> 01:44:45.245
If you take more or less than a just pound

01:44:45.328 --> 01:44:48.081
be it but so much
as makes it light or heavy

01:44:48.164 --> 01:44:53.128
in the substance or division
of the twentieth part of one poor scruple,

01:44:53.211 --> 01:44:58.591
nay, if the scale do turn
but in the estimation of a hair,

01:45:00.844 --> 01:45:03.013
you die

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:05.765
and all your goods are confiscate.

01:45:05.849 --> 01:45:09.019
- (Gratiano) A second Daniel!
- (Laughter)

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:12.272
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip!

01:45:12.355 --> 01:45:14.649
Why does the Jew pause?

01:45:16.484 --> 01:45:21.156
Shall I not have even my principal?

01:45:21.239 --> 01:45:25.368
You shall have nothing but your forfeiture,
to be so taken at your peril, Jew.

01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:29.706
Why, then the devil give him good of it.

01:45:29.789 --> 01:45:32.292
- I'll stay no longer question.
- Tarry, Jew.

01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:35.420
The law has yet another hold on you.

01:45:36.046 --> 01:45:38.506
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,

01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:44.429
if it be proved against an alien
that by direct or indirect attempts

01:45:44.512 --> 01:45:46.598
he seek the life of any citizen,

01:45:46.681 --> 01:45:51.686
the party 'gainst which he does contrive
shall seize one half of his goods.

01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:56.816
The other half comes
to the privy coffer of the state

01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:04.074
and the offender's life
lies in the mercy of the Duke only,

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:06.493
'gainst all other voice.

01:46:14.751 --> 01:46:17.212
In which predicament, I say you stand.

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:22.967
Down, therefore,

01:46:26.054 --> 01:46:29.182
and beg mercy of the Duke.

01:46:41.111 --> 01:46:44.906
Beg that you may have leave
to hang yourself.

01:46:47.909 --> 01:46:52.497
(Duke) That you shall see the difference
in our spirit, I pardon you your life

01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:54.332
before you ask it.

01:46:54.416 --> 01:47:00.088
For half your wealth, it is Antonio's, the
other half shall come to the general state.

01:47:04.134 --> 01:47:08.430
Nay, take my life and all -

01:47:08.513 --> 01:47:10.557
pardon not that.

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:18.523
You take my house when you take the prop
that doth sustain my house.

01:47:20.442 --> 01:47:24.279
You take my life

01:47:24.362 --> 01:47:27.699
when you take the means whereby I live.

01:47:29.326 --> 01:47:31.703
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

01:47:31.786 --> 01:47:35.081
A halter gratis,
nothing else, for God's sake.

01:47:36.166 --> 01:47:42.881
So please my lord the Duke
and all the court

01:47:45.133 --> 01:47:47.886
forego the fine of one half of his goods.

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:54.559
I am content so he will let me use
the other half, in trust,

01:47:56.936 --> 01:47:59.230
relinquish it upon his death

01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:04.819
unto the gentleman
that lately stole his daughter.

01:48:08.198 --> 01:48:10.950
One thing provided more,
that, for this favour,

01:48:13.411 --> 01:48:16.289
he shall presently become a Christian.

01:48:20.335 --> 01:48:22.671
(Contained sobbing)

01:48:28.927 --> 01:48:32.472
(Duke) He shall do this
or else I do recant the pardon

01:48:32.555 --> 01:48:35.350
I late pronounced here.

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:45.026
(Portia) Are you contented, Jew?

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:54.703
What do you say?

01:48:54.786 --> 01:48:56.663
Oh...

01:48:57.539 --> 01:48:59.541
I am contented.

01:48:59.624 --> 01:49:04.337
Clerk, prepare a deed of gift.

01:49:06.881 --> 01:49:10.593
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence.

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:13.847
I... I am not well.

01:49:15.557 --> 01:49:19.978
I will... Send a deed after me
and I will sign it.

01:49:20.061 --> 01:49:22.897
Get you gone, then, but do it.

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.364
Court dismissed.

01:50:07.776 --> 01:50:09.444
(Sighs)

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:16.201
- (Giggles)
- Most worthy gentleman,

01:50:16.284 --> 01:50:18.662
I and my friend have by your wisdom

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:21.915
been this day acquitted
of most grievous penalties,

01:50:21.998 --> 01:50:26.544
in lieu whereof, three thousand ducats,
due unto the Jew

01:50:26.628 --> 01:50:29.130
we freely pay your courteous pains withal.

01:50:29.214 --> 01:50:33.176
- Mm.
- And stand indebted, over and above,

01:50:33.259 --> 01:50:36.012
in love and service to you ever more.

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.766
He is well paid that is well satisfied

01:50:39.849 --> 01:50:41.935
and I, delivering you, am satisfied

01:50:42.018 --> 01:50:45.355
and therein do account myself well paid -
fare you well.

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:48.108
Dear sir, of force
I must attempt you further.

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:52.904
Take some remembrance of us,
as a tribute, not as a fee.

01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:56.074
Run me two things, I pray you.

01:50:56.157 --> 01:50:59.494
Not to deny me and to pardon me.

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:04.874
You press me far, therefore I will yield.

01:51:09.379 --> 01:51:14.676
Give me your gloves.
I'll wear them for your sake.

01:51:15.802 --> 01:51:20.223
And for your love,
I'll take this ring from you.

01:51:20.306 --> 01:51:24.436
Do not draw back your hand,
I'll take no more,

01:51:24.519 --> 01:51:27.397
and you, in love, shall not deny me this.

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.027
This ring... Good sir, alas, it is a trifle,
I would not shame myself to give you this.

01:51:32.110 --> 01:51:34.529
I will have nothing else but only this.

01:51:34.612 --> 01:51:39.075
There's more depends on this
than on the value.

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:43.747
The dearest ring in all of Venice will I give
to you, and find it out by proclamation,

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:46.458
only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

01:51:48.418 --> 01:51:50.045
Oh, I see, sir.

01:51:50.128 --> 01:51:54.007
You are liberal in offers,
you taught me first to beg,

01:51:54.090 --> 01:51:57.969
and now methinks you teach me
how a beggar should be answered.

01:51:58.053 --> 01:52:00.930
This ring was given me by my wife.

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:02.724
Oh!

01:52:02.807 --> 01:52:07.687
And when she put it on she made me vow
that I should neither sell nor give

01:52:08.730 --> 01:52:10.231
nor lose it.

01:52:10.315 --> 01:52:13.068
That 'scuse serves many men
to save their gifts

01:52:13.151 --> 01:52:15.362
and if your wife be not a madwoman,

01:52:15.445 --> 01:52:18.782
then know her well
I have deserved this ring.

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:22.661
She would not hold out enemy forever
for giving it to me.

01:52:22.744 --> 01:52:25.497
My lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.

01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:28.416
Let not his deserving and my love as well

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.503
be valued 'gainst
your wife's commandment.

01:52:41.513 --> 01:52:45.975
Enquire the Jew's house out.
Give him this deed and let him sign it.

01:52:46.059 --> 01:52:51.231
Ho! My lord Bassanio upon more advice
has sent you here this ring.

01:52:51.314 --> 01:52:53.566
He does entreat your company at dinner.

01:52:54.651 --> 01:52:56.820
That cannot be.

01:52:56.903 --> 01:53:02.242
His ring I do accept most thankfully.

01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:05.912
I pray you tell him.

01:53:06.663 --> 01:53:11.042
Furthermore, I pray you show my youth
to old Shylock's house.

01:53:11.126 --> 01:53:13.962
(Chuckles) That will I do.

01:53:14.045 --> 01:53:19.467
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring which
I did make him swear to keep forever.

01:53:39.446 --> 01:53:42.949
(# Countertenor singing)

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:55.754
(Lorenzo) Dear ladies, welcome home.

01:53:55.837 --> 01:53:58.882
(Portia) We have been praying
for our husbands' welfare,

01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:02.552
whose speed
we hope the better for our words.

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:26.660
This night, methinks,
is but the daylight sick.

01:54:26.743 --> 01:54:28.912
It looks a little paler.

01:54:30.413 --> 01:54:34.626
'Tis a day such as the day is
when the sun is hid.

01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:37.295
- (Man) Ho!
- Peace.

01:54:43.635 --> 01:54:46.012
You're welcome home, my lord.

01:54:46.096 --> 01:54:49.683
I thank you, madam.
Give welcome to my friend.

01:54:49.766 --> 01:54:53.311
This is the man, this is Antonio
to whom I am so infinitely bound.

01:54:53.395 --> 01:54:56.147
You should in all sense
be much bound to him,

01:54:56.231 --> 01:54:58.566
for as I hear he was much bound for you.

01:54:58.650 --> 01:55:01.236
No more than I am well acquitted of.

01:55:02.779 --> 01:55:05.407
Sir, you are welcome to our house.

01:55:05.490 --> 01:55:11.246
It must appear in other ways than words
so I cut short this breathing courtesy.

01:55:19.170 --> 01:55:23.091
By yonder moon,
I swear you do me wrong.

01:55:23.174 --> 01:55:25.802
In faith I gave it to the judge's clerk.

01:55:25.885 --> 01:55:28.304
Would he were gelded
that had it, for my part,

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:30.765
since you do take it, love,
so much at heart.

01:55:30.849 --> 01:55:33.309
A quarrel, ho, already? What's the matter?

01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:37.522
About a hoop of gold,
a paltry ring that she did give me,

01:55:37.605 --> 01:55:43.153
whose motto was for all the world
like cutler's poetry upon a knife.

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:46.197
"Love me and leave me not. "

01:55:46.281 --> 01:55:49.117
(Nerissa) What talk you of the motto
or the value?

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.786
You swore to me when I did give it you

01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:54.581
that you would wear it
till your hour of death

01:55:54.664 --> 01:55:57.876
and that it should lie with you
in your grave.

01:55:57.959 --> 01:56:00.837
Though not for me
yet for your vehement oaths

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:04.382
you should have been respective
and have kept it.

01:56:04.466 --> 01:56:08.970
- Gave it to a judge's clerk!
- I gave it to a youth,

01:56:09.054 --> 01:56:13.933
a kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
no higher than thyself, the judge's clerk.

01:56:14.017 --> 01:56:17.187
You were to blame,
I must be plain with you,

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:20.482
to part so slightly with your wife's first gift.

01:56:21.441 --> 01:56:26.112
I gave my love a ring
and made him swear never to part with it.

01:56:26.196 --> 01:56:28.365
And here he stands.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.745
I dare be sworn for him,
he would not lose it

01:56:33.828 --> 01:56:39.209
nor pluck it from his finger
for all the wealth that the world masters.

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:44.506
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
and swear I lost the ring defending it.

01:56:44.589 --> 01:56:47.008
- My lord Bassanio gave his ring away.
- Hm?

01:56:47.092 --> 01:56:50.720
Unto the judge that begged it
and indeed deserved it, too.

01:56:53.014 --> 01:56:57.477
And then the boy, his clerk, that took
some pain in writing, he begged mine

01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:01.564
and neither man nor master
would take aught but the two rings.

01:57:03.233 --> 01:57:05.694
If I could add a lie onto a fault
I would deny it

01:57:05.777 --> 01:57:11.825
but you see my finger
has not the ring upon it, it is... gone.

01:57:11.908 --> 01:57:17.497
Even so void is your false heart of truth.

01:57:20.083 --> 01:57:23.586
By heaven, I will ne'er come into your bed
until I see the ring.

01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:26.131
Nor I in yours till I again see mine.

01:57:27.549 --> 01:57:32.929
Sweet Portia, if you did know
to whom I gave the ring,

01:57:33.013 --> 01:57:35.265
if you did know for whom I gave the ring,

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:37.851
and would conceive
for what I gave the ring

01:57:37.934 --> 01:57:43.857
and how unwillingly I left the ring when
nought would be accepted but the ring,

01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:47.652
you would abate the strength
of your displeasure.

01:57:47.736 --> 01:57:52.407
If you had known the virtue of the ring

01:57:54.534 --> 01:57:57.954
or half her worthiness
who did give the ring,

01:57:58.038 --> 01:58:01.541
or your own honour to contain the ring,

01:58:01.624 --> 01:58:05.545
you would not then
have parted with the ring.

01:58:05.628 --> 01:58:08.006
Nerissa teaches me what to believe.

01:58:08.089 --> 01:58:10.675
I'll die for it but some woman has that ring.

01:58:10.759 --> 01:58:14.596
No, by honour, madam,
by my soul, no woman had it

01:58:14.679 --> 01:58:16.723
but a civil doctor,

01:58:16.806 --> 01:58:20.268
which did refuse three thousand ducats
of me and begged the ring

01:58:20.352 --> 01:58:23.521
the which I did refuse him,
and suffered him, displeased, to go away,

01:58:23.605 --> 01:58:28.151
even he that had held up
the very life of my dear friend.

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:31.196
What should I say, sweet lady?

01:58:34.949 --> 01:58:36.826
I was enforced to send it after him.

01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:39.412
Let not that doctor come near my house.

01:58:39.496 --> 01:58:46.044
Since he has got the jewel that I loved and
that which you did swear to keep for me,

01:58:46.127 --> 01:58:50.757
I will become as liberal as you -

01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:54.386
I'll not deny him anything I have.

01:58:54.469 --> 01:58:58.682
No, not since my body,
nor my husband's bed,

01:58:58.765 --> 01:59:00.892
know him I shall, I am sure of that.

01:59:00.975 --> 01:59:04.688
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong

01:59:04.771 --> 01:59:10.610
and in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to you, even by thine own fair eyes,

01:59:10.694 --> 01:59:13.989
I never more will break an oath with thee.

01:59:14.072 --> 01:59:17.283
(Antonio) I once did lend my body
for his wealth.

01:59:17.367 --> 01:59:21.579
I dare be bound again,
my soul upon the forfeit,

01:59:22.831 --> 01:59:25.417
that your lord...

01:59:28.044 --> 01:59:31.172
will never more break faith advisedly.

01:59:32.799 --> 01:59:37.262
Then you shall be his surety.

01:59:38.388 --> 01:59:40.515
Give him this.

01:59:40.598 --> 01:59:44.978
- (Sighs)
- And bid him keep it better

01:59:45.061 --> 01:59:47.397
than the other.

01:59:51.067 --> 01:59:54.237
My lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.

02:00:01.911 --> 02:00:05.749
By heaven, 'tis the same I gave the doctor.

02:00:05.832 --> 02:00:09.294
I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,

02:00:11.504 --> 02:00:15.467
for, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:19.554
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,

02:00:19.637 --> 02:00:22.515
for that same scrubbed boy,
the doctor's clerk,

02:00:22.599 --> 02:00:26.436
in lieu of this last night did lie with me.

02:00:31.107 --> 02:00:32.233
Why...

02:00:32.317 --> 02:00:33.985
(Giggling)

02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:38.031
This is like
the mending of the highways in summer,

02:00:38.114 --> 02:00:41.409
when the ways are fair enough.

02:00:43.995 --> 02:00:48.375
What, are we cuckolds
ere we have deserved it?

02:00:48.458 --> 02:00:50.627
Speak not so grossly.

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:53.797
You are all amazed.

02:00:55.507 --> 02:00:58.134
Bassanio...

02:00:58.218 --> 02:01:03.223
Here is a letter,
it comes from Padua, from old Bellario.

02:01:07.435 --> 02:01:12.857
There you shall read
that Portia was the doctor,

02:01:14.651 --> 02:01:16.903
Nerissa there her clerk.

02:01:18.071 --> 02:01:21.533
Lorenzo here shall witness
I set forth as soon as you

02:01:21.616 --> 02:01:23.785
and only just now returned.

02:01:30.875 --> 02:01:35.338
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

02:01:40.552 --> 02:01:44.597
Were you the clerk
that is to make me a cuckold?

02:01:44.681 --> 02:01:50.729
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it
unless he live to be a man.

02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:56.276
Sweet doctor,

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.654
you shall be my bedfellow.

02:02:00.613 --> 02:02:04.284
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:14.127
How now, Lorenzo?

02:02:14.210 --> 02:02:17.630
My clerk has some good comforts too
for you.

02:02:17.714 --> 02:02:23.928
Ay, there do I give to you and Jessica
from the rich Jew

02:02:24.012 --> 02:02:29.809
a special deed of gift after his death
of all he dies possessed of.

02:02:29.893 --> 02:02:31.811
(Lorenzo) Oh!

02:02:32.937 --> 02:02:37.233
Fair ladies, you drop manna
in the way of starved people.

02:02:42.072 --> 02:02:45.241
It is almost morning

02:02:45.325 --> 02:02:51.331
and yet, I am sure you are not satisfied
with these events at full.

02:02:54.292 --> 02:02:55.960
Let us go in.

02:02:57.587 --> 02:03:00.590
And I will answer all things faithfully.

02:03:09.933 --> 02:03:12.060
Well, let it be so.

02:03:13.895 --> 02:03:17.315
The first inter'gatory
that my Nerissa shall be sworn on is

02:03:17.399 --> 02:03:21.778
whether till the next night
she had rather stay or go to bed now,

02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:23.863
being two hours today.

02:03:23.947 --> 02:03:26.449
But were the day come,
I should wish it dark

02:03:26.533 --> 02:03:29.327
till I were couching the doctor's clerk.

02:03:30.161 --> 02:03:36.960
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

02:03:37.043 --> 02:03:39.212
(Giggling)

02:03:40.255 --> 02:03:48.263
# The world was all before them

02:03:48.346 --> 02:03:55.645
# Ah

02:03:55.729 --> 02:04:03.778
# Where to choose their place of rest

02:04:03.862 --> 02:04:10.827
# Ah

02:04:11.619 --> 02:04:15.498
# And Providence their guide

02:04:15.582 --> 02:04:19.336
# They hand in hand

02:04:19.419 --> 02:04:27.010
# Took their wand'ring steps

02:04:27.093 --> 02:04:31.014
# And slow

02:04:31.097 --> 02:04:35.143
# Through Eden

02:04:35.226 --> 02:04:42.359
# Took their solitary way

02:04:42.817 --> 02:04:48.323
# Ah... #

02:05:49.634 --> 02:05:54.347
# The ring is on my hand

02:05:54.431 --> 02:05:59.060
# And the wreath is on my brow

02:05:59.144 --> 02:06:03.440
# Satin and jewels grand

02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:09.529
# Are all at my command

02:06:09.612 --> 02:06:15.702
# And I am happy now

02:06:19.998 --> 02:06:24.461
# And my lord, he loves me well

02:06:24.544 --> 02:06:28.381
# But when first he breathed his vow

02:06:28.465 --> 02:06:32.427
# I felt my bosom swell

02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:36.848
# For the words rang as a knell

02:06:36.931 --> 02:06:41.102
# And the voice seemed his who fell

02:06:41.186 --> 02:06:45.398
# In the battle down the dell

02:06:45.482 --> 02:06:51.321
# And who is happy now

02:06:53.657 --> 02:06:57.952
# But he spoke to reassure me

02:06:58.036 --> 02:07:02.207
# And he kissed my pallid brow

02:07:02.290 --> 02:07:06.127
# While a reverie came o'er me

02:07:07.087 --> 02:07:10.465
# And to the churchyard bore me

02:07:10.548 --> 02:07:14.511
# And I sighed to him before me

02:07:15.303 --> 02:07:18.848
# Thinking him dead D'Elormie

02:07:18.932 --> 02:07:23.978
# "Oh, I am happy now!"

02:07:44.749 --> 02:07:46.876
# Ah...

02:08:01.307 --> 02:08:06.855
# And I am happy now

02:08:09.316 --> 02:08:13.695
# And thus the words were spoken

02:08:13.778 --> 02:08:17.657
# And this the plighted vow

02:08:17.741 --> 02:08:21.619
# And though my faith be broken

02:08:21.703 --> 02:08:26.124
# And though my heart be broken

02:08:26.207 --> 02:08:30.253
# Here is a ring, as token

02:08:30.337 --> 02:08:36.009
# That I am happy now

02:08:38.678 --> 02:08:43.141
# Would God I could awaken

02:08:43.224 --> 02:08:46.686
# For I dream I know not how

02:08:46.770 --> 02:08:51.149
# And my soul is sorely shaken

02:08:51.232 --> 02:08:55.153
# Lest an evil step be taken

02:08:55.236 --> 02:08:59.699
# Lest the dead who is forsaken

02:08:59.783 --> 02:09:05.330
# May not be happy now

02:09:08.416 --> 02:09:13.004
# Ah... #

02:11:26.221 --> 02:11:28.264
