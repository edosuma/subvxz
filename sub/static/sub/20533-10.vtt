WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:03.879
Previously, on 90210...
DIXON: You think just because
you cheated on me

00:03.921 --> 00:05.213
that you'll be able
to walk out

00:05.255 --> 00:06.507
of my new company?
I own you.

00:06.548 --> 00:07.925
We loved each other once.

00:07.967 --> 00:10.135
If I could ask for
one gift from you,

00:10.177 --> 00:11.428
it'd be to stop torturing me.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.847
You know, maybe we should
skip the presents this year.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.055
Megan,

00:14.097 --> 00:15.975
about your-your dad
and the accident--

00:16.015 --> 00:18.310
I was in the other car.
That's how I got hurt.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.854
I thought
you'd hate me.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.814
Where is this coming from?

00:21.856 --> 00:23.315
No talking.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.192
I'd like to be
our child's father.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.945
That's really sweet, but it...
it wasn't in the plan.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.947
You can't ask him to give up
the right to be a parent

00:29.989 --> 00:31.239
to his own child,
so unless you want

00:31.281 --> 00:34.326
to take this seriously,
we're gonna take you to court.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.619
They voted to fire me.
What?

00:35.661 --> 00:37.120
Thanks to you not listening
to me,

00:37.162 --> 00:39.456
I have nothing
and no one but you.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.041
NAOMI:
"I have to think. Went to the

00:41.082 --> 00:42.793
gamer conference in Iceland."

00:42.835 --> 00:45.128
I get paid to protect you so
you can have some semblance

00:45.170 --> 00:46.755
of a normal life.
I'm sorry.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.799
I keep feeling like someone's
lurking around, ready

00:48.841 --> 00:50.300
to pounce. Guess someone's been
watching me for months.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.760
Now this creep wants money?

00:51.802 --> 00:53.387
Make the drop,
I'll videotape the whole thing.

00:53.428 --> 00:56.015
It's the only way
to find out who's doing this.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.225
Vanessa? You're still alive?

00:58.266 --> 00:59.518
That's who sent
me the letter.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.896
I got to go see Vanessa.
I can't let you do that.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.480
(grunting)

01:03.522 --> 01:04.522
Well, if you didn't
do anything to him,

01:04.565 --> 01:05.566
then where the hell is Liam?

01:05.607 --> 01:08.777
(loud grunting)

01:12.406 --> 01:14.449
(grunting)

01:17.411 --> 01:19.371
(loud grunt)

01:19.413 --> 01:21.415
(panting)

01:23.417 --> 01:25.794
Have we calmed down
enough to eat?

01:29.924 --> 01:32.760
I'm sorry. I know this stings.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.053
(gasps)

01:34.093 --> 01:35.387
Uncuff me.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.931
I told you,
this is only temporary

01:36.972 --> 01:39.474
until I can be 100% sure
you're no longer in danger.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.018
I am in danger now.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.895
You have me shackled to a pipe!

01:42.937 --> 01:45.606
For your own safety
and protection.
(sighs)

01:45.647 --> 01:48.609
You have a long history of
trusting the wrong people, Liam.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.779
You would be running back to
Vanessa if I hadn't stopped you.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.364
Now open up for oatmeal.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.991
(sighs)

01:56.033 --> 01:58.410
Until now, I thought
Vanessa was dead.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.371
Don't lie to me.

02:01.413 --> 02:05.042
You were on your way to meet her
with a backpack full of money.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.668
She obviously has her
hooks in you again.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.920
She was blackmailing me.
I just didn't know it was her!

02:08.963 --> 02:12.132
And at what point did you tell
the security officer assigned

02:12.173 --> 02:14.301
for your protection
that you were being blackmailed?

02:14.342 --> 02:16.386
(sighs)

02:16.428 --> 02:18.013
(sighs)

02:18.055 --> 02:20.015
Liam, you need to trust me.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.643
Well, see, you know
what doesn't inspire trust?

02:22.684 --> 02:25.395
A cop that knocks me out
and ties me up!

02:28.023 --> 02:30.109
I'm not just a cop.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.154
I'm your biggest fan.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.032
Tattoo guy didn't quite capture

02:37.074 --> 02:39.701
those bedroom eyes,
but it'll do.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.536
I have to go run
some errands.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.872
Hopefully, your appetite
will return when I do.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.582
(sighs)

02:52.965 --> 02:54.173
(metallic clanking)

02:54.215 --> 02:56.301
(grunting)

02:58.219 --> 02:59.805
(grunting)

03:07.270 --> 03:09.773
(sighs)

03:09.815 --> 03:11.190
(laughs)

03:11.232 --> 03:12.400
Hey.
Hi.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.819
Uh... wow.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.403
(laughs)

03:15.445 --> 03:16.613
Right?

03:16.655 --> 03:18.699
(laughs)

03:18.740 --> 03:20.283
Are you hungry?
Mm.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.077
Yes? I could whip up breakfast.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.370
Oh.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.413
Um, except I wasn't
expecting company,

03:25.455 --> 03:27.749
so I think
all I have is frozen pizza.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.251
Well, I happen to love
pizza for breakfast.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.171
Perfect.
Yeah.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.381
You do heat it up,
though, right? Yeah?

03:34.422 --> 03:36.842
Oh, yeah. For you,
oh, yeah. Got you.
Okay.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.927
(loud footsteps approaching)

03:38.969 --> 03:40.512
Dixon, we need to talk!

03:41.638 --> 03:43.015
(clears throat)
Um...

03:43.057 --> 03:44.474
(clearing her throat)

03:44.516 --> 03:45.976
Megan, this is Ade.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.269
Adrianna, this is Megan.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.437
Seriously?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.523
Yeah. I'll be right back.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.985
Hey... we broke up,

03:55.027 --> 03:57.029
so why are you barging
into my house?

03:57.071 --> 03:59.322
Okay, well, I thought we
should discuss the new material

03:59.364 --> 04:00.949
that you want me to sing at the
label launch party tonight.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.367
I didn't know
you'd be so busy.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.078
It's a song.
What's there to discuss?

04:04.119 --> 04:07.206
Um, I don't know. For starters,
it's called "Scarlet A-drianna."

04:07.247 --> 04:08.916
Dixon,

04:08.957 --> 04:10.918
what happened with Taylor
was a mistake.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.878
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.922
But you did.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.630
Okay, that type of thing
doesn't just go away.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.675
Look, you signed a contract.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.010
You have no choice.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.636
I'm sorry.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.181
(scoffs)

04:26.767 --> 04:28.435
(door slams shut)

04:28.476 --> 04:31.063
Hey. Um, you know,
sorry about that.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.232
Hell hath no fury
like an angry ex.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.110
Wait. Uh, you going?

04:36.151 --> 04:39.196
I should probably go.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.866
Um, I'll-I'll see you around,
Dixon.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.826
W-Wait. Uh...

04:44.868 --> 04:46.870
(door closes)

04:46.912 --> 04:49.831
I was gonna make pizza.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.459
(knocking)

04:57.839 --> 05:00.884
Hey. Got a second?

05:00.926 --> 05:03.887
Actually, didn't know if I'd
see you again after last night.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.431
Yeah. Shane was
a bit out of line.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.143
It wasn't his place to say
we should hire lawyers.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.019
I am so happy
to hear you say that.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.229
But he's right.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.106
(sighs)

05:14.148 --> 05:17.025
Three months ago, you were fine
just being the donor.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.860
Well, my
situation's changed,

05:18.902 --> 05:21.905
and having a kid
seems possible now.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.824
I'm not trying to
stop you from having

05:23.865 --> 05:25.492
this child, but I want
to be the father.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.660
And if you can't accept that,

05:26.701 --> 05:28.328
then we're gonna have
to take it to court.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.746
Is this just Shane talking?

05:29.788 --> 05:30.998
This isn't Shane, this is me.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.833
And you can't do anything
without my consent.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.168
Do you not understand

05:34.209 --> 05:36.044
how important
this is to me?

05:36.086 --> 05:39.173
Yeah, I do, because
it's important to me, too.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.841
But so is saving
our friendship.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.050
Silver, the mistake

05:42.092 --> 05:44.636
we made was not going
through the proper process.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.014
I just think it's probably best
that we only talk

05:47.055 --> 05:49.516
through lawyers until we can
come up with a compromise.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.147
(door closes)

05:56.731 --> 05:59.318
(sighs)

06:05.949 --> 06:07.951
(sighs)

06:09.953 --> 06:11.955
(sighs)

06:16.626 --> 06:19.420
(door opens, footsteps approach)

06:19.462 --> 06:21.589
ADRIANNA:
Ugh! I'm so glad you're home.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.550
Me, too! I...
I've just been

06:23.591 --> 06:26.427
enjoying some me time since Max
has been away on a conference.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.222
Would you like an
everything bagel?

06:28.263 --> 06:30.765
I never get to eat them
because Max is allergic to...

06:30.807 --> 06:32.226
well, everything,
and I love everything.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.228
Bagel.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.437
Okay, when you ramble
like this, something's wrong.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.898
Nothing's wrong.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.900
No. I'm fine.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.819
Max and I had a tiny
little spat before he left,

06:42.861 --> 06:46.156
but everything, including my
little bagel, is just fine.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.033
Well, I'm not fine.
I'm pissed.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.328
Dixon is sleeping with some girl
to try to get under my skin.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.871
Um, considering what
you did with Taylor,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.582
you're lucky he isn't using
the Laker girls to get even.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.000
And I mean all of them.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.377
(scoffs)
Yeah, okay. Well, sleeping

06:58.417 --> 07:01.004
with a random girl isn't all
that Dixon's doing.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.673
For the past week,
I have been like his puppet.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.508
"Change your hair."
"Dress sluttier."

07:05.550 --> 07:07.010
"Sing a song about a whore."

07:07.052 --> 07:09.804
Oh, my God, I love
a good whore song.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.806
I know what I did
was truly awful,

07:11.848 --> 07:13.808
but I'm already
beating myself up over it.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.103
I don't need his help.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.229
(sighs)

07:17.271 --> 07:18.397
Hey, you know what?

07:18.479 --> 07:20.941
Stewing over a guy never
did any girl any good.

07:20.982 --> 07:24.945
I think we should take a drive
along the coast today.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.863
(sighs)
I wish.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.116
It's Dixon's label launch party
tonight.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.617
Hmm.
You know what?

07:30.658 --> 07:32.953
And he's probably gonna use it
as an opportunity

07:32.994 --> 07:34.495
to torture me with that tramp.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.124
Well, I just so happen to be
lending my house to Dixon

07:37.165 --> 07:39.376
for his little party,
so he can lend me you.

07:39.418 --> 07:42.254
We'll hit the open road,
leave all our drama behind us.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.256
It'll be like
Thelma &amp; Louise.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.466
Minus the Grand Canyon
suicide dive, of course.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.051
Okay. I'm in.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.720
And if we happen to find
a young Brad Pitt on the way,

07:50.762 --> 07:51.888
I will not complain.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.514
(laughs)

07:53.556 --> 07:56.435
(laughter)

07:56.476 --> 07:59.313
(theme music playing)

08:14.494 --> 08:16.537
(laughter
and indistinct chatter)

08:17.914 --> 08:19.416
(both sigh)

08:19.458 --> 08:21.335
I haven't had such
a dramatic breakup

08:21.376 --> 08:23.170
since Dewey Mitchell
in the fifth grade.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.671
Do you remember him?

08:24.712 --> 08:28.425
He got so heartbroken,
he vom'd on my notebook.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.469
Spewy Dewey!
Yes.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.886
Oh, my God, and then we
toilet-papered his house

08:32.929 --> 08:34.431
to get back at him.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.265
Oh, remember?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.893
I slept over, and we crept into
the neighbor lady's backyard

08:38.934 --> 08:40.312
and went skinny-dipping
in her pool.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.438
Yeah, and she was supposed
to be out of town,

08:42.481 --> 08:44.358
and then the old bag
came out of nowhere

08:44.399 --> 08:46.943
and chased me down Roxbury Drive
with a garden rake.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.112
(laughter)

08:49.154 --> 08:50.364
Oh, my God.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.572
Oh.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.283
(sighs)
(laughs)

08:53.325 --> 08:56.036
You know, my guesthouse has
been empty since Ivy left.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.329
I'm just saying,

08:57.371 --> 08:59.373
it would be a 24/seven
slumber party if you moved in.

08:59.414 --> 09:04.419
What? I would totally love that.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.005
But don't you think
you should maybe ask Max first?

09:07.047 --> 09:10.717
Yeah. No, no. I mean, obviously,
I will when we talk.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.511
And he'll totally be cool
with it.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.388
He will love it.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.181
Oh, hot springs.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.933
Think we're a little overdue
for that skinny-dip.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.143
What do you say?

09:20.185 --> 09:22.854
I think, in honor of my crazy
neighbor and her rake...

09:22.896 --> 09:25.190
(laughs) I'm in. Let's do it.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.275
(screaming)

09:33.073 --> 09:34.199
Liam's not here.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.243
His bed hasn't even
been slept in.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.745
If you've done something
to him, I swear to God...

09:38.786 --> 09:40.663
Didn't that priest
you ruined teach you

09:40.705 --> 09:41.915
it's not polite
to swear?

09:41.956 --> 09:43.333
This isn't funny.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.419
Okay, Liam's disappeared,
and I know you're behind it.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.462
I'm a lot of things,

09:47.504 --> 09:49.172
but a kidnapper,
a murderer?

09:49.214 --> 09:50.590
Get real.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.759
You pretended to be dead
just to extort him.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.469
I cannot imagine
what you're capable of.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.763
I just wanted him
to pay for what he did.

09:56.804 --> 09:57.931
He left me for dead.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.516
(scoffs)

09:59.558 --> 10:00.934
(sighs)

10:00.975 --> 10:03.228
Okay, who do you
keep calling?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.272
An off-duty cop
who's Liam's bodyguard.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.732
Damn it! She must have
turned her phone off.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.486
Liam has a bodyguard,
and it's a woman?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.238
(sighs)
How appropriate.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.740
The studio provided Ashley
for protection

10:15.782 --> 10:17.825
from conniving psycho skanks
like you.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.827
The studio?
Are you sure about that?

10:19.869 --> 10:22.997
Yes. Why?

10:24.916 --> 10:27.043
Frank, hey. It's Vanessa Shaw.

10:27.085 --> 10:30.380
Yeah, listen, do you guys have
any contact info handy

10:30.422 --> 10:32.466
on the officer
you assigned Liam?

10:35.093 --> 10:37.596
That's what I thought, thanks.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.474
Liam's contract didn't provide
for security.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.350
If the studio won't even
reimburse a mani-pedi,

10:42.392 --> 10:45.270
do you think they're gonna pay
for a bodyguard?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.521
Well, then, who sent her?

10:46.563 --> 10:49.316
I don't know, but I
do know one thing:

10:49.357 --> 10:52.527
Officer Ashley isn't
who she says she is.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.493
I want this stage to scream,

10:59.534 --> 11:01.828
"Dixon Wilson has
arrived," okay?

11:01.869 --> 11:02.954
Perfect.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.372
Hi.
Hey, hey.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.582
You're about six hours early

11:05.624 --> 11:07.083
to the world premiere
of Unfaithful Records.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.043
Right, well, actually
I got to ask a favor.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.545
Do you have
a minute?
Yeah, sure.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.507
Cool, I can't exactly talk
to Liam or Navid about this,

11:13.548 --> 11:16.801
and Ade and Naomi already left
on some last-minute road trip.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.512
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.139
Um, Adrianna,
the only artist on my label,

11:21.181 --> 11:23.517
who is also performing
tonight, went on a vacation?

11:24.309 --> 11:25.644
Yeah, that's typical.

11:25.684 --> 11:26.894
All-drama Adrianna is back.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.062
What about you, man?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.314
She said you're sleeping
around with some girl

11:29.356 --> 11:30.482
just to get back at
her for hurting you.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.483
Megan?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.776
No, Ade totally misread that.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.280
And I bet Megan did, too.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.616
I thought she was acting weird
because Ade busted in on us,

11:39.658 --> 11:42.410
a-and it's probably 'cause
she thinks I was using her, too.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.870
I-I got to put out this fire.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.705
Wait, first, um,
why I came here.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.875
Okay, so you know
how Teddy offered...

11:48.916 --> 11:50.293
Don't, don't say "sperm."

11:50.335 --> 11:51.919
...to father
my, my child.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.713
Okay.
Well, now he wants
to fight for custody.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.841
Will you be
a character witness for me?

11:56.883 --> 12:00.136
Silver, I-I-I don't
want to choose sides.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.180
Yeah, but, I mean,
Teddy is about to ruin

12:02.222 --> 12:05.392
my chance at having this baby.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.144
If you don't have this child,
are you sure it's a bad thing?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.770
Look, I-I'm
just saying,

12:09.812 --> 12:13.233
I-I don't think you're ready
to be a mother right now.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.028
Wow.

12:17.987 --> 12:18.946
Silver, Silver,

12:18.988 --> 12:21.824
look, look, I
care about you

12:21.866 --> 12:23.159
and I know you've been
going through a lot,

12:23.201 --> 12:25.579
which is why I haven't
really said anything.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.788
You shouldn't have a baby
just because you think

12:27.830 --> 12:29.374
you're gonna be missing
out on something.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.791
Oh, well, you just
don't understand.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.126
I do understand.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.212
My birth mom wasn't
ready to have a child.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.839
Look, Silver,
you're young,

12:36.881 --> 12:38.341
you really don't have a job,

12:38.383 --> 12:39.342
and your family is...

12:39.384 --> 12:41.010
I have my friends.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.971
At least I thought I did.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.348
Silver.

12:46.807 --> 12:50.019
(both laughing and sighing)

12:50.061 --> 12:53.314
I feel like I just washed
away all my troubles.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.857
Skinny-dipping is
so much more fun

12:54.899 --> 12:56.775
when nobody is chasing you
around with a rake.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.403
(laughs)

12:58.445 --> 12:59.778
Where are our clothes?

12:59.820 --> 13:01.656
They were right here.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.116
Did somebody steal them?

13:03.157 --> 13:04.492
No.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.993
No, no, no, no,

13:06.035 --> 13:07.120
no, no, no, no.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.497
Okay, um, stay calm,
let's think.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.582
There is a truck stop,

13:10.624 --> 13:11.958
like, half a mile
back down the road.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.627
We could be decked out
in NASCAR apparel

13:13.668 --> 13:14.877
before we know it.
No, Ade,

13:14.919 --> 13:17.255
my wedding ring was
in the pants pocket.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.673
What, why'd you take it off?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.174
I wasn't gonna wear
my ring in a mud pit

13:20.216 --> 13:21.718
in the middle of nowhere.
MAN:
If you're looking

13:21.760 --> 13:22.719
for something,
we saw some bikers

13:22.761 --> 13:24.429
snooping around
your car earlier.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.600
Bikers, like hairy rednecks
on motorcycles?

13:28.642 --> 13:29.892
Right on.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.771
Those Clydes hang out at a bar
about a mile up the road.

13:32.811 --> 13:33.896
Great, thank you.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.856
Come on, Ade, we're gonna
go get my ring back.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.067
Naomi, what
about clothes?

13:39.068 --> 13:41.112
Uh...

13:44.865 --> 13:46.951
(grunting)

14:04.552 --> 14:07.639
(doorknob jiggling)

14:15.021 --> 14:17.064
(grunting)

14:25.782 --> 14:28.785
(door unlocking)

14:31.287 --> 14:33.247
I got a surprise for you.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.583
(both grunting)

14:37.460 --> 14:39.504
(Liam screaming)

14:43.424 --> 14:46.010
(panting)

14:53.934 --> 14:56.646
(sighing)

15:01.150 --> 15:05.112
You know, you can't
keep me here forever.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.281
I'll press charges,
you'll never be a cop again.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.658
It's too late.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.161
The force suspended me months
ago for "erratic behavior."

15:12.203 --> 15:14.080
It's like nobody
will let me do my job.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.874
What?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.501
If you weren't assigned to me,
then w-why are you doing this?

15:18.543 --> 15:21.379
You needed me, Liam.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.715
I'd rather die than let
anything happen to you.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.966
You can't protect me
by keeping me here.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.468
I know.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.429
That's why I need to take you
somewhere safe.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.847
How, huh?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.515
I can't buy a cup of coffee

15:32.557 --> 15:35.059
without a stampede of paparazzi
following me,

15:35.101 --> 15:37.896
and I'm not going
anywhere with you.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.898
That's why

15:39.980 --> 15:41.148
you'll be traveling

15:41.190 --> 15:43.860
in this.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.031
You're gonna put me in a box?

15:49.073 --> 15:52.201
Just long enough to ship you
to Southern Mexico.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.370
Don't worry, I'll make it
very comfortable.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.747
Plenty of water
and food.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.831
You're insane.

15:56.873 --> 15:57.791
(scoffs)

15:57.832 --> 15:59.584
I'm not insane.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.753
I'm doing this for you,

16:01.795 --> 16:04.505
and if you won't get
in that box willingly,

16:04.547 --> 16:07.717
I have my stun gun
and plenty of sedatives.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.061
Hey.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.648
Oh, oh, good God.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.650
He thinks we're Ivy.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.903
No, no, this is not
our usual couture ever.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.655
Okay, um...

16:28.696 --> 16:31.741
(grunting)

16:35.077 --> 16:38.414
We were wondering,
have you seen a woman--

16:38.456 --> 16:39.999
or a man; I don't
really judge--

16:40.040 --> 16:41.208
wandering around
these parts,

16:41.250 --> 16:43.336
wearing a pair of fuchsia-
colored designer pants?

16:43.377 --> 16:44.378
They belong to me.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.172
You're in the wrong place,
sweetheart.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.215
No, n-no, uh, some bikers
stole our clothes,

16:48.257 --> 16:51.093
and we were told that this
is their stomping ground.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.804
Will be by later on
this afternoon.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.430
Pretty much every biker
within a hundred miles

16:54.472 --> 16:55.682
comes here for happy hour.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.183
Thank you.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.643
Okay, let's get cozy.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.020

20:06.873 --> 20:08.124
Whoo.
Very nice.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.126
(laughs)
Very nice.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.711
Would you like
to see my hog?

20:11.752 --> 20:12.753
Your what?

20:12.795 --> 20:14.547
It's another word
for motorcycle.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.882
Oh.
Come on.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.466
(laughing):
Oh, okay.

20:17.508 --> 20:21.220
Um, actually,
hold that thought, okay?

20:25.432 --> 20:27.393
Hey, any luck?

20:27.434 --> 20:28.769
No, not yet.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.147
Okay, I know
it's your wedding ring,

20:31.189 --> 20:33.191
but you could totally
just go buy a new one

20:33.232 --> 20:34.441
and Max wouldn't
even know.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.609
I'll always know.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.195
Hey, cheer up,
okay?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.654
You and Max have
a perfect marriage.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.406
It's bigger than some ring.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.450
Hi.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.494
You ready?

20:45.536 --> 20:48.748
Billy was going to go show
me his new motorcycle.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.249
Go.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.043
Really?
I would.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.545
I'll be out there.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.548
(sighs)

21:05.139 --> 21:06.807
Excuse me!

21:06.849 --> 21:08.142
Those are my pants.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.019
Your name's
Diane von Furstenberg?

21:10.061 --> 21:11.771
Nice try, Twiggy.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.147
Empty your pockets.
What?

21:13.189 --> 21:14.815
Empty your pockets.

21:14.857 --> 21:15.816
Whoa.

21:15.858 --> 21:16.859
Oh, my God.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.485
Where is it?
Where's my ring?

21:18.527 --> 21:19.570
What ring?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.030
I bought these pants
for ten bucks

21:21.072 --> 21:22.823
from a guy who said
he needed gas money,

21:22.865 --> 21:24.408
and he's probably
to Oregon by now.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.577
And wh-why exactly
should I believe a...

21:26.619 --> 21:29.496
roughneck, road-warrior
she-male like you?

21:29.538 --> 21:33.417
Because actually I'm
a pediatrician from Pasadena.

21:34.001 --> 21:34.961
And...

21:35.002 --> 21:36.254
this is just my weekend thing.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.797
Look,

21:37.838 --> 21:39.423
I will give you
your pants back, but...

21:39.465 --> 21:41.508
I don't know anything
about a ring, I swear.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.676
I'm sorry.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.844
(sighs)

21:43.886 --> 21:45.221
Me, too.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.147
Well, I guess the, uh...

21:54.188 --> 21:56.899
good news is he's not all gay.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.069
No, Teddy is still gay.

22:00.111 --> 22:03.572
We're not having a baby
together like that.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.909
Look, I'm sorry that I'm
coming to you with this.

22:06.951 --> 22:10.037
I know that you guys
are speaking again, and...

22:10.079 --> 22:11.998
family is so important to Teddy.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.582
It is. To all of us.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.919
The Montgomery family can take
care of... situations like this.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.672
How much do you want?

22:19.713 --> 22:21.381
What? Like, money?

22:21.423 --> 22:22.633
You're pregnant,
Teddy's the father.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.218
We'll honor the
financial liability.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.012
That's not what I want.
And I'm not even...

22:26.053 --> 22:27.221
I'm not even pregnant yet.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.308
(sighing):
Okay. So...

22:30.348 --> 22:32.226
Teddy donated sperm,
but now

22:32.268 --> 22:34.854
he and Shane want to co-raise
the child with me.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.272
But that is not
what I want.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.857
I don't want
a complicated situation.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.692
I don't want
shared custody.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.359
I just wanted a donor.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.071
I see.
(sighs)

22:44.113 --> 22:45.531
He respects you,

22:45.572 --> 22:47.950
and he cares
about what you think.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.619
I need you to convince Teddy

22:50.661 --> 22:53.497
that I should raise
this child alone.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.833
You just leave it up to me.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.669
(sighing):
Okay.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.587
This is your clutch
right here, all right?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.673
You just want to grip that
nice and tight.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.757
Like this?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.176
Just like that.
Okay.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.220
Perfect. I'm gonna
take this hand...

23:07.261 --> 23:10.348
I'm gonna put it over
the handle, just like this.

23:10.388 --> 23:11.557
All right?
(giggles)

23:11.598 --> 23:13.433
And then all you got
to do is just touch

23:13.475 --> 23:14.727
that little start button.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.188
Okay.
And get ready.

23:17.230 --> 23:20.191
(engine roars)
Oh!

23:20.233 --> 23:22.400
I did it!
Hell, yes, you did.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.695
(phone ringing)
Nice job.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.905
(engine stops)

23:25.946 --> 23:28.615
(chuckles)
You're a popular girl.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.658
(groans)

23:29.700 --> 23:31.327
(phone chimes)
It's my boss. Again.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.579
He won't stop
bugging me.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.623
Actually, you know what?

23:36.665 --> 23:39.459
I'm supposed to go to this
record label party tonight.

23:39.501 --> 23:42.922
How do you feel about giving
me a ride back to L.A.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.131
and being my date?

23:44.173 --> 23:45.465
Damn straight.

23:45.507 --> 23:46.717
(chuckles)

23:46.759 --> 23:48.928
Let's do it.
Good.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.974
Tequila. Straight up.
No chaser.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.853
You're too damn pretty
to be so sad.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.146
Name's Bear.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.731
Bottoms up, Bear.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.234
I can cheer you up.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.735
Got a motel room nearby.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.362
I'm a real good listener.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.155
I am...
(chuckles)

24:08.197 --> 24:11.491
flattered, really,
but I am a married woman.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.785
You sure? There's, uh...

24:12.826 --> 24:14.245
no ring on that finger.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.999
A ring is just a ring;
it's not the marriage.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.168
(chuckling):
Yeah. So where's the hubster?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.963
He's away on business,
and he will be back.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.256
Eventually.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.174
Sounds like your marriage
is TNT, darling,

24:27.216 --> 24:28.634
and the fuse is lit.

24:28.675 --> 24:29.885
Hey.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.388
Bear knows a thing or two
about shaky marriages.

24:32.430 --> 24:33.847
I remember my mom doing exactly

24:33.889 --> 24:35.682
what you're doing
when Daddy left.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.893
Drowning her sorrows,

24:37.935 --> 24:40.271
hanging with sleazebags,

24:40.313 --> 24:42.773
telling herself
everything was A-OK.

24:42.815 --> 24:46.026
You know, I was never
very close to my mom after that.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.987
I know what you mean.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.655
So what do you say...

24:49.696 --> 24:52.241
your place or mine?

24:52.283 --> 24:55.493
I say there's somewhere else
I have to be.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.537
(boxes shuffling)

25:03.294 --> 25:06.713
Whoops. That's what happens
when you deface my face.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.299
Can you keep it down?
What,

25:08.341 --> 25:10.384
says the girl who busted
in here like a honey badger?

25:13.553 --> 25:14.805
Did you find something?
Yeah,

25:14.847 --> 25:17.350
Ashley bought a ton
of high-tech equipment.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.185
Lots of cameras.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.978
Surveillance.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.689
I'm familiar.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.400
All this equipment was delivered
to an address at the Pier.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.277
The Offshore?
No.

25:28.319 --> 25:29.903
This address
is under the Offshore,

25:29.945 --> 25:32.698
and that shop's been empty
for almost a year.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.616
I think we found Liam.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.877
Hi, Mom.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.258
TRACY:
When I heard you

26:32.299 --> 26:35.469
got married, I nearly
fell out of my chair.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.471
Uh, did you get my gift?

26:37.513 --> 26:40.057
Yeah. I meant to call...
Oh!

26:40.099 --> 26:41.559
It's okay.

26:41.599 --> 26:42.851
I know you're busy.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.020
And the newspaper
announcement,

26:45.062 --> 26:46.730
I put it on
my fridge.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.442
You looked like you were
really happy.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.194
Even... smiling
in your mug shot.

26:52.236 --> 26:55.781
Just 'cause I was smiling
doesn't mean I was happy.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.743
It's something we do
to cover the pain, right, Mom?

26:59.785 --> 27:01.120
I don't know what you mean.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.122
I was so angry
when you and Dad got divorced.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.373
That's why I never reached out.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.084
I mean, obviously,
I had to

27:07.126 --> 27:10.254
blame Dad because he was
a man-whore, but...

27:10.296 --> 27:12.298
if I'm really honest,

27:12.339 --> 27:15.468
I mostly blamed you...

27:15.509 --> 27:18.304
...for ignoring all of
the problems in your marriage,

27:18.345 --> 27:21.140
and now I...

27:21.181 --> 27:23.434
am ignoring all
of the problems in my marriage

27:23.476 --> 27:26.395
and I don't know why
because I swore to God I would

27:26.437 --> 27:29.064
never make the same mistakes
that you did.

27:34.445 --> 27:37.948
Why do we do this, Mom?

27:37.990 --> 27:40.618
What's wrong with us?

27:40.658 --> 27:42.119
Deep down,

27:42.161 --> 27:45.872
I think I always knew that your
dad wasn't the right guy for me.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.335
So I didn't fight for him

27:49.376 --> 27:51.420
when I found out
he was cheating

27:51.462 --> 27:52.963
or even when he left.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.383
But you always pretended like
everything was so perfect. Why?

27:56.425 --> 27:59.345
Well, I told myself that I was
doing that for you girls.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.804
Oh. Right.

28:00.846 --> 28:05.976
Look, what I know is that I have
spent years being miserable.

28:07.645 --> 28:10.814
And you're... smarter
than me, Naomi.

28:10.856 --> 28:11.607
(scoffs)

28:11.649 --> 28:12.608
You're here.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.193
You are fighting
for your marriage.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.736
Yeah.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.198
But what if it's too late?

28:19.239 --> 28:20.866
(sighs)

28:20.907 --> 28:22.993
Max is gone.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.121
My wedding ring's gone.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.461
God, Mom, how can I hold on
to a marriage

28:32.503 --> 28:34.880
if I can't even hold on
to a ring?

28:34.921 --> 28:37.007
Wh...

28:38.634 --> 28:40.678
(sighs)

28:47.601 --> 28:48.686
(sniffling)

28:48.727 --> 28:50.896
(sighs)

28:52.981 --> 28:54.316
I planned to give it to you,

28:54.358 --> 28:58.654
assuming that you ever
talked to me again.

28:58.696 --> 29:01.240
Don't tell your sister.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.325
(chuckles)

29:04.493 --> 29:07.037
It's beautiful, Mom.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.373
It was your grandmother's.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.418
She was happily married
for 60 years.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.960
(chuckles)

29:14.002 --> 29:17.797
So, yes, denial is a major trait
in our family,

29:17.839 --> 29:20.593
(laughs)
but...

29:20.634 --> 29:23.554
Clark women can find happiness.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.473
You need to decide,

29:26.515 --> 29:29.476
is Max the man
you're gonna fight for...

29:29.518 --> 29:31.228
or let go of?

29:36.400 --> 29:38.193

Wouldn't miss it, buddy.
Congratulations.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.736
Thank you, thank
you. It, uh...

30:20.778 --> 30:22.696
it means a lot,
you being here.

30:22.738 --> 30:23.781
It really does.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.741
You know, everybody
else is M.I.A.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.951
I actually called a
few producer friends

30:27.993 --> 30:31.580
and pulled some strings and
we got Rita Ora to perform.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.541
Mm. When's Ade go on?

30:34.583 --> 30:36.918
Ade's AWOL, dude.
(sighs)

30:36.960 --> 30:38.587
She's trying to ruin
my label launch party

30:38.629 --> 30:40.714
like she ruined things
with this new girl, Megan,

30:40.756 --> 30:43.925
who now thinks that I'm
still hung up on Ade.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.260
Isn't that crazy?

30:45.302 --> 30:47.887
Not really. I mean, you and Ade
just broke up, you know?

30:47.929 --> 30:50.223
There's bound to be
unresolved feelings.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.891
No, no. There's
nothing unresolved

30:51.933 --> 30:53.560
about the way that
I feel right now.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.688
After what she did
with Taylor? (scoffs)

30:55.729 --> 30:57.897
Look, if I think
about it too much,

30:57.939 --> 30:59.566
I'm actually
sure I hate her.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.360
Dixon, hate is
a strong feeling, man.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.779
You got to learn
to let go of that anger.

31:03.821 --> 31:04.988
You'll never move on.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.034
Come on, man, it's your party.

31:09.075 --> 31:12.245
MAN:
Ade, look over here!
Who's the new guy, Ade?

31:12.287 --> 31:13.455
Ade, over here!

Ashley has installed security
cameras all over the Offshore.

31:50.784 --> 31:51.869
She's gonna see us coming.

31:51.910 --> 31:52.828
I'm counting on it.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.747
Since she views me as
her biggest threat,

31:54.788 --> 31:56.081
I'll lure her
away from Liam.

31:56.122 --> 31:58.166
You'll call 911 while
she's busy with me.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.502
Vanessa, Ashley is
obviously dangerous,

32:00.544 --> 32:02.045
not to mention you're
wanted by the cops.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.630
They'll arrested you
as soon as they get here.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.132
After everything I did to Liam,

32:06.174 --> 32:08.051
I owe him this much.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.179
I know it might be
hard to believe,

32:11.221 --> 32:13.056
but I really did love him.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.934
Well, be careful, okay?

32:15.975 --> 32:18.562
Okay.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.564
Let's get this bitch.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.278
(metallic stapling)

32:27.654 --> 32:30.657
Okay, soundproofing
is complete.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.992
Now, just food and water
and you're good to go.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.245
You really don't have
to do this.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.747
I wish there was
another way, Liam,

32:36.789 --> 32:38.540
but you've left me
no choice.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.170
No, I-I mean...

32:44.212 --> 32:45.798
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

32:45.839 --> 32:50.844
I'll go wherever
you think I should go.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.807
You were right.

32:54.848 --> 32:57.643
Vanessa's been
screwing me over.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.815
I mean, I should
be thanking you

33:02.856 --> 33:05.525
for all that you're
doing for me.

33:05.567 --> 33:08.445
I don't know why I
keep fighting it.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.489
I'm so stupid!

33:10.530 --> 33:13.826
You're not stupid, Liam.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.121
You're perfect.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.665
No, I am stupid.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.876
I don't know why I keep falling
for all the wrong kinda girls,

33:22.918 --> 33:25.963
and that's especially
stupid when...

33:26.004 --> 33:30.676
the right girl is probably
right underneath my nose.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.303
Who?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.514
Someone like you.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.392
You're smart

33:39.434 --> 33:41.603
and you're beautiful.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.524
I don't know why I can't
fall for a girl like you.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.152
Maybe you can.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.323
Yeah.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.379
VANESSA:
Liam!

34:07.420 --> 34:09.882
Liam, we need to talk!

34:09.922 --> 34:11.591
Damn it.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.427
I know we can work this out.

34:14.469 --> 34:15.554
Don't worry, Liam.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.556
I'm never going to let Vanessa
bother you again.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.099
Come see me.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.393

that torturing you is just
another way of hating you,

35:32.047 --> 35:34.132
and I don't want
to hate you, Ade.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.842
I don't.

Hey.
Silver,

36:17.676 --> 36:18.551
and Uncle Charles.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.428
What are you guys
doing here?

36:20.470 --> 36:22.014
Hopefully, uh, saving you
from making a huge mistake.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.141
Come on. Let's, uh,
talk over here.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.811
Teddy, I know this is
all about family for you...

36:27.853 --> 36:29.855
Obviously, that's what
having a baby is all about.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.230
Your friend here
wants to have a family,

36:31.272 --> 36:32.524
and you offered to help,

36:32.565 --> 36:34.693
but you didn't think about
the family you already have.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.653
Actually, I did.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.904
I thought a lot
about our family

36:37.946 --> 36:39.156
and how I didn't want
to make the same mistake.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.574
So now you thought
you'd make a new one?

36:41.616 --> 36:44.036
Son, you can't keep
doing things like this.

36:44.077 --> 36:46.788
A nationally-telecast
gay wedding is one thing,

36:46.830 --> 36:48.581
but now you want to have a child
with an unwed mother

36:48.623 --> 36:49.708
and your friend?

36:49.749 --> 36:51.877
He has a name. It's Shane,
and we're in a relationship.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.252
Why can't you just accept that?

36:53.294 --> 36:55.797
Actually, this isn't about Teddy
and Shane's relationship.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.799
This is about sticking
to what we agreed on.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.217
This is about me
not walking away

36:59.258 --> 37:01.469
from the people who are
important to me.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.096
I'm committed to Shane
and having a family.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.222
Oh, a family. Yeah.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.932
You two boys will
never be a real family,

37:05.974 --> 37:08.101
and you're definitely
not fit to raise a child.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.435
Hey, not what we came here
to discuss.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.396
You know what? I'm not
listening to this anymore.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.856
I can't believe
you'd do this to me

37:12.898 --> 37:14.774
just to keep me from getting
custody of my own child.

37:14.816 --> 37:15.984
Both of you keep
talking about this

37:16.026 --> 37:17.194
like it's a custody battle.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.987
Embryos are legally
considered property,

37:19.029 --> 37:20.822
and since you
can't see reason,

37:20.864 --> 37:22.365
I'm prepared to file
a motion in court

37:22.407 --> 37:23.700
demanding Family Rights...

37:25.368 --> 37:26.870
...to keep the embryos
frozen indefinitely

37:26.912 --> 37:28.329
or to have them destroyed.

37:28.371 --> 37:29.789
That's... What?

37:29.831 --> 37:31.249
You can't do that.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.418
You just watch me.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.423
Ted...

37:50.185 --> 37:51.937
Looking for me?!

37:51.978 --> 37:53.730
(crashing, grunting)

37:55.314 --> 37:57.275
Annie?

37:57.316 --> 37:59.485
We're getting you
the hell out of here.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.780
I knew you couldn't
stay away from him.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.865
Give me one reason
why I should?

38:07.577 --> 38:09.370
Oh, thank God.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.958
All right, let's go.
The cops are on their way.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.251
Oh, my God.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.461
I don't know how much time
Vanessa can buy us. Come on.

38:16.502 --> 38:17.754
Wait, wait.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.214
I can't just leave her here.

38:19.256 --> 38:21.800

38:29.182 --> 38:30.558
SILVER:
Teddy!

38:30.600 --> 38:31.977
Teddy, I didn't mean
for that to happen.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.228
What the hell did you mean, huh?

38:33.270 --> 38:35.272
Was it to ruin our friendship,
'cause congratulations,

38:35.313 --> 38:36.522
we're not friends anymore.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.732
Please wait. Wait.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.234
Let me fix this, okay?
I can fix this.

38:39.276 --> 38:42.821
We're way past fixing, Silver!

38:42.862 --> 38:44.781
I'm never signing that form,

38:44.823 --> 38:47.617
and you're never having my baby.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.543
(grunting)

38:57.585 --> 38:58.711
(glass breaking)

39:00.505 --> 39:02.674
You're never hurting
Liam again.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.969
Stay back, Liam.
I have this under control.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.512

39:07.553 --> 39:09.306
Not anymore.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.683

39:12.558 --> 39:14.894
Come on. Breathe.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.316
I'm trying to help you.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.318
No. Vanessa's helping me.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.527
How can you still care about her

39:22.568 --> 39:25.030
after everything
she did to you?

39:25.071 --> 39:27.532
Because she cared enough
to come back for me.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.825
Liam, the police
are on their way.
