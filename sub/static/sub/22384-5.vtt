00:16.850 --> 00:17.994
[Hopper] Hey, you reached Jim.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.812
I'm probably doing something incredible
right now, and I can't...

01:13.073 --> 01:17.535
[Will] It's like... It's like I feel
what the shadow monster's feeling.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.497
See what he's seeing.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.373
Like in the Upside Down?

01:23.958 --> 01:25.251
Some of him is there.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.254
But some of him is here, too.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.510
- Here, like, in this house?
- In this house and...

01:35.345 --> 01:36.596
in me.

01:36.679 --> 01:41.518
It's like... It's like he's reaching
into Hawkins more and more.

01:42.143 --> 01:45.522
And the more he spreads,
the more connected to him I feel.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.690
And the more you see these now-memories.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.486
At first I just felt it
in the back of my head.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.155
I didn't even really know it was there.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.325
It's like when you have a dream

01:57.909 --> 02:00.870
and you can't remember it
unless you think really hard.

02:01.704 --> 02:02.914
It was like that.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.208
But know it's like...

02:06.334 --> 02:09.920
Now I remember. I remember all the time.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.675
Maybe...

02:14.384 --> 02:16.636
- Maybe that's good.
- Good?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.263
Just think about it, Will.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.349
You're like a spy now. A superspy.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.851
Spying on the shadow monster.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.855
If you know what he's seeing
and feeling...

02:27.939 --> 02:29.482
maybe that's how we can stop him.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.319
Maybe all of this
is happening for a reason.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.991
- You really think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.084
What if he figures out
we're spying on him?

02:49.127 --> 02:51.838
- [sniffles] What if he spies back?
- He won't.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.675
How do you know?

02:56.593 --> 02:57.677
We won't let him.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.811
[Hopper breathing heavily]

03:23.494 --> 03:24.494
Ugh!

[grunting and coughing]

04:35.149 --> 04:37.151
[theme music playing]

05:39.380 --> 05:42.550
- [man 1] Hey.
- [man 2] Hey. Did you get 'em?

05:42.633 --> 05:43.634
[man 1] Yeah.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.595
[both continue speaking indistinctly]

05:51.642 --> 05:53.644
[song playing on stereo]

06:11.412 --> 06:14.040
We'd like a... uh, a room.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.541
We got those.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.253
You want a single or a double?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.421
[both] Double.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.342
[slurping]

06:36.312 --> 06:37.312
Nance...

06:37.939 --> 06:40.691
- Uh, on or off?
- Hmm.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.403
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

06:45.988 --> 06:47.365
déjà vu.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.449
[chuckles softly]

06:49.951 --> 06:52.036
- Yeah.
- [both chuckle softly]

06:53.663 --> 06:54.997
Don't you think it's weird?

06:55.748 --> 06:56.748
What?

06:56.791 --> 06:59.585
How we only seem to hang out
when the world's about to end?

06:59.669 --> 07:00.920
It's not going to end.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.840
Feels like it. [sighs]

07:09.637 --> 07:10.805
Still have yours?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.517
- [Jonathan] Yeah.
- Mmm...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.644
- Yeah, mine's bigger.
- [chuckles]

07:17.311 --> 07:19.480
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.247
[sighs]

07:38.166 --> 07:39.250
What happened?

07:40.835 --> 07:41.878
What do you mean?

07:43.838 --> 07:44.839
To us?

07:48.092 --> 07:49.927
After everything, you just...

07:52.513 --> 07:53.848
disappeared.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.227
[sighs]

07:58.311 --> 08:00.354
Yeah, Will needed me.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.735
And Steve...

08:08.029 --> 08:09.405
I waited.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.074
Yeah, like, only a month.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.209
[Nancy] I want them off.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.151
[gasping]

08:48.569 --> 08:50.363
Will, what's wrong?

08:59.455 --> 09:00.665
[Will] Mom?

09:01.791 --> 09:02.792
Mom?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.461
- Mom?
- [gasps] Yeah?

09:07.004 --> 09:09.590
- I saw him.
- You saw who, baby?

09:09.674 --> 09:10.800
Hopper.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.553
I think he's in trouble.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.098
I think he's going to die.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.602

[song playing on stereo]

11:06.415 --> 11:09.752
- That's enough, Erica.
- Uh-uh.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.004
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

11:13.005 --> 11:16.467
When Mom's mad at you,
how do you make her not mad?

11:16.550 --> 11:19.929
Hmm. That's a great question.
How do you, hon?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.098
[Mr. Sinclair] First, I apologize.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.434
Then, I get your mother
whatever she wants.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.936
Even when she's wrong?

11:28.312 --> 11:29.730
She's never wrong, son.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.775
That's right. [chuckles]

11:35.319 --> 11:37.238
- Not hungry?
- [Lucas] Not really.

11:38.906 --> 11:39.949
Where you goin'?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.119
To hang out with Dustin.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.581
[softly] Sorry.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.764
[Claudia] Mews!

12:04.765 --> 12:05.808
Mewsy!

12:07.393 --> 12:08.853
Mews!

12:09.728 --> 12:11.439
Mewsy!

12:14.942 --> 12:17.778
Dusty, baby, you're sure
she's not in your room?

12:17.862 --> 12:19.113
- [sighs]
- Uh-huh.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.116
[automated voice]
If you'd like to make a call...

12:21.198 --> 12:23.743
Thank you so much,
Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.744
You are a true lifesaver.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.538
- All right, this was great.
- [dial tone]

12:27.621 --> 12:29.206
Thank you. All right. Have a good one.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.292
Bye-bye, now. All right. You, too.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.420
All right, great news.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.796
They found her?

12:35.880 --> 12:39.049
No. But they saw her wandering
around Loch Nora.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.303
[crying] How did the poor baby
get all the way out there?

12:42.386 --> 12:45.014
I don't know. Lost, I guess.
But they're gonna look for her.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.349
And I'll stay here,
just in case they call again.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.269
And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah?

12:50.352 --> 12:53.063
Give me hug.
Give me a hug. Go get her.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.398
- You're gonna find her.
- Okay.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.066
- We can find her.
- We can find her.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.776
I love you.

- I love you.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.863
- I love you.
- All right, go.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.490
All right.

13:35.731 --> 13:39.109
All right, Dart. Breakfast time.

13:44.573 --> 13:48.118
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Five-fifteen.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.800
All right, "Five-fifteen." Sure.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.178
Thank you.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.014
Hey.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.934
You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.560
Must be scared half to death.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.229
How long's it been?

Long time.

Look, I don't want your Thin Mints,
all right, kid?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.416
- Thin Mints?
- Or your religious mumbo jumbo.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.876
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, okay?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.975
[creaking]

17:01.478 --> 17:03.939
I want to see Mama.

17:06.233 --> 17:10.319

- Yeah! Five answers will beat it, Lynn.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.455
[Lynn] Visit with other employees.

this is the right place?

18:25.395 --> 18:28.565

[Murray] Look at the camera.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.134
- The camera.
- [Jonathan] What camera?

18:55.217 --> 18:59.179
[Murray] Not the loudspeaker.
Above you, to the right.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.683

Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers.
You two are a long way from home.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.870
Well...

19:24.163 --> 19:26.915
I hope you didn't come all this way
to tell me about the bear

19:26.999 --> 19:29.084
in the Harrington kid's backyard.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.587
I've heard that one already.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.268
Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.192
I followed up on 200 tips,

19:53.275 --> 19:56.570
most bogus, but that's how
these things always go, okay?

19:57.613 --> 20:00.115
I know every last step
Barbara took that day,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.075
every last person she talked to.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.078
The answer to what happened
to your friend, it's up here somewhere.

20:05.162 --> 20:09.041
I assure you that.
I just gotta connect the right dots.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.542
Timeline's wrong.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.586
I'm sorry?

20:13.795 --> 20:15.464
Your timeline is wrong.

20:16.423 --> 20:21.470
And the girl with the buzzed hair,
she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.263
Her name was Eleven.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.557

20:55.963 --> 20:56.964
What happened?

20:57.798 --> 21:00.592
Short circuit in the motherboard.
A real bummer.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.679
But fret not. I got another machine
up and running in the back.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.101
Hold these.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.283
You better get me that date now, Sinclair.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.034
- I told you I would.
- [grunts]

21:27.494 --> 21:29.496
And keep things PG in here, all right?

21:32.165 --> 21:33.583
[door closes]

21:33.667 --> 21:35.210
What is this shit, stalker?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.838
Sorry. I just needed a safe place.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.465
A safe place to what? Be creepy?

21:40.549 --> 21:43.802
Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth
about everything that happened last year.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.513
But if anyone finds out,
you could be arrested.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.641
[sighs] Possibly killed.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.352
- Killed?
- I need to know.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.397
Do you accept the risk?

21:55.480 --> 22:00.527
- Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid.
- Do you accept the risk?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.154
Yeah.

22:03.780 --> 22:04.781
Sure. Fine.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.700
I accept the risk.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.582
Let's hear it.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.168
Last year...

22:18.337 --> 22:20.422
Will didn't get lost in the woods.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.761
He got lost somewhere else.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.144
[thunder rumbling]

22:36.063 --> 22:39.316
Hey, is this where you saw him?
[stutters] Is this where you saw Hopper?

22:39.399 --> 22:41.234
I think so. Yeah.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.360
[softly] Okay.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.377
[Mike] Here!

23:06.510 --> 23:09.471
Okay, so... so Hopper is here?

23:09.554 --> 23:12.682
Yeah. Now we just need to find out
where here is, right?

23:12.766 --> 23:13.683
Right.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.394
Did he say anything?
I mean, before he left?

23:16.478 --> 23:19.648
[sighs] Uh, some... something about vines?

23:19.731 --> 23:22.150
- [car approaching]
- Hopper.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.914
Surprise. I would've called,
but you said not to clog up the line.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.959
You know, I... We're fine,
we don't need anything.

23:39.042 --> 23:42.921
When I was sick as a kid,
and I was sick all the time as a kid,

23:43.004 --> 23:46.174
nothing made me feel better
than focusing on these brain teasers.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.677
Those are great. Ah...

23:48.760 --> 23:49.960
I could teach him how to play.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.305
- You know, he's sleeping.
- [thunder rumbling]

23:53.014 --> 23:54.015
Okay.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.226
I could wait with you?

23:56.309 --> 23:59.146
[sighs] Listen, it's just not a good time.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.023
But, um, you know what?
I'll call you, okay?

24:02.649 --> 24:03.650
Thank you.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.735
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.738
Well, have him call me. They don't call me
Bob the Brain for nothing.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.031
[chuckles]

24:12.868 --> 24:14.452
[gasps] Bob!

24:15.996 --> 24:16.997
That's my name.

24:25.797 --> 24:26.797
Huh.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.551
Hmm.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.471
- You drew all these yourself?
- [Joyce] Mmm-hmm.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.768
- Why, exactly?
- I... I told you the rules.

24:38.852 --> 24:41.396
- No questions, okay?
- Yeah.

24:41.479 --> 24:44.482
We... we just need you
to help us figure out what...

24:45.066 --> 24:46.526
Bob? Bob?

24:47.527 --> 24:48.528
Over here.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.784
Where... where this is.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.953
That's the objective. Find the X.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.623
Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?
[chuckles]

24:59.706 --> 25:01.499
Bob, no questions.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.584
Okay.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.631
- [sighs and clicks tongue]
- [Joyce clears throat]

25:07.714 --> 25:09.633
Let me talk to you for a second.
Hang on, guys.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.221
Joyce, you can talk to me.
You know that, right?

25:14.304 --> 25:18.433
[stammers] Yeah.
What's the problem, exactly?

25:18.516 --> 25:19.643
What's the problem?

25:21.019 --> 25:23.897
Joyce, [sighs] Will doesn't look well.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.565
You don't look well.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.566
What's going on?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.360
Nothing. Nothing.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.443
Is this an episode?
Is this one of Will's episodes?

25:30.487 --> 25:32.614
No. No! No. [scoffs]

25:32.697 --> 25:35.575
[stutters] I'm sorry. I just... I don't...

25:35.659 --> 25:38.828
see how any of this is good for Will,
or for you.

25:38.912 --> 25:42.249
And even if I wanted to play along,
I mean, how could I figure anything out

25:42.332 --> 25:44.167
if I don't understand
the context of the game?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.502
[thunder rumbling]

25:45.585 --> 25:47.254
- Or...
- What?

25:47.337 --> 25:50.257
- What is it?
- I know that shape.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.384
It's Lovers' Lake.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.639
It's Lovers' Lake. I get it.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.975
Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan.

26:00.058 --> 26:03.853
And if that's Lake Jordan,
then you can probably find...

26:03.937 --> 26:06.773
Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.442
And if you just follow it naturally...

26:10.318 --> 26:11.361
it moves to...

26:12.320 --> 26:13.697
the Eno River.

26:13.780 --> 26:17.075
And there it is.
That's the Eno, do you see it?

26:17.158 --> 26:20.453
Okay, so the lines aren't roads.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.205
But they act like roads.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.916
And they act like roads 'cause when you
follow 'em, you'll see...

26:25.625 --> 26:26.751
they don't go over water.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.754
And that's the giveaway.
That's the giveaway. Ha!

26:29.838 --> 26:31.278
Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle,

26:31.965 --> 26:33.091
it's a map.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.011
It's a map of Hawkins.

26:36.928 --> 26:37.929
[Bob laughs]

26:40.307 --> 26:41.307
Right, Will?

26:46.313 --> 26:47.731
[squealing]

26:47.814 --> 26:48.982
[radio static]

26:49.065 --> 26:50.317
[Hopper] Does anybody copy?

26:51.151 --> 26:54.779
Look, if anybody copies,
this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...

26:54.863 --> 26:56.865
[radio static]

26:57.782 --> 26:59.367
[panting]

27:15.842 --> 27:16.843
[Hopper gasps]

27:20.597 --> 27:22.599
[breathing heavily]

27:29.272 --> 27:30.273
[screeching]

27:43.953 --> 27:45.080
[grunts]

27:50.251 --> 27:52.253
[screeching]

27:55.298 --> 27:57.300
[grunting]

28:01.388 --> 28:03.390
[continues grunting]

28:13.149 --> 28:16.027
Guys, this is Dustin again.

28:16.111 --> 28:20.407
Does anyone copy? This is a code red.
I repeat, a code red!

28:20.490 --> 28:23.910
I really need someone to pick up here.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.289
Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.250
Code red!

28:30.333 --> 28:32.293
All right, it's Dustin again.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.795
Seriously, I have a code red.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.172
Could you please shut up?

28:36.256 --> 28:38.007
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there?

28:38.091 --> 28:41.136
- Where is he?
- Don’t know. Don't care.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.303
[stutters] Is he with Mike?

28:42.387 --> 28:45.974
Like I said,
I don't know and I don't care.

28:46.057 --> 28:49.853
Please tell him it's super important.
Please tell him that I have a code...

28:49.936 --> 28:51.020
Code red?

28:51.104 --> 28:53.314
- Yep, code red. Exactly.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.567
I got a code for you instead.

28:55.650 --> 28:58.903
It's called code shut-your-mouth.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.656
[radio static]

29:01.740 --> 29:02.741
[stutters] Erica?

29:05.160 --> 29:08.163
[Becky] I just need a little help
understanding, sweetie, okay?

29:09.456 --> 29:13.543
Can you tell me where you came from?

29:14.377 --> 29:17.213
- Where you've been all this time?
- [TV playing indistinctly]

29:20.717 --> 29:24.095
A policeman and a woman
came looking for you last year.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.556
Did they find you?

29:26.639 --> 29:28.183
She won't get better...

29:30.059 --> 29:31.478
will she?

29:33.688 --> 29:35.148
They don't think so, no.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.277
[sniffles] But she's not in any pain.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.822
She's just stuck, they think.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.033
Like in a dream.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.494
A long dream.

29:48.912 --> 29:49.996
A good dream?

29:51.164 --> 29:52.624
I hope so.

29:52.707 --> 29:53.792
[Eleven sighs]

29:56.294 --> 29:57.629
Is it the same dream?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.632
[Becky] We don't know.

30:00.715 --> 30:03.134
Sometimes she says different words.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.719
But usually those.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.139
[cries softly]

30:11.559 --> 30:13.645
She always believed
that you were out there.

30:14.854 --> 30:17.690
She always believed
that you'd come home one day.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.653
Home?

30:21.736 --> 30:23.071
Yeah, home.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.116
[Eleven sniffles]

30:28.326 --> 30:30.328
[door creaking]

31:06.239 --> 31:07.239
Pretty.

31:07.782 --> 31:12.203
I can get you a real bed,
and you can stay here with me

31:12.287 --> 31:13.288
if you want.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.081
How's that sound?

31:21.337 --> 31:26.342
I wanna help you, but to really do that,
I need you to talk to me, okay?

31:26.968 --> 31:29.596
Doesn't have to be now.
Doesn't have to be today.

31:30.763 --> 31:31.931
But when you're ready.

31:32.849 --> 31:33.849
Okay?

31:37.979 --> 31:38.979
Okay.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.238
[Becky] Oh, yeah, that.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.116
That happens sometimes.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.368
Old house, bad wiring...

31:53.786 --> 31:56.831
Or if you ask
my crazy aunt Shirley, it's...

31:58.833 --> 31:59.833
haunted.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.769
Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring.

32:17.852 --> 32:18.853
No.

32:29.572 --> 32:31.574
[muttering indistinctly]

32:35.078 --> 32:36.162
It's Mama.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.958
Sunflower. Rainbow.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.544
Three to the right. Four to the left.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.546
[stutters] I don't understand.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.674
Four-fifty.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.842
She knows I'm here.

32:50.677 --> 32:53.221
[TV channels changing]

33:04.941 --> 33:06.401
She wants to talk.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.361
Rainbow.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.698
- [static hissing]
- [Terry speaking indistinctly]

33:14.158 --> 33:15.326
[Bob] All right.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.082
All right. I'm 3.6 inches,
what do you got?

33:21.165 --> 33:23.042
I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?

33:23.126 --> 33:24.252
Hold on.

33:29.841 --> 33:34.262
- Twenty-one feet, four inches.
- What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?

33:34.345 --> 33:37.098
[sighs and stammers] Danford?
Where's Danford?

33:37.181 --> 33:38.181
Dining room.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.229
[sighs] Sixteen feet, ten inches.

33:43.312 --> 33:44.605
What about Danford to Jordan?

33:44.689 --> 33:47.442
Oh, come on.
[stuttering] This has gotta be enough.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.068
It's not. It's... it's really not.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.404
Okay. Can't you figure it out?

33:51.487 --> 33:54.115
[stuttering] Well, it's hard.
The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one.

33:54.198 --> 33:57.201
I mean, if you're twisting my arm,
and you are twisting my arm,

33:57.285 --> 34:00.163
I would say that the X is...

34:02.498 --> 34:05.626
maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?

34:05.710 --> 34:08.129
[sighs] Thank you. Thank you.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.010
What? Are we... we really going?

34:20.391 --> 34:21.516
[Karen] I don't know, Cath.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.103
Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher,
that'd be another story.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.855
[doorbell ringing]

34:26.563 --> 34:27.690
Just a second, Cath.

34:29.108 --> 34:31.069
Ted, can you get that please?

34:33.029 --> 34:34.029
Sorry.

34:35.531 --> 34:36.531
I got it.

34:38.659 --> 34:43.121
Your line has been busy
for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.333
- Do you realize this?
- Oh, I do realize.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.126
- Is Mike home?
- No.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.420
No? Well, where the hell is he?

34:49.504 --> 34:51.464
Karen, where's our son?

34:51.547 --> 34:52.715
Will's!

34:52.799 --> 34:55.051
- Will's.
- [sighs] No one's picking up there.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.803
Nancy. What about Nancy?

34:56.886 --> 34:58.805
Karen, where's Nancy?

34:58.888 --> 35:00.765
- [sighs] Ally's!
- Ally's.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.310
Our children don't live here anymore.
You didn't know that?

35:04.393 --> 35:06.771
- Seriously?
- Am I done here?

35:06.854 --> 35:09.732
Son of a bitch. You're really no help
at all, you know that?

35:09.816 --> 35:11.567
[Ted] Hey! Language.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.457
Listen...

35:28.000 --> 35:29.001
I've been thinking...

35:29.585 --> 35:31.003
I love you. I'm sorry.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.005
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?

35:33.089 --> 35:34.090
Steve.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.300
Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?

35:37.009 --> 35:37.885
- No.
- Good.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.179
- Hey. What the hell? Hey!
- Nancy isn't home.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.806
- Where is she?
- Doesn't matter.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.850
We have bigger problems
than your love life.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.017
Do you still have that bat?

35:45.101 --> 35:47.353
- Bat? What bat?
- The one with the nails?

35:47.436 --> 35:49.480
- Why?
- I'll explain it on the way.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.400
- Now?
- Now!

35:52.483 --> 35:54.485
[grunting]

36:05.329 --> 36:07.331
[panting]

36:17.049 --> 36:19.051
[groaning]

36:24.015 --> 36:26.017
[coughing]

36:28.352 --> 36:30.354
[breathing heavily]

36:40.781 --> 36:41.782
[groans]

36:44.952 --> 36:45.953
Son of a bitch!

36:47.246 --> 36:48.289
[grunting]

36:52.210 --> 36:53.544
[yelling]

36:56.672 --> 37:00.092
Wait. Wait. No, no! No! No!

37:01.177 --> 37:02.220
[grunting]

37:03.930 --> 37:04.931
[yelling]

37:13.898 --> 37:16.525
[muffled screaming]

37:20.988 --> 37:22.990
[Lucas] And that was the last
we ever saw of her.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.035
After that, she was just gone.

37:26.118 --> 37:29.914
I can't believe it's been that long.
Feels like yesterday.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.833
Yeah. I mean, I bet.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.294
- Wow.
- It's crazy.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.129
[sighs] I know.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.714
It's crazy, but...

37:40.841 --> 37:41.926
I really liked it.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.637
- Liked it?
- Yeah.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.556
- Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
- Issues?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.350
I felt it was a little derivative
in parts.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.685
What are you talking about?

37:50.768 --> 37:52.687
I just wish it had
a little more originality.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.313
- That's all.
- You don't believe me?

37:54.397 --> 37:58.567
Lucas, come on, seriously?
How gullible do you think I am?

37:58.651 --> 37:59.819
Why would I make this up?

37:59.902 --> 38:05.574
I don't know. To impress me or something?
Or you're just, like, insane.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.744
I tell you all of this.
I mean, top-secret stuff.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.372
Risking my life.
And this is how you react?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.040
[chuckles] Risking your life?

38:13.124 --> 38:15.918
- Oh, so this is funny to you?
- Yeah. I mean...

38:16.919 --> 38:17.919
kind of funny.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.299
Stupid, but funny.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.384
Where are you going?

38:24.468 --> 38:26.429
Story time's over, isn't it?

38:28.764 --> 38:30.766
[indistinct chatter]

38:30.850 --> 38:33.394
What's wrong with you?
I gave you what you wanted.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.896
I wanted to be a part of the group,
not a part of some joke.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.189
It's not a joke.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.983
You did a good job, okay?

38:39.066 --> 38:40.906
You can go tell the others
I believed your lies

38:40.985 --> 38:42.862
if it gets you experience points
or whatever.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.405
[sighs]

38:45.156 --> 38:47.158
We have a lot of rules in our party,

38:47.241 --> 38:50.202
but the most important is,
"Friends don't lie."

38:50.286 --> 38:52.288
Never ever. No matter what.

38:52.371 --> 38:53.372
Is that right?

38:54.874 --> 38:56.792
Then how do you explain this?

38:58.210 --> 39:00.713
[sighs] I had to do that. To protect you.

39:00.796 --> 39:03.049
To protect me from who, exactly?

39:03.132 --> 39:05.468
The big bad government baddies
from Hawkins Lab?

39:05.551 --> 39:06.552
Lower your voice.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.680
Maybe it was to protect me from
the Demogorgon from another dimension?

39:09.764 --> 39:11.404
- Max, I'm serious, shut up!
- Oh, no, no!

39:11.474 --> 39:13.517
You know what it was?
It was Eleven. The girl...

39:14.101 --> 39:16.228
Stop talking.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.565
You're going to get us killed.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.984
Do you understand?

39:24.862 --> 39:26.030
You're serious?

39:26.781 --> 39:29.033
I really wish I wasn't.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.202
Prove it.

39:33.579 --> 39:34.622
I can't.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.540
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?

39:36.999 --> 39:37.833
Yes.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.878
- [car engine revving]
- [tires screeching]

39:44.965 --> 39:46.884
Shit. I gotta go. Um...

39:47.843 --> 39:50.346
Don't follow me out. Okay?

39:51.722 --> 39:52.973
Do you believe me?

39:54.642 --> 39:56.644
[rock song playing on stereo]

40:00.815 --> 40:02.191
The hell I tell you?

40:02.858 --> 40:03.734
I'm not late.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.361
You know what I'm talking about.

40:06.612 --> 40:09.031
- Oh, Lucas?
- [scoffs]

40:09.115 --> 40:11.992
- So he has a name now, huh?
- [stammers]

40:12.076 --> 40:14.203
It's a small town, okay?
We weren't hanging out.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.498
Hmm. Well, you know
what happens when you lie.

40:18.707 --> 40:19.708
I'm not lying.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.639
[Owens on tape]
What if they try to replicate that?

40:33.722 --> 40:35.362
The more attention we bring to ourselves,

40:35.433 --> 40:37.726
the more people like the Hollands
who know the truth,

40:37.810 --> 40:39.728
the more likely that scenario becomes.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.481
You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.

40:42.565 --> 40:46.569
Just the same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.

40:46.652 --> 40:47.778
[tape recorder clicks]

40:49.238 --> 40:52.032
So, is it enough?

40:55.202 --> 41:00.166
The tape recording, is it enough?
[stutters] Is it incriminating?

41:16.932 --> 41:18.225
[liquid pouring]

41:18.309 --> 41:19.602
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

41:19.685 --> 41:20.728
With vodka?

41:20.811 --> 41:24.273
It's a central nervous system depressant.
So yes, with vodka.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.491
[Nancy] Music? Really?

41:33.574 --> 41:35.534
Yes. It helps me...

41:36.327 --> 41:38.579
- [Jonathan] What? Think?
- [sighs heavily]

41:43.709 --> 41:45.711
[jazz song playing]

41:54.470 --> 41:56.138
How long is this gonna take?

41:56.222 --> 41:58.057
Longer if you keep talking.

41:58.140 --> 42:01.810
Is the tape incriminating or not?
It's a simple question.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.312
[laughs]

42:03.896 --> 42:05.176
There's nothing simple about it.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.917
Nothing simple about anything
you've told me.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.400
You don't believe us, do you?

42:08.484 --> 42:10.444
I believe you, but that's not the problem.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.906
You don't need me to believe you.
You need them to believe you.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.282
- Them?
- Them.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.493
With a capital "T."

42:17.576 --> 42:23.707
Your priest, your postman, your teacher,
the world at large. [scoffs]

42:23.791 --> 42:25.084
They won't believe any of this.

42:25.167 --> 42:27.169
That's why we made the tape.

42:27.253 --> 42:30.339
Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy.

42:30.422 --> 42:33.759
He admits it. You heard it.
He admits culpability.

42:33.842 --> 42:35.594
You're being naive, Nancy!

42:36.220 --> 42:37.221
Those people...

42:37.304 --> 42:38.389
[chuckles]

42:39.056 --> 42:41.517
They're not wired like me and you, okay?

42:41.600 --> 42:45.813
They don't spend their lives trying to get
a look at what's behind the curtain.

42:46.438 --> 42:48.107
[chuckles] They like the curtain.

42:48.190 --> 42:51.277
It provides them stability,
comfort, definition.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.361
This...

42:53.112 --> 42:54.405
this would open the curtain,

42:54.488 --> 42:57.032
and open the curtain
behind that curtain, okay?

42:57.116 --> 43:02.037
So the minute someone
with an ounce of authority calls bullshit,

43:02.121 --> 43:07.626
everyone will nod their heads and say,
"See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit."

43:07.710 --> 43:10.212
That is, if you even get
their attention at all.

43:10.296 --> 43:12.056
You're saying we did all of this
for nothing?

43:12.131 --> 43:14.383
I'm saying, I'm thinking.

43:17.970 --> 43:18.971
Ooh!

43:20.347 --> 43:21.347
[grunts]

43:28.147 --> 43:29.773
[Jonathan] This is ridiculous.

43:30.316 --> 43:33.193
- That's it. That's it!
- What's it?

43:33.277 --> 43:36.363
It's just too strong. Too strong.

43:40.492 --> 43:41.492
Better.

43:49.752 --> 43:50.753
Perfect.

43:53.130 --> 43:54.173
We water it down.

43:54.256 --> 43:57.134
- Precisely.
- Wait. What?

43:57.217 --> 44:00.179
Your story. We moderate it.

44:02.598 --> 44:03.891
Just like this drink here.

44:04.683 --> 44:06.935
We make it more tolerable.

44:07.895 --> 44:14.526
Perhaps Barbara was exposed
to some dangerous toxins.

44:14.610 --> 44:18.155
A leak from the lab.
Like Three Mile Island or something.

44:18.238 --> 44:21.075
Something scary but familiar.

44:22.326 --> 44:25.704
Close enough that it hits the man
right where it hurts.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.499
And those assholes that killed Barb...

44:28.582 --> 44:29.875
They'll go down.

44:30.584 --> 44:31.877
[takes deep breath]

44:36.799 --> 44:38.479
[Owens] All right, what are we looking at?

44:38.509 --> 44:40.909
[lab technician] This was some of the soil
we took yesterday.

44:41.387 --> 44:44.306
Okay. So what is your concern?

44:44.390 --> 44:47.309
Well, we didn't find
any signs of contamination.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.020
Uh, nothing hazardous
other than some pesticides.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.438
Well, it's a farm.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.108
Right, right. Exactly. But...

45:24.513 --> 45:25.514
Like this?

45:27.266 --> 45:28.266
Yes.

45:29.351 --> 45:30.936
[static hissing]

45:33.355 --> 45:34.940
It's okay if I sit here, right?

45:36.191 --> 45:37.067
Yes.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.528
[stammers] And I won't mess it up
or anything?

45:39.611 --> 45:40.863
- No.
- Okay.

45:41.447 --> 45:45.325
If you talk to Terry, will you tell her
that I love her very much?

45:45.409 --> 45:47.494
And that I'm sorry that I didn't believe...

45:47.578 --> 45:49.955
- Stop talking.
- Okay, sorry.

45:51.999 --> 45:55.878
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.755
Three to the right. Four to the left.

45:59.673 --> 46:00.674
Four-fifty.

46:01.925 --> 46:03.010
Breathe.

46:03.886 --> 46:07.639
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

46:08.474 --> 46:11.477
Three to the right. Four to the left.
Four-fifty.

46:12.478 --> 46:14.354
- Breathe.
- Mama?

46:15.063 --> 46:18.442
- Sunflower. Rainbow.
- Mama, it's me...

46:18.525 --> 46:20.360
Three to the right. Four to the left.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.904
- Four-fifty.
- Jane.

46:22.529 --> 46:24.281
Breathe. Sunflower.

46:24.364 --> 46:25.491
I'm here now.

46:26.575 --> 46:27.784
Four-fifty.

46:28.827 --> 46:32.623
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

46:32.706 --> 46:33.874
I'm home.

46:34.541 --> 46:35.541
No.

46:39.338 --> 46:40.339
[echoing] Mama!

46:42.007 --> 46:43.258
[Terry sobbing]

- [sobbing]

46:54.603 --> 46:56.021
- Oh, my baby!
- What do I do?

46:56.104 --> 46:58.333
- Mama, what do I do? Help me!
- [Becky] Breathe. Breathe.

46:58.357 --> 47:01.401
Just breathe. Breathe.
Just breathe, all right?

47:01.485 --> 47:02.653
They're on their way.

47:02.736 --> 47:04.238
- They're on their way, okay?
- Okay.

47:04.321 --> 47:05.322
[gasping]

47:05.405 --> 47:08.116
Stay with us, darling. Stay with us.

[monitor beeping]

47:42.776 --> 47:43.652
Hey, there.

47:43.735 --> 47:44.735
[sighs]

47:46.905 --> 47:47.739
Jane?

47:47.823 --> 47:50.200
- Where's Jane?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

47:50.284 --> 47:51.451
No, I saw her.

47:51.535 --> 47:53.787
- No, no, she wasn't breathing.
- She was crying.

47:54.496 --> 47:56.790
- No.
- I heard it. He was there.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.209
- Who was there?
- He took her.

47:59.293 --> 48:01.336
[Becky] Don't take it out! Terry!

48:01.837 --> 48:03.797
- Terry!
- [Terry] No! No!

48:03.880 --> 48:05.841
- Please don't!
- [nurse speaking indistinctly]

48:05.924 --> 48:08.719
[Terry] Three to the right.
Four to the left.

48:08.802 --> 48:09.802

48:36.330 --> 48:37.914
Ma'am, can I see your badge?

48:39.499 --> 48:41.501
Stay back. Stay back!

48:42.711 --> 48:44.338

Jane? Jane?

49:01.438 --> 49:03.398
Jane... No!

49:03.482 --> 49:06.985
No! No! She's my child! No!

49:07.069 --> 49:08.987
She's my child!

49:12.074 --> 49:14.034
No! No.

No.

49:17.204 --> 49:18.455

[muffled screaming]

49:37.557 --> 49:39.559
[gasping]

49:40.477 --> 49:42.354
Breathe. They're on their way.

49:42.979 --> 49:44.231
[nurse] Stay with us, darling.

49:44.314 --> 49:46.149
- [baby crying]
- [Terry] Sunflower.

49:47.234 --> 49:48.902
Three to the right. Four to the left.

49:48.985 --> 49:51.780
- Rainbow. Four-fifty.
- Breathe.

49:51.863 --> 49:54.950
- [baby crying]
- [Terry] Sunflower. Rainbow.

49:55.033 --> 49:55.951
Jane... No!

49:56.034 --> 49:57.411
- Four-fifty.
- Breathe.

49:57.494 --> 49:59.996
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- [Becky] Breathe.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.833
- [Terry] Sunflower. Rainbow.
- [Becky] Breathe.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.811
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- [Becky] Breathe.

50:04.835 --> 50:06.503
[Terry] Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.

50:06.586 --> 50:08.088
[gasping]

50:08.171 --> 50:13.343
Sunflower. Rainbow.
Three to the right. Four to the left.

50:13.427 --> 50:18.306
Four-fifty. Breathe. Sunflower.

50:21.143 --> 50:22.978
There's nothing. There's nothing here.

50:23.061 --> 50:25.272
- Are... Are we close?
- We're in the vicinity.

50:25.355 --> 50:26.582
What's that mean, the vicinity?

50:26.606 --> 50:28.900
It means we're close.
I don't know. It's not precise.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.026
But we did all that work.

50:30.110 --> 50:33.697
[Bob] I told you, the scale ratio is not
exactly one-to-one. We needed to take...

50:33.780 --> 50:35.449
- Turn right.
- What?

50:35.532 --> 50:37.075
- I saw him.
- Where?

50:37.159 --> 50:38.410
Not here. In my now-memories.

50:39.411 --> 50:40.787
- [Bob] In your what?
- Turn right!

50:41.246 --> 50:42.372
[tires screeching]

50:43.415 --> 50:45.041
[all screaming]

50:51.381 --> 50:52.424
Are you okay?

50:54.509 --> 50:55.427
Superspy.

50:55.510 --> 50:57.679
What's Jim doing here? Joyce?

50:57.763 --> 51:02.392
- Boys, I need you to stay here.
- No. Mom, Mom, Mom, it's not safe.

51:02.476 --> 51:05.353
That's why I need you to stay here!
Stay here!

51:06.688 --> 51:07.689
Hopper!

51:09.775 --> 51:11.443
- Hey, be careful.
- [panting]

51:11.526 --> 51:13.028
Just going down the hole.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.238
Vines.

51:17.824 --> 51:18.700
Give me that.

51:18.784 --> 51:20.994
- The shovel?
- Yes, give me the shovel.

51:25.207 --> 51:26.583
[Joyce gasps]

51:29.920 --> 51:31.713
[screeching]

51:33.340 --> 51:35.383
[sighs] I need you to help me
get down there.

51:35.467 --> 51:38.512
- Joyce, what are you talking about?
- Bob! Now!

51:48.230 --> 51:50.232
[breathing heavily]

51:50.941 --> 51:52.359
Hopper!

51:53.443 --> 51:55.153
Hopper!

51:55.987 --> 51:58.573
- Hopper!
- [Bob grunts]

51:58.657 --> 52:01.497
- Joyce, what is going on? Where are we?
- [stammers] Bob, are you okay?

52:01.535 --> 52:04.663
- [panting]
- Tunnels. Is this Will's map?

52:04.746 --> 52:05.747
Hopper!

52:05.831 --> 52:07.457
Are we in Will's map?

52:07.541 --> 52:11.086
Hopper! Hopper!

52:11.169 --> 52:12.879
[Bob] We're in Will's map.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.381
[Joyce] Hopper!

52:14.464 --> 52:16.174
[Bob] We're actually inside of Will's map.

52:16.258 --> 52:17.258
[Joyce] Hopper!

52:17.300 --> 52:18.969
[Bob] How did he know all this?

52:26.017 --> 52:27.017
[Joyce] Bob!

52:27.727 --> 52:29.020
Over here!

52:29.771 --> 52:31.565
[stammers] It's his.

52:32.190 --> 52:34.442
[sighs] He's gotta be this way.

52:36.027 --> 52:38.029
Come on. [grunts]

52:41.324 --> 52:42.659
Hopper!

52:45.912 --> 52:49.374
Do you see anything?
I mean, in your now-memories?

52:54.254 --> 52:55.589
[tires screeching]

53:08.226 --> 53:09.936
[Joyce] Hopper!

53:10.562 --> 53:11.897
Hopper!

53:16.651 --> 53:17.651
What?

53:18.737 --> 53:19.737
This is...

53:22.407 --> 53:25.076
Oh! It's his arm.

53:28.163 --> 53:29.372
[Joyce grunting]

53:32.208 --> 53:33.585
[Bob] It's choking him.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.795
Knife.

53:35.879 --> 53:37.631
- [Joyce] Knife?
- It's over there.

53:37.714 --> 53:39.049
[Joyce] Okay.

53:39.132 --> 53:41.676
[all grunting]

53:41.760 --> 53:42.802
Hands!

53:43.637 --> 53:44.679
Hands!

53:45.472 --> 53:47.474
[coughs and grunts]

53:47.557 --> 53:48.767
Cut it...

53:51.186 --> 53:52.020
[screams]

53:52.103 --> 53:53.396
[screeches]

53:53.480 --> 53:55.565
Bastard!

53:55.649 --> 53:57.359
[screams]

53:58.818 --> 54:02.238
[Joyce panting] Oh, my God.
Hopper, are you okay?

54:02.322 --> 54:05.367
- Joyce.
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

54:06.493 --> 54:08.745
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Jim.

54:08.828 --> 54:11.081
- [screeches]
- [Joyce] Oh, God!

54:11.164 --> 54:12.499
[Joyce screams]

54:12.582 --> 54:15.335
Go! Go! Go! Clear the area!

54:15.418 --> 54:16.252
- Go!
- [Hopper] Wait.

54:16.336 --> 54:17.545
[man] Move, now!

54:19.005 --> 54:20.882
[indistinct chatter]

54:22.759 --> 54:23.759
[screeching]

54:23.802 --> 54:25.553
[Will grunting]

54:25.637 --> 54:26.972
[Mike] Will? Will, you okay?

54:28.723 --> 54:30.058
- Will, what's wrong?
- [grunting]

54:31.726 --> 54:32.811
[screeching]

54:32.894 --> 54:34.270
[Will screaming]
