00:14.223 --> 00:16.725
<i>Bill Peterson: Whenever I think</i>
<i>of circumstantial evidence,</i>

00:16.808 --> 00:19.144
<i>ladies and gentleman, I think of snow.</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:21.313
<i>Think about this.</i>

00:22.231 --> 00:25.567
<i>You're standing at your picture window.</i>
<i>It's cold outside.</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:29.446
<i>Below 30 degrees, typical winter evening.</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:31.031
<i>Gray, overcast skies.</i>

00:32.032 --> 00:34.159
<i>You're looking outside</i>
<i>and it begins to snow</i>

00:34.243 --> 00:35.285
<i>and you watch it snow.</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:37.454
<i>And it snows and snows and snows.</i>

00:37.913 --> 00:38.997
<i>And it gets deep.</i>

00:39.081 --> 00:41.583
<i>It's four or five inches on the ground</i>
<i>while you're standing there,</i>

00:41.667 --> 00:42.584
<i>and then you quit.</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:45.170
<i>Nobody has to tell you it's snowing.</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:47.464
<i>Same circumstances.</i>

00:48.006 --> 00:50.926
<i>Looking out of your window,</i>
<i>a blustery, cold night.</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.262
<i>Gray, overcast skies and you go to bed.</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:57.057
<i>Next morning you wake up and there's</i>
<i>four or five inches of snow on the ground.</i>

00:57.140 --> 00:59.017
<i>Nobody has to tell you it snowed.</i>

00:59.560 --> 01:00.435
<i>It snowed.</i>

01:01.103 --> 01:02.521
<i>But you didn't see it snow.</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:04.898
<i>If you take...</i>

01:05.649 --> 01:07.067
<i>the defendant's position...</i>

01:07.818 --> 01:09.027
<i>"I plead not guilty...</i>

01:09.653 --> 01:10.737
<i>"I didn't do it..."</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:15.075
<i>For that to be true,</i>
<i>there would have to be two other males</i>

01:15.826 --> 01:19.705
<i>and they have both pubic and head hair</i>

01:20.038 --> 01:21.873
<i>that are consistent with the defendants.</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:25.877
<i>And that they got together</i>
<i>in the early morning hours...</i>

01:26.295 --> 01:28.505
<i>on December 8th, 1982...</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:32.884
<i>and ended up in Debbie Carter's...</i>

01:33.552 --> 01:34.636
<i>apartment.</i>

01:35.053 --> 01:36.138
<i>That's incredible.</i>

01:37.723 --> 01:38.765
<i>Or...</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:42.269
<i>there's a giant conspiracy going on...</i>

01:42.853 --> 01:45.480
<i>between the OSBI...</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:47.357
<i>witnesses...</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:49.693
<i>and the District Attorney's office.</i>

13:43.865 --> 13:45.700
<i>Lawyer: Donna Haraway had been receiving</i>

13:45.783 --> 13:48.870
<i>obscene and harassing phone calls</i>
<i>at McAnally's.</i>

13:48.953 --> 13:53.833
<i>Did you disclose that testimony</i>
<i>to George Butner?</i>

13:53.916 --> 13:55.001
<i>Bill Peterson: I have no idea.</i>

13:55.084 --> 13:58.379
<i>Lawyer: Is that the type of material</i>
<i>that you would disclose to Mr. Butner?</i>

13:58.463 --> 14:01.424
<i>Bill Peterson: I can't say that I would,</i>
<i>I can't say that I wouldn't.</i>

14:01.507 --> 14:03.676
<i>At this point in time, I don't know.</i>

14:28.242 --> 14:31.788
<i>Lawyer: Did the defense attorney</i>
<i>have full access to the prosecutorial?</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:35.666
<i>Bill Peterson: I can't answer that. He</i>
<i>did not have access to my prosecutorial.</i>

14:35.750 --> 14:38.211
<i>Lawyer: Did you provide him</i>
<i>a copy of the prosecutorial?</i>

14:38.294 --> 14:40.630
<i>Bill Peterson: I have no recollection</i>
<i>of doing that one way or another.</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:42.298
<i>Lawyer: As a matter of policy,</i>
<i>did you provide--</i>

14:42.382 --> 14:43.216
<i>Bill Peterson: No, I did not.</i>

16:22.815 --> 16:24.859
<i>Bill Peterson: We had an open file policy.</i>

16:24.942 --> 16:28.112
<i>If it was in my office,</i>
<i>they could come and access it.</i>

16:28.196 --> 16:29.739
<i>I felt no obligation</i>

16:29.822 --> 16:34.076
<i>to dig through the files</i>
<i>for the defense attorney</i>

16:34.160 --> 16:37.455
<i>to determine what is</i>
<i>or what is not exculpatory.</i>

16:37.538 --> 16:39.624
<i>My opinion of what might be exculpatory</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:43.794
<i>may be totally different, or not,</i>
<i>from the defense attorney's.</i>

16:45.880 --> 16:48.341
I've read your depositions

16:48.424 --> 16:52.595
and a lot of it deals with the flow of
information between the cops and the DA.

16:53.346 --> 16:58.392
And it reads a little bit
like a system of plausible deniability.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.386
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>it was a it was a big cover-up, Tommy?</i>

17:35.263 --> 17:36.889
<i>I think so, yes.</i>

17:36.973 --> 17:40.601
<i>Dennis Smith, for instance,</i>
<i>he was the main ringleader.</i>

17:41.394 --> 17:44.981
<i>And Dennis, he was coming up</i>
<i>for retirement and things</i>

17:45.064 --> 17:48.568
<i>and here he had the Haraway case,</i>

17:49.193 --> 17:53.155
<i>the Carter case, and he'd not been able</i>
<i>to solve nothing.</i>

17:53.239 --> 17:56.033
<i>And he wanted a name for himself</i>
<i>before he retired.</i>

22:10.538 --> 22:11.664
<i>Rusty Featherstone: Can you tell me</i>

22:11.747 --> 22:13.415
<i>what her blouse looked like</i>
<i>that she was wearing?</i>

22:15.209 --> 22:18.796
<i>White with little blue... roses on it.</i>

22:27.888 --> 22:30.224
<i>Detective: Did it have any lace</i>
<i>around the collar?</i>

22:30.307 --> 22:32.685
<i>Yes, it had ruffles around the collar,</i>
<i>like the front.</i>

26:36.303 --> 26:38.597
<i>He said that he tried to go</i>
<i>with Debbie Carter...</i>

26:39.223 --> 26:41.266
<i>and she wouldn't have</i>
<i>nothing to do with him.</i>

26:41.725 --> 26:45.020
<i>And he said that if she'd have just</i>
<i>went ahead and went with him,</i>

26:45.104 --> 26:46.396
<i>he wouldn't have killed her.</i>

26:49.024 --> 26:50.984
<i>Lawyer: Did you ever hear him describe</i>

26:51.068 --> 26:54.029
<i>or talk about any of the details</i>
<i>of Debbie Carter's death?</i>

26:55.155 --> 26:58.826
<i>He said he shoved a Coke bottle up her ass</i>
<i>and her panties down her throat.</i>

26:58.909 --> 27:00.577
<i>Ron Williamson: You are lying!</i>

27:01.245 --> 27:03.497
<i>I ain't ever said anything like that</i>
<i>in my life!</i>

27:03.580 --> 27:05.415
<i>I did not kill this girl.</i>

27:05.499 --> 27:07.334
<i>I call you a liar!</i>

31:38.605 --> 31:40.816
Jason Holland:
My mom was in this biker gang.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.861
And she was third from the top,
hierarchy. Okay?

34:10.882 --> 34:13.134
We were headed to my house
to play poker.

34:13.218 --> 34:14.844
And we needed change...

34:15.720 --> 34:20.016
so we stopped at McAnally's
to get change for the poker game.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.601
I pulled up with my...

34:21.685 --> 34:23.436
I was in my pickup.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.939
Older nephew, Lenny,
went inside the store.

34:27.941 --> 34:30.235
As he went in, a couple came out.

34:30.318 --> 34:33.029
Didn't appear to be any struggle
or anything like that.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.541
Well, I'd already seen...

34:44.624 --> 34:47.377
They'd shown me a picture
right after they just arrested him.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.087
I said, "Well, that looks like the guy."

34:49.170 --> 34:52.507
I said, "If I see him inÂ person,
I could probably say for sure."

34:52.591 --> 34:55.010
So they went over to the jail...

34:55.719 --> 34:57.804
and had the jailer bring him out.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.182
And as soon as I saw Tommy come out...

35:01.933 --> 35:03.810
it hit me that, you know, that's him.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.520
And then, after that...

35:06.229 --> 35:08.315
they told me
they were going to have a line-up.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.109
And they asked me
to pick out the one that...

35:11.192 --> 35:13.778
So I picked out Tommy Ward.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.868
It tainted the line-up.

35:28.001 --> 35:32.255
Everyone deserves
a good defense and a fair trial.

35:32.339 --> 35:35.592
And I don't really feel
like he had a fair trial.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.303
And I wanted to do more than I could do.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.055
I didn't have any...

35:40.639 --> 35:41.473
insight...

35:42.474 --> 35:43.892
into the situation.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.186
I'd hate to think that I...

35:48.271 --> 35:50.440
contributed to putting
an innocent man in jail.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.985
The whole system's broken.
They all work together.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.780
The District Attorney's Office is the hub.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.325
I think the police overstep their bounds.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.328
Just a lot of things that were wrong.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.270
<i>And you said Titsdale?</i>

38:35.104 --> 38:36.189
<i>-Titsworth.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

38:36.272 --> 38:37.273
<i>-Odell?</i>
<i>-Odell.</i>

38:38.316 --> 38:42.529
<i>They also claim police and prosecutors</i>
<i>withheld over 800 pages of records</i>

38:42.612 --> 38:44.656
<i>from Haraway's disappearance and death.</i>

39:33.454 --> 39:35.623
<i>Lawyer: You don't believe</i>
<i>that there is any</i>

39:35.707 --> 39:37.709
<i>modicum, scintilla</i>

39:37.792 --> 39:39.752
<i>of an alternate suspect?</i>

39:39.836 --> 39:40.712
<i>Bill Peterson: No.</i>

39:40.795 --> 39:44.132
<i>Lawyer: It's your testimony that you</i>
<i>do not know who Floyd Degraw is?</i>

39:44.215 --> 39:45.341
<i>Bill Peterson: I have no idea.</i>

39:50.346 --> 39:51.848
Kim Byars: That's Billy Charley.

40:44.734 --> 40:45.902
<i>Thomas Ward.</i>

40:46.694 --> 40:47.528
<i>Hello.</i>

40:51.240 --> 40:52.241
<i>How are you doing?</i>

40:54.160 --> 40:56.245
<i>Oh, okay. Hanging in there.</i>

41:01.084 --> 41:03.336
<i>Yeah, I have been going over everything</i>

41:03.419 --> 41:07.131
<i>and, well, everything, to my knowledge,</i>
<i>you know, sounds really good.</i>

41:07.715 --> 41:09.884
<i>He did an outstanding job on it, you know.</i>

41:11.052 --> 41:14.013
<i>I just keep saying my prayers, you know,</i>
<i>that something will come through</i>

41:14.097 --> 41:16.349
<i>to reveal my innocence, you know.</i>

41:17.850 --> 41:21.145
<i>There's so many people out there,</i>
<i>you know, that believe in me and care.</i>

41:21.771 --> 41:27.485
<i>And I pray that something positive</i>
<i>comes out in the end, you know.</i>

41:28.778 --> 41:31.614
<i>To get out of here</i>
<i>and be able to be with my family...</i>

41:32.448 --> 41:36.327
<i>and enjoy the remainder of my life</i>
<i>that I have left anyway, you know.</i>

41:39.831 --> 41:41.833
<i>Take care.</i>
<i>It's sure good to hear your voice.</i>

41:42.291 --> 41:45.128
<i>Take care. Many blessings.</i><i>Bye, bye.</i>

44:48.978 --> 44:51.606
<i>Everything that has to be said</i>
<i>or needs to be said,</i>

44:51.689 --> 44:53.608
<i>I'm sure it's documentedÂ somewhere.</i>

44:53.691 --> 44:56.402
<i>They just keep dragging it back up</i>
<i>and dragging it back up</i>

44:56.485 --> 44:57.987
<i>and dragging it back up.</i>

44:58.654 --> 45:00.615
<i>So, you know, it depends</i>
<i>on what side of the fence you're on.</i>

45:00.698 --> 45:02.366
<i>You're either the hero or the goat.</i>

45:03.201 --> 45:05.786
<i>And, like I say, I'm just tired.</i>

45:26.349 --> 45:29.435
<i>You know, whenever you see a movie</i>
<i>on the television,</i>

45:29.518 --> 45:31.187
<i>they always get the right guy.</i>

45:31.270 --> 45:33.564
<i>And if they've mistakenly</i>
<i>got the wrong guy,</i>

45:33.648 --> 45:37.485
<i>it winds up at the end, you know,</i>
<i>they get the right guy.</i>

45:38.444 --> 45:40.696
<i>It's not like in the movies, you know.</i>

45:41.530 --> 45:44.242
<i>You know, in this field,</i>
<i>they get the wrong guy</i>

45:44.325 --> 45:46.118
<i>and it's just never-ending.</i>
