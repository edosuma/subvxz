- Oh, my God.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.440
(wailing)

00:13.440 --> 00:14.750
RAMI: And your fighters...
how many survived?

00:14.780 --> 00:16.710
Enough to take
the antiaircraft battery

00:16.740 --> 00:17.760
from the Caliphate.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.550
Taking the battery
is one thing,

00:19.580 --> 00:21.800
holding on to it until
our planes can land is another.

00:21.840 --> 00:22.910
We know the risk.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.200
General Said is briefing

00:24.230 --> 00:26.020
<i>his soldiers
later this morning.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:27.810
When his motorcade
passes,

00:27.850 --> 00:29.970
my operative
will detonate an IED.

00:30.010 --> 00:32.229
There is a bomb on the road.

00:32.259 --> 00:34.320
- A bomb?
- So tell the driver

00:34.350 --> 00:36.530
to stop the car...

00:39.500 --> 00:41.970
MAHMOUD: General Said!
You are under arrest

00:42.010 --> 00:43.790
for the murder
of Amira Al Fayeed.

00:43.790 --> 00:46.440
Ask yourselves... if we've
come to this, who's safe now?

00:46.470 --> 00:48.680
- Tell me what really happened.
- I don't know.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.980
Was it father? Was he
trying to kill my brother

00:51.010 --> 00:53.380
instead of the
other way around?

00:53.420 --> 00:54.880
Everything dies
around your father.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.520
And you stood by his side!

00:56.550 --> 00:58.900
You stayed silent.
You took the deal!

00:58.930 --> 01:01.890
Sammy, the military
is not coming.

01:01.930 --> 01:04.430
Your father is on his own.

01:04.470 --> 01:05.530
HALIMA:
This is base camp. Khalil,

01:05.570 --> 01:08.150
please respond immediately.
I repeat,

01:08.180 --> 01:10.070
(staticky): this is base camp.
Khalil, please respond

01:10.110 --> 01:10.810
immediately.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.330
I repeat, please
respond immediately.

01:13.370 --> 01:14.980
(wind gusting)

01:25.300 --> 01:27.570
Ru'a Al-Zara.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.250
- Zara.
- Zara.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.140
- JANE: Yeah.
- IHAB: Okay, wait...

01:35.180 --> 01:35.990
(tapping keys)

01:36.020 --> 01:36.990
IHAB:
Next.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.990
Dirar El-Nami.

01:40.030 --> 01:43.160
Okay...
(whispers indistinctly)

01:43.200 --> 01:45.980
What is this?

01:46.010 --> 01:47.430
It's Khalil's men.

01:47.470 --> 01:50.180
If that's even his real name.

01:50.220 --> 01:52.020
So we need to figure out

01:52.050 --> 01:54.860
if he was among
the ones we killed.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.430
His movement is finished.

01:58.460 --> 02:01.580
Whether he's dead or alive
makes no difference.

02:01.620 --> 02:05.580
Perhaps you would
feel differently

02:05.610 --> 02:08.870
if it was your wife he murdered.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.460
I'm leaving for Raqqa
to see my brother.

02:14.490 --> 02:15.730
Okay.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.860
Ihab...

02:21.540 --> 02:25.110
Don't let vengeance distract
you from our real target.

02:25.140 --> 02:29.700
Khalil was just a detour on
the way to Jamal Al Fayeed.

02:30.780 --> 02:33.630
Sir, our most
recent assessment

02:33.670 --> 02:36.410
of the Caliphate forces.

02:36.450 --> 02:40.030
The numbers are disappointing.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.440
(inhales)
Tell me.

02:41.470 --> 02:44.010
I suggest you look at
the numbers yourself, sir.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.760
The Caliphate's revenue
is far greater

02:48.800 --> 02:51.480
than our previous
estimates, uh...

02:51.520 --> 02:53.330
Mm. Well...

02:53.370 --> 02:55.730
they control our oil fields.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.940
Well, it...
it isn't just the oil, sir.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.770
Aid is pouring in through
their regional affiliates.

03:01.810 --> 03:04.700
Their military capability
is growing while ours

03:04.740 --> 03:07.420
is... stalled.

03:08.810 --> 03:11.080
(sighs deeply)

03:11.120 --> 03:13.830
Uh, Mr. President, uh,

03:13.870 --> 03:15.870
I... I have been talking

03:15.910 --> 03:17.590
to our...
(clears throat)

03:17.620 --> 03:20.950
Well, my-my counterpart
in-in Burkina Faso.

03:20.980 --> 03:22.650
About?

03:23.660 --> 03:26.930
His president is willing
to grant political asylum

03:26.970 --> 03:29.280
to you and to your family.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.140
Mm.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.940
Are you telling me
to run away, Mahmoud?

03:35.970 --> 03:37.140
No... (soft chuckle)

03:37.180 --> 03:38.780
I'm giving you an option.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.690
Before it is
too late to take it.

03:40.730 --> 03:43.060
This... would protect you

03:43.100 --> 03:46.280
from any war crimes charges
brought against you by the ICC,

03:46.310 --> 03:48.280
and, as I mentioned,

03:48.320 --> 03:51.260
it would include
your extended family.

03:51.290 --> 03:53.960
And yours.

03:55.050 --> 03:56.860
- Well...
- (intercom rings)

03:56.900 --> 03:58.850
ASSISTANT: I'm sorry to
interrupt, Mr. President,

03:58.880 --> 04:01.130
but your sister-in-law
is here to see you.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.700
She says it's urgent.

04:02.730 --> 04:04.700
Molly is here? Why?

04:04.740 --> 04:08.050
She was with
Mrs. Al Fayeed earlier.

04:09.970 --> 04:13.480
Mm-hmm.
Well, Mahmoud will show her in.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.779
I won't run away.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.279
I'm not a coward.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.950
Neither will you, Mahmoud.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.220
Assemble the chiefs of staff.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.870
I want to hear their plans

04:26.900 --> 04:30.160
to defend Asima
against the Caliphate.

04:30.190 --> 04:32.550
- Sir.
- Mm.

04:37.390 --> 04:42.140
(sighs heavily)

04:48.380 --> 04:50.310
Molly.

04:52.550 --> 04:55.250
A sign of my guilt,

04:55.290 --> 04:57.750
like Cain.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.650
I hope I won't bear it
for the rest of my life.

05:00.690 --> 05:03.150
Jamal, Barry's alive.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.900
What?

05:06.930 --> 05:09.460
The man you know
as Khalil.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.530
The man who's been fighting
the Caliphate inside Ma'an.

05:12.570 --> 05:15.270
That's Barry.

05:19.310 --> 05:21.380
Bassam is not dead?

05:21.410 --> 05:23.880
I only found out myself
a few days ago.

05:23.910 --> 05:26.610
And now he's gone in
without any support.

05:26.650 --> 05:28.800
So unless you let
General Said go,

05:28.830 --> 05:31.250
you'll be killing him
a second time.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.890
Liar.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.580
How else could I know
you switched him

05:35.620 --> 05:38.030
with another man
at the gallows?

05:38.520 --> 05:41.730
That you left him
in the desert to die?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.950
That he only survived
because a Bedouin took him in?

05:43.990 --> 05:46.020
Arif told you.

05:46.050 --> 05:49.200
I should have thrown him
from the helicopter.

05:49.230 --> 05:51.800
He fled to Dubai, and
now I understand why.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.880
I'm trying to save my husband.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.330
- Are you?
- Yes.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.220
Or are you plotting with Rami?

05:58.250 --> 05:59.590
Tell me...

05:59.620 --> 06:01.830
how did he find you?

06:01.870 --> 06:05.170
- Or did you find him?
- Barry is alive.

06:05.210 --> 06:06.750
I swear to you.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.890
Something is wrong.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.790
What are these tricks
and plots?

06:11.830 --> 06:15.790
How could Rami do all
of this from prison?

06:15.820 --> 06:17.640
I won't fall for it.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.900
- Do you hear me?
- LEILA: Jamal!

06:19.930 --> 06:22.100
Jamal...

06:25.810 --> 06:27.880
Leave her alone!

06:48.230 --> 06:50.370
Molly, Molly, please, wait.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.530
- Please...
- What?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.800
Is it true?

06:56.840 --> 06:59.480
Is Bassam really alive?

07:06.150 --> 07:09.460
Group Three, come in.

07:10.450 --> 07:15.210
I repeat, Group Three,
report your position.

07:16.390 --> 07:18.990
They can't hear us
over the wind.

07:21.230 --> 07:23.630
Bring these goggles to them.
Suleiman...

07:23.660 --> 07:24.900
- Mm-hmm.
- go with him.

07:24.930 --> 07:27.100
Come.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.610
Suleiman!

07:47.400 --> 07:49.420
(rapid gunfire,
men grunting)

07:50.490 --> 07:51.640
Khalil!

07:51.680 --> 07:54.190
Come on!

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
Who wants tea?

08:12.080 --> 08:14.940
MAN (staticky):
Come in, Base One.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.750
This is Base One. Come in.

08:18.780 --> 08:20.520
This is Ibrahim.

08:20.550 --> 08:23.850
(weakly):
Khalil.

08:23.890 --> 08:25.390
He is coming.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.510
Did you say Khalil?

08:33.230 --> 08:35.830
- You all right?
- Fine. Just a scratch.

08:35.870 --> 08:38.570
We need to find and locate the
command and control console.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.730
HALIMA: This is base camp.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.600
Answer if you can hear me.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.650
This is Khalil.

08:43.679 --> 08:47.410
- We've taken the antiaircraft battery.
- General Said isn't coming.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.770
No one is coming.

08:48.810 --> 08:51.530
That's why we've
been trying to reach you.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.780
What do you mean
no one is coming?

08:53.820 --> 08:55.980
Jamal had General Said
arrested.

08:56.020 --> 08:58.080
And Solomon's leaving
the country with his men.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.090
Sammy's mother found out.
She will tell you the details,

09:00.120 --> 09:02.260
but you have to get out
of there.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.940
Okay, listen up.
We need to fall back.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.000
I'll explain once we're safe,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.300
but we need to get out of here
before the storm passes.

09:09.330 --> 09:11.530
Caliphate
coming from the south.

09:21.610 --> 09:24.010
We can't retreat.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.140
We're surrounded.

10:41.190 --> 10:44.700
I watched him die.
I mourned him.

10:45.880 --> 10:49.280
I know you find that hard
to believe.

10:49.320 --> 10:53.220
All that matters to me is
that my husband needs your help.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.950
I can't help anyone.

10:54.990 --> 10:56.240
You killed him once.
You can't give up

10:56.280 --> 10:57.890
and watch him die again.

10:57.930 --> 11:00.820
Leila, this is
your chance, too.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.010
And Ahmed's.

11:02.050 --> 11:03.800
If Barry has an army
behind him, then...

11:03.830 --> 11:06.970
What? Then what?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.800
Ahmed's abandoned me.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.870
And I'm tied
to that man in there,

11:13.910 --> 11:17.640
that... horror of a man,

11:17.680 --> 11:20.850
no matter what I do.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.010
I tried to kill him.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.520
I took a gun

11:29.560 --> 11:33.030
and pointed it at him.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.090
But I couldn't.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.830
(sighs)

11:39.870 --> 11:42.200
Maybe I should be grateful.

11:42.230 --> 11:45.390
Maybe there are... still things

11:45.430 --> 11:48.310
that I can't bring myself to do.

11:51.620 --> 11:55.190
But my punishment is
that I will never be free.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.420
What if...

11:58.450 --> 12:01.990
we could figure out
how to free General Said?

12:02.020 --> 12:03.990
Could you do that?

12:04.020 --> 12:06.420
I know it's a long shot.

12:06.450 --> 12:09.690
But with him and Barry and
an army fighting in your name...

12:09.730 --> 12:11.200
and Ahmed's...

12:11.230 --> 12:14.170
who knows what could happen
on the other side?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.830
I mean, it's got
to be worth a chance, Leila.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.040
It's got to be better than this,
than giving up.

12:19.070 --> 12:22.040
Could you do that?

12:22.070 --> 12:25.010
Could you free the general?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.020
(sighs)

12:34.090 --> 12:37.990
I could speak to Mahmoud.

12:38.020 --> 12:43.460
I... think I might be able to
convince him, for his own sake.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.400
Except...

12:46.430 --> 12:48.620
- What?
- Except we'd have

12:48.650 --> 12:51.010
a general with no army.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.370
Jamal controls the treasury.

12:53.400 --> 12:57.900
I have no way
to pay Solomon's soldiers.

13:00.670 --> 13:02.770
I do.

13:06.790 --> 13:09.360
(gunfire, shouting)

13:49.020 --> 13:51.990
Now that the sandstorm
has passed, we're moving in!

13:52.030 --> 13:54.330
How can you be sure
that Khalil is among them?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.860
One of my men reported it
before he was killed.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.300
This man, Khalil,
I need to see him.

13:59.330 --> 14:00.770
I need to see him myself.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.030
You stand down
until I get there.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.970
They've taken over
our antiaircraft battery.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.370
Our airspace is vulnerable now!

14:08.410 --> 14:10.510
I can be there within the hour!

14:10.540 --> 14:13.650
I can kill Khalil and every one
of his men in 15 minutes!

14:13.680 --> 14:16.300
Commander, your job
is to follow my orders...

14:16.340 --> 14:18.320
it's not to question them!

14:18.350 --> 14:20.350
(phone beeps off)

14:20.390 --> 14:22.320
(gunfire continues)

14:22.360 --> 14:24.820
Shouldn't you be calling
Abu Omar?

14:24.860 --> 14:27.330
No.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.060
We don't need to
disturb him with this.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.360
Come on. Come on.

14:34.230 --> 14:36.040
(gunfire, shouting)

14:36.070 --> 14:38.570
I destroyed
their command console.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.930
At least they'll know
we were here.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.510
(gunfire stops)

14:44.540 --> 14:46.710
(stray gunshots)

14:46.750 --> 14:49.050
They've stopped shooting.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.850
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

14:50.890 --> 14:52.360
SIDDIQ and BARRY:
Hold your fire!

14:52.400 --> 14:54.290
(shouts repeating command
relaying into distance)

15:01.250 --> 15:03.090
What are they doing?

15:06.230 --> 15:10.500
Whatever they're doing,
they're not going anywhere.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.000
(indistinct chatter)

15:13.040 --> 15:14.870
Colonel.

15:14.910 --> 15:17.510
Madam First Lady.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.610
Your husband
is still in his chambers.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.510
I'm here to talk to you.

15:21.550 --> 15:24.380
About the death
of Amira Al Fayeed, Colonel.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.520
What I don't understand

15:29.550 --> 15:32.190
is how my husband let you live
this long.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.120
Surely you arranged for the bomb

15:34.160 --> 15:37.960
that mistakenly killed
his mother instead of Rami.

15:40.830 --> 15:44.830
That is a very strong
accusation, Madam First Lady.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.680
You don't honestly believe

15:47.720 --> 15:50.140
that anyone outside
your very little circle believes

15:50.170 --> 15:52.440
the official story, do you?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.680
If you'll excuse me,

15:54.710 --> 15:56.430
I have to arrange
for the defense of Asima.

15:56.460 --> 15:57.470
Asima?

15:57.500 --> 15:59.900
Asima is indefensible
without an army,

15:59.940 --> 16:03.090
and right now, Colonel,
you have half an army, at best.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.230
I have my orders, Madam.

16:05.260 --> 16:08.690
Do you read history books,
Colonel? The newspaper?

16:08.730 --> 16:11.850
Then you know of
Egypt, Libya, Iraq.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.170
When the Caliphate finishes
on Ma'an and turns on us,

16:14.200 --> 16:16.300
after they depose my husband,

16:16.330 --> 16:19.210
what do you think will happen
to you and me?

16:20.640 --> 16:23.780
I don't know what it is
you are asking me to do.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.390
Release Rami to lead
the counterattack on Ma'an.

16:26.430 --> 16:28.410
The-the president
will have me executed

16:28.450 --> 16:29.540
if I were to do that
without his order.

16:29.570 --> 16:31.220
Our deaths are already
pending, Colonel,

16:31.250 --> 16:33.980
if the Caliphate is not stopped.

16:38.150 --> 16:39.470
Come on.
Come on here.

16:39.500 --> 16:39.990
There we go.

16:40.030 --> 16:41.460
Come on...

16:41.490 --> 16:43.680
MOLLY:
Colonel Solomon?

16:43.710 --> 16:45.390
Are you Colonel Solomon?

16:46.330 --> 16:48.340
Who's asking?

16:48.370 --> 16:50.200
My name's Molly Al Fayeed.

16:50.230 --> 16:54.070
Another Al Fayeed?
(chuckles)

16:55.940 --> 16:59.570
I'm here
to make a deal with you.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.280
What's that?

17:01.310 --> 17:04.280
It's a wire transfer
for $10 million,

17:04.310 --> 17:06.950
deposited into any account
of your choosing,

17:06.980 --> 17:08.619
provided you and your men
move forward

17:08.650 --> 17:09.849
with the attack on Ma'an.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.450
- Is that your own personal money?
- Yes.

17:12.490 --> 17:16.020
You do not look much
like my... usual employers.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.630
The man you know as Khalil,

17:18.660 --> 17:20.589
the leader
of the Red Hand,

17:20.619 --> 17:21.960
that's my husband.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.660
If you don't act now,

17:23.700 --> 17:25.210
if you don't provide him
the support you've promised...

17:25.240 --> 17:26.970
It's not as simple as that.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.670
We do not have a general,
so we do not have an army,

17:29.710 --> 17:32.650
just lots of men with rifles.
And with all due respect, ma'am,

17:32.680 --> 17:34.420
I am not going into battle
under your command.

17:34.450 --> 17:36.480
I'm working on that right now.

17:36.510 --> 17:36.970
Look, as much as I

17:37.010 --> 17:38.180
- would like to take your money,
- My husband is there.

17:38.210 --> 17:39.850
- I am not going...
- I'm just asking you to hold...

17:39.890 --> 17:41.060
(man shouts)

17:49.930 --> 17:52.600
I guess I'm working
for you now.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.310
He wasn't always
like this,

18:08.340 --> 18:10.180
Ihab Rashid.

18:10.180 --> 18:11.960
Before he joined
the Caliphate,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.750
my brother and I
fought with him.

18:13.780 --> 18:17.070
We hid him from
Jamal's soldiers.

18:17.110 --> 18:19.650
Him and his wife Samira.

18:20.790 --> 18:25.040
After the gas attack,
everything changed.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.920
Whatever Ihab is now,

18:26.950 --> 18:30.390
Jamal Al Fayeed
made him that way.

18:30.430 --> 18:33.030
HALIMA:
Khalil, can you hear me?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.030
Go ahead.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.680
The operation is back on.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.210
Copy that. How?

18:42.240 --> 18:45.330
Sammy's mother, somehow she got
General Said released.

18:45.370 --> 18:47.600
He will be there soon with his
military. If you can hold off

18:47.640 --> 18:49.050
the Caliphate...

18:49.080 --> 18:51.980
We'll do what we can. Thank you.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.690
Dad?

18:54.730 --> 18:56.620
- Sammy?
- Yeah.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.280
Marwan, wrap this one more time.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.570
Sammy, you have every right
to be angry with me, but...

19:04.600 --> 19:06.130
I'm glad you're not here.

19:06.170 --> 19:08.300
I'm not angry.

19:08.330 --> 19:11.540
I just don't want to lose you
a second time.

19:11.570 --> 19:14.050
Khalil, you need
to see something.

19:14.090 --> 19:16.370
One second.

19:17.170 --> 19:20.180
I love you, Sammy.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.020
I love you, too.

19:25.050 --> 19:27.480
(sniffles)

19:27.520 --> 19:29.740
Dad...

19:31.020 --> 19:33.520
Dad?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.740
IHAB (over bullhorn):
Khalil!

19:40.770 --> 19:42.100
SIDDIQ:
It's Ihab Rashid.

19:42.130 --> 19:43.400
He's here.

19:43.430 --> 19:45.700
Khalil!

19:45.740 --> 19:48.700
Or whoever you are!

19:48.740 --> 19:51.510
I will trade your life

19:51.550 --> 19:54.910
for the lives
of the rest of your men!

19:54.940 --> 19:58.880
So surrender yourself, Khalil!

19:58.920 --> 20:01.880
I will spare them!

20:01.920 --> 20:04.650
You have one minute!

20:12.760 --> 20:16.580
I just got the message
that the operation is back on.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.780
General Said's on his way.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.450
If I go down there, I may be
able to buy us some time.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.230
- Don't even think about it.
- We need time

20:24.270 --> 20:26.270
- for the general to get here.
- And then what?

20:26.310 --> 20:29.210
All of us, we're
just soldiers.

20:29.650 --> 20:31.610
Marwan is right.

20:31.650 --> 20:34.520
IHAB:
30 seconds!

20:34.560 --> 20:35.060
Look, if God

20:35.090 --> 20:37.990
is willing for us to survive
this, we need a leader.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.320
You'll lead yourselves.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.790
I have faith
in every one of you.

20:44.830 --> 20:45.960
- No. No. No.
- Marwan. Marwan. No!

20:45.990 --> 20:48.290
Marwan! Marwan...
Marwan!

20:48.320 --> 20:49.800
Here I am!

20:49.830 --> 20:52.630
I am Khalil!

20:52.670 --> 20:54.810
Hold your fire!

20:59.710 --> 21:01.170
No! Marwan, no, no!

21:01.200 --> 21:04.140
No. Don't dishonor
his sacrifice. Let him go.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.520
Stop!

21:15.550 --> 21:18.380
Don't move.

21:19.490 --> 21:22.340
I am Khalil.

21:24.060 --> 21:26.330
(soldiers speaking
indistinctly)

21:33.840 --> 21:35.410
(blade clicks into place)

21:47.090 --> 21:50.290
(inhales and exhales deeply)

21:52.090 --> 21:54.390
Khalil.

21:54.430 --> 21:58.310
You said you would spare my men.

22:00.090 --> 22:03.330
You seem a little young
to be the leader of men.

22:03.370 --> 22:07.240
My generation
deserves the chance

22:07.270 --> 22:09.620
to determine its own future.

22:09.660 --> 22:12.920
Not one dictated
by barbarians.

22:12.950 --> 22:14.450
You...

22:14.950 --> 22:19.050
You... killed my wife.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.100
You left her to die alone,

22:30.130 --> 22:32.130
bleeding on a floor.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.930
And you call me
a barbarian. Hmm?

22:35.970 --> 22:37.070
No, no, no. No, no.

22:37.110 --> 22:39.570
No, you look at me.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.620
I want you
to look me in the eyes

22:41.650 --> 22:43.270
when I slit your throat.

22:43.310 --> 22:44.770
Before your wife died...

22:44.810 --> 22:48.740
she said some things.

22:48.780 --> 22:53.970
Or maybe you'd rather cut my
throat than hear what she said.

22:57.290 --> 22:59.620
Tell me.

22:59.650 --> 23:01.860
She asked...

23:01.890 --> 23:06.530
she begged... for
God to forgive you

23:06.560 --> 23:09.100
for what you've done.

23:09.130 --> 23:10.840
No. No.

23:10.870 --> 23:12.770
She said that you
were once good,

23:12.800 --> 23:15.670
but that the world
had poisoned you.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.740
She said that you
were infected now.

23:18.770 --> 23:21.260
That you were not
liberating the people,

23:21.290 --> 23:23.610
you were destroying them.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.080
- No.
- Yeah.

23:26.110 --> 23:29.420
Samira knew...

23:29.450 --> 23:33.790
she knew better than me
what's needed to be done...

23:33.820 --> 23:36.690
and so I know that you...

23:36.720 --> 23:39.660
that you are lying.

23:40.890 --> 23:45.540
You... are not... Khalil.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.630
We are all Khalil.

23:48.670 --> 23:51.140
(yelling)

23:56.170 --> 23:59.740
- (grunting)
- (screaming)

23:59.780 --> 24:02.270
Khalil!

24:02.300 --> 24:04.480
Are you such
a coward, Khalil?!

24:04.520 --> 24:06.920
Sending a boy
to do your job?!

24:06.950 --> 24:09.790
(Marwan screams)

24:12.120 --> 24:13.590
(Marwan panting)

24:13.620 --> 24:15.390
- (screams)
- This is Khalil?

24:15.420 --> 24:17.760
(Marwan gasping)

24:17.800 --> 24:19.260
No.

24:19.300 --> 24:21.810
No, but-but
he is up there,

24:21.840 --> 24:24.590
and he will come to me.
Khalil!

24:24.630 --> 24:26.950
Come down, or,
I swear to God,

24:26.980 --> 24:29.650
I will cut this boy
into little pieces!

24:29.690 --> 24:31.300
Khalil!

24:31.940 --> 24:33.950
(yelling)

24:33.980 --> 24:36.510
I told you to leave this alone.

24:36.550 --> 24:39.550
- Take him away.
- (panting)

24:39.580 --> 24:41.280
(men shouting)

24:49.920 --> 24:51.960
You were right, Siddiq.

24:53.430 --> 24:57.350
We will not dishonor
his sacrifice.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.070
- I'm sorry,
- (distant gunfire)

25:08.100 --> 25:09.750
Abu Omar.

25:09.790 --> 25:12.790
I overstepped
my bounds.

25:12.820 --> 25:15.190
Yes, you did.

25:15.230 --> 25:18.300
I should have
consulted you first.

25:18.330 --> 25:22.470
And, uh, I won't make
the same mistake again.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.340
No, you won't.

25:30.510 --> 25:35.480
Have you forgotten
that you came to me, hmm?

25:35.510 --> 25:39.320
You enlisted me
to front for the Caliphate.

25:39.350 --> 25:42.820
You need me, because I am
from Abuddin... you are not.

25:42.850 --> 25:45.690
Naga, you know
I'm right.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
- Come.
- What are you doing?

25:54.400 --> 25:57.270
Abu... Abu Omar. Abu Omar!

26:07.560 --> 26:12.340
Many of our fighters are loyal
to him, especially from Ma'an.

26:12.370 --> 26:14.020
Don't worry, Commander.
I will release him

26:14.050 --> 26:17.320
when he remembers
who is in charge.

26:17.350 --> 26:20.860
(gunfire, shouting)

26:38.570 --> 26:42.680
There's 20 more of them
flanking us on the right!

26:43.910 --> 26:45.780
We have to fall back!

26:45.810 --> 26:47.720
Cover me!

26:47.750 --> 26:50.250
(gunfire)

26:51.090 --> 26:53.150
Come on!

26:54.090 --> 26:56.660
(grunting)

27:03.270 --> 27:06.540
Khalil, I need you here. They're
coming up the east flank.

27:36.360 --> 27:39.630
(gunfire distorts, quiets)

27:39.660 --> 27:43.630
(panting)

27:45.640 --> 27:48.140
(heart beating)

27:56.210 --> 27:58.880
(helicopter blades whirring
slowly, then normal speed)

28:02.490 --> 28:04.150
(gunfire blasting)

28:06.360 --> 28:08.460
(helicopter blades whirring,
gunfire blasting)

28:25.980 --> 28:29.150
- Naga, come, now!
- Go!

28:50.600 --> 28:51.510
Move out!

28:51.550 --> 28:52.980
Have your men secure
the landing strip.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.520
We have three
C-130s coming in.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.870
Let's go!
Let's go!

28:55.910 --> 28:57.210
Come on, come on!

29:03.310 --> 29:05.500
Forward!
Forward!

29:08.150 --> 29:09.480
(commander shouting)

29:18.760 --> 29:20.030
(explosion thunders)

29:25.800 --> 29:27.770
Let's go.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.340
- (explosions thundering)
- Now!

29:29.370 --> 29:31.840
Abu Omar! Abu Omar!

29:31.870 --> 29:34.970
Abu Omar!

29:36.280 --> 29:37.980
Send reinforcements
to the oil fields.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.980
That's their next target.

29:40.470 --> 29:41.850
Go to the
oil field now.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.330
Help! Help!

29:44.360 --> 29:47.320
No, no, no, no, no! No!

29:53.700 --> 29:55.640
You were right.

29:56.180 --> 30:00.910
I spent too much of my life
enabling your father,

30:01.350 --> 30:04.100
standing by his side,
even when I knew he was wrong...

30:04.130 --> 30:05.280
Are you asking for my sympathy?

30:05.320 --> 30:07.160
- No, I didn't...
- Look around.

30:07.190 --> 30:10.360
Look at what you bought
with that silence.

30:11.600 --> 30:16.030
Who could ever sympathize
with you?

30:17.200 --> 30:20.870
Someone who could see
inside my heart.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.370
So you're right.

30:24.410 --> 30:26.540
No one.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.510
Okay, then.

30:30.550 --> 30:33.850
I don't want
anyone's sympathy.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.630
I want to make
things right, Ahmed.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.550
I've left your father.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.480
- What?
- He can't know that now.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.890
That would be too dangerous.
But...

30:45.930 --> 30:47.900
it's over.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.520
Those are just words, Mother.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.180
I freed Rami.
I let him out

30:51.210 --> 30:54.750
of prison, gave him an army
to fight alongside Bassam.

30:55.140 --> 30:57.110
I committed treason.

30:57.140 --> 30:59.910
There's no going back.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.510
(sighs)

31:03.550 --> 31:05.700
Mother...

31:05.740 --> 31:08.950
I didn't do it for me.

31:10.450 --> 31:13.020
I don't know
what will happen to us.

31:13.060 --> 31:15.760
I don't know if God
is still by our side,

31:15.790 --> 31:17.760
but if He is,

31:17.790 --> 31:21.080
if we prevail,
none of this will mean anything

31:21.110 --> 31:23.690
if you walk away
from this place.

31:26.940 --> 31:30.150
You woke me up, Ahmed.

31:30.190 --> 31:32.410
My beautiful son.

31:33.810 --> 31:37.880
Put aside your anger
and let me do the same for you.

31:43.150 --> 31:45.250
We've secured the base.

31:45.290 --> 31:48.520
I have Solomon moving our troops
towards the oil fields.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.010
With their air defenses down,

31:50.050 --> 31:51.390
we'll have
the aerial bombardment

31:51.430 --> 31:53.450
start this nightfall.

31:55.050 --> 31:57.690
I came here
with 40 men and women,

31:57.730 --> 31:59.960
and there are four of us left.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.700
Barely feels like a victory.

32:03.740 --> 32:06.290
I'm sorry.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.860
I'm gonna go help with triage.

32:09.890 --> 32:11.690
Try and be a doctor again.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.400
And I'd like to see my son
and talk to my wife.

32:14.430 --> 32:15.520
Right.

32:15.550 --> 32:17.060
I'll take the war from here.

32:17.090 --> 32:20.350
(wry laugh)
Okay.

32:20.390 --> 32:23.290
- MAN: To our country!
- MAN 2: Hey!

32:34.230 --> 32:37.470
<i>(ringtone playing)</i>

32:38.810 --> 32:41.900
Hello? Hello?

32:41.930 --> 32:43.310
BARRY:
Molly.

32:44.810 --> 32:46.780
Barry.

32:46.810 --> 32:49.880
Is that really you?

32:49.920 --> 32:52.550
It's really me.

32:53.620 --> 32:56.520
(crying)

32:56.560 --> 33:00.230
Molly?

33:00.260 --> 33:02.490
Oh, God,
just keep talking, okay?

33:02.530 --> 33:04.660
I just want to hear your voice.

33:04.700 --> 33:08.970
I'm alive, and it's over,
and you did it.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.940
You saved my life, the day...

33:11.980 --> 33:13.390
maybe even this country.

33:13.430 --> 33:16.370
(laughs)

33:16.410 --> 33:18.980
I'll settle for you.

33:19.010 --> 33:22.220
(Molly's breath quivers,
Barry sighs)

33:22.260 --> 33:24.650
Have you talked to Sammy?

33:24.650 --> 33:27.990
Yeah. We've been on the phone
practically this whole time.

33:27.990 --> 33:29.390
He wouldn't hang up.

33:29.420 --> 33:31.020
Okay. I'm gonna call him next.

33:31.060 --> 33:33.690
I want him to come and help me
set up a field hospital.

33:33.730 --> 33:35.960
Away from the fighting?

33:35.990 --> 33:36.910
Far away.

33:36.950 --> 33:38.060
(Molly sighs)

33:38.100 --> 33:41.230
No more war for me.

33:41.270 --> 33:43.670
I can meet you there
if you want. I can help.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.570
I'm gonna send
the stable patients

33:45.600 --> 33:47.460
back to the hospital in Asima,

33:47.490 --> 33:49.590
but they'll need doctors there.

33:50.580 --> 33:52.040
Of course.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.360
Just promise me
you'll stay safe, okay?

33:55.390 --> 33:56.510
You and Sammy?

33:56.550 --> 33:59.030
I promise.

34:00.350 --> 34:03.190
I want to see you so much.

34:04.490 --> 34:07.190
Me, too.

34:10.530 --> 34:13.000
Okay, I'm gonna go.

34:13.030 --> 34:15.090
I love you.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.469
I'll call you again soon.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.840
Okay.

34:18.870 --> 34:21.840
Really soon, okay?

34:22.210 --> 34:23.929
I love you.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.389
I love you.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.719
(laughing)

34:38.659 --> 34:41.219
Okay, I'll see you there.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.530
He just sat down
with General Said.

34:51.570 --> 34:53.500
They're making plans
to move into Ma'an

34:53.540 --> 34:55.139
to take back the city.

34:55.170 --> 34:57.840
I can't believe this.

34:57.870 --> 34:59.410
He did it.

34:59.440 --> 35:00.940
- Yeah...
- We did it.

35:00.980 --> 35:03.380
- How did he sound?
- He sounded good.

35:03.420 --> 35:05.290
He sounded... strong.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.410
And he's not hurt?

35:06.450 --> 35:08.580
No. I don't think so.

35:08.620 --> 35:11.590
He's sending a helicopter
for me to come join him.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.340
That's good.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.220
That's so good.

35:14.220 --> 35:15.390
I told you.

35:18.560 --> 35:21.820
Your father just takes time
to grow into things.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.630
Yeah.

35:26.670 --> 35:28.700
- Yeah.
- I'm going home.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.770
And see my sisters.

35:30.810 --> 35:33.770
You can finally go back
to Tal Jiza and find Ghani.

35:33.810 --> 35:36.780
Yes. Who knows how big he'll be.

35:36.810 --> 35:39.610
I can't wait to see my mother's
face when my father and I both

35:39.650 --> 35:42.430
walk into the room
at the same time.

35:46.890 --> 35:49.790
Yes, how wonderful.

35:49.820 --> 35:54.530
In our estimation,
we-we have the resources

35:54.560 --> 35:57.220
to withstand a Caliphate siege
of Asima for

35:57.260 --> 35:58.980
two weeks,
three at most.

35:59.010 --> 36:00.200
(sighs heavily)

36:00.330 --> 36:02.460
Of course, if the Chinese

36:02.490 --> 36:05.030
government responds to
our latest request for aid,

36:05.060 --> 36:06.320
those numbers change.

36:06.350 --> 36:09.640
Ah. You are playing defense.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.740
However, we need
a battle plan

36:12.770 --> 36:16.270
that turns the Caliphate
attack on Asima

36:16.310 --> 36:19.010
into their Waterloo.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.190
No, no, no, no, no.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.420
Don't look at Mahmoud

36:24.460 --> 36:26.940
for answers, look at me.

36:31.260 --> 36:32.760
I'm sorry.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.570
I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.600
What do you want now?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.690
(sighs)

36:46.450 --> 36:48.580
We have news, Jamal.

36:48.610 --> 36:50.080
Good news.

36:50.120 --> 36:53.100
What game
do you want to play now?

36:53.130 --> 36:53.690
Leave me.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.670
I have no...
no time for this.

36:56.710 --> 36:59.120
Molly wasn't lying,
earlier.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.050
You didn't kill your brother.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.490
Oh, stop it.

37:02.530 --> 37:04.390
I'm investigating that.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.470
In any case, I don't want
to go through this again.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.190
Providence was on your side
all along, Jamal.

37:09.230 --> 37:10.210
Oh, really?

37:10.250 --> 37:12.140
Then why God would punish us

37:12.170 --> 37:13.800
for something I didn't do?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.980
No, you weren't being punished.

37:16.020 --> 37:18.910
Look around, Leila.

37:18.940 --> 37:21.540
Everything is devastation.

37:21.570 --> 37:24.080
What would
you call it?

37:24.120 --> 37:27.940
Why is everyone
plotting, lying...

37:27.970 --> 37:30.100
No one was plotting.

37:33.220 --> 37:36.120
No one was lying.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.140
Show him.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.130
Bassam left this
for Sammy and Molly.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.400
Before the battle.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.700
BARRY:
Once I joined the resistance,

37:46.730 --> 37:50.500
I knew that
I couldn't be Khalil forever.

37:50.540 --> 37:52.970
That... sooner or later,
I'd have to reveal

37:53.010 --> 37:55.540
that Bassam Al Fayeed
was still alive.

37:55.580 --> 37:58.210
LEILA:
You spared him, Jamal.

37:58.250 --> 38:01.250
You have nothing
to feel guilty for.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.360
But the guilt
that you hadn't

38:04.400 --> 38:06.470
made you paranoid.

38:06.510 --> 38:08.590
It blinded you

38:08.620 --> 38:12.260
and turned you
against your own family.

38:12.300 --> 38:15.830
Rami didn't kill your mother.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.800
The Caliphate did.

38:22.740 --> 38:26.300
I freed Rami; I set him free.

38:27.410 --> 38:29.040
You did what?

38:29.080 --> 38:31.010
So he could save your brother.

38:31.050 --> 38:33.210
AHMED:
He raised an army, Father.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.180
Solomon's army.

38:35.220 --> 38:36.820
And right now,
with Bassam,

38:36.850 --> 38:39.180
they're beating back
the Caliphate.

38:39.210 --> 38:41.260
We're on the offensive.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.690
They're fighting
for you.

38:42.730 --> 38:44.530
You've been blessed,

38:44.560 --> 38:46.390
not punished.

38:46.430 --> 38:49.120
It was God's will
that you save Bassam,

38:49.160 --> 38:50.930
so you can save us all.

38:50.970 --> 38:52.730
(phone beeps)

38:52.770 --> 38:55.040
BARRY: Because the fact
that my life was spared

38:55.070 --> 38:56.720
has to mean something.

38:56.750 --> 38:59.470
I have to make it
mean something.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.880
I don't want to die,

39:02.910 --> 39:05.180
but if I do,

39:05.220 --> 39:08.960
it'll be in the cause of freedom

39:08.990 --> 39:10.410
and religious tolerance

39:10.440 --> 39:13.090
and for the love of my country.

39:14.390 --> 39:16.520
Because this is my country.

39:16.560 --> 39:20.030
The place where I was born.

39:22.130 --> 39:23.940
That was good.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.370
You were good, son.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.770
So what happens now?

39:27.800 --> 39:29.600
The only way
to preserve your place

39:29.640 --> 39:33.150
in the future of Abuddin
is sacrifice your father's.

39:33.180 --> 39:34.240
How?

39:34.280 --> 39:36.830
I'm working on it.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.710
You'll know
when you need to know.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.990
Until then,

39:42.030 --> 39:43.590
just keep pretending
everything is normal.

39:43.630 --> 39:45.400
Can you do that?

39:45.440 --> 39:46.960
I've been pretending
everything is normal

39:47.000 --> 39:49.070
my entire life.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.360
(people talking,
man groaning in distance)

39:56.400 --> 39:59.400
Get me another pad.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.100
No, no, in the box.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.540
- Yeah...
- (man sobbing)

40:06.640 --> 40:08.010
Here.

40:09.310 --> 40:11.140
Could've been you
lying here.

40:11.180 --> 40:14.150
I'm just glad it's not you.

40:16.180 --> 40:19.020
I saw Siddiq on my way in.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.650
Seems like he's doing okay.

40:21.690 --> 40:24.250
Uh... what about Marwan?

40:25.860 --> 40:27.730
We lost almost everyone.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.260
MEDIC:
We found someone.

40:30.260 --> 40:31.910
In a collapsed brig.

40:31.950 --> 40:33.970
Must be a Caliphate prisoner.

40:35.220 --> 40:36.130
Okay.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.690
(man groaning in pain)

40:38.720 --> 40:40.590
Left arm severed
at the elbow.

40:40.620 --> 40:42.460
Blunt trauma to the chest
and abdomen.

40:42.490 --> 40:43.690
Shrapnel blinded him.

40:43.730 --> 40:45.190
(screams)

40:45.220 --> 40:47.200
No! No, don't touch me!

40:47.240 --> 40:50.740
No! Don't touch me,
just leave me alone.

40:50.770 --> 40:51.870
(groaning):
Let me...

40:51.900 --> 40:53.130
please just let me die.

40:53.170 --> 40:54.900
(Ihab sobbing)

40:57.140 --> 40:58.990
Sammy, hold this tourniquet.

40:59.020 --> 41:00.460
- Dad, that's not just some prisoner.
- Sammy...

41:00.490 --> 41:01.260
Do you know who that is?

41:01.260 --> 41:02.590
I know who it is.

41:02.630 --> 41:04.100
Then what are
you doing?

41:04.140 --> 41:05.860
Dad, he's responsible
for all of this.

41:05.890 --> 41:07.140
He k... he killed...

41:07.170 --> 41:09.250
He killed my friends, too.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.720
Hold the tourniquet.

41:11.750 --> 41:13.300
- No. Let him die.
- Sammy...

41:13.330 --> 41:14.620
- Let him... No!
- Sammy!
