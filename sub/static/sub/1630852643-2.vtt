WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.020
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.449
Ready? One…

01:14.533 --> 01:16.910
-Two, three.
-…two, three.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.920
Lunch break.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.048
What a waste of time.
We could be building.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.844
I'm secretly hammering with my other hand.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.143
This is so exciting, Architect.

01:41.226 --> 01:45.814
More water means more power,
which means bigger buildings.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.858
What a time to be a Doozer!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.318
Cotterpin.

01:49.401 --> 01:54.239
Your latest Doozer tower creation must be,
well, a thousand Doozers tall.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.533
More like a hundred, sir.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.243
I know.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.705
I'm just proud of you.
Let me be proud of you.

02:01.788 --> 02:06.043
I just hope the Fraggles enjoy eating it
as much as we enjoyed building it.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.127
Yes.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.506
These are so good!

02:10.589 --> 02:13.509
If only I had two mouths
so I could eat two at once.

02:14.176 --> 02:18.138
Wait. Nobody eat that Doozer tower.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.474
-We won't.
-Hey, Red. What's going on?

02:20.557 --> 02:23.560
You're vibrating with energy.
Let it out, sister Fraggle!

02:23.644 --> 02:27.689
I know Doozer structures are delicious.
We eat them. The Doozers rebuild them.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.025
-The perfect cycle.
-Yeah, yeah, totally.

02:30.108 --> 02:35.197
But that tower would be perfect
for an awesome diving game!

02:36.740 --> 02:39.660
Yeah, right.
If you wanna break your baloobius.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.370
Come on, Boober.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.706
All this new water.
All these new buildings.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.918
What a time to be a Fraggle!

02:48.502 --> 02:49.503
Yes!

02:51.088 --> 02:53.257
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip…

02:53.340 --> 02:56.009
Hooray!
We're gonna dance and sing all day

02:56.093 --> 02:58.053
We're number one
And we've just begun

02:58.136 --> 02:59.972
And now it's time to play

03:03.433 --> 03:06.854
Hip, hip, hooray
Let's shout for you and me

03:06.937 --> 03:08.897
We do our best to meet the test

03:08.981 --> 03:10.566
And now it's time for tea

03:12.359 --> 03:13.944
Hip, hip, hooray!

03:21.869 --> 03:25.581
Hip, hip, hooray
We're gonna dance and sing all day

03:25.664 --> 03:27.583
We're number one
We've just begun

03:27.666 --> 03:31.044
And now it's time to play
And now it's time to play

03:31.128 --> 03:33.839
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray

03:37.384 --> 03:40.095
Red, so, what's this amazing
new diving game?

03:40.179 --> 03:41.388
It's called…

03:41.471 --> 03:43.307
Wait, where's Gobo?

03:43.390 --> 03:46.018
"Wait, where's Gobo?" Great name.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.103
No, really. Where is Gobo?

03:48.187 --> 03:51.440
I forgot.
He went up to the hole to Outer Space

03:51.523 --> 03:54.234
to get the first artifact
from his Uncle Travelling Matt.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.529
How brave, how meaningful, how courageous.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.657
How long is he gonna be?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.994
What? I'm excited to play.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.339
Okay, Gobo. You got this.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.052
You're brave.
You're quick. You look cute in a hat.

04:20.135 --> 04:24.181
All you gotta do is run in there
and grab the package from Uncle Matt

04:24.264 --> 04:25.641
and head back home.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.935
Nothing to be afraid of.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.147
Sprocket!

04:36.443 --> 04:40.197
Yeah, yeah. Laugh on, my friend,
but my flippers look good.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.867
And fish have a very strict dress code
when you go to their house.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.872
It may just look like water, but
you never know what you're gonna find.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.751
Speaking of… He must have snuck in.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.002
Poor little guy.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.172
Sprocket. You gotta respect his space.

04:57.923 --> 04:58.966
Hello, friend.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.302
Welcome. You're a cute little guy.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.681
We're gonna take you
back to the beach soon.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.267
But in the meantime,
make yourself at home.

05:10.269 --> 05:13.313
One house rule.
You pinch me, and I'll pinch you back.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.985
I hope it's my new
Ocean Sciences textbook.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.448
Wait. Who's "Gobo Fraggle"?

05:24.783 --> 05:28.328
I guess that's who lived here before me.
I'll put this with my other returns.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.498
That's my cue.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.425
Got it.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.804
Fraggle feet, don't fail me now.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.472
Sprocket, what are you barking at?

05:49.183 --> 05:50.642
Sprocket! Sprocket, what happened?

05:50.726 --> 05:52.561
What's wrong? Sprocket.

05:54.438 --> 05:58.400
I can't wait for Gobo anymore.
Too excited!

05:59.234 --> 06:01.278
-Let's just play the game, okay?
-Sure.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.199
So, we're gonna use that awesome
new Doozer structure to play--

06:05.282 --> 06:07.951
-Hey, guys. I got the first artifact.
-You're amazing.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.370
-Look, there's a note from Uncle Matt.
-Yeah.

06:10.454 --> 06:14.833
-Beautiful penmanship.
-Come on!

06:14.917 --> 06:17.836
Sorry, Red.
Well, I'll just read it real quick.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.131
There's nothing quick
about your Uncle Matt.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.842
"Dear Nephew Gobo…"

06:23.926 --> 06:27.513
My exciting journey
back into Outer Space has begun,

06:27.596 --> 06:29.598
and I have never felt more welcome.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.974
No!

06:31.058 --> 06:33.810
It seems the Silly Creature
welcoming committee

06:33.894 --> 06:35.687
has been leaving me gifts.

06:36.855 --> 06:40.025
Thank you, Silly Creatures.
You really shouldn't have.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.903
With so many wonderful gifts
to choose from,

06:42.986 --> 06:46.365
I wanted to ensure that
the first artifact I sent back

06:46.448 --> 06:48.909
was truly valuable and uplifting.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.453
I-- What?

06:51.537 --> 06:52.829
What is this?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.958
"…a squishy crystal cloak.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.419
It's one of the Silly Creatures'
most prized artifacts of all.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.296
Love, your Uncle Travelling Matt."

07:04.550 --> 07:06.176
What is this?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.804
Now we have a prize for the game.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.348
The winner gets the cloak.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.143
-Yeah.
-For what game? Thanks for asking.

07:15.227 --> 07:20.357
We are going to play
Floop! Bloop! And Whoop!

07:20.440 --> 07:21.775
Sounds fun, Red.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.111
Tell us how to play
Floop! Bloop! And Whoop!

07:24.194 --> 07:26.363
-Yeah.
-I can't tell you, Wembley.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.700
But I can show you!

07:29.783 --> 07:30.784
Hit it!

07:37.457 --> 07:40.169
-First you floop.
-First you floop.

07:43.088 --> 07:46.008
-And then you bloop.
-And then you bloop!

07:49.136 --> 07:50.429
And last but not least…

07:50.512 --> 07:52.014
And last but not least…

07:54.892 --> 07:56.351
-You whoop!
-You whoop!

07:56.435 --> 07:57.561
-You whoop!
-You whoop!

07:57.644 --> 07:58.812
I said, you whoop!

08:01.064 --> 08:03.358
Floop, bloop and whoop!
Floop, bloop and whoop!

08:03.442 --> 08:05.110
Floop, bloop and whoop!

08:05.194 --> 08:07.738
Floop, bloop and whoop!
Floop, bloop and whoop!

08:07.821 --> 08:10.449
Floop, bloop and whoop!
Floop, bloop and whoop!

08:11.074 --> 08:12.075
Floop, bloop, whoop!

08:14.870 --> 08:18.457
Okay. Gobo and me are team captains.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.666
Let's hit it!

08:20.667 --> 08:22.503
You're on, Red Fraggle.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.506
Can someone explain what we're doing?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.007
Preferably in song?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.300
I'm a musical learner.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.220
I'm ready. For sure.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.517
-Yeah. I'm really excited.
-I can't believe I'm on your team, Red.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.520
I'm gonna bloop bigger than
any Fraggle's ever blooped before!

08:39.602 --> 08:42.022
All right, you ready team? Here we go!

08:42.105 --> 08:44.274
-Let the games begi--
-Excuse me, Red.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.778
Sorry to interrupt,
but as the referee/medic/lifeguard,

08:47.861 --> 08:50.280
we have to go over
the rules and safety regulations.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.242
This won't take but a moment.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.539
Okay. There are 800 rules.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.667
Rule number one:
All the rules must be read twice.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.795
Rule number one:
All the rules must be read twice.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.382
Rule number 800, part D:

09:08.465 --> 09:11.760
If there are no seashells available,
acorns will do.

09:11.844 --> 09:16.098
Thank you. That concludes the rules.
I told you it'd be quick.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.392
Now, let's begin the Q and A.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.811
-No! Game time! Now.
-What?

09:22.729 --> 09:23.564
Oh, boy.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.485
First you floop!

09:31.947 --> 09:33.532
Yeah!

09:33.615 --> 09:34.658
Then you bloop!

09:39.538 --> 09:40.706
Be the bloop.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.340
And last but not least, you whoop

09:50.424 --> 09:51.884
Here goes nothin'.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.390
It'll do.

09:58.891 --> 09:59.725
Okay.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.727
-I did good.
-Red's team's turn.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.315
Come on, Wembley. You too, Pogey.

10:08.650 --> 10:13.238
Wow, Mokey!
That was a great bloop! Was it fun?

10:14.531 --> 10:17.117
That tower is so much higher
than it looks, Wembley.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.661
-I looked off that cliff…
-Yeah?

10:19.745 --> 10:23.665
…and the wind howled,
and I dove straight into the abyss.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.670
And it was awesome!

10:29.880 --> 10:32.216
Mokey, I-- What?

10:33.258 --> 10:36.261
Did she say it's higher than it looks?

10:36.345 --> 10:38.639
Come on, Wembley. It's our turn.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.599
We are gonna win this!

10:40.682 --> 10:42.434
-Come on. Here we go.
-Red, wait. Hold on.

10:42.518 --> 10:43.602
Wait.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.447
I love jumping in
from the side of the pond, but…

10:56.114 --> 10:58.283
this is a lot higher
than I thought it was gonna be.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.410
I know. It's awesome, right?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.045
Okay. You can do this, Wembley.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.173
It's just incredibly high.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.052
And scary.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.012
And then you bloop!

11:19.763 --> 11:22.349
Well, this is not covered by the rules.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.686
And then you bloop!

11:25.769 --> 11:28.564
Come on, Wembley. It's your turn to bloop.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.316
I-- Okay. Okay, I'm gonna do it.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.151
-Good, then--
-Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.361
Then you bloop.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.113
-No, you're not. No, you're not.
-What?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.948
Come on, Wembley. You can do it.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.074
Go, Wembley!

11:39.825 --> 11:41.368
You're so high up!

11:42.411 --> 11:45.247
Red, I really don't wanna do this.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.333
Come on. Everyone else did.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.586
-It's just floop, bloop and whoop.
-I don't care what it's called--

11:50.669 --> 11:52.546
-Wembley, we have to win.
-Bloop, bloop, bloop!

11:52.629 --> 11:54.464
Come on. It's fine.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.675
-Bloop, bloop, bloop!
-No, what are you doing?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.225
No. Is he okay?

12:05.976 --> 12:09.771
Wembley? Wembley? No.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.899
He's frozen.

12:14.443 --> 12:18.822
Rule number 247,
all frozen players must preregister.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.909
You see, this is why
we needed the Q and A.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.958
There, you feel better?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.170
And for the record, you're not injured.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.047
But I know you love Band-Aids.

12:37.341 --> 12:40.219
Hey, don't blame the crab.
The crab's crabulous.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.512
And besides, I told you,

12:41.595 --> 12:44.014
he needs his space,
and you need to respect that.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.976
All right. Now I gotta return
the Gobo Fraggle package.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.145
Wait, where's the Gobo Fraggle package?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.774
Sprocket,
did you move the Gobo Fraggle package?

12:54.900 --> 12:58.070
Why do I keep saying Gobo Fraggle package?
Cause it's fun.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.072
Maybe I left it outside?

13:00.948 --> 13:03.450
Gobo Fraggle package
Gobo Fraggle, Gobo Fraggle

13:03.534 --> 13:05.536
Gobo Fraggle package
Gobo Fraggle

13:14.503 --> 13:16.421
Why isn't he blooping?

13:16.505 --> 13:20.092
-Come on.
-Is this part of the game? I dozed off.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.302
He wanted to be on my team.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.138
Wembley, just jump and we can win!

13:25.222 --> 13:26.890
Can you hear me?

13:26.974 --> 13:29.393
Stay completely still if you can.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.522
Red, he's frozen with fear.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.108
There's literally an icicle on his nose.

13:36.859 --> 13:37.901
Time to whoop?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.319
Not now, Pogey.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.154
Okay.

13:44.116 --> 13:47.911
As the official
medic/lifeguard/slash enthusiast,

13:47.995 --> 13:51.123
I assure you there is no need
to worry/fear.

13:51.206 --> 13:54.459
He's just frozen.
Stinkleberries will do the trick.

13:54.543 --> 13:58.797
They grow by the Trash Heap and smell
so bad the stink will unfreeze him.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.007
Perfect!

14:00.090 --> 14:03.051
I'll get the stinkleberries,
unfreeze Wembley, and he'll jump.

14:03.135 --> 14:04.219
You'll see.

14:08.807 --> 14:13.854
I'm twirling, I'm stomping
I'm twirling, I'm stomping

14:13.937 --> 14:15.939
Twirl, twirl, twirl
Stomp and twirl

14:16.023 --> 14:18.358
Stomp and twirl all day

14:19.526 --> 14:21.069
Yeah. Stomping and twirling...

14:21.153 --> 14:24.698
I just have to get through the garden
to the stinkleberries

14:24.781 --> 14:27.451
without getting thumped by a Gorg.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.994
Sure, okay.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.247
Junior!

14:32.331 --> 14:34.041
Thump that Fraggle!

14:34.124 --> 14:35.167
On it, Pa.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.295
I'm dizzy. I'm stomping.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.379
There it is, Junior.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.548
-Right there by your foot.
-By my foot?

14:41.632 --> 14:43.926
I'm pointing right at it, Junior.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.970
-Sorry, Pa. I'm too dizzy!
-Son.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.514
Here's a good one, boys.

14:48.597 --> 14:49.640
-Okay.
-Goody, goody.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.975
-"Roses are red, violets are blue.
-Yeah.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.060
Yeah.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.313
Nothing is worse than gum on your shoe."

14:57.356 --> 14:59.149
-How profound.
-I love it.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.026
High-class garbage that is, Marjory.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.695
-It's so good.
-We got company.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.406
You are in the presence of…

15:06.490 --> 15:08.367
The all-knowing…

15:08.450 --> 15:09.952
Trash Heap.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.956
Hello, little Fraggle.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.250
What sort of advice do you need?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.793
Hello, Madame Heap.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.503
I'm just here for the--

15:23.423 --> 15:25.217
Stinkleberries.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.302
What do you need with stinkleberries?

15:27.386 --> 15:29.805
I'm trash and even I can tell they stink.

15:29.888 --> 15:30.639
Hello.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.809
Yeah, well...

15:33.892 --> 15:36.478
we were playing Floop!
Bloop! And Whoop, and I--

15:36.562 --> 15:38.272
I love that game!

15:38.355 --> 15:42.192
You know, I was quite the blooper
in my time, boys.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.528
-Well, I should say so.
-Indubitably.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.947
Anyway, my friend froze!

15:48.407 --> 15:50.993
So, I'm gonna use these stinkleberries

15:51.076 --> 15:53.871
to unfreeze him
so we can win the game. Bye!

15:53.954 --> 15:55.455
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.583
Now, does your friend want to jump,

15:57.666 --> 16:00.460
or is it just something
that you want him to do?

16:00.544 --> 16:01.795
-Yeah.
-Great point.

16:01.879 --> 16:05.299
Well, of course, he does. Why wouldn't he?

16:05.382 --> 16:09.595
Well this reminds me of a poem
I was just reading to the boys.

16:09.678 --> 16:10.679
Yeah.

16:10.762 --> 16:14.349
"Yes means yes. No means no.

16:14.433 --> 16:18.061
If it's not a big yes,
then that's a no-go."

16:19.563 --> 16:22.232
Marjory, you weren't telling us that poem.

16:22.316 --> 16:26.653
It's called improvisation, boys.
"Yes, and…"

16:26.737 --> 16:28.822
Work with me, I'm doing something.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.866
Listen. Thank you for the poem,

16:30.949 --> 16:33.994
but I really gotta get back
to the game. Bye!

16:34.077 --> 16:36.455
All right. Goodbye, little Fraggle.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.416
-And you remember that poem!
-Yeah.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.793
The Trash Heap has spoken.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.298
She does poetry, she does improv.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.801
Yes, and she also can bloop.
A triple threat.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.263
-Stop it, boys. You're hilarious.
-Yeah.

16:53.347 --> 16:56.016
-There's nothing you can't do, Marjory.
-You're making me blush!

16:56.600 --> 16:58.227
Any update, Boober?

16:58.310 --> 16:59.311
Yep.

17:00.646 --> 17:01.855
Still frozen.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.943
I'm a little concerned
that Wembley's aura's turned green.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.070
-Mokey, he is green.
-Yeah.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.989
Gosh, where is Red anyway?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.242
-Not yet, Pogey.
-Not yet, Pogey.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.119
-Ready when you are!
-Thanks.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.082
I won't miss the Fraggle this time.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.335
I won't miss the Fraggle this time.

17:23.417 --> 17:27.297
I won't miss-- A leaf-shaped leaf.

17:27.381 --> 17:31.176
"Yes means yes, and no means no.

17:32.261 --> 17:35.597
If it's not a big yes, then it's a no-go."

17:37.432 --> 17:39.142
Why did she tell me that?

17:44.773 --> 17:47.025
No! A Gorg!

17:47.109 --> 17:48.569
I did it, Pa!

17:48.652 --> 17:50.404
I caught a Fraggle!

17:50.988 --> 17:54.157
Get rid of it, son!
Throw it down the well!

17:54.241 --> 17:56.410
No, no, no.

17:58.203 --> 18:02.165
No! No, no. No, no, no! I don't want to!

18:02.958 --> 18:04.835
No, I don't want to.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.503
Do it, Junior.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.882
-No!
-Sorry, Fraggle.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.301
No!

18:12.968 --> 18:14.094
No!

18:19.016 --> 18:20.559
That's my boy.

18:33.322 --> 18:36.450
Well, I'll be a Gobo's uncle.
That was awesome!

18:36.533 --> 18:38.410
It wasn't awesome.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.913
It was awful.

18:40.996 --> 18:45.584
But, Red, you've jumped down that well
lots of times before.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.461
Yeah, jumped.

18:47.544 --> 18:52.132
But this time was different.
I didn't have a choice.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.385
I didn't wanna do that.

18:57.888 --> 19:00.599
And neither does Wembley.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.521
-Red.
-Are you okay?

19:05.604 --> 19:06.939
I got your stinkleberries.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.315
Thanks, but…

19:09.024 --> 19:11.318
I don't need them anymore.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.612
That's good 'cause these things stink!

19:14.279 --> 19:16.532
I'm gonna be washing my hands for weeks.

19:17.115 --> 19:20.160
I'm gonna be washing my hands for weeks!
Yes!

19:25.791 --> 19:30.337
Wembley, I should've listened
when you said you didn't wanna jump.

19:30.420 --> 19:35.300
The Trash Heap told me
this great poem that I will never forget.

19:35.384 --> 19:38.262
"Yes means yes. No means--"

19:38.345 --> 19:40.097
I can't remember the rest right now.

19:40.180 --> 19:45.310
But the point is,
you do what you want when you want.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.398
I'm sorry

19:49.481 --> 19:51.108
I didn't see

19:51.608 --> 19:56.989
What it might feel like
To be scared inside

19:58.156 --> 20:03.996
'Cause now I know the way it feels

20:04.079 --> 20:08.292
When no one hears your voice

20:08.375 --> 20:11.420
Like you didn't have a choice

20:12.671 --> 20:15.757
The smallest to the biggest

20:15.841 --> 20:19.052
The softest in the crowd

20:19.136 --> 20:21.388
Each voice important

20:21.471 --> 20:24.391
No matter how it sounds

20:24.474 --> 20:27.311
It's better if we listen

20:27.394 --> 20:30.147
Than try to drown them out

20:30.564 --> 20:35.110
Listen here and now

20:36.528 --> 20:41.241
Listen to the sound

20:41.325 --> 20:43.493
Of every voice

20:48.332 --> 20:50.959
Wembley! You're unfrozen!

20:54.463 --> 20:55.464
Yep.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.425
-Red?
-Yeah?

20:58.509 --> 21:00.719
I really don't wanna jump from up here.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.223
And I am more than okay with that.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.307
Yeah?

21:06.433 --> 21:10.604
Just know there's strength
In what you say

21:10.687 --> 21:13.607
And when you have your doubts

21:13.690 --> 21:17.277
-Just keep remembering
-Remembering

21:17.361 --> 21:20.280
The smallest to the biggest

21:20.364 --> 21:22.366
The softest in the crowd?

21:22.449 --> 21:23.659
Yeah!

21:23.742 --> 21:25.827
Each voice important

21:25.911 --> 21:29.122
No matter how it sounds

21:29.206 --> 21:31.667
It's better if we listen

21:31.750 --> 21:34.670
Than try to drown them out

21:35.212 --> 21:39.925
Listen here and now

21:40.884 --> 21:46.515
Listen to the sound

21:47.015 --> 21:51.436
Listen to the sound of every voice

21:58.318 --> 21:59.736
-Wait!
-What?

21:59.820 --> 22:02.823
I wanna jump
from the lowest part of the tower.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.450
I think that would be perfect!

22:05.534 --> 22:07.578
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Yes!

22:12.082 --> 22:15.127
Then you bloop!

22:21.466 --> 22:23.177
And last but not least...

22:24.386 --> 22:25.762
You whoop!

22:27.306 --> 22:28.640
-Where's Pogey?
-Pogey?

22:28.724 --> 22:30.058
Pogey?

22:30.142 --> 22:32.102
What? No! I'm coming!

22:35.355 --> 22:36.607
Whoop!

22:40.777 --> 22:42.362
And that's the game.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.239
Who won?

22:44.323 --> 22:47.242
There's no rule for this, I--

22:47.910 --> 22:48.911
I'm stumped.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.955
Hey, Gobo. Are you--

22:52.998 --> 22:55.542
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

22:55.626 --> 22:57.961
That I don't wear enough hats? Totally.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.713
I have a ton,
but I never really wear 'em--

22:59.796 --> 23:01.215
What? No! No. Come here.

23:01.298 --> 23:03.634
Give that prize cloak to Wembley.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.261
I was not thinking that, but I love it!

23:09.306 --> 23:13.060
Attention.
As Floop! Bloop! And Whoop team captains,

23:13.143 --> 23:17.940
Gobo and I have unanimously
decided to forfeit the game

23:18.023 --> 23:20.817
because the winner clearly is…

23:20.901 --> 23:21.985
-Wembley!
-Wembley!

23:22.069 --> 23:23.946
What? Me?

23:24.029 --> 23:25.030
-Yeah, buddy.
-Yeah.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.241
You win the squishy crystal cloak!

23:27.324 --> 23:29.201
-That's right. It's all yours.
-Yeah!

23:29.284 --> 23:31.620
Can we hug you?

23:32.204 --> 23:33.121
Yes, please!

23:33.205 --> 23:34.289
-Yeah!
-All right.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.713
We love you, Wembley.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.882
-I love you too.
-Nice flooping, buddy.

23:43.966 --> 23:45.092
I'm real proud of you.

23:47.553 --> 23:48.554
Okay, Sprocket.

23:48.637 --> 23:50.848
I've looked everywhere
for the Gobo Fraggle package,

23:50.931 --> 23:53.350
and I must've dreamt it up
because it's nowhere to be--

23:53.767 --> 23:56.144
Well, hey. Look at you.

23:56.562 --> 23:59.857
See, you gave him the space he needed,
and now you two are friends.

24:00.858 --> 24:02.150
Best friends?

24:02.234 --> 24:04.570
Okay. So this is how I find out.

24:05.362 --> 24:07.281
Time to take him back to the beach.

24:07.364 --> 24:10.200
What, you're sad now?
You've liked him for, like, three minutes.

24:12.494 --> 24:16.039
Hey. Don't ask questions.
I wear this when I go to the beach.

24:16.790 --> 24:17.916
Come on, Sprocket.
