"Previously on" 24.

00:14.408 --> 00:17.032
Tony Almeida from C.T.U.
Has just informed us that...

00:17.128 --> 00:20.169
they were unable to confiscate
this Cordilla virus in Mexico.

00:20.266 --> 00:22.153
This man, Amador, where is he now?

00:22.282 --> 00:27.112
Latest working theory is that Amador has this
virus and is headed back here to Los Angeles.

00:27.241 --> 00:29.033
I let you live.
Tell me what you know.

00:29.128 --> 00:31.465
Anytime Amador does business
on the West Coast...

00:31.561 --> 00:34.185
he washes his deal
through a man named Alvers.

00:34.281 --> 00:38.122
- How does Amador contact Alvers?
- I don't know. I've never met him.

00:38.251 --> 00:41.099
Hello?

00:41.195 --> 00:44.073
Marcus, it's me.
I'll be there in an hour.

00:44.201 --> 00:46.090
- You got the virus?
- Yes.

00:46.185 --> 00:48.746
- Just be ready.
- I will be.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.891
I've gotta go see Julia Milliken.

00:50.987 --> 00:53.451
No. No. I don't want you to go
anywhere near her or Alan tonight.

00:53.579 --> 00:57.003
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Julia, my pills!

00:59.564 --> 01:01.003
- No, don't.
- What are you doing?

01:01.130 --> 01:03.083
- Don't.
- Sherry?

01:03.212 --> 01:07.020
- This is your way out.
- We killed him.

01:07.148 --> 01:09.579
No. But there's one thing you're gonna have
to be really clear about.

01:09.707 --> 01:11.532
When the authorities
come around questioning you...

01:11.627 --> 01:13.996
I was never here.

01:15.852 --> 01:20.108
The following takes place
between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.

01:55.982 --> 01:58.255
- I got her!
- "Agent Bauer."

01:58.351 --> 02:00.239
- "Yeah?"
- I'm Jason Carasone from Division.

02:00.367 --> 02:02.607
These men will be escorting
the prisoner back to C.T.U.

02:02.703 --> 02:07.439
- She doesn't leave my sight.
- I know. You can accompany her
in the lead van. Let's go.

02:10.288 --> 02:15.376
This is Carasone.
Yeah. Yeah, he's right here.

02:15.472 --> 02:18.768
Agent Edmunds,
it's a Chloe O'Brian from your office.

02:18.896 --> 02:21.520
- Hey, Jack, I'll take another car.
- Okay.

02:21.616 --> 02:24.465
- Yeah, Chloe?
- Chase, they found out.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.056
- Who found out what?
- Everybody here found out about Angela.

02:27.185 --> 02:29.808
- They all know she's your daughter.
- What? How?

02:29.904 --> 02:33.873
The babysitter flaked. She had
a family emergency and brought her here.

02:33.968 --> 02:35.985
You brought Angela into C.T.U?

02:36.113 --> 02:38.801
What was I supposed to do? Your sister's
out of town. There is no one else.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.041
You have no idea what I've been through
in the past couple of hours.

02:41.138 --> 02:44.435
Okay, okay, okay. Chloe, thank you
for covering. I appreciate it.

02:44.562 --> 02:48.177
- But where is Angela right now?
- She's downstairs with Marcy until you get back.

02:48.273 --> 02:51.185
Did Kim find out?

02:53.234 --> 02:57.234
- Chloe, did Kim find out?
- Yes. Yes, Kim found out.

02:57.330 --> 03:01.971
- How'd she react?
- Uh, gosh, Chase. I think she's kind of pissed.

03:02.067 --> 03:06.034
All right, listen. I'm coming back to C.T.U.
Right now. I'll take care of everything.

03:06.131 --> 03:08.274
Fine.

03:09.812 --> 03:11.828
Here's the situation.

03:11.956 --> 03:14.995
We believe Michael Amador
is in possession of the Cordilla virus.

03:15.092 --> 03:18.196
We believe he is either headed to
Los Angeles or is here already.

03:18.291 --> 03:23.028
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen
to take out a major metropolitan area.

03:23.155 --> 03:26.932
Our only lead is Nina Myers, who's being
brought back to C.T.U. Right now.

03:27.060 --> 03:30.643
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man
here in Los Angeles...

03:30.740 --> 03:32.372
by the name of Marcus Alvers.

03:32.468 --> 03:34.357
Adam's done a workup on him.

03:34.452 --> 03:38.197
We have some background, but there's nothing
that places him definitively in L.A. Today.

03:38.293 --> 03:40.021
That's it?

03:41.973 --> 03:43.733
What about Interpol?
What do they have on Alvers?

03:43.830 --> 03:48.212
Our data tracking's a little behind,
so we weren't able to access that report.

03:48.341 --> 03:51.381
- Why are we behind?
- We didn't update the European contact logs...

03:51.477 --> 03:52.949
while I was down.

03:55.799 --> 03:57.878
Michelle, you were the ranking agent.

03:57.974 --> 04:01.654
- I-I didn't think Europe was a priority.
- Obviously, it was.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.695
- There was a lot going on at the time.
- " All right."

04:04.822 --> 04:07.958
Let's get back to work
and let's try to ease up on the mistakes...

04:08.054 --> 04:11.831
for the rest of the night as there are
millions of lives depending on us.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.760
Michelle.

04:25.624 --> 04:28.343
Come.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.264
I just got off with C.T.U.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.184
What's the status
on the virus?

04:32.280 --> 04:35.128
Well, it's not good.
The limited intelligence they have supports...

04:35.224 --> 04:38.777
- their original suspicion.
- It's on its way to Los Angeles.

04:38.872 --> 04:41.049
David, it may already be here.

04:43.801 --> 04:46.042
Then we should be prepared in
case they target other cities.

04:46.138 --> 04:48.122
Our people in the security envelope
have been alerted.

04:48.250 --> 04:51.545
Trust me. It's being handled.
Now why don't you try and go get some rest?

04:51.672 --> 04:54.521
- I'm on this.
- " Mr. President?"

04:54.618 --> 04:58.138
"Mrs. Palmer's here to see you."

04:58.233 --> 05:01.306
Send her in, please.

05:01.402 --> 05:06.362
Start waking people up. Set up a conference
call with the appropriate cabinet members.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.625
Homeland Security, F.B.I.,
National Health Services...

05:09.721 --> 05:11.738
- we're gonna need everyone on this one.
- Yes, sir.

05:11.867 --> 05:15.034
Wayne.

05:21.788 --> 05:25.403
Sherry, I asked you here to help me,
not make things worse.

05:25.499 --> 05:28.188
I did not want you
going to Alan Milliken's house.

05:28.285 --> 05:30.139
Well, relax, David. I didn't go there.

05:30.235 --> 05:33.180
- You didn't go?
- No.

05:33.307 --> 05:36.476
When we spoke on the phone...

05:36.572 --> 05:39.741
you told me it was crucial that
you speak toJulia in person.

05:39.836 --> 05:43.549
Yes, and I changed my mind.
I-I spoke to her over the phone.

05:43.645 --> 05:46.941
- About what?
- About Kelly's disappearance. I asked her...

05:47.037 --> 05:49.053
if she would check Alan's cell phone
and see if there were any recently made calls.

05:49.085 --> 05:51.068
If she would check Alan's cell phone
and see if there were any recently made calls.

05:51.165 --> 05:54.300
- And?
- She wouldn't do it.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.126
You don't take no
for an answer, Sherry.

06:04.255 --> 06:08.030
- What aren't you telling me?
- Nothing, David. I swear.

06:08.126 --> 06:11.421
What have you been up to since we
last talked if you weren't at Milliken's?

06:11.549 --> 06:14.623
- Making calls.
- You could've made them from here.

06:14.719 --> 06:16.606
Yes, but I didn't.

06:16.702 --> 06:20.094
I parked on the side of the road. I started
making calls, because I didn't want to wait.

06:20.223 --> 06:24.255
I told you.
We have a small window of opportunity here.

06:24.352 --> 06:28.960
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken
may not have had time to cover his tracks...

06:29.056 --> 06:31.456
when he had someone grab Kelly.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.455
All right.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.039
- I have other things to attend to.
- "Okay."

06:43.168 --> 06:46.465
- Is there anything else?
- That's it.

07:14.594 --> 07:18.370
Hello, Nina. Take her into
Interrogation 8-19.

07:18.498 --> 07:20.322
Yes, sir.

07:22.531 --> 07:24.355
What's the security configuration?

07:24.451 --> 07:26.946
Don't worry about it, Jack.
We're handling Nina.

07:27.075 --> 07:28.962
Ryan, you know what she's capable of.

07:29.091 --> 07:32.420
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to Medical to get checked out.

07:32.547 --> 07:35.043
- I'm fine.
- I don't think you are.

07:35.171 --> 07:37.059
What's this about?

07:37.155 --> 07:40.932
We found evidence
you've been injecting heroin.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.197
Tell me I'm off here, Jack.
Tell me I'm wrong.

07:46.564 --> 07:50.693
- I didn't think so.
- Ryan, I haven't missed a step. I'm fine.

07:50.790 --> 07:54.180
Well, I have to cover my ass.
I need to get you checked out.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.516
You're wasting time.

08:02.341 --> 08:03.942
- Kim.
- Yeah?

08:04.037 --> 08:05.990
Um, I thought you'd
want to know your dad's back.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.422
What about Chase?

08:08.518 --> 08:10.918
Uh, he's a few minutes behind him.

08:11.045 --> 08:12.870
Thank you.

08:39.847 --> 08:43.240
- Kim.
- Dad.

08:43.368 --> 08:45.384
Oh, God.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.185
She's here.

08:50.281 --> 08:53.577
I know, sweetheart. I know.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.995
Look, I have to debrief Chappelle.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.914
I'll see you in a minute, okay?

09:21.961 --> 09:24.458
Dad, I know about
your drug problem.

09:29.450 --> 09:32.618
Why didn't you
come to me with this?

09:35.467 --> 09:38.156
Come here. Come here.

09:41.067 --> 09:44.716
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

09:49.549 --> 09:54.957
I was embarrassed, and it wasn't
your problem, and it still isn't.

09:56.011 --> 09:57.836
I didn't want you to worry.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.588
Well, is it over?

10:02.860 --> 10:04.749
No, not exactly.

10:04.877 --> 10:07.661
I think I'm gonna have to
go into a program, get some help.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.342
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

10:18.957 --> 10:23.053
Chappelle wants me to go into
the clinic and get checked out.

10:23.150 --> 10:25.358
- We'll talk about this later. Okay?
- Okay.

10:25.454 --> 10:27.342
Don't worry.

10:28.463 --> 10:30.830
- I love you.
- I love you too.

10:35.408 --> 10:39.758
Jack, I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.

10:39.886 --> 10:41.710
Thanks, Chloe.

10:52.432 --> 10:54.448
- Chase.
- Yeah?

10:54.576 --> 10:57.201
- I need to talk to you.
- " Okay."

10:57.297 --> 10:59.311
Take a few minutes
and then come in my office.

10:59.439 --> 11:01.935
Yeah, sure.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.546
Mr. Milliken?

11:24.657 --> 11:29.298
Mr. Milliken?
Oh, my God.

11:29.394 --> 11:32.850
Mrs. Milliken! Come quickly!

11:35.474 --> 11:38.354
"Quickly!"

11:47.539 --> 11:49.715
Hey. How's the hand?

11:49.811 --> 11:52.307
It's fine. How'd Chappelle find out?

11:52.436 --> 11:55.733
I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
What's going on out there?

11:55.860 --> 11:58.229
Almeida's gonna be interrogating Nina.
I'll follow it from a feed.

11:58.357 --> 12:01.715
Okay, good. Make sure Tony
puts double security on the doors.

12:01.844 --> 12:04.052
Get back to me as soon as
she gives you anything.

12:04.147 --> 12:06.420
- "Agent Bauer, keep pressure here."
- "Sure. Thank you."

12:10.453 --> 12:15.125
Jack, you're about to find something out
about me that's not gonna make you happy.

12:15.221 --> 12:19.348
- What are you talking about?
- Excuse me. Do you mind?

12:23.638 --> 12:26.006
I've got a daughter.

12:31.222 --> 12:33.238
- A daughter?
- It was sprung on me a month ago.

12:33.367 --> 12:36.085
Her mother dropped her off,
and she split. It's a long story.

12:36.181 --> 12:40.278
- Does Kim know about this?
- Yeah.

12:42.773 --> 12:45.750
- From you?
- I haven't had the chance to talk to her myself yet.

12:45.878 --> 12:48.951
You square this with her, Chase.
You understand me?

12:49.047 --> 12:50.935
You just make it right.

12:51.063 --> 12:54.264
And get back to me as soon as
Nina gives you anything.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.120
I will.

13:11.800 --> 13:15.128
- Are we up yet?
- Yep. Video's piped in.

13:15.257 --> 13:17.593
Voice analysis, vitals, transcription.
They're all set.

13:17.690 --> 13:20.345
- "Nick, do you copy?"
- Yeah, I read you.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.584
- "We're ready to go."
- " All right. Recording to hard drive now."

13:25.657 --> 13:27.800
- So, Tony's doing this?
- Yeah.

13:27.897 --> 13:31.674
- Is that gonna be weird for you?
- What do you mean?

13:31.769 --> 13:34.170
Di-Didn't he and Nina go out?

13:37.177 --> 13:38.425
Yeah.

13:41.178 --> 13:44.634
- We set?
- Yeah.

13:44.762 --> 13:49.914
All right. I want you to do
a high-res on her eyes. She's tired.

13:50.011 --> 13:53.530
- We might be able to pick up a tell.
- Okay.

13:56.540 --> 14:02.170
- So, are we all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

14:05.563 --> 14:07.228
All right. Let's do this.

14:12.604 --> 14:15.708
I got the high-res on monitor two.

14:21.981 --> 14:25.885
Tony. I didn't know
I was going to see you today.

14:26.014 --> 14:28.380
You know what we want.

14:30.653 --> 14:34.045
We need to find Michael Amador
before he unloads the virus.

14:34.173 --> 14:38.877
- I already told Jack everything I know.
- Well, I want you to tell me.

14:38.973 --> 14:42.143
First Jack, now you.

14:42.239 --> 14:44.766
Hmm, what does that remind me of?

14:48.574 --> 14:52.926
You told Jack that Amador
might try to contact a Marcus Alvers?

14:58.591 --> 15:00.640
So, where do we look for Alvers?

15:01.888 --> 15:05.855
That's a nice ring.
Who's the lucky girl?

15:07.710 --> 15:11.137
Hope you did a background check though.
You don't wanna make the same mistake twice.

15:11.264 --> 15:14.112
You're going back to prison.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.512
There's a good chance you'll be
executed as a traitor.

15:16.608 --> 15:19.777
Now you know if you cooperate,
you may be able to save your own life.

15:19.873 --> 15:23.232
But you're stalling,
which means you know something...

15:23.361 --> 15:25.568
and you still think
there's a play you can make.

15:25.664 --> 15:27.553
Only now is not the right time.

15:29.185 --> 15:31.649
Very incisive.

15:31.777 --> 15:35.234
I hope your wife
appreciates that about you.

15:36.737 --> 15:41.474
Why don't you tell me about Alvers?

15:43.714 --> 15:46.818
All I know is that
he works only with Amador.

15:46.914 --> 15:48.866
I don't know him personally.

15:48.993 --> 15:53.378
Well, all we've been able to dig up on him
are a few random medical records.

15:53.506 --> 15:55.363
Under one of his known aliases.

15:55.459 --> 15:59.235
He had an M.R.I. On one of his knees.

15:59.331 --> 16:02.947
There's a prescription for antibiotics.
Treated for H.I.V.

16:05.314 --> 16:08.290
"Her pulse is spiking."

16:08.419 --> 16:11.299
Someone hasn't been using
protection with Marcus Alvers.

16:11.427 --> 16:13.252
She's probably had sex with him.

16:15.747 --> 16:18.916
See, Nina, my colleagues
in the next room tell me...

16:19.012 --> 16:23.332
that something in those medical records...
concerns you.

16:25.795 --> 16:28.261
I'm guessing it's not the knee.

16:53.222 --> 16:56.391
There.

16:59.879 --> 17:01.895
- Marcus.
- Michael.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.646
- How was your trip?
- Interesting.

17:08.742 --> 17:11.719
I still don't understand why
you risked so much down in Mexico...

17:11.846 --> 17:14.023
why you didn't come here directly.

17:17.511 --> 17:20.296
$240 million made it worth the risk.

17:24.776 --> 17:26.598
What about Nina?

17:26.694 --> 17:28.647
If she wasn't killed by the
bomb, I'm sure her buyers...

17:28.776 --> 17:32.233
took care of her once they found out
she didn't deliver the virus.

17:34.984 --> 17:36.585
Either way, she's out of the picture.

17:36.681 --> 17:41.096
I hope so. She can point to both of us.

17:42.761 --> 17:46.058
We'll be long gone
before anyone starts looking.

18:04.203 --> 18:07.340
I got it though.
I can take care of it.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.802
Kim.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.187
- Look, I know we haven't talked since I got back.
- No, we haven't.

18:16.939 --> 18:19.628
I know what you must be thinking.
You need to give me a chance to explain.

18:19.723 --> 18:23.756
I don't know what to think.
Look, I'm happy that you're okay.

18:23.852 --> 18:27.756
But this thing...
You have a baby, Chase.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.069
We've been together for more than three
months, and you kept this secret from me.

18:33.197 --> 18:36.076
Who's the mother?
Where does she fit in to this?

18:36.204 --> 18:39.341
That's what I wanna talk about. I didn't know
I had a daughter until a month ago.

18:39.436 --> 18:43.852
- How could you not know?
- Angela's mother and I went out last year.

18:43.980 --> 18:48.397
Okay? It's over. And when it ended,
she never told me she was pregnant.

18:48.525 --> 18:52.301
Now, she calls a month ago and tells me
she has a baby, and that I'm the father...

18:52.429 --> 18:55.021
and that she's in trouble,
and she can't handle it.

18:57.933 --> 19:00.429
I was afraid to let people find out.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.479
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.

19:03.791 --> 19:05.455
But you told Chloe.

19:05.551 --> 19:09.325
Chloe and my sister have been helping me
take care of the baby. She's a good friend.

19:10.573 --> 19:12.526
Excuse me.

19:12.654 --> 19:16.431
Chase, you wanted me to let you know
when Angela woke up.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.446
- Thank you.
- Sure.

19:21.519 --> 19:23.920
Kim, I'm just as confused as you are.

19:24.048 --> 19:28.463
But all I know is that I love you,
and I'm falling in love with Angela too.

19:28.591 --> 19:30.735
I need to make this work.

19:32.016 --> 19:33.904
Go on.

19:45.808 --> 19:47.825
Hey.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.538
What's happening with
the Nina interrogation?

19:59.665 --> 20:01.553
- They're getting something.
- What?

20:01.649 --> 20:04.018
The connection between Alvers and Nina
might be deeper than we thought.

20:04.146 --> 20:06.387
You better hope she's not spinning your wheels
because she knows how...

20:06.483 --> 20:08.243
to manipulate
our interrogation protocol.

20:08.338 --> 20:10.321
- Tony knows what he's doing.
- Okay, fine.

20:10.449 --> 20:13.842
I need to get together with Chloe.
I need everything she's got
on the Amador investigation.

20:13.970 --> 20:16.370
- Not yet.
- Ryan, look, you're wasting my time.

20:16.498 --> 20:19.762
Now I humored you with the physical.
We both know my blood work's...

20:19.858 --> 20:22.835
gonna come back with trace amounts
of opiates, but enough is enough.

20:22.963 --> 20:26.292
Rae Plachecki from the Inspector General's
office is here. She wants to talk to you.

20:26.419 --> 20:28.787
- Well, this is not the time.
- Actually, it is.

20:28.883 --> 20:33.139
You'll talk to her. Then we'll evaluate
whether you can go back to work or not.

20:33.267 --> 20:35.412
Come on.

20:43.156 --> 20:46.035
Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer.

20:46.164 --> 20:48.597
You know the drill, Jack.
I'm gonna ask you some questions...

20:48.725 --> 20:51.221
but I want you to know
I'm on your side.

20:51.348 --> 20:55.476
We just want to establish if this heroin
addiction was a necessary part of your cover.

20:55.573 --> 20:59.221
It was necessary to maintain my cover.
Are we done now?

20:59.317 --> 21:00.757
Sit down, Jack.

21:10.039 --> 21:13.813
This is Rae Plachecki.
The time is 2:31 a.m.

21:13.941 --> 21:17.078
This is the interrogation of Jack Bauer,
Director of Field Ops, C. T.U.

21:17.173 --> 21:19.831
Ryan Chappelle is present.

21:19.927 --> 21:23.671
Jack, tell us how you established
your cover with Ramon Salazar.

21:23.766 --> 21:29.176
I first came in contact with the Salazars
approximately two years ago.

21:29.271 --> 21:31.511
They were an up-and-coming
narcotic cartel coming out of Mexico.

21:31.607 --> 21:34.103
So when did you meet Amador?

21:38.968 --> 21:41.751
Did you know him
when you were working at C.T.U?

21:46.232 --> 21:48.440
Tell me something, Nina.

21:48.536 --> 21:52.474
What kind of a deal
do you think you're gonna cut?

21:52.602 --> 21:57.817
You betrayed everybody
you know, including me.

21:57.944 --> 22:00.793
You murdered Jack's wife.

22:00.889 --> 22:04.825
You helped terrorists smuggle
a nuclear bomb into this country.

22:06.522 --> 22:11.066
You're helping to unleash a deadly virus
into the general population.

22:14.265 --> 22:17.209
Help me understand this.

22:17.337 --> 22:20.474
What do you want?

22:20.570 --> 22:23.707
What is it you get
out of being a mass murderer?

22:32.251 --> 22:34.170
Your neck is bleeding.

23:06.044 --> 23:07.870
Dalton, what do you got?

23:07.966 --> 23:10.462
So far, the only reactions
we're getting from her are subliminal.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.086
If she's not gonna say anything,
we need to be more plugged into her vitals.

23:13.215 --> 23:16.637
We could take her down to seven,
and give her a passive response test.

23:16.765 --> 23:19.997
Seven's not secure enough.
She stays here.

23:20.093 --> 23:22.271
- Where's Richards?
- He's waiting.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.670
All right. Let's bring him in.

23:26.783 --> 23:28.606
Send Darren in.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.401
Nina, I don't think
you've met Darren Richards.

23:54.496 --> 23:56.800
He joined us after you left.

24:00.864 --> 24:02.592
Hello, Darren.

24:04.865 --> 24:08.993
Don't take it personally.
He doesn't talk much.

24:30.466 --> 24:33.762
Uh, something's not
connecting up for me, Jack.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.738
You say that you weren't in with
the Salazars until early February.

24:36.834 --> 24:39.491
But, the first time you started using
was late December.

24:39.588 --> 24:42.915
That's six weeks of shooting up
for the benefit of no one.

24:43.043 --> 24:46.148
- Am I missing something?
- I was trying to pass myself off as a junkie.

24:46.243 --> 24:48.547
- I wanted to be prepared.
- What do you mean "prepared"?

24:48.644 --> 24:51.491
The Salazars lived their entire lives
in the drug world.

24:51.587 --> 24:54.917
If I couldn't handle the narcotics
that went with that territory...

24:55.044 --> 24:57.316
they'd have known I was a cop,
and they'd have killed me.

24:57.412 --> 25:00.835
- I needed to handle it.
- "Yeah, that makes sense."

25:00.964 --> 25:03.140
But in January,
when you were putting needles in your arm...

25:03.236 --> 25:05.060
you didn't have a meeting
with these guys.

25:05.156 --> 25:08.005
- "It could've been a year for all you knew."
- What are you saying?

25:08.132 --> 25:13.349
I am trying to establish incontrovertible
evidence you did drugs as part of your cover.

25:13.445 --> 25:16.038
If I submit what you just told me,
it's not gonna hold up, Jack.

25:16.134 --> 25:19.301
What do you want me to say?
I did drugs to get in with these people...

25:19.397 --> 25:22.148
and I got in with them!

25:24.453 --> 25:27.718
No matter how difficult
it's been, I don't use anymore.

25:27.813 --> 25:32.103
Look, I'll write it up
that way, and maybe it'll fly.

25:32.230 --> 25:35.782
But I just think you're gonna have
a problem because you never told anyone.

25:35.878 --> 25:38.853
Not even your partner.
That's suspicious.

25:38.982 --> 25:44.359
Rae, you know my history.

25:46.183 --> 25:48.935
I've had a very difficult time
since my wife passed away.

25:49.031 --> 25:52.967
If I told anyone that I was using drugs
to develop a case...

25:53.095 --> 25:55.111
they would have misinterpreted it.

25:55.239 --> 25:57.608
I couldn't afford that risk.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.288
Well, that's what
they're gonna do now.

26:03.720 --> 26:08.457
Rae, let's put down that Jack
started using heroin in late January...

26:08.584 --> 26:11.433
after the first meeting
with Salazar was established.

26:11.529 --> 26:14.377
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Ryan,
but that's not what happened.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.098
Just trying to
save us all some paperwork.

26:17.194 --> 26:21.161
- I'm okay with that.
- I'm not.

26:22.696 --> 26:27.307
I started using in December.
I've got nothing to hide.

26:27.402 --> 26:30.570
This office demands results.

26:30.666 --> 26:33.130
And that's what I provide. Results.

26:35.531 --> 26:39.114
- Fine.
- Can I get back to work?

26:39.211 --> 26:41.193
Not quite yet, Jack.

26:52.075 --> 26:54.282
He'll be here in an hour.

26:54.379 --> 26:59.309
Just as long as we have enough time to leave
the country before they let this virus out.

27:03.211 --> 27:05.259
Please, be seated.

27:08.556 --> 27:13.389
Five hours ago, I went public with a statement
that there was a domestic terror threat.

27:13.516 --> 27:16.205
But it had passed.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.606
And now it appears that
that was premature.

27:18.701 --> 27:21.420
Ladies and gentlemen...

27:21.516 --> 27:26.220
do we or do we not have a threat of
this virus being released?

27:26.317 --> 27:30.030
Sir, I'm afraid we can't answer
that question with any kind of certainty.

27:30.125 --> 27:33.102
- What can you tell me, Mr. Hammond?
- What few leads we have...

27:33.229 --> 27:37.134
indicate that Michael Amador
has the virus and is in Los Angeles.

27:37.262 --> 27:39.630
For what purpose, we can't say.

27:39.725 --> 27:43.470
Then we have to prepare for
defensive action here in Los Angeles.

27:43.567 --> 27:46.415
And for that matter,
in "all of" our major cities.

27:46.511 --> 27:49.806
Mr. President, you know our position
here at Homeland Security.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.727
We think being forthright
with the public...

27:51.823 --> 27:56.142
and making such preparations in
the open is the correct course.

27:56.271 --> 27:59.472
Again, we have to assess
the downside of that course.

27:59.568 --> 28:02.063
I have no problem with that, Mr. President,
as long as we realize...

28:02.191 --> 28:04.270
we are working
against a clock.

28:04.399 --> 28:09.103
I want all departments present to work up
an open versus covert containment strategy...

28:09.199 --> 28:11.344
and report back to me in 30 minutes.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.928
In the meantime, I want Health Services
to issue guidelines...

28:15.057 --> 28:17.713
but only to be distributed internally.

28:17.809 --> 28:21.618
- That is all. I'll be in my office.
- "Mr. President."

28:26.929 --> 28:29.009
David.

28:32.017 --> 28:33.970
Give us a second, please, Aaron.

28:34.097 --> 28:35.954
Of course, sir.

28:42.066 --> 28:46.514
Secret Service just received a phone call
from the West Los Angeles Police Department.

28:46.643 --> 28:49.393
Alan Milliken is dead.

28:49.490 --> 28:53.810
- What?
- He was found 15 minutes ago in his home.

28:53.939 --> 28:56.243
All signs point to a heart attack.

28:59.186 --> 29:02.036
- It isn't possible.
- Well, apparently, it is.

29:05.171 --> 29:07.987
You told me Sherry was on her way
over there about an hour ago.

29:08.083 --> 29:11.763
She changed her mind,
made some phone calls from her car.

29:11.859 --> 29:15.155
Came straight back here.

29:15.283 --> 29:17.172
David, is that what she told you?

29:19.381 --> 29:22.421
- Yeah.
- And where is she now?

29:22.549 --> 29:24.979
Resting.

29:28.884 --> 29:32.053
- Aaron, take me to Sherry.
- Yes, sir.

29:32.149 --> 29:34.165
She's right this way.

29:34.293 --> 29:36.789
- Hasn't your shift ended?
- I stayed on.

29:36.917 --> 29:40.566
I sense it's a difficult day,
and I wanted to be here for you.

29:40.662 --> 29:42.869
- I appreciate that.
- Right in there, sir.

29:42.965 --> 29:44.789
Thank you.

29:51.286 --> 29:53.814
- Sherry.
- David.

29:56.886 --> 30:00.118
- What's wrong?
- Alan Milliken is dead.

30:00.214 --> 30:02.488
What? How?

30:02.583 --> 30:06.135
- Why don't you tell me?
- What do you mean?

30:06.263 --> 30:08.919
- "I told you I didn't go there."
- I know what you told me.

30:09.015 --> 30:12.503
You sat in your car, you made some
phone calls, and you came straight here.

30:12.632 --> 30:15.799
- Yes, and that's the truth.
- Then you won't mind the police
checking your cell phone...

30:15.895 --> 30:19.768
- and the car you used tonight?
- You know...

30:19.896 --> 30:25.015
you asked me to
take care of a problem, and I did.

30:25.111 --> 30:29.368
If you want the police to check phone logs,
then have them check yours first.

30:29.496 --> 30:32.216
Because, remember,
you called me tonight.

30:32.313 --> 30:35.705
I am here because of you, David.

30:39.642 --> 30:41.818
What happened, Sherry?

30:52.506 --> 30:55.802
I went over to the house...

30:55.898 --> 30:58.171
just to speak to Julia.

30:58.266 --> 31:02.971
Alan interrupted us.
There was an argument, and...

31:07.131 --> 31:08.954
he had a heart attack.

31:18.074 --> 31:20.444
There's going to be an investigation.

31:20.540 --> 31:24.317
You're gonna have to
tell the truth about this.

31:24.445 --> 31:26.523
The truth isn't gonna
save either one of us.

31:29.019 --> 31:32.604
All they're going to hear is
that I was there on your behalf...

31:32.700 --> 31:36.060
to prevent Alan from
meddling with your presidency...

31:36.189 --> 31:38.653
and that he died from natural causes.

31:38.781 --> 31:43.198
How do you think that's gonna play out in
"the New York Times for the next six months?"

31:46.461 --> 31:48.284
What did you do to Alan?

31:51.006 --> 31:53.277
Honestly, David?

31:56.414 --> 31:58.238
Nothing.

31:59.358 --> 32:01.183
Absolutely nothing.

32:03.902 --> 32:06.591
Kim, I transferred
that feed to your system.

32:06.687 --> 32:08.959
- Do you want me to pull it up for you now?
- Yeah.

32:20.544 --> 32:22.367
I don't think she's gonna
give them anything.

32:22.464 --> 32:25.793
- We're gonna have to find
Marcus Alvers by ourselves.
- What can I do?

32:25.920 --> 32:28.159
Um, I followed up on
some of his Asian connections.

32:28.255 --> 32:30.143
In the meantime,
there's something I want you to look at.

32:30.271 --> 32:32.639
- It's a long shot...
- What is it?

32:32.736 --> 32:35.617
It's a list of cities where Marcus Alvers
has been in the last three years.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.176
Each time only for a couple of days.
Maybe he was meeting somebody.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.473
Cross it with the other suspects
in our database. Let me know
what you come up with, okay?

32:41.569 --> 32:43.714
Okay.

32:48.096 --> 32:51.009
I don't know why we have to go through
this again. I already answered that.

32:53.473 --> 32:55.202
What is it, Edmunds?

32:55.297 --> 32:57.601
Just want to give you
an update on Nina.

32:57.698 --> 33:00.002
Rae, could you pause that?

33:00.098 --> 33:02.498
- She give us anything new on Alvers?
- No.

33:02.627 --> 33:05.570
Other than the probability she knew him
personally, she's not cooperating.

33:05.698 --> 33:09.187
- What are we doing?
- Richards is working on her now.

33:12.066 --> 33:14.626
- I think that's a mistake.
- Why?

33:14.754 --> 33:17.602
I don't think anybody should be in there
that hasn't worked with her before...

33:17.698 --> 33:19.779
doesn't know what she's capable of...
She'll manipulate him.

33:19.907 --> 33:21.731
All Richards does
is inflict pain.

33:21.828 --> 33:24.004
There's no way for her
to manipulate him.

33:26.628 --> 33:29.219
Right.

33:40.868 --> 33:43.621
How much more of this
you wanna endure, Nina?

33:49.188 --> 33:51.972
I think this is about it.

33:53.446 --> 33:55.685
She hit an artery.

33:55.780 --> 33:57.669
- Michelle, call Medical!
- "No, she's bleeding too much!"

33:57.797 --> 33:59.494
- We gotta take her there now!
- Tell Security...

33:59.590 --> 34:02.086
We need someone from Medical.
Interrogation Room 8-19.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.007
- Uncuff her!
- " Now!"

34:20.231 --> 34:22.630
So what did Sherry have to say?

34:22.759 --> 34:26.632
- That Alan had a heart attack.
- And you believe her?

34:26.760 --> 34:30.695
I'd be a fool to believe anything
Sherry says to save herself.

34:32.614 --> 34:37.192
But murder?
I can't imagine she'd do that.

34:37.288 --> 34:39.656
David, we can't allow ourselves to be
caught off guard this time.

34:39.752 --> 34:41.800
Now we have to assume the worst.

34:44.007 --> 34:47.592
Then we'd also have to assume
that Julia was somehow involved.

34:47.688 --> 34:50.409
What?

34:50.504 --> 34:53.192
Whoa. Whoa, listen.

34:53.288 --> 34:56.233
David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not
the same kind of person that Sherry is.

34:58.505 --> 35:02.089
When we find out all the facts,
we'll proceed from there.

35:04.042 --> 35:06.313
I have to go over
the morning brief with Jerry.

35:06.409 --> 35:08.233
All right.

35:26.443 --> 35:28.908
- Hello.
- Julia, it's me.

35:29.036 --> 35:33.002
- Wayne?
- I just heard about Alan, and l...

35:33.130 --> 35:36.907
- Are you alone?
- The police are here.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.987
I was just going to speak
with one of the officers.

35:39.116 --> 35:40.684
All right. Tell me what happened.

35:40.812 --> 35:43.436
Wayne, Sherry was here
when it happened.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.420
But she told me
not to tell the police.

35:45.516 --> 35:48.877
Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly
what happened over there, all right?

35:49.005 --> 35:51.884
We were talking with Alan.

35:52.012 --> 35:53.836
He got excited.

35:53.932 --> 35:56.845
Then he started to gasp for air.

35:56.973 --> 35:59.693
- He gets angina.
- So you called 911, right?

35:59.788 --> 36:03.021
No. No. I-I tried to
give him his medication.

36:03.117 --> 36:04.878
What do you mean you tried?

36:07.180 --> 36:12.590
Sherry stopped me. I went to help Alan,
and she grabbed my arm.

36:12.719 --> 36:15.694
I just stood there.

36:15.821 --> 36:19.437
I-I couldn't move.

36:19.533 --> 36:21.550
I killed him, Wayne.

36:21.678 --> 36:23.695
Shh, shh.
All right, listen to me carefully.

36:23.822 --> 36:26.991
- I killed him.
- Call Alan's lawyer and do not say anything...

36:27.087 --> 36:29.488
anything to anyone, until he gets there...
you understand me?

36:32.112 --> 36:34.830
Wa-Wayne, could you
come down here and help me?

36:34.926 --> 36:36.654
No, and please, don't call me.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.247
I will help you, Julia, I will.

36:39.375 --> 36:41.424
But for right now, I have to
keep my distance. I'm sorry.

36:49.008 --> 36:50.864
Come on. Come on! Let's go!

36:53.136 --> 36:55.503
One, two, three.

36:57.009 --> 36:59.281
- Carotid's been lacerated. Start a twilight drip.
- "Yes, Doctor."

37:01.296 --> 37:02.705
- Clamp.
- Clamp.

37:02.832 --> 37:05.233
" Line, please."

37:05.361 --> 37:07.473
- Keep steady pressure.
- Yes, Doctor.

37:07.602 --> 37:11.794
- Got it in?
- Yeah, I gotta get around there.

37:11.890 --> 37:15.153
- " 3.0 silks."
- " 3.0 standing by."

37:15.249 --> 37:18.161
- " More gauze."
- " Gauze."

37:18.289 --> 37:20.369
- "Got it open."
- " Okay, clamp it."

37:20.497 --> 37:22.866
Here you go, Doctor.

37:22.993 --> 37:25.234
- " Keep the pressure on."
- "Yes, sir."

37:25.330 --> 37:28.627
"Let's get some more gauze in here."

37:30.451 --> 37:31.987
Okay, she's under.

37:32.116 --> 37:36.050
I want you two stationed here. Do not
leave unless you hear directly from me!

37:46.004 --> 37:49.269
Okay, Jack, those are all the questions
I'm obliged to ask.

37:49.364 --> 37:52.660
If you've got anything else
you wanna add, Jack, now would be the time.

37:52.787 --> 37:54.196
That's my statement... as it is.

37:56.371 --> 37:58.644
My, God! Tony!

37:58.741 --> 38:00.308
Nina tried to commit suicide.

38:00.437 --> 38:02.708
She jammed her neck into
Richard's needle, ruptured an artery.

38:02.805 --> 38:05.653
- Where is she now?
- She's in the clinic being operated on.

38:05.749 --> 38:08.309
- Who's with her?
- Don't worry, Jack. She's sedated.

38:08.437 --> 38:09.972
Tony, who's with her?

38:10.100 --> 38:11.732
Damn it!

38:30.839 --> 38:34.776
Which way did she go?
Lock down the building!

38:34.903 --> 38:38.678
This is Ryan Chappelle.
Nina Myers is loose in the building.

38:38.805 --> 38:40.887
Lock it down. Now!

39:33.851 --> 39:35.803
Nina...

39:35.931 --> 39:41.049
drop the gun,
put your hands on your head.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.995
Now!

39:46.907 --> 39:49.595
Kim, what the hell are you doing?

39:49.692 --> 39:53.212
- "You don't wanna be any part of this."
- Shut up.

39:54.812 --> 39:58.202
Just turn around and walk away.

39:59.707 --> 40:01.724
If you leave now, you won't get hurt.

40:05.179 --> 40:08.028
Kim.

40:11.133 --> 40:13.500
Don't do it, Nina.
I swear to God I'll shoot you.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.965
You won't kill me.

40:16.062 --> 40:18.398
Nina, damn it!

40:19.805 --> 40:22.173
Kim, back up. Back up.

40:27.229 --> 40:30.397
Kim, I want you to go back into C. T.U.
Tell 'em we've got Nina.

40:30.493 --> 40:33.886
- Dad, listen to me. We need...
- Kim, go now!

40:35.486 --> 40:37.855
Please, baby, just go.

40:53.855 --> 40:56.639
You don't have any more
useful information, do you, Nina?

40:57.696 --> 41:00.287
I do.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.201
No, you don't.
