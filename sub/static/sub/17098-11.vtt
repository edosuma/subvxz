No, I fixed it from spraying

-Because I broke it.

And then I turned the
water off. And that fixed it.

you can't use the toilet.

I see you brought chocolates.

Yes. Your mother always
used to like cho-co-let-tu.

-To make sure.
-Uh-huh.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.667
I didn't know he was coming.

19:32.709 --> 19:33.792
Okay.

19:33.834 --> 19:35.959
Janet just wanted
to see us dance.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
Yeah.

19:38.709 --> 19:40.041
Janet tell me.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.041
So, you not mad?

19:44.291 --> 19:46.500
When I walk in,
see you two dancing,

19:46.542 --> 19:47.709
you know what I think?

19:48.583 --> 19:49.667
Divorce?

19:49.709 --> 19:52.041
I think of first night
I ever see you.

19:53.542 --> 19:54.500
Was I dancing with Edwin?

19:55.417 --> 19:58.291
I don't know. I only see you.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.250
I like dancing.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.333
I like watching you dance.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.041
You happy when you dancing.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.542
You ever think
you make mistake?

20:17.667 --> 20:18.667
Yeah.

20:19.125 --> 20:20.500
I should marry you sooner.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.834
Let's go sometime. Dancing.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.166
Hmm.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.583
Or maybe,
we do some dancing here?

20:33.917 --> 20:36.041
(LAUGHING) Oh, Appa...

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
(LAUGHING)

20:42.875 --> 20:43.792
How did things go
at Kimchee's?

20:43.834 --> 20:46.917
Hmm.
Good. I fix his toilet.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.458
Did you fix anything else
while you were there?

20:49.834 --> 20:51.500
Yeah, knob.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.542
And, by knob, you mean...

20:53.583 --> 20:55.041
Not Kimchee.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.000
We fix actual knob
and actual ballcock.

20:58.917 --> 21:00.917
Okay, I'm going
to stop talking now.

21:03.917 --> 21:04.917
Janet.

21:04.959 --> 21:05.959
Hmm?

21:06.917 --> 21:07.917
You like ice cream?

21:08.458 --> 21:09.709
You know I do.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.250
We should go to that
ice cream place, Amelia's.

21:13.458 --> 21:14.792
Yeah, sure.

21:14.834 --> 21:17.917
Maybe you take a picture
of us eating ice cream.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.083
I'd like that.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.125
Me too.

21:22.750 --> 21:23.750
(CHUCKLES)

21:24.792 --> 21:26.792
