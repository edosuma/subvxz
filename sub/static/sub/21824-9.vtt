WEBVTT

00:02.040 --> 00:03.087
Previously...

00:03.160 --> 00:05.527
- Daddy.
- Daddy, who is that woman?

00:05.600 --> 00:07.728
- Daddy?
- Sassenach witch!

00:07.800 --> 00:11.407
- Laoghaire?
- He's my husband now.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.527
What does Laoghaire want?

00:12.600 --> 00:14.728
She may be amenable to alimony.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.882
Where do you intend
to get the money to pay her?

00:16.960 --> 00:21.363
There's a box full of ancient coins
on Selkie island.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.602
Can't swim anywhere.
Not until that arm's healed.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.806
I can swim that.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.764
I'm just not sure if we
belong together any more.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.006
How can you say that?

00:29.080 --> 00:31.321
It's been so much harder
than I could ever have imagined.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.404
You belong with me.
We're mated for life, Sassenach.

00:34.840 --> 00:35.921
Jamie.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.160
Where's Ian?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.242
- Ian!
- Go back!

00:42.160 --> 00:43.286
Ian!

00:48.400 --> 00:50.607
Sing me a song

00:50.680 --> 00:53.445
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.720 --> 00:56.326
Say, could that lass

00:56.400 --> 00:58.289
Be I?

00:59.280 --> 01:01.408
Merry of soul

01:01.480 --> 01:04.483
She sailed on a day

01:04.560 --> 01:07.040
Over the sea

01:07.120 --> 01:09.088
To Skye

01:09.760 --> 01:12.286
Billow and breeze

01:12.360 --> 01:14.761
Islands and seas

01:14.840 --> 01:18.845
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.160 --> 01:22.811
All that was good

01:22.880 --> 01:25.201
All that was fair

01:25.280 --> 01:27.806
All that was me

01:27.880 --> 01:30.360
Is gone

01:30.440 --> 01:33.171
Sing me a song

01:33.280 --> 01:35.726
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.800 --> 01:38.565
Say, could that lass

01:38.640 --> 01:40.802
Be I?

01:40.880 --> 01:43.486
Merry of soul

01:43.560 --> 01:46.245
She sailed on a day

01:46.320 --> 01:50.245
Over the sea

01:50.320 --> 01:54.769
To Skye

02:29.320 --> 02:30.560
It's all arranged, then.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.690
You'll act as supercargo
in charge of the freight.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.924
Master Raines is glad
not to have the responsibility.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.165
- She's not much, but...
- She'll do.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.204
Boy, the weather is beginning to turn.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.247
Even a brig of this size will be
bobbin' like a cork.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.521
But, at least
you'll have a physician at hand

02:50.880 --> 02:52.803
when ye begin retching yer innards.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.720
I'll manage.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.886
All that matters now is Young Ian.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.601
Yes.

03:02.840 --> 03:06.128
Well, the harbourmaster had record
of only one three-masted frigate

03:06.200 --> 03:09.249
sailing under the Portuguese flag,
the Bruja.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.845
Her home port is Jamaica.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.928
She was riding very low
in the water.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.049
Hold must've been laden.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.361
Then they would most likely
be on their way home.

03:18.480 --> 03:23.042
Dinna fash, a healthy male can be sold for
upward of 30 pounds in Jamaica.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.729
As long as he doesn't make trouble,
Ian will be fine.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.328
West Indies is our best chance, then.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.006
Thank you, Jared.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.960
You've been of great help.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.246
Ban voyage.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.290
God be with you.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.566
And the lad.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.161
'Twas ill luck

03:47.520 --> 03:49.602
to use the money to pay Laoghaire

03:50.280 --> 03:51.725
so I could be wi' you.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.041
Maybe I'm being punished
for wanting too much.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.010
Jamie, no god
worth his salt would

03:58.080 --> 04:01.402
take your nephew away from you
just because you wanted to be happy.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.931
Will we be?

04:04.840 --> 04:05.841
Happy?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.041
I meant what I said.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.251
You belong with me, but...

04:12.280 --> 04:15.250
If ye truly want to go back,
I'll take ye to the stones myself.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.009
The most important thing right now
is that we find Young Ian.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.970
Captain Raines wants to cast off.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.569
If we don't, we'll no catch the tide.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.291
Maybe we should leave tomorrow
on a fresh tide.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.407
Fresh tide?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.324
They're all the same, ye numbskull.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.528
- He's full of nerves.
- Aye, it's no "nerves."

04:37.360 --> 04:38.725
Twice I've been in a ship.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.208
Once when they took me from Scotland
as an indentured slave,

04:42.280 --> 04:43.805
another when I returned home.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.450
If it wasna for Mac Dubh,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.205
I would no be setting foot on that
bucket of shite.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.851
Well, if it's any consolation,

04:50.920 --> 04:53.526
I'm not one for sea voyages either.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.969
But, we're very glad
of your help.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.081
Has Willoughby arrived?

04:58.160 --> 04:59.366
Aye. He's on deck now.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.762
Then inform Captain Raines that
we have sufficient crew aboard.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.526
Just waiting on Fergus.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.967
The wee frog's already on board,
Mac Dubh. Fergus and...

05:07.040 --> 05:10.442
And the baggage from... Lallybroch.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.086
The lad's brought you
some clothes and supplies.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.331
Let's go.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.608
Since Jenny and Ian think we're
still headed to France...

05:27.720 --> 05:29.768
They'll not yet be worried.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.321
I've sent them a letter
explaining everything.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.011
Try and look at the horizon.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.329
It might help alleviate the nausea.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.841
I haven't
noticed my stomach yet, Sassenach.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.410
Watching Scotland fall away
is causing pain enough.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.285
I won't set foot on our shores again
wi'out Young Ian.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.286
We will find him.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.520
Aye.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.243
If this fair wind holds,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.684
we should gain on the Bruja.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.205
Good day.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.321
Morning, sir.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.725
Let's get settled in.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.921
Right.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.490
You should touch the horseshoe, Sassenach.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.810
It's bad luck not to.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.724
If it'll make you happy.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.126
Day to you.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.201
And you!

07:10.600 --> 07:12.204
Am I invisible?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.731
No. Women are bad luck
on ships, Sassenach.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.286
Redheads too.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.089
- So you're bad luck.
- Aye.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.243
That's why they address me first
before I speak to them.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.649
It's the only way
to avoid misfortune.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.965
How has Scotland
survived all these centuries?

07:30.320 --> 07:32.322
It's not just the Scots, Sassenach.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.687
The English, Spanish, Dutch,
all have sea-fearing superstitions.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.722
Ye dinna want to be caught with a banana

07:42.160 --> 07:43.924
on a French frigate.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.161
Milord?

07:45.240 --> 07:46.571
Fergus.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.931
Marsali?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.440
What the hell are you doing here?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.289
Fergus and I are married.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.564
What in the name
of Holy God do you mean?

08:03.640 --> 08:05.563
You hardly know each other.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.962
We've been courting
since last August,

08:08.040 --> 08:10.042
and we were handfast this morning.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.201
Handfast?

08:11.280 --> 08:14.124
A custom that allows
two people to be married

08:14.200 --> 08:17.727
if they clasp hands in front of witnesses
and declare themselves wed.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.207
Not if...

08:24.640 --> 08:25.880
Have you bedded her?

08:25.960 --> 08:27.121
Not yet, Milord.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.849
Then it is not yet binding.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.679
Captain.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.091
We need to make for shore.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.010
If there's anything you need,
we'll be putting in at St Ives

08:39.280 --> 08:40.725
for final provisions.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.643
Then Marsali will disembark there.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.324
I'll send someone to see her home.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.243
This voyage is too dangerous for a lass.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.526
You're taking her.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.006
Claire is no concern of yours.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.970
You left my mother for this English whore,

08:54.040 --> 08:57.010
making her a laughingstock,
and ye say it's no my concern?

08:57.080 --> 08:59.526
The hellish nerve ye ha',
telling me what I shall do.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.167
Marsali, you must not speak
about Milady in such a way.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.162
- Does your mother ken?
- I sent her a letter.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.045
And she'll have me killed.
I am sending you home.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.009
I'll tell everyone Fergus
has already bedded me.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.205
He hasn't, but I'll say it anyway.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.966
So, you see, I shall
either be married or ruined.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.407
Fine.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.530
You can sail to Jamaica.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.203
Then, l am taking you home.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.649
But Fergus does not touch you.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.687
We have two cabins.
Fergus will be with me.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.250
Marsali will be with Claire.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.321
What?
- What?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.048
Let's go inside.
You're going to be sick.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.365
I feel fine.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.723
No, you don't.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.410
We've been apart for 20 years,

10:03.480 --> 10:05.244
and you want me to room with her?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.248
Marsali's under my care now,
like it or not.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.925
I'm obliged to protect her virtue.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.010
Mine as well, it would seem.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.369
Now I am gonna be sick.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.762
You can't possibly
be comfortable there.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.970
You should try a hammock.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.365
A swing is no helpful.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.080
Here.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.207
What in God's name are ye
forcing me to drink?

10:53.560 --> 10:54.925
Ginger tea.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.160
Can't believe Fergus
lied to me about Marsali.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.851
Their courting since August.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.011
Well, I don't think they've
thought through what it means

11:12.080 --> 11:13.411
to spend a lifetime together.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.162
But neither did we
when we were first married.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.122
That's because our marriage was arranged.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.601
What is that?

11:24.760 --> 11:27.286
The happy couple brought some of
our things from Lallybroch.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.440
Our things?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.162
These are my clothes
from when we were in Paris.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.010
You kept them!

11:41.880 --> 11:44.042
- Why didn't you sell them all?
- Sell them?

11:45.320 --> 11:46.890
Memories of you?

11:47.800 --> 11:48.801
Never.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.282
That green cloak
that Marsali was wearing.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.084
I knew I recognised it from somewhere.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.207
Yeah.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.645
Couldna sell yer garments,

11:58.960 --> 12:00.928
but... After I thought
I'd never see ye again,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.889
seemed all right
if Marsali made use of them.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.242
- Hope you dinna mind.
- No.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.450
Now, has she altered them all?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.411
Not all.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.086
Here.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.126
Have some more tea.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.362
With hope, it'll be calmer tomorrow.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.370
I'll be dead by then.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.128
See to it that I'm
buried at Lallybroch.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.922
Mistress Claire, you're needed.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.851
We were both near the main mast.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.081
One of the lines snapped and
the deadeye hit him in the head.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.840
What is your name?

12:47.920 --> 12:49.001
Manzetti.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.562
- And do you know where you are?
- On a ship.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.366
Well, where are you going?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.882
The West Indies. Same as you, no?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.921
I don't think you have a concussion.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.126
What?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.850
The cut's not deep.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.808
You'll likely have a scar
and a nasty headache.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.087
I have some peppermint oil
that will help with that.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.685
How did this happen?

13:17.560 --> 13:18.641
I don't know.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.041
The main topsail sheet was
suddenly upon me.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.170
Did you not touch the horseshoe?

13:23.400 --> 13:25.482
I did, Mr Warren. We all did.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.165
Well, someone didn't.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.685
A mishap as such while still
in sight of land's an ill omen.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.650
You know it as well as I.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.407
Accidents do happen, Mr Warren.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.726
I'm sure you believe that, madam, but when
you've been at sea as long as we have,

13:43.440 --> 13:47.889
well, "There are more things in heaven
and earth, Horatio..."

13:47.960 --> 13:50.611
"Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

13:51.840 --> 13:53.410
Shakespeare was a very wise man.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.681
Indeed.

13:56.480 --> 14:01.407
Madam, I wonder if you and your husband
would care to dine with me this evening.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.646
Well, of course.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.046
Though I think my husband
might find the idea of food

14:07.120 --> 14:08.724
a little off-putting at the moment.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.087
Thank you.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.321
All right.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.451
You hardly know her.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.570
You didn't know Milady long at all
before you were married.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.926
That was different.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.525
We were forced to marry.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.170
Milord, you forget.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.685
I know your story.

14:32.760 --> 14:36.401
If you were forced to marry Milady,
then I'm forced to breathe.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.604
My heart, it is forced to beat.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.531
You yourself have told me
you wanted her more than life

14:42.600 --> 14:44.125
from the moment you saw her.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.920
You didn't need time.

14:47.680 --> 14:48.806
Nor do I.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.122
I thought you'd be happy for me,

14:52.400 --> 14:57.122
at least I hoped as much,
once you'd overcome your surprise.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.168
Then why did you
lie to me all this time?

15:02.600 --> 15:05.729
The same reason you
didn't tell Milady about Laoghaire.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.087
I was a coward.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.770
Did you lie to Marsali too?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.408
Marsali and I do not have secrets.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.129
She kens about your past, does she?

15:21.240 --> 15:23.607
That I grew up in a brothel? Yes.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.326
And I was a pickpocket.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.129
And what about all yer other lasses?

15:28.440 --> 15:29.487
No, but...

15:29.560 --> 15:31.642
In Spring, it was Aileen

15:31.720 --> 15:33.051
and in summer it was...

15:33.840 --> 15:35.171
- Rhona.
- Rhona.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.402
And then you bedded Cairstine and...

15:37.480 --> 15:38.811
I understand, Milord.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.450
But I have not lain with Marsali.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.171
Or with any other woman
since we began our courtship.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.405
I've waited.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.284
Does that not mean something?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.248
Not if you can't be honest with her.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.641
I'm sorry your husband
is too unwell to join us.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.040
But it's me you wanted
at your table, wasn't it?

16:11.440 --> 16:14.011
I questioned your authority
in regards to the horseshoe.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.322
I merely wish to help you,
Mistress Fraser,

16:19.600 --> 16:23.082
to understand the rigours of sea
and gain the crew's respect

16:23.160 --> 16:24.730
as ship's surgeon.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.402
You must put yourself
in their shoes.

16:27.480 --> 16:31.087
After all, on this ship,
your very presence is ill luck.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.004
So my husband has informed me.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.005
By rights, you and Mistress MacKimmie
should, at this moment, be bare-breasted.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.566
I'm sorry?

16:40.640 --> 16:43.166
A woman's bare breasts
calm an angry sea.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.206
But then on, the figurehead at the bow,
she bares her breasts for you,

16:47.280 --> 16:49.601
and prevents us
from being subject to any curses.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.251
Well, how kind of her.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.042
The horseshoe is more complicated.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.406
There's no substitute.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.609
Surely you don't believe
by touching a piece of iron,

17:00.680 --> 17:02.170
it'll bring us better luck.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.330
I've sailed on many ships, madam,

17:04.400 --> 17:07.131
and on each one the sailors
have their superstitions.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.722
Anything that provides them
with a sense of assurance

17:09.839 --> 17:11.251
is, in my view, to be encouraged.

17:11.319 --> 17:15.530
The disadvantage being,
that men can also lose faith

17:15.920 --> 17:17.887
when the portents signify disaster.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.248
Even then, I would rather
have them make their luck

17:21.319 --> 17:22.685
than give up all hope.

17:24.079 --> 17:28.563
It matters not whether I believe touching
a piece of iron will bring good luck.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.846
The men believe it.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.570
And they believe someone has not.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.601
Believing something doesn't make it real.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.444
On this ship, it does.

17:41.880 --> 17:45.168
There is nothing either good or bad,
but thinking makes it so.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.600
How long will you continue this farce?

18:13.360 --> 18:17.046
I must allow time
for my wife's tea to do its work.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.568
This retching.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.170
It can eat your stomach,

18:24.680 --> 18:28.969
tear your muscles,
and your testicles,

18:29.040 --> 18:32.567
they can get twisted, most painful.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.844
The only cure is removal.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.082
But if you want to wait,

18:42.520 --> 18:43.806
that is your choice.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.771
That looks bigger.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.444
Ye won't bump your head
when ye get up.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.965
Marsali, you don't have to try
and get in my good graces

19:10.040 --> 19:11.804
just so I'll put in
a good word with Jamie.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.408
It's really none of my business.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.086
So, you drop out of the clear blue sky,

19:19.240 --> 19:21.004
sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong,

19:21.080 --> 19:22.809
ruining my family,

19:22.880 --> 19:25.008
and now, you're minding your own business.

19:26.120 --> 19:30.808
Well, Daddy may think you're a wise woman,
but I still think you're a whore.

19:32.120 --> 19:36.045
All right. Well, the whore should
have the bigger bed then, shouldn't she?

20:13.600 --> 20:16.080
A very pleasant day,
is it not, Sassenach?

20:16.440 --> 20:17.726
Yes, it is.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.969
Well, you're certainly feeling better.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.771
Fergus told me everything.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.807
I'm not so naive to think
he hasn't been with lassies.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.723
And now we only want
to be with each other.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.204
We're hoping you'll bless our union.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.962
Perhaps you should give them a chance.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.884
I'm trying to help you.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.728
If you let them
continue their infatuation,

20:54.800 --> 20:56.484
it might just fizzle out.

20:58.520 --> 21:02.730
I don't know what a "fizzle" is,
but... I ken your meaning well enough.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.605
And "fizzle out" is what I'm afraid of.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.601
I'm sorry.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.681
I can't allow it.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.441
What is that?

22:15.080 --> 22:17.447
It is a poem.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.606
Is that more poetry?

22:24.840 --> 22:25.966
No.

22:26.560 --> 22:32.647
I've been scribing the story of my life
in China so that it will not be forgotten.

22:36.440 --> 22:41.367
A story told is a life lived.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.091
- Would you tell it to me?
- Not yet.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.130
Once I tell it, I have to let it go.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.246
The days started blending together.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.123
For me, this meant
tending to minor injuries.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.044
And making medicines.

23:31.080 --> 23:35.051
Being on the ship at sea
with endless horizons appealed to me.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.371
It reminded me of a simpler time.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.002
Took the lobster home

23:45.080 --> 23:48.527
And I couldn't find a dish
So it was put it in the pot

23:48.600 --> 23:50.523
Where the mistress has a piss

23:50.600 --> 23:52.762
Singing aye tiddly aye

23:52.840 --> 23:54.729
Aye tiddly O

23:54.800 --> 23:58.361
Aye tiddly aye fiddly aye tiddly 0

24:00.480 --> 24:04.121
Early the next morning
The old woman arose

24:04.200 --> 24:07.886
She leapt around the room
With the lobster on her cunt

24:07.960 --> 24:10.167
Singing Aye tiddiy aye

24:10.240 --> 24:12.129
Aye tiddly O

24:12.200 --> 24:15.921
Aye tiddly aye fiddly aye tiddly O

24:17.760 --> 24:21.321
Husband, husband
She cried out to me

24:23.360 --> 24:24.964
Jamie, you should hear the...

24:25.840 --> 24:26.966
Claire.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.601
My apology.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.923
He did not want to, but I insisted.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.884
Didn't want to what?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.126
Zam gau...

24:39.200 --> 24:40.486
For the vomiting.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.561
Acupuncture.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.290
It is my fault, I should never have...

24:43.360 --> 24:44.771
It's all right, Willoughby.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.766
You can go.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.966
So this is what's cured your seasickness.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.683
And not the tea that I've been
making twice a day for three weeks?

25:01.960 --> 25:03.166
Why didn't you tell me?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.650
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

25:06.960 --> 25:10.601
You'd honestly think that I'd
want you to suffer to save my pride?

25:10.680 --> 25:13.968
We aren't on the most stable ground,
are we, Sassenach?

25:14.040 --> 25:16.327
I didna want ye to see it
as more proof

25:16.400 --> 25:17.731
ye dinna belong here.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.486
Jamie...

25:22.520 --> 25:27.003
My return has been
confusing and frustrating.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.766
But it's never been a question
of whether I love you.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.364
I should've told you outright.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.884
You look like a pincushion.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.850
Yeah. I feel like a damn pincushion.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.649
But I haven't vomited for weeks.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.081
What is it?

25:57.240 --> 25:58.446
We're not moving.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.851
I can't explain it, Captain.
We're on course.

26:24.360 --> 26:25.566
Captain.

26:26.840 --> 26:27.966
What's wrong?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.326
Why aren't we moving?

26:29.440 --> 26:31.283
We've lost the wind, Mr Fraser.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.404
What have you in your face?

26:37.800 --> 26:40.804
It is Chinese treatment for seasickness.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.571
Very healthy.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.685
Is it common to lose the wind
in these latitudes?

26:52.120 --> 26:53.610
No, it's bad luck.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.728
Someones brought this on us
with their neglect.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.882
It's a bit unusual for this season,
but there's no cause for concern.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.371
I'd say it's the Chinaman.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.125
It's not him. I saw the Chinese
touch the horseshoe.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.564
Well, why don't we all just
line up and touch the horseshoe now?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.165
And that way,
we can make sure that everyone

27:15.240 --> 27:16.605
has complied with the rules of the ship.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.125
Aye. Good idea.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.528
It's too late for that. It must be done
at the beginning of a voyage.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.922
Fear not. The wind will return.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.401
We must endeavour
to be ready when it does.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.082
Is it really just you and me?

28:03.760 --> 28:05.125
You and me.

28:08.360 --> 28:09.930
And the man in the moon.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.406
You know,

28:20.960 --> 28:22.883
before I left Boston,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.082
men had just flown to the moon.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.603
I wonder what it looks like.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.606
Up there.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.485
I saw pictures.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.846
Photographs.

28:39.120 --> 28:43.682
It was rocky and barren,
and there was no life at all.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.846
It was beautiful.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.369
You can see the craters from here.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.365
The dark spots.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.324
Yeah, that's his face.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.247
He seems close enough,
you can speak to him.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.840
"Goodnight, moon.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.082
"Goodnight, cow jumping over the moon.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.731
"Goodnight, light.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.440
"And the red balloon."

29:23.640 --> 29:24.971
It's from a book

29:26.320 --> 29:28.561
I used to read Brianna
when she was little.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.531
She could recite the whole thing
before she could even read.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.607
She used to say it
to her favourite toy bunny.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.531
She loved rabbits.

29:52.640 --> 29:53.721
You miss her?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.161
Terribly.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.647
The days turned into weeks.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.722
And the wind did not return.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.050
We were becalmed
in the middle of a vast ocean.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.966
Hundreds of miles from the nearest shore.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.881
Even the most experienced sailors
were growing anxious

30:35.080 --> 30:37.208
and beginning to fear the worst.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.451
Damn, blazing Hades!

30:40.520 --> 30:42.841
Filth-eating son of a pig fart.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.130
The water's gone bad.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.089
Every one are foul and stinkin'.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.730
Bilge water's got into it.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.407
Don't! It will be filled with disease.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.927
Christ.

30:56.760 --> 31:00.003
Salvage what you can. The top row may be
unspoiled. Boil the rest.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.330
And go to half-rations
for every man.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.165
Pray for rain.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.765
I have another suggestion.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.127
We find the Jonah
who's brought us ill luck,

31:18.960 --> 31:20.724
and we throw him overboard.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.961
Aye.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.281
Aye.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.125
Five unspoiled barrels
wouldn't be enough.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.450
Losing the wind happens, of course.

31:38.520 --> 31:42.127
We can wait for it to return
but not without water or ale.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.925
So who should we blame?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.082
The bilge water spoiled the barrels.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.561
It's no one's fault.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.166
I said nothing of fault, madam.
I asked who we shall blame.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.688
We've been weeks without wind.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.091
What's your meaning, sir?

31:58.520 --> 32:00.090
The men are calling for a Jonah.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.922
The men want to throw someone overboard?

32:08.640 --> 32:11.291
- And you are going to let them.
- I may not be able to stop them.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.491
That's insanity.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.722
I've only so much
at my disposal to keep order.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.450
This is not a royal Navy vessel, madam.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.091
I can't flog the men
if they disregard my authority.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.407
They must believe

32:23.240 --> 32:26.289
that I'm doing all I can on their behalf,
or we shall have a mutiny.

32:31.360 --> 32:36.241
You will not be throwing
any of my men overboard, Captain.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.286
I saw the frog's lassie
touch the horseshoe.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.646
As did I.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.361
The frog did as well.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.931
I saw all those
accompanying the supercargo touch it too.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.440
Save one.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.008
Jonah?
- Leave us be.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.521
You need not worry.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.926
It's your friend
who should be afeared.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.331
I'm not worried.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.770
I don't fear the likes of you.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.282
You're not long for this world, Jonah.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.885
I dinna think I touched it.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.842
Jump, you snivelling dog-faced scum!

33:42.920 --> 33:45.048
- Over the side with him.
- Rid us of this curse!

33:45.120 --> 33:46.849
Leave me be, you bastards!

33:48.960 --> 33:50.371
Go on! Jump!

33:50.440 --> 33:51.726
He's clear up there, Mac Dubh.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.251
Get back!

33:54.320 --> 33:57.130
If I'm gonna die, I'll be
doing it by my own hand.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.291
He's drunk. The crew
marked him as the Jonah.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.124
They say he didn't
touch the horseshoe.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.929
And he can't even remember
if he did or not.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.365
They intend to throw him overboard.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.448
He scurried up there
trying to get away from them all.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.245
And now he's thinking they might be right.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.163
Christ! HaYes!

34:15.080 --> 34:16.684
Ye havena cursed us, HaYes.

34:16.760 --> 34:19.922
Even so, we're going
to run out of water and die.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.364
We won't!

34:21.760 --> 34:22.761
I promise.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.206
Leave him be.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.809
Have I not always
told you the truth?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.005
Jump, Jonah!

34:30.080 --> 34:31.605
Dinna waste the climb, Mac Dubh!

34:31.679 --> 34:33.205
- It's you...
- Throw yourself over!

34:33.280 --> 34:34.440
Or all of us.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.806
Jump!

34:36.560 --> 34:38.085
You have to stop this!

34:38.159 --> 34:39.969
I don't, if it staves off a mutiny.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.768
- Jump!
- Jump, Jonah!

34:41.840 --> 34:43.728
You remember Ardsmuir...

34:44.639 --> 34:45.801
It was us against them.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.641
It is the same now.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.051
We'll have you bouncing off the decks!

34:49.120 --> 34:50.167
Let him jump!

34:51.400 --> 34:52.400
Don't listen to them.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.085
Listen to me.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.161
Jump, man. Jump.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.406
Throw yourself over!

34:57.480 --> 34:58.481
Let him go!

34:58.640 --> 34:59.641
HaYes.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.571
Just let him go!

35:09.560 --> 35:13.929
They wanna throw you overboard,
they'll have to throw me first.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.525
And Lesley.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.406
Fergus.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.046
Even Willoughby.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.163
Get back. I have to do it.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.844
Anyway, if you do jump...

35:38.040 --> 35:39.405
Well...

35:40.680 --> 35:42.205
I would have to go in after you.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.371
If you make me do that, then,

35:45.200 --> 35:46.770
ye ken,
my wife will kill the both of us.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.090
I'll not let harm befall you.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.641
Come.

35:57.680 --> 35:58.920
You have my word.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.600
There he goes.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.441
Aye.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.045
- Hold on!
- Mac Dubh!

36:37.880 --> 36:39.120
To hell with it.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.361
Good lad, HaYes.

37:05.840 --> 37:06.841
Jonah!

37:07.480 --> 37:08.970
- Give him to the sea!
- Throw him in!

37:09.080 --> 37:10.491
You will do no such thing!

37:10.560 --> 37:12.927
He's the Jonah.
Over the side with him!

37:13.160 --> 37:18.724
- Jonah! Jonah!
- Jonah! Jonah!

37:18.840 --> 37:20.444
There is no Jonah!

37:21.280 --> 37:23.567
Stand aside!
I'll take some of you with me.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.530
Spare us, Chinaman.

37:37.240 --> 37:42.121
I was born Yi Tien Cho in Guangzhou,

37:42.600 --> 37:44.682
the City of Rams.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.443
I was found early

37:47.720 --> 37:49.848
to have skill in composition

37:50.320 --> 37:52.482
to make the images of my brush

37:52.560 --> 37:56.770
resemble the ideas that dance
like cranes within my mind.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.368
I became known as the fung-wong,

38:01.440 --> 38:03.522
a bird of fire.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.931
What's he on about?

38:05.000 --> 38:10.962
My poetry came
before the eYes of Wan-Mei,

38:11.200 --> 38:14.283
the emperor's second wife.

38:15.040 --> 38:19.568
She asked that I
join her household in Pekin,

38:20.160 --> 38:21.889
the Imperial city.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.008
Mr Willoughby, stand down.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.764
Let the man speak.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.321
Captain.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.883
It was a great honour,

38:37.840 --> 38:40.810
my name inscribed
in the book of merit.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.725
But there is a condition.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.210
All servants of the royal wives

38:48.160 --> 38:52.290
must be eunuchs.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.602
- What's a eunuch?
- I'll tell you later.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.730
It was most dishonourable
to refuse the Emperor's gift.

39:04.440 --> 39:09.401
It was a death sentence.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.531
And yet,

39:13.840 --> 39:16.605
I had fallen in love

39:18.040 --> 39:19.166
with

39:21.080 --> 39:22.127
woman.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.451
- The emperor's wife?
- Not a woman.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.803
All women.

39:29.560 --> 39:33.246
Their beauty blooming
like lotus flowers,

39:33.320 --> 39:37.211
the taste of their breasts
like apricots,

39:37.280 --> 39:40.090
the scent of a navel in the winter,

39:40.960 --> 39:47.730
the warmth of a mound
that fills your hand like ripe peach...

39:52.680 --> 39:54.284
I fled

39:56.240 --> 39:58.925
on the night of the lanterns.

40:00.360 --> 40:03.523
As the fireworks
shot from the palace roof,

40:04.600 --> 40:06.170
I left my house

40:07.280 --> 40:12.127
and came to a place
where the golden words of my poems

40:12.200 --> 40:15.044
are taken as the clucking of hens,

40:15.200 --> 40:17.851
and my brush strokes
for their scratchings.

40:18.280 --> 40:21.011
For the love of woman,
I am come to a place

40:21.080 --> 40:22.923
where no woman is worthy of love.

40:23.280 --> 40:27.171
To a place where women are coarse
and rank as bears,

40:27.240 --> 40:31.962
creatures of no grace, and these women
disdain me as a yellow worm

40:32.040 --> 40:35.806
so that even the lowest of whores
will not lie with me?

40:48.120 --> 40:53.763
By not surrendering my manhood,

40:55.840 --> 40:57.649
I have lost all else.

40:59.320 --> 41:05.282
Honour, livelihood, country.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.844
Sometimes,

41:11.480 --> 41:13.323
I think,

41:17.240 --> 41:18.730
"Not worth it."

41:44.600 --> 41:46.728
We have wind!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.370
Man the sheets, lads!

41:49.440 --> 41:50.646
Aloft, topmen!

41:50.720 --> 41:52.290
Lay out and loose the fore tops'l!

41:52.360 --> 41:53.725
Man halyards and sheets.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.210
Hold the wind!

41:56.280 --> 41:57.566
All of the wind!

42:00.000 --> 42:01.286
Mr Warren!

42:02.640 --> 42:04.608
Your story, it was...

42:06.640 --> 42:09.007
Well, I've heard worse.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.166
How did you know?

42:14.880 --> 42:16.882
When the seon tin jung

42:17.720 --> 42:20.087
fly high, it mean that air light.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.011
Dry, no rain.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.250
When they fly low, it means...

42:26.320 --> 42:27.526
The air is heavy.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.880
Rain is coming.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.526
Yi Tien Cho.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.926
Thank you.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.810
Make haste! All hands quicker!

42:57.880 --> 42:59.211
All hands aboard!

43:46.640 --> 43:47.926
- Hurry up.
- Aye.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.082
God, it's so hot in here,
I'm melting.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.804
I'm melting wi' ye.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.048
Someone is going to hear us.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.681
Let them.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.651
I like the grey.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.171
The way the light hits it.

44:33.800 --> 44:37.247
Like a piece of silver moonlight.

44:40.120 --> 44:43.363
How could I not love a man
who says such things?

44:46.120 --> 44:48.851
If you were to say that
in the 20th century,

44:48.920 --> 44:51.082
you'd be the king of all men.

45:01.760 --> 45:04.684
You know, when I thought about
coming back here...

45:08.040 --> 45:11.044
I knew we'd have
to get used to each other again.

45:14.840 --> 45:18.890
No matter what troubles happen
around us, Sassenach,

45:22.000 --> 45:23.126
this,

45:24.320 --> 45:26.004
what it is between us,

45:27.400 --> 45:28.606
never changes.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.601
It doesn't.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.202
Captain. What is it?

45:50.680 --> 45:52.045
British Man-of-War.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.762
Been on our stern for
more than five hours.

45:54.840 --> 45:55.966
And closing.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.045
They're firing at us.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.406
No, signalling.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.081
They want us to heave to.
They need to board us.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.201
Damn!

46:08.320 --> 46:10.687
You can see from her rigging,
they're shorthanded.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.365
They may need men.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.604
Return the salute and heave to.

46:15.680 --> 46:17.205
Aye, Captain. Return the salute.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.691
Heave tip to windward!

46:21.240 --> 46:22.924
What does he mean, "need men"?

46:23.480 --> 46:26.848
By law, they can press
any British subjects into service.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.485
That's over half the crew...

46:30.120 --> 46:31.485
Including you.

46:31.760 --> 46:32.761
Aye.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.406
If they do take me,

46:36.360 --> 46:39.921
you must continue on to Jamaica
and find Young Ian.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.490
Right. You have my word.

47:04.560 --> 47:08.201
I am Captain Thomas Leonard,
of his Majesty's ship, the Porpoise.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.965
You're the captain?

47:10.040 --> 47:12.441
Acting captain. Formerly third lieutenant.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.571
For the love of God,
have you a surgeon on board?

47:20.320 --> 47:22.766
We suffered an outbreak
of infectious plague.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.650
Ship's fever.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.484
I'm the Artemis' surgeon.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.006
It's imperative that you do not
touch anyone while on board.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.525
You should not have come here.

47:30.600 --> 47:32.250
I had no choice, madam.

47:33.280 --> 47:35.487
The captain and the two
senior lieutenants died.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.008
As well as the surgeon
and the surgeon's mate.

47:40.120 --> 47:44.887
Of our 400-man crew, 100 have fallen ill,
and 80 have departed this Earth.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.561
Are you experiencing
any symptoms yourself?

47:48.640 --> 47:51.405
- Thankfully, no.
- Are you here to press men, sir?

47:51.480 --> 47:53.562
The last thing I need
is more mouths to feed.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.727
But if you can provide
any medical assistance...

47:56.800 --> 47:57.801
Yes.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.008
What symptoms are the men experiencing?

48:00.600 --> 48:04.161
It starts with griping pains
in the belly and terrible vomiting.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.890
The afflicted complain of fever.

48:05.960 --> 48:08.406
Do they also
have a rash on their stomachs?

48:08.800 --> 48:09.926
Yes.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.527
And most of them have the blazing shits.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.285
I beg your pardon, madam.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.887
I know what it might be, but I'll need
to examine them first to be certain.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.365
Might you come over, then?

48:20.440 --> 48:21.646
- Yes, of course.
- No.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.122
Excuse us, gentlemen.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.726
Are you mad?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.962
You can't set foot
on a ship with the plague.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.889
It's typhoid fever.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.610
You mean, typhus?

48:52.680 --> 48:55.286
No, well, not what you mean by it anyway.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.488
It's something you don't know about yet.

48:58.360 --> 49:01.443
They won't know how to stop it,
but I can show them what to do.

49:02.280 --> 49:05.090
I can't catch it.
I've been inoculated.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.721
Jamie, I have an obligation to help.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.889
I swore an oath
when I became a doctor.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.001
I've taken an oath now and then, myself.

49:18.920 --> 49:20.251
And none of them lightly.

49:22.480 --> 49:26.246
There's no talking you
out of this, is there, Sassenach?

49:28.480 --> 49:31.131
It seems you are both
older and wiser.

49:32.400 --> 49:33.606
Yeah.

49:33.960 --> 49:36.850
I won't take my eYes
off that ship until you return.

50:24.600 --> 50:25.726
All hands are aft!

50:36.320 --> 50:37.526
The sick are down below.

51:09.200 --> 51:10.201
Ma'am.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.326
Put your light over there.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.970
May I look at your stomach?

52:06.600 --> 52:07.761
Yes, ma'am.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.321
Thank you.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.890
It's called typhoid.

52:38.320 --> 52:40.129
Our surgeon said
it was ship's fever.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.440
It's similar,

52:41.520 --> 52:43.727
but how you contain it is different.

52:43.920 --> 52:46.287
And you know how to do that?
How to contain it.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.761
Yes.

52:47.920 --> 52:50.924
The sick men need to be washed and laid
somewhere they can breathe fresh air.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.525
And they'll need a liquid diet.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.284
Lots of boiled water.

52:54.480 --> 52:57.643
And you'll need to reach land
as quickly as possible.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.082
You're likely
to run out of drinking water.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.410
Most of the sick will die.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.205
A lucky few won't.

53:07.240 --> 53:09.481
The hope is
that you contain the spread.

53:10.880 --> 53:12.484
You need to prepare yourself.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.761
It's going to get a lot worse
before it gets better.

53:18.600 --> 53:21.524
If you want, I'd be willing
to stay for a short while.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.329
To help you organise yourselves.

53:24.760 --> 53:27.730
I shall be eternally grateful
for any assistance you can render us.

53:28.800 --> 53:31.804
I'll need a dozen
of your healthiest crewmen.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.411
Mr Pound.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.605
You can start with Mr Pound.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.327
Hello. I'm Claire Fraser.

53:46.480 --> 53:47.970
Mistress Fraser is a surgeon.

53:48.200 --> 53:51.124
Shes acting under my personal authority.
See she gets whatever she needs.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.247
Yes, sir.

53:52.400 --> 53:55.324
The main deck will need to be cleared
so we can bring the sick men above.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.209
- Can you see to it?
- Of course, madam.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.486
I will work fast.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.484
Captain Raines will be anxious
to get on his way, as will my husband.

54:07.560 --> 54:09.881
I shall alert them
you'll be a little while longer.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.646
Which way to the galley?

54:12.720 --> 54:14.131
Mr Brisker will escort you.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.520
I'll need boiled water.
Lots of it.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.121
I'm in the middle
of preparing the Captain's meal.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.486
This is on the Captain's orders.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.731
Why are we moving?

54:50.520 --> 54:52.284
Lay aloft and set the fall across!

54:52.520 --> 54:53.885
Haul where the stakes will have it.

54:53.960 --> 54:55.450
Let go clew garnets!

54:55.560 --> 54:56.846
What are you doing?

54:56.920 --> 54:58.524
I'm in urgent need of your services.

54:59.480 --> 55:01.687
Turn back at once.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.524
You said yourself,
we must make haste.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.887
Well, you can't just kidnap me like this.

55:05.960 --> 55:07.644
The truth is, I am desperate.

55:08.280 --> 55:10.647
You may be our only chance.
I must take it.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.129
Both our ships are sailing to Jamaica.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.687
I've had a message conveyed
to Captain Raines and promised him

55:15.760 --> 55:17.842
that His Majesty's navy will provide
accommodation for you

55:17.960 --> 55:19.689
until you are able
to rejoin the Artemis.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.883
Let go. Get the tack on board.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.086
Haul out the sheet.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.321
Aye aye, sir!

55:27.600 --> 55:30.080
Madam, we're ready to move the men.
