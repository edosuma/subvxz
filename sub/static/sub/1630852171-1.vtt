WEBVTT

00:19.719 --> 00:20.742
Give me that!

00:20.827 --> 00:21.728
No!

00:21.791 --> 00:22.624
Come on!

00:24.751 --> 00:26.431
It's gonna cost you.

00:34.603 --> 00:35.803
I've got it.

00:35.888 --> 00:37.638
Happy one year, babe!

00:37.986 --> 00:39.743
I love it.

01:01.072 --> 01:03.915
I can't believe you made
this. This is delicious.

01:03.955 --> 01:05.455
I'm made to it.

01:12.049 --> 01:14.249
I'm gonna clean it up. I'll be back.

01:14.334 --> 01:15.323
It's okey, babe!

01:35.393 --> 01:37.299
Will you marry me?

01:37.870 --> 01:39.432
Yes!

01:39.643 --> 01:40.737
Yes!

01:54.444 --> 01:55.487
Our house!

01:57.064 --> 01:58.438
To our new house!

02:07.521 --> 02:09.677
I've got the job!

02:10.642 --> 02:11.922
Congratulations!

02:12.006 --> 02:13.006
Thank you!

02:55.337 --> 02:56.680
What the fuck is that?

02:56.764 --> 02:59.834
This is our biggest event.
You can't go say that.

03:02.076 --> 03:03.553
What are you doing?

03:03.638 --> 03:05.254
Relax! It was an accident.

03:05.389 --> 03:07.661
- This is our new carpet.
- I know it.

03:07.775 --> 03:09.571
Every time! You wait all day.

03:09.656 --> 03:12.148
Am I invisible when I wanna talk to you?!

03:23.736 --> 03:28.061
Canâ€™t make it tonight. Working
late... Sorry. Happy Anniversary.

04:18.157 --> 04:20.633
So... when did you leave the North Herald?

04:20.788 --> 04:23.315
To be honest I haven't really left yet.

04:25.717 --> 04:27.077
Well, I like honesty.

04:27.163 --> 04:30.464
And you've been writing the
travel section for how long?

04:30.670 --> 04:33.636
I haven't been writing
that exact column but I

04:33.720 --> 04:36.686
do have my own blog
and 14 000 weekly readers.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.061
Okay.

04:39.085 --> 04:40.436
Look...

04:41.327 --> 04:42.475
Mia, I like you.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.032
You're obviously a very smart young woman.

04:45.117 --> 04:48.381
But I have to tell you the
competition here is fierce.

04:48.916 --> 04:51.392
We have hundreds of interviews and...

04:51.477 --> 04:54.145
travel writers with over
14 years experience.

04:54.349 --> 04:55.319
It's tough.

04:55.631 --> 04:56.467
I know.

04:56.592 --> 04:58.835
I know but I think a fresh perspective

04:59.265 --> 05:00.208
will be good.

05:00.932 --> 05:03.516
I've been wanting to work here for so long

05:03.601 --> 05:06.520
and I think it would
be a great fit if you just...

05:06.611 --> 05:07.999
gave me a chance.

05:08.984 --> 05:10.606
Let me look at this.

05:10.694 --> 05:11.952
We'll get back here.

05:12.493 --> 05:13.336
Okay.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.570
Thank you.

05:26.215 --> 05:27.624
Hey!

05:29.717 --> 05:30.682
Hey!

05:31.463 --> 05:33.971
So I had that job interview today.

05:34.374 --> 05:37.151
My journalism dream
is pretty much crushed.

05:37.289 --> 05:39.987
Maybe I'll just go work at a box factory.

05:46.718 --> 05:47.848
Hello?

05:48.600 --> 05:50.248
Hey, sorry!

05:50.350 --> 05:52.154
Yeah, that really sucks.

05:55.082 --> 05:57.176
Do you want to do something today?

05:57.661 --> 05:58.727
What?

05:58.812 --> 06:02.286
You wanna do something
today? I haven't seen you in a while.

06:02.371 --> 06:03.283
Yes, sure.

06:03.368 --> 06:05.915
Wanna watch TV or
something? I'm exhausted.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.851
Okay.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.061
What do you wanna watch?

06:09.272 --> 06:10.721
Doesn't matter.

06:11.255 --> 06:12.515
Dave Curb?

06:13.251 --> 06:14.875
I hate that guy.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.734
Comedy or...

06:16.819 --> 06:20.461
I don't know, my brain's fried.
Can you just choose something?

06:22.718 --> 06:25.327
Okay, "Seinfeld" it is.

06:25.547 --> 06:28.211
So you Choose another
show with Larry David?

06:28.437 --> 06:30.586
What's your beef with Larry David?

06:31.281 --> 06:34.031
I'm just gonna go work
out and then go to bed.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.711
Fine.

06:36.335 --> 06:37.312
Wait!

06:38.914 --> 06:42.406
Can you help me to pick some
sod for the backyard tomorrow?

06:42.506 --> 06:45.450
Maybe on the weekend?
I've got a really busy week.

06:45.535 --> 06:49.805
The sod place is right by the doctor's
office and I have an appointment.

06:49.890 --> 06:53.962
So I thought maybe we could grab
some dinner and make a night out of.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.139
Come on!

06:56.950 --> 06:58.881
Fine!

07:00.201 --> 07:01.787
Thank you!

07:12.064 --> 07:13.643
Okay. All right.

07:14.065 --> 07:15.104
Take a break.

07:15.284 --> 07:16.268
Damn!

07:23.324 --> 07:24.409
Easy now, man!

07:24.493 --> 07:27.458
Big sweaty black man and
a raging dude in a hoodie

07:27.543 --> 07:31.181
in a field at 10 p.m, can't just
stare down a woman like that.

07:31.270 --> 07:32.575
She'll mace your ass.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.533
Yeah, well...

07:33.618 --> 07:36.127
Soon we'll be back in the gym listening to

07:36.212 --> 07:38.517
the groans of steroid-induced gym rats.

07:38.602 --> 07:39.875
Yeah, fair enough.

07:43.710 --> 07:44.703
You're good?

07:45.234 --> 07:47.758
Where are you man? You're not here today.

07:51.333 --> 07:55.574
You think we're built to be with
one person for the rest of our life?

07:56.562 --> 08:00.669
You do realize, you're the best
man at my wedding in April, right?

08:01.653 --> 08:02.770
I know but...

08:02.981 --> 08:03.942
Come on!

08:04.027 --> 08:05.829
You haven't thought about it?

08:05.910 --> 08:09.212
Camilla's gonna make
you happy for the rest of your life?

08:09.379 --> 08:10.871
Yeah, I do, cowboy.

08:10.956 --> 08:15.429
Otherwise wouldn't have just spent half
my salary from last year on a ring.

08:17.848 --> 08:20.746
Things between you two
are not any better at all?

08:22.260 --> 08:23.223
I love her.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.958
She's family. It's just I'm...

08:27.286 --> 08:30.606
You know, sometimes I
see a girl walk by and I think...

08:30.691 --> 08:32.832
Maybe that girl will make me happy?

08:32.917 --> 08:33.834
Okay, so...

08:33.919 --> 08:35.230
Why don't you just...

08:35.315 --> 08:36.634
Both of you, you know.

08:36.719 --> 08:39.526
Freak your shit out a little
bit, get a swing.

08:39.610 --> 08:42.516
You've got to work,
to keep these things alive.

08:42.601 --> 08:44.549
It's not that Ben, it's...

08:44.634 --> 08:46.828
We've been together since High school.

08:46.913 --> 08:48.697
There's nothing there anymore.

08:49.949 --> 08:52.056
You're gonna try to work it out?

08:55.468 --> 08:57.314
I think I'm at the end, man.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.852
I've been trying for two years.

09:02.391 --> 09:04.454
I gotta have that talk with her.

09:04.726 --> 09:06.461
Look, divorce is expensive.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.345
She's gonna take half
of your shit. All right?

09:09.437 --> 09:12.477
I thought you wanted to
branch out from Aphid Blue.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.662
Reboot that whole business startup.

09:15.203 --> 09:17.951
How are you going to do
that without any money?

09:19.797 --> 09:21.469
Right? You can't.

09:23.453 --> 09:24.756
Let's go!

09:54.827 --> 09:57.265
I need to talk to you about something.

09:58.189 --> 09:59.320
Now?

10:01.016 --> 10:03.336
We can't yell at each other here.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.555
Can't we talk about it later?

10:06.896 --> 10:09.122
No, we've got to talk about it now.

10:09.207 --> 10:10.407
Mia Griffon!

10:12.860 --> 10:14.761
I'm gonna wait outside, Mia.

10:14.846 --> 10:17.504
No, come on! it's just
gonna be five minutes.

10:17.589 --> 10:19.207
Come with me!

10:22.707 --> 10:23.950
Thanks for coming in.

10:24.929 --> 10:27.956
We've got your blood work
back and found something

10:28.040 --> 10:30.787
troubling which is
why I called you back in

10:31.003 --> 10:31.989
Okay.

10:32.170 --> 10:33.862
The upper abdominal pain

10:33.947 --> 10:36.144
in the left quadrant and the jaundice

10:36.229 --> 10:39.353
you've been experiencing
is because we found a mass.

10:40.325 --> 10:42.302
And you have pancreatic cancer.

10:43.719 --> 10:44.943
Cancer?

10:48.228 --> 10:49.420
Are you sure?

10:50.115 --> 10:51.007
Yes.

10:51.279 --> 10:54.443
It's fast moving, I recommend
treatment immediately.

10:55.359 --> 10:57.716
Now we can talk about all the options.

10:57.834 --> 11:00.857
I understand if you need
a few moments to process.

11:03.381 --> 11:06.388
I think we're gonna need
more than a few moments.

11:09.946 --> 11:11.529
Am I gonna live?

11:12.743 --> 11:15.279
There's a small chance
if you do treatment.

11:16.703 --> 11:19.607
If not I would say you have around... two
months.

11:51.286 --> 11:53.162
Stop the car!

12:31.186 --> 12:32.019
Mia!

12:36.123 --> 12:38.287
Will you look at me? Please, Mia.

12:39.922 --> 12:41.724
I can't look at you.

12:44.151 --> 12:46.313
You don't ever look at me anymore.

12:55.281 --> 12:56.929
You could fight this.

13:06.604 --> 13:08.151
We can't stay here.

13:29.789 --> 13:31.026
So...

13:33.922 --> 13:35.815
What do you want to do, Mia?

13:42.948 --> 13:44.941
We need to talk about this, okay?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.808
We need
to come up with a plan.

13:47.234 --> 13:49.010
Don't want to talk about it.

13:49.548 --> 13:51.284
Just need
some time.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.571
Can we fast forward to a time when you can
talk about it?

13:55.655 --> 13:57.870
Because time is of the essence here.

14:00.439 --> 14:01.836
What a waste.

14:01.921 --> 14:02.989
What?

14:03.782 --> 14:06.376
This is my life. This is all I get?

14:07.908 --> 14:09.318
It's not fair.

14:09.403 --> 14:13.819
But if you start chemo right away, the
doctor said, there could be a chance.

14:13.927 --> 14:15.706
No, they just say that, Liam.

14:15.791 --> 14:17.509
You gotta at
least try.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.196
Well, what do you wanna do, Mia?

14:20.407 --> 14:22.665
We're running out of options here.

14:24.900 --> 14:29.393
Your parents are coming on Wednesday,
maybe they can talk some sense in you.

14:29.478 --> 14:32.471
- You called my parents?
- They're your parents.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.517
I can't face my dad right now.

14:34.611 --> 14:36.936
Okay, I'm just trying to help you, Mia.

14:37.107 --> 14:40.969
My dad is gonna tie me to a chair
and force a bloody iv in my arm.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.435
You're overreacting.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.948
You're unbelievable.

14:44.033 --> 14:47.811
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life rotting in a hospital.

14:47.896 --> 14:49.492
You're not thinking clear.

14:49.577 --> 14:51.156
Yes, I am.

14:51.278 --> 14:52.700
You know what?

14:52.785 --> 14:54.142
I hate my job.

14:55.243 --> 14:56.800
Quit with me!

14:57.057 --> 14:59.190
Mia, I can't just quit my job.

14:59.489 --> 15:01.081
Yes, you can.

15:02.338 --> 15:05.737
They demoted you and you worked so hard
for this company.

15:06.412 --> 15:09.368
You wanted to be an entrepreneur forever.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.643
We've got our savings.

15:14.166 --> 15:17.339
Okay, can we can we rewind things here,
for a second?

15:17.558 --> 15:19.031
Do you want to live, Mia?

15:19.248 --> 15:22.313
Do you want to try?
Do you want to try to live, Mia?

15:22.398 --> 15:23.412
Yes, I do.

15:23.512 --> 15:25.003
I want to live for once.

15:25.088 --> 15:27.593
I want to travel the
country, I want to see

15:27.678 --> 15:30.363
the animals and live
in nature. That's living.

15:30.448 --> 15:35.116
Not working some job I hate for the next
50 years, even if I beat this thing.

15:35.580 --> 15:39.602
There's a slim chance I'll live, even if
I go through the treatment.

15:39.815 --> 15:43.358
Do you honestly want to spend the
potential last days with me

15:43.443 --> 15:44.970
in a depressing hospital?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.800
If you loved me at
all, you would see that.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.409
I support you.

16:05.843 --> 16:07.159
Fine.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.793
I'll quit my job.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.191
We'll go on the road.

16:22.390 --> 16:23.649
Thank you.

16:40.275 --> 16:45.355
All right, can I have
everyone's attention, please?

16:46.314 --> 16:50.728
I want to say something that I've
wanted to say for a really long time.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.311
Todd, I'm gonna start with you.

16:54.395 --> 16:57.514
You are
the coolest guy ever.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.584
And Cindy...

16:59.840 --> 17:00.849
you're sweet.

17:00.934 --> 17:04.308
But nobody cares
about your cat.

17:04.536 --> 17:07.619
And what it did last
weekend, or yesterday, or

17:07.703 --> 17:10.786
today as you're watching
it on a live cat camp

17:11.392 --> 17:12.841
So please!

17:13.153 --> 17:14.352
Put it away.

17:14.849 --> 17:16.653
I still love you though.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.536
And... Rico...

17:20.391 --> 17:22.721
You are so talented.

17:22.812 --> 17:26.058
And so are you Katie, and you guys,
inspire me

17:26.142 --> 17:28.623
to be a better writer every day.

17:30.242 --> 17:31.365
Steve!

17:32.701 --> 17:34.117
Fuck you!

17:34.827 --> 17:38.104
And Jimmy... a double fuck you!

17:38.210 --> 17:40.758
For not paying your
employees for overtime.

17:40.939 --> 17:44.897
I am done working my butt
off, just for you to yell at me.

17:44.982 --> 17:46.492
I write brilliant stuff.

17:46.576 --> 17:47.788
And I deserve more.

17:47.873 --> 17:49.477
And you
should see that.

17:49.561 --> 17:52.023
Also I am done with your sexual advances.

17:52.131 --> 17:54.364
It's called workplace harassment.

17:54.448 --> 17:58.526
So I either report you now, or I'm
gonna take my overtime paying cash

17:58.995 --> 18:00.781
And... I quit.

18:00.995 --> 18:03.510
If that wasn't obvious enough.

18:13.646 --> 18:16.958
You have to return...
the pass to the building right now.

18:17.482 --> 18:18.401
Yeah.

18:18.602 --> 18:21.083
One second, almost got it.

18:22.895 --> 18:24.482
There it is.

18:28.474 --> 18:29.458
Okay...

18:30.368 --> 18:33.005
You know, we move on,
we move on.

18:34.476 --> 18:36.341
And enough of the cats.

18:49.810 --> 18:52.349
Can I have everyone's attention for...

18:52.605 --> 18:53.627
a minute. I...

18:53.712 --> 18:55.550
What do you think you're
doing?

18:56.200 --> 18:58.310
I...

18:59.036 --> 19:03.112
wanted to wish everybody
a... safe weekend.

19:03.196 --> 19:05.591
It's... gonna be hot.

19:08.662 --> 19:10.513
Fuck sakes, Griffin!

19:17.881 --> 19:19.430
What are you doing?

19:20.536 --> 19:21.958
Working.

19:22.199 --> 19:25.810
Is that the Sawdust City Brewing
treatment on your computer?

19:25.918 --> 19:27.335
It's my job.

19:27.473 --> 19:28.930
Sawdust is my client.

19:29.204 --> 19:32.094
Yeah, well... Maybe you should suck less.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.852
You gave Darren my client?

19:43.750 --> 19:44.813
Yep!

19:44.898 --> 19:48.548
I've been working with Sawdust City for
the last four years.

19:49.827 --> 19:51.276
You gotta be kidding me!

19:51.691 --> 19:53.099
That client loved me.

19:53.207 --> 19:54.690
Did they not ask for me?

19:59.182 --> 20:00.839
Can I talk to you for a sec?

20:01.455 --> 20:04.565
It seems, unfortunately
we're already doing that.

20:05.926 --> 20:07.799
I need some time off.

20:08.678 --> 20:11.111
A month... maybe more.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.515
A month? I'm trying
to run a business here.

20:14.599 --> 20:16.962
I'm having some issues at home, I...

20:17.047 --> 20:19.382
I just need to deal with a few things.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.377
I'm sorry about that, but I
can't give you that leave.

20:24.111 --> 20:29.009
Aren't I entitled to like a mental health
day or something? Isn't that like a thing?

20:30.906 --> 20:32.077
Look...

20:33.627 --> 20:34.851
It's serious.

20:38.139 --> 20:40.274
Two weeks max.

20:41.526 --> 20:43.298
And you answer every call.

20:46.336 --> 20:47.469
Thanks.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.810
What are you doing?

20:51.895 --> 20:53.514
Raising money for our trip.

20:53.599 --> 20:55.394
You can't sell all our stuff!

20:55.479 --> 20:57.727
Ask your dad. He's like a
billionaire.

20:57.812 --> 21:00.584
Yeah right, as if he
would ever support this!

21:00.735 --> 21:02.334
Is that our couch?

21:02.867 --> 21:04.786
Okay, you can't sell our couch.

21:04.871 --> 21:07.563
We had it for years, we
don't need it anymore.

21:07.648 --> 21:09.672
Burt Reynolds? No!

21:09.757 --> 21:11.780
You hate Larry David, I hate him.

21:11.865 --> 21:13.887
Why? He's like an ancient legend.

21:13.969 --> 21:15.817
He's like an ancient douchebag.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.636
- This is ludicrous.
- This is what we needed.

21:18.721 --> 21:23.806
We don't need half of this stuff. This
posture-shocking thing that my mom gave...

21:23.890 --> 21:27.480
I don't need a shock, as if my
standing is not good enough.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.272
In fact, I actually resent it.

21:30.553 --> 21:31.847
Curb items.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.558
- Okay!
-Thank you.

21:36.637 --> 21:38.054
Estate sale?

21:38.138 --> 21:41.792
You didn't waste any time
before bringing up the divorce talk.

21:41.877 --> 21:43.791
Hey, yeah... no, actually.

21:43.876 --> 21:47.296
So you just decided to
sell every item in your house?

21:47.380 --> 21:48.219
Yep!

21:51.301 --> 21:52.337
You good?

21:53.836 --> 21:55.615
You're all
fired up, man.

21:55.699 --> 22:00.406
Yeah no there's just a lot going on,
there's a lot of people in the house.

22:00.491 --> 22:01.492
Sure, yeah.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.555
Is that it?

22:05.199 --> 22:06.438
Yeah, that's it.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.000
No...

22:11.256 --> 22:12.147
No.

22:12.303 --> 22:13.873
Actually that's...

22:14.842 --> 22:16.522
That's not it.

22:23.780 --> 22:26.811
You think Burt Reynolds is a douchebag?

22:27.221 --> 22:29.857
Burt Reynolds? No, man, he's the coolest.

22:29.941 --> 22:31.725
That's what I'm talking about.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.178
No! That's not for sale!

22:35.576 --> 22:38.051
Liam, I know, you're busy, bro, but...

22:38.135 --> 22:42.541
You're doing price match? Cause I
swear, I saw this cheaper somewhere else.

23:05.748 --> 23:07.277
Where did you get this?

23:07.361 --> 23:08.717
The RV store.

23:08.802 --> 23:12.651
Did we make enough
money from that estate sale to buy an RV?

23:12.814 --> 23:14.350
No, I sold the car.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.451
You what?

23:15.536 --> 23:18.803
This is much better. We can't
travel in that little car.

23:18.888 --> 23:20.621
Mia, no!

23:20.705 --> 23:23.069
Have you lost it? That was my car!

23:23.186 --> 23:26.434
- What am I gonna do with...
- Your bags are in the RV.

23:26.563 --> 23:28.656
Packed for you since this morning.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.311
I'm just gonna need a minute to say
"goodbye" to our house.

24:08.429 --> 24:09.420
Shoot!

24:23.022 --> 24:24.004
Mia?

24:24.287 --> 24:25.426
Dad?

24:25.662 --> 24:27.350
What are you doing?

24:29.334 --> 24:33.793
Always wanted a Romeo and
Juliet balcony off the master.

24:33.877 --> 24:35.561
The view sucks.

24:35.646 --> 24:37.467
So not worth the Reno.

24:38.131 --> 24:40.057
What are you doing here?

24:40.281 --> 24:42.597
What are you talking about?

24:42.806 --> 24:45.155
I'm devastated with this news.

24:45.647 --> 24:48.584
Now look, I don't want you to worry.

24:48.825 --> 24:54.303
I have the best oncologist in the
country that I play golf with, dr Casey.

24:54.733 --> 24:56.147
He's going to help you.

24:56.272 --> 24:57.428
He's here?

24:57.616 --> 24:58.465
Back home.

24:58.549 --> 25:01.056
Dad, it's hours away. I'm not going back.

25:01.140 --> 25:02.553
The hell, you're not!

25:02.638 --> 25:05.784
This is your life
we're talking about. You're coming!

25:06.025 --> 25:07.420
Mia, honey!

25:10.558 --> 25:11.811
Mom!

25:14.420 --> 25:15.355
I'm okay.

25:15.439 --> 25:16.506
Liam!

25:18.101 --> 25:19.092
I just...

25:19.349 --> 25:20.615
I have to...

25:21.253 --> 25:23.045
Get something out front.

25:23.544 --> 25:24.762
Liam?

25:24.873 --> 25:27.424
- Can you help me, please?
- I'll help you.

25:27.508 --> 25:30.347
Donna, why don't you start
packing me his things?

25:30.431 --> 25:31.686
I think...

25:31.771 --> 25:35.347
Mia is a little overwhelmed.
Maybe we just give her a minute?

25:35.432 --> 25:37.795
Thank you for speaking for my daughter.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.377
Roger, please!

25:39.461 --> 25:42.730
We're all just a little tense
under the circumstances.

25:55.006 --> 25:57.662
Would anybody like a cup of tea?

25:58.385 --> 25:59.412
Yeah.

26:00.982 --> 26:03.714
When, the hell, did you get the RV, by
the way?

26:23.251 --> 26:24.720
Mia, can we...

26:25.088 --> 26:26.891
Can we go back in the house?

26:28.086 --> 26:30.380
We need to forget about all of this.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.250
We need to get real here.

26:39.111 --> 26:40.350
Can you...

26:40.544 --> 26:43.441
close the door and just sit
with me for a second?

26:53.775 --> 26:55.695
Hey, what the heck you doin'?

26:56.220 --> 26:57.424
Hey!

26:58.421 --> 27:00.330
Hey, what are you doing?

27:04.101 --> 27:05.892
Didn't we buy them two chairs?

27:17.118 --> 27:19.150
Mia! They're leaving!

27:26.821 --> 27:28.314
Get your keys!

27:31.879 --> 27:33.019
Pull over!

27:33.373 --> 27:35.568
Pull over, now! Are you crazy?

27:35.691 --> 27:39.646
I'm already gonna die, but if you don't
wanna die, stop doing that.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.554
Mia, we gotta turn around.

27:41.679 --> 27:43.377
We can't run away like this.

27:43.461 --> 27:46.241
It's too late. You said,
you were on board.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.894
Yeah, not like this.

27:48.244 --> 27:51.163
You know what? I don't
know if I am anymore, okay?

27:52.181 --> 27:53.668
I just need one day.

27:53.921 --> 27:55.921
I need one day to clear my head.

27:56.272 --> 27:58.077
And then we'll go back.

28:01.584 --> 28:03.288
Jesus, Mia!

28:06.120 --> 28:08.032
Fine! One day!

28:08.117 --> 28:10.558
Then we go back and talk to your parents.

28:10.643 --> 28:11.968
I'm serious!

28:14.161 --> 28:16.952
You're gonna tell me
where we're going, anyway?

28:54.726 --> 28:56.239
Can you help me?

28:56.350 --> 28:57.860
What are you doing?

28:57.960 --> 28:58.983
Going for a ride.

28:59.068 --> 29:01.262
You can't just steal someone's canoe.

29:01.347 --> 29:04.125
I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing. Come on!

29:05.103 --> 29:06.562
Don't be a wuss!

29:09.494 --> 29:11.583
Hold on! Okay!

29:18.666 --> 29:19.957
All right!

29:35.455 --> 29:36.640
What?

29:38.275 --> 29:40.000
This is so stupid!

29:40.650 --> 29:41.804
What is?

29:41.888 --> 29:43.963
That we've never done this before.

29:44.344 --> 29:46.057
It's so simple.

29:46.342 --> 29:48.850
It's not like we haven't talked about it.

29:48.935 --> 29:50.698
Yeah, I know, but...

29:50.814 --> 29:52.778
It means nothing until you do it.

29:52.863 --> 29:57.362
How many nights did we waste, sitting
on the couch watching mindless dribble?

29:57.599 --> 30:00.487
All we had to do, was
jump in the car and drive.

30:02.288 --> 30:04.526
We wasted so much time.

30:05.776 --> 30:08.393
I wish, I quit my job two years ago.

30:09.884 --> 30:12.024
I'm never gonna get that time back.

30:13.049 --> 30:16.471
So liberating telling
Jimmy to go himself.

30:16.908 --> 30:18.929
You told him to fuck himself?

30:19.185 --> 30:20.440
Yeah.

30:22.708 --> 30:23.666
Wait...

30:23.853 --> 30:27.581
How did your quitting experience go?
You never told me about it.

30:30.642 --> 30:31.940
Well...

30:34.502 --> 30:35.877
I didn't...

30:37.533 --> 30:40.002
I didn't tell Jerry to go fuck himself.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.588
I told him to

30:41.673 --> 30:44.366
shove his new management
portfolio up his ass.

30:44.451 --> 30:45.284
Yes!

30:50.386 --> 30:51.868
Liam, how does it feel?

30:52.261 --> 30:54.257
We're not tied down by anyone.

30:54.341 --> 30:56.464
We don't have to listen to anybody.

30:56.549 --> 30:57.815
We're free.

30:58.434 --> 31:00.849
Now you can focus on your startup again.

31:00.934 --> 31:03.975
I don't even know, why
you gave it up to begin with.

31:04.106 --> 31:05.625
You were doing so good.

31:05.710 --> 31:07.185
I wasn't doing
that good.

31:07.270 --> 31:08.573
Yes, you were.

31:12.042 --> 31:13.047
Thanks.

31:13.362 --> 31:15.729
No... thank you!

31:17.221 --> 31:18.414
For...

31:18.499 --> 31:20.926
I didn't think you would actually quit.

31:23.443 --> 31:24.800
Means a lot to me.

31:32.233 --> 31:33.706
Oh no!

31:36.791 --> 31:38.581
My donkey charm is gone!

31:40.784 --> 31:41.696
It's okay.

31:41.780 --> 31:43.057
No, it's not!

31:43.878 --> 31:48.202
I bought you so much jewelry, you
care about some cheap donkey charm.

31:48.341 --> 31:51.151
Yeah, but I love donkeys.

31:53.828 --> 31:57.304
Whatever! It's not like you can take it
with you, anyway.

32:04.176 --> 32:05.114
I...

32:05.745 --> 32:08.097
I think someone wants their canoe back.

32:43.221 --> 32:45.425
Who's calling this early?

32:47.432 --> 32:49.237
It's just my alarm.

32:51.634 --> 32:53.667
Why do you have an alarm?

32:54.956 --> 32:56.604
Let's not waste any time.

32:56.743 --> 33:00.979
Okay, well I'm not exactly trying
to rush back to my parents, so...

33:02.815 --> 33:05.056
We've got a pit stop to make.

33:05.140 --> 33:06.612
It's a surprise.

33:57.701 --> 33:58.602
Okay.

34:00.010 --> 34:01.635
What are we doing?

34:01.760 --> 34:03.268
Come on, you'll see!

34:08.354 --> 34:09.440
No!

34:10.101 --> 34:11.401
Oh my god!

34:17.377 --> 34:18.581
Hi!

34:19.527 --> 34:20.589
Hey!

34:22.551 --> 34:24.026
Hey, buddy!

34:31.249 --> 34:32.472
Are you crying?

34:39.141 --> 34:40.550
This is so awesome!

35:44.537 --> 35:46.402
Liam, do you know where the...

35:46.579 --> 35:48.310
Never mind!

35:53.342 --> 35:54.863
Someone is calling you.

35:54.947 --> 35:55.816
It's okay.

35:56.506 --> 35:57.967
It's my parents.

35:58.216 --> 36:00.517
Why is your work calling off the hook?

36:00.602 --> 36:01.878
I thought you quit.

36:02.101 --> 36:04.942
Probably just want to
talk about my severance...

36:05.032 --> 36:09.410
I don't know any business, that is
this desperate to give away their money.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.550
What is your problem?

36:12.634 --> 36:13.584
Nothing.

36:13.860 --> 36:15.075
Whatever, Nixon.

36:15.169 --> 36:17.715
What are you hiding? Give me your phone!

36:17.800 --> 36:18.943
- Nothing!
- What?!

36:19.028 --> 36:20.817
Stop it! Give it give it back!

36:20.901 --> 36:23.217
- Give me your...
- Mia, I'm driving!

36:23.301 --> 36:24.381
Stop it!

36:24.803 --> 36:27.295
Mia! Forget it. I'm pulling over.

36:27.678 --> 36:28.878
Forget this!

36:37.443 --> 36:39.534
What are you hiding on your phone?

36:39.618 --> 36:40.576
Nothing!

36:42.529 --> 36:47.326
Mia, we need to talk. We need to come up
with an excuse for running off like that.

36:47.411 --> 36:48.817
Why do you care?

36:48.901 --> 36:51.168
I'm trying to do damage control here.

36:51.223 --> 36:54.232
We ran off,
we ignored their texts, their calls...

36:54.317 --> 36:57.153
I don't want you to be
stressed when we go back.

36:57.238 --> 36:59.486
- Then let's not go back.
- Mia!

36:59.599 --> 37:01.896
Last night, today it was...

37:02.167 --> 37:05.248
It was fun, carefree and it was
beautiful.

37:05.333 --> 37:08.017
- And I want more of that.
- Then let's do it!

37:08.101 --> 37:09.897
You're overlooking treatment.

37:09.982 --> 37:12.896
- If you're trying to...
- Mia, we're going home!

37:12.981 --> 37:14.263
You promised!

37:17.672 --> 37:19.229
I'm trying to protect you!

37:19.314 --> 37:20.481
Then protect me!

37:21.168 --> 37:23.564
Setting me back is like a jail sentence.

37:23.726 --> 37:25.537
Worse! A death sentence!

37:28.505 --> 37:30.615
Do you remember our honeymoon?

37:32.230 --> 37:34.448
Yeah. it rained nine out of ten days.

37:34.533 --> 37:37.896
Okay, do you remember the
first year we dated in grade 10?

37:37.981 --> 37:39.657
At the drive-in, it rained.

37:39.742 --> 37:43.267
At the fireworks, it rained.
On a walk through the park too.

37:43.352 --> 37:46.697
Some bad weather didn't stop you
from getting to know me.

37:46.793 --> 37:50.213
It didn't stop us from finding
new ways to love each other!

37:50.756 --> 37:52.286
On our honeymoon...

37:53.037 --> 37:56.404
We ordered room service
and watched tv and had...

37:56.897 --> 37:58.388
okay sex.

38:00.539 --> 38:05.355
The first year of dating felt more like a
honeymoon than our actual honeymoon did.

38:05.920 --> 38:10.157
I feel cheated. I feel like I never
really had a real honeymoon with you!

38:18.967 --> 38:20.620
I just need a few minutes.

38:20.810 --> 38:21.840
Great!

39:12.166 --> 39:14.163
Liam, can we just, please, talk?

39:20.341 --> 39:22.399
I guess I owe you a honeymoon.

39:26.482 --> 39:28.031
Thank you.

39:52.512 --> 39:55.078
Look out! There're snakes all over here.

39:57.165 --> 39:58.461
What else?

40:03.673 --> 40:05.423
You're actually good!

40:05.656 --> 40:07.024
I wasn't ready!

40:07.109 --> 40:08.609
I said "Ready ?".

40:08.867 --> 40:10.648
And you said "Yep".

40:35.157 --> 40:36.937
Where are we?

40:41.017 --> 40:42.697
Somewhere here...

40:44.828 --> 40:45.863
Liam?

40:45.948 --> 40:46.983
Yeah?

40:47.068 --> 40:48.817
Do you know what Iâ€™m doing?

40:48.901 --> 40:51.720
- What are you doing?
- Take a look.

40:51.805 --> 40:53.702
You are opening a can of beans.

40:53.787 --> 40:55.063
For you.

41:41.781 --> 41:43.353
Babe, this way!

41:45.243 --> 41:46.203
Babe!

41:48.611 --> 41:51.048
Babe, I love you so much!

42:01.055 --> 42:02.529
Looks like me?

42:03.845 --> 42:05.025
Yeah.

42:05.549 --> 42:06.660
No brains!

42:44.661 --> 42:47.485
Shoot! Hey, did we miss our turn?

42:49.527 --> 42:51.150
I don't know.

42:53.157 --> 42:55.931
You have one job.
Look for Watertown road.

42:56.015 --> 42:57.498
Okay, can you calm down?

42:57.700 --> 42:58.790
I am calm!

43:03.006 --> 43:04.556
Can you check the map?

43:06.180 --> 43:07.780
My phone is so slow!

43:07.864 --> 43:11.005
Why are you using your phone data?
It's so expensive!

43:11.090 --> 43:12.756
Just check the map!

43:12.840 --> 43:14.629
It's gonna take two seconds!

43:14.780 --> 43:17.896
Put down your phone and check the map!

43:17.981 --> 43:19.800
I can't read the map.

43:20.316 --> 43:22.497
Who
reads paper maps anyway?

43:22.581 --> 43:24.636
It's like translating hieroglyphs.

43:24.839 --> 43:27.347
Are you kidding me? That's ridiculous!

43:27.432 --> 43:29.057
Come on! Give me the map!

43:29.141 --> 43:30.160
Fine!

43:30.377 --> 43:31.828
I can't find it.

43:31.913 --> 43:33.593
It's in there, look harder!

43:33.678 --> 43:36.365
Sorry, but I can't find
it because of all the

43:36.449 --> 43:39.135
bean cans you've been
hoarding. Who eats this?

43:39.220 --> 43:41.350
Okay, listen...

43:41.568 --> 43:44.798
They're a healthy alternative
for us being on the road.

43:44.883 --> 43:47.772
I am missing the gym for this road trip.

43:48.077 --> 43:49.889
What is that supposed to mean?

43:49.974 --> 43:51.277
Just give me the map!

43:51.362 --> 43:53.051
Stop being such a dick!

43:53.135 --> 43:54.561
Stop being such a bitch!

43:54.646 --> 43:56.417
You're being a dick right now.

43:56.501 --> 43:59.165
You're being a huge
bitch now. I'm only being

43:59.250 --> 44:01.636
a dick, because of your huge bitchiness.

44:01.744 --> 44:04.279
Oh yeah, said every guy ever.

44:04.661 --> 44:07.402
Why can't we just go
one day without fighting?

44:07.486 --> 44:08.655
You tell me!

44:09.538 --> 44:10.887
No, you tell me.

44:10.971 --> 44:13.650
All right, it's because
you're being a bitch.

44:30.864 --> 44:32.540
What're you doing?

44:34.528 --> 44:36.985
Just writing something in my notebook.

44:42.522 --> 44:45.258
Sorry for being such a dick today.

44:46.868 --> 44:49.032
I didn't mean to call you a bitch.

44:50.555 --> 44:52.453
You're not a bitch at all.

44:53.461 --> 44:55.118
I'm a bitch.

44:59.860 --> 45:01.943
Why don't you throw a sweater on?

45:02.305 --> 45:05.235
Come outside. I've got
something to show you.

45:07.692 --> 45:08.710
Okay.

45:08.794 --> 45:09.811
Okay?

45:20.101 --> 45:21.344
What is this?

45:21.429 --> 45:23.993
I thought you could
meditate here tonight.

45:35.218 --> 45:36.257
Well...

45:36.890 --> 45:38.953
Do you want to meditate with me?

45:41.241 --> 45:42.575
No, you go ahead.

45:42.659 --> 45:44.945
Come on!

45:54.261 --> 45:55.656
All right.

45:59.381 --> 46:01.513
So how does one meditate?

46:01.597 --> 46:03.476
You've never
meditated before?

46:04.180 --> 46:05.927
How do I not know this?

46:06.011 --> 46:07.953
Maybe you don't know me?

46:08.440 --> 46:10.476
Okay, well... close your eyes.

46:11.872 --> 46:14.117
And think of...

46:14.335 --> 46:15.951
Well, think of nothing.

46:16.898 --> 46:18.620
My mind's racing.

46:18.705 --> 46:19.981
Okay, relax.

46:20.261 --> 46:24.038
Beginner's version. Put
your hand on your heart.

46:26.981 --> 46:29.597
Think of something
that you're grateful for.

46:30.015 --> 46:32.290
Anything. Could be big or small.

46:32.374 --> 46:35.535
Something
that has affected your life in some way.

46:35.890 --> 46:37.512
And just be in that moment.

46:38.394 --> 46:40.066
Think of
their face.

46:40.344 --> 46:43.065
Or that thing that you're grateful for.

46:44.420 --> 46:46.540
And thank them for it.

46:59.170 --> 47:00.650
How was that?

47:22.940 --> 47:25.940
hmm

47:29.786 --> 47:32.069
You want to go for a hike?

47:36.799 --> 47:38.842
Looks like the wisdom tree.

47:39.084 --> 47:40.209
Totally.

47:40.797 --> 47:42.334
It's beautiful.

47:42.779 --> 47:45.268
Is there anything else you'd like to do...

47:45.353 --> 47:46.237
Before I
die?

47:46.326 --> 47:47.937
That's not what I meant.

47:48.021 --> 47:48.918
I know.

47:49.002 --> 47:53.170
If this was a wisdom tree, what wisdom
do you think, it would share?

47:53.255 --> 47:56.611
Last time I visited a wisdom
tree on a tree of light trail

47:56.696 --> 48:00.826
told me to get out of California
and take a summer course in Canada.

48:00.911 --> 48:02.764
I remember that summer.

48:03.819 --> 48:06.616
Never looked back or went back.

48:07.405 --> 48:08.582
Wow!

48:09.186 --> 48:10.444
It's crazy.

48:13.480 --> 48:16.725
Wise tree... What would it say now?

48:17.663 --> 48:18.615
I don't know.

48:19.170 --> 48:22.097
Maybe tell me to do
something to change the world?

48:22.381 --> 48:24.076
Which would be?

48:28.261 --> 48:30.381
I know that look...

48:34.175 --> 48:35.300
And what?

48:36.006 --> 48:37.537
Just just go with it?

48:37.621 --> 48:39.491
Let's go with it!

48:41.256 --> 48:44.420
You do know this isn't the petting
zoo kind of farm?

48:44.505 --> 48:45.748
Right?

48:47.744 --> 48:48.889
Yep!

49:00.811 --> 49:02.091
Get out of here!

49:02.639 --> 49:04.881
He just kicked a chicken! Jesus!

49:08.030 --> 49:09.428
What can I do for you?

49:09.513 --> 49:10.969
Hi, I'm Leah.

49:11.061 --> 49:15.912
I'm a student trying to get into the
farming business, and this is my teacher.

49:16.821 --> 49:20.185
I was just wondering if maybe you
could show us around?

49:20.399 --> 49:23.662
Sorry, we don't let unknown folks out
on these premises.

49:25.209 --> 49:27.389
Okay, wait... I'm Sue.

49:28.021 --> 49:30.357
I am Sue's cousin's daughter.

49:30.787 --> 49:33.326
Sue?

49:34.349 --> 49:36.178
Sue Landy, you mean?

49:37.219 --> 49:39.269
Yeah, yes, Sue Landy.

49:39.990 --> 49:41.779
She said you wouldn't mind.

49:42.956 --> 49:45.076
I guess I can give you a quick tour.

49:45.224 --> 49:47.037
Perfect! Thank you.

49:47.331 --> 49:48.896
Who's Sue Landy?

49:53.940 --> 49:56.287
This is where we house the chickens.

49:56.455 --> 49:58.940
Anywhere up of over 200 at a time.

49:59.150 --> 50:02.209
It's kind of a holding area
before we processed them.

50:03.350 --> 50:04.584
Processed?

50:16.038 --> 50:18.115
This is where we keep all the feed.

50:18.200 --> 50:21.815
We like to call it the last supper, if you
know, what I mean.

50:22.038 --> 50:24.795
I'll take you to my
favorite room, right here.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.154
Are we done? Because I'm getting sick

50:27.239 --> 50:30.037
hanging
out in this chicken concentration camp.

50:30.122 --> 50:33.899
There're two things they don't
teach in school" love and freedom.

50:38.901 --> 50:40.897
Mia, what the heck are you doing?

50:40.981 --> 50:42.737
You're crazy!

50:42.821 --> 50:46.440
What are you idiots doing? Let
me out here right now! Dang it!

50:55.779 --> 50:57.763
Go! That way!

51:13.141 --> 51:15.040
They're shooting at us!

51:19.614 --> 51:21.348
He shot me!

51:24.821 --> 51:27.075
Liam, the chicken! Get the chicken!

51:28.770 --> 51:30.698
I'm not getting the chicken!

51:30.782 --> 51:32.440
Get the chicken!

51:38.151 --> 51:39.507
Stop right there!

51:50.349 --> 51:52.888
That's for pointing a gun at my wife.

51:53.208 --> 51:57.169
That's for hitting a
chicken! You animal Hitler!

52:20.450 --> 52:21.988
So sorry!

52:23.940 --> 52:25.957
Please, don't be mad at me.

52:26.463 --> 52:28.833
I thought they
were gonna kill you, Mia.

52:28.918 --> 52:32.290
I thought they were gonna
kill you right in front of me.

52:35.375 --> 52:37.660
Can we let him go now?

52:38.504 --> 52:39.970
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

52:40.054 --> 52:42.269
- Yeah.
- Okay.

52:43.518 --> 52:44.774
All right.

52:45.769 --> 52:47.436
Come on, chicken!

52:47.521 --> 52:48.572
Be free!

52:48.709 --> 52:49.639
Come on!

52:49.749 --> 52:50.746
Be free!

52:50.831 --> 52:53.390
- Go!
- Go!

53:03.103 --> 53:04.156
Sorry!

53:05.111 --> 53:07.033
Are you gonna be okay?

53:07.616 --> 53:10.127
Yeah, it's just a flesh wound.

53:12.133 --> 53:13.768
Do you know what you want?

53:14.384 --> 53:17.314
Is it bad if I want a
chicken burger right now?

53:17.688 --> 53:18.752
Liam!

53:18.963 --> 53:20.541
I was just kidding!

53:22.119 --> 53:23.820
Know what you'd like?

53:23.904 --> 53:24.945
No, actually.

53:25.029 --> 53:28.264
- I can give you another minute.
- You know what? Wait!

53:28.349 --> 53:30.936
I'm gonna get french onion soup,

53:31.220 --> 53:36.718
veggie burger- I'll try All five of
the Sundaes and chili cheese fries.

53:36.989 --> 53:38.575
Wait! You know what?

53:39.021 --> 53:42.099
I'm gonna get one of
everything off the menu.

53:42.640 --> 53:43.493
Well...

53:43.577 --> 53:47.143
Maybe not one of
everything of the menu...

53:47.329 --> 53:50.896
Why not? Come on! We've
never done it before. It'll be fun.

53:50.981 --> 53:52.480
Put it all in, thanks.

53:52.564 --> 53:53.685
Okay.

53:55.388 --> 53:56.486
What?

53:56.571 --> 54:00.865
Mia, we can't afford that. You can't order
one of everything of the menu.

54:00.950 --> 54:03.435
We're fine. We still
have got our savings.

54:03.940 --> 54:06.557
Plus it's... our honeymoon.

54:11.007 --> 54:12.732
Do you hear that?

54:15.767 --> 54:17.427
It's our song.

54:17.974 --> 54:19.701
No!

54:19.748 --> 54:20.865
Come on!

54:21.012 --> 54:22.386
Please!

54:22.575 --> 54:24.288
What are you so afraid of?

54:24.373 --> 54:26.335
No, we're in
public.

54:26.420 --> 54:29.236
This is a restaurant,
people are trying to eat.

54:29.321 --> 54:31.917
- They don't want to see us dance.
- So what?

54:32.002 --> 54:34.336
- We've danced before.
- You forced me.

54:34.421 --> 54:36.197
Some things never change.

54:36.981 --> 54:38.693
- Come on!
- Okey!

54:38.780 --> 54:39.709
My leg.

54:42.981 --> 54:44.817
All right, there it is.

54:52.501 --> 54:54.731
I am so sorry!

54:56.581 --> 54:58.684
I'm pretty sure, she hates us now.

54:59.861 --> 55:01.113
Oh god!

55:02.926 --> 55:06.551
I tried one dance move
and I almost ruined everything.

55:06.636 --> 55:07.768
Stop!

55:08.341 --> 55:09.640
You're fine.

55:09.724 --> 55:11.182
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:11.973 --> 55:13.716
Like better than you?

55:13.801 --> 55:14.643
No.

55:15.817 --> 55:17.016
Not there yet.

56:27.331 --> 56:28.572
Come on!

56:28.660 --> 56:29.893
No!

56:31.854 --> 56:33.947
- Ready?
- No!

56:34.104 --> 56:34.937
One...

56:35.940 --> 56:36.773
Two...

56:41.220 --> 56:43.398
I like when you hold me like this.

56:43.482 --> 56:44.417
Why?

56:44.501 --> 56:48.104
I don't know. You're like my knight in a
shining armor.

56:56.420 --> 56:58.026
- Okay, let's go!
- Yeah.

56:59.874 --> 57:01.619
Looks like we just missed it.

57:01.704 --> 57:03.533
Yeah, it will pas.

57:03.618 --> 57:05.534
What do you think this place is?

57:05.618 --> 57:08.213
I don't know. Looks like somebody's barn.

57:08.354 --> 57:10.737
No, this is not another one of those

57:10.821 --> 57:12.799
chicken slaughterhouses, is it?

57:16.251 --> 57:18.583
- You know this reminds me of?
- What?

57:18.668 --> 57:21.332
When almost burnt
down that abandoned asylum.

57:21.417 --> 57:23.536
You're the one who brought the fire.

57:23.621 --> 57:25.787
You're the one who brought the dope.

57:26.130 --> 57:27.533
You're a bad influence.

57:27.938 --> 57:30.583
There's nothing wrong
in smoking a joint.

57:34.180 --> 57:35.540
Watch yourself!

58:17.550 --> 58:20.277
Do you ever try and think
what's beyond space?

58:20.458 --> 58:23.175
And when you try and
think your mind literally

58:23.259 --> 58:25.978
short circuits because
you can't even fathom it

58:26.076 --> 58:27.088
Yep!

58:28.051 --> 58:31.161
Like we think, we know so much as a
race but...

58:32.542 --> 58:33.910
We don't know anything.

58:36.790 --> 58:39.622
What if we're like a cell
in somebody's body?

58:41.439 --> 58:43.291
Or an alien experiment.

58:43.376 --> 58:45.123
You don't believe in aliens.

58:45.208 --> 58:46.653
Maybe I am an alien.

58:46.738 --> 58:48.937
Mia, my name is Liam.

58:49.183 --> 58:51.135
I am from the planet Andromeda.

58:51.949 --> 58:54.801
Give me more beans!
I need them to live.

58:59.859 --> 59:02.604
You do not need any more beans.

59:02.689 --> 59:03.901
Nope.

59:03.985 --> 59:06.200
Or I might not have a wife anymore.

59:14.821 --> 59:16.622
I had a lot of fun today.

59:17.861 --> 59:21.450
Every day, since we've officially started
our honeymoon.

59:21.969 --> 59:23.247
Me too.

59:27.801 --> 59:32.335
Why did you let them go if you knew, they
were just gonna round them up again?

59:32.420 --> 59:34.330
What? The animals?

59:34.507 --> 59:36.082
I don't know.

59:36.360 --> 59:38.714
Because they were like in a cue to die.

59:38.937 --> 59:41.193
And I wanted them to feel free again.

59:41.381 --> 59:43.669
Even if it was just for the last time.

59:45.603 --> 59:48.715
Everyone deserves that chance to
experience freedom.

59:53.220 --> 59:56.028
This reminds me so much of "Lion King".

59:57.117 --> 59:58.346
Of course it does.

59:58.669 --> 59:59.871
Simba!

1:00:00.821 --> 1:00:03.731
Let me tell you something,
that my father told me.

1:00:06.036 --> 1:00:07.864
You're Mufasa.

1:00:08.383 --> 1:00:10.231
That's on point.

1:00:12.746 --> 1:00:14.825
Look at the stars.

1:00:16.101 --> 1:00:20.012
Great kings from the past
look down at us from the stars.

1:00:21.460 --> 1:00:24.911
So if you ever feel
alone, just remember...

1:00:25.653 --> 1:00:28.380
Those kings will always
be there to guide you.

1:00:29.859 --> 1:00:31.319
So will I.

1:00:49.348 --> 1:00:51.049
Hey!

1:00:51.133 --> 1:00:52.505
Let's go to bed.

1:00:52.715 --> 1:00:53.767
Yeah.

1:00:53.852 --> 1:00:55.743
I'll get you a hot water bottle.

1:00:55.828 --> 1:00:56.872
Okay.

1:00:57.700 --> 1:00:59.083
Come on.

1:01:03.220 --> 1:01:06.427
Liam, can you get me
a painkiller, please?

1:01:09.781 --> 1:01:10.815
What painkillers?

1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:12.506
The T4's.

1:01:12.747 --> 1:01:16.402
Those are expired. You've had
them for your wisdom teeth.

1:01:16.487 --> 1:01:18.342
Prescription meds don't expire.

1:01:18.624 --> 1:01:19.777
It's a hoax.

1:01:20.183 --> 1:01:23.604
No, they're really hard on your liver,
don't take them.

1:01:23.689 --> 1:01:25.813
Liam, please! I'm in pain.

1:02:01.162 --> 1:02:02.576
Compromise.

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:04.074
Thank you.

1:02:16.501 --> 1:02:18.367
I feel better already.

1:02:26.655 --> 1:02:29.406
I didn't want our star date to end.

1:02:29.781 --> 1:02:30.766
It's okay.

1:02:32.736 --> 1:02:35.242
This feels too hospitally right now.

1:02:35.919 --> 1:02:37.430
Just try and relax.

1:02:42.064 --> 1:02:43.500
Okay.

1:02:53.061 --> 1:02:54.271
What are you doing?

1:02:55.398 --> 1:02:57.180
Let's continue the honeymoon.

1:03:09.541 --> 1:03:10.459
Is it better?

1:03:10.992 --> 1:03:12.211
Yeah.

1:03:13.371 --> 1:03:14.938
Thank you.

1:03:56.021 --> 1:03:57.427
Are you serious?

1:03:57.797 --> 1:04:01.239
At your... service.

1:04:01.564 --> 1:04:04.975
I don't think you've ever made
me breakfast in bed before.

1:04:05.060 --> 1:04:07.246
Here, I'll refill your water bottle.

1:04:07.331 --> 1:04:09.203
No, stay.

1:04:09.859 --> 1:04:11.098
Sit with me.

1:04:11.206 --> 1:04:12.562
Share with me.

1:04:12.907 --> 1:04:14.937
It's okay, I'll eat later.

1:04:16.968 --> 1:04:18.302
Mia, hey!

1:04:18.386 --> 1:04:20.242
Are you okay? Is it bad?

1:04:20.327 --> 1:04:21.208
No.

1:04:22.851 --> 1:04:24.070
I'm just...

1:04:25.888 --> 1:04:29.304
I'm just not hungry, I've got nauseous.

1:04:30.899 --> 1:04:32.074
Hey, look...

1:04:32.358 --> 1:04:35.135
You haven't eaten a lot in the
last couple days.

1:04:35.220 --> 1:04:36.445
I'm not hungry.

1:04:38.336 --> 1:04:39.427
I'm sorry.

1:04:39.512 --> 1:04:43.136
It's that I know you made
this for me and I'm really grateful.

1:04:43.220 --> 1:04:45.297
It's not about the breakfast, Mia.

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:49.169
I'm worried, you're not getting
enough nutrients to stay healthy.

1:04:49.254 --> 1:04:50.617
Like that matters.

1:04:50.702 --> 1:04:52.320
Shut up, it does matter.

1:04:52.420 --> 1:04:54.140
Don't tell me to shut up.

1:04:55.518 --> 1:04:56.586
Look...

1:04:57.902 --> 1:04:58.789
You know...

1:04:58.874 --> 1:05:03.105
If we were in a hospital, they'd put
you on an IV, if you couldn't eat.

1:05:03.190 --> 1:05:05.210
Are we actually doing this again?

1:05:05.295 --> 1:05:07.925
- I can't sit here and watch you die.
-Stop!

1:05:08.269 --> 1:05:09.596
Maybe if we...

1:05:09.681 --> 1:05:13.098
Maybe we called you parents.
It's not too late. Maybe they

1:05:13.182 --> 1:05:16.598
can get you on a vitamin IV
or some biological treatments.

1:05:16.683 --> 1:05:18.324
It is too late.

1:05:19.658 --> 1:05:22.488
It is too late for this conversation.

1:05:25.375 --> 1:05:28.283
You promised me you would not pick up
that phone.

1:05:28.367 --> 1:05:29.937
And call my parents.

1:05:30.767 --> 1:05:31.989
I don't need them.

1:05:32.206 --> 1:05:33.992
I don't need the hospital.

1:05:35.459 --> 1:05:36.724
I need you.

1:05:37.078 --> 1:05:38.831
I need you to support me.

1:05:39.541 --> 1:05:41.523
No matter how bad things get.

1:05:44.581 --> 1:05:45.877
Just promise me that.

1:05:50.732 --> 1:05:51.931
Okay.

1:05:54.741 --> 1:05:55.889
I promise.

1:05:55.996 --> 1:05:57.227
Good.

1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:32.649
I'm just gonna be a sec, okay?

1:07:49.770 --> 1:07:52.533
We're only about 20
minutes from lake Tarragon.

1:07:52.618 --> 1:07:55.007
Why don't you go inside and take a nap?

1:07:57.364 --> 1:07:59.122
Hey, I love you!

1:08:02.101 --> 1:08:03.640
I love you, too!

1:09:39.701 --> 1:09:42.240
It looks like summer is officially over.

1:09:49.781 --> 1:09:52.460
I guess it only makes sense that we
steal it.

1:09:54.661 --> 1:09:56.101
Hey, Mia!

1:09:58.025 --> 1:09:59.070
You okay?

1:09:59.901 --> 1:10:01.078
Yeah.

1:10:03.141 --> 1:10:07.289
Why don't you relax, meditate or
something and I'll...

1:10:07.941 --> 1:10:08.953
I'll make dinner.

1:10:09.695 --> 1:10:10.841
Okay.

1:13:29.778 --> 1:13:31.175
Mia!

1:13:47.416 --> 1:13:50.548
Mia!

1:13:52.744 --> 1:13:54.056
Oh God!

1:14:03.675 --> 1:14:05.075
Come on!

1:14:15.712 --> 1:14:17.712
I thought I lost you.

1:14:21.196 --> 1:14:22.625
Come on!

1:14:22.673 --> 1:14:24.594
I'm gonna put you down, OK?

1:14:26.421 --> 1:14:28.290
Here we go. Wait.

1:14:29.345 --> 1:14:32.125
Let's get this off.

1:14:37.024 --> 1:14:38.710
What happened out there?

1:14:40.079 --> 1:14:42.610
I fell asleep,
and tried to swim back.

1:14:44.446 --> 1:14:46.741
Okay, we've gotta get you warm.

1:15:01.415 --> 1:15:02.487
Come here!

1:15:02.571 --> 1:15:04.571
You're okey?

1:15:07.876 --> 1:15:09.474
Look at me.

1:15:09.559 --> 1:15:11.093
Are you okay?

1:16:07.701 --> 1:16:08.941
Oh my God.

1:16:49.868 --> 1:16:51.584
How are you feeling?

1:16:51.953 --> 1:16:53.429
I'm fine.

1:16:55.221 --> 1:16:57.188
How long have I been out for?

1:16:58.711 --> 1:17:00.047
A while.

1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:07.941
I've got the job.

1:17:09.104 --> 1:17:10.197
What?

1:17:11.636 --> 1:17:14.550
I have my dream job at the Nomad Times.

1:17:15.258 --> 1:17:18.355
I just got an email. I didn't think I had
a chance.

1:17:19.923 --> 1:17:24.206
I'm gonna be the best travel
columnist, the country has ever seen.

1:17:24.291 --> 1:17:26.371
When we finish
our trip in Portland,

1:17:26.456 --> 1:17:29.091
I'm gonna have enough
to write for months.

1:17:29.176 --> 1:17:30.102
Mia?

1:17:30.311 --> 1:17:31.657
What?

1:17:31.866 --> 1:17:33.660
What is your problem, Liam?

1:17:34.157 --> 1:17:36.493
Why can't you ever be happy for me?

1:17:45.576 --> 1:17:46.967
We're broke down.

1:17:48.394 --> 1:17:51.616
I put Diesel in. I
should have been putting in regular.

1:17:51.701 --> 1:17:53.253
Bad habit, I guess.

1:17:53.712 --> 1:17:55.597
Okay, when is the tow coming?

1:17:56.528 --> 1:17:58.574
When are we gonna get to Portland?

1:17:59.114 --> 1:18:01.620
I don't think we're gonna get to Portland.

1:18:02.362 --> 1:18:05.135
We've come this far, we're gonna get
there.

1:18:05.220 --> 1:18:07.581
We don't have enough money to fix it.

1:18:08.181 --> 1:18:09.235
Yes, we do.

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:10.817
No, we don't.

1:18:10.902 --> 1:18:13.737
It's gonna cost thousands and we're
running out.

1:18:13.822 --> 1:18:15.667
Okay, well how much do we have?

1:18:16.449 --> 1:18:17.730
400 bucks.

1:18:18.667 --> 1:18:22.074
No, that's not how much we have.

1:18:22.299 --> 1:18:26.017
We have our savings and we have
a couple of thousand in there.

1:18:26.109 --> 1:18:28.300
We need an ATM, give me your phone!

1:18:29.448 --> 1:18:31.441
We don't have any savings left.

1:18:33.104 --> 1:18:35.058
What are you talking about?

1:18:37.849 --> 1:18:39.081
I used it.

1:18:40.549 --> 1:18:44.658
I made a bad investment, when we were
starting the business and...

1:18:44.751 --> 1:18:46.500
I wanted to tell you but...

1:18:46.785 --> 1:18:48.066
The timing and...

1:18:49.159 --> 1:18:50.988
Mia, I'm sorry.

1:18:51.460 --> 1:18:54.001
Are you kidding me?

1:18:54.519 --> 1:18:55.566
No.

1:18:55.781 --> 1:18:56.828
I'm not.

1:18:57.015 --> 1:18:59.113
How could you do that, Liam?

1:18:59.198 --> 1:19:00.641
What are we gonna do?

1:19:00.726 --> 1:19:02.502
We're running out of options.

1:19:02.586 --> 1:19:03.532
No, we're not!

1:19:03.617 --> 1:19:06.976
I'm gonna find someone, who's
gonna do it for our money.

1:19:07.061 --> 1:19:08.935
Mia, you've got to stop this!

1:19:09.143 --> 1:19:10.432
Okay?

1:19:10.517 --> 1:19:13.806
We've got to stop this whole
thing. What are you doing?

1:19:13.890 --> 1:19:16.897
You're taking Tylenol
threes and sleeping pills.

1:19:16.981 --> 1:19:19.097
Do you know how out of it you were?

1:19:19.182 --> 1:19:20.753
You were so out of it!

1:19:20.912 --> 1:19:24.792
You passed out in a canoe, in a frozen
lake and almost drowned.

1:19:27.191 --> 1:19:28.212
I mean...

1:19:28.310 --> 1:19:31.363
You've been throwing up blood.
When did that start?

1:19:32.762 --> 1:19:34.566
What do you want me to say?

1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:37.855
Try being in my band,
and see what you would do.

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:41.738
I know, what I would do. I
told you, what I would do.

1:19:47.706 --> 1:19:49.410
I want to support you.

1:19:51.025 --> 1:19:52.262
I want to help you.

1:19:52.346 --> 1:19:53.894
But you won't let me.

1:19:56.775 --> 1:19:59.488
I don't need your help!

1:20:00.340 --> 1:20:02.214
Yeah, you do.

1:20:03.471 --> 1:20:04.548
You're sick, Mia.

1:20:04.636 --> 1:20:05.840
You're manic

1:20:05.925 --> 1:20:08.796
And you know what? I'm
not gonna stand around and

1:20:08.881 --> 1:20:11.790
be a bystander anymore.
This is hurting too much.

1:20:14.408 --> 1:20:16.324
I'm calling the tow.

1:20:50.675 --> 1:20:52.963
You talk to her about the divorce yet?

1:21:07.201 --> 1:21:10.381
You better be back in the
office by Monday,Griffon!

1:21:22.865 --> 1:21:24.818
Anything you want to tell me?

1:21:25.770 --> 1:21:26.681
No?

1:21:26.766 --> 1:21:28.263
Than what is this shit?

1:21:30.897 --> 1:21:32.034
Mia, wait!

1:21:32.118 --> 1:21:34.201
No, I waited...

1:21:34.698 --> 1:21:35.865
And I tried.

1:21:36.493 --> 1:21:39.919
Is this what you wanted to
tell me at the doctor's office?

1:21:43.119 --> 1:21:45.630
You're not here because you love me.

1:21:46.012 --> 1:21:48.961
You're here because you
couldn't sleeping with the

1:21:49.045 --> 1:21:52.361
reality of leaving me to
die alone of cancer. Admit it!

1:21:52.446 --> 1:21:53.425
Admit it!

1:21:53.509 --> 1:21:54.451
It's not true.

1:21:56.740 --> 1:21:58.800
I don't even know you anymore.

1:21:59.185 --> 1:22:01.787
You act
like you have the secret life.

1:22:01.872 --> 1:22:05.705
You spend our savings, you lied
about quitting, and the feelings.

1:22:05.790 --> 1:22:07.667
You don't get it!

1:22:07.751 --> 1:22:08.888
I get it!

1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:11.349
You're selfish.

1:22:12.521 --> 1:22:13.956
I'm selfish?

1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:15.802
Yeah, you!

1:22:16.537 --> 1:22:17.761
What about you, Mia?

1:22:17.846 --> 1:22:18.758
Me?

1:22:18.842 --> 1:22:19.849
Yeah, you.

1:22:20.945 --> 1:22:23.412
We spent every last dime on this trip.

1:22:24.181 --> 1:22:26.998
And you die... and then what?

1:22:27.404 --> 1:22:28.404
Mia!

1:22:29.387 --> 1:22:34.107
My life... it goes on. With or
without you. That that's the reality.

1:22:34.208 --> 1:22:39.251
Have you given any thought to that or is
your life the only one that matters here?

1:22:39.375 --> 1:22:41.630
Yeah, I have thought about it.

1:22:42.248 --> 1:22:44.245
I'm hard-pressed to believe that.

1:22:44.330 --> 1:22:47.833
Because you don't seem to
think about anybody, but yourself.

1:22:48.074 --> 1:22:50.226
You want to know what
happened to us?

1:22:50.311 --> 1:22:53.136
Why don't you watch,
where you point the finger.

1:22:53.221 --> 1:22:55.941
You know, Mia? When stuff like this
happens...

1:22:56.013 --> 1:22:59.935
at work, or in life.
You don't just give up!

1:23:01.801 --> 1:23:06.475
Says my husband, who wanted a
divorce without even giving it a chance.

1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:08.475
How was I supposed to tell you

1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:11.310
that we had no money,
when you were gonna die?

1:23:11.511 --> 1:23:12.753
That I...

1:23:12.837 --> 1:23:14.626
have to go back to work

1:23:14.734 --> 1:23:16.834
to make money to live.

1:23:17.216 --> 1:23:18.856
That's the reality, Mia!

1:23:19.442 --> 1:23:21.095
That's the truth.

1:23:21.289 --> 1:23:22.611
And you don't see it.

1:23:22.863 --> 1:23:24.495
And you're running from it.

1:23:24.580 --> 1:23:26.180
And you know what I think?

1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:30.322
I think you wish you went to that
hospital, that time is running out.

1:23:30.407 --> 1:23:34.678
There might not be a tomorrow and
there might not be some dream job, Mia!

1:23:34.762 --> 1:23:36.119
Don't put this on me.

1:23:36.670 --> 1:23:40.034
This isn't about me. This is about
you lying to me.

1:23:40.119 --> 1:23:43.109
The last 30 days meant everything to me!

1:23:44.466 --> 1:23:45.740
Liar!

1:23:48.865 --> 1:23:50.904
I feel like an idiot.

1:23:54.134 --> 1:23:57.443
I'm sorry... for not thinking of you.

1:23:59.591 --> 1:24:01.005
This isn't fair.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:06.771
But Iâ€™m not gonna sit
here and take another lie.

1:24:13.370 --> 1:24:15.974
That doesn't look like a tow truck.

1:24:22.824 --> 1:24:24.346
You promised!

1:24:24.431 --> 1:24:27.355
Mia, you need to know, this is
because I love you.

1:24:27.493 --> 1:24:29.497
You don't love me!

1:24:30.001 --> 1:24:32.810
I hate you!

1:24:35.795 --> 1:24:37.033
Relax, man!

1:24:37.118 --> 1:24:38.748
Roger, get this guy off me!

1:24:38.833 --> 1:24:40.229
We're taking her home.

1:24:40.342 --> 1:24:44.162
To resume the treatment that she
should have started a month ago.

1:24:44.247 --> 1:24:47.374
You can't take her home. That's like
three hours away.

1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:48.767
I'm going with you.

1:24:48.852 --> 1:24:51.398
You're not going
anywhere near our daughter.

1:24:51.461 --> 1:24:52.880
She needs to be with me.

1:24:53.024 --> 1:24:54.920
Near our home, near our life.

1:24:55.271 --> 1:24:56.237
Oh, yes!

1:24:56.380 --> 1:24:59.558
Because being with you
is working so well for her!

1:24:59.704 --> 1:25:01.084
She's nearly dead.

1:25:01.169 --> 1:25:04.661
I told you where we were,
to get her to a local hospital.

1:25:04.746 --> 1:25:09.613
I am not negotiating with the same idiot,
who brainwashed and abducted my daughter.

1:25:09.698 --> 1:25:11.436
Stay the hell away from her!

1:25:11.521 --> 1:25:12.653
I didn't take her!

1:25:13.145 --> 1:25:14.316
Look at her!

1:25:14.841 --> 1:25:17.011
She doesn't want to see you.

1:25:17.212 --> 1:25:18.229
That's not true.

1:25:18.314 --> 1:25:20.656
She doesn't want to go
with you.

1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:22.188
Ask her, Roger!

1:25:23.123 --> 1:25:24.591
That is not true.

1:25:26.341 --> 1:25:28.635
Roger, she's fading. Oh God!

1:25:28.775 --> 1:25:29.959
Mia!

1:25:32.661 --> 1:25:34.441
That's my wife!

1:28:37.472 --> 1:28:40.287
It smells like failure
around here, lately.

1:28:40.661 --> 1:28:43.330
Hey, Liam! Thanks for
that Sawdust account.

1:28:43.414 --> 1:28:44.683
I got a bonus.

1:28:45.262 --> 1:28:46.744
You got a raise?

1:28:46.828 --> 1:28:47.894
Yup!

1:28:49.839 --> 1:28:51.839
Griffin! Get in here!

1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:00.366
You didn't answer my text.

1:29:01.339 --> 1:29:02.887
What the hell is this?

1:29:05.816 --> 1:29:08.965
My nine-year-old, literally,
has more talent than you!

1:29:09.221 --> 1:29:12.737
Don't even get me started
on this two week fuck off. Idiot!

1:29:13.060 --> 1:29:14.747
Don't talk to me like that!

1:29:14.832 --> 1:29:15.795
What?

1:29:15.934 --> 1:29:17.857
I needed a mental health day

1:29:17.941 --> 1:29:21.105
or a mental health month and if you asked
me...

1:29:21.190 --> 1:29:22.831
Nobody's asking.

1:29:22.915 --> 1:29:24.652
Well, I'm telling you.

1:29:24.848 --> 1:29:29.004
Because no one else around here,
has the balls to tell you, like it is.

1:29:29.474 --> 1:29:32.238
This place is a mental health hazard.

1:29:33.488 --> 1:29:36.613
I'm the best thing that ever
happened to this company.

1:29:36.785 --> 1:29:39.103
I helped build this place.

1:29:39.316 --> 1:29:42.977
You know Satellite City was
going to sign with PG&R before.

1:29:43.061 --> 1:29:45.353
I convinced them to sign with us.

1:29:45.980 --> 1:29:48.089
They're our biggest client now.

1:29:48.174 --> 1:29:52.232
I worked my ass off for you for five
years. And how do you repay me?

1:29:52.317 --> 1:29:55.248
You demote me and you
replace me with your nephew.

1:29:55.333 --> 1:29:59.757
Who's got zero qualifications
in the field. He only knows what

1:29:59.864 --> 1:30:04.727
color turtleneck to wear in what
season and being a complete dick.

1:30:05.378 --> 1:30:08.541
I don't need you.
I can run company on my own.

1:30:08.626 --> 1:30:12.673
And I think that's why you treat
me like shit. Because you know it.

1:30:13.135 --> 1:30:14.059
Get out!

1:30:16.501 --> 1:30:18.887
You misunderstood. I quit!

1:30:23.957 --> 1:30:25.317
Jerry!

1:30:27.503 --> 1:30:28.723
Go fuck yourself!

1:31:29.327 --> 1:31:31.238
I know you're mad at me.

1:31:33.415 --> 1:31:35.321
I want to take you somewhere.

1:31:36.523 --> 1:31:38.005
Just for one day.

1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:43.330
But my dad is here.

1:31:43.414 --> 1:31:45.239
I'm not afraid of your dad.

1:31:49.300 --> 1:31:50.641
You wanna go?

1:32:22.820 --> 1:32:24.622
I thought you'd like this.

1:32:26.433 --> 1:32:29.215
I won't bring you back,
if you don't want me to.

1:32:35.427 --> 1:32:37.223
I meant everything, Mia.

1:32:44.344 --> 1:32:46.942
I'm such an idiot for
not fighting for you.

1:32:48.687 --> 1:32:50.504
I don't even fight for myself.

1:32:55.119 --> 1:32:57.927
and this amazing, strong woman...

1:32:58.425 --> 1:33:00.778
and I forgot who I was even married to.

1:33:04.559 --> 1:33:05.966
You want the truth?

1:33:11.279 --> 1:33:15.800
I was falling in love with you all over
again and that was breaking my heart.

1:33:17.613 --> 1:33:20.354
And I didn't want to
lose you all over again.

1:33:20.649 --> 1:33:22.668
Now I want to go through it.

1:33:25.009 --> 1:33:26.407
I meant everything.

1:33:27.044 --> 1:33:28.817
Every candle and meal...

1:33:28.901 --> 1:33:30.551
Every animal adventure...

1:33:30.768 --> 1:33:34.575
And I'm so angry it took me
this long to get to know you again

1:33:35.061 --> 1:33:37.559
and find more ways to love you every day.

1:33:38.291 --> 1:33:41.167
Well, I could have been
doing it the whole time.

1:33:45.941 --> 1:33:47.117
I get it.

1:33:49.300 --> 1:33:50.789
We all want to be free.

1:33:52.953 --> 1:33:54.602
We all want to be loved.

1:33:56.993 --> 1:33:58.827
It's not that hard to get.

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.297
It's too late.

1:34:08.126 --> 1:34:09.656
Now, the honeymoon's over.

1:34:17.466 --> 1:34:19.527
Honeymoon never ended.

1:34:47.232 --> 1:34:49.511
I'm not gonna give up on you, Mia.

1:34:52.784 --> 1:34:54.125
I love you.

1:34:55.012 --> 1:34:56.535
I love you too, Liam.

1:35:23.157 --> 1:35:24.017
Hey...

1:35:25.893 --> 1:35:27.746
You want to stay here?

1:35:28.890 --> 1:35:30.610
You want me to take you back?

1:35:34.423 --> 1:35:35.712
Mia?

1:35:42.744 --> 1:35:44.220
Mia!

1:36:25.220 --> 1:36:27.142
The risk of love is loss.

1:36:27.675 --> 1:36:30.423
And the price of loss is grief.

1:36:31.266 --> 1:36:33.834
But the pain in grief is only a shadow.

1:36:33.996 --> 1:36:37.209
When compared to the pain of never
risking love at all.

1:36:38.268 --> 1:36:40.306
Love is a journey.

1:36:41.783 --> 1:36:43.131
It's like a road trip.

1:36:44.321 --> 1:36:48.235
Every twist, turn and miraculous
detour, has its purpose.

1:36:50.724 --> 1:36:53.290
You don't know what roadblocks are ahead.

1:36:53.430 --> 1:36:56.525
And sometimes you don't know if you'll
even make it.

1:36:57.810 --> 1:36:59.475
When the dark falls...

1:37:00.017 --> 1:37:01.807
And the rain pours
you...

1:37:02.032 --> 1:37:03.780
you can't see the road ahead.

1:37:04.342 --> 1:37:06.258
You just have to keep driving.

1:37:07.530 --> 1:37:09.595
Trust that the sun will rise again.

1:37:09.912 --> 1:37:11.634
And the rain will stop.

1:37:13.352 --> 1:37:17.461
Maybe the Universe puts these
roadblocks in front of us for a reason.

1:37:17.546 --> 1:37:18.579
So...

1:37:19.016 --> 1:37:21.589
So we come out
stronger on the other side.

1:37:22.024 --> 1:37:25.048
There's something, my
beautiful wife taught me.

1:37:25.770 --> 1:37:29.286
It's easy to say we'll do it tomorrow,
and never do it.

1:37:29.621 --> 1:37:32.857
It's easy to say "I love
you" and not mean it.

1:37:33.970 --> 1:37:35.359
Talk is cheap.

1:37:36.212 --> 1:37:39.118
Find ways to love each other every day.

1:37:40.301 --> 1:37:42.856
If you've had a hard day at work...

1:37:43.181 --> 1:37:45.233
And you're tired to find time...

1:37:45.988 --> 1:37:49.251
Cause we'll never truly
know, how much of it we have.

1:37:50.820 --> 1:37:52.501
Never give up on each other.

1:37:52.585 --> 1:37:54.642
And never let the honeymoon end.

1:37:54.727 --> 1:37:57.829
That's best advice I can
give to a newlywed couple.

1:37:59.300 --> 1:38:01.690
For the bride and groom! Cheers!
