WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:08.642
( ringing )

00:17.918 --> 00:19.887
HELLO?

00:19.987 --> 00:22.423
OH, HI, PATRICK.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.629
CAN YOU SLOW--
SLOW DOWN FOR A MINUTE?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.534
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE F--

00:33.634 --> 00:35.469
HE FELL?

00:35.569 --> 00:38.639
B-B-BUT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
DAD WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:40.341 --> 00:43.511
( sighs )
OKAY OKAY, FINE FINE.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.980
I'LL-- I'LL PAY
MORE ATTENTION TO HIM.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.649
WAIT!

00:48.749 --> 00:50.818
WHEN DID
THEY TRANSFER HIM?

00:52.653 --> 00:55.756
BUT HOW LONG
AFTER HE HAD THE FEVER?

00:57.358 --> 01:00.361
IT'S A FUCKING NURSING HOME.
THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT!

01:01.462 --> 01:03.331
OKAY OK--

01:04.598 --> 01:08.102
OKAY, I'M NOT YELLING
AT YOU. I'M SORRY.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.140
OKAY, I'LL BE THERE
ON SATURDAY.

01:21.249 --> 01:24.685
( theme music playing )

01:57.117 --> 01:59.420
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
ABOUT ONE THING:

01:59.520 --> 02:02.756
THEY TOOK AWAY MY PHONE
AND MY BLACKBERRY.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.360
I HATED THOSE THINGS.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.363
IN MY DAY AN EXEC
NEVER TYPED A NOTE.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.933
NEVER TOOK ONE.
NEVER CARRIED ANYTHING.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.570
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
A DINOSAUR.

02:19.039 --> 02:22.142
- I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
- ( chuckles )

02:22.243 --> 02:24.512
I HOPE YOU DON'T FEEL
ANY PRESSURE TODAY.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.547
I MEAN, I FINALLY HAVE
THE TIME TO TALK TO YOU,

02:26.647 --> 02:28.816
BUT IT'S TOO LATE
FOR YOU TO HELP.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.554
HOW ARE
YOU HANDLING IT?

02:33.654 --> 02:37.558
( dryly )
OH, I'M WONDERFUL, PAUL.
ACES.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.229
I KNOW YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE
PAST THE POINT WHERE--

02:41.329 --> 02:44.064
WHERE TALKING
COULD BE OF HELP.

02:44.164 --> 02:48.101
BUT LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,
WHY DON'T WE--

02:48.202 --> 02:50.338
WHY DON'T WE TRY?

02:52.273 --> 02:54.508
WELL, WHAT IS THERE
TO SAY?

02:54.608 --> 02:59.012
I'VE LOST MY JOB, MY NAME.
I CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.

02:59.112 --> 03:03.317
THERE'S A PACK OF REPORTERS
ON THE STREET WAITING
FOR ME TO COME OUT

03:03.417 --> 03:06.520
SO THEY CAN STICK MICROPHONES
AND CAMERAS IN MY FACE.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.989
SO COMING HERE TODAY MEANT
YOU HAD TO RUN A--

03:09.089 --> 03:11.725
- RUN A GAUNTLET.
- OH, I CAN HANDLE THAT.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.361
I TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.429
I DID EVERYTHING
I WAS SUPPOSED TO,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.831
THAT I TOOK
THE PAGES STRAIGHT
FROM THE PLAYBOOK.

03:17.931 --> 03:21.602
- WHAT PLAYBOOK IS THAT?
- JOHNSON & JOHNSON,

03:21.702 --> 03:23.437
THE TYLENOL SCANDAL:

03:23.537 --> 03:25.606
SEVEN DEAD
FROM PRODUCT TAMPERING

03:25.706 --> 03:27.675
AND THE COMPANY HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,

03:27.775 --> 03:30.278
BUT THEY PULLED
EVERY BOTTLE NATIONWIDE.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.980
IT'S STILL THE GOLD STANDARD
FOR CRISIS MANAGEMENT.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.584
AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,
YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN

03:36.684 --> 03:39.720
TO INFORM
AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC
AND PROTECT YOUR NAME

03:39.820 --> 03:41.622
LONG TERM.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.592
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
WENT WRONG?

03:44.692 --> 03:48.462
HERE, CONNIE LET ME READ
THIS ONE ARTICLE...

03:49.297 --> 03:51.699
IN THE "JOURNAL."

03:53.233 --> 03:55.936
UH...

03:56.036 --> 03:58.672
THEY CAME FLAT OUT AND SAID
I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.674
"PLAYED BY THE RULES."

04:00.774 --> 04:04.912
THE ONLY THING IS THE WORLD'S
CHANGED A LOT SINCE 1982.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.482
IT'S MORE PREDATORY.
THE MINUTE WE ASSUMED
RESPONSIBILITY

04:08.582 --> 04:10.618
THE BLOGGERS,
THE PRESS,

04:10.718 --> 04:13.587
THE CLASS-ACTION LAWYERS
CAME AFTER US.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.624
THEN THE SHORT-SELLERS
HAMMERED THE STOCK DOWN

04:16.724 --> 04:20.794
AND THAT'S WHEN THE PARASITES
IN MY OWN COMPANY

04:20.894 --> 04:24.097
SAW THIS AS SOME FUCKING
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEMSELVES.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.368
AND THEN THE DONALDSONS
CAPITULATED.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.871
"A PERFECT STORM"
THEY CALLED IT.

04:30.971 --> 04:34.708
SO WHEN YOU'RE READING
AN ARTICLE LIKE THIS,
HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL?

04:36.310 --> 04:38.746
( sighs )

04:38.846 --> 04:40.314
LIKE AN OLD MAN

04:40.414 --> 04:43.283
WHO STAYED TOO LONG
IN THE RING.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.987
YOU FEEL LIKE A--
LIKE A BOXER

04:47.087 --> 04:49.690
WHO'S TAKEN A BEATING.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.994
I DROPPED
MY GUARD, PAUL.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.565
I DESERVE EVERYTHING
I'VE GOTTEN.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.408
- ARE YOU EATING?
- YEAH, I EAT WHEN I HAVE TO.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.378
SHREDDED WHEAT,
CHICKEN SOUP--

05:10.478 --> 05:12.446
THAT'S WHAT
I HAD TODAY, OKAY?

05:12.546 --> 05:14.181
HOW ABOUT SLEEP,
ARE YOU GETTING ANY?

05:14.281 --> 05:16.617
ARE YOU A THERAPIST
OR A PEDIATRICIAN?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.621
YEAH, I SLEEP.
THE PILLS HELP.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.491
HAS YOUR DOCTOR WRITTEN ANY
OTHER PRESCRIPTIONS FOR YOU?

05:23.591 --> 05:26.460
WELL, UNDER
NATALIE'S NAME, YEAH.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.530
ANY DAY NOW THERE'LL BE
A HEADLINE IN "THE POST":

05:29.630 --> 05:32.666
"BABY-KILLER C.E.O.
BINGES OUT ON PILLS."

05:32.766 --> 05:36.136
BABY KILLER?
IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL
THAT YOU'RE BEING DEPICTED?

05:36.236 --> 05:39.039
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ACTUALLY.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.943
MY WIFE ISN'T EVEN LETTING ME
WATCH TV EXCEPT FOR OLD MOVIES.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.047
I'M IN A BUNKER
WITH A REMOTE CONTROL

05:47.147 --> 05:49.817
AND PILLS
BY MY BEDSIDE.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.087
WHAT PILLS
DO YOU TAKE?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.223
UH... IT'S CALLED...

05:56.323 --> 05:58.592
KLONI-- KLOPI--
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.260
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT HELPS ME SLEEP.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.730
AND HOW MANY
ARE YOU TAKING?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.364
WELL, IT DEPENDS.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.867
- MAYBE THREE OR FOUR.
- A DAY?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.470
IS THAT THE DOSAGE THAT
DR. WELLS HAS PRESCRIBED?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.672
THAT'S WHAT I NEED
TO SLEEP.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.174
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW
HOW MANY YOU'RE TAKING, WALTER.

06:14.274 --> 06:17.978
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD A LOT
OF EXPOSURE TO PILLS,

06:18.078 --> 06:21.281
SO YOU MAY NOT
HAVE THE TOLERANCE
THAT OTHER PEOPLE DO.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.284
WELL, WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN, PAUL?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.319
I FALL ASLEEP
AND I DON'T WAKE UP?

06:26.420 --> 06:29.256
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

06:29.356 --> 06:31.459
TAKE A PILL,
FALL ASLEEP,
NOT WAKE UP?

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
NO NO,
I WANT TO WAKE UP.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.597
I WANT TO FIND THAT
THE LAST TWO MONTHS
WERE JUST A NIGHTMARE,

06:36.697 --> 06:39.266
THAT THE PIPELINE
DIDN'T GET CONTAMINATED,

06:39.366 --> 06:40.968
THAT THE PRESS DIDN'T
VILIFY ME,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.937
THAT THE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH ME
DIDN'T LIE TO ME.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.540
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.709
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU MIGHT FEEL THAT WAY,

06:48.809 --> 06:51.945
BUT SINCE YOU KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT THE CASE,

06:52.045 --> 06:55.449
HAVE YOU FOUND YOURSELF

06:55.549 --> 06:58.952
THINKING
THAT NOT WAKING UP

06:59.052 --> 07:00.688
MIGHT BE A SOLUTION?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.123
WHAT DO--

07:03.223 --> 07:05.759
OH, COME ON, PAUL!

07:05.859 --> 07:07.294
NO, I--

07:07.394 --> 07:10.297
I DON'T QUIT.
YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT.

07:10.397 --> 07:14.001
AND I WOULD NEVER
LEAVE A MESS LIKE THAT
FOR MY WIFE TO CLEAN UP.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.771
AS IT IS, SHE CAN'T
EVEN LOOK AT ME WITHOUT
BURSTING INTO TEARS.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.440
THAT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT
NEITHER OF YOU ARE USED TO.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.810
WELL, THE TEARS,
I'VE SEEN PLENTY OF THOSE.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.579
USUALLY RIGHT
BEFORE I CAVE IN

07:25.679 --> 07:29.116
AND GIVE HER THE SECOND BABY
OR THE THIRD BABY

07:29.216 --> 07:31.251
OR WHATEVER ELSE
SHE'S EVER WANTED.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.654
BUT WHAT IS NEW IS
THIS LOOK OF PITY.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.689
I-- IT'S JUST GOD-AWFUL.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.159
I TOLD HER NEVER TO LOOK
AT ME LIKE THAT AGAIN.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.662
YOU SURE IT'S PITY?

07:43.430 --> 07:47.367
I MEAN, SHE'S YOUR WIFE.
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 44 YEARS.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.336
SHE LOVES YOU.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.004
WHEN SHE SPOKE TO ME
ON THE PHONE--

07:51.104 --> 07:53.707
THAT'S ANOTHER THING!
I TOLD HER NEVER
TO DO THAT AGAIN.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.810
SHE FELT THAT THESE WERE
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.946
WHAT? I GOT FIRED.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

07:59.046 --> 08:01.649
THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S
GETTING FRIED-- FIRED--

08:01.749 --> 08:03.216
FIRED!

08:04.918 --> 08:09.022
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN
I GET AN ORCHESTRATED
SHOW OF COMPASSION,

08:09.122 --> 08:12.793
TEAMS OF PEOPLE DROPPING IN.
IT'S LIKE AN EPISODE OF
"THIS IS YOUR LIFE."

08:12.893 --> 08:14.795
SO IT HASN'T BEEN
A COMFORT FOR YOU TO KNOW

08:14.895 --> 08:16.730
HOW MUCH YOU'VE
TOUCHED THESE PEOPLE?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.899
IT'S BEEN EMBARRASSING.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.169
I TOLD HER YESTERDAY,
"THAT'S IT. I DON'T WANT
TO SEE ANYONE ELSE.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.773
TELL THEM I'M SICK."
I HAD TO PROMISE HER
I'D COME AND SEE YOU

08:25.873 --> 08:27.808
BEFORE SHE'D
GO ALONG WITH ME.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.111
SO BASICALLY YOU USED ME
AS A BARGAINING CHIP.
I DON'T MIND.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.014
LONG AS IT GOT YOU HERE.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.687
AND NOW WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
TELL ME, PAUL?

08:41.021 --> 08:44.692
THAT LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL?
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED?

08:44.792 --> 08:47.294
THAT IT COULD ALL
BE A BLESSING?

08:47.394 --> 08:50.497
I DON'T THINK
NOTHING HAPPENED.

08:50.598 --> 08:53.433
ON THE CONTRARY, I IMAGINE
IT MIGHT FEEL LIKE

08:53.533 --> 08:57.370
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
SOME KIND OF CRUCIBLE.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.239
PEOPLE GIVE ME
ALL THESE NOSTRUMS,

08:59.339 --> 09:00.941
THIS SELF-HELP GARBAGE.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.844
NOT WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR
RIGHT NOW, I'M SURE.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.515
AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE,

09:08.616 --> 09:11.318
DEAN LaRUE,
CAME BY THE APARTMENT

09:11.418 --> 09:13.053
ALL THE WAY FROM ROCHESTER.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.288
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CONNIE TOLD
HIM TO GET HIM THERE.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.425
BUT HE'S MY AGE.

09:18.525 --> 09:22.495
WE WERE
R.O.T.C. BUDDIES.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.398
TWO YEARS AGO
THEY FIRED HIM

09:25.498 --> 09:28.001
FROM A COMPANY
THAT HE HAD BUILT

09:28.101 --> 09:29.670
FROM THE GROUND UP.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.139
SO HE'S SOMEBODY UP HERE

09:32.239 --> 09:34.507
WHO'S GONE THROUGH

09:34.608 --> 09:37.010
- WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
- NAW.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.279
HE TELLS ME
HE'S FOUND A HOBBY.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.714
HE'S STARTED
TAKING PICTURES--

09:40.814 --> 09:45.118
LANDSCAPES,
OLD FACTORIES
AND FISHING BOATS.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.254
THEN HE PRINTS THEM UP
AND MAKES THEM

09:47.354 --> 09:49.356
INTO BOOKS
AND GIVES THEM
TO HIS FRIENDS.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.558
HE GAVE ME ONE--

09:51.659 --> 09:54.928
A PHOTOGRAPHIC ESSAY
OF CENTRALIA, PENNSYLVANIA.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.898
IS THAT THE COAL TOWN
WITH THE UNDERGROUND FIRE?

09:59.566 --> 10:02.169
I'M SURE YOU WONDERED
WHY HE GAVE YOU THAT.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.538
NO-- WELL,
WHAT DO I CARE?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.841
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.845
THE POINT IS,
DOES HE REALIZE
HOW STUPID HE LOOKS?

10:11.945 --> 10:15.315
- SO YOU DON'T BUY IT?
- IF THERE'S ONE THING
I CAN'T STAND

10:15.415 --> 10:17.584
IT'S PEOPLE
WHO FOOL THEMSELVES,

10:17.685 --> 10:21.755
LEAD FAKE LIVES,
BECOME FAKE HUMAN BEINGS.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.457
NOT ALWAYS
A CHOICE, WALTER,

10:24.557 --> 10:27.728
SO MUCH AS THE WAY
THE TWIG WAS BENT.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.764
I WANT TO SHAKE DEAN
AND SAY, "DON'T YOU KNOW

10:30.864 --> 10:34.534
EVERYBODY IS LAUGHING
AT YOU, YOU OLD FOOL?"

10:34.634 --> 10:36.837
I THREW THE BOOK OUT
AS SOON AS HE LEFT.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.707
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL AM
I GONNA DO WITH A PICTURE

10:39.807 --> 10:42.475
OF SOME SMOLDERING MEADOW
WHERE A TOWN USED TO BE?

10:42.575 --> 10:44.644
WHAT IF HE WAS REALLY
PROUD OF THE BOOK?

10:44.745 --> 10:47.447
DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT HAVE
GIVEN HIM A DIFFERENT SENSE

10:47.547 --> 10:49.516
OF ACCOMPLISHMENT,
OF ACHIEVEMENT?

10:49.616 --> 10:51.919
OR BROUGHT OUT A SIDE
OF HIM THAT MAYBE HE--

10:52.019 --> 10:55.655
NO, PAUL.
YOU'RE A SMART MAN.
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.391
IF THAT COMPANY CALLED HIM
BACK RIGHT NOW AND SAID,

10:58.491 --> 11:00.560
"HEY, WE MADE
A MISTAKE, DEAN.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.464
WE'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU BACK,"
HE'D GO RUNNING
IN A HEARTBEAT.

11:04.564 --> 11:09.436
NO, THE TRUTH IS
THAT HE'S OUTLIVED
HIS USEFULNESS.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.438
I'VE GOT A COUPLE
OF YEARS LEFT

11:11.538 --> 11:13.606
TO TAKE PHOTOS
AND LICK STAMPS,

11:13.707 --> 11:16.043
BUT LET'S FACE IT--

11:16.143 --> 11:18.846
DEATH IS JUST

11:18.946 --> 11:21.381
THE OFFICIAL
ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.217
THE SHOW'S OVER.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.220
SO YOU DON'T
WANT YOUR FAMILY
TO SHOW CONCERN.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.457
YOU DON'T WANT
FRIENDS OR A THERAPIST

11:30.557 --> 11:33.994
TO OFFER YOU SUPPORT
OR NOSTRUMS.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.832
YOUR LIFE'S OVER,
LIKE DEAN'S.

11:38.932 --> 11:42.602
- IS THAT WHAT YOU REALLY THINK?
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME, PAUL?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.337
BETTER YET,

11:44.437 --> 11:47.174
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME?

11:47.274 --> 11:51.178
THE FIRST TIME I WALKED
IN HERE, WHAT DID
YOU THINK I WAS?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.014
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.249
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
A PIECE OF SHIT
WHO DIDN'T CARE

11:56.349 --> 11:58.685
IF HIS PRODUCTS
WERE KILLING INFANTS.

11:58.786 --> 12:02.355
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
GREEDY, INSENSITIVE,

12:02.455 --> 12:03.824
A SON OF A BITCH.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.959
YOU FEEL THAT I'VE JUDGED
YOU FROM THE BEGINNING?

12:06.059 --> 12:10.563
PAUL, I TOLD YOU
I CAN'T STAND FAKE
FUCKING HUMAN BEINGS.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.466
DON'T PATRONIZE ME
AND DON'T LIE TO ME.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.369
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF THAT THIS WEEK.
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.872
THE TRUTH IS
I'M ANGRY.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.775
YEAH. I'M SURPRISED
AT THAT REACTION,

12:21.875 --> 12:25.578
BUT I AM. I'M ANGRY
AT WHAT THEY DID TO YOU

12:25.678 --> 12:27.680
AND I'M ANGRY
AT THE WAY THEY DID IT.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.383
I THINK YOU'RE
A MAN OF INTEGRITY.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.253
I'M NOT GOING THROUGH
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
OBVIOUSLY.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.523
BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND
YOUR SENSE OF ANGER,

12:36.623 --> 12:39.426
YOUR SENSE OF BETRAYAL.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.669
I TEACH--
OR TAUGHT--

12:49.769 --> 12:52.705
CLASSES
IN BUSINESS SCHOOLS

12:52.806 --> 12:55.642
ON CORPORATE
RESPONSIBILITY.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.577
I GUESS
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.680
THEY'D BRING ME IN
AS A GUEST LECTURER

13:00.780 --> 13:02.682
AND I'D LOOK
AT ALL THOSE KIDS

13:02.782 --> 13:04.918
WHO'D ALL GONE
TO BIZ SCHOOL

13:05.018 --> 13:07.687
FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS,
AND I KNEW I HAD

13:07.787 --> 13:11.992
AN HOUR TO MAYBE REACH
ONE OR TWO OF THEM.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.897
TO TRY TO GET THEM
TO UNDERSTAND THAT
A COMPANY'S NAME,

13:16.997 --> 13:20.533
A PRODUCT'S REPUTATION
IS ALL THAT YOU HAVE.

13:20.633 --> 13:25.005
THAT IF YOU LOSE YOUR NAME,

13:25.105 --> 13:28.175
YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.113
DO YOU FEEL THAT
YOU'VE LOST THAT NOW?

13:33.213 --> 13:36.149
WELL, I DIDN'T LOSE IT.
IT WAS TAKEN FROM ME.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.052
YOU MEAN
BY THE DONALDSONS?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.554
YOU-- YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED
THEIR PART IN ALL THIS.

13:41.654 --> 13:46.093
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
MR. DONALDSON'S
OLD WORLD, LIKE ME.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.929
HE GOT SCARED.
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.565
BUT ISN'T LOYALTY
PART OF BEING...

13:52.665 --> 13:54.534
OLD WORLD?

13:54.634 --> 13:56.536
IT'S NOT JUST
THE OLD MAN NOW.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.072
HE STILL HAS
HIS WITS ABOUT HIM,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.108
BUT THE DAUGHTERS
ARE INVOLVED

14:01.208 --> 14:03.510
AND THE GRANDKIDS
AND THE FUCKING LAWYERS

14:03.610 --> 14:05.512
AND PUNKS LIKE JACE.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.680
YOU KNOW, THEY PUT
HIM IN CHARGE.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.083
BUT YOU SAID THAT
THE FAMILY, I THINK,

14:10.183 --> 14:12.752
HAS A MAJORITY INTEREST
IN THE COMPANY.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.621
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

14:14.721 --> 14:19.192
SO IT WASN'T JUST THE PRESS
OR THE PARASITES WHO
FORCED YOU OUT.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.828
THE DONALDSONS HAD
TO GO ALONG WITH IT.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.899
THEY HAD--
CREDIT MARKET'S
DRYING UP.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.700
THE STOCK WAS
IN THE TANK--

14:27.800 --> 14:29.903
WELL, EVERYBODY'S STOCK
IS IN THE TANK NOW,

14:30.003 --> 14:32.339
BUT THIS WAS CARNAGE.

14:32.439 --> 14:37.144
THE MINUTE THEY GAVE ME UP,
THE STOCK GAINED IT ALL BACK.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.512
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO THEM LATELY?

14:39.612 --> 14:43.250
THE OLD MAN,
HE COULD BARELY LOOK
AT ME AT THE MEETING.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.286
I WENT OVER
TO HIM AFTER--

14:46.386 --> 14:49.622
AFTERWARDS

14:49.722 --> 14:53.060
AND I THANKED HIM
FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES
HE'D GIVEN ME AND...

14:53.160 --> 14:56.529
HE SAID,
"GOOD LUCK, WALTER."

14:56.629 --> 15:00.367
- THAT WAS IT.
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED FOR THIS MAN?

15:02.502 --> 15:05.072
35 YEARS.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.708
YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME IN,
HIS SON JAMES WAS--

15:08.808 --> 15:10.677
( sighs )

15:10.777 --> 15:12.312
WELL, HE WAS RECKLESS.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.115
THE OLD MAN ASKED ME
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.750
JAMES WAS HIS ONLY SON.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.620
AND A FEW YEARS LATER,
JAMES WENT WEST

15:20.720 --> 15:24.191
TO LOOK FOR SOME
NEW MARKETS.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.627
AND ONE NIGHT HE DROVE
HIS CAR INTO A TREE.

15:29.196 --> 15:32.232
RIGHT AWAY THE SHARKS
STARTED CIRCLING THE COMPANY.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.567
THE OLD MAN WAS
BARELY HANGING ON.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.171
BUT I TOLD HIM
NOT TO GIVE IN.
I PROMISED HIM

15:38.271 --> 15:41.041
THAT WE WOULD BUILD
SOMETHING SPECIAL,

15:41.141 --> 15:43.543
AND WE DID.
WE DID.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.879
ARE YOU SAYING YOU TURNED HIM
INTO ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN
IN THE COUNTRY?

15:46.980 --> 15:50.817
- I DID OKAY TOO.
- AND AFTER 35 YEARS

15:50.917 --> 15:53.920
ALL HE HAS TO SAY
IS GOOD LUCK?

15:54.021 --> 15:56.023
WELL, HE SAID
ONE OTHER THING

15:56.123 --> 15:57.790
BEFORE HE WISHED ME
GOOD LUCK.

15:57.890 --> 16:01.261
HE-- HE SAID,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.130
"THEY TELL ME NATALIE'S
IN RWANDA.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.132
WHAT THE HELL IS
SHE DOING OVER THERE?"

16:05.232 --> 16:06.899
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE MEANT BY THAT?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.801
I THINK THAT WAS
HIS WAY OF SAYING

16:08.901 --> 16:10.903
THAT I'D DUG
MY OWN GRAVE.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.472
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.841
YOU SAID YOURSELF
LAST WEEK: IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CRISIS

16:14.941 --> 16:18.511
I IGNORED MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO THE DONALDSONS AND
TO THE COMPANY.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.914
I ALSO REMEMBER SAYING
THAT THERE WERE TWO CRISES,

16:22.015 --> 16:24.017
ONE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER
AND ONE HERE.

16:24.117 --> 16:28.121
AND WE TALKED ABOUT
THE WAY YOU EXPERIENCED
YOUR DAUGHTER'S DISTANCE,

16:28.221 --> 16:31.224
HOW THAT ANXIETY MIGHT
HAVE COLORED YOUR JUDGMENT.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.593
SO YOU'RE
AGREEING WITH ME.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.928
I MISREAD
BOTH SITUATIONS.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.898
MY JUDGMENT WAS BAD.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.602
PERHAPS YOUR GOING AWAY
DID CONTRIBUTE TO THIS
SITUATION EXPLODING.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.937
WE KNOW ON SOME LEVEL
THAT YOUR BODY HAD BEEN

16:45.038 --> 16:47.974
TRYING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG--

16:48.075 --> 16:51.344
YOUR-- YOUR INSOMNIA
TO THE PANIC ATTACKS.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.246
BY GOING TO NATALIE
WHEN YOU DID,

16:53.346 --> 16:56.249
YOU WERE TRYING TO BRING
THIS CRISIS TO A HEAD.

16:58.918 --> 17:03.523
NO, IT WAS ALREADY
PAST THAT POINT.

17:03.623 --> 17:07.160
JACE WAS A CANCER I SHOULD
HAVE CUT OUT LONG AGO.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.563
I TRUSTED
THE WRONG PEOPLE,

17:10.663 --> 17:12.932
THE WRONG LABS.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.135
UNDER MY WATCH

17:15.235 --> 17:18.905
THIS-- THIS POISON GOT
INTO THE PIPELINE

17:19.005 --> 17:20.540
AND ONTO THE SHELVES.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.042
BUT YOU ISSUED A RECALL
THE MINUTE YOU FOUND OUT.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.078
WELL...

17:25.178 --> 17:28.315
THE PAPERS--
THE ONES MY WIFE
WON'T LET ME READ--

17:28.415 --> 17:31.984
THEY'RE-- THEY'RE ALL
SAYING KIDS DIED

17:32.085 --> 17:33.753
AND IT WAS MY FAULT.

17:33.853 --> 17:38.758
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
- NATALIE THINKS SO TOO.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.194
WHEN SHE EMAILED
CONNIE YOU COULD TELL
SHE THOUGHT I WAS

17:41.294 --> 17:44.697
SOME SORT OF
CORPORATE CRIMINAL.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.933
YOU SAID I THINK YOU'RE GUILTY,
THE PAPERS THINK SO,

17:47.033 --> 17:50.303
- NOW YOU'RE SAYING NATALIE--
- IT'S NOT PARANOIA, PAUL,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.172
IF THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE GOING.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.574
PART OF YOU BELIEVES YOU DID
EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD

17:54.674 --> 17:57.310
PROPERLY AND PART OF YOU
IS PUNISHING YOURSELF

17:57.410 --> 18:00.513
FOR NOT DOING MORE.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.857
I'M OKAY DURING THE DAY
MOST DAYS.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.227
BUT AT NIGHT I WAKE UP
IN A COLD SWEAT,

18:14.327 --> 18:17.430
WONDERING HOW I MISSED IT,
WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE,

18:17.530 --> 18:21.268
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE,
HOW MUCH HURT I'VE CAUSED

18:21.368 --> 18:24.171
TO FAMILIES,
TO THE COMPANY.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.774
GOD, IF YOU COULD SEE
THE OLD MAN'S FACE.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.309
HE LOOKED STRICKEN.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.144
THAT MUST HAVE MADE
YOU FEEL TERRIBLE,

18:31.244 --> 18:33.480
TO DISAPPOINT
THE OLD MAN.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.116
WHAT?

18:38.651 --> 18:41.388
YOU SEEM TO TALK
ABOUT HIM AS IF HE'S...

18:41.488 --> 18:43.823
A FATHER THAT
YOU'VE LET DOWN.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.193
IT'S MY FAULT,
PAUL, NOT HIS.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.996
I SEE YOU STRUGGLING
TO UNDERSTAND

18:50.096 --> 18:52.064
WHAT HAPPENED
AND WHY IT HAPPENED.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.467
BUT AS HARD
AS YOU'RE WORKING

18:54.567 --> 18:57.237
TO DEAL WITH THIS GUILT,
THIS SENSE OF BETRAYAL,

18:57.337 --> 19:00.340
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
YOU'RE WORKING JUST AS HARD

19:00.440 --> 19:03.410
TO AVOID LOOKING AT HIM
AND HIS ROLE IN THIS.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.045
WHY DO YOU KEEP
HARPING ON HIM?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.547
HE DID THE BEST
HE COULD.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.849
YOU SAID THAT
WHEN HIS SON JAMES DIED,

19:09.949 --> 19:13.486
OLD DONALDSON WAS READY
TO JUST GIVE IT ALL UP.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.756
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LET HIM.
YOU TOOK ON THE FAMILY BUSINESS

19:16.856 --> 19:18.291
FOR 35 YEARS.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.193
THEIR SON WAS DEAD.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.229
AND DID YOU FEEL
GUILTY ABOUT THAT?

19:22.329 --> 19:25.765
WELL, I'D PROMISED
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.567
AND SO FOR WHAT,
SOME PENANCE

19:27.667 --> 19:30.637
YOU TOOK ON THIS
ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY?

19:30.737 --> 19:33.540
THE SAME WAY THAT
YOU TOOK RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR PARENTS' LIVES

19:33.640 --> 19:36.576
- AFTER YOUR BROTHER
TOMMY DIED?
- I HAD NO CHOICE.

19:36.676 --> 19:40.112
- WALTER, YOU WERE JUST A BOY.
- I HAD NO CHOICE.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.783
YOU WERE SIX YEARS OLD.
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN YOUR TIME
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PARENTS.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.420
- THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
TAKING CARE OF YOU.
- IT WAS MY FAULT!

19:47.520 --> 19:51.057
THAT'S WHY
I HAD NO CHOICE--
IT WAS MY FAULT.

19:51.157 --> 19:54.227
WHAT WAS
YOUR FAULT, WALTER?

20:09.208 --> 20:12.745
A HOT SUMMER NIGHT,
BEFORE AIR CONDITIONING.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.849
THE AIR WAS
DEAD STILL.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.854
TOMMY WAS JUST
GOING TO SNEAK OUT
TO THE QUARRY LAKE TO COOL OFF.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.093
HE CAME TO MY ROOM

20:27.193 --> 20:30.297
AND SAID TONIGHT
WAS THE NIGHT

20:30.397 --> 20:33.232
HE WAS GOING TO JUMP OFF
THE HIGHEST CLIFF.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.870
BUT HE WAS ASKING ME, REALLY,
MORE THAN TELLING ME.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.641
AND WHAT DID
YOU TELL HIM?

20:41.741 --> 20:44.877
( tearfully )
I SAID, "TOMMY,
YOU CAN DO IT.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.481
YOU CAN DO IT, TOMMY."

20:50.149 --> 20:51.984
AND I TOLD HIM
IN THE MORNING

20:52.084 --> 20:55.322
I'D BRAG ABOUT HIM
TO EVERYONE.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.461
THEN HE KISSED ME
GOOD NIGHT.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.932
HE NEVER MADE IT BACK.

21:06.032 --> 21:09.101
AND YOU FELT RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR BROTHER'S DEATH.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.538
I WAS. I AM.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.106
WALTER,
YOUR BROTHER JUMPED.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.975
YOU DIDN'T PUSH HIM
OFF THE EDGE.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.645
HE CHOSE TO JUMP.

21:18.745 --> 21:22.482
AND IN A FLASH
A FAMILY WAS DESTROYED.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.619
THAT'S IT.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.221
IT HAPPENS.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.558
THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM--

21:32.459 --> 21:35.428
DESTROYED FAMILIES.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.905
ARE YOU OKAY,
WALTER?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.208
( sniffles )
I HAVE TO GO.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.878
LOOK, I KNOW THIS WEEK
YOUR SENSE OF GUILT
ABOUT ALL THIS,

21:51.978 --> 21:55.147
IT MUST FEEL
LIKE AN AVALANCHE.
I KNOW YOU MUST

21:55.247 --> 21:57.884
FEEL OVERWHELMED,
BUT IT'S URGENT

21:57.984 --> 22:00.420
THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS
FEELING IN HERE.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.422
MY WIFE'S WAITING
FOR ME OUTSIDE.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.191
CAN WE ARRANGE SOMETHING
FOR TOMORROW MORNING?

22:05.291 --> 22:08.828
SOMETIMES IF I'M UP ALL NIGHT,
I NEED THE MORNINGS TO SLEEP.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.399
WHAT ABOUT
MONDAY AFTERNOON?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.967
I'M FINE, FELLA.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.605
DO YOU MIND IF I CALL
YOUR DOCTOR AND...

22:18.705 --> 22:21.641
- TALK ABOUT
THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS?
- I SAID I'M FINE.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.046
I'LL--

22:27.146 --> 22:29.616
I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK, WALTER.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.051
MY WIFE'S WAITING
FOR ME OUTSIDE.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.562
( melancholy music playing )
