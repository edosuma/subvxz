WEBVTT

01:34.086 --> 01:38.182
Regina, I am prepared to depart.
Have my project brought up.

01:38.311 --> 01:39.783
<i>Yes, Mr. Wenan.</i>

01:54.470 --> 01:57.733
Billy, I just got word

01:57.862 --> 02:01.126
that your father will not be
joining us for Christmas.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.686
Oh, I know, sweetie.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.598
It's... his work.

02:06.726 --> 02:07.686
It's unfortunate.

02:07.814 --> 02:10.534
I was really looking
forward to seeing John.

02:10.662 --> 02:15.270
I'm sorry that I won't be able
to be there for you today.

02:15.399 --> 02:17.765
It's okay, Grandma.

02:18.118 --> 02:19.270
Come here.

02:22.150 --> 02:24.134
You know what would
look good here?

02:24.934 --> 02:27.429
Another ribbon.

02:27.557 --> 02:29.894
Bring home the blue,
Billy.

02:30.022 --> 02:32.998
I will, Grandmother,
because that's what winners do.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.045
Oh, that's my boy.

02:35.173 --> 02:37.957
And we'll send a picture
to your father afterwards.

02:38.086 --> 02:39.526
Hmm?

02:43.174 --> 02:45.541
Please be a dear
and get me a glass of milk.

02:45.669 --> 02:47.046
Of course, Grandma.

02:47.174 --> 02:48.549
Thank you.

02:57.543 --> 02:59.910
- Regina.
- Yes, Mr. Wenan.

03:00.037 --> 03:02.438
I need this letter
mailed overnight.

03:02.566 --> 03:03.973
Of course.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.989
I'll be back in
approximately four hours.

03:06.118 --> 03:07.653
Otherwise, I can be reached
on my phone.

03:07.781 --> 03:10.054
Oh, and, um, Regina,

03:10.182 --> 03:12.230
Grandmother would like
a glass of milk.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.022
Of course, sir.

03:49.670 --> 03:51.366
Working something out,
love?

03:51.877 --> 03:53.062
Yeah.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.942
I finished up early
on the day's orders,

03:56.070 --> 03:57.830
so I figured
I'd get in some practice.

03:57.958 --> 04:00.774
This is our lowest year
on record.

04:00.903 --> 04:04.485
Yeah, we've had slumps before.
It'll pick back up.

04:05.253 --> 04:07.878
And the supply bill
next month?

04:08.006 --> 04:09.766
We can't run up
any more credit.

04:12.005 --> 04:13.318
Try not to worry.

04:13.446 --> 04:15.877
Just trying to keep things
in perspective.

04:16.582 --> 04:17.670
I'll head
into town tomorrow

04:17.797 --> 04:19.270
and check on the late entries.

04:19.398 --> 04:20.613
I'll look at the PO box.

04:20.741 --> 04:22.533
They've assured me
our check's in the mail.

04:22.661 --> 04:23.942
All right.

04:24.070 --> 04:25.990
I'll make cookies
for the drive.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.582
That'd be nice.

04:28.710 --> 04:31.110
You have fun
shooting the trash.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.806
Yes, ma'am.

04:46.533 --> 04:48.774
<i>Yes?</i>

04:48.902 --> 04:51.078
Hi, uh, it's Donald.
Is this, uh...

04:59.814 --> 05:00.965
Hi.

05:01.478 --> 05:02.214
Merry Christmas.

05:02.342 --> 05:04.773
Do you have
something for me?

05:04.901 --> 05:07.717
Uh, yeah.
Yes. Yes, I do.

05:17.478 --> 05:19.878
Well, walk over here
and bring it to the table.

05:20.006 --> 05:23.270
Uh... yeah. Um...

05:23.941 --> 05:25.286
On the mat.

05:38.822 --> 05:43.366
So, uh, how long does this
usually take?

05:43.494 --> 05:45.606
As long as it takes.

05:49.925 --> 05:51.558
Is there a place
I can sit?

05:51.686 --> 05:54.342
Does it look like there's
someplace that you can sit?

05:57.414 --> 05:59.270
Does this belong to you?

05:59.398 --> 06:03.078
Uh, yeah. I got it for
Christmas when I was 11.

06:09.414 --> 06:12.390
Eleven. Eleven.
That's great.

06:12.518 --> 06:15.334
You know, I never got
what I asked for.

06:16.646 --> 06:18.661
Are you
a baseball player?

06:18.789 --> 06:20.966
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I am.

06:22.342 --> 06:23.430
You're an athlete?

06:23.558 --> 06:24.934
I mean, I was.

06:25.062 --> 06:29.734
I, uh, blew my ACL out in
college, like, 15 years ago.

06:29.862 --> 06:32.070
- Why are you selling it now?
- I don't really wanna.

06:32.198 --> 06:37.254
But my little girl wants to go to
space camp, so, uh, we can't afford it.

06:37.382 --> 06:41.958
What do you think
your childhood dream is worth?

06:45.190 --> 06:46.598
2,000.

06:47.686 --> 06:49.894
I'll give you
$900 for it.

06:50.950 --> 06:53.766
That's not even
gonna get me halfway there.

06:53.894 --> 06:57.382
I will give you $900 for
it or you can fuck off.

07:06.437 --> 07:08.998
Hydroelectric power
is an abundant energy source

07:09.126 --> 07:11.206
and the underlying thesis
of my project.

07:11.334 --> 07:14.150
- How long did this take you?
- Two weeks of conceptualizing

07:14.278 --> 07:15.494
and ten days
of actual building.

07:15.622 --> 07:17.190
How'd you come up
with this?

07:17.318 --> 07:20.390
After I realized the amount of
power within a flowing water source,

07:20.518 --> 07:22.086
the rest was elementary.

07:22.214 --> 07:24.198
Congratulations,
Christine.

07:24.325 --> 07:28.262
Oh, you have made Chester Elementary very proud.

07:37.222 --> 07:39.846
You just beat four-time champion
Billy Wenan. What do you have to say?

07:39.974 --> 07:41.638
I couldn't have asked for
a better Christmas present.

07:41.766 --> 07:43.942
Thank you to everyone,
especially my mom and dad.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.638
- Congrats again.
- Thank you.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.910
- Billy!
- Excuse me, Judge Robinson, I think I got the wrong...

07:48.038 --> 07:50.694
Oh, we've got, uh,
Billy right here.

07:50.821 --> 07:52.773
Let's get a shot
with the runner-up.

07:52.902 --> 07:54.502
All right, let's get
the runner-up out here.

07:54.630 --> 07:56.678
- I've got the wrong...
- Come on. Hold that ribbon up high.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.277
You two get snuggly.
Look at me.

07:58.406 --> 08:01.061
Pretend like there's a little
squirrel's nest on my head.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.837
Bye, Billy!
Have a good Christmas!

08:17.477 --> 08:19.494
- Roger.
- Yes, Mr. Wenan.

08:20.326 --> 08:22.662
I have some more work
for that friend of ours.

08:22.789 --> 08:24.422
I'll put you in contact,
sir.

08:24.549 --> 08:26.086
Thank you.

09:30.886 --> 09:32.454
All right, I can talk.

09:32.582 --> 09:34.502
What exactly
does this entail?

09:35.974 --> 09:38.854
I see.
All right, uh...

09:39.845 --> 09:41.798
You got a name?

09:44.934 --> 09:46.405
How much?

09:48.710 --> 09:51.334
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

09:52.038 --> 09:54.054
Job accepted.

09:54.182 --> 09:57.062
I gotta go.
I'm on another gig.

10:13.767 --> 10:16.933
<i>...we ask ourselves the real question.
Is Santa making a difference anymore?</i>

10:17.062 --> 10:19.045
<i>Here we have a story
out of North Carolina.</i>

10:19.174 --> 10:21.062
<i>Two children said
they were just having fun</i>

10:21.190 --> 10:23.237
<i>when they dropped a bowling
ball off the Hickerson overpass.</i>

10:23.367 --> 10:24.998
<i>This caused a 30-car pileup.</i>

10:25.126 --> 10:27.110
<i>Next hour, we're gonna be
talking to an Oregon man who says</i>

10:27.238 --> 10:30.278
<i>a group of schoolchildren
burned his house to the ground.</i>

10:54.917 --> 10:56.326
Merry Christmas, Chris.

10:56.454 --> 10:59.429
Ah, schoolkids are lighting
their uncles on fire

10:59.558 --> 11:02.886
and throwing bowling balls
off of bridges.

11:03.013 --> 11:05.254
Nothing too merry
about that.

11:08.838 --> 11:11.045
Got two more crates
for you in back.

11:12.197 --> 11:13.669
I'll bring the truck around.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.366
All right,
I'll get 'em ready.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.893
Hey, Chris.

11:26.758 --> 11:28.069
Ralph.

11:28.198 --> 11:30.054
I got a whole lot
of presents under the tree.

11:30.182 --> 11:32.069
You could come over later
and unwrap a couple early.

11:32.198 --> 11:35.014
- Hmm. I might be...
- Hold that thought.

11:35.814 --> 11:38.469
Sorry about that, Chris.
What can I get ya?

11:38.598 --> 11:39.718
Johnny Carson.

11:39.845 --> 11:42.534
Not in your usual
chipper mood today.

11:42.662 --> 11:46.278
Went a whole two seconds and I haven't
heard anything about the decline of society

11:46.405 --> 11:48.006
or the reckless youth
in America.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.957
I guess I'm just having
a good day.

11:51.365 --> 11:55.078
Wishin' and waitin' isn't
gonna change what's inside.

11:56.165 --> 11:58.502
Gotta get another whiskey
from the back.

12:16.038 --> 12:17.381
Can I help you?

12:17.511 --> 12:19.109
How are ya, Mike?

12:21.221 --> 12:22.342
Don't think I know you.

12:22.471 --> 12:25.126
Nicole and the kids are well,
I hope.

12:31.814 --> 12:34.373
Look, uh, I wasn't gonna
do anything...

12:34.502 --> 12:37.926
Oh, I've known Sandy since she was a kid.
She's a great girl.

12:38.053 --> 12:40.294
But she never did hold
much faith in wedding vows.

12:40.421 --> 12:42.757
- Not like you and me, Mike.
- Listen, I'm...

12:42.886 --> 12:44.165
I'm just here having a drink.
I'm not...

12:44.295 --> 12:46.278
You know, if you drive
straight through...

12:47.045 --> 12:50.278
I reckon you could be home
in 12 hours,

12:50.406 --> 12:52.102
spend the holiday
with your family.

12:52.231 --> 12:53.573
Who are you?

12:53.702 --> 12:57.445
Well, I'm... I'm the guy
that's gonna buy you a beer.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.485
Why don't you hop?
I'll take care of it.

13:03.942 --> 13:06.949
And Mike, drive safe.

13:17.895 --> 13:18.886
Where's Mike?

13:19.878 --> 13:21.735
- Who?
- The good-looking guy

13:21.862 --> 13:24.069
that was sitting right next
to where your fat butt is.

13:24.198 --> 13:27.302
Oh, that fella.
Well, I guess he left.

13:27.430 --> 13:32.262
Why is it every time you come in
here, I end up going home alone?

13:32.773 --> 13:34.597
Maybe I'm a jinx.

13:35.878 --> 13:36.838
Yeah.

14:06.277 --> 14:09.702
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, ma'am. I'm a reporter with <i>The Times.</i>

14:09.831 --> 14:12.518
<i>Oh, that's a wonderful paper.</i>

14:12.646 --> 14:13.957
Yes, it is.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.165
I feel very privileged
to be a part of it.

14:16.294 --> 14:18.853
- <i>How can I help you?</i>
- Yesterday, we ran an article

14:18.982 --> 14:20.773
on your school's
science fair...

14:21.606 --> 14:23.014
and I had a few
follow-up questions

14:23.142 --> 14:25.765
for the "Best of Show,"
Christine Crawford.

14:25.894 --> 14:28.357
I was hoping I could get
her contact information.

14:28.486 --> 14:30.373
<i>No problem
I can get that for you.</i>

14:30.502 --> 14:32.582
Fantastic.

14:36.485 --> 14:38.566
<i>Just gonna be
one more second.</i>

14:39.302 --> 14:40.390
Great.

14:45.415 --> 14:47.974
I brought your milk.

14:48.102 --> 14:49.894
Oh, thank you, honey.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.462
Put it here.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.759
You should be resting.

14:54.886 --> 14:57.702
Let's get these outta your way.

14:58.918 --> 15:00.454
On the desk.

15:11.398 --> 15:12.709
Mm.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.589
- Night.
- Good night.

15:15.718 --> 15:18.598
- I love you.
- I love you too.

15:22.502 --> 15:25.189
- Regina!
- Yes, Mr. Wenan.

15:25.318 --> 15:27.462
Grandmother wants everyone
out of the house right now.

15:27.591 --> 15:28.837
Certainly, sir.

16:33.606 --> 16:35.559
Mmm, you know...

16:36.486 --> 16:39.077
I've never lost
a science competition.

16:45.318 --> 16:48.453
Did you know a circuit
is only as good as its ground?

16:50.182 --> 16:52.870
Billy, I-I thought that your science proj...

16:52.998 --> 16:56.583
Twelve-volt car battery.

16:57.031 --> 16:59.013
Might not kill you,

16:59.141 --> 17:01.157
but it'll make
your teeth chatter.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.173
You're gonna return
the first-place ribbon

17:03.303 --> 17:07.239
and tell them you were unfairly
helped with that train project.

17:08.422 --> 17:09.541
You cheated.

17:13.606 --> 17:16.389
You don't deserve to win.

17:18.213 --> 17:19.205
Am I being clear?

17:26.149 --> 17:27.494
Get her outta here.

17:44.038 --> 17:45.543
Ah.

17:46.918 --> 17:48.742
They arrived about
20 minutes ago.

17:48.871 --> 17:52.454
Yeah. Hope they brought
the other half of our check.

17:52.582 --> 17:55.366
Stay calm. You exploding
is not gonna help anything.

17:55.495 --> 17:58.918
No, but it'll make me feel better.

18:00.453 --> 18:01.702
Oh.

18:02.501 --> 18:03.718
Good to see you,
Chris.

18:03.846 --> 18:05.990
Apologies about springing
this visit on you.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.558
Why don't we drop
the pleasantries?

18:07.686 --> 18:09.606
It's my busiest time of year,
and I got work to do.

18:09.734 --> 18:12.390
- Now, where's the rest of my money?
- I'm Captain Jacobs.

18:12.519 --> 18:15.813
- We've got a proposition for you.
- No propositions, no shakes.

18:15.941 --> 18:18.022
I want what's due.
And this? This is half.

18:18.150 --> 18:21.862
Well, you only produced
half of last year's product,

18:21.990 --> 18:25.413
and, uh, the subsidy payment
reflects that.

18:25.541 --> 18:29.030
Well, this is Christmas. We're not
handing out participation trophies.

18:29.158 --> 18:32.454
I can't help it if half the kids
deserve coal instead of presents.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.790
We got a minimum budget.
It's in our contract.

18:34.918 --> 18:38.758
Well, actually, your contract with the
United States government, um, states,

18:38.885 --> 18:42.821
"Subsidy payment is dependent on
volume of presents made and delivered."

18:42.949 --> 18:44.869
And that's exactly
how you've been paid.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.943
This won't even
cover the power.

18:48.070 --> 18:51.238
We have employees to pay,
food to buy,

18:51.365 --> 18:53.638
and quite frankly,
this is one...

18:54.150 --> 18:55.878
humdinger of a time

18:56.006 --> 18:57.606
to lay this burden on us.

18:57.734 --> 19:00.870
The point is,
with only half our payment,

19:00.997 --> 19:02.758
we're not gonna
be able to survive.

19:02.885 --> 19:06.054
We understand the financial
constraints that you're suffering.

19:06.183 --> 19:08.837
No one wants to shut you down,
not if we don't have to.

19:08.966 --> 19:11.557
Do you even understand
what you're saying?

19:11.686 --> 19:13.255
What you'd be doing
to Christmas?

19:13.381 --> 19:16.166
We want your holiday spirit.
It generates holiday spending.

19:16.293 --> 19:18.150
Let's not get into
all that right now.

19:18.277 --> 19:19.975
I mean,
the important thing is,

19:20.101 --> 19:22.503
we might have a chance
to work this out.

19:23.815 --> 19:25.989
Captain, if you please.

19:26.502 --> 19:28.454
Chris, Ruth,

19:28.582 --> 19:31.813
the United States military would
like to procure your services.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.245
You know what happens
if I hear you talked, right?

19:42.918 --> 19:44.293
No.

19:44.422 --> 19:45.990
I'll kill your mommy.

19:46.117 --> 19:48.230
I'll kill your daddy.

19:48.838 --> 19:50.214
You got a dog?

19:50.758 --> 19:51.973
Yeah.

19:52.102 --> 19:54.183
What's your dog's name?

19:54.918 --> 19:56.934
J-Jo Jo Beans.

19:57.063 --> 20:00.070
Well, I will kill
ol' Jo Jo Beans too.

20:02.278 --> 20:04.518
Now
you're gonna go in there

20:04.646 --> 20:06.405
and say that you were
at the mall

20:06.534 --> 20:08.583
and you lost track
of time.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.077
You were buying them some
Christmas presents. You got it?

20:11.206 --> 20:12.838
I don't have
any Christmas pre...

20:12.965 --> 20:16.294
Well, maybe you were thinking about
buying them some Christmas presents.

20:20.902 --> 20:23.750
Remember,
two nights from now,

20:23.878 --> 20:26.854
Santa's gonna slide his
fat ass down your chimney

20:26.982 --> 20:28.550
and give you
a whole bunch of presents

20:28.678 --> 20:30.822
'cause you've been such
a good girl this year.

20:31.686 --> 20:34.149
You know, he doesn't
do that for everyone.

20:36.965 --> 20:38.310
Here's your phone.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.381
Christine.

20:52.806 --> 20:54.502
Merry Christmas.

21:06.982 --> 21:08.581
Thanks, love.

21:11.814 --> 21:14.758
You think they're serious about
shutting down the factory?

21:15.494 --> 21:17.317
Nah, they're just
trying to bully us

21:17.446 --> 21:19.173
into a contract.

21:19.302 --> 21:21.414
You sure about that?

21:23.142 --> 21:24.806
We could use
the extra income.

21:24.933 --> 21:26.694
Oh, I'm aware.

21:26.821 --> 21:29.062
Doesn't have
to come from them though.

21:31.046 --> 21:32.390
No.

21:32.518 --> 21:34.790
Why, no, it doesn't.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.830
I'm glad I thought of it.

21:39.942 --> 21:41.446
Hmm.

21:41.574 --> 21:44.294
Well, I'm calling you on
Christmas Eve, so you know it's serious.

21:44.422 --> 21:47.430
I mean, I thought we did
a great job for you back in '98.

21:47.558 --> 21:48.870
My team is fast.

21:48.997 --> 21:51.494
And you know
they do quality work, right?

21:53.765 --> 21:55.430
Well, no.

21:55.558 --> 21:57.702
No, no, I can't beat that.

21:57.830 --> 22:01.062
But if you're getting it that cheap, you've
gotta be sacrificing something somewhere.

22:05.317 --> 22:07.558
I'm sorry to hear that,
Lee Ning.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.494
Yes, have a good day. Bye.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.406
Lee Ning, out.

22:26.086 --> 22:29.478
Elon, this is Chris.
What do you got for me?

22:31.750 --> 22:35.814
I bid on everything from
mainframes to Pez dispensers.

22:35.941 --> 22:37.893
Everybody's outsourcing.

22:39.430 --> 22:44.422
They got six-year-olds pulling
12-hour shifts in bare feet

22:44.550 --> 22:46.182
for two sticks
of bubble gum.

22:46.310 --> 22:48.070
It's heartbreaking.

22:48.197 --> 22:51.429
You're exhausted, and you've got
a long night of delivering gifts.

22:51.558 --> 22:53.702
Why don't you get some rest
before you go out?

22:53.830 --> 22:56.101
You still got
a little bit of time.

22:56.229 --> 22:58.246
I can't sleep.

22:58.374 --> 23:00.966
The whole damn operation
is goin' tits up.

23:05.254 --> 23:07.590
- Chris.
- <i>Chris, the sleigh's packed and ready to go.</i>

23:07.718 --> 23:09.158
I'll be right there.

23:10.854 --> 23:13.638
- Let me see it.
- Hold on. I'm almost finished.

23:13.765 --> 23:15.526
Let me...
Just give me the list.

23:15.654 --> 23:17.349
Have you checked it?

23:17.478 --> 23:19.269
Come on. It's fine.

23:26.054 --> 23:27.974
Why are you being
like this?

23:30.661 --> 23:32.230
'Cause I failed.

23:41.318 --> 23:42.406
Hey!

23:42.534 --> 23:45.030
- You forgetting something?
- Oh.

23:49.382 --> 23:52.006
- I'll keep hold of this for you.
- Oh, come on.

23:52.134 --> 23:54.278
It's 15 below out here.

23:54.406 --> 23:56.166
Then have hot chocolate.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.101
All right.

26:11.430 --> 26:12.710
How'd it go?

26:12.838 --> 26:15.142
- I survived.
- Mmm.

26:17.029 --> 26:19.334
Merry Christmas, darling.

27:14.117 --> 27:18.502
You just messed
up big time, fat man!

27:18.629 --> 27:19.685
Go!

27:42.502 --> 27:45.382
Hot damn. That was
a course record.

27:46.053 --> 27:47.462
Let's run it again.

27:47.590 --> 27:50.695
I was, uh, hoping to, uh,
get to my son's place

27:50.822 --> 27:53.829
and see the grandkids opening
presents this morning.

27:57.221 --> 28:00.517
Are you not being
compensated for your time?

28:00.646 --> 28:03.271
Oh, y-yeah, yeah. Sure.

28:03.397 --> 28:05.127
Well, is that
not enough for you?

28:05.253 --> 28:06.790
No, uh, it is.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.614
Good.

28:08.741 --> 28:10.309
Then let's run it again.

28:32.007 --> 28:33.157
Is there a problem?

28:33.286 --> 28:34.918
<i>I've got a job for you.</i>

28:35.046 --> 28:36.966
- Good.
- <i>I think you're gonna like it.</i>

28:37.093 --> 28:39.269
<i>It complements
that hobby of yours.</i>

28:39.398 --> 28:40.742
What's the job?

28:44.069 --> 28:46.502
I'd like you
to kill Santa Claus.

28:49.287 --> 28:51.111
Really?

28:51.238 --> 28:53.573
<i>I know he let you down too.</i>

28:54.151 --> 28:55.685
Well, uh...

28:56.358 --> 28:57.798
that's not gonna be easy.

28:57.927 --> 29:00.902
<i>Well, if you're not interested,
I'm sure I could find s...</i>

29:01.029 --> 29:02.662
No, I'm interested.

29:03.173 --> 29:05.189
I'm very interested.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.782
<i>Hello. Davis here.</i>

29:15.910 --> 29:17.830
Ah, good morning.
This is Chris.

29:17.958 --> 29:20.133
- <i>Chris, good morning.</i>
- I'll do the contract.

29:20.262 --> 29:21.766
<i>Oh, that's fantastic!
That's great.</i>

29:21.895 --> 29:25.222
- Ye... Yeah. Yeah, well, yes.
- <i>Let's get together...</i>

29:25.349 --> 29:27.622
Well, m-merry... merry Christmas.

29:27.751 --> 29:31.302
The one day you get to sleep
in, and you're up early.

29:31.431 --> 29:33.255
Well, I had
a heavy mind.

29:35.749 --> 29:37.925
I just agreed
to the contract.

29:38.055 --> 29:40.709
- It's what we have to do, love.
- I know.

29:41.478 --> 29:42.918
What is it?

29:43.047 --> 29:46.021
Oh, some kids with a deer
rifle put some flak in the air.

29:46.149 --> 29:47.815
- Again?
- Yeah.

29:47.941 --> 29:51.430
Put two holes in the sleigh, one in me.
Even tore my bag.

29:51.558 --> 29:54.022
Don't worry about the bag.
Let me see your side.

29:54.149 --> 29:56.262
I'm all right. It's...
It's fine, it's fine.

29:56.391 --> 29:58.278
It'll heal
in the usual way.

30:00.805 --> 30:02.885
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

30:04.326 --> 30:06.855
Maybe it's time
I retired the coat.

30:06.982 --> 30:10.021
You just need a break.
We're all feeling it this year.

30:10.149 --> 30:11.846
I've lost
my influence.

30:11.973 --> 30:14.758
You're an icon.
People love you.

30:14.886 --> 30:16.966
I'm a silly, fat man
in a red suit.

30:17.093 --> 30:20.613
I mean, you think it's cute, but this
is what people actually think of me.

30:20.742 --> 30:22.853
Christmas is a farce.
I am a joke.

30:22.982 --> 30:25.413
There hasn't been any real
spirit of the season anymore.

30:25.542 --> 30:26.789
Not for years.

30:26.919 --> 30:28.709
Let's just get
a few days out on this.

30:28.839 --> 30:30.437
That will give you
a better perspective.

30:30.565 --> 30:32.326
I should've charged them
royalties for my image.

30:32.453 --> 30:34.502
- Now, that's what we should've done.
- That's not who we are.

30:34.630 --> 30:38.309
No, we're only the largest economic
stimulus in the entire world.

30:38.439 --> 30:40.902
Christmas generates
$3 trillion in the US alone.

30:41.029 --> 30:43.270
We can't pay our power bill.
Think there's something wrong with that?

30:43.398 --> 30:45.702
Oh, is that how
we're measuring success now?

30:45.829 --> 30:47.493
Well, that's what
they care about.

30:47.622 --> 30:52.709
They put up with us so they can
sell their toys and sodas and cars.

30:52.839 --> 30:53.895
We're a business.

30:54.022 --> 30:56.133
And don't kid yourself, Ruth.

30:56.262 --> 30:59.173
Altruism is not a deductible
on their bottom line.

30:59.302 --> 31:02.117
Don't put it all on them.
You've changed too.

31:03.526 --> 31:05.029
You might be right.

31:06.053 --> 31:08.005
Maybe I'm just like 'em.

31:09.126 --> 31:10.853
You still have it.

31:12.869 --> 31:17.830
All I have is a loathing
for a world that's forgotten.

31:25.575 --> 31:27.462
Thanks for the cigars.

31:54.085 --> 31:56.358
- <i>Information. Can I help you?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:56.486 --> 31:58.375
I need to get ahold of somebody
in the North Pole.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.863
<i>I'm not able to search without
a specific country or code.</i>

32:01.990 --> 32:06.341
Okay. All right, uh, then what's
the closest thing to the North Pole?

32:06.469 --> 32:08.389
Something... Something
arctic, in the Arctic Circle.

32:08.518 --> 32:11.590
<i>Unfortunately, I don't know. If you
could be more specific, I could help you.</i>

32:11.718 --> 32:15.109
Well, is there a city up there,
an island, anything?

32:15.238 --> 32:17.446
A chunk of ice
floating in the fucking ocean?

32:17.575 --> 32:19.430
<i>I can't stay on if you're
gonna talk like that.</i>

32:19.558 --> 32:21.222
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cuss.

32:21.350 --> 32:23.749
- Please don't hang up.
- <i>I want to help you. If you could be more specific.</i>

32:23.878 --> 32:26.406
Okay, uh,
what about the city of...

32:26.533 --> 32:28.710
of Eureka
on Ellesmere Island?

32:28.839 --> 32:31.782
- <i>Okay, I have it.</i>
- Great, great.

32:31.910 --> 32:34.630
Do you have a listing
for Christopher Cringle?

32:34.758 --> 32:36.901
Hello?

32:37.766 --> 32:39.909
Hello?

32:40.037 --> 32:42.438
Why did you
hang up the fucking phone?

32:51.333 --> 32:52.935
Just relax.

33:01.638 --> 33:02.695
Back to basics.

33:10.246 --> 33:12.295
- Damn! Shit.
- I broke it.

33:12.421 --> 33:13.318
- I broke it.
- Jesus.

33:32.455 --> 33:34.501
May I get another pot of tea?

33:49.510 --> 33:52.454
Mr. Wenan.
This package came for you.

33:52.582 --> 33:54.949
From your father
for Christmas.

33:59.557 --> 34:00.999
It's a few days late.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.341
Yes, sir.

34:03.589 --> 34:05.095
From the Bahamas?

34:05.221 --> 34:07.269
That's what it says,
sir.

34:07.397 --> 34:10.149
He's probably there with
his girlfriend, Kara.

34:11.013 --> 34:12.486
I wouldn't know, sir.

34:13.925 --> 34:16.422
Well, pass it to me.

35:40.293 --> 35:42.438
Where the hell are you?

36:22.533 --> 36:23.718
Hey.

36:24.358 --> 36:25.638
Where do the, uh...

36:25.766 --> 36:28.070
the letters
to Santa go?

36:28.198 --> 36:30.213
You know, the letters the
children write to Santa Claus?

36:30.341 --> 36:31.814
- What happens to 'em?
- Yeah, yeah. H-36.

36:31.942 --> 36:34.534
Uh, it's a... it's a bin
down at the office.

36:34.662 --> 36:37.893
- Right. What happens to 'em after that?
- Uh, I don't know.

36:38.021 --> 36:39.877
Guess you could ask Weyland,
our district super.

36:40.006 --> 36:41.254
Weyland? You know
where I could find him?

36:41.382 --> 36:43.366
Yeah, downtown office,
just off Redding Street.

36:43.494 --> 36:44.613
- Redding?
- Yeah.

36:44.741 --> 36:47.270
- Great. Thank you.
- No problem.

36:47.398 --> 36:48.806
Have a good day.

37:01.925 --> 37:03.206
Morning.

37:03.813 --> 37:06.246
Sorry.
This is my first day.

37:06.374 --> 37:08.677
Know where I can find
Supervisor Meeks's office?

37:18.150 --> 37:19.590
Um...

37:20.038 --> 37:21.702
can I help you?

37:22.886 --> 37:25.318
I'm looking
for the fat man.

37:25.446 --> 37:26.374
Where is he?

37:26.502 --> 37:27.942
Excuse me?

37:28.678 --> 37:30.918
Santa Claus,
motherfucker.

37:32.774 --> 37:34.629
Come on, Weyland.

37:34.758 --> 37:36.326
Don't act stupid.

37:36.453 --> 37:40.261
Just give me the address and
I'll walk right out of here.

37:43.558 --> 37:45.318
Where do you send the letters?

37:45.446 --> 37:47.366
Okay, just take it easy.

37:50.182 --> 37:52.550
Look,
I can't give you an address because...

37:52.678 --> 37:54.246
Shh.

37:54.374 --> 37:56.645
I can't give you an
address because I don't have one.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.438
Then you just sorted
your last piece of mail.

37:58.565 --> 38:00.166
No, no, no, no.
I just...

38:00.294 --> 38:03.718
Look, it's a classified program.
They give me a PO box and that's it.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.414
I don't know anything else.
I swear to you.

38:05.542 --> 38:08.229
We just crate up the letters
and send them out.

38:10.502 --> 38:11.686
Write it down.

38:12.870 --> 38:14.502
- Write it down.
- Okay.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.294
Okay.

38:17.350 --> 38:18.950
To the right.

38:19.078 --> 38:20.166
Other way.

38:26.694 --> 38:28.806
Not that page.
Use a blank one.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.350
Okay.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.430
- Slow down. Make it legible.
- Fuck.

38:37.318 --> 38:38.470
Okay?

38:45.190 --> 38:48.582
- You gotta be shitting me.
- No, no, no. It's the truth. I swear it.

38:54.406 --> 38:57.510
So, uh, what now?

38:59.782 --> 39:01.126
Well...

39:01.989 --> 39:03.398
that's it.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.157
Son of a...

39:48.742 --> 39:50.278
<i>Hello?</i>

39:50.406 --> 39:51.942
We're a go.

39:52.070 --> 39:54.726
- I'll be on the road by midnight.
- <i>Sounds good.</i>

39:54.854 --> 39:56.806
<i>Keep me updated
on your progress.</i>

41:08.198 --> 41:10.054
They'll understand.

41:11.749 --> 41:13.542
They shouldn't have to.

41:14.758 --> 41:17.191
Can I assume
they speak English?

41:17.318 --> 41:22.342
Our work requires that they
speak many different languages.

41:22.470 --> 41:24.998
Let's just get this
over with.

41:34.982 --> 41:38.822
All right, everyone.
Quiet down now. Let's quiet down.

41:44.678 --> 41:48.966
- Is everybody here?
- We're all here and accounted for, sir.

41:51.590 --> 41:53.638
Well, firstly, uh,

41:53.766 --> 41:56.902
I'm sorry to call you
all back so early.

41:57.030 --> 41:59.845
But I'm sure you're all
excited to get cracking

41:59.974 --> 42:03.718
and get working again
on next year's Christmas season.

42:11.590 --> 42:16.358
And you're probably wondering about
all the new faces around here today.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.974
Well,
as you already know...

42:21.894 --> 42:26.278
there is a rising number of our
youth making poor decisions.

42:28.006 --> 42:32.422
Now, this has unfortunately
caused our yearly subsidy

42:32.550 --> 42:35.142
to be well below
our current budget.

42:36.871 --> 42:39.205
Now, to make up
for that shortfall...

42:41.862 --> 42:46.022
we are fulfilling a two-month
contract with the US military.

42:54.182 --> 42:58.502
Now, I know this must come
as a shock to a lot of you.

42:58.630 --> 43:01.926
Believe me,
had there been any other way...

43:06.278 --> 43:08.326
This is Captain Jacobs.

43:09.351 --> 43:10.662
Captain Jacobs'll fill you in

43:10.789 --> 43:13.413
on a lot of the changes
that are going on around here.

43:13.542 --> 43:14.918
Thank you.

43:19.206 --> 43:22.086
I am going to go over
some rules

43:22.213 --> 43:24.358
that must be followed
without exception

43:24.485 --> 43:26.662
and throughout the duration
of this engagement.

43:26.791 --> 43:31.174
These rules are for your safety,
and your safety alone.

43:31.301 --> 43:34.246
Number one,
you will be fingerprinted,

43:34.375 --> 43:38.054
- assigned a security badge to be worn at all times.
- Next.

43:38.182 --> 43:41.669
Number two, you must enter
and exit the factory floor

43:41.798 --> 43:43.718
through the
southern bay doors only.

43:43.846 --> 43:48.006
Number three, you must remove
the bells from your uniforms

43:48.133 --> 43:50.695
as they will set off
our metal detectors.

43:50.822 --> 43:55.109
In addition to these rules,
we will be upgrading the site's security.

43:55.782 --> 43:57.573
Do you have any questions?

43:58.918 --> 43:59.974
Yes.

44:00.101 --> 44:02.311
What kind of toys
are we making, sir?

44:02.437 --> 44:03.782
Not toys, miss.

44:03.910 --> 44:06.982
Control panels for
America's eagle in the sky,

44:07.111 --> 44:09.734
our FJ-63 fighter jets.

44:17.926 --> 44:19.813
What's the purpose
of your visit?

44:20.455 --> 44:23.206
Recreation. Hunting.

44:23.335 --> 44:25.382
I'm gonna kill some things.

44:27.622 --> 44:29.509
You fill out the 5589?

44:29.638 --> 44:33.413
Yes, ma'am,
I have my 5589...

44:33.862 --> 44:36.902
my 4457,

44:37.029 --> 44:39.782
and my 3177 right here.

44:58.213 --> 44:59.462
All right.

44:59.590 --> 45:00.966
Welcome to Canada.

45:01.414 --> 45:02.853
Good to be here.

45:44.935 --> 45:47.815
Holy Christ, Corporal,
you call that hammering?

45:48.485 --> 45:50.727
Show a little pride
in your work.

45:50.853 --> 45:52.102
Here. You're up.

45:54.245 --> 45:55.909
Holy hell.

45:56.038 --> 45:58.406
Soldier, get your sorry ass
out of that lift.

45:58.533 --> 46:00.135
Clean that shit up.

46:13.798 --> 46:15.269
Hey, partner. Here.

46:15.398 --> 46:16.837
Hang on to this.

46:30.886 --> 46:32.229
Thank you.

46:32.902 --> 46:34.246
Steroids.

46:40.741 --> 46:43.045
I come in peace.

46:43.174 --> 46:44.806
Thank you.

46:59.655 --> 47:01.575
Morning, 7.
How's everybody holding up?

47:01.702 --> 47:04.966
Very well, sir. We got the
line up and running last night.

47:05.093 --> 47:07.621
- Right now we're optimizing.
- Oh, yeah.

47:07.749 --> 47:09.925
Okay, optimizing.
I see.

47:10.053 --> 47:11.845
19, 23,
how are you doing?

47:11.973 --> 47:14.151
- Wonderfully perfect, sir.
- Uh, super-duper good.

47:14.278 --> 47:16.870
Ah, I appreciate
the positivity.

47:16.998 --> 47:17.926
Are you buying that?

47:18.055 --> 47:19.815
Absolutely, boss.

47:19.942 --> 47:23.013
I really backed you into a corner on this
one, 7. Don't think I don't know that.

47:23.142 --> 47:25.861
The order calls for a lot of
product in a short amount of time.

47:25.989 --> 47:29.701
Yeah, it's gonna be a squeaker even if
everything goes perfect. Refill, thanks.

47:29.829 --> 47:31.013
Which it never does.

47:31.142 --> 47:32.837
When have you seen it
go perfect?

47:32.965 --> 47:35.398
- 1910 was close.
- There was a bad war that year.

47:35.526 --> 47:36.549
You can't blame
yourself.

47:36.677 --> 47:39.175
- I'll go check the crew.
- The office.

47:39.301 --> 47:40.678
Oh, one more thing.

47:40.806 --> 47:42.373
7...

47:42.502 --> 47:45.189
this is make or break
for us.

47:45.317 --> 47:48.646
I don't need to tell you that
absolutely everything is on the line.

47:49.638 --> 47:52.294
Christmas is at stake, sir.
We won't let you down.

47:52.422 --> 47:55.558
- We'll have the order finished on time.
- Good man.

47:55.686 --> 47:58.119
Chris, I just
talked to my superiors.

47:58.246 --> 48:00.326
They're very impressed with
the numbers that I gave them.

48:00.453 --> 48:03.685
They're sending in a couple of suits
to have a look at the operation.

48:03.814 --> 48:05.862
It's a very impressive
group of...

48:06.726 --> 48:08.646
little workers
you've got here.

48:08.775 --> 48:09.735
Real hard workers.

48:10.951 --> 48:13.126
I'd like to use the break
room, if that's possible.

48:13.253 --> 48:15.686
I'm running an eight-man
rotation, four on at all times.

48:15.813 --> 48:18.821
Me or one of my men are gonna be
inside the factory 24 hours a day.

48:18.949 --> 48:20.837
How does that
sit with you, 7?

48:20.965 --> 48:23.686
We can take our breaks
in the cafeteria.

48:23.813 --> 48:25.990
Many thanks to you.
Captain Jacobs.

48:26.118 --> 48:27.589
- 7.
- 7?

48:27.718 --> 48:29.638
We're all ranked and
accounted for by number.

48:29.766 --> 48:31.015
It's more efficient
that way.

48:31.141 --> 48:32.966
7's our factory foreman.

48:33.093 --> 48:34.213
What happened to
1 through 6?

48:34.342 --> 48:36.229
Well, we've been at this
a long time.

48:36.358 --> 48:38.278
We don't reissue numbers.

48:38.406 --> 48:41.223
That would be unethical
and dishonorable.

48:42.214 --> 48:43.110
I like it.

48:43.239 --> 48:44.997
That's a hell of
a way to run a crew.

48:45.126 --> 48:48.613
Would you like a cookie,
Captain Jacobs?

48:49.222 --> 48:50.501
Indeed.

48:51.717 --> 48:53.253
A hell of a way
to run a crew.

48:53.381 --> 48:54.663
Excuse me.

48:59.622 --> 49:00.678
Mmm.

49:01.861 --> 49:03.109
Wow.

49:15.333 --> 49:16.902
You all right, buddy?

49:30.693 --> 49:33.797
The hamster hammock is a top
seller and this, the roller.

49:33.926 --> 49:36.453
Then we have
the seesaw.

49:36.581 --> 49:39.271
Nibblers and
the pet playhouse.

49:39.397 --> 49:41.542
There's no room
for the pet playhouse.

49:41.670 --> 49:44.422
You know, it's funny.
You don't strike me as a hamster person.

49:44.550 --> 49:47.686
- Well, I am.
- You seem more like a... a reptile person.

49:47.815 --> 49:49.861
Do you like lizards?

49:51.238 --> 49:52.711
I have a great selection
of chameleons.

49:52.837 --> 49:54.821
I don't want a chameleon.

49:56.358 --> 49:57.541
Snakes.

49:57.669 --> 50:00.453
That's it.
You're a snake person.

50:01.413 --> 50:03.110
Snakes eat hamsters.

50:03.238 --> 50:05.477
You know, lots of people don't know
what kind of pet person they are,

50:05.606 --> 50:07.526
but I'm really good
at this.

50:08.326 --> 50:10.630
You know, you remind me
a lot of my mother.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.101
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:12.229 --> 50:13.830
She wasn't
a good listener,

50:13.957 --> 50:16.997
and she never knew
when to shut the fuck up.

50:19.749 --> 50:21.094
Thank you.

50:38.598 --> 50:40.166
Here you go, fellas.

50:46.726 --> 50:47.749
- Hi.
- Hey.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.094
Mr. Cringle.

50:49.222 --> 50:51.397
We had a hell of a time
finding this place.

50:51.526 --> 50:53.477
Asked around town,
but no one had a clue.

50:53.606 --> 50:55.975
Yeah, as you can imagine,
it has to be that way.

50:56.101 --> 50:57.286
And we think
it's a good thing.

50:57.414 --> 50:59.173
Great thing.
Yeah, I'm Lex Taylor.

50:59.302 --> 51:02.086
- This is, uh, Carter Mapplethorpe.
- I know who you are.

51:02.214 --> 51:04.263
Right. They warned us
about that.

51:04.390 --> 51:06.693
Things were a little touch-and-go
for a couple of years.

51:06.821 --> 51:08.326
Weren't they, Carter?

51:10.597 --> 51:12.613
Whoa, hey, hey.

51:12.742 --> 51:14.854
Oh, that's Donner.
He gets a mite nippy.

51:14.982 --> 51:17.446
You're lucky it wasn't Blitzer.
She'd tear your package right off.

51:17.574 --> 51:20.101
Well, have a look around, fellas.

51:20.229 --> 51:21.958
7, my shop foreman,

51:22.085 --> 51:23.686
will show you anything
you might need to see.

51:23.815 --> 51:25.925
We, uh, don't need to have
a look around, Chris.

51:26.053 --> 51:28.550
No, we've seen the numbers,
we've seen the samples,

51:28.678 --> 51:30.438
and the work you do
is exceptional.

51:30.566 --> 51:33.733
The military would like to procure
your services on an annual basis.

51:33.862 --> 51:35.878
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

51:36.006 --> 51:40.934
We are prepared to guarantee
your subsidization for 15 years.

51:41.670 --> 51:43.718
I hear
what you're saying,

51:43.846 --> 51:45.670
but this is a one-time deal,
gentlemen.

51:45.798 --> 51:49.190
How about you wait until you get that
check on the first of next month,

51:49.318 --> 51:52.454
and then we'll see if you
don't have a change of heart.

51:52.582 --> 51:53.990
That's not gonna happen.

51:54.118 --> 51:57.030
I appreciate your optimism,
sir, I-I really do,

51:57.158 --> 52:00.038
but with all due respect,
I think both of us know

52:00.166 --> 52:03.558
that there's a very good chance you're
gonna end up right back here next year.

52:04.261 --> 52:05.670
And then maybe,
Mr. Cringle,

52:05.798 --> 52:09.061
- the deal we offer won't be so sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

52:09.958 --> 52:11.302
I'll keep
some axle grease handy

52:11.430 --> 52:13.638
just in case
I change my mind.

52:17.350 --> 52:18.246
Okay.

52:44.006 --> 52:46.054
<i>But will the president do that?</i>

52:46.182 --> 52:48.198
<i>I think he already is.</i>

52:56.197 --> 52:58.149
Sit tight.
Be right back.

53:09.030 --> 53:10.597
You get this
for Christmas?

53:10.726 --> 53:12.902
Yeah, Santa gave it to me.

53:14.630 --> 53:16.389
You must be a good kid.

53:17.285 --> 53:18.886
I guess so.

53:19.014 --> 53:22.438
You know what I got for
Christmas when I was your age?

53:25.798 --> 53:29.318
You never forget the smell of
burning flesh and menthols.

53:35.942 --> 53:37.926
Give you
a hundred bucks for it.

53:42.726 --> 53:43.750
150.

54:37.893 --> 54:40.038
Your workers sure have
healthy appetites.

54:41.765 --> 54:44.262
You know, I can't help but think
the smallness and discoloration

54:44.390 --> 54:47.174
is a direct result of
an inadequate diet.

54:47.302 --> 54:48.646
Inadequate?

54:49.702 --> 54:50.822
Please elaborate.

54:50.950 --> 54:52.966
Well, I think
what you need is some...

54:53.094 --> 54:55.910
protein, vegetables, fiber.

54:56.038 --> 54:59.814
I bet if we gave some
real food to these people,

54:59.941 --> 55:01.989
they would shoot up
like bean stalks.

55:02.118 --> 55:05.733
Captain, we have discovered the most
efficient and productive way to eat

55:05.862 --> 55:07.749
is simple carbs
and sugars

55:07.878 --> 55:08.806
six times a day.

55:08.934 --> 55:10.790
But that's unnatural.

55:10.918 --> 55:12.774
The body needs
four food groups,

55:12.902 --> 55:15.526
regular exercise,
a minimum of six hours of sleep.

55:15.654 --> 55:19.622
Oh, every elf takes a 20-minute
nap every eight hours.

55:19.750 --> 55:23.622
That keeps our bodies fresh and allows
us to work on a 24-hour rotation.

55:24.230 --> 55:25.830
How long can you keep that up?

55:25.958 --> 55:27.174
Indefinitely.

55:27.302 --> 55:29.733
It's why elves live
much longer than humans.

55:31.942 --> 55:34.662
- And Chris? He does the same?
- No.

55:34.790 --> 55:37.157
It's the giving
that keeps him young.

57:26.758 --> 57:30.278
Thought I'd head into town
tomorrow to check the PO box.

57:31.430 --> 57:34.118
I'm gonna feel a lot better
with that check in my hand.

57:34.246 --> 57:35.910
I'm with you there.

57:37.318 --> 57:39.558
Thanks for these.

57:40.134 --> 57:42.725
We have each other's backs.

57:42.854 --> 57:44.741
That's how this works.

57:44.870 --> 57:48.358
Remember when my baking went
through the vegan, sugar-free phase?

57:48.485 --> 57:49.478
Oh, yeah.

57:50.053 --> 57:51.718
I was lucky
to survive it.

57:51.878 --> 57:53.733
Must've lost 12 pounds.

57:53.862 --> 57:57.702
But you told me, even though you knew
I wouldn't be thrilled to hear it.

57:57.829 --> 58:00.486
That may have been more of
a self-preservation thing.

58:00.613 --> 58:05.413
Point is, we both have
good days and bad days.

58:05.542 --> 58:08.678
We disagree.
We tick each other off.

58:08.806 --> 58:12.775
Like when you come into the house
dripping sweat all over the floor,

58:12.902 --> 58:16.390
using my good towels
for sweat rags.

58:18.726 --> 58:20.487
But I love you.

58:20.613 --> 58:22.181
So we figure it out,

58:22.310 --> 58:24.230
we work through it,

58:24.358 --> 58:26.117
we lift each other up.

58:28.966 --> 58:32.198
- I'm feeling downright inspired.
- Good!

58:32.326 --> 58:34.951
Let's hope that inspiration
starts with a shower.

58:35.078 --> 58:36.614
Mm. That... That bad?

58:36.742 --> 58:38.438
Yes.

58:38.566 --> 58:39.526
- Really?
- Hmm.

58:39.655 --> 58:40.998
- No chance?
- Oh, God.

58:41.125 --> 58:42.949
I got to talk you into this?

58:43.078 --> 58:45.606
- How about I... Oh, okay. All right.
- Just... Just go. Go.

59:07.527 --> 59:09.478
Afternoon.

59:09.606 --> 59:11.558
Hope the new year
is treating you well.

59:11.686 --> 59:15.077
Only a couple of days in,
but I'm optimistic.

59:23.206 --> 59:25.541
Can I help you
with anything?

59:25.671 --> 59:27.205
Yeah.

59:28.006 --> 59:29.733
I'm, uh...

59:30.598 --> 59:32.646
looking for
a friend of mine.

59:33.351 --> 59:34.471
This is his box.

59:34.597 --> 59:36.295
What box you lookin' at?

59:36.422 --> 59:37.669
323.

59:37.798 --> 59:39.207
You a friend of Chris's?

59:39.333 --> 59:41.031
Yeah.

59:41.158 --> 59:44.838
Yeah, we, uh, we did some
business a couple of years back.

59:44.967 --> 59:47.302
Wanted to look him up,
but I misplaced his contact information.

59:47.429 --> 59:49.062
I was hoping maybe
you could help me out.

59:49.189 --> 59:52.198
Well, sadly, don't think
I'm gonna be able to.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.190
Really?

59:58.629 --> 1:00:00.422
Oh, that's, uh...

1:00:01.158 --> 1:00:02.598
that's very disappointing.

1:00:02.725 --> 1:00:04.231
I've come a long way.

1:00:05.222 --> 1:00:09.574
No, can't say he ever gave us
any contact information.

1:00:10.502 --> 1:00:12.389
You don't even have
his last name?

1:00:12.518 --> 1:00:15.174
Been that way
since I can recall.

1:00:17.125 --> 1:00:19.717
- Hey, there, Sandy.
- Hey, Herman.

1:00:19.846 --> 1:00:22.022
I gotta get this thing
out to Palm Beach double-time.

1:00:22.150 --> 1:00:24.517
Hold on a sec
while I help this gentleman.

1:00:24.646 --> 1:00:26.437
Let's have you
leave a message.

1:00:26.566 --> 1:00:28.102
Chris comes in
every couple of days.

1:00:28.231 --> 1:00:29.798
That's all right.

1:00:31.781 --> 1:00:35.109
Say, does, uh,
Chris still drive that green Chevy?

1:00:35.686 --> 1:00:37.606
- Red Ford.
- Right.

1:00:37.735 --> 1:00:39.173
I meant Ford.

1:00:50.725 --> 1:00:52.870
I don't like duck canvas.

1:00:53.478 --> 1:00:56.166
Way too much going on.

1:00:56.293 --> 1:00:59.238
Too many sticks.
I'm not a fucking tree.

1:01:00.037 --> 1:01:01.575
Too puffy.

1:01:02.118 --> 1:01:04.102
Tan makes me look fat.

1:01:04.229 --> 1:01:06.278
Green is fucking stupid.

1:01:07.142 --> 1:01:09.286
Maybe you could give me some idea

1:01:09.415 --> 1:01:11.557
of what
you're looking for.

1:01:14.151 --> 1:01:15.301
What about that one?

1:01:15.429 --> 1:01:16.902
Great coat.

1:01:17.031 --> 1:01:20.229
I can see you're a man who
appreciates a quality garment.

1:01:21.574 --> 1:01:22.469
Hmm.

1:02:00.421 --> 1:02:01.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:02:02.118 --> 1:02:04.102
Status report.

1:02:04.231 --> 1:02:06.662
Getting warmer,
so to speak.

1:02:07.782 --> 1:02:08.838
<i>I was thinking.</i>

1:02:08.966 --> 1:02:12.711
I'm putting a lot
into this venture financially,

1:02:12.838 --> 1:02:14.470
and I'd like
to retain a keepsake.

1:02:14.598 --> 1:02:16.358
What did you have in mind?

1:02:17.926 --> 1:02:19.462
I want the big man's head.

1:02:19.591 --> 1:02:22.119
<i>That could be problematic.</i>

1:02:22.246 --> 1:02:25.862
- Are you saying no?
- I'm saying that it's not practical.

1:02:26.629 --> 1:02:28.038
Severed heads are fickle.

1:02:28.166 --> 1:02:30.982
They rot, they mold,
they smell.

1:02:31.111 --> 1:02:34.981
It's a multi-day trip across two international
borders and several state lines,

1:02:35.109 --> 1:02:37.989
which means a sizable cooler,
frequent stops

1:02:38.117 --> 1:02:40.711
and putting myself
at considerable risk.

1:02:40.837 --> 1:02:42.822
And I don't do that
for anyone.

1:02:43.749 --> 1:02:44.965
Then I want his beard.

1:02:45.094 --> 1:02:48.198
I'm not shaving off
a dead man's beard.

1:02:50.055 --> 1:02:52.935
How about some, uh...
some sleigh bells?

1:02:53.062 --> 1:02:54.469
No.

1:02:55.141 --> 1:02:56.838
Okay. Uh...

1:02:57.862 --> 1:02:59.269
What about his coat?

1:03:00.133 --> 1:03:02.631
Fine.
Bring the coat.

1:03:02.758 --> 1:03:04.069
Great.

1:03:04.198 --> 1:03:06.149
All right, I gotta go
back to work now.

1:03:06.279 --> 1:03:08.262
Keep me abreast
of your progress.

1:03:10.629 --> 1:03:12.039
You fucking prick.

1:03:55.813 --> 1:03:57.829
Hey, Sandy.
How's the day?

1:03:57.958 --> 1:03:59.461
What's got you
in such a good mood?

1:03:59.589 --> 1:04:01.669
Well, I found
something I lost.

1:04:01.798 --> 1:04:05.638
- Hmm.
- Uh, it's too early for all of that.

1:04:05.766 --> 1:04:08.166
- Well, then what'll you have?
- I just dropped in to say hello.

1:04:08.293 --> 1:04:11.463
And if it's not too much trouble,
maybe a glass of milk for the road.

1:04:11.590 --> 1:04:13.735
- Milk.
- Yep.

1:04:14.695 --> 1:04:17.766
- Want me to warm it up for you?
- That'd be nice.

1:04:31.206 --> 1:04:32.775
Oh, man.

1:04:54.533 --> 1:04:56.710
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Herman. How you doing?

1:04:57.926 --> 1:04:59.622
I'm good.

1:05:00.838 --> 1:05:03.142
Now, Chris, there was a guy
in here looking for you.

1:05:03.270 --> 1:05:05.478
- Oh, yeah?
- Out-of-towner.

1:05:07.270 --> 1:05:08.326
Ah.

1:05:09.893 --> 1:05:11.878
Fancy suit?
Government-type?

1:05:12.006 --> 1:05:14.725
- Couldn't find his ass in the seat of his pants?
- Yep, that's him.

1:05:14.854 --> 1:05:17.253
- Yeah, I'm working with him.
- That's what he said.

1:05:17.381 --> 1:05:20.197
Hmm.
Well, thanks, Herman.

1:05:20.326 --> 1:05:22.503
You have a good one.

1:05:22.630 --> 1:05:24.293
You, too, Chris.

1:07:25.574 --> 1:07:28.518
- Is Captain Jacobs down below?
- Yes, sir, he is.

1:07:54.982 --> 1:07:56.741
"We'd like to extend
our sincerest apologies.

1:07:56.870 --> 1:07:58.661
Christine Crawford
has admitted she cheated.

1:07:58.790 --> 1:08:01.670
Enclosed is the award
for first place."

1:08:41.701 --> 1:08:43.142
Fuck.

1:08:53.926 --> 1:08:56.902
- I'm actually looking forward to seeing my ex-wife.
- What?

1:08:57.030 --> 1:09:00.101
- Yeah, I think we're gonna get back together.
- You're brave, man.

1:09:00.230 --> 1:09:01.925
Yeah.

1:09:02.726 --> 1:09:04.422
What the hell was that?

1:09:12.870 --> 1:09:14.118
It's a ski.

1:09:24.069 --> 1:09:25.414
Dennis.

1:09:47.077 --> 1:09:48.678
How'd it go?

1:09:50.694 --> 1:09:52.230
I got it.

1:09:55.334 --> 1:09:56.838
How's that knittin' going?

1:09:57.318 --> 1:09:58.438
Done.

1:09:58.565 --> 1:10:02.534
Well, it seems like
an opportune time

1:10:02.662 --> 1:10:05.766
to try it out,
don't you think?

1:10:05.894 --> 1:10:08.165
- Right now?
- Why not?

1:10:09.222 --> 1:10:11.334
Got some heft.

1:10:12.933 --> 1:10:14.342
Ah.

1:10:17.222 --> 1:10:19.238
- Now...
- Ooh.

1:10:20.198 --> 1:10:21.605
Ah.

1:10:22.406 --> 1:10:23.525
Fine work.

1:10:23.654 --> 1:10:25.606
A slight miscalculation.

1:10:26.566 --> 1:10:29.030
Probably a little
stress-knitting.

1:10:29.158 --> 1:10:31.141
Oh, we always wanted
a bigger bed.

1:10:32.101 --> 1:10:34.021
There's the man I married.

1:10:35.109 --> 1:10:37.606
Ruthie,
I want to apologize.

1:10:39.398 --> 1:10:42.886
I lost perspective and lately,
I've been a little...

1:10:43.814 --> 1:10:47.174
self-absorbed and not much
of a partner to you.

1:10:47.974 --> 1:10:50.405
There's been a lot of talk
about quitting,

1:10:50.534 --> 1:10:52.358
and, well,
that's not who we are.

1:10:53.190 --> 1:10:54.726
Or, it's not who I am
and...

1:10:55.622 --> 1:10:56.454
I'm sorry.

1:10:56.582 --> 1:10:59.462
We've been at this
a long time, love.

1:10:59.590 --> 1:11:00.518
This isn't easy.

1:11:00.646 --> 1:11:02.310
We knew it wouldn't be
when we started.

1:11:02.438 --> 1:11:04.806
I guess I just let it
get away from me.

1:11:04.934 --> 1:11:07.110
Then let's take it back.

1:11:07.238 --> 1:11:09.126
We need to do that.

1:11:13.126 --> 1:11:14.246
You found me.

1:11:14.373 --> 1:11:15.622
<i>This is Captain Jacobs,
over.</i>

1:11:15.750 --> 1:11:17.349
What can I do for you,
Captain?

1:11:17.478 --> 1:11:19.718
<i>I just followed up with the
brass on your supply requests.</i>

1:11:19.846 --> 1:11:21.445
<i>Had them put
a double-time on it.</i>

1:11:21.574 --> 1:11:22.598
Good.

1:11:22.726 --> 1:11:23.717
<i>Say again?</i>

1:11:24.550 --> 1:11:27.526
- Affirmative.
- <i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>

1:11:27.654 --> 1:11:29.318
- Come here.
- Why?

1:11:29.446 --> 1:11:32.230
Well, maybe I just
want to embrace my wife.

1:11:32.357 --> 1:11:34.054
- Oh, is that all?
- Hmm.

1:11:34.182 --> 1:11:35.686
What's wrong with that,
Mrs. Cringle?

1:11:35.814 --> 1:11:38.150
I thought you wanted me
to mend your bag.

1:11:38.278 --> 1:11:39.941
Yeah, I do.

1:11:40.070 --> 1:11:41.798
But, um, later.

1:13:05.318 --> 1:13:08.230
What are you thinking?

1:13:08.357 --> 1:13:10.471
I'm thinking,

1:13:10.598 --> 1:13:13.702
you know, the good
does outweigh the bad.

1:13:13.830 --> 1:13:15.014
Mm-hmm.

1:14:14.374 --> 1:14:15.430
Hey.

1:14:19.686 --> 1:14:21.062
Hey.

1:14:22.085 --> 1:14:23.558
Hey, uh...

1:14:24.549 --> 1:14:26.662
Just take it easy,
little fella.

1:14:26.790 --> 1:14:28.326
Okay?

1:14:29.446 --> 1:14:31.525
That's not a toy.

1:14:32.358 --> 1:14:34.213
You one of
Captain Jacobs's men?

1:14:34.342 --> 1:14:37.222
Yes, I am. I'm one
of Captain Jacobs's men.

1:14:37.831 --> 1:14:39.942
So put it down
on the ground.

1:14:40.421 --> 1:14:41.766
Right now.

1:14:49.351 --> 1:14:50.854
What's this?

1:14:50.981 --> 1:14:52.135
I have no idea.

1:14:52.262 --> 1:14:54.950
What's going on?

1:15:04.711 --> 1:15:06.214
Oh, shit.

1:15:08.102 --> 1:15:11.814
Pressure, Henshaw.
Press down on it, son.

1:15:19.846 --> 1:15:21.574
Where's Chris?

1:15:25.606 --> 1:15:26.949
Shit.

1:15:31.942 --> 1:15:34.118
- Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
- They're shooting.

1:15:34.246 --> 1:15:35.782
- Who is? The soldiers?
- I-I don't know.

1:15:35.909 --> 1:15:38.629
Go. I'm initiating
barricade protocol yellow!

1:15:38.758 --> 1:15:41.605
- Get into the domestic wing!
- Go, go, go!

1:15:41.734 --> 1:15:44.518
Dobson, McCranie, Phillips.

1:15:44.645 --> 1:15:45.670
We are under fire.

1:15:45.798 --> 1:15:48.389
- Aaron, Sophie, doors, right now.
- Stay close.

1:16:07.173 --> 1:16:09.895
7, you all get your asses
ready to move.

1:16:10.022 --> 1:16:11.302
I'm getting you
outta here.

1:16:22.693 --> 1:16:23.589
Go, go, go!

1:16:31.911 --> 1:16:34.053
7! 7!

1:16:34.182 --> 1:16:35.558
Get over here!
Come on!

1:16:38.405 --> 1:16:39.655
7!

1:16:39.782 --> 1:16:41.446
7, where are you going?

1:16:42.886 --> 1:16:45.029
Oh, what now?

1:16:45.158 --> 1:16:46.533
All right. Yeah?

1:16:46.662 --> 1:16:48.070
<i>Chris!
We're under attack!</i>

1:16:48.198 --> 1:16:49.829
- 7?
- <i>Chris!</i>

1:17:00.742 --> 1:17:03.046
I'll take the Walker too.

1:17:07.846 --> 1:17:10.949
Go, go, go, go!

1:17:20.326 --> 1:17:21.991
Come on! Come on!

1:17:22.117 --> 1:17:23.686
Close the door!

1:17:25.957 --> 1:17:28.294
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

1:17:56.613 --> 1:17:58.150
Fuck!

1:18:25.446 --> 1:18:27.653
That's enough!

1:18:53.991 --> 1:18:55.558
Jonathan Miller.

1:18:56.422 --> 1:18:58.373
You twisted child.

1:19:01.446 --> 1:19:04.359
And I always thought
you forgot about me.

1:19:12.549 --> 1:19:14.086
You remember this?

1:19:15.622 --> 1:19:18.918
This was the only goddamn
thing you ever got me.

1:19:29.382 --> 1:19:34.054
After all the times
that I wrote you.

1:19:37.990 --> 1:19:39.653
I'm sorry, son.

1:19:42.151 --> 1:19:44.453
There are limits
to what I can do.

1:19:46.213 --> 1:19:48.646
I couldn't replace
your parents.

1:19:51.205 --> 1:19:52.455
Yeah.

1:19:53.478 --> 1:19:54.789
You couldn't.

1:19:58.215 --> 1:20:00.006
Well, here we are.

1:20:02.533 --> 1:20:06.469
I've come for your head,
fat man!

1:20:09.382 --> 1:20:11.141
You think
you're the first?

1:20:14.021 --> 1:20:17.829
You think I got this job
because I'm fat and jolly?

1:23:05.286 --> 1:23:07.143
Stop now! Stop!

1:23:07.270 --> 1:23:08.677
It's over.

1:25:20.678 --> 1:25:21.734
I'm sorry.

1:25:49.478 --> 1:25:50.917
Chris?

1:25:52.326 --> 1:25:54.118
Chris, love?

1:25:59.302 --> 1:26:02.405
It's okay.
Just try and relax.

1:26:55.910 --> 1:26:57.254
Helga!

1:26:58.310 --> 1:27:01.029
I'll be working in my room
for the rest of the evening,

1:27:01.158 --> 1:27:03.142
so no interruptions.

1:27:03.270 --> 1:27:04.326
Yes, Mr. Wenan.

1:27:04.454 --> 1:27:06.918
Why are you calling me
about this now?

1:27:07.045 --> 1:27:09.478
How can there be
that much missing?

1:27:09.606 --> 1:27:12.134
Oh, I want this tracked.

1:27:12.262 --> 1:27:15.014
Find out where
it was cashed.

1:27:15.142 --> 1:27:17.094
Then check my signatures.

1:27:17.221 --> 1:27:21.093
Call the bank. Tell them to
keep an eye on all my accounts.

1:27:21.222 --> 1:27:24.742
If there's a rat,
I want to snap its little neck.

1:27:47.206 --> 1:27:49.126
We'll see
who catches the rat.

1:28:02.502 --> 1:28:06.342
Damn it, Helga.
I said no interruptions.

1:28:08.102 --> 1:28:12.038
Don't you speak English?
I said stay out.

1:28:13.989 --> 1:28:15.526
Who the hell are you?

1:28:16.486 --> 1:28:17.926
I'm Ruth.

1:28:18.949 --> 1:28:21.542
And this is Chris.

1:28:32.582 --> 1:28:34.534
Billy.

1:28:35.558 --> 1:28:36.933
Well...

1:28:38.118 --> 1:28:40.262
I can't say
I'm surprised.

1:28:41.446 --> 1:28:43.045
Mmm.

1:28:52.134 --> 1:28:54.726
Yeah. Fentanyl.

1:28:55.558 --> 1:28:57.414
That'll get the job done.

1:29:03.686 --> 1:29:05.702
This is partly my fault.

1:29:06.854 --> 1:29:10.310
You know, I just haven't quite
been myself lately, have I, dear?

1:29:10.438 --> 1:29:11.845
Mm-mmm.

1:29:12.646 --> 1:29:15.974
But the time has come
to turn things around.

1:29:16.645 --> 1:29:19.781
I've decided to be proactive.

1:29:21.286 --> 1:29:23.206
And it starts with you.

1:29:26.982 --> 1:29:29.477
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1:29:31.397 --> 1:29:32.709
Ow.

1:29:55.974 --> 1:29:58.150
Now look at me, child.

1:30:01.190 --> 1:30:03.558
I said look at me.

1:30:04.838 --> 1:30:08.007
A wicked soul
bent on bloodshed

1:30:08.133 --> 1:30:09.862
was sent
to collect my head.

1:30:09.991 --> 1:30:15.846
Like you, he thought he lived
outside of morals and consequence.

1:30:17.477 --> 1:30:20.646
He is now buried
with his lack of reverence.

1:30:21.766 --> 1:30:24.005
One more time,
Billy Wenan,

1:30:24.134 --> 1:30:26.086
once more,

1:30:26.215 --> 1:30:29.605
and you'll be getting more
than coal in your stocking.

1:30:30.725 --> 1:30:33.542
If your grandmother
meets an early grave,

1:30:34.405 --> 1:30:38.022
if Christine Crawford
suffers so much as a cold,

1:30:38.149 --> 1:30:43.397
if anybody that crosses your path is made
to feel less or lower because of you...

1:30:44.742 --> 1:30:46.533
I'm coming back.

1:30:48.166 --> 1:30:52.709
I'll come while you sleep
and rip you from your covers.

1:30:52.838 --> 1:30:57.766
By my hand, you will know the
consequence of your actions.

1:31:00.133 --> 1:31:02.214
So don't screw it up.

1:31:06.054 --> 1:31:09.286
The fat man's
got his eye on you, kid.

1:31:41.031 --> 1:31:42.373
Mmm.

1:32:04.678 --> 1:32:06.790
Why don't you all take 15?

1:32:06.918 --> 1:32:08.805
Uh, I'd really
rather not.

1:32:08.935 --> 1:32:10.982
I wasn't asking.

1:32:11.109 --> 1:32:12.646
If there's one thing
I've learned, 7,

1:32:12.775 --> 1:32:14.822
it's never argue with
a woman gifting cookies.

1:32:14.949 --> 1:32:17.766
Oh, I'll tell the crew
we're on a break.

1:32:17.893 --> 1:32:20.487
Yeah. I'll take one of
those, if you don't mind.

1:32:20.613 --> 1:32:22.789
Aren't you supposed
to be taking it easy?

1:32:22.918 --> 1:32:24.038
I am.

1:32:29.478 --> 1:32:32.871
We'll have this place up in no
time, bigger and better than before.

1:32:32.998 --> 1:32:34.630
And we're gonna
keep it that way.

1:32:34.758 --> 1:32:36.325
We are.

1:32:37.062 --> 1:32:38.917
Lovely.
