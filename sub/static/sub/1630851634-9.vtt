00:18.101 --> 00:19.477
[Joe] Previously on You:

00:19.561 --> 00:21.521
[Love] Cary and Sherry
wanna sleep with us.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.859
[Joe] Opening our marriage, this loophole
cannot be falling into my lap.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.570
[Theo] You've been fucking buried in here.
Obsessed.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.655
Just move on, okay? She's dead!

00:30.739 --> 00:33.116
Get the fuck out now!

00:33.199 --> 00:35.452
Just remember. Look at your partner.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.329
[Joe] But I don't want Love.
I don't want any of this.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.999
All I want is you.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.168
-I killed Natalie for you!
-Shut up!

00:44.878 --> 00:46.212
Go.

00:50.383 --> 00:54.721
[Joe] Swinging was supposed to be
my marriage's dying gasp, not theirs.

00:54.804 --> 00:58.516
How the fuck are these two
getting out of here alive?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.158
You wanna give me a report?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.327
I'm good, I'm good. Thanks, babe.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.828
Okay, baby. Um...

01:19.370 --> 01:22.123
I'm gonna have to move us
to a purple flag.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.833
You're holding back.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.710
Recognized.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.465
I was in pain 'cause you got
some tape on my wound.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.759
I didn't want it
to sound like I was blaming you.

01:32.842 --> 01:37.055
Oh, my God. Baby, I appreciate
your concern for my feelings.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.224
I'm moving us back to a green flag.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.184
Stay in purple flag for a sec.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.185
Yeah?

01:42.769 --> 01:45.939
Try that bandage again
because it hurts like a motherfucker.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.733
Yes, yeah, just brace yourself.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.861
Breathe, sweetie. Take a deep breath in.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.614
[Joe] I have some fucking weirdos
in the basement.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.075
Yet, in their own weirdo way,

01:57.158 --> 02:00.078
the Conrads bring out
the best in each other.

02:00.161 --> 02:04.582
Now, Love and me,
we bring out something in each other.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.210
[moans]

02:07.293 --> 02:09.003
That's why I need to get out.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.006
In Love's mind,
we're finally on the same page

02:12.090 --> 02:16.886
and can face adversity as a united front,
which means Love's taken it upon herself

02:16.970 --> 02:19.514
to figure out how to, quote,
"get rid of the Conrads."

02:19.597 --> 02:24.310
And I am tasked with restoring our home
to a state of Rockwell perfection.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.813
Rockwell by way of Bettie Page, anyway.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.233
[Henry cooing]

02:30.316 --> 02:34.112
All while trying to keep
my son's attention on his cartoon.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.495
Don't worry.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.166
After today, we're never doing this again.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.973
[ominous music playing]

03:36.257 --> 03:39.219
[Joe] Unread still.
Where are you, Marienne?

03:39.302 --> 03:42.722
I need you to remind me
there's life beyond this.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.515
What's wrong?

03:46.351 --> 03:48.645
You throw your pacifier? Where is it?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.317
R.I.P. pacifier.

03:54.984 --> 03:59.447
And I have to figure out how to trash
Sherry and Cary's smorgasbord of sex toys.

03:59.530 --> 04:03.284
Make it like this disaster of a night
never happened.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.205
This stuff I should keep.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.498
Could prove useful.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.543
Unlike their lifetime supply
of double-headed dildos,

04:12.627 --> 04:14.420
those I've seen enough of.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.683
What the actual fuck?

04:26.766 --> 04:29.185
So last night could have gone worse?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.437
Fuck, this is a Chekhov situation now,
isn't it?

04:31.521 --> 04:34.357
If I touch it,
I all but guarantee it gets fired.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.067
Does that apply in real life?

04:36.150 --> 04:39.070
There's a literary trope
that pops up as often as Chekhov's gun,

04:39.153 --> 04:43.574
where you leave it
and then someone else uses it against you.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.701
Of the two...

04:45.702 --> 04:48.288
Chekhov was a logical man, he'd agree.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.376
At least Henry can't comprehend
what's happening.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.337
I'm trying to protect him, Marienne.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.673
The way no one bothered to protect us.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.508
[boys laughing]

05:06.848 --> 05:08.725
-[boy 1] Check this out.
-[boy 2] Ooh!

05:08.808 --> 05:11.811
[laughing, chattering]

05:16.232 --> 05:17.317
Nurse Fiona?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.819
Morning.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.195
Morning, Joseph.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.492
Are you okay?

05:27.577 --> 05:29.370
Go hang out with your friends.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.710
Who pissed in her Wheaties?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.422
That guy she's dating hurts her.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.467
What are you gonna do about it?
Gonna beat him up?

05:45.678 --> 05:49.182
Come on, man. Didn't you learn
from last time with your mom?

06:01.944 --> 06:03.154
[phone buzzing]

06:05.406 --> 06:07.658
-Dante, what's up?
-[Dante] Have you seen Marienne?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.243
I'm having trouble reaching her.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.703
She didn't come into work?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.539
I'm worried she got bad news
about the custody hearing.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.166
-Shit.
-I hope not.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.126
But, if so,

06:18.086 --> 06:19.754
I might know where she went.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.007
Tell me where. I can go.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.634
Okay, there's this store.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.303
When she was feeling really bad,
she used to sit outside

06:27.387 --> 06:29.180
and entertain going in.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.640
She hasn't done it in a while.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.225
-A liquor store?
-If she's there,

06:32.308 --> 06:34.727
she's not gonna wanna talk to you.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.356
[Joe] I should have been with you,
not in Love's latest mess.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.941
I shouldn't have left you alone.

06:40.024 --> 06:43.820
Hey, Dante, can you watch Henry
for just a little bit?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.321
Oh, my God. Yes.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.199
-Bring the little prince here.
-Thank you. I'll be there soon.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.455
Love thinks I'm getting rid of evidence.
Ought to buy me some time.

06:54.539 --> 06:58.126
I'm coming, Marienne.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.221
These look amazing.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.389
Thank you.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.978
What's up with him?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.814
Mm, stomach problems, stress.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.233
But honestly, I think these will help.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.192
Cary?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.410
Thank you, Love.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.829
You're both acting fucking weird.

07:34.912 --> 07:35.872
I mean...

07:37.790 --> 07:39.375
can you blame us?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.211
And what about you? You--

07:43.463 --> 07:44.797
Holding up all right?

07:47.008 --> 07:47.842
Me?

07:47.925 --> 07:48.759
Yeah.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.723
I'm sure you'd rather spend
every spare minute on your letter.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.642
For Henry's school counselor?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.686
Fuck, that was due today.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.522
I did say I'd help.
If you're comfortable with it.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.860
It's super vital to have her on your side
if you wanna get into Ashman.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.197
I'm not gonna let you write a letter
to help get my son into preschool.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.114
No!

08:10.198 --> 08:13.951
Love, see,
you're getting it wrong already.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.621
It's not the admission letter.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.998
It's a letter of introduction

08:19.081 --> 08:22.543
for the counselor who's gonna get
your son into preschool.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.003
Hey, truth?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.380
One mother to another.

08:27.215 --> 08:31.010
In no universe would I ever jeopardize
that baby's future.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.431
And trust me,
you only get one shot at Ashman.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.576
So Matthew has video of Joe and me?

08:55.660 --> 08:58.913
I always thought
your husband was an abusive dick but...

09:00.581 --> 09:02.792
now, thanks to my dad, there's proof.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.461
So this is what he's been doing?
Recording people?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.506
He's trying to figure out
who killed Natalie.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.715
Does he think it was me?

09:09.799 --> 09:12.134
What? No. No, of course not.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.428
I mean, I don't know. I don't know.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.223
Who knows what he thinks?
He's not on his A-game.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.642
He's not recording people.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.770
He's just-- He's accessing all the footage

09:22.853 --> 09:25.481
from all the cameras
everyone's already got.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.650
-What the fuck?
-Okay, okay, look.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.652
He kicked me out.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.279
Theo...

09:31.362 --> 09:33.698
I'm not going back to my fucking mom's.

09:33.781 --> 09:34.615
I just--

09:35.199 --> 09:38.202
I'm gonna go do my own thing.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.915
You know, go have a life, and, um...

09:45.793 --> 09:47.420
I want you to come with me.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.381
Run away with me, Love.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.217
I care about you, like so--

09:55.344 --> 09:56.721
I love you.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.181
I can't stand it.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.436
Just look me in the eye...

10:04.103 --> 10:07.398
and tell me
that your husband is not a violent man.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.236
Okay.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.155
This is what I'm gonna do.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.072
I'm gonna go,

10:15.156 --> 10:17.700
I'm gonna go back to my dad's
and get that footage.

10:17.783 --> 10:21.037
It's gonna be hard proof
that Joe is a piece of shit.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.955
I know that it's not admissible

10:23.039 --> 10:25.333
and I know it would get my dad
in a lot of trouble,

10:25.416 --> 10:27.627
but I am saying threaten Joe with it.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.255
You can use it to make a clean break.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.425
I know.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.926
I know, it's a lot.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.345
I need to think.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.805
I'm gonna take care of you.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.058
I promise.

10:43.142 --> 10:43.976
Okay?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.521
He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.939
I'll be back.

10:49.815 --> 10:50.775
Okay.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.411
Fuck you, Dad.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.674
[Joe] This is so far beneath you.

11:14.757 --> 11:19.011
I wanna erase everything that ever
made you think you deserve to be here.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.433
Um, what are you doing here?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.061
Oh, shit. My book club meets here.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.979
-What are you--?
-Dante.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.274
We were worried.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.905
-What happened?
-Please don't talk to me

11:37.988 --> 11:41.033
in that tone of voice like I'm about
to jump off a goddamn building.

11:44.078 --> 11:44.912
Have you?

11:47.289 --> 11:50.751
Sometimes I just like to sit
and count the creases in the paper bag.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.839
[Joe] You're embarrassed.
You don't want me to see you like this.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.105
Did the judge rule against you?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.400
Are you surprised?

12:15.776 --> 12:17.820
Ryan's taking her away from me.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.406
-You can fight it--
-They're moving to New Jersey.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.370
He's got a new job lined up,
a huge opportunity,

12:26.454 --> 12:27.830
cable news and...

12:28.664 --> 12:31.500
could it be any more perfect than that?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.294
[Joe] Son of a bitch.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.881
I was so stupid
to take this back to court.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.759
-I got greedy.
-You deserve everything you want.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.469
And more.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.513
Yeah.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.307
You can tell Dante I'm fine.

12:47.516 --> 12:48.726
Look.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.227
Fine.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.979
You can go.

12:53.981 --> 12:54.940
I get it.

13:00.070 --> 13:03.991
There are times I hate myself... too.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.578
So much I can barely stand it.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.794
I killed someone.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.549
When I was little.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.970
He was hurting my mom, so I shot him.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.432
That's how I ended up in a home.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.436
So you aren't the only person

13:33.521 --> 13:35.231
who's haunted by shame.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.484
Joe.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.779
Do you think now that I deserve
all the bad things that happened to me?

13:41.862 --> 13:43.489
No, of course not.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.909
-You were a kid.
-My mom felt differently.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.410
Yeah, well, fuck her.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.454
She was your mom. I would never--

13:50.538 --> 13:52.832
Exactly.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.501
You would never.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.920
That is the kind of mother you are.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.090
I struggle...

14:02.091 --> 14:05.219
every day with the fact that I'm capable
of doing something like that.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.263
I hate that I did it, but I did it.

14:07.346 --> 14:11.058
And I have to figure out
how I'm gonna live with it.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.731
And Henry makes it worth it.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.776
-Yes.
-Mm.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.697
-Yes, and I did not see that coming.
-Mm-hm.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.366
Yeah, neither did I.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.703
I just want her back.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.047
You're gonna figure that out.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.719
That's what people like us do.

14:55.477 --> 14:59.148
I don't need to cause any more damage.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.317
You can't.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.903
I'm serious. No matter
how broken my marriage is,

15:03.986 --> 15:05.988
it has nothing to do with you.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.489
It's done.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.451
I'm ending it.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.413
I would do anything for you.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.000
It's just, ask. Just ask me.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.050
What am I supposed to do now?

15:28.302 --> 15:29.678
What do you want?

15:38.938 --> 15:39.980
[Joe] This.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.357
This is real.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.526
I don't have to pretend with you.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.863
I'm the real me. This is our beginning.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.326
I'll find a way to fix everything,
so that this is our every day.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.870
[phone buzzing]

16:01.502 --> 16:02.670
[phone chimes]

16:06.632 --> 16:08.634
[vocalizing]

16:18.560 --> 16:20.938
Cary, you're off-key.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.399
You're not gonna get
the parasympathetic response.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.734
I'm not looking to reduce heart rate.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.320
I'm seeking a state of readiness.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.738
What?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.448
You're gonna break us out of here?

16:31.949 --> 16:34.284
I'm sensing a little bit of a tone.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.621
Well, I'm in a cage and you're planking.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.712
Do you have a plan?

16:45.963 --> 16:50.384
Yes, use everything
that's at our disposal.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.803
-My brute strength--
-Our relationships.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.513
Your friendship with Love?

16:54.596 --> 16:55.764
If you two were friends,

16:55.848 --> 16:59.059
why didn't she tell you about
the dungeon in her basement?

16:59.143 --> 17:00.144
[door opens]

17:01.311 --> 17:03.022
-Hi, Love.
-Hey.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.360
Okay, you could have asked.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.740
Since you're in my phone,

17:12.823 --> 17:16.368
I send my twins a check-in e-mail
every day that they're at camp.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.412
Yeah, sure. I'll send one.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.247
Thank you so much.

17:24.418 --> 17:29.798
So, um...
why did you wanna get into my phone?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.925
Just thought
I should make sure you check in

17:32.009 --> 17:33.594
with your adoring masses.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.514
You're gonna be off the grid
learning how to make placenta tea,

17:37.598 --> 17:39.516
so no posts for a while.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.727
God, you're so smart, Love.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.313
-Even under stress and--
-Stop trying to be my friend.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.732
We are friends.

17:47.399 --> 17:51.153
Were, are... I'm sorry.
I don't know how to talk to you

17:51.236 --> 17:53.947
-in this situation.
-Then why are you talking to me?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.866
Because my life is at stake.

17:57.159 --> 18:02.122
And, also, I happen to care about you
and apparently that didn't go away.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.834
Kind of always knew you had secrets.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.214
I just thought
I knew why you were so hush-hush.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.675
Because Madre Linda is a nest
full of narcissistic vipers?

18:14.259 --> 18:16.386
I mean, yeah, of course.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.139
'Cause narcissism is control.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.476
Do you know how terrifying it is
to not feel like you're in control?

18:23.477 --> 18:25.604
Especially with a kid.

18:25.687 --> 18:31.235
And... who isn't trying
to control us, Love?

18:31.819 --> 18:35.072
We're two women who are smarter
than everyone else

18:35.823 --> 18:37.491
and people can't stand that.

18:39.576 --> 18:45.916
I mean, my influencer bullshit means
I get to choose my flaws.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.128
What gets criticized, when they even see.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.172
It's how I protect myself and my family.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.508
Look where that got you.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.929
[laughing]

19:01.807 --> 19:02.766
Yeah.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.852
I guess one could argue,

19:04.935 --> 19:07.521
I was in a cage of my own making
the moment I had kids.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.067
No, got married.

19:13.944 --> 19:18.157
And at some point,
it all feels like the game is rigged.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.161
This was all and-- Hilariously inevitable.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.426
Theo tried to convince me
to run away with him.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.053
You're shitting me!

19:41.221 --> 19:43.432
He's totally in love with you,
and I knew it.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.558
[Sherry laughs]

19:45.767 --> 19:49.897
I mean, it's, like, super gross
but I think that's kind of hot.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.107
[both laughing]

19:52.191 --> 19:53.984
-Ew.
-Shh.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.409
He also told me that Matthew

20:03.243 --> 20:07.497
has been stealing surveillance footage,
hoping to find out who killed Natalie.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.001
He won't find anything.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.755
You should out him.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.299
-What?
-What do you mean?

20:17.382 --> 20:21.511
On my blog. Yeah, you should say
that we found out that Matthew

20:21.595 --> 20:23.764
has been watching us. He's a creep.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.432
Out him.

20:27.809 --> 20:28.894
Just my opinion.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.778
[Joe] I thought I knew what love was.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.239
Beck was a child.

20:40.322 --> 20:44.284
And Love? She fooled me into believing
she was someone she wasn't.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.829
The only thing I'm thankful for,
she brought our son into the world

20:47.913 --> 20:50.290
and led me to you.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.293
It's you, Marienne.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.588
[phone buzzing]

21:00.425 --> 21:02.135
Oh, no.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.440
[Love on voicemail]
Joe, Theo got information.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.192
Just call me back as soon as you get this.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.153
[Joe] I left her to her own devices
for too long.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.906
God knows what she--
The Conrads are probably dead.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.701
Maybe she burned their house down,
then bashed Matthew over the head.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.619
Goddamn it, Love.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.038
Who's that, Joe?

21:40.716 --> 21:41.591
Joe...

21:45.679 --> 21:46.638
Thank you.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.892
You were right.
I can't just give up on Juliette again.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.396
I can't let her feel
that her mother could ever abandon her.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.024
So I'm leaving Madre Linda.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.735
You're leaving?

22:00.319 --> 22:03.196
Follow them to New Jersey,
even if it means sleeping in my car,

22:03.280 --> 22:05.407
flipping burgers, whatever it takes.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.992
[Joe] I'm going to lose you.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.626
I don't regret this.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.588
[Joe] Good, good.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.674
But how can I stop this
from being the end for us?

22:27.763 --> 22:28.847
Go home, Joe.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.727
Can I at least get my clothes back?

22:35.562 --> 22:37.064
I guess that seems fair.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.945
[Joe] This wasn't the plan,
but I can't blame you.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.656
You're trying to solve
an impossible problem,

22:46.740 --> 22:49.743
and that problem is Ryan.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.621
[Travis] Why don't you just sleep
in your office? I don't care.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.747
[Fiona] Travis!

23:09.679 --> 23:10.847
What did you do?

23:26.613 --> 23:29.157
[Joe] Chekhov, you fucker. I can't, right?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.326
That's the guy Love wants me to be.

23:31.410 --> 23:36.164
Then again, people like us,
we figure it out.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.458
Ryan has to die.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.386
[Joe] Is that our doorbell cam?

23:49.469 --> 23:52.514
Yeah, ripped it out. Where's Henry?

23:52.597 --> 23:56.977
He's with Dante. I wasn't clear
on when our guests are checking out.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.812
Yeah, I've been preoccupied.

23:58.895 --> 24:03.608
So, turns out,
our friendly neighbor has been hacking

24:03.692 --> 24:05.944
into everyone's security cameras
for months.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.571
-[Joe] Shit.
-Yeah.

24:07.654 --> 24:10.407
He thinks
his wife's killer is still out there.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.491
Oh, does he?

24:11.575 --> 24:17.956
Yeah, but thank God
for Sherry Conrad who found out

24:18.039 --> 24:21.543
and took it upon herself
to blog about it a half hour ago.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.005
[Joe]
It must be said, Love's good at all this.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.590
Say more, please.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.802
It seems like she found out
what he was doing,

24:31.428 --> 24:35.724
so she and Cary fled
to some undisclosed location.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.143
Whole town's in an uproar.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.603
[Joe] Scary good.

24:39.686 --> 24:43.648
Which explains a whole slew of suits
that just descended on the Engler house.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.110
My best guess, it's a bunch
of lawyers scrambling to cover up

24:47.194 --> 24:49.446
all the insanely illegal shit
he's been doing.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.489
Wow.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.532
You really have been busy.

24:55.118 --> 24:59.873
Yeah. Well, as were you, it seems.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.043
[Joe] Shit. The other shoe drops.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.712
The house looks amazing.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.924
Good as new, right?

25:10.634 --> 25:12.552
Quite the team, aren't we?

25:12.636 --> 25:14.554
[Joe] In the worst way.

25:20.894 --> 25:21.728
Fuck.

25:23.730 --> 25:27.484
-What--? What is this?
-[Joe] Anton cackling in his grave.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.111
I found that in Cary's stuff.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.446
-Cary?
-Yeah.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.157
That psycho brought a gun into our house?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.494
These people are more fucked up
than I thought.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.663
Um, okay.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.168
Perfect. We could make it look
like a murder-suicide.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.128
Worked for us before.

25:50.590 --> 25:53.677
[Joe] Listen to her. Our marriage
cannot end soon enough.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.220
Great minds...

25:57.889 --> 25:58.932
[Matthew] Okay.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.685
You want me to wipe it? I hear you.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.062
You're not hearing me
because I'm not saying that.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.605
We need to be clear.

26:05.689 --> 26:10.485
You're erasing everything you've gathered
of your own volition and entirely alone.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.529
[Matthew]
And throwing the whole thing away

26:12.612 --> 26:15.782
because, damn it,
I just felt like an upgrade. Got it.

26:19.786 --> 26:24.958
Hey, I'm sorry,
I was just coming to look for my charger.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.646
If I could just get
a little more time here, please.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.070
Show me the thing that's haunting you.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.781
If there's more,
I will do everything I can to help.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.408
I don't trust my neighbors.

26:58.491 --> 27:01.119
-Joe seems okay, but the wife, Love.
-The Quinn, of course.

27:01.202 --> 27:05.165
Yes, Love saw Natalie
the day she disappeared, and she is off.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.875
Okay. Okay, let's see it.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.797
Nat arrives, then she goes in...

27:18.345 --> 27:20.930
Then drives away. What am I missing?

27:21.014 --> 27:23.391
She stayed in there for a while,
then she comes out.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.018
There's a second missing,

27:25.101 --> 27:28.229
and she's wearing
that coat and hat, and...

27:29.356 --> 27:31.358
Keep going.
Do you think that's not Natalie?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.151
I know how it sounds.

27:33.234 --> 27:36.237
Okay, it's not her.
It's the Quinn who killed her,

27:36.321 --> 27:40.158
broke her ring to destroy the bio-data,
staged it at a rest stop,

27:40.241 --> 27:43.036
dropped off her car,
and killed Gil Brigham too,

27:43.119 --> 27:44.245
of all people.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.414
Made it look like a suicide
to frame him for murder.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.583
-I am trying--
-I know what it sounds like.

27:49.209 --> 27:54.798
Or Natalie was a beautiful,
flawed person with secrets.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.384
Part of her wasn't
who you thought she was.

27:57.467 --> 28:01.638
I don't fucking believe that, okay?
I can't fucking believe that.

28:02.847 --> 28:07.310
I just keep thinking.
If I look harder, I'm gonna see it.

28:07.394 --> 28:11.189
Okay, you have combed
through this thoroughly. Am I wrong?

28:11.272 --> 28:14.109
You have to decide if you're gonna
let this hunch destroy you,

28:14.192 --> 28:16.277
your company, this family.

28:16.903 --> 28:20.031
These people are coming for you.
It needs to be gone.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.153
You did the right thing.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.758
So... I haven't seen Joe much.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.260
Can you...?

29:23.386 --> 29:24.512
I'll get him a new one.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.055
Yeah.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.559
God. You know, it doesn't seem fair.

29:30.518 --> 29:34.189
This all. I mean, Joe's the reason
we're all in this position

29:34.272 --> 29:35.523
in the first place.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.028
You didn't do what you did to Natalie

29:40.111 --> 29:42.739
because the Englers were stealing
your Wi-Fi.

29:48.953 --> 29:52.290
You were trying to tell me
how disconnected you felt.

29:53.833 --> 29:54.709
Of course.

29:55.502 --> 29:59.506
Your husband's
screwing someone else while you're what,

29:59.589 --> 30:00.965
changing diapers?

30:01.049 --> 30:03.676
Sherry, shut the fuck up.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.846
Where is he now?

30:07.388 --> 30:12.185
Fuck him. Letting you fix a marriage that
never stood a chance in the first place.

30:22.445 --> 30:23.363
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:23.863 --> 30:25.573
-Easy, hon!
-Is that my nine?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.200
Just sit and be quiet.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.330
New rules. One of you takes this,
shoots the other.

30:33.748 --> 30:36.167
I let whoever lives out.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.546
-Are you insane?
-Wait, what?

30:39.629 --> 30:45.260
Well, if your marriage is so perfect,
stay together, die together.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.056
[door opens]

30:51.266 --> 30:52.767
[door closes, then locks]

30:53.768 --> 30:55.520
[dramatic music playing]

31:26.259 --> 31:29.470
[Joe] This is the part of myself
I told you I struggle against.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.891
It took bros in the woods to teach me
it's not something I need to reject.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.101
It can be embraced for the right reasons.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.479
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

31:38.563 --> 31:42.150
[Joe] He looks like a man riding high
on a string of recent victories.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.860
Big new job, full custody of his kid.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.988
Thanks to Cary Conrad's
black-market elephant tranquilizer,

31:47.071 --> 31:51.326
Ryan's tox report will tell the story,
a guy trying to outrun the demons.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.578
Sadly, the demons won.

32:00.209 --> 32:03.463
I know from my recon
that Ryan is the kind of nutjob

32:03.546 --> 32:06.215
who thinks taking the stairs
will add years to his life.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.176
Well, the irony.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.346
Wait, where's he going?

32:13.097 --> 32:14.432
[elevator bell dings]

32:17.352 --> 32:20.438
The elevator, you lazy piece of shit.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.424
You following me, asshole? Huh?

32:49.133 --> 32:49.968
[Joe] Fuck.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.849
You gotta be kidding me.
My ex put you up to this, Library Joe?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.977
-No, that was me.
-No? All right.

32:59.936 --> 33:03.022
-Speak up. I can't hear you.
-I just want to talk.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.441
Talk, really? Talk.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.318
With this?

33:08.444 --> 33:10.947
[Joe] New trope:
wishing you had Chekhov's gun to fire.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.241
I think I'll call the cops.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.244
Great. I'll tell them
about the drugs in your car.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.713
You tell that bitch,
she's lucky I didn't kill you.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.214
You got it?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.148
[thuds]

33:45.231 --> 33:47.150
[Joe] Simple overdose is out,

33:47.233 --> 33:50.069
but he was wasted,
stepped too close to the edge,

33:50.153 --> 33:51.571
even took a tragic leap.

33:51.654 --> 33:55.324
It all works, so long as this bastard's--

33:56.826 --> 33:57.952
Alive?

33:58.036 --> 33:58.870
[groans]

34:00.955 --> 34:02.415
[grunting]

34:05.126 --> 34:08.588
One person cuts out before Shavasana,
I'm doing 20-to-life.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.721
You don't have it in you.

34:19.015 --> 34:20.433
[dramatic music playing]

34:28.483 --> 34:29.400
[Ryan gasps]

34:30.193 --> 34:31.486
That's for her.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.200
Robbery-homicide may have to do.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.006
[woman] Oh, my God. Help!

34:52.090 --> 34:55.927
-[Joe] Always stay through Shavasana.
-[woman] Help! Somebody call 911!

35:37.051 --> 35:39.804
What are you doing back there?

35:57.113 --> 36:00.533
What the fuck?

36:10.459 --> 36:13.421
Holy shit.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.058
[Love on voicemail] Hey.
You've reached Love Quinn-Goldberg.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.811
Please leave me a message
and I'll get back to you soon as I can.

36:28.895 --> 36:32.523
Love, hi, it's me. Where are you?
We need to talk right now.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.819
There's no saying this is bulletproof.

36:36.903 --> 36:43.910
Do you really think she would have
given us a gun if it wasn't?

36:43.993 --> 36:47.246
God, will you just finish already? Oh!

36:47.330 --> 36:49.916
Babe, I am trying.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.754
I don't know how you're so regular
without any soluble fiber.

36:55.588 --> 37:00.092
You know what, Sher,
it's like you think we're on a train.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.555
We'll reach our stop,
the door will magically open.

37:04.639 --> 37:08.100
Right. 'Cause I'm not crawling
up the walls like a moron.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.518
Oh, yeah.

37:09.602 --> 37:14.565
'Cause your plan, unlike my shit,
is proving to be real fucking solid.

37:18.986 --> 37:19.820
Hello?

37:23.032 --> 37:23.866
Love?

37:25.076 --> 37:25.952
You here?

37:32.458 --> 37:33.292
Love?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.183
Love?

38:02.321 --> 38:03.281
You know,

38:04.490 --> 38:07.660
we need to start thinking about the kids.

38:09.870 --> 38:12.623
We really need to consider their future.

38:15.835 --> 38:19.714
That's not just an argument
for me to be the one to get out.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.215
Wait...

38:22.258 --> 38:26.512
Why would thinking about what's best
for the kids be an argument for you?

38:27.805 --> 38:31.058
Name Cole's geo tutor.

38:34.562 --> 38:35.604
Monica.

38:36.897 --> 38:39.233
Monica's math.

38:39.900 --> 38:44.363
Who the fuck has
a geo tutor, Cary? No one!

38:44.447 --> 38:45.364
You know what?

38:45.448 --> 38:49.285
We're not gonna fucking debate
which parent gets to live!

38:52.913 --> 38:53.914
Fuck this.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.542
-What are you doing?
-Stand back!

39:11.682 --> 39:15.436
Man, guy told me this would go
through an engine block.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.150
[sobbing] You shot...

39:23.361 --> 39:24.987
my ear.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.364
Oh, my God.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.325
Shit, shit. Let me--

39:30.117 --> 39:32.244
-Just let me see.
-Stay away from me.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.288
-I know head trauma.
-Stop.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.916
[yelling] Get
the hell away from me, honey!

39:36.999 --> 39:37.833
Hey!

39:39.835 --> 39:40.669
Hey.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.184
[Sherry] They're murderers, Theo!

39:55.267 --> 39:58.521
We think they killed Gil too.
They blamed it all on him.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.648
Wait. Where's Love?

40:00.731 --> 40:03.651
-What do you mean, "Where's Love?"
-Theo, she's half of it!

40:03.734 --> 40:04.985
Don't be an idiot!

40:05.069 --> 40:08.656
She caught her husband cheating
with your stepmom and she murdered her.

40:08.739 --> 40:12.660
Now she's delivering a letter to
a preschool counselor half an hour away.

40:12.743 --> 40:15.287
Like she doesn't have two people
locked in her basement.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.997
She'll be back any minute.

40:17.081 --> 40:21.168
I am not exactly in a position
to lie to you right now, am I?

40:21.252 --> 40:24.130
-Get us out of here, Theo.
-No. You don't know her situation.

40:24.213 --> 40:27.174
-Joe is the one that killed Natalie.
-Joe didn't fucking kill her!

40:27.258 --> 40:30.219
Let us out! Now! Find the key!

40:30.302 --> 40:31.804
Let us out!

40:32.888 --> 40:35.182
[Joe] You'll never believe that he's dead.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.560
Not just because people like Ryan
never seem to die

40:37.643 --> 40:43.190
but because he taught you that you don't
deserve a second chance, but you do.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.276
We both do.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.660
I don't feel bad about this.

40:55.202 --> 40:59.540
It isn't like what Love does.
She is crazy, impulsive.

41:00.249 --> 41:02.793
But real evil has to be dealt with

41:02.877 --> 41:07.006
and you don't do that by letting it live
to take good people down.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.645
Hey, it's Fiona.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.773
Something happened.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.219
[phone buzzes]

41:57.681 --> 42:00.559
[Dante on voice recording]
Hey. Wondering if I should put Henry down.

42:00.643 --> 42:03.896
I'm not sure when Joe's coming.
Let me know. No presh.

42:03.979 --> 42:04.813
What?

42:07.316 --> 42:08.567
[clearing throat]

42:09.193 --> 42:14.240
Hey, Dante.
Yeah, thank you so much for taking him.

42:14.907 --> 42:19.286
Let me double-check with Joe. If I can't
reach him, I'll call you in a sec.

42:20.120 --> 42:20.996
Thank you.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.290
[voice recording sends]

42:32.424 --> 42:33.592
[door opens]

42:35.427 --> 42:37.888
Oh, fuck. You scared me.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.725
What are you doing?

42:44.603 --> 42:46.063
Uh, nothing, nothing.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.359
Um...

42:50.442 --> 42:51.569
Is that a key?

42:59.994 --> 43:01.704
I know that it's not true.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.583
What the Conrads said that you did.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.094
What did the Conrads say I did?

43:17.177 --> 43:18.804
That you killed Natalie.

43:21.765 --> 43:27.104
I found footage from the day
that she disappeared.

43:28.731 --> 43:29.773
It was Joe.

43:32.818 --> 43:36.739
I know what he is.
You don't have to protect him anymore.

43:40.075 --> 43:41.285
I need you to leave.

43:43.037 --> 43:46.457
I need you to leave Madre Linda
and never come back.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.666
Come with me, then.

43:51.795 --> 43:52.838
I can't.

43:54.923 --> 43:56.300
It's my family.

44:05.934 --> 44:06.977
We can never...

44:09.271 --> 44:10.397
see each other...

44:12.483 --> 44:13.484
ever again.

44:19.698 --> 44:21.158
You have to promise me.

44:24.495 --> 44:28.499
Theo, I need you to promise me.

44:31.585 --> 44:32.461
Okay.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.215
I promise.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.511
Whatever you want.

44:43.847 --> 44:44.807
Okay.

44:46.016 --> 44:49.144
Okay, you need to go. Now.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.191
I need you to give me the key back.

44:57.486 --> 44:58.487
Um...

45:00.948 --> 45:04.159
-What about...? What are you...?
-No. Don't worry.

45:04.952 --> 45:08.122
I'm gonna let them out,
the second you leave.

45:11.458 --> 45:12.459
Of course.

45:15.838 --> 45:16.797
Okay.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.175
I'm gonna go.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.014
Goodbye, Love.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.397
Theo, wait.

45:42.614 --> 45:43.532
[gasping]

45:57.838 --> 45:59.423
