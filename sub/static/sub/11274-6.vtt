Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.971 --> 00:08.224
Boy, did I have a
crazy dream last night.

00:08.224 --> 00:09.175
What was it?

00:09.175 --> 00:11.644
I was at this party with
a bunch of strangers.

00:11.644 --> 00:14.147
The food was great. The music was loud.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.648
All of a sudden,

00:15.648 --> 00:17.650
everybody in the place
stopped and was lookin' at me,

00:17.650 --> 00:19.652
and I realized that I
wasn't wearing any pants.

00:19.652 --> 00:20.653
Oh, yes, yes.

00:20.653 --> 00:23.156
I've had that dream a million times.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.859
Yeah, me, too, and boy, is
it ever embarrassing, huh?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.277
Why is that?

00:31.414 --> 00:33.783
Uh... uh, Norm?

00:33.783 --> 00:35.285
Never embarrassed me.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.202
Tell you the one I hate.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.204
You know, you're back in college, right?

00:38.204 --> 00:40.206
And you haven't been to
class the entire semester,

00:40.206 --> 00:42.208
and the teacher's about
to give the final exam.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.710
Oh, yeah, that one's the worst.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.211
What're you talkin' about, Carla?

00:45.211 --> 00:46.379
You never went to college.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.631
It's a dream, stupid.

00:50.300 --> 00:54.354
Well, how about the one where
you go to this fancy restaurant,

00:54.354 --> 00:55.355
and before they let you in,

00:55.355 --> 00:56.856
they make you leave
your legs at the door?

00:59.359 --> 01:02.362
Then the girl gives you
claim check number six.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.730
So you go in,

01:03.730 --> 01:05.065
but instead of food,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.067
everyone's eatin' their silverware.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.568
Only you can't really enjoy your fork

01:08.568 --> 01:10.070
because you're so worried

01:10.070 --> 01:12.572
that whoever got claim check
number nine might finish first

01:12.572 --> 01:14.958
and pick up your legs by mistake.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.130
Yeah, oh, yeah.

01:22.132 --> 01:26.086
(piano plays)

01:26.086 --> 01:28.505
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:28.505 --> 01:31.508
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:31.508 --> 01:34.010
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:34.010 --> 01:37.013
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:37.013 --> 01:42.519
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:42.519 --> 01:45.438
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:45.438 --> 01:50.944
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:50.944 --> 01:55.448
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.951
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.453
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:00.453 --> 02:05.959
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.461
? You want to go where people know ?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.964
? People are all the same ?

02:10.964 --> 02:15.468
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

Two vodka martinis and a Wallbanger.

02:37.106 --> 02:39.108
Wallbanger!

02:39.609 --> 02:42.111
Sam, I need to ask a big favor.

02:42.111 --> 02:45.114
All right, as long as
it doesn't interfere

02:45.114 --> 02:46.616
with your job.

02:46.616 --> 02:50.370
Okay, then, I need to ask a huge favor.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.704
Would it be possible

02:51.704 --> 02:53.206
two weeks from this coming Wednesday

02:53.206 --> 02:57.210
for me to leave work
early about ten minutes?

02:57.210 --> 02:59.212
Sure, why not?

02:59.212 --> 03:01.214
Oh, thank you, Sam.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.583
Thank you very much.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.885
And thank you for not prying further

03:05.885 --> 03:07.887
into the matter.

03:07.887 --> 03:12.392
Especially since, well,
I've no valid excuse

03:12.392 --> 03:14.894
for my early departure.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.764
Sam, I must be frank.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.149
Sounds good.

03:20.149 --> 03:21.651
I'll be Bob.

03:23.653 --> 03:26.155
I mean, it's not as if I had

03:26.155 --> 03:27.156
a dental appointment

03:27.156 --> 03:30.159
or had to pick up some
relative at the airport.

03:30.159 --> 03:31.160
Okay, Diane,

03:31.160 --> 03:33.162
why do you have to leave early

03:33.162 --> 03:35.031
two weeks from this Wednesday?

03:35.031 --> 03:36.783
Well, if you must know...

03:38.167 --> 03:40.036
I have a date.

03:40.036 --> 03:42.255
Oh, yeah, I've heard of those.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.590
Have fun.

03:44.591 --> 03:50.096
Oh, sweet transparent bravado.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.048
Could there be a soul dearer

03:52.548 --> 03:54.050
than the little boy lost,

03:54.050 --> 03:56.552
trembling on the edge of despair,

03:56.552 --> 04:00.890
yet struggling manfully to
maintain his stiff upper lip?

04:02.058 --> 04:04.527
Thank you for noticing.

04:04.527 --> 04:06.029
Oh, wait, Sam, wait. One more thing.

04:06.029 --> 04:07.030
What?

04:07.530 --> 04:10.033
After our five-star-dinner-
and-season-premiere-

04:10.033 --> 04:11.034
of-the-ballet
date,

04:11.034 --> 04:16.539
Chad-- Dr. Stark,
may desire a kiss.

04:16.539 --> 04:19.041
Would you mind--
should he ask--

04:19.041 --> 04:22.045
if I let his lips touch mine?

04:22.045 --> 04:24.547
Touch your what?

04:26.049 --> 04:27.550
Oh, Mr. Peterson, I forgot.

04:27.550 --> 04:29.052
Some guy dropped by earlier

04:29.052 --> 04:31.054
and asked me to give this to you.

04:31.054 --> 04:32.055
Oh, thank you, Woody.

04:32.055 --> 04:34.507
And thank you, God!

04:34.507 --> 04:36.509
Oh, well, what's that, Normie?

04:36.509 --> 04:39.262
A research grant from the
National Beer Foundation?

04:39.262 --> 04:42.065
No, Cliffie, just a measly
little pair of sky-view seats

04:42.065 --> 04:44.567
for the Sox-Yankee
doubleheader tomorrow.

04:44.567 --> 04:45.568
Whoa, you're kidding me!

04:46.069 --> 04:47.570
I pulled every string I had

04:47.570 --> 04:49.572
and I could only score standing room.

04:49.572 --> 04:50.573
Come on. How'd you get that?

04:50.573 --> 04:51.574
Sammy, it's not who you know,

04:52.075 --> 04:53.076
it's who I know, all right?

04:53.076 --> 04:54.077
Yeah.

04:54.077 --> 04:56.579
A client friend of mine, Jerry Donahue,

04:56.579 --> 04:58.081
sent those babies over to thank me

04:58.081 --> 05:00.450
for being such a fantastic
financial counselor.

05:00.450 --> 05:01.951
No, seriously, how'd you get 'em?

05:01.951 --> 05:03.870
I'm tellin' you,

05:03.870 --> 05:06.122
I saved the guy a bundle
on his taxes last year.

05:06.122 --> 05:08.341
He asked me to invest
his windfall, you know?

05:08.341 --> 05:10.093
And in the space of six short months,

05:10.093 --> 05:12.095
I kinda doubled his money.

05:12.095 --> 05:14.597
We got lucky on a little
convenience mart in Worcester.

05:14.597 --> 05:16.599
What'd you do? Hold it up?

05:16.599 --> 05:17.600
(laughs)

05:17.600 --> 05:18.601
You guys are hilarious.

05:18.601 --> 05:19.602
But Jerry's laughing

05:19.602 --> 05:21.104
all the way to the bank, all right?

05:21.104 --> 05:22.472
I diversified the guy.

05:22.472 --> 05:24.307
We went into, uh, mutuals,

05:24.307 --> 05:26.309
and a very pretty little biotech company

05:26.309 --> 05:27.310
that just went public.

05:27.310 --> 05:30.313
Boy, sounds like you got
the Midas touch there.

05:30.313 --> 05:31.314
You should hear some
of the other great ideas

05:31.314 --> 05:32.315
we have cooked up.

05:32.315 --> 05:33.733
Yeah? Like what?

05:35.735 --> 05:37.737
Mm... no, no, sorry, guys.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.238
My lips are sealed.

05:39.238 --> 05:40.740
Buy you a beer.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.741
It's called "Tan 'N Wash".

05:43.242 --> 05:44.744
Tan and wash, guys.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.746
The ultimate marriage of
luxury and convenience.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.749
A combination tanning salon
and coin-operated laundry.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.668
Get real.

05:52.668 --> 05:53.669
Come on.

05:53.669 --> 05:56.172
The timing's right on this.

05:56.172 --> 05:57.173
Summer tans are fading.

05:57.173 --> 05:58.174
Winter's coming.

05:58.174 --> 05:59.675
It's always dirty clothes season.

05:59.675 --> 06:01.677
It's gonna be the hottest place in town.

06:01.677 --> 06:03.563
I'm glad you're already
thinking about arson.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.981
(laughs): Yeah, arson.

06:04.981 --> 06:06.849
Don't listen to them, Norman.

06:06.849 --> 06:09.852
And never be deterred
by the mindless jibes

06:09.852 --> 06:11.020
of the ignorant masses.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.905
Those ignorant masses are
gonna be our customers.

06:12.905 --> 06:17.276
Hey, I'll be there will bells on.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.612
Everyone'll be there, buddy,

06:19.612 --> 06:21.114
fluffing, folding, relaxing happily

06:21.114 --> 06:23.116
beneath the healthful rays

06:23.116 --> 06:26.619
of a federally approved
UVA bronzing unit.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.121
Well, Normie,

06:28.121 --> 06:30.123
I gotta say it's the silliest,
most harebrained scheme

06:30.123 --> 06:31.624
I've ever heard of.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.126
Yeah.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.128
Well, I gotta go.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.630
(quietly): Normie, walk me out.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.634
I'm not leaving yet, Cliff.

06:41.634 --> 06:42.635
Neither am I.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.637
Ma and I want in.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.640
In where?

06:47.640 --> 06:49.142
Don't be naive, Normie.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.027
Put me up for five shares.

06:51.027 --> 06:54.363
No, no, no.

06:54.363 --> 06:56.365
Investments are risky, Cliff.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.367
Look, I never do business
with friends, all right?

06:58.367 --> 07:01.237
Besides, it's 200 bucks a share.

07:01.237 --> 07:02.872
Put me down for five, too, will ya?

07:02.872 --> 07:06.209
Oh, great, Norm, now
the cat's outta the bag!

07:06.209 --> 07:08.077
CARLA: I think you're all crazy.

07:08.077 --> 07:10.379
But if Clavin makes
big bucks and I don't,

07:10.379 --> 07:12.381
I won't be able to live with the shame.

07:12.381 --> 07:13.749
Give me a share.

07:13.749 --> 07:15.551
Oh, me, too! Me, too!

07:15.551 --> 07:16.419
You, Diane?

07:16.419 --> 07:18.221
Laying bets on a laundry?

07:18.221 --> 07:19.722
Well, in my case, it's not a gamble,

07:19.722 --> 07:21.724
but rather a show of faith

07:21.724 --> 07:23.726
in our great free enterprise system.

07:23.726 --> 07:26.729
Yes, even Diane Chambers is not immune

07:26.729 --> 07:28.681
to the renaissance
of American patriotism

07:28.681 --> 07:29.682
in the 1980s.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.684
Although I hasten to remind you

07:31.684 --> 07:34.187
this does not imply any
shifting of my support

07:34.187 --> 07:35.688
toward the current administration.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.107
I hope nobody was looking
for a silent partner.

07:40.109 --> 07:41.994
CARLA: You know, Diane,

07:41.994 --> 07:44.914
you shouldn't be investin'
in a tanning salon.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.415
You oughta be usin' one.

07:46.415 --> 07:48.784
You got skin the color of Elmer's glue.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.121
I happen to have

07:52.121 --> 07:58.127
what Restoration poets
refer to as "alabaster skin."

07:58.127 --> 08:01.130
Well, at least your hair looks nice.

08:03.132 --> 08:06.135
Besides, with my rendezvous
with Chad coming up,

08:06.135 --> 08:08.137
I dare not risk freckling.

08:08.137 --> 08:09.138
Why not? If it got boring,

08:09.639 --> 08:11.641
you could always
play connect-the-dots.

08:11.641 --> 08:15.027
God, how this must torment you.

08:16.946 --> 08:18.447
No, no, no, come on, Norm.

08:18.447 --> 08:19.949
You gonna let us in or not?

08:19.949 --> 08:21.450
Let's just change the
subject, all right?

08:21.450 --> 08:23.736
Hey, he's tryin' to sidetrack us.

08:23.736 --> 08:26.038
This thing must be a gold mine.

08:26.038 --> 08:29.041
Yeah, yeah, hey, Normie,
uh, correct me if I'm wrong,

08:29.041 --> 08:30.543
but yesterday you had a letter

08:30.543 --> 08:31.544
you needed mailed.

08:31.544 --> 08:35.464
I did it, and you can at
least return the favor.

08:35.464 --> 08:36.966
Cliffie, that's your job.

08:36.966 --> 08:37.967
Well, all right.

08:37.967 --> 08:39.969
Then, as one
professional to another--

08:39.969 --> 08:41.220
come on, Norm!

08:41.220 --> 08:42.755
(all pleading)

08:42.755 --> 08:43.556
I know what's gonna happen!

08:43.556 --> 08:45.057
I know what's gonna happen.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.926
Somethin's gonna go wrong
and you're all gonna blame me.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.344
(all protesting)

08:48.344 --> 08:50.346
All right, well, well.

08:50.846 --> 08:52.098
All right, yes! Whoo! Whoo!

08:52.098 --> 08:53.432
Hey, Wood, do you want in?

08:53.432 --> 08:55.818
I don't think so.

08:55.818 --> 08:57.570
You know, when I left home,

08:57.570 --> 08:59.855
my father gave me
some very sound advice.

08:59.855 --> 09:03.359
"Never trust a man who
can't look ya in the eye.

09:03.359 --> 09:05.361
"Never talk when you can listen.

09:05.361 --> 09:08.864
"And never spend venture
capital on a limited partnership

09:08.864 --> 09:11.867
without a detailed, analytical
fiduciary prospectus."

09:20.676 --> 09:22.428
Afternoon, everybody.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.263
ALL: Norm!

09:24.263 --> 09:25.765
Hey, Norm, how's the
world been treatin' ya?

09:25.765 --> 09:28.768
Like a baby treats a diaper.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.275
So...

09:36.275 --> 09:39.145
what's the deal with
the, uh, "Tan 'N Wash"?

09:39.145 --> 09:41.030
For a new business, I'd say Tan 'N Wash

09:41.030 --> 09:43.032
is doing as well as could be expected.

09:43.032 --> 09:44.033
Oh, yeah?

09:44.033 --> 09:45.534
I dropped by this morning

09:45.534 --> 09:47.536
and the only customer in the place

09:47.536 --> 09:49.538
was a lonely woman kicking the hell

09:49.538 --> 09:50.906
out of a jammed change machine.

09:50.906 --> 09:52.158
Oh, come on. By the way,

09:52.158 --> 09:55.544
you owe me a quarter
and a new pair of shoes.

09:55.544 --> 09:58.381
Patience, Carla, all right? Patience.

09:58.381 --> 10:00.383
There are gray skies on the horizon.

10:00.383 --> 10:02.385
Yeah, it's gonna get cold
and damp and miserable.

10:02.885 --> 10:03.886
We'll be wading in customers.

10:03.886 --> 10:06.389
Yeah, I think we're wading
in something right now.

10:06.389 --> 10:08.257
I've worked out a great
new promotional campaign.

10:08.257 --> 10:09.759
Promotional campaign? Yeah.

10:09.759 --> 10:14.146
Whew! Hey, hey!

10:14.146 --> 10:16.065
Check out Mr. Tan there, huh?

10:16.565 --> 10:18.067
Say, Sammy,

10:18.067 --> 10:20.436
did you just fly to the
tropics and spend a week

10:20.436 --> 10:23.439
and thousands of dollars under
the blazing, unhealthy sun?

10:23.439 --> 10:24.440
(dismissive laugh)

10:24.440 --> 10:27.443
No, no, Norm. No, I
just spent my lunch hour

10:27.443 --> 10:30.446
under some healthful,
federally approved UVA rays

10:30.446 --> 10:31.831
at the Tan 'N Wash.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.250
Say, those clothes are really
lookin' clean there, pal.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.751
Well, thank you, Norm.

10:35.751 --> 10:38.754
Yeah. Now is it true
that with these coupons

10:38.754 --> 10:41.257
anyone can get 25% off on
their first five visits?

10:41.257 --> 10:42.258
Well, that's what I hear.

10:42.258 --> 10:43.259
Great.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.013
Well!

10:47.013 --> 10:48.297
Hey... I tell ya,

10:50.299 --> 10:52.685
is that Cliff Clavin
or is that Don Ho, huh?

10:52.685 --> 10:54.637
Uh...

10:54.637 --> 10:55.638
Where ya been, buddy,

10:55.638 --> 10:57.139
some, uh, faraway island resort?

10:57.139 --> 10:59.141
Oh, easy mistake, Norm,

10:59.141 --> 11:01.644
but, no, I got this tan
right here in Beantown.

11:01.644 --> 11:03.646
Is that at the new Tan 'N Wash

11:03.646 --> 11:04.647
I've been hearing so danged much about?

11:04.647 --> 11:06.148
That's right, Normie.

11:06.148 --> 11:07.650
And, by the way, did you realize

11:07.650 --> 11:09.151
that the tan first gained popularity

11:09.151 --> 11:11.037
in what is now known as the Bronze Age?

11:11.037 --> 11:12.988
Great, great. Well, I'm sold.

11:13.489 --> 11:15.991
Oh, and, by the way, look
how white I used to be.

11:18.878 --> 11:22.798
You wore your socks
in the tanning booth?

11:22.798 --> 11:25.301
Well, I, I gotta be careful, Sammy.

11:25.301 --> 11:28.304
The Clavin men have, uh,
feet like a baby's bottom.

11:28.304 --> 11:31.924
With faces to match.

11:31.924 --> 11:32.725
Will you back off, Carla?

11:32.725 --> 11:34.727
I don't see you pitchin'
in for the cause here.

11:34.727 --> 11:35.594
Yeah, yeah?

11:35.594 --> 11:36.562
Well, all I know

11:37.063 --> 11:39.565
is I wouldn't stick a fork in a toaster,

11:39.565 --> 11:41.067
never mind my valuables.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.069
Come on, guys.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.438
Uh, whatta you say we
snap up these flyers?

11:45.438 --> 11:46.939
They can't last forever.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.442
Wouldn't be so sure, Norm.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.443
You know, Peterson,

11:50.443 --> 11:52.862
you've got the guts of a burglar.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.363
In here peddling a tanning salon

11:54.363 --> 11:55.865
on the sunniest day of the year.

11:55.865 --> 11:57.249
Outside of someone

11:57.249 --> 11:58.584
with a financial interest in the place,

11:58.584 --> 11:59.585
who'd be stupid enough

11:59.585 --> 12:01.087
to spend a minute in
your rip-off joint?

12:29.115 --> 12:32.618
You try to help out a few
newly enterprising friends

12:32.618 --> 12:34.120
and what do you get for your trouble?

12:34.120 --> 12:37.123
45 minutes in hell.

12:37.123 --> 12:38.624
Sit. Keep it down, will ya?

12:38.624 --> 12:39.625
Keep it down here.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.010
Keep it down?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.878
I've got the worst sunburn of my life,

12:42.878 --> 12:44.880
thanks to a faulty thermo-regulator

12:44.880 --> 12:46.882
on tanning machine number three,

12:46.882 --> 12:48.384
the Bahama Mama.

12:48.384 --> 12:50.302
Frasier,

12:50.302 --> 12:53.305
you're supposed to start
off slowly, all right?

12:53.305 --> 12:54.807
But I must say, you do have

12:54.807 --> 12:56.308
one heck of a fantastic

12:56.308 --> 12:57.810
base coat there, Fras.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.695
Yeah. Yeah, and your, uh,

12:59.695 --> 13:01.981
your shirt sure smells fresher.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.232
Really?

13:03.232 --> 13:04.533
It's not too lemony?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.035
Not for you.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.539
(humming "Isn't It Romantic")

13:10.539 --> 13:18.547
(humming)

13:20.416 --> 13:22.218
Sorry.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.805
(humming)

13:25.805 --> 13:27.807
Well, it's just that

13:27.807 --> 13:30.810
it's such a lovely, sunny day out...

13:31.310 --> 13:35.314
as your tanned faces will attest.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.318
Well, I guess I'm feeling
especially girlish.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.820
How come, Miss Chambers?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.321
Nah, nah, nah, don't, don't.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.828
You know, Woody--
the usual thing

13:48.828 --> 13:51.330
that puts a bounce in a girl's step.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.332
Ah! Support hose.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.839
You're adorable.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.341
No, I'm referring to

14:02.341 --> 14:04.343
a very special evening.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.845
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.848
Didn't you have a date
or something last night?

14:08.848 --> 14:12.351
You know perfectly
well I saw Chad, but--

14:12.351 --> 14:14.353
it was no big deal.

14:14.353 --> 14:19.358
(humming "Isn't It Romantic")

14:19.358 --> 14:20.860
Yeah.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.363
I refuse to ask her about last night.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.365
You ask her, Woody.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.366
Gotcha.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.871
Well, looky here.

14:31.871 --> 14:36.375
The paper predicts the same
high for Boston as Honolulu.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.878
That is Honolulu, Hawaii,

14:38.878 --> 14:41.380
the state where you can get
a free tan all year round.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.798
Carla, if you're
trying to say something,

14:43.299 --> 14:44.800
why don't you just
spit it out, all right?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.803
Tan 'N' Wash bites it.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.806
Okay, I'll admit Indian
summer's killing us temporarily,

14:50.806 --> 14:52.174
but this is Boston.

14:52.174 --> 14:54.643
It's gonna get cold.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.146
(humming "Isn't It Romantic")

15:02.351 --> 15:03.352
Hey, Sam.

15:03.352 --> 15:05.854
I found out all about
Miss Chambers' date.

15:05.854 --> 15:07.606
I mean, uh...

15:07.606 --> 15:10.442
beautiful night of magic.

15:10.442 --> 15:11.443
Just spill it, will ya, Woody?

15:11.944 --> 15:16.448
Well, the ballet was exquisite,

15:16.448 --> 15:18.450
but it paled by comparison

15:18.951 --> 15:22.454
to the enchanting coach
ride under the stars.

15:22.454 --> 15:27.459
Chad held her porcelain
- like hand lightly,

15:27.960 --> 15:31.463
tracing tiny circles on her alamander...

15:31.463 --> 15:32.464
Alabaster.

15:32.464 --> 15:33.966
...alabaster skin,

15:35.968 --> 15:39.972
and then, fearing that
the spell might be broken,

15:39.972 --> 15:43.475
she invited him up
to her pied-de-teer

15:43.475 --> 15:45.477
for some quiet conversation

15:45.477 --> 15:47.479
and warm brandy, and then...

15:47.479 --> 15:48.480
What?

15:48.480 --> 15:50.482
Miss Chambers said if you want to hear

15:50.482 --> 15:52.484
the rest, you gotta ask her yourself.

15:52.985 --> 15:53.986
(laughing) Oh...

15:53.986 --> 15:56.989
Forget it! Forget it, man!

15:56.989 --> 15:58.490
Oh, ask her, Sam.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.492
Sounds like you won't be disappointed.

16:00.993 --> 16:01.994
Forget it.

16:07.082 --> 16:09.084
Frasier, a sunburn?

16:09.084 --> 16:11.804
No, I'm doing my impression
of a blood blister.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.892
CARLA: Hey, Frasier.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.645
You know, there's something I've
always been meaning to ask you.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.146
What was your reaction

16:21.146 --> 16:22.648
the first time you saw Diane naked?

16:22.648 --> 16:23.649
(screams in pain)

16:32.775 --> 16:35.611
Normie, I can't hold out any longer.

16:35.611 --> 16:37.613
Ma's getting antsy.

16:37.613 --> 16:39.615
The last time she
spent a thousand dollars

16:39.615 --> 16:40.616
was on a house.

16:40.616 --> 16:41.617
Cliff, I'm sorry.

16:41.617 --> 16:43.118
I-I really am, but you guys

16:43.118 --> 16:44.119
begged me to let ya in.

16:44.119 --> 16:45.587
It's not like I didn't warn you.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.955
CARLA: Oh, sure.

16:46.955 --> 16:49.875
"Don't do this. I pray
to God you don't do this."

16:49.875 --> 16:51.877
You call that a warning?

16:51.877 --> 16:54.263
You know, I predicted this. You guys are

16:54.263 --> 16:56.048
nervous Nellies and you're
trying to blame it all on me.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.549
I want out, Norm.

16:57.549 --> 16:58.550
Yeah, me, too.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.436
Who wants a tan in the winter anyway?

17:00.436 --> 17:01.854
Wait, wait. This is not the smart move.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.855
You gotta hang in there.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.356
You gotta roll with
the punches, all right?

17:04.356 --> 17:05.858
You're gonna roll with the punches

17:05.858 --> 17:07.108
if you don't get us outta this.

17:07.108 --> 17:07.943
Nah, I just don't think

17:07.943 --> 17:08.944
that we're cut out for it.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.445
No. Apparently not, all right?

17:10.445 --> 17:13.449
Yeah, geez, have it
your way, guys, okay?

17:13.449 --> 17:14.950
Look, all right, I tell ya what. Okay?

17:14.950 --> 17:17.453
I'll personally buy out
your shares, all right?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.454
I'll have your checks in
the mail within a week.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.824
Stupid mistake. Stupid.

17:21.824 --> 17:23.208
Stupid.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.752
Ooh, ooh, boy.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.255
It's still snowing out there.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.640
Yeah, and every flake means

17:38.640 --> 17:41.927
another buck in Norm's pocket.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.312
You, you guys still moaning

17:43.312 --> 17:44.813
because Norm hit the
jackpot and you didn't?

17:45.314 --> 17:46.815
Hey, come on, Paul, give us some credit

17:46.815 --> 17:48.817
for being adults, huh?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.320
Hey, what do you say we
toilet paper his house?

17:51.320 --> 17:53.822
Nah, it'd only make it look better.

17:56.358 --> 17:57.860
Sam, excuse me.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.745
May I have your ear for a moment?

17:59.745 --> 18:02.081
Sure. Just don't leave any bite marks.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.834
Sam, I've decided

18:05.834 --> 18:08.337
to break off my relationship with Chad.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.288
Who?

18:10.789 --> 18:13.041
What an actor you are.

18:13.041 --> 18:14.843
You know, if you hadn't
chosen bartending,

18:14.843 --> 18:15.711
you could well have had

18:15.711 --> 18:17.463
a career in the theater.

18:17.463 --> 18:18.931
Or as a model.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.435
Anyway, you needn't continue

18:23.936 --> 18:25.437
this charade of nonchalance.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.439
I'm ending my affaire de coeur

18:27.439 --> 18:31.443
because I can sense how it's
secretly gnawing away at you.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.948
Okay. all right.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.449
I'm glad.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.452
All I've been able to
think about is you and Chad.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.788
In your apartment.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.541
In his car, on the stairs.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.044
Doing things even we never did.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.412
I mean, I can't eat,

18:50.412 --> 18:51.330
I can't sleep.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.714
Oh, Sam. Really?

18:52.714 --> 18:55.551
Gee, maybe I could have been an actor.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.919
Oh!

18:59.922 --> 19:01.807
Afternoon, everybody.

19:05.928 --> 19:06.929
Norm!

19:08.931 --> 19:09.932
Norman.

19:10.933 --> 19:13.435
How're you feeling today, Norm?

19:13.435 --> 19:14.436
Rich and thirsty.

19:14.436 --> 19:15.437
Pour me a beer.

19:16.438 --> 19:18.440
Yes, sir, Mr. Peterson.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.326
Boy, you sure have
gotten successful, huh?

19:21.326 --> 19:24.112
Well, Woody, you know what
they say about success.

19:24.112 --> 19:26.999
It's one percent inspiration
and 99 percent perspiration.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.333
So is your shirt.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.118
Yeah, and you know what else they

19:30.118 --> 19:33.088
say about success
there, Mr. Rockeflounder?

19:34.456 --> 19:36.625
It's lonely at the top.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.927
Yeah, but the food's better, Cliff.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.763
Hey, you don't have to rub

19:41.763 --> 19:42.764
our noses in it, man.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.133
I mean, we're your friends, after all.

19:45.133 --> 19:46.101
Friends?

19:46.101 --> 19:48.103
You call yourselves friends?

19:48.103 --> 19:49.605
The last four or five
times I've walked in here,

19:49.605 --> 19:51.607
you treat me as if I've
done something wrong.

19:53.976 --> 19:55.811
You know, not one of
you guys has bothered

19:55.811 --> 19:57.196
to congratulate me for my success.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.314
Which, I might add, you all had

19:59.314 --> 20:01.483
a chance to share in.

20:01.483 --> 20:05.954
Maybe I should just take my
refreshment business elsewhere.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.957
When I think of all the
hours I wasted in here

20:08.957 --> 20:11.460
when I could have been
wasting them somewhere else.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.462
DIANE: Norman, Norman.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.963
Please don't leave.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.965
We're taking it out on you,

20:16.965 --> 20:18.967
but we're really mad at ourselves.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.970
The hostility you're feeling
is for our own stupidity

20:21.970 --> 20:23.472
at bailing out of this project.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.340
Right, everyone?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.729
You guys are beautiful.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.731
Oh, well, come on, wait a second.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.900
Come on back here.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.184
Yeah, we've been actin'
like creeps, Normie.

20:36.184 --> 20:38.403
CARLA: I'll fluff up
your favorite stool.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.689
Yeah, I'll open a fresh bag of pretzels.

20:40.689 --> 20:41.690
And I'll pour you a beer

20:41.690 --> 20:43.692
just the way you like
it-- within reach.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.863
What we're trying to say here is,

20:47.863 --> 20:48.747
we're sorry.

20:48.747 --> 20:49.748
CLIFF: Yeah.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.500
You had the guts to stick it out,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.702
and we didn't, and you deserve

20:53.702 --> 20:55.921
all the success now.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.173
Thank you, Sam. Guys.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.175
I'm really glad to
hear that because, uh,

21:00.175 --> 21:01.677
I have a little surprise for you guys.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.679
I never took you out
of Tan 'N' Wash at all.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.180
And here are your first dividend checks

21:05.180 --> 21:06.181
right here, huh?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.683
Oh, Norman!

21:07.683 --> 21:09.184
You're kidding me.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.186
(all talking excitedly)

21:11.186 --> 21:14.189
ALL: ? For he's a jolly good fellow ?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.191
? For he's a jolly good fellow, ?

21:16.191 --> 21:18.560
? For he's a jolly good
fellow, ? (phone rings)

21:18.560 --> 21:19.561
WOODY: Cheers.

21:19.561 --> 21:20.312
It's for you.

21:20.312 --> 21:21.196
Put 'em on hold.

21:21.196 --> 21:25.567
? Which nobody can deny. ?

21:25.567 --> 21:26.451
Hey. All right.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.452
This is great.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.204
Hey, look at that! It's snowing

21:29.204 --> 21:30.038
even harder out now.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.290
Oh, it's a harbinger

21:31.290 --> 21:32.624
of good fortune!

21:32.624 --> 21:34.376
You said it, bone butt!

21:36.578 --> 21:39.798
Snow today means dough tomorrow.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.583
Hey, let's carry Mr. Peterson

21:41.583 --> 21:43.085
around the bar on our shoulders

21:43.585 --> 21:45.087
and then go play in the snow.

21:45.087 --> 21:47.089
Let's go play in the snow.

21:47.089 --> 21:48.590
Hold it! Hold it!

21:48.590 --> 21:50.592
Last one out's a Clavin.

21:51.593 --> 21:53.595
No, you're not. You're
not gonna get me this time.

21:55.097 --> 21:58.100
Oh, I'm always the Clavin.

22:00.102 --> 22:02.604
Ah, Woody. Woody, Woody, Woody.

22:02.604 --> 22:03.989
Look at them, huh?

22:03.989 --> 22:04.940
Isn't that great?

22:04.940 --> 22:06.825
They're singin' and dancin'.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.744
It gives me a great feeling all over

22:08.744 --> 22:10.612
to do something good for those people.

22:10.612 --> 22:13.448
Oh, speaking of people,
you got one on hold here.

22:16.918 --> 22:20.422
Hello. Yeah, hi.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.923
Oh, no. No.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.925
No, get out. No!

22:23.925 --> 22:25.427
What're you...?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.928
No, man, no!

22:26.928 --> 22:28.930
No...

22:28.930 --> 22:29.931
Well, at least we...

22:29.931 --> 22:31.933
No?!

22:31.933 --> 22:34.936
We, no, but wait a, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.943
Bad news, Mr. Peterson?

22:43.895 --> 22:45.647
Wrong number, Woody.

22:46.948 --> 22:47.949
Aren't those annoying?

23:05.967 --> 23:06.968
(all yelling, laughing)

23:06.968 --> 23:09.971
Uh... Huh! Guys! Good friends!

23:09.971 --> 23:12.474
Listen, people, uh, excuse me!

23:12.474 --> 23:14.976
Listen, I know things have
been going just beautifully,

23:14.976 --> 23:16.845
but, uh, hey, would you stop jumping

23:16.845 --> 23:19.181
up and down for a second?!

23:19.181 --> 23:20.682
Thank you.

23:20.682 --> 23:23.685
Now let's just take a
hypothetical situation.

23:23.685 --> 23:26.688
Just for fun, let's just
say that the roof collapsed

23:26.688 --> 23:29.191
over at Tan 'N' Wash from
the weight of all this snow

23:29.191 --> 23:31.693
and by some little quirk we
didn't have any insurance.

23:31.693 --> 23:33.695
How would you guys feel about that, huh?

23:39.201 --> 23:40.702
Just checking.
