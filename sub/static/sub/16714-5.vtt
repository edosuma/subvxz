00:13.690 --> 00:15.223
Oh, I love this song.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.060
Turn it down. I don't
want my parents to hear us.

00:19.062 --> 00:22.664
You're already busted. Your mom's
been blowing up your phone with texts.

00:22.666 --> 00:25.233
Yeah. She hates when I break curfew.

00:25.235 --> 00:26.467
At least it was worth it.

00:26.469 --> 00:27.468
Ha ha.

00:27.470 --> 00:29.037
Later bitches.

00:29.039 --> 00:30.471
Bye.

00:30.473 --> 00:33.307
See you, Mandy!

00:42.552 --> 00:45.219
Damn.

01:02.272 --> 01:04.105
Daddy?

01:07.077 --> 01:08.609
Mom...

01:14.884 --> 01:16.184
Aah!

01:29.065 --> 01:31.699
It's just a little something.

01:31.701 --> 01:32.867
For me?

01:32.869 --> 01:34.202
No, not for you. It's for Roxy.

01:34.204 --> 01:37.004
But you have opposable thumbs,
so you can open it for her.

01:37.006 --> 01:38.940
Wow. Biscuits.

01:38.942 --> 01:40.508
Yeah. They're all organic.

01:40.510 --> 01:43.044
Human grade. Quite delicious,
if I do say so myself.

01:43.046 --> 01:44.479
Uh, plus...

01:51.215 --> 01:52.348
It's a sweater.

01:52.455 --> 01:53.788
Oh! Isn't it amazing?

01:53.790 --> 01:56.824
It is... Amazing.

01:57.502 --> 01:58.568
What was that?

01:59.945 --> 02:00.874
Huh? What was what?

02:00.908 --> 02:02.041
You paused.

02:02.043 --> 02:03.042
No, I didn't.

02:03.044 --> 02:03.547
You don't like it.

02:03.610 --> 02:04.943
No, I didn't... I didn't say that.

02:05.403 --> 02:06.846
Oh, you might be a profiler in training,

02:06.846 --> 02:08.312
but I'm a profiler by association,

02:08.315 --> 02:10.615
and I can tell a lie when I hear one,

02:10.616 --> 02:11.816
and liar.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.021
Ok. I'm sorry.

02:17.023 --> 02:18.423
It...

02:18.425 --> 02:20.191
It's the biscuits.

02:20.193 --> 02:23.561
You know, Roxy,
 she's on a raw food diet.

02:23.563 --> 02:24.863
Oh.

02:25.964 --> 02:28.831
They're mostly peanut
butter, but my bad. Ok.

02:28.833 --> 02:30.233
But this is great, huh?

02:30.235 --> 02:32.635
Y-yeah. This is...

02:32.637 --> 02:33.236
This is amazing.

02:33.476 --> 02:34.676
It is.

02:34.678 --> 02:36.711
And very, very thoughtful.

02:36.713 --> 02:37.579
It was, wasn't it?

02:37.581 --> 02:38.713
It was. Thank you.

02:38.715 --> 02:40.014
You're welcome. Roxy's welcome.

02:40.016 --> 02:40.648
I can't wait to see her in it.

02:40.650 --> 02:42.116
Oh.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.518
We got a case.

02:50.298 --> 02:52.493
The Bergstrom family was killed

02:52.495 --> 02:54.996
in their home in Winona,
Minnesota, last night.

02:54.998 --> 02:57.432
Mother, Father, and little boy,

02:57.434 --> 02:58.833
all shot execution style.

02:58.835 --> 03:00.268
Any suspects?

03:00.270 --> 03:02.637
Therein lies the mystery.
The Bergstrom family

03:02.639 --> 03:03.638
was as low-risk as they come.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.906
What about murder-suicide?

03:04.908 --> 03:06.874
That was ruled out.
There was no murder weapon

03:06.876 --> 03:09.210
found at the scene, and both
Bridget and Scott Bergstrom

03:09.212 --> 03:10.612
were shot in their bed.

03:10.614 --> 03:12.947
But there was a survivor.
A teenage daughter.

03:12.949 --> 03:15.350
17-year-old Amanda.

03:15.352 --> 03:17.819
She was out past her curfew
at the time of the murders.

03:17.821 --> 03:19.687
And she's the one that found the bodies.

03:19.689 --> 03:21.756
It almost seems like a hit man scenario.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.291
Maybe a mafia retaliation kill?

03:23.293 --> 03:26.094
But that doesn't seem
likely in Winona, Minnesota.

03:26.096 --> 03:28.763
But it does seem like a revenge killing.

03:28.765 --> 03:30.765
If the unsub expected to
wipe out the entire family,

03:30.767 --> 03:32.934
he screwed up big time
leaving Amanda alive.

03:32.936 --> 03:34.802
Unless she had something to do with it.

03:34.804 --> 03:37.105
That's a question mark, but according
to the M.E.'s preliminary report,

03:37.107 --> 03:39.273
she can't be the shooter, based
on alibi and time of deaths.

03:39.275 --> 03:41.042
On the surface, they
were a well-liked family,

03:41.044 --> 03:43.177
living a low-risk lifestyle.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.646
The daughter Amanda, where is she?

03:44.648 --> 03:45.947
Protective custody,

03:45.949 --> 03:48.683
in case the unsub sees
her as unfinished business.

03:48.685 --> 03:51.085
- We good?
- Mm-hmm.

03:51.087 --> 03:53.121
We fly.

Victor Hugo.

05:13.311 --> 05:15.444
Bridget and Scott
Bergstrom grew up in Winona

05:15.446 --> 05:17.413
and have deep ties to the community.

05:17.415 --> 05:20.082
Scott was a local
distributor of farm equipment.

05:20.084 --> 05:22.518
Bridget cut hair at a salon in the mall.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.620
Yet they were murdered
by a family annihilator.

05:24.622 --> 05:26.422
Sad but true. The Bergstrom family

05:26.424 --> 05:28.925
had their share of dirty laundry.
Though who of us does not?

05:28.927 --> 05:30.660
Scott developed a Vicodin
habit a few years back

05:30.662 --> 05:31.961
after a skiing accident.

05:31.963 --> 05:35.198
So he could have been in
over his head with his dealer.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.500
So Bridget was having an affair?

05:37.502 --> 05:39.535
Yeah. I looked at their financials.

05:39.537 --> 05:41.103
She's got a credit card
secret just in her name,

05:41.105 --> 05:44.707
with charges to a motel just
outside of town, and nothing else.

05:44.709 --> 05:45.975
She might have cut things off,

05:45.977 --> 05:47.343
causing him to go off the deep end.

05:47.345 --> 05:48.744
Can you get us a name?

05:48.746 --> 05:50.046
Yeah, I'm already into it.

05:50.048 --> 05:51.614
You'll have lover boy's I.D. asap.

05:51.616 --> 05:53.983
What about Amanda, the sole
survivor? Any motive there?

05:53.985 --> 05:55.818
Deep sigh. I hate that
you're asking that.

05:55.820 --> 05:58.855
And deep sigh again, I am bound
by duty to report the facts.

05:58.857 --> 06:00.489
There's a modest insurance policy.

06:00.491 --> 06:03.259
17-year-old Amanda is the beneficiary.

06:03.261 --> 06:05.261
$100,000.

06:05.263 --> 06:07.196
That would seem like all the
money in the world to a teenager.

06:07.198 --> 06:09.165
People have been killed for a lot less.

06:09.167 --> 06:12.201
That's an unlikely motive for the
daughter, but we can't rule her out.

06:12.203 --> 06:15.471
Whatever set this unsub off, he
made the whole family pay for it.

06:15.473 --> 06:17.106
Ok. JJ, Spencer, Emily,

06:17.108 --> 06:18.941
you go directly to the crime scene.

06:18.943 --> 06:22.245
Luke, you're with me. We'll
set up H.Q. at the local P.D.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.493
Unsub entered on the second floor

06:37.495 --> 06:38.862
through the cut screen.

06:40.537 --> 06:43.205
He had to be physically fit.

06:44.863 --> 06:49.099
He knew the house well enough to
know this was the room to enter.

06:52.637 --> 06:55.672
He went straight to the parents' room.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.756
He wanted to remove the
greatest threat first.

07:00.819 --> 07:02.408
Based on the bullet trajectory,

07:02.408 --> 07:05.171
he was standing here at the
foot of the bed when he fired.

07:05.171 --> 07:09.459
He wanted to stare at
them both before firing.

07:09.739 --> 07:11.539
And that woke Bridget up.

07:13.176 --> 07:16.845
She was attempting to flee
when the unsub shot her.

07:16.847 --> 07:18.546
Oh, no!

07:19.883 --> 07:21.749
Did he enjoy watching
her terror and panic,

07:21.751 --> 07:24.419
or was it inexperience on his part?

07:24.421 --> 07:26.020
Bridget's scream...

07:26.022 --> 07:27.689
Aah!

07:27.691 --> 07:30.191
is probably what woke Kevin.

07:30.193 --> 07:34.329
So the unsub heads down the hallway

07:34.331 --> 07:37.098
where Kevin is coming
out of his bedroom.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.733
Mom?

07:38.735 --> 07:39.834
Dad?

07:39.836 --> 07:42.403
And he runs into the unsub.

07:42.405 --> 07:43.773
Who are you?

07:56.853 --> 08:00.555
So it seems this unsub
knew who lived here

08:00.557 --> 08:01.990
and where each person slept

08:01.992 --> 08:04.158
implying a personal
connection to the victims.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.526
In spite of the home invasion,

08:05.528 --> 08:06.861
there's no sign of burglary,

08:06.863 --> 08:08.062
so he's mission-oriented.

08:08.064 --> 08:09.931
He's highly organized and sophisticated.

08:09.933 --> 08:11.666
The big question is Amanda.

08:11.668 --> 08:13.001
Did he think she was home,

08:13.003 --> 08:14.769
or did he deliberately
strike when she was out.

08:14.771 --> 08:16.438
We need to talk to her.

08:17.142 --> 08:18.890
Poor kid was so distraught,
we took her to the E.R.

08:19.239 --> 08:20.672
They ended up sedating her.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.150
She'll be coming around soon.

08:22.152 --> 08:25.387
I've got a deputy stationed outside
her room over at county general.

08:25.389 --> 08:27.589
Good. If the unsub wanted to
wipe out the entire family,

08:27.591 --> 08:29.224
she could be in danger.

08:29.226 --> 08:31.026
What about the wife, Bridget?

08:31.028 --> 08:34.095
We heard she might be
stepping out on her husband.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.996
Yeah, that was an open secret.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.631
She was seeing Ron Ferguson.

08:37.634 --> 08:40.101
They met at the gym. He was a trainer.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.102
Was? What happened?

08:41.104 --> 08:42.304
Sticky fingers.

08:42.306 --> 08:45.540
Ronnie got caught stealing
personal items from lockers.

08:45.542 --> 08:48.076
They called us over, but
nobody pressed charges.

08:48.078 --> 08:49.144
Just sent him packing.

08:49.146 --> 08:51.146
Ferguson sounds like bad news.

08:51.148 --> 08:52.380
He's no altar boy.

08:52.382 --> 08:54.816
Couple of DUls and a
few assault convictions.

08:54.818 --> 08:57.719
Bar fights, mostly.
But nothing like this.

08:57.721 --> 08:59.621
You don't think he's
involved in this, do you?

08:59.623 --> 09:01.923
The guy's got a temper
and he likes to drink.

09:01.925 --> 09:03.191
That's not a good combo.

09:03.869 --> 09:04.826
Where is he now?

09:04.828 --> 09:08.229
Living off unemployment,
just outside town out by I-90.

09:08.231 --> 09:10.199
Let's go talk to him.

09:11.201 --> 09:15.370
So, knocking on doors kind of
remind you of fugitive hunting?

09:15.372 --> 09:17.172
Yeah, a little bit.

09:17.174 --> 09:19.407
That was a... that was
a one-man show, though.

09:19.409 --> 09:21.042
And this is a team sport.

09:21.044 --> 09:22.277
Yeah.

09:22.279 --> 09:25.547
Yeah, well, that could take
a little getting used to.

09:25.549 --> 09:27.882
A little bit, yeah.

09:34.702 --> 09:36.191
This is it.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.328
Ronald Ferguson.

09:40.330 --> 09:44.032
FBI. Like to ask you a few questions.

09:51.375 --> 09:54.042
Where do you think you're going? Huh?

09:55.145 --> 09:57.479
This takes me back.

09:57.481 --> 09:59.547
I didn't do nothin'.

09:59.549 --> 10:02.050
We want to know about Bridget Bergstrom.

10:03.086 --> 10:05.220
I don't know, it was messed up.

10:05.222 --> 10:07.188
But I didn't have nothin' to do with it.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.491
Bridget and me broke up a while ago.

10:09.493 --> 10:11.626
Ok. Where were you last night?

10:11.628 --> 10:14.896
Out at the CC club... in town.

10:14.898 --> 10:17.565
My buddy Steve got in a fight, got cut,

10:17.567 --> 10:19.501
so I took him to the hospital.

10:19.503 --> 10:21.369
What about afterward?

10:21.371 --> 10:22.771
I was there all night.

10:22.773 --> 10:24.773
Waited with him while
he got stitched up.

10:24.775 --> 10:26.741
I didn't get home till almost 6 a.m.

10:26.743 --> 10:28.877
And there were security
cameras in the waiting area.

10:28.879 --> 10:29.944
You can check.

10:29.946 --> 10:31.279
We will.

10:31.281 --> 10:33.515
That's the truth.

10:33.517 --> 10:36.184
No matter what that little liar says.

10:36.186 --> 10:38.019
Who are you talking about?

10:38.955 --> 10:39.988
Amanda.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.122
Bridget's kid.

10:41.124 --> 10:45.226
She knew you were having
an affair with her mother?

10:45.228 --> 10:49.064
Yeah. And she blackmailed
me for almost a year.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.332
Threatened to tell her dad all the time.

10:51.334 --> 10:53.234
Amanda acts all innocent,

10:53.236 --> 10:57.305
but she's always working some angle.

10:58.842 --> 11:01.576
I was supposed to be home by 11:00.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.710
That's my curfew.

11:02.712 --> 11:06.815
But there was a party
and I stayed all night.

11:07.884 --> 11:13.088
My mom, she was really mad at me.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.256
She texted me...

11:15.258 --> 11:17.492
Sweetie, she wouldn't
have stayed mad at you.

11:17.494 --> 11:19.427
Ok? Please believe that.

11:20.631 --> 11:23.965
She said she was disappointed in me.

11:23.967 --> 11:26.134
That's the last text she sent.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.970
And I ignored it.

11:28.972 --> 11:31.906
Teenagers break curfew. It's normal.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.576
I'm sure she loved you very much.

11:36.313 --> 11:40.915
Amanda, we need your help
to find whoever did this.

11:40.917 --> 11:44.352
We need to ask you some
difficult questions, ok?

11:45.622 --> 11:46.955
Ok.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.791
Ron Ferguson said that you
knew about him and your mom.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.359
Is that true?

11:53.864 --> 11:54.963
Yeah.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.631
He said you threatened to tell your dad

11:56.633 --> 11:58.533
about the affair.

11:58.535 --> 12:02.570
Well, that was just to
keep him away from my mom.

12:02.572 --> 12:04.772
I didn't really want to tell my dad.

12:04.774 --> 12:06.508
I didn't want him to know.

12:06.510 --> 12:07.575
How come?

12:07.577 --> 12:09.344
Because of the pills?

12:11.281 --> 12:12.380
Yeah.

12:12.382 --> 12:15.083
Yeah, after my dad broke his leg,

12:15.085 --> 12:17.252
he got addicted.

12:17.254 --> 12:19.554
And, um...

12:19.556 --> 12:22.157
It was really bad for a while.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.893
And that's when your mom
started having the affair?

12:26.096 --> 12:27.428
He was always yelling,

12:27.430 --> 12:30.431
at everybody,

12:30.433 --> 12:31.733
even Kevin.

12:31.735 --> 12:35.537
And my mom and him almost split up.

12:35.539 --> 12:38.473
Then he worked really hard to get clean.

12:38.475 --> 12:40.608
I didn't want to tell him about Ron

12:40.610 --> 12:42.710
because I didn't want him to give up.

12:42.712 --> 12:45.547
He was doing N.A. and everything,

12:45.549 --> 12:46.814
and he was doing really good,

12:46.816 --> 12:49.417
and then my mom even thought so,

12:49.419 --> 12:51.119
and so when he got his 6-month chip,

12:51.121 --> 12:52.353
she broke up with Ron.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.522
How did Ron feel about that?

12:56.560 --> 12:58.860
Ok, I guess. I mean, I'm pretty sure

12:58.862 --> 13:01.496
he was already seeing someone else.

13:02.666 --> 13:06.100
Things were just starting
to get good again.

13:07.204 --> 13:10.738
I thought I was getting my family back.

13:12.075 --> 13:14.275
Why did this happen?

13:14.277 --> 13:17.212
Why is my family dead?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.616
Just got off the phone with Garcia.

13:21.618 --> 13:23.718
Ferguson's alibi checks out.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.220
I can't even begin to imagine it.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.956
Her whole family gone
in the blink of an eye.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.224
She's devastated.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.392
Ferguson seems to think that Amanda

13:31.394 --> 13:32.894
was some kind of conniving shrew.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.330
Well, Amanda may well have
been hostile towards him,

13:35.332 --> 13:37.131
but for good reason.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.234
She wanted her parents to
stay together. Typical kid.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.436
She was candid about what went on.

13:41.438 --> 13:44.239
She was genuinely baffled
by who would do this and why.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.541
Agreed. That last text from her mom,

13:46.543 --> 13:47.809
that one's gonna haunt her.

13:47.811 --> 13:49.244
What's gonna happen to her now?

13:49.246 --> 13:50.979
She has an aunt and uncle in Seattle.

13:50.981 --> 13:54.515
They flew in today. So it sounds
like she'll be going home with them.

13:54.517 --> 13:56.417
We know Ferguson's way too disorganized

13:56.419 --> 14:00.321
to pull this off, so
where does that leave us?

14:00.323 --> 14:03.458
The family had their problems, but
they were getting back on track.

14:03.460 --> 14:06.060
And yet someone wanted this family dead.

14:06.062 --> 14:09.931
But it doesn't make sense that they'd
be targeted by a family annihilator.

14:09.933 --> 14:14.335
What if it's not about this family?

14:14.337 --> 14:17.538
What if it's just about families?

14:17.540 --> 14:20.608
So the Bergstroms could be surrogates.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.312
Meaning our unsub will
probably strike again.

14:45.935 --> 14:47.602
Hey.

15:31.047 --> 15:32.347
911. What's your emergency?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.382
Please help.

15:36.820 --> 15:38.486
There's someone in my house.

15:38.488 --> 15:39.487
He's shooting.

15:39.489 --> 15:40.788
Sir, I can't hear you.

15:40.790 --> 15:43.424
If you're unable to speak,
just press any button.

15:44.794 --> 15:46.094
Are you there, sir?

15:47.163 --> 15:48.229
Ok, we'll track your phone

15:48.231 --> 15:50.431
and send someone to your address.

16:34.107 --> 16:35.406
FBI!

16:35.408 --> 16:37.108
Body down.

16:39.724 --> 16:43.126
I have two bodies down back here.

17:02.905 --> 17:05.071
Let me see your hands.

17:05.074 --> 17:07.141
Let me see your hands.

17:15.012 --> 17:17.613
You're safe now, Matthew.

17:17.615 --> 17:19.648
You're safe.

17:21.089 --> 17:25.858
Matthew, we want to find who did this.

17:25.859 --> 17:29.162
So if there's anything you
can remember seeing or hearing,

17:29.164 --> 17:33.499
anything at all, it could help us.

17:37.572 --> 17:40.940
What you did, calling
911, that was brave.

17:40.942 --> 17:44.010
That call saved your life.

17:45.146 --> 17:46.179
Anything?

17:46.181 --> 17:49.148
He's traumatized.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.257
I heard him walking.

18:01.763 --> 18:04.197
Then he stopped.

18:06.334 --> 18:09.736
He was in my room.

18:09.738 --> 18:11.738
Right there.

18:14.109 --> 18:17.210
Why am I alive?

18:17.212 --> 18:19.846
Why me?

18:22.384 --> 18:24.751
Wish we had an answer for him.

18:24.753 --> 18:28.421
He's right. The unsub must
have known he was there.

18:28.423 --> 18:31.958
If he was in that bedroom,
he would have seen the puddle,

18:31.960 --> 18:33.893
just like Alvez did.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.229
The unsub deliberately spared him.

18:36.231 --> 18:37.730
But not out of compassion.

18:37.732 --> 18:42.135
He wanted them to feel the
pain of losing their families.

18:42.137 --> 18:45.238
I think we've inverted our victimology.

18:45.240 --> 18:49.108
We've been focused on the
murdered family members.

18:49.110 --> 18:52.211
We should be focusing on the survivors.

18:52.213 --> 18:54.347
They are the real victims,

18:54.349 --> 18:56.749
the ones the unsub wants to hurt.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.552
We believe the unsub is a variation

18:59.554 --> 19:02.288
of what we know as a family annihilator.

19:02.290 --> 19:05.124
The garden variety family annihilator

19:05.126 --> 19:08.194
is usually a narcissistic male patriarch

19:08.196 --> 19:11.030
experiencing psychological stress.

19:11.032 --> 19:14.567
This causes him to become
homicidal and then suicidal.

19:14.569 --> 19:17.203
His narcissism often manifests as rage

19:17.205 --> 19:18.938
directed at a specific family member,

19:18.940 --> 19:21.240
prompting him to
murder the entire family

19:21.242 --> 19:22.809
as an act of punishment and revenge.

19:22.811 --> 19:25.912
He then blames the object of his
rage for his violent outburst.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.714
Once the entire family is dead,

19:27.716 --> 19:31.250
the patriarch typically commits
or attempts to commit suicide.

19:31.252 --> 19:33.753
But this unsub is murdering families

19:33.755 --> 19:35.755
that are not his own.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.593
There's a distinct punishment
component to the annihilation

19:40.595 --> 19:42.061
that's driving this unsub.

19:42.063 --> 19:44.897
He's more organized than the
typical family annihilator,

19:44.899 --> 19:47.934
with greater impulse control and
a high level of sophistication.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.002
His sophistication is apparent

19:50.004 --> 19:52.371
in the fact that the object of his rage

19:52.373 --> 19:55.108
is deliberately spared
rather than murdered.

19:59.214 --> 20:01.581
This allows the unsub the satisfaction

20:01.583 --> 20:03.983
of inflicting ongoing psychological pain

20:03.985 --> 20:05.852
on the object of his rage.

20:05.854 --> 20:09.055
We're looking for a male
in his late 20s, early 30s.

20:09.057 --> 20:11.124
He's mature and highly intelligent.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.826
Amanda Bergstrom and Matthew
Doherty may be surrogates

20:13.828 --> 20:16.229
for individuals who wronged the unsub

20:16.231 --> 20:18.030
when he himself was an adolescent.

20:18.032 --> 20:20.133
Amanda and Matt both attend
Pillsbury High School,

20:20.135 --> 20:22.301
and we have not identified
any other connection

20:22.303 --> 20:23.503
between them or their families.

20:23.505 --> 20:25.605
Pay close attention to the faculty

20:25.607 --> 20:27.117
and administrators of the high school.

20:27.388 --> 20:30.238
A lot of the parents are wondering if
we should shut down the high school.

20:30.505 --> 20:32.979
The school itself has not
been a scene of violence.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.848
Closing it would not deter this unsub.

20:35.850 --> 20:38.351
We need you to beef up
patrols and warn the public

20:38.353 --> 20:39.852
of the ongoing danger.

20:39.854 --> 20:42.522
And we ask you to encourage

20:42.524 --> 20:44.490
the entire Pillsbury
high school community

20:44.492 --> 20:48.327
to report any suspicious
individuals they may encounter.

20:48.329 --> 20:50.530
Ok, that's it.

20:53.067 --> 20:54.167
Hi, folks.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.469
Thanks for showing up.

20:56.471 --> 20:58.638
We will be holding
these forums every day,

20:58.640 --> 20:59.839
before and after school,

20:59.841 --> 21:02.708
and I encourage all
students and parents to come

21:02.710 --> 21:04.310
as often as you want.

21:04.312 --> 21:07.880
Now I'll turn it over to Mr.
Bakken, our school counselor.

21:07.882 --> 21:10.116
Thanks, Mrs. Dahl.

21:10.118 --> 21:12.552
We welcome all members
of our Pillsbury family.

21:12.554 --> 21:15.421
I'd like us all to start
by acknowledging the hurt

21:15.423 --> 21:18.558
that each and every one of of
us has experienced this week.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.326
Students, if you're here with a parent,

21:20.328 --> 21:22.428
please turn to him
or her now and just...

21:22.430 --> 21:24.931
Just label your feelings.

21:24.933 --> 21:28.634
Sad, scared, depressed, angry.

21:28.636 --> 21:29.936
Whatever you're feeling.

21:29.938 --> 21:32.271
Seriously?

21:33.107 --> 21:35.208
I told you this would be stupid.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.276
We don't want to label our feelings.

21:37.278 --> 21:41.080
We want to know what you're doing
to protect our families and our kids.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.749
We are in constant contact
with law enforcement,

21:43.751 --> 21:46.085
but we just don't know
anything more than you do.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.553
Then what are we doing here?

21:47.555 --> 21:51.591
I want you to know that school
is a safe place for your kids.

21:51.593 --> 21:54.493
I don't need some loser
in a cardigan sweater

21:54.495 --> 21:56.429
telling me my kid's freaked out.

21:56.431 --> 21:58.931
I need to know the son
of a bitch who did this

21:58.933 --> 22:00.466
is going to jail.

22:11.579 --> 22:13.980
Good one, Austin.

22:13.982 --> 22:16.582
Ha ha! What are you looking at, loser?

22:16.584 --> 22:19.452
Ha ha ha. Oh, man.

22:19.454 --> 22:21.921
Shall we?

22:26.494 --> 22:29.161
Boom, baby.

22:29.163 --> 22:30.429
What's up, Garcia?

22:30.431 --> 22:32.565
Do you have any idea how many selfies

22:32.567 --> 22:36.102
the average teenager posts on
social media on any given day?

22:36.104 --> 22:38.170
I'm gonna tell you
before you say anything.

22:38.172 --> 22:40.606
So many. And like the guys, too.

22:40.608 --> 22:41.908
Actually, some studies indicate that men

22:41.910 --> 22:43.876
take twice as many selfies as women

22:43.878 --> 22:46.512
'cause it's considered to be an
acceptable form of male vanity.

22:46.514 --> 22:48.681
How many pictures of
yourself do you really need?

22:48.683 --> 22:51.517
And they're basically
making the same expression...

22:51.519 --> 22:52.885
Oh my God.

22:52.887 --> 22:55.755
Am I officially not young?

22:55.757 --> 22:58.991
You, my dear, are the
portrait of everlasting youth.

22:58.993 --> 23:00.459
I'm timeless, right. Good answer.

23:00.461 --> 23:01.761
Ok. Back to my point.

23:01.763 --> 23:04.964
I have been drilling into
the social media footprint

23:04.966 --> 23:07.199
of both of our adolescent survivors.

23:07.201 --> 23:09.669
Any connection between Amanda and Matt?

23:09.671 --> 23:12.104
Yeah. Stay with me while I
go around here for a second.

23:12.106 --> 23:14.740
So, basically, both
of their Facebook pages

23:14.742 --> 23:18.911
are just an outpouring of love
and support from their peers.

23:18.913 --> 23:21.647
And it's touching, really,
and it's very reassuring

23:21.649 --> 23:23.149
for the hope of our species.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.550
What did you mean, "basically"?

23:24.552 --> 23:26.319
In between all the wonderfulness,

23:26.321 --> 23:28.487
there's a tiny tributary
of nasty comments

23:28.489 --> 23:29.956
from some of their peers,

23:29.958 --> 23:32.858
saying that Matt and Amanda
got what they deserved.

23:32.860 --> 23:35.861
Well, they're kids. Kids
can be cruel and thoughtless.

23:35.863 --> 23:37.296
Right. But we all know that cruelty

23:37.298 --> 23:39.298
is sometimes inspired
by previous action,

23:39.300 --> 23:41.467
which made me wonder
what Matt and Amanda

23:41.469 --> 23:43.836
might have done to
provoke some of their peers

23:43.838 --> 23:45.805
to saying some of these
things on their Facebooks.

23:45.807 --> 23:47.807
So I looked into their school records,

23:47.809 --> 23:50.676
and both Matt and Amanda
have complaints against them

23:50.678 --> 23:52.812
for "harassing behavior."

23:52.814 --> 23:53.913
They're bullies.

23:53.915 --> 23:55.247
Were they disciplined?

23:55.249 --> 23:57.550
No. To paraphrase the
Violent Femmes song,

23:57.552 --> 23:59.852
nothing went down on
their permanent record.

23:59.854 --> 24:02.021
So the victims were also victimizers.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.890
If the unsub was bullied
himself as a teenager,

24:04.892 --> 24:06.993
that could be the
original narcissistic wound

24:06.995 --> 24:08.995
that's fueling his present day rage.

24:08.997 --> 24:12.198
Turning his surrogate
victimizers into victims

24:12.200 --> 24:14.166
is the point for our unsub.

24:14.168 --> 24:16.602
Bullying leaves lasting scars.

24:16.604 --> 24:19.505
Our unsub could be a teacher
or staff member at the school

24:19.507 --> 24:21.240
who seems himself as
an avenger of students

24:21.242 --> 24:22.675
who are current victims of bullying.

24:22.677 --> 24:24.744
Someone who punishes the
bullies when no one else does.

24:24.746 --> 24:26.545
From the unsub's point of view,

24:26.547 --> 24:29.148
the bullies themselves are
responsible for the violence

24:29.150 --> 24:30.916
he's perpetrating
against their families.

24:30.918 --> 24:32.485
We need to dig into the backgrounds

24:32.487 --> 24:34.653
of the teachers and
staff of Pillsbury High

24:34.655 --> 24:37.423
and identify anyone who
was bullied as a kid.

24:37.425 --> 24:39.959
Already got digital shovels
already throwin' up dirt.

24:39.961 --> 24:43.295
We also need a list of any
other known bullies at the school

24:43.297 --> 24:46.432
so that we can warn and
protect their families.

24:46.434 --> 24:47.967
Oh, here's something.

24:47.969 --> 24:51.637
There is a school counselor
there named Eric Bakken.

24:51.639 --> 24:53.906
Not only is he the school administrator

24:53.908 --> 24:56.876
who's in charge of handling bullying
complaints from the students,

24:56.878 --> 25:00.212
but when he was 15, he
was charged with assault.

25:00.214 --> 25:03.849
He was arrested. He claimed he
was provoked by a long-time bully,

25:03.851 --> 25:06.018
but the charges were dropped.

25:06.020 --> 25:08.020
Let's get him in here.

25:08.022 --> 25:13.959
In theory, our community has a
zero tolerance policy on bullying.

25:13.961 --> 25:16.228
But not in practice.

25:16.230 --> 25:19.932
In practice, most of the bullying
that goes on at Pillsbury High

25:19.934 --> 25:21.634
never makes it to my door.

25:21.636 --> 25:24.203
Why not?

25:24.205 --> 25:26.839
Coming forward requires courage

25:26.841 --> 25:29.875
and a willingness to claim the pain.

25:29.877 --> 25:31.210
That's hard.

25:31.212 --> 25:33.412
And sometimes, I'm sorry to say,

25:33.414 --> 25:36.048
can make things worse for the victim.

25:36.050 --> 25:38.350
It must be hard for you
to see kids being bullied,

25:38.352 --> 25:40.386
knowing you can't do
anything to stop it.

25:40.388 --> 25:41.954
It is.

25:41.956 --> 25:43.456
It must make you angry.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.157
Angry?

25:45.159 --> 25:46.292
Yes.

25:46.294 --> 25:49.795
I bet some of these
kids were best friends

25:49.797 --> 25:51.564
with the people who
started bullying them

25:51.566 --> 25:53.099
in junior high and high school.

25:53.101 --> 25:54.233
That's right.

25:54.235 --> 25:57.303
And it only intensifies
the pain for them.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.939
Was that your experience

25:59.941 --> 26:02.241
when you were bullied?

26:03.878 --> 26:05.544
It was.

26:05.546 --> 26:08.781
My best friend all
through elementary school

26:08.783 --> 26:10.549
and junior high.

26:10.551 --> 26:13.285
All of a sudden he
turned into a popular kid

26:13.287 --> 26:15.087
and I didn't.

26:15.089 --> 26:18.057
He never targeted me directly,

26:18.059 --> 26:20.960
but he also never stopped
his new cool best friend

26:20.962 --> 26:22.461
from tormenting me.

26:22.463 --> 26:26.165
At first I fought, with my fists.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.601
But that doesn't solve anything.

26:28.603 --> 26:31.971
It just landed me in more trouble.

26:31.973 --> 26:34.640
I've worked through my own experience.

26:34.642 --> 26:37.243
I had to in order to
work in a high school

26:37.245 --> 26:41.614
so I wouldn't project my own
experience onto any of the students.

26:41.616 --> 26:43.482
That sounds very healthy.

26:43.484 --> 26:44.683
Thank you.

26:44.685 --> 26:46.986
It was hard work,

26:46.988 --> 26:48.888
but well worth it.

26:48.890 --> 26:53.959
I know I can't help every
young person who needs it.

26:53.961 --> 26:56.028
And I know I'm a joke

26:56.030 --> 26:58.230
to lots of the students.

26:58.232 --> 27:00.900
But I do help some of them,

27:00.902 --> 27:05.471
and that makes everything worthwhile.

27:07.742 --> 27:08.741
Is Bakken our guy?

27:08.743 --> 27:11.477
No. He has none of
the rage our unsub has.

27:11.479 --> 27:13.445
But he did give us some names.

27:13.447 --> 27:15.781
Garcia sent the addresses of 6 students

27:15.783 --> 27:17.183
to your phones.

27:17.185 --> 27:19.351
They're the most notorious
bullies at the school.

27:19.353 --> 27:22.421
Now, they and their families
are in immediate danger.

27:22.423 --> 27:23.722
We need to warn them.

27:23.724 --> 27:26.125
All right, let's go.

27:31.532 --> 27:34.633
We've got 5 families safely
in protective custody.

27:34.635 --> 27:36.168
Good.

27:36.170 --> 27:39.238
That's the house up there.

27:44.979 --> 27:48.314
The front door's open.

27:58.392 --> 28:01.994
Austin. Austin, my son.

28:01.996 --> 28:04.697
My boy.

28:04.699 --> 28:06.098
My boy's dead.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.766
That's my boy.

28:07.768 --> 28:10.135
Please help him.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.964
M.E.'s preliminary time of death

28:19.966 --> 28:21.465
confirms that we
couldn't have missed him

28:21.467 --> 28:22.867
by more than a few minutes.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.168
There's extreme overkill here.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.875
Victim was shot 6 times
and then bludgeoned.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.236
He's decompensating.

28:28.236 --> 28:29.390
Or evolving.

28:29.390 --> 28:31.163
Yeah, he doesn't care
about the family anymore.

28:31.163 --> 28:33.210
He's going straight for the bully.

28:37.732 --> 28:39.131
Hey, guys.

28:42.970 --> 28:44.169
Austin's room.

28:44.171 --> 28:48.340
The other murders, the unsub
left the homes undisturbed.

28:48.342 --> 28:50.642
Well, it certainly looks like this

28:50.644 --> 28:52.144
is what he bludgeoned the victim with.

28:52.146 --> 28:54.646
He could have left it in the
living room with the body,

28:54.648 --> 28:56.014
but instead he brought it back in here

28:56.016 --> 28:58.484
and destroyed Austin's
other sports trophies.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.618
Yeah, you know, everything about this,

28:59.620 --> 29:01.086
the overkill, trashing the room,

29:01.088 --> 29:02.988
going after Austin's prizes,

29:02.990 --> 29:05.657
it fights against our
profile of mission-oriented

29:05.659 --> 29:07.559
organization and impulse control.

29:07.561 --> 29:10.329
He's more stressed now.
He knows we're closing in.

29:10.331 --> 29:12.131
It's more than that.

29:12.133 --> 29:14.867
His behavior reads juvenile.

29:16.103 --> 29:18.470
Our unsub isn't an adult,

29:18.472 --> 29:20.839
he's a child.

29:20.841 --> 29:24.443
I can't believe there's a
psycho murderer out there.

29:24.445 --> 29:28.714
I mean, nothing ever
happens here, and then this.

29:28.716 --> 29:29.882
It's so weird.

29:29.884 --> 29:33.652
Yeah. Maybe he's not a psycho.

29:33.654 --> 29:35.888
Seriously, dude?

29:37.191 --> 29:41.593
You know, I heard that
Matt cried in the closet

29:41.595 --> 29:43.729
when his family was getting killed.

29:43.731 --> 29:45.130
For real?

29:45.132 --> 29:46.165
Yeah.

29:46.167 --> 29:47.800
Where'd you hear that?

29:47.802 --> 29:49.835
What difference does it make?

29:49.837 --> 29:53.305
I don't know. It just makes you
feel sorry for him, that's all.

29:53.307 --> 29:54.273
What?

29:54.275 --> 29:57.342
His whole family got killed.

29:57.344 --> 30:00.546
And from ninth grade
until about a week ago,

30:00.548 --> 30:02.915
Matt Doherty made your
life a living hell.

30:02.917 --> 30:05.818
I know, but still...

30:06.754 --> 30:09.221
No wonder you're a punching bag.

30:17.083 --> 30:20.429
Do you even remember why we
started the Anti-Terror Squad?

30:20.599 --> 30:22.844
To help protect each other
from bullies in school.

30:22.844 --> 30:26.090
And we said the bullies are
terrorists. Do you remember that?

30:26.092 --> 30:29.626
Yeah, but the Anti-Terror Squad
is just a name.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.463
It's just something we made
up to feel less pathetic.

30:31.483 --> 30:34.965
We're not the pathetic ones.

30:34.967 --> 30:35.966
They are.

30:35.968 --> 30:39.070
Zach, they are terrorists.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.373
God.

30:43.118 --> 30:44.407
You know what some politicians say.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.074
The best way to handle terrorists

30:46.076 --> 30:48.943
is to take out their whole families.

30:48.945 --> 30:50.411
That's messed up, man.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.247
Nobody's family deserves
to die like that.

30:53.249 --> 30:55.383
Not even the families
of real terrorists.

30:55.385 --> 30:56.651
Pull over.

30:56.653 --> 30:58.252
Why? I can just drop you at your house.

30:58.254 --> 30:59.854
Yeah, I'd rather walk.

31:07.998 --> 31:09.197
Garcia, we need the records

31:09.199 --> 31:10.865
of every student at Pillsbury

31:10.867 --> 31:12.533
who filed a bullying complaint

31:12.535 --> 31:16.237
against Amanda Bergstrom, Matt Doherty,

31:16.239 --> 31:17.705
and Austin Settergren.

31:17.707 --> 31:20.742
Also, anyone who received counseling

31:20.744 --> 31:23.411
for being bullied by those students.

31:23.413 --> 31:26.481
Wow. This is a really big pool.

31:26.483 --> 31:27.882
I've got 27 names.

31:27.884 --> 31:29.659
Any of those students bullied by all 3?

31:31.718 --> 31:32.851
No.

31:32.853 --> 31:35.320
Like Bakken said, most
victims never come forward.

31:35.322 --> 31:37.289
So I'm seeing the tip
of a really big iceberg.

31:37.291 --> 31:39.257
Nobody wants to be a snitch.

31:39.259 --> 31:42.327
Also, bullying is often so
widespread, it's normalized.

31:42.329 --> 31:45.931
It would only amplify the
unsub's feeling of powerlessness.

31:45.933 --> 31:50.135
But he didn't actually say
he killed anybody, right?

31:50.137 --> 31:51.536
He practically said it.

31:51.538 --> 31:53.472
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

31:53.474 --> 31:55.607
What did he say exactly?

31:55.609 --> 31:59.077
He said Amanda and Matt
deserved what happened to them.

31:59.079 --> 32:02.747
I feel really bad about
what happened. I do.

32:02.749 --> 32:06.184
But for like a nanosecond
I thought the same thing.

32:06.186 --> 32:09.921
Don't judge. I already
feel guilty enough about it.

32:09.923 --> 32:11.857
I get what Kyle's talking about.

32:11.859 --> 32:14.893
I mean, just because something
awful happened to them

32:14.895 --> 32:16.595
doesn't make them good
people all of a sudden.

32:16.597 --> 32:19.264
Amanda's still Amanda.
Her and all her friends

32:19.266 --> 32:22.467
have been really mean to
me since like fifth grade.

32:22.469 --> 32:25.604
So, you don't think I should
tell the cops about this?

32:25.606 --> 32:26.938
We gotta tell somebody.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.240
No, we don't.

32:28.242 --> 32:29.875
People are dead.

32:29.877 --> 32:33.378
But if you're wrong, you
could ruin Kyle's life.

32:33.380 --> 32:36.414
Think about it. He could get railroaded

32:36.416 --> 32:38.650
by all the hysterical
nut cases in this town

32:38.652 --> 32:42.454
and the star of "Making
a murder," season 8.

32:42.456 --> 32:45.891
If Kyle's off the rails,
we need to tell somebody.

32:45.893 --> 32:47.058
Hey.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.828
No one told me that
the Squad was meeting.

32:49.830 --> 32:52.631
Oh, it's not really a meeting.

32:52.633 --> 32:53.832
It kind of looks like one.

32:53.834 --> 32:55.433
So, please, I don't want to interrupt.

32:55.435 --> 32:59.638
What was that about
Kyle going off the rails?

33:03.610 --> 33:06.611
The pool of suspects is still too big.

33:06.613 --> 33:09.681
Garcia, can you cross-check
the names you pulled

33:09.683 --> 33:12.717
with any mentions on
social media of bullying?

33:12.719 --> 33:14.352
Oh, there's a boss idea.

33:14.354 --> 33:16.755
I'm gonna do that right now, and...

33:16.757 --> 33:19.858
Oh, this is interesting. I
pulled up 6 names from my list,

33:19.860 --> 33:22.827
and they all belong to
a private chat group.

33:22.829 --> 33:24.963
Some kind of bullying support group?

33:24.965 --> 33:28.366
It's called the Anti-Terror Squad,

33:28.368 --> 33:30.435
but, yeah, that's exactly what it is.

33:30.437 --> 33:32.003
It's an apt analogy.

33:32.005 --> 33:35.607
Ongoing bullying would feel like
terrorism to those experiencing it.

33:35.609 --> 33:37.676
They warn each other
about which stairwells

33:37.678 --> 33:39.844
and bathrooms to avoid on any given day.

33:39.846 --> 33:42.147
They walk each other to and
from school. That kind of thing.

33:42.149 --> 33:44.015
I tell Henry school's a safe place,

33:44.017 --> 33:46.117
but for these kids it's anything but.

33:46.119 --> 33:50.221
Are there any mentions of
retribution or payback, planning?

33:50.223 --> 33:51.923
No. But there's a lot of content here.

33:51.925 --> 33:53.925
I'll do a keyboard
search. It'll take a while.

33:53.927 --> 33:57.529
Ok, so these kids took back some
of their power by banding together.

33:57.531 --> 33:59.764
They call themselves
the Anti-Terror Squad,

33:59.766 --> 34:02.100
so they see themselves as righteous.

34:02.102 --> 34:05.337
The unsub may be one
or all 6 of these kids.

34:05.339 --> 34:07.839
Garcia, I need you to
locate their cell phones.

34:07.841 --> 34:09.674
Sure. Um...

34:09.676 --> 34:11.443
They're all in the exact same place.

34:11.445 --> 34:13.712
All 6 of them are in a
classroom at Pillsbury High.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.516
All right, look, there
are 5 cell phones here

34:19.518 --> 34:21.119
and there are 6 members of the club.

34:21.121 --> 34:22.387
Garcia, what have you got?

34:22.389 --> 34:26.123
These kids would never
voluntarily leave their phones.

34:26.126 --> 34:27.993
Whoever's still got
their phone is our unsub.

34:27.995 --> 34:29.460
If his friends turned on him,

34:29.463 --> 34:32.063
the unsub would experience
that as a huge betrayal.

34:32.065 --> 34:34.565
He's been killing for them
and he's just discovered

34:34.568 --> 34:36.400
they're not grateful to him for it.

34:36.402 --> 34:37.502
Ok.

34:37.504 --> 34:39.638
The kid whose phone isn't here

34:39.639 --> 34:40.804
is Kyle Ecklund. He's our unsub.

34:40.806 --> 34:42.072
But there's no signal.

34:42.074 --> 34:43.408
What do we know about him?

34:43.409 --> 34:45.443
Bare bones biographical details.

34:45.445 --> 34:48.446
He's an only child. Mom
left him as a toddler.

34:48.447 --> 34:49.813
His dad's an alcoholic.

34:49.815 --> 34:51.382
That explains why he's mature.

34:51.385 --> 34:54.284
Without a reliable caretaker, he
was parentified at an early age.

34:54.286 --> 34:56.621
And now he's switched
the focus of his rage

34:56.623 --> 34:58.556
from bullies to his own peer group.

34:58.558 --> 35:01.192
The family he's seeking
to annihilate has expanded.

35:01.194 --> 35:02.460
Yeah, but if he wanted to kill them,

35:02.462 --> 35:04.162
why wouldn't he do it here?
Why move them?

35:04.164 --> 35:07.465
He's making a statement.

35:07.467 --> 35:09.634
You don't have to do this, Kyle.

35:09.636 --> 35:11.136
I didn't have to do any of it.

35:11.138 --> 35:12.404
I did this for you, Zach.

35:12.406 --> 35:14.973
And you, Megan. Sam, Ryan, Josh.

35:14.975 --> 35:17.475
I did this for every time

35:17.477 --> 35:20.612
that we got tripped
or punched or spit on.

35:20.614 --> 35:22.180
I did this for me.

35:22.182 --> 35:23.314
Please, Kyle!

35:23.316 --> 35:26.317
Shut up! Keep walking!

35:29.587 --> 35:32.037
Kyle Ecklund has been
bullied for a lot of years

35:32.037 --> 35:34.194
by a lot of kids. I mean a lot of kids.

35:34.194 --> 35:36.794
He unleashed on Austin Settergren.

35:36.794 --> 35:37.409
What did Austin do to him?

35:38.482 --> 35:41.286
Let's see. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

35:41.286 --> 35:44.377
Ok, so Austin was the ringleader of
a particularly horrifying incident

35:44.377 --> 35:45.318
that happened a few years back.

35:45.318 --> 35:46.784
We need to know where it happened.

35:46.786 --> 35:49.153
It happened right there at the
basketball courts at school.

35:49.155 --> 35:50.288
This place is a maze.

35:50.290 --> 35:51.656
Garcia, can you guide us?

35:51.658 --> 35:52.824
Absolutely.

35:55.261 --> 35:56.961
Where are we going?

35:56.963 --> 35:59.664
We're going to the court.

35:59.666 --> 36:01.799
Come on, Kyle, you don't
want to go back there.

36:01.801 --> 36:03.568
Oh, shut up, Zach.

36:03.570 --> 36:05.403
You don't know what
the hell I want, man.

36:05.405 --> 36:08.573
I thought you did. I
thought you were my friend.

36:08.575 --> 36:12.477
But you are just like everybody else.

36:12.479 --> 36:15.113
I'm sorry, Kyle. I'm sorry.

36:15.115 --> 36:16.948
You will be.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.459
You're under arrest! Stand down!

36:28.461 --> 36:29.494
Stay back!

36:29.496 --> 36:31.596
I've got a gun. I'll use it.

36:31.598 --> 36:34.198
You do what you have to do.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.466
I'm ready.

36:36.469 --> 36:37.668
Shut up!

36:37.670 --> 36:39.103
Nobody's moving in, Kyle.

36:39.105 --> 36:41.606
Nobody's gonna shoot you.
You are not in danger.

36:41.608 --> 36:44.742
I know that I'm not getting out of here.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.979
I am ready.

36:47.981 --> 36:50.414
That's not how this has to go, Kyle.

36:50.416 --> 36:53.017
I know what happened here.

36:53.019 --> 36:55.119
I know what Austin did.

36:55.121 --> 36:56.754
You're a loser, Kyle.

36:59.058 --> 37:00.825
Are you ready?

37:00.827 --> 37:02.894
Yeah! Yeah!

37:02.896 --> 37:04.629
I said, are you ready?

37:04.631 --> 37:06.998
Yeah! Yeah!

37:08.201 --> 37:09.333
Here we go.

37:09.335 --> 37:11.402
Austin, please, please don't.

37:11.404 --> 37:13.842
- Go on, get him.
- What a loser.

37:14.874 --> 37:16.707
Yeah! Yeah!

37:16.709 --> 37:18.442
Let's do it again.

37:22.081 --> 37:23.714
Yeah!

37:31.491 --> 37:34.292
Get him, Austin!

37:56.185 --> 37:58.010
I know they left you out here all night,

37:58.010 --> 38:00.771
and you weren't found
until the next morning,

38:00.771 --> 38:04.338
and that nothing happened to
the people who did that to you.

38:04.472 --> 38:07.440
You don't care.

38:07.442 --> 38:08.975
Nobody cares.

38:08.977 --> 38:12.612
I do care, and I'm sorry.

38:12.614 --> 38:15.448
I'm sorry about what happened to you.

38:15.450 --> 38:18.484
But nothing ever changes.

38:18.486 --> 38:20.586
Mr. Bakken is a joke.

38:20.588 --> 38:24.323
Everything he does just
screws everything up.

38:24.325 --> 38:26.759
I know. You're right.

38:27.593 --> 38:31.064
Bakken failed you. Everybody failed you.

38:31.066 --> 38:33.332
And they made everything worse.

38:33.334 --> 38:35.902
But, Kyle, what you're doing now,

38:35.904 --> 38:38.638
this makes everything so much worse,

38:38.640 --> 38:41.674
and I know you don't want
to be responsible for that.

38:41.676 --> 38:44.844
I know you don't really
want to hurt your friends,

38:44.846 --> 38:50.216
the only ones who truly
understand what it's like.

38:50.218 --> 38:52.085
You're better than this.

38:52.087 --> 38:56.189
Kyle, please let me go.

39:21.549 --> 39:25.585
"Freedom is what you do with
what's been done to you."

39:25.587 --> 39:28.221
Jean-Paul Sartre.

39:33.027 --> 39:36.329
Heh. What's this?

39:36.331 --> 39:38.064
It's a present for Roxy.

39:38.066 --> 39:39.766
Are you gonna do this every day?

39:39.768 --> 39:42.368
Although I am generous to a fault,
every day would be beyond the pale,

39:42.370 --> 39:44.103
and I am nothing if not moderate.

39:44.105 --> 39:46.906
I was just thinking about how your Roxy

39:46.908 --> 39:48.407
probably saw some pretty intense stuff

39:48.409 --> 39:50.443
while you were with the Rangers,

39:50.445 --> 39:51.911
and maybe a pink
sweater isn't her thing.

39:51.913 --> 39:53.846
Not that pink isn't super bad-ass,

39:53.848 --> 39:57.150
just sweaters are restrictive
and this may be more her jam.

40:00.789 --> 40:04.290
Hey, this...

40:04.292 --> 40:05.558
This is dope.

40:05.560 --> 40:06.559
You like it?

40:06.561 --> 40:08.427
Yes. Thank you.

40:08.429 --> 40:09.862
Roxy thanks you.

40:09.864 --> 40:12.398
Oh, good. I knew I'd
eventually get it right.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.599
Feels good to get it right.

40:13.601 --> 40:14.934
I may not be able to prevent myself.

40:14.936 --> 40:16.235
From random acts of dog kindness.

40:16.237 --> 40:18.905
Not every day, mind you,
because that would be excessive.

40:18.907 --> 40:21.340
Oh, yeah. And you're
the queen of moderation.

40:21.342 --> 40:23.276
I am the Queen of it.

40:23.278 --> 40:25.611
We're heading to O'Keefe's
for a drink. You in?

40:25.613 --> 40:28.614
Oh, hell, yes. I'm ready to
call ahead for my margarita.

40:28.616 --> 40:30.116
Luke, you joining us today?

40:30.118 --> 40:34.487
No. This one doesn't do the
whole bonding over drinks thing.

40:34.489 --> 40:35.922
I'm in.

40:35.924 --> 40:39.625
What? Oh, you're not fooling me, Alvez.

40:39.627 --> 40:42.528
He just wants us to think
he's a smoldering basket

40:42.530 --> 40:44.964
of mystique and contradictions.

40:44.966 --> 40:46.098
I don't buy it.

40:46.100 --> 40:48.034
Hey, I just want a beer.

40:48.036 --> 40:53.036
Well, there may be a
glimmer of hope for you yet.

40:53.036 --> 40:55.975
But just so you know, the new guy pays.
