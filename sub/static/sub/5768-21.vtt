WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.462
(organ music plays)

00:09.370 --> 00:11.702
Did you know him?

00:11.740 --> 00:14.732
No, I thought you did.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.372
Have you noticed
the older Mom gets,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.115
the younger
her friends become?

00:23.150 --> 00:25.038
Where do you think
she is anyway?

00:25.090 --> 00:28.253
My bet, she got us here
a half hour early

00:28.290 --> 00:30.451
so we wouldn't be
a half hour late.

00:30.490 --> 00:33.550
I hate it
when she does that.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.750
You're missing the point.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.062
I love...

00:37.100 --> 00:38.465
Peter.
You don't love Peter.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.535
Stop saying that.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.390
He's changed,
he's not the same.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.407
Oh, my God.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.464
You are one
of those Oprah women.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.831
I'm gonna take you out back
and give you a spanking.

00:45.870 --> 00:48.338
He slept with prostitutes--
that doesn't change.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.372
Why do you and Mom keep
pushing me toward Will?

00:51.410 --> 00:53.617
The same reason you
just brought him up-- hmm?

00:53.650 --> 00:56.585
You're tempted.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.417
It's not a good thing.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.088
Your body is
telling you something.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.758
Oh, my God, stop it.

01:01.790 --> 01:02.779
Is that what you tell

01:02.830 --> 01:04.183
your students in
advanced algebra?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.254
Statistical modeling.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.325
Your body is telling
you something?

01:06.360 --> 01:08.692
Did you kiss him
or did Will kiss you?

01:08.730 --> 01:10.766
Both.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.859
Mm, I love it
when that happens.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.231
It was a mistake.

01:14.270 --> 01:17.137
What happened
last time with him?

01:17.170 --> 01:18.398
Why'd you break it off?

01:18.440 --> 01:21.477
It didn't seem like it
was a long-term thing.

01:21.510 --> 01:24.604
Okay, do you see

01:24.650 --> 01:26.117
how insane that is?

01:26.150 --> 01:27.219
_You were worried
It wasn't gonna be

01:27.250 --> 01:29.582
a long-term thing so you
cut it off before it could be

01:29.620 --> 01:31.247
(Veronica laughs)
a long-term thing.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.417
Uh-oh, there's Mom. Owen?

01:33.460 --> 01:34.313
Don't say a word.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.884
There you are, you two.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.421
Hi, Mom.
Hi.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.496
I've been looking
for you everywhere.
Mom.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.498
Everybody's in there--
what are you doing in here?

01:41.530 --> 01:43.327
We don't know anyone.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.361
Of course you don't-- that's
why I have to introduce you.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.197
So, how do you know him?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.468
The deceased.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.637
Oh, I don't--
I never met him.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.365
No, no, it's Charlene, the wife.

01:51.410 --> 01:52.832
You know, she's Malcolm's niece.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.529
She's a sweet one _
and she's got a great haircut.

01:54.580 --> 01:55.706
Come on, you'll see.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.673
(whispering):
She's got a great haircut.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.611
Ms. Peterson,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.789
Thank you.
And you're...?

02:03.820 --> 02:05.447
Owen, Veronica's son.

02:05.490 --> 02:06.411
He's the mathematician.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.586
This is the lawyer,

02:07.620 --> 02:09.485
Alicia.
I'm so sorry, Ms. Peterson.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.485
Thank you for coming.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.351
And thank you so much
for offering to do this.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.493
You're welcome.

02:15.530 --> 02:16.497
We didn't know
who to call.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.758
Eugene, this is
the lavwer.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.496
Hi.
Hello.

02:20.540 --> 02:21.768
Will you excuse me?
Eugene works there, too.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.768
And... thank you
so much again.

02:23.810 --> 02:27.234
We're incredibly grateful
for your help.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.633
What's this about, Mom?

02:28.680 --> 02:31.205
You're so generous
with your time,

02:31.250 --> 02:32.478
Alicia.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.408
Thank you so much,
Mrs. Florrick.

02:34.450 --> 02:37.419
It-it was just such a surprise
to be given a 48-hour deadline.

02:37.450 --> 02:40.487
I'm... sorry.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.817
Uh, what are we...?

02:41.860 --> 02:43.828
Could you tell me
what we're talking about?

02:43.860 --> 02:45.350
Oh, uh, yes.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.490
the software developer.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.521
Charlene, Frank, myself...

02:50.570 --> 02:51.696
Frank?

02:51.730 --> 02:53.891
The deceased?

02:53.940 --> 02:55.532
I'm sorry, yes.

02:55.570 --> 02:58.437
We've had 18-hour shifts
this week to get done

02:58.470 --> 03:00.677
some new software,
and Frank was driving home

03:00.710 --> 03:03.474
for Charlene's birthday
and he fell asleep at the wheel.

03:03.510 --> 03:04.670
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.543
Thank you. So that's why this
contract rankles so much.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.946
It doesn't protect us
on overtime or number of hours,

03:09.990 --> 03:12.709
and it says we also
can't file suit.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.456
I think they're worried
about Charlene suing...

03:15.490 --> 03:17.651
Should they sign it or not--
that's what they want to know.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.268
Well...

03:22.300 --> 03:24.791
I can pull up some
comparable contracts,

03:24.830 --> 03:26.491
but I really shouldn't
be advising...

03:26.540 --> 03:27.495
Whatever you can do.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.666
Thank you.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.759
Thank you.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.779
It's too bad nobody
needs free math work.

03:34.810 --> 03:36.778
PETER:
Okay.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.278
Let's try not to kill anyone
in the transition.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.742
(all chuckling)

03:40.780 --> 03:42.008
Oops.

03:42.050 --> 03:45.679
Looks like I have a meeting with
a very severe-looking pollster.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.948
So I'm gonna
thank you, gentlemen,

03:46.990 --> 03:48.457
and say good-bye.

03:48.490 --> 03:49.627
Hey, Matt.

03:49.660 --> 03:50.558
Hello, sir.
How are you?

03:50.590 --> 03:51.557
Good, it's been a while.

03:51.590 --> 03:54.696
How was D.C.?
Awful.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.528
(laughs)
Uh, will you let me know
when my wife is free.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.969
Thank you.
Sit, sit, sit.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.560
I want to thank you
for looking over our polling.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.568
You know, I get
worried that, uh,

04:03.610 --> 04:06.875
our internals are being overly
optimistic about our numbers,

04:06.910 --> 04:08.730
and I just don't want to get
caught with my pants down.

04:08.780 --> 04:09.906
You know what I mean?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.770
I do know.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.311
Okay, well, that was...
(laughs)

04:16.350 --> 04:18.341
that was a very
freighted pause.

04:18.390 --> 04:21.757
Your internals _
are overly optimistic.

04:23.090 --> 04:26.025
Our pollsters have us leading
Kresteva by five points.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.493
Do you think that's wrong?
Yes.

04:27.530 --> 04:29.794
Where do you think we're at?

04:29.830 --> 04:32.731
Down by two points.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.435
I'm losing?
Yes.

04:37.470 --> 04:40.439
Can somebody... anybody...
get me Eli.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.040
I believe Harbot Welch _
oversampled the African American

04:43.080 --> 04:44.843
and youth vote.
The vote is in two weeks

04:44.880 --> 04:45.972
and I'm losing?

04:46.010 --> 04:48.410
Yes, now if you could increase

04:48.450 --> 04:50.418
Kresteva's negatives with women,
you'd be very competitive.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.418
I attack Kresteva
my own negatives go up.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.381
Yes.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.388
But not your wife's.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.559
I mean, you're not hurt

04:57.590 --> 04:59.990
if your wife does the
attacking for you.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.329
No.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.395
It's the only way...
I'm sorry.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.397
I can't do that.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.863
Thank you.
One, one minute.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.401
Eli, where are you?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.907
In Alicia's office.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.430
Oh.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.538
Honey, I'm sorry.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.501
How are you?

05:15.540 --> 05:17.576
I'm good, how are you?

05:17.610 --> 05:18.770
(Peter sighs)

05:18.810 --> 05:19.879
Peter?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.672
Are you okay?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.540
Listen, would you have dinner
with me tonight?

05:23.590 --> 05:25.546
Sure, why?

05:25.590 --> 05:27.512
Just a thank you for the Charlie
Rose interview on Thursday.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.686
You don't have to thank me.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.028
I know I don't have
to thank you.

05:30.060 --> 05:32.051
I want to thank you, so...

05:32.090 --> 05:32.897
how about it?

05:32.930 --> 05:36.764
8:00 downtown
in my campaign bus.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.665
Okay, I'll see you then.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.668
Hi.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.009
I like that rug.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.462
My mom has one
just like it.

05:45.510 --> 05:46.829
Thank you.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.576
Nancy Crozier,
what can I do for you?

05:49.610 --> 05:52.408
Actually I'm here to do
something for you.

05:52.450 --> 05:55.044
We're offering a two percent
increase to the top 20.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.411
But that's it.

05:56.450 --> 05:57.747
I...

05:57.790 --> 06:00.384
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.729
Mr. Jenlowe is within his
rights to fire them.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.398
He doesn't want to,
but he runs a business.

06:06.430 --> 06:08.398
We think two
percent's very fair.
Nancy,

06:08.430 --> 06:09.795
seriously, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:09.830 --> 06:12.162
Blowtorch.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.590
We were told you were the lawyer
consulting with the employees.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.403
We just want them to
sign their contracts.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.759
Good, I'll let them know.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.675
And delaying's not gonna work.

06:20.710 --> 06:22.644
We're in earnest.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.999
"Earnest."

06:24.050 --> 06:25.403
Good, got it.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.348
I like you, Alicia.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.041
I don't want to see
you make a mistake.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.756
I'm not sure what mistake
I might make,

06:32.790 --> 06:34.781
but I am glad you like me.

06:36.690 --> 06:39.022
I don't like sarcasm.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.527
It's cheap.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.925
Okay, thank you, Nancy.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.962
We will be in touch.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.194
We don't do management labor.
This is not a hard
and fast rule.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.835
And if we did, it wouldn't be
this piddly-squeak coder stuff.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.963
DIANE:
Excuse me, Alicia,
this case you brought in,

06:50.010 --> 06:51.432
this Blowtorch case?

06:51.470 --> 06:53.574
We received a cease
and de5ist order

06:53.610 --> 06:54.929
from Blowtorch.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.540
Now, you don't have
to tell us when you take

06:57.580 --> 06:58.740
in a new client--
you're a partner now--

06:58.780 --> 07:01.647
but when it infringes
on territory

07:01.680 --> 07:02.647
occupied by Chumhum...

07:02.690 --> 07:04.544
Okay, look, I'm sorry

07:04.590 --> 07:05.682
this has become a thing.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.881
They are not my new clients.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.854
This is just a really
simple favor for my mom.

07:09.890 --> 07:11.050
For Veronica?

07:11.090 --> 07:13.149
How's she doing?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.553
Uh... good.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.056
Good, tell her...

07:16.100 --> 07:17.795
"hi" from me.

07:19.670 --> 07:20.932
I will.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.063
Uh, all I'm doing
for these employees is

07:23.110 --> 07:24.600
finding comps for
their contract.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.528
That's all.
They think you're the lawyer.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.831
I know, I know.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.177
I will get this
off my desk fast.

07:29.210 --> 07:31.474
It's just management labor
can be a bit tricky.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.546
Don't worry.
This will be fast.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.116
But the galling thing
is the maternity leave.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.515
There's none.
(chuckles)

07:36.550 --> 07:37.710
90% of these other
contracts have

07:37.750 --> 07:38.842
at least one month maternity.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.551
So suggest a month?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.683
Suggest two and they'll
reduce it to one.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.654
At the state's attorney office,
I negotiated down from three.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.658
Anything else?
O.T.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.497
for any work week
exceeding 60 hours.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.919
And some kind of criteria for
performance-based bonuses.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.699
Great. Thanks, Cary.
Sure.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.834
Lorna, can you get me
these in triplicate?

07:58.610 --> 07:59.872
Do any of you get overtime

07:59.910 --> 08:03.573
if your work week
exceeds 60 hours?

08:03.610 --> 08:05.544
Do you?
No.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.013
I just came from a meeting
with Cary and Alicia

08:07.050 --> 08:08.017
and they were arguing

08:08.050 --> 08:10.041
it was unfair not to.

08:11.990 --> 08:12.649
CARY:
As you can see

08:12.690 --> 08:14.681
from these other
four contracts

08:14.720 --> 08:17.553
from comparable work places
with comparable salaries...

08:18.730 --> 08:20.698
Charlene, you don't need
to be here.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.789
It's okay, I want to be.

08:22.830 --> 08:26.027
Mrs. Peterson,
we're very sorry for your loss.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.992
CARY:
As you can see

08:28.040 --> 08:29.769
from these other four contracts,
we need criteria

08:29.810 --> 08:31.004
for just-cause termination.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.100
Yes, except none of those other
contracts were for coders.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.576
They cover contract workers,
the same as Blowtorch's coders.

08:37.610 --> 08:39.749
Eugene? Charlene?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.645
Do you consider
yourselves equivalent

08:41.680 --> 08:44.217
to shop workers,
pipe layers, and...

08:44.250 --> 08:46.810
janitorial service personnel?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.680
Aren't you more
like artists?

08:48.720 --> 08:50.654
Entrepreneurs?
Why don't we focus on

08:50.690 --> 08:51.952
contractual language?
These lawyers

08:51.990 --> 08:54.720
want to talk in
dollars and cents.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.057
But that's not

08:56.100 --> 08:57.226
what your work is about.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.067
It's about... magic.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.739
It's about genius.

09:01.770 --> 09:02.862
Then why don't you pay them
like geniuses?

09:02.910 --> 09:04.866
"Them"?

09:04.910 --> 09:08.038
Wh... Who exactly is "them"?

09:08.080 --> 09:09.672
20 Blowtorch employees.

09:09.710 --> 09:10.802
They've signed on.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.306
CARY:
So again, if we could now

09:12.350 --> 09:14.671
turn to maternity leave,
you'll see it as the third...

09:14.720 --> 09:16.688
I'm sorry, I don't think
we need to go any further.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.812
Um, these are
letters of dismissal.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.784
Blowtorch thanks you

09:19.820 --> 09:21.151
for your many years
of dedicated service.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.055
Wait. Excuse me.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.955
And we wish you the best
in future endeavors.

09:24.990 --> 09:26.594
This is not the way
to handle this.

09:26.630 --> 09:27.949
Yes, but it's the way we're
choosing to handle it.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.955
Your desks have
been cleared,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.093
and your belongings have
been messengered home.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.290
You are really amazing,
you know that?

09:32.330 --> 09:34.662
I do know that.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.837
We're looking for artists,

09:35.870 --> 09:37.360
not employees.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.105
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
I'll sign it.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.300
I'll sign the contract.
Eugene, no.

09:40.340 --> 09:41.773
CROZIER:
I'm afraid it's too late.

09:41.810 --> 09:42.572
We're worried that your attitude

09:42.610 --> 09:45.078
will infect our
other... artists.

09:45.110 --> 09:46.771
Thank you.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.014
PETER:
It's gonna cost us votes.

09:48.050 --> 09:49.642
Now, we talk about
this all the time,

09:49.690 --> 09:50.884
let's just put
it to bed.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.808
(door opens)

09:53.860 --> 09:54.781
(door closes)

09:54.820 --> 09:55.980
Well, sounds like we're both

09:56.020 --> 09:57.658
having a bad day.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.157
(sighs):
Yeah. What's yours about?

09:59.190 --> 10:01.090
I just got 20 people fired.

10:01.130 --> 10:03.121
How about you?

10:03.170 --> 10:05.866
They want me to go
negative on Kresteva.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.731
Point out his sexism.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.192
Not when you're up
by five points.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.943
Everything all right?

10:16.980 --> 10:18.299
Yeah.

10:19.780 --> 10:20.940
How's
you
r pizza?

10:20.980 --> 10:22.174
Hmm.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.017
It's our first date pizza.

10:24.050 --> 10:25.881
And wine out of the bottle.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.059
(chuckles)

10:28.090 --> 10:29.887
Well, almost like

10:29.930 --> 10:31.750
our first date.
Almost.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.792
(chuckles)

10:36.730 --> 10:37.890
What's that, Peter?

10:37.930 --> 10:40.763
That is a ring.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.358
But I already have one.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.936
Mm-hmm.

10:43.970 --> 10:45.767
In two weeks, I'm gonna know

10:45.810 --> 10:48.677
whether I'm in office or not.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.302
Either way, I have a week off.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.375
I want you to come with me

10:52.410 --> 10:53.809
to Hawaii and renew our vows.

10:53.850 --> 10:56.068
(sighs)
Peter.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.213
Just consider it.

11:04.390 --> 11:05.926
I don't know.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.849
Why?

11:08.900 --> 11:10.720
Because things are good
right now,

11:10.770 --> 11:12.795
but that doesn't mean
they'll stay that way.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.967
It doesn't mean they won't.
No.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.707
They never do.

11:19.810 --> 11:24.144
Well, all I know is that...

11:24.180 --> 11:25.977
I love you.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.012
Say yes.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.068
You're at-will employees. The
company can terminate you

11:47.100 --> 11:48.761
for any nondiscriminatory
reason.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.937
(all exclaiming)

11:49.970 --> 11:51.938
Now, everyone, wait, wait.
Listen, listen.

11:51.970 --> 11:54.973
There is a safe harbor here.
You can't be fired

11:55.010 --> 11:57.274
if you say you were trying
to form a union.

11:57.310 --> 11:58.470
Working together in order

11:58.510 --> 12:00.842
to collectively bargain
is considered PCA:

12:00.880 --> 12:02.848
"protected
concerted activity."

12:02.890 --> 12:04.448
You want us to form a union?

12:04.490 --> 12:05.946
We're not teamsters.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.878
No, we want you to keep
from being fired by saying

12:07.920 --> 12:09.251
you were forming a union.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.451
They can't fire you
if you say that.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.151
Really?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.452
Y-Yes.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.264
CARY: We'll file a complaint
with the NLRB, asking them

12:18.300 --> 12:20.188
to enjoin Blowtorch
from firing you.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.094
Then you just drag out
the process of unionizing.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.164
The whole point
is to delay.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.461
They'll eventually fire us.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.159
ALICIA: No. Delay and
you'll get leverage.

12:26.210 --> 12:29.407
It'll keep them from hiring
replacement workers.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.499
(group murmuring)

12:31.550 --> 12:33.518
I think it's a good idea.

12:33.550 --> 12:37.839
Shake the trees
at OSHA, EEOC and EBSA.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.346
What am I looking for?

12:39.390 --> 12:41.881
Any complaints by Blowtorch
employees alleging

12:41.920 --> 12:43.353
an unfair or unsafe workplace.

12:43.390 --> 12:46.257
It'll make it easier to argue
that they were unionizing.

12:46.290 --> 12:48.292
Organizing?
Why should we do that?

12:48.330 --> 12:50.025
Because we're underpaid
and overworked.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.220
And we'll be out of work
if we rock the boat.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.339
Margie?
Hmm?

12:53.370 --> 12:54.439
I thought you were gonna
get me lunch.

12:54.470 --> 12:56.131
I-I'm on my way.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.331
The way is this way,
not that way.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.302
Hello, everyone,

13:06.350 --> 13:08.341
and thank you for joining us

13:08.380 --> 13:11.349
at the Chicago National
Labor Relations Board.

13:11.390 --> 13:14.314
I'm Administrative Law Judge
Rodney Jesko.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.487
"Rodney" is fine.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.987
Or even "Rod."

13:18.030 --> 13:20.225
Rod, Nancy Crozier
for the respondent, Blowtorch.

13:20.260 --> 13:23.024
And I'm sorry,
but I'm very new to NLRB,

13:23.070 --> 13:25.197
so if you could just let me know

13:25.230 --> 13:28.495
when it's my turn
to say my piece?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.201
There's no need to apologize.
I'm a new judge

13:30.240 --> 13:32.208
here myself.
Just promoted.
Really?

13:32.240 --> 13:35.573
Happened a few years later
than I thought it would,

13:35.610 --> 13:39.376
but, uh... that's politics.
(chuckles)

13:39.410 --> 13:41.344
Your Honor-- I mean, Rod--

13:41.380 --> 13:45.282
we have affidavits from
18 recently dismissed employees

13:45.320 --> 13:48.255
attesting to protected
concerted activity
under the NLRA.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.258
Wow. 18?
(chuckles)

13:50.290 --> 13:51.222
Ms. Crozier?

13:51.260 --> 13:52.557
I'm sorry.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.126
"Nancy."

13:54.160 --> 13:56.355
I tend to just blurt things out
when I'm amazed.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.890
I do the same thing.

13:57.930 --> 14:00.239
My friends are
always trying to stop me.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.465
Rod, we ask
that you enjoin Blowtorch

14:02.500 --> 14:04.309
from firing any employees
until such time

14:04.340 --> 14:06.228
as we can prepare
a case for unionizing.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.272
Yes, but, Rod, each day

14:08.310 --> 14:10.278
that this labor dispute
is dragged on

14:10.310 --> 14:12.403
is a day that my client
gets closer to bankruptcy.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.418
How is a handful of
terminated employees

14:14.450 --> 14:16.270
trying to get
their jobs back going

14:16.320 --> 14:17.412
to mean her client's
finanCIal rum?

14:17.450 --> 14:20.283
Sorry, I thought these would be
more polite proceedings.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.184
Uh, yes.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.381
So let's please try
to watch our tone.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.352
_ Blowtorch's financial
Situation is very precarious

14:25.390 --> 14:27.597
with resourcesdiverted
to protracted litigation.

14:27.630 --> 14:30.428
All right, well,
then I see no problem

14:30.470 --> 14:31.960
with questioning these witnesses
right now

14:32.000 --> 14:33.433
about their
organizmg efforts.

14:33.470 --> 14:35.358
Your Honor, we came here
merely expecting

14:35.400 --> 14:37.129
to lay the groundwork
for our defense.

14:37.170 --> 14:39.161
Ah, but wasn't it Oliver Wendell
Holmes who said,

14:39.210 --> 14:43.044
"Speed is a thing that is...

14:43.080 --> 14:46.345
mightily... to be wished"?

14:46.380 --> 14:48.644
Can we question
your first witness?

14:52.590 --> 14:56.515
What am I supposed to say?
I can't lie.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.449
We don't want you
to lie.

14:59.490 --> 15:03.028
We want you to tell
the helpful truth.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.663
Les Neukirk from the
Department of Labor.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.008
And you're looking
for information

15:10.040 --> 15:11.132
on Blowtorch Industries?

15:11.170 --> 15:13.434
Yes. Workplace complaints.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.368
Why don't you ask the employees
you're representing?

15:15.410 --> 15:18.049
Well, we don't represent
all the employees.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.947
Oh. Um...

15:20.980 --> 15:24.518
we have no outstanding
complaints against Blowtorch.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.619
What about past complaints?

15:25.650 --> 15:29.984
Just one in the last 18 months,
recently withdrawn.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.090
So, how long have you been
at Lockhart/Gardner?

15:33.130 --> 15:35.155
Me? Uh, a little over a month.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.088
Any workplace issues?

15:37.130 --> 15:38.722
No.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.499
Very happy, thank you.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.259
Because some people contact me
as a cover

15:43.310 --> 15:45.437
for other issues:
pay, benefits.

15:45.470 --> 15:47.438
No, good benefits, health care.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.209
Everything's good.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.343
And you?

15:50.380 --> 15:51.608
Happy as a clam.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.242
Oh.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.474
Well, thank you.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.112
Sometimes firms
grow so fast,

15:56.150 --> 15:59.449
issues of wage and hour
compliance get overlooked.

15:59.490 --> 16:02.414
No one has to know
that you talked to me.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.466
You get health care?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.491
Excuse me.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.361
Are you from
the Department of Labor?
Yes.

16:18.410 --> 16:20.002
Do you need something?

16:20.040 --> 16:21.530
Just some advice.

16:21.580 --> 16:25.107
Do you have someplace
we can talk?

16:25.150 --> 16:29.268
Frank's not even dead
24 hours, and we get hit

16:29.320 --> 16:30.719
with this contract.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.184
People were outraged.
It felt punitive.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.710
And did you discuss
collectively taking action

16:34.760 --> 16:36.250
in response
to these contract demands?

16:36.290 --> 16:40.021
Sorry to interrupt,
but objection.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.049
Calls for legal
conclusion.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.124
Indeed it does. Sustained.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.721
Did you collectively voice
outrage to your boss?

16:45.770 --> 16:49.035
At that stage, no.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.503
But you did

16:50.540 --> 16:53.134
discuss getting together
to have your views known

16:53.180 --> 16:54.807
to someone in a supervisory
capacity, right?

16:54.840 --> 16:55.807
Not...

16:55.840 --> 16:58.741
I mean,
in terms of...

16:58.780 --> 17:02.045
See, we were fired before we
could formulate a specific plan.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.719
But you had time to get in
touch with me before

17:04.750 --> 17:06.411
you were terminated,
right?
Yes.

17:06.450 --> 17:08.315
We collectively got in touch
with you

17:08.360 --> 17:09.588
at Frank Peterson's
funeral.

17:09.620 --> 17:10.826
And what exactly did we discuss?

17:10.860 --> 17:13.727
How we could engage in

17:13.760 --> 17:14.727
protected
concerted activity

17:14.760 --> 17:15.829
to safeguard
our rights.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.498
I'm sorry,
but the witness is obviously

17:17.530 --> 17:20.260
regurgitating terminology
he's been fed by counsel.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.530
I mean, objection.

17:22.570 --> 17:23.707
(chuckles)
Sustained.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.560
When we met at the funeral,

17:25.610 --> 17:28.170
did we discuss potentially
starting a union

17:28.210 --> 17:30.747
to address
your contract concerns?

17:30.780 --> 17:31.701
Potentially, yes.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.378
We discussed
the potentiality.
Thank you.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.512
Nothing further.

17:35.550 --> 17:36.619
Nancy, anything?

17:36.650 --> 17:38.345
Yes. We have
one rebuttal Witness--

17:38.390 --> 17:42.383
Charlene Peterson.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.729
PETER:
Thanks for doing this, Owen.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.797
I know we've never
been very close.

17:47.830 --> 17:50.128
Well, like I said,

17:50.170 --> 17:52.229
statistical sampling isn't
really my area of expertise.

17:52.270 --> 17:55.091
I'm just looking for an opinion
from someone I'm not paying.

17:55.140 --> 18:00.305
The thing is it looks
pretty good, but I can't,

18:00.340 --> 18:02.171
I can't really tell.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.201
I have a speech
in a few minutes.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.571
Oh. I'll let you go then.

18:06.610 --> 18:08.111
No, no, no,
go ahead, stay.

18:08.150 --> 18:12.143
(sighs)

18:12.190 --> 18:13.885
Did you and Alicia talk?

18:13.920 --> 18:16.582
Did we talk? Yes.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.327
About me?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.328
About, um, about
personal things.

18:23.430 --> 18:26.319
I've asked Alicia to recommit
to our marriage.

18:26.370 --> 18:28.895
I know you talk with her,

18:28.940 --> 18:31.636
I know that you and I
have had our differences.

18:31.670 --> 18:37.142
But I'm-I'm really intent
on showing you

18:37.180 --> 18:40.308
that I want to forget
those differences.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.443
_ Peter... this
isn't a campaign.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.811
This is life.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.886
(chuckles)
You think I'm campaigning?

18:45.920 --> 18:51.187
Yeah, I read somewhere that the
surest way for a politician

18:51.230 --> 18:53.528
to get you to love him
is to ask for something.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.152
You'd think it'd be
the opposite:

18:55.200 --> 18:56.519
to give you something.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.791
But, no, voters count
themselves so cheap,

18:59.830 --> 19:02.162
you just have to
ask me a favor.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.838
I asked you here
because I want things

19:03.870 --> 19:05.406
to be better between us.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.431
So I'd put in a good word
for you with Alicia?

19:09.810 --> 19:11.243
Yes.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.114
I'd better go.

19:15.150 --> 19:18.847
And, uh, you gotta
get to that speech.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.228
She said if we wanted
to keep our jobs,

19:30.270 --> 19:31.521
forming a union
was the only way.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.299
Mrs. Florrick said that?
I'm going to object

19:33.340 --> 19:34.830
on the grounds of
attorney-client privilege.

19:34.870 --> 19:36.758
The client can waive
that prIVIlege.

19:38.370 --> 19:39.928
She's effectively waiving it
on their behalf, too.

19:39.970 --> 19:43.599
Mm, interesting quandary.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.641
How to split that baby?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.546
By not.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.957
I think I shall side
with more inclusiveness.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.958
You may answer the
question, Ms. Peterson.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.527
Yes. Mrs. Florrick
said that.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.926
And before Mrs. Florrick
advised you to form a union,

20:00.960 --> 20:02.894
had you or any
of your fellow coders

20:02.930 --> 20:04.363
expressed any interest
in doing so?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.322
We did not.
ALICIA:
Lorna,

20:06.370 --> 20:08.793
can you get me the Department
of Labor on the phone?

20:08.840 --> 20:09.989
Diane and Will
asked for you.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.668
They... Now?
Yes.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.871
Could you close the door?

20:18.580 --> 20:21.879
We have an insurrection on our
hands, AliCia. Because of you.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.718
WILL: The assistants
are asking for a raise.
DAVID: They're inspired

20:24.750 --> 20:25.944
by this case
that isn't a case.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.014
DIANE:
We thought you
were giving it up.

20:27.050 --> 20:28.381
Yes, the difficulty is

20:28.420 --> 20:29.853
the employer threatened
to fire them,

20:29.890 --> 20:30.788
so we felt obligated.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.718
You broke it, you own it?
Unfortunately.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.250
We're at the NLRB right now.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.528
DAVID:
They're not gonna
get another cent.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.289
These damned assistants.

20:37.330 --> 20:38.399
They think
we need them.

20:38.430 --> 20:39.192
The assistants are asking

20:39.230 --> 20:40.595
that_we listen
to their proposal.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.664
How many assistants?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.258
Eight. Why?
Well,

20:44.310 --> 20:46.301
they need a third
to get a vote on unionizing.

20:46.340 --> 20:47.102
That's not enough.
DAVID:
They know.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.778
You had
a Department of Labor guy

20:48.810 --> 20:51.404
out who educated them.
Well, then we need
to talk to them.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.418
We need to fire 'em before...
WILL:
David, Alicia,

20:53.450 --> 20:55.839
you meet with the assistants
before they organize.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.541
Hear their demands.
And then what?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.319
Hear their demands.

20:59.350 --> 21:02.285
We don't have the money for
across-the-board raises.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.959
We do if we _don't take
increases this quarter.

21:04.990 --> 21:08.448
We do if you don't take
any salary this year.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.593
DIANE:
The difficulty,
Alicia, is

21:10.630 --> 21:12.325
we can't afford the precedent.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.296
Nothing from
the Department of Labor?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.693
No, no complaints.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.300
Charlene really
testified against you?

21:19.340 --> 21:21.399
I think Blowtorch
has her back in their ranks.
What do you think,

21:21.440 --> 21:22.702
a payoff?
Probably.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.049
We need some way
to prove it though.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.445
I'll go talk
to her coworkers.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.412
Cary, did you know
that Robyn has health care?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.758
No, I didn't.

21:37.790 --> 21:40.350
Do you know how
much she earns?
Um...

21:40.400 --> 21:42.789
No, how much?
I don't know.

21:42.830 --> 21:45.367
Are you feeling jealous?

21:45.400 --> 21:46.662
Do you want to know why
the widow is testifying

21:46.700 --> 21:47.894
for Blowtorch?

21:48.940 --> 21:50.908
Yes, I do.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.737
Then ask Robyn
'cause she gets health care.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.771
Kalinda.
Yeah.

22:00.450 --> 22:02.441
(quietly):
The fourth years
are starting our own firm.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.085
We're taking five
top clients with us.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.587
VVho?
I'm not gonna say.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.611
I want you to come with us.

22:10.390 --> 22:11.459
Sure.

22:11.490 --> 22:13.082
Exclusively.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.655
No way.
They don't
value you here.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.568
We'll value you.
You'll have your own office.
I don't want my own office.

22:19.600 --> 22:23.058
You'll be paid more.
Okay. Then you come up
with an offer,

22:23.100 --> 22:24.738
and I'll listen.
No.

22:24.770 --> 22:28.001
You'll just use that to get up
Lockhart/Gardner's offer.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.077
(laughs softly)
We need three months
to get our ducks in order.

22:32.980 --> 22:37.485
Okay, then come up
with an offer when
you get your... ducks.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.853
Oh, by the way, the man from
the Department of Labor said

22:40.890 --> 22:43.154
that somebody recently
withdrew their complaint

22:43.190 --> 22:45.021
against Blowtorch.

22:45.060 --> 22:46.687
I would look there.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.596
So you filed a complaint
about the hazardous
working conditions

22:51.630 --> 22:54.463
at Blowtorch immediately
following your husband's death?
Yes.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.491
But then you withdrew
that complaint within 24 hours?

22:57.540 --> 22:59.701
Yes.
Ms. Peterson,

22:59.740 --> 23:00.707
were you offered an inducement

23:00.740 --> 23:02.139
by the company
to withdraw that complaint...

23:02.180 --> 23:03.647
Objection, Rod.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.103
I'm sorry, but this
young woman has just lost

23:06.150 --> 23:08.414
her husband, and this
is clearly badgering.
ROD: Oh, I don't know.

23:08.450 --> 23:10.486
Doesn't really sound
like badgering to me, Nancy.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.613
You can answer
the question.
CHARLENE:
They settled.

23:12.650 --> 23:13.878
I was going to sue,

23:13.920 --> 23:15.456
but they settled.
ALICIA:
Rod,

23:15.490 --> 23:17.117
we believe this proves our case.
Does not.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.458
Actually, Nancy,
I'm afraid it does.
I find that

23:19.490 --> 23:22.789
the coders at Blowtorch
were attempting to engage

23:22.830 --> 23:24.422
in a protected,
concerted activity

23:24.470 --> 23:26.426
prior to being fired.
I therefore order

23:26.470 --> 23:27.892
that they be reinstated.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.965
CROZIER:
But they still need
to vote to form a union

23:30.000 --> 23:31.103
in order to retain
that protection.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.131
Otherwise, Blowtorch has
an absolute right to fire them.

23:33.170 --> 23:35.638
Yes, that is absolutely true.
CARY:
Only if the union

23:35.680 --> 23:37.136
is not certified before
the court-imposed deadline.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.807
And that is absolutely true.

23:38.850 --> 23:39.874
CROZIER:
Therefore we would ask for

23:39.910 --> 23:40.945
an expedited deadline
of 24 hours.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.948
ALICIA:
What?! She can't ask

23:42.980 --> 23:44.743
for 24 yours.
Hold on, hold on,
hold on. Compromise.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.884
Compromise is
the cornerstone of any...

23:47.920 --> 23:49.956
well, of any building.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.958
So I have made a decision.

23:51.990 --> 23:53.651
The workers are going
to get their injunction,

23:53.700 --> 23:55.224
and the company's going to
get their 24-hour deadline.

23:55.260 --> 23:57.899
But, Rod, 24 hours...
24 hours is not...

23:57.930 --> 24:00.637
Listen, Alicia, if your clients
were really organizing,

24:00.670 --> 24:02.490
they should be ready

24:02.540 --> 24:05.532
(bangs gavel)
and able to get this vote
together in 24 hours.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.468
Jenny, I don't understand
how half this memo

24:10.510 --> 24:12.705
could be misspelled--
just run it through
a spell-check.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.111
That's okay, Jenny.

24:20.150 --> 24:21.708
Hi.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.182
Come in.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.182
You taking over?

24:26.230 --> 24:27.993
Couldn't do worse.
You already got

24:28.030 --> 24:28.849
a five percent raise, Kalinda.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.492
We're not talking
about money again

24:30.530 --> 24:31.724
this year.
I'm being pursued.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.169
My God, that's awful.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.192
Did you talk to the police?
And I'm considering
taking the offer.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.037
Yes, and every time
you try this gambit,

24:38.070 --> 24:39.867
it's just
a little less effective.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.002
Who's pursuing you?

24:41.040 --> 24:43.008
New firm.
Which new firm.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.679
Robyn gets health care.

24:45.710 --> 24:47.769
(sighs quietly)
Hmm.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.515
Do you want health care?

24:49.550 --> 24:51.745
Well, health care's
equivalent to...

24:51.790 --> 24:55.817
$30,000 a year--
that puts her pretty
close to my salary.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.919
She told you her salary?
No. I can guess.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.655
She's been here
five weeks, Will.

24:59.690 --> 25:00.759
I've been here five years.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.598
Kalinda, health care
requires exclusivity, and you

25:03.630 --> 25:05.029
want your freedom.
I want my value.

25:05.070 --> 25:07.789
Why is everybody talking
about money all of a sudden?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.193
What happened to being a family?

25:09.240 --> 25:13.529
Doing things because we're
dedicated to each other.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.730
(laughs)

25:16.940 --> 25:19.602
Look, you consider
being exclusive to us,

25:19.650 --> 25:21.868
and I'll get you more money.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.013
But otherwise, your freedom...

25:24.050 --> 25:26.018
costs you.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.281
Well, is that a yes?

25:33.330 --> 25:35.651
I'm gonna check
with the other firm,

25:35.700 --> 25:37.918
see if they give me
a better offer.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.926
Yes, the imaginary firm.

25:39.970 --> 25:41.631
ALICIA:
If the vote

25:41.670 --> 25:45.265
were right now, how many coders
are in favor of unionizing?

25:45.310 --> 25:48.199
I mean, I think our
29 are pretty solid.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.037
And anti-union?

25:51.210 --> 25:54.008
(sighs) Management probably
has about the same number

25:54.050 --> 25:55.870
tied up.
So it's 29-29.

25:55.920 --> 25:56.944
And the swing votes?

25:56.980 --> 25:59.710
Uh, Linda Kennedy,
Eric Needleman--

25:59.750 --> 26:00.956
those could go either way.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.083
We need them both.
What if we got one

26:03.120 --> 26:05.020
and they got one
and it was 30-30...
You still lose.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.357
Tie goes
to management.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.926
Well, it's up to you,

26:07.960 --> 26:10.155
all of you, really,
to put pressure on these two.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.692
Make your case for unionizing.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.231
I'm glad we're taking the time
to do this today.

26:16.270 --> 26:17.862
We are all
on the same team here.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.903
Do you realize that we get
paid ten percent less than
staff at other Chicago firms

26:21.940 --> 26:24.079
of our size?
No, I wasn't
aware of that.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.646
LORNA:
But this isn't just
about the money.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.648
Hello.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.739
Don't mind me. Carry on.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.881
(clears throat softly):
Um... you were saying

26:32.920 --> 26:35.309
that there are
_ nonfinanCIal
issues as well?
LORNA: Yes.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.625
It would be nice if we
were able to go see our
kids in their school plays

26:39.990 --> 26:42.129
our performance evals.
DAVID: Alicia,
make a note.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.264
Any parent whose kid's
playing Jean Valjean

26:44.300 --> 26:46.029
gets the
afternoon off.
Come on, that's not...

26:46.070 --> 26:48.868
Okay, we are not discussing
solutions today.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.902
This is just
an introductory meeting

26:50.940 --> 26:52.362
to lay out everyone's concerns.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.970
Yeah. Let me lay out
my concerns.

26:55.010 --> 26:58.070
David, please...
You lay out
your top three concerns,

26:58.110 --> 27:00.078
and I'll lay out mine.
Okay.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.079
Number one, seven
percent pay bump.
That still puts us

27:03.120 --> 27:04.314
below the other
big firms.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.011
MARGIE:
And number two,
we would like

27:06.050 --> 27:07.813
to vest in a retirement plan
in three years, not five.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.987
DAVID: Never gonna happen.
Well, can you at least
hear us out?

27:10.020 --> 27:12.124
Why don't you go to another firm
to hear you out?

27:12.160 --> 27:13.696
Are you kidding?
Did you just

27:13.730 --> 27:15.721
threaten to...
To fire Margie? Yes, I did.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.352
She's only been
with me for 11 years.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.425
You I barely recognize,

27:19.470 --> 27:21.688
so if you want to go first,
or anybody else,

27:21.740 --> 27:23.162
step right up.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.907
(excited chatter)
If you terminate
Margie,

27:25.940 --> 27:28.329
we'll all go
on strike. _
You can't go on strike.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.746
You're not unionized.
Then we'll vote
to form a union.

27:30.780 --> 27:34.216
You can barely get my lunch
order right-- how are you...
Okay, everybody please

27:34.250 --> 27:36.343
(excited chatter)
just calm down,
calm down.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.112
(others cheering, laughing)

27:44.090 --> 27:46.149
18? Oh, my God, they're
gonna draft you any day now.

27:46.190 --> 27:48.090
VERONICA:
How sad is that?
You can get drafted at 18,

27:48.130 --> 27:49.392
but you can't drink till you're
21.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.022
I can buy cigarettes.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.867
Oh, that's progress.
And porn.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.936
Oh, good,
a healthy conversation.

27:54.970 --> 27:57.165
Mom really hasn't
gotten a handle

27:57.200 --> 27:59.236
on this whole gift thing.

27:59.270 --> 28:00.828
Hello, Alicia.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.199
(laughs)

28:02.240 --> 28:03.309
(indistinct chatter
in other room)
Mom seems happy.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.205
Well, she likes your kids.
For ten years
I've been

28:05.250 --> 28:07.275
trying to get her to see them--
now all at once.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.312
Well, she doesn't like babies;
they get on her nerves.

28:09.350 --> 28:11.443
How's Peter?
He's good.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.152
Why?
He... met with me.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.128
What?

28:18.160 --> 28:20.185
What does that mean?

28:20.230 --> 28:22.926
Well, he... met with
me about polling.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.121
(kiss)
Peter called you up,

28:25.170 --> 28:27.968
to meet with you
about polling?
Yeah. He's worried

28:28.000 --> 28:31.037
he's not doing well,
but he can't go negative
on Kresteva's sexism

28:31.070 --> 28:32.833
without hurting
himself with women.

28:34.810 --> 28:36.175
What?

28:36.210 --> 28:37.802
I'm not sure.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.478
I think I might be wrong

28:41.520 --> 28:42.919
about him.

28:42.950 --> 28:44.440
He's sweet...
in his way.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.811
Especially now--
he's very vulnerable.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.215
VERONICA:
So, what are you two
talking about?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.989
Just these

28:50.020 --> 28:52.159
wonderful presents, Mother.
Cock a doodle doo!

28:52.190 --> 28:55.227
I think they're excellent
for psychological role-playing.

28:55.260 --> 28:57.319
So, I'm gonna
give Zach some wine.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.225
Okay with you?
No.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.795
Oh, come on.
I let you drink wine at 16.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.831
I know.
You know, in Italy,
where they

29:03.870 --> 29:06.430
give kids wine at any age,
there's less public drunkenness

29:06.470 --> 29:09.030
than anywhere
in the world.
You just made that up, Mom.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.968
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Look it up.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.546
There's less public drunkenness
in Muslim countries

29:12.580 --> 29:14.218
where alcohol is outlawed.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.275
(chuckles)
(liquid pouring)

29:18.190 --> 29:20.146
What's wrong, Alicia?

29:22.260 --> 29:24.228
Peter asked her

29:24.260 --> 29:26.421
to _renew
their vows.
Can we please

29:26.460 --> 29:28.325
just have a conversation
between the two of us

29:28.360 --> 29:30.089
without you sharing it
with the whole world?

29:30.130 --> 29:31.791
What, I'm the whole world now?

29:31.830 --> 29:32.922
VERONICA:
Peter just wants
to tie you down.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.232
I know how he works.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.295
No, see, I-I think
we've judged him too harshly.

29:36.340 --> 29:39.104
Oh. Since when?
What happened?

29:39.140 --> 29:41.279
ALICIA:
Don't look at me.
I'm just domg the dishes.

29:41.310 --> 29:44.245
I talked to him, and I
think he's grown a lot.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.975
Oh, you are so easily swayed.

29:46.010 --> 29:48.114
No, I just, I want
my sister to be happy.

29:48.150 --> 29:49.469
And I don't want her
to be happy?

29:49.520 --> 29:50.987
If you end up
with Peter,

29:51.020 --> 29:52.885
in two months he'll be
back with the hookers.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.980
All right, I'm sorry,
do you want us to stop?
No. No, this is

29:56.020 --> 29:57.282
why I invite you over.
Fine.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.878
Peter talks to you;
I'll talk to Peter.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.194
Mom... you talk to Peter,

30:01.230 --> 30:03.494
and I'll never let you
see the kids again.

30:03.530 --> 30:05.998
This is my life.

30:06.030 --> 30:07.327
Understood?

30:09.340 --> 30:10.466
Good.

30:16.410 --> 30:18.901
I'm not gonna talk to Peter.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.168
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

30:21.220 --> 30:23.848
Sabrina, has Eugene
Kreskoff arrived?

30:23.890 --> 30:26.188
Sabnna?

30:27.220 --> 30:29.188
Eugene said they
worked the swing votes,

30:29.220 --> 30:31.859
Kennedy and Needleman,
for most of yesterday,
but so did management.

30:31.890 --> 30:34.051
Does he have a sense of
which way they're leaning?

30:34.100 --> 30:35.397
They're cautiously
optimistic,
but they wanted

30:35.430 --> 30:37.318
to make another run
at them this morning.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.964
We have a problem.
What?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.422
Kennedy and Needleman,
our swing votes--

30:40.470 --> 30:42.392
Blowtorch just fired them.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.203
CARY:
They can't do that.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.401
Blowtorch knew
Linda Kennedy
and Eric Needleman

30:46.440 --> 30:48.874
were the swing votes
the employees needed
to unionize.

30:48.910 --> 30:52.004
And that's why
they were fired.
No. They were fired for cause.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.403
Well, first of all...

30:53.450 --> 30:55.577
good morning, everyone.
(laughs)

30:55.620 --> 30:57.247
OTHERS:
Good morning, Rod.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.111
The two employees
that were terminated

30:59.150 --> 31:01.380
called in sick,
but as these videos show,

31:01.420 --> 31:02.978
they were not sick.

31:03.020 --> 31:06.421
These are Web chat videos
showing Needleman and Kennedy

31:06.460 --> 31:07.552
discussing wanting
to stay away from work.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.592
EUGENE:
Because they were sick
of being intimidated

31:09.630 --> 31:12.269
for their votes!
It doesn't matter the reason.
This is blue flu.

31:12.300 --> 31:15.360
They faked an illness to get out
of having to go to work,

31:15.400 --> 31:16.731
and the company is well
within their rights

31:16.770 --> 31:19.330
to fire them.
Not if the company
found out by spying on them.

31:19.370 --> 31:22.407
Oh, she's right, Nancy--
you can't spy on your employees.
Yes.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.249
And if they were monitoring
their Facebook pages,

31:24.280 --> 31:26.305
then that would be
spying, but this was
just routine monitoring.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.443
Recording their
private Web chat?

31:28.480 --> 31:30.983
Which were conducted
on company laptops.
Oh.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.988
These were company laptops.
That they had

31:33.020 --> 31:34.510
in their own homes,
where they had

31:34.560 --> 31:36.289
a legitimate
expectation
of privacy.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.254
I'm sorry... Rod,
but I am feeling

31:38.290 --> 31:39.985
a little bit ganged up on here.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.156
ROD:
Oh, I'm sorry, Nancy.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.657
Uh, Alicia, Cary,
could just one of you...

31:43.700 --> 31:45.327
argue?
CROZIER:
Thank you.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.588
The employee handbook
is unambiguous, Rod.

31:47.630 --> 31:49.063
Company-issued
equipment

31:49.100 --> 31:51.330
is subject
to monitoring
at all times.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.361
Yes. And if the company
combed through

31:53.410 --> 31:55.628
every e-mail and Web chat
that it monitored,

31:55.680 --> 31:57.238
they'd find other violations,

31:57.280 --> 31:58.577
too, but they haven't.

31:58.610 --> 32:00.441
_Because this
is just pretext.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.243
Blowtorch knew
those two employees

32:02.280 --> 32:04.419
were the swing votes
in a union election.

32:04.450 --> 32:06.281
Which is why
they stayed home.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.015
That is not why they were fired.
ROD:
Okay.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.949
Thank you. You've given me...
a lot to digest.

32:10.990 --> 32:14.323
(sighs): And again...
I think what's best here

32:14.360 --> 32:16.419
is compromise.

32:16.460 --> 32:17.392
Thank you.

32:17.430 --> 32:18.658
(bangs
ga
Rod? vel)

32:18.700 --> 32:20.019
Yes?

32:20.070 --> 32:22.129
What's the compromise?

32:22.170 --> 32:23.728
Oh. Uh, you get your election,

32:23.770 --> 32:26.500
and the company can fire
their employees for cause.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.474
What do we do now?
We have a
little less

32:28.510 --> 32:30.330
than three hours
before the vote.

32:30.380 --> 32:32.007
We need to pick
someone off.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.269
Where are you going?
To pick someone off.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.011
Can I talk to you?

32:42.290 --> 32:46.420
Charlene, ﬁrst let me start
by saying I regret what
happened between us in court.

32:46.460 --> 32:49.099
You have suffered
a terrible traged...
Please just hear me out.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.227
I'm not changing my vote.
Do you realize

32:51.270 --> 32:52.726
how important
this union could be?

32:52.770 --> 32:56.433
Don't you dare play
the "your husband
died for this" card.

32:56.470 --> 32:58.438
I know. I'm sorry.

32:58.470 --> 33:01.371
Could you... just let me in
for a minute?

33:01.410 --> 33:05.744
(sighs)

33:05.780 --> 33:07.077
Okay.

33:07.110 --> 33:10.477
Just give me a minute.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.511
(exhales)

33:22.200 --> 33:22.723
Hello?

33:22.760 --> 33:23.658
CROZIER:
Alicia, hi.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.123
As Ms. Peterson's lavwer,
I must ask you

33:26.170 --> 33:27.319
to desist.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.503
Close the door.

33:36.540 --> 33:38.679
(sighs)

33:38.710 --> 33:41.747
If I agreed to exclusivity,

33:41.780 --> 33:43.418
what would
you offer me?

33:43.450 --> 33:44.610
I don't know.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.413
Can you beat that amount?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.285
Is that what you're
being paid here?

33:52.330 --> 33:53.388
Can you beat it?

33:53.430 --> 33:55.523
If not, there's
no reason to talk.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.494
I might be able to.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.589
I'll have to talk
to my partners.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.068
Kalinda...

34:04.670 --> 34:07.161
I'm not getting in a bidding war
with Lockhart/Gardner.

34:07.210 --> 34:09.201
Good to know.

34:11.410 --> 34:13.173
DAVID:
It was a client lunch scheduled

34:13.210 --> 34:15.212
for my usual table
at Sabatino's, but Margie

34:15.250 --> 34:17.775
forgot to make the
reservation, and I had

34:17.820 --> 34:19.788
to eat at a table
by the kitchen.

34:19.820 --> 34:20.809
_ WILL:
Jenny's d0ing the same to me.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.715
They're trying to show us
how important they are.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.648
Are the clients
getting wind yet?
WILL:
Not yet.

34:24.690 --> 34:25.884
They will. The
staff is rebelling.

34:25.930 --> 34:28.649
I'm sure if we just make one or
two substantive concessions...

34:28.700 --> 34:31.260
You mean, surrender.
They're not being
unreasonable.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.689
Just because you came up short
for the Blowtorch workers,

34:33.730 --> 34:35.334
doesn't mean you can
expiate your guilt here.

34:35.370 --> 34:36.837
Easy, David.
DIANE:
All right.

34:36.870 --> 34:38.758
They see us spending more
on infrastructure,

34:38.810 --> 34:39.799
and they want more.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.273
The problem is precedent.

34:41.310 --> 34:44.609
We can't pay them all
more at the same time.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.277
That's why we should
fire the ringleaders.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.709
I'll cap Margie,
you get rid of what's-her-name,

34:47.750 --> 34:49.342
and I guarantee the rest of them

34:49.380 --> 34:50.847
will think twice before
they complain again.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.713
First of all, that sets us up
for years of lawsuits.

34:53.750 --> 34:54.717
Then let 'em sue.
You're management now.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.682
Start acting like it.
DIANE:
Okay, wait.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.756
Will, we need

34:58.790 --> 35:00.485
to split them
up, don't we?

35:03.300 --> 35:04.767
Let me think about it.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.734
You rang?
KALINDA:
I did.

35:08.770 --> 35:12.308
Look, if I commit,
what'll I get?

35:12.340 --> 35:14.535
You'll be exclusive
to Lockhart/Gardner?

35:14.580 --> 35:16.901
IfI agree,
what are you gonna give me?

35:16.940 --> 35:19.147
What do you want?

35:23.880 --> 35:26.314
More than that.

35:26.350 --> 35:28.682
Is this from your imaginary
new firm?

35:28.720 --> 35:30.187
Yup.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.858
I need more, Will.

35:31.890 --> 35:34.495
Well, unfortunately, we're in
the midst of a rebellion,

35:34.530 --> 35:37.249
so any talk of salary
increases will have to wait.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.699
Who's rebelling?

35:38.730 --> 35:40.664
The assistants.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.861
Why? Who were you thinking?

35:44.510 --> 35:46.569
So, when can you get back to me

35:46.610 --> 35:48.373
with an amount?
Don't know.

35:49.810 --> 35:53.246
Don't do anything stupid,
Kalinda, like leaving us.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.816
Look, I'm sure you'll be fine

35:54.850 --> 35:56.818
with Robyn
and the support staff.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.886
They're all family.

36:00.790 --> 36:03.759
_ ALICIA: _
Was it your intention,
Ms. Peterson,

36:03.790 --> 36:06.452
after receiving the $4 million
in company stock,

36:06.490 --> 36:09.323
to continue working at Blowtorch
as a coder?

36:09.360 --> 36:10.850
I'm sorry, Rod. Objection.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.425
If Alicia is intending to use
Ms. Peterson's recent absence

36:13.470 --> 36:15.267
during this time
of grieving to argue

36:15.300 --> 36:16.733
that she's no longer
an employee...

36:16.770 --> 36:17.759
I'm not arguing that at all.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.665
ROD:
Oh. Well, then,

36:19.710 --> 36:21.530
objection... uh, well,
let's not say overruled.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.502
Let's just say
it's delayed. (laughs)

36:23.540 --> 36:25.804
This is a copy
of Blowtorch corporate bylaws.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.977
Could you please turn
to page 63,

36:28.010 --> 36:29.875
and read paragraph

36:29.920 --> 36:32.844
two-A, Roman
numeral IV?

36:32.890 --> 36:35.916
"Any employee or non-employee
owning a minimum of five percent

36:35.960 --> 36:38.827
"of the outstanding common
shares of company stock

36:38.860 --> 36:42.455
shall be entitled to a voting
seat on the board of directors."

36:42.500 --> 36:45.867
And given that at the market's
close today, Blowtorch

36:45.900 --> 36:47.765
was worth a little less
than $77 million...

36:47.800 --> 36:50.462
Well, I'm sure
you can do the math.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.809
I see. So, she's a director
of the company?

36:52.840 --> 36:53.761
Yes, Rod,
which means

36:53.810 --> 36:56.699
she fits the NLRB definition
of management,

36:56.740 --> 36:58.241
and therefore,
cannot vote.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.441
Alicia, that's
very clever.
Thank you, Rod.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.368
You're welcome.
CROZIER:
But she has not taken her seat

37:02.420 --> 37:03.546
on the board.

37:03.580 --> 37:04.888
ALICIA:
No, but the
day she took

37:04.920 --> 37:06.911
the stock, she was no longer
qualified as an employee

37:06.950 --> 37:08.679
_ who could vote
in a union election.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.256
Well, I don't know
if that's true.

37:10.290 --> 37:13.282
But it sounds true.

37:13.330 --> 37:15.548
Rod, may I suggest
a compromise?

37:15.600 --> 37:17.898
No, that's okay.
I already have one.

37:17.930 --> 37:19.898
Ms. Peterson is no longer
eligible to vote,

37:19.930 --> 37:21.693
and the election is
to go fonNard

37:21.740 --> 37:22.889
without her.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.362
(gavelbangs)

37:27.610 --> 37:31.944
Kresteva is currently ahead of
your husband with female voters.

37:31.980 --> 37:34.813
Do you think
they see in Peter

37:34.850 --> 37:37.375
something they
do not trust?

37:38.920 --> 37:40.888
I think it's because

37:40.920 --> 37:43.616
the press has been more
interested in Peter's

37:43.660 --> 37:46.379
past failings as a family man,
for which

37:46.430 --> 37:47.920
he has long since atoned,

37:47.960 --> 37:50.428
than they are
in Mike Kresteva's present ones.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.496
Kresteva's present ones?

37:52.530 --> 37:54.532
That's an interesting idea.

37:54.570 --> 37:57.892
I mean, what is it
you mean specifically?

37:57.940 --> 38:00.659
Running a political campaign
is not a one-man show.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.575
For every candidate out there

38:02.610 --> 38:04.578
giving speeches
and kissing babies,

38:04.610 --> 38:07.306
there's a spouse
who's doing everything else.

38:07.350 --> 38:09.375
If everything is perfect,

38:09.420 --> 38:11.809
it is still tremendously hard

38:11.850 --> 38:13.818
on that spouse.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.408
And if it's not...

38:15.460 --> 38:16.984
If it's not, what?

38:17.020 --> 38:22.026
Do you want to draw a comparison
between Mike Kresteva

38:22.060 --> 38:24.051
and your husband?

38:28.870 --> 38:32.863
Mike Kresteva is struggling
with alcoholism.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.605
It is a serious disease...

38:34.640 --> 38:35.800
Did you talk to her?
No, this is her.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.831
...and one that he'll need
tremendous support to battle.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.075
But instead of prioritizing
his family

38:40.110 --> 38:42.078
and dealing with those issues,

38:42.120 --> 38:45.009
Mr. Kresteva has chosen

38:45.050 --> 38:47.848
_ to throw himself _
into a political campaign.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.757
If voters are asking themselves

38:50.790 --> 38:52.781
which candidate is more,

38:52.830 --> 38:54.798
truly more committed,

38:54.830 --> 38:56.923
to women and families,

38:56.960 --> 38:59.861
it's my husband, Peter Florrick.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.596
I know it now,
and I've always known it.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.962
VERONICA:
Hard to believe she can say that
with a straight face, isn't it?

39:06.010 --> 39:07.102
Ms. Loy.

39:07.140 --> 39:09.005
Please, call me Veronica.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.076
Um, okay.

39:11.110 --> 39:13.442
Are you here to see
David Lee, or...?

39:13.480 --> 39:15.448
No, I-I just saw him,
thank you.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.812
Actually, I was looking for you.

39:17.850 --> 39:21.013
Is there something
I can help you with... Veronica?

39:21.050 --> 39:23.518
Yes, as a matter
of fact, there is.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.653
Do you love my daughter?

39:25.690 --> 39:28.397
I'm sorry?
Because if you do,

39:28.430 --> 39:30.489
it's time to stop
being polite about it.

39:30.530 --> 39:33.090
You have a window,
but it's closing.

39:33.130 --> 39:35.928
That schmuck of a husband of
hers wants to renew their vows.

39:35.970 --> 39:37.096
And I know my daughter.

39:37.140 --> 39:38.607
If she does that,

39:38.640 --> 39:40.699
you're never gonna
pry her away from him.

39:40.740 --> 39:42.731
So you got to move now.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.439
It's very nice
to see you again, Ms. Loy.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.819
The vote is 29-28.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.464
In favor of, um...?

40:07.500 --> 40:09.593
Oh. Favor of unionizing.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.937
(overlapping chatter)

40:10.970 --> 40:12.767
Thank you both, so much.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.107
Congratulations.
ROD:
All right.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.005
All right, everyone. Settle
down there, have a seat.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.837
With this election
certified,

40:17.880 --> 40:20.678
this union becomes the_
authorized bargaining unit

40:20.710 --> 40:22.769
for member coders
at Blowtorch.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.845
Let the contract
negotiations begin.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.949
I'm sorry, Rod.
I don't think that Blowtorch

40:26.990 --> 40:29.049
will be able to participate
in those negotiations.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.819
You see,
the company's been sold.

40:30.860 --> 40:32.521
ROD:
Oh, my goodness. Really?
Sold to whom?

40:32.560 --> 40:35.791
I think you know the buyer,
actually. Chumhum?

40:35.830 --> 40:38.765
They really wanted Blowtorch
for the intellectual property

40:38.800 --> 40:40.028
and not the employees,

40:40.070 --> 40:43.562
so, it's a good thing
they got it so cheap.

40:45.970 --> 40:47.528
ALICIA:
Did you encourage

40:47.570 --> 40:49.629
all the union talk
at Blowtorch in order

40:49.680 --> 40:51.841
to drive the price
of the company down?
What?

40:51.880 --> 40:53.802
You brought
the case to us.
Yes.

40:53.850 --> 40:56.148
But after I brought it,
did you drive the price

40:56.180 --> 40:58.546
of the company down
for Ch'tlimhum?
o.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.546
So, it's just a coincidence
that Chumhum bought it?

41:00.590 --> 41:02.888
I don't know what it is, but
we didn't do anything wrong.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.559
Business just does
what business does, Alicia.

41:05.590 --> 41:08.889
And we're now running late
for a partners' meeting.

41:08.930 --> 41:10.795
DAVID:
Good!

41:10.830 --> 41:14.095
Ah, the executive committee
has arrived.

41:14.130 --> 41:15.893
How is it going?

41:15.940 --> 41:17.134
I've presented
our plan

41:17.170 --> 41:20.003
to the partnership, and I
think we've come to a consensus

41:20.040 --> 41:22.907
on how to handle the
clerical rebellion of 2013.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.504
I'd appreciate
at least being able

41:26.550 --> 41:28.768
to speak on behalf
of the assistants?
It's okay.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.845
We had another idea
on how to handle this.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.518
In addition
to their responsibilities

41:32.550 --> 41:33.778
supporting you and David,

41:33.820 --> 41:36.084
Lorna and Margie have both been
appointed staff coordinators.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.815
DAVID:
And while I'm sure we're both

41:37.860 --> 41:39.953
gonna miss their very friendly
faces around the firm,

41:39.990 --> 41:42.094
we're allowing them to
telecommute three days a week.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.667
WILL:
You asked us to listen,
so we listened.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.691
And this is what
they really wanted.

41:46.730 --> 41:47.890
And the other employees?

41:47.930 --> 41:49.238
We'll get to them in time.
Baby steps.

41:49.270 --> 41:52.933
You bought off
the ringleaders.

41:52.970 --> 41:54.631
We handled the problem

41:54.680 --> 41:57.137
in a way that protected
us and satisfied them.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.045
DAVID:
It's what management does.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.809
DIANE:
So,

42:00.850 --> 42:02.169
onto the next
order of busmess.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.869
This case based on a lead

42:06.050 --> 42:10.953
* So far it's not bad...

42:10.990 --> 42:12.787
(knocking)
PETER:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.754
Don't come on this bus unless
you have good news for me.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.756
I have good news.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.995
I did some polling
after the interview.

42:20.030 --> 42:23.261
* The way that you feel...

42:23.300 --> 42:25.268
Suburban,

42:25.310 --> 42:27.005
exu rban. . .
Across the board.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.008
Kresteva's lead
just got erased.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.031
It's a dead heat.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.741
(laughs)

42:32.780 --> 42:34.919
(door opens)

42:34.950 --> 42:37.748
It was your interview with
Charlie Rose that did this.

42:37.780 --> 42:39.884
(door closes)

42:39.920 --> 42:41.979
Hey.

42:42.020 --> 42:44.887
* I'd give up anything
to get used to this *

42:44.930 --> 42:45.919
(sighs)

42:45.960 --> 42:47.052
You promise me

42:47.090 --> 42:49.251
that you will never put me
through the same thing again.

42:49.300 --> 42:53.691
* I'd give up anything
to be home *

42:53.730 --> 42:56.335
* I'd give up anything to
be home... *

42:56.370 --> 42:58.338
Alicia...

42:58.370 --> 43:01.032
I promise.

43:01.070 --> 43:03.868
* And I've done everything
to get into this... *

43:03.910 --> 43:08.847
Then, yes, I would love
to renew our vows.

43:08.880 --> 43:11.371
Let's do it then.
