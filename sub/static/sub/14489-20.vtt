12:00.304 --> 12:03.557
"Theater to be demolished
to remove stink of new show."

12:03.641 --> 12:06.477
"Twelve hospitalized
for boredom at play."

12:06.560 --> 12:08.646
It says nine of them
are gonna be okay.

12:09.438 --> 12:13.192
So they really didn't like it.
They hated my acting.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.903
Not entirely. I mean,
"Worst play in history,"

12:15.986 --> 12:17.655
there's some ambiguity there.

12:17.738 --> 12:22.368
Ye gods! What manner of
beef-witted popinjay am I?

12:22.451 --> 12:24.536
Well, there's a couple
ways to answer that.

12:24.662 --> 12:26.622
The scales have
dropped from my eyes.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.749
I'm not the greatest
actor ever.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.085
I'm a talentless buffoon!

12:31.168 --> 12:32.711
And it's all your fault!

12:32.795 --> 12:35.089
Why did you drag me back
to this mortal realm?

12:35.172 --> 12:38.717
I was enjoying a happy death,
thinking I had died a star,

12:38.801 --> 12:40.177
until you showed up.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.221
Sorry.
Let us make it up to you.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.847
How about we
kill you again?

12:43.973 --> 12:45.933
Never. I'd be dead
for all eternity

12:46.016 --> 12:48.435
knowing everyone thinks
I'm a washed-up ham.

12:48.519 --> 12:51.605
And not the kind you hope for when
you're stranded on a desert island.

12:51.689 --> 12:53.274
My life is ruined.

12:53.357 --> 12:56.443
Well, just do a dramatic pause.
That always cheers you up.

12:56.527 --> 12:57.569
Never again.

12:57.653 --> 13:00.197
I'll never pause again.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.620
Calculon?
Yes?

13:06.704 --> 13:09.623
Are you done talking,
or is this a long pause?

13:09.707 --> 13:10.916
I'm done talking.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.334
Okay, that's
what I thought.

13:16.672 --> 13:17.840
(DOOR CREAKS SHUT)

13:25.055 --> 13:27.725
Come on, Calculon,
you can't just quit acting.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.685
I was never an actor.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.396
I was a self-deluded
blowhard full of hot air.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.732
Maybe I can get
a job as a hair dryer.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.191
That's good, steady work.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.402
No! We like you
and your big words.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.780
And we need you back on TV so we can
watch and not talk to each other.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.407
Our friendship depends on it!

13:43.490 --> 13:45.326
Your voice is so annoying!

13:45.409 --> 13:47.328
You always leave
the toilet seat crushed!

13:47.411 --> 13:48.579
See?

13:48.662 --> 13:50.164
Goodbye, boys.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.834
Isupposel
should thank you for

13:53.959 --> 13:56.378
giving me a second
chance at life, but...

13:57.212 --> 14:00.507
I'm not even sure
I deserved a first.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.010
Calculon, wait!

14:03.093 --> 14:05.137
That was the first
time I ever believed

14:05.262 --> 14:07.306
you were feeling
a genuine emotion.

14:07.389 --> 14:11.310
I was. It was shame.
I've never felt it before.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.686
Makes me want to eat.

14:12.770 --> 14:13.896
Do you have
a craft services table?

14:14.021 --> 14:15.147
No.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.024
Look, if you could
act like that,

14:17.107 --> 14:19.109
without all the pausing
and pretentiousness,

14:19.193 --> 14:21.862
you could be great.

14:21.945 --> 14:26.408
No, Leela. In the world of theater
there are no second acts.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.789
You're not leaving. We're
gonna get you your job baok.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.582
Yeah! How?

14:33.665 --> 14:36.210
He'll <i>audition for</i> a <i>bit part
on All My Circuits</i>

14:36.293 --> 14:37.753
in disguise.

14:37.836 --> 14:41.882
Buthe1lneedto act like we
just saw, modest and sincere.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.801
You really think it'll work?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.053
It sounds like
something that might work.

14:46.136 --> 14:49.264
Vveafing a costume and
pretending to be someone else

14:49.348 --> 14:51.892
goes against my every
instinct as an actor.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.977
But I'll give it a try!

15:02.820 --> 15:05.364
Okay, the audition's
all set up.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.740
Where's Calculon?

15:06.824 --> 15:08.283
And who's this goomer?

15:08.367 --> 15:09.785
(WHISPERING)
It's me, Calculon.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.869
(GASPS)

15:10.953 --> 15:12.287
Okay, just sit tight

15:12.371 --> 15:15.249
till they call the fake name
I made up for you.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.960
Mr. Derisgreat?
Mr. Ben Derisgreat?

15:18.043 --> 15:19.837
(WHISPERING) That's you.
Knock 'em dead.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.341
This is a very minor role.

15:24.425 --> 15:27.803
You'll be playing Calculon, back
from his kidnapping ordeal.

15:27.886 --> 15:28.887
Calculon?

15:28.971 --> 15:32.391
Yes. So make sure your acting
is over the top and horrible.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.560
You literally cannot
do this too crappily.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.311
You've already got the look.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.815
Old, past your prime,
a relic from a lamer era.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.860
You really do look disgusting.
A real Calculon type.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.278
Just... Ugh!

15:44.361 --> 15:45.696
Okay, you know what?
Just hire him.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.114
Done.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.449
(GASPS)

15:51.160 --> 15:54.121
It's humbling to be back on my
old soundstage as a bit player.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.247
Humble is good.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.707
Your self-esteem
took a beating,

15:56.790 --> 15:58.834
but that's what brought
out your true talent.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.296
Yes. You land hard when you
fall from the top, right?

16:02.379 --> 16:06.467
I used to be king here. Now I'm
nothing but a mere peasant.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.635
Or at best, a viscount.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.387
I think "peasant"
is about right.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.931
Duke. On this set,
I'm at least a duke.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.892
My extensive
acting resume dwarfs

16:14.975 --> 16:16.518
that of the average
bit player.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.979
Yes, that's true.
But remember,

16:19.104 --> 16:21.482
it's that kind of
acting that ruined you.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.651
Or maybe archduke. Whichever
one gets to fire the director.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.528
Oh, Lord, here we go.

16:26.612 --> 16:28.906
Look, please just
show some humility,

16:28.989 --> 16:31.492
like the other day when
everything seemed hopeless.

16:31.575 --> 16:35.329
Better yet, I'll whip their
emotions into a frenzy

16:35.412 --> 16:38.165
by taking a dramatic...

16:39.750 --> 16:41.752
Actors to the set!

16:43.086 --> 16:44.546
Okay, here's the scene.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.423
Calculon learns his
wife is unfaithful,

16:46.548 --> 16:48.342
whines about how
pathetic he is,

16:48.425 --> 16:51.762
kills himself, laugh, laugh,
laugh, go to commercial. Got it?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.055
And action!

16:53.138 --> 16:54.848
-~Dause!

16:55.974 --> 16:57.518
Still rolling.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.437
Oh, Calculon, lwish
you had never escaped

17:00.521 --> 17:02.356
from those
brutal crab fishermen.

17:02.439 --> 17:07.402
I want you to know I didn't wait
for you, not even for one day.

17:07.611 --> 17:12.782
(SIGHS) Then I suppose the honorable
thing would be to kill myself,

17:12.866 --> 17:15.536
if I weren't
the legendary Calculon,

17:15.661 --> 17:18.372
the greatest
acting unit of all time!

17:18.454 --> 17:21.875
This show is about me!
And it always has been!

17:21.959 --> 17:24.711
Now, find the co-executive
hack who wrote this drivel

17:24.795 --> 17:29.049
and tell him I want 37 more
climactic speeches by lunch!

17:29.132 --> 17:31.802
Cut! That was terrible!

17:31.885 --> 17:33.053
Just stick to the script.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.389
And if you don't get it on the
second take, you're fired.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.682
Let's take five, people.

17:36.807 --> 17:37.975
(BELL RINGS)

17:38.141 --> 17:39.560
Second take?

17:39.643 --> 17:41.645
I've never heard that phrase,
what does that mean?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.272
They want you
to do it again.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.398
What?

17:44.481 --> 17:46.066
You'll do great.
Just remember,

17:46.149 --> 17:48.485
you're getting devastating
news, so act more humble.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.946
Don't tell me
how to do humble!

17:51.029 --> 17:53.240
My humble ranks
among the greatest

17:53.365 --> 17:55.576
in the history
of the universe!

17:55.659 --> 17:58.370
Now, stand back
and watch the master at work.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.621
Whoo!

17:59.746 --> 18:00.872
You can do it, Calc-y!

18:00.956 --> 18:02.624
No. He can't.

18:02.708 --> 18:03.792
You beg my pardon?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.210
I'm sorry, Calculon,

18:05.294 --> 18:07.421
but someone needs
to remind you of the truth.

18:07.504 --> 18:11.925
You're a grade-B actor who died
and was immediately forgotten.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.927
Leela! That's not very nice.

18:14.011 --> 18:15.929
You're nothing but
a pompous windbag

18:16.013 --> 18:18.765
who lost touch with genuine
emotion years ago.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.602
The sad fact is, we should
have left you dead,

18:21.685 --> 18:24.855
because you can't possibly
do a scene like this.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.949
That was the meanest
thing I ever saw.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.493
Good. Maybe it'll work.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.537
Oh!

18:41.038 --> 18:42.122
(BLARING)

18:42.205 --> 18:43.290
Action!

18:43.373 --> 18:46.251
Oh, Calculon, lwish
you had never escaped

18:46.335 --> 18:48.128
from those
brutal crab fishermen.

18:48.211 --> 18:53.300
I want you to know I didn't wait
for you, not even for one day.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.722
(SIGHS) Then I suppose the honorable
thing would be to kill myself.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.727
I thought I could just
step back into my old life.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.314
But it seems the world
got on fine without me.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.191
Maybe even
a little bit better.

(WHIMPERING)

19:11.068 --> 19:12.402

19:12.944 --> 19:15.572
The name Calculon
used to mean something.

19:15.656 --> 19:17.908
Now it's a stain that
will never wash clean.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.244
Farewell.

19:23.538 --> 19:24.873

19:42.683 --> 19:45.352
Take a bow, Calculon!
You're the greatest!

19:45.435 --> 19:47.979
No. No more bows.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.565
Oh, go ahead,
you've earned it.

20:07.499 --> 20:10.836
of one great performance
