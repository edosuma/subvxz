<i>Previously on "Roadies..."</i>

00:08.928 --> 00:11.228
I don't even know if the
band are feeling it either.

00:11.263 --> 00:13.564
They haven't changed
their set since the last tour.

00:13.599 --> 00:15.065
New setlist.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.400
We're gonna open with "Janine" tonight.

00:16.435 --> 00:18.135
We need an opening act.

00:18.170 --> 00:19.837
I can't find a replacement by tonight.

00:19.872 --> 00:21.572
People are pissed at
you, 'cause you left.

00:21.607 --> 00:23.106
And you can't demand a nickname.

00:23.142 --> 00:24.808
That shit's, like, bestowed.

00:24.844 --> 00:26.276
I had my blood pressure checked.

00:26.312 --> 00:27.744
It scared a nurse.

00:27.780 --> 00:29.380
I have everyone on the lookout.

00:29.381 --> 00:30.647
Natalie Shayne is not
that good a stalker.

00:30.683 --> 00:32.082
Are you gonna lead morning circle?

00:32.116 --> 00:33.484
No, that was Phil's thing.

00:33.519 --> 00:35.285
The holding hands and all that.

00:35.321 --> 00:36.587
That's why it worked,
because it was his.

00:36.622 --> 00:37.588
Your little scheme to get me fired

00:37.623 --> 00:38.655
didn't quite come off.

00:38.691 --> 00:39.957
I didn't try to get you fired.

00:39.992 --> 00:41.425
You don't want to be my friend anyway.

00:41.460 --> 00:42.926
People on this tour don't like me.

00:42.962 --> 00:45.429
See you in Atlanta.

You are here right now

01:05.684 --> 01:08.151
<i>because of a perceived problem.</i>

01:08.187 --> 01:12.289
"Am I Too Serious?"

01:12.324 --> 01:13.524
Yes, you are.

01:13.559 --> 01:15.559
<i>And that's why you're here.</i>

01:15.594 --> 01:19.530
<i>First and foremost, becoming
less serious will be a process.</i>

01:19.565 --> 01:23.500
<i>You can start in the workplace
with a joke or two.</i>

01:23.536 --> 01:27.070
<i>You know, "Hey, uh, hard
at work, or 'hard' at work?"</i>

01:27.106 --> 01:29.039
<i>And that's funny in the bank.</i>

01:29.074 --> 01:32.175
<i>One good joke that makes people laugh</i>

01:32.211 --> 01:35.879
<i>can change the way
they feel about you forever.</i>

01:35.915 --> 01:38.815

01:38.851 --> 01:40.584
<i>that can make people laugh.</i>

01:40.619 --> 01:42.586
<i>And that's why we're on the planet.</i>

01:42.621 --> 01:44.354
Have you seen it?

01:44.390 --> 01:46.924
It's bad.

01:46.959 --> 01:49.192
What? Who died?

01:49.228 --> 01:50.894
We did.

01:50.930 --> 01:52.563
Motherfucker.

01:52.598 --> 01:54.231
Haven't you ever read
"The Bryce Newman Letter"?

01:54.266 --> 01:55.599
I mean, once or twice,
but I think all of his columns

01:55.634 --> 01:57.234
are the same.

01:57.269 --> 01:59.736
"Last night I found
myself watching a YouTube video

01:59.772 --> 02:02.205
of the Staton-House Band.

02:02.241 --> 02:04.441
I once liked this earnest American band.

02:04.476 --> 02:06.543
I thought I'd revisit
them in the harsh light

02:06.579 --> 02:07.844
of today's music business.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.681
Let me just say what no one's saying.

02:10.716 --> 02:15.452
The band have become relentlessly
irrelevant."

02:16.755 --> 02:18.121
It's a full-frontal assault.

02:18.157 --> 02:19.856
He didn't even go to the show.

02:19.892 --> 02:21.725
He reviewed a YouTube fan video.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.293
All right, I'm just
gonna go way out on a limb here

02:23.329 --> 02:25.429
and say it's not good.

02:25.464 --> 02:27.631
What are you, trying to be funny?

02:27.666 --> 02:29.433
- Keep reading. Keep reading.
- You know what?

02:29.468 --> 02:32.402
Who the fuck gave these people
the right to spew this shit?

02:32.438 --> 02:34.471
I'd like to meet this fucker
and wrap his tongue

02:34.506 --> 02:36.039
around his neck until it kills him.

02:36.075 --> 02:37.941
All right, that's a bit
of an overreaction, okay?

02:37.977 --> 02:39.710
He really goes after Rick.

02:39.745 --> 02:41.105
You go after Rick, you go after me.

02:41.113 --> 02:42.879
Wait. He insults you too.

02:42.915 --> 02:44.381
Wait. What? Where?

02:44.416 --> 02:47.417
"Bassist Rick Bayless
was clearly inebriated

02:47.453 --> 02:49.920
by the end of the evening, out of tune,

02:49.955 --> 02:53.223
and looking like a lost little
boy in search of his mommy,

02:53.258 --> 02:54.791
AKA the guitar tuner."

02:54.827 --> 02:57.995
All right.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.162
Let's kill him.

03:17.349 --> 03:18.582
Bill.

03:18.617 --> 03:20.183
Yeah.

03:20.219 --> 03:23.020
You know you got handsomer
since last year?

03:23.055 --> 03:26.289
Kind of like what
happens with the Marlboro man?

03:28.527 --> 03:32.295
Who's that?

03:32.331 --> 03:33.851
I guess you had to be there.

03:35.968 --> 03:39.002
You're as gorgeous as a yellow rose.

03:40.673 --> 03:43.006
You know, a yellow rose
means friendship.

03:44.576 --> 03:47.010
Is that right?

03:47.046 --> 03:49.212
Is that what we are?

03:54.720 --> 03:58.055
Oh, hell.

03:58.090 --> 04:00.991
Come on. Leave me alone.

04:01.026 --> 04:02.726
I'm gonna write this fucking guy.

04:02.761 --> 04:04.681
I can't bear... I
can't bear this anymore.

04:04.697 --> 04:06.563
- He wasn't even at the show.
- It's okay. We got this.

04:06.598 --> 04:07.864
Let's write him. Let's write
him. Let's write him.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.220
Write this, "Hey. Hey, asshole..."

04:09.234 --> 04:10.594
- Good.
- "Hey, asshole..."

04:10.602 --> 04:11.968
"Why don't you get your head

04:12.004 --> 04:13.537
out of Dave Grohl's hairy ass..."

04:13.572 --> 04:15.038
Oh, he fucking loves Dave Grohl.

04:15.074 --> 04:16.873
Everyone loves Dave Grohl.

04:16.909 --> 04:18.241
"...and be a real reviewer,

04:18.277 --> 04:19.810
because this... this
is not writing," all right?

04:19.845 --> 04:21.577
- No.
- "This... this is whining."

04:21.613 --> 04:23.046
Write that. Write it.

04:23.082 --> 04:24.648
Nice.

04:24.683 --> 04:26.416
Sending now.

04:26.452 --> 04:28.585
Good. Done. Boom.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.353
I like you better
without the accent, man.

04:30.389 --> 04:32.322
- Yeah, me too. Thanks.
- Nice.

04:32.357 --> 04:36.226
"Bryce Newman does not accept
mail from fans he doesn't know."

04:36.261 --> 04:37.701
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

04:37.730 --> 04:38.895
I love how he presumes we're his fans.

04:38.931 --> 04:41.498
- Fans, fans.
- You people love drama.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.033
You're right. You're
right. You know what?

04:43.068 --> 04:44.534
I'm done. Done.

04:44.570 --> 04:46.103
- Me too.
- Done.

04:46.138 --> 04:47.898
- I'm done.
- Just keep... keep reading it...

04:47.906 --> 04:50.774
"Hunger is the active ingredient
in an artist's journey..."

04:50.809 --> 04:53.376
Oh, my God.

04:53.412 --> 04:56.713
<i>And the Staton-House Band
is no longer hungry.</i>

04:56.749 --> 04:59.516
<i>They are coasting on the music
of moper-extraordinaire</i>

04:59.551 --> 05:01.618
<i>Christopher House, who
once and for all proves</i>

05:01.653 --> 05:03.887
<i>on their current Capture the Flag tour</i>

05:03.922 --> 05:06.056
<i>that he hasn't written a real true song</i>

05:06.091 --> 05:08.425
<i>since the days of "Janine."</i>

05:08.460 --> 05:10.193
<i>I found myself missing the old days,</i>

05:10.229 --> 05:13.363
<i>when a Staton-House Band
album was still an event,</i>

05:13.398 --> 05:15.866
<i>and I'd drive up the coast
in my yellow vintage Volvo</i>

05:15.901 --> 05:18.468
<i>and get that great
pastrami sandwich at the Hat</i>

05:18.504 --> 05:21.304
<i>with an amazing
French dip that came with it.</i>

05:21.340 --> 05:23.106
<i>Oh, who would have thought over time</i>

05:23.142 --> 05:25.275
<i>that a French pastrami dip sandwich</i>

05:25.310 --> 05:29.813
<i>would be more relevant than
the songs of Christopher House?</i>

05:29.848 --> 05:34.651
Dude, he compared your band
to a pastrami sandwich.

05:34.686 --> 05:36.219
That's fucked up.

05:36.255 --> 05:38.755
We should have never started
playing "Janine."

05:43.495 --> 05:46.062
Don't blame yourself for
making them change the setlist.

05:46.098 --> 05:48.932
This is not totally your fault.

05:48.967 --> 05:51.087
- It's a little your fault.
- It's kind of your fault.

06:03.549 --> 06:06.082
Oh, Cassie, I need a hug.

06:06.118 --> 06:10.954
Oh, hey, Dionne. This is Bill.

06:10.989 --> 06:12.122
Hello, sir.

06:12.157 --> 06:13.290
Hi.

06:13.325 --> 06:14.591
What's wrong, D?

06:14.626 --> 06:16.259
I'm just kinda bummed.

06:16.295 --> 06:19.029
I took MDMA last night,
and I parked in the wrong spot.

06:19.064 --> 06:22.265
And the landlord had my spot
taken away and got my car towed.

06:22.301 --> 06:23.500
Tuesdays, right?

06:23.535 --> 06:26.536
It's Thursday.

06:26.572 --> 06:27.938
Hey, Bill, honey, would you scoot over?

06:27.973 --> 06:29.439
- I'm just gonna...
- Oh, yeah.

06:29.474 --> 06:30.954
I'm gonna wrap myself in this blanket

06:30.976 --> 06:32.509
so I'm not totally naked.

06:32.544 --> 06:35.145
I hate to make you scoot over, but mmm,

06:35.180 --> 06:38.815
mmm, thanks.

06:38.851 --> 06:42.686
I'm just kind of blue this morning.

06:42.721 --> 06:43.687
Yeah.

06:43.722 --> 06:45.288
You know what?

06:45.324 --> 06:47.557
I'm gonna make everybody breakfast.

06:47.593 --> 06:49.726
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

06:49.761 --> 06:51.027
Bill, do you have to work super early?

06:51.063 --> 06:53.063
Yeah, but I think I
can... I think I can...

06:53.098 --> 06:55.232
- Got a little time, yeah.
- Stay for breakfast?

06:55.267 --> 06:56.666
Mm-hmm, okay.

07:00.539 --> 07:02.839
Sorry about your parking spot.

07:04.409 --> 07:06.076
She's an amazing girl.

07:06.111 --> 07:08.578
Yeah, she sure is.

07:08.614 --> 07:11.348
I try and get to Atl...

07:11.383 --> 07:14.384
Atlanta as often as I can.

07:14.419 --> 07:17.554
Yeah, she calls you Mr. Once A Year.

07:29.368 --> 07:31.868
I love you.

07:33.739 --> 07:35.372
You caught me by surprise.

07:37.309 --> 07:38.608
Me too.

07:38.644 --> 07:40.044
I mean, I only see you once a year,

07:40.045 --> 07:42.078
so I might as well get to the point.

07:42.114 --> 07:46.750
Yeah, well, come to the
show tonight, okay?

07:46.785 --> 07:49.452
I'll send a runner to come get you.

07:49.488 --> 07:52.122
I want to see you more than once a year.

08:00.465 --> 08:02.766
It's up to you.

09:10.235 --> 09:13.536
Where in the holy hell
were you, fuckface asshole?

09:13.572 --> 09:16.539
Hey, it's good to be
really loved, you know?

09:16.575 --> 09:18.141
Even if it's only once a year.

09:18.176 --> 09:19.309
What was her name?

09:19.344 --> 09:20.643
Cassie.

09:20.679 --> 09:22.012
I remember Cassie,

09:22.047 --> 09:23.480
the surfer with the Lana Del Rey eyes.

09:23.515 --> 09:25.682
- Yeah, the eyes.
- Okay, let me put it like this.

09:25.717 --> 09:26.983
I don't give a fuck about her eyes.

09:27.019 --> 09:29.452
Everybody is melting down here.

09:29.488 --> 09:31.654
I have not read "The Bryce
Newman Letter" yet.

09:31.690 --> 09:33.123
Oh, it's super not good.

09:33.158 --> 09:34.691
Yeah, well,
Christopher hasn't called me.

09:34.726 --> 09:36.292
Christopher's still asleep.

09:36.328 --> 09:38.194
But he's gonna wake up
and check his phone.

09:38.230 --> 09:41.898
And you can bet 25 "friends" are
gonna have written him saying,

09:41.933 --> 09:43.533
"Oh, man, are you okay?"

09:43.568 --> 09:45.135
And...

09:45.170 --> 09:47.670
Yep, that's Preston calling again.

09:47.706 --> 09:49.672
Oh, if I could only be a "Cassie."

09:49.708 --> 09:51.808
My biggest problem would be
cutting my perfect bangs.

09:51.843 --> 09:53.743
They are good.

09:53.779 --> 09:55.678
Just...

09:55.714 --> 09:56.880
Good morning, Preston.

09:56.915 --> 09:58.848
Good morning, Sweet William.

09:58.884 --> 10:01.317
How's that big shit Bryce Newman
left on your doorstep?

10:01.353 --> 10:03.186
I got to pee.

10:03.221 --> 10:04.988
Just tell me, why did we start
changing the setlist?

10:05.023 --> 10:07.924
Well, we had a beautiful
breeze of inspiration

10:07.959 --> 10:09.392
that just kind of
blew on through the tour.

10:09.428 --> 10:10.860
We got lucky.

10:10.896 --> 10:13.396
Well, just shut
that fucking breeze down.

10:13.432 --> 10:14.431
Everybody in the industry
reads this guy,

10:14.466 --> 10:16.499
and it's embarrassing.

10:16.535 --> 10:18.701
<i>Now, look, I'm trying to
get on a plane down there today,</i>

10:18.737 --> 10:21.071
but with this fucking El Niño,
it's a goddamn nightmare,

10:21.106 --> 10:22.605
and nothing's moving.

10:22.641 --> 10:24.841
Anyway, my son has
this situation with his leg.

10:24.876 --> 10:26.209
I thought it was his arm.

10:27.546 --> 10:29.512
It's both. He's a wreck.

10:29.548 --> 10:30.547
13-year-old kid.

10:30.582 --> 10:31.948
His mother never calls him.

10:31.983 --> 10:33.783
He tears his ligament,
and he said to me,

10:33.819 --> 10:35.018
"Will you be here for me, Dad?"

10:35.053 --> 10:36.853
I mean, what do you say to that?

10:36.888 --> 10:38.621
So what you're saying is,
you want me to take care of it

10:38.657 --> 10:40.423
in case you don't show up.

10:40.459 --> 10:41.758
Look, Christopher's gonna take this

10:41.793 --> 10:43.593
right to the not-relevant part.

10:43.628 --> 10:45.261
<i>And he's gonna hold it against Tom,</i>

10:45.297 --> 10:46.963
<i>which is a whole other problem
for us to talk about...</i>

10:46.998 --> 10:48.278
<i>I mean, when we're face-to-face.</i>

10:48.300 --> 10:49.899
What does that mean?

10:49.935 --> 10:52.702
We have to keep this from Christopher
as long as possible.

10:52.737 --> 10:54.537
<i>Well, I've got it taken care of, boss.</i>

10:54.573 --> 10:56.813
Now, would you like to hear
some good news on the subject

10:56.842 --> 10:58.308
of that hideous problem of
opening acts for this tour?

10:58.343 --> 11:00.076
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

11:00.112 --> 11:01.952
Reg Whitehead's
calling me. Let's patch him in.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.746
<i>Preston.</i>

11:03.782 --> 11:05.949
<i>Yeah, what would it cost
to put some strychnine</i>

11:05.984 --> 11:07.784
in Bryce Newman's
pastrami fucking sandwich?

11:07.819 --> 11:09.419
<i>I think I have a solution, Preston.</i>

11:09.421 --> 11:11.154
Reg, Preston and I actually...

11:11.189 --> 11:12.989
I think we actually got
a way to work this out so...

11:13.024 --> 11:14.657
Yeah, I've been here all
morning thinking about it.

11:14.693 --> 11:17.127
You weren't here, Bill, okay? Thank you.

11:17.162 --> 11:18.895
So realistically, Christopher
will read it.

11:18.930 --> 11:20.630
But more important than that,

11:20.665 --> 11:25.168
330,000 Bryce Newman readers
have already read it.

11:25.203 --> 11:28.404
So, Preston, great Preston,

11:28.440 --> 11:32.242
we neutralize Bryce Newman now.

11:32.277 --> 11:34.144
We lead with sugar.

11:36.481 --> 11:38.581
We invite Bryce Newman to the show.

11:38.617 --> 11:39.983
Disastrous.

11:40.018 --> 11:41.618
<i>Wait. This is a very sexy idea.</i>

11:41.620 --> 11:42.852
The crew will kill him.

11:42.888 --> 11:44.420
<i>I'll call Irving Azoff.</i>

11:44.456 --> 11:45.955
<i>We'll get him to the show tonight.</i>

11:45.991 --> 11:46.956
We'll fly him in. We'll kiss his ass.

11:46.992 --> 11:48.158
He'll reverse himself.

11:48.193 --> 11:49.659
<i>- Done.
- Done.</i>

11:49.694 --> 11:51.528
Hey, fellas, this is not
the way things work.

11:51.563 --> 11:53.263
I want the best pastrami
sandwich in Atlanta

11:53.298 --> 11:55.465
waiting for him when he gets there.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.634
Got it.

11:57.669 --> 11:58.935
Fuck.

12:02.073 --> 12:04.174
Hot 'Lanta.

12:04.209 --> 12:08.645
Did you know that if you're...

12:08.680 --> 12:10.880
did you know that...

12:10.916 --> 12:13.550
Atlanta is...

12:13.585 --> 12:16.119
All right, I'm just gonna go ahead

12:16.154 --> 12:17.654
and say the name, all right?

12:17.689 --> 12:18.888
Phil.

12:18.924 --> 12:20.957
Phil spent a lot of time in this city.

12:20.992 --> 12:23.860
Phil stood on the side of the
stage at the Fox Theatre

12:23.895 --> 12:26.629
when Ronnie Van Zant said,

12:26.665 --> 12:29.299
"What song is it you want to hear?"

12:29.334 --> 12:31.968
And Lynyrd Skynyrd played.

12:32.003 --> 12:34.871
Boy, did they play.

12:34.906 --> 12:39.876
It's a burning,
churning city of soul and desire.

12:39.911 --> 12:43.546
- OutKast was born here, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:43.582 --> 12:46.316
Julia Roberts, though not a musician,

12:46.351 --> 12:48.351
was... she likes music.

12:48.386 --> 12:50.486
Donald Glover put his name

12:50.522 --> 12:53.656
into a Wu-Tang Clan name generator

12:53.692 --> 12:56.092
and became Childish Gambino.

12:56.127 --> 12:58.895
And believe it or not, Spike Lee.

12:58.930 --> 13:00.330
Are you kidding?

13:00.365 --> 13:01.331
Not Brooklyn?

13:01.366 --> 13:02.765
No, Atlanta.

13:02.801 --> 13:05.501
I'ma say the name. Kanye West.

13:05.537 --> 13:08.605
You put all those people
in a room together,

13:08.640 --> 13:13.176
and you've got a room
full of people from Atlanta.

13:13.211 --> 13:17.580
Now, for the next three days,
the next three shows,

13:17.616 --> 13:20.783
our very special guest
that's gonna be opening is...

13:20.819 --> 13:23.052
Lindsey Buckingham.

13:23.088 --> 13:24.687
Wow.

13:24.723 --> 13:26.389
- Oh, yeah, really?
- Right? Huh? How about...

13:26.424 --> 13:27.924
Fantastic. I'm a really huge fan of his.

13:27.959 --> 13:30.593
Yeah. Reg Whitehead. Thank you. Thanks.

13:30.629 --> 13:33.363
Um, okay, so just before you all...

13:33.398 --> 13:35.632
you don't have
to... you can stop holding.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.133
Thanks very much.

13:37.168 --> 13:38.201
Okay, so I'm sure that most of you read

13:38.236 --> 13:39.936
"The Bryce Newman Letter."

13:39.971 --> 13:42.739
As part of our intention
to win this man around

13:42.774 --> 13:44.941
and show him what we are all about,

13:44.976 --> 13:47.744
I have invited him to the next show.

13:47.779 --> 13:49.579
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

13:49.614 --> 13:52.315
And guess what? He has accepted,
which is great.

13:52.350 --> 13:55.451
Bryce is gonna drop by here
on his way to Los Angeles.

13:55.487 --> 13:57.420
So I want you to treat him like a king.

13:57.455 --> 13:59.822
I want you to kiss his ass

13:59.858 --> 14:04.560
and reap the benefits as
he retracts what he wrote.

14:04.596 --> 14:07.430
And, people...

14:07.465 --> 14:11.000
let us lead with sugar.

14:24.349 --> 14:26.349
What does a
stagehand smell like after sex?

14:26.384 --> 14:27.583
Mace.

14:27.619 --> 14:29.285
Okay, so you know this joke.

14:29.321 --> 14:31.087
You're not funny, but not everybody is.

14:31.122 --> 14:33.623
If you'll excuse me,
I need to yellow jacket

14:33.658 --> 14:35.191
the best pastrami sandwich in Atlanta,

14:35.226 --> 14:36.626
and let's just say, Atlanta, Georgia,

14:36.661 --> 14:38.695
not the fucking
pastrami capital of the world.

14:38.730 --> 14:40.196
Good luck.

14:40.231 --> 14:43.533
Oh, and if you hear
about the crew pulling any shit

14:43.568 --> 14:45.268
on Bryce Newman, you let me know.

14:45.303 --> 14:46.869
Well, all I know is that
you've got to be nice

14:46.905 --> 14:48.338
to Donna today, because
she broke up with Laurie.

14:48.373 --> 14:49.872
And in further news, the sky is blue.

14:49.908 --> 14:50.908
They break up constantly.

14:50.909 --> 14:52.141
No, this is serious.

14:59.517 --> 15:01.984
Nobody likes my jokes.

15:02.020 --> 15:05.555
You know, I've been thinking
of all the possible ways we have

15:05.590 --> 15:07.290
to fuck with Bryce Newman.

15:07.325 --> 15:10.059
Whether it's one insane, wild takedown,

15:10.095 --> 15:12.061
or 100 little stabs of fuck-with-him,

15:12.097 --> 15:13.696
I'm gonna bring this guy
a kaleidoscope of pain.

15:13.732 --> 15:15.465
We must.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.833
No, Wes, you just got here,
and you're gonna get everybody...

15:16.868 --> 15:17.988
mainly me... in a lot of shit.

15:18.002 --> 15:19.335
You don't understand.

15:19.371 --> 15:20.851
Reg said it was okay to fuck with him.

15:20.872 --> 15:23.039
- What?
- You don't get it.

15:23.074 --> 15:25.341
He can't say "fuck with him."

15:25.377 --> 15:26.642
He's English.

15:26.678 --> 15:28.911
He weasel-speaks between the lines.

15:28.947 --> 15:32.081
Look, he says "Oh, show
him a great time,"

15:32.117 --> 15:33.683
but that's not what he really means.

15:33.718 --> 15:35.585
I'm pretty sure he just means
show him a good time.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.354
Wes.

15:38.390 --> 15:39.989
Hi.

15:40.024 --> 15:44.594
I hope you're going
to make Bryce Newman a...

15:44.629 --> 15:45.828
memorable espresso.

15:45.864 --> 15:47.663
You want it memorable?

15:47.699 --> 15:49.732
Memorably memorable.

15:49.768 --> 15:51.000
I'm your guy.

15:51.035 --> 15:53.503
Terrific.

16:00.044 --> 16:01.677
- See?
- No, I really don't.

16:01.713 --> 16:03.379
And I don't think you should
take it upon yourself

16:03.415 --> 16:08.184
to wreak havoc with a crew
that you have just joined.

16:08.219 --> 16:11.020
Why can't you just support my goals?

16:18.997 --> 16:22.231
Hey, I heard you had a rough night.

16:22.267 --> 16:25.701
Yep, I broke up with dum-dum.

16:25.737 --> 16:28.938
I hate it when you call
Laurie "dum-dum."

16:28.973 --> 16:31.908
Shelli, I must be desperate,

16:31.943 --> 16:34.076
'cause I'm gonna ask you for advice.

16:34.112 --> 16:35.978
How do you keep your marriage together?

16:36.014 --> 16:39.382
Two tours, two different time zones...

16:39.417 --> 16:42.952
You see, uh, Sean and I have dates.

16:42.987 --> 16:45.154
- When?
- Three times a week.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.557
On the phone, for at least ten minutes.

16:47.592 --> 16:49.659
And let me tell you, we go there.

16:49.694 --> 16:51.627
It solves problems.

16:51.663 --> 16:53.596
I'll be honest, I've missed
the last three dates,

16:53.631 --> 16:55.264
and it's not been good.

16:55.300 --> 16:56.566
That's how we stay connected.

16:56.601 --> 16:58.267
We have fucking amazing phone sex.

16:58.303 --> 17:00.102
We plan on what we're
gonna do when we're together.

17:00.138 --> 17:02.271
And then we do it.

17:02.307 --> 17:03.806
And you don't hold back?

17:03.842 --> 17:05.273
Ha, no.

17:05.310 --> 17:07.076
What do you do, just
turn to Bill and say,

17:07.111 --> 17:08.845
"Hey, excuse me, time for me to go have

17:08.880 --> 17:10.746
wild fucking orangutan phone sex"?

17:10.781 --> 17:11.981
Are you nuts?

17:12.016 --> 17:13.683
Bill doesn't know.

17:13.718 --> 17:15.318
He'd feel compelled to act jealous.

17:15.353 --> 17:17.286
No, you slip away.

17:17.321 --> 17:18.788
Say you have a problem
with your mother-in-law,

17:18.823 --> 17:22.124
which I, in fact, do,
but, no, you just disappear.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.261
And trust me, there is
no crisis so relevant

17:25.296 --> 17:29.131
it can't wait ten minutes.

17:29.167 --> 17:32.101
Always be punctual, and remember,

17:32.136 --> 17:34.537
it's not duty; it's dessert.

17:34.572 --> 17:36.506
Wow.

17:36.541 --> 17:38.708
Did we just have, like,
a personal conversation?

17:38.743 --> 17:41.511
Sean and I are gonna go, uh,

17:41.546 --> 17:42.612
build some bridges this afternoon,

17:42.647 --> 17:43.779
if you know what I mean.

17:48.553 --> 17:49.619
Whoa.

17:53.925 --> 17:58.494
Hey, whatcha got for dessert?

17:58.530 --> 18:02.231
I'm friends with Mr.
Stanley "Stan" Sativa.

18:02.267 --> 18:03.399
Whatcha looking for?

18:03.434 --> 18:04.734
The case.

18:13.244 --> 18:14.911
Ohh, okay, I'm looking for something

18:14.946 --> 18:17.580
savagely and ruthlessly hallucinogenic.

18:17.615 --> 18:21.517
I am out of ayahuasca,
but I do have PurpleVagina.

18:21.553 --> 18:23.019
Mm, I don't know that one.

18:23.054 --> 18:24.554
PurpleVagina?

18:24.589 --> 18:25.755
Oh, it pretty much takes
you back to your childhood

18:25.790 --> 18:26.923
and leaves you there.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.291
Anything stronger?

18:30.261 --> 18:32.695
I have Joshua Tree 37. This is new.

18:32.730 --> 18:35.164
It comes from the fresh-ground,
first-stage flower buds

18:35.199 --> 18:36.832
of the Colombian cacti.

18:36.868 --> 18:38.948
You just need to be in
the country when you ingest it

18:38.970 --> 18:42.672
where there's trees, water, a field.

18:42.707 --> 18:45.841
Your reality becomes whatever you see.

18:45.877 --> 18:49.278
Whatever you see, you want to become.

18:49.314 --> 18:51.414
I'm fucking warming
up to Joshua Tree 37.

18:51.449 --> 18:54.050
Some people can appear in the
form of satyr-like demons

18:54.085 --> 18:56.586
or rodent-like creatures.

18:56.621 --> 18:58.220
And stay away from mirrors.

18:58.256 --> 18:59.455
Yeah, dude.

18:59.490 --> 19:01.257
Give me all of that.

19:13.004 --> 19:14.770
- Harvey.
- Yeah.

19:14.806 --> 19:18.541
Do you look at me and think,
"She's as serious as a glacier"?

19:18.576 --> 19:20.309
Uh, I don't know. A glacier?

19:20.345 --> 19:23.913
Okay, how do you know
when a drummer is at your door?

19:23.948 --> 19:24.914
Tell me.

19:24.949 --> 19:27.783
"Domino's."

19:27.819 --> 19:30.052
Hmm.

19:30.088 --> 19:32.755
So that means that my
joke, it wasn't funny.

19:32.790 --> 19:35.558
No, uh, but I'll help you.

19:35.593 --> 19:36.892
I'll help you.

19:36.928 --> 19:38.894
'Cause funny is not what you say

19:38.930 --> 19:40.796
but how you say it.

19:40.832 --> 19:41.831
We'll keep at it.

19:41.866 --> 19:44.066
You'll be funny by Baltimore.

20:17.835 --> 20:21.671
Okay, okay, my friends, excuse me.

20:21.706 --> 20:25.174
Lindsey Buckingham's gonna
show up in about five minutes,

20:25.209 --> 20:26.842
so anything other than
"Hail to the Chief,"

20:26.878 --> 20:28.444
I don't want to hear it. Thank you.

20:28.479 --> 20:30.946
Just need a little
professionalism and some focus

20:30.982 --> 20:32.982
that sometimes can be a little lacking

20:33.017 --> 20:34.857
around these parts, so
thanks, gang, but just...

20:34.886 --> 20:36.152
Oh, come on, Bill.

20:36.187 --> 20:37.653
Let the kids play.

20:37.689 --> 20:39.221
You look good.

20:39.257 --> 20:40.890
Hey, don't tell me about looking good.

20:40.925 --> 20:42.358
You look good.

20:42.393 --> 20:44.326
Oh, man.

20:44.362 --> 20:46.062
Hey, let me get you a bullet coffee.

20:46.097 --> 20:48.064
It's so good to see you.
Thanks for helping out.

20:48.099 --> 20:49.832
Oh, only for you.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.834
Lindsey, I owe you
big time for this, thanks.

20:51.869 --> 20:53.803
We've been through
too much for me to say no.

20:53.838 --> 20:55.638
Yeah, yeah. Hey, Stan. How you doing?

20:55.673 --> 20:57.707
We got a great dressing
room set up for you guys.

20:57.742 --> 20:59.241
This is gonna be good.

20:59.277 --> 21:00.597
This is gonna be great. Oh, yeah.

21:00.611 --> 21:02.011
- Hey.
- Yeah.

21:02.046 --> 21:03.379
You, uh, still doing the program?

21:03.414 --> 21:05.347
Oh, yeah. No, everything's good.

21:05.383 --> 21:07.316
Got two years in July.

21:07.351 --> 21:08.718
I'm clean and sober.

21:08.753 --> 21:10.352
Everything's been going good, yeah.

21:10.388 --> 21:12.488
Uh-huh, because, you know, I
do worry about you sometimes.

21:12.523 --> 21:13.589
Yeah, I know.

21:13.624 --> 21:14.924
Remember that time at the tiki bar,

21:14.959 --> 21:16.559
where you took that torch...

21:16.594 --> 21:18.561
Yeah, no, I'm still
not allowed in that hotel,

21:18.596 --> 21:20.663
and I'm... I'm...
I'm not that guy anymore.

21:20.698 --> 21:23.332
Had to do 700 hours
of community service.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.900
God, it's good to see you, man.

21:24.936 --> 21:27.937
Man, you feel like a damn linebacker.

21:53.131 --> 21:54.797
<i>Check it again, please.</i>

21:56.400 --> 21:57.767
No Bruce Newman on the list.

21:57.802 --> 21:59.735
Don't make me make phone calls.

21:59.771 --> 22:01.370
I'm on the list, all-access.

22:01.405 --> 22:04.807
And the name is Bryce Newman.

22:04.842 --> 22:07.810
Let's see some ID.

22:07.845 --> 22:10.212
Very well, young lady.

22:10.248 --> 22:12.948
Enjoy that on your path
to total mediocrity.

22:14.986 --> 22:16.619
This says "Newbert Billingsley."

22:16.654 --> 22:17.887
That's my birth name.

22:17.922 --> 22:19.889
Bryce Newman is my professional name.

22:19.924 --> 22:22.291
Jesus, you unhelpful Millennial.

22:22.326 --> 22:24.326
Would you like to see my income
tax returns as well?

22:24.362 --> 22:26.829
Call Reg Whitehead.

22:26.864 --> 22:28.931
If I leave, it is going
to be your fault,

22:28.966 --> 22:31.500
and you will join the great
unemployed wasteland

22:31.536 --> 22:35.137
that is your generation.

22:35.173 --> 22:37.406
I've never heard of anybody
named Newbert before.

22:37.441 --> 22:39.742
Oh, my God.

22:39.777 --> 22:40.810
I know who you are.

22:40.845 --> 22:42.978
You're, like, so famous.

22:43.014 --> 22:44.647
You're, like, the actual molecules

22:44.682 --> 22:47.349
that make up the actual Bryce Newman.

22:47.385 --> 22:50.019
He's the most-read music
blogger in the entire social universe.

22:50.054 --> 22:51.454
Actually, I'm the number one

22:51.455 --> 22:53.455
industry analyst and critic.

22:53.491 --> 22:55.524
I am the author of
"The Bryce Newman Letter."

22:55.560 --> 22:58.861
Blogging is what
amateurs do when they type.

22:58.896 --> 23:00.296
Katy Perry wrote a song about him.

23:00.331 --> 23:02.164
Really? Which one?

23:02.200 --> 23:03.532
"Negative Jerk." Look it up. You'll see.

23:03.568 --> 23:07.870
Somehow I don't need to look it up.

23:07.905 --> 23:10.472
Oh, here it is, Bryce Newman.

23:10.508 --> 23:12.208
You I like. Here are two passes.

23:12.243 --> 23:14.310
Take him if you want to.

23:14.345 --> 23:18.314
I don't want to look
at his face anymore.

23:18.349 --> 23:20.216
Congratulations.

23:20.251 --> 23:22.685
You're my date.

23:25.857 --> 23:28.524
Shit.

23:28.559 --> 23:30.292
Well, well, well, Natalie Shayne.

23:30.328 --> 23:31.808
What are you doing here? Milo to Puna.

23:31.829 --> 23:34.463
Shh, shh, Bryce Newman
is in the bathroom.

23:34.498 --> 23:35.831
I snuck in with him.

23:35.867 --> 23:37.267
You see what he wrote in the letter?

23:37.268 --> 23:38.500
He... will... pay.

23:38.536 --> 23:42.204
Yes... he... will.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.241
Hey, you work with us,
I won't throw you out.

23:47.078 --> 23:48.244
So down with that.

23:48.279 --> 23:50.246
Yeah, good stuff.

23:50.281 --> 23:51.380
Okay, go, go.

23:51.415 --> 23:53.749
Oh, my God.

24:02.526 --> 24:03.692
Excuse me.

24:03.728 --> 24:04.928
I'm looking for Reg Whitehead.

24:04.929 --> 24:07.162
Oh, my God, Mr. Newman.

24:07.198 --> 24:08.864
It's Milo.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.767
I'm Milo; I'm the... the bass
guitar tech for the band.

24:11.802 --> 24:14.770
Look, it is just such an honor
to have you here with us.

24:14.805 --> 24:16.338
Just... gah.

24:16.374 --> 24:18.874
Are you the one I tore apart
in my little piece?

24:18.910 --> 24:20.609
To be trashed by Bryce Newman
is like being painted

24:20.645 --> 24:22.077
by Pablo Picasso.

24:22.113 --> 24:23.212
Good point.

24:23.247 --> 24:24.527
Please, Mr. Newman, have a seat.

24:24.548 --> 24:26.382
We have this lovely, lovely throne.

24:26.417 --> 24:27.917
I will get you Mr. Reg Whitehead.

24:27.952 --> 24:31.020
Did you know that my name
was not on the fucking list?

24:31.055 --> 24:34.356
Now, that hasn't happened to me
since 2008 at a Tom Waits show,

24:34.392 --> 24:36.625
which coincidentally, I
couldn't "wait" to miss.

24:36.661 --> 24:38.060
He's Billy Joel with bronchitis.

24:38.095 --> 24:39.561
I'll leave it at that.

24:39.597 --> 24:41.864
Your most eviscerating sentences
just make me shiver

24:41.899 --> 24:43.399
with delight, even when
they're about me.

24:43.434 --> 24:44.800
It's just...

24:44.835 --> 24:46.635
- Well, I went to Harvard.
- Good point.

24:46.671 --> 24:50.439
I mean, smart people are just
smarter than the rest of us.

24:50.474 --> 24:51.807
That is very true, Milo.

24:51.842 --> 24:53.742
My 15 year-old niece
could run Apple Computer

24:53.778 --> 24:55.210
better than Tim Cook.

24:56.981 --> 24:58.461
I'm gonna get you Reg Whitehead, okay?

24:58.482 --> 25:00.115
Okay, if you need something,
just... I'll be back.

25:00.151 --> 25:04.053
Thank you.

25:04.088 --> 25:06.422
Where's the girl?

25:06.457 --> 25:08.590
Where'd the girl go?

25:26.510 --> 25:28.077
Mmm, oh,

25:28.112 --> 25:32.781
your tongue feels amazing there.

25:32.817 --> 25:36.118
Oh! Oh, I love our dates, honey.

25:36.153 --> 25:38.420
What?

25:38.456 --> 25:40.122
Oh, yeah, yeah, my mouth too.

25:40.157 --> 25:42.491
Yeah, no, both places at the same time.

25:45.563 --> 25:48.630
<i>Shelli to 5. It's a Code 34.</i>

25:48.666 --> 25:50.833
One minute. Just give me a minute.

25:50.868 --> 25:53.302
<i>This is an emergency.
I need you, like, now.</i>

25:53.337 --> 25:55.304
<i>- What do you want?
- I need you now, Shelli.</i>

25:55.339 --> 25:57.339
Fuck.

26:04.048 --> 26:05.781
No.

26:07.018 --> 26:08.317
<i>Fuck, I-I got to go.</i>

26:08.352 --> 26:09.852
I-I am gonna so make this up to you.

26:09.887 --> 26:11.453
I'll call you tonight.

26:11.489 --> 26:13.822
I...

26:13.858 --> 26:16.725
Fuck.

26:16.761 --> 26:17.826
What?

26:17.862 --> 26:19.294
<i>Bryce Newman is here,</i>

26:19.330 --> 26:21.063
<i>and nobody is taking care of him.</i>

26:21.098 --> 26:25.334
<i>I had to leave him alone,
and Reg is nowhere to be found.</i>

26:25.369 --> 26:27.703
You called me for that?

26:27.738 --> 26:29.304
<i>Well, I just thought it was important.</i>

26:29.340 --> 26:32.841
That fucking blogger might
have just ended my marriage.

26:32.877 --> 26:35.177
Bryce Newman...

26:36.447 --> 26:37.371
Reg Whitehead.

26:37.654 --> 26:40.082
Thank you so much for gracing
us with your time and presence.

26:40.117 --> 26:41.984
I have a 9:50 flight to LA.

26:42.019 --> 26:44.420
Mm, that may be a little tight, Bryce,

26:44.455 --> 26:46.155
because the show starts at 9:00, so...

26:46.190 --> 26:48.157
Wh-wh-where do you like to watch
the show from generally?

26:48.192 --> 26:49.716
Where's the girl?

26:49.717 --> 26:51.727
Where is the... where's the...
where's the... well, I don't know.

26:51.762 --> 26:53.262
We're 19 minutes from the airport.

26:53.297 --> 26:55.931
I already have my ticket,
so I can endure three songs.

26:55.966 --> 26:57.599
Oh, that's fantastic.
That's such great news.

26:57.635 --> 27:00.936
Bryce, I can promise
you a grand adventure.

27:00.971 --> 27:03.939
Now, can I offer you
the best pastrami sandwich

27:03.974 --> 27:06.208
in Atlanta from the New Yorker Deli?

27:07.545 --> 27:09.211
Listen, Reg.

27:09.246 --> 27:12.548
Whatever you do or say or
present to me on this visit

27:12.583 --> 27:15.384
shall not alter my critical
analysis of this band,

27:15.419 --> 27:19.688
you understand, so I
will eat this sandwich

27:19.723 --> 27:21.390
if we have an agreement

27:21.425 --> 27:24.226
that there's no implicit quid pro quo.

27:24.261 --> 27:25.761
Absolutely, yeah, understood.

27:25.796 --> 27:27.896
There's also the French
sauce dip on the side.

27:27.932 --> 27:29.631
Not a fan of the band.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.867
Sandwich isn't gonna change that.

27:31.902 --> 27:33.902
So bon appétit.

27:33.938 --> 27:35.971
- Not changing my review.
- You enjoy it.

27:36.006 --> 27:37.873
- Not changing one word.
- Okay.

27:37.908 --> 27:40.542
Okay.

27:40.578 --> 27:42.544
It's just a sandwich.

27:42.580 --> 27:46.574
Just a sandwich.

27:59.130 --> 28:03.665
Bryce, this is the greatest coffee.

28:03.701 --> 28:05.968
You will want to write about it.

28:06.003 --> 28:07.736
I don't drink street coffee.

28:07.771 --> 28:09.004
I only drink it from a machine

28:09.039 --> 28:10.339
given to me by Howard Shultz.

28:10.374 --> 28:11.707
I trust you will love this.

28:20.384 --> 28:23.385
Very well.

28:39.537 --> 28:42.171
This is amazing.

28:42.206 --> 28:44.039
Mmm, mmm.

28:44.074 --> 28:47.709
I told you.

28:47.745 --> 28:51.547
Bryce, what's... what's
the state of the music business?

28:51.582 --> 28:54.016
What... what are you feeling?
What are you picking up?

28:54.051 --> 28:55.884
- Are you serious?
- Very, yes.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.719
I don't discuss the business
without it being a speech

28:57.755 --> 28:59.788
for which I am paid an honorarium.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.624
But because of this fucking coffee...

29:02.660 --> 29:06.728
in short, we are living in
an age of spectacle, not music,

29:06.764 --> 29:09.031
and everything you're looking
at is dead or dying,

29:09.066 --> 29:11.900
because, baby, if you even
have to ask me that question,

29:11.936 --> 29:14.636
"What's the state
of the music business?"

29:14.672 --> 29:17.172
Then you're an oldster, and you're dead.

29:18.542 --> 29:19.541
Hey.

29:21.779 --> 29:25.414
Hmm, check it out, prototype 7.

29:25.449 --> 29:26.815
Jony Ive gave it to me.

29:26.850 --> 29:28.884
I lose this thing, I'm a dead man.

29:28.919 --> 29:30.152
Another shot, Bryce?

29:30.187 --> 29:31.353
Fuck yeah.

29:31.388 --> 29:33.055
Go for Bryce.

29:44.768 --> 29:46.702
Here... here's your coffee.

29:46.737 --> 29:48.103
Thank you.

29:49.373 --> 29:50.772
Thank you.

29:53.477 --> 29:56.778
Hey, I love the poster.

29:56.814 --> 29:58.080
You know me, Bill.

29:58.115 --> 29:59.948
I-I do my best.

29:59.984 --> 30:01.783
And we've got a great crew, you know.

30:01.819 --> 30:04.753
We've got Wes, Kelly Ann,
my friend Milo here.

30:04.788 --> 30:06.955
This is for the setlist
when you're ready.

30:06.991 --> 30:09.424
Thank you, pleasure.

30:09.460 --> 30:13.095
Hey, by the way, where's Phil?

30:13.130 --> 30:14.363
Wh... uh...

30:14.398 --> 30:16.098
Phil got let go.

30:16.133 --> 30:17.432
- Yeah...
- Yeah, it...

30:17.468 --> 30:19.801
Fired.

30:19.837 --> 30:22.037
- Nobody fires Phil.
- Bro, it keeps me up at night.

30:22.072 --> 30:23.372
Please don't call him bro.

30:23.407 --> 30:25.407
You knew him a day, Wes.

30:25.442 --> 30:27.943
I can't wrap my head around firing Phil.

30:27.978 --> 30:30.112
The Staton-House Band fired Phil?

30:30.147 --> 30:32.214
Yeah.

30:32.249 --> 30:34.983
You see, there was an incident
with Hurricane Katrina.

30:35.019 --> 30:36.752
Bill, who made that mistake?

30:36.787 --> 30:38.320
Hi, guys. Hi. Hi. So sorry I'm late.

30:38.355 --> 30:39.488
Lindsey Buckingham, how are you?

30:39.523 --> 30:41.323
Such a huge fan. Oh, excuse me.

30:41.358 --> 30:44.826
Sorry, I know you're only here
for, uh, three shows, uh,

30:44.862 --> 30:46.161
as our special guest,

30:46.196 --> 30:48.630
but we are enormously appreciative.

30:48.666 --> 30:52.067
I'm here helping the band out
with some of their affairs.

30:52.102 --> 30:55.837
And I have been a loyal fan of yours

30:55.873 --> 30:58.974
ever since I saw you play at...

30:59.009 --> 31:03.178
or should I say "shred"...
at the Olympics.

31:03.213 --> 31:04.479
It was unbelievable.

31:04.515 --> 31:06.748
No, never played the Olympics.

31:06.784 --> 31:08.250
Well, I find that a crime.

31:08.285 --> 31:13.255
Can... may I also add
that aside from all the music,

31:13.290 --> 31:17.592
you've... monetized
your brand brilliantly.

31:17.628 --> 31:18.794
- Reg, my man...
- Yes.

31:18.829 --> 31:20.162
- Your guest is here.
- Good.

31:20.197 --> 31:22.531
- Thank you.
- Okay, pleasure upon pleasure.

31:22.566 --> 31:25.167
Let me know if there's anything
that I can do for you.

31:25.202 --> 31:27.035
- All right, then.
- Okay, he sat on this.

31:27.071 --> 31:29.938
Will you grab another... uh, he's new.

31:29.973 --> 31:32.941
Sorry.

31:39.683 --> 31:41.049
I'm, uh... I'm Milo.

31:41.085 --> 31:43.385
I'm gonna be helping
you out on the stage.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.987
"Bleed To Love Her," right?

31:46.023 --> 31:48.023
Yeah, still doing it.

31:48.058 --> 31:49.157
We're doing it tonight.

33:05.135 --> 33:07.135
Saw you with your camera in there.

33:07.171 --> 33:10.305
When sometimes memory isn't enough,

33:10.340 --> 33:14.576
you need a souvenir.

33:25.322 --> 33:29.090
<i>"Cassie, thank you for
what you said today.</i>

33:29.126 --> 33:32.727
<i>I'm really looking
forward to seeing you tonight."</i>

33:35.766 --> 33:37.332
Dictation, note to self,

33:37.367 --> 33:39.334
for next "Bryce Newman Letter."

33:39.369 --> 33:41.470
It's over. They're destroyed.

33:41.505 --> 33:43.839
They don't even get
that they've vaporized.

33:43.874 --> 33:48.410
Nicki Minaj is picking her
teeth with the bones of Bono

33:48.445 --> 33:52.080
and the other skeletons
of post-Gen Y culture.

33:52.115 --> 33:55.417
Jimmy lovine and
Apple Music and Tim Cook

33:55.452 --> 33:57.152
are on a canoe ride to mediocrity,

33:57.187 --> 33:59.421
and everyone under 50 knows it.

33:59.456 --> 34:02.491
And here I am with the
Staton-House Band.

34:02.526 --> 34:05.126
Take me home, Mr. Wizard.

34:05.162 --> 34:07.429
I am trapped in the land of mediocrity.

34:07.464 --> 34:09.797
The amber is starting to harden,

34:09.833 --> 34:14.803
and I need to get the fuck out.

34:14.838 --> 34:17.539
Oh, wow.

34:17.574 --> 34:19.608
Oh, that's good.

34:19.643 --> 34:21.275
I don't know if it's
the coffee or just me,

34:28.150 --> 34:30.619
There is no "hot" left in Hot 'Lanta.

34:30.654 --> 34:31.719
It should be
referred to as "Cold" Lanta.

34:31.755 --> 34:33.522
Is it happening yet?

34:33.556 --> 34:36.458
I'm not sure.

34:54.911 --> 34:57.345
Lindsey. Lindsey. Bryce Newman.

34:57.381 --> 34:58.647
Hi.

34:58.682 --> 35:00.382
I met you backstage
at the Hollywood Bowl

35:00.417 --> 35:03.084
after the last Mac tour with Irving.

35:03.120 --> 35:06.154
I did a "Bryce Newman Letter"
on "Seeds We Sow."

35:06.189 --> 35:10.559
You are a genius and make me weep.

35:10.594 --> 35:11.726
Oh, thank you.

35:11.762 --> 35:13.495
Thank you.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.897
Why are you playing this show?

35:15.933 --> 35:18.066
You can write a better song
on the back of a napkin

35:18.101 --> 35:21.670
than Christopher House has
in the last ten years.

35:21.705 --> 35:26.341
Ooh, heh, they must have
something on you.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.243
No, I'm... I'm friends with Bill Hanson,

35:28.278 --> 35:31.246
and I love the band.

35:31.281 --> 35:34.115
Lindsey, the truth is,
I just want the best.

35:34.151 --> 35:36.084
I don't want to waste my
time with the mediocre

35:36.119 --> 35:38.186
or even the very good.

35:38.221 --> 35:42.357
I am searching for...

35:42.392 --> 35:44.259
long little rodents.

35:44.294 --> 35:45.694
Ooh, they're everywhere.

35:46.763 --> 35:47.796
Here we go.

35:47.831 --> 35:48.863
'Bout time.

35:48.899 --> 35:51.399
Everywhere.

35:51.435 --> 35:53.768
Pardon me?

35:53.804 --> 35:55.103
Greatness.

35:55.138 --> 35:56.204
Are you okay?

36:01.612 --> 36:03.445
You're on fire.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.600
Thank you.

36:06.850 --> 36:10.051
Well...

36:10.087 --> 36:11.386
Bend me over and mount me

36:11.421 --> 36:13.922
like a medieval alpaca,
Lindsey Buckingham.

36:16.593 --> 36:18.593
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:18.629 --> 36:23.231

talking about, Reg.

37:58.628 --> 38:00.061
He's fucking lost, and I hear
he's been given heavy drugs.

38:00.097 --> 38:02.897
You need to get a handle
on your crew now.

38:02.933 --> 38:04.499
Reg, raise your voice to me again,

38:04.534 --> 38:06.701
you won't be speaking for a while.

38:06.737 --> 38:09.237

38:31.094 --> 38:33.261
We must never be apart.

38:33.296 --> 38:34.929
Come back, dark angel.

38:34.965 --> 38:37.198
Come back, dark angel!

38:43.807 --> 38:45.406
Oh, yes.

38:54.351 --> 38:55.717
I speak English.

38:55.752 --> 38:56.885

39:02.125 --> 39:04.125
With your permission, Tasty Jose,

39:04.161 --> 39:05.927
may I become you?

39:05.962 --> 39:08.763
Señor Bryce, before
I grant you this wish,

39:08.799 --> 39:11.065
you must repent and beg for the mercy

39:11.101 --> 39:14.469
of Apple Music and Apple CEO Tim Cook,

39:14.504 --> 39:16.004
who you have criticized so.

39:16.039 --> 39:18.773
Very well.

39:18.809 --> 39:19.908
Your wish shall be granted.

39:23.013 --> 39:26.014
Forgive me, Tim Cook.

39:28.151 --> 39:29.517
May I become you?

39:29.553 --> 39:30.585
No, Bryce.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.787
How easily you betray me.

39:32.823 --> 39:35.857
I cast you to the wilderness
of eternal doubt and darkness.

39:37.994 --> 39:39.861
I'm lost, Tim Cook.

39:39.896 --> 39:42.430
I understand, but if you were
wearing your Apple Watch,

39:42.465 --> 39:44.032
you wouldn't be.

39:44.067 --> 39:47.502
Ahh, yes.

39:47.537 --> 39:49.470
Thank you, great innovator.

41:16.893 --> 41:19.060
Eureka. I'm bringing him in.

41:25.936 --> 41:27.902
We should go.

41:29.272 --> 41:30.872
Is it time?

41:30.907 --> 41:32.140
Oh, yeah.

41:39.149 --> 41:40.648
<i>Who did this to him?</i>

41:40.684 --> 41:42.984
All I know is, Tom
and Christopher are here,

41:43.019 --> 41:45.887
and they are not happy
Bryce Newman is in the building.

41:45.922 --> 41:47.555
I am the Staton-House Band.

41:47.590 --> 41:49.457
Oh, fucking hell.

41:49.492 --> 41:51.326
You know, Reg, I can't help
it if someone on the crew

41:51.361 --> 41:53.127
or the whole crew did this to him.

41:53.163 --> 41:55.330
Okay, this was your idea, remember?

41:55.365 --> 41:56.685
"Lead with sugar.

41:56.700 --> 41:57.832
Make him feel like a king."

41:57.867 --> 41:59.334
Remember, that was your rap.

41:59.369 --> 42:00.969
I didn't say rearrange
his fucking chromosomes.

42:01.004 --> 42:03.271
Okay, at a certain point,
buddy... yeah, yeah, you ready?

42:03.306 --> 42:05.139
All right, all right,
hey, Bill, Bill, Bill...

42:05.175 --> 42:06.574
No, this is it, Reg.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.609
This is not Bill's fault, okay?

42:08.645 --> 42:09.944
It was your brother who did this,

42:09.980 --> 42:11.746
and I want him fired, okay?

42:11.781 --> 42:12.914
No, 'cause you're just trying
to get me back for what you

42:12.949 --> 42:14.515
still think I did to get you fired.

42:14.551 --> 42:15.850
Please... please, I didn't
take that seriously.

42:15.885 --> 42:17.785
Jesus, get a room, you two.

42:17.821 --> 42:20.321
And you can't fire Wes, 'cause
he just got fired by Pearl Jam.

42:20.357 --> 42:21.823
Plus, we can't fire him,

42:21.858 --> 42:23.358
because he's the
best nanny we've ever had.

42:23.393 --> 42:25.126
<i>- Winston fucking loves him.
- Whoo!</i>

42:25.161 --> 42:27.595
Lindsey fucking
Buckingham was fucking amazing.

42:27.630 --> 42:30.298
Wow.

42:30.333 --> 42:31.766
What did I do?

42:31.801 --> 42:34.302
Reg thinks there's a conspiracy
against Bryce

42:34.337 --> 42:35.436
spearheaded by you.

42:35.472 --> 42:37.772
That's what's going on, Wes.

42:37.807 --> 42:39.640
I thought that's what you wanted, Reg.

42:39.676 --> 42:41.542
Sexual assault, exotic hallucinogens,

42:41.578 --> 42:43.111
shame, and humiliation? No, Wes!

42:43.146 --> 42:46.114
It's not what I fucking wanted!

42:46.149 --> 42:47.348
He'll be writing about this for a year.

42:47.384 --> 42:49.884
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

42:49.919 --> 42:51.052
<i>People.</i>

42:51.087 --> 42:52.553
What the fuck is that?

42:52.589 --> 42:54.069
<i>Check one two, check one two.</i>

42:54.090 --> 42:55.050
Who's out there?

42:55.058 --> 42:56.024
<i>Hello.</i>

42:56.059 --> 42:57.458
<i>Hello.</i>

42:57.494 --> 42:59.494
My name is Bryce Newman.

43:03.533 --> 43:05.333
I write "The Bryce Newman Letter."

43:07.270 --> 43:08.636
I'm 52 years old,

43:08.671 --> 43:10.538
and I wear the clothes of a teenager.

43:13.243 --> 43:16.244
Ohh!

43:16.279 --> 43:17.812
M-maybe you should get...

43:17.847 --> 43:19.207
Hey, Puna, where the fuck are you?

43:19.215 --> 43:21.382
I hardly even went to college.

43:24.421 --> 43:28.189
And my real name isn't Bryce Newman.

43:28.224 --> 43:29.390
<i>- What's your name?
- Hey, Bryce.</i>

43:29.426 --> 43:31.159
Newbert Billingsley.

43:31.194 --> 43:32.860
Tell Milo to hold off.
Ju... hold off for a second.

43:32.896 --> 43:36.230
Newbert Alfred Billingsley.

43:38.735 --> 43:40.535
Why can't I suck my own dick?

43:42.872 --> 43:44.272
I mean, monkeys do.

43:44.307 --> 43:45.773
What did you give that guy?

43:45.809 --> 43:48.910
I don't even listen to
the music I review.

43:48.945 --> 43:52.113
I listen to dad rock in the car
and switch over to hip-hop

43:52.148 --> 43:55.583
if someone cool pulls up next to me.

43:55.618 --> 43:58.553
I am a fraud!

44:01.057 --> 44:06.060
The hammer of the gods
will drive us to new lands!

44:08.298 --> 44:12.100
This is who I am.

44:21.845 --> 44:25.913
Okay, get 'im.

44:25.949 --> 44:27.482
Excuse me, Puna's two minutes away.

44:27.517 --> 44:28.816
Okay.

44:57.881 --> 45:00.781
He's got kind of a James
Brown type quality.

45:06.890 --> 45:08.422
I love you, Chicago!

45:15.965 --> 45:16.931
Atlanta.

45:18.701 --> 45:20.368
Bryce, I think you made your point.

45:22.305 --> 45:25.206
I have become the Staton-House Band.

45:25.241 --> 45:28.109
Welcome me to your stage.

45:33.082 --> 45:35.583
He's off the stage.

45:58.007 --> 46:00.541
Hello, Atlanta.

46:00.577 --> 46:02.410
The fuck was that?

46:02.445 --> 46:03.844
<i>Where's the girl?</i>

46:03.880 --> 46:06.013
Mutt Lange, meet Tim Cook.

46:06.049 --> 46:08.649
Tasty Jose.

46:08.685 --> 46:09.483
Def Leppard.

46:09.519 --> 46:11.052
Excuse me, folks.

46:11.087 --> 46:12.920
<i>I've got him here
with me. Where are you?</i>

46:12.956 --> 46:14.922
There go your tour proceeds.

46:14.958 --> 46:17.825
He can claim physical abuse now too.

46:17.860 --> 46:21.495
Bill, Wes is a liability,
and so is his sister.

46:21.531 --> 46:24.332
As far as I'm concerned,
they should both go home.

46:24.367 --> 46:26.734
Hey, why don't you go ahead and
fire me while you're at it, Reg?

46:26.769 --> 46:28.502
Okay, look, I run the crew, all right?

46:28.538 --> 46:30.338
Try it. See how that works out.
Go ahead. Give it a try.

46:30.373 --> 46:33.507
Bill, Bill, Bill...

46:33.543 --> 46:36.577
it's you or me, but he's got to go.

46:44.821 --> 46:47.421
- Hey, hey, Hot 'Lanta, huh? 
- Hey-hey.

46:47.457 --> 46:48.756
How 'bout it?

46:48.791 --> 46:50.591
Hi, Stan.

46:50.627 --> 46:53.394
Hi.

46:53.429 --> 46:55.896
Quite a town.

46:55.932 --> 46:57.298
- Bill...
- Yeah.

46:57.333 --> 46:58.866
I have to leave.

46:58.901 --> 47:00.635
- No.
- I have a family.

47:00.670 --> 47:02.703
This is my time off.

47:02.739 --> 47:04.105
It's been fun.

47:04.140 --> 47:05.873
What was it? Is it 'cause
the guy got dosed?

47:05.908 --> 47:07.408
'Cause we're not so sure
that was one of our crew guys

47:07.443 --> 47:08.609
that did that.

47:08.645 --> 47:10.278
I'm all for having a good time,

47:10.313 --> 47:13.247
but this tour is like a Fellini film

47:13.283 --> 47:16.317
<i>crossed with an episode of The Monkees.</i>

47:16.352 --> 47:19.553
And I mean that in the
best way, but I-I can't stay.

47:19.589 --> 47:21.122
It's not always like this, Lindsey.

47:21.157 --> 47:22.390
This was just a bad night.

47:22.425 --> 47:23.724
I love you.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.559
I love you too.

47:25.595 --> 47:29.997
As time goes by, I
may say it less and less,

47:30.033 --> 47:32.266
but I mean it more.

47:32.302 --> 47:33.901
Me too.

47:33.936 --> 47:35.736
So you take care of yourself.

47:35.772 --> 47:37.505
- Okay.
- All right.

47:37.540 --> 47:41.509
Thanks.

47:41.544 --> 47:45.146
The "can't say no" favor now
officially belongs to you, man.

47:45.181 --> 47:47.248
You look good.

47:47.283 --> 47:49.317
No, you actually do look good.

47:49.352 --> 47:50.751
You look great.

47:50.787 --> 47:51.819
- Thank you so much.
- All right, all right.

47:51.854 --> 47:53.621
I do owe you. Thanks, Lindsey.

47:53.656 --> 47:54.655
I'll be in touch.

47:54.691 --> 47:55.856
Okay.

47:55.892 --> 47:58.259
But you never should have fired Phil.

47:58.294 --> 48:01.262
Yeah, yeah.

48:01.297 --> 48:03.164
Night, Stan. Thank you.

48:06.235 --> 48:07.601

Come on, Bill.

48:22.085 --> 48:25.386
Dionne with the man bun?

48:38.267 --> 48:40.668
Fuck.

50:08.357 --> 50:11.492
<i>Don't do so much dairy."</i>

50:32.882 --> 50:34.181
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:34.217 --> 50:36.650
Don't go. Leave her with something.

50:36.686 --> 50:41.655
Just text her and tell her,
"I'll remember you like this,

50:41.691 --> 50:45.125
the most beautiful painting in Atlanta,

50:46.462 --> 50:48.863
Yeah?

50:50.366 --> 50:51.599
"In the..."

50:51.634 --> 50:54.368
"In Atlanta, maybe the world."

51:17.426 --> 51:18.659
- There's your souvenir.
- Yep.

51:25.902 --> 51:29.036
Nice work, Cyrano.

51:29.071 --> 51:31.472
That's not bad.

51:31.507 --> 51:33.641
I might like that nickname.

51:37.213 --> 51:41.315
Okay, Gooch, let's head to Nashville.

51:43.686 --> 51:47.755
So pretty.

51:47.790 --> 51:51.025
Each one kills you in a different way.

52:10.580 --> 52:13.747
<i>Uh-oh, it's a new
"Bryce Newman Letter."</i>

52:13.783 --> 52:16.283

It has incredible Wi-Fi,

post-Steve Jobs infrastructure

I'll keep this memory close."

54:10.099 --> 54:13.901
He never even saw the show.

54:13.936 --> 54:18.539
But the important
thing is, he thinks he did.

Jesus.
