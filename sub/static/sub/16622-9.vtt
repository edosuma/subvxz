00:01.050 --> 00:02.620
Previously on "Secrets and Lies"...

00:02.630 --> 00:04.613
I had to travel when
you kids were young.

00:04.623 --> 00:06.547
Do you have any idea
what it was like for us

00:06.557 --> 00:07.723
while you were away?

00:07.725 --> 00:09.291
Where were you this past week?

00:09.301 --> 00:10.559
Out of town on business.

00:10.561 --> 00:12.850
I'm here about Dad.
I think he may have cancer.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.068
He's got a second phone,

00:14.078 --> 00:15.780
and a cancer center called him on it.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.650
S.E.G. owns a whorehouse?

00:17.660 --> 00:19.193
Melanie Warner, you're under arrest.

00:20.017 --> 00:21.958
- You're under arrest.
- You put me here.

00:21.968 --> 00:23.067
Your actions did that.

00:23.069 --> 00:24.935
I received this... Blackmail.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.804
Kate paid the money
without even telling me.

00:26.806 --> 00:28.405
What makes you think it was Patrick?

00:28.407 --> 00:29.507
Who else would've done this?

00:29.509 --> 00:32.610
The transponder Kate planted
on the money is on the move.

00:32.612 --> 00:34.227
This could be your guy.

00:44.552 --> 00:46.257
What the hell?

00:46.588 --> 00:48.259
You think your father's extorting you?

00:48.473 --> 00:49.727
No. That's ridiculous.

00:49.729 --> 00:52.530
Somebody blackmailed you,
Kate paid them,

00:52.532 --> 00:54.198
put a transponder in with the money,

00:54.200 --> 00:56.300
and we followed the tracking device,

00:56.302 --> 00:58.331
175 miles from where you live, here.

00:58.341 --> 01:00.004
In the middle of the night... I get it.

01:00.006 --> 01:02.846
But my father has no reason to blackmail
me. He doesn't need the money.

01:02.856 --> 01:05.806
All right. Did you tell
him about the extortion?

01:08.186 --> 01:11.048
Not until this morning.

01:11.050 --> 01:14.285
Well, then, he's involved somehow.

01:16.133 --> 01:18.051
And if the blackmailer
killed Kate, then...

01:18.061 --> 01:19.623
Please stop talking.

01:29.082 --> 01:30.827
That money's still in that building.

01:30.837 --> 01:32.188
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

01:32.198 --> 01:33.998
Getting what I came for. I want answers.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.633
Well, there's no one in there to give
them to you, man. Use your head.

01:36.635 --> 01:38.268
Says the guy who punches first
and asks questions later.

01:38.270 --> 01:40.542
Hey, hey, hey! Those are
security contacts, right there.

01:40.552 --> 01:41.939
System's state of the art, okay?

01:41.941 --> 01:43.207
You got to think, all right?

01:43.209 --> 01:45.376
We'll come back tomorrow
morning when they're open.

01:45.378 --> 01:47.011
- No.
- Look!

01:47.013 --> 01:49.847
I'm looking for my daughter,
and I am not gonna go down

01:49.849 --> 01:51.548
because you turned into the Hulk.

01:52.585 --> 01:55.119
The cops show up, I'm gonna bail.

01:55.121 --> 01:57.450
- I'm not leaving.
- Fine.

01:58.657 --> 01:59.890
But I'm driving.

01:59.892 --> 02:01.453
I'm out of here, man.

02:18.116 --> 02:21.954
Look, you want to calm
down and ask me if I have a plan?

02:22.201 --> 02:25.682
All right, the best way to get
answers is to ask the right person.

02:25.684 --> 02:28.685
My father's already lied to me
about a second phone and cancer.

02:28.687 --> 02:30.621
What makes you think he's gonna
tell me the truth about this?

02:30.623 --> 02:32.423
I didn't mean him, okay?

02:32.425 --> 02:35.025
The blackmailer knows who you are,

02:35.027 --> 02:37.461
so tomorrow morning,
when R.B. Trucking opens,

02:37.463 --> 02:40.497
I'm gonna go in, do some recon,
collect some intel.

02:40.499 --> 02:42.022
I don't... I don't get you.

02:42.032 --> 02:44.168
When you want answers, you just...
you just beat the crap

02:44.170 --> 02:47.270
- out of whoever's in your path.
- That's not true.

02:47.866 --> 02:50.874
Okay? I watched you and Kate for days

02:50.876 --> 02:54.078
before I decided she was my best hope,

02:54.080 --> 02:57.047
because she was the one
shopping for baby clothes.

02:57.049 --> 02:58.882
Turns out I was right.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.885
I did the same thing with Liam and Neil.

03:01.887 --> 03:03.320
I can't.

03:03.322 --> 03:06.924
I can't just sit around here
till morning and do nothing.

03:06.926 --> 03:08.392
You got no choice.

03:08.394 --> 03:10.127
Okay, between Cornell

03:10.129 --> 03:13.097
and the investigation into your company,

03:13.099 --> 03:15.225
you got enough trouble.

03:15.639 --> 03:18.202
Do you want answers...

03:18.902 --> 03:20.802
or the cell next to Patrick?

03:37.044 --> 03:39.389
Your package from
the private lab arrived.

03:39.391 --> 03:40.624
Care to explain this?

03:40.626 --> 03:44.027
Kate Warner had a charge from the
private lab on her credit card.

03:44.029 --> 03:46.897
We got a warrant for the materials
she had tested and the results.

03:46.899 --> 03:48.999
Well, the lead panned out.

03:49.001 --> 03:52.703
Eric Warner was being
blackmailed for 100 grand.

03:52.705 --> 03:55.606
Well, then, whoever extorted
Eric could've killed Kate.

03:55.608 --> 03:59.877
Begs the question why Eric didn't
hand this letter over right away.

03:59.879 --> 04:02.016
Maybe he wasn't aware right away.

04:02.026 --> 04:04.047
I think the reason Eric was unaware

04:04.049 --> 04:06.717
that his wife took 100K from his savings

04:06.719 --> 04:09.219
is because she paid the
blackmailer without telling him.

04:09.221 --> 04:10.609
Why wouldn't she tell him?

04:10.619 --> 04:13.657
Either he didn't take it seriously
or he refused to be intimidated.

04:13.659 --> 04:15.025
Kate had to know paying the money

04:15.027 --> 04:16.593
wasn't gonna make the
blackmailer go away.

04:16.595 --> 04:18.695
That's why she had her ex Shane Campbell

04:18.697 --> 04:20.731
install the tracking
software on her iPad.

04:20.733 --> 04:23.700
The GPS with the cash pings
the software when it moves.

04:23.702 --> 04:26.236
Kate was trying to follow the
money to the blackmailer.

04:26.238 --> 04:28.839
What the hell did she think she
was gonna do when she found him?

04:28.841 --> 04:30.841
Well, if she did find him,
he could've killed her.

04:30.843 --> 04:32.260
So, how do we find this guy?

04:32.270 --> 04:34.745
This letter is threatening to expose

04:34.747 --> 04:36.847
Eric Warner's juvenile record.

04:36.849 --> 04:39.483
So the blackmailer had to
be in possession of it.

04:39.485 --> 04:41.919
Amanda Warner said her
father had the only copy.

04:41.921 --> 04:43.587
And he has yet to turn it over.

04:43.589 --> 04:44.821
So either he's hiding it

04:44.823 --> 04:47.129
or he's hiding the fact
that it's missing.

04:47.139 --> 04:49.274
I don't care who John
Warner's friends are.

04:49.284 --> 04:50.704
Go shake his tree.

04:51.766 --> 04:54.431
The DNA results in
there might help, too.

04:54.433 --> 04:55.799
DNA results?

05:08.176 --> 05:10.847
What you got?

05:12.517 --> 05:16.386
Magazine cutouts... How very 1973.

05:16.388 --> 05:20.023
No fingerprints found
on the blackmail letter?

05:20.025 --> 05:23.275
Right. But whoever licked
the envelope left their DNA.

05:24.796 --> 05:26.263
My god.

05:27.832 --> 05:29.270
I know this guy.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.354
This is random S.T.R.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.203
What the hell am I
supposed to do with that?

05:33.205 --> 05:36.684
I want you to run it through the
system, compare it to all this.

05:36.694 --> 05:40.344
I think Eric Warner's blackmailer
is a member of his family.

05:45.316 --> 05:47.539
I wish I was hiring,

05:47.549 --> 05:50.989
but last few months,
I had to let people go.

05:50.999 --> 05:53.357
Yeah, economy's for crap, man.

05:53.359 --> 05:55.308
Yeah, I even got rid of the secretary.

05:58.997 --> 06:00.230
I got to take this.

06:00.232 --> 06:01.898
Sure, man all right, thank you.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.166
- Thanks anyway.
- Yeah, you got it.

06:03.168 --> 06:04.902
It's good meeting you.

06:04.912 --> 06:06.483
This is R.B.

06:41.699 --> 06:42.855
What'd you find out?

06:42.865 --> 06:45.075
You got any relatives here in Georgia?

06:45.714 --> 06:46.977
No.

06:46.979 --> 06:48.345
I just met the owner, R.B.,

06:48.347 --> 06:50.480
and he's giving out pink slips,
having money problems,

06:50.482 --> 06:53.917
and I'm pretty sure he got the
juvie file to blackmail you

06:53.919 --> 06:55.428
from your father.

06:56.688 --> 06:58.651
How you figure?

06:58.766 --> 07:02.127
Well, 'cause his full name
is Robert Brian Warner.

07:03.695 --> 07:05.067
He had this.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.391
This is a blanket warrant.

07:19.401 --> 07:20.501
You understand?

07:20.503 --> 07:22.770
- So do not waste it.
- You know I won't.

07:22.772 --> 07:25.364
- Ken, thank you.
- What's up, Cornell?

07:25.849 --> 07:27.349
I'm looking for John Warner.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.942
Too late. Patrick Warner just got bail.

07:28.944 --> 07:31.249
He's probably posting bond right now.

07:32.259 --> 07:33.781
Hey.

07:33.783 --> 07:35.582
I just wanted to thank you.

07:35.584 --> 07:36.917
For Melanie's necklace.

07:36.919 --> 07:39.019
Ever since that footage
started to make its rounds,

07:39.021 --> 07:40.954
every single person's been
bending over backwards

07:40.956 --> 07:42.956
- to help me with my case.
- Of course they are.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.324
Too many high-powered men on tape.

07:44.326 --> 07:45.993
Judges don't want to look like
they're protecting anyone.

07:45.995 --> 07:48.629
Right now, it doesn't look like
S.E.G. owns any other brothels,

07:48.631 --> 07:51.565
but, thanks to Turk, I got a
blanket warrant just to make sure

07:51.567 --> 07:53.767
the rest of the Warners
are keeping it clean.

07:53.769 --> 07:55.202
Thanks.

07:55.204 --> 07:56.937
How we doing with the
Kate Warner homicide?

07:56.939 --> 07:59.039
The investigation is ongoing.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.041
Well, it's been three weeks,
so you must have something.

08:01.043 --> 08:02.543
I'm not talking to you

08:02.545 --> 08:05.533
until I have solid
evidence and a confession.

08:07.615 --> 08:10.256
You're just a cog in the wheel, Cornell.

08:10.494 --> 08:12.753
I'll get my update from your boss.

08:16.024 --> 08:17.624
Have you heard from Eric?

08:17.626 --> 08:18.826
No.

08:18.828 --> 08:20.594
He's not answering any of my calls.

08:20.596 --> 08:22.996
- Well, I mean...
- Mr. Warner.

08:22.998 --> 08:24.198
What do you want?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.400
Can't this wait?

08:26.402 --> 08:28.035
I've waited long enough.

08:28.037 --> 08:29.870
Where's Eric's juvenile file?

08:29.872 --> 08:31.772
I don't know, but I'll keep looking.

08:31.774 --> 08:33.674
Any idea the last time you saw it?

08:33.676 --> 08:35.442
Maybe in your office or your home?

08:35.443 --> 08:37.410
Why is this so important?

08:37.413 --> 08:39.679
Maybe your car? Perhaps it was stolen.

08:39.682 --> 08:41.715
It probably got filed incorrectly

08:41.717 --> 08:44.451
with the paperwork at S.E.G.
What is your issue?

08:44.453 --> 08:46.286
It's odd that such a sensitive document

08:46.288 --> 08:48.380
would be handled so carelessly.

08:48.390 --> 08:52.122
Surely you wouldn't want it
to fall into the wrong hands.

08:53.917 --> 08:58.073
Any idea why your best friend
would use a private DNA lab?

08:59.332 --> 09:00.601
I don't know. Maybe it has to do

09:00.603 --> 09:02.648
with the son that she
put up for adoption.

09:02.658 --> 09:06.187
It's funny... your brother
Eric said the same thing.

09:14.782 --> 09:16.183
Look, if his name's Warner,

09:16.185 --> 09:18.285
he's got to be some kind of relative.

09:18.287 --> 09:20.020
- That I never met?
- I don't know.

09:20.022 --> 09:22.222
A distant, screwed-up
cousin or something?

09:22.224 --> 09:24.091
Doesn't make sense how he
got ahold of my juvie file.

09:24.093 --> 09:26.793
My dad wouldn't just give it to
him. The guy must've stolen it.

09:26.795 --> 09:29.796
Yeah, you know what? Why...
Why'd your dad even have it?

09:29.798 --> 09:31.265
I mean, you decked a guy 20 years ago,

09:31.267 --> 09:33.066
- so wouldn't it be shredded by now?
- It should have been.

09:33.068 --> 09:35.102
I didn't even know it existed
until seven months ago.

09:35.104 --> 09:37.104
How's that?

09:37.106 --> 09:38.639
The lawyer that defended me died.

09:38.649 --> 09:41.875
His firm sent all client paperwork
back to the address on file.

09:41.877 --> 09:43.443
What, your dad's house?

09:43.445 --> 09:45.078
Yeah. My father brought
it into the office

09:45.080 --> 09:47.281
and asked me if I wanted to keep it.

09:47.283 --> 09:49.249
At the time, I was about
to propose to Kate.

09:49.251 --> 09:50.817
I didn't want to think about that.

09:50.819 --> 09:52.920
So he said he'd hang onto it.

09:52.922 --> 09:56.056
Well, you need to find out your
dad's connection to this guy.

09:56.058 --> 09:58.492
Why didn't I think
of that? Thank you.

09:58.494 --> 10:00.394
Yeah, by searching the Internet?

10:00.396 --> 10:03.616
While you're at it, maybe ask
Siri who blackmailed you.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.676
Look,

10:07.506 --> 10:09.882
S.E.G.'s software goes deeper.

10:09.892 --> 10:13.704
It's how we find out about
companies before we take them over.

10:13.792 --> 10:15.398
All right.

10:15.911 --> 10:18.605
R.B. Trucking company's
articles of incorporation show

10:18.615 --> 10:20.981
that there's a Corinne
Warner on the board.

10:20.983 --> 10:22.716
She's right around the
same age as my dad,

10:22.718 --> 10:24.184
but she lives right here in town.

10:24.186 --> 10:26.920
So she's, what, R.B.'s mom or something?

10:26.922 --> 10:29.523
Whoever she is, maybe she can tell me

10:29.525 --> 10:31.391
how my father knows R.B.

10:31.393 --> 10:33.527
Undercover work.

10:33.529 --> 10:35.300
What are you gonna say?

10:48.176 --> 10:49.870
That's not my case.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.546
Well, the world doesn't
revolve around you.

10:52.548 --> 10:55.695
You have the answers for
that DNA from the envelope?

10:56.951 --> 10:58.909
Scored a partial match.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.102
To whom?

11:01.127 --> 11:02.923
Eric Warner.

11:02.925 --> 11:04.519
And Amanda.

11:04.854 --> 11:05.932
And Patrick.

11:05.942 --> 11:08.495
So the blackmailer is
related to the Warners.

11:08.497 --> 11:10.630
He is.

11:10.973 --> 11:13.467
And the DNA comparison, it tells us how.

11:23.038 --> 11:24.627
Is this all of it?

11:24.759 --> 11:28.548
That's everything your key
witnesses provided for testing.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.565
That's not the right jacket.

11:49.270 --> 11:50.504
Can I help you?

11:50.506 --> 11:52.105
Corinne Warner?

11:52.107 --> 11:53.673
Hi. I'm Eric.

11:53.675 --> 11:55.542
I'm a business associate of John's.

11:55.544 --> 11:57.377
He... he's in town and
he told me to stop by,

11:57.379 --> 11:58.866
but I don't see his S.U.V.

11:58.876 --> 12:01.381
He's on his way back with my son.

12:01.383 --> 12:03.917
You mean R.B.?

12:05.686 --> 12:07.421
Would you like to come in and wait?

12:07.423 --> 12:09.923
I'm sure he'd love to catch up.

12:09.925 --> 12:11.216
Why not?

12:11.469 --> 12:13.794
I'm sure we have a lot to talk about.

12:21.394 --> 12:26.285
I was just about to make some lemonade.

12:27.123 --> 12:28.608
Would you like some?

12:28.610 --> 12:30.143
I don't... I don't want to impose.

12:30.145 --> 12:33.720
It's no trouble.

12:58.673 --> 13:01.059
How long have you known John?

13:04.278 --> 13:08.115
I don't usually meet my
husband's co-workers

13:08.117 --> 13:09.649
since he's always on the road.

13:13.156 --> 13:16.156
He promised to travel less now.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.959
Well, maybe I'll get to see more of him.

13:27.368 --> 13:30.169
How closely do you work with John?

13:52.659 --> 13:53.792
Hi.

13:53.802 --> 13:57.497
I need to know if John Warner
made any recent phone calls.

13:57.499 --> 13:59.261
My blanket warrant does give me access

13:59.271 --> 14:02.275
to everything Warner and S.E.G.
What are you looking for?

14:02.285 --> 14:04.114
Well, someone used
Eric's juvenile record

14:04.124 --> 14:06.758
to blackmail him,
and John had the only copy.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.228
I paid him a visit, so now his next step

14:09.230 --> 14:11.483
will be to warn the extortionist.

14:11.493 --> 14:13.999
- Why would he warn them?
- Because it's his other son.

14:14.001 --> 14:15.434
- Patrick?
- No.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.008
The one no one knows about.

14:19.372 --> 14:20.405
Okay.

14:21.809 --> 14:25.544
So, we got two phone calls to a
cellphone in Augusta, Georgia.

14:25.546 --> 14:28.413
And he's there right now,
but that makes sense.

14:28.415 --> 14:29.515
Why?

14:29.517 --> 14:31.850
Well, because he owns
a house in Augusta.

14:31.852 --> 14:33.071
Since when?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.287
December 1971.

14:36.523 --> 14:39.525
I'll text you that address right now.

14:43.224 --> 14:44.863
This is nice.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.131
What is?

14:46.133 --> 14:49.134
Since so much of John's
business is out of town,

14:49.136 --> 14:51.877
it's rare I get to meet his colleagues.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.009
- I-I should go.
- Don't do that.

14:57.011 --> 14:58.210
He'll be back in a moment.

14:58.212 --> 14:59.778
I just... I just don't want to intrude.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.381
Don't be silly.
I'm glad for the company.

15:07.820 --> 15:10.422
So, tell me a little about yourself.

15:11.028 --> 15:13.145
How long have you been married?

15:15.596 --> 15:17.500
One second.

15:17.510 --> 15:18.823
_

15:20.984 --> 15:23.402
Oh. There you are.

15:30.224 --> 15:31.843
Eric was just about to tell me...

15:31.845 --> 15:34.005
- Shouldn't you be resting?
- I'm fine.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.786
I think this is yours.

15:49.529 --> 15:51.663
Eric and I have...
We have some work to discuss,

15:51.665 --> 15:53.965
so we're gonna get out of your way.

15:56.102 --> 15:58.971
It was nice meeting you, Eric.

16:03.042 --> 16:05.077
Nice meeting you, too.

16:10.117 --> 16:12.117
- Lying son of a bitch.
- Eric, calm down.

16:12.119 --> 16:13.452
How long have you been married to her?

16:13.454 --> 16:15.454
This is not the time or
place to talk about...

16:15.456 --> 16:17.656
You don't get to dictate terms anymore.

16:17.658 --> 16:20.202
- Ever. Do you understand?
- You're angry. You have a right to be.

16:20.212 --> 16:21.760
Shut your mouth.

16:21.762 --> 16:24.029
This isn't some problem
that can just be fixed

16:24.031 --> 16:26.198
if we just look at it
from the right angle.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.334
You have two wives, two families.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.803
Everything... Every single thing...
You've ever told me is a lie.

16:31.805 --> 16:33.405
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:33.407 --> 16:34.940
You come to my mother's house?

16:34.942 --> 16:36.408
And how did I get here?

16:36.410 --> 16:37.909
She's dying.

16:42.949 --> 16:44.916
- When were you born?
- Eric...

16:44.918 --> 16:46.551
Don't touch me.

16:46.553 --> 16:48.320
I came first.

16:48.322 --> 16:49.588
I'm the oldest son.

16:49.590 --> 16:51.556
I'm the one he's supposed
to pass on his legacy to,

16:51.558 --> 16:52.791
the one he's supposed to care about.

16:52.793 --> 16:54.626
You're a criminal.

16:54.628 --> 16:56.328
From what I read, so are you.

16:56.330 --> 16:57.654
Will you both please just stop this?

16:57.664 --> 17:00.198
I'm begging you.
Corinne hasn't hurt anyone.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.200
We...

17:05.117 --> 17:06.415
It's okay.

17:07.306 --> 17:08.740
Why are you here?

17:08.742 --> 17:10.541
To find out if you killed my wife

17:10.544 --> 17:12.044
and to get my money back.

17:12.046 --> 17:15.347
I didn't go near your damn wife,
and I was owed that money.

17:15.348 --> 17:16.615
- How?
- I got a good look

17:16.617 --> 17:18.950
at how some of the Warners
live high on the hog.

17:18.952 --> 17:21.520
He spent money on you and
left me out in the cold.

17:21.521 --> 17:24.156
I took care of you, always.

17:24.157 --> 17:26.886
You had food. You had a home.
You had two parents who loved you.

17:26.896 --> 17:30.550
- You were never here.
- He was... half the time.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.364
Robert, you're a grown man,

17:32.366 --> 17:34.350
but you have never acted like one.

17:34.360 --> 17:35.701
I sent you to college, you dropped out.

17:35.703 --> 17:37.903
I started your company,
you ran it into the ground.

17:37.905 --> 17:40.659
You help strangers.
You could've helped me fix it.

17:40.669 --> 17:43.642
I tried! I gave you more money.
I gave you a plan.

17:43.644 --> 17:46.178
- But you never listen.
- You gave him everything!

17:46.180 --> 17:47.869
I worked hard for what I have.

17:48.248 --> 17:50.136
At our father's company.

17:55.830 --> 17:59.624
Which he founded using money
from my mother's trust.

18:00.168 --> 18:02.034
This has nothing to do with you.

18:03.296 --> 18:06.696
And if I find out you had
something to do with my wife...

18:16.909 --> 18:18.776
- You called the police?
- No.

18:18.786 --> 18:20.400
But I wish I had.

18:22.782 --> 18:25.450
Robert Brian Warner,
you're under arrest for extortion.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.419
You have the right to remain silent.

18:27.421 --> 18:29.359
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.589
- Dad?
- It'll gonna be okay.

18:30.591 --> 18:32.174
- Don't talk without a lawyer.
- You have the right to an attorney.

18:32.184 --> 18:33.421
- Dad!
- Excuse me, sir.

18:33.431 --> 18:34.358
You have the right to an attorney.

18:34.368 --> 18:35.683
If you cannot afford an attorney...

18:35.693 --> 18:37.162
John Warner, we have a
warrant for your arrest

18:37.164 --> 18:38.997
for bigamy and perjury.

18:39.007 --> 18:39.765
Read him his rights.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.299
You have the right to remain silent.

18:41.301 --> 18:43.666
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

18:43.676 --> 18:44.603
This way, Mr. Warner.

18:44.605 --> 18:46.499
What's happening?
Where are you taking them?

18:46.509 --> 18:48.774
Mrs. Warner, your husband
and son have been arrested

18:48.776 --> 18:51.245
on charges out of north Carolina.

18:51.527 --> 18:55.027
We're transferring them to
custody of the Charlotte police.

18:58.451 --> 19:00.852
Come on. Watch your head.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.931
Who are you?

19:14.861 --> 19:16.168
I'm his son.

19:26.493 --> 19:29.014
Sir, watch your head.

19:51.070 --> 19:53.095
You lied to me.

20:09.098 --> 20:10.333
All right, good work.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.502
You just, check in with me later

20:12.504 --> 20:14.571
and fill me in later.

20:18.987 --> 20:22.468
Mrs. Warner, I'm Detective Andrea
Cornell, Charlotte police.

20:22.478 --> 20:26.981
Can you tell me why my husband
and son have been arrested?

20:28.012 --> 20:31.618
Your son is being charged for extortion,

20:32.319 --> 20:33.988
and your husband is

20:34.298 --> 20:37.658
a person of interest in a
homicide investigation.

20:41.811 --> 20:44.498
Is there someone you can
call to be with you?

20:44.922 --> 20:47.568
Do you have to take them to Charlotte?

20:47.570 --> 20:50.371
Yes, ma'am, I do.

20:50.373 --> 20:52.773
Take my number.

20:59.854 --> 21:02.649
Despite not cooperating,
I found out about the blackmail.

21:02.651 --> 21:03.837
Good for you.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.475
Would've gone a lot faster
had you been forthcoming.

21:06.485 --> 21:07.684
Did R.B. kill my wife?

21:07.694 --> 21:09.193
I need you to follow
me down to the station

21:09.203 --> 21:12.037
- to give your statement.
- I'll make sure he gets there.

21:12.039 --> 21:14.940
There's still a bench warrant
out for your arrest, Detective.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.475
But since you're not Georgia police,

21:16.477 --> 21:18.477
you can't arrest me here, Detective.

21:18.479 --> 21:19.978
That's right.

21:19.980 --> 21:23.115
You're not my problem till
you're back in my jurisdiction.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.511
Drive carefully.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.565
Mandy, it's me.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.467
I need you to meet me at C.M.C.P.D.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.336
I'll be there in a few hours.

21:44.338 --> 21:46.672
Is everything okay? Should I call Dad?

21:47.370 --> 21:50.042
No. He's... he's already on his way.

21:50.044 --> 21:52.115
Eric, what is going on?

21:52.583 --> 21:54.210
I'll explain when I get there.

21:54.528 --> 21:55.763
Bye.

21:58.686 --> 22:00.552
Sorry, man.

22:00.554 --> 22:01.687
Your family's...

22:01.689 --> 22:04.122
Something.

22:04.124 --> 22:06.925
See, this... This just can't be real.

22:06.927 --> 22:10.118
I'm pretty sure if it was
a dream, I wouldn't be in it.

22:11.532 --> 22:13.098
22 days ago,

22:13.100 --> 22:15.867
my wife was pushed off
the roof of our building,

22:15.869 --> 22:18.070
and all I want to know is who did it.

22:18.072 --> 22:21.034
Everywhere I look...
Someone else is lying.

22:21.044 --> 22:24.476
Look, people can only hide
who they are for so long.

22:24.478 --> 22:28.113
The truth always comes out.

22:28.115 --> 22:29.748
But it's not all bad.

22:34.088 --> 22:38.490
Danny, my brother is a thief who
almost destroyed our company,

22:38.492 --> 22:41.626
my half-brother extorted me,
my sister-in-law is a pimp,

22:41.628 --> 22:45.330
and my father... My father's a bigamist.

22:45.332 --> 22:46.331
Yeah.

22:46.333 --> 22:49.339
But your wife was the real deal.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.875
Yeah.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.122
Yeah, she was.

23:05.686 --> 23:07.686
And I still don't know who killed her.

23:10.757 --> 23:13.024
Look, Cornell is a pain in the ass,

23:13.026 --> 23:14.726
but she's also a pit bull.

23:14.728 --> 23:18.764
She won't stop until she
locks the bastard up.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.932
Trust me.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.797
It's your murder. Which one you want?

23:40.807 --> 23:42.988
I'll take John, but you go first.

23:42.990 --> 23:44.972
R.B.'s the weaker link.

23:52.272 --> 23:55.300
Been a while since I seen one of these.

23:55.704 --> 23:58.603
You know, people think these things
are just slapped together...

23:58.605 --> 24:01.406
Grab some magazines, cut out whatever.

24:01.408 --> 24:03.575
But I appreciate the craftsmanship,

24:03.577 --> 24:05.032
the artistry.

24:06.113 --> 24:09.188
'Course, there was that
one little slip-up.

24:10.416 --> 24:13.518
Never lick the envelope, R.B.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.621
That's how you ended up in here with me.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.623
I wouldn't be too hard
on yourself, though.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.547
That's not how Kate found you.

24:20.557 --> 24:23.094
She was a smart cookie.

24:23.096 --> 24:24.362
The money Kate delivered,

24:24.364 --> 24:28.400
she slipped a GPS
transponder into the bag.

24:28.402 --> 24:30.437
That's how she got to you.

24:30.675 --> 24:33.038
She had the game rigged
from the beginning.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.372
What?

24:34.374 --> 24:38.143
You made it so simple for her,
and she had to complicate it.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.512
She found you, discovered who you are,

24:40.514 --> 24:42.147
and was going to expose you.

24:42.149 --> 24:44.149
I don't blame you for stopping her.

24:44.151 --> 24:46.518
- That's not what happened.
- Sure seems that way to me.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.552
No.

24:53.260 --> 24:57.262
About six months ago,
my company started to fail.

24:57.264 --> 25:01.457
I just wanted a loan to save it,
but my father shut me down.

25:01.713 --> 25:03.702
So you decided to get even with him.

25:03.704 --> 25:07.865
I didn't decide anything.
I wasn't planning this.

25:11.578 --> 25:12.777
It never would've happened

25:12.779 --> 25:15.380
if my father knew how
to change a flat tire.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.517
That's when I found out I had a brother

25:52.519 --> 25:55.754
and that he'd killed some kid.

25:55.756 --> 25:57.756
I had to go see who he was.

26:04.630 --> 26:08.300
My half-brother drives a $100,000 car,

26:08.302 --> 26:10.701
and I live hand-to-mouth.

26:30.985 --> 26:32.824
I just needed a loan.

26:32.826 --> 26:34.693
I could live with him
always saying no to me

26:34.695 --> 26:38.096
until I realized that he says
yes to them for everything.

26:38.098 --> 26:39.497
Must have made you angry.

26:39.499 --> 26:41.099
Hell, yeah, it did.

26:41.827 --> 26:44.336
I didn't know Eric,
but I knew I hated him.

26:44.338 --> 26:46.004
I knew he had to pay.

26:46.006 --> 26:47.605
Well, you got the money.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.174
It's all there.

26:49.176 --> 26:52.478
I didn't even go to pick it
up at the drop for weeks.

26:52.813 --> 26:54.245
Why not?

26:54.563 --> 26:58.216
I thought it was because I was scared.

26:58.218 --> 27:00.478
But then I realized...

27:01.488 --> 27:03.855
It wasn't about the money.

27:03.857 --> 27:06.831
It was about hurting what
my dad loved the most.

27:06.841 --> 27:08.326
Blackmail?

27:08.328 --> 27:10.462
- How dare you?
- They owe me.

27:10.464 --> 27:12.831
They have nothing to do with you.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.699
You... you have no right!

27:14.701 --> 27:15.767
How much is enough?

27:15.769 --> 27:18.470
Says the piece of crap
with two families.

27:20.140 --> 27:23.141
Why weren't we good enough?
Why... why did you need them?

27:23.143 --> 27:24.628
It wasn't...

27:26.757 --> 27:28.580
I love our life.

27:28.582 --> 27:30.482
And I love my life with them.

27:30.484 --> 27:32.417
But you had enough from
your other life with them

27:32.419 --> 27:33.585
to make ours better!

27:33.587 --> 27:36.408
What didn't you have?!
What was so hard?!

27:36.589 --> 27:40.239
You're 43 years old! You still
expect Daddy to wipe your ass?!

27:44.172 --> 27:47.534
I had two lives...
neither of them was better.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.135
Money doesn't make everything better.

27:50.137 --> 27:52.404
Sometimes it makes it worse.

27:52.406 --> 27:55.507
Only people with money say that.

27:56.083 --> 27:58.176
Well, that's a great story, R.B.

27:58.792 --> 28:00.578
However, it doesn't prove

28:00.580 --> 28:02.913
that you didn't murder Kate Warner.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.851
When Kate was killed,

28:06.853 --> 28:09.487
I was at the hospital with my mother.

28:09.811 --> 28:12.357
She was getting chemo.

28:12.359 --> 28:14.859
Dad couldn't be there, of course.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.203
Eric, what is going on?

28:25.205 --> 28:26.371
The cops won't tell me what's up.

28:26.373 --> 28:29.340
Why are you doing this to my family?

28:29.342 --> 28:30.909
I'm not doing anything to you.

28:30.911 --> 28:32.243
Well, you show up out of the blue,

28:32.245 --> 28:34.129
pretending to be someone else,

28:34.139 --> 28:36.748
and... and suddenly my husband
and son are under arrest.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.529
What am I supposed to think?

28:38.539 --> 28:41.586
Eric, who is under arrest,
and who is this woman?

28:42.334 --> 28:45.623
I'm Corinne Warner. Who are you?

28:46.020 --> 28:47.158
Warner?

28:49.615 --> 28:51.629
There's no real easy way to say this.

28:51.631 --> 28:55.166
Corinne, this is my sister, Amanda.

28:56.787 --> 28:58.931
Amanda, this is, um...

28:59.406 --> 29:01.106
This is Dad's other wife.

29:01.942 --> 29:03.391
Whoa.

29:03.965 --> 29:05.897
Our father's a bigamist.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.585
Whoa.

29:25.823 --> 29:27.686
R.B.'S got a solid alibi.

29:27.696 --> 29:29.530
Nurse and two patients confirm

29:29.532 --> 29:31.476
he was with his mother
during her chemo treatments

29:31.486 --> 29:32.833
when Kate was killed.

29:32.835 --> 29:34.541
You got to hand it to this guy...

29:34.551 --> 29:36.818
Living a double life for 40 years?

29:36.820 --> 29:39.120
Undercovers can't pull
it off for that long.

29:39.122 --> 29:41.222
Cops are doing a job.

29:41.224 --> 29:43.691
John Warner lied every
time he opened his mouth

29:43.693 --> 29:45.393
because he wanted everything.

29:45.395 --> 29:47.311
Self-preservation's certainly a motive

29:47.321 --> 29:49.671
if Kate found out what he was up to.

30:07.883 --> 30:09.615
Is my son all right?

30:11.512 --> 30:13.222
Which one?

30:13.232 --> 30:16.424
R.B. is in custody, and Eric...
I'd imagine... is in shock.

30:16.426 --> 30:18.660
Decades of deceit by their father

30:18.662 --> 30:20.461
builds up a lot of anger.

30:23.133 --> 30:25.066
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

30:25.068 --> 30:26.922
Yet you hurt everyone.

30:30.673 --> 30:32.907
You... you may not understand,

30:32.909 --> 30:36.077
and you may not believe me, detective,

30:36.079 --> 30:40.248
but I love both my families very much.

30:40.984 --> 30:44.118
Must have been difficult
living two lives.

30:44.608 --> 30:46.754
The fact that you got
away with it for so long

30:46.756 --> 30:49.090
makes me wonder what you would have done

30:49.092 --> 30:50.925
if Kate found out.

30:53.529 --> 30:56.297
- But she didn't.
- You had a lot to lose.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.200
I didn't kill Kate.

31:02.204 --> 31:06.254
When did you first discover that your
other son was blackmailing Eric?

31:06.510 --> 31:07.809
We have the cash.

31:07.811 --> 31:11.679
We have the GPS tracker
that Kate put within it.

31:11.681 --> 31:15.250
And we have R.B.'s DNA on the
envelope of the extortion letter.

31:15.260 --> 31:16.651
He's going away.

31:23.093 --> 31:27.794
It was yesterday that I learned
about... the extortion.

31:27.804 --> 31:31.167
When Eric showed me the letter,
I realized what had happened.

31:31.177 --> 31:32.266
It was months ago.

31:32.268 --> 31:34.068
I put Eric's juvenile
file in my briefcase.

31:34.070 --> 31:35.770
I was gonna take it home,
and then I got a call

31:35.772 --> 31:37.305
that said that Corinne had relapsed.

31:37.307 --> 31:42.342
And then I forgot about the file
until you requested a copy.

31:43.295 --> 31:46.681
You put it all together
and went to talk to R.B.?

31:46.683 --> 31:48.182
I went to his office.

31:48.184 --> 31:50.910
He wasn't there, so I went
back in the morning and...

31:53.254 --> 31:55.156
I thought if I could get
the money back and...

31:55.158 --> 31:58.092
Sweep it all under the rug. Is that it?

32:04.199 --> 32:07.268
Kate didn't know about my
two families, Detective,

32:07.270 --> 32:09.771
or she would've confronted me,
and she didn't.

32:11.707 --> 32:14.950
I had no reason to kill her.
You have to believe that.

32:19.215 --> 32:20.915
Hey, Major.

32:20.917 --> 32:22.650
What did Cornell get on John Warner?

32:22.652 --> 32:24.919
We can put him away for
bigamy and perjury.

32:25.207 --> 32:26.468
Not murder?

32:26.478 --> 32:28.404
Can't rule him out in Kate's death.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.958
Well, aside from two employees,
seems like you can't eliminate anyone.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.434
It was a party. Time of
death can only be narrowed

32:33.444 --> 32:35.363
to a 15-minute window.

32:35.365 --> 32:37.231
Two felonies mean we
can hold John Warner

32:37.233 --> 32:38.841
until we figure this out.

32:38.851 --> 32:40.201
I put the wrong guy away once before.

32:40.203 --> 32:41.702
I'm not doing it again.

32:41.704 --> 32:43.438
John Warner is more valuable to me

32:43.440 --> 32:45.506
as a cooperating witness against R.B.

32:45.822 --> 32:47.742
You got to cut him loose.

32:50.279 --> 32:53.448
Kate wanted me to pay
after that first letter.

32:53.450 --> 32:54.949
Maybe if I had...

32:54.951 --> 32:56.184
You can torture yourself,

32:56.186 --> 32:58.319
or you can help us put
the culprit in prison.

33:01.557 --> 33:03.825
I want the person who
killed my wife in prison.

33:03.827 --> 33:05.226
Who is it?

33:05.228 --> 33:06.394
Who?

33:06.396 --> 33:08.329
I don't know what happened
or what to think.

33:08.331 --> 33:09.897
Is it... is it R.B.? Is it Melanie?

33:09.899 --> 33:11.065
Is it my brother? Is it my father?

33:11.067 --> 33:13.816
- Who killed my wife?
- I can't tell you that yet.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.304
Is it because you still think it's me,

33:16.306 --> 33:18.239
or is it because you just don't know?

33:18.241 --> 33:20.408
Take your pick.

33:22.945 --> 33:24.412
Kate's iPad... We need that

33:24.414 --> 33:27.064
to make the case against
your halfbrother.

33:43.065 --> 33:44.599
No, thank you.

33:44.601 --> 33:46.493
Is there anything I can get you?

33:46.952 --> 33:49.202
Your mother... Did you call her?

33:49.938 --> 33:52.139
She's been in a coma for a long time.

33:55.477 --> 33:58.246
So, when John was with us, you...

33:58.248 --> 33:59.680
We were alone.

34:00.857 --> 34:04.385
What kind of person looks his
family in the eye and lies?

34:07.055 --> 34:09.090
How do you live with yourself?

34:09.817 --> 34:12.190
Hey. What happened, Mandy? Is Dad okay?

34:12.199 --> 34:14.228
- Yeah.
- He bailed you out?

34:14.230 --> 34:16.496
- What's going on? Where is he?
- Dad's with Cornell.

34:18.364 --> 34:20.501
Damn it, Eric! What did you do?!

34:20.503 --> 34:22.003
Dad did this to himself.

34:22.005 --> 34:24.038
How many more people's lives
are you gonna destroy?

34:24.040 --> 34:26.841
That depends on how many
more secrets you all have.

34:26.842 --> 34:28.409
Stop it. Not here.

34:28.411 --> 34:30.077
First I killed Kate, and then Melanie,

34:30.079 --> 34:31.482
and now... now Dad did?

34:33.815 --> 34:35.283
I don't care what Eric's told you,

34:35.284 --> 34:37.184
my father did not kill Kate.

34:37.186 --> 34:40.121
The only person that you
should be looking at is Eric.

34:41.790 --> 34:44.547
He pushed our mom down
the stairs 20 years ago.

34:51.199 --> 34:54.502
And what do I get? Nothing!

34:54.504 --> 34:56.804
You lazy little...

34:56.806 --> 34:58.039
Mom, stop!

35:13.254 --> 35:16.157
Eric told us to lie.

35:16.159 --> 35:17.525
He did it once.

35:18.727 --> 35:20.061
He probably did it again.

35:30.648 --> 35:32.725
Is that true, Mr. Warner?

35:36.897 --> 35:39.165
Did you push your
mother down the stairs?

35:43.036 --> 35:46.038
- Yes.
- No, he didn't. Um...

35:49.343 --> 35:52.278
You do realize you're
confessing to attempted murder?

35:52.280 --> 35:55.481
Self-defense... not that
there's a way to prove that.

35:55.483 --> 35:57.650
Of course... When it comes to you,

35:57.652 --> 35:59.452
it's always someone else's fault?

35:59.454 --> 36:01.020
Eric, what did you do?

36:01.022 --> 36:02.989
He didn't do anything wrong.

36:02.991 --> 36:05.658
Mandy, stop protecting him.
I saw him push her.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.760
How could you see anything
at the bottom of the stairs?

36:07.762 --> 36:09.762
You don't know what you are
talking about, so shut up.

36:09.764 --> 36:11.898
I know that Eric took away
the only mother I had.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.833
You should be glad.

36:13.835 --> 36:15.201
I know I am.

36:15.203 --> 36:17.336
Eric, stop talking.

36:17.338 --> 36:20.106
Eric, this is not you. Wh-what happened?

36:20.108 --> 36:22.758
Someone had to protect
us from that woman.

36:24.786 --> 36:28.614
While you were off playing
house with wife number one,

36:28.616 --> 36:31.717
we were dealing with the drunk
and abusive wife number two.

36:32.170 --> 36:33.452
"Wife number one"?

36:33.454 --> 36:35.521
Dad, you were married before Mom?

36:35.523 --> 36:36.956
He still is.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.816
Her name's Corinne.

36:42.496 --> 36:44.764
This this is a mistake.

36:44.766 --> 36:45.932
- Dad!
- Not now.

36:45.934 --> 36:49.202
- Wha... Dad?
- We'll talk later.

36:51.605 --> 36:54.073
There was no abuse, all right?

36:54.075 --> 36:56.209
Well, since none of
your stories match up,

36:56.211 --> 36:59.278
you leave me no choice, then,
to open another investigation.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.848
Detective, can I have a minute, please?

37:13.488 --> 37:16.128
You... you can't listen to anything
Patrick has to say right now.

37:16.130 --> 37:19.365
He is angry and has an agenda.

37:19.367 --> 37:21.354
So do you, counselor.

37:22.402 --> 37:25.504
Eric was protecting me.

37:25.506 --> 37:26.973
It was self-defense.

37:26.975 --> 37:28.107
Then you lied.

37:28.109 --> 37:29.642
He did push your mother down the stairs.

37:29.644 --> 37:32.078
I'm telling you, it wasn't his fault.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.781
Your entire family has
lied at every turn.

37:35.783 --> 37:39.452
I can't trust anything
any one of you say

37:39.454 --> 37:41.621
without the corroboration
of someone else.

37:41.623 --> 37:43.756
Is that all?

37:48.869 --> 37:50.496
What's happening with my son?

37:50.498 --> 37:53.599
He is being charged and
booked on extortion.

37:53.601 --> 37:55.301
He blackmailed Eric Warner.

37:55.303 --> 37:57.336
R.B. did what?

37:57.998 --> 38:01.607
I'm sorry, Mrs. Warner,
but we have solid evidence.

38:01.609 --> 38:03.309
The only thing you can
do for your son now

38:03.311 --> 38:06.212
is post bail and hire a good attorney.

38:08.282 --> 38:10.583
You're free to go for now.

38:12.779 --> 38:14.368
You disappointed?

38:15.757 --> 38:19.258
I didn't tell that cop
about Mom for revenge.

38:19.260 --> 38:23.010
No one lies to themselves
quite like you do, Patrick.

38:23.020 --> 38:25.932
If you two are gonna fight,
take it outside.

38:28.423 --> 38:30.303
I'm so sorry, honey.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.726
I forgive you.

38:48.790 --> 38:51.123
I am done with this family.

38:51.125 --> 38:52.458
Doubtful.

38:53.753 --> 38:55.624
You always need something.

39:07.407 --> 39:08.908
You feel better?

39:08.910 --> 39:10.943
Just capital.

39:10.945 --> 39:12.044
You?

39:22.923 --> 39:24.724
Eric.

39:25.736 --> 39:29.095
Eric, I'm sorry for all of this.

39:29.097 --> 39:32.231
I'm sorry for what R.B. did, for John,

39:32.233 --> 39:34.033
for all the lies.

39:34.035 --> 39:35.601
You didn't know, did you?

39:35.603 --> 39:39.238
Um, I'm still trying to process

39:39.240 --> 39:41.173
the enormity of what he did.

39:41.175 --> 39:44.043
I feel so stupid...
44 years of marriage,

39:44.045 --> 39:47.380
another wife, three children...

39:47.382 --> 39:49.715
I'm the dumbest woman on the planet.

39:49.717 --> 39:52.451
If you didn't know...

39:52.453 --> 39:54.820
How can you forgive him so easily?

39:54.985 --> 39:58.591
You... you think that was easy?

39:58.593 --> 40:01.494
Forgiveness is hard.

40:01.496 --> 40:03.996
But if I couldn't find the
strength to do it myself,

40:03.998 --> 40:06.265
I couldn't ask you to.

40:08.904 --> 40:11.037
Corinne,
my father doesn't deserve...

40:11.039 --> 40:13.639
I'm asking you to forgive my son.

40:13.641 --> 40:15.641
I know I have no right,

40:15.643 --> 40:21.414
but I am begging you to say
you gave R.B. the money.

40:26.486 --> 40:29.622
Look, the cops already know that
Kate paid the blackmail. I...

40:29.624 --> 40:33.626
You're the victim here. Lie.

40:33.628 --> 40:38.130
Please forgive R.B. Let my son go.

40:38.132 --> 40:41.133
If you have any compassion,
don't let them send him away.

40:41.135 --> 40:44.138
Your son put me...

40:45.873 --> 40:48.832
- Put Kate through hell.
- I know.

40:51.285 --> 40:52.945
I-I'm dying, Eric.

40:52.947 --> 40:54.246
I don't have long.

40:56.616 --> 40:59.852
I can't afford to hold a grudge.

40:59.854 --> 41:01.754
But neither can you.

41:03.069 --> 41:06.058
Hate and anger will eat you alive.

41:16.304 --> 41:17.736
Hi.

41:17.738 --> 41:20.339
You were right. It was the wrong jacket.

41:20.341 --> 41:22.541
But that's not even the best part.

41:22.543 --> 41:25.411
The only epithelials that
I found on the clothes

41:25.413 --> 41:29.115
were from southeast China,
specifically Dongguan.

41:29.117 --> 41:30.783
Which means?

41:31.292 --> 41:32.418
Here.

41:32.420 --> 41:35.821
I just put my epithelials on
the sleeve of my lab coat.

41:35.823 --> 41:38.357
We all do that any time
we put something on

41:38.359 --> 41:39.825
or take it off.

41:39.827 --> 41:41.360
What's that have to do with China?

41:41.362 --> 41:43.195
That's where the clothes were made.

41:43.197 --> 41:47.032
The only skin cells that I found
on the inside of the garments

41:47.034 --> 41:49.702
were from the Chinese
worker who made them.

41:49.704 --> 41:51.904
You're saying the clothes were brandnew.

41:52.283 --> 41:55.908
Never worn, never even tried on.

41:55.910 --> 41:59.478
So the killer dumped their clothes
from the night of the party

41:59.480 --> 42:01.847
and then turned in
brandnew ones to police.

42:01.849 --> 42:03.082
Yeah.

42:03.703 --> 42:05.417
It's a bait-and-switch.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.653
I know who.

42:07.655 --> 42:10.656
Now I just need to know why.

42:15.344 --> 42:17.780
Previously on "Secrets and Lies"...

42:18.051 --> 42:20.842
- Who killed my wife?
- I can't tell you that yet.

42:20.852 --> 42:22.819
You have two wives... Two families.

42:22.821 --> 42:25.341
We have a warrant for
your arrest for bigamy.

42:25.351 --> 42:27.490
Amanda, this is Dad's other wife.

42:27.492 --> 42:29.866
Kate had a baby boy she
gave up for adoption.

42:29.876 --> 42:31.529
- Meet Charlie.
- Go home.

42:31.539 --> 42:33.262
I'm not going anywhere without my kid.

42:33.264 --> 42:35.097
If I see you again, I put you in cuffs.

42:35.099 --> 42:37.386
- How the hell did you find me?
- It'll come to you.

42:37.396 --> 42:39.802
It's everything your key witness
has provided for testing.

42:39.804 --> 42:42.308
That's not the right jacket.
The killer dumped their clothes

42:42.318 --> 42:43.939
and then turned in brand-new ones.

42:43.941 --> 42:46.676
I know who. Now I just need to know why.

42:46.678 --> 42:48.477
My father did not kill Kate.

42:48.479 --> 42:51.189
The only person that you
should be looking at is Eric.

42:51.199 --> 42:53.915
He pushed our mom down
the stairs 20 years ago.

43:02.993 --> 43:05.528
I'm exhausted, Mandy. What is it?

43:12.269 --> 43:14.470
I'll be right there.

43:14.472 --> 43:16.038
Patrick, please.

43:16.040 --> 43:17.907
Let's... Let's just go inside.

43:17.909 --> 43:19.775
Patrick.

43:19.777 --> 43:21.110
You called him?

43:21.112 --> 43:22.478
Of course I did.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.679
You're drunk and you're not thinking.

43:23.681 --> 43:25.181
No, I am thinking!

43:25.183 --> 43:27.783
It's all very,
very clear to me right now.

43:28.791 --> 43:30.152
I have nothing.

43:30.154 --> 43:32.455
- No... Patrick, you have us...
- Just stop!

43:34.292 --> 43:35.524
You have us.

43:35.526 --> 43:36.802
I want Dad.

43:36.812 --> 43:38.928
I-I can't reach him right now.

43:39.582 --> 43:41.717
- He doesn't care.
- Patrick.

43:42.061 --> 43:43.466
You did this.

43:43.468 --> 43:45.534
Y-y-you took Mom.

43:45.536 --> 43:47.370
You took Melanie. You took Dad.

43:47.372 --> 43:48.571
- Y-y...
- Their actions did that!

43:48.573 --> 43:50.821
- Just walk away from the ledge.
- Screw you, Eric!

43:50.831 --> 43:52.198
- No!
- Patrick!

43:57.204 --> 43:59.305
- Get back!
- Patrick, come down. Please.

43:59.307 --> 44:00.870
Please, Patrick.

44:02.409 --> 44:04.643
All right, just... please.

44:04.645 --> 44:06.645
Patrick, please.

44:09.482 --> 44:11.317
Please.

44:11.727 --> 44:13.447
Is this where it happened?

44:14.454 --> 44:16.121
Is this where Kate went over...

44:16.123 --> 44:17.690
Or somewhere else?

44:18.413 --> 44:21.227
- Kate didn't just go over.
- She was pushed.

44:25.225 --> 44:26.848
Yeah, you're right.

44:26.858 --> 44:29.702
It wasn't me, but somebody killed Kate.

44:31.327 --> 44:33.839
Patrick.

44:33.841 --> 44:37.241
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Patrick.
Patrick, no, no, no, no, no.

44:41.264 --> 44:42.848
You think it hurt?

44:42.850 --> 44:45.094
- Patrick. Patrick.
- Patrick.

44:45.104 --> 44:48.120
Please, I cannot lose
another person that I love.

44:48.122 --> 44:49.255
- Hey!
- Hey!

44:49.257 --> 44:51.457
Whoa! What are you doing?

44:51.459 --> 44:52.925
- Get off me!
- You're an idiot...

44:52.927 --> 44:55.211
- Eric!
- But you're my brother.

44:55.762 --> 44:58.197
Mandy, help me get him to the car.

44:58.199 --> 45:01.267
- I don't like you anymore, Eric.
- Okay, okay.

45:04.329 --> 45:05.856
You're still here.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.508
The only woman who scares me
more than my wife is you.

45:09.510 --> 45:11.510
I'll take that as a
compliment. Where are my...

45:11.512 --> 45:13.078
DNA results you requested

45:13.080 --> 45:16.915
from the blood on the planter at SEG.

45:16.917 --> 45:18.584
Who's better than me?

45:19.426 --> 45:20.626
Just me.

45:22.656 --> 45:23.922
What's this?

45:24.424 --> 45:26.725
Some additional tests I want
performed on the sample.

45:26.727 --> 45:27.760
These aren't standard.

45:27.762 --> 45:29.928
Which is exactly why I want them run.

45:29.930 --> 45:31.897
You already know who killed Kate Warner.

45:31.899 --> 45:35.267
I do, but everyone at the party
had means and opportunity.

45:35.269 --> 45:37.704
These results will give me motive.

45:38.719 --> 45:41.516
You want me to run these
tonight, don't you?

45:43.693 --> 45:46.078
Don't bat your eyes at me.

45:50.950 --> 45:53.886
Me eating your pancakes
doesn't mean that we're okay.

45:53.888 --> 45:55.954
I'm still mad at you.

45:55.956 --> 45:57.389
Of course.

45:57.999 --> 46:00.159
You always blame the wrong person.

46:00.161 --> 46:01.460
You committed fraud.

46:01.462 --> 46:03.162
Thanks to you,
I'm going to the big house

46:03.164 --> 46:05.197
where big bubba's waiting
to make me his bitch.

46:05.199 --> 46:07.266
Our father was married to someone else

46:07.268 --> 46:09.098
before he met our mother.

46:09.108 --> 46:10.269
And he had a kid!

46:10.271 --> 46:12.071
He lived with both
women all these years.

46:12.073 --> 46:13.740
That is his fault.

46:14.411 --> 46:16.528
And you pushed Mom.

46:16.961 --> 46:18.844
She drank her feelings...

46:19.488 --> 46:20.779
Just like you.

46:20.781 --> 46:25.851
The only difference is you
hurt yourself and she hurt us.

46:27.363 --> 46:30.744
You pushed Mom down the
stairs because you snapped,

46:31.167 --> 46:33.065
just like you always do.

46:34.590 --> 46:36.762
No, that's not how it happened.

46:37.535 --> 46:39.331
You!

46:39.664 --> 46:44.249
Everything I do is for you,
you lazy little brat.

46:44.513 --> 46:45.871
What do I get?

46:46.352 --> 46:47.573
Nothing!

46:47.575 --> 46:50.175
- What is wrong with you?
- Mom, please, stop it!

46:50.177 --> 46:52.544
- You're hurting me.
- Leave her alone!

47:11.231 --> 47:14.767
I'd never seen her so still.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.171
None of us had.

47:17.181 --> 47:18.495
She wasn't yelling.

47:21.265 --> 47:23.575
I only remember her falling.

47:23.979 --> 47:26.864
What about Halloween when
your arm was broken?

47:27.429 --> 47:29.415
You remember how it happened?

47:31.218 --> 47:35.060
Yeah, I was a magician. I tripped
on my cape and broke my arm.

47:35.148 --> 47:36.488
No.

47:36.490 --> 47:38.757
No, that's the story she told Dad.

47:38.759 --> 47:41.860
You never had a cape, Patrick.
You had a wand.

47:43.435 --> 47:45.988
And you were waving it around

47:46.641 --> 47:49.146
and you knocked over her drink.

47:50.337 --> 47:54.140
She came at you and she yanked your arm.

47:54.150 --> 47:57.585
"You see what you made me do?"

47:57.587 --> 48:00.099
That's... that's what she said, right?

48:05.124 --> 48:07.491
Why did she hate us so much?

48:07.501 --> 48:10.564
She was unhappy and she blamed us.

48:10.566 --> 48:13.000
I really didn't remember.

48:14.604 --> 48:16.103
Maybe I didn't want to.

48:16.105 --> 48:18.272
Listen, we all cope differently.

48:18.274 --> 48:22.017
You were just a little kid,
and I can't blame you for that.

48:23.779 --> 48:25.613
You can blame me for telling Cornell

48:25.615 --> 48:27.494
that you tried to kill Mom.

48:27.803 --> 48:31.185
No, I can't, because you told the truth.

48:32.129 --> 48:35.790
We kept that secret for
over 20 years, Patrick.

48:35.792 --> 48:39.126
I should've never put that
burden on you and Mandy.

48:42.431 --> 48:45.599
It's time that I own what I did.

49:04.581 --> 49:06.020
Sleep it off.

49:19.143 --> 49:21.110
Patrick.

49:35.786 --> 49:38.688
How's Patrick?

49:38.690 --> 49:40.106
Gone.

49:40.116 --> 49:41.694
Gone where?

49:41.704 --> 49:43.259
I don't know.

49:43.261 --> 49:46.261
I'm tired of picking up after him.

49:46.271 --> 49:48.198
I know.

49:52.891 --> 49:54.933
You know, I think he...

49:54.943 --> 49:56.710
I think he finally remembers
about Mom, though.

49:56.712 --> 49:59.846
I wish he'd done that before telling
Cornell you tried to kill her.

49:59.848 --> 50:01.581
That's not gonna go away.

50:01.583 --> 50:02.949
It was self defense.

50:02.951 --> 50:04.121
You're my witness, Mandy.

50:04.131 --> 50:06.671
- Just tell them what happened.
- I'm your sister.

50:06.681 --> 50:08.581
Anything I say is biased.

50:08.583 --> 50:11.437
Do you really think a
jury is gonna believe me?

50:11.799 --> 50:15.470
Stratman says Vice isn't
gonna charge me or the firm.

50:16.256 --> 50:19.458
One thing goes away, something
new smacks me in the face.

50:19.460 --> 50:22.428
Just lay low and stay
out of Cornell's way.

50:22.430 --> 50:24.430
Every time!

50:24.432 --> 50:27.781
Every time I try,
she just keeps popping back up.

50:27.887 --> 50:31.370
What the hell do you expect me to do?

50:32.252 --> 50:35.975
I don't know how you have
kept it together this long.

50:38.445 --> 50:41.714
Our father had another family...

50:41.716 --> 50:44.950
A whole other family.

50:44.952 --> 50:46.385
Yeah.

50:47.713 --> 50:49.236
If he had been home,

50:49.246 --> 50:52.658
Mom, Stephen, Porter...

50:52.660 --> 50:54.827
You think the past would've
been any different?

50:55.222 --> 50:58.320
I was only 16, Mandy.

50:59.410 --> 51:02.735
Mom was gonna hurt you.
She was going after you.

51:02.737 --> 51:06.005
At the time, I was sure
I did the right thing.

51:06.007 --> 51:09.074
But looking back, I wonder,
was it... was it that bad?

51:09.076 --> 51:10.643
Yes.

51:10.645 --> 51:13.078
It was probably worse than we remember.

51:13.080 --> 51:14.580
I hated her.

51:14.582 --> 51:16.682
I hated what she did to us.
I wanted to know.

51:16.684 --> 51:18.717
I want to know...
Did I do it on purpose?

51:18.719 --> 51:20.786
Did I want her dead?!

51:23.890 --> 51:27.660
After it all happened,
we were keeping this big secret

51:27.662 --> 51:29.895
and all the pain and all the rage,

51:29.897 --> 51:32.231
it just built up.

51:34.935 --> 51:38.604
And then Stephen came after me,

51:38.606 --> 51:41.073
and he was a bully just like her,

51:41.075 --> 51:43.452
but then he said those things about her,

51:43.462 --> 51:45.544
and still...

51:45.546 --> 51:47.179
I lost it.

51:47.181 --> 51:50.215
You protected everyone.

51:50.217 --> 51:52.918
You put everyone else first.

51:52.920 --> 51:56.789
And it is time that we stopped
taking advantage of you.

52:06.266 --> 52:08.597
The additional tests came back?

52:09.020 --> 52:10.336
Yep.

52:20.759 --> 52:23.175
You're positive this
wasn't the victim's blood?

52:23.185 --> 52:24.668
Of course I am.

52:29.522 --> 52:31.490
I don't know how you take it like that.

52:31.492 --> 52:33.145
It's amazing you have any teeth left.

52:33.155 --> 52:35.266
Shut up.

52:36.572 --> 52:38.610
You expecting someone?

52:38.883 --> 52:40.286
No.

52:44.147 --> 52:45.170
Hey.

52:45.172 --> 52:47.006
What are you doing here?

52:47.008 --> 52:48.641
My breathing frustrate you?

52:48.643 --> 52:51.843
Oh, my god, if this is foreplay,
please just stop it.

52:51.936 --> 52:53.345
Excuse me.

52:53.347 --> 52:54.947
Could we... talk alone?

52:54.949 --> 52:57.316
Whatever it is, just say it.

52:58.277 --> 52:59.785
Danny's still looking for his daughter?

52:59.787 --> 53:01.053
Yeah.

53:01.055 --> 53:02.821
Carly reached out to me.

53:02.823 --> 53:04.590
Reached out or reached around?

53:04.592 --> 53:06.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:06.127 --> 53:08.027
Hey. You know where she is?

53:08.600 --> 53:09.895
Yeah. Yeah, look.

53:09.897 --> 53:11.263
A few girls started over.

53:11.265 --> 53:14.166
They have a new, you know, setup.

53:15.608 --> 53:18.137
- You're not calling Danny.
- His daughter's missing.

53:18.139 --> 53:19.936
Carly's the only connection to her.

53:19.946 --> 53:22.293
- Text me the address.
- Yeah.

53:31.652 --> 53:33.719
Hello? Who are you here to see?

53:33.721 --> 53:35.521
Carly.

53:35.523 --> 53:38.190
Carly's still upstairs with a client.

53:38.192 --> 53:40.325
You can wait right here.

53:40.327 --> 53:42.428
Hey! You can't go up there!

53:43.413 --> 53:44.790
Wait!

53:51.071 --> 53:53.087
- Rachel.
- Dad?

53:55.539 --> 53:57.078
Get out!

53:57.711 --> 53:59.445
I said get out!

54:01.014 --> 54:02.748
Get out!!

54:14.319 --> 54:17.692
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

54:22.261 --> 54:23.850
Why are you here?

54:23.860 --> 54:25.537
You come to judge me or lecture me?

54:25.547 --> 54:26.913
I came to save you.

54:26.915 --> 54:30.383
- I don't need to be saved.
- Look, Rach.

54:30.385 --> 54:32.919
I know I wasn't there
when it counted, okay?

54:32.921 --> 54:35.055
I trusted Mitch. He was my partner.

54:35.057 --> 54:37.691
I didn't know what he was doing to you.

54:37.693 --> 54:40.827
Look, not until after you split.

54:40.829 --> 54:43.229
I should've protected you.

54:43.231 --> 54:45.099
Okay? You are my baby.

54:45.109 --> 54:47.685
I'm never gonna forgive myself.

54:47.695 --> 54:49.803
But I'm here now to make it right.

54:49.805 --> 54:51.671
I don't need you.

54:51.673 --> 54:54.377
I am making it right.
I took back my power.

54:54.387 --> 54:57.811
- No, sweetie, that's not t...
- I am in control of my body.

54:57.813 --> 55:00.977
I say who, what, and
how much. I am in charge.

55:00.987 --> 55:04.184
You're not taking back your power.

55:04.186 --> 55:06.210
You're just numbing the pain.

55:06.220 --> 55:08.654
- Come with me. Please, Rach.
- No.

55:09.733 --> 55:11.990
- Please.
- I am fine.

55:13.359 --> 55:15.604
You can go home now.

55:25.225 --> 55:26.751
What now?

55:27.713 --> 55:29.208
I can leave...

55:30.108 --> 55:32.436
Or do what's best for Rachel.

55:33.424 --> 55:34.791
Which is?

55:38.735 --> 55:41.215
Hey, Danny Voss found his daughter.

55:41.225 --> 55:42.458
It's not pretty.

55:42.460 --> 55:44.293
I knew it wouldn't be.

55:44.295 --> 55:46.528
You tried to help the guy.
Do you want to be there?

55:46.530 --> 55:48.797
I can't. I'm closing in on my killer.

55:48.799 --> 55:50.599
Who is it?

55:54.367 --> 55:56.873
Can't believe you called the cops.

56:02.817 --> 56:04.546
Take it easy!

56:04.548 --> 56:06.895
- Hands behind your back.
- All right.

56:07.372 --> 56:08.851
She's your child, man.

56:08.853 --> 56:11.153
Look, legally, Rachel is an adult.

56:11.155 --> 56:12.521
I can't make her come with me

56:12.523 --> 56:14.909
and she won't leave by choice, so...

56:14.919 --> 56:17.025
So after everything,
you're just gonna give up?

56:17.027 --> 56:19.528
What, does this look like I'm giving up?

56:39.826 --> 56:43.470
This is just not how you
reconcile with your daughter.

56:45.429 --> 56:47.422
If my kid's gonna hook,

56:47.424 --> 56:50.479
she can get used to going to jail.

56:56.045 --> 56:57.422
I tried to talk to Rachel.

56:57.432 --> 57:01.365
I gave her the option...
You or a mug shot.

57:01.375 --> 57:02.743
No joy.

57:04.181 --> 57:05.813
Can I talk to her?

57:10.079 --> 57:12.047
Um...

57:12.049 --> 57:14.783
- Y-you don't know me.
- You're a friend of my dad's.

57:14.785 --> 57:17.920
That all I need to know. Go away.

57:17.922 --> 57:20.489
I get it... you're reacting to trauma.

57:20.491 --> 57:22.524
You don't know anything about me.

57:24.294 --> 57:26.929
I know you wanted to
play for the Yankees.

57:28.965 --> 57:32.067
I know you used to wear a
little bullet around your neck,

57:33.048 --> 57:35.448
and I know that your father's partner

57:36.013 --> 57:38.413
betrayed your trust in the worst way.

57:42.753 --> 57:44.880
So he told you some stories.

57:44.882 --> 57:47.015
Guess what...
he doesn't know me, either.

57:47.452 --> 57:52.821
So you can quit wasting your
breath and tell him he's too late.

57:52.823 --> 57:54.423
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

57:54.425 --> 57:58.527
Too late is when you find
your wife in a pool of blood.

58:01.308 --> 58:05.434
Too late is when you
lose your unborn child.

58:05.436 --> 58:07.436
I'm not gonna play "who's
the bigger victim?"

58:07.438 --> 58:08.704
Good.

58:08.706 --> 58:11.573
Good, because you're
not a victim, Rachel.

58:12.259 --> 58:15.043
Mitch is dead, and you're not.

58:17.110 --> 58:19.974
- Did my dad...
- I'm sure he would have...

58:21.104 --> 58:24.419
If that guy didn't off himself first.

58:28.701 --> 58:31.119
It doesn't change anything.

58:38.674 --> 58:42.129
Your father followed
breadcrumbs to find you.

58:42.139 --> 58:43.905
He walked out on a trial.

58:43.907 --> 58:47.644
He tanked his career.
He... he risked his freedom.

58:48.879 --> 58:51.646
The only thing he cares about is you.

58:56.552 --> 59:00.655
How many women do you work
with can say the same?

59:20.502 --> 59:22.177
Dad.

59:24.195 --> 59:25.580
Yeah, Rach.

59:25.582 --> 59:27.749
Can I change my mind?

59:27.751 --> 59:29.384
Come here.

59:44.112 --> 59:45.767
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

59:45.769 --> 59:48.406
Listen, she's gonna arrest me now.

59:48.618 --> 59:50.505
Eric Warner, you're under arrest...

59:51.425 --> 59:53.074
He didn't kill Kate.

59:53.076 --> 59:56.478
For the attempted murder
of Yvonne Warner.

59:58.541 --> 01:00:01.383
Danny, take your daughter. Go home.

01:00:02.092 --> 01:00:04.519
- Go.
- What are you gonna do?

01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.855
It'll come to me.

01:00:27.775 --> 01:00:29.037
Counselor.

01:00:29.047 --> 01:00:31.214
I usually get a heads up when
you arrest one of my clients.

01:00:31.216 --> 01:00:33.683
Well, you lost that courtesy to
your family's criminal acts...

01:00:33.685 --> 01:00:36.552
Fraud, prostitution, blackmail, bigamy.

01:00:36.554 --> 01:00:40.210
Let your father know he should stay
out of North Carolina for a while.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.292
I'm no longer speaking to my father.

01:00:42.294 --> 01:00:44.527
Then that leaves brother Eric.
Cornell's bringing him in right now.

01:00:44.529 --> 01:00:45.929
Counselor.

01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:49.032
Well, now that we're all here,
let's get started.

01:00:54.872 --> 01:00:56.406
You all right, Ms. Warner?

01:00:56.408 --> 01:00:58.508
Never better. You?

01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:01.878
Heard you were having family
problems of your own.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.247
Arresting my brother for
the attempted murder

01:01:04.249 --> 01:01:06.149
of our mother is bogus.

01:01:06.151 --> 01:01:07.984
It was self defense.

01:01:07.986 --> 01:01:09.652
Oh, we'll get to that.

01:01:09.654 --> 01:01:11.721
Take me through your movements
the night of the party.

01:01:11.723 --> 01:01:13.489
Asked and answered.

01:01:13.491 --> 01:01:16.192
Kate's death has nothing to do with
what happened to Yvonne Warner.

01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:17.660
Goes to pattern, counselor.

01:01:17.662 --> 01:01:18.928
Eric Warner has a temper,

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.964
and when he snaps, sometimes people die.

01:01:20.966 --> 01:01:24.067
My mother was coming after me,
Eric stopped her.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.903
- There is no pattern.
- Then convince me.

01:01:26.905 --> 01:01:29.305
You think I want to put another
innocent man in prison?

01:01:29.307 --> 01:01:31.574
The smart play here is
to answer my questions.

01:01:31.576 --> 01:01:33.089
Up to you.

01:01:33.636 --> 01:01:35.244
What do you want to do?

01:01:38.248 --> 01:01:40.083
Let's get it over with.

01:01:40.085 --> 01:01:42.118
I'm tired, Mandy.

01:01:46.413 --> 01:01:50.360
Kate and I arrived at the
party around 10 to 7:00.

01:01:50.362 --> 01:01:51.861
When you're the host of the party,

01:01:51.863 --> 01:01:53.396
you don't get to have a good time.

01:02:10.782 --> 01:02:13.282
In 15 minutes,
I'm gonna say a few words,

01:02:13.284 --> 01:02:14.717
and then it's your turn.

01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:17.020
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:02:17.022 --> 01:02:19.022
I'm just hope I can make you proud, Dad.

01:02:19.024 --> 01:02:21.090
Hey, my oldest son followed my lead

01:02:21.092 --> 01:02:22.925
and now he is leading others.

01:02:22.927 --> 01:02:25.294
I'm already very proud.

01:02:26.028 --> 01:02:27.730
Where's my speech?

01:02:27.732 --> 01:02:30.885
- Doesn't Kate have the cards?
- Yes.

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:35.171
If only I'd looked for Kate sooner.

01:02:35.173 --> 01:02:36.957
What did you do next?

01:02:38.747 --> 01:02:41.411
Patrick was waiting for Liam
to bring him his liquor.

01:02:41.413 --> 01:02:42.745
Where was Kate?

01:02:44.249 --> 01:02:46.015
I don't know.

01:02:50.422 --> 01:02:52.455
What time was it, Eric?

01:02:53.456 --> 01:02:55.091
Around 9:30.

01:03:03.734 --> 01:03:05.668
Who didn't you see?

01:03:11.909 --> 01:03:14.410
Who didn't you see, Mr. Warner?

01:03:14.944 --> 01:03:16.112
Neil.

01:03:16.114 --> 01:03:17.701
He was in the garage with Carly.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.148
Who else was missing?

01:03:20.843 --> 01:03:22.185
Melanie.

01:03:22.187 --> 01:03:25.040
She was downstairs erasing
the security footage.

01:03:26.623 --> 01:03:29.225
Focus. Who didn't you see?

01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:35.698
Don't think.

01:03:36.615 --> 01:03:38.839
- Just say it.
- Amanda.

01:03:46.376 --> 01:03:48.392
Mandy, where were you?

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:54.717
I didn't think even you
could sink this low.

01:03:55.451 --> 01:03:57.720
Divide and conquer, is that the idea?

01:03:57.722 --> 01:03:58.988
Where were you?

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:01.090
I was mingling, just like everyone else.

01:04:01.092 --> 01:04:03.313
No, you weren't.

01:04:03.323 --> 01:04:07.663
You were on that roof with Kate,
and I have proof.

01:04:22.489 --> 01:04:25.264
Amanda, were you on the roof?

01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:28.834
Eric, this is exactly what she wants.

01:04:28.844 --> 01:04:31.611
Well, we need to hear
your side of the story.

01:04:31.613 --> 01:04:32.920
There is no side to tell.

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:34.696
You're still a sworn
officer of the court.

01:04:34.698 --> 01:04:38.431
If you lie, I'm gonna make sure you
serve every single day of your sentence.

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.960
Was it an accident,
or did you just lose control?

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.940
This is puerile
and clumsy, even for you.

01:04:44.942 --> 01:04:48.577
Do you really think you
can get me to confess?

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:50.524
Get you to what?

01:04:57.491 --> 01:04:59.721
Did you kill Kate?

01:05:03.773 --> 01:05:05.494
Eric.

01:05:06.244 --> 01:05:07.929
Kate went up on the roof with you,

01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:10.265
and then she told you she was pregnant.

01:05:10.267 --> 01:05:12.267
I didn't know she was pregnant.

01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:13.502
That's what set you off.

01:05:13.504 --> 01:05:15.570
You'd been trying to have
a baby for a long time.

01:05:15.572 --> 01:05:18.273
Greg left you because you
wouldn't stop trying.

01:05:18.275 --> 01:05:20.642
Okay, t-this proves nothing.

01:05:20.644 --> 01:05:22.811
Lots of women have fertility issues.

01:05:22.813 --> 01:05:25.193
Yes, but they don't kill people.

01:05:26.215 --> 01:05:31.586
Now, were these the clothes you
wore the night of the party?

01:05:31.588 --> 01:05:34.089
- That's what I gave you.
- These clothes were never worn.

01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:35.727
You replaced the outfit you threw away.

01:05:35.737 --> 01:05:39.294
If forensic tests show that I did
not wear them, they are mistaken.

01:05:39.296 --> 01:05:41.563
I already had them dry cleaned.

01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:44.165
You gave us the wrong jacket.

01:05:44.167 --> 01:05:47.260
Dry cleaners don't put beads
where there weren't any.

01:05:49.105 --> 01:05:51.306
You know that's not enough
for reasonable doubt.

01:05:51.738 --> 01:05:53.174
Your blood on the broken planter

01:05:53.176 --> 01:05:56.085
from your struggle with Kate...
That's all I need.

01:05:56.095 --> 01:05:57.445
How do you know it's my blood?

01:05:57.447 --> 01:06:00.980
We compared it to your cigarette
butts you left at work.

01:06:02.451 --> 01:06:04.019
If I had a fight with Kate,

01:06:04.021 --> 01:06:06.488
how come I don't have
any scratches on me?

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:09.691
Kate struck you in the nose or mouth.

01:06:09.693 --> 01:06:13.134
They're both profusive bleeders,
rarely leaving a mark.

01:06:13.144 --> 01:06:14.563
Tell me.

01:06:15.024 --> 01:06:16.631
Tell me right now.

01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:18.967
I want to hear you say it.

01:06:18.969 --> 01:06:21.573
Tell me you didn't kill Kate.
Please, tell me.

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:23.371
I didn't.

01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:25.273
I...

01:06:25.596 --> 01:06:26.990
I didn't.

01:06:34.311 --> 01:06:37.196
Eric doesn't need to be here for this.

01:06:39.088 --> 01:06:41.222
After everything that
you have put me through,

01:06:41.224 --> 01:06:44.125
I deserve to hear what
you did to my wife.

01:06:46.944 --> 01:06:49.926
No, no, no. P-please.
Please don't do that.

01:06:50.968 --> 01:06:52.334
Why not?

01:06:52.977 --> 01:06:55.470
Um, the smoke... It makes me sick.

01:06:55.748 --> 01:06:58.106
Everything makes me sick right now.

01:07:00.587 --> 01:07:02.677
What is going on?

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:04.980
Let's talk about it tomorrow, okay?

01:07:05.453 --> 01:07:07.633
If I get into it now, I...

01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:11.258
I don't want to ruin Eric's moment.

01:07:11.946 --> 01:07:13.154
Okay.

01:07:13.156 --> 01:07:14.889
There's so much I need to tell him,

01:07:14.891 --> 01:07:17.626
but he's taking over the company
and he's gonna be a father,

01:07:17.628 --> 01:07:21.463
and why is everyone trying
to steal our damn joy?

01:07:31.361 --> 01:07:32.877
You're pregnant?

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.874
I wasn't trying. It just happened.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.231
Look, forget you even heard that, okay?

01:07:41.233 --> 01:07:42.632
Please, we're not even supposed

01:07:42.634 --> 01:07:45.502
to tell anyone till we're,
like, 12 weeks in. Please?

01:07:48.006 --> 01:07:50.006
Look, I'm sorry, I was just downloading.

01:07:50.008 --> 01:07:51.141
Don't!

01:07:51.143 --> 01:07:53.443
Don't. This is all so wrong.

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:55.278
This is...

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.545
- What is?
- You're having a baby?

01:07:57.555 --> 01:07:58.915
- This is just a mistake.
- Hey, come on...

01:07:58.917 --> 01:08:01.651
Don't! Get off of me!

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.734
What is wrong with you?

01:08:04.423 --> 01:08:06.623
What's wrong with me?

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:09.259
What's wrong with me?!

01:08:09.261 --> 01:08:10.994
You are having a baby

01:08:10.996 --> 01:08:12.829
and you haven't even been trying!

01:08:12.831 --> 01:08:15.098
Do you know how badly...

01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:49.249
No.

01:08:52.069 --> 01:08:53.636
No.

01:09:37.481 --> 01:09:39.115
It's okay.

01:09:51.067 --> 01:09:53.341
I didn't mean to kill her.

01:09:53.352 --> 01:09:55.832
It just happened.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:01.039
- I loved Kate so mu...
- Stop talking.

01:10:05.977 --> 01:10:07.744
You don't love anyone but yourself.

01:10:07.746 --> 01:10:10.513
That is not true.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.851
You took my wife,

01:10:14.853 --> 01:10:19.723
you took my child, and you
lied to my face for weeks.

01:10:20.934 --> 01:10:23.640
- I'm so s...
- Shut up!

01:10:32.015 --> 01:10:34.638
This is a warrant for my medication?

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.973
Why do you need this?

01:10:40.498 --> 01:10:41.822
What are the pills for?

01:10:44.037 --> 01:10:46.716
Seems I can't have any children

01:10:47.081 --> 01:10:50.020
because I am going into menopause.

01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:55.892
I'm 33 years old and they told
me that I am no longer a woman.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.530
They were wrong.

01:10:59.077 --> 01:11:00.130
What?

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:02.647
I had your blood tested
for fertility drugs,

01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:05.135
but I also found high levels of HCG.

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:07.783
I know you didn't know this,
'cause you were smoking.

01:11:07.793 --> 01:11:09.919
You're pregnant.

01:11:30.526 --> 01:11:32.618
Mr. Warner, let's go.

01:11:40.299 --> 01:11:44.074
Do you have any idea

01:11:44.076 --> 01:11:46.676
how much I want to hurt you?

01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:07.413
We're not charging you for the
attempt on your mother's life.

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:11.158
Cornell was able to pull all
of your pediatric x-rays.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.428
The spiral fractures prove
that you were abused.

01:12:14.862 --> 01:12:17.146
We know a lot more about child
abuse now than we used to.

01:12:17.156 --> 01:12:20.376
If you already knew that,
then why put me through this?

01:12:20.386 --> 01:12:22.369
We needed Amanda's confession.

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.898
I'm sorry we had to do it this way,

01:12:23.908 --> 01:12:26.440
but our goal was justice for Kate.

01:12:27.148 --> 01:12:28.466
Listen.

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:33.614
I need to tell you your
sister will mount a defense.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:34.982
What does that mean?

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:37.785
She was taking a lot of
medications, including hormones.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.353
She could claim diminished capacity.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.188
No, you can't let her do that.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.891
Self preservation is human nature,

01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:44.600
and Amanda's entitled to a defense.

01:12:44.602 --> 01:12:47.503
Unfortunately, her strategy could
be creating a media circus.

01:12:47.505 --> 01:12:49.620
And with the brothel and
the two Mrs. Warners,

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:51.073
- she's gonna get one.
- No, I can't.

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.209
I cannot relive this nightmare.

01:12:53.211 --> 01:12:55.077
Do you understand? I can not.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:57.470
Unless you can convince
her to plead guilty,

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.180
you need to prepare
yourself for the worst.

01:13:10.975 --> 01:13:12.895
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:13:17.534 --> 01:13:19.368
Which one?

01:13:25.108 --> 01:13:28.010
Someone has to take care of that baby.

01:13:29.592 --> 01:13:32.849
I'm thinking that someone
should be its father.

01:13:34.153 --> 01:13:36.586
You don't have to worry about the baby.

01:13:36.588 --> 01:13:39.422
I'm... I'm gonna be a good dad.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.126
Yeah, I-I know when you called, I-I...

01:13:44.538 --> 01:13:47.330
This... this was a lot to process.

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.533
But once it... It finally sunk in...

01:13:52.603 --> 01:13:54.537
I'm good.

01:13:54.539 --> 01:13:56.339
You tell her I'm not running.

01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:57.840
I'm stepping up.

01:13:57.842 --> 01:13:59.575
She should hear that from you.

01:14:01.845 --> 01:14:04.013
I'm gonna see her later.

01:14:04.015 --> 01:14:06.649
You can meet me at the jail at 4:00.

01:14:27.437 --> 01:14:30.172
Hi, this is Neil Oliver.
I'm not available right now,

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:32.942
but if you leave a detailed message,
I'll get back to you as...

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.015
Selfish bastard.

01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:41.643
Mr. Warner?

01:14:52.261 --> 01:14:53.902
I, um...

01:14:55.208 --> 01:14:57.300
I asked that we be in
the attorney's room

01:14:57.302 --> 01:14:59.789
- so we could have privacy.
- Why?

01:14:59.799 --> 01:15:02.806
So you can run down
your defense strategy?

01:15:02.816 --> 01:15:05.474
Diminished capacity 'cause of your meds?

01:15:07.978 --> 01:15:10.680
- You don't understand...
- Don't bother.

01:15:11.187 --> 01:15:14.250
Prosecutor laid it out for me.

01:15:14.252 --> 01:15:16.419
Besides, I...

01:15:16.421 --> 01:15:19.294
Want it to be fresh when
I hear it at your trial.

01:15:19.304 --> 01:15:21.624
There won't be a trial.

01:15:22.728 --> 01:15:24.483
I'm pleading guilty.

01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:36.824
You killed my wife and
lied to me for a month.

01:15:38.308 --> 01:15:41.644
You let me go crazy
wondering who she was,

01:15:41.646 --> 01:15:45.114
what she was hiding,
if my marriage was real!

01:15:46.212 --> 01:15:47.450
You pretended to protect me

01:15:47.452 --> 01:15:51.220
when you were just protecting
yourself, and now...

01:15:51.222 --> 01:15:52.822
Now you just want to plead guilty

01:15:52.824 --> 01:15:54.590
and just go quietly off to prison.

01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:56.726
That's what you're saying?

01:15:57.861 --> 01:15:59.362
Answer me!

01:16:02.901 --> 01:16:04.312
Yes.

01:16:16.146 --> 01:16:18.514
Oh, gosh.

01:16:22.019 --> 01:16:23.686
You want me to take the baby.

01:16:23.688 --> 01:16:25.889
- That's not the only reas...
- Stop.

01:16:30.627 --> 01:16:34.930
How can you expect me
to take your child,

01:16:34.932 --> 01:16:37.667
raise your child, when you killed mine?

01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:40.870
Because I know Neil
is not gonna step up.

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.174
And despite what I've done...

01:16:46.706 --> 01:16:48.878
My child is innocent.

01:16:51.449 --> 01:16:55.051
Do you really think it
deserves to be in the system?

01:16:55.053 --> 01:16:56.719
I don't care,

01:16:56.721 --> 01:16:58.207
because I didn't put him there.

01:16:58.217 --> 01:16:59.661
Maybe...

01:17:01.558 --> 01:17:03.526
But this baby is your family.

01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:10.066
It shouldn't suffer for my sins

01:17:10.068 --> 01:17:13.669
any more than we should've
for our parents'.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:20.242
I am asking you...

01:17:20.653 --> 01:17:23.388
I am begging you...

01:17:25.178 --> 01:17:27.216
To please take this child.

01:17:41.164 --> 01:17:44.593
There is no other detective
who is more insubordinate.

01:17:45.402 --> 01:17:49.238
There's also no other detective
who could've solved this case.

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.460
I'm proud to have you in my unit.

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:53.462
I appreciate that, sir.

01:17:54.098 --> 01:17:55.598
Justice be done.

01:18:14.564 --> 01:18:17.334
My public defender
told me what happened.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:20.027
I never would've thought Mandy would...

01:18:20.037 --> 01:18:21.360
Me either.

01:18:24.674 --> 01:18:27.774
I almost called Dad to tell
him he should be proud.

01:18:29.391 --> 01:18:31.213
All four of his kids are criminals.

01:18:34.252 --> 01:18:35.751
What the hell was he thinking, man?

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.119
It's all right. It's all right.

01:18:37.121 --> 01:18:41.223
He doesn't have us anymore,
and he definitely doesn't have SEG.

01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:43.259
How did you manage that?

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:49.799
Our father used our mother's
trust to build the firm,

01:18:50.453 --> 01:18:53.469
so since he married Corinne first...

01:18:53.471 --> 01:18:56.121
Which makes us bastards, by the way.

01:18:57.744 --> 01:19:00.743
He wasn't legally married to Mom,

01:19:00.745 --> 01:19:03.412
so he wasn't entitled to her money.

01:19:05.482 --> 01:19:08.203
The thing is, he doesn't matter anymore.

01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:09.952
You do.

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:15.248
I'm so sorry, Eric.

01:19:16.527 --> 01:19:18.727
I resented you for so long.

01:19:18.729 --> 01:19:22.836
I blamed you for everything,
and none of it was your fault.

01:19:23.867 --> 01:19:26.001
I'm going to jail for poor judgement

01:19:26.003 --> 01:19:28.166
and the choices that I made.

01:19:29.958 --> 01:19:32.374
Come to think of it,
it's the exact same reason

01:19:32.376 --> 01:19:35.144
that I'm getting a divorce.

01:19:43.354 --> 01:19:46.355
I'm making a list of things about
Patrick that I want to examine

01:19:46.357 --> 01:19:48.413
while I'm doing my 20 years in the hole.

01:19:53.563 --> 01:19:58.100
Y-y-you're doing 18-36 months
in a minimum-security prison.

01:19:59.665 --> 01:20:01.474
They call it Camp Snoopy.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.447
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

01:20:15.252 --> 01:20:18.754
Take SEG apart...

01:20:19.783 --> 01:20:21.733
And start over.

01:20:24.242 --> 01:20:27.196
It's been 14 hours since I had a drink.

01:20:30.023 --> 01:20:31.910
I'm gonna do better.

01:20:32.324 --> 01:20:33.912
I promise.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.008
Just don't give up on me.

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:42.411
Never.

01:21:30.703 --> 01:21:34.127
_

01:21:55.651 --> 01:21:58.006
_

01:22:08.499 --> 01:22:11.533
How many do you want?

01:22:11.535 --> 01:22:15.771
Well, you know, I know you have
to do the heavy lifting, so...

01:22:15.773 --> 01:22:17.639
How many do you want?

01:22:19.095 --> 01:22:22.801
Well, I was an only child,
so at least two.

01:22:23.646 --> 01:22:25.748
And we could always adopt.

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:29.051
You know, there are plenty of
kids out there who need love.

01:22:29.053 --> 01:22:31.687
Sure, yeah, we just need a...
Need a bigger place.

01:22:31.689 --> 01:22:34.490
You're the boss.

01:23:03.498 --> 01:23:06.588
Hey, Charlie, how you doing? It's Eric.

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.668
Jennifer.

01:23:53.369 --> 01:23:54.736
What are you doing?

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.538
Hi, Mom.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:03.747
Are you high?

01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:10.152
Jennifer?

01:24:10.154 --> 01:24:11.720
Where's my gun?
