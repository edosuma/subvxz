00:03.504 --> 00:05.836
( crickets chirping )

00:11.470 --> 00:15.258
(faint snarling )

00:17.768 --> 00:20.054
(snarling )

00:22.899 --> 00:25.265
(squeaking )

00:33.284 --> 00:35.525
(crunching, squealing)

00:48.883 --> 00:50.464
What are you thinking about?

00:50.635 --> 00:52.296
Yesterday.

00:52.470 --> 00:55.587
Zack. I can't stop.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.053
Yeah, me neither.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.595
It used to be we all
had acquaintances.

01:03.773 --> 01:06.059
Just people moving
in and out of your life.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.099
No big.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.394
See them down
the road sometime.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.858
Now...

01:14.033 --> 01:16.649
a handful of people
you know,

01:16.827 --> 01:18.863
and that's it.

01:19.038 --> 01:22.530
They might as well be the only people
left in the world.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.533
Am I talking too much?

01:25.711 --> 01:27.087
A little, but I like it.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.496
( laughs)

01:33.886 --> 01:37.595
J‘ I got you J‘

01:37.765 --> 01:40.677
- J‘ Under my skin... J‘
-Mmmm

01:42.311 --> 01:45.098
- J‘ I got you... J‘
-( laughs)

01:45.273 --> 01:47.559
J‘ Deep in
the heart of me... J‘

01:47.733 --> 01:49.985
Okay, now you're just
embarrassing me.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.110
J‘ So deep in my heart J‘

01:53.281 --> 01:56.899
J‘ That you are really
a part of me. J‘

01:59.412 --> 02:01.653
I got you.

02:02.665 --> 02:05.657
We should probably try
to get some rest.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.956
Yeah.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.292
Hey, come crash at my place.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.502
( laughs)

02:14.677 --> 02:17.885
Okay, I'll crash
at your place, then.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.797
You know we start doing that,
we're not gonna want to stop.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.059
Not just yet.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.470
Yeah.

02:40.036 --> 02:42.618
Good night.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.331
(tapping )

03:10.524 --> 03:12.480
(splashing )

03:13.527 --> 03:15.609
( distant rattling )

03:37.510 --> 03:39.751
(faint dripping)

04:00.574 --> 04:03.566
(snarling )

04:26.434 --> 04:29.016
( snarling softly )

04:42.450 --> 04:44.566
( snarling softly )

04:53.711 --> 04:56.418
(man coughing)

04:59.717 --> 05:01.833
(snoring within)

05:08.642 --> 05:10.724
(gurgling)

05:20.070 --> 05:22.197
( snarling softly )

05:28.120 --> 05:30.361
(theme music playing )

06:05.157 --> 06:05.236
(squishing)

06:05.241 --> 06:08.825
(squishing)

06:11.580 --> 06:15.539
(faint ticking )

06:15.709 --> 06:17.870
(bell ringing)

06:20.881 --> 06:23.213
(ringing)

06:23.384 --> 06:24.840
( stops )

06:27.680 --> 06:29.545
Carl?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.463
Carl.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.724
Come on.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.104
(man coughing)

06:44.905 --> 06:47.612
(snarling )

06:50.828 --> 06:53.240
(moaning)

06:55.332 --> 06:57.448
(snarling )

07:08.512 --> 07:09.718
( splatters )

07:09.888 --> 07:11.503
( growls )

07:53.057 --> 07:54.593
( camera clicks )

07:54.767 --> 07:56.803
(flash whines,
camera whirring )

07:56.977 --> 07:59.218
( laughs )
Sorry.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.352
Changing of the guard?

08:07.696 --> 08:10.108
Yeah.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.274
I'll bring you breakfast
after perimeter check.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.489
Oh, my God.
Throw that away.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.158
Yeah.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.667
Not gonna happen.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.668
lt's mine.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.098
( hatch creaks )

08:53.534 --> 08:54.865
Rick:
Careful out there.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.777
Michonne:
Always am. Any requests?

08:57.955 --> 09:01.288
Books? Comics?
Some stale M&Ms?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.244
You're the one that likes stale M&Ms.

09:03.419 --> 09:04.829
Then I'll definitely looking for some.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.380
I'll look for some stuff you like, too.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.713
Why don't you wear your hat anymore?

09:10.884 --> 09:14.502
It's not a farming hat.
See you soon?

09:14.680 --> 09:17.046
Pretty soon.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.550
(walkers growling )

09:32.322 --> 09:34.938
(fence creaking )

09:37.077 --> 09:39.409
They only took out
one cluster yesterday.

09:39.580 --> 09:43.323
Probably gonna need
more people today.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.491
Maybe we could help.

09:45.669 --> 09:50.254
I got other plans
involving dirt and cucumbers

09:50.424 --> 09:51.914
and keeping people fed.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.084
Well, if you don't want to,
maybe I could.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.931
Could I?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.558
We have other plans.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.936
That's what I should have said.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.901
(pigs grunting)

10:10.068 --> 10:12.559
Come on in.
There we go.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.571
Dad...?

10:20.746 --> 10:22.407
I'm sorry.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.242
I've been trying.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.499
Yeah, I know.
And I'm proud.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.913
Dad,

10:32.090 --> 10:34.046
when can I have
my gun back?

10:43.060 --> 10:45.176
Worms will give them
some extra protein.

10:45.354 --> 10:48.016
( distant gunfire
echoes)

10:49.316 --> 10:50.817
Stay close.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.896
Help! Help!
Please, come quick!

10:54.071 --> 10:56.562
- Cell block?
- I don't know.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.026
Get in the tower with Maggie.
Don't argue, go.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.571
- Walkers in D!
- What about C?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.159
Clear. We locked the gates
to the tombs.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.995
- Hershel's on guard.
- It ain't a breach.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.080
Sasha:
We followed the plan.

11:13.006 --> 11:13.995
( whistles )

11:19.513 --> 11:21.674
( creaks )

11:22.891 --> 11:24.051
(snarling )

11:26.520 --> 11:28.351
Whoa, boy.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.110
Maggie:
Hold on!

11:46.123 --> 11:47.488
(grunts)

11:57.593 --> 11:59.504
( groans )

12:03.223 --> 12:04.338
Come here.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.176
( groans )

12:11.523 --> 12:13.900
(all snarling)

12:19.615 --> 12:20.695
( people screaming )

12:20.866 --> 12:22.276
- Move!
- Daryl!

12:22.451 --> 12:24.237
I got it.
Are you bit?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.242
Go. Get out of here.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.574
Hold that.
Go, go.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.240
Are you bit?
All right, go.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.293
Gaup
Get back in the cell.

12:38.008 --> 12:38.997
Here.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.875
(Carol yelling)

12:42.971 --> 12:45.587
Come with me.
Stay in there.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.097
Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

12:47.267 --> 12:48.382
(sobbing )

12:48.560 --> 12:50.676
Got you.
Go!

12:50.854 --> 12:52.094
(groaning)

12:54.149 --> 12:57.562
Karen! Karen!

12:57.736 --> 12:58.942
- Are you okay?
- You all right?

13:00.781 --> 13:03.614
- Just stay calm.
- ( groaning )

13:06.203 --> 13:08.194
I'm gonna have to
amputate your arm

13:08.372 --> 13:10.988
to stop the infection
from spreading.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.248
- ( snarling )
- Rick: Check all of 'em-- every cell.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.204
l have to do it now.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.461
I want you to bite this.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.803
- Are we clear down here?
- Yeah.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.510
- We're safe?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.265
Man:
Up here!

13:30.435 --> 13:32.221
- ( sobbing )
- It's okay.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.226
(growling)

13:41.405 --> 13:42.986
Get down!

13:48.412 --> 13:50.494
Thanks.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.203
Oh, it's Patrick.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.673
Daryl:
That's all of 'em.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.604
I got it.

15:15.957 --> 15:19.085
(sobbing )

15:26.093 --> 15:28.254
( panting )
Whew...

15:28.428 --> 15:30.510
lt's happening, isn't it?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.136
You're in shock, okay?

15:32.307 --> 15:34.673
I want you just to lay back.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.438
Lizzie and Mica,

15:42.609 --> 15:44.770
you care about them.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.651
I've seen it.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.146
I don't have anybody else.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.611
Kids on their own,

15:52.786 --> 15:55.277
they don't have a chance.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.542
Can you look out for them?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.745
Like they're yours?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.878
Yeah.

16:05.048 --> 16:08.540
Yeah, I can. lwill.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.635
( moans)

16:17.644 --> 16:20.010
Ryan.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.600
You're gonna have to
let them say goodbye.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.605
Okay?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.443
Okay.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.366
(snarling )

16:42.502 --> 16:43.833
(body thumps)

16:46.840 --> 16:49.172
( door opens)

16:53.346 --> 16:56.588
No bites. No wounds.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.506
lthink hejust died.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.848
Horribly, too.
Pleurisy aspiration.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.354
Choked to death
on his own blood.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.357
Caused those trails down his face.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.270
I've seen them before
on a walker outside the fences.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.359
I saw them on Patrick, too.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.740
They're from the internal
lung pressure building up--

17:15.911 --> 17:17.776
like if you shake
a soda can and pop the top.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.570
Only imagine your eyes,

17:20.749 --> 17:23.115
ears, nose, and throat
are the top.

17:23.293 --> 17:26.376
It's a sickness
from the walkers?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.207
No, these things happened
before they were around.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.791
Could be pneumococcal.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.376
Most likely an aggressive
flu strain.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.667
Someone locked him in
just in time.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.678
No, man.
Charlie used to sleepwalk.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.181
Locked himself in. Hell,
he was just eating barbecue yesterday.

17:40.352 --> 17:43.059
How could somebody die
in a day just from a cold?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.312
I had a sick pig,
it died quick.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.224
Saw a sick boar
in the woods.

17:48.401 --> 17:53.236
Pigs and birds. That's how these things
spread in the past.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.192
We need to do something
about those hogs.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.985
Maybe we got lucky.
Maybe these two cases are it.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.278
Haven't seen anybody
be lucky in a long time.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.493
Bugs like to run
through close quarters.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.704
Doesn't get any closer
than this.

18:06.878 --> 18:10.871
Hershel: All of us in here,
we've all been exposed.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.516
Mica:
Dad?

18:30.694 --> 18:33.401
We have to go get Dr. S.

18:33.571 --> 18:37.484
Honey, he's been bit.
The doctor won't help.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.951
You take care of your sister.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.216
Dad.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.799
Dad?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.348
- Dad?
- No.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.475
- Come on, it's time.
- No.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.227
You know what I have to do.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.309
What we're always supposed to do.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.394
You can wait outside
if you want.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.685
Okay?

19:19.451 --> 19:21.032
We should be the ones.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.822
No. I can't.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.291
Lizzie, are you sure?

19:30.462 --> 19:32.168
You taught us.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.421
- I can do it.
- Okay, well, you have to do it now.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.832
You need to do it right now because
you have to do it before he turns.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.841
I'm gonna stay right here.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.674
You remember
what I showed you?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.850
- ( gasping )
- ( knife clatters )

19:52.025 --> 19:54.516
Lizzie. Lizzie, Lizzie.
It's okay.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.355
It's okay.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.985
Lizzie? Lizzie,
it's okay. Breathe.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.613
Look at the flowers.
Count one, two, three with me.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.275
- One, two--
- Daddy, no!

20:03.453 --> 20:04.613
Mica:
No, Lizzie, look at the flowers.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.369
Count one, two,
three with me.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.916
- One, two, three.
- Look at the flowers, Lizzie.

20:09.084 --> 20:11.325
- No!
- Look at the flowers!

20:11.503 --> 20:13.869
(sobbing )

20:31.398 --> 20:33.229
Hey, you might
want to stay back.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.608
- Carl.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.689
I didn't see you come out.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.900
It's okay. I'm here.
I'm fine. But back away.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.316
I had to use one
of the guns by the gate.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.984
I swear
I didn't want to.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.949
l was coming back.
I fell.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.409
They came out
and helped me.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.835
Are you all right?

20:53.002 --> 20:55.084
What happened in there?

21:05.390 --> 21:07.426
Patrick got sick last night.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.761
It's some kind of flu.
It moves fast.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.097
We think he died
and attacked the cell block.

21:12.272 --> 21:15.230
Look, I know he was your friend
and I'm sorry.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.561
He was a good kid.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.441
We lost a lot of good people.

21:21.739 --> 21:25.732
Glenn and your dad are okay,
but they were in there.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.322
You shouldn't get too close to anyone
that might have been exposed,

21:28.496 --> 21:31.533
at least for a little while.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.700
Carl. All of you.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.830
Patrick was fine yesterday,

21:40.008 --> 21:41.964
and he died overnight.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.251
Two people died that quick?

21:46.347 --> 21:48.838
We'll have to separate
everyone that's been exposed.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.882
That's everyone in that cell block.

21:51.060 --> 21:54.052
That's all of us.
Maybe more.

21:55.773 --> 21:58.901
We know that this sickness
can be lethal.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.981
We don't know how easily
it spreads.

22:03.156 --> 22:06.068
Is anyone else showing symptoms
that we know of?

22:06.242 --> 22:08.824
We can't just wait and see.
There's children.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.701
lt isn'tjust the illness.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.828
If people die,
they become a threat.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.159
We need a place for them to go.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.827
They can't stay in D.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.337
We can't risk going in
there to clean it up.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.964
We can use cell block A.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.874
Death row?

22:25.053 --> 22:27.009
I'm not sure
that's much of an upgrade.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.637
Daryl: It's clean.
That's an upgrade.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.798
Think that'll work
for Dr. S?

22:31.976 --> 22:33.932
I'll help Caleb get it set up.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.186
(woman coughing)

22:39.192 --> 22:41.524
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.362
You sure?
You don't sound so good.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.899
We're just taking her back
to my cell so she can rest.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.864
Tyreese, I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.529
Why?
What's going on now?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.537
We think it's a flu
or something.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.576
That's how Patrick died.

23:00.755 --> 23:02.120
Judith was in that cell block.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.380
She's vulnerable.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.711
Anyone that may be sick

23:05.885 --> 23:08.297
or even exposed should stay away.

23:08.471 --> 23:09.551
lt killed Patrick?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.587
Tyreese: She's gonna be okay.

23:11.766 --> 23:15.350
Now that we know what Patrick died from
we can treat it, right?

23:15.520 --> 23:17.511
Don't panic.
We're going to figure this out.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.351
But we should keep you
separated in the meantime.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.561
We'll have Caleb
take a look at you.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.351
I'll see what we have
in the way of medications.

23:25.530 --> 23:29.864
David from the Decatur group,
he's been coughing, too.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.025
Glenn:
I'll get him.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.819
There's some empty clean
cells in the tombs, right?

23:34.998 --> 23:36.329
- Yeah, we'll meet you there.
- Okay.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.040
Come on.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.497
Let's get you settled.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.921
Have to call another meeting later.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.676
All right.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.883
I'll get to burying
the dead ones.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.763
You wear gloves
and a mask.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.141
Uh-huh.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.764
You all right?

24:02.942 --> 24:05.524
I'm worried about Lizzie and Mica.
They were around Patrick.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.777
We all were.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.280
Karen and David are gonna be separated
till they feel better.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.942
You're right.
Are you okay?

24:16.164 --> 24:19.406
Mm-hmm. Got to be.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.795
(snarling )

24:31.304 --> 24:33.295
Gonna bury your dad.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.632
You can visit,
bring him flowers.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.971
Lizzie, we're gonna have to talk
about what happened in there.

24:51.574 --> 24:55.487
Your daddy asked me to protect you
like you're my own and I will.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.612
It's time someone
told you the truth.

25:01.876 --> 25:04.037
Honey, you're weak.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.669
- ( sniffles )
- You lost your nerve.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.672
You have to trust your gut and you have
to act fast every time.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.833
That's life and death.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.174
He's dead.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.510
I know, and I'm sorry.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.890
But if you want to live,
you have to become strong.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.930
He's dead.
He's dead.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.395
He was special
and now he's dead.

25:28.569 --> 25:32.653
Why'd they kill him?
Why'd they kill Nick?

25:33.658 --> 25:35.148
You're so stupid.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.069
Nick?

25:41.207 --> 25:43.414
She's messed up.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.916
She's not weak.

26:03.104 --> 26:06.187
Glad you were in there.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.018
Wasn't much use
without my gun.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.729
No, you were.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.229
All this time
you've been taking off,

26:14.407 --> 26:16.568
you earned it.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.233
We wouldn't be here
without you.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.743
It was all of us.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.076
No, it was you first.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.707
You gonna help us
figure this out?

26:27.754 --> 26:31.167
I screwed up
too many times.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.468
Those calls you got to make,
| start down that road...

26:34.635 --> 26:37.923
I almost lost my boy--
who he was.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.924
Whatever else this place needs,
I'm here for it.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.603
Like I said,
you earned it.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.228
But for what it's worth,
you see mistakes.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.935
| see when the shit hits,

26:50.109 --> 26:51.849
you're standing there
with a shovel.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.863
Rick! Daryl!

26:58.743 --> 27:00.108
Oh, shit.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.745
(growling)

27:11.923 --> 27:15.290
The noise drew 'em out
and now this part's starting to give.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.844
(snarling )

27:39.951 --> 27:41.737
( rattling )

27:49.001 --> 27:51.037
(grunts)

28:03.516 --> 28:05.052
Did you see anything?

28:05.226 --> 28:07.808
They just started
taking out the dead.

28:07.979 --> 28:11.312
I don't need to know who yet.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.722
I don't want to.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.277
I'm glad you came back safe.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.696
It was stupid.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.071
l was so stupid.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.033
When I fell on my ass,
they should have just left me out there.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.194
Now that's stupid.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.697
We care about you.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.537
They could have gotten hurt.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.497
When you care about people

28:33.671 --> 28:36.208
hurt is kind of part of the package.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.889
Were there any kids?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.015
(Judith fussing )

28:49.186 --> 28:51.768
Got all these widows
and orphans,

28:51.939 --> 28:55.727
but what do you call
someone who lost a child?

28:57.194 --> 28:59.059
You'd think someone would
have given that a name.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.571
(Judith crying)

29:07.914 --> 29:09.745
Are you okay?

29:09.916 --> 29:11.452
Does she always cry like that?

29:11.626 --> 29:14.117
I think she senses people's moods.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.411
(crying continues)

29:20.092 --> 29:21.628
(snarling )

29:27.266 --> 29:29.382
(yelpsl

29:33.272 --> 29:35.137
Don't.

29:35.316 --> 29:37.932
We're supposed to stay
away from each other.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.193
Are you seeing this?

29:45.993 --> 29:47.108
ls someone feeding these things?

29:49.288 --> 29:52.451
- Heads up.
- This part of the fence, now!

29:53.876 --> 29:55.241
( creaking )

29:55.419 --> 29:57.284
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hey, hey.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.546
It's gonna give!
It's gonna give!

30:12.853 --> 30:14.980
( screams )

30:15.147 --> 30:17.638
Everybody back!
Come on, back, now.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.361
Fence keeps bending in like that,
those walkers are coming over it.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.072
Daryl, get the truck.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.787
I know what to do.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.224
You know if Patrick was Catholic?

30:55.354 --> 30:58.266
He said he was a practicing atheist.

31:04.822 --> 31:08.565
Did you tell your dad what you saw
in the library yesterday?

31:09.827 --> 31:11.909
Nope.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.037
Are you going to tell him?

31:19.754 --> 31:22.837
l have to keep teaching
those kids to survive.

31:23.007 --> 31:25.464
You know that.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.467
Did you tell their parents?

31:29.472 --> 31:30.552
No.

31:30.723 --> 31:33.510
Are you gonna tell them?

31:33.684 --> 31:36.676
If I do, maybe after this
they'll understand.

31:36.854 --> 31:39.436
But maybe they won't.
I don't want to take that risk.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.973
That's between you and them.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.490
No.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.867
lt's between you and me.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.655
If you tell your dad,
he'll tell them.

31:57.833 --> 32:01.075
And like I said, maybe
they'll understand, maybe they won't.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.665
I don't want to lie to my dad.

32:04.882 --> 32:07.419
I'm not asking you to lie.

32:09.136 --> 32:12.754
I'm asking you not to say anything.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.724
Beth:
J‘ Lying in my bed at night J‘

32:17.895 --> 32:19.806
J‘ I don't want to grow up J‘

32:19.980 --> 32:22.357
J‘ Nothing ever seems
to turn out right J‘

32:22.525 --> 32:24.436
J‘ I don't want to grow up J‘

32:24.610 --> 32:26.942
J‘ How do you live
in a world of fog? J‘

32:27.113 --> 32:29.695
J‘ It's always
changing things J‘

32:29.865 --> 32:33.983
J‘ Makes me wish
that I could be a dog J‘

32:34.161 --> 32:36.743
J‘ Oh, when | see
the price you pay J‘

32:36.914 --> 32:38.654
J‘ I don't want to grow up J‘

32:38.833 --> 32:41.290
J‘ Nothing ever seems
to go my way J‘

32:41.460 --> 32:43.200
J‘ I don't want to grow up J‘

32:43.379 --> 32:46.792
J‘ Only thing to live for
is today-- J‘

32:47.842 --> 32:50.379
Some lullaby.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.009
ljust sing her what I like.

32:52.179 --> 32:53.919
(Judith moaning)

32:54.098 --> 32:57.636
Figure it's better than ashes
or cradles falling out of trees.

32:57.810 --> 33:00.677
(crying, sputters)

33:00.855 --> 33:04.188
Oh, shoot.
Can you hold her a second?

33:04.358 --> 33:06.269
- Please, I'm covered in carrots.
- No.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.820
(Judith crying)

33:15.536 --> 33:16.776
Thanks.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.078
(crying)

33:59.538 --> 34:01.654
- ( grunts )
- ( gate creaks )

34:12.384 --> 34:14.500
(walkers snarling )

34:21.894 --> 34:23.805
Ready?

34:32.196 --> 34:34.312
(snarling )

34:45.876 --> 34:47.286
Let's go.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.793
(squealing)

35:00.933 --> 35:03.470
(squealing)

35:03.644 --> 35:05.100
Go!

35:18.367 --> 35:20.323
All right!
Hold up!

35:27.209 --> 35:29.450
(squealing)

35:32.423 --> 35:34.288
(squealing)

35:34.466 --> 35:36.878
All right, go.
Go.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.976
(squealing)

36:25.851 --> 36:25.930
(growling)

36:25.934 --> 36:28.846
(growling)

36:36.445 --> 36:37.855
Lizzie, those are walkers.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.105
Nick was a walker.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.774
You don't feel bad
about that walker dying.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.489
You feel bad about your dad.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.331
You loved him
and he's gone.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.666
Yeah.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.130
(snarling )

37:14.233 --> 37:16.064
There.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.462
( clatters )

37:47.891 --> 37:49.097
Not this time.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.477
( clatters )

37:54.648 --> 37:56.934
Think the pigs made them sick?

37:57.109 --> 37:59.771
Or we made the pigs sick.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.310
( clatters )

38:01.488 --> 38:04.275
I think we should stay
away from Judy a while.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.486
- Just in case.
- Okay.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.993
- I don't like it, but--
- We have to protect her.

38:11.874 --> 38:14.115
Yes, we do.

38:15.836 --> 38:18.122
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

38:18.297 --> 38:21.664
Carol's been teaching the kids...

38:21.842 --> 38:24.800
( sighs )
how to use weapons.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.677
How to kill.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.134
Their parents don't know

38:30.309 --> 38:32.925
and she doesn't want you to know.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.482
I think you should let her.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.231
I know you're gonna say
it's not up to you.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.983
But it can be.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.918
Dad?

38:57.085 --> 38:58.871
Thank you for telling me.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.872
Yeah.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.641
I won't stop her.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.063
I won't say anything.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.777
( crackling )

39:41.797 --> 39:43.412
Carl?

41:01.043 --> 41:03.659
(growling)
