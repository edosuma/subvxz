<i> It has been 23 days.</i>

<i> 23 days since the landing</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:11.944
<i> of Regis Air flight 753</i>
<i> transfixed the world.</i>

00:11.946 --> 00:16.115
<i> Our response to the threat</i>
<i> was needlessly delayed</i>

00:16.117 --> 00:18.550
<i> by indulgence</i>
<i> in political debates,</i>

00:18.552 --> 00:20.786
<i> media distractions,</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:24.456
<i> punditry and grandstanding.</i>

00:24.458 --> 00:27.960
<i> The quarantine in New York</i>
<i> was a moderate success,</i>

00:27.962 --> 00:31.897
<i> but locking predators in</i>
<i> with a reliable source of food</i>

00:31.899 --> 00:34.700

<i> evolve more quickly.</i>

00:34.702 --> 00:39.004
<i> Isolating the plague helped it</i>
<i> to burn more brightly.</i>

00:39.006 --> 00:41.640
<i> The United States</i>
<i> announced plans</i>

00:41.642 --> 00:45.010
<i> for a massive surge deployment</i>
<i> of National Guard troops</i>

00:45.012 --> 00:47.046

00:47.048 --> 00:51.216
<i> to push into New York City and</i>
<i> wipe out the infected enemy.</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:54.853
<i> But when new outbreaks</i>
<i> occurred in other cities,</i>

00:54.855 --> 00:57.189
<i> military support</i>
<i> was redistributed</i>

00:57.191 --> 00:59.758
<i> to other population centers</i>
<i> in the hope of halting</i>

00:59.760 --> 01:03.562
<i> the spread of the disease and,</i>
<i> just as importantly,</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:05.597
<i> the spread of panic.</i>

01:05.599 --> 01:08.767
<i> The invading presence</i>
<i> was a far graver threat</i>

01:08.769 --> 01:12.271
<i> than anyone ever</i>
<i> imagined. If humanity</i>

01:12.273 --> 01:14.273

The message is that we are
winning. But the truth is,

10:15.482 --> 10:17.782
we don't have the manpower.
At this current casualty rate,

10:17.784 --> 10:20.218

10:30.897 --> 10:33.832
Maybe we didn't get
a big enough sample size.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.935

It should be lethal. Always.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.137

more of your weapon

10:39.139 --> 10:42.974

Or I need a new plan.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.176

10:45.178 --> 10:48.847
are cops and citizens

big nests near Chinatown.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.347
These munchers
are getting faster.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.316
- (quietly): I need more help.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.552
Is there any way that
we can convince them

14:47.554 --> 14:50.922
to change their mission?
To help me secure Manhattan?

14:50.924 --> 14:53.358
Any way we can get them
to call in reinforcements?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.561
- I don't think so.
I'm just like a translator

14:56.563 --> 14:58.563

I speak New York City.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.900
Other than that, these guys
are doing their own thing.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.894
(muffled yelling)

18:53.933 --> 18:56.634
(groaning)

19:16.356 --> 19:18.990
(panting)

19:18.992 --> 19:21.959
(snarling)

19:21.961 --> 19:24.028
- Mama.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.298
Mama. Mama, it's OK. I just
wanna give you this. Look.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.966
I just wanna
give you this. Look.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.269
I know you're hungry, OK?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.337
Just relax, alright? Here.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.107
I just wanna give it to you. OK?
(shrieking)

19:36.109 --> 19:39.310
Mom! Mom, please! Mom!

19:39.312 --> 19:43.347
Mom, relax, OK? Here.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.850
(slurping)

19:55.361 --> 19:59.030
That's all I got.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.699
(growling)

20:01.701 --> 20:05.836
I know you hear me.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.039
I will get them back
for what they did to us.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.475
OK? I promise.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.255
(growling)

20:31.331 --> 20:33.231
- My name is Lar.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.567
- A sun-hunter.
- I speak for them.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.938
- I don't care who speaks as
long as they do the listening.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.014
- We are surprised to see you.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.084
- You think me a traitor
because for the moment

20:53.086 --> 20:55.353
I have thrown my lot in with
the cattle. But you should know

20:55.355 --> 20:58.556
better than anyone;
I have no allegiances,

20:58.558 --> 21:00.424
only an enemy.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.294
- Is that how you
justify your thievery?

21:03.296 --> 21:07.198
- I'm taking action. Unlike you,
who lurk in your chamber,

21:07.200 --> 21:09.900
paralyzed by a truce
that has lasted centuries

21:09.902 --> 21:12.069
and has now been broken.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.873
You have grown indolent.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.643
What became of the Ancients
from the Old World?

21:18.645 --> 21:21.245
The rest of the seven?
- We have not had

21:21.247 --> 21:25.082
any contact with them.
- My guess is

21:25.084 --> 21:27.885
that He destroyed them before
coming to the New World.

21:27.887 --> 21:31.822
And now he's come
here to finish the job.

21:31.824 --> 21:35.459
Setrakian may be a thief,
but he's a fighter.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.496
Which is more than can
be said for the lot of you.

21:38.498 --> 21:42.033
- We want to know what
you've learned from the<i> Lumen.</i>

21:43.970 --> 21:46.137
- Of course you do.

21:46.139 --> 21:50.341
You want to know if our search
for the Master's demise

21:50.343 --> 21:53.978
might also bring about
your demise as well.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.850
The book is not yet deciphered.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.019
We still have much work to do.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.356
- You will share with us
what you have found!

22:05.358 --> 22:08.125
- You would be wise not to
threaten me, your only ally

22:08.127 --> 22:10.795
in this war. I am
not your servant!

22:10.797 --> 22:15.433
I am your best hope.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.835
Fortunately for you,

22:17.837 --> 22:22.039
your enemy and mine is the same.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.721
(distant car alarm)
(men shouting)

22:42.028 --> 22:44.028
(woman groaning)

22:44.030 --> 22:47.865
- Can I help you get--
- Back off, big fella.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.035
Back off!
- I see you got it, huh?

22:51.037 --> 22:53.637
You have a great day!

22:55.308 --> 22:58.976
That's my kinda lady.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.782
(ping)

23:09.055 --> 23:11.589
Hey, sunshine.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.891
Miss me?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.060
- You were gone?

23:16.062 --> 23:18.396
- Only for four days.
Guess you didn't notice.

23:18.398 --> 23:22.500
So, how soon can
we end this thing

23:22.502 --> 23:25.035
and go back to ordering
takeout and yelling at the TV

23:25.037 --> 23:29.940
like normal New Yorkers, huh?
- In time, Mr. Fet. In time.

23:29.942 --> 23:33.010
- You've had that
thing for a week now.

23:33.012 --> 23:36.614
- This book has been compiled

23:36.616 --> 23:38.616
over the course of centuries.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.786
One week's reading
is not enough to unveil

23:41.788 --> 23:43.921
all its mysteries.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.891
- What's that? Oh,
what have I been up to?

23:46.893 --> 23:49.427
Oh, thanks for asking,
professor. I got assigned

23:49.429 --> 23:52.096
by Justine Faraldo to work
with these Navy SEALs --

23:52.098 --> 23:54.732
the government! They're
investigating a theory

23:54.734 --> 23:57.101
that there might be a King Rat
muncher that started

23:57.103 --> 23:59.737
the whole outbreak
on the plane, huh?

23:59.739 --> 24:02.072
So they're sending these
SEALS in to see if it's true

24:02.074 --> 24:04.074
and I'm supposed
to help them find him.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.444
They're finally coming
around to the reality

24:06.446 --> 24:08.913
of what's really going down.
- Well, it's as sound

24:08.915 --> 24:11.816
a plan as any.
- Yeah, right?

24:11.818 --> 24:15.953
Me steering these Navy SEALs
towards<i> strigoi</i> hot spots --

24:15.955 --> 24:18.722
you know, wherever
they're massing. Professor,

24:18.724 --> 24:22.059
these SEALs, they go in and they
slay 'em with extreme prejudice,

24:22.061 --> 24:25.729
you know? I mean, that's gotta
be good, right? - Why not?

24:28.134 --> 24:30.334
- There's the rousing vote of
confidence I was looking for.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.436
Thank you, Professor.

24:32.438 --> 24:36.474
Word to the wise:

24:36.476 --> 24:38.476
don't ever sneak up
in my blind spot

24:38.478 --> 24:41.245
unless you wanna
eat a rebar sandwich.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.948
- Your centurions --

24:43.950 --> 24:46.116
if they do find him,
you must alert me first

24:46.118 --> 24:50.020
before they pursue him.
I can finish him; they cannot.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.623
- Lemme tell you something,
Born-o, alright? First off,

24:52.625 --> 24:54.992
in our world, listening in
on people's conversations?

24:54.994 --> 24:58.529
Not polite. Second, these
centurions you're talking about?

24:58.531 --> 25:00.764
They're, like,
the best of the best.

25:00.766 --> 25:04.535
- Every failed empire has
a legion of elite warriors.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.638
- None with ISR drone support, night-vision
goggles and automatic assault rifles.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.708
- Technology offers no
advantage over the Master.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.710
- What these guys do, they do
better than anybody else

25:12.712 --> 25:16.881
in the history of the world.
Including half-vampires.

25:16.883 --> 25:20.684
10 bucks says we get
to him before you

25:20.686 --> 25:23.354
or the magic book do.
- Why would you bet against me

25:23.356 --> 25:27.691
if we're on the same side?
- Because I don't like you.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.894
Because you've got a stinger
like a full-on<i> strigoi,</i>

25:29.896 --> 25:31.862
and you drink human blood.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.398
Now if that makes me a racist,

25:34.400 --> 25:37.167
or a creature-ist,
or an anti-strigoic,

25:37.169 --> 25:40.070
well, then, there you go.
Fet's a hater.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.607
- Mr. Fet, that's enough.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.546
- Would you give me and the
Professor a moment alone

25:48.548 --> 25:52.149
to have a conversation?
Humans only.

25:57.557 --> 26:01.091
- Happy hunting.
- Yeah. You too, slick.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.666
How can you trust that guy?

26:08.668 --> 26:11.702
- Mr. Quinlan has
been instrumental

26:11.704 --> 26:14.371
in translating these pages.

26:14.373 --> 26:17.207
- What happens when he gets
everything that he needs

26:17.209 --> 26:19.043
from this book? You're
splitting rent and utilities

26:19.045 --> 26:22.279
with a muncher on steroids!
What happens if you wake up

26:22.281 --> 26:24.181
one morning with his
stinger in your neck?

26:24.183 --> 26:26.884
- If I do, your "I told you so"

26:26.886 --> 26:28.852
will be a source
of great comfort

26:28.854 --> 26:31.288
before you dispatch me.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.624
- Don't be so sentimental.

26:40.032 --> 26:44.535
You go ahead and do your thing.

26:46.706 --> 26:49.840
I'm gonna head back out,
hunt for the Master.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.478
- Mr. Fet.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.984
Good luck.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.887
- If I see him,

27:03.889 --> 27:05.990
I'll tell him you said hello.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.605
(indistinct voices)

27:21.607 --> 27:23.741
City Hall Station.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.776
Opened in 1904.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.779
One of the crown jewels
of the New York subway system.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.448
- You really love
this city, huh?

27:31.450 --> 27:34.351
- It's my home.
And it's under attack.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.854
- Understood.

27:36.856 --> 27:39.823
- Tell me the truth. Is there...

27:39.825 --> 27:43.260
Is there any version of this
where we might get more troops?

27:43.262 --> 27:45.529
- More troops?
Not a chance in hell.

27:45.531 --> 27:47.865
Truth is, we've got
two more days here.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.800
If we don't find
your King Rat, we're gone.

27:49.802 --> 27:53.937
On the big map,
New York's been written off.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.607
Sorry.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.276
(clicking)

27:59.278 --> 28:01.345
- Not sure "sorry" covers it.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.884
- Ford.
- Yes, sir.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.886
- You're heading up Team Two.
Get with your guys.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.988
- Roger that.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.490
- Fet, what do you got?

28:13.492 --> 28:16.160
-<i> Strigoi</i> returning
to nest at dawn.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.696
Hundreds of them
are going underground

28:18.698 --> 28:20.698
right below where
we're standing right now.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.701
- And where there's lots of strigoi...
- That's where we have our best

28:23.703 --> 28:26.670
shot at finding Bolivar. Hey,

28:26.672 --> 28:29.006
I've been thinking...

28:29.008 --> 28:31.842
I've been down there, so why
don't I gear up with you guys

28:31.844 --> 28:33.844
and I could lead you
to the muncher nest myself?

28:33.846 --> 28:36.847
- No civilian ride-alongs,
my friend.

28:36.849 --> 28:39.817
Enjoy the show.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.819
- Here we go.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.288
- See ya, Fet.
- I got your back, buddy.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.828
- Alright, eyes everywhere.
These things can move.

28:50.830 --> 28:54.164
Patience, patience, patience.
- Got your rear.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.934
(growling)

28:56.936 --> 28:59.703
- Sentinel munchers.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.906
They're like lookouts. [Just get
as close as you can to them]

29:02.908 --> 29:05.342
[without alerting them
to your presence.]

29:08.581 --> 29:11.081
- Coming up on our six!
Prepare to engage.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.019
- Stay sharp.

29:16.021 --> 29:18.422
- More movement.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.924
(gunshots)
(buzzing)

29:20.926 --> 29:23.961
Hold fire!

29:23.963 --> 29:26.897
Fet. I can see
a person down here

29:26.899 --> 29:29.967
[in a suit. A human person.]
- Hold on.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.703
- [You see what I'm seeing?]

29:32.705 --> 29:36.106
[Fet, come in!]

29:36.108 --> 29:38.709
- What?
- [Fet!]

29:38.711 --> 29:41.044
- Get on him! Don't lose him!
- [What the hell]

29:41.046 --> 29:43.046
[are you talking about?]
- That's Bolivar's number two!

29:43.048 --> 29:46.250
- Move! Going up!
- [Kroft! Be careful!]

29:46.252 --> 29:48.051
[I'm warning you!] He's fast.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.487
- Not faster than a bullet.

29:50.489 --> 29:54.358
- Actually, I think he is.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.465
(fire roaring)
(indistinct voices)

30:01.467 --> 30:03.467
- Team Two, keep your
distance. Let's see

30:03.469 --> 30:05.269
where this guy's going.
- [Copy that.]

30:05.271 --> 30:08.005
[He's heading to the church.]

30:08.007 --> 30:11.575
- Wait for me!

30:11.577 --> 30:13.811
- We're at the church.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.647
- Alright, boys. Stack it up.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.584
Let's go, let's go.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.020
On me. Ready?

30:23.022 --> 30:25.823
Go, go, go!

30:25.825 --> 30:28.325
- Go, go, go!
- Cover, move, cover, move.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.194
- Watch your step, boys.

30:39.772 --> 30:42.372
(whispering): Watch your backs.
- Clear.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.441
- Got the rear?

30:46.378 --> 30:48.946
Moving.
- Go!

30:55.788 --> 30:58.055
- No! Don't go down there yet.

30:58.057 --> 31:01.458
Kroft? C'mon!
Somebody answer me!

31:01.460 --> 31:03.460
- Cut the pie, guys.

31:03.462 --> 31:06.129
Check the corners.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.803
(whooshing)
What was that?

31:12.805 --> 31:14.972
- What the hell was that?

31:17.643 --> 31:20.177
Team leader, over.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.246
Kroft, come in.

31:22.248 --> 31:25.015
(buzzing)

31:25.017 --> 31:27.284
Oh, shit.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.890
It looks like a good
time to fall back.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.894
(high-pitched ringing)
(moaning)

31:41.267 --> 31:43.767
(moaning through radio)

31:43.769 --> 31:46.503
- Ford? Ford!

31:46.505 --> 31:49.306
(high-pitched ringing)
(moaning)

31:51.877 --> 31:56.246
- Something's happening to
the feeds. Ford? You read me?

31:56.248 --> 31:58.248
(moaning)

31:58.250 --> 32:00.951
Kroft!
- Talk to me.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.953
[Anybody.]

32:02.955 --> 32:06.356
- You're not hunting him
anymore. He's hunting you.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.159
- Let's go.
- Go, go.

32:14.199 --> 32:17.134
- Move, move, move!
- It's open.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.074
- Move in. Nothing.
- Ford?

32:24.076 --> 32:26.944
- [I've lost visual.]
- Me, too.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.379
Scaggs? Vannelli?
- Nothing.

32:29.381 --> 32:33.016
- Dark.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.821
- Get it?
- I dunno.

32:37.823 --> 32:40.424
- Playing with us.
(screaming on radio)

32:40.426 --> 32:43.961
- Scaggs?

33:27.773 --> 33:29.606

33:29.608 --> 33:32.376

33:38.851 --> 33:41.518
- VANNELLI?

33:41.520 --> 33:44.321

33:44.323 --> 33:47.657

33:47.659 --> 33:50.394

33:50.396 --> 33:54.398
- FET? GET OUT OF HERE!
(high-pitched ringing)

33:54.400 --> 33:57.234
(moaning)
- Vannelli?

33:57.236 --> 33:59.302
(groaning)

34:01.974 --> 34:04.307
- Coley? Coley, what is it?

34:04.309 --> 34:06.276
(high-pitched ringing continues)

34:13.152 --> 34:15.719
Where the hell are you?!

34:15.721 --> 34:18.155
(man yelling)

34:28.100 --> 34:30.834
(panting)

34:30.836 --> 34:33.870
Damn it. Fet!

34:33.872 --> 34:36.373

34:36.375 --> 34:39.209
(high-pitched ringing)

34:39.211 --> 34:41.278

34:44.216 --> 34:47.951

35:24.823 --> 35:27.824

35:32.231 --> 35:34.331
(low humming sound)

35:37.102 --> 35:40.470
(heavy breathing)

35:43.175 --> 35:46.109
(shrieking)

35:46.111 --> 35:48.044
(gunfire)
(yelling)

35:57.823 --> 36:00.023
(grunting)

36:03.929 --> 36:06.229
(heavy breathing)

36:09.368 --> 36:12.035
- Lovely evening!

36:12.037 --> 36:14.371
Is it not?

36:14.373 --> 36:16.606
- Goddamn you.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.144
- Mom?

37:16.201 --> 37:18.668
- Will you help me?

37:53.639 --> 37:56.640
The Master is going
to let us be together.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.012
- Why?

38:03.448 --> 38:06.216
- Because I am going
to do something for him.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.831
- (distant man):
Get out of my way!

38:21.833 --> 38:24.768
(switch flipping)

38:24.770 --> 38:26.803
(distant explosion)

38:28.674 --> 38:30.940
(dog barking)

38:30.942 --> 38:33.977
(indistinct shouting outside)

38:35.781 --> 38:37.781
(helicopter whirring)

38:37.783 --> 38:40.083
♪♪♪

39:02.808 --> 39:04.874
(distant siren blaring)

39:18.724 --> 39:20.857
(distant siren blaring)
(distant honking)

39:26.398 --> 39:28.631
(dog barking)

39:32.671 --> 39:34.738
- Ah.

39:38.143 --> 39:40.543
About, above...

39:40.545 --> 39:42.512
across, after,

39:42.514 --> 39:45.882
among, against...

39:45.884 --> 39:47.884
around...
(ruckus outside)

39:47.886 --> 39:50.019
(dog barking)

39:50.021 --> 39:52.856
Around,

39:52.858 --> 39:57.026
at...
(door creaking open)

39:57.028 --> 39:59.062
(dog barking)

40:00.999 --> 40:03.600
(door creaking)

40:03.602 --> 40:06.369
(door squeaking)
Zack?

40:06.371 --> 40:08.438
(creatures growling)

40:11.410 --> 40:13.443
(creatures clicking
and growling)

40:38.036 --> 40:41.037
Where is Zack?
- Zack is alive.

40:41.039 --> 40:44.307
You can get him back.
- Where is he?

40:44.309 --> 40:47.544
- He's safe.
- Where is my son?

40:57.656 --> 41:00.824
How much of you
is still alive in there?

41:00.826 --> 41:03.059
- Enough.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.562
When His voice
leaves me,

41:05.564 --> 41:07.564
when His leash loosens,

41:07.566 --> 41:10.767
I still feel sadness...

41:10.769 --> 41:14.170
like a void.

41:14.172 --> 41:17.140
Then the thirst drives
those emotions away.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.108
(creatures growling)

41:19.110 --> 41:21.077
But I am still here.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.217
(creatures growling)

41:29.254 --> 41:32.155
We want the Lumen.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.357
- The book?!

41:35.961 --> 41:38.761
You kept Zack alive
to trade him

41:38.763 --> 41:41.531
for a book?

41:44.703 --> 41:47.971
- You have a choice
to make.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.840
The<i> Lumen...</i>

41:50.842 --> 41:53.343
or Zack.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.787
(theme music)
