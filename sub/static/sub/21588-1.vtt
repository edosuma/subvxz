[music - shire, "us"]

00:44.034 --> 00:51.241
[SINGING] Dreams do, they do
come true, manifested in you.

00:51.275 --> 00:54.034
You're my fate.

00:54.068 --> 01:00.379
This union we built is
much stronger than any bond

01:00.413 --> 01:04.137
that I've ever made.

01:04.172 --> 01:11.310
My half, my heart, can't nothingreplace you, my number one.

01:11.344 --> 01:14.137
You're my number one, love.

01:14.172 --> 01:16.620
You're my number one.

01:16.655 --> 01:21.586
I pray every night
for my family.

01:21.620 --> 01:25.689
I give all my love, my soul.

01:25.724 --> 01:27.793
All we have is us.

01:31.344 --> 01:33.241
All we have is us.

01:39.896 --> 01:49.379
My perfection, I'm honored to
be in your corner each day.

01:49.413 --> 01:52.241
There's no greater love.

01:52.275 --> 01:54.793
Can't nothing destroy us.

01:54.827 --> 02:00.310
We drown out the
noise from the pain.

02:00.344 --> 02:01.965
My number one.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.310
I pray every night
for my family.

02:07.344 --> 02:11.586
I give all my love, my soul.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.655
All we have is us.

02:16.551 --> 02:18.620
All we have is us.

02:22.827 --> 02:25.724
How could I ever leave?

02:25.758 --> 02:33.172
How could I ever
mistreat you in that way?

02:33.206 --> 02:36.586
There's no way I'm
letting up, no way

02:36.620 --> 02:42.586
I'm giving up on what we had.

02:42.620 --> 02:47.482
I pray every night
for my family.

02:47.517 --> 02:51.793
I give all my love, my soul.

02:51.827 --> 02:54.379
All we have is us.

02:57.482 --> 02:59.379
All we have is us.

03:02.827 --> 03:07.793
I pray every night
for my family.

03:07.827 --> 03:12.413
I give all my love, my soul.

03:12.448 --> 03:14.379
All we have is us.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.344
All we have is us.

03:24.724 --> 03:26.379
It's 6:00, babe.

03:26.413 --> 03:27.310
Rise and shine.

03:41.275 --> 03:46.379
So the look is dated,
but this photographer is

03:46.413 --> 03:48.379
catching all her best angles.

03:48.413 --> 03:52.517
Babe, look at his lighting.

03:52.551 --> 03:55.275
Oh, yeah, babe, that's tight.

03:55.310 --> 03:56.482
Hey, can you get
me my belt for me?

04:01.103 --> 04:02.724
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

04:02.758 --> 04:04.000
He shot Laura last year.

04:04.034 --> 04:04.724
Mm.

04:04.758 --> 04:05.965
Necktie or no tie?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.310
No tie.

04:07.344 --> 04:08.310
Laura?

04:08.344 --> 04:11.448
Big booty, modelling
girl Laura, your friend?

04:11.482 --> 04:14.310
Yeah, she is super classy.

04:14.344 --> 04:15.310
Relax, babe.

04:15.344 --> 04:17.758
You know I've never
done that type of stuff.

04:17.793 --> 04:20.034
Strictly high fashion artistic.

04:20.068 --> 04:21.724
Mm-hmm.

04:21.758 --> 04:24.034
I'm thinking if I
can shoot with him,

04:24.068 --> 04:26.034
I can get some more
stuff for my portfolio.

04:26.068 --> 04:26.689
Yeah.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.000
And start modelling again.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.724
OK, all right,
well, listen, who

04:29.758 --> 04:32.724
is going to be taking
care of our little girl

04:32.758 --> 04:36.551
while you're out there
gallivanting the world?

04:36.586 --> 04:38.517
She can get a sitter.

04:38.551 --> 04:40.862
She's old enough now.

04:40.896 --> 04:44.586
Come on, guy, what, you
don't think I got it anymore?

04:44.620 --> 04:45.862
What?

04:45.896 --> 04:46.931
Come here, you.

04:49.758 --> 04:53.413
Sasha Curtis, you
are the finest,

04:53.448 --> 04:56.655
baddest woman I've
ever met in my life.

04:56.689 --> 04:58.482
But you're not 19 no more, baby.

04:58.517 --> 04:59.862
I'm not 19 anymore, OK?

04:59.896 --> 05:02.724
Taking care of our baby
should be our top priority,

05:02.758 --> 05:05.724
not chasing old hobbies, right?

05:05.758 --> 05:06.724
Yes?

05:06.758 --> 05:07.655
Yes?

05:07.689 --> 05:08.448
Yes.

05:14.172 --> 05:15.586
All right?

05:15.620 --> 05:16.827
I gotta roll.

05:16.862 --> 05:17.827
Can you throw on some
turkey bacon for me?

05:21.034 --> 05:23.793
GUY [VOICEOVER]: I think
I am a damn good husband.

05:23.827 --> 05:26.034
I bought Sasha the
house she always wanted.

05:26.068 --> 05:27.517
I've got a great job.

05:27.551 --> 05:30.034
And my daughter knows
that no man will ever

05:30.068 --> 05:32.758
love her more than her daddy.

05:32.793 --> 05:34.931
I don't like to pat
myself on the back,

05:34.965 --> 05:37.379
but I hope Sasha knows she's
got one of the good ones.

05:37.413 --> 05:39.896
SASHA [VOICEOVER]: My
family is everything.

05:39.931 --> 05:42.034
That's why breakfast is
on the table every morning

05:42.068 --> 05:43.931
and dinner is ready by 7:00.

05:43.965 --> 05:46.034
My husband just wants me to
focus on our home for now.

05:46.068 --> 05:48.379
And I'll pick back
up the career later.

05:48.413 --> 05:49.103
Come on, babe.

05:49.137 --> 05:50.275
Breakfast is up.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.862
SASHA [VOICEOVER]: You sacrificefor the people you love.

05:51.896 --> 05:53.482
Sweetie, what
you need to do is

05:53.517 --> 05:54.965
concentrating on eating insteadof trying to find the toy.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.034
The only reason why I
eat cereal is for the toy.

05:58.068 --> 05:59.896
Either eat or track
down that toy, Skyla,

05:59.931 --> 06:02.655
but do it quick or
you two will be late.

06:02.689 --> 06:05.103
Oh, thank you, baby.

06:05.137 --> 06:07.793
I am so tired of eating
that downtown food.

06:07.827 --> 06:10.724
Yep, I need you to
maintain that frame.

06:10.758 --> 06:13.068
You know your metabolism
slows when you get older.

06:13.103 --> 06:16.896
So I've been
getting a little gut.

06:16.931 --> 06:18.586
You don't think I deserve it?

06:18.620 --> 06:19.896
Not till you're 50.

06:19.931 --> 06:21.068
It's sexy, baby.

06:21.103 --> 06:23.068
Uh, no.

06:23.103 --> 06:25.482
Seriously, no more
food truck lunches.

06:25.517 --> 06:31.448
All right, on one condition,
you stop being so forgetful.

06:31.482 --> 06:32.379
Oh.

06:32.413 --> 06:36.724
Oh, yes, bags, keys,
the bills, Sasha.

06:36.758 --> 06:39.586
Stop exaggerating.

06:39.620 --> 06:40.448
Maybe the keys.

06:40.482 --> 06:41.137
GUY: Mm-hmm.

06:41.172 --> 06:43.862
But you, lay out that junk.

06:43.896 --> 06:45.551
You got it.

06:45.586 --> 06:51.000
What I should do is take one ofthose fitness classes like you.

06:51.034 --> 06:53.620
That reminds me, I have
my class today at 10:00.

06:53.655 --> 06:56.793
By the way, speaking
of those fitness classes,

06:56.827 --> 07:00.620
I am loving the results.

07:03.586 --> 07:04.241
Hey, you.

07:04.275 --> 07:05.068
Hmm?

07:08.827 --> 07:10.793
Skyla, grab your
stuff, sweetie.

07:10.827 --> 07:13.275
We're gonna be late.

07:13.310 --> 07:17.172
So you might want to think aboutgetting Skyla after daycare.

07:17.206 --> 07:23.206
Because it looks like I'm
gonna be after 7:00 tonight.

07:23.241 --> 07:23.931
Again?

07:23.965 --> 07:25.517
Mm-hmm.

07:25.551 --> 07:27.172
Babe, you're going to have
to tell your boss I need

07:27.206 --> 07:28.655
you home at a reasonable hour.

07:28.689 --> 07:30.137
Promotion is coming.

07:30.172 --> 07:31.034
So this won't be long.

07:31.068 --> 07:31.931
Skyla, get your stuff.

07:31.965 --> 07:33.689
Babe.

07:33.724 --> 07:35.896
I love you and I
love this house.

07:35.931 --> 07:37.000
But the house can't
talk back to me.

07:37.034 --> 07:38.068
And I feel the love.

07:38.103 --> 07:40.137
I'm serious now.

07:40.172 --> 07:42.034
Come on, I need you
home more often.

07:42.068 --> 07:43.931
It's not a request.

07:43.965 --> 07:45.965
It's not a request.

07:46.000 --> 07:46.931
I get it.

07:46.965 --> 07:47.793
Skyla, kiss your mom.

07:47.827 --> 07:50.517
Let's roll.

07:50.551 --> 07:51.517
Bye, babe.

07:51.551 --> 07:52.655
- Bye, mom.- Come on, we're gonna be late.

07:52.689 --> 07:53.793
Be good.

07:53.827 --> 07:54.620
Coming, dad.

08:08.620 --> 08:09.862
Hey, babe.

08:09.896 --> 08:10.965
Guy, can you come back.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.034
I have a flat tire.

08:12.068 --> 08:13.206
GUY [ON PHONE]: Oh, a flat?

08:13.241 --> 08:15.137
Oh, babe, I can't be late today.

08:15.172 --> 08:18.000
The tyrant's in the office.

08:18.034 --> 08:19.241
Why don't you grab a Cruise?

08:19.275 --> 08:20.724
SASHA [ON PHONE]: A Cruise?

08:20.758 --> 08:23.655
Yeah, it's a lot like
Uber, the ride share.

08:23.689 --> 08:27.103
Kevin does it all the time
when he's too drunk to drive.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.344
No, I just--

08:28.379 --> 08:31.862
I don't feel comfortable being
in a car with a stranger.

08:31.896 --> 08:33.275
You think it's safe?

08:33.310 --> 08:34.965
Well, I'm sure if it wasn't,
it wouldn't be so popular,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.137
baby.

08:36.172 --> 08:37.827
I know who'll listen
next time I show 'em

08:37.862 --> 08:40.586
how to change a
flat tire, though.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.689
Ha-ha.

08:41.724 --> 08:44.000
You just make sure you
fix it when you get back.

08:44.034 --> 08:45.241
All right, baby.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.241
Bye.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.034
Bye.

08:55.862 --> 08:56.689
Mr. Curtis?

08:56.724 --> 08:57.862
Yes, ma'am.

08:57.896 --> 09:01.862
I'm still waiting for your
report on Kendrick Grant.

09:01.896 --> 09:02.965
Ms. Steele is asking for it.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.103
That's right.

09:04.137 --> 09:05.034
And I'm waiting on
something myself.

09:05.068 --> 09:05.931
What?

09:05.965 --> 09:07.000
A smile.

09:07.034 --> 09:08.172
Hello.
- Right.

09:08.206 --> 09:09.310
Hey, I just violated the man.

09:09.344 --> 09:10.172
Can you tell her
I'll get it to her?

09:10.206 --> 09:11.034
You got it.

09:11.068 --> 09:12.137
We talked about it.

09:12.172 --> 09:13.793
Look, buddy, what did I say?

09:13.827 --> 09:15.034
Your piss is weekly now.

09:15.068 --> 09:16.000
No heads up.

09:16.034 --> 09:17.034
What the hell, Fraser?

09:17.068 --> 09:18.310
Why are you riding me so hard?

09:18.344 --> 09:21.310
It's called
parole, you're on it.

09:21.344 --> 09:23.862
Keep your piss clean and
there won't be any problems.

09:23.896 --> 09:24.758
But I--

09:24.793 --> 09:26.689
Rif, less words.

09:30.172 --> 09:33.241
Schedule Vincent Rifkin
for a piss test, please.

09:33.275 --> 09:34.103
Yeah, I'm on it.

09:34.137 --> 09:35.000
Thank you.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.034
Rif, less words.

09:36.068 --> 09:37.172
That's a boss.
That is a boss.

09:37.206 --> 09:38.655
Thank you.

09:38.689 --> 09:39.931
It's a good idea to
keep him on a short leash.

09:39.965 --> 09:41.310
Yeah, I wish
I'd kept my lying,

09:41.344 --> 09:43.689
cheating ex on a short leash.

09:43.724 --> 09:46.689
Oh, by the way, boss lady is
on the floor and she's pissed,

09:46.724 --> 09:47.724
so beware.

09:47.758 --> 09:49.275
Awesome, I've not have
my balls crushed lately.

09:49.310 --> 09:50.655
Always a great time.

09:55.206 --> 09:59.655
Mr. Smith, what the hell
are you doing in my office?

09:59.689 --> 10:03.034
Don't talk, just
don't say anything.

10:03.068 --> 10:04.655
What can I do for you, sir?

10:04.689 --> 10:07.206
Listen, I appreciate
you, Mr. Curtis.

10:07.241 --> 10:09.241
I'm just not cut out
for manual labor.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.793
Mr. Smith, are you holding
a framed picture of my wife?

10:17.448 --> 10:20.896
Now, I found a new
job as a male model.

10:20.931 --> 10:22.103
It pays under the table.

10:22.137 --> 10:23.689
But I just want to
let you know that I'm

10:23.724 --> 10:27.689
100% compliant on my
employee requirements.

10:27.724 --> 10:29.172
That's good.

10:29.206 --> 10:32.172
I want you to understand
something, Mr. Smith.

10:32.206 --> 10:36.724
Male model or not, if
there is no paper trail,

10:36.758 --> 10:38.655
there is no job as
far as I'm concerned.

10:38.689 --> 10:39.758
Do you understand?

10:39.793 --> 10:40.931
Do you understand the
way these things connect?

10:40.965 --> 10:42.103
Come on, Mr. Curtis.

10:42.137 --> 10:43.310
I mean, cut me a break.
- Cut you a break?

10:43.344 --> 10:44.793
Why would I cut you a break?
- I can't--

10:44.827 --> 10:46.137
You're holding a framed
picture of my wife.

10:46.172 --> 10:48.172
I cannot lift another
pound of concrete.

10:48.206 --> 10:49.310
I'd rather go back to jail.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.068
Now, you go on to something.

10:51.103 --> 10:53.172
You of all people
should understand how

10:53.206 --> 10:56.344
easily that can be arranged.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.310
Tamika, please get in here.

11:01.379 --> 11:03.310
If I touch that picture
again and it's sticky,

11:03.344 --> 11:04.931
me and you are gonna
have some problems.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.862
Tamika, get in here.

11:07.896 --> 11:09.137
Yes, Mr. Curtis.

11:09.172 --> 11:11.862
Will you please escort
Mr. Smith back to his car.

11:11.896 --> 11:14.275
Mr. Smith, you're dismissed.

11:14.310 --> 11:15.206
Good morning, Ms. Steele.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.172
Good morning.

11:19.172 --> 11:20.379
Good morning, Mr. Curtis.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.379
Morning.

11:21.413 --> 11:23.310
I hope there's some
life-threatening excuse

11:23.344 --> 11:25.206
to explain why you're late.

11:25.241 --> 11:28.172
Linda, I'm not
scheduled until 9:30.

11:28.206 --> 11:29.862
OK, I have a reason for this.

11:29.896 --> 11:33.413
If I wanted excuses, I
would have hired my ex.

11:33.448 --> 11:36.862
You, on the other hand, are
vying to be my replacement.

11:39.275 --> 11:41.172
Get your shit
together, Mr. Curtis.

11:43.793 --> 11:44.862
Yes, ma'am.

11:44.896 --> 11:46.758
[QUIETLY] I swear to God.

11:50.137 --> 11:51.827
[knocking]

11:51.862 --> 11:53.448
Yes, Linda?

11:53.482 --> 11:56.344
Oh, someone's a little jumpy.

11:56.379 --> 11:59.034
You OK?

11:59.068 --> 12:00.827
I'm fine, thank you.

12:00.862 --> 12:03.310
Hey, look, I know I'm new,
but I've dealt with a million

12:03.344 --> 12:04.310
bosses like her before.

12:04.344 --> 12:06.034
Don't let her get you twisted.

12:06.068 --> 12:07.034
No, Linda's not a problem.

12:07.068 --> 12:08.931
I can handle her.

12:08.965 --> 12:13.379
I was thinking, how would
you like Japanese for lunch?

12:13.413 --> 12:17.310
Well, you know
something, Elaine, Linda's

12:17.344 --> 12:18.931
probably planning
her next vacation

12:18.965 --> 12:21.034
right now, so probably not.

12:21.068 --> 12:24.310
Well, I was thinking we
could have it delivered here

12:24.344 --> 12:26.517
and eat together.

12:29.896 --> 12:33.172
Elaine, I'm a
married man, framed

12:33.206 --> 12:37.206
pictures of family and all, andprobably not such a good look.

12:37.241 --> 12:38.068
I know.

12:38.103 --> 12:40.379
Right.

12:40.413 --> 12:41.931
Crossing the line.

12:41.965 --> 12:42.896
It happens.

12:42.931 --> 12:43.896
So sorry.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.172
Sometimes I can be a
little over friendly.

12:47.206 --> 12:48.448
Nothing's wrong
with that, Elaine.

12:48.482 --> 12:50.000
Though you should
probably read the handbook

12:50.034 --> 12:52.241
on appropriate office attire.

12:52.275 --> 12:54.551
Friendly is a good thing, right?

12:54.586 --> 12:55.965
So friends.

12:56.000 --> 12:56.793
Yeah.

12:59.896 --> 13:04.517
Eric, I need you
to get me two copies.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.310
I need to get the Wilson file.

13:06.344 --> 13:09.034
Oh, yes.

13:09.068 --> 13:12.586
Oh, are we dressed
for work or a slut walk?

13:12.620 --> 13:13.413
Nice color.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.241
Thank you for being
on time so I don't

13:19.275 --> 13:24.206
have to violate your parole andsend your ass back to prison.

13:24.241 --> 13:27.482
OK, let's get some
things straight.

13:27.517 --> 13:30.379
Condition number
one of your parole--

13:30.413 --> 13:32.275
you must report here weekly.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.413
Condition number
two of your parole--

13:34.448 --> 13:37.448
you must acquire
gainful employment.

13:37.482 --> 13:39.586
Condition number
three of your parole--

13:39.620 --> 13:42.517
you must submit to
random drug testing.

13:42.551 --> 13:46.482
Condition number four-- you areabsolutely not allowed to leave

13:46.517 --> 13:50.379
the state as a condition of--

13:50.413 --> 13:53.862
as a condition of--

13:53.896 --> 13:55.344
My parole.

13:55.379 --> 13:57.034
Exactly.

13:57.068 --> 13:59.068
I'm glad we've got that clear.

13:59.103 --> 14:06.448
So I see that you are a
graduate of Howard University.

14:10.344 --> 14:11.965
Impressive.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.448
Then you should have absolutelyno problem finding a job.

14:16.482 --> 14:20.034
The Mecca is still producing
credible contributors

14:20.068 --> 14:20.620
to society.

14:30.482 --> 14:34.172
Ms. Wilson, I'm going
to be frank with you.

14:34.206 --> 14:38.172
There are some details about
your case that bother me.

14:38.206 --> 14:41.413
See, princess, I don't know
if you are being sincere

14:41.448 --> 14:42.482
or if you just
think you're going

14:42.517 --> 14:44.931
to slide through the system.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.310
In either case, I've
got a full workload,

14:47.344 --> 14:52.000
so I will be assigning you to
my senior officer Mr. Curtis.

14:52.034 --> 14:56.034
Mr. Curtis will be giving
me a full, detailed report

14:56.068 --> 14:58.137
on your progress.

14:58.172 --> 15:01.137
You got that?

15:01.172 --> 15:04.413
Understood.

15:04.448 --> 15:05.413
Good.

15:19.206 --> 15:22.724
[knocking]

15:22.758 --> 15:24.586
Hi, Mr. Curtis.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.103
Your new parolee, Faren Wilson.

15:30.068 --> 15:32.068
SASHA [ON PHONE]: No,
he's not coming to get me.

15:32.103 --> 15:33.379
Girl!

15:33.413 --> 15:34.655
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Yeah.

15:34.689 --> 15:36.172
What you mean he's not
coming back to get you?

15:36.206 --> 15:37.517
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Oh, he's
already late for work.

15:37.551 --> 15:40.172
Oh, so raggedy.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.241
I'm about to come get you.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.275
SASHA [ON PHONE]: No.

15:42.310 --> 15:44.034
Just save your gas.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.137
What you mean?

15:45.172 --> 15:46.379
You thought I wasn't gonna
get $20 up off of you?

15:46.413 --> 15:47.724
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Uh, whatever.

15:47.758 --> 15:48.620
I call a Cruise.

15:48.655 --> 15:51.482
Girl, all I'm
saying is be careful.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.103
Statistics say
that Uber drivers--

15:53.137 --> 15:54.034
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Cruise.

15:54.068 --> 15:55.068
I mean, Cruise--

15:55.103 --> 15:58.137
bootleg-ass Uber-- they
are more likely to be

15:58.172 --> 15:59.689
sex offenders or rapists in LA.

15:59.724 --> 16:00.793
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Would you--

16:00.827 --> 16:02.068
I blogged about it last week.

16:02.103 --> 16:02.827
SASHA [ON PHONE]:
Are you serious?

16:02.862 --> 16:03.655
[laughs]

16:05.793 --> 16:06.586
Bye.

16:06.620 --> 16:07.724
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Bye.

16:07.758 --> 16:13.172
[MUSIC - SHIRE, "NEVER LOOK
BACK"]

16:20.206 --> 16:21.172
Hey.

16:21.206 --> 16:22.689
Sasha Curtis?

16:22.724 --> 16:24.137
Yeah

16:24.172 --> 16:24.862
Welcome to Cruise.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.034
It's like Uber, but, you know--

16:27.068 --> 16:29.172
I'll take that.

16:29.206 --> 16:32.241
Um, mister?

16:32.275 --> 16:33.413
Lance.

16:33.448 --> 16:34.482
Lance, I could
have kept it with me.

16:34.517 --> 16:37.241
It's not that big, the bag.

16:37.275 --> 16:38.172
Oh.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.344
Yeah, you could.

16:39.379 --> 16:41.517
I'm sorry.

16:41.551 --> 16:43.517
No, no, it's fine.

16:43.551 --> 16:46.793
I was just saying.

16:46.827 --> 16:48.310
All right, you're all set?

16:48.344 --> 16:49.172
Yeah.

16:49.206 --> 16:50.068
OK, cool.

16:50.103 --> 16:51.379
Enjoy your Cruise.

16:51.413 --> 16:53.275
[SINGING] No worries
and no limits.

16:53.310 --> 16:56.482
I'll make sure we stay
winning with all my heart.

16:56.517 --> 17:00.103
So Sasha, first
time using Cruise?

17:00.137 --> 17:01.137
It is.

17:01.172 --> 17:02.241
How could you tell?

17:02.275 --> 17:04.241
Oh, I work this area a lot.

17:04.275 --> 17:06.517
Real flexible gig.

17:06.551 --> 17:08.655
Gig, huh?

17:08.689 --> 17:13.517
Let me guess, you're an actor.

17:13.551 --> 17:15.172
How could you tell?

17:15.206 --> 17:19.103
Well, anybody calling a job
a gig is only passing through.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.482
Plus, you don't sound
like you're from LA.

17:22.517 --> 17:25.344
Likely trying to break
into entertainment.

17:25.379 --> 17:27.551
Pretty observant.

17:27.586 --> 17:29.827
You're a model, aren't you?

17:29.862 --> 17:30.517
No.

17:30.551 --> 17:33.620
No, I'm a wife and a mother.

17:33.655 --> 17:37.206
And I design jewelry.

17:37.241 --> 17:37.827
That's my gig.

17:41.517 --> 17:43.896
Well, I hope I'm
not out of line.

17:43.931 --> 17:46.586
You're a very beautiful woman.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.620
My husband thought
so too, so he made

17:48.655 --> 17:51.241
a point to wife me up quick.

17:51.275 --> 17:54.517
But I'll let you in
on a little secret.

17:54.551 --> 17:55.896
I used to model.

17:55.931 --> 17:58.241
But then I got married
and had my daughter,

17:58.275 --> 18:00.862
so I had to shift my priorities.

18:04.586 --> 18:07.310
The world missed
out on you, Sasha.

18:07.344 --> 18:08.862
[SINGING] Never look back.

18:08.896 --> 18:11.758
There's no mistaking this, yeah.

18:11.793 --> 18:13.689
This is the life
we livin', yeah.

18:13.724 --> 18:19.310
I'm gonna make sure
that we stay together.

18:19.344 --> 18:21.620
Just 'cause I love you.

18:21.655 --> 18:24.310
Do anything for you.

18:24.344 --> 18:25.586
You are my heart.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.206
You are my everything.

18:30.620 --> 18:33.586
Never look back.

18:33.620 --> 18:34.689
Thanks for the ride, Lance.

18:34.724 --> 18:36.172
Of course.

18:36.206 --> 18:39.965
And if you need something,
anything, you can--

18:40.000 --> 18:40.758
Cruise app.

18:50.000 --> 18:50.965
Ready?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.275
All right.

18:53.310 --> 18:58.241
[SINGING] Giving you the world,everything you never had.

18:58.275 --> 19:04.241
I'll make sure you're good
so you can't look back.

19:04.275 --> 19:06.724
I put in the work just
so we can make it last.

19:06.758 --> 19:10.758
It's very nice of
you to join us, Sasha.

19:10.793 --> 19:12.448
Let's get the stretch in.

19:12.482 --> 19:13.793
Hands on your knees.

19:16.620 --> 19:17.793
Who was that?

19:17.827 --> 19:19.724
This Cruise driver.

19:19.758 --> 19:21.241
Looking like that?

19:21.275 --> 19:22.275
Oh, shit.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.793
I need to park my car
and download that app.

19:24.827 --> 19:25.931
He drives a Cruise.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.827
I doubt he could afford you.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.551
Girl, please, I'd pay a
man to take me to dinner.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.931
That right there
is a happy hour.

19:40.655 --> 19:42.551
Damn, girl.

19:42.586 --> 19:46.448
Will you please thank whoever
is teaching that fitness class

19:46.482 --> 19:48.620
you're in for me personally?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.655
Oh, you like?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.655
I do.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.827
It's called camera ready.

19:55.517 --> 19:57.275
You still thinking
about that modeling stuff?

19:57.310 --> 19:59.000
You don't need them
to validate you.

19:59.034 --> 20:00.620
Just relax.

20:00.655 --> 20:01.965
I'm getting into shape for me.

20:04.827 --> 20:06.655
No other reason.

20:06.689 --> 20:07.931
Excuse me.

20:07.965 --> 20:09.896
Well, to me, you're
perfect, babe.

20:22.275 --> 20:23.551
Come on, you got it.
Let's go!

20:23.586 --> 20:24.413
Let's go!

20:24.448 --> 20:25.620
Finish it out!

20:25.655 --> 20:26.862
Finish out strong, let's go.

20:26.896 --> 20:28.827
Come on, come on, come on.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.448
Looking good, looking good.

20:30.482 --> 20:31.310
I like that.

20:31.344 --> 20:32.482
I like that.

20:32.517 --> 20:33.551
I like that.

20:33.586 --> 20:34.413
Two.

20:34.448 --> 20:36.034
One, one, two.

20:36.068 --> 20:36.965
Two.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.827
Spread your legs,
let's kneel into that.

20:39.862 --> 20:43.655
Close your eyes and
imagine you're the wind.

20:43.689 --> 20:44.931
All right, up.

20:44.965 --> 20:46.517
Looking strong.
Looking strong.

20:46.551 --> 20:47.379
Switch.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.241
That's right.

20:49.275 --> 20:51.655
See, what you want to do is
you want to get deep in there.

20:51.689 --> 20:53.034
You want to feel
that right there.

20:53.068 --> 20:54.034
You feel that?

20:54.068 --> 20:56.310
I can-- I can actually
go a little deeper,

20:56.344 --> 20:57.000
if you want me to go--

20:57.034 --> 20:59.758
Oh, yeah, see, the way you--

20:59.793 --> 21:01.862
the way you're doing that,
you feel that right there?

21:01.896 --> 21:02.965
Yeah, it's tight right there.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.344
It's tight right there right.

21:04.379 --> 21:05.034
Just squeeze it.

21:05.068 --> 21:05.620
Ah, yeah.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.793
Squeeze it right there.

21:14.068 --> 21:14.758
Lance, right?

21:14.793 --> 21:16.482
Yeah.

21:16.517 --> 21:17.413
What are you doing here?

21:17.448 --> 21:18.482
You have a pick up?

21:18.517 --> 21:19.620
Actually, I'm here for you.

21:19.655 --> 21:20.448
Excuse me?

21:25.620 --> 21:27.344
Oh, wow.

21:27.379 --> 21:28.068
Thank you.

21:28.103 --> 21:29.862
I didn't even realize I left it.

21:29.896 --> 21:31.000
I figured you'd be here.

21:31.034 --> 21:32.689
Well, that's very
thoughtful of you.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.344
Thank you.

21:34.379 --> 21:35.827
Uber?

21:35.862 --> 21:37.965
Wow, you guys stay working.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.724
Scusies, I got people to handle.

21:39.758 --> 21:40.586
Call you later?

21:40.620 --> 21:41.482
OK?

21:41.517 --> 21:42.344
OK.

21:42.379 --> 21:44.482
Bye, Uber.

21:44.517 --> 21:45.724
Actually, it's Cru--

21:45.758 --> 21:47.000
They always get it wrong.

21:47.034 --> 21:50.655
Sorry, look, thanks
again for dropping it off.

21:50.689 --> 21:52.379
What are you about to do?

21:52.413 --> 21:53.379
Excuse me?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.034
I mean, I don't have
anything on my agenda.

21:55.068 --> 21:56.620
And you just got
done working out.

21:56.655 --> 21:58.448
and you just gave me 10 bucks
like I'm your paper boy.

21:58.482 --> 22:00.896
Why don't we use this
$10 and go get some food?

22:00.931 --> 22:02.931
That's not gonna happen.

22:02.965 --> 22:05.758
I'm just a starving artist
that drove all the way

22:05.793 --> 22:07.620
over here to drop off your bag.

22:07.655 --> 22:09.517
Whatever, it's cool.

22:09.551 --> 22:11.758
I mean, who knows when
I'm going to eat again.

22:11.793 --> 22:14.379
I'm using this to pay for the
gas that I used to come over.

22:14.413 --> 22:14.965
It's cool.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.379
Enjoy your bag.

22:16.413 --> 22:17.448
All right, fine.

22:17.482 --> 22:19.551
Just a quick bite.

22:19.586 --> 22:20.413
Follow me.

22:23.068 --> 22:23.827
Gladly.

22:30.551 --> 22:32.413
See this highfalutin
heifer over here?

22:38.172 --> 22:41.689
So what track you
get caught tricking on?

22:41.724 --> 22:43.827
Oh, what's wrong?

22:43.862 --> 22:47.793
Your daddy couldn't
pay off the judge?

22:47.827 --> 22:49.827
Don't make her cry.

22:49.862 --> 22:51.000
Ms. Wilson,
thanks for waiting.

22:53.724 --> 22:55.103
Can you wait in my office.

22:55.137 --> 22:56.862
It's the last door on the
left, right around the corner.

22:56.896 --> 22:58.034
Can you make sure
Elaine gets that?

22:58.068 --> 22:59.379
- Yes.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

22:59.413 --> 23:00.172
- Nope.
- $200.

23:00.206 --> 23:00.862
Nope.

23:00.896 --> 23:02.103
Transfer her to my caseload.

23:02.137 --> 23:02.965
Never.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.482
Well, I guess I'll just
have to settle for you.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.448
What are the odds, hon?

23:13.482 --> 23:14.793
Hmm.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.172
Please, [inaudible].

23:23.620 --> 23:29.448
Well, Ms. Wilson, how
are you doing today?

23:29.482 --> 23:31.620
Good.

23:31.655 --> 23:33.620
Is that your wife?

23:33.655 --> 23:36.000
That is my wife and my child.

23:36.034 --> 23:37.000
They're beautiful.

23:37.034 --> 23:37.965
Thank you.

23:40.724 --> 23:43.103
Ms. Wilson, I have to say
that your conviction was

23:43.137 --> 23:47.724
for a rather violent
offense, felonious

23:47.758 --> 23:55.862
assault, extortion, attempted
murder, breaking and entering.

23:55.896 --> 23:58.172
And I see here some petty theft.

23:58.206 --> 23:59.758
But I did look at your file.

23:59.793 --> 24:01.275
I read it thoroughly,
in fact, and I

24:01.310 --> 24:06.586
did see the abuse that your
ex-boyfriend put you through.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.620
So you know I did
what I had to do.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.724
Sooner or later, he was
going to beat me to death.

24:11.758 --> 24:14.517
I just hope that piece of
shit gets his third strike

24:14.551 --> 24:15.965
and rots in jail.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.517
You hope he rots in jail, huh?

24:17.551 --> 24:18.931
Yeah.

24:18.965 --> 24:22.965
Ms. Wilson, that piece
of shit, as you put it,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.172
is the man you said
you loved, at least

24:24.206 --> 24:26.034
according to your statement.

24:26.068 --> 24:30.655
An educated, clearly
beautiful woman,

24:30.689 --> 24:36.137
decided to make a choice to
be with a drug dealing thug.

24:36.172 --> 24:38.517
This was the choice
that you made.

24:38.551 --> 24:40.206
He was the man you
decided to be with.

24:40.241 --> 24:42.275
I'm talking to you Ms. Wilson,
wasn't that your choice?

24:42.310 --> 24:42.896
Yes.

24:42.931 --> 24:44.034
You decided to do that.

24:44.068 --> 24:46.103
It's going to be your
choice to turn this around.

24:46.137 --> 24:47.724
It's going to be
your choice to make

24:47.758 --> 24:49.827
better decisions for yourself.

24:49.862 --> 24:51.000
Am I right?

24:51.034 --> 24:51.965
I asked you a
question, Ms. Wilson.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.551
Am I right?

24:53.586 --> 24:55.241
And it's going to be your
choice to change your life.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.103
And I hope you do.

25:00.137 --> 25:01.793
I'm not a criminal.

25:01.827 --> 25:03.344
Well, Ms. Wilson, the factthat you're sitting in my chair

25:03.379 --> 25:06.344
right now, the fact that
you're in my office, the fact

25:06.379 --> 25:08.724
that you are here
tells me otherwise.

25:08.758 --> 25:11.103
You nearly killed a man by
beating him with a flashlight.

25:11.137 --> 25:12.275
That was your choice.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.275
Are you ready to be transparent?

25:15.310 --> 25:17.896
Ms. Wilson, are you
ready to be transparent?

25:17.931 --> 25:19.103
I'm asking you a question.

25:19.137 --> 25:21.862
Are you ready to be
real with yourself?

25:21.896 --> 25:23.068
Yes.

25:23.103 --> 25:24.620
Because that's what
it's going to take.

25:24.655 --> 25:27.034
It's going to take you
being honest with yourself.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.172
I can't make that
choice for you.

25:28.206 --> 25:29.827
You have to do it.

25:29.862 --> 25:34.241
I'm here to help your transitionbe as smooth as possible.

25:34.275 --> 25:37.862
And I believe it will be.

25:37.896 --> 25:41.275
How can you be so sure, huh?

25:41.310 --> 25:42.586
Because this is what I do.

25:45.379 --> 25:48.275
Besides, the judge that
handled your conviction

25:48.310 --> 25:50.000
is a very good friend of mine.

25:50.034 --> 25:51.965
He's also an excellent
judge of character.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.620
And he's the reason
why you made parole.

25:54.655 --> 25:59.103
Well, since he's
such a good friend,

25:59.137 --> 26:01.655
why don't you ask him to
terminate my parole early?

26:01.689 --> 26:02.310
Uh-uh.

26:02.344 --> 26:03.413
Uh-uh.

26:03.448 --> 26:06.413
[laughs] That's not the
way this thing works, OK?

26:06.448 --> 26:07.931
You know better.

26:07.965 --> 26:09.241
Take this up to the front.

26:09.275 --> 26:12.758
Elaine will have a few more
things for you to sign.

26:12.793 --> 26:13.620
And good luck to you.

26:18.793 --> 26:20.379
Linda would like you
to file these, please.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.068
thank you.

26:21.103 --> 26:23.034
Thank you.

26:23.068 --> 26:24.310
Yes, Curtis?

26:24.344 --> 26:26.310
I need you to run a background
check on a Terrence Jacobs,

26:26.344 --> 26:29.655
any known addresses and
any known convictions.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.344
OK, who's Terrence
Jacobs and may I ask why?

26:32.379 --> 26:34.275
Just do this for me, please.

26:34.310 --> 26:35.931
Got it.

26:35.965 --> 26:36.931
Love the choker.

26:36.965 --> 26:38.344
[groans]

26:39.068 --> 26:39.862
OK.

26:52.172 --> 26:54.034
You know that fast food
is gonna catch up to you

26:54.068 --> 26:55.103
one day, right?

26:55.137 --> 26:56.965
You sound like my ex.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.206
She used to say the same thing.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.103
I said, as long as I'm
maintaining these abs,

27:00.137 --> 27:02.827
I'm not changing a single thing.

27:02.862 --> 27:05.862
Speaking of abs, my husband
used to say that, too.

27:05.896 --> 27:06.862
Oh, he works out.

27:06.896 --> 27:08.034
No, he used to.

27:08.068 --> 27:09.000
Well, not as much.

27:09.034 --> 27:11.103
Now he just works a lot.

27:11.137 --> 27:12.862
He's a parole officer.

27:12.896 --> 27:14.758
And what about you?

27:14.793 --> 27:16.103
Do you love your full
time gig of being

27:16.137 --> 27:18.413
a mom and making jewelry?

27:18.448 --> 27:20.827
Yeah.

27:20.862 --> 27:22.379
I mean, yes, of course.

27:22.413 --> 27:23.724
Why?

27:23.758 --> 27:25.172
I don't mean to
be out of line,

27:25.206 --> 27:28.000
but I just feel that you
just don't seem fulfilled.

27:28.034 --> 27:31.482
I-- OK, I mean, I was
blown away by your energy

27:31.517 --> 27:34.241
when you talked about modeling.

27:34.275 --> 27:35.241
Look at these.

27:38.827 --> 27:40.137
You did these?

27:40.172 --> 27:41.137
Yeah, yeah.

27:41.172 --> 27:42.862
I still build my portfolio.

27:42.896 --> 27:46.103
But my uncle says I get it
from my parents, I know.

27:46.137 --> 27:47.137
Both my parents were artists.

27:47.172 --> 27:49.827
But my mom, she--

27:49.862 --> 27:51.034
she was the photographer.

27:51.068 --> 27:52.862
She had a great eye.

27:52.896 --> 27:55.206
Does she still shoot?

27:55.241 --> 28:00.172
My, um-- my parents passed
away when I was seven,

28:00.206 --> 28:01.793
car accident.

28:01.827 --> 28:03.034
Oh my goodness.

28:03.068 --> 28:05.793
I'm so sorry.

28:05.827 --> 28:08.965
But don't-- you don't have
to get sentimental on me.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.206
I still have my uncle and
I still get to carry out

28:11.241 --> 28:14.034
their legacy through my photos.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.413
It makes me--

28:15.448 --> 28:17.896
It makes me feel alive.

28:17.931 --> 28:20.241
Oh, I know how you feel.

28:20.275 --> 28:22.034
Anything that
makes you feel like

28:22.068 --> 28:24.310
that, you gotta keep doing.

28:24.344 --> 28:25.965
But I'm sure you make
your uncle proud.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.965
And your folks would be, too.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.758
So how about we make
each other feel alive?

28:33.275 --> 28:35.862
Let me shoot you.

28:35.896 --> 28:36.482
Are you serious?

28:36.517 --> 28:38.000
I am dead serious.

28:38.034 --> 28:39.931
And you can even wear your
own jewelry to promote it.

28:43.827 --> 28:44.931
No, no, I can't.

28:44.965 --> 28:45.793
I can't.

28:45.827 --> 28:47.000
I don't have time.

28:47.034 --> 28:51.137
You just said you gave itall up for marriage and a baby.

28:51.172 --> 28:54.310
We can capture
that feeling again.

28:54.344 --> 28:56.000
Remember what it's
like to feel alive.

29:00.068 --> 29:01.310
I can't.

29:01.344 --> 29:02.310
Thank you for lunch.

29:09.517 --> 29:12.517
Pick up.

29:12.551 --> 29:16.137
Girl, that Cruise guy wants
to do a photo shoot on me.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.034
Huh?

29:18.068 --> 29:19.965
Uber, Uber guy.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.551
He's actually a part
time photographer.

29:21.586 --> 29:25.000
And I'm thinking I might beable to get a good portfolio out

29:25.034 --> 29:26.517
of it and start modeling again.

29:26.551 --> 29:28.862
Uh-huh.

29:28.896 --> 29:29.448
Tai?

29:29.482 --> 29:32.241
Mm-hmm, I'm listening.

29:32.275 --> 29:35.034
I know you are not
having sex right now.

29:35.068 --> 29:36.482
Girl, no.

29:36.517 --> 29:40.172
I'm just doing some
research for my blog.

29:40.206 --> 29:41.862
What the hell is
going on over there?

29:41.896 --> 29:43.137
TAI [ON PHONE]: Huh?

29:43.172 --> 29:45.137
SASHA [ON PHONE]:
What are you doing?

29:45.172 --> 29:46.310
No, I'm listening.
I'm listening.

29:46.344 --> 29:47.862
Go ahead.
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Oh, OK.

29:47.896 --> 29:50.068
So the Cruise guy, he's
actually a photographer.

29:50.103 --> 29:51.206
He's pretty good.

29:51.241 --> 29:52.482
So he wants to take
pictures of me.

29:52.517 --> 29:55.206
So I'm thinking that maybe I
can get my portfolio together.

29:55.241 --> 29:57.241
Girl, make sure you
wear the push up bra.

29:57.275 --> 29:58.448
Hey, um--

29:58.482 --> 29:59.448
SASHA [ON PHONE]:
That's a good idea.

29:59.482 --> 30:00.931
You got some extra condoms?

30:00.965 --> 30:02.241
Oh, hell no.

30:02.275 --> 30:03.344
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Tai?

30:03.379 --> 30:04.620
What do you
think you're doing?

30:04.655 --> 30:05.586
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Tai?
Are you listening to me?

30:05.620 --> 30:06.689
You, get out.

30:06.724 --> 30:07.862
What do you mean get out?
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Tai?

30:07.896 --> 30:08.758
Hold on.

30:08.793 --> 30:10.517
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

30:10.551 --> 30:12.275
I thought you was
the type of girl

30:12.310 --> 30:13.551
that wanted to use protection.

30:13.586 --> 30:14.620
But I don't-- Listen,
I don't mind going raw.

30:14.655 --> 30:15.517
Hm-mm.

30:15.551 --> 30:17.000
Like, that works
for me if you don't--

30:17.034 --> 30:18.379
Uh-uh.
You know what?

30:18.413 --> 30:20.068
I'm just-- I'm sorry, I'm
just not ready for all that.

30:20.103 --> 30:21.586
You're not ready for all what?

30:21.620 --> 30:24.000
You just had me in there eatingthe whole thing, groceries

30:24.034 --> 30:24.931
and all.

30:24.965 --> 30:27.275
And it was a fair job.

30:27.310 --> 30:28.620
But this is just the beginning.

30:28.655 --> 30:30.862
I don't want you to
think I'm like this.

30:30.896 --> 30:31.344
You know what?

30:31.379 --> 30:32.310
You know--

30:36.310 --> 30:37.379
SASHA [ON PHONE]: Tai?

30:37.413 --> 30:40.068
What kind of girl
you think I am?

30:40.103 --> 30:41.344
Hello?

30:41.379 --> 30:43.241
Are you with Perry?

30:43.275 --> 30:44.275
Hell no.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.000
Mm-hmm.

30:46.034 --> 30:47.034
You just be careful.

30:47.068 --> 30:48.241
You're playing a dangerous game.

30:48.275 --> 30:51.068
Oh, OK, speaking
of careful, what's

30:51.103 --> 30:52.620
going on with you and Uber?

30:52.655 --> 30:54.241
I mean, is this
photo shoot for real

30:54.275 --> 30:55.448
or is he going to
take pictures of you

30:55.482 --> 30:57.103
on his iPhone or something?

30:57.137 --> 30:59.103
You know you gotta watch
out for these psychos, girl?

30:59.137 --> 31:01.206
No, no, he's actually
pretty good from the photos

31:01.241 --> 31:02.241
he showed me.

31:02.275 --> 31:04.275
Mm-hmm, he sounds Craigslisty.

31:04.310 --> 31:05.137
You gonna tell Guy?

31:05.172 --> 31:06.586
I'm gonna tell him.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.310
After my portfolio is done.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.655
What?

31:09.689 --> 31:11.931
Once I start working
again, he'll be on board.

31:11.965 --> 31:13.620
Girl, you acting
like I haven't

31:13.655 --> 31:14.586
known you since high school.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.448
You can't hold water.

31:16.482 --> 31:17.551
Guy is going to find out.

31:17.586 --> 31:20.310
And his ass is
going to be pissed.

31:20.344 --> 31:21.620
There's nothing to find out.

31:21.655 --> 31:23.379
There's nothing to
be pissed about.

31:23.413 --> 31:25.172
You know he's a control freak.

31:25.206 --> 31:26.310
It's work.

31:26.344 --> 31:27.413
I'm not here to stop you.

31:27.448 --> 31:29.172
I'm the last one, girl.

31:29.206 --> 31:30.482
I want you to get
your whole life.

31:30.517 --> 31:34.965
All I got to say is CraigslistKillers, it made the news girl,

31:35.000 --> 31:35.586
it's real.

31:38.068 --> 31:38.931
Daddy.

31:38.965 --> 31:39.862
Mm-hmm.

31:39.896 --> 31:42.482
I need you to sign
my permission slip.

31:42.517 --> 31:45.551
You think you can
come with me tomorrow?

31:45.586 --> 31:46.965
Oh, tomorrow, baby?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.931
Yeah, I really
want you to come.

31:48.965 --> 31:51.620
Sweetie, I got a
whole lot to do at work.

31:51.655 --> 31:53.620
So I don't think I'll
be able to make it.

31:53.655 --> 31:56.965
Now, listen, what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna take all of us

31:57.000 --> 32:00.655
as a family out to the
Santa Monica Pier real soon.

32:00.689 --> 32:02.103
And we can ride the rides?

32:02.137 --> 32:05.448
Of course, we can
ride the rides, girl.

32:05.482 --> 32:08.620
Yes, thanks, daddy.

32:08.655 --> 32:10.241
Now, go and get that
permission slip, OK?

32:10.275 --> 32:11.172
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

32:21.482 --> 32:22.551
Permission slip
in the morning.

32:22.586 --> 32:24.103
Go take a shower.

32:24.137 --> 32:25.068
SKYLA: Oh, mom.

32:29.034 --> 32:33.172
Are you sure you're going to
be able to clear a Saturday?

32:33.206 --> 32:35.172
It's not like you've been
the most accessible lately.

32:38.275 --> 32:40.103
Accessible, Sasha?

32:40.137 --> 32:43.551
You can reach me on my cell
phone any time you want to.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.241
But getting a hold of you
between your girlfriend

32:46.275 --> 32:50.724
meetings and your workouts, it'sa whole other story, ain't it?

32:50.758 --> 32:53.344
My workout schedule has
been the same for months.

32:53.379 --> 32:57.137
Excuse me for spending timewith my best friend once a week.

32:57.172 --> 33:00.758
Should I have, like, checkedin with you first, Mr. Officer?

33:06.413 --> 33:07.482
You know something,
you're right.

33:07.517 --> 33:09.655
That was wrong.

33:09.689 --> 33:10.758
I shouldn't have said that.

33:10.793 --> 33:11.586
My bad.

33:15.275 --> 33:17.172
It's just this job, girl.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.137
I been stressed out.

33:18.172 --> 33:20.241
Work load has been crazy.

33:24.344 --> 33:28.310
You know, I've been thinkingof remodelling this whole spot,

33:28.344 --> 33:30.310
dining room,
kitchen, living room,

33:30.344 --> 33:31.482
the whole nine, just a redo.

33:35.344 --> 33:36.620
I know how much you
love remodeling.

33:36.655 --> 33:40.034
Maybe it would be a nice littlebreak from your jewelry line.

33:40.068 --> 33:40.758
Maybe.

33:40.793 --> 33:42.620
Maybe.

33:42.655 --> 33:46.448
Lord knows, I get bored
as hell around this house.

33:46.482 --> 33:49.655
I could put up some
of my old work.

33:49.689 --> 33:53.482
Maybe even add a
few more photos.

33:53.517 --> 33:56.379
Are you still on that?

33:56.413 --> 33:57.655
I'm trying to talk
about new stuff

33:57.689 --> 33:59.413
and you keep on talking
about these old hobbies.

33:59.448 --> 34:00.586
Hobbies?

34:00.620 --> 34:02.241
Yes, hobbies.

34:02.275 --> 34:04.482
I seem to remember
making as much as you.

34:04.517 --> 34:05.655
Oh, Sasha, please.

34:05.689 --> 34:07.448
And I was on hold
for two cover shoots

34:07.482 --> 34:08.586
before I got married
and had Skyla.

34:08.620 --> 34:09.793
All right, listen,
you know, I'm

34:09.827 --> 34:11.275
so sorry that you did
not make the cover

34:11.310 --> 34:12.517
of "Keen Magazine," all right?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.137
Oh, yeah, "Keen
Magazine," right--

34:14.172 --> 34:15.793
Well, listen, I don't want
you to be on any cover, Sasha.

34:15.827 --> 34:18.379
We talked about-- we've had thisdiscussion a thousand times.

34:18.413 --> 34:21.517
I do not want my wife on
the cover of any magazine.

34:21.551 --> 34:23.413
I don't want you doing
these cover shoots,

34:23.448 --> 34:25.275
dudes falling all over you.

34:25.310 --> 34:26.793
It drives me crazy, all right?

34:26.827 --> 34:30.655
Just be my wife
and be the mother

34:30.689 --> 34:31.620
of our daughter, that's it.

34:31.655 --> 34:32.793
I'm working--

34:32.827 --> 34:34.413
I don't even wanna talk
about it no more, all right?

34:34.448 --> 34:35.689
This is over.

34:35.724 --> 34:37.172
We already talked about
this a million times.

34:37.206 --> 34:39.103
Sasha, please, don't even
mention this with me.

34:39.137 --> 34:40.551
I am more than a
wife and a mother.

34:40.586 --> 34:41.586
I know you are more
than a wife and a mother.

34:41.620 --> 34:43.172
I have things I want to do.

34:43.206 --> 34:43.689
Got it, Sasha.

34:43.724 --> 34:45.344
I know, I'm aware.

34:45.379 --> 34:46.896
This is not just
about you, Guy.

34:46.931 --> 34:48.862
I'm in this relationship, too.

34:48.896 --> 34:53.827
Look, I want more than thishouse and my damn jewelry line.

34:53.862 --> 34:57.551
Babe, I just want to go back
to doing what I love again,

34:57.586 --> 34:59.620
modeling while I still got it.

34:59.655 --> 35:03.793
Sasha, where in the hell
is this coming from, babe?

35:03.827 --> 35:04.724
What you gonna do?

35:04.758 --> 35:06.551
Be a professional model?

35:06.586 --> 35:07.931
Well, what's wrong with that?

35:07.965 --> 35:09.379
And what happens
to our baby girl

35:09.413 --> 35:11.620
why you out there chasing
your dream, Sasha?

35:11.655 --> 35:12.896
Did Tai put you up to this?

35:12.931 --> 35:14.172
No.

35:14.206 --> 35:17.689
I swear to god I'm out hereevery single day busting my ass

35:17.724 --> 35:19.413
to make sure I give youeverything I ever promised you,

35:19.448 --> 35:22.206
everything you ever wanted,
everything you ever wanted,

35:22.241 --> 35:23.068
Sasha.

35:23.103 --> 35:24.551
So I'm sorry if
being married to me

35:24.586 --> 35:25.862
doesn't make you
completely happy!

35:25.896 --> 35:28.689
Oh, you stop
twisting my words, Guy.

35:28.724 --> 35:29.931
I'm not twisting your words!

35:29.965 --> 35:32.310
You know damn well
I only wanted to stop

35:32.344 --> 35:33.586
until Skyla went to school.

35:33.620 --> 35:34.724
The answer is no!

35:34.758 --> 35:36.241
Do you understand me?

35:36.275 --> 35:37.275
The answer is no!

35:37.310 --> 35:38.793
So stop pushing me on
your damn pipe dreams!

35:43.206 --> 35:44.827
SKYLA: Mom?

35:44.862 --> 35:45.517
OK.

35:45.551 --> 35:46.344
OK.

35:52.517 --> 35:53.827
Sasha.

35:53.862 --> 35:55.827
SKYLA: Mom, are you OK?

35:55.862 --> 35:56.896
SASHA: I'm coming, Skyla.

36:29.413 --> 36:30.965
I have a good resume.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.965
It's not like I don't
have work experience,

36:33.000 --> 36:34.482
but I can't even
get an interview.

36:34.517 --> 36:35.413
I don't know what to do.

36:38.827 --> 36:41.310
Mr. Curtis?

36:41.344 --> 36:43.655
Mr. Curtis?

36:43.689 --> 36:44.931
Yeah.

36:44.965 --> 36:46.827
Obviously, something's wrong.

36:46.862 --> 36:49.344
You want to talk about it?

36:49.379 --> 36:51.310
With you?

36:51.344 --> 36:52.931
What's wrong with me?

36:52.965 --> 36:54.517
Nothing's wrong with you.

36:54.551 --> 36:56.275
I shouldn't have said that.

36:56.310 --> 36:57.586
I'm sorry.

36:57.620 --> 37:04.517
It's just, um-- just
going through some--

37:04.551 --> 37:08.413
some tough times right
now, deeply personal.

37:11.034 --> 37:13.379
The reason why I'm dealing
with what I'm dealing with

37:13.413 --> 37:16.724
is because I never talked
to anybody about it.

37:16.758 --> 37:18.827
Whatever it is,
it helps to talk.

37:23.586 --> 37:28.862
Yeah, you are right.

37:28.896 --> 37:31.517
It would help to talk.

37:31.551 --> 37:34.517
Do you like Japanese?

37:34.551 --> 37:35.448
No.

37:35.482 --> 37:36.310
You don't?

37:36.344 --> 37:37.000
OK.

37:37.034 --> 37:38.448
Well, it's your treat then.

37:38.482 --> 37:39.758
Let's go.

37:39.793 --> 37:40.965
But I get to pick, right?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.586
You get to pick.
You get to pick.

37:42.620 --> 37:43.517
- Awesome.
- Don't be pushy.

37:50.827 --> 37:53.586
This was such a good call.

37:53.620 --> 37:55.896
I don't know when was the last
time I had a good hot dog.

37:59.103 --> 38:01.517
You should indulge more often.

38:01.551 --> 38:02.551
Please, my wife would kill me.

38:06.586 --> 38:09.931
She has me on a strict diet,wants me to stay lean and mean.

38:09.965 --> 38:13.931
So I would kill for a Krispy
Kreme doughnut, though.

38:13.965 --> 38:17.620
I haven't had one
since my honeymoon.

38:17.655 --> 38:18.896
Well, you look good to me.

38:21.482 --> 38:23.793
Women like men with a
little size on them.

38:23.827 --> 38:26.724
Makes them feel protected.

38:26.758 --> 38:27.827
Protected?

38:27.862 --> 38:29.379
Mm-hmm.

38:29.413 --> 38:30.379
OK.

38:30.413 --> 38:32.000
When was the last time
you felt protected?

38:36.482 --> 38:38.965
Terrence, stop!

38:39.000 --> 38:40.379
Off me, Terrence!

38:40.413 --> 38:41.000
Stop it!

38:47.482 --> 38:48.724
Let-- Let go!

38:48.758 --> 38:49.655
Let go of me!

38:49.689 --> 38:51.827
Get up off her!

38:51.862 --> 38:53.896
[slapping]

38:58.689 --> 39:00.620
[exertion sounds]

39:02.965 --> 39:04.793
I don't remember.

39:04.827 --> 39:07.206
But sometimes I
wish I could just

39:07.241 --> 39:11.482
get off these papers so I can
move to Denver, start fresh,

39:11.517 --> 39:12.896
you know?

39:12.931 --> 39:14.862
Be free.

39:14.896 --> 39:18.172
It's so beautiful
in the mountains.

39:18.206 --> 39:20.551
What about you?

39:20.586 --> 39:22.172
What about me?

39:22.206 --> 39:24.620
Do you ever wish that you
could do something else

39:24.655 --> 39:27.620
or do you like your job?

39:27.655 --> 39:29.448
My job pays the bills.

39:29.482 --> 39:30.862
When you have a
family to support,

39:30.896 --> 39:32.551
sometimes you have to
put your dreams on hold.

39:32.586 --> 39:34.862
You know what I mean?

39:34.896 --> 39:36.034
I think you're being modest.

39:36.068 --> 39:37.172
You're actually really
good at your job.

39:41.068 --> 39:42.586
I can't remember the
last time someone

39:42.620 --> 39:43.413
knew this much about me.

39:47.896 --> 39:50.586
I just try to take
care of what's mine.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.724
Well, I hope that
someone's working just

39:52.758 --> 39:53.896
as hard to take care of you.

39:58.724 --> 40:00.137
I, uh--

40:00.172 --> 40:01.758
I gotta go.

40:01.793 --> 40:05.000
I got a 3 o'clock
and I gotta roll.

40:08.482 --> 40:09.206
Be good.

40:09.241 --> 40:10.000
Hold on.

40:17.862 --> 40:21.655
There, now go violate someone.

40:21.689 --> 40:23.034
[laughs]

40:23.068 --> 40:28.103
[SINGING] It's an empty
space where you used to live.

40:28.137 --> 40:32.034
Now, I'm forced to be
here wishing you the best.

40:32.068 --> 40:33.862
I can't even fool
a nine-year-old.

40:33.896 --> 40:35.448
She knows I'm not happy.

40:35.482 --> 40:39.034
And since when are you
all of a sudden not happy?

40:39.068 --> 40:41.655
Look, if the photo shoot
means that much to you,

40:41.689 --> 40:42.827
then just do it.

40:42.862 --> 40:44.724
Have you read my newest blog?

40:44.758 --> 40:48.068
It's called getting your
life when you're the wife.

40:48.103 --> 40:48.896
Yeah.

40:48.931 --> 40:50.172
Yeah, I read it.
- All right, girl.

40:50.206 --> 40:51.551
Well, I'm working
on a new one now.

40:51.586 --> 40:52.931
Can I hit you back?

40:52.965 --> 40:55.206
Is Perry there?

40:55.241 --> 40:57.103
Girl, bye.

40:57.137 --> 40:57.965
Bye.

41:00.551 --> 41:02.931
TAI [VOICEOVER]: I guess we
all want what we can't have.

41:02.965 --> 41:05.655
My best friend looks
at me and sees freedom.

41:05.689 --> 41:07.551
But what I want is
the kind of freedom

41:07.586 --> 41:10.931
she has, freedom to
lose yourself and not be

41:10.965 --> 41:13.275
afraid of where it leads you.

41:13.310 --> 41:15.586
The thing about that
race to the altar

41:15.620 --> 41:18.517
is that it gives you a
false sense of finishing.

41:18.551 --> 41:21.758
The reality is you're just
running to start a new race.

41:21.793 --> 41:26.655
And this race isn't aboutwinning, it's about staying in.

41:26.689 --> 41:29.931
It looks like somebody is
ready for the big picture day.

41:29.965 --> 41:32.137
Come here, baby.

41:32.172 --> 41:35.241
Make sure Ms. Marcy gets a
whole lot of shots of you, OK?

41:35.275 --> 41:38.000
I'm going to be
a model like mommy.

41:38.034 --> 41:39.758
OK, let's hurry.

41:39.793 --> 41:40.793
Give your daddy a hug.

41:40.827 --> 41:41.931
Love you, girl

41:41.965 --> 41:42.793

want you to do

up for a let down.

need to audition these men.

particular case with Faren

49:03.620 --> 49:06.275

needed the car for work.

see you by Friday

was cut that lying
cunt loose, man.

to say that those condoms--

49:59.758 --> 50:01.448
The condoms weren't
yours, I know.

50:01.482 --> 50:03.379
You told me three times.

You know, I'll listen.

50:21.241 --> 50:23.310
No judgment.

50:23.344 --> 50:28.724
Relationships are crazy, man,
you know, particularly when--

50:28.758 --> 50:30.620
when the person you're
with starts changing

50:30.655 --> 50:35.310
things up and just
making you feel like you

50:35.344 --> 50:36.310

found out who that clown was

she did that.

What?

51:49.482 --> 51:52.689
He found my new email.

51:52.724 --> 51:55.172
I actually thought that I
could put this behind me.

51:55.206 --> 51:56.793
I'm so damn stupid.

51:56.827 --> 51:58.344

51:58.379 --> 51:59.517
No, no, no, just calm down.
Calm down, calm down.

52:01.724 --> 52:04.551
I have to go to your

52:04.586 --> 52:05.862
I planned on doing it next week.

52:05.896 --> 52:07.758
But I'll just do it now, OK?

52:07.793 --> 52:11.448
I'll go by, make sure
everything's fine

52:11.482 --> 52:14.448

I'll get my truck,

I see you've met Nadine.

52:25.758 --> 52:27.310
Did you bring options?

52:27.344 --> 52:28.724
Absolutely.

52:28.758 --> 52:31.793
You can go through my bag
and tell me what you think.

52:31.827 --> 52:35.689
So Lance tells me you
were kind of a big deal

52:35.724 --> 52:36.689
when you were modeling.

52:36.724 --> 52:38.931
Oh, no, he's exaggerating.

52:38.965 --> 52:40.551
I did well, don't get me wrong.

52:40.586 --> 52:42.689
But I quit after I got married.

Uh, men, they want
you because you're hot,

you to cool down.

Whoa, whoa, hey, not all men.

52:49.758 --> 52:51.620
And do a soft lip on her.

52:51.655 --> 52:53.551
It's one of her best features.

52:53.586 --> 52:54.551
OK.

52:54.586 --> 52:58.586
So this is just moisturizer.

52:58.620 --> 53:02.241

53:02.275 --> 53:05.965
I was lucky to get it

The owners of the main house
are always out of town,

53:07.896 --> 53:11.862

53:11.896 --> 53:16.517

to do these checks, you know?

53:16.551 --> 53:17.655

53:33.413 --> 53:35.344
Do you have any other way
he can get in this place?

53:35.379 --> 53:37.862
No.

53:37.896 --> 53:38.689
OK.

1:01:32.793 --> 1:01:34.724
I love you.

1:01:34.758 --> 1:01:37.034
I love you.

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:38.275
I love you, too.

1:01:38.310 --> 1:01:41.034
[SINGING] When it's
time to close the door,

1:01:41.068 --> 1:01:44.344
should we [inaudible].

1:01:44.379 --> 1:01:48.034
Make wrong feel right?

1:01:48.068 --> 1:01:53.000
Be prepared to fight to win.

1:01:53.034 --> 1:01:54.413
I can tell you it's goodbye.

1:01:59.310 --> 1:02:01.482
You better say it
before sunrise.

1:02:09.344 --> 1:02:17.000
I won't deny my heart
when it speaks to me.

1:02:17.034 --> 1:02:19.965
You OK, girl?

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.379
We need to talk.

1:02:22.413 --> 1:02:23.206
OK.

1:02:32.517 --> 1:02:33.655
Ouch.

1:02:33.689 --> 1:02:35.931
Just wanted to make sure
everyone's pushing themselves

1:02:35.965 --> 1:02:37.413
all the way.

1:02:37.448 --> 1:02:41.482
Be a shame to do all this work
and not see no results, right?

1:02:41.517 --> 1:02:46.827
I told you I was sorry fornot committing to the exercises.

1:02:50.379 --> 1:02:53.206
All right, class dismissed.

1:02:53.241 --> 1:02:55.310
Make sure you drink lots
of water, all right?

1:02:55.344 --> 1:02:59.310
I want to make sure you
stay as cool as possible.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.034
I'm thinking we need
to find another class.

1:03:08.068 --> 1:03:08.862
Girl, please.

1:03:13.586 --> 1:03:17.620
You just lucky you don't
have to deal with this shit.

1:03:17.655 --> 1:03:20.517
All right, what's going
on with you, girl?

1:03:20.551 --> 1:03:23.103
And if you're about to give me
another one of your morality

1:03:23.137 --> 1:03:25.413
speeches, you can
save your breath.

1:03:25.448 --> 1:03:26.517
Because you're right.

1:03:26.551 --> 1:03:29.034
And you've been right, OK?

1:03:29.068 --> 1:03:33.103
I'm gonna stop window shopping
and I'm gonna buy, eventually.

1:03:33.137 --> 1:03:36.103
It's just that these guys
are so emotional nowadays.

1:03:36.137 --> 1:03:39.206
It's like they're the
ones looking for the ring.

1:03:39.241 --> 1:03:43.310
Wow, you're settling down.

1:03:43.344 --> 1:03:45.137
I'm proud of you, Tai.

1:03:45.172 --> 1:03:47.586
Now all you need is a man
who loves your crazy ass,

1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:49.862
has his own career,
and will support yours.

1:03:49.896 --> 1:03:52.103
Damn, you sound like
you should be writing

1:03:52.137 --> 1:03:55.206
a relationship blog, not me.

1:03:55.241 --> 1:03:57.103
But I look up to you, girl.

1:03:57.137 --> 1:03:59.586
Real talk.

1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:02.034
Oh my god, I'm monopolizing.

1:04:02.068 --> 1:04:04.068
What did you want to
talk about earlier?

1:04:04.103 --> 1:04:07.172
Hey, I'll call you, OK?

1:04:07.206 --> 1:04:08.310
I'll tell you.

1:04:08.344 --> 1:04:09.310
Ooh, I need you
to call me tonight.

1:04:09.344 --> 1:04:10.482
OK, yeah.

1:04:10.517 --> 1:04:12.241
Lance, what are you doing here?

1:04:12.275 --> 1:04:15.034
I have a surprise for you.

1:04:15.068 --> 1:04:16.482
Guy Curtis speaking.

1:04:16.517 --> 1:04:18.103
Hey, guy, it's Faren.

1:04:18.137 --> 1:04:21.275
Uh, you should take off.

1:04:21.310 --> 1:04:22.517
Hey, listen, I'm
working right now.

1:04:22.551 --> 1:04:24.275
Can I hit you a
little bit later.

1:04:24.310 --> 1:04:25.310
Can't you take a quick break?

1:04:25.344 --> 1:04:26.689
I want to give you something.

1:04:26.724 --> 1:04:29.034
I'm outside now.

1:04:29.068 --> 1:04:32.068
Faren, listen, I'm
working on your case.

1:04:32.103 --> 1:04:33.517
I have a lot of work to do.

1:04:33.551 --> 1:04:34.931
Let's just deal with this a
little bit later, all right?

1:04:34.965 --> 1:04:35.517
I'm in lingerie.

1:04:38.206 --> 1:04:39.965
Faren, I have to go.

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.344
I can't talk to you
about this right now.

1:04:41.379 --> 1:04:43.551
Yo, buddy, listen,
Elaine's out sick,

1:04:43.586 --> 1:04:45.241
so I'm picking up lunches.

1:04:45.275 --> 1:04:46.310
I'm thinking burgers.

1:04:46.344 --> 1:04:48.137
Can I sneak you something?

1:04:48.172 --> 1:04:49.586
Sasha, hey, how are you?

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:51.000
I'm thinking
nothing but veggies.

1:04:51.034 --> 1:04:51.689
I gotta go.

1:04:51.724 --> 1:04:52.310
Talk to you soon, all right?

1:04:52.344 --> 1:04:53.206
Bye-bye.

1:04:53.241 --> 1:04:54.344
I am so sorry.

1:04:57.482 --> 1:04:59.206
Faren, listen, I can't
deal with this right now--

1:04:59.241 --> 1:05:03.344
Well, that's a new greeting.

1:05:03.379 --> 1:05:07.034
Linda, Linda, um, Faren--

1:05:07.068 --> 1:05:10.413
Ms. Wilson, Ms. Wilson was
just a very difficult case.

1:05:10.448 --> 1:05:11.620
And I'm just trying
to deal with it.

1:05:11.655 --> 1:05:13.413
But there are some difficulties.

1:05:13.448 --> 1:05:15.586
It's all being smoothed out.

1:05:15.620 --> 1:05:17.482
Listen, I know you
have a history of being

1:05:17.517 --> 1:05:20.034
very stern with your parolees.

1:05:20.068 --> 1:05:23.068
But you might need to lean a
little extra hard on this one

1:05:23.103 --> 1:05:24.310
to keep her in line.

1:05:24.344 --> 1:05:25.620
I agree.

1:05:25.655 --> 1:05:29.241
Women can be very shifty
and complicated, OK?

1:05:29.275 --> 1:05:30.689
Couldn't agree more.

1:05:30.724 --> 1:05:34.275
There are some problems,
but you know I'm on it.

1:05:34.310 --> 1:05:35.758
Good.

1:05:35.793 --> 1:05:38.482
Because we just don't hand out
promotions like candy bars.

1:05:42.034 --> 1:05:44.551
OK, bye-bye.

1:05:44.586 --> 1:05:46.413
She hung up on
you, didn't she?

1:05:46.448 --> 1:05:48.034
Listen, I'm gonna
go pick up a burger.

1:05:48.068 --> 1:05:48.758
No, no, no, no, no.

1:05:48.793 --> 1:05:51.517
Just, um, you know something?

1:05:51.551 --> 1:05:55.310
I have to deal with some
things, big emergency.

1:05:55.344 --> 1:05:57.482
So I'll get lunch, all right?

1:05:57.517 --> 1:05:58.586
My treat.

1:05:58.620 --> 1:06:00.172
Wow, hey, whoa,
whoa, listen, man.

1:06:00.206 --> 1:06:02.310
You cannot let a woman
stress you out like this,

1:06:02.344 --> 1:06:03.413
even if she's the boss.

1:06:03.448 --> 1:06:04.586
It's unhealthy.

1:06:04.620 --> 1:06:06.103
- You're absolutely right.
- OK.

1:06:06.137 --> 1:06:07.827
OK, listen, bourbon,
refrigerator, take care.

1:06:07.862 --> 1:06:09.310
Nice.

1:06:09.344 --> 1:06:11.068
Bourbon, I like this office.

1:06:28.586 --> 1:06:30.517
I don't think
this is a good idea.

1:06:30.551 --> 1:06:31.724
Relax, my friends are chill.

1:06:31.758 --> 1:06:34.689
You'll have a good
time, I promise.

1:06:34.724 --> 1:06:37.034
And who do we have here?

1:06:37.068 --> 1:06:39.241
Felipe, this is my
good friend Sasha.

1:06:39.275 --> 1:06:41.034
Sasha, this is Felipe.

1:06:41.068 --> 1:06:42.482
Felipe sets the
test menus for some

1:06:42.517 --> 1:06:43.724
of the best restaurants in LA.

1:06:43.758 --> 1:06:46.206
Not some of the best, all.

1:06:49.172 --> 1:06:51.655
He's so modest.

1:06:51.689 --> 1:06:55.068
So who is this
beautiful creature?

1:06:55.103 --> 1:06:56.448
Hi, I'm Sasha.

1:06:56.482 --> 1:07:00.482
Lance and I, we're just friends.

1:07:00.517 --> 1:07:02.137
Well, come on in, please.

1:07:06.344 --> 1:07:07.517
Hello, stranger.

1:07:07.551 --> 1:07:10.344
Nadine, Lance didn't
tell me you'd be here.

1:07:10.379 --> 1:07:14.379
Yeah, well, we do these little
soirees like once a month.

1:07:14.413 --> 1:07:17.758
Oh, this is-- this
my husband Josh.

1:07:17.793 --> 1:07:20.827
My dear, you are
absolutely stunning.

1:07:20.862 --> 1:07:22.034
Oh.

1:07:22.068 --> 1:07:24.827
Lance, where did you find
such an object of perfection?

1:07:24.862 --> 1:07:27.896
Sometimes fate brings
two people together.

1:07:27.931 --> 1:07:29.379
Or eight.

1:07:29.413 --> 1:07:30.827
[laughs]

1:07:33.896 --> 1:07:35.206
It's delicious.

1:07:35.241 --> 1:07:36.379
Oh, well, come on.

1:07:36.413 --> 1:07:37.689
You know how my chef does.

1:07:44.689 --> 1:07:46.241
To new friends.

1:07:46.275 --> 1:07:47.310
- Yes.
- Yes, cheers.

1:07:47.344 --> 1:07:48.172
Cheers.

1:07:48.206 --> 1:07:48.862
Cheers.

1:07:48.896 --> 1:07:51.275
[clinking]

1:08:02.379 --> 1:08:06.241
Faren, no more stunts
like that, OK, not ever.

1:08:06.275 --> 1:08:07.310
That's my job.

1:08:07.344 --> 1:08:08.793
You can't ever--

1:08:08.827 --> 1:08:09.724
Why are you smiling?

1:08:09.758 --> 1:08:10.586
Are you listening to me?

1:08:10.620 --> 1:08:11.896
Of course.

1:08:11.931 --> 1:08:14.724
But I'm also listening
to what you don't say.

1:08:14.758 --> 1:08:16.310
And you are too
stressed out, Guy.

1:08:16.344 --> 1:08:17.448
You need to relax.

1:08:17.482 --> 1:08:18.931
Yeah, yeah, I'm
stressed out, all right?

1:08:18.965 --> 1:08:21.689
I am stressed out because Igot a promotion coming, my job.

1:08:21.724 --> 1:08:23.206
My boss is on my back.

1:08:23.241 --> 1:08:24.724
Your boyfriend, all
right, he's stalking

1:08:24.758 --> 1:08:26.172
you, probably stalking me.

1:08:26.206 --> 1:08:27.758
So yeah, I'm a little
bit stressed, I'm sorry.

1:08:27.793 --> 1:08:29.206
I want to apologize for that.

1:08:35.482 --> 1:08:36.275
What are you doing?

1:08:41.655 --> 1:08:42.758
You gonna sit?

1:08:46.655 --> 1:08:47.965
You know you can't
just buy me off

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.517
with a Krispy Kreme doughnut.

1:08:49.551 --> 1:08:50.931
I love Krispy Kreme.

1:08:50.965 --> 1:08:51.758
I know.

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.827
And I have a lot
of making up to do.

1:09:07.724 --> 1:09:09.517
That was delicious, Felipe.

1:09:09.551 --> 1:09:10.827
Thank you.

1:09:10.862 --> 1:09:13.344
Just a little something I threwtogether for some old friends

1:09:13.379 --> 1:09:15.241
and one new one.

1:09:15.275 --> 1:09:17.724
Oh, hey, you guys have to
see the images from the shoot

1:09:17.758 --> 1:09:18.931
I did with Sasha.

1:09:18.965 --> 1:09:21.379
When I tell you the
images are stellar,

1:09:21.413 --> 1:09:22.758
it is not an exaggeration.

1:09:22.793 --> 1:09:24.000
No, he's not lying.

1:09:24.034 --> 1:09:26.758
I mean, I hardly did
any makeup on her.

1:09:26.793 --> 1:09:29.620
I just highlighted
her natural beauty.

1:09:29.655 --> 1:09:33.793
Yeah, that's all Nadine keptraving about when she got home.

1:09:33.827 --> 1:09:38.517
So I'm like, I had
to meet this woman.

1:09:38.551 --> 1:09:40.620
I absolutely must
see those photos.

1:09:40.655 --> 1:09:45.344
You know, Lance, you shot
our little engagement soiree.

1:09:45.379 --> 1:09:47.310
Yes, he did it.

1:09:47.344 --> 1:09:50.862
It was an Adam and Eve type
of vibe, botanical gardens.

1:09:50.896 --> 1:09:54.655
We were one with
the elements, nude,

1:09:54.689 --> 1:09:56.517
very sexy and very sensual.

1:09:56.551 --> 1:09:57.379
Very sensual.

1:09:57.413 --> 1:09:58.931
Very, very sensual

1:09:58.965 --> 1:10:00.413
You were very sensual.

1:10:08.551 --> 1:10:09.482
I'm sorry, guys.

1:10:09.517 --> 1:10:10.655
I'm sorry.

1:10:10.689 --> 1:10:11.862
You know how much
I love this woman.

1:10:11.896 --> 1:10:14.862
And you know that
we don't mind at all.

1:10:17.931 --> 1:10:21.862
You know, Lance, I noticed
the other day that you

1:10:21.896 --> 1:10:23.931
are looking a lot leaner.

1:10:23.965 --> 1:10:27.655
I mean, whatever you're doing,
it looks really good on you.

1:10:27.689 --> 1:10:28.931
Mm, thanks.

1:10:28.965 --> 1:10:32.793
Yeah, I doubled my
cardio, upped my protein.

1:10:32.827 --> 1:10:33.862
It feels good.

1:10:38.586 --> 1:10:45.965
This is a little something
I made especially for you.

1:10:50.379 --> 1:10:52.758
[laughing]

1:10:54.689 --> 1:10:55.689
Here you go.

1:10:58.413 --> 1:10:59.931
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1:10:59.965 --> 1:11:01.586
Some things are
meant to be tasted

1:11:01.620 --> 1:11:05.620
with a certain part of the
palate, not the whole mouth.

1:11:05.655 --> 1:11:08.793
OK, so just taste it at the tip.

1:11:16.655 --> 1:11:19.413
Wow.

1:11:19.448 --> 1:11:21.517
That's delicious.

1:11:21.551 --> 1:11:26.000
Yeah, that's exactly
how I like to taste it.

1:11:26.034 --> 1:11:31.724
You know, I just love spending
time with close friends.

1:11:31.758 --> 1:11:33.000
Pleasure's all ours.

1:11:38.517 --> 1:11:41.931
Just loosen up.

1:11:41.965 --> 1:11:43.965
You got your whole
life to be a tight ass.

1:11:49.482 --> 1:11:50.413
This is ridiculous.

1:11:50.448 --> 1:11:51.689
You taste good.

1:11:51.724 --> 1:11:57.000
[MUSIC - SHIREEN CRUTCHFIELD,

1:12:03.931 --> 1:12:06.896
[SINGING] You got
me feeling weaker.

1:12:06.931 --> 1:12:11.965
I don't want for this
to be like it's a rush--

1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.068
Faren, this is ridiculous.

1:12:16.793 --> 1:12:18.068
A little aperitif?

1:12:18.103 --> 1:12:21.413
[SINGING] You got me weaker.

1:12:21.448 --> 1:12:22.413
I don't want.

1:12:22.448 --> 1:12:23.724
I don't want.

1:12:23.758 --> 1:12:25.379
I don't want.

1:12:25.413 --> 1:12:26.068
I don't want.

1:12:26.103 --> 1:12:31.034
I don't want to fall.

1:12:31.068 --> 1:12:36.103
You got me, you,
you got me weaker.

1:12:36.137 --> 1:12:37.137
You're the one.

1:12:37.172 --> 1:12:42.379
And I'm trying my best
not to show excitement.

1:12:42.413 --> 1:12:45.931
Breaking me down
like it's a science.

1:12:45.965 --> 1:12:48.517
Touching me there,
kissing me there.

1:12:48.551 --> 1:12:49.793
I'm like, no.

1:12:49.827 --> 1:12:53.137
You know, small,
custom-made pieces,

1:12:53.172 --> 1:12:55.793
nothing major, but it's mine.

1:12:55.827 --> 1:12:57.655
She is being way too modest.

1:12:57.689 --> 1:13:00.689
Sasha's jewelry is some of the
best jewelry I've ever seen,

1:13:00.724 --> 1:13:02.172
very, very provocative stuff.

1:13:02.206 --> 1:13:03.482
Come on.

1:13:03.517 --> 1:13:04.586
Is that so?

1:13:04.620 --> 1:13:06.620
You know I've been looking
for a sexy replacement

1:13:06.655 --> 1:13:09.551
for my lower dumbbell.

1:13:09.586 --> 1:13:11.000
What's a dumbbell?

1:13:11.034 --> 1:13:12.000
Oh, you know.

1:13:15.896 --> 1:13:17.517
Oh, yeah.

1:13:17.551 --> 1:13:18.827
OK.

1:13:18.862 --> 1:13:21.034
I like to switch it
up every now and then.

1:13:21.068 --> 1:13:23.517
I read this blog
that says, you know,

1:13:23.551 --> 1:13:25.620
if you switch up you
look with your partner,

1:13:25.655 --> 1:13:28.103
he thinks you're a new woman.

1:13:28.137 --> 1:13:32.172
I happen to like your little
friend just the way she is.

1:13:32.206 --> 1:13:34.655
I know you do.

1:13:34.689 --> 1:13:38.137
You know, I think you
should get one of those.

1:13:50.965 --> 1:13:52.827
You guys relax, OK?

1:13:52.862 --> 1:13:54.517
I'm going to bring
some desserts in a few.

1:13:58.517 --> 1:13:59.724
You are so sexy.

1:13:59.758 --> 1:14:00.655
Look at you.

1:14:00.689 --> 1:14:02.172
You having fun?

1:14:02.206 --> 1:14:04.862
That's very interesting.

1:14:04.896 --> 1:14:06.793
I think you are
very interesting.

1:14:06.827 --> 1:14:07.758
We should stop.

1:14:07.793 --> 1:14:09.172
They're gonna come back.

1:14:09.206 --> 1:14:10.379
Oh, no.

1:14:10.413 --> 1:14:13.551
Heaven forbid somebody finds
out you actually like me.

1:14:33.103 --> 1:14:34.103
You mind if we join you?

1:14:51.068 --> 1:14:53.689
Will you stop?

1:14:53.724 --> 1:14:54.620
Sasha.

1:14:54.655 --> 1:14:55.655
Sasha.

1:14:55.689 --> 1:14:56.896
Look, hey, will you just wait.

1:14:56.931 --> 1:14:58.034
Don't touch me.

1:14:58.068 --> 1:14:59.758
OK, at least let
me take you home.

1:14:59.793 --> 1:15:02.068
You set me up, Lance.

1:15:02.103 --> 1:15:03.103
Baby, I'm sorry.

1:15:03.137 --> 1:15:04.310
I thought you'd like it.

1:15:04.344 --> 1:15:06.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:15:06.034 --> 1:15:07.172
Look, Sasha.

1:15:07.206 --> 1:15:09.896
Look, it's my fault, OK?

1:15:09.931 --> 1:15:11.344
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

1:15:11.379 --> 1:15:13.241
I'm tired of losing
women in my life

1:15:13.275 --> 1:15:16.068
because they don't
know what they want.

1:15:16.103 --> 1:15:17.724
And I know you want me.

1:15:17.758 --> 1:15:19.241
I don't want you.

1:15:19.275 --> 1:15:21.620
I don't want you,
Lance, I don't.

1:15:21.655 --> 1:15:24.172
Stop trying to replace
your last girl with me.

1:15:24.206 --> 1:15:26.241
If you miss her that
much, go get her.

1:15:26.275 --> 1:15:28.724
Take her back to your
damn swinger parties.

1:15:28.758 --> 1:15:31.034
But let me work on my family.

1:15:31.068 --> 1:15:33.724
Look, Sasha, I broke that
off with her because she

1:15:33.758 --> 1:15:35.068
was my uncle's fiancee.

1:15:35.103 --> 1:15:37.068
Your-- your uncle's fiance?

1:15:37.103 --> 1:15:39.034
And that shit was just wrong.

1:15:39.068 --> 1:15:41.000
Wait, wait, wait,
your uncle's fiance?

1:15:41.034 --> 1:15:42.965
But this, this is the
only thing that's ever

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000
felt right in my entire life.

1:15:46.034 --> 1:15:47.103
Are you Sasha Curtis?

1:15:47.137 --> 1:15:49.586
Shut up, we're talking.

1:15:49.620 --> 1:15:50.241
Listen.

1:15:50.275 --> 1:15:52.103
Lance, you are sick.

1:15:52.137 --> 1:15:53.724
You need help.

1:15:53.758 --> 1:15:55.862
Look, Sasha, if you don'twant to go back in there, fine.

1:15:55.896 --> 1:15:58.000
But at least just talk to me.

1:15:58.034 --> 1:16:01.103
I will, and listen
very carefully.

1:16:01.137 --> 1:16:03.793
I don't want you.

1:16:03.827 --> 1:16:07.758
Lose my damn number.

1:16:07.793 --> 1:16:08.689
Look, Sasha.

1:16:20.068 --> 1:16:20.896
I gotta go.

1:16:20.931 --> 1:16:22.137
I gotta go.

1:16:22.172 --> 1:16:23.310
I know, I know, I know.

1:16:23.344 --> 1:16:25.275
But you already missed work.

1:16:25.310 --> 1:16:26.931
Just stay a little bit longer.

1:16:26.965 --> 1:16:28.310
Come on, Faren, I gotta--

1:16:28.344 --> 1:16:29.137
Yeah.

1:16:35.068 --> 1:16:39.379
Are you expecting somebody?

1:16:39.413 --> 1:16:42.344
[knocking]

1:16:46.413 --> 1:16:47.931
Shit, it's him.

1:16:47.965 --> 1:16:49.827
It's him who?

1:16:49.862 --> 1:16:50.689
How did he find me?

1:16:52.896 --> 1:16:53.689
Don't!

1:17:04.310 --> 1:17:05.448
How did you find me, Terrence?

1:17:09.758 --> 1:17:12.275
Is that any way to greet
your man after three years?

1:17:14.793 --> 1:17:17.793
Well, in case you haven't
noticed, I've moved on.

1:17:24.034 --> 1:17:27.275
We need to talk now.

1:17:43.137 --> 1:17:45.000
FAREN: Why are you
here, Terrence?

1:17:45.034 --> 1:17:46.137
TERRENCE: Huh?

1:17:46.172 --> 1:17:47.862
You got this dude
laid up up in here.

1:17:47.896 --> 1:17:49.000
FAREN: Don't yell at me.

1:17:49.034 --> 1:17:50.448
TERRENCE: Don't
tell me what to do.

1:17:50.482 --> 1:17:51.758
FAREN: How did you find me?
TERRENCE: How did I find you?

1:17:51.793 --> 1:17:53.068
Don't worry about
how I found you.

1:17:53.103 --> 1:17:56.379
FAREN: How did you
freaking find me!

1:17:56.413 --> 1:17:58.862
TERRENCE: Bitch, I'll
kill you and him.

1:17:58.896 --> 1:18:00.896
You think this is a game?

1:18:00.931 --> 1:18:03.103
[inaudible]

1:18:03.137 --> 1:18:04.310
FAREN: Don't come near me!

1:18:04.344 --> 1:18:05.310
TERRENCE: Your ass
about to settle down.

1:18:05.344 --> 1:18:07.000
Do you think this is a game?

1:18:07.034 --> 1:18:08.103
You got this motherfucker
up in here, you walking out

1:18:08.137 --> 1:18:09.103
here with your damn panties.

1:18:09.137 --> 1:18:10.103
FAREN: Are you done?

1:18:10.137 --> 1:18:11.931
TERRENCE: No, I'm not done.

1:18:11.965 --> 1:18:13.034
FAREN: Get out of my house.

1:18:13.068 --> 1:18:14.310
How dare you come into my house?

1:18:14.344 --> 1:18:15.793
- Let go of me, Terrence!
- You got some dude!

1:18:15.827 --> 1:18:16.655
You got some dude--

1:18:16.689 --> 1:18:17.931
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

1:18:17.965 --> 1:18:19.034
--up in the house?
Cry!

1:18:19.068 --> 1:18:20.241
- Let go of me!
- Cry, pretty girl!

1:18:20.275 --> 1:18:21.482
- I'm not gonna cry.
- I want you to cry.

1:18:21.517 --> 1:18:22.344
I'm not gonna give
you the satisfaction.

1:18:22.379 --> 1:18:23.034
Cry, pretty girl

1:18:23.068 --> 1:18:23.344
Don't!

1:18:40.103 --> 1:18:41.482
[glass shattering]

1:19:08.448 --> 1:19:10.241
You ever come near my
bitch again, I'll kill you.

1:19:10.275 --> 1:19:11.103
You hear me?

1:19:11.137 --> 1:19:12.068
Go to sleep!

1:19:12.103 --> 1:19:13.103
Terrence, let go of him!

1:19:13.137 --> 1:19:14.103
What?

1:19:14.137 --> 1:19:15.000
Bitch, you ain't gonna shoot.

1:19:15.034 --> 1:19:16.275
[gunshot]

1:19:16.310 --> 1:19:18.965
What the fuck!

1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:20.000
What?

1:19:20.034 --> 1:19:22.862
Bitch, you gonna shoot
at me over this fool?

1:19:22.896 --> 1:19:24.241
You disloyal bitch.

1:19:24.275 --> 1:19:26.241
The only thing you
did was piss me off.

1:19:26.275 --> 1:19:28.034
Three more seconds and
I'll bust another one.

1:19:28.068 --> 1:19:29.103
Faren, put the gun down!

1:19:29.137 --> 1:19:30.620
Yeah, Faren, put the gun down.

1:19:30.655 --> 1:19:31.379
[gunshot]

1:19:31.413 --> 1:19:32.586
What the--

1:19:32.620 --> 1:19:33.758
This--

1:19:33.793 --> 1:19:36.034
I'm not afraid of going to
prison for messing you up,

1:19:36.068 --> 1:19:37.103
Terrence!

1:19:37.137 --> 1:19:38.068
Get out!

1:19:38.103 --> 1:19:39.034
All right.

1:19:39.068 --> 1:19:39.862
OK.

1:19:44.137 --> 1:19:44.965
You know it's not over.

1:19:48.275 --> 1:19:49.862
I'll be back.

1:19:53.965 --> 1:19:56.206
Why the hell did you
even open the door?

1:19:56.241 --> 1:19:58.344
Look, I thought that he was
gonna leave when he saw you.

1:19:58.379 --> 1:19:59.517
Yo, what the fuck, man?

1:19:59.551 --> 1:20:02.000
Where the hell did
you get a gun from?

1:20:02.034 --> 1:20:03.206
Chill.

1:20:03.241 --> 1:20:04.241
You can't be in
violation of your parole.

1:20:04.275 --> 1:20:05.275
You could have killed somebody.

1:20:05.310 --> 1:20:06.517
And you know the
neighbors heard.

1:20:06.551 --> 1:20:07.241
I know.

1:20:07.275 --> 1:20:09.034
But it's a good thing I had it.

1:20:09.068 --> 1:20:10.896
He's freaking crazy.

1:20:10.931 --> 1:20:14.137
The cops are probably on
their way here right now, OK?

1:20:14.172 --> 1:20:18.000
You need to get a restraining
order out on old boy.

1:20:18.034 --> 1:20:20.034
Get his ass reported.

1:20:20.068 --> 1:20:22.379
You should, too.

1:20:22.413 --> 1:20:24.172
Look what he did to you.

1:20:24.206 --> 1:20:27.379
They can charge him
for assault, right?

1:20:27.413 --> 1:20:30.172
Are you out of your mind?

1:20:30.206 --> 1:20:32.103
I can't talk to the damn cops.

1:20:32.137 --> 1:20:34.241
I shouldn't even be here.

1:20:34.275 --> 1:20:36.517
I could get fired for this shit.

1:20:36.551 --> 1:20:37.517
Is that what you want, Faren?

1:20:37.551 --> 1:20:39.103
You want me to lose my job?

1:20:39.137 --> 1:20:40.034
No.

1:20:40.068 --> 1:20:40.862
Is that what you want?

1:20:40.896 --> 1:20:42.068
No.

1:20:42.103 --> 1:20:45.241
Hey, listen, we just need
to keep this quiet, all right?

1:20:45.275 --> 1:20:47.931
Nobody has to know about it.

1:20:47.965 --> 1:20:49.931
Just give me the gun.

1:20:49.965 --> 1:20:50.931
Faren, give me the gun.

1:20:50.965 --> 1:20:52.172
I swear to god I'll
violate you right now.

1:20:52.206 --> 1:20:53.586
Just give me the gun.

1:20:53.620 --> 1:20:54.413
How could you?

1:21:00.172 --> 1:21:01.310
Not my truck.
Not my truck.

1:21:01.344 --> 1:21:02.310
Not my truck.
Not my truck.

1:21:02.344 --> 1:21:06.344
Not my-- This mother--

1:21:26.068 --> 1:21:28.068
That looks good, baby.

1:21:28.103 --> 1:21:28.931
SASHA: Thanks.

1:21:50.068 --> 1:21:50.931
What's wrong, babe?

1:22:00.586 --> 1:22:03.241
Well, I think it's beautiful.

1:22:03.275 --> 1:22:05.275
No, it's broken.

1:22:05.310 --> 1:22:06.517
I can't fix it.

1:22:24.551 --> 1:22:28.241
You know, if this is how
it looks when it's broken,

1:22:28.275 --> 1:22:30.724
I can't imagine how good it
looks when it's all fixed up.

1:22:34.310 --> 1:22:36.344
What happened to your hand?

1:22:36.379 --> 1:22:37.241
Where's your ring?

1:22:37.275 --> 1:22:39.482
All right, so I was--

1:22:39.517 --> 1:22:41.620
starting up a game
of racquetball

1:22:41.655 --> 1:22:45.275
and I just left
the ring in my bag.

1:22:45.310 --> 1:22:46.517
The gym?

1:22:46.551 --> 1:22:48.241
When did you start
going back to the gym?

1:22:48.275 --> 1:22:51.275
That's not important, Sasha.

1:22:51.310 --> 1:22:54.137
You should just
know how beautiful

1:22:54.172 --> 1:22:59.068
I think you are, awesome
I think your jewelry is.

1:22:59.103 --> 1:23:00.793
I really think you're on
to something with this.

1:23:03.310 --> 1:23:04.137
Listen, I--

1:23:04.172 --> 1:23:06.724
Honey, I--

1:23:06.758 --> 1:23:07.689
You go.

1:23:11.241 --> 1:23:13.310
I know I haven't--

1:23:13.344 --> 1:23:16.068
Go ahead.

1:23:16.103 --> 1:23:19.758
--been present
emotionally lately and--

1:23:22.275 --> 1:23:23.448
and, uh--

1:23:23.482 --> 1:23:25.310
Honey, your job is
tough, I know that.

1:23:25.344 --> 1:23:26.724
I know.

1:23:26.758 --> 1:23:29.724
But there's no excuse for
the way I've been acting.

1:23:29.758 --> 1:23:31.172
You've been so
good to me, Sasha.

1:23:33.655 --> 1:23:36.310
I have to tell you something.

1:23:36.344 --> 1:23:37.137
OK.

1:23:41.413 --> 1:23:42.241
Just--

1:23:42.275 --> 1:23:43.103
I'll grab it.

1:23:43.137 --> 1:23:44.034
Answer it, yeah.

1:23:44.068 --> 1:23:44.655
I get it.

1:23:47.758 --> 1:23:50.172
Ah.

1:23:50.206 --> 1:23:51.241
This is Guy Curtis speaking.

1:23:51.275 --> 1:23:52.379
What's up?

1:23:52.413 --> 1:23:54.241
TERRENCE [ON PHONE]:
[laughs] Yeah, I

1:23:54.275 --> 1:23:56.517
know who the fuck this is.

1:23:56.551 --> 1:24:02.206
Um, yeah, is there
something I can help you with?

1:24:02.241 --> 1:24:04.379
TERRENCE [ON PHONE]: I think
you've helped yourself enough,

1:24:04.413 --> 1:24:05.689
don't you agree?

1:24:05.724 --> 1:24:07.724
Listen, since you decided
to redecorate my truck,

1:24:07.758 --> 1:24:09.413
why don't we just
call ourselves even?

1:24:09.448 --> 1:24:10.517
TERRENCE [ON PHONE]: You funny.

1:24:10.551 --> 1:24:11.862
Man, I don't know
who the hell it

1:24:11.896 --> 1:24:14.655
is you think you are,
but do you know who I am,

1:24:14.689 --> 1:24:16.241
who I'm connected to?

1:24:16.275 --> 1:24:18.724
I swear to god if you call
my cell phone one more time,

1:24:18.758 --> 1:24:20.206
I will jack your
record up so bad

1:24:20.241 --> 1:24:21.689
it'll be hard for you
to get a janitorial job

1:24:21.724 --> 1:24:22.655
at a middle school.

1:24:22.689 --> 1:24:23.689
Don't ever again call me.

1:24:35.275 --> 1:24:36.793
Hey, babe.

1:24:36.827 --> 1:24:37.620
It's work.

1:24:40.655 --> 1:24:43.551
What were you saying?

1:24:43.586 --> 1:24:45.241
Nothing.

1:24:45.275 --> 1:24:47.241
I'm probably just
stressing about the show.

1:24:47.275 --> 1:24:52.241
And I wanted to apologize
for taking it out on you.

1:24:52.275 --> 1:24:57.275
If you ever need anything,
Sasha, I'm still your man.

1:25:09.724 --> 1:25:17.758
And babe, um, I'm gonna
do better, I promise.

1:25:21.931 --> 1:25:22.758
Me too.

1:26:04.551 --> 1:26:05.655
You didn't answer your phone.

1:26:05.689 --> 1:26:06.655
What?

1:26:06.689 --> 1:26:09.241
I called you three times.

1:26:09.275 --> 1:26:11.000
Faren, how did
you get my address?

1:26:11.034 --> 1:26:12.551
You left something
at my place.

1:26:12.586 --> 1:26:14.551
And I thought that
you might need it

1:26:14.586 --> 1:26:17.000
to come home and play husband.

1:26:19.896 --> 1:26:23.931
Faren, how the hell did
you get my wedding ring?

1:26:23.965 --> 1:26:25.413
Don't you remember, silly?

1:26:25.448 --> 1:26:26.758
You gave it to me before--

1:26:26.793 --> 1:26:28.827
Well, you know.

1:26:31.724 --> 1:26:33.034
And you know, I would
have kept it, too,

1:26:33.068 --> 1:26:35.482
but it's a little
small for my taste.

1:26:35.517 --> 1:26:37.793
So when you get
me a ring, you'll

1:26:37.827 --> 1:26:39.034
have to do better than that.

1:26:39.068 --> 1:26:43.793
Listen, Faren, I don't
know what you think

1:26:43.827 --> 1:26:45.482
is going on here.

1:26:45.517 --> 1:26:50.655
But this thing, whatever
this thing is, it's over, OK?

1:26:50.689 --> 1:26:51.793
It ends now.

1:26:51.827 --> 1:26:52.862
It ends tonight.

1:26:52.896 --> 1:26:53.931
You don't mean that.

1:26:53.965 --> 1:26:54.448
No, no.

1:26:54.482 --> 1:26:55.655
Yes, I do mean it.

1:26:55.689 --> 1:26:57.482
OK, you're in front of my house.

1:26:57.517 --> 1:26:58.379
My family's in there.

1:26:58.413 --> 1:26:59.379
This isn't a good look.

1:26:59.413 --> 1:27:00.517
It's not sexy.

1:27:00.551 --> 1:27:01.724
So what?

1:27:01.758 --> 1:27:02.724
You just promise me
the world, fuck me,

1:27:02.758 --> 1:27:04.068
and then send me on my way?

1:27:04.103 --> 1:27:04.793
You're a bitch.

1:27:04.827 --> 1:27:06.551
Will you keep your voice down?

1:27:06.586 --> 1:27:07.896
What if Sasha woke?

1:27:07.931 --> 1:27:10.620
Oh, I wonder what she
would think about this?

1:27:10.655 --> 1:27:12.068
Let's see.

1:27:12.103 --> 1:27:12.896
Listen to me.

1:27:18.551 --> 1:27:22.551
Listen to me, I will put a
parole violation on you faster

1:27:22.586 --> 1:27:23.586
than you can spin your head.

1:27:23.620 --> 1:27:24.724
I'm not messing with you, Faren.

1:27:24.758 --> 1:27:28.310
I'm dead-- dead serious.

1:27:28.344 --> 1:27:30.034
You're on my block
in front of my house.

1:27:30.068 --> 1:27:36.000
Now, you will report to
your new PO next week.

1:27:36.034 --> 1:27:39.586
Get the hell off my property.

1:27:39.620 --> 1:27:41.517
Really?

1:27:41.551 --> 1:27:43.310
Really.

1:27:43.344 --> 1:27:48.068
I wonder what your boss would
think about my reassignment.

1:27:48.103 --> 1:27:49.482
I bet you she'd
want to know why.

1:28:23.172 --> 1:28:24.827
Babe, you want to
turn out the light?

1:28:32.620 --> 1:28:33.827
Sweetie?
- Yeah.

1:28:33.862 --> 1:28:34.862
Yeah, I got it.

1:28:40.689 --> 1:28:42.103
Hey, sweetie.

1:28:42.137 --> 1:28:43.551
I got some sunglasses
in the car?

1:28:43.586 --> 1:28:44.689
Probably.

1:28:44.724 --> 1:28:46.379
Hey, listen, thanks
for the ride.

1:28:46.413 --> 1:28:48.068
And do you want me
to pick you up, too?

1:28:48.103 --> 1:28:51.379
No, like I said, the only slot
the mechanic had was 10:00 AM,

1:28:51.413 --> 1:28:53.793
so I just let him
go ahead and tow it.

1:28:53.827 --> 1:28:55.068
I'll get Kev to
bring me back home.

1:28:55.103 --> 1:28:56.517
It's not like that, babe.

1:28:56.551 --> 1:28:57.965
But, like, a wheel
alignment needs a tow?

1:29:05.103 --> 1:29:06.068
GUY: You got the keys.

1:29:15.551 --> 1:29:16.517
All right, bye-bye.

1:29:16.551 --> 1:29:17.655
- OK.
- Love you.

1:29:17.689 --> 1:29:18.620
Have a good day now.

1:29:18.655 --> 1:29:21.103
You have a good day, too.

1:29:21.137 --> 1:29:23.931
And tell your team, I can't
wait to see them on Saturday.

1:29:27.551 --> 1:29:28.827
That's right.

1:29:28.862 --> 1:29:31.034
They can't wait
to see you either.

1:29:31.068 --> 1:29:32.827
You got something on your hair.

1:29:32.862 --> 1:29:34.000
Good morning, Mr. Curtis.

1:29:39.896 --> 1:29:42.000
Faren, Ms. Wilson,
you're early.

1:29:42.034 --> 1:29:43.000
What are you doing here?

1:29:43.034 --> 1:29:46.000
And you must be Mrs. Curtis.

1:29:46.034 --> 1:29:49.448
You're even more beautiful
than Guy described.

1:29:49.482 --> 1:29:50.931
Well, thanks.

1:29:50.965 --> 1:29:52.689
So are you going to be
coming to the party?

1:29:52.724 --> 1:29:54.689
No.

1:29:54.724 --> 1:29:56.068
She's a client who
I'm just trying

1:29:56.103 --> 1:29:57.896
to help out a little bit.

1:29:57.931 --> 1:30:00.862
Actually, she's a
little bit crazy.

1:30:00.896 --> 1:30:02.034
You see the look in her eye?

1:30:02.068 --> 1:30:03.655
A little bananas, right?

1:30:03.689 --> 1:30:04.655
But she's harmless.

1:30:04.689 --> 1:30:05.586
Is she looking right now?

1:30:05.620 --> 1:30:07.448
Yeah.

1:30:07.482 --> 1:30:10.137
You know, since
you're here early,

1:30:10.172 --> 1:30:12.586
why don't I take you upstairs
and get you processed, OK?

1:30:12.620 --> 1:30:13.655
Is that all right?

1:30:13.689 --> 1:30:14.655
Baby, I love you.

1:30:14.689 --> 1:30:15.517
I love you.

1:30:15.551 --> 1:30:16.862
More than you know.

1:30:16.896 --> 1:30:18.103
All right.

1:30:18.137 --> 1:30:19.206
It was very nice to
meet you, Ms. Curtis.

1:30:19.241 --> 1:30:20.034
Have a good one.

1:30:24.517 --> 1:30:28.103
Faren, I'm
transferring your case.

1:30:28.137 --> 1:30:29.724
I can't deal with
any harassment.

1:30:29.758 --> 1:30:31.793
That was my wife, OK?

1:30:31.827 --> 1:30:33.620
I won't deal with this.

1:30:33.655 --> 1:30:34.827
He came back.

1:30:34.862 --> 1:30:37.517
When I got back, he
was waiting for me.

1:30:37.551 --> 1:30:39.517
And he said he could
smell you on me.

1:30:39.551 --> 1:30:40.689
Oh my god.

1:30:40.724 --> 1:30:42.586
And then he started tothreaten that he would kill me.

1:30:42.620 --> 1:30:45.448
Faren, Faren, listen, you
have to call the police.

1:30:45.482 --> 1:30:46.862
OK, but you have to
leave me out of it.

1:30:46.896 --> 1:30:48.413
There'll be way too
many questions asked.

1:30:50.896 --> 1:30:53.448
Faren, I have a wife.

1:30:53.482 --> 1:30:56.517
I have a child, OK?

1:30:56.551 --> 1:30:59.000
I love my wife.

1:30:59.034 --> 1:31:01.965
So you're just
gonna abandon me?

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:03.655
Is this the kind of
man that you are?

1:31:03.689 --> 1:31:05.103
Faren, I'm a married--

1:31:05.137 --> 1:31:06.103
I'm a married man.

1:31:06.137 --> 1:31:09.034
That's the kind of man I am.

1:31:09.068 --> 1:31:11.068
It was my fault, OK?

1:31:11.103 --> 1:31:12.241
I'm sorry I let this
get out of hand.

1:31:12.275 --> 1:31:13.896
It was my fault,
it wasn't yours.

1:31:13.931 --> 1:31:15.172
But you need to call the police.

1:31:15.206 --> 1:31:17.275
They can put a restraining
order on him, I can't.

1:31:17.310 --> 1:31:21.655
He'll get the message,
and he'll move on.

1:31:21.689 --> 1:31:23.034
Faren, you're sweet, OK?

1:31:23.068 --> 1:31:24.275
You're a sweet girl.

1:31:24.310 --> 1:31:26.034
But all this drama, you
showing up at my job?

1:31:26.068 --> 1:31:27.724
Shit is over.

1:31:27.758 --> 1:31:30.862
It's a rap.

1:31:30.896 --> 1:31:31.724
Do you understand me?

1:31:35.137 --> 1:31:37.241
Listen to me,
you pompous prick,

1:31:37.275 --> 1:31:39.275
you are not the first
married man I've dealt with,

1:31:39.310 --> 1:31:42.103
you're just the first one I
was stupid enough to fall for.

1:31:42.137 --> 1:31:44.620
So get off your high horse.

1:31:44.655 --> 1:31:48.793
You told me that as your paroleethat I was safe with you.

1:31:48.827 --> 1:31:50.275
Well, clearly,
that's not the case.

1:31:50.310 --> 1:31:52.172
So the only thing
that you can do for me

1:31:52.206 --> 1:31:55.758
is put in a request for anearly termination of my parole.

1:31:55.793 --> 1:31:59.241
And you might as well mail
me the highest recommendation

1:31:59.275 --> 1:32:01.241
so that I can find a damn job.

1:32:01.275 --> 1:32:02.724
You already know the address.

1:32:02.758 --> 1:32:04.724
Faren, will you keep
your damn voice down.

1:32:04.758 --> 1:32:05.620
It's not that easy.

1:32:05.655 --> 1:32:08.689
Man up, Guy.

1:32:08.724 --> 1:32:12.068
I suggest you pull a little
favor with your friend,

1:32:12.103 --> 1:32:14.931
Judge Pierce, was it?

1:32:14.965 --> 1:32:19.862
Because if you don't, you'renot gonna just lose a promotion,

1:32:19.896 --> 1:32:21.862
you're gonna lose a job.

1:32:21.896 --> 1:32:23.103
Do you know who's in there?

1:32:23.137 --> 1:32:25.689
No, I'm trying
to figure it out.

1:32:25.724 --> 1:32:27.034
What kind of hell
has gotten into him?

1:32:27.068 --> 1:32:29.586
He never gets this
worked up by parolees.

1:32:29.620 --> 1:32:31.310
I don't know.

1:32:31.344 --> 1:32:32.862
Maybe these parolees don't--

1:32:32.896 --> 1:32:34.827
I got work to do.

1:32:34.862 --> 1:32:35.793
FAREN: This is my life.

1:32:35.827 --> 1:32:36.862
And it's--

1:32:36.896 --> 1:32:38.000
Take this to my
office, please.

1:32:38.034 --> 1:32:39.000
FAREN: --very serious
to me, as well.

1:32:39.034 --> 1:32:40.275
Thank you.

1:32:40.310 --> 1:32:41.965
FAREN: So all you have to do
is do what I asked you to do.

1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:42.965
GUY: I'm sorry,
that's all I can say.

1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:43.827
That's all I can say to you.

1:32:43.862 --> 1:32:44.965
[inaudible]

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.103
FAREN: Sorry's not good enough.

1:32:46.137 --> 1:32:48.896
GUY: Let's just try
to talk this out.

1:32:48.931 --> 1:32:50.310
Mr. Curtis?

1:32:50.344 --> 1:32:53.137
Ms. Wilson, is
everything OK in here?

1:32:55.655 --> 1:32:56.241
No.

1:32:59.344 --> 1:33:02.379
Honestly speaking,
Mr. Curtis has

1:33:02.413 --> 1:33:04.655
been a complete asshole to me.

1:33:04.689 --> 1:33:06.241
And I was beginning
to think that he

1:33:06.275 --> 1:33:09.655
didn't even care if I wasgoing to get on my feet or not.

1:33:09.689 --> 1:33:11.793
But as it turns out,
that's just his tough love.

1:33:14.793 --> 1:33:19.758
And I'm sure I'll be exactly
where I need to be in no time.

1:33:19.793 --> 1:33:22.068
I see.

1:33:22.103 --> 1:33:23.034
That's good to know.

1:33:23.068 --> 1:33:24.034
Thank you, Ms. Wilson.

1:33:24.068 --> 1:33:24.896
Thank you.

1:33:30.241 --> 1:33:33.172
Glad to see you finally
got things under control.

1:33:33.206 --> 1:33:34.931
That's exactly how
you're supposed

1:33:34.965 --> 1:33:36.689
to treat those parolees.

1:33:36.724 --> 1:33:39.379
Let them bang their own damn
and ice their own bruises.

1:33:42.724 --> 1:33:45.172
Between you and
me, no way in hell

1:33:45.206 --> 1:33:48.000
did I want to give
Kevin that promotion.

1:33:48.034 --> 1:33:50.724
Way to go.

1:33:50.758 --> 1:33:51.793
Oh, and Guy.

1:33:51.827 --> 1:33:52.862
Yeah?

1:33:52.896 --> 1:33:54.862
Could you take
on any new cases

1:33:54.896 --> 1:33:57.034
between now and Wednesday?

1:33:57.068 --> 1:33:59.137
Now that you've gotten
things under control,

1:33:59.172 --> 1:34:03.068
I'm going to take
a few sick days.

1:34:03.103 --> 1:34:04.172
Good job.

1:34:28.793 --> 1:34:31.931
Damn, you look hot
when you're sweaty.

1:34:31.965 --> 1:34:33.931
Lance, what are
you doing here?

1:34:36.862 --> 1:34:38.103
If my husband was home--

1:34:38.137 --> 1:34:39.206
Home?

1:34:39.241 --> 1:34:42.724
Yeah, but he's
not though, is he?

1:34:42.758 --> 1:34:46.379
Look, I already told
you, you and I are done.

1:34:46.413 --> 1:34:48.241
That stunt you pulled
the other day--

1:34:48.275 --> 1:34:49.793
I brought you something.

1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.241
I figured you deserved to havea portrait hanging on your wall

1:34:59.275 --> 1:35:01.379
and thought that your
insecure-ass husband

1:35:01.413 --> 1:35:02.482
wouldn't even think to do it.

1:35:05.172 --> 1:35:08.241
Lance, this is
really beautiful.

1:35:08.275 --> 1:35:09.482
I should've done
this a long time ago.

1:35:12.034 --> 1:35:15.206
You have to promise me to nevercome to my house like this

1:35:15.241 --> 1:35:17.137
again.

1:35:17.172 --> 1:35:17.965
Take it.

1:35:21.379 --> 1:35:22.344
I'll do my best.

1:35:26.344 --> 1:35:29.827
You jog every day this time?

1:35:29.862 --> 1:35:31.206
That's good to know.

1:35:37.965 --> 1:35:39.172
Yo, Guy, wait up.

1:35:39.206 --> 1:35:40.034
Yeah.

1:35:40.068 --> 1:35:42.793
Hey, man, you OK?

1:35:42.827 --> 1:35:45.137
Yeah, just a crazy
workload, hellish.

1:35:45.172 --> 1:35:47.206
Well, you know, if
you need me to take care

1:35:47.241 --> 1:35:49.310
of Ms. Wilson for you,
I think I could make

1:35:49.344 --> 1:35:52.034
a little room in my schedule.

1:35:52.068 --> 1:35:53.310
She is so fine.

1:35:53.344 --> 1:35:55.000
And time out of work on
Saturday for that crime

1:35:55.034 --> 1:35:57.137
Saturday, Saturday,
Saturday, Kevin, Saturday.

1:35:57.172 --> 1:35:58.448
Yes?

1:35:58.482 --> 1:36:01.586
I almost forgot, my wife,
she's throwing a party.

1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:04.000
And I told her I would
invite my friends.

1:36:04.034 --> 1:36:06.000
You're my friend, so you
gotta go to the party.

1:36:06.034 --> 1:36:06.965
What kind of party?

1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:07.517
It's a party, Kevin.

1:36:07.551 --> 1:36:09.379
What kind of party?

1:36:09.413 --> 1:36:11.379
It's a jewelry party.

1:36:11.413 --> 1:36:12.862
A jewelry party?

1:36:12.896 --> 1:36:14.034
- Yeah, it's going to be fun.
- First off--

1:36:14.068 --> 1:36:15.000
You should buy the jewelry.

1:36:15.034 --> 1:36:15.931
No, second off, no way.

1:36:15.965 --> 1:36:16.586
Kevin, listen.

1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:17.862
Jewelry?

1:36:17.896 --> 1:36:19.896
It'll be free
food and free wine.

1:36:19.931 --> 1:36:21.137
And she has a lot
of hot friends.

1:36:21.172 --> 1:36:22.931
OK, I'm there for you.

1:36:22.965 --> 1:36:24.137
Yeah, you're a giver.

1:36:24.172 --> 1:36:26.379
All right, speaking of giving.

1:36:26.413 --> 1:36:27.379
Yes, my wife, she--

1:36:27.413 --> 1:36:28.379
Uh, I already heard.

1:36:28.413 --> 1:36:29.896
Your wife's got you recruiting.

1:36:29.931 --> 1:36:32.172
Look, if I go to one
more toy party, pyramid

1:36:32.206 --> 1:36:34.241
scheme, wrap party,
I don't know,

1:36:34.275 --> 1:36:35.551
I think I might just throw up.

1:36:35.586 --> 1:36:39.000
Elaine, if you come, you
have the whole day off.

1:36:39.034 --> 1:36:40.482
You can do that?

1:36:40.517 --> 1:36:43.241
When Iron Maiden's away,
I can do what I want.

1:36:43.275 --> 1:36:44.862
Deal.

1:36:44.896 --> 1:36:47.896
You know, wear something
appropriate like you usually

1:36:47.931 --> 1:36:49.068
do.

1:36:49.103 --> 1:36:52.896
Uh, say something appropriate
like you usually don't.

1:36:52.931 --> 1:36:53.931
I'll see you there, Guy.

1:36:56.206 --> 1:36:57.448
- She's good.
- Yeah.

1:36:57.482 --> 1:36:58.275
- I mean, that was sharp, right?- Yeah, I know.

1:36:58.310 --> 1:36:59.241
It was quick.

1:36:59.275 --> 1:37:00.413
It was right on.
- Bang.

1:37:00.448 --> 1:37:01.310
Boom, right in there.

1:37:01.344 --> 1:37:02.172
Yeah, no hesitation.

1:37:02.206 --> 1:37:03.034
Hey, listen.

1:37:03.068 --> 1:37:04.137
Yeah?

1:37:04.172 --> 1:37:05.172
You're coming out
with me tonight.

1:37:05.206 --> 1:37:07.172
Yes, you need to loosen up, man.

1:37:07.206 --> 1:37:08.551
My nephew is waiting outside.

1:37:08.586 --> 1:37:11.034
We're gonna go to the pool
hall, drink some beers,

1:37:11.068 --> 1:37:11.931
play some game.

1:37:11.965 --> 1:37:12.586
What do you say?

1:37:12.620 --> 1:37:13.310
You in?

1:37:13.344 --> 1:37:15.137
It'll be fun.

1:37:15.172 --> 1:37:16.068
I could use a drink.

1:37:16.103 --> 1:37:17.275
Good call.

1:37:17.310 --> 1:37:18.310
All right, that's
what I like to hear.

1:37:18.344 --> 1:37:19.931
Hey, man, I'mma see you later.

1:37:19.965 --> 1:37:21.172
All right.

1:37:21.206 --> 1:37:22.586
Kevin, what happened to that
case you roped in last week?

1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:23.482
Remember you were
telling me about that?

1:37:23.517 --> 1:37:24.310
Crazy Alfred, yeah.

1:37:24.344 --> 1:37:25.931
Alfred.

1:37:25.965 --> 1:37:27.172
The guy comes into my office
carrying a pocket knife.

1:37:27.206 --> 1:37:28.172
Are you serious?

1:37:28.206 --> 1:37:29.172
I go, what are you doing?

1:37:29.206 --> 1:37:31.034
He goes, it's my favorite knife.

1:37:31.068 --> 1:37:32.551
I go, man, you can't have that.

1:37:32.586 --> 1:37:34.586
I go, do you know that
I could violate you?

1:37:34.620 --> 1:37:37.172
Yo, yo, yo, there he is.

1:37:37.206 --> 1:37:39.206
On time as usual.

1:37:39.241 --> 1:37:40.620
- My bad I'm late.
- It's all right.

1:37:40.655 --> 1:37:41.344
No worries.

1:37:41.379 --> 1:37:43.655
So guy, this is my nephew Lance.

1:37:43.689 --> 1:37:47.103
Nephew Lance, what's
going on, brother?

1:37:47.137 --> 1:37:50.103
Kevin, I always told you you
were a light-skinned brother.

1:37:50.137 --> 1:37:51.689
But for real, your uncle
tells me you turned out

1:37:51.724 --> 1:37:53.413
to be quite the photographer.
- Ah, he's all right.

1:37:53.448 --> 1:37:55.586
Yeah, so is your cooking.

1:37:55.620 --> 1:37:58.103
You know, but between
acting and photography,

1:37:58.137 --> 1:37:59.517
something is bound to take off.

1:37:59.551 --> 1:38:00.689
Congrats, man.
Congrats.

1:38:00.724 --> 1:38:02.034
I'd love to see
some of your work

1:38:02.068 --> 1:38:03.310
some time whenever
you get a chance.

1:38:03.344 --> 1:38:05.034
I ju-- I just
printed these out.

1:38:05.068 --> 1:38:07.137
You know, every girl wants to bea model, but I think I found--

1:38:07.172 --> 1:38:08.724
- Wait till you see this stuff.- I think I found a winner.

1:38:08.758 --> 1:38:10.206
- Are you serious?
- Oh, man.

1:38:10.241 --> 1:38:11.379
Enjoy yourself.

1:38:11.413 --> 1:38:12.241
This for me?

1:38:12.275 --> 1:38:13.137
For you.

1:38:13.172 --> 1:38:15.758
There's one in there.

1:38:15.793 --> 1:38:17.551
It gets better.

1:38:17.586 --> 1:38:19.000
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Yeah.

1:38:19.034 --> 1:38:20.620
We're in the wrong
line of work, my friend.

1:38:20.655 --> 1:38:23.620
Now, this one down here, you
can't see the bottom of it,

1:38:23.655 --> 1:38:25.413
but there's a world of pleasure.

1:38:25.448 --> 1:38:26.379
I'll just put it like that.

1:38:26.413 --> 1:38:27.275
I bet.

1:38:27.310 --> 1:38:28.172
You know something, man?

1:38:28.206 --> 1:38:29.379
This is a good look.

1:38:29.413 --> 1:38:30.586
I mean, I'm just looking
at a few of them,

1:38:30.620 --> 1:38:32.448
you've got the eye.

1:38:32.482 --> 1:38:34.379
My wife wants to get
back into modeling, man.

1:38:34.413 --> 1:38:35.517
She's been bugging me about it.

1:38:35.551 --> 1:38:36.413
Maybe you can shoot
her some time.

1:38:36.448 --> 1:38:37.310
She's beautiful.

1:38:37.344 --> 1:38:39.413
5', 11, tall.

1:38:39.448 --> 1:38:41.103
I don't want to sound
like a creep or nothing,

1:38:41.137 --> 1:38:42.275
but my wife is beautiful.

1:38:42.310 --> 1:38:45.103
Wow, is she thick?

1:38:45.137 --> 1:38:46.344
What's that?

1:38:46.379 --> 1:38:47.620
Hey, man, all right,
as much fun as this

1:38:47.655 --> 1:38:51.034
is looking at exquisite, let's
say we get to the pool hall

1:38:51.068 --> 1:38:53.310
so I can take some of your
money, kick your asses.

1:38:53.344 --> 1:38:54.551
In the car, all right?

1:38:54.586 --> 1:38:56.068
He hasn't beat me
since he had hair.

1:38:56.103 --> 1:38:57.482
He knows I'm gonna have
no problem believing that.

1:38:57.517 --> 1:38:58.586
- Here we go.
- Yeah, here we go.

1:38:58.620 --> 1:39:00.103
Going after my seat again?

1:39:00.137 --> 1:39:01.827
Man, listen, it's not
my fault you're 5', 7".

1:39:01.862 --> 1:39:02.620
Ouch.

1:39:19.241 --> 1:39:20.172
Hey, babe, where you been?

1:39:20.206 --> 1:39:22.172
Hey, sweetie.

1:39:22.206 --> 1:39:28.448
Well, I was with Kevin
for a guys night.

1:39:28.482 --> 1:39:29.551
Bananas.

1:39:29.586 --> 1:39:31.793
Good, good for him.

1:39:31.827 --> 1:39:33.620
How's it been since the breakup?

1:39:33.655 --> 1:39:36.482
I know you said it
hit him pretty hard.

1:39:36.517 --> 1:39:39.034
Yeah, no, he seems to
be doing a lot better.

1:39:39.068 --> 1:39:40.620
Yeah, Kevin just needs
to find something

1:39:40.655 --> 1:39:42.172
he's passionate
about, he'll be good.

1:39:42.206 --> 1:39:44.551
Yeah

1:39:44.586 --> 1:39:45.586
Speaking of which--

1:39:49.068 --> 1:39:50.241
modeling.

1:39:50.275 --> 1:39:55.586
I've been thinking, I know
how important it is to you.

1:39:55.620 --> 1:39:59.551
So I'll be cool if you
took a few shots, as long

1:39:59.586 --> 1:40:03.275
as they're not too racy, Sasha.

1:40:03.310 --> 1:40:05.482
Wow.

1:40:05.517 --> 1:40:07.172
I'm trying.

1:40:07.206 --> 1:40:08.034
Where'd that come from?

1:40:12.758 --> 1:40:15.068
I just never want to get
in the way of your happiness.

1:40:17.827 --> 1:40:20.344
And I know it
means a lot to you.

1:40:20.379 --> 1:40:21.482
I even know a
photographer you might

1:40:21.517 --> 1:40:23.172
like, a real talented dude.

1:40:23.206 --> 1:40:24.275
You want something to drink?

1:40:24.310 --> 1:40:25.137
Yes, please.

1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:31.137
Oh, babe, I almost forgot.

1:40:56.068 --> 1:40:56.758
Everything OK?

1:40:56.793 --> 1:40:57.586
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

1:40:57.620 --> 1:40:58.896
Everything is good.

1:40:58.931 --> 1:41:04.275
It's just, um, photos from thiscrazy, crazy case I'm working.

1:41:04.310 --> 1:41:05.206
Apple juice, right?

1:41:05.241 --> 1:41:05.862
Got it.

1:41:19.310 --> 1:41:20.275
Oh, Tai.

1:41:20.310 --> 1:41:22.586
Thank god bless you.

1:41:22.620 --> 1:41:23.793
See, I just know my girl.

1:41:23.827 --> 1:41:25.551
Now, if you really
want to bless me,

1:41:25.586 --> 1:41:27.448
you could come up
off this $40 that I

1:41:27.482 --> 1:41:28.517
just spent to feed your guests.

1:41:28.551 --> 1:41:29.793
You want $40
for real for that?

1:41:29.827 --> 1:41:31.137
Uh-huh.

1:41:31.172 --> 1:41:32.379
Hey, girl.

1:41:32.413 --> 1:41:34.310
Sasha.

1:41:34.344 --> 1:41:36.793
It looks beautiful.

1:41:36.827 --> 1:41:38.793
Tell me, what
can I do to help?

1:41:38.827 --> 1:41:39.551
Nothing.

1:41:39.586 --> 1:41:40.551
Go enjoy yourself.

1:41:49.344 --> 1:41:50.517
Hey, Elaine.

1:41:50.551 --> 1:41:52.689
Oh, hey, Guy.

1:41:52.724 --> 1:41:54.758
This is my fiancee Felipe.

1:41:54.793 --> 1:41:57.413
Oh, fiancee, I
didn't even realize.

1:41:57.448 --> 1:41:58.379
You never asked.

1:41:58.413 --> 1:41:59.379
Felipe, it's a pleasure.

1:41:59.413 --> 1:42:01.724
The pleasure is all mine.

1:42:01.758 --> 1:42:02.965
Sasha, sweetheart?

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:03.827
Sasha?

1:42:03.862 --> 1:42:05.517
Yeah?

1:42:05.551 --> 1:42:07.620
Hey, this is--

1:42:07.655 --> 1:42:09.172
sweetheart?

1:42:09.206 --> 1:42:12.310
This is Elaine, the awesome
administrative assistant

1:42:12.344 --> 1:42:13.551
I was telling you about.

1:42:13.586 --> 1:42:16.448
Elaine, this is my
wife Sasha and Felipe.

1:42:16.482 --> 1:42:18.724
Very nice to meet you.

1:42:18.758 --> 1:42:20.827
I've heard so much.

1:42:20.862 --> 1:42:22.965
Oh, and your jewelry
is astonishing.

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:23.689
Mm.

1:42:23.724 --> 1:42:24.655
Thank you.

1:42:24.689 --> 1:42:26.586
Elaine, right?

1:42:26.620 --> 1:42:29.172
Yes, Elaine.

1:42:29.206 --> 1:42:32.586
Guy has told me
so much about you.

1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:33.862
Obviously not enough.

1:42:37.827 --> 1:42:39.620
Have you had any
good food lately?

1:42:42.344 --> 1:42:43.758
So this is crystal.

1:42:43.793 --> 1:42:45.448
Hello, beautiful.

1:42:45.482 --> 1:42:47.482
Oh.

1:42:47.517 --> 1:42:48.482
How are you?

1:42:48.517 --> 1:42:49.344
I'm good.

1:42:49.379 --> 1:42:50.827
Wow, look at you.

1:42:50.862 --> 1:42:51.551
Yes.

1:42:51.586 --> 1:42:52.448
I brought beer.

1:42:52.482 --> 1:42:53.689
Don't worry, it's light.

1:42:53.724 --> 1:42:58.586
And this is my nephew Lance.

1:42:58.620 --> 1:43:02.758
Now, listen, now, you might be
able to suck some serious cash

1:43:02.793 --> 1:43:03.896
out of this guy.

1:43:03.931 --> 1:43:05.517
Because he's talking
about getting

1:43:05.551 --> 1:43:07.931
a little something for somebodyspecial, isn't that right?

1:43:07.965 --> 1:43:09.379
Yeah.

1:43:09.413 --> 1:43:10.275
I'm gonna say hi to Guy.

1:43:10.310 --> 1:43:10.931
All right.

1:43:13.862 --> 1:43:17.931
Lance, you need to leave now.

1:43:17.965 --> 1:43:19.344
What?

1:43:19.379 --> 1:43:20.517
Just leave.

1:43:20.551 --> 1:43:21.517
Is he here?

1:43:21.551 --> 1:43:22.620
Lance.

1:43:22.655 --> 1:43:23.586
What?

1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:24.551
What are you doing here?

1:43:24.586 --> 1:43:26.448
I came to get jewelry.

1:43:26.482 --> 1:43:27.310
It's not funny.

1:43:27.344 --> 1:43:28.000
My husband is here.

1:43:28.034 --> 1:43:28.724
Lance!

1:43:28.758 --> 1:43:32.586
Ah, so glad you made it, man.

1:43:32.620 --> 1:43:33.620
Absolutely.

1:43:33.655 --> 1:43:34.827
Sweetheart, this is Mr. Lance.

1:43:34.862 --> 1:43:37.586
He's a very, very
talented photographer.

1:43:37.620 --> 1:43:40.000
Hey, Uber.

1:43:40.034 --> 1:43:41.931
I see you know, Tai,
but everybody knows Tai.

1:43:41.965 --> 1:43:44.793
I don't, but I'd like to.

1:43:44.827 --> 1:43:48.379
Oh, I know him because he
drives me around sometimes.

1:43:48.413 --> 1:43:49.448
You know my ass is lazy.

1:43:49.482 --> 1:43:50.310
Hey.

1:43:50.344 --> 1:43:51.655
How are you?

1:43:51.689 --> 1:43:52.586
She's funny.

1:43:52.620 --> 1:43:54.551
So did you guys meet?

1:43:54.586 --> 1:43:55.655
Just now.

1:43:55.689 --> 1:43:57.620
Yeah, it was an
absolute pleasure.

1:43:57.655 --> 1:43:58.862
Fantastic.

1:43:58.896 --> 1:43:59.965
I'm gonna get a drink
for you, all right?

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:01.379
- No, baby, stay.
- No, no, no.

1:44:01.413 --> 1:44:02.068
I'll be right back.

1:44:02.103 --> 1:44:02.896
OK.

1:44:05.482 --> 1:44:07.448
So that's your husband?

1:44:07.482 --> 1:44:09.448
I think you can do better.

1:44:09.482 --> 1:44:10.862
Lance, leave, please.

1:44:10.896 --> 1:44:15.862
I will, when I'm ready.

1:44:15.896 --> 1:44:16.896
It's a great party.

1:44:21.068 --> 1:44:26.965
To my wife and the great
love of my life who manages

1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:28.862
to make her pieces on
the outside as beautiful

1:44:28.896 --> 1:44:29.965
as she is on the inside.

1:44:32.689 --> 1:44:34.068
To Sasha.

1:44:34.103 --> 1:44:35.551
ALL: To Sasha.

1:44:35.586 --> 1:44:36.551
To Sasha's beautiful insides.

1:44:39.482 --> 1:44:40.724
Aren't they great?

1:44:40.758 --> 1:44:41.965
ALL: Yeah.

1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:43.896
Mm, it tastes so good.

1:44:47.724 --> 1:44:48.724
It's so good.

1:44:48.758 --> 1:44:49.586
She made it.

1:44:49.620 --> 1:44:50.724
I know.

1:44:50.758 --> 1:44:52.034
So what do you do, Tai?

1:44:52.068 --> 1:44:54.517
Oh, well, actually
I write a sex blog.

1:44:54.551 --> 1:44:57.896
It's called "Ready or not,
I'm still gonna come."

1:44:57.931 --> 1:45:00.448
Oh my god, you're Tasty Tai.

1:45:00.482 --> 1:45:01.482
Yes.

1:45:01.517 --> 1:45:03.000
Dayton, that's right, OK.

1:45:03.034 --> 1:45:05.448
I have a girlfriend
who's from Dayton.

1:45:05.482 --> 1:45:06.103
Oh, hey, Guy.

1:45:06.137 --> 1:45:08.413
Thanks so much for coming.

1:45:08.448 --> 1:45:09.000
Just a minute.

1:45:09.034 --> 1:45:10.620
Hey, yeah, of course.

1:45:10.655 --> 1:45:12.758
Oh, Guy, Guy, come here.

1:45:12.793 --> 1:45:15.000
Your friend Terrence?

1:45:15.034 --> 1:45:18.068
Yes, Terrence is here.

1:45:18.103 --> 1:45:20.517
Guy.

1:45:20.551 --> 1:45:24.413
How you doing, old friend?

1:45:24.448 --> 1:45:26.379
Good.

1:45:26.413 --> 1:45:27.931
Good.

1:45:27.965 --> 1:45:29.551
You know your wife
was just telling me how

1:45:29.586 --> 1:45:31.896
you financed her jewelry line.

1:45:31.931 --> 1:45:34.551
You know, I just love
seeing faithful couples

1:45:34.586 --> 1:45:40.068
who really and truly love eachother, you know, the real deal.

1:45:40.103 --> 1:45:46.000
And besides, you have
a very beautiful wife.

1:45:46.034 --> 1:45:49.034
I see why you keep
her hidden away.

1:45:49.068 --> 1:45:52.000
Thank you, Terrence,
that's sweet of you.

1:45:52.034 --> 1:45:54.379
So how do you and
Guy know each other?

1:45:54.413 --> 1:45:55.965
Oh, babe, we barely
even know each other.

1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.655
Well, we do have a
very close mutual friend.

1:45:58.689 --> 1:46:01.137
You know how that is.

1:46:01.172 --> 1:46:03.965
OK.

1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.206
Sweetie, do you mind if
Terrence and I catch up?

1:46:06.241 --> 1:46:07.103
Of course not.

1:46:07.137 --> 1:46:09.000
It's a pleasure
meeting you, Terrence.

1:46:09.034 --> 1:46:11.655
Yo, I give hugs.

1:46:11.689 --> 1:46:13.896
And the pleasure is all mine.

1:46:22.137 --> 1:46:22.793
Feel it.

1:46:22.827 --> 1:46:25.000
It's like, got weight to it.

1:46:25.034 --> 1:46:27.724
So you guys browse,
shop, 30% off.

1:46:27.758 --> 1:46:28.586
Thank you.

1:46:28.620 --> 1:46:30.103
Enjoy.

1:46:30.137 --> 1:46:32.206
Oh.

1:46:32.241 --> 1:46:32.965
Excuse me.

1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.586
I was just going
to the bathroom.

1:46:35.620 --> 1:46:37.034
No worries, love.

1:46:37.068 --> 1:46:38.034
Maybe I should join you?

1:46:38.068 --> 1:46:40.931
No, no, I think I'm fine.

1:46:40.965 --> 1:46:42.551
Oh, you are definitely fine.

1:46:42.586 --> 1:46:46.551
But I thought we established
that the other evening.

1:46:46.586 --> 1:46:47.241
Make it back soon.

1:46:47.275 --> 1:46:48.172
We have much to talk about.

1:46:51.793 --> 1:46:54.000
You cannot make this shit up.

1:46:54.034 --> 1:46:56.655
I'm thoroughly enjoying
myself right now.

1:46:56.689 --> 1:46:58.034
The party has started.

1:46:58.068 --> 1:46:59.758
Girl, what is going
on with you and Uber?

1:46:59.793 --> 1:47:03.000
Tai, please, I promise I'll
tell you everything after.

1:47:03.034 --> 1:47:04.862
And who the hell is that?

1:47:04.896 --> 1:47:06.068
Yes, lord.

1:47:06.103 --> 1:47:07.827
Just some friend of Guy's.

1:47:07.862 --> 1:47:09.206
Can you just watch
things for me?

1:47:09.241 --> 1:47:10.137
I have to go to the restroom.
- OK, I'll watch.

1:47:10.172 --> 1:47:11.241
Just come right back, girl.

1:47:11.275 --> 1:47:12.068
OK.

1:47:14.620 --> 1:47:17.862
Pull it together.

1:47:17.896 --> 1:47:18.965
Pull it together.

1:47:33.931 --> 1:47:35.965
Hey.

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.965
Hey, don't.

1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:40.517
I bet he doesn't
touch you like that.

1:47:40.551 --> 1:47:41.655
Lance, stop.

1:47:41.689 --> 1:47:42.620
You smell good.

1:47:42.655 --> 1:47:43.275
Lance.

1:47:43.310 --> 1:47:44.827
[inaudible]

1:47:44.862 --> 1:47:45.689
Let go.

1:47:45.724 --> 1:47:47.172
I'm gonna scream.

1:47:47.206 --> 1:47:49.034
No.

1:47:49.068 --> 1:47:52.724
We both know that's not true.

1:47:52.758 --> 1:47:55.586
I haven't seen her.

1:47:55.620 --> 1:47:58.793
I'm trying to
reconcile with my wife.

1:47:58.827 --> 1:48:00.103
So Faren wasn't
with you yesterday?

1:48:00.137 --> 1:48:02.172
No, no, Faren wasn't
with me yesterday.

1:48:02.206 --> 1:48:03.724
She's probably off
to her next victim.

1:48:07.206 --> 1:48:09.034
OK.

1:48:09.068 --> 1:48:12.793
But it still doesn't
put you in the clear.

1:48:12.827 --> 1:48:15.000
But you know, I should--

1:48:15.034 --> 1:48:17.000
I should get a chance
to sample that tight ass

1:48:17.034 --> 1:48:19.689
on that wife of yours.

1:48:19.724 --> 1:48:21.896
Let me not only make a
favor don't you think

1:48:21.931 --> 1:48:31.000
If you even think of going
near my wife, I will end you.

1:48:31.034 --> 1:48:32.724
You might just have to.

1:48:32.758 --> 1:48:36.241
I wonder what your wife
would think about all this?

1:48:36.275 --> 1:48:37.586
Hmm?

1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:38.896
Yeah, I know.

1:48:38.931 --> 1:48:43.896
She'll probably grab the littlegirl and divorce your punk ass.

1:48:43.931 --> 1:48:46.862
And you don't want that, do you?

1:48:46.896 --> 1:48:48.586
No.

1:48:48.620 --> 1:48:52.931
But the main question is, how
much would this little secret

1:48:52.965 --> 1:48:56.275
of ours be worth to you?

1:48:59.793 --> 1:49:01.241
Get your fucking hands off me.

1:49:01.275 --> 1:49:02.137
Do you understand?

1:49:02.172 --> 1:49:03.137
Or what?

1:49:03.172 --> 1:49:04.137
Or I'll scream.

1:49:04.172 --> 1:49:05.931
No, you won't.

1:49:05.965 --> 1:49:07.379
No, you won't.

1:49:07.413 --> 1:49:09.896
No way you'll let your little
dirty little secret out,

1:49:09.931 --> 1:49:10.931
with all your friends here.

1:49:10.965 --> 1:49:11.758
No.

1:49:13.827 --> 1:49:15.655
You wouldn't do that.

1:49:15.689 --> 1:49:18.206
Did you forget that
my husband is a PO?

1:49:18.241 --> 1:49:22.689
He knows every cop and
every judge in the city.

1:49:22.724 --> 1:49:25.931
And do you know what
they do to rapists?

1:49:25.965 --> 1:49:27.655
Rape?

1:49:27.689 --> 1:49:31.034
Oh, is that-- is
that what this was?

1:49:31.068 --> 1:49:36.931
How about I tell
Mr. PO everything.

1:49:36.965 --> 1:49:39.793
I wish you would because
this guilt is killing me.

1:49:45.034 --> 1:49:46.758
How much?

1:49:46.793 --> 1:49:47.344
Give me a number.

1:49:50.344 --> 1:49:52.172
So you're not going to
introduce me to your friend?

1:49:52.206 --> 1:49:54.137
I'm not going to to introduce
you, Tai, absolutely not.

1:49:54.172 --> 1:49:56.413
Some people don't
have no damn manners.

1:49:56.448 --> 1:49:57.689
Tai, is it?

1:49:57.724 --> 1:49:58.931
Mm-hmm.

1:49:58.965 --> 1:50:00.793
Is that short for something?

1:50:00.827 --> 1:50:02.965
Just Tai.

1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.827
I'm sorry, how do you know Guy?

1:50:07.275 --> 1:50:08.310
How do I know Guy?

1:50:08.344 --> 1:50:11.103
Well, you know, Guy tried to--

1:50:11.137 --> 1:50:14.413
he tried to steal my bitch.

1:50:14.448 --> 1:50:20.137
[laughs] OK, y'all
real funny, you

1:50:20.172 --> 1:50:21.931
and your little parolee friend.

1:50:21.965 --> 1:50:24.068
Lance, I'm sorry.

1:50:24.103 --> 1:50:26.793
Whatever I did to
you, I'm sorry, OK?

1:50:26.827 --> 1:50:27.655
But it's over.

1:50:27.689 --> 1:50:28.241
No!

1:50:35.724 --> 1:50:42.172
After everything that we've
shared together, after all

1:50:42.206 --> 1:50:44.655
the things we've done.

1:50:44.689 --> 1:50:45.241
No.

1:50:52.068 --> 1:50:54.862
You can't get rid
of me that easily.

1:50:54.896 --> 1:50:56.137
OK, OK, OK.

1:50:56.172 --> 1:50:57.034
OK, baby, OK.

1:50:57.068 --> 1:50:58.344
OK.

1:50:58.379 --> 1:50:59.172
OK.

1:51:00.931 --> 1:51:06.000
How about, Lance, how
about we just share

1:51:06.034 --> 1:51:09.172
this whole thing to your uncle?

1:51:13.379 --> 1:51:15.241
Or does Kevin already
know that you were the one

1:51:15.275 --> 1:51:17.413
who was fucking his fiance?

1:51:21.068 --> 1:51:22.758
It seems like we
both have secrets.
