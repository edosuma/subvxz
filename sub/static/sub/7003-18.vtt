WEBVTT

00:02.768 --> 00:04.435
And don't over-tighten it.

00:04.436 --> 00:06.437
Change oil every 3,000 miles,

00:06.438 --> 00:09.140
Your engine will last
practically forever.

00:09.141 --> 00:11.142
All right, al,
let's get cleaned up.

00:11.143 --> 00:12.844
Now, when we're cleaning up,

00:12.845 --> 00:15.847
You wanna treat your tools
like a member of your family.

00:15.848 --> 00:19.350
That's right.
Al even invites his tools
over for thanksgiving.

00:20.987 --> 00:23.221
Even his hammer-in-law.

00:25.224 --> 00:27.792
My point is,
when you have a greasy tool,

00:27.793 --> 00:30.862
It's best to clean it up
with binford's super solvent.

00:30.863 --> 00:33.364
I might also add
that this same solvent

00:33.365 --> 00:35.533
Can clean engine parts
when soaked overnight.

00:35.534 --> 00:36.701
Overnight?

00:36.702 --> 00:39.104
What happens if you have
that 2am hankering

00:39.105 --> 00:41.840
To rebuild your motor?

00:41.841 --> 00:45.010
Then you would wanna call
1-800-cuckoo.

00:47.146 --> 00:50.214
Al has that number
on his speed dialer.

00:50.215 --> 00:52.216
The point
I'm trying to make is,

00:52.217 --> 00:54.218
To get the real gunk
off engine parts,

00:54.219 --> 00:57.155
I've come up
with a new concoction.

00:57.156 --> 00:59.390
You dip it
in this stuff, boy...

00:59.391 --> 01:01.726
Whew. Stand back.

01:01.727 --> 01:02.961
Whew! Boy.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.962
Dip those engine parts
in there,

01:04.964 --> 01:07.565
They'll be so clean
you can see yourself in 'em.

01:07.566 --> 01:10.935
In al's case, that's not
a real good idea, though.

01:10.936 --> 01:12.436
Dirty piston?

01:12.437 --> 01:15.173
A thing of the past
in tim taylor's
super-duper solvent.

01:15.174 --> 01:16.641
It's high-energy.

01:16.642 --> 01:18.710
<i>(hissing)</i>

01:26.418 --> 01:30.321
That's 1-800-c-u-c-k-o-o.

01:32.324 --> 01:33.992
Before we sign off,

01:33.993 --> 01:36.227
I'd like to tell you
a little bit

01:36.228 --> 01:38.063
About some upcoming shows.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.065
Former president jimmy carter's
favorite organization,

01:40.066 --> 01:42.333
Habitat for humanity,
will be here in detroit,

01:42.334 --> 01:44.335
And al and I
will be helping 'em build.

01:44.336 --> 01:46.938
Habitat works
with needy families
and volunteers

01:46.939 --> 01:49.440
Who get together
and build affordable homes.

01:49.441 --> 01:53.078
They offer a hand up,
not a handout.
Very well said, al.

01:53.079 --> 01:56.214
For this
special habitat project,
in association with the nfl,

01:56.215 --> 01:58.717
We'll be providing
some celebrity volunteers -

01:58.718 --> 02:00.551
Some of the detroit lions,

02:00.552 --> 02:02.887
From the denver broncos,
john elway,

02:02.888 --> 02:05.724
And the heavyweight
champion of the world,
evander holyfield -

02:05.725 --> 02:07.225
Working with me,

02:07.226 --> 02:10.195
And alongside us
will be common folk
like al and his friends.

02:13.398 --> 02:16.500
Tim and I
will both be in charge
of building a house,

02:16.501 --> 02:19.503
And we're going to do this
in only three days.

02:19.504 --> 02:21.039
<i>(scoffs)</i> three days.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.541
I'll build my house
in one day.

02:23.542 --> 02:27.278
That's including lunch, a nap
and two hours in a porta-potty.

02:32.317 --> 02:34.819
It's not
a competition, tim.
Really?

02:34.820 --> 02:37.321
I bet you can't even
get near a porta-potty

02:37.322 --> 02:39.290
After I've been in there
two hours.

03:31.944 --> 03:34.045
Hey, randy...

03:34.046 --> 03:35.980
Check this out.

03:37.683 --> 03:39.583
Looks like real gold.

03:39.584 --> 03:41.853
Yeah. I found it
in the alley.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.855
Ashley's birthday's
on Friday.

03:43.856 --> 03:46.390
I was gonna get her
a new bike reflector,

03:46.391 --> 03:48.526
But I think this
is even better.

03:48.527 --> 03:50.661
You think?

03:53.532 --> 03:55.033
Oh, here comes mom.

03:55.034 --> 03:57.635
Don't tell her
about the locket.

03:57.636 --> 04:01.206
Hi, brad.
Oh. Hi, mom.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.841
Bye, mom.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.175
Hey, randy.
Hey, dad.

04:04.176 --> 04:06.311
Hi, honey.

04:08.580 --> 04:12.016
Well, got dinner.
Barbecue from bits-o-pig.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.255
Great, great.

04:17.255 --> 04:20.257
Hey, uh, marie and I
watched your show today.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.759
Why?

04:21.760 --> 04:23.694
There was nothing else
good on.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.832
You didn't tell me
that you were involved

04:27.833 --> 04:29.901
In building those houses
for habitat.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.669
Didn't I mention it?

04:31.670 --> 04:33.838
No, you didn't.
I'd really like to help.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.241
That's why
I didn't mention it.

04:36.242 --> 04:39.244
It'd be fun. The two of us
could work together
on the same team.

04:39.245 --> 04:42.313
I don't really think
that's a good idea.
Why not?

04:42.314 --> 04:46.784
Well, I read somewhere
that husbands and wives
shouldn't work together.

04:46.785 --> 04:48.920
Where did you read that?

04:48.921 --> 04:52.590
<i>Husbands and wives</i>
<i>shouldn't work together</i>
<i>illustrated.</i>

04:52.591 --> 04:54.592
We get it down at work.

04:54.593 --> 04:58.162
Hmm... I wonder
what they'd say about that

04:58.163 --> 05:00.365
In that magazine
that I get -

05:00.366 --> 05:02.700
<i>Married to an idiot</i>
<i>monthly.</i>

05:04.370 --> 05:07.471
Jill, under normal circumstances
I'd love to have you with me,

05:07.472 --> 05:09.874
But this is construction.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.210
You just don't want a woman
on your team, is that it?

05:12.211 --> 05:16.281
No. This is lifting,
loading, shoveling...

05:16.282 --> 05:19.117
For that, you need
testosterone-pumping

05:19.118 --> 05:21.519
Muscle-churning,
bone-crushing male power.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.954
Arr-arr-arr-arr-arr.

05:24.723 --> 05:26.690
Ow.

05:33.498 --> 05:35.499
Hi. Tim "the tool man" taylor
here.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.501
You all know my assistant
al borland.

05:37.502 --> 05:40.604
We're here on location
at a habitat for humanity
job site.

05:40.605 --> 05:42.773
Al's team and my team
will be building a house

05:42.774 --> 05:45.176
Similar to this one
that's already been started.

05:45.177 --> 05:48.012
That's right, tim,
although one of us
has stacked the deck.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.014
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:50.015 --> 05:52.683
Let's go down to the vacant lot
and meet the teams,

05:52.684 --> 05:54.618
Starting with
the winning one - mine.

05:56.855 --> 05:59.890
All right, let's meet
team taylor, shall we?

05:59.891 --> 06:01.892
John elway
from the denver broncos.

06:01.893 --> 06:05.229
Mile high guy, huh?
Good-looking man, too.

06:05.230 --> 06:07.398
Sean jones
from the houston oilers.
Ano...

06:07.399 --> 06:09.000
Another mile high guy.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.002
Looks good in cotton,
doesn't he?

06:11.003 --> 06:13.004
All right.
Bill pickel from the... Boy.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.006
Little help,
tool man?

06:15.007 --> 06:17.075
...New york jets.
All right. Ok.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.910
And then ken o'brien from...
Whoever
will take me, tim.

06:19.911 --> 06:21.745
Philadelphia eagles,
of course.

06:21.746 --> 06:23.747
Now, we also have
evander holyfield

06:23.748 --> 06:26.417
And kelvin pritchett
from the lions due here,

06:26.418 --> 06:28.419
But they're not here yet.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.422
I've been waiting
since 7:00 in the rain.
Where are those guys?

06:31.423 --> 06:33.924
Why don't you
tell holyfield
you're unhappy?

06:33.925 --> 06:35.426
Well, maybe I will.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.261
This could be
interesting, huh?

06:37.262 --> 06:39.597
You guys ready to get
some serious building done?

06:39.598 --> 06:41.299
<i>(all)</i> arr-arr-arr-arr-arr.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.502
Let's go take a look
at al's team, shall we?

06:44.503 --> 06:47.605
<i>(scoffs)</i> right.

06:47.606 --> 06:51.575
Well,
the first member of team al
I would like you to meet

06:51.576 --> 06:53.577
Is tim's wife jill.

06:53.578 --> 06:57.715
Hi. I'm very happy
to be out here working
for such a worthy cause.

06:57.716 --> 06:59.917
Next we have...

06:59.918 --> 07:02.487
The reigning miss america,
miss kimberly aiken.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.587
Hi.

07:03.588 --> 07:05.523
Welcome aboard.
Thanks.

07:05.524 --> 07:08.659
Hi, kimberly. Tim taylor.
Good to have you on.
Hello.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.629
You wearing that crown
under your hat there?

07:11.630 --> 07:15.033
Yeah, and I have
my evening gown on
under my overalls.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.901
Really...?

07:16.902 --> 07:18.903
This here is gwen number one.

07:18.904 --> 07:22.006
She's been working
on habitat houses
for what, ten years?

07:22.007 --> 07:26.411
And this is gwen number two.
She is a professional plumber.

07:26.412 --> 07:30.348
And denise here
is a master electrician.

07:30.349 --> 07:33.784
Isn't that just dandy?
This team can build a house.

07:33.785 --> 07:36.054
My team
can bench-press a house.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.524
Yeah, it'll make it
a lot easier
to dust under it.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.625
Well, you've met the teams.

07:41.626 --> 07:44.295
Now we start building,
so stay tuned.

07:47.832 --> 07:49.633
John, what are you doing?

07:49.634 --> 07:53.104
Having a little breakfast
while we look at the plan.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.273
Do I know you?
Eric hipple.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.275
Eric hipple.
Quarterback for the lions.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.544
Yeah. Didn't recognize you.
You're not flat on your back.

08:01.313 --> 08:04.148
All right, guys,
let's get to work.

08:04.149 --> 08:06.551
You're the tool man.
What do you want us
to do first?

08:06.552 --> 08:08.386
We're gonna build
the walls

08:08.387 --> 08:10.888
And then put 'em all up
together, same time.

08:10.889 --> 08:13.558
It says here we should
put these walls up
as we build 'em.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.560
Yeah. That way
we know if it fits.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.296
Eric's right, tim.
I think we should
stick to the plans.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.131
<i>(sighs)</i>

08:20.132 --> 08:23.033
John, you're a quarterback.
You don't always stick
with the plans.

08:23.034 --> 08:25.669
Yeah, but we're
not playing football,
we're building a house.

08:25.670 --> 08:28.139
All right,
I'm gonna say this once.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.542
You guys know how to tackle,
I know how to spackle,
all right?

08:31.543 --> 08:33.344
<i>(mumbles)</i>
come on, get to work.

08:33.345 --> 08:34.912
Hey, holyfield.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.818
Evander,
give me the doughnut.

08:40.818 --> 08:42.953
I don't think so, tim.

08:45.857 --> 08:47.791
Kelvin, where you been?

08:47.792 --> 08:49.293
Tim, you gave me
wrong directions.

08:49.294 --> 08:51.562
You should have checked them
twice. Right, evander?

08:51.563 --> 08:54.832
Hey, you gave me
the wrong directions, too.
Did I?

08:54.833 --> 08:56.534
Let's do the wall.
Wait a minute.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.469
Do I jump in the ring
and tell you how to box?

09:03.808 --> 09:05.409
Not like I would.

09:07.045 --> 09:09.013
Why don't we build that house?

09:09.014 --> 09:11.516
Nice-looking shirt.

Hey, randy, great news.
Ashley loved the locket.

10:20.185 --> 10:22.986
She's crazy about me.
All right.

10:22.987 --> 10:25.656
You know, this girl thing
is pretty easy.

10:25.657 --> 10:28.426
Just gotta keep finding jewelry
in the street.

10:29.761 --> 10:31.028
Hi, guys.
Hey, boys.

10:31.029 --> 10:32.430
Hey.
Hi, mom.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.931
You were absolutely right.

10:33.932 --> 10:35.766
Couples shouldn't
work together.

10:35.767 --> 10:38.703
If I were on your team,
I'd be way behind, too.

10:40.038 --> 10:42.540
We're not way behind.
We're pacing ourselves.

10:42.541 --> 10:45.376
And why do you turn everything
into a competition?

10:45.377 --> 10:47.211
I just can't help it.

10:47.212 --> 10:49.213
I guess it's just
my estrogen-pumping,

10:49.214 --> 10:51.349
Bone-crunching
feminine side.

10:53.418 --> 10:56.254
Sounds like mom's
kicking your butt.

10:57.522 --> 11:01.759
Yeah, with al
and a team of girls.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.762
You're losing to girls?

11:07.699 --> 11:10.100
I wouldn't consider
miss america a girl.

11:10.101 --> 11:11.669
She's almost professional.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.671
I heard
in her talent competition,

11:13.672 --> 11:15.640
She put up dry wall.

11:17.142 --> 11:19.143
And I'd be doing a lot better

11:19.144 --> 11:22.079
If I wasn't stuck with
a bunch of lightweight wimps!

11:24.048 --> 11:26.817
Hey, guys,
let marie in.
Ok.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.185
Hi, marie.
Hi, marie.

11:28.186 --> 11:31.522
Jill, I'm so upset.
I lost my locket.

11:31.523 --> 11:33.957
That gold one
that you were wearing
yesterday?

11:33.958 --> 11:36.427
My grandmother gave that to me
when I was little.

11:36.428 --> 11:37.928
I can't find it anywhere.

11:37.929 --> 11:39.863
Don't worry about it.
We'll help you.

11:39.864 --> 11:42.933
These boys
can find anything.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.337
I know brad can.

11:53.278 --> 11:55.946
Look, elway, I saw you
goofing around today,

11:55.947 --> 11:59.417
And I'm not gonna
put up with this stuff.

11:59.418 --> 12:02.286
What? Yes, I'd say this
to your face.

12:02.287 --> 12:04.555
I might not be
yelling this loud.

12:06.692 --> 12:10.494
No, you can't be traded
to al's team.

12:10.495 --> 12:12.896
Tomorrow I expect you
lifting something heavier

12:12.897 --> 12:15.700
Than a jelly doughnut.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.702
And why don't you tell that

12:17.703 --> 12:20.671
To your little friend
holyfield, too?

12:20.672 --> 12:23.441
Actually, I'd prefer
if you'd tell him.

12:24.576 --> 12:26.844
Right, ok. Bye, john.

12:26.845 --> 12:29.246
<i>(bang)</i>
oh!

12:29.247 --> 12:31.882
Getting
a little panicky, tim?

12:31.883 --> 12:33.384
I'm not panicking.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.486
The guys just need
a little motivation.

12:35.487 --> 12:37.988
What you guys need
is some women.

12:37.989 --> 12:40.123
They build this house right,

12:40.124 --> 12:42.793
I'll get 'em
all the women they want.

12:42.794 --> 12:45.796
You had your chance
to get me on your team,

12:45.797 --> 12:47.732
And you blew it.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.467
All right, all right.

12:49.468 --> 12:53.036
You wanna be
on the team tomorrow,
you can be on the team.

12:53.037 --> 12:55.840
Might as well
just bring that woman
that does plumbing

12:55.841 --> 12:58.642
And that other gal
that does the roof
with you, too.

12:58.643 --> 13:01.645
So you're ready to admit
that when it comes
to building a house,

13:01.646 --> 13:03.681
Women are as good as men?

13:03.682 --> 13:06.751
Why do you make everything
into a competition?

13:11.990 --> 13:15.025
You should be more like me.
I think everybody's equal.

13:15.026 --> 13:16.594
Since when?

13:16.595 --> 13:18.596
I've always felt that way.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.731
Men are in every way
as equal to women,

13:20.732 --> 13:23.768
And women are in every way
as <i>(coughs)</i> to men.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.204
Well, all I gotta say, tim,

13:27.205 --> 13:31.742
Is my team of women
is beating the <i>(coughs)</i>
out of your team of men.

13:34.679 --> 13:37.648
Dad, I need
to talk to you.

13:37.649 --> 13:39.149
What about?

13:39.150 --> 13:41.218
Ok. All right.

13:41.219 --> 13:43.554
What if you found something
in an alley,

13:43.555 --> 13:45.389
Gave it
to your girlfriend...

13:45.390 --> 13:48.358
Shh. Your mom doesn't know
about my girlfriend.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.997
Dad...
All right. Keep goin'.

13:53.998 --> 13:58.001
And then you found out
it belonged to somebody else,
and you had to get it back.

13:58.002 --> 14:00.504
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

14:00.505 --> 14:02.673
You found something
in the alley.

14:02.674 --> 14:05.342
You didn't bother
to find out the owner of it,

14:05.343 --> 14:08.278
And you gave it
to your girlfriend?

14:08.279 --> 14:09.413
Yeah?

14:09.414 --> 14:11.114
Been there.

14:13.885 --> 14:17.054
You gotta tell the truth.

14:17.055 --> 14:19.523
The truth?
Yeah, tell the truth.

14:19.524 --> 14:22.025
Everything else
is a waste of time.

14:22.026 --> 14:24.528
Women will see
right through you.

14:24.529 --> 14:27.097
They'll make you pay.
<i>(weather report on tv)</i>

14:27.098 --> 14:29.099
How do you know, dad?

14:29.100 --> 14:32.269
'cause I've paid.

14:32.270 --> 14:34.738
Oh, god, have I paid.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.546
Hey, tim, where you been?

14:42.547 --> 14:45.048
We've been working out here
for hours in the rain.

14:45.049 --> 14:48.118
It's intermittent, john.
I was buying an exhaust fan.

14:48.119 --> 14:49.854
We already have
an exhaust fan.

14:49.855 --> 14:51.355
Not like this.

14:51.356 --> 14:55.192
This baby will suck the air
out of a blimp.

14:55.193 --> 14:57.160
Is that all you got done
since I've been gone?

14:57.161 --> 14:59.429
Yeah. You got a problem
with that, tool man?

14:59.430 --> 15:01.866
That's cotton, isn't it?

15:01.867 --> 15:04.902
It's a cotton/rayon mix
or something. Nice.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.737
We're doing
the best we can,

15:06.738 --> 15:08.939
Considering our captain
spends all his time
shopping.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.941
This is
all necessary equipment.
Right, howard?

15:10.942 --> 15:14.678
No, it isn't, and now
they're way ahead of us.

15:14.679 --> 15:16.614
Oh, no.

15:17.782 --> 15:20.885
Hey, mr. Macho,
enjoying the rain?

15:20.886 --> 15:22.987
It's intermittent.

15:22.988 --> 15:26.256
And for your information,
we're way ahead over here.

15:26.257 --> 15:27.791
<i>(laughing)</i> yeah, right.

15:27.792 --> 15:30.293
By the time
you get your siding up,

15:30.294 --> 15:33.397
We'll be done and the owner
will be getting junk mail.

15:33.398 --> 15:36.066
Well, hi-de-ho,
good samaritan tim.

15:37.435 --> 15:40.303
Wilson? What are you doing
over there?

15:40.304 --> 15:43.306
Well, jill told me
about the project
and asked me if I could help.

15:43.307 --> 15:46.476
If you wanted to help,
why didn't you join my team?

15:46.477 --> 15:48.746
Well, tim, aren't we all
on the same team?

15:48.747 --> 15:50.948
No. And your team
seems to be winning.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.551
Tim, this isn't a question
of winning and losing.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.052
Perhaps you're familiar

15:55.053 --> 15:58.756
With the great
german philosopher
immanuel kant.

15:58.757 --> 16:05.462
He said, <i>"idee zu einer</i>
<i>allgemeinen geschichte</i>
<i>in weltburgerlicher absicht."</i>

16:05.463 --> 16:07.431
Ain't that the truth.

16:07.432 --> 16:09.433
Well, tim, all he's saying is,

16:09.434 --> 16:12.970
The important part of generosity
is generosity of the spirit.

16:12.971 --> 16:15.639
Oh, yeah. You gotta
have spirit, don't you?

16:15.640 --> 16:17.741
Hey, wilson,
what are you doing out there?

16:17.742 --> 16:20.744
I was just
explaining to your husband
the meaning of benevolence.

16:20.745 --> 16:23.881
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put a cork in it
and get back to work.

16:23.882 --> 16:28.318
Why don't you go tell her
what you just told me?

16:28.319 --> 16:33.624
Jill? <i>Idee zu einer...</i>

16:34.960 --> 16:37.527
<i>(♪ rock on tv)</i>

16:41.432 --> 16:43.934
<i>(switches tv off)</i>

16:43.935 --> 16:46.536
Um, ashley...
About the locket.

16:46.537 --> 16:49.439
Would it be all right
if I took it back

16:49.440 --> 16:51.441
And got something
even nicer?

16:51.442 --> 16:53.577
Like what?

16:53.578 --> 16:57.147
Um, how about
a bicycle reflector?

16:59.450 --> 17:01.752
Hi, brad. Hi, ashley.

17:01.753 --> 17:03.587
Oh, hi, mrs. Taylor.
Look what...

17:03.588 --> 17:04.821
No!

17:04.823 --> 17:07.523
Brad...

17:07.525 --> 17:09.059
What are you doing?

17:09.060 --> 17:11.428
You looked
like you needed a hug.

17:11.429 --> 17:13.396
Oh. That's so sensitive.

17:13.396 --> 17:16.834
Brad's always been
the sensitive one
in the family.

17:20.070 --> 17:23.440
Try not to be
so sensitive, ok?

17:23.441 --> 17:25.608
Oh, gosh.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.345
I am so sore.

17:28.346 --> 17:31.982
But not as sore
as your father.

17:31.983 --> 17:34.484
Um, come on, ashley.
I'll walk you home,

17:34.485 --> 17:37.487
And, um, we can talk
about what else I can get you,

17:37.488 --> 17:39.322
You know, some other time.

17:39.323 --> 17:40.590
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

17:42.393 --> 17:43.593
Hi, brad.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.966
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
<i>(jill)</i> brad, get the door!

17:48.967 --> 17:52.903
Ok! I'll meet you
in the backyard.
Ok.

17:52.904 --> 17:55.706
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

17:55.707 --> 17:57.708
Nice greeting.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.711
Hi, marie.
Hi, jill. Do you guys
have a staple gun?

18:00.712 --> 18:03.580
I wanna put up fliers
about the locket I lost.
<i>(knock on door)</i>

18:05.016 --> 18:08.185
Why is ashley
in the backyard?

18:08.186 --> 18:13.256
Uh, she doesn't have one,
so I said she could use ours.

18:15.459 --> 18:19.063
Brad, what is
going on here?
Nothing.

18:19.064 --> 18:22.465
Um... I think
I saw the staple gun
in the garage.

18:22.466 --> 18:25.069
Right. I'll go get it.
Yeah.

18:28.406 --> 18:30.708
Hey, butthead.

18:32.510 --> 18:34.144
Hi, marie.
Hi, tim.

18:34.145 --> 18:37.848
Brad. Well, how'd it go
with your girlfriend?

18:37.849 --> 18:40.818
I think I'm almost
out of the woods.

18:40.819 --> 18:45.155
Oh, how many times
I've said those words.

18:45.156 --> 18:48.558
Brad, look what happened.
The chain on my locket broke.

18:48.559 --> 18:51.394
Let me take a look at it,
ashley.

18:51.395 --> 18:54.397
It's nothing. I can fix it
with my needle-nose pliers
in the garage.

18:54.398 --> 18:57.000
No, dad, don't go
in the garage.
Why not?

18:57.001 --> 18:59.436
Tim! Oh, you found
my locket.

18:59.437 --> 19:02.106
No, this is ashley's.
I'm just fixing the thing.

19:02.107 --> 19:03.974
Yeah, that's my locket.
Brad gave it to me.

19:03.975 --> 19:07.077
No, no. Honey, my grandmother
gave me this locket.

19:07.078 --> 19:11.648
Oh... Oh.
Looks like somebody here
didn't tell the truth!

19:13.618 --> 19:16.186
Brad?

19:16.187 --> 19:17.988
Brad?

19:17.989 --> 19:20.390
Tim?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.827
Don't look at me.

19:23.828 --> 19:25.996
I told him
to tell the truth.

19:25.997 --> 19:28.665
Well, I guess I'm gonna
have to pay, huh, dad?

19:28.666 --> 19:30.600
Oh, god,
are you gonna pay.

19:34.338 --> 19:37.007
Well, the tension is mounting
at this habitat site.

19:37.008 --> 19:39.009
We're waiting
for the final inspection.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.511
There's the inspector now.
He just looked at al's house.

19:41.512 --> 19:44.214
Judging by the look on his face,
he's not too happy.

19:44.215 --> 19:47.184
Larry, go in
and see if you can see
what they're saying.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.790
Al, jill... You did
an exceptional job.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.993
In fact,
I think you built
the perfect house.

19:55.994 --> 19:59.129
Thank you,
inspector.
Thank you!

20:01.833 --> 20:04.301
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

20:04.302 --> 20:07.137
Well, the inspectors
are overly polite sometimes.

20:07.138 --> 20:09.173
They appreciate hard work.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.675
And after we come back,
we're gonna see

20:11.676 --> 20:14.711
The tim taylor...
"more perfect" house.

20:18.950 --> 20:21.051
Oh, tim,
looks like our house

20:21.052 --> 20:23.453
Is gonna be pretty hard
to beat.

20:23.454 --> 20:25.722
Jill, this isn't
a competition.
I know it's not.

20:25.723 --> 20:28.992
You're darn right it's not.
Elway, come on. Let's go bask
in our glory.

20:28.993 --> 20:30.994
Ok, guys, stand by.

20:30.995 --> 20:35.498
And 5, 4, 3, 2...

20:35.499 --> 20:38.702
Welcome back. Now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

20:38.703 --> 20:41.571
A little gander at my house.
Come on in.

20:41.572 --> 20:44.241
Inspector,
I think you're gonna be
remarkably impressed

20:44.242 --> 20:46.543
With the quality
of workmanship.

20:46.544 --> 20:48.045
Let's go in.

20:50.982 --> 20:53.917
Doorknobs were
elway's department.

20:57.889 --> 21:00.090
This is very nice.
Thank you.

21:00.091 --> 21:01.591
I like the archway.

21:01.592 --> 21:04.427
Well, we, um... We didn't go
by just the plans.

21:04.428 --> 21:06.930
We actually made
some improvements in the house

21:06.931 --> 21:08.265
On our own.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.868
Wait till you see the kitchen.
Come on in.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.338
Those upper cabinets
are equipped

21:14.339 --> 21:16.340
With fully concealed
adjustable hinges,

21:16.341 --> 21:18.842
And we installed
a reverse osmosis
water filtration system.

21:18.843 --> 21:21.211
<i>(sucking/clicking sounds)</i>

21:24.015 --> 21:27.017
Should have never put holyfield
in charge of plumbing.

21:27.018 --> 21:30.420
Look at the rest of the house.
The kitchen needs a little work,
but come on this way.

21:30.421 --> 21:32.655
Look at this bathroom here,
huh?

21:32.656 --> 21:34.925
Yeah, that's nice.
That's great.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.427
You gotta try
our new exhaust fan, though.

21:37.428 --> 21:39.429
At least try that.
First switch here.
Custom.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.365
<i>(whooshing)</i>

21:44.668 --> 21:48.005
The living room.
It's our pride and joy.
Try that.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.107
I'll try to find that hat.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.016
Jill, guess what I got.

21:59.017 --> 22:02.352
A video
from president carter.

22:02.353 --> 22:04.288
Good guess.

22:04.289 --> 22:06.957
His office called
to see if we got it.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.026
Well, we did.
This is great.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.028
It's his thank-you
or something.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.396
Let's watch.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.435
<i>Hi, tim, al and jill.</i>

22:18.436 --> 22:20.603
<i>I'd like to thank you</i>
<i>for your participation</i>

22:20.604 --> 22:22.572
<i>In our habitat for humanity</i>

You're welcome.

22:25.676 --> 22:27.677
<i>Al and jill,</i>
<i>the house you built</i>

22:27.678 --> 22:30.013
<i>Is a perfect example</i>
<i>of what can happen</i>

22:30.014 --> 22:32.582
<i>When caring people</i>
<i>band together</i>
