WEBVTT

00:03.193 --> 00:04.760
What?

00:04.795 --> 00:06.095
Lemon, I'm gonna be
late for our meeting.

00:06.129 --> 00:07.830
I had to get out
of my car and walk.

00:07.864 --> 00:11.133
Fifth Avenue is closed
for a joint pain walkathon.

00:11.168 --> 00:13.902
It's only four blocks
but they are so slow.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.271
I'm running late, too.

00:15.305 --> 00:18.073
My subway ride was
the standard amazingness.

00:18.108 --> 00:20.926
No, that's not how it works.

00:20.961 --> 00:23.262
Let people off first,
otherwise...

00:23.296 --> 00:24.630
The train's going
express for no reason.

00:26.416 --> 00:27.650
Next stop,
one millionth street

00:27.684 --> 00:28.784
and Central Park jogger
memorial highway.

00:28.819 --> 00:30.019
Am I the last one
in this city

00:30.053 --> 00:32.521
still following the rules
of being a person?

00:32.555 --> 00:35.024
You know what,
New York is overrated.

00:35.058 --> 00:40.479
<i> Three bucks, two bags,
one me </i>

00:40.530 --> 00:42.648
Say, where does
a young prostitute

00:42.699 --> 00:44.316
get started in this town?

00:44.367 --> 00:45.401
Overrated?

00:45.435 --> 00:47.203
Lemon, we live in
the world capital

00:47.237 --> 00:49.989
of culture, finance
and King Kong attacks.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.441
New York is a testament
to man's greatness.

00:52.459 --> 00:55.161
No, New York is a testament
to man's selfishness.

00:55.212 --> 00:58.130
I quote, "she is a thug
in a cocktail dress."

00:58.165 --> 01:00.216
Alex Mccord,
<i>Real housewives of New York.</i>

01:00.250 --> 01:01.684
Give me your wallet.

01:01.718 --> 01:03.552
Now, technically that was
about Luann being a bitch

01:03.587 --> 01:04.753
at Sonia's Art show.

01:04.787 --> 01:06.922
But... hey, you never
let me talk

01:06.956 --> 01:08.340
about h-wives this long.

01:08.391 --> 01:09.725
Let's just get this
over with.

01:09.759 --> 01:11.760
Okay, well, I don't know
if Sonja's ever

01:11.794 --> 01:13.479
gonna finish that
toaster oven cookbook,

01:13.513 --> 01:15.331
but if she does,
I am gonna buy it.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

30 ROCK
S06 Ep.08 - The Tuxedo Begins

01:31.088 --> 01:33.688
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

01:33.717 --> 01:36.252
I can actually feel
myself getting sick.

01:36.286 --> 01:37.819
Am I the only person who saw

01:37.837 --> 01:40.005
Obama's press conference
on how to sneeze?

01:43.260 --> 01:46.512
Miss Lemon, the NBC gym sent
this up for you.

01:46.546 --> 01:48.013
What is that smell?!

01:48.048 --> 01:49.548
It's my gym bag, Pete.

01:49.599 --> 01:50.683
Women do sweat.

01:50.717 --> 01:52.535
The gym said the odor
was attracting bugs

01:52.569 --> 01:55.304
that were attracting bats that
were attracting bat-hawks.

01:55.338 --> 01:56.855
Also, the gym is closed.

01:56.890 --> 01:59.508
Well, don't worry, I will
wash my workout clothes

01:59.543 --> 02:02.361
because I actually care how my
behavior affects other people.

02:02.395 --> 02:04.680
Unlike the d-bag
who let the elevator door

02:04.698 --> 02:05.898
close on me this morning.

02:05.949 --> 02:06.982
It was funny because

02:07.017 --> 02:08.050
you were so mad.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.185
Boy, when I move on
to my new job

02:10.203 --> 02:13.405
I'm sure gonna miss you two and
your whole Sam and Diane thing.

02:13.456 --> 02:15.324
Sam and Diane
are the lesbian couple

02:15.358 --> 02:18.911
in my building
who murdered each other.

02:18.962 --> 02:22.214
Is this my costume for
the commercial parody?

02:22.249 --> 02:24.583
It's in my contract that
I only play blondes,

02:24.634 --> 02:27.736
non-Irish redheads,
or bald sex robots.

02:27.771 --> 02:29.388
Look, it's just for
the old lady before picture.

02:29.422 --> 02:30.556
People won't even know it's you.

02:30.590 --> 02:31.924
Well then have Liz do it.

02:31.975 --> 02:33.642
She already has the frown lines.

02:33.677 --> 02:35.110
There, there they are.

02:35.145 --> 02:37.012
How funny, I was just talking
about them and there they are.

02:37.047 --> 02:39.932
As always, I will
step up and help

02:39.983 --> 02:41.317
because without people like me,

02:41.351 --> 02:43.686
civil society collapses
completely.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.221
Don't be so dramatic.
That's my thing.

02:46.256 --> 02:48.190
And if you take it away from me,
I will kill myself.

02:48.224 --> 02:50.943
And then you.

02:50.994 --> 02:53.912
I'm sorry
we're starting so late.

02:53.947 --> 02:57.099
I know we're all very excited
to adjust the <i>TGS</i> schedule

02:57.133 --> 02:58.801
to accommodate Tracy's
next movie.

02:58.835 --> 03:01.136
I won an Oscar,
so now I get to do real art.

03:01.171 --> 03:03.472
Begins <i>no dogs</i> phase.

03:03.506 --> 03:05.207
There was a lot
of traffic and, uh,

03:05.241 --> 03:08.077
I was attacked in
a construction tunnel.

03:08.111 --> 03:10.479
Anyway, uh, this spreadsheet
is the current schedule.

03:10.513 --> 03:11.597
Wait, you got mugged?

03:11.631 --> 03:14.183
I shouldn't hug you,
I'm sick.

03:14.217 --> 03:17.186
This lamp is you.

03:17.220 --> 03:19.121
Hot!

03:19.155 --> 03:21.273
That sucks, J.D.

03:21.308 --> 03:23.609
I got mugged all the time
growing up in the Bronx.

03:23.643 --> 03:25.995
Okay, I got in trouble
the last time I said this,

03:26.029 --> 03:28.497
but maybe you were asking
for it dressed like that.

03:28.531 --> 03:31.317
I wasn't wearing a tuxedo
at the time, Lemon.

03:31.368 --> 03:32.868
The mugger took my cufflinks.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.820
All I have here are
tuxedo cufflinks

03:34.871 --> 03:38.240
and I'm not about to
wear them with a suit...

03:38.274 --> 03:39.541
And look like an idiot.

03:39.576 --> 03:41.010
Give me the bad news.

03:41.044 --> 03:42.878
How black was this dude?

03:42.912 --> 03:46.015
On a scale
from Lisa Bonet to dotcom.

03:46.049 --> 03:48.083
This is the thing
that's bothering me.

03:48.118 --> 03:51.286
My assailant was
a middle-aged white man

03:51.321 --> 03:54.089
wearing a button down shirt
and dockers.

03:54.124 --> 03:55.457
Dockers!

03:55.492 --> 03:58.460
Not some drug addict
or gang aficionado.

03:58.495 --> 04:00.396
His knife was from Eddie Bauer.

04:00.430 --> 04:02.164
My God.

04:02.198 --> 04:05.300
That means...

04:05.335 --> 04:06.769
Please interrupt me.

04:06.803 --> 04:08.237
This is a sign.

04:08.271 --> 04:10.205
The lower classes
are getting cranky

04:10.240 --> 04:12.141
about the rich earning all of
their money away from them.

04:12.175 --> 04:15.244
Can't they see this is
in their best interest?

04:15.278 --> 04:18.714
How could we pay their salaries
without using their money?

04:18.748 --> 04:21.250
We're on the verge
of a class war.

04:21.284 --> 04:22.685
There's no class war.

04:22.719 --> 04:25.320
You getting mugged just proves
what I said to you on the phone.

04:25.355 --> 04:27.556
New York is
a selfish filth-monster,

04:27.590 --> 04:29.091
and eventually,
it gets all of us.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.726
It's <i>Ghostbusters 2</i>
all over again.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.062
No, my getting mugged
was New York doing

04:33.096 --> 04:36.832
what she does best...
Calling a great man to action.

04:36.866 --> 04:39.435
It's the original <i>Ghostbusters</i>
all over again.

04:39.469 --> 04:41.070
My attack was a wake up call.

04:41.104 --> 04:43.272
The rich need
to defend themselves.

04:43.306 --> 04:45.007
I don't know, Jack.

04:45.041 --> 04:48.410
You can try to change New York,
but it's like Jay-Z says.

04:48.445 --> 04:50.779
"Concrete bunghole
where dreams are made up.

04:50.814 --> 04:53.816
There's nothing you can do."

04:55.919 --> 04:57.019
That's a wrap.

04:57.053 --> 04:58.053
That commercial parody

04:58.088 --> 04:59.688
is gonna be hilarious.

04:59.723 --> 05:03.425
What's a commercial?

05:05.428 --> 05:06.395
Oh, my God.

05:06.429 --> 05:08.163
You sound terrible.

05:08.198 --> 05:11.600
Is that brain?

05:11.634 --> 05:14.636
Hopefully it's not an important
parg of my blurn.

05:14.671 --> 05:16.105
Please, don't get me sick.

05:16.139 --> 05:17.906
Paul's finally
coming home tonight.

05:17.941 --> 05:20.075
And his sexpectations
will be high.

05:20.110 --> 05:21.343
Maybe I should wear this home.

05:21.377 --> 05:23.245
Show Chris what he'll be looking
at in 40 years.

05:23.279 --> 05:28.117
Looser skin, same underwear.

05:28.151 --> 05:30.486
Hey, Pete, can I have
a car home tonight?

05:30.520 --> 05:32.271
I'm old and very sick.

05:32.322 --> 05:34.606
And there's a <i>Monk</i> rerun on.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.659
I'm sorry,
I'm losing my voice.

05:37.694 --> 05:39.411
- There's a <i>Monk</i> rerun on.
- Nope, no dice.

05:39.446 --> 05:41.163
I can't order you a car
unless it's after 9:00,

05:41.197 --> 05:42.831
or you have a note
from your killer.

05:42.866 --> 05:45.134
Aw.

05:45.168 --> 05:47.453
So you got mugged,
Mr. Donaghy?

05:47.504 --> 05:48.937
And you caught
the guy who did it.

05:48.972 --> 05:50.139
Good for you.

05:50.173 --> 05:53.108
No, Len, Tracey
is helping me with this.

05:53.143 --> 05:54.710
But I can see
how you went there.

05:54.744 --> 05:56.545
I have a criminal skull shape.

05:56.579 --> 05:59.465
Len, commissioner Kelly
and I are friends.

05:59.516 --> 06:02.618
We have competing columns in
<i>Irish arguments weekly,</i>

06:02.652 --> 06:04.753
America's only
all-caps magazine,

06:04.788 --> 06:06.582
but Ray hasn't returned
my phone call,

06:06.583 --> 06:08.791
and I know that you were
once a police officer.

06:08.825 --> 06:10.659
I was part of
a special task force

06:10.693 --> 06:13.695
of very young-looking cops
who infiltrated high schools.

06:15.532 --> 06:16.949
How do you do, fellow kids?

06:16.983 --> 06:18.200
What?

06:18.234 --> 06:19.701
So I'm glad you called me,
Mr. Donaghy.

06:19.736 --> 06:22.287
I checked with my contacts
on the force

06:22.322 --> 06:23.972
and got you this
free pamphlet.

06:24.007 --> 06:26.041
Len, I don't want a pamphlet.

06:26.075 --> 06:27.543
I want a show of force.

06:27.577 --> 06:30.245
A demonstration of who's
in control of this city.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.014
I want a cop on every corner.

06:32.048 --> 06:33.882
Look,
that's not gonna happen.

06:33.917 --> 06:35.184
It's just one mugging.

06:35.218 --> 06:36.585
Wait a second.

06:36.619 --> 06:37.653
Where did you get that suit?

06:37.687 --> 06:38.971
I'm not embarrassed.

06:39.005 --> 06:41.390
I get all my outfits
at Ann Taylor loft.

06:41.424 --> 06:43.125
Their clothes fit
my body and my budget.

06:43.159 --> 06:44.726
Exactly, budget.

06:44.761 --> 06:46.395
You have no interest
in helping me.

06:46.429 --> 06:47.496
You're one of them.

06:47.530 --> 06:48.831
What do you make? 
Five figures?

06:48.865 --> 06:50.699
40 grand a year.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.935
But don't let the woman who's
blackmailing me know that.

06:52.969 --> 06:55.270
And the police have no
interest in helping me either

06:55.305 --> 06:57.973
despite the hundreds of dollars
I pay every year in taxes.

06:58.007 --> 06:59.041
They think that I'm the enemy.

06:59.075 --> 06:59.989
We have no choice

06:59.990 --> 07:02.194
but to take matters
into our own hands.

07:02.245 --> 07:05.514
- I agree!
- You do? No!

07:19.157 --> 07:22.159
No, if I sneeze, I'll do it
like the president taught me.

07:32.336 --> 07:36.540
I'm pregnant with a kitty cat.

07:36.574 --> 07:39.576
Those are my popsicles!

07:50.655 --> 07:53.123
Well, hello, sexy.

07:53.157 --> 07:54.858
Hello, Paul.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.393
I'm wearing
an edible nightgown.

07:56.427 --> 07:59.296
It's breadstick flavor and it
comes with a dipping sauce.

08:00.431 --> 08:01.915
You poor thing.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.400
You must be so tired.

08:03.434 --> 08:04.501
No, no, no, not at all.

08:04.535 --> 08:05.602
I have been thinking
about this night

08:05.636 --> 08:07.754
for a long time.

08:07.789 --> 08:11.141
Uhyawns are contagious.

08:11.175 --> 08:13.877
Like all the Thai STDs my
penis is about to give you.

08:15.847 --> 08:20.083
Okay, well, give me five
minutes and then I'll unpack...

08:22.437 --> 08:25.238
The sex monkey
I bought in Jakarta.

08:35.366 --> 08:37.067
What... what happened
last night?

08:37.101 --> 08:40.587
We talked for a while
and then we fell asleep.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.054
Without doing anything.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.591
W... how is that possible?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.059
We are Jenna and Paul.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.462
Did we mix up our days
and accidentally

08:48.496 --> 08:49.529
both roofie each other?

08:49.564 --> 08:51.331
Or did we just fall asleep?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.633
What like some boring,
normal, sit-com couple?

08:53.668 --> 08:55.836
Like, Mr. Brady
and tiger the dog?

08:55.870 --> 08:57.237
Let's just think.

08:57.271 --> 08:59.172
We hate normal.

08:59.207 --> 09:00.674
Normal is death.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.543
But we didn't hate last night.

09:03.578 --> 09:06.446
So, it must not
have been normal.

09:06.481 --> 09:10.717
Paul, I think we just found
another level of sexuality.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.153
It's a whole new fetish
called...

09:13.187 --> 09:14.988
Normalling.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.691
So last night,
I napped on you

09:17.725 --> 09:19.860
and you liked it,
you sick bitch.

09:19.894 --> 09:21.194
Yeah.

09:21.229 --> 09:24.231
And I put that Afghan
all over you

09:24.265 --> 09:26.833
because I thought
your feet might get chilly.

09:26.868 --> 09:28.101
So chilly.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.203
I just had
the sickest idea.

09:30.238 --> 09:32.606
We go out as a couple
to bed, bath and beyond

09:32.640 --> 09:35.141
and shop for home necessities.

09:35.176 --> 09:38.211
In front of everybody.

09:38.246 --> 09:41.014
Normalling in public?
You delicious whore.

09:42.183 --> 09:45.352
Really, Trump?
My idea is stupid?

09:45.386 --> 09:46.653
Well you make your
hair every morning

09:46.687 --> 09:50.123
by sticking your head in
a cotton candy machine.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.424
What are you guys doing?

09:51.459 --> 09:53.260
The police can't be counted on

09:53.294 --> 09:55.228
to protect the rich unless
they're rich too.

09:55.263 --> 09:58.465
So we're gathering support
for a private police department

09:58.499 --> 10:00.534
where the starting
salary is...

10:00.568 --> 10:01.668
$5 million a year.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.769
How's that going?

10:02.803 --> 10:03.837
Slowly.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.572
Even Tommy Hilfiger
turned me down

10:05.623 --> 10:07.374
and you'd think that he,
of all people,

10:07.408 --> 10:09.726
would understand the lower
classes can ruin something.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.246
Plaxico Burress just called
our idea "poorly thought out".

10:13.297 --> 10:15.165
Then hung up by
shooting his own phone.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.399
This is a travesty.

10:16.434 --> 10:19.252
The wealthy were once
the heart of New York.

10:19.303 --> 10:20.737
I just don't understand
this city anymore.

10:20.771 --> 10:23.640
That's funny, because I may
have just figured it out.

10:33.434 --> 10:35.051
I used to be like you,

10:35.086 --> 10:37.487
thinking I could make the city
follow my rules.

10:37.521 --> 10:40.556
I told off line cutters
and movie theater talkers.

10:40.575 --> 10:41.908
And for what?

10:41.943 --> 10:45.028
Did anyone cheer me,
or name a sandwich after me

10:45.062 --> 10:46.896
that would maybe be Turkey,
pastrami, Swiss,

10:46.914 --> 10:50.066
Russian dressing,
Cole slaw and potato chips?

10:50.101 --> 10:52.903
You can't count on anyone else
in this city, Jack.

10:52.937 --> 10:56.289
All you can do is sink down
into the filth.

10:57.341 --> 10:59.342
Or rise above it.

10:59.377 --> 11:01.144
If no one will help me,
I'll do it myself.

11:01.178 --> 11:03.847
I'll remind New York
of what she once was.

11:03.881 --> 11:06.466
Yes, a native American
paradise!

11:06.517 --> 11:08.685
The greatest city on earth.

11:08.719 --> 11:10.220
A city that needs a leader

11:10.254 --> 11:11.855
who still believes
in order and justice.

11:11.889 --> 11:13.807
Who'll shine a light
into all the tunnels

11:13.858 --> 11:15.825
and police the police,

11:15.860 --> 11:18.261
who'll make this city
into a beacon,

11:18.296 --> 11:20.964
lighting the way
for an entire nation.

11:20.998 --> 11:24.150
Anyhoo, Tracy,
in the dog boner sketch.

11:24.201 --> 11:28.288
I hereby officially
announce my candidacy...

11:28.322 --> 11:32.275
For the office of Mayor
of the city of New York.

11:32.310 --> 11:36.513
Vote for Jack Donaghy.

11:36.547 --> 11:38.147
Slogan to come.

11:42.605 --> 11:44.105
You know if we
got cloth place mats

11:44.139 --> 11:45.690
then we could just
throw them in the laundry.

11:45.741 --> 11:49.010
Well, these vinyl ones say
dishwasher safe, that's easy.

11:49.045 --> 11:51.379
Yeah, easy for the person
who never does the dishes.

11:53.649 --> 11:55.834
What we're doing
is so sick, right?

11:55.868 --> 11:57.369
How many times
have you climaxed?

11:57.420 --> 11:58.386
Zero.

11:58.421 --> 11:59.754
Me too.

11:59.789 --> 12:00.956
Bathroom organizers!

12:03.176 --> 12:05.427
Good news for
your campaign, J.D.

12:05.461 --> 12:07.095
I got a huge list
of voter names.

12:07.129 --> 12:09.998
Do you know anyone who wants to
be called Daryl Weenus?

12:10.032 --> 12:13.468
I just registered the domain
name for my campaign website...

12:13.503 --> 12:15.971
Jack-Donaghy-is-running
for-mayor-2013

12:16.005 --> 12:17.672
new-York-this-is
the-website.Com.

12:17.707 --> 12:19.508
That's as close
as I could get.

12:19.542 --> 12:21.693
Everything else
was already pornography.

12:21.727 --> 12:24.863
I got everything on
your list, Mr. Donaghy,

12:24.897 --> 12:26.781
fresh undershirts
from Vattene,

12:26.816 --> 12:28.717
18-year-old scotch
for your bar,

12:28.751 --> 12:30.518
and, just for fun,

12:30.536 --> 12:33.221
I also got you these
goofy water balloons

12:33.256 --> 12:36.241
my mom's friend Ron used to
always send me out to buy.

12:36.292 --> 12:40.128
Thank you, Kenneth.

12:40.162 --> 12:42.163
I know they're condoms.

12:42.197 --> 12:44.198
All right, Tracy,
let's buckle down.

12:44.217 --> 12:45.567
Now that I've restocked,

12:45.601 --> 12:50.922
we never have to
leave this office.

12:50.973 --> 12:53.008
Hang on... have you not
left this building

12:53.042 --> 12:54.259
since you were mugged?

12:54.310 --> 12:56.778
What? No,
I've been very busy.

12:56.812 --> 12:57.855
What about your daughter?

12:57.856 --> 13:00.065
Liddy is at a baby leadership
conference this week.

13:00.099 --> 13:01.283
The timing is perfect.

13:01.317 --> 13:02.384
I know what you're doing.

13:02.418 --> 13:03.518
The first time I got mugged,

13:03.553 --> 13:05.020
I didn't leave
my room for a week.

13:05.054 --> 13:06.922
I hid, but not in a tuxedo.

13:06.956 --> 13:09.324
All I had was
a Chewbacca costume

13:09.358 --> 13:11.526
made out of used
hair extensions.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.395
It made me feel invincible.

13:13.429 --> 13:15.196
Like someone who
wouldn't get scared

13:15.230 --> 13:17.415
and freeze up when
they got mugged.

13:17.450 --> 13:20.919
Perfectly-executed
Chewbacca sounds!

13:20.953 --> 13:23.238
That's why you won't
take off that tuxedo,

13:23.272 --> 13:24.673
that's why you're
running for mayor,

13:24.707 --> 13:26.608
and that's why you
won't go outside.

13:26.642 --> 13:27.592
You're scared.

13:27.627 --> 13:30.045
The only thing I'm scared of is
what's happening to this city.

13:30.079 --> 13:31.479
Then I'm gonna say
to you what I say

13:31.514 --> 13:33.748
to all my sharks
right before they die.

13:33.783 --> 13:36.384
Let's go outside.

13:39.138 --> 13:40.939
Jenna, I have a friend...

13:40.973 --> 13:42.307
Yeah, well I have
a million friends.

13:42.358 --> 13:44.059
I get so many birthday cards
it's embarrassing.

13:44.093 --> 13:46.061
No, I have a "friend"

13:46.095 --> 13:48.029
who wants to freak out
some new yorkers,

13:48.064 --> 13:50.448
and I know you and
Paul disgust everyone.

13:50.483 --> 13:52.784
He and I are
on a whole new level.

13:52.818 --> 13:55.136
This morning, Paul and
I signed up for zipcar.

13:55.171 --> 13:59.240
Now it's easier to get to
Costco to stock up on cereal.

13:59.274 --> 14:01.009
Lee, I need
the old lady wig again.

14:01.043 --> 14:03.795
And get me that coat that
Tracy's dog gave birth on.

14:03.829 --> 14:05.246
A Costco run,

14:05.280 --> 14:06.631
You sound like me and Paula.

14:06.666 --> 14:08.249
No, Pete you don't understand.

14:08.283 --> 14:09.517
This is normalling.

14:09.552 --> 14:10.885
It's a weird sex thing.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.756
Paul and I do things
like reboot the Internet

14:14.790 --> 14:17.058
and discuss whether
the chair would be better...

14:17.093 --> 14:18.760
Over by the window where
there's more light?

14:18.794 --> 14:20.312
Yeah, that... that's not
a sex thing.

14:20.346 --> 14:21.646
That's just couple stuff.

14:21.681 --> 14:23.815
Hey, you and Paul should come by
the house sometime.

14:23.849 --> 14:25.183
We'll have dinner,
play scattergories.

14:25.234 --> 14:28.036
No, that's not what this is.

14:28.070 --> 14:29.154
You get away from me!

14:29.188 --> 14:31.306
Scattergories.

14:34.443 --> 14:37.846
Where? Where?

14:37.880 --> 14:40.198
Miss Lemon, are you okay?

14:40.249 --> 14:42.834
You smell like when
the stone Mountain tire fire

14:42.868 --> 14:44.185
joined up
with the corpse fire,

14:44.220 --> 14:47.422
and then swept through
the downtown Manure district.

14:47.456 --> 14:48.540
It was our fault for letting

14:48.591 --> 14:50.191
those high schoolers
dance at their prom.

14:50.226 --> 14:52.127
I'm better
than okay, Kenneth.

14:52.161 --> 14:53.494
I'm going to the movies.

14:53.512 --> 14:55.430
But you're sick.
I am sick.

14:55.464 --> 14:57.265
Sick like a fox.

14:57.299 --> 14:58.800
I'm gonna clear out
that whole theater

14:58.834 --> 15:01.770
and watch a sneak peak of
<i>The hunger games</i> by myself.

15:01.804 --> 15:03.872
It'll be my greatest triumph.

15:03.906 --> 15:06.074
There's a Q & A
afterwards with...

15:06.108 --> 15:08.009
The screenwriter?

15:08.044 --> 15:10.011
Miss Lemon, this isn't you.

15:10.046 --> 15:11.413
You love rules.

15:11.447 --> 15:13.514
Try to remember.

15:13.532 --> 15:15.050
Remember who you once were.

15:15.084 --> 15:16.785
What did the rules
ever get me?

15:16.819 --> 15:18.520
The worst seat at the movies?

15:18.554 --> 15:20.905
A bunch of music
that I paid for?

15:20.956 --> 15:22.690
A drawer full
of leaky batteries

15:22.708 --> 15:24.376
that I don't know
what to do with?

15:24.410 --> 15:25.493
Rules?

15:25.528 --> 15:27.228
There's only one rule now,
Kenneth.

15:27.263 --> 15:29.631
Plastic cups go on the top rack

15:29.665 --> 15:31.416
of the dishwasher
so they don't melt.

15:31.467 --> 15:34.469
Otherwise, no rules.

15:46.515 --> 15:50.185
Well, well, well.

15:50.219 --> 15:53.221
If isn't the tuxedo himself.

15:55.925 --> 15:58.993
Shouldn't you be outside,
fixing the city?

15:59.028 --> 16:02.464
Well you look even closer
to death than usual.

16:02.498 --> 16:05.400
- What happened to you?
- Are you scared?

16:05.434 --> 16:07.568
The back of the "B" train
certainly was.

16:07.586 --> 16:09.403
I had the whole car to myself.

16:09.422 --> 16:12.373
So this is you
figuring out New York?

16:12.407 --> 16:16.628
Making the city worse
for your own selfish ends?

16:20.883 --> 16:22.884
Is that your gym bag?

16:22.918 --> 16:24.819
Aren't you a human woman?

16:24.854 --> 16:26.488
It's these new microfibers.

16:26.522 --> 16:28.323
They keep you dry

16:28.357 --> 16:31.443
but it all has to go
somewhere.

16:31.477 --> 16:35.096
So, today a subway car,
tomorrow, what?

16:35.114 --> 16:38.867
All in good time, Jack.

16:38.901 --> 16:40.969
Will you take something for
that cough already?

16:41.003 --> 16:42.704
I'd rather see if it gets
better on it's own.

16:42.738 --> 16:45.039
Do you want me to go
on my antibiotic rant?

16:45.074 --> 16:47.375
It's endless.
You'll beg for death.

16:47.409 --> 16:49.811
There's a war
going on out there.

16:49.845 --> 16:52.080
And you're gonna
have to pick a side.

16:52.114 --> 16:53.581
I've always wanted
to say that,

16:53.616 --> 16:55.616
and I can't believe
I've wasted it on you.

17:00.322 --> 17:02.590
You've crossed a line,
Lemon.

17:02.625 --> 17:06.176
Someone's gonna stop you.
New York is gonna stop you.

17:06.228 --> 17:08.646
The old Liz would
have agreed with you.

17:08.681 --> 17:10.298
But that was two days ago.

17:10.332 --> 17:13.734
Now, I don't cross lines,

17:13.769 --> 17:18.439
I just make 'em...
disappear.

17:22.044 --> 17:24.579
Hey, hon, I got your g-chat.

17:24.597 --> 17:26.414
Two exclamation points,

17:26.432 --> 17:27.765
What's up?

17:27.800 --> 17:30.251
Paul, what if normalling
isn't a fetish?

17:30.286 --> 17:32.720
What if we're just in another
phase of our relationship

17:32.754 --> 17:35.756
and we're kind of...
Settling down?

17:37.860 --> 17:40.328
That's what one of my
work colleagues said.

17:40.362 --> 17:41.646
That's just couple stuff.

17:41.697 --> 17:44.098
You know what, you and Jenna
should come visit me

17:44.116 --> 17:45.366
and my wife in Montclair.

17:45.401 --> 17:47.368
But if Daryl Weenus is right,

17:47.403 --> 17:49.838
if we're just a couple,
why don't we hate it?

17:49.872 --> 17:51.039
I don't know.

17:51.073 --> 17:52.307
I always imagined
this kind of thing

17:52.341 --> 17:54.709
would make me wanna tear my hair
out and rip my skin off.

17:54.743 --> 17:57.629
But with you, it feels
as natural as...

17:57.663 --> 18:00.682
Having someone tear your hair
out and rip your skin off.

18:00.716 --> 18:03.051
I never thought this would
happen to me, but I can actually

18:03.085 --> 18:06.054
imagine myself
getting married, having kids.

18:06.088 --> 18:08.089
But is this really
what we want?

18:08.123 --> 18:10.258
I don't know.

18:10.292 --> 18:12.594
- What are you thinking?
- What are you thinking?

18:12.628 --> 18:14.128
Okay, we'll both say
what we're thinking

18:14.162 --> 18:15.230
on the count of three.

18:15.264 --> 18:17.165
One... two...

18:17.199 --> 18:18.566
Sexual walkabout.

18:18.601 --> 18:20.301
We spend the next
three months alone,

18:20.335 --> 18:22.370
doing every depraved
thing we can think of

18:22.404 --> 18:23.938
with as many people as we can

18:23.973 --> 18:26.841
and if this, right now,
is still the happiest

18:26.859 --> 18:29.861
we can make ourselves,
we'll stay together forever.

18:32.248 --> 18:36.117
Next stop,
dinner and a private show.

18:36.151 --> 18:37.535
Gym bag, check.

18:37.570 --> 18:41.322
Tupperware vat of steamed
broccoli, check.

18:41.356 --> 18:44.492
Talking to myself to seem
crazy... moo-goo!

18:44.526 --> 18:46.961
Wallet.

18:46.996 --> 18:48.930
No, not wow.

18:48.964 --> 18:50.748
Not when I'm so close.

18:50.799 --> 18:53.034
Not enough time!

18:53.052 --> 18:54.201
My plan.

18:59.108 --> 19:01.242
Come on, Donaghy.

19:01.277 --> 19:03.611
You've skied Mount St. Helen's,

19:03.646 --> 19:06.047
made eye contact
with Michelle Bachmann,

19:06.081 --> 19:08.983
been trapped under
a Boulder for 128 hours.

19:09.018 --> 19:12.020
You're not scared of anything.

19:13.789 --> 19:15.222
Gimme $20!

19:20.429 --> 19:21.746
Lemon!

19:21.780 --> 19:24.398
My tail bone.

19:24.416 --> 19:27.001
I just wanted
to borrow movie money.

19:27.036 --> 19:29.671
You caught that lunatic that's
been terrorizing the subway.

19:29.705 --> 19:34.342
The worst criminal
in <i> N-Y-C</i>

19:34.376 --> 19:36.094
Oh, my God, are you okay?

19:36.128 --> 19:37.578
That was awesome.

19:37.596 --> 19:40.632
- You were so fast and strong.
- Thank you, Lemon.

19:40.683 --> 19:42.417
You're the only woman
I could ever fight

19:42.451 --> 19:43.751
to regain my manhood.

19:47.156 --> 19:49.557
They're cheering you
for stopping me.

19:49.591 --> 19:53.361
Old Liz was right.
People do want rules!

19:53.395 --> 19:54.862
There's good
in all of us, Lemon.

19:54.897 --> 19:56.130
Even you.

19:56.165 --> 19:57.649
So, are you still
running for mayor?

19:57.700 --> 20:01.319
The city no longer needs me.

20:01.370 --> 20:03.805
For now.

20:10.980 --> 20:12.747
Reminds me of us.

20:12.781 --> 20:15.583
I'll never forget the first time
you dressed up like and old lady

20:15.617 --> 20:17.518
and I threw you
into some garbage.

20:17.553 --> 20:20.221
Good-bye, my love.

20:20.255 --> 20:21.255
For now.

20:29.481 --> 20:30.999
New York City.

20:31.033 --> 20:33.101
Villains and heroes.

20:33.135 --> 20:35.620
The 1% and the 99.

20:35.654 --> 20:38.623
8 million people in this crazy,
beautiful city,

20:38.657 --> 20:40.641
and I, Jenna Maroney,

20:40.676 --> 20:43.344
am going to go to town
on every last one of them.
