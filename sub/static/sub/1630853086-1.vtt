01:01.131 --> 01:03.734
Round about
the cauldron go,

01:03.768 --> 01:07.438
in the poisoned entrails throw.

01:07.472 --> 01:10.340
Sweltered venom, sleeping got,

01:10.373 --> 01:13.343
boil it first in
charmed pot.

01:13.376 --> 01:17.515
Double double
toil and trouble.

01:17.548 --> 01:20.250
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.652
He's here.

02:58.252 --> 02:59.253
Olivia.

03:05.761 --> 03:06.629
He's here, sweetheart.

03:10.365 --> 03:11.634
Oh wait, one sec.

03:28.752 --> 03:30.152
You okay?

03:30.186 --> 03:31.521
Yeah.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.392
Here we go.

03:39.295 --> 03:40.664
Like he'll notice.

03:40.697 --> 03:41.865
- You ready?
- Mmhmm.

03:41.898 --> 03:43.265
Oh sweetie, don't
forget to breathe!

03:44.801 --> 03:45.569
Oh!

03:45.602 --> 03:47.872
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

03:50.675 --> 03:51.709
Breathe.

03:53.878 --> 03:54.712
Oh!

03:59.851 --> 04:02.754
Oh you promised me this is
the last time, sweetheart.

04:02.787 --> 04:03.655
An addict's promise
ain't worth shit.

04:03.688 --> 04:05.322
You know that.

04:05.355 --> 04:06.524
Oh, come on.

04:08.693 --> 04:09.894
Hi. Mike, right?

04:09.927 --> 04:11.228
Yes.

04:11.261 --> 04:12.397
I've got to go.

04:12.431 --> 04:13.699
Check in soon.

04:13.732 --> 04:14.833
Like we said on the phone,

04:14.867 --> 04:17.334
don't let him
out of your sight.

04:17.368 --> 04:19.237
These first few days
can be very delicate.

04:19.269 --> 04:20.505
Don't give him any money.

04:20.539 --> 04:22.340
Make sure he shows
up for the I.O.P.

04:23.642 --> 04:24.710
Oh, okay.

04:24.743 --> 04:25.744
Okay. It'll be great.

04:25.778 --> 04:26.679
Oh, thank you.

04:26.712 --> 04:27.913
Thanks for everything.

04:27.946 --> 04:28.847
Thank you, Mike.

04:28.881 --> 04:30.314
- We'll see you again, right?
- Absolutely.

04:30.348 --> 04:31.750
- Thank you, bud.
- Of course.

04:36.756 --> 04:38.758
Okay. Okay. Come on.

04:38.792 --> 04:39.859
Okay, okay, okay.

04:39.893 --> 04:42.462
Oh my god, you look so good.

04:53.773 --> 04:54.674
Pop.

05:00.313 --> 05:02.817
You know, I think he would
have liked my last album.

05:02.850 --> 05:06.487
Oh, he would have
loved them all.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.956
We got our son back, Raffy.

05:08.989 --> 05:09.790
Yeah. I don't know.

05:09.824 --> 05:11.559
I don't think he's, uh,

05:11.592 --> 05:12.593
listening from up there.

05:12.626 --> 05:13.894
I think it's kind of a,

05:13.928 --> 05:16.564
eh, Pops how's the
party going down there?

05:20.333 --> 05:20.968
Ah.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.373
So I, uh...

05:32.447 --> 05:33.280
she's pregnant.

05:34.516 --> 05:35.717
What?

05:35.751 --> 05:36.618
You don't like it.

05:36.651 --> 05:37.853
No I...

05:37.886 --> 05:39.755
It's, it's beautiful.

05:39.788 --> 05:40.822
It's gorgeous.

05:44.059 --> 05:46.895
I know what I'm doing, Mom.

05:46.928 --> 05:48.330
I am thrilled,

05:49.499 --> 05:50.332
for both of you.

05:57.974 --> 05:59.776
I thought they
canceled the tour.

05:59.809 --> 06:00.877
Hmm?

06:00.910 --> 06:01.878
They did.

06:01.911 --> 06:02.745
What's that?

06:02.779 --> 06:03.713
Curtis.

06:04.881 --> 06:05.748
That's a full page ad.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.349
It costs a lot of money.

06:07.382 --> 06:08.484
I don't know.

06:08.518 --> 06:09.552
Well, is there something
in your contract

06:09.585 --> 06:13.757
- obligating you to do the...
- No, no. It's fine.

06:14.191 --> 06:14.825
Don't worry about it.

06:14.858 --> 06:16.292
I'll take care of it, okay?

06:17.594 --> 06:18.428
Don't worry.

06:25.936 --> 06:27.838
Where are you going with
my crossword puzzle?

06:44.122 --> 06:45.590
Oh! Watch out.

06:46.858 --> 06:47.926
Hey.

06:47.959 --> 06:48.860
Yeah, hi.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.613
<i>I want it.</i>

07:07.646 --> 07:09.782
<i>I want it. I
want it really bad.</i>

07:09.815 --> 07:10.883
<i>Really, really bad.</i>

07:17.423 --> 07:18.757
Oh, Curtis.

07:18.791 --> 07:19.758
Honestly.

07:21.794 --> 07:22.995
You got to smoke?

07:23.028 --> 07:24.931
Use an ash tray, please.

07:28.034 --> 07:31.137
One vice at a time, Mom.

07:31.171 --> 07:32.806
One vice at a time.

07:39.145 --> 07:41.748
...<i>not if you screw up</i>
<i>this Goddamn audition.</i>

09:06.236 --> 09:08.806
I'm sorry you had to see that.

09:08.839 --> 09:09.907
Don't apologize to me.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.175
Apologize to your guitar.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.911
And you may have
hurt an old friend.

09:15.713 --> 09:17.114
Benny's not my friend. Okay?

09:17.147 --> 09:18.882
He's my manager.

09:18.916 --> 09:20.884
He's always just
been my manager.

09:20.918 --> 09:23.087
Since when? What?

09:23.755 --> 09:25.190
And Ronin? You're
screaming at...

09:27.225 --> 09:29.094
Baby, what happened in there?

09:30.562 --> 09:32.564
I don't think I can...

09:33.398 --> 09:36.067
I can't go back in
that world right now.

09:36.101 --> 09:36.935
I can't.

09:40.572 --> 09:41.940
It's not for me.

09:41.973 --> 09:43.975
It's okay, sweetheart.

09:48.147 --> 09:49.115
I'm sorry.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.036
Curtis?

10:11.203 --> 10:12.039
Sweetie?

10:14.041 --> 10:14.908
Oh!

10:14.941 --> 10:16.176
Curtis!

10:16.209 --> 10:17.344
No, no, no.

10:17.377 --> 10:18.745
Oh!

10:18.779 --> 10:20.147
Oh my God.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.048
Fuck.

10:22.015 --> 10:23.283
You scared the shit out of me.

10:24.452 --> 10:27.020
You scared the
shit out of <i>me.</i>

10:27.054 --> 10:27.888
Oh my God.

10:28.855 --> 10:29.990
Where's Olivia?

10:30.657 --> 10:31.925
Olivia's working late tonight,

10:31.958 --> 10:33.293
so I was just...

10:33.326 --> 10:35.262
I was just working
on some stuff.

10:35.295 --> 10:37.198
Mom, you've got to start...

10:37.231 --> 10:39.067
you've got to start trusting
me at some point, okay?

10:40.101 --> 10:40.935
You hungry?

10:42.136 --> 10:43.137
I got Chinese.

10:45.973 --> 10:46.808
Fuck.

10:47.208 --> 10:49.644
Give your mother
a heart attack.

10:52.947 --> 10:55.116
I had laid
the daggers ready.

10:55.149 --> 10:56.784
He could not
have missed them.

10:59.655 --> 11:01.223
I'm afraid they have awakened,

11:01.256 --> 11:03.358
and 'tis not done.

11:03.392 --> 11:07.329
The attempt, and not the
deed, must confound us.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.068
Had he not resembled
my father as he slept,

11:13.102 --> 11:14.103
I'd have done it.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.908
I have done the deed.

11:19.942 --> 11:21.310
This is a sorry sight.

11:21.343 --> 11:25.949
And a foolish thought,
to say a sorry sight.

11:25.982 --> 11:28.952
These deeds must not be
thought of after these ways.

11:28.985 --> 11:32.021
So, it will make us mad.

11:33.289 --> 11:36.693
Romantic attachments can
make things complicated.

11:37.694 --> 11:39.696
She's giving him
a reason to live

11:39.729 --> 11:42.065
and I could not have done
any of it without Olivia.

11:42.098 --> 11:42.899
It was very nice.

11:42.932 --> 11:44.100
And I hope that
they get very close.

11:44.134 --> 11:45.335
Well...

11:45.368 --> 11:47.872
But you know what they do say
about girlfriends and moms?

11:47.905 --> 11:50.174
Like oil and water.

11:50.207 --> 11:54.145
It's the truth. I'm
just saying, it...

11:54.178 --> 11:55.913
Hey, could you
pass that powder?

11:58.749 --> 12:00.151
You know, I actually feel
kind of like her mom now too.

12:00.184 --> 12:01.785
You know?

12:01.819 --> 12:03.954
She doesn't have any one.
Her parents both died.

12:04.822 --> 12:05.723
She's a nurse?

12:06.491 --> 12:07.892
What about it, Mona?

12:07.925 --> 12:09.226
It's perfect.

12:09.260 --> 12:13.832
Yeah. But she does have
access to pharmaceuticals.

12:13.865 --> 12:15.934
Oh, good point.

13:23.505 --> 13:25.273
Were you
the first responder?

13:25.306 --> 13:26.475
Yes, sir.

13:26.508 --> 13:28.243
Sponsor stopped by
and found two bodies.

13:28.276 --> 13:29.911
Curtis Cooper and...

13:29.944 --> 13:31.045
Olivia Jones.

13:34.082 --> 13:36.351
No bruises.

13:39.287 --> 13:41.356
Where's our rock star?

13:41.389 --> 13:42.458
Right over here.

13:45.159 --> 13:45.893
You know his music?

13:45.927 --> 13:47.329
What did he play?

13:47.363 --> 13:48.264
He was a singer.

13:48.297 --> 13:52.067
He had a big hit like
three summers ago.

13:52.101 --> 13:52.901
You know?

13:53.536 --> 13:55.237
Oh yeah.

13:55.271 --> 13:56.439
I kind of recognize him.

13:56.473 --> 13:58.274
Right?

13:58.307 --> 14:00.009
No bruises here either.

14:21.264 --> 14:22.299
I'm sorry.

14:22.332 --> 14:25.201
You're saying you think
his death was accidental?

14:25.770 --> 14:27.237
I'm sorry to say, but yes.

14:27.270 --> 14:28.271
That's how it looks.

14:29.205 --> 14:32.309
Now, did you have any indication
that he was using again?

14:32.342 --> 14:33.943
Any signs?

14:33.977 --> 14:35.379
No.

14:35.413 --> 14:36.914
No, quite the contrary.

14:36.947 --> 14:39.618
No, no, no changes in his
behavior and his mood?

14:39.651 --> 14:41.352
Detective. I don't
know if you're aware,

14:41.385 --> 14:45.256
but my son recently returned
from a very serious rehab.

14:45.289 --> 14:46.924
Yes. Ma'am I am aware
about a month ago.

14:46.957 --> 14:47.559
Yes?

14:47.592 --> 14:49.360
It just...

14:49.393 --> 14:51.295
I got my boy back, huh?

14:54.432 --> 14:55.600
Last night.

14:55.634 --> 14:58.869
Last night of all
nights. It just. He...

14:58.903 --> 15:00.473
Why is that?

15:00.506 --> 15:02.475
Because he was
about the propose?

15:02.508 --> 15:05.844
Well, yes. But,
but more than that,

15:07.245 --> 15:09.381
oh, he and Olivia were
starting a life together.

15:09.414 --> 15:11.083
And she's pregnant.

15:11.116 --> 15:13.553
Is it possible that they may
have wanted to celebrate?

15:15.555 --> 15:19.257
No, no. Not like that.

15:19.291 --> 15:21.259
Olivia is a nurse. She...

15:23.429 --> 15:24.531
Was.

15:24.565 --> 15:28.000
I know this can be very
difficult to hear Mrs. Cooper,

15:29.435 --> 15:32.138
but we found traces of a
very powerful amphetamine

15:32.171 --> 15:33.406
in both their systems.

15:35.007 --> 15:36.275
How can you explain that?

15:40.313 --> 15:42.449
You want me to figure that out?

15:45.586 --> 15:48.021
I'm very sorry for your loss.

15:48.055 --> 15:49.356
I'll be in touch.

16:20.623 --> 16:23.224
<i>I fear thy nature.</i>

16:23.258 --> 16:26.361
<i>It is too full of the
milk of human kindness.</i>

16:29.532 --> 16:32.535
<i>Be not lost so poorly
in your thoughts.</i>

16:49.686 --> 16:51.488
Hey guys, can I, uh...

16:51.521 --> 16:53.022
talk to you three for a minute?

16:54.223 --> 16:55.559
Of course, Lillian.

16:59.396 --> 17:01.965
We all owe Curtis and
massive gratitude, Lillian.

17:05.135 --> 17:08.638
Not only for his music,
but for his friendship.

17:10.508 --> 17:12.142
I know y'all got high together.

17:14.310 --> 17:16.580
No, I'm not blaming anyone.

17:16.614 --> 17:21.084
I just, if Curtis was
going to use again,

17:22.653 --> 17:23.555
who would he call?

17:26.057 --> 17:27.425
Billy, you must know.

17:27.459 --> 17:29.427
Isn't that one of
the jobs of the manager?

17:30.428 --> 17:32.498
Lillian, I can understand
why you might think that,

17:32.531 --> 17:34.131
but no.

17:34.165 --> 17:36.033
I've been handling the fallout
from the canceled tour.

17:36.067 --> 17:38.336
I have lawsuits
coming in every day.

17:38.369 --> 17:40.238
I haven't spoken to him.

17:40.271 --> 17:41.239
I haven't seen him.

17:41.439 --> 17:43.040
No, before that.

17:43.942 --> 17:47.079
I've been setting up this tour
for the past year, Lillian.

17:47.112 --> 17:50.115
Coordinating with the
record label, promoters,

17:50.148 --> 17:51.283
merchandise vendors,

17:51.316 --> 17:54.454
people that handle
social media, branding.

17:54.487 --> 17:56.154
I don't have time, Lillian.

17:57.289 --> 17:58.123
Ronin.

17:59.324 --> 18:02.294
You are going to write the
name and number of his dealer

18:02.327 --> 18:04.497
on this, for me.

18:04.531 --> 18:05.598
Please.

18:07.399 --> 18:08.568
Curtis was a private guy.

18:12.806 --> 18:16.042
Ronin, on the day of my
son's funeral. Please.

18:20.548 --> 18:21.715
Dealer's name is Taz.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.754
Thank you, Ronin.

18:26.787 --> 18:27.621
Thank you.

substitute for another drug,</i>

19:03.926 --> 19:05.728
<i>more popular ecstasy.</i>

19:05.761 --> 19:08.598
<i>PMA is cheaper and
has similar effects,</i>

19:08.631 --> 19:11.734
<i>but it's more toxic so it
can kill in much lower doses.</i>

19:23.780 --> 19:24.615
Taz?

19:26.516 --> 19:27.818
You're a girl.

19:27.851 --> 19:28.652
So are you.

19:28.685 --> 19:29.620
No, I...

19:29.653 --> 19:30.654
Get in.

19:38.595 --> 19:39.496
What are you in to?

19:39.529 --> 19:40.363
PMA.

19:42.666 --> 19:45.234
Something tells me that's
not really your flavor.

19:45.869 --> 19:46.837
Are you a cop?

19:46.871 --> 19:49.239
No. Just a concerned citizen.

19:50.575 --> 19:54.646
Actually, I'm Curtis
Cooper's mother.

19:57.982 --> 20:00.585
- Shit.
- Mmm.

20:00.618 --> 20:02.285
I'm really sorry for your loss.

20:04.656 --> 20:05.823
Um,

20:07.892 --> 20:10.227
this is a very
sensitive subject.

20:10.260 --> 20:12.665
So I'm going to need you
to get out of my car,

20:12.698 --> 20:17.569
At any time,
before my son died,

20:17.603 --> 20:20.673
did you speak with him?

20:20.706 --> 20:22.240
I said get the
fuck out of my car.

20:22.273 --> 20:24.175
It's a simple yes or no.

20:26.411 --> 20:27.780
Yes. Or no?

20:30.415 --> 20:31.950
I heard Curtis dried out.

20:31.984 --> 20:33.652
I hadn't talked
to him in months.

20:35.588 --> 20:37.757
Look, I've got rules, okay?

20:37.791 --> 20:39.959
I never saw anyone
fresh out of clean up.

20:39.993 --> 20:40.827
Too much fallout.

20:40.860 --> 20:41.795
Too many OD's.

20:41.828 --> 20:43.395
And I never move PMA.

20:48.868 --> 20:51.838
Like I said, I'm really
sorry for your loss.

20:51.871 --> 20:54.708
But if I have to say get
to fuck out of my car

20:54.741 --> 20:56.643
one more time...

20:59.580 --> 21:00.548
Thank you,

21:01.347 --> 21:03.316
Miss Taz.

21:23.972 --> 21:25.507
Babe.

21:27.809 --> 21:28.877
Babe!

21:43.024 --> 21:43.859
Ah!

22:34.846 --> 22:36.681
Lady Macbeth.

22:38.950 --> 22:39.751
Cleopatra.

22:41.619 --> 22:43.988
Esther Prenn from
the Scarlet Letter.

22:44.022 --> 22:45.422
That A gives her away.

22:46.858 --> 22:47.826
Medea....

22:49.127 --> 22:52.463
The Deathly Light. I
don't know that one.

22:52.497 --> 22:53.298
What's that?

22:53.330 --> 22:56.067
Yeah. It's a play
loosely based on

22:56.100 --> 22:58.036
an Edgar Allan Poe short story.

22:59.505 --> 23:00.906
Poe always gave me the creeps.

23:01.874 --> 23:04.342
Is there a role you haven't
played you'd like to?

23:05.711 --> 23:06.812
Portia.

23:07.012 --> 23:07.847
Portia.

23:08.981 --> 23:10.783
She swallows fire.

23:10.816 --> 23:12.450
Ooh.

23:12.484 --> 23:14.887
She eats hot coals and
burns from the inside.

23:17.756 --> 23:19.959
And how would you
show that on stage?

23:19.992 --> 23:21.660
Oh, well usually it's not shown,

23:21.694 --> 23:23.763
but I'm actually
talking about, you know,

23:24.564 --> 23:27.734
telling the historical
truth of Portia,

23:27.767 --> 23:29.636
a woman who would
do such a thing.

23:29.669 --> 23:30.737
Wow.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.873
I don't know if I
can find a writer.

23:36.042 --> 23:38.511
Mm. Very good.

23:41.014 --> 23:41.915
You know you committed a felony

23:41.948 --> 23:44.084
when you got into the
drug dealer's car?

23:44.117 --> 23:47.420
It's illegal to be in a motor
vehicle containing contraband.

23:48.421 --> 23:51.726
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

23:51.759 --> 23:54.595
And I was able to get
in touch with a person

23:54.629 --> 23:57.131
that sold my son
drugs in the past.

23:57.164 --> 23:59.000
I wouldn't take
a criminal's word,

23:59.033 --> 23:59.967
for anything.

24:00.835 --> 24:02.803
I think I can tell when
somebody is telling me

24:02.837 --> 24:04.772
the truth or not, Detective.

24:04.805 --> 24:06.007
That is my job.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.876
And what do you think
my job is Mrs. Cooper?

24:08.910 --> 24:11.847
Don't play detective.
We have the lab results.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.447
We know what happened.

24:13.482 --> 24:16.919
And you really think it's
just as simple as all that?

24:16.952 --> 24:20.055
You're not alone in
what you're feeling.

24:20.088 --> 24:21.890
A lot of parents have
gone through this.

24:21.924 --> 24:23.025
I see it all the time.

24:23.825 --> 24:26.094
So, just business
as usual for you?

24:26.128 --> 24:28.897
No, no. Look.

24:30.198 --> 24:33.001
Curtis may have gotten a
hold of some bad stuff.

24:33.035 --> 24:35.138
He may have had a bad reaction.

24:35.171 --> 24:38.041
I wish to hell that wasn't
the case, but it is.

24:38.808 --> 24:40.910
Don't you think that
there's just a...

24:42.178 --> 24:43.913
tiniest possibility

24:43.947 --> 24:48.918
that somebody set them up to
make it look like an overdose?

24:48.952 --> 24:50.019
No. No.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.688
There's just no
evidence of that.

24:52.188 --> 24:54.857
The case is closed
Mrs. Cooper.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.929
Now, our guy's out of there.

24:58.963 --> 25:00.931
You can do with the
apartment whatever you want.

25:02.132 --> 25:06.003
Now promise me you won't go
talking to any more drug dealers

25:06.036 --> 25:07.137
or anything like that.

25:20.784 --> 25:22.754
Lil, are you okay to do this?

25:22.787 --> 25:24.189
Yeah.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.857
Yeah, I'll be fine.

25:26.725 --> 25:27.892
You know, I can stay.

25:29.728 --> 25:30.962
That's okay. I'm really, I...

25:30.996 --> 25:32.697
I'll stay a little bit.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.532
You don't need to. I thank
you so much for your help.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.134
You don't need to thank me.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.236
I'm going to make us coffee.
Is there coffee here?

25:38.269 --> 25:39.371
I don't know if there is any.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.573
I am going to go out and
I'm going to get us coffee.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.575
How's that? Okay? Yeah.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.710
You need a little pick me up.

25:45.744 --> 25:46.779
That's what I'm going to do.

25:46.812 --> 25:47.947
I'll be right back.

27:27.117 --> 27:29.752
I got a little
something for you.

27:29.786 --> 27:31.254
For me?

27:31.287 --> 27:32.088
Why?

27:32.122 --> 27:33.957
Well, it's not
exactly for you, but

27:39.229 --> 27:41.231
I hope it's okay.

27:41.264 --> 27:43.333
Oh my God.

27:43.366 --> 27:44.667
Lillian.

27:44.701 --> 27:46.035
I just couldn't resist.

27:47.138 --> 27:48.839
It's so adorable.

27:52.243 --> 27:53.210
- Are you expecting someone?
- MmMmm.

27:56.147 --> 27:57.081
You get it.

28:02.319 --> 28:03.154
Lilly.

28:07.324 --> 28:09.026
Are you all right?

28:10.496 --> 28:11.429
No.

28:13.098 --> 28:14.099
No, I'm not.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.791
Ms. Cooper, thanks again
so much for coming by.

28:38.824 --> 28:40.793
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the service.

28:40.826 --> 28:43.029
I was traveling. I hope
you got the flowers.

28:44.063 --> 28:48.734
This is your idea of how
to exploit my son's death?

28:48.768 --> 28:52.872
Exploiting is not
what we're about.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.740
We want to do right by Curtis.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.142
The tribute album

28:56.175 --> 28:58.144
and the memorial
concert, it's a...

29:00.047 --> 29:01.281
to honor your boy's memory.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.319
We want to make sure we
pick the best images.

29:05.352 --> 29:08.155
This label's like,
like a family.

29:08.188 --> 29:11.258
You know, every
artist matters to us.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.960
The truth is you
could put me back

29:12.993 --> 29:15.262
in my old studio apartment
with nothing, but you know,

29:15.295 --> 29:17.831
a view of a brick wall.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.368
As long as I had my records.

29:21.401 --> 29:23.338
That's what it's about.

29:29.043 --> 29:30.378
That's why this record
is so important.

29:30.411 --> 29:35.049
And that's why I insisted
on having your input

29:35.083 --> 29:36.117
as his mother.

29:36.150 --> 29:40.489
I imagine actually you
need my input as his mother

29:40.522 --> 29:42.491
for the approval of
his likeness, right?

29:42.524 --> 29:44.926
Well, I mean, we
don't need it <i>per se.</i>

29:44.959 --> 29:47.196
It's, we could go in
another direction,

29:48.964 --> 29:51.267
but a photo of your boy
would be a nice thing.

29:58.073 --> 29:59.174
And you know, Curtis
is going to be

29:59.208 --> 30:02.144
a bigger star now than
ever before.

30:02.177 --> 30:04.213
What makes you think
I care about that?

30:05.447 --> 30:06.483
Because his talent...

30:08.183 --> 30:09.418
I mean, he had the kind
of talent that deserves

30:09.451 --> 30:11.288
to be remembered forever.

30:20.430 --> 30:21.298
Not bad.

30:22.198 --> 30:24.067
This is, this is my boy.

30:27.037 --> 30:28.104
I like that one.

30:31.107 --> 30:32.275
What's the matter?

30:37.214 --> 30:39.850
Do you know this photographer?

30:42.053 --> 30:45.590
That is from the Dangerous
Star photo shoot.

30:45.624 --> 30:49.026
So I'm not sure.

30:49.060 --> 30:50.995
I like, I like that one.

30:51.028 --> 30:53.164
Do you want... is that the
one you want to go with?

30:53.197 --> 30:54.633
Uh, yeah.

30:54.666 --> 30:55.399
Yeah. This one.

30:55.433 --> 30:56.501
I love it.

31:28.334 --> 31:30.403
Great.

31:31.037 --> 31:31.871
Perfect.

31:33.272 --> 31:35.108
Uh, too much.

31:35.141 --> 31:37.076
Little, three quarters.

31:37.110 --> 31:38.378
Oh yeah. That's nice.

31:38.411 --> 31:39.479
This is good.

31:42.248 --> 31:43.082
Hi.

31:44.618 --> 31:46.085
Hi.

31:46.119 --> 31:48.523
I'm sorry guys. I have a guest.

31:48.556 --> 31:50.391
I'll, uh, just give me a minute.

31:52.527 --> 31:56.463
So, uh, what brings you over?

31:56.498 --> 32:00.033
Well, I understand you
shot photos of my son

32:00.067 --> 32:01.001
for his album,

32:01.034 --> 32:02.369
and I wonder why you
didn't tell me that.

32:02.403 --> 32:03.671
What was I going to say?

32:05.740 --> 32:07.107
You could have told
me you knew him

32:07.141 --> 32:09.577
in a different
context than the...

32:09.611 --> 32:11.514
Well, he didn't use my photo.

32:11.547 --> 32:14.015
Why did you really come here?

32:14.048 --> 32:16.351
To apologize for the whole

32:16.384 --> 32:18.587
knife in my car thing?

32:18.621 --> 32:22.090
No, actually I came to
see if you could help me.

32:22.123 --> 32:24.359
Look, I know you're
not responsible

32:24.392 --> 32:26.729
for the death of my son,

32:26.762 --> 32:28.997
but you did supply him
along the way, right?

32:29.665 --> 32:33.268
So what, what do you need?

32:33.301 --> 32:34.303
Information.

32:35.539 --> 32:39.175
I don't dispense
info for anyone.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.511
That's kind of a major tenant
for staying in business.

32:41.812 --> 32:42.945
I understand. I do.

32:43.713 --> 32:45.347
They're using your photo now.

32:46.282 --> 32:47.116
Geez.

32:49.084 --> 32:50.587
Wow.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.122
I just never imagined
my photo would end up

32:53.155 --> 32:54.423
on an album cover like this.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.428
That's a beautiful
picture of him.

32:58.462 --> 33:00.163
A side rarely seen, I mean,

33:00.665 --> 33:01.398
and you captured it.

33:01.431 --> 33:04.301
Maybe you brought
it out in him.

33:05.068 --> 33:07.204
Taz, don't tell me
you don't give a shit.

33:08.138 --> 33:09.473
What would you like me to say?

33:09.507 --> 33:10.307
I liked him a lot.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.542
We had fun. Okay.

33:11.576 --> 33:14.411
I'm sorry. I feel
really fucking shitty

33:14.444 --> 33:16.012
about everything
that happened.

33:19.517 --> 33:22.521
I have other photos
from this shoot

33:22.554 --> 33:24.288
of Curtis and the band.

33:25.624 --> 33:26.625
If you want to see them.

33:29.260 --> 33:30.596
Oh my God. I've known that boy

33:30.629 --> 33:32.698
since he was a
little tiny thing.

33:32.731 --> 33:35.233
Billy. Billy knew my
husband back when.

33:39.838 --> 33:41.272
Oh my God, that guitar.

33:42.173 --> 33:45.176
He loved that pattern
in grade school.

33:45.209 --> 33:48.113
He got a pair of sneakers with
spots on them like a cheetah.

33:48.146 --> 33:50.148
He thought it would
make him run faster.

33:55.087 --> 33:56.188
Do you, um.

33:56.221 --> 33:57.289
Oh, no thank you.

34:00.660 --> 34:03.028
When did you say
these were taken?

34:03.362 --> 34:04.597
Two years ago.

34:05.397 --> 34:08.668
Could you print up a copy of
this one for me too, please?

34:08.701 --> 34:09.502
Of course.

34:16.610 --> 34:18.077
So you're going to help me?

34:19.045 --> 34:22.850
I stayed so far away
from all of that shit,

34:22.882 --> 34:26.085
and I have very
high-end clientele,

34:26.119 --> 34:30.491
and I don't need them
croaking on me for some

34:31.592 --> 34:33.458
bad PMA.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.362
You don't grow your
own pot or mushrooms?

34:36.397 --> 34:38.699
You don't have a cocoa
plant in the closet, right?

34:39.900 --> 34:41.570
Of course not,
you have suppliers,

34:41.603 --> 34:45.371
and surely someone knows how
PMA moves through the city.

34:45.406 --> 34:49.109
Sniffing around can get
me really up fucked up.

34:49.143 --> 34:52.446
Just ask me any other favor.

34:52.478 --> 34:53.514
No, I'm not asking.

34:55.215 --> 34:57.752

I hate playing concerts,
to tell you the truth.

35:59.717 --> 36:01.753
You're in a rock band.

36:01.786 --> 36:02.620
I prefer recording.

36:03.788 --> 36:04.722
I like the studio life.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.727
I talked to that Taz.

36:09.761 --> 36:12.363
I was surprised
to learn that she

36:12.397 --> 36:13.832
is actually a
decent photographer.

36:14.967 --> 36:18.771
And you knew
Olivia pretty well.

36:26.545 --> 36:30.649
I don't know why they
wouldn't have told you.

36:30.683 --> 36:32.250
Maybe they felt guilty.

36:33.686 --> 36:36.455
They were seeing each
other for a full year

36:36.488 --> 36:37.624
while we were together.

36:38.892 --> 36:40.627
Must've upset you?

36:41.695 --> 36:42.729
Yeah.

36:43.797 --> 36:45.899
You know, I was no angel either.

36:45.932 --> 36:46.900
Especially on tour.

36:48.434 --> 36:49.803
Where the problems began.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.841
I got to get back.

36:55.975 --> 36:58.779
Ronin. Did Olivia ever use?

37:02.516 --> 37:03.617
I really don't know.

37:05.686 --> 37:08.288
I'm about to play a
song I wrote for Curtis.

37:08.321 --> 37:10.457
I'm still working on it,

37:10.490 --> 37:12.693
but I want it to be
ready for the memorial.

37:14.294 --> 37:15.863
Want to hear it?

37:15.896 --> 37:16.864
No. I don't.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.900
Yeah. Just don't
make me regret it.

38:55.934 --> 38:59.404
Oh, I really
appreciate it. Really.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.414
Those are the three guys who
move PMA through the city.

39:19.892 --> 39:22.361
So what are you going to do?

39:25.098 --> 39:26.566
I don't know.

40:08.809 --> 40:12.413
Add just a splash of water
once every week to 10 days.

40:14.149 --> 40:17.019
Now these can get to root
rot as quick as look at you,

40:17.052 --> 40:20.656
if you sit in soggy soil,
even for short periods.

40:20.689 --> 40:21.523
Can I help you?

40:22.257 --> 40:23.091
Just looking.

40:25.627 --> 40:27.195
Do you have a pit?

40:27.229 --> 40:30.232
This can be toxic to animals
if they eat the leaves.

40:30.265 --> 40:31.800
So make sure they don't...

40:32.968 --> 40:33.836
Put it up off the floor,

40:33.870 --> 40:35.171
keep it up on the
table, for example.

40:35.204 --> 40:36.940
So the dogs and cats
don't get to it.

40:36.973 --> 40:39.575
I want you to know this
label is like family.

40:39.609 --> 40:41.476
You know, every artist matters.

40:41.511 --> 40:44.881
Curtis is going to be a bigger
star now than ever before.

40:48.051 --> 40:51.054
<i>Look like
the innocent flower,</i>

40:51.087 --> 40:52.989
<i>but be the serpent underneath.</i>

40:55.959 --> 40:58.162
...and no water. Just in
about four or five days,

40:58.195 --> 41:00.698
just a little splash around
the outside of the pot.

41:19.316 --> 41:20.818
Fuck.

41:50.116 --> 41:51.717
For fuck's sake.

41:54.987 --> 41:57.089
You better fucking answer
my calls, little man.

41:58.090 --> 41:59.792
The yellow brick road
doesn't lead to Oz, mate.

41:59.825 --> 42:00.793
It leads to me.

42:01.360 --> 42:04.063
I'm the bloody wizard and we
have a major fucking emergency.

42:54.982 --> 42:57.285
Lillian Cooper calling
Detective Eaton, please.

43:02.157 --> 43:05.894
No, please, please
don't put me on hold.

43:05.928 --> 43:07.129
Well, this is the third time

43:07.162 --> 43:09.131
I've left a message for
Detective Eaton, so.

43:10.399 --> 43:12.167
Yes, Lillian Cooper.

43:12.201 --> 43:14.736
I'm sure the detective
will know what it's about.

43:17.072 --> 43:17.906
Thank you.

43:32.755 --> 43:37.260
<i>Revenge his
foul, unnatural murder.</i>

43:38.261 --> 43:39.295
<i>Leave...</i>

43:39.329 --> 43:41.231
<i>not one...</i>

43:41.865 --> 43:43.233

43:50.141 --> 43:54.345
♪ Like a captain, we're found ♪

43:54.378 --> 43:57.081
They say Elvis is worth
more dead than alive.

43:58.015 --> 44:00.284
So sick fucks are making
a shit ton of money

44:00.317 --> 44:02.153
off Curtis's death.

44:02.186 --> 44:04.989
Yeah. Cops just don't
want to hear it.

44:05.022 --> 44:06.223
Now look at that
son of a bitch.

44:06.257 --> 44:07.224
Oh, God Look.

44:07.958 --> 44:10.795
That guy is really
fucking scary.

44:10.829 --> 44:12.397
They call him "The
Gardener" because...

44:14.466 --> 44:17.068
he slit a guy's throat
with gardening tools.

44:20.005 --> 44:21.840
<i>If you're
really going to do this...</i>

44:28.013 --> 44:31.116
<i>Death is the only water
to wash away this dirt.</i>

44:34.187 --> 44:36.289
Where did you get your gun?

44:36.322 --> 44:37.323
What?

44:37.356 --> 44:39.825
Your gun. Where did you get it?

44:39.859 --> 44:42.361
I got it for protection.

44:43.996 --> 44:46.265
Look having a gun isn't
always such a clever idea.

44:46.299 --> 44:48.267
You go waltzing around
these sketch balls

44:48.301 --> 44:50.169
and bad things are
bound to happen.

44:50.203 --> 44:52.738
Bad things have
already happened.

44:52.772 --> 44:53.940
What do you want me to do?

44:53.973 --> 44:55.308
Go dig around on
Craigslist? I will.

44:57.343 --> 44:59.313
These three assholes
have to pay.

45:00.847 --> 45:03.083
But it's still not
going to bring him back.

45:04.952 --> 45:06.186
But justice will be served.

45:38.920 --> 45:41.289
Don't spoil your appetite.

45:43.358 --> 45:46.195
Hey, just don't go without this.

45:49.965 --> 45:51.100
Active ingredients.

46:27.370 --> 46:28.938
You were just amazing.

46:28.972 --> 46:30.407
And when you kicked
that cop in the nuts.

46:30.440 --> 46:33.109
"There's your blow job." I love
that. What movie was that?

46:33.143 --> 46:35.112
- Uh, Cookie.
- Your Medea was superb.

46:35.146 --> 46:36.047
- My what?
- Madea.

46:36.080 --> 46:38.115
I've never seen it
done quite like that.

46:38.149 --> 46:41.152
So "capital B Bitchy"
with a twist of Hepburn.

46:41.185 --> 46:42.320
Audrey of course.

46:42.353 --> 46:46.457
Oh yeah. And what
is the capacity?

46:46.490 --> 46:47.559
Uh, 95.

46:50.061 --> 46:52.430
Have you also directed before?

46:52.463 --> 46:54.131
Oh, well summers Coop and I

46:54.165 --> 46:56.267
up in Vermont,

46:56.300 --> 46:57.469
children's theater.

46:57.502 --> 46:58.503
I think I know what I'm doing.

46:58.538 --> 47:00.472
Of course you do.

47:02.140 --> 47:03.241
Trap door.

47:03.275 --> 47:05.477
Oh! Addie.

47:05.510 --> 47:07.346
I missed you so much.

47:08.513 --> 47:10.215
I think there's
a do very nicely.

47:10.248 --> 47:12.317
I greatly appreciate the help.

47:13.018 --> 47:14.386
So, this is
the emergency exit.

47:14.419 --> 47:15.921
In case the shit hits the fan.

47:15.954 --> 47:17.155
Goes right to the alley.

47:18.423 --> 47:20.459
Depending on the
size of the cast,

47:20.492 --> 47:22.328
we can usually provide
one or two senior members

47:22.362 --> 47:24.665
of the company with
their own private space.

47:24.698 --> 47:26.866
I gave up my space
once for Tony Danza.

47:29.068 --> 47:30.571
I'm assuming you want your own.

47:30.604 --> 47:32.238
A Tony spot would be great.

47:38.978 --> 47:40.980
Ah. Okay.

47:42.415 --> 47:45.084
It's our finest and
largest dressing room.

47:45.118 --> 47:46.920
I call it the
presidential suite.

47:46.954 --> 47:50.457
That vanity was a gift for
my mom on Julius Caesar.

47:50.491 --> 47:52.527
Oh, pardon me, thou
bleeding piece of earth

47:52.560 --> 47:55.496
that I am meek and gentle
with these butchers.

47:56.997 --> 47:59.299
That cot is special.

47:59.333 --> 48:00.467
It's where I get
all my beauty sleep.

48:00.501 --> 48:01.402
Not that you need any.

48:03.070 --> 48:05.305
I, well, it...

48:05.339 --> 48:07.508
It will be my last play.

48:07.542 --> 48:08.676
Don't say that.

48:08.710 --> 48:12.681
Every exit is an
entrance someplace else.

48:12.715 --> 48:13.549
What do you mean?

48:15.584 --> 48:19.487
Could you, um, give
me a moment here?

48:19.521 --> 48:22.157
Yes. If you need
anything, please.

48:53.456 --> 48:57.595
If thou didst ever
thy dear Mother, love.

49:01.732 --> 49:06.069
Revenge his foul,
unnatural murder.

49:09.607 --> 49:11.341
Fare thee well ones,

49:11.374 --> 49:13.678
the glowworm shows
the matin to be near,

49:15.345 --> 49:18.248
and 'gins to pale her
uneffectual fire.

49:18.281 --> 49:20.450
Adieu, sweet Hamlet.

49:20.484 --> 49:21.452
Adieu. Remember me!

51:16.237 --> 51:16.839
Oh.

51:16.872 --> 51:18.306
Shit.

51:18.340 --> 51:21.243
What the fuck are
you suppose to be?

51:23.547 --> 51:24.548
Oh fuck.

51:24.581 --> 51:25.281
The fuck is this?

51:25.314 --> 51:25.916
What do you want?

51:25.949 --> 51:27.851
I know what you did.

51:27.884 --> 51:29.686
What did I do, love?
What have I done?

51:29.720 --> 51:31.688
I want to know how you did it.

51:31.722 --> 51:34.725
Get your fucking PMA in my son.

51:35.491 --> 51:37.126
Fucking priceless.

51:38.662 --> 51:40.196
Mommy, dearest huh?

51:41.497 --> 51:42.599
But you're not going
to use that gun.

51:42.633 --> 51:45.202
You're not going
to use the gun.

51:45.235 --> 51:46.738
You don't know how to.

51:46.771 --> 51:47.872
Now give it to me.

51:47.905 --> 51:48.773
How'd you do it?

51:48.806 --> 51:50.642
You are not going to
use that fucking...

52:59.747 --> 53:01.982
Why don't
we try to schedule something

53:02.016 --> 53:03.818
once we get closer?

53:57.540 --> 53:58.741
Back on in two Mrs. Cooper.

54:01.778 --> 54:02.845
Ah!

54:23.801 --> 54:28.005
<i>That one may
smile, and smile vehemently.</i>

54:33.077 --> 54:34.946
Are you okay?

54:34.979 --> 54:36.080
Oh yeah.

54:36.114 --> 54:37.949
How do I look?

54:37.982 --> 54:38.783
Like a ghost.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.450
An award-winning ghost.

54:43.621 --> 54:45.824
The villain, the slave,
is not twentieth part,

54:45.857 --> 54:47.926
the tithe of your
precedent, Lord.

54:47.959 --> 54:48.793
No.

54:49.861 --> 54:53.530
A king of shreds and patches.

54:53.565 --> 54:55.967
Save me and hover o'er
me with your wings.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.971
Oh, heavenly guards.

54:59.004 --> 55:00.773
What would your
gracious figure?

55:03.175 --> 55:05.476
Alas. She smat.

55:05.510 --> 55:06.846
Do not forget.

55:06.879 --> 55:10.783
This visitation is but to whet

55:10.816 --> 55:13.886
thy almost blunted purpose.

55:13.919 --> 55:18.090
Oh, look amazement
on thy father sits,

55:18.123 --> 55:23.063
step between him and
his fighting soul.

55:24.731 --> 55:26.365
Speak to him, Hamlet.

55:39.445 --> 55:41.147
How you doing?

55:43.216 --> 55:44.651
Ah, great.

55:44.684 --> 55:45.953
What happened to your leg?

55:45.987 --> 55:48.923
Ah, nothing. I... sorry
about the shoe.

55:48.956 --> 55:50.024
I've always been a fan.

55:51.692 --> 55:52.827
You don't have to say that.

55:52.860 --> 55:53.861
I've always been a fan.

55:53.895 --> 55:55.129
If it happens again.

55:55.162 --> 55:58.431
What? The audience
got a kick out of it.

55:58.465 --> 55:59.867
Lillian Cooper is
a serious actress.

55:59.901 --> 56:01.569
A real tragedienne.

56:01.602 --> 56:03.004
Just because you're
the director doesn't

56:03.037 --> 56:05.039
mean you can change a
costume at your own whim.

56:05.072 --> 56:07.975
Hamlet is a tragedy,
not a fucking farce.

56:11.113 --> 56:12.714
I'm, It
won't happen...

57:17.581 --> 57:20.084
<i>If you're really
going to do this,</i>

57:21.753 --> 57:23.221
<i>do it courageously.</i>

57:24.990 --> 57:26.725
Do it gloriously.

57:28.693 --> 57:29.761
Do it right.

57:41.072 --> 57:42.974
Speak. I am bound to listen.

57:43.008 --> 57:45.277
As you are to revenge.

57:47.913 --> 57:49.248
I am thy mother's spirit.

57:50.616 --> 57:53.119
Doomed for a certain term

57:53.152 --> 57:54.020
to walk the night

57:56.956 --> 58:00.626
and for the day confined
to fast in fires

58:00.659 --> 58:05.097
'til the foul crimes done
in my days of nature,

58:06.165 --> 58:09.102
are burnt and purged away.

58:10.170 --> 58:12.572
Were I not forbid to tell

58:12.606 --> 58:15.876
the secrets of my prison house,

58:15.909 --> 58:20.013
I could a tale unfold
whose lightest word

58:21.782 --> 58:23.583
would harrow thy soul.

58:25.819 --> 58:30.757
If thou didst ever
thy dear mother love...

58:31.191 --> 58:31.892
Oh God.

58:32.359 --> 58:36.064
Revenge this foul,

58:36.097 --> 58:38.900
unnatural murder.

58:40.668 --> 58:41.836
Murder?

58:41.869 --> 58:42.937
Murder.

58:46.340 --> 58:48.142
You have that much talent.

58:49.944 --> 58:52.780
And I don't know how you could
just walk away from it all.

58:52.814 --> 58:54.248
I'll never understand it.

58:54.282 --> 58:56.050
Plaque went up pretty fast.

58:56.084 --> 58:58.320
Yeah. You getting a lot of
work off this masterpiece?

58:58.353 --> 59:01.190
That's a great picture, but
don't quit your day job.

59:01.223 --> 59:02.124
Night job.

59:02.157 --> 59:04.093
You have the best candy.

59:04.126 --> 59:06.028
I don't like being
left out in the cold.

59:07.029 --> 59:08.097
I'll keep that in mind.

59:11.400 --> 59:13.235
Every color in the rainbow.

59:13.268 --> 59:14.069
The usual.

59:18.173 --> 59:19.675
Always a pleasure
doing business.

59:19.708 --> 59:20.309
Likewise.

59:21.211 --> 59:22.112
Goodbye Claude.

59:25.748 --> 59:26.382
Hey!

01:00:27.746 --> 01:00:28.947
In the chest, you say?

01:00:30.282 --> 01:00:32.317
Yes, in the chest.

01:00:32.718 --> 01:00:34.253
What the fu...?

01:00:34.287 --> 01:00:35.922
Much lower actually,

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.158
below the stomach.

01:00:39.192 --> 01:00:41.160
Um, you've got the wrong guy.

01:00:44.497 --> 01:00:46.365
And now sir,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.870
I am going to shoot you.

01:00:55.374 --> 01:00:58.045
Do you think they'll make
a tribute album for you?

01:01:16.363 --> 01:01:18.298
Oh, there you are.

01:01:18.332 --> 01:01:19.166
I just knocked.

01:01:19.199 --> 01:01:20.501
One of the stage
left lights is out.

01:01:20.535 --> 01:01:21.903
It's fucking annoying.

01:01:21.936 --> 01:01:24.138
So as you enter just
stand more stage right.

01:01:24.172 --> 01:01:24.973
Okay?

01:01:25.006 --> 01:01:25.907
Oh, yeah good.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:26.774
Got it.

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:30.345
See you later.

01:01:58.608 --> 01:01:59.541
Oh, sweet Hamlet.

01:01:59.576 --> 01:02:01.310
A murderer and a villain.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:02.177
The slave is not twentieth part

01:02:02.211 --> 01:02:04.013
the tithe of the
precedent, my Lord.

01:02:04.046 --> 01:02:05.481
No more!

01:02:08.852 --> 01:02:10.253
Mrs. Cooper?

01:02:17.327 --> 01:02:18.161
Mrs. Cooper?

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:23.466
A king of shreds and patches.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.388
- I'm not saying anything.
- I know, I...

01:02:44.422 --> 01:02:46.157
- Hey, hey.
- Goodnight.

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:47.458
- Hey, um, Lillian.
- What?

01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:50.995
I just want to say,
I'm so impressed.

01:02:51.028 --> 01:02:52.430
You know that you're
getting back out there

01:02:52.463 --> 01:02:53.931
and doing this play after...

01:02:53.964 --> 01:02:54.865
Thank you.

01:02:54.899 --> 01:02:56.167
What you've been through,

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.570
and it's inspiring.

01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:58.337
All right. What
do you want? What?

01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:59.871
Do you want me
to say I'm sorry?

01:02:59.905 --> 01:03:00.906
Why would you
say you're sorry?

01:03:00.939 --> 01:03:02.474
You only sent the audience
out of the theater,

01:03:02.507 --> 01:03:03.342
all expecting a refund.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:05.977
I'm out $20,000.

01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:07.212
I've got everything in this.

01:03:07.245 --> 01:03:08.513
Why would the great
Lillian Cooper apologize

01:03:08.547 --> 01:03:09.381
for any of that?

01:03:09.414 --> 01:03:10.616
I don't know what
you've been up to.

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:12.484
What crazy rituals we've got
going on here, but you're out.

01:03:12.517 --> 01:03:14.654
Out? Hey, you know.

01:03:14.687 --> 01:03:16.922
I, I directed this
play. You can't just.

01:03:16.955 --> 01:03:18.156
It's my theater,
my production.

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.157
No, it was my idea.

01:03:19.191 --> 01:03:20.325
No, it was Shakespeare's idea.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.095
Newsflash women have
been playing Hamlet

01:03:22.128 --> 01:03:23.429
since the 1800's. Okay?

01:03:23.463 --> 01:03:25.465
The first Hamlet recorded
on film was a woman.

01:03:25.498 --> 01:03:26.667
The first radio
Hamlet was a woman.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:29.402
Your idea? No. No.

01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:32.505
You can't do that!
You can't!

01:03:33.206 --> 01:03:34.340
- Hey!
- You can't let this happen!

01:03:34.374 --> 01:03:35.375
Hey!

01:03:35.408 --> 01:03:36.442
Hey, hey!

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:40.880
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry.

01:03:43.249 --> 01:03:46.487
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.354
Ah!

01:04:04.004 --> 01:04:07.040
I don't know. Walls
are pretty bland,

01:04:07.074 --> 01:04:09.477
And you're kind of tense.

01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:11.714
Maybe you should
loosen up a little.

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.515
Well, you got anything
that can help with that?

01:04:15.517 --> 01:04:19.053
Well, the record label paid
me to take a photo of you,

01:04:19.087 --> 01:04:21.022
not get you high. So.

01:04:22.457 --> 01:04:23.425
Can't it be both?

01:04:25.393 --> 01:04:26.227
No.

01:04:30.198 --> 01:04:33.469
I'm going to use that plant
to liven up this photo.

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.937
Hey, how are you doing Taz?

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:37.440
How's it going?

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.177
Ronin, can I get
a word with you?

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.044
Hey Billy.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:09.372
All right. Call me
when the shoot's over.

01:05:14.579 --> 01:05:17.280
Oh. That looks great, right?

01:05:20.586 --> 01:05:22.621
Curtis' mom was a
big fan of your work.

01:05:26.324 --> 01:05:27.425
Has she got in touch with you?

01:05:29.494 --> 01:05:31.697
Yeah. She's pretty intense.

01:05:32.664 --> 01:05:34.398
Yeah, she's an intense woman.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.301
What did she want?

01:05:38.604 --> 01:05:42.608
Um, she just wanted some
old photos of Curtis.

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:46.111
Messy situation, isn't it?

01:05:48.514 --> 01:05:49.749
I guess so.

01:06:11.337 --> 01:06:14.207
He hired me to take
some photos of Ronin.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.611
So I went over to his
new place yesterday.

01:06:20.648 --> 01:06:22.315
And I don't know. It just,

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:24.785
it creeped me out.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.690
He even has Curtis's
brand of cigarettes.

01:06:29.723 --> 01:06:33.460
Who, I know. Like what?
Why? He doesn't even smoke.

01:06:33.494 --> 01:06:35.664
He used to give Curtis
such shit about it.

01:06:35.697 --> 01:06:39.601
And then Billy came
over, and they go outside

01:06:39.634 --> 01:06:40.769
and they're all hush hush.

01:06:40.802 --> 01:06:42.671
And I, it just...

01:06:45.205 --> 01:06:47.576
It just felt like...

01:06:48.108 --> 01:06:51.512
Ronin is in on the whole
fucking thing.

01:06:53.715 --> 01:06:57.620
It all felt so fucking weird.

01:07:15.771 --> 01:07:16.706
Hey, man.

01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:22.613
Look man, I hated
the way things ended.

01:07:23.747 --> 01:07:25.448
I mean, we can't
part ways like that.

01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:26.115
That shit that Billy said,

01:07:26.148 --> 01:07:27.550
it was totally uncalled for.

01:07:27.584 --> 01:07:30.519
And I said some stuff
too that I really wish

01:07:30.553 --> 01:07:31.554
I could take back.

01:07:32.923 --> 01:07:34.725
You know. Do what you gotta do.

01:07:34.758 --> 01:07:36.727
Start a new life. Start fresh.

01:07:38.494 --> 01:07:41.130
I really don't want there to
be any bad blood between us.

01:07:52.476 --> 01:07:53.611
Hey Mrs. Cooper.

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.748
Hey! How you doing Ronin?

01:07:57.882 --> 01:07:59.951
So we're going to
sit down for dinner.

01:07:59.984 --> 01:08:01.753
You're welcome to join us.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.520
Yeah. Place looks nice, man.

01:08:06.658 --> 01:08:07.892
Some things you
can't quit. Huh?

01:08:11.529 --> 01:08:12.731
They may not get you high,

01:08:12.765 --> 01:08:14.298
but they'll kill
you just as quick.

01:09:04.752 --> 01:09:06.386
How was the run?

01:09:06.419 --> 01:09:07.787
Oh.

01:09:07.822 --> 01:09:08.788
Run of your show.

01:09:08.823 --> 01:09:11.658
Oh. We, we closed.

01:09:11.692 --> 01:09:13.861
Had a great time though. Yeah.

01:09:13.894 --> 01:09:15.729
Hamlet. Can't go wrong.

01:09:15.763 --> 01:09:18.866
There was, um, some
new developments.

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:21.535
Maybe think might be
related to your son's death.

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:22.636
I'd like to talk
to you about it.

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:23.571
Mind if I come up?

01:09:23.604 --> 01:09:25.674
We can talk about it
here. I'm listening.

01:09:26.841 --> 01:09:28.944
The man who ran your
son's record label

01:09:28.977 --> 01:09:30.679
was murdered a few days ago.

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:31.846
Claude Felson.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.314
I heard about
that. It's a shame.

01:09:34.683 --> 01:09:37.752
You were at the theater
Tuesday, between 9:30 and 10.

01:09:37.786 --> 01:09:38.754
Well yes, I was.

01:09:39.688 --> 01:09:40.856
What about last week?

01:09:41.756 --> 01:09:42.823
Same gig.

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:44.861
You know this man?

01:09:47.662 --> 01:09:48.865
We think there's a connection

01:09:48.898 --> 01:09:50.700
between his death and Claude's.

01:09:50.733 --> 01:09:53.301
Well, does it have
something to do with my son?

01:09:54.804 --> 01:09:56.873
Both were killed with the
same make and model firearm.

01:09:56.906 --> 01:10:00.076
Ballistics is checking to see
if it's the exact same gun.

01:10:00.109 --> 01:10:01.978
And this guy is one of the
biggest importers of PMA

01:10:02.011 --> 01:10:03.746
in the city.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.782
That's the drug that killed
your son Mrs. Cooper.

01:10:05.815 --> 01:10:07.516
Yes. I know what that is.

01:10:07.549 --> 01:10:11.487
It's starting to sound like
you might think my son's death

01:10:11.521 --> 01:10:12.790
was not so accidental.

01:10:13.924 --> 01:10:15.893
I'm just asking questions.

01:10:15.926 --> 01:10:17.527
Now you're asking questions.

01:10:20.664 --> 01:10:22.465
You have a good
night, Mrs. Cooper.

01:10:22.498 --> 01:10:23.901
You as well, Detective.

01:10:23.934 --> 01:10:25.035
Stay safe.

01:10:25.068 --> 01:10:26.435
Thank you.

01:10:44.521 --> 01:10:45.489
Hello?

01:10:45.522 --> 01:10:46.490
Any update?

01:10:47.192 --> 01:10:48.026
<i>Update?</i>

01:10:50.795 --> 01:10:52.030
They followed me.

01:10:52.063 --> 01:10:52.864
And I'm scared.

01:10:53.932 --> 01:10:55.365
Who?

01:10:55.399 --> 01:10:56.001
Police.

01:10:59.872 --> 01:11:02.507
I think we just have to be
more discreet this time.

01:11:04.542 --> 01:11:05.577
Can we meet in a
couple of hours?

01:11:05.611 --> 01:11:07.079
I've got to pick
up some things.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:17.823
♪ Oh the last glimpse of sun ♪

01:11:18.523 --> 01:11:21.828
♪ Seems to not matter now ♪

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.171

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.206
If he sees you...

01:12:05.239 --> 01:12:07.642
I'm just getting something
I left in the dressing room.

01:12:07.675 --> 01:12:08.644
I'll be super quick.

01:12:26.895 --> 01:12:27.996
Hi Lillian.

01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.964
Hi Ronin.

01:12:30.531 --> 01:12:31.800
When I heard you
got a new place,

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:35.138
I had no idea how grand.

01:12:35.171 --> 01:12:36.639
Recording set up.

01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:39.541
Just like you always dreamed of.

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:41.878
Well, business is good.

01:12:45.547 --> 01:12:47.684
Sorry. I'm feeling a
little off, you know,

01:12:47.717 --> 01:12:49.619
just losing two close
friends in a few weeks.

01:12:49.652 --> 01:12:50.485
And...

01:12:52.121 --> 01:12:53.723
what happened to Claude is just.

01:12:58.095 --> 01:13:03.067
Oh, you told me you had a
song for Curtis or something?

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.068
Could I hear it?

01:13:05.769 --> 01:13:07.570
It's not finished, but you sure?

01:13:07.604 --> 01:13:08.973
Yeah. I'd love to hear it.

01:13:10.641 --> 01:13:11.976
I just want it to be perfect.

01:13:13.143 --> 01:13:13.944
I bet you do.

01:13:15.813 --> 01:13:17.147
He always liked things perfect.

01:13:19.016 --> 01:13:19.985
Even as a little boy.

01:13:22.087 --> 01:13:23.254
He was like a brother to me.

01:13:23.288 --> 01:13:24.622
He was my son.

01:13:27.225 --> 01:13:29.060
Why don't I play
that song for you?

01:13:30.295 --> 01:13:31.963
Yeah. You do that.

01:13:52.084 --> 01:13:54.020
Supposing the pistol
was not stolen,

01:13:58.657 --> 01:14:00.593
and the owner was discovered.

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:11.671
You know, it may
not be a single, but

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.076
I think it's my
favorite track so far.

01:14:16.109 --> 01:14:18.812
Oh. For your solo album.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.255
I have thought of death.

01:16:06.957 --> 01:16:07.759
Dreamt of it.

01:16:09.361 --> 01:16:10.862
Would have even prayed.

01:16:12.797 --> 01:16:15.734
If it were fit that such as
I should pray for anything.

01:16:18.737 --> 01:16:20.405
But if death be in this cup,

01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:24.142
I bid thee think again,

01:16:24.176 --> 01:16:27.078
before thou beholds
me drink it. Please?

01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:34.287
Even now, it is upon my lip.

01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:49.368
Oh, shit. Lillian.

01:16:49.402 --> 01:16:52.171
How old was Curtis when
he made these recordings?

01:16:52.205 --> 01:16:55.943
I don't know. Uh,
15, 16 years old.

01:16:55.976 --> 01:16:59.513
I found them. I just, I don't
know what to do with them.

01:16:59.546 --> 01:17:00.914
These are priceless.

01:17:01.848 --> 01:17:02.749
Really?

01:17:02.783 --> 01:17:05.018
Yes. These are demos
of some of his hits,

01:17:05.052 --> 01:17:06.253
acoustic versions.

01:17:06.286 --> 01:17:09.289
There's a lot of material here
that I'm not familiar with.

01:17:09.323 --> 01:17:11.058
Now, if it's okay with you,
I'm going to take them.

01:17:11.091 --> 01:17:12.926
I'll have them
digitize, cataloged,

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.295
and then I'll be in touch
with you about a release.

01:17:16.296 --> 01:17:18.265
You know, what's best.

01:17:18.298 --> 01:17:19.333
Toast?

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:22.470
None for me. Thanks.

01:17:22.503 --> 01:17:24.405
You know, that
stuff will kill you.

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.907
Oh.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.242
All right, you twist my arm.

01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:29.210
To Curtis.

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:31.813
To Curtis. All right.

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:39.954
That's some
seriously cold vodka.

01:17:43.324 --> 01:17:45.194
You ever seen this before Billy?

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.430
Yeah. That's beautiful.

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:52.067
He was going to
give it to Olivia.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:53.135
The night they died.

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:55.037
That's sad.

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:58.374
You don't know the
half of it, Billy.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.277
She was pregnant.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.282
Coop's grand baby.

01:18:08.518 --> 01:18:09.386
I've got to go.

01:18:33.911 --> 01:18:36.347
<i>Is there a role you
haven't played you'd liked to?</i>

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.282
<i>Portia.</i>

01:18:38.316 --> 01:18:39.884
<i>Portia?</i>

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:41.585
<i>She swallows fire.</i>

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:42.887
<i>Oh.</i>

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.257
<i>She eats hot coals
and burns from the inside.</i>

01:18:47.158 --> 01:18:48.326
<i>Wow.</i>

01:19:18.523 --> 01:19:19.892
Night.

01:19:26.466 --> 01:19:28.468
<i>Why do
we make our music?</i>

01:19:30.403 --> 01:19:33.373
<i>Oh, dark strings reply.</i>

01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:39.112
<i>Because we live
in a strange land</i>

01:19:42.248 --> 01:19:44.619
<i>and we remember a lost sky.</i>

01:19:46.688 --> 01:19:48.623
<i>We ask no leaf of the laurel.</i>

01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:52.493
<i>We know what fame is worth.</i>

01:19:55.963 --> 01:19:58.932
<i>But our songs break
out of our winter</i>

01:20:01.368 --> 01:20:04.338
<i>as the flowers, break
out on the earth.</i>

01:20:08.476 --> 01:20:11.346

it's some new ones, so.

I just fell asleep and...

01:22:15.441 --> 01:22:16.509
the road...

01:22:18.712 --> 01:22:21.548
opened up to the sky

01:22:23.583 --> 01:22:25.485
like a fog.

01:22:28.689 --> 01:22:29.723
And on it, there were...

01:22:32.627 --> 01:22:33.728
dark things.

01:22:36.564 --> 01:22:39.099
One grew into a
body without a head

01:22:40.301 --> 01:22:42.069
with a gun by its side.

01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:51.713
The other was a man
sitting, huddled,

01:22:51.746 --> 01:22:54.548
nursing a wounded leg.

01:22:56.752 --> 01:22:58.286
And then it all went black.

01:23:04.927 --> 01:23:08.163
And there was this woman thing

01:23:09.832 --> 01:23:12.802
creeping toward the
one without a head.

01:23:16.538 --> 01:23:20.476
And she reached
down and touched it.

01:23:22.511 --> 01:23:24.146
Sprang back and cried,

01:23:26.617 --> 01:23:27.651
"He's dead."

01:23:32.923 --> 01:23:34.725
Good to see you
back on stage again.

01:23:34.758 --> 01:23:37.259
Detective Eaton,
what a surprise.

01:23:37.894 --> 01:23:40.697
You were simply amazing.

01:23:42.633 --> 01:23:45.770
So, you get a lot of
time to kill backstage?

01:23:45.803 --> 01:23:47.805
Even when an actor's
waiting backstage,

01:23:47.839 --> 01:23:49.473
they're still working.

01:23:50.742 --> 01:23:52.644
Oh yeah. Yeah.

01:23:52.677 --> 01:23:55.813
I never thought of it like that.

01:23:55.847 --> 01:24:00.652
Oh, um, I finally read
that Edgar Allen Poe story

01:24:00.685 --> 01:24:02.285
that your play is based on.

01:24:03.721 --> 01:24:06.824
Killing with a candle that
emits poisonous vapor.

01:24:08.661 --> 01:24:09.695
A Deathly Light.

01:24:11.664 --> 01:24:13.331
That's one tricky
son of a bitch.

01:24:14.767 --> 01:24:17.703
I thought you said something
about coming to apologize?

01:24:17.736 --> 01:24:18.737
Yeah, I did.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:23.241
You were right about
Curtis and Olivia.

01:24:23.274 --> 01:24:25.443
their death not
being an accident.

01:24:26.444 --> 01:24:29.848
I wanted to acknowledge
that and say I'm sorry.

01:24:32.952 --> 01:24:33.753
Lillian.

01:24:37.924 --> 01:24:39.491
Just let me help you.

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:57.645
<i>He even has Curtis'
brand of cigarettes.</i>

01:24:57.678 --> 01:25:00.848
I know. Like what? Why?
He doesn't even smoke.

01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:03.616
He used to give Chris
such shit about it.

01:25:06.987 --> 01:25:08.856
You were right.

01:25:08.889 --> 01:25:10.290

01:25:10.323 --> 01:25:11.992

being an accident.

that and say, I'm sorry.

01:25:17.998 --> 01:25:19.835
Thank you.

01:25:19.868 --> 01:25:22.771
I also wanted to say that
I underestimated you.

01:25:28.744 --> 01:25:30.011
