<i>JIM:</i>
<i>Okay, turn it off, please.</i>

08:31.548 --> 08:32.327
Turn it off now.

08:34.828 --> 08:38.384
You want this to be
your first single?

08:38.451 --> 08:41.855
100% yes, but, like, I will
field any and all questions

08:41.921 --> 08:43.222
after the song's completed.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.716
There's, like,
six and a half minutes left.

08:44.783 --> 08:46.384
Can we just talk after
the song's over, please?

08:46.450 --> 08:48.653
‐Have some courtesy? Thank you.
‐No‐‐ No. Just...

08:48.720 --> 08:51.756
We are never
putting that song out. Ever.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.758
Okay? I'm actually
a little concerned

08:53.825 --> 08:55.894
that we might be
in some sort of trouble

08:55.960 --> 08:57.562
even playing it out loud here.

08:57.629 --> 09:02.000
I'm very confused as to what
you're even talking about.

09:02.066 --> 09:05.003
Like, this is the most
innovative piece of content

09:05.069 --> 09:06.871
maybe ever, in the history
of recorded media.

09:06.938 --> 09:08.339
MIKE:
Okay, so we can get
on the same page,

09:08.406 --> 09:10.709
what‐what rubbed you the most?

09:10.775 --> 09:12.510
Uh, Jim, may I?

09:12.577 --> 09:13.978
‐By all means.
‐Okay, great.

09:14.045 --> 09:17.115
Yes, let's have a nice,
civil discourse about this.

09:17.181 --> 09:20.652
As a black man, I find this
extremely offensive.

09:20.719 --> 09:22.186
‐Mm.
‐The criminal justice system,

09:22.253 --> 09:25.323
it embodies all the racism
that African Americans face

09:25.389 --> 09:26.457
in this country every day.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.427
And for you, through a black
art form no less,

09:29.493 --> 09:32.964
to take it and make such
a‐a mockery of everything,

09:33.031 --> 09:34.866
I, uh... You know, I don't
even feel comfortable

09:34.933 --> 09:37.268
working on this project now,
Jim, to be honest.

09:37.335 --> 09:39.270
I understand.

09:39.337 --> 09:40.404
Yeah, I respect that.

09:40.471 --> 09:43.141
I'm sorry that you feel
that way, I really am,

09:43.207 --> 09:45.309
but just so you know, there are
six and a half minutes left

09:45.376 --> 09:47.045
where I get to this whole climax

09:47.111 --> 09:48.580
that exposes
the criminal justice system.

09:48.647 --> 09:49.748
That's the whole point
of the song.

09:49.814 --> 09:50.882
You just didn't
let me get there.

09:50.949 --> 09:52.751
I lure people in with absurdity
through, like,

09:52.817 --> 09:54.418
the lens of a privileged
perspective.

09:54.485 --> 09:57.556
‐And so, can I please just...
Thank you.
‐Go ahead.

09:57.622 --> 09:59.691
♪♪ Bit off his dick ♪♪

09:59.758 --> 10:01.593
♪♪ Ay, carambo ♪♪

10:01.660 --> 10:02.861
♪♪ Spit out his dick ♪♪

10:02.927 --> 10:04.996
♪♪ Ugh! He fell to his knees... ♪♪

10:05.063 --> 10:06.998
‐No. Uh... Unbelievable.
‐(others groaning)

10:07.065 --> 10:09.968
‐PAM: May I also chime in?
‐JIM: Please, Pam.

10:10.034 --> 10:14.172
For you to be making jokes
about rape... ever,

10:14.238 --> 10:16.174
let alone in 2020,

10:16.240 --> 10:18.977
(scoffs) I'm just shocked at
the level of tone‐deafness here.

10:19.043 --> 10:21.713
Okay, Pam, j‐just so we're
on the same page,

10:21.780 --> 10:23.882
are you saying that
man‐to‐man prison rape

10:23.948 --> 10:25.650
is, like, the same vibe

10:25.717 --> 10:26.785
‐as, like, regular rape?
‐Vibe?!

10:26.851 --> 10:30.254
‐No... (stammers)
‐Vibe?

10:30.321 --> 10:32.991
I... Uh, we're saying‐‐
we're saying the same thing.

10:33.057 --> 10:35.093
Okay, this is a lot to digest,

10:35.159 --> 10:37.095
so let us have some time with
this and we'll come back to you.

10:37.161 --> 10:38.162
‐Is that cool?
‐No, there's no time.

10:38.229 --> 10:39.363
Like, I don't need
to digest anything.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.600
I didn't come here for feedback,
or even approval.

10:41.666 --> 10:43.735
I came here to tell you this is
exactly what it's going to be.

10:43.802 --> 10:45.503
This is my first single.
This is my art.

10:45.570 --> 10:47.672
You know, when I signed to
you guys, it was very clear:

10:47.739 --> 10:49.641
creative is my thing,
you guys figure out the rest.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.243
It is what it is, like, that's
the deal we agreed upon.

10:52.310 --> 10:55.279
Okay, Dave, you are signed
to us now. Okay?

10:55.346 --> 10:58.316
We do control what you release,
when you release it

10:58.382 --> 10:59.551
and all that.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.986
But it's clear to us now,
you need our guidance.

11:02.053 --> 11:03.755
You know what,
don't do me any favors, okay?

11:03.822 --> 11:05.489
Because, by the way, this...

11:05.557 --> 11:08.827
this is the real fucking jail.

11:09.861 --> 11:11.596
‐Dave...
‐No, I'm not‐‐ This is crazy.

11:11.663 --> 11:13.497
(door opens, slams)

11:15.433 --> 11:18.502
We will, uh...

11:18.570 --> 11:20.672
we'll get back to you.

11:20.739 --> 11:21.840
What the fuck were you
doing in there?

11:21.906 --> 11:23.174
What the fuck
was I doing in there?

11:23.241 --> 11:24.943
Yeah, well, how the‐how the fuck
is Spotify gonna play that

11:25.009 --> 11:26.911
on New Music Friday?
Are you out of your mind?

11:26.978 --> 11:28.446
And by the way, your days
of not letting me

11:28.512 --> 11:30.381
hear the music in advance
are officially over, pal.

11:30.448 --> 11:31.950
I can't believe you let me
go in there blind like that.

11:32.016 --> 11:32.951
They're never gonna let that go.

11:33.017 --> 11:34.504
Who cares what they want?!

11:34.571 --> 11:36.406
What are you talking about?
I'm your client.

11:36.473 --> 11:38.141
You should only be worried
about me!

11:38.208 --> 11:39.509
I am only worried about you,

11:39.576 --> 11:41.144
whether or not your pea‐sized
brain realizes it or not.

11:41.211 --> 11:42.479
You got to get me out
of this deal.

11:42.545 --> 11:43.781
I'm not doing this
for my whole career.

11:43.847 --> 11:45.082
Get me out of the fucking deal.

11:45.148 --> 11:46.449
‐Really? Really, dude?
‐Yeah, get me out of the deal.

11:46.516 --> 11:47.717
‐Yeah.
‐Okay, so you're not
willing to compromise

11:47.785 --> 11:49.787
for $250,000 and a‐a machine

11:49.853 --> 11:51.521
that's gonna help you live out
your dreams?

11:51.588 --> 11:53.523
My dreams? You think my dreams
are running everything

11:53.590 --> 11:55.826
up the flagpole whenever I want
to put a song out? No.

11:55.893 --> 11:58.896
I can't half go for it.
I can't compromise my art.

11:58.962 --> 12:01.331
Your job is to do what I want.

12:01.398 --> 12:03.733
You listen to what I want,
and you make it happen

12:03.801 --> 12:05.202
at all costs.

12:05.268 --> 12:07.470
You don't worry about appeasing
other random people.

12:07.537 --> 12:08.772
I'm not worried about appeasing
random people...

12:08.839 --> 12:10.307
Do your fucking job!

12:10.373 --> 12:12.709
Do it! Do your job!

12:20.571 --> 12:23.023
I don't understand, like, this
is the best thing I've ever done

12:23.090 --> 12:24.943
by far; I've put
so much time into it.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.120
And Mike just sits there
nodding his head "yes,"

12:27.187 --> 12:29.171
doing whatever they want,
not even defending my vision,

12:29.238 --> 12:30.956
‐like a fucking pussy.
‐Hmm.

12:31.022 --> 12:33.700
Okay, would you ever compromise
your art for anybody?

12:33.767 --> 12:35.702
If they were paying me? Yeah.

12:35.769 --> 12:40.006
‐Can we get into your logos?
‐Okay.

12:40.073 --> 12:41.975
Okay, so per your e‐mail,

12:42.042 --> 12:44.010
I got a bunch of shafts,
a bunch of balls.

12:44.077 --> 12:45.879
You know, some young, some old.

12:45.946 --> 12:47.581
You can, like,
mix and match them.

12:47.648 --> 12:50.484
‐Hmm, wrinkles.
‐Yeah.

12:50.551 --> 12:51.718
I knew you would want wrinkles.

12:51.785 --> 12:53.487
I got, like, 12 wrinkled dicks
for you.

12:53.554 --> 12:58.224
And then, for myself,
I did some without dicks.

12:59.425 --> 13:02.929
I actually‐‐ I like this
non‐dick one. Let's do that.

13:02.996 --> 13:06.299
So you want, like, 50 different
variations of this

13:06.366 --> 13:08.969
‐that will then ultimately
have a dick in it?
‐No.

13:09.035 --> 13:10.671
I think that
that will work fine.

13:10.737 --> 13:12.105
Let's just do that.

13:13.674 --> 13:14.908
Okay.

13:14.975 --> 13:16.643
Sweet. Done.

13:16.710 --> 13:19.813
‐Yeah. How's Al?
‐(clicks tongue)

13:19.880 --> 13:22.182
‐She's good. (scoffs)
‐Whoa.

13:22.248 --> 13:23.784
You don't have to rush out,
I'm just asking a question.

13:23.850 --> 13:24.818
I'm not rushing out.

13:24.885 --> 13:26.252
What do you mean "she's good"?

13:26.319 --> 13:28.321
Is she going on dates?
That's all I want to know.

13:28.388 --> 13:30.290
Dave, I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

13:30.356 --> 13:31.424
I'm not asking you to get
in the middle.

13:31.492 --> 13:33.259
I asked you one simple question.
And honestly,

13:33.326 --> 13:35.261
your lack of a response
is very telling,

13:35.328 --> 13:36.663
so you've already told me
she is.

13:36.730 --> 13:39.700
I'm not talking to either one
of you about either one of you.

13:39.766 --> 13:40.934
You guys aren't speaking
for a reason,

13:41.001 --> 13:42.402
so I'm not gonna be
the messenger.

13:42.468 --> 13:44.470
Okay, I got to go.
Love you. Bye.

13:46.406 --> 13:49.943
(door opens, closes)

BENNY:
Dude...

14:00.854 --> 14:04.457
‐This is, like, the best thing
I've ever fucking heard.
‐I know, right?!

14:04.525 --> 14:07.193
At first, I thought it was too
problematic, but by the end,

14:07.260 --> 14:10.597
how you tied everything in with
the criminal justice system,

14:10.664 --> 14:14.735
it's just, like, such a chef's
kiss on social commentary.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.837
Thank you!
Yes, you understand it.

14:16.903 --> 14:19.305
It's, like, yes.

14:19.372 --> 14:20.541
And the label won't even
put it out.

14:20.607 --> 14:22.943
They think it's too offensive.

14:23.009 --> 14:26.146
‐You should just
fucking leak it.
‐Leak it?

14:26.212 --> 14:27.681
‐Just put it out?
‐What if you premiere it

14:27.748 --> 14:28.882
on <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

14:28.949 --> 14:30.250
Like, imagine sitting down

14:30.316 --> 14:32.753
and talking with Charlemagne
about jail.

14:32.819 --> 14:35.789
Yeah, I mean, I wish I could,
but... it's, like, not easy.

14:35.856 --> 14:37.257
Dude, yeah, not easy.

14:37.323 --> 14:38.992
Um, I could text him right now.

14:39.059 --> 14:40.927
Yeah, text him.

14:40.994 --> 14:43.930
‐Okay. I'm doing it.
‐But, like,

14:43.997 --> 14:45.131
couldn't I get in trouble
with the label?

14:45.198 --> 14:46.633
Like, couldn't they just sue me?

14:46.700 --> 14:49.069
All right, one of two things
are gonna happen.

14:49.135 --> 14:52.205
You're gonna play the song,
everyone loves it,

14:52.272 --> 14:54.107
your label's gonna be excited,

14:54.174 --> 14:55.509
let you do whatever you want.

14:55.576 --> 14:57.310
Full creative control.

14:57.377 --> 15:00.747
Or... everyone's gonna think
it's terrible,

15:00.814 --> 15:02.483
the label's gonna drop you.

15:02.549 --> 15:04.284
But it's what you wanted
this whole time,

15:04.350 --> 15:06.452
and you're out of your contract
and free to do

15:06.520 --> 15:07.721
whatever you want.

15:07.788 --> 15:09.490
It's a win‐win to me.

15:11.257 --> 15:12.392
Brilliant.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.894
Ah, yeah.

15:17.911 --> 15:20.661
Yes, The Breakfast Club.
Benny got me on.

15:20.728 --> 15:22.042
‐I‐I see it.
‐Totally real.

15:22.109 --> 15:23.471
‐Okay. That's awesome.
‐Yeah.

15:23.538 --> 15:25.884
Okay, CC me on the e‐mail, then
I'll reach out to the label.

15:25.951 --> 15:28.453
‐I'll let 'em know that
you're gonna be...
‐No. Don't say a word.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.223
Like, do not.

15:31.289 --> 15:32.658
Why the fuck not?

15:32.725 --> 15:36.228
Because I'm gonna premiere
"Jail" on <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

15:36.294 --> 15:37.630
I'm just gonna‐‐
just put it out there.

15:37.696 --> 15:39.765
It's the best thing
I've ever done, Mike.

15:39.832 --> 15:41.266
Like, I have to put it out.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.035
You‐you can't just go
behind the label's back.

15:43.101 --> 15:45.370
Okay, we signed a contract
with them.

15:45.437 --> 15:46.805
Okay, I need to start doing
what I want.

15:46.872 --> 15:49.007
Not doing what I want
has gotten me in this position.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.342
I didn't want to sign
with this label.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.344
You really influenced me
on that.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.879
It's not a side project
for everybody, man.

15:53.946 --> 15:54.947
Like, this is my life.

15:55.013 --> 15:57.249
I quit my job.

15:58.817 --> 16:01.119
‐Really?
‐Yeah, really.

16:01.186 --> 16:03.922
‐When?
‐When the advance came in,

16:03.989 --> 16:05.357
I‐I put in my two weeks.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.059
I was waiting until this became
a real thing,

16:07.125 --> 16:08.393
and it did, so I quit.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.362
Why didn't you tell me
when it happened?

16:10.428 --> 16:13.098
Because after that fucking
"Jail" meeting,

16:13.165 --> 16:15.067
I‐I was trying to get it back.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.002
Oh, that sounds about right.

16:17.069 --> 16:19.337
Can you blame me?

16:19.404 --> 16:22.174
Well, don't try to, like,
guilt me into

16:22.240 --> 16:23.676
making decisions for you now.

16:23.742 --> 16:25.010
‐That's not, I mean...
‐That's fine.

16:25.077 --> 16:26.679
I'm just going on the record
right now and telling you

16:26.745 --> 16:29.748
I think it's a very bad idea,
and you're going to piss off

16:29.815 --> 16:32.517
some very important people.
So just‐just know that.

16:32.585 --> 16:34.452
Well, I want to go on record
saying that it's a risk

16:34.519 --> 16:36.154
that I'm willing to take.

16:36.221 --> 16:39.457
I can't, like, half‐ass it.

16:39.524 --> 16:41.059
I have to go with what
I believe in.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.394
Okay.

16:50.703 --> 16:52.938
What are chives?

16:53.005 --> 16:55.140
It's like onion bits.

16:55.207 --> 16:56.975
We've done this, like,
a thousand times.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.777
Wow.

17:08.086 --> 17:10.055
‐Oh, baby.
‐Look at this, huh?

17:10.122 --> 17:13.258
A Lil Dicky studio session,
not using another artist's time.

17:13.325 --> 17:16.028
You're getting paid
by my stupid fucking label.

17:16.094 --> 17:17.429
Everyone wins.

17:17.495 --> 17:20.465
‐What's wrong with them?
‐Everything.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.502
I need to really lock in
on this album right now.

17:24.569 --> 17:28.573
It's the only thing that is
keeping me alive.

17:28.641 --> 17:30.542
I have to tell you something.

17:31.576 --> 17:33.612
I'm leaving town for a second.

17:33.679 --> 17:37.115
I'm going on tour
with Trippie Redd.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.350
He asked me to go
on tour with him,

17:38.416 --> 17:40.052
and engineer on the road and...

17:40.118 --> 17:41.253
For how long?

17:41.319 --> 17:43.221
Um, six weeks.

17:43.288 --> 17:46.224
Six weeks? What the fuck, dude?
I'm... (scoffs)

17:46.291 --> 17:47.760
Bro, six weeks isn't even
that long.

17:47.826 --> 17:51.496
That's fine. I'll... (groans)
I'll do everything myself.

17:51.563 --> 17:54.166
Aren't you happy for me,
at least a little bit?

17:54.232 --> 17:55.868
Zero percent happy for you.

17:58.704 --> 18:02.775
I'm happy for you, obviously,
I'm just sad. Just...

18:02.841 --> 18:06.378
You have me here now.
Let's get to work.

you ready to risk it all

just to get some jokes off?

20:05.063 --> 20:06.632

20:07.499 --> 20:08.767
I'm getting, like, very sick

20:08.834 --> 20:11.336
of people telling me
how to live my life.

Club, you'd think they'd have

‐GATA: Good morning.
How you doin'?
‐Angela.

20:33.267 --> 20:34.368
‐Yes?
‐I'm a hugger. Sorry.

20:34.435 --> 20:35.536
‐Um, okay.
‐Mm.

20:35.603 --> 20:36.838
‐All right.
‐Good to meet you.

20:36.905 --> 20:38.072
‐Charlamagne.
‐Nice to meet you.

20:38.139 --> 20:39.507
‐MIKE: Hi. Mike.
‐Would you like a hug?

20:39.573 --> 20:40.675
No, I'm not a hugger.
How are you?

20:40.742 --> 20:42.076
‐Good. How you doing?
‐I mean, I'm a hugger,

20:42.143 --> 20:43.611
‐but I just don't
know you, so...
‐Sure.

20:43.678 --> 20:45.146
‐Yeah. Yeah.
‐I'm Dave, nice to meet you.

20:45.213 --> 20:47.982
DAVE:
Man, I can't wait
for you guys to hear

20:48.049 --> 20:49.583
this song that I've got.

20:49.650 --> 20:52.120
‐Hey, Jim.
‐Hey, Mike.

20:52.186 --> 20:53.888
Did you really think we weren't
gonna find out about this?

20:53.955 --> 20:55.189
You know,
you're supposed to keep us

20:55.256 --> 20:56.224
in the loop about this stuff.

20:56.290 --> 20:57.826
I mean, we're partners.

20:57.892 --> 21:00.428
‐Okay.
‐You're right.
Uh, you know, let's...

21:00.494 --> 21:02.030
Oh, my gosh,
are we in third grade?

21:02.096 --> 21:04.498
‐(speaking indistinctly)
‐DAVE: Is this microphone mine?

21:04.565 --> 21:07.001
‐Whose else would it be?
‐Touché.

21:07.068 --> 21:09.537
I think we should trust
Dave's artistic process.

21:09.603 --> 21:10.839
‐I do.
‐Okay, no, so‐so check this out.

21:10.905 --> 21:12.040
And I want to watch
what's happening.

21:12.106 --> 21:13.507
I know, and let's watch
from right here.

21:13.574 --> 21:16.410
‐You're a little new,
aren't you?
‐I'm brand‐new to this.

21:16.477 --> 21:18.980
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Wake that ass up.</i>
<i>Early in the morning.</i>

21:19.047 --> 21:21.082
The Breakfast Club.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.051
Morning, everybody, I'm Angela
Yee, that's Charlamagne Tha God.

21:23.117 --> 21:25.754
‐Yep.
‐We are The Breakfast Club,
and we have

21:25.820 --> 21:27.789
a very special guest
in the building.

21:27.856 --> 21:29.791
‐Lil Dicky is here.
‐Hello, everybody.

21:29.858 --> 21:31.392
CHARLAMAGNE:
Yeah, he keeps
introducing himself

21:31.459 --> 21:33.027
‐a‐as Dave, though.
‐Yeah.

21:33.094 --> 21:35.296
That's, uh, that's my name.
So, I just feel weird, like,

21:35.363 --> 21:37.866
introducing myself
as anything other than my name.

21:37.932 --> 21:39.400
That's pretty un‐rapper‐like
of you.

21:39.467 --> 21:40.969
‐I know, right?
‐(chuckles)

21:41.035 --> 21:42.937
Is that something you take pride
in, uh, "being different"?

21:43.004 --> 21:46.941
You know, not‐not being, like,
uh, seen as a typical rapper?

21:47.008 --> 21:48.276
Not necessarily.

21:48.342 --> 21:50.011
I‐I don't want to even speak
to what other rappers do.

21:50.078 --> 21:52.180
I just, like, if I'm gonna meet
someone, I'm not gonna be like,

21:52.246 --> 21:54.883
"Hi, I'm Lil Dicky," 'cause,
like, I'm not. Like, I'm Dave.

21:54.949 --> 21:56.851
Like, the guy behind Lil Dicky.
You know what I mean?

21:56.918 --> 21:58.486
‐Mm.
‐ANGELA: So the whole
Lil Dicky thing

21:58.552 --> 21:59.688
is just a parody?

21:59.754 --> 22:01.990
No, I don't think it's a parody.

22:02.056 --> 22:04.625
I mean, there's jokes in it
because I'm, like,

22:04.693 --> 22:06.094
a comical human being,
I suppose,

22:06.160 --> 22:07.962
but it's more satire
than anything.

22:08.029 --> 22:09.363
Do you worry that people
will look at you

22:09.430 --> 22:10.765
as a culture vulture
because of that?

22:10.832 --> 22:14.936
I mean, I worry about just about
everything, Charlamagne.

22:15.003 --> 22:16.805
Like, I wake up
and I start worrying.

22:16.871 --> 22:19.007
W‐Who's your guy over there with
the dreads? That's your shooter?

22:19.073 --> 22:21.075
That's your weed man? That's
your‐‐ Go on. W‐What does he do?

22:21.142 --> 22:23.111
You're being a little
stereotypical, Charlamagne.

22:23.177 --> 22:24.278
That's my friend Gata.

22:24.345 --> 22:26.380
So you just walk around
with a token black guy

22:26.447 --> 22:28.817
to make yourself look cool?

22:28.883 --> 22:29.951
No.

22:30.018 --> 22:31.652
Gata, come over here,
my brother.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.221
‐I want to holler at you, man.
‐Ah, for real?

22:33.287 --> 22:35.156
‐Yes, man. Come here.
‐Ah, shit.
‐All right. Here's your mic.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.158
‐I can't believe this.
‐DAVE: Wow.

22:37.225 --> 22:38.760
CHARLAMAGNE:
I want to ask you
some questions about, uh,

22:38.827 --> 22:40.228
Lil Dicky, Dave here.

22:40.294 --> 22:41.462
Uh, do you work for Lil Dicky?

22:41.529 --> 22:43.064
Yeah, that's my partner
in crime. I'm his hype man.

22:43.131 --> 22:44.966
We be turning up,
geeked up on stage.

22:45.033 --> 22:46.901
Do you actually fuck
with Lil Dicky's music?

22:46.968 --> 22:48.636
Dope, bro. One of the greatest.

22:48.703 --> 22:50.338
‐Greatest what?
‐Rappers.

22:50.404 --> 22:52.340
I tell him that every fucking
day. Like, "Bro, you dope

22:52.406 --> 22:54.208
"as fuck, bro, keep doing
your shit. Be yourself, bro.

22:54.275 --> 22:55.910
‐Don't fold on these niggas."
‐No.

22:55.977 --> 22:57.545
You're not gonna convince me
that Lil Dicky is one

22:57.611 --> 22:58.947
of the‐the best rappers
out right now, brah.

22:59.013 --> 23:01.249
‐Hey, man, you're gonna see,
Charlamagne.
‐Stop it.

23:01.315 --> 23:04.118
One day, bro. Might not be
today, but you gonna see.

23:04.185 --> 23:06.888
A‐And what made you pick
a black man as your hype man?

23:08.356 --> 23:10.959
‐Well, uh...
‐It's not a complicated
question, sir.

23:11.025 --> 23:13.828
I didn't think racially when I‐‐
I mean, I picked Gata.

23:13.895 --> 23:15.697
He's been a hype man
for other rappers.

23:15.764 --> 23:17.799
Gata knows all my songs
and he's, like, honestly,

23:17.866 --> 23:19.033
a very, like,
talented performer.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.634
‐He's great at dancing. He's...
‐Wow.

23:20.702 --> 23:22.036
Of course a white man
would think

23:22.103 --> 23:23.972
a black man
is a great dancer, Dave.

23:24.038 --> 23:28.910
I mean, he's just,
you know, uh...

23:28.977 --> 23:30.845
I mean, yeah, he's, like,

23:30.912 --> 23:34.082
he's really‐‐ he's good at‐‐
yeah, uh...

23:34.148 --> 23:35.616
‐not...
‐ANGELA: Good at what?

23:35.684 --> 23:38.252
Wait, is that cultural
appropriation?

23:38.319 --> 23:40.188
CHARLAMAGNE:
Yeah.

23:40.254 --> 23:41.322
It is.

23:41.389 --> 23:42.857
Uh...

23:42.924 --> 23:46.695
Is it? I'm wondering now
if it is or not.

23:46.761 --> 23:49.497
Just right now? Just right now
at this moment, a white rapper

23:49.563 --> 23:52.767
is wondering if what he's doing
is cultural appropriation?

23:52.834 --> 23:54.102
GATA:
Man, fuck all that.

23:54.168 --> 23:56.104
I been in this nigga's
mama house.

23:56.170 --> 23:59.107
They done cooked for me,
I done slept in the guest room.

23:59.173 --> 24:01.542
Seriously, y'all don't know.
Don't even fall for the hoopla.

24:01.609 --> 24:03.477
You've been there for me,
like, when I was down, bro,

24:03.544 --> 24:05.046
on my mama, nigga, like...

24:05.113 --> 24:06.580
We supposed to be together,
getting this money...

24:06.647 --> 24:07.882
‐ANGELA: Wow.
‐...doing shit

24:07.949 --> 24:09.450
that people ain't
never seen before, bro.

24:09.517 --> 24:12.320
‐And that's what you doing,
my nigga.
‐Here's what I'll say.

24:12.386 --> 24:15.056
If having Gata be
a part of my rap career

24:15.123 --> 24:16.524
is, in fact,
cultural appropriation

24:16.590 --> 24:19.093
in a way that was totally over
my head, which is obviously

24:19.160 --> 24:22.063
so possible because I'm that
stupid as a human being,

24:22.130 --> 24:25.767
then I really don't
have regrets.

24:25.834 --> 24:28.236
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I know that's a bizarre thing
to say, but he's, like‐‐

24:28.302 --> 24:30.204
I got, like, one of the best
friends I'll ever have

24:30.271 --> 24:32.406
out of it, so, like, I would
do it again. I love this man.

24:32.473 --> 24:34.075
‐CHARLAMAGNE: That's beautiful.
‐ANGELA: #RelationshipGoals.

24:34.142 --> 24:35.443
‐I love you, too, my nigga.
‐CHARLAMAGNE: That's it.

24:35.509 --> 24:36.911
Real talk, bro.
You my brother for life, bro.

24:36.978 --> 24:38.279
‐I love you.
‐(Angela laughs)

24:38.346 --> 24:41.315
Y'all just need to be a couple.
Where'd y'all meet, Tinder?

24:41.382 --> 24:43.384
‐(laughs)
‐All right, Gata,
cat's out of the bag.

24:43.451 --> 24:45.086
‐Give me a smooch.
‐GATA: Look at this guy.

24:45.153 --> 24:47.055
Always being funny, man.
I can't believe you, brah.

24:47.121 --> 24:48.990
‐I think he's serious.
‐(gasps)
‐CHARLAMAGNE: Aw.

24:49.057 --> 24:52.426
‐ANGELA: You guys are cute.
‐GATA: I'm out of here.
South Central L. A.,

24:52.493 --> 24:54.295
we did it, Gata made it
to <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

24:54.362 --> 24:57.065
Shout‐out, Angela Yee,
LD, Charlamagne, I'm gone.

24:57.131 --> 24:59.033
‐That's right. Good to meet you.
‐I'm out.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.703
I have waited so long
for that kiss, you have no idea.

25:01.770 --> 25:03.537
‐(laughs)
‐So, Dave, you told our producer

25:03.604 --> 25:05.373
that you have a song
that you want to premiere

25:05.439 --> 25:06.775
right here
on <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

25:06.841 --> 25:08.777
‐Huh, Lil Dave? Lil Dicky?
‐Yes.

25:08.843 --> 25:11.612
So, yeah, I've got this,
it's my life's work.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.082
It's the best thing I've ever...

25:14.148 --> 25:15.817
um...

25:16.650 --> 25:18.853
I'm just gonna...

25:21.589 --> 25:23.257
Huh?

25:23.324 --> 25:24.859
Well, if I'm being honest with
you, I have had conversations

25:24.926 --> 25:26.160
recently with my team
about whether or not

25:26.227 --> 25:27.595
it's ready
for public consumption.

25:27.662 --> 25:29.563
And it's actually not finished
yet now that I think about it.

25:29.630 --> 25:31.499
How about I just rap
for you instead?

25:31.565 --> 25:33.968
‐You knew you was coming
to The Breakfast Club.
‐So let me rap.

25:34.035 --> 25:35.436
Y‐You really ready to rap live

25:35.503 --> 25:39.507
in front of eight million
listeners tuned in?

25:39.573 --> 25:41.976
I think it is eight million
potential new fans,

25:42.043 --> 25:43.311
and sometimes you have no choice

25:43.377 --> 25:45.179
and it just is what it is,
so here we go.

25:45.246 --> 25:46.414
Eight million people
that's about to think

25:46.480 --> 25:47.448
that you're wack.

25:47.515 --> 25:48.616
