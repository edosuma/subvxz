WEBVTT

00:02.580 --> 00:05.328
<i>All units report, we
are in pursuit of the Jackal.</i>

00:06.603 --> 00:09.306
Hold on, let me get
to a better spot, Harry.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.322
How about now?
Can you hear me now?

00:11.447 --> 00:14.228
Good. 'Cause what I was
saying was I'm coming, Harry.

00:14.369 --> 00:16.447
I just got a little
caught up in something.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.931
What could be more important
than my dad's unveiling

00:19.056 --> 00:21.008
of the Osborn Academy
for Geniuses?

00:21.087 --> 00:23.909
Nothing. It's just cops
have all of downtown

00:23.982 --> 00:25.758
<i>blocked off in pursuit
of this Jackal guy.</i>

00:25.861 --> 00:29.103
A jackal? Shouldn't they be
calling animal control instead?

00:30.470 --> 00:32.165
Very funny.
He's a super villain

00:32.274 --> 00:33.945
who stole some...

00:37.259 --> 00:38.328
Stark tech.

00:40.064 --> 00:41.587
Hold on a second.

00:44.134 --> 00:46.923
Still there? Sounded
like the call got dropped.

00:48.305 --> 00:49.461
It did,

00:49.563 --> 00:51.830
for a sec. <i>Just get
your butt over here.</i>

00:52.071 --> 00:55.923
I am. I'm just waiting for
the traffic light to change.

00:57.634 --> 00:59.220
And there's the green
I was looking for.

00:59.321 --> 01:00.673
I'll be there soon, Harry.

01:00.721 --> 01:03.622
I have a hunch this is all
gonna clear up real soon.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.266
I hope.

01:05.902 --> 01:08.068
Everybody look out!

01:11.864 --> 01:13.066
Uh, listen, Harry.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.216
I should really go.
But don't worry.

01:15.295 --> 01:16.794
I should be there soon.

01:21.419 --> 01:23.754
And now, to snag the Jackal

01:23.802 --> 01:25.396
with a well-placed web.

01:25.974 --> 01:30.498
Guys, we really need to coordinate
things if we're going to share the sky.

01:32.271 --> 01:34.685
We just got ahead of him.
We're cutting him off now.

01:37.451 --> 01:39.959
Why bother fighting
for the sky,

01:40.263 --> 01:43.552
when the whole city will soon
belong to the Jackal?

01:46.185 --> 01:49.841
No no!
No no no no no no no!

02:01.603 --> 02:03.141
Gotta web something quick.

02:04.907 --> 02:07.126
Yow! That's too much fan
for my fanny.

02:07.196 --> 02:08.226
Uh-oh.

02:08.274 --> 02:09.687
The tail rotor's out.

02:09.844 --> 02:11.024
I'm going down!

02:11.329 --> 02:13.313
I did that. Sorry.

02:15.879 --> 02:19.218
Nice work, Spider-Man.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.531
How is it that most kids
are dealing with homework,

02:21.609 --> 02:23.844
and I'm dealing with five tons
of crashing metal?

02:24.344 --> 02:26.343
The Greeks knew that
all the strength in the world

02:26.391 --> 02:27.797
would still need
a fulcrum.

02:27.953 --> 02:30.387
That's why they invented
the pulley.

02:32.270 --> 02:33.700
No!

02:36.200 --> 02:38.137
Oops-ilon.

02:38.278 --> 02:40.669
Forgot to compensate
for weight distribution.

02:40.841 --> 02:43.387
Now I've got to save the pilots
and the people on the street.

02:43.450 --> 02:44.637
Ugh!

02:44.747 --> 02:46.536
Oh!

02:47.317 --> 02:48.794
I think I'm gonna make it!

02:48.919 --> 02:50.021
What?

02:50.069 --> 02:53.114
Whoa. Did the Jackal
just do my job for me?

02:56.716 --> 02:58.981
Thanks, Spider-Man.
It's not very "bad guy" of him.

02:59.029 --> 03:00.644
We got the Jackal cornered.

03:00.692 --> 03:01.825
All units respond.

03:04.908 --> 03:07.044
Hold your fire.
He's taken a captive.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.036
Not on my watch, he isn't.

03:13.866 --> 03:15.199
Ah! Ahh!

03:15.629 --> 03:17.668
Ah. Hey, there.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.661
There you are,
safe as can be.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.777
Thanks. I don't mean
to judge,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.081
but you know you could've
just created a web fan

03:25.129 --> 03:28.278
and made a wind cushion from the
helicopter's air pressure, right?

03:28.949 --> 03:30.159
Uh... O...

03:30.249 --> 03:33.942
Yeah. I mean, I guess that's
one way I could've done that.

03:34.372 --> 03:36.958
But you still prefer
your way, huh?

03:37.520 --> 03:41.278
Not to judge, but you know you could
have just ended with "thanks," right?

03:41.348 --> 03:43.833
I guess that's one way
I could've done that.

03:44.028 --> 03:47.747
But do the people you put in harm's way
usually greet you with a warm reception?

03:48.059 --> 03:50.262
The Osborn Academy reception!

03:52.270 --> 03:54.012
Drat. I missed it.

03:54.661 --> 03:56.239
Sure did.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.270
I'm so sorry, Harry.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.395
I-I...

03:59.497 --> 04:00.997
I know, I know.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.809
You're Peter Parker.

04:03.004 --> 04:04.942
Let's just forget it
and I'll show you around.

04:05.090 --> 04:07.145
Everybody who is anybody
was here.

04:07.387 --> 04:09.168
Including Max and
the Horizon High gang.

04:09.489 --> 04:11.309
Maybe we can catch up
with them on the tour.

04:11.536 --> 04:12.590
I gotta say,

04:12.661 --> 04:14.286
I'd never actually
admit it to him,

04:14.348 --> 04:16.714
but my dad opening
this school for geniuses

04:16.801 --> 04:18.041
is pretty cool.

04:18.089 --> 04:19.245
Awesome view.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.262
Yeah. Norman converted
the penthouse

04:21.333 --> 04:24.551
of the Oscorp building so that the
Osborn Academy is at the very top.

04:24.879 --> 04:26.799
Gives students something
to reach for.

04:26.906 --> 04:29.098
Whoa. That's a long way
to reach.

04:29.325 --> 04:32.285
And that's why our students
will be the very best.

04:32.442 --> 04:33.877
Starting with Harry here,

04:34.075 --> 04:36.621
who's just been appointed
class president, by the way.

04:36.770 --> 04:37.881
Hmm?

04:40.075 --> 04:43.020
Mr. Osborn.
Good to see you again, sir.

04:43.145 --> 04:44.575
You as well, Peter.

04:44.645 --> 04:46.864
Are you here to apply
for enrollment?

04:47.575 --> 04:49.864
Oh. Thanks, Mr. Osborn.

04:50.012 --> 04:52.450
But I just got accepted
into Horizon High.

04:52.575 --> 04:56.388
Hm. Well, let's hope you don't get
suspended for something you didn't do.

04:56.577 --> 04:57.743
Dad.

05:02.190 --> 05:03.489
Don't worry, sir.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.896
I have no doubt that'll
get cleared up very soon.

05:06.123 --> 05:08.661
But it was nice of you
to do all this for Harry.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.162
When it involves my son,

05:10.279 --> 05:12.474
I will move mountains
if need be.

05:12.724 --> 05:15.068
Wouldn't that upset
the organic balance of nature?

05:15.373 --> 05:19.122
Science is the enhancement of nature, Max.
You know that.

05:19.365 --> 05:22.717
It's good to see you again.
We wouldn't have missed it.

05:22.849 --> 05:26.037
Any opportunity to expand
the minds of young students

05:26.099 --> 05:27.498
is always a reason
to celebrate.

05:27.584 --> 05:29.404
I'm glad you see it
that way.

05:29.506 --> 05:32.115
I thought you
might feel threatened.

05:32.248 --> 05:35.262
Not at all. Schools
should be able to coexist

05:35.310 --> 05:36.771
within a supportive environment.

05:36.997 --> 05:39.708
Not to mention my school
is filled to capacity.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.887
Well, I assure you,
by the end of the day,

05:41.935 --> 05:43.847
our school will be
full as well.

05:43.943 --> 05:47.115
In fact, let's look in on some
of the auditions, shall we?

05:47.748 --> 05:51.053
Glad to see it's not just
Horizon events you're late for.

05:51.209 --> 05:52.576
There was a lot of traffic.

05:52.654 --> 05:54.075
Well, you know what they say.

05:54.123 --> 05:55.169
The shortest distance

05:55.217 --> 05:56.287
between two points

05:56.342 --> 05:58.092
is the express train.

05:58.642 --> 06:01.786
Hey, Pete, you still haven't
met Gwen Stacy, have you?

06:01.834 --> 06:03.800
Gwen Stacy?
I have.

06:03.935 --> 06:06.802
I mean, I haven't.
I mean... I'm Peter.

06:06.895 --> 06:08.122
I know who you are.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.240
You do?

06:09.365 --> 06:10.942
Yeah. Parker, right?

06:11.010 --> 06:13.997
You saved everyone from the Vibranium fire.
Nicely done.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.833
- Thanks.
- Don't let it go to your head.

06:16.997 --> 06:19.559
You still ruined
my entire project.

06:19.661 --> 06:21.341
Over here, everyone.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.466
I prefer to use
two-way mirrors,

06:23.576 --> 06:26.216
so as not to intimidate
the interviewees.

06:27.747 --> 06:31.582
I'm sure you're aware that a position at
the Osborn Academy is highly coveted.

06:31.949 --> 06:34.902
So, what makes you think you have
what it takes to be a student here?

06:34.980 --> 06:36.465
My name is
John Jameson,

06:36.543 --> 06:39.013
and not only am
I studying astrophysics,

06:39.153 --> 06:42.582
but so far, the Space Agency
has already adopted

06:42.683 --> 06:44.278
two of my ideas,

06:44.388 --> 06:46.419
while I've adopted
their motto,

06:46.590 --> 06:48.880
"Failure is not an option."

06:49.005 --> 06:51.846
Well, as the son of the
brilliant Spencer Smythe,

06:51.984 --> 06:54.770
I already have the genes
for excellence.

06:54.949 --> 06:57.061
Hey, what's up, bro?
I'm Flash Thompson,

06:57.177 --> 06:59.056
and my genes...
are denim.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.825
Because I'm super smart,
is why.

07:02.027 --> 07:03.872
Don't you already go
to Horizon?

07:04.012 --> 07:06.145
What?
I'm covering my bases.

07:06.644 --> 07:09.302
Herman and I are best friends,
so we work well together.

07:09.527 --> 07:12.372
What Clayton's trying to say is
that, like a chemical compound,

07:12.442 --> 07:15.130
we act as each other's catalysts
for conceiving great ideas.

07:15.325 --> 07:19.278
Right. In fact, we inspired each other
to create this awesome new tech.

07:19.653 --> 07:22.536
I call mine Clash-Tech because
it can manipulate sound.

07:22.699 --> 07:24.388
And I've created these gauntlets
I call

07:24.436 --> 07:27.153
Shockers that allow me
to control vibrations.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.120
Charging.

07:40.934 --> 07:42.325
Voila.

07:46.285 --> 07:48.285
Very impressive, young men.

07:48.675 --> 07:49.972
Mr. Osborn.

07:50.154 --> 07:53.347
But do you have the drive
to outshine the competition?

07:53.573 --> 07:54.832
- Yes, sir.
- Absolutely.

07:54.964 --> 07:59.182
Good. Because I'm only
going to take one of you.

08:01.675 --> 08:03.820
Wait. What?
But we're a team.

08:04.232 --> 08:06.923
And I'm looking
for a solo act.

08:07.060 --> 08:10.529
So whoever impresses me the most
will get to be a student here.

08:11.029 --> 08:12.373
Understood?

08:13.638 --> 08:17.451
Mr. Osborn, Clayton and I have
worked together a long time.

08:17.529 --> 08:18.606
And, and...

08:18.654 --> 08:21.044
Hey! Sorry, man.
Must have slipped.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.669
You did that on purpose.
I did not.

08:23.756 --> 08:25.951
You know the activation switch
sticks a little.

08:26.113 --> 08:27.536
But it can totally be fixed.

08:27.669 --> 08:31.152
Yeah, it's true. It just
needs a boost from my...

08:32.293 --> 08:33.442
What are you doing?

08:33.530 --> 08:35.414
I-I was trying to help.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.485
Yeah, help yourself
get into this school.

08:39.453 --> 08:40.634
Ah!

08:40.726 --> 08:42.899
Ow.
Herman, I'm sorry.

08:42.995 --> 08:44.173
I overreacted.

08:44.282 --> 08:45.461
Get away from me.

08:50.318 --> 08:51.318
But I didn't mean

08:51.375 --> 08:53.632
- to hurt you.
- I said get away from me!

08:53.999 --> 08:56.045
Activate safe zone.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.952
Package is in the box.

09:03.772 --> 09:05.061
Clayton, I'm sorry.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.116
We're even.
Let's stop here.

09:07.928 --> 09:09.991
Oh, we are not even.

09:10.131 --> 09:11.272
Boosting.

09:12.138 --> 09:13.193
Whoa!

09:13.248 --> 09:15.107
Well, have it your way, then.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.327
So, is that all you got?

09:21.389 --> 09:23.146
These guys are
out of control.

09:23.194 --> 09:24.631
Oh. You want more?

09:28.749 --> 09:29.932
Pete!

09:31.759 --> 09:33.893
Don't need a costusome go.

09:37.408 --> 09:40.242
But, I can do more as...

09:42.002 --> 09:43.822
Spider-Man.

09:45.588 --> 09:46.987
That's enough, you two.

09:47.035 --> 09:48.345
If it wasn't
for my web-chutes,

09:48.393 --> 09:49.924
some innocent people
might have been hurt.

09:49.972 --> 09:51.668
We worked so hard
for this day, Herman.

09:51.775 --> 09:53.742
I can't believe you're
turning against me.

09:53.879 --> 09:55.182
Stop with the act.

09:55.230 --> 09:57.245
You know you turned on me first.

09:57.588 --> 10:00.166
They caused an electrical fire
in the biology lab.

10:00.214 --> 10:01.565
Stop! Don't hit the alarm!

10:01.613 --> 10:03.394
He'll manipulate the sound!

10:03.938 --> 10:07.005
I'll show you
the true power of sound.

10:07.282 --> 10:09.682
Clayton! I'm not against you.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.309
Then you shouldn't
have attacked me.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.580
Boosting beyond capacity.

10:14.690 --> 10:15.752
Uh-oh.

10:15.870 --> 10:18.673
He's about to unleash a sound bomb.
And for the record?

10:18.721 --> 10:21.002
I plan on using a web fan
to create a wind cushion.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.783
Or a net.
Just create a net!

10:23.893 --> 10:25.182
Oh, right.

10:25.604 --> 10:27.354
Okay, bring it on.

10:34.499 --> 10:35.546
Huh?

10:35.594 --> 10:36.913
Everyone nice and stucky?

10:36.961 --> 10:38.819
So this spider kid
is auditioning too, huh?

10:38.867 --> 10:41.609
Then I need a bigger arena to show
off the full extent of my work.

10:43.218 --> 10:45.741
And may the best student win.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.898
Hey, who said I was
a student?

10:53.133 --> 10:54.624
And I'm not auditioning!

10:54.672 --> 10:56.047
Good.

10:56.273 --> 10:58.140
Because so far,
I'm not impressed.

10:58.811 --> 11:00.798
But... You...

11:06.039 --> 11:09.014
If you wanted out of this partnership,
Herman, you should've just said so.

11:09.070 --> 11:11.453
As opposed to sabotaging it,
like you did?

11:11.735 --> 11:13.022
You're the one
who wanted out.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.203
I just didn't realize
it included the friendship.

Sound supply empty.

11:30.944 --> 11:32.515
Ah!

11:35.257 --> 11:36.625
Need more sound.

11:41.164 --> 11:43.161
Power restored.

11:45.436 --> 11:47.269
How are you guys
gonna get into any school

11:47.317 --> 11:49.333
when you're stuck
in detention for 30 years?

11:49.747 --> 11:51.200
I don't know
who you are,

11:51.348 --> 11:52.926
but we were here first.

11:58.729 --> 12:02.104
Pete! How does a guy fall out
of a window and disappear?

12:08.241 --> 12:09.241
Mm.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.168
Uh-oh.

12:15.301 --> 12:18.090
She's gonna bl-blow!

12:24.652 --> 12:26.518
Oh! Look out!

12:31.186 --> 12:33.412
- Get off me.
- I was trying to help you.

12:33.537 --> 12:36.474
You're never helping. And what
did you do to my friend Pete?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.537
I webbed him a parachute.

12:38.694 --> 12:41.349
- He should be around here somewhere.
- Well, he's not.

12:41.463 --> 12:43.990
So, help me find him
or I'll tear you apart.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.904
I... I'm...

12:51.059 --> 12:53.482
I gotta...
I'll be right back.

13:00.357 --> 13:01.794
Whoa!

13:05.420 --> 13:07.344
Whoa whoa whoa!

13:07.422 --> 13:09.906
Huh?

13:10.196 --> 13:11.258
Whoo!

13:14.917 --> 13:19.438
Looks like we're all trying
to impress Norman Osborn.

13:23.492 --> 13:26.125
Time to see whose tech
has the strongest impact.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.946
I think we both know
the answer to that.

13:30.828 --> 13:32.438
Huh?

13:32.765 --> 13:33.788
Hey!

13:33.883 --> 13:35.082
What are you doing?

13:35.217 --> 13:37.017
You've never had
the power to do that.

13:37.123 --> 13:38.322
It's not me.

13:38.420 --> 13:40.320
Someone's siphoning the juice
from our tech.

13:40.368 --> 13:41.914
Not someone.

13:41.985 --> 13:43.318
The Jackal.

13:43.382 --> 13:46.883
With an assist
from Tony Stark, of course.

13:50.566 --> 13:52.547
I'll be taking that.

13:58.101 --> 13:59.117
Huh?

13:59.352 --> 14:01.602
Hey. No! Ah!

14:02.849 --> 14:06.406
And I'd hate to see
this hardware go to waste.

14:07.633 --> 14:09.774
Jackal? Don't tell me
you're auditioning

14:09.822 --> 14:11.227
for Osborn Academy too.

14:11.367 --> 14:14.087
They are gonna have
one crazy debate club.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.157
Ah!

14:19.547 --> 14:21.391
Oh, wow, that combined tech
is fierce.

14:21.469 --> 14:22.944
Don't want to feel that again.

14:23.232 --> 14:24.961
Going somewhere?

14:25.128 --> 14:26.672
That fur in your ears
must be thick.

14:26.735 --> 14:29.255
I said I didn't want
to feel that again.

14:31.861 --> 14:34.656
Spider-Man!
Aim for Clayton's chest plate.

14:34.704 --> 14:37.430
He hasn't worked out the bugs, and
it can't take a direct hit there.

14:37.478 --> 14:41.063
Hey! That's a side effect
of design, not bad planning.

14:45.988 --> 14:49.274
While you're at it, crush the
wristband of Herman's gauntlet.

14:49.415 --> 14:51.500
That's where he houses
the power source.

14:51.636 --> 14:55.008
Thanks, fellas! The question
is how do I get near him?

14:55.793 --> 14:57.883
Of course! A worker
can withstand

14:57.950 --> 14:59.789
the vibrations
of that jackhammer

14:59.840 --> 15:01.280
because he's wearing
shock absorbers.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.906
Ha!

15:04.840 --> 15:06.703
I'm guessing about a 36 medium.

15:06.986 --> 15:09.019
Ah, let's just go
full marshmallow suit.

15:09.156 --> 15:10.844
Whoa! Oh!

15:11.026 --> 15:13.219
Huh. Might not be
graceful enough

15:13.289 --> 15:15.766
to get into the ballet,
but should do the trick.

15:15.977 --> 15:18.149
He leaps, he rolls,
he waddles!

15:18.688 --> 15:20.696
Whoa!

15:21.063 --> 15:22.796
He-hey! It worked!

15:23.086 --> 15:24.250
How?

15:26.099 --> 15:27.836
I take this.

15:34.305 --> 15:36.836
Need to shed a
few pounds, and fast.

15:40.799 --> 15:43.821
Herman, if this is it,
I'm sorry.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.336
I'm sorry too.
You're my best friend.

15:46.531 --> 15:51.406
Aww. I can't separate
such devoted pals.

15:51.754 --> 15:54.266
So I'll take you both out!

15:57.259 --> 16:01.470
Man, I am not a fan
of these split-second decisions.

16:01.642 --> 16:04.626
But a different fan
might finally work here.

16:17.012 --> 16:19.012
That's twice now
he's gotten away.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.727
We're so sorry, man. Yeah.
I don't know what got into us.

16:22.814 --> 16:25.454
- We just got carried away.
- Well, you're about to be carried

16:25.525 --> 16:27.758
back to Osborn Academy
to face the music.

16:27.834 --> 16:30.641
Wait. Do we have to be airborne?

16:30.825 --> 16:33.385
Yeah, I've had my fill
of flying for one day.

16:35.097 --> 16:39.641
Huh. And I seem to have used up all
my web fluid on that web suit.

16:40.001 --> 16:42.227
So, it looks like
you're getting your way.

16:46.144 --> 16:47.625
I still can't find Peter.

16:47.681 --> 16:50.094
Hey! How did you
get out of my webs?

16:50.477 --> 16:51.602
Wasn't so hard.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.517
We just whipped up
a simple chemical compound,

16:53.565 --> 16:54.805
and they dissolved
pretty quick.

16:54.853 --> 16:55.919
Really?

16:55.967 --> 16:57.571
We'll take these two.

16:57.949 --> 17:00.899
I'd like to say that while they
do deserve to be reprimanded,

17:00.980 --> 17:03.696
these boys helped me get the
stolen tech back from the Jackal.

17:03.907 --> 17:05.391
So, I vote
for some leniency.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.523
No charges need to be filed.

17:07.605 --> 17:09.204
I am responsible.

17:09.368 --> 17:10.898
I egged them on.

17:11.144 --> 17:12.930
They were merely giving
the type of audition

17:12.978 --> 17:16.440
I'd expect from a student
of Osborn Academy.

17:16.989 --> 17:18.359
That being said,

17:18.750 --> 17:20.430
welcome aboard, young man.

17:20.532 --> 17:23.602
Your Shocker technology
is very impressive.

17:23.799 --> 17:25.329
Yes!

17:25.435 --> 17:27.568
Better luck next year.

17:28.188 --> 17:30.446
This is no way
to run a school, Norman.

17:30.555 --> 17:32.860
Pushing the boundaries
of science is one thing.

17:32.987 --> 17:36.956
But crossing ethical lines is not
something you want to encourage.

17:37.274 --> 17:40.477
Competition breeds
excellence, Max.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.835
I'm surprised
you don't know that.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.102
But you run your school
the way you want to,

17:45.150 --> 17:48.446
and I'll run mine the way
successful people do.

17:50.391 --> 17:52.266
Let's go, everyone.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.183
Wait. Whatever happened
to Peter?

18:03.297 --> 18:06.052
Oh. He, uh, landed safely
a few blocks away

18:06.087 --> 18:08.602
with, uh, one
of my web parachutes.

18:08.977 --> 18:11.090
Oh. All right.
Then let's go.

18:11.219 --> 18:15.118
By the way, I wound up using
that fan maneuver you suggested.

18:15.197 --> 18:16.305
It helped save the day.

18:16.353 --> 18:17.805
Of course it did.

18:17.898 --> 18:21.000
Too bad I couldn't help you stop the
Jackal from getting away again.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.610
Ouch.

18:24.172 --> 18:25.914
But I got the Stark tech back.

18:26.045 --> 18:27.388
So that's a...

18:28.329 --> 18:30.727
Who am I kidding?
She's right.

18:30.978 --> 18:33.547
It's not a win until I bring
the Jackal in.

18:36.446 --> 18:38.039
Web fluid.

18:38.681 --> 18:41.821
Today feels
like a long way down.

18:49.321 --> 18:50.471
Trouble, son?

18:50.537 --> 18:52.500
I just don't trust
that guy, Dad.

18:52.689 --> 18:54.430
He's been nothing
but bad news.

18:54.576 --> 18:57.610
And I'm sure he had something to
do with me getting suspended.

18:57.969 --> 18:59.797
Put it all behind you, Harry.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.782
This is a brand-new beginning.

19:01.899 --> 19:04.007
But my work. My research.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.689
I invested a lot of time
at Horizon High.

19:06.993 --> 19:09.305
Now I have to start
all over.

19:10.141 --> 19:11.633
Walk with me, Harry.

19:12.258 --> 19:16.145
Son, the Osborn name will always
be associated with genius.

19:16.414 --> 19:17.969
Take today, for example.

19:18.127 --> 19:21.196
When the smartest school around
no longer wanted you,

19:21.296 --> 19:23.492
I created
an even smarter school.

19:23.594 --> 19:25.969
To save you
from the embarrassment.

19:26.063 --> 19:30.524
And if I have to take action to ensure that
your research from Horizon isn't lost...

19:31.641 --> 19:33.563
then I'll do that, too.

19:33.617 --> 19:35.550
My experiments
from Horizon.

19:35.877 --> 19:37.524
Whoa.

19:38.173 --> 19:39.505
You stole them?

19:39.667 --> 19:41.730
I appropriated them.

19:41.855 --> 19:43.925
If Horizon High
can't assure their security,

19:44.026 --> 19:47.588
I can at least make sure they
don't fall into the wrong hands.

19:47.902 --> 19:50.269
I don't know what to say.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.671
There's nothing to say.

19:52.936 --> 19:54.562
You're my son.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.601
I expect great things
from you, Harry.

19:57.886 --> 19:59.886
So, don't mess up again.

20:27.781 --> 20:28.974
Hey, Uncle Raymond.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.342
Sorry I'm late for dinner.

20:30.398 --> 20:32.101
I've had quite the day.

20:32.296 --> 20:35.114
That makes two of us, my dear.

20:42.990 --> 20:44.218
I don't know.

20:44.358 --> 20:46.311
As I was coming down,
the wind changed direction,

20:46.359 --> 20:48.656
and I landed directly
in the East River.

20:48.853 --> 20:50.898
I still can't get the smell
out of my clothes.

20:51.032 --> 20:54.328
I'm telling you, that
Spider-Man is no good.

20:54.453 --> 20:57.202
He saved my life, Harry.
And yours too.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.320
- Uh...
- Didn't he?

20:59.444 --> 21:02.320
Didn't someone say he
saved you or something?

21:02.435 --> 21:04.671
Pshh. Hmm.

21:04.849 --> 21:06.765
I'm still not convinced.

21:07.804 --> 21:09.859
So, we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

21:09.907 --> 21:11.827
That's the great thing
about us, isn't it, Harry?

21:11.901 --> 21:14.898
We can disagree about things
and still stay best friends.

21:15.179 --> 21:17.257
I can't believe those Shocker
and Clash guys

21:17.343 --> 21:18.976
turned on each other
the way they did.

21:19.281 --> 21:21.742
I know. To let
something like school

21:21.790 --> 21:24.656
get in the way of their
friendship is ridiculous.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.257
Let's never be like them.

21:27.906 --> 21:29.935
Never ever.
