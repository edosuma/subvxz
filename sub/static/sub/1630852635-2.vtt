You have the power to stop this.

This man wanted to bleed you dry.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.500
Take your power.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.208
Then I'll die with my brothers!

03:58.291 --> 04:00.958
A meaningless death.
You once told me to let go.

04:01.583 --> 04:04.041

There's a fort not far from here.

05:04.791 --> 05:06.875
They might have the medicine she needs.

[Mirana] We were attacked by the Coedwei.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.625
We barely made it out alive.

08:34.708 --> 08:37.791
Eh. Some more than others.

08:37.875 --> 08:41.375
We'll only stay long enough
to treat our wounded and resupply.

Well, that's not my decision.

08:44.083 --> 08:47.041
But for now, you can take her
to the infirmary.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.458
The rest can find food in the mess.

Thank you. The Nightsilver Woods
will remember your hospitality.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.625
I would speak to your captain.

Soon enough. Rest now.

The longer we stay here,
the more vulnerable we are.

I was paid to bring you in alive.
He didn't say in what condition.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.250
You killed all those people.

You wiped out this entire outpost,
all for a bounty.

But you ignore their pleas.

16:12.875 --> 16:17.000
You have achieved
what Slyrak himself could not.

16:17.083 --> 16:20.958
The destruction of the Dragon Knights.

16:21.666 --> 16:25.583
Oh, so many dead, Little Bit.

16:25.666 --> 16:29.958
Because you were foolish enough
to believe one lie,

16:30.041 --> 16:33.208
and make yourself part of another.

16:33.875 --> 16:37.875
Your destiny is to die
on someone else's quest.

16:38.541 --> 16:41.041
Serving someone else's glory.

16:42.083 --> 16:46.541
A sad, bit player in another man's story.

16:47.916 --> 16:50.166
Redemption stands in front of you.

16:50.791 --> 16:54.291
Clothed in the flesh of a man
you call "brother".

16:54.375 --> 17:01.000
Yet you hide behind an oath
and call your cowardice loyalty.

17:02.375 --> 17:05.875
There is only one thing left
for you to do.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.708
So far from your own battle.

17:08.791 --> 17:11.958
Hiding from the consequences.

17:12.041 --> 17:15.458
Will they remember you, dear Bram?

17:15.541 --> 17:20.416
Or simply bury you
next to all the other forgotten dead?

17:20.916 --> 17:26.833
Strike Slyrak down.
Free your brothers from their torment.

17:27.416 --> 17:32.166
Give in. Let go. Change your destiny.

17:32.750 --> 17:36.125
Free yourself.

17:36.958 --> 17:41.250
[Terrorblade as Father]
All you have to do is let me in.

17:43.416 --> 17:45.083
You were right.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.291
-Of course, you were right.

18:01.791 --> 18:05.000
[grunts, groans]

18:05.083 --> 18:08.250
[Terrorblade as Father]
Slyrak's soul is mine!

18:09.125 --> 18:14.250
And with it, the whole of creation!

18:14.333 --> 18:16.625
[screaming]

-Well played, Little Bit.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.750
[screams, grunts]

18:39.833 --> 18:42.250
[Terrorblade as Father laughing]

[dramatic music playing]

18:59.250 --> 19:00.333
[Fymryn grunts]

19:06.708 --> 19:07.583
Uh?

19:13.541 --> 19:14.916
[Father breathing heavily]

19:15.000 --> 19:17.750
[stammering]

19:19.166 --> 19:21.041
My sword.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.125
[breathing heavily]

19:24.583 --> 19:26.208
My life.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.875
[Father breathing heavily]

19:35.041 --> 19:36.458
[Terrorblade] Havoc.

19:40.416 --> 19:41.875
[growls]

19:42.375 --> 19:44.666
[action music playing]

19:45.458 --> 19:47.583

[pants, screams]

20:20.291 --> 20:21.208
[screams]

20:28.625 --> 20:29.833
Stay together.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.458
Look.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.208
[growls]

20:44.208 --> 20:46.500
[tense music playing]

20:56.583 --> 20:57.791
Rylai.

21:01.708 --> 21:03.500
Climb on! Hurry!

21:04.583 --> 21:06.041
[Slyvion] Flee.

21:06.125 --> 21:11.083
What the demon has corrupted,
I will cleanse with fire.

21:11.166 --> 21:12.833
That's what the demon wants.

21:12.916 --> 21:15.833
For us to stand and die,
so he can take you.

21:16.791 --> 21:19.166
We have to fight the true enemy.

21:19.250 --> 21:23.458
They are all my enemies.

21:23.541 --> 21:27.833
Davion. Come with us. Please!

21:27.916 --> 21:31.541
Slyrak did this to you for a reason.
But it can't be this.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.083
"Can't be this"?

21:35.583 --> 21:40.916
Bram. Best damn squire in Dragon Hold.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.041
[grandiose music playing]

21:49.708 --> 21:51.958
[rumbling]

22:06.375 --> 22:08.375
[suspenseful music]

22:10.458 --> 22:12.000
In you go, love.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.541
This one's full. Your ride's over there.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.833
No. Choose the moment.

22:26.916 --> 22:28.791
[grunts]

22:29.416 --> 22:34.250
Ah. "The Scourge of the Plains."
There's a hefty price on your head.

22:34.333 --> 22:38.125
Almost as big as the Princess.
Double if you're still alive.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.500
It's a long ride to the Helio Imperium,
Your Highness.

22:42.166 --> 22:43.958
Let's not keep your uncle waiting.

22:49.708 --> 22:50.791
[groans]

22:59.333 --> 23:00.791
[horse neighs]

23:11.083 --> 23:15.958
Wake, Vahdrak. Father of Chaos.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.291
[low growl]

23:19.375 --> 23:21.833
Your time has come.
