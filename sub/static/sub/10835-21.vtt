00:02.419 --> 00:03.586
Previously on 90210...
When are you coming
back to school?

00:03.711 --> 00:04.797
I'm not.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.465
I'm enrolling
at St. Clare's.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.633
Just need a fresh start.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.468
You're the whore
from the video!

00:09.593 --> 00:12.179
You filmed us having sex and
then showed it to everyone!

00:12.304 --> 00:14.055
I was in that movie, too.
Only instead of hiding,

00:14.181 --> 00:15.223
I dealt with all
the whispering

00:15.349 --> 00:16.391
and all the looks.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.476
And you're gonna
have to figure out

00:17.601 --> 00:18.727
how to do that, too.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.228
What I feel is humiliated.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.563
I feel like I'm in hell.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.231
Liam asked me out.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.692
What did you say?
Nothing.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.401
I just left.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.444
Well, thank you for telling me.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.445
I appreciate it.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.865
This is my sister,
this is Jen.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.616
Here I am to rescue her
from bourgeois hell.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.285
So, Adrianna Tate Duncan,

00:35.410 --> 00:36.453
will you please marry me?

00:36.578 --> 00:38.079
(giggling):
Okay.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.459
♪ ♪

00:52.845 --> 00:55.556
(sighing)

00:55.681 --> 00:57.016
So, Navid and I...

00:57.140 --> 00:59.768
We have something
to tell you guys.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.395
Something I already know.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.524
Uh, I'm not giving the
baby up for adoption.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.818
So, you're keeping it?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.403
Mm, wait for it.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.530
We are, actually.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.990
Navid and I.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.116
We're gonna raise
the baby together.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.618
And we're getting married.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.746
What?!
Married?!
(Dixon coughing)

01:18.871 --> 01:20.163
Like, married,
married?

01:20.288 --> 01:21.415
It's crazy, right?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.584
What?

01:23.709 --> 01:24.835
I am not gonna
sit here and pretend

01:24.960 --> 01:26.503
that I think
it's a good idea.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.505
If you want to keep
the baby, fine.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.673
If you want to
help out, fine.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.508
But married?!

01:31.633 --> 01:33.176
Help me here.

01:33.301 --> 01:37.639
You know, it does seem
a little drastic.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.016
We love each other.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.351
NAOMI: Things change! I mean,
look at Annie and Ethan.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.770
A couple months ago,
they were all

01:42.895 --> 01:45.773
love love love,
moon, moon, moon.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.357
Now they hardly
talk to each other.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.817
Okay, Naomi.
Naomi...

01:48.943 --> 01:51.361
NAOMI:
I'm sure it's fun

01:51.486 --> 01:53.238
playing house in your
bedroom and all...

01:53.363 --> 01:54.239
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.407
That's where you
guys are living?

01:55.532 --> 01:57.367
NAOMI: I know you
love him, Ade.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.536
But you have your
whole life ahead of you.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.748
Think of all the life events
you're gonna miss out on

02:02.873 --> 02:04.332
if you tie yourself down.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.417
Uh, there's college.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.544
I'm still gonna go to college.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.836
College parties.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.547
A summer in Europe.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.926
Or a love affair with a
tall, unshaven Italian man

02:14.051 --> 02:16.553
who cooks you
pasta puttanesca.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.721
It's not just Ade.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.098
Navid, you're gonna
miss out, too.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.641
No, I've never had a thing
for unshaven Italian men.

02:20.766 --> 02:21.850
Yeah, but--

02:21.976 --> 02:23.560
NAVID:
We love each other.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.896
I think we can offer
this kid a great family.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.109
Why not reconsidering
adoption, huh?

02:30.233 --> 02:32.987
I mean, there's tons of people
out there who can't have kids

02:33.112 --> 02:34.822
and are ready.
NAVID:
We're ready.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.657
We are, and we're gonna
be great parents.

02:36.782 --> 02:37.783
Hey, I'm done.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.618
You done?
Yeah, I am.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.203
I'll, uh,
see you guys later.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.371
Navid...

02:43.497 --> 02:44.790
Navid, I didn't mean it.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.378
(school bell rings)

02:50.504 --> 02:52.380
You okay?
Yeah, you?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.674
Yeah, totally.

02:53.799 --> 02:54.842
Yeah, me too, I'm good.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.468
Yeah, I'm, uh, really good.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.636
Oh, yeah?

02:57.761 --> 02:59.596
Well, I am great.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.223
Oh, who needs, uh, friends
or parents, right?

03:02.349 --> 03:03.558
We don't need any support.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.811
Right...

03:09.523 --> 03:12.526
Are you okay?

03:12.651 --> 03:15.194
I'm not so great.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.489
DIXON:
I'm just glad you
wanted to see me.

03:17.614 --> 03:21.409
And you know,
I'm sorry I pushed you,

03:21.535 --> 03:25.622
you know, to come
clean at your school.

03:25.747 --> 03:30.085
Oh, um, thanks.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.754
It's just a really
hard situation.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.799
Yeah, I know it is.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.426
And I should have been
a lot more sensitive.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.514
I mean, you've
been through a lot.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.766
So, however long
it takes you to

03:44.892 --> 03:49.396
be comfortable
in public or whatever,

03:49.521 --> 03:51.106
I'm cool with that.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.401
So, you're fine
just hanging out here?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.486
Yeah, totally.

03:56.611 --> 04:00.991
I mean, it's gonna make
going to prom tough,

04:01.116 --> 04:03.535
but maybe the prom committee
can move it here.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.870
That'd be nice.
Dixon, um, I can't...

04:04.995 --> 04:06.580
I can't go to prom.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.124
I'm... I can't deal with
West Beverly kids yet.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.670
But you want to go.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.718
Now you're just
making me feel guilty.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.596
(Dixon stuttering)

04:22.721 --> 04:24.098
I-I'm sorry.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.266
I shouldn't have even brought
it up; it was stupid.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.027
Oh, hi, Father.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.403
Thanks for coming.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.948
Well, your email
was rather insistent.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.491
A martini, please,
dry, two olives.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.287
So, I assume you're here because

04:47.412 --> 04:48.789
the Wilsons have had
enough of your shenanigans.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.625
Hmm.
I forgive you.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.418
And of course you can come home.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.628
In fact, I need you to.

04:54.753 --> 04:55.670
These are tough times
for the family

04:55.796 --> 04:56.964
and we need to
circle the wagons.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.882
It's a tough time for you.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.467
You're the one who sexually
harassed Portia's...

05:00.592 --> 05:02.636
(stammering):
Allegedly.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.055
I'm a family man, Naomi.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.766
I value family, morals,
clean living.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.434
(laughing):
What the hell?

05:09.559 --> 05:10.435
Don't blaspheme, Naomi.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.605
Jen, you're home!

05:13.730 --> 05:15.899
Sorry I haven't
called, Daddy.
How's school?

05:16.024 --> 05:19.236
Uh, well, I'm learning lots.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.737
I just-- Well, I've
had some time off

05:20.862 --> 05:22.530
so, I thought I'd
visit the old homestead.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.909
(stammering): Well, it's,
things are tough but, uh,

05:26.034 --> 05:27.161
I'm so glad you're here.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.954
You can come stay
with Gail and me

05:29.079 --> 05:30.705
and Naomi, of course.
How's that for a plan?

05:30.831 --> 05:34.751
Oh, I'm glad I'm here, too.

05:34.876 --> 05:38.672
But there's no way on earth
I'm going to rally around some

05:38.797 --> 05:41.508
narcissistic, freaky, old sexual
degenerate just because

05:41.633 --> 05:42.926
he happens to
be my father.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.179
And neither is Naomi.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.973
So, I have a slightly
different plan.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.432
I think Naomi should get

05:49.557 --> 05:50.851
the first installment
of her trust fund.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.894
Now.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.604
I mean, there's no reason
she should have to wait

05:54.729 --> 05:55.814
till she's 21 like I did.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.983
And there's certainly
no reason she should

05:58.108 --> 05:59.734
have to live with you.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.944
And "Gail."

06:01.069 --> 06:02.821
That's ridiculous, Naomi's 16.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.031
She can't sign a lease.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.200
But I can.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.659
Naomi and I are
going to live together.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.869
Why should I agree to that?

06:08.994 --> 06:11.788
Two words.

06:11.913 --> 06:16.584
Michele Braverman.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.752
Who's Michele Braverman?

06:17.878 --> 06:21.006
She was my tennis pro
when I was 16.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.674
Quite an attractive girl.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.760
Ruddy, robust, very...

06:25.886 --> 06:28.013
healthy, wasn't
she, Daddy?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.515
You give Naomi the money

06:30.640 --> 06:33.227
and we'll play the dutiful
little daughters.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.980
Fine.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.234
I'll have my business manager
send papers in the morning.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.864
Hey, Jen, um...

06:45.989 --> 06:49.534
Were you just saying that?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.119
I mean, do you really
want to live together?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.537
For real?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.623
Absolutely for real--
for real for real.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.417
Honey, I wouldn't abandon
you in your time of need.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.922
Okay, where do
you want to live?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.257
(laughing)

07:03.382 --> 07:05.175
Do you want to
live in Bel Air?

07:05.300 --> 07:07.010
Los Feliz, Malibu,
Hollywood Hills?

07:07.135 --> 07:10.597
I mean, the world is
our oyster, baby sister.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.433
To oysters.
To oysters.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.746
(school bell ringing)

07:34.871 --> 07:38.083
Oh, shoot, did you by any
chance grab my math homework

07:38.208 --> 07:40.501
off the dining room table?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.836
You're the best!

07:41.962 --> 07:43.797
That's what I
keep telling you.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.095
Oh, what's that?

07:50.220 --> 07:54.141
I have no idea.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.142
Open it up.

07:55.267 --> 07:59.104
Surprise, surprise.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.023
Oh, they're throwing
me a shower.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.192
NAOMI:
Just so we're clear,

08:04.318 --> 08:07.195
I still think you're
making a huge mistake.

08:07.321 --> 08:10.698
But you did stand by me when I
got those terrible highlights.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.826
So, if you're dead-set
on doing this,

08:12.951 --> 08:14.786
you're gonna need
your friends' support.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.122
We're not gonna abandon
you during your time of need.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.249
Thank you, so much.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.542
Thank you for the
party, oh, my God!

08:21.668 --> 08:23.128
Well, to be fair,
I'm footing the bill.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.755
Annie's just
lending her house.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.716
Just one sec. Come here.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.385
Um, we're having
the party at my house?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.179
'Cause I thought we were
having it at the Ivy.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.888
Oh, we were.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.599
But I also want Nobu sushi
and Sweet Lady Jane pastries.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.976
Catering means we
can have it all.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.727
Okay, great!

08:45.233 --> 08:46.818
Your dad's a pervert.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.236
Oh, yeah, he's
not my problem.

08:48.362 --> 08:52.032
Oh, and well, your mom's
a soap opera actress.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.741
(car remote beeps)

08:56.036 --> 08:57.787

Hey, just to be
on the safe side,

10:04.104 --> 10:05.897
I think you should get
checked out by a doctor.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.400
When I was living in Nice,
I knew this guy who took

10:08.525 --> 10:10.527
a champagne cork to
the eye and, well,

10:10.651 --> 10:11.945
he ended up having
to have surgery.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.071
He nearly lost his eye.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.364
Surgery?

10:14.489 --> 10:16.074
Well, his whole face collapsed.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.700
I mean, he had done so much blow

10:17.825 --> 10:19.202
that his face was
as hollow as a piñata.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.788
You know,

10:21.913 --> 10:23.790
one errant champagne
cork and whoop,

10:23.915 --> 10:26.667
the whole thing
kind of imploded.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.752
It's a cautionary tale.

Chagall Museum there.

Yeah.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.604
Adrianna.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.272
Mrs. Shirazi?

19:50.397 --> 19:53.151
I'm sorry. I know you're
having a party,

19:53.275 --> 19:56.029
but I haven't slept in days
and I had to talk to you.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.866
You're making
a terrible mistake.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.659
A terrible, terrible mistake.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.494
Please, hear me.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.663
You're not ready
to raise a baby.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.331
You're just a kid.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.959
You're not ready and
Navid is not ready.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.336
You're going to ruin your lives.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.338
And the child's too.
NAOMI:
All right!

20:14.463 --> 20:17.341
Get back here,
bride!

20:17.466 --> 20:19.259
I should...
Sure.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.429
Okay, but please don't
make this mistake.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.099
Please.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.312
(cheering, applause)

21:12.438 --> 21:13.522
DIXON:
You know, it's like

21:13.647 --> 21:14.982
she got... it's like she got

21:15.108 --> 21:16.067
this trump card, you know,

21:16.192 --> 21:17.777
because she's bipolar
or something.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.653
Not-Not that I
judge, you know.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.655
Not-Not that I
judge at all,

21:21.781 --> 21:25.034
but it's like... you
know, it-it's not fair.

21:25.159 --> 21:29.455
It's like... it's like, because
you have something wrong,

21:29.580 --> 21:31.624
like, I have to ask
you to prom, you know.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.127
Like, screw your mental
illness or whatever.

21:34.252 --> 21:37.964
Not that prom has anything to
do with mental illness or...

21:38.089 --> 21:40.299
I can't believe
you're getting married, Spencer.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.884
DIXON:
It's just like she
has this trump card.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.011
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.471
All right, Isabel,
You're up.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.014
Up for what?

21:47.140 --> 21:48.224
DIXON:
You know what I mean?

21:48.348 --> 21:50.309
It's... it... you
know, I don't...

21:50.434 --> 21:52.686
But... no.
Do you want to be
a Pi Nu or what?

21:52.812 --> 21:53.896
DIXON: Sometimes
it'd be cool.

21:54.021 --> 21:54.730
Sometimes
it'd be okay.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.065
Fine.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.191
DIXON:
I need another drink.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.904
(jazzy music playing)

22:02.029 --> 22:03.990
MAN:
Yeah, take it off.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.908
Take it off!

22:06.033 --> 22:07.451
(whistling)
MAN:
Oh, yeah.

22:08.702 --> 22:09.829
GIRLS:
Strip! Strip! Strip!

22:09.954 --> 22:12.706
MEN:
Take it off! Take it off!

22:12.832 --> 22:14.000
(whooping, hollering)

22:14.125 --> 22:16.585
Take it off!
Take it off!

22:16.710 --> 22:19.546
What are you waiting for?
I want to see everything!

22:22.633 --> 22:23.509
MAN:
Yeah.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.762
What are you doing?

22:26.887 --> 22:29.223
Something I hope I'm too drunk
to remember tomorrow.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.476
Uh... yeah, yeah!
(laughing, cheering)

22:32.601 --> 22:33.560
RYAN:
Nailed it.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.687
JEN:
Whoa.

22:34.812 --> 22:35.980
Impressive.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.439
It's all
in the wrist, yeah.

22:37.564 --> 22:38.899
I wish I could cook,

22:39.025 --> 22:40.943
but it just... it seems
like awfully hard work.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.321
Yeah.
And, you know...

22:43.445 --> 22:46.115
why work when you can live
off your trust fund?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.450
You're preaching
to the choir, babe.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.619
Oh, you're a Jonathan
Safran Foer fan.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.080
You know what, uh,
taste this really quick.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.959
Have you read his stuff?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.085
Or, uh, let me guess.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.545
You hung out with him in Dubai.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.963
Okay, that was amazing.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.673
And, uh, no.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.051
I didn't hang out with
Jonathan Safran Foer in Dubai.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.053
I find Dubai
revolting.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.055
We hang out
in Brooklyn.
Hmm.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.597
Oh, you know what I'll do?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.474
I'll send him your novel.

23:14.392 --> 23:17.437
I mean, yeah, that would...
that, uh... it's a good idea.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.939
So, when do I
get to read it?

23:19.065 --> 23:21.108
Uh, my novel?

23:21.234 --> 23:23.152
Yeah.
(chuckling)

23:23.277 --> 23:24.862
Soon... yeah, totally.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.488
(clears throat)

23:26.613 --> 23:28.157
Do you want another glass
of, uh, wine?

23:28.282 --> 23:29.575
Oh, we kicked
that bottle.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.077
I'll open a new one.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.746
I can't cook,
but I am a genius

23:33.871 --> 23:34.663
at opening red
wine bottles.

23:34.788 --> 23:35.915
Mm-hmm.

23:36.040 --> 23:36.916
Spencer!
Way to be, Spence.

23:37.041 --> 23:37.958
Way to be, buddy.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.626
(cheering, clapping)

23:39.752 --> 23:42.671
(whooping, cheering)

23:42.796 --> 23:44.757
Spencer!

23:44.882 --> 23:46.466
(whooping)
Yeah!

23:46.592 --> 23:47.176
Ah, yes, yes!

23:47.301 --> 23:48.594
(music ends)

23:48.719 --> 23:50.679
ANNOUNCER:
Please welcome to the stage

23:50.804 --> 23:51.931
Terryl and his pal Bose.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.058
Thank you.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.142
No, it was my pleasure.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.102
It's always fun to discover

23:56.227 --> 23:57.853
hidden talents.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.021
Hey, Spencer?

24:00.898 --> 24:03.317
(whispering): I don't think
you should get married.

24:07.905 --> 24:08.948
You don't?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.657
You're too young...

24:10.783 --> 24:12.450
and too cute.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.080
Isabel?

24:16.205 --> 24:18.832
(sighs)
I got to go.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.751
I'm coming.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.047
Oh, wait, don't forget this.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.841
DIXON:
Hey.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.135
Whoa.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.677
Where are
the girls going?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.012
LIAM:
Whoa, easy does
it, Manuel.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.180
I just need some
more tequila.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.266
Tequila.
Hey, I got to go.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.809
I really need to talk
to Adrianna right now.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.018
Yeah, yeah, we can go.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.186
Uh, let's just get the check.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.813
No... no way.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.731
I-I don't want...
I don't want to go home.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.858
I don't... I don't want
to see my girlfriend.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.526
I... no, no.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.820
All right, you
guys head back.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.155
I'll party with
Manuel here.

24:49.280 --> 24:49.947
Hey, thanks
for everything, guys.

24:50.072 --> 24:50.990
Appreciate it.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.158
Uh-uh.
No.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.742
No worries.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.494
This party is on Leo Briganti.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.091
This looks like
a fun little box.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.135
Baby girl.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.219
And this will be useful.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.595
(laughter)

25:15.055 --> 25:16.015
Yay, the groom's here!

25:16.140 --> 25:17.057
Can I talk to you?

25:17.183 --> 25:18.142
Yeah.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.310
(glass clinking)

25:19.435 --> 25:21.103
NAOMI:
I want to make a toast

25:21.228 --> 25:23.189
to the bride and groom.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.024
(giggling)

25:25.149 --> 25:26.650
Future mother and father.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.194
It is no secret

25:28.319 --> 25:29.653
that I thought
this was

25:29.778 --> 25:31.905
a terrible idea-- the
whole marriage thing--

25:32.031 --> 25:34.033
but recently, I have been
thinking a lot about family.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.243
My sister, Jen...
she just flew in from Paris,

25:36.369 --> 25:39.455
and we're going to live together
in the most amazing house and...

25:39.579 --> 25:42.041
having a good family
is so important.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.917
Adrianna, Navid...

25:44.043 --> 25:45.794
you two aren't going
to be a couple anymore.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.880
You're going to be a family--
that's huge--

25:48.005 --> 25:51.675
so, as much as I hate to say it,
I have to admit I was wrong.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.926
I was.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.761
I believe in you two.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.596
You'll make
this work.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.890
You'll make a wonderful
family together.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.100
So, Ade...

26:00.226 --> 26:02.186
I better be your maid of honor.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.063
I will not wear yellow.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.189
I love you.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.732
I love you both.

26:06.857 --> 26:07.774
Cheers.

26:07.900 --> 26:08.942
ALL:
Cheers.

26:09.068 --> 26:09.985
NAOMI:
Navid!

26:10.110 --> 26:11.195
It's time for

26:11.320 --> 26:12.946
"How Much Do You Know
About Your Bride?"

26:13.072 --> 26:14.198
Come on.

26:14.323 --> 26:15.115
Sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.116
Go.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.743
All right.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.328
You have the stuff, Annie?

26:19.453 --> 26:21.997
ANNIE:
Yeah, I've got
the questions.

26:26.043 --> 26:26.919
Ethan, hey.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.212
Hey, you.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.130
So, we meet again
on the outskirts of a party.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.549
True enough.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.008
I'm just here, uh,
dropping off Navid.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.134
Oh, right.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.635
Where's Dixon?

26:35.761 --> 26:38.138
Uh, Dixon is...

26:38.264 --> 26:42.184
well, uh, Dixon is
currently very drunk.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.810
Dixon is?

26:45.438 --> 26:47.273
This is all my fault.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.816
Uh... you okay?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.151
(sighs)

26:51.277 --> 26:53.028
We just haven't been...

26:53.153 --> 26:54.988
getting along so well.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.366
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.368
It's like we are so far apart.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.619
So disconnected.

27:03.830 --> 27:07.084
You want to hear my
relationship theory?

27:07.209 --> 27:09.627
You know how they say
no man is an island?

27:09.753 --> 27:12.923
Well, I think, actually,
every man is an island.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.133
Oh, yeah?

27:14.258 --> 27:15.426
And...

27:15.551 --> 27:19.054
relationships are like bridges.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.974
One guy builds one half
of the bridge,

27:22.099 --> 27:23.976
and the other guy--

27:24.101 --> 27:27.813
or, uh, gal,
you know-- um...

27:27.938 --> 27:29.982
builds the other half,

27:30.107 --> 27:33.402
and they try to
meet in the middle.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.904
But sometimes...

27:36.029 --> 27:38.365
the islands are
too far apart.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.829
And it's sad, but...

27:43.954 --> 27:46.165
it happens.

27:46.290 --> 27:50.252
That's okay, because...

27:50.377 --> 27:53.880
sometimes, it's just...
time to move on.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.927
I don't know--
maybe I'm just talking nonsense.

27:59.052 --> 27:59.886
No... (wry laugh)

28:01.138 --> 28:02.680
No, you're not.

28:03.974 --> 28:04.975
I'm not?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.810
No.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.521
You're right.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.566
I haven't been doing my share.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.861
Dixon has been making
all the compromises.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.489
He's been building
the bridge all himself.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.407
I've got to start
doing my part

28:20.533 --> 28:21.908
if this relationship
is going to work.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.038
Thank you, Ethan.

28:26.163 --> 28:29.041
No problem.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.626
JEN:
It's pretty here.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.794
RYAN:
Yeah, well,
it's not Nice.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.004
But it's nice.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.882
(both chuckling)

28:37.007 --> 28:39.051
Can I tell you something?
Mm-hmm.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.178
I've had fun tonight.
Hmm...

28:41.303 --> 28:44.056
(laughing):
A lot of fun.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.140
(shudders)

28:45.265 --> 28:46.975
Well, I'm glad.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.561
Me, too.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.980
I, uh...

28:52.105 --> 28:53.940
should tell
you something.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.067
Okay.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.360
I'm scared.

28:56.485 --> 28:59.279
I didn't write a novel.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.156
Oh, you lied?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.701
I, uh... I do
write-- I do.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.078
It's just that calling
myself a writer

29:06.203 --> 29:08.372
is like... is like calling
myself a mountain climber

29:08.497 --> 29:10.332
because I've hiked up
Runyon Canyon a couple times.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.000
Oh.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.670
But we're all

(chuckles)

31:05.572 --> 31:07.115
Yeah, why?

31:07.240 --> 31:10.577
Well, either because
A) you're just not that into her

31:10.703 --> 31:13.372
and you're not man enough
to be honest about it,

31:13.497 --> 31:15.499
or B) you actually do like her

31:15.624 --> 31:17.584
and you're not man enough
to handle it.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.085
Oh... so that's your theory?

31:19.211 --> 31:20.754
Yeah.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.508

well, you're not much of a man.

32:11.388 --> 32:14.391
W-We ended up going
to this burlesque club

32:14.516 --> 32:16.351
and I started talking
to this sorority girl

32:16.476 --> 32:20.272
and even she was telling me
that I shouldn't get married,

32:20.397 --> 32:22.482
and I have to admit
I started thinking about it--

32:22.608 --> 32:24.984
dating other people.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.153

all that looking.

we were making a huge mistake.

listen to her.

I did afterwards.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.664
