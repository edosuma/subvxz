00:04.559 --> 00:06.964
* *

00:10.977 --> 00:12.881
Kowalski, progress report.

00:12.951 --> 00:15.854
Nearing completion on escape
tunnel number 15, Skipper.

00:15.921 --> 00:17.657
Isn't this a bit overly cautious?

00:17.725 --> 00:18.617
Even better.

00:18.684 --> 00:20.368
It's full-blown paranoia.

00:20.435 --> 00:23.807
No, I mean, we already
have 14 escape tunnels.

00:23.875 --> 00:25.099
Isn't that enough?

00:25.166 --> 00:27.316
Manfredi and Johnson thought so,

00:27.386 --> 00:30.380
what was left of them came
home in a manila envelope.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.229
From Manila, ironically.

00:32.296 --> 00:34.834
There's no such thing as
"too paranoid", Private.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.004
Remember that.

00:36.071 --> 00:37.697
And forget you ever heard it.

00:37.764 --> 00:40.616
Um, I don't think that works
the way you think it...

00:40.684 --> 00:42.353
Eyes on the flippers.

00:42.421 --> 00:43.321
Wow!

00:45.607 --> 00:46.447
Man down!

00:46.514 --> 00:47.251
Rico.

00:48.999 --> 00:51.665
His brain appears to be
functioning at, uh...

00:51.733 --> 00:54.546
Hmm, let's call it normal capacity.

00:54.613 --> 00:55.511
What happened?

00:55.578 --> 00:57.166
I thought we mapped this tunnel.

00:57.234 --> 00:58.235
I'm not sure.

00:58.303 --> 00:59.772
This wall shouldn't be...

01:01.075 --> 01:02.883
A vintage pass code lock.

01:02.950 --> 01:04.312
Excellent work, Kowalski.

01:04.763 --> 01:05.758
But can you open it?

01:05.912 --> 01:10.892
Well, it is state of the art
hyper encryption technology...

01:11.932 --> 01:13.912
From 1963.

01:18.997 --> 01:19.813
Nailed it.

01:20.595 --> 01:22.347
Move in cautiously, men.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.551
Rico, ominous background music.

01:32.966 --> 01:33.625
Ah!

01:33.692 --> 01:34.241
Rico!

01:34.308 --> 01:36.243
All right, crackerjack,
what's the code word?

01:39.878 --> 01:41.595
Lucky guess, moonbeam.

01:42.134 --> 01:43.225
That voice...

01:43.292 --> 01:45.353
That steely gaze...

01:45.422 --> 01:47.123
You sugar puffs just
gonna stand there?

01:47.191 --> 01:48.660
Spill your tater tots.

01:48.727 --> 01:51.009
Where's the red squirrel?

01:51.076 --> 01:52.166
The red squirrel.

01:52.233 --> 01:53.968
Then you really are...

01:54.036 --> 01:56.272
Special agent Buck Rotgut.

01:56.339 --> 01:58.443
The Buck Rotgut?

01:58.510 --> 02:01.077
Um, is that... is that
someone famous, then?

02:01.144 --> 02:03.187
Sweet ignorant Private,

02:03.254 --> 02:06.121
Buck Rotgut is our greatest
American penguin hero.

02:06.189 --> 02:08.933
I've patterned my whole
life after Rotgut.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.575
The bird who brought down
penguin enemy number one:

02:11.642 --> 02:13.231
the red squirrel.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.534
And may I say, it is an honor, sir.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.604
86 the kiss-up, fauntleroy.

02:17.672 --> 02:19.297
Let's get to brass tacks.

02:19.364 --> 02:21.444
I caught the squirrel, all right,

02:21.511 --> 02:23.030
But big red broke out,

02:23.231 --> 02:24.941
Disappeared in the underground.

02:27.253 --> 02:29.488
47 years I've been
down in this bunker,

02:29.555 --> 02:32.358
waiting for red squirrel to
show his fluffy tail again.

02:32.426 --> 02:33.912
47 years.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.325
47 years?

02:35.392 --> 02:37.325
47 years!

02:37.392 --> 02:39.601
Don't you think the red squirrel
would have shown up by now?

02:39.668 --> 02:40.403
Private.

02:40.470 --> 02:41.584
College boy, huh?

02:41.983 --> 02:43.231
You see that bunker door?

02:43.474 --> 02:46.626
It only opens when the
red squirrel returns.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.158
Is it open now, dough boy?

02:49.447 --> 02:50.110
Yes.

02:50.316 --> 02:52.671
Then red is back.

02:53.079 --> 02:55.621
And you four lollipops are
gonna help me find him.

02:55.689 --> 02:57.534
I get to work with Buck Rotgut.

02:57.601 --> 02:58.776
I know, right?

03:00.161 --> 03:02.678
Okay, so the guy in the street,

03:02.745 --> 03:05.800
He puts a little ball
into one hat like this.

03:05.969 --> 03:08.605
Then he mix, he mix it so fast

03:08.672 --> 03:10.741
it's like you can't even see it.

03:10.892 --> 03:11.945
Then stop.

03:12.093 --> 03:14.888
And now you can't tell which
is the ball hat, can you?

03:15.548 --> 03:16.690
Oh.

03:16.942 --> 03:19.709
Oh. Ah! Oh!

03:21.011 --> 03:24.243
And now you give to
me all of your money.

03:24.310 --> 03:26.321
I love this game.

03:27.110 --> 03:28.744
You sure you playing this right?

03:29.821 --> 03:30.879
Where's the red squirrel?

03:33.716 --> 03:34.637
Bring him up.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.918
All right, pigeon, sing for me.

03:36.985 --> 03:37.782
Uh...

03:37.849 --> 03:39.520
* I don't know *

03:39.588 --> 03:42.441
* where the red squirrel is *

03:42.591 --> 03:44.391
* but this one time *

03:44.458 --> 03:47.516
* I found a piece of red licorice *

03:47.583 --> 03:48.794
I don't understand, Skipper.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.963
Why would Mort know anything
about the red squirrel?

03:51.031 --> 03:53.232
You got to think like
Buck Rotgut, Private.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.759
Put your paranoia cap on.

03:54.826 --> 03:56.817
I don't think I have a
paranoia cap, Skipper.

03:56.884 --> 03:58.185
Well, there's your problem.

03:58.252 --> 04:01.104
You don't know anything
about the red squirrel, huh?

04:01.171 --> 04:03.134
That bushy tail of yours
tells me different.

04:03.304 --> 04:05.402
Know who else has a bushy tail?

04:05.470 --> 04:06.770
The red squirrel!

04:07.642 --> 04:09.072
Oh, it's true.

04:09.140 --> 04:11.214
I do have a tail.

04:11.281 --> 04:13.343
Sad eyes, a squirrel spy?

04:14.508 --> 04:16.201
It's always the ones
you least expect.

04:16.267 --> 04:17.161
But... but...

04:17.228 --> 04:20.011
Ah, there you are, Mort, you silly.

04:20.077 --> 04:22.893
Come, I must show you
my new street game.

04:23.255 --> 04:25.119
Eh, who's the freak?

04:25.347 --> 04:27.287
I confess to everything.

04:27.355 --> 04:29.500
I took the last nut and nougat bar.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.356
I cheat at whistling.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.911
My father was not a
talking water cycle.

04:35.978 --> 04:38.011
This hardball stuff really works.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.063
These snitches don't know anything.

04:40.212 --> 04:42.121
They're just small potatoes.

04:42.188 --> 04:43.146
He's right.

04:43.399 --> 04:45.690
I am secretly a potato.

04:45.757 --> 04:47.736
No... oh... okay, no,
that one was a lie.

04:47.804 --> 04:49.521
I just wanted to get the ropes off.

04:49.588 --> 04:50.886
- Eh!
- Ow!

04:50.953 --> 04:52.579
Oh! Uh!

04:52.733 --> 04:54.844
These walls are nothing.

04:54.982 --> 04:57.550
There's not been the prison built

04:57.617 --> 04:59.585
that can hold King Julian.

05:00.326 --> 05:02.492
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're locking that?

05:02.559 --> 05:04.054
Never mind.

05:04.121 --> 05:06.224
Am I the only one who
thinks this is wrong?

05:06.376 --> 05:07.892
Oh, it's very wrong, Private.

05:07.959 --> 05:11.037
Who knew the red squirrel had so
many agents Inside our own zoo?

05:11.229 --> 05:13.229
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

05:15.365 --> 05:16.819
Dry those water works, egghead.

05:16.886 --> 05:18.537
This roundup's just
getting started.

05:18.748 --> 05:21.335
You diaper dons ready to
get your flippers dirty?

05:21.669 --> 05:23.270
<i>- Oh, absolutamente.
- Yeah.</i>

05:23.338 --> 05:24.204
Not really.

05:27.542 --> 05:29.276
Oh, all right.

05:29.344 --> 05:30.835
Free peanuts.

05:31.514 --> 05:33.111
You like peanuts, huh?

05:33.179 --> 05:35.146
You know who else likes nuts?

05:35.214 --> 05:36.614
The red squirrel!

05:37.716 --> 05:38.648
Oh, dear.

05:38.716 --> 05:39.878
Hey.

05:40.511 --> 05:41.113
Oof.

05:41.931 --> 05:43.585
Huh? What in the world?..

05:43.652 --> 05:44.252
Ah!

05:45.261 --> 05:47.729
You like pictures of
red squirrels, huh?

05:47.987 --> 05:50.586
You know who else
likes red squirrels?

05:50.791 --> 05:51.986
The red squirrel!

05:53.854 --> 05:55.293
Ah! Gah!

05:58.131 --> 05:59.027
I say.

05:59.334 --> 06:01.030
Read any good books lately, punks?

06:01.098 --> 06:02.998
Read? Red?

06:03.066 --> 06:04.533
The red squirrel!

06:05.506 --> 06:07.165
That one doesn't even make sense.

06:07.303 --> 06:08.569
Ah! Ow!

06:08.637 --> 06:10.404
But these are our friends.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.837
They can't be red squirrel agents.

06:12.904 --> 06:13.958
Can't they?

06:14.175 --> 06:15.938
I think we can trust the instincts

06:16.005 --> 06:17.744
of history's greatest
penguin agent.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.115
Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel...

06:20.516 --> 06:22.427
I'm sick of this guy.
He's not the boss of me.

06:22.494 --> 06:23.917
- They can't do this.
- It's outrageous.

06:23.984 --> 06:28.300
Okay, this red squirrel
stuff has gone way too far.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.901
But maybe we can stop it.

06:30.968 --> 06:32.826
I don't much like our chances.

06:32.894 --> 06:34.758
Those penguins are a wiley bunch.

06:34.825 --> 06:37.865
True, true,
but I just happen to have

06:37.932 --> 06:40.333
a secret inside source.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.436
Now, for his own protection,

06:42.503 --> 06:44.865
my source cannot
reveal his identity.

06:45.958 --> 06:47.231
Hello there, Private.

06:47.404 --> 06:48.154
Oh.

06:48.221 --> 06:50.192
Um, the way I see it,

06:50.259 --> 06:51.777
everything goes back to normal

06:51.845 --> 06:54.391
If we just get rid of Buck Rotgut.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.814
And how are we gonna do that?

06:55.882 --> 06:57.582
That guy's not going
anywhere until he catches

06:57.650 --> 06:58.949
some kind of red squirrel.

06:59.017 --> 07:00.660
Precisely, Maurice.

07:01.269 --> 07:03.745
So you want me to pretend
to be a squirrel?

07:03.812 --> 07:04.865
You are a squirrel.

07:04.932 --> 07:07.856
Yeah, but I never been
a pretend one before.

07:07.923 --> 07:08.785
It'll be fine.

07:08.852 --> 07:09.885
Ow.

07:11.487 --> 07:13.150
Ooh, everyone, come quickly.

07:13.217 --> 07:14.457
It's the red squirrel.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.463
Sweet enemy of the state.

07:19.684 --> 07:20.831
It's really him.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.772
Hope you kept your dance
card open, bushy tail,

07:23.963 --> 07:26.408
'cause I'm gonna play
a little chin music

07:26.476 --> 07:29.611
and waltz you all the way
back to the louse house.

07:29.755 --> 07:31.151
Um, I'm gonna run away now.

07:31.445 --> 07:32.831
After him, boys.

07:33.425 --> 07:36.182
Take him out.

07:36.249 --> 07:37.229
Oh, mama.

07:38.272 --> 07:41.319
Oh, okay, only 100 yards
to the nearest tree.

07:42.235 --> 07:43.803
Stupid eye patch.

07:44.705 --> 07:46.723
Crazy face,
hit me with the gift box.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.158
Ha.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.625
A-hi.

07:53.886 --> 07:56.132
Good job, all of us.

07:58.932 --> 08:01.540
I'm sure they kept
your cell warm, red.

08:01.608 --> 08:03.336
Heh-heh-heh.

08:04.879 --> 08:06.167
Touche, heh-heh.

08:06.580 --> 08:09.295
So what's our next mission, Buck?

08:10.011 --> 08:11.719
That's it for me, boys.

08:11.857 --> 08:13.184
I'm out of the game.

08:13.252 --> 08:14.198
- Why?
- No, sir.

08:14.265 --> 08:15.037
Say it ain't so.

08:15.104 --> 08:18.151
I was put on this earth for one
reason and one reason only.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.264
And now it's sitting
in the back of the...

08:20.331 --> 08:21.190
Wait a minute.

08:21.258 --> 08:22.381
Where's dough boy?

08:22.448 --> 08:23.934
Private? He's right...

08:24.141 --> 08:25.083
Hmm.

08:25.351 --> 08:26.696
Thanks a million, Fred.

08:26.764 --> 08:27.764
No problem.

08:27.832 --> 08:29.833
I always wanted to ride in a box.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.918
You know, they got cardboard
on the inside too.

08:33.337 --> 08:34.573
Conspiracy.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.705
Ah!

08:35.773 --> 08:37.773
That squirrel was Fred?

08:37.841 --> 08:40.174
Why would you make a
phony red squirrel?

08:40.243 --> 08:40.976
Why?

08:41.178 --> 08:43.144
Because special agent Buck Rotgut

08:43.212 --> 08:45.289
is completely mental.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.747
Your lies are burning my ear holes.

08:48.815 --> 08:51.427
He's thrown all our friends
into a detention cell.

08:51.494 --> 08:52.368
And for what?

08:52.435 --> 08:54.919
Because he thinks some
enemy from 47 years ago

08:54.987 --> 08:56.815
is still out there
plotting against him?

08:57.455 --> 08:59.289
Oh, I get it now.

08:59.357 --> 09:01.692
The red squirrel hates penguins.

09:01.759 --> 09:04.026
And you know who
else hates penguins?

09:04.094 --> 09:05.656
The red squirrel...

09:05.723 --> 09:06.896
The red squirrel!

09:07.965 --> 09:09.231
What? He's... he's...

09:09.299 --> 09:10.999
Okay, he's talking nonsense.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.333
I don't know, Private.

09:12.401 --> 09:14.555
You did get caught
red-squirrel-handed.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.337
A clever game, I'll give him that.

09:16.404 --> 09:19.639
Planting a decoy to cover up
your penguin plastic surgery.

09:19.707 --> 09:21.074
Nice move,

09:21.141 --> 09:22.474
red squirrel!

09:23.543 --> 09:25.276
Wait.

09:25.344 --> 09:27.578
You think Private
is the red squirrel?

09:27.645 --> 09:29.947
Uh, that's not really, uh...

09:30.015 --> 09:30.869
Possible.

09:30.936 --> 09:33.314
That sounds like squirrel talk.

09:33.381 --> 09:37.054
Maybe I got the right idea,
wrong penguin suit, huh?

09:37.122 --> 09:38.456
Who? Kowalski?

09:38.523 --> 09:40.590
He's been helping us
catch the red squirrel.

09:40.658 --> 09:42.425
Inside man.

09:42.493 --> 09:44.127
Your smarter than I thought, red.

09:44.195 --> 09:47.062
But I know how to make
you smart guys talk.

09:47.130 --> 09:50.832
You ever had a six-pound halibut
shoved up your left nostril?

09:50.900 --> 09:52.134
Not the left one, no.

09:52.964 --> 09:54.336
I did try to tell you.

09:54.403 --> 09:56.972
Rico, ring-a-ding special, asap.

09:58.976 --> 09:59.933
Yes.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.176
You don't say?

10:01.243 --> 10:02.176
Well, thanks, chief.

10:02.244 --> 10:03.434
That was HQ.

10:03.501 --> 10:06.314
They said you've been tracking
another decoy this whole time.

10:06.382 --> 10:08.183
The real red squirrel
is hiding out in

10:08.251 --> 10:11.853
Grr-furr-jiggle-stan.

10:11.921 --> 10:14.322
You tuna-fed thumb suckers
better sit this one out.

10:14.641 --> 10:18.557
Griffajigglestan is
no place for amateurs.

10:18.625 --> 10:21.046
I'm coming for you, squirrel.

10:21.113 --> 10:21.685
Clear.

10:27.231 --> 10:30.646
Well, maybe we left
our paranoia caps on

10:30.713 --> 10:32.399
A little too long.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.800
Oh, I do feel bad for the old guy.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.102
He's wasted decades
chasing an enemy

10:37.170 --> 10:38.970
that probably doesn't even exist.

10:44.505 --> 10:46.876
Red squirrel's log.

10:46.943 --> 10:50.945
Special agent Rotgut
has been disposed of.

10:51.262 --> 10:53.648
Time to get to work.

10:58.039 --> 10:59.723
Stupid eye patch.

10:59.724 --> 11:10.724
