WEBVTT

00:16.984 --> 00:18.417
Previously on APB...

00:18.470 --> 00:21.639
I will upgrade the 13th with
the best technology money can buy

00:21.664 --> 00:24.577
or I can build, 'cause, let's
be honest, that's the good stuff.

00:24.618 --> 00:26.015
We are here to drum up new business

00:26.040 --> 00:27.684
and increase revenue, period.

00:27.737 --> 00:28.935
Privatized policing.

00:28.976 --> 00:31.023
This could be a billion-dollar business.

00:31.048 --> 00:34.350
APB Prime... a revolutionary approach

00:34.375 --> 00:36.943
to privatized policing.

00:36.968 --> 00:38.176
Yeah, we're not doing any of that.

00:38.245 --> 00:40.846
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this one.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.226
Gideon out.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.804
_

00:48.734 --> 00:50.250
- Been a while.
- Danny...

00:50.275 --> 00:51.781
I go by DV8 now.

00:51.806 --> 00:54.320
- I need some help.
- What are you gonna do for me?

00:54.796 --> 00:56.185
I'll owe you a favor.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.498
- A favor.
- I need you to shut someone down.

00:58.523 --> 01:00.369
Bad guys. No one can know.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.671
All the way down... you just
have to dial a phone number.

01:32.018 --> 01:34.333
Yo, what gives?

01:34.401 --> 01:36.134
We never do runs out this far.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.587
It's a new deal.

01:37.612 --> 01:38.831
Benoit's orders.

01:39.815 --> 01:41.524
How come I wasn't told?

01:41.549 --> 01:42.892
I don't know.

01:42.917 --> 01:46.044
Maybe you were off in the
ladies' room or something.

02:01.939 --> 02:03.482
Jesse, this better be good.

02:03.507 --> 02:05.186
It's been, like, two
weeks since you called.

02:05.211 --> 02:06.310
Charlie, listen to me.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.974
I'm on a boat, and the guy I'm with

02:07.999 --> 02:09.935
just went down to the
hold, so I can't talk long.

02:10.003 --> 02:11.937
But I'm telling you, I
think they're gonna kill me.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.872
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow
down. Tell me where you are.

02:13.941 --> 02:16.021
The boat I'm on is
called The Wild Goose.

02:16.046 --> 02:18.530
We're supposed to be slinging
oxy for Benoit, but...

02:18.866 --> 02:20.974
I think it's a hit on me.

02:20.999 --> 02:22.196
Is Benoit there now?

02:22.221 --> 02:23.888
You're not hearing me, Charlie.

02:23.957 --> 02:26.724
I think that they know that
I'm working for the FBI.

02:26.793 --> 02:28.279
Jesse, listen to me, okay?

02:28.304 --> 02:31.273
I'm coming to help.
Just get someplace safe.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.452
Jesse? Jesse.

02:33.477 --> 02:34.966
Bon voyage, Jesse.

02:35.001 --> 02:36.640
Jesse!

02:39.718 --> 02:40.972
Jesse.

02:42.128 --> 02:43.193
Jesse!

02:47.533 --> 02:48.999
Hey, Mom, I have a question.

02:49.024 --> 02:50.982
Finish your tostada, you're
gonna be late to school.

02:51.007 --> 02:52.173
Busy day ahead?

02:52.198 --> 02:53.317
Is there any other kind?

02:53.386 --> 02:55.019
Be nice if you had some help.

02:55.088 --> 02:57.521
The handsome, successful,
good-with-kids kind.

02:57.590 --> 02:58.987
Really, Mom?

02:59.188 --> 03:02.033
I'm not asking my boss out, period.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.676
What was your question?

03:03.701 --> 03:05.835
What are the birds and the bees?

03:09.159 --> 03:10.301
Where did you hear that?

03:10.370 --> 03:12.870
Brian O'Hara. He says
his father told him.

03:12.895 --> 03:14.384
Well, Brian O'Hara needs to keep

03:14.409 --> 03:16.407
his family conversations to himself.

03:16.476 --> 03:18.175
It's not about animals, is it?

03:18.244 --> 03:19.777
You should ask your father.

03:19.846 --> 03:22.380
- Mami!
- ¿Qué? That's his department.

03:22.448 --> 03:24.982
I would, but he's always working.

03:27.587 --> 03:30.106
I'll tell you what. I
think it's a great question.

03:30.131 --> 03:31.653
And I promise that I'll answer it later,

03:31.678 --> 03:33.209
but please, for right now,
just go get ready for school.

03:33.234 --> 03:34.264
Okay.

03:34.289 --> 03:35.803
_

03:35.920 --> 03:38.576
Mami, por favor. I mean, really.

03:50.389 --> 03:51.850
Charlie.

03:52.578 --> 03:54.161
What are you doing here?

03:54.186 --> 03:55.579
I-I should have called first.

03:55.648 --> 03:57.818
And I'm sorry, but, Murphy,

03:57.843 --> 03:59.474
I need your help.

04:11.571 --> 04:13.841
What?! Damn it!

04:13.866 --> 04:15.615
Got to be fast around here.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.411
Better not be the jelly.

04:20.130 --> 04:21.716
It's not the jelly.

04:21.911 --> 04:23.107
Come on!

04:23.176 --> 04:25.476
We're gonna bounce back.

04:25.511 --> 04:27.178
What's that about?

04:27.203 --> 04:28.405
I am the future of Reeves Industries.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.781
Nothing. Just Gideon losing his company.

04:30.850 --> 04:32.316
Why is it on every channel?

04:32.385 --> 04:35.365
Why is it on every channel?!

04:35.459 --> 04:38.122
The future of Reeves
Industries hangs in the balance

04:38.191 --> 04:41.045
as founder and CEO Gideon Reeves failed

04:41.070 --> 04:43.771
to garner shareholder
support this past week.

04:43.796 --> 04:45.506
- You believe this crap?
- Yeah, I mean,

04:45.531 --> 04:46.964
- you want my honest answer, or...?
- No.

04:47.033 --> 04:48.850
According to reliable
sources, a takeover bid

04:48.875 --> 04:50.512
is reportedly being considered

04:50.537 --> 04:52.146
by the company's board of directors.

04:52.171 --> 04:53.600
Unbelievable.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.520
- I mean, it's a little...
- Ada!

04:55.545 --> 04:57.623
Reports indicate that
the closed-door dealings

04:57.648 --> 04:59.865
were organized by none other than...

04:59.890 --> 05:02.569
Reeves Industries' longtime
board chairperson...

05:02.594 --> 05:04.139
Lauren Fitch.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.809
I...

05:11.834 --> 05:13.631
cannot...

05:13.656 --> 05:14.951
believe...

05:14.976 --> 05:17.739
that lying, two-faced...

05:17.764 --> 05:19.748
excuse for a...

05:19.773 --> 05:21.521
You've reached the voice
mail of Lauren Fitch.

05:21.546 --> 05:22.576
Leave a message.

05:22.601 --> 05:24.418
If you think for one second

05:24.443 --> 05:25.870
I'm gonna sit back while you try to

05:25.938 --> 05:29.545
Winklevoss my Zuckerberg,
you are sorely mistaken.

05:29.584 --> 05:30.811
Could you explain to me...

05:30.836 --> 05:32.991
how, somewhere between the
boardroom and the bedroom,

05:33.016 --> 05:35.022
you somehow forgot to mention

05:35.047 --> 05:36.912
that you were arranging
to steal my company out

05:36.937 --> 05:38.279
from underneath me?

05:38.304 --> 05:40.201
- Gideon, I need you.
- I'm kind of in the middle of leaving

05:40.226 --> 05:41.928
a nasty voice message, Murphy.

05:41.953 --> 05:43.787
Lauren screwed him over.

05:43.823 --> 05:45.436
Shocker.

05:45.563 --> 05:47.363
Right. Um, this can't wait.

05:48.068 --> 05:50.467
Ju... call me back, damn it!

05:50.492 --> 05:53.597
Sorry. Just distracted
by watching my life's work

05:53.666 --> 05:55.662
and $120 billion go up in smoke.

05:55.687 --> 05:57.501
I know you have a lot going on, but...

05:57.570 --> 06:00.237
if there was ever a time
that I needed a favor,

06:00.306 --> 06:01.568
this is it.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.643
Oh, God.

06:05.711 --> 06:07.478
All right, all right,
you got my attention.

06:07.513 --> 06:08.879
But why are we outside?

06:08.948 --> 06:11.412
It's a sensitive conversation.

06:11.717 --> 06:14.351
Gideon Reeves, this is
Special Agent Charlie Vaughn

06:14.376 --> 06:15.546
with the FBI.

06:15.571 --> 06:16.865
It's a pleasure to meet you.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.989
Charlie here used to
work in the 13 district.

06:19.058 --> 06:21.959
Feels like another life, but,
yeah, it's a special place.

06:22.028 --> 06:23.411
It's good to see you
taking good care of it.

06:23.436 --> 06:25.129
Well, I don't know how much longer

06:25.198 --> 06:26.715
I'm gonna be taking care of anything.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.866
But as long as I am,
how-how can I help you?

06:28.891 --> 06:32.506
Well, I have this informant
on a case I've been working on.

06:32.531 --> 06:34.037
Kid's name is Jesse.

06:34.062 --> 06:36.062
Really been risking
his neck to help me out,

06:36.087 --> 06:38.303
then yesterday he went missing.

06:38.328 --> 06:40.298
Okay, what's the case?

06:40.399 --> 06:41.951
Louis Benoit.

06:42.896 --> 06:46.283
Refreshingly cosmopolitan
name for a criminal.

06:46.352 --> 06:48.953
Is he a chef or
impressionist painter or...

06:49.021 --> 06:51.701
Actually, one of the biggest
drug dealers in Chicago.

06:51.732 --> 06:53.324
Pills mostly. Oxy.

06:53.359 --> 06:55.457
He smuggles them from
Canada across Lake Michigan.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.646
And we've been building a case
against this guy for a year.

06:57.671 --> 06:59.563
Jesse's testimony was
gonna put him away,

06:59.632 --> 07:02.858
but yesterday Jesse calls me
from one of Benoit's boats,

07:02.883 --> 07:04.291
and he sounded scared.

07:04.326 --> 07:06.136
I'm worried he's at
the bottom of the lake.

07:06.172 --> 07:07.438
What makes you say that?

07:07.506 --> 07:09.770
Local fisherman spotted a fire
on the water six miles out,

07:09.795 --> 07:12.239
and the boat Jesse was on... missing.

07:12.264 --> 07:14.670
I go by his house, I check
his hangouts, nothing.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.314
Well, I'm still fairly new to policing,

07:17.383 --> 07:20.284
but that-that sounds
bad for your informant.

07:20.353 --> 07:22.215
That's why I need your help, Mr. Reeves.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.232
I need a way to process a crime scene...

07:25.303 --> 07:27.491
500 feet below the surface.

07:27.544 --> 07:29.592
Now, Murphy tells me you're
doing amazing things here.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.584
- Well...
- I figured you might have a way.

07:32.709 --> 07:34.198
Agent Vaughn, I'm sorry.

07:34.290 --> 07:37.404
I-I-I wish that I
could help, but it's...

07:38.428 --> 07:40.264
kind of a bad time right now.

07:40.289 --> 07:42.489
Jesse risked his neck for me.

07:42.514 --> 07:43.807
He was trying to get out of
the life. He trusted me...

07:43.876 --> 07:45.201
I owe him justice, at least.

07:45.226 --> 07:46.644
Why District 13, Agent Vaughn?

07:46.712 --> 07:48.553
Why not just go to the FBI?

07:48.578 --> 07:50.814
You realize Lake Michigan
is ice-nine levels

07:50.883 --> 07:52.216
of freezing this time of year?

07:52.285 --> 07:54.475
Which is why the marine unit
won't send in the divers.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.786
But we can't wait.

07:55.855 --> 07:57.721
If I'm gonna get anything
out of this crime scene,

07:57.790 --> 07:59.551
anything I can use against Benoit,

07:59.576 --> 08:01.125
I got to get it now.

08:01.467 --> 08:04.128
Now, Murphy tells me you've got
better toys than the Bureau has,

08:04.196 --> 08:05.629
and that you can do the impossible.

08:05.698 --> 08:08.365
And that is exactly
what I need right now.

08:10.603 --> 08:11.943
Ah...

08:19.612 --> 08:22.946
Ada, I need you to get something
from Reeves Industries for me.

08:25.037 --> 08:27.117
Wait for it, wait for it.

08:27.764 --> 08:29.086
Huh?

08:29.155 --> 08:31.748
- What is that?
- That is awesome.

08:31.773 --> 08:35.215
It is a deep-space submersible,

08:35.240 --> 08:37.394
designed to explore Europa.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.083
- What's Europa?
- That's one of Jupiter's moons.

08:40.109 --> 08:44.318
It's covered in frozen lakes, and
NASA contracted us to build it,

08:44.740 --> 08:47.826
in hopes of finding signs
of life beneath the ice.

08:47.851 --> 08:49.936
And they are not that
happy that I borrowed it.

08:49.961 --> 08:51.608
Well, I will bring it back.

08:51.677 --> 08:53.944
It cost $50 million.

08:54.207 --> 08:56.482
I'll make sure not to scratch it.

08:59.428 --> 09:01.918
Space submarines, NASA?

09:01.943 --> 09:04.388
You weren't kidding about this guy.

09:04.457 --> 09:06.771
When he's in, he's-he's all in.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.684
Agent Vaughn, I could use a hand
getting this baby in the water.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.357
You got it. I'll be back.

09:12.592 --> 09:13.825
Thank you.

09:13.850 --> 09:16.075
Well, there are safety hooks
on each side of the sub.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.135
They need to be turned
simultaneously in order to...

09:18.219 --> 09:20.020
Charlie seems like a nice guy.

09:20.045 --> 09:22.475
Yeah, he was always
that kind of cop that...

09:22.592 --> 09:24.061
just never stopped caring.

09:24.086 --> 09:27.068
Oh, well, you have
that in common, right?

09:27.587 --> 09:29.020
I think I see it.

09:30.216 --> 09:31.529
Anything else?

09:31.740 --> 09:33.417
What, what? I'm just...

09:33.486 --> 09:34.852
I'm just wondering if there's something,

09:34.920 --> 09:37.354
I don't know, special
about Special Agent Vaughn.

09:37.423 --> 09:38.589
I'm not having this conversation.

09:38.624 --> 09:40.537
I knew it. I was right.

09:46.556 --> 09:47.795
So...

09:47.820 --> 09:49.607
so, what, you guys date, or...

09:54.120 --> 09:56.756
Charlie was the reason
my marriage broke up.

09:58.326 --> 09:59.584
Right.

09:59.648 --> 10:02.334
Well, that's another kind of dating.

10:02.678 --> 10:05.209
Scott and I weren't in a good place.

10:05.551 --> 10:08.115
Charlie and I were friends, and we...

10:08.140 --> 10:09.539
we made a mistake.

10:09.684 --> 10:12.018
Only it made a bad situation worse.

10:12.158 --> 10:14.491
Right. You two still...

10:14.560 --> 10:16.021
No. Any more questions, Geraldo?

10:16.046 --> 10:17.334
- None whatsoever.
- Okay.

10:17.359 --> 10:19.092
Okay. I'll just...

10:22.092 --> 10:23.200
Hello.

10:23.269 --> 10:25.502
Hi, Ada. Did you miss me?

10:28.310 --> 10:31.271
Yeah, um, I can't really talk right now.

10:31.318 --> 10:32.843
Don't worry, I'll be quick.

10:32.912 --> 10:34.928
I'm calling in that favor you owe me.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.501
Okay, so what do you want?

10:36.526 --> 10:38.125
We'll discuss it in person.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.631
Meet me at the Clark
Street Bridge, noon.

10:41.592 --> 10:43.520
Yeah, I can't, um...

10:43.581 --> 10:45.014
I can't really meet
you right now, 'cause...

10:45.057 --> 10:47.404
You can. And you will.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.132
Otherwise, I'm telling
everyone exactly what you did

10:50.157 --> 10:52.006
when you had a man killed.

11:02.123 --> 11:05.309
Comms are up, and all
instruments are calibrated.

11:05.334 --> 11:08.685
Cool. Let's get that R.O.V. wet, Pete.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.484
Anchors aweigh, Gideon.

11:13.516 --> 11:15.006
She's a go.

11:17.756 --> 11:20.113
We used historical current data

11:20.138 --> 11:22.272
to create a model with the lake floor

11:22.297 --> 11:24.816
at a depth of 279 feet

11:24.841 --> 11:26.816
and then generated a surface area map,

11:26.841 --> 11:30.176
giving us a search
diameter of 20 square miles.

11:38.818 --> 11:40.744
Gideon, we've been at this for hours

11:40.813 --> 11:43.271
with nothing to show
for it but plankton.

11:43.427 --> 11:45.278
Okay, let's keep an eye out.

11:45.303 --> 11:46.545
Kind of hard.

11:46.570 --> 11:49.045
Not much light 300
feet below the surface.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.773
How long has he been at this?

11:50.842 --> 11:52.263
Too long.

11:57.788 --> 11:59.381
There!

12:05.027 --> 12:06.691
The Wild Goose?

12:06.889 --> 12:08.091
What happened to it?

12:08.116 --> 12:10.381
Well, about to find out.

12:18.474 --> 12:19.857
I don't see Jesse.

12:19.882 --> 12:20.888
Can you check out the cabin?

12:20.913 --> 12:22.946
No, there's too much
damage from the fire,

12:23.024 --> 12:25.491
and the sub's too big to
fit through the doorway.

12:25.516 --> 12:27.451
Great. Now what?

12:27.490 --> 12:30.301
Please. This baby's
designed to bust through

12:30.326 --> 12:33.286
62 miles of moon ice.

12:33.311 --> 12:34.744
Watch this.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.492
Leaving the stern...

12:37.517 --> 12:41.209
and coming around to the starboard side.

13:02.798 --> 13:03.940
Nice.

13:04.008 --> 13:05.775
Big Bad Wolf's got nothing on me.

13:13.973 --> 13:15.274
Oh!

13:17.789 --> 13:19.157
Sorry, Agent Vaughn,

13:19.182 --> 13:22.163
but it looks like your informant is, uh,

13:22.188 --> 13:23.899
done informing.

13:24.353 --> 13:25.509
No.

13:26.034 --> 13:27.626
That's not Jesse.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.367
What? Then who is that?

13:31.436 --> 13:32.774
That's Pascal.

13:32.799 --> 13:33.947
It's one of Benoit's hit men.

13:33.972 --> 13:35.805
He's probably there to
take Jesse out and...

13:35.840 --> 13:37.773
looks like he turned the tables on him.

13:37.798 --> 13:40.103
- So he could still be alive.
- For now.

13:40.128 --> 13:41.919
If they're already
sending hit men after him,

13:41.944 --> 13:43.577
he's not gonna be
around for much longer.

13:54.507 --> 13:56.514
Listen, I appreciate the offer,

13:56.539 --> 13:58.123
but you guys have done enough.

13:58.148 --> 13:59.477
I've got to find Jesse.

13:59.502 --> 14:02.136
- Could the FBI give you more resources?
- They can.

14:02.205 --> 14:04.805
But any request I put in has
to be run up the flagpole,

14:04.874 --> 14:05.973
and it is a long flagpole.

14:06.042 --> 14:07.241
By the time that happens,

14:07.310 --> 14:09.794
Jesse will either be gone or dead.

14:09.819 --> 14:11.412
So let us help you.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.562
Look, Benoit dumps, what,

14:13.587 --> 14:15.922
$6 million in pills a year in this city?

14:15.947 --> 14:17.874
That makes it our case, too.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.186
Yeah, I don't know.

14:19.247 --> 14:21.180
I mean, I'd have to request paperwork

14:21.224 --> 14:23.162
for a, a joint task force.

14:23.187 --> 14:26.787
Yeah. Or, another option,
don't put in the paperwork.

14:26.812 --> 14:28.577
This might be an FBI case.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.136
It's also a crime in our district.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.761
There's no law against two agencies

14:32.801 --> 14:34.667
going after the same bad guy.

14:34.741 --> 14:35.974
He's got a point.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.952
Okay, but there is a risk.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.847
If this goes wrong, and the FBI
brass hears how it went down...

14:40.872 --> 14:42.061
Yeah.

14:42.086 --> 14:44.921
You want to know how I
built a $120 billion company?

14:45.114 --> 14:47.038
Now, I do apologize when necessary,

14:47.079 --> 14:48.780
but I don't ever ask permission.

14:49.265 --> 14:50.818
I can fix your problem

14:50.887 --> 14:52.853
and keep my mind off my own.

14:52.922 --> 14:54.422
Come on, Special Agent.

14:54.447 --> 14:55.880
Let's do this.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.505
Look who's here.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.921
You didn't leave me much of a choice.

15:06.946 --> 15:08.502
Well, I did some digging.

15:08.571 --> 15:10.715
It turns out that that was
a lot more than just a favor

15:10.740 --> 15:12.673
you asked me for a few weeks ago.

15:12.742 --> 15:14.296
That call I made?

15:14.624 --> 15:17.178
It was to a cell phone
attached to a bomb.

15:17.246 --> 15:19.347
A man died in the explosion.

15:19.749 --> 15:21.916
- And he was gonna kill three people.
- Maybe.

15:21.984 --> 15:23.491
But I'm pretty sure the Chicago police

15:23.516 --> 15:25.366
still kind of frown on murder.

15:26.889 --> 15:28.554
So what do you want, Danny?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.256
You've inspired me, Ada.

15:30.281 --> 15:33.146
I want to stop the bad
guys, just like you.

15:33.272 --> 15:36.733
And I want to start...
with Gideon Reeves.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.398
Gideon's not a criminal.

15:40.021 --> 15:42.313
He's really got you
brainwashed, hasn't he?

15:42.338 --> 15:44.238
What are you talking about?

15:44.557 --> 15:46.916
While you're worried about
losers stealing TV sets,

15:46.941 --> 15:49.742
your boss is creating a police
state right in front of you.

15:49.767 --> 15:50.878
- He's a fascist, Ada.
- Oh, my God.

15:50.947 --> 15:53.353
He's using technology to
steal our civil liberties.

15:53.378 --> 15:56.017
- That's not what it's like.
- That's exactly what it's like.

15:58.867 --> 16:00.002
"One believes things...

16:00.027 --> 16:01.627
"because one has been
conditioned to believe them."

16:01.652 --> 16:02.891
Remember that?

16:02.916 --> 16:05.892
It's from Brave New World, the book
you begged me to read in college.

16:05.917 --> 16:08.551
Way before Gideon was
pulling your strings.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.416
I'm reminding you of the
truth you used to know.

16:12.427 --> 16:15.172
Here. This is for you.

16:16.119 --> 16:18.339
- What is it?
- I call it a crowbar.

16:18.408 --> 16:19.874
Just plug it into the district servers,

16:19.942 --> 16:22.767
it'll pry open an encrypted
backdoor for me to do my thing.

16:22.846 --> 16:24.445
Your thing?

16:24.514 --> 16:26.799
It's called checks and balances.

16:26.824 --> 16:29.894
The wolf got himself put in
charge of protecting the sheep.

16:29.919 --> 16:32.953
And with this, I watch the wolf.

16:33.275 --> 16:35.549
- I'm not doing that.
- Oh, yes, you are.

16:35.574 --> 16:37.262
And you've got 24
hours to make it happen,

16:37.287 --> 16:39.227
otherwise every cop in this city...

16:39.252 --> 16:40.697
will know about the blood on your hands.

16:40.722 --> 16:43.140
Danny, please. You can't
undo all of this that we're...

16:43.165 --> 16:45.236
That's where you're wrong, Ada.

16:45.261 --> 16:46.667
Like the book says,

16:47.134 --> 16:49.432
"Ending is better than mending."

17:02.690 --> 17:04.022
What you got?

17:04.048 --> 17:06.319
I pulled up Jesse's last known address,

17:06.388 --> 17:08.843
all the stuff from Charlie's
confidential informant files,

17:08.867 --> 17:09.962
and I got us this.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.306
Look at you, data-mining like a
Reeves Industries professional.

17:13.330 --> 17:14.982
You mean Chicago detective.

17:15.007 --> 17:16.772
Well, if he's in the city,

17:16.798 --> 17:18.897
sending his face out on the APB app...

17:18.923 --> 17:21.190
I was thinking that, too, but that
could be very dangerous for Jesse.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.980
You saw that floating corpse, right?

17:23.005 --> 17:26.117
I think he wandered into
dangerous territory a while back.

17:26.143 --> 17:28.478
I know. But as bad as it
is, it could get worse.

17:28.502 --> 17:30.144
If we scare Jesse out of hiding,

17:30.213 --> 17:32.540
then Benoit's guys can get to him first.

17:33.593 --> 17:36.181
Unless we get Benoit off the street.

17:39.288 --> 17:40.859
And so, the guy says,

17:40.884 --> 17:42.981
"I worked in Chicago for 20 years.

17:43.016 --> 17:44.343
"I never had a problem with crime."

17:44.368 --> 17:46.594
And the lady goes,
"Well, what did you do?"

17:46.662 --> 17:49.497
And the guy says, "I was a hit man."

17:51.585 --> 17:53.140
Mr. Benoit?

17:54.476 --> 17:56.380
Have a seat.

17:58.531 --> 17:59.807
What the hell do you want?

17:59.842 --> 18:01.575
We've got a warrant for your arrest.

18:02.468 --> 18:03.944
Are you serious, coming in here?

18:03.969 --> 18:05.546
I'm a legitimate businessman.

18:08.356 --> 18:09.890
Can you stand, please?

18:16.325 --> 18:17.491
You're embarrassing me.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.260
I'm gonna sue your
whole damn department.

18:19.328 --> 18:21.194
You may want to sue the
FBI while you're at it.

18:21.219 --> 18:24.296
Oh, so you guys are Agent
Vaughn's bitches, huh?

18:24.702 --> 18:27.466
If I were you, I'd let
the lawyers do the talking.

18:27.491 --> 18:28.824
Let's go.

18:33.823 --> 18:35.356
Let's go.

18:38.181 --> 18:39.723
Enjoy your lunch, fellas.

18:44.629 --> 18:45.954
Anything, Ada?

18:45.979 --> 18:48.146
Yeah, we got some tips
after we uploaded his photo.

18:48.171 --> 18:49.937
A few of them place him downtown.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.326
What about these two, here?

18:52.351 --> 18:54.114
They say he was seen
driving away from that area.

18:54.139 --> 18:56.111
I mean, he can't be at
two places at one time.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.464
Yeah, I was thinking about that.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.442
It could just be noise,

18:59.498 --> 19:01.198
- or it could be...
- What?

19:01.237 --> 19:03.462
Yeah, you see? A tip
that says he's on the move

19:03.487 --> 19:04.935
came from the same account.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.660
Maybe Jesse's trying to
throw us off the trail.

19:06.685 --> 19:08.542
So you think that's Jesse's account?

19:08.611 --> 19:10.204
I mean, it'd be a good bet.

19:10.229 --> 19:12.623
And we get their GPS info
for emergency services, so...

19:12.648 --> 19:13.751
You can get his location?

19:13.797 --> 19:16.331
We can get his exact
location, to be exact.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.767
That's redundant. I don't know...

19:17.792 --> 19:19.650
I'm gonna head that way. Keep me posted.

19:22.916 --> 19:24.249
This is Agent Vaughn.

19:24.318 --> 19:25.611
Charlie.

19:25.636 --> 19:27.636
- Get in the car, we found him.
- Okay.

19:39.752 --> 19:41.470
Gideon, I'm coming in hot.

19:41.495 --> 19:43.501
But you got to tell me where I'm going.

19:44.502 --> 19:47.508
Okay, okay. Hold onto
your paddle shifters.

19:47.533 --> 19:48.699
Murphy, got him.

19:48.767 --> 19:50.282
He's in Millennium Park.

19:50.307 --> 19:52.056
- I'm on my way.
- Okay, hurry.

19:52.081 --> 19:53.381
He's stopped now.

19:53.406 --> 19:55.015
I don't know how much
longer he's gonna stay put.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.337
Copy that.

20:17.478 --> 20:18.861
Okay.

20:19.131 --> 20:20.736
What is this thing?

20:26.236 --> 20:27.498
Ada.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.619
I was wondering where you were.

20:29.644 --> 20:31.348
Yeah, I was doing a thing.

20:31.373 --> 20:33.295
Well, I don't mean to interrupt, but...

20:33.320 --> 20:34.810
I got something for you.

20:34.879 --> 20:37.295
Jelly doughnuts.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.587
A whole dozen, just for you.

20:39.612 --> 20:40.677
I felt bad.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.118
Well, you didn't have to do that.

20:42.187 --> 20:43.584
No, no, I wanted to.

20:43.609 --> 20:44.954
It's the least I could do.

20:45.023 --> 20:46.514
You do a lot around here.

20:46.539 --> 20:49.073
And I want you to
know, it's appreciated.

20:49.818 --> 20:52.623
Thank you. That's really nice.

20:53.266 --> 20:55.490
Yeah, well...

21:16.099 --> 21:17.309
_

21:17.388 --> 21:18.676
What's up, Ada?

21:18.701 --> 21:20.012
Hey, Goss. I just got a call

21:20.037 --> 21:21.257
that I need you and Brandt to check out.

21:21.326 --> 21:23.004
- What's that?
- It's a hacker.

21:23.029 --> 21:24.251
Goes by the name "DV8."

21:24.295 --> 21:26.793
I'm sending a picture to
your cruiser right now.

21:27.543 --> 21:29.277
- What do we know about him?
- Not much.

21:29.302 --> 21:30.371
Just got an anonymous tip

21:30.396 --> 21:32.309
he's up to some seriously bad stuff.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.933
He lives across town from your location.

21:33.958 --> 21:35.934
It's a drive, but I'll owe you one.

21:36.199 --> 21:37.632
Sounds interesting.

21:38.942 --> 21:41.292
All right, we'll check
it out. We're on it.

21:53.009 --> 21:54.585
You people work fast.

21:54.610 --> 21:56.454
I don't want to inflate his ego,
'cause I know he's listening,

21:56.479 --> 21:58.245
but that's the wonders of
working with Gideon Reeves.

21:58.270 --> 22:00.062
Flattery will get you everywhere.

22:00.131 --> 22:03.149
All right, he's moving
again. Go south, go south.

22:04.902 --> 22:08.063
Uh-oh, Captain Conrad's
speaking in hushed tones

22:08.088 --> 22:10.817
with a gray-haired man
in an expensive suit

22:10.842 --> 22:13.727
and a murse over his shoulder.

22:13.752 --> 22:15.785
That doesn't look good.

22:20.986 --> 22:23.306
Is that guy selling
subscriptions, or...?

22:23.331 --> 22:25.470
That was Benoit's high-priced lawyer.

22:25.495 --> 22:26.794
He wants his client out.

22:26.819 --> 22:29.125
I told him we'd get on
the paperwork, but...

22:29.150 --> 22:31.048
I can only type so slow.

22:31.073 --> 22:34.322
So whatever you're doing,
better do it faster.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.267
You hear that, Murphy?

22:39.292 --> 22:40.703
Copy. Still looking.

22:57.883 --> 23:00.563
You know, it's not exactly
easy to pick out one guy

23:00.588 --> 23:01.854
in a sea of tourists,

23:01.879 --> 23:04.536
especially when you're blinded by
the world's largest shiny object.

23:04.561 --> 23:06.087
No eyes on him yet.

23:24.754 --> 23:28.946
Well, if it's any consolation,
it is a pretty cool view.

23:34.549 --> 23:35.611
Any luck?

23:35.636 --> 23:37.126
Eh, nothing over there.

23:37.195 --> 23:39.495
Be prepared; if he
sees us, he's gonna run.

23:39.564 --> 23:41.764
- Doesn't he trust you?
- Well, he did.

23:41.817 --> 23:43.034
But I promised him protection.

23:43.075 --> 23:45.753
Given the circumstances,
I wouldn't trust me either.

23:46.769 --> 23:48.304
Gideon, he's not here.

23:48.329 --> 23:50.081
GPS says he is.

23:50.106 --> 23:51.440
I'm looking at him right now.

23:51.465 --> 23:52.503
I don't know what to tell you.

23:52.528 --> 23:54.995
Murphy, he is right on top of you.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.841
No, we're on top of him.

24:19.904 --> 24:21.231
Jesse!

24:24.766 --> 24:26.509
Jesse! Jesse.

24:26.534 --> 24:29.457
Stop, we're trying to help you.

24:30.926 --> 24:33.324
Agent Vaughn did say he might run.

24:33.432 --> 24:35.410
Yeah, I can see that.

24:41.456 --> 24:43.129
C-come on, come on.

24:45.429 --> 24:46.995
You think she ever gets tired?

24:47.020 --> 24:48.801
I once saw that woman chase a suspect

24:48.826 --> 24:50.993
94 floors down the Hancock Tower,

24:51.018 --> 24:52.601
without breaking a damn sweat.

24:52.626 --> 24:55.026
This poor kid doesn't stand a chance.

25:03.273 --> 25:04.675
Hey, watch where you're going!

25:06.175 --> 25:07.981
- Get off of me!
- Oh!

25:08.006 --> 25:10.185
What did I tell you? She got him.

25:10.210 --> 25:11.863
- Stop fighting.
- Get off of me!

25:11.888 --> 25:13.788
We're trying to save your life.

25:13.935 --> 25:16.201
Hail Murphy, full of badass.

25:23.053 --> 25:26.354
Jesse, you know I can help you.

25:26.379 --> 25:27.580
I heard that before.

25:27.605 --> 25:29.813
Right before Benoit tried to whack me.

25:30.151 --> 25:31.704
I don't know who to trust.

25:33.911 --> 25:36.501
Why don't you just tell us
what happened on the boat?

25:37.993 --> 25:39.634
I got a call.

25:39.863 --> 25:43.118
We were on a run, but
something was weird.

25:43.143 --> 25:45.352
Pascal, he wasn't himself.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.966
That's when I called you guys.

25:47.035 --> 25:49.266
- You killed him.
- I-I didn't have a choice.

25:49.303 --> 25:51.137
He fired at me a couple
times. He hit a fuel line.

25:51.162 --> 25:53.062
By the time I managed to
wrestle the gun out of his hands,

25:53.087 --> 25:54.987
the whole boat was in flames.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.953
They don't call it a life
raft for nothing, you know.

25:56.978 --> 25:59.245
Look, I'm really sorry, man,
but without your testimony,

25:59.314 --> 26:00.580
Benoit's gonna walk.

26:00.649 --> 26:02.688
You'll be looking over your
shoulder for the rest of your life.

26:02.713 --> 26:03.772
Better than no life at all.

26:03.797 --> 26:04.938
- Jesse...
- Yeah.

26:08.563 --> 26:10.330
Look, man, you don't know me.

26:10.355 --> 26:12.368
I know you tackle like Dick Butkus.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.139
I've known Charlie for a long time.

26:15.163 --> 26:17.571
I've trusted him with my
life more than once, and look,

26:17.596 --> 26:18.944
I'm still here.

26:18.969 --> 26:20.689
Trusting him?

26:20.884 --> 26:22.532
That's your only play.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.532
You can't be sure of that.

26:24.557 --> 26:26.190
I can be sure of this,

26:26.215 --> 26:29.548
if we can find you, so can Benoit.

26:32.281 --> 26:33.876
She's a better talker than you.

26:34.082 --> 26:36.215
Believe me, I know.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.439
You better protect my ass.

26:39.464 --> 26:42.065
I got a FBI safe house
just outside the city.

26:42.090 --> 26:43.323
That right?

26:44.042 --> 26:45.441
They got cable?

26:46.236 --> 26:47.775
Come on, I'll follow you there.

26:49.025 --> 26:52.173
So now she's taking him
to an FBI safe house.

26:52.198 --> 26:53.598
I knew she would.

26:53.623 --> 26:55.790
Yeah, well, you know everything
that goes on around here, right?

26:57.005 --> 26:58.771
I keep my eyes and ears open.

26:58.807 --> 27:02.875
Right. So what's the story
with Murphy and this guy?

27:02.944 --> 27:05.454
No, you won't hear it from me.

27:05.479 --> 27:07.110
Cops don't talk.

27:07.782 --> 27:09.773
I do have a question for you, though.

27:09.798 --> 27:12.952
I watch the news, and I'm aware of
what's going on with your company.

27:12.987 --> 27:14.620
I have to ask,

27:14.656 --> 27:16.704
is District 13 gonna lose you?

27:16.729 --> 27:18.040
Hmm.

27:19.243 --> 27:20.960
Billionaires don't talk, either.

27:22.915 --> 27:25.150
But you might want to take cover.

27:26.267 --> 27:27.800
Ah.

27:27.836 --> 27:29.056
Hi.

27:33.439 --> 27:34.656
Hello, Lauren.

27:34.681 --> 27:36.970
Or should I call you Judas?

27:37.165 --> 27:38.587
You got some nerve coming here.

27:38.612 --> 27:42.792
You just stole a $50 million
submersible from my company.

27:42.817 --> 27:44.306
Your company?

27:44.331 --> 27:47.532
Your little takeover bid
still has a long way to go.

27:47.557 --> 27:51.314
Till the lawyers sign the
papers, that's my company.

27:52.026 --> 27:53.853
Don't get too comfortable.

27:53.878 --> 27:55.579
The board is voting to suspend you.

27:55.604 --> 27:57.170
Oh, God.

27:57.195 --> 27:58.267
I'll talk to them.

27:58.292 --> 28:00.212
Oh, they heard enough at
the shareholders' meeting.

28:00.237 --> 28:01.403
"Gideon out"?

28:01.428 --> 28:02.661
That...

28:02.686 --> 28:04.052
I was trying to send a message.

28:04.106 --> 28:06.138
Okay, well, now they're
sending you a message.

28:06.163 --> 28:08.351
For the past few months
you have neglected everyone

28:08.376 --> 28:09.931
and everything at Reeves Industries

28:09.956 --> 28:13.179
so that you can play cops and
robots here at District 13.

28:13.248 --> 28:15.416
We have all had enough.

28:16.217 --> 28:18.900
So when I really need
you to have my back,

28:18.925 --> 28:20.674
you stick a knife in it?

28:20.939 --> 28:22.755
If you remain at the helm,

28:22.824 --> 28:24.697
your company will fail.

28:24.932 --> 28:27.794
Those billions of dollars
that you love to spend?

28:27.819 --> 28:29.110
They go away, Gideon.

28:29.135 --> 28:31.158
You think that this is about the money?

28:31.183 --> 28:33.350
It's always been about the money.

28:35.101 --> 28:37.535
Maybe once, a long time ago,

28:37.681 --> 28:39.744
it was about something a lot more.

28:44.131 --> 28:45.664
Now I know better.

28:56.118 --> 28:57.569
Chicago Police!

29:00.759 --> 29:02.194
Clear!

29:02.730 --> 29:04.366
Bedroom's empty.

29:05.804 --> 29:07.233
You're not gonna need that.

29:07.302 --> 29:10.349
You don't know that,
DV8's a cyber terrorist.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.616
Translation: he's a nerd
armed with nachos and soda.

29:13.641 --> 29:15.341
They tend to avoid bathing

29:15.368 --> 29:17.328
and cry when the cuffs are slapped on.

29:17.353 --> 29:19.163
This will be a walk in the park.

29:23.780 --> 29:25.952
Well, I guess he deviated.

29:31.597 --> 29:34.225
Or he's watching us right now.

29:42.469 --> 29:44.343
_

29:48.476 --> 29:49.509
Whoa.

29:49.577 --> 29:51.210
This ain't nachos and soda. What the...?

29:51.279 --> 29:52.747
It's a burn switch.

29:52.772 --> 29:54.569
- He's torching the gear!
- Should we grab it?

29:54.594 --> 29:56.202
No! We call the fire department

29:56.227 --> 29:58.108
and get the hell out of here!

29:59.991 --> 30:01.263
Squad. 1309,

30:01.288 --> 30:02.929
escorting Agent Vaughn and witness

30:02.954 --> 30:04.272
to the FBI safe house.

30:04.297 --> 30:05.624
Copy that, 1309.

30:05.649 --> 30:08.825
Hurry back, I'm not
paying for special time

30:08.850 --> 30:11.077
with Special Agent Vaughn.

30:11.444 --> 30:12.532
All right, Gideon.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.327
1309, out.

30:20.663 --> 30:22.271
_

30:22.343 --> 30:23.929
- Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah, Murph?

30:23.954 --> 30:25.358
How's the passenger?

30:28.210 --> 30:29.615
Yeah, he's out.

30:29.684 --> 30:31.561
Probably hasn't slept in a few days.

30:31.586 --> 30:33.796
You know, I know what it's
like losing an informant.

30:33.821 --> 30:36.355
You hadn't come to us for
help, he would've been dead.

30:36.380 --> 30:37.513
He's lucky to have you.

30:37.538 --> 30:39.071
Eh, it's more like he's lucky

30:39.096 --> 30:41.604
you had an outer space
submarine on hand.

30:41.629 --> 30:43.350
And I got to say that your new boss

30:43.375 --> 30:45.443
seems like one hell
of a guy to work for.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.241
Thank God we're on a
private comm channel,

30:47.266 --> 30:48.913
and he didn't hear that.

30:49.327 --> 30:51.304
Huh. Well, in that case,

30:51.372 --> 30:52.572
want to hear a joke?

30:52.607 --> 30:54.983
No, you tell terrible jokes.

30:55.008 --> 30:57.142
A grasshopper walks into a bar.

30:57.167 --> 30:58.413
I said no.

30:58.438 --> 31:00.490
Bartender says, "You're a grasshopper,

31:00.515 --> 31:02.048
"we make a drink named after you."

31:02.073 --> 31:04.574
Grasshopper says, "You
make a drink named Phil?"

31:06.649 --> 31:08.749
That's terrible, please, no more.

31:12.317 --> 31:13.975
We've got company.

31:17.287 --> 31:18.780
Look alive.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.970
No, I think we're good.

31:23.995 --> 31:25.409
They're just passing.

31:25.653 --> 31:27.520
And we're almost there anyway.

31:41.827 --> 31:44.156
1309. 10-1, shots fired!

31:45.767 --> 31:47.608
- Murphy?
- 1309. Shots fired!

31:47.633 --> 31:49.077
Murphy, what's going on?

31:49.102 --> 31:51.179
We're under attack! It's Benoit's men!

32:21.208 --> 32:22.474
Jesse's hit!

32:22.499 --> 32:23.598
Jesse's hit!

32:23.623 --> 32:25.364
We've got to get 'em some backup.

32:25.537 --> 32:27.646
Ada, you heard the nice captain.

32:27.671 --> 32:29.871
I need all units to... what...

32:29.896 --> 32:31.091
what's Murphy's location?

32:31.116 --> 32:32.583
She's 30 minutes outside of the city.

32:32.608 --> 32:33.732
What's she doing all the way out there?

32:33.757 --> 32:35.412
I don't care. Call the local cops.

32:35.437 --> 32:37.144
Get everyone there now!

32:38.663 --> 32:39.762
Charlie!

32:39.831 --> 32:41.255
- Yeah!
- Behind you!

32:41.280 --> 32:43.083
I'll cover you. Go!

32:48.433 --> 32:49.966
Go, go, go, go, go.

33:10.171 --> 33:12.271
I called for backup.
We just need to wait.

33:12.860 --> 33:15.407
- How is he?
- Yeah, he's bleeding, but he's fine.

33:20.470 --> 33:22.149
Go, Vaughn, go!

33:29.673 --> 33:31.954
God Almighty, they're under heavy fire.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.087
Help me get them out of it, Ada.

33:35.112 --> 33:36.671
Okay, local PD says
they're sending people,

33:36.696 --> 33:38.092
but they're gonna be a while.

33:40.892 --> 33:42.798
- What do you need?
- Pete.

33:42.823 --> 33:45.134
I need you to get a drone
to Murphy in Melrose Park.

33:45.159 --> 33:46.280
How long?

33:46.305 --> 33:48.727
Hmm, top speed, at least 20 minutes.

33:50.718 --> 33:52.454
They'll be dead in ten.

33:54.707 --> 33:55.973
I'm gonna make it, right?

33:55.998 --> 33:57.977
It's a clean shot, through and
through. You're gonna be fine.

34:01.493 --> 34:02.825
We got to get Jesse to a hospital

34:02.850 --> 34:04.147
or he's gonna bleed out.

34:04.182 --> 34:05.315
Okay, they got us outgunned

34:05.383 --> 34:07.216
and our ammo's not gonna last forever.

34:07.285 --> 34:09.141
If they charge us, we're dead.

34:09.166 --> 34:10.759
- Gideon will come for us.
- Yeah?

34:10.822 --> 34:12.188
And what if he doesn't?

34:13.618 --> 34:15.650
They're not gonna let us
walk out of here alive.

34:17.292 --> 34:18.696
Theresa.

34:19.431 --> 34:21.976
There's something I need
to say to you about us.

34:22.002 --> 34:23.900
Charlie, this is not the time for that.

34:23.969 --> 34:25.768
Might be all the time we have,

34:25.837 --> 34:27.704
and I need you to hear it.

34:27.728 --> 34:29.524
Theresa, there's not a day goes by...

34:29.549 --> 34:31.243
that I don't think about you,

34:31.907 --> 34:34.476
wondering if things could be different,

34:34.545 --> 34:36.415
if we could try again.

34:36.446 --> 34:39.710
Charlie, what happened
between us was a long time ago.

34:39.735 --> 34:42.318
I'm not apologizing for it
and you shouldn't either.

34:42.342 --> 34:43.609
But it should stay in the past.

34:55.998 --> 34:57.164
Damn it.

34:58.647 --> 35:00.069
I should've grabbed the
shotgun from the car.

35:00.138 --> 35:02.327
Doesn't matter now unless
it can drive itself in here.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.693
Oh, my God, that's it.

35:03.718 --> 35:05.618
Hey, hang on. I have an idea.

35:05.643 --> 35:07.420
Wait a minute. Have you been
listening the whole time?

35:08.580 --> 35:11.312
- What is it?
- Pete, did you install...

35:11.337 --> 35:13.226
the collision avoidance
systems in all the cruisers?

35:13.251 --> 35:14.812
- Yeah, I finished them last week.
- Uh-huh.

35:14.837 --> 35:17.288
And did you use a single channel
remote to activate the brakes?

35:17.313 --> 35:19.218
No. Multi, in case we
need to make an upgrade.

35:19.243 --> 35:20.687
Uh-huh, well, we're
gonna make an upgrade.

35:20.712 --> 35:21.858
Get down to the motor pool.

35:21.893 --> 35:23.429
I'm gonna connect to Murphy's cruiser.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.820
What are you gonna do?

35:24.845 --> 35:26.593
I'm gonna engineer a getaway car.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.793
I don't think this
is gonna work, Gideon.

35:30.818 --> 35:33.546
Okay, okay, I don't need
Pessimistic Pete right now.

35:33.571 --> 35:35.468
I need Positive Pete, okay?

35:35.493 --> 35:37.851
I'm gonna hack the sensors
on Murphy's cruiser.

35:37.876 --> 35:40.243
- I just don't know which ones.
- You want me to activate

35:40.311 --> 35:41.780
each of the sensors
in the guidance system?

35:41.805 --> 35:42.882
Yes, yes, yes.

35:42.907 --> 35:43.921
Accelerator,

35:43.946 --> 35:45.646
brakes, power steering.

35:45.671 --> 35:48.751
- You sure about this?
- No, I'm not sure! Just do it.

35:49.444 --> 35:51.688
I am doing it.

35:51.951 --> 35:53.976
30 seconds.

35:55.847 --> 35:59.333
I'm gonna activate the
accelerator first, you ready?

35:59.358 --> 36:00.930
Yes, give me one sec.

36:00.999 --> 36:02.632
There's the accelerator.

36:02.804 --> 36:04.300
Good, now give me steering.

36:04.335 --> 36:05.796
Left turn first.

36:07.264 --> 36:09.431
- Yes.
- Right turn.

36:09.456 --> 36:12.056
All right, it works.

36:12.081 --> 36:14.448
Now, let's go pick up some friends.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.723
Hey, G-man, Federal Agent Vaughn,

36:21.748 --> 36:23.176
we don't care about you.

36:23.203 --> 36:26.067
Just send over Carrot Top and
we'll let your girlfriend go.

36:30.595 --> 36:32.361
- Nice shot.
- I'm out.

36:32.430 --> 36:33.529
That's all I got.

36:33.598 --> 36:35.028
We're sitting ducks now.

36:35.053 --> 36:36.426
Gideon, how far out are you?

36:36.451 --> 36:37.800
Close, very close.

36:37.825 --> 36:39.294
It's not close enough.

36:39.817 --> 36:41.763
All right, all set.

36:41.788 --> 36:43.692
Okay, got everything?

36:44.325 --> 36:46.206
Almost everything.

36:46.231 --> 36:47.550
What does that mean?

36:47.575 --> 36:49.312
It means you're not
gonna be able to back up.

36:49.380 --> 36:50.926
There's no reverse.

36:53.975 --> 36:55.980
Well, this should be fun.

36:57.992 --> 36:59.937
_

37:19.780 --> 37:21.346
Think that was their last round.

37:21.416 --> 37:23.483
- You good to take them out?
- Yeah.

37:33.929 --> 37:35.428
Yahoo!

37:35.497 --> 37:36.601
Yahoo?

37:36.626 --> 37:38.364
Yeah, Dukes of Hazzard, man.

37:45.702 --> 37:48.039
- Gideon, is that you?
- Yep. Kind of.

38:00.792 --> 38:01.912
Get him in the car.

38:01.937 --> 38:03.804
- There's no driver.
- Yes, there is.

38:13.087 --> 38:14.186
All right, come on.

38:14.211 --> 38:15.339
In, in, in.

38:17.482 --> 38:19.253
You got it, you got it, you got it.

38:24.981 --> 38:26.480
Thanks for the ride, Gideon.

38:26.505 --> 38:27.537
Don't mention it.

38:27.562 --> 38:28.694
Get that kid to the hospital.

38:28.719 --> 38:30.129
We're on it, but you
got to give me the wheel.

38:30.154 --> 38:32.098
All right, fine.

38:33.052 --> 38:36.353
Gideon... out.

38:47.402 --> 38:50.036
And that's what they call
the birds and the bees.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.714
Do you have any questions?

38:51.739 --> 38:53.309
I think I'm gonna be sick.

38:54.413 --> 38:56.442
I know. I know it's a lot to take in,

38:56.511 --> 38:58.176
but it's important.

38:58.201 --> 38:59.500
You're growing up.

39:00.090 --> 39:01.723
I want you to know that...

39:02.374 --> 39:04.651
- you can always ask me anything.
- Okay.

39:04.719 --> 39:06.152
I'm here for you.

39:09.558 --> 39:12.270
- Go get ready for practice.
- Okay.

39:13.754 --> 39:15.294
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

39:15.319 --> 39:17.301
- How's Jesse?
- Jesse's good.

39:17.326 --> 39:19.253
The hospital has cable, so...

39:19.278 --> 39:21.000
There you go.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.349
I just wanted to come
by and let you know

39:22.374 --> 39:24.228
they're charging Benoit today.

39:24.272 --> 39:26.223
Yeah, he's going away
for a very long time.

39:26.248 --> 39:28.028
- Thanks to you.
- And you...

39:28.076 --> 39:30.210
and your space sub thingy.

39:34.457 --> 39:36.403
It was nice working with you again.

39:36.428 --> 39:38.606
Actually, that's why I'm here.

39:38.887 --> 39:41.254
Talked to the brass,
told them about you,

39:41.348 --> 39:43.706
and let's just say
there's an FBI application

39:43.731 --> 39:45.231
with your name on it if you want.

39:45.256 --> 39:47.393
- Charlie.
- Better pay. Better hours.

39:48.317 --> 39:49.552
Look...

39:50.694 --> 39:52.934
I don't know how much
time District 13 has left

39:52.959 --> 39:54.367
with Gideon in charge,

39:54.402 --> 39:57.237
but he's done a lot
for us, a lot for me.

39:57.950 --> 39:59.692
I'm gonna see it through with him.

40:00.242 --> 40:02.909
Okay. He's a good guy.

40:02.978 --> 40:05.582
And something tells me
he's not going anywhere.

40:08.489 --> 40:09.749
- Mr. Benoit.
- Mr. Benoit.

40:09.784 --> 40:11.246
Mr. Benoit, what do you
have to say to the charges?

40:12.374 --> 40:14.315
How long have you been
smuggling drugs? Mr. Benoit.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.442
- Mr. Benoit, Mr. Benoit.
- Mr. Benoit.

40:18.786 --> 40:20.270
Mr. Benoit, do you think
this is a government setup?

40:20.295 --> 40:21.909
Mr. Reeves. Mr. Reeves, how does it feel

40:21.934 --> 40:23.044
- to win your company back?
- Pretty good.

40:23.069 --> 40:24.229
- Is it true there's no takeover bid?
- Well...

40:24.254 --> 40:25.551
What's your relationship
with Lauren Fitch?

40:25.576 --> 40:26.599
That's not any of your business.

40:26.624 --> 40:27.634
Tell us about your
new deal with the FBI.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.880
Well...

40:32.623 --> 40:36.184
You guys ever hear of
Lennon and McCartney?

40:37.013 --> 40:39.262
Yes. Hall and Oates?

40:39.770 --> 40:42.020
England Dan and John Ford Coley?

40:42.045 --> 40:44.679
All those guys were okay on their own,

40:44.704 --> 40:46.403
but together they were unstoppable.

40:46.428 --> 40:48.927
That is exactly what Reeves
Industries' partnership

40:48.952 --> 40:50.948
with the FBI is gonna be.

40:50.987 --> 40:54.434
I know everyone's excited about
what the FBI licensing our tech

40:54.459 --> 40:55.747
means for our stock price.

40:55.772 --> 40:57.106
I can't say that I'm not pleased.

40:57.131 --> 41:01.065
It's killed any talk of
a takeover of my company.

41:01.090 --> 41:03.569
But this is also good
for something else...

41:04.145 --> 41:05.715
justice.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.739
Watch out, bad guys,

41:08.764 --> 41:11.270
because the feds have some new toys.

41:11.403 --> 41:14.090
They're actually hand-me-down
toys from the, from the 13th,

41:14.115 --> 41:16.293
but it's, that-that's the whole point

41:16.318 --> 41:17.995
of this experiment, all right?

41:18.020 --> 41:21.020
Listen, guys, I've got to go
help my cops catch some crooks.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.772
I will talk to you later.

41:22.797 --> 41:24.198
No, no, no more questions.

41:24.223 --> 41:25.825
Thank you.

41:25.894 --> 41:26.895
Hello.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.621
You think you're so clever.

41:29.646 --> 41:31.474
Okay, just listen to me because I...

41:31.499 --> 41:34.767
No, no, Ada, I am done listening to you.

41:34.836 --> 41:36.246
We had a deal.

41:36.271 --> 41:39.594
I'm coming, Ada, and I'm going
to destroy you, Gideon Reeves,

41:39.619 --> 41:43.434
and everything that
stands between me and him.

41:58.282 --> 42:01.661
Gideon. It was always your company.

42:01.730 --> 42:03.730
I was only trying to help you keep it.

42:03.798 --> 42:07.501
But now that you've found
someone new to save your ass...

42:08.290 --> 42:10.946
I guess my work here is finally done.

42:10.971 --> 42:13.290
Cheers. Lauren.

42:13.768 --> 42:16.125
Wow. That's my favorite.

42:17.445 --> 42:19.376
- Hey.
- Um, we have to talk.

42:19.401 --> 42:20.908
Hey.

42:20.933 --> 42:22.492
You hear?

42:22.517 --> 42:24.931
We won. The board voted.

42:25.368 --> 42:27.032
Yeah, I know.

42:27.057 --> 42:29.256
So, why do you look like someone

42:29.281 --> 42:31.562
poured battery acid in your cereal?

42:31.587 --> 42:32.876
Because I have to tell you something

42:32.901 --> 42:34.860
and I think you're not gonna like it.

42:35.130 --> 42:37.306
Okay, what-what is it?

42:37.915 --> 42:40.032
I have to quit this job now.

42:40.101 --> 42:41.212
What are you talking about?

42:41.237 --> 42:42.770
I can't explain it. So...

42:42.795 --> 42:44.165
Well, then I don't
accept your resignation.

42:44.190 --> 42:45.255
Not a resignation.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.684
I'm walking out that door
and you can't stop me.

42:48.091 --> 42:49.938
Hey, hey, hey.

42:51.477 --> 42:54.774
If you're in trouble, whatever
the reason, I can fix it.

42:54.799 --> 42:57.181
- Just tell me what it is.
- No, you can't.

42:57.206 --> 42:59.587
- You really can't.
- I... Ada?

42:59.612 --> 43:00.884
Ada!
