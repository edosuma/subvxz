[hums]

03:25.706 --> 03:26.999
And this is for you.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.625
All right. Thank you.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.751
Uh-huh.

03:29.793 --> 03:30.961
See you guys.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.129
Gotta go, buddy.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.589
See you later. [kisses]

03:34.631 --> 03:35.924
See you.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.384
Bye, honey.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.094
-Love you. -[Mary] Love you.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.223
[children chatter indistinctly]

03:43.264 --> 03:45.059
[Mary] All right, here we are.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.643
-Are we ready? -Yeah.

03:47.686 --> 03:48.770
[imitates explosion]

03:48.812 --> 03:50.397
Have a great day, baby!

03:50.438 --> 03:51.690
Bye!

03:51.732 --> 03:53.316
And you, my darling.

[Mary purrs]

04:43.200 --> 04:44.952
-Kioki. Hi. -[laughs] Mary.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.661
So nice to see you.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.247
Dazzling as ever.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.831
I brought my new associate,

04:49.873 --> 04:51.583
-Darlene. -Hi.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.211
You guys have a seat

04:54.253 --> 04:56.130
and I will get us something to drink.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.843
Looks like you're keeping busy.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.638
[Mary] Ohh... you know how it is...

05:04.679 --> 05:06.807
I mean, between the school committees

05:06.848 --> 05:08.558
and then the twins' schedule,

05:08.600 --> 05:10.018
it's just-- it gets so hectic.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.271
I don't know how I ever worked.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.231
[Kioki] We've had a spectacular quarter.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.192
Delirium, as you know, is still our best-selling series.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.237
So, you want to do a spinoff and hire a ghost writer.

05:20.279 --> 05:23.157
You know how I feel about this. Go ahead.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.742
[laughs] Right. Well, actually, along those lines,

05:25.784 --> 05:27.619
-we're stuck. -We're struggling, Mary.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.288
The publishing landscape has changed.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.290
We're going through a massive transition,

05:31.331 --> 05:32.874
and could really use your help.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.169
What? Wh-What is this?

05:35.210 --> 05:36.878
[Kioki] We have an offer for you.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.505
One I think--

05:38.546 --> 05:40.674
The numbers, they make sense.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.635
One more book in the series and we can make it over the edge.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.554
-Get through the transition-- -Stop, stop, stop right now.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.933
Uh, this is not what I thought we were meeting about.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.852
You mislead me, Kioki.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.229
I thought this was something totally different.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.814
Mary, I'm just trying to--

05:55.856 --> 05:57.274
You've been through this before,

05:57.316 --> 05:58.733
you're gonna find a way out,

05:58.775 --> 05:59.776
I know you will.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.402
-Okay? -[Kioki] Mary--

06:01.444 --> 06:02.904
Mary, I assure you, we--

06:05.073 --> 06:06.616
[Mary sighs]

06:08.367 --> 06:10.287
[thunder rumbling]

06:11.246 --> 06:12.664
[Kioki] My apologies.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.840
Your check will continue to arrive every quarter.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.591
Thank you.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.553
[Darlene] Must be nice...

06:26.594 --> 06:29.388
not to have to worry about your children,

06:29.430 --> 06:31.850
whether or not they'll have a roof over their head

06:31.892 --> 06:33.560
or a good school to attend.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.938
You're Mary Morrison, best-selling author.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.566
Yet there was a time when Mary

06:39.607 --> 06:41.902
couldn't even get one publisher to read her work.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.905
So, she resorted to writing salacious stories,

06:44.946 --> 06:47.490
and now gets to sit back and rake in residuals

06:47.532 --> 06:49.701
without a single thought to how she got there

06:49.743 --> 06:51.828
or who put her there.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.580
I am right, aren't I?

06:53.621 --> 06:55.582
[thunder rumbles]

06:56.624 --> 06:58.835
You know nothing about me.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.921
You don't know what you're talking about,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.547
and you should be fired.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.179

07:28.115 --> 07:29.616
Wow, smells great! Hi, kids.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.576
-I made your favorite. -Mmm.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.744
[kisses]

07:32.786 --> 07:34.454
[Tom] Hey, guys.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.872
-[Alexandra] Hi, Dad. -How was school?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.416
[Alexandra] Good.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.307
[Tom] What's this?

07:53.348 --> 07:55.558
I don't know.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.228
Weren't you gonna tell me about this?

07:58.270 --> 08:00.397
It was just a meeting, I didn't think

08:00.439 --> 08:02.232
-it was a big deal-- -No, not that.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.818
You weren't gonna tell me about this offer?

08:07.237 --> 08:09.323
-[Mary] But-- -That's more money up front

08:09.364 --> 08:11.074
than all your other books combined.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.827
Baby, let's have dinner. It's ready, okay?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.704
Kids, hey, go to the table.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.081
Hey, dinnertime.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.256
Honey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to keep anything from you.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.924
-I didn't even see this. -I know,

08:27.966 --> 08:30.093
but you have to seriously consider this.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.886
All right?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.018
I do?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.769
Do I get an A? Do I get an A-?

08:39.811 --> 08:41.646
-B? B+? What is it? -[Tom chuckles]

08:41.688 --> 08:42.939
[audio fades]

08:54.659 --> 08:55.910
Hello.

[moans]

09:24.939 --> 09:26.400
[crickets chirping]

09:34.032 --> 09:35.950
I have something I need to tell you.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.248
Um...

09:42.457 --> 09:44.418
[clears throat] I messed up.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.798
Well, you know that proposal Barry brought me,

09:50.840 --> 09:53.343
and he kinda taunted me to go in with him...

09:53.385 --> 09:55.678
[audio overlapping] It wasn't my... He told me...

09:55.720 --> 09:58.639
...perfect time... got in too early...

09:58.681 --> 10:00.725
...in over our heads... I figured that...

10:00.767 --> 10:02.852
...it was before we ever...

10:02.894 --> 10:04.854
[sharply] When?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.481
When did you make that trade?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.113
Um, six months ago.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.368
Six months ago and you're just telling me?

10:18.410 --> 10:21.079
Tom! How much?

10:22.497 --> 10:24.165
Nearly half, I think it was...

10:25.375 --> 10:27.794
Nearly half of the reserves?

10:27.835 --> 10:30.464
Half of the reserves?!

10:30.505 --> 10:32.132
You-- You promised me!

10:32.173 --> 10:35.051
You swore you would never do that again!

10:36.428 --> 10:37.887
[audio fades]

11:16.384 --> 11:18.386
[moans with pleasure]

11:18.428 --> 11:20.388
You're taking the offer, love.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.266
I don't know.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.852
You've never seen me when I'm writing.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.938
Doesn't matter.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.149
After it's over, you go back to normal, right?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.777
[Mary] Mmm...

11:38.781 --> 11:40.825
I turn into a different person.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.079
[Elaine] This could be the perfect thing

11:45.121 --> 11:46.789
to get your ass out the door.

11:46.831 --> 11:50.377
You could add momentum to enter a new chapter.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.462
To do the things that you want to do

11:52.504 --> 11:55.089
so you can create the things you want to create.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.886
What you need is a full-time sitter.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.263
Oh, what you mean to say is "nanny."

12:02.305 --> 12:05.475
Mm-mm. I did not spend thousands of dollars

12:05.517 --> 12:06.851
to conceive those children

12:06.893 --> 12:08.436
just to spend thousands more

12:08.478 --> 12:10.522
to pay somebody else to take care of them.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.567
I have a client, she's a headhunter for sitters.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.068
Mm-hmm?

12:15.109 --> 12:16.403
Here.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.737
Hmm.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.408
Well, if she's so great,

12:21.449 --> 12:23.034
why aren't you using her?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.536
Well, I can't afford her.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.664
Plus, she only takes on certain clients.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.290
Oh, hell, no!

12:29.332 --> 12:32.544
No, those kids always end up with problems.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.129
I only work at the office three days a week,

12:35.171 --> 12:37.465
but if I had to work full-time,

12:37.507 --> 12:39.384
this is what I would use for child care.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.511
The girls she recruits, they're different.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.054
They go to ivy league schools,

12:43.096 --> 12:44.889
they're fluent in at least two languages,

12:44.931 --> 12:47.141
they cook, they clean, run errands, everything.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.809
I'm telling you, Mary,

12:48.851 --> 12:50.729
it's exactly what you need to get through.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.063
Mm.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.483
[sighs]

13:15.336 --> 13:16.546
[door buzzes]

13:18.256 --> 13:20.841
-Welcome, Ms. Morrison. -[Mary] Thank you. Hi.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.636
Please sign in and then have a seat.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.011
Angela will be with you shortly.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.639
-Okay, thank you. -Mm-hmm.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.398
[Mary gasps, laughs]

13:35.440 --> 13:36.815
Hi!

13:38.652 --> 13:39.860
[footsteps approach]

13:41.529 --> 13:43.406
-[Angela] Hello, Mary. -Hi.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.865
It's so nice to finally meet you.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.534
-I'm Angela. -Nice to meet you.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.328
If you come follow me, I'll show you around.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.579
Sure.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.997
[children giggling]

13:51.038 --> 13:53.082
So, here we have a little activity room.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.875
One of several areas we have in the office.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.127
[Mary] Wow.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.587
[children, nannies chatter]

13:58.546 --> 13:59.880
[Angela] Of course, we have

13:59.922 --> 14:01.758
a state-of-the-art security system.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.849
Most parents prefer to have help inside the home,

14:10.891 --> 14:12.602
but should you ever need to go out of town

14:12.644 --> 14:14.437
and want supervision, we can provide it.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.063
-Huh. -[Angela] I must say, Mary,

14:16.105 --> 14:17.691
I think you will be very pleased

14:17.732 --> 14:19.275
with what we can offer.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.277
Our young women come from impeccable backgrounds.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.363
Many of them are attending prestigious schools

14:23.404 --> 14:25.573
and looking for creative ways to pay tuition.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.242
We provide scholarships based on performance.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.619
How about I send over

14:29.661 --> 14:31.538
a few potentials for you to meet with?

14:31.579 --> 14:32.955
If none of them work out,

14:32.997 --> 14:34.290
we can revisit, go from there.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.958
[children] â™ª Sonnez les matines â™ª

14:36.000 --> 14:37.794
â™ª Ding, dong, ding â™ª

14:37.836 --> 14:39.879
â™ª Ding, dong, ding â™ª

14:39.920 --> 14:41.756
[laughs] Okay, why not?

14:41.798 --> 14:44.050
All right. I'll just get you to fill out some forms.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.385
Okay.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.096
Oh, my God, I love your house!

14:49.138 --> 14:52.684
It has the best lighting ever. It's great for photos.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.519
I recently got engaged, so,

14:54.561 --> 14:57.230
I'm kind of using this as a learning curve for myself.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.066
And one little boy brother, total monster.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.318
I'm so thankful for this opportunity to be here,

15:02.360 --> 15:03.986
-because I love kids. -Mm-hmm.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.322
And I'm just so excited to share the word of God

15:06.364 --> 15:07.741
with your little lambs.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.827
And I'm also a princess entertainer.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.037
-Okay. -I actually have...

15:13.079 --> 15:15.289
my tail in the car.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.583
[squirts]

15:16.624 --> 15:18.918
Yeah, so, I actually have a niece,

15:18.959 --> 15:20.670
um, she's about eight years old.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.714
I'm so happy because when she was a baby

15:22.756 --> 15:25.466
she was gross. [laughs] How old are your kids?

15:25.508 --> 15:26.885
[Tom into phone] Hey, hon.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.512
How are the interviews going?

15:29.554 --> 15:30.889
No one impressive.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.307
But, I mean, they're nice girls.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.851
Not one?

15:34.893 --> 15:37.896
Think you're being a little hard on 'em?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.980
[Mary] Maybe this just isn't a good idea.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.733
[Tom] Mary, I think you're anxious

15:41.775 --> 15:44.026
and apprehensive, but you and I both know

15:44.068 --> 15:46.529
if you don't have any help with the menial stuff,

15:46.571 --> 15:47.906
it'll absolutely kill you.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.741
Plus, it might be good for the kids.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.242
I just can't picture anyone

15:51.284 --> 15:53.119
taking as good a care of them as me.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.954
This isn't easy for me, either.

15:54.995 --> 15:59.333
You're the best mother. No one can replace you.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.670
Oh, honey, wait. I think another one's arriving.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.130
[Tom] All right, bye.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.715
[indistinct chatter]

16:09.218 --> 16:11.554
-[Mary] Hello, hi! -Hi!

16:11.596 --> 16:13.640
You must be with Huntsman Enterprises.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.683
-Yes. -Great! Come on in.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.231
Welcome.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.691
Thank you.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.359
I'm gonna make some tea, if that's okay.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.194
-Yes. -I've been at this all day

16:27.236 --> 16:28.905
and I just need a little pick-me-up.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.698
-Have a seat. -Oh, okay.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.557
[kettle whistling]

17:03.731 --> 17:05.775
[kettle whistling louder]

17:16.577 --> 17:18.287
So, you read a lot?

17:18.329 --> 17:20.832
Oh, uh, yeah.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.543
Sorry. Whenever I can.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.128
But don't worry, I would never around the children.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.630
[Mary] Oh, why not?

17:27.672 --> 17:29.507
Gosh, I think it would be amazing for them

17:29.549 --> 17:31.968
to see a young person reading an actual book.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.261
Lord knows we need more of that these days.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.555
[laughs]

17:35.596 --> 17:36.806
[Mary] There you go.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.683
-[Grace] Thank you. -Mm-hmm.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.059
This is nice.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.310
[Mary] Good.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.479
Mmm.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.025
Oh, uh... Laddie,

17:47.066 --> 17:49.068
-by Gene Stratton-Porter. -Stratton-Porter!

17:49.109 --> 17:52.864
Oh, yes! I read A Girl of the Limberlost.

17:52.906 --> 17:56.034
But it was years ago, I-- Is this as good?

17:56.075 --> 17:59.161
Well, considering it's my third time [laughs]...

17:59.203 --> 18:01.330
-Yes. -Wow.

18:01.372 --> 18:04.834
Porter has this knowledge and passion for nature

18:04.876 --> 18:08.546
coupled with the rich girl- poor boy romance

18:08.588 --> 18:12.216
set in the countryside of the 19th century...

18:12.258 --> 18:14.176
You could say I'm a little obsessed.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.929
-[Mary giggles] -There's this quote,

18:15.970 --> 18:18.056
the mother of the main character,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.934
she hangs in the house.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.227
It has nothing to do with the main plot, but--

18:24.771 --> 18:27.982
"The way to be happy is to be good."

18:31.652 --> 18:34.154
-Hmm. -I'm sorry,

18:34.196 --> 18:35.656
I realize I've never introduced myself.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.324
I'm Grace.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.286
Hi, Grace, nice to meet you. I'm Mary Morrison.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.162
So...

18:42.204 --> 18:45.124
tell me about yourself. Where'd you grow up?

18:45.165 --> 18:48.210
Oh, uh, in a small town

18:48.252 --> 18:50.922
called River Springs. You've probably never heard of it.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.674
Anyway, I grew up there with a large family.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.676
-[phone rings] -Oh, excuse me.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.472
Sorry.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.766
[into phone] Hi!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.183
Uh-huh.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.690
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine with all those conditions. Uh-huh.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.111
[Mary, distant] Well, that's wonderful.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.528
Great, great...

19:25.372 --> 19:27.207
Yeah... That's great!

19:27.249 --> 19:28.960
Great, wonderful news...

19:41.889 --> 19:44.892
[Mary continues talking, indistinct]

19:49.647 --> 19:50.690
[door opens]

19:50.731 --> 19:52.566
[Sam] Mom!

19:52.608 --> 19:54.152
Alex is being mean to me.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.320
No, I'm not. You're just being a big baby.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.364
How is Alex being mean to you?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.033
Who are you?

20:00.074 --> 20:02.035
I'm Grace. I'm a friend of your mom's.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.703
-Mom! -Honey,

20:03.744 --> 20:06.205
your mom is on a really important phone call.

20:06.246 --> 20:09.291
Is that a drawing? Can I see it?

20:10.960 --> 20:14.005
So, then the elephant says to the zookeeper,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.924
how dare you throw mud on me like that?!

20:16.966 --> 20:18.801
-And he got really angry. -[Sam laughs]

20:18.843 --> 20:21.303
-Thank you so much, bye. -[Grace] So he took a big,

20:21.345 --> 20:23.681
deep breath and sprayed

20:23.723 --> 20:25.265
all this water on the zookeeper

20:25.307 --> 20:27.101
and the zookeeper was drenched!

20:27.143 --> 20:28.602
[laughing]

20:28.644 --> 20:30.813
[trumpets]

20:30.855 --> 20:32.857
Hi, guys, how was school?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.567
-Super awesome! -Great!

20:34.608 --> 20:37.153
Good. Well, this is excellent!

20:37.195 --> 20:38.571
Wow!

20:38.612 --> 20:40.073
Can you guys go play in your room

20:40.114 --> 20:41.866
while Grace and I finish our meeting?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.325
-Sure. -I'll be in soon.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.495
Ooh!

20:46.537 --> 20:48.956
I didn't realize Blume wrote other stories.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.417
If this were a library, I would check it out.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.128
[laughs] Well, if you like that one...

20:54.170 --> 20:55.671
follow me.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.884
Okay, I'm gonna pick a really good book for you.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.513
[Mary quietly] Oh, this one's good.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.737
Wait, you're a writer?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.572
These are your books?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.200
Well, yeah, but I haven't written in a while.

21:24.242 --> 21:28.162
I can't believe I'm standing in the home

21:28.204 --> 21:30.372
of an actual writer!

21:30.414 --> 21:32.083
[laughs]

21:34.835 --> 21:36.420
Grace, um...

21:36.462 --> 21:39.423
I don't know if I really need someone full-time,

21:39.465 --> 21:41.968
but I definitely need some help next week

21:42.009 --> 21:43.385
if you're up for it.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.096
because I'm starting a new book.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.764
Are you serious?

21:48.348 --> 21:49.892
That would be incredible.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.103
If you need to look for something more full-time,

21:52.145 --> 21:53.604
I totally understand.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.689
No, no, no, this is perfect.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.691
-Okay, great! -Thank you!

21:57.733 --> 21:58.985
Oh, thank you so much!

21:59.026 --> 22:01.779
[laughs] Okay.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.405
Well,

22:04.490 --> 22:05.992
I will see you on Monday.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.451
See you on Monday. Thank you.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.703
You're welcome! [laughs]

22:09.745 --> 22:11.789
[sigh of relief]

22:39.275 --> 22:42.486
[no audible dialogue]

22:52.038 --> 22:53.622
She can't be real.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.292
I need to get me one of those.

22:56.334 --> 22:59.086
Oh, don't get too excited, I only have her a week.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.341
She's cute, though.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.591
Hello.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.968
Mom, can we go swimming, please?

23:06.010 --> 23:07.887
-Yeah, please, can we go? -Please?

23:07.928 --> 23:10.181
I can take them, if you'd like.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.144
-Okay. Yes, okay. -Yes!

23:15.186 --> 23:16.979
-[kids laugh] -Oh, my, oh, my.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.814
Grace, do you want to borrow a suit?

23:18.856 --> 23:20.900
I have one if you want to try one of mine.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.986
-Yeah, that'd be great. -[Mary] Okay.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.509
Would you like a cover-up?

23:47.551 --> 23:50.012
-Yeah. -[laughs] Here you go.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.722
Thank you.

23:53.431 --> 23:55.101
-Let me help. -Yeah.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.310
[laughs]

23:57.395 --> 23:58.896
[Grace] Whoa!

24:16.122 --> 24:19.375
The only one-piece you have, and it just happens to be

24:19.417 --> 24:22.002
from the cover of a Playboy swimsuit magazine?

24:22.044 --> 24:24.713
Oh, listen, I do not need to worry about her.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.132
She is a prude!

24:26.173 --> 24:28.384
And you know what they say about prudes.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.642
I have nothing to worry about with her.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.894
I mean, if anything, she needs my help.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.108
Hey, babe!

24:45.401 --> 24:47.153
Hey, nice to meet you, I'm Tom.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.076
[Tom] I'm gonna go change real quick.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.554
[Mary] Bye, sweetheart,

25:14.596 --> 25:15.806
I'll see you tomorrow!

25:15.848 --> 25:17.599
-[Elaine] Bye, babe! -[Mary] Bye!

25:19.393 --> 25:21.145
-Wow! -Mm-hmm.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.939
[chuckles] Well, what is this?

25:23.981 --> 25:26.608
Well, you tell me.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.821
[stammers] I don't-- I don't know.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.744
-Mmm. -[kids chatter indistinctly]

25:40.247 --> 25:41.539
[both moan]

25:41.581 --> 25:43.541
-[kisses] -[chuckles]

25:45.002 --> 25:47.171
When's the last time we did it in the kitchen?

25:47.213 --> 25:48.464
Oh, my.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.594
[moans]

25:54.636 --> 25:56.972
Mm, mm! Wow!

25:59.183 --> 26:01.477
-Mm. Right? -Uh-huh.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.483
Come, come, come.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.651
Come.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.918
Yeah.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.260
[heavy breathing]

26:35.593 --> 26:36.803
[moans]

27:00.077 --> 27:01.454
Hi!

27:01.495 --> 27:03.247
If it's fine with you guys,

27:03.289 --> 27:05.665
I'd like to get them in the shower and ready for bed?

27:05.707 --> 27:07.501
Oh, no, no, that's okay. I'll do it.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.836
No, no. That sounds great.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.380
Thanks.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.549
Okay. Okay, great. Come on, guys, let's go.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.050
Yeah.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.472
[chuckles]

27:19.513 --> 27:21.723
I have my girlfriend back, huh?

27:21.765 --> 27:23.976
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm! -Pretty fun.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.353
Mmm.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.613
[water running]

27:35.653 --> 27:37.697
Okay. Okay, guys, come on in.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.160
Okay?

27:42.286 --> 27:43.996
Ahh, yes.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.039
Mm, I am impressed.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.749
-Not bad, right? -Mm-hmm.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.464
Oh, Grace.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.966
You wanna join us for dinner, maybe?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.593
Oh, that's so kind.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.052
But I'm a firm believer

27:59.094 --> 28:01.013
that this is important family time.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.642
They're in their room, playing, ready for bed.

28:04.682 --> 28:07.394
-Today was so fun. -[Mary laughs]

28:07.436 --> 28:09.146
See you first thing in the morning?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.856
Yes, thank you so much, Grace.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.192
-Okay, thanks. Good night. -[Mary] Good night.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.530
[sighs]

28:17.571 --> 28:20.115
[giggles] What?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.743
[laughs]

28:29.124 --> 28:30.459
[sighs]

28:40.093 --> 28:41.887
-Hi! -[Grace] Hi.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.722
I brought you some goodies.

28:43.763 --> 28:46.517
Grace, you did not have to do this.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.019
You don't have to take care of the kids and me.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.021
I know, but I like to.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.690
Please let me.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.276
Okay! It's adorable.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.612
Today's goal is the kitchen,

28:58.654 --> 28:59.779
tomorrow is the office.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.615
[Mary] Wow!

29:01.657 --> 29:03.283
You are a godsend.

29:03.325 --> 29:04.577
[laughs]

29:12.792 --> 29:14.211
Mmm.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.508
[sighs]

29:39.027 --> 29:42.740
[Mary screaming]

29:42.781 --> 29:45.701
Ooh! Ah!

29:45.743 --> 29:47.827
Ah! Ooh.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.705
Thank you, Grace.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.167
Ugh, I don't usually take a bath at 11:00 in the morning,

29:54.209 --> 29:55.711
but I just thought maybe it would

29:55.753 --> 29:57.379
get the ideas flowing, you know?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.173
Ah.

30:01.592 --> 30:02.801
Ow! Ooh!

30:02.842 --> 30:04.511
Eee!

30:05.638 --> 30:06.846
[sighs]

30:17.983 --> 30:20.193
You know what I think we should do today?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.028
Play hooky.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.323
But what about--

30:24.364 --> 30:25.949
It'll all be here when we get back.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.160
Come on.

30:30.203 --> 30:33.165
-[Mary] Here we are! -[door bell jingles]

30:33.206 --> 30:34.874
[pop music playing over speakers]

30:34.916 --> 30:37.919
Oh, this is too much, really.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.005
No, Grace, you deserve it!

30:41.298 --> 30:43.550
[Mary] Um, excuse me.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.470
Could you fit my young friend here for a new bra?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.221
Oh, no problem, follow me this way.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.556
Okay.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.357
Okay. Be right back.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.361
-[laughs] -I'm excited!

31:03.487 --> 31:04.863
Me, too.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.451
[sales woman] All right, here's a few.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.077
Excellent.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.121
Let me know if you need anything else, okay?

31:13.163 --> 31:14.623
Thank you.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.583
Let's try this one, it's so pretty!

31:18.001 --> 31:19.878
How does this feel? Let's have a look.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.171
Um...

31:21.213 --> 31:23.465
-Oh! -It's a little tight.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.133
It's so lovely, though!

31:25.175 --> 31:26.259
Here, let me adjust it.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.594
That's good.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.929
It's so pretty!

31:31.390 --> 31:33.350
Oh, that's so nice.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.560
Better.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.019
-Yay! -[laughs]

31:36.061 --> 31:37.396
Okay, let's try one more.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.398
-Okay. -Here, let's try this one.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.985
Okay, so this...

31:44.027 --> 31:45.779
Let me get it for you?

31:47.113 --> 31:49.825
There you go. This one is a front closure.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.786
Let me help you.

31:52.828 --> 31:55.288
Oh.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.583
I remember when mine used to look like this.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.167
[laughs]

31:59.209 --> 32:01.670
I never understood why anyone wanted to go bigger.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.756
I can barely keep these in order.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.966
I agree, totally, yes.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.387
There. Wow!

32:12.723 --> 32:14.057
Turn around.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.560
Have you ever heard the phrase,

32:16.602 --> 32:19.438
"Youth is wasted on the young"?

32:19.479 --> 32:21.690
That's how I feel about me. I wish...

32:21.732 --> 32:24.150
that when I was young, I had spent more time

32:24.192 --> 32:26.069
just feeling good about my body

32:26.111 --> 32:29.448
rather than worrying about all of my perceived shortcomings.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.866
[chuckles]

32:30.908 --> 32:32.284
This looks lovely.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.623
In case you wanted to remember.

32:38.998 --> 32:40.459
[knock on door]

32:40.500 --> 32:41.835
Um, yes?

32:41.877 --> 32:43.253
How we doing in there, ladies?

32:43.295 --> 32:45.589
Great. Some of these are gonna work.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.424
[sales woman] Great, good to hear.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.636
[Mary] All right!

32:51.595 --> 32:53.221
Also, I have all these clothes

32:53.263 --> 32:54.848
that I don't really wear anymore.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.224
So, why don't you try 'em on,

32:56.266 --> 32:57.392
see if anything fits.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.102
-Okay. -Okay!

33:05.108 --> 33:07.193
-Honey? -Hmm?

33:07.235 --> 33:09.988
What do you think about women who get plastic surgery?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.449
What do you mean, fake boobs?

33:12.491 --> 33:15.076
-I mean-- -Mm, maybe something else.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.872
Like a fake butt? [chuckles]

33:18.914 --> 33:21.374
-I love your ass. -You sure?

33:21.416 --> 33:24.294
-Yeah. -I don't know, though.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.463
I mean, maybe I ought to consider it.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.760
You know, it's not like I'm..

33:31.802 --> 33:33.720
thirty-five anymore.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.557
Maybe, just,

33:37.599 --> 33:40.143
you know, like, a little nip,

33:40.185 --> 33:42.103
a little tuck, like a little...

33:42.145 --> 33:44.314
something. What do you think?

33:47.693 --> 33:49.486
You know what really gets me off?

33:50.654 --> 33:52.322
What I find most exciting?

33:53.782 --> 33:55.033
Your brilliance.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.453
You're not only hot and perfect,

33:58.495 --> 34:00.664
you're the most amazing mother to our children,

34:00.706 --> 34:04.167
and you have the most creative and intuitive mind

34:04.209 --> 34:06.003
that I've ever interacted with.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.129
I have the pleasure of living with that mind

34:08.171 --> 34:09.297
every day of my life.

34:09.339 --> 34:10.632
[clicks tongue]

34:10.674 --> 34:12.885
Mmm, really?

34:12.926 --> 34:15.261
Yes, really.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.227
-Oh! -Sorry!

34:22.268 --> 34:23.729
I don't mean to interrupt.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.939
I just wanted to let you know, Mary,

34:25.981 --> 34:28.191
that I'm gonna be in a little late tomorrow.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.693
I have a doctor's appointment.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.070
-Okay. -The kids are in bed, asleep.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.822
Thanks, good night.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.574
All right, good night.

34:38.660 --> 34:40.037
[door closes]

34:41.872 --> 34:43.289
Mmm.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.376
[tapping]

34:53.759 --> 34:55.093
[exhales]

34:59.472 --> 35:00.682
[clicks lighter]

35:05.729 --> 35:07.188
[blows]

35:09.066 --> 35:10.358
[puffs]

36:40.239 --> 36:42.075
[birds cawing]

37:32.625 --> 37:34.335
[Kioki] Mary, what do you think?

37:34.377 --> 37:36.171
I'm sorry, what?

37:37.463 --> 37:40.133
Of the mother being the killer in the end?

37:43.803 --> 37:48.016
You want our hero to suddenly become the villain?

37:48.058 --> 37:50.268
That's your idea of a twist?

37:50.309 --> 37:52.395
I mean, it's on point

37:52.437 --> 37:54.480
with where everything's headed right now.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.815
On trend, don't you think?

37:55.857 --> 37:57.943
Yes! Take this woman,

37:57.984 --> 37:59.903
who we made into a hero and--

37:59.945 --> 38:02.405
Flip it. Make her the anti-hero.

38:02.447 --> 38:05.033
That's not actually the way it works.

38:05.075 --> 38:06.785
I like it.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.703
Just a thought.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.247
You're the professional.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.958
We trust you. You'll come up with something.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.459
Always do.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.877
Are there any other notes

38:15.919 --> 38:17.754
we want to give Mary while we're here?

38:17.796 --> 38:19.965
I love how you paint your characters,

38:20.006 --> 38:21.674
your descriptions, the world.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.718
You're excellent at this, Mary.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.971
Just think there's a real opportunity here

38:26.012 --> 38:28.473
for you to explore her darker side.

38:28.514 --> 38:31.434
She's longing for something more.

38:31.476 --> 38:35.272
Your words are so vivid on the page...

38:58.377 --> 39:01.965
...think if you could somehow weave this into her back story,

39:02.007 --> 39:04.676
then you would have something truly special.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.553
Okay.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.889
All right.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.185
[Mary exhales]

39:14.602 --> 39:17.147
Have you ever been attracted to a woman before?

39:20.399 --> 39:21.901
Are you sure? Think about it.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.402
No. [laughs]

39:23.444 --> 39:26.156
It could all be in your head.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.325
A subconscious fantasy.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.243
It's like, one minute

39:30.285 --> 39:32.912
she's like this innocent young child, you know?

39:32.954 --> 39:37.042
Then the next minute, it's like she's this master seductress

39:37.083 --> 39:39.711
and I'm just her lap dog waiting for the next treat.

39:39.752 --> 39:43.215
Honestly, you're probably just sex starved.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.592
No, no. [whispers] Tom is amazing!

39:46.634 --> 39:48.594
No complaints there.

39:51.014 --> 39:55.643
I mean, in this strange, sexual servant type of way,

39:55.685 --> 39:58.897
I feel like she would do whatever I asked her to do.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.648
To me.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.235
That's bad of me to think like that, isn't it?

40:03.276 --> 40:06.905
Careful, love, maybe this is her plan.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.656
Get you hooked on her so that

40:08.698 --> 40:11.951
she can overthrow your kingdom and take everything in it.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.453
Really?

40:14.495 --> 40:16.039
[laughs] No, I'm just kidding.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.791
I told you, strange things happen when I write.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.293
I'll say.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.545
Make her your muse, then.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.839
Use her and this thing and write about it.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.966
You said you're having writer's block, right?

40:27.008 --> 40:28.801
-Yeah. -You're already paying for her.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.512
Get the most bang for your buck.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.099
[Mary] Hmm!

40:37.602 --> 40:39.437
[Tom] Whoa. That is a crazy story.

40:39.478 --> 40:41.314
You must have been some tough kid.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.649
[Grace] Yep, my grandpa always said

40:43.691 --> 40:45.526
I was the grandson he always wanted,

40:45.568 --> 40:47.570
and finally got.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.199
Oh, hey, hon.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.575
[Mary] Hi.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.910
[Alex] Come on!

40:53.952 --> 40:55.661
-[kisses] -[Sam] Okay, look at me.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.538
How was your workout?

40:57.580 --> 41:00.250
-[Mary] Good! I'm sore. -[Grace chuckles]

41:03.753 --> 41:05.338
[Alex] Mommy!

41:05.380 --> 41:06.672
I got it.

41:07.673 --> 41:09.467
Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.052
What's going on?

41:11.094 --> 41:14.847
[kids talking, indistinct]

41:14.889 --> 41:18.226
What, did your instructor make you horny again?

41:18.268 --> 41:21.604
[laughs] God, no!

41:21.646 --> 41:23.815
But I do think we should go out tonight.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.108
[Tom] Oh, yeah,

41:25.150 --> 41:26.484
we have that fundraising dinner.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.569
-[Mary] That's tonight? -Yeah.

41:28.611 --> 41:29.988
I totally forgot.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.489
I didn't even book a sitter.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.491
I'm not doing anything tonight.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.952
Um, if you need me to stay late, I can.

41:51.176 --> 41:52.469
Oh, Grace.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.886
[Grace] Hmm?

41:55.930 --> 41:57.723
-Can you help me? -Yeah.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.146
-All right. -Stunning.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.856
-Thank you, really? Great. -Mm-hmm.

42:04.897 --> 42:06.774
[Tom] We better leave now

42:06.816 --> 42:08.567
-if we're not gonna be late. -Okay, I'm coming.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.111
-[sighs] -What is it?

42:11.237 --> 42:13.572
I just wanted to say thank you.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.533
I mean, this job,

42:15.574 --> 42:18.328
you, Tom, the kids, it--

42:19.537 --> 42:21.206
It means the world to me, Mary.

42:21.247 --> 42:22.623
Oh.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.463
Listen, Grace.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.465
You...

42:30.507 --> 42:32.633
are a very special young lady

42:32.675 --> 42:34.844
and we are lucky to have you.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.137
Are we going?

42:36.179 --> 42:37.972
Yeah, yeah, of course we are.

42:38.014 --> 42:40.183
All right, we'll be back before midnight, okay?

42:40.225 --> 42:41.393
-No problem. -All right.

42:41.434 --> 42:42.685
-Have fun. -Thanks, Grace.

42:42.727 --> 42:43.936
Good night, Grace.

42:51.777 --> 42:53.405
[garage door opening]

42:53.446 --> 42:55.407
She said she was one of eight children.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.658
Mm-hm. I knew she was home-schooled.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.328
So I...

43:00.370 --> 43:02.163
don't really know her whole story,

43:02.205 --> 43:04.040
but from what I gather,

43:04.082 --> 43:07.085
we're the only people she has.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.003
Do you think...

43:09.045 --> 43:11.381
we should make her more a part of the family?

43:11.423 --> 43:12.798
[seatbelt clicks]

43:25.353 --> 43:26.645
[grunts]

43:28.898 --> 43:30.567
Shh.

43:32.651 --> 43:35.405
[humming "Hush Little Baby"]

43:47.917 --> 43:50.420
[continues humming lullaby]

44:02.265 --> 44:04.892
-Oh, there they are! -Hi!

44:04.934 --> 44:07.395
Hello, thank you for coming.

44:07.437 --> 44:10.565
-So nice to see you. -Great to see you!

44:10.607 --> 44:11.816
Thank you!

44:11.857 --> 44:13.276
[gasps] And here she is!

44:13.318 --> 44:16.571
The boss lady, who is looking amazing!

44:16.613 --> 44:18.697
-The boss lady, mmm! [laughs] -Thank you.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.408
Look at those earrings, I love them!

44:20.450 --> 44:23.161
-Thank you, thank you, baby. -Oh!

44:24.329 --> 44:26.247
-Every seat filled. -[Mary gasps]

44:26.289 --> 44:28.416
Tonight alone will raise more money

44:28.458 --> 44:30.376
than all the other fundraisers combined.

44:30.418 --> 44:32.086
-Amazing! -Cheers!

44:32.128 --> 44:34.672
-Congratulations! -How's the writing going, Mary?

44:34.713 --> 44:36.007
I hear you're in the midst

44:36.048 --> 44:38.134
of adding another book to the series?

44:38.176 --> 44:41.346
All I can say is... finally.

44:41.387 --> 44:44.265
[Elaine] Okay, Rick, leave her alone,

44:44.307 --> 44:46.309
she doesn't want to talk about that tonight.

44:46.351 --> 44:47.893
-That's true. -[Elaine laughs]

44:47.935 --> 44:49.895
Live music is a rarity.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.482
-Uh-oh. -That must be you.

44:52.524 --> 44:54.733
[Elaine laughs]

44:54.775 --> 44:56.735
-All right. -All right.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.404
[Mary] So...

44:59.405 --> 45:01.616
to answer your question, yes.

45:01.658 --> 45:03.742
I am going to write another book

45:03.784 --> 45:05.203
to add to my series,

45:05.244 --> 45:06.996
but there's just one problem...

45:08.331 --> 45:11.292
I really don't want to write it.

45:11.334 --> 45:13.378
Well, book four has to be my favorite.

45:13.419 --> 45:15.588
Yeah, you and everybody else,

45:15.630 --> 45:17.382
but can I tell you something?

1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:05.772
I think we should stop.

1:07:06.773 --> 1:07:08.525
-Did I-- -No, no, no.

1:07:08.566 --> 1:07:10.610
You're perfect.

1:07:10.652 --> 1:07:14.865
You're so, so perfect.

1:07:26.668 --> 1:07:27.878
[gasps]

1:07:29.212 --> 1:07:31.172
Who would do such a thing?

1:07:32.423 --> 1:07:34.258
I've gotta call Tom.

1:07:34.300 --> 1:07:36.344
[frog croaking]

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:38.596
[footsteps approaching]

1:07:38.638 --> 1:07:40.473
[Elaine] ...what I think.

1:07:40.515 --> 1:07:42.809
-[Tom] If it matches with what I think--

1:07:40.515 --> 1:07:42.809
-[Mary] Hey!

1:07:42.851 --> 1:07:45.812
Hey, I've been trying to call you, where've you been?

1:07:45.854 --> 1:07:48.439
Oh, I guess I left my phone inside. So, sorry.

1:07:48.481 --> 1:07:50.191
Where'd you guys go?

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:52.235
-We-- -Well, we thought about--

1:07:52.276 --> 1:07:53.820
[both laugh]

1:07:53.862 --> 1:07:55.613
We went to this place by the river,

1:07:55.655 --> 1:07:57.407
it was extraordinary.

1:07:57.448 --> 1:07:59.743
You remember that wooded area that we found a while back?

1:07:59.784 --> 1:08:01.786
Where you took me a few years ago?

1:08:01.828 --> 1:08:03.955
Mm-hmm! Finally got some time to explore.

1:08:03.997 --> 1:08:06.750
Well, maybe you'll take me there sometime.

1:08:08.543 --> 1:08:09.794
Let me see this.

1:08:11.379 --> 1:08:12.756
What's going on?

1:08:12.797 --> 1:08:14.632
[Elaine] It's probably nothing, but--

1:08:15.926 --> 1:08:18.177
What?

1:08:18.219 --> 1:08:20.847
When was the last time you were intimate with Tom?

1:08:20.889 --> 1:08:22.974
I don't know, like, uh...

1:08:23.016 --> 1:08:25.435
I guess before I started writing.

1:08:26.978 --> 1:08:28.271
You know what they say,

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:29.773
if he's not getting it from you,

1:08:29.814 --> 1:08:32.025
where is he getting it from?

1:08:32.067 --> 1:08:34.277
Oh, come on!

1:08:34.318 --> 1:08:37.488
You're actually-- You're saying you think Tom--?

1:08:37.530 --> 1:08:39.657
I mean, seriously.

1:08:39.699 --> 1:08:42.243
First, you're just criticizing Grace.

1:08:42.285 --> 1:08:44.996
Now, you're all paranoid about Tom.

1:08:45.038 --> 1:08:47.206
I mean, why don't you tell me what's going on.

1:08:47.248 --> 1:08:49.417
-What?! -I mean, seriously.

1:08:49.459 --> 1:08:50.961
First there's the fundraiser,

1:08:51.002 --> 1:08:52.837
I saw the way you were looking at him.

1:08:52.879 --> 1:08:54.005
Stop it.

1:08:54.047 --> 1:08:55.339
What are you doing here now?

1:08:55.381 --> 1:08:56.967
What were you guys talking about?

1:08:57.008 --> 1:08:58.635
I was here to talk about you.

1:08:58.676 --> 1:09:01.262
Me? What about me?

1:09:04.641 --> 1:09:07.727
Let's talk when we can get a little bit more privacy.

1:09:07.769 --> 1:09:09.771
But just know that I love you

1:09:09.813 --> 1:09:11.606
and I only want what's best for you.

1:09:11.648 --> 1:09:13.274
You have to know that.

1:09:17.528 --> 1:09:18.947
[engine starts]

1:09:26.663 --> 1:09:27.872
Mmm!

1:09:27.914 --> 1:09:29.290
Something smells good.

1:09:29.332 --> 1:09:31.542
One of my family's secret recipes.

1:09:31.584 --> 1:09:33.837
Something my aunt used to make.

1:09:36.714 --> 1:09:38.133
Tom and the kids are...?

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:40.176
On a walk, I think.

1:09:43.013 --> 1:09:44.722
Oh, babe! Oh, no.

1:09:44.764 --> 1:09:46.641
Let me help you.

1:09:46.683 --> 1:09:48.601
Put it down.

1:09:48.643 --> 1:09:50.520
Let's be very careful.

1:09:50.561 --> 1:09:52.605
Look. Ta-da!

1:09:55.608 --> 1:09:57.276
[Mary chuckles]

1:09:58.653 --> 1:10:00.488
No more E.R. visits.

1:10:01.948 --> 1:10:03.199
Let me get you some chili.

1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:04.534
Okay.

1:10:12.333 --> 1:10:13.793
Mmm.

1:10:13.835 --> 1:10:15.670
Do you know how beautiful you are?

1:10:15.712 --> 1:10:17.088
[chuckles]

1:10:19.132 --> 1:10:20.717
Did you know that

1:10:20.758 --> 1:10:24.303
tomorrow is my and Tom's anniversary?

1:10:24.345 --> 1:10:26.681
I hope when I'm older I look as good as you.

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:29.517
[laughs] Ten years!

1:10:29.559 --> 1:10:31.561
Did you hear me, Mary?

1:10:33.479 --> 1:10:34.772
I bought a new dress,

1:10:34.814 --> 1:10:36.566
it's black and it's backless.

1:10:36.607 --> 1:10:37.692
I hope he likes it.

1:10:37.734 --> 1:10:38.985
Mary.

1:10:39.027 --> 1:10:40.611
Please.

1:10:41.696 --> 1:10:43.322
You deserve this.

1:10:49.871 --> 1:10:51.081
[gasps]

1:10:55.334 --> 1:10:56.586
[Grace moans]

1:10:58.171 --> 1:10:59.630
[breathing heavily]

1:11:00.590 --> 1:11:01.883
[Grace] Oh!

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:04.385
[heartbeat]

1:11:07.055 --> 1:11:09.099
[Grace] Ahh...

1:11:09.140 --> 1:11:10.725
-[door opens] -[Sam] Mom?

1:11:12.018 --> 1:11:13.436
[door closes]

1:11:13.477 --> 1:11:15.688
Hey, it smells great! What's cooking?

1:11:15.730 --> 1:11:18.315
-Yeah, I'm starving. -[Sam] Me, too.

1:11:18.357 --> 1:11:22.570
I--I'm just suddenly not feeling so great, baby.

1:11:22.612 --> 1:11:24.739
I think I'm just gonna go lay down, okay?

1:11:24.781 --> 1:11:26.157
I'll get you some water.

1:11:26.199 --> 1:11:28.034
[Mary] Thanks, honey.

1:11:28.076 --> 1:11:30.453
Hey, guys, how was the park?

1:11:31.579 --> 1:11:32.747
[groans]

1:11:37.127 --> 1:11:38.544
[Tom] Here you go.

1:11:38.586 --> 1:11:39.921
I love you, babe.

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:42.381
Mm, love you more.

1:11:46.219 --> 1:11:48.012
[sighs]

1:11:49.139 --> 1:11:50.473
Tom.

1:12:18.251 --> 1:12:20.503
[Grace, distant] Not that hard, you idiot!

1:12:22.005 --> 1:12:23.756
[indistinct distant yelling]

1:12:27.885 --> 1:12:29.220
[Grace moans]

1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:35.601
[Tom and Grace moaning]

1:12:43.818 --> 1:12:45.320
[moaning continues]

1:12:49.991 --> 1:12:51.534
[Grace] Slower!

1:12:52.743 --> 1:12:54.745
[Tom and Grace breathing heavily]

1:12:56.289 --> 1:12:57.790
[Grace] There.

1:12:57.832 --> 1:12:59.334
Oh, that's it.

1:13:00.918 --> 1:13:03.838
[both panting, moaning]

1:13:05.756 --> 1:13:06.966
[Grace] Now!

1:13:17.685 --> 1:13:20.479
Oh, that's a good boy.

1:13:29.030 --> 1:13:30.531
Who's in charge?

1:13:31.991 --> 1:13:34.869
I said, who's in charge

1:13:34.911 --> 1:13:37.747
and will always be in charge?!

1:13:47.006 --> 1:13:48.674
[Grace] Don't worry,

1:13:48.716 --> 1:13:50.593
she won't remember any of this.

1:14:20.623 --> 1:14:22.041
[Tom] You feeling better?

1:14:22.083 --> 1:14:23.960
Yeah, sort of, yeah.

1:14:24.001 --> 1:14:26.212
Just had a horrible dream.

1:14:28.172 --> 1:14:30.300
Sam, Alex, time for dinner.

1:14:33.469 --> 1:14:35.512
Come on, take your seat.

1:14:35.554 --> 1:14:37.098
No more video games.

1:14:40.684 --> 1:14:42.937
Well, as long as you survived your dream,

1:14:42.979 --> 1:14:44.272
that's all that matters.

1:14:47.900 --> 1:14:51.154
[Mary] Um, Grace, uh...

1:14:52.696 --> 1:14:55.241
I seem to remember you saying that

1:14:55.283 --> 1:14:57.660
this was sacred family time.

1:14:57.701 --> 1:14:59.078
So...

1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:01.580
what the hell are you still doing here?

1:15:01.622 --> 1:15:04.041
[Tom] What are you saying? What are you talking about?

1:15:04.083 --> 1:15:05.501
Um, she's right.

1:15:07.086 --> 1:15:08.879
Must have been a pretty awful dream.

1:15:08.921 --> 1:15:11.299
Teacher says a bad dream is actually a nightmare.

1:15:11.341 --> 1:15:13.550
You and my husband

1:15:13.592 --> 1:15:15.136
-were fucking! -[Tom] Mary!

1:15:15.178 --> 1:15:17.054
Over there, on the counter!

1:15:17.096 --> 1:15:18.722
-Damn it! -It was so real!

1:15:18.764 --> 1:15:20.350
It was so real!

1:15:20.391 --> 1:15:22.518
And you were like a totally different person,

1:15:22.559 --> 1:15:23.894
you were like somebody else.

1:15:23.936 --> 1:15:26.189
[Alex] Daddy, Mommy's scaring me.

1:15:26.230 --> 1:15:27.690
[Tom] I know honey,

1:15:27.731 --> 1:15:29.150
Mommy's not feeling very well.

1:15:29.192 --> 1:15:31.027
I think you need to go back and rest.

1:15:31.068 --> 1:15:33.237
[crying] You guys, I'm sorry.

1:15:33.279 --> 1:15:35.739
I'm really sorry.

1:15:38.242 --> 1:15:39.660
When Mommy writes,

1:15:39.702 --> 1:15:43.164
sometimes the things in her mind are so vivid

1:15:43.206 --> 1:15:45.791
that she can't tell the difference between

1:15:45.833 --> 1:15:48.752
the imaginary and the real.

1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:56.760
What happened to you out there?

1:15:56.802 --> 1:15:58.637
[Mary] I don't know.

1:15:58.679 --> 1:16:00.973
I'm not really sure.

1:16:08.147 --> 1:16:10.900
[sighs] Actually--

1:16:13.569 --> 1:16:15.321
I do know, actually.

1:16:16.364 --> 1:16:17.823
You know that nightmare?

1:16:19.616 --> 1:16:21.952
That's really how I feel about us.

1:16:21.994 --> 1:16:23.538
That's how I feel about you,

1:16:23.579 --> 1:16:25.456
that's how I feel about everything.

1:16:25.498 --> 1:16:28.501
Because for the longest time,

1:16:28.543 --> 1:16:31.462
I've just been sitting in the backseat

1:16:31.504 --> 1:16:33.506
and I've been letting you drive.

1:16:33.548 --> 1:16:34.840
And I've been supporting you

1:16:34.882 --> 1:16:37.510
in everything that you wanted to do.

1:16:37.552 --> 1:16:41.514
And I've been taking all of my energies and all of my talents,

1:16:41.556 --> 1:16:43.682
and pouring them into you

1:16:43.724 --> 1:16:46.727
and into the kids and into this life.

1:16:46.769 --> 1:16:49.939
Because I wanted to build something together.

1:16:49.980 --> 1:16:52.442
And what do I get for it?!

1:16:52.483 --> 1:16:54.651
What do I get for it?!

1:16:54.693 --> 1:16:56.487
Fucking screwed!

1:16:56.529 --> 1:16:58.697
You betrayed me!

1:16:58.739 --> 1:17:00.616
-You crash us into a wall -Come on, Mary--

1:17:00.657 --> 1:17:02.159
-and then, and then -Mary--

1:17:02.201 --> 1:17:05.204
you expect me to pick up the pieces

1:17:05.246 --> 1:17:06.914
and make everything better again!

1:17:06.956 --> 1:17:08.624
-Mary, I'm sorry. -No!

1:17:08.665 --> 1:17:10.418
-Come here. -No, don't comfort me!

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:11.961
-Come here. -Don't comfort me!

1:17:12.002 --> 1:17:13.463
I'm sorry!

1:17:13.504 --> 1:17:15.256
I'm sorry, I fucked up.

1:17:15.298 --> 1:17:17.967
But you're my world, you're everything to me.

1:17:18.008 --> 1:17:19.676
You and the twins.

1:17:22.597 --> 1:17:25.099
I want to find a way to make it up to you.

1:17:25.141 --> 1:17:26.934
I promise, I will.

1:17:26.976 --> 1:17:29.228
And you're right, we're never gonna

1:17:29.270 --> 1:17:32.064
-live like that again. -No! You're damn straight!

1:17:32.106 --> 1:17:33.566
Yeah.

1:17:34.775 --> 1:17:36.611
-You mean everything to me. -[sniffs]

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:39.530
Come on. You're almost through.

1:17:39.572 --> 1:17:41.616
Just let's not let this thing

1:17:41.657 --> 1:17:44.410
kill us on the way out.

1:17:44.452 --> 1:17:47.371
-All right. Yeah. [sniffs] -Okay?

1:18:18.277 --> 1:18:20.571
[laughter echoes]

1:20:44.298 --> 1:20:47.426
-Happy anniversary. -Happy anniversary.

1:20:52.931 --> 1:20:54.850
I'm gonna head in early today.

1:20:54.891 --> 1:20:57.144
-Rendezvous tonight? -Yeah.

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:09.114
[Mary into phone] Oh, hi, this is Mary Morrison.

1:21:09.156 --> 1:21:12.368
I'm calling about a check that I sent in a while ago,

1:21:12.409 --> 1:21:14.578
but it seems like it hasn't been deposited yet.

1:21:14.620 --> 1:21:16.288
[woman] Oh, hi, Mrs. Morrison,

1:21:16.330 --> 1:21:17.748
I've been meaning to call you.

1:21:17.790 --> 1:21:20.417
Yes, I have your check right here.

1:21:20.459 --> 1:21:22.252
I was just waiting to hear

1:21:22.294 --> 1:21:24.463
which caregiver you want to go with.

1:21:25.715 --> 1:21:26.965
What?

1:21:27.007 --> 1:21:29.051
I should have called you sooner,

1:21:29.092 --> 1:21:30.969
I'm sorry, we've been terribly busy.

1:21:32.221 --> 1:21:33.514
Um...

1:21:36.433 --> 1:21:38.435
[quietly] Grace.

1:21:38.477 --> 1:21:40.020
You have a Grace, right?

1:21:41.438 --> 1:21:43.982
Sorry, we don't have anybody by that name.

1:21:45.984 --> 1:21:47.069
Mary?

1:21:47.110 --> 1:21:49.655
Um, okay, thank you.

1:21:49.697 --> 1:21:52.032
Thank you so much. Thank you for letting me know

1:21:52.074 --> 1:21:55.369
that it will be deposited soon. Okay, bye-bye.

1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:59.331
I was thinking of changing the master bedroom sheets.

1:21:59.373 --> 1:22:01.250
Since it's your anniversary.

1:22:04.253 --> 1:22:05.880
Yes, of course.

1:22:05.921 --> 1:22:07.798
Grace, I--

1:22:09.091 --> 1:22:11.385
I just want to apologize about last night.

1:22:11.427 --> 1:22:14.889
I really don't know what came over me.

1:22:14.930 --> 1:22:16.932
I think I had a fever.

1:22:16.973 --> 1:22:18.601
I understand.

1:22:18.642 --> 1:22:21.520
Nightmares can feel so real sometimes.

1:22:31.655 --> 1:22:35.117
If this were a library, I would check it out.

1:22:35.158 --> 1:22:36.952
[Mary] Well, if you like that one,

1:22:36.993 --> 1:22:38.579
follow me.

1:22:54.010 --> 1:22:57.765
She's your best friend and you don't even know her last name?

1:22:57.807 --> 1:22:59.809
I do know a book she checked out recently

1:22:59.850 --> 1:23:02.812
is Laddie, by Gene Stratton-Porter.

1:23:02.853 --> 1:23:04.146
Ah.

1:23:04.187 --> 1:23:05.815
[typing]

1:23:11.487 --> 1:23:13.864
The only person to check out Laddie

1:23:13.906 --> 1:23:16.492
in the last three months.

1:23:16.533 --> 1:23:18.911
Elaine, please, please call me back,

1:23:18.953 --> 1:23:20.537
I need to talk to you.

1:23:21.747 --> 1:23:23.039
[sighs]

1:23:52.319 --> 1:23:54.112
[buzzes]

1:24:00.452 --> 1:24:02.078
[knocks] Elaine?

1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:03.580
[latch clicks]

1:24:05.624 --> 1:24:08.335
Oh! Thank God, here you are!

1:24:08.377 --> 1:24:09.628
I've been trying to call you!

1:24:09.670 --> 1:24:11.588
You would not believe-- [gasps]

1:24:21.139 --> 1:24:23.642
[gasps, screams]

1:24:23.684 --> 1:24:25.268
Oh, my God!

1:24:28.355 --> 1:24:30.357
[gasping]

1:24:32.902 --> 1:24:35.988
Ah! Oh! 911!

1:24:36.030 --> 1:24:37.781
Please hurry!

1:24:37.823 --> 1:24:40.158
Please come! Oh, my God!

1:24:51.962 --> 1:24:53.213
[distant sirens]

1:24:59.177 --> 1:25:01.179
[crying]

1:25:03.682 --> 1:25:05.851
Mrs. Morrison.

1:25:05.893 --> 1:25:07.978
Would you mind coming down to the station

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:09.145
to answer a few questions?

1:25:09.187 --> 1:25:11.815
Of course, whatever you need.

1:25:11.857 --> 1:25:14.359
Your husband's going to meet us there, okay?

1:25:14.401 --> 1:25:16.319
-Okay. -Okay.

1:25:32.502 --> 1:25:34.797
[officer] Pretty much an open and shut case.

1:25:37.132 --> 1:25:38.675
[officer #2 sighs]

1:25:40.510 --> 1:25:44.347
So... a writer, then.

1:25:44.389 --> 1:25:47.977
Mm-hmm, yes. Yes, I'm a writer. Um...

1:25:48.018 --> 1:25:50.938
Is my husband here yet? I'd really love to see him.

1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:52.689
He's on his way, Mrs. Morrison.

1:25:52.731 --> 1:25:54.399
In the meantime,

1:25:54.441 --> 1:25:56.944
you mind telling me what medications you're taking?

1:25:56.986 --> 1:25:59.613
Any kind of psychosis you may have been diagnosed with?

1:26:00.781 --> 1:26:02.032
Wh-What?

1:26:03.784 --> 1:26:04.868
What is this?

1:26:04.910 --> 1:26:06.662
We have footage of you, Mary.

1:26:06.703 --> 1:26:08.664
Early this morning, around 1:00 am,

1:26:08.705 --> 1:26:11.041
driving to the location of the deceased.

1:26:12.626 --> 1:26:14.294
That's not possible.

1:26:14.336 --> 1:26:16.922
And the deceased is my friend and her name is Elaine.

1:26:16.964 --> 1:26:19.091
We also have a witness, a neighbor of yours,

1:26:19.133 --> 1:26:21.468
saying you and Elaine were in some sort of argument

1:26:21.510 --> 1:26:23.219
yesterday evening outside your home.

1:26:23.261 --> 1:26:25.430
Do I need a lawyer present? Because I thought I was

1:26:25.472 --> 1:26:27.975
just coming here to help you with the investigation.

1:26:28.017 --> 1:26:30.686
And we have your fingerprints on the murder weapon.

1:26:30.727 --> 1:26:32.771
The scissors Elaine were stabbed with.

1:26:32.813 --> 1:26:34.648
That's just not possible.

1:26:35.858 --> 1:26:39.695
Mary, the evidence is all pointing one way.

1:26:39.736 --> 1:26:41.697
You either tell me something I don't know,

1:26:41.738 --> 1:26:43.406
or I'll lay it out for you.

1:27:01.216 --> 1:27:02.592
That could be anyone.

1:27:02.634 --> 1:27:04.761
We found this too, among your belongings

1:27:04.803 --> 1:27:06.346
hidden in your writer's room.

1:27:06.388 --> 1:27:08.765
Too many similarities between this made up story

1:27:08.807 --> 1:27:11.393
and the one going on in real life, wouldn't you say?

1:27:11.434 --> 1:27:13.520
No, this does not make sense!

1:27:13.562 --> 1:27:16.356
Anyone else have access to your work, Mrs. Morrison?

1:27:16.398 --> 1:27:19.026
Yes, of course, my publisher.

1:27:20.819 --> 1:27:23.321
-My husband. -You're so hot.

1:27:23.363 --> 1:27:25.448
Oh, and our nanny, Grace.

1:27:25.490 --> 1:27:28.577
[door opens] Mary, don't say another word.

1:27:31.121 --> 1:27:32.455
Oh, babe.

1:27:34.666 --> 1:27:36.877
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1:27:36.919 --> 1:27:39.088
It's all right, we're gonna figure this out.

1:27:39.129 --> 1:27:40.589
How is Rick doing?

1:27:41.673 --> 1:27:43.967
He's in shock.

1:27:44.009 --> 1:27:45.928
He doesn't think you did it, either.

1:27:47.971 --> 1:27:52.142
I don't understand how I'm the main suspect.

1:27:52.184 --> 1:27:54.603
Well, they don't have enough evidence to hold you.

1:27:54.644 --> 1:27:56.146
But what--

1:27:56.188 --> 1:27:58.398
What about the fingerprints on the scissors?

1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:01.068
Well, my fingerprints are on them, too.

1:28:01.110 --> 1:28:03.403
The kids' fingerprints are on the scissors.

1:28:04.404 --> 1:28:05.739
[sighs]

1:28:09.952 --> 1:28:11.245
Mary, where, um--

1:28:11.286 --> 1:28:13.496
Where-- Where were you last night?

1:28:14.873 --> 1:28:18.334
I-I got up to smoke...

1:28:18.376 --> 1:28:21.463
and then I saw that the light was on in my writer's room,

1:28:21.504 --> 1:28:22.965
so I went there to check.

1:28:23.006 --> 1:28:25.008
But nobody was there,

1:28:25.050 --> 1:28:28.720
and I locked it up and then I came back to bed.

1:28:32.766 --> 1:28:34.517
-You didn't go anywhere else? -Mm-mm.

1:28:34.559 --> 1:28:36.436
After you checked the house, you didn't--

1:28:36.478 --> 1:28:38.647
No. No, honey.

1:28:38.688 --> 1:28:41.024
You were gone for nearly three hours.

1:28:48.824 --> 1:28:50.909
Honey, really, I came right back to bed.

1:28:50.951 --> 1:28:52.619
You believe me, don't you?

1:28:55.413 --> 1:28:57.582
The slashed tires on the bike--

1:28:59.417 --> 1:29:01.920
They found a Swiss Army knife in the garage

1:29:01.962 --> 1:29:04.714
and the blade matches the markings on the bike tire.

1:29:04.756 --> 1:29:07.592
And yours are the only fingerprints on that knife.

1:29:12.139 --> 1:29:13.307
[clicks]

1:29:20.772 --> 1:29:22.357
When was the last time

1:29:22.398 --> 1:29:24.609
you were at Elaine's office for a session?

1:29:25.652 --> 1:29:27.112
Years ago.

1:29:28.655 --> 1:29:32.367
Well, they found some handwritten note that...

1:29:32.408 --> 1:29:33.785
seemed like a diagnosis,

1:29:33.827 --> 1:29:35.996
or that it outlined what you have.

1:29:36.038 --> 1:29:38.748
That is the time that I met her at the gym to work out.

1:29:38.790 --> 1:29:41.918
Those notes, they could be-- They could be about anyone.

1:29:44.213 --> 1:29:45.505
I know.

1:29:53.555 --> 1:29:56.892
[Grace, echoing] Who would do such a thing?

1:30:18.163 --> 1:30:19.413
Um...

1:30:21.041 --> 1:30:22.458
Uh...

1:30:22.500 --> 1:30:25.587
I've got to go to the restroom, okay?

1:30:29.966 --> 1:30:31.509
[footsteps fade]

1:30:39.559 --> 1:30:41.519
[tires squeal]

1:31:04.167 --> 1:31:06.211
[Tom] I told them you went home to rest.

1:31:06.253 --> 1:31:08.462
Really, I'm on my ass wanting to speak to you.

1:31:08.504 --> 1:31:10.048
Where are you?

1:31:15.387 --> 1:31:17.973
If you need something, if you're in trouble--

1:31:18.014 --> 1:31:19.391
I love you.

1:31:20.767 --> 1:31:22.894
[whispers] We can get you out.

1:31:22.936 --> 1:31:24.646
[normal voice] Meet you at home.

1:32:10.192 --> 1:32:11.525
[turns off engine]

1:32:17.991 --> 1:32:19.784
[dog barking]

1:32:21.286 --> 1:32:22.578
[sighs]

1:32:32.422 --> 1:32:34.216
[knocks]

1:32:34.257 --> 1:32:36.426
[woman] I'm not buying anything.

1:32:39.429 --> 1:32:41.806
There's no point in standing there.

1:32:41.848 --> 1:32:44.684
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not selling anything.

1:32:44.726 --> 1:32:46.769
I was just hoping I could talk to you.

1:32:46.811 --> 1:32:48.188
It's about Grace Taylor.

1:32:48.230 --> 1:32:50.899
[woman] Yeah? What about her?

1:32:50.940 --> 1:32:53.693
I'm her aunt.

1:32:53.735 --> 1:32:56.696
Oh, um, I just drove two hours to get here,

1:32:56.738 --> 1:32:58.823
would it be okay, I really need a restroom.

1:32:58.865 --> 1:33:00.075
Could I come in?

1:33:03.036 --> 1:33:04.037
Thank you so much.

1:33:04.079 --> 1:33:05.288
[woman] Through there.

1:33:05.330 --> 1:33:06.915
Okay, thank you.

1:33:25.725 --> 1:33:28.562
I don't know what she wants. Something about Grace.

1:33:28.602 --> 1:33:30.939
[deep voice] What the hell you let her in for,

1:33:30.980 --> 1:33:32.815
for heaven sakes!

1:33:35.026 --> 1:33:36.361
[door opens]

1:33:43.993 --> 1:33:46.955
I am so sorry that I just showed up like this.

1:33:46.996 --> 1:33:49.707
It's just that I'm Grace's employer.

1:33:49.749 --> 1:33:51.209
She looks after my children.

1:33:51.251 --> 1:33:53.044
I was hoping that maybe you could help

1:33:53.086 --> 1:33:54.963
answer a few questions about her?

1:33:58.007 --> 1:34:00.302
You're not from around here, are you?

1:34:01.844 --> 1:34:05.014
[deep voice groans] Christ.

1:34:05.056 --> 1:34:08.101
Here we go again.

1:34:08.143 --> 1:34:10.186
-[normal voice] Have a seat. -[Mary] Okay.

1:34:10.228 --> 1:34:11.854
[sighs]

1:34:13.982 --> 1:34:16.692
My Grace was one of the oldest.

1:34:16.734 --> 1:34:20.447
After her parents were sent to prison

1:34:20.489 --> 1:34:23.158
for nearly starving their children to death,

1:34:23.199 --> 1:34:26.578
and God knows whatever else they did to those kids,

1:34:26.620 --> 1:34:28.788
she came here to live with me.

1:34:31.124 --> 1:34:33.168
Last I heard, she got a job

1:34:33.209 --> 1:34:35.462
at one of those hoity-toity fitness clubs

1:34:35.504 --> 1:34:37.339
-in the city. -[dog whines]

1:34:37.380 --> 1:34:39.757
-[dog barks] -[deep voice] I said no!

1:34:39.799 --> 1:34:42.135
Idiot, get back in there!

1:34:42.177 --> 1:34:45.054
-Dumb dog! -[dog yelps]

1:34:45.096 --> 1:34:46.348
Christ!

1:34:47.557 --> 1:34:48.975
[metal scrapes]

1:34:56.441 --> 1:34:57.859
[dog whimpers]

1:34:57.900 --> 1:35:00.278
[normal voice] That's a good boy.

1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:02.738
-That's a good boy. -[dog whimpers]

1:35:02.780 --> 1:35:06.075
That's a good boy.

1:35:06.117 --> 1:35:08.786
[Grace] Ohh! That's a good boy.

1:35:10.955 --> 1:35:13.041
[laughter echoes]

1:35:15.627 --> 1:35:17.420
[Elaine] This could be the perfect thing

1:35:17.462 --> 1:35:19.088
to kick your ass out the door.

1:35:19.130 --> 1:35:22.467
Use it as momentum to enter into a new chapter

1:35:22.509 --> 1:35:24.302
and to do the things that you want to do,

1:35:24.344 --> 1:35:28.056
so you can create the things you want to create.

1:35:31.851 --> 1:35:33.353
... run errands, everything.

1:35:33.395 --> 1:35:34.854
I'm telling you, Mary, this is

1:35:34.896 --> 1:35:37.440
exactly what you need to get through.

1:35:45.156 --> 1:35:47.367
You have a lot going for you, Grace.

1:35:47.409 --> 1:35:48.784
Many talents.

1:35:48.826 --> 1:35:50.828
-[child cries] - Oh.

1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:03.508
â™ª FrÃ¨re Jacques, FrÃ¨re Jacques â™ª

1:36:03.550 --> 1:36:07.095
â™ª Dormez vous? Dormez vous? â™ª

1:36:07.136 --> 1:36:11.391
â™ª Sonnez les matines Sonnez les matines â™ª

1:36:11.433 --> 1:36:15.769
â™ª Ding, dong, ding Ding, dong, ding â™ª

1:36:15.811 --> 1:36:17.897
As I was saying...

1:36:17.939 --> 1:36:21.526
You are obviously a delightful and talented young woman.

1:36:21.568 --> 1:36:23.361
Unfortunately, we just aren't taking on

1:36:23.403 --> 1:36:25.280
any new caregivers at the moment.

1:36:25.321 --> 1:36:27.699
We'll be sure to keep you in mind for the future, though.

1:36:27.741 --> 1:36:29.117
I really need this job.

1:36:40.211 --> 1:36:41.463
What is it?

1:36:42.422 --> 1:36:44.006
I'm not fancy enough?

1:36:44.048 --> 1:36:46.175
Didn't go to the right schools?

1:36:46.217 --> 1:36:49.011
I'm overqualified compared to those brats!

1:36:49.053 --> 1:36:51.973
I'm sure you'll find a nice family who needs your help.

1:36:52.014 --> 1:36:53.558
Plenty of them exist.

1:36:54.850 --> 1:36:56.102
[echoing] Bitch.

1:37:04.068 --> 1:37:06.820
We'll be sure to keep you in mind for the future, though.

1:37:06.862 --> 1:37:08.990
Thank you for seeing me so soon.

1:37:09.031 --> 1:37:10.408
I really appreciate it.

1:37:10.450 --> 1:37:12.661
And if you need help with anything at all

1:37:12.702 --> 1:37:14.746
around the office, cleaning, whatever...

1:37:14.788 --> 1:37:16.872
[Angela] You're at the top of my list.

1:37:21.294 --> 1:37:23.421
[into phone] Tom, I'm on my way, okay?

1:37:23.463 --> 1:37:27.342
But whatever you do, do not let Grace into the house.

1:37:27.383 --> 1:37:30.470
I have reason to believe that she's really dangerous.

1:37:30.512 --> 1:37:33.598
So, whatever you do, please don't let Grace in.

1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:35.600
-[phone beeps call ended] -Tom?

1:37:35.642 --> 1:37:37.977

1:37:38.019 --> 1:37:42.106
[Elaine] After it's over,

1:37:38.019 --> 1:37:42.106
you go back to normal, right?

1:37:42.148 --> 1:37:45.026
[Mary, distorted] But I turn into a different person...

1:37:46.027 --> 1:37:47.403
[water running]

1:38:09.342 --> 1:38:10.926
[video game sounds]

1:38:59.851 --> 1:39:01.143
[water stops]

1:39:02.812 --> 1:39:05.022
[Tom] Hey, babe, is that you?

1:39:10.403 --> 1:39:12.655
Yep, it's me.

1:39:16.618 --> 1:39:19.287
I thought we could use a little playtime.

1:39:23.917 --> 1:39:25.585
Grace, I already told you,

1:39:25.627 --> 1:39:28.421
I don't want to play these games with you anymore.

1:39:28.463 --> 1:39:31.382
You told me you loved games.

1:39:31.424 --> 1:39:34.302
All men love games. [chuckles]

1:39:34.343 --> 1:39:37.012
You've been a terrible boy, Tom.

1:39:38.431 --> 1:39:40.308
And it's time for you to pay.

1:39:41.601 --> 1:39:43.937
Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

1:39:45.521 --> 1:39:47.774
-Now, you listen-- -No, you listen!

1:39:47.816 --> 1:39:49.651
You will do exactly as I say

1:39:49.692 --> 1:39:51.110
or suffer the consequences.

1:39:51.152 --> 1:39:52.445
What are you talking about?

1:39:52.487 --> 1:39:54.238
Are you crazy? Are you fucking insane?!

1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:56.073
[chuckles]

1:39:56.115 --> 1:39:58.701
One thing you should know about me, Tom,

1:39:58.743 --> 1:40:01.370
is I'm completely insane.

1:40:01.412 --> 1:40:03.539
And I always get what I want.

1:40:08.461 --> 1:40:09.921
[flower pot shatters]

1:40:09.963 --> 1:40:12.423
I don't want to have to hurt you, but I will.

1:40:12.465 --> 1:40:14.175
[laughs]

1:40:14.216 --> 1:40:15.969
You hurt me?

1:40:16.009 --> 1:40:17.971
That's hilarious.

1:40:18.011 --> 1:40:19.681
-Uh! -Oh!

[Grace] Ha, see?

1:40:39.492 --> 1:40:41.577
[breathing heavily] I told you,

1:40:41.619 --> 1:40:43.746
I always get what I want.

1:41:04.141 --> 1:41:05.601
Honey?

1:41:05.643 --> 1:41:06.853
[Tom weakly] Mary...

1:41:06.895 --> 1:41:08.312
Here!

1:41:08.354 --> 1:41:09.939
Coming!

1:41:12.692 --> 1:41:14.694
[gasping]

1:41:19.615 --> 1:41:20.825
Kids?

1:41:22.368 --> 1:41:23.578
Kids?

1:41:25.580 --> 1:41:27.164
Tom, where are you?

1:41:27.206 --> 1:41:28.541
[Grace] Oh, Mary!

1:41:28.583 --> 1:41:29.876
-I'm so glad you're here! -Grace!

1:41:29.918 --> 1:41:31.335
Where are the twins? Where's Tom?

1:41:31.377 --> 1:41:33.796
The twins are in the game room, safe.

1:41:33.838 --> 1:41:35.297
Tom has...

1:41:35.339 --> 1:41:37.425
Oh, No-no-no-no! Don't go in there!

1:41:37.466 --> 1:41:38.718
It-It's a mess.

1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:40.762
-I'll get some things-- -Tom?!

1:41:40.803 --> 1:41:43.264
-[Mary] Tom! -[Grace] I'll clean it!

1:41:43.305 --> 1:41:44.724
Where are you?

1:41:44.766 --> 1:41:46.935
-Here... in here. -[Mary] Tom!

1:41:46.976 --> 1:41:49.186
[Tom gasping] I'm in...

1:41:49.228 --> 1:41:51.313
-I'm in here. -Oh, my God!

1:41:52.356 --> 1:41:54.149
Oh, my God! What happened?!

1:41:54.191 --> 1:41:56.819
I-- I didn't mean to-- I never wanted to--

1:41:56.861 --> 1:41:59.030
-Honey, don't talk. -You gotta believe me--

1:41:59.072 --> 1:42:00.113
I do!

1:42:00.155 --> 1:42:02.283
She sedu-- seduced me!

1:42:02.324 --> 1:42:04.243
-[Mary] It's all right. -I never want--

1:42:04.285 --> 1:42:07.288
Okay, okay, I believe you, please, don't talk.

1:42:07.329 --> 1:42:09.540
Just hang in there, okay?

1:42:09.582 --> 1:42:11.375
[gasping]

1:42:11.417 --> 1:42:14.211
Oh! I'm-I'm so sorry for the mess!

1:42:17.090 --> 1:42:19.425
Grace! Grace!

1:42:19.467 --> 1:42:23.638
I need you to call 911 right now! Right now!

1:42:23.679 --> 1:42:25.723
[breathing heavily] Okay. Right, right, right!

1:42:25.765 --> 1:42:27.308
Um...

1:42:29.184 --> 1:42:31.479
Hello? Yes, um--

1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:32.897
We need an ambulance.

1:42:32.939 --> 1:42:35.066
[hysterical] Yes, um, there's a man

1:42:35.108 --> 1:42:37.026
and he's-he's-- he's dying!

1:42:37.068 --> 1:42:39.654
And he's gonna bleed to death if you don't come soon.

1:42:47.328 --> 1:42:50.123
[crying] I don't know.

1:42:52.834 --> 1:42:54.502
I tried to stop her!

1:42:54.543 --> 1:42:56.671
I told her you were nice people

1:42:56.712 --> 1:42:58.756
-and you could help us. -[weakly] Honey...

1:42:58.798 --> 1:43:00.549
You tried to stop who?

Me, you cunt!

1:43:10.893 --> 1:43:12.645
Margaret.

1:43:15.481 --> 1:43:17.025
Kill her, bitch!

1:43:17.066 --> 1:43:19.152
[Grace] I don't want to! Please!

1:43:19.192 --> 1:43:20.402

1:43:21.779 --> 1:43:23.656
[Margaret] You have to kill her!

1:43:23.698 --> 1:43:26.534
She betrayed you. She doesn't love you.

1:43:26.575 --> 1:43:28.494
[Grace] Yes, yes, she does.

1:43:28.536 --> 1:43:30.371
She does love me! She does!

1:43:30.412 --> 1:43:33.166
You love me, Mary, right?

Too bad, so sad. [chuckles]

1:44:57.875 --> 1:45:01.003
And Grace was actually starting to like you.

1:45:01.045 --> 1:45:03.089
Thought she could get rid of me.

1:45:03.131 --> 1:45:04.882
Replace me with you.

1:45:04.924 --> 1:45:06.299
[Grace] I did get rid of you!

1:45:09.804 --> 1:45:12.305
Now, we know that can never happen now, don't we?

1:45:12.347 --> 1:45:15.017
[Margaret] How would we ever get along in this world

1:45:15.059 --> 1:45:16.978
if it weren't for me?

1:45:34.453 --> 1:45:35.913
Let's play our game?

1:45:35.955 --> 1:45:37.832
Not now, Adam.

Come on, please?

1:45:44.172 --> 1:45:45.881
[Adam] You be Margaret.

1:45:47.967 --> 1:45:49.593
[Margaret] I'm the survivor.

1:45:49.635 --> 1:45:52.180
I'm the one who got us through hell!

1:45:52.221 --> 1:45:54.598
And this whore just thinks she can

1:45:54.640 --> 1:45:57.268
waltz right in and replace me? [laughs]

1:45:57.310 --> 1:45:59.020
Because of love?

Until there is nothing left of you!

1:46:16.996 --> 1:46:18.497
[Grace] That's not true!

1:46:18.539 --> 1:46:21.083
[in head] We have to make her go away, Grace!

1:46:21.125 --> 1:46:22.668

Please don't give up on me.

I won't.

1:48:09.984 --> 1:48:12.527
Actually, no, I'm doing something different

1:48:12.569 --> 1:48:14.947
that I've been wanting to do for a long time.

1:48:16.198 --> 1:48:17.408
Bye.

1:48:18.451 --> 1:48:19.660
Bye.

1:48:25.207 --> 1:48:26.583
[Mary] I did it.

1:48:29.170 --> 1:48:32.256
All I needed was to get my ass kicked out the door.

1:48:34.049 --> 1:48:35.343
It's all for you.
