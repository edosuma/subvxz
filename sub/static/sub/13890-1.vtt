01:07.805 --> 01:10.325
It's got to be in the middle,
the middle, you metal moron.

01:10.365 --> 01:13.605
Look, this is my Vending Machine
Maintenance Man Of The Month

01:13.645 --> 01:17.505
certificate we are reframing here,
my one and only Mr April.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.365
There's no room for sloppiness.

01:19.405 --> 01:22.375
And take that look
off your face for a start.

01:30.044 --> 01:31.564
Where's Kryten? I need him.

01:31.604 --> 01:33.504
He's on holiday.

01:33.504 --> 01:36.004
–Holiday?
–Yeah. A week off, no duties.

01:36.044 --> 01:39.284
I thought he needed it.
–Lister, Kryten is a mechanoid, a machine.

01:39.324 --> 01:41.424
Machines don't go on holiday.

01:41.424 --> 01:44.024
Who's next? The egg whisk?
Two weeks in Mauritius?

01:44.064 --> 01:46.804
Booked him and your electric
toothbrush a double room?

01:46.844 --> 01:49.204
–He was tired.
–Tired?

01:49.204 --> 01:51.384
What was it? Metal fatigue?

01:51.384 --> 01:53.044
Holiday!

01:53.044 --> 01:55.124
Where's he gone?

01:55.124 --> 01:57.264
Broom cupboard on V deck.

01:57.264 --> 02:02.264
–Really nice shelf.
–V deck? Why not B deck or C deck,
somewhere close?

02:02.264 --> 02:05.364
He wanted to travel.
Didn't you read his postcard?

02:05.404 --> 02:07.764
He's loving it. Taken his feet off,

02:07.764 --> 02:09.304
unscrewed his head,

02:09.304 --> 02:12.324
eyes bobbing about
in a bowl of lens cleaner.

02:12.324 --> 02:14.502
He's having the time of his life.

02:24.124 --> 02:25.644
Tomatoes?

02:25.644 --> 02:27.304
Supply decks.

02:27.304 --> 02:30.224
200 floors.
It took me ages to get these.

02:30.224 --> 02:33.744
I smegging hate tomatoes—
taste, texture, ugh.

02:38.624 --> 02:41.684
Don't know why
I put myself through it.

02:41.684 --> 02:46.684
Lister, why do you eat tomatoes
when you don't like them? There's
plenty of other things to eat.

02:46.724 --> 02:48.764
It's got to be tomatoes, man.

02:48.764 --> 02:50.546
Only thing I'm allergic to.

02:52.064 --> 02:54.484
Why do you want to eat something
you're allergic to?

02:54.524 --> 02:59.524
According to the read-outs,
we're down to our last water tank.
Only G deck left. I'm saving water.

02:59.564 --> 03:03.744
Have you ever been down to G deck?
Seen the water tank?
There's loads of water left.

03:03.784 --> 03:07.612
So how come only a trickle's
coming out of the taps, then?

03:09.324 --> 03:12.404
How does eating tomatoes save water?

03:12.404 --> 03:13.864
It's coming.

03:19.064 --> 03:22.564
Don't suppose you want
any ironing doing, do you?

03:23.724 --> 03:25.764
I get it.

03:25.764 --> 03:27.784
I get it.

03:27.784 --> 03:30.984
I love it when it makes
that squish sound, don't you?

03:31.024 --> 03:33.684
You've spent hours
planning this, haven't you?

03:33.724 --> 03:36.604
Hours, this wind-up.

03:36.604 --> 03:38.404
Because that's exactly what it is.

03:38.444 --> 03:43.344
Going down to the supply decks,
trawling through the crates,
getting half hysterical

03:43.384 --> 03:47.124
at the thought of my face
as you start to iron your sneezes.

03:47.164 --> 03:49.364
Was it really worth it, Listy?

03:49.364 --> 03:54.424
Hours and hours and hours of planning
for eight seconds of pleasure?

03:54.424 --> 03:57.384
Sounds like the last time
you had sex.

03:58.484 --> 04:01.504
Lister, you need to get a life.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.204
Level.

04:14.204 --> 04:15.564
Level.

04:18.644 --> 04:20.184
Level.

04:21.224 --> 04:22.464
Level.

04:22.464 --> 04:25.224
Close.

04:30.844 --> 04:33.364
Not level.

05:15.944 --> 05:18.464
I thought I'd read you another book.

05:18.464 --> 05:22.028
It's one of those stupid ones
you used to really like.

05:22.924 --> 05:25.844
Jane Oostin?

05:25.844 --> 05:27.524
Austin?

05:27.524 --> 05:29.504
Orsdon?

05:29.504 --> 05:32.144
I'm not quite sure
how you pronounce it.

05:33.164 --> 05:35.084
Sense And Sensibility.

05:37.144 --> 05:40.312
Pray to God there's some
car chases in this one.

05:43.684 --> 05:48.384
“The family of Dashwood had
long been settled in Sussex.”

05:58.644 --> 06:00.404
Ow!

06:02.324 --> 06:04.204
What happened to you?

06:04.204 --> 06:05.884
You got a minute?

06:09.964 --> 06:11.864
Tell him.

06:11.864 --> 06:16.364
I'm walking through the cargo deck,
right, minding my own damn business

06:16.404 --> 06:19.344
when all of a sudden…
You know that big tank on G deck?

06:19.384 --> 06:21.504
He means the water tank.

06:21.504 --> 06:26.364
Suddenly there's a disturbance
on the surface of the tank and…

06:27.684 --> 06:29.564
whoosh…

06:29.564 --> 06:33.444
this massive testicle
shoots up out of the water
and grabs me by the throat.

06:33.484 --> 06:36.124
–He means “tentacle”.
–I hope so.

06:36.124 --> 06:41.864
Before I know it,
I'm flying through the air,
being waved about from side to side.

06:41.864 --> 06:45.644
I'm shouting, I'm screaming,
because this thing, whatever it is,

06:45.684 --> 06:47.884
is absolutely ruining my hair.

06:47.884 --> 06:53.064
Next thing I know,
it pulls me down into the icy waters
and I'm shouting and screaming again

06:53.104 --> 06:57.184
because everything I'm wearing
is Dry Clean Only.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.204
Suddenly, I'm staring
at this big eye.

07:00.204 --> 07:02.644
It's about THIS big.

07:02.644 --> 07:05.164
No, this big.

07:05.164 --> 07:07.744
No, this big. Man, it was just…

07:07.744 --> 07:10.404
Oh, what's the right word?

07:10.404 --> 07:12.724
–Big?
–Exactly.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.390
And then the beast —because that's
what it is— opens its mouth

07:16.430 --> 07:19.724
and I realised that's
where I'm heading.

07:19.724 --> 07:26.852
So I combed my hair and fainted.
Came to, I'm on the floor by the side
of the tank, no sign of the creature.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.444
Ooh, I need counselling.

07:31.444 --> 07:33.204
You've got that right.

07:33.204 --> 07:35.124
So where did it go?

07:35.124 --> 07:37.904
It didn't say,
and it didn't leave a note.

07:37.904 --> 07:40.124
–This is so weird.
–It's not THAT weird.

07:40.164 --> 07:42.024
Probably can't even write.

07:42.024 --> 07:44.844
How'd it even hold a pen
with its big testicle?

07:44.884 --> 07:48.764
–It's slithered back
into the water tank, hasn't it?
–But a sea monster?

07:48.804 --> 07:51.244
In the water tank? That's not right.

07:51.244 --> 07:53.324
We're in deep space.

07:53.324 --> 07:57.484
♫ Holiday, celebrate, holiday… ♫

07:57.484 --> 08:01.464
Hey!
Surf boy is back from Broomtown.

08:01.464 --> 08:03.484
What a vacation, sirs.

08:03.484 --> 08:07.584
I can't remember the last time
I was so relaxed and utterly carefree.

08:07.624 --> 08:10.384
–There's a big monster in the water tank.
–Oh, my gosh!

08:10.424 --> 08:13.104
–That's why we're down on water.
–We're down on water?

08:13.144 --> 08:16.524
Yeah, and without water, me
and the Cat are going to die. Yeah.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.224
It's a disaster! Oh, my back!

08:19.224 --> 08:22.924
I'm one giant tension knot.
Someone pummel my diodes.

08:22.924 --> 08:28.504
Hey, this thing, whatever it is,
it's messing with the supply
thingy pipe stuff thing, isn't it?

08:28.544 --> 08:31.244
Please, we're laymen.
Spare us the plumbing jargon.

08:31.284 --> 08:35.124
The point is, we've got
to get in there and whack it.
Fritter the critter.

08:35.164 --> 08:37.583
Kill it⁈ No way!

08:37.583 --> 08:41.563
We should capture this sucker, force
it to pay my dry-cleaning bills.

08:41.604 --> 08:46.024
The point is, how DO we kill it?
We can't suck it out of an
air lock. We'll lose the water.

08:46.064 --> 08:50.124
We can't mickey the water.
We'd pollute the drinking supply.

08:50.124 --> 08:52.104
No choice.

08:52.104 --> 08:54.304
We're going to have to go in,
get it.

08:54.344 --> 08:56.904
–Serious?
–We're going to need a diving bell,

08:56.944 --> 08:59.644
the kind with grade-one
reinforced titanium ribs.

08:59.684 --> 09:04.324
We're going to need diving suits,
bazookoids, mini-grenades,
laser-lancer, blasters.

09:04.364 --> 09:08.304
And we're going to need
something good for me to read
while you're all down there.

09:08.344 --> 09:11.704
Classic Car Monthly or something.
–You're not coming down with us?

09:11.744 --> 09:13.904
In spirit,
I'll be down there with you.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.224
In actuality,
I'll be reading a car mag.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.924
Well, I'd better
start packing, then.

09:18.924 --> 09:21.344
Oh, I already AM packed!

09:22.724 --> 09:25.324
Don't look at me, I ain't going.

09:25.324 --> 09:27.684
I'm still in trauma. Look at my suit.

09:27.724 --> 09:29.544
It may not pull through.

09:29.544 --> 09:31.804
Find another suit. You're going.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.524
Hey, I'm a cat.

09:33.524 --> 09:35.884
Nobody bosses Mr C around, buddy.

09:35.884 --> 09:38.024
You got that, monkey boy?

09:38.024 --> 09:42.804
Or should I explain it one more time
for your small monkey brain?

09:42.804 --> 09:44.624
How would you like it…

09:44.624 --> 09:51.124
if I flushed the entire ship's
supply of tuna out of an airlock?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.844
When are we leaving? You packed?

09:53.844 --> 09:55.344
Come on, let me help you, man.

09:55.384 --> 09:57.404
Come on, get going.
We go in two minutes.

09:57.444 --> 09:59.264
Two minutes? Two minutes?

09:59.264 --> 10:02.624
I need to make myself
look sensational.

10:02.624 --> 10:06.724
Make it three. And don't wear
nothing lilac or we'll clash!

10:06.724 --> 10:08.964
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Ow-ee!

10:18.337 --> 10:20.449
We're hitting the water, Rimmer.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.417
What? Oh, yeah.

10:26.157 --> 10:29.557
–Hey, there's something out there.
–Where? I saw something moving.

10:29.597 --> 10:33.257
My bowels, if you keep
shouting like that. Oh.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.797
It's gone. It's gone.

10:37.677 --> 10:39.717
Rimmer, check the sonar.

10:39.717 --> 10:45.497
Did you know that of all the Jensen
Interceptors ever built, only 23
have the manual four-speed box?

10:45.537 --> 10:47.877
It's amazing.
–<i>Rimmer, the sonar!</i>

10:47.917 --> 10:51.217
<i>Check it, you smegger!</i>
Is there anything down here with us?

10:51.257 --> 10:52.897
<i>What? No.</i>

10:52.897 --> 10:54.897
<i>It's all clear, it's fine, good.</i>

10:54.937 --> 10:59.857
<i>Get this, listen. “The four-wheel
drive, the FF, identified by a measly</i>

10:59.897 --> 11:04.457
“four-inch stretch in the wheelbase,
had ABS in 1966.” How mad is that?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.037
I saw something! I saw something.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.819
I definitely saw something.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.577
<i>Oops.</i>

11:17.577 --> 11:20.417
Er, chaps… bit of an update.

11:20.417 --> 11:24.537
There appears to be something bigger
than God heading straight for you.

11:24.577 --> 11:26.081
–What is it?
–How do I know?

11:26.121 --> 11:29.177
It's not like a commercial airliner
with writing down the side.

11:29.217 --> 11:31.577
Well, do something.
Get us out of here.

11:31.617 --> 11:33.217
Can't. Too scared.

11:33.217 --> 11:35.297
Can't. Look at my hands.

11:35.297 --> 11:38.877
YOU'RE scared? But you're
not even down here. You're safe.

11:38.917 --> 11:43.197
Safe? I'm not safe from having to
sit here and watch my sonar screen

11:43.237 --> 11:45.517
get covered in your
gloopy insides, am I?

11:45.557 --> 11:48.677
<i>I'm not safe from seeing
those terrible pictures in my head</i>

11:48.717 --> 11:51.397
<i>of you being eaten alive and never
being able to get rid of them.</i>

11:51.437 --> 11:54.757
<i>You just think about you, don't
you? It's always you with you!</i>

11:54.797 --> 11:58.617
Sir, I've changed my eyeballs three
times and I can't see anything.

11:58.657 --> 12:01.177
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.237
Gone.

12:06.237 --> 12:08.897
<i>It must have been
a speck on the sonar.</i>

12:08.937 --> 12:11.897
Relax. As you were.

12:22.377 --> 12:23.377
Oh, my God.

12:45.577 --> 12:46.617
What was that?

12:46.617 --> 12:48.777
It's gone!

12:48.777 --> 12:50.317
No, sir.

12:50.317 --> 12:55.577
It's underneath us. If we're really
quiet, it might think we're a rock.

12:59.037 --> 13:05.597
(Rimmer, pull us up,
slowly and quietly.)

13:11.117 --> 13:15.657
(Rimmer, are… you…
rea… ding… me⁈)

13:18.417 --> 13:22.957
(Sir, can… you… hear… us⁈)

13:24.617 --> 13:26.577
Wait, what's that?

13:27.797 --> 13:29.183
I can't see anything!

13:36.397 --> 13:38.537
Will you keep the noise down
back there?

13:38.577 --> 13:40.953
Can't you see I'm looking for squid?

13:45.017 --> 13:46.857
I still can't see it…

13:57.317 --> 13:59.797
Sir, may I make one tiny suggestion?

13:59.797 --> 14:04.037
Releasing a firearm
in a confined titanium steel box

14:04.037 --> 14:06.677
may not be a good mix
with human tissue.

14:22.097 --> 14:23.657
Oh, my God!

14:25.357 --> 14:27.417
Hang on,
I'm getting you out of there.

14:27.457 --> 14:29.717
Rimmer to the rescue, as per usual.

14:29.757 --> 14:32.257
What would these
clowns do without me, eh?

14:32.297 --> 14:35.777
Anyone else would probably get a
medal for this, the Eagle of Valour,

14:35.817 --> 14:37.657
the Space Knight's Cross of Honour.

14:37.697 --> 14:40.073
I bet I don't even get a book token.

14:54.157 --> 14:56.917
Two suits in one day, look at me!
Thanks to you,

14:56.957 --> 14:59.477
I couldn't even get on
the cover of Minger Monthly!

14:59.517 --> 15:03.517
You're supposed to be
manning the sonar, Rimmer!

15:03.517 --> 15:05.937
You could have got us all killed!

15:06.857 --> 15:08.677
Is this about you again?

15:08.677 --> 15:12.097
It is, isn't it? Can't you see,
right now I need some me time?

15:12.137 --> 15:13.897
My heart is still hammering.

15:13.937 --> 15:16.697
I don't know how I got through that!
–You wasn't even there!

15:16.737 --> 15:18.677
I was NEARLY there.

15:19.937 --> 15:21.719
That's close enough for me.

15:24.577 --> 15:26.397
What the hell was that thing?

15:26.437 --> 15:29.557
Well, some kind of
dimension-migrating leviathan

15:29.597 --> 15:32.437
looking for somewhere quiet
to hibernate.

15:32.437 --> 15:34.637
Where better than
the middle of deep space

15:34.677 --> 15:37.497
in a universe where the
human race is virtually extinct?

15:37.537 --> 15:38.897
It's extraordinary.

15:42.537 --> 15:45.237
–It's gone!
–Where?
–I don't know.

15:45.237 --> 15:49.417
Probably to another dimension
to lick its… Wait! Incoming!

15:49.417 --> 15:50.457
What's this?

15:53.697 --> 15:54.737
Hmm!

15:54.737 --> 15:55.793
I bid greetings.

15:56.777 --> 15:59.677
My name is Katerina Bartikovsky.

15:59.677 --> 16:02.497
In past, I Red Dwarf's
science officer. Zdravstvuyte!

16:02.537 --> 16:05.557
From now, I am senior officer.

16:05.557 --> 16:08.677
No longer hologram Arnold Rimmer
who is bit crap.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.637
What?

16:12.377 --> 16:14.817
Look, sir. Confirmed.

16:14.817 --> 16:19.677
Adjustment on command structure
essential if one day Lister
to regenerate human race, huh?

16:19.717 --> 16:21.417
Result!

16:21.417 --> 16:23.217
You beauty!

16:29.877 --> 16:32.597
Why does mainframe
computer not function?

16:32.597 --> 16:35.517
Lister left a bath running
in the officers' quarters.

16:35.557 --> 16:38.117
We didn't find out about it
for nearly nine years.

16:38.157 --> 16:41.877
Then one night, it was a Tuesday,
the floor gave way

16:41.877 --> 16:45.137
and nearly two million gallons
of water fell through the ship.

16:45.177 --> 16:46.557
Not a nice way to be woken.

16:46.597 --> 16:48.517
One minute you're lying
in bed snoozing,

16:48.557 --> 16:51.597
the next you're being washed down
a corridor at 80 knots per hour.

16:51.637 --> 16:55.003
The skutters still haven't
finished drying him out.

16:55.897 --> 16:57.757
Have skutters more pressing duties?

16:57.797 --> 17:00.577
Duties that distract
them from these tasks?

17:00.617 --> 17:02.437
Is this you?
–No.

17:02.437 --> 17:03.417
Urgh.

17:04.497 --> 17:05.537
The place is a mess.

17:05.577 --> 17:08.017
What has mech been doing?
–Kryten?

17:08.017 --> 17:10.377
Holiday. Nice shelf on V deck.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.617
My idea. Needed break.

17:12.617 --> 17:14.797
Mechs don't go on holiday.

17:14.797 --> 17:16.997
They are machines.
–That's what I said.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.997
You were senior officer. It was
duty to ensure efficiency of ship.

17:21.037 --> 17:24.737
How come there are two
holograms active, both hard light?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.916
I thought the ship
could only sustain one.

17:26.957 --> 17:31.217
–How does Lister pass time?
–Sleeps, annoys me.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.757
Look, if there's one…

17:32.757 --> 17:36.497
Besides sleeping and annoying you,
what else he do?

17:36.497 --> 17:37.857
Gets ready for bed.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.077
And for entertainment?

17:40.077 --> 17:42.017
He irons sneezes.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.057
In fact, if he was an art student,

17:44.097 --> 17:46.457
he'd probably be considered
a genius.

17:46.497 --> 17:48.617
Is tragedy.

17:48.617 --> 17:52.017
His body lives but inside he is dead.

17:52.017 --> 17:54.737
This is your fault. You killed him.

17:54.737 --> 17:56.277
What did I do?

17:56.277 --> 18:00.417
You responsible for his life but you
do nothing. You think only of you.

18:00.457 --> 18:04.557
I don't know whether you happened
to notice, but we are in deep space,

18:04.597 --> 18:07.557
where there isn't a whole
hell of a lot to do.

18:07.597 --> 18:10.997
There are only so many times
you can play What's In The Bag?

18:11.037 --> 18:14.117
Fish paste? Lister's trainers?

18:14.117 --> 18:18.077
In my country, we have word
for people like you.

18:18.077 --> 18:20.257
In my country, we have several.

18:22.337 --> 18:24.057
Hey. I've found one.

18:25.297 --> 18:26.877
Mr Lister, please prepare.

18:26.917 --> 18:31.735
You are to be returning home, so we
have possibility to make this happen.

18:32.617 --> 18:33.617
Are you serious?

18:33.657 --> 18:35.657
Of course, I always serious.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.717
Mr Rimmer?
–Yes.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.197
You have 24 hours
to get your affairs in order,

18:40.237 --> 18:42.777
then you'll be offlined
and your data files erased.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.517
Then your hard drive
will be fired into space

18:45.557 --> 18:49.847
and when safe distance from ship,
be detonated by nuclear fusion.

18:50.237 --> 18:52.937
–You really don't like me, do you?
–I do my job.

18:52.977 --> 18:54.997
And my job is look after him.

18:54.997 --> 18:58.017
Which, sadly, is very
ungroovy news for you, you see?

18:58.057 --> 19:00.137
Dobry vecher.

19:07.297 --> 19:08.937
I hate her.

19:08.937 --> 19:10.577
I like her.

19:10.577 --> 19:12.277
I like her a lot!

19:16.117 --> 19:18.817
She's given me 24 hours
to get my affairs in order

19:18.857 --> 19:20.797
before I'm offlined and trashed.

19:20.837 --> 19:22.917
She's treated me
like a computer virus.

19:22.957 --> 19:27.445
Oh, she's so bright and perceptive,
sir. Such a breath of fresh air.

19:27.657 --> 19:29.277
We all have our Achilles heel.

19:29.317 --> 19:32.117
Find hers.
Start trawling the data, Kryty.

19:32.117 --> 19:35.537
Get me some dirt on her. You
know what I'm talking about, kid?

19:35.577 --> 19:37.317
Ah, Ms Bartikovsky!

19:37.317 --> 19:40.117
Yes, Miss Smegging Bartikovsky.
Get me some dirt on her.

19:40.157 --> 19:43.737
Er, I trust you slept well, Ms…

19:43.737 --> 19:45.757
Not particularly, “Mzz!”

19:45.757 --> 19:47.777
I love it when your voice unit
acts up!

19:47.817 --> 19:50.377
“Mzz, hrr, hrr!”
Right, back to the dirt thing…

19:50.417 --> 19:54.617
Your breasts look
particularly good today, Ms!

19:54.617 --> 19:57.097
My what? My bre… What are you…?

19:58.457 --> 20:00.517
Good morning, Mzz… Miss!

20:00.517 --> 20:01.977
You, follow me.

20:05.017 --> 20:06.577
On my way to Dirtville, sir.

20:06.617 --> 20:08.057
I'll catch you later.

20:09.217 --> 20:11.131
Engage Innocent Whistle Mode.

20:12.957 --> 20:15.957
So, as spoken,
I bring Lister back to life,

20:15.957 --> 20:19.177
restore drive so can
restart human race, yes?

20:19.177 --> 20:23.897
And how, pray tell,
do you plan to do that?

20:23.897 --> 20:26.097
Isn't obvious?

20:26.097 --> 20:28.037
You start, I'll join in.

20:28.037 --> 20:31.637
Well, the solution is staring you
in your stupid, fat, ferrety face.

20:31.677 --> 20:34.677
We have tentacle of
dimension-migrating leviathan.

20:34.717 --> 20:37.957
We take, insert into gene reader—
you have several in medi-lab—

20:37.997 --> 20:40.557
and triangulate results with
power surge readings

20:40.597 --> 20:43.777
and temporal displacement residues
recorded in water tank.

20:43.817 --> 20:47.857
We then calculate quantum
algorithm creature produced
to open dimensional membrane,

20:47.897 --> 20:49.237
then we travel multiverse.

20:49.277 --> 20:51.597
Once computed, we have key
to dimensional travel,

20:51.637 --> 20:56.037
transpose calibrations into mining
laser and, bingo jingo, we have
very own dimension cutter.

20:56.077 --> 20:59.077
That is exactly
what I was going to say!

20:59.077 --> 21:02.117
That's so spooky!
–So, Lister will travel to new dimension,

21:02.157 --> 21:04.557
bring back mate,
recreate human race, yes?

21:04.597 --> 21:08.717
Word for word
what I was gonna say!

21:57.397 --> 22:01.877
No way'll this work. I'll
probably end up with your head,
or someone else's legs.

22:01.917 --> 22:05.745
Something always goes wrong,
I'm not building my hopes up.

22:07.777 --> 22:09.717
And we begin.

22:21.017 --> 22:22.457
♫ It's cold outside

22:22.457 --> 22:24.017
♫ There's no kind of atmosphere

22:24.057 --> 22:27.537
♫ I'm all alone, more or less

22:27.537 --> 22:30.617
♫ Let me fly far away from here

22:30.617 --> 22:33.657
♫ Fun, fun, fun

22:33.657 --> 22:37.417
♫ In the sun, sun, sun

22:37.417 --> 22:39.057
♫ I want to lie

22:39.057 --> 22:40.577
♫ Shipwrecked and comatose

22:40.617 --> 22:44.057
♫ Drinking fresh mango juice

22:44.057 --> 22:47.697
♫ Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

22:47.697 --> 22:50.377
♫ Fun, fun, fun

22:50.377 --> 22:54.177
♫ In the sun, sun, sun

22:54.177 --> 22:57.137
♫ Fun, fun, fun

22:57.137 --> 23:00.937
♫ In the sun, sun, sun. ♫

23:02.177 --> 23:05.177
