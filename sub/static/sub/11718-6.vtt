Let me help you out
with that right hand.

00:22.073 --> 00:23.473
You know how to do this?

00:23.540 --> 00:27.036
Yeah, did Muay Thai,
little jiujitsu.

00:27.104 --> 00:28.634
Really?

00:29.970 --> 00:31.269
Yeah.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.871
Used to spar
with my ex-boyfriend.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.035
It was kind of fun
until I started beating him.

00:35.086 --> 00:37.204
Oh. Maybe you should be
going out

00:37.255 --> 00:39.256
into that ring instead of me.

00:39.324 --> 00:40.874
It's not too late

you paying me a compliment?

this is Steve McGarrett.

Nice to meet you, sailor.

- Nice to meet you. NCIS, huh?
- Yup.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.160

between Governor Jameson,

04:23.064 --> 04:25.098
Wo Fat and your father

04:25.149 --> 04:27.300
was recorded by a surveillance
camera in Governor Jameson's

04:27.401 --> 04:28.935
office over a year ago.

04:28.986 --> 04:32.189
Only you have no idea what he's
saying because the audio sucks.

04:32.256 --> 04:33.323
What she means is,

04:33.407 --> 04:35.826
that the audio file
is unrecoverable.

04:35.910 --> 04:37.944
I flew Agent Blye

04:45.002 --> 04:48.672
Um, basically, I owe Joe one.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.674
He pulled a few strings

04:50.758 --> 04:52.959
and got me out of a sticky
little situation in Jakarta,

04:53.010 --> 04:55.128
so, uh, yeah, you can trust me.

04:55.179 --> 04:57.130
You weren't supposed
to be in Jakarta.

04:57.181 --> 04:59.382

05:01.552 --> 05:03.570
What is this
called again?

05:03.638 --> 05:05.355
Loco Moco. It's a
mixture of rice,

05:05.423 --> 05:07.190
hamburger,
couple fried eggs and gravy.

05:07.275 --> 05:08.725
Mmm. Separate-- delicious.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.727
Together-- heaven.
It's great.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.812
Yeah, it's good. Listen,
have you got anything yet?

05:12.864 --> 05:14.847
Right. Um, so I managed

05:14.899 --> 05:16.483
to decipher some
of the conversation.

05:16.534 --> 05:18.034
They exchanged pleasantries.

05:18.119 --> 05:21.238
And... small talk,
small talk, small talk

05:21.322 --> 05:24.207
until... here.

05:24.292 --> 05:25.876
Your father says something
that gets a reaction.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.694
What did he say?

05:27.745 --> 05:30.580
He says, "I want to
know about Shelburne."

05:30.665 --> 05:32.465
Shelburne?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.634
And then your man Wo Fat
responds by asking,

05:34.702 --> 05:36.553
"Who told you about Shelburne?"

05:36.637 --> 05:38.204
And that's when your father

05:38.256 --> 05:39.839
turns around, and I can't see
what his response is,

05:39.891 --> 05:42.041
but Wo Fat clearly tensed up
at the word "Shelburne."

05:42.093 --> 05:44.177
Shelburne.

05:44.228 --> 05:46.513
That mean anything to you?

05:46.564 --> 05:49.065
No.

05:49.150 --> 05:51.017
KENSI: Me, neither.
Well, could be

05:51.068 --> 05:52.435
a name of someone,
or a street?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.220
It could be a code
for something.

05:54.272 --> 05:55.939
I don't think so.
I ran it through

05:56.023 --> 05:57.440
Naval Encryption Database
and didn't get anything.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.892
Mokoto led us to this video.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.912
Maybe he knows
what Shelburne is.

06:01.996 --> 06:03.079
KENSI:
I'm sorry.

06:03.164 --> 06:04.414
Who's Mokoto?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.367
KENSI:
Really, guys?

06:07.418 --> 06:08.535
I've got level five
security clearance.

06:08.586 --> 06:10.036
I can run his name
whether you tell me

06:10.087 --> 06:12.205
who he is or not,
so are we gonna do this or what?

06:12.256 --> 06:14.090
Why were you in Jakarta?

06:14.175 --> 06:15.408
Another story, another day.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.427
Anything you tell me about
Mokoto stays between us.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.296

06:19.380 --> 06:23.350
Mokoto hired my father
to investigate Governor Jameson.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.418
Yeah. Danny.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.438
I'll be right there.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.390
I caught a case.
I got to go.

06:30.441 --> 06:31.975
Thanks for the help,
okay? Aloha.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.145
Aloha. Mahalo
for the breakfast.

06:39.617 --> 06:42.652
Something tells me
he's not going to let this go.

06:42.737 --> 06:44.937
No.

06:51.629 --> 06:53.112
CHIN:
<i>Vic was Jake Griffin.</i>

06:53.164 --> 06:54.431
The restaurant guy?

06:54.498 --> 06:55.765
Yeah, one and only.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.701
Five restaurants in Hawaii,
20 on the mainland.

06:57.768 --> 07:00.203
Oh, you got to sell a lot
of misoyaki butterfish

07:00.271 --> 07:01.921
to buy a place like this, huh?

07:01.973 --> 07:03.289
Never would
have pegged you

07:03.341 --> 07:04.708
as a butterfish
type of guy.

07:04.775 --> 07:06.292
No, I'm not.
I'm really not.

07:06.344 --> 07:08.845
My wallet is not, either,
but I weaned Grace off

07:08.913 --> 07:10.246
of fish sticks
onto butterfish,

07:10.314 --> 07:12.131
and now it is her favorite,
so that's good.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.633
It's good.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.353
Yeah. Pool guy found the
body duct-taped to a chair,

07:16.437 --> 07:17.937
single gunshot
wound to the chest.

07:17.989 --> 07:19.305
STEVE:
What we got, Lori?

07:19.357 --> 07:20.790
Body was dumped in the pool.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.525
MAX:
Unfortunately, chlorinated water

07:22.610 --> 07:25.195
is quite effective
at eliminating trace evidence.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.696
Oh, that's convenient.

07:26.781 --> 07:28.531
Or premeditated.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.316
MAX:
However, based on

07:30.368 --> 07:32.318
the size of the contact
muzzle burn

07:32.370 --> 07:34.371
and at the entry wound,

07:34.455 --> 07:36.539
I would hazard a preliminary
guess that the victim

07:36.624 --> 07:40.794
was shot with a .38 caliber
handgun at point-blank range.

07:40.845 --> 07:42.512
HPD turn up a
murder weapon yet?

07:42.596 --> 07:44.597
Not yet. They're inside
processing.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.882
It looks like a
robbery gone bad.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.051
How you think
this went down, Lori?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.603
Well, usually,
the most dangerous time

07:50.671 --> 07:53.056
in an encounter like this is
before the victim's restrained,

07:53.140 --> 07:54.524
'cause usually
that's when a struggle

07:54.608 --> 07:57.677
can happen, but what bothers me
about this is,

07:57.728 --> 07:58.695
Jake was already
duct-taped to the chair.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.280
All right,
so he poses no threat,

08:00.347 --> 08:01.398
he can't fight back.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.982
So, why shoot him?

08:03.034 --> 08:04.200
Yeah.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.856
CHIN: Several Reuben Tam
paintings taken.

08:09.907 --> 08:14.044
Jewelry, silverware,
electronics.

08:14.111 --> 08:15.712
DANNY:
Okay, so,

08:15.780 --> 08:18.214
these thieves definitely
knew what they were after.

08:18.299 --> 08:19.516
Yeah, HPD says

08:19.583 --> 08:21.651
there were other home invasions
in Honolulu this week.

08:21.719 --> 08:23.219
- Same M.O.?
- Yeah.

08:23.304 --> 08:25.221
Minus the dead guy
in the pool.

08:25.289 --> 08:26.573
All right, let's call HPD,

08:26.640 --> 08:27.924
let's make sure we know
everything there is to know

08:28.008 --> 08:29.092
about these other
home invasion cases.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.760
Yeah.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.851
Our victim--
he have a family?

08:37.902 --> 08:39.051
He's divorced.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.236
Wife's on the mainland.

08:40.321 --> 08:41.938
They got one kid.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.690
Josh, 14.
Lives here.

08:43.741 --> 08:46.776

It's 3:15.

08:46.861 --> 08:47.944
Yeah. So?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.029

Yes.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.452
- I'm Samantha.
- Is Josh okay?

09:48.503 --> 09:49.619
He's fine. He's with
one of our detectives.

09:49.670 --> 09:51.004
There's
someone here

09:51.089 --> 09:52.205
to see you, buddy.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.674
Josh.

09:54.759 --> 09:58.295
Oh, God.
(sighs)

09:58.346 --> 10:00.997
It's gonna be okay.

10:01.065 --> 10:02.265
It's gonna
be okay.

10:08.890 --> 10:11.308
Kid makes the
lacrosse team today.

10:11.359 --> 10:14.061
He can't wait to come
home and tell his pop.

10:16.197 --> 10:19.399
Danny, we're gonna find
the people who did this.

10:28.326 --> 10:32.079
All right, these other two
home invasions-- what do we got?

10:32.163 --> 10:33.947
CHIN: Well, both took place
within the last five days

10:34.015 --> 10:35.382
in the same
upscale neighborhoods,

10:35.450 --> 10:37.167
both with the same M.O.

10:37.218 --> 10:38.718
Four masked gunmen were waiting
for the families

10:38.803 --> 10:39.719
inside their homes.

10:39.804 --> 10:41.138
No signs of forced entry.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.473
These guys duct-taped
the men to chairs

10:43.541 --> 10:45.392
and beat them in front
of their wives and children

10:45.476 --> 10:48.895
until they gave up the location
of their valuables-- unreal.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.697
Right, but Jake Griffin
was alone, right?

10:50.765 --> 10:52.899
Josh had not come
home from school yet.

10:52.967 --> 10:55.552
Mm-hmm, maybe that's why
the situation escalated.

10:55.603 --> 10:56.770
I mean, they had
no leverage.

10:56.854 --> 10:58.438
Maybe that's why
Jake fought back.

10:58.523 --> 11:00.540
Yeah, maybe, but why were
these people targeted

11:00.608 --> 11:01.725
in the first place?

11:01.793 --> 11:03.310
What's the link?
There has to be a link.

11:03.377 --> 11:05.078
Well, typically
home invaders have been

11:05.146 --> 11:06.713
inside their victims' homes
prior to the attack.

11:06.781 --> 11:10.667
They use that opportunity to
assess their victims' assets.

11:10.734 --> 11:13.069
All right, so then we
cross-check maids, contractors,

11:13.121 --> 11:14.621
deliveries-- anyone with access
to their homes.

11:14.705 --> 11:16.439
Yes, start with that.

11:16.507 --> 11:17.907
We'll talk to the victims,

11:17.959 --> 11:20.160
see if they remember anything
they forgot in the statements.

11:25.550 --> 11:28.051
WOMAN: We already told
the other detectives,

11:28.102 --> 11:29.636
we don't remember anything.

11:29.704 --> 11:31.087
Okay, sometimes
being back

11:31.139 --> 11:32.722
in a specific environment
that you were at

11:32.773 --> 11:34.524
just prior to a trauma
can trigger a memory.

11:34.592 --> 11:36.860
STEVE: The only thing that you
and the other victims

11:36.927 --> 11:39.029
have in common was that
you all ate at high-end

11:39.096 --> 11:40.480
Waikiki restaurants
in the days

11:40.565 --> 11:41.982
leading up to
the attacks.

11:42.066 --> 11:44.100
Restaurants that you frequent
at least once a week.

11:44.152 --> 11:48.038
Look, we want to help,
we do, but

11:48.105 --> 11:51.491
I was duct-taped to a chair
and had a gun put to my head

11:51.576 --> 11:52.942
in front of my wife
and kids.

11:52.994 --> 11:55.662
I don't remember
much beyond that.

11:55.746 --> 11:56.796
Understand.

11:56.881 --> 11:58.498
My kids thought
they were going to die.

12:00.351 --> 12:03.753
When a violation of
this kind takes place,

12:03.804 --> 12:06.673
the experience can be
extremely traumatic.

12:06.757 --> 12:11.011
It'll take some time,
but you will get past it.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.732
Try and think back

12:15.799 --> 12:18.318
to when you were arriving
or when you were leaving.

12:18.402 --> 12:20.136
Do you remember
anybody bumping into you?

12:20.188 --> 12:22.472
Ask you for directions,
use your phone?

12:22.523 --> 12:24.807
No, nothing
like that.

12:24.859 --> 12:27.194
Did your purse ever
leave your side?

12:27.278 --> 12:30.480
No, I always keep it
on the table so I can see it.

12:30.531 --> 12:33.316
What about your car?

12:33.367 --> 12:34.651
What, what about it?

12:34.702 --> 12:35.652
Where'd you park?

12:35.703 --> 12:37.003
Uh, down the street.

12:37.088 --> 12:38.004
WOMAN:
No, you didn't.

12:38.089 --> 12:39.005
Remember, honey,

12:39.073 --> 12:40.674
we were running late
and you valeted.

12:40.758 --> 12:42.709
No, I parked...

12:42.793 --> 12:44.761
Wait, um,
you're right.

12:44.829 --> 12:46.463
I gave my car to the valet.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.768
Do you keep your house keys
on the same key chain?

12:51.835 --> 12:53.436
I do.

12:53.504 --> 12:54.938
Why do you ask?

12:55.005 --> 12:58.758
We'll be in touch, but call us
if you remember anything.

12:58.826 --> 12:59.776
Thank you.

12:59.843 --> 13:01.428
Thank you.

13:01.495 --> 13:04.447
(phone rings)

13:04.515 --> 13:05.448
What's up?

13:05.516 --> 13:06.733
Danny, is there
a valet stand

13:06.801 --> 13:08.201
out the front
of that restaurant?

13:08.286 --> 13:09.736
Yes, there is.

13:09.820 --> 13:13.406
Very bright orange and yellow
sign-- Kokua Valet.

13:13.491 --> 13:15.125
Let me guess-- you, too.

13:15.192 --> 13:16.576
Yeah, I think
we just found

13:16.661 --> 13:18.662
our link.

13:22.917 --> 13:24.801
Kokua Valet-- they serviced
all the restaurants

13:24.868 --> 13:27.170
where the vics ate,
including Jake Griffin's place.

13:27.221 --> 13:29.556
Yeah, the company has got
20 freelance employees

13:29.640 --> 13:31.458
on the payroll, but get this--

13:31.525 --> 13:35.312
four specific employees
all worked together the nights

13:35.379 --> 13:36.379
the victims were
at the restaurants.

13:36.430 --> 13:39.215
Let me guess,
all four of 'em were off

13:39.267 --> 13:41.101
the days
that the invasions took place.

13:41.185 --> 13:42.218
You got it.

13:42.270 --> 13:43.903
Any of these four
got a record?

13:43.988 --> 13:45.655
Yeah, one.

13:47.775 --> 13:49.609
Oh, Dave Lockhart,

13:49.694 --> 13:52.895
proud owner of a string of
petty theft and robbery charges.

13:52.947 --> 13:54.614
This guy working tonight?

13:54.699 --> 13:57.066
Nope, and neither
are the others.

13:57.118 --> 13:58.251
(knocking)
STEVE: <i>Dave Lockhart.</i>

13:58.336 --> 14:00.086
<i>Five-O.</i>
<i>Open up.</i>

14:01.739 --> 14:03.006
Clear right.

14:08.912 --> 14:11.765
Clear left.
Room clear.

14:20.558 --> 14:22.559
Last room clear.

14:23.811 --> 14:24.861
Nobody's home.

14:24.928 --> 14:26.479
They could be
on the prowl.

14:28.766 --> 14:30.116
Find something?

14:30.201 --> 14:33.703
Yeah, looks like these guys are
taking impressions of the keys

14:33.771 --> 14:35.989
on the job, then they come
back here, they make copies.

14:36.073 --> 14:39.492
I got molds,
I got some kind of polymer gel.

14:39.577 --> 14:40.794
All right,
I give you ten to one,

14:40.878 --> 14:41.878
we check the victim's locks,

14:41.945 --> 14:42.962
we find trace evidence
of this stuff.

14:44.882 --> 14:46.549
STEVE:
What do you got, Chin?

14:46.617 --> 14:49.135
Surveillance pictures.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.621
Looks like our suspects
cased all the houses

14:51.672 --> 14:53.623
before they hit 'em.

14:53.674 --> 14:55.342
(talks softly)

14:55.426 --> 14:56.726
DANNY:
All right, I know that one.

14:56.794 --> 14:59.512
That's the Laskos',
there's Doroughty's.

15:00.598 --> 15:02.482
I do not recognize
this one. You?

15:02.566 --> 15:03.650
No.

15:03.734 --> 15:04.684
Could be there right now.

15:04.769 --> 15:05.769
I'll get a picture.

15:07.137 --> 15:08.655
STEVE:
Sun's to the east.

15:08.739 --> 15:09.939
Looks like Aina Haina.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.108
Yeah, Kono, listen, Chin sending
you through a photo.

15:12.159 --> 15:13.526
Find that house
for us right away.

15:13.611 --> 15:14.944
We think
they could be hitting it.

15:16.647 --> 15:19.032
(woman screaming)

15:19.116 --> 15:21.984
Just let my family go, I'll
give you whatever you want.

15:22.036 --> 15:23.036
Shut up.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.504
WOMAN:
Don't hurt him, please.

15:24.588 --> 15:26.139
Shut up.
No, stop.

15:26.207 --> 15:28.425
I'll give you whatever you want.
I said shut up.

15:28.492 --> 15:29.759
(woman screaming)

15:35.195 --> 15:36.476
Where's the safe?
Huh? (gun cocks)

15:36.477 --> 15:37.777
Don't make me ask you again.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.598
How many guys are
we looking at here?

15:41.599 --> 15:43.100
Looks like we got
three home invaders,

15:43.167 --> 15:44.768
no sign of the fourth.

15:44.836 --> 15:46.270
KONO:
Hostage count is four.

15:46.337 --> 15:47.838
LORI:
Two adults, two children.

15:47.889 --> 15:49.556
- Looks like they're already restrained.
- Laser mic is online.

15:49.641 --> 15:51.675
HOME INVADER: Tell me where it is
or you're all going to die.

15:51.726 --> 15:52.726
HUSBAND:
In the office behind the plasma.

15:52.811 --> 15:53.877
STEVE:
We got to breach

15:53.945 --> 15:55.679
and we got to breach right now.
Okay, Chin,

15:55.730 --> 15:56.780
Lori, you guys
take the rear.

15:56.848 --> 15:57.848
You two, you're on me.

15:57.899 --> 15:59.149
All right, come on.

16:05.373 --> 16:07.374
(glass breaking)

16:10.194 --> 16:11.428
Down.

16:13.331 --> 16:15.582
(grunting)

16:16.351 --> 16:17.918
Go, go.
Turn around.

16:18.002 --> 16:20.054
Clear left.

16:20.138 --> 16:21.305
I said turn around.

16:21.372 --> 16:23.424
Room clear.

16:23.508 --> 16:25.392
Let's see your hands.

16:25.477 --> 16:27.811
Room clear.

16:30.548 --> 16:32.316
Hands, hands, hands.

16:32.383 --> 16:35.018
Turn around and
back up to me.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.357
Clear.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.027
It's gonna be all right.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.166
Is there anybody else
in the house?

16:52.737 --> 16:55.506
Hey! Chin, Lori, number four's
coming to you right now.

16:55.573 --> 16:57.541
Five-O!
Don't move!

17:03.131 --> 17:05.682
Freeze, freeze!

17:07.919 --> 17:09.553
(grunting)

17:12.857 --> 17:13.773
(gasps)

17:13.858 --> 17:15.809
(panting)

17:18.480 --> 17:19.730
Nice work.

17:28.773 --> 17:30.791
How many times I got
to tell you, I didn't kill Jake?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.042
(sighs)
What are you doing?

17:32.109 --> 17:34.545
Why are you, uh-- are you
covering for your crew, huh?

17:34.612 --> 17:36.830
I mean, you know there is
no honor amongst thieves.

17:36.915 --> 17:38.499
Eventually they
will rat on you,

17:38.583 --> 17:40.134
so why don't you just
beat 'em to the punch?

17:40.218 --> 17:41.418
Hey.
Hey.

17:41.469 --> 17:42.452
You didn't miss anything--
this guy's

17:42.504 --> 17:44.004
vocabulary
does not stray

17:44.088 --> 17:45.956
too far
from the word "lawyer."

17:46.007 --> 17:47.007
Oh.

17:47.091 --> 17:48.642
So what happened?

17:48.726 --> 17:51.311
Jake connect the dots,
figure out

17:51.396 --> 17:52.846
you were making copies
of his customers' keys

17:52.931 --> 17:53.964
and then hitting
their homes?

17:54.015 --> 17:54.898
Lawyer.

17:54.966 --> 17:56.132
See what I mean?

17:56.184 --> 17:59.135
'Cause, you see,
this wasn't a random score.

17:59.187 --> 18:00.571
Jake was on to you,
wasn't he?

18:00.638 --> 18:01.905
Lawyer.

18:01.973 --> 18:04.158
You go to his <i>hale,</i> ask him
not to talk to the cops,

18:04.242 --> 18:05.475
and then everything goes
out the door.

18:05.527 --> 18:06.577
You crazy?

18:06.644 --> 18:07.828
I never even met the man.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.312
DANNY: What do you mean you
never met the guy?

18:09.364 --> 18:11.031
You were a valet driver
at one of his restaurants.

18:11.115 --> 18:13.149
What, do I look like an idiot?
That doesn't make any sense.

18:13.201 --> 18:15.752
No, man, the guy's just
a name on a T-shirt.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.872
His sister's the one that
ran the whole operation,

18:18.957 --> 18:20.340
at least until he
kicked her to the curb.

18:20.425 --> 18:22.593
He fired her, why?

18:22.660 --> 18:24.294
How the hell would I know? I
told you, I never met the man.

18:25.329 --> 18:28.131
Look, you think
we hit his house?

18:28.183 --> 18:30.217
Go through our stash.

18:30.301 --> 18:32.936
You won't find a damn thing
from Jake Griffin's place.

18:33.004 --> 18:35.939
By the way, lawyer.

18:36.007 --> 18:38.508
MAX:
<i>I called</i>

18:38.576 --> 18:39.726
because my findings
were highly unusual

18:39.811 --> 18:40.777
and I thought
they may be

18:40.845 --> 18:42.279
pertinent
to your investigation.

18:42.346 --> 18:43.981
Great, because we have
a suspect in custody

18:44.032 --> 18:46.116
who swears he didn't
murder Jake Griffin.

18:46.183 --> 18:48.068
Oh, how is your sense
of smell, Agent Weston?

18:48.152 --> 18:49.369
Excuse me?

18:49.454 --> 18:51.738
(sniffing)

18:51.823 --> 18:53.574
(stammers, sighs)

18:53.658 --> 18:56.460
I detect a hint
of strawberry and lavender,

18:56.527 --> 18:58.629
perhaps even
some fresh coconut.

18:58.696 --> 18:59.630
Body wash or shampoo?

18:59.697 --> 19:01.381
Max, you're
creeping me out.

19:01.466 --> 19:04.334
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't trying
to be forward, Agent Weston.

19:04.385 --> 19:06.053
I was merely trying
to prove a point.

19:06.137 --> 19:09.089
Sometimes our olfactory senses
are our best forensic tools.

19:09.173 --> 19:10.824
Okay, olfactory senses.

19:10.892 --> 19:12.392
What are you
trying to say?

19:12.477 --> 19:14.895
You didn't happen
to notice a faint odor

19:14.979 --> 19:17.547
of Australian tea tree oil
on your suspect, did you?

19:17.599 --> 19:20.267
I try not to smell
the suspects, Max. Why?

19:20.351 --> 19:22.402
Well, it is just
one of several

19:22.487 --> 19:24.771
atypical findings
in this case.

19:24.856 --> 19:27.774
When I swabbed the duct tape
that bound your victim,

19:27.859 --> 19:29.243
I was able
to recover some traces

19:29.327 --> 19:30.911
of Australian
tea tree oil

19:30.995 --> 19:32.562
and eucalyptus oil

19:32.614 --> 19:33.614
that was preserved
on the adhesive side

19:33.698 --> 19:34.615
of the duct tape.

19:34.699 --> 19:36.500
<i>As you can see,</i>

19:36.567 --> 19:37.834
Mr. Griffin
suffered no trauma

19:37.902 --> 19:40.037
or subdermal bruising
of the wrists.

19:40.088 --> 19:42.506
So our vic didn't put up a
fight when he was restrained.

19:42.573 --> 19:43.757
And I believe
I know why.

19:47.462 --> 19:49.096
I found high-velocity
blood spatter

19:49.180 --> 19:50.447
under the duct tape,

19:50.515 --> 19:52.015
which would suggest
that Jake Griffin was dead

19:52.083 --> 19:54.685
before he was taped
to the chair.

19:54.752 --> 19:56.136
Doesn't make any sense--
I mean, why shoot him

19:56.220 --> 19:57.638
and then tape him to a chair?

20:00.041 --> 20:02.926
So it turns out that our vic's
sister, Samantha Martel,

20:02.977 --> 20:05.145
was dropped from
the Griffin Enterprises payroll

20:05.213 --> 20:06.196
a few months ago.

20:06.263 --> 20:07.447
What, was she fired?

20:07.532 --> 20:09.199
Nothing in the record
that states that.

20:09.267 --> 20:10.450
When I reached out
to the company,

20:10.535 --> 20:12.903
the party line was that
Samantha left on her own

20:12.954 --> 20:14.788
to work at Jake's
charitable foundation.

20:14.872 --> 20:16.073
And what, is that legit

20:16.124 --> 20:18.208
or is the foundation just
code for tax shelter?

20:18.275 --> 20:20.110
No, n-no, Griffin did a lot of
good work for the community.

20:20.161 --> 20:21.995
I mean, the guy opened gyms
all over the island

20:22.080 --> 20:23.880
to keep kids off the street.
Noble

20:23.948 --> 20:25.232
but not as profitable.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.034
DANNY: So I just spoke
to Griffin's attorney.

20:27.101 --> 20:30.604
Um, it turns out his entire
estate and all his restaurants

20:30.672 --> 20:31.805
fall to his
son Josh

20:31.889 --> 20:33.340
but only after he turns 25.

20:33.424 --> 20:35.642
And until then, I bet
I can guess who's in control.

20:35.727 --> 20:37.010
The sister Samantha.

20:37.095 --> 20:38.762
(phone ringing) Yeah, looks like
she maybe shot her way

20:38.813 --> 20:40.597
back into
the restaurant business.

20:40.648 --> 20:42.649
Excuse me.

20:43.685 --> 20:45.635
Joe.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.104
JOE (over phone):
It's set.

20:47.155 --> 20:49.272
We're meeting Mokoto
tomorrow afternoon, his place,

20:49.324 --> 20:50.524
1600 hours.

20:50.608 --> 20:51.608
Okay, I'll be there.

20:51.659 --> 20:53.076
Hey, uh,
is Kensi still with you?

20:53.144 --> 20:54.194
No, I dropped her off

20:54.278 --> 20:56.146
at the airport an hour ago.
Why?

20:56.197 --> 20:57.130
Oh, I was just wondering.

20:57.198 --> 20:58.498
I mean, you guys seemed
to have, uh,

20:58.583 --> 20:59.950
you seemed to have quite a past.

21:00.001 --> 21:02.452
Steve, she's young enough
to be my daughter.

21:02.503 --> 21:03.620
You know something, Joe?

21:03.671 --> 21:05.839
She kind of reminds me
of wife number two.

21:05.907 --> 21:07.674
Tall, dark, lethal.

21:07.759 --> 21:08.675
Seems to be your type.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.128

21:56.641 --> 21:59.709

lack of suitable hiding places

21:59.761 --> 22:02.095
in this apartment,

22:02.180 --> 22:04.815
you set the odds
firmly in my favor.

22:11.406 --> 22:12.856
What do you want?

22:12.907 --> 22:15.075
I want to know
why you are asking questions

22:15.159 --> 22:17.060
about men that are
no longer with us.

22:19.664 --> 22:23.283
I'll stop asking
those questions

22:23.367 --> 22:26.069
when you tell me
about Shelburne.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.408
What does it mean?

22:36.047 --> 22:40.717
You've done more work than
I could have imagined, old man.

22:40.768 --> 22:42.585
Would you do me one favor?

22:42.637 --> 22:44.721
What's that?

22:44.772 --> 22:48.809

24:20.094 --> 24:22.779
SAMANTHA: He's going to need
some time to heal,

24:22.847 --> 24:24.347
but he's a
strong boy.

24:24.415 --> 24:25.815
A lot like
his father.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.400
Excuse me.

24:29.403 --> 24:30.803
Go ahead.
Thank you.

24:34.692 --> 24:36.359
Has there been any
progress in the case?

24:36.444 --> 24:38.161
As a matter of fact,
there has, yeah.

24:38.245 --> 24:40.146
That's why we're here.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.198
Mrs. Martel, uh,
where were you

24:42.283 --> 24:43.867
at the time of
your brother's murder?

24:43.951 --> 24:47.120
I was working at Jake's
charitable foundation all day,

24:47.171 --> 24:48.654
until the police
called. Why?

24:48.706 --> 24:50.423
You used to, uh, used to run

24:50.491 --> 24:52.175
a couple of restaurants
for Jake, right?

24:52.259 --> 24:55.845
Well, yeah, but what does that
have to do with anything?

24:55.930 --> 24:58.298
Well, I was just wondering
if there were any hard feelings

24:58.349 --> 24:59.549
when your brother fired you.

24:59.633 --> 25:00.550
What?

25:00.634 --> 25:02.552
No, he didn't
fire me, I quit.

25:02.636 --> 25:03.720
Really?

25:03.804 --> 25:04.971
Why would you do that?

25:05.022 --> 25:07.640
I mean, just change careers
out of the blue.

25:07.691 --> 25:10.226
Okay, look, you
don't understand.

25:10.294 --> 25:12.312
I have always loved
that foundation,

25:12.363 --> 25:15.014
working with
those kids.

25:15.065 --> 25:16.282
When a position
opened up,

25:16.350 --> 25:17.784
Jake offered me
a job full-time.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.869
I don't have anything to do
with the restaurants anymore.

25:19.954 --> 25:21.371
DANNY: Yeah, that was
true yesterday,

25:21.455 --> 25:24.574
but now that Jake's passed,
you're in control.

25:24.658 --> 25:27.460
What-- no, that's--
Jake's will?

25:27.528 --> 25:29.195
That's about
taking care of Josh.

25:31.582 --> 25:34.250
Look, I don't care
what you think.

25:34.335 --> 25:35.835
I did not kill my brother.

25:35.886 --> 25:37.370
DANNY:
Okay.

25:37.421 --> 25:40.223
Gonna have to ask you, uh,
Mrs. Martel, do you own a gun?

25:42.259 --> 25:44.594
Well, I mean,
it's not really mine.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.646
Uh, Jake had a gun.

25:46.713 --> 25:47.897
STEVE:
Well, you see,

25:47.982 --> 25:49.232
there was nothing registered

25:49.316 --> 25:50.900
in either of your names, ma'am.

25:50.985 --> 25:52.819
Well, no, it wouldn't
have been registered.

25:52.886 --> 25:55.238
Jake found out that one of
the guys that he was helping

25:55.322 --> 25:57.907
with his charity got ahold
of a gun, and he took it away.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.861
Where's the gun now?

26:09.787 --> 26:11.504
Hands up. Hands up.

26:17.461 --> 26:19.629
Jake wanted
to build a place

26:19.713 --> 26:22.265
where underprivileged kids
could come and be safe.

26:22.333 --> 26:25.268
All of these kids can
come and train for free.

26:27.338 --> 26:29.906
MAN:
Hey, Mrs. Martel.

26:29.974 --> 26:31.641
Just need you to sign
a couple things.

26:31.725 --> 26:34.978
What, you in the market
for some cleaning products?

26:36.697 --> 26:39.082
Fighters use these
to wipe down after they train.

26:39.149 --> 26:42.785
Uh, kills ringworm,
staph, MRSA.

26:42.870 --> 26:44.954
Hey, look what
they're made from.

26:45.039 --> 26:48.458
Australian tea tree oil
and eucalyptus oil.

26:48.542 --> 26:49.826
Those are the same
oils that Max found

26:49.910 --> 26:51.277
on the duct tape he
pulled off our vic.

26:51.328 --> 26:52.795
Yeah. We're good.

26:57.468 --> 26:59.285
All right, good job.

26:59.336 --> 27:02.889
Jake's gun's right in there.

27:08.729 --> 27:10.480
Honey, is everything all right?

27:10.564 --> 27:11.848
They need the gun.

27:11.932 --> 27:14.133
For what?

27:14.184 --> 27:15.101
They think that I killed Jake.

27:15.152 --> 27:16.819
What?

27:16.904 --> 27:18.971
Mr. Martel, I'm going to ask you
to just step back, all right?

27:19.023 --> 27:21.140
MR. MARTEL: Come on, brah, that's my wife
you're talking about.

27:21.191 --> 27:23.359
You don't actually think she
killed her own brother, do you?

27:23.427 --> 27:24.661
No gun.

27:24.745 --> 27:26.663
What-What do you mean?
It's got to be there.

27:26.747 --> 27:28.615
Well, it's not.

27:28.666 --> 27:30.816
When was the last
time you saw it?

27:30.868 --> 27:34.003
I don't know,
maybe a couple weeks ago.

27:34.088 --> 27:35.622
Hey, it's all right.

27:35.673 --> 27:37.123
You didn't do anything wrong.

27:37.174 --> 27:39.158
All right?

27:39.209 --> 27:43.829
Okay, um, who else knew
about this gun, besides you two?

27:43.881 --> 27:45.465
Just Jake and I.

27:45.516 --> 27:46.716
Well, and Boriero.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.501
Who's Boriero?

27:48.552 --> 27:50.053
One of the fighters
who trains here.

27:50.137 --> 27:51.688
SAMANTHA:
That's the kid I mentioned.

27:51.772 --> 27:53.189
Jake took the
gun off of him,

27:53.274 --> 27:55.642
said that if he
wanted to train here,

27:55.693 --> 27:57.644
he had to stay
out of trouble.

27:57.695 --> 28:00.063
That was one of Jake's
only rules about this place.

28:00.147 --> 28:01.898
Okay, fine. Where's he at?
Is Boriero here?

28:01.982 --> 28:03.316
No, he hasn't trained here
for a few weeks.

28:03.367 --> 28:04.867
Why is that?

28:04.952 --> 28:06.903
He left after an argument with
my brother about going pro,

28:06.987 --> 28:08.371
said that he wanted
a sponsorship.

28:08.455 --> 28:11.541
But Jake said that the
foundation wasn't about that.

28:11.625 --> 28:12.575
STEVE:
All right.

28:12.660 --> 28:14.026
You know where Boriero lives?

28:14.078 --> 28:16.162
Vitor Boriero.

28:16.213 --> 28:18.915
He went away in 2009 for taking
part in an armed robbery.

28:18.999 --> 28:21.050
He strong-armed the owner
of a Kapiolani beer joint

28:21.135 --> 28:22.502
and then cleaned
out the safe.

28:22.553 --> 28:24.587
This guy sounds like
a complete gentleman.

28:24.672 --> 28:26.172
KONO:
Guy drives an '82 Jeep

28:26.223 --> 28:27.390
CJ-7, black.

28:27.474 --> 28:29.008
It should give you
heads up if he's home.

28:29.059 --> 28:31.144
Am I driving?
Of course I'm driving.

28:31.211 --> 28:32.261
All right, thanks.

28:32.329 --> 28:34.230
Oh, and one more thing.
Word to the wise:

28:34.315 --> 28:36.015
Boriero's trained.

28:36.066 --> 28:37.734
I would not engage him
hand-to-hand.

28:37.818 --> 28:38.851
That's not going to happen.

28:38.902 --> 28:41.571
I like my gun.

28:48.529 --> 28:50.563
There's the Jeep.

28:50.614 --> 28:53.116
Looks like he's home.

28:58.455 --> 29:01.257
Doesn't look like Boriero's
worried about theft.

29:01.342 --> 29:03.242
That's one of the benefits
of being built like King Kong.

29:07.097 --> 29:08.581
Not gonna believe this.

29:08.649 --> 29:09.932
What do you got?

29:10.017 --> 29:11.267
He's obviously not very bright.

29:12.219 --> 29:14.637
Plain sight.

29:14.722 --> 29:17.206
We have a beautiful .38 caliber.

as the murder weapon.

According to this, you were in

32:37.440 --> 32:39.841
Yeah.

32:39.892 --> 32:42.143
I was sparring the night before,
took a head punch.

32:49.452 --> 32:51.369
You really think I killed Jake?

32:51.454 --> 32:53.855
How do we know this isn't
just a stab at an alibi?

32:53.906 --> 32:55.056
I might be able
to fake a wristband,

32:55.124 --> 32:56.274
but you can't fake a CT scan.

32:56.342 --> 32:57.459

why don't you tell us how

33:02.832 --> 33:04.365
Jeep's wide open.

Old habits die hard.

33:14.042 --> 33:15.894
Jake called me a loser
to my face.

33:15.978 --> 33:18.596
Not many men have the stones
to say that to me,

33:18.681 --> 33:21.048
but he was right,
and I respected him for it.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.518
I believe that. You did
respect him, up until the point

I mean, you turn pro, you get
a couple of pay-per-view fights.

33:31.327 --> 33:33.161
We're talking
about a lot of money.

33:33.228 --> 33:36.080
DANNY: It's a lot of money, but Jake
was not interested in that.

33:36.165 --> 33:38.249
Right? He didn't want his
charity to turn into a business.

33:38.334 --> 33:40.251
You guys fought over it,
and when it did not

33:40.336 --> 33:41.669
go your way, you shot him.

33:41.737 --> 33:43.037
That's crazy!

33:43.088 --> 33:44.789
Look, did I want to go pro?

33:44.907 --> 33:46.758
Sure. Who wouldn't?

33:46.842 --> 33:48.293
But I turned down
Marshall's offer,

33:48.377 --> 33:49.594
but he wouldn't let it go.

33:49.678 --> 33:51.179
DANNY:
Oh, Marshall?

33:51.246 --> 33:52.547
Jake's brother-in-law-- what
does he have to do with this?

33:52.598 --> 33:54.265
He said he'd train me,
manage me, the whole shot.

33:54.350 --> 33:56.768
Even asked me if I could recruit
a couple of the other guys, too.

33:57.887 --> 34:00.305
How much commission
was he asking for?

34:00.389 --> 34:03.358
20%.

34:03.425 --> 34:06.194
20%. When was the
last time you saw him?

34:06.261 --> 34:09.197
He came by yesterday
to break the news about Jake.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.282
Said he didn't want me
to hear it

34:11.367 --> 34:12.817
on TV.

34:12.902 --> 34:14.619
Was your jeep parked in
front when he came by?

34:14.703 --> 34:17.205
Yeah. Always in the same spot.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.292
All right, so I looked
into Marshall Martel

34:21.377 --> 34:24.161
like you asked, and I found
something very interesting.

34:24.246 --> 34:25.630
According to his
credit card statement,

34:25.714 --> 34:27.215
yesterday morning,
he spent $84

34:27.282 --> 34:29.501
at a hardware
store five blocks

34:29.585 --> 34:32.053
from the crime scene.
Check out what he bought.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.056
(computer trilling)

34:41.463 --> 34:43.031
Duct tape and cleaning supplies.

34:43.098 --> 34:44.983
Check out the time stamp.

34:46.467 --> 34:47.819
10:17.

34:47.902 --> 34:50.304
That's right around TOD.

34:50.356 --> 34:53.139
One, two. One, two, three.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.141
One. One.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.327
One, two.

34:56.411 --> 34:57.495
(whistles)
Hey!

34:57.580 --> 34:59.480
Marshall!

34:59.532 --> 35:01.315
Hang on. Just
finishing up.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.817
No, you're all finished.
Come on, you're done.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.152
Do five.

35:05.204 --> 35:08.923
MARSHALL:
What are you talking about?

35:08.991 --> 35:09.090
Talking about the fact
that you killed Jake Griffin.

35:11.159 --> 35:13.094
Excuse me?
DANNY: Yeah.

35:13.161 --> 35:14.379
Then you went
to the hardware store

35:14.463 --> 35:16.214
to cover up the crime,
which is a good indication

35:16.298 --> 35:18.099
to me that you weren't
planning on killing him.

35:18.166 --> 35:20.351
STEVE: Right, but when you did,
you wanted the cops

35:20.436 --> 35:21.436
to be looking the other way,

35:21.503 --> 35:23.938
so, you covered it up
and made it look like

35:24.006 --> 35:26.724
one of those home invasion
crimes you saw on the news.

35:26.809 --> 35:28.226
What's going on?

35:28.294 --> 35:30.061
Hands behind your back.
Come on.

35:30.145 --> 35:32.113
Marshall, why are
they arresting you?

35:32.180 --> 35:35.700
Marshall, say something.

35:35.784 --> 35:38.536
Samantha,
I'm sorry about this.

35:38.621 --> 35:39.904
Marshall, say something!

35:39.989 --> 35:42.073
Marshall?!

35:42.157 --> 35:44.358
It was an accident.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.877
I was just trying
to scare him.

35:45.961 --> 35:47.745
What? He was my brother.

35:47.830 --> 35:48.913
He had all the money
in the world.

35:48.998 --> 35:50.381
And all I wanted was a
little something for us.

35:50.466 --> 35:52.133
Something so that
we wouldn't have to come to him

35:52.200 --> 35:54.552
with hat in hand anymore,
but he just wouldn't listen.

35:54.637 --> 35:55.970
So, what, you killed him?

35:59.592 --> 36:03.561
We were arguing, he went for
the gun, it went off, and I...

36:03.646 --> 36:05.229
I panicked.

36:06.715 --> 36:08.049
I'm sorry.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.351
I'm sorry.

36:13.105 --> 36:15.106
I'm so sorry.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.443
(sighs)

36:20.446 --> 36:22.447
(panting)

36:24.583 --> 36:26.584
Oh!

36:34.510 --> 36:36.628
Excuse me.

36:36.712 --> 36:38.830
(mutters)

36:38.897 --> 36:40.431
Oh, yeah.

36:40.516 --> 36:42.517
Pardon me, <i>wahine.</i>
Excuse me, brother. Pardon me.

36:42.584 --> 36:45.436
Sure, make sure everybody
gets some, brah. Yeah.

36:45.521 --> 36:47.021
Kona.
Oh.

36:47.089 --> 36:49.140
Oh, good seats, huh?

36:49.224 --> 36:50.191
(Kamekona sighs)

36:50.258 --> 36:51.592
Oh, yeah.

36:51.660 --> 36:55.697
That is, um, a lot of popcorn,
even for you, Kamekona.

36:55.764 --> 36:58.666
Oh, give me
some kakimochi.

36:58.734 --> 37:01.786
Air-popped.
Healthy kind, sistah.

37:01.870 --> 37:03.021
You guys hungry?

37:03.088 --> 37:05.106
Don't mind if I do.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.026
Oh, easy, brah!

37:08.093 --> 37:09.327
No more refills

37:09.411 --> 37:10.795
over here.

37:10.879 --> 37:12.797
I know this is for charity,
but this is crazy.

37:12.881 --> 37:13.998
Right? Even
for McGarrett.

37:14.083 --> 37:15.717
So, his opponent...

37:16.785 --> 37:18.302
It says in his statistics here

37:18.387 --> 37:20.254
that he's 21 and eight,
with 13 TKO's.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.056
What's a TKO?

37:22.124 --> 37:24.592
It means that 13 of his
opponents were unable

37:24.643 --> 37:26.144
to continue fighting him.

37:26.228 --> 37:27.645
Oh, so that's a good thing then?

37:28.564 --> 37:31.566
Not for McGarrett.

37:31.633 --> 37:32.734
LORI:
Okay, listen.

37:32.801 --> 37:36.470
Listen, the mantra is,
"This is all for charity."

37:36.522 --> 37:38.189
Okay, so you have to say it.

37:38.273 --> 37:39.357
I'll be fine.

37:39.441 --> 37:40.491
Okay.

37:40.576 --> 37:41.876
BORIERO:
Yo, McGarrett?

37:41.944 --> 37:44.662
Thanks for taking my spot
on the card.

37:44.747 --> 37:46.080
Jake

37:46.148 --> 37:47.982
wouldn't want the fans
cheated out of a fight.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.167
It's all for the kids, brah.

37:49.251 --> 37:50.985
I'll try to put on
a good show for you.

37:51.036 --> 37:54.205
Besides, I'm the one who
dislocated your shoulder.

37:54.289 --> 37:55.373
(laughs)

37:55.441 --> 37:57.458
Yeah, I didn't forget.

37:58.794 --> 38:00.294
Hit 'em hard, bro.

38:01.830 --> 38:03.014
Excuse me, Miss.

38:03.098 --> 38:05.216
Yeah, thanks. All right.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.351
ANNOUNCER:
And now, for our main event,

38:07.436 --> 38:09.937
MMA legend
Chuck "The Iceman" Liddell

38:10.005 --> 38:12.724
takes on hometown hero
Steve McGarrett

38:12.808 --> 38:14.842
in an exhibition charity match.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.011
(Lori clears her throat)

38:17.062 --> 38:19.013
Okay, that's your cue and
your last chance to back out.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.948
Would you...?

38:22.317 --> 38:23.334
DANNY:
It's your funeral.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.704
(cheering)

38:26.789 --> 38:28.823
♪ ♪

38:36.364 --> 38:37.965
Okay, stay down!

38:38.033 --> 38:40.718
Let's go home. Can we
go home? Stay down.

38:40.803 --> 38:42.369
It's charity.
Don't get up.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.838
Stay down.

38:48.310 --> 38:51.145
(cheering swells)

38:51.880 --> 38:53.097
(shouting)

38:53.165 --> 38:55.266
Go! Yes! Come on!

38:55.334 --> 38:56.567
Come on.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.321
(audience groans)

39:00.388 --> 39:01.739
Oh.

39:01.824 --> 39:03.775
Oh, you the man.

39:03.859 --> 39:06.661
I didn't know an arm could
bend that far back, brah.

39:06.728 --> 39:07.945
MAX: Actually, the
rotator cuff

39:08.030 --> 39:09.497
has an amazing range
of mobility.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.065
LORI:
You want me

39:11.116 --> 39:12.166
to get you a steak for that eye?

39:12.234 --> 39:15.236
Right? Who knew charity
hurt so much?

39:15.287 --> 39:17.505
Boss, when you got back up,
and went after that guy,

39:17.572 --> 39:18.572
it was pure...

39:18.624 --> 39:19.824
Pure <i>imua,</i> brah!

39:19.892 --> 39:21.676
DANNY:
That means pure

39:21.743 --> 39:22.927
stupidity, and we're
all in agreement.

39:23.011 --> 39:25.079
What you got going on
with that hand there, Danno?

39:25.130 --> 39:26.798
DANNY: I figured while
you're at it,

39:26.915 --> 39:28.082
bring it.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.084
(laughter, phone ringing)

39:30.109 --> 39:31.893
Allright, get the chairs
outta the way, let's go.

39:32.181 --> 39:33.748
CHIN:
My money's on the SEAL.

39:33.816 --> 39:36.218
KAMEKONA: I'll take that action,
Danny's one scrappah.

39:51.976 --> 39:53.977
STEVE:
Joe.

39:56.014 --> 39:57.981
What happened to you?

39:58.049 --> 39:59.533
Where's Mokoto?

39:59.601 --> 40:01.301
He's dead.

40:01.369 --> 40:02.819
Dead? What happened?

40:02.887 --> 40:04.220
I got here.

40:04.272 --> 40:07.223
Door was open, his
body's in the study.

40:07.275 --> 40:09.660
Looks like he
was tortured.

40:09.727 --> 40:11.495
What?!

40:12.664 --> 40:15.365
Who would torture an old man
in a wheelchair?

40:18.235 --> 40:20.170
Wo Fat.

40:20.237 --> 40:21.421
I don't understand.

40:21.506 --> 40:22.873
Why-Why would he come here?

40:22.924 --> 40:24.841
How did he know about Mokoto?

40:24.909 --> 40:26.927
Wo Fat paid me a visit
last night.

40:27.011 --> 40:28.845
What are you talking about?

40:28.913 --> 40:30.797
Got the jump on me,
and then he disappeared.

40:30.882 --> 40:32.849
Did you tell him about Mokoto?

40:32.917 --> 40:35.552
No... but he must have known.

40:37.555 --> 40:39.306
Okay.

40:39.390 --> 40:40.524
Wo Fat's either cleaning house,

40:40.591 --> 40:42.142
or he's looking
for answers, right?

40:42.226 --> 40:43.810
(sirens wailing)

40:43.895 --> 40:45.362
We did this.

40:45.429 --> 40:47.147
What?

40:47.231 --> 40:49.399
Our questions got Mokoto killed.

40:49.450 --> 40:52.569
No, Joe.

40:52.620 --> 40:53.987
Wo Fat started this.

40:55.606 --> 40:57.607
But I plan to finish it.

40:58.626 --> 40:59.675
You continue to go
down this road, son,

40:59.676 --> 41:01.343
you got to ask yourself,

41:01.394 --> 41:04.346
how many more lives
is that gonna cost?
