00:12.278 --> 00:14.680
It's hard to believe,

00:14.682 --> 00:16.347
but we have come to the end
of another week

00:16.350 --> 00:17.649
of Seattle pulse!

00:17.651 --> 00:19.084
We still have a minute left,

00:19.086 --> 00:21.320
and you all know
what that means.

00:21.322 --> 00:24.423
I will answer as many questions
as you can throw at me

00:24.425 --> 00:25.624
in 30 seconds.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.726
Caller one, you're on.

00:27.728 --> 00:31.663
I have two words--
"natural metallics."

00:31.665 --> 00:33.132
Spring sale at shoe inc.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.333
Caller two!

00:34.335 --> 00:35.567
Best steak house
for the in-laws

00:35.569 --> 00:36.635
coming in
from Pittsburgh?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.103
Well, that's a no-brainer.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.472
Make sure to ask
for a patio table.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.540
Caller three!

00:41.542 --> 00:44.109
Local wine to serve
with sea bass?

00:44.111 --> 00:46.712
Chateau St. Michelle
chardonnay, 2006.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.081
All right, that is it
for Seattle pulse,

00:49.083 --> 00:50.282
the heartbeat of the city.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.650
This is Emma silver,

00:51.652 --> 00:52.751
reminding you
to smell the coffee,

00:52.753 --> 00:54.119
drive carefully,

00:54.121 --> 00:56.321
and, of course,

00:56.323 --> 00:58.123
join us again on Monday.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.591
Hey,
great show.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.360
Oh, thanks.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.795
You got a sec?

01:02.797 --> 01:03.796
For you, ed, always.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.129
[Chuckles warmly]

01:05.132 --> 01:07.066
Well, I'll just
cut to the chase.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.668
We are now part of
the worldmedia merger.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.472
I'm not really sure
i like the sound of that.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.707
Read my lips,
nothing's going to change.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.277
Well, how can you be so sure?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.511
Kbmu's been around
for 40 years.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.847
They're not going to tamper
with success.

01:21.849 --> 01:25.117
I uprooted my life in New York
to move here for this job.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.552
I know.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.253
I invested my savings
in a condo.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.688
Understood.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.191
I have a dentist,
i have a hairdresser,

01:32.193 --> 01:33.325
I have a nail salon

01:33.327 --> 01:35.294
that actually
understands my cuticles.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.328
Are you done?

01:36.330 --> 01:40.365
I have a three-year
iron-clad contract.

01:40.367 --> 01:43.735
"Nothing's going to change"
did you miss?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.337
Enjoy your weekend.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.472
I'll do my best.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.840
See you later.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.441
Emma, you have
a call on line two.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.743
He said
it's important.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.846
Hello.

01:53.848 --> 01:57.282
Yeah, this is Emma silver.

02:00.753 --> 02:04.189
[Ed humming merrily]

02:08.661 --> 02:09.794
Ed...

02:09.797 --> 02:11.430
Hmm?
oh, hey.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.699
Uh, I...

02:13.701 --> 02:14.800
I-i got a call,

02:14.802 --> 02:16.168
and I won't be in
on Monday.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.369
I have to go
to valleyville.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.904
Uh...

02:18.906 --> 02:20.506
My grandfather died.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.341
Aw, geez, Emma.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.509
I'm so sorry.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.676
So I'm going to make

02:24.678 --> 02:27.679
a... list of, uh, encore shows

02:27.681 --> 02:28.814
for you to air while I'm away--

02:28.816 --> 02:30.782
okay, don't worry.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.484
I'll take care of things here.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.420
You just do what
you have to do, huh?

02:35.422 --> 02:37.856
I'm so sorry.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.458
[Sniffles]

02:40.493 --> 02:45.864
[♪]

03:46.960 --> 03:47.960
Is it supposed to rain?

03:47.962 --> 03:48.961
That's what
they're saying.

03:48.963 --> 03:49.828
I don't think so.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.662
Anybody know?

03:50.664 --> 03:51.563
I'm not sure, though.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.770
Hey there, hon,
are you lost?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.305
I think I have
the wrong address.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.740
I'm looking for a law office.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.542
Oh, well...

04:04.577 --> 04:05.877
You must be Emma.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.246
Hi.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.480
My condolences.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.948
I'm Bobby Ellis.
I called you.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.717
Uh...

04:11.719 --> 04:13.585
I thought you said

04:13.587 --> 04:15.320
that you were
an attorney?

04:15.322 --> 04:18.624
But a man has to have
a lot of irons in the fire.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.825
[Chuckles]

04:19.827 --> 04:20.858
If you want to
follow me,

04:20.861 --> 04:22.728
my office is
out back.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.597
So that's Walt's
granddaughter?

04:25.599 --> 04:26.698
Are you out of
your mind?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.866
Walt's granddaughter
used to come up here

04:27.868 --> 04:31.903
she had short hair
and freckles.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.272
When she was
12, maybe.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.439
12, wasn't that
about the time

04:34.441 --> 04:35.841
you learned to read?

04:35.843 --> 04:38.577
Don't make me
hurt you, Hank.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.845
It's funny, we've
lived here 15 years.

04:39.847 --> 04:43.382
Never laid eyes on her,
have we, Jeff?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.316
Yeah, she stopped
coming by

04:44.318 --> 04:45.384
after the accident.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.551
What accident?

04:46.553 --> 04:47.552
Her folks.

04:47.554 --> 04:48.820
Real good people.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.722
No, no, no,
not good people.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.959
Emma was away
at college,

04:53.961 --> 04:56.495
and they were coming
in from the city

04:56.497 --> 04:58.930
no, no, it was
Thanksgiving.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.499
Their anniversary's
in the summer, fool--

05:00.501 --> 05:01.566
whatever!

05:01.568 --> 05:02.901
Anyway,
there was a storm,

05:02.903 --> 05:05.737
and their car
missed a curve...

05:05.739 --> 05:07.472
It was real tragic.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.408
Yeah...

05:09.410 --> 05:10.809
Okay, I think this is...

05:10.811 --> 05:12.778
Yup, Walt silver...

05:12.780 --> 05:14.746
The file.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.916
So, uh...

05:17.918 --> 05:20.585
How do I go about
making the arrangements?

05:20.587 --> 05:23.455
Well, there's no need.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.556
As soon as Walt
found out he was sick,

05:24.558 --> 05:25.891
he took care of
everything.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.794
He left a very specific
set of instructions.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.462
I didn't even know
that gramps was ill.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.531
For the last six months, yeah.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.766
If he'd told me,
i would've been here.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.668
Emma, you were
very precious to Walt.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.903
He bragged about you
all the time,

05:37.905 --> 05:41.406
about your radio show
and all your success.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.474
He even
showed me albums

05:42.476 --> 05:44.676
of the trips
you took together.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.478
Bobby, I really appreciate you
telling me this,

05:46.480 --> 05:47.479
but still--

05:47.481 --> 05:48.914
well, you know
what they say...

05:48.916 --> 05:52.551
"Nothing drags heavier
than a big old sack of regret."

05:52.553 --> 05:54.853
Walt went out
on his own terms.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.822
You got to
respect that.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.390
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.927
Your grandfather wanted
a very simple funeral,

06:01.929 --> 06:03.628
followed by a hearty lunch
back at the farm

06:03.630 --> 06:04.596
for all of his friends.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.798
He even specified
the menu.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.867
Fried chicken,
garlic mashed potatoes,

06:08.869 --> 06:10.469
corn on the cob,

06:10.471 --> 06:11.603
and, of course,

06:11.605 --> 06:13.805
pumpkin pie for dessert.

06:13.807 --> 06:14.840
[Laughs]

06:14.842 --> 06:17.542
Yeah, that, uh...

06:17.544 --> 06:19.978
Wow, that sounds like him.

06:19.980 --> 06:20.879
I'll take care of it.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.647
Oh, there's no need.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.982
The ladies are cooking up
a storm as we speak.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.817
Services are Monday at noon.

06:27.587 --> 06:30.789
Now, if you
can just sign...

06:30.791 --> 06:32.657
These,

06:32.659 --> 06:34.659
I can officially
hand over the keys.

06:35.862 --> 06:36.795
The keys?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.699
To the farmhouse?

06:41.868 --> 06:43.568
He left me the farm?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.804
You're his next of kin.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.574
I don't actually know
what to do with a farm--

06:49.576 --> 06:51.910
there's...
something else.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.845
There it is.

06:53.847 --> 06:58.984
This...
is for you too.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.823
What are they?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.925
They're pumpkin seeds.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.995
Walt's
pumpkin seeds.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.630
Why would he leave me these?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.932
Maybe he wanted you to enter
the pumpkin growing contest,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.834
keep the tradition going,
so to speak.

07:15.836 --> 07:16.902
[Laughs]

07:16.904 --> 07:20.839
I-i don't know anything
about pumpkins.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.040
Ah, you're
Walt's granddaughter.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.609
It's in your genes.
It's part of your DNA.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.844
Yeah, well,

07:25.846 --> 07:26.878
there's a missing link
somewhere.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.013
And this is
for you as well.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.755
He always called me Emmy-Lou...

07:36.757 --> 07:39.991
You can call me
if you have any questions.

07:41.694 --> 07:42.928
[Walt silver]:
<i>"Dearest Emmy-Lou...</i>

07:42.930 --> 07:46.031
<i>You're probably</i>
<i>not too pleased with me</i>

07:46.033 --> 07:47.899
<i>for foisting the farm on you,</i>

07:47.901 --> 07:50.001
<i>but here's the thing...</i>

07:50.003 --> 07:52.571
<i>This land,</i>
<i>small though it may be,</i>

07:52.573 --> 07:53.772
<i>is my legacy,</i>

07:53.774 --> 07:56.708
<i>mine and grandma Eleanor's.</i>

07:56.710 --> 07:59.544
<i>Every seed</i>
<i>was planted with love.</i>

07:59.546 --> 08:02.881
<i>Every tree grows with</i>
<i>a bit of our souls in it.</i>

08:02.883 --> 08:05.951
<i>I just can't go to my maker</i>

08:05.953 --> 08:08.119
<i>thinking it will be razed</i>
<i>to become a highway</i>

08:08.121 --> 08:10.889
<i>or a parking lot.</i>

08:10.891 --> 08:12.991
<i>I know you're not a farmer,</i>

08:12.993 --> 08:16.027
<i>but I also know</i>
<i>how smart you are.</i>

08:16.029 --> 08:18.663
[Emma's voice continues
reading]: <i>"...To make sure</i>

08:18.665 --> 08:19.965
<i>the place goes to someone</i>

08:22.802 --> 08:24.569
"I'm counting on you
to take care of the things

08:24.571 --> 08:28.073
that I couldn't take care of.

08:28.075 --> 08:32.077
I love you, my sweet girl..."

08:49.962 --> 08:53.031
[Chugging engine approaches]

09:04.944 --> 09:06.711
Hey, boys.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.979
Hey.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.952
Seth, it's been over a week.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.787
When's my tractor
going to be ready?

09:15.789 --> 09:17.689
You ready to pay me?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.724
Oh, you know
the answer to that.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.893
How about Betty bakes you
a couple of her delicious pies?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.862
My freezer's already full
of Betty's pies.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.097
I need cash, guys,
so I can open my shop.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.633
So that I can earn the cash
to pay you.

09:28.635 --> 09:29.801
Oh, yeah,
right.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.970
Well, you
figure it out.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.205
You know, this is why
mighty muffler's

09:34.207 --> 09:35.840
going to put you
out of business.

09:35.842 --> 09:39.144
Yeah, but mighty muffler
isn't going to have

09:39.146 --> 09:41.980
my flexible pay-as-you-can
schedule, are they?

09:41.982 --> 09:44.749
But at least
I'd have my tractor.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.850
Ah, whatever,
it's done.

09:45.852 --> 09:46.985
It's behind
the barn.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.019
What?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.956
Why didn't you just
tell me in the first place?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.224
At least I can have a little fun
watching you squirm.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.126
[Laughing]

09:55.128 --> 09:58.096
Seth, take a look
at this thing.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.864
Seems to be missing
something under here,

09:59.866 --> 10:02.067
I don't know.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.005
Well, for a couple
of your pumpkin seeds,

10:07.007 --> 10:08.740
I will.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.843
I don't think I have any
to, uh, spare this year.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.646
I need that prize money.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.647
Russell, how about you?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.015
Well, no offense,

10:17.017 --> 10:19.884
but I can't share
my winning seeds.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.886
Why don't you ask your
new neighbor over there?

10:21.888 --> 10:23.989
Walt's
granddaughter.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.091
Now, she's got seeds.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.093
Really?

Emma silver.

12:12.264 --> 12:15.900
So, do you always break
into people's houses?

12:15.902 --> 12:17.902
Well, do you always threaten
to mace your visitors?

12:18.971 --> 12:20.238
I'll have you know

12:20.240 --> 12:22.874
that this is
a very sensible precaution

12:22.876 --> 12:25.376
for a woman who lives alone.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.811
Oh, well, maybe
you haven't noticed,

12:26.813 --> 12:29.047
but these aren't exactly
the mean streets.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.915
Okay, you could have knocked.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.150
I did knock.

It's what I do.

Okay, um....

Well, I'll just
get my purse, then.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.462
Yeah.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.897
I was mistaken.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.398
I believe
the technical term

13:20.400 --> 13:22.066
is "paranoid."

13:22.068 --> 13:24.002
Oh, and I believe
the legal term

13:24.004 --> 13:25.270
is "breaking and entering."

13:25.272 --> 13:27.372
I was fixing
your lock.

Well, who asked you to?

Your grandfather, actually.

We were friends.

We helped
each other out.

i think we'll just

Good to see you made it
through the night.

Do you have
enough food?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.148
Because there's
a feedbag by the barn.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.918
Well, I'll keep that in mind
when I go back for seconds.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.321
Did I mention
that I do auto repairs?

14:50.323 --> 14:52.190
Because that little
BMW of yours

14:52.192 --> 14:53.524

a tweak.

are always over-tuned.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.168
He has a habit
of doing that.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.236

take care of".

15:18.051 --> 15:20.385
Do you know
what he meant by that?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.287
Your grandfather was in debt.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.255
Serious debt.

15:24.257 --> 15:28.092
Gramps was as sensible
as they come about money.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.360
True,

15:29.362 --> 15:32.196
and at the time,
it seemed sensible

15:32.198 --> 15:34.098
to take out a small mortgage
on the farm

15:34.100 --> 15:35.466
when things got tough,

15:35.468 --> 15:36.567
and when they got tougher,

15:36.569 --> 15:38.102
he took out
a second,

15:38.104 --> 15:39.704
and then your grandma
got sick...

15:39.706 --> 15:40.972
Well, he just
always thought

15:40.974 --> 15:42.507
he'd catch up.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.341
How much?

15:43.343 --> 15:45.109
75,000.

back to Seattle.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.519

15:54.521 --> 15:56.721
Okay, how much
time do I have

15:56.723 --> 15:58.222
to come up with
the money?

15:58.224 --> 16:00.224
Well, the notes
come due in November,

16:00.226 --> 16:02.160
and then if it isn't dealt with
by the end of the year,

16:02.162 --> 16:03.528
the bank will foreclose.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.597
I can take the equity
out of my condo,

16:06.599 --> 16:08.266
but that still won't even
come close.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.501
Who is the bank manager
around here?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.636
Kyle finster.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.971
He's also the mayor.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.172
Perfect.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.140
I will talk to him
first thing tomorrow.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.643
He's out on the front porch
stuffing his face.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.212
You don't sound
too fond of him.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.313
Let's just say

16:22.315 --> 16:24.382
that finster never
dipped his toes

16:24.384 --> 16:26.651
in the milk
of human kindness.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.253
I'm sure that
i can reason with him.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.456
Well, you would be
the first.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.557
So, mayor finster,

16:32.559 --> 16:34.058
I'm sure you can see

16:34.060 --> 16:36.527
how counter-productive
it would be to foreclose.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.062
I may need
a bit of time,

16:38.064 --> 16:39.697
but I'm sure I'll find
the right buyer.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.467
Oh, we already found
the right buyer.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.534
You do?
Who is it?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.036
Well, I'm not
at Liberty to say,

16:45.038 --> 16:46.237
but let me assure you,

16:46.239 --> 16:47.605
it all comes under the umbrella

16:47.607 --> 16:50.174
of the growth incentive
for our fair town.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.576
I have a feeling

16:51.578 --> 16:53.611
we're not talking about
a local farmer.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.147
Well, I did say
"growth incentive."

that sort of thing?

17:01.054 --> 17:02.387
Exactly.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.790
Well, the bank can't
do anything

17:05.791 --> 17:07.157
until November, right?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.193
Oh, it'll be here
before you know it.

if I do.

Okay, but we're
on the radio.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.929

I'll speak
literally.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.269

doesn't consist of

we're aiming for,

You're being
reassigned...

20:13.279 --> 20:14.478
Reassigned?

20:14.480 --> 20:17.348
Yeah, to "green
is the new black."

20:17.350 --> 20:18.783
Okay, what is that?

20:18.785 --> 20:20.685
It's the program
that was formerly titled

20:20.687 --> 20:22.753
"the garden gal."

20:22.755 --> 20:25.323
You mean that really
boring gardening show

20:25.325 --> 20:26.958
that no one listens to?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.461
But we're going to bring it
into the 21st century.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.596
Our market research
indicates

20:31.598 --> 20:34.599
is very popular
with the younger demo.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.834
I-i don't know anything
about gardening.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.402
Well, you didn't know
anything about Seattle

20:38.404 --> 20:39.503
when you got here,

20:39.505 --> 20:40.938
but you figured that out
for the "pulse."

20:40.940 --> 20:42.273
This is ridiculous.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.674
I won't do it.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.376
I have an iron-clad
three-year contract.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.844
Your contract
is with the station,

20:46.846 --> 20:47.912
not the program.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.014
We're
reassigning you.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.383
Oh, that sounds like
a terrific plan.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.519
Let's just force your
on-air talent to do a show.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.989
I mean, I might as well
broadcast from my tractor.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.958
You own a tractor?

21:00.960 --> 21:04.662
Uh, technically, yeah,
on my farm.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.697
You have a farm?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.766
Temporarily, yes.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.667
That's perfect!

21:09.669 --> 21:11.869
That's the angle
I've been looking for.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.638
We'll broadcast from your farm!

21:13.640 --> 21:16.440
Oh, it's not in the middle
of nowhere, is it?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.776
Um, it's where farms tend to be,
out in the country.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.311
Where exactly?

21:20.313 --> 21:21.846
About three hours from here--

21:21.848 --> 21:22.813
that's beyond perfect!

21:22.815 --> 21:25.449
So that the fans can watch it
on their computer!

21:25.451 --> 21:26.784
18-to-24 year olds
will love it!

21:26.786 --> 21:29.320
You'll be like Rachael ray,

21:29.322 --> 21:30.521
except on the radio,

21:30.523 --> 21:31.722
and not as peppy.

21:31.724 --> 21:35.459
Okay, let's just hold on
for a second here, all right?

21:35.461 --> 21:37.728
You literally
just thought of this idea

21:37.730 --> 21:38.863
two seconds ago.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.298
I mean, it's not
a done deal,

21:40.300 --> 21:41.365
right?

21:41.367 --> 21:42.867
Of course not.
I'm not insane.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.335
Thank god.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.569
For a second there
i thought that--

21:45.571 --> 21:47.071
we'll do a test
run of six months.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.840
Broadcast twice in a week,

21:49.842 --> 21:52.310
and syndication
all across the country.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.413
Okay, you have to be joking.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.881
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.349
Go, go back
to your little farm.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.850
Get busy.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.454
We'll do a trial run
on Wednesday,

22:03.456 --> 22:05.456
and broadcast on Saturday.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.590
Ta ta!

22:18.570 --> 22:19.870
You're putting
a webcam in the house?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.906
Nobody said anything
about inside the house.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.374
Take it up
with management.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.476
[Sighs heavily]

22:25.478 --> 22:27.878
Okay, where are
the others?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.448
Well, there's one
right there,

22:30.450 --> 22:31.549
one up there,

22:31.551 --> 22:32.616
and another one
over there,

22:32.618 --> 22:33.884
and we've got
three outside.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.653
Now, they're all
placed and activated

22:35.655 --> 22:37.822
to pick up anything you do
within a hundred yards.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.359
So anybody with a computer
can just tune in and watch?

22:41.361 --> 22:42.860
Kind of creepy, huh?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.895
Extremely.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.764
All right, well,
here's a rig

22:46.766 --> 22:48.499
in case you need to do
a remote broadcast,

22:48.501 --> 22:51.001
and, uh, good luck
with your show tomorrow.

23:16.728 --> 23:20.931
This just gets
better and better.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.833
[Sighs heavily]

23:28.807 --> 23:30.975
[Marching band plays]

23:30.977 --> 23:34.578
[♪]

23:52.831 --> 23:53.831
Get your Bobby's blended!

23:53.833 --> 23:57.902
It's a magical blend
of ingredients for you, sir!

23:57.904 --> 23:59.437
Well, hello.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.038
Uh, hey... Bobby.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.773
So, what's going on?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.909
This is
the pumpkin parade.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.710
[With mock drama]:
Be well, Emma!

24:09.581 --> 24:10.948
Hey...

24:10.950 --> 24:12.616
So you, uh,
change your mind

24:12.618 --> 24:14.685
about the, uh,
pumpkin seeds yet?

24:14.687 --> 24:16.487
What is it with you
and the seeds?

24:16.489 --> 24:17.955
The mighty muffler
chain is opening,

24:17.957 --> 24:21.892
so I need to open
my own shop to compete.

24:21.894 --> 24:26.497
To open my own shop
here on main street.

24:26.499 --> 24:27.832
That's your
business plan?

24:27.834 --> 24:28.833
A pumpkin?

24:28.835 --> 24:29.834
Uh, Seth, Seth...

24:29.836 --> 24:31.869
Seth, sorry,
my lawn mower's starter--

24:31.871 --> 24:32.937
hey, whoa, whoa,
hold on a sec.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.839
Emma, I will give you $200

24:34.841 --> 24:35.906
for one pumpkin seed.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.007
Huh?
think about it.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.542
Think about it,
200 bucks.

24:38.544 --> 24:39.677
Emma!

24:39.679 --> 24:40.811
Ooh!

24:40.813 --> 24:42.813
Get your skinny
butt over here...

24:42.815 --> 24:44.849
I just got back
from Seattle.

24:44.851 --> 24:48.953
Any of you think you can grow
a big pumpkin this year?

24:48.955 --> 24:51.822
[Loud cheering]

24:51.824 --> 24:55.860
Now, I mean a big,
orange, monstrous gourd!

24:55.862 --> 24:57.561
[Cheering]

24:57.563 --> 24:58.762
A pumpkin so big

24:58.764 --> 25:00.764
that when people see it,

25:00.766 --> 25:02.766
they will hide their children

25:02.768 --> 25:04.902
and scream for their mommas!

25:04.904 --> 25:06.904
I've been hearing
that same speech

25:06.906 --> 25:07.905
all my life,

25:07.907 --> 25:09.840
and it still
gives me the chills.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.843
And how many of you
really speak pumpkin?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.144
[Cheering]

25:14.146 --> 25:15.579
Who is this guy?

25:15.581 --> 25:16.714
Al, one of
the original

25:16.716 --> 25:17.748
big pumpkin growers,

25:17.750 --> 25:18.883
along with
your granddad.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.819
During the contest,
keeping things kosher.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.053
This is a great day
for your town,

25:23.055 --> 25:25.789
but it's also a day

25:25.791 --> 25:29.793
to remember someone
who was close to our hearts.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.996
Walt silver.

25:31.998 --> 25:36.934
Now, Walt was a hell
of a pumpkin grower.

25:36.936 --> 25:37.968
[Cheering and applause]

25:37.970 --> 25:40.004
But most of all,

25:40.006 --> 25:43.674
he was a good friend
to all of us.

25:43.676 --> 25:46.010
So I would like

25:46.012 --> 25:47.778
to dedicate
this year's contest

25:47.780 --> 25:50.080
to Walt silver!

25:50.082 --> 25:52.983
[Cheering and applause]

25:54.886 --> 25:57.988
And Walt must be
smiling down on us,

25:57.990 --> 25:59.924
because this year's winner

25:59.926 --> 26:02.693
will go home...

26:02.695 --> 26:04.895
With this!

26:04.897 --> 26:06.830
$25,000?

26:06.832 --> 26:08.098
I like the sound of that.

26:08.100 --> 26:13.904
The pumpkin almanac
will double the $25,000

26:13.906 --> 26:16.674
if anyone beats the world record

26:16.676 --> 26:20.844
of 1,878 pounds!

26:20.846 --> 26:23.013
[Cheering and applause]

26:23.915 --> 26:25.916
$50,000?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.117
I'd like to get
my hands on that.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.118
I'll say.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.019
Yeah, dream on,
sweetheart.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.221
Are you ready?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.890
[All cheering]: Yeah!

26:32.892 --> 26:34.825
Ten...

26:34.827 --> 26:36.961
[All chanting]:
Nine, eight, seven...

26:36.963 --> 26:39.964
Six, five...

26:39.966 --> 26:41.832
Four, three...

26:41.834 --> 26:43.801
Two, one!

26:43.803 --> 26:45.135
[Cheering]

26:48.773 --> 26:51.742
I can do this.
It's in my genes.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.978
What is?

26:53.980 --> 26:55.779
I am going to grow
a giant pumpkin

26:55.781 --> 26:57.848
and collect
that prize money.

27:05.857 --> 27:08.025
This is like reading Chinese,

27:08.027 --> 27:08.859
underwater,

27:08.861 --> 27:11.295
with a blindfold on...

27:11.297 --> 27:13.130
[Sighs heavily]

27:13.132 --> 27:15.733
[Knock on door]

27:15.735 --> 27:16.800
Who is it?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.902
It's your neighbor!

27:18.904 --> 27:21.005
Seth Cullen!

27:21.007 --> 27:22.940
I pre-announced myself
with a knock,

27:22.942 --> 27:26.043
followed by a friendly exchange
of pleasantries.

27:27.712 --> 27:29.113
I'll let
myself in.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.949
Of course you will.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.187
So, uh,

27:37.189 --> 27:39.089
if you are here about the seeds,
the answer is still no.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.991
A-ha.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.260
Well, I found this
by your mailbox.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.728
It's got a Seattle postmark.

27:44.730 --> 27:45.829
Ooh, great.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.164
I've been
waiting for this.

27:47.166 --> 27:51.802
I see you're adjusting
to the country life.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.303
Oh, and I saw
the trucks outside.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.905
What are you doing,
a reality show

27:54.907 --> 27:55.906
or something
like that?

27:55.908 --> 27:57.875
Survivor,
valleyville?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.943
I'm broadcasting
my radio program

27:59.945 --> 28:01.245
from the farm.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.880
Oh, nice.

28:02.882 --> 28:03.914
What are you
going to talk about?

28:03.916 --> 28:06.917
Oh, the earth...

28:06.919 --> 28:08.118
Flowers...

28:08.120 --> 28:10.154
Animals, growing things.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.922
I see,

28:11.924 --> 28:13.791
and do you know anything
about those things?

28:13.793 --> 28:15.359
Yes.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.127
You know,
it's been really lovely

28:17.129 --> 28:18.796
chatting with you like this,

28:18.798 --> 28:20.998
but I've got to get back to,
you know...

28:21.000 --> 28:21.932
Okay.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.735
Okay, 300 apiece.

28:24.737 --> 28:25.369
What?

28:25.371 --> 28:29.139
Like I said before,
they aren't for sale.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.974
Besides, I need them.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.009
For what?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.877
Well, I'm
going to enter

28:33.879 --> 28:36.914
the growing pumpkin
contest myself.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.115
Why in the world
would <i>you</i>

28:38.117 --> 28:39.917
want to do that?

28:39.919 --> 28:41.919
Because I like challenges.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.220
Oh, you like challenges.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.356
All right, let me just make sure
i got this straight.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.959
You are going to plant those
little seeds in the ground,

28:48.961 --> 28:50.094
you're going to nurture
them, protect them,

28:50.096 --> 28:51.795
watch them grow
to unbelievable sizes,

28:51.797 --> 28:52.930
and then you're going to
haul them off

28:52.932 --> 28:53.931
to the contest,
is that it?

28:53.933 --> 28:55.132
Is that your plan?

28:55.134 --> 28:57.835
Yes, and i
intend to win.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.204
And you thought my
business plan was flawed.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.371
Right, well,

29:01.373 --> 29:03.440
it was really nice
speaking with you.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.908
Hey, my pleasure.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.311
To hear what you have to say
on your radio show

29:07.313 --> 29:09.012
about growing things.

29:09.014 --> 29:09.980
Should be very educational.

40:10.409 --> 40:15.912
where I will be transplanting
my little plants

40:15.914 --> 40:18.448
<i>any day now,</i>

40:18.450 --> 40:20.717
<i>somewhere right around...</i>

40:20.719 --> 40:22.018
Here!

40:22.987 --> 40:24.888
All right, this is Emma silver,

40:24.890 --> 40:25.822
reminding you
to smell the coffee,

40:25.824 --> 40:27.957
drive carefully,

40:27.959 --> 40:29.893
and, of course,
join us next time.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.895
<i>Bye!</i>

40:43.207 --> 40:44.541
Hey, Seth!

40:44.543 --> 40:45.642
Hey, Bobby.

40:45.644 --> 40:46.776
I'm taking a load
of my special blend

40:46.778 --> 40:47.944
over to Emma's.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.979
Well, I'm sure
she'll be appreciative.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.215
Yeah, well,
it's been forever

40:52.217 --> 40:53.817
since we had
any sophistication

40:53.819 --> 40:56.820
so I want to impress her
with the good stuff.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.588
Right.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.624
Well, if a truckload of manure
won't do it, Bobby,

41:01.626 --> 41:02.892
I don't know what will.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.060
Thanks, buddy!

41:04.062 --> 41:06.996
Good luck.

41:26.617 --> 41:27.884
Hey, Bobby,
what have you got there?

41:27.886 --> 41:30.019
Well, I have
a surprise for you.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.554
I love surprises.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.723
Well, then, you are
going to love this.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.558
This is
Bobby's blend supreme.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.894
And I throw in a little
bit of bat guano

41:37.896 --> 41:39.996
to give it
that extra kick.

41:39.998 --> 41:40.864
That's great.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.500
You don't have to worry
about it or anything.

41:43.502 --> 41:45.969
I left a big old pile of it
in my living room

41:45.971 --> 41:49.939
and there wasn't even
a trace of toxicity or stench.

41:49.941 --> 41:50.974
Mmm...

41:50.976 --> 41:52.909
[Inhaling]

41:52.911 --> 41:53.977
Wow.

41:53.979 --> 41:56.513
That is just
so nice of you.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.580
[Chuckling]:
yeah...

41:57.582 --> 41:58.882
It's all for you.

41:58.884 --> 41:59.916
[Chuckles
awkwardly]

41:59.918 --> 42:01.818
Thanks.

42:05.756 --> 42:06.823
[Chuckles]

42:06.825 --> 42:09.759
Now, that
is romantic.

42:09.761 --> 42:12.095
I see Bobby brought
you his gift.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.997
Yeah, uh...

42:13.999 --> 42:17.000
What am I supposed
to do with it?

42:17.002 --> 42:18.935
I can think of
a few things.

42:18.937 --> 42:21.604
Walt tilled it into
the ground, though.

42:21.606 --> 42:22.839
Oh...

42:22.841 --> 42:24.741
Uh, how?

42:24.743 --> 42:26.009
With his tiller.

42:26.011 --> 42:29.078
It's in the shed.

42:34.919 --> 42:37.654
[Struggling]

42:38.789 --> 42:40.857
You know...

42:40.859 --> 42:42.926
It's probably
out of gas.

42:42.928 --> 42:44.827
You knew
it was out of gas!

42:44.829 --> 42:46.796
I suspected.
Big difference,

42:46.798 --> 42:47.997
but I'll
tell you what.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.566
I'll start it
for you.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.801
Then all you
got to do is steer.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.970
The tiller
will do the rest, hmm?

42:53.972 --> 42:55.638
Oh, and, uh...

42:55.640 --> 42:57.040
Don't let the cameras
make you nervous.

42:58.943 --> 43:00.843
Although...

43:00.845 --> 43:02.078
My offer still stands.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.880
You want to partner up,

43:03.882 --> 43:05.949
I'll take care of
all the machinery,

43:05.951 --> 43:08.985
the tiller, tractor,
all that stuff.

43:09.887 --> 43:12.055
Partnering up as in
splitting the prize money?

43:12.057 --> 43:13.890
Yeah, that sounds fair to me.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.658
Not interested.

43:15.660 --> 43:16.960
Besides,
i don't really need you.

43:16.962 --> 43:19.095
I have secret
growing information.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.864
Uh-huh, yeah,
I'm sure you do.

43:21.866 --> 43:24.000
Okay...

43:24.002 --> 43:26.135
[Tiller engine roars to life]

43:26.137 --> 43:26.970
[Shrieks]

43:26.972 --> 43:27.971
You're doing great!

43:30.107 --> 43:31.140
Ooh...

43:31.142 --> 43:32.675
[Groans]

43:32.677 --> 43:35.645
Oh, you broke
the casing.

43:35.647 --> 43:36.813
You bent the blades,

43:36.815 --> 43:38.147
you broke
the fuel line,

43:38.149 --> 43:39.983
not to mention
the fence.

43:39.985 --> 43:43.019
No, I'm fine, it's okay,
thank you for asking.

43:43.021 --> 43:44.687
[Sighs]

43:44.689 --> 43:47.023
Come on, face it,
you do need me.

43:47.025 --> 43:47.857
So, are we going to
partner up or what?

43:47.859 --> 43:49.926
Ugh, over my dead body.

43:49.928 --> 43:50.927
[Laughs]

43:50.929 --> 43:54.097
I don't think that's
going to take very long...

43:56.066 --> 43:57.200
I'll get the tiller!

43:57.202 --> 43:58.868
Come on, Marie.

43:58.870 --> 44:01.137
No, they won't.
I'm bringing the beer.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.905
You play
poker, Emma?

44:02.907 --> 44:04.907
I know my way
around a deck.

44:06.076 --> 44:07.777
Brought
some new blood.

44:07.779 --> 44:09.178
Hey, everyone.

44:09.180 --> 44:13.016
You know, if you play
the way you till,

44:13.018 --> 44:14.851
this could make for

44:14.853 --> 44:16.052
a very interesting evening.

44:16.054 --> 44:17.120
No, come on in, join us.

44:17.122 --> 44:19.055
Please.

44:19.057 --> 44:20.957
Uh-huh.

44:27.197 --> 44:28.931
Ah, I fold.

44:28.933 --> 44:30.800
This brie
is heaven, Emma.

44:30.802 --> 44:31.868
Not as good
as the gouda, though.

44:31.870 --> 44:35.071
Only thing you know
about cheese is cutting it.

44:35.073 --> 44:37.140
Okay, that's enough, boys.

44:37.142 --> 44:39.075
I'm out.

44:39.077 --> 44:41.010
Okay, slick,

44:41.012 --> 44:42.011
I will raise you...

44:42.013 --> 44:43.880
Two.

44:43.882 --> 44:45.848
I re-raise you...

44:45.850 --> 44:47.984
Two.

44:47.986 --> 44:51.020
Well, you know
what they say...

44:51.022 --> 44:52.188
I'm out.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.257
[Laughing]

44:54.259 --> 44:57.794
All right, call.

44:57.796 --> 44:59.195
Okay,
let's see--

44:59.197 --> 45:00.730
ah!

45:00.732 --> 45:01.898
Oh, she got
you, buddy!

45:01.900 --> 45:03.332
Oh, got smoked, huh?

45:03.334 --> 45:04.834
Our city girl knows
what she's doing.

45:04.836 --> 45:07.170
Yeah, well, I paid
most of my college tuition

45:07.172 --> 45:08.871
from playing poker.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.006
That's funny,

45:10.008 --> 45:11.841
'cause I spent most
of my time studying.

45:11.843 --> 45:13.009
You went to college?

45:13.011 --> 45:15.011
Yeah, I went
to college.

45:15.013 --> 45:15.878
Stanford.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.013
Engineering,
actually.

45:17.015 --> 45:19.015
- Really?
- mm-hm.

45:19.017 --> 45:21.818
I would think
that a Stanford man

45:21.820 --> 45:23.219
would play smarter.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.353
[Laughter]

45:24.355 --> 45:26.289
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:26.291 --> 45:27.990
Just deal,
it's not that funny.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.225
Wasn't that funny...

45:29.227 --> 45:31.928
[♪]

45:36.900 --> 45:39.802
All right,
you two,

45:39.804 --> 45:41.871
what about me?

45:41.873 --> 45:43.306
I know you're bluffing.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.241
You do?

45:47.377 --> 45:49.245
I'm out.

45:49.247 --> 45:51.047
You know, you should
probably fold too.

45:54.952 --> 45:56.819
I raise you four.

45:56.821 --> 45:58.221
Four?

45:58.223 --> 45:59.989
Hmm...

45:59.991 --> 46:01.290
Tell you what,

46:01.292 --> 46:02.992
you want to make this
real interesting?

46:02.994 --> 46:05.027
What do you have in mind?

46:05.029 --> 46:07.096
I win this hand,

46:07.098 --> 46:08.898
you and me...

46:08.900 --> 46:10.266
Pumpkin-growing partners.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.001
Hmm?

46:12.003 --> 46:14.403
[Chuckling and groaning
knowingly]

46:14.405 --> 46:16.973
And if I win,

46:16.975 --> 46:18.374
you do all of my tractor work,

46:18.376 --> 46:20.409
my tilling,

46:20.411 --> 46:21.444
and all
the heavy lifting.

46:21.446 --> 46:24.013
No charge, of course.

46:24.015 --> 46:26.048
[Laughing]

46:29.353 --> 46:31.454
Yeah, okay,
I'm in.

46:31.456 --> 46:33.022
Let's see what you got.

46:33.024 --> 46:35.057
Full house,

46:35.059 --> 46:36.459
Jacks over kings.

46:36.461 --> 46:39.428
Ohh...

46:39.430 --> 46:41.964
Somebody's working.

46:41.966 --> 46:42.999
That, uh...

46:43.001 --> 46:45.001
That's a really
good hand, yeah.

46:45.003 --> 46:46.068
I have...

46:46.070 --> 46:47.170
I have two pair.

46:47.172 --> 46:49.906
I have a pair
of black eights,

46:49.908 --> 46:51.908
and I have this pair
of red eights.

46:51.910 --> 46:54.477
[Everyone chuckles]

46:56.914 --> 46:59.916
Well, I guess
that does it...

46:59.918 --> 47:01.384
I'll see you
at sunrise, partner.

47:01.386 --> 47:03.486
[Laughter]

47:04.454 --> 47:06.956
Nice, nice...

47:06.958 --> 47:08.191
Emma, always a pleasure.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.231
We are back with
another broadcast

47:15.233 --> 47:16.999
from pumpkin central.

47:17.001 --> 47:21.070
Now, so far,
we have tilled the soil,

47:21.072 --> 47:24.006
and we have transplanted
our seedlings,

47:24.008 --> 47:27.376
so, the lines are open.

47:27.378 --> 47:30.379
Do you have
a pumpkin question for me?

47:30.381 --> 47:32.081
[Woman]: <i>no, I have one</i>
<i>for your partner, though.</i>

47:32.083 --> 47:36.118
Uh, you know what, I'm sorry,
but he's not available.

47:36.120 --> 47:38.521
[Woman]: <i>I can see him</i>
<i>right behind you!</i>

47:42.259 --> 47:43.459
[Woman]:
<i>this is really important.</i>

47:43.461 --> 47:45.294
Seth?

47:45.296 --> 47:46.429
Mm-hm?

47:46.431 --> 47:48.231
Someone needs to talk to you.

47:48.233 --> 47:51.167
Cool.

47:51.169 --> 47:53.135
All right.

47:55.005 --> 47:57.540
Just put these on, huh?

47:57.542 --> 47:59.475
Mm-hm.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.143
Uh, hello?

48:01.145 --> 48:03.045
How can I help you?

48:03.047 --> 48:05.314
[Woman]: <i>my girlfriends and I</i>
<i>think you're hot!</i>

48:05.316 --> 48:06.449
[Laughs]

48:06.451 --> 48:09.118
Uh, well, thank you.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.320
<i>And we'd like to know</i>
<i>if you're single.</i>

48:11.322 --> 48:13.055
That is not
a pumpkin question.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.892
Why, yes, actually,
i am single.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.193
<i>We think you have sexy eyes.</i>

48:17.195 --> 48:19.028
[Scoffing]:
oh, please.

48:19.030 --> 48:19.996
He does not.

48:19.998 --> 48:21.063
<i>How can you say that?</i>

48:21.065 --> 48:24.333
Because I am
sitting right here

48:24.335 --> 48:25.368
looking at him,

48:25.370 --> 48:28.004
and he is...

48:29.373 --> 48:32.141
Average.

48:32.143 --> 48:33.576
At best.

48:33.578 --> 48:36.045
<i>[Woman]: you must be blind.</i>

48:36.047 --> 48:38.614
Okay, do you have
a pumpkin question?

48:38.616 --> 48:40.082
<i>Seth, call me at 978--</i>

48:40.084 --> 48:41.317
[click]

48:41.319 --> 48:43.286
Hey! that was rude.
She was nice.

48:43.288 --> 48:44.587
Get dates
on your own time.

48:44.589 --> 48:45.621
Okay.

48:45.623 --> 48:47.356
Caller two,
you're on the air.

48:47.358 --> 48:49.191
<i>Hi, Emma, it's Bobby.</i>

48:49.193 --> 48:50.326
Hey, Bobby.

48:50.328 --> 48:51.427
Do you have
a question?

48:51.429 --> 48:53.262
Yes, I do.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.530
Are you free for dinner?

49:02.506 --> 49:03.673
What are those?

49:05.475 --> 49:07.576
Oh, uh, hey...

49:07.578 --> 49:09.712
Greenhouses.

49:09.714 --> 49:13.249
Yeah, the journal says that

49:13.251 --> 49:14.717
"she enjoys
gentle breezes

49:14.719 --> 49:17.019
and summer days."

49:17.021 --> 49:21.090
Well, I put a fan
in each of the greenhouses

49:21.092 --> 49:24.060
and each house maintains
a constant 85 degrees--

49:24.062 --> 49:26.629
a nice summer day
temperature.

49:26.631 --> 49:30.032
I guess that makes sense.

49:30.034 --> 49:31.434
Okay, where are you going
in that dress?

49:31.436 --> 49:35.438
I'm, uh, going to dinner
with Bobby.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.406
Oh. okay--

49:37.408 --> 49:39.375
uh, yeah...
But I actually need you

49:39.377 --> 49:41.143
to help me
with these.

49:41.145 --> 49:42.511
Okay, I'll help you tomorrow.

49:42.513 --> 49:43.546
Okay.

49:43.548 --> 49:44.747
Okay, no, that's great.

49:44.749 --> 49:46.082
I mean, if you want to
chance the coyotes

49:46.084 --> 49:47.683
getting at
the crop tonight.

49:47.685 --> 49:48.751
Coyotes?

49:48.753 --> 49:50.052
Yeah.

49:50.054 --> 49:56.025

Well, um, reel's ready.

01:00:29.927 --> 01:00:30.892
Let's watch some more movie.

01:00:30.894 --> 01:00:34.997
Okay, be prepared...

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:38.133
To be entertained.

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.074
<i>Now, please, John,</i>

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.677
<i>you won't let me down,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:50.946
<i>Mother says</i>
<i>good luck, too.</i>

01:00:50.948 --> 01:00:53.915
<i>Please, please believe</i>
<i>every word of it.</i>

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:56.084
<i>He turned out to be</i>
<i>a wonderful person, John.</i>

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:58.854
<i>John Doe,</i>
<i>the one in the speech.</i>

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:02.824
<i>I've actually</i>
<i>fallen in love with him.</i>

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:06.962
Okay, the ac is off,

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:09.064
so I'm interviewing
valleyville's

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:11.299
pumpkin widow support group

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.769
here at Marie's general store.

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.003
So how was
movie night?

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.271
[Giggling]

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:17.873
Uh, Marie,
this is a gardening show.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.042
Okay, so I'll
rephrase that.

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:24.713
Um, did anything bloom
in that barn last night?

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:25.914
[Giggling]

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.783
Uh, so, uh,

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:28.917
can you ladies
tell me

01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:30.986
what you talk about
while you meet?

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.187
Oh, well, basically

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.855
just complain
about our men.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:34.890
At least Jeff lets
you in the patch.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.792
Yeah, Hank's got his
electrified

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:40.095
<i>I have to toss his lunch</i>
<i>over the fence!</i>

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:42.130
This time of year,

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:43.165
Russell's completely
lost interest in me.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:45.934
For the orange hotties
in the garden.

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:48.003
Really?

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.939
We haven't been on a
vacation in 10 years.

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:52.140
Hank took the blanket
off our bed

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:54.843
<i>and put it on his pumpkin.</i>

01:01:54.845 --> 01:02:00.215
Men, do you hear
what your women are saying?

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.783
Shame on you.

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:02.851
Yeah.

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:03.952
Yeah.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.156
So, guess what,

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:09.958
Hank and Russell
have invited us

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.259
on a stealth run.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.095
What's a stealth run?

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:14.996
That's when you sneak
into a farmer's patch

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:15.931
to find out
his secrets.

01:02:15.933 --> 01:02:17.032
Now, I said no,

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:19.000
because these things
always turn out bad.

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:20.869
Who were they
going to go spy on?

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.938
Ah, our not-so-honorable
mayor finster.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.807
Apparently his pumpkins
are already 1,000 pounds.

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:28.043
1,000 pounds?
We have to go.

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:30.011
Hey, I'm trying to be
the voice of reason here.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.279
Yeah, well, tell that
to mighty muffler.

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:32.380
Let's go.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:33.949
Good point.

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.820
So, what's the plan?

01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:39.921
All right, finster's
at a christening--

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.123
no, no, no,
it's a wedding.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.324
He'll be back
in an hour.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.792
Fine.

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:44.826
So, I'm going to
wait in the truck.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:45.927
I'll be the look-out--

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.329
it's my truck.
I stay in the truck.

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.997
Hank, you'll
fall asleep.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:51.833
All right, we got to
sneak around the side,

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:54.102
because he's got
surveillance.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.252
Hit the deck!

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.057
Now!

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.003
[Laughing]

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:29.871
Look at you,
crawling in the dirt.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:30.972
[Cell phone rings]

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:32.174
Keep going.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:34.042
Yeah, i-i heard you
on Emma's show.

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:36.344
I'm sorry, honey.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:38.947
Look, I'll take you
on a cruise, I promise.

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:40.882
Gotta go.

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:41.983
Look at that.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:44.052
Let's go check out his barn,

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:45.020
see what he's using.

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:46.188
All right.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.322
Now!

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:01.036
He's got nothing but
Bobby's blend here.

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:10.111
[Snoring]

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:12.113
I didn't know
finster had a Harley.

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:13.248
Really?

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.885
[Gasps]: wow...

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:18.186
That's a '91 heritage!

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.055
[Gushing
and raving]

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:21.423
Kitty...

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:22.991
Kitty?

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:24.092
[Clucks to cat]

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:25.360
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.362
Kitty?

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.099
[Bangs on hood,
Hank snoring loudly]

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.034
Hank!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.236
[Splutters awake]

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:35.470
What are you
doing here?

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.105
Mayor?

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:38.106
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:44.546
Hey! hey!

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:45.981
Nobody move!

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:46.948
Go, go, go!

[Screaming in horror]

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.417
Hey!

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:51.019
Don't think I don't see you!

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:55.023
Seth Cullen,
i see you running!

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:56.124
You too, Russell!

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.294
Wait for me!

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:00.495
Ew!

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:01.596
Oh, stay away!

01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:03.031
I stink!

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:04.432
Yeah,
i noticed!

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:09.037
Come on...

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.441
Hey! hey!

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:16.544
I'm sorry!

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:18.380
Come on!

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:20.048
Oh, man!

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:21.016
How can you mistake a skunk
for a cat?

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.150
I don't know.

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:24.052
All I know is that
everything I do

01:05:24.054 --> 01:05:25.186
ends up with me stinking.

01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:26.254
Ugh...

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.389
What are you doing?

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:29.591
Moving upwind.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:30.926
Look, I told you.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:32.527
I told you this always
ends badly--

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:35.130
if I had known
there were going to be skunks.

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.131
What are you
looking for?

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.165
My wipes.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:38.934
Oh, you are
way past wipes.

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:40.468
And this, this is
just great.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.171
Better and better.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:44.239
Holy Moses!

01:05:44.241 --> 01:05:45.373
Who got hit?

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.709
Arrest
these two!

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.344
Oh, come on, it was
just a stealth run.

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:50.545
What's the big deal?

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.081
It was
trespassing.

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.983
All right, someone needs
to take me home.

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:56.217
You get in my vehicle,
and I will arrest you.

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:57.452
I want these two
prosecuted

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.620
to the full extent
of the law.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.360
Come on, you got to be
joking me.

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:08.196
I'm pulling you guys
out of pumpkin patches?

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:11.099
As far as I'm concerned,
she can go free.

01:06:11.101 --> 01:06:13.268
She's not stinking up my jail.

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:15.637
Whoa! jeez...

All right, Kate, it is late,

01:06:29.086 --> 01:06:31.653
and I have had
a hell of a day, so--

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.727
really?

01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:40.095
[Chuckles]

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:42.497
You're kidding me.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:46.001
Well, yeah, I mean,
of course I'll be there.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.103
[Chuckles]

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:50.071
Um...

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.073
Yeah, I'll ask.

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:01.483
Thanks for the ride.

01:07:01.485 --> 01:07:02.484
Well, well, well.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.454
Is it safe to approach?

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:08.256
If you like
tomato juice.

01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:11.226
So how was
your night in jail?

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:13.094
Well, other than
having to fix two CBS,

01:07:13.096 --> 01:07:14.763
a scanner, and a coffee maker,

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:16.131
it was very relaxing, actually.

01:07:16.133 --> 01:07:17.599
Well, you won't have
to fix anything

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:19.667
at the four seasons.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.102
What?

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:22.404
The station called,

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:25.473

tomorrow in Seattle,

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:34.382
and a big party
afterwards

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:35.450
at the hotel.

01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:37.118

My boss wants me to bring you.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.691
Good publicity,
and, well,

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:45.393
there is a free dinner.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.328
Well, I never turn down
a free dinner.

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:49.097
So you'll go.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:51.066
Well, that depends.

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:52.200

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:56.805
Are you asking,
or is your boss?

01:07:56.807 --> 01:08:00.175
Um... I'm asking.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.743
Then yes.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:04.646
Excellent.
so it's a date.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:05.713
Sort of.

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:06.848
[Laughs]

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.818
"Sort of" works
just fine for me.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.186
Okay, then.

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:12.654
Okay.

he'll be here soon.

fell off the tractor.

Right this way.

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:49.756
This should
make you feel

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.893

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.270
Very nice touch.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:05.807

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:23.224
Hi, this is Emma silver.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:25.460
When I left Seattle
for a life on the farm,

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:28.462
I thought that I would die
without my lattes,

01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:29.497
the bright lights

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.799
and the heartbeat
of the city.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:35.904
Lattes are just
coffee with milk,

01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:38.573
and the stars in the country

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:40.875
outshine every light
in the city

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.444
without even trying.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.345
<i>As for that heartbeat?</i>

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:48.349
<i>Well, I learned that it lies</i>

The people of valleyville

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:54.189
are the most Sincere people
that I have ever met,

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:57.625
especially my giant
pumpkin growing partner,

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:02.964
who gives all-new meaning
to "growing the big one."

01:10:02.966 --> 01:10:04.732
And...cut!

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.768
That's a keeper.

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:07.969
Excuse me.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:09.470
Wow.

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:10.538
[Laughs]: wow...

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.508

Every word.

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:16.511

a face for TV,

01:10:21.952 --> 01:10:23.218
Oh, thank you.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.485
Uh, this is Seth--

So I guess your dreams
are coming true, huh?

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.270
Yeah, I guess.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:19.574
I have to say, I'm
absolutely thrilled for you,

01:11:19.576 --> 01:11:21.542
but you will have to
get a two-bedroom place

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:22.744
because I am
coming to stay, a lot,

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:23.978
as long as it's nice,
of course...

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:40.495
Where did you
disappear to?

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:44.465
You know,
you missed a free dinner.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:47.769
I chewed on some straw
on the ride home.

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:53.574
I, uh, wish
that you had stayed.

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:54.876
You had
your hands full.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.047
Seth, I'm sorry
that I have to leave

01:11:59.049 --> 01:12:00.448

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.583
Nah, there's nothing
to be sorry for.

to do your thing.

There we go!

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:35.810
Okay, baby.

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:38.045

Sorry about
the explosion, Hank,

01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:54.161

disqualified.

our last three top competitors
have yet to weigh in.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:05.139
First,
Russell winslow's pumpkin!

[Cheering and applause]

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:22.156
That's a marvelous achievement,

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:25.993
but not quite
the world's record, folks.

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:29.964
That's okay, baby.

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:31.065

our own mayor finster!

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:41.142
You're going to
have to step back

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:43.010
so we can
weigh it.

01:19:43.012 --> 01:19:44.145

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:58.192

01:19:58.194 --> 01:20:01.295

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.063

want to say that,

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:10.037

what happens,

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:11.105

putting up with me.

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:12.239

just yesterday

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.041

Now, look at that baby!

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:18.245
What do you think
of that, folks?

01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:22.016
That is an amazing pumpkin!

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:24.051
A wonderful gourd!

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.920
Now, let me remind you

01:20:25.922 --> 01:20:32.193
that the world record
is 1,878 pounds.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:33.294
Now, silence,

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:39.033

this magnificent beast!

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.204

Well, a lot of us
were skeptical

01:21:43.299 --> 01:21:45.332
when you decided
to team up,

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:47.234
but you should be
really proud.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:50.004

Here you go.
A total of $50,000.

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:02.216
So, we hear
you're leaving us.

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:04.418
You have any message
for valleyville

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.586
before you head out?

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:11.258
Well, for once, I don't
really know what to say,

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.160
except that...

01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:16.597
From the moment I got here,
you've all made me feel at home.

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.432
This place not only
grows great pumpkins,

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:19.533
but great friends.

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:22.069
I am going to miss you all
so much.

01:22:22.071 --> 01:22:23.137
Aw...

01:22:23.139 --> 01:22:25.105

01:22:33.516 --> 01:22:34.615
Well...

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:36.317
I guess we should
get to the bank

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:37.618
so they can split up
this check.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.453
Mm-hm, right.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.255
Um, if we don't,

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:44.391
would you be able to
pay off Walt's place?

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:46.293
You know about that?

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.696
Emma, your grandfather
was the best man I ever knew.

01:22:48.698 --> 01:22:50.264
Owing money
on his land

01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:51.732
is nothing
to be ashamed of,

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:54.101
and you didn't answer
my question.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.339
If I had the whole
prize money,

01:22:58.341 --> 01:22:59.406
with the equity
from my condo,

01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:01.475
I could pay off the debt.

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.011
Okay, do it.

01:23:04.013 --> 01:23:05.379
What?

01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:07.381
You heard me.

01:23:07.383 --> 01:23:09.683
Okay, what about your shop?

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:11.185
What about mighty mufflers?

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:12.586
Uh...

01:23:12.588 --> 01:23:14.655
I have faith
in the people of this town.

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:17.124
They're not going to abandon me
for some fancy chain,

01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:18.425
at least, I hope not.

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.730
Thank you.

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:23.998
I'll pay you back.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.432

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:32.272
I think I finally realize
why you decided to stay.

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:36.276
Hmm.

Oh, thank god
that is over.

civilization, shall we?

Looks like we need to
Polish you up a bit.

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:08.742
I bet you're glad

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:11.111
to be leaving
these Hicks behind.

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.726
Wait!

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.598

What's going on?

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:35.202
We got a plane
to catch.

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:41.375
I've changed my mind.

01:24:41.377 --> 01:24:42.576
What?

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.545
I want the big pumpkin,
