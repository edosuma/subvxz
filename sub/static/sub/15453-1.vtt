No, it is not joke

03:29.838 --> 03:31.529
Oh not, Steven!

03:32.843 --> 03:35.149
Steven oh my God

03:36.652 --> 03:37.660
Are you well?

03:41.826 --> 03:43.196
No, really not

03:48.899 --> 03:50.656
It seems to be well, but... 

03:51.358 --> 03:55.050
 ... their body this so buried one
that it cannot take off

03:56.494 --> 03:57.418
That would kill him

03:57.648 --> 03:59.118
That it is supposed that he/she makes?

04:00.010 --> 04:02.102
Alone to leave to my engaged one
there buried?

04:02.358 --> 04:03.216
If

04:03.216 --> 04:07.866
But I suggest that both
return to their normal routine

04:12.256 --> 04:13.223
Don't sunbathe

04:16.581 --> 04:18.644
Do You Know Restaurant Fun?

04:18.857 --> 04:21.875
There is a show tomorrow

04:22.124 --> 04:23.435
We would rot... 

04:23.716 --> 04:24.672

04:24.885 --> 04:26.312
Pardon that you said?

04:27.130 --> 04:29.944
- Anything, did I say as these baby?
- Horrible

04:32.880 --> 04:34.701
Ok, we are to the air in 30 seconds

04:37.167 --> 04:40.122
We will marry in the house
of the beach of my parents and.

04:41.742 --> 04:44.692
If very beautiful

04:44.692 --> 04:47.170
But now it seems that it will be here

04:47.908 --> 04:49.224
If, it will be... 

04:50.183 --> 04:51.248
 ... he/she already knows, there

04:51.512 --> 04:53.728
 ... and it will be... 

04:58.103 --> 04:59.534
No, this well

05:04.384 --> 05:08.004
Ok, 5, 4, 3, 2... 

05:08.229 --> 05:12.273
Thank you Jake, I am here in
a field away from Homesdale

05:12.514 --> 05:17.634
Where Steve has been buried
in the earth the last two months

05:17.634 --> 05:21.324
I suppose that you know
that you are hero's spice

05:22.550 --> 05:25.789
You have some words for
your growing fans group?

05:26.351 --> 05:28.634
No, really not

05:30.394 --> 05:31.787
He/she is a man of few words

05:32.021 --> 05:33.624
But many followers

05:33.624 --> 05:37.815
They gather by day or at night
to have something of the one

05:38.032 --> 05:40.181
The buried Hero

05:40.181 --> 05:44.066
This Halloween will be a little
but...  under earth

05:44.766 --> 05:47.100
I Am Steven Montgomery,
if they remove me I die

05:47.303 --> 05:50.570
The Fever has begun Montgomery

05:50.570 --> 05:54.704
we will make the unemployed that that
Steven Montgomery to their body

05:55.243 --> 05:59.880
We will be buried low earth
and we will make sure that they don't move us

06:01.785 --> 06:04.317
I will be direct because
it is my style

06:04.541 --> 06:06.296
Not you are amusing

06:06.605 --> 06:09.605
With that act, never
you achieved something in this city

06:15.657 --> 06:18.094
- As they allow to enter to people as her?
- I suppose that taenia mentions

06:18.298 --> 06:19.920
- Not another time passed
- But it is worth

06:20.139 --> 06:22.205
Sr. it is Sr Montgomery
in the line 1

06:24.649 --> 06:26.288
Steven... 

06:26.288 --> 06:28.295
 ... they come and we will make a history
in the TV, what do you say?

06:36.016 --> 06:37.341
Do you never play?

06:37.341 --> 06:40.165
He/she would make it but if I make it as the other ones
as you would know that I am?

06:42.073 --> 06:44.171
- Where this Steven?
- Here, as always

06:46.038 --> 06:47.190
Hello, Steven

06:47.427 --> 06:49.789
I have two tickets for
the world series, do you want to go?

06:50.004 --> 06:52.268
No, in fact not

06:53.722 --> 06:55.980
- For that not?
- Because I cannot move, Fred

06:57.583 --> 06:59.919
If he/she made it, he/she would die

07:16.415 --> 07:19.688
We all die to know
will your character leave at some time?

07:19.927 --> 07:21.906
Not I mean a lot... 

07:22.552 --> 07:25.169
But I will say this

07:26.010 --> 07:27.860
Probably not, for obvious reasons

07:35.894 --> 07:37.899
I would have been embarrassed for two years

07:38.130 --> 07:40.827
As agent of Montgomery
all world calls me

07:40.827 --> 07:45.240
The world has changed

07:46.055 --> 07:47.173
Without moving

07:52.970 --> 07:54.135
When I began in this industry... 

07:54.355 --> 07:56.632
it is like a Trail Blazer... 

07:57.583 --> 07:59.792
I believe that it is very safe
to be in the hat of Brando

08:00.002 --> 08:02.616
America loves my things... 

08:02.616 --> 08:05.325
Steven Montgomery, hero, superestrella... 

08:05.556 --> 08:07.012
 ... God

08:07.300 --> 08:12.818
There was a tragedy in Texas when a group
of adolescents I jump intentionally of an airplane

08:13.135 --> 08:14.172
Without parachute

08:14.374 --> 08:18.144
Obviously to imitate a man
that they come as a God

08:18.787 --> 08:19.864
Steven Montgomery

08:21.861 --> 08:23.234
Turn off that shit

08:24.310 --> 08:25.215
What this happening here?

08:25.460 --> 08:27.257
Who these people are?

08:27.257 --> 08:29.211
- Not it is what you believe
- Not it is what you believe

08:29.452 --> 08:31.641
Kelly, waits

08:31.848 --> 08:33.341
He/she waits

08:34.039 --> 08:35.164
Not I can move

08:35.395 --> 08:36.794
Damned it is I cannot move

08:53.555 --> 08:55.597
Not wise to where to go

08:57.672 --> 08:58.824
This well, listen to me

09:00.074 --> 09:01.279
I will take care now of you

09:01.518 --> 09:02.594
Will you make it?

09:02.594 --> 09:03.893
Clear

09:15.596 --> 09:16.746
Ok, to the air in 5, 4, 3,

09:21.818 --> 09:25.696
That he/she has the monkey in common
with Feed Newton, anything

09:25.696 --> 09:29.841
Think again, both sometimes
they are brown

09:31.316 --> 09:34.615
Steven, I have bad news
your program has been canceled

09:35.111 --> 09:38.677
The girl that was here
taenia 16 and something happened

09:38.677 --> 09:40.258
I thought that taenia 18

09:40.929 --> 09:42.519
Not it cares, it was here

09:42.519 --> 09:45.128
- I thought that her already wise
- Not Steve cares... 

09:45.128 --> 09:49.181
-  ...  you had sex with her
- I thought that it was she "dedeando!"

09:49.181 --> 09:51.670
is the same thing, don't you understand it Steven?

09:51.880 --> 09:55.336
Shit, give me another work

09:55.587 --> 09:56.922
Not I have anything Steven

09:57.853 --> 10:01.927
Let us face it, you cannot leave
without dying

10:02.154 --> 10:04.323
I don't make the rules

10:04.962 --> 10:08.307
It is like the market is managed
I have to take this... 

10:08.533 --> 10:10.543
Hello, Johnny Franco

10:10.543 --> 10:13.396
I am blocked here
that it happens?

10:13.396 --> 10:15.948
He/she looks, you have to decide
quick, because... 

10:15.948 --> 10:18.621
At the end of the day, there won't be but... 

10:29.039 --> 10:30.559
Three years later

10:30.804 --> 10:32.734
What did it pass Steven Montgomery?

10:33.781 --> 10:36.944
In the last three years that
Steve has been outside of the air

10:37.183 --> 10:39.074
He/she chose a calm life

10:39.460 --> 10:40.606
Blocked in the earth

10:40.809 --> 10:41.991
Always

10:43.000 --> 10:44.203
Before it pleased me

10:44.428 --> 10:45.919
Now I hate it

10:47.796 --> 10:48.865
Thank you Lewis

10:49.630 --> 10:52.260
They are all the news for
tonight, I am Brein Vincent

10:52.260 --> 10:54.043
And me James Stanfold, good night

11:01.006 --> 11:01.869
Do they come like it works?

11:02.269 --> 11:04.021
It was the first and
I have nine but

11:04.286 --> 11:05.523
In total they will be 10

11:05.523 --> 11:06.755
And they know what is 10

11:07.471 --> 11:09.863
10 are...  does somebody know?

11:10.560 --> 11:13.692
It is as if we didn't have but

11:13.938 --> 11:15.497
Good, we go to the
second history

11:15.497 --> 11:16.679
Do we go?

11:16.899 --> 11:18.766
No, don't help me in anything

11:18.999 --> 11:20.539
Not he/she knew that you were here

11:20.746 --> 11:23.392
Undoubtedly not wise, not you
nobody cares but that your same one

11:23.597 --> 11:26.231
- Gretchen
- Don't tempt me today, you will lose

11:29.710 --> 11:32.528
Do they come that? Am I crazy?
Not wise that was here

11:32.528 --> 11:35.878
God, goes to the point, there is not
something that could... 

11:37.183 --> 11:39.949
 ... before never we fought
before we laughed at those people

11:40.288 --> 11:42.638
If it broke that knot
I would laugh so much

11:42.886 --> 11:44.613
They knew that laughing
is the best medicine?

11:44.922 --> 11:48.155
No, he/she would not need medicine
to break it

11:48.155 --> 11:49.667
It is this way like he/she was laughing

11:49.889 --> 11:57.333
It was so much time ago I laughed
so much that he/she already forgets like it is

11:58.193 --> 12:00.475
I sit down it, I didn't want to bore them
with this... 

12:00.475 --> 12:02.310
 ... oxydon 3

12:02.551 --> 12:05.249
It is this way like he/she called himself that oil

12:06.331 --> 12:07.920
Good, let us return to
our 10 histories

12:08.198 --> 12:09.571
We Go with the No. 2

12:09.844 --> 12:12.398
The duck, the news

12:16.910 --> 12:19.541
NOT YOU SWORE IN THE NAME OF GOD
IN VAIN

13:04.205 --> 13:05.731
Improving your Spanish?

13:05.971 --> 13:07.564
If, a moment

13:09.680 --> 13:10.511
Very well

13:10.721 --> 13:12.040
You hear yourself as my grandma

13:14.241 --> 13:15.094
That not so good fué

13:18.493 --> 13:19.951
As it is, I want that
know Tony

13:20.164 --> 13:23.059
It will be in Mexico this summer

13:23.059 --> 13:24.200
Very well Oliver

13:24.200 --> 13:27.894
I will be able to improve my pronunciation

13:28.125 --> 13:29.375
Mexico

13:29.375 --> 13:31.353
Do you see what we have Gloria?

13:31.562 --> 13:33.671
For that don't leave with me?

13:33.903 --> 13:35.961
God willing it felt this way, but not

13:37.396 --> 13:38.785
Not you can be my girlfriend

13:39.264 --> 13:41.010
Every day, during
five years

13:41.231 --> 13:44.096
I introduce you to Tony,
your temporary substitution

13:45.039 --> 13:46.446
As these?

13:47.196 --> 13:49.027
He/she had not seen you

13:50.358 --> 13:52.622
- Hello, pardon, this better one?
- A lot

13:53.946 --> 13:55.842
The system this here

13:56.059 --> 13:59.504

and if you need something

13:59.711 --> 14:01.464
- you can call me... 
- Hey relaxes you

14:01.704 --> 14:03.081
He/she takes your vacations

14:03.284 --> 14:04.752
Drive crazy you, have a good time

14:04.752 --> 14:07.044
Tony can get ready them
certain Tony?

14:13.358 --> 14:15.193
Perhaps be right

15:07.294 --> 15:09.140
- I want... 
- If

15:10.059 --> 15:11.795
I want... 

15:12.602 --> 15:13.951
 ... to catch your teats, if!

15:14.673 --> 15:17.227
No, I don't believe that it is
that what you try to say

15:18.446 --> 15:20.250
A moment

15:43.110 --> 15:45.056
Prove this...  it is very sweet

16:39.898 --> 16:41.347
"Thank you" Alfonso, but... 

16:44.147 --> 16:46.316
 ... "tired" by my airplane

16:50.711 --> 16:52.082
He is Jesús

17:18.929 --> 17:20.259
I like in knowing you

22:44.877 --> 22:48.588
 ... our gentleman and savior
Jesus Christ

22:52.379 --> 22:53.755
Oh Oliver, if, Oliver

22:55.032 --> 22:55.992
Oh Jesús

22:59.023 --> 23:00.171
Who demons are Jesús

23:00.849 --> 23:02.102
Nobody, Oliver

23:02.361 --> 23:04.526
- These exaggerating
- Exaggerating?

23:04.765 --> 23:08.527
That it would seem you that
Patricia told you to half... 

23:24.326 --> 23:25.166
9 ...  10

23:30.424 --> 23:32.205
Lament this

23:33.556 --> 23:34.680
From when you exercise?

23:34.890 --> 23:36.630
That you speak?
I found it below

23:36.847 --> 23:38.348
I thought of giving him/her a little
of flavor to my pectoral

23:38.558 --> 23:41.850
- Flavor to your pectoral?
- That? Flavor to my pectoral

23:42.071 --> 23:43.218
Not you

23:43.439 --> 23:45.610
There is something that I don't like

23:45.610 --> 23:48.123
That you think Rachel?
That I deceive you?

23:48.123 --> 23:51.136
Allow me to guess, I knew to
a girl in the coffee

23:51.340 --> 23:56.692
It is as if you take something hot
with a glove you didn't burn

23:56.925 --> 23:58.661
- Twice?
- Not he/she will say that

23:58.661 --> 24:02.114
- Then I can... 
- Please, continuous

24:04.786 --> 24:06.035
They saw, boys

24:06.035 --> 24:08.429
It questions my pectoral

24:09.648 --> 24:11.473
I sit down it it was not my intention... 

24:12.133 --> 24:14.294
Ah if, here the third history goes

24:16.997 --> 24:18.197
NOT YOU KILLED

24:30.924 --> 24:31.642
Scalpel

24:35.206 --> 24:35.909
Forceps

24:42.746 --> 24:43.886
This well?

24:45.403 --> 24:47.319
- Scissors
- scissors

24:53.528 --> 24:55.388
- It is everything
- Good work, Dr Richie

24:55.388 --> 24:57.038
Thank You Mattie

25:06.891 --> 25:11.211
- Every time that I move.
- Hey seems that we have a couple... 

25:11.211 --> 25:14.256
Dr. she has a horrible pain
from the operation

25:15.123 --> 25:16.979
Oh if

25:22.821 --> 25:25.605
Do you see this? Not it should be there

25:25.862 --> 25:28.937
This cutting the knives

25:29.701 --> 25:31.145
The scissors prescribe

25:32.368 --> 25:33.766
They are causing most
of the pain

25:33.988 --> 25:36.459
I leave the scissors inside
of my wife?

25:38.707 --> 25:41.130
- If, it is this way
- How could it make this way an error?

25:41.130 --> 25:44.325
Not fué error, I made it as joke

25:44.325 --> 25:46.830
- Does he/she joke?
- No, relax you

25:47.937 --> 25:51.449
- As joke, I made it as joke
- Not I understand

25:52.165 --> 25:54.517
Clearly he/she doesn't know me,
I joke a lot

25:54.517 --> 25:56.992
My friends know it

25:57.197 --> 26:01.767
If, I joke, the thing is
that he/she has to understand my sense of humor

26:01.767 --> 26:03.784
I believe that it is everything, Natty

26:03.986 --> 26:07.799
Your you were when it operates her
throw the scissors in their belly

26:08.010 --> 26:09.251
For that made it?

26:09.475 --> 26:11.178
if I remember well, he/she made it
as joke

26:12.386 --> 26:16.706
- Now you do go?
- Dog son, serve looks at that of the... !

26:16.706 --> 26:18.191
 ... stomach of my wife, now!

26:21.796 --> 26:23.232
Baby

26:23.961 --> 26:25.027
- This dead one
- What?

26:25.773 --> 26:27.323
Do wait, is a joke?

26:27.561 --> 26:29.245
It is a...  no, this dead one

26:29.475 --> 26:31.929
He/she still wants him to remove him/her
the scissors, seemingly not

26:31.929 --> 26:36.019
- He/she murdered my wife
- Hey, fué a joke

26:36.276 --> 26:38.590
As joke, does he/she know that?

26:38.807 --> 26:40.918
It is very violent, I have
that to fly

26:47.248 --> 26:48.357
Let us be direct

26:49.519 --> 26:54.903
He/she says that you accent a
I orchestrate surgical in their body... 

26:55.110 --> 26:56.963
 ... knowing it and deliberately

26:57.260 --> 27:01.089
I have been a good surgeon
during 20 years

27:01.089 --> 27:04.664
Good citizen, a father,
family man...  a husband

27:08.655 --> 27:12.565
It put those deliberately
scissors in their body?

27:12.817 --> 27:17.803
He/she would never make something that hurt to
some patient, fué a joke

27:18.025 --> 27:20.407
- Did it put the scissors?
- They belonged to practitioners

27:20.407 --> 27:23.503
- Did it put the scissors?
- During the last 20 years

27:23.503 --> 27:25.305
Did it put the scissors?

27:25.305 --> 27:28.334
- Did it put the scissors?
- As a prostitute joke

27:36.974 --> 27:38.442
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury

27:39.186 --> 27:40.857
I would like a joke

27:40.857 --> 27:43.475
As much as to this type

27:44.083 --> 27:47.556
In the school, me and my
roommate

27:48.264 --> 27:52.335
We put to an oriental inside
of the cajuela of my corvette

27:53.475 --> 27:54.578
It is a joke

27:56.654 --> 27:58.267
But it is a joke... 

27:59.740 --> 28:01.961
 ... and later fué murder

28:02.204 --> 28:04.192
- Objection
- Accepted

28:04.192 --> 28:05.435
Refused

28:07.608 --> 28:08.634
Alone I joke

28:09.476 --> 28:12.251
It is one of the many examples

28:13.344 --> 28:16.747
I already heard too much, I am here
to close up of for life

28:16.963 --> 28:18.867
For the murder of Sheyla Contiella

28:22.022 --> 28:23.048
Their lordship

28:23.638 --> 28:25.900
- Will we have the same thing?
- Clear

28:26.124 --> 28:27.712
does he/she want to go by everything?

28:28.497 --> 28:29.672
As he/she wants

28:42.336 --> 28:44.294
- They arrived to a verdict
- It is this way, their lordship

28:44.986 --> 28:46.558
Us the jury, we find
to the protected one... 

28:47.550 --> 28:48.609
 ... guilty

28:48.881 --> 28:50.238
Murder in first grade

28:51.622 --> 28:55.781
Not to say this, but
what I said 3 hours ago was not?

28:55.998 --> 28:59.945
- But they insisted in... 
- But their lordship, the system works this way

29:00.165 --> 29:02.768
Is it as well as does the system work?

29:03.547 --> 29:09.084
Please, say but to the world
we want to know it

29:09.084 --> 29:12.009
The Verdict is, as there was him
said before

29:12.277 --> 29:14.977
Life imprisonment, for
Dr. Richie

29:16.075 --> 29:17.292
Is a joke?

29:17.565 --> 29:18.565
I don't believe it

29:18.865 --> 29:22.287
If it was for my, it would send it to the death

29:23.074 --> 29:24.720
Damned imbiles

29:27.890 --> 29:30.506
- Thank you their lordship
- Ah, your... 

29:30.735 --> 29:33.028
- Your in contempt
- Me?

29:33.326 --> 29:34.596
For that? That I will make?

29:34.823 --> 29:37.670
I knew that there are vacancies in
the plant

29:38.720 --> 29:41.162
He/she can that it is better than this

29:41.478 --> 29:43.066
You were very good in this

29:43.355 --> 29:44.601

30:12.209 --> 30:14.989
From now on, you will be Is it handcuffs
of Bost

30:16.783 --> 30:21.784
No, I already have wife, you will should
to take somebody but

30:31.735 --> 30:34.669
But it is worth you that you are quiet the muzzle
and begin to suck me the verga

30:37.156 --> 30:38.510
I joke

30:46.427 --> 30:47.387
Very good

30:48.150 --> 30:49.042

30:49.042 --> 30:50.575
Make it

30:54.592 --> 30:56.394

the whole day

30:57.184 --> 31:00.462
Oh if, this playing basketbol

31:00.670 --> 31:02.867
It will be outside hours

31:03.892 --> 31:05.586
- Oh not you... 
- Which the alternative is?

31:05.834 --> 31:08.768
It ruined your glorious day

31:09.016 --> 31:12.575
I want to make you love
before your session

31:12.797 --> 31:14.379
It is terrible about the love
of the women

31:14.674 --> 31:16.281
I believe that we would should
to see the points

31:16.545 --> 31:18.885
Don't misinterpret me, I offer you
a same salary

31:19.123 --> 31:21.741
But there are some differences

31:21.741 --> 31:23.791
You want to be in the front line
I don't believe it

31:24.057 --> 31:27.151
The Russian will come and
they will want to be in your boobies

31:28.248 --> 31:30.777
You are so sexy when
politics languages

31:33.715 --> 31:35.606

- Soon

31:35.876 --> 31:38.013
- soon
- alone you make me promises

31:38.013 --> 31:40.966
Him you, is complicated you will have
that to have patience

31:44.138 --> 31:45.814
I will make it this week

31:47.171 --> 31:48.102
This is the following history

31:50.633 --> 31:52.649
It becomes touching

31:53.635 --> 31:54.864
Can you feel?

31:59.063 --> 32:01.825
You HONORED Your Father and Mother

32:04.678 --> 32:06.650
20 years ago

32:16.226 --> 32:18.889
- Is he/she a boy or girl?
- I will say this way it, the first are boy... 

32:19.142 --> 32:21.084
 ... here the boy Not comes. 2

32:21.338 --> 32:23.135
Oh my God

32:27.409 --> 32:28.803
Is there ace in that vagina?

32:30.112 --> 32:31.044
I love it

32:33.917 --> 32:35.418
My small ones

32:38.195 --> 32:41.016
I will love them until I die

32:57.394 --> 32:58.797
We have already grown

32:59.841 --> 33:01.328
I believe that it is moment
of telling us the truth

33:02.719 --> 33:03.606
About that?

33:03.824 --> 33:05.914
about the fact that
your and dad are white

33:05.914 --> 33:07.517
and we are black

33:09.762 --> 33:10.506
certain

33:11.254 --> 33:12.758
Wise that this day he/she would come

33:14.015 --> 33:15.621
The year before they were born

33:16.483 --> 33:19.085
He/she was the reporter for
the local newspaper

33:19.974 --> 33:23.632
And I had to opportunity of interviewing
to all the big stars

33:23.632 --> 33:25.641
Denzel Washington

33:26.387 --> 33:27.772
Morgan Freeman

33:28.273 --> 33:30.118
 ... to all

33:30.838 --> 33:33.569
And although it was married with
their father

33:34.048 --> 33:36.319
And it was very in love of the one

33:36.828 --> 33:38.239
From time to time

33:38.540 --> 33:40.167
After the interviews

33:40.453 --> 33:42.683
These stars

33:43.703 --> 33:44.783
They caught me

33:46.928 --> 33:49.684
Mom, leave you of things
did you have sex with them or not?

33:49.684 --> 33:52.520
- As I said... 
- Who is our biological father?

33:53.438 --> 33:56.505
One night after one
he/she interviews... 

33:56.505 --> 33:59.398
 ... take the opportunity of... 

33:59.767 --> 34:01.564
 ... to catch with Arnold Zuartzeneger

34:02.633 --> 34:03.442
and... 

34:03.720 --> 34:05.126
They need that I spelled them to him

34:05.411 --> 34:05.911
if

34:08.465 --> 34:09.545
I...  F... 

34:13.251 --> 34:15.400
Or...  Z...  K... 

34:16.495 --> 34:17.745
 ... Or...  D... 

34:18.495 --> 34:20.139
To...  R...  N... 

34:20.398 --> 34:21.760
Or...  L...  D

34:23.085 --> 34:24.848
S...  Z... 

34:25.879 --> 34:28.436
-  ...  And... 
- Mom - you Allow it to finish

34:30.204 --> 34:34.138
 ... W...  To...  R...  And...  N

34:34.428 --> 34:37.120
And...  G...  G... 

34:38.335 --> 34:39.675
 ... And...  R

34:41.197 --> 34:44.031
You Say that Arnold Zwarszenegger
is our biological father?

34:44.266 --> 34:47.053
If, for that reason they are so high

34:47.869 --> 34:50.429
He/she always told to all
that they were high because they ate a lot

34:51.228 --> 34:53.243
- As you can be sure... ?
- Positive

34:53.487 --> 34:55.438
It was with the only one with the one
that I was in that moment

34:55.708 --> 34:57.799
And I made myself a test of blood
to prove it

34:58.048 --> 34:59.646
How you explain the color
dark of the skin?

34:59.867 --> 35:03.181
Him you, believe me, him you

35:09.593 --> 35:13.403
About that conversation
I have been thinking a lot

35:13.688 --> 35:15.782
and I have decided

35:16.062 --> 35:18.390
it is better for you
that they know their true father

35:19.213 --> 35:20.010
Really?

35:20.233 --> 35:22.692
If...  so... 

35:23.057 --> 35:24.810
Without but that to say

35:25.799 --> 35:28.574
He/she has returned, and here it is

35:29.466 --> 35:31.952
The man, schemes it

35:32.254 --> 35:33.781
Their father

35:34.079 --> 35:37.992
The incomparable one, Arnold Zswarzenegger

35:40.909 --> 35:42.069
Hello children

35:42.341 --> 35:43.448
I Am Arnold

35:43.716 --> 35:45.875
Finally I know my
two children

35:46.817 --> 35:48.364
It will be fantastic

35:48.576 --> 35:51.727
Do they want to go to the bar or something like that?

35:52.698 --> 35:53.645
he/she suckles

35:54.535 --> 35:55.851
He is not Arnold zwarzenegger

35:57.644 --> 36:01.018
- Could you wait in the room?
- Clear

36:02.145 --> 36:02.941
egresare

36:05.328 --> 36:09.113
Look, I tried to arrive to Arnold
but now he/she is a politician

36:09.322 --> 36:11.317
and I could not pass the reception

36:11.577 --> 36:13.359
that type is it covers its events

36:13.620 --> 36:17.130
Alone he/she wanted to give them an idea
of like it was

36:17.857 --> 36:18.934
this well suckles

36:18.934 --> 36:20.345
thank you

36:20.608 --> 36:22.145
We will try him to work

36:22.879 --> 36:24.427
Those are my beautiful boys

36:25.872 --> 36:26.677
Return

36:30.647 --> 36:31.496
Dad

36:32.698 --> 36:33.427
son

36:53.302 --> 36:55.920
You that this owes
to be difficult for you

36:56.680 --> 36:57.750
so many levels

36:58.994 --> 37:01.698
1. their father has died

37:02.252 --> 37:06.586
He/she makes but of one week
it would not have imagined this

37:06.879 --> 37:09.430
after canceling
a great battle

37:10.471 --> 37:18.029
2. that their biological father is not nobody
but that the international star and governor

37:18.268 --> 37:19.578
they already know who is

37:19.800 --> 37:21.176
Arnold Zwarzenegger

37:22.397 --> 37:24.047
To have me to my, replacing it to the one

37:31.299 --> 37:32.852
and to make them feel comfortable

37:33.101 --> 37:33.941
comfortable

37:36.939 --> 37:37.972
and complete

37:39.085 --> 37:46.796
To know that they have two biological parents
and to be African-American American

37:49.347 --> 37:50.309
it should be difficult

37:50.654 --> 37:51.867
not so much

37:52.868 --> 37:55.746
you don't have to fake the voice
of Arnold if you don't want

37:59.913 --> 38:01.871
look, to be honest with you

38:03.463 --> 38:06.150
it is sometimes but fcil to express
my true feelings

38:06.370 --> 38:08.088
making this personification

38:09.200 --> 38:14.467
there are things that he/she can say
but that Mark Jakempson

38:16.713 --> 38:18.082
many

38:20.228 --> 38:21.702
We go

38:41.183 --> 38:42.749
Look at my so sweated children

38:43.029 --> 38:46.154
he/she suckles, true Arnold szwaurzenegger
it is as this

38:46.384 --> 38:48.253
I have not spoken with the one
in years

38:49.126 --> 38:50.483
according to memory

38:51.639 --> 38:52.994
Oh my God

38:53.358 --> 38:54.649
Van to hate me for this reason

38:55.349 --> 38:57.230
I made some... 

39:00.386 --> 39:02.592
Not it was Arnold Szwarzenegger

39:04.139 --> 39:04.859
It was... 

39:07.856 --> 39:09.329
That explains a lot

39:09.577 --> 39:11.234
Then discover the true truth

39:11.234 --> 39:13.150
And the test of blood that you said?

39:13.375 --> 39:15.278
It was for the... 

39:17.695 --> 39:19.010
And like I am?

39:19.771 --> 39:21.255
What can we make?

39:22.671 --> 39:23.171
No

39:25.384 --> 39:28.554
I can make a good Eddie Murphy

39:28.774 --> 39:30.447
- This well
- Same difference

39:42.708 --> 39:43.560
Do they remember?

39:47.167 --> 39:48.824
They can think that our
family is a little different

39:48.824 --> 39:50.354
But do they know that?

39:50.354 --> 39:53.156
It is our familla
and it is what counts

39:53.388 --> 39:55.910
Who goes to say who
he/she is your father

39:56.119 --> 39:57.659
Is he/she the person that and did it raise?

39:57.880 --> 39:59.607
Or he/she is the person that gave you their DNA

39:59.870 --> 40:03.574
Or perhaps it is a type that
this in your house imitating comedians

40:03.908 --> 40:07.382
That it is the same one that
your biological father

40:08.330 --> 40:10.247
If they ask us?
It is the I finish

40:10.787 --> 40:14.063
The type that this at home
imitating a famous comedian

40:14.297 --> 40:16.136
that it also raised
to famous other comedian

40:16.655 --> 40:18.074
who is your biological father

40:18.074 --> 40:20.436
- I Am Gratt Jeffey
- and me Ted Jeffey

40:20.436 --> 40:22.971
And we are the Siblings Jeffey

40:34.318 --> 40:38.292
Gretchen is an incredible wife but

40:38.516 --> 40:41.613
Liz makes me feel young and I live

40:42.249 --> 40:45.891
and the sex, hey the sex

40:46.100 --> 40:50.894
If, but it is worthwhile to throw 20 years
of marriage for a moment?

40:51.143 --> 40:56.869
- The monogamy is... 
- what maintains the society in foot

40:57.318 --> 41:01.039
 ... biochemistry...  to deploy
our... 

41:01.278 --> 41:02.876
.. as soon as you burn the truth
you will be but happy

41:03.118 --> 41:04.840
I am happy with this

41:04.840 --> 41:07.406
- Not him these
- I am really it

41:07.622 --> 41:11.357
They were 24 good hours but
it is with who I sleep

41:11.570 --> 41:14.249
If he/she had my milk free
you could be so sure

41:14.510 --> 41:15.859
He/she would begin to catch cows

41:16.128 --> 41:20.285
It is easy to say it for you
I have children

41:20.285 --> 41:23.079
It is the only reason to continue this way
when I wake up

41:23.358 --> 41:25.549
You live in a world of fantasy

41:25.549 --> 41:26.996
Perhaps but I take
a pill

41:26.996 --> 41:28.167
to feel well

41:28.459 --> 41:29.865
Not you to the one who to believe

41:30.135 --> 41:31.735
Ave or Scottie

41:34.740 --> 41:35.859
What is been... 

41:36.153 --> 41:39.350
 ... we have 10 histories
and I won't disappoint you

41:40.228 --> 41:41.130
I promise them to him

41:43.828 --> 41:46.949
NOT YOU COVETED

42:24.775 --> 42:27.876
Does one scheme as of hospital?
for that would make that?

42:28.107 --> 42:29.257
it is ridiculous

42:29.504 --> 42:31.085
The problem of being a hero

42:39.792 --> 42:40.649
do you know that?

42:42.933 --> 42:44.442
we will have one it schemes this way

42:45.334 --> 42:48.136
Affection would not know that
to make on one schemes this way

42:48.351 --> 42:51.550
I will investigate it, if I can with
the Video casetera can with this

42:51.798 --> 42:53.265
I configure VCR

42:53.543 --> 42:55.030

43:13.018 --> 43:13.619

Oh sits down it

43:28.730 --> 43:29.868

43:36.836 --> 43:37.817
I have to have another

43:39.792 --> 43:41.133

43:48.043 --> 43:49.385

Pardon affection had not seen you

44:08.643 --> 44:09.241

46:06.079 --> 46:07.539
that you can have with 5 dollars?

46:07.817 --> 46:09.418
McDonalds

46:10.654 --> 46:11.779
Burger King

46:15.205 --> 46:17.586
I love them, some changes
and they are but famous

46:19.013 --> 46:19.754
It is this way

46:21.055 --> 46:22.639
I really love Ray

46:25.531 --> 46:26.310
thank you

46:30.138 --> 46:35.027
This is the radioactive nucleus
of where the energy comes

46:35.271 --> 46:37.848
so that you connect
their you scheme electric

46:38.064 --> 46:39.654
Doesn't it become very hot there?

46:39.863 --> 46:42.760
Don't worry, we are
perfectly safe here

46:43.100 --> 46:44.180
We know that we make

46:45.388 --> 46:46.904
Attention, this it is not a mockery

46:47.173 --> 46:49.632
This is not a mockery,
all the levels... 

46:51.587 --> 46:53.861
This happening!

46:55.930 --> 47:01.187
There are many children that can be
exposed at dangerous levels of radiation!

47:01.480 --> 47:02.154
That demons will make?

47:02.358 --> 47:06.088
The substitution will be able to fix everything
in the following hour

47:06.309 --> 47:10.848
Impossible, where we go to
does to find scheme this way in this city?

47:11.321 --> 47:13.869
- I have an idea
- That it happens we already have many problems

47:14.132 --> 47:18.776
In a reality show... 

47:18.997 --> 47:22.255
- That that is?
- It is a panel of celebrities

47:22.473 --> 47:23.787
Not you!

47:25.987 --> 47:31.028
- I was hardly happened
- we will speak later when we concentrate

47:31.028 --> 47:36.574
Your dad doesn't maybe have a
heap of you scheme this way?

47:56.572 --> 47:57.756
Not there is here neither nobody

47:58.061 --> 47:59.185
I don't have my key

48:45.188 --> 48:47.974
It is an entire relief the one
to leave the house

48:49.233 --> 48:50.431
Your you said it

49:28.634 --> 49:29.529

49:46.943 --> 49:50.342
In the news, 75 children
they are dying

49:50.544 --> 49:53.698
as a result of an accident
in a nuclear plant

49:53.991 --> 49:58.349
The hopes finished the one
not to be able to enter to those houses

49:58.563 --> 50:02.040
It is reported that they had dozens
of you scheme that they would save their lives

50:02.305 --> 50:07.313
Collected without reason by two neighbors
that unaccountably they have not been opposing

50:07.528 --> 50:12.622
Formally this being pursued
the one in charge of the nuclear plant

50:12.910 --> 50:15.387
The details to the moment

50:20.122 --> 50:21.294
the bill

50:23.070 --> 50:24.606
Have you been deceiving me one year ago?

50:24.821 --> 50:27.655
He/she finished, long!

50:27.878 --> 50:31.202
I am fed up with your lies
of your excuses and your... 

50:31.620 --> 50:33.375
 ... lousy stone chart

50:33.375 --> 50:34.678
To where it is supposed that he/she goes?

50:35.854 --> 50:37.286
For my it vetoes to the hell

50:37.286 --> 50:39.205
Veto with your small prostitute

50:39.205 --> 50:40.417
Not he/she is a prostitute

50:40.654 --> 50:42.454
he/she is an actress and you know it

50:42.694 --> 50:45.880
one is also considered
magician

50:46.102 --> 50:47.803
You know that that your you cannot make... 

50:47.803 --> 50:49.793
Not say anything of that that
you can be sorry

50:50.025 --> 50:53.921
- Don't say it, I notice it to you!
- Veto to fly, Gretchen

50:56.515 --> 50:57.739
Veto to fly

51:00.364 --> 51:02.831
Prostitute's son!

51:11.450 --> 51:13.312
 Ok, something that to speak... 

51:13.579 --> 51:16.687
NOT you WANTED THE Woman
DE YOUR NEIGHBOR

51:44.031 --> 51:46.596
They have not shown up
they have just transferred me

51:46.873 --> 51:48.820
Oh a pleasure, Glen Richie

51:51.241 --> 51:53.530
You are the one that killed
to one of their patients

51:54.659 --> 51:55.476
it was a joke

51:56.499 --> 51:57.658
If it was joke, I understand it

51:58.889 --> 52:01.100
Finally somebody understands it

52:07.141 --> 52:10.838
He/she makes a lot that I am not out

52:11.677 --> 52:13.904
Something new that to say?

52:17.262 --> 52:18.405
- It is good
- Do you joke?

52:18.641 --> 52:21.685
this type has a
social problem

52:21.901 --> 52:23.864
I tell it to you, they have a social calendar

52:24.068 --> 52:25.297
better than none

52:28.666 --> 52:29.904
if for some reason salts

52:30.181 --> 52:31.410
there won't be reason

52:32.594 --> 52:34.159
But it is not so bad here

52:39.641 --> 52:41.758
I am addicted to that

52:49.621 --> 52:50.461
Pardon

52:52.576 --> 52:56.169
It would bother you if I sit down next to you

52:57.037 --> 52:58.865
No, it sounds very well but... 

52:59.902 --> 53:01.062
 ... I don't believe that it is good idea

53:02.067 --> 53:05.141
I have a great partner
and it would violate me for that reason

53:11.161 --> 53:12.200
It is my luck

53:13.139 --> 53:14.345
I should know that they would take you

53:20.398 --> 53:22.464
That but I can say

53:23.779 --> 53:28.553
Do you know that? to the devil, we are alone
two people enjoying their company

53:32.736 --> 53:35.270
To who he cares, I say
first the security

53:38.450 --> 53:40.312
The heat

53:52.738 --> 53:54.151
The life is interesting

53:58.557 --> 54:01.768
He/she looks, you that you already have owner

54:01.997 --> 54:04.503
And I respect that totally

54:06.383 --> 54:08.726
But your and I are
so similar

54:09.484 --> 54:13.313
When I pass that of this type, I said
the life is interesting and your also said it

54:15.759 --> 54:17.624
It is the type of moments
of those that I speak

54:19.496 --> 54:23.309
I sometimes wonder as serious if
it was me the one that violated you every night

54:26.897 --> 54:27.870
you know

54:28.117 --> 54:31.317
I believe that I sit down the energy
of our friendship

54:31.550 --> 54:35.363
- and you project it in something that is not
- No, me not... 

54:39.565 --> 54:40.765
 ... I don't project it

54:41.852 --> 54:47.181
I can see you without you chewed
as if we were in another side

54:48.641 --> 54:49.912
you would hit me in the mouth

54:51.969 --> 54:53.367
and it would violate you

54:54.815 --> 54:56.175
Without your consent, clear

54:57.694 --> 54:59.628
That is very valiant

55:01.937 --> 55:03.088
Of that it is violating

55:09.057 --> 55:10.741
- He/she looks and I have listened
- But

55:10.741 --> 55:14.313
I cannot simply change

55:16.111 --> 55:16.977
it is not so simple

55:22.969 --> 55:25.307
- I will already fix it
- Not be of the type... 

55:25.307 --> 55:27.010
Not I can

55:28.709 --> 55:32.417
I don't have left it a lot,
see you later

55:46.267 --> 55:47.535
To where chingados
do you believe that you go?

56:13.241 --> 56:14.405
Buster, we have to speak

56:15.778 --> 56:18.076
Oh not, don't tell me

56:23.287 --> 56:24.007
Dwayne

56:26.874 --> 56:32.285
Not it is easy, Dwayne asked me him to be its dog,
and I am not sure of wanting or... 

56:32.545 --> 56:34.628
 ... noq to want to be their dog

56:36.238 --> 56:37.502
Tell me that it is joke

56:38.441 --> 56:39.553
No, this time not

56:42.269 --> 56:45.534
We have gone by moments
emotional, we know it

56:45.831 --> 56:49.065
this cell explains to it but that anything

56:52.214 --> 56:53.717
wise that this day it would arrive

56:57.278 --> 57:00.775
Listen to me...  you have to make
what you have to make

57:02.297 --> 57:03.937
Whenever your ass
be violated

57:04.159 --> 57:05.601
I suppose that it will be this way

57:05.901 --> 57:07.645
for somebody who is

57:08.296 --> 57:09.547
every night

57:12.173 --> 57:13.532
and it is what it cares

57:23.960 --> 57:25.972
he/she joked

57:28.138 --> 57:28.985
ahead

57:29.238 --> 57:30.699

57:56.420 --> 57:57.294
that it happens?

57:58.114 --> 58:00.152

58:01.546 --> 58:03.184
 ... it seems that I take it well

58:07.455 --> 58:08.471
this is wonderful

58:11.812 --> 58:12.930
Do you know what means, not?

58:34.895 --> 58:38.160
The king is the but big

58:39.425 --> 58:42.612
All that I have made

58:42.836 --> 58:44.839
It has been expressed intensely

58:46.739 --> 58:48.528
The life is to delight

58:48.865 --> 58:51.071
day by day

58:51.296 --> 58:53.321
The hours will be patient

58:53.533 --> 58:56.984

58:57.232 --> 58:59.096
 ... leave it in our hands

58:59.883 --> 59:02.707

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:42.774
Not it is amusing

01:01:43.053 --> 01:01:45.201
He/she allows to hear what Gary says

01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:48.165
- Idiot
- When he/she says you can unite

01:01:50.092 --> 01:01:51.965
He/she is a great comedian

01:01:54.719 --> 01:01:55.863
Oh my God

01:01:57.501 --> 01:02:00.593
I believe that it was part of the act

01:02:00.896 --> 01:02:03.277
can you be quiet one second?

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:06.681
Affection is our moon
of honey, we should take champagne

01:02:06.941 --> 01:02:11.569
- To return to the room
- Please, I have just had dinner

01:02:14.183 --> 01:02:15.282

01:02:15.546 --> 01:02:17.243
- We love the show
- Thank you

01:02:18.048 --> 01:02:19.196
Can I speak with Gary?

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.045
Clear

01:02:28.724 --> 01:02:31.505
Hey baby, is glad me

01:02:32.283 --> 01:02:34.672
For that don't come undone of the one
and we will be able to speak

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:38.645
You showed me your hard verga
as you said?

01:02:42.036 --> 01:02:43.785
I already have to leave

01:02:44.003 --> 01:02:46.482
Well for that doesn't leave
that Gary comes with us

01:02:46.692 --> 01:02:49.870
- Affection believes that... 
- I will hit you in the face

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:54.160
That Gary says,
we go to the field

01:02:54.376 --> 01:02:56.843
This a little tired
good night

01:02:57.964 --> 01:03:00.832
You are maybe... 

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:04.392
Not I am gay because I go out with small

01:03:04.727 --> 01:03:06.585
and Gary is not Gay because
he/she is a marionette

01:03:06.837 --> 01:03:08.360
that I bought in a company
in Chicago

01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:11.236
Good night

01:03:14.184 --> 01:03:15.766
Kelly, we go... 

01:03:27.924 --> 01:03:30.234

01:03:30.566 --> 01:03:32.733
I have go to walk

01:03:32.956 --> 01:03:34.923
Really? Because it would rot... 

01:03:36.476 --> 01:03:37.379
 ... to go with you

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.709

01:04:01.025 --> 01:04:04.434
I have many condoms

01:04:05.578 --> 01:04:08.074
I want to make it

01:05:23.183 --> 01:05:24.888
Does he/she know where was the it finishes time?

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.171
thank you to call to the police

01:06:16.301 --> 01:06:17.625
We should call to the police

01:06:27.244 --> 01:06:28.116
I sit down it

01:06:28.441 --> 01:06:30.233
I thought that him toward
but not

01:06:30.475 --> 01:06:32.888
I had never felt
so happy for a long time

01:06:34.005 --> 01:06:37.465
we always make the same jokes
I no longer find amusing

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:41.643
Your you were there when my engaged one
it was buried

01:06:41.968 --> 01:06:44.074
- And it continues there
- it continues there

01:06:44.366 --> 01:06:47.626
You said that taenias girlfriend, but
when it was the it finishes time that you came out?

01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:53.312
She dies to go out with you

01:06:54.645 --> 01:06:56.111
Do how many point out you need?

01:06:56.393 --> 01:06:57.997

it is a farce

01:07:11.701 --> 01:07:12.500
perhaps be right

01:07:15.145 --> 01:07:16.761

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:28.039
I am for sure to her
he would love to hear that of you

01:07:56.804 --> 01:07:58.664
It is a madness

01:08:57.156 --> 01:08:58.182
That you make here?

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.520
Gretchen...  hello it was
in the neighborhood

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:04.765
I thought that it could happen
to shit

01:09:04.995 --> 01:09:08.139
Not it is a good moment
for that don't return tomorrow?

01:09:08.372 --> 01:09:10.026
Can I enter for single 5 minutes?

01:09:10.026 --> 01:09:11.661
Tomorrow perhaps doesn't have
necessity to shit

01:09:12.953 --> 01:09:13.823
Who this in the door?

01:09:15.874 --> 01:09:18.983

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:27.859

01:09:28.673 --> 01:09:30.211
In fact we look for a ponny

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:32.750
A ponny can be
delicious

01:09:35.106 --> 01:09:38.899
As I said, it is not moment
so that you shit

01:09:40.872 --> 01:09:42.734
But it was good to see you,
you are brilliant

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:45.520
It is always well you

01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:47.362
You are tired

01:09:54.666 --> 01:09:58.387
- Rot then
- Am I taking my Oega Trifásico, ok?

01:09:58.604 --> 01:10:00.128
Alone that not in the same way

01:10:01.802 --> 01:10:02.985
It is for that reason

01:10:04.822 --> 01:10:05.971
If it is for that reason

01:10:06.432 --> 01:10:07.785
That you are lucky, Jeff

01:10:09.053 --> 01:10:10.230
Also your, Gretchen

01:10:26.863 --> 01:10:30.568
NOT YOU LIFTED REINFORCEMENT TESTIMONY

01:11:02.996 --> 01:11:04.087
The new one this awake one

01:11:05.087 --> 01:11:06.964
As not, if it hurts me
the head

01:11:08.585 --> 01:11:10.219
And definitively I will need something but

01:11:10.219 --> 01:11:12.026
you to what you refer

01:11:12.276 --> 01:11:14.497
You Need a Lionel Rynold

01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:19.046
It is always the shit
for that lick this way it?

01:11:21.621 --> 01:11:24.998
It is a good question and
there is a history, friend

01:11:25.252 --> 01:11:28.451
León Renold, in fact existed

01:11:30.927 --> 01:11:35.066
Before that he/she lived in New York

01:11:35.066 --> 01:11:38.957
No, the history begins before

01:11:39.158 --> 01:11:40.781
Did you count your history or mine?

01:11:41.018 --> 01:11:45.946
The first in the history of he/she Quarrels
it is when it left the school

01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:49.033
And I work AD in Washington

01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:52.719
He/she opened locks

01:11:53.485 --> 01:11:55.915
It was difficult because
not taenia fingers

01:11:56.176 --> 01:11:58.275
Their prostitute open door wants
take

01:11:59.561 --> 01:12:01.235
You paid for that reason, he/she Quarrels!

01:12:03.745 --> 01:12:05.390
So for that reason they call
to this Life does Quarrel?

01:12:05.657 --> 01:12:07.655
There is but in the history

01:12:07.899 --> 01:12:11.271
Some years later, he/she Quarrels
he/she worked in the streets

01:12:11.509 --> 01:12:15.840
- Give me one second
- Not I do have toa the night, does it work or that?

01:12:16.062 --> 01:12:17.842
Don't speak to me, leave me
to concentrate

01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:21.414
Do you know that? Forget it

01:12:22.731 --> 01:12:24.207
God that passes them

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:26.165
For that reason he/she was not able to
to maintain a work

01:12:27.727 --> 01:12:29.230
He/she wanted to play the piano

01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:40.717
- These discharged
- That?

01:12:40.997 --> 01:12:42.880
Because I sit down passion
for this reason?

01:12:55.973 --> 01:12:57.596
- If
- Do you know that I knew?

01:12:58.501 --> 01:13:03.656
That it is of the racist organization

01:13:04.528 --> 01:13:06.271
If, it is this way

01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:09.352
Undoubtedly if

01:13:19.713 --> 01:13:21.911
Finally he/she Quarrels he/she found something
in what was good

01:13:22.188 --> 01:13:23.679
To say lies

01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:29.635
You know that she sucks him/her
the eggs to somebody in a party?

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:33.960
Wise that your he/she suckles
was it in and prostitutes' service?

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.994
Take away from the director, he/she wants
to catch to all the children

01:13:40.368 --> 01:13:44.296
- He/she quarrels it was in the summit of the world
- Does he/she quarrel that there is?

01:14:00.174 --> 01:14:03.185
Aaron, you knew that that
did it pass the lizard?

01:14:03.407 --> 01:14:05.386
You knew what passed him/her
to your face?

01:14:13.839 --> 01:14:17.791
Until he/she heard something

01:14:18.222 --> 01:14:20.297
Evil dogs
really

01:14:20.554 --> 01:14:23.351
And all were infected
to if same

01:14:23.599 --> 01:14:26.601
With an illness of
transmission sexual human

01:14:26.891 --> 01:14:28.575
and they planned to begin an orgy

01:14:28.816 --> 01:14:30.166
to infect to the whole town

01:14:31.312 --> 01:14:34.170
This way the one Quarrels he/she wanted to notice
to all

01:14:34.606 --> 01:14:37.345
A moment for that those dogs were infected
with a mortal illness?

01:14:40.169 --> 01:14:41.679
They were immune

01:14:41.679 --> 01:14:45.327
Listen all, don't have
sex with the dogs

01:14:45.532 --> 01:14:49.073
they plan to have an orgy

01:14:50.702 --> 01:14:52.948
You always lie for that
we should believe you

01:14:53.792 --> 01:14:57.159
Hey has gender together all

01:14:58.039 --> 01:15:01.623
- Not you
- To who you will believe him/her to he/she Quarrels or to the winning dog

01:15:35.266 --> 01:15:36.316
It began to lose weight

01:15:41.611 --> 01:15:43.836
For that reason they call to this
Does Liar Quarrel?

01:15:43.836 --> 01:15:46.606
Because it is the same thing
every day

01:15:47.628 --> 01:15:49.108
gentlemen

01:15:51.348 --> 01:15:53.491
- See you later friends
- That the one is he/she Quarrels?

01:15:58.234 --> 01:16:00.456
This is the place
it is not necessary a lot to look

01:16:01.368 --> 01:16:02.663
What you see is what there is

01:16:03.444 --> 01:16:05.006
That you waited for 850 a month

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:09.346
What you see is what there is

01:16:09.568 --> 01:16:11.159
or that you waited for
850 a month

01:16:11.376 --> 01:16:14.548
The station MIR there out

01:16:15.506 --> 01:16:16.300
In the space?

01:16:16.581 --> 01:16:17.865
I take it to me

01:16:18.116 --> 01:16:19.682
Sr. dalton

01:16:19.972 --> 01:16:22.420
- Dalton...  Timothy Dalton
- As the 007

01:16:23.427 --> 01:16:24.413
It is this way

01:16:27.133 --> 01:16:28.092
The keys

01:16:29.394 --> 01:16:32.263
NOT YOU WILL MAKE ADULTERY

01:17:00.863 --> 01:17:01.732
As you have been?

01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:04.125
Your dilo first

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:07.597
As this Liz?

01:17:07.803 --> 01:17:08.836

01:17:09.151 --> 01:17:10.609
she was very young

01:17:10.822 --> 01:17:13.591
- As this Jim
- Not I work

01:17:14.806 --> 01:17:16.066
Their penis is too big

01:17:16.268 --> 01:17:18.368
I say, for a while
it was grandiose

01:17:19.588 --> 01:17:21.178
God, very well

01:17:21.923 --> 01:17:23.287
I sometimes think of that and.

01:17:24.154 --> 01:17:25.467
 ... I have a small orgasm

01:17:28.569 --> 01:17:31.146
No...  oh waits

01:17:32.113 --> 01:17:33.433
Here he/she comes

01:17:35.139 --> 01:17:36.922
But you know, I don't work

01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:40.936
- And where you live?
- I have this new home

01:17:41.767 --> 01:17:43.944
It is an empty place
without stone charts

01:17:44.798 --> 01:17:46.453
That good that changed

01:17:47.671 --> 01:17:51.480
Gretchen could never apologize

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.489
For what I happen

01:17:56.222 --> 01:17:57.433
You came out of you limit them

01:17:57.433 --> 01:17:59.330
I should never tell it to you

01:17:59.559 --> 01:18:01.244
not after him
that I happen with-

01:18:01.553 --> 01:18:05.057
 ... with you and your brother

01:18:06.245 --> 01:18:07.070
thank you

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.184
Perhaps you would want.

01:18:12.735 --> 01:18:13.910
 ... a cup of coffee

01:18:14.112 --> 01:18:19.073
I would love it, but after finishing
with Liz, let us marry and I won't make the same error

01:18:19.289 --> 01:18:21.019
you already know, adultery

01:18:24.343 --> 01:18:26.221
With who you married?

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:27.474

01:18:27.691 --> 01:18:31.175
- The star of Broadway

01:18:31.421 --> 01:18:33.086
and also of the oscar

01:18:33.301 --> 01:18:35.645
I see that it has been useful

01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:37.647
it is as "thank you"

01:18:40.551 --> 01:18:42.047

01:20:32.952 --> 01:20:34.214
we will arrive late at the church

01:20:35.079 --> 01:20:36.301
the children are already in the car

01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:43.396
I am sick, I believe that
they have poisoned me

01:20:44.182 --> 01:20:45.424
You should go without my

01:21:31.532 --> 01:21:32.414
Totally naked?

01:21:32.623 --> 01:21:34.216
completely naked

01:21:34.216 --> 01:21:35.577
The whole time that
they left to the church

01:21:35.577 --> 01:21:36.850
The whole morning

01:21:37.836 --> 01:21:39.138
He/she is intriguing Oliver

01:21:40.869 --> 01:21:41.987
And I eat it was you on Sunday

01:21:42.205 --> 01:21:44.218
- we could be together
- That I will tell to Gina

01:21:44.218 --> 01:21:45.313
It invents an excuse

01:21:47.095 --> 01:21:48.344
- That?
- Buimia

01:21:50.642 --> 01:21:52.052
- It is something gay'
- No

01:21:54.214 --> 01:21:55.260
I am very heterosexual

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:57.621
I like girls

01:21:57.828 --> 01:22:02.231
But even so I like life

01:22:02.231 --> 01:22:04.076
We are alone a couple
of types heteros

01:22:04.306 --> 01:22:05.697
That they don't go to the church
to be naked

01:22:05.994 --> 01:22:08.137
not you, doesn't like me

01:22:10.854 --> 01:22:12.942
In fact serious

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:18.428
Hey that made you
to change opinion?

01:22:18.665 --> 01:22:21.656
Really these nude

01:22:22.446 --> 01:22:24.274
that it is your penis

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.946
And your bottom there

01:22:28.164 --> 01:22:29.359
You are right

01:22:30.221 --> 01:22:31.657
For that not and ntras and do you take off your clothes?

01:22:32.356 --> 01:22:33.107
well

01:22:43.301 --> 01:22:44.846
I have q ue to tell it to you

01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:47.256
I thought that this serious good

01:22:47.468 --> 01:22:49.426
But this, is very good

01:22:50.287 --> 01:22:51.371
Is it very good, not?

01:22:52.849 --> 01:22:54.255
I have many Cd's

01:22:54.514 --> 01:22:55.608
do you want to hear something?

01:22:57.733 --> 01:22:59.785
Do you joke? It is my favorite one

01:23:00.502 --> 01:23:01.671
That we listen?

01:23:01.919 --> 01:23:03.216
Killing me Softly?

01:23:03.453 --> 01:23:05.406
That is too much

01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:07.232
We go a little but deep

01:23:09.721 --> 01:23:11.457
That such an east

01:23:35.626 --> 01:23:36.879
The contemporary flavor

01:23:37.651 --> 01:23:39.489
The grace of the universe

01:23:41.368 --> 01:23:42.786
That was grandiose

01:23:43.090 --> 01:23:45.687
- That well we pass it
- For that don't come next Sunday'

01:23:46.834 --> 01:23:50.084
Not you, would feel a little guilty
if I don't go to the church

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:53.972
Marty, God not necessarily
he/she wants us to go to the church every Sunday

01:23:54.885 --> 01:23:58.354
Take it as being given or
rest of the normal life

01:23:58.578 --> 01:24:00.098
and to celebrate their great creation

01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:03.341
And that bigger creation

01:24:04.607 --> 01:24:09.324
For my there is not he/she swims well
that to be here, and to move the balls

01:24:12.105 --> 01:24:13.228
It is a great point

01:24:13.487 --> 01:24:15.016
But I have a question

01:24:15.994 --> 01:24:17.212
To how many boys but
should he/she invite?

01:24:17.415 --> 01:24:19.587
On following Sunday

01:24:29.347 --> 01:24:30.461
Who invite it to the one?

01:24:32.585 --> 01:24:35.381
It is the I finish that I need

01:24:37.842 --> 01:24:39.511
Week 5

01:24:40.015 --> 01:24:41.521
I like the music

01:24:43.688 --> 01:24:45.990
I always know them

01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:49.374
Wise that serious good

01:24:49.374 --> 01:24:50.955
Week 7

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.392
And it was no longer angry
and it was completely outside of if

01:24:55.596 --> 01:24:57.787
As their own wall

01:24:59.433 --> 01:25:00.399
Week 9

01:25:16.848 --> 01:25:19.449
We finish early in the church
and your wife goes in road

01:25:36.542 --> 01:25:37.563
This here!

01:25:38.295 --> 01:25:38.928
That we make?

01:25:44.259 --> 01:25:45.740
Hello potato? as your gangrene he/she goes

01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:47.712
Better

01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:50.472
Oliver, does something happen?

01:25:52.095 --> 01:25:52.946
For that?

01:25:53.202 --> 01:25:55.912
You act strange and I want
to know that it happens

01:25:57.418 --> 01:26:02.003
Affection, you deserve to know the truth

01:26:03.589 --> 01:26:05.462
Friends

01:26:08.684 --> 01:26:11.794
Every Sunday, dozens of
men come here

01:26:12.034 --> 01:26:13.100
And they get undressed

01:26:13.872 --> 01:26:15.971
- I already see
- Not we go to the church again

01:26:16.612 --> 01:26:17.512
That you think of that?

01:26:17.724 --> 01:26:19.276
I will tell you what I think

01:26:20.698 --> 01:26:24.592
If you have one again
party of nudes in my house... 

01:26:24.592 --> 01:26:26.066
 ... in a Domingo

01:26:26.861 --> 01:26:29.415
You can kiss me the bottom
when saying goodbye

01:26:30.636 --> 01:26:31.746
a moment Gloria

01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:33.388
Listen to me

01:26:34.049 --> 01:26:35.749
I have been a good man

01:26:35.749 --> 01:26:37.730
all my life

01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:39.844
I have taken care of my children

01:26:40.921 --> 01:26:42.650
and to my wife

01:26:44.082 --> 01:26:45.516
I give to the church

01:26:48.265 --> 01:26:50.360
I never knew about flying

01:26:50.591 --> 01:26:52.701
I have never caught to a prostitute

01:26:53.379 --> 01:26:55.269
So leave us this day

01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:57.513
that every Sunday

01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.847
we have to make this

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:01.269
That is the worst way

01:27:03.529 --> 01:27:05.301
But I felt never so well

01:27:06.029 --> 01:27:07.540
there was really something

01:27:15.347 --> 01:27:18.432
Not this wrong to be naked
in one Sunday

01:27:19.605 --> 01:27:23.271
Comely that would want to make it

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:01.354
Present them this history

01:28:01.562 --> 01:28:03.314
Not they could get lost it

01:28:03.517 --> 01:28:07.997
I read that of the charts but
don't listen the wisdom

01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:11.891
I should never betray my wife
but I made my work

01:28:12.606 --> 01:28:14.361
I gave them 10 short histories

01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:18.169
And we don't die for that reason

01:28:19.305 --> 01:28:25.562
