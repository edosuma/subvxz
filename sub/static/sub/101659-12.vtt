****

00:13.914 --> 00:18.419
****

00:18.552 --> 00:21.655
I couldn't sleep.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.125
We should start taking
your blood pressure every day.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.463
This is very sweet
and responsible.

00:29.597 --> 00:34.001
Yes, I am going to try
to be extra responsible now.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.469
Yeah.

00:38.339 --> 00:42.476
W-We -- We have to talk
about what we...want to do.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.878
I love you.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.214
I want a child.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.815
So I want this child.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.418
I love you, too.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.521
And I do want kids,
but it's complicated.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.057
Is this the right time
in my career?

00:57.191 --> 00:59.193
In our relationship?

00:59.327 --> 01:00.561
Am I too young?

01:00.694 --> 01:01.829
Can we afford this?

01:01.962 --> 01:04.365
Am I willing to make
this commitment right now?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.400
We can start
depositing money

01:06.534 --> 01:08.302
into a shared account
for expenses,

01:08.436 --> 01:10.404
and I can talk to Dr. Glassman
about hiring you an assistant

01:10.538 --> 01:11.605
to help
with your workload --

01:11.739 --> 01:12.906
Shaun, just slow down.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.209
I-I don't need you
to answer these questions now.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.711
I just need to...think.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.013
To figure out what to do.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.882
And you do, too.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.518
****

01:27.321 --> 01:28.889
Dr. Chambers,
I'd like you to meet
a few of our residents.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.124
This is Doctor --
I know that I'm old,

01:30.258 --> 01:32.693
but I can still read
name tags.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.263
Dr. Chambers, you started
experiencing aches

01:35.396 --> 01:37.064
in your right hand
a month ago?

01:37.198 --> 01:39.433
Then tremors, weakness,
spasms.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.735
Had to drop out in the middle
of a bowel resection
last Friday.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.471
I sent you a video
of the surgery.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.072
Given your symptoms, it seems
that carpal tunnel --

01:45.206 --> 01:47.107
Oh, it "seems."

01:47.241 --> 01:49.610
(CHUCKLING)
Well, then, problem solved.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.479
I'll be on my way.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.547
Sir, can I just say
that the documentary

01:53.681 --> 01:55.849
on your work in Haiti
changed my life.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.451
It's the reason
why I went into --

01:57.585 --> 01:59.920
If you want to suck up to me,
call me "doctor," not "sir."

02:00.053 --> 02:01.955
And this is a hospital,
not Coachella.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.557
If you can't wear
something appropriate,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.893
at least try something
that fits.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.128
(SIGHS)

02:08.262 --> 02:10.298
(PAPER RUSTLES)

02:10.431 --> 02:13.066
Rule out autoimmune disorders,
hypothyroidism,

02:13.201 --> 02:16.404
diabetes, amyloidosis, MS,
and multiple myeloma.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.606
Then we'll get back
to carpal tunnel.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.809
Alright.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.143
If you have
any other questions
or concerns,

02:23.277 --> 02:24.245
please don't hesitate --

02:24.378 --> 02:25.613
Twelve.

02:25.746 --> 02:29.217
First, I prefer blankets
not made of sandpaper.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.585
Second,
dim these damn lights.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.422
This isn't some
San Fernando Valley
porn shoot.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.756
Third --
SHAUN: If you made a list,

02:35.889 --> 02:37.291
you don't need
to tell us.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.297
He's had the pain
for nine months now.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.432
ASHER:
And it's on both sides?

02:44.565 --> 02:46.434
Mm-hmm.
Sometimes his forehead,

02:46.567 --> 02:48.001
other times his cheeks,
his nose.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.638
And it's persisting through
very high doses
of hydrocodone.

02:50.771 --> 02:51.972
Yeah, obviously,
the drugs don't work.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.106
It's why I'm here.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.475
ANA: Oscar.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.109
It's a fair question.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.679
Look, I'm sorry.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.048
Okay, I've been
to six doctors now.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.816
I can't work.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.319
I mean, I-I c--
I can't even kiss my wife.

03:05.453 --> 03:06.554
I can hardly smile.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.489
I'm just gonna lightly brush
your cheek.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.560
(GROANS)

03:12.693 --> 03:14.194
Okay.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.129
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:16.264 --> 03:18.632
Please...help me.

03:18.766 --> 03:23.036
****

03:23.170 --> 03:24.238
I've been on the phone
for like an hour

03:24.372 --> 03:25.205
with the cable company --

03:25.339 --> 03:26.674
Lea's pregnant.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.650
You want to have...

03:37.150 --> 03:38.786
Yes.

03:38.919 --> 03:39.987
Wow.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.055
(CHUCKLES)

03:42.189 --> 03:43.491
I'm glad you're happy.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.327
Um, do you have
any concerns?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.161
Yes.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.863
Sleep deprivation.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.866
But I have started
looking into
an affordable night nurse.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.604
Well, there's gonna be
some bigger issues.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.339
I mean, this is a...

03:58.472 --> 03:59.873
(LAUGHS)

04:00.007 --> 04:03.511
This is a gigantic moment
for anyone,

04:03.644 --> 04:06.213
especially --
especially for you.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.349
You mean

04:08.482 --> 04:09.683
because of my ASD?

04:09.817 --> 04:10.884
Yeah,
because of your ASD.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.553
Because of your family.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.390
Your job.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.025
I mean...
(CHUCKLES)

04:18.158 --> 04:20.227
A million things.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.463
I don't want to tell you
what -- what to --

04:22.596 --> 04:23.697
I mean, I don't even know
what I...

04:27.401 --> 04:28.902
Having a child

04:31.104 --> 04:33.574
changes everything.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.943

04:44.585 --> 04:48.722
****

04:48.856 --> 04:52.526
(WHIRRING)

04:52.660 --> 04:54.428
ASHER:
Nasal cavity's clear.

04:54.562 --> 04:58.298
There's no abscess,
facial tumor, or sinusitis.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.434
It could be
acoustic neuroma.

05:00.568 --> 05:01.902
Without
any hearing loss?

05:02.035 --> 05:03.337
Let's do an MRI
to check.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.304
We've run eight negative tests
already.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.973
We don't need a ninth.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.240
We do the tests
till we know what he has.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.109
It's fibromyalgia.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.744
So, your diagnosis
for his pain

05:10.878 --> 05:12.780
is "pain that no one
can explain"?

05:12.913 --> 05:15.383
Well done.
Some pain's unavoidable.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.884
When I was competing
in Tae Kwon Do,

05:17.017 --> 05:19.286
they taught us to adjust
our relationship to it,

05:19.420 --> 05:20.454
learn to tolerate it.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.722
It can make you stronger.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.091
Wow. That statement has
the absolute ideal ratio

05:24.224 --> 05:25.926
of heartlessness,
humble-bragging, and machismo.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.094
Bravo.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.497
Seriously?
You're pleased with that?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.131
"Machismo," Spanish,
"bravo"'s Italian.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.833
And "humble-bragging"'s 2011.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.335
We can do better,
don't you think?

05:35.469 --> 05:39.306
Maybe we're not
finding anything
because it's psychological?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.942
Some kind of
conversion disorder?

05:43.577 --> 05:44.645
You do the MRI.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.746
I'll talk to the wife.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.648
****

05:47.781 --> 05:50.050
Negative
for endocrine issues.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.554
He's got a history
of moderate carotid stenosis.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.155
If enough plaque
builds up,

05:55.288 --> 05:56.490
starves the brain
of oxygen,

05:56.624 --> 05:58.125
maybe could cause
the hand problems.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.794
If it got that bad,
we'd have already
seen signs of a stroke.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.195
ENRIQUE: Anyone else annoyed
that we're wasting

06:02.329 --> 06:04.965
all these resources to confirm
what's clearly carpal tunnel?

06:05.098 --> 06:07.601
He may be a jerk,
but he's a great doctor.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.069
If Silas Chambers has
a medical opinion,

06:09.202 --> 06:10.438
we better check it out.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.805
I didn't think
he was a jerk.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.645
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim
also criticize us

06:17.778 --> 06:19.513
and have
particular demands.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.449
Yeah.
They want us to improve.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.884
How do you know
Dr. Chambers doesn't?

06:24.017 --> 06:25.385
He did improve Enrique.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.188
Not kidding.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.990
You look snazzy.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.826
****

06:36.530 --> 06:39.032
I know
what Dr. Chambers has.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.535
We're having trouble finding
a physical basis

06:41.669 --> 06:42.470
for your husband's pain.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.574
And you defended me
when I asked him

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
about painkillers earlier.

06:55.983 --> 07:00.053
A few years ago,
Oscar was on a job site.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.655
Working crazy hours.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.356
He was exhausted.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.594
He shot himself with a --
with a nail gun.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.128
Right through his palm.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.898
We didn't have insurance,

07:11.031 --> 07:15.035
so we went to this clinic,
and, um...

07:15.168 --> 07:16.870
Opioids?

07:18.338 --> 07:19.940
Really bad.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.576
Took a year
for him to kick.

07:24.211 --> 07:28.716
Now, um...he's taking
more pills than ever.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.253
Whenever I talk to him
about getting help,

07:33.386 --> 07:35.255
he just gets mad.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.891
I, uh...

07:38.025 --> 07:40.460
I had to move out
last week.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.897
I'm only here
because he asked me to.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.503
I think he's faking.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.106
(SIGHS)

07:53.240 --> 07:57.177
You threw 113 sutures
in your last day of surgery.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.681
In at least half, I detected
a very subtle tremor.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.251
Congratulations on discovering
a symptom I told you about.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.186
It occurs during the part
of your stitch

08:06.319 --> 08:08.822
when the wrist is straight,
not when it's bent.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.558
That is not carpal tunnel.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.626
It is musician's dystonia.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.928
My wrist flexes
on every suture.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.997
You're talking about
a difference of milliseconds.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.766
Yes, he is.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.500
Your condition
was probably caused

08:20.634 --> 08:22.102
by your repetitive technique.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.072
Even Dr. Andrews
throws sutures
in varied ways.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.840
You never do.
This kind of
obsessive behavior

08:26.974 --> 08:29.042
is common
for those with autism.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.277
So, I can refer --

08:30.410 --> 08:31.344
What did you just say?

08:34.615 --> 08:35.783
I'm not autistic.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.893
ANDREWS: Dr. Murphy
didn't mean any offense.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.828
He himself
is on the spectrum.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.462
Oh, is he?

08:49.597 --> 08:52.232
I thought his robotic voice
and hand clasping

08:52.365 --> 08:54.234
were just
charming affectations.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.337
Do you really think
I am anything like him?

08:57.470 --> 08:58.305
I'm not saying that --

08:58.438 --> 08:59.740
I am.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.474
You're extremely organized.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.110
You hardly make eye contact.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.312
And given your problems
with food, blankets,

09:05.445 --> 09:07.915
and lighting, plus the fact
you wear headphones
even in surgery,

09:08.048 --> 09:09.516
you clearly have
sensory issues.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.719
I'm organized.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.054
Would you rather I show up
in the O.R. and just wing it?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.555
I have good taste
in food and music.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.224
Now that's
a mental disorder?

09:18.225 --> 09:19.993
And as
for eye contact...

09:22.630 --> 09:24.497
Okay.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.499
I didn't come here
for a psych consult.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.970
It was just an observation
about a possible reason

09:30.103 --> 09:32.105
for the behavior that led
to your hand symptoms,

09:32.239 --> 09:34.241
which is what we should
be talking about.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.177
Physical therapy is
the recommended course
for dystonia.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.013
I'm not wasting months
on a treatment
that won't work.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.182
I want an MRI-guided
ultrasound ablation

09:42.315 --> 09:44.217
of the VO nucleus
of the thalamus.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.890
You want to jump
to brain surgery?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.192
I would jump
right to amputating a toe

09:52.325 --> 09:54.227
if it got me
my career back.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.803
ANDREWS:
What were you thinking?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.772
You just supported me.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.574
Yes, because part of my job
is not yelling at residents

10:07.708 --> 10:09.209
in front of patients.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.879
What you did is equivalent
to looking at a fuzzy MRI

10:12.012 --> 10:13.580
and blurting out
a patient has cancer.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.215
Cancer can kill you.

10:17.584 --> 10:21.054
Neither diagnosis is one
a patient is excited to hear.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.792
Prep him
for the ablation.

about autism.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.969
He's seen six doctors
in the last month,

10:36.103 --> 10:37.370
gotten three
opioid prescriptions,

10:37.504 --> 10:39.239
and he had
a previous opioid problem.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.974
It's textbook
drug-seeking.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.110
It's also textbook
"a bunch of dingbats

10:43.243 --> 10:45.045
missing a trigeminal neuralgia
diagnosis."

10:45.178 --> 10:46.914
Mm, his wife agrees with me.
She knows him.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.481
Would explain why yours
left you.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.118
Snap. Except my wife
didn't leave me,

10:51.251 --> 10:53.253
so neither a good point,
nor even a clever one.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.455
FIESTA imaging would
take hours to set up,

10:55.588 --> 10:56.656
cost the patient
serious money,

10:56.790 --> 10:58.091
and still come out
negative.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.722
Like, what if I suck
at changing diapers?

11:28.856 --> 11:31.124
Maybe we should start
with the bigger issues

11:31.258 --> 11:32.993
and work our way down.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.730
This isn't
at the top of my list,

you are a doctor...

is it...?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.136
Inheritable?

11:45.172 --> 11:46.774
Probably.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.441
But it's unclear
how much.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.710
So, even that.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.813
W-What am I supposed to do
with that?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.514
Think it through.

a little baby Shaun.

my life would be worse,

Not that
I was really planning,

wondering

12:59.980 --> 13:01.381
which of them went
the wrong way.

he has dystonia?

He does,

His vertebral artery takes
an aberrant course.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.046
It is pressing against
his spinal cord.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.713
He needs vascular surgery
or he'll die.

It's a disorder of the nerve
that carries sensation

14:46.153 --> 14:47.820

to the brain.

of your skull

to cushion the affected nerve.

Mm, that would carry
a very high risk
for a stroke or bleed.

His decision
may be irrational,

Why can't you treat people
with just an ounce of respect?

20:38.004 --> 20:41.308
Respect has to be earned,
not doled out like candy.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.577

your garbage behavior.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.615
to avoid facing reality.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.618
No one was respectful to me
when I was a resident.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.887
They were dismissive
and cruel.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.924
But it lit a fire
and it made me
the man I am today.

into my room idolizing.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.743
But if we are both
having doubts,

35:11.877 --> 35:16.848
then maybe now isn't
the right time.

35:16.982 --> 35:21.553
****

35:22.120 --> 35:23.555
Okay.

35:23.689 --> 35:29.828
****

35:29.961 --> 35:35.434
****

35:36.868 --> 35:38.470
(SIGHS)

35:42.007 --> 35:48.580
****

35:51.417 --> 35:58.424
****

36:00.626 --> 36:07.266
****

36:09.901 --> 36:11.403
Mm.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.804
I see that
my hemoglobin's stable

36:12.938 --> 36:15.441
and my white count
is fine.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.009
Yeah. We just wrote
your discharge orders.

36:18.143 --> 36:21.313
This is a referral
for an ASD specialist.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.284
I can look into that
on my own.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.465
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.270
And thank you,
Dr. Guerin.

36:46.472 --> 36:53.479
****

36:55.547 --> 36:56.815
Welcome back.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.317
Mm.

36:58.450 --> 37:04.022
****

37:04.155 --> 37:05.657
Did it work?

37:06.692 --> 37:07.893
Let's find out.

37:08.026 --> 37:15.033
****

37:15.601 --> 37:16.668
(SIGHS)

37:18.537 --> 37:20.539
Mm.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.244
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

37:27.979 --> 37:28.947
Your hand's cold.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.083
(CHUCKLES)

37:32.217 --> 37:36.455
****

37:38.757 --> 37:44.696
****

37:46.798 --> 37:48.900
I'm transferring out.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.603
Last year, I applied to
a program at Johns Hopkins.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.104
They train doctors
to travel the world,

37:53.238 --> 37:55.507
help out needy areas.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.075
They'll let me
enroll late.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.779
Sounds like a good place
for you.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.317
Thanks for always being
a great boss.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.252
And a great friend.

38:07.386 --> 38:10.489
Can't have been that great,
sneaking out like this.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.793
Uh, actually,
for the first time
I can remember,

38:14.926 --> 38:17.062
it felt hard
to say goodbye.

38:17.195 --> 38:21.933
****

38:22.067 --> 38:27.238
****

38:27.373 --> 38:29.575
You're always doing so much
for other people.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.077
Please don't forget to do
something for yourself

38:32.210 --> 38:33.178
every now and then.

38:33.311 --> 38:38.249
****

38:40.218 --> 38:46.925
****

38:49.094 --> 38:56.101
****

38:56.234 --> 38:57.769
Were you messing with me
or not?

38:58.570 --> 39:04.376
****

39:04.510 --> 39:06.612
If I was,
would you let me stay?

39:10.982 --> 39:11.783
Yes.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.789
I wasn't messing
with you.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.931
Then I guess it's good
we're not roommates anymore.

39:26.064 --> 39:29.468
****

39:30.469 --> 39:32.003
'Cause
I couldn't do this.

39:32.137 --> 39:35.807
****

39:35.941 --> 39:38.076
This is
a one-time thing.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.578
Unless I change my mind.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.380
So consider that
an incentive.

39:44.950 --> 39:49.521
** We get by
on love and faith **

39:51.523 --> 39:56.828
** We get by with a smile
on our face **

39:58.964 --> 40:03.835
** We get by with help
from our kin **

40:05.804 --> 40:11.209
** We get by through thick
and through thin **

40:12.644 --> 40:14.880
** We get by **

40:16.347 --> 40:18.884
** We get by **

40:19.017 --> 40:22.253
** No matter what happens,
I'll be there for you **

40:22.387 --> 40:25.657
** We get by **

40:28.894 --> 40:31.497
** Was just the other day **

40:31.630 --> 40:33.298
** I heard
from my old friend **

40:33.431 --> 40:35.033
Lea Dilallo?

40:36.201 --> 40:39.805
** She was going
through changes **

40:39.938 --> 40:42.574
** Once again **

40:42.708 --> 40:46.411
** Matters of the head **

40:46.545 --> 40:49.447
** Matters of the heart **

40:49.581 --> 40:52.417
** May be too early to tell **

40:52.551 --> 40:53.619
** But it's never too late
to start **

40:53.752 --> 40:56.087
She called your name.

40:57.422 --> 41:01.059
** We get by **

41:01.192 --> 41:02.494
** We get by **

41:02.628 --> 41:06.231
I spent all day
reminding myself
of all the reasons

41:06.364 --> 41:08.967
why this was a good idea.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.737
** We get by **

41:11.870 --> 41:13.505
But now that
it's actually happening,

41:13.639 --> 41:16.908
it...doesn't make me feel
any better.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.244
It just makes me feel
really sad.

41:19.377 --> 41:23.549
****

41:24.550 --> 41:27.085
** Day by day **

41:27.218 --> 41:30.221
Maybe it's not the right time,
but will it ever be?

41:30.355 --> 41:34.192
** If you don't have yours **

41:35.060 --> 41:38.029
** You sure got mine **

41:38.163 --> 41:40.331
** We get by **

41:40.465 --> 41:41.466
** We get by day by day **

41:41.600 --> 41:43.201
I...

41:45.070 --> 41:46.037
** We get by **

41:46.171 --> 41:47.639
...feel the same.

41:47.773 --> 41:51.710
** In our own way **

41:52.377 --> 41:53.344
** We get by **

41:53.478 --> 41:55.513
Are we really
doing this?

41:56.582 --> 41:59.084
** We get by **

41:59.217 --> 42:00.351
** No matter how it happens **
We...

42:00.485 --> 42:01.519
** I'll be there for you **

42:01.653 --> 42:03.655
...are having a baby.

42:03.789 --> 42:04.956
** We get by **

42:06.692 --> 42:07.726
** We get by **

42:07.859 --> 42:08.960
Mm.

42:10.495 --> 42:11.697
** We get by **

42:11.830 --> 42:13.064
Yes.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.499
** No matter how long **

42:14.633 --> 42:16.067
** I'll be waiting
here for you **

42:16.201 --> 42:17.502
(BOTH LAUGH)

42:17.636 --> 42:20.038
** We get by **

42:20.171 --> 42:21.940
** No matter what happens **
Yeah?

42:22.073 --> 42:23.274
Okay.

42:23.408 --> 42:24.475
Okay.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.845
** I'll be there for you **
