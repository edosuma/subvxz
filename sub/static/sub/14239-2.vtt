contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:18.635 --> 00:20.035
Yes!

00:25.435 --> 00:28.475
That is the last
time you choose a film.

00:28.475 --> 00:30.676
I was told it was good.
I feel asleep, Rhys.

00:34.436 --> 00:36.195
What does it mean, "Special Ops"?

00:36.195 --> 00:39.075
It's no big deal. Mostly filing.

00:39.075 --> 00:40.795
Special admin, really.

00:40.795 --> 00:43.675
Can we talk about something else?
Oh, come on,

00:43.675 --> 00:47.315
it's your first day tomorrow,
I'm excited for you! Big promotion.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.836
Secondment. You'll be brilliant.

00:55.036 --> 00:58.076
Let's have an early night.
Check, please!

01:00.675 --> 01:03.716
Bloody hell! Is that plane on fire?

01:07.675 --> 01:08.795
It's not a plane.

01:12.995 --> 01:15.475
We haven't paid. Come on.

01:35.836 --> 01:38.795
What was that?

01:38.795 --> 01:40.636
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS

01:48.835 --> 01:50.435
I've got to go to work.

02:10.636 --> 02:15.436
Simple locating clean up operation.
Find that meteorite before
anyone else gets their hands on it.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.116
Good to see you, by the way.

02:20.995 --> 02:23.836
Tosh, you found it yet?
You got enough kit?

02:23.836 --> 02:25.876
Basic tracking and surveillance.

02:25.876 --> 02:27.595
The crash site.

02:27.595 --> 02:31.276
With this we can tap into CCTV
networks, national databases.

02:31.276 --> 02:35.636
This is the police computer system.
You shouldn't have this!

02:35.636 --> 02:39.476
Might wanna stop saying "you"
and start saying "we".

02:51.916 --> 02:54.476
Crash site is 100 metres ahead.

02:58.156 --> 03:00.195
Shit.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.956
The amateurs got here first.

03:17.435 --> 03:20.435
All right. Usual formation.

03:20.435 --> 03:22.235
What's the usual formation?

03:22.235 --> 03:25.835
Varies.
How can a usual formation vary?

03:39.196 --> 03:41.155
Who the hell are you?!

03:41.155 --> 03:44.956
Sorry! This area's restricted.
No, it's all right, I'm with...

03:44.956 --> 03:47.876
Special Ops. I'm Special Ops.

03:47.876 --> 03:52.636
Torchwood. I'm with Torchwood.
Don't mess with me, little girl.

03:52.636 --> 03:55.396
You're not with Torchwood.
And even if you were...

03:55.396 --> 03:58.196
You'd have put out
the welcome banners!

03:58.196 --> 04:00.035
First of all, she's no little girl.

04:00.035 --> 04:02.395
All the right curves
in all the right places.

04:02.395 --> 04:05.195
But she is Torchwood. We both are.
We'd appreciate it

04:05.195 --> 04:07.756
if you'd leave us
to do the real work.

04:08.835 --> 04:10.955
Shall we?

04:14.435 --> 04:18.476
So let's see what we came for.

04:36.755 --> 04:40.315
What do we know?
Bog standard space debris.

04:40.315 --> 04:43.316
That's a technical term.
Yeah, thanks.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.716
So take all the readings
and let's get out of here.

05:03.515 --> 05:05.596
Make yourself useful, sweetheart!

05:05.596 --> 05:09.755
Pass us the big chisel from the
toolbox. Not sweetheart - Gwen.

05:09.755 --> 05:14.915
One syllable, sure you can manage it.
Not sweetcheeks? Freckles? New Girl?

05:16.996 --> 05:20.195
It's a shame your tool's not
big enough for the job, darlin'.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.715
Catch! Don't! Shit!

05:33.395 --> 05:34.715
Put this on!

06:14.636 --> 06:18.395
Is this all I get now,
your voicemail?

06:18.395 --> 06:20.236
You're out with her, aren't you?

06:20.236 --> 06:22.996
You bastard, you could've
had the decency to text.

06:22.996 --> 06:25.435
I've been standin' in
there all on my own.

06:25.435 --> 06:30.676
I'm sick of this hanging around
all of the time waiting for you to
show up. I wish I'd never met you.

06:30.676 --> 06:33.756
I wish I was dead, no,
I wish you were dead.

06:33.756 --> 06:35.875
Call me back.

07:02.395 --> 07:06.356
Hiya. Evening, ladies.
Hiya, handsome.

07:08.075 --> 07:09.795
Very nice.

07:11.355 --> 07:13.316
Where do you think you're going?

07:13.316 --> 07:15.515
I've been in once,
I came out to make a call.

07:15.515 --> 07:17.275
There's no readmission.

07:24.716 --> 07:29.116
Um, OK, then, on you go.

07:34.595 --> 07:36.195
Watch and learn, boys.

08:19.075 --> 08:22.196
I don't even know your name.

08:22.196 --> 08:24.155
Overrated, names.

08:43.316 --> 08:46.676
I don't think...I can...hold on.

08:46.676 --> 08:49.915
Well, go on, then.

08:49.915 --> 08:55.355
Go on...you're...this
is...the best... Oh!

08:56.915 --> 08:58.996
HE MOANS

09:17.675 --> 09:20.476
I'm so sorry.
Seriously, stop saying that.

09:20.476 --> 09:26.435
But I am! I mean, really,
I mean really, really sorry.

09:26.435 --> 09:31.436
God, I can't believe it.
Didn't they teach you
Health and Safety in the police?

09:31.436 --> 09:33.556
You chucked tools
at each other, so...

09:33.556 --> 09:36.515
We didn't miss. I'll sort it.

09:36.515 --> 09:40.235
Whatever's happened, I'll deal with
it. What d'you think has happened?

09:40.235 --> 09:42.235
I mean, it was just gas, wasn't it?

09:42.235 --> 09:45.236
That can't be too bad, can it?

09:45.236 --> 09:48.636
Right, because gas never
did anyone any harm(!)

09:48.636 --> 09:52.155
On the plus side, we've got good
evidence, relatively undamaged.

09:52.155 --> 09:55.115
On the downside,
there's an alien on the loose,

09:55.115 --> 09:58.115
we don't know where it is, why
it's here or what it's going to do.

09:58.115 --> 10:01.475
Give her a break! God, this has
been the worst first day ever.

10:01.475 --> 10:07.036
We all make mistakes.
Now we find and recover
whatever came out of there.

10:07.036 --> 10:11.075
This might help. Nightclub death
been phoned into 999.

10:11.075 --> 10:16.035
Circumstances sound...
a little unusual.

10:16.035 --> 10:18.235
Might be connected.

10:34.316 --> 10:35.795
Torchwood.

10:40.315 --> 10:43.036
Gwen? Hi!

10:43.036 --> 10:47.156
Bloody hell! Look at you, all posh.

10:47.156 --> 10:50.315
Special ops! We were wondering.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.676
I meant to call.

10:51.676 --> 10:55.316
It's been a bit of a whirlwind.
Go on, then, tell us all. Coming?

10:55.316 --> 10:57.916
Yeah, sorry.

10:57.916 --> 11:02.076
You can get away now. No point you
freezing your arse off out here.

11:02.076 --> 11:03.836
Boss of me now, are you?

11:07.276 --> 11:11.075
Say hi to everyone for me.

11:13.196 --> 11:15.715
This is all that's left?

11:15.715 --> 11:21.436
How's that possible?
The question is how did you
know this used to be a body?

11:23.116 --> 11:27.075
Go on, son! With you all the way!

11:35.915 --> 11:39.436
Bit of a shock, I tell you.

11:39.436 --> 11:42.275
We need to see that CCTV.

11:49.715 --> 11:53.475
Wow. Oh, my God!
He just... Came and went.

11:54.595 --> 11:56.195
That's the way I'd like to go.

11:56.195 --> 11:58.755
I'm sure we could arrange it.
How can that be?

11:58.755 --> 12:01.235
It doesn't make any sense.

12:01.235 --> 12:05.195
It's not possible.
Do you know the girl's name?

12:05.195 --> 12:07.715
Did they arrive together
or meet in the club?

12:07.715 --> 12:11.636
Is she a regular? Would any of the
other staff know her? I dunno!

12:11.636 --> 12:14.195
We get hundreds of people
here every weekend.

12:14.195 --> 12:17.516
I don't keep tabs.
Thanks for your help.

12:17.516 --> 12:18.796
We've got all we need.

12:20.716 --> 12:25.835
What are you talking about?
We haven't got a clue.
We don't even know her name!

12:25.835 --> 12:29.755
We need a body from the
cryo-chamber, close match
for the dead guy.

12:29.755 --> 12:34.196
Disfigure the face,
dump it someplace remote, make
it look like a suicide attempt.

12:34.196 --> 12:35.596
You have a stash of bodies?

12:41.516 --> 12:42.836
What about his family?

12:42.836 --> 12:45.915
You can't just fake his death.
You want to tell his family

12:45.915 --> 12:48.755
he died screwing an alien?
We don't know for sure.

12:48.755 --> 12:51.075
Same elements recorded
at the crash site.

12:51.075 --> 12:54.116
Traces all over the club
but strongest in this area.

12:54.116 --> 12:55.516
Something happened here.

13:12.476 --> 13:15.036
It's my fault.

13:15.036 --> 13:17.436
If it weren't for me,
he'd still be alive.

13:17.436 --> 13:19.796
That'll get you nowhere,
that thinking.

13:19.796 --> 13:21.836
At least now we know a little more.

13:21.836 --> 13:23.915
The alien's taken on a host body.

13:23.915 --> 13:26.836
We can't let her kill again.

13:37.876 --> 13:41.916
I said to them, you're putting
yourselves out of work,
behaving like this.

13:41.916 --> 13:45.035
I can get five Polish lads
who don't take any breaks,

13:45.035 --> 13:48.596
happy as sand boys,
all for 56 quid above board.

13:48.596 --> 13:53.195
I told Niall, I said, "Why should
I bother with your moaning mates
when I can get this?"

13:53.195 --> 13:57.196
Carys? Dad?

13:57.836 --> 13:59.915
Hangover from hell, is it?

13:59.915 --> 14:02.195
What did you get up to last night?

14:02.195 --> 14:04.476
I can't really remember.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.035
Mullered, I was.

14:06.035 --> 14:07.876
Gotta go.

14:09.236 --> 14:10.996
Tony needs the van by nine.

14:13.756 --> 14:15.275
You in tonight?

14:27.275 --> 14:31.395
What's this supposed to do?
I'm using satellite-tracking data

14:31.395 --> 14:34.275
to determine the inward trajectory
of the meteorite.

14:34.275 --> 14:37.595
He means he's trying to find
out where it's came from.

14:37.595 --> 14:41.155
Sometimes techno babble
is good for the soul.
So this is a route planner.

14:41.155 --> 14:42.796
Not far off.

14:42.796 --> 14:46.516
Rhys, my boyfriend, is a transport
manager. He does this sort of stuff.

14:46.516 --> 14:49.955
On a slightly smaller scale, though.
You have a boyfriend?

14:49.955 --> 14:53.516
Yeah. Have you?
Don't have time with this job.

14:55.115 --> 14:58.595
What about you? You seeing anyone?
You've gotta be joking.

14:58.595 --> 15:01.196
I can get all the grief I need here.

15:01.196 --> 15:02.596
None of you have partners?

15:02.596 --> 15:04.476
Just you, newbie.

15:06.155 --> 15:11.395
I'm not being rude or anything...
Well, maybe I am, but...

15:11.395 --> 15:14.156
how do you
switch off from all this stuff?

15:14.156 --> 15:16.276
What do you do to relax?

15:22.075 --> 15:24.596
I torture people
in happy relationships.

15:29.356 --> 15:32.756
SHE SOBS

15:41.396 --> 15:43.875
Gas traces confirmed
as Vorax and Suranium.

15:43.875 --> 15:48.076
My two favourite gases.
Can we do a check, and find
out what we know about them?

15:48.076 --> 15:50.275
I'm all over it. What's this doing?

15:50.275 --> 15:54.995
I've taken an image of the girl
from the CCTV. This cross-checks
her face with the UK population.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.355
You can't have every
face in the UK on there.

15:57.355 --> 16:00.556
That would be against
civil liberties, data protection...

16:00.556 --> 16:02.996
Still doing that "you"
instead of "we" thing.

16:02.996 --> 16:06.676
119 suspects.

16:06.676 --> 16:09.035
It's supposed
to give us a single match.

16:09.035 --> 16:13.635
The CCTV was too low res.
I've tried magnifying and
augmenting but it just breaks up.

16:13.635 --> 16:17.475
The software can't function
properly. It's narrowed
the numbers down.

16:17.475 --> 16:22.036
I could check through the rest. The
old fashioned way - with my eyes.

16:23.396 --> 16:26.996
What about the fingerprints
I took off the alley wall?

16:28.835 --> 16:32.236
It was a long-shot, anyway.
Just a bit.

16:32.236 --> 16:35.156
Least I'm trying to do something.
You're trying anything.

16:35.156 --> 16:38.315
The CCTV must have picked up
her arrival at the club.

16:38.315 --> 16:41.636
Tosh, can you reformat the
image recognition software

16:41.636 --> 16:44.596
to trace her journey backwards
via street cameras?

16:44.596 --> 16:46.316
It'll take a while to process.

16:46.316 --> 16:50.036
Every possible turn means
thousands of probabilities.

16:50.036 --> 16:52.995
Have a go. At least we'll
know where she started.

16:52.995 --> 16:56.756
We could cross reference that
with the remaining face matches.

16:56.756 --> 16:59.276
Good one, newbie!
That's a bit more like it!

17:05.435 --> 17:06.714
Ah!

17:20.516 --> 17:21.635
Ah!

17:35.396 --> 17:37.435
No!

17:40.636 --> 17:42.316
DOORBELL RINGS

17:44.236 --> 17:47.596
You're keeping our website
in business.

17:48.755 --> 17:50.836
Well, your, er, dad's not in, then?

17:50.836 --> 17:53.435
Get your clothes off!
Steady, Carys!

17:56.195 --> 17:57.916
All right, that's enough.

17:57.916 --> 18:00.916
Joke over. Barry's
put you up to this, has he? Shut up!

18:07.395 --> 18:11.756
What's going on?! Put your
trousers on and get out. NOW!

18:14.156 --> 18:18.556
It always breaks my heart to
say those words. Air quality's OK.

18:20.555 --> 18:23.315
Gwen, look out!

18:29.236 --> 18:32.156
What's that?
It's a sort of inflatable cell.

18:32.156 --> 18:35.235
Power runs down after an hour.
The battery life's bollocks.

18:35.235 --> 18:38.795
Who said you could use that? Um,
I just stopped a prisoner escaping.

18:38.795 --> 18:43.195
You know the rules. None of
that stuff leaves the building
without my permission.

18:43.195 --> 18:44.355
Fine. Don't thank me.

18:50.435 --> 18:51.916
Come with us.

19:12.116 --> 19:15.875
See what you can find out from her.
But aren't you going to help me?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.675
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:17.675 --> 19:21.076
Usually better if you don't say
that in front of the prisoner.

19:34.955 --> 19:36.475
Are you MI5?

19:39.916 --> 19:43.156
Where am I? What do you want?

19:43.156 --> 19:45.436
I think you know, Carys.

19:45.436 --> 19:50.275
How d'you know my name?
I've never been in trouble.

19:50.275 --> 19:52.276
What do you want from me?

19:53.955 --> 19:56.635
I know there's something
living inside you

19:56.635 --> 20:03.516
and I know what it made
you do. His name was Matt Stevens.

20:03.516 --> 20:07.196
His parents lost their only
child at 3:07 this morning.

20:07.196 --> 20:10.475
Ah! Ah!

20:26.276 --> 20:28.396
You broke my ship.

20:30.115 --> 20:34.475
Come on then. Where are you from

20:34.475 --> 20:38.196
and why are you trying to invade
earth? You can forget
about enslaving us.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.556
Who said anything about enslaving?

20:40.556 --> 20:47.276
Well, that's what you
lot do. Aliens. Isn't it?

20:47.276 --> 20:52.396
No, I just want the energy.

20:52.396 --> 20:53.955
The climax.

20:55.475 --> 20:57.475
I live off that energy.

20:59.476 --> 21:01.835
Right, sorry, just to recap.

21:01.835 --> 21:04.556
You've travelled here
to feed off orgasmic energy?

21:04.556 --> 21:08.116
There's nothing else
out there like it.

21:08.116 --> 21:10.115
You taste so good.

21:10.115 --> 21:16.355
You're the best hit there is.
Ah! Ah! No!

21:24.835 --> 21:26.755
Help me

21:26.755 --> 21:30.715
Please, get it out of me.

21:36.156 --> 21:38.236
Carys?

21:46.916 --> 21:48.395
Hel-lo.

21:48.395 --> 21:50.036
Happy birthday, me.

21:53.436 --> 21:56.956
OK, first contact with an alien.

21:56.956 --> 21:58.915
Not quite what I expected.

22:03.875 --> 22:07.396
Oi, you lot...treat!

22:10.676 --> 22:13.675
Whoa. Wow.

22:13.675 --> 22:15.316
She said she had a boyfriend.

22:15.316 --> 22:18.916
You people and your
quaint little categories.

22:18.916 --> 22:21.356
We should really
get her out of there.

22:21.356 --> 22:25.436
Yeah. I mean, yeah! Come on!

22:27.235 --> 22:31.436
Just...record a bit first.

22:34.275 --> 22:37.996
No! It's no good.

22:39.436 --> 22:42.155
It's got to be a man.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.436
Ah! Oh!

22:55.395 --> 22:57.556
I'm losing.

22:57.556 --> 23:00.835
Promise me you'll help me.

23:00.835 --> 23:02.915
Promise me.

23:11.035 --> 23:14.076
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

23:16.156 --> 23:17.275
I promise.

23:20.276 --> 23:22.556
Hi.

23:22.556 --> 23:25.676
You're not still at work? 'Fraid so.

23:25.676 --> 23:29.156
'What time will you be done?'
Not sure when I'll be finished.

23:29.156 --> 23:33.196
Is it exciting, though, have you
had loads of excitement? Erm, some.

23:33.196 --> 23:35.276
Er sorry, yeah, is now a good time?

23:35.276 --> 23:37.076
Em, maybe not the best.

23:37.076 --> 23:39.916
Oh, pity me,
I'm a Special Ops widow.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.155
I'll call you later.

23:42.155 --> 23:43.316
'Bye.'

24:15.316 --> 24:19.436
Way to go, newbie! That is what
I call a methodical investigation.

24:19.436 --> 24:22.115
I can't wait to see
you take down her particulars.

24:22.115 --> 24:25.315
What are you doing?! Get off me!

24:25.315 --> 24:29.475
That girl's body is being
overrun by I don't know what.
And you think it's a joke?

24:29.475 --> 24:32.435
All right! Jesus! I'm sorry.
We should be helping her.

24:32.435 --> 24:34.835
She's not some lab rat.
No, she's a murderer.

24:34.835 --> 24:36.875
You were the one
who wanted her caught.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.715
How come suddenly
she's your best friend?

24:39.715 --> 24:43.916
You know, strictly speaking,
throttling the staff is my job.

24:44.835 --> 24:50.076
So who's for Chinese?

24:52.636 --> 24:54.916
And she said...

24:54.916 --> 24:54.996
"If I'd known that's what he was,
I never would have married him!"

24:54.996 --> 24:59.396
She knew all along!
She didn't care.

25:01.516 --> 25:05.396
Until he started leaving black piles
of mucus in the bathtub.

25:05.396 --> 25:10.875
Always the big giveaway. Aliens
have no sense of household hygiene.

25:10.875 --> 25:16.235
Which reminds me, gotta pee.

25:18.715 --> 25:21.676
So what's he told you? What about?

25:21.676 --> 25:25.915
Himself! You've been here longer
than I have. We were banking on you!

25:25.915 --> 25:30.036
You're a copper, trained to ask
questions. You don't know anything?

25:30.036 --> 25:33.436
Not who he is, not where he's from.
Nothing, except him being gay.

25:33.436 --> 25:36.116
No, he's not. Really, do you think?

25:36.116 --> 25:38.516
Owen does. I don't.

25:38.516 --> 25:39.916
And I don't care.

25:39.916 --> 25:43.436
Period military is not the
dress code of a straight man.

25:43.436 --> 25:46.036
I think it suits him.
Sort of classic.

25:46.036 --> 25:51.116
Exactly! I've watched him
in action. He'll shag
anything if it's gorgeous enough.

25:51.116 --> 25:54.436
We know he's from America, right?
We don't know that for sure.

25:54.436 --> 25:57.595
No US citizen by the name of Jack
Harkness born in the last 50 years.

25:57.595 --> 26:00.635
Maybe his identity's classified.

26:00.635 --> 26:04.916
Used to be something big in the CIA.
That's what I reckon.

26:04.916 --> 26:08.635
He must have his reasons for
wanting to keep things secret.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.676
Sure he has. Doesn't stop me
wanting to know what they are.

26:11.676 --> 26:14.156
WOMAN SOBS

26:14.156 --> 26:17.116
What's that sound?

26:17.116 --> 26:23.076
WOMAN SOBS

26:33.635 --> 26:37.396
What are we doing having Chinese
while a girl fights for her life?

26:37.396 --> 26:42.235
Actually, while we've been eating,
the computers have been running
a full bio-scan on Carys,

26:42.235 --> 26:46.275
profiling her blood, metabolism,
organs, skin, the works.

26:46.275 --> 26:49.795
So we can see what effect
the alien's having on her.
They've also been

26:49.795 --> 26:54.275
taking samples of the air in the
cell so we can analyse changes
in the environment around her.

26:54.275 --> 27:00.836
Now, is that enough,
do you want more?

27:00.836 --> 27:02.236
Cos it gets kinda boring.

27:02.236 --> 27:05.995
You've been hidden down here
too long.

27:05.995 --> 27:10.475
Spending so much time
with the alien stuff, you've
lost what it means to be human.

27:12.156 --> 27:13.876
So remind us.

27:16.276 --> 27:19.555
Tell me what it means to be
human in the 21st century.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.395
All right.

27:54.356 --> 27:59.435
Carys Fletcher,
born 13th November, 1987.

27:59.435 --> 28:02.396
School reports, personnel files
from her temping agency,

28:02.396 --> 28:08.116
swimming badges, reports of
her mother's death in a car crash.

28:08.116 --> 28:12.076
And emails discussing the merits
of Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger.

28:12.076 --> 28:18.595
Why have you done this?
This isn't about meteorites or gases.
We have a trapped girl

28:18.595 --> 28:23.395
and we have to save her.
When I was with her in the cell,
Carys told me she was losing.

28:23.395 --> 28:26.755
We have to find a way
to keep her fighting,

28:26.755 --> 28:29.516
remind her to hold on to who she is.

28:31.436 --> 28:34.036
Have I got something on my face?

28:34.036 --> 28:35.836
No.

28:37.396 --> 28:41.596
Just, it's...brilliant.

28:41.596 --> 28:45.276
You are brilliant.

28:46.996 --> 28:47.996
Thank you.

28:49.715 --> 28:51.755
So we should bring in her dad.

28:51.755 --> 28:55.316
You're kidding. We've got to find
something to connect with her.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.955
Make her fight back. Our priority
is to contain the alien threat.

28:58.955 --> 29:02.556
Not put civilians in a cell with it.
We should be helping her.

29:02.556 --> 29:06.676
If we don't, who will, Jack?
Are you always this awkward?

29:06.676 --> 29:08.716
'You should take a look at this.'

29:10.436 --> 29:15.395
This is the normal chemical
composition of the air in that cell.

29:15.395 --> 29:17.955
And these are the readings
from the last hour.

29:17.955 --> 29:22.115
The alien's secreting
an ultra-powerful blend
of airborne pheromones.

29:22.115 --> 29:26.956
Sex pheromones.
1,000 times more potent than
anything we'd normally experience.

29:26.956 --> 29:28.995
She's a walking aphrodisiac!

29:28.995 --> 29:32.636
I did wonder why I...
Actually, I sort of snogged her.

29:32.636 --> 29:34.755
BOTH: We know.

29:34.755 --> 29:39.515
Now, still wanna
put her father in the cell?

29:39.515 --> 29:42.476
God, no! We can't let any man near...
Owen!

29:46.235 --> 29:48.475
Jack, Carys is out of her cell.

29:48.475 --> 29:51.516
Cheeky bitch took my swipe card!

29:51.516 --> 29:55.636
'I'll deal with it. And tell
Owen he needs to work on those
abs a bit harder.'

29:59.075 --> 30:04.076
I was taking some readings, you
know, keeping an eye on her, and
bang. You got away lightly.

30:04.076 --> 30:08.316
Be thankful she was only
interested in your swipe card.
Are you all right now?

30:08.316 --> 30:10.316
Or are you still feeling
a bit of a cock?

30:16.956 --> 30:18.796
No exit, sorry.

30:31.715 --> 30:34.715
Yeah?
You want a little rough and tumble?

30:35.596 --> 30:37.316
Well, let's make it a fair fight.

30:53.516 --> 30:56.075
You won't stop me.

31:09.475 --> 31:11.795
Put it down! That's worthless
to anyone but me.

31:14.795 --> 31:17.356
Down now! Or I'll shoot.

31:17.356 --> 31:23.876
Says he will but the eyes say he
won't. I'm going. Don't stop me.

31:27.516 --> 31:29.556
Please help me.

31:50.595 --> 31:56.075
Need me to do any attacking, sir?
Appreciate the offer.
Just open the door.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.676
Now give me the jar.

32:03.196 --> 32:05.036
NO!

32:56.875 --> 33:01.475
After all I said,
a severed hand is more important
to you than Carys' life.

33:01.475 --> 33:03.675
You want to prove yourself?

33:03.675 --> 33:09.276
Find her.
Get your old pals in the police to
do something useful for once.

33:09.276 --> 33:11.676
All right, I'll give them a call.

33:11.676 --> 33:13.876
Put out an APB -

33:13.876 --> 33:16.396
woman possessed by gas
knobbing fellas to death.

33:16.396 --> 33:19.516
Oi! You'd better get in here!

33:19.516 --> 33:22.475
So I'm trying to interpret
the results of the bio-scan.

33:22.475 --> 33:26.275
Yeah, but it's just a mess, like
there's no definitive readings.

33:26.275 --> 33:28.956
Because everything in
her body keeps changing,

33:28.956 --> 33:31.036
nothing stays constant.
As soon as you think

33:31.036 --> 33:36.116
you've got something clear, the
metabolic rate, the blood pressure
all goes wild again.

33:36.116 --> 33:39.036
She's fighting the alien
for control of her body.

33:39.036 --> 33:42.035
So anyway, I decided to
do a comparative diagnostic.

33:42.035 --> 33:44.155
Recreate the circumstances,

33:44.155 --> 33:48.355
accelerate the process a little,
see what's gonna happen to Carys.
Yeah, thanks.

33:48.355 --> 33:51.355
I infected the rat with
a combination of the Vorax and

33:51.355 --> 33:54.836
Suranium gas traces we found at
the crash site and the nightclub.

33:54.836 --> 33:56.195
Looks fine so far.

33:56.195 --> 34:00.675
Once the gases start to flow round
the body, the party really starts.

34:03.235 --> 34:08.436
The heart rate triples. The brain
swells, pressing against the skull.

34:08.436 --> 34:11.915
Then the lungs began to shrink,
making it impossible to breathe.

34:11.915 --> 34:15.755
The pressure increases
on all the internal organs until...

34:16.675 --> 34:20.755
Rat jam!
That's what's gonna happen to Carys?

34:20.755 --> 34:24.636
"I'm losing", that's what she said
to me. Right now, it's a struggle

34:24.636 --> 34:28.514
between where Carys ends
and the alien begins.

35:03.116 --> 35:05.075
We have to think like her.

35:05.075 --> 35:08.355
Put ourselves in her place.
It's the only way to find her.

35:08.355 --> 35:11.676
Except we don't know what
her controlling impulse is by now -

35:11.676 --> 35:17.156
Carys or the alien inside. The last
thing I saw was a fight for control.

35:17.156 --> 35:21.076
The overriding factor for the
parasite is to have sex.

35:21.076 --> 35:24.596
It's a survival instinct - that's
bound to be the strongest drive.

35:24.596 --> 35:30.275
All right, so you're Carys.
You're desperate for sex cos that's
what the thing inside you needs,

35:30.275 --> 35:32.956
but you know it will kill.
Where would you go?

35:32.956 --> 35:34.796
I'd come round and shag you.

35:34.796 --> 35:41.036
What?! It's a joke! Can't I have
a joke with my team-mates?
Right now? No.

35:41.036 --> 35:45.795
So what are we talking about?
Brothels? Lap dance clubs?

35:45.795 --> 35:47.435
Anywhere there's eager men?

35:47.435 --> 35:48.596
I know what I'd do.

35:49.876 --> 35:53.635
What the hell are you doing here?
You look a bit wired.

35:53.635 --> 35:57.196
I had to see you. You should've
called. Bethan might've been in.

35:57.196 --> 35:59.555
I could kill you.
I could bloody kill you!

35:59.555 --> 36:05.236
What the hell was that message
you left on my mobile last night?
Sounded like you were off your face.

36:06.396 --> 36:10.595
If I wanted to,
I could kill you...now.

36:10.595 --> 36:14.875
Look, I've told you.

36:14.875 --> 36:19.916
I'm not leaving Bethan.
You're a lovely girl, but
it's just not gonna happen.

36:19.916 --> 36:22.636
You were my first, see.

36:22.636 --> 36:27.155
I never told you
cos I thought you'd laugh.

36:27.155 --> 36:29.036
And you're crap.

36:29.036 --> 36:33.196
All you want is to come and
you don't care what's underneath.

36:33.196 --> 36:35.596
Go on, have a go.
Get it out of your system. Ah!

36:46.396 --> 36:48.395
Do you love me, Eddie?

36:49.876 --> 36:53.836
Did you ever love me? No.

36:53.836 --> 36:57.315
You could've saved yourself.

36:57.315 --> 36:58.715
What?

37:06.876 --> 37:08.635
We're too late.

37:08.635 --> 37:11.435
Tosh was right, though.
She went for the ex-boyfriend.

37:11.435 --> 37:12.716
Lucky she's young.

37:12.716 --> 37:16.515
Work your way through
my back catalogue, we'll be
here till the sun explodes.

37:16.515 --> 37:20.716
Where next? And how long before
that thing destroys her body?

37:20.716 --> 37:24.716
So what's our next move.
Stop the entire city of Cardiff
from shagging?

37:24.716 --> 37:28.795
Put bromide in the water supply.
No, too hit and miss.

37:28.795 --> 37:31.555
The water company got pissed off
last time we did that.

37:31.555 --> 37:35.476
It could have used any body
in Cardiff. Why her?
I just assumed it was random.

37:35.476 --> 37:39.635
It's mining Carys' life to get
what it needs. What else
do we know about her?

37:39.635 --> 37:43.316
Anything you can think of?
What are you all looking at me for?

37:43.316 --> 37:47.596
You did all the profiling!
I don't know. Sorry.

37:47.596 --> 37:48.716
She's great under pressure.

37:48.716 --> 37:51.715
There's gotta be something.
What did you say Carys' job was?

37:51.715 --> 37:54.035
She's just a temp. Receptionist.

37:54.035 --> 37:57.995
Where's she working at the moment?
I can pull her employment files up.

37:59.075 --> 38:02.516
Conway Clinic. You're joking.
What's the problem?

38:02.516 --> 38:05.516
It's a bloody fertility clinic.
Sperm donors.

38:05.516 --> 38:10.276
An unlimited supply of orgasmic
energy without all the build-up.
Perfect hit.

38:21.635 --> 38:24.436
Ah!
Carys. You're not on today, are you?

38:27.195 --> 38:31.436
It needs more.
The energy - it's not lasting.

38:31.436 --> 38:33.395
Sorry?

38:37.315 --> 38:40.235
'Mr Tunstall,
room number one's ready now.'

38:46.955 --> 38:49.596
MAN SCREAMS

38:53.955 --> 38:58.796
What's this for? Need a diagram?
I've never used a gun.

38:58.796 --> 39:00.596
You were in the police!

39:00.596 --> 39:03.596
I was on the beat! I'll
make sure you don't need to use it.

39:04.595 --> 39:08.555
I'm asking for you to get out!
Relax, I can help.
I don't think so, love, I'm gay.

39:09.635 --> 39:11.675
What do we do if we find her?

39:11.675 --> 39:14.716
How are we going to get it out of
her? Judging by the test results,

39:14.716 --> 39:18.755
the gas needed a host because
prolonged exposure to our
atmosphere is poisonous to it.

39:18.755 --> 39:20.915
But our bodies are
the perfect environment.

39:20.915 --> 39:22.915
If we isolate it
from Carys' body...

39:22.915 --> 39:25.835
It won't survive for long.
Sounds like we have a plan.

39:25.835 --> 39:26.956
Force it to die.

39:26.956 --> 39:28.795
Just like it did those poor blokes.

39:28.795 --> 39:31.435
What about Carys?
Better start praying

39:31.435 --> 39:34.075
we get to her in time.

39:40.276 --> 39:42.196
Come on!

39:46.755 --> 39:50.195
Out! Now!
Get as far away as you can!

40:02.236 --> 40:04.675
God, how many more?

40:12.195 --> 40:13.755
In here!

40:18.755 --> 40:21.116
Nowhere to run.

40:24.276 --> 40:29.236
All this sex.
All we see, all we think.

40:29.236 --> 40:33.356
So much beauty...and so much fear.

40:33.356 --> 40:36.475
We want it but we're
so afraid of it... Ah!

40:36.475 --> 40:39.875
The strain on her body's too much.

40:39.875 --> 40:44.195
Any second now, she's rat jam.
One more and I'll be strong.

40:44.195 --> 40:46.115
Each time, it works less.

40:46.115 --> 40:48.596
Each time, the feeling's weaker.

40:49.835 --> 40:53.155
One more. Make me feel alive.

40:53.155 --> 40:55.996
Make me feel human.

40:55.996 --> 40:58.516
I can't.

40:58.516 --> 40:59.956
I can.

40:59.956 --> 41:02.716
Jack! I've got a surplus of alive.

41:02.716 --> 41:04.036
I'm giving it away.

41:04.036 --> 41:06.715
You really want to feel something?

41:10.876 --> 41:12.956
What's he doing?

41:21.635 --> 41:26.836
That was just the kiss. Imagine
the buzz you get from the rest.

41:28.835 --> 41:33.595
Wasn't exactly the reaction
I anticipated. Her body
won't last much longer.

41:33.595 --> 41:35.555
Use me.

41:35.555 --> 41:40.196
Leave Carys. Take my body as host.
Just let her live.

41:41.915 --> 41:45.115
Gwen... I'm stronger than she is.

41:45.115 --> 41:48.796
I'll last longer. You might be
able to save me, I don't know.

41:48.796 --> 41:51.956
OK. Jack!

41:51.956 --> 41:57.595
You can't let her! Like she
said...she's responsible for this.

42:06.476 --> 42:10.755
Come on, then. Do it. Leave her.

42:54.515 --> 42:56.356
How long can it survive in there?

42:56.356 --> 42:58.316
It was pretty weak. Why?

42:58.316 --> 43:01.596
Bit worried how long that
battery'll last for.

43:03.796 --> 43:08.956
Look... It's dying.

43:28.276 --> 43:32.515
You travel halfway across the
universe for the greatest sex.

43:32.515 --> 43:35.276
You still end up dying alone.

43:40.515 --> 43:41.795
Thank you.

44:36.676 --> 44:38.755
Still here?

44:38.755 --> 44:43.556
Everybody else is
off doing...whatever it is
they do when they're not here.

44:43.556 --> 44:45.396
How long have you been there?

44:50.276 --> 44:52.436
I wanted to finish off.

44:52.436 --> 44:55.115
Do one thing for me.

44:55.115 --> 45:01.355
Don't let the job consume you.
You have a life. Perspective.
We need that.

45:01.355 --> 45:04.315
Who are you, Jack?

45:04.315 --> 45:09.515
I'm sorry? You can't die.
You tell me the 21st century
is when it all changes,

45:09.515 --> 45:11.356
that we have to be prepared.
You do.

45:11.356 --> 45:15.675
But how can you know?
You think knowing the answers
would make you feel better?

45:15.675 --> 45:20.195
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

45:21.595 --> 45:25.155
Go home, Gwen Cooper. Eat lasagne.

45:25.155 --> 45:26.716
Kiss your boyfriend.

45:26.716 --> 45:29.036
Be normal.

45:29.036 --> 45:31.356
For me.

45:33.316 --> 45:36.155
So I said, those bloody website...

45:39.155 --> 45:41.716
I've had years of experience.

45:41.716 --> 45:45.276
I know the journeys, I've driven
most of them, I know the best way.

45:48.035 --> 45:49.236
Am I boring you?

45:53.236 --> 45:54.876
Sorry.

45:54.876 --> 45:58.435
Too grand to care
about transport routes now, are we?

46:08.075 --> 46:09.556
Let's go to bed.

46:26.675 --> 46:30.155
You saw the echo of a moment
amplified by alien technology.

46:30.155 --> 46:33.676
A ghost. ..40, 45 years ago.

46:33.676 --> 46:36.475
I saw it happen. Ah!
You need to know how to use these.

46:37.635 --> 46:38.795
Wait!

46:43.715 --> 46:46.115
I've see things
you wouldn't believe.

46:50.716 --> 46:52.036
No!

46:52.476 --> 46:54.275
Get out! Help me!
