00:05.339 --> 00:09.141
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:19.284
Mike:
<i>I'd like to begin by saying</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:21.420
there is only one thing
on anybody's mind today...

00:21.422 --> 00:23.722
The president's hosting
of her first state visit.

00:23.724 --> 00:28.093
After welcoming the Israeli Prime
Minister to the White House...

00:28.095 --> 00:29.294
Did he dye his mustache?

00:29.296 --> 00:30.562
To ensure that
they seize this...

00:30.564 --> 00:32.296
Holy shit, he dyed his mustache.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.634
It's vanity. He's the TV
face of the administration.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.771
<i>But he's glued Cheetos
to that face.</i>

00:38.773 --> 00:40.773
He looks like Yosemite Sam.

00:40.775 --> 00:42.574
Yeah, without the credibility.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.477
He's gonna get
his tits done next.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.180
- Sean? - Today's the
president's 33rd day in office.

00:48.182 --> 00:52.217
She's outlasted William Henry Harrison,
our shortest serving president.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.153
- How's she feel about that?
- She feels great,

00:54.155 --> 00:57.089
unlike President Harrison
who contracted pneumonia

00:57.091 --> 00:58.457
during his inaugural
address and died.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.427
- ( reporters laugh )
- Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.195
Nice work, Mike.
You're on fire.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.564
- Nope, wait. It's your mustache.
- ( chuckles )

01:05.566 --> 01:06.832
I call it Tangerine Dream.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.534
Hey, are we getting
cocktails later?

01:08.536 --> 01:11.603
No, I can't.
I've got to get home.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.805
( laughing )
You...

01:12.807 --> 01:16.542
- Can you imagine?
- No. We love to drink.

01:16.544 --> 01:20.279
So our concern is debate
time for Families First.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.781
Our friends on the rules
committee need a shove.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.783
So you want me to rule
the House rules committee.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.652
Yeah, if anyone can do
this, Dan, I'm confident

01:26.654 --> 01:28.654
you or the guy we hired
to replace you can.

01:28.656 --> 01:32.591
Gary: I am really excited
about this Israeli visit.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.259
Gonna be a good day, guys.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.261
Middle East, middle easy.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.230
I'm a little concerned
about the dinner centerpieces,

01:38.232 --> 01:39.731
- 'cause I feel like they...
- Whatever.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.101
I'm handling world peace, okay?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.435
You just go make
the room pretty,

01:43.437 --> 01:46.472
i.e., the opposite of
that fucking monstrosity.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.140
<i>What is that?
Picasso's heavy period?</i>

01:48.142 --> 01:50.709
- President Hughes loved it. - Is that
why his wife tried to kill herself?

01:50.711 --> 01:54.880
- ( Selina laughs ) - Ben: I think it's
called "A Man Who Shits Triangles."

01:54.882 --> 01:56.849
Bad enough having
the Pentagon up your ass.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.550
Where is Amy, by the way?

01:58.552 --> 02:01.186
She's campaign manager,
this is a campaign meeting.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.322
I mean, I've got to go
save the world.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.224
I know that sounds
like hyperbole, but...

02:05.226 --> 02:06.825
- But you do. Yeah.
- I do, in fact.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.759
I actually do do
have to do that.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.362
I just got a text from Amy.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.597
"I'm a latte"?

02:11.599 --> 02:14.833
- Huh?
- Guess she means she's late.

02:14.835 --> 02:15.868
( horns honking )

02:15.870 --> 02:18.337
Amy: <i>You said there
wouldn't be traffic.</i>

02:18.339 --> 02:20.405
- This is traffic.
- Yep.

02:20.407 --> 02:24.476
Could be anything... accident
up ahead, active shooter.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.410
Well, probably not that.

02:25.412 --> 02:29.781
You make me any more late, and I lock
you in this car and have it compacted.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.284
- How about some music? Hmm?
- No.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.585
I Bluetoothed your phone, so...

02:33.587 --> 02:35.854
Amy's voice: <i>Memo to
self... it is winnable.</i>

02:35.856 --> 02:38.757
- <i>Delete the private polling.</i>
- Oh, turn that off.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.225
I thought I had it on shuffle.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.393
Amy's voice:
<i>Also, hair.</i>

02:41.395 --> 02:44.296
<i>Ask Marianne about electrolysis.</i>

02:44.298 --> 02:47.299
The campaign,
the whole comm strategy.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.435
We've got too many balls
being dropped right now.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.804
For instance,
we've got yet another

02:52.806 --> 02:56.608
- appalling photograph of Catherine.
- ( Ben laughs )

02:56.610 --> 02:58.744
No offense, honey, but, I
mean, look at yourself.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.680
It's not my fault. The press
doesn't take me seriously

03:01.682 --> 03:03.916
because I don't
have a role here.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.517
I need a core role.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.553
Yeah, that's a very good idea.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.921
She has good
organizational skills.

03:08.923 --> 03:12.858
- She turned around the college film
society. - I transformed it, Mom.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.493
- She... she... good for you.
- <i>( knocking )</i>

03:14.495 --> 03:17.229
Ma'am, I've got a virtual Amy.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.664
Ma'am, I am so sorry.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.699
Oh, can't she just call in?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.568
I feel like I'm on trial
in the future.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.871
( breaking up ) Ma'am, if I could
interrupt. I really think that...

03:25.873 --> 03:29.408
Uh, Amy, it's filtering out
like every other word.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.742
Usually I just do that myself.

03:30.744 --> 03:35.614
Okay, this is why we need a
steady hand like Bill Ericsson.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.583
By the way, I'm bringing
in Bill Ericsson.

03:37.585 --> 03:41.253
Madam President, did you
just say Bill Ericsson?

03:41.255 --> 03:43.488
Ma'am, I...
Ooh!

03:43.490 --> 03:45.891
Selina: <i>Oh, okay, I can't
look at that anymore.</i>

03:45.893 --> 03:47.626
It's bad enough looking
at Mike's mustache.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.262
Have you seen that thing?
It's like he ate a volcano.

03:50.264 --> 03:53.332
Ma'am, we do have that issue
of national security,

03:53.334 --> 03:54.733
so I'm afraid that
Catherine right now...

03:54.735 --> 03:56.868
Oh, okay. Catherine, you
have to get out, honey.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.005
<i>- Go.</i>
- Kent: <i> Sorry, I apologize.</i>

04:00.941 --> 04:02.808
Madam President,
I'd like to state

04:02.810 --> 04:05.978
that I think that Catherine
is a valuable asset.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.279
- Yeah.
- And daughter.

04:07.281 --> 04:11.516
But her likability index is...

04:11.518 --> 04:13.585
shallow.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.419
What?

04:14.421 --> 04:17.289
We polled her popularity.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.423
How dare you?

04:19.426 --> 04:24.529
How could you have
the audacity to...

04:24.531 --> 04:25.897
Oh.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.666
Oh, these are not good.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.936
Okay, well, she's gonna
have to be told.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.004
Gently, of course.

04:32.006 --> 04:35.440
But who's going to do that?

04:38.012 --> 04:41.380
- I believe I have the skills, ma'am.
- There you go.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.981
Fine.
You do it, Kent.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.483
- <i>( knocks )</i>
- Okay... what?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.818
Ma'am, today is
a very special day.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.821
I know. I'm building
a road map to peace.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.957
Not just that, ma'am.
Not just that.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.558
Don't tell me
it's Happy Harrison Day.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.397
I outlived some dead
idiot president. Wow.

04:59.033 --> 04:59.965
No.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.767
- <i>What?</i>
- It's Ben's birthday.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.336
- Selina: <i> Oh!</i>
- My birthday.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.337
Happy birthday, Ben.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.972
- Wow, that was quick.
- Ben: <i> Yeah.</i>

05:06.974 --> 05:11.476
- We have a cake?
- No.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.311
No?

05:12.313 --> 05:15.480
All right, well, that was
a good interruption.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.883
<i>Thanks.
( scoffs )</i>

05:19.853 --> 05:21.620
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.322
Ah, William Henry Harrison.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.790
Oh, God, at least somebody...

05:24.792 --> 05:27.059
Noticed this horrible cake?

05:27.061 --> 05:28.427
You're welcome.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.330
- Just go ahead.
- ( knocking )

05:33.500 --> 05:34.900
Hey, Jonah.

05:34.902 --> 05:35.967
Hello. Hi.
Hello, sir.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.705
Better think of a way
to make me feel good.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.839
Okay, of course.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.408
I could go get you
some Pringles or...

05:43.410 --> 05:44.710
Teddy done you a solid.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.878
On my advice, the veep's
gonna ask you to be

05:46.880 --> 05:50.849
in the Families First
talks with Dan Egan.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.751
Oh, that's fantastic news, sir.

05:52.753 --> 05:56.922
You simultaneously
made my day and ruined his.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.557
Thank you.
Shine brightly.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.992
Tap-tap-tap-tap-
tap-tap.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.027
All good?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.963
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Doyle: <i> Yeah?</i>

06:09.703 --> 06:12.404
Gary: See, we need bigger centerpieces
for the state dinner tonight.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.740
I don't care about the cost.
You got to get on that.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.041
Listen, please, please, please.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.642
If anybody doesn't
know the difference

06:17.644 --> 06:19.611
between a valance and a jabot,
I really need you to leave.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.013
- Did the president's stylist get my notes?
- Yes, he did.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.415
Okay, thank God.
Oh, my God.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.950
Did we get these from a
homeless man's grave?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.852
They're molesting my eyes.
What's happening right now?

06:26.854 --> 06:29.454
- There's my favorite guy.
- ( gasps ) Patty!

06:29.456 --> 06:31.456
My favorite White House
social secretary!

06:31.458 --> 06:33.425
( chuckles ) Did you hear
about the centerpieces?

06:33.427 --> 06:36.628
I did. I heard you sent them
back to centerpiece hell.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.929
I know. We felt
they weren't right.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.565
So this is coming
from the president?

06:40.567 --> 06:41.666
It's coming from us.

06:41.668 --> 06:44.636
And the painting, she wants
that swapped out, too?

06:44.638 --> 06:45.504
Yes, we do.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.640
And when you say that the
centerpieces are not right,

06:48.642 --> 06:51.543
can you just give me
a little indication

06:51.545 --> 06:54.413
of what you mean
when you say "not right"?

06:54.415 --> 06:56.681
We just kind of feel like they
need to be a different shape.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.116
- They need to pop.
- Okay.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.018
- Okay, they need to pop?
- Pop.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.019
- No, I heard you.
- Okay.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.789
- Okay. - It is so good to
find someone who gets us.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.123
- Mm.
- It really is.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.058
Sue, I need to see
the president right away.

07:07.060 --> 07:11.630
Sure, Amy, I'll just tell the Israelis
to move on, 'cause they love that.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.932
All right, Richard, you
need to hide Ben's Ativan

07:13.934 --> 07:15.467
till he comes clean
about Bill Ericsson.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.870
- Hi, Amy.
- Bill, it... it's good to see you.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.174
- I hear you're working... - Working
at the White House. Yes, I am.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.042
- In what capacity?
- What capacity?

07:24.044 --> 07:27.045
I have a specific title,
but a wide brief...

07:27.047 --> 07:28.447
Eliminate weaknesses.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.649
That's a little Nazi doctor.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.117
I'm the new director
of communications.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.052
Oh, that's cool,
'cause some of us thought

07:34.054 --> 07:35.620
you were the new
campaign manager.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.022
- Mmm! - Oh, no. I get it. Okay.

07:37.024 --> 07:41.827
Well, I just wanted to say a
friendly hello in an unfriendly way.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.029
Hello.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.801
Okay, I'm gonna try
to say it right.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.735
Shalom aleichem.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.804
- Aleichem. Very good.
- And welcome to America.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.973
Israeli P.M.: <i>Thank you very
much for your hospitality.</i>

07:54.975 --> 07:56.942
All right, I don't
mean to be abrupt,

07:56.944 --> 07:58.677
but this is over.
Thank you.

07:58.679 --> 08:02.047
So I think we have a five-minute
break and then we can resume, yes?

08:02.049 --> 08:05.183
- Okay, very well.
- Okay, wonderful. Thank you.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.919
I like him.
And I loathe politicians.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.756
Madam President, a painting in the
White House was removed this morning.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.958
Should we go
to the Situation Room?

08:12.960 --> 08:17.162
It was the only work of art by a Native
American artist in the building.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.663
I mean, who knew
we even had one?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.599
It was the crazy
triangles painting.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.834
Native Americans are taking it
as a slight, ma'am.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.638
Then just issue a statement saying
we had it sent out to be cleaned.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.206
Actually, have
Bill Ericsson do that

08:28.208 --> 08:30.809
because I'm having
Bill Ericsson replace you.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.110
- Lee: <i> Madam President?</i>
- Yeah?

08:32.111 --> 08:33.912
Points of departure
for the possible agreements

08:33.914 --> 08:37.282
on the scale-down
of blockades.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.083
Who is that?

08:39.086 --> 08:41.553
To be honest, I don't even
know if she's one of ours.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.656
20 bucks says she's Mossad. Come
on, we've only got four minutes.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.157
Okay. Sorry, Jim.
I don't have time

08:46.159 --> 08:47.726
<i>to explain my thinking on that.</i>

08:47.728 --> 08:50.529
It's just I've got
the Middle East in here.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.599
Even though we have
our differences,

08:54.601 --> 08:57.068
I think my mom brokering
major peace talks

08:57.070 --> 08:59.137
is super awesome.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.238
It is.
Super awesome.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.909
But I want to talk to you
about a more personal matter.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.110
I didn't take drugs
with those guys.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.812
I was just in their bus
for half an hour.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.884
That is good to know.

09:12.886 --> 09:18.823
This is about the brand image
of Catherine Meyer, TM.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.595
I asked you in because, um...

09:24.698 --> 09:27.032
Catherine, America
doesn't like you.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.066
What?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.301
That sounded way too harsh

09:29.303 --> 09:30.969
when boiled down
to a headline thought.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.905
- Let me see that.
- It's not that you are unlikable.

09:33.907 --> 09:39.210
It's that there's a perception
that you are unlikable.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.312
They hate me.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.814
I wouldn't say hate.
You just...

09:42.816 --> 09:48.620
polarize opinion with the bulk of
it gravitating to this pole here.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.924
Uh... oh, my.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.993
You have sharp shoulders.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.728
This is like high school
all over again.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.863
Yeah, sure, kind of,
but much bigger.

09:58.865 --> 10:02.067
<i>So let's talk about
changing your narrative.</i>

10:02.069 --> 10:04.636
Customary shortcuts
to public affirmation

10:04.638 --> 10:06.271
are military service
or childbirth.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.108
Okay, God, no, and, oh, my
God, no, in that order.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.877
Okay, well, then we go
back to the idea

10:12.879 --> 10:15.714
of turning that frown

10:15.716 --> 10:18.316
into the inverse of a frown.

10:19.219 --> 10:23.288
- Upside down?
- If you will.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.892
So there wasn't even
like a little part of you

10:27.894 --> 10:29.260
that thought I was gonna
be in these talks?

10:29.262 --> 10:33.965
Okay, look, just sit there in the
meeting and let me take the lead.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.701
If I need your help,
I'll give you a signal.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.037
Okay, what's the signal?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.405
There's not gonna be
a signal, Jonah.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.641
- Hey.
- Congressman Pierce, so good to see you.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.011
Hey, what's shakin', bacon? That's my
way of saying hello, breaking the ice.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.213
- God, it's good to see you.
- This is my colleague.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.749
- But you know what? Let's get started.
- Yeah.

10:50.751 --> 10:54.219
I really like your office.
This is a great office.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.687
The way you've arranged
the furniture.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.155
This horse guy over here,
that painting.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.424
This is the nicest office
I've ever been in.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.892
My friend here
is very excited here,

11:00.894 --> 11:03.862
as are we, obviously,
about the Families First bill.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.897
Specifically,
the pre-K program

11:05.899 --> 11:08.066
for low-income families.
We're very proud of that.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.868
Well, the people
that I represent

11:09.870 --> 11:13.271
like to see that money
is spent wisely.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.141
Of course, that's why we always
say invest in education.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.709
You know, don't think
of them as kids

11:17.711 --> 11:19.978
as much as little
human start-ups.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.079
You know, spend to save.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.849
And then you take the money
you save and you spend it.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.918
That's economics.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.920
And, well, on my desk here,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.056
you see I keep a box of coupons.

11:31.058 --> 11:31.890
I clip them myself.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.926
And this is to help me
to remember to be economical.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.261
That is a fantastic idea.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.296
I'm gonna take a page.
I'm gonna do this myself.

11:38.298 --> 11:42.333
Did you know that a lot
of these have expired?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.370
Yeah, I'm so...
It's so busy on the...

11:45.372 --> 11:47.439
- I'm on the rules committee now.
- Of course.

11:47.441 --> 11:50.275
So what you're saying is that you
support the bill in principle,

11:50.277 --> 11:52.010
but you're worried
that an escalation of cost

11:52.012 --> 11:53.978
wouldn't sit well with your
colleagues in the House?

11:53.980 --> 11:56.214
Mmm, that's... yeah,
that's very well put.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.950
- Thank you.
- Hey, you like to bowl?

11:58.952 --> 12:01.753
Oh, I am a terrible bowler.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.089
But I enjoy the social
aspects immensely.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.958
Well, you know, we're all getting
together for a little hang

12:06.960 --> 12:08.927
at the White House
bowling alley tomorrow night.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.161
- Oh.
- Throwing strikes

12:10.163 --> 12:11.796
with the President
of the United States.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.765
- That's bucket list bowling.
- I didn't mean that she would...

12:13.767 --> 12:15.500
A one-on-one with the
president would be great.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.269
- And a photographic record of it...
- You want to get a photo?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.905
- We'd have to check with the scheduler.
- No, we got this.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.307
She's probably not
a very good bowler.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.843
- You might even be able to beat her.
- ( Pierce laughs )

12:24.845 --> 12:26.377
Mike: <i>We do have
Native American staff.</i>

12:26.379 --> 12:29.180
They're on a list that you're gonna
give me in 30 minutes, okay?

12:29.182 --> 12:33.284
Now get me some scalps.
Names. Get me some names.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.023
Hey, buddy, I don't
know what to say.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.025
This job's my whole life.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.828
Hey, I hate to ask, but would
you mind helping me out?

12:43.830 --> 12:47.932
Would you tell the media that
Bill Ericsson's taking your job?

12:47.934 --> 12:50.368
It would just make it
seem more amicable.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.470
Would you do that for me?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.846
No.

13:01.848 --> 13:05.416
And if we could just agree to
a timetable for the talks.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.953
Can you imagine that? I mean,
it would be the first brick

13:08.955 --> 13:11.523
- in the wall of peace.
- It's not a wall, ma'am.

13:11.525 --> 13:14.559
Well, it's an expression.
A bridge of peace, I'll say.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.161
We're so close.
We're so close.

13:16.163 --> 13:19.531
So is my country to lots of people
who would like to destroy it.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.165
Uh...

13:20.167 --> 13:23.568
Are all these notes about
the Native American painting?

13:23.570 --> 13:27.505
Yes, it's ironic that you're
talking to us about occupation

13:27.507 --> 13:31.009
while you occupy
someone else's continent.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.945
Yeah, okay. Well, I do
see the irony in that.

13:33.947 --> 13:38.283
( laughs ) Excuse me just two seconds.
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.318
- Hi.
- It's about the painting.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.488
Okay, you see what's going
on over here behind me?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.423
- Kind of a big deal.
- Yeah.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.026
So why don't you tell
Sacheen Littlefeather

13:48.028 --> 13:51.229
to get off the rag and
get over it, all right?

13:51.231 --> 13:53.031
- Okay.
- And I never said that.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.333
- Right.
- Right. Okay.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.003
To reiterate,
the painting was not removed.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.939
It was just taken out
to be cleaned.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.908
It was painted four years ago.
What made it so dirty?

14:03.910 --> 14:06.945
This was just
a preemptive cleaning,

14:06.947 --> 14:08.246
much like a juice cleanse.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.282
But the Native American painting is
the only one getting the cleanse?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.218
Mike: <i>Other paintings
will also be cleansed.</i>

14:13.220 --> 14:16.187
Cleansed is not the right word.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.623
Wiped.
No, not wiped.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.491
Cleaned.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.395
Moving on to the state
dinner this evening.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.297
- Sue. Sue, Sue, Sue.
- Yeah?

14:26.299 --> 14:27.866
- I need your help.
- What is it?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.901
Sue, I need a window
for the... whoa.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.170
Gary, you look whiter than
a Georgia country club.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.972
- What?
- Sue: <i> What the hell is wrong, Gary?</i>

14:33.974 --> 14:36.608
I mean currently. We don't have
time for the whole tapestry.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.244
I moved the painting.
I did it.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.312
- <i>You have to tell her.</i>
- No, no, no, it's worse than that.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.315
- I did something really bad.
- Is there a child missing?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.651
I wanted her first state
dinner to be really nice.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.652
So you what?
Hired strippers?

14:47.654 --> 14:50.922
No, I spent some money.
Like, I spent a lot of money.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.423
Oh, you really need to tell her.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.293
Sue, you know... you know
it's not as easy as that.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.395
Gary, your inner child
needs to grow an outer man.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.931
Okay, I was just trying
to make her happy.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.399
Mission incomplete, dude.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.467
I feel so much better.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.904
- Thank you so much. Heart-to-heart.
- Great. Great.

15:05.906 --> 15:09.340
Boy, at peace with Israel,
at war with Native Americans.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.043
Do you know what I am? I'm like
the opposite of Mel Gibson.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.246
- Well, ma'am, the Saudis are getting
anxious. - Oh, you got to stall them.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.981
- Madam President, I thought...
- Yeah, Bill...

15:16.983 --> 15:18.549
Ma'am, the US Poultry
Association is concerned

15:18.551 --> 15:20.551
that there are no current
photos of you eating eggs.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.454
- That's terrific. - Hey, ma'am, can
I just have a moment of your time?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.256
No, I can't give you
any little moment.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.058
Madam President,
I have the GDP figures.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.594
Uh, give them to Kent.
Kent, what do you need?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.229
I was gonna ask
for the GDP figures.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.498
- Then that's perfect.
- All I need is just one little second.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.000
Gary, I am going to think
about the dinner

15:36.002 --> 15:38.369
when I'm actually putting
the dinner in my mouth.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.673
Now what we need
is a lot more butt-ugly

15:41.675 --> 15:43.541
Native American paintings, okay?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.476
Because the first
butt-ugly one was removed

15:45.478 --> 15:48.413
by some jerkoff with a
hair ball for a brain.

15:48.415 --> 15:52.383
- Yeah.
- Now, I have got to go to the toilet.

15:52.385 --> 15:56.487
So I hope that can answer
anybody else's questions.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.691
I gotta... wow.

15:59.693 --> 16:03.528
Dan: And what we're proposing, Congresswoman,
with the Families First bill...

16:03.530 --> 16:04.629
No, I got this.
I got this.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.700
What we're proposing is a minimum
12-month eligibility period

16:08.702 --> 16:10.268
and a safety check
on all providers.

16:10.270 --> 16:14.372
I hear you, but I wanted to ask a
technical question about the bill.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.341
Sure, yeah, absolutely.
Go ahead.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.508
Why do title 2, section 3

16:17.510 --> 16:21.012
and title 8, section 5
contradict each other?

16:21.648 --> 16:25.717
Uh, my colleague Mr. Egan, he's
more the nuts and bolts guy.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.518
- So I'll...
- No. No, no, you got this.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.455
- No, you can...
- We call him Dr. Details.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.225
Do you like Martin Scorsese?

16:34.227 --> 16:37.362
Because we have a private
screening of his new film

16:37.364 --> 16:39.197
at the White House coming up.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.132
Okay.
Will he be there?

16:41.134 --> 16:41.733
Yes.

16:41.735 --> 16:45.370
Oh, your assistant
has something for you.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.472
Excuse me.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.207
- What Scorsese film?
- I don't know.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.410
He's got to have a new one dropping, right?
He's really prolific.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.445
Jesus Christ.
You can't lie, Jonah.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.415
A: she's gonna find out
and B: you suck at it.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.717
Well, you have an entire
team briefing you, Dan.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.153
You got all your Danettes
and your Dangelinas.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.555
I'm flying solo.
I'm fucking Amelia Earhart

17:04.557 --> 17:06.656
and I'm still doing
a better job than you.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.425
- And you owe me a staff.
- Staff?

17:08.428 --> 17:09.660
Oh, well, I guess
you'll meet them all

17:09.662 --> 17:11.596
at the Scorsese screening
you're having in your head.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.364
Oh, well, I guess I'll
just start telling people

17:13.366 --> 17:15.767
that you're the one that planted
the Danny Chung torture rumors.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.502
- You shut the fuck up.
- Oh, me shut the fuck up?

17:17.503 --> 17:19.569
- ( arguing )
- Congresswoman: I am sorry.

17:19.571 --> 17:22.173
There's a lot of Navajo
in my district.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.175
This painting thing
is escalating.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.576
I'm afraid I'll have
to postpone.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.112
We completely understand.
We'll be in touch.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.681
About that screening
with Marty...

17:30.683 --> 17:32.617
you ever see
"The King of Comedy"?

17:32.619 --> 17:36.788
- I haven't.
- It's a good one. Underrated.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.723
<i>( blow-dryer humming )</i>

17:38.725 --> 17:41.125
Hey, so let me see
the photo face

17:41.127 --> 17:44.328
that you and Kent
were working on.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.633
That's not good.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.201
You're flaring your nostrils.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.371
- It feels natural.
- <i>I'll tell you what. You watch me.</i>

17:53.373 --> 17:55.606
See if you can mimic this, okay?

17:55.608 --> 17:58.643
Like... more like this.
Like...

18:01.448 --> 18:03.748
You see that?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.751
That's right, honey.
No, no, that was good.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.121
That looked happy,
even if you're not happy.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.789
That's the trick.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.625
You got to make sure
she has height here.

18:14.627 --> 18:18.529
A lot of volume
because her skull is low.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.797
It's kind of indented.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.866
Barbra Streisand pulled out
of the state dinner.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.835
Do you have Sarah Silverman's
contact information?

18:23.837 --> 18:27.205
- For the dinner? No. - I think if
there are three whole flower trucks

18:27.207 --> 18:29.407
parked outside the White
House, I would know about it.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.143
( whispering ) Go. Outside, go.
Count the flower trucks.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.544
Did you find me an office?

18:33.546 --> 18:34.846
No, but I scouted you
this chair.

18:34.848 --> 18:37.215
And if you stand on it just
like so, you can get Wi-Fi.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.718
- You would not believe the day that
I'm having. - Jonah: <i> Oh, what a day.</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:43.154
I feel like this is gonna be
a key scene in my biopic.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.223
Hey, I need a shirt.
This isn't "Die Hard."

18:45.225 --> 18:48.126
Hey, sugar tits, did you stroke
and choke the rules committee?

18:48.128 --> 18:50.695
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Egan
dropped the ball a little bit,

18:50.697 --> 18:52.497
but I picked it up.
He's a good kid.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.432
How's it going with Mr.
Genius Bar over there?

18:54.434 --> 18:57.635
He's eager and hardworking
and never complains

18:57.637 --> 18:59.637
and every night
I dream of drowning him.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.173
- How would you like to get rid of him?
- God, yes.

19:02.175 --> 19:06.644
Jonah, I am so proud of you, I could
squeeze you like a sponge in the shower.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.180
Yo, yeah.
Yep, I'll come with you.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.149
You have seven missed messages.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.351
Should I read 'em to you?
I'll read 'em to you. Oh.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.654
Uh, Jonah, look, Amy was telling
me all about Richard here.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.557
Richard apparently is the
assistant's assistant.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.360
Does that mean, like, he's
the epitome of an assistant

19:22.362 --> 19:25.463
- or he's just an assistant's assistant?
- The first one.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.633
Richard, how would you
like to work right here

19:28.635 --> 19:31.469
in the White House
for the Jonah Ryan?

19:31.471 --> 19:33.671
- Work in the White House?
- Yeah.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.407
Am I being "Punk'd"?
Is this hazing?

19:36.409 --> 19:38.943
Happened to my brother once.
He did not handle it well.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.444
All right, well,
Jonah, there you go.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.546
You now have someone under you.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.848
Great, or at least
between me and Teddy.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.683
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.418
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.954
Oh, "sir." I like that.
I'll get used to that.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.355
- Keep doing it.
- Yes, sir.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.559
There it is again. That's twice.
Come with me.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.294
Thank you.
I owe you one.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.330
Of course you do. Why else
would I have done it?

19:59.332 --> 20:02.500
Bill: <i>What's Gary doing?
Trying to max out America?</i>

20:02.502 --> 20:04.702
Wow, who knew they made
lampshades out of unobtanium?

20:04.704 --> 20:08.739
Okay, guys, I will not hear a single
bad word about my friend Gary.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.709
But, no. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, he's out of control.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.411
Did you see the cost
of the dinner?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.413
This'll sting us, make us
look decadent and remote.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.249
Yeah, said the Princeton grad
in the Valentino tux.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.617
Sue: <i>Does the president
need to know?</i>

20:19.619 --> 20:21.452
She's got a lot on her plate
right now, no pun intended.

20:21.454 --> 20:25.423
That her bagman spends like a
Babylonian king? Yes, I think so.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.791
You can tell her.
She likes you.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.660
And I plan on keeping it that
way, so I'll leave it to you.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.929
Sue, would you like
to tell the president?

20:31.931 --> 20:36.434
No, I would not, but thank
you for thinking of me.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.737
You have a pretty good relationship
with the president, don't you?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.673
- You guys talk.
- Beep, boop, beboop. Hello?

20:42.675 --> 20:43.774
Yeah, hi.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.811
You are in the J-Corps now
and we own these hallways.

20:46.813 --> 20:50.548
- Hey, Preppy Longstocking.
- Yeah, your fat mama.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.716
- ( chuckles )
- See that?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.718
It's kind of how we do
things here in "the Wing."

20:53.720 --> 20:57.255
Now through this door
is the Oval Office.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.657
- Fudge me. No.
- Yeah.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.593
You are like the coolest
guy I've ever met.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.028
The president and I,
we're like this.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.764
- You know, not to scale, obviously.
- Of course.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.698
( applause )

21:07.700 --> 21:11.702
<i>( "Hail to the Chief" playing )</i>

21:15.908 --> 21:18.909
Selina:
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:21.047 --> 21:23.047
Ah, this is truly spectacular.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.315
Thank you.
I think so.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.517
God, I hope you don't have
any allergies, though,

21:26.519 --> 21:30.888
'cause these centerpieces are
kind of imposing, aren't they?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.957
Better not leak any photos.
I see your media

21:32.959 --> 21:36.394
likes to make a big fuss
about how much you spend.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.862
Oh, yeah.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.464
Yes. Yes. Huh?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.733
What? What fuss?
What spending?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.736
Is it the state dinner?
What, is it Patty?

21:45.738 --> 21:48.572
- It's not Patty.
- What is it?

21:48.574 --> 21:50.308
- It's Gary.
- Gary?

21:50.310 --> 21:52.777
Yeah, he's been
on a spender bender.

21:52.779 --> 21:53.844
How much has he spent?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.846
Well, imagine Elton John
on a day he feels fat.

21:55.848 --> 21:59.984
Press just kept sniffing around
after the stink about the painting.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.653
Did we ever find out who moved
that painting, by the way?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.088
Um, that would be Gary, too.

22:04.090 --> 22:09.593
( scoffs ) So I have just
brokered a peace deal

22:09.595 --> 22:10.661
with Israel here.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.097
I, as President
of the United States,

22:13.099 --> 22:15.533
have actually
achieved something,

22:15.535 --> 22:17.635
- which is virtually unheard of.
- Yeah.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.671
And yet I'm sharing
headline news with a painting

22:20.673 --> 22:24.642
because of that guy right there?

22:24.644 --> 22:27.044
- Yep.
- Okay, got it.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.946
Thank you very much.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.984
Thank you.
Thank you.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.019
Thank you.

22:35.021 --> 22:39.023
Prime Minister Ben-Haim,

22:39.025 --> 22:41.525
Mrs. Ben-Haim,

22:41.527 --> 22:44.995
welcome to the White House.

22:46.466 --> 22:50.968
Hatred is a powerful emotion.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.572
But not the most powerful.

22:54.574 --> 23:00.378
Hope is more powerful than hate.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.480
Hope can build.

23:02.482 --> 23:07.818
But for hope to grow,
we first need trust,

23:07.820 --> 23:09.653
don't we?

23:11.124 --> 23:15.092
To paraphrase
a predecessor of mine,

23:15.094 --> 23:20.865
we have nothing to trust
but trust itself.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.737
Selina:
<i>Gary?</i>

23:26.739 --> 23:29.106
Gary!

23:34.714 --> 23:38.182
- Come out of there.
- Ma'am, if you'll just let me explain.

23:38.184 --> 23:42.720
Come out here now.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.859
Who do you think you
are, Gary Antoinette?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.428
Did somebody make you
first lady?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.496
'Cause I don't remember
marrying you, Gary.

23:52.498 --> 23:56.567
I don't remember fucking
you in Niagara Falls.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.735
I think I'd remember that.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.069
Ma'am, I'm really sorry
for the painting

23:59.071 --> 24:00.671
and I'm really sorry
for the spending,

24:00.673 --> 24:03.674
- but you have to understand...
- Oh, shut up.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.443
Just shut up.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.679
You are unimportant, okay?

24:08.681 --> 24:10.614
And you have suckered onto me

24:10.616 --> 24:13.984
like some sort of
a car window Garfield.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.152
That is not true, ma'am.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.455
You think you're some sort
of a big shot here?

24:17.457 --> 24:19.990
Oh, my God, you are not
a big shot, Gary.

24:19.992 --> 24:26.497
You're a middle-aged man
who sanitizes my tweezers.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.065
- ( chuckles ) God.
- You're wrong.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.735
- Excuse me?
- When's Catherine's birthday?

24:31.737 --> 24:32.736
- June eighth.
- Ninth.

24:32.738 --> 24:35.072
- Ninth.
- Which senator's daughter is in rehab?

24:35.074 --> 24:36.774
- You're out of line, missy.
- Geldray.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.809
- What are you wearing tomorrow?
- I don't know.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.177
I do.
I'm your calendar,

24:40.179 --> 24:43.147
I'm your Google, I'm your
Wilson the volleyball.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.215
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am!

24:44.217 --> 24:46.951
- No, you're not!
- I have broken my body for you.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.620
- Oh, come on.
- I have let myself be laughed at.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.788
I have let myself be humiliated.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.189
- But I'm happy to do it.
- Okay.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.592
Most of the time you don't
even know that I exist,

24:54.594 --> 24:55.960
but I am fucking
everything to you!

24:55.962 --> 24:58.963
Oh, I am so happy
to get somebody else

24:58.965 --> 25:00.498
to give me my hand cream.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.499
- Okay, go.
- Yeah.

25:01.501 --> 25:05.236
Can you find somebody else
who did what I did?

25:08.274 --> 25:11.208
- You mean on Labor Day?
- I didn't say that.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.810
Yeah, you did.
You just did.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.812
You j... you just
said Labor Day.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.581
I said I would never
mention that, ever.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.520
( sighs )
Oh, God.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.989
Okay, look, I'm, uh...

25:24.991 --> 25:27.024
I'm sorry if I lost
my temper a little bit.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.760
I am so sorry for the
words that I just spoke.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.295
You know, in...
In a relationship...

25:31.297 --> 25:33.898
It's just good to clear the
air is what I mean to say.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.634
- Yeah, I think any relationship...
- Yeah, should do that.

25:36.636 --> 25:41.238
- You know, from time to time.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.807
( sighs )

25:43.809 --> 25:44.942
That looks good.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.811
Yeah, it's...
It's light sponge.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.748
Would you like a piece?

25:50.750 --> 25:55.219
- Okay, I'll have a piece, I guess.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.859
- It's light sponge.
- You just told me that.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.028
Mm-hmm.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.566
Geldray's daughter is in rehab?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.200
Yes.
( sniffing )

26:10.202 --> 26:12.303
That explains all that energy.

26:12.305 --> 26:15.773
- Lot of energy.
- Right.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.311
Wow, this is a light sponge.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.614
- ( knocks )
- Hey, Mike.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.951
- Hey. That should be all of them.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

26:28.020 --> 26:30.688
Is there something
I can help you with?

26:30.690 --> 26:33.324
- Uh, no.
- <i>No?</i>

26:36.095 --> 26:40.130
I just find these paintings to
be inspirational. I really do.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.666
I particularly love
this color here.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.869
I think this is so
pretty, don't you?

26:45.871 --> 26:49.006
I believe the title
is "Massacre."

26:49.008 --> 26:51.208
And giving you your
Celebrating Community medals

26:51.210 --> 26:56.080
is the First Daughter of the
United States, Catherine Meyer.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.284
My, you are small.

27:00.286 --> 27:04.154
I suppose you're young,
but you're still very small.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.791
Honey, don't look so worried.
I'm not gonna bite you.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.694
But that man over there
does have a gun.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.730
That's a wonderful
photo of your daughter.

27:12.732 --> 27:16.300
Yeah, she looks so loveable
there, don't you think?

27:16.302 --> 27:18.002
Very... well,
she looks likable.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.738
Do you think she looks
likable in that picture?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.072
Have you ever seen "Star Wars"?

27:22.074 --> 27:25.242
This is a little bit
like the end of "Star Wars."

27:25.244 --> 27:29.880
The whole country
thanks you for your service.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.248
- Sue: <i> Ma'am.</i>
- Yeah?

27:31.250 --> 27:32.650
South Korea has called.

27:32.652 --> 27:35.986
They'd like to know
if you'd like a baby elephant.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.821
I have no response to that.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.658
Other than I already have one.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.925
<i>( laughs )
I'm kidding.</i>

27:41.927 --> 27:43.661
She used to be chubby
when she was little,

27:43.663 --> 27:47.197
but she's slimmed down
as she's gotten older.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.832
Thank goodness.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.736
Very good, very good.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.138
Thank you.

27:54.140 --> 27:58.242
Can you pull me out the second
it becomes acceptable to leave?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.010
Mm-hmm.
