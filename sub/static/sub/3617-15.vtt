00:00.250 --> 00:02.234
Ooh, I could eat him up.

00:02.334 --> 00:04.734
I swear I could,
with a little ranch dressing.

00:04.834 --> 00:06.234
Okay, but let's not, okay?

00:06.334 --> 00:08.899
I can't make that promise.

00:08.999 --> 00:12.275
Okay, don't listen to
your aunties, okay?
They're a little kooky.

00:12.375 --> 00:14.734
Us guys gotta stick together,
don't we, Peter?

00:14.834 --> 00:17.859
- Peter?
- Peter. I'm just floating it.

00:17.959 --> 00:20.734
Hmm. Is your name Peter?

00:20.834 --> 00:24.234
For what it's worth, I dated a
Peter in high school and he
wasn't very nice.

00:24.334 --> 00:26.234
Yeah, and you know,
for what it's worth,

00:26.334 --> 00:29.150
it's kind of the name
of the appendage that he has

00:29.250 --> 00:31.899
that surprised us all.
It might get him
teased in school.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.526
Okay, no Peter.
But we're running out of P's.

00:34.626 --> 00:37.109
I can't believe you never
thought of P boy names.

00:37.209 --> 00:39.692
Well, when I went
to the future,
I had a little girl.

00:39.792 --> 00:43.234
And obviously that has changed,
as has a lot of things.

00:43.334 --> 00:46.899
But I'm still having trouble
letting go of the name
we settled on.

00:46.999 --> 00:51.776
Prudence Melinda might get him
in trouble at school too.

00:51.876 --> 00:55.484
That's probably true,
although he could just
zap them under a roof,

00:55.584 --> 00:57.526
- like Harry Potter.
- God, I hope not.

00:57.626 --> 00:59.442
Aren't you excited to see
what his powers are?

00:59.542 --> 01:02.567
Excited, terrified...

01:02.667 --> 01:05.942
I mean, after seeing what the
kid could do inside the womb,

01:06.042 --> 01:07.899
he's no Muggle.

01:07.999 --> 01:09.899
Hey, what about Potter?

01:09.999 --> 01:12.359
Potter Halliwell,
or is it Wyatt?

01:12.459 --> 01:14.025
No, it's
definitely Halliwell.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.899
The demons fear it,
good magic respects it.

01:16.999 --> 01:18.899
I want what's
best for him.

01:18.999 --> 01:20.999
That's why I'm gonna
say no to Potter.

01:22.918 --> 01:25.734
Oh, somebody's getting
very sleepy.

01:25.834 --> 01:28.234
- [WHISPERING] Come on. Shh!
- We love you, we love you,

01:28.334 --> 01:30.776
baby, so much, love you,
love you, love you.

01:30.876 --> 01:32.792
- Bye, baby.
- PAIGE: Bye.

01:34.918 --> 01:37.609
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:37.709 --> 01:40.167
You're perfect.
You're a perfect
little creature.

01:44.751 --> 01:46.859
It's too bad with all
the powers your baby has,

01:46.959 --> 01:48.900
sleeping through the night
is not one of them.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.359
I'm sorry about that.
We can cast some sort of
soundproofing spell

01:52.459 --> 01:54.859
around our bedroom so you
won't have to deal with it.

01:54.959 --> 01:56.899
It'll interfere with the
baby's alarm system.

01:56.999 --> 01:58.192
Which works how exactly?

01:58.292 --> 02:00.025
Ah, pretty basic stuff.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.899
I just enchanted
a few cowry shells.

02:01.999 --> 02:03.983
That's not gonna
shock anything, is it?

02:04.083 --> 02:06.899
In the nursery?
I'm not a total idiot.

02:06.999 --> 02:10.567
It'll just alert us to the
presence of evil so we can all
sleep a little sounder.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.275
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:12.375 --> 02:14.192
I think I need to
apply some under-eye makeup

02:14.292 --> 02:17.584
to these dark circles
that your sweet baby caused.

02:20.209 --> 02:23.484
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna go watch him
sleep for a little while.

02:23.584 --> 02:24.983
Phoebe, you must go to work.

02:25.083 --> 02:28.192
Aren't you supposed
to meet the new owner
of the paper today?

02:28.292 --> 02:30.442
I know, but it's
just so hard to leave him.

02:30.542 --> 02:33.567
I mean, shouldn't there
be some sort of maternity
leave for new aunties?

02:33.667 --> 02:35.899
Phoebe, the club is not raking
in the dough these days,

02:35.999 --> 02:37.983
and Paige is unemployed,
the cost of diapers...

02:38.083 --> 02:40.899
We kind of need you
to keep your job.

02:40.999 --> 02:42.899
You're right, you're right.
I'm going.

02:42.999 --> 02:45.025
Just no Peter, okay.
And no Patrick.

02:45.125 --> 02:47.899
You should consider Potter
because it's a great name.

02:47.999 --> 02:52.192
Okay? Just don't make any
decisions until I get back,
please.

02:52.292 --> 02:54.859
- Time to go.
- And do me a favor

02:54.959 --> 02:58.899
and kiss his little toes
for me when he wakes up.

02:58.999 --> 03:01.275
When are you gonna talk to her?

03:01.375 --> 03:03.734
Oh, she's just excited.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.899
Excited, obsessed.

03:05.999 --> 03:08.983
Why, because she wants
to watch her nephew sleep?

03:09.083 --> 03:11.526
Yesterday she was giving you
breast-feeding advice,

03:11.626 --> 03:13.109
and now she wants
maternity leave?

03:13.209 --> 03:16.025
Well, she knows a
lot about breasts.

03:16.125 --> 03:19.567
And she's an aunt, that's what
they do, it's family, you know.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.983
Okay. Well, how is Mommy doing?

03:22.083 --> 03:26.584
- Mommy's tired and happy.
- Mm.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.025
- Now try and get some sleep.
- Mm-hm.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.899
[ALARM RINGING]

it's all right. You're okay.

It just pisses me off.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.900
They come in the house and
try to steal the baby.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.442
Demons aren't known
for their moral compass.

05:31.542 --> 05:34.442
He'll be safe with
the Elders until we
can figure it out.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.651
But he's just a baby.
He is small and little
and innocent--

05:37.751 --> 05:40.150
It's okay. He's got that
invincibility thing going on.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.900
Do you think that's permanent or
is it like a baby-teeth thing?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.067
I have no idea, but the
demons saw the force field.

05:45.167 --> 05:46.899
They're gonna try and
find a way around it.

05:46.999 --> 05:49.899
Unless they can get up to
Elder-land, he's gonna be fine.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.275
He can't stay
up there forever.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.818
That's what
we're here for.

05:52.918 --> 05:55.751
No one is gonna steal him.
I promise you that.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.317
- PIPER: Leo?
- They wouldn't keep him.

06:01.417 --> 06:04.067
What? Why? Did you tell
them what's going on?

06:04.167 --> 06:06.651
They want us to prove
to ourselves that we
can protect him,

06:06.751 --> 06:08.484
like your mom
and Grams did for you.

We don't need them anyway.
It's all right.

You okay?

06:17.999 --> 06:20.401
I'm having some severe
separation-anxiety issues.

06:20.501 --> 06:22.899
We can do this, honey.

Hey, here he is.
The Hawker demon.

"A breed of demon known for
hawking magical goods at the
demonic market."

06:30.083 --> 06:33.734
Magical goods?
My baby is a magical good?

06:33.834 --> 06:35.109
That is just
sick and twisted.

06:35.209 --> 06:38.526
The question is, who would
want to buy him and why?

06:38.626 --> 06:40.501
[CHATTERING]

06:56.626 --> 06:59.983
We paid you for a baby.
Not a gypsy.

07:00.083 --> 07:03.150
I told you that the little brat
had a force field protecting it.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.692
Which is why we want it,
you idiot.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.359
The shield is what makes
that kid a perfect battery.

07:08.459 --> 07:11.899
A self-sustaining, never-ending
source of magical power.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.609
We tap into that power

07:13.709 --> 07:15.942
and it will return us
to our former strength.

07:16.042 --> 07:18.899
Or would you have us
stay weaklings, Hawker?

07:18.999 --> 07:21.692
Doomed to feed on
the magic of others forever.

07:21.792 --> 07:24.818
Look, I am sorry
that the witch cursed you.

07:24.918 --> 07:27.859
And I'm sorry that you
lost all of your powers.

But it's not my fault.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.234
The task these
leeches seek you for

08:19.334 --> 08:21.818
will bring only death
and destruction.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.899
And not to our enemies.

08:23.999 --> 08:26.459
Turn them away.

The Crone's wisdom
is ancient and renowned.

08:44.999 --> 08:47.899
I have already lost
one demon on this job.

08:47.999 --> 08:52.192
Now, you either
take the gypsy, or nothing.

08:52.292 --> 08:55.484
We'll take the gypsy
to tide us over.

08:55.584 --> 08:57.776
And we'll double
the bounty on the infant.

08:57.876 --> 09:00.526
Or maybe we'll pay
that to another hawker.

09:00.626 --> 09:03.542
In which case,
the bounty will be on your head.

of a choice, but there it is.

23:26.209 --> 23:30.584
from the last few weeks.
And they've become very...

23:34.250 --> 23:37.899
- What?
- Baby-centric.

23:37.999 --> 23:41.025
They're all about diapers
and mother's milk.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.942
They don't even read like you.
They've lost your edge.
You're sexy.

23:44.042 --> 23:49.899
Well, any writer, any good
writer, uses their life
experiences in their work.

23:49.999 --> 23:52.234
That's true. But if all
you've got to inform your work

23:52.334 --> 23:55.192
is someone else's baby,
maybe you need to
re-evaluate your priorities.

23:55.292 --> 23:59.025
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean, but,
Phoebe, your brother-in-law's
on the phone.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.818
And it's the third time
he's called.

24:00.918 --> 24:02.417
What? Why didn't you tell me?

24:08.250 --> 24:10.609
I don't understand,
why didn't you just orb for me

24:10.709 --> 24:12.067
when they wouldn't put you
through?

24:12.167 --> 24:14.899
I didn't want to leave the house
unless it was absolutely
necessary.

24:14.999 --> 24:17.942
Oh, right. Okay, so there
was another kidnap attempt?

24:18.042 --> 24:19.501
[WHISPERS]
Yes. Shh!

24:21.334 --> 24:23.025
I can't believe
they didn't put you through!

24:23.125 --> 24:24.899
They said you were
in an important meeting

24:24.999 --> 24:26.899
and the boss said
you shouldn't be disturbed.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.442
Unbelievable. And he says
I have my priorities mixed up?

24:29.542 --> 24:30.899
- Who?
- Jason Dean.

24:30.999 --> 24:32.651
Jason? Jason Halli--

24:32.751 --> 24:34.526
Oh, don't even
thing about it, mister.

24:34.626 --> 24:36.150

Please tell me you
didn't get fired.

24:36.250 --> 24:39.442
Oh, no, I--
I don't think I did.

24:39.542 --> 24:42.234
- [ALARM RINGING]
- What the hell is that?

24:42.334 --> 24:43.776
- Baby alarm.
- Baby alarm.

What?

24:45.501 --> 24:46.542
[BABY CRYING]

24:52.292 --> 24:55.942
I know, so much excitement.
What was that alerting us to
exactly?

24:56.042 --> 24:58.651
Demons. There's supposed
to be demons in the house.

24:58.751 --> 25:01.150
Look at that,
he's not even crying.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.900
You are so brave. You're like
a little brave soldier.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.899
Maybe the alarm is faulty.

25:05.999 --> 25:09.234
- Paige would know.
- Where is Paige?

25:09.334 --> 25:11.234
LEO: Paige?

25:11.334 --> 25:13.150
Oh, my God, she's not here.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.025
Okay, why is that
an "Oh, my God"?

25:15.125 --> 25:16.834
And the scrying tools are out.

25:18.459 --> 25:20.734
The hand-grenade potion is gone.

25:20.834 --> 25:23.417
Will someone please
tell me what's going on here?

25:24.792 --> 25:27.401
- What is that, a spell?
- No, it's a note.

25:27.501 --> 25:29.651
"Gone to market. Back soon."

25:29.751 --> 25:31.292
Okay, well,
that's good news, right?

25:32.626 --> 25:35.375
She went to the market.
Right?

25:45.667 --> 25:49.899
Come on, guys, this is
top-of-the-line. The power to
throw fireballs 20 yards.

25:49.999 --> 25:51.983
Now, let me hear
a serious offer.

25:52.083 --> 25:56.526
Now, if you need new powers,
there's where to go.

You're such a
great tour guide.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.983

little something extra?

26:01.083 --> 26:03.899
You didn't become a demon
to just stand on the sidelines.

26:03.999 --> 26:07.999
Now, watch and see what my
permeatonic can do for you.

I'll take some.

26:23.501 --> 26:26.899
I think up there's the
guys you're looking for.
The parasites.

26:26.999 --> 26:29.025
Oh, parasites?
Should I be frightened?

26:29.125 --> 26:30.899
No. They were badass once,

26:30.999 --> 26:33.899
but some witch cursed them,
took away their powers.

26:33.999 --> 26:36.818
Pitiful little bastards. Even a
girl like you could take them.

26:36.918 --> 26:40.818
Oh, really, a girl like me?
Then I might just have to.

26:40.918 --> 26:44.609
Well, thank you for the tour.
I suppose you'll be
wanting your payment now.

26:44.709 --> 26:46.999
You know I will.

Hey!

26:55.334 --> 26:57.792
Sorry, he was getting
a little grabby.

27:05.626 --> 27:09.000
Excuse me. Anyone here
interested in the
Charmed Ones' offspring?

27:11.709 --> 27:12.899
Who are you?

27:12.999 --> 27:15.442
I'm the reason you're not
gonna need that food anymore.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.442
Not after you hear
what I have to say.

27:17.542 --> 27:20.876
The food is dead.

27:22.999 --> 27:27.025
- You were saying?
- Just that the Hawker
who hired me to grab the baby

27:27.125 --> 27:29.275
screwed up the job
and got himself dead.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.834
He didn't say who hired him,
but I heard it was you.

27:33.709 --> 27:34.899
So, what if it was?

27:34.999 --> 27:38.109
Don't get nervous.
I'm just here for the bounty.

27:38.209 --> 27:39.734
The offer still stands, right?

27:39.834 --> 27:43.067
First, tell us why
you're still alive.

27:43.167 --> 27:45.042
I'll take that as a yes.

Come on, people, talk to me.

28:09.459 --> 28:12.651
Bingo. We have
a location of the market.

28:12.751 --> 28:14.692
Yes. Anything on Paige?

28:14.792 --> 28:17.651
I can't sense her at all.
But that doesn't mean
we should panic.

28:17.751 --> 28:19.983
Her signal might be blocked
by the magic at the marketplace.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.734
Right, there's no
reason to panic.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.317
Our sister went alone
to Demonville,

28:23.417 --> 28:25.192
she has no idea what
or who she's up against,

28:25.292 --> 28:27.109
so there's no reason
to panic, right?

28:27.209 --> 28:29.776
Phoebe, it was my fault.
I should have gone with her.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.818
I would have gone with her,
had she called me.

28:32.918 --> 28:36.192
I told her not to bother you,
because you was trying to
impress your new boss.

28:36.292 --> 28:39.818
I was not trying to impress
my new boss, thank you.

28:39.918 --> 28:42.359
- You weren't?
But this morning--
- Well--

28:42.459 --> 28:44.776
Okay, maybe this morning
I was trying to impress him.

28:44.876 --> 28:47.899
But I'm not. So can we talk
about anything but Jason Dean,
please?

28:47.999 --> 28:50.942
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, let's talk about
how we're gonna find Paige.

28:51.042 --> 28:52.818
Oh.

28:52.918 --> 28:54.899
Well, we're gonna write
a spell that's gonna carry
us to the market.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.459
Can I have some paper?

29:08.292 --> 29:10.818
- Are you okay?
- No. It's time to panic.

- But what?

29:21.542 --> 29:25.484

kind who cursed us to this life.

29:27.083 --> 29:31.234
Say we kill her, get revenge
on yet another witch.

29:31.334 --> 29:33.818
Then what?
We're still parasites.

29:33.918 --> 29:35.899
Nothing will have changed.

29:35.999 --> 29:38.526
She'll be dead.
That's change.

29:38.626 --> 29:41.234
But we'll still be bound
to this trivial existence.

29:41.334 --> 29:45.025
Think about it.
She's a Charmed One.

29:45.125 --> 29:48.275
Her sisters will sense her
if we keep her alive.

29:48.375 --> 29:51.776
And then, they will
come for her.

29:51.876 --> 29:56.734
And when they do, the infant
will be left vulnerable.

29:56.834 --> 29:58.501
No.

30:02.542 --> 30:04.025
Anything?

30:04.125 --> 30:06.109
Unless they're invisible,
there's no demons in this house.

30:06.209 --> 30:08.401
Then why does
the alarm keep going off?

30:08.501 --> 30:10.192
- We'd have to ask Paige.
- We better hurry

30:10.292 --> 30:12.275
because from what I saw,
she doesn't have much time.

30:12.375 --> 30:15.526
You want me to leave
my baby when the alarm
designed to sense evil

30:15.626 --> 30:17.025
is going off
every ten minutes?

30:17.125 --> 30:19.526
Believe me, Piper, I don't
want to leave the baby either,

30:19.626 --> 30:22.109
but the alarm is broken.
There is no evil in this house.

30:22.209 --> 30:24.818
But we've gone up against
invisible demons before.

30:24.918 --> 30:28.651
You know, demons that morph into
lamps, lamps that morph into
demons, demons in the walls...

30:28.751 --> 30:32.999
Don't you think if they
were here, they'd be
attacking the baby by now?

30:34.375 --> 30:36.692
Oh, look at him,
he's smiling!

30:36.792 --> 30:38.692
Oh, you are so brave.

30:38.792 --> 30:41.334
- He's smiling?
- Either that or he has gas.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.192
- Piper, put him down.
- What?

30:45.292 --> 30:47.859
He was crying
when the demon attacked.

30:47.959 --> 30:50.150
- So?
- So just put him down a minute

30:50.250 --> 30:51.484

He's using his powers
to set off the alarm.

Because he figured out,
when it goes off,
that we all come running.

31:25.375 --> 31:28.150

attention. He's a genius.

think she foresaw?

37:26.834 --> 37:28.709
I wish I knew.

37:34.542 --> 37:37.734
Oh, I could eat you.
Yes, I could.

37:37.834 --> 37:39.401
- PHOEBE: Yes, I could.
- PIPER: Pheebs.

37:39.501 --> 37:44.776
After the demonic parasites did
want to eat him, not so cute.

37:44.876 --> 37:46.484
Gotcha.

37:46.584 --> 37:50.818
Oh, I could smoosh you.
I could just smoosh
your little face.

37:50.918 --> 37:52.484
Much better.

37:52.584 --> 37:54.899
Is that his new name,
Smoosh Face Halliwell?

37:54.999 --> 37:57.734
It's about as good as everything
else we've come up with.

37:57.834 --> 38:00.776
- No new ideas, huh?
- Actually--

38:00.876 --> 38:02.818
You know, we've been
so busy with the alarm

38:02.918 --> 38:05.609
and the demon-fighting
and the sister-saving...

38:05.709 --> 38:08.275
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be sorry, Paige.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.359
You were brave,
and you inspired me to fight

38:10.459 --> 38:12.899
and you made the world
a safer place for our baby.

38:12.999 --> 38:16.692
Which is why I would like to
give the baby the middle name
of Matthew,

38:16.792 --> 38:20.567
in honor of his
super-protective Aunt Paige.

38:20.667 --> 38:22.317
I think that's a great idea.

38:22.417 --> 38:24.584
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

38:25.999 --> 38:26.942
Thanks.

38:27.042 --> 38:30.025
And I also have
an idea for his first name.

38:30.125 --> 38:33.999
Wyatt. In honor of his
very protective daddy.

38:34.999 --> 38:36.776
Really?

38:36.876 --> 38:38.359
Well, it doesn't start with a P.

38:38.459 --> 38:40.209
So we break the tradition.

38:41.709 --> 38:43.359
Hi, baby.

38:43.459 --> 38:46.526
Happy baby.

38:46.626 --> 38:49.167
Why don't we ask him?

38:51.209 --> 38:54.651
That's probably your job.

38:54.751 --> 38:58.899
Wyatt Matthew Halliwell,
is that your name?

38:58.999 --> 39:02.542
What do you think?
It's a good one.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.542
It's a good one.

39:26.792 --> 39:27.999
[KNOCKING]

39:29.501 --> 39:30.876
I thought you'd
still be here.

39:32.042 --> 39:35.334
Yeah, well,
there's a lot to do.

39:37.999 --> 39:39.042
Um...

39:39.999 --> 39:43.667
I just came by to say that...

39:44.584 --> 39:45.859
...I'm really sorry.

39:45.959 --> 39:47.899
Huh.

39:47.999 --> 39:50.692
I didn't figure you for
the type to apologize easily.

39:50.792 --> 39:54.876
Yeah, I'm not.
I only apologize when I'm wrong.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.234
And, okay, I wasn't
entirely wrong.

39:57.334 --> 39:59.609
There was an emergency
at home and I did need to leave.

39:59.709 --> 40:02.275
In the future, if you're
gonna hold my calls,
I hope you tell me.

40:02.375 --> 40:06.526
- This is an apology?
- Yes, because about
the other stuff...

40:06.626 --> 40:08.567
...you were right.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.442
I got overwhelmed by the baby
and I lost my voice.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.234
- My perspective.
- That's really--

40:14.334 --> 40:16.899
It's just that since we
were kids, we always shared
everything equally.

40:16.999 --> 40:19.899
So when the baby came,
I just thought it should
be the same way.

40:19.999 --> 40:22.067
You know, which is ridiculous
because I'm not his mom,
I'm his aunt.

40:22.167 --> 40:24.651
And it works out great for me
because moms have to parent,

40:24.751 --> 40:26.692
you know, and I just
get to spoil.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.484
Well, that's understandable--

40:28.584 --> 40:30.651
And I know you're really busy
and you don't need to be
listening

40:30.751 --> 40:33.542
to some advice columnist's
psychobabble, but, um...

40:34.959 --> 40:36.167
...if I still have a job...

40:37.876 --> 40:40.899
...I promise you'll see all
the changes you're looking for

40:40.999 --> 40:42.567
in my column
first thing in the morning.

40:42.667 --> 40:44.234
Great.

40:44.334 --> 40:46.900
- Can I talk now?
- Oh, yeah.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.899
I knew less about
my last girlfriend's family

40:48.999 --> 40:51.150
than I've learned about yours
in the last five minutes.

40:51.250 --> 40:52.776
- Oh, I'm really--
- Still talking.

40:52.876 --> 40:55.234
- Sorry.
- I am busy.

40:55.334 --> 40:57.275
But making this paper work
is important to me.

40:57.375 --> 41:00.859
If that means listening
to an advice columnist's
late-night psychobabble,

41:00.959 --> 41:02.359
then that's what
I'm willing to do.

41:02.459 --> 41:04.109
- That's-- Right.
- Still talking.

41:04.209 --> 41:07.234
This paper can't afford
to lose you, Phoebe.
You're too valuable.

41:07.334 --> 41:11.375
Too talented. And if you can
admit where you were wrong,
then so can I.

41:12.209 --> 41:14.109
- So?
- So...

41:14.209 --> 41:18.899
...in the future, if I
have to hold your calls,
I'll let you know.

41:18.999 --> 41:21.292
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
Done talking.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.918
Okay.

41:36.459 --> 41:37.999
I'll just...
