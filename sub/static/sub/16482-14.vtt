00:03.203 --> 00:04.802
Get your asses in the car.

00:04.804 --> 00:06.241
Wow.

00:06.266 --> 00:10.241
- Guys, this is Rebecca Malone.
- Um, it's Pearson now.

00:10.266 --> 00:11.108
Oh.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.634
You forgot this girl you
used to play keys for got old.

00:13.636 --> 00:15.470
- Not from where I'm standing.
- Being on stage again

00:15.472 --> 00:17.805
and singing and... I missed it.

00:17.807 --> 00:20.374
Randall is not free of vice.

00:20.376 --> 00:23.111
It's his compulsive drive to be perfect.

00:23.113 --> 00:25.746
Randall, do you know Sanjay
Jahiri? Sanjay's gonna

00:25.748 --> 00:27.648
come aboard, help us land
a new wind farm client.

00:27.650 --> 00:28.683
- Really? <i>
- I'd marry</i>

00:28.685 --> 00:30.318
the hell out of you, Kate Pearson.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.153
- Just like that?
- Just like that?

00:32.155 --> 00:34.622
It was "just like that" from
the moment I met you, kid.

00:34.624 --> 00:35.957
Have you ever considered

00:35.959 --> 00:36.924
an immersive weight-loss experience?

00:36.926 --> 00:38.559
A fat camp?

00:38.561 --> 00:41.062
I have a boyfriend.
Well, actually, fiancÃ©.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.196
We'll see.

00:43.666 --> 00:45.500
The medication isn't working anymore.

00:45.502 --> 00:48.402
Do you want to stop the chemo, William?

00:48.404 --> 00:50.604
There's something I've always
wanted to do before I die.

00:53.409 --> 00:54.809
Hi.

00:54.811 --> 00:56.844
My ex-husband,

00:56.846 --> 00:59.147
who I haven't seen in 12 years...

00:59.149 --> 01:01.816
just shows up at my doorstep, unannounced.

01:01.818 --> 01:05.319
You know, I'm not exactly
sure what you want me to say.

01:19.469 --> 01:20.640
<i>Okay, excuse me,</i>

01:20.665 --> 01:22.541
everyone. May I have
everyone's attention, please.

01:22.549 --> 01:23.876
I'd like to say a few words.

01:23.969 --> 01:25.469
Most of you guys know me

01:25.471 --> 01:29.206
as Jack's best friend and,
uh, former better half.

01:29.525 --> 01:31.080
Today's a special day.

01:32.001 --> 01:34.845
My favorite people got married at City Hall

01:34.847 --> 01:36.580
and I got to pay off my parking tickets.

01:36.582 --> 01:38.816
So it's a win-win for everyone.

01:38.818 --> 01:41.072
Thank you. One laugh, that's it?

01:41.236 --> 01:43.302
It was... you can, uh, all thank

01:43.327 --> 01:46.407
my beautiful yet unfunny wife,
Shelly, for that last one.

01:47.306 --> 01:49.447
Rebecca, actually, I have to apologize.

01:49.978 --> 01:51.711
For the first two months
of your relationship...

01:51.713 --> 01:54.080
Jack bailed on me so much

01:54.159 --> 01:55.700
to go out with you that, uh,

01:55.965 --> 01:57.731
I started referring to you as Yoko Ono.

01:57.756 --> 01:59.887
I'm sorry. But then Jack

01:59.912 --> 02:01.989
started using words like "soul mate"

02:02.653 --> 02:03.731
and "forever."

02:04.224 --> 02:06.725
And he never really said stuff like that

02:06.727 --> 02:08.059
until he met you.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.596
Actually, he never really said much at all.

02:11.621 --> 02:14.433
That's what I liked best about him, really.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.601
You know, marriage is not something that

02:16.603 --> 02:18.336
you enter into lightly.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.806
<i>And I was listening
to your vows, and, um,</i>

02:20.808 --> 02:24.042
<i>you promised to keep
the passion alive.</i>

02:24.044 --> 02:26.344
Soap dispenser down!

02:26.346 --> 02:27.813
We'll fix it later.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.248
<i>And you promised to be
by each other's sides,</i>

02:30.250 --> 02:31.683
<i>in sickness and health.</i>

02:31.685 --> 02:33.351
I'm never eating oysters again.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.286
Okay.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.154
And to make each other laugh

02:36.156 --> 02:37.956
every single day.

02:39.259 --> 02:40.659
Mm...

02:40.661 --> 02:42.093
- Uh-uh. Jack...
- Mm-hmm.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.822
Do not. Don't you dare.

02:46.001 --> 02:47.900
<i>You guys made some pretty
big promises to each other.</i>

02:47.925 --> 02:49.258
Are you kidding me?

02:49.260 --> 02:51.927
<i>But if I trust anyone to keep them,</i>

02:51.929 --> 02:53.295
it's the two of you.

02:54.482 --> 02:55.831
I love you guys.

02:55.833 --> 02:57.166
To Jack and Rebecca.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.745
We're meeting them at the restaurant.

03:09.747 --> 03:10.724
Mm-hmm.

03:11.811 --> 03:13.111
- At 8:00?
- Yeah.

03:13.113 --> 03:14.193
Mm.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.904
- Mom, can I have a tampon?
- Yeah.

03:23.396 --> 03:24.873
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.805
So I'm on my way down to the basement

03:27.807 --> 03:30.332
with a load of whites, and there's Kevin

03:30.372 --> 03:33.396
trying to sneak a girl
out the basement door.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.302
Ever since we moved him down there,

03:36.327 --> 03:38.127
it's like we gave the kid a bachelor pad.

03:38.129 --> 03:39.929
You know?

03:39.931 --> 03:42.131
You guys, honestly, it is so nice

03:42.133 --> 03:44.099
to be out to dinner.

03:44.101 --> 03:47.002
I mean, between the kids and the band now

03:47.004 --> 03:48.737
and your work schedule,

03:48.739 --> 03:51.240
I feel like we never get this
kind of time for ourselves.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.909
Yeah. I mean, I pretty
much have to go to a show

03:53.911 --> 03:55.911
if I want to schedule
time with my wife nowadays.

03:57.525 --> 03:58.908
That's not really fair.

03:59.799 --> 04:02.127
Neither is <i> Ben</i> keeping you out till,

04:02.244 --> 04:04.518
you know, well beyond 11:00 most nights.

04:05.223 --> 04:06.813
He doesn't keep me out past 11:00.

04:06.838 --> 04:07.900
I'm teasing you.

04:16.745 --> 04:18.728
Um, Miguel and I have
something to tell you.

04:18.754 --> 04:20.166
Yeah? What?

04:22.276 --> 04:23.580
We're getting divorced.

04:25.658 --> 04:26.494
What?

04:26.814 --> 04:30.104
Yeah, um, it's, uh...

04:31.440 --> 04:33.127
It's not an easy decision.

04:33.283 --> 04:36.885
But obviously things haven't
been right with us for some time,

04:37.049 --> 04:39.018
- but, um, it's for the best.
- Yeah.

04:40.362 --> 04:43.329
And we want to do it
before things get ugly,

04:43.331 --> 04:45.308
and we're still friends,

04:45.894 --> 04:49.159
and we can co-parent, and...
it's... it's a good thing.

04:52.589 --> 04:53.847
Miguel and Shelly?

04:55.268 --> 04:58.080
They're... Miguel and Shelly.

04:58.550 --> 05:00.050
They can't get divorced.

05:00.052 --> 05:02.019
She's been unhappy.

05:03.433 --> 05:06.200
And you heard them...
there wasn't one thing,

05:06.202 --> 05:07.768
- it just happened.
- No.

05:07.770 --> 05:09.570
No, come on, that's BS.

05:09.572 --> 05:11.239
You don't do that to your family.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.707
You find your soul mate, you get married,

05:12.709 --> 05:15.560
you stay together until you die, period.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.264
It's not always that simple.

05:21.787 --> 05:23.184
It is to me.

05:23.474 --> 05:25.353
Well, not everyone is you.

05:25.378 --> 05:28.145
And sometimes people just...

05:28.506 --> 05:29.924
drift apart.

05:32.897 --> 05:33.865
I wasn't...

05:35.014 --> 05:36.256
I wasn't talking about us.

05:36.281 --> 05:38.193
I'm not Shelly, you're not Miguel.

05:38.431 --> 05:39.818
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.696
- Good night.
- Good night.

05:59.405 --> 06:00.662
Hello?

06:03.951 --> 06:04.982
Beth?

06:05.467 --> 06:07.115
Annie? Tess?

06:09.703 --> 06:10.685
William?

06:16.932 --> 06:18.161
There you are.

06:18.657 --> 06:19.934
Where is everybody?

06:26.606 --> 06:27.473
William?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.147
Daddy?

06:30.149 --> 06:31.122
You okay?

06:32.379 --> 06:33.451
What's up, baby?

06:33.453 --> 06:34.653
I peed in the bed.

06:35.403 --> 06:37.036
Oh, that's okay, sweetheart.

06:38.725 --> 06:40.129
Yeah, it's all right.

06:40.926 --> 06:42.512
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

06:43.933 --> 06:46.152
Let's get you some dry clothes, okay?

06:48.103 --> 06:50.090
Annie, where's your sister?

06:52.754 --> 06:54.137
No, no, no, no, no.

06:54.162 --> 06:56.640
You have to always defend your queen, Tess.

06:57.239 --> 06:59.317
See? You left yourself wide open.

06:59.342 --> 07:00.426
Remember that.

07:01.676 --> 07:03.090
It's past midnight.

07:03.115 --> 07:04.575
Don't be mad at Grandpa.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.122
- Nobody's mad.
- I'm a little mad.

07:06.147 --> 07:08.575
Nobody's mad. We're just confused.

07:09.653 --> 07:11.840
Well, Tess asked me to
teach her how to play chess,

07:11.865 --> 07:13.950
'cause she's got a tournament
at school tomorrow night.

07:13.981 --> 07:16.081
Well, I guess, technically, it's tonight.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.850
- When did you enter a chess...
- Last month.

07:18.575 --> 07:19.965
I wrote it on the white board.

07:20.921 --> 07:22.723
Oh, we've got to remember
to check the white board.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.887
I didn't even know that was still there.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.469
Well, honey, you can't be playing chess

07:26.494 --> 07:27.593
at 3:00 in the morning.

07:27.595 --> 07:28.861
But Grandpa's always napping

07:28.863 --> 07:30.462
when I get home from school.

07:30.464 --> 07:32.664
And I have soccer on Saturdays.

07:32.666 --> 07:34.697
You said he's not going
to be around forever,

07:34.722 --> 07:36.758
so I have to play with
him as much as I can now.

07:36.783 --> 07:38.273
You have plenty of time
to play chess with William.

07:38.298 --> 07:40.494
Now, come on, let's go. Upstairs.

07:40.978 --> 07:42.814
You and Annie can sleep with us tonight.

07:43.916 --> 07:45.689
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.244
I'm sorry.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.603
She's right, you know.

07:54.939 --> 07:56.423
We're running out of time.

07:58.892 --> 07:59.947
It's late.

08:00.928 --> 08:03.064
We all need to get some sleep.

08:04.291 --> 08:05.400
Good night.

08:27.758 --> 08:28.820
Good morning.

08:29.224 --> 08:30.265
Hi.

08:30.870 --> 08:34.381
This is gonna sound so weird.
Um... I need this booth.

08:35.984 --> 08:38.195
George, our eggs haven't come yet.

08:38.220 --> 08:40.756
George, is it, yeah?
George, that is a great hat.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.313
You know, if I were ever to be able

08:42.337 --> 08:44.047
to pull off a hat like
that, I would consider myself

08:44.072 --> 08:46.174
a very... lucky man.

08:50.746 --> 08:52.395
So here's the thing, um...

08:53.865 --> 08:56.216
this is a special booth, all right? Um...

08:56.724 --> 08:58.919
It was at this booth where, uh,

08:59.703 --> 09:01.339
my ex-wife and I had lunch

09:01.364 --> 09:03.536
during our eighth grade class
trip to the Statue of Liberty.

09:03.561 --> 09:05.833
And I got seasick on
the ferry ride out there.

09:05.858 --> 09:08.258
It was awful, until she kissed me.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.673
Right? And that happened right here.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.179
Right here at this booth.

09:14.204 --> 09:16.837
And it was also at this very
booth where we had the conversation

09:16.862 --> 09:19.071
where we decided that I
was gonna follow my dreams,

09:19.399 --> 09:21.110
and I was gonna move to Los Angeles,

09:21.135 --> 09:22.444
and she was gonna stay here.

09:22.446 --> 09:24.243
And we sat here until the place closed,

09:24.268 --> 09:25.399
trying to convince each other

09:25.424 --> 09:26.946
that we could handle the distance.

09:27.727 --> 09:28.852
And we were wrong.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.987
And, uh, now here we
are. It's been 12 years,

09:31.989 --> 09:34.579
and she's agreed to
meet me here today. So...

09:36.678 --> 09:38.383
see, I really need this booth.

09:40.345 --> 09:42.178
Were you <i> The Manny?</i>

09:43.344 --> 09:44.981
Oh, my God. Uh, yeah.

09:45.219 --> 09:46.258
Yeah, I was.

09:47.283 --> 09:48.816
Sign my napkin.

09:50.288 --> 09:52.540
Uh... sure.

09:55.563 --> 09:57.160
Okay, come on, George.

09:57.162 --> 09:58.751
Let's give this young man the booth.

09:58.776 --> 10:00.290
Thank you very much.

10:00.954 --> 10:02.298
All right.

10:03.134 --> 10:04.701
Tell you what, let me help you out there,

10:04.703 --> 10:06.202
'cause she's gonna be
coming in hot any minute now.

10:06.204 --> 10:08.104
You know what I mean? Excu... Lava fries.

10:08.106 --> 10:09.672
Fast as you can, please, thank you.

10:17.822 --> 10:19.533
Oh. You look phenomenal.

10:19.558 --> 10:21.651
What the hell is the
matter with you, Kevin?

10:21.653 --> 10:23.619
- Stunning.
- Huh? Who the hell do you think

10:23.621 --> 10:25.086
you are, just showing up
at my doorstep like that?

10:25.111 --> 10:27.689
Do you have any idea how invasive that is?

10:28.806 --> 10:29.859
You better be dying.

10:29.861 --> 10:31.539
And soon. But you're not, are you?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.133
No. Look at you. You're glowing.

10:33.158 --> 10:35.259
God, that is so annoying.
Why don't you age?

10:35.666 --> 10:38.281
Look, I only came here today to
tell you to go screw yourself.

10:38.306 --> 10:39.353
Lava fries.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.258
Damn it.

11:07.319 --> 11:08.985
Thank God for yoga.

11:08.987 --> 11:10.920
I know. I'm this close to
pulling off the crow pose.

11:10.945 --> 11:12.491
- Yeah?
- Never gonna happen.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.436
You're such a prick.

11:15.037 --> 11:16.803
I take that as a compliment.

11:17.116 --> 11:18.076
Hi, Kate.

11:18.764 --> 11:19.834
Lookin' fine.

11:24.567 --> 11:27.630
_

11:27.891 --> 11:29.823
Oh, I'll see you later.

11:29.848 --> 11:31.956
Okay.

11:38.854 --> 11:40.104
Toby.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.924
Hey! I'm your package!

11:45.932 --> 11:47.290
What are you doing here?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.352
I thought I'd bring you a
little pick-me-up, you know?

11:49.377 --> 11:50.515
I packed up some of your favorite things.

11:50.517 --> 11:52.718
We got four months' worth
of <i> EW</i> magazines,

11:52.720 --> 11:55.218
we got that body wash that
makes you smell like Hawaii.

11:55.243 --> 11:56.796
Aw, you are so sweet.

11:56.821 --> 11:58.056
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:58.058 --> 11:59.858
- Mwah.
- Ah, but, first,

11:59.883 --> 12:01.259
you got to give me a tour of this place.

12:01.261 --> 12:02.494
This place is incredible.

12:02.496 --> 12:04.718
I've never seen so much
good wood in one place.

12:04.743 --> 12:06.131
But after the tour,

12:06.133 --> 12:07.532
we're going into town.

12:08.008 --> 12:09.633
Because I got us a hotel room.

12:09.993 --> 12:13.046
Because I have been
cleared for some low-impact

12:13.071 --> 12:15.946
lovemaking. None of that crazy
stuff you're into, all right?

12:18.079 --> 12:19.149
Tobe, I can't.

12:19.884 --> 12:20.860
Why not?

12:21.052 --> 12:23.539
Uh, because they keep us
on a really tight schedule.

12:23.907 --> 12:25.032
Okay, okay.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.875
You know what, screw it.

12:27.891 --> 12:30.053
- I will. I... I'll miss a few classes
- No, no, no, no, no.

12:30.078 --> 12:32.060
I have screwed with your
progress in the past,

12:32.062 --> 12:33.094
and it won't happen again.

12:33.096 --> 12:34.529
You go to your class, all right?

12:34.531 --> 12:36.122
You do not miss one, all right?

12:36.147 --> 12:37.397
You go to all of them.

12:37.780 --> 12:39.192
- Whatever's on the schedule.
- Okay.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.135
Okay?

12:42.303 --> 12:44.045
You are the sweetest man

12:44.217 --> 12:45.434
in the whole world.

12:45.459 --> 12:46.841
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.288
- I will call you. I promise.
- Okay.

12:49.313 --> 12:50.310
Okay.

12:50.842 --> 12:52.781
<i>So like we discussed on the phone,</i>

12:52.783 --> 12:55.388
the oncologist estimates he's
only got a few more months.

12:55.413 --> 12:57.889
Which is why you guys were
right to seek palliative care.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.188
Our focus is making him more comfortable,

13:00.190 --> 13:02.390
whether that is pain
management or nutrition

13:02.392 --> 13:04.091
or getting you access to hospice nurses...

13:04.116 --> 13:05.427
Should we start digging his grave now

13:05.429 --> 13:07.577
or should we wait until
there's an actual body?

13:07.725 --> 13:08.725
Randall.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.006
Sorry.

13:12.694 --> 13:13.827
I didn't get much sleep.

13:14.772 --> 13:17.803
Obviously, we could use
some coping strategies.

13:17.967 --> 13:20.074
Um, we have two young girls

13:20.076 --> 13:22.864
- who are being affected...
- I have to get to work.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.903
Randall, you said you would take
the morning off so we could do this.

13:24.928 --> 13:27.145
I did take the morning off.
It's getting to be the afternoon.

13:27.170 --> 13:28.608
I can't miss the team meeting.

13:32.803 --> 13:34.199
I'm sorry. I'm tired. I, uh...

13:34.224 --> 13:36.670
I'll catch up with you tonight.

13:36.695 --> 13:38.176
It's nice to meet you, Simon.

13:38.201 --> 13:40.061
Well, don't forget we have her, um,

13:40.140 --> 13:42.318
chess tournament tonight now.

13:42.850 --> 13:43.897
Yeah.

13:45.006 --> 13:46.747
<i>It was either that</i>

13:46.772 --> 13:49.200
- or fork over two grand.
- No, you didn't.

13:49.225 --> 13:52.073
Uh, oh, good. Randall, you're here.

13:52.075 --> 13:53.942
Sorry. Family thing.

13:54.550 --> 13:56.878
So, Sanjay's derivative

13:56.880 --> 13:59.981
opened up a whole new
sector for us, wind power.

13:59.983 --> 14:01.816
Congrats again on figuring that out.

14:01.818 --> 14:04.908
I'd like to use this momentum to make
a play for the Oliver Energy Center.

14:04.933 --> 14:06.921
I've got history there. I'll
take him out for martinis

14:06.923 --> 14:08.890
and rib eyes, show him a
good time. I'll close this.

14:10.215 --> 14:12.191
Great. Uh, I'd like Sanjay to join you.

14:13.370 --> 14:14.980
Uh, all due respect, sir,

14:15.005 --> 14:17.636
but I've been doing this for 12
years. I don't need an assist.

14:18.723 --> 14:22.435
I-I know. You're, uh, terrific.
You both are. Which is...

14:22.831 --> 14:24.605
why I want you both in on this.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.527
I know the hostess at Bouley.

14:30.730 --> 14:33.231
- I can get us a res for dinner tonight.
- Tonight?

14:34.870 --> 14:36.620
You know what, tonight works great.

14:41.363 --> 14:43.316
I forgot how much I love watching you eat.

14:43.730 --> 14:45.143
You eat like a truck driver.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.949
You just think that 'cause
you eat like a rabbit.

14:46.974 --> 14:47.925
Maybe.

14:51.607 --> 14:53.974
So, why now, Kevin? Why
did you come find me?

14:58.225 --> 15:00.025
Because I never stopped thinking about you.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.973
So, tell me, you know, everything.

15:04.998 --> 15:06.664
Start from the beginning.
I want to know everything

15:06.666 --> 15:07.995
that happened to you since
the last time I saw you.

15:08.488 --> 15:09.488
Um...

15:10.988 --> 15:13.704
I'm a... I'm a nurse manager

15:13.706 --> 15:15.339
at Manhattan General Hospital.

15:15.341 --> 15:18.400
Wow. Nurse manager. That sounds great.

15:18.425 --> 15:20.011
Are you, like, the best nurse?

15:20.013 --> 15:20.728
You're the top nurse?

15:20.730 --> 15:23.291
- Yeah, I'm pretty badass.
- Yeah, you are.

15:25.088 --> 15:27.054
It's so nice to talk to you, you know?

15:28.127 --> 15:30.510
It's... finally pick up where we left off.

15:33.793 --> 15:35.065
Where we left off.

15:36.975 --> 15:39.476
Have you just forgotten where we left off?

15:39.501 --> 15:41.463
No, I didn't, I didn't, that's
not what I meant. I just...

15:41.488 --> 15:43.025
- You know what? This was a mistake.
- No, no.

15:43.050 --> 15:44.145
- Yeah.
- Just... just calm down.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.588
Hold on a... Sophie, hold on.

15:45.613 --> 15:46.823
Okay.

15:47.574 --> 15:48.588
Sophie!

15:48.842 --> 15:50.823
Excuse me, excuse me.
Sophie, hold on a second.

15:50.848 --> 15:52.487
You know, I forgot how
fast you are in heels.

15:52.512 --> 15:54.057
Will you please just
slow down a little bit?

15:54.082 --> 15:55.330
I just want to talk to you.

15:55.617 --> 15:56.849
What did I say?

15:56.874 --> 15:58.249
Sophie, will you please just slow down?

15:58.251 --> 15:59.721
Leave me alone.

15:59.746 --> 16:01.744
Why don't you stop so I can at
least talk to you for a second?

16:01.769 --> 16:03.588
About what? Where we left off?

16:03.590 --> 16:04.722
Kevin, where we left off
was you cheating on me

16:04.724 --> 16:06.290
and ruining our marriage.

16:06.292 --> 16:07.558
Look, okay, hey, listen,
listen, that's fair.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.693
You want to talk about the cheating?

16:08.695 --> 16:10.194
Fine, let's talk about the cheating.

16:10.196 --> 16:11.936
I don't want to do this with you.

16:20.473 --> 16:21.866
First day, huh?

16:21.891 --> 16:23.327
- Huh?
- Bro.

16:23.352 --> 16:24.257
Chin up.

16:24.436 --> 16:26.477
As long as you don't need
a crane to get off the sofa,

16:26.479 --> 16:27.421
you're gonna clean up around here.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.561
Oh, no, I'm not... doing...

16:28.598 --> 16:29.640
this camp...

16:30.093 --> 16:32.494
is crawling with women
who dropped a few stones

16:32.496 --> 16:36.064
and are feeling frisky,
especially on Thursdays.

16:36.066 --> 16:38.767
That's when everybody gets
their five ounces of white wine.

16:39.770 --> 16:40.781
Name's Duke.

16:41.515 --> 16:43.257
Uh... Toby.

16:43.422 --> 16:45.022
And I'm-I'm actually I'm not going here.

16:45.024 --> 16:48.132
I was just visiting somebody,
my, uh, fiancÃ©e, Kate.

16:50.507 --> 16:52.867
Oh. Well, that... ...just got awkward.

16:54.576 --> 16:55.874
Excuse me?

16:56.742 --> 16:59.312
Oh, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

16:59.758 --> 17:02.179
She's a cool girl. Good for you.

17:02.361 --> 17:03.499
Thanks.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.230
So, you've never heard
of a Puerto Rican Irish?

17:07.255 --> 17:08.882
- She's Puerto Rican?
- She's Puerto Rican.

17:08.906 --> 17:10.558
Maybe I'll learn. You know?

17:11.949 --> 17:12.925
Heather.

17:13.612 --> 17:14.987
Can you give us the room?

17:15.183 --> 17:16.166
Of course.

17:16.987 --> 17:19.722
- I'll be at my desk if you need me.
- I'm sure that I will.

17:26.237 --> 17:27.580
Hey.

17:28.753 --> 17:30.730
Are you having an affair with Heather?

17:33.058 --> 17:34.424
Are you crazy?

17:34.995 --> 17:36.426
Huh? I would never have an affair.

17:36.428 --> 17:37.794
I wouldn't do that to my kids.

17:38.097 --> 17:39.562
- So what then?
- What?

17:39.564 --> 17:41.297
What happened, huh?

17:41.299 --> 17:43.666
And don't tell me that
you just, you drifted.

17:43.668 --> 17:44.934
- We did, Jack.
- Yeah?

17:44.936 --> 17:46.330
We drift... yeah, we drifted, okay?

17:46.355 --> 17:48.771
And not everyone's like you and Rebecca.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.869
What do y...

17:51.596 --> 17:52.675
Do you want to know why

17:52.677 --> 17:53.791
my marriage ended, Jack?

17:54.393 --> 17:55.728
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

17:56.814 --> 18:00.516
Okay. Um... for as long as I can remember,

18:00.932 --> 18:04.486
I've woken up at 6:30 every
day to make Shelly coffee,

18:04.971 --> 18:06.869
splash of milk, two sugars.

18:07.494 --> 18:09.993
I would make it and bring it to her in bed.

18:10.361 --> 18:12.962
She says that her day

18:12.964 --> 18:15.596
doesn't even start until she's
got caffeine in her veins.

18:17.846 --> 18:21.518
And then one day, woke up, 6:30...

18:22.596 --> 18:24.955
like always, and I made myself one.

18:27.861 --> 18:29.812
I just didn't feel like making Shelly one.

18:29.932 --> 18:31.510
And the worst part is...

18:33.385 --> 18:34.884
she didn't even notice.

18:37.611 --> 18:40.260
We stopped noticing each other, Jack.

18:41.143 --> 18:43.564
We stopped trying to make each other happy.

18:44.049 --> 18:45.986
When we realized that, we knew it was over.

18:47.307 --> 18:49.532
Now, I think that every single couple

18:49.534 --> 18:52.769
has a handful of these moments
when you reach a crossroads.

18:52.771 --> 18:56.525
Just sometimes it happens
early on, first fight...

18:57.455 --> 18:58.975
sometimes it happens ten years in,

18:58.977 --> 19:01.444
when you've had the same fight
about taking out the trash

19:01.446 --> 19:02.900
every night for a week.

19:05.643 --> 19:07.447
They're make or break, these moments.

19:09.035 --> 19:11.035
And you either...

19:11.389 --> 19:13.222
...you either roll up your sleeves

19:13.224 --> 19:16.471
and you fight for what you've got or...

19:19.252 --> 19:21.080
...you decide that you're tired...

19:23.291 --> 19:24.658
...and you give up.

19:27.565 --> 19:29.572
And I had one of these moments...

19:30.790 --> 19:32.790
when I didn't make Shelly her coffee.

19:36.994 --> 19:40.072
âª My funny valentine âª

19:42.307 --> 19:46.956
âª Sweet, comic valentine âª

19:48.493 --> 19:51.260
âª You make me smile âª

19:51.916 --> 19:55.088
âª With my heart. âª

19:59.346 --> 20:01.170
Good night, guys. Thanks.

20:01.172 --> 20:03.906
All right, so, uh, Wednesday.
Wednesday, my place.

20:03.908 --> 20:06.242
Hey, uh, you okay?

20:06.244 --> 20:07.443
You seem off.

20:07.445 --> 20:10.179
Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

20:10.181 --> 20:11.814
- I just have a lot on my mind.
- All right.

20:11.975 --> 20:14.389
Well, uh, maybe this'll cheer you up.

20:14.719 --> 20:17.653
- Booking agent saw us play last week.
- Yeah?

20:17.655 --> 20:20.423
Wants us to be part of an East Coast tour.

20:20.905 --> 20:22.325
It's just gonna be us,

20:22.327 --> 20:24.427
couple of other great jazz bands,

20:24.429 --> 20:26.462
we're gonna be playing on actual stages...

20:26.464 --> 20:28.647
- ...to actual crowds.
- Wow.

20:29.756 --> 20:31.921
Ben, that's amazing.

20:33.772 --> 20:35.319
That's it? "That's amazing"?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.827
It's really great.

20:36.852 --> 20:40.143
I... I just have to talk to Jack

20:40.145 --> 20:42.412
because I have a family.

20:42.772 --> 20:45.014
I can't really just pick up and go.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.349
Rebecca, you deserve this.

20:46.351 --> 20:48.418
If Jack really loves you, he'll understand.

20:50.086 --> 20:52.887
I'm sorry. If Jack really loves me?

20:52.991 --> 20:54.957
- What is that?
- Oh. I didn't...

20:54.959 --> 20:58.194
You do realize my husband works
ten, sometimes 12 hours a day,

20:58.196 --> 21:00.897
and he comes home absolutely exhausted.

21:00.899 --> 21:03.466
And since I've joined this band,
he's picked up all the slack

21:03.468 --> 21:05.001
at home just so I could be here.

21:05.003 --> 21:07.203
Both of my boys play football,

21:07.205 --> 21:08.905
and he leaves work early every time

21:08.907 --> 21:11.741
so he can be there for each
and every one of their games.

21:11.743 --> 21:13.276
And they're on different teams, by the way.

21:13.278 --> 21:14.844
Just so they know that
someone's in the stand there

21:14.846 --> 21:16.646
to support them and love them.

21:16.648 --> 21:18.881
When we play that piano gig,

21:18.883 --> 21:20.783
and he's already gone to bed,

21:20.785 --> 21:23.853
he always leaves me a glass
of water on my bedside table,

21:23.855 --> 21:25.888
'cause he's worried I'm
not drinking enough water,

21:25.890 --> 21:27.390
especially when I'm singing.

21:27.392 --> 21:29.492
So, please, Ben, please do not tell me

21:29.494 --> 21:31.861
what Jack would do if he really loved me.

21:31.863 --> 21:33.429
My husband's a freaking superhero,

21:33.431 --> 21:35.298
and you have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.365
- Okay, sorry.
- It's okay.

21:36.367 --> 21:37.538
I overstepped.

21:37.616 --> 21:38.788
It's okay.

21:39.003 --> 21:40.171
- Have a good night.
- Okay.

21:43.319 --> 21:45.475
So I made this for my father

21:45.554 --> 21:46.920
after he passed away.

21:47.343 --> 21:48.748
It's called a memory box,

21:48.773 --> 21:51.365
and I put a lot of his
favorite little things

21:51.390 --> 21:53.416
and things that remind me of him,

21:53.418 --> 21:55.051
like, um...

21:55.053 --> 21:58.921
Oh, my gosh. Like this... menu.

21:58.923 --> 22:01.390
Oh, my dad used to take
me to this restaurant

22:01.392 --> 22:03.659
every time we went to visit
my grandparents in Jamaica.

22:03.661 --> 22:06.062
And he always got the oxtail

22:06.064 --> 22:07.964
- special.
- Beth.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.667
Girls, help Daddy unload
the groceries in the kitchen.

22:13.171 --> 22:15.343
Now, please. Thank you.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.578
What's going on?

22:23.054 --> 22:24.247
Memory box.

22:24.961 --> 22:26.449
I told Simon about doing one,

22:26.451 --> 22:28.684
and he recommended I try it with the girls,

22:28.686 --> 22:30.219
help 'em cope with their grief.

22:30.221 --> 22:31.754
There's nothing to grieve, Beth.

22:31.992 --> 22:33.456
- The man's alive.
- Randall,

22:33.458 --> 22:36.192
neither of us was prepared
when our father died.

22:36.194 --> 22:38.382
I-I want my babies to be ready.

22:38.461 --> 22:39.495
They deserve that.

22:39.497 --> 22:41.264
Will you please stop
saying things like "died"

22:41.266 --> 22:43.007
or "passing" or
"end-of-life"?

22:44.398 --> 22:45.711
Okay.

22:50.734 --> 22:52.174
Got your cool-guy shirt on?

22:52.176 --> 22:53.662
It's a little much for a chess tournament.

22:53.687 --> 22:54.877
I got to take a client out.

22:54.879 --> 22:56.546
Tonight? No.

22:56.548 --> 22:58.180
- No way.
- No, Beth, you don't understand.

22:58.182 --> 22:59.549
This guy Sanjay is kicking my ass.

22:59.551 --> 23:01.484
Yeah, and so is taking care of your father

23:01.486 --> 23:02.985
and our two freaked-out daughters.

23:02.987 --> 23:04.453
No. I call marriage tonight.

23:04.455 --> 23:05.821
I'm sorry, baby.

23:05.823 --> 23:07.323
- I need my teammate.
- Beth.

23:07.325 --> 23:08.445
Marriage.

23:13.289 --> 23:15.023
Please take off that shirt, honey.

23:15.796 --> 23:17.593
It wasn't cool on Sisqo in 2001.

23:17.618 --> 23:19.701
It's just... it's not cool
now. You know what I mean?

23:19.726 --> 23:20.790
- Mm.
- I love you.

23:20.815 --> 23:22.736
- I just don't like the shirt.
- I understand.

23:27.367 --> 23:30.656
We're just gonna start out
with some nice light stretching.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.681
Toby. What are you doing
here? I thought you'd left.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.526
What's that? No, I changed my
mind. I went and got a day pass.

23:39.528 --> 23:41.327
Went shopping, got some new threads.

23:41.329 --> 23:42.571
Check this out.

23:42.597 --> 23:43.922
- They light up!
- Mm.

23:43.947 --> 23:45.850
- Amazing?
- Let's get started, guys.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.000
I'm gonna go easy,

23:47.002 --> 23:48.553
'cause I got, like, a heart thing.

23:48.578 --> 23:49.936
Oh, yeah, for sure, take it easy.

23:49.938 --> 23:52.539
You are definitely full of surprises today.

23:52.541 --> 23:54.307
Just.. I...

23:54.309 --> 23:55.441
Oh.

23:55.443 --> 23:57.110
All right.

23:59.781 --> 24:00.980
Hey, Def Leppard.

24:04.382 --> 24:05.795
<i>Drumline?</i>

24:11.895 --> 24:13.562
Sorry for the delay, folks.

24:13.587 --> 24:15.437
We're having some technical difficulties.

24:35.476 --> 24:37.414
Switch seats with me, if you like?

24:38.689 --> 24:40.188
Thank you.

24:43.296 --> 24:44.496
May I?

24:54.117 --> 24:56.484
I can tell you're anxious,
'cause you're biting your nails,

24:56.509 --> 24:58.789
which is what you always
do when you're anxious.

25:00.046 --> 25:01.898
I also know you get claustrophobic

25:01.923 --> 25:03.773
when you're stuck in a place for too long,

25:03.798 --> 25:05.945
so I just wanted to come
over here and ease your mind,

25:05.947 --> 25:07.265
tell you that any second now,

25:07.899 --> 25:09.632
the train's gonna start moving, okay?

25:19.699 --> 25:20.992
How's Kate?

25:23.231 --> 25:25.578
Um, good.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.320
Good. Great, actually.

25:28.345 --> 25:29.843
She's great. She's engaged.

25:30.273 --> 25:31.820
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

25:31.845 --> 25:34.320
I know. Great guy, too. I really like him.

25:34.641 --> 25:35.765
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

25:35.790 --> 25:37.476
Yeah, it's good for her.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.773
What about Randall and Rebecca?

25:39.798 --> 25:40.898
Good, you know...

25:40.923 --> 25:42.882
- And Miguel?
- Okay, you know,

25:42.907 --> 25:44.429
just... you know, 'cause...

25:44.431 --> 25:46.319
Oh, you've always been so hard on him.

25:46.321 --> 25:47.887
Well, 'cause he... you know, obviously...

25:47.889 --> 25:49.589
Come on, how's my sweet
little Miggie doing?

25:49.591 --> 25:51.424
Don't do it. Oh...

25:51.426 --> 25:53.660
Just... I really hate it
when you call him that.

25:53.662 --> 25:54.814
I've always hated that.

25:54.839 --> 25:56.978
- I know.
- Oh, God.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.666
Sorry to hear about your mom's MS.

26:01.436 --> 26:02.892
It's tough, you know.

26:02.917 --> 26:04.353
How did you know about that?

26:05.872 --> 26:07.728
Oh, yeah, uh, well, it just...

26:08.046 --> 26:10.173
it turns out you and
I are Facebook friends.

26:10.211 --> 26:11.338
No, we're not.

26:13.017 --> 26:14.392
Except that we are.

26:14.417 --> 26:15.658
No, we're not.

26:15.683 --> 26:16.884
Uh...

26:16.909 --> 26:19.361
well, I'm-I'm Suehee Xiong.

26:19.654 --> 26:20.853
- What?
- That's me.

26:21.993 --> 26:23.080
N...

26:24.018 --> 26:26.085
Sorry. Yeah, no, I created a fake profile

26:26.087 --> 26:28.369
'cause I... wanted to keep up with you.

26:29.314 --> 26:30.523
You did not.

26:30.525 --> 26:31.595
I did, indeed.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.252
- You're Suehee?
- Yep.

26:34.189 --> 26:35.400
In the flesh.

26:42.871 --> 26:44.370
There you go.

26:45.607 --> 26:46.506
Sorry about that, folks.

26:46.508 --> 26:48.532
59th Street's next.

26:48.837 --> 26:50.276
Listen, uh, I just want you to know

26:50.278 --> 26:52.243
that I've changed, okay? Truly.

26:56.188 --> 26:57.450
You know, after we split up,

26:57.452 --> 26:59.642
I moved back in with my parents.

27:01.478 --> 27:04.626
I dated a bunch of jerks.

27:05.634 --> 27:07.524
I even married one of them.

27:08.789 --> 27:10.735
And surprise, surprise,
that didn't work out.

27:13.468 --> 27:15.118
I wasn't in a good place.

27:16.237 --> 27:17.517
For a long time.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.374
But I'm happy now.

27:21.618 --> 27:23.142
I like my job

27:23.144 --> 27:27.013
and I have an apartment with exposed brick.

27:27.962 --> 27:30.876
- You love exposed brick.
- I really do. Yeah.

27:32.453 --> 27:34.532
And I'm finally dating a nice guy.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.357
He's an X-ray technician, and he's...

27:39.259 --> 27:40.595
he's solid.

27:41.884 --> 27:43.329
59th Street.

27:45.418 --> 27:46.617
Whoa, hold on a second. Wait.

27:46.642 --> 27:48.711
No, Sophie. Hold on, give me a chance.

27:48.736 --> 27:50.603
Hold on, Sophie. Hold on a second, listen.

27:50.605 --> 27:52.505
If you're in love with this...
this X-ray technician guy,

27:52.507 --> 27:53.739
I don't want to ruin that for you, okay?

27:53.741 --> 27:55.708
I want you to be happy.

27:55.710 --> 27:57.276
But I...

27:57.278 --> 27:59.941
Do you remember what you wore
the first day of fourth grade?

28:01.883 --> 28:03.282
No, of course not.

28:03.684 --> 28:04.863
Overalls.

28:04.888 --> 28:07.353
You had on overalls, and
you had one of those, uh,

28:07.355 --> 28:08.821
those scrunchie things in your hair

28:08.823 --> 28:10.676
and you had a <i> Punky
Brewster</i> backpack.

28:15.629 --> 28:18.088
You walking into my fourth grade
class, Sophie, that's the best thing

28:18.113 --> 28:19.871
that ever happened to me in my entire life.

28:21.488 --> 28:23.346
Actually, scratch that, that's not true.

28:23.371 --> 28:25.518
It's the second best thing
that ever happened to me.

28:25.543 --> 28:27.207
The best thing that ever happened to me...

28:27.730 --> 28:29.926
was you telling me that you'd marry me.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.315
I'm still in love with you.

28:37.488 --> 28:39.354
And I will be at our restaurant

28:39.379 --> 28:42.074
bright and early tomorrow, I'll be
sitting in our booth, waiting for you.

29:04.738 --> 29:06.918
Oh, my God, this is endless.

29:07.293 --> 29:09.048
I kind of wish she didn't
make the final round

29:09.050 --> 29:10.434
so we could get out of here.

29:18.629 --> 29:20.000
Everything okay?

29:20.040 --> 29:21.406
Mm-hmm.

29:30.305 --> 29:31.937
It looks like we have
a checkmate, everybody.

29:31.939 --> 29:33.839
Congratulations, Tess.

29:33.841 --> 29:34.974
Yes, we do.

29:34.976 --> 29:36.876
Yes, we do.

29:36.878 --> 29:38.944
Right on.

29:38.946 --> 29:41.347
Oh, wow.

29:45.892 --> 29:47.320
Beth, I didn't make a mistake

29:47.322 --> 29:49.650
by bringing a dying man
into their lives, did I?

29:50.001 --> 29:51.672
It's not gonna break 'em, is it?

29:51.697 --> 29:53.156
No, you didn't make a mistake.

29:53.181 --> 29:55.273
Look, you brought them joy.

29:55.298 --> 29:56.728
It was a good thing.

29:56.978 --> 29:58.130
Hey, look at me.

29:58.736 --> 29:59.799
Are you okay?

30:00.618 --> 30:01.798
Yes.

30:03.462 --> 30:04.570
Okay.

30:05.298 --> 30:07.473
Come on, champion.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.154
Hi.

30:36.147 --> 30:37.232
What's going on?

30:37.257 --> 30:39.849
Well, I took the kids to their friends'

30:40.251 --> 30:41.740
for a sleepover and I'm
taking you somewhere.

30:41.765 --> 30:42.764
Where?

30:42.789 --> 30:44.615
- Where?
- Yeah.

30:53.529 --> 30:54.829
Somewhere.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.788
But if you want to find out,

30:57.790 --> 30:59.957
you are gonna have to
get in the car, right now.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.123
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:03.287 --> 31:04.365
Lead the way.

31:05.703 --> 31:08.193
- You really packed for me? Uh
-huh.

31:08.668 --> 31:11.949
All right. Yeah, pound. All right.

31:12.559 --> 31:14.152
Hey. Have a good one.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.144
I could get used to this.

31:16.332 --> 31:19.333
No, you couldn't, because you
are not supposed to be here.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.568
Whoa, whoa. What's up?

31:21.570 --> 31:23.604
Wha... I take this place seriously

31:23.606 --> 31:25.615
and you were acting like a total ass.

31:25.935 --> 31:27.365
Wow, okay.

31:28.216 --> 31:30.210
And here I was, thinking
I was just being myself.

31:30.212 --> 31:32.005
I was just trying to do
something nice for you.

31:32.052 --> 31:34.014
I didn't ask for you to do
anything nice for me, Toby.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.465
And I thought that you were leaving.

31:35.490 --> 31:37.150
- What happened?
- Would you ever think that maybe

31:37.152 --> 31:39.279
I needed you to do something nice for me?

31:41.576 --> 31:44.060
I was all alone in New York.

31:45.341 --> 31:48.595
Dr. Singh says that the, uh, incisions...

31:48.597 --> 31:50.664
from the not one, but two massive surgeries

31:50.666 --> 31:52.499
that I just had...
aren't healing as quickly

31:52.501 --> 31:54.052
as he expected them to.

31:54.803 --> 31:56.795
All right? Every morning I wake up,

31:56.904 --> 31:59.072
alone, my chest is so tight,

31:59.074 --> 32:00.941
that I think it's gonna happen again.

32:01.099 --> 32:02.743
- You know?
- I didn't know that.

32:02.745 --> 32:04.311
Yeah, I know. And that's fine.

32:07.822 --> 32:09.888
Look, you want to... you
want to be here, all right?

32:09.913 --> 32:11.810
And I want you to be here.

32:12.849 --> 32:15.455
And yeah, it hurt that you didn't
want to spend the day with me,

32:15.457 --> 32:16.823
and also I ran into your friend Duke,

32:16.825 --> 32:18.223
who's a real dick, by the way.

32:18.248 --> 32:19.192
Oh. He's not my friend.

32:19.194 --> 32:20.661
You know, and if I
hadn't had a heart attack

32:20.663 --> 32:22.763
four weeks ago, I'd have socked his nose.

32:22.765 --> 32:24.965
I'm sorry.

32:29.758 --> 32:31.371
Y-you just... you forgot to take this.

32:36.430 --> 32:37.938
Here.

32:41.914 --> 32:43.258
Here.

32:43.969 --> 32:45.319
It's my grandmother's ring.

32:45.321 --> 32:47.836
It was my last surprise.

32:48.355 --> 32:50.389
So, um... I'm gonna get
out of here, I won't cr...

32:50.414 --> 32:52.430
I won't cramp your style anymore.

33:11.058 --> 33:12.829
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:13.821 --> 33:15.983
Um, never did hear back
from you last night.

33:15.985 --> 33:17.962
Oh, well, went well.
Ken's signing it right now.

33:18.266 --> 33:20.516
Well, great. Let me go say hi.

33:20.704 --> 33:22.079
Hey, Randall.

33:22.243 --> 33:24.257
Let's, uh, let's talk in your office.

33:29.922 --> 33:32.258
- What's up?
- I want to...

33:32.508 --> 33:34.782
split your accounts between you and Sanjay.

33:36.705 --> 33:37.860
No.

33:38.674 --> 33:40.307
I-I brought all those accounts in.

33:40.309 --> 33:42.042
R-Randall, this isn't a
punishment. For ten years,

33:42.044 --> 33:43.243
you've been the first one in the morning

33:43.245 --> 33:44.978
and the last one out at night.

33:44.980 --> 33:47.247
You're invaluable, but
you need the support.

33:47.249 --> 33:48.982
You sure that's the reason?

33:48.984 --> 33:50.951
Look, Tyler, please. I'll bring my A game.

33:50.953 --> 33:52.452
I know I've been a little bit off lately...

33:52.454 --> 33:54.679
Randall. Randall, this is happening.

33:54.704 --> 33:56.741
You're still my top guy, but let's not...

33:57.526 --> 33:59.140
Don't make this something it's not.

34:04.436 --> 34:05.718
All right.

34:05.743 --> 34:06.844
Give me your hand.

34:06.869 --> 34:08.735
What are you up to?

34:08.737 --> 34:10.036
There's a... step right... there you go.

34:10.039 --> 34:11.405
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:11.407 --> 34:12.873
- Take a step forward with me.
- Okay.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.775
- Close this door.
- All right.

34:14.777 --> 34:15.842
Here, just grab on.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.010
- Jack.
- Yeah?

34:17.147 --> 34:18.975
- Where are we?
- Somewhere.

34:20.437 --> 34:22.248
- Can I take this thing off yet?
- No, no, no. Not yet, not yet.

34:22.273 --> 34:23.147
- Please?
- Almost.

34:23.172 --> 34:25.172
Almost, almost, almost. Okay. Step up.

34:26.722 --> 34:28.420
Okay. Come on.

34:28.994 --> 34:31.931
- Okay. I got you.
- Okay. I don't want to walk into walls.

34:31.975 --> 34:33.373
I got you... I would never...

34:33.376 --> 34:34.833
I would never put you in a wall.

34:36.246 --> 34:37.344
Can I please take this thing off?

34:37.424 --> 34:38.790
Oh, no, no. Not yet. Almost.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.166
Almost.

34:40.283 --> 34:41.449
Wait.

34:43.637 --> 34:45.338
Okay.

34:46.728 --> 34:47.846
There you go.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.252
Wait.

34:54.277 --> 34:55.502
Yeah.

34:57.971 --> 35:00.611
- Is this our first apartment?
- Yeah.

35:02.140 --> 35:03.072
Jack.

35:03.097 --> 35:05.986
It was vacant, so I rented
it out for the night.

35:06.011 --> 35:09.236
And I came in early, and
I... set up everything.

35:11.017 --> 35:11.932
Oh, babe.

35:12.019 --> 35:13.940
Bec,... I...

35:15.542 --> 35:17.877
I know we're not Shelly and Miguel.

35:18.651 --> 35:19.678
No.

35:19.994 --> 35:21.127
You're right.

35:21.152 --> 35:23.148
We need to take the time to remember

35:23.150 --> 35:24.449
the newlyweds that lived here.

35:24.611 --> 35:25.846
Mm-hmm.

35:26.086 --> 35:28.627
Yeah. 'Cause I miss them sometimes.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.353
I miss them, too.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.236
Jack...

35:51.596 --> 35:53.994
Somebody replaced the soap dish.

35:54.307 --> 35:55.680
Yeah.

35:58.611 --> 36:00.234
Do you want to see if we can...

36:00.675 --> 36:02.203
break it off again?

36:02.959 --> 36:03.965
Really?

36:03.990 --> 36:05.256
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:05.258 --> 36:06.891
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I do.

36:06.916 --> 36:09.308
- You do.
- Yeah. Mm.

36:26.630 --> 36:29.473
Hey, don't tell anybody the
help's in here burning calories.

36:31.613 --> 36:32.895
Leave me alone.

36:33.121 --> 36:34.246
Ooh.

36:34.645 --> 36:35.805
Lover's quarrel?

36:36.293 --> 36:37.683
Trouble in paradise?

36:38.012 --> 36:39.082
No.

36:41.579 --> 36:43.324
I'm not eating.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.582
I can see that.

36:48.024 --> 36:49.711
That's what the old me would do.

36:49.736 --> 36:52.313
Eat and self-sabotage,
and I'm not gonna do it.

36:52.338 --> 36:53.738
I'm just gonna sweat it out.

36:54.438 --> 36:55.641
Oh.

36:56.041 --> 36:57.438
I get it.

36:58.481 --> 37:00.516
I used to be like you.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.954
Thought I could will myself
to be a different kind of man.

37:04.851 --> 37:06.501
I tried to lose the weight,

37:07.104 --> 37:08.555
tried to get a job

37:08.580 --> 37:10.774
my parents could brag
to their friends about.

37:11.532 --> 37:13.633
I even tried to date the nice girl.

37:14.434 --> 37:15.790
Molly.

37:17.447 --> 37:18.954
I met the fiancÃ©.

37:20.658 --> 37:22.055
He's a good guy.

37:22.618 --> 37:24.219
I guess he's your Molly.

37:27.133 --> 37:29.688
Toby is not my "Molly."

37:32.514 --> 37:34.547
You want to know what I
finally figured out, Kate?

37:34.737 --> 37:36.103
What?

37:37.152 --> 37:39.930
It's a hell of a lot easier
to accept who you are,

37:41.121 --> 37:43.032
in all your damaged glory,

37:43.329 --> 37:45.610
than to try and be someone you're not.

37:47.506 --> 37:49.938
It sure is a hell of a lot more fun, too.

37:54.456 --> 37:56.219
And my offer still stands.

37:57.846 --> 37:59.094
Take it or leave it.

38:00.594 --> 38:02.211
I'm in Cabin 13.

38:15.942 --> 38:18.576
I do have one more surprise.

38:20.192 --> 38:23.108
I honestly don't know if I
can handle any more surprises.

38:23.403 --> 38:24.497
Indulge me.

38:25.364 --> 38:27.106
Okay.

38:38.513 --> 38:39.645
Our vows?

38:39.647 --> 38:40.950
Yeah.

38:43.950 --> 38:45.997
I wonder if they still hold up.

38:47.044 --> 38:48.154
Hmm.

38:50.709 --> 38:52.075
"Rebecca...

38:52.645 --> 38:56.862
saying I do means saying I will.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.411
I will love you today

39:00.161 --> 39:02.840
and every day for the rest of my life."

39:04.028 --> 39:05.504
- All right. What do you got?
- A queen.

39:05.506 --> 39:06.539
Nice.

39:06.541 --> 39:08.407
It's perfect. I love that.

39:08.409 --> 39:09.875
Okay. Put it in.

39:09.877 --> 39:11.010
I've been trying to focus

39:11.012 --> 39:13.446
on all of the little moments

39:13.448 --> 39:15.815
that... that I don't want to forget.

39:16.295 --> 39:17.416
<i>But the moment</i>

39:17.418 --> 39:20.717
<i>that's burned into
my brain and heart...</i>

39:24.474 --> 39:26.888
<i>...is the first time I saw you.</i>

39:31.920 --> 39:33.366
"Rebecca,

39:33.368 --> 39:37.263
you have changed the
way I think about love."

39:37.842 --> 39:38.838
Hmm.

39:42.076 --> 39:44.210
"I know things may not always be easy..."

39:44.212 --> 39:46.545
Ha. That should have been my red flag.

39:47.849 --> 39:49.015
Well, no take-backs now.

39:49.017 --> 39:50.182
- You're...
- Ugh.

39:50.184 --> 39:51.417
You're stuck with me.

39:53.287 --> 39:55.029
"But our love

39:55.723 --> 39:57.373
has always been worth it.

39:58.224 --> 40:01.627
I will encourage you,
trust and respect you.

40:02.115 --> 40:04.099
I will create a home with you,

40:05.201 --> 40:09.006
full of laughter and compassion.

40:10.115 --> 40:11.937
<i>I will raise a family with you,</i>

40:11.939 --> 40:15.037
<i>I will grow old with you,</i>

40:18.396 --> 40:20.529
<i>I will share my dreams with you."</i>

40:21.599 --> 40:24.917
So today, um...

40:24.919 --> 40:27.881
in front of, uh, everyone here,

40:29.357 --> 40:30.959
I pledge myself to you.

40:38.310 --> 40:39.443
"Jack,

40:40.635 --> 40:43.920
I fall a little bit more
in love with you every day.

40:45.935 --> 40:48.974
In you, I have found my soul mate,

40:50.011 --> 40:51.193
<i>my best friend,</i>

40:52.180 --> 40:53.467
<i>my lover,</i>

40:53.826 --> 40:55.607
<i>my partner,</i>

41:00.545 --> 41:02.029
<i>my safe place.</i>

41:04.201 --> 41:05.943
You are my great love story.

41:07.685 --> 41:10.482
And Jack Pearson...

41:10.932 --> 41:13.506
...our story is just getting started."

41:16.732 --> 41:18.076
Yeah.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.795
We're gonna be okay.

41:22.232 --> 41:23.631
I know.

41:27.765 --> 41:29.098
Mm.

41:35.209 --> 41:37.498
The band booked a five-state tour.

41:39.398 --> 41:41.023
And I think I want to go.
