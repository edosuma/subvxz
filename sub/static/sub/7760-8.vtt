YOU--YOU'VE BEEN DEPRESSED

03:41.021 --> 03:45.593
FOR PRACTICALLY
THE ENTIRE FIRST MONTH'S RENT.

I'M A LOUSY ROOMMATE.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.364
I'LL MOVE OUT

I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HIM.

03:57.771 --> 03:58.772
- YEAH.
- LAST NIGHT,

03:58.806 --> 04:00.574
I DREAMT ABOUT HIM AGAIN.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.742
HE SOMEHOW LEARNED
HOW TO LEVITATE

04:01.775 --> 04:03.511
AND WE WERE FUCKING,
MID-AIR.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.279
- I WONDER WHAT THAT MEANS.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.548
- PROBABLY THAT I
SHOULD SEE A SHRINK.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.418
- IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT THESE THINGS TAKE TIME,

04:10.451 --> 04:12.920
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT
TO SOMEHOW GET OVER HIM.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.422
MOVE ON.

04:14.455 --> 04:18.559
TELL YOURSELF
ETHAN'S HISTORY.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.761
- WHO'S TALKING ABOUT ETHAN?

04:20.794 --> 04:22.696
I'M TALKING ABOUT BRIAN.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.366
- BRIAN?

04:25.399 --> 04:27.635
- BUT I-I THOUGHT
YOU WERE OVER HIM.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.636
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.505
- I THOUGHT I WAS TOO.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.040
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU REALIZE

04:33.073 --> 04:35.376
YOU MADE THE BIGGEST
FUCKING MISTAKE

04:35.409 --> 04:37.378
OF YOUR PATHETIC,
STUPID LIFE?

04:37.411 --> 04:38.679
- BURY IT
IN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS

04:38.712 --> 04:40.814
AND FORGET ABOUT IT?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.550
- OBVIOUSLY,
THAT'S NOT WORKING.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.952
- WELL, THEN DEAL WITH IT.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.520
TELL HIM
YOU STILL LOVE HIM.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.656
- YEAH, RIGHT.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.923
HE'D FUCKING LAUGH
IN MY FACE.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.091
- WRITE HIM A LETTER.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.526
- HE'D TEAR IT UP.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.695
- I DON'T KNOW,
ATTEMPT SUICIDE?

04:54.728 --> 04:57.698
- [chuckles]
HE'D LET ME DIE.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.999
- OKAY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT I DID

04:59.032 --> 05:01.669
WHEN I WAS MADLY,
PASSIONATELY IN LOVE

05:01.702 --> 05:02.836
WITH BILLY HAUSER?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.405
- MADE AN IDIOT OF YOURSELF.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.540
- NO, NO.
[laughs]

05:06.574 --> 05:09.410
I SIGNED UP FOR EVERY CLASS

05:09.443 --> 05:11.078
I WENT TO--
I WENT TO SWIM PRACTICE.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.581
I GOT INVITED TO EVERY SINGLE
PARTY I KNEW HE'D BE AT.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.815
WHEREVER HE WENT,
THERE I WAS.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.785
HE COULDN'T AVOID ME.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.857
- WHOA, LOOK AT YOU.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.826
- WHAT? I PUT ON
THE WRONG THING, DIDN'T I?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.094
I SHOULD'VE WORN THE BURGUNDY,
SHOULDN'T I HAVE?

05:27.127 --> 05:28.496
I'M GOING TO PUT ON
THE BURGUNDY.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.732
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,

05:31.765 --> 05:35.503
I'D BUY A PAINTING FROM YOU

05:35.536 --> 05:36.970
- DID GUS EAT?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.839
- YEAH, ALL DONE.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.642
- A SPANISH OMELET WITH, UH,
LOTS OF PEPPERS AND ONIONS.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.877
- YOU DIDN'T!
- OF COURSE I DIDN'T.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.713
MOMMY MADE YOU
YOUR FAVORITE, HUH?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.715
OATMEAL AND RAISINS.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.383
- HE LOOKS A LITTLE FLUSHED.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.584
DOES HE LOOK FLUSHED TO YOU?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.119
- NO, HE DOES NOT
LOOK FLUSHED.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.654
NOW YOU BETTER
GET A MOVE ON.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.722
I'M GOING TO DROP HIM OFF
AT DAYCARE

05:54.755 --> 05:55.989
ON THE WAY TO MY OFFICE.

- OH, I CAN'T HELP IT.
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM

06:09.837 --> 06:12.005
PRACTICALLY EVERY MOMENT
SINCE HE'S BEEN BORN.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.907
- WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO LET HIM GO

06:13.941 --> 06:15.476
WHEN HE TURNS 18 ANYWAY,
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL

06:15.509 --> 06:16.677
START GETTING USED TO IT.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.045
I MEAN, COME ON.
YOU WANTED THIS JOB.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.481
- I KNOW, I'M JUST
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.484
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.918
YOU'RE INTELLIGENT.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.620
YOU'RE ACCOMPLISHED.

IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU COME,

07:16.970 --> 07:18.706
I'M AMAZED YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN EVICTED.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.974

TO HAVE TO MOVE ANYWAY.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.743
- YUP,
YOUR FRIEND STOCKWELL

AND NOW THEY'RE RIGHT UNDER
OUR BEDROOM WINDOW.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.616
- SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT CITY LIVING,

07:28.649 --> 07:30.150
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T BEAT IT
FOR THE CONVENIENCE.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.486
- SOME OF THEM LOOK 14.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.021
TOO YOUNG EVEN FOR YOU.
- [chuckles]

07:34.054 --> 07:36.023
- I CANNOT STOP THINKING
ABOUT THIS ONE KID.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.691
HE SAID FOR 200 BUCKS

07:37.725 --> 07:39.259
THAT I COULD FUCK HIM
WITHOUT A CONDOM.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.094
- YOU SHOULD HAVE.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.697
AT LEAST HE'D HAVE ENOUGH
FOR HIS PROTEASE INHIBITORS.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.499
- WAIT, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
TED!

07:45.533 --> 07:46.900
- CHRIST.
DOES HE HAVE TO ANNOUNCE IT?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.570
- TED, WE HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN WEEKS.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.039
- COULDN'T WAIT TO GET HERE.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT TOOK.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.643
- HEY.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.911

TO YOU, THEODORE.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.580
YOU KNOW, MOST GUYS
WHO HAD JUST LOST EVERYTHING

07:59.613 --> 08:01.849
AND BEEN HUMILIATED
IN ALL THE MAJOR MEDIA

08:01.882 --> 08:03.183
WOULD HAVE TOO MUCH
SELF-RESPECT THAN

08:03.216 --> 08:06.053
TO SHOW THEIR FACE IN PUBLIC,
BUT NOT YOU.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.189
- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO SAY
"THANK YOU" OR "FUCK YOU."

08:09.222 --> 08:10.924
- PEOPLE FORGET
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.259
BY NOW THEY'RE ON
TO THE NEXT HEADLINE.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.862
- YEAH,
"FORMER PORN KING HOMELESS."

08:14.895 --> 08:17.598
- NO, YOU WILL BE BACK ON
YOUR FEET BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.867
- I BETTER BE, MY MORTGAGE
ISN'T GOING TO PAY FOR ITSELF.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.301
- IT WON'T HAVE TO.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.538
I HAVE DECIDED
TO GET A SECOND JOB.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.139
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
NO, I-I GOT MYSELF

08:26.173 --> 08:27.875
INTO THIS MESS,
I'LL GET MYSELF OUT.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.644
- THAT IS VERY NOBLE,
BUT WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.280
NOW I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.148
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.750
- HEY, COME ON, LET'S, UH--
LET'S GET CHANGED

08:36.784 --> 08:39.086
AND HIT THE STAIRMASTER.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.754
- AND WORK UP A SWEAT.
- YEAH, RELEASE THOSE

08:40.788 --> 08:43.290
ENDORPHINS,
BURN OFF SOME LACTIC ACID.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.825
COME ON, COME ON!
- YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.760
EXERCISE IS PROBABLY
JUST WHAT I NEED.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.662
[joints pop]

08:49.830 --> 08:51.164
[grunts]

08:51.198 --> 08:53.834
- TEDDY, TEDDY, WHAT IS IT?
- [grunts]

08:53.867 --> 08:55.302
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- MM-MM.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.170
- IS IT--
- TED?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.772
- DID YOU TURN YOUR--
- NO.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.608
- IS IT THE THING WHERE THE--
- NO. [grunts]

09:00.641 --> 09:03.076
- CONSTANCE DALYEAU
WAS A PROSTITUTE

09:03.110 --> 09:04.344
TOULOUSE LAUTREC DISCOVERED

09:04.377 --> 09:07.214
AT ONE OF THE BROTHELS
HE FREQUENTED.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.783
THE LEGEND GOES THAT
WHEN HE WENT TO HER ROOM,

09:09.817 --> 09:13.220
SHE WAS NAKED AND PAINTING.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.955
INSTEAD OF MAKING L'AMOUR,

09:14.988 --> 09:17.357
HE INSISTED THAT
SHE FINISH HER CANVAS.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.928
HE THEN INTRODUCED HER WORK
INTO THE SALONS OF PARIS,

09:20.961 --> 09:23.063
MUCH TO THE HORROR
OF THE CRITICS.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.364
- HM.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.235
- SHE'S RELATIVELY UNKNOWN
TODAY.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.604
BUT IF SHE HAD BEEN A MAN,
YOU CAN BE SURE

09:30.638 --> 09:32.940
SHE'D BE AS RENOWNED
AS DEGAS OR MANET.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.708
- WHAT A REMARKABLE STORY.
- MM-HMM.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.143
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.945
- I USED TO TEACH
ART HISTORY,

09:37.978 --> 09:40.814
AND I'M ALSO
A PAINTER MYSELF.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.817
- AH, WELL, YOU'VE SOLD ME.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.686
- WONDERFUL.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.220
WELL, WE'LL WRITE UP THE ORDER
AND HAVE IT DELIVERED

09:47.254 --> 09:49.957
TO YOU JUST AS SOON
AS THE SHOW IS OVER.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.825
[exhales]
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

09:51.859 --> 09:55.128
- THE PLEASURE
IS ENTIRELY MINE.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.098
- OH, ALFRED.
- HELLO, SIDNEY.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.100
THANKS TO THIS CHARMING
YOUNG WOMAN,

10:00.133 --> 10:02.135
I NOW OWN A DALYEAU.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.739
- A SPLENDID CHOICE.
- HM.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.910
- WHAT A NICE MAN.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.278
- HE'S BEEN COMING
TO THE GALLERY

10:11.311 --> 10:15.716
FOR OVER TEN YEARS--

10:15.749 --> 10:17.918
NEVER BOUGHT A THING.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.386
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

10:19.419 --> 10:23.256
- IT--IT WAS EASY.
I LOVE ART AND I LOVE PEOPLE.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.426
- HMM.
DO YOU ALSO LOVE PARTIES?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.062
- OH, I ADORE PARTIES.
[chuckles]

10:29.096 --> 10:32.065
- GOOD.

10:32.099 --> 10:35.335
THEN YOU CAN DEAL
WITH FLORINDA ZECKENDORFF,

10:35.368 --> 10:37.204
FORMERLY HITLER'S MISTRESS,

10:37.237 --> 10:39.339
CURRENTLY PLANNING
OUR OPENING.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.874
SHE'LL BE STORMING
IN HERE TOMORROW

10:40.908 --> 10:43.343
TO DISCUSS
THE FINAL DETAILS.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.945
- SOUNDS LIKE A HANDFUL.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.080
- OH, SHE REMINDS ME
OF MY EX-WIFE.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.750
I BREAK OUT IN HIVES IF I STAND
WITHIN TWO FEET OF HER.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.085
- PERHAPS I NEED
A BIT MORE EXPERIENCE

10:52.119 --> 10:55.288
IN ORDER TO, UH, TAKE ON
SUCH A FORMIDABLE TASK.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.424
- I'M SURE IF ANYONE
CAN WITHSTAND

10:57.457 --> 11:01.061
THE ASSAULT OF A PANZER DIVISION
SINGLE-HANDED,

11:01.094 --> 11:02.029
IT'S YOU.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.798
ENJOY.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.338
- NICE WORK ON THE STOCKWELL
CAMPAIGN, BARB.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.773
- OH, THANK YOU, MR. KINNEY.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.441
- BUT, UH, LIGHTEN UP
ON THE AIRBRUSH.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.309
YOU'RE MAKING HIM
LOOK YOUNGER THAN ME.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.946
- OKAY.

11:18.979 --> 11:22.049
- MURPH?

11:22.082 --> 11:24.451
WHERE THE FUCK'S THE LAYOUT
FOR MIGHTY MINTS?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.319
- OH, I KNOW, I PROMISED THAT
TO YOU THIS MORNING.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.355
- ANY WAY I CAN HELP
SPEED THINGS UP?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.090
SALARY CUT?
PINK SLIP?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.825
- [chuckles]
YOU'LL HAVE IT BY NOON.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.961
AND STARTING TODAY, THINGS
SHOULD GO A LITTLE FASTER.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.228
WE'RE HIRING
A NEW STUDENT INTERN TO

11:35.262 --> 11:37.064
HELP WITH THE BUSY WORK.
OH, BRIAN.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.399
THIS IS JUSTIN TAYLOR,
OUR NEW INTERN.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.934
JUSTIN, THIS IS MR. KINNEY,

11:40.968 --> 11:42.803
ONE OF THE PARTNERS
IN THE AGENCY.

11:42.836 --> 11:47.474
- NICE TO MEET YOU,
MR. KINNEY.

11:47.507 --> 11:50.744
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.479
- WHEN?

11:52.512 --> 11:54.214
- AFTER I GOT THE JOB.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.516
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE THE JOB
UNTIL I SIGN OFF.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.852
AND I DON'T SIGN OFF
UNTIL I ASK

11:58.886 --> 12:02.222
THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATE
A FEW QUESTIONS, SUCH AS,

12:02.255 --> 12:05.292
"WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?"

12:07.560 --> 12:09.362
- AS PART OF OUR
DEGREE CANDIDACY,

12:09.396 --> 12:11.098
WE'RE REQUIRED TO GET
THREE CREDITS

12:11.131 --> 12:13.834
OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE
IN OUR CHOSEN FIELD.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.302
SO I WROTE A LETTER

12:15.335 --> 12:16.970
TO THE HEAD OF YOUR
ART DEPARTMENT

12:17.004 --> 12:19.973
SAYING I WANTED TO INTERN,
SUBMITTED MY TRANSCRIPT,

12:20.007 --> 12:21.842
SAMPLES OF MY WORK,
AND HERE I AM.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.779
- HERE YOU AREN'T.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.982
THERE ARE OTHER AGENCIES
WHERE I DON'T WORK.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.118
- THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.519
VANGARD'S THE BEST.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.321
WORKING HERE WILL LOOK GREAT
ON MY RESUME.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.389
I'LL MAKE IMPORTANT CONTACTS.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.891
I'LL LEARN THINGS
THAT I WOULDN'T LEARN

12:37.925 --> 12:39.059
IN THE CLASSROOM.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.527
- LEARN THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.996
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.565
I WAS ACCEPTED BASED SOLELY
ON MY MERIT.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.901
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.269
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PLEASED.

12:49.302 --> 12:53.006
- [chuckles]
TO SEE YOUR FACE EVERY DAY?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.808
- I HAD NO IDEA THAT
OUR FORMER RELATIONSHIP

12:54.842 --> 12:57.144
WAS STILL A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.812
- WHO SAID IT WAS A PROBLEM?

12:58.846 --> 13:02.415
AND WHO SAID THAT WE WERE EVER
IN A RELATIONSHIP?

13:02.449 --> 13:04.417
WELL, THEN I CAN SEE NO REASON
THAT YOU WOULD OBJECT

13:04.451 --> 13:06.486
TO MY COMPLETING
MY EDUCATION

13:06.519 --> 13:09.456
THAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR.

13:13.961 --> 13:18.065
- WELL, JUST DON'T EXPECT
ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT.

13:18.098 --> 13:21.434
- I NEVER HAVE.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.036
- HERE, HONEY.
YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN AND EAT

13:23.070 --> 13:24.371
LIKE A CIVILIZED
HUMAN BEING?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.339
- UH-UH.
I GOT TO GO TO THE FRAMERS,

13:26.373 --> 13:29.576
THEN TO THE PRINTERS,
THEN TO THE BANK. UGH.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.512
THIS JOB MAKES TAKING CARE
OF GUS LOOK LIKE CHILD'S PLAY.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.047
[both chuckle]

13:34.081 --> 13:36.083
- THAT'S IT,
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.584
- [groans]

13:37.617 --> 13:40.053
- JESUS CHRIST.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

13:40.087 --> 13:41.922
- HE INJURED HIS BACK
AT THE GYM.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.224
- [grunts]
- OOH, THAT COULD BE SERIOUS.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.059
A FRIEND OF MINE
SLIPPED A DISC AND HAS BEEN

13:46.093 --> 13:49.062
IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN
EVER SINCE.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.931
- WONDERFUL!

13:50.964 --> 13:52.499
- OKAY, LET'S SIT DOWN.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.634
THAT'S IT, SLOWLY.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.071
- [grunting]

13:58.105 --> 14:00.140
- DOES IT HURT, HONEY?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.643
- THERE YOU ARE.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.980
NOW, LET'S, UH--
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LUNCH,

14:07.014 --> 14:11.251
STARTING WITH
A VICACET APPETIZER.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.652
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN DRUGS.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.487
I'LL TAKE MY PAIN
STRAIGHT UP.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.557
- SHAME YOU CAN'T
STAND THAT WAY.

14:17.590 --> 14:21.094
- WOULD YOU BRING ME A SCOOP
OF BUTTER PECAN, DEBBIE?

14:21.128 --> 14:22.963
WHENEVER WE WANTED, UH,
OUR DOG FETCH

14:22.996 --> 14:25.966
TO TAKE A PILL, WE'D ALWAYS
HIDE IT IN THE ICE CREAM.

14:25.999 --> 14:30.037
- GOT IT.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.372
- DO YOU REALLY THINK I COULDN'T
HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.507
- FETCH HEARD EVERYTHING
WE SAID TOO,

14:34.541 --> 14:38.111
BUT HE COULDN'T RESIST
THE BUTTER PECAN.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.546
- I HAVE TO RUN, YOU GUYS.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.981
THERE'S A NEW SHOW
AT THE GALLERY.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.649
MR. BLOOM PUT ME IN CHARGE.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.552
I EVEN HAVE TO MEET WITH
THIS PARTY PLANNER TOMORROW.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.521
- PARTY? DID SOMEONE SAY PARTY?
[chuckles]

14:48.555 --> 14:51.691
LINZ, UM,
YOU KNOW I WOULD,

14:51.724 --> 14:53.660
NEVER ASK A FRIEND
FOR A FAVOR.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.395
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S MANIPULATIVE,
IT'S UNFAIR,

14:55.428 --> 14:56.997
IT'S DOWNRIGHT BAD MANNERS.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.166
HOWEVER, UM, DO YOU THINK

14:59.199 --> 15:01.368
YOU MIGHT NEED A WAITER?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.536
VALET?
HATCHECK GIRL?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.039
- WELL, I--
- IT--IT'S JUST, UM...

15:06.073 --> 15:07.540
- [grunts]
- EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

15:07.574 --> 15:11.578
WE COULD REALLY
USE THE CASH.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.013
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.415
- THANKS.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.917
both: BYE.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.722
- OOH, UH, WOULD YOU
HAND ME A MENU, SWEETIE?

15:22.755 --> 15:28.295

15:28.328 --> 15:29.462
ALL RIGHT, TO HELL

16:06.166 --> 16:08.201

16:10.270 --> 16:13.673
* DO THIS AND THAT
IT'S ALL YOU KNOW *

16:13.706 --> 16:17.110

JUSTIN TAYLOR.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.488

16:28.521 --> 16:31.791
- FANCY THAT.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.260
WHERE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND?

16:33.293 --> 16:36.796
- I DON'T DO BOYFRIENDS.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.132
- SINCE WHEN?
- SINCE WE BROKE UP.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.667
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LOVE
THAT WAS GOING TO LAST

16:40.700 --> 16:43.670
FOR AN ETERNITY?

16:43.703 --> 16:46.806
- ETERNITIES AREN'T AS LONG
AS THEY USED TO BE.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.442
BUY YOU A DRINK?
- MM.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.245
- MM. OH,
I LOVE THIS SONG.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.680
DO YOU LIKE THIS SONG?

16:53.713 --> 16:56.116
- IT FILLS THE VOID.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.650
- I HAVEN'T DANCED
IN FOREVER.

16:57.684 --> 17:02.255
- KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.157
- NO RUSH.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.393
I'VE GOT ALL NIGHT.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.295

17:08.328 --> 17:10.130
- SO DO YOU.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.331
- YEAH,
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.799
I DON'T HAVE
TO IMPRESS MY BOSS

17:12.832 --> 17:17.270
SO HE DOESN'T FIRE MY ASS.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.406
THANKS FOR THE DRINK.

ICE TINA.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.748
SHE'S THIS EVIL DRAG QUEEN

17:28.781 --> 17:31.551
WHO FREEZES RAGE
WITH THIS DIRTY LOOK.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.820
AND JUST WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE
RAGE IS GOING TO SPEND

17:33.853 --> 17:35.622
THE REST OF HIS DAYS
AS A FROZEN TV DINNER,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.857
J.T. DEFROSTS HIM

17:37.890 --> 17:40.560
WITH THE WORLD'S

17:47.334 --> 17:48.868
- WELL, NO WONDER
YOU WEREN'T ANSWERING ME.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.703
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST PREOCCUPIED.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.305
- NO, NO.
FORGOT TO TAKE THESE EARPLUGS

17:52.339 --> 17:55.208

- YEAH, AND PESKY BOYFRIENDS
WHO WON'T SHUT UP.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.482
- OH. MM-KAY.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.619
YOU CAN REPEAT IT TO ME
ON THE WAY TO THE BUS STOP.

18:06.653 --> 18:11.524
I PROMISE TO GIVE YOU
MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.427
- CHRIST.
IS--IS HE DEAD?

18:18.498 --> 18:19.732
- NO, NO.
HE'S SLEEPING.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.502
- WAKE HIM UP,
TELL HIM TO MOVE.

18:22.535 --> 18:27.340
- HELLO? HELLO?

18:27.374 --> 18:28.341
- HEY.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.742
- HUH. WHAT?
- WHOA.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.212
OH, JEEZ.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.514
YOU'RE THAT KID--
KID FROM THE OTHER NIGHT,

18:34.547 --> 18:37.717
THE ONE WITH
THE "CONDOMS OPTIONAL" POLICY.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.255
- OFFER STILL STANDS.
- [scoffs]

18:42.289 --> 18:44.424
- I ALSO GIVE TWO-FOR-ONE
DISCOUNTS.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.758
- WHAT ARE YOU, THE Q-MART?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.494
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.761
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
SLEEPING

18:48.795 --> 18:50.897
IN FRONT OF MY DOOR,
SO GET LOST.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.566
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AROUND
HERE AGAIN, YOU UNDERSTAND?

18:53.600 --> 18:57.270
- YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
FUCK YOU TOO.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.439
- HEY, KID--
- YEAH, "DON'T COME BACK,"

18:59.472 --> 19:01.808
I GOT IT.
- NO, I WAS GOING TO ASK, UM--

19:01.841 --> 19:04.811
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU ATE?

19:09.682 --> 19:12.819
- BEEN A WHILE SINCE
YOU EATEN, HUH?

19:14.587 --> 19:16.656
MYSELF, I LOVE TO COOK.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.559
IT'S THE ITALIAN IN ME.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.927
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

19:20.960 --> 19:25.398
SHE LIKE TO COOK?

19:25.432 --> 19:27.667
BET SHE MISSES YOU.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.403
ME, I GO A DAY WITHOUT
SEEING MY MICHAEL, I'M A WRECK.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.938
RIGHT, BABY?
- MOM, DON'T.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.606
- HE RAN AWAY ONCE
WHEN HE WAS TEN.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.208
I WAS WORRIED OUT OF MY MIND.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.476
IT'S A ROTTEN THING TO DO
TO YOUR MOTHER.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.710
- YOU EMBARRASSED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME

19:37.744 --> 19:39.446
BY SHOWING UP
AT THE LITTLE LEAGUE

19:39.479 --> 19:40.613
IN THAT COACH'S UNIFORM
YOU BOUGHT AT THE GOODWILL.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.282
- I FELT BAD.

19:42.315 --> 19:45.218
HE WAS THE ONLY KID ON HIS TEAM
WITHOUT A FATHER.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.688
- SOME KIDS HAVE ALL THE LUCK.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.758
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND YOUR DAD
AREN'T TOO CLOSE.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.560
- HE'S DEAD.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.994
- WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

19:55.027 --> 19:59.432
- IN JAIL, FOR KILLING HIM.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.833
- WELL, THERE MUST BE SOMEPLACE
YOU COULD GO,

20:00.867 --> 20:02.435
A NICE FOSTER FAMILY.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.637
- YEAH, IT'S BETTER
THAN THE STREETS.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.639
- YEAH?

20:06.673 --> 20:09.242
AT LEAST MY CLIENTS
PAY TO FUCK ME.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.344
- HEY. HEY,
WATCH THE LANGUAGE.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.380
THAT'S MY MOM
YOU'RE TALKING TO.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.714
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT

20:14.747 --> 20:16.449
THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER
YOUTH SHELTER?

20:16.483 --> 20:18.751
- YEAH, THEY EVEN GOT
A BACK-TO-SCHOOL PROGRAM.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.988
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- RIGHT ON.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.957
I'LL BE SURE
TO CHECK THAT OUT.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.534
- HEY, BRIAN.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.472
- IT'S MR. KINNEY.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.041
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.911
- THEY'RE OUT TO LUNCH.
- HM.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.813
WELL, THAT'S GOOD THAT
SOME PEOPLE CAN AFFORD

20:46.846 --> 20:48.915
THE LUXURY TO EAT
WHEN EYE-CONIC OPTICS

20:48.948 --> 20:51.017
WILL BE HERE IN TWO HOURS
AND THESE BOARDS ARE FOR SHIT.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.285
- CAN I HELP?

20:52.319 --> 20:54.287
- CAN YOU HELP?

20:54.321 --> 20:57.624
UM, YEAH, YOU CAN TELL THEM
I WANT ONE CELL PER BOARD,

20:57.657 --> 21:02.061
20-BY-30, IN BLACK FOAM CORE,
AND, UH,

21:02.094 --> 21:05.031
CENTURY FONT IN 16--

21:05.064 --> 21:07.967
NO, MAKE THAT 20.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.440
YOU WANT TO WRITE THAT DOWN?

21:13.473 --> 21:16.643
- ONE CELL PER BOARD, 20-BY-30,
BLACK FOAM CORE,

21:16.676 --> 21:18.778
CENTURY FONT IN 16--

21:18.811 --> 21:22.415
NO, MAKE THAT 20.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.384
- [scoffs]

21:24.417 --> 21:25.818
SO HOW'S IT GOING, TAYLOR?

21:25.852 --> 21:28.054
- GOOD.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.689
EVERYONE'S INCREDIBLY NICE,

21:29.722 --> 21:30.923
AND I'VE ALREADY LEARNED
MORE THAN I WOULD

21:30.957 --> 21:32.792
IN AN ENTIRE SEMESTER
OF SCHOOL.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.927
- THAT'S GREAT.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.430
- WHICH SAYS A LOT ABOUT YOU,
ACTUALLY.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.798
- ABOUT ME?

21:38.831 --> 21:40.567
- YEAH, THEY SAY THE TONE
OF THE WORKPLACE

21:40.600 --> 21:42.669
IS ESTABLISHED
FROM THE TOP.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.871
SO IT'S A GREAT COMPLIMENT
TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE

21:44.904 --> 21:47.974
SUCH A DEDICATED
AND HARDWORKING STAFF.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.080
- WELL, MAYBE
I WAS A LITTLE HARD ON YOU.

21:54.113 --> 21:58.585
NOW GET BACK TO WORK.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.621
- YES, MR. KINNEY.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.891
- NOW, WE'LL HAVE
THE BAR THERE,

22:04.924 --> 22:06.426
THE BUFFET THERE,

22:06.459 --> 22:07.994
AND THE DESSERT TABLE THERE.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.430
- EXCUSE ME.
- YES, DEAR?

22:10.463 --> 22:11.864
- WELL, WOULDN'T IT BE NICER
TO HAVE WAITERS

22:11.898 --> 22:13.966
CIRCULATING AMONG THE GUESTS
WITH TRAYS OF FOOD?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.768
THAT WAY EVERYONE
CAN ENJOY THE SHOW.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.838
- IT'S JUST EASIER
TO LET THEM SERVE THEMSELVES.

22:18.871 --> 22:22.509
BESIDES, SIDNEY APPRECIATES
KEEPING THE COST DOWN.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.777
NOW, FOR THE MENU,
WE'LL HAVE THE USUAL,

22:24.811 --> 22:27.046
MINI-QUICHES,
FINGER SANDWICHES.

22:27.079 --> 22:30.517
- MINI-QUICHES?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.652
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG,
DEAR?

22:32.685 --> 22:36.456
- WELL, I WAS HOPING
FOR SOMETHING A BIT MORE...

22:36.489 --> 22:39.392
IMAGINATIVE.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.060
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT NICE GIRL

22:41.093 --> 22:42.662
WHO USED TO WORK HERE?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.997
- OH, THAT GIRL WAS 65.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.734
SHE RETIRED.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.737
- WELL, I'VE NEVER HAD
ANY COMPLAINTS BEFORE.

22:50.770 --> 22:55.074
PERHAPS I'D BETTER GO OVER
THESE DETAILS WITH SIDNEY.

22:55.107 --> 22:58.144
- MR. BLOOM PLACED ME
IN CHARGE.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.179
- WELL, THEN PERMIT ME
TO INFORM YOU

23:00.212 --> 23:04.484
THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING
THESE EVENTS FOR OVER 15 YEARS.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.486
- MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.888
- OH, AND WHAT
WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

23:08.921 --> 23:11.524
- SOMETHING SPECIAL,
UNIQUE,

23:11.558 --> 23:13.793
THAT REFLECTS THE THEME
OF THE EVENING.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.062
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
FOR INSTANCE,

23:16.095 --> 23:19.432
COOKIES WITH MINI
IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.834
- IMPRESSIONIST COOKIES.
OOH!

23:21.868 --> 23:24.103
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL SIDNEY.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.772
AND WHILE I'M AT IT,
I'LL TELL HIM

23:25.805 --> 23:27.106
THAT HIS OFFICE GIRL SHOULD

23:27.139 --> 23:29.108
BE ANSWERING PHONES
AND TAKING MESSAGES,

23:29.141 --> 23:31.511
NOT INTERFERING
WITH THE WORK

23:31.544 --> 23:33.513
OF HIGHLY RESPECTED
PROFESSIONALS.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.047
- OH, YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER
TELLING HIM ANYTHING,

23:35.081 --> 23:37.717
MS. ZECKENDORFF BECAUSE...

23:37.750 --> 23:39.051
YOU'RE FIRED.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.854
- [scoffs]
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.690
I'VE KNOWN SIDNEY
FOR YEARS.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.825
HIS EX-WIFE
AND I ARE LIKE THIS.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.594
- YES, HE TOLD ME.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.929
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
DEAR,

23:49.962 --> 23:52.832
I HAVE TO GO HANG A MONET.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.670
- TO INTRODUCE
EYE-CONIC OPTICS' NEW LINE

23:57.704 --> 23:59.806
OF EYE CANDY, WE DECIDED
TO GIVE THE BUYER

23:59.839 --> 24:02.208
SOMETHING TO REALLY LOOK AT.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.076
- A DELIGHT TO THE EYES.

24:04.110 --> 24:09.081
A FEAST FOR THE SENSES.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.851
AN EYE-POPPING ARRAY
OF COLORS AND IMAGES

24:11.884 --> 24:13.553
TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE
THAT WHEN YOU WEAR

24:13.586 --> 24:15.622
EYE-CONIC OPTICS' EYE CANDY,

24:15.655 --> 24:17.990
YOU SEE THINGS
YOU DON'T WITHOUT THEM.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.826
- UNLESS YOU HAPPEN
TO BE A VOYEUR.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.194
- [chuckles]

24:28.034 --> 24:29.969
- WOULD YOU BUY A PAIR
OF THESE SUNGLASSES

24:30.002 --> 24:32.739
IF YOU SAW THIS AD?

24:32.772 --> 24:35.742
- OH, SURE.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.578
- HMM.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.713
I DON'T LIKE THE LETTERING.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.649
- THE FONT CAN ALWAYS
BE CHANGED.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.852
- UH, IT'S NOT THE FONT,
IT'S THE COLOR.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.588
- OUR ART DEPARTMENT
RESEARCHED IT.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.190
IT'S WHAT THE FOCUS GROUPS
MOST RESPONDED TO.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.159
- WELL, THEY MAY BE RESPONDING
TO IT TODAY,

24:53.192 --> 24:56.596
BUT WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW,
IN SIX MONTHS?

24:56.629 --> 24:58.765
- YOU'LL BE AHEAD OF THE WAVE,
NOT RIDING IT.

24:58.798 --> 25:02.669
- ORANGE.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.871
- WHAT WAS THAT?

25:04.904 --> 25:06.606
- NOTHING.
- NO, NO, NO.

25:06.639 --> 25:09.876
YOU SAID ORANGE.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.279
- EVERYONE AT ART SCHOOL
SAYS ORANGE IS THE NEW BLUE.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.548
IT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF COOL TONES.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.883
IT'S SOMETHING HOT.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.151
- HMM.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.687
I WANT ORANGE.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.222
- THEN ORANGE IT'LL BE.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.291
RIGHT, BRIAN?

25:25.324 --> 25:26.693
- YOU GUYS HAD
BETTER BE CAREFUL,

25:26.726 --> 25:29.662
OR THIS KID'LL
HAVE YOUR JOB.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.033
- YOU REALLY DON'T MIND
WATCHING SPIDER-MAN AGAIN?

25:34.066 --> 25:35.668
- NO, NO, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.970
WE'VE ONLY WATCHED IT
NINE TIMES.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.172
- YOU PIECE OF SHIT
MOTHERFUCKER!

25:40.206 --> 25:41.774
TEACH YOU TO STEAL MY TRICK.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.643
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

25:43.676 --> 25:45.578
- BEN, DON'T.
IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS!

25:45.612 --> 25:46.679
- I'LL TEACH YOU
TO STEAL MY TRICK!

25:46.713 --> 25:47.914
- HEY, YOU PUNKS
WANT TO FIGHT?

25:47.947 --> 25:49.782
- PLEASE, BE CAREFUL!

25:49.816 --> 25:52.184
- YOU FIGHT ME, OTHERWISE
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

25:52.218 --> 25:54.721
- WE'LL BE BACK, BASTARD!

25:54.754 --> 25:57.724
[overlapping shouting]

25:57.757 --> 25:59.992
- [grunts]

26:04.864 --> 26:07.767
WHO DIED AND MADE YOU
SUPERMAN?

26:09.368 --> 26:11.804
[coughs]

26:11.838 --> 26:13.740
- SHE WAS SO CONDESCENDING.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.075
"YES, DEAR.
WHAT, DEAR?"

26:16.108 --> 26:18.244
IF SHE CALLED ME "DEAR" ONE
MORE TIME, I'D HAVE CLOCKED HER.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.612
- [chuckles]

26:19.646 --> 26:21.347
AS YOUR WIFE
AND YOUR ATTORNEY,

26:21.380 --> 26:22.949
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.251
- SO INSTEAD, I FIRED HER.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.886
- NO.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.356
- YUP, I FIRED SOMEONE.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.091
ME!

26:32.124 --> 26:34.393
- OH, SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
EVERY REASON TO NAIL THE BITCH.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.962
WHAT'D YOUR BOSS SAY?

26:35.995 --> 26:37.296
- OH, HE OFFERED
TO GIVE ME A RAISE.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.765
SAID HE'S WANTED
TO CAN HER FOR YEARS,

26:38.798 --> 26:40.099
BUT JUST
DIDN'T HAVE THE NERVE.

26:40.132 --> 26:43.369
- OH, THERE YOU GO!

26:43.402 --> 26:46.038
- EXCEPT THERE'S
STILL A PARTY TO GIVE

26:46.072 --> 26:48.274
IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS,
AND NO PARTY PLANNER TO GIVE IT.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.742
I'VE TRIED EVERYONE.
I DON'T KNOW

26:49.776 --> 26:52.044
WHAT THE HELL
I'M GOING TO DO.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.714
[sighs, mumbles]

26:54.747 --> 26:56.382
- THERE'S THESE TWO WOMEN
I KNOW,

26:56.415 --> 26:58.785
PLANNED THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WEDDING,

26:58.818 --> 26:59.986
BUT EVERYTHING WENT WRONG,
AND THEY WERE

27:00.019 --> 27:01.854
EVEN GOING TO CANCEL IT.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.390
BUT THEN ALL THEIR FRIENDS

27:04.423 --> 27:08.995
POOLED THEIR TIME
AND TALENTS

27:09.028 --> 27:12.799
AND THEY CAME UP

27:12.832 --> 27:15.768
WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
CELEBRATION

27:15.802 --> 27:17.770
THAT YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE

27:17.804 --> 27:20.072
IN LESS THAN A DAY.

27:20.106 --> 27:23.042
IS ANY OF THIS
RINGING A BELL?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.448
- TED?

27:29.481 --> 27:32.318
[classical music]

27:32.351 --> 27:33.753
TEDDY?

27:33.786 --> 27:35.454
- DOWN HERE.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.290
- OH-HO, YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.458
- YEAH, AS LONG AS I SPEND

27:39.491 --> 27:41.828
THE REST OF MY LIFE
ON MY BACK.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.362
- IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
A DREAM OF MINE.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.765
- [chuckles]
- DID YOU TAKE YOUR PAIN PILLS?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.033
- YES, MOTHER.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.168
- NOT WITH THAT, I HOPE.

27:49.201 --> 27:53.172
YOU KNOW WHAT COMES FROM
TOO MUCH PILLS AND LIQUOR.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.174
- [exhales]
WELL,

27:55.207 --> 27:57.309
AT LEAST I'M OUT OF PAIN.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.045
- THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.914
- OH, THERE MAY BE MORE.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.083
I'M WAITING TO HEAR
FROM FIELD AND STEEN.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.987
- ABOUT THE NEW FISHING ROD
YOU ORDERED?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.455
- WELL, THAT'S
FIELD AND STREAM.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.190
THIS IS AN ACCOUNTING FIRM.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.325
I HEARD THEY HAD AN OPENING,

28:13.359 --> 28:15.361
SO I CALLED ALAN FIELD--
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND--

28:15.394 --> 28:17.930
AND HIS ASSISTANT
SAID HE'D RETURN.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.131
- [chuckles]

28:19.165 --> 28:21.100
[phone ringing]
AH.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.468
WELL, LOOK AT THAT,
LIKE I TOLD YOU.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.203
MAYBE THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.806
- UH, AT LEAST I AM.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.074
- THEODORE SCHMIDT RESIDENCE.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.408
EMMETT, IT'S LINZ.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.943
- OH, HI.
- HOW'S TEDDY?

28:30.977 --> 28:33.946
DOING LOTS BETTER.
- THAT'S GOOD.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.215
LISTEN, YOU REMEMBER THAT PARTY
I TOLD YOU ABOUT?

28:36.248 --> 28:37.817
- AT THE, UH, ART GALLERY.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.085
OH, HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.486
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT YOU
ON THE SPOT.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.354
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

28:42.388 --> 28:44.156
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.826
- REALLY?

28:46.859 --> 28:48.527
I'M GOING TO WORK
LINZ'S PARTY.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.496
- OH.
- SO DO YOU WANT ME TO, UM,

28:50.529 --> 28:53.465
POUR THE CAB
OR PARK THE CARS?

28:58.905 --> 29:01.273
OH, MY GOD.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.875
OH, MY GOD!
[laughs]

29:02.909 --> 29:04.510
OH, THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

29:04.543 --> 29:08.280
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

29:08.314 --> 29:10.883
OKAY!
[chuckles]

29:10.917 --> 29:12.418
- THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT
OF GRATITUDE

29:12.451 --> 29:14.286
JUST TO SAY "SHRIMP BALL?"

29:14.320 --> 29:17.256
- ACTUALLY, I WON'T BE WAITING
AT THE EVENT.

29:17.289 --> 29:20.459
I'LL BE GIVING IT.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.560
- OH-H.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.196
- "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLUE."

29:24.230 --> 29:26.532
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

29:26.565 --> 29:28.034
- SHE ASKED ME.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.002
- WELL, WHO TOLD YOU
TO ANSWER?

29:30.036 --> 29:31.470
- I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.

29:31.503 --> 29:34.907
- AH, BY UNDERCUTTING ME
IN FRONT OF THE CLIENT?

29:34.941 --> 29:37.276
YOUR JOB WAS
TO PUT UP THE BOARDS,

29:37.309 --> 29:38.878
WHICH YOU COULD BARELY DO,

29:38.911 --> 29:42.048
AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.283
- I'M SORRY.
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.451
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
IT WON'T.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.419
YOU'RE THROUGH.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.055
- ARE YOU FIRING ME?

29:49.088 --> 29:50.923
- YOU WANTED ON-THE-JOB
EXPERIENCE, RIGHT?

29:50.957 --> 29:54.093
LESSON ONE:
YOU FUCK UP, YOU'RE GONE.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.028
- BUT YOU GOT THE ACCOUNT.

29:56.062 --> 29:59.065
- AND SHE GOT MY BALLS,
THANKS TO YOU.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.433
- BRIAN--

30:01.467 --> 30:03.569
MR. KINNEY?

30:03.602 --> 30:06.038
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF
YOU'D GIVE ME A SECOND CHANCE.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.306
- I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU
THE FIRST ONE.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.242
NOW PACK UP YOUR SHIT
AND GO HOME.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.948
- I GUESS I SHOULD'VE
EXPECTED THIS.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.450
AFTER ALL, YOU NEVER WANTED ME
HERE TO BEGIN WITH,

30:18.484 --> 30:20.052
DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO SEE
MY FACE EVERY DAY

30:20.086 --> 30:22.488
WHEN YOU CAME IN TO WORK.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.323
ALTHOUGH I GUESS A PART OF ME
WAS KIND OF HOPING

30:24.356 --> 30:26.993
THAT EVENTUALLY
YOU WOULDN'T MIND IT,

30:27.026 --> 30:28.928
MAYBE YOU'D EVEN
GET USED TO IT.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.930
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

30:30.963 --> 30:34.633
- I GUESS I WAS WRONG,
TO THINK THAT--

30:34.666 --> 30:36.335
MM.
AH, FUCK IT.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.137
NEVER MIND.
- WHAT?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.538
THAT WHEN YOUR
LITTLE ROMANCE WITH

30:39.571 --> 30:41.007
PAGANINI JUNIOR WAS OVER,

30:41.040 --> 30:42.942
YOU COULD COME RUNNING BACK?

30:42.975 --> 30:44.410
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

30:44.443 --> 30:45.611
- SORRY.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.346
- I KNOW.
IT'S STUPID.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.215
- ALMOST AS STUPID
AS FALLING

30:49.248 --> 30:51.550
FOR HIS BULLSHIT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.486
BUT YOU'RE YOUNG
AND INEXPERIENCED.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.955
- WHAT, AND YOU'RE SO SMART?

30:55.988 --> 30:57.990
IF YOU HAD ANY FUCKING BRAINS
AT ALL,

30:58.024 --> 30:59.525
YOU NEVER WOULD'VE
LET ME LEAVE.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.994
YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME
I WAS MAKING

31:02.028 --> 31:03.495
THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.364
THAT I WOULD LIVE
TO REGRET IT,

31:05.397 --> 31:07.566
THAT WHAT YOU GAVE ME
WAS WORTH 1,000--

31:07.599 --> 31:09.501
A MILLION TIMES MORE

31:09.535 --> 31:13.105
THAN ANYTHING
HE HAD TO OFFER.

31:13.139 --> 31:17.109
YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME
THAT YOU LOVED ME,

31:17.143 --> 31:19.645
THAT YOU WOULD GO ON LOVING ME,
EVEN AFTER I WAS GONE.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.247
- IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE WAITING TO HEAR?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.282
- YES.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.251
BUT AS USUAL,
YOU NEVER SAID IT,

31:25.284 --> 31:29.255
SO IT'S JUST AS WELL
THAT I GO.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.591
- THAT IS SO LIKE YOU.

31:32.624 --> 31:36.295
YOU DON'T HEAR WHAT YOU WANT,
SO YOU LEAVE.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.331
TRY STANDING UP FOR YOURSELF
FOR A CHANGE.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.301
HAVE SOME BALLS.

31:54.346 --> 31:57.016
[indistinct chatter]

31:57.049 --> 31:58.717
- COME ON, WE'RE NOT
CALLING THE POLICE, MICHAEL.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.352
- BUT I-I DON'T WANT THEM
HANGING OUT

32:00.386 --> 32:02.021
IN FRONT OF OUR APARTMENT.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.289
WHAT IF ONE OF THEM
HAD A KNIFE OR A GUN?

32:03.322 --> 32:04.556
YOU COULD'VE BEEN
SERIOUSLY INJURED,

32:04.590 --> 32:06.192
OR EVEN KILLED.
- THEY'RE JUST KIDS.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.560
- THEY'RE NOT KIDS.
THEY'RE HUSTLERS.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.196
THEY'RE DRUG ADDICTS
AND THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.730
AND NOW THERE'S ONE
IN OUR GODDAMN BATHROOM.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.165
- I COULDN'T JUST LEAVE HIM
OUT ON THE STREET

32:13.199 --> 32:14.366
TO GET THE SHIT KICKED
OUT OF HIM.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.701
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

32:15.734 --> 32:17.436
- I THOUGHT
HE COULD STAY HERE.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.705
- WHAT?
- FOR JUST ONE NIGHT.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.573
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
NOT FOR ONE MINUTE.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.343
NOT FOR ONE SECOND.
- COME ON, IT'S CHRISTMAS.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.045
- IT IS NOT CHRISTMAS.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.480
- WELL, THEN SHOW
A LITTLE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT,

32:28.514 --> 32:30.449
A LITTLE LOVE
TOWARDS YOUR FELLOW MAN.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.984
- WHAT IF HE RIPS US OFF?

32:32.018 --> 32:33.452
OR MURDERS US
IN OUR BEDS?

32:33.485 --> 32:35.454
- WHAT IS HE GOING TO TAKE,
THE CD PLAYER?

32:35.487 --> 32:37.723
[door opens]

32:37.756 --> 32:40.659
- OKAY, WHO WANTS
TO FUCK ME FIRST?

32:43.762 --> 32:45.364
- THAT'S NOT WHY
WE BROUGHT YOU UP HERE.

32:45.397 --> 32:48.200
- WELL, THEN
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:48.234 --> 32:50.502
- FOR YOU NOT TO GET KILLED.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.604
- BIG LOSS IF I DID.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.074
- [exhales]

32:55.107 --> 32:56.342
- I'M GOING BACK TO WORK.

32:56.375 --> 33:00.379
- NOT WITH THAT.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.281
- SOMEONE SHOULD PROBABLY
LOOK AT IT.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.150
- I'LL TRY TO PICK UP
A DOCTOR.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.085
- UH-UH.
YOU'RE STAYING HERE TONIGHT.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.154
ALONE.

33:08.187 --> 33:11.123
NOW PUT THIS ON
AND FOLLOW ME.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.395
- [sighs]

33:20.399 --> 33:21.767
- OKAY.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.235
- WANT A GOOD TIME?

33:23.269 --> 33:24.570
WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUDDY.

33:24.603 --> 33:28.140
- OKAY, THAT'S TOO HIGH.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.408
NOW THAT'S TOO LOW.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.243
- OKAY, GIRLS, LINE UP!
[snapping]

33:31.277 --> 33:33.512
- OOH, THERE'S THE MAN
IN CHARGE.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.248
- OKAY.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.317
- I THINK YOU CAN DO
THE SAME WITH THAT ONE.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.252
[indistinct chatter]

33:40.286 --> 33:42.554
ONE, TWO, THREE.

33:42.588 --> 33:46.125
- WHO, OR SHOULD I SAY WHAT,
ARE THOSE PEOPLE?

33:46.158 --> 33:48.127
- MR. BLOOM, I CAN EXPLAIN.
YOU SEE--

33:48.160 --> 33:49.261
- HONESTLY,
PUT OUT A CALL

33:49.295 --> 33:51.663
FOR DRAG QUEENS,
NOT DREG QUEENS.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.465
- MR. BLOOM,
THIS IS EMMETT HONEYCUTT,

33:53.499 --> 33:55.334
THE NEW EVENT PLANNER.
- HOW DO YOU DO?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.436
UH, MAY I JUST SAY--
- NO.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.272
MAY I JUST SAY
THAT I TOOK A GREAT RISK

34:00.306 --> 34:02.441
IN ENTRUSTING YOU
WITH TONIGHT'S EVENT.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.076
I CERTAINLY HOPE,
FOR YOUR SAKE,

34:04.110 --> 34:06.078
YOU KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE DOING.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.579
- I LIKE YOUR BOW TIE.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.415
- GET OUT OF MY WAY.

34:09.448 --> 34:10.682
- I LOVE A MAN
WHO'S FORCEFUL.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.218
- TESTY, ISN'T HE?

34:12.251 --> 34:13.552
- OH GOD, EM,
PLEASE TELL ME

34:13.585 --> 34:15.454
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT

34:15.487 --> 34:18.290
AND I HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.492
- EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.428
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

34:22.461 --> 34:23.562
- GOOD.
[glass shatters]

34:23.595 --> 34:26.598
[gasps]

34:31.470 --> 34:33.839
OH, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S FUNNY?

34:33.872 --> 34:35.607
[deep breath]

34:35.641 --> 34:37.443
I REALLY WANTED TO GET BACK
INTO THE WORLD

34:37.476 --> 34:40.712
AND PROVE MYSELF, AND NOW,
ALL I WANT TO DO

34:40.746 --> 34:43.449
IS BE HOME WITH GUS,
CHANGING HIS DIAPER.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.184
- SAME WITH ME AND TED.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.219
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR
THE DIAPER THING.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.321
- IN FACT, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY PEOPLE

34:49.355 --> 34:50.889
WOULD EVER WANT
TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE.

34:50.922 --> 34:55.327
- WHEN IT'S SO MUCH SAFER
JUST TO CLOSE THE DOOR.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.863
- BUT IF YOU CLOSE THE DOOR,

34:57.896 --> 35:01.233
NOTHING'LL EVER HAPPEN,
WILL IT?

35:03.269 --> 35:06.272
- WELL, YOU'LL JUST SIT THERE
IN YOUR SAFE LITTLE ROOM

35:06.305 --> 35:08.374
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

35:08.407 --> 35:11.377
WONDERING WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.613
- WHAT TIME IS IT?

35:14.646 --> 35:17.249
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE
TO DO THIS?

35:17.283 --> 35:19.285
[both sigh]

35:19.318 --> 35:22.254
[indistinct chatter]

35:24.256 --> 35:27.359
- OKAY, GIRLS, LET'S, UH--
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.427
- OKAY.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.896
- NOW, THAT'S TOO LOW.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.431
THAT'S TOO HIGH.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.371
- HE'S STILL ASLEEP.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.807
MUST'VE BEEN EXHAUSTED.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.910
- I'M SURE,
WITH THE HOURS HE KEEPS.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.646
- YOU KNOW, TO LOOK AT HIM--

35:47.679 --> 35:49.281
THERE YOU GO.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.916
YOU'D THINK HE WAS LIKE
ANY OTHER TEENAGER.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.918
- WELL, HE'S NOT...

35:52.951 --> 35:55.254
AND HE'S NEVER GOING TO BE.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.922
- JESUS, MICHAEL,

35:56.955 --> 35:58.924
WHERE IS YOUR SENSE
OF COMPASSION?

35:58.957 --> 36:00.559
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO BE SO UNCARING.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.394
- IT'S BECAUSE I KNOW
WHERE THIS IS HEADING.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.396
"GEE, MOMMY,
CAN I KEEP POOCHIE?

36:04.430 --> 36:06.398
"I'LL WALK HIM.
I'LL FEED HIM.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.534
HE WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE,
I PROMISE."

36:08.567 --> 36:10.202
WELL, THE ANSWER'S NO.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.970
WE'RE NOT TAKING IN A STRAY.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.640
- DID I ASK YOU TO?

36:16.908 --> 36:19.945
- LOOK, I LOVE
HOW GOOD-HEARTED YOU ARE...

36:19.978 --> 36:21.880
- AS LONG AS I DON'T
ACT ON IT.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.415
- BUT ONE NIGHT IS ENOUGH.

36:23.449 --> 36:24.750
- SO WE SHOULD JUST TOSS HIM

36:24.783 --> 36:26.218
BACK ON THE STREET,
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

36:26.252 --> 36:27.819
- HE DOESN'T EVEN
WANT OUR HELP.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.421
HE'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU.
- WELL, HE'S WRONG,

36:29.455 --> 36:30.556
BECAUSE THE WAY HIS LIFE
IS GOING, IT'LL

36:30.589 --> 36:32.724
BE OVER BEFORE HE'S 20.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.362
- WHAT TIME IS IT?

36:36.395 --> 36:37.696
- IT'S ALMOST NOON.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.431
- OH, FUCK.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.632
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME?

36:40.666 --> 36:42.434
