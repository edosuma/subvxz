00:00.240 --> 00:03.640
'The following programme contains
strong language and violence

00:03.680 --> 00:05.680
from the start.'

00:10.200 --> 00:13.360
Hope is the daughter
of a blind father.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.920
If you hadn't done it,
then I'm not the blind father,

00:17.960 --> 00:20.120
and the prophecy
is not the prophecy.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.280
Cait, you can't escape this!
None of us can!

00:23.320 --> 00:24.920
Fuck the gods.

00:24.960 --> 00:28.600
I'll go to the underworld
and speak to the sister.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.440
-Who are you?
-I'm Rain.
It is the new Veran I guard.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.520
Do you know how to prepare
for the deep sleep?

00:34.560 --> 00:36.920
"The" deep sleep.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.600
What did you mean last time...

00:38.640 --> 00:40.800
when you said I was your baby?

00:40.840 --> 00:45.040
Go to your General Aulus,
tell him Queen Antedia is coming.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.840
Hello.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.040
Ya!

01:35.720 --> 01:38.880
Look where you're going.
The Roman camp, five miles North,

01:38.920 --> 01:41.560
there's not one bit
left standing on another.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.600
Burnt they were, all of them.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.840
What the fuck could do that?
-Thunderbolt?
-Giants.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.920
Whatever it is, they are
in serious fucking trouble.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.080
Right.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.280
Who's going first?
I'm Antedia,

01:55.320 --> 01:58.840
Queen of the Regni,
daughter of Bok the Dread,

01:59.640 --> 02:04.040
ruler of 100 hills,
scourge of all foe, or was.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.520
I've heard of you.
Everyone's heard of me.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.560
How have you heard of me?

02:10.600 --> 02:13.240
I'm Cantii, or was.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.120
You're Cantii?

02:15.160 --> 02:16.880
Before the Romans came, I...

02:16.920 --> 02:19.440
Cantii... Cantii scum!

02:19.480 --> 02:21.200
You drank the blood of your foe,

02:21.240 --> 02:24.040
who had two heads,
a demon horn for a sword,

02:24.080 --> 02:26.200
and rode a chariot of fire.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.680
Takes me right back.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.320
Who's that winged serpent?
What's his name?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.960
It's, uh, Scraggleback.
Scraggleback, the fiery serpent.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.040
Winged serpent. That's him.
Winged Serpent.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.400
I think a smart move
could catch him.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.360
So, Cantii, do you have a name?

02:45.720 --> 02:48.320
Cait.
What are you running from, Cait?

02:48.360 --> 02:51.320
I genuinely don't know.
Start at the beginning.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.240
Have you heard of a Druid
called Veran?

03:04.680 --> 03:06.280
Maybe.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.640
Veran thinks
I'm part of a prophecy.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.400
And are you?
No.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.640
And if I was,
I'm not any more.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.400
Good, if you ask me.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.240
Prophecy's like
everything that Druids spout,

03:26.280 --> 03:29.040
a bucket of
dangerously sloppy shit.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.440
You know what I think?
Despite your unfortunate provenance,

03:41.480 --> 03:45.120
we make a fine team. We should
--stick together.
-No.
-Oh, come on.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.200
You're looking for the General.
Who murdered your family.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.880
I'm sorry, the answer's no.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.600
Well, I'm glad we met.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.960
Look after yourself.
Keep your wits about you.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.120
And don't forget, whatever else
happens, boys are just for fun.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.840
I'll try and remember that.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.680
It was the gods.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.160
The gods have come to save us.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.600
Go, gods.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.600
Go on then! Go on!

04:42.720 --> 04:43.840
Shit!

04:47.200 --> 04:49.200
Dad?

04:55.680 --> 04:58.440

06:16.160 --> 06:17.760
Not getting squirrel.

06:30.880 --> 06:34.200
My journey to the below
filled me with sadness.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.080
Sadness and fear.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.640
It's not the same place, Quane.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.160
You'd not recognise it.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.120
Our dead have suffered much.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.400
Perhaps too much.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.600
10,000 years
I've walked these same lands,

06:53.600 --> 06:56.320
heard the same songs
on the same breezes.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.680
Now, everything is changing.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.600
Underworld is dying, Quane.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.840
Voices of our gods
get weaker with each sunrise.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.440
But you saw it.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.600
I did.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.880
If the spear of the silver dawn
is come,

07:16.920 --> 07:19.920
then hope remains.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.760
There was someone else there.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.840
Who?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.120
You wish to visit the dead.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.080
So, what makes
a top-brass warrior,

08:29.120 --> 08:32.240
the General's right-hand bobbin,
Mr swagger bollocks,

08:32.280 --> 08:34.720
what makes him
suddenly up and desert,

08:34.760 --> 08:37.360
then instead of
hopping the ship home,

08:37.400 --> 08:39.960
hang around chasing
some batshit Druid's

08:40.000 --> 08:42.360
100-year-old prophecy?

08:42.400 --> 08:45.800
Who told you about that?
Take a wild one.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.920
How did you find me?
Weren't easy.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.240
Made me all jump. Been searching
in these hills for days.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.040
And last night, we saw this ruddy
great explosion on the horizon.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.560
I say, "We." He saw it.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.720
And then we looked at each other,

09:06.760 --> 09:08.760
I say "We."

09:10.160 --> 09:12.160
How are you, girl?

09:13.480 --> 09:17.240
Not good.
I don't need eyes to see that.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.920
So, then you blinded him?

09:31.840 --> 09:33.000
Yes.

09:33.040 --> 09:37.840
Then you went back to the beach
-and there he was.
-The same beach.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.600
All I know is this is my path.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.760
This is what
I'm here for, only this.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.960
When your mother died,
one thing kept me going,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.880
I had a job to do.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.400
A task, you and Islene.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.520
I had a task and I'm now...

10:02.560 --> 10:04.720
I'm not going back.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.760
Cait.
I mean it.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.720
I'm finished.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.240
A friend out there
has been talking about a spear.

10:20.480 --> 10:24.720
-A spear?
-Says he brought it
with him from the East

10:24.760 --> 10:27.600
and he said you'd know
what he was talking about.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.480
Do you, Cait? Do you know
anything about this spear?

10:32.880 --> 10:36.000
The Druids call it
the spear of the silver dawn.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.680
It will come from the East.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.000
The prophecy says

10:47.040 --> 10:49.920
that when the
Chosen One possesses it,

10:49.960 --> 10:52.600
she will unite the tribes,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.360
drive the demon back into the sea.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.040
Watch it.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.600
These two won't hang themselves.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.680
Ah.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.160
I could murder a pint.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.960
Hey, isn't that
our old Praefectus?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.800
The one that did a runner?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.520
Well, pretty boy,
I'd say it's a toss-up,

11:36.560 --> 11:38.200
either you've lost your mind

11:38.240 --> 11:42.040
or you're caught up in something,
true or not, stuck in something

11:42.080 --> 11:45.360
that's gonna drive you stark
bollock berserk sooner or later.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.880
What's in this for you?
Nothing, I have no choice.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.520
You can do better than that.
It's out of my hands.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.560
Just...
Just what?

12:05.680 --> 12:08.400
I want to fuck him up.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.160
You sly bastard.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.280
Now you're talking.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
That's him, all right.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.560
Felix, mate,

12:22.600 --> 12:24.600
the gods may just
have smiled on us.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.160
You need to go, now.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.560
If what he's saying
makes any sense,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.320
if it means anything to you...
There's something

12:40.360 --> 12:42.360
I haven't told you.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.800
What?

12:45.840 --> 12:48.400
Veran.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.680
What about him?

12:50.720 --> 12:52.720
Cait, what about Veran?

12:54.360 --> 12:56.080
He's dead.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.200
How do you know that?

12:59.240 --> 13:01.720
Cait, how do you know
Veran's dead?

13:10.160 --> 13:12.120
Get away from me.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.560
What's happening?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.040
Fuck!

13:17.080 --> 13:19.120
Fucking traitor!

13:20.440 --> 13:22.520
Get off me!

13:22.560 --> 13:25.480
Cait?

13:25.520 --> 13:27.480
You fucking bastard!

13:27.520 --> 13:29.600
What's happening, Cait?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.280
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.440
This way, Dad!

13:38.480 --> 13:39.720
Fuck off!

13:43.120 --> 13:46.160
Dad, over here!
I'm with you.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.360
Dad! Wait!

13:50.400 --> 13:52.760
Run!
Wait! No!

13:52.800 --> 13:54.960
Dad! Dad!

13:58.720 --> 14:00.040
No!

14:05.640 --> 14:07.000
Dad!

14:25.760 --> 14:27.520
Where's my wife?

14:27.560 --> 14:30.880
Uh, yes, well,
it's a small world.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.920
So what the fuck does that mean?
You mean the High Priestess?

14:36.960 --> 14:40.320
When you went roving,
she went roving too.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.280
Where's my wife?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.880
Who are you?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.400
A friend.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.600
Where's the Witch?

15:15.800 --> 15:18.480
The Witch.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.280
The Witch?

15:21.320 --> 15:24.000
The Witch caught a sniffle,
the sniffle became a cold,

15:24.040 --> 15:26.480
the cold became a fever,
the Witch died.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.960
Stay where you are.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.680
Before she died,
she sent a message,

15:30.720 --> 15:33.840
my message reached the Druid,
I told him to come.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.520
Where is he?
You do not summon the Veran.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.920
A moment ago you asked who I was,
I said, "A friend."

15:41.960 --> 15:44.400
That was a lie,
I'm not a friend.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.080
I'm as far from a friend
as you could possibly get.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.480
You may not know me,
Veran does, of old.

15:51.520 --> 15:56.440
And when I say old,
I mean, old.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.560
My name is Hemple.

16:00.200 --> 16:05.240
Now, when Veran gets
a message from Hemple,

16:05.280 --> 16:08.960
the first thing he does,
shit his pants.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.120
The second thing
is get on his knees

16:11.160 --> 16:13.480
and beg his gods
to get him out of this.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.840
The third thing is to get
on his horse and come here,

16:17.880 --> 16:20.640
because he is too afraid
to do otherwise.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.280
He knows
how angry Hemple will be

16:24.320 --> 16:26.560
if he ignores her message.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.120
So, if Veran got
Hemple's message,

16:36.160 --> 16:38.360
then Veran would be here.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.040
Which begs the only question,

16:41.080 --> 16:42.880
what's wrong with Veran?

16:44.160 --> 16:48.160
Did he catch a sniffle?
Veran is not afraid of you.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.840
And neither am I.
Then why are you shaking?

16:51.720 --> 16:55.240
Or, or is it the wind?

16:55.280 --> 16:59.120
Oh, don't tell me
you're going to catch a sniffle?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.400
Whoops.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.800
Come on, Cantii.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.000
I've seen more fat
on a butterfly.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.120
No?

17:23.160 --> 17:25.440
Suit yourself.

17:25.480 --> 17:29.000
You asked me earlier why I wanted
revenge on the General.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.000
It's not because he took my throne.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.800
See, my father, Bok the Dread

17:34.840 --> 17:37.280
was only king,
because he boiled his father,

17:37.320 --> 17:41.000
Bok the Fearless
in a vat of oil.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.080
Thrones come and go.
No, no.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.600
No, no, that's not why
I hate the General.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.520
I had a son.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.480
He was my world.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.640
General Aulus murdered him.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.720
He took me, lied to me,
betrayed me, and then...

18:02.800 --> 18:05.160
he murdered my only child.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.480
I don't miss the power,
I miss my boy.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.640
And I will not
rest until I've had vengeance.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.760
It will make
what happened back there

18:17.800 --> 18:19.800
look like a spit in a spark.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.320
Until then all I have
is this fire,

18:25.360 --> 18:28.680
(SNIFFLES)..this crappy,
rotten bacon,

18:29.680 --> 18:31.280
this breeze.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.800
Cait.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.840
He's gone.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.280
You have to accept that.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.160
Or you'll go mad like me.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.600
I went mad
a long way back.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.680
Hello, squirt.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.640
You summoned me, Your Majesty.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.600
So, he was lying there,
you had him powerless,

20:19.640 --> 20:23.080
could've cut his throat, why didn't
-you?
-I thought you loved him.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.120
Don't piss me about,
we don't have time.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.440
To ask that shows you know
nothing about him, about his power.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.240
So he controls you?

20:32.280 --> 20:35.000
Then why did you
plot to kill him?

20:35.040 --> 20:37.400
Who says I did?

20:37.440 --> 20:39.960
Vitus, the Praefectus,
told me everything.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.280
Oh, really?
Where did that get him?

20:43.640 --> 20:46.680
You were planning to kill the
General and then she showed up.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.920
He told me, Willa, he told me.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.720
I'm cursed.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.560
I can do nothing myself
to harm him

21:01.600 --> 21:05.600
-any more than I can leave.
-You once
told me we should stick together.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.680
-I told you, can't harm him.
-I can!

21:10.360 --> 21:13.120
What about the High Priestess?
Fuck her.

21:13.160 --> 21:17.280
By the time she's back, we're gone.
That's why it has to be today.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.840
Yes or no?

21:27.440 --> 21:29.440
Dad's dead.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.520
He came to find me,

21:32.560 --> 21:33.960
to get me to go back.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.680
Dad is at peace now.
He knows he played his part.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.080
Islene, have I gone mad?

21:44.240 --> 21:46.480
Stop it!

21:47.400 --> 21:49.840
I had such big plans.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.360
I was gonna have six daughters,

21:53.400 --> 21:56.240
teach 'em all
how to hunt, fight.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.280
Turns out all I ever did
was for one thing.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.240
I know why they chose you, Cait.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.840
You may not, but I do.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.560
Even if I wanted to go back,
I can't.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.440
You mean Veran?

22:13.480 --> 22:15.000
You know?
Are you serious?

22:15.040 --> 22:18.480
Oh, everyone down there knows.
Veran's dead. Islene, I killed him.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.520
Says who?

22:21.400 --> 22:25.480
Don't get me wrong. It was touch
and go for a while. But...

22:25.520 --> 22:28.160
if he is dead...

22:28.200 --> 22:30.200
I haven't seen him.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.840
♪ Oh, the waters flow

22:40.960 --> 22:43.520

Well, who it isn't?

24:04.400 --> 24:06.400
I'd given you up for dead.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.120
You said we'd make a good team.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.520
And?
Will you help me?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.840
Pretty boy. What's his name?

24:17.880 --> 24:20.040
Told me about this spear thingy.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.360
Said you'd be interested.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.160
Tell me everything you know.

24:27.560 --> 24:31.960
Three drops in his wine,
no less, no more,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
or he'll spot it.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.360
Boo!

24:55.040 --> 24:57.240
You've been a quiet one lately.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.760
Hardly stepped outside.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.440
What have you been up to?

25:02.480 --> 25:04.560
Research.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.200
Fruitful?

25:06.240 --> 25:08.240
Very.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.280
Care to share?

25:12.080 --> 25:13.600
Fine, if you don't want to.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.520
Here's something
that might interest you.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.840
Uh, what's his name?
Blaine...

25:18.880 --> 25:23.560
My wife's intolerable,
utterly useless lapdog.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.760
Turns out
he has a use after all.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.160
He was out there today
farting about

25:28.960 --> 25:30.960
and he saw something.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.320
What?
The Witch...

25:37.680 --> 25:39.680
..paying you a visit.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.440
"Golly," he said,

25:44.480 --> 25:46.840
"I wonder what
those two are hatching?"

25:46.880 --> 25:48.800
And you believed him?
Oh, search me.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.520
He is a bit of a snake.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.400
Well, in this case,
the snake was telling the truth.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.920
The Witch did come to see me.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.400
Why?
I asked her to.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.960
Why?

26:10.240 --> 26:15.560
The prophecy of Veran
and the lore of Lokka overlap.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.200
I wanted to know
what the Druids know,

26:19.240 --> 26:21.720
think, make of our master.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.040
Oh.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.360
He's our master now, is he?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.800
You have no idea
what he will ask of you.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.960
No idea at all.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.640
Stick around.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.920
He'll show you
what real sacrifice is.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.320
I'll have a drop of that.
Priestess. You returned.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.120
Yes, this afternoon.
Welcome back.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.360
I trust your journey was fruitful.
Thank you, pretty tits.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.240
Oh, you look nice this evening.
Thank you.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.440
I'd say you're looking
especially delicious.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.880
Wouldn't you say?
You know what? I would.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.680
What's for supper?
That's just the thing.

27:03.720 --> 27:07.400
I didn't know you were
gonna be back so soon, so...

27:07.440 --> 27:09.840
Well, there must be
something we could pick at.

27:09.880 --> 27:15.160
I'm sure we can find something.
Well, we'll just have to make do.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.200
Just like that.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.880
No! What could I do?

27:45.880 --> 27:48.280
I shan't bore you...

27:48.320 --> 27:50.440
How was your little journey?

27:50.480 --> 27:55.040
-Find anything useful?
-Oh, extremely.
And I met with a Druid.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.680
You sneaky rabbit.
Well, I did tell you.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.920
These people can be
tricky buggers.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.560
Sometimes you just have
to sneak up on them.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.560
And as chance would have it,
our friend here has been busy too.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.360
Really? What have you been up to?

28:13.400 --> 28:16.800
She met with the Witch.
I thought she hated the Witch.

28:16.840 --> 28:20.360
Oh, down to her green bones.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.320
But there she was.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.280
The question is, why?

28:26.200 --> 28:28.720
Well, I imagine
it was perfectly innocent.

28:28.760 --> 28:31.880
Nothing to do with "Seizing
the day while the cat's away,"

28:31.920 --> 28:34.360
"Striking while the iron is hot."

28:34.400 --> 28:36.880
You want to know what I was up to,
I will tell you.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.440
But first, a toast.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.080
To safe homecomings.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.880
Oh, that is perfect.
Unimprovable.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.440
I tell you what, let's bloody do it.
Fuck it, let's.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.520
To safe homecoming.
Safe homecomings.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.840
Try it.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.960
Yummy.
Fabulous.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.520
-Isn't it?
-I don't think
there's anything better

29:17.560 --> 29:21.280
than a good drop of plonk.
Oh, me too. Me too.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.360
Well, Come on, then, sweetie.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.000
Spill the beans.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.200
Oh!

29:32.240 --> 29:33.920
Hello.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.800
What's this?

29:50.560 --> 29:52.680
I have it
on very good authority,

29:52.720 --> 29:56.000
if you swallow just one drop
before you can say,

29:56.040 --> 29:59.000
"Hello,
this tastes a bit funny",

29:59.040 --> 30:06.240
your kidneys boil, your eyes,
tongue, teeth turn to lard,

30:06.280 --> 30:08.080
and your arse
drops out of your arse.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.520
Oh.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.200
I didn't see this coming.
No, me neither.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
Well, come on, then.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.400
Where on earth did you get it?

30:47.120 --> 30:49.120
Surprise!

30:51.560 --> 30:53.560
Who's hungry?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.200
Higher.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.200
Look at the idiot.

31:25.760 --> 31:29.440
Better. One more.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.320
Hey, there. Maybe I can help.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.440
Fuck off.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.440
What news, Druid?

31:45.480 --> 31:48.480
I waited at the horse.
The Witch did not come.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.840
What?

31:54.080 --> 31:56.840
Someone's coming!

32:51.280 --> 32:53.680
I'll say this,
she's got balls.

32:53.720 --> 32:58.160
I mean, I've messed things
up before... royally.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.920
But who does that
and then walks back in here?

33:04.720 --> 33:06.800
She does.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.560
I'm not sorry.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.800
If I had the chance to go back,
I wouldn't change a moment,

33:15.400 --> 33:17.520
because if I hadn't done it,

33:17.560 --> 33:19.560
I wouldn't know what I know.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.520
Which is?

33:25.680 --> 33:27.680
That this is my path.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.960
I can't change it.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
There's no other one for me

33:37.200 --> 33:39.200
and I'll walk it to the end.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.080
We're just pawns
in this mad game.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.280
Well, let's play.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.120
Let's play the game.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.800
Your move, Cait.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.640
Whoa!
Why aren't you fucking dead?

33:55.680 --> 33:58.320
Hi, I'm Quant.
Knackers. Cantii.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.960
Prince fucking Phelan.
Once. Not any more.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
No more than you're still
-Queen Antedia.
-I am still queen.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.640
I'll let you guys catch up.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.440
The Chosen One asked for you.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.560
Cantii wanker.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.880
I'm not finished with you.
No probs, I'll be right here.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.480
I hate the Druids.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.600
Oh, how the wheel turns.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.920
This is my friend Antedia.
We've met.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.720
Sit.
And catch what you've got?

34:31.760 --> 34:33.920
No, thank you.
I'd rather stand.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.440
Tell me what the Roman soldier
told you about the prophecy.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.360
Phelan.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.400
Rolf.

34:50.640 --> 34:52.640
Quant.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
What next?

34:59.040 --> 35:02.640
He's buried it. Didn't say where.
If you want to find out where it is,

35:02.680 --> 35:05.600
you're gonna have to free
pretty boy and ask him.

35:05.640 --> 35:09.640
May I go now? Smells like
a badger's balls in here.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.200
'I will speak to all,
young and old.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.240
Bring them to the sacred stones.'

35:18.040 --> 35:21.240
Gather the Druids.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.280
Gather the Druids!

35:44.160 --> 35:47.800
I know many of you
have doubted me.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.640
Doubted the prophecy.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.960
But now the Chosen One
is returned

35:59.000 --> 36:01.640
and destiny calls.

36:03.720 --> 36:07.320
There is one come
to these lands from the East.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.840
He brought with him a spear.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.920
Your ancestors

36:14.960 --> 36:19.720
and their ancestors,
and their ancestors.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.960
They know its name.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.160
It is
the spear of the silver dawn.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.920
Only once the spear is found

36:30.960 --> 36:33.920
can the Chosen One
lead us into the light.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.640
She will choose among you a band

36:38.560 --> 36:43.600
to walk with her, protect her,
and learn from her.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.400
This is the first day
of a new age.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.600
I want to say something.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.640
I don't know who I am.

37:00.840 --> 37:04.080
I don't know where I'm going,
but I know why.

37:05.360 --> 37:09.000
Not for some prophecy
or him or you.

37:10.560 --> 37:14.040
I'm doing this for me, for Cait.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.440
I am not the Chosen One.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.040
I choose this myself.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.440
Hm. A bit selfish.

37:47.520 --> 37:52.040
-You summoned me.
-Time to prepare,
they're waiting inside.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.080
Of course.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.600
You too, Quant.
OK.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.360
What the fuck?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.520
On your feet, Druid.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.520
-I'm not a Druid.
-You are now.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.600
Well, well, well. I haven't
seen you in such a long time.

38:47.640 --> 38:51.040
-Queen Antedia.
-Well, at least
someone here knows what's what.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.360
You'll have to
enlighten me one day

38:54.400 --> 38:56.800
as to how you ended up
with all these...

38:56.840 --> 39:00.000
weirdos.
It's a long story.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.040
Well, it could be worse,
I suppose.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.920
You could be married
to a Cantii right now.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.080
Excuse me.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.480
Uh.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.880
Yeah.

39:13.920 --> 39:17.040
Erm, basically, why me?

39:20.160 --> 39:22.560
Because you know
what it's like to be lost.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.560
So you chose me?

39:28.840 --> 39:30.840
I chose all of you.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.480
Hi.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.240
Oh. Hi.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.680
What's wrong?

39:40.720 --> 39:42.160
What? Nothing.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.000
You sure?
Absolutely.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.840
Excited. Raring to go.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.120
OK. I don't like horses.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.600
I'm not good with horses.

39:56.240 --> 39:59.000
Well, you better learn.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.040
Yeah.
By the way...

40:02.360 --> 40:04.640
It happened.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.160
What happened?

40:07.240 --> 40:09.560
The Great Vision.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.760
That's why I came back.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.200
Couldn't have
done it without you.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.720
So tell me, who is he?

40:32.120 --> 40:33.760
No idea.

40:33.800 --> 40:38.240
-He just looked fun.
-Listen, sweetie.
I'm not sure about this.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.680
About what?
Oh, it's just...

40:41.480 --> 40:44.400
I'm not sure
that this is my kind of quest.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.360
It's not a quest.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.600
It's cold-blooded revenge.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.080
Find the spear, Cait.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Before Rome.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.520
What spear?

41:03.560 --> 41:05.960
The spear of the silver dawn.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I'll just follow you, then,
shall I?

41:28.080 --> 41:31.480
So, there's this farmhand
who goes to work on a farm

41:31.520 --> 41:36.120
and he's in the yard and he sees
this pig with only three legs.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.720
He asks the farmer,
"What's with the pig there?"

41:39.840 --> 41:41.960
The farmer says,
"Well, a few years ago,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.760
the farmhouse caught fire
and that pig ran in,

41:44.800 --> 41:47.680
raised the alarm, saved me,
my wife and all three kids.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.480
We'd have burnt to a crisp
if it wasn't for that pig."

41:53.440 --> 41:56.920
The farmhand says,
"But how did he lose the leg?"

41:56.960 --> 42:02.600
And the farmer says, "Oh, right.
Well, with a pig that useful,

42:02.640 --> 42:06.760
you don't eat him all at once."

42:55.560 --> 42:58.760
Oh, in all the excitement,

42:58.800 --> 43:00.960
I forgot to say,
I've been a clever girl.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.560
Oh, yeah? How's that?

43:06.680 --> 43:08.080
Eeny...

43:09.920 --> 43:11.200
meeny...

43:13.160 --> 43:14.680
miny...

43:15.960 --> 43:18.280
moe.

43:18.320 --> 43:21.280
I caught a Druid.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.320
By the toe.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.800
I like it.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.680
Oh, I am vanquished!

44:02.840 --> 44:04.840
'Kneel, General Aulus.'

44:11.320 --> 44:15.040
