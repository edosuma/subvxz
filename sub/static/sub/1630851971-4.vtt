00:02.480 --> 00:03.786
For all the upcoming
product lines...

00:03.829 --> 00:05.092
- Yeah.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.528
- We really need to think
about just the branding.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.095
The presentation.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.922
I think just with everything
that I went through in life

00:09.966 --> 00:13.839
as a teenager, I just kind of
equated success to freedom.

00:13.883 --> 00:16.190
<i>So I feel that's why
I've always had this drive</i>

00:16.233 --> 00:19.628
just to work so hard
and to become so successful.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.369
So I'm just stressing
about Mom.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.848
I don't know if I want
to get married at the church,

00:22.892 --> 00:24.024
and I feel like that's gonna
really hurt her feelings,

00:24.067 --> 00:25.460
but...

00:25.503 --> 00:27.114
<i>- I think she wants
that church wedding,</i>

00:27.157 --> 00:29.029
<i>but it's not her wedding.</i>

00:29.072 --> 00:30.465
<i>It's your wedding.</i>

00:30.508 --> 00:32.293
<i>- Brooklawn
was my grandfather's estate.</i>

00:32.336 --> 00:34.251
When he passed away,
they sold it.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.253
<i>The last time
that I was at Brooklawn</i>

00:36.297 --> 00:38.516
<i>was the last time
that I saw my grandfather.</i>

00:38.560 --> 00:40.040
- Wow. Look at that.
- Wow.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.651
<i>That would be so amazing.
Like, can you imagine?</i>

00:42.694 --> 00:46.089
<i>- It's so clear to me,
seeing Paris on Brooklawn,</i>

00:46.133 --> 00:49.527

you go to your mom's from?

02:26.276 --> 02:27.886
- Is he doing mom's makeup?

02:27.930 --> 02:30.280
- I hope--well, she can't
find her makeup, so, yes.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.282

02:32.326 --> 02:34.110
<i>So excited to be

02:34.154 --> 02:36.025
I'm gonna be DJing
the grand opening

02:36.068 --> 02:38.462

<i>Resorts World

- No. Am I going to your mom's?

02:47.776 --> 02:49.821
- My mom's room.
- Okay. I'll take some.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.607
- For sure?
- I have no idea, but--

02:52.650 --> 02:55.566
- Oh, my God.
I don't know what's happening.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.699
- All right.
I'll be back tomorrow.

02:57.742 --> 03:02.878
- Yes, and then
we'll do touchups before...

03:02.921 --> 03:04.140
- Yeah. I'll be around.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.446

- Thank you, Jayden.

03:08.449 --> 03:09.972

03:10.015 --> 03:14.281
- I had an 8:00 a.m. flight,
but I'm so happy to be here.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.849
- I know.
- I just, like, I love Vegas.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.808
I love landing.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.636
I don't know
if you feel this way,

03:21.679 --> 03:25.248
but, like, this sense of pride

03:25.292 --> 03:26.641
when you're just
going down the strip,

03:26.684 --> 03:31.863
and you see Caesar's
and the Flamingo Hilton

03:31.907 --> 03:33.517
and Conrad, and now this.

03:33.561 --> 03:38.479
It's like, our grandfather
was so instrumental in Vegas.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.828
- Yeah. He built it.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.612
- I mean, he just
couldn't believe it.

03:41.656 --> 03:45.703
He's like, "I used to pay Elvis
for 12 shows a week."

03:45.747 --> 03:50.882
He invented all these amazing
residencies at these hotels.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.188
- Yes.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.537
- Now we're here
for your shows...

03:53.581 --> 03:54.625
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.279
- And it's coming
very full circle.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.889
- I know.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.631
<i>My family's been obsessed
with Vegas my entire life.</i>

04:00.675 --> 04:03.504
Think it really goes back
to my grandfather Barron.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.420
<i>My grandfather would always
say, like, "I, you know,</i>

04:06.463 --> 04:08.552
<i>"I'm one of the people
who started this town,</i>

04:08.596 --> 04:11.860
"and now, to see
my granddaughter coming here

04:11.903 --> 04:14.993
"and just literally
taking it over is--

04:15.037 --> 04:16.865
I'm just so proud of you."

04:16.908 --> 04:18.562
<i>And I know in my heart
that I would not be</i>

04:18.606 --> 04:21.304
<i>the businesswoman I am today
if it were not for him.</i>

04:21.348 --> 04:22.697
- Did you finish your DJ set?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.133
- I don't know
what type of music to play,

04:24.176 --> 04:25.874
because it's like
a hotel opening,

04:25.917 --> 04:27.092
and it's very corporate.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.485
It's like,
I'm used to playing at, like,

04:28.529 --> 04:29.834
2:00 in the morning for...

04:29.878 --> 04:31.271
- Yeah.
- Like, people raging.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.924
- I think you need
to play some...

04:32.968 --> 04:34.274
- I'm freaking out.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.798
- Stuff that the older people
will know, too,

04:36.841 --> 04:39.104
'cause it will be
a lot of the Hilton execs,

04:39.148 --> 04:40.541
and I don't think

04:40.584 --> 04:43.761
they're gonna understand
your Ibiza rave music.

04:43.805 --> 04:44.936
- I know.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.244
I love making music,
and I love DJing.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.594
<i>Just being up onstage,
and playing my music,</i>

04:50.638 --> 04:53.510
<i>and just watching
the whole crowd sing the words</i>

04:53.554 --> 04:55.730
is just such
an incredible feeling.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.733
- Definitely throw in
some music with words.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.561
- Like Madonna,
Michael Jackson, and...

05:00.604 --> 05:01.910
- Yeah.
- Whitney Houston. Classics.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.999
- Britney.
- Definitely Britney.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.174
I'm so stressed out.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.568
- What time did you go to bed?
- 4:00.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.352
- 4:00? What are you
doing until 4:00?

05:09.396 --> 05:11.267
- Mom was calling me.
- Oh, my God.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.662
You and Mom
are two of the same.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.229
Where is Mom?
- I don't know.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.796
The last I heard
that she didn't have

05:18.840 --> 05:20.842
a makeup artist or something.
I have no idea.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.453
- Should we call her?
- Yeah.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.368
- Call her.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.501
Do you have a filter on this?
- No.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.024
- I just naturally
look that cute?

05:29.067 --> 05:32.027
- This good? Yep. <i>
- Hi, honey. How are you?</i>

05:32.070 --> 05:34.116

- Not much.</i>

05:34.159 --> 05:37.685

05:39.730 --> 05:41.166
<i>What do you have on?</i>

05:41.210 --> 05:46.215
- Nothing. Just, like,
a little, cozy tracksuit.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.436
<i>- I like that.
Oh, and you have one on too?</i>

05:49.479 --> 05:51.568
- Mm-hmm.
- Is the casino open?

05:51.612 --> 05:54.179
Can we gamble? Nothing's open.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.965
<i>- Don't you have anything
in the mini bar?</i>

05:57.008 --> 05:59.446
- No.
I'm talking about gambling.

05:59.489 --> 06:00.925
Okay.
Well, hurry up, Mom,

06:00.969 --> 06:03.798
and meet us in the lobby
in 20 minutes.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.234

- Sure.</i>

06:05.277 --> 06:07.149
<i>- Until 2:00 in the morning.</i>

06:07.192 --> 06:11.327
<i>I had, like, 104 of those
things that people send you.</i>

"Things."

They love to pull my tail.

"Oh, fix that,"
or, "I don't like those."

06:24.166 --> 06:25.994
Nicky gets Paris psyched up.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.736
Paris would never even think
or know to do that,

06:28.779 --> 06:30.781
but then she hears
Nicky doing it.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.827
Then she'll go,
"Yeah, you know."

06:32.870 --> 06:34.350

just got here.</i>

09:04.282 --> 09:06.110
Okay, hold on, one second.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.160
- Are you only in it
or all of us?

09:12.203 --> 09:17.426
- Our mom has turned
into this pop culture icon.

09:17.469 --> 09:21.038
When she signed on to do
"Housewives of Beverly Hills"

09:21.082 --> 09:23.824
she really rose
to the occasion.

09:23.867 --> 09:28.872
She was herself,
and she is hysterical,

09:28.916 --> 09:33.529
and the public fell in love
with her, and kudos to her.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.836
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yes.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.577
Tell me if I'm making
a cute face. Hold on.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.057
- Well, don't talk.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.885
Oh, "live" is on.
Live is bad.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.626
It makes pictures beyond,
so live off.

09:43.670 --> 09:44.758
- Oh, let's do a live.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.324
- A live?
- Definitely.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.849
We just have to do a live
and say "hi" to everybody.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.677
- This is a woman
who doesn't know

09:50.720 --> 09:52.635
how to turn a microwave on,

09:52.679 --> 09:55.290
who didn't know
how to send a text message

09:55.333 --> 09:56.770
till very recently,

09:56.813 --> 10:00.774
so to see her
putting herself out there,

10:00.817 --> 10:04.168
going live, it's hysterical.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.996
- Hello.
- Yes.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.260
- Hi.
I want to see lots of hearts.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.915
That's my new baby voice.

10:11.959 --> 10:15.658
- Paris and my mom
both do that baby voice,

10:15.702 --> 10:18.008
<i>and I find it very annoying.</i>

10:18.052 --> 10:20.054
- I started the baby voice.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.882
You know,
when you want something.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.710
I'm gonna ask you,
but I'm not gonna ask you,

10:23.753 --> 10:25.146
'cause I know
you're gonna say no.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.713
So excited.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.759
- I love you.
- I love you. You're so nice.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.719
- You don't want to make
sad.

10:32.762 --> 10:36.897
Like that, right?
- Kind of.

10:36.940 --> 10:37.941
- I agree, it's beyond.
I've been doing it...

10:37.985 --> 10:39.769
- It's beyond.
- Forever.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.293
Probably 'cause Mom taught me.

10:42.337 --> 10:46.689
- She does it when she's shy
or she wants something.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.473
She probably heard it
as a little girl.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.605
I'm a little to blame.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.085
- But mine's like yeah--

10:51.128 --> 10:52.913
- Yours is like,
"Hi. It's Paris.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.436
"Can't get to the phone
right now.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.611
Leave a message,
and I'll call--"

10:55.655 --> 10:58.788
- No. It's like--
- It's like a porn line.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.311
- Thanks. Bye.

11:00.355 --> 11:05.273
- Live from Las Vegas.
- At the Conrad Hilton Hotel.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.101
And we are
at the opening night.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.712
We're all excited
to watch Paris perform.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.715
- So good to be back in Vegas.
I can't wait to DJ tonight.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.500
- And--
- Raul says you look so hot.

11:15.544 --> 11:16.719
- Thank you, Raul.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.808
- Living queens.
- Oh, my goodness.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.549
I wish that you guys
could all be here.

11:20.592 --> 11:25.554
Can't you get in? Just come.
Just say that the IG-inator...

11:25.597 --> 11:27.251
- Invited you.
- Invited you.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.557
You know, Paris and Nicky

11:28.600 --> 11:29.906
named me--
what is it called again?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.734
- The IG.
- The Instant GOAT,

11:31.778 --> 11:35.303
so please come tonight.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.087
I want all the people
to be there.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.829
I want to have a good time.

11:39.873 --> 11:43.746
Wait. YOLO. YOLO.

11:43.790 --> 11:44.878
- All right.
- All right. We have to go.

11:44.921 --> 11:45.879
I love you guys.
- So wait a minute--

11:45.922 --> 11:47.097
- Peace.
- Peace.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.751
- Was that good?
- All right.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.536
- No. It's a private opening.
- Well, Mom's just invited...

11:51.580 --> 11:52.712
- I know.
- The whole world.

11:52.755 --> 11:53.800
- And you said
that they're gonna ask

11:53.843 --> 11:54.975
for the IG-inator at the door.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.977
- They're gonna--the what?

11:57.020 --> 11:59.153
- My whole life my mom

11:59.196 --> 12:01.764
has always been
very concerned about,

12:01.808 --> 12:03.897
you know,
projecting this perfect life,

12:03.940 --> 12:06.551
and now, I've just seen,
within the past year,

12:06.595 --> 12:09.772
she's changed so much
where she doesn't care

12:09.816 --> 12:11.339
what anyone thinks about her.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.994
<i>That's the side
I always knew about her.</i>

12:14.037 --> 12:17.084
She's just, like, a fun,
silly--and now,

12:17.127 --> 12:18.999
just seeing her, you know,

12:19.042 --> 12:21.653
show that part of herself,
you know, in public.

12:21.697 --> 12:25.266
<i>I don't know, it just makes me
happy to see that.</i>

12:25.309 --> 12:27.181
When I'm a mom, one day,
that's how I want to be.

12:27.224 --> 12:30.662
I don't want my kids to have
to pretend they're perfect,

12:30.706 --> 12:33.187
because no one is.

if it rains?

12:53.424 --> 12:57.733
It's so hot, like,
I didn't realize it would rain.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.127
- My hair.
- Yeah. Let's go to the--

13:00.170 --> 13:03.304

13:09.049 --> 13:11.094

13:27.676 --> 13:30.374
Dear God, please stop raining.
This is beyond.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.812
It's my first time
back in Vegas, so long,

13:32.855 --> 13:34.988
and this is going to suck.

13:36.511 --> 13:39.514
Oh, no.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.777
Can they, like,
put a cabana over the DJ set?

13:41.821 --> 13:44.258
Like, I don't know what to do.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.086
Oh, my God.
Stop raining, please.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.436
- This is nuts. Okay.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.830
They can't set up, because
there's thunder and lightning,

13:50.873 --> 13:52.092
so they're gonna
get electrocuted,

13:52.135 --> 13:53.876
if they continue
plugging stuff...

13:53.920 --> 13:55.138
- Oh, my God.
- Because there's no way

13:55.182 --> 13:56.270
they can do it;
it's gonna be a hazard.

13:56.313 --> 13:59.142
- Oh, my God.
- Who's gonna come?

13:59.186 --> 14:01.666
- I don't know.
- Who's gonna come to this?

14:01.710 --> 14:03.451
- This is so

14:04.974 --> 14:07.281
I don't think it's gonna stop.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.935
Like, is no one
doing anything now?

14:08.978 --> 14:10.240
Everyone's having
a panic attack?

14:10.284 --> 14:12.503
- Everyone's having

14:12.547 --> 14:16.986
Look at the lifeguard.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.705

<i>And every time
I'd be at a party,</i>

15:25.272 --> 15:28.101
I'd be talking with the DJs,
telling them what to play,

15:28.144 --> 15:30.451
and I just saw
just how much fun it was,

15:30.494 --> 15:33.193
so I hired the best people
in the business

15:33.236 --> 15:35.238
and learned everything
there was to learn.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.023
So how loud can I go?

15:37.066 --> 15:38.589
- If we need you to back it up
a little bit,

15:38.633 --> 15:39.939
I'll be right over there.
Just give me--

15:39.982 --> 15:41.201
- Yeah, if someone tells me,

15:41.244 --> 15:43.420
because one time
I DJed in Brazil,

15:43.464 --> 15:45.292
and somebody touched it
for one second,

15:45.335 --> 15:46.902
and then everyone
was talking about me.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.425
- Oh, no.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.949
- Just because they didn't have
the main volume up,

15:49.992 --> 15:51.602
so don't want that
to happen again

15:51.646 --> 15:52.647
- No worries.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.083
<i>- At my first concert,</i>

15:54.127 --> 15:57.217
I was opening up a music
festival for Jennifer Lopez,

15:57.260 --> 15:59.393

I just fell in love with it.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.873

16:01.917 --> 16:03.571

Both sides are good.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.749
- Paris, we have a mic
right here, for you.

16:07.792 --> 16:12.058
- So when I'm doing--
does it give feedback?

16:12.101 --> 16:13.581
- No, you should be fine.
It'll be good.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.235
- It won't do that weird,
crazy noise?

16:15.278 --> 16:17.063
- No, you should be all right.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.978
If it does, we'll max you out
a little bit--

that was actually my set.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.598

16:30.641 --> 16:32.643
so I can pretend to be on it,
in case I get buried?

16:32.687 --> 16:34.994

when I...

20:59.823 --> 21:01.216

the same taste in furniture?

23:00.466 --> 23:01.989

neon lights in here?

23:06.776 --> 23:08.343
- Probably.

It's work.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.786

23:21.574 --> 23:23.314

23:23.358 --> 23:25.882
- I'm not gonna bring, like,
all, like, the Tinkerbell

23:25.926 --> 23:28.319

and make it too girly,

23:28.363 --> 23:31.758

swatches of fabric.

but I'm thinking, like, pink.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.107
- I had a feeling
it was gonna be pink.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.328
- 'Cause we hated Nicky's
bridesmaid dresses.

25:06.766 --> 25:09.116
Nicky's bridesmaid dresses
were beyond.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.771

- Pink chiffon.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.130
- Or neon pink.
No.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.871
- I love the neon pink
that she does.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.394

like, a soft...

25:26.437 --> 25:27.743
- Okay, fine.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.049
- Like, kind of blushy pink.
- All right, so...

25:29.092 --> 25:30.572
We have a date.
- 11/11.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.095

We have a date.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.270
- Yay.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.533
- Let's celebrate to that,

25:34.576 --> 25:36.230
but let's also
not tell everyone,

25:36.273 --> 25:39.668
because if I invite everyone
I know, it will literally be...

25:39.712 --> 25:40.887
- No. You can't.
- 50,000 people.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.976
He has, like,
75 people in his family.

I met the whole family,
after dating for one month.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.597
I've spent
Christmases with them.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.903
Now, two Thanksgivings.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.731
- Wait, for Christmas you said?
- Yes.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.384
- What?
- I went both Christmases.

26:00.428 --> 26:01.734
- No.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.039
- We have to say
it's my year this year...

26:03.083 --> 26:04.171
- Yeah.
- So we'll be in L.A.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.912
- Yeah, but also...
- Wow.

26:05.955 --> 26:08.088
- When you have a baby then you
get to choose all the holidays,

26:08.131 --> 26:10.046
and they're all yours.
- Yeah.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.833
- Carter wants
right after the wedding.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.225
That's why we're rushing.

26:15.269 --> 26:18.272
- We have to get them
in the oven

26:18.315 --> 26:19.969
January, February, March,

26:20.013 --> 26:22.755
because I really want kids
that are old for their class,

26:22.798 --> 26:24.757
because then
they're good at sports.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.585
Then they get more confidence.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.283
I'm crazy like that.
- Uh-huh. I don't even know...

26:29.326 --> 26:31.415
Like, I don't want to be
pregnant at the wedding,

26:31.459 --> 26:32.416
obviously...
- No.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.592
- 'Cause my dress, but...

26:33.635 --> 26:35.071
- No.
You want to enjoy your wedding.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.943
- During the honeymoon.
- Try and all that.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.292
- That's so soon.
- Oh, my God.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.685

26:39.728 --> 26:41.469

- Yeah.

26:41.512 --> 26:42.644
- Literal anxiety?
- Yeah.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.993
- Are you what?
- What are they?

26:44.037 --> 26:46.561
- I'm terrified.
- You're gonna be amazing.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.955
- I can't wait to be a mom
and start a family,

26:48.998 --> 26:50.696
but I also get kind of nervous,

26:50.739 --> 26:52.785

<i>and playing shows and concerts
all around the world.</i>

27:05.885 --> 27:09.279
And I know I'm gonna have
to give a lot of that up.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.761
But I have the eggs all ready,
so just insert them, and...

27:12.805 --> 27:14.067
- Insert them...
- Go.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.459
- And go.
- With a turkey baster?

27:15.503 --> 27:17.113
- But it's still--it's, like,
a process I heard?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.680
- I don't know.
I haven't really--

27:18.724 --> 27:20.682
- My client did it recently.
You have to, like, go, and--

27:20.726 --> 27:22.031
- A turkey baster?

27:22.075 --> 27:24.338
- Basically, and then you,
like, elevate,

27:24.381 --> 27:26.688
and they have to stick in,
and then you just wait.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.037
- What?
- And that's it.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.692
- By yourself?
- I don't know. I'm sure--

27:30.736 --> 27:32.172
- A doctor does it,
or you do it?

27:32.215 --> 27:33.913
- No. You don't do it yourself.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.741
- A doctor does it.
- It's a procedure.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.177
- Carter and I
started doing IVF

27:37.220 --> 27:39.005
only after a few months
of dating,

27:39.048 --> 27:41.181
so once we're married,
we'll have the embryos ready,

27:41.224 --> 27:44.140
so that one day
we can get pregnant right away.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.361
- What?

27:47.404 --> 27:50.494
- Your gynecologist.
Since ours retired--

27:50.538 --> 27:51.626
- Dr. Harris.
- He did?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.019
- No. He retired.
He did?

27:53.062 --> 27:54.020
- He retired.
- When?

27:54.063 --> 27:55.021
- He sent an email out.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.153
- He delivered,
like, all of us.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.285
- I know,
so what are we gonna do?

27:58.328 --> 27:59.416
You don't have one?
- No.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.027
- Oh, great.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.768
- I've been going to Dr. Wong
who's, like, my IVF doctor.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.160
- Yeah, but you need
a gynecologist too.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.422
- Oh, it's different?
- Yeah.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.860
- So my Uncle Rick filmed...
- All of us.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.688
- Every single one
of our births.

28:09.731 --> 28:10.993
- Yeah.
- Up close, my mom, Kyle.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.168
- What?
- Not vagina up close.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.692
- What?
- From the back.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.782
- Your dad filmed them?
- My mom's weird like that.

28:16.825 --> 28:18.522
They wanted everyone
in the room.

28:18.566 --> 28:22.744
I remember Vanna White was in
the delivery room, for Barron.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.224
- What?

28:24.267 --> 28:27.270
- They're close, close friends,
but yes.

28:27.314 --> 28:31.797
- Vanna White is one of our
oldest, oldest family friends,

28:31.840 --> 28:35.061
and she was in the room.

28:35.104 --> 28:39.805
My mom's always treated
a delivery like a party.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.241
- I wouldn't want anyone
in the room for that.

28:41.284 --> 28:44.418
Like, that sounds crazy.
- I know. I don't get--

28:44.461 --> 28:46.202
- You'd be so embarrassed.
Like, you're, like...

28:46.246 --> 28:48.204
- Pushing.
- Bleeding and, like, ew.

28:48.248 --> 28:49.292
- Yeah.

28:51.512 --> 28:54.776
- No. It's disgusting.
- No.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.299
- Like, as you said that,
I was, like...

28:56.343 --> 28:57.518
- Did you?
- Touching the caviar.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.259
- Did you?
- I had it ground into pills.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.217
- No you did not.
- A friend did that.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.437
- Did it do anything? Like--
- Your hair looks gorgeous!

29:04.960 --> 29:06.396
- That's what it is.
- Wow.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.397
- Oh, my God.

29:07.441 --> 29:08.921
- I would heave
looking at that.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.574
- I saw yours.
It's crazy-looking.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.838
- I'm gonna find the picture
of my placenta.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.753
- No. I'm gonna puke.
- Yes. Show us.

29:14.796 --> 29:15.797
- Yeah.
- Ew.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.495
- Okay. Let me look.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.410
- Why is it on jalapeños?
- Why is it on jalapeños?

29:20.454 --> 29:21.585
- It was air dried.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.109
- And then what?
You cooked it and ate it?

29:23.152 --> 29:25.851
- It looks like a filet mignon.
- Ew.

29:25.894 --> 29:28.592
- Filet mignon.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.769
- Okay, we're gonna
change the subject.

29:30.812 --> 29:31.944
- Ew.
- Thanks.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.859
Ugh.
-

29:33.902 --> 29:35.686
- Really happy Nicky
showed me that photo.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.558
I will never eat steak again.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.909
- You're gonna be so skinny
for your wedding.

Slivington, calm down.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.802

a new house.

30:03.845 --> 30:04.977
- I know.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.326
Think it was the best decision
we made,

30:06.369 --> 30:08.197
to get a house together, right?
- Yes.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.200
- Let's put down
the blanket here.

30:11.244 --> 30:16.162
I like this.
Oh! Oh.

30:16.205 --> 30:17.598
- Oh, my gosh.
- All right.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.601
This is preparing me
for fatherhood.

30:20.644 --> 30:24.257
How are we gonna do it
with kids and these crazy dogs?

30:24.300 --> 30:25.867
- It's gonna be
quite a handful.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.521
- Yeah. I love you.

30:27.564 --> 30:28.827
- I love you.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.872

Stay calm.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.309
Okay. Hang out with--no.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.746
you're gonna stay calm,
Slivington.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.226
Yeah. Your turn.
Oh, yeah.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.012
The dogs are fun,
but I can't wait

30:40.055 --> 30:42.318
till we have our little crew.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.538
- Me too.
- It's gonna be amazing.

30:44.581 --> 30:46.366
- So much fun.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.063
- The hardest part is
we're gonna have to figure out

30:48.107 --> 30:50.718
how to balance them.
- I know.

30:50.761 --> 30:53.634
- As hard as you like to work,
as hard as I like to work,

30:53.677 --> 30:55.070
just have to figure out
how to use our time.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.593
We're gonna have to make
every hour count.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.813
Just gonna have to prioritize,
you know?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.510
Make sure you can DJ,

31:00.554 --> 31:04.384
but you know, you'll probably
do it less than you did before.

31:04.427 --> 31:07.126
- I know. I just have to work
on my schedule.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.563
It's so, so much.

31:09.606 --> 31:14.089
It's gonna be hard to do
all of it, which worries me.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.352
- Every hour you're working
or I'm working is an hour

31:16.396 --> 31:18.224
we're not being good parents.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.095
I know how important it is
for both of us,

31:20.139 --> 31:22.228
just given what incredible
families we've had.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.751
We got a lot going on
this fall, between...

31:23.794 --> 31:25.013
- I know.

31:25.057 --> 31:28.016
- Getting our family started
and the wedding.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.148
Are you tired
just thinking about it?

31:29.191 --> 31:31.454
- Yes. It's a lot.

31:35.023 --> 31:38.113
- Why are you worried?
You look worried.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.507
- I just get nervous,
just with my schedule

31:40.550 --> 31:42.422
and everything
that's happening.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.076
I love DJing.
I love performing.

31:44.119 --> 31:46.817
I love traveling, and...

31:46.861 --> 31:48.080
I know when I have a family

31:48.123 --> 31:49.559
I'm not gonna be able
to do all that.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.302
- Would I rather
fly somewhere and DJ,

31:53.346 --> 31:55.435
or would I rather spend time
with my children, right?

31:55.478 --> 31:57.263
But I think that's
a good thing, right?

31:57.306 --> 31:59.178
It means wherever
you're spending time

31:59.221 --> 32:01.006
it's just gonna be
more impactful,

32:01.049 --> 32:02.746
so I'm sure every couple
struggles with it,

32:02.790 --> 32:04.183
'cause it's a lot of change.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.662
It's not gonna be easy.

32:05.706 --> 32:08.317
<i>Paris knows
I'm incredibly type A.</i>

32:08.361 --> 32:10.841
We know we're gonna
have to pull back on the work.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.408
How to reshuffle things.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.497
How to prioritize things,
and you know,

32:14.541 --> 32:17.587
the one thing that none of us
have more of, is time,

32:17.631 --> 32:19.111
and so we're gonna have to be
really thoughtful

32:19.154 --> 32:21.026
on how we use our time.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.289
Even if we have to go
a little less hard,

32:23.332 --> 32:25.595
so that we can, you know,
still do that

32:25.639 --> 32:27.684
while having an amazing family,
you know?

32:29.338 --> 32:30.818
- Soon.
- Are you excited?

32:30.861 --> 32:32.124
- Yes, obviously.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.734
- How is it that I'm more
excited than you are?

32:33.777 --> 32:37.477
- No. I'm very excited.
- All right.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.000
- I just feel so overwhelmed
right now.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.829
There's so many things
happening and so many changes.

It's a lot.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.882
Adulting is hard.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.667
- And when we look back,
we'll enjoy these moments,

32:53.710 --> 32:55.625
because although it's gonna
be amazing having a family,

32:55.669 --> 32:57.497
it's also pretty awesome
just having the two of us.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.020
- Yes.

I can't take this face.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.463
you take what God gives you.
- No. I know.

33:50.506 --> 33:51.855
But I would love

33:51.899 --> 33:54.206

34:01.474 --> 34:04.477
just gonna
have to, I don't know.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.131
- I think you'll be able
to balance it though.

34:06.174 --> 34:08.872
Like, when I first got married
I worked,

34:08.916 --> 34:12.789
and then when I had you I took
care of you, and that was it.

34:13.616 --> 34:16.706
You know, the man was the one
that was the breadwinner,

34:16.750 --> 34:18.186
and then, years later,

34:18.230 --> 34:20.188
you know, I had my store,
and then I worked.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.973
And then I continued to work.

34:23.017 --> 34:26.064
But nowadays, it's changed.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.414
<i>- My mom actually did sign

34:28.457 --> 34:30.720

34:30.764 --> 34:32.418
So she was supposed
to be a pop singer,

34:32.461 --> 34:34.550

34:48.564 --> 34:50.697
I don't know.
You don't think it's weird?

34:50.740 --> 34:52.177
- No.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.395
- People are gonna be, like,
judgmental and be like,

34:53.439 --> 34:54.918
"Oh, like, she's there."

34:54.962 --> 34:57.138
- Do people feel like that
about J-Lo?

34:57.182 --> 34:58.444
- No.

34:58.487 --> 34:59.923
- Do they feel like
that about some

34:59.967 --> 35:02.187
of the most beautiful, sexy
women in the world?

35:02.230 --> 35:03.318
- Yeah. Remember in the media?

35:03.362 --> 35:04.624
- Look, you can't do it
every night.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.408
- They've done it
so many times to girls

35:06.452 --> 35:07.801
when they've had kids,

35:07.844 --> 35:09.455
and I've seen that a lot.

35:09.498 --> 35:12.153
- Look, you pick and choose
what you want.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.459
You've got so many businesses.

35:13.502 --> 35:14.808

35:14.851 --> 35:16.201

35:16.244 --> 35:17.767
- And you've gotta
pay attention to that,

35:17.811 --> 35:20.466
and you've gotta travel,
and you've gotta promote.

35:20.509 --> 35:23.556
And you know, babies--
you take them with you.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.253
I believe in taking kids
with you,

35:25.297 --> 35:26.602
as long as you can.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.517
We took you all everywhere.

35:28.561 --> 35:31.129
- I just don't know if I would
want my kids to travel

35:31.172 --> 35:32.347
as much as I do.

35:32.391 --> 35:33.740
It's a lot.

35:33.783 --> 35:35.481
- Well...
- I was traveling--

35:35.524 --> 35:37.352
- Until they're three or four--
- 250 days a year before.

35:37.396 --> 35:38.788
- I understand that.
- That's a lot.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.095
- But you just have to have
the balance,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.966
and I think you can do it.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.187
Look, you know,
you're very lucky

35:46.231 --> 35:48.058
that you have the freedom
that you do.

35:48.102 --> 35:52.019
Like, me working, you know,
on my show this year.

35:52.062 --> 35:55.805
This is the first time
I went on two girls' trips,

35:55.849 --> 35:59.505
and then going and doing
"Watch What Happens Live."

35:59.548 --> 36:02.682
Those are, like, the only times
I've been away from Dad.

36:02.725 --> 36:06.338
And so, to me, that's freedom.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.602
- I think my mom spent
so much of her life

36:09.645 --> 36:12.561
worrying about other
people's opinions

36:12.605 --> 36:16.522
and trying to portray
this perfect life.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.524
- I feel like maybe,
because all the kids

36:18.567 --> 36:21.048
are grown up now
and out of the house,

36:21.091 --> 36:24.356
so now she can be a kid again.
- She just wants to enjoy life.

36:24.399 --> 36:25.879
- And she didn't really get
to be a kid,

36:25.922 --> 36:30.057
because, like, meeting Dad
at 15, then having me--

36:30.100 --> 36:31.841
- She was a kid.
- She was a kid.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.930
<i>Imagine having a kid at 19,
so, like,</i>

36:33.974 --> 36:35.845
<i>she kind of maybe lost--</i>

36:35.889 --> 36:37.369
- Missed her childhood.
- Yes.

36:37.412 --> 36:38.979
- So she's living it. Yeah.

36:39.022 --> 36:41.721
She's living it now.
She's living it up.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.940
- I think we're good,
and Dad and I

36:43.984 --> 36:47.901
are right down the street,
and we support you and Carter.

36:47.944 --> 36:52.035
- Thank you. It means a lot.
Love you.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.255
- Love you, honey, and I love
these little doggies.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.996
- Me too. Where is Ether?

36:56.039 --> 36:57.476
- Ether, where are you?

36:57.519 --> 37:00.043
Look at this one. It's like...
- He's my best friend.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.610
- You've gotta give him
more attention.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.699
- This one gets more attention
than anyone.

37:03.743 --> 37:06.006
- I thought I was
your best friend.

37:06.049 --> 37:08.617
- You're my best human friend.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.272
- Aw. She's so sweet.

37:11.316 --> 37:15.494
- Ether? Where is he?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.757
I hope I don't lose my kids
one day, like this.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.325
- Stop it, you don't even
talk like that.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.631
Ether? Ether?

37:22.675 --> 37:25.504
Where are you?
- He's probably in the kitchen.

37:25.547 --> 37:28.289
- Ether.
Why is he running away from me?

37:28.333 --> 37:29.812
Come here.
