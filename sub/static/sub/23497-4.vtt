You worried about your
university interview tomorrow?

00:38.956 --> 00:40.498
It's SoCalArt.

00:40.583 --> 00:43.460
They only accept, like,
40 people each year.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.503
-What if I mess up?
-You'll do great. You always do.

00:45.588 --> 00:49.091
But hey, maybe I'll move to Cali
to be near you and your sister.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.300
Hashtag, goals, right?

00:50.383 --> 00:52.636
Okay.
Thanks, Mom.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.640
- Now, get some rest, okay?
- Yeah.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.369
While no fatalities have been reported,

01:17.452 --> 01:19.622
a number of students
are being rushed to hospital,

01:19.705 --> 01:22.040
at least one in critical condition.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.990
- Good, you're up.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.408
I'm turning it off.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.786
Get dressed
and come get breakfast.

01:58.869 --> 01:59.912
Breakfast?

01:59.995 --> 02:03.040

02:42.287 --> 02:44.790
- Oh, ten points.
- Mmm.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.500
Yeah.
Yeah, perfect,

02:47.584 --> 02:50.796
and then you use the other cars
to measure how far back you are.

02:51.839 --> 02:56.634
Yeah. Perfect girlfriend and pretty soon,
perfect chauffeur.

02:56.719 --> 02:59.512
-I scored huge.
-And don't you forget it.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.809
One more driving lesson, though?
At lunch?

03:03.892 --> 03:07.437
Oh. Oh, you didn't get enough practice
on our road trip last year?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.522
- Ha-ha.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.024
So what you're saying is I shouldn't even
have to take this test, right?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.736
-Oh, you're the expert. I don't know.
-Please? My road test is tonight.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.403
Frankie, I'd love to help, but--

03:15.487 --> 03:19.532
I know, I know. You already skipped
play auditions to help me now.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.577
What's funny?

03:22.660 --> 03:24.246
Oh, uh, it's just something Grace said.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.998
Well, can I see it?

03:26.706 --> 03:28.000
Uh, not without a warrant.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.918
Uh, I got your warrant right here.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.505
Hey, what the hell, Frankie?

03:36.008 --> 03:38.385
--I thought we were joking around.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.845
Yeah, no, it's fine.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.265
Wanna head in?

03:44.016 --> 03:45.225
Yeah, sure.

03:55.568 --> 03:59.406
Hello, my name is Rasha Zuabi,
and I'm reading for the role of Hero.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.450
You're auditioning for the lead?

04:02.534 --> 04:03.869
Yes. Should I begin?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.746
- I...
- Yeah.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.039
By all means.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.295
"I was waiting for you
when I heard about the crash.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.504
We were supposed to grab dinner."

04:17.174 --> 04:19.217
Um...
Should I stop?

04:19.301 --> 04:23.096
No.
Sorry, you're doing fine.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.472
"But you never showed.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.018
You were here, in this bed,
three months and a day.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.187
And every day,
I've been here, talking to you.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.479
But can you hear me?

04:31.563 --> 04:33.816
Are you ever going to come back to me?"

04:38.904 --> 04:41.073
Was that okay?
Should I try it differently?

04:41.156 --> 04:42.532
No, that was...
That was fine.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.326
We'll be in touch.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.621
I can't wait for you
to drive me everywhere.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.165
California, here we come!

04:51.083 --> 04:54.211
So now you don't like California?
I can't keep up with you.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.421
Can boys and girls be just friends?

04:56.504 --> 04:57.547
-No.
-Yes.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.966
- That's helpful.
- Okay. Don't listen to Shay.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.885
The last time she was just friends
with a boy, Tiny fell in love with her.

05:01.969 --> 05:02.970
Yeah.
That's one example.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.430
But think of all the boys you're
friends with. Hunter, Vijay, Baaz.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.057
They don't count, okay?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.601
One's gay. One's your brother.
And one's Baaz.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.979
-Well, why doesn't Baaz count?
-Because I'm way out of his league.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.773
Okay. So if a straight boy
and girl are of similar hotness,

05:15.858 --> 05:19.236
and spend a lot of time together,
sooner or later, one of them has a crush?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.363
Usually the boy.
It's just biology.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.655
Must have missed that chapter.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.575
Jonah got a message from Grace,
and when I tried to see it, he freaked.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.995
Should I be worried?
I mean...

05:28.078 --> 05:30.622
obviously he's hot,
and they kinda dress the same,

05:30.705 --> 05:32.165
and they like the same stuff.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.418
Oh, my God.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.836
Are they a good match?

05:41.591 --> 05:42.759
Maya?

05:42.842 --> 05:44.344
-Mmm?
-Maya.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.846
-Did I...
-Doze off? Big time.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.223
Up late practicing for SoCalArt?

05:49.807 --> 05:51.018
Do you ever think about death?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.853
As someone with a fatal genetic disease,
yes, I do think about it.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.480
- Thanks for bringing it up.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.065
Uh, can we talk?
Play business.

05:57.149 --> 06:01.069
I was up all night, and I saw a video
of a girl our age getting hanged.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.738
Why her? Why not us?

06:03.822 --> 06:05.365
Because we're lucky we live here?

06:05.448 --> 06:06.741
--Um, so,

06:06.824 --> 06:08.410
Jonah and I talked
to student council the other day--

06:08.493 --> 06:09.619
Hey, that creep just took a picture of us.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.371
- I'm trying to talk to you.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.123
He just did it again.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.207
Hey.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.668
Creep.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.797
Give it back.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.674
You can't just take
photos of people without--

06:27.470 --> 06:29.306
Who are these people?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.893
Did you know them?
Is this Syria?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.565
Douma.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.192
Near Damascus.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.944
What happened?

06:42.027 --> 06:46.156
When they came,
everyone was separated.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.868
Men were shot.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.870
Women and girls were taken.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.916
People were dying all around me.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.421
People keep dying around me, too.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.342
I guess we're the lucky ones.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.928
At least that's what everybody
keeps telling me.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.684
I was nervous at first,
but then the words just flowed out of me.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.644
--That's amazing.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.146
And the play is so beautiful.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.108
It's about a girl named Hero,
who has a boyfriend in a coma,

07:21.191 --> 07:22.484
and she's so worried
that he'll never wake up.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.860
But in the end, he does.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.030
I'm pretty sure Hero is a boy.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.075
In love with another boy?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.326
They're gay.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.662
Hero is based on Miles.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.291
That's why he laughed.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.917
Does this mean I can't get the part?

07:40.002 --> 07:41.919
It was a long shot, anyway.

07:42.004 --> 07:45.215
There are only three roles in the play
and a lot of people wanted to be in it.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.426
But why would he let me audition
for the wrong role?

07:55.933 --> 07:58.520
This is where I was supposed
to meet my boyfriend,

07:58.603 --> 07:59.896
but he never showed up.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.483
What happened to him?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.069
He, um...

08:07.154 --> 08:09.614
He killed himself.
They never told me how.

08:14.744 --> 08:18.165
Then my bandmate got in
this texting-and-driving accident.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.211
Then there was the bus crash.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.108
When I went to visit Tristan
in the hospital...

08:47.194 --> 08:48.778
all I could think was that...

08:50.822 --> 08:54.034
he was there... because I exist.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.331
How did he look after the crash?

09:00.332 --> 09:01.416
He was...

09:02.500 --> 09:04.044
We were upside down.
He was...

09:05.170 --> 09:09.257
sort of twisted in on himself.
Sort of like this.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.435
Hold your hair back.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.190
Relax your hand.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.125
Oh, crap! Crap!

09:52.425 --> 09:53.968
Hey.

09:54.051 --> 09:58.181
Um, would you be able to
hack into Jonah's messages for me?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.475
Well, by court order, I have to say no.

10:01.058 --> 10:05.397
But... if he's ever used our Wi-Fi
at home, I have his password.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.151
I installed a key logger at home
when Mom was e-mailing my doctors.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.777
--Can I have it?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.654
Jonah's messages are private, though.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.197
Yeah, Yael's right.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.907
With great power
comes great responsibility.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.659
-You owe me.
-Wha... For what?

10:17.742 --> 10:19.076
For not eating you
when we were in the womb.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.954
Dark.
Okay, I like it.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.873
That earns you one password.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.668
How would you feel if Jonah read through
your private messages?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.296
I'm just trying to make sure
that he's not cheating on me,

10:29.379 --> 10:31.464
or lying, or totally in love
with his best friend.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.341
That's not how trust works.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.052
Wait...

10:36.136 --> 10:37.637
Have you read through my messages?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.431
Of course not.
I trust you.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.226
--There's your password.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.230
I trust Jonah.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.732
Well, then you have nothing
to worry about, right?

10:50.608 --> 10:54.571

10:55.238 --> 10:59.951

You really have a way with words.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.443
Thanks.
Music's always been a part of my life.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.944
I can see that.

11:35.027 --> 11:39.616
Junior orchestra, several bands,
and quite a bit of songwriting.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.033
But not since last April?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.495
- Yeah.
- Um...

11:43.578 --> 11:45.997
I... I was in a bus crash
at the end of last year.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.582
It... broke my wrists.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.713
-Have you been writing about it?
-Not really. Um...

11:53.796 --> 11:56.716
I've just been a bit blocked lately.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.887
At SoCalArt, you'll be expected
to write through the writer's block.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.014
Of course.
I didn't mean that...

12:03.097 --> 12:05.392
- That won't be a problem.
- I hope not.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.435
You're... you're very talented, Maya,

12:07.519 --> 12:11.314
but to be a great songwriter,
you have to keep writing.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.816
Hmm.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.614
Immature?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.663
- Ready for your driving exam?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.498
Good. Let's get started.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.172
- Oh!

13:19.298 --> 13:22.009
I am so sorry. Um...

13:23.345 --> 13:25.221
Is there any way I can start again?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.353
Is Hero based on you?

13:33.771 --> 13:34.814
I guess so.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.651
-Therefore, Hero is a boy?
-Well, I prefer "man," but sure.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.277
So you let me audition
for a boy character?

13:41.904 --> 13:44.949
Look, I didn't want to embarrass you.
Okay, you've clearly been through a lot--

13:45.032 --> 13:47.410
I didn't escape the firing squads
so I could be treated like an idiot.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.495
Look, I was just trying to be nice.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.621
You know what would have been nice?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.414
Telling me
so I could audition for the right role.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.333
Okay, then do that.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.586
-Do what?
-Audition for Hope.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.087
The female lead.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.714
We're doing another session today.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.258
How am I supposed to learn

14:02.341 --> 14:03.968
a whole new set of lines
by this afternoon?

14:04.051 --> 14:06.471
Look, you said you didn't want
to be treated differently.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.981
You read his messages?

14:17.064 --> 14:19.233
Okay. As soon as I had his password,
it was like,

14:19.316 --> 14:21.361
"Yeah, I knew I shouldn't,
but I had to know,"

14:21.444 --> 14:23.446
and then I was like,
"Do you really want to know?"

14:23.530 --> 14:24.906
So then I really, I almost...

14:24.989 --> 14:26.866
I almost didn't.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.493
But then I did.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.579
And now I have to tell him, don't I?

14:31.663 --> 14:32.872
Yeah, that'll go over well.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.042
Well, how am I supposed to fix,
you know, "immature"?

14:36.125 --> 14:38.753
I mean, is it the way I dress?
The stuff I say?

14:38.836 --> 14:40.463
- Is it the way I act?
- Okay.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.508
When boys say "immature,"
they mean one thing.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.976
Are you actually considering it?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.853
I don't know.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.647
I've thought about it, but...

14:57.730 --> 14:59.190
I can't really do that, can I?

14:59.273 --> 15:02.026
Well, if you have to ask,
the answer is probably no.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.948
When Jonah and I are together...

15:07.865 --> 15:09.617
we just kinda fit.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.327
And I haven't really felt that
with anyone else.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.539
But...
when are you together?

15:14.622 --> 15:15.957
Isn't he always busy with the play?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.838
I just need to convince him
to take a little break.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.713
-Jonah!
-Huh?

16:04.714 --> 16:05.798
Hey.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.764
-Well, hello to you, too.
-I hope you're free tonight.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.932
Are these tickets to the Anti-Flag show?

16:15.016 --> 16:18.144
I mean, they're more of a gift for me,
but, um... you can tag along.

16:18.227 --> 16:22.189
-You like Anti-Flag?
-Yeah. They say some really smart stuff.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.276
- Do you not?
- Yeah. No. I just...

16:25.359 --> 16:29.113
I never thought you liked anarchy so much,
mayor's daughter.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.783
Well, yeah.
I... I, um...

16:31.866 --> 16:33.618
I like different songs of... of theirs.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.202
- Mmm.
- Like the anti-capitalist ones?

16:37.955 --> 16:40.124
-We should go set up.
-Yeah, I'll be there in a sec.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.004
Frankie,
I have play auditions tonight.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.506
We'll talk later?

16:51.511 --> 16:54.388
I'm never going to be Hope.
She's a fantasy and I'm not.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.473
I wanted to be Hero

16:55.556 --> 16:56.807
- because I relate to him.
- Thank you very much.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.475
I feel his pain.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.939
So why shouldn't you get a boy part?

17:04.231 --> 17:05.650
Rasha, you ready?

17:09.612 --> 17:10.697
Yes.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.657
I'm ready to audition
for the role of Hero.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.283
Look, we talked about this.

17:14.366 --> 17:18.037
Hero's based on my experiences,
right? As a boy.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.206
But the feelings Hero has
aren't exclusive to boys.

17:24.168 --> 17:27.504
I haven't heard back
from my best friend since I left Syria.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.928
I'm not sure if she's okay, or hurt,
or...

17:35.471 --> 17:38.307
Shouldn't someone who deeply understands
the material play the part?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.684
All right.

17:40.852 --> 17:41.853
You can audition again.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.855
If you're right for it, we'll talk.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.066
But if not, that's it. Fair?

17:47.149 --> 17:48.275
Fair.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.327
This is him.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.041
He looks peaceful.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.628
I wanna look like that.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.312
Ever since the crash...

18:25.396 --> 18:26.689
I've felt numb.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.527
And I thought if I just kept smiling,
I'd feel better.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.946
But I didn't...

18:35.031 --> 18:36.282
until I saw your photos.

18:37.700 --> 18:41.120
They make me feel something
and I just want to keep feeling.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.123
That's why I need you to take more...

18:45.124 --> 18:46.125
with me.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.044
Now.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.221
We should do this before a nurse comes.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.145
- I got it done in Syria.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.271
I just thought, you know,

19:07.354 --> 19:08.355
- why not have a change?
- Oh.

19:09.732 --> 19:10.942
Uh...

19:12.652 --> 19:14.070
- He looks happy.
- Is that good?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.571
- Mmm.
- Do you think I got the part?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.573
- Okay, he's almost here.
- Act normal.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.283
Hey, Rasha?

19:20.617 --> 19:22.829
Oh, hi, Miles.
I didn't see you.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.748
So, I was thinking about what you said.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.918
That someone who understands
the material should play Hero.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.253
Did you have someone in mind?

19:31.337 --> 19:33.130
Yeah, actually. Um...

19:33.965 --> 19:35.091
Me.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.761
Because no one understands what
I'm going through better than me, right?

19:38.845 --> 19:41.430
No, I suppose not.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.015
But I really liked your audition.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.309
So you're going to be Coma Boy.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.478
And don't worry, it does have lines.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.814
So, rehearsal's at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.734
Who actually, um,
approves the rehearsal times?

19:52.817 --> 19:54.026
- Oh, that's me!
- Okay.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.574
You okay?

20:02.118 --> 20:03.410
I'm in the play.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.997
- I'm in the play.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.129
My bad.
Uh... personal space, or whatever.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.964
- I... I don't mind.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.218
Do you wanna... grab coffee?

20:20.136 --> 20:21.387
That'd be nice.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.227
You're better off without him, okay?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.104
I mean,
what was he thinking with those Xs?

20:30.187 --> 20:32.481
Tic-tac-toe hasn't been cool
since grade five.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.318
Can I have a minute?

20:49.331 --> 20:50.541
Frankie...

20:51.583 --> 20:55.712
I have been under a lot of pressure
trying to figure out my future.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.342
And with the... the play, it's...

21:00.426 --> 21:03.512
it's a really big deal
for college applications.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.766
I understand.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.394
But I feel really lucky to have you.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.106
You're my rock.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.861
Even though sometimes I can be...

21:19.862 --> 21:20.905
immature?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.240
Frankie,
I like you exactly the way you are.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.576
Forgive me?

21:25.659 --> 21:27.995
- Of course. Yeah.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.455
Good, then...

21:29.538 --> 21:32.333
what do you say
we go get some ice cream for lunch?

21:32.416 --> 21:34.251
I'd like that.
A lot.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.087
Good. 'Cause you're driving.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.173
Gotta practice
if you're gonna pass your next test.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.388
- Can I meet you in your car?

21:50.434 --> 21:51.643
Do you still have that condom?

21:58.609 --> 21:59.693
Thank you.

22:07.618 --> 22:10.454
- Hey, Grace.
- Hey, Maya. Can we talk?

22:10.537 --> 22:11.788
Oh, about the play.
Yes.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.083
I'm sorry.
I've been so busy with everything lately.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.418
That's... what I wanted to talk
to you about.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.254
You're off the hook.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.630
What do you mean?

22:19.713 --> 22:22.842
Me and Jonah are working on the play
with Miles...

22:23.759 --> 22:25.177
instead of you?

22:26.303 --> 22:27.304
Are we still cool?

22:27.388 --> 22:30.724
If... if you want,
we can find you another job on it.

22:30.807 --> 22:31.850
Um...

22:32.851 --> 22:34.061
It's okay.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.981
I think I found something else anyway.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.275
See you at school.
