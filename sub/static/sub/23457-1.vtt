01:07.442 --> 01:10.946
<i>In 1964,
I was a young writer living in Paris.</i>

01:11.196 --> 01:13.991
<i>I had written a few articles
about Alberto Giacometti,</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:17.578
<i>who was one of the most accomplished
and respected artists of his generation.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:21.748
<i>I had become good friends with Giacometti
and his brother, Diego.</i>

01:21.832 --> 01:24.668
<i>And one day, after an exhibition,
he asked me to sit for a portrait.</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:28.255
<i>He told me it would take no longer
than two to three hours.</i>

01:28.964 --> 01:31.383
<i>An afternoon at the most.</i>

01:43.562 --> 01:45.897
Oh, the exhibition was just beautiful.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.900
I don't think he's ever really happy.

01:48.984 --> 01:51.028
Uh, but he asked me to pose for him.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.531
Yes, exactly,
then I'll be back in a few...

01:55.532 --> 01:58.285
Yeah.
Oh, he said it'd be very quick.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.101
Excuse me.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.811
Okay.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.192
Ah, hello, Jim!

03:12.275 --> 03:13.568
Hello, Annette. How's it going?

03:13.652 --> 03:15.904
- It's going well. And you?
- Good thanks, very good

03:24.246 --> 03:27.457
Okay. I'm going to Le Dome.
Would you like to join me?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.084
I would,
but we're about to start...

03:29.167 --> 03:31.670
- Ah, yes, you're my husband's next victim.
- Mm.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.171
- Have fun.
- Enjoy your lunch.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.756
Okay, is it too small...?

05:03.094 --> 05:04.888
- Ah, Jim.
- Diego. Hello.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.474
- I heard you were coming.
- How's it going?

05:07.557 --> 05:10.101
Ah, I'm okay, okay.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.479
- What's this?
- I just made this base.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.482
But, uh, it might be a little, uh...

05:18.068 --> 05:20.821
Yes.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.609
Whew.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.869
It's hopeless.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.767
Okay.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.899
No.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.671
You have the head of a brute.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.843
- Gee, thanks.
- Yeah. You look like a real thug.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.053
Thank you.

08:33.596 --> 08:37.767
If I was to paint you as I see you now
and a policeman was to see this painting,

08:38.434 --> 08:40.687
you'd be thrown in jail, like that.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.398
- Perhaps we shouldn't continue.
- No, no, no.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.235
It's all right. I'll never be able
to paint you as I see you.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.821
- Are you sure?
- Yes, of course.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.449
It's impossible.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.428
<i>Just so you know, it is also
impossible to ever finish a portrait.</i>

10:38.388 --> 10:39.722
<i>What do you mean?</i>

10:39.806 --> 10:43.101
<i>Well, portraits used to be finished.</i>

10:43.977 --> 10:45.228
<i>They had to be.</i>

10:46.563 --> 10:51.025
<i>They were necessary.
It was a substitute for a photograph.</i>

10:52.944 --> 10:56.197
<i>Now, portraits have no meaning.</i>

10:59.033 --> 11:00.827
<i>So, what we're doing is meaningless?</i>

11:00.910 --> 11:03.496
<i>Mm. And impossible.</i>

11:05.540 --> 11:08.710
<i>And I'm not even doing it.
I can only ever try to do it.</i>

11:17.218 --> 11:21.097
So on that note,
shall we stop for the day?

11:30.064 --> 11:34.527
- Pff. It's a start.
- Yes. Yeah, yeah. Um, uh...

11:34.611 --> 11:37.322
It's not done yet.
You can come back tomorrow, right?

11:37.405 --> 11:40.450
- Sure, sure, but I... I have the...
- Good. You have what?

11:40.533 --> 11:43.494
I've got the flight the next day
is the only thing.

11:43.578 --> 11:46.873
- Oh, that's fine.
- That gives us enough time?

11:46.956 --> 11:50.627
- Yes.
- All right, sure. So same time tomorrow?

11:50.710 --> 11:54.047
- Sure, sure. Thank you.
- No, no, thank you.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.762
Well, we'll see if you thank me tomorrow
after I torture you some more.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.722
You've made progress.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.767
I don't know
if "progress" is the right word.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.852
- What's the right word?
- Shitty!

12:22.825 --> 12:27.664
- Caroline, you know James?
- James, no. Ah, James.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.499
- Yes, nice to see you.
- Hello, James.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.418
- Uh, so, Alberto, I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yes. Good, good.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.587
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.880
- He is still here.
- Come on.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.132
Does he not want to leave?

12:38.216 --> 12:39.384
Hang on.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.061
And there!
Again. Again, again, again, again. Again.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.737
Go on, now.

13:10.373 --> 13:14.043
<i>Each night, after working with me,
Giacometti would work with Caroline,</i>

13:14.127 --> 13:17.213
<i>a prostitute with whom he'd been
openly carrying on a relationship</i>

13:17.296 --> 13:19.340
<i>for three years.</i>

13:19.424 --> 13:20.883
Are you done?

13:22.093 --> 13:24.721
<i>She'd become his primary model,</i>

13:24.804 --> 13:27.807
<i>his nighttime companion...</i>

13:27.890 --> 13:30.018
<i>and his obsession.</i>

15:10.952 --> 15:13.621
- I have to say, I will miss Paris as well.
- Yeah.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.914
Mm.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.666
- Excuse me. I'll see you in a minute.
- Hello, James.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.875
- Hello, Pierre.
- James.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.544
- How's it going?
- I saw the portrait.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.130
- Oh, and?
- Well...

15:22.213 --> 15:24.215
Pierre thinks
he'll never be able to sell it.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.635
It's more to do with the subject
than the painting.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.887
Anyway,
I'm not going to give it to you, Pierre.

15:29.971 --> 15:32.807
- I'm going to give it to Lord.
- And rightly so.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.310
It's coming along superbly.
It could be your best.

15:36.394 --> 15:39.313
Oh, now you say that,
I'm probably going to wreck it.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.360
- You take a coffee?
- I would love one, thank you.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.989
- No, we have to go back to work.
- Oh.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.615
- Nice to see you, Pierre.
- It's a shame.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.704
Have a nice day.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.054
What are you doing?

16:12.722 --> 16:13.556
Do you mind?

16:56.933 --> 17:00.645
Oh, fuck!

17:00.728 --> 17:02.396
Don't know how to do anything.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.067
Wait. You can stay, right?

17:06.858 --> 17:10.445
- I was supposed to leave tomorrow.
- Oh.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.866
No, but I could...
Another day or...?

17:13.950 --> 17:18.496
A day or two at the most, and then
if it doesn't turn out to be any good,

17:18.579 --> 17:21.415
I can give up painting forever.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.792
- Don't laugh.
- Sorry.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.423
Have you always been like this?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.843
- Like what?
- So doubtful of your own ability.

17:32.927 --> 17:36.806
Of course. It gets worse every year.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.058
But you become more successful every year.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.186
What better breeding ground
for doubt than success?

17:42.270 --> 17:43.312
Hmm?

17:44.146 --> 17:46.148
- Don't smile.
- Well, you did.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.608
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.151
I did not smile.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.081
Oh, fuck!

18:03.708 --> 18:07.086
This is going really badly. Hmm.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.922
There's no question
of finishing it, so...

18:10.381 --> 18:12.592
- Then why are we here?
- What?

18:13.259 --> 18:16.345
- I... I said, then why are we here?
- It's useful for me.

18:17.013 --> 18:22.101
It's what I deserve, I suppose,
after 35 years of dishonesty.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.854
That's what I am. I'm dishonest.
I'm a... I'm a liar.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.606
Dishonesty? How do you mean?

18:26.689 --> 18:28.774
All these years
that I've been showing things.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.110
They were all... they were all unfinished.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.740
Probably shouldn't have been started
in the first place.

18:36.991 --> 18:40.620
Then again, if I hadn't shown them,
I would have felt like a coward, so...

18:40.703 --> 18:43.331
Ugh! I don't know. I'm neurotic.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.249
Well, I understand that.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.086
I had a friend who was so neurotic,
he ended up committing suicide.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.425
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.510
Do you ever think about it?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.846
- Suicide?
- Mm.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.265
Every day. Of course.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.311
It's not like I feel life is bad.
It's just that I...

19:06.812 --> 19:10.107
I think death must be the most fascinating
experience, you know?

19:11.108 --> 19:14.028
I'm just... I'm just curious.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.786
The best way would be
to cut one's throat from ear to ear.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.204
Hmm.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.289
I don't know
if I'd have the courage to do that.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.086
You can take sleeping pills,
but that's not really suicide, is it?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.587
That's just...

19:31.671 --> 19:33.047
that's just sleeping.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.885
Cutting your wrists is nothing.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.807
The one that really appeals to me
is burning yourself alive.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.144
That would be something.
That I would really like to do.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.771
Well, do it or shut up.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.147
- I might.
- Oh, my God.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.192
I might, so I don't have to listen to you
talk about it anymore.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.903
- Please do it.
- I would.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.198
The only problem is,
you can only do it once.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.214
- Jesus!
- What? It's only a million.

20:15.297 --> 20:19.719
<i>- Due. Two million.
- Well, there's some for you.</i>

20:19.802 --> 20:22.888
- Oh.
- A little for me.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.061
And the rest, I'll keep... boff!

20:30.187 --> 20:33.482
- Oh, God. What a ham.
- What?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.109
I thought you were without affectation.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.319
- Was that affected?
- A little bit.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.405
- Yeah, but it was funny.
- True.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.074
I have several million hidden in here.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.410
- Where?
- Pff. That's the problem.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.662
It's so fucking well hidden,
I don't know where it is.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.789
Why on earth would you hide
two million more?

20:48.873 --> 20:52.084
- What else could I do with it?
- You put it in the bank.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.588
- Oh, no. Can't trust banks.
- Can't trust banks. No.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.132
You're Swiss.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.093
No. Swiss Italian.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.096
Oh, for God's sakes.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.558
Under the bed is not such a great idea.
What do you think?

21:07.641 --> 21:10.895
- I think it's fairly obvious.
- But I want to be able to find it again.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.605
Uh...

21:14.356 --> 21:15.483
How about under the dresser?

21:15.566 --> 21:16.442
Ooh.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.778
- I could tape it to the bottom.
- You could.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.246
- Will I remember that?
- I don't know.

21:31.415 --> 21:35.419
How about up here on the beam?
Here, you do it. You're taller.

21:41.509 --> 21:42.676
Just right up there?

21:52.645 --> 21:53.646
What do you think?

21:54.730 --> 21:57.358
I can still see it.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.484
Bring it down again.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.702
Let's see.
There must be somewhere here.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.551
Well, it could...
I think it'll be just a few days longer.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.346
Of course, I miss you too, but...

22:27.429 --> 22:30.641
I do. Oh, stop it.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.228
Listen, I think it's important.
I want him to finish.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.565
- No...
- I hid it in the toilet.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.858
Not in. Up.

22:43.195 --> 22:48.450
Oh, um, never mind.
Uh... I... I can't rush him. It's...

22:49.326 --> 22:53.414
I don't know how, first of all.
It'll only be a few more days.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.883
So, let's make the trade.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.177
I would like to take back
the four earlier ones of mine.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.679
- Oh, yes. Yes. The watercolors.
- Mm-hm.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.597
I love those.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.515
Yes, we love these.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.892
- And did you bring the nude?
- Sorry?

23:13.976 --> 23:14.810
The nude.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.645
I can take it off your hands.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.649
Tsk. Uh, yes.
Uh, fine, good, yes. Um, absolutely.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.278
- There we are.
- Ah, yes.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.406
- And you can have these three.
- Yes.

23:28.365 --> 23:33.203
Uh, oh, and this one, which I love.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.582
- Yes. Oh, yes. Wonderful.
- All right.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.751
- All right.
- Yes, perfect. Wonderful.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.461
- Perfect.
- Oh, yes.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.671
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.714
Enchanted.

23:44.715 --> 23:48.135
Ah. The desire, look at that.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.475
Hmm.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.354
How'd it go?

23:59.355 --> 24:01.106
He made out like a capitalist.

24:02.232 --> 24:07.321
I haven't seen these for such a long time.
I don't have many of these.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.115
This nude is...

24:11.200 --> 24:15.871
<i>the last time I did one from life in 1935.</i>

24:17.665 --> 24:18.666
So, what did you give them?

24:18.749 --> 24:21.251
Drawings that were like hundreds
of others he's done.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.128
And they were happy?

24:23.212 --> 24:25.047
Happy? Of course they were.

24:25.130 --> 24:29.176
They know those are what sells.
Those are "Giacomettis"!

24:30.260 --> 24:31.762
And those?

24:31.845 --> 24:34.682
Do these look like "Giacomettis" to you?

24:45.776 --> 24:49.863
Front on, you look like a brute.
Side on, you look like a degenerate.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.493
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.663
One way you go to jail.
The other, you go straight to the asylum.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.418
I'll probably meet you in there.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.424
Oh, God.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.250
Okay, let's go.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.003
- You moved.
- No, I didn't.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.296
- Yes, you did.
- No.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.339
Lower your chin.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.966
A little to the right.

26:34.676 --> 26:35.677
Not so far.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.766
Raise your head very slowly. There.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.977
I don't know why you try to trick me.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.188
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.483
- There. Stay there.
- Hmm.

27:01.203 --> 27:04.039
Oh, fuck!

27:20.639 --> 27:23.433
Is it worth going on with?

27:24.351 --> 27:26.395
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.233
A real friend would tell me
that I should give up painting forever.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.735
Whoever said I was a real friend?

27:35.654 --> 27:38.198
Are we ready?

27:38.282 --> 27:39.700
- I'm starving.
- Oh, of course.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.368
- Let's go.
- Ah.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.286
- Good.
- Let's go.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.204
Thank you. I can't wait anymore.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.046
Okay, okay.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.424
"There once was a young man from Ghent...

27:55.507 --> 27:57.217
- Not this one, Alberto.
- No, please.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.344
- It's horrible.
- Let me tell it.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.388
- Don't say this one.
- Let me do this. Okay.

28:01.471 --> 28:05.183
"Young man from Ghent, whose cock was..."
no, no, no, it was his tool.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.103
"Whose tool was so long, it was bent.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.606
To save her the trouble,
He folded it double

28:10.689 --> 28:13.901
And instead of coming, he went."

28:13.984 --> 28:16.278
That's terrible.
Why would you let him tell that?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.780
Oh, let's have more wine. Alphonse?

28:18.864 --> 28:20.574
- More wine!
- Hey, excuse me.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.784
<i>- Where did you learn...?
- The pissoir is calling.</i>

28:24.369 --> 28:27.205
Hmm. So, how is it going?

28:28.373 --> 28:30.250
- It's going well, I think.
- Yeah?

28:30.334 --> 28:32.252
- Yeah.
- How do you like posing?

28:32.336 --> 28:33.962
- I like it. I do.
- Yeah?

28:34.046 --> 28:37.132
Yeah, but it's, you know,
it can be exhausting.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.301
- Yeah, I know.
- He makes me nervous sometimes.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.970
The way he yells at the canvas
when things aren't going well...

28:42.054 --> 28:43.513
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

28:43.597 --> 28:46.516
But what's really disturbing
is just how the portrait itself

28:46.600 --> 28:50.270
seems to come and go as if Alberto
has no control over it whatsoever.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.688
I know.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.733
- Then other times, it just...
- disappears entirely.

28:54.816 --> 28:55.734
Yeah.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.612
I feel like this could go on for months.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.408
- Sometimes it does.
- There's nothing anyone can do about it?

29:03.492 --> 29:05.911
- No.
- Even Alberto?

29:06.745 --> 29:08.330
Especially Alberto.

29:09.122 --> 29:14.962
It's... it's a terrible feeling
of fatality, isn't it?

29:17.673 --> 29:18.966
You'll get used to it.

29:28.016 --> 29:28.850
Ahem.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.311
Shall we get a little more wine?

29:31.728 --> 29:32.980
- We did.
- Did we? Uh...

29:33.063 --> 29:35.148
- Yeah.
- You know, I'll... I'll check on it.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.149
Excuse me.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.986
Oh, Alberto.

30:11.059 --> 30:11.893
Hello!

30:16.440 --> 30:17.566
What time is it?

30:18.859 --> 30:21.111
- 2:30.
- Shit. Already?

30:22.154 --> 30:24.990
I wanted to get something to drink
before we started.

30:25.741 --> 30:26.783
All right.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.910
You wanna go, uh...?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.261
Okay, okay.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.097
Let's go.

31:01.151 --> 31:02.402
Okay, okay.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.969
Mm.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.560
We'll get some eggs and some wine.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.230
- Oh, I'll get my cigarettes.
- Oh, I have mine if you...

31:41.316 --> 31:42.567
Okay, we go.

31:57.791 --> 32:01.378
- No, let's work. Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.729
Yeah, the nose is in place now.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.857
That's some progress.

33:05.192 --> 33:09.738
Let's take a break now.
My back is killing me. I...

33:09.821 --> 33:11.656
I slept so badly last night.

33:12.365 --> 33:15.535
It's impossible, you know.
There is no feeling in my work.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.287
I find your work to be very emotional.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.415
Well, if that's the case,
it's in spite of me.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.376
Ladies and gents.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.170
Hello.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.716
Bring a tray to the gentleman.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.228
- Mr. Alberto.
- Ah, hello. Thank you.

33:41.311 --> 33:42.646
<i>Bon appÃ©tit.</i>

33:44.189 --> 33:45.482
You want something, Jim?

33:45.565 --> 33:47.234
Uh, yeah,
I'll take a Coca-Cola, please.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.401
Yes, sir.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.279
A coke. Come on, hurry.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.914
- There you go.
- Thank you.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.084
I think it's going very well today.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.627
Mm. Maybe.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.839
Tomorrow will be better.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.051
Tomorrow we can really start.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.978
- When are you leaving?
- End of the week.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.648
Oh. Oh.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.567
Mm.

34:32.027 --> 34:34.239
I thought you were going to change
your reservation.

34:35.072 --> 34:35.907
I did.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.034
Mm. Mm.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.789
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.403
- Okay, let's go.
- All right.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.491
Thank you.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.201
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.244
Thank you.

35:22.912 --> 35:26.875
- No, no. Let's take a walk.
- All right.

35:26.958 --> 35:31.087
So, I'm confused.
You changed your reservation until...?

35:31.171 --> 35:33.882
- Yeah, the end of the week. Yeah.
- Oh, I see, I see.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.009
I... I, you know, I could change it again.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.596
I just... I would like to know, you know,
how many days do you need?

35:40.180 --> 35:41.640
Oh, I don't know.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.143
I think it would be great
to work for another week.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.104
- A week?
- A week, yes.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.564
I think a week would be good.

35:51.107 --> 35:51.941
Uh...

35:52.776 --> 35:57.656
No, no, no, a week is, is...
uh, that's fine. It's fine. I...

35:57.739 --> 35:59.783
I can just move my flight, um...

36:01.284 --> 36:02.952
Next Wednesday, would that...?

36:03.953 --> 36:07.040
Wednesday? Yes, Wednesday is good. Fine.

36:07.791 --> 36:11.127
- Let's say Wednesday.
- Okay. Good.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.256
- But then, you know...
- What?

36:15.340 --> 36:19.177
Well, there's no question of the portrait
ever being finished, so...

36:19.260 --> 36:21.721
No, no, no. Of course, of course.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.022
Have you ever wanted to be a tree?

36:33.858 --> 36:36.528
Um, no.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.164
Wait. Give me a minute.

36:50.166 --> 36:53.294
Isaku, how are you? Good to see you.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.922
No, no, no, no, don't get up.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.298
Where have you been?

36:57.382 --> 37:00.927
Uh, James and I have been walking.
I could do with a nap.

37:02.095 --> 37:05.014
But I must work, you know.
Good.

37:05.140 --> 37:08.727
<i>- Yeah. We were speaking a little bit.
- Good. Cheri.</i>

37:23.491 --> 37:24.325
Boo!

37:26.077 --> 37:27.454
Hello, Caroline.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.373
Hello, Jim.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.543
- Where is that old dog?
- He's, uh...

37:55.231 --> 37:58.902
No, no, Caroline, no.
Yes, yes, it's red. It is red.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.654
- It's a nice color, no?
- Yeah, but not on me.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.241
- Of course it is a good color.
- With white seats?

38:05.325 --> 38:07.452
- Oh.
- Oh.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.039
- It's very expensive.
- Good.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.125
- Very, very expensive.
- Very, very good.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.795
It's a car,
a car that she likes very much.

38:16.878 --> 38:19.839
Not that I like. That I love.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.633
The sailorman says
we can get it in a few days.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.011
<i>What do you mean, the "sailorman"?
No, no, no. The salesman.</i>

38:34.854 --> 38:37.607
But not now. In a few days, okay?

38:44.447 --> 38:48.868
Caroline, no, no. It's wrong.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.997
- You're going to drive me around?
- Absolutely.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.874
Oh, this makes me very nervous.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.675
- Come on!
- Okay, okay.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.386
- I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry.
- I'm posing now.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.396
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
I'll give you a ring later?

39:17.105 --> 39:19.274
- Thank you, James. Thank you.
- Mm.

39:24.612 --> 39:28.533
Stop moving. No, no. Okay. Okay.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.370
You have a mouth like a fish!

39:32.453 --> 39:36.791
You still have some red, there.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.316
- Your hair.
- What's with my hair?

40:01.399 --> 40:03.151
It's only that...

40:39.062 --> 40:41.397
- How is it going?
- How are you?

40:41.481 --> 40:43.691
I'm well. Is he here?

40:43.775 --> 40:47.946
- No, no, he's not here.
- We're supposed to have the...

40:49.197 --> 40:52.659
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- No. He disappeared.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.787
- Long ago or...?
- I don't know.

40:58.706 --> 41:02.251
- He'll come back some time.
- Eventually, I guess.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.725
I'm reading a new book.

41:17.976 --> 41:18.893
One of mine?

41:18.977 --> 41:21.396
God, no. No.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.192
What's it called?

41:26.275 --> 41:31.322
<i>It's called
The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.</i>

41:32.198 --> 41:33.908
Mm. What's it about?

41:34.993 --> 41:39.122
Uh... it's about a spy...

41:41.249 --> 41:42.875
who comes in...

41:45.503 --> 41:47.005
from the cold.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.718
<i>You could be a spy.</i>

41:52.844 --> 41:54.679
I am a spy.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.075
Hey, um, what...?

42:19.328 --> 42:20.496
What...?

42:22.290 --> 42:23.624
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

42:23.708 --> 42:27.712
- I have to junk all this stuff!
- What? No, no, no.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.673
- No, wait a minute. No.
- Yes.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.467
- No, no, no. Let's look at...
- No!

42:32.550 --> 42:36.387
- Diego, please.
- They're no good. They're not usable.

42:36.471 --> 42:37.972
The paper is too old.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.475
- Diego.
- Alberto.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.894
What?

42:47.440 --> 42:49.609
I go to the lithographer, all right?

42:49.692 --> 42:52.361
I want to talk to him
about transferring this stuff to stone.

42:52.445 --> 42:54.781
He says, "This paper is too old."

42:54.864 --> 42:56.657
They're perfectly valid as drawings.

42:56.741 --> 42:59.869
No! I did these as lithographs.
They were meant to be lithographs

42:59.952 --> 43:01.662
and this is what they now cannot be.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.087
He can go fuck himself.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.759
Oh, shit!

43:42.703 --> 43:45.081
You burned some drawings
that were on regular paper.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.669
- I did?
- Mm.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.922
- Did I?
- Mm.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.185
James?

44:19.907 --> 44:20.992
Sit down.

44:37.550 --> 44:38.593
Whew.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.430
<i>I was glad
when that day's session was over.</i>

44:43.139 --> 44:46.142
<i>Giacometti was miserable
and his mood was pervasive.</i>

44:46.934 --> 44:50.104
<i>I was to find out that evening
that Caroline had gone missing.</i>

44:59.822 --> 45:02.825
- But where'd she go?
- Who knows where she goes?

45:02.909 --> 45:06.787
- Wherever her pimp or pimps tell her to.
- Mm.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.497
Cheers.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.254
He's too attached to her.

45:16.756 --> 45:19.508
- Who, Alberto?
- Yeah. He goes crazy without her.

45:19.592 --> 45:23.179
- He makes himself go crazy.
- Yeah, why?

45:24.805 --> 45:30.311
My brother can only be happy
when he is desperate and uncomfortable

45:30.394 --> 45:33.439
in every part of his life.

45:36.359 --> 45:38.945
Well, he should be very happy, then.

45:43.074 --> 45:46.452
But it's like he's determined
to remain completely unsatisfied.

45:46.535 --> 45:50.748
No, not completely, just perfectly.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.251
Yeah.

45:58.047 --> 45:59.882
- She's beautiful.
- Who, Caroline?

45:59.966 --> 46:01.175
No, no, well, yes, but...

46:01.258 --> 46:05.471
- The bird you made me. Thank you.
- Oh. Yeah, you're welcome.

46:06.722 --> 46:09.225
She'll never fly, however.

46:39.588 --> 46:40.840
Oh, shit.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.585
Fucking hell!

49:21.083 --> 49:22.084
Alberto!

50:57.513 --> 50:59.056
<i>Have you ever killed anyone?</i>

51:01.058 --> 51:03.769
<i>- Excuse me?
- Have you ever killed anyone?</i>

51:04.186 --> 51:06.438
<i>No. Why do you ask?</i>

51:06.939 --> 51:09.942
<i>I think you're the sort of
person who's capable of doing anything,</i>

51:10.025 --> 51:11.610
<i>and I mean that as a compliment.</i>

51:12.278 --> 51:13.112
<i>Thank you.</i>

51:14.363 --> 51:16.115
<i>What about you?
Have you ever killed anyone?</i>

51:17.950 --> 51:20.953
<i>Mm.
In my mind, I've killed many people.</i>

51:22.621 --> 51:26.625
<i>- Anyone I know?
- No. No one I know, either.</i>

51:27.876 --> 51:30.713
<i>- Who are these poor souls?
- Just people.</i>

51:32.172 --> 51:33.382
<i>Women.</i>

51:33.465 --> 51:35.592
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

51:35.676 --> 51:38.762
<i>Before I could go to sleep,
when I was young,</i>

51:38.846 --> 51:42.057
<i>every night I'd fantasize
about killing two women.</i>

51:43.350 --> 51:44.685
<i>After I raped them.</i>

51:46.103 --> 51:46.937
Oh.

51:48.397 --> 51:51.525
And... and this helped you fall asleep?

51:51.942 --> 51:54.737
Yes. It comforted me.

52:03.996 --> 52:05.372
Fuck!

52:09.251 --> 52:11.045
Work on the background
or the body for a while.

52:11.128 --> 52:14.715
No! Everything has to happen
in its own time.

52:15.841 --> 52:18.761
If I paint the background or the body
just to be doing something,

52:18.844 --> 52:23.140
I'd just be filling in space.
It would be wrong.

52:23.223 --> 52:26.185
And then I'd have to abandon
the whole portrait completely.

52:26.268 --> 52:29.521
- Don't... don't do that. That's...
- That's what I should do.

52:29.605 --> 52:33.150
I should just abandon
the whole thing, the whole picture.

54:24.344 --> 54:28.307
<i>I know it's taking a long time.
Yes, I know that I said that I...</i>

54:29.475 --> 54:33.020
Listen, if you're just gonna berate me,
I'm gonna hang up.

54:33.103 --> 54:33.979
Well...

54:36.732 --> 54:38.400
The line dropped. Say that again.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.654
No, I have no control over it.

54:42.738 --> 54:46.366
Yes, thank you.
I know it's not brain surgery.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.535
And thank you for minimizing the process.

55:00.255 --> 55:01.507
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

55:01.590 --> 55:03.842
I'd like to change a reservation, please.

55:30.869 --> 55:32.996
- CÃ©zanne was right.
- About what?

55:33.080 --> 55:34.706
Squaring everything.

55:34.790 --> 55:38.502
Everything is a cone
or a cylinder or a sphere.

55:38.585 --> 55:41.338
- I guess you're right.
- You what?

55:41.421 --> 55:45.217
- I said I guess you're right.
- I know I'm right.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.345
CÃ©zanne was the last great painter.

55:48.428 --> 55:52.182
It was just too bad
the Cubists took him so literally.

55:52.266 --> 55:55.561
- The Cubists produced very pretty things.
- Oh, who needs pretty?

55:56.186 --> 55:58.730
Then they realized they'd reached
a dead end and gave up.

56:00.190 --> 56:03.443
Picasso and Braque
were the really guilty ones.

56:04.653 --> 56:05.821
<i>Right, but Picasso moved on.</i>

56:05.904 --> 56:09.241
Oh, yes, so that he could copy
every great artist that ever lived.

56:09.324 --> 56:10.951
- Well...
- It's true.

56:11.034 --> 56:14.955
- I know, but every artist copies.
- Yes, but you do it as an exercise.

56:15.038 --> 56:17.249
- It's just an exercise.
- Oh, Alberto.

56:17.332 --> 56:19.835
- What?
- I think you're being a bit harsh.

56:19.918 --> 56:22.296
No, it's true.
I'm telling you, I promise you.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.922
Picasso could be so pompous.

56:24.590 --> 56:27.175
"I was unable to reach
the top of the scale of values,

56:27.259 --> 56:30.762
so I smashed the scale."
Oh, that's bullshit.

56:31.179 --> 56:33.849
- He really said that?
- Of course he did. Who else would say it?

56:34.349 --> 56:36.852
Picasso's always making statements
like that, you know.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.104
At first they sound like
they're so full of wit,

56:39.187 --> 56:41.690
but they're full of shit.
They have absolutely no meaning.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.486
- Well, he's rather fond of you.
- No, he's not.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.698
- I thought you were friendly.
- We were for a while.

56:49.781 --> 56:52.618
But, you know, I let that go.

56:52.701 --> 56:54.953
Yeah, but didn't he ask for your opinion

56:55.037 --> 56:57.623
on a sculpture he was working on
and then changed it after...?

56:57.706 --> 56:59.833
- Who told you that?
- Dora Maar.

56:59.916 --> 57:01.126
What'd she say?

57:01.209 --> 57:02.878
She said he came to you,
asked your opinion and...

57:02.961 --> 57:03.962
Let me tell you what happened.

57:04.046 --> 57:06.089
He came to me.
He said, "I want your opinion."

57:06.173 --> 57:09.885
I said, "Okay, I think, you know,
you should make a change."

57:10.677 --> 57:14.348
And he made a change...
to the exact opposite of what I suggested.

57:14.431 --> 57:17.017
- Ah.
- Because he has no interest whatsoever

57:17.100 --> 57:21.313
in the ideas of collaboration
or artistic camaraderie, you know.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.523
He's too insecure.

57:23.607 --> 57:27.778
He just likes to steal other people's work
and pretend that they're his own ideas.

57:28.070 --> 57:28.904
Mm.

57:29.613 --> 57:32.282
The man's a thief.

57:35.661 --> 57:37.162
<i>I decided to take up swimming</i>

57:37.245 --> 57:39.915
<i>as a way to relieve
not only the physical strain of posing</i>

57:39.998 --> 57:43.210
<i>but what was slowly becoming
a psychological strain as well.</i>

58:03.355 --> 58:04.564
<i>One morning after my swim,</i>

58:04.648 --> 58:06.650
<i>I was invited to see
the ceiling of the opera house</i>

58:06.733 --> 58:09.111
<i>that Chagall had just painted.</i>

58:09.194 --> 58:13.615
<i>The magnificence of the work left me
feeling lighter than I'd felt in days.</i>

58:13.699 --> 58:16.618
<i>Then, I went to sit for Giacometti.</i>

58:16.702 --> 58:18.245
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

58:21.331 --> 58:23.542
Brute.

58:24.001 --> 58:26.545
Oh, fuck!
- Alberto.

58:26.628 --> 58:28.547
- What?
- Stop a bit.

58:28.630 --> 58:31.466
Yeah, why? Look at this. It's hopeless.

58:31.550 --> 58:33.802
The head is all lopsided. It's a mess!

58:41.476 --> 58:42.769
I saw the Chagall ceiling this morning.

58:43.770 --> 58:45.022
- At the opera?
- Mm.

58:45.105 --> 58:46.606
- You did?
- Mm-mm.

58:46.690 --> 58:50.068
I can't wait. Alberto is taking me
to the opening tomorrow night.

58:50.152 --> 58:52.863
I can't wait for you to see it.
You're going to love it.

58:52.946 --> 58:55.532
- Is it magnificent?
- Exquisite.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.159
- I'm sure.
- It's amazing.

58:57.242 --> 58:58.577
Apparently he did the whole thing
by painting...

58:58.660 --> 59:00.203
Stop moving around.

59:01.204 --> 59:02.039
Sorry.

59:03.915 --> 59:05.042
And don't scratch.

59:05.876 --> 59:08.128
- I had an itch.
- Well, don't itch.

59:09.629 --> 59:12.591
You know what?
I bought a new dress for it.

59:12.883 --> 59:14.760
- It's going to be quite a gala, I hear.
- Mm-mm.

59:14.843 --> 59:16.887
- Annette!
- Yes, darling?

59:16.970 --> 59:17.971
Ugh!

59:18.055 --> 59:19.139
Yes, of course.

59:24.978 --> 59:27.314
So where did you get the dress?

59:27.397 --> 59:29.191
In a very nice shop.

59:29.274 --> 59:33.361
It's a very nice dress.
It's yellow with a bit of pink.

59:33.445 --> 59:34.529
And I bought the shoes.

59:34.613 --> 59:35.906
They are so nice.

59:35.989 --> 59:37.741
Do they have a heel on them?

59:37.824 --> 59:40.118
Yes, it's yellow with pink flowers.

59:40.202 --> 59:43.246
They have high heels.
I think it's very ni...

59:48.001 --> 59:49.086
Beautiful.

59:50.629 --> 59:53.006
- Can I take that?
- If it is finished.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.424
Yes, it's finished.

59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.514
Chagall.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.142
Opera.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.270
Fucking house painting.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.691
You can't compare that
to what I'm trying to do here.

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:15.946
Oh, fuck!

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:21.660
Okay. Let's just stop there
before I destroy everything.

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.332
Would you excuse me a moment?
Ahem.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:51.231
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:55.819
- How much longer can it go on like this?
- It could go on forever.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.821
He says a portrait can never be finished.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:01.408
I can understand that.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.369
Of course not. I'm amazed
I've ever seen a portrait of his.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:06.788
I think I'm gonna die in there.
I can't keep going like this.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:08.540
I've gotta get back to New York.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:12.627
I've already pushed my trip so many times
and it's costing me a fortune.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:19.676
Well, maybe you could set a deadline.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:24.014
Alberto like to work up
against a deadline sometimes.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:25.473
Yeah.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.018
Maybe you could talk to him for me.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:30.896
No.

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:35.567
- Please?
- No. No. No.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:41.239
Well, at any rate,
I can't keep doing this.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.282
It seems like we pose...

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:45.035
for hours and hours and nothing happens.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.664
That's the reason
why I don't pose anymore.

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:53.168
Why? Thank you.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:56.755
Because your whole life
can be swallowed up.

01:01:57.505 --> 01:02:00.926
So, what do you think?

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.680
- It's lovely.
- Very pretty.

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:09.392
<i>Merci. You should see my bag.
It's beautiful. I show you.</i>

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:12.646
Alberto! Alberto!

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.522
- Bitch.
- Wake up!

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:17.234
Come and have a look!

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:20.320
- Oh, my God. My God.
- Wow.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.115
Wow.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.374
- No, no, no, no. You go ahead.
- But, Alberto...

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:35.043
- I don't want to.
- What's going on with him?

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:37.379
You said you wanted me
to drive you around.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.673
I'll drive you around. Get in the car.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.882
James, get in the car.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.467
Oh, no. I'm gonna take a picture
of the portrait.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.594
Fuck that portrait. Get in the car.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.805
- All right.
- Come on, James.

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:49.933
- I'll see you on the other side, eh?
- Come on.

01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:14.309
- Are you cold?
- No.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:18.521
I'm freezing.

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:22.484
- It's such a nice day out.
- Is it?

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:23.902
- Mm.
- Oh.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.076
I'm freezing. Maybe it was from being
in that stupid car.

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:39.042
- What are you doing?
- It's gonna get hot.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.419
You've got a heater on.
I'm gonna take my T-shirt off.

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:43.171
No, no, no. Keep it on. Sit down.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.758
- Get your coat on.
- All right.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.349
Sit down.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:56.851
Let's go.

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:17.539
It's gone too far.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.126
At the same time, not far enough.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.217
I'll never find a way out of this.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.555
Well, we could always just stop.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.349
No, we can't stop.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.065
I have to stop.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.111
Okay.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.163
Wow.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.457
It looks really good.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:45.293
What'd you do?

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.424
I have no idea.

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:54.969
I have to go and lie down.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.211
Diego told me he wasn't feeling well.

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:31.172
He's got a fever. It's 39.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.265
Mm.

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:47.355
Mm.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.418
It's going to be a madhouse anyway.

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.504
Yeah, you're right. It...

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:20.470
All right, well, feel better,
and, uh, I'll come check on you tomorrow.

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:26.310
Have a good night.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.037
Annette?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.247
- A cognac?
- Yes.

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.124
- A small cognac.
- Of course.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.792
- A small cognac.
- Thank you.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.131
It sounds like a great time.
It makes me nervous to think about it.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.925
James, I honestly thought
you'd love to come.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.803
Well, listen, I'm not saying I wouldn't,
I'm just saying that particular...

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.140
<i>- Bonjour, handsome.
- Hello, Caroline.</i>

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.893
- Did I frighten you?
- Well...

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:10.063
- Did you get excited?
- I did until I realized it was a woman.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.106
- May I introduce you to...
- I'll convert you, James.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.024
- I'll put up a fight.
- Good. I like fights.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.818
- Caroline!
- Yes, what?

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:17.487
- Are we going?
- I'm coming.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.238
Bye, James. Give Alberto a kiss from me.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:23.618
- You're not posing tonight?
- No, he's sick and, you know. Bye!

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.978
- Who is it?
- It's me.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.439
- Jim.
- Ah, hello, Jim.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.857
Someone's feeling better.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:58.319
- Oh, yes, thank you, very much better.
- Just a little bit of tenderness.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:09:59.779
- It was all he needed.
- Isn't it?

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:02.365
Yes, it's true.

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.827
Look at the tree.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.832
I've never seen it look this way before.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:15.378
- Yeah? You see them every day.
- I know, but it looks different.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:18.381
Everything looks different.
It's more beautiful.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.259
- And you.
- You're so sweet.

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:22.802
Okay, I've got to do the shopping.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:25.221
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:28.307
- Stay here with me, darling.
- Go on stop it, I need to go shopping.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.021
Thank you.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.441
Well?

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.277
Shall we get going?

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.952
James, wait, wait.

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:51.414
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.835
I wish that I could see things
the way you do.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.128
That's all I'm trying to do.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:10:59.797
I just want to show
how things appear to me.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.842
- But I'm unable to do that.
- No, that's not true.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:06.429
When I was young,
I thought I could do everything.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.931
When I grew up,
I realized I could do nothing.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:11.642
That's what kept me going.

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:16.522
- Four more sittings. How does that sound?
- Thank you.

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:17.899
No, no, I mean,

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:19.275
I... I don't know how to thank you.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.986
You don't have to do that.
We've worked on it together.

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:25.448
I don't know.
That's... I guess that's true.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:27.658
I certainly don't feel
how Madame CÃ©zanne did.

01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:28.826
What do you mean?

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.454
In the end she said
she just felt like an apple.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:38.461
I never thought she was very funny.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:44.300
I normally do the boat,
but it's a little bit of a longer journey.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.435
Oh, my God. What happened?

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.230
- Did they take anything?
- No, no.

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:00.441
- Well, shall we call the police?
- No, no, no.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.653
It wasn't thieves. They came for me.

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.323
It was Caroline's pimps.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.408
It's a warning.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.049
James, give me a hand with this thing.

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:37.562
- It will be the same price...
- No... in English, please.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:42.775
It's going to be the same price.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:43.860
Right.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:46.821
Whether you sleep with her
or she just sit in front of you.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.364
I see.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.492
- Same price for both.
- Mm.

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:53.286
You don't want to charge me more for one?

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.538
- What?
- What is he saying?

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.790
He is asking if we want
to charge more for one than the other.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.709
Which one would you charge me more for?

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.127
- For fucking her.
- Yeah, to fuck.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.213
- To fuck her.
- We could charge you more for both things.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.381
We can take more for both.

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:08.759
- Yeah, because it's cheap.
- Okay. Okay.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.513
- I don't mind.
- Okay.

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:15.099
Okay. So...

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:17.935
We can get a lot more in that case.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:22.106
- Another 10 per hour for each.
- Good.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.234
- Good.
- Yeah, good. Good.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.820
Plus another 20 an hour for her to pose.

01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:30.948
- What?
- What did he say?

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:33.159
- For her to pose for me.
- What did he say then?

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.037
- Twenty more for posing.
- Okay, yes. That's great.

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:39.123
- Yes, yes.
- No.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:41.500
- No, what?
- No, it's... I said no.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.835
It's very reasonable.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.463
I know, I know, but we said 10.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.590
- But why did you say that?
- Shut up. Shit.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.093
Ten. That's on top
of the other 10 for posing?

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.762
Yeah, and then we're good.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:55.681
- I'm happy to give you the 20.
- No, 10 is fine.

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:57.516
All right.

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.941
This pile is all retroactive.

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:06.525
What?

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.820
It's payment for the last
six months that I've spent with her.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:11.447
I don't speak English.
What does that mean?

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.116
It's payment for the last six months.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.787
And this pile is in advance
for the next six months.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:20.206
That's an advance
on the next six months.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.123
Ah.

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.501
- Cheers. Cheers!
- That's great.

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:34.470
- It was a pleasure.
- Pleasure shared.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:40.476
- There you go.
- Thanks.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:41.894
- Bye!
- Out of the way.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.944
It looks like you made them happy.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.029
Please.
I would have paid ten times that amount.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:52.989
What do you mean?

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.075
She's given me so much.

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:22.184
Oh, fuck!

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:39.952
- What are you doing?
- Negative work. I have to do this.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:45.708
Sometimes, you know, to do something,
you can only do it by undoing it.

01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:49.712
- Yes, but how many times?
- Mm?

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.631
- How many times?
- Good question.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:55.134
It's not always as easy as you think.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.094
What isn't?

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.183
The undoing of something.

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.061
I thought the portrait looked really good.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.023
- When?
- Earlier, when we started.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:14.236
It can be very tempting
to be satisfied with what's easy.

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:17.948
That happens a lot
when people tell you something's good.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.997
Tsk. There. That's good. Hm.

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:40.596
- Worse, isn't it?
- Well...

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:57.196
What's the matter?

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:03.202
Nothing. It's just sometimes it feels
like there's very little hope.

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:04.829
Hope?

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.665
Is that what you want? Hope?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.834
- Well, it'd be nice.
- Hm.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.919
We've been doing this for a while now.

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:14.922
Yes, but, you know, for me,

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:19.093
whenever I feel the most hopeful,
that's the time that I give up.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.346
It's like this man I knew

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:25.224
who fell when he was climbing
in the mountains in Stampa.

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:32.481
He was clinging on to this rock face
on a very steep cliff for ages,

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:35.442
right up until the point
that the rescue party came.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.654
About to reach out, grab his hand.

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.323
And he let go.

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:43.826
He fell.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.371
He died.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.794
- But you're in no danger of dying.
- No.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.881
But it feels like it sometimes.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.747
I'd like to change a reservation, please.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:05.652
I thought you said
you would make the deadline.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:08.530
- I did.
- You know what this means, a deadline?

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:12.743
Yes, I know what a deadline is.
But I tried. He's just... he's so...

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:14.620
I know. You're right.

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:16.246
Here's what I wanna do.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:20.125
You know when he uses
the big brush with the grey paint

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:23.128
and he undoes
everything he's already done?

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.213
Uh-huh.

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:27.424
It's normally after that that he grabs
a black brush with a fine tip

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:30.135
<i>and he starts to construct the head
all over again from nothing</i>

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.971
<i>- for the 100th time, right?
- Yeah. Basically, yes.</i>

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:34.598
Then he's onto the highlights
with the ochre

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:35.724
- and the grey and all.
- The grey. Yes.

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:38.185
And then he finishes
with the final touches of white.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.604
<i>- Uh-huh.
- Then he gets that big brush again...</i>

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:44.316
and obliterates
everything he's already done.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.651
Right.

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.862
- That's when I'm gonna stop him.
- What do you mean?

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.948
I mean I'm gonna try to stop him.

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:54.660
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.078
You're very brave.

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:36.660
I'm gonna take a minute.

01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:37.661
- Stretch my back out.
- What are you doing?

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.746
- Just... I'm just...
- What? Okay.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:42.458
Just stretch your back
and then we'll go straight back to work.

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:11.653
Hmm. It's coming along.

01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:16.158
It's just beginning
to have real possibilities, huh?

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.827
- You think?
- Yes.

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:23.707
Because the drawing is good
and the space around is more solid.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.292
- Very solid.
- Hm.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:31.548
This is the moment when we could really,
really start something.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.134
True, true.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.178
Well, I'm sorry I have to leave.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:38.597
Oh, no, no. You have to leave?

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.353
Yes, you remember, we talked.
I have to go back to New York.

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:47.356
Oh, well, that's too bad.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.775
Hm. It's too bad. We've gone far.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.818
We could have gone further,
but we've gone far.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:53.320
- Mm.
- That's something.

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:54.363
Yeah.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.740
Well, really,
I don't know how to thank you.

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:58.575
It's been an honor to pose for you.

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:03.705
Are you out of your mind?

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.417
I didn't say I wanted to do it again.

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:19.680
<i>The next day, Giacometti and I
went for a walk and said our goodbyes.</i>

01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:22.641
<i>He told me he would have liked
to accompany me to the airport,</i>

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:26.520
<i>but he was hesitant to ever get back
into a car any time soon.</i>

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.399
<i>The portrait was shipped
to an exhibition in the States</i>

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.901
<i>and I returned to New York
for an extended stay.</i>

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:36.613
<i>Giacometti and I wrote often
but never saw each other again,</i>

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.782
<i>as he was to die a short time later.</i>

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:43.912
<i>In his last letter, Giacometti told me
how much he enjoyed painting my portrait</i>

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.082
<i>and that he hoped
I would come back soon</i>

01:24:47.165 --> 01:24:51.044
<i>so that we could start all over... again.</i>
