[Tiger Claw growls]

00:17.484 --> 00:21.319
The Falchi twins,
punctual as ever.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.820
Tiger Claw.

00:22.822 --> 00:25.690
I believe that belongs to me.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.458
You ain't taking
the merchandise

00:27.460 --> 00:30.762
without forking over our loot.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.168
This had better
be worth the price.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.838
You don't want
to disappoint him.

00:40.840 --> 00:46.677
The infamous Slash,
not very stealthy for a ninja.

00:46.679 --> 00:52.150
What I lack in stealth,
I make up for in friends.

00:52.152 --> 00:55.119
Meet the Mighty Mutanimals.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.120
More freaks?

00:56.122 --> 00:57.655
Blast them!

[all grunting and groaning]

01:05.397 --> 01:07.498
Hold still,
you sneaky little--

01:07.500 --> 01:08.800
Ugh!

01:08.802 --> 01:10.268
Ah!

01:12.805 --> 01:15.239
Ah!

01:15.241 --> 01:18.209
Biff, get in the car!

01:18.211 --> 01:19.377
Get this thing moving.

01:30.590 --> 01:35.193
Feel the feathered wrath
of Pigeon Pete!

01:38.197 --> 01:40.865
I could use a snack.

01:44.903 --> 01:51.476
One more step and we find out
if all monkeys go to heaven.

01:55.714 --> 01:56.914
Ah!

01:58.450 --> 02:00.651
Secure the beast.

[growling]

03:32.678 --> 03:35.146
Your friends have no choice,
Crognard,

03:35.148 --> 03:38.849
since I, Melphador,
took control of their minds.

03:38.851 --> 03:43.020
They must obey me,
just as you will.

03:43.022 --> 03:45.623
[laughs maniacally]

03:45.625 --> 03:47.925
Your mind. Too small.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.161
Unable to take control.

Ah!

03:52.465 --> 03:54.498
Get him, Graah.

Spooch!

04:06.412 --> 04:07.578
Hey, guys,
ever notice how

04:07.580 --> 04:11.816
the cartoons we watch are kind
of just like our missions?

04:11.818 --> 04:12.617
Seriously?

04:12.619 --> 04:15.586
You're reading way too much
into a cartoon show, Mikey.

04:15.588 --> 04:20.791
Speaking of missions, I know
what our next one should be.

04:21.892 --> 04:24.695
Shredder.

04:24.697 --> 04:30.534
Why don't we take
him down once and for all?

04:30.536 --> 04:33.771
Because of that impulsive
overemotional state right there.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.441
Who are you calling impulsive
and overemotional?

04:37.443 --> 04:41.145
Honestly,
I'd go more with hotheaded.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.614
Ow! Ooh! Ah!

04:43.616 --> 04:46.517
Great, Raph's going off again.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.954
Maybe I'll just stay in the lab
for a while.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.788
Phew, there.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.924
I think the Shellraiser
is finally fixed.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.626
[bang]
Whoa!

04:55.628 --> 04:58.229
What was that?
Did Raph finally blow a gasket?

04:58.231 --> 05:00.665
'Cause I got spares.

05:04.636 --> 05:06.203
Turtles.

05:06.205 --> 05:07.605
Are you okay?

05:07.607 --> 05:09.106
Can't you see he's terrible?

05:09.108 --> 05:13.577
Look at his adorable
yet tortured gator face.

05:13.579 --> 05:14.545
Aww.

05:14.547 --> 05:16.580
Michelangelo is right.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.648
I bring dire news.

05:17.650 --> 05:24.021
Slash and Rockwell have been
captured by Tiger Claw.

05:24.023 --> 05:24.822
What? Why?

05:24.824 --> 05:30.695
He said they could be of use
to "him."

05:30.697 --> 05:33.831
I'll give you one guess
who "him" is.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.601
Yeah, that guy who does
the thing

05:37.603 --> 05:38.269
with the thing.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.505
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.873
Shredder.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.141
[laughing]

05:44.143 --> 05:46.944
(Mikey)
Oh, not Pigeon Pete.

05:46.946 --> 05:47.611
Wow.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.280
Now, this is a secret lair.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.849
(Mikey)
Anyone but Pigeon Pete.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.084
A tire swing!

05:53.086 --> 05:56.520
Is that a real Space Heroes
pinball machine?

05:56.522 --> 06:01.992
You ask me, the only thing
this place needs is some bread.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.762
We got better than bread.

06:04.764 --> 06:06.263
Pizza crusts, brah.

06:15.842 --> 06:19.944
Oh, where have you
been all my life?

06:19.946 --> 06:22.279
Why couldn't Tiger Claw
take him instead?

06:22.281 --> 06:23.981
Hey, I'm not crazy
about Slash,

06:23.983 --> 06:26.050
but the Mutanimals
are our friends,

06:26.052 --> 06:29.153
and we're gonna rescue them.

06:32.624 --> 06:34.725
[shrieks]

06:41.166 --> 06:42.666
You found the chemical?

06:42.668 --> 06:45.970
When have I failed you,
Shredder?

06:48.039 --> 06:51.642
All is ready, my master.

06:51.644 --> 06:55.746
This is the last ingredient
I needed to finish the formula

06:55.748 --> 07:02.119
that will give you
complete control over her.

07:02.121 --> 07:02.820
[shrieks]

07:02.822 --> 07:07.858
Before you give it to Karai,
test it on the teen mutants.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.226
Brilliant, sir,

07:09.228 --> 07:14.365
in case there are
unexpected side effects.

07:14.367 --> 07:19.603
Prepare yourselves,
my willing subjects.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.137
[groans]

07:20.139 --> 07:22.773
What are you gonna do to us?

07:23.341 --> 07:28.312
I'd just like to clarify that
we're not willing, not at all.

07:28.314 --> 07:32.016
The serum must be administered
directly to your brains,

07:32.018 --> 07:37.221
and I have just the creatures
to perform the task.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.322
(both)
Creatures?

07:38.324 --> 07:42.159
Observe my little worm

I mean it.

08:08.153 --> 08:09.687
What are you doing, Raph?

08:09.689 --> 08:10.988
Going in all blades
blazing,

08:10.990 --> 08:12.890
like we should have
done weeks ago.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.893
We don't even know exactly
where they are.

08:15.895 --> 08:16.861
We need a plan.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.762
(Pigeon Pete)
You need a recon fly-by?

08:18.764 --> 08:20.865
I'm the birdman for the job.

Pigeon Pete's a go!

[shouting]

08:29.041 --> 08:32.142
Rockwell, we've got to move.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.410

09:00.039 --> 09:02.072
Slash, are you okay?

[softly]
Raphael.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.277
What did Shredder do to you?

09:06.279 --> 09:07.411
They don't look so good.

09:07.413 --> 09:11.348
We've got to get them back
to the lair, guys.

09:12.851 --> 09:16.320
Your escape
was very fortuitous.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.889
Shredder is not one
easily eluded.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.726
Ah, we're just glad
you two are okay.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.427
Are you sure?

09:23.429 --> 09:26.297
'Cause something seems
off about you two.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.499
They did do something to us.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.301
Yes, it's all coming back now.

09:30.303 --> 09:34.171
We were being experimented
upon by Shredder.

09:34.173 --> 09:35.406
Experimented on?

09:35.408 --> 09:40.110
He had these strange
little worm creatures,

09:40.112 --> 09:42.947
and then--and then...

09:42.949 --> 09:45.249
Dude, don't leave us hanging.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.817
[grunts]

09:46.819 --> 09:49.353
Let me get you some water.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.236
This can't be happening.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.638
How could you, Slash?

10:07.640 --> 10:10.975
Splinter must be...

10:10.977 --> 10:12.276
destroyed!

10:12.278 --> 10:16.113
You'll never hurt Sensei
again.

Rockwell's gone crazy too.

10:34.132 --> 10:37.267
Ah!
A little help, Raph.

10:39.704 --> 10:42.306
Don't make me hurt you, Slash.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.676
Don't make me laugh, monster.

I don't know
what's come over you, Doc,

but snap out of it!

machine beeps]

10:59.191 --> 11:02.259
Rockwell,
why are you doing this?

11:02.261 --> 11:06.430
It is the will of the master.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.699
(Don)
He's mind-controlled.

11:11.069 --> 11:13.303
Shredder desires one
of the turtles.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.205
(Raph)
I volunteer to go
kick his butt

11:15.207 --> 11:18.042
right after I kick yours.

We need this door open now!

fully operational.

Donnie, slow 'em down.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.329

Taking out the trash.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.036
Deploying battering ram.

12:21.773 --> 12:24.441
That's close enough, turtles.

Oil slick!
Oil slick!

12:32.250 --> 12:34.585

They got away with Raph.

At least we know
where they're going.

Looks like we're gonna
do what Raph wanted after all,

Where am I?

Slash, Rockwell,
snap out of it!

12:54.607 --> 12:56.306
It's no use.

12:56.308 --> 13:00.511
With my mind control serum
coursing through their brains,

13:00.513 --> 13:03.647
resistance is futile.

at taking orders.

Ask Leo.

Um, shouldn't we make a plan?

13:39.518 --> 13:41.351
Forget the plan.

13:41.353 --> 13:44.488
Leatherhead, get ready
to make a door.

13:50.295 --> 13:51.662
[sighs]

13:54.833 --> 13:56.900
Where am I?

14:03.775 --> 14:06.643
Your new home, mutant.

14:06.645 --> 14:07.411
Shredder.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.280
Finally, I've been
waiting for this.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.849
Stop.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.151
[groaning]

14:16.487 --> 14:20.157
Now bow to me.

14:27.765 --> 14:30.834
Attack me!

14:30.836 --> 14:33.737
Harder.
Without mercy.

14:54.826 --> 14:57.828
[distant grunting]

15:02.700 --> 15:03.901
Enough.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.970
[groaning]

15:06.972 --> 15:09.439
[roars]

15:09.441 --> 15:10.707
(Pigeon Pete)
Whoa!

15:10.709 --> 15:11.842
[shrieks]

15:11.844 --> 15:12.809
It's Raph!

15:12.811 --> 15:16.580
(Leo)
Raph, do it.
End this.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.215
What is he waiting for?

15:18.217 --> 15:19.316
[laughing maniacally]

15:19.318 --> 15:23.320
Raphael is mine now
to control...

15:23.322 --> 15:23.987
[doors slam]

15:23.989 --> 15:27.658
(Shredder)
As are your other
mutant friends.

15:29.928 --> 15:33.697
No escape for you, reptiles.

15:40.271 --> 15:40.938
Raph?

15:40.940 --> 15:46.877
(Shredder)
Now, let us welcome
you properly.

15:50.014 --> 15:53.383
[laughing maniacally]

15:53.385 --> 15:54.484
[shouts]

15:54.486 --> 15:56.720
Raph, snap out of it, man!

15:56.722 --> 15:59.056
Shredder's the enemy.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.925
<i>You</i> are the enemy.

16:01.927 --> 16:06.396
Let us see
what my new servants can do.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.833
[dramatic music]

16:09.835 --> 16:15.038
You take Slash;
I'll take fly boy.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.841
Ah!

16:17.843 --> 16:19.977
I am your friend, Slash.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.845
Not anymore!

16:23.614 --> 16:25.482
Get off of me, bug boy.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.452
You look delicious.

16:36.961 --> 16:39.896
Hey, watch the mandibles,
you jerk.

16:39.898 --> 16:43.033
Your pathetic ninjutsu
is no match

16:43.035 --> 16:45.836
for the power of my mind.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.442
Oh! Ha!
Oh!

16:52.444 --> 16:54.111
Oh! Oh!

16:54.113 --> 16:55.579
[yells]

16:57.715 --> 17:00.617
Ah!
[grunts]

17:02.553 --> 17:06.390
Whoa!
No fair with the ice guns!

17:10.928 --> 17:13.497
Raph, you've got
to break Shredder's control.

17:13.499 --> 17:17.134
This isn't you.
Where's that crazy temper?

17:17.136 --> 17:18.101
Don't be a fool.

17:18.103 --> 17:23.040
There's nothing
you can say, Leonardo.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.474
Break free, you jerk!

17:33.418 --> 17:35.786
[laughs maniacally]

17:35.788 --> 17:37.154
Ah!

17:50.802 --> 17:51.701
I think I get it.

17:51.703 --> 17:56.873
You can't feel emotion because
you're Shredder's puppet.

17:56.875 --> 17:57.741
As a matter of fact,

17:57.743 --> 18:01.611
I'll bet you like doing
whatever Shredder tells you.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.480
[grunts]

18:04.715 --> 18:06.750
You probably love it.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.085
Ah!

18:11.823 --> 18:15.459
[groaning]

18:18.029 --> 18:20.897
Raph?

18:20.899 --> 18:22.999
How's it going, brother?

18:23.001 --> 18:25.869
Stockman, what is going on?

18:25.871 --> 18:28.238
I don't know, sir.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.940
Leo, you're a genius.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.708
Ow, ow, ow.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.211
Something you're obviously not,
Rockwell.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.579
Ow! Ow!

18:35.581 --> 18:37.080
So you can make
me slap myself.

18:37.082 --> 18:37.747
Ow!

18:37.749 --> 18:39.116
If you had a brain
to go with your powers,

18:39.118 --> 18:42.719
you might actually--ow--be
smarter than a gibbering baboon!

18:42.721 --> 18:43.787
- Ow!
- What?

18:43.789 --> 18:44.688
How dare you?

18:44.690 --> 18:47.924
A reptilian-brained
evolutionary throwback--

18:47.926 --> 18:49.893
[gagging]

18:52.897 --> 18:54.164
[shrieks]

18:54.166 --> 18:56.099
Sorry about the insults, Doc.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.034
No, they were necessary,

18:58.036 --> 19:00.804
although complete fabrications.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.038
Agree to disagree.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.941
Now blast that worm
out of Slash!

19:04.943 --> 19:07.677
[grunting]

19:15.720 --> 19:19.556
It is time
I end this experiment.

19:28.799 --> 19:31.301
Hi-yi-yi!

19:31.303 --> 19:35.005
Turtles, Mutanimals, get him!

19:45.750 --> 19:47.551
[grunting]

20:09.006 --> 20:10.607
[both grunt]

20:12.777 --> 20:14.578
[roars]

20:23.955 --> 20:25.722
[laughs]

20:33.698 --> 20:35.799
Another time.

20:43.007 --> 20:44.941
[grunts]

20:53.150 --> 20:55.385
[shouts]

20:56.921 --> 21:01.858
I'm sorry, master Splinter.

21:01.860 --> 21:05.028
When I attacked, I could see
everything that was happening,

21:05.030 --> 21:08.965
but I couldn't control
my actions.

21:08.967 --> 21:13.169
Please, forgive me.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.839
There is nothing
to forgive, my friend.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.807
This was Shredder's doing.

21:17.809 --> 21:20.143
Your mind was not your own.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.845
Those worms
must have programmed

21:21.847 --> 21:23.913
you two
like sleeper agents.

21:23.915 --> 21:25.148
Indeed, it was dreadful.

21:25.150 --> 21:28.084
My thanks to all of you
for saving us.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.720
All I know is
that those worms were nasty,

21:30.722 --> 21:33.023
and it's awesome
to have you guys back.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.760
Thanks, little brother,
but we owe it all to Leo.

21:36.762 --> 21:37.927
Well, what would
we do without you?

21:37.929 --> 21:41.264
Every team needs
an impulsive, loudmouthed,

21:41.266 --> 21:43.400
super-violent hothead, right?

21:43.402 --> 21:44.968
[groaning]

21:46.404 --> 21:49.839
[groaning]

21:49.841 --> 21:51.207
You're the best, bro.

21:51.209 --> 21:53.410
Okay, all right.
All right.
