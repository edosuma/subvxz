AMANDA: Yeah, I'm okay.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.871
ST AHMA: Datak is very angry with you.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.661
May I ask you why?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.163
Why what?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.836
Why did you refuse my husband?

29:19.007 --> 29:21.669
-For you.
-For me?

29:21.844 --> 29:24.381
I know that it hurts you
when he sleeps with other women,

29:24.555 --> 29:25.840
and I can't do anything about that,

29:26.014 --> 29:29.256
but I can make sure that
I'm not part of that problem.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.845
(LAUGHS)

29:34.356 --> 29:36.722
You are very sweet.

29:39.361 --> 29:40.692
And very stupid.

29:43.407 --> 29:48.527
Saying no to Datak
has made him angry and suspicious,

29:48.871 --> 29:54.707
and for a Castithan man, wearing
a cuckold's horns is a great shaming.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.583
I know that you're in a bad marriage.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.129
-It isn't bad at all.
-No, don't lie.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.540
I've been there too.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.213
I love my husband.

30:05.387 --> 30:09.380
I hate that he orders you around.
I hate that you're not free.

30:13.020 --> 30:18.060
I am enjoying our visits together very much.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.523
Me too.

30:30.329 --> 30:34.823
If they are to continue,
you must learn to control your hatred.

30:36.210 --> 30:38.201
You need to play the game better,

30:40.464 --> 30:41.920
smarter.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.097
Theres- a breach on
the norm edge of Lake Nothing.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.887
That is odd.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.094
Here's what I want you to do.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.932
Seal off that level, and don't talk to anybody.

-Yes, sir.

Hello, Commander.

Lawkeepet's been turning
the town upside down looking for you.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.307
Want some company?

31:45.946 --> 31:46.981
Stay back.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.990
Are you gonna shoot me or not?

31:57.040 --> 31:58.905
I haven't decided yet.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.329
Well, can I sit while you do?

32:02.754 --> 32:04.665
I'm not getting any younger here.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.251

(SIGHING)

32:25.360 --> 32:28.227
So, how do you like the view?

32:29.364 --> 32:32.401
Well, when you showed it to me,
it seemed worth seeing.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.783
Yeah. I come here all the time.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.872
-(WATER SPLASHING)
-(CHUCKLES)

32:41.043 --> 32:44.456
Now that you've seen it, what next?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.749
Maybe I'll just sit here for a bit,

32:49.926 --> 32:53.714
see if I've got enough courage
to throw myself over the edge.

32:55.349 --> 32:57.135
It's good to test your limits.

32:58.352 --> 33:00.092
Helps a man make wiser choices

33:00.270 --> 33:03.512
when he understands
what he is and isn't capable of.

33:03.732 --> 33:06.189
Helps you grow. Helps you change.

33:07.486 --> 33:11.695
I'm a weapon. That's never gonna change.
It's what I am.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.902
You know what I don't like about lndogenes?

33:18.080 --> 33:21.413
No feelings. Everything's mechanical.
They never change.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.870
Humans change all the time.

33:26.088 --> 33:29.797
You raged like Jonah against
the fate that's handed to you.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.173
It's the nature of what's inside you.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.091
You're human.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.596
(VOICE BREAKING)
Nothing makes sense any more.

33:39.393 --> 33:40.724
It's too hard.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.895
And I lost a son.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.904
You're wearing his clothes.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.615
I'm sorry.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.739
Yeah.

34:02.416 --> 34:06.329
(SIGHS) Life's handed me reason enough
to throw myself off this cliff.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.036
Why not?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.998
Because I'm not a coward.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.167
Because I love life enough

34:15.345 --> 34:18.803
that I'm gonna hold on
to every moment, good or bad,

34:18.974 --> 34:22.182
until my higher power sees ﬁt
to take it all away from me.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.144
But then again,

34:27.023 --> 34:29.560
if somebody were to offer me
a second chance,

34:30.777 --> 34:32.563
I'd take it in a shot,

34:34.948 --> 34:38.236
and I don't care what kind of
vessel they put me in.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.192
As long as I had my life,

34:41.329 --> 34:42.785
my memories,

34:44.166 --> 34:45.576
I'd still be me.

34:56.720 --> 35:00.383
You think she'd still want me, like this,

35:01.308 --> 35:02.764
after 30 years?

35:03.643 --> 35:07.261
If she loved you,
she'd take you any way she could.

35:08.190 --> 35:10.146
What if I'm not as strong as you?

35:12.277 --> 35:13.778
Then jump.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.952
Thank you for trying.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.000
Give that back to Nolan for me.

35:37.677 --> 35:38.883
Yeah.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.863
You heard about Gordon, I take it?

36:03.703 --> 36:06.365
The guy survived a space
disaster over 30 years ago,

36:06.540 --> 36:08.371
only to jump off a terraformed cliff.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.078
Go ﬁgure.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.871
The Votan part of him was dead.
The human part was a lie.

36:16.758 --> 36:20.751
He didn't ﬁt in anywhere.
He was a loaded weapon waiting to go off.

36:23.098 --> 36:29.059
I can't help fantasize that Gordon McClintock
is knocking on some door somewhere,

36:29.271 --> 36:31.182
about to sweep a little old lady off her feet.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.097
You're insanely romantic.

36:34.442 --> 36:35.568
Hmm.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.859
Not so romantic.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.230
I'm turning down your offer.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.441
My place is here.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.283
Okay.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.124
Let's talk straight.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.372

Earth Republic wants into Deﬁance.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.458
(SCOFFS) No kidding.
They want to get their hands on our gulanite.

37:01.636 --> 37:05.299
Well, it powers almost everything these days,
and this town is on a mother lode.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.180
It's recently become a top priority
for the organisation.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.808

You know her?

37:16.651 --> 37:19.609
She tried to rob the town and blackmail me.

37:20.030 --> 37:23.238
CONNOR: She's convinced her boss
that you are the problem,

37:23.533 --> 37:25.865
and that under a more pliable leader,

37:26.036 --> 37:29.654
Deﬁance would welcome the Earth Republic
with open arms.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.371
Well, that's not true.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.457
Well, there's no way they can know that
unless they've removed you.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.164
By 'removed,' you mean...

37:37.797 --> 37:39.503
Whatever it takes.

37:42.802 --> 37:46.010
If you leave Deﬁance,
you're no longer a threat.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.843

In New York, I could protect you.

Can you not...
Can you not recognise

37:59.611 --> 38:02.444
that it wasn't easy for me to come here
after everything that happened?

38:02.906 --> 38:07.696
I didn't ask you to come here.
I didn't ask you to insert yourself into my life.

38:08.411 --> 38:12.950
Right, because you don't need anybody.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.739
Those human connections,
they just slow you down.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.033
They make you weak.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.576
Come on. Don't say that.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.164
If you had only trusted me...

38:19.339 --> 38:21.625
If you had only talked to me ﬁrst,
we'd still be together.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.842
If you'd had a little faith, we'd be a family.

it wants and it doesn't care who it hurts.

That was decent of him.

Yeah, well, he was a decent kid.

I was thinking we might
send somebody down the mines,

give him a decent burial.
