01:12.239 --> 01:13.948
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

01:21.415 --> 01:22.790
TECHNICIAN:
This is Operations.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.334
General O'Neill is inbound,
20 minutes out.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.504
Dr. Weir.
Peter.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.260
You see? Nothing.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.428
Carson, get back here.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.764
I can sit in that chair all
bloody day long, and
nothing will happen.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.682
It's a waste of time.
Excuse me, Dr. Weir.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.434
He's not even trying.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.353
He's the one who discovered
the gene this technology
responds to.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.773
Yeah, well, he said
he wished he never
had it.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.941
Really?
I know. Can you believe that?

01:49.026 --> 01:51.277
We could always test
you a third time, Rodney.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.612
That's very funny.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.655
We have only found
a handful of people

01:54.740 --> 01:57.033
who are genetically compatible
with the ancient technology,

01:57.117 --> 02:00.787
and despite your heroic
efforts to interface
ours with theirs,

02:00.871 --> 02:03.164
we need every one of them
to sit in this chair,

02:03.248 --> 02:04.290
including Dr. Beckett.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.459
What am I
supposed to do?
He's afraid of the thing.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.920
This chair controls
the most powerful weapons
known to humankind.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.964
I'm afraid of the thing.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.925
WEIR: But every time
someone sits in it,

02:14.009 --> 02:16.969
we learn something new about
the Ancients who built this
outpost.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.514
Dr. Beckett should be proud
he's genetically advanced.

02:19.598 --> 02:23.059
It's not more advanced.
It is a random characteristic.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.980
This really bothers you,
this whole gene thing, huh?

02:28.065 --> 02:30.566
Clearly,
I am overcome with envy.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.319
Just the people I need to see.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.741
Come with me.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.163
We've gotten
closer and closer to finding
the location of the lost city,

02:44.248 --> 02:47.375
but it turns out
we've been looking in
the wrong place all along.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.921
Now, we thought we
had a stargate address.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.840
Six symbols representing
coordinates in space

02:53.924 --> 02:55.842
that determined the location
of the planet the Ancients
went to

02:55.926 --> 02:57.009
after they left Antarctica.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.095
Now, recently,
we determined
a seventh symbol.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.766
The point of origin, Earth.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.268
That's not it.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.727
Then your address
must be incorrect.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.771
Not incorrect. Incomplete.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.360
What are you saying,
Dr. Jackson?

03:15.445 --> 03:16.946
It's an eight-symbol address.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.074
What we're looking for may be
further away than we ever
imagined,

03:20.158 --> 03:21.576
but it's not
out of reach.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.786
Atlantis.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.123
Atlantis.
I think we can go there.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.052
Apache,
Black Hawk,
Cobra, Osprey...

04:21.762 --> 04:23.930
It's a lot of training
for the Antarctic.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.183
It was the one continent
I'd never set foot on.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.769
It's one of my least
favorite continents.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.563
I kind of like it here.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.691
You like it here?

04:35.776 --> 04:36.901
Yes, sir.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.321
We'll be there in
about 10 minutes, sir.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.368
Look, we've been
through this.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.494
I'm not your man.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.578
Keep moving.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.080
I'm a doctor.
A medical doctor.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.373
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.458
You don't understand.
I break things like that.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.920
This device has survived for
millions of years intact.
It will survive you.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.255
Now, sit down,
close your eyes
and concentrate.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.548
(SIGHS)

05:04.221 --> 05:05.304
Again, nothing.

05:05.389 --> 05:10.309
This time just try to imagine
an image of where we are
in the solar system.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.609
I think I feel something.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.113
It could be lunch-related.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.906
Shut up and concentrate.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.505
WOMAN: Watch out!

05:42.259 --> 05:43.509
What did I do?

05:43.635 --> 05:45.052
(DRONE WHOOSHING)

05:46.221 --> 05:47.638
Get us back down there.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.561
TECHNICIAN:
All inbound craft,
we have a rogue drone

05:53.645 --> 05:55.229
that could seek
a target on its own.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.314
Land immediately and
shut down your engines.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.691
This is not a drill.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.192
It's too late. Hang on.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.787
Break right.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.957
I said "right"!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.250
I'm getting to that, sir.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.131
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

06:24.968 --> 06:26.719
I told you I was
the wrong person.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.554
It doesn't matter now.
Just do something.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.556
Like what?
Okay, Carson,

06:30.640 --> 06:34.643
concentrate on shutting that
weapon down before it hurts
someone.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.404
I can't see it.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.822
Pull up. Pull up!

06:57.334 --> 06:58.334
What about now?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.418
Now's good.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.638
Shut it down.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.558
Sir, what the hell was that?

07:14.643 --> 07:16.310
Wait for it.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.651
Get out!

07:41.920 --> 07:43.087
I think I did it.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.307
That was different.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.978
For me, not so much.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.483
Major Sheppard is reporting
the drone appears to have
been incapacitated.

08:04.568 --> 08:05.693
(SIGHING)

08:05.777 --> 08:09.238
FORD: General O'Neill's
helicopter is unharmed and
on its way again.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.323
Seven minutes out.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.908
Thank God.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.743
Holy crap.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.167
Jack.
Daniel.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.252
Warm welcome.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.587
It wasn't me.
How did you manage to...

08:24.671 --> 08:27.006
Keep my ass from getting
blown out of the sky?

08:27.090 --> 08:30.009
The exceptional flying
of Major John Sheppard.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.093
He likes it here.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.678
Exceptional.
You like it here?

08:32.761 --> 08:35.681
What say we cut to the part
where you start talking
real fast?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.224
Weir's in here.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.102
Hey, don't touch anything.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.770
Yes, sir.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.988
I figure
the Ancients packed up
their entire city and left

08:51.072 --> 08:53.782
somewhere between
5 and 10 million years ago.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.369
In their flying city?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.163
Yes.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.374
What?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.753
Flying city?

09:06.129 --> 09:09.840
Well, keeping in mind
this is the race
that built the stargates.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.384
They did
everything big.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.719
So why did they leave?

09:13.803 --> 09:15.930
Why did they leave?
Who knows?

09:16.014 --> 09:18.057
We know the Ancients on Earth
were suffering from a plague.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.435
Maybe some of them
were trying to start over
seeding life in a new galaxy.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.811
Maybe that's
what Ancients do.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.980
The point is,
we know where they went.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.523
Pegasus.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.610
Yes, it's the name of
a dwarf galaxy in the
local group.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.571
After all that time,
is there any hope of
actually meeting them?

09:32.656 --> 09:36.158
Well, who knows, but isn't
that reason enough to go?

09:37.118 --> 09:40.663
I've been choosing members
for this expedition for
months, Doctor.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.623
I'm not the one
who needs convincing.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.959
Well, I'm convinced.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.211
Have fun.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.755
It's a little more
complicated than that.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.715
We need the ZPM
to power the gate.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.093
What?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.720
ZPM. He's Canadian.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.556
I'm sorry.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.100
Zero-Point Module, General.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.270
The ancient power source
that you recovered
from Praclarush Taonas

10:04.354 --> 10:06.730
and that's now powering
the outpost's defenses.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.358
I've since determined that it
generates its enormous power

10:09.442 --> 10:10.776
from vacuum energy

10:10.860 --> 10:14.071
derived from a self-contained
region of subspace time.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.491
That was a waste of
a perfectly good explanation.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.369
The answer is no.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.666
BECKETT: The second I shut
my eyes, I could see.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.710
I just felt this power
that I've never had before.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.045
I had it dancing
all across the sky.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.089
It was magical,
it really was. I mean...

10:32.173 --> 10:34.258
Well, they are lucky.
I don't know where
it came from.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.553
I just tried to concentrate,
and the drone shut itself
down.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.306
So you were the one.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.890
Me?

10:43.226 --> 10:46.228
You're the one who
fired that thing at me.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.315
Look, we're doing research,

10:49.816 --> 10:52.776
working with technology
that's light-years beyond us,

10:52.861 --> 10:54.653
and we make mistakes.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.781
I'm incredibly,
incredibly sorry.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.825
Well, next time,
just be a little
more careful, okay?

10:59.909 --> 11:00.909
That's what I said.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.369
What the hell was
that thing, anyway?

11:02.454 --> 11:03.871
You mean the drone?

11:03.955 --> 11:06.332
The weapon
the Ancients built
to defend this outpost.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.583
The who?

11:07.959 --> 11:10.836
You do have security
clearance to be here?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.422
Yeah, General O'Neill
just gave it to me.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.967
Then you don't even know
about the stargate.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.218
The what?

11:18.303 --> 11:21.430
Jack, you know the gate
to another galaxy requires
an enormous amount of power.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.223
Yes, I do.
Find another way.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.767
There's no other way.

11:26.603 --> 11:30.981
Do you think there are more
of these "Z" things in
Atlantis?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.900
Yes, and who knows
what else we could find.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.902
This isn't just
some other civilization
we're talking about.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.987
These are the gate builders.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.948
WEIR: The potential wealth of
knowledge and technology...

11:40.033 --> 11:44.036
It outweighs anything
we've come across since we
stepped through the stargate.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.831
Well, with the amount
of power you'll need
to make this trek,

11:47.916 --> 11:49.583
odds are it'll be one-way.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.834
Yes, we know.

11:50.919 --> 11:54.713
But the benefit to humanity
is far greater than the
risk, General.

11:54.798 --> 11:58.550
And it is a risk that every
one of my expedition members
is willing to take.

12:03.973 --> 12:08.227
We think the gene was used
as a sort of genetic key,
if you will.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.062
So that only their
kind could operate

12:10.146 --> 12:12.898
certain dangerous or
powerful technologies.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.860
So some people have
the same genes as these
Ancients?

12:16.945 --> 12:18.946
The specific
gene is very rare,

12:19.030 --> 12:21.490
but on the whole, they look
very much like we do.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.242
In fact, they were first.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.661
We're the second
evolution of this form.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.788
The Ancients having
explored this galaxy

12:27.872 --> 12:29.081
for millions of
years before...

12:29.165 --> 12:30.416
Major, please don't.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.252
Come on, what are the odds
of me having the same
genes as these guys?

12:37.298 --> 12:38.799
Quite slim, actually.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.301
Dr. Weir! Don't move.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.855
Who is this?

12:55.358 --> 12:56.900
I said
"Don't touch anything."

12:56.985 --> 12:58.444
I just sat down.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.864
Major, think
about where we are
in the solar system.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.543
Did I do that?

13:16.880 --> 13:20.841
We could be on our way
to discovering an entirely
new ancient civilization.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.970
At the best-case scenario,
we meet actual Ancients
who are willing to help us.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.430
But if we don't...

13:27.724 --> 13:29.558
General, we need him.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.478
Sorry, Doc,
I need Daniel here.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.605
I'm talking
about Major Sheppard.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.274
Oh!

13:37.609 --> 13:39.818
Don't you have a dozen
or so people already

13:39.903 --> 13:41.445
who can use
the ancient technology?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.573
Yes, with concentration
and training, they can
make it work.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.409
But John Sheppard,
he does it naturally.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.661
You know, I've checked
into his record.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.247
I know
about the whole supposed
black mark in Afghanistan.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.500
He was trying
to save the lives
of three servicemen.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.377
Disobeying a direct
order in the process.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.589
I have read
your own file,
General. Please.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.008
Right.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.513
Okay, it's your expedition.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.348
You want him, you ask him.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.099
That's the thing. I have.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.603
Really?

14:21.361 --> 14:25.113
This isn't a long trip,
so I'll be as succinct
as possible.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.370
Well, that's pretty succinct.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.080
Thank you.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.794
I told Dr. Weir
that I'd think about it.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.797
And?

14:43.007 --> 14:45.717
So? Well? What?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.765
With all due respect, sir,
we were just attacked
by an alien missile,

14:51.849 --> 14:54.059
and then I found out
I have some mutant gene.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.436
Then there's
this stargate thing.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.772
And these expeditions
to other galaxies.

14:58.856 --> 15:02.401
You know, this
isn't about you, Sheppard.
It's a lot bigger than that.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.278
Right now,
at this very second,

15:04.362 --> 15:07.906
whether I decide to go
on this mission or not,
seems to be about me.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.783
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

15:10.827 --> 15:12.286
Let me ask you something.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.335
Why did you
become a pilot?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.462
I think people who
don't want to fly
are crazy.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.048
And I think
people who don't want
to go through the stargate

15:25.133 --> 15:26.800
are equally as whacked.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.096
Now, if you can't
give me a "yes" by the time
we reach McMurdo,

15:31.180 --> 15:33.056
I don't even want you.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.319
(SIGHS)

15:46.029 --> 15:47.237
Simon,

15:48.281 --> 15:50.324
if you're watching this,

15:50.408 --> 15:54.786
it means the President has
been kind enough to grant
you security clearance.

15:54.871 --> 15:58.332
I'm not going on a diplomatic
mission to another country.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.042
I'm going to another planet

16:00.126 --> 16:04.046
in another galaxy by means
of a device called a stargate.

16:04.672 --> 16:09.092
Millions of years ago, there
was a race of beings we call
the Ancients.

16:09.177 --> 16:12.137
They created a network
of these stargates
throughout our galaxy

16:12.221 --> 16:15.098
in order to travel
freely among their worlds.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.976
We don't know why, but
they left for another galaxy

16:18.061 --> 16:20.729
somewhere between
5 and 10 million years ago,

16:20.813 --> 16:23.315
taking their entire city
along with them.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.609
That city was called Atlantis.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.278
I have been assembling
an expedition team

16:28.363 --> 16:29.905
in order to try
to find Atlantis

16:29.989 --> 16:33.909
and, hopefully, the Ancients,
who left Earth all those
years ago.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.580
I want to do this, Simon,
with all my heart.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.248
You know me
well enough to know

16:40.333 --> 16:42.668
I could never turn down
an opportunity like this,

16:42.752 --> 16:44.878
but I wanted
the chance to tell you.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.387
FEMALE OPERATOR:
The cellular customer
you are trying to reach

16:53.471 --> 16:55.514
is currently outside
the coverage area.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.850
No kidding.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.609
I narrowed it down to about
three things, but after
a week,

17:08.694 --> 17:10.237
it just kind of
fell into place.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.321
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

17:18.121 --> 17:19.329

whatever language these
guys are speaking?

17:28.131 --> 17:30.465
BECKETT: I just need
a couple of minutes
to finish my work...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.467
You're not helping by
standing there.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.638
You've got five minutes
to get it going, or I'm
leaving it.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.935
Everything in here has
been double-checked
and triple-checked

17:42.019 --> 17:44.187
and cleared for takeoff.
Leave it alone.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.981
Look, Colonel,
I don't answer to you.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.733
He said the same to me, sir.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.152
That's what
your side arm's for.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.448
So the eight-chevron address
is what tells our gate

17:54.532 --> 17:56.408
to look for a point in space
outside of our galaxy,

17:56.492 --> 17:58.660
so we won't know
until it locks.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.249
Are we there yet?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.168
We're just waiting
on Dr. McKay.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.421
It should work now.
I've got it.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.922
Okay, Sergeant,
give it a try.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.468
The ZPM should light up when
it senses a conductive
connection to the gate.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.102
Oh, yeah.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.564
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

18:39.410 --> 18:40.660
Colonel.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.542
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

18:54.217 --> 18:56.468
WEIR:
All right, here we go.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.970
We're about to try
to make a connection.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.766
We have been unable to predict
exactly how much power this is
going to take,

19:02.850 --> 19:05.060
and we may only get
the one chance at this.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.230
So if we're
able to achieve
a stable wormhole,

19:08.314 --> 19:11.233
we're not going to risk
shutting the gate down.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.736
We'll send in
the MALP robot probe,
check for viability and go.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.906
Everything in one shot.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.412
Now, every one of you
volunteered for this mission,

19:24.497 --> 19:26.665
and you represent
over a dozen countries.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.417
You are the world's
best and brightest.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.964
And in light of the adventure
we are about to embark on,

19:34.924 --> 19:36.925
you're also the bravest.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.387
I hope we all
return one day
having discovered

19:40.471 --> 19:43.473
a whole new realm
for humanity to explore.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.559
But as all of you know,

19:47.436 --> 19:49.980
we may never be
able to return home.

19:52.441 --> 19:56.862
I'd like to offer you all
one last chance to withdraw
your participation.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.467
You are not here
by my choice.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.804
I'm sure you'll warm up to me
once you get to know me, sir.

been so excited

22:01.654 --> 22:03.363
Environmental sensors say
there's oxygen.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.740
No measurable toxins.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.368

not getting out of this.

Dr. Weir,
you have to see this.

27:30.274 --> 27:33.735
I have a lot of things
to see. Just be careful.

27:45.748 --> 27:47.165
I didn't touch anything.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.752
Relax, Major. It's like
the entire complex is
sensing our presence

27:50.836 --> 27:52.003
and coming to life.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.629
This has got to
be the control room.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.423
This is obviously
their version of a DHD.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.674
Obviously.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.010
This area could be

possibly
a computer interface...

Right.

Dr. Weir, Colonel Sumner.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.224
Could you come down
and meet me, please?

28:05.309 --> 28:06.726
We're three levels
down from you.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.186
Right away.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.734
We've only been able to secure
a fraction of the place.
It's huge.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.195
So it might really be
the lost city of Atlantis?

28:17.279 --> 28:18.696
I'd say that's a good bet.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.239
Oh, my God.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.750
We're underwater.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.045
SUMNER: I'd say
we're under several
hundred feet of ocean.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.923
If we can't dial out,
this could be a problem.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.049

28:38.133 --> 28:39.092
We're underwater.

28:39.176 --> 28:40.885
Yes, I was just
coming to tell you.

28:40.969 --> 28:44.514
Fortunately, there's some sort
of a force field holding back
the water.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.435
Boy, that is impressive,
isn't it?

28:53.899 --> 28:58.111
Dr. Beckett has found
something you should see.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.496
...in the
hope of spreading
new life in a galaxy

29:08.580 --> 29:10.957
where there
appeared to be none.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.252
Soon, the new life
grew and prospered.

29:16.338 --> 29:19.298
It's a hologram.
The recording loops.

29:19.383 --> 29:20.925
This is my
second time through.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.469
What have we missed?
Not much.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.097
...exchange
knowledge and friendship.

29:26.181 --> 29:30.768
In time, a thousand worlds
bore the fruit of life
in this form.

29:31.687 --> 29:36.315
Then one day, our people
set foot upon a dark world
where a terrible enemy slept.

29:37.151 --> 29:41.279
Never before had
we encountered beings with
powers that rivaled our own.

29:41.363 --> 29:45.324
In our overconfidence,
we were unprepared
and outnumbered.

29:45.409 --> 29:48.703
The enemy fed upon
the defenseless human
worlds like a great scourge

29:48.787 --> 29:51.622
until finally,
only Atlantis remained.

29:51.707 --> 29:56.544
This city's great shield was
powerful enough to withstand
their terrible weapons.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.464
But here, we were
besieged for many years.

29:59.882 --> 30:02.592
In an effort to save
the last of our kind,

30:02.676 --> 30:05.595
we submerged our great city
into the ocean.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.848
The Atlantis Stargate
was the one and only
link back to Earth

30:08.932 --> 30:10.349
from this galaxy.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.977
And those who remained
used it to return to
that world

30:13.061 --> 30:14.770
that was once home.

30:14.855 --> 30:20.109
There, the last survivors
of Atlantis lived out the
remainder of their lives.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.653
This city was
left to slumber,

30:22.988 --> 30:26.574
in the hope
that our kind
would one day return.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.663
So the story of
Atlantis is true.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.291
The great city
that sank in the ocean.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.043
BECKETT: It just didn't
happen on Earth.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.419
Well, the ancient
Greeks must have heard it

30:38.504 --> 30:40.213
from one of the
surviving Ancients.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.716
I don't like the fact
they got their asses kicked.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.719
BECKETT: Let's see it again
from the beginning.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.763
Stop. Turn it off.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.141
Power levels
throughout the city
are dropping like a stone.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.351
What does that mean?

30:53.435 --> 30:56.896
If we don't stop everything
we're doing right now,
we are dead.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.279
Please tell me
this is not my fault.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.697
No.
Thank you.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.157
From what we've
been able to ascertain,

31:08.242 --> 31:10.952
the city is powered by
three Zero-Point Modules.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.955
Two are entirely depleted,
and the third is reaching
maximum entropy.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.707
When it does,
it will die, too, and
nothing can reverse that.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.960
Just tell me
the bottom line.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.796
The force field
holding back the ocean

31:21.880 --> 31:24.465
has collapsed
to its minimum
sustainable levels.

31:24.550 --> 31:28.219
Look, you can see
here and here

31:28.303 --> 31:30.721
where the shield's already
failed and the city's flooded.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.223
McKAY: It could've
happened years ago.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.517
This section is
likely more protected
because of the stargate.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.310
What if it fails completely?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.145
It's a matter of "when,"
not "if."

31:38.647 --> 31:41.899
Colonel Sumner,
you need to order
your security teams

31:41.984 --> 31:43.734
to stop searching
the city immediately.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.821
All security teams
fall back to the gate room.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.489
That's not going
to be good enough.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.575
All right,
how much time do we have?

31:50.659 --> 31:52.243
It's hard to say.
Hours, maybe days,

31:52.327 --> 31:54.120
if we minimize
power expenditure.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.496
What about our
own power generators?

31:55.581 --> 31:56.747
We're working on that.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.000
Even with our most advanced
naquadah-powered generators,

31:59.084 --> 32:00.626
the equations are
coming up far short.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.420
So we need to
find more ZPMs.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.463
How do we do that if
we can't search the city?

32:04.548 --> 32:07.008
If there were more here,
we'd be able to detect them.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.010
Can we use the stargate?

32:09.094 --> 32:12.013
There's nowhere near enough
power to open a wormhole
back to Earth.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.390
Maybe somewhere
in this galaxy.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.560
That's relatively easy.

32:19.479 --> 32:23.149
Fortunately, some ancient
technology still uses good,
old-fashioned push buttons,

32:23.233 --> 32:25.401
so we've been able to access
the stargate control system

32:25.485 --> 32:27.320
and a library of
known gate addresses
in the database.

32:27.404 --> 32:29.322
That's not all.
Look at this.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.286
Just like the iris on
the Earth gate.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.080
Using power.
Using power.
Using power.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.292
At least
we don't have to deal
with any uninvited guests.

32:41.376 --> 32:42.960
Colonel, assemble a team.

32:43.045 --> 32:46.380
We need safe harbor,
or better still,
another power source.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.967
Lieutenant Ford, gather
security teams one and
two. Everyone gear up.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.469
Major, I'd like
you to go along.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.012
Yes, ma'am.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.224
All right, pick an address.
Start dialing.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.524
Chevron one encoded.

33:06.568 --> 33:07.735
Rodney.

33:09.071 --> 33:10.154
Fine.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.415
Ready MALP 4
for off-world recon.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.697
The MALP reads full viability

33:52.781 --> 33:55.116
and no immediate
signs of activity
around the stargate,

33:55.200 --> 33:56.826
but it's pitch black.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.452
For now, we're going to use

33:58.537 --> 34:02.248
the tried-and-true system for
identification of inbound
gate travelers.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.545
Let's move out!

35:03.602 --> 35:04.852
(GRUNTING)

35:07.606 --> 35:09.482
Please, don't hurt us.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.740
Please!
They're just playing.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.037
Everything okay here,
Sheppard?

35:23.121 --> 35:26.123
Yes, sir.
Just a couple of kids.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.636
Halling.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.264
I don't know
what that means.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.058
It's his name.

35:44.684 --> 35:45.643
Oh!

35:45.727 --> 35:48.062
Halling,
it's nice to meet you.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.065
Are you here to trade?

35:51.149 --> 35:52.399
Trade.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.611
Yes. We're traders.

36:00.158 --> 36:04.578
Now, how many times have
I told you not to play
in the forest after dark?

36:08.375 --> 36:09.959
I'm just glad you're safe.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.011
Teyla will wish
to meet with you.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.222
Come.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.477
SUMNER: Parker, Smitty,
you're on gate duty.

36:28.562 --> 36:31.522
Dial Atlantis base
and let the good doctor
know we've made contact

36:31.606 --> 36:33.732
with the indigenous people.

36:40.574 --> 36:43.033
Sir, if you don't
mind my asking,

36:43.118 --> 36:46.412
I noticed you've got
a problem with Major
Sheppard.

36:46.663 --> 36:49.039
My problem, Lieutenant,
is with his record.

36:49.124 --> 36:52.626
I don't like
anybody who doesn't follow
the proper chain of command.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.129
Yes, sir.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.425
What was that
mask you had on?

36:59.718 --> 37:01.969
It helps you see in the dark.
Check it out.

37:03.513 --> 37:04.555
Whoa!

37:04.639 --> 37:06.015
Let me see.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.851
Whoa!
Can I have it?

37:08.935 --> 37:11.478
No. What's the mask
you got on?

37:11.813 --> 37:13.439
This? Wraith.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.150
Wraith? What's that?

37:16.860 --> 37:18.402
You don't know?

37:18.486 --> 37:20.279
What world do
you come from?

37:20.697 --> 37:22.364
Can we go there?

37:22.449 --> 37:23.741
Afraid not.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.327
I come from
a galaxy far, far away.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.716
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

37:48.350 --> 37:51.101
HALLING: It's Halling.
I bring men from away.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.394
Enter.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.247
These men wish to trade.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.582
(EXCLAIMS)

38:13.667 --> 38:16.168
It's nice to meet you.

38:18.380 --> 38:21.840
I am Teyla Emmagan,
daughter of Tagan.

38:23.134 --> 38:27.846
Colonel Marshall Sumner,
Major Sheppard,
Lieutenant Ford.

38:28.682 --> 38:30.474
SUMNER: We have very
few specific needs.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.893
We do not
trade with strangers.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.103
Is that a fact?

38:34.187 --> 38:37.398
Well, then
we'll just have to
get to know each other.

38:38.775 --> 38:42.653
Me, I like Ferris wheels
and college football.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.447
Anything that goes more
than 200 miles per hour.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.992
Sir, that's not going
to mean anything to them.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.159
Feel free to speak up.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.911
I'm just trying to
break the ice here.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.371
These people
can't help us.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.581
I'd rather not
waste our time.

38:54.666 --> 38:58.585
Each morning before dawn,
our people drink a stout tea

38:58.670 --> 39:00.671
to brace us
for the coming day.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.048
Will you join us?

39:06.761 --> 39:08.762
I love a good cup of tea.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.391
Now there's another
thing you know about me.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.437
We're practically
friends already.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.087
BATES: We didn't even know
it was there until the
sun came up.

39:42.172 --> 39:45.632
Looks more promising than
anything else these folks
have to offer.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.635
Plenty of shelter,
nice little valley.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.806
Location, location,
location.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.105
The city of
the ancestors is not safe.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.690
We can handle ourselves.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.317
The Wraith will come.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.194
Who are these Wraith?

40:08.323 --> 40:11.158
We have never met anyone
who did not know.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.911
You have now.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.749
If the Wraith have
never touched your world,
you should go back there.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.001
We'd like to but we can't.

40:22.170 --> 40:25.506
See, here's the thing, ma'am,
we've got ourselves into
a bit of a bind,

40:25.590 --> 40:28.759
and we may need a safe place
to stay for a while.

40:30.512 --> 40:33.388
Our people have long believed
that the Wraith will come

40:33.473 --> 40:35.599
if we venture
into the old city.

40:35.683 --> 40:39.353
But it is a belief we've not
tested in some time.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.817
Gentlemen.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.118
Look, I don't care
what they say.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.120
That city is
worth a look.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.248
Not to mention the possibility
there could be ZPMs there

40:59.332 --> 41:01.083
that they don't
know or care about.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.462
What if the Wraith are
the enemy the Ancient
hologram lady

41:05.547 --> 41:06.588
is talking about?

41:06.673 --> 41:09.049
All the more reason for us
to have a defensible position

41:09.134 --> 41:11.135
should we have
to abandon Atlantis.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.804
Stay here and
find out what you can.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.931
Ford, you head back to the
gate and report in to Weir.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.433
Tell her we'll have
answers for her
in a few hours.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.394
Yes, sir.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.655
Well, I guess it's
just you and me.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.242
And him.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.831
Your leader looks through
me as if I were not there.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.250
Do I?

41:46.421 --> 41:47.421
No.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.842
You truly cannot
return to your world?

41:52.218 --> 41:53.510
No.

41:53.595 --> 41:56.305
Then there is
something you should see.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.442
How much
further is this place?

42:09.319 --> 42:10.527
Not far.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.121
Tell me some good news,
Rodney.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.748
I can't do that.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.334
The shield has held back
the ocean for centuries.

42:25.418 --> 42:29.087
And probably would've
kept going for years more,
but our arrival changed that.

42:29.172 --> 42:31.882
Now it's nothing more
than a thin shell between
the buildings and the water.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.218
We stopped exploring.
The damage was already done.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.970
Another section of the city
on the far side was flooded
an hour or so ago.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.931
Even occupying this room
is draining power.

42:39.015 --> 42:42.017
We need to evacuate the moment
Colonel Sumner reports back
it's safe.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.186
You're saying we have
to abandon the city?

42:44.270 --> 42:45.520
(RUMBLING)

42:47.398 --> 42:50.567
The sooner we leave,
the longer that shield holds.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.660
I used to play
here as a child.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.871
I believe this is
where the survivors
hid from the Wraith

43:02.956 --> 43:04.831
during the last great attack.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.334
Let me...

43:10.088 --> 43:12.172
We mastered fire long ago.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.341
I guess so.

43:38.032 --> 43:39.241
What's this?

43:42.829 --> 43:44.705
I lost this years ago.

43:46.666 --> 43:49.126
How did you...
It was just lying
right over there.

43:49.210 --> 43:51.545
It was reflecting
off the light.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.063
Someone's been busy.

44:11.149 --> 44:14.151
The drawings in
the caves are extensive.

44:15.069 --> 44:18.655
Many must date back
thousands of years or more.

44:21.451 --> 44:24.244
Does this represent the
destruction of your city?

44:25.038 --> 44:27.247
This drawing
far predates that.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.918
So, what? Someone knew
it was going to happen?

44:32.253 --> 44:36.256
I believe it happens
again and again.

44:38.176 --> 44:41.470
The Wraith allow our
kind to grow in numbers.

44:41.929 --> 44:44.514
And when that number
reaches a certain point,

44:44.599 --> 44:49.102
they return to
cull their human herd.

44:49.771 --> 44:53.357
Sometimes, a few hundred years
will pass before they
awaken again.

44:53.441 --> 44:55.692
We've visited
many, many worlds.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.487
I know of none
untouched by the Wraith.

45:00.531 --> 45:03.533
The last great holocaust
was five generations ago.

45:04.077 --> 45:08.914
But still they
return in smaller numbers
to remind us of their power.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.585
That's a hell
of a way to live.

45:15.630 --> 45:17.756
We move our
hunting camps around.

45:19.509 --> 45:23.887
We try to teach our children
not to live in fear,
but it is hard.

45:24.931 --> 45:27.307
Some of us can
sense the Wraith coming.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.726
That gives us warning.

45:32.397 --> 45:35.190
We should go.
It will be dark soon.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.485
FORD: Man,
days are short here.

45:38.611 --> 45:41.196

Major Sheppard, this is
Colonel Sumner. Come in.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.489
Colonel,
this is Lieutenant Ford.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.908
Major Sheppard is out of
radio range at the moment.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.535
Where the hell is he?

45:46.619 --> 45:49.121

him to see something.

they're on the ground.
They're all around us.

Teyla?

47:51.619 --> 47:53.620
They're not really there.

47:58.209 --> 47:59.376
Do not trust your eyes.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.003
The Wraith can make you
see things that are not there.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.631
We must hurry.

Colonel, this is Sheppard.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.395
What you see on the ground
is just an illusion.

I can't find my father.

50:07.672 --> 50:08.922
Here it comes.

50:09.423 --> 50:11.049
What am I looking for?

50:12.468 --> 50:16.054
There. Another part
of the force field
just failed.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.890
I don't think
we have much time.

50:24.522 --> 50:26.022
How are we doing?

50:26.107 --> 50:28.858
Look, if we can just buy
ourselves another day,
maybe we could...

50:28.943 --> 50:32.445
The city is sacrificing
parts of itself in order
to maintain these main areas,

50:32.530 --> 50:34.656
but catastrophic
failure is inevitable.

50:37.284 --> 50:39.119
Not in my wildest
dreams did I hope to find

50:39.203 --> 50:42.414
the lost city of the Ancients
so completely untouched,

50:42.498 --> 50:45.959
so pristine,
and we have no choice
but to walk away from this?

50:46.043 --> 50:47.293
In order to save it.

50:47.378 --> 50:48.795
To save it for whom?

50:48.879 --> 50:51.005
We don't have enough power
to send a message.

50:51.090 --> 50:52.382
As far as Earth is concerned,

50:52.466 --> 50:54.217
we're just going to be
missing, presumed lost.

50:54.301 --> 50:57.095
We'll be back. We'll find
a power source somewhere
in Pegasus.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.930
We have yet to hear
from Colonel Sumner.

50:59.014 --> 51:00.306
We have no idea
what's out there.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.642
We can't wait.
It is time to go, now.

51:11.527 --> 51:14.696
Attention, all personnel.
This is Weir.

51:14.780 --> 51:16.114
(RUMBLING)

51:16.991 --> 51:19.743
Stand by for
immediate evacuation.

51:19.827 --> 51:21.119
Dial the gate.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.793
We've got
an incoming wormhole.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.883
I'm reading
Lieutenant Ford's
identification code.

51:34.967 --> 51:36.050
Let them in.

51:43.768 --> 51:47.020
Step in, folks.
Move away from
the puddle.

51:49.273 --> 51:50.523
Major Sheppard.

51:53.152 --> 51:55.361
Major Sheppard,
who are all these people?

51:56.322 --> 51:58.865
Survivors from the settlement.
We were attacked.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.617
Sumner and some of
our men were taken.

52:00.701 --> 52:02.118
What's going on?

52:02.203 --> 52:04.370
We are in no position
to help anyone right now.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.663
What the hell's going on here?

52:05.748 --> 52:07.332
We were about to
abandon the city.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.125
Going back there
is a really bad idea.

52:09.210 --> 52:10.794
Major Sheppard,
the shield is about to fail

52:10.878 --> 52:12.754
and the ocean
is about to come
crashing in on us.

52:12.838 --> 52:14.297
Do you have a better
place for us to go?

52:14.381 --> 52:16.674
Jinto, you have another
address we can gate to?

52:16.759 --> 52:18.092
Yes, many.

52:19.345 --> 52:20.553
He's just a boy.

52:21.388 --> 52:22.514
I am Jinto.

52:22.598 --> 52:23.890
She's pleased to meet you.

52:25.851 --> 52:26.976
(BEEPING)

52:27.061 --> 52:28.770
The shield is collapsing.

52:28.854 --> 52:30.313
(EXPLOSION)

52:32.316 --> 52:34.192
(RUMBLING)

52:42.743 --> 52:44.369
I'm dialing an address.

52:45.746 --> 52:48.081
WEIR: No, wait.
She's right.

52:52.545 --> 52:53.795
We're moving!

54:11.749 --> 54:13.291
We're on the surface.

54:21.175 --> 54:23.092
I was hoping
for another day.

54:24.053 --> 54:27.013
It looks like we just got
a whole lot more than that.

54:28.641 --> 54:30.099
Let's not waste it.

54:47.868 --> 54:50.787
People, listen up.
No one gets to sit
down until they clear

54:50.871 --> 54:52.622
two pieces of
equipment off
this deck.

54:52.706 --> 54:53.957
Now, let's go.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.753
McKAY: The
last Zero-Point
Module is depleted,

54:58.837 --> 55:00.755
but limited power
has returned

55:00.839 --> 55:02.757
now that our generators
aren't gonna hold back
an ocean.

55:02.841 --> 55:04.384
Life support systems
are working,

55:04.468 --> 55:06.177
but the planet's
atmosphere is breathable,

55:06.261 --> 55:08.763
notwithstanding
the inevitable allergens.

55:08.847 --> 55:11.224
So now, could our
naquadah generator
supply enough power

55:11.308 --> 55:12.642
to the shield for
defensive purposes?

55:12.726 --> 55:13.768
Not even close.

55:13.852 --> 55:16.771
On the surface
without a shield?
We're target practice.

55:16.855 --> 55:18.022
I'm acutely aware of that,
Major.

55:18.107 --> 55:19.857
But thank you
for reinforcing it.

55:20.401 --> 55:23.820
When can you tell me where
the Wraith took Colonel Sumner
and the others?

55:23.904 --> 55:25.905
Even with the six symbols
Lieutenant Ford provided,

55:25.990 --> 55:27.490
there are still
hundreds of permutations...

55:27.574 --> 55:29.534
720.
Yes.

55:30.244 --> 55:33.121
I knew that, of course.
I'm just surprised you did.

55:33.205 --> 55:36.249
Take away the coordinates
you can't get a lock on,
and that's your one.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.001
When you find it,
send a MALP.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.256
Major? A word.

55:59.940 --> 56:01.357
(EXCLAIMS)

56:13.454 --> 56:14.746
Let me guess.

56:15.122 --> 56:17.665
You're not going
to let me rescue
my people.

56:20.294 --> 56:22.462
Major, you don't even
know if they're alive.

56:22.546 --> 56:25.006
You don't leave people
in the hands of the enemy.

56:25.090 --> 56:27.842
And the fact
that we are having
this conversation in private

56:27.926 --> 56:30.887
lets me know that you know
damn well that it's wrong.

56:30.971 --> 56:33.389
And it will totally undermine
your leadership.

56:33.474 --> 56:35.058
So as ranking
military officer...

56:35.142 --> 56:38.352
All right, just shut up and
listen to me for a moment,
all right?

56:39.980 --> 56:42.315
Come on, what do we know
about the Wraith?

56:42.399 --> 56:44.150
One of the few
things we do know is

56:44.234 --> 56:47.236
that they are the enemy
that defeated the Ancients.

56:48.030 --> 56:50.490
When we first began
to use the stargate
we found on Earth,

56:50.574 --> 56:52.158
we got ourselves into
serious trouble. Why?

56:52.242 --> 56:53.451
I don't need
a history lesson.

56:53.535 --> 56:55.244
'Cause the people in
charge didn't consider

56:55.329 --> 56:57.080
the ramifications
before they reacted.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.165
They took our people.
How am I supposed to react?

56:59.249 --> 57:02.168
And we're defenseless.
You said so yourself.

57:02.252 --> 57:05.254
How do you know
going off on some
half-assed rescue mission

57:05.339 --> 57:08.049
isn't going to bring them
all right back here
to our doorstep?

57:08.133 --> 57:09.342
Maybe it will.

57:10.094 --> 57:12.136
But it's the right
thing to do. Why?

57:12.221 --> 57:14.222
Because it is.

57:14.598 --> 57:16.015
John.
If we're not going to do this,

57:16.100 --> 57:18.893
and I mean right now,
let's just turn tail
and pack up.

57:18.977 --> 57:21.104
Because they're coming.
You don't know that.

57:21.188 --> 57:25.149
Our people are in the
hands of the enemy, Doctor.
Do you know what that means?

57:25.943 --> 57:28.569
It is just a matter of time
before the Wraith figure out

57:28.654 --> 57:30.404
that this is
the base of our operation.

57:30.489 --> 57:32.365
I just need more information.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.660
I mean, who knows? Maybe we
could negotiate a peaceful...

57:35.744 --> 57:37.495
Peaceful? Are you kidding?

57:37.913 --> 57:41.249
We weren't there for
more than a few hours
before they showed up.

57:41.333 --> 57:43.960
Is it possible they
came because of you?

57:45.212 --> 57:48.422
And that one of these people
you brought back here with
you tipped them off?

57:48.507 --> 57:49.590
It's possible.

57:49.675 --> 57:53.010
See, that is exactly
the kind of snap decision
I'm referring to.

57:53.095 --> 57:55.555
They're not all bad people.

57:57.724 --> 58:01.352
And you know, if we're going
to stick around here,
we need friends.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.901
Okay, I see your point.

58:10.070 --> 58:11.571
Now, you see mine.

58:13.782 --> 58:16.993
I will not authorize a rescue
mission unless I am sure

58:17.077 --> 58:19.912
there's at least
a remote chance of success.

58:20.747 --> 58:24.208
I'm not sending more good
people, including you,
to their deaths.

58:25.252 --> 58:26.377
Okay.

58:43.145 --> 58:44.562
Are you all right?

58:44.646 --> 58:46.105
Where are we?

58:47.316 --> 58:49.150
Any idea what to expect?

58:52.070 --> 58:53.321
No.

58:53.405 --> 58:55.615
Your friend was the one
who said the Wraith would come

58:55.699 --> 58:57.241
if we went down
into the ruins.

58:57.326 --> 58:59.076
Perhaps you should
have heeded his warning.

58:59.161 --> 59:01.746
How do I know he's not
the one who told them?

to explain themselves.

It's in space.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:38.175
It's in high orbit around
a planet on the far side
of the galaxy.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.969
You're sure this
is the right address?

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.971
It's the only one
we could get a lock on.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.517
Very well.
Shut it down.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.561

(DOOR OPENING)

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:49.538
Dr. Beckett,
what was it you
wanted me to see?

01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:04.095
These cells have none of
the normal human inhibiting
proteins whatsoever.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.890
That gives them an
incredible ability
to regenerate.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.310
What about the movement
Major Sheppard saw?

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.562
As far as
independent behavior,

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:17.066
I'd say that anything he saw
was caused by a residual
command language

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.402
in the severed nerve endings.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.278
All right, anything else?

this arm belonged to,

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:31.956

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.709
As long as the cells
are properly nourished,

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:39.880
I don't see a life form
like this ever dying of
natural aging the way we do.

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.675
And they'd be
bloody hard to kill.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.427

the sound of that.

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:20.332
Did you do that?

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:23.210
I was just wondering
where we go from here.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.629
I'll take that as a yes.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.007
So, how do we find
them once we land?

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:30.259
Now, I've been
thinking about that, too.

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:42.521
Now I'm thinking about
a nice turkey sandwich.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.194
Worth a try.

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:51.405
(THUNDER CLAPPING)

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:12.551
(EXHALES)

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.844
Lock and load.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:17.032
All right, teams of two.
Learn what you can, lay down
their defenses as you see fit.

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:20.035
I want to be able to
light this place up
if we have to.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.037
Two clicks,
you're clear to talk.
Yes, sir.

01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:24.123
Do not engage the enemy.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:26.041
You're with me.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.254
(WHOOSHING)

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:20.804
You must feel hunger by now.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:38.654
I thought getting in
was going to be
the hard part.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.783
That's the first one
we've seen.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:52.252
SHEPPARD: The moving dot
should be him.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:55.046
Go over there.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:08:59.926
Yeah, that's you.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:03.263
So, we've got ourselves
a life-signs detector.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.308
We can name it later.

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:17.236
TEYLA: Major.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.319
(SHUSHING)

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:22.491
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:23.742
Is my son alive?

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:25.327
He's well and
waiting for you.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.037
Where's Colonel Sumner?

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.790
He was taken
by the Wraith.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.124
We don't know where.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:32.376
How about when?

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.169
Not long.

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:35.837
I knew something had
to go wrong.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.923
STACKHOUSE: This is
Stackhouse. Go ahead, sir.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.925
How about a diversion
in a little bit?

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.885
SHEPPARD: You're going to need
to make some noise out there.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.261
Yes, sir.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.223
Rig up enough
C-4 to blow a hole

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.684
and get these
people out of here
on my signal, all right?

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.018
I can find
the Colonel with this.

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.104
There aren't that
many Wraith around.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:54.273
I should be
able to do this.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:57.860
If I'm not back in 20 minutes,
blow the cells and get out.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.404
You're the only one
who can fly these people
out of here.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:03.031
I'm going to fly
us all out of here,
including the Colonel.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:05.242
I'm saying I should
be the one to go, sir.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.452
20 minutes,
I'll find him.

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:15.294
What do you call yourself?

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:20.424
Colonel Marshall Sumner,
United States Marine Corps.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.803
So little fear.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.347
Is it valor

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.268
or ignorance?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.355
We travel
through the stargate
as peaceful explorers.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.940
You must eat.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:40.527
Yet you resist your hunger.
Why?

01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:42.571
Why have you taken
my people prisoner?

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:45.365
You trespassed upon
our feeding ground.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.039
Feeding ground?

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:55.250
All living things must eat.

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:58.712
In this,
I am sure we are similar.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:01.590
You feel hunger even now.

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:04.509
I can sense it.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.679
Yet you resist.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:09.973
Why?

01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:11.516
Why do you care?

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.770
Hunger

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.191
is distasteful.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.239
It looks to me like the food
didn't agree with him.

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:30.160
There we are
quite dissimilar,
Colonel Sumner.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.871
We don't require

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:37.918
our food to agree with us.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:55.936
What do you
call your world?

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.734
What do you
call your world?

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.654
(VOICE DISTORTING)
What do you call your world?

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:10.701
Earth.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:15.330
It is not among our stars.

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:18.750
No.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.669
Tell me of Earth.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:25.424
How many more are
there of your kind?

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.427
Thousands?

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:30.762
Millions?

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.391
More.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:41.064
Our feeding ground
has not been so rich

01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:43.859
in 10,000 years.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.925
Your will is strong.

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:11.636
This one

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.098
begged for its life.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:19.352
Is that the kind of treatment
I can expect for myself and
my people?

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.022
As I've said,

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:25.025
all living things must eat.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.277
Then we're done talking.

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:29.237
I think not.

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.449
Kneel.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.248
Kneel.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:48.048
I have not tasted
such strength

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.550
in so long.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.056
Go to hell.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.851
Earth first.

from you before you tell
us what I wish to know?

(GROANS)

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.576

Where is this
new feeding ground?

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.883
I won't.

Bring him.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:53.965
How's the hand feeling?

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.889
Much better.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.891
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.277
How did this
come to you?

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:16.154
I don't remember.

(SNARLING)

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.580

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:50.021
That has to kill you.

How'd you find me?

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:05.036
Tread marks. Standard issue.
Sir, let's go.

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:08.039
WRAITH: You don't know
what you have done.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:13.878
We are merely the caretakers
for those that sleep.

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:16.381
When I die,

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:19.301
the others will awaken.

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:24.389
(VOICE DISTORTING)
All of them.

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:36.818
What's she talking about?
How many are left?

(RAPID BEEPING)

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:53.376
Sir, we need to leave.

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:55.670
Base, we're on the go.

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.088
STACKHOUSE: So are we.
Colonel Sumner?

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.423
Negative.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:04.637
McKAY: Dr. Weir,

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:08.516
we're getting
reports in from
all over the city.

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.685
There's some pretty
interesting stuff.

01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:14.397
We've only been able to
provide power to certain
sections, but even then,

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:16.733
the things that are
coming up are just...

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.571
I should never
have let them go.

01:18:23.783 --> 01:18:27.702
For what it's worth,
you made the right decision.

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:31.539
Give them time.

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:42.801
Major, the Jumper is
secure for the moment,
but we have a big problem.

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:45.053
Lieutenant, take our six.

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:47.222
I'm going to take
them back to the Jumper.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.057
I'll be right behind you.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.206
There's nothing there.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.666
I'm sure I saw something.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.209
Only what the Wraith
wish you to see.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:17.919
Firing your weapon
will reveal our position.

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.421
Come on.

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:26.845
Get in!

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:00.503
Thank you, sir.

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:02.589
Let's try not to
make a habit of this.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:17.103
We have incoming!

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.234
Now what am I thinking?

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.453
Everybody okay back there?

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.580
We are well enough.

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.421
I hope that
was the hard part.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:51.346
Crap.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.933
I don't think
we've gotten to
the hard part yet.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:06.110
What can we do?

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:08.530
We're safe as long
as they can't see us.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.031
They don't have to.

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:11.866
There's only one
way for us to go.

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:13.618
The minute we
activate the stargate,

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:17.038
they can start shooting blind
and blow us away
on our approach.

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:19.040
Then how can
we get through?

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:21.876
We'll have to draw them away
from the gate and double back.

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:34.472
Be prepared to dial
the gate on my mark.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:49.237
Do you see anything like
a weapons console over there?

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.589
Try and go invisible again.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.924
I tried. It must be damaged.
Dial the gate.

to punch in your

on these things?

Do we have
an identification code?

a few more seconds!

We're going too fast.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.250
I know.

I guess this is home now.

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:28.396
I guess so.

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:34.986
I'm thinking
of a little place
with an ocean view,

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:37.155
out of the way.

Major, Lieutenant,

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:48.166

merited opening this.

Compliments of

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.424

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.475
You did good, John.

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:07.059
I don't know about that.

Hey, there was no way
you could have saved
Colonel Sumner.

01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:15.526
I have to live with it.

think you were right.

I have made
things much worse.

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:24.952
I haven't made us
many more friends out there.

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.078
No?

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.415
Look around you.

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:38.633
I agree, Major Sheppard.

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:59.153
You have earned
both my friendship
and that of my people.

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:05.701
With our help,
you will make
many more friends.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.499
How come I never
make friends like that?

01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:13.835
You need to get out more.

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:17.755
We're in another galaxy.
How much more out can you get?

01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:20.675
Is there lemon in this?

01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:27.098
One more thing, Major,

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:29.475
something I'd
like you to sleep on.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.852
I have a few
thoughts on it myself...

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.687
Thoughts about what?

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:35.147
Who the members of
your team might be.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.733
My team?

01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:40.611
Well, you are the ranking
military officer now,

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:43.281
or do you need to
be reminded of that?

01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:49.954
We need to
get back out there,
do what we came to do.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:56.627
You realize
that could get us
into all sorts of trouble,

01:26:57.963 --> 01:26:59.046
right?
