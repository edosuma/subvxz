11:04.330 --> 11:06.624
It's fundamental.
Just like my old man always told me,

11:06.707 --> 11:10.628
you should never ever trust cops,
no matter what the circumstance is.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.005
-Your old man's an abusive liar.
-[Pope] I agree with JJ.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.882
Fuck the police.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.342
You goin' to the dark side now?

11:16.425 --> 11:18.052
When's the last time
the police helped us?

11:18.135 --> 11:20.054
Peterkin looked out for me, all right?

11:21.138 --> 11:22.765
Tried to, at least.

11:25.851 --> 11:26.936
They need to know.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.200

-Uh... excuse me, ma'am.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.751
This is not a good time, kid.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.255
Adam, advise if you need air tran.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.965
I know who shot the sheriff.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.012
You stay put.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.514
I'll get a deputy.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.083
[deputy] Let me see your hands.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.710
[officer] John B, do what he says.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.796
Look, I didn't... I didn't do it, okay?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.340
Don't... move.

-Don't move!

12:42.762 --> 12:44.930
-Start the car, Kie!
-[Kie] What? John B?

12:45.014 --> 12:46.682

-[John B] The cops!

12:46.766 --> 12:47.767
-[JJ] Shit!
-[John B] Go!

12:47.850 --> 12:51.312

-[Kie] I'm going! I'm sorry!

12:51.395 --> 12:53.397
-[John B] Go, Kie! Go!
-[deputy] Stop the car!

12:53.481 --> 12:55.149
-Right now!
-What did you do?

12:55.232 --> 12:56.317
Open it.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.169
It's Peterkin's.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.717
Peterkin?
What the hell happened to Peterkin?

13:23.552 --> 13:24.553
She's dead.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.265
She got shot.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.185
[Rose] Jesus! By who?

13:32.895 --> 13:35.314
[sighs] Where are the kids, Rose?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.399
I don't know. They're up in their rooms.

13:39.068 --> 13:39.902
Okay.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.362
[Rose] Ward, who shot her?

13:41.445 --> 13:42.488
I'll be right back.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.989
Where the hell are you going, Ward?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.282
Hey, no! Get back here!

13:45.366 --> 13:48.035
-I need to know what is going on here!
-I don't give two shits

13:48.118 --> 13:49.912
what you need right now, okay?

13:55.376 --> 13:56.752
[Ward sighs]

14:10.140 --> 14:11.475
Is... she alive?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.023
-No?
-No.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.276
Okay.

14:24.113 --> 14:24.947

[Rafe laughs]

14:30.828 --> 14:32.246
[Rafe sighs]

14:34.123 --> 14:37.042
What did you-- what did you tell the cops?
Are they comin' here?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.086
I told them John B did it.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.090
Told them John B did it.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.260
That's good.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.679
Yes, that could work.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.098
Rafe, I need you to go to your room.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.558
I need you to clean up.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.519
Take a shower, all right?
Anybody asks you, you were here,

14:55.603 --> 14:57.438
all day, doin' maintenance
on the Druthers.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.316
-No, Rose knows I wasn't here.
<i>-</i>I will talk to Rose, okay?

15:00.399 --> 15:01.817
Please, just do what I say.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.695
-[Rafe] What about Sarah?
-What about Sarah?

15:04.778 --> 15:05.863
Okay, listen. Sarah--

15:05.946 --> 15:08.073
-Sarah has a big mouth, okay?
-[Ward] Sarah's fine.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.367
-She won't sell the family out.
-No. You don't understand.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.952
-She won't hurt us.
-You didn't see her.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.829
-[Ward] I don't care.
-She's flipping out, Dad.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.539
-Rafe! Stop!
-[Rafe] I have a suggestion--

15:15.623 --> 15:17.207
-What?
-I don't need your help right now.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.126
I didn't need it then.
I don't need it now.

15:19.209 --> 15:22.254
I just need to think!
So, please, go clean up!

15:25.633 --> 15:26.884
You understand, right?

15:28.552 --> 15:29.803
[sighs]

15:31.555 --> 15:33.682
-[exhales deeply]
-[Rafe] You understand?

15:34.391 --> 15:36.810
-[Ward] Understand what, Rafe?
-Why I did it.

15:43.609 --> 15:47.613
You were in trouble,
and I was protecting you.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.867
[sighs]

15:53.452 --> 15:54.370
Okay?

15:55.245 --> 15:57.998
Look, me. Dad.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.544
[sniffles] Rafe.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.300
Not Sarah, okay? It was me.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.437
I'm sorry, uh...

16:24.775 --> 16:26.986
[Ward] I know. Come here. Come on.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.612
Come on, bud.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.365
Come on, bud. I'm sorry.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.368
I love you.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.203
[kisses]

16:36.829 --> 16:37.788
[sighs]

16:37.871 --> 16:39.915
[Ward] I love you, Rafe, so much.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.083
[laughs]

16:41.166 --> 16:42.876
The first thing we gotta do...

16:43.961 --> 16:45.462
is lock this place up.

16:47.631 --> 16:52.094
Suspend the ferry and, uh, set up patrols
from Figure Eight,

16:52.177 --> 16:54.096
all the way to the other side of the cut.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.765
And I want fuckin' posters made,
with a reward.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.935
Ten thousand worth of nautical
from the impound lot.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.938
Ten thousand. Wouldn't be enough
to keep me from killin' that guy.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.983
Twenty-five, then.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.029
That oughta be enough to turn every person
on this island into a lookout.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.428
I know that guy.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.681
He got blood on my car.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.809
-Where was it at?
-Just on the other side of...

18:08.879 --> 18:11.799
Maybe you guys can help,
being the smart ones and all, but...

18:12.091 --> 18:14.426
[sighs] ...who are the cops
going to believe?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.553
Ward Cameron or us?

18:16.637 --> 18:19.890
So the accuser is a bigshot developer,
kind of lord of the island,

18:19.973 --> 18:21.725
got the governor on speed dial
kind of person,

18:21.809 --> 18:23.685
and the accused...

18:24.478 --> 18:25.395
is John B,

18:26.063 --> 18:29.775
who is...
pretty much a homeless 16-year-old boy

18:29.858 --> 18:30.859

18:30.984 --> 18:31.819
Thanks.

Shit.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.696
[JJ] Okay, man.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.407
Yucatan, all right?
I'm saying that's the only option.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.993
-What other option do you have?
-Enough with the Mexico bullshit.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.579
-Sarah will bail me out.
-[Kie] She did witness the whole thing.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.748
-Thank you.
-And she's gonna snitch on her brother?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.126
Not happening, bro. Okay?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.877
We've gotta get you off the island.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.504
[Pope] The ferry. It's the only way.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.549
-Exit stage left while you still can.
-[siren approaching]

18:53.632 --> 18:56.760
-Before the entire island is on lockdown.
-Guys, just get down.

18:58.428 --> 19:02.099
-[Pope] Sarah's not a Pogue, John B.
-[JJ] Yeah. You can't stay here, man.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.018
[Sarah] What's gonna happen to Rafe?

19:10.315 --> 19:11.525
[sighs]

19:12.901 --> 19:14.736
Baby, nothing's gonna happen to Rafe.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.531
Excuse me?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.368
-What do you mean, nothing'll happen?
-Honey--

19:21.451 --> 19:23.287
-That makes no sense!
-I know it seems that way.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.913
-He shot her!
-Listen to me, sweetheart.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.208
You grow up in this world
thinking there is good and there's evil,

19:28.292 --> 19:29.376
and that's how it should be,

19:29.459 --> 19:32.921
because that's helpful when you're young,
when you need some kind of...

19:34.256 --> 19:35.215
structure.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.261
But there reaches a point when you realize
that the world isn't organized

19:39.344 --> 19:41.430
along some divine idea of right and wrong.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.223
It's not. It's something else.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.434
It's family...

19:46.560 --> 19:47.477
and tribe.

19:48.979 --> 19:49.938
Do you understand?

19:50.606 --> 19:52.858
-You have to pick a side, Sarah.
-No.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.693
Him or us.

No. No!

20:12.252 --> 20:13.170
Shit!

20:14.546 --> 20:15.505
Let me out.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.426
-[yells] Let me out! Please!
-Why are you locking her in there?

20:19.509 --> 20:22.137
-Sh. Sweetie...
-[Sarah yells] Dad, please!

20:22.679 --> 20:26.308
...there has been an... accident,
and your sister's very upset,

20:26.391 --> 20:28.602
and she just needs a little time alone
to calm down.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.437
So we're gonna give her that, okay?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.147
You can't lock her in there.

20:32.231 --> 20:36.860
-That's super dysfunctional.
-Wheezie... just go to your room, okay?

20:36.944 --> 20:38.820
-[Wheezie] What did I do?
-Go to your room!

20:46.161 --> 20:47.120
Shit.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.709
[sighs] Okay.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.420
-Okay. All right, no.
-Pope, can you act normal?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.798
[Pope] So, um... okay, so, bad news.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.550
The ferry's closed, and there is this.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.013
-What is that? What is this?
-[Kie] Shit.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.475
Well, John B, uh...
this is a good framer of you.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.896
Okay, so the whole island's
lookin' for John B right now.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.983
-That's a lot of money.
-Congratulations, John B. You're famous.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.610
Guys, we got to get to the HMS.
We need small, no running lights--

21:18.694 --> 21:19.695
It's at the ChÃ¢teau, Kie.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.823
And I wonder if the cops got
the entire place staked out.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.366
Let me think. Oh, yeah. No.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.201
They definitely have
that place locked down.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.037
-[Kie] Yeah, copy that.
-Let me think. Just give me a second.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.415
-JJ.
-[JJ] What?

21:33.292 --> 21:36.169
Does your dad still have that boat?
The cigarette boat, the <i>Phantom.</i>

21:36.253 --> 21:38.213
-The one he used to race.
-Maybe.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.299
You could get right up the coast,
no problem.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.467
-Okay, look.
-[JJ] It won't be easy, Pope.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.595
-The surf's running from three to four.
-[JJ] I don't know where the keys are.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.139
-Well, find them.
-[JJ] I'm thinking.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.850
-Why is nobody moving forward?
-Can you relax?

21:49.933 --> 21:51.601
-JJ, how much weed did you give him?
-Guys.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.520
-Your car's on the poster.
-[beeps horn]

21:53.603 --> 21:54.563
-Can we move it?
-Pope!

21:54.646 --> 21:55.689
-It won't help.
-Mom. Look.

21:55.772 --> 21:56.606
[Pope] Come on!

21:56.690 --> 21:58.942
-Don't honk the horn.
-[boy] It's that guy. Right there.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.487
-Shit.
-We got a snitch. Pope, turn the car on.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.531
-[boy] We get $25,000 if we find him.
-Hey!

22:05.782 --> 22:07.034
He's right there!

22:07.117 --> 22:08.952
-[Kie] Hey! We gotta go!
-[JJ] Turn the car on!

22:09.036 --> 22:11.413
-I found him first!
-Hell you did, you little bastard!

22:11.496 --> 22:13.749
-Pope, turn the frickin' car on!
-I am trying!

22:13.832 --> 22:15.334
-[Kie] Dude--
-Turn the car on!

22:19.463 --> 22:21.048
-[JJ] Hey!
-[Kie] The other way.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.924
[JJ] It's okay! Pope, just go!

22:23.008 --> 22:24.009
-[Kie] Hey!
-[Pope] Sorry!

22:24.551 --> 22:25.385
Hey!

22:25.761 --> 22:27.763
-[Kie] What are you doing?
-[JJ] We'll bump out.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.931
We need backup on a green SUV.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.808
Iota, Kappa, Echo, Foxtrot.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.852
Watch out! Pope!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch out!

22:33.935 --> 22:35.812
-Watch out!
-[laughs]

22:35.896 --> 22:37.481
-Oh, my God!
-Pope!

22:37.564 --> 22:39.816
-What the fuck?
-I'm livin' my best life now.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.193
-My mom'll kill me.
-Oh, my God.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.529
[JJ] I should be the last to say this,
but you are not okay to drive. Stop!

22:44.613 --> 22:45.781
-[tires squeal]
-[JJ] Oh, jeez.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.324
-John B, get out.
-[JJ] He's right.

22:47.407 --> 22:48.909
-We'll draw the cops, you run.
-Shit.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.411
I'll get the rig, and I'll meet you
in the dump tomorrow, okay?

22:51.495 --> 22:52.412
Three o'clock, okay?

22:52.496 --> 22:53.997
-Yeah.
-[JJ] Three tomorrow at the dump.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.332
-Yeah.
-[JJ] Come on, go, go, go!

[sighs]

23:00.754 --> 23:03.423
-[Wheezie] What are you doin'?
-Tossin' this crap.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.884
[Wheezie] That's John B's.

23:05.967 --> 23:09.763
Yeah, well, I don't think he's gonna be by
anytime soon to pick it up, so--

23:09.846 --> 23:10.764
Why?

23:13.058 --> 23:13.975
Did you say why?

23:15.852 --> 23:18.355
-They didn't tell you?
-Nobody tells me anything.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.068
Um...

23:26.071 --> 23:27.280
so, John B...

23:28.990 --> 23:30.200
killed Sheriff Peterkin.

23:31.785 --> 23:32.619
What?

23:32.702 --> 23:33.578
Yeah.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.914
-You smilin' right now?
-Yeah.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.250
I'm not joking. Like, this isn't a game.
I don't--

23:38.333 --> 23:40.585
I don't know why you're smiling, okay?
Look at me.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.712
I saw it with my own two eyes, all right?

23:43.130 --> 23:45.465
He shot her,
and then you know what he did?

23:46.925 --> 23:50.262
He tried to shoot Dad, but I stepped in,
and I stopped him, right?

23:50.345 --> 23:51.430
I saved his life.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.724
Why would John B want to kill Dad?

23:55.225 --> 23:56.601
Uh, because... um...

23:57.936 --> 23:59.646
he thinks Dad killed his father.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.067
He wants vengeance.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.865
Oh, yeah. I don't know.
I'm telling you, he's...

24:11.199 --> 24:13.493
[sighs] ...he's a maniac.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.871
Hm.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.166
And Sarah has been hanging out with him.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.189
Like, that was so bad!

25:25.023 --> 25:26.358
I'm just glad I'm not driving now.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.652
Pull over.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.701
[Kie] JJ, it's not funny.
He shouldn't be driving.

25:36.785 --> 25:37.702
Mama's mad.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.120
What are you--

25:43.375 --> 25:44.376

26:28.044 --> 26:29.337
Man, what are you doin' here?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.131
[John B] I-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

26:31.214 --> 26:33.049
-Man, I know what you did.
-Please listen to me.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.552

-[Pope] Perfectly focused.
-[JJ] You sure this is a good idea?

[Kie] She's the only one
who can clear John B.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.895

27:32.359 --> 27:33.652
[Kie] Okay, I've got a plan.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.488
[Pope] Yeah, I have plans.
We can do plan.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.449
Let's do the plan thing.
Let's get it. Let's plan it out.

-[Pope] Mm.

Mm.

I love you, Kie.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.601
What?

28:07.227 --> 28:09.854
I love you. I'm in love with you.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.023
You're wasted.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.485
[Pope] No, I know I'm wasted,
and that's why I'm saying this now.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.112
I really feel like this. I love you.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.989
-I've been meaning to tell you, I love--
-Are we doing this right now?

28:20.073 --> 28:22.283
-I'm trying to tell you how I feel.
-Pope... Pope!

-Pope! Pope! Pope, sh!
-Hey, I'm tryin' to tell you, I love you.

First of all, I need you to be quiet.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.166
-Okay, yeah. Quiet, I mean--
-No. Stop talking, like, now.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.167
Starting now.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.836
Second of all...

28:34.504 --> 28:35.964
thank you for saying that.

28:36.047 --> 28:36.965
[Pope chuckles] Okay...

28:37.048 --> 28:39.884
Now, that's very sweet, but it's--
Look, it's not gonna happen.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.803
Okay, well, why not?

28:41.886 --> 28:43.722
[Kie] Because Pogues
can't mack on other Pogues.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.807
That rule doesn't make sense,
and nobody follows it.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.018
Look, I-- I want something different.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.272
-[Pope] Okay, I--
-I-- I wanna go to Antarctica,

28:52.355 --> 28:53.606
and I wanna ride camels...

28:53.690 --> 28:56.651
-I want to do those things with you.
-[Kie] No. Pope, it's not gonna work.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.487
-I want to be that person.
-No. It's not gonna happen!

29:01.573 --> 29:03.825
Do you understand what I'm saying? Like...

29:05.785 --> 29:07.912
Look, I know that that's really hard
to hear right now,

29:07.996 --> 29:09.622
but we don't have time for this,

29:11.082 --> 29:13.293
and this is a really bad place to do it.

29:15.962 --> 29:16.963
Are you okay?

29:18.506 --> 29:21.760
-Yeah.
-Are you ready for the plan, or...

I didn't kill the sheriff.

-[Topper] You didn't shoot the sheriff?
-No, I didn't. It was Rafe!

33:10.530 --> 33:12.532
All right? Sarah was there.
She saw the whole thing.

33:12.615 --> 33:14.867
Oh, it was Rafe. Okay. My bad.

wouldn't believe myself either, but...

33:55.908 --> 33:56.784
once.

33:56.868 --> 34:02.415
Okay? But maybe don't use the f-word.
That's kinda gross. Grotesque...

34:02.498 --> 34:04.584
-My bad, man. I'm so sorry.
-...way to describe it.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.919
What word...
what word would you like me to use?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.171
I don't know. Any other word.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.505
Okay, the-- the l-word?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.633
-What l-word?
-Love?

34:15.094 --> 34:15.970
Huh?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.056
-Look, I don't know--
-You love her, or you don't.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.725
-Do you love her?
-I don't know, Top. It's too new, okay?

34:20.808 --> 34:23.352
Okay, well, then...
Okay, what does it feel like?

34:23.436 --> 34:25.855
Huh? What does it feel like
when you're with her?

34:26.773 --> 34:28.274
Does she make you crazy?

34:29.567 --> 34:31.444
Can you sleep at night, like...

34:33.362 --> 34:34.447
[John B] Uh...

34:36.282 --> 34:37.408
I mean, it's-- it's...

34:39.035 --> 34:43.122
it's fun and-- and exciting and...

34:45.166 --> 34:46.667
sometimes it's scary.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.795
Uh, I-- I don't know, man. It's like...

34:50.546 --> 34:54.342
getting struck by lightning
and-- and not getting burned,

34:54.425 --> 34:56.010
-or--
-What the hell are you saying?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.763
I don't know, man. It's like--
It's like we're in a movie, sometimes.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.057
It's like you're in a fuckin' mov--
That's not love!

35:02.850 --> 35:03.976
I'm in love with her,

35:06.187 --> 35:07.313
and I know that hurts...

35:14.112 --> 35:14.987
but, uh...

35:17.323 --> 35:18.574
I'm in love, man.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.496
[siren approaching]

35:23.579 --> 35:26.749
-I'm in love.
-[Topper] It's over for you, man.

35:27.166 --> 35:30.211
This is it. Your little wild adventure.
Your little movie.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.298
Cops are on their way.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.634
Hope you enjoyed it.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.036
[sniffs]

36:04.120 --> 36:06.289
[Rose] Wheezie told me
you locked Sarah in her room.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.499
-What's going on?
-[Ward] I can't right now.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.917

36:12.086 --> 36:13.129
[whispers] Wheezie.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.380
Wheezie?

36:16.966 --> 36:17.884
Wheezie.

36:29.770 --> 36:30.646
Yes.

36:33.941 --> 36:34.942
[whispers] Wheezie.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.237
Wheezie, are you there?

36:39.739 --> 36:40.573
Wheezie?

36:42.450 --> 36:45.536
Damn it! Will you stop writing
in your diary, please?Â Wheezie, please?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.205
Talk to me.

36:49.081 --> 36:51.000
Wheezie, SOS. Please answer me.

36:52.501 --> 36:53.461
Hello?

36:53.544 --> 36:54.545
Sarah?

36:54.629 --> 36:56.130
-[Sarah] Wheezie. Hi.
-[gasps]

36:56.672 --> 36:57.840
Can you believe it?

36:57.924 --> 37:01.427
I mean, you think you know the guy,
but it turns out that he's a killer.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.137
I mean, living in our house.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.681
-It gives me the total creeps.
-I need to talk to you.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.725
[Wheezie] When you see on TV,
and they're, like...

37:07.808 --> 37:08.893
all the neighbors are, like,

37:08.976 --> 37:10.645
-"He's a normal guy."
-[Sarah] No--

37:10.728 --> 37:11.979
-Wheezie!
-[Wheezie] It's crazy!

37:12.063 --> 37:14.440
I mean, my sister dating a killer.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.069
[Wheezie gasping]

37:18.778 --> 37:19.612
[Sarah sobs]

37:19.695 --> 37:21.530
[continues sobbing]

37:22.823 --> 37:25.243
[Wheezie] You don't still have feelings
for John B, do you?

37:25.326 --> 37:26.827
-[Sarah] Of course I do!
-Like--

37:26.911 --> 37:29.747
Like, women who fall in love with guys
on death row?

37:29.830 --> 37:31.582
It's just so horrible!

37:33.334 --> 37:34.919
[sobbing]

37:35.002 --> 37:36.003
Are you crying?

37:36.087 --> 37:37.797
[Sarah] No shit, I'm crying.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.968
I just really need my sister right now.
Can you please come in here?

37:45.012 --> 37:47.515
[sighs] Well, Dad told me
not to open the door.

37:47.598 --> 37:51.060
Okay, well, if you keep the door locked
and you don't say anything, he won't know.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.561
[sobs]

37:52.645 --> 37:54.397
I really need you!

37:54.480 --> 37:55.314

37:59.819 --> 38:00.736

38:03.197 --> 38:04.532
[Sarah] Shh...

38:05.700 --> 38:06.784
[closes door]

38:07.785 --> 38:09.662
[whispers] I need you to listen to me.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.914
John B is not a killer.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.125
He did not shoot anyone.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.626
I was there.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.088
Well, then, who did it?

38:26.554 --> 38:29.765
I need you to stay quiet about me
for as long as you can.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.725
Okay.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.226
John B needs my help.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.020
Can I count on you?

38:34.729 --> 38:36.605
-[Wheezie] Pinky swear.
-[Sarah] Yeah.

38:59.462 --> 39:00.671
Hey, Officer, we got your guy!

39:00.755 --> 39:03.591
Got him locked up in my house.
Got him trapped in my laundry room.

39:03.674 --> 39:04.508
[Shoupe] What?

39:04.592 --> 39:06.010

[Shoupe] All right. What we got?

39:20.066 --> 39:22.360
Haven't gone in yet.
Had to set up the perimeter first.

39:22.443 --> 39:23.527
[Shoupe] Where is he?

39:23.611 --> 39:26.155
He's in the laundry room,
around the corner from the kitchen.

39:26.238 --> 39:27.865
-[Shoupe] This your house?
-Yes, sir.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.742
[Shoupe] Your parents
got him pinned in there?

39:29.825 --> 39:30.951
[Kelce] No, sir, that was me.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.162
But I got my boy Top in there
guardin' him.

39:33.245 --> 39:35.456
-All right. Is he armed?
-No, sir.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.846
I think they've got him trapped
in this house.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.057
It's John B. It's John B Routledge.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.353
All right, John B!

39:57.436 --> 39:58.646
It's Shoupe out here.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.607
We got you surrounded.
We don't want any more bloodshed.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.275
-[sighs] Shit.
-[Shoupe] We're comin' in.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.404
What a misunderstanding, bro.
Like, everyone thinks it's you.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.905
-[John B] I didn't do it.
-Good.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.240

-[door rattling]

40:15.454 --> 40:16.455
[deputy] Want me to lead?

40:17.123 --> 40:19.500
He shot Miss Pete down
like a dog in the street.

40:20.376 --> 40:21.293
I got this.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.257

I'm comin' with you.

40:48.654 --> 40:50.489
All right, sir. He's right in there.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.158
-[Shoupe] All right.
-All right.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.368

40:55.035 --> 40:57.913
-Thomas, get the kid outta here.
-[Thomas] Yeah. I got him.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.293
All right, John B.
This is the end of the road!

41:02.751 --> 41:05.171
Put your hands on your head.
I'm comin' in there!

41:09.175 --> 41:11.385
-[Thomas] Shoupe! You got him?
-Goddamn.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.137
He slipped out the vent
in the laundry room.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.764
[John B grunts, panting]

41:15.848 --> 41:18.350

He went out the back!

41:22.271 --> 41:24.273
[Topper] He was just in there!
He can't be far.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.484
[Shoupe] I want three deputies
to hit the backyard now!

41:26.567 --> 41:28.569
-Come on. Let's go!
-We'll get him for you, Sheriff!

41:28.652 --> 41:30.988
The suspect is unarmed, all right?

41:31.405 --> 41:33.407
If you ain't sheriff's department,
go home.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.576
[Rafe] Come on. Let's find him.
Let's go. Let's go!

41:35.910 --> 41:38.078
Don't you worry, all right?
We're gonna help.

Hey, this way. Let's go.

42:22.498 --> 42:24.124
[Kelce] No other way he could have gone.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.293

44:55.401 --> 44:56.610
What are you talkin' about?

44:56.694 --> 44:58.821
Why would I say
that my own brother did it...

44:59.238 --> 45:00.531
if it wasn't true?

45:02.199 --> 45:05.202
-I was there, Topper.
-Don't lie to me, Sarah.

45:05.285 --> 45:07.496
Sheriff Peterkin
was trying to arrest my father,

45:07.579 --> 45:08.706
and then Rafe shot her.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.458
-No.
-That's my brother.

45:11.542 --> 45:12.918
[siren approaching]

45:13.919 --> 45:15.379
Why would I lie about that?

45:19.049 --> 45:20.592
[Kelce] Yo, I heard the bell.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.098
-Yo, yo.
-[Kelce] Yeah, yeah, that's it.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.642
[Rafe] Shit. Okay. Let's go.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.650
[sirens approaching]

45:36.734 --> 45:37.693
[John B] Shit.

45:41.029 --> 45:42.406
-We've gotta go.
-[Sarah] Yeah.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.908
Sarah, you realize
I'm the one that loves you.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.952
-I don't care right now!
-[Topper] You see--

45:47.411 --> 45:49.204
Do you understand what's going on?

45:54.835 --> 45:55.669
Yo...

45:55.753 --> 45:57.296
-Hey, bro, wait.
-What?

45:57.379 --> 45:58.714
Don't run into an ambush.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.301
I'm sorry for what I did.

46:02.926 --> 46:04.136
I'm sorry,

46:05.053 --> 46:06.472
but this isn't about you.

46:08.557 --> 46:10.517
-Okay?
-What does that mean, Sarah?

46:10.601 --> 46:12.644
Hey, we've gotta go.

46:14.396 --> 46:15.647
Let's smoke him out, then.

46:15.731 --> 46:16.648
Yeah?

46:23.071 --> 46:24.281
Bro, what are you doing?

46:27.326 --> 46:28.535
What are you doing, man?

46:31.705 --> 46:33.874
-Shit.
-Hey, this is war.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.423
Whoo! [laughing]

46:43.467 --> 46:45.427
Sarah, you gotta realize
that he doesn't love you.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.638
-[Sarah] Stop!
-He doesn't love you. It's me that does.

46:47.721 --> 46:49.223
-[John B] Get your hands off her.
-Stop.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.850
He doesn't love you like I do, okay?
And I can prove it.

46:53.268 --> 46:55.813
Sarah, look at me.
Just let me prove it to you.

47:05.531 --> 47:07.115
[radio chatter]

47:07.199 --> 47:09.451
[officer] Shoupe,
fire broke out a few minutes ago.

47:09.952 --> 47:11.370
Okay, folks, back up.

47:11.453 --> 47:13.789
Central, we've got the suspect
in the Old Oak Church chapel.

47:13.872 --> 47:15.624
It's on fire. Send units now.

47:16.041 --> 47:18.335
-[woman] Somebody's in there.
-[Thomas] Get back!

47:18.418 --> 47:19.419
Get back!

47:19.503 --> 47:21.672
Let's get everybody backed up.
Can I get a little help?

47:22.422 --> 47:24.967
-[woman] That's him! The cop killer!
-[Thomas] Back up!

47:25.050 --> 47:27.261
-[man] Get him!
-[Shoupe] On your knees, Routledge!

47:27.344 --> 47:28.303
-Get down!
-[man] John B!

47:28.387 --> 47:30.180
-Hands where we can see 'em!
-[officer] Down!

47:30.264 --> 47:31.473
-Shoot him!
-[Shoupe] Get down!

47:31.557 --> 47:34.560
-Stay back! Routledge, get down!
-[teen] Don't shoot, all right?

47:34.643 --> 47:36.520
-[officer] Get down!
-[Shoupe] Hands up!

47:36.603 --> 47:38.230
-Show me your hands!
-Stand down!

47:38.856 --> 47:39.857
It's Topper.

47:40.315 --> 47:41.942
-[Shoupe] Topper?
-It's Topper. All right?

47:42.025 --> 47:43.569
Just put the guns down, man.

47:44.611 --> 47:45.821
Just put the guns down.

47:47.614 --> 47:49.074
-[glass smashes]
-[John B] Let's go.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.993
God damn it.
What the hell are you doin'?

47:52.703 --> 47:54.872
I don't know what the hell happened
in there, all right?

47:54.955 --> 47:57.708
That's bullshit. I ain't buyin' it.
You need to tell me what's goin' on.

47:57.791 --> 47:59.751
Is this how you treat people
who try to help?

47:59.835 --> 48:01.920
All right, smart-ass.
Thomas! Plumb! Go talk to him.

48:02.004 --> 48:03.422
-Get him in the car.
-[siren wailing]

48:03.505 --> 48:05.465
-[Shoupe] Let's get everybody backed up!
-[grunts]

48:06.300 --> 48:07.843
[Shoupe] There might be people in there!

48:07.926 --> 48:10.304
Somebody get on the bullhorn,
let's get out back.

48:10.387 --> 48:12.222
He's still out there. God damn it.

48:13.098 --> 48:14.600
[sighs]

48:14.683 --> 48:16.685
[John B and Sarah panting]

48:28.322 --> 48:30.240
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]
