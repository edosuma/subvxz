-Why are you asking about Amanda?
-Can't be too careful.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.806
If you're worried about her getting into
the system, why monitor internal traffic?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.109
You think She has a mole.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.236
That's it, isn't it?

Hey. Wake up.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.579
There 's a comm in your ear.
That's why you can hear me.

a very, very unhappy dentist.

Stupid bitch.

Am I in the ballpark?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.424
-This could lead to Amanda.
-I can't talk about this.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.556

16:26.360 --> 16:29.488
Yeah. Owen and Alex

16:29.655 --> 16:31.441
ALEX:
We're fine.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.818
How long before we have to
get Markov back?

16:34.035 --> 16:35.616
Four hours, tops.

16:35.786 --> 16:39.119
Let's get him to Birkhoff's. Start the scan.
We gotta get you changed.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.947
We have to sample his vocals.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.382
Traces of corrosive on the edge.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.751
This was planned.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.347
You sure?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.512
I know my acids.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.436
That mole does not wanna be found.

RYAN: You weren't supposed to say anything.
-I didn't tell him, he guessed.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.361
Why do I get the feeling
you all think I'm an idiot?

17:13.324 --> 17:17.158
Pull all the duty rosters, find out who
had access and start questioning them.

17:17.370 --> 17:21.204
If anybody asks, this was an accident.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.951
Everyone's jumpy already.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.501
Go to the arms locker, get a sidearm.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.004
The mole knows you're on the hunt.

17:34.804 --> 17:38.171
Once the mapping's done, it shouldn't
take long to shape the polymer.

17:38.349 --> 17:41.637
Sampling of his vocals are complete.
How's the hair going?

-...how long will you be in cover?
MICHAEL: Couple of weeks.

18:13.593 --> 18:17.506
Long enough to go to Uzbekistan
and arrange a nice natural death.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.177
I gotta say, I'm not really crazy
about you leaving for so long.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.678

Pitiful.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.365
Percy gave you a gift.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.777
A new life. A chance to serve
your country, and what did you do?

18:42.997 --> 18:45.329
Stop him from moving.
He'll screw up the scan.

18:45.499 --> 18:49.458
You betrayed him. You turned your back
on your duty, and for what?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.171
To play house?

18:51.881 --> 18:55.089
DiviSion used to stand for something.
Now what do they do?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.715
Hunt down and kill their own.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.878
You had a chance to do the right thing
and turn yourself in.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.718
I did the right thing.
With a little help from Amanda.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.431
Amanda?

19:08.022 --> 19:11.560
-She helped me craft a message for you.
-What message?

19:15.821 --> 19:19.655
You know me as Alexi Markov,
duly-elected president of Uzbekistan.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.984
[ON COMPUTER] But for 10 years,
I was an undercover operative...

19:23.204 --> 19:27.163
...with a covert American black-ops group
known as Division.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.992
My public background
and my life, it’s a lie.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.583
I was placed in this country to spy on
and disrupt local government...

19:34.757 --> 19:37.419
...through murder, torture and violence.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.209
Just like I spied on
and disrupted other governments...

19:40.429 --> 19:42.010
...some of them U. S. allies.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.431
The file has a text attachment,
with names, dates, places.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.184
This video gets released
to every major media outlet...

19:49.355 --> 19:52.768
...unless I give my people
a password every morning.

19:53.609 --> 19:58.228
Let me go, or in a few hours,
DiviSion will be exposed to the world.

19:58.614 --> 20:03.199
And the full force and fury
of the US. military will be turned on you.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.447
That's a nice bluff.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.494
I think he knows it's not a bluff.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.788

20:20.803 --> 20:21.963
How did you find out?

20:22.138 --> 20:25.926
Amanda assumed the president would
have a kill contingency in her pocket.

20:26.851 --> 20:30.184
-What the hell is this guy talking about?
MARKOV: It's okay.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.183

What's he mean,

21:23.365 --> 21:26.528

let Division become a liability.

If it does, Special Forces will come in here
and wipe us out.

21:30.831 --> 21:35.040

roster of every agent and where they live.

had to have a contingency.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.348

-Because that's my job.

-Because we're criminals, Michael.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.301

doesn't trust us.

Most of us are ex-prisoners.
Some are convicted killers.

called "internal sanctions."

26:23.665 --> 26:26.998
He remembered your name
from a mission profile a few years ago.

-Yes, I do. Believe me, I do.
