37:01.219 --> 37:03.130
What a lucky guy.

37:06.474 --> 37:10.968
What the textbook left out is that Isis
is also the goddess of the underworld.

37:12.105 --> 37:16.394
She's responsible for bringing
the great god Ra to his knees.

37:17.193 --> 37:20.185
You believe that I would do that to Clark?

37:20.989 --> 37:23.071
Not intentionally.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.988
But I realize now that you're capable of it.

37:30.999 --> 37:34.583
You should just know
that I'm not gonna let that happen.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.173
There's no way to trace
where the alloy disappeared to?

37:50.352 --> 37:53.435
I don't need to remind you
that the properties of that substance...

37:53.605 --> 37:55.061
...weren't exactly conventional.

37:55.231 --> 37:57.938
We just barely started to study it.

37:58.193 --> 38:02.527
Unless you're ready for a front-row seat
to the apocalypse, I suggest we ﬁnd it.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.739
Sir?

38:46.449 --> 38:48.405
I went to see Lex.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.237
He's not gonna press any charges.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.994
If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't
know Lex was still tracking Kryptonians.

39:00.714 --> 39:03.171
At least one good thing
came out of the mess I made.

39:10.724 --> 39:14.182
I wish you wouldn't look at me
like you hadn't seen me before.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.563
I guess I'm just trying to ﬁnd
a part of you I recognize.

39:21.651 --> 39:24.233
Clark, it was the powers.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.521
You have to know
that I would never hurt you.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.816
Even before you had the powers,
Lana, you kidnapped Lionel.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.526
Yes.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.660
But he threatened to kill you.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.200
I was trying to save your life.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.164
And that justiﬁes everything?

39:43.298 --> 39:48.918
I'm not going to apologize for going to
extremes to protect the person that I love.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.015
You sound like Lex.

39:57.604 --> 40:00.016
I sound like you.

40:03.318 --> 40:06.105
You can't tell me that
you haven't crossed the moral line...

40:06.279 --> 40:07.815
...in order to save somebody.

40:11.659 --> 40:14.571
These Iast few weeks
have been so great with you, I just—

40:14.746 --> 40:18.330
-I didn't wanna look below the surface.
-Clark, I'm sorry.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.742
I wanted to be honest with you
about the Isis Foundation, but—

40:21.920 --> 40:24.411
It's never been a part of our relationship.

40:25.507 --> 40:27.839
But I guess that's my fault.

40:28.510 --> 40:32.128
I didn't trust you years ago,
and now, for some reason...

40:32.305 --> 40:34.216
...you can't trust me.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.678
We will ﬁnd our way back from this.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.513
Will we?

40:41.856 --> 40:46.441
I can live with you changing. I just need to
accept the fact that I'm responsible for it.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.062
Don't do that.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.069
Do what?

40:53.326 --> 40:59.196
Take all the blame so that you don't taint
the image of me that you created.

41:00.125 --> 41:04.084
I have to live with the decisions
that I've made.

41:06.422 --> 41:10.040
I just need to know that you love me.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.886
No matter what.
