WEBVTT

00:02.319 --> 00:03.705
- What's up, guys? I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

00:03.729 --> 00:05.078
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

00:05.155 --> 00:08.156
Things are about
to get dangerous...

00:08.234 --> 00:10.658
- ly creative!
- Voices: Yeah!

00:10.736 --> 00:15.239
We are gonna fill these blasters
with different colored paints...

00:15.241 --> 00:18.575
shoot 'em at the canvas...
and make art.

00:18.577 --> 00:20.427
I'm never bored
when I'm with you.

00:20.504 --> 00:21.520
Let's get paintin'!

00:21.597 --> 00:22.504
All right!

00:22.581 --> 00:24.023
Okay.

00:24.099 --> 00:25.507
- (screams)
- (Frankie laughs)

00:25.584 --> 00:27.434
Aah! You're getting it on mine!

00:27.511 --> 00:28.602
Frankie: Psychopath.

00:28.678 --> 00:31.755
Ohh! My gosh!

00:31.757 --> 00:34.366
- I'm sorry!
- Okay!

00:34.443 --> 00:36.329
- And now, we are going to be art critics.
- All right.

00:36.353 --> 00:38.595
Let's start with this wonderful
piece of expression.

00:38.597 --> 00:42.616
All right, um, I call this
"Storm Mother." -(thunder crashes)

00:42.692 --> 00:44.170
- What do you... how do you interpret it?
- I feel like it represents

00:44.194 --> 00:47.379
the human mind, and how sometimes
the human mind is crazy,

00:47.456 --> 00:50.532
and it looks like throw-up. But
sometimes it looks like a rainbow.

00:50.609 --> 00:53.277
- Now we will critique Paige's art...
- All right.

00:53.279 --> 00:54.961
Uh, named?

00:55.038 --> 00:56.722
- "Untitled Landscape."
- Frankie: Ooh.

00:56.799 --> 01:00.208
- Like an environmental thing, like this is Earth.
- Paige: Mm-hmm.

01:00.286 --> 01:03.395
- Oh, yes, that's what I meant to do.
- Frankie: And this is Mars.

01:03.472 --> 01:07.958
Wow. I have no idea how
we're gonna clean this up.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.720
Hey, Paige, do you think
we could sell these?

01:10.796 --> 01:12.571
Paige?

01:12.648 --> 01:13.648
Male voice: Bizaartvark.

02:06.318 --> 02:09.728
Principal Karen? Our teacher said
you needed to see us immediately?

02:09.730 --> 02:10.337
What is it?
Did we fail midterms?

02:10.414 --> 02:11.563
Do we have detention?

02:11.565 --> 02:13.165
No. It's way more
serious than that.

02:14.826 --> 02:17.961
I used a face-morphing app to
combine our three faces together!

02:21.166 --> 02:25.185
So, the parent-teacher
conference you scheduled...?

02:25.262 --> 02:27.855
Yeah, I wanted them
to see it, too!

02:27.931 --> 02:29.857
Well, we... we should
get back to class,

02:29.933 --> 02:30.749
we were in the middle
of learning

02:30.751 --> 02:32.008
the quadratic equation.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.843
(school bell rings)

02:33.921 --> 02:36.029
Or not learning it.

02:36.106 --> 02:38.590
The only equation you need
to know

02:38.592 --> 02:42.202
is Bizaardvark plus Karen
equals awesome!

02:42.279 --> 02:44.279
Memorize it, there's a test
on it tomorrow!

02:44.356 --> 02:46.689
Just kidding! Not kidding!
I'm just kidding!

02:46.767 --> 02:48.433
(phone camera clicks)

02:48.435 --> 02:50.360
Does it seem like
Principal Karen

02:50.437 --> 02:51.997
is a little too into
Bizaardvark lately?

02:52.530 --> 02:55.123
There my girls at!

02:55.200 --> 02:56.608
Guess who learned
to play the keytar!

02:56.610 --> 02:58.835
(plays funky tune)

03:00.781 --> 03:04.725
Karen on the keys!
Now I can be in all the vids!

03:04.801 --> 03:08.787
(plays funky tune)

03:08.789 --> 03:10.380
- Girl-ios!
- (both yelp)

03:10.457 --> 03:13.792
I came up with a couple ideas
for some hilars Biz vids!

03:13.794 --> 03:15.310
Oh.

03:15.387 --> 03:17.053
Okay, it's a couple hundred.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.091
Do you love 'em? Do you hate 'em?
Do you love 'em?

03:21.226 --> 03:22.817
We have to get her to back off.

03:22.894 --> 03:23.894
It's too much!

03:23.971 --> 03:25.078
I got this.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.918
Principal Karen,
we know you're a big fan,

03:30.994 --> 03:33.420
but it feels like you've been
really into Bizaardvark lately.

03:33.497 --> 03:37.090
For sho'! All day, ery day!

03:37.167 --> 03:39.909
Biz for life! (Laughs)

03:39.987 --> 03:41.595
Well, I tried.

03:41.672 --> 03:44.339
Look... sweetheart...

03:46.827 --> 03:49.436
Paige and I
love your enthusiasm,

03:49.513 --> 03:51.754
but... could you
take it down a notch?

03:51.832 --> 03:53.498
Bizaardvark is a Vuuugle thing,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.108
and we're at school.

03:55.185 --> 03:57.277
Say no more. I get it.

03:57.354 --> 03:59.446
- You do?
- Totes!

03:59.523 --> 04:01.597
Skoo is skoo.

04:01.675 --> 04:02.675
Coo?

04:05.028 --> 04:06.194
Did someone say "coo"?

04:06.271 --> 04:09.364
Bernie, please,
this doesn't involve you.

04:09.441 --> 04:11.032
Coo-coo, coo. Coo, coo-coo.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.377
Oh! You landed on my property.

04:22.454 --> 04:25.288
You owe me
seven million dollars.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.693
Would you accept
seven million hugs?

04:26.717 --> 04:28.800
I would not.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.646
You can borrow some money
from me.

04:32.723 --> 04:34.815
Dirk, you've been out
of the game for two hours.

04:34.891 --> 04:38.059
We've been lettin' you play
with potato chips.

04:38.136 --> 04:40.470
Salt and "win-egar"!

04:40.547 --> 04:44.816
Nice! I was gonna go,
"Sour cream and 'wonion'"!

04:47.221 --> 04:48.445
Idiots.

04:51.225 --> 04:54.817
And you're both bankrupt. I win!

04:54.895 --> 04:57.579
Update the board.

04:57.655 --> 05:03.084
183 game night wins in a row.

05:03.161 --> 05:04.919
'Cause I'm just better
than you guys.

05:04.996 --> 05:06.421
More like lucky. Pffft!

05:06.498 --> 05:07.663
Yeah! Pffft!

05:07.741 --> 05:11.092
Pffft! Hey, we're good at that!

05:11.169 --> 05:15.838
It's not luck! You two just
aren't smart enough to beat me.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.916
(both gasp)

05:17.918 --> 05:21.436
How dare you, madam!

05:21.513 --> 05:25.940
You guys could even play me
two on one and I'd still win.

05:26.017 --> 05:27.108
You can pick the game, too.

05:27.185 --> 05:29.928
(both laughing)

05:29.930 --> 05:32.264
Oh, it's on.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.824
Dirk? I think you know the game.

05:37.028 --> 05:38.045
Both: Gummyland!

05:40.457 --> 05:42.097
Child's voice: Gummyland!
It's for babies!

05:43.794 --> 05:47.612
All right, Amelia. It's time to
see how smart these two guys are.

05:47.614 --> 05:52.708
This game is an epic test of
brains, strategy, and stamina.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.227
The three "B's."

05:56.457 --> 05:57.457
Two of those were "S's."

06:03.297 --> 06:07.299
Hey, guys, thanks again for being a part of
our latest comedy video, "I Love Bunnies."

06:07.301 --> 06:09.058
All right, roll the camera,
let's rock!

06:09.136 --> 06:16.324
(death metal guitar playing) -♪ I
love the softness of their fur ♪

06:16.401 --> 06:19.978
♪ They're always hopping
in a field ♪

06:19.980 --> 06:21.329
♪ Carrot break! ♪

06:21.406 --> 06:27.243
- (death metal music continues)
- (cheering, whistling)

06:27.321 --> 06:29.579
Karen: Mosh pit!

06:29.656 --> 06:31.098
Woo!

06:32.826 --> 06:33.600
Woo! (Laughs)

06:33.677 --> 06:37.011
Ahh! That was so metal, right?

06:37.088 --> 06:38.497
Metal!

06:38.499 --> 06:40.107
Bunnies!

06:40.183 --> 06:41.558
- Yeah!
- (feedback)

06:43.837 --> 06:45.437
Principal Karen,
what are you doing here?

06:45.506 --> 06:48.764
You said Bizaardvark was a Vuuugle
thing, so I came to Vuuugle.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.401
Skoo is skoo. Vuug is vuug.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.514
This is bad.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.626
Also, turns out, Vuuugle is
just a quick 90-minute drive

06:59.703 --> 07:03.446
from my house, so I can
pop by literally anytime.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.449
Anytime! Anytime!

07:06.527 --> 07:07.801
- (shouts) Anytime!
- (gasps)

07:07.878 --> 07:08.878
Woo!

07:11.214 --> 07:13.381
What do we do?

07:13.458 --> 07:14.677
Principal Karen
is out of control,

07:14.701 --> 07:16.034
and she's never
gonna leave us alone.

07:16.036 --> 07:19.387
I wish we could understand
the mind of a superfan.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.595
I can think of one person
who can help us...

07:24.878 --> 07:26.038
but you're not gonna like it.

07:26.971 --> 07:28.304
You don't mean...

07:28.382 --> 07:31.566
Hi! It's me! Belissa,
Bizaardvark's biggest fan!

07:31.643 --> 07:32.901
(loud giggling)

07:32.977 --> 07:35.144
I framed you! And now
you're wanted criminals!

07:35.222 --> 07:37.405
(loud giggling)

07:38.909 --> 07:43.319
Belissa? No way! I am not
ready to see that girl again.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.914
I'm dancing with a horse guy!

07:45.990 --> 07:48.008
I'm gonna be
coming here all the time!

07:51.572 --> 07:52.572
Call Belissa.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.054
Hey, guys! Dirk here
with my boy Bernie,

07:58.078 --> 07:59.238
and today we are doing the...

08:01.248 --> 08:02.575
All we're gonna do
is eat some food,

08:02.599 --> 08:05.750
blow into each other's
faces, and the other person

08:05.752 --> 08:07.769
has to guess which food
we just ate.

08:07.845 --> 08:09.362
So like we do every day?

08:09.439 --> 08:10.755
Yeah! But now
the cameras are on!

08:10.757 --> 08:12.273
Here we blow!

08:12.350 --> 08:13.274
I think I'm gonna
be great at this.

08:13.351 --> 08:14.776
Like I think I'm gonna
destroy you.

08:14.852 --> 08:18.872
I think I have more knowledge
of overall foods than you do.

08:18.949 --> 08:22.434
- (exhales)
- Oh, gosh!

08:22.436 --> 08:23.952
- Zucchini!
- No! Blue cheese!

08:24.028 --> 08:25.620
Ohh!

08:25.697 --> 08:28.698
Okay, let's... get rid of that.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.335
All right, my turn now.
Close your eyes.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.778
- Oh man.
- Okay. (Exhales)

08:33.780 --> 08:34.721
- Never mind.
- A strawberry.

08:34.798 --> 08:36.223
No. It's a banana.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.007
(fog horn sounds)

08:39.453 --> 08:42.378
Ooh! Sounds nasty.

08:42.456 --> 08:43.471
(exhales)

08:43.548 --> 08:46.066
Ohh! What is that?

08:46.142 --> 08:47.626
- Salami. (Yelps)
- (buzzer sound)

08:47.628 --> 08:49.385
Brussels sprouts!

08:49.463 --> 08:50.795
Dirk: Dreading this.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.147
Bernie: Oh! Oh, no.

08:53.224 --> 08:54.983
Hurry up, Bernie,
I'm getting nervous.

08:55.059 --> 08:57.485
- (exhales)
- Oh, sardines.

08:57.562 --> 08:58.762
No, it's a tuna fish sandwich.

09:02.233 --> 09:03.416
- (exhales)
- Peppermint.

09:03.493 --> 09:05.418
Oh-ho! Winner!

09:05.495 --> 09:06.661
(slowed) Yes!

09:11.151 --> 09:15.411
Wow. Still can't believe
Belissa's in military school.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.913
How long has she been here?

09:17.991 --> 09:20.416
In military school we don't track
time by the number of days.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.594
We track it by the number
of scars you have.

09:24.498 --> 09:26.264
Who hurt you?

09:28.593 --> 09:31.111
(beeps) - Remember, we
need Belissa's help.

09:31.187 --> 09:33.563
Just stay strong
and brace for the crazy.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.691
- Hey, Belissa!
- Hi!

09:36.768 --> 09:39.602
Hello, Paige. Hello, Frankie.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
Please, have a seat.

09:43.867 --> 09:48.962
Wow, Belissa. There's something...
different about you.

09:49.039 --> 09:52.281
Is it my hair? Or the fact that I
no longer show obsessive tendencies

09:52.359 --> 09:54.839
since my parents sent me to
military school for kidnapping you.

09:57.288 --> 09:59.797
You know what? Both, actually.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.960
Belissa, we came
because we need your help

10:05.038 --> 10:07.814
to get rid
of a new Bizaardvark superfan.

10:07.891 --> 10:09.519
- Superfan?
- Her name is Principal Karen.

10:09.543 --> 10:10.984
She's out of control.

10:11.061 --> 10:13.636
She crashed our video shoot.
She's always pitching ideas.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.156
- She even learned to play the...
- The keytar?

10:16.232 --> 10:17.982
- How'd you know?
- Textbook superfan.

10:20.478 --> 10:21.864
It's only a matter of time
until she tries

10:21.888 --> 10:23.288
to swab your cheeks
while you sleep,

10:23.314 --> 10:25.907
so she could use the cells
to grow her own Bizaardvark.

10:25.983 --> 10:27.500
What? Belissa, did you...

10:27.577 --> 10:30.995
No, no, no. The technology
never caught up with my idea.

10:32.990 --> 10:35.842
Oh, thank goodness.

10:35.919 --> 10:40.180
Anyway, um, wh... what
do we do about Principal Karen?

10:40.256 --> 10:42.385
The only way to get rid of a superfan
is to make them realize they're hurting

10:42.409 --> 10:44.909
the one thing they love most.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.411
Tell Principal Karen
she's bad for Bizaardvark.

10:46.413 --> 10:50.431
Perfect! Thanks, Belissa.

10:50.508 --> 10:52.395
Come on, let's go
before she does the cheek thing.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.586
Wait!
Before you go, may I have a hug?

10:54.588 --> 10:56.437
For old time's sake.

10:56.514 --> 10:57.514
Frankie: Oh!

11:00.594 --> 11:01.829
Are you sure you don't
wanna stay for dinner?

11:01.853 --> 11:02.853
We're having push-ups!

11:04.689 --> 11:08.950
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

11:14.608 --> 11:16.666
Your move... boys!

11:20.371 --> 11:21.504
Okay, we rolled a two.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.633
I agree.

11:25.710 --> 11:29.229
The objective of the game is to get
to the top of Gummyland Mountain.

11:29.305 --> 11:30.897
So maybe
we should move our piece

11:30.974 --> 11:33.400
two spaces closer
to Gummyland Mountain.

11:33.476 --> 11:37.070
Or... we could steal her piece
so she can't win.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.132
You can't steal my piece.

11:42.393 --> 11:44.969
We're gonna pass.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.079
Fine. My turn.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.492
Ooh, a six. (Chuckles)

11:55.148 --> 12:00.835
Oh, my. I'm gettin' real close
to Gummyland Mountain now.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.990
Okay, we're lookin'
pretty dumb here.

12:05.992 --> 12:09.602
How about you roll a six so we can
get closer to Gummyland Mountain.

12:09.679 --> 12:10.679
I'm on it.

12:12.423 --> 12:14.015
- That's a five!
- I know it's a five!

12:18.262 --> 12:19.929
Great. Now we're at
a fork in the road.

12:20.006 --> 12:23.508
Obviously we should go left
towards the Caramel Lagoon.

12:23.510 --> 12:27.269
The Caramel Lagoon? Obviously, we should
go right, through the Cotton Candy Forest!

12:27.347 --> 12:28.771
The Cotton Candy Forest?

12:28.849 --> 12:31.607
Do you have a death wish?

12:31.685 --> 12:34.109
Where do you think
the Cotton Candy Crows live?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.111
Hey! You know the
ecosystem of Gummyland

12:36.189 --> 12:38.965
is constantly changing!

12:39.042 --> 12:43.118
Do not talk down to me! -(Thinks)
Ugh, this is takin' forever.

12:43.196 --> 12:47.623
Oh, no. I've never been alone
with my thoughts before.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.217
What do I think about?

12:49.293 --> 12:52.812
I'm pretty. (Gasp) My
thoughts can see my face!

12:57.468 --> 13:00.803
- (buzzing sound)
- Aaah! Oww! Ohh!

13:00.881 --> 13:02.396
Are you getting a tattoo?

13:02.473 --> 13:03.973
Yes, and it hurts.

13:04.050 --> 13:08.161
The cloth is so cold, and Rafe
is pressing it on so hard!

13:11.482 --> 13:13.882
Also, Mr. Higgins, what did I
tell you about shaving in here?

13:17.413 --> 13:19.580
So? What do you think?

13:19.657 --> 13:20.657
Toit, right?

13:22.068 --> 13:25.419
Um... it's...

13:25.496 --> 13:26.796
You're 35!

13:29.242 --> 13:33.578
Principal Karen, we love that you're a
huge Bizaardvark fan, but, the truth is,

13:33.580 --> 13:38.191
you being so into Bizaardvark is kind of
preventing us from being Bizaardvark,

13:38.268 --> 13:40.175
and that's bad for Bizaardvark.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.195
Oh.

13:42.272 --> 13:46.533
Thank you for telling me. I'd never
wanna do anything to harm Bizaardvark.

13:46.609 --> 13:48.369
I'll go track down Rafe
and get this removed.

13:50.764 --> 13:53.373
Wow. She took that really well.

13:53.449 --> 13:54.760
I can't believe
Belissa was right.

13:54.784 --> 13:56.709
Hey, celebratory keytar solo?

13:56.786 --> 13:57.994
We got time.

13:59.697 --> 14:02.531
(playing keytar)

14:02.609 --> 14:04.000
(both laughing)

14:05.703 --> 14:08.054
- (phone ringing)
- Hello?

14:08.131 --> 14:09.630
May I speak to Paige
and Frankie?

14:09.707 --> 14:11.132
This is Paige and Frankie.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.888
Oh, thank goodness
you're both still alive.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.286
- Both: What?
- Nothing!

14:15.288 --> 14:17.897
Uhh, nothing.

14:17.974 --> 14:19.899
It's okay, guys. They're good!

14:19.976 --> 14:21.142
(people cheer)

14:22.812 --> 14:25.071
Wait, who is this?

14:25.148 --> 14:27.367
(on phone) Sgt. Brenner from
East Point Military Academy.

14:27.391 --> 14:30.243
Your friend Belissa
escaped last night.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.987
She used a hairpin
to unlock the school gate.

14:33.064 --> 14:35.230
Oh, no. That's my hairpin.
She must've taken it

14:35.308 --> 14:37.417
when she hugged me!

14:37.493 --> 14:40.903
On an unrelated note, do you
happen to know a Principal Karen?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.422
Yeah, why?

14:42.498 --> 14:45.425
We think Belissa might've
broken out to find her.

14:45.501 --> 14:46.985
Why do you think that?

14:46.987 --> 14:50.087
We have personnel trained
in the art of rogue behavior.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.100
Also, she wrote it
all over the wall.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.512
Anyway, have a magical day.

15:00.350 --> 15:06.446
Oh, no. Belissa must've snapped when
she learned we had a new superfan!

15:06.522 --> 15:09.932
You don't think she'd actually try to find
Principal Karen and hurt her, do you?

15:10.010 --> 15:11.670
(calmly) I don't know, Paige.
That was the first thing

15:11.694 --> 15:14.862
that popped into your mind, so I'm
gonna go with... (loudly) yes!

15:14.939 --> 15:17.624
Brenner:
I'm gonna go with yes, too.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.368
You never hung up.

15:20.444 --> 15:21.831
I assumed it was
permission to listen.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.579
Again, have a magical day.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.836
Hey, guys! Paige and Frankie
here to do...

15:32.957 --> 15:34.957
With Amelia as our model.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.976
We are going to design Amelia
an outfit

15:37.053 --> 15:38.886
using these household items.

15:38.963 --> 15:40.295
I'm so excited!

15:40.373 --> 15:42.482
We're makin' clothes
out of junk!

15:42.558 --> 15:44.317
(rock music plays)

15:44.394 --> 15:46.301
Ooh! So...

15:46.379 --> 15:47.728
I don't know how
to make a shirt.

15:47.805 --> 15:48.546
I was thinking we'll
make a top with this.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.140
Here, let's do... yeah.

15:51.217 --> 15:52.566
Wrap me
like a Christmas present.

15:52.643 --> 15:54.621
What... what about her arms?
Where are they gonna go?

15:54.645 --> 15:57.830
- Uh, yeah, that's true, okay. Like that?
- All right.

15:57.907 --> 15:59.499
- Woo!
- The base of it is done.

15:59.575 --> 16:00.794
- (camera clicks)
- How do you feel, Amelia?

16:00.818 --> 16:03.336
Um, I think it could be
taken in a little bit.

16:03.413 --> 16:04.413
Taken in?

16:07.233 --> 16:08.513
All right,
let's add some fringe.

16:10.086 --> 16:11.252
(camera clicks)

16:11.328 --> 16:13.012
Okay. Okay. Okay.

16:13.089 --> 16:14.566
I see where you're goin'
with this. Yup.

16:14.590 --> 16:16.068
- I gotta do them with three with the blue.
- The blue?

16:16.092 --> 16:18.667
- Yeah.
- We should do it so that, we, like, we hide the...

16:18.745 --> 16:20.094
Look how good that is.

16:20.171 --> 16:21.240
Okay, do it all
with orange ones.

16:21.264 --> 16:23.690
(gasp) What if we...
- What?

16:23.766 --> 16:27.101
- Do a little hat accessory?
- Okay.

16:27.178 --> 16:28.378
Would you wear this every day?

16:28.438 --> 16:29.489
I would totally
wear this every day.

16:29.513 --> 16:32.106
- And... done.
- Voila!

16:32.183 --> 16:33.441
We've done it.

16:33.517 --> 16:34.867
I think you look gorgeous.

16:34.944 --> 16:36.536
- I feel gorgeous.
- Looks good.

16:36.612 --> 16:41.766
Next up we have Amelia Duckworth
wearing a Paige and Frankie creation

16:41.768 --> 16:45.786
- Ooh, she looks stunning.
- Oh yes, it falls apart on the runway.

16:45.863 --> 16:49.882
- What an art. Beauty. Yes.
- Iconic.

16:49.959 --> 16:51.167
Amelia: We done did it.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.840
(all laughing)

17:01.045 --> 17:04.230
We need to get Principal Karen to a safe
place where Belissa can't find her.

17:04.307 --> 17:05.307
Both: Like our studio.

17:05.382 --> 17:06.232
Oh. Had the same idea.

17:06.309 --> 17:08.292
Paige, it's not a competition.

17:08.294 --> 17:12.554
Oh, uh, Principal Karen,
uh, we need you to come with us.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.967
Uh, Ashley, could you please tell these
girls that I'm not speaking to them anymore

17:15.969 --> 17:18.636
because apparently,
I'm bad for Bizaardvark.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.040
Wait, seriously?
You're not talking to us?

17:20.064 --> 17:21.822
You... you said
you were fine with it.

17:21.899 --> 17:26.160
Well, I'm not. And to think I was
gonna swab the inside of your cheeks

17:26.237 --> 17:27.317
to grow my own Bizaardvark.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.749
What's with the cheeks, man?

17:34.154 --> 17:37.913
Belissa: Is this Sierra High?
(loud giggling)

17:37.991 --> 17:39.135
- Both: Belissa!
- She's in the building.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.636
We need to get
Principal Karen to our studio.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.326
Shouldn't we stop Belissa?

17:42.328 --> 17:46.773
I don't know, Paige. She just muscled
her way past 10 security guards

17:46.849 --> 17:50.592
at a military school,
so I'm gonna go with, no!

17:50.670 --> 17:54.947
Okay, I'll get Principal Karen to come with us,
but we're gonna talk about your tone later.

17:57.268 --> 18:01.679
Well, Principal Karen, we were gonna
invite you for a private tour

18:01.681 --> 18:06.867
of Bizaardvark's studio,
but since you're mad at us,

18:06.944 --> 18:07.776
we'll just go.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.203
- Private?
- (both gasp)

18:11.691 --> 18:13.966
As in just me and no one else?

18:14.043 --> 18:14.859
I might be able to forgive you.

18:14.861 --> 18:15.951
Great.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.212
(Belissa, singsongy) Karen!

18:18.289 --> 18:21.699
- What was that?
- Um... uh, just someone yelling your name.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.384
You're very cool.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.386
Can I tell you a secret?
I've been working on it!

18:31.894 --> 18:32.894
What the...?

18:35.048 --> 18:36.375
We couldn't figure out
what move to make,

18:36.399 --> 18:40.551
so we built a replica
of Gummyland, so Ding Dong here,

18:40.553 --> 18:44.497
could see that going left
makes zero sense.

18:44.574 --> 18:46.282
It's been a day and a half.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.244
Zero sense? Zero sense?

18:50.321 --> 18:54.582
Who would choose Cotton Candy
Forest over the Caramel Lake?

18:54.658 --> 18:56.843
- It's a lagoon!
- You're a lagoon!

18:59.330 --> 19:02.923
(both grunting)

19:03.000 --> 19:05.017
(thinking)
Ugh, they even fight stupid.

19:05.094 --> 19:08.429
(grunts) I'm upset
at this situation!

19:08.505 --> 19:10.189
I am also very upset
at this situation!

19:15.104 --> 19:16.696
Ah!

19:16.772 --> 19:20.274
(thinking) I can't let two best
friends break up over a game.

19:20.351 --> 19:23.703
- (both grunt)
- Dirk: Hey!

19:23.779 --> 19:25.596
(thinking) So what if they
think they're smarter than me

19:25.598 --> 19:28.207
for one day?
I have to let them win.

19:28.284 --> 19:29.617
(boys grunting)

19:29.693 --> 19:31.118
(gasps) I'm nice!

19:36.459 --> 19:39.701
- (grunting continues)
- (gasps) Wow! You guys

19:39.779 --> 19:43.714
have a shortcut card to the
top of Gummyland Mountain!

19:49.046 --> 19:51.472
She's right! We're gonna win!

19:51.548 --> 19:53.900
- Or...
- For the love of...

19:53.976 --> 19:56.551
This is a trap!
Quick! Steal her piece!

19:56.629 --> 19:58.312
You can't win without this!

19:58.389 --> 19:59.829
And I know you're not
goin' in there!

20:02.468 --> 20:04.026
Looks like we won!

20:06.063 --> 20:10.141
(thinking) All right, I
am done playin' nice.

20:10.143 --> 20:11.787
These dummies think
I'm not goin' in there?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.327
I'm goin' in there!

20:26.175 --> 20:27.383
One.

20:29.011 --> 20:31.262
I win... again!

20:41.507 --> 20:42.940
That was hot!

20:47.029 --> 20:49.789
Love the stude!

20:49.865 --> 20:53.275
You guys are livin'
like a boss up in here!

20:53.353 --> 20:57.246
I am so glad we made up. That
was the worst hour of my life.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.192
Belissa:
Where's Bizaardvark's studio?

21:01.194 --> 21:03.618
(emphatically) Where is it?

21:03.696 --> 21:07.198
Wait, did you double book this tour?
Because I was promised

21:07.200 --> 21:09.383
totes excluse
and that's not totes excluse.

21:09.460 --> 21:13.470
No, no, it's totes excluse,
it's totes, totes excluse.

21:15.132 --> 21:16.132
(mutters) Kill me.

21:18.060 --> 21:20.135
Belissa: I know Principal
Karen's in there!

21:20.213 --> 21:22.137
(pounds on door) Let me at her!

21:22.215 --> 21:23.638
She knows my name?

21:23.716 --> 21:26.217
Okay, what's going on here?

21:26.219 --> 21:30.237
All right, listen... our former
superfan broke out of military school

21:30.314 --> 21:33.982
because she feels threatened by
you, and now she wants to hurt you.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.318
Hurt me? She sounds like a kid.
How could she hurt me?

21:36.396 --> 21:38.671
(all three scream)

21:38.748 --> 21:40.398
Belissa: Thanks for
the axe, Dare Me Bro!

21:40.400 --> 21:41.480
Dirk: You can keep it, bro.

21:43.327 --> 21:44.826
Belissa, you don't
have to do this.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.828
- (axe hits door)
- (Principal Karen screams)

21:46.906 --> 21:49.131
I just want to talk to her.

21:50.667 --> 21:55.429
If I don't make it, give Vice
Principal Milton this note.

21:55.506 --> 21:57.097
"Do you like me?
Yes, no, maybe."

21:57.174 --> 21:59.083
Come on, Karen.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.085
(Frankie screams)

22:03.089 --> 22:04.157
Belissa, you don't need
to do this!

22:04.181 --> 22:06.699
I do!

22:06.776 --> 22:09.443
I'm not leaving until I
get my arms around her.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.538
Take Frankie first,
Paige is the funny one.

22:12.615 --> 22:13.522
- What?
- Frankie, it's not a competition,

22:13.599 --> 22:14.599
but thank you.

22:15.785 --> 22:20.621
Step aside, Bizaardvark. This
is between me and Karen.

22:20.697 --> 22:23.274
No, we are not gonna
let you hurt her.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.709
Hurt her? I'm not gonna hurt her.
I'm gonna hug her!

22:26.870 --> 22:28.629
(squeals)

22:28.705 --> 22:32.207
When I heard there was a superfan who
loves Bizaardvark as much as I do,

22:32.285 --> 22:35.453
I just had to meet her!

22:35.455 --> 22:37.357
Wait, you can't be as big
of a fan of theirs as I am.

22:37.381 --> 22:39.957
Oh, yeah? I'm trying to break
up my parents so my mom

22:39.959 --> 22:42.893
can marry Frankie's dad,
and we'll be stepsisters!

22:45.131 --> 22:46.131
Baller move!

22:47.967 --> 22:49.316
Wait, what?

22:49.393 --> 22:51.469
(gasp) Text me your digies.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.486
I'm gonna call your rents

22:52.563 --> 22:53.637
and tell them to get you

22:53.639 --> 22:54.413
out of that yucky
military school

22:54.490 --> 22:57.324
and enroll you at Sierra High!

22:57.401 --> 22:59.034
Both: Wait, what?

23:01.514 --> 23:04.315
Belissa and Karen:
This is our life now!

23:04.317 --> 23:05.649
(both speak sadly)
This is our life now.

23:05.651 --> 23:13.014
(Belissa and Karen giggle)
