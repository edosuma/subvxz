       [dark, moody music]      

03:06.019 --> 03:08.187
     [bags clatter heavily]     

03:55.869 --> 03:57.536
        Come on, you f...       

04:02.076 --> 04:03.809
       Alright. Wait here.      

04:10.250 --> 04:12.251
   So we're doing this thing.   

04:35.709 --> 04:38.010
         [camera whirrs]        

05:21.388 --> 05:22.954
          Hey, Freddie.         

05:22.989 --> 05:24.890
        [horse whickers]        

06:05.532 --> 06:08.266
   Terry. What are you doing?   

06:08.301 --> 06:09.801
              What?             

06:11.137 --> 06:12.704
     What did we talk about?    

06:13.874 --> 06:15.807
     What kind of criminals     
           get caught?          

06:17.111 --> 06:18.610
         The dumb ones.         

06:20.180 --> 06:22.513
      No fuck-ups. Alright?     

06:22.549 --> 06:25.317
  I'm not spending the rest of  
    my life in a concrete box   

06:25.352 --> 06:28.053
         simply because         
  you couldn't stick to a plan. 

06:28.122 --> 06:29.688
           Understood?          

06:30.556 --> 06:32.891
    Now, let's get this done.   

06:40.133 --> 06:45.070
  But know this. Once you step  
     inside here, you're in.    

06:45.138 --> 06:47.405
   No more of this pussy shit.  

06:47.407 --> 06:49.407
        Mate, we do this        
       together, alright?       

06:49.409 --> 06:51.242
        The way Dad would       
          have wanted.          

06:51.311 --> 06:54.012
       And what we start,       
       we're gonna finish.      

07:00.754 --> 07:01.753
               OK.              

07:01.821 --> 07:03.655
        Now, I know we're       
     wearing gloves, but try    

07:03.690 --> 07:05.690
      not to touch anything     
       you don't have to.       

07:06.926 --> 07:08.059
       Can I take a seat?       

07:09.829 --> 07:11.763
          You're clean.         
          You can sit.          

07:14.401 --> 07:15.767
               OK.              

07:21.175 --> 07:23.441
         Alright. So...         

07:23.443 --> 07:25.543
         Rodger will be         
         here about 5:30        

07:25.579 --> 07:28.213
      tonight to brush and      
         reshoe Freddie.        

07:28.248 --> 07:29.847
 The buyer will turn up at 7:00.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.950
   I've mapped everything out   
        so we'll be ready       

07:31.952 --> 07:34.619
  about half an hour to an hour 
     before Rodger turns up.    

07:35.589 --> 07:38.290
     Wh... why is this buyer    
        coming at 7pm to        

07:38.358 --> 07:40.624
       try and put Freddie      
       into a horse float?      

07:40.693 --> 07:42.760
       What kind of idiot       
   loads a horse in the dark?   

07:42.795 --> 07:45.130
   I... I reckon Freddie will   
     get spooked, don't you?    

07:45.132 --> 07:45.963
        Not our concern.        

07:46.800 --> 07:48.767
     Rodger organised it and    
     he's with Mum all day.     

07:48.802 --> 07:51.102
     Besides, mate, it works    
 beautifully with our schedule. 

07:51.137 --> 07:53.138
      The chances of anyone     
    seeing us leave at night    

07:53.140 --> 07:56.408
is the same as when we came here
this morning - minimal at best. 

07:56.910 --> 07:59.944
      Now, you'll see that      
       I've set the alarm       

07:59.980 --> 08:03.281
     for final idiot checks     
        and exit - 6:15.        

08:03.317 --> 08:05.149
        You know, I still       
        don't understand        

08:05.218 --> 08:07.085
       why we're here for       
         the whole day.         

08:07.988 --> 08:09.453
        Because there's a       
         lot to prepare.        

08:10.156 --> 08:12.657
 And we're only gonna have half 
  an hour or so to deal with... 

08:13.260 --> 08:14.726
      to deal with Rodger.      

08:14.761 --> 08:15.994
         And what's with        
        all the cleaning?       

08:15.996 --> 08:17.795
        You've got, like,       
      seven cleans in here.     

08:17.831 --> 08:18.729
           [Jeff] Six.          

08:18.765 --> 08:20.564
      Mate, human emotions      
      being what they are,      

08:20.600 --> 08:22.667
    if we leave the cleaning    
      till after the fact,      

08:22.669 --> 08:24.569
 we're likely to miss something.

08:24.604 --> 08:25.836
      I think you're gonna      
          be surprised,         

08:25.905 --> 08:27.572
       Terry, how quickly       
       the day's gonna go.      

08:27.608 --> 08:29.674
    - There's a lot to cover.   
      - Oh, I can see that.     

08:30.077 --> 08:33.678
And a lot of this stuff, I don't
  remember us ever discussing.  

08:33.679 --> 08:36.480
       These other things       
        you've got - "ice       

08:36.515 --> 08:39.683
       junkie rehearsal",       
       "electrocution"...       

08:40.153 --> 08:41.485
              Tez.              

08:41.520 --> 08:43.522
       Terry, look at me.       

08:44.491 --> 08:46.324
    As Dad would always say,    

08:46.359 --> 08:50.294
       failing to plan is       
        planning to fail.       

08:50.330 --> 08:51.863
       I know that, Jeff.       

08:51.865 --> 08:53.798
       It's just a little       
         intense seeing         

08:53.834 --> 08:55.634
         it all written         
         down like this.        

08:55.669 --> 08:57.802
         You've done it         
       like a to-do list.       

08:57.838 --> 09:00.705
       It is a to-do list.      
   That's exactly what it is.   

09:00.774 --> 09:02.373
     You know what? Just...     
        just forget this.       

09:02.442 --> 09:03.942
           Let's just           
      keep moving, can we?      

09:03.977 --> 09:08.446
          Alright. OK.          
   Let's synchronise watches.   

09:08.481 --> 09:10.381
           Seriously?           

09:10.450 --> 09:12.283
I'm very serious. No short cuts.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.885
Yeah, but couldn't you have just
 said, "What time do you have?" 

09:14.954 --> 09:16.721
    instead of, "Synchronise    
      our fucking watches"?     

09:17.524 --> 09:19.023
 Alright, what time do you have?

09:19.058 --> 09:19.858
            I don't.            

09:20.727 --> 09:22.994
       Because, like most       
      normal human beings,      

09:23.029 --> 09:25.696
        I use my phone to       
        tell me the time.       

09:25.731 --> 09:28.233
      But you've taken that     
       from me, remember?       

10:06.706 --> 10:09.074
       [metal box clunks]       

11:01.661 --> 11:03.160
            Find it?            

11:03.162 --> 11:04.663
              Yeah.             

11:05.598 --> 11:07.098
        We'll have to put       
       it back afterwards,      

11:07.133 --> 11:08.933
       so I'll make a note      
         in the agenda.         

11:11.405 --> 11:12.671
          Doesn't work.         

11:13.339 --> 11:15.006
     Wind it. Give it a tap.    

11:16.109 --> 11:18.642
         Dad used to say        
  it had a heart for a battery. 

11:18.678 --> 11:20.812
         Give it enough         
     attention, it'll work.     

11:25.452 --> 11:26.851
          [watch ticks]         

11:26.920 --> 11:28.019
              Huh!              

11:31.424 --> 11:33.024
          What's that?          

11:34.127 --> 11:35.126
           Toothache.           

11:36.195 --> 11:40.598
   Alright. Let's synchronise   
        watches for 7:14.       

11:40.633 --> 11:41.800
     It's time to ring Mum.     

11:42.802 --> 11:45.269
       [car horns honk, PA      
     announcements on tape]     

11:45.305 --> 11:46.771
             [dials]            

11:50.877 --> 11:53.878
         Hey. It's Jeff.        

11:53.880 --> 11:56.447
   Jeff, Mum. Your son. Jeff.   

11:56.483 --> 11:59.050
    [laughs] Yeah. Yes, yeah.   

11:59.119 --> 12:01.218
    - No, we've just arrived.   
   - [train station PA chimes]  

12:01.220 --> 12:03.888
    No, it's great. It's good   
  to spend some time together.  

12:03.890 --> 12:06.891
     Big city, Sydney. Very     
        loud, very noisy.       

12:06.893 --> 12:09.027
    [car horns honk on tape]    

12:09.696 --> 12:11.396
   Oh, no, he's off shopping.   

12:12.532 --> 12:13.965
       Of course he wants       
      to talk to you, Mum.      

12:14.000 --> 12:15.566
        He's out... he's        
       buying chocolate...      

12:15.568 --> 12:17.501
       chocolates for the       
       kids or something.       

12:17.536 --> 12:19.404
  No, no, Jeff. Not chocolate.  

12:19.406 --> 12:20.738
         Sorry, hang...         

12:20.740 --> 12:22.974
         Not chocolate.         
  The boys don't eat chocolate. 

12:23.009 --> 12:24.141
              What?             

12:24.177 --> 12:26.577
     - Sue doesn't allow it.    
      - You're shittin' me!     

12:26.579 --> 12:28.913
When Mum sent the boys chocolate
           at Easter,           

12:28.915 --> 12:31.749
    Sue spent a whole night,    
    and I begged her not to,    

12:31.751 --> 12:34.152
       but she wrote this       
        three-page essay        

12:34.187 --> 12:36.253
     on the negative impact     
      of chocolate on kids.     

12:36.322 --> 12:40.191
    Don't ask me what it is.    
   I don't get it. But Mum...   

12:40.227 --> 12:42.927
      Trust me, Mum knows.      
   They can't have chocolate.   

12:43.763 --> 12:46.263
         You there? Mum?        

12:46.332 --> 12:47.832
      No, you misheard me.      

12:47.867 --> 12:50.901
  No, no, no, he's buying them  
    for my... for... for me.    

12:50.936 --> 12:52.771
      H-h-how's your blood?     

12:53.907 --> 12:56.775
     Your blood levels, Mum.    
    The markers, are they up?   

12:57.777 --> 12:59.944
       OK, well, what did       
         the doctor say?        

13:00.613 --> 13:01.912
        Yeah, no, I kn...       

13:01.948 --> 13:03.448
       No... I hope you're      
         not calling him        

13:03.450 --> 13:04.715
        "Dr Vindaloo" to        
         his face, Mum.         

13:04.751 --> 13:05.450
     He's there to help you.    

13:06.520 --> 13:08.286
       Alright, and so...       
         and the chemo?         

13:09.121 --> 13:10.555
     That's happening today?    

13:11.857 --> 13:14.392
  A-a-and wh-what about Rodger? 

13:15.428 --> 13:17.795
      Well, is he... is he      
      staying back with you     

13:17.797 --> 13:20.799
    or is he still seeing...    
     the guy about Freddie?     

13:21.300 --> 13:23.267
       Freddie the horse.       

13:23.302 --> 13:24.969
         The horse, Mum!        

13:27.740 --> 13:29.473
    Right. Right. Well, good.   

13:29.475 --> 13:30.875
    So, happy thoughts, hey?    

13:31.711 --> 13:34.479
         For the chemo.         
       Positive thinking.       

13:34.981 --> 13:35.980
              Yes.              

13:36.649 --> 13:38.917
    Alright. I love you, Mum.   

13:40.287 --> 13:41.752
          Mum? I said--         

13:41.787 --> 13:44.255
    [car horns honk on tape]    

13:44.824 --> 13:46.224
     Yeah, man. We're good.     

13:46.993 --> 13:49.961
 Rodger's gonna be here at 5:30.

13:51.263 --> 13:52.330
     You're sure sat phones     
        can't be traced?        

13:53.933 --> 13:56.434
 Yes, mate. It's half the reason
      why people buy them.      

13:57.837 --> 13:59.837
        Are you confident       
  our phones made it to Sydney? 

14:00.773 --> 14:03.140
  The courier company will send 
   the package back on Monday   

14:03.175 --> 14:04.842
        and the GPS will        
      show that our phones      

14:04.844 --> 14:06.443
         had a glorious         
       weekend in Sydney.       

14:06.479 --> 14:07.678
           We're good.          

14:07.680 --> 14:09.113
            Alright.            

14:30.637 --> 14:32.169
         [Terry] What is        
       there to rehearse?       

14:32.204 --> 14:33.871
       Rodger goes in the       
         bath, appliance        

14:33.940 --> 14:35.540
        goes in the bath,       
          end of story.         

14:35.608 --> 14:37.542
  When do we put the water in?  

14:37.610 --> 14:39.543
    Well, before, obviously.    

14:39.612 --> 14:40.979
         OK, me or you?         

14:41.347 --> 14:42.380
             Either.            

14:43.616 --> 14:45.149
    Now or closer to the act?   

14:45.785 --> 14:47.150
     I don't know. Whenever.    

14:47.186 --> 14:49.353
  And what appliance do we use? 

14:49.389 --> 14:50.687
           Hair dryer.          

14:50.723 --> 14:52.023
        She doesn't have        
          a hair dryer          

14:52.058 --> 14:53.557
      anymore. She smashed      
          it, remember?         

14:53.626 --> 14:55.826
    She's got no fucking hair   
     on her head. The chemo!    

14:55.862 --> 14:57.228
     [sighs] Then a toaster.    

14:58.331 --> 15:00.231
        They use the oven       
       grill to do toast!       

15:00.233 --> 15:01.666
       Rodger thinks it's       
          crispier that         

15:01.701 --> 15:03.000
        way. Come on, you       
         know this shit.        

15:03.035 --> 15:05.236
       Well, obviously you      
        have the answer.        

15:09.142 --> 15:11.876
        He kills himself        
        with a Tasman X?        

15:11.911 --> 15:13.511
         Yeah. Why not?         

15:13.546 --> 15:15.880
   I don't know. It's got some  
   poetry about it, I suppose.  

15:15.916 --> 15:18.082
  Poetry? Mate, this is serious 
         fucking pathos.        

15:18.151 --> 15:20.551
     This is Rodger's first     
      and favourite radio.      

15:20.587 --> 15:22.386
Alright. Great. So, are we done?

15:22.421 --> 15:25.189
   No. Cord's not gonna reach   
  from the hallway to the bath. 

15:26.059 --> 15:27.392
   So grab an extension lead.   

15:28.094 --> 15:31.195
  No, no. Not those. That one.  

15:31.764 --> 15:33.097
     One of Dad's old ones?     

15:33.166 --> 15:36.100
       Mm-hm. More poetry.      

15:36.169 --> 15:38.035
        Oh, yeah, no, you       
      should write fucking      

15:38.071 --> 15:39.604
         Christmas cards        
          for Hallmark.         

15:44.076 --> 15:45.776
[Jeff] No, uh, don't touch that.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.045
     What, I can't make tea?    

15:48.080 --> 15:49.747
        We don't want to        
         touch anything         

15:49.782 --> 15:51.549
   we don't have to, remember?  
              Here.             

15:52.052 --> 15:53.618
          You got milk?         

15:55.955 --> 15:57.888
     Uh, leave it. Leave it!    

15:57.924 --> 15:59.623
 No, I've got... got gloves on. 

15:59.692 --> 16:00.891
           The power!           

16:00.927 --> 16:02.260
  But the fridge is already on. 

16:02.295 --> 16:04.228
          Mate, I'm no          
      electrician, but you      

16:04.264 --> 16:06.297
         open that door,        
       power surge, right?      

16:06.366 --> 16:08.099
        Which means spike       
       in the usage meter.      

16:08.568 --> 16:10.567
       Which means someone      
      was in an empty house     

16:10.603 --> 16:13.237
  before the deceased rocked up 
         to top himself.        

16:13.273 --> 16:14.973
            Leave it.           

16:33.959 --> 16:35.726
           [footsteps]          

16:35.761 --> 16:38.229
 You know you're not supposed to
      eat or drink in here.     

16:38.831 --> 16:40.665
    [swallows] Yeah, I know.    

16:42.802 --> 16:45.235
          [Jeff sighs]          

16:45.270 --> 16:47.138
   Do you have a single memory  

16:47.173 --> 16:48.973
       of Mum ever opening      
       or taking anything       

16:49.008 --> 16:50.775
       out of that fucking      
        crystal cabinet?        

16:52.278 --> 16:54.345
       I still get anxious      
       just being near it.      

16:55.848 --> 16:57.314
             [sighs]            

16:57.350 --> 17:01.352
    And the last time I got a   
  hiding... was in that chair.  

17:03.022 --> 17:04.488
             Really?            

17:04.522 --> 17:05.356
              Yeah.             

17:06.192 --> 17:07.525
      It was at Dad's wake.     

17:08.528 --> 17:10.294
      Cousins and strangers     
           everywhere.          

17:11.030 --> 17:13.031
 Drinkin', eatin', bullshittin'.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.366
 All I wanted was a quiet place 

17:15.367 --> 17:17.867
     to come and eat some of    
Aunty Shirl's ginger fluff cake.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.871
      I don't know how Mum      
        knew or where she       

17:19.873 --> 17:23.141
        came from, but...       
         two bites in...        

17:24.309 --> 17:25.710
  flew in like a fuckin' ninja. 

17:26.712 --> 17:29.213
     She had some kind of...    
            tripwire            

17:29.315 --> 17:31.048
         or something in        
        here, I swear it.       

17:31.050 --> 17:32.716
        [chuckles] Yeah.        

17:32.785 --> 17:34.818
 I didn't get to the third bite.

17:34.854 --> 17:35.720
             Wallop.            

17:36.623 --> 17:38.056
   Mum hit you at Dad's wake?   

17:38.691 --> 17:40.725
    Oh, yeah. A real stinger.   

17:42.194 --> 17:43.728
       I never knew that.       

17:44.864 --> 17:46.397
       Never told anyone.       

17:53.072 --> 17:55.540
         I had my first         
       kiss in this room.       

17:56.009 --> 17:57.541
         Chrissie Holt.         

17:57.576 --> 17:58.842
           [chuckles]           

17:58.877 --> 18:00.745
     Man, I was so nervous.     

18:02.414 --> 18:05.683
   I practised kissing on the   
   bathroom tiles for a week.   

18:08.754 --> 18:10.421
    I fuckin' hate this room.   

18:15.761 --> 18:16.861
            [groans]            

18:17.763 --> 18:19.063
     I'm gonna take a piss.     

18:19.699 --> 18:22.266
      Well, hang on, you...     
  you can't piss in the toilet. 

18:23.703 --> 18:24.669
           I'm sorry?           

18:26.339 --> 18:27.839
   You're fuckin' kidding me!   

18:28.941 --> 18:31.275
   - Tez, it's a septic tank.   
           - So what?           

18:31.344 --> 18:33.110
            - Water.            
        - What about it?        

18:33.179 --> 18:35.346
   The power, when you flush.   
             Surge.             

18:36.849 --> 18:39.883
Where's the power come from? You
 don't have power in a toilet!  

18:39.918 --> 18:42.286
           - The pump!          
             - Ohh!             

18:42.355 --> 18:45.055
   No, and... and you'll leave  
      residue on the bowl.      

18:45.090 --> 18:46.257
    - What does that matter?    
             - DNA.             

18:47.393 --> 18:49.126
      Yeah, but, J, we grew     
        up in this house.       

18:49.195 --> 18:51.195
      This place is riddled     
          with our DNA.         

18:51.231 --> 18:54.465
 Yeah, but... old DNA, not new. 
      There's a difference.     

18:54.934 --> 18:55.566
              What?             

18:56.636 --> 18:58.302
       So, what if I want       
         to take a shit?        

18:59.205 --> 19:01.205
        Well, unless you        
       want to poo in your      

19:01.240 --> 19:03.273
        hands and... put        
       it in your pocket,       

19:03.309 --> 19:05.276
       I suggest you hang       
       on like a big boy.       

19:07.246 --> 19:11.582
      You know, the agenda,     
  the rules, the piss bottle... 

19:11.617 --> 19:13.216
     I mean, you're starting    
         to scare me, J.        

19:13.252 --> 19:14.551
      It's like you've done     
        all this before.        

19:14.586 --> 19:16.620
      Tez, just because I'm     
       not walking around       

19:16.656 --> 19:18.589
        shivering like a        
     little frightened lamb     

19:18.624 --> 19:20.491
      doesn't mean this is      
       any easier for me.       

19:20.493 --> 19:22.927
       I mean, Jesus, the       
  worst I've ever done is a...  

19:22.962 --> 19:24.295
        dodgy tax return!       

19:24.330 --> 19:26.663
         I'm just being         
     methodical, that's all.    

19:27.333 --> 19:30.233
    It's how my brain works.    
  You'll thank me for it later. 

19:30.269 --> 19:31.836
It's how I built my business up.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.306
       What, the business       
       you sent bankrupt?       

19:36.342 --> 19:39.143
     Seriously? You're gonna    
      make today emotional?     

19:39.645 --> 19:41.178
       We're about to kill      
       our stepfather for       

19:41.180 --> 19:42.613
         a block of land        
        and an old house.       

19:42.648 --> 19:44.281
        Things are gonna        
       get pretty fucking       

19:44.317 --> 19:45.682
      emotional, J, whether     
       you like it or not.      

19:45.684 --> 19:48.586
    Well, can you just focus    
       on the job at hand?      

19:48.621 --> 19:51.255
       And we'll both get       
       emotional tomorrow.      

19:51.290 --> 19:53.457
         "Job at hand"?         

19:53.492 --> 19:54.692
              Yes!              

19:55.160 --> 19:56.694
           Oh, look...          

19:58.097 --> 19:59.797
         Think of me...         

20:00.366 --> 20:01.432
       like your foreman.       

20:01.467 --> 20:02.966
    Right? You're a brickie.    

20:03.002 --> 20:05.636
You know, when you go on a site,
     you see the framework.     

20:05.672 --> 20:09.206
    Right? It's not your job    
 to worry about the end result. 

20:09.275 --> 20:11.108
 Right? It's about the process. 

20:11.144 --> 20:12.610
        And in your case,       
         it's about the         

20:12.645 --> 20:14.445
        bricks. You worry       
        about the bricks.       

20:14.480 --> 20:15.946
   One brick after the other.   

20:15.981 --> 20:17.214
      Brick, brick, brick,      
          brick, brick.         

20:17.283 --> 20:19.283
        Two, three hours        
          later, we can         

20:19.318 --> 20:21.552
        both stand back -       
       <i> voilà,</i> job done.        

20:21.554 --> 20:23.820
          - That easy?          
          - It can be.          

20:24.189 --> 20:26.958
  You do know I haven't been a  
  brickie for two years, yeah?  

20:28.561 --> 20:31.061
  No. I mean... Yeah. So what?  

20:31.063 --> 20:33.831
 Well, I know you knew, 'cause I
told you when I got the new job.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.400
        Do you know what        
        that new job is?        

20:37.303 --> 20:39.036
       Look, you're gonna       
        have to excuse me       

20:39.071 --> 20:40.805
       if I'm a bit rusty       
        on 20 questions.        

20:40.840 --> 20:41.906
   I've got a lot on my mind.   

20:43.009 --> 20:44.641
         Besides... you         
       probably don't even      

20:44.677 --> 20:47.011
         remember what I        
        do for a living.        

20:47.046 --> 20:48.579
       You're the head of       
        state operations        

20:48.647 --> 20:51.381
   for that new life insurance  
  company, Heartbeat Services.  

20:51.817 --> 20:53.584
     It's the blue building     
        on Chapel Street.       

20:53.652 --> 20:54.418
            Alright.            

20:54.887 --> 20:57.555
  And I know because Mum walks  
  the corridors of the hospital 

20:57.824 --> 21:00.258
 stopping anyone that'll listen 
   to her and raving about it.  

21:00.360 --> 21:02.259
   And if she's not banging on  
    about it, then Rodger is.   

21:02.328 --> 21:03.360
             Rodger?            
            Bullshit.           

21:03.395 --> 21:05.396
        It was his first        
         Facebook post!         

21:06.432 --> 21:08.666
          I'd show you,         
  but our phones are in Sydney. 

21:10.536 --> 21:13.537
   [Terry opens bathroom door]  

21:13.940 --> 21:16.707
           [urinates]           

21:21.280 --> 21:22.346
          Do you mind?!         

21:23.549 --> 21:26.250
  God! The next piss I'm gonna  
   take's gonna be on a tree.   

21:26.285 --> 21:27.718
 Did you bring the suicide note?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.621
 Can I just have a minute here?!
      [continues urinating]     

21:31.891 --> 21:34.725
     Jesus, Tez. I give you     
     one fuckin' job to do.     

21:34.760 --> 21:36.960
   You'd better get your head   
       in the game, mate.       

21:36.962 --> 21:39.964
  Can't have a suicide without  
  a suicide note, now, can we?  

21:40.032 --> 21:41.465
        Why not? Dad did.       

21:42.701 --> 21:45.036
      Just give it a shake      
   and get it done, will you?   

22:39.958 --> 22:42.860
       [unsettling music]       

23:12.891 --> 23:14.692
            [squish!]           

23:24.469 --> 23:26.002
     [Jeff sighs] Oh, Terry!    

23:26.038 --> 23:28.239
    13 words? That's all you    
       could come up with?      

23:28.307 --> 23:29.573
      What's wrong with it?     

23:29.575 --> 23:32.643
Mate, I wanted a suicide letter,
      not a suicide memo!       

23:32.678 --> 23:34.244
     No, I need more words!     

23:34.246 --> 23:35.412
  Why am I doing this, anyway?  

23:35.480 --> 23:37.247
     I thought we were gonna    
        write it together       

23:37.249 --> 23:38.749
       and post it online       
         straight after.        

23:38.751 --> 23:41.718
 No... No, no, neither of us are
  gonna be in any state of mind 

23:41.753 --> 23:44.654
   to write any kind of bloody  
     letter after the fact.     

23:44.690 --> 23:46.556
 No, no. You need to do it now. 

23:46.592 --> 23:47.758
          And then when         
         we're ready, we        

23:47.760 --> 23:49.259
         just transcribe        
        it into his phone       

23:49.328 --> 23:50.594
and then post it up on Facebook.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.530
  Well... [sighs] ...why would  
    Rodger kill himself now,    

23:53.566 --> 23:56.433
      when Mum's only got a     
       few months to live?      

23:56.502 --> 23:59.369
  Because of what you say here. 
          "I am weak."          

23:59.404 --> 24:00.704
        Right? He's weak!       

24:00.739 --> 24:02.540
        You know, I just        
        don't want to...        

24:02.575 --> 24:04.508
        hurt Mum any more       
         than it has to.        

24:05.444 --> 24:07.444
       You know she thinks      
       suicide is selfish.      

24:07.446 --> 24:08.678
         I mean, look at        
        the way she talks       

24:08.714 --> 24:09.946
         about Dad after        
        all these years.        

24:09.948 --> 24:12.616
     Well, then, we make it     
    so that he killed himself   

24:12.618 --> 24:14.685
       so he could be the       
       first face she sees      

24:14.720 --> 24:16.720
     when she walks through     
        the pearly gates.       

24:17.123 --> 24:18.122
           Seriously?           

24:19.292 --> 24:21.792
     Oh, Jesus, Jeff! Rodger    
        helped raise us.        

24:22.895 --> 24:24.527
         We're not even         
      killing him for what      

24:24.563 --> 24:26.530
        he did or what he       
       said he's gonna do.      

24:26.566 --> 24:28.933
      We're killing him for     
   what we think he <i> might</i> do.   

24:28.968 --> 24:30.800
       There's no "might"       
        about it, Terry.        

24:30.802 --> 24:33.069
        He gets the house       
         when Mum dies.         

24:33.105 --> 24:35.639
     She made that perfectly    
      fuckin' clear. Right?     

24:35.708 --> 24:37.607
       And he's gonna sell      
       the lot from under       

24:37.643 --> 24:39.376
         us and piss off        
       back to Queensland,      

24:39.411 --> 24:41.545
     before she's even dead     
     in the fuckin' ground!     

24:41.580 --> 24:43.279
        But he might not.       

24:43.315 --> 24:46.216
   Well, then, we kill him for  
   what he <i> has</i> done, alright?   

24:46.251 --> 24:47.317
           We kill him          
        because he left a       

24:47.319 --> 24:49.052
      perfectly good woman      
         and three kids         

24:49.087 --> 24:50.220
      to fuck our lives up.     

24:50.256 --> 24:51.455
          Or we'll kill         
         him because his        

24:51.490 --> 24:53.290
         affair with Mum        
        broke Dad's heart       

24:53.325 --> 24:54.825
     and he topped himself.     

24:54.827 --> 24:56.660
    Or we kill him because...   
             we kill            

24:56.662 --> 24:58.128
         him because of         
          these radios!         

24:58.163 --> 25:00.764
  He spent more time with these 
radios than he ever did with us.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.499
      Mate, or we kill him      
      because he's selling      

25:02.568 --> 25:04.001
      your kids' favourite      
         horse, Freddie.        

25:04.003 --> 25:06.336
 I mean, whatever works for you,
     but we're killin' him!     

25:06.405 --> 25:08.672
        Rodger has always       
       been about himself.      

25:08.740 --> 25:10.307
       He couldn't wait to      
       get away from us to      

25:10.342 --> 25:11.808
     hang out in that bloody    
        workroom of his,        

25:11.843 --> 25:13.944
   twiddling knobs and playing  
      with valves and shit!     

25:13.979 --> 25:15.746
       He spent more time       
         walking the dog        

25:15.781 --> 25:17.681
        and smoking weed        
       than being with us.      

25:17.750 --> 25:19.950
     No, no, no. Mum raised     
         us, not Rodger.        

25:19.985 --> 25:21.518
       It's not right that      
        he comes to life        

25:21.520 --> 25:23.087
         now, right when        
       Mum's about to die.      

25:24.690 --> 25:25.789
        We do this later.       

25:26.358 --> 25:28.125
     We're behind schedule.

 [Jeff] G'day, darlin'. [laughs]

26:03.895 --> 26:06.563
   - Yeah, no, Sydney's great.  
  - [city noises play on tape]  

26:06.565 --> 26:08.832
       No, no. Yeah, I'll       
      send you some photos.     

26:08.867 --> 26:11.301
    Oh, yeah, I've taken some   
      beauties. [chuckles]      

26:11.336 --> 26:13.403
   Yeah, Sydney Bridge, uh...   

26:13.405 --> 26:15.138
      And... and the Opera      
      House and the, um...      

26:15.174 --> 26:18.074
 the Aquarium, Sydney Aquarium. 
           Yeah, yeah.          

26:18.076 --> 26:20.344
       And, you know, in a      
        couple of photos,       

26:20.379 --> 26:22.479
      it almost looks like      
        Terry's smiling.        

26:22.514 --> 26:24.347
     [laughs] Yeah, I know.     

26:24.382 --> 26:26.717
   I know. No, I'm joking. No.  

26:26.752 --> 26:29.353
       Yeah. I'll... I'll       
        call you tonight.       

26:29.388 --> 26:30.220
      Alright, my darlin'.      

26:31.256 --> 26:33.223
       No, I'm being good.      
  I haven't eaten any of that.  

26:33.258 --> 26:34.692
   Alright. We'll speak soon.   

26:34.727 --> 26:36.493
         See you, love.         

26:36.528 --> 26:37.995
         Why did you say        
       we've taken photos       

26:38.030 --> 26:39.663
        and you're gonna        
         send her some?         

26:39.698 --> 26:41.765
      We can't send photos.     
   We haven't got any photos!   

26:41.767 --> 26:43.667
     It's fine. Don't worry.    
      She'll never see 'em.     

26:43.703 --> 26:45.769
         No, no, no. No,        
  she's used to disappointment. 

26:45.838 --> 26:47.171
     Don't worry about that.    

26:47.206 --> 26:49.239
     Never finished a single    
  fuckin' diet she's put me on. 

26:49.274 --> 26:51.441
     No, I'll tell her that     
     you deleted 'em. Easy.     

26:51.510 --> 26:52.442
           Why have <i> I</i>           
          deleted them?         

26:52.511 --> 26:53.677
           Alright,<i> I</i>           
          deleted them!         

26:53.712 --> 26:55.779
   Does it matter? It's fine.   
       Anyway, you're up.       

26:55.847 --> 26:58.548
      So, important thing -     
   when you're talking to Sue,  

26:58.584 --> 27:00.284
   I want you to say "Sydney"   
      as often as you can.      

27:00.353 --> 27:02.586
       Really burn it into      
   her subconscious, alright?   

27:02.621 --> 27:04.621
 - So, "Sydney, Sydney, Sydney."
         - [city noises]        

27:04.623 --> 27:07.724
  Oh, hi. It's, um... it's me.  

27:07.760 --> 27:12.362
     I'm, um... just calling    
    from, um... from Sydney.    

27:12.398 --> 27:14.464
     - [horn honks on tape]     
             - Um...            

27:14.533 --> 27:16.566
       Yeah, so, me and...      
    me and J are here and...    

27:16.602 --> 27:18.802
      it's all... it's all      
         good in Sydney.        

27:18.871 --> 27:21.404
  So, um... anyway, I'll, um... 

27:21.439 --> 27:24.741
I'll be here for... for a little
   bit... little bit longer.    

27:24.776 --> 27:26.977
 [clears throat] But I'll, um...

27:26.979 --> 27:29.313
   [clears throat] I'll, uh...  

27:29.315 --> 27:32.082
    Just thought I'd ring and   
     say hi. So, I'll, uh...    

27:32.117 --> 27:36.086
        Anyway, um... say       
         hi to the kids.        

27:36.121 --> 27:37.654
          [phone beeps]         

27:37.656 --> 27:39.657
   [clears throat, stops tape]  

27:43.729 --> 27:44.995
         That was quick.        

27:44.997 --> 27:46.763
   Yeah, couldn't get through.  

27:46.799 --> 27:49.767
     Went to her voice-mail,    
  so I... just left a message.  

27:52.738 --> 27:54.338
        [presses buttons]       

27:55.141 --> 27:56.740
       What are you doing?      

27:57.276 --> 27:58.509
              Tez.              

27:58.577 --> 28:00.344
    I'm not a fuckin' idiot.    

28:01.180 --> 28:02.780
    Why didn't you call Sue?    

28:03.849 --> 28:05.182
       You know what? Just      
        forget about it.        

28:06.651 --> 28:08.852
    Tez, I'm not gonna forget   
       about it. Alright?       

28:08.854 --> 28:12.188
    Sydney's our alibi if the   
  suicide story doesn't stick.  

28:12.257 --> 28:15.458
  Look, you're having a lovers' 
 tiff with Sue. I can see that. 

28:15.861 --> 28:18.528
 Right? But I want you to think 
     about 40 years in jail     

28:18.530 --> 28:20.464
    and get the fuck over it    
       and ring her back!       

28:20.499 --> 28:21.765
        She left me, OK?        

28:23.001 --> 28:27.004
  So now I have no alibi that's 
   not... you, Mum or Rodger.   

28:28.273 --> 28:29.373
           Happy now?           

28:30.041 --> 28:31.341
            Tch! Why?           

28:32.444 --> 28:33.977
     Why didn't you tell me?    

28:34.012 --> 28:35.211
   What does it matter to you?  

28:36.047 --> 28:37.881
   Well, I could have helped.   
        I've been there.        

28:38.483 --> 28:39.850
      I know it's not easy.     

28:39.885 --> 28:42.119
         Well, you sure         
       make it look easy.       

28:42.654 --> 28:43.887
              I do?             

28:43.889 --> 28:45.021
              Yes.              

28:45.056 --> 28:46.356
              Oh...             

28:46.391 --> 28:47.725
              Look.             

28:48.059 --> 28:48.859
             [sighs]            

28:49.862 --> 28:53.663
 We can't have any secrets with 
   each other. Not now. Right?  

28:54.399 --> 28:56.900
 If they investigate the suicide
          as a murder,          

28:57.502 --> 28:59.369
     they're gonna interview    
   more than just you and me.   

28:59.972 --> 29:02.739
  They're gonna interview Mum,  
     our families, everyone.    

29:02.741 --> 29:04.074
         And it's gonna         
       look bad if you're       

29:04.142 --> 29:05.742
         going through a        
       divorce and I'm...       

29:05.811 --> 29:07.344
             - What?            
             - What?            

29:08.847 --> 29:11.681
 Nothin'. You gotta get it right
      between you and Sue.      

29:12.317 --> 29:13.917
        Just for a couple       
        of months, right?       

29:13.919 --> 29:15.152
        Tell her whatever       
       the fuck she wants       

29:15.187 --> 29:16.586
        to hear. But make       
         it right, mate.        

29:16.655 --> 29:19.256
         - You mean lie.        
 - Yeah, lie. Lie your arse off!

29:19.258 --> 29:22.425
   And stay free. Or tell the   
     truth and go to prison.    

29:22.494 --> 29:24.027
       Pretty easy option       
         if you ask me.         

29:24.063 --> 29:26.096
   I'm a shithouse liar, Jeff.  
         You know that.         

29:26.765 --> 29:28.198
   It's why she's leaving me.   

29:28.700 --> 29:30.000
        What do you mean?       

29:30.035 --> 29:32.168
      [sighs] She asked me      
      if I still love her.      

29:32.203 --> 29:34.103
    - What did you tell her?    
          - The truth.          

29:34.105 --> 29:36.939
 - Well, why would you do that?!
 - Because I'm a shithouse liar!

29:36.941 --> 29:38.708
She can see straight through me.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.279
     I don't love her, Jeff.    
  I'm not sure that I ever did. 

29:43.014 --> 29:44.781
       Not... not really.       

29:44.850 --> 29:46.116
    You know that's bullshit.   

29:46.118 --> 29:48.951
        No, I'm serious!        
 I've been miserable for years. 

29:48.953 --> 29:50.587
Oh, I know that. That's obvious.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.722
  No, you should have left her  
    years ago. She's a bully.   

29:52.757 --> 29:54.791
         No, I mean it's        
     bullshit you can't lie.    

29:54.793 --> 29:57.227
       Anyone can lie. You      
      just didn't want to.      

29:57.262 --> 30:00.297
   Look... tell me a lie now.   
     Make it an obvious one.    

30:00.299 --> 30:01.965
      No! I don't want to!      

30:02.034 --> 30:05.135
     I'm not asking you, I'm    
     telling you! Lie to me.    

30:06.104 --> 30:08.305
OK, so, tell you an obvious lie?

30:08.373 --> 30:09.639
              Yeah.             

30:09.641 --> 30:11.274
      Alright. How about...     

30:11.309 --> 30:14.077
 I'm <i> not</i> having second thoughts 
  about what we're doing here?  

30:14.980 --> 30:17.647
       Or I'm <i> not</i> worried       
   something's gonna go wrong?  

30:18.483 --> 30:21.451
       Or I'm <i> not</i> worried       
   as to whether I can do it?   

30:21.487 --> 30:24.821
 How about... how about I'm <i> not</i> 
 worried we're gonna get caught?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.957
 Or that I'm... not seconds away

30:26.992 --> 30:29.993
   from getting on a bike and   
  getting the fuck out of here? 

30:31.497 --> 30:32.830
          How did I do?         

30:33.766 --> 30:36.333
       Jesus, Tez. Look...      

30:37.836 --> 30:39.603
    Watch me. I'll show you.    

30:41.840 --> 30:43.240
              What?             

30:45.110 --> 30:46.610
             Rodger?            

30:48.580 --> 30:49.613
              He...             

30:50.482 --> 30:52.115
    No, you can't be serious.   

30:54.486 --> 30:56.119
         Rodger's dead?         

30:57.155 --> 30:57.921
             But...             

30:58.657 --> 31:00.324
     But that's impossible.     

31:01.426 --> 31:03.860
     No, you mu... you must     
       have the wrong man.      

31:03.862 --> 31:05.261
     OK, why would he do it?    

31:06.164 --> 31:08.966
 I mean, his wife's in hospital 
        dying of cancer.        

31:09.601 --> 31:11.301
    I mean, he's a Christian.   

31:11.970 --> 31:14.137
    He thinks suicide's evil.   

31:15.507 --> 31:17.040
            Cowardly.           

31:21.714 --> 31:23.313
      How did you do that?      

31:23.349 --> 31:25.048
       [sighs] It's easy.       

31:25.517 --> 31:27.551
I just imagined myself in prison
       being arse-fucked        

31:27.620 --> 31:30.287
  by Mungo the Hairless Gorilla 
         every Thursday.        

31:30.322 --> 31:32.522
  It kind of gives me the focus 
      to achieve anything.      

31:33.692 --> 31:35.558
   You're gonna have to learn   
        how to lie, Tez.        

31:35.627 --> 31:38.628
      What are you gonna do     
   when Mum needs comforting?   

31:39.131 --> 31:41.030
     When she's asking you,     
     "Why did Rodger do it?"    

31:41.500 --> 31:42.832
        You're gonna have       
         to lie to her,         

31:42.868 --> 31:44.634
       and lie to her with      
         all your heart.        

31:45.237 --> 31:49.239
    Now, we've got 10 minutes   
  before the next agenda item.  

31:49.241 --> 31:52.576
     I suggest you use it to    
 practise staying out of prison.

31:55.481 --> 32:00.850
  [Terry] On Saturday, I was in 
  Sydney with my brother, Jeff. 

32:00.886 --> 32:02.986
We were just having a weekend...

32:03.021 --> 32:05.421
      [clears throat] Where     
       was I on Saturday?       

32:05.423 --> 32:10.427
  On Saturday, uh, I was in...  
  Sydney with my brother, Jeff. 

32:10.496 --> 32:12.362
       But if you checked       
       our phone records,       

32:12.397 --> 32:14.230
 that would show that our ph... 
         that our ph...         

32:14.266 --> 32:16.500
         that we were in        
      Sydney, wouldn't it?      

32:17.102 --> 32:18.534
              Fuck!             

32:18.570 --> 32:20.002
You can check our phone records.

32:20.038 --> 32:21.738
   The GPS in the phone would   
         show that we...        

32:21.773 --> 32:23.273
        [sighs] Oh, fuck!       

32:23.275 --> 32:26.276
   That would indicate that...  
         [clears throat]        

32:27.613 --> 32:30.747
    Where was I on Saturday?    
            I was...            

32:30.782 --> 32:32.449
          [voice fades]         

32:51.603 --> 32:54.103
 [Jeff] OK. Best-case scenario. 

32:54.139 --> 32:56.139
      Rodger comes through      
         the front door,        

32:56.207 --> 32:58.708
       works his way into       
      the, uh, living room.     

32:58.743 --> 33:01.778
   Sees us wearing the masks,   
   thinks we'll rob the place.  

33:01.813 --> 33:03.747
        I'll tell him to        
       comply, he agrees,       

33:03.782 --> 33:05.381
        and then we move        
         on from there.         

33:05.416 --> 33:07.884
  Now, I know it sounds simple, 
   but we should rehearse it.   

33:07.919 --> 33:10.921
        You play Rodger.        
  Come in and I'll do the rest. 

33:10.956 --> 33:12.222
              - OK.             
           - Alright?           

33:12.257 --> 33:13.823
              Yep.              

33:13.892 --> 33:15.592
 No, no, don't go out the front!

33:15.627 --> 33:16.793
         No, no, no, no.        
             Just...            

33:16.828 --> 33:18.595
       Someone'll see you.      
          Just pretend.         

33:20.465 --> 33:21.832
           You right?           

33:21.900 --> 33:24.100
      Yeah, yeah. I'm good.     

33:24.135 --> 33:28.671
     OK. So, opens the door,    
        closes the door.        

33:28.740 --> 33:30.574
            Comes in,           

33:30.609 --> 33:32.442
        opens the door--        

33:32.477 --> 33:35.178
  Don't move! Do as you're told 
     and you won't get hurt!    

33:36.948 --> 33:38.315
            Oh, um...           

33:38.350 --> 33:39.982
         [woodenly] Oh,         
       please don't shoot       

33:40.018 --> 33:41.484
    me. Take whatever you...    
             [sighs]            

33:41.520 --> 33:44.521
  J, this... this really makes  
         my face itchy.         

33:46.024 --> 33:48.024
       You'll get over it.      

33:48.026 --> 33:49.859
       Alright, let's just      
      assume he's complied      

33:49.861 --> 33:51.361
         and we'll move         
        on to phase two.        

33:55.701 --> 33:57.334
           [cow moos]           

34:07.846 --> 34:10.880
  Why would Rodger hang himself 
     where Dad shot himself?    

34:10.949 --> 34:13.382
      Why wouldn't he... do     
       it in his workroom?      

34:13.385 --> 34:15.784
       For the same reason      
         he didn't sell         

34:15.820 --> 34:17.987
        Dad's tractor or        
        any of his cars.        

34:18.023 --> 34:19.155
           It's guilt.          

34:19.190 --> 34:21.190
    Well, that, and the roof    
      can take his weight.      

34:22.661 --> 34:23.326
           Oh, right.           

34:23.362 --> 34:25.128
     Alright, on your knees.    

34:25.864 --> 34:27.496
    Uh, it's not gonna work.    

34:27.532 --> 34:30.900
    Rodger's got a dodgy hip.   
Can't even put his own socks on.

34:30.969 --> 34:33.570
  I don't think he'll get down  
  there. Plus, it'll hurt him.  

34:34.505 --> 34:36.405
 What does it matter? He's gonna
  be dead three minutes later.  

34:36.407 --> 34:38.842
    Yeah, but there's no need   
       for him to suffer.       

34:43.849 --> 34:45.348
        Alright, Rodger.        

34:45.384 --> 34:47.516
       Uh, how do we know       
       his name's Rodger?       

34:49.154 --> 34:51.721
  Alright, Shit-Features. Sit.  

34:57.061 --> 34:59.095
      Now, I'll get Rodger      
     to wear these, but for     

34:59.097 --> 35:00.997
      now, we'll just work      
        with your gloves.       

35:01.032 --> 35:02.431
       You're not worried       
         he's gonna ask         

35:02.500 --> 35:04.000
         why he's got to        
          wear gloves?          

35:04.036 --> 35:06.236
       Not particularly. I      
      couldn't give a shit.     

35:06.271 --> 35:08.104
       No, the gloves are       
          so that if he         

35:08.106 --> 35:10.039
       scratches us during      
          the struggle,         

35:10.075 --> 35:11.607
        won't get our DNA       
        under his nails.        

35:11.609 --> 35:13.510
       You watch a lot of       
       those crime shows.       

35:13.545 --> 35:16.113
It's always the shit under their
 nails that get 'em in the end. 

35:16.548 --> 35:17.380
            Alright.            

35:18.750 --> 35:19.916
           How's that?          

35:19.952 --> 35:21.384
           Yeah, good.          

35:21.420 --> 35:24.387
          Oh, actually,         
 I can kind of see a little bit.

35:24.423 --> 35:25.454
             Really?            

35:25.456 --> 35:28.792
    It's hard to say. Not...    
            not much.           

35:29.694 --> 35:31.528
  Just let me adjust it a bit.  

35:32.931 --> 35:34.898
     I think that's better.     

35:36.134 --> 35:38.235
         [ominous music]        

35:41.707 --> 35:43.472
         How about now?         

35:43.541 --> 35:46.876
 I can kind of see a silhouette.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.312
   Like a ghost or something.   

35:51.817 --> 35:55.585
 Well, we're not trying to help 
 him take a nap. It'll be fine. 

36:11.169 --> 36:14.471
        [windmill creaks]       

36:20.678 --> 36:22.179
     [Terry] Food in a tube.    

36:22.514 --> 36:23.679
              Yeah.             

36:23.681 --> 36:25.182
          It's clever.          

36:25.584 --> 36:27.284
           No crumbs.           

36:28.853 --> 36:31.521
 Think if Dad could see us now, 
      he'd approve of this?     

36:36.862 --> 36:37.961
               No.              

36:39.130 --> 36:40.764
    But he'd be proud of us.    

36:41.533 --> 36:43.433
 For looking out for each other.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.269
     Protecting what's ours.    

36:49.774 --> 36:52.808
   You know, I spoke to Rodger  
         about the will.        

36:52.844 --> 36:53.710
            You what?           

36:53.712 --> 36:55.645
        Well, I just told       
       him we were upset.       

36:55.680 --> 36:59.015
   You know, and said it's...   
    it's Dad's house, that--    

36:59.050 --> 37:02.218
    I know the intricacies of   
  our fucking complaint, Terry. 

37:02.220 --> 37:03.552
      What did Rodger say?      

37:03.554 --> 37:04.888
Well, he said it was Mum's call.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.559
   But he promised when he...   
          when he died,         

37:09.627 --> 37:11.661
       that he'd make sure      
  the house was returned to us. 

37:11.696 --> 37:12.661
          When <i> he</i> dies?         

37:12.697 --> 37:14.363
       Yeah, he said he'd       
       put it in his will       

37:14.399 --> 37:16.699
   and... you know, make sure   
       everyone was happy.      

37:16.734 --> 37:19.235
      Everybody'd be hap...     
        That's frog shit.       

37:19.303 --> 37:22.072
   What about his first wife?   
         His real kids?         

37:22.574 --> 37:25.074
He might even have a brother and
sister we've never heard about. 

37:25.076 --> 37:27.076
     People he's owed money     
       to or fucked over.       

37:27.745 --> 37:29.812
 No, mate, they'll all come out 
 of the woodwork when Mum dies. 

37:30.581 --> 37:32.715
 Mate, he left his first family 
       hanging in the wind      

37:32.751 --> 37:35.252
        to come and play        
    part-time daddy with us.    

37:36.721 --> 37:37.853
               No.              

37:37.889 --> 37:40.890
      Yeah, well, the same      
    could be said about you.    

37:40.925 --> 37:43.593
        You got divorced.       
          You cheated.          

37:44.763 --> 37:46.429
       You've got kids to       
      two different women.      

37:46.431 --> 37:47.764
   Totally fuckin' different!   

37:49.000 --> 37:52.001
      I love my kids. I did     
      everything for Mary.      

37:52.570 --> 37:55.238
    No, that crazy bitch got    
   everything she ever wanted.  

37:55.273 --> 37:57.340
       The house. The car.      

37:57.375 --> 37:59.709
      That fuckin'... Louis     
       Devonne bag thing.       

37:59.744 --> 38:01.878
        She's happier now       
   than when we were together.  

38:01.913 --> 38:05.548
No. Rodger's got our dad's blood
         on his hands.          

38:05.950 --> 38:09.419
      And the older I get,      
    the clearer that becomes.   

38:11.923 --> 38:15.424
  The real mystery is, what the 
    fuck does Mum see in him?   

38:16.260 --> 38:19.762
 Well, he's just got to buy her 
   flowers every now and then   

38:19.798 --> 38:21.864
  and not hit her like Dad did, 
    and I guess she's happy.    

38:21.899 --> 38:24.634
    Hey, you shut your mouth.   
         You were a kid.        

38:24.636 --> 38:26.101
       I saw things happen      
          in that house         

38:26.137 --> 38:27.103
          you wouldn't          
        fuckin' believe.        

38:27.805 --> 38:30.707
      He did his best. Dad      
        tried real hard.        

38:30.742 --> 38:33.143
    I know he made mistakes,    
      but he fuckin' tried.     

38:33.211 --> 38:34.810
        And who knows, if       
       Rodger hadn't have       

38:34.812 --> 38:36.646
      come along, he could      
         have come good,        

38:36.648 --> 38:39.082
    and we wouldn't be having   
   this fuckin' conversation.   

38:39.951 --> 38:42.552
   So, you show some respect.   

38:49.294 --> 38:51.094
           [Jeff] OK.           

38:51.129 --> 38:55.565
So, the last two rehearsals have
 relied on Rodger playing ball. 

38:55.600 --> 38:58.902
       But if he doesn't,       
 then we've got the last option.

39:00.272 --> 39:02.471
    - The ice junkie option.    
           - Exactly.           

39:03.274 --> 39:07.510
  OK. Let's say Rodger comes in 
 and we lay out our intentions. 

39:08.146 --> 39:09.445
        He does a runner.       

39:10.014 --> 39:11.147
       We're not gonna be       
         able to make it        

39:11.182 --> 39:12.749
           look like a          
       believable suicide.      

39:12.784 --> 39:14.684
       Yeah, but, I mean,       
       think about it. How      

39:14.752 --> 39:16.452
       fast do you really       
        think he can run?       

39:16.487 --> 39:19.655
Couldn't we just grab him before
   he... shoots out the door?   

39:19.691 --> 39:24.327
   No. We can't have bruises.   
 No scuffs, no scratches. Right?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.796
     A botched fake suicide     
         is gonna create        

39:26.831 --> 39:28.797
       much more suspicion      
         than a murder.         

39:28.833 --> 39:33.536
 So, let's assume he's come in, 
   freaked out, done a runner.  

39:33.872 --> 39:36.205
  We need to make it look like  
      we were ice junkies.      

39:36.274 --> 39:37.840
     He came in, interrupted    
           us while we          

39:37.875 --> 39:39.608
        were robbing the        
       place off our tits.      

39:40.044 --> 39:42.278
        You can just say        
     "junkie." I don't think    

39:42.314 --> 39:44.447
      it matters what kind      
        of junkie we are.       

39:44.483 --> 39:47.283
Regardless, there's a few things
    we're gonna have to do.     

39:47.318 --> 39:48.451
          First of all,         

39:49.620 --> 39:51.553
    we're gonna have to throw   
   a whole lot of shit around.  

39:51.555 --> 39:53.222
Right? Junkies are messy people.

39:53.991 --> 39:57.160
 Eat some food out of the fridge
    and get the right weapon.   

39:57.662 --> 40:00.830
    I think it's the stoners    
     that get the munchies,     

40:00.865 --> 40:02.031
      not the ice junkies.      

40:03.134 --> 40:05.635
      Anyway, why can't we      
        just use the gun?       

40:06.571 --> 40:09.572
Because a meth-head is not gonna
   stumble across Dad's gun.    

40:09.574 --> 40:11.641
      No, no, that's never      
          gonna happen.         

40:12.243 --> 40:14.043
             No, no.            

40:14.079 --> 40:15.344
          We use this.          

40:15.379 --> 40:16.845
         - A box cutter?        
             - Yeah.            

40:16.881 --> 40:18.648
      Why can't we just use     
        a regular knife?        

40:19.417 --> 40:21.017
        I've been doing a       
        bit of research.        

40:21.052 --> 40:23.052
       You know, watching       
    a lot of YouTube videos.    

40:23.088 --> 40:24.720
     Junkies caught on CCTV.    

40:24.756 --> 40:26.356
  Now, I don't know what it is, 

40:26.391 --> 40:28.257
       but whether they're      
       robbing a 7-Eleven       

40:28.259 --> 40:29.859
        or some old chick       
        for her handbag,        

40:29.894 --> 40:31.861
ice junkies seem to have a thing
        for box cutters.        

40:32.664 --> 40:34.430
     So let's be authentic.     

40:34.432 --> 40:35.832
              - OK?             
             - Yeah.            

40:35.867 --> 40:37.667
    - Now, important thing--    
            - Mm-hm?            

40:37.702 --> 40:39.768
        When we kill him,       
        we kill him dead.       

40:40.171 --> 40:41.570
     Isn't that a tautology?    

40:42.440 --> 40:44.941
  I mean, if we've killed him,  
      obviously he's dead.      

40:44.943 --> 40:47.777
        No, Tez. I think        
       you'd be surprised.      

40:47.779 --> 40:49.511
       It's not that easy       
         to kill a man.         

40:49.547 --> 40:51.580
       We can't just stab       
       him like a fuckin'       

40:51.616 --> 40:53.416
      pincushion. It's not      
        good for anybody.       

40:53.451 --> 40:55.517
    Yeah, especially Rodger.    

40:55.553 --> 40:57.419
      Exactly, because then     
        we've got to sit        

40:57.455 --> 40:59.288
       around and wait for      
        him to bleed out.       

40:59.891 --> 41:02.625
      No, no. The secret is     
   to do what the Romans did.   

41:03.294 --> 41:05.462
      Now, the Romans, when     
       they won a battle,       

41:06.231 --> 41:07.630
          all the enemy         
         would be lying         

41:07.699 --> 41:08.932
        around dying and        
        injured and shit.       

41:09.901 --> 41:12.635
        The Romans would        
        mercy-kill them.        

41:12.704 --> 41:13.770
       Spike to the heart.      

41:14.705 --> 41:16.105
 It's quicker. More honourable. 

41:16.774 --> 41:19.809
    But what they wouldn't do   
 is stab them in the front here.

41:20.378 --> 41:22.378
      It's too hard. Bone.      

41:22.413 --> 41:25.481
They'd come in under the armpit,
        where it's soft.        

41:26.084 --> 41:29.118
  Straight in under the chest,  
 into the heart. Instant death. 

41:31.222 --> 41:34.823
      What, so the junkies      
   now take their inspiration   

41:34.892 --> 41:37.493
        from the ancient        
        Romans, do they?        

41:37.495 --> 41:39.962
     Well, we don't make it     
      look obvious. Right?      

41:40.431 --> 41:42.298
      We stab him in a few      
       other places, makes      

41:42.334 --> 41:43.666
        it look like the        
        junkie got lucky.       

41:44.235 --> 41:45.835
     But if you're concerned    
          about Rodger,         

41:46.804 --> 41:48.070
        you do him in the       
          heart first,          

41:48.105 --> 41:50.139
 then do all the other stabbing 
        after he's dead.        

41:50.909 --> 41:53.643
  That way, he doesn't feel it. 
           Make sense?          

41:54.345 --> 41:55.444
     So, let's rehearse it.     

41:55.480 --> 41:56.913
  Do you want to be the stabber 

41:56.948 --> 41:59.082
        or do you want to       
         be the stabbed?        

42:06.758 --> 42:08.791
      [sighs] Jesus, Terry.     

42:09.828 --> 42:11.861
   Here. You're gonna have to   
       clean all that up.       

42:11.930 --> 42:14.697
     I guarantee there'll be    
    shitloads of DNA in spew.   

42:16.033 --> 42:19.968
  If things go down this way -  
     the ice junkie option -    

42:20.004 --> 42:22.138
        do you think he's       
       gonna know it's us?      

42:22.673 --> 42:23.806
             Terry.             

42:23.841 --> 42:25.441
        You're gonna have       
       to get used to the       

42:25.476 --> 42:26.709
      fact that it's highly     
         likely he will.        

42:27.378 --> 42:28.778
  Anyway, what does it matter?  

42:28.813 --> 42:30.046
       It's not like he's       
     gonna be around to lay     

42:30.114 --> 42:31.781
       a guilt trip on you      
      at Christmas dinner.      

42:31.816 --> 42:34.317
    I just don't want him to    
  know it's me before he dies.  

42:35.053 --> 42:38.487
     Here. Scoop it all up,     
 put it in the dam, wash it out.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.223
    And I'm talking spotless!   

42:42.226 --> 42:43.693
             [sighs]            

43:10.255 --> 43:11.888
        [horse whickers]        

43:21.333 --> 43:22.765
          Hey, Freddie.         

43:22.833 --> 43:24.834
    [Freddie nickers softly]    

44:11.716 --> 44:13.316
           Mr Muggins.          

44:14.619 --> 44:16.052
           [chuckles]           

44:18.789 --> 44:20.223
     I'm proud of you, Tez.     

44:29.134 --> 44:31.767
 You know, through all of this, 
     we haven't talked about    

44:31.803 --> 44:34.103
       what we're gonna do      
   with the place afterwards.   

44:34.805 --> 44:36.606
  Yeah? What are you thinking?  

44:36.641 --> 44:38.941
  Well, the place could do with 
        a lick of paint.        

44:40.144 --> 44:41.744
        Bit of a tidy up.       

44:43.281 --> 44:47.016
   We could bring the kids up   
 and do a bit of a working bee. 

44:48.319 --> 44:50.319
    Be nice to buy new horses   
        for them to ride.       

44:51.422 --> 44:52.755
      It'd be good to bring     
        the kids up here        

44:52.791 --> 44:53.956
        a bit more often.       
        Don't you think?        

44:53.992 --> 44:55.324
  - What are you talking about? 
             - Hmm?             

44:56.427 --> 44:58.527
        Are you seriously       
      thinking of bringing      

44:58.529 --> 45:00.095
          the kids back         
        into this house?        

45:00.131 --> 45:03.199
  The same house we straight-up 
    murdered their poppy in?    

45:04.368 --> 45:06.034
           Well, yeah.          

45:06.036 --> 45:07.703
        Mate, neither of        
        us are candidates       

45:07.705 --> 45:08.804
           for Father           
          of the Year,          

45:08.840 --> 45:09.872
  but are you hearing yourself? 

45:10.541 --> 45:14.210
      Well, I don't mean...     
   next week or straightaway,   

45:14.278 --> 45:15.211
      but eventually, yeah.     

45:16.180 --> 45:18.214
I mean, this is the family home.

45:18.683 --> 45:20.116
          Dad's legacy.         

45:21.385 --> 45:23.886
      He's the only reason      
   we're sitting here, right?   

45:26.557 --> 45:27.957
     Yep. Yes, you're right.    

45:27.992 --> 45:29.859
      That's what Dad would     
      have wanted. I'm j...     

45:30.628 --> 45:33.195
        Mate... I'm just        
        being pragmatic.        

45:33.231 --> 45:34.897
      I mean, Tez, really,      
         for God's sake,        

45:34.966 --> 45:36.565
      did you really think      
         that the two of        

45:36.567 --> 45:38.033
       us would just bring      
        our kids up here        

45:38.069 --> 45:39.869
        and live like the       
      fuckin' Brady Bunch?      

45:40.738 --> 45:42.404
       No, no, we have to       
         sell the place.        

45:42.473 --> 45:45.742
     The house has no value.    
 Rodger ran it into the ground. 

45:46.411 --> 45:48.210
   No, it's... it's the land.   

45:48.245 --> 45:50.179
        It's the land and       
       all of his antique       

45:50.214 --> 45:51.980
      radios. That's where      
          the value is.         

45:52.016 --> 45:54.917
 No. No, mate, we have to sell. 

45:55.986 --> 45:58.020
   And Dad would say the same.  

46:08.566 --> 46:10.199
         [groans softly]        

46:13.938 --> 46:16.239
         Why haven't you        
        had that seen to?       

46:16.774 --> 46:18.241
              What?             

46:19.243 --> 46:19.942
           Your tooth.          

46:21.212 --> 46:23.012
        It's not like you       
 to put up with pain like that. 

46:24.015 --> 46:26.115
    You're normally the first   
 to go straight to the doctor's 

46:26.117 --> 46:28.251
      the second you think      
       there's a problem.       

46:30.288 --> 46:31.554
      What are you saying?      

46:32.523 --> 46:34.524
  That fancy new job of yours.  

46:35.293 --> 46:36.926
         What about it?         

46:36.961 --> 46:39.128
   It doesn't exist, does it?   

46:42.566 --> 46:43.800
      You don't have a job.     

46:44.969 --> 46:47.970
 Jesus, Jeff, why can't you just
      come out and say it?      

46:49.273 --> 46:53.142
   That's why we're here. Not   
 because of Dad or what's right.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.446
         You're bankrupt        
       again, aren't you?       

46:59.216 --> 47:00.383
             Terry.             

47:02.152 --> 47:05.054
  You don't have to be hard up  
    to do bad shit for money.   

47:06.624 --> 47:08.925
       If you've got none,      
         you want some,         

47:09.827 --> 47:11.460
        and if you've got       
      some, you want more.      

47:12.563 --> 47:14.664
        It's just the way       
       the world is, mate.      

47:14.732 --> 47:16.331
        It's never enough       

47:16.400 --> 47:19.168
  and there's always some prick 
 who wants to take it from you. 

47:22.606 --> 47:26.008
   Jeff, if you're in trouble   
again, I can lend you the money!

47:26.076 --> 47:28.010
      No secrets, remember?     

47:28.012 --> 47:31.246
    Look, it's not too late.    
     We can just leave now.     

47:32.149 --> 47:35.016
    Hey, look, tomorrow, OK,    
 we can go to the bank together.

47:35.085 --> 47:38.120
 I can take out a loan for you, 
        no worries. Hey?        

47:38.155 --> 47:40.189
        I'd be happy to.        
        What do you say?        

47:40.191 --> 47:42.691
      I'm not loaning money     
     off my little brother.     

47:42.759 --> 47:44.092
            Why not?            

47:44.128 --> 47:47.029
    I mean, fuck pride, bro.    
         That's just...         

47:47.098 --> 47:49.165
      that's just bullshit      
        that Dad fed you.       

47:49.867 --> 47:52.034
  Look, I know we're different. 

47:52.670 --> 47:54.936
        OK, I don't live        
       my life with Dad's       

47:54.972 --> 47:56.772
        voice in my head        
          like you do.          

47:56.807 --> 48:00.843
   And yes, I'm sorry I wasn't  
 straight with you at the start.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.879
         OK, Sue has had        
        my mind spinning.       

48:03.948 --> 48:06.882
       She's talking about      
     taking the kids off me.    

48:07.352 --> 48:09.384
        I've been... I've       
        been living in a        

48:09.386 --> 48:11.854
      fucking caravan park      
       for the last month.      

48:12.657 --> 48:15.490
  OK? So, things are not going  
    great for the both of us.   

48:15.526 --> 48:17.894
        - [clock chimes]        
 - But we don't need to do this.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.496
    OK? It's ridiculous, bro.   
       I mean, look at us.      

48:21.532 --> 48:24.733
      We're dressed up like     
  a couple of fucking pumpkins! 

48:24.802 --> 48:26.035
           - Shut up!           
           - If you...          

48:26.403 --> 48:27.503
             Listen.

      [vehicle approaches]      

48:40.585 --> 48:42.017
               Oh!              

48:42.053 --> 48:44.253
    Fuck, he's early! [pants]   

48:44.255 --> 48:47.756
 J, I don't want to do this. OK?

48:47.825 --> 48:49.391
           OK. Right.           

48:49.427 --> 48:52.027
     Remember, don't let him    
       see you until he's       

48:52.062 --> 48:54.363
       come in and closed       
      the door behind him.      

48:54.398 --> 48:56.432
         J! Did you hear        
       what I just said?!       

48:56.434 --> 48:58.767
     - Balaclava! Put it on!    
       - [car door closes]      

48:58.835 --> 49:00.436
              Move!             

49:00.905 --> 49:02.505
              Shit!

49:25.095 --> 49:26.929
       [whispers] What the      
        fuck's he doing?!       

49:26.964 --> 49:27.963
           [whispers]           
            Shut up!            

49:28.031 --> 49:29.465
      [keys rattle in lock]     

49:34.138 --> 49:35.538
     Do you think he knows?     

49:40.544 --> 49:43.479
   [Jeff] Oh, yeah, you've got  
     bigger problems, Rodge.    

49:46.617 --> 49:47.983
           Fuck! Fuck!          

49:48.052 --> 49:49.251
   What the fuck's he doing?!   

49:49.286 --> 49:51.153
 Round the back. Round the back!

       [car pulls around]       

50:02.500 --> 50:03.632
            Oh, shit!           

50:06.671 --> 50:09.505
    - Do you think he saw us?   
     - No, I don't think so.    

50:09.507 --> 50:11.974
  He's not even inside and this 
    shit's going pear-shaped!   

50:12.009 --> 50:13.675
       - [car door closes]      
       - Rubbish! Stop it!      

50:13.677 --> 50:15.611
This is nothing! Just stay calm!

50:18.950 --> 50:21.117
      Fuck! Freddie's out!      

50:24.088 --> 50:25.520
       [Terry] What if he       
         calls the cops?        

50:25.589 --> 50:27.689
It doesn't matter if he comes in
         and finds us.          

50:27.691 --> 50:30.159
 It's our home. We haven't done 
       anything wrong yet.      

50:33.430 --> 50:34.530
              Fuck!             

50:35.632 --> 50:38.934
 OK, look. If he comes in here, 
        he didn't see us.       

50:38.969 --> 50:40.602
         Everything goes        
        as normal, right?       

50:40.637 --> 50:43.105
    If he goes to his car, he   
 spends too much time out there,

50:43.140 --> 50:44.940
  he's called the cops, right?  

50:44.976 --> 50:46.208
        We take all this        
        shit off, we tell       

50:46.277 --> 50:47.676
         him we're here         
         to see Freddie.        

50:47.711 --> 50:49.478
         OK, good. Good.        

50:50.614 --> 50:52.547
    Nup. I reckon he saw us.    
         Let's just say         

50:52.549 --> 50:54.516
     hello and forget about     
        the whole thing.        

50:54.551 --> 50:55.818
              Shh!              

50:55.853 --> 50:57.820
       [footsteps outside]      

51:16.807 --> 51:18.340
             Hello?             

51:23.314 --> 51:24.580
             Terry?             

51:25.683 --> 51:27.149
        Are you in there?       

51:29.720 --> 51:30.753
             Hello?             

51:31.489 --> 51:32.888
        [whispers] Terry.       

51:32.923 --> 51:35.023
  Answer him. Get him in here.  

51:35.058 --> 51:37.159
     Then back to our plan.     

51:38.829 --> 51:40.429
               No!              

51:43.100 --> 51:44.900
  [Rodger] If th... if there's  
       somebody in there,       

51:44.935 --> 51:48.270
  then y-you'd better get out,  
 because I-I'm calling the cops.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.238
             Terry!             

51:50.274 --> 51:53.208
    You fuckin' do it! Or you   
   and I are fuckin' finished!  

51:53.244 --> 51:55.176
Choosing Rodger over me and Dad?

51:55.212 --> 51:58.414
            - What?!            
 - You heard me! Get out there! 

52:02.553 --> 52:04.120
          [Terry] Fuck!         

52:04.956 --> 52:06.522
   - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!   
            - What?!            

52:08.125 --> 52:09.692
            Oh, fuck!           

52:18.969 --> 52:20.369
           Hi, Rodge.           

52:20.404 --> 52:21.704
              Hell!             

52:21.739 --> 52:22.904
          It's just me.         

52:22.939 --> 52:24.473
             Hello.             

52:29.980 --> 52:32.614
  Oh, shit, boy, you scared me! 

52:32.649 --> 52:34.483
        Sorry about that.       

52:34.485 --> 52:37.152
And you can't leave the feed out
 like that. It attracts vermin. 

52:37.721 --> 52:39.155
        And you left the        
        gate open again.        

52:40.123 --> 52:42.491
    Yeah, I was just about to   
       go back out there.       

52:43.594 --> 52:44.960
  Put the kettle on, will you?  
             I need             

52:44.995 --> 52:46.428
          something to          
        settle my nerves.       

52:47.098 --> 52:49.765
   Ticker's working overtime.   

52:53.337 --> 52:55.738
      What's going on here?     

53:00.811 --> 53:01.477
        What do you mean?       

53:02.446 --> 53:04.512
       Well, you... you're      
       not a bloody troll.      

53:04.514 --> 53:07.349
      Turn some lights on,      
         for God's sake!        

53:12.089 --> 53:14.456
     Well, the kettle isn't     
       gonna boil itself.       

53:15.125 --> 53:16.525
              Yeah.

53:26.771 --> 53:29.204
      You know, I might be      
       getting old, but I       

53:29.273 --> 53:31.307
       didn't notice your       
      car in the driveway.      

53:36.681 --> 53:38.280
         Yeah, I, uh...         

53:39.683 --> 53:41.650
         ...broke down.         
      [switches kettle on]      

53:42.519 --> 53:45.553
   Oh, shit, no. How far away?  

53:45.555 --> 53:49.291
     Only about a 15-minute     
          walk or so...         

53:49.827 --> 53:51.327
            I'd say.            

53:56.968 --> 53:58.367
        Is it the Volvo?        

54:01.038 --> 54:02.238
              Mmm.              

54:02.706 --> 54:03.906
             Where?             

54:04.909 --> 54:07.576
       Uh, it was... down       
         on Dukes Road.         

54:09.146 --> 54:11.547
          Are you sure?         
   I just drove through there.  

54:12.416 --> 54:15.718
       Yeah, I... arranged      
        to have it towed.       

54:19.423 --> 54:21.390
   And what's your excuse for   
  those bloody awful overalls?  

54:22.759 --> 54:24.994
 Has there been a nuclear spill 
     I haven't heard about?

         [kettle dings]         

54:26.763 --> 54:29.664
  No, I just had 'em in the...  
         back of my car,        

54:29.700 --> 54:31.767
and when I looked at the engine,
    I thought I'd put 'em on    

54:31.769 --> 54:33.035
       just so I don't get      
       oil on my clothes.       

54:34.571 --> 54:37.072
   Shame you weren't that OCD   
    when you were growing up,   

54:37.108 --> 54:40.275
     because I swear there's    
   still bacteria in that room  

54:40.343 --> 54:42.278

         put a name to.         

54:48.919 --> 54:50.286
             You OK?            

54:51.555 --> 54:52.721
              Yeah.             

54:59.896 --> 55:01.463
            Rodger...           

55:06.437 --> 55:09.038
   did you know my dad before   
    you and Mum got married?    

55:10.808 --> 55:12.875
       Oh, no, not really.      

55:15.146 --> 55:16.445
       Well, not early on.      

55:17.447 --> 55:19.948
     You know, when I first     
      met your mum, I'd...      

55:19.983 --> 55:23.819
  just flown in to install the  
   phones at the post office.   

55:25.089 --> 55:27.322
 She came in a few times, but...

55:27.391 --> 55:29.491
  I don't remember your father  
         being with her.        

55:30.126 --> 55:31.727
    He may have been, though.   

55:33.063 --> 55:34.496
            Why, son?           

55:35.765 --> 55:38.133
        So, the fact that       
       you didn't know him      

55:38.168 --> 55:40.436
 probably made it easier for you

55:41.071 --> 55:42.638
     when he killed himself.    

55:45.809 --> 55:46.508
            [scoffs]            

55:47.344 --> 55:49.912
        Jesus, none of it       
         was easy, mate.        

55:51.081 --> 55:54.016
      You know, it was all      
      a terrible business.      

55:54.951 --> 55:56.518
       Terrible business?       

55:59.856 --> 56:00.922
              Yeah.             

56:00.957 --> 56:02.257
         [clears throat]        

56:02.292 --> 56:04.660
 How was it a terrible business?

56:07.331 --> 56:08.997
     Well, your father's...     

56:11.535 --> 56:12.868
       No-one expected it.      

56:14.204 --> 56:17.873
  Most of all, your mother, who 
 took it very hard, as you know.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.976
    And of course, you boys.    

56:22.446 --> 56:24.012
       What about us boys?      

56:25.982 --> 56:28.817
  Well, not you so much, 'cause 
   you were only seven, but...  

56:30.220 --> 56:32.521
  it affected Jeff very deeply. 

56:33.790 --> 56:37.059
 You know, he completely closed 
   down for a couple of weeks.  

56:39.129 --> 56:42.297
  Then when he finally did talk 
  to me, he made it very clear  

56:42.332 --> 56:47.169
  that, you know, you boys had  
 one father and one father only.

56:49.506 --> 56:50.706
         [Terry] He did?        

56:52.042 --> 56:54.476
 [Rodger] Yeah, well, of course.
       I understood that.       

56:55.913 --> 56:58.847
You know, it isn't easy stepping
   into another man's shoes.    

57:00.083 --> 57:03.585
   You know, especially under   
       such circumstances.      

57:05.755 --> 57:07.923
      [Terry] You probably      
         preferred to...        

57:08.759 --> 57:10.926
  spend time with your radios.  

57:13.430 --> 57:15.764
     That's a little harsh,     
     don't you think, Terry?    

57:16.667 --> 57:19.435
       What I meant was I       
         respected that.        

57:20.437 --> 57:22.570
       And I made it clear      
       to him that I would      

57:22.606 --> 57:25.107
      never take the place      
         of your father.        

57:30.548 --> 57:33.014
  You know, what happened back  
   then was hard on you both,   

57:33.049 --> 57:36.452
   it was hard on your mother,  
     and it was hard on me.     

57:40.123 --> 57:44.059
 Was it as hard as leaving your 
  own kids back in Queensland?  

57:49.199 --> 57:53.035
 OK, look, yeah, I can see that 
  you're upset about something, 

57:53.070 --> 57:54.602
      so... just tell me--      

57:54.638 --> 57:56.805
    - Do you want some milk?    
        - No, thank you.        

57:58.275 --> 57:59.241
      I don't want any tea.     

58:00.710 --> 58:03.479
  You know, I've had a long day 
   with your mother's doctors.  

58:04.748 --> 58:07.315
      And I've still got to     
     brush and shoe Freddie.    

58:07.317 --> 58:09.084
        Now, I don't know       
        what's going on,        

58:09.986 --> 58:11.653
           but before           
        either of us say        

58:11.722 --> 58:14.289
        something that we       
        can't take back,        

58:14.324 --> 58:16.558
        let's just settle       
        this conversation

         bit and try...

     This. Put them on him.     
         Bind his hands.        

58:34.311 --> 58:36.311
           - Quickly!           
        - [Rodger groans]       

58:36.346 --> 58:38.246
       Don't fuckin' move!      

58:38.281 --> 58:39.614
        OK. Bind them up.

       Here, put this on.

        Come around here.       
    Put it on back to front.

        Come on, come on!

     to be involved in this

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:13.789
      OK, you get dressed,      
        I'll prep Rodger.

    OK. We've got a problem.    

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:18.520
       Rodger's phone. It       
        needs a password.       

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:21.923
         Do you know it?

       gonna turn it off.       

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:24.405
     [mutters] It doesn't...    

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.176

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:42.156

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:44.792
         Rodger killing         
       himself like that,       

01:12:45.328 --> 01:12:46.861
      when we just happened     
       to be in the house,      

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.098
      is gonna stand up to      
      any kind of scrutiny?     

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:51.699
         It'll have to!         

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:54.635
    Maybe if Mum wasn't here.   

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.004
         Think about it.

  [sighs] Our bullshit alibis.  

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.443
    The lies we've told Mum.    

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.045
    There's no suicide note.    

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:07.514
    And the fact that Rodger    
   pulled her out of hospital   

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.717
    and brought her here and    
  popped in for a quick tidy up 

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:12.053
   and thought, "Oh, fuck it.   
            I'm out."           

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:14.722
    None of it will stand up.   

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:17.692
 - And you heard what she said. 
             - What?            

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.127
         "Why didn't he         
       take me with him?"       

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:22.162
    - That's what she wants.    
         - No, it isn't!        

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:23.230
             [sighs]            

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.732
   You know the pain she's in.  

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:29.169
   And the cancer's just gonna  
       grow inside of her       

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:31.005
 and just keep fuckin' growing. 

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.675
   You really want to sit back  
   and watch her die in agony?  

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.579
 And wither away... to nothin'? 

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:42.984
 No, it's the most humane thing.
       It's the only way.       

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:47.588
         And besides...         

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:52.492
it wasn't even really Rodger who
 was taking the house from us.  

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.662
     It was Mum. It was Mum!    

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:55.930
       I mean, she was the      
        one that changed        

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:58.198
        the will to suit        
         him and not us.        

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:01.435
   Don't you fucking say that!  
     Don't you fucking dare!    

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:04.605
       Hey. You don't hit       
        your big brother.       

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.941
    Especially when he's got    
   a fuckin' gun in his hand.   

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.779
 How's Sydney this time of year?

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:18.285
             Mum...             

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:19.586
   You shut your mouth, Terry.  
             I want             

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.955
         to hear it from        
          your brother.         

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:26.727
  Did you have a good weekend,  
          Jeffrey? Hey?         

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:29.129
     Did you see everything     
        you wanted? Hey?        

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:32.099
 Opera House and the Domain, eh?

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:34.568
  Or did you do something else  
          this weekend?         

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:37.137
  Something... closer to home?  

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.741
         Calm down, Mum.        
  You're not thinking straight. 

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:42.710
            You boys.           

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.145
         You've got your        
       father's weakness.       

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.046
              Mum--             

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:49.317
Oh! If he could see you two now.

01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:50.751
          Shut up, Mum.         

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:52.486
       You've always been       
        a disappointment        

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.322
       to me, son. I want       
        you to know that.       

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.491
          Mum... don't.         

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.995
    Oh! What are you gonna do   
       with his gun, Jeff?      

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:03.097
    Eh? What are you gonna do   
     with your daddy's gun?     

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:04.465
              Mum--             

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.503
    He liked to paint himself   
 as some kind of war hero. Hey? 

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.338
      The only time he put      
        that gun to good        

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:14.174
         use was when he        
      turned it on himself!     

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:15.510
   You shut the fuck up, Mum.   

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.754
          Jeff. Don't.          

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.993
     Oooh! And there it is.     

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.928
       Take a look at it.       

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:38.132
       All pumped up with       
       a gun in its hand.       

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.033
      Stop it, Mum. Please.     

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:42.537
         - You shut up.         
    - Don't say that to him.    

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:48.876
         Your father was        
       rotten to the core.      

01:15:48.945 --> 01:15:51.779
  And you are half the man he-- 

01:15:57.019 --> 01:16:02.456
     What dirty fuckin' dogs    
   you both turned out to be!

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:42.229
     You're seeing the world    
        differently now.        

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.633
    You're no better than me.   

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.402
    You know that, don't you?   

01:21:49.972 --> 01:21:52.239
     I didn't bring you here    
     kicking and screaming.     

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.408
   You knew the fuckin' plan.   

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:56.343
           You helped.          

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.479
            I agree.            

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:00.681
      You're <i> worse</i> than me.     

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.083
        I know what I am.       

01:22:04.053 --> 01:22:05.586
      I don't lie to myself     
         the way you do.        

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:10.090
     In fact, if you weren't    
  such a weak piece of piss...  

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.261
 we could have been riding away 
      on our bikes by now.      

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:17.331
  Oh, I don't know about that.  

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.501
              Yeah.             

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.103
       Maybe you're right.      

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:26.273
    You're left-handed, yeah?   

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:28.575
              Yep.              

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.112
          [Jeff sighs]          

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:34.581
   - It's not too late, Jeff.   
           - Oh, Tez.           

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:37.618
   I'm pretty sure this is the  
  definition of too late, mate. 

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:40.753

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:44.758
        Well, now we know       
         where we stand.        

01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:46.627
       - [bullets tinkle]

     We've got to go, mate.     

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.575
 Or we're both gonna be fucked. 

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:52.912
    Hey, the... the horse guy   
    will be here soon, mate.    

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.449
   I don't know what the hell   
  they were thinking... [pants] 

01:25:56.819 --> 01:26:00.620
    ...trying to put Freddie    
 in a fuckin' float in the dark.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:04.224
    [chuckles] Someone wasn't   
    thinking straight, mate.    

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:11.832
             Terry.             

01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:14.301
   I know how you feel, mate.

     you've bunged me arm up    
     pretty bad. [chuckles]     

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.442
    How about we just call it   
       even Stevens, huh?

             Tez...

          Mate, I w...          

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.686
    wouldn't try and hurt you   
        on purpose, mate.       

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:36.256
    Not unless... not unless    
      I had a good reason.      

01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:43.197

 So, what makes you the one who 
  decides I should fuckin' die? 

01:27:09.525 --> 01:27:11.792
    'Cause you're a heartless   
         bastard, Jeff.         

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.795
   And I'm fuckin' sick of it.  

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:18.565

   So, what, are you gonna...   
 are you just gonna stand there 

01:27:35.884 --> 01:27:38.585

          [Jeff pants]          

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:16.623
        We're not walking       
         away from this.        

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.294
          Fair enough.          

01:28:21.363 --> 01:28:22.963
       Fair enough, Terry.      

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:27.968
    But I can't do it, mate.    

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:29.970
        I can't do jail.        

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:32.906
            I can't.            

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:35.475
    If it ends, it ends now.    

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:39.313
   The way we re... rehearsed.

        Like the Romans.        

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:54.894
    We didn't rehearse that.    

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:56.330
            But here.           

01:28:57.266 --> 01:28:58.899
       Knock yourself out.

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:33.367
 Romans are full of shit, Terry!

01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:36.803
      They're full of shit!

         [gasps, coughs]

    It isn't... quick at all!   

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:44.811
 [Jeff gurgles, tries to speak] 

01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:48.047

              I...              

01:30:13.242 --> 01:30:15.142
        I... remembered.        

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.216
           [Terry] Hi.          

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.952
          You alright?          

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.388
  Oh, you're here for Freddie.  

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:05.459
          - Excuse me?          
      - Freddie, our horse.     

01:31:08.297 --> 01:31:11.231
     Yeah. Do you need me...    
        to call someone?        

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.101
     Yeah, no, that's, um...    

01:31:15.137 --> 01:31:16.803
       That's my brother.       

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:21.073
  Sorry... have you ever owned  
         a horse before?        

01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:22.776
             [boom!]            

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:26.546
      Yeah, I've... I've...     

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.315
  I've had horses all my life.  

01:31:29.384 --> 01:31:30.750
           Oh, great.           

01:31:30.786 --> 01:31:33.819
     But he's... he's gonna     
       be for my daughter.      

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:34.821
            Oh, good.           

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:37.057
     I got a couple of boys.    

01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:39.960
        Freddie's... he's       
     really good with kids.     

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:41.127
              Good.             

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:44.231
   Sorry, you're not gonna...   

01:31:44.266 --> 01:31:46.266
        you're not gonna        
       agist Freddie in a       

01:31:46.301 --> 01:31:48.101
         paddock and let        
        him rot, are you?       

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:49.435
               No.              

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:51.838
 No, he'll... be looked after...

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:53.640
              well.             

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.908
             Great.             

01:31:55.944 --> 01:31:59.312
  Freddie's actually very shy,  
        so you should...        

01:31:59.348 --> 01:32:01.081
         you should tell        
        your daughter he        

01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:03.750
       really likes to be       
       rubbed on the nose.
