05:24.040 --> 05:27.279
Er, all of his appointments are in
the diary, but do remind him

05:27.280 --> 05:29.639
because he tends to get
a bit in the zone.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.519
So he'll be annoyed
if he misses one.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.359

05:33.360 --> 05:35.079
I have shown him
how to make payments,

05:35.080 --> 05:37.119
because he usually doesn't trust
temps to do it,

05:37.120 --> 05:38.799
but I don't think he'll get
the hang of it.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.159

21:16.960 --> 21:19.079
Georgia Cohen, she's a collector.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.479
Do you know where I can get
a leaflet? Yes. Yes, yeah.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.519
I have a spare for you. And that
would be fantastic, by the way.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.959
Brilliant. I'm just going to run
to the loo, but I'll be right back.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.410
It was lovely to meet you.
Lovely to meet you. OK.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.879
Thank you. Who was that?

21:33.880 --> 21:37.719
She's a friend of a friend,
but she's great.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.999
Sasha Miles.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.479
AUDIO: The contemporary art scene
in Japan is just really thriving.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.999
People see it as a closed ecosystem
but that is just not true any more.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.519
I always say it's an incredibly
exciting time to be in Tokyo

21:53.520 --> 21:56.639
if you are in the contemporary
art world…

21:56.640 --> 21:58.639
AUDIO FADES IN AND OUT

21:58.640 --> 22:01.519
I mean, obviously, the Tate have
done some major retrospectives

22:01.520 --> 22:03.680
in the last few years, but…

22:13.680 --> 22:16.160
HISSING

22:23.720 --> 22:26.639
Hey, Lucas. How are you?
Good. Are you here for a swim?

22:26.640 --> 22:28.759
Yes, I am. No worries, go on in
and I'll log you in.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.439
Do you want to open his membership?
Name, Lucas.

22:31.440 --> 22:35.439
And then you want to type in his
number, which is 25756. OK? Two…

22:35.440 --> 22:37.999
…5756. You got that? Yeah.
No worries.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.040
I'm going to nip to the loo.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.359
Hi, can I sign in for yoga?
Oh, erm, yeah.

22:46.360 --> 22:51.399
Erm, can I get your name and your
membership number?

22:51.400 --> 22:56.159
Maria Peel. 0170956031.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.559
Sorry, 03… One. 031.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.119
And can I see…
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.639
Do you mind if I head in now?
Oh, yeah. Yeah? Thank you.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.640
Of course, that's fine.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.800
And exhale through the mouth.

23:16.680 --> 23:20.560
Be here in the present,
extending your legs…

23:21.920 --> 23:25.719
…and roll down onto your backs,

23:25.720 --> 23:28.159
vertebra by vertebra.

23:28.160 --> 23:32.439
Cactus your arms and
into your spinal twist.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.639
Take a moment
away from your to-do lists…

23:34.640 --> 23:36.640
INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE FADES

23:38.400 --> 23:40.359
See you next week. Bye. Bye.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.880
CHATTER

23:47.600 --> 23:51.239
Sorry, have we… We've met, haven't
we? Yeah. I was thinking that.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.839
Where? You were at my opening.

23:53.840 --> 23:58.959
But we only met in passing
through Michael Hapley. Yes! Yes.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.359
Sorry, what's your name again?
Sasha. Sasha, yes. Yes.

24:02.360 --> 24:06.199
Gorgeous name. Oh, thank you.
I'm so sorry, I can't remember…

24:06.200 --> 24:08.639
Oh, I'm Livia. Sorry. Oh, sorry.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.999
Are you… Shall we? Yes. Yes.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.839
I haven't seen you here before.
Have you just joined?

24:13.840 --> 24:16.519
I've just moved, actually.
I've been living abroad.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.399
Don't tell anyone but my friend
gave me her membership number.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.959
Oh! No, I'm thinking of joining,
I just… Mm.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.439
I just wanted to check it out first.
Yeah, you criminal.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.999
Yeah, well, you should have seen me
trembling on reception.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.479
I can't lie to save my life.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.359
Five years in Tokyo. I got back six
months ago. Oh, nice. Yeah.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.479
I was working in marketing
for a contemporary art gallery.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.919
And then my mum got sick so I came
back. I'm sorry. That's…

24:40.920 --> 24:42.719
Thank you. Yeah.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.759
So, anyway, I had to take
a bog-standard corporate

24:45.760 --> 24:48.479
marketing job while I settled in
and now I'm just kind of using it

24:48.480 --> 24:51.679
as an opportunity to rethink things.
Career-wise, you mean? Yeah.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.999
Yeah. Yeah. I think
I need something more challenging.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.119
I've been thinking about events.
No way. That's what I do.

24:57.120 --> 25:00.679
I thought you worked for the
gallery? No. I'm in PR and events.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.839
I organised the opening. Seriously?
That's so funny. Yeah.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.999
Who do you work for? Myself.
Amazing.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.639
Yeah, I mean, the parties are fun
but there is always high levels

25:09.640 --> 25:12.879
of stress, clients constantly
chucking their toys out the pram.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.519
Actually, sounds like my dream job
description. Oh!

25:15.520 --> 25:17.119
Anyway, I have to head.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.199
It was really nice to see you again.
Yeah. I'm sure I'll see you soon.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.640
OK. All right. Bye-bye. Bye.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.320

25:57.800 --> 25:59.640
Oh, shit.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.160
Shit!

26:04.240 --> 26:06.399
Ah, that doesn't look good.
Fuck!

26:06.400 --> 26:10.239
No, and the baby-sitter leaves in
half an hour. Do you have a spare?

26:10.240 --> 26:13.119
Do you want a hand? No, I don't.
Fuck! Let me just call…

26:13.120 --> 26:15.799
Let me call Louise and see
if she can stay for another hour.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.679
Erm, well, no. Don't worry.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.879
Why don't you call the garage now,
get a taxi back to yours

26:21.880 --> 26:23.839
and I'll wait with the car?

26:23.840 --> 26:26.839
Really? You would do that? Yeah.

26:26.840 --> 26:30.879
I was only going to go home and eat
tortellini in front of RuPaul.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.840
Well, why don't you come to
mine for dinner once your done?

26:51.760 --> 26:55.119
You saved the day, really.
No, don't be silly. It was nothing.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.759
Well, it's more than most people
would do. Thanks so much.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.880
Now, look, eat, please. Tuck in.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.199
Hello! Hey. Hi, love.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.639
This is Sasha.
Ah, yes. The hero.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.879
Ha-ha. Nice to meet you.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.839
I'm actually glad that you
two get to meet

27:19.840 --> 27:21.879
because Sasha has just come back
from Tokyo.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.759
She was working for an art gallery
there. Oh, wow. How was that?

27:24.760 --> 27:28.119
Yeah, it was great. It's a
really exciting scene, actually.

27:28.120 --> 27:31.039
People think of it as a closed
ecosystem or whatever

27:31.040 --> 27:34.039
but that's just not true any more.
Amazing.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.479
Oh, and Sash is friends with
Georgia Cohen. Georgia…

27:37.480 --> 27:39.999
You know, the collector.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.519
Phil doesn't know who anyone is.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.999
Ha-ha! Literally, no-one.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.239
We should get her to see your work.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.799
Oh, are you an artist?
Well, not really, I… What medium?

27:50.800 --> 27:55.639
I paint, mostly oils, which
I know is very old-fashioned, but…

27:55.640 --> 27:57.680
Could I see your work?

27:59.680 --> 28:01.480
It's stunning.

28:02.920 --> 28:03.960
Well, anyway…

28:05.480 --> 28:07.839
There you go. No, really.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.680
The thick impasto.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.160
It's so expressive.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.159
Oh!

28:15.160 --> 28:16.399
Thanks.

28:16.400 --> 28:20.639
Yeah, I've been experimenting
with it a lot recently.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.999
Do you ever exhibit? I used to.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.679
Yeah, then the kids came along

28:25.680 --> 28:28.439
and now I'm an architect who paints
at the weekends.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.799
Do you sell them?
My stuff isn't trendy.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.920
People need to be told
what's trendy.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.999
DISTANT SHOUT: Daddy! Ah!

28:40.000 --> 28:43.399
The…beast has awakened.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.319
FOOTSTEPS

28:48.320 --> 28:50.919
I can't see! Did you flatter him?

28:50.920 --> 28:53.799
Because I don't care whether you
actually like the paintings

28:53.800 --> 28:55.679
or not, but please tell me
you flattered him.

28:55.680 --> 28:59.359
Erm, I did, and it was totally
genuine. He's really talented.

28:59.360 --> 29:02.679
Well, I think so.
He's terrible at self-promotion.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.559
Would you like some tea? Yeah, sure.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.960
MUFFLED SPEECH AND FOOTSTEPS

29:16.960 --> 29:19.719
These are great. Mm.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.600
MUFFLED PLAYFUL SQUEALS

29:24.160 --> 29:27.279
Oh, my God. He is adorable.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.840
Yes. My, er…

29:30.360 --> 29:34.239
My little monster. There you go.
Thank you.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.280
Who's this?

29:38.160 --> 29:40.200
A very good friend.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.919
She actually died recently.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.320
So sorry.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.640
How did it happen?

29:54.680 --> 29:56.800
Suicide.

30:05.080 --> 30:09.839
How? Erm, she was
found on the coast by the cliffs.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.560
Her parents live out there.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.360
Are you OK?

30:23.960 --> 30:25.200
SILENTLY: Sorry.

30:27.800 --> 30:31.559
I… I lost a friend that way too.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.280
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.480
Did you… Did you see it coming?

30:45.120 --> 30:49.399
Well, I guess the signs were there
but somehow I just didn't really…

30:49.400 --> 30:51.850
It's only after that you realise
there were signs.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.560
STIFLED SOB

THUDDING FOOTSTEPS

31:01.360 --> 31:03.359

Erm, let's get you home,
shall we? Yeah.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.439
DISTORTED: God, what a loser.
She was so wrong.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.279
Like, everything about her.

31:27.280 --> 31:30.879
And she kept trying to bond with me.
She was talking to me about impasto.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.079
What? And I was like,

31:32.080 --> 31:34.959
"I'm sorry, do you know what
you're talking about?"

31:34.960 --> 31:36.880
THEY LAUGH

31:38.720 --> 31:41.559
Thank you so much for dinner.
Oh, God, no.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.439
It should be me that's thanking you.

31:43.440 --> 31:47.559
Listen, why don't you come to the
spa with me? The one at Berkeley's?

31:47.560 --> 31:50.519
It might help you make your mind
up about membership.

31:50.520 --> 31:55.279
How about Saturday? I'm seeing a
friend on Saturday. Oh, sure. Sorry.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.479
That would have been lovely.
Another time.

31:58.480 --> 32:02.360
OK, well, take care. OK.
Thank you. Bye.

33:24.440 --> 33:26.759

34:19.080 --> 34:23.319
I mean, I saw a few people since
I've got back but I don't know.

34:23.320 --> 34:27.359
I'm just very picky, I think.
OK. Who can I introduce you to?

34:27.360 --> 34:31.439
Oh, no, please. Oh, God. You're one
of those. Resistant to matchmaking.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.999
No. It's never right
and then it's just awkward.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.119
Yeah, but that's
because I wasn't the matchmaker.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.519
Everyone else is very bad at it.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.959
Loved it. Yeah, it was lovely,
wasn't it?

34:41.960 --> 34:44.119
I'm so… You feel relaxed? …zen!

34:44.120 --> 34:47.119
Me too. Do you want a cup of coffee
before we go? I think I need one.

34:47.120 --> 34:50.239
Great. Oh, hi. Hey.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.559
Hey, Josh. It's been a while.
Mm! Yes.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.919
Polly Matthew's birthday a few
months ago.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.119
Yes, with those very strange
sausage rolls.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.519
God, I still get nightmares.
Do you? Yes!

34:59.520 --> 35:01.120
This is Sasha, by the way.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.679
Sasha. Yeah, yeah. I know Sasha.

35:05.680 --> 35:09.439
I was worried.
I woke up and you were gone.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.679
Oh. Well, Sasha, that's very rude.
She is very rude. I know. Sorry.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.879
I had an early morning.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.639
Well, hey, that's fine.
I understand.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.840
Why don't I give you my number? Huh?

35:22.360 --> 35:25.000
OK. All right.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.879
And you…

35:31.880 --> 35:33.959
…give me a call.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.879
It's lovely to see you again,
Helena. Oh, Josh.

35:36.880 --> 35:39.759
For God's sake. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. You just…

35:39.760 --> 35:43.079
You just really remind me
of a friend of mine named Helena.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.199
That's fine. It's fine.
Erm, shall we get our coffees?

35:46.200 --> 35:48.719
Actually, do you know, I need to go
to the loo but could you grab us

35:48.720 --> 35:50.319
two lattes and I'll see you
by the car?

35:50.320 --> 35:54.200
OK. Great. Nice to see you again.
Good to see you again. Bye. Yeah.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.640
Huh.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.359
So, you like to give false
names at parties?

36:03.360 --> 36:06.880
Sorry, I was just having fun.
Yeah, obviously.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.119
So which one is your real name?
Sasha. Can we stop playing games?

36:11.120 --> 36:13.599
Hey, you're the one playing games.
I'm just trying to keep up.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.999
What can I get you?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.319
Erm, can I get two lattes, please?

36:17.320 --> 36:20.000
Josh, what do YOU want?
I'm fine, thank you. OK.

36:22.680 --> 36:27.120
I said I'm sorry. It's just really
hard to trust anything you say now.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.800
Becky Green?

36:32.360 --> 36:33.960
Wow!

36:44.560 --> 36:47.119
Josh, that wasn't my card, OK?
The card down there.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.439
That wasn't my card. Whoa, whoa!
That's why it said that.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.400
OK. It's fine, it's fine.
Because it was my friend's.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.039
What is going on?
Nothing. Nothing's going on.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.639
I've just borrowed my friend's card.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.080
I don't believe anything
you just said, OK?

37:03.880 --> 37:05.520
Come on.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.520
Huh?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.960
I… I go by Sasha.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.560
I just… I just like to decide
how people see me.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.880
OK.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.440
WHISPERING: Now back off!

38:00.520 --> 38:03.839
Hi. Thanks so much. Thanks, great.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.719
So, what's your address?

38:05.720 --> 38:07.199
Oh, don't worry.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.879
You can drop me at the museum where
you picked me up from this morning.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.079
I could do with a walk.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.039
No, I need to go to the farm shop
in Montpellier. I'm having friends

38:14.040 --> 38:16.319
over for dinner. Oh.
Yeah, so what's your address?

38:16.320 --> 38:21.319
I'm, erm…
I'm on Brennan Street. Oh, perfect.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.399
You really are picky, aren't you?

38:23.400 --> 38:25.840
Huh? I mean, he's hot AND funny.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.959
Is he a good friend of yours?

38:28.960 --> 38:31.959
No, not really but, you know, I see
him around. I like him, actually.

38:31.960 --> 38:35.359
You know he's in the same
field as you? No. Yeah.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.839
He's like a creative director,
curator or something, from New York.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.919
He actually moved to London
to work for the Tate

38:40.920 --> 38:42.999
and the Harbourside Gallery
here snapped him up.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.919
Don't tell me he's not perfect
for you.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.039
You know, there's playing
hard to get

38:47.040 --> 38:49.239
and then
there's just being annoying.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.279
Call him.

38:51.280 --> 38:55.599
Ah. OK, OK. I will.
No, call him now. Arrange a date.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.999
What? Dude, we are not leaving
until you've called him. Call him!

38:59.000 --> 39:02.720
OK. Call him. Christ.

No, no. It's fine.

Sorry about that. No, no worries.
I hope you had a good time. I did.

Oh, my God. Amazing. Well, look.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.959
So how do you know Liv?

43:05.960 --> 43:09.759
Uh, we're yoga friends,
rapidly becoming real-life friends.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.839
I always thought yoga friends were
a step above real-life friends.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.279
Yes, definitely.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.879
Once you've done downward dog with
someone there's no going back.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.919
And what do you do?
Sorry, such a boring question.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.879
No, no, that's fine. That's fine.

43:23.880 --> 43:26.959
I've just got back from Japan,
actually, I was over there doing

43:26.960 --> 43:29.399
marketing for a
contemporary art gallery.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.519
Wow. That didn't even have
a boring answer.

43:32.520 --> 43:35.040
What about you, what do you do?

43:36.160 --> 43:40.199
We started a social enterprise
banking app, me and Elliot.

43:40.200 --> 43:44.119
I was working in financial services
for this big depressing company

43:44.120 --> 43:46.719
and getting disillusioned
with the fact that they were all

43:46.720 --> 43:48.159
totally inefficient dinosaurs.

43:48.160 --> 43:51.279
Nish had this brilliant idea and was
mad enough to team up with me, so…

43:51.280 --> 43:54.400
I'd never have done it without him.
So inspiring.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.759
What about you, what do you do?

43:57.760 --> 43:59.959
Tara is very multi-talented.

43:59.960 --> 44:04.399
I'm interested in documentary, but I
might also become a songwriter.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.679
Oh, great!

44:06.680 --> 44:09.159
Great! What type of music?

44:09.160 --> 44:10.840
Mostly stuff about heartbreak.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.919
Elliot's also interested
in politics.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.439
Oh, really? Me too.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.559
He's a local councillor.
Oh, wow.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.360
Do you ever think about standing?

44:21.360 --> 44:23.159
Oh, well…

44:23.160 --> 44:24.519
What is it?

44:24.520 --> 44:26.759
It's nothing…
What are you lot talking about?

44:26.760 --> 44:30.039
No, no. Nothing. It's nothing.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.480

44:32.560 --> 44:33.959

44:33.960 --> 44:37.399
OK. It has to stay

44:37.400 --> 44:40.439
I need a bit of advice.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.839
Graham Brannigan…

44:41.840 --> 44:43.559
Our MP. I know!

44:43.560 --> 44:47.639
Well, there's some unsavoury
information that's come to light.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.599
They're trying their best
to keep it under wraps

44:50.600 --> 44:53.320
but if they don't, he's finished.

44:54.440 --> 44:57.479
Well, Mitch, your dad
doesn't want to stand again

44:57.480 --> 45:00.279
and they've asked me
if I'd consider it.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.679
And there seems to be a lot
of support so…

45:02.680 --> 45:05.720
Shit the bed, are you serious?
I mean, this is huge.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.720
It's, erm…

45:12.400 --> 45:14.680
It's too soon. Of course.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.000
Yeah, of course.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.480
Too soon for what?

45:24.960 --> 45:26.640
SCORNFUL LAUGHTER

45:28.040 --> 45:29.320
His wife died.

45:30.600 --> 45:31.800
Oh.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.600
El, this might actually
be what you need.

45:40.120 --> 45:41.359
I don't know.

45:41.360 --> 45:43.559
Look, if it doesn't feel right,
it doesn't feel right.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.319
Oh, mate.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.319
She would have been so proud of you.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.279
This is what she would have wanted.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.079

HE CLEARS THROAT

45:53.880 --> 45:55.319
No, I'm not really…

45:55.320 --> 45:57.719
No, right. So what's the matter?

45:57.720 --> 45:59.720
This is f…

46:01.680 --> 46:05.559
Can you imagine when we were
younger, this happening?

46:05.560 --> 46:07.359
What the fuck are you even
talking about?

46:07.360 --> 46:09.399
One of us has died and we're here,

46:09.400 --> 46:12.479
we're just eating food,
we're talking about work.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.039
As if nothing has changed.
It's a fucking joke.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.319
Richard. Why are they here?

46:16.320 --> 46:18.239
Why are we having dinner
with two strangers?

46:18.240 --> 46:20.239
Shut the fuck up, Rich.
Who are you?

46:20.240 --> 46:22.519
Who are you as well,
cos I know your face? Richard!

46:22.520 --> 46:26.199
You know, the fucking truth is
that we didn't know her, cos if we

46:26.200 --> 46:29.559
had we would have stopped her
and that's why she's dead.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.159
Because we weren't fucking there.

46:31.160 --> 46:34.399
Fuck you, Rich.
We fucked up. Where were we?

46:34.400 --> 46:36.999
Where were we? Huh?
Where the fuck were we?

46:37.000 --> 46:38.400
Richard, that is enough!

46:42.280 --> 46:44.160
Now, can you pull yourself together?

46:45.400 --> 46:46.600
QUIETLY: Yeah.

46:53.040 --> 46:56.799
I'm so sorry, Sasha and Tara.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.759
I think I might go.
No, stay, stay.

46:59.760 --> 47:01.480
Stay. Erm…

47:03.600 --> 47:05.959

47:43.840 --> 47:45.200
For all of us.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.440
I was completely blindsided
by my friend.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.600
What was her name? Alex.

47:56.400 --> 47:59.720
I just thought I knew
what her life was. Hm.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.880
I was just completely wrong.

48:09.160 --> 48:11.120
You know, on the night she died…

48:15.560 --> 48:18.240
…she posted this quote on her page.

48:20.920 --> 48:23.400
Sends chills down my spine
reading it.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.840
What, what was the quote?

48:29.920 --> 48:31.600
"To die by your side."

48:33.680 --> 48:35.840
Is that…that's The Smiths. Yeah.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.980
It's pretty weird, I don't think
she even listened to them.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.080
Who was the "you"?

48:50.280 --> 48:51.840
I have no idea.

48:55.480 --> 48:57.879

Hey.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.839
Thank you so much for staying.

49:05.840 --> 49:09.519
I think if El gets elected I'm
going to be doing his PR and events.

49:09.520 --> 49:12.279
Wow. Yeah, so there'll probably
be some opportunities.

49:12.280 --> 49:14.759
Oh, amazing. Yeah, that's amazing.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.199
Yeah. So get home safe. OK.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.119

about the exhibition.

49:19.120 --> 49:22.239
