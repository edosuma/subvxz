00:01.320 --> 00:04.839
Anyone watching, thinking we know
fuck all about knowing

00:04.840 --> 00:08.359
fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:08.360 --> 00:12.359
So you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk, sending prices

00:12.440 --> 00:16.439
sky-high, literally, literally,
taking the grass from its own roots.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.959
Now you've got your ConDemNation...

00:19.960 --> 00:23.359
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.360 --> 00:27.359
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.519
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:31.520 --> 00:33.599
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.600 --> 00:36.879
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.879
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:39.880 --> 00:43.879
and they charge us for water!

00:44.080 --> 00:48.079
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.239
This green and pleasant
land in ancient times...

00:52.240 --> 00:54.239
Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak!

00:54.240 --> 00:57.519
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.039
This is our England now.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.039
Paaaarty!

01:05.239 --> 01:09.439
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:11.120 --> 01:14.079
I blame all those fat, short-haired,

01:14.080 --> 01:17.479
hairy bints who took a match
to their bras in the 60s.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.799
It's them feminists we've got to
thank for the way society looks

01:20.800 --> 01:24.639
down on anyone who stays at home
looking after the house and kids.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.239
People just don't
see our true value.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.239
We work 24 hours a day, seven days
a week for no pay or holidays.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.479
What we do isn't seen as work.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.359
You're only valued if you're
actually bringing in money.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.799
Don't even get so much
as a thank you.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.759
I just wish those mardy-arsed
lezzas had kept their saggy,

01:46.760 --> 01:49.999
old tits in their Double Ds!

01:50.000 --> 01:53.999
You want to get to bed
a bit earlier.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.719
Morning.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.759
I'll come back.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.879
No, you won't. Sit your arse down.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.679
You had breakfast?

02:00.680 --> 02:01.999
Just some toast.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.999
Bung a few eggs in the pan for Carl.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.318
What've we got on today?

02:08.320 --> 02:11.079
I need you to pull in all
outstanding debts.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.039
Cash flow problem.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.359
And shift that lot.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.559
And you're going to help.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.679
I need you back on the rounds now
Shane's doing his own thing.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.519
Your little holiday's over.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.119
It's time you started
pulling your weight again.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.279
And what about Cilla?

02:26.280 --> 02:30.279
She sleeps most of the day.
You'll be fine.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.919
There you go.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.919
And for you.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.760 --> 02:53.199
Noooooooo!

02:53.200 --> 02:57.199
They are full of salt!

03:20.720 --> 03:23.239
I thought you were
having your hair done.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.759
She's off sick. What the hell
are you doing in my dress?

03:26.760 --> 03:30.199
Just giving it an airing. Besides,
you've no need for it any longer.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.799
What do you mean?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.639
He's not exactly
rushing to set a new date.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.719
I reckon he's just
stringing you along.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.999
Just take it off.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.479
You need to stop this
ridiculous daydreaming.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.159
It's no daydream.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.239
You think I'm going to spend
the rest of my days

03:45.240 --> 03:47.959
sleeping in the corner
of a bloody living room?

03:47.960 --> 03:51.959
Just where do you think
you're going to bag yourself a man?

03:53.040 --> 03:55.719
South Manchester Befrienders,
we're listening.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.879
Not a problem, you can ring us
any time. Bye-bye.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.759
Yes, course you can.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.759
'It'll be my second baby.'

04:02.760 --> 04:03.799
And how old are you?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.959
'I'm 18 next week.'

04:08.560 --> 04:10.119
Hello.'Hello?

04:10.120 --> 04:13.559
'I don't think I can carry on...'

04:13.560 --> 04:15.759
'Aye, and I'll be 60 next week.'

04:15.760 --> 04:18.519
That sounds like you have
a lot on your plate.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.999
Why don't we meet up
and you can tell me more about it.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.079
Look, it's always better to talk
about your problems face to face.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.439
Oh, I live near there.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.439
Why don't we continue this
conversation over a cuppa?

04:56.040 --> 04:57.519
When's tea?

04:57.520 --> 05:01.519
I'll do it when I've finished
reading this.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.399
Look, you're three weeks behind
on your payments.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.319
Look, I know you're in there.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.319
I can hear your telly.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.159
Shit!

05:37.640 --> 05:41.639
Get here, you...

05:48.080 --> 05:52.079
I'll get you!

06:06.960 --> 06:10.959
You should go from happy hour
to happy day.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.999
Are we getting married?

06:15.560 --> 06:16.839
Libby, love...

06:16.840 --> 06:20.159
Everyone got pissed, there was a fight -
It's as good as a wedding.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.679
But we weren't blessed.

06:21.680 --> 06:25.279
I've been blessed twice before,
it really doesn't help.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.799
It's not going to make
any difference, is it?

06:27.800 --> 06:31.359
I already see you as me missus.
Karen, can I have another pint?

06:31.360 --> 06:35.359
What do you...

06:35.680 --> 06:38.039
You serious? That's all you took?

06:38.040 --> 06:40.959
Well, it's been a bit difficult,
you know, with Cilla and that.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.199
When your dad was inside,
I ran the business

06:43.200 --> 06:45.839
and looked after the lot of you
when you were kids.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.119
You stuck us in the library all day.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.039
Yeah.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.199
We can't survive on what
we've got coming in.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.439
Sort it.
I am.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.679
I'm trying to think of ways that
I can earn money

06:57.680 --> 07:01.679
and be at home with Cilla
at the same time, but...

07:04.160 --> 07:05.439
What you doing?

07:05.440 --> 07:08.399
Avril's opened my eyes up to
the wonder of the interweb.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.679
We're branching out.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.999
Selling worn knickers.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.239
It bleeding stinks!

07:15.240 --> 07:18.159
How'd you get it to
smell like actual piss?

07:18.160 --> 07:20.319
It is actual piss.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.279
I had to go and buy this because
I kept missing the bloody hole.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.959
Do you know what? I could do with
making a few bob off the internet.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.399
You want to get into kids things,
seem to really sell well.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.759
Sex -now that's something that
you'll always earn money from.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.759
Credit cards. Find a way of getting hold of
people's details and you're onto a winner.

07:48.320 --> 07:51.359
That thing can come down.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.959
What?

07:52.960 --> 07:55.399
You said I'd have blood on my hands
if I didn't put it up.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.479
Make your mind up.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.399
I've handed in my notice.
Waste of bloody time.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.359
Not been as fulfilling
as you'd hoped?

08:02.360 --> 08:03.879
You could say that.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.879
Maybe I've been a little hasty.

08:10.040 --> 08:14.039
Put it back!

08:16.680 --> 08:20.679
Hey, you haven't paid for that!

08:24.080 --> 08:25.639
What the fuck you doing!

08:25.640 --> 08:29.639
You're no better than a rapist.
Encouraging men to objectify women.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.999
Hear, hear!

08:33.000 --> 08:34.159
What's your problem?

08:34.159 --> 08:36.919
Some little scrote's been
mouthing off, going on at me

08:36.919 --> 08:38.078
to show him my tits.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.279
He can get in the queue.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.679
Might've guessed you'd be supportive
and understanding.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.318
You can't just shove 'em out
whenever it suits you.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.639
What?

08:44.640 --> 08:46.079
You're always giving blokes the
come-on when you're after something.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.039
No, I'm not!

08:48.040 --> 08:52.039
So, do I get any discount?

08:53.880 --> 08:57.599
That's just me being friendly.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.919
I'm looking for investment
in my internet venture.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.919
In return, I'm prepared to offer
10% equity in the new business.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.159
The type of ground-breaking website
I'm proposing

09:13.160 --> 09:16.959
has very low expenditure
for extremely high returns.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.719
It has the potential to produce
a constant revenue stream

09:20.720 --> 09:27.559
and I project gross profits of
200,000 over a three-year period.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.559
So, onto our target market.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.719
Kiddie fiddlers.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.519
I propose to launch a child porn
website that won't actually

09:39.520 --> 09:41.839
contain any sick pictures.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.799
The home page will lure our consumer
to subscribe to what

09:45.800 --> 09:47.519
they think will be jack-off heaven.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.839
But while they're
waiting for the site to download,

09:49.840 --> 09:51.799
we'll be ripping their
credit card details.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.759
And by the time they've
discovered it's a scam,

09:53.760 --> 09:57.359
we'll have run up the largest bill
that the nonces have ever seen.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.919
And we'll actually be
doing society a favour,

09:59.920 --> 10:02.279
because the website will
act as a deterrent.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.279
You know, make them nervous about
subscribing to other pervy sites.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.559
So, any questions?

10:12.080 --> 10:15.119
Yeah, just one major problem.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.359
You forgot to mention
it's totally illegal

10:17.360 --> 10:19.799
and that you could get sent down
if someone grassed.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.799
Who's going to admit they've
joined a child porn website?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.302
I'm in!

10:35.680 --> 10:37.839
Loosen your tie a bit more.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.839
He could do with looking younger.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.519
Right, get up there.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.199
What you doing?

10:48.200 --> 10:52.199
Don't worry, you'll be able to
afford 20 new pairs.

10:58.360 --> 11:02.359
Finished!

11:03.680 --> 11:07.479
I now pronounce this website
open for business!

11:07.480 --> 11:08.799
Yes!

11:08.800 --> 11:10.679
What's going on?

11:10.680 --> 11:11.719
We're going live!

11:11.720 --> 11:13.999
Come and have a look!

11:14.000 --> 11:17.999
Yeah!

11:49.680 --> 11:52.039
Come on!

11:52.040 --> 11:56.039
Should've stuck a bag on his head.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.719
Sod this, I'm off to bed.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.039
Yes!

12:12.040 --> 12:16.039
You mean, there's a perv there now,
at the other end?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.999
I'm going to find you and blow your
balls off, you sick fucker! Grrr!

12:24.000 --> 12:27.999
Quick! Transfer the money
into our account.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.599
What we going to buy?!

12:29.600 --> 12:31.039
Book us a week in Alicante!

12:31.040 --> 12:32.443
Ha-ha!

12:59.623 --> 13:03.262
Whoa! 'Kin' hell!
What you trying to do to me, woman?

13:03.263 --> 13:04.742
Oh.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.542
Must've bobbed off.

13:06.543 --> 13:07.822
What the hell you doing in that box?

13:07.823 --> 13:09.342
What the hell you doing in that box?
Checking what size it is.

13:09.343 --> 13:11.262
I'm flogging 'em.

13:11.263 --> 13:13.702
Earn 50 quid
for every one I shift.

13:13.703 --> 13:16.622
How the hell are you going to find
enough people on the cusp of death?

13:16.623 --> 13:17.942
Oh.

13:18.983 --> 13:21.742
What? What? What?

13:21.743 --> 13:23.062
Give it.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.022
G... Bastard.

13:25.023 --> 13:28.302
The helpline
are diverting calls here.

13:28.303 --> 13:31.502
I don't want to lose any business.

13:33.103 --> 13:37.022
Yes. I am sorry to hear
about your husband.

13:37.023 --> 13:41.022
I expect you're thinking
of following him to the other side.

13:46.503 --> 13:50.022
We can flog all this lot, and
I've transferred a stack of money.

13:50.023 --> 13:51.462
Become a right little
Richard Branson, hasn't he?

13:51.463 --> 13:52.742
Nice one, Micky.

13:52.743 --> 13:56.742
It needs to be manned 24/7, though,
so I've drawn up a little rota.

13:57.023 --> 14:01.022
Erm. There y'are.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.742
I've got school.

14:05.743 --> 14:08.222
Well, do you want to miss out
on any business?

14:08.223 --> 14:10.302
I thought we could set up
a few more sites.

14:10.303 --> 14:13.542
Stick this on, I'll take some pics.
We can do this one next.

14:13.543 --> 14:17.062
No way.

14:17.063 --> 14:21.062
There y'are.

14:25.703 --> 14:29.142
Not forgetting you.

14:29.143 --> 14:30.462
What's this?!

14:30.463 --> 14:32.222
Your cut.

14:32.223 --> 14:33.542
You taking me for a mug?

14:33.543 --> 14:34.542
What's your problem?

14:34.543 --> 14:36.062
I want the same as yous lot.

14:36.063 --> 14:37.302
Well, you're not a Maguire.

14:37.303 --> 14:39.622
It's my photos
that've been pulling them in.

14:39.623 --> 14:42.742
Yeah, but it was my idea
in the first place.

14:42.743 --> 14:45.662
Well, find someone else
to stick this on.

14:45.663 --> 14:47.742
Fine. You're sacked.

14:47.743 --> 14:50.342
You can't sack me!
I'm a business partner.

14:50.343 --> 14:52.782
Employee. Probably for the best.

14:52.783 --> 14:56.782
Getting a bit too old
for this game.

15:08.623 --> 15:12.622
Why don't you take a picture?
Knobheads.

15:13.183 --> 15:15.782
The youth of today. So charming.

15:15.783 --> 15:18.782
Is that little prick
still gobbing off?

15:18.783 --> 15:22.782
No, it's all sorted.

15:23.343 --> 15:24.662
Do you fancy walking me to the bus?

15:24.663 --> 15:28.662
Yeah, sure.

15:34.743 --> 15:36.982
Do you want to go out one night?
Just you and me.

15:36.983 --> 15:38.542
Yeah, sure.

15:38.543 --> 15:40.702
When you free?

15:40.703 --> 15:42.102
What?

15:42.103 --> 15:43.822
To go out.

15:43.823 --> 15:47.822
Out where?

15:48.663 --> 15:52.662
Who's he? He's not the one
who's been mouthing off, is he?

15:53.063 --> 15:57.062
He looks about ten! Why are you
making such a big deal about it?

15:58.303 --> 16:01.622
That's why you wanted me
to walk you.

16:01.623 --> 16:04.382
Carl!

16:04.383 --> 16:08.382
Hey, love! Show us yer tits!

16:09.743 --> 16:13.702
Oh, there you are.
Can you lend us a...?

16:13.703 --> 16:16.862
Got them for our honeymoon.

16:16.863 --> 16:20.862
Ohh! Stick 'em on, then.

16:31.343 --> 16:34.862
Like what you see?

16:34.863 --> 16:38.862
And I can make these go faster
than helicopter blades.

16:46.703 --> 16:50.022
Well, you going to stick them on,
or what?

16:50.023 --> 16:52.822
On our wedding night or your funeral.

16:52.823 --> 16:56.102
Whichever comes first.

16:56.103 --> 16:58.462
Oh, come on, Lib.
You can't do this to a man!

16:58.463 --> 17:02.462
You know what you've got to do.

17:08.742 --> 17:12.742
What are you looking for?

17:12.863 --> 17:15.942
This.

17:15.943 --> 17:19.942
Just got to knock one out.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.582
Why don't you try that one?

17:23.583 --> 17:25.541
The solid walnut.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.021
If you don't want your family
to know you're a penniless alcoholic.

17:27.022 --> 17:28.702
'Kin' hell!

17:33.343 --> 17:37.342
South Manchester Befrienders.

17:41.863 --> 17:44.302
Can't we stick her on powder?

17:44.303 --> 17:47.142
This contraption's ripping
the bleeding nipples off me.

17:47.143 --> 17:51.142
No! It's been proven - kids raised
on breast milk are higher achievers.

17:52.743 --> 17:54.182
Still raking it in?

17:54.183 --> 17:58.182
No-one's subscribed for ages now.

17:59.663 --> 18:03.662
Pervs must be
tipping each other off.

18:20.423 --> 18:22.742
Hi. I'm really...

18:22.743 --> 18:26.382
I'm sorry to bother you, Micky,
but you're my last resort.

18:26.383 --> 18:28.342
I'm really desperate.

18:28.343 --> 18:32.342
Would you be a gent and loan me the use
of your TV and lounge for five minutes?

18:37.343 --> 18:39.782
Yeah, yeah. Just passing that knob
I was telling you about.

18:39.783 --> 18:41.782
Telling 'em what?

18:41.783 --> 18:45.782
That we're about to take you
to the cleaners. Laters.

18:45.903 --> 18:47.382
Set up a website
with my mates from school.

18:47.383 --> 18:48.662
Micky...

18:48.663 --> 18:52.662
Pictures on there of all of us.
They can't get enough of it.

18:58.543 --> 19:00.942
Yeah, yeah.
The world's gone bloody mad.

19:00.943 --> 19:03.342
Never thought I'd live to see
the day a pair of poofs

19:03.343 --> 19:04.782
could mince down the aisle together.

19:04.783 --> 19:06.182
'They've no shame.'

19:06.183 --> 19:09.902
I've heard they even use
penis-shaped confetti.

19:09.903 --> 19:11.862
'I'm better off out of it.'

19:11.863 --> 19:14.382
Time to shift on to the next life.

19:14.383 --> 19:17.742
Let's hope that place
isn't taken over by bloody Poles.

19:17.743 --> 19:20.982
So, you're contemplating suicide?

19:20.983 --> 19:24.982
No. In the middle
of actually doing it.

19:26.063 --> 19:30.062
Well, have you ever given
your funeral any thought?

19:31.863 --> 19:33.462
You must be Trevor.

19:33.463 --> 19:37.462
I didn't realise you were a cripple, or whatever
word it is I'm meant to use these days.

19:38.383 --> 19:42.302
Cripple's fine. Political correctness
has been this country's downfall.

19:42.303 --> 19:46.302
A woman after me own heart.

19:46.663 --> 19:50.422
Just had a three-mile bus journey
sat next to some window-licker.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.342
I don't know why we did away
with asylums.

19:53.343 --> 19:55.182
My thoughts exactly.

19:55.183 --> 19:57.262
Used to be a cracking day out.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.782
Would you like to try
the pine first?

19:59.783 --> 20:02.342
Stylish, yet affordable.

20:02.343 --> 20:06.342
Shoes!
Oh.

20:13.223 --> 20:16.182
How does it feel?

20:16.183 --> 20:18.302
The lining's making me itch.

20:18.303 --> 20:19.342
You'll be dead, you daft bugger.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.262
Which is the most expensive?

20:22.263 --> 20:25.782
The less that thieving Government get
of mine when I'm gone, the better.

20:25.783 --> 20:27.262
That'll be the mahogany.

20:27.263 --> 20:29.622
So...live here alone?

20:29.623 --> 20:32.302
No!

20:32.303 --> 20:33.862
Oh.
Share with my daughter,

20:33.863 --> 20:37.502
and the rabble
she got herself involved with.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.902
No, er, husband?

20:38.903 --> 20:40.302
God, no!

20:40.303 --> 20:41.702
Ah.

20:41.703 --> 20:43.502
Once bitten...

20:43.503 --> 20:44.862
Which one would you like
to be buried in?

20:44.863 --> 20:48.542
Well...I guess the mahogany.

20:48.543 --> 20:51.662
Oozes class.

20:54.103 --> 20:58.102
We must celebrate.

21:00.863 --> 21:04.862
Where's the stepladders?

21:09.263 --> 21:11.862
Oh, my God - look at that!

21:11.863 --> 21:14.142
No way, look.
Here's one of me in Blackpool.

21:14.143 --> 21:16.822
Who'd have thought
you'd grow up to be such a hunk?

21:16.823 --> 21:20.822
Ah, check out our Jamie
with his dodgy hair!

21:21.103 --> 21:25.102
Perfect. Give it here.

21:33.023 --> 21:37.022
Those pubic hair-dodgers
won't be able to resist you.

21:41.463 --> 21:42.542
Who's idea was that?

21:42.543 --> 21:43.942
Who's idea was that?
Um...

21:43.943 --> 21:47.942
Mine.

21:48.823 --> 21:52.822
Fucking genius!

21:56.623 --> 22:00.342
No, you don't!

22:00.343 --> 22:01.902
Trevor.

22:01.903 --> 22:05.302
I assumed he was a burglar.

22:05.303 --> 22:08.102
See why I don't want
my daughter to marry him?

22:08.103 --> 22:10.862
Needs a bloody good haircut.
Scruffy bugger.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.902
What's she doing with him?
Oh, scared of being alone.

22:14.903 --> 22:18.262
Aren't we all?
I suppose.

22:18.263 --> 22:21.142
If you've got the opportunity
to be with someone,

22:21.143 --> 22:25.142
you should grab it with both hands.

22:27.623 --> 22:31.622
We're supposed to be
celebrating your purchase.

22:38.943 --> 22:41.982
Ah.

22:41.983 --> 22:45.982
Here's to being six feet under.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.302
Oh, it hasn't stopped.
They're mad for us.

22:50.303 --> 22:54.142
It's obviously me that's pulling
'em in, innit? Look - cute as fuck.

22:54.143 --> 22:56.862
Nah,
I reckon it's me they're after.

22:56.863 --> 22:57.862
I mean, who could resist
that little smile?

22:57.863 --> 23:01.262
I'm getting trading standards
onto you.

23:01.263 --> 23:02.302
Do you mind knocking?

23:02.303 --> 23:05.382
Those photos are ancient.
You're a load of fat cunts now.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.342
I am not fat!

23:07.343 --> 23:08.222
You nicked all my business.

23:08.223 --> 23:12.222
And?

23:16.223 --> 23:20.222
Bollocks!

23:27.072 --> 23:28.471
Morning.

23:28.472 --> 23:30.151
Oh!

23:30.152 --> 23:31.791
Couldn't wait to see you.

23:31.792 --> 23:33.631
How did you get in?

23:33.632 --> 23:36.631
Kitchen window was open.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.031
How long've you been there?

23:38.032 --> 23:39.351
Since three.

23:39.352 --> 23:41.671
Couldn't sleep.

23:41.672 --> 23:43.551
Fancy a morning out?

23:43.552 --> 23:47.551
Well...

23:47.672 --> 23:49.111

Usually I have to bride...

24:39.312 --> 24:43.311
bribe, people to push me places.

24:46.152 --> 24:49.071
We're a long time dead.

24:49.072 --> 24:53.071
We should be living life
to the full....taking risks.

24:55.432 --> 24:58.951
There's no need for either of us

24:58.952 --> 25:02.951
ever to be lonely again.

25:04.312 --> 25:08.231
Would you do me the honour of...

25:08.232 --> 25:11.511
..dying with me.

25:11.512 --> 25:12.791
What?!

25:12.792 --> 25:16.791
A suicide pact. It's perfect.
If we let nature take its course,

25:18.232 --> 25:22.231
one of us will be left on this earth
alone for months, maybe even years.

25:22.592 --> 25:25.711
Killing ourselves at the same time

25:25.712 --> 25:28.231
guarantees we leave
exactly the same time.

25:28.232 --> 25:29.831
I'm not ready to die.

25:29.832 --> 25:33.831
Oh, I don't mean now,
we'll get married first.

25:34.712 --> 25:36.591
You want to marry me?

25:36.592 --> 25:40.591
Of course.
Do you want to marry me?

25:41.352 --> 25:42.391
Yes.

25:42.392 --> 25:45.391
Good, I've been in touch
with the registry office,

25:45.392 --> 25:48.271
they've got a cancellation.
This afternoon.

25:48.272 --> 25:50.791
This afternoon?!

25:50.792 --> 25:53.591
Isn't...
Isn't it a bit quick?

25:53.592 --> 25:55.711
Why delay something
that's inevitable.

25:55.712 --> 25:59.711
I knew I wanted you to be my wife
the moment I set eyes on you.

26:15.912 --> 26:19.911
Hiya.

26:20.752 --> 26:24.751
Show us yer tits!

26:35.392 --> 26:36.991
Didn't know it was Halloween.

26:36.992 --> 26:39.911
It's to stop guys just seeing me

26:39.912 --> 26:43.911
as an instrument for
their sexual pleasure.

26:50.072 --> 26:51.591
It's working.

26:51.592 --> 26:53.271
What's he done now?

26:53.272 --> 26:57.071
He just doesn't seem that
bothered about getting married.

26:57.072 --> 26:58.471
What man is?

26:58.472 --> 27:02.471
They know that's when
the blow jobs are going to stop.

27:04.752 --> 27:07.391
Aren't you going to congratulate us.

27:07.392 --> 27:09.151
Married!

27:09.152 --> 27:11.231
I'm moving in to Trevor's.

27:11.232 --> 27:13.431
You're not pregnant are you?

27:13.432 --> 27:15.391
All a bit quick in't it?

27:15.392 --> 27:16.911
What would you like dear?

27:16.912 --> 27:19.911
Dubonnet.

27:19.912 --> 27:21.551
Dubonnet and a lemonade please.

27:21.552 --> 27:22.591
OK.

27:22.592 --> 27:25.551
He's railroaded you
into this, hasn't he?

27:25.552 --> 27:27.351
Yes. And I'm glad he did.

27:27.352 --> 27:29.151
I haven't felt this alive in years.

27:29.152 --> 27:30.671
It's ridiculous.

27:30.672 --> 27:34.231
You're just jealous. I've found
a man who actually wants to commit.

27:34.232 --> 27:37.111
Congratulations!
Who would've thought your own mum

Police Constable World.

29:00.192 --> 29:01.191
What's going on?!

29:01.192 --> 29:02.791
You're all under arrest

29:02.792 --> 29:06.791
for manufacturing and
distributing child pornography.

29:10.432 --> 29:12.391
I better start packing.

29:12.392 --> 29:15.351
I think we're forgetting something.

29:15.352 --> 29:19.351
We need to consummate the marriage.

29:36.792 --> 29:39.991
You can't keep us
locked up any longer!

29:39.992 --> 29:43.551
Got a young baby I need to feed.

29:43.552 --> 29:45.951
I think they can see that.

29:45.952 --> 29:49.951
Your udders need a wipe.

29:51.992 --> 29:54.231
Why the fuck didn't you
delete everything first!?

29:54.232 --> 29:57.271
I couldn't, it wouldn't turn on.

you've got us in?!

29:59.512 --> 30:01.951

30:01.952 --> 30:03.071

Micky, he's a Gallagher.

30:17.792 --> 30:19.231
We'll lose the business.

30:19.232 --> 30:19.871
And the house.

30:19.872 --> 30:20.871
And Cilla.

30:20.872 --> 30:22.231
What?

30:22.232 --> 30:24.951
Well, they're bound to get
social services involved.

30:24.952 --> 30:28.391
Look, all I wanted was to make
sure I was around for Cilla.

30:28.392 --> 30:30.271
I'm not having her
playing second fiddle

30:30.272 --> 30:31.391
to the business like us lot did.

30:31.392 --> 30:33.911
Me and your dad were
always there for you.

30:33.912 --> 30:37.231
You might've been there physically.

30:37.232 --> 30:41.231
I wrote a story for school once,
I was dead proud of it.

30:41.672 --> 30:45.671
You said you'd read it once
you'd done the cashing up.

30:46.232 --> 30:50.231
I sat there all night
waiting for you to finish.

30:50.952 --> 30:52.751
You were too busy in the morning.

30:52.752 --> 30:56.511
I had to hand it in that day.

30:56.512 --> 31:00.511
Well, I'm going to read
every single story Cilla writes.

31:02.032 --> 31:04.391
I'm going to make sure
she has a good future.

31:04.392 --> 31:08.151
I don't want her turning out like me.

31:08.152 --> 31:11.191
Now, they've got nothing on us,

31:11.192 --> 31:15.191
and we'll be walking out of here
in no time.

31:29.432 --> 31:31.671
Show us yer tits!

31:31.672 --> 31:35.071
Ha! Nice!

31:35.072 --> 31:38.071
Ah!

31:38.072 --> 31:42.071
Ah! My leg!

32:08.312 --> 32:12.311
What the fuck are
you dreaming about?

32:16.912 --> 32:18.951
Can't remember.

32:18.952 --> 32:20.791
What's happening?

32:20.792 --> 32:23.591
Child pornography charges
have been dropped.

32:23.592 --> 32:25.391
I fucking told you!

32:25.392 --> 32:29.391
We've been charged with fraud.

32:36.632 --> 32:37.671
What you doing?

32:37.672 --> 32:40.511
I thought a solicitor might help,
being as I'm about

32:40.512 --> 32:43.871
to be sent down till
my pubes have turned grey!

32:43.872 --> 32:46.351
The hearing's this afternoon!

32:46.352 --> 32:48.351
Hello?

33:00.765 --> 33:02.964
Ah...

33:02.965 --> 33:04.444
Ah, morning.

33:04.445 --> 33:08.444
Well, morning.

33:08.525 --> 33:12.524
You OK?

33:12.725 --> 33:16.724
Still a little shell shocked.

33:18.365 --> 33:22.364
Libby's father left me with nothing,
even took the rent money.

33:22.885 --> 33:26.884
I told myself I'd never trust
another man as long as I lived.

33:27.645 --> 33:31.644
Glad you did.

33:32.005 --> 33:36.004
You're the first man to hold me
since he legged it.

33:39.365 --> 33:42.244
I've realised....

33:42.245 --> 33:46.244
I've just existed
these past 40 years.

34:09.281 --> 34:13.159
This is fascinating. It's all
about that ancient Mayan calendar.

34:13.161 --> 34:16.440
They reckon it ends on
the 21st December 2012.

34:16.440 --> 34:19.760
Apparently, the sun will
rise to a unique point and

34:19.761 --> 34:22.040
that'll be the end of the world.

34:22.041 --> 34:26.040
In that case we don't have to
worry about our livers then, do we?

34:28.001 --> 34:31.800
Look who I
found asleep in the garden shed.

34:31.801 --> 34:34.440
He didn't even notice
you weren't at home?

34:34.440 --> 34:38.440
I could pack my bags and
leave, he wouldn't notice.

34:39.041 --> 34:41.440
Ohh... Glass of water please, Karen.

34:41.440 --> 34:45.440
We're off.

34:46.721 --> 34:48.000
Ah, thank you.

34:48.001 --> 34:49.120
Oi, look after her.

34:49.121 --> 34:53.120
Oh, yeah, I will.

34:53.241 --> 34:57.240
In case you miss us.

34:57.561 --> 34:59.960
You shouldn't have.

34:59.961 --> 35:03.960
Are you all right?

35:11.281 --> 35:13.080
Bye then.

35:13.081 --> 35:14.960
See you in a bit, Patty.

35:14.961 --> 35:18.080
Yeah.
Right, thanks.

35:18.081 --> 35:20.800
They've arrived at court.
I should be there.

35:20.801 --> 35:22.680
I'll cover.

35:22.681 --> 35:26.680
Make up for trashing
the place last night.

35:27.281 --> 35:31.280
Karen, your family need you.

35:32.041 --> 35:36.040
Carl.

35:37.841 --> 35:38.520
Nah, no way.

35:38.521 --> 35:42.520
It's in your job description.

35:44.761 --> 35:47.720
Er... Carl?

35:47.721 --> 35:50.640
I could give you a hand, love.

35:50.641 --> 35:54.640
No, thanks. I don't want
all the stock going missing.

36:04.561 --> 36:06.720
Libby Croker, will you marry me?

36:06.721 --> 36:07.760
Oh, get up, Frank.

36:07.761 --> 36:09.320
You're only saying it because
I've been nagging you all week.

36:09.321 --> 36:10.520
No!

36:10.521 --> 36:13.400
I'm saying it because I
want you to be me wife.

36:13.401 --> 36:17.400
Then why don't you
do anything about it?

36:18.601 --> 36:22.600
I wanted it to be a surprise.

36:22.921 --> 36:25.760
What? Have you planned the wedding?

36:25.761 --> 36:28.320
Oi, anyone serving or what?

36:28.321 --> 36:31.960
John, John. We're having a
private conversation. Do you mind?

36:31.961 --> 36:33.800
So what do you say?

36:33.801 --> 36:35.400
Yes!

36:35.401 --> 36:38.560
When is it?

36:38.561 --> 36:42.320
They reckon
it ends on the 21st December 2012.

36:42.321 --> 36:46.320
22nd of December. 2012.

36:46.561 --> 36:48.760
That's ages away.

36:48.761 --> 36:51.640
Yeah, but gives us a chance to

36:51.641 --> 36:53.760
save up for a decent honeymoon.

36:53.761 --> 36:57.760
Abroad, like.
I want to do it properly this time.

36:57.801 --> 37:01.800
Now, let me assist the future
Mrs Gallagher in the distribution

37:02.001 --> 37:03.760
of alcoholic beverages.

37:03.761 --> 37:05.560
No, you're all right. I can cope.

37:05.561 --> 37:07.480
Libby, Libby...

37:07.481 --> 37:10.480
You're going to be me wife.

37:10.481 --> 37:12.880
We're a team. A partnership.

37:12.881 --> 37:16.880
We need to start
as we mean to go on.

37:18.601 --> 37:22.160
Do you, erm, want a drink?

37:22.161 --> 37:26.160
Nah, I'm all right.

37:30.881 --> 37:34.240
I owe you an apology.

37:34.241 --> 37:36.080
You were right.

37:36.081 --> 37:39.720
I was overreacting.

37:39.721 --> 37:42.920
Do you want me to have a word with
the prick?

37:42.921 --> 37:46.920
It's OK, it's all sorted.
I reckon he's learnt his lesson.

37:48.521 --> 37:52.520
Oi. Show us yer tits!

37:54.881 --> 37:58.880
Aaaaah! Aaah shit!

37:58.961 --> 38:02.960
You bitch!

38:04.161 --> 38:08.160
And what do the defence have to say?

38:08.601 --> 38:12.600
Your honour!

38:13.881 --> 38:17.880
My family and I have become
the victims in all of this.

38:19.161 --> 38:22.160
The finger of guilt
was immediately pointed.

38:22.161 --> 38:24.280
We're completely innocent.

38:24.281 --> 38:28.280
You'd have to be fuckin' Rambo to
touch up any of the kids round here.

38:29.161 --> 38:32.760
I'm sorry. Apologies for
blaspheming, your honour.

38:32.761 --> 38:34.680
But the country's gone mad.

38:34.681 --> 38:37.640
Kiddie fiddling's become
a national obsession.

38:37.641 --> 38:39.720
I couldn't even take a photograph

38:39.721 --> 38:43.680
of me mate's little nephew
as a shepherd in his nativity play.

38:43.681 --> 38:46.000
I mean, what are people scared of?

38:46.001 --> 38:47.960
That some pervert will get
a stiffy

38:47.961 --> 38:51.120
looking at him with a tea towel
shoved on his head?

38:51.121 --> 38:54.080
Don't get me wrong - I want
to see proper paedos strung up.

38:54.081 --> 38:58.080
You know, the ones who get stuck in
before there's grass on the pitch.

38:58.361 --> 39:01.320
But well, you can't always be
100% sure they're legal, can you?

39:01.321 --> 39:04.520
Anyway, most 15-year-olds
enjoy a good shafting.

39:04.521 --> 39:07.680
The hormones are raging.
We targeted nonces

39:07.681 --> 39:10.800
in an effort to ensure that
they wouldn't have money left

39:10.801 --> 39:14.800
for sweets or puppies, or whatever
they use to get their end away.

39:15.321 --> 39:18.360
But when they barged
in our home yesterday,

39:18.361 --> 39:21.920
we were thrown into a nightmare.

39:21.921 --> 39:25.920
We're the heroes in all of this,
not the villains.

39:30.121 --> 39:34.120
Thank you.

39:37.001 --> 39:40.400
Case dismissed.

39:40.401 --> 39:43.160
Who's a clever boy then, Mickey?

39:43.161 --> 39:44.760
Wrong date on warrant.

39:44.761 --> 39:48.760
Improper police paperwork.

39:51.281 --> 39:52.720
This is the living room.

39:52.721 --> 39:56.720
Aha.

40:00.721 --> 40:02.120
Do you watch Corrie?

40:02.121 --> 40:03.160
Of course.

40:03.161 --> 40:04.360
Good.

40:04.361 --> 40:08.360
Could've been the
shortest marriage in history.

40:18.281 --> 40:22.280
There.

40:23.481 --> 40:24.840
I'd better unpack.

40:24.841 --> 40:26.440
Ah, that can wait.

40:26.441 --> 40:29.840
I've a little surprise.

40:29.841 --> 40:32.360
I suppose you could call it

40:32.361 --> 40:36.360
a wedding present.

40:42.561 --> 40:46.240
This one's for you. The mahogany.

40:46.241 --> 40:47.760
I bought mine years ago.

40:47.761 --> 40:49.800
Well, I...!

40:49.801 --> 40:53.800
I'm not going to pass those
things every time I come in.

40:54.081 --> 40:55.960
You can shift them in the spare room.

40:55.961 --> 40:59.960
No need for that.

41:11.081 --> 41:12.600
Go on.

41:12.601 --> 41:16.600
Surprise me.

41:22.521 --> 41:26.520
I didn't realise you...

41:28.401 --> 41:29.840
Am I not enough to live for?

41:29.841 --> 41:32.240
Oh, Patty.

41:32.241 --> 41:35.520
I thought you'd change your mind once
we were married.

41:35.521 --> 41:37.440
I thought you'd want to be with me.

41:37.441 --> 41:38.800
Oh, believe me, I do!

41:38.801 --> 41:42.800
That's why I still want
you to come with me.

41:46.281 --> 41:50.280
We could have a good life!

41:50.761 --> 41:54.760
You only feel like this because
you've been on your own so long.

41:56.321 --> 41:59.320
Once you have
people round you, people

41:59.321 --> 42:01.960
who need you, everything changes.

42:01.961 --> 42:04.760
Patty! I've been ringing
your helpline for years.

42:04.761 --> 42:06.040
I know, I know!

42:06.041 --> 42:08.080
It's only a matter of time.

42:08.081 --> 42:09.400
Yes, but not today.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.240
Your daughter has her own life now.

42:11.241 --> 42:15.240
You wouldn't want to die alone
in some grotty nursing home.

42:16.641 --> 42:20.640
No, but...

42:23.721 --> 42:27.240
Come with me, Patty.

42:27.241 --> 42:31.240
Today.

42:35.841 --> 42:39.840
You OK?

42:42.921 --> 42:46.920
Just see it as going away on our
honeymoon...that will last eternity.

42:54.281 --> 42:58.280
See you on the other side.

43:03.921 --> 43:05.600
Five...four...

43:05.601 --> 43:09.600
three...

43:09.681 --> 43:12.560
..two...

43:12.561 --> 43:14.240
..one.

43:14.241 --> 43:18.240
Ahh!

43:58.121 --> 43:59.520
I'm having a few problems.

43:59.521 --> 44:01.880
Not on the kitchen table, Carl!

44:01.881 --> 44:05.880
How d'you get that?

44:06.121 --> 44:08.160
Punter wouldn't pay
their instalment.

44:08.161 --> 44:11.360
Which one?

44:11.361 --> 44:13.680
Walker.

44:13.681 --> 44:14.920
Debbie Walker?

44:14.921 --> 44:17.240
A woman?

44:17.241 --> 44:18.680
Where are the babies?

44:18.681 --> 44:20.000
At the creche.

44:20.001 --> 44:24.000
What bleeding creche?

44:28.041 --> 44:30.640
What?!

44:30.641 --> 44:33.120
I'm taking you off the rounds, mate.

44:33.121 --> 44:35.120
You've got enough
on your plate here.

44:35.121 --> 44:38.560
I'll start helping
out with Cilla more.

44:38.561 --> 44:40.600
I'll do her night feeds. Mondays.

44:40.601 --> 44:43.720
Not on a bingo night.

44:43.721 --> 44:46.640
'We all end up with
some sort of baggage

44:46.641 --> 44:49.840
'but the thing that determines
whether you'll be carting round a

44:49.841 --> 44:53.640
'little Gucci or a fuck-off Samsonite
for the rest of your life,

44:53.641 --> 44:57.000
'it's all about how much is
invested in you as a nipper.

44:57.001 --> 45:01.000
'I may not be bringing
in any actual money...

45:01.721 --> 45:04.840
'..but what I do is priceless.

45:04.841 --> 45:08.720
'After all,
I'm busy creating the future.'

45:08.721 --> 45:10.568
When was the last time you slept?

45:10.568 --> 45:11.407
Last Tuesday.

45:11.408 --> 45:14.607
Oh, for fuck's sake.

45:14.608 --> 45:17.367
One in four people in this
country are mentally unstable.

45:17.368 --> 45:18.545
Will I get used to it?

45:18.545 --> 45:21.424
We'll have that place like a
palace by the time we finish.

45:21.425 --> 45:24.944
If your husband's out, I'll come
round and sort your pipes out.

45:24.945 --> 45:26.104
He's having an affair.

45:26.105 --> 45:27.744
What?!

45:27.745 --> 45:31.224
I want the pair of yous out my
house. You're not welcome.

45:31.225 --> 45:32.906
This is the devil's work!
