WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.958
A dollar eighty-nine.
Why is this $1.89?

00:04.120 --> 00:06.076
Why is there no
haggling in this country?

00:06.240 --> 00:09.232
We like to think we've progressed
beyond a knife fight for a drink.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.994
Not me.
Everything should be negotiable.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.037
- Restaurants too?
- Absolutely.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.078
Are you telling me there is
no room to move on pasta?

00:17.240 --> 00:19.037
All starches are a scam.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.596
Yeah, especially ziti,
with that big hole.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.393
Excuse me. How much is this?

00:24.560 --> 00:26.676
- A dollar nineteen.
- I'll give you a quarter.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.319
Get the hell out of here.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.948
- Tell him 40 and no fork.
- Thirty.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.350
That's it. You leave
and never come back.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.590
How about we leave
and come back in a week?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.034
Deal.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.558
All right. See?
We got something there.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.114
Oh, check it out.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.274
Kenny Rogers Roasters
finally opened.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.750
Hey, look at the size of
that neon chicken on the roof.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.558
Rogers can't sell chicken around here.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.392
We got chicken places
on every block.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.676
He is The Gambler.

00:59.120 --> 01:02.999
Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet
store. I'm helping him pick out a turtle.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.919
- Try and stay calm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.797
- Hey. Jerry?
- Seth.

01:08.960 --> 01:11.030
Wow, what has it been,
like, five years?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.111
- At least.
- You want to grab lunch?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.352
I'm actually
headed back to the office.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.033
Seth, it's me.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.998
What's more important than catching
up with an old college buddy?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.549
Well, I am supposed
to be in this meeting.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.271
Blow it off. Remember Poli-Sci?
How many of those did we go to?

01:27.800 --> 01:30.712
- All right, I guess I can go.
- All right. All right.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.916
- Hey, whatever happened to Moochy?
- He's dead.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.513
Is that right?

01:35.040 --> 01:37.918
Still don't know how you can call lunch
with me a business expense.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.991
- What do you think of the catalogue?
- Stinks.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.673
There, we just talked business.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.269
We have the down comforter
and the cookware you liked.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.000
Great. Put it on the Peterman
account with the other stuff.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.752
You know what we have
you might like?

01:49.920 --> 01:51.638
I'll take it.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.075
Hey, you like?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.591
I think it looks very nice on you.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.998
Really?

02:01.560 --> 02:03.198
Elaine?

02:03.760 --> 02:05.910
- The Peterman account?
- Why not?

02:06.080 --> 02:08.639
And some hair
for my little friend here.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.072
So how's your stand-up career?

02:11.240 --> 02:13.879
Good. As a matter of fact,
I almost had my own show in Japan.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.792
- You speak Japanese?
- No.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.032
So you would have done it in
Japan, but in English?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.671
I don't know.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.919
So, what's this job of yours?

02:26.400 --> 02:30.075
Big investment firm.
We just got the Citibank account.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.232
In fact, today was our
first big meeting with them.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.957
The meeting you blew off?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.917
Yeah.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.316
Wasn't that kind of important?

02:42.880 --> 02:44.552
Yeah.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.236
And I bought a whole new set
of cookware and a water pick.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.834
- You use a water pick?
- Sure. Water pick...

02:53.000 --> 02:55.116
...floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.748
So you go into the bathroom 11,
you're in bed by what, 2?

02:57.920 --> 03:01.708
At the latest. Oh, hang on a second.
I've got another call.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.552
- Hello?
- Good day, Miss Benes...

03:04.720 --> 03:06.073
...it's Roger lpswich.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.276
Oh, hey, how are things
doing in accounting?

03:08.440 --> 03:11.512
Miss Benes, I notice you've been
charging quite a bit of merchandise...

03:11.680 --> 03:12.999
...on the Peterman account.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.355
Well, I am the president.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.229
Yes, and we're all very impressed.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.393
Nevertheless, the expense account
is for business purposes only.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.039
Well... Well, isn't the president
allowed to do anything that they want?

03:28.200 --> 03:29.713
No.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.872
I'll be in your office
first thing tomorrow. Good day.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.951
Good day.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.238
Hello?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.631
Anybody?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.074
Hey.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.915
Hey. Why didn't you
get the big one?

03:58.760 --> 04:01.399
This hat just bottles in the heat.
I don't even need a coat.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.879
It's unbelievable.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.918
- I don't believe it.
- And I got a date with the saleswoman.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.708
She got a little Marisa Tomei
thing going on.

04:08.880 --> 04:12.077
Too bad you've got a little
George Costanza thing going on.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.708
I'm going out with her tomorrow.
She had errands to run.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.313
That's a date?

04:16.480 --> 04:18.834
What's the difference?
You know the way I work.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.637
I'm like a commercial jingle.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.634
First, it's a little irritating. You hear it
a few times. You hum it in the shower.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.997
By the third date, it's "By Mennen."

04:28.960 --> 04:30.871
How you make sure
you get to the third date?

04:31.040 --> 04:33.918
If there's any doubt,
I do a leave-behind.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.550
Keys, gloves, scarf.
I go back to her place to pick it up...

04:37.720 --> 04:40.314
...date number two.
- That is so old.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.994
Why don't you just show up
at her house in a wooden horse?

04:46.360 --> 04:48.078
By Mennen

04:49.120 --> 04:50.712
What the...?

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:02.400 --> 05:03.674
What's going on in there?

05:03.840 --> 05:05.751
- What?
- That light.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.592
Oh, the red.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.673
Yeah, it's the chicken roaster sign.
It's right across from my window.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.193
Can't you shut the shades?

05:13.360 --> 05:15.351
They are shut.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.397
By the way, your friend Seth,
he stopped by.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.516
- Yeah? What'd he have to say?
- He was fired.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.469
As you can see, the comforter
I expensed is actually...

05:24.640 --> 05:27.791
...the Aristotle goose down tunic.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.078
- What do you think?
- Another bull's-eye.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.754
Well, Mr. Ipswich,
since every one of my expenses...

05:33.920 --> 05:38.550
...was obviously
for a legitimate business purpose...

05:38.720 --> 05:41.757
I just need to see the
sable hat you purchased yesterday.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.956
The hat? Why do you need to
see the hat?

05:44.120 --> 05:46.031
It cost $8000.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.679
What?

05:51.440 --> 05:54.830
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so
important, why did you go to lunch?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.319
We're old college buddies.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.471
I only knew you through Moochy.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.230
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it,
all right?

06:01.400 --> 06:04.597
The important thing is,
is we got a chance to catch up.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.274
Mind if I grab the want ads?

06:07.680 --> 06:10.353
Actually, I haven't read
Tank McNamara yet.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.229
How's life on the red planet?

06:19.360 --> 06:22.511
It's killing me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.832
All I can see is that giant red sun
in the shape of a chicken.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.749
Well, did you go down to the
Kenny Rogers and complain?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.512
Oh, they gave me the heave-ho.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.833
I don't think that Kenny Rogers has
any idea what's going on down there.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.592
What are you doing?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.748
- Getting some cereal.
- That's tomato juice.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.152
That looked like milk to me.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.397
Jerry, my rods
and cones are all screwed up.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.432
All right, that's it.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.830
I gotta move in with you, Jerry.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.071
I don't know, Kramer.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.113
My concern is that...

07:05.280 --> 07:08.238
...living together after a while we...

07:09.320 --> 07:12.790
...might start to get on
each other's nerves a little.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.875
Listen, I got an idea.
You're a heavy sleeper, right?

07:16.040 --> 07:17.393
Why don't we switch apartments?

07:17.560 --> 07:19.676
Or I could sleep in the park.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.474
You can knock these walls down,
make it an eight-room luxury suite.

07:24.640 --> 07:29.111
Jerry, these are load bearing walls.
They're not gonna come down.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.438
Yeah, that's no good.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.750
I may have to drive that place
out of business.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.912
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- Like we did in the '60s.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.071
Taking it to the streets.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.393
- Thanks, George, but I got it from here.
- Oh, no, I'm in already. Come on.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.277
So you wanna
get together tomorrow?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.351
No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.759
- What about this weekend?
- I'm gonna be busy for a while.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.640
Okay. See you.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.360
Hey, you forgot your keys.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.159
- Those aren't my keys.
- Well, they're not mine.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.310
They are my keys. How weird.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.389
- Goodbye, George.
- Yeah, bye.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.913
George, bye.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.710
Hello? You are not gonna
believe the date I just had.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.514
Costanza

08:33.559 --> 08:35.357
What do you mean,
you don't have the hat?

08:35.520 --> 08:37.272
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?

08:37.440 --> 08:39.431
No, dead.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.155
George, I need
that Russian hat back.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.231
All right, all right. I'll call Heather.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.597
You'll get your hat back.
I will get a second date.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.399
Now, watch the magic.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.236
Dial nine, Merlin.

08:58.840 --> 09:02.515
- Hello?
- Heather, hi, it's George Costanza.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.719
Listen, I don't mean
to bother you, but silly me...

09:06.880 --> 09:10.236
...l... I think I may have left my hat
in your apartment, so I thought...

09:10.400 --> 09:13.710
...l'd just come by later and pick it up.
- You didn't leave a hat here.

09:13.880 --> 09:18.795
I'm pretty sure I left it behind the
cushion of the chair, accidentally.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.996
No hat. George, I've gotta go.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.755
You know what,
maybe I'll just come... Hey, hey.

09:30.400 --> 09:34.234
- Seth?
- Jerry, hi. What do you think?

09:34.400 --> 09:37.039
I think you're taking the trash
out for this chicken place...

09:37.200 --> 09:40.556
...but that couldn't be.
- Yeah, I'm the new manager.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.359
But you were an executive.
This is fast food.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.909
Not fast food. Good food quickly.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.389
Hey, next time lunch
will be on me, huh, Jer?

09:48.560 --> 09:49.913
Hey!

09:50.280 --> 09:53.078
Stay away from the chicken!
It's bad!

09:53.240 --> 09:55.754
Bad chicken! Mess you up!

09:55.920 --> 09:58.480
That's not going to be
good for business.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.029
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.393
I'm so glad we switched apartments.
It was the perfect solution.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.599
Kramer, if I'm gonna live over there,
you gotta take some of this stuff out.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.274
I mean, this thing
is really freaking me out.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.830
I feel like it's gonna come to life
in the middle of the night and kill me.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.554
What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.998
And one other thing, I don't want
Newman using my...

10:27.160 --> 10:28.718
Oh, no.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.878
- Nice place you got here, Kramer.
- Yeah.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.237
A man could really
get some thinking done.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.959
Don't get too comfortable.
As soon as Seth gets a real job...

10:39.120 --> 10:42.078
...you two are going back in that
chicken supernova.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.238
What's that, Rogers chicken?
Oh, get that out of here.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.278
I don't know. The man makes
a pretty strong bird.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.351
Yeah, but I'm boycotting.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.712
- What is that, hickory?
- Yeah.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.270
It's the wood that makes it good.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.513
Really?

11:12.280 --> 11:15.511
Stop it. What's the matter with you?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.750
- Can I help you?
- Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes.

11:23.920 --> 11:28.357
We met at Barney's.
I'm a friend of George Costanza's.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.039
Hi.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.239
Whether you're aware of it or not,
George had this pathetic little plan...

11:34.400 --> 11:38.552
...to leave something behind so he
could try and weasel a second date.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.312
- Really?
- I know.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.516
He... He has a real
confidence problem.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.830
- Well, not really...
- George.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.190
I know you told him
that you didn't have the hat...

11:49.360 --> 11:53.069
...because you didn't want to see
him again, and more sympathetic...

11:53.240 --> 11:54.992
...I could not be...

11:56.120 --> 11:59.032
...but I really do need
to have the hat back.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.839
Look. I don't know what to tell you,
but there's no hat here.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.639
I mean, maybe the maid took it.
I had people over but...

12:04.800 --> 12:05.949
Well, that makes sense.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.078
Well, then you wouldn't mind
if we took a second look around?

12:09.520 --> 12:10.999
Be my guest.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.832
Good to see you again.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.911
She's bluffing. She's got it
stashed away in there somewhere.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.878
This is an absolute disaster.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.793
Oh, I don't know. Check this out.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.595
You stole her clock?

12:38.240 --> 12:39.958
Well done.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.676
Yep. This is one for our side.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.197
What is that creaking?

13:03.360 --> 13:06.079
It's lik e I'm in the hold of a ship.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.196
I've gotta relax.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.278
Hello?

13:16.120 --> 13:18.634
Is somebody there?

13:18.800 --> 13:20.950
Mr. Marbles?

13:23.920 --> 13:26.992
So I told lpswich I'd have
the hat by this afternoon.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.550
- What am I going to do?
- You should sleep with him.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.912
Hi, buddy.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.428
I'm on no sleep, no sleep.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.558
You don't know what it's like.
Things are creaking and cracking...

13:44.720 --> 13:47.314
...and that red light
is burning my brain.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.197
- You look a little stressed.
- Oh, I'm stressed.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.190
So, Kramer, what am I supposed to do?
If I don't have that fur hat by 4:00...

13:58.360 --> 14:00.555
...they're gonna take me down
like Nixon.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.188
You know my friend
Bob Sacamano?

14:03.360 --> 14:04.793
I thought he was Kramer's friend.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.520
He called last night about
3 a.m. and we got to talking.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.309
He sells Russian hats
down at Battery Park, 40 bucks.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.150
Forty bucks? Are they sable?

14:14.320 --> 14:16.470
No, but the difference is negligible.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.034
Oh, yeah, I like this idea.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.872
- All right. Let's give it a shot. Let's go.
- Giddyup.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.712
- It's getting cold. It's getting cold.
- That was a close one.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.319
Why do we keep this from Jerry?

14:31.520 --> 14:35.991
If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Rogers
chicken, I'm back with the red menace.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.038
Miss Benes, the hat you charged
to the company was sable.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.830
This is nutria.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.516
Well, that's a... It's a kind of sable.

14:49.800 --> 14:53.031
No, it's a kind of rat.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.196
That's a rat hat?

14:56.440 --> 14:59.955
And a poorly made one,
even by rat hat standards.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.595
I've no choice but to
recommended your termination...

15:03.760 --> 15:06.433
...to the board of directors.
Nothing short of the approval...

15:06.600 --> 15:08.875
...of Peterman himself
will save you this time.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.474
But... But he's in the Burmese jungle.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.751
And quite mad, too, from what I hear.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.597
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Can I fire you?

15:18.240 --> 15:20.037
No.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.151
- So Heather called?
- Yeah, but get this.

15:24.320 --> 15:28.029
The message said,
"Call me if you have the time."

15:28.200 --> 15:30.873
If I have the time? You got it?

15:31.040 --> 15:33.918
No, but this is all very exciting.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.311
She knows that I have her clock.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.311
I know that she has my hat.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.630
I think she's getting ready
to make an exchange.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.475
Well, there is the possibility that
you've gone right out of your mind.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.640
I've looked at that. It seems unlikely.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.597
Well, I'd look again.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.115
So how come you didn't call
Jerry about all this?

15:53.280 --> 15:55.510
Jerry. I can't talk to Jerry anymore.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.717
Ever since he moved into
that apartment he's too much...

15:58.880 --> 16:00.632
...like you.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.631
That's a shame.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.633
Seth, you're the manager.
Can't you turn off that sign?

16:07.800 --> 16:11.270
Jerry, I lied.
I'm just an assistant manager.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.596
Number 67, family feast.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.752
Number 67. Right here. Right here.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.593
- Hello, Newman.
- Hello, Jerry.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.751
And don't forget
your steamed broccoli.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.194
Hold it.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.320
Broccoli? Newman,
you wouldn't eat broccoli...

16:28.480 --> 16:31.199
...if it was deep fried
in chocolate sauce.

16:32.640 --> 16:37.191
I love broccoli. It's good for you.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.952
Really?

16:39.360 --> 16:41.999
Then maybe
you'd like to have a piece.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.431
Gladly.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.991
Vile weed!

16:52.720 --> 16:54.312
It's for Kramer, isn't it? I knew it.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.550
The greasy doorknob.
The licking of the fingers.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.757
- He's hooked on the chicken, isn't he?
- Yes! Yes, now, please...

16:59.920 --> 17:01.672
...someone, honey mustard.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.910
Newman, what took you...
Hey, buddy.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.637
- That was good.
- Expecting Newman?

17:19.800 --> 17:21.711
That's funny, because
I happened upon him...

17:21.880 --> 17:23.551
...down at the
Kenny Rogers Roasters.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.553
Kenny Rogers.
Oh, boy, I hate that place.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.678
He was buying quite a load of chicken,
almost enough for two people.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.115
- As long as one of them is not him.
- Yeah.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.874
Oh, hey, you know,
Elaine, she stopped by.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.474
Yeah, dropped off
that Bob Sacamano hat.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.473
Yeah, oh, she's upset with him.
Yes, sirree.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.790
Yeah, well, thanks for stopping by.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.634
I sure do miss my apartment.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.756
Maybe I'll switch back.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.638
You don't want to think about that.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.553
Otherwise, I'd have no choice
but to put that banner back up...

17:52.720 --> 17:55.837
...and run that Rogers
right out of town.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.118
I don't think you will. Matter of fact I'll
save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.430
Go ahead. Put the banner up.
Doesn't matter to me.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.318
- All right.
- No, Jerry.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.550
I need that chicken!
I've got to have that ch...

18:06.720 --> 18:10.349
Now, you leave those roasters alone!
Kenny never hurt anybody!

18:11.280 --> 18:14.078
- You got a little problem.
- Oh, I got a big problem, Jerry!

18:26.120 --> 18:27.997
Here. Kneel here.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.309
- What?
- Kneel.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.471
Kneel? Okay.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.672
Elaine.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.719
Mr. Peterman.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.833
You speak Burmese?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.594
No, Elaine, that was gibberish.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.713
So did you have any
trouble finding the place?

18:57.880 --> 18:59.871
No, you're the only...

19:00.480 --> 19:03.995
...white-poet-warlord
in the neighbourhood.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.312
Are you an assassin?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.233
I work for your mail order catalogue.

19:10.400 --> 19:15.428
You're an errand girl sent
by grocery clerks to collect a bill.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.673
Well, actually, I do have a bill here.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.674
If you could just sign this
expense form...

19:23.840 --> 19:26.479
...I think I could still make
the last fan boat out of here.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.270
I'd be happy to, Elaine.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.953
Here you go.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.508
But I will have to see this hat.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.993
Right.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.479
So how do you want to do this?

19:47.640 --> 19:50.598
All right, George, I'll be honest.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.399
The first time we went out,
I found you very irritating.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.596
But after seeing you
a couple of times...

19:56.000 --> 19:58.719
...you sort of got stuck in my head.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.598
Costanza

20:02.080 --> 20:04.150
So you really don't have my hat?

20:04.320 --> 20:06.072
What?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.354
Let's go do something.

20:11.520 --> 20:15.308
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, that's... That's a sandwich.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.788
Damn salami.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.631
My clock.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.595
- You stole it?
- That damn delicatessen.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.911
That is the last time they
screw up one of my orders.

20:35.680 --> 20:39.116
Hey, Seth. Man, it is coming
down hard out there.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.678
Oh, gross.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.157
That's not gonna be
good for business.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.754
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.473
Kenny?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.038
Kenny?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.114
Kenny.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.078
Kenny.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.998
Kenny.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.112
Home at last.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.559
Is someone there?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.557
Mr. Marbles.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.356
This is the urban sombrero.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.829
I put it on the last catalogue cover.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.556
The horror.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.596
The horror.
