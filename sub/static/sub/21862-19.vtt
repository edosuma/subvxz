<i>"Finding Zuzo" </i>

01:03.500 --> 01:06.416
<c.speaker>[Zuzo]
Wait, what? Where'd I go?

01:06.416 --> 01:07.958
<c.speakerTop>[Naomi]
There you are!

01:07.958 --> 01:09.250
<c.speakerTop>What are you doing up here?

01:09.250 --> 01:11.208
<c.speakerTop>[sighs] Just thinking about

01:11.208 --> 01:12.625
<c.speakerTop>the first time
my parents brought me

01:12.625 --> 01:13.958
<c.speakerTop>to Nueva Vista

01:13.958 --> 01:15.625
<c.speakerTop>when I was just
a little girl.

01:15.625 --> 01:16.833
<c.speakerTop>You see that lighthouse?

01:16.833 --> 01:18.458
<c.speakerTop>My father had it built.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.708
<c.speakerTop>Oh. [chuckles] Really?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.416
<c.speaker>OK, you're fidgeting
with your necklace.

01:24.416 --> 01:27.375
<c.speaker>-What's bugging you?
-Oh! Uh, well...

01:27.375 --> 01:30.458
<c.speaker>Actually, heh, it's
about the lighthouse.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.083
<c.speaker>-It's...
-So beautiful.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.875
<c.speaker>-Too short.
-Too short?

01:33.875 --> 01:36.000
<c.speaker>It's one of
the tallest buildings
in the city.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.416
<c.speaker>But it's not tall enough.

01:38.416 --> 01:41.583
<c.speaker>My dad and I have been working
with the local harbormaster.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.000
<c.speaker>The port's so busy
that they have to signal ships

01:44.000 --> 01:45.500
<c.speaker>to wait for dock space.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.375
<c.speaker>But the lighthouse
is too short to be seen

01:47.375 --> 01:49.458
<c.speaker>by ships way out
in the ocean.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.875
<c.speaker>OK, then, let's make it taller.

01:51.875 --> 01:53.500
<c.speaker>We already looked into that.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.000
<c.speaker>The foundation
won't support it.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.458
<c.speaker>So, what exactly
are you saying?

01:58.458 --> 02:00.375
<c.speaker>We need to tear it down
and build a new one.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.458
<c.speaker>Tear it down?

02:03.458 --> 02:06.291
<c.speaker>Tear down the lighthouse
my father built?

02:06.291 --> 02:09.250
<c.speaker>The lighthouse that is
a symbol of Avaloran pride?

02:09.250 --> 02:11.166
<c.speaker>That lighthouse?

02:11.166 --> 02:14.458
<c.speaker>I know it means a lot to you,
but this is the best solution.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.458
<c.speaker>The best solution is
destroying a piece

02:16.458 --> 02:17.833
<c.speaker>of Avalor's history?

02:17.833 --> 02:20.458
<c.speaker>If it helps
Avalor's future, yes.

02:20.458 --> 02:24.166
<c.speaker>[scoffs] I think I know
what's best for my kingdom,
thank you.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.166
<c.speaker>Well, it's not entirely
up to you, Elena.

02:27.166 --> 02:29.291
<c.speaker>A decision this big
is made by the Grand Council.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.458
<c.speaker>[scoffs] Fine.
Go to the Council

02:31.458 --> 02:33.875
<c.speaker>and let them tell you
what a terrible idea it is.

02:33.875 --> 02:36.458
<c.speaker>They won't, because it's
a great idea.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.750
<c.speaker>[scoffs] Huh! We'll see.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.208
<c.speaker>I guess we will.

02:41.416 --> 02:42.583
<c.speaker>Uh-- Elena!

02:42.583 --> 02:44.583
<c.speaker>-What?!
-What did I do?

02:44.583 --> 02:46.583
<c.speaker>[sighs] Nothing.
I'm sorry.

02:46.583 --> 02:50.833
<c.speaker>I was just having
a... thing with Naomi.
[chuckles] What's up?

02:50.833 --> 02:53.250
<c.speaker>I'd like permission
to assemble a team of guards

02:53.250 --> 02:55.500
<c.speaker>to go after Victor
and Carla Delgado.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.375
<c.speaker>They're the last big threat
to Avalor, and they're
still at large.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.208
<c.speaker>Now, that is a great idea.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.583
<c.speaker>Because I know a great idea
from a terrible idea,

03:03.583 --> 03:05.458
<c.speaker>unlike Naomi, who-- who--
who thinks we should

03:05.458 --> 03:07.375
<c.speaker>tear down the lighthouse
because it's too short

03:07.375 --> 03:09.458
<c.speaker>and build a taller one! Huh!

03:09.458 --> 03:11.291
<c.speaker>Sounds like a good solution
to me.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.708
<c.speaker>[gasps] Well...ugh.

03:12.708 --> 03:14.125
<c.speaker>No one asked you!

03:15.333 --> 03:17.333
<c.speaker>Permission granted, by the way.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.416
<c.speaker>I'm gonna slam the door now,
but it's not because of you.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.291
<c.speaker>OK?

03:23.375 --> 03:26.333
<c.speaker>Zuzo? Zuzo? Zuzo!

03:26.333 --> 03:28.208
<c.speaker>-Hiya, Prince--
-There you are!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.958
<c.speaker>Naomi wants to tear down
the old lighthouse,

03:29.958 --> 03:31.375
<c.speaker>but that lighthouse
means a lot to me,

03:31.375 --> 03:34.416
<c.speaker>and she won't even listen!

03:34.416 --> 03:36.375
<c.speaker>-Zuzo!
-Hey, stop that!

03:36.375 --> 03:38.500
<c.speaker>You're not supposed
to be in there! Go away! Shoo!

03:38.500 --> 03:40.458
<c.speaker>-What are you doing?
-Hang on, princess.

03:40.458 --> 03:42.375
<c.speaker>Trouble in the Spirit World.
Be right back!

03:42.375 --> 03:44.458
<c.speaker>Get out of my house!

03:44.458 --> 03:45.875
<c.speaker>Zuzo?

03:47.375 --> 03:50.500
<c.speakerTop>Zuzo? Zuzo?

03:50.500 --> 03:53.416
<c.speaker>I'm worried, Mateo.
Zuzo said he'd be right back,

03:53.416 --> 03:54.875
<c.speaker>but he's been gone for hours.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.583
<c.speaker>You're right. It doesn't sound
like him at all.

03:57.583 --> 03:59.208
<c.speaker>I'll summon Cacahuate.

03:59.208 --> 04:02.291
<c.speaker><i>Illuminara Mateo Wayohel! </i>

04:05.583 --> 04:07.625
<c.speaker>Hmm. <i>Illuminara-- </i>

04:07.625 --> 04:10.708
<c.speaker>[Cacahuate]
<i>Hold your spirit horses, </i>
<i>I'm coming! </i>

04:10.708 --> 04:12.958
<c.speaker>I'm a sloth, Matteo!

04:12.958 --> 04:14.833
<c.speaker>We're known for
our thoroughness, but--

04:14.833 --> 04:17.166
<c.speaker>-But not for your speed?
-Oh, hi, Elena!

04:17.166 --> 04:19.583
<c.speaker>You're just the person
I wanted to see.

04:19.583 --> 04:21.000
<c.speaker>Where's Zuzo?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.750
<c.speaker>Uh, we were hoping
you could tell us.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.000
<c.speaker>I've been lookin' for him
all day.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.708
<c.speaker>I thought he was with you.

04:26.708 --> 04:28.875
<c.speaker>He was here this morning,
but then he had to rush back

04:28.875 --> 04:31.416
<c.speaker>to the Spirit World
for some kind of emergency.

04:31.416 --> 04:34.000
<c.speaker>I don't know anything
about an emergency.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.625
<c.speaker>When he left,
he was yelling at someone

04:35.625 --> 04:36.958
<c.speaker>to get out of his house.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.583
<c.speaker>[gasps] He might be in trouble!

04:39.583 --> 04:41.416
<c.speaker>Oh, who would want
to hurt Zuzo?

04:41.416 --> 04:42.958
<c.speaker>I don't know, but...

04:42.958 --> 04:45.750
<c.speaker>there is a dark side
of the Spirit World

04:45.750 --> 04:49.708
<c.speaker>filled with all manner
of terrible... [stammering]

04:49.708 --> 04:52.416
<c.speaker>I can't even talk about them!

04:52.416 --> 04:54.583
<c.speaker>We have to find Zuzo! Now!

04:54.583 --> 04:56.958
<c.speaker>OK, Princess,
I'll look for him.

04:56.958 --> 04:58.375
<c.speaker>I want to go, too!

04:58.375 --> 05:00.458
<c.speaker>You know humans
aren't supposed to go--

05:00.458 --> 05:02.083
<c.speaker>She already went once.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.166
<c.speaker>To rescue me
from the Zanies, remember?

05:04.166 --> 05:06.458
<c.speaker>Please, Mateo, I remember.

05:06.458 --> 05:10.083
<c.speaker>Come on, Cacahuate,
Zuzo has always
been there for me.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.708
<c.speaker>I need to be there for him.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.625
<c.speaker>You're right, Princess.
We both do.

05:16.625 --> 05:20.875
<c.speaker>All right, let's break
a long-standing rule, again.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.458
<c.speaker>Hold on.

05:22.458 --> 05:23.458
<c.speaker>[Elena gasps]

05:30.875 --> 05:33.250
<c.speaker>-Where are we?
-Zuzo's den.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.625
<c.speaker>You said something
was in his house, right?

05:35.625 --> 05:37.458
<c.speaker>What is this stuff? Ooh!

05:37.458 --> 05:38.458
<c.speaker>[gasps] Huh.

05:39.875 --> 05:42.500
<c.speaker>It's moth silk.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.708
<c.speaker>[gasps]

05:43.708 --> 05:45.583
<c.speaker>Well, if I were
a betting sloth,

05:45.583 --> 05:47.875
<c.speaker>I would say there was a fight.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.583
<c.speaker>We have to ask around.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.583
<c.speaker>Someone must have seen
what happened!

05:51.583 --> 05:55.000
<c.speaker>[chirps] He was rushing
back from Avalor
saying something about

05:55.000 --> 05:56.875
<c.speaker>dealing with a moth problem
at home?

05:56.875 --> 05:59.125
<c.speaker>You have moths
in the Spirit World?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.708
<c.speaker>Not around here.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.500
<c.speaker>Moths live in the dark side
of the tree.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.750
<c.speaker>Now that you mention it,

06:04.750 --> 06:06.583
<c.speaker>I did see a big cloud
of purple moths

06:06.583 --> 06:07.708
<c.speaker>carrying a giant purple cocoon

06:07.708 --> 06:09.333
<c.speaker>toward the dark side
of the tree.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.583
<c.speaker>Ooh! My human needs me.
Gotta go!

06:12.583 --> 06:13.875
<c.speaker>I don't know about you,

06:13.875 --> 06:15.708
<c.speaker>but the only
magical purple moths

06:15.708 --> 06:17.625
<c.speaker>I've ever seen
came from Orizaba.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.458
<c.speaker>How do you know Orizaba?

06:19.458 --> 06:22.291
<c.speaker>During the last eclipse,
she tried to invade Avalor,

06:22.291 --> 06:24.708
<c.speaker>but Zuzo showed me
how to send her back here.

06:24.708 --> 06:26.583
<c.speaker>Well, that explains it.
Wha-ho!

06:26.583 --> 06:29.208
<c.speaker>Orizaba holds a grudge.

06:29.208 --> 06:32.458
<c.speaker>So it sounds like
she sent her moths
to capture Zuzo.

06:32.458 --> 06:35.333
<c.speaker>Which means to get him back,
we have to go to the dark side.

06:35.333 --> 06:38.000
<c.speaker>Yeah, that makes sen--
Go to the dark side?!

06:42.208 --> 06:44.083
<c.speaker>[laughing]

06:44.083 --> 06:46.083
<c.speaker>Had enough, dearie?

06:46.083 --> 06:48.291
<c.speaker>Oh, I could do this all day.

06:48.291 --> 06:50.583
<c.speaker>Nothin' I like more
than hangin' out!

06:50.583 --> 06:53.708
<c.speaker>[laughs] Oh, you won't
be hanging long.

06:53.708 --> 06:57.500
<c.speakerTop>[whimpering]

06:57.500 --> 07:01.583
<c.speaker>Unless you give me
your magic stripes.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.458
<c.speaker>Let me guess, so you
can go back to the human world

07:03.458 --> 07:05.458
<c.speaker>and conquer it
with eternal darkness?

07:05.458 --> 07:09.708
<c.speaker>Ugh, yes. And get even
with the princess
who did this to me.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
<c.speaker>[gulps]

07:16.000 --> 07:18.833
<c.speaker>Now, give me your stripes,

07:18.833 --> 07:21.875
<c.speaker>or it's rock-a-bye-bye baby.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.166
<c.speaker>[whimpers]

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
<c.speaker>Ooh, Elena, you can't just

07:27.000 --> 07:28.583
<c.speaker>drop in on the dark side!

07:28.583 --> 07:30.333
<c.speaker>The dark spirits,
you know them,

07:30.333 --> 07:32.166
<c.speaker>they would see us coming,
and boom!

07:32.166 --> 07:33.708
<c.speaker>Who knows what they'll
do to us?

07:33.708 --> 07:35.833
<c.speaker>But Zuzo needs us!

07:35.833 --> 07:38.333
<c.speaker>I know. Wait.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.750
<c.speaker>There is one other way in.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.875
<c.speaker>Through the shadow tunnels!

07:42.875 --> 07:45.708
<c.speaker>Weren't those the tunnels
where the Zanies tried
to take Mateo?

07:45.708 --> 07:48.708
<c.speaker>Yep. The shadow tunnels
snake throughout
the whole tree,

07:48.708 --> 07:51.583
<c.speaker>so we can sneak in
without being seen.

07:51.583 --> 07:52.958
<c.speaker>Then what are we waiting for?

07:52.958 --> 07:55.625
<c.speaker>I'll tell ya!
I don't know the way!

07:55.625 --> 07:58.458
<c.speaker>We might get lost
and never come out!

07:58.458 --> 08:00.333
<c.speaker>[gasps] What about Bobo?

08:00.333 --> 08:03.833
<c.speaker>Bobo? The monkey who stole
my magic stripes?

08:03.833 --> 08:06.625
<c.speaker>[laughs] You're joking, right?

08:06.625 --> 08:08.208
<c.speaker>When he became
King of the Zanies,

08:08.208 --> 08:09.875
<c.speaker>they took him into
the shadow tunnels.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.583
<c.speaker>He probably knows them
backwards and forwards by now!

08:12.583 --> 08:14.000
<c.speaker>But we can't trust Bobo!

08:14.000 --> 08:16.625
<c.speaker>What if he tries to steal
my stripes again?

08:16.625 --> 08:18.708
<c.speaker>I think he learned his lesson

<c.speaker>You never apologized
for that time you stole
my stripes.

<c.speaker>Tell your servant
that a monarch
never apologizes.

<c.speaker>He's not my servant.
You know that.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.583
<c.speaker>And monarchs do apologize.

09:49.583 --> 09:53.833

<c.speaker>Me? You're the reason
the pods went off.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.708
<c.speaker>If you hadn't
grabbed them from me,

16:51.708 --> 16:53.125
<c.speaker>I coulda saved Zuzo!

16:53.125 --> 16:54.958
<c.speaker>Or gotten yourself caught!

16:54.958 --> 16:57.125
<c.speaker>Well, now Elena got caught,
thanks to you!

17:00.375 --> 17:02.458
<c.speaker>Thanks to both of us.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.291
<c.speaker>We did this together.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.375
<c.speaker>[Zuzo whimpering]

17:07.375 --> 17:09.375
<c.speaker>I guess we did.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.208
<c.speaker>Well, that's one thing
we agree on.

17:12.208 --> 17:15.208
<c.speaker>Look, I'm still angry at you
for stealing my stripes.

17:15.208 --> 17:19.833
<c.speaker>And I'm angry at you
for not respecting
my kingliness.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.250
<c.speaker>What do you say
we set aside our feud

17:22.250 --> 17:24.000
<c.speaker>and save our friends!

17:24.000 --> 17:26.166
<c.speaker>That's bananas!

17:26.166 --> 17:30.166
<c.speaker>But what if
we set aside our feud

17:30.166 --> 17:32.000
<c.speaker>and save our friends?

17:32.000 --> 17:36.958
<c.speaker>That's what I just sa--
[grumbling]

17:36.958 --> 17:40.208
<c.speaker>Then let's do that,
Your Majesty.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.833
<c.speaker>OK, I have a plan.

17:42.833 --> 17:46.208
<c.speaker>But I'm gonna need
your magic stripes.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.833
<c.speaker>My stripes?!

17:51.166 --> 17:55.333
<c.speaker>Well, if it'll
help our friends...

17:55.333 --> 17:59.166
<c.speaker><i>Vaya Raya Mistica! </i>

18:02.208 --> 18:06.458
<c.speaker>I'm trusting you
with one of my most
prized possessions.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.500
<c.speaker>And I'm trusting you
with mine.

18:12.875 --> 18:16.125
<c.speaker>I already told you.
First, you let the princess go.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.875
<c.speaker>Then, I give you my stripes.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.375
<c.speaker>You are in no position
to bargain!

18:20.375 --> 18:22.375
<c.speaker>- <i>Hola, </i>yoohoo!
-[gasps]

18:22.375 --> 18:25.958
<c.speaker>Look what I have!
Ooo, magic stripes! [laughs]

18:25.958 --> 18:28.250
<c.speaker>They're yours
if you can catch me!

18:28.250 --> 18:30.458
<c.speaker>Then I guess they're mine!

18:30.458 --> 18:31.250
<c.speaker>-[Bobo laughs]
-[Orizaba grunts]

18:31.250 --> 18:32.875
<c.speaker>[laughing]

18:32.875 --> 18:33.875
<c.speaker>[grunts]

18:33.875 --> 18:35.750
<c.speaker>Missed me!

18:35.750 --> 18:37.416
<c.speaker>[laughs]

18:37.416 --> 18:38.416
<c.speaker>[Orizaba grunts]

18:38.416 --> 18:39.458
<c.speaker>[both gasp]

18:41.208 --> 18:42.291
<c.speaker>Get the monkey!

18:58.250 --> 18:59.958
<c.speaker>[growling]

19:02.375 --> 19:03.625
<c.speaker>Wha--!

19:03.625 --> 19:05.875
<c.speaker>Ugh! Enough monkey business!

19:05.875 --> 19:07.291
<c.speaker>I want those stripes!

19:11.166 --> 19:13.291
<c.speaker>Bobo! What are you doing? Run!

19:16.625 --> 19:18.375
<c.speaker>Whoops!

19:18.375 --> 19:22.291
<c.speaker>[gasps] [exclaiming]

19:22.291 --> 19:26.708
<c.speaker>[Orizaba]
This isn't over!

19:26.708 --> 19:29.875
<c.speaker>[Orizaba's voice echoing]

19:41.708 --> 19:43.416
<c.speaker>Sure seems over to me.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.458
<c.speaker>How about that.
Your plan worked!

19:45.458 --> 19:47.375
<c.speaker>-[branch cracking]
-Huh?

19:47.375 --> 19:48.375
<c.speaker>[both screaming]

19:48.375 --> 19:49.375
<c.speaker>[both gasping]

19:53.875 --> 19:56.000
<c.speaker>[sighs] Nice catch, guys.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.250
<c.speaker>I always thought you two
would make a good team!

20:04.875 --> 20:06.875
<c.speaker>Thanks for coming
to find me, Elena.

20:06.875 --> 20:10.875
<c.speaker>Even spirit guides
need a little help
every now and then.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.333
<c.speaker>Now that we're all
safe and sound,

20:13.333 --> 20:15.583
<c.speaker>Here you go, Cacahuate.

20:15.583 --> 20:19.083
<c.speaker><i>Regresa Raya Mistica! </i>

20:21.500 --> 20:23.708
<c.speaker>And here you go, Bobo.

20:23.708 --> 20:27.500
<c.speaker>[laughs] Eh... um...

20:27.500 --> 20:30.458
<c.speaker>I'm sorry about your crown.

20:30.458 --> 20:34.125
<c.speaker>It was worth it
to get our friends back.

20:34.125 --> 20:38.375
<c.speaker>You know, I think Bobo
deserves another chance

20:38.375 --> 20:40.375
<c.speaker>to earn his own chanul stripes.

20:40.375 --> 20:43.333
<c.speaker>Aw, thanks.
But I'm perfectly happy being

20:43.333 --> 20:45.708
<c.speaker>the Most Exalted, High Superior
Top Banana King.

20:45.708 --> 20:46.708
<c.speaker>Nuh-uh!

20:46.708 --> 20:49.583
<c.speaker>Don't you mean "Hero King"?

20:49.583 --> 20:51.458
<c.speaker>Aww!

20:51.458 --> 20:52.458
<c.speaker>[grunts]

20:53.833 --> 20:55.500
<c.speaker>Mmm.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.083
<c.speaker>Would you look at that?

20:57.083 --> 20:58.625
<c.speaker>Ah, it's like
they're old friends.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.416
<c.speaker>Oh! That reminds me.

21:00.416 --> 21:02.875
<c.speaker>There's something I have
to take care of back home.

21:02.875 --> 21:03.875
<c.speaker>Can you give me a lift?

21:03.875 --> 21:05.750
<c.speaker>Of course, Princess.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.000
<c.speaker>[both]
Bye!

21:08.500 --> 21:10.375
<c.speaker>I like them.

21:13.583 --> 21:15.166
<c.speaker>[Elena]
Hey.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.375
<c.speaker>Oh. Hey.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.583
<c.speaker>-I'm sorry I--
-I shouldn't have--

21:20.583 --> 21:22.583
<c.speaker>[chuckles] You first.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.500
<c.speaker>I'm sorry
I was so hardheaded.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.416
<c.speaker>I've got ya beat there.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.500
<c.speaker>You know, if we put
our hard heads together,

21:30.500 --> 21:32.416
<c.speaker>I'm sure we can
figure this out.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.125
<c.speaker>I am, too.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.458
<c.speaker>OK. We need
a taller lighthouse, right?

21:36.458 --> 21:39.000
<c.speaker>Right, but without tearing
the old one down.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.458
<c.speaker>Hmm.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.750
<c.speaker>So, what if we move
the old lighthouse

21:42.750 --> 21:43.833
<c.speaker>to higher ground?

21:43.833 --> 21:46.208
<c.speaker>You mean, dismantle it...

21:46.208 --> 21:48.500
<c.speaker>[Elena]
And rebuild it
on one of those rocks!

21:48.500 --> 21:50.708
<c.speaker>Then it will be visible
from way out in the ocean!

21:50.708 --> 21:52.375
<c.speaker>Problem solved!

21:52.375 --> 21:54.125
<c.speaker>Should I assemble the rest
of the Grand Council

21:54.125 --> 21:56.375
<c.speaker>so you can tell them
your great idea?

21:56.375 --> 21:58.583
<c.speaker>Let's tell them together.

22:04.583 --> 22:06.375
<c.speaker>[end theme playing]
