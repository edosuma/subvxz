WEBVTT

00:02.237 --> 00:04.239
She has been playing dictator
since we left.

00:04.283 --> 00:05.371
I'm calling the shots

00:05.414 --> 00:07.721
because that's
how everyone voted.

00:07.764 --> 00:09.244
As for me killing you...

00:09.288 --> 00:11.725
it's always on my mind.

00:11.768 --> 00:13.770
We are auditors
for the Commonwealth.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.468
You're under
Level 1 assessment.

00:15.511 --> 00:16.643
Let's go!
Let's go!

00:16.686 --> 00:18.297
No! Mira.

00:20.995 --> 00:22.344
Yumiko!

00:22.388 --> 00:24.694
I have to stay.

00:24.738 --> 00:26.957
Maggie: Ahh! Negan!

03:13.515 --> 03:15.082
Frost: It's rusted shut.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.432
Safe bet
that they all are.

03:20.957 --> 03:24.134
Where's Maggie?

03:24.178 --> 03:26.267
She w--
She was right behind me.

03:40.325 --> 03:41.891
Alden:
Somebody boost me up.

03:41.935 --> 03:43.023
You go up there,
you're dead.

03:43.066 --> 03:44.372
She'd be pissed
if you tried.

03:44.416 --> 03:47.723
She'd want us
to keep moving forward.

03:54.469 --> 03:56.036
Alright, we need
to get that door open.

03:56.079 --> 03:57.385
Then we'll go from car to car

03:57.429 --> 03:58.473
until we hit
the front of the train.

03:58.517 --> 04:01.259
Then we'll hop off.

04:01.302 --> 04:03.173
And then we just keep going.

04:07.177 --> 04:09.876
Negan: Look out, guys.

06:06.993 --> 06:10.562
You know what this means,
don't you? The photo board?

06:10.605 --> 06:12.390
The Commonwealth is real.That was a wallet-sized
photo of you,

06:12.433 --> 06:14.435
which means it was
in your brother's wallet,

06:14.479 --> 06:16.742
which means he kept the wallet
on him in the apocalypse,

06:16.785 --> 06:18.308
possibly for 10-plus years,
and who does that?

06:18.352 --> 06:20.485
He sounds awesome.

06:20.528 --> 06:21.660
What?

06:21.703 --> 06:23.488
And also what you said.

06:23.531 --> 06:25.359
So what's the plan?

06:25.403 --> 06:27.317
They have structure.
Laws.

06:27.361 --> 06:28.623
Someone here's in charge,

06:28.667 --> 06:29.842
and I'm going to speak
to that person.

06:29.885 --> 06:31.931
That's it?
The plan is talking?

06:31.974 --> 06:36.022
Yes. Cold as ice.
Demand results.

06:36.065 --> 06:37.197
What?

06:37.240 --> 06:39.852
Nothing. It's just...

06:39.895 --> 06:42.158
it's your bro. You sure
you can be "cold as ice"?

06:42.202 --> 06:46.467
Yeah, I was a lawyer.
It comes naturally.

06:46.511 --> 06:49.644
Look, I love my brother.

06:49.688 --> 06:51.690
But I hadn't seen him
in a really long time

06:51.733 --> 06:53.779
before all of this,
and I assumed --

06:53.822 --> 06:55.737
It doesn't matter.
I'll be fine

06:55.781 --> 06:58.566
as long as I can speak to the --Shh! Hang on.

07:11.187 --> 07:13.755
That was her,
from last night.

07:13.799 --> 07:15.365
Did you see how she was
looking at us? She knows.

07:15.409 --> 07:17.193
We're fine.
No one knows we tried to leave,

07:17.237 --> 07:18.499
or believe me,
we'd be called int--

07:18.543 --> 07:21.110
Ezekiel's gone.

07:21.154 --> 07:22.460
In anticipation
of your next question,

07:22.503 --> 07:23.809
I looked everywhere,
asked around.

07:23.852 --> 07:25.419
No one's saying anything.
Someone took him.

07:25.463 --> 07:26.812
Someone knows what we did,

07:26.855 --> 07:28.248
and he's just the first
domino to fall.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.206
In anticipation
of your follow-up query,

07:30.250 --> 07:32.208
I don't know how I know. I only
know that I'm freaking out!

07:32.252 --> 07:34.776
It's probably 'cause
he told off the big guy.

07:34.820 --> 07:36.865
Oh, God. Why'd he tell off
the big guy?

07:36.909 --> 07:38.824
We should talk to them.
We should talk to them.

07:38.867 --> 07:41.566
We can come clean about who we
are and where we're really from.

07:41.609 --> 07:43.524
Eugene, for the last time,

07:43.568 --> 07:45.004
do not talk
to their law enforcement.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.962
Or if you find yourself
in a situation

07:47.006 --> 07:48.268
where you have to,
you stick to the story.

07:48.311 --> 07:49.399
Well, what do we do?

07:51.967 --> 07:54.230
Wait, what? Be cool.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.971
Ice! Ice!

07:56.015 --> 07:57.625
You've got
one of our people?

07:57.669 --> 07:59.148
What have you done
with him? I demand

07:59.192 --> 08:01.586
to know where he's been taken!Ma'am, calm down.

08:01.629 --> 08:03.370
I don't know
where your friend is.

08:03.413 --> 08:05.633
Then there's no reason for us
to continue this conversation.

08:05.677 --> 08:06.678
I'd like to speak
to somebody

08:06.721 --> 08:07.940
who can actually
give me answers.

08:07.983 --> 08:10.290
Who do you report to?

08:10.333 --> 08:12.205
You wanna speak
to my supervisor?

08:12.248 --> 08:14.947
That's right!
We wanna talk to the manager!

10:19.680 --> 10:21.116
Hey, Dog! Come here! Come here!

10:21.160 --> 10:23.075
Hey! Dog!

10:23.118 --> 10:24.729
Come here!

10:24.772 --> 10:27.949
Come here!

10:30.343 --> 10:31.431
Dog!

10:49.667 --> 10:51.625
I'm not sure
why you're here.

10:51.669 --> 10:53.496
You've already
been assessed.

10:55.803 --> 10:58.980
You think you've been
assessing me?

10:59.024 --> 11:00.634
No, dear.

11:00.678 --> 11:01.722
I've been assessing you.

11:04.682 --> 11:06.031
You don't know
anything about me --

11:06.074 --> 11:08.642
Your community's large
and organized.

11:08.686 --> 11:13.038
There's a bureaucracy,
and you're part of it.

11:13.081 --> 11:16.432
You probably had a job like this
before the world fell.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.608
If I had to guess, I'd say

11:18.652 --> 11:21.655
forensic psychologist.

11:21.699 --> 11:24.353
Perhaps you were an academic.

11:24.397 --> 11:27.226
Researcher?

11:27.269 --> 11:29.794
Your role is to assess threat
for your community.

11:29.837 --> 11:31.056
You ask about who we were

11:31.099 --> 11:33.014
because someone above you
has decided

11:33.058 --> 11:34.624
that that's a good
baseline position

11:34.668 --> 11:37.845
from which to judge who we are.

11:37.889 --> 11:41.240
So you poke around the dusty
corners of our brains,

11:41.283 --> 11:42.676
test our sense of boundaries

11:42.720 --> 11:46.636
with queries
about our toileting habits.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.421
You raked one of my people
over the coals

11:48.464 --> 11:50.728
due to a $2 bill,

11:50.771 --> 11:53.774
which makes me believe your
currency is the U.S. dollar,

11:53.818 --> 11:55.254
and that you need
to strictly control

11:55.297 --> 11:58.126
the amount in circulation.

11:58.170 --> 12:01.477
You use familiar money as
a powerful psychological tactic,

12:01.521 --> 12:05.220
because you know how desperately
people miss the old world.

12:07.092 --> 12:09.703
You want to understand
what we're capable of

12:09.747 --> 12:11.487
and whether we can
enhance your community

12:11.531 --> 12:13.707
or if we'd simply be
a drain on resources.

12:13.751 --> 12:18.712
But the truth of it is, you need
to justify your existence, too.

12:18.756 --> 12:21.541
Because isn't it almost
more valuable now

12:21.584 --> 12:23.108
to have someone
who can haul the trash

12:23.151 --> 12:24.892
and keep the streets
free from disease

12:24.936 --> 12:26.851
than someone who can write
endless lists of questions,

12:26.894 --> 12:30.724
given that at the end
of the day,

12:30.768 --> 12:32.204
you just need to rely
on your gut instinct

12:32.247 --> 12:33.901
about whether or not
the person across from you

12:33.945 --> 12:36.077
will or won't murder you
in your sleep?

12:39.385 --> 12:42.518
But you're both people
that follow the rules.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.477
I was a lawyer.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.088
I like rules.

12:47.132 --> 12:49.830
They bring order to the chaos.

12:52.615 --> 12:54.182
Which means you need me.

12:57.229 --> 13:00.319
I have reason to believe
my brother, a thoracic surgeon,

13:00.362 --> 13:04.105
is living at the Commonwealth
and is looking for me.

13:04.149 --> 13:06.586
I'd like expedited processing
for my group,

13:06.629 --> 13:10.285
as per your community's asylum
and immigration policies.

13:10.329 --> 13:12.157
Where did you
go to school again?

13:12.200 --> 13:14.333
Undergraduate at Oxford,
JD is from Harvard,

13:14.376 --> 13:16.117
which you very well know.
Would you like me to list

13:16.161 --> 13:17.640
my professional
credentials again?

13:23.385 --> 13:24.909
Mercer: Coffee?

13:31.654 --> 13:33.831
Can you stop moving? You're
taking my nerves over the edge

13:33.874 --> 13:35.833
to a proverbial 11
on a scale of 10.

13:35.876 --> 13:37.573
I can't help it.
We've been waiting and waiting,

13:37.617 --> 13:40.620
and now I have to pee
really, really bad.

13:40.663 --> 13:42.622
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
Be right back.

13:42.665 --> 13:45.407
No! No!
No more splitting up!

13:45.451 --> 13:48.193
Eugene. If that fine-ass dude
in the orange suit

13:48.236 --> 13:50.195
just walked in
with a coffee,

13:50.238 --> 13:52.371
things must be going good
for Yumiko, right?

13:52.414 --> 13:55.548
Maybe she'll be out
by the time I'm back.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.351
Uh, do you have
toilet paper?

14:19.354 --> 14:21.313
Well, shit!

14:21.356 --> 14:23.576
I'm excited!

15:19.675 --> 15:22.374
On my count. 3, 2, 1!

15:40.479 --> 15:42.046
Negan: Why don't you guys
handle that one?

15:42.089 --> 15:44.918
If you get tired out,
we'll take over.

15:48.791 --> 15:51.055
Alden: Is that the roof?

15:51.098 --> 15:52.404
Could be walkers.

15:52.447 --> 15:53.709
Shh!

15:56.060 --> 15:58.192
It's below us.
It's Morse code.

15:58.236 --> 16:01.021
It's SOS.

16:29.702 --> 16:31.095
I slipped.

16:31.138 --> 16:33.662
He saw,
and he left me to die.

16:33.706 --> 16:37.275
Negan: Yeah.

16:37.318 --> 16:40.321
Okay. So what?

16:40.365 --> 16:41.453
You're just admitting it?

16:41.496 --> 16:43.324
You tried to kill her!

16:43.368 --> 16:45.979
No, she was in trouble,
and I didn't help.

16:46.023 --> 16:48.503
There is a big difference.

16:50.331 --> 16:52.159
Okay, so who's gonna
help you now?

16:52.203 --> 16:54.161
Who in here's
got your back?

16:54.205 --> 16:57.686
Yeah, you don't need fingers
to count that number.

16:57.730 --> 17:00.907
She was just talking
about murdering me,

17:00.950 --> 17:02.604
sooner rather than later,

17:02.648 --> 17:05.172
and yet somehow,
I'm the big, old asshole

17:05.216 --> 17:07.653
'cause I didn't
risk my nuts for her?

17:09.742 --> 17:12.179
I have been a golden
goddamn asset

17:12.223 --> 17:13.920
for every single
one of you.

17:13.963 --> 17:15.835
Yeah, burning Hilltop,
that helped, huh?

17:15.878 --> 17:17.619
I killed Alpha, right?

17:17.663 --> 17:20.492
So, yeah, I was helpful.

17:20.535 --> 17:22.102
'Cause if I hadn't
done that,

17:22.146 --> 17:25.105
every person you know,
their skull would be on a spike.

17:27.890 --> 17:30.632
I did what needed to be done,
alright?

17:30.676 --> 17:32.112
I am trying.

17:34.201 --> 17:35.768
Yeah, okay. I'm not buying
a word of it.

17:35.811 --> 17:38.162
Same.

17:38.205 --> 17:39.815
Nod and it happens.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.904
We can get through the city
without him.

17:45.430 --> 17:48.172
Help! Help me! Help!

17:51.044 --> 17:53.786
-Later.
-Help!

17:53.829 --> 17:55.353
Help!

17:55.396 --> 17:58.182
Gage?! What happened?!

17:58.225 --> 18:00.227
We got lost in the tunnels!
Walkers are everywhere,

18:00.271 --> 18:01.881
they -- they might have --Negan: How'd you get in there?

18:01.924 --> 18:04.623
I-I got a door open
on the far end.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.929
Did you close it?Uh --

18:06.973 --> 18:09.062
Gage?
I --

18:09.106 --> 18:11.630
Hey, this one seems a bit
looser. Sasquatch, gimme a hand.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.022
We open that,
they'll all get in.

18:13.066 --> 18:14.154
He's right there!

18:14.198 --> 18:15.851
I know he is.

18:15.895 --> 18:19.028
The hell with you.

18:19.072 --> 18:20.421
Alden?

18:20.465 --> 18:21.857
Come on.

18:25.644 --> 18:27.646
Are you insane? Move!

18:27.689 --> 18:29.169
Move!

18:31.302 --> 18:33.478
Maggie?

18:33.521 --> 18:34.566
Maggie?!

18:34.609 --> 18:36.568
Open the door!

18:38.265 --> 18:40.528
Look, I'm sorry, okay?!
I'm sorry --

18:40.572 --> 18:42.791
I made -- I made
a mistake, and I'm sorry,

18:42.835 --> 18:44.097
but I just --

18:44.141 --> 18:45.359
I want another chance.
Okay?

18:45.403 --> 18:47.231
I won't do it again.
I won't do it again.

18:47.274 --> 18:49.581
I'll do better.
Please, I -- Please.

18:51.670 --> 18:52.932
Maggie, listen to me.

18:52.975 --> 18:55.848
We have time.
We can get that door open.

18:55.891 --> 18:58.590
Maggie! Maggie!

18:58.633 --> 19:02.289
We don't have the ammo
to clear them.

19:07.033 --> 19:09.557
Let it go.

19:12.299 --> 19:14.301
I'm sorry.

19:14.345 --> 19:15.781
I can't.

19:21.265 --> 19:23.745
Liar.

20:59.885 --> 21:02.975
Pardon me. I've been waiting
for my friend, Yumiko.

21:03.018 --> 21:04.672
She's in that room
right there.

21:04.716 --> 21:06.631
I was wondering if you might
be able to provide

21:06.674 --> 21:08.981
or procure for me an ETA
for when she might be done?

21:09.024 --> 21:10.678
No one's in there.

21:12.898 --> 21:16.728
But I watched my friend walk in
there with the two questioners,

21:16.771 --> 21:18.338
and I haven't seen her
or them walk out.

21:18.382 --> 21:19.426
If you could just check --

21:19.470 --> 21:21.602
No one is in there, sir.

21:21.646 --> 21:23.517
My other friend went
to use the ladies' room --

21:23.561 --> 21:24.605
What friend?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.741
I need you to leave.

21:29.784 --> 21:31.220
Now.

22:08.736 --> 22:09.607
What is it?

22:12.261 --> 22:14.829
Bad memories.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.617
Of what?

23:05.402 --> 23:07.447
You guys don't wanna
look at him.

23:07.491 --> 23:10.494
Why?

23:10.537 --> 23:12.974
Why won't you look at him?

23:13.018 --> 23:17.370
All that is, is the shell
of a man who died a coward.

23:17.414 --> 23:19.764
That's a hot take, Father.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.551
He was scared,

23:24.595 --> 23:28.120
but he didn't deserve
to die like that.

23:28.163 --> 23:31.340
In the worst way
imaginable.

23:31.384 --> 23:32.864
There are worse ways.

23:35.606 --> 23:37.346
A lot worse.

23:49.750 --> 23:54.494
Before I found
Elijah and his people...

23:54.538 --> 23:56.496
Hershel and I were alone
for a long time.

23:58.803 --> 24:03.851
One day, we came across
this frail old man

24:03.895 --> 24:07.333
who was kneeling
by a turned-over grocery cart.

24:09.466 --> 24:11.468
It was full of scavenged clothes

24:11.511 --> 24:12.773
he said were for
his sons and daughters,

24:12.817 --> 24:16.734
and could we help him
haul the cart back home?

24:19.476 --> 24:22.304
And he said he'd give us food
for our trouble.

24:24.829 --> 24:29.007
I knew that he was a liar.

24:29.050 --> 24:33.054
But I was starving,

24:33.098 --> 24:35.709
and soon, Hershel would be.

24:35.753 --> 24:37.624
So we followed him
back to his house.

24:37.668 --> 24:41.149
I held a knife to his throat
and reached in his pocket.

24:41.193 --> 24:45.414
I pulled out the chloroform rag
he was gonna use on me.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.592
I stuffed it in his mouth.

24:50.637 --> 24:52.639
And then we went
inside the house,

24:52.683 --> 24:56.861
and I locked my little boy
in a room,

24:56.904 --> 24:58.776
and I went
and searched the house.

25:04.216 --> 25:09.264
There were these three...

25:09.308 --> 25:14.226
deformed --

25:14.269 --> 25:16.794
I wouldn't call them men.

25:20.493 --> 25:24.976
They came after me.

25:25.019 --> 25:28.196
But I handled them.

25:28.240 --> 25:31.765
And then the house was quiet,

25:31.809 --> 25:33.854
except for this thudding sound

25:33.898 --> 25:37.205
that was coming from upstairs
in the attic.

25:39.947 --> 25:43.516
And I thought maybe they had
people tied up up there

25:43.560 --> 25:45.779
that were trying to get free.

25:49.522 --> 25:55.484
So I walked to a door
at the end of this hallway.

25:55.528 --> 25:56.660
And I opened it,
and I looked up,

25:56.703 --> 26:00.141
and there was a set of stairs.

26:00.185 --> 26:05.364
At the top of the stairs,
there's this shadow

26:05.407 --> 26:09.673
writhing and rocking.

26:09.716 --> 26:12.066
I thought it was an animal.

26:14.808 --> 26:19.030
Then all of a sudden,
it fell down the stairs,

26:19.073 --> 26:22.686
and it came right at my feet.

26:22.729 --> 26:25.384
It was a walker

26:25.427 --> 26:27.865
that used to be a woman.

26:29.606 --> 26:33.479
Her arms and her legs

26:33.522 --> 26:35.873
had been cut off,

26:35.916 --> 26:39.137
stitched up.

26:39.180 --> 26:43.054
Her eyes gouged out.

26:43.097 --> 26:46.448
No tongue.

26:46.492 --> 26:49.582
And she was wheezing

26:49.626 --> 26:52.933
through an open, cauterized gash
in her throat

26:52.977 --> 26:56.676
where her vocal cords
had been ripped out.

26:59.984 --> 27:04.597
And her belly was round
and full.

27:04.641 --> 27:07.905
And whatever was inside of there
was trying to get out.

27:09.646 --> 27:12.736
And I went upstairs, and there
were three more just like her.

27:15.042 --> 27:17.131
But their hearts
were still beating.

27:20.395 --> 27:22.746
And do you know
the first thing I thought?

27:24.617 --> 27:29.578
The very first thing
that crossed my mind?

27:29.622 --> 27:31.972
"If they're alive,

27:32.016 --> 27:34.583
there must be food here."

27:37.195 --> 27:40.198
So I took care of them.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.374
And then I found the food.

27:42.417 --> 27:45.246
Lots of it.

27:45.290 --> 27:49.729
And Hershel and I filled
the cart with it, and we left.

27:59.086 --> 28:02.916
I don't feel anything
when I tell you that.

28:05.527 --> 28:08.792
Do you understand me?

28:08.835 --> 28:11.925
Because that
is what's out there.

28:14.711 --> 28:18.062
And seeing it, I lost something.

28:18.105 --> 28:22.240
And I don't think
it's a bad thing that I did.

28:22.283 --> 28:25.156
Because it has made things
so much clearer.

28:27.288 --> 28:31.466
What we have in Alexandria,

28:31.510 --> 28:35.035
what we had in Hilltop

28:35.079 --> 28:38.822
and in Meridian --

28:38.865 --> 28:41.172
it's rare.

28:41.215 --> 28:43.217
It has to be.

28:46.090 --> 28:50.007
Compared to everything
that's out there.

28:50.050 --> 28:52.792
Because if it isn't --

28:52.836 --> 28:56.448
It means we were lucky.

28:56.491 --> 28:59.625
It means that nobody
has it figured out.

29:02.019 --> 29:03.890
Nobody ever did,

29:03.934 --> 29:06.632
and nobody ever will.

30:34.502 --> 30:36.330
Dog?

30:49.648 --> 30:52.172
Daryl, help me.

31:31.168 --> 31:32.604
How bad is it?

31:32.647 --> 31:34.649
It ain't good.

31:36.521 --> 31:37.826
You went topside?

31:39.872 --> 31:42.744
Bad idea.

31:42.788 --> 31:45.965
I lost Gage.

31:46.009 --> 31:48.272
Where's the ammo bag?

31:48.315 --> 31:50.491
Where's the ammo bag?

31:50.535 --> 31:53.190
I lost that, too.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.456
Don't -- Stop.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.197
Don't waste that on me.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.199
Here. It's all I got.

32:09.075 --> 32:12.600
Tell my kids
I didn't die a coward.

32:38.931 --> 32:41.238
Frost: It's blocked.

35:05.251 --> 35:07.253
Hey!

35:07.297 --> 35:08.602
They're coming in
from this side!

35:22.616 --> 35:24.183
Back up!

36:03.266 --> 36:05.485
Daryl: Shh, boy.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.285
Negan: Come on, little more!

37:07.982 --> 37:11.290
Hurry!

37:11.334 --> 37:13.161
Come on, go!

37:18.166 --> 37:20.560
Get behind something!

38:51.259 --> 38:54.219
What have you done
with my traveling companions?

38:54.262 --> 38:56.177
They're being processed.

38:58.266 --> 39:03.010
"Processed" as in
a-administratively?

39:03.054 --> 39:06.144
Processed as in bologna
or other meat stuffs?

39:06.187 --> 39:08.146
This inquiring mind
needs to know.

39:10.322 --> 39:12.890
I want to see them.

39:12.933 --> 39:16.415
You like feeling nervous?

39:16.459 --> 39:17.460
No.

39:17.503 --> 39:20.941
Only one thing
gets my heart up.

39:20.985 --> 39:23.161
When I'm out there,

39:23.204 --> 39:26.207
battling the dead.

39:26.251 --> 39:29.950
The magenta swarms.

39:29.994 --> 39:32.126
It's just...

39:32.170 --> 39:35.652
pumping, every time.

39:37.480 --> 39:40.483
But not in a bad way.

39:44.661 --> 39:46.837
Here. Mop up.

39:55.411 --> 39:57.282
I-I think that --

39:57.325 --> 40:00.154
You can't lie for shit.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.895
I --
So don't lie.

40:01.939 --> 40:03.506
Okay.

40:03.549 --> 40:07.074
I wasn't g-going to.

40:07.118 --> 40:07.858
You weren't?

40:07.901 --> 40:09.468
No.

40:09.512 --> 40:11.078
That makes me like you.

40:13.429 --> 40:15.518
Keep doing that,
it'll help you.

40:15.561 --> 40:17.520
If you don't --

40:21.306 --> 40:22.481
You get me?

40:25.223 --> 40:27.355
Use your words.

40:27.399 --> 40:29.053
Y-Yes.

40:29.096 --> 40:30.141
Yes, sir.

40:30.184 --> 40:31.795
Good.

40:31.838 --> 40:34.232
Now.

40:34.275 --> 40:37.583
I know you're holding back.

40:37.627 --> 40:39.324
Youknow
you're holding back.

40:39.367 --> 40:41.544
I'm going to give you
two questions.

40:41.587 --> 40:46.070
You're going to give me
two answers. Truthful ones.

40:46.113 --> 40:47.724
You do that?

40:47.767 --> 40:50.422
You get to go.

40:50.466 --> 40:53.338
You get to see
your friends again.

40:53.381 --> 40:55.340
Everything will be okay.

40:57.081 --> 40:58.909
It's that simple.

41:03.783 --> 41:05.742
Where is your settlement?

41:05.785 --> 41:07.483
And why were you
at that train station?

41:10.181 --> 41:13.140
Mm, Eugene.

41:13.184 --> 41:15.708
If you lie.

41:15.752 --> 41:17.667
I'll know.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.279
O-Okey-dokey.

41:25.413 --> 41:28.721
You're right.

41:28.765 --> 41:32.595
I have been holding
something back.

41:32.638 --> 41:35.380
Frankly, I wanted
to speak up before this,

41:35.423 --> 41:37.556
but I was afraid of what
my friends would think.

41:39.906 --> 41:42.692
I haven't always been
the most emotional fella,

41:42.735 --> 41:47.523
but my 10,000-plus hours
of death, loss, and fear

41:47.566 --> 41:50.177
have opened me up a little bit.

41:50.221 --> 41:56.662
In the course of our travels,
I found this radio.

41:56.706 --> 41:59.491
Night after night,
I would speak into the void,

41:59.535 --> 42:03.277
holding onto a-a "what if,"

42:03.321 --> 42:06.454
as fools are wont to do,
and I am nothing if not a fool.

42:12.286 --> 42:14.593
Then one night,

42:14.637 --> 42:18.336
a voice came back
from said void.

42:18.379 --> 42:20.991
A beautiful voice.

42:23.559 --> 42:26.257
We got to talking, and she...

42:28.694 --> 42:32.089
...was not repulsed
by my musings.

42:34.004 --> 42:38.225
We spoke of train museums
and ice cream cones.

42:38.269 --> 42:40.793
We laughed.

42:42.534 --> 42:43.883
We sang Iron Maiden.

42:45.755 --> 42:49.019
And then we wanted to meet.

42:49.062 --> 42:52.457
So I got my friends

42:52.500 --> 42:54.894
to go to that train yard
under the guise

42:54.938 --> 42:56.940
of asking whoever showed up
for help for us three,

42:56.983 --> 42:59.420
because I knew
they wouldn't go otherwise.

43:01.945 --> 43:05.905
But all I was thinking about
was Stephanie.

43:05.949 --> 43:09.735
So yes, I lied.

43:09.779 --> 43:11.911
I've been lying this whole time,
because I'm afraid to lose

43:11.955 --> 43:15.175
the three friends I have
in this world.

43:15.219 --> 43:17.569
And I lied to Stephanie about
being from a large settlement

43:17.613 --> 43:19.963
because I was afraid that maybe,

43:20.006 --> 43:22.356
she was not
who she said she was.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.751
That maybe she was
a femme fatale,

43:25.795 --> 43:27.884
laying a trap
for a lonely heart.

43:30.234 --> 43:33.063
My track record in the romantic
realm is spotty at best.

43:33.106 --> 43:36.544
I'm not one for whom
any relationships come easy,

43:36.588 --> 43:39.069
particularly those
with the fairer sex.

43:42.246 --> 43:45.728
And I am, in fact, a virgin.

43:45.771 --> 43:48.687
Even though I have, uh,
observed the act

43:48.731 --> 43:50.863
far more times
than I care to admit.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.956
Thank you for holding back
your titters.

43:59.176 --> 44:01.395
I was -- I was hoping

44:01.439 --> 44:03.833
that after a suitable period
of courtship,

44:03.876 --> 44:07.619
that Stephanie might be the one
to change my unenviable status,

44:07.663 --> 44:09.752
because deep down, I was hoping
that maybe, in fact,

44:09.795 --> 44:12.189
she was my One True Love.

44:12.232 --> 44:14.582
And now I've been forced to
admit that in this room,

44:14.626 --> 44:16.672
and I'm humiliated by it.

44:17.803 --> 44:21.589
And...

44:21.633 --> 44:23.243
I'm afraid
that if Stephanie finds out

44:23.287 --> 44:25.158
that I wasn't honest
with her, either,

44:25.202 --> 44:28.379
that she might want to have
nothing to do with me anymore.

44:30.773 --> 44:35.691
So here I am...

44:35.734 --> 44:39.651
very relieved
to get that off my chest.

44:39.695 --> 44:41.653
Because everything else
I've said up to this point

44:41.697 --> 44:43.786
has been the goddamn truth.

45:32.704 --> 45:34.706
Eugene!

45:47.588 --> 45:49.677
Ezekiel:
It's okay, man. Let it out.

45:53.333 --> 45:56.336
I thought --
W-Where'd they take you?

45:56.380 --> 45:57.947
An infirmary.

45:57.990 --> 46:01.733
A medic steamed my face, gave me
this nasty herbal cough syrup,

46:01.777 --> 46:04.301
and I slept.

46:04.344 --> 46:06.564
They spiked the cough syrup?

46:06.607 --> 46:08.696
No, no. They took the lantern
out of my room,

46:08.740 --> 46:10.002
and I fell asleep.

46:10.046 --> 46:11.743
Medic checked on me
a couple of times,

46:11.787 --> 46:14.311
and then they brought Yumiko
to visit, and then they took us

46:14.354 --> 46:16.879
to a holding room with Princess,
and then they brought us here.

46:16.922 --> 46:19.011
Yeah. Thank God you're here,
too. We were worried.

46:29.587 --> 46:34.461
Pursuant to Section 114A of the
New Articles of Perpetual Union,

46:34.505 --> 46:37.334
in deference to traditions
established by Article 1,

46:37.377 --> 46:38.901
Section 8
of the Legacy Constitution

46:38.944 --> 46:41.947
and Article 14
of the Legacy UDHR,

46:41.991 --> 46:44.515
you have successfully completed
initial processing

46:44.558 --> 46:47.083
in consideration
for asylum and citizenship

46:47.126 --> 46:49.476
in these united townships.

46:51.391 --> 46:53.393
When you walk through
these doors,

46:53.437 --> 46:56.309
you'll be escorted
to orientation.

46:56.353 --> 46:58.834
By a beat cop.

46:58.877 --> 47:01.271
Welcome to the Commonwealth.

47:07.886 --> 47:10.889
I went to West Point, asshole.

47:14.284 --> 47:16.503
I don't get it. What the hell
changed? Why did they all --

47:16.547 --> 47:18.505
Don't question it.
We're in.

47:27.993 --> 47:32.345
Um, which one of you
is Eugene?

47:36.349 --> 47:38.786
Hi.

47:38.830 --> 47:41.354
I'm Stephanie.

48:47.246 --> 48:48.726
What is that?

48:48.769 --> 48:52.295
It's a letter from this kid
to his parents.

48:52.338 --> 48:54.210
It's from back before.

48:54.253 --> 48:56.473
You found it?

48:56.516 --> 48:58.431
Yeah, down in the tunnels.

48:58.475 --> 49:01.957
See anything else
down there?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.437
Nah.
Just the same stuff you saw.

49:09.094 --> 49:10.704
We heading out?

49:10.748 --> 49:13.577
We need to take
a detour first.

49:13.620 --> 49:14.926
Arbor Hills.

49:14.970 --> 49:17.973
What's there?Hidden supply depot.

49:18.016 --> 49:20.192
Georgie set 'em up all over,
in case we ran into any trouble

49:20.236 --> 49:23.282
when we were out
looking for survivors.

49:23.326 --> 49:27.243
It has ammo, food, weapons.

49:30.159 --> 49:32.509
Rest up there, restock,
and then head to Meridian.

49:32.552 --> 49:35.294
Radio tower
marks that neighborhood.

49:37.949 --> 49:40.647
You know where that is?

49:40.691 --> 49:43.041
Yeah. Come on.

49:43.085 --> 49:46.088
Daryl:
Come on. Come on, boy.

50:23.081 --> 50:24.996
Well, this place
sure has gone to shit

50:25.040 --> 50:27.520
since the last time I was here.

50:35.050 --> 50:37.530
Let's double back.
We can cut through --

50:40.229 --> 50:42.100
Aah! Aah!

51:01.946 --> 51:03.339
Run!

51:03.382 --> 51:05.210
Gabriel:
You tried to kill my friends.

51:05.254 --> 51:07.821
Man: Don't be scared.
I'm not.

51:07.865 --> 51:11.564
Negan: Things change.
You need to rethink your plan.

51:11.608 --> 51:15.133
The plan doesn't change.
We need that food.

51:16.003 --> 51:18.093
The walls
are about to fail.

51:18.136 --> 51:19.572
Carol: If we don't get
those horses,

51:19.616 --> 51:21.139
we're all gonna starve
to death.

51:21.183 --> 51:22.880
Man: I thought you were
a man of God.

51:22.923 --> 51:24.577
God isn't here anymore.

51:25.230 --> 51:27.145
No! No!

51:37.764 --> 51:41.028
Kang: When we start, we see that
Maggie, she's down there,

51:41.072 --> 51:42.987
she's fighting the walkers.

51:45.642 --> 51:48.558
For our heroes, you're not
a hero unless you fight

51:48.601 --> 51:50.864
through things
and you survive things,

51:50.908 --> 51:54.041
and Maggie is a survivor.
She has been through a lot.

51:54.085 --> 51:58.263
Putting her in situations where
she's really just having to be

51:58.307 --> 52:02.180
strong and smart -- that's
always a good place to put

52:02.224 --> 52:03.921
our heroes like Maggie.

52:03.964 --> 52:07.664
So, we just felt like it was
important to start the episode

52:07.707 --> 52:11.276
on her like that because you
just see, like, how determined

52:11.320 --> 52:14.192
she is to get through
her mission.

52:20.894 --> 52:25.638
Daryl, in a lot of ways, is in
this very atmospheric part

52:25.682 --> 52:29.512
of the story, but it's all
important to kind of

52:29.555 --> 52:32.732
remind us of stakes and what's
out there in the world,

52:32.776 --> 52:36.867
and we liked this idea of
showing this mural.

52:36.910 --> 52:40.523
We wanted to touch on these
themes of high and low class,

52:40.566 --> 52:42.916
which go throughout the season.

52:42.960 --> 52:46.529
At the top of the mural, you'll
see this family wearing crowns

52:46.572 --> 52:50.185
and then Daryl scans his
flashlight down and you see,

52:50.228 --> 52:52.752
it's the same family and they're
still wearing the crowns,

52:52.796 --> 52:55.059
but they're now homeless
and they're looking for food.

52:55.102 --> 52:56.930
And you see people who are in
crowns

52:56.974 --> 52:58.541
that are being torn apart,

52:58.584 --> 53:00.456
not by zombies,
but by other humans,

53:00.499 --> 53:03.763
and so we were trying to tell
the story of what happened

53:03.807 --> 53:07.332
in these subway tunnels,
and the backstory of it is that

53:07.376 --> 53:09.900
there was this massive class
struggle that happened.

53:09.943 --> 53:13.469
People wound up being murdered
and stuffed in bags,

53:13.512 --> 53:16.950
and so you see a mixing of
people who are homeless

53:16.994 --> 53:19.388
along with people who had a lot
of money.

53:19.431 --> 53:22.565
You know, there's a guy in
a suit with just a suitcase

53:22.608 --> 53:24.697
full of cash that he tried to
run away with,

53:24.741 --> 53:26.960
but you now think, like,
"Well, that was useless."

53:27.004 --> 53:29.485
And then you even see
a different context for money,

53:29.528 --> 53:32.531
because he finds this bag of
things left behind

53:32.575 --> 53:34.664
by children who were
forced to be

53:34.707 --> 53:36.492
almost adults in their own right

53:36.535 --> 53:40.626
and you see something that was a
bill that became just note paper

53:40.670 --> 53:43.325
for this child to leave
a message to parents,

53:43.368 --> 53:45.762
and clearly, they never found
each other.

53:45.805 --> 53:48.504
You know, there was a bunny that
Maggie saw on the tracks,

53:48.547 --> 53:51.507
and then you see the photo of
these two beautiful children,

53:51.550 --> 53:53.726
and the daughter had
the stuffed bunny,

53:53.770 --> 53:56.729
so they either didn't make it or
at the very least,

53:56.773 --> 53:58.818
they had to run and leave that
toy behind.

53:58.862 --> 54:01.386
So, for Daryl as he's kind of
going through,

54:01.430 --> 54:05.347
it's a reminder for him that
the mission they're on

54:05.390 --> 54:10.656
is to prevent their people from
winding up in a place like this.

54:10.700 --> 54:14.312
Keeping them afloat is worth
the sacrifice for our heroes.

54:18.490 --> 54:20.579
Some of the things that we love
about Princess

54:20.623 --> 54:23.974
is that she is just this bright,
shining light

54:24.017 --> 54:26.803
in the middle of
this dark world.

54:26.846 --> 54:29.414
She is authentically who she is.

54:29.458 --> 54:33.723
She has been through so much
trauma, but is looking to

54:33.766 --> 54:35.290
connect with people.

54:35.333 --> 54:38.031
You know, we claim this
character as having ADHD,

54:38.075 --> 54:40.251
and we've tried to kind of be
true to some of

54:40.295 --> 54:43.385
the mental health struggles that
sometimes accompany that,

54:43.428 --> 54:45.517
because you just think in
a different way,

54:45.561 --> 54:48.041
and sometimes, people don't
accept that.

54:48.085 --> 54:50.783
But, you know, we've seen that
she's incredibly observant,

54:50.827 --> 54:54.004
and that because she can sort of
hyper-focus on things,

54:54.047 --> 54:56.702
she notices things that a lot of
people miss,

54:56.746 --> 54:59.879
and so that in and of itself
becomes this thing

54:59.923 --> 55:04.057
that helps our people almost
escape in the first episode.

55:04.101 --> 55:06.799
I also think, like, you know,
she's not shy.

55:06.843 --> 55:08.323
She just kind of was like,

55:08.366 --> 55:09.585
"Well, I gotta go to
the bathroom,

55:09.628 --> 55:11.282
so I'm just going to talk to
this guy."

55:11.326 --> 55:14.372
Do you have
toilet paper?

55:14.416 --> 55:16.069
I'm excited.

55:16.113 --> 55:19.899
The fact that she is somebody
that is not afraid to

55:19.943 --> 55:22.685
try to connect with people is
something that's going to

55:22.728 --> 55:25.296
take her really, really far,
at the end of the day.

55:25.340 --> 55:26.863
You want to speak to
my supervisor?

55:26.906 --> 55:29.213
That's right!
We wanna talk to the manager.

55:31.607 --> 55:33.652
When Maggie comes back in
the train car

55:33.696 --> 55:37.003
and says, "I slipped
and he saw me do it

55:37.047 --> 55:39.266
and he left me to die."
And he's like...

55:39.310 --> 55:41.921
Okay. So what?

55:41.965 --> 55:44.924
That's just Negan. I don't think
he feels a lot of shame

55:44.968 --> 55:49.320
about, like, the things that
he does as a survivor,

55:49.364 --> 55:52.845
and I think he's always been
oddly a straight shooter.

55:52.889 --> 55:55.718
He pretty much tells you who
he is and what he thinks,

55:55.761 --> 55:58.764
and he tells every person what
he thinks about them.

55:58.808 --> 56:02.028
Like, a lot of times -- he can
be a real bully at times,

56:02.072 --> 56:03.552
like, to people and just kind of

56:03.595 --> 56:04.814
call them names
and things like that.

56:04.857 --> 56:06.729
I'll tell you why
I'm here, man-tits.

56:06.772 --> 56:10.515
I'm real close to shoving
a gag in your mouth.

56:10.559 --> 56:12.082
Well, why don't you
get up

56:12.125 --> 56:14.171
on your little tippy toes
and try.

56:14.214 --> 56:16.956
There's definitely no
not knowing

56:17.000 --> 56:18.915
where you stand with Negan.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.351
Hey, this one seems
a bit looser!

56:20.395 --> 56:22.571
Sasquatch,
gimme a hand!

56:22.614 --> 56:26.096
In the scene with Gage,
we felt that it was

56:26.139 --> 56:29.621
really important to come to
a point in this story

56:29.665 --> 56:33.146
where a horrible decision had to
be made.

56:33.190 --> 56:34.931
Gage is so young.

56:34.974 --> 56:37.499
I mean, the guy is kind of
a jerk.

56:37.542 --> 56:39.936
He was part of the group that
was bullying Lydia

56:39.979 --> 56:42.547
at Alexandria.
He was sort of complicit

56:42.591 --> 56:44.854
in this attack on her.

56:44.897 --> 56:47.683
But we thought like, you know,
somebody like that,

56:47.726 --> 56:50.337
who's still kind of young
and growing --

56:50.381 --> 56:52.905
he's out on this mission because
he wants to try to

56:52.949 --> 56:54.951
help and try to redeem
something,

56:54.994 --> 56:58.520
but he made some bad choices,
once again.

56:58.563 --> 57:00.260
Gage.

57:00.304 --> 57:02.088
He took our supplies.

57:02.132 --> 57:04.177
He runs off at
the first opportunity

57:04.221 --> 57:06.092
and he takes supplies
with him.

57:06.136 --> 57:09.182
When he comes back,
our people would have let him

57:09.226 --> 57:13.491
back in if they could have,
but I think when they look at

57:13.535 --> 57:16.581
the math of, like, you've got
a herd of zombies

57:16.625 --> 57:18.757
coming after you,
you were a coward,

57:18.801 --> 57:21.978
if we let you in,
now we're going to use our ammo,

57:22.021 --> 57:26.025
we're going to use our energy.
You might die anyway

57:26.069 --> 57:29.028
and we might all die.
I think that Maggie kind of

57:29.072 --> 57:31.466
looks at that and she thinks
like a general and goes,

57:31.509 --> 57:33.250
like, "You're an acceptable loss

57:33.293 --> 57:35.470
in order for the rest of us
to go on."

57:35.513 --> 57:39.256
But that doesn't make
the decision any nicer

57:39.299 --> 57:43.216
or easier, because he also takes
his moment to kind of say,

57:43.260 --> 57:46.350
"'F' you. Like, if you're going
to do this, then you're going to

57:46.393 --> 57:48.439
watch me turn in front of you.

57:48.483 --> 57:49.701
Like, that's what's going to
happen."

57:56.447 --> 58:01.583
An important moment in the arc
between Maggie and Negan is,

58:01.626 --> 58:04.542
there's this moment where
they feel like

58:04.586 --> 58:06.283
they're just in real trouble,

58:06.326 --> 58:08.024
and maybe they're all going to
die,

58:08.067 --> 58:12.245
and Maggie hands Negan a gun
that she has on her.

58:12.289 --> 58:16.641
Maggie really is just kind of,
like, cold, hard leader

58:16.685 --> 58:20.079
at that point.
Right then, he's just an asset.

58:20.123 --> 58:22.429
The mission has become more
important

58:22.473 --> 58:26.129
than any one individual
or any one dynamic

58:26.172 --> 58:29.698
that exists between them,
and that is true even for her.

58:29.741 --> 58:33.397
And so, when he gives it back,
maybe there is at least

58:33.440 --> 58:37.619
this tiny, tiny bit of trust
that has passed back and forth

58:37.662 --> 58:40.404
between them, and that's going
to just be part of

58:40.447 --> 58:43.276
the shifting sands that they're
on as they're going through

58:43.320 --> 58:45.844
this mission together.

58:45.888 --> 58:48.673
The final scene with the Reapers
shows, like,

58:48.717 --> 58:52.285
"A", they've got the hanging
bodies and all kinds of

58:52.329 --> 58:54.113
things -- like, there is
definitely sort of

58:54.157 --> 58:57.726
this "Apocalypse Now" type of
vibe to them.

58:57.769 --> 59:00.816
This element of,
"Don't mess with us.

59:00.859 --> 59:02.818
Our territory
is our territory.

59:02.861 --> 59:06.822
Don't cross, but if you do,
there's going to be a problem."

59:06.865 --> 59:09.564
And just the way that
they're marching forward,

59:09.607 --> 59:11.914
you see this sort of boldness
of, like,

59:11.957 --> 59:14.699
"We're not afraid of coming to
meet you."

59:14.743 --> 59:17.833
They are very, very, very
formidable and they know it.
