00:11.679 --> 00:14.780
Boy: 'twas the night
before christmas,

00:14.782 --> 00:17.049
And all through the house,

00:17.051 --> 00:19.284
Not a creature was stirring,

00:19.286 --> 00:20.986
Not even a mouse.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.826
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care...

00:31.198 --> 00:37.669
In hopes that saint nicholas
soon would be there.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.872
And he was. Right there.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.541
In my house.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.010
The real santa. Alive.

00:45.012 --> 00:49.281
That's right, the bearded one
really exists.

00:49.283 --> 00:52.017
But I'm getting a little
ahead of my story here.

00:52.019 --> 00:55.220
Let's go back a little earlier.

00:55.222 --> 00:59.591
'twas the <i> day</i> before christmas,

00:59.593 --> 01:01.093
And all through the pad,

01:01.095 --> 01:02.928
Everyone was at home,

01:02.930 --> 01:05.096
Even workaholic ol' dad.

01:05.099 --> 01:08.634
And mom in the kitchen
cooking still like a rookie,

01:08.636 --> 01:12.738
Scorching the backs
of the gingerbread cookies.

01:12.740 --> 01:17.242
And then, there's my sister,
a parents' delight.

01:17.244 --> 01:22.881
Annoying, bad-tempered,
and obnoxiously bright.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.716
And precious little peter,

01:24.718 --> 01:26.852
The family loves him the most.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.987
If he comes into my room
one more time,

01:28.989 --> 01:30.656
He'll be toast.

01:30.658 --> 01:34.159
Then there is me,
handsome and true.

01:34.161 --> 01:37.930
The best at everything
that anyone can do.

01:37.932 --> 01:41.767
Intelligent, witty,
there is no doubt.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.236
Kind, compassionate.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.971
Peter, get out.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.140
But, danny...

01:48.142 --> 01:50.742
What's the rule
about coming in my room?

01:50.744 --> 01:52.744
Never come in your room.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.912
But dad wants to know

01:53.914 --> 01:55.914
When you want
to decorate
the tree.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.784
I want to
decorate the tree
on christmas eve,

01:58.786 --> 01:59.952
Like every other year

01:59.953 --> 02:01.119
We've ever decorated
christmas trees

02:01.122 --> 02:02.921
In this family.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.023
But it <i> is</i> christmas eve.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.160
It's not christmas eve, doofus.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.895
That's tomorrow.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.297
Now close the door.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.000
Ok, whatever you say.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.304
Christmas eve.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.842
Christmas eve?

02:31.352 --> 02:32.784
Oops.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.189
Danny: There's a problem
with christmas,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.191
When your wallet is light.

02:39.193 --> 02:42.194
You can't stand your father,

02:42.196 --> 02:43.929
And your sister is just...

02:43.931 --> 02:45.797
A little too bright.

02:45.799 --> 02:51.136
You must turn to the one
who gets you out of your funk,

02:51.138 --> 02:53.372
Just sell your little brother

02:53.374 --> 02:55.941
A whole bunch of... Junk.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.016
Hey, sweetie.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.083
What's all that stuff?

03:05.085 --> 03:07.052
I've been christmas shopping.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.188
Shopping? Where?

03:09.190 --> 03:11.190
Danny's room.

03:11.192 --> 03:15.093
Daniel francis wrigley,
get out here now!

03:16.931 --> 03:18.096
Uh-oh.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.769
What about my
no-returns policy?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.204
Danny, you are not allowed

03:25.206 --> 03:27.206
To shake down
your little brother.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.273
He wasn't shaking me.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.942
He was being nice.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.211
Pete, he was taking
advantage of you,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.179
And he ought to be
ashamed of himself.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.480
Don't hold your breath.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.216
Stick a sock in it, katy.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.250
Danny.
What?

03:38.252 --> 03:41.220
Ok.<i> Please</i>
stick a sock in it.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.489
But, mom, I want all that stuff.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.092
See?

03:47.094 --> 03:48.293
Who's the victim here?

03:48.295 --> 03:50.095
He's not complaining.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.364
Come on.
It's just like
uncle nick says.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.968
I'm just helping him
share the wealth.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.502
Uncle nick, huh?

03:57.504 --> 04:00.105
It's too bad it's always
someone else's wealth

04:00.107 --> 04:02.107
That uncle nick
is so eager to share.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.176
No. Uncle nick
is the bomb.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.444
He is, ok?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.179
You just don't understand him.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.181
Mom: Danny, nick's got
a lot of good qualities,

04:09.183 --> 04:12.317
Yes, but he's not exactly
a good role model for you.
All right?

04:12.319 --> 04:13.485
Dad:
He's a con artist.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.254
Danny: He's
an entrepreneur.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.288
Right. Ok.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.290
He's a con artist with a laptop.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.192
It's not a matter
of the presents.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.461
It's a matter of
taking advantage of
your little brother.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.930
He looks up to you
the same way you
look up to nick.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.865
Peter: Aah!

04:28.035 --> 04:31.003
Oh, peter.
What are you doing?

04:33.207 --> 04:35.807
You said it was family money.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.309
Ho ho, oh, buddy.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.379
Danny's our family,
and he needs it.

04:40.381 --> 04:44.082
I was just sharing the wealth.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.384
Ok, that's weird.

04:45.386 --> 04:48.053
I can see <i>his</i> lips moving,

04:48.055 --> 04:51.356
But I can hear danny talking.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.365
It's ok, danny.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.367
You can shake me down
if you want to.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.802
I like it.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.203
Do me a favor, pete.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.105
Just don't, like, uh,

05:07.107 --> 05:10.175
Say that in front of anyone...

05:10.177 --> 05:12.077
Ever again.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.412
Ok?

05:18.185 --> 05:22.521
Uncle nick is by far
the coolest person
in this family.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.489
I don't even know how he and dad

05:24.491 --> 05:26.458
Could be from the same parents.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.127
You're the coolest, danny.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.897
I appreciate that, little dude,

05:31.899 --> 05:34.232
But, um...

05:34.234 --> 05:36.368
I got a long way to go

05:36.370 --> 05:39.004
To measure up to uncle nick.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.241
I bet he's someplace
right this minute

05:43.243 --> 05:47.112
Making a major
big-bucks business deal.

05:47.114 --> 05:51.216
He probably has 'em
begging for mercy.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.518
I'm begging you,
please don't hurt me.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.555
Man: All right, nick.
Where's your office?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.256
But this <i> is</i> my office.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.759
Second man: Well, then,

06:00.760 --> 06:03.261
Where are all
your highly-skilled
employees, nick?

06:03.263 --> 06:04.463
Out to lunch?

06:06.216 --> 06:07.966
Ok, it's just me...
Me and my computer.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.935
What are you guys
gonna do with me?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.470
Who are you guys?

06:12.339 --> 06:13.605
We guys are the guys

06:13.607 --> 06:16.074
That got swindled by
your phony website,
nick.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.077
Yeah. I guess the name
should've tipped us off...

06:19.079 --> 06:21.546
Realfastdough.Com.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.417
You two knuckleheads?

06:25.419 --> 06:27.619
Ohh! Oh, come on, bill.
Let me slap him.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.021
Let me give him some
of that mama's kitchen
discipline.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.356
No, harry.
No, no, no, no.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.225
Slapping him will not get back

06:33.227 --> 06:35.894
The $30,000 he bilked us out of

06:35.896 --> 06:38.563
With his bogus little
business offering.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.500
How did I get tied up?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.935
Both: We ask
the questions here.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.438
Where's our money?

06:46.440 --> 06:48.573
Fine. I'll tell you.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.910
First I put your money
into a safe long-term cd,

06:51.912 --> 06:55.313
Then I shifted the capital
into a real up-and-coming ipo...

06:55.315 --> 06:57.315
Made a killing...

06:57.317 --> 06:59.918
Flipped it the same day
into some mutual funds,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.186
Blue chip stocks...

07:01.188 --> 07:03.588
Nick, please!
Where is it?

07:03.590 --> 07:07.659
Well, there is
a measure of risk
in every investment.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.661
It's gone.
I ju...

07:10.664 --> 07:12.264
So, nick...

07:12.266 --> 07:15.567
You did it all here
on your nifty little
laptop, huh?

07:15.569 --> 07:18.336
Oh, that's nice,
very, very nice.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.671
Please be careful of lappy.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.673
It's very sensitive.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.674
Sensitive?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.275
Nick's got a sensitive computer.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.277
Ho ha ha ha!

07:24.278 --> 07:25.410
You ever see what happens

07:25.412 --> 07:27.012
When you pour a hot cup of cocoa

07:27.014 --> 07:28.413
Over a sensitive computer, nick?

07:28.415 --> 07:29.448
It ain't pretty.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.249
No, don't, not to lappy!

07:31.251 --> 07:33.418
My whole life is on that thing!

07:33.420 --> 07:36.388
All my account numbers
and contacts, businesses.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.423
All your scams, you mean, nick.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.425
What scams?
Ooh!

07:39.426 --> 07:40.992
Ok!

07:40.994 --> 07:43.261
Ok. Those, too.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.698
Just please
don't damage my computer

07:46.700 --> 07:48.233
And... and... and...

07:48.235 --> 07:51.036
And don't hurt me.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.206
Oh, we're not
gonna hurt you or
your computer, nick.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.440
No. We're
gonna leave that

07:55.442 --> 07:58.310
To our vice president
of collections... eliot.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.312
Oh, boy, another one like you.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.248
I don't think I can take...

08:05.252 --> 08:07.118
Eliot?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.257
That's me.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.161
Nice to meet you.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.497
Yee-aaaaah!

08:18.499 --> 08:19.731
Aaaaaaah!

08:19.733 --> 08:21.299
Both: Aaaaah!

08:21.301 --> 08:23.201
Aaaah!
Yeee-aaaaah!

08:23.203 --> 08:25.136
Aaaaah!

08:25.138 --> 08:26.271
Aah.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.673
30 large in cash
christmas morning

08:28.675 --> 08:31.576
Or you, nick, are the cocoa.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.477
I understand.
I understand. Ok.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.013
Oh, that's hot.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.147
Oh, did billy burn himself?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.282
It's ok.
Let harry blow.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.717
Let harry blow.
Now go untie him!

08:41.554 --> 08:43.054
Ok.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.658
Ok.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.692
Ow.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.295
Uh, guys, wait.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.697
Uh, I'm gonna need lappy

08:52.699 --> 08:55.100
If you want me to make
any headway on your cash.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.234
No, I don't...

08:56.236 --> 08:57.569
Tch, tch, tch, tch, tch!

08:57.571 --> 09:01.239
Ok.
You can have it.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.349
Thank you.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.553
And, nick...

09:14.555 --> 09:17.289
Don't try to leave
town, either. Ok?

09:17.291 --> 09:19.291
Or eliot here will
start by disabling

09:19.293 --> 09:20.825
Your precious hard drive there,

09:20.827 --> 09:22.694
And then he's
gonna work his way
up to you.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.728
Yeah.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.331
I'm not leaving town.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.134
Game's over.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.507
It's time to get out.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.128
Whoa!

09:57.130 --> 10:00.098
 Fire is burning slow 

10:00.100 --> 10:03.368
 now where's
that mistletoe? 

10:03.370 --> 10:06.104
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 

10:06.106 --> 10:07.238
 dear 

10:07.240 --> 10:10.642
 it's getting
kind of hot in here 

10:10.644 --> 10:13.578
 I need a taste
of christmas cheer 

10:13.580 --> 10:14.646
 hope he gets here quick 

10:14.648 --> 10:17.515
 I need
a saint nick, nick 

10:17.517 --> 10:21.119
 I guess
it just had to be 

10:21.121 --> 10:23.488
 all wrapped up for me 

10:23.490 --> 10:24.689
Ack!

10:24.691 --> 10:27.125
Man: Ok, you got it?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.394
Here we go.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.697
 He traded in his reindeer
for a limousine 

10:32.699 --> 10:36.368
 he's wearing purple trousers
instead of red and green 

10:36.370 --> 10:39.137
On 2.
Ready?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.373
Ooh. Aah.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.443
Aaaaaah!

10:45.445 --> 10:46.811
Go on.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.813
Hey!

10:48.815 --> 10:52.283
Children, chanting:
We want santa!

10:52.285 --> 10:54.719
We want santa!

10:54.721 --> 10:56.655
We want santa!

11:05.465 --> 11:06.665
Ooh!

11:26.486 --> 11:27.619
Murray, hurry up.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.621
There's about a thousand brats

11:29.623 --> 11:31.222
Waiting for us out there.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.593
Hey, you, elf.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.295
You see someone go in there?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.968
Oh, great.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.273
What now, nick?

12:00.787 --> 12:02.587
Murray.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.900
Just in the nick of time.

12:16.903 --> 12:17.903
Hey!

12:17.904 --> 12:19.504
What the...

12:19.506 --> 12:20.805
Come here!

12:20.807 --> 12:24.375
Children, chanting:
We want santa claus!

12:24.377 --> 12:27.245
We want santa claus!

12:27.247 --> 12:29.247
Ohh!
You!

12:30.383 --> 12:32.517
Your elf's waiting for you.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.553
Oh! Yes, yes.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.654
Ho ho!

12:36.656 --> 12:39.390
Well, uh, thank you, eliot.

12:39.392 --> 12:43.394
Hey, how do you know my name?

12:43.396 --> 12:46.397
Well, I'm santa, am I not?

12:46.399 --> 12:47.866
Ho ho ho!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.400
Ha ha ha!

12:49.402 --> 12:51.936
Have you been a good boy?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.939
Of course I've been a good boy.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.675
Have you really?

12:57.677 --> 12:59.778
Yes.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.848
Ok.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.415
Store elf: Here he is,
the guy you've been
waiting for...

13:05.418 --> 13:06.618
Santa!

13:06.620 --> 13:07.819
Santa?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.354
Everybody...

13:09.356 --> 13:10.722
Just be good for goodness sakes!

13:10.724 --> 13:11.823
Hello?

13:11.825 --> 13:12.825
Where you goin'?

13:12.826 --> 13:14.425
Gotta find a place to hide out.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.894
But where?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.896
Murray!
Where you goin'?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.865
Don't leave me alone
with these kids.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.806
There's no place like home.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.442
There's no place like home.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.312
Ho ho! All right!

13:35.515 --> 13:36.915
John: Ok.
Everybody ready?

13:36.917 --> 13:38.049
Yup.

13:38.051 --> 13:41.352
"'twas the night
before christmas,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.488
"when all through the house,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.423
"not a creature was stirring,

13:45.425 --> 13:47.425
"not even a mouse.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.461
"the stockings were hung
by the chimney with care

13:50.463 --> 13:52.096
"in the hopes
that saint nicholas

13:52.098 --> 13:53.665
Soon would be there."

13:55.335 --> 13:56.968
Oh, who on earth could that be?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.069
Nobody move.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.938
Maybe it's saint nicholas.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.539
I don't think so, peter.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.408
Saint nick doesn't usually
come to the front door.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.076
Ho ho ho!

14:05.078 --> 14:06.477
Santa?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.546
Are you sure you got
the right house?

14:08.548 --> 14:10.748
Well, 300 walnut.

14:10.750 --> 14:11.883
Oh.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.018
Something's here. Oop.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.120
Nick?

14:16.122 --> 14:17.422
Ha ha ha!

14:17.424 --> 14:19.357
<i>Saint</i> nick today.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.392
Whoo!

14:20.393 --> 14:21.426
Nick. What on earth
are you doing here?

14:21.428 --> 14:22.627
Hello, gorgeous.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.029
How do you manage to
stay so young and pretty

14:25.031 --> 14:26.531
Married to this
stick-in-the-mud, huh?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.866
Peter: Uncle nick!

14:27.868 --> 14:30.735
Oh, it's peter cottontail!

14:30.737 --> 14:33.371
Hey, I don't have a cotton tail.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.505
Oh, no?

14:34.507 --> 14:36.507
Then what is this, huh?

14:36.509 --> 14:37.909
Oh...

14:37.911 --> 14:40.645
Abby? Where's kaitlin?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.046
And who is this runway model

14:42.048 --> 14:43.381
We have here?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.515
Stop!

14:44.517 --> 14:46.050
Well, look at you.
You're all grown up.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.522
Well, there he is...

14:51.524 --> 14:53.124
Dan the man.

14:58.665 --> 14:59.931
Woo woo woo woo woo!

14:59.933 --> 15:01.065
How you doin'?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.400
Great.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.601
Did you get
my e-mail?

15:03.603 --> 15:04.669
Yes, I did.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.005
Oh, look at them together.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.039
Yeah?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.507
And may I say that I love tibet.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.410
The himalayas
are just outstanding,

15:12.412 --> 15:15.146
And I'm so down with oaxaca.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.081
Very cool pyramids.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.716
But I see your first summer

15:18.718 --> 15:20.084
After high school graduation

15:20.086 --> 15:21.920
In the principality of monaco.

15:21.922 --> 15:22.854
Monaco.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.022
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

15:24.024 --> 15:25.823
Monaco? Oh, for...

15:25.825 --> 15:27.091
Soaking up the rays
on the beach by day

15:27.093 --> 15:29.060
And sticking it
to the casinos
by night.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.162
I call it "the killer bs"...

15:31.164 --> 15:32.797
Beaches, babes, and big bucks.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.033
Ooh, I could go with that.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.534
I could go with that.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.936
Ok, here we go.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.671
1, 2, 3, go.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.040
Oh, man! You're
getting faster.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.675
What's that,
been practicing now?

15:43.677 --> 15:44.677
No, no.

15:44.678 --> 15:45.810
Incoming!

15:45.812 --> 15:47.445
Whoo! Whoo!

15:47.447 --> 15:49.013
Whoa!

15:49.015 --> 15:51.716
Oh, come on, little brother,

15:51.718 --> 15:53.718
Don't pretend you're
not happy to see me.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.154
Oh, of course
he's happy to see you.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.222
It's just we weren't
expecting you, nick.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.858
The spanish weren't
expecting the inquisition,

16:00.860 --> 16:03.828
But that didn't stop torquemada.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.497
You know, it's not fair
that you got all the brains

16:06.499 --> 16:09.000
And I got stuck
with just good looks.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.902
What are you doing here, nick?

16:10.904 --> 16:12.770
What, honestly?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.872
If that's possible.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.909
Well, there's no place
like home for the holidays,

16:17.911 --> 16:19.744
Is there?

16:19.745 --> 16:21.578
And there's no place
I'd rather spend
some quality time

16:21.581 --> 16:22.914
Than right here....

16:22.916 --> 16:24.949
With my favorite niece
and nephews.

16:24.951 --> 16:29.554
Why is it I have trouble
believing that story?

16:30.640 --> 16:31.723
Nick: Who's up
for some house hockey?

16:31.725 --> 16:32.824
Me!

16:32.825 --> 16:33.924
Ok, now where did we
set it up last time?

16:33.927 --> 16:35.526
Oh, that's right,
right around here.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.594
Can I be goalie?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.496
Oh! There's been
a major outbreak

16:38.498 --> 16:39.998
Of that new reindeer flu.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.733
The emergency room's overrun.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.201
Oh. No, john.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.203
Not tonight of all nights?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.804
Well, that's what I get

16:46.806 --> 16:48.206
For marrying a doctor.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.807
That's what you get
for being a doctor,

16:49.809 --> 16:51.242
Because they're
calling everybody.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.677
What?

16:52.679 --> 16:53.878
That'll be you.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.546
Oh, no.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.016
Why both of us?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.217
It's christmas eve.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.186
What are we supposed
to do with the kids?

17:02.188 --> 17:03.654
We can't leave them
on their own.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.922
Where's your goalie?

17:08.127 --> 17:10.661
Oh, no.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.731
No.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.767
No.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.167
Abby: It'll be fine.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.237
Nick is not a bad guy.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.172
I think he's trying
to mend fences.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.773
Give him a chance.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.142
It is christmas.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.613
"the stockings were hung
by the chimney with care

17:28.615 --> 17:30.014
"in hopes that saint nicholas

17:30.016 --> 17:32.250
Soon would be there."

17:32.252 --> 17:33.684
Don't hold your breath.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.788
Hey, chill out, katy,
'cause some of us

17:36.790 --> 17:40.258
Like believing
in impossible things.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.660
He believes in you.
Isn't that enough?

17:42.662 --> 17:45.997
I was about 5 when I
figured it all out.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.733
The whole present-
delivery setup thing
seemed kind of fishy,

17:48.735 --> 17:50.635
So I did the math.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.170
For santa to get to
all the world's children

17:52.172 --> 17:54.506
On christmas eve,

17:54.507 --> 17:56.841
He would have to travel
at about 650 miles
per second.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.042
I mean...

17:58.044 --> 18:00.211
That's 300,000 times
the speed of sound.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.312
Wow.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.948
That's pretty fast
for a heavyset dude.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.584
Kaitlin: Oh, but
that would also explain

18:06.586 --> 18:08.086
Why nobody ever sees him.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.887
Because he'd be going so fast,

18:09.889 --> 18:11.989
We'd look like
living statues to him.

18:13.525 --> 18:15.058
But you know
that's physically
impossible, so...

18:15.061 --> 18:18.896
So there is no santa claus?

18:18.898 --> 18:21.899
No. You know, pete,
there is a santa claus.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.601
Just ignore everything she says.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.002
She's just trying to show off.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.604
Can you believe
teachers give out as

18:26.606 --> 18:27.905
For junk like that?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.607
All right, guys, we're off.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.609
Good night, you.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.844
Mm, sorry.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.278
Good night.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.081
Sorry about this, honey.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.150
Good night.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.018
Yeah. Thank you
very much, nick.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.153
No problem.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.155
I'll go get the car.
Thanks.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.690
Ok. Ahem.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.693
"the children were nestled
all snug in their beds..."

18:48.695 --> 18:50.194
John: That's not such
a bad idea, you know?

18:50.196 --> 18:52.363
Maybe you guys ought to
hit the sack early tonight.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.398
Ohh.
What?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.766
Oh, dad!

18:55.768 --> 18:57.735
Hey, the sooner you get to bed,

18:57.737 --> 18:59.270
The sooner santa comes.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.372
We're not done
with the book yet.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.941
Thank you, uncle nick.
Come on, guys.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.343
Hugs, kisses.
Let's go, off to bed.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.878
See ya, buddy.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.146
Come on, you guys.
Give me a big one.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.280
It's not fair.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.781
Oh, it's not fair.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.016
Ohhh.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.284
And you know what?

19:13.286 --> 19:14.752
I'm gonna hang on
to this for you.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.754
But, dad...

19:15.755 --> 19:16.754
You can have it back tomorrow.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.889
Bye, dad.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.357
Good night, sweetheart.
Have a good sleep.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.424
Oh!

19:20.426 --> 19:21.926
Have fun at the hospital.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.227
Oh, thank you very much.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.062
Come on, danny.
You, too.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.398
What?

19:29.335 --> 19:31.202
Dad, it's not even 9:00.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.238
You gotta be kidding me.
Dad, come on.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.974
I wanna stay up
with uncle nick
and then hang out.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.442
We got stuff to talk about.

19:38.444 --> 19:42.313
We can <i> hang</i> with uncle nick
when we're all together.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.048
I would like you
up in your room.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.118
You can catch up on some
of your reading, please.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.455
Look, I'll go to bed
when you want me...

19:51.457 --> 19:54.125
Get to your room right now!

19:54.127 --> 19:56.794
Now, you should
be totally grounded

19:56.796 --> 19:58.963
For all the stuff
you pulled today.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.234
Come on, let's go.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.771
It's...

20:10.043 --> 20:11.409
Merry christmas.

20:23.089 --> 20:26.390
Nick: Rule with
a steady hand, john.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.292
Dad would be proud.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.127
I hate doing that.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.401
Nick: Don't worry.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.036
I've got it all under control.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.271
You go do your thing.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.506
I'm proud of you, little bro.

20:54.454 --> 20:58.422
"insufficient funds
on deposit."

21:00.260 --> 21:01.959
Duh!

21:01.961 --> 21:04.929
If I had the money,
I wouldn't need the loan.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.864
Oh!

21:10.937 --> 21:12.370
All righty.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.440
Could be a potential investor.

21:17.543 --> 21:20.444
Oh, uncle nicko needs a break.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.380
Harry, on computer:
Oh, we're getting there.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.315
We're getting him.
We're getting him.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.284
The shark has found its prey!

21:26.286 --> 21:27.385
Hello, nick!

21:27.387 --> 21:29.820
You rotten little worm.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.857
Did you forget we have
your e-mail address?

21:32.859 --> 21:35.192
And don't think
you can cut us off,
either, wrigley,

21:35.194 --> 21:36.460
'cause we're tracking you

21:36.462 --> 21:37.928
And we're about to
find you right now.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.797
Harry: Heh heh!
We're nearly there.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.400
Do something.
Do something.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.503
Harry: We'll find you
right now.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.805
Dare I?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.173
I dare.

21:49.175 --> 21:52.343
The wrigley super virus...

21:52.345 --> 21:54.945
Invented for just this occasion.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.883
Bye-bye.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.952
That'll scramble
their hard drive.

22:03.456 --> 22:07.825
And every other
working computer
within 50 miles.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.265
Man: Whoa! Albert!

22:14.267 --> 22:16.600
Albert! I can't seem
to control this thing!

22:16.602 --> 22:19.003
It's descending
much too quickly!

22:19.005 --> 22:20.471
Whoa! Albert, help me!

22:20.473 --> 22:22.039
Help me!

22:26.112 --> 22:28.346
Swanson? No.

22:56.642 --> 22:57.975
Hey.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.143
That was you.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.911
No. I thought
it was you.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.316
Or maybe a squirrel?

23:05.318 --> 23:06.917
If he's a squirrel,

23:06.919 --> 23:08.586
He's the size
of a saint bernard.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.390
Hold on.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.229
Ah!

23:24.070 --> 23:25.503
Did you see wh...

23:52.365 --> 23:53.564
Mm.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.167
Mm.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.108
All right, albert, I'm in.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.476
Elf: Good work, santa.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.977
Now you gotta look
for their computer.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.379
You see anything around?

24:08.381 --> 24:10.281
I see it, yes. Yes.

24:10.283 --> 24:11.949
Ok, you wanna go over there

24:11.951 --> 24:13.350
And look for something
that's flashing or whatever,

24:13.352 --> 24:14.618
And you're gonna put it
into the trash can.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.086
Now what?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.955
Just click it
and move it over there.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.023
Ok, yes.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.959
Yes.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.297
That's it?

24:25.298 --> 24:27.398
That little thing grounded us?

24:27.400 --> 24:28.499
Sorry. That's it.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.067
I'm telling you, albert,

24:30.069 --> 24:32.636
This fancy technology
is more trouble
than it's worth.

24:32.638 --> 24:36.440
I know. I know
it's just a backup.

24:36.442 --> 24:37.541
Well, next year,

24:37.543 --> 24:39.376
The reindeer are
lining up for flu shots

24:39.378 --> 24:40.511
Like the rest of us.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.147
Right. Albert!

24:43.149 --> 24:46.183
I've got to get to work now.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.686
I'm hanging up.
Good-bye.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.395
Well, I might as well
begin here.

24:59.999 --> 25:04.268
Let's see now...
The wrigleys.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.170
Ah, yes.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.539
Peter, nice.

25:08.541 --> 25:12.076
Kaitlin, nice.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.644
And dan...

25:13.646 --> 25:16.046
Oh, danny.

25:18.684 --> 25:22.286
On the "naughty" list
again, danny, huh?

25:22.288 --> 25:25.356
And I bet you've been no help

25:25.358 --> 25:27.424
In steering your nephew
in the right direction,

25:27.426 --> 25:30.427
Have you, mr. Nick-on-the-
naughty-list-for-life?

26:10.169 --> 26:12.469
Whoa!

26:12.471 --> 26:13.671
What I saw?

26:13.673 --> 26:14.772
Whoa!
What? What?

26:16.776 --> 26:18.409
H-h-how'd you
get in here?

26:18.411 --> 26:19.777
What... who are you?

26:19.779 --> 26:21.145
Um...

26:21.147 --> 26:22.279
Um, don't worry.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.781
It's not what you think.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.416
No. Um, I, uh...

26:25.418 --> 26:28.218
Uh... uh, you're
just hallucinating.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.854
Yeah. I'm not really here.
You're dreaming. Yes.

26:30.856 --> 26:33.123
Look over there.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.491
Yeah.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.364
Ah!
Ah!

26:40.366 --> 26:42.366
Gaah!

26:53.713 --> 26:54.713
Nick: Danny...

26:54.714 --> 26:55.714
Yeah?

26:55.715 --> 26:57.514
Nick: Stay away
from the egg nog.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.152
Would you stop kicking him?

27:02.154 --> 27:03.854
What if he's still awake?

27:09.195 --> 27:10.195
Stop.

27:15.768 --> 27:18.402
It's him, isn't it?

27:18.404 --> 27:20.671
It's the real <i> him.</i>

27:22.742 --> 27:23.807
No.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.709
No, it's not the real <i> him,</i>

27:25.711 --> 27:27.277
Because there's no such thing

27:27.279 --> 27:29.480
As the real <i> him.</i>

27:29.482 --> 27:32.149
Well, then who is <i> him?</i>

27:32.151 --> 27:34.618
Where did he come from?

27:35.421 --> 27:37.921
I don't know, but, uh...

27:37.923 --> 27:42.860
I'm sure that there is
a logical explanation
for this.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.728
Logical explanation?

27:46.399 --> 27:48.399
Whoaaa!

27:48.401 --> 27:52.403
Aaah! Maybe not!

27:52.405 --> 27:55.172
Whoo! What the...

27:55.174 --> 27:57.207
I gotta lay off the egg nog.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.308
Oh!

28:00.312 --> 28:01.812
Uh...

28:01.814 --> 28:03.714
Danny!

28:09.755 --> 28:11.588
Gah!

28:12.558 --> 28:14.858
Did you happen to push a button

28:14.860 --> 28:17.261
On that... Ball?

28:17.263 --> 28:18.829
Th-this?

28:18.831 --> 28:20.864
Yes!

28:21.834 --> 28:24.868
I... I think so.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.571
Well, press...

28:27.573 --> 28:28.573
Another...

28:28.574 --> 28:30.207
Button!

28:40.319 --> 28:41.485
Oh!

28:42.855 --> 28:44.221
Ok.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.224
Wow!

28:47.226 --> 28:49.293
May I see that?

28:51.597 --> 28:53.397
Oh...

28:53.399 --> 28:55.499
This is the real santa claus.

28:57.470 --> 29:01.905
A real... Dead santa claus.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.408
Oh, he's not dead.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.542
He's just unconscious.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.244
He'll be ok.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.680
Well, what about christmas?

29:10.850 --> 29:12.516
What about christmas?

29:12.518 --> 29:13.684
Christmas?

29:13.686 --> 29:15.986
It-it's christmas eve.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.689
Yeah?

29:18.691 --> 29:22.860
Well, if this is all real
and he's the real santa,

29:22.862 --> 29:25.729
Then he's gotta deliver
all these presents tonight.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.397
But if he's knocked out
too long,

29:27.399 --> 29:29.566
He's not gonna be able
to deliver any presents.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.536
I mean, there
won't be a christmas.

29:32.538 --> 29:33.937
What are we gonna do?

29:33.939 --> 29:35.839
Calm down, ok?

29:35.841 --> 29:36.907
First of all,

29:36.909 --> 29:40.310
<i>We</i> are gonna do nothing.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.045
<i>Nada.</i> Zippo.

29:42.047 --> 29:43.981
Ok, this whole christmas thing,

29:43.983 --> 29:45.415
That's not our problem.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.583
That's his gig.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.318
I mean, if you wanna tote around

29:48.320 --> 29:49.720
A heavy bag full of presents

29:49.722 --> 29:52.055
For people you don't even know,

29:52.057 --> 29:54.858
Well, that's fine
with me, but, uh-uh.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.661
Yeah, but it's...

29:57.663 --> 29:59.563
It's what?

30:00.466 --> 30:01.899
Hmm?

30:03.869 --> 30:05.469
What?

30:08.474 --> 30:10.440
Danny?

30:14.847 --> 30:16.346
Ah!

30:16.348 --> 30:17.848
Oh, no.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.850
Ok, uh...

30:51.383 --> 30:52.616
Hmm.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.018
Ohh! Oh!

31:02.928 --> 31:04.127
Whoa.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.597
Hoo.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.367
Oh!

31:12.905 --> 31:15.739
Ho! Oh!

31:15.741 --> 31:17.374
Wow!

31:18.777 --> 31:20.577
Oh.

31:23.816 --> 31:25.582
Yeah.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.917
Santa.

31:26.919 --> 31:30.020
Goin' high tech, huh, santa?

31:30.022 --> 31:31.054
Oop.

31:39.865 --> 31:44.534
Whoa! Oh! Ohh!

31:50.976 --> 31:52.509
Uh!

31:55.414 --> 31:56.546
Off.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.683
Wow!

31:59.685 --> 32:00.984
Yeeh!

32:03.956 --> 32:05.155
Oh.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.124
Um...

32:07.126 --> 32:08.926
Uh, uh...

32:10.629 --> 32:13.664
Wah-hoo!

32:22.875 --> 32:24.708
Hoo!

32:27.746 --> 32:28.845
Oh!

32:28.847 --> 32:32.115
This has possibilities.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.450
Oh.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.952
Oh, uh...

32:36.121 --> 32:37.454
Christmas.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.722
We really should do something.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.958
You know, you make
a very good point.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.761
What if we pick up the gauntlet

32:44.763 --> 32:49.599
And selflessly fulfill
santa's miraculous
mission ourselves?

32:51.003 --> 32:52.035
Really?

32:52.037 --> 32:53.971
Really.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.872
But you were just saying

32:55.874 --> 32:58.175
That you didn't wanna
have anything to do with it.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.043
That was then.
This is now.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.712
You made me see the light.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.113
And you don't want
all the kids
in the world

33:03.115 --> 33:04.681
To go presentless, do you?

33:04.683 --> 33:07.884
No, no. But I guess
I'm just a little confused.

33:07.886 --> 33:10.721
Santa's got a flight
controller on his sleigh

33:10.723 --> 33:12.022
That's not too much
different from the one

33:12.024 --> 33:13.757
I got you
for your last birthday.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.491
How do you know
he has a flight controller

33:15.494 --> 33:16.827
On his sleigh like that?

33:16.829 --> 33:19.029
I saw it.
It's up on...

33:19.031 --> 33:20.764
You will not believe...

33:20.766 --> 33:22.165
Trust me.
You'll see it.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.633
Listen, you're the whiz

33:23.635 --> 33:24.901
At all these computer games,

33:24.903 --> 33:26.169
Not me, so you'll be the pilot.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.537
I'll just deliver the presents.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.039
We'll be a team.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.907
We'll be heroes.

33:30.909 --> 33:32.609
We'll save the day!

33:32.611 --> 33:34.745
This is it, man.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.183
This is our first adventure.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.952
This is what we've
always talked about.

33:41.954 --> 33:43.887
Are you with me, partner?

33:43.889 --> 33:45.689
Yeah.
Yeah!

33:45.691 --> 33:47.924
Wait. What about
kaitlin and peter?

33:47.926 --> 33:49.693
We can't just leave them alone.

33:50.929 --> 33:52.529
Well, they're not alone.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.797
He's here.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.532
I mean, unconscious or not,

33:55.534 --> 33:57.034
He's still a bona fide
adult, right?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.535
And besides,
by the time they
wake up in the morning,

33:58.537 --> 33:59.936
We'll have already been back,

33:59.938 --> 34:01.938
Woken up the big guy
from his little nap,

34:01.940 --> 34:04.307
And collected
whatever reward
we are sure to get

34:04.309 --> 34:05.942
For saving christmas.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.544
Ha ha! Huh?

34:07.546 --> 34:08.812
Yeah!

34:08.813 --> 34:10.112
Yeah!

34:10.114 --> 34:13.583
Whoa!
Ha ha ha!

34:16.054 --> 34:18.755
Nick: Whoo-hoo!
Look at me!

34:18.757 --> 34:21.091
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

34:21.092 --> 34:25.027
Whoa! This is like
a really cool
video game.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.030
Yeah.

34:26.031 --> 34:27.664
Except you got
bugs in your teeth.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.233
Whoo! We're smokin'!

34:30.235 --> 34:32.969
Hoo hoo hoo!
Oh, baby!

34:34.206 --> 34:35.806
Where are we going?

34:35.808 --> 34:38.041
Well, I thought we'd start
on the east side of town...

34:38.043 --> 34:39.342
The gold coast.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.143
You know, those rich kids
get so many presents,

34:41.146 --> 34:42.779
I figured, if we
dump this stuff first,

34:42.781 --> 34:44.181
We'd lighten our load.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.348
Good thinking.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.750
Ah, well, you know.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.918
Ok, hang a right.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.591
Nick: Whoo-hoo!

34:54.592 --> 34:56.193
Whoo!

35:07.372 --> 35:08.839
Huh?

35:12.311 --> 35:14.711
Uncle nick.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.717
Uncle nick.

35:24.656 --> 35:29.359
Aah!

35:29.361 --> 35:31.194
Danny: It looks like
all you have to do

35:31.196 --> 35:33.797
Is reach your hand
in the bag, pull it out,

35:33.799 --> 35:35.332
And you'll have
the right present.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.634
Nick: Cool!

35:42.341 --> 35:44.341
Listen, you're
delivering a present

35:44.343 --> 35:46.243
To a girl named kathy.

35:46.245 --> 35:50.247
She wanted a real pony
for christmas.

35:50.249 --> 35:54.050
She was naughty
13 times this year,

35:54.052 --> 35:56.653
So she gets...

35:56.655 --> 35:58.688
An ant farm.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.891
Aw, that's cold, man.

36:00.893 --> 36:02.826
Yeah.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.095
Danny: So once
you have the present,

36:05.097 --> 36:06.396
Just put it under the tree,

36:06.398 --> 36:08.965
Take the bally-wally
and zap it.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.700
Gotcha.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.875
Ah.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.810
Gotcha.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.712
No, no, don't get up.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.214
I won't be a minute.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.193
Ooh.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.929
I like.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.132
Ooh.

36:43.235 --> 36:44.935
Gotcha.

36:51.376 --> 36:52.943
Olé!

37:01.420 --> 37:03.019
Now...

37:14.366 --> 37:17.000
Ho ho ho!

37:17.002 --> 37:18.768
Spreading the wealth.

37:26.278 --> 37:29.279
Oh, lovely little things.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.081
Spreading the wealth.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.217
Ooh. Nice tune.

37:43.228 --> 37:44.794
Let's boogie.

37:44.796 --> 37:45.862
Heh heh!

37:45.864 --> 37:47.097
What...

37:47.099 --> 37:48.231
What's wrong?

37:48.233 --> 37:49.366
Nothing.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.834
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.236
That's you!

37:53.238 --> 37:55.238
Look at that.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.874
I looked up myself
on the database.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.176
Cool.

37:59.177 --> 38:00.477
Yeah. "daniel wrigley.
Shakes down his brother.

38:00.479 --> 38:04.347
Spends most of his time
scamming."

38:04.349 --> 38:05.782
Egh!

38:05.784 --> 38:07.817
Santa thinks I'm bad.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.320
I can't believe it.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.290
Though that would explain

38:13.292 --> 38:15.325
The <i> greatest disco hits</i>
<i>of the seventies</i> cd

38:15.327 --> 38:16.926
I got last year.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.028
Wait a minute.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.429
I like that cd.

38:19.431 --> 38:23.199
You know what the problem
with people like santa is?

38:23.201 --> 38:25.268
Trust me, I know a million
of these kinda guys...

38:25.270 --> 38:27.804
All high and mighty,
the big boss.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.074
But who is kris kringle
anyhow, huh?

38:31.076 --> 38:32.809
I mean, how did he get this job?

38:32.811 --> 38:34.210
I don't remember voting for him.

38:34.212 --> 38:35.345
Do you?

38:35.347 --> 38:38.081
Who is he to judge?

38:38.083 --> 38:43.186
Now, I say
that it's our turn
to call the shots.

38:43.188 --> 38:44.954
<i>We'll</i> decide
who gets what
for christmas.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.222
Are you with me?

38:46.224 --> 38:47.357
Hmm?
Yeah.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.958
You bet your life, yeah.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.240
Kaitlin:
Who do you think he is?

39:04.242 --> 39:06.076
Peter: I don't know.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.578
Ah!
Ah!

39:08.580 --> 39:10.413
All right, big guy!

39:10.415 --> 39:12.148
Who are you

39:12.149 --> 39:13.882
And what have you done
with my brother
and uncle nick?

39:13.885 --> 39:15.118
Mm!

39:20.525 --> 39:22.859
Aagh!

39:23.962 --> 39:25.295
His beard's real, anyway.

39:25.297 --> 39:27.197
Of course it's real.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.132
I'm santa claus.

39:29.134 --> 39:32.135
I think he is.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.672
Oh, please!

39:35.673 --> 39:37.373
First of all, there's
no such thing as santa.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.875
And second of all,
even if there was,

39:38.877 --> 39:40.377
He wouldn't be caught dead

39:40.379 --> 39:41.611
In any house
with danny wrigley in it.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.880
Is that so, kaitlin?

39:43.882 --> 39:45.882
Well, you're not
so angelic yourself.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.118
Or perhaps you
didn't think I saw you

39:48.120 --> 39:51.020
Copy that answer off
ricky garibaldi's
spelling test

39:51.022 --> 39:52.422
In the third grade.

39:52.424 --> 39:55.024
Ahh.

39:57.262 --> 39:59.996
And you can forget
about that brontosaurus

39:59.998 --> 40:01.464
I asked for in second grade.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.066
My parents were right.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.901
The backyard is too small.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.269
Thank you, peter.

40:06.271 --> 40:07.404
Ohh!

40:07.406 --> 40:08.671
Ohh. Ohh.

40:08.673 --> 40:11.007
I haven't felt this bad

40:11.009 --> 40:12.475
Since the tainted
egg nog outbreak

40:12.477 --> 40:14.310
Back in '06.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.147
Yup, it's gone.

40:17.149 --> 40:20.049
Nothing on the roof
but the chimney.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.419
Santa: Oh, dear.

40:22.421 --> 40:25.221
Where in heaven's name
could my sleigh have gone?

40:25.223 --> 40:28.191
It's not all that hard
to figure out, santa.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.593
I mean, valuable sleigh,
missing big brother...

40:30.595 --> 40:32.195
Danny probably copped it.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.363
What?

40:33.365 --> 40:34.697
Lifted it.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.266
Stole it.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.501
Peter: He wouldn't
steal santa's sleigh.

40:38.503 --> 40:41.171
Then where'd it go, peter?
It didn't just disappear.

40:41.173 --> 40:42.372
Yes, it did.

40:42.374 --> 40:43.640
You don't know anything.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.074
Now, children,

40:45.076 --> 40:47.177
I'm sure there's
a logical explanation.

40:47.179 --> 40:49.646
Perhaps danny, thinking
I was incapacitated,

40:49.648 --> 40:52.348
Is simply trying
to deliver all the toys...

40:52.350 --> 40:53.983
Save christmas.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.953
Danny as santa's helper?

40:56.955 --> 40:58.354
That'll be the day.

40:58.356 --> 41:01.090
Between him and uncle nick,
the only thing they've ever...

41:01.092 --> 41:03.226
Nick?!

41:03.228 --> 41:05.395
Nick wrigley has my sleigh?

41:05.397 --> 41:06.629
Oh, my.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.631
Oh, my, my,
my, my. My!

41:08.633 --> 41:10.266
That'll never do.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.118
I mean, danny,

41:12.119 --> 41:13.969
Why, he's a little naughty
from time to time,

41:13.972 --> 41:16.973
But nick wrigley
is incorrigible!

41:16.975 --> 41:19.108
Oh, my. Oh, dear.

41:19.110 --> 41:22.479
I have to get my sleigh back.

41:22.481 --> 41:23.646
Hello! Albert!

41:23.648 --> 41:24.648
Hello!
Can you hear me?

41:24.649 --> 41:26.716
Oh, of course he can't hear me.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.619
This gizmo is hooked up
to the sleigh's computer,

41:29.621 --> 41:31.120
And the computer
is in the sleigh,

41:31.122 --> 41:33.456
And the sleigh is gone,
and... oh!

41:33.458 --> 41:36.326
Oh!

41:36.328 --> 41:39.028
Oh, wait.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.563
The computer.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.265
That's uncle nick's.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.734
Kaitlin: What
about the computer?

41:44.736 --> 41:46.035
Well, this year,

41:46.037 --> 41:48.004
My sleigh is being
run by a computer.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.139
The reindeer are all
sick with the flu.

41:50.141 --> 41:53.309
And this computer
interfered
with my sleigh

41:53.311 --> 41:54.711
And brought it down.

41:54.713 --> 41:57.080
Perhaps we can
repeat the process.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.482
Um... Do you know how
to work this thing?

41:59.484 --> 42:00.550
Oh, yes, I do.

42:00.552 --> 42:02.552
Um, so what am I looking for?

42:02.554 --> 42:05.088
Well, it was
a skull-and-crossbones,

42:05.090 --> 42:08.157
And I pushed it
into that container there.

42:08.159 --> 42:09.559
You trashed it, santa.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.461
Sorry. It's gone.

42:11.463 --> 42:12.562
Oh, dear.

42:12.564 --> 42:14.163
Ok, let me think.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.432
There's a computer
on the sleigh, right?

42:16.434 --> 42:18.518
Right.

42:18.519 --> 42:20.603
And so it probably
has a web address,
right?

42:20.605 --> 42:22.438
A web address?

42:22.440 --> 42:24.807
You know, like, worldwide web.

42:24.809 --> 42:27.310
Like... like
santa. Com or...

42:27.312 --> 42:28.578
Oh, yes! Yes, exactly.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.347
Santa.Com. Yes.

42:30.348 --> 42:32.115
Except that name
was already registered.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.317
I'm sclaus2.Com.

42:34.318 --> 42:36.518
Many children send me
their christmas lists
in this new format.

42:36.521 --> 42:38.054
I find it very convenient.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.090
Here's the plan.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.125
Ok. I hack
into the computer
on the sleigh,

42:42.127 --> 42:43.826
I override the
flight-control program,

42:43.828 --> 42:45.361
And I bring that puppy back

42:45.363 --> 42:46.629
Like a well-trained
homing pigeon.

42:46.631 --> 42:49.666
Ok, let's go.

42:49.668 --> 42:51.634
Go? Where?

42:51.636 --> 42:53.403
To the computer store.

42:53.405 --> 42:54.737
All the computers in our house

42:54.739 --> 42:56.506
Are too weak for this job,

42:56.508 --> 42:59.542
But they have
the new loumax 2327...

42:59.544 --> 43:02.078
The most powerful
desktop in the world.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.846
Wonderful.
Let's go.

43:03.848 --> 43:07.216
Um, you know,
you can drive, right?

43:07.218 --> 43:08.551
Of course I can.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.753
Where do
your parents
park their sleigh?

43:10.755 --> 43:14.657
Ok. What are we
supposed to do now?

43:14.659 --> 43:17.393
Kaitlin: Ok,
right up to the light.

43:17.395 --> 43:19.362
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

43:19.364 --> 43:20.463
Right up to...

43:20.465 --> 43:21.764
You don't have to stop yet.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.267
Keep going,
right up to the light.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.169
Right up to the light.

43:26.171 --> 43:27.370
You don't have to stop again.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.505
Come on. Santa...

43:29.507 --> 43:30.707
You're going left!
You're going left!

43:30.709 --> 43:33.343
No, no! Turn right.
Turn right.

43:33.345 --> 43:34.744
Get your foot off the brake!

43:35.747 --> 43:37.347
You're going too fast!

43:37.349 --> 43:39.682
Danny: Uhh.
Darrin, darrin, darrin.

43:39.684 --> 43:41.784
What can I tell you, buddy?

43:41.786 --> 43:44.554
You gotta watch that temper,

43:44.556 --> 43:50.326
But this present
isn't gonna make you
any less angry, so...

43:57.802 --> 43:59.802
 I wish me
a merry christmas 

43:59.804 --> 44:02.238
 I wish me
a merry christmas 

44:02.240 --> 44:04.641
 I wish me
a merry christmas 

44:04.643 --> 44:08.144
 and a chippendale sofa 

44:11.750 --> 44:13.416
Uncle nick.
Oh!

44:13.418 --> 44:15.551
Huh. Yow! D!

44:15.553 --> 44:17.220
Uh, how'd you get in here?

44:17.222 --> 44:18.621
Well, I climbed
through the window
upstairs.

44:18.623 --> 44:19.623
Oh.

44:19.624 --> 44:21.758
Uh, hold on.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.260
Uh, where's darrin's gift?

44:24.262 --> 44:25.945
I got a... I got
a better idea.

44:25.946 --> 44:27.629
Uh, well, I haven't
delivered it yet.

44:27.632 --> 44:31.367
What have you been
doing down here
so long, then?

44:31.369 --> 44:32.402
Oh, you mean, down here?

44:32.404 --> 44:33.936
Yeah.

44:33.938 --> 44:35.405
Yeah, bathroom break.

44:35.407 --> 44:36.773
You know, all the
taking off and landing,

44:36.775 --> 44:38.675
You know, just...

44:38.677 --> 44:41.511
yeah, well, uh, here.

44:41.513 --> 44:42.712
You have the little bally?

44:42.714 --> 44:43.746
Zap it.

44:43.748 --> 44:45.948
All right. Step aside.

44:55.560 --> 44:56.959
A punching bag?

44:56.961 --> 44:59.429
Uh, yeah, yeah.

44:59.431 --> 45:01.764
Well, see, this kid, darrin,

45:01.766 --> 45:04.333
His school record
says that he's, um,

45:04.335 --> 45:05.468
He's been getting into fights,

45:05.470 --> 45:07.770
And I figure he can
pound on this thing

45:07.772 --> 45:08.971
Instead of other kids,

45:08.973 --> 45:11.274
You know, like,
channel his anger

45:11.276 --> 45:13.710
Into a healthy exercise.

45:13.712 --> 45:15.745
That is way cool, dan, my man.

45:15.747 --> 45:17.981
Yeah?
Yeah.

45:17.982 --> 45:20.216
The way
you just look past
all the surface junk

45:20.218 --> 45:22.318
And saw this guy's
potential. Yeah.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.221
Some kids need a break.

45:25.223 --> 45:28.324
Kids need a little
extra attention,

45:28.326 --> 45:29.926
A little extra thought.

45:29.928 --> 45:32.995
Take me.

45:32.997 --> 45:36.566
You know, when I was,
I don't know, about your age,

45:36.568 --> 45:38.401
All I ever asked for
was one thing.

45:38.403 --> 45:39.769
You know what that was?

45:39.771 --> 45:41.537
Hmm?

45:41.539 --> 45:45.875
A custom-made,
jimi hendrix-signed
electric 6-string guitar

45:45.877 --> 45:50.246
With an ebony fingerboard
from mccusack's musak store.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.380
Ha ha ha.

45:51.382 --> 45:52.815
Wowwww!

45:52.817 --> 45:57.520
The most beautiful
rock and roll guitar
in the world.

45:57.522 --> 45:59.388
Every year I'd ask for it,

45:59.390 --> 46:02.892
And every year,
it wasn't under the tree.

46:02.894 --> 46:05.294
I mean, it wasn't like
the folks couldn't afford it.

46:05.296 --> 46:07.530
Your dad got everything
<i>he</i> ever wanted.

46:07.532 --> 46:11.033
Chemistry set, telescope,
microscope, macroscope.

46:13.505 --> 46:15.972
Anyway, he was nice,

46:15.974 --> 46:18.674
And I was naughty.

46:18.676 --> 46:21.410
I mean, not nasty naughty,

46:21.412 --> 46:25.314
You know, just kind of
naturally normal naughty.

46:26.718 --> 46:28.551
Ah.

46:28.553 --> 46:30.553
And you know,
if you were around back then,

46:30.555 --> 46:32.789
Making the christmas present
decisions,

46:32.791 --> 46:35.625
I'd probably be touring
with the stones right now.

46:35.627 --> 46:37.026
Yeah?

46:37.028 --> 46:38.961
Oh, yeah.

46:38.963 --> 46:41.297
I was good, man,

46:41.299 --> 46:45.568
But with the right equipment,
I could've been great.

46:48.339 --> 46:51.507
Anyway,

46:51.509 --> 46:52.842
Ready?

46:52.844 --> 46:54.343
Yeah.

46:57.048 --> 46:59.415
What?

46:59.417 --> 47:00.550
Nothing.

47:00.552 --> 47:01.584
I mean, you're just...

47:01.586 --> 47:04.020
You're looking kind of lumpy.

47:04.022 --> 47:06.222
Well, yeah.

47:06.223 --> 47:08.423
Cookies and milk,
cookies and milk,
everywhere we go.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.926
No wonder santa
has a weight problem.

47:09.928 --> 47:11.694
Come on.

47:15.867 --> 47:17.834
 Yeah, 1, 2,
get down 

47:17.836 --> 47:19.802
 christmas time
gonna blow your mind 

47:19.804 --> 47:22.071
 'cause it's all good 

47:22.073 --> 47:24.340
 santa claus
will look you up 

47:24.342 --> 47:25.608
 if you've been good 

47:25.610 --> 47:26.843
 aw, yeah 

47:26.845 --> 47:28.477
 christmas time
gonna blow your mind... 

47:28.479 --> 47:29.946
Kaitlin: Uh...

47:29.948 --> 47:34.650
Santa, I don't think
that taking a shortcut
was such a good idea.

47:34.652 --> 47:36.485
Why not?

47:36.487 --> 47:37.854
Just a hunch.

47:37.856 --> 47:39.822
Nonsense.

47:39.824 --> 47:41.757
Excuse me, boys.

47:43.661 --> 47:46.696
Santa: Would you mind
moving your vehicle?

47:48.499 --> 47:49.899
I don't think they heard me.

47:49.901 --> 47:53.803
I think they heard you, santa.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.505
Oh, my god.

48:04.883 --> 48:05.915
Kaitlin, what are you doing?

48:05.917 --> 48:08.918
I think this boy wants to talk.

48:10.788 --> 48:12.955
Uh-oh.

48:12.957 --> 48:14.924
Well, well, well.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.959
What do we have here?

48:16.961 --> 48:19.395
Santa claus and
his little elves.

48:19.397 --> 48:20.763
Ha ha ha! Dear, no.

48:20.765 --> 48:22.915
These aren't elves.

48:22.916 --> 48:25.066
Elves are actually
shorter creatures
with pointy ears,

48:25.069 --> 48:26.669
Mischievous and disobedient,

48:26.671 --> 48:28.004
But inherently kind.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.173
You tryin'
to play games
with me, buddy?

48:31.175 --> 48:32.909
Would you like to play a game?

48:32.911 --> 48:34.176
All right.

48:36.814 --> 48:37.814
What?

48:37.815 --> 48:38.948
Santa: Is this
some new game

48:38.950 --> 48:40.716
I'm not aware of?

48:40.718 --> 48:42.919
Kaitlin: Yeah,
it's called the "we're
in big trouble" game.

48:42.921 --> 48:44.487
Oh, dear.
These are naughty boys.

48:44.489 --> 48:46.756
Yes, they are.

48:46.758 --> 48:47.957
Stop, boys!

48:47.959 --> 48:49.825
Boys, boys.

48:49.827 --> 48:51.978
Get back here!

48:51.979 --> 48:54.130
Santa! No! Get back!
No! Don't close the door!

48:54.132 --> 48:55.431
Now, boys.

48:55.433 --> 48:56.966
Boys, boys, boys.

48:56.968 --> 48:58.567
Tagger:
Oh, big man!

48:58.569 --> 48:59.869
Hey, big man,
let's see
what you got!

48:59.871 --> 49:01.137
Second tagger:
Look at that dude.

49:01.139 --> 49:04.440
Now, son, I don't want
any trouble.

49:04.442 --> 49:06.575
Sorry, pal,
'cause trouble's
what you got.

49:06.577 --> 49:08.044
Now come on.

49:08.046 --> 49:10.880
I didn't want to
have to do this, but...

49:11.749 --> 49:14.717
Ohh, we are in trouble.

49:14.719 --> 49:16.485
Tagger: Ha ha ha,
you're kidding me,
right?

49:16.487 --> 49:18.020
Ha ha ha ha!

49:18.022 --> 49:19.305
Is this guy for real?

49:19.306 --> 49:20.589
All right,
come on. Let's see
what you got, huh?

49:20.591 --> 49:21.591
Come on, come on, come on!

49:21.592 --> 49:22.792
Like that, huh?

49:24.595 --> 49:25.728
Come on, you gonna
take a punch or what?

49:25.730 --> 49:27.029
Come on, come on!

49:27.031 --> 49:28.497
This guy for real?

49:28.499 --> 49:30.066
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha.

49:30.068 --> 49:31.734
Now cut that out.

49:34.005 --> 49:35.005
Now bring it!

49:35.006 --> 49:36.172
Let's go!

49:37.575 --> 49:38.741
This is it.

49:40.645 --> 49:43.479
Kitchy-kitchy coo!
Ha ha ha ha!

49:44.749 --> 49:47.550
All right,
that ain't funny,
you know!

49:47.552 --> 49:48.751
All right, come on!

49:49.921 --> 49:52.021
Tagger: Come on,
you can take him,
get him!

49:54.892 --> 49:57.793
Kootchy-ootchy-ootchy!

50:01.265 --> 50:03.699
Santa: You give? You give?

50:03.701 --> 50:05.901
I give, I give, I give, I give!

50:09.007 --> 50:10.773
You're one tough tickler, man!

50:10.775 --> 50:12.274
Ho ho ho ho ho.

50:12.276 --> 50:14.276
I swear, you guys
tell anybody about this,

50:14.278 --> 50:15.878
And you're gonna deal with me!

50:15.880 --> 50:17.780
And I don't tickle!

50:17.782 --> 50:19.248
You're all right, dog.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.752
Yeah, how'd ya
like to join my crew?

50:22.754 --> 50:25.187
Ho. That's
very hospitable of you,

50:25.189 --> 50:26.922
But, uh, we've got to get going.

50:26.924 --> 50:28.591
As I said,
we have business
to conduct.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.059
You shouldn't
be driving
around here, man.

50:30.061 --> 50:32.128
There's all kinds
of creeps running
around, you know?

50:32.130 --> 50:33.696
Do you have a better idea?

50:51.282 --> 50:52.948
Ho ho ho ho ho.

50:52.950 --> 50:55.051
Thank you, pablo.

50:55.053 --> 50:57.620
Now you boys
check your stockings
tomorrow

50:57.622 --> 50:59.021
And see what santa brought you.

50:59.023 --> 51:02.324
Tagger: Right on, santa.

51:06.864 --> 51:08.664
Ho ho ho ho ho.

51:08.666 --> 51:12.134
Kind of catching.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

51:19.110 --> 51:22.845
Wow. Albert
would love it.

51:26.918 --> 51:28.717
Peter: Come on, santa.

51:30.588 --> 51:31.720
You're late!

51:31.722 --> 51:34.156
Uh, am I? Uh...

51:34.158 --> 51:35.758
Lot of good you do me now.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.359
I needed you
for the final rush
this afternoon,

51:37.361 --> 51:39.028
Not at closing time.

51:39.029 --> 51:40.696
Don't think I'm not
gonna report this
to your union rep.

51:40.698 --> 51:42.176
Well, actually,

51:42.177 --> 51:43.655
I'm more
of an independent
contractor.

51:43.656 --> 51:45.134
The next time
I need a big man
with computer experience,

51:45.136 --> 51:46.869
I'll put a pillow
under my shirt!

51:46.871 --> 51:50.039
Kaitlin: Um, excuse me, sir,
but could you show me

51:50.041 --> 51:52.274
Where the loumax 2327s
are, please?

51:52.276 --> 51:54.877
Well, go on and show her.

51:54.879 --> 51:56.745
Aisle 2.

51:56.747 --> 51:59.849
Oh, heh.
Right this way.

51:59.851 --> 52:01.050
Ugh.

52:01.052 --> 52:03.052
Temps.

52:19.770 --> 52:21.270
Danny: I got
a good idea.

52:21.272 --> 52:22.972
Why don't we go
to the homeless
shelter?

52:22.974 --> 52:24.840
Pass out some stuff there.

52:24.842 --> 52:26.075
Homeless shelter?

52:26.077 --> 52:28.110
They haven't got anything...

52:28.112 --> 52:31.147
So, yes, we should go there.

52:31.149 --> 52:32.948
Right. I'm with you...

52:32.950 --> 52:35.985
Or... Or...
Hey, here's a great idea.

52:35.987 --> 52:38.187
Why don't we
just zoom over
to the vanderlip mansion

52:38.189 --> 52:42.024
And spread some
christmas magic there?

52:42.026 --> 52:44.226
Nah, there won't
be any kids there.

52:44.228 --> 52:46.862
Just a whole bunch of grownups

52:46.864 --> 52:48.697
In fancy clothes and jewels,

52:48.699 --> 52:49.999
Having a party or something.

52:50.001 --> 52:51.001
Yeah.

52:51.002 --> 52:52.085
They've got more than they need.

52:52.086 --> 52:53.169
Why would we want
to give them more?

52:53.171 --> 52:55.070
Well, we wouldn't.

52:55.072 --> 52:57.940
But, you see, that's...
That's my idea, danny.

52:57.942 --> 53:00.409
Listen, they're probably
gonna have some kind
of major feast, right?

53:00.411 --> 53:03.045
With caviar, roast beef,
all the trimmings.

53:03.047 --> 53:04.313
I guess, yeah.

53:04.315 --> 53:08.050
So, this is where we outdo
that old fogey claus.

53:08.052 --> 53:10.920
We switch the dinners.
Ah ha ha ha!

53:10.922 --> 53:12.454
Yeah, we let the rich folks see

53:12.456 --> 53:14.223
What life is
really like for a change

53:14.225 --> 53:16.825
While, at the same time,
bring a little christmas cheer

53:16.827 --> 53:17.993
To the downtrodden.

53:17.995 --> 53:20.129
That's a great idea!

53:20.131 --> 53:23.065
Man, you <i> are</i> a great santa.

53:23.067 --> 53:24.900
I try.

53:30.474 --> 53:34.143
These babies
are state of the art.

53:34.145 --> 53:37.213
Loumax 2327s...

53:37.215 --> 53:41.250
It's the most
powerful home computer
ever conceived,

53:41.252 --> 53:45.054
With a 1.2 tetrabyte
hard drive

53:45.056 --> 53:47.089
And a 6 gigahertz processor

53:47.091 --> 53:49.825
And 512 megs of ram.

53:55.166 --> 53:57.399
Kaitlin, someone's coming.

53:57.401 --> 53:58.801
Do something!

53:58.803 --> 54:00.502
If they catch us,
they'll throw us out.

54:00.504 --> 54:02.137
Hmm.

54:14.452 --> 54:16.185
Peter:
Excuse me, sir.

54:16.187 --> 54:18.020
Hey,
what are you all
doing over there?

54:18.022 --> 54:21.056
Nothing. I have to go
to the bathroom.

54:21.058 --> 54:22.791
So go.

54:22.793 --> 54:24.927
Can you take me?

54:24.929 --> 54:28.030
Hey, I'm
not your dad,
little kid.

54:28.032 --> 54:31.200
I guess I'll just have
to do it over here, then.

54:31.202 --> 54:34.470
No, no. Not there.
What are you, nuts?

54:34.472 --> 54:37.306
Come on,
I'll show you
where it is.

54:38.175 --> 54:40.442
He's created a diversion.

54:40.444 --> 54:42.878
Great.

54:42.880 --> 54:45.281
Ok. That ought to do it.

54:45.283 --> 54:49.451
Now, push the on button
and hope.

54:49.453 --> 54:52.821
Computer: This is...

54:52.823 --> 54:57.126
Ok. Let's wrangle us
a sleigh.

55:05.569 --> 55:10.105
Yeah, life is finally
cutting us bad boys
a break, huh, danny?

55:10.107 --> 55:11.940
We just might
come out on top this time...

55:11.942 --> 55:14.209
Whoa! Easy, easy.
Hot soup.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.145
Ow.

55:20.617 --> 55:22.817
Yeah, let's definitely
do this again next year.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.186
Yeah.
I'm sure by then,

55:24.188 --> 55:26.121
Santa'll be back
at the controls.

55:26.123 --> 55:29.191
You never can tell
with head injuries.

55:29.193 --> 55:31.560
Yep, you and I
might just have
to take over this gig

55:31.562 --> 55:33.028
For many years to come,
my friend.

55:34.865 --> 55:37.966
There's the mansion.

55:37.968 --> 55:39.468
Oh, yeah.

55:42.940 --> 55:43.940
Danny: Ready?

55:43.941 --> 55:44.973
Yeah.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.842
Let's take her in.

55:48.346 --> 55:50.979
Danny, easy.
This isn't splash mountain.

55:50.981 --> 55:53.382
But I'm not
doing that.
What?

55:53.384 --> 55:54.416
I've lost control.

55:54.418 --> 55:56.285
Somebody else is
steering the sleigh.

55:56.287 --> 55:58.087
Well, who?!

55:58.089 --> 56:01.590
Kaitlin: Oh!
That's gotta be them.

56:01.592 --> 56:03.192
Ok, danny.

56:03.194 --> 56:06.528
Let's show you who's
in the driver's seat.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.864
Danny and nick:
Whoa-oh-oh!

56:08.866 --> 56:10.466
Aaah!

56:10.468 --> 56:11.867
Let me have that thing!

56:11.869 --> 56:13.469
Danny: No, no,
it's not gonna work.

56:13.471 --> 56:18.440
Both: Whoa!

56:18.442 --> 56:20.342
Somebody's hacked
into our system.

56:20.344 --> 56:21.610
They're flying our sleigh.

56:23.347 --> 56:26.014
Whoa!
Whoo!

56:26.016 --> 56:27.416
What just happened?

56:27.418 --> 56:28.917
Whoever's doing this has got

56:28.919 --> 56:32.121
A much more powerful
computer than we do.

56:32.123 --> 56:34.189
Whoa!

56:34.191 --> 56:35.524
Nick: What do we do now?

56:35.526 --> 56:37.059
Hold on!
Good idea!

56:37.061 --> 56:38.560
Ok, I know.

56:38.562 --> 56:40.996
I'll put in
the coordinates
for my house.

56:40.998 --> 56:43.031
Santa: You'd better hurry.

56:43.033 --> 56:45.667
Danny: Ok, here's
a stupid idea.

56:45.669 --> 56:47.469
Nick: I'm listening.

56:47.471 --> 56:49.238
We could...

56:49.240 --> 56:50.539
Cut the power off,

56:50.541 --> 56:52.374
Then throw it
back on real quick.

56:52.376 --> 56:54.810
That would stop the signal,

56:54.811 --> 56:57.245
But it could
also do some damage
to the hard drive.

56:57.248 --> 56:59.047
Who cares about the hard drive?

56:59.049 --> 57:00.916
It's our only choice.
Let's do it now

57:00.918 --> 57:03.619
Because we're
right over the mansion. Go.

57:05.156 --> 57:13.156
Both: Aaaaaaah!

57:14.565 --> 57:17.065
Don't you think
it's about time
we turn it back on?!

57:17.067 --> 57:20.469
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

57:20.471 --> 57:24.706
Yes! Ah ha ha ha ha!

57:24.708 --> 57:27.276
You did it! Whoo-hoo!

57:27.278 --> 57:31.146
Ok. We're still dropping,
but not as fast.

57:31.148 --> 57:33.215
Ok, easy, now. Easy.

57:33.217 --> 57:35.317
All right. I know.
I got it.

57:35.319 --> 57:36.351
Don't worry, don't worry.

57:36.353 --> 57:38.020
Easy!

57:38.022 --> 57:41.423
I got it, I got it.
I'm an ace.

57:41.425 --> 57:45.227
Ok. Good. We're safe.

57:45.229 --> 57:47.296
I almost lost my cookies.

57:47.298 --> 57:50.165
Shall we?
While the soup's still hot.

57:57.508 --> 58:00.242
I can't believe I lost them.

58:00.244 --> 58:03.679
I had them right in my hands.

58:03.681 --> 58:05.380
You know, I guess
it's just possible

58:05.382 --> 58:07.182
That my brother might be smarter

58:07.184 --> 58:09.251
Than I give him credit for.

58:11.055 --> 58:12.988
Nah.

58:12.990 --> 58:14.523
That's it.

58:14.525 --> 58:16.658
Your brother
has stolen my sleigh.

58:16.660 --> 58:19.761
He's obviously
in cahoots with
that uncle of yours.

58:19.763 --> 58:23.398
He's on the naughty list
for life.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.167
But that's not fair.

58:25.169 --> 58:27.135
You don't know danny, santa.

58:27.137 --> 58:30.239
He wouldn't steal it.
There's gotta be a reason.

58:30.241 --> 58:32.241
And I may well put in a call

58:32.243 --> 58:35.143
To my good old friend,
the easter bunny.

58:35.145 --> 58:38.480
The only way
that young man will
get eggs in his basket

58:38.482 --> 58:41.083
Is if he lays them himself.

58:41.752 --> 58:43.785
Whoa.

58:52.596 --> 58:54.763
Ohh, exquisite.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.565
Hmm. Ooh.

58:56.567 --> 58:59.368
What do we have here?

58:59.370 --> 59:01.470
Junk.

59:01.472 --> 59:04.039
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

59:05.743 --> 59:07.409
A bit early.

59:10.281 --> 59:12.381
Oops!

59:12.383 --> 59:14.750
Ohh, nicky likes.

59:14.752 --> 59:16.919
Boop!

59:16.920 --> 59:19.087
 Roop-boop-do-do-be-doo
do-do-de-doodly-doo 

59:19.089 --> 59:22.124
Hmm... Hmm... Ehh.

59:22.126 --> 59:25.260
Oh. Yes, yes.

59:25.262 --> 59:27.596
Ok.

59:27.598 --> 59:31.099
Still, there's
something wrong
with the <i> ensemble.</i>

59:31.101 --> 59:32.467
Oh!

59:32.469 --> 59:34.369
Of course.
The necklace.

59:34.371 --> 59:35.804
Allow me.

59:35.806 --> 59:39.741
How's it going in there, big d?

59:39.743 --> 59:41.577
Danny: Fine.

59:41.579 --> 59:42.611
Ha ha.

59:42.613 --> 59:45.314
Me, too!

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.509
It's still hot.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:21.116
Holy blitzen!

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.523
The vanderlip diamond.

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:30.692
<i>Pour moi?</i>

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:33.328
Ooh.

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.197
Oh-oh-oh.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:39.835
Oh, it is a merry christmas.

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:41.637
Excuse me?

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:43.405
Sorry?

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:44.773
Mmwah. Oh!

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:47.476
Heh heh.
Mrs. Vanderlip.

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:50.379
Tsk, tsk.
Naughty, naughty.

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:54.650
Oh, this really is exquisite.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.685
Uncle nick?

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:59.588
What are you doing?

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:01.456
I was just mingling.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:09.698
I thought there
was something fishy
about your lumpy stomach.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.833
There's stuff in there.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:16.304
Stuff? What stuff?

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:36.558
Uhh!

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:43.799
That stuff.

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:48.303
Oh, this stuff, heh.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:51.406
Yes, uh...

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:56.211
All right.
I'll be honest with you.

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.982
See,

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:03.719
I'm collecting items
for a charity fund-raiser

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:07.222
To help fight...
Bad things.

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:15.330
Aaaaaah!

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:18.500
Unh!

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.502
Ohh!

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:27.242
You don't have to lie anymore.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:30.746
I mean, I'm not that dense.

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:36.618
This whole night has
all been one big, fat setup.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.988
You scammed me
so you could steal stuff.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.891
No. Danny.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:45.660
Look, just, uh...

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.965
It is the giving season, right?

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:52.667
Now, just... just
think of it as...
as them

01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:55.670
Giving to the
less-fortunate, hmm?

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.009
Oh. Here.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:02.844
Have a stradivarius.

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:05.413
Go on, take it!

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.985
That's it.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:12.287
We're done.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:14.723
Ok.

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:16.424
You're right.

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:19.027
I promise, no more.

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:23.398
No, I mean you and me.
We're done.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.699
For good.

01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:30.806
Come on.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.340
Danny.

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:33.441
Heh heh heh.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:34.976
It's your uncle nick.

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:45.453
Nick: Yo, d-man,
where ya goin'?

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:47.489
D!

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:51.059
Whoa, danny!

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:53.428
Danny, danny,
danny. Hold on.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.896
Come on. Hey, hey.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:57.933
Ok, ok. All right.
You're right.

01:03:57.935 --> 01:03:59.701
I'll level with you, ok?

01:03:59.703 --> 01:04:05.373
It's just I've been having
a small cash flow problem.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:10.812
So... so this was just
a tide-me-over kind of
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:13.381
I mean, I really wouldn't
make too much out of this.

01:04:15.786 --> 01:04:18.787
All right. I'm sorry. Ok?

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:20.622
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:23.892
But, come on!
What would you have said?

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.493
I would've said,
"don't do it."

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:27.796
see?
That's my point.

01:04:27.798 --> 01:04:30.732
Ok. It's all good now.

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.402
Where to now?

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:37.105
Well, I'm going back home,

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:40.375
See if I can really help santa.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.446
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:04:44.448 --> 01:04:47.816
Yeah, right.

01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:49.651
That sounds good.

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:57.158
You're not coming back
with me, are you?

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.662
No, I, uh, I... No.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:02.964
No, I don't think
it's such a good idea.

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:05.934
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:08.503
But, hey. We will
definitely hook up, ok?

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:10.405
I'll give you a call.
We'll hook up.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:12.073
Ok? Heh heh.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.976
Dan, my man. Heh heh.

01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:17.812
All right, pal?

01:05:17.814 --> 01:05:18.880
Danny?

01:05:18.882 --> 01:05:20.415
What?

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.686
Hey, we still
have monaco, right?

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:15.003
Now what?

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.204
I don't know.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:19.140
Neither do I.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:23.478
It looks like christmas is over.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.783
What about you?
How will you get home?

01:06:28.785 --> 01:06:30.618
That's a good question.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:31.920
That's going to take
some figuring,

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:33.888
Thanks to your naughty brother.

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:36.024
But danny isn't naughty.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:37.192
He's not.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:39.728
Well, he's doing
a pretty good imitation.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:42.163
Ok, but what
if he gave you
your sleigh back

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.848
And said he was sorry?

01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:45.532
Would you
still keep him
on your bad list

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:47.068
And call the bunny?

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.837
Well, maybe not,

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:51.639
But that's not
too likely to happen,
now, is it?

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:54.709
Aaaaah!

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:00.515
Wha...

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.054
I knew you'd come back.

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:07.789
Uhh, hey. Peter?

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:08.923
Danny,

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:12.060
Santa's really mad at you.

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:15.597
Yeah, I had a feeling
he might be.

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:20.001
Well, what do you have
to say for yourself
now, danny?

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:22.604
Uh...

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.205
Merry christmas?

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:36.184
A screwdriver.

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:37.886
Screwdriver.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:43.058
Soldering iron.

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:45.693
Soldering iron.

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:49.064
Needle-nose pliers.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:53.668
Needle-nose
pliers.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.674
How's it going?

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:04.079
I don't even know
if I can fix this one, danny.

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:06.047
You really did it this time.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:12.320
Crescent wrench.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:13.855
Crescent wrench.

01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:35.009
Santa?

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:40.115
I owe you an apology.

01:08:41.685 --> 01:08:43.718
I'm sorry.

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:50.692
But I... I wasn't
trying to steal
your sleigh.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.229
I hope you believe me.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:58.966
Frankly, son, I don't know
what to believe anymore.

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:06.174
My uncle nick...

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:10.044
He's... He's
not really
a bad guy...

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:11.645
I guess.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.649
I mean... he's, uh...

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.318
He just got a
little over his
head this time,

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.321
And... and then
that's the way
it is.

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:23.191
He's just, uh...

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:24.658
A scammer?

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.094
Yeah.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:32.433
How does it feel
being the one scammed
this time?

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:37.138
Not good.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.216
Well, that's
the ball game, boys.

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:52.921
There's no way this puppy
is going anywhere else
anytime soon.

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:54.722
Your hard drive's totally fried.

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:56.357
I take it that's bad?

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.026
That's real bad.

01:09:58.028 --> 01:10:01.362
And the computer store
is closed all day tomorrow.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.699
The earliest I could get you up

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.202
Is sometime on the 26th.

01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:31.259
He'll be ok.

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:33.995
Kids rebound.
That's what they do.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:37.265
In a week he'll forget
about the whole thing.

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.267
Hey.

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:40.001
I'll send him a present.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:41.269
Something big.

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:42.737
A big...

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.406
Expensive...

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.142
Thing.

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.812
Ohhh.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:57.919
Hey. Hey, buddy.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.288
We're looking
for 300 walnut street.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:05.026
How far?

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:16.070
Let's go. It's gotta
be around here somewhere.

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:17.805
Get ready for this, eliot.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.007
Dinner time, boys.

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:20.975
Oh, yeah!

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:27.448
Ho ho, holy smoke,
that was close.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.983
Ha ha ha ha!

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:31.052
Ohh...

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:37.191
300... Walnut street?

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:49.937
Hey, santa.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:54.208
You gettin' in?

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:57.345
I...

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:01.582
All these years,

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:05.353
And I've never missed
a christmas delivery
until now.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.924
But maybe it's for the best.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:11.459
Maybe it'd do people good

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.828
To know what it's
like without santa.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:17.498
Maybe they'd
appreciate christmas
more.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.535
Appreciate me a little more.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.403
Yes.

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:25.106
Maybe I'll just take
a few years off.

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:27.508
You don't mean that?

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.143
Why not?

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:32.180
Everybody else
seems to be thinking
only of themselves.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:34.349
Maybe I'll just
give up and join them!

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:38.853
Why, maybe I'll take
this pasty old carcass
off to florida,

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.856
Let rudolph
rub sunblock on my back,

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.158
Sip an umbrella drink,

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.461
Listen to a steel band,

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:50.298
And let someone else
do the holiday
heavy lifting.

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:53.935
You think a tan would
make me look thinner?

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.903
But there isn't anyone else.

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:58.039
You're santa.

01:13:04.314 --> 01:13:07.281
Don't worry, son.

01:13:07.283 --> 01:13:09.550
Santa's just a little depressed.

01:13:11.321 --> 01:13:14.322
It's been one of those days.

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:16.090
Everything that could go wrong

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.925
Did go wrong.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:19.594
300 walnut street, bill!

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:20.895
Bill! Bill! Bill!
Stop the car!

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:21.996
Stop the... bill! Bill!

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:24.298
And is still going wrong.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.100
Bill! Bill!

01:13:26.102 --> 01:13:27.468
Put on the brakes!

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.604
That is the last time
I let you drive, bill.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:30.938
I can't see anything!

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.440
I don't care if you
can't see anything.

01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:35.009
That is the last time
I let you drive!

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:36.577
Get out of here!
Come on, let's go.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:38.045
Ok, where is he?

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:39.580
Yeah, where is nick wrigley,

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.516
The lying,
computer-hacking
little thief?!

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:43.217
He's not here.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:45.219
Don't give us
the runaround already!

01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:46.387
We know he's here!

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:47.488
Oh, yeah.
We tracked him

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.223
With a global
positioning
satellite.

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:51.025
And the gps don't lie.

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:53.227
The gps 1162?

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:54.362
Bill: You got it, girl.

01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:56.364
Well, he's...
He's still not here.

01:13:56.366 --> 01:13:58.266
Ok, who are you people?

01:13:58.268 --> 01:13:59.534
Nick is our uncle.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:02.336
He was here,
but now he's gone. Ok?

01:14:02.338 --> 01:14:03.538
So... so just move on.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.939
Listen!

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.408
We've been driving
around all night.

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:09.677
We're very upset.

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:11.412
Bill lost a contact lens.

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:13.014
It's inside my own head.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:14.415
I have a migraine.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:17.385
And eliot
hasn't hurt anyone
in over 5 hours.

01:14:17.387 --> 01:14:19.387
Now, we know he's in there.

01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:22.390
So either you
produce nick wrigley
right this second...

01:14:22.392 --> 01:14:24.292
Or we'll go in and find him,

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:27.195
Even if we have
to take this house
apart nail by nail.

01:14:27.197 --> 01:14:28.563
Shingle by shingle!

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:30.498
Limb by limb.

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.169
After you, eliot.

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:37.705
Santa: Hold on, now.
Wait a minute.

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:40.641
I think that the destruction
of this fine home

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.443
Will not solve your problem.

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:44.245
Now, in the spirit
of christmas...

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:47.081
Get out of the way, old man.

01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:51.452
Someone needs a tickle.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:03.998
Koochie-koochie-koochie
koochie-koochie!

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.335
Tickie-tickie-tickie
tickie-tickie-tick...

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:08.337
Eee...

01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:09.670
Eh...

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.672
Ahem.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:16.711
You're in trouble.

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:22.416
Nick: Leave them alone.

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:23.551
Harry: There he is!

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:26.087
Bill: Oh,
isn't that charming?

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:27.288
Nick wrigley
coming to the neighborhood,

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:29.557
Bringing the christmas cheer.

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:30.591
Oh.

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:32.560
Kicks the car door.

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.295
Love the santa suit, nick.

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:36.297
Also the little bag
of presents.
Cute, yeah.

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:37.698
I hope for your sake

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.167
There's a present worth
30,000 bucks in your bag.

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:42.270
Oh, I've got things
worth a lot more
than that.

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:43.704
Ha ha ha ha!
The man!

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.606
But I can't give them to you.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.341
Why not?

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:48.576
Well, first of all,

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:51.178
You 3 boys
have been very naughty.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.446
Secondly, they're...

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:54.048
Not mine to give.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:56.450
Oh, I thought it was
all mine for a while,

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:58.553
But, uh...

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:01.222
It's not worth
what I'd have to
give up to keep it,

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:02.723
So...

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.826
All these lovely things
have to go back

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:07.795
To the people they belong to.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:11.432
You better be kidding, wrigley.

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:14.135
No. No, I'm not.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:17.471
Eliot, he's all yours.

01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:20.541
Run, uncle nick!

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:22.076
Don't worry, peter.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.511
This guy won't hurt me.

01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:26.747
And why won't I hurt you?

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.349
'cause, frankly, eliot,

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:29.550
Deep inside,

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:33.120
You're just a scared,
unhappy little man.

01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:34.488
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:16:36.526 --> 01:16:38.225
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:39.627
Oh, yeah.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:41.095
Yeah.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.097
And because I have this.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.272
Ooh ha ha!

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.608
Ah ha ha!
There we go.

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:56.877
Ohh...

01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:05.820
Uh-oh.

01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:08.623
Did I mention "little"?

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:10.891
Uh... Uh... Uh...

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.631
Mommy.

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:25.339
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.807
Remember, he's makin' a list!

01:17:45.728 --> 01:17:47.595
Yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk.

01:17:47.597 --> 01:17:48.796
Come here.

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:50.398
Ha ha ha ha!

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.832
Peter!

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:01.175
Good job, nick.

01:18:02.412 --> 01:18:03.944
Oh. Here.

01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:06.480
Thank you.

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:11.752
Ho ho ho ho ho...

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:19.360
Santa: Ah, come here.

01:18:21.898 --> 01:18:24.498
Very touching, you guys.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.734
But this whole love fest

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:28.569
Doesn't exactly
solve our problems.

01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:29.804
What problems?

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:31.372
The sleigh is broken.

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:34.241
You two jerks blew out
the on-board computer.

01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:35.910
Oh, yeah, right.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:37.778
Yeah.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.247
What about hooking up
one of our computers?

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:41.782
Great, but how long
an extension cord

01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:44.618
Do you think you'd need
to fly to the north pole?

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:47.988
Would a powerful laptop work?

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.491
Maybe.

01:18:54.464 --> 01:18:56.397
Oh, no.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.365
No.

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:00.468
Not lappy.

01:19:10.646 --> 01:19:14.014
Ho ho ho ho ho!

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:15.649
Thank you, kaitlin.

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:18.486
Ho ho ho ho ho...

01:19:18.488 --> 01:19:20.855
And, nick, thank you for lappy.

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:23.724
This has been
a very good first step

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:25.893
On your long road
to rehabilitation.

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:28.662
Wait.
How long do I...

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:30.531
All right.

01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:31.932
Anyway, it's about time

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.534
You got something for christmas

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:34.802
Besides milk and cookies.

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:39.406
And I'll take care
of your returns for you.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:41.709
Unless, of course,
you'd care to come along

01:19:41.711 --> 01:19:42.910
And do it yourself?

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:43.912
Uh, santa,

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:45.546
I'm sorry about that,

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:46.947
But, uh...

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.784
We need uncle nick here.

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:51.418
'cause, uh, what's christmas

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.554
Without a family
to celebrate it
with?

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:56.824
Well, in that case,
I'd better be going.

01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:58.692
Now, remember,

01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:01.428
You gotta keep this
under your hats, all right?

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.597
Not a word to anyone.

01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:05.299
Right?

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.501
Ok.

01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:13.440
You know, I'm going
to have to reconsider

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:16.310
This whole "naughty
and nice" tradition.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.979
It's not as black and white
as I thought.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.782
And I have you wrigleys
to thank for that.

01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:24.819
Well, merry christmas.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.053
Kids: Merry christmas.

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:27.721
Nick: Merry christmas,
santa.

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:31.325
Well?

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:32.726
Give us some room!

01:20:32.728 --> 01:20:34.061
Ooh.
Oh.

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:35.996
Sorry.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.900
Danny: Bye, santa!

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:39.901
Kaitlin: Bye, santa.

01:21:05.995 --> 01:21:07.828
"not a creature was stirring,

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.096
Not even a mouse."

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:10.764
Boy, do I feel silly.

01:21:10.766 --> 01:21:12.867
Just a second.

01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:37.458

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:39.927

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:35.582

01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:45.960

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:49.063

01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:50.564

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:06.080
Danny: I... I didn't know

01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:18.759
Peter: Uncle nick,
I found one for you.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:19.761
For me?

01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:20.762
Yeah.

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:22.196
Ok. Great.

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:23.697
Toss it.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.601
Uhh!

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:30.704
Gee, it's too big.

01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:33.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, pal.

01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:38.645
Nick: Oh, wow.

01:23:39.749 --> 01:23:42.282
It's my guitar.

01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:45.886
The one from
mccusack's music store.

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:47.521
Kaitlin:
Oh, look, a card.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:49.289
You forgot to read it.

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:54.028
"to my favorite naughty boy.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.629
"sorry for the delay,

01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:57.765
"but better late than never.

01:23:57.767 --> 01:23:59.767
Love, santa."

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:12.846
Oh.

01:24:12.848 --> 01:24:14.882
Play it, uncle nick.

01:24:14.884 --> 01:24:17.017

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.120
John: Come on,

01:24:20.122 --> 01:24:21.789
All: Come on.

01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:23.791
Peter: Please?

01:24:26.962 --> 01:24:29.830
No. No, actually
I better not.

01:24:29.832 --> 01:24:32.066
I'm gonna have to sell this ax

01:24:32.068 --> 01:24:33.634
To pay off some of my debts.

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:36.970
Well, you're not
gonna sell it today.

01:24:36.972 --> 01:24:38.138
So, come on, big rock star,

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.590
Let's see what you got.

01:24:39.591 --> 01:24:41.041
Yeah, come on.
The kids have never
heard you play.

01:24:41.043 --> 01:24:43.143
Come on, everybody,
let's go. Come on!

01:24:43.145 --> 01:24:44.711
To the sofa.

01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:45.946
John: Everybody
on the sofa.

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:47.014
All right.

01:24:47.016 --> 01:24:48.916
Peter: Come on
on the sofa!

01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:51.785
Oh! That's great.

01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:56.156
John: Yeah!

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:57.925
Abby: Whoo!

01:25:04.233 --> 01:25:07.301
Ok, it's, uh...

01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:09.002
Been a little while
since I've...

01:25:09.004 --> 01:25:10.938
Oh, come on.
Rock and roll!

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.306
No excuses.

01:25:36.365 --> 01:25:37.998
Yeah!

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.267
Whoo!

01:25:40.269 --> 01:25:41.802
All right!

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:50.677
Oh, what a hot dog.
What a hot dog.

01:25:50.679 --> 01:25:51.679
John: Whoo!

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.381
Abby: Whoo! Yeah!

01:25:54.383 --> 01:25:57.351
John: Go, nick!
Go, nick! Go, nick!

01:25:57.353 --> 01:25:58.986
Whoo!

01:26:02.858 --> 01:26:05.359
Danny: 'twas the morning
<i>of</i> christmas,

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:07.961
The end of our tale.

01:26:07.963 --> 01:26:10.864
Santa brought
all the stuff back,

01:26:10.866 --> 01:26:14.968
My uncle nick didn't go to jail.

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:18.405
And I've learned
the best gift of christmas,

01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:20.374
Comes at no price.

01:26:20.376 --> 01:26:23.277
It's to be with your family,

01:26:23.279 --> 01:26:26.980
Whether you're naughty or nice.

01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:31.318
So that's the end of our story.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.154
Merry christmas, everyone.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:53.273
 I saw santa
on the roof of my house 

01:26:53.275 --> 01:26:55.909
 he was having trouble
with his sleigh 

01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:57.744
 so I gave him a push 

01:26:57.746 --> 01:26:59.246
 and his sled
started flying 

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:01.848
 and this is
what santa said 

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:05.185
 he said, "hey, little boy,
what do you need?" 

01:27:05.187 --> 01:27:13.187
 santa I want everything,
give it to me 

01:27:26.175 --> 01:27:27.941
 he said,
"what do you want 

01:27:27.943 --> 01:27:29.409
 under your tree?" 

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:33.080
 santa I want everything,
give it to me
