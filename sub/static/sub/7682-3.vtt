00:53.667 --> 00:56.124
Growing up 1,500 miles
away from the ocean,

00:56.125 --> 01:00.118
you hardly ever get
a really good sea breeze.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.116
So, for a Minnesota boy
like me,

01:02.667 --> 01:05.659
living on the water
was kind of perfect.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.658
And, as it happened,

01:07.667 --> 01:11.159
my next door neighbor
was a fringe benefit.

01:11.166 --> 01:13.157
MacGyver, still on
for dinner tonight?

01:13.166 --> 01:14.656
I'll be there.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.658
That's what you said last time.

01:16.667 --> 01:19.158
No last minute excuses
this time, I promise.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.157
MacGyver?

01:22.667 --> 01:24.703
Then again...

01:28.166 --> 01:29.155
Ah, good morning, Pete.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.702
Morning.

01:30.709 --> 01:31.698
I think we've got a problem.

01:31.709 --> 01:34.155
Look at this.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.702
That's Jimmy Kendall.

01:35.709 --> 01:36.698
The one and only.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.700
I mean, we break
our backs to get him

01:38.709 --> 01:40.165
in the witness
Protection Program.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.702
we even had a
funeral for the man!

01:41.709 --> 01:43.700
And here he is
with his picture in the paper.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.700
This had
to have been an accident.

01:45.709 --> 01:47.199
Accident or not,

01:47.208 --> 01:48.698
there he is in all his glory.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.197
If Papa Chuck Banning

01:50.208 --> 01:51.698
and his syndicate buddies
see this,

01:51.709 --> 01:54.200
after all the information
Jimmy gave the government,

01:54.208 --> 01:56.199
they're gonna make sure
he's dead this time.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.698
we got to get to him.

01:57.709 --> 01:58.698
well, I've already tried.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.199
He's on a bus
with his baseball team.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.698
They're due to arrive

02:01.709 --> 02:03.199
at Shoreline Stadium
this morning.

02:03.208 --> 02:05.199
I can be there in about an hour.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.744
Yeah, well, all right,
but be careful.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.739
Remember, if he's in

02:07.750 --> 02:09.741
the target zone, so are you!

02:29.250 --> 02:30.740
...A chorus here.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.740
I want to hear a chorus.
Let's go.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.240
- Hey, Lou?
- what?

02:38.250 --> 02:40.241
You remember to
bring my new batting
gloves this time?

02:40.250 --> 02:42.241
Listen to this...
he's batting 198.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.241
You haven't worn out
the old ones yet,

02:44.792 --> 02:45.781
for crying out loud.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.783
Don't worry, I'll have 'em there
for the series.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.248
You worry
about using the equipment.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.786
Bringing it is my job.

02:50.792 --> 02:51.781
Got it there, Dave?

02:51.792 --> 02:53.248
Okay.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.786
Come on, guys, let's go,
let's do it.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.248
PLAYER:
Think we can hit one
off the top?

02:56.250 --> 02:57.786
Let's do it, guys, come on.

02:57.792 --> 02:58.781
Yeah, sure.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.783
when your grandma's

03:00.792 --> 03:01.781
pitching.

03:01.792 --> 03:03.248
Let's do it guys, come on.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.282
wow!

03:12.291 --> 03:14.782
Sure wasn't anything
like this where I grew up.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.282
Back in New York,
where I come from,

03:16.291 --> 03:18.282
this is just an overgrown
hot dog stand.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.782
Lou, they say it seats 60,000.

03:20.792 --> 03:24.831
In my whole hometown,
there's only 482 people.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.826
Dave, you getting
the jitters?

03:27.834 --> 03:30.280
Fans... I don't know...
they're like elevator music.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.828
After the first pitch,
you don't even notice them.

03:32.834 --> 03:34.825
I sure hope so.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.825
You've been mowing 'em
down since high school.

03:36.834 --> 03:38.290
It's the same game.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.825
And you've got
a rifle there.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.290
Pitch the way I
know that you can,

03:42.834 --> 03:44.825
and we murder them.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.324
Ralph, it's
probably nothing.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.869
Relax.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.866
Papa Chuck's hardly cold
in his grave,

04:13.875 --> 04:15.866
and the man calls me out here
for a meeting?

04:15.875 --> 04:18.332
How can I relax?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.366
I got word after the funeral

04:49.375 --> 04:51.366
you wanted to see me,
Mr. webber.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.374
Nice service, don't you think?

04:56.917 --> 04:58.373
Yeah, it was a great send-off.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.911
Papa Chuck would have liked it.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.908
I suppose we could have talked
at the cemetery,

05:05.917 --> 05:08.909
but I don't like doing
business among the dead.

05:09.417 --> 05:10.907
It's disrespectful.

05:10.917 --> 05:11.906
Don't you agree, Ralph?

05:11.917 --> 05:13.407
Oh, absolutely.

05:13.417 --> 05:14.907
I'm the same way myself,
Mr. webber.

05:14.917 --> 05:17.909
Please, call me Paul.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.908
So, uh, what did you want
to talk to me about,

05:19.917 --> 05:21.908
Mr. webber, Paul?

05:21.917 --> 05:24.408
Now that Papa Chuck is dead,

05:24.417 --> 05:25.953
we have to move ahead.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.950
we have to move forward.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.408
You did a nice job
with the truckers.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.953
You kept our
merchandise moving.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.415
we notice, don't
think we don't.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.408
Just doing my job.

05:35.417 --> 05:36.406
And efficiency.

05:36.959 --> 05:37.948
That's always prized, Ralph.

05:37.959 --> 05:40.416
Like that Union President
at the Cargo Haulers.

05:40.417 --> 05:41.953
- what was his name?
- Malkovich.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.415
Yeah, Malkovich.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.453
The guy was a troublemaker.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.948
So he disappears.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.449
No fuss, no traces. Nice.

05:48.458 --> 05:50.449
And Jimmy the Eraser.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.949
He caused us difficulty.

05:52.959 --> 05:54.950
would have caused
more until you took him out.

05:54.959 --> 05:55.948
we appreciate that.

05:55.959 --> 05:57.449
Just doing my job.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.449
Yeah, and doing it well.

05:59.458 --> 06:02.450
Now with Papa Chuck...
God rest his soul...

06:02.458 --> 06:04.449
no longer with us,
we'd like you

06:04.458 --> 06:06.995
to accept some
additional responsibilities

06:07.001 --> 06:08.457
with additional rewards.

06:09.001 --> 06:10.992
we're thinking
that you can take on some

06:11.001 --> 06:12.457
of Papa Chuck's action.

06:12.458 --> 06:13.994
Hey Paul, just
give me a chance.

06:14.001 --> 06:15.457
I'll do the
Family proud.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.994
I'm certain you will.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.457
Now, we're gonna
start you off small,

06:18.458 --> 06:19.447
see how it goes.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.994
Now, as you know,
the Family's

06:21.001 --> 06:22.992
buying into high-tech
operations.

06:23.001 --> 06:24.491
we have a computerized...

06:24.500 --> 06:26.491
Ralph... we got to talk.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.489
Not now, Sal.

06:28.001 --> 06:28.990
Trust me, it's important.

06:29.001 --> 06:30.992
I'm talking business
with the man!

06:34.500 --> 06:36.491
As you were saying, Paul.

06:40.001 --> 06:41.992
we have a new
computerized freight service

06:42.001 --> 06:43.992
that we're offering
to the shipping companies.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.492
Some of them don't realize
they need our help.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.491
I'll talk to them.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.990
You talk to them.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.992
Make them understand.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.490
Papa Chuck was a good man,

06:56.500 --> 06:59.492
we're gonna miss him,
but, uh, last few years, he

06:59.500 --> 07:00.990
let things slide.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.992
I'll do whatever it takes.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.991
I know you will.

07:17.000 --> 07:17.989
Are you nuts?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.536
The Family finally gives me
the nod,

07:19.542 --> 07:20.998
and you come interrupting
with your

07:21.000 --> 07:21.989
nonsense.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.536
we got big trouble.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.533
Jimmy the Eraser...
he ain't dead.

07:25.542 --> 07:26.531
Oh, you see what I mean?

07:26.542 --> 07:28.032
Now that is nonsense.

07:28.041 --> 07:29.030
I did that hit myself.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.533
Today's paper
says you didn't.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.531
It can't be.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.032
It's got to be an old picture.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.531
He calls himself Lou Rizzo.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.033
He's with a Triple-A team
in the playoffs at

07:41.041 --> 07:42.030
Shoreline Stadium.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.030
I can't believe this!

07:43.041 --> 07:44.577
If the Family finds out,

07:44.583 --> 07:46.039
we're dead.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.577
what are you
gonna do about it?

07:47.583 --> 07:50.575
This time, I'm gonna put him
in the ground myself.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.074
There you go.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.574
Listen up, guys,
that's enough.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.573
Fast, guy.
Going faster.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.073
Right over
the plate.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.573
Get it, get it!

08:19.583 --> 08:22.074
Nice swing, Charlie.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.573
Mix 'em up.

08:23.583 --> 08:26.074
You need to loosen up, Dave.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.619
what I need
is an arm transplant.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.081
It's not

08:29.083 --> 08:30.072
your arm.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.073
Next batter!

08:38.625 --> 08:41.616
That's Hank Aaron!

08:41.625 --> 08:43.616
Pitcher never knows
who he's gonna face.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.616
He's a pal of the coach's,

08:45.625 --> 08:47.616
and he's here
to give out
batting tips.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.115
So, have a good time.

08:49.125 --> 08:50.114
Blow it

08:50.125 --> 08:52.116
right past him.

08:53.625 --> 08:56.116
Let's go, kid.
Let me see what
you got there.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.116
Right over the plate, Dave,
right over the plate.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.114
Throw it by him, Dave.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.114
Do your stuff, Hank.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.615
Don't let him see anything.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.614
Throw it by him, Dave.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.661
Right in my glove,
right in my glove.

09:04.667 --> 09:05.656
Yeah!
Ooh!

09:07.667 --> 09:09.123
Look at that.
Throw much higher

09:09.125 --> 09:10.114
from Aaron.
whoa!

09:10.667 --> 09:11.656
whoa!

09:13.125 --> 09:14.661
Pitch like that in the playoffs,

09:15.125 --> 09:17.662
and you're gonna be taking
a shower by the third inning.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.123
But he was the greatest!

09:19.125 --> 09:21.116
I mean, the all time
home run king.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.661
He hit 755 of 'em.

09:22.667 --> 09:23.656
I know,

09:24.166 --> 09:25.155
and he's a legend,

09:25.667 --> 09:27.658
and he eats pitchers
for breakfast.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.158
Come on, he's human.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.157
And this stadium is just

09:32.166 --> 09:33.656
another ballpark.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.157
Now, you got one

09:35.166 --> 09:37.657
of the best arms
I've ever seen.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.658
Use it.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.702
Right in the glove, baby.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.698
Right in the glove.

09:52.166 --> 09:54.703
Right in my glove, Dave,
right in my glove.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.700
Come on, come on,
give it to me, give it to me!

09:56.709 --> 09:57.698
Yeah!

09:57.709 --> 09:59.165
That's it!

09:59.166 --> 10:00.155
Pretty good fast ball there,
huh?

10:01.709 --> 10:02.698
That's it. Come on,

10:02.709 --> 10:03.698
keep it alive

10:03.709 --> 10:04.698
out there, let's go.

10:06.709 --> 10:07.698
My man, David, my man.

10:07.709 --> 10:08.698
One more time,
come on, David.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.199
One more time,
one more time.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.698
David, I like it,
I like it!

10:12.709 --> 10:15.200
Good arm, Davey!

10:17.709 --> 10:19.199
we got another ballplayer.

10:21.709 --> 10:22.698
Throw the strike, Davey.
Come on, Davey.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.199
Come on, Babe,
whatever you want.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.197
Your career's
on the line.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.199
Yeah!

10:39.750 --> 10:41.741
Okay, everybody
in the locker room.

10:43.750 --> 10:44.739
Let's go.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.741
I'm supposed
to give you 20 years worth

10:46.750 --> 10:48.240
of experience in 20 minutes.
Let's go!

10:48.250 --> 10:50.241
way to throw the ball, David!

10:50.250 --> 10:51.740
way to throw the ball!

10:51.750 --> 10:52.739
Let's go,
let's go!

10:52.750 --> 10:53.739
wow! Yeah!

10:53.750 --> 10:54.739
Hustle up, Charlie!

10:57.750 --> 10:59.741
Did I just strike out
Hank Aaron?

10:59.750 --> 11:01.240
Like I said, set 'em up,

11:01.250 --> 11:02.239
and mow 'em down.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.740
It's easy.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.785
Thanks, Lou.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.783
Like the heat, David.

11:06.792 --> 11:07.781
Like the heat.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.781
Let's play.

11:12.792 --> 11:13.781
Hello, Jimmy.

11:14.792 --> 11:17.249
MacGyver?

11:24.792 --> 11:26.282
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

11:26.291 --> 11:27.280
how you doing?

11:27.291 --> 11:29.282
Doing good.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.282
MacGyver, what are
you doing here?

11:31.291 --> 11:35.284
Unfortunately, I'm here to talk
to you about your future.

11:35.291 --> 11:37.282
Take a look.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.282
I told that guy,
I told him, I said,

11:42.291 --> 11:44.828
"Take pictures
of the kid, keep
me out of it."

11:44.834 --> 11:46.290
Damn!

11:46.834 --> 11:48.290
Can we find a place to talk?

11:48.291 --> 11:51.283
Yeah, let's
go up here.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.823
The timing couldn't be worse.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.825
I finally got everything going
for me.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.324
Now this could screw it up.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.824
Jimmy, it
already has.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.324
Remember Pete Thornton?

12:23.333 --> 12:24.322
Yeah.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.324
He's working on a
new identity for you.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.324
- No!
- It's got to be.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.322
I got a good life here.

12:29.875 --> 12:30.864
It's working for me.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.864
I'm Lou Rizzo.

12:31.875 --> 12:33.331
Nobody'll even

12:33.333 --> 12:34.322
notice this.

12:34.333 --> 12:35.869
I did, Pete did.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.866
we can't take the chance.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.324
You gave testimony.

12:42.333 --> 12:43.869
You hurt the Family.

12:43.875 --> 12:45.866
They're not gonna forget it.

12:45.875 --> 12:49.367
Supposing I dye my hair,
grow a mustache, wear lifts?

12:49.875 --> 12:52.867
I mean, mugs like mine
are a dime a dozen.

12:52.875 --> 12:56.367
would Jimmy the Eraser fall
for that?

12:56.375 --> 12:58.366
All right, okay.

12:58.375 --> 12:59.865
I get your point.

12:59.875 --> 13:00.864
Good.

13:05.375 --> 13:07.366
There he is!

13:07.375 --> 13:08.364
Come on.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.911
Come on!

13:29.417 --> 13:31.908
Come on, in here.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.910
This is not the place
where I want to cash in.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.950
Hey, Jimmy!

13:54.959 --> 13:56.950
You look a little flushed.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.447
In the old days,

14:15.458 --> 14:17.449
I would have had
a piece to even up

14:17.458 --> 14:18.447
the odds.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.948
That's not the only way.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.450
Yeah. And a couple
of grenades, too.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.992
That mop is not gonna
hold them long.

14:30.001 --> 14:31.992
Sometimes you just
have to think positive.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.992
Okay, I'm positive
we're dead.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.994
what are you doing
with that hose?

14:43.001 --> 14:45.993
we're taking the express
route out of here.

14:46.001 --> 14:46.990
Hit it!

14:48.001 --> 14:48.990
Come on, hit it!

14:56.500 --> 14:57.990
All right, come on, grab on.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.489
You got to be kidding.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.491
You expect me
to ride that thing?

15:01.500 --> 15:03.491
Not a chance.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.491
On second thought...

15:30.542 --> 15:31.998
we lost 'em.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.991
Not for long.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.992
I've got a hook in Jimmy,
and I'm gonna reel him in.

15:37.000 --> 15:37.989
with what?

15:38.542 --> 15:40.533
His daughter.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.032
Tonight I was going to play

15:50.041 --> 15:53.033
some five card stud
with Hank Aaron and trade lies.

15:53.041 --> 15:55.032
One lousy picture
in the paper,

15:55.041 --> 15:56.531
and it's allhasta manana.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.030
well, you know, Jimmy,

15:58.041 --> 16:01.033
sometimes we all have to...

16:02.542 --> 16:04.578
change our plans.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.574
This is it?

16:13.583 --> 16:15.039
This is where you live?

16:15.041 --> 16:16.030
Yeah. what's wrong with it?

16:16.041 --> 16:18.578
It's a houseboat.

16:18.583 --> 16:19.572
It's gonna sink.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.039
I'll get you a life jacket.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.574
Come on.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.074
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, yourself.

16:35.083 --> 16:38.575
Hey, you played today!

16:38.583 --> 16:40.574
Almost.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.073
The coach said he'd let me in

16:42.083 --> 16:43.072
if the score wasn't too close.

16:43.583 --> 16:44.618
But it was.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.616
we lost seven to six.

16:46.625 --> 16:48.081
well, Brian, if you didn't play,

16:48.083 --> 16:50.620
how did you get
your uniform so dirty?

16:50.625 --> 16:53.082
After the game was over
and everybody left,

16:53.083 --> 16:56.075
I slid into second
base a couple of times.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.074
- why?
- 'Cause...

16:58.083 --> 17:00.074
I didn't want people
to see me come home

17:00.083 --> 17:01.072
in a clean uniform again.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.074
Honey, you hang in there.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.619
You're going to get your chance.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.116
Yeah, right, Mom. Thanks.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.114
Susan?

17:18.125 --> 17:21.117
I've got a message
from your father.

17:21.125 --> 17:24.117
The police find anything
at the stadium?

17:24.125 --> 17:25.661
Nothing.

17:25.666 --> 17:27.657
They got there fast,
but not fast enough.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.123
Everyone was gone.

17:29.125 --> 17:32.663
I've asked the detectives
to keep the investigation quiet.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.123
You know, Jimmy,
with your low profile,

17:34.125 --> 17:36.116
you need a press agent.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.116
what the hell's the difference?

17:38.125 --> 17:39.661
Ralph knows I'm alive.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.658
Yeah, but the point is,
only Ralph and Sal know.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.123
You said yourself
they can't afford

17:43.125 --> 17:44.114
to have the Family find out.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.662
All right,
so what we have to deal with

17:46.667 --> 17:47.656
is Ralph and company.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.158
If you will just stay
out of the limelight.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.657
They're never going
to find you in Montana.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.658
Montana?!
what the hell's in Montana?!

17:54.667 --> 17:56.157
Buffalo chips and blizzards.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.656
why not Miami?

17:57.667 --> 17:59.157
You like it warm, you get snow.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.656
You like the beach,
you climb a mountain.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.155
You like baseball,

18:02.166 --> 18:03.155
you take up golf.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.157
Jimmy, I'm sorry,
but I'm serious.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.703
This has got to be a totally
different life for you.

18:08.709 --> 18:11.701
It's almost not worth it.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.701
well, the alternative
is not worth much either, is it?

18:14.709 --> 18:17.701
Think about it.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.700
Come on, Jimmy,
it's not going to be that bad.

18:19.709 --> 18:21.700
we're going to get you
everything you need.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.701
what I need, you can't get me!

18:24.709 --> 18:26.199
You mind if I use the phone?

18:26.208 --> 18:28.699
what for?

18:28.709 --> 18:31.200
The game's tomorrow,
and Dave, our starting pitcher,

18:31.208 --> 18:33.699
will be a basket case
if I'm not there for him.

18:33.709 --> 18:36.701
Okay. One call, all right?

18:36.709 --> 18:38.199
Do me a favor?

18:38.709 --> 18:41.200
Don't say anything
about where you are.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.199
Keep an eye on him.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.744
He's in bad shape.

18:52.750 --> 18:53.739
Yeah, I'll stay close.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.207
Just get things
in the works, all right?

18:58.208 --> 18:59.744
I'll be in touch soon, Jimmy.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.207
Hello? Locker room, please.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.240
Dave Malone.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.241
Jimmy? I'm just going
to take a shower.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.242
Hey, Dave, how you doing, kid?

19:15.250 --> 19:16.740
This is Lou.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.742
Yeah, listen, I'm sorry
I had to blast off on you, kid.

19:19.750 --> 19:20.739
So, how you feeling? Tell me.

19:20.750 --> 19:24.789
I'm okay. Listen, we got a call
here at the locker room.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.249
A guy named Ralph said he wanted
to get together with you.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.783
I didn't know
you had a daughter, Lou.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.249
Uh, what did he say about her?

19:32.250 --> 19:33.786
Nothing.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.783
Just said
he's with her and your grandson.

19:35.792 --> 19:38.249
"Grandson"?

19:40.250 --> 19:43.242
Lou?

19:43.250 --> 19:44.239
Lou?

19:44.250 --> 19:45.786
Uh-uh, yeah.

19:45.792 --> 19:48.283
Uh, listen, uh, Dave,
did he leave a number?

19:48.291 --> 19:49.781
Yeah.

19:49.792 --> 19:52.283
555-4698.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.282
wait, wait, wait, wait,
hold it.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.282
Okay, 555...

19:59.291 --> 20:00.280
...4698.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.282
4698.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.781
Said for you to call right away.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.282
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.282
Listen, uh, Dave, you take care,
and I'll be in touch, okay?

20:07.291 --> 20:08.280
Yeah.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.827
Okay, good luck, kid.

20:09.834 --> 20:10.823
Everything okay

20:10.834 --> 20:12.290
with your pitcher, Jimmy?

20:12.291 --> 20:14.282
Uh, oh, yeah, he's fine.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.829
You know what happened, though,
was the, uh, the third baseman...

20:17.834 --> 20:20.280
he got a... a hamstring pulled,
and...

20:20.291 --> 20:23.283
So, anyway, I'm gonna give him
a call at the hospital.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.325
Yeah, go ahead.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.824
Ralph.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.825
Hey, Jimmy, I've been
waiting for your call.

20:41.834 --> 20:44.325
what's this about my daughter,
Ralph?

20:44.333 --> 20:47.871
You sound pretty good for a guy
who's supposed to be fertilizer.

20:47.875 --> 20:48.864
Answer me.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.871
Okay. I'll answer you.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.866
You got an old debt to pay.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.322
Your daughter's sitting

20:56.333 --> 20:58.324
right here hoping
you make good.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.869
So is your grandson.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.866
Cute little kid.

21:01.875 --> 21:06.369
This is not the way
the game is played, Ralph.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.865
It is today, Jimmy.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.866
So, come and get 'em.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.866
Papa Chuck's
old cannery operation.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.365
You remember the place.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.364
Yeah, I remember.

21:14.375 --> 21:16.366
Good.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.364
well, anyway, kid,

21:19.375 --> 21:21.866
you just keep up
that positive attitude,

21:21.875 --> 21:24.366
and then you'll be out of there
in no time flat.

21:24.375 --> 21:26.366
And I'll be talking to you,
okay?

21:29.917 --> 21:31.908
Ah, he's gonna be fine.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.366
Just needs a little rest.

21:44.917 --> 21:47.408
Hey, Jimmy, I know
it's going to be tough.

21:47.417 --> 21:48.907
You're going to miss 'em all.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.407
But it's got to be this way.

21:51.917 --> 21:54.408
Yeah, I guess it does.

21:54.417 --> 21:56.908
You know, this is going
to sound kind of funny,

21:56.917 --> 21:59.909
but I remember when I was a kid,
I used to go to church.

21:59.917 --> 22:03.409
Take care of my troubles,
you know? Confession.

22:03.417 --> 22:05.408
Doesn't sound funny to me.

22:05.417 --> 22:08.409
I used to know a priest
in this town.

22:08.959 --> 22:10.950
If he's still in business.

22:10.959 --> 22:12.415
You mind?

22:12.417 --> 22:15.409
Go ahead.

22:23.417 --> 22:27.456
Hello? Father Kowalski?

22:27.458 --> 22:29.449
Jimmy Kendall.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.948
Remember me?

22:30.959 --> 22:32.950
Good.

22:32.959 --> 22:35.951
But then again, not so good.

22:35.959 --> 22:38.450
It's a trying time for me,
Father.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.449
I'd kind of like to see you.

22:40.458 --> 22:43.450
Talk to you about it.

22:43.458 --> 22:47.451
Maybe you could give me
a little peace.

22:48.001 --> 22:50.447
That's real nice of you, Father.

22:50.458 --> 22:52.449
Thanks a lot.

22:56.001 --> 22:58.447
Let's go to church.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.492
I got to admit,
it's been a long time.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.990
wait over here.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.490
I'm going to go
into the confessional.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.992
Padre'll probably give me
about 500 Hail Marys to say.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.999
Are you there, Father?

24:00.542 --> 24:02.533
I heard you
were dead, Jimmy.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.531
where you been?

24:03.542 --> 24:05.032
Living another life.

24:05.041 --> 24:06.030
You got it for me?

24:06.041 --> 24:10.535
The gospel according
to Smith and wesson.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.661
So...

25:30.667 --> 25:32.157
what's going on, Jimmy?

25:32.166 --> 25:34.157
what do you mean,
"what's going on? "

25:34.166 --> 25:35.155
Your friend,

25:35.166 --> 25:36.155
Father Kowalski,

25:36.166 --> 25:38.657
just walked by this altar
without genuflecting.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.659
That was no priest.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.157
And what is this?

25:47.166 --> 25:48.155
what are you doing with that?

25:48.166 --> 25:49.656
Sooner or later,

25:49.667 --> 25:51.703
a guy's got to take care
of his own business,

25:51.709 --> 25:52.698
know what I mean?

25:52.709 --> 25:54.165
Jimmy, it won't work.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.155
You told me yourself,

25:55.166 --> 25:56.155
they never stop

25:56.166 --> 25:57.702
looking for you.

26:00.166 --> 26:03.704
They snatched...

26:03.709 --> 26:05.700
my daughter...

26:05.709 --> 26:08.155
and my grandson.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.157
what?

26:11.166 --> 26:13.703
I didn't even know
I had a grandson

26:13.709 --> 26:15.700
till somebody took him away.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.200
That's what all
those phone calls were about?

26:20.208 --> 26:22.699
They want me,
and they want me alone.

26:22.709 --> 26:24.700
Otherwise the family's dead.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.701
Oh, Jimmy,
why didn't you tell me?

26:28.709 --> 26:29.698
what for?

26:30.208 --> 26:31.197
You'd just call the cops.

26:31.208 --> 26:33.199
That's not a bad idea!

26:33.208 --> 26:34.744
No.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.206
It boils down to me and them.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.197
Nobody else knows about this,

26:37.208 --> 26:39.199
and nobody else
is gonna know about it.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.197
Jimmy...

26:40.208 --> 26:42.199
They're just gonna kill you.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.207
I know.

26:45.208 --> 26:48.746
But if Susan and the kid
could get out safely,

26:48.750 --> 26:51.742
I really don't care
what happens.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.741
All right, look,

26:53.750 --> 26:54.739
no police, I promise.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.240
But you got to tell me
where they are.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.239
I'll go with you.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.739
No.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.739
My war, my family.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.741
what, a friend can't help?

27:01.750 --> 27:04.241
Boy, you're really thick-headed,
you know that?

27:04.750 --> 27:06.240
You know something,
you're right.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.740
Let's go get your family.

27:10.750 --> 27:13.787
I just don't want
to see you getting hurt,

27:13.792 --> 27:15.248
know what I mean?

27:18.792 --> 27:20.248
Sorry, buddy.

28:24.834 --> 28:25.823
Hello?

28:25.834 --> 28:26.823
Pete, it's Mac.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.825
- Yeah, what's up?
- Jimmy got away.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.825
- what? How?
- I'll explain later.

28:30.834 --> 28:31.869
what I need right now

28:31.875 --> 28:32.864
is to check
the reverse directory

28:32.875 --> 28:34.331
for an address
on this phone number.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.322
Okay, shoot.

28:35.333 --> 28:37.870
555-4698.

28:37.875 --> 28:38.864
Got it.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.866
what are you doing
standing around?

28:52.875 --> 28:54.866
You told me to look for him,

28:54.875 --> 28:56.365
I'm looking for him.

28:56.375 --> 28:58.366
You're standing in here
holding up the walls,

28:58.375 --> 29:00.366
and Jimmy the Eraser
is coming to get his kid.

29:00.375 --> 29:01.865
You forget who he is?

29:01.875 --> 29:03.365
Get outside.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.364
All right!

29:04.375 --> 29:05.865
All right.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.366
what are you
gonna do with us?

29:22.375 --> 29:24.366
I've told you
a dozen times,

29:24.375 --> 29:25.911
my father is dead.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.908
Yeah,
that's what I thought, too.

29:27.917 --> 29:30.374
He ran out on us
when I was a kid.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.911
Three years later, he died.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.407
I have
the death certificate.

29:33.917 --> 29:35.407
we got
an insurance payment.

29:35.417 --> 29:38.409
For God's sake,
you're making a mistake!

29:38.417 --> 29:40.408
Look, Susan...

29:40.417 --> 29:42.408
you don't mind if
I call you Susan,

29:42.417 --> 29:43.907
do you?

29:43.917 --> 29:45.407
Now, get this straight.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.908
Your father, Jimmy the Eraser,

29:47.917 --> 29:48.906
is not dead.

29:49.417 --> 29:52.409
Maybe youarewrong, Mom.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.954
Maybe it was a mistake
about Grandpa dying.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.950
Yeah, now you got
the idea, kid.

29:56.959 --> 29:58.415
You could be proud, too,

29:58.417 --> 29:59.953
'cause Jimmy the Eraser

29:59.959 --> 30:01.950
was one of the best
hit-men around.

30:01.959 --> 30:03.415
He sold insurance.

30:03.417 --> 30:05.408
I can remember
when I was a little girl

30:05.417 --> 30:07.408
him coming back
from business trips.

30:07.417 --> 30:09.954
Yeah, he sold insurance.

30:09.959 --> 30:11.950
Yeah, he soldlifeinsurance,

30:11.959 --> 30:13.950
and he always collected.

30:14.959 --> 30:16.950
You just don't believe me.

30:16.959 --> 30:18.950
Please.

30:18.959 --> 30:20.950
Please let us go.

30:20.959 --> 30:22.950
My father is dead.

30:23.959 --> 30:25.449
Soon.

32:14.041 --> 32:17.033
where are they, Sallie?

32:17.041 --> 32:18.030
My family.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.032
Don't get nervous, Jimmy.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.030
I'm shaking like a leaf.

32:21.041 --> 32:22.030
You better talk to me.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.032
They're inside.

32:24.041 --> 32:26.032
- Just Ralph?
- Yeah.

32:26.041 --> 32:28.578
we didn't want
anybody else to
know that, uh...

32:28.583 --> 32:31.040
You didn't nail me?
Our little secret?

32:31.041 --> 32:32.577
well, now you can
take it to your grave.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.072
what do you want, huh?

32:34.083 --> 32:35.072
Just tell me.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.075
Get Ralph out here, alone.

32:38.083 --> 32:40.074
Tip him, I waste you.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.573
Got it?

32:41.583 --> 32:42.572
Got it?!

32:42.583 --> 32:45.575
Good.

32:58.083 --> 33:00.074
Ralph!

33:00.083 --> 33:03.075
I see something funny.

33:03.083 --> 33:04.619
what is it?!

33:04.625 --> 33:06.081
Come on out here, will you?

33:08.083 --> 33:10.074
You got to see it.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.615
Oh, my God.

33:22.625 --> 33:25.116
Hello, Susan.

33:32.667 --> 33:35.124
welcome back, Jimmy.

33:35.125 --> 33:36.661
Dumb move.

33:36.667 --> 33:38.658
As soon as Sal
opened his mouth,

33:38.667 --> 33:40.123
I could hear him sweating.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.114
You let him

33:42.125 --> 33:44.116
fake you out, Sallie.

33:44.125 --> 33:46.116
I couldn't help it, Ralphie.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.661
Don't blame Sallie.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.658
He's just a gopher,

33:49.667 --> 33:51.658
and I ain't chopped
liver, Ralphie.

33:51.667 --> 33:55.159
Hey, I got respect
for you, Jimmy.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.158
I know you do, Ralphie.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.157
Then you know
I ain't gonna take any chances

34:00.166 --> 34:02.157
with your daughter and the kid.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.656
So let's negotiate.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.658
what do you say, Ralph?

34:05.667 --> 34:07.658
Let the family walk...

34:07.667 --> 34:09.658
or Sal here gets it.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.703
You want to ice
Sal, go ahead.

34:13.708 --> 34:16.155
I'll bury him right
next to your family.

34:16.166 --> 34:19.158
Say hello to
your grandpa, kid.

34:19.708 --> 34:20.697
Grandpa?

34:23.166 --> 34:24.702
So it's true.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.165
Sorry, honey.

34:26.166 --> 34:29.158
It's all up to you, Jimmy.

34:29.166 --> 34:30.155
Make up your mind.

34:30.166 --> 34:32.703
Now, Ralph,
this is between me and you.

34:32.708 --> 34:36.201
we never let family
get involved before.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.697
Things change.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.199
I got a position
now, Jimmy.

34:39.708 --> 34:41.699
I'm running
Papa Chuck's territory.

34:41.708 --> 34:42.697
Congratulations.

34:42.708 --> 34:43.697
You're a big man.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.199
That's right.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.699
So I'll do what I got to do
to keep it.

34:47.708 --> 34:48.697
You hear me?

34:48.708 --> 34:51.199
Get the gun, Sal.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.741
Now you're showing
some sense.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.206
You stay put, Jimmy.

35:06.208 --> 35:08.199
Hands out where
I can see 'em.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.744
Come on Sal, move it.

35:11.750 --> 35:12.739
I'm coming, I'm coming.

35:12.750 --> 35:14.240
Nervous, Ralphie?

35:14.250 --> 35:15.740
Just careful, Jimmy.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.741
Come on, come on,
let's get out of here.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.741
Go! Go!

36:09.291 --> 36:11.282
Oh!

36:14.834 --> 36:16.825
How do we get out of here?

36:16.834 --> 36:18.825
Just keep going,
keep going.

36:34.834 --> 36:36.324
Ralph!

36:47.333 --> 36:48.823
I got him.

37:04.875 --> 37:07.867
Let's go get Jimmy.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.366
It's no use; we're trapped.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.364
Nah, if they were tailing us,

37:20.375 --> 37:21.865
they would
have been here already,

37:21.875 --> 37:23.866
and MacGyver, you can't kill him
with an axe.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.365
Probably he's got them
all wrapped up.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.365
well, what are
we going to do?

37:27.375 --> 37:28.865
we're going to wait here.

37:28.875 --> 37:29.864
Come on.

37:48.375 --> 37:49.911
You sure they're in here?

37:50.375 --> 37:53.412
These buildings run
the whole damn block.

37:55.417 --> 37:57.908
Susan. Susan...

37:59.917 --> 38:03.409
I really didn't want you
to get mixed up in this.

38:03.417 --> 38:06.409
why did you
just run out on us?

38:06.417 --> 38:08.908
I did it
for you and your mother.

38:08.917 --> 38:11.909
I didn't want you dirtied
by what I was,

38:11.917 --> 38:13.953
so I walked out.

38:18.959 --> 38:20.415
Susan...

38:22.959 --> 38:24.950
It was better that way.

38:24.959 --> 38:27.416
Better for who?

38:27.417 --> 38:29.408
Me...

38:29.417 --> 38:30.953
or you?

39:20.001 --> 39:21.491
You think that's your friend?

39:21.500 --> 39:22.990
Shh!

39:25.001 --> 39:26.491
Shh.

39:52.000 --> 39:52.989
It's Ralph and Sal.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.536
You're getting out of here.

39:55.000 --> 39:55.989
How?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.991
Brian, I'm going
to have to count on you

39:58.000 --> 39:59.991
to get you and your mom
out of here.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.536
Okay, what do I do?

40:01.542 --> 40:02.531
All right, I'll tell you what.

40:02.542 --> 40:04.533
I'm going to make a lot of noise
out there...

40:04.542 --> 40:05.531
you know,
like cowboys and Indians.

40:05.542 --> 40:06.998
- Distract them.
- You can't.

40:07.000 --> 40:07.989
It's got to be done.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.991
Take this, and take this,

40:10.000 --> 40:14.039
and when you hear that noise,
you bust these windows.

40:14.041 --> 40:16.032
Then with these here bars,
you pry back the grates,

40:16.542 --> 40:18.032
and you get out,
and you run as far

40:18.041 --> 40:19.030
and as fast you can,

40:19.542 --> 40:20.531
You understand?

40:20.542 --> 40:22.533
what about you, Grandpa?

40:22.542 --> 40:24.032
No, you can't do it;
we'll find some other way.

40:24.041 --> 40:25.030
There is no other way.

40:25.041 --> 40:26.531
And no matter what,

40:26.542 --> 40:28.533
you see nothing,
you hear nothing.

40:28.542 --> 40:30.533
You just keep going.

40:30.542 --> 40:33.579
And don't look back.

40:33.583 --> 40:35.039
Dad, no!

40:35.041 --> 40:37.578
Please.

40:37.583 --> 40:40.040
"Dad."

40:40.041 --> 40:43.579
I guess that's the only thing
I ever wanted to hear.

40:49.583 --> 40:53.075
Very nice to have met you, son.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.116
Come on out, Jimmy.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.617
Take what you got coming
like a man.

41:41.625 --> 41:44.116
MacGyver's dead, Jimmy.

41:44.125 --> 41:48.619
It's just you and me now.

42:39.166 --> 42:40.155
Hey, Ralphie!

42:40.166 --> 42:42.703
Come on, come and get me!

42:42.709 --> 42:43.698
Or do you want Sallie to do

42:43.709 --> 42:46.701
your dirty work for you?

42:49.166 --> 42:52.158
Hey, Ralphie, I
ain't going nowhere.

42:52.166 --> 42:55.203
No place to go, Jimmy.

42:55.208 --> 42:57.199
where's your daughter
and the kid?

42:57.208 --> 42:58.197
where are they?

42:58.208 --> 43:00.199
Let's keep the family out of it.

43:00.208 --> 43:01.698
You want me? You got me.

43:01.709 --> 43:04.200
You know the rules, Jimmy.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.698
No loose ends.

43:05.709 --> 43:09.201
Come on Jimmy, be smart
and tell them to sing out, now.

43:09.208 --> 43:11.699
You want music, Sallie?

43:11.709 --> 43:12.744
Go rent a canary.

43:12.750 --> 43:16.197
we'll take you down
piece by piece.

43:18.208 --> 43:19.744
You asked for it.

43:19.750 --> 43:21.741
we'll take
the shoulder first.

43:23.208 --> 43:25.199
Run! Keep running!

43:48.750 --> 43:51.241
where you got
'em hid, Jimmy?

43:51.750 --> 43:54.241
Search me.

43:54.250 --> 43:56.787
I never have been
much of a family man,

43:56.792 --> 43:58.783
know what I mean?

44:01.250 --> 44:03.241
They're in here someplace.

44:03.250 --> 44:06.242
Your screaming
will flush 'em out.

44:06.250 --> 44:09.788
Got these special
for you, Jimmy.

44:09.792 --> 44:12.784
Oh, yeah? what's that?

44:15.291 --> 44:16.781
Hollow-tipped
wad-cutters.

44:16.792 --> 44:19.784
They're small going in,
but they make a hole

44:19.792 --> 44:22.283
the size of Detroit
coming out.

44:22.291 --> 44:23.280
Very painful.

44:25.792 --> 44:28.283
Something funny, Jimmy?

44:28.291 --> 44:30.782
Yeah... you two geniuses.

44:30.792 --> 44:33.829
They're out of here already.

44:33.834 --> 44:36.280
Doesn't make any difference.

44:36.291 --> 44:38.282
we'll just run 'em down.

44:38.291 --> 44:40.282
Think about that, hero.

44:40.291 --> 44:41.280
Give my regards

44:41.291 --> 44:43.282
to Papa Chuck.

45:12.333 --> 45:13.322
You look terrible.

45:13.875 --> 45:17.322
You're no day at the beach,
either.

45:17.333 --> 45:19.870
Yeah, but I feel like...

45:19.875 --> 45:23.322
oh, I'm sitting
on top of the world.

45:25.333 --> 45:26.322
Thank you.

45:26.875 --> 45:29.332
Anytime.

45:42.375 --> 45:43.364
Come on, Grandpa,

45:43.375 --> 45:45.366
I'm never gonna make it
to the major leagues.

45:45.375 --> 45:46.364
Are you kidding?

45:46.375 --> 45:48.866
You got baseballs growing
out of your family tree.

45:48.875 --> 45:50.365
Tell that to the coach.

45:50.375 --> 45:52.366
well, you're just
gonna have to show him.

45:52.375 --> 45:55.913
You stand up to the
plate, you plow the
ball into orbit...

45:55.917 --> 45:57.373
it all starts right here.

45:57.375 --> 46:00.367
And you got to know
that you can do it.

46:00.375 --> 46:01.911
we'll work on it together.

46:01.917 --> 46:03.908
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:03.917 --> 46:06.374
Now, why don't you run
upstairs, grab my coat,

46:06.375 --> 46:08.366
otherwise we're gonna
be late for the game.

46:08.375 --> 46:11.367
Okay, Grandpa.

46:11.375 --> 46:12.364
Oh...

46:12.375 --> 46:13.410
Brian!

46:13.417 --> 46:14.406
It's all right.

46:14.917 --> 46:15.906
No problem.

46:15.917 --> 46:17.407
Doctor said he didn't need

46:17.417 --> 46:18.907
those ribs anyway.

46:18.917 --> 46:21.909
Not many guys would take
a bullet for a friend.

46:21.917 --> 46:26.411
what do you say we don't make
a habit of that, friend?
