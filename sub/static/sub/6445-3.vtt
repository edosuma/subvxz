WEBVTT

00:15.432 --> 00:20.347
Along with a healthy cash prize,
Lucky Lucy wins the chance to compete-

00:20.521 --> 00:21.931
What are we doing here?

00:22.106 --> 00:23.937
Well, I don't know, exactly.

00:24.108 --> 00:26.690
I got this tip there's something weird
going on up here.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.566
I thought it might be a good story.

00:28.737 --> 00:33.106
By weird, you mean two people
at Makeout Point not making out?

00:34.118 --> 00:35.949
You're right. We're undercover.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.782
We should probably be
a little more convincing.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.416
-the new model year.
Among the newcomers...

00:41.583 --> 00:44.950
...to the market,
the Toyota Camry Hybrid...

00:45.129 --> 00:47.962
...boasts an MSRP
below $26,000...

00:48.841 --> 00:54.302
...40 mpgs for the urban commuter
and 38 mpgs on the open road.

00:54.471 --> 00:59.135
-Are you putting the move on me?
-No, no. Come on.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.097
Do you want me to?

01:03.605 --> 01:04.890
Okay, look.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.816
...on the summit of intimate territory
back when we were interns.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.603
-I thought it was, wasn't it?
-No, it deﬁnitely was.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.318
Okay, me too. Really.
I mean, really, deﬁnitely.

01:15.492 --> 01:20.907
And it's not like I wouldn't mind
exploring that territory again one day.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.660
But I just thought maybe this time...

01:23.834 --> 01:25.790
-...we could take it slower?
-l'm slow.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.623
Look, slow is great.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.669
You'll barely see me move.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.936
-Wanna go for a swim?
-But I didn't bring my bathing suit.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.150
Neither did I.

02:00.329 --> 02:03.196
-l'|l race you to the lake.
-Okay.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.999
What was that?
That came from the path. Come on.

02:15.177 --> 02:18.044
Yeah. We should deﬁnitely
go check out the dark woods.

02:18.222 --> 02:19.211
Let's go.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.891
Why would anyone wanna wander
around the woods?

02:25.062 --> 02:28.554
-They were probably headed for the lake.
-This is a really bad idea.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.723
You know,
maybe we should call someone.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.232
Hello?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.437
Is anyone there?

02:33.612 --> 02:36.399
No, I was thinking more like
authority ﬁgures...

02:36.573 --> 02:38.825
...who carry weapons, you know?

02:49.253 --> 02:50.743
Thanks.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.088
Looks like the naked trail ends here.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.556
Is that...?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.676
Oh, my God.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.628
-ls that the invitation for the ball?
-I just RSVP'd.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.459
I hope Lex gets a good turnout.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.671
Can't imagine anyone from Metropolis'
who's-who list not showing...

04:21.845 --> 04:24.427
...to help the families
affected by Dark Thursday.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.845
You know, I responded for two.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.144
Thanks, Mom,
but costumes really aren't my thing.

04:33.315 --> 04:36.022
Besides, it's not really the place
for a reunion, you know?

04:38.820 --> 04:41.197
How do you feel
about the two of them together?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.032
I don't know.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.235
It's like they're different people.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.163
We all have our own ways of moving on.

04:52.334 --> 04:57.874
Whether it's about growing up
or just surviving.

05:00.092 --> 05:03.880
Mom, I've lost Lana, Dad, Jor-El.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.885
You don't see me as a different person.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.344
Well, in a lot of ways I do, Clark.

05:09.893 --> 05:13.101
All those things have shaped the person
you are now.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.851
And the person you'll become.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.650
I already know what the device isn't,
Dr. Groll.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.194
Yourjob is to tell me what it is.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.578
I want a report.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.998
What's all this?

05:37.045 --> 05:41.379
My God, your complexion
is even more radiant than in the magazines.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.498
This is Monica.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.714
She's helping us pick out costumes
for the charity ball.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.049
She can help you
put something together.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.387
Well, thank you for coming,
but I think I can dress myself.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.894
Oh, come on, Lana. I thought you'd
have fun becoming anyone you wanted.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.431
Well, I can tell you what I'm not.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.066
The next Lex girl.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.447
Monica, will you excuse us?

06:09.703 --> 06:12.285
You saw this morning's paper.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.747
Look, Lana,
l was raised in front of the cameras.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.124
I know it can be hurtful.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.959
When I was 13, a reporter caught me
between classes at boarding school.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.250
He asked me how I felt
about my mother's death.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.932
A mike shoved in my face in front
of classmates I couldn't stand.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.139
That's how I found out she died.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.310
The press will tear us apart
if we let them.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.448
Well, they're right about
the revolving door of women you've had.

06:50.619 --> 06:51.984
Maybe.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.448
But I've never asked any
to move in with me.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.244
Lex, I know you.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.831
You desire what you can't have.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.162
So, what happens when you get it?

07:05.884 --> 07:09.172
I'd be lying ifl said I didn't struggle
against my nature every day...

07:09.346 --> 07:12.679
-...to let myself have this with you.
-l'm ﬁghting mine to believe you.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.847
Lana, I've given you time,
I've given you space.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.057
-You still don't know what you want.
-You do?

07:20.232 --> 07:22.518
I want us to stop pretending
we're only roommates.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.483
Lex, I just need to be sure.

07:28.657 --> 07:32.445
-I always trust people too much.
-No, you trusted Clark too much.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.995
You can come up with excuses
why this won't work.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.450
But you have to decide.

07:39.376 --> 07:42.994
You can either ﬁght with Clark's ghost
or you can be with me.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.923
I'm done paying for his mistakes.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.727
-Hey.
-Hey. How goes life living with Lois?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.888
Closer to coffee, further from sanity.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.149
But, you know, until
Metropolis University reopens, I guess—

08:06.319 --> 08:08.981
-What is it about a gift horse?
-Stay away from the mouth.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.863
Which is difﬁcult
because Lois uses hers so much.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.409
So, what's going on?

08:13.577 --> 08:18.571
Okay, so I found a body in the woods
up at Lone Pine last night.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.659
Girl and guy make
like the birds and bees.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.792
Girl gets her wings cut, guy buzzes off.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.453
-You think he killed her?
-I seriously doubt...

08:26.631 --> 08:29.919
...some freshly minted pimple-popper
is capable of doing that.

08:30.093 --> 08:35.258
I mean, the mo. wasn't exactly normal,
if you know what I mean.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.672
What do you mean?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.681
lmpaling people in trees
in under ﬁve minutes...

08:41.855 --> 08:44.187
...isn't humanly possible.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.891
Unless the guy was infected
with kryptonite.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.855
And that's our only lead
and he's still missing.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.439
What were you doing at Makeout Point?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.447
What's up, CK?

09:33.657 --> 09:35.989
-Hey.
-Hi.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.157
"Queen Industries."
Must've caught a strong headwind.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.743
Mrs. Kent's been waiting for this
for weeks. Thanks.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.160
You're welcome.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.299
Oh, crap. I'm sorry.

09:58.014 --> 10:01.006
With a face like that,
you could do a whole lot better...

10:01.184 --> 10:03.846
...than playing errand boy
to the rich and arrogant. Here.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.306
-Thank you very much. What is that?
-Your tip.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.688
It's a tip. Okay.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.814
Seriously, aim higher.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.398
Listen—

10:18.868 --> 10:20.074
Thought I heard the door.

10:20.245 --> 10:24.079
Yeah, your pledge ﬁnally sailed in
from Queen Industries.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.873
-Where's the man who came with it?
-The courier?

10:27.377 --> 10:30.540
Oh, I gave him his tip
and sent him on his merry little way.

10:35.927 --> 10:40.136
Handsome, chiseled features
with a smile that could light up a barn?

10:40.890 --> 10:44.223
Mrs. Kent, you have a crush
on the courier?

10:45.353 --> 10:47.810
You mean the billionaire CEO
who stopped by...

10:47.981 --> 10:50.472
...to talk about his ﬁnancial support
of my platform?

10:51.192 --> 10:53.854
No, Lois. I don't.
I've never even met him.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.771
And now, I probably never will.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.328
That was Oliver Queen.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.170
Sorry. They'd already organized
a search party.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.421
And the police dogs from Granville
will be here in another hour.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.956
Where did you ﬁnd the body?

11:16.134 --> 11:18.420
It was just up the road
about a quarter mile.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.675
Okay.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.968
Guess I'll meet you there.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.517
You're not supposed to be here.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.776
I'm
s
orry
7

11:36.863 --> 11:39.696
I'm with the search party. Clark Kent.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.113
Gloria. Park Services.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.697
They ﬁnd anything yet?

11:50.794 --> 11:53.126
No. Nothing.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.619
Have you?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.293
It's a big forest.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.966
Lots of green.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.303
You must feel isolated out here
working all alone.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.513
There's no one for miles.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.220
No.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.390
It's what I love about it.

12:21.116 --> 12:24.108
We haven't met before, have we?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.452
I think I'd remember.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.256
So you searched this whole area
all by yourself.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.584
Couple of times.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.340
I haven't found anything
that's not supposed to be here.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.593
One more search wouldn't hurt.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.686
I found him. Go get help.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.521
-C|ark, where are you?
-Over here!

13:03.241 --> 13:04.230
He's alive!

13:09.372 --> 13:10.873
Oh, my God.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.701
Clark, you're bleeding.

13:32.020 --> 13:36.184
We don't have much time.
His mom's in the cafeteria.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.724
Wow, this guy's pretty messed up.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.518
Not as bad as his girlfriend.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.408
Hey, what are these things on his lungs?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.615
Beats me.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.867
-Jimmy.
-What?

13:56.794 --> 13:59.752
Look, we have to get this in the paper.
We have to warn people.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.209
-We don't even know what it is yet.
-She's right.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.795
A picture of a weird x-ray
isn't page-one material.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.427
Maybe we'd have a better picture
if I was with you when you found him.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.597
Okay, that was my call.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.760
You're just so much more at home
on the streets of Metropolis.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.849
-I know the woods freak you out.
-No, no.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.229
What freaks me out...

14:18.399 --> 14:21.311
...is my girl traipsing through a forest
when that can happen.

14:21.986 --> 14:22.975
Your girl?

14:24.447 --> 14:25.436
I mean, aren't you?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.200
Guys.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.032
This really isn't the time.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.906
Yeah, you're right, CK.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.541
I gotta go take care of something,
so we'll talk later...

14:42.715 --> 14:44.967
-...when we're alone?
-Okay.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.884
Is he always that ﬁred up?

14:52.058 --> 14:55.266
You should see him
when he's on his 10th cup of house drip.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.648
-How are your hands?
-Healed.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.059
Which begs the question...

15:04.237 --> 15:07.274
...since not even Obi-Wan's lightsaber
can Ginsu your dermis...

15:07.448 --> 15:08.984
...how did a vine cut through it?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.774
I don't know. I didn't get weak,
so it's not kryptonite.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.912
Well, I sent a cutting of the vine
to my botany professor at Met U.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.324
If it's not meteor rock,
what else could it be?

15:19.836 --> 15:22.373
Lone Pine Ridge goes right up
against the Luthor Estate.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.084
There's a greenhouse
that runs near the property line.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.089
That'd be a good place to start.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.717
Okay, call me the advocate
of the devil, Clark...

15:29.887 --> 15:33.471
...but don't you think pointing the pitchfork
at Lex is a bit of a stretch?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.597
He had his hands
on the Kryptonian ship.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.349
He was possessed by Zod.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.976
He nearly destroyed this planet.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.762
-If the horns ﬁt—
-Okay, ﬁne.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.683
I'm just saying you might wanna check
your personals at the door.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.378
Seeds.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.555
You've always had an eye for beauty.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.774
Its Latin name, formositas falsus.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.532
Beauty that belies a dark nature.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.739
So even your plants
have hidden agendas.

16:41.501 --> 16:46.040
Well, I guess it all comes down
to survival of the ﬁttest, doesn't it?

16:48.424 --> 16:52.918
A strange vine has cropped up over the
ridge at Lone Pine. It's attacking people.

16:53.096 --> 16:58.056
And naturally, you came to my little shop
of horrors to foil my ingenious plot...

16:58.226 --> 17:01.764
...to repopulate the planet
with vegetation.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.933
Sorry, Clark, I'm all out of evil.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.477
Lana must be a calming inﬂuence on me.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.192
She's never gonna ﬁt in your world, Lex.

17:13.866 --> 17:18.075
Unlike you, I'm willing to do
whatever it takes so she does.

17:18.246 --> 17:22.114
You can keep fooling yourself that you've
changed, but the closer you get to Lana...

17:22.291 --> 17:24.998
...the closer she is to ﬁnding out
who you really are.

17:26.129 --> 17:30.293
The days of you showing up
unannounced in my home are over.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.923
You're not welcome here.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.928
You found your way in,
you can ﬁnd your way out.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.139
Hey.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.727
Hi.

17:55.324 --> 17:59.033
It was such a rush to evacuate the dorms,
I guess I took a few of your things.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.452
Thanks.

18:01.622 --> 18:07.208
Oh, wow, I was really missing this
half-chewed eraser.

18:08.629 --> 18:13.589
And your library book
which is two weeks overdue. Lana?

18:15.553 --> 18:20.673
I don't know why, but I felt like I needed
an excuse to come and talk with you.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.936
Excuse accepted. Let's go upstairs.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.863
Feels like a lifetime since I lived here.

18:38.034 --> 18:42.698
Yeah, well, a sprawling
17th-century mansion isn't a bad upgrade.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.952
Well, actually,
it's getting kind of crowded in there.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.117
-Water?
-Please.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.293
Lex seems to think that I'm dragging
Clark's ghost around with me.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.171
And he didn't sign up for a threesome.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.882
Chloe, I have this terrible feeling.

19:05.645 --> 19:10.639
I feel like if I do this with Lex,
I'm going to lose my identity.

19:12.068 --> 19:16.937
Well, Lana, if you don't trust him now,
that dynamic's not gonna change.

19:17.114 --> 19:21.198
It's just that I keep blaming
my trust issues on everyone else.

19:21.953 --> 19:26.367
And the truth is, the person
that I don't trust is myself.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.989
I keep--

19:29.877 --> 19:32.084
I haven't always made
the right decisions.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.917
And when I realize
that I have made the wrong ones...

19:35.091 --> 19:37.127
...l'm too far gone to get myself out.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.967
Lana, I don't know if Lex
is the right guy for you or not.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.474
He certainly wouldn't be my ﬁrst choice,
but he wouldn't even really be on my list.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.227
You can't just sit safely by the water...

19:50.398 --> 19:53.231
...and watch all the happy people
splashing around.

19:53.401 --> 19:57.861
I mean, eventually, you have to grow
some ﬁns and just dive in.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.941
Oh, my God.
You scared the blink out of me.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.523
I thought I was the only one
that felt safe out here.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.938
No. No, no, no, no.
Not safe. Compelled.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.230
By what?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.320
A girl.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.323
And a photo.
You know, my hope, her respect.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.330
Well, you have mine.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.876
Says the girl who made me drop a log.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.669
Look, is there any chance you've seen
this weird vine that's fond of people?

21:00.843 --> 21:04.051
Yeah, I think I can help you ﬁnd
what you're looking for.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.217
Well, I don't know what's--

21:07.850 --> 21:10.307
Well, I don't know about but—

21:11.520 --> 21:13.431
Well, you know,
I already got a girl, so--

21:15.107 --> 21:16.893
I don't wanna be your girl.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.646
Well, then what are you doing?

21:23.824 --> 21:27.533
I just wanna wrap myself around you.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.228
Miss, you cannot go in there.

21:56.399 --> 21:59.391
I'm sorry, Mr. Queen,
this woman does not have an appointment.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.359
It's okay. She's expected.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.904
I guess I really underestimated
the mental powers of yoga.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.573
Well, I ﬁnd the focus beneﬁts my work.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.003
And apparently, your premonitions.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.829
After your lamentable blunder,
it was either this...

22:22.008 --> 22:24.420
...or a good ﬁring from your boss, right?

22:25.302 --> 22:30.092
Although, I must say
I didn't picture the fruit basket.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.969
Yes, Mr. Queen.

22:32.143 --> 22:36.386
I surmise that you're very busy with all
your bendy stuff, so I'll be really short.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.270
Peanuts? I'm allergic.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.772
I'll try and remember that.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.563
Look, Martha Kent
is a sterling senator...

22:43.738 --> 22:47.026
...and I would be devastated if--

22:47.783 --> 22:49.489
Childhood bobbing trauma?

22:50.411 --> 22:51.446
Are you hungry?

22:52.455 --> 22:54.491
No. Okay.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.538
Look, I realize that I was very rude
the other day...

22:59.712 --> 23:02.124
...and I'm just trying to apologize.

23:05.468 --> 23:08.926
If you hold this against Martha Kent,
it will be you who is missing out...

23:09.096 --> 23:11.838
...on the opportunity of doing good work
with a great woman.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.309
Right.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.972
Well, I guess I was prematurely
accurate on my opinion of you.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.520
Miss Lane.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.613
If you want my full attention...

23:29.784 --> 23:31.740
...oome with me
to Lex Luthor's ball.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.073
While I'm sure downsizing me
for an entire evening...

23:35.247 --> 23:38.785
...would make great sport,
I think I'll pass.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.496
If Martha Kent's as amazing
as you say she is...

23:41.670 --> 23:43.501
...it's gonna take more
than groveling...

23:43.672 --> 23:46.664
...to convince me
that she's worthy of my support.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.678
I don't have a costume.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.678
You don't have a costume.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.233
Right.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.389
The telepathy.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.059
Here you go.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.651
Okay.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.161
Even in my size.

24:18.332 --> 24:21.995
Mr. Queen, have you been rummaging
through my drawers?

24:23.379 --> 24:26.086
Well, I have a good eye
for sizing people up.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.091
So you were right.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.382
The pods inside his stomach
are seeds.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.267
-He's going into surgery.
-Anything from your professor?

24:40.437 --> 24:43.679
He was unable to identify the species
but he could break down the DNA.

24:43.858 --> 24:47.817
It's foreign to the planet Earth,
which explains why it could cut you.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.194
-lt's alien? How did it get here?
-I don't know.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.355
But while it can't gestate in our soil...

24:52.533 --> 24:55.946
...the chemistry of the human body
creates a perfect potting mix.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.158
Find his mother.
I'm issuing a code red.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.756
Oh, my God.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.428
We need to stop it.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.889
Not "it," Clark.
"Her." The plant's gynoecious.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.099
It has a sex. Female.

25:25.274 --> 25:28.766
It needed a male to reproduce,
which is why the girlfriend was killed.

25:28.944 --> 25:29.933
Coming through.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.694
Park ranger at Lone Pine.
Hunter found her this morning.

25:32.865 --> 25:36.198
Excuse me. I think I can identify her.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.871
There's been a mistake.
That's not the park ranger.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.457
Selina Adams, 28,
went missing last week.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.292
Only female ranger in the county.

25:54.637 --> 25:55.626
Gloria.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.141
Your attention, please.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.974
An emergency has been reported
inside the building.

26:06.148 --> 26:11.108
All employees should immediately
proceed-- For further instructions.

26:11.278 --> 26:15.772
Wardens will be on hand to direct
employees in areas that require evacuation.

26:15.950 --> 26:19.067
All visitors, contractors
and nonemployees of the hospital...

26:19.245 --> 26:23.864
...must immediately proceed to the nearest
exit and leave the building at this time.

26:24.041 --> 26:27.499
All patients are urged to remain
in place to await further instruction...

26:27.670 --> 26:30.036
...or assistance by hospital....

26:33.509 --> 26:34.999
Gloria!

26:35.177 --> 26:37.589
I was hoping we'd meet again.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.930
-What are you?
-l'm just a girl that loves nature.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.846
You're not human.

26:45.187 --> 26:48.395
-You're not even from this planet.
-No.

26:49.149 --> 26:53.062
-But I think I'm gonna like it here.
-Wherever you're from, go back.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.649
-Now.
-I can't.

26:56.198 --> 26:59.031
My world is gone. It was paradise.

26:59.702 --> 27:02.193
It was lush and green and full of life.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.038
But towers of steel
replaced the forests...

27:06.208 --> 27:07.914
...upsetting the balance of nature.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.871
So I tried to correct it.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.785
At the cost of how many lives?

27:13.716 --> 27:16.207
They didn't understand me either.

27:16.385 --> 27:20.344
They branded me a criminal and
imprisoned me in a desolate wasteland...

27:20.514 --> 27:23.096
...where the suns never set
and nothing ever grows.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.927
The Phantom Zone.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.856
I knew I'd seen you before.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.483
The Kryptonian
that opened the gateway.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.071
-How do you know that?
-Because I was there.

27:40.409 --> 27:44.027
-The savages were attacking a girl.
-Raya.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.574
You touched the gateway
and it went white.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.414
Looks like I'm not the only one
that doesn't belong.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.756
You can learn to adapt like I did.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.882
What do you think I'm doing?

28:00.054 --> 28:05.799
There's a party nearby full of eligible
suitors waiting for me to spread my beauty.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.977
-Can you smell them?
-You have to stop.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.853
Says who?

28:16.320 --> 28:18.527
I can't change my nature...

28:18.697 --> 28:21.279
...and no one else
will ever make me again.

28:51.438 --> 28:55.477
Welcome to the ﬁrst annual beneﬁt ball
for the victims of Dark Thursday.

28:55.651 --> 28:59.314
On behalf of Lex Luthor, we thank
everybody for reaching into your pockets...

28:59.488 --> 29:03.276
...and supporting the families affected
by this disaster. You guys rock.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.549
I'm glad you came.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.756
So am I.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.387
I thought
I might have frightened you off.

30:52.226 --> 30:54.512
You'll have to come up
with better scare tactics.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.743
So is this part of your sizing me up?

31:17.918 --> 31:20.330
Well, Miss Lane, honestly,
that was a miscalculation.

31:20.504 --> 31:24.167
That would be my polite comment
on your choice of legwear for this evening.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.630
You have a quick tongue.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.962
I ﬁnd that very attractive.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.629
Well, keep it in your quiver,
jolly green bandit.

31:31.807 --> 31:35.470
So is your fortune the do-it-yourself
steal-from-the-rich kind...

31:35.644 --> 31:38.511
...or is it silver-plattered like our host's?

31:38.689 --> 31:40.850
It belonged to my parents...

31:41.650 --> 31:44.983
...and I inherited it when they died.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.649
Well, I wasn't gonna give it to you,
but the tights?

31:51.827 --> 31:55.490
-You're totally pulling it off.
-You should see him in a tutu.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.665
Lex Luthor.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.824
And with a girl
he doesn't have to inﬂate.

32:01.670 --> 32:04.002
Lana Lang, Oliver Queen.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.128
We went to boarding school together.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.166
Talk to any of the old gang lately?

32:11.388 --> 32:13.379
Enjoy the party.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.349
I always do.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.765
If that's a friend,
I'd hate to see an enemy.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.017
Senator Kent.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.402
Hi, I've been looking all over for you.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.814
I would like you to meet Oliver Queen.

32:33.035 --> 32:37.574
-Mr. Queen, it's nice to ﬁnally meet you.
-The pleasure's all mine.

32:37.748 --> 32:40.831
So Lois has been telling me
about your policy points.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.617
We should get together
and talk about how I can help you.

32:44.212 --> 32:47.670
-l'm looking forward to that. Thank you.
-Thank Lois.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.961
She can be very persuasive.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.471
Clark!

33:00.771 --> 33:02.557
Clark, I can't ﬁnd you on my own.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.687
You have to help me.
Where are you?

33:04.858 --> 33:07.645
-C|ark!
-Chloe.

33:08.445 --> 33:09.855
Chloe.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.567
Oh, my God, Clark.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.920
Come on, Clark, come back.

33:33.095 --> 33:36.007
This girl can't lose you twice
in one month.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.512
I will be in a second.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.174
How'd you kill it?

33:40.352 --> 33:43.014
Biology 101.
Electricity denatures enzymes.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.356
We have to help Jimmy.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.934
-Jimmy?
-He's over there.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.895
Go ﬁnd him.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.279
Gloria's headed to the mansion.

33:54.449 --> 33:55.438
Go.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.198
I'll get help for Jimmy.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.952
Go.

34:05.252 --> 34:08.244
Tarzan and park rangers
both love the wild.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.004
And swinging on vines.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.380
Ride's over.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.089
Who the hell are you?

34:17.264 --> 34:18.470
The gardener. Get out.

34:18.974 --> 34:22.137
Kryptonians. Always so hard and cold.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.846
You can't go home.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.147
I can't let you stay.
What are we gonna do?

34:26.481 --> 34:27.937
We'll have to let nature decide.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.783
You saved me from
the Phantom Zone, Clark.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.741
I'm sorry it has to be this way.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.193
There are pods inside him
that can be killed with electricity.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.228
-You're insane.
-Please listen to me.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.865
-You have to deﬁbrillate him or he will die.
-The guy is not in arrest.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.324
We will not deﬁb. Now, back off.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.930
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Back off.

35:51.900 --> 35:52.889
They're hot.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.565
Please don't let me kill him.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.582
Did you just paddle me?

36:23.265 --> 36:24.755
Yeah.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.567
I have enjoyed courting you
against your will this evening.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.986
Only because I let you.

36:44.244 --> 36:46.280
I'd like to kiss you now.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.663
You know...

36:51.209 --> 36:55.543
...the lady requires a show of skill
before awarding you with her favor.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.046
Which is actually
where I was going with the kiss.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.253
Let's make it interesting.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.638
Hit that can with your arrow...

37:11.730 --> 37:13.345
...and I'm yours.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.640
You're that easy, huh?

37:17.319 --> 37:18.980
It's that hard.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.067
I'm gonna go for it.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.178
All right.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.423
Here goes nothing.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.032
Better luck next time, Hood.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.052
This is deﬁnitely a night of ﬁrsts.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.888
How's that?

38:34.396 --> 38:39.516
Well, it's the ﬁrst time I've ever danced
in my extremely pretentious fountain.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.856
And it's the ﬁrst time I've ever felt...

38:44.197 --> 38:45.812
...this satisﬁed.

38:45.991 --> 38:49.483
I was half-expecting the word "happy"
to come out of your mouth.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.242
Happiness is just a feeling of euphoria.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.078
It's your brain chemistry
going into overdrive.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.117
That's why so many relationships fail...

38:59.295 --> 39:01.581
...when the honeymoon ends
and reality sets in.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.749
Have you always been
such a romantic?

39:07.303 --> 39:10.761
If you were any other woman,
I'd be saying everything you expect to hear.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.345
But you're not, okay?
You're not like anyone else.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.760
Well.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.302
Careful...

39:18.481 --> 39:23.350
...because I am dangerously
close to being satisﬁed.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.237
Then my evil plan is working.

39:31.036 --> 39:34.870
So, what made you change your mind
about gracing my arm tonight?

39:36.708 --> 39:38.414
Life.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.954
Wanting to live it.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.471
What are you doing?

42:00.518 --> 42:02.509
