00:15.680 --> 00:18.839
So, you see the thing is, Dad,
I could reapply next year,

00:18.960 --> 00:22.319
but if I defer and try again for Oxford,
I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...

00:22.440 --> 00:23.359
Mm...

00:23.480 --> 00:25.119
...which is a good university,
but not my dream.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.599
Do you think it matters in the long term,

00:26.720 --> 00:29.039
or is the subject and standard of degree
more important?

00:29.160 --> 00:30.519
So, I got married.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.598
- What?!
- To Suzy, we got married.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.679
You mean remarried.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.519
This time it's for keeps, though.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.359
- When did this happen?
- A few weeks ago.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.799
I was going to invite you, but I know
how you are around people.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.519
How am I?!

00:41.640 --> 00:44.119
Awkward. Weird.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.559
I don't live in a cave.
I live in suburban London.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.279
I spend my entire life around people.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.479
Much as I'd like to,
it's almost impossible to avoid them.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.999
See, this is what I mean.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.479
Well... Was it a big wedding?

00:54.600 --> 00:58.119
No. Couple of hundred close friends
and family.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.759
- And it was perfect.
- Mm.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.679
I can't believe you didn't invite me
to your wedding.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.919
So, what are you up to this summer?

01:07.040 --> 01:08.199
Oh, you're changing the subject?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.599
- Mm-hm.
- Fine.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.879
I dunno. I guess I'll be going on holiday.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.279
Oh, this should be good.
What have you got planned?

01:14.400 --> 01:17.559
Trans-Siberian Express?
Fossil-hunting in Dorset?

01:17.680 --> 01:19.319
Or maybe something even weirder.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.719
No, actually. Something normal. I'm going
somewhere normal, with my normal friends,

01:23.840 --> 01:25.079
to a place full of normal people.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.399
And you, of course.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.319
(SIGHS)

01:29.640 --> 01:31.359
# Wahhhhh

01:31.480 --> 01:34.119
# Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love

01:34.240 --> 01:37.719
# I really need it

01:37.840 --> 01:40.919
# Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love

01:41.040 --> 01:43.759
# Just set me free, yeah... #

01:43.880 --> 01:48.039
WILL: In case you were wondering,
that was me with my father.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.959
And this is where I live - not with him,
but with my mother.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.519
It's a long story. Well, not that long.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.679
He shagged the work experience girl
and then left us.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.399
So, just clichd, really.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.359
Plus, it only happened two years ago,
so I don't even get the luxury

02:00.480 --> 02:03.079
of blaming my various personality defects
on their divorce.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.519
Anyway, that's how I ended up here -
the very definition of suburbia.

02:07.640 --> 02:12.799
Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -
and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.279
Maybe that's unfair, as they do say
that you never know what goes on

02:16.400 --> 02:18.279
behind the net curtains of suburbia.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.799
Although, in my friend Jay Cartwright's
case, you can have a pretty good guess.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.919
(LUSTFUL GROANS)

02:27.960 --> 02:31.039
Are you ready to have some fun, big boy?

02:31.160 --> 02:32.719
Mmm.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.319
I'm feeling sexy!

02:34.440 --> 02:36.359
Take off mask, baby, let me see you.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.199
Nah.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.559
Do you promise this'll be properly filthy,
yeah?

02:41.680 --> 02:43.479
Oh, yes, like bomb explode from in penis.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.399
Sexy like...mmm...finger up bumhole.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.639
Christ, you make me so erect.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.159
Oh, yes, you also make me erect.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.199
Now, put in card details.
Oh, I'm so horny.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.079
Don't forget security number and bank.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.599
Mm! Come on, hurry up.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.039
All right, Jay's mum! Where's Jay?

03:04.160 --> 03:06.359
Oh, hello, Neil. He's at home,
updating his CV.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.479
(MOBILE RINGS)

03:07.600 --> 03:09.279
Ooh, excuse me.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.879
Hello?

03:12.880 --> 03:14.439
Ohh...

03:14.560 --> 03:15.879
It's a bit over, is that OK?

03:16.000 --> 03:16.999
Not really.

03:19.760 --> 03:23.559
- Excuse me! My prawns?
- Sorry, mate, I finish at six.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.519
Cheers for that.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.719
- You don't have to thank me every time.
- Oh, right. Cool.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.239
You're so fit.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.399
Simon, we need to talk.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.999
Oh, not talking!

03:51.120 --> 03:54.039
- Look, it's been great so far...
- It's been amazing.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.639
Literally the best year of my life.
My spots clearing up, not moving to Wales,

03:57.760 --> 03:58.679
and now you.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.599
And I'm definitely getting better
at kissing, aren't I?

04:00.720 --> 04:01.919
I think we should break up.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.599
What?

04:03.720 --> 04:05.879
We're both going away to uni soon,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.199
and it'll be too hard to keep it going
long-distance.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.159
- It won't be fair on either of us.
- I don't mind.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.759
You will mind, though. You will.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.159
I bloody won't!

04:13.280 --> 04:15.319
Plus, I'm going on holiday soon,
so there's that.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.199
Why? What are you planning to do
on holiday?

04:17.320 --> 04:19.439
Maybe you should just go home.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.519
I just need some space to think
at the moment.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.799
OK, fine. So, I'll see you later, yeah?

04:24.920 --> 04:26.279
Or, whenever?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.119
(WHISTLES)

04:35.440 --> 04:37.199
Mum, I'm back! When's tea?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.359
- In a minute.
- It had better be delicious!

04:50.840 --> 04:53.039
(SOBS)

05:02.440 --> 05:04.159
Ohhh...

05:04.280 --> 05:06.279
- Oooh!
- Oh, oh!

05:09.600 --> 05:12.439
Tell me you love me. Tell me you love me.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.679
Oh, yes, I like you. Oh, I like you.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.919
Get out! I'm just looking at holidays!
It's just holidays!

05:19.040 --> 05:21.919
Jay, can you come downstairs, please?
Your grandfather's died.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.959
Ooh, you've got a lady there, you bad boy!

05:27.080 --> 05:30.319
Has she got nice titties? Suck on
the lady's titties. Suck them, go on!

05:33.400 --> 05:35.199
WILL: It was our last ever day of school,

05:35.320 --> 05:38.039
something my new stepmum had
experienced only four years ago herself.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.439
So the head of Sixth was going to say
a few inspirational words.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.199
And if ever there was a man for the job,
it wasn't lunatic giant Mr Gilbert.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.519
I will forget each and every one of you
almost immediately.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.119
So, if you do find yourself at a loose end
next year,

05:51.240 --> 05:54.319
and think it might be nice to pop in
and see how we're getting on,

05:54.440 --> 05:56.799
don't. This isn't the Dead Poets Society

05:56.920 --> 06:00.319
and I'm not that bloke on BBC Two
who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.879
I especially don't want to hear about
how well you're settling down at uni

06:05.000 --> 06:07.319
or how much growing up you've done
in the past 12 months.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.999
At best, I am ambivalent
towards most of you,

06:11.120 --> 06:13.239
but some of you, I actively dislike,

06:13.360 --> 06:16.399
for no other reason
than your poor personal hygiene

06:16.520 --> 06:19.399
or your irritating personalities.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.919
I hope I've made myself clear
on this point.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.919
And in case any of you think
I'm joking...I'm not.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.559
I assure you that once my legal obligation

06:28.680 --> 06:30.639
to look after your best interests
is removed,

06:30.760 --> 06:34.319
I can be one truly nasty fucker.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.879
Good luck with the rest of your lives
and...try not to kill anyone.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.919
It reflects very badly on all of us here.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.199
Slightly more upbeat than I was expecting.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.359
WILL: They say your school days
are the best days of your life.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.839
But the only way that would be true for me

06:54.960 --> 06:57.759
would be if I went straight from school
to prison and stayed there until I died.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.679
How many times is that
she's caught you now?

06:59.800 --> 07:01.599
Four. But this was the worst.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.239
Mask, snorkel, ham.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.839
OK, one last one for luck.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.719
Ooooh!

07:07.840 --> 07:10.559
Good. Old school wedgie.
To be admired, in a way.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.599
Squashing the balls now.
Ooh! That does not tickle!

07:14.720 --> 07:16.039
Argh!

07:16.160 --> 07:18.559
Mark! What the fuck
do you think you're doing? Put him down.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.079
All right, calm down.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.959
Just saying goodbye to Bender Squad.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.879
- Have a nice life, dickheads.
- Oh, grow up! God!

07:25.000 --> 07:27.839
- Are you OK, Will?
- Fine! Slightly chafed arse crack,

07:27.960 --> 07:30.919
- but, no, basically fine, thanks.
- Hi, Simon.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.479
OK, well, bye, then.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.519
Fucking bitch.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.559
Is she?

07:39.680 --> 07:41.279
No.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.959
Oh, God... I just really miss her.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.799
(CRIES)

07:57.720 --> 08:01.639
It's all right, mate. I understand.
Anyone would miss those tits.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.839
- It's not that, Neil.
- Is it her lovely snatch?

08:03.960 --> 08:05.399
- No.
- I know it feels rough

08:05.520 --> 08:07.199
now, Si,
but you just need to give it some time.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.679
I'm just worried I'll never get over her.
(CRIES)

08:09.800 --> 08:11.639
- I can help you with that!
- Can you?

08:11.760 --> 08:14.519
Yeah! From now on, every time
you mention the Moanatronic 5000,

08:14.640 --> 08:17.039
- you get a slap in the balls.
- Do you mean Carli?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.119
Ow! For fuck's sake, Jay!

08:19.240 --> 08:21.119
- NEIL: You were warned.
- How's that helping?!

08:21.240 --> 08:23.119
Stopped you from crying like a baby,
for one.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.039
So my life is still ruined,
but now my balls ache too. Thanks, Jay(!)

08:26.160 --> 08:29.159
No, your life is just about to begin,
mate!

08:29.280 --> 08:32.399
Now you've been dumped, we can all go
on a mental holiday together.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.759
Two weeks of sun, sea, sex, sand, booze,

08:36.880 --> 08:39.799
sex, minge, fanny and tits.

08:39.919 --> 08:40.919
And booze.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.399
And sex!

08:43.400 --> 08:45.479
He's put it horrifically,
but he's probably right.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.959
A holiday would definitely
take your mind off her.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.839
JAY: Plus, it's the perfect time to go.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.359
NEIL: Yeah, they say the summer is
the perfect time for a summer holiday.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.399
WILL: Come on, Si, what do you say?
The lads on tour!

08:53.520 --> 08:56.239
- NEIL: And you.
- WILL: Yes, and me! One of the lads.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.479
Yeah, fuck it, go on, then.
Maybe it will help.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.239
Course it will! And, I promise you, Si,

09:00.360 --> 09:03.639
we'll go somewhere so full of fit birds,
it'll be like shooting clunge in a barrel.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.679
What a lovely image(!)

09:05.800 --> 09:09.159
WILL: So, that was it.
We were no longer schoolboys.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.479
And, to prove our independence,

09:10.600 --> 09:13.399
we were off on the holiday of a lifetime
without our parents...

09:13.520 --> 09:14.999
after we'd made them pay for it.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.039
I know this is the first time you've ever
been away from me, but don't go crazy.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.199
When have I ever gone crazy?!

09:19.320 --> 09:22.159
That time you drank all that shandy
at Debra's wedding. You went pretty wild!

09:22.280 --> 09:24.519
- I was seven years old!
- He was running round, his pants down,

09:24.640 --> 09:25.959
shouting, "I've got a white slug!"

09:26.080 --> 09:29.279
- Mum!
- Oh, hello, Kevin!

09:29.400 --> 09:31.879
Looks like just Jay
we're waiting for, then.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.159
Yes, it does "look like" that, doesn't it?
God! Sorry about her.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.559
Are you all right, Neil?
Your face is a bit weird.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.959
Fine! Just popped a bit of my sister's
fake tan on, get it started, you know.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.199
Just on your face?

09:41.320 --> 09:43.479
Well... It's on my hands, now, too.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.239
All right? Who's this, then, the vicar?

09:45.360 --> 09:48.359
Me? No, no, I'm Kevin. I'm Neil's father.
Nice to meet you.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.199
Where's Neil been hiding you, then?
The church? (LAUGHS)

09:51.320 --> 09:53.759
- Looks like a bloody vicar, don't he?
- No, no, I'm not a vicar.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.759
No, I know that. But you look like a vicar
and you talk like a vicar.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.519
A bloody gay vicar, or something! (LAUGHS)

09:59.640 --> 10:02.279
Well, I'm not a vicar and I'm not gay.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.039
No, I'm saying you lookgay.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.759
But you can't be, can you? Cos old
soppy bollocks here come out your pipe.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.159
Right, I see.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.399
Well, gotta get going.
Don't want you to miss that flight.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.159
Bye-bye, Pookie Petal. Love you, mwah!

10:18.240 --> 10:21.559
Oh, and Jay? If you're gonna spend
your grandad's money chasing skirt,

10:21.680 --> 10:25.439
two things. One, make sure she's not
a hound like the last one.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.559
And two, try to be a man when she dumps
you for someone with a bigger cock...

10:30.720 --> 10:34.279
...which is everyone! (LAUGHS)

10:34.400 --> 10:35.199
Dad!

10:35.320 --> 10:38.199
WILL: Dads are like arseholes.
Everyone's got one, yes,

10:38.320 --> 10:41.679
but also, they're arseholes. Which is why
they make excellent cab drivers.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.879
Takes me back, all this -
cheap flights at ungodly hours.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.399
Where is it you're headed to again?
Simon never tells me anything.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.839
- Malia, Mr Cooper, in Greece.
- Can't say I've heard of it.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.439
Of course you haven't,
it's a cool place to go.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.919
And it's got a Subways.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.999
Oh, right. In my day,
it was all about Spain.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.159
Me and my mates went to Magaluf
this one time.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.559
- Shagaluf, we called it!
- (NEIL LAUGHS)

10:58.680 --> 11:02.319
Should've called it Shagalot. And hard.
Anything that moved.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.079
We had a system.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.159
Always left a hat on the bedroom door
when one of us got lucky.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.639
Was usually me.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.759
Oh, Dad, please shut up!

11:08.880 --> 11:09.799
I don't know what it is,

11:09.920 --> 11:12.279
but you'll find girls just seem to let
themselves go a bit more abroad.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.199
It's like as soon as they smell
the sun cream, they get wet.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.279
- Your mother's the same, even now.
- Oh, God, just drop us here!

11:18.400 --> 11:20.359
WILL: I was learning a lot about holidays.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.879
And not just what they did
to Mrs Cooper's front bottom.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.079
I was also learning
that on a lads' holiday,

11:25.200 --> 11:27.479
it's compulsory to wear
"hilarious" matching T-shirts.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.039
Here y'are.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.119
Nice!

11:32.240 --> 11:35.639
Right, you owe me 12 quid each.
Except for you, Will, you owe me 20.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.119
What?! Why?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.919
Cos I had to bung the bloke
a few extra quid for him to make it.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.599
Right, so I've got to pay more money
for a T-shirt I didn't ask for

11:41.720 --> 11:43.919
and I'm not going to wear, cos it carries
a nickname I didn't know I had?

11:44.040 --> 11:45.159
- Yes.
- Great(!)

11:45.280 --> 11:46.719
(LAUGHING)

11:49.280 --> 11:52.199
# Come on, come on, come on, come on

11:52.320 --> 11:55.039
# Got my peeps standing with me
at the bar doing shots

11:55.160 --> 11:57.879
# Cos now we're so fucking plastered
we don't know when to stop

11:58.000 --> 12:00.839
# I got my peeps standing with me
and I'm having a blast

12:00.960 --> 12:03.719
# I'm feeling so fucking good right now
I want it to last

12:03.840 --> 12:06.319
# I'm at the bar and I see this chick
checking me out

12:06.440 --> 12:09.519
# From afar, yes, she wants my dick
There ain't a doubt

12:09.640 --> 12:12.439
# Now I'm in a lift, getting lips
How dumb is this girl?

12:12.560 --> 12:16.759
# But do I care? Do I fuck!
I'm on a roll! Yo! #

12:16.880 --> 12:18.639
Malia flight?

12:18.760 --> 12:19.759
Yep.

12:19.880 --> 12:20.999
Delay, seven hours.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.519
And please remove those T-shirts,
or we won't allow you to board the plane.

12:33.240 --> 12:37.439
WILL: Despite Neil offering - twice -
they didn't let him drive the plane.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.079
Finally, though, we'd made it on holiday,

12:40.200 --> 12:43.519
and Jay's thoughts on the beautiful isle
of Crete, birthplace of Zeus,

12:43.640 --> 12:45.039
were as insightful as ever.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.999
- I'm hot.
- It is well hot.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.519
- Might be too hot.
- Might be.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.039
- (CAR HORN BLARES)
- Oh!

12:57.400 --> 12:59.599
Carli! Carli!

12:59.720 --> 13:00.639
Carls!

13:02.520 --> 13:03.639
Oh.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.319
Sorry.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.479
(BUZZ OF CONVERSATION)

13:09.600 --> 13:10.559
Oi, Jay, Jay...

13:10.680 --> 13:12.079
Tidy minge, ten o'clock.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.479
Jay? Jay!

13:15.600 --> 13:17.719
Didn't you see them girls?

13:17.840 --> 13:18.959
Why don't you chirps 'em?

13:19.080 --> 13:21.719
- I can't handle that many at once, Neil.
- Really? What about that netball team?

13:21.840 --> 13:24.959
Yeah, that was all right,
cos that was a luxury caravan.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.479
But this coach is way too small
for my moves.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.959
Ah, course.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.559
Right, so, the plan is
get to the apartment, unpack,

13:30.680 --> 13:32.199
get some sleep,
then head out fresh tomorrow.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.879
First up, the Minoan Palace at Knossos.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.279
JAY: Have you come on a lads' holiday
by mistake?!

13:36.400 --> 13:39.279
We haven't come halfway round the world to
look at some boring fucking Greek ruins.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.199
Yeah, you can see that shit anywhere.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.919
We go there, drop the bags off,
then go straight out and get spasticated.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.119
Simples.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.839
But I've not slept for 37 hours.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.919
Shut up and try and get
some sleep on here, then.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.679
Fine, good idea.

13:51.800 --> 13:56.359
- (ENGINE STARTS)
- # We love you Burnley, we do

13:56.480 --> 13:58.559
# We love you Burnley, we do

13:58.680 --> 14:03.239
# We love you Burnley, we do
Oh, Burnley, we love you!

14:03.360 --> 14:05.719
- # Oh, Burn-a-ley
- # Oh, Burn-a-ley

14:05.840 --> 14:08.719
- # Is wonderful
- # Oh, Burn-a-ley is wonderful... #

14:10.000 --> 14:12.999
# Can you hear the Preston sing?
I can't hear a fucking thing... #

14:13.120 --> 14:16.399
WILL: When people ask me if I like
football, I say yes. I do like football.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.999
But not Burnley.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.999
Burnley can fuck off.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.519
# Come on, Burnley! #

14:21.640 --> 14:25.719
# Oh, Burn-a-ley is wonderful! #

14:34.280 --> 14:35.639
WILL: It was a tense moment.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.399
Someone was obviously staying here.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.439
Right, then, McKenzie party.
This is you.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.719
(BURNLEY FANS CHEERING)

14:42.840 --> 14:45.919
Good one, fellas! Don't worry,
it'll look nice when it's finished.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.599
- # Oh, Burn-a-ley!
- # Oh, Burn-a-ley! #

14:48.720 --> 14:50.759
# Is wonderful... #

14:53.480 --> 14:55.239
This don't look like the pictures.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.359
WILL: I still don't know how the dog died.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.599
I can only presume it threw itself
in the well, rather than stay here.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.679
You Willy?

15:02.800 --> 15:04.119
Yes.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.319
Your key. You have fun.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.839
But not too much fun.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.919
You shit on floor - 50 euro fine.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.079
Each time!

15:18.600 --> 15:20.159
All right, lads!

15:20.280 --> 15:22.439
- Are you stopping here?
- Yes. We are.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.319
Bad luck. I've just come back
from Afghanistan,

15:24.440 --> 15:26.399
and conditions there
are better than this shithole.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.679
I can't wait to get back to lying
in a dusty trench,

15:28.800 --> 15:31.239
being shot at by some raghead.
Are you married?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.359
- No.
- Don't get married.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.479
The wife booked this, but somehow,
it's my fucking fault.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.319
Anyway, pop down for a beer if you fancy.
I'll see youse later.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.719
Hey!

15:40.840 --> 15:41.999
You owe me 50 euros!

15:48.560 --> 15:50.279
WILL: As we entered our new home,
wondering

15:50.400 --> 15:51.879
if our human rights
had been breached,

15:52.000 --> 15:53.759
I couldn't help thinking
a shit on the floor

15:53.880 --> 15:56.159
might have
cheered the place up a bit.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.479
- JAY AND NEIL: Shotgun this room!
- Shotgun the sofa bed!

16:05.600 --> 16:06.799
Well, where am I gonna sleep then?!

16:06.920 --> 16:09.439
Not really my problem.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.399
What's that? Is that the bath?

16:11.520 --> 16:14.759
Course it's not the bath,
you fucking idiot. There's the bath!

16:14.880 --> 16:16.399
That's the...kids' toilet.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.599
- Is it?
- Yes!

16:17.720 --> 16:19.519
Why's it got a plughole and a tap, then?

16:19.640 --> 16:21.759
Cos it's for checking your kid's shit
before you flush it.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.479
- Urgh, that's grim!
- Yeah, I know.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.719
That's the Continentals, innit?
They're dirty.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.839
See? That looks nice!

16:27.960 --> 16:30.519
I'm not sleeping in a fucking bathtub
for two weeks, Simon!

16:30.640 --> 16:31.879
We'll have to share the sofa bed.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.079
(HIGH-PITCHED) Ooh, 'ello!

16:33.200 --> 16:36.919
Right, well, while you two decide
who gets first go on each other's cocks,

16:37.040 --> 16:38.359
I'm getting ready and getting out there.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.959
The gash isn't gonna fuck itself,
you know.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.999
Charming(!)

17:00.800 --> 17:02.759
(JAY SCREAMS)

17:14.680 --> 17:18.999
WILL: Finally, smelling like an industrial
accident at the Lynx factory,

17:19.119 --> 17:22.439
and looking like the world's
shittest boy band, we hit the town.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.479
- Ooh, heads down, boys.
- NEIL: Shit.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.359
What? Why? We haven't done anything!

17:29.480 --> 17:31.399
- Foreign police, innit?
- So?

17:31.520 --> 17:32.959
Don't you even know about foreign police?

17:33.080 --> 17:34.879
What, short-sleeved uniforms?
Chunkier truncheons?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.519
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Mate, they're all corrupt.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.959
Basically, if you misbehave
and don't have the money to bribe 'em,

17:41.080 --> 17:42.519
they take you up
to these shepherds' huts in the hills

17:42.640 --> 17:44.279
beat you up and bum ya.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.999
And if they don't kill ya,
you kill yourself,

17:46.120 --> 17:48.359
cos of the shame of getting a boner
whilst you was being bummed.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.239
Right, couple of things. Firstly,
the hills here are full of timeshares,

17:51.360 --> 17:52.559
not deserted shepherds' huts.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.519
Secondly, Crete's in the EU,
so I think the standard of policing

17:55.640 --> 17:57.599
probably goes beyond bumming
and forced suicide.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.719
Believe what you want. I'm keeping
a bribe up my arse just in case.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.959
You're gonna spend the whole holiday with
20 euros rolled up inside your arsehole?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.319
It's been up there since
the seatbelt signs went off, mate.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.119
All right, lads! Holiday, is it? I'm out
here on my own, having a mental time!

18:11.240 --> 18:12.919
Can I have a beer?

18:13.040 --> 18:14.999
- Oh, here you go, mate.
- No, you can't!

18:15.120 --> 18:17.039
All right, which is it?
You say yes, he says bloody no.

18:17.160 --> 18:20.159
- He's not your boss, is he? Eh?
- Sorry... Do we know you?

18:20.280 --> 18:22.119
Anyways, here's a good one for you, right.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.879
Get a torch and walk along the beach at
night and you get to watch people fucking.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.839
They're all drunk and you get to see
tits and cocks and that.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.359
If you're into cocks.
Which it looks like he is! Ha-ha!

18:31.480 --> 18:33.799
Well, it's been great talking to you,
but we've really got to get a move on.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.279
Can I come round yours for a shower?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.839
Um, no.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.279
No? Cool beans. See you later, lads!

18:39.400 --> 18:41.799
Richard, yeah? Richard!

18:41.920 --> 18:43.959
WILL: Well, Richard was clearly mental.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.759
But, as we were about to discover,
so was everything else here.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.439
# This place about to blow

18:56.240 --> 18:57.919
# Blow

18:58.040 --> 19:01.799
# This place about to blow

19:03.800 --> 19:05.719
# Blow

19:05.840 --> 19:07.879
# This place about to blow

19:28.680 --> 19:30.239
# This place about to blow... #

19:31.360 --> 19:35.039
WILL: While Simon was seeing Carli
everywhere,

19:35.160 --> 19:38.199
- Jay was seeing some very lucky ladies.
- She'd get it.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.879
NEIL: Most definitely!

19:40.000 --> 19:41.319
Oh, and that one. She'd get it!

19:41.440 --> 19:44.679
- And that one! And that one.
- And that one. She'd get it.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.039
Right in the bumholey.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.159
I can't believe I've already got a bird.
Gutted.

19:48.280 --> 19:52.679
So fucking what?! All birds know -
what goes on tour stays on tour.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.039
No, I couldn't do that to Nicole.
I think I love her.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.039
And I never loved anything before
apart from a car or a sandwich.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.559
If the build-up gets too much for you, you
can always borrow one of my johnnies,

19:59.680 --> 20:01.119
have a wank royale.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.799
- Oh, cheers, Jay!
- A what?!

20:02.920 --> 20:05.239
A wank royale. A wank with a johnny on.
It's a bit more expensive,

20:05.360 --> 20:06.839
so I tend to save it
for special occasions.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.719
Birthdays, Christmas,
the Champions League final...

20:08.840 --> 20:10.719
All right, lads!
Are you up for a good time?

20:10.840 --> 20:12.119
Yeah, we're always up for a good time.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.479
We're the Pussay Patrol.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.039
All right. Well, if you really are
the Pussay Patrol...

20:15.160 --> 20:16.839
- Which we are.
- You're obviously going to Marco's.

20:16.960 --> 20:21.079
It's the most buzzing bar out here. Always
packed with a chilled-out, sexy vibe.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.279
- Know what I mean?
- I don't really know what you mean.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.519
When you say "sexy vibe",
do you mean girls?

20:26.640 --> 20:27.639
Course! Loads of girls.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.959
I'll sort you out half-price drinks
and a free fishbowl.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.479
Cool, cool, cool.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.679
So, will you be in there,
with your sexiness,

20:34.800 --> 20:39.439
making the vibe all...sexy?
Being all sexy, and that, sexy?

20:39.560 --> 20:40.879
Say "sexy" more.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.159
Well, I will be if you're gonna be there,
you saucy bugger!

20:43.280 --> 20:45.359
Come on, then!

20:45.480 --> 20:48.999
Here you go, these four. I'll see you
in a bit. Mine's a Bacardi and Coke.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.199
Large one?

20:50.320 --> 20:52.479
Saucy! See you later.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.119
Fucking hell, you're well in there, mate!

20:55.240 --> 20:58.799
Yep! He shoots, he scores.
Right up the vag.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.119
Oh, my God, if she's outside,
imagine the birds inside!

21:10.480 --> 21:12.839
Ah. Interesting.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.719
Well, it must get going a bit later.
She did say it was amazing.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.879
And why would she lie?!

21:18.800 --> 21:22.439
All right, mate. Four pints, four
Jgermeisters and a fishbowl, please.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.599
Hello.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.679
- When it good here?
- Sorry?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.679
Er, when here party good?

21:30.800 --> 21:31.919
Normally about an hour or two?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.159
Oh. Well, as we've paid,
maybe we should hang on, then?

21:34.280 --> 21:35.639
But this year...never.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.679
Thanking you, very much.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.719
OK, let's go.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.439
Fuck off! My bird'll be down in a minute.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.519
You mean the woman who's clearly
on commission to trick people

21:43.640 --> 21:44.559
into this empty bar?

21:44.680 --> 21:46.279
No, I mean the little hottie outside
that I was flirting with.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.359
I'll take that as a yes, then.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.039
I'm going nowhere
till she's sucked me off!

21:49.160 --> 21:51.679
- So, you're going nowhere.
- WILL: Jay, we're on holiday!

21:51.800 --> 21:54.399
I'm meant to be out there, trying to
hit on girls that I think are beneath me,

21:54.520 --> 21:56.999
but who, for their part, won't give me
the time of day! So, let's go!

21:57.120 --> 22:00.759
Ooh! Hello, hello!
It's those little lovelies from the coach!

22:00.880 --> 22:02.959
- That one's not so little.
- I think they're looking at us.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.559
And not in a weird, terrified,
"leave us alone" way. Amazing!

22:05.680 --> 22:07.039
Jay, you're drunkest.
Go over and talk to them.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.999
Nah, not me, mate.
None of them are as fit as my one outside.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.719
Why go for hamburgers,
when you've got steak at home?

22:12.840 --> 22:14.479
If, like you, you have neither anywhere.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.999
It's up to you, then, Si.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.479
Shit, really?
I don't know if I'm over Carli.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.999
Ow! Fuck! Can you stop that?!

22:20.120 --> 22:23.119
Yes, I can. When you stop being
such a pussy about your ex.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.239
It's time to get back
on the horse now, Si.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.919
And those little ponies need feeding.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.719
Feed the pony.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.919
Yeah, OK, I'll introduce us,
but we've all got to go over together.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.399
- Great.
- You fucking sad cases.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.239
You don't just walk up to a girl in a club
and introduce yourself! That's creepy.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.999
Clubs are different rules, you dick.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.799
Look, you dance over near them, make
the eyes, then get 'em to dance with you.

22:44.920 --> 22:45.919
Really?!

22:46.040 --> 22:48.199
- Annoyingly, that does sound right.
- Thank you!

22:48.320 --> 22:50.279
And then, after a bit,
you stand up behind them,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.239
pretend to slap 'em
and fuck 'em up the arse.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.159
- That might be a bit much.
- Yeah, I dunno...

22:54.280 --> 22:55.999
Oh, fucking hell, I'll do it.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.319
- What about Nicole?
- It's only dancing, she likes my dancing.

22:58.440 --> 22:59.999
Stick with me, you'll be fine.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.599
Right, then, Si.
Looks like the holiday starts here.

23:03.720 --> 23:07.679
(# YOLANDA BE COOL:
We No Speak Americano)

23:37.880 --> 23:39.519
Am I doing it right? Am I in time?

23:39.640 --> 23:42.399
Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.
Copy Neil.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.479
Sorry. Do you mind
if we come and talk to you?

24:09.600 --> 24:12.479
Cos you look nice and, frankly, this is
just humiliating for everyone involved.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.599
Um...

24:14.720 --> 24:16.599
Sit down, Specs.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.359
Hello. I'm Lucy.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.839
Hi, I'm Diamond... Simon! I'm Simon.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.839
I'd better not get stuck with the fat one.

24:28.280 --> 24:31.519
So, when Alison initially suggested Malia,
we all thought, yeah, why not?

24:31.640 --> 24:33.759
It'll be ironic.
Then we had a reality check

24:33.880 --> 24:36.519
and we thought, do we honestly wanna spend
two weeks somewhere being ironic,

24:36.640 --> 24:39.439
and obviously the answer was no,
so then we looked at other places,

24:39.560 --> 24:44.519
but we realised, actually, we just want to
have a laugh and go clubbing and get drunk

24:44.640 --> 24:47.839
and be silly, and that this might
genuinely be a good place to come,

24:47.960 --> 24:49.079
so fuck it, here we are.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.519
Just so you know, I've met a really
fit bird and she'll be along any minute.

24:52.640 --> 24:56.199
OK. She won't mind you talking to me,
then, will she?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.799
WILL: If our dancing was bad -
and it was bad...

24:59.920 --> 25:02.479
then our small talk was even worse.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.599
Sorry, will you excuse us a moment?

25:18.160 --> 25:20.079
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?!

25:20.200 --> 25:22.039
What do you think I mean?!
Why aren't you talking to the girls?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.879
I get, like, words making sounds
in my head, but they don't come out.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.519
Well, that's easy to fix. Just say them!
Move your mouth and say them!

25:29.640 --> 25:31.639
Well, I can't pork any of them anyways,
cos of Nicole.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.279
But it would be nice to make a connection,

25:33.400 --> 25:35.759
like on them TV shows,
when people make a connection.

25:35.880 --> 25:36.759
Oh, this is hopeless.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.279
Well, I don't exactly see you
charming your way into their knickers.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.959
I just danced for the first time
in my life!

25:42.080 --> 25:43.119
It's hard to know what to follow up with.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.799
Maybe you could pretend to not have
the personality you've got.

25:45.920 --> 25:46.919
Like...pretend to be someone cool.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.839
Thanks, Simon. Thank you. Big help(!)

25:48.960 --> 25:50.399
Yeah. Actually,
it's probably best you don't even try.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.399
No, I am going to try.
If anything, I'm gonna try too hard.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.719
She is well out of your league.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.919
Like well, well, well out of your league.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.039
So? All girls I like are out of my league.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.839
What's the point of going for girls
in my league?

26:01.960 --> 26:03.719
Look at me! Imagine my league!

26:11.760 --> 26:12.879
Oh, God.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.959
Er, Jay, mate?
I think you missed the toilet.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.519
Are you saying I can't hold my drink?

26:16.640 --> 26:19.039
You are pissing your drink
all over the floor.

26:19.160 --> 26:23.599
So? It's still the toilet.
This whole room's the toilet.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.479
Neil? Can you chuck me a paper towel?

26:27.600 --> 26:30.519
Ah! Wipe the drip from my knob.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.359
Birds don't like it when it tastes pissy.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.159
OK, come on, guys. We've done
the hard bit. Let's not fuck this up.

26:40.280 --> 26:41.639
I just can't think of what to say!

26:41.760 --> 26:44.199
Just talk about something you love.
Something you're passionate about.

26:44.320 --> 26:48.639
Right. Oh, cool. Got it.
I know exactly what to say.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.679
It's pretty devastating,

26:49.800 --> 26:51.639
cos she's definitely
the most beautiful girl I've ever met.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.519
She's so fascinating.
She's really funny, you know?

26:54.640 --> 26:57.039
Oh, right. In what sort of way?

26:57.160 --> 26:59.079
Just like... You know when something's
funny and people get it?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.439
Yes.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.359
So, in that way.
And, also, in a comedy way.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.599
WILL: Neil was a man of few words,
but even for him, this was ridiculous.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.119
Not that I was faring
that much better myself.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.559
So, do this place hire you out as
some sort of avant-garde dance troupe

27:18.680 --> 27:19.919
to scare the customers off?

27:20.040 --> 27:22.919
No. I lost my mind and agreed to come here
on holiday. What's your excuse?

27:23.040 --> 27:24.319
Sort of similar.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.039
I came out here earlier this summer and
fell crazy in love with a gorgeous local,

27:27.160 --> 27:29.719
- so now I'm back.
- Hilarious. Course you did.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.119
What was he, a barman or a waiter?

27:31.240 --> 27:33.479
- Waiter.
- Brilliant. Was he called Stavros?

27:33.600 --> 27:35.439
- Nicos.
- Too good.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.679
I bet he's different to all the boys
back home!

27:36.800 --> 27:39.119
Yeah. He understands women, for one.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.839
I'm sure he does.
Must get enough practice.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.279
WILL: Not only had Jay not offered
to buy Jane a drink,

27:43.400 --> 27:45.519
he'd now stopped paying for his own.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.719
Meanwhile, Simon was on a roll.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.839
So then Carli said we needed some space.
And uni's coming up,

27:50.960 --> 27:53.599
- so maybe she's right.
- Sorry, who's right?

27:53.720 --> 27:54.719
- Carli?
- Who?

27:54.840 --> 27:55.759
Carli, my ex?

27:55.880 --> 27:59.359
You went out with a girl called Carli?
You should've said(!)

27:59.480 --> 28:02.239
What? I did!
That's all I've been talking about.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.279
Oh!

28:04.400 --> 28:06.319
Yes, I was joking!

28:06.440 --> 28:09.439
Sorry for going on about her. I usually
get a smack in the balls to stop me.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.599
What?!

28:10.720 --> 28:11.879
Um, nothing.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.439
WILL: Meanwhile,
Neil had a trump card to play.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.639
Do you want to dance?

28:28.320 --> 28:30.359
WILL: Meanwhile,
Alison didn't seem to be enjoying

28:30.480 --> 28:31.999
my hilarious Greek waiter impression.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.399
So, I presume he wooed you with the old,
"Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!

28:35.520 --> 28:39.479
"You hh'only girl for me!
There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!

28:39.600 --> 28:41.999
"Oh, wait, here comes the next plane
from Newcastle. I've gotta go, baby."

28:42.120 --> 28:44.719
Sorry, you do realise
I'm not playing along with the joke.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.519
I do genuinely have a Greek waiter
boyfriend called Nicos.

28:47.640 --> 28:48.879
No, of course you do.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.599
Brilliant. Nicos.
You've really nailed the clichs.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.039
- You are joking, aren't you?
- No.

29:01.160 --> 29:04.639
His grandmother has a moustache as well,
if that makes the stereotype even funnier.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.879
I'm sorry. I'm sure he's not like
every other waiter out here.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.679
It's fine. You don't know
what you're talking about.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.799
Your accent was pretty good, though.

29:11.920 --> 29:15.079
Oh, I've gotta go. Don't want to miss
my stereotypical Greek boyfriend.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.439
He might get angry and smash some plates.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.559
Or commit atrocities in Anatolia.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.079
You're not normal, are you?

29:27.120 --> 29:30.279
You all right, Lise?
Where's that bloke you were dancing with?

29:30.400 --> 29:36.079
# I've got nothing but love for you

29:36.200 --> 29:39.039
# I've got nothing but love for you... #

29:39.160 --> 29:41.759
Luce, we should go. Nicos finishes soon,
and I don't want to miss him.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.679
So, shall we all hang out again sometime?

29:44.800 --> 29:47.559
Yeah. You lot don't seem too bad.

29:47.680 --> 29:51.319
If I hear another bloke out here
refer to women as "gash", I'll scream.

29:51.440 --> 29:56.439
- Yeah. No, that is horrible. Really bad.
- It's awful when men do that. Disgusting.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.239
Do you fancy coming to the all-day
boat party, Friday?

29:59.360 --> 30:02.599
I know it's meant to be sold out, but
our rep reckons he can still get tickets.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.319
All-day boat party - what's that?

30:05.800 --> 30:06.999
Well, it's a party.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.199
OK.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.119
- All day.
- Yep.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.719
- On a boat.
- Oh, right.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.679
Well! Now that's been cleared up,
we should go.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.279
See you later, Will.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.359
Amazing.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.439
Do you realise, we just danced over,
chatted up some girls,

30:25.560 --> 30:27.119
they loved it and you didn't fuck it up!

30:27.240 --> 30:28.759
- Me?!
- Are we players?

30:28.880 --> 30:32.679
I'm starting to think that here, unlike
at home, we might actually be players.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.519
Maybe. I'm not really sure
what that means.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.999
However, cos I've not slept now
for two days, I'm going to bed.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.399
Yeah. My eyeballs feel like
they've got paper cuts.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.879
- Jay, are you coming?
- Fuck that!

30:42.000 --> 30:43.719
There's a fit bird up there
who's so wet for me,

30:43.840 --> 30:45.399
I can hear the waves breaking
in her fanny.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.519
I'm gonna down this, then take her down
the beach and fuck her brains out.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.959
Right, well, we've established
that isn't happening.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.879
Fine. Watch me.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.519
Mm. Classy(!)

30:57.640 --> 30:59.359
We'd better get Neil.

31:00.760 --> 31:04.879
- Neil...?
- Oh, God! We're off.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.479
Right. Won't be a minute,
I'll just finish up here.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.239
Christ, Neil, what about Nicole?

31:08.360 --> 31:09.879
Oh, she won't mind, we're not kissing.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.679
Nah. It's just fingers, in't it, lover?

31:12.800 --> 31:14.039
Right.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.879
Yeah. I'll catch you lot up. One second.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.719
He's definitely picked up the pace.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.759
WILL: While Neil picked up
his finger-banging speed,

31:21.880 --> 31:24.919
we picked up Jay - and he had
a chilling prediction to share with us.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.559
She's gonna suck my knob-knob dry.
You watch.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.759
I'd rather not watch,
if it's all the same to you.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.159
Shit, is that Carli?

31:31.280 --> 31:33.599
Look, Si, it's normal
that after a break-up,

31:33.720 --> 31:36.679
you'll think you see her everywhere,
but she's not here.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.159
Yeah. I suppose.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.079
- Could be her.
- What?

31:40.200 --> 31:41.919
Could be her.
She is out here at the moment.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.119
What?!

31:43.240 --> 31:45.239
Well, we weren't sure where
the best place to go was,

31:45.360 --> 31:47.719
and her and her mates are pretty cool,
so I asked them where they was going

31:47.840 --> 31:49.039
and when, and that's why I booked Malia.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.479
You fucking idiot!
I came away to try and get over her!

31:51.600 --> 31:53.399
- Did ya?
- You know I did!

31:53.520 --> 31:54.879
Oh, yeah, course.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.319
Oh, God, look at her.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.559
Do you think this is fate?
Her being here, me being here.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.159
No. I think Neil asked her
where she was going

32:04.280 --> 32:05.919
and then booked the same place,
like he just said.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.399
Let's go before she sees us!

32:07.520 --> 32:08.839
No, no. I've got to go and talk to her.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.519
If there's even the slightest chance
of us getting back together,

32:11.640 --> 32:12.639
I've got to take it.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.159
Carli!

32:14.280 --> 32:15.279
Carli?

32:15.400 --> 32:16.319
Simon?!

32:16.440 --> 32:17.799
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

32:17.920 --> 32:19.319
Stalking you abroad.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.759
No. The opposite, actually.
Just a mix-up by my friends.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.919
My stupid fucking idiot friends.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.719
Well, whatever. It's great to see you.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.919
Is it?!

32:27.040 --> 32:28.279
Yeah, it is. Course.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.399
Course.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.839
So, as we're here, why don't we hang out?
How about right now?

32:33.960 --> 32:37.359
Now? Oh, I can't now. But you'll be
at the boat party on Friday, right?

32:37.480 --> 32:40.879
The boat party? I was literally
just talking about the boat party.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.079
It's gonna be amazing. The best way
to round off our holiday.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.839
What? Why are you going? Don't go.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.759
I've got to go.
My flight leaves on Saturday.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.639
The boat's our last chance to party.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.759
Right. Well, I'll definitely be there,
then.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.639
For total, one million per cent.
Definitely.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.559
Cool. It'll be great to hang out again.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.959
- I've missed you.
- Hmm?

32:57.080 --> 32:58.559
Argh, Jesus!

32:58.680 --> 33:00.799
- Fuck it!
- Sorry, mate.

33:00.920 --> 33:05.799
- James! Are you all right, Simon?
- (WHIMPERS) Yeah, fine. Argh!

33:05.920 --> 33:07.559
I'll walk it off.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.759
Cool, yeah. Carls, come on,
we've gotta go.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.119
Oh, do you two know each other?

33:11.240 --> 33:12.279
Yeah, James is our rep.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.439
Rep, unofficial rep. I sort out club
nights. A bit of party organising, PR...

33:16.560 --> 33:19.879
Just make sure everyone's having
a good time, you know what I mean?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.439
- Are you sure you're all right, mate?
- All good...

33:22.560 --> 33:24.559
Cool. Carls, come on.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.959
Bye, Simon. See you on the boat.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.679
See you, mate. Mind that leg.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.119
I'll sort you out a free fishbowl.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.399
Oi, baby, you stood me up!

33:38.520 --> 33:40.519
Ah, didn't wait long enough, sweetheart.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.879
Come on, kiss me.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.159
I'm working, darling.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.959
I love your boobs.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.119
What?!

33:46.240 --> 33:47.999
What gives you the right to touch me,
you fucking prick?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.039
Wha...?

33:49.160 --> 33:51.039
Sorry, I think he might've had
a little too much of the old drink.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.959
I am sick of every dickhead
thinking he's got touching rights,

33:54.080 --> 33:57.519
just cos I smiled at him.
It's my fucking job, you cretin!

33:57.640 --> 33:58.679
Are you on the blob?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.519
Sexy. I like it.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.719
- No, Jay. Time for bed.
- Fuck that!

34:05.840 --> 34:08.119
You two can bum yourselves to death
on the sofa bed.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.199
I'm going to get another drink.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.119
Jay, don't be insane.
You're too drunk already.

34:12.239 --> 34:15.039
I'm on fucking holiday.
You can't be too drunk!

34:15.159 --> 34:17.799
- You coming, Neil?
- Nah, I like it in there.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.438
And not sleeping for two nights is pretty
much the same as not sleeping for one.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.559
Right, fine. Fucking knobheads.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.559
How was your chat?

34:25.679 --> 34:29.319
Amazing. Carli is here, Will. That's what
she was worried about, us being apart.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.039
That's why we split up.

34:31.159 --> 34:32.559
But we're not apart,
because we're both here.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.079
I just need to get on that boat.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.998
Actually, can one of youse help me?
I think she might be a two-man job.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.239
What happened to your leg?

34:44.360 --> 34:46.639
- Oh, I got a little bit run over.
- "A little bit run over"?!

34:50.000 --> 34:51.958
(WHOOPING)

34:52.080 --> 34:54.239
WILL: The next morning, I was woken up

34:54.360 --> 34:57.919
by what sounded like
Bigfoot having an asthma attack.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.359
(WHOOPING)

34:59.480 --> 35:01.479
Simon...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.079
Simon!

35:03.200 --> 35:05.559
Christ, it's like a sauna in here.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.319
Have you got any water?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.839
(WHOOPING CONTINUES)

35:08.960 --> 35:10.679
What the fuck is that noise?

35:10.800 --> 35:12.239
I think it's Neil.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.639
Oh, no, not the dinner lady
from last night!

35:14.760 --> 35:17.079
NEIL: I cannot understand a thing you say.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.239
WOMAN: Spunk all over me bastard tits.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.679
Well, it's her or Johnny Vegas.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.479
WOMAN: Fucking smack it!
Smack it, you little prick!

35:25.600 --> 35:27.759
- WOMAN: Is that all you've got?
- NEIL: Shall I bite it?

35:27.880 --> 35:28.799
Interesting question.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.639
This is beyond creepy.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.519
WOMAN: Twist it right fookin' off!

35:33.640 --> 35:35.159
OK, I'm getting out of here!

35:35.280 --> 35:37.039
WOMAN: Harder!

35:37.160 --> 35:39.679
How can I have spent 100 euros?

35:39.800 --> 35:42.559
Holy shit, I only budgeted 15 euros a day!

35:42.680 --> 35:44.439
Great, so I spunked all my money

35:44.560 --> 35:45.799
- in one night.
- All right!

35:45.920 --> 35:46.839
Oh, Jesus, Neil!

35:46.960 --> 35:50.159
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's on the way down. Have you seen Jay?

35:50.280 --> 35:51.479
Shit, no. Not since last night.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.839
No, I mean, have you seen him?
He's over there.

35:59.360 --> 36:02.239
(GROANS)

36:03.720 --> 36:06.079
WILL: So Jay had slept
face down in the dirt.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.479
But I'd woken up listening to Neil
getting sucked off.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.639
As far as I was concerned, he won.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.599
Urgh, ohhh!

36:16.360 --> 36:17.279
Face...!

36:17.400 --> 36:18.919
Yeah, you've got something on your face.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.559
It appears Jay's slept in an ants' nest.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.279
Argh! Pain!

36:25.400 --> 36:27.319
Tongue...

36:30.120 --> 36:34.599
It's all right, boys. Kitty don't bite.
Not now she's been fed.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.679
Hey, lover?

36:41.440 --> 36:44.039
What the fuck was that?!

36:44.160 --> 36:47.279
WILL: I'll tell you what does bite,
though. Ants.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.119
...86, 87, 88.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.439
88 fucking bites.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.519
Ooh, sorry. I asked for two poached eggs?

36:54.640 --> 36:56.039
Is poached, look.

36:56.160 --> 36:59.719
No, this is fried. And "an egg", singular.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.399
Yes, poached. I promise with all my heart.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.679
So, you're promising me, with all
your heart, that this is two poached eggs?

37:06.800 --> 37:09.399
Yes. Burger?

37:09.520 --> 37:11.079
Oh, that's mine.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.279
Oi, I'm starving!
Where's my bacon sandwich?

37:14.400 --> 37:16.959
I thought you'd have eaten enough pig
last night...

37:17.080 --> 37:18.999
- Mate, what were you thinking?!
- I dunno.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.839
She was saying all this dirty stuff
and she looked a bit like Will's mum.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.839
- So I thought, why not?
- She did not look like my mum, Neil.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.039
- She did a bit.
- No, she did not.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.919
Bet she did when she had his cock
in her mouth.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.039
- Brilliant(!)
- Don't you feel bad about Nicole?

37:28.160 --> 37:30.639
- Who?
- The girlfriend you just cheated on?

37:30.760 --> 37:32.919
Oh, no, no, cos only the tip went in.

37:33.040 --> 37:36.119
Any more than the tip is cheating, and I
would never do that, cos I've got ethics.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.199
- Right... Well, see you lot later.
- Where are you going?

37:39.320 --> 37:41.319
I'm going to find those girls.
They should be at the hotel.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.239
Lucy said her rep could still get
boat party tickets.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.279
Oh, wow. That's an interesting story(!)

37:45.400 --> 37:49.079
Well, it is, actually, because guess
who's going to be there - Carli.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.199
Ow!

37:51.520 --> 37:53.759
Look, she invited me to the party.
She said she missed me.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.319
There's got to be a chance she's...

37:55.440 --> 37:56.639
On all fours, sucking that bloke off?

37:56.760 --> 37:59.199
No, she wants us to get back together.
What bloke?

37:59.320 --> 38:01.319
Look, you're meant to be here
to forget about Carli.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.599
Argh!

38:02.720 --> 38:04.919
- Not me, Neil!
- I'll help you find them, Si.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.759
They were fun. It'll be good
to see them again. Alison was nice.

38:07.880 --> 38:11.759
Fine, fuck it. I'll help.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.039
Probably spot the lard arse
I got stuck with from outer space.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.879
- Neil?
- Can't,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.359
had a nightmare.
I left my trunks in England.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.599
Just wear your Calvins, mate.
They're practically the same.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.279
- Can I, Will?
- Um, yeah, I suppose.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.359
- And can I bring a ball?
- Yes, Neil. Yes, you can.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.039
WILL: Unsurprisingly, the girls' hotel
was nicer than our hotel.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.399
There are North Korean prison camps
which are nicer than our hotel.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.799
But, like a North Korean prison camp, it
was overcrowded, so we had nowhere to sit.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.239
- What about there?
- They've got towels on them, Neil.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.399
- So?
- That means people have bagsied them.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.199
- We can't take those.
- Fuck that!

38:44.320 --> 38:47.239
- No, Jay, we can't!
- Watch me!

38:47.360 --> 38:48.599
It's probably just a load of Krauts

38:48.720 --> 38:50.479
that got down early in the morning
to reserve 'em.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.199
That towel's got Finding Nemo on it.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.479
What, so Nazis can't like Disney too?

38:55.640 --> 38:58.839
- Jay!
- Besides, I really need a lie down.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.119
My head's more fucked
than Neil's dad's arsehole.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.479
Jay, please!

39:02.600 --> 39:04.239
WILL: Jay and Neil were off to,

39:04.360 --> 39:06.679
as they put it,
"check out the chicas".

39:06.800 --> 39:08.399
But I had a serious problem.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.679
In the absence of my mother, or a teacher,

39:10.800 --> 39:12.439
I needed help with my sunblock.

39:12.560 --> 39:13.759
Simon, will you do my back?

39:13.880 --> 39:15.599
- No.
- No?!

39:15.720 --> 39:18.559
- I don't want to touch you.
- Unbelievable.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.039
Fine, I'll do it myself.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.519
Look all right,
I'll do it with one finger.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.239
Thank you.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.959
You've got too much here.
And here. I'll scrape it off.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.759
OK, but don't try and be funny and draw
a cock on my back or something.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.159
No, course not.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.959
Right, all done.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.159
See, that wasn't so bad, was it?

39:45.280 --> 39:47.479
No, that was fine.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.719
WILL: I was really enjoying my book,

39:49.840 --> 39:53.319
blissfully unaware of the crudely drawn
phallus burning itself onto my skin.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.399
Meanwhile, Jay was having trouble
with his emergency funds.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.399
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's just that 20 euros.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.719
Ay-oh, Jay, here we go,
we've been spotted.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.079
Seen 'em.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.239
Look cool.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.919
(LAUGHS) Manchester.

40:15.200 --> 40:15.959
Manchester!

40:16.080 --> 40:18.199
- Who's this little twat?
- You from Manchester?

40:18.320 --> 40:19.279
You like Manchester?

40:19.400 --> 40:21.479
- Yeah, yeah. Near Manchester.
- No, you aren't.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.559
Shut up, Neil,
the birds are loving it.

40:24.640 --> 40:27.559
- Goal!
- (LAUGHS) Goal!

40:27.680 --> 40:30.079
Goal to Manchester! Yeah!

40:30.200 --> 40:31.439
No. Manchester, down.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.759
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

40:33.880 --> 40:35.759
Yeah, hilarious.
Now, get out the way.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.879
Whoa!

40:39.000 --> 40:41.479
(LAUGHTER)

40:45.000 --> 40:46.959
Right. You're fucking dead,
you little shit!

40:48.000 --> 40:51.519
Mate, just leave it,
the chicas are looking, just laugh it off.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.239
(FORCED LAUGHING)

41:11.400 --> 41:13.759
No, I'm fine for drinks, thanks.

41:13.880 --> 41:14.959
(CLEARS THROAT)

41:15.080 --> 41:17.239
Oh! Alison. Hello!

41:17.360 --> 41:20.559
Hello. You know you've got
a spunking cock on your back?

41:20.680 --> 41:22.119
What?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.799
Oh, no. Thanks, Simon,

41:23.920 --> 41:26.119
very funny, very mature. So I've been
lying here with a cock on my back, have I?

41:26.240 --> 41:27.759
Not for the first time.

41:27.880 --> 41:31.279
I'll burn a muff on my tit if it makes
you feel less self-conscious.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.799
It would, actually.
We'd make quite the pair.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.799
You've got a really good spot here.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.519
Yes, Jay, um...sort of, um...

41:36.640 --> 41:38.399
Did he use some of his boyish charm?

41:38.520 --> 41:39.879
In a way, yes.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.919
I think I might start drinking again.
Anyone fancy joining me?

41:43.040 --> 41:44.319
Um, yes, I will!

41:44.440 --> 41:45.559
Oh.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.119
Lucky me(!)

41:50.160 --> 41:52.039
Oh, I'm knackered.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.239
- Fishbowl hangover?
- No. Nicos was over last night.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.079
Does not stop talking.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.759
No, we were having sex.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.599
Right.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.599
Sorry, does it make you uncomfortable
when I mention sex?

42:03.720 --> 42:07.159
No! No, it's good,
it's great that you're so...

42:07.280 --> 42:08.639
sexually active.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.399
Yeah, I suppose it is.

42:11.520 --> 42:15.719
- What's the best sex you've had, Will?
- Well, um...hard to say, really.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.039
Come on, you can tell me.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.119
Oh! I don't like to sex and tell.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.959
Don't be boring, just tell me.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.959
Look, I'm going to level with you,

42:24.080 --> 42:26.879
I have never...put my penis in a lady.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.039
That's all right, you're a virgin,
that's cool.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.639
It's definitely not cool.
If anything, it's famously uncool.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.719
Well, it's cute, then.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.239
Oh, God, that's even worse.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.919
- You're funny, Will.
- Well, that's something.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.879
Can I get a girl into bed for sex
just by making her laugh?

42:39.000 --> 42:40.079
Course you can.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.919
Wow! Great.

42:42.040 --> 42:43.919
If she's a clinical moron.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.559
Lucy, it's so amazing to see you.

42:47.680 --> 42:50.039
What a welcome.
Nice to see you too.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.119
Yeah. Good. Now, can you
still get boat party tickets?

42:52.240 --> 42:54.839
I'd have thought so,
I'd just have to go and find the rep.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.119
So are you coming along, then?

42:56.240 --> 42:57.799
Yeah, course. It'll be amazing.

42:57.920 --> 42:58.839
Great.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.799
Cos Carli's here. In Malia.

43:00.920 --> 43:01.999
And she's going to be
on the boat tomorrow.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.199
If I can just get five minutes
alone with her,

43:04.320 --> 43:06.039
I know we'll fix things up, it's fate.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.919
So, can you go and get those tickets?

43:09.040 --> 43:11.279
You really know how
to make a girl feel special, don't you?

43:11.400 --> 43:13.079
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.439
Carli is going to love it.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.559
Can you hurry up?

43:17.840 --> 43:20.279
WILL: Simon's plan was coming together.

43:20.400 --> 43:23.999
Meanwhile, Jane was about to experience
the full force of Jay's boyish charm.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.519
Can you move? You're blocking the sun.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.879
Charming!

43:27.000 --> 43:28.679
What's happened to your face, Jay?

43:29.800 --> 43:30.919
It's a food allergy.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.759
I could do with one of those,
maybe an iced-bun allergy.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.319
Yeah. You could.

43:35.440 --> 43:38.399
Meanwhile, Neil had
a surprise in store for Lisa.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.239
Forgot my trunks.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.519
Fancy a swim?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.119
Oh, leave it out, you little prick.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.399
Right, that's it!
I'm going to fucking kill ya,

43:56.520 --> 43:58.119
- I'm going to fucking kill ya!
- Oi!

43:58.240 --> 43:59.639
Those are our sunbeds.
And where's our towels?

43:59.760 --> 44:01.319
Oh, good.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.199
Well, there weren't any towels
when we arrived

44:03.320 --> 44:04.439
and we've been here for the last hour.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.799
I didn't ask to read your fucking diary,
love. I said, "Where's our towels?"

44:06.920 --> 44:08.559
Now, there's no need to be abusive.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.159
If you look around,
there are signs everywhere

44:10.280 --> 44:11.399
saying you can't reserve sunbeds.

44:11.520 --> 44:12.879
So you moved our towels?

44:13.000 --> 44:15.919
The point I'm making is,
whatever the fate of the towels,

44:16.040 --> 44:17.319
these cannot be your beds.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.119
What have you done
with my fucking towels?!

44:19.240 --> 44:21.559
Sir, I get you nice other beds, please,
take up your stuff.

44:21.680 --> 44:23.199
Me?! What?

44:23.320 --> 44:24.279
Why should we move?

44:24.400 --> 44:25.399
Because he's made a scene?

44:25.520 --> 44:27.839
Because his family are too lazy
to walk 20 feet to the pool?

44:27.960 --> 44:28.959
Seriously, mate, I am warning you.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.479
Why have a rule
if you aren't going to enforce it?

44:30.600 --> 44:32.479
The signs are redundant.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.599
(WHIMPERING)

44:33.720 --> 44:36.439
My towel! (CRIES)

44:36.560 --> 44:37.839
Disabled. Course she is.

44:37.960 --> 44:38.879
Here you go.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.599
- Happy now?
- Well, obviously not.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.519
(SCREECHES)

44:43.760 --> 44:45.119
And that isn't helping.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.959
You lot have got five seconds
to get off my sunbeds.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.439
Right, come on, Will,
we'll just find somewhere else.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.879
But I still don't see
why we should move.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.839
Yes, his daughter
has a serious condition,

44:51.960 --> 44:53.559
but it's not like the whole family

44:53.680 --> 44:55.359
are therefore entitled
to pool-side seats for life.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.719
Plus, strictly speaking,
she doesn't even need another chair.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.759
Are you guests at this hotel?

45:03.880 --> 45:06.519
Ah! No! I no swim!

45:06.640 --> 45:09.439
Please, mister, I no swim, I beg you.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.199
Not pool!

45:11.320 --> 45:12.559
Argh!

45:12.680 --> 45:13.599
All right. All right.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.959
It's just a joke! We're... We're mates!

45:17.400 --> 45:18.919
(GASPING AND LAUGHTER)

45:19.040 --> 45:21.199
So little, so little!

45:21.320 --> 45:22.319
Ah!

45:37.160 --> 45:39.119
Great.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.639
And with a rough grab
from a BO-ridden security guard,

45:43.760 --> 45:46.879
Simon's perfect plan came crashing down.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.799
- Thanks a lot, Jay.
- Me?! What have I done?

45:50.920 --> 45:52.239
Oh, I don't know... Oh, yeah!

45:52.360 --> 45:53.879
Fucked everything up for me,
like you always do.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.279
I had to teach him a lesson, Si,
he was mugging me off.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.079
He was nine years old and couldn't swim!

45:58.200 --> 46:00.839
- Now my life is ruined. Thanks.
- Is this about the tickets?

46:00.960 --> 46:02.919
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!

46:03.040 --> 46:04.599
So, you don't get to go
to the boat party, so what?!

46:04.720 --> 46:06.399
So I don't get back together
with the woman I love!

46:06.520 --> 46:08.359
Look, it's not my fault
Carli thinks you're a prick.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.719
You want to watch me more closely, mate,

46:09.840 --> 46:11.119
- you might actually learn something.
- Oh, yeah?

46:11.240 --> 46:12.399
And what would I learn?

46:12.520 --> 46:13.479
How to bullshit about having sex?

46:13.600 --> 46:14.839
How to sleep in an ants' nest?

46:14.960 --> 46:17.879
- How to be scared shitless of my dad?!
- Oh, come on, Si, calm down.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.159
Maybe you'd learn not to be such
a massive tool over that miserable cunt.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.999
Don't call Carli a cunt!

46:34.440 --> 46:36.639
(PANTING)

46:41.520 --> 46:43.119
- You had enough yet?!
- Have you had enough yet?

46:43.240 --> 46:44.759
- I asked first!
- Ah...

46:44.880 --> 46:46.159
- Uh!
- We should do something.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.639
Yeah, do you want to go
and get a Subway?

46:47.760 --> 46:50.279
No. I meant about the fight,
we should break it up.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.999
Yeah.

46:52.120 --> 46:53.479
All right, come on, you two.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.799
No!

46:54.920 --> 46:56.279
Uh!

46:56.400 --> 46:58.879
I'm sick of his bollocks,
I'm going to fucking do him.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.119
Oh, you're hard, Si,
I didn't see you do me just now.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.919
- Come back here, then, you prick.
- Let's go for a walk!

47:03.040 --> 47:04.399
- Don't cry, Si.
- I'm not crying!

47:04.520 --> 47:06.519
- You're crying!
- Don't look like it, you're crying!

47:06.640 --> 47:08.719
- Come here, then.
- See you later, then, Will.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.959
Honestly, I'm done with that arsehole.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.599
I mean, why do I even
hang round with him?

47:19.720 --> 47:22.519
Well, yeah, obviously
we all wonder that at times.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.479
Look, it's been a tough couple of days,
the Carli thing is weird,

47:25.600 --> 47:26.679
but just cos you were
in a fight with Jay,

47:26.800 --> 47:27.959
- you don't have to leave.
- I'm not leaving.

47:28.080 --> 47:30.479
But you are aware
you're packing your suitcase.

47:34.880 --> 47:37.439
- I've never liked him.
- You've been mates since primary school.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.959
He's a little crybaby poof.

47:39.080 --> 47:41.439
And his hair,
everyone took the piss out of that.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.199
But not me, I didn't.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.359
Fucking wish I had now.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.799
- You did a bit.
- Well, no, course, a bit.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.479
But...not enough.

47:48.600 --> 47:49.839
He's a total twat!

47:49.960 --> 47:52.799
Oh, that's harsh, mate.
He can be a knob, but he's not a twat.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.279
- I'm going to sell my clothes.
- Oh, you're having a breakdown.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.999
She means so much to me, Will,
I don't care about anything else.

47:58.120 --> 47:59.039
If I can get enough money together,

47:59.160 --> 48:00.519
I can buy a ticket
for the boat party off someone,

48:00.640 --> 48:03.559
somehow, whatever it costs.
Money is all I need.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.239
I agree with you on money,
but who's going to buy your clothes?

48:05.360 --> 48:06.999
No of fence, but you dress appallingly.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.879
Are you going to help
or just constantly undermine me?

48:09.000 --> 48:12.119
- Bit of both, I'd imagine.
- Fine.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.639
Do you think Alison likes me?

48:13.760 --> 48:16.119
13 years he's been dragging me down.

48:16.240 --> 48:17.599
Well...fuck him.

48:17.720 --> 48:18.879
- What's that?
- Boat party tickets,

48:19.000 --> 48:19.999
I bought four the other night

48:20.120 --> 48:22.239
before I passed out.
Cost a fortune.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.719
I thought I'd surprise him.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.159
Well, here's his fucking surprise.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.039
- Oh, no, Jay, don't.
- No, fuck him!

48:27.160 --> 48:29.439
And fuck that dick Will too.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.199
What shall we do now, then?

48:39.280 --> 48:41.159
Now we have the best holiday ever...

48:41.280 --> 48:43.759
- and do what we came here to do!
- Get better at swimming!

48:43.880 --> 48:45.239
No.

48:45.360 --> 48:47.839
Go on Pussay Patrol!

48:47.960 --> 48:49.279
Unfortunately for him,

48:49.400 --> 48:52.839
Simon wasn't the only person in Malia
trying to sell shit no-one wanted.

48:52.960 --> 48:53.959
- Looky, looky. Hello?
- Hello!

48:54.080 --> 48:55.799
- Looky.
- Nice lady, good price.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.159
Clothes? Looky, looky.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.519
Top clothes for sale.
You want clothes? Good price.

48:59.640 --> 49:02.879
I think you'd have more luck
selling the big glasses.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.279
Isn't that Carli's friend?

49:04.400 --> 49:05.919
He's a rep,
I don't think they're really friends.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.159
All right, mate?

49:07.280 --> 49:08.639
What's this,
the world's shittest boot fair?

49:08.760 --> 49:11.079
Ha! No, just selling my clothes
for some money.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.119
I need money, desperately.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.239
All right! Well, as luck would have it,

49:14.360 --> 49:15.879
I've got a mate
who's had his apartment broken into.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.879
Fuckers nicked all his clothes.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.719
I reckon he'll be interested,
I'll call him.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.399
That'd be amazing, thanks so much.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.719
No problem, mate.
All part of the service, yeah?

49:23.840 --> 49:25.119
- See?
- All right, mate?

49:25.240 --> 49:27.199
Yeah, yeah. Got some clothes.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.679
Yeah. Um, got some girls' T-shirts.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.559
- These are girls', right?
- No.

49:31.680 --> 49:33.079
Hoodies like your mum would buy you.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.639
The sort of jeans Jeremy Clarkson wears.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.359
Oh, yeah, yeah!
It's all shit, yeah. Hold on.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.879
He says he'll give you
100 euros for the lot.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.679
Amazing! Totally! Cool!

49:41.800 --> 49:45.759
Coolie! Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. Thanks so much, man.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.959
Including what you're wearing now.

49:47.080 --> 49:49.999
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, that's the deal.

49:50.120 --> 49:52.879
Obviously he's not going
to take his clothes off.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.519
Oh, nice one.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.159
Oh!

49:56.280 --> 49:58.559
He's going to need your pants too.

49:58.680 --> 49:59.959
What, these?

50:00.080 --> 50:01.159
Fuckin' thieves stole everything.

50:01.280 --> 50:04.279
Gimme your pants, I'll be back
before you know it with your 100 euros.

Sorry, this has gone too far.
Simon, do not take your pants off.

Stop always telling me what to do, Will,
I'm an adult!

Here you are.

50:18.920 --> 50:20.759
- You'll be right back, yeah?
- Course I will.

50:20.880 --> 50:22.479
I'll see you very soon.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.839
Thanks, James.
Thanks so much, man!

50:33.360 --> 50:35.199
Yeah. Cheers, Abdul, good luck, mate.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.439
James isn't coming back, is he?

50:41.560 --> 50:42.519
Don't think so.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.639
Brilliant.

50:43.760 --> 50:47.199
So we made Simon some makeshift pants
and headed home to get changed.

In just 24 hours, Malia had pretty much
broken me and Simon,

51:31.480 --> 51:33.119
so in a way I had to admire
Jay and Neil

51:33.240 --> 51:35.159
as they rolled up the sleeves
on their offensive T-shirts

51:35.280 --> 51:37.239

You wouldn't find those other
two muppets in a place like this.

on these if he's lucky.

So what happens now?
It's probably a bit far

56:13.840 --> 56:15.839

No, Jay, it was you that was crying,

to pay for your drinks,

to be a baby about it,

56:50.360 --> 56:51.919

I now can't afford one.

We're regulars, obviously.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.879
Surprised to see you here again.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.479
Well, it's the only place we've been
where the blokes weren't total animals.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.559
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hello, by the way.

- Are you man enough, Jay-bo?
- Course.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.519
Thought you would be.

58:10.640 --> 58:13.199
Obviously we now rated as
so sexually non-threatening

58:13.320 --> 58:14.679
that these girls were happy
to drink with us.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.559
But to be fair,
I'd take that every time.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.839
So I've been thinking, about us...

58:20.960 --> 58:23.079
- What, the four of you?
- No, me and you.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.119
Well, there is no "us",

58:24.240 --> 58:26.599
so that must have been a weird
thought process, but go on.

58:26.720 --> 58:29.319
- I'm not sure Nicos is right for you.
- Interesting.

58:29.440 --> 58:32.159
Why wouldn't my sexy, charming,
caring boyfriend,

58:32.280 --> 58:33.959
who is also a sensational lover,

58:34.080 --> 58:36.119
- be right for me?
- You'd say sensational, would you?

58:36.240 --> 58:37.959
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

No, no. I can't have another one.

I'm sorry, didn't realise
you were a lightweight.

- What?
- Lightweight. Light-weight.

That is why I know you don't have
to worry about getting laid.

59:28.760 --> 59:30.359
Um, did I say I was worried?

59:30.480 --> 59:32.039
No, but it's obvious that you are,

59:32.160 --> 59:33.799
and you think
that somehow I'm the answer.

59:33.920 --> 59:35.599
Well, I am not, and you will be fine.

59:35.720 --> 59:38.199
I think you might be, though.

59:38.320 --> 59:39.599
Nonsense.

59:39.720 --> 59:42.479
You know, in fact, I am so confident
I will make a pact with you.

If you still haven't had sex
by this time next year,

59:45.320 --> 59:46.399
I'll have sex with you.

59:46.520 --> 59:48.799
As long as I'm not with Nicos,
of course.

59:48.920 --> 59:50.079
Of course.

Um...

See? Funny.

Yes, ha-ha-ha. Hmm.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.599
He is literally incredible.

Come on, Lise,
we're getting out of here.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.999
Let's go for a swim. Come on, you.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.359

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.359
Oh. I can't cos I haven't brought
my swimming costume.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.079
Oh, no! I haven't brought mine either.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.519
Really? What are you going to do?

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.559
Well, I'm going to go in naked. Are you?

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.199
Oh, right. Yeah, me too.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.359
Totally naked.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.199
Are they really going skinny dipping?

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.239
- If I know Jane, probably, yeah.
- Really?

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.119
- Fucking hell, really?!
- Yes.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.879
And...

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.079
...what about you?

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.759
Well, I'm meeting Nicos in half an hour.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.199
Course.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.919
So I reckon I've got time
for a quick dip.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.319
Alison was hopelessly out of my league.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.239
And yet, and yet...

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.719
No, I had no fucking chance.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.759
(GIGGLES)

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.519
Come on. What are you doing?

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.799
Get it off.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.159
No, yeah. Good. I will.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.719
Go on, then.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.359
All in good time.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.559
I'll look away, if you like.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.399
Um, yeah, that would be nice, thank you.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.359
OK, so, I'm looking away now.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.519
And so for only the second time today,

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.759
Simon was tricked into getting naked.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.759
Further along the beach,
for the first time ever, Jay was close

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.799
to seeing some naked women
not on a computer screen.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.919
Come on, Jay, don't be shy.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.799
I'll take it all off if you will.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.479
Um, all right, just...give me a minute.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.999
Are you scared that you won't be able
to control yourself?

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.359
MAN: She's a big girl. She is a big girl.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.239
Can't take it any more,
just give us a snog.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.319
Um...all right.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.999
But...let's go somewhere secret.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.399
Secret?

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.719
Just give us a snog here.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.159
Nah.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.839
Let's go somewhere
people can't see us.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.879
- OK?
- Fucking whale on the beach.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.799
Actually...forget it.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.479
I've already seen your cock,
and it wasn't pretty.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.999
All I'm saying is that, logically,

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.919
we might not have to wait
a year to have sex.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.359
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.039
I mean, once you remove Nicos from the
equation and think, as I say, logically,

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.839
it really makes no sense
to wait that long.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.759
Do you find that your logic
talks a lot of girls into bed?

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.239
Well, no.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.279
I was just curious to know

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.039
whether this kind of relentless, pedantic
chat is a big hit with the other chicks.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.719
- Well, obviously, it isn't.
- Thought not.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.719
What are you waiting for?

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.559
Um...I don't know.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.239
OK.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.039
(SIGHS) Take your clothes off.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.239
That's it till next year, I'm afraid!

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.319
I've lost my glasses.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.199
I've lost my glasses!

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.519
God, it's freezing in here.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.159
Don't be such a wuss.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.639
Ah!

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.119
That's right,
let's get someone's hair wet, shall we?

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.719
It always looks wet anyway, gel-boy.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.599
Right, how's this for a wet look, then?

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.639
(GASPS)

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.519

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.559
Oh, shit, sorry.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.639
Carli!

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.479
Carli, over here!

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.839
Carli, over here! Carls!

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.879
Carls.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.919
Come on, Will, it feels amazing!

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.559
Just getting my glasses!

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.559
You're not wussing out on me, are you?

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.479
Nope! As soon as I'm not blind,

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.079
I'll be right over with you
and the other naked ladies.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.879
Well, hurry up or I'm getting out!

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.519
- Jesus Christ, come on! Where are they?

(SQUEALING)

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.039
- What the...fuck are you doing?
- I'm really sorry,

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.439
I tripped. I've lost my glasses.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.839
You've got a big problem now, mister,
a big fucking problem.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.159
Oh, God. I'm so sorry,

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.999
I didn't know
you were down there, doing that.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.119
- (SPEAKS GREEK)
- Help!

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.359
I'm really sorry, mate. Help me!

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.439
(SPEAKS GREEK)

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.759
Nicos?

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.519
Alison?

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.759
What are you doing?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.959
WOMAN: How does she know
your fucking name, Nicos?

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.639
Donna, I just need you to be a little
bit quiet for five minutes, please...

01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.719
Who the fuck is that?!

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.359
Come and sit down with me,
I want to talk to you.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.959
We're supposed to be meeting up
in 15 minutes,

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.959
- you utter, utter scumbag!
- Glasses?

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.279
- Glasses?
- It's OK, it's OK.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.799
Glasses? Ooh!

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.199
There they are.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.679
Alison, I love you, I love you,
you are the only girl for me,

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.439
there no other girl in my life.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.079
Now, where have we heard that before?

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.679
Oh, just shut up, Will!

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.559
Baby, you know this weirdo?

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.679
I am not your fucking baby!

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.959
Alison, wait!

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.799
Simon.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.399
Are you swimming naked?

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.639
Hell, yeah.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.639
- That's not like you.
- Well, I'm on holidays,

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.479
so who knows, maybe it's a new me?

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.959
Oh, right.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.759
I like the old you.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.399
Hmm.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.759
OK, well, I'm off to bed.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.799
Can I come?

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.239
To bed?

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.039
- No, sure. I'm all wet anyway, so...
- Look,

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.319
I'm knackered, I've had a shitty night,
I just want to be alone.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.559
But I'll see you at the boat party.
We can catch up properly there, OK?

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.759
Yeah, course.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.079
- See you at the boat party.
- Great.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.159
See ya!

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.719
- I miss you too.
- Sorry?

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.079
You said it the other night?

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.999
Oh, yeah.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.119
Lucy! Lucy!

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.799
Alison, wait! I'll come with you!

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.239
- I want to be on my own!
- Um...

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.519
You're not expecting me
to hit him or anything,

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.199
- are you?
- No!

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.279
- Good.
- I don't expect

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.079
anything from anyone
but disappointment.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.679
You'll love me, then.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.159
And I will never have sex
with anyone again for as long as I live,

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.359
and certainly not with you.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.679
So just fuck off!

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.519
All of you, just fuck off!

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.439
Does this affect our deal?

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.119
Fuck your deal!

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.399
- Ahhhh!
- (MUTTERS IN GREEK)

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.239
Lucy.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.199
Oh! Are you getting out?

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.399
- Yes.
- That was Carli, did you see her?

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.719
Yeah.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.039
It was dark, but I saw her.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.359
Isn't she beautiful?

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.399
Yes, she's very beautiful.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.279
I'm going now.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.039
Oh. OK!

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.519
- All right?
- I've been better.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.839
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.359
About how shit the holiday is?

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:40.319
Partly that. Partly I'm thinking
about putting stones in my pockets

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:41.559
and chucking myself in the pool.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.038
Oh, I wouldn't swim in that, it's rank.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.078
Right.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.439
Also, if you put stones in your pockets,

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.118
you'll sink, so...better to not
have the stones, really.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.959
I'll bear that in mind, Neil.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.959
I stopped believing in God when
I realised it was just "dog" backwards.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.439
What?

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.198
Well, when you think about it -
G-O-D, D-O-G.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.399
It's like an anagram,
but a backwards one, innit?

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.679
Right.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.319
And then, after that,
I just stopped worrying about stuff.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:11.479
You only get one go round, I reckon.
When you're dead, you're dead.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.959
So you can spend your time thinking
about how things haven't gone perfect

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.799
or you can just get on with it,
have a laugh and that.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.479
That's what I do, I'm pretty happy.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:21.439
You are, aren't you?

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.639
Yeah!

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.238
Thanks, Neil. Thanks for that.

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:28.439
Just remember, it's D-O-G backwards.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.839
No, not that.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.999
No of fence, but that's moronic.
No, thanks for coming to cheer me up.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.399
I didn't come to cheer you up,

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.319
I come to say I did a shit
in the children's toilet

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.599
and I can't get rid of it.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.038
Oh, God!

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:41.639
Cos I thought I'd try something
different, you know? As a treat.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.839
- Oh...
- Oh!

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.198
Oh!

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:47.839
Neil, what the fuck has gone into that?

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.679
Have you been eating tear gas?

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.198
No, it's just a bit beery.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:53.118
And that meatiness
is probably the kebabs.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.199
OK, that's it. Neil, you were right.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.279
It may not be paradise,

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.159
but we can at least try and enjoy
this place for exactly what it is.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.399
A shithole?

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.199
Yes, but it's our shithole,
so let's get out there

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.879
and get royally fucked up
on Jay's dead grandad's money.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.479
It's what he would have wanted.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.239
If we get fined 50 euros, Neil,
you're paying it.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.439
- But it's not on the floor.
- Some of it is on the floor.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.079
Well, yeah, some of it.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.359
When he's at uni, you mean.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.919
- Yeah, but I'll be at uni too.
- Will ya?

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.799
- What, this year?
- In a few weeks.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.879
Oh, what? Just cos Will's going?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.839
- No. Cos I want to.
- Well...what about me?

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.159
What?

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.879
Well, what am I going to do?

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.199
Um...I don't know.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.319
Look, I thought you knew
I was going to uni.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.239
Yeah, course. No, but...

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.279
it's just that I was going to use
my grandad's money

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.239
to set us up in business,
selling car stereos

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.759
to Premiership footballers.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.679
Neil was going
to work in the depot, but...

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.879
me, you and Rio Ferdinand are on sales,
like, having a laugh and that.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.119
Oh, right.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.279
Yeah, I'm going to do sociology.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.279
Fuck.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.959
I'm sorry I ripped your tickets up now.
Could have had a bit of a send-off.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.239
- What tickets?
- Boat party ones.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.599
I bought them when I was pissed the
other night. I thought I'd surprise you.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.599
- Oh, well.
- You what... You tore them up?!

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.279
- Yeah.
- What, after we had the fight?

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.639
Yeah, I...I was angry
cos you had a go, and that.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.759
Yeah, sure.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.839
Makes sense.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.639
You fucking arsehole!

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.919
Yeah? You want me
to fucking mash you up again,

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:30.959
- do ya?
- Yeah!

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.239
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.959
Oh, you two...can't I even have a piss
out of the end of my cock in peace?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.079
You two go on,

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.479
I'm just going to have
a little recovery snooze.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.319
Come on, mate,
you can have my bed tonight,

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.919
this one's a bit bitey.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.679
Did I tell you I touched a boob tonight?

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.879
Like... Like a real boob.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.319
A girl's one.
I didn't get to lick it, though.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.959
This has been the best night of my life.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.039
It was the day of the boat party,

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.159
and it looked like literally
everyone in Malia had a ticket.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.759
Well, everyone except me and Simon,

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.359
whose mood was now bluer than his balls.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.399
If I could, I'd give you my ticket, Si.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.359
You can, just give me your ticket.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.599
Yeah, but I really want to go,
so you see, actually, I can't.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.719
- Take Jay's ticket.
- No, I think he needs it.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.959
What, cos of Jane?

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.959
No, in case the captain dies
and they need me to drive the boat.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.679
(GROANING)

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.079
Eased up on the vomiting,
mainly retching now.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.959
For the record, they don't clean
that toilet floor very often,

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.999
lots of pubes on hands, knees...
and my face

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.239
when I had a little lie-down.
I cannot believe we've been eating here.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.279
Wow, they look hot!

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.839
- Bit young for you, ain't they, Neil?
- Behave.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.239
Lucy. Lucy!

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.759
Alison! Aliso...
Oh. I give up.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.519
All right, boys? Who killed Will?

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.719
(GROANS)

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.839
- What's up with Lucy?
- I don't know.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:24.879
If you ask her rather than
talking about your ex the whole time,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.839
- you might find out.
- Oh, God, really?

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.839
Fine.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.519
- You coming to the boat party, then?
- You try and stop me.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.159
We just saw two hot fellas
dressed as firemen getting on board.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.319
Might need a hand with their hoses.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.919
Might have to set fire to my knickers.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.119
- I'll come with you, if you like.
- No, thank you.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.439
Come on, Lisa.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.319
You look as bad on the outside
as I feel on the inside.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.799
Oh, don't worry,
I feel like shit on the inside too.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.279
Although...

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.119
I don't have a pube on my cheek.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.599
Oh, God.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:59.639
Anyway, seeing you in such a mess
has at least cheered me up a bit.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.679
Glad to be of service.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.639
You know I have a penis
sunburnt on my back too.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.119
Must be reassuring to know
that however bad life gets,

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.159
you're not me.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.199
It is.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.359
Good. That means every time you're down,
you have to come and hang out with me.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.519
Yeah, I think I might.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.919
Starting with today.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.119
I've got Nicos's ticket
for the boat party.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.159
Do you fancy joining me?

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.639
Um, yes.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.879
More than anything.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.079
Great. On one condition, though.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.439
Anything.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.079
At no point are you allowed
to say, "I told you so."

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.679
Ooh, not sure I can guarantee that.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.359
So it's not that I'd rather go
to a party that infinitely heightens

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.559
my sense of being out of kilter
with the rest of the world,

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.399
it's just that Alison is sort of
the fittest girl I've ever met

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.319
- and maybe...
- It's fine, Will, honestly.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.159
Go for it, I'll just find a quiet spot
and hang myself.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.359
Great. Lucy, make sure
he doesn't hang himself.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.119
I'm off. Look at me,
following my cock like a normal person.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.879
Sorry for saying cock.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.359
I didn't realise
I was being such a dick.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.119
You were.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.999
- I'm trying to say sorry.
- Well, say it, then.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.519
Sorry.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.199
For being a dick.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.919
Sorry for being a dick.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.959
And for having too much gel
in your hair.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.679
I don't think I've got that much...

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.519
OK, I'm sorry for having
too much gel in my hair.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.479
You should probably get going.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.999
I'm not that bothered.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.039
Really?

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.279
Yeah.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.159
If you like, maybe we could hang out,
the two of us.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.119
I quite fancy just staying by the pool.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.839
Yeah, I mean, why spend the day
having unbelievable fun on the party boat

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.359
when you could be taking a depressed man
swimming at a family hotel?

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.439
I'm serious.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.999
I don't mind.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.919
I might even cheer you up...

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.799
if they let you back in.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.479
I honestly don't think
I'll be very good company,

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.119
but thanks for the offer.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.359
You go, I'll be all right.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.759
Look...

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.319
it's obvious how much
Carli means to you.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.159
She's lucky...

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.319
I think.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.919
I'm sure you'll sort it out.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.039
She goes back tomorrow.
I can feel her slipping away.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.239
Simon...

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.959
if she really means that much to you,

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.719
I want you to take my ticket.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.279
Lucy...

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.519
If you really want to go, take it.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.599
If you really want to go.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.279
God, you'd do that for me?

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.159
Yeah.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.119
Thanks!

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.479
I'll see you later,
enjoy the pool! Will!

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.079
Will! I got a ticket, I got a ticket!

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.679
Will!

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.359
I got a ticket, I got a ticket!

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.119
# We are go!

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.679
# The time has come to leave this place

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.559
# Leave it all behind

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.199
# There's so much more here to envision

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.879
# Out of your mind... #

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.359
WILL: The boat party
was Jay's promised land...

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.039
sun, sea, booze, and who knows,

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.079
maybe even some sex, minge,
fanny and tits...and booze...and sex.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.159
Mental!

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.639
- Cheeky shot to get us started?
- You are kidding.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.719
Oh, come on, it's the best cure.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.119
Fair enough, what are we toasting?

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.399
To the Pussay!

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.199
ALL: The Pussay!

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.079
Neil?

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.479
To being playas!

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.239
ALL: Playas!

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.839
Si?

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.919
To me and Carli!

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.879
- No, you're all right, mate.
- Fuck off.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.159
Fine. Well, I'm going off
to find her, anyway.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.679
- Oh, Si, I forgot something.
- What?

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.679
Ah! For fuck's sake.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.639
You know I should probably find Jane,
I promised her a dance.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:58.759
- What?
- Well, no, just a dance.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.719
And then we can get
some proper fit gash.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.799
But Jane's all right, you know.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.919
She's a laugh.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.159
The fat ones are always jolly.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.159
Neil, what a horrible thing to say.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.599
- Just you and me, then, Will.
- Oh, no.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.199
Oh, God.
What was I thinking, tequila?!

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.479
Shit, sorry!

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.799
Sorry!

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.079
Make your bloody mind up, you wally!

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.399
(SIGHS)

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.719
Richard! All right, mate?

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.919
- All right!
- How's it going?

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:56.999
Yeah, not too bad.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.399
I was DJing at this techno club, right?

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.439
And this mental emo bird
comes over to me and says,

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.239
"I want you to piss on me
and then fuck me."

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.359
So I pissed all over her.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.399
And then fucked her?

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.559
No, she was covered in piss!

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.599
Oh, course.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.639
Anyway, the other day, right?

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.519
I started crying and couldn't stop,

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.239
so yeah, my mum and dad have flown over
to take me home. Pretty cool.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.759
Yeah...

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.999
Come and say hello?

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.719
All right.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.319
Dad, Mum.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.479
All right...

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.039
Back off, bitch!

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.959
Not this time.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:41.879
Jane?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.879
- Jane!
- Oh, hello.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.879
Sure you want to be seen with me?

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.679
Yeah, I do. I really do.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.919
Can we have that snog now?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.439
What? Now? Here?
Right in front of everyone?

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.639
Um...yeah. Yeah.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.279
Yeah? Well, I'm not that kind of girl.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.719
Oh.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.839
(POSH VOICE) So, I suggest
we find somewhere a little more private.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.119
- I don't mind.
- I told you,

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.159
I do. And, to be fair, in private
you might get a blow job out of it.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.519
- Simey!
- Oh, hi!

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.719
Carli!

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.759
Where have you been?

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.319
- I've been looking all over for you.
- I need to tell you something.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.239
Ssh! I know.

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:51.999
Get it all up.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.319
Little easier
on the sunburnt cock, please.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.479
Sorry.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.639
It's fine.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.359
I mean, what a total twat!

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.399
Me?!

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.599
No, Nicos, the total
and utter Greek twat.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.679
Did you see her?

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.919
She was hideous,
she must have been at least 30.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.679
I told you so.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.559
You arsehole, you had to say it,
didn't you?

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.239
Even in the fucking state you're in,

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:17.799
- you couldn't resist.
- Sorry. But at least I'm consistent.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.199
Yes, you are, aren't you?

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.559
OK, so I think I'd like
to revise my offer.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.439
How about instead of having sex
with you in a year,

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.799
I have sex with you all year?

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.719
What?

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.679
- It's a one-time offer.
- To confirm,

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.919
do you mean like a girlfriend
or like a prostitute?

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.519
I was thinking more like a girlfriend.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:47.439
- Could you write it...
- No! I am not going to write it down.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.599
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
I like you.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.759
Despite myself, I really do like you.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.799
If you like me too, then we're on.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.119
Um...but not till you've
brushed your teeth.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.079
Oh!

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.399
- That should do it.
- You know we could do this for ever.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.439
Yeah, I know, yeah.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.239
Oh, God, Carls, I thought I'd lost you.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.599
I thought I'd lost you!

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.959
And no matter how many times they hit me
in the balls, I knew I was right.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.199
And I've worked it all out,
it was so simple.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.719
I'll just get a job near your uni
for three years,

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.999
four if you do an MA,
and then we can be together for ever.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.479
For ever.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.679
Just like we should be.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.559
Carli...

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.079
...what's wrong?

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.839
Did you hear what I said?

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.359
Something about being hit in the balls?

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.039
Well, yeah, but...

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.159
mainly about being together for ever.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.639
Sorry, Simon,
could you just kiss me again?

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.759
Sorry, Carls, this is wrong.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.039
What?

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.959
I've made a bad choice today.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.039
I honestly wish you
all the best with your life,

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.199
but right now, I have to leave.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.839
I don't think you'll ever see me again.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.679
But I'll see you at your mum's birthday
in two weeks' time.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.639
Well, yeah, but then after that.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.079
And then your brother's 16th
the following week.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.399
Yeah, it was more
of a metaphorical thing.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.919
- Anyway, I'll see you around, Carls.
- Yes,

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.839
- at your mum's.
- Please, can I just...

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.039
Thank you.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.359
Below deck, Neil was being as faithful
as ever to his girlfriend,

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.359
by aggressively dry-humping Lisa
to within an inch of her life.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.839
Neil...

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.679
Neil, stop.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.399
What's up? Is it my zip?
I can undo it, if you want.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.959
No, it's not that.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.559
I just think this is wrong.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.639
I feel bad for your girlfriend.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.679
- No, it's fine, we aren't kissing.
- Yeah, but...

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.599
look at what we are doing.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.679
I mean, how do you think you'd feel
if you saw her doing this with a guy?

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.999
I wouldn't want to be treated like this.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.479
- I've got ethics.
- Yeah.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.319
Yeah, you're right,
it's just that, um...

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.159
...Nicole dumped me
before we got out here

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.039
and I didn't want to say anything
to the others cos I was embarrassed.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.119
- Oh, Neil...
- Yeah.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.199
She sent me this text, saying like,
"You dance like a twat, you are dumped."

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.399
It broke me up.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.119
So...this is fine and, if you want,
we can even kiss.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.959
Oh, Neil!

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.559
Is that true? Really?

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.359
Yeah, course.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.479
If you like.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.319
That was just... I mean...

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.199
Did it not taste funny?
Cos it looks funny.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.479
All right, mate, who's this, then?

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.799
Hi, I'm Jane.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.879
- She's my girlfriend.
- Oh, is she?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.559
Fuckin' hell, you want to be careful
she doesn't fall overboard

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.799
- cos...
- Cos I'll get harpooned?

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.079
Cos they might think I'm a new island?

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.079
Cos all the water will splash out
onto the land?

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.999
I've heard them all, take your pick.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.559
Fuckin' 'ell, tubs, all right,
it was only a joke.

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.639
Anyway, seeing as you're coming
out there like a naughty boy,

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.759
how about you do me a favour?
I need a note for the old toot.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.599
We weren't doing drugs, actually.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.199
Christ, for his sake, I hope you were.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.119
There are laws against fucking cow,
mate, even in Greece.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.679
Now, I'm going to need to take that note
off you. You're a mate.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.679
You don't mind, do you?

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.199
Give.

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.079
No, no, not at all.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.599
There you are, mate, already rolled.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.439
Cheers. I'll keep this, yeah?

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.759
No problemo.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.799
WILL: I think the Government's
anti-drugs campaign

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.639
would be more successful
if they pointed out

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.759
that every now and again,

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.599
there's a small chance you might
accidentally snort some poo.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.999
(RETCHES)

01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.719
Simon?

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.239
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.759
Yeah, for the first time in my life,
I think I actually am.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.919
I'm clear, anyway.

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:06.999
How'd it go with Carli?

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.879
Long term - good. Short term - horrific.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.959
Have you murdered her?

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.959
No, but I am starting to think
that maybe Carli's not all that.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.199
Well, it's taken a while.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.439
- Better late than never.
- I think Lucy might be the one.

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.519
Yes, obviously.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.559
Lucy's much nicer
and actually likes you.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.559
But I'm worried I might have been
a bit of a dick to her.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:26.279
You've been more than a bit of a dick
to her. You've been a massive dick to her.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.999
She still likes you, anyway.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.399
Good, that's really good.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.719
Does he always strip when he's happy?

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.839
Yeah, normally.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.959
Simon!
You can't go up there, there's a sign.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.239
Oh, sign(!)

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.239
Alison, will you text Lucy
and tell her I'm coming to get her?

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.399
Course I will.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.679
Brilliant!

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.799
All right?

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.919
Yeah.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.079
What are you doing up there, then?

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.439
I'm going to swim back to shore
and tell Lucy how I feel.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.799
How romantic.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.359
It is, isn't it?

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.439
Is it a bit far?

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.079
No, bollocks. You can see the shore.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.759
I've swum further than that underwater.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.559
Do it! Just swim there

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.559
and show her what she means to you
and then kiss her.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.599
On the fanny!

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.919
- Jay!
- Sorry, darling.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.999
Right, fuck it, you only live once.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.359
(CHEERING)

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.959
ALL: Jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump, jump!

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.599
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.719
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump!

01:29:45.440 --> 01:30:12.279
(CHEERING)

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.399
I think he might be drowning.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.239
Simon!

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.039
Oh, I think I've shit myself.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.439
Lucy, it's normally bigger, it was cold.

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.359
WILL: One of us should probably have
gone to hospital with Simon.

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:40.239
But, to be perfectly honest,
we had more important things to do.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.039
( # SEAN KINGSTON: Party All Night)

To try and get your money back

# Got caught trying to break in

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.679
# But just laughed and said

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.439
# It couldn't have been me

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.919
# She shaved off her hair
Said that she didn't care

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.639
# That life is so unfair
Oh, but all she wanted

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.159
# Was to be left alone

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.159
# He said he missed bliss
Smiled and left a kiss

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.679
# And I said this isn't it
But, baby, please come home

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.279
# And start again

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.239

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.599
# She wore lip gloss
Cried when she got cross

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.999
# And all that she had was lost
Yeah, she sold it all

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.119
# All for pearls

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.119
# He said he missed bliss
Smiled and left a kiss

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:18.759
