All day, you sat there

30:42.440 --> 30:44.783
over who owns this land.

You never say anything
about the fact

that youused to own
this farm.

I sold my half interest
in the farm to your daddy

Your daddy hated him.

Said he was bad news
and forbid me to see him.

Bought this place.

31:37.460 --> 31:41.237
Things between Ernest
and I weren't the same.

31:41.290 --> 31:45.852
And over time,
got so we barely spoke.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.980
At your grandmama's funeral,

31:50.030 --> 31:55.127
we literally did not say
one word to each other.

31:55.170 --> 31:59.163
I didn't know that night
whether I was crying

31:59.220 --> 32:01.472
because my mama
was dead and gone

32:01.520 --> 32:04.785
or because my brother
was alive and gone.

getting rough with me.

I kept that to myself.

When your daddy
found out...

32:25.810 --> 32:28.449
it didn't matter _
that we weren't speaking.

32:30.030 --> 32:32.203
He came back
from California

32:32.250 --> 32:34.377

When I filed
for divorce,

I...

sold my half of the farm
to your daddy,

32:57.230 --> 33:00.961
bought out Jimmy
and paid up my mortgage.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.534
But you had to give up
your family inheritance
to get it.

Mm-hmm,
and I would do it again
in a hot second.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.968
I was angry
at your daddy
for years.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.713
Then...

33:16.290 --> 33:18.986
he apologized to me...

33:21.690 --> 33:23.510
[voice breaks ]
for not protecting me.

33:25.740 --> 33:27.253
I never got over that.

I was wrong.

But when it counted,
he was there.

33:38.100 --> 33:41.183
Yeah, I lost the land,

33:41.230 --> 33:45.974
but I got back my freedom,
independence,

33:46.020 --> 33:49.456
and, most important,
I got my brother back.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.754

the better part
of the deal.

I had to give him

It was a strategic move.

Hmm.

What?

34:55.180 --> 34:56.477
You know...

34:59.140 --> 35:03.395
I had heard so much
about you before we met.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.522
Every time the farmers
got together,

35:05.580 --> 35:09.664
your dad had
at least one story
about your last success.

35:09.710 --> 35:12.531
Folks would say,
"Well, of course,
'cause she's so smart."

35:12.580 --> 35:16.937
And Ernest said...

35:16.980 --> 35:18.675
"smart" was
the wrong word.

35:18.720 --> 35:22.326
- No, he insisted
on "thoughtful."
-Hmm.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.325
So when you decided
to buy this place

35:24.380 --> 35:27.076
and stand up for the farmers,
that made sense to me,

35:27.120 --> 35:30.078
'cause it was both smart
and con5iderat_e of
your community.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.384
- It was thoughtful,
right?
-Mmm.

But now I wonder...

35:37.780 --> 35:40.044
ifI misunderstood
your father.

35:40.090 --> 35:43.002
Yeah, maybe--

35:43.050 --> 35:45.780
maybe "thoughtful"...

35:45.830 --> 35:47.388
meant "
calculating."

35:49.010 --> 35:51.137
You're using my father
against me

35:51.190 --> 35:55.661

of a choice I made for mylife?

that he was bragging about

36:08.290 --> 36:10.463
