00:35.953 --> 00:37.955
[radio static]

00:38.038 --> 00:40.916
[Winston Churchill]
Twice in a single generation,

00:40.999 --> 00:45.295
the catastrophe of world war
has fallen upon us.

00:46.004 --> 00:50.092
Twice in our lifetime
has the long arm of fate

00:50.175 --> 00:52.135
reached out across the oceans

00:52.219 --> 00:55.931
to bring the United States
into the forefront of the battle.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.810
[Franklin D. Roosevelt] Our American
merchant ships must be free

00:59.893 --> 01:04.313
to carry our American goods
into the harbors of our friends.

01:04.397 --> 01:10.279
And our American merchant ships
must be protected by our American Navy.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.450
[Churchill] The brunt of the war
has fallen upon the sailormen,

01:15.534 --> 01:18.787
and we have lost nearly 3,000 lives

01:18.871 --> 01:23.000
in a hard, unrelenting struggle,

01:23.083 --> 01:26.670
which goes on night and day

01:26.753 --> 01:30.883
and is going on now
without a moment's respite.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.845
[Roosevelt] The goods will be
delivered by this nation,

01:34.928 --> 01:38.682
whose navy believes in the tradition

01:39.183 --> 01:42.352
of "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead."

02:42.287 --> 02:44.706
[thunder rumbling]

03:08.981 --> 03:12.943
[man] "Dear Lord,
let your holy angel be with me,

03:13.026 --> 03:17.739
that the evil foe may have no power
over me. Amen."

03:24.913 --> 03:26.915
[water running]

03:29.543 --> 03:30.752
[water stops]

03:46.185 --> 03:48.562
-[piano music]
-[chattering]

03:49.313 --> 03:50.647
Merry Christmas.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.777
[chattering continues]

04:11.543 --> 04:12.711
[woman] Merry Christmas.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.296
Cigars?

04:19.051 --> 04:21.386
"Yesterday, today and forever."

04:21.470 --> 04:24.389
That's beautiful. I'll put it on my tree.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.602
[sighs] All right. Your turn. Come on.

04:28.685 --> 04:29.895
All right.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.195
Monogrammed.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.658
What's this?

04:44.910 --> 04:46.370
Congratulations.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.872
Your first command. At last.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.415
Aw.

04:51.542 --> 04:55.712
After all those years of being fitted
and retained, a Fletcher-class destroyer.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.256
You deserve it.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.509
I knew after Pearl Harbor
they would be needing men like you.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.137
I report to Norfolk
right after the first of the year.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.516
Norfolk? Not Treasure Island?

05:07.599 --> 05:09.518
That's the navy in a nutshell, isn't it?

05:10.185 --> 05:11.228
Yeah.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.357
Then the Caribbean
for training and tactics.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.944
Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba.
Rum and Coca-Cola.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.238
-Mm.
-Then active duty.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.740
Come with me.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.534
[chuckles]

05:25.617 --> 05:26.994
I mean it.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.583
So I can ask you to marry me
on a tropical beach.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.547
Oh, I'd like that, but we can't.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.843
The world has gone crazy, Ernie.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.137
Let's wait until we can be together.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.532
I will always be looking for you, Evie.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.160
No matter where I am.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.788
Even if I'm a thousand miles away,

06:11.872 --> 06:15.042
I will be hoping I'll see you
come around the corner.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.547
Because when you do, it's--
it's the greatest feeling in the world.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.204
-Morning.
-[men] Morning, Captain.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.873
Charlie, how are the overnights?

06:54.957 --> 06:56.542
Convoy's three days into the Pit.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.253
No contacts, no incidents,
except on your ship, sir.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.881
Two bored sailors with time
on their hands, which became fists.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.967
-Who?
-Shannon and Flusser.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.386
-Crew's getting nervous, Ernie.
-Sleep well, sir?

07:08.011 --> 07:10.180
I've never had the gift
for sleeping onboard.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.933
Hmm. And I can't sleep anywhere else, sir.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.232
-Amen.
-[man] Amen.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.609
Sea's a bit high to serve hot food.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.862
I could manage a ham steak
and eggs for you, sir.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.239
-This will do. Thank you, Cleveland.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

07:30.075 --> 07:33.120
Report to the commanding officer.
Clear the room.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.211
Uncover.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.387
[sighs]

07:55.893 --> 07:57.144
Explain yourselves.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.105
Flusser.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.024
I regret the incident, sir.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.818
Shannon.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.071
I too regret the incident.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.753
I will tolerate no more fisticuffs
on my ship.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.379
So...

08:24.463 --> 08:28.217
"restore the relationships you have
damaged and fill me with peace."

08:33.096 --> 08:34.097
Sir?

08:35.349 --> 08:38.227
[man on PA] Captain requested,
bridge, sir. Captain requested, bridge.

08:40.895 --> 08:44.608
Repetition will bring hell
down from on high.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.111
Back to your duties.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.447
Count your blessings.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.158
[man] Captain on the bridge.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.661
[man 2] Aye.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.037
Sir, good morning.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.374
Escorts Eagle and Harry are
out of position, six miles from convoy.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.919
They've been off on their own, sir,
for roughly two hours.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.308
Eagle skipper announced,
"Starting the day with a good hunt," sir,

09:18.392 --> 09:19.726
and then Harry joined in.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.782
[messenger]
Message from the commodore, sir.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.325
Read it out.

09:35.409 --> 09:39.413
"Comconvoy to Comescort.
H-U-F-F D-U-F-F"--

09:39.496 --> 09:42.749
"Huff Duff." High-frequency
direction finding. Continue, please.

09:43.709 --> 09:47.254
"Huff Duff reports a German transmission
bearing 087 degrees.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.548
Range 15 to 20 miles."

09:49.631 --> 09:51.425
Commodore says a likely U-boat, sir.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.183
"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."

09:59.266 --> 10:00.893
"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."

10:00.976 --> 10:02.477
Wait, wait. "Will run it down. Thank you."

10:02.561 --> 10:03.896
"Will run it down. Thank you."
Aye, aye, sir.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.523
-Mister Carling, I have the conn.
-Captain has the conn.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.650
All ahead full. Make turns for 36 knots.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.403
All ahead full.
Make turns for 36 knots. Aye, sir.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.363
Right standard rudder, 079.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.657
[helmsman] Right standard rudder to 079.
Aye, aye, sir.

10:18.410 --> 10:22.623
All escorts, Greyhound.
Return to your stations immediately.

10:22.706 --> 10:27.753
We have enemy contact bearing 087,
range 15 to 20 miles.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.213
-[man 1] Aye, sir.
-[man 2] Aye, aye, sir.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.839
-[man 3] Aye, Greyhound.
-Dicky, Greyhound.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.384
-Dicky, sir.
-Modify your station to assist the convoy

10:34.468 --> 10:35.761
on the starboard side.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.347
Stragglers are mistiming
the course change.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.266
Keep your sonar on that starboard flank.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.602
[Dicky]
Aye, sir. Sonar, starboard flank.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.895
[Ernie]
Right full rudder, 087.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.105
[helmsman] Right full rudder to 087.
Aye, aye, sir.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.775
-Bring us up to general quarters.
-Boatswain, sound general quarters.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.612
[siren blaring]

10:54.363 --> 10:55.697
General quarters, general quarters...

10:55.781 --> 10:57.658
-[man] Move. Let's go.
-...all hands, man your battle stations.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.868
We are running down
a possible U-boat contact.

11:00.536 --> 11:04.581
[siren continues blaring]

11:06.083 --> 11:07.668
[man 1] Let's hammer
those sons of bitches.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.295
[man 2] Keep 'em coming, Cleveland.

11:13.382 --> 11:16.426
[Ernie] Eagle, Greyhound. Take
my position at the front of the convoy.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.970
We're pursuing the target.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.888
Dicky, Greyhound. Cover the right flank.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.890
[Eagle] Front of convoy. Aye, aye, sir.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.892
[Dicky] Aye, sir. Covering right flank.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.144
Eagle, Harry, Greyhound.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.438
What is your ETA
for resuming new stations?

11:28.981 --> 11:31.733
Greyhound, Eagle.
We can be at our station in 20 minutes.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.696
Harry, sir. We're now four miles
to port of the convoy.

11:35.779 --> 11:39.908
Yes, I know, Harry.
Return to your station at best speed.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.995
Sir, I relieved Mister Carling.
Have the deck and the conn.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.790
Mister Watson, we have a target
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.917
-I have the conn.
-Aye, aye, sir. Captain has the conn.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.294
-[Ernie] Messenger.
-Sir.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.629
Go to my cabin and bring me
my sheepskin coat. You'll find it.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.714
Aye, aye, sir.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.758
Combat, Conn. Charlie.

11:56.842 --> 12:01.638
We're running down a likely sub
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.308
I'm hoping it shows up
on your surface radar.

12:05.184 --> 12:06.727
Conn, Combat. Aye, aye, sir.

12:09.897 --> 12:13.275
[man blowing pipe]

12:14.568 --> 12:15.611
[blowing stops]

12:15.694 --> 12:17.613
Now hear this, now hear this.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.158
This is the captain.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.910
We are running down the target.

12:22.993 --> 12:26.580
Let us attend our duties well.
This is what we've trained for.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.916
-Martin, what you got?
-Nothing yet, sir.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.844
-[clicking]
-[Martin] Got him.

12:42.304 --> 12:47.267
Conn, Combat. Target bearing 092,
range 15 miles.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.144
Charlie, what do you make of this target?

12:49.228 --> 12:50.979
Most likely a U-boat, sir.

12:51.063 --> 12:54.525
Up for air and a battery charge.
Gettin' ready to come at us, Captain.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.988
[Watson]
Steady on 092, sir.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.698
Very well.

13:06.453 --> 13:11.708
Conn, Combat. Target bearing steady
at 094, range 12 miles.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.795
Weapons, pass the word,
do not open fire without orders from me.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.761
Range 11 miles, bearing steady on 094.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.681
Range 11 miles, bearing steady on 094.

13:25.764 --> 13:30.394
[helmsman whistling]

13:33.689 --> 13:35.023
[Watson] Stop that noise.

13:35.107 --> 13:38.527
Range 9.5 miles, bearing steady on 094.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.781
Close enough for the five-inch, sir.

13:44.575 --> 13:47.160
Heavy seas, Mister Watson,
with only a radar bearing.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.788
Let's have our eyes on him.

13:49.872 --> 13:50.873
Aye, aye, sir.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.967
[waves crashing]

14:13.979 --> 14:17.274
Target's disappeared, sir.
Fell off the radar about six miles out.

14:18.817 --> 14:19.902
What's this, Charlie?

14:19.985 --> 14:21.695
Looks like he's dived, sir,
by the way the pips faded out.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.281
He must've seen us, sir.
Got his air and dove.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.742
Pips had him on course for us
and the convoy, sir.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.368
Can you plot a search radius?

14:28.452 --> 14:31.872
I could, sir, but in ten minutes,
the radius would be three square miles.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.126
Give me a course to intercept

14:36.210 --> 14:38.921
if the target maintains this course
at six knots.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.047
Aye, aye, sir.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.526
Conn, Combat.
Course to intercept is 096.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.570
Warn me two miles out from this intercept.

15:03.654 --> 15:04.780
Aye, aye, sir.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.615
Right handsomely, 096.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.909
[helmsman] Right handsomely to 096.
Aye, aye, sir.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.428
[Watson] Combat reports
two miles from intercept, sir.

15:29.179 --> 15:32.266
Mister Watson, we need to slow down
for sonar. Make turns for 22 knots.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.226
[Watson] Make turns for 22 knots,
aye, aye, sir.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.228
All ahead standard.
Make turns at 22 knots.

15:39.565 --> 15:40.691
Here we go, boys.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.026
[talker] We're at sonar speed.

15:43.110 --> 15:47.114
[sonar pinging]

15:51.994 --> 15:54.371
Contact bearing 091, range indefinite.

15:55.414 --> 15:56.665
Put that on the radiator.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.458
Sir, message from the Admiralty.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.170
Contact bearing 091, range unknown, sir.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.505
[sonar pinging continues]

16:05.257 --> 16:06.592
What do you hear?

16:08.218 --> 16:10.053
Contact bearing steady at 091.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.347
He's turned.
Looks like he's running from us, sir.

16:12.431 --> 16:13.432
Any screw noises?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.145
[pinging continues]

16:19.271 --> 16:22.274
Contact dead ahead, range one mile.
Still no propeller noise.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.819
Come left to 091.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.696
[helmsman] Come left to 091.
Aye, aye, sir.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.167
[pinging]

16:40.250 --> 16:41.960
[sighs] Contact lost.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.462
[talker] Sonar reports contact lost, sir.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.673
Sonar, search ahead 30 degrees
port and starboard.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.008
[talker]
...30 degrees port and starboard.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.468
Sonar. Searching ahead 30 degrees
port and starboard.

16:49.551 --> 16:52.304
-[helmsman] Steady on 091, sir.
-Very well.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.102
[clicking]

16:59.186 --> 17:01.396
[pinging]

17:04.397 --> 17:05.400
Contact bearing...

17:05.483 --> 17:07.944
[talker] Contact bearing 066,
range indefinite, sir.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.738
Left hard rudder.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.867
Ease the rudder.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.746
[helmsman]
Easing the turn. Aye, aye, sir.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.958

This was an all-hands job.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.231

23:17.314 --> 23:18.398
[Ernie] Well done.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.336
[Harry] The prize is yours, sir,

23:39.419 --> 23:41.672
but we'll need evidence of a kill
for the Admiralty.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.258
Nothin' but the captain's trousers
will do, I'm afraid.

23:44.341 --> 23:45.717
Just return to station.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.053
Congratulations, sir.

23:48.136 --> 23:50.639
Shall I steer a course for the debris
to verify the kill?

23:52.474 --> 23:53.767
No, Mister Watson.

23:53.851 --> 23:55.894
Convoy is unguarded.
Take us back to station.

24:07.656 --> 24:11.243
Hey, Cap, pulled this corned beef
and onion, sliced thick for you.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.494
Gotta eat, sir.

24:12.578 --> 24:15.330
Nah, take that to Lieutenant Cole.

24:15.414 --> 24:17.249
I bet he's worked up an appetite.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.377
Now, Mister Dawson.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.753
It's from the Admiralty, sir.

24:21.837 --> 24:24.506
They've intercepted
multiple German transmissions.

25:04.421 --> 25:05.714
Yes, sir, I am, sir.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.050
Then take that to the chief engineer
without bothering me.

25:08.133 --> 25:11.470
Aye, sir.
Uh, our noon position report, sir.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.306
I'm estimating we are at Position Oboe

25:14.389 --> 25:16.350

surrounded by open sea.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.143
-That about right?
-If you say so, sir.

25:54.179 --> 25:55.222
Yes, thank you.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.394
[man] Sir,

26:00.477 --> 26:03.730
noon fuel reports will be slightly off
due to that U-boat chase.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.190
Still waiting on reports from Dodge,

26:05.274 --> 26:08.026
but Viktor and James are reporting
diminishing reserves.

26:08.110 --> 26:09.444
Send a reply.

26:11.071 --> 26:15.367
"Comescort to James. Please use
utmost efforts to conserve fuel."

26:15.450 --> 26:16.493
Aye, sir.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.788
Sir, after that last pattern,
now might be a good time

26:19.872 --> 26:22.291
to bring up the extra supply of depth
charges stowed in the crew quarters.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.376

30:44.178 --> 30:45.345
I need you down below.

30:45.429 --> 30:47.681
Keep an eye on the surface radar
for our friend back here.

30:47.764 --> 30:48.849
Aye, aye, sir.

31:11.580 --> 31:14.208
Six subs, guys.
We got a contact report from Eagle?

31:14.291 --> 31:16.418
[man] Aye, sir, got 'em all.
They're keeping their distance.

31:16.502 --> 31:19.254
Five ahead of the convoy
and our little dance partner back here,

31:19.338 --> 31:22.674
tracking us and the Cadena.
Presumed bearing 196.

31:51.703 --> 31:53.580
-Signal from the commodore, sir.
-Read it out.

31:54.206 --> 31:55.749
"Comconvoy to Comescort.

31:55.832 --> 31:59.461
Numerous German language transmissions
10 to 15 miles ahead. Various bearings."

32:00.212 --> 32:01.213
Very well.

32:01.296 --> 32:04.174
I need the gloves you'll find
in my cabin. The fur, not the knit.

32:04.258 --> 32:05.801
Gloves. Fur, not knit. Aye, aye, sir.

32:17.563 --> 32:20.691
[grunts] Chief Rudel,
I need these wipers operating.

32:20.774 --> 32:23.026
It's not electrical, sir. They're frozen.

32:23.110 --> 32:25.487
I can put some men on it
with buckets and swabs.

32:25.571 --> 32:27.781
Salt water. Warm salt water, not boiling.

32:27.865 --> 32:29.074
Aye, sir.

32:30.993 --> 32:33.537
Conn, Combat. Looks like our friend's
come up for fresh air

32:33.620 --> 32:35.247
and to maintain speed with us, sir.

32:35.330 --> 32:39.501
Contact bearing 207, range three miles.

32:39.585 --> 32:41.503
Hard right rudder to 207.

32:41.587 --> 32:43.755
[helmsman 2] Hard right rudder to 207.
Aye, sir.

32:51.889 --> 32:55.475
[Martin]
Target now bears 208.

32:56.310 --> 32:59.396
Target now bears 208. Range...

32:59.479 --> 33:01.940
Range looks like 2.5 miles.

33:02.024 --> 33:03.650
Looks like 2.5 miles.

33:03.734 --> 33:05.027
-What's goin' on?
-I don't know, sir.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.278
I can't get a good read.

33:09.031 --> 33:10.741
Come right to 220.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.826
[helmsman]
Come right to 220. Aye, sir.

33:12.910 --> 33:16.079
What do you mean, "looks like"?
I need a bearing on this target, Charlie.

33:16.163 --> 33:17.706
It's my radar, sir. It's gone soft.

33:17.789 --> 33:20.083
-I need Rudel down here.
-Understood.

33:20.626 --> 33:23.045
Have Chief Rudel report to the XO
in the CIC.

33:23.128 --> 33:24.880
Mister Lopez, all mounts, local control.

33:24.963 --> 33:26.507
-Fire when they bear.
-Aye, aye, sir.

33:26.590 --> 33:29.760
All mounts, local control.
Fire as you bear.

33:31.678 --> 33:34.473
[Martin]
Bearing's changing. Uh, 203. Range--

33:34.556 --> 33:37.434
Contact bearing's changing, 203.

33:37.518 --> 33:41.480
-Range looks like 2.5 miles.
-203, range 2.5 miles.

33:41.563 --> 33:43.190
[Lopez] Firing on target, starboard bow.

33:43.273 --> 33:44.733
Left standard rudder to 180.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.944
[helmsman]
Left standard rudder to 180. Aye, sir.

33:47.027 --> 33:50.364
-[lookout] U-boat, starboard bow!
-[cannons firing]

33:59.873 --> 34:02.835
[talker] Fire Control reports
five-inch mounts opened fire on target.

34:02.918 --> 34:04.920
Eleven rounds fired.
No hits observed, sir.

34:05.003 --> 34:06.880
Left standard rudder to 100.

34:06.964 --> 34:10.175
-[helmsman] Left standard rudder to 100.
-Messenger, take this to Signals.

34:10.259 --> 34:11.552
"Greyhound to Cadena.

34:11.635 --> 34:15.138
Must return to station at head of convoy
to engage targets.

34:15.222 --> 34:17.056
Fired on U-boat. Drove him under.

34:17.139 --> 34:20.268
Have faith you will outrun him.
Good luck."

34:20.351 --> 34:21.395
Send that.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.063
[Rudel] You wanted to see me, sir?

34:23.146 --> 34:24.898
Yeah. What can we do
about this damn interference?

34:24.982 --> 34:27.109
It's not interference, sir.
I checked everything.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.735
The pilot light's on, no surge currents,

34:28.819 --> 34:30.654
and I reset the overload relay
four days ago.

34:30.737 --> 34:35.449
I could reset it again, but we're gonna be
down nearly two hours. Waste of time, sir.

34:37.369 --> 34:38.411
[radio: buzz]

34:41.540 --> 34:42.541
Bridge.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.252
"The night cometh
when no man can work," Ernie.

34:45.335 --> 34:47.129
Rudel's done all he can.

34:47.212 --> 34:50.340
We're just gonna have to live with
the radar how it is for now, Captain.

34:50.924 --> 34:52.509
Understood. Thank you, Charlie.

35:25.042 --> 35:27.920
[wind whistling]

35:32.299 --> 35:34.676
[creaking, rattling]

35:37.638 --> 35:41.225
[man on radio] Captain, need to slow
in the sea, or we risk blowing a turbine.

35:41.308 --> 35:42.684
Understood.

35:42.768 --> 35:44.937
Mister Harbutt, she can't take it.
Slow us down a bit.

35:45.020 --> 35:47.564
-All ahead two-thirds.
-All ahead two-thirds. Aye, aye, sir.

35:47.648 --> 35:49.858
-Darken the ship.
-[Harbutt] Shift to red.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.194
[Cleveland]
You missed another meal, sir.

35:52.277 --> 35:54.905
Brought you a bacon and egg sandwich,
still warm.

35:54.988 --> 35:56.740
I found some of those peaches you like.

36:04.706 --> 36:05.707
Amen.

36:05.791 --> 36:06.792
Amen.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.335
I'll keep the coffee coming, sir.

36:08.794 --> 36:10.754
-Coffee, Mister Harbutt?
-Thank you, sir.

36:13.382 --> 36:14.675
[distant explosions]

36:14.758 --> 36:16.134
[talker] Distress rockets, sir.

36:16.218 --> 36:19.388
Lookouts report gunfire, bearing 046,
range three miles.

36:19.471 --> 36:21.265
[explosions continue]

36:21.348 --> 36:23.392
-I'll take it, Mister Harbutt.
-Captain has the conn.

36:23.475 --> 36:26.061
-Bring us up to general quarters.
-Boatswain Mate, Condition 1.

36:26.144 --> 36:28.564
[Ernie] Left full rudder. Steer us across
the front of the convoy.

36:28.647 --> 36:30.440
[man] General quarters, general quarters.

36:30.524 --> 36:32.150
All hands, man your battle stations.

36:32.234 --> 36:35.445
Set Condition 1 throughout the ship.
Lock down all watertight passageways.

36:35.529 --> 36:38.991
[talker] Combat reports sub bearing 036.
One and a half miles, sir.

36:40.117 --> 36:41.577

36:48.375 --> 36:49.835

37:40.511 --> 37:42.054
All ahead standard. Aye, aye, sir.

37:42.137 --> 37:43.514

Where?

37:50.229 --> 37:54.358
U-boat bearing 012, range 1,000!
Between us and the freighters!

37:55.150 --> 37:56.985
[explosions]

38:02.658 --> 38:04.743
Check! Check! Check!

38:04.826 --> 38:07.162
Mister Lopez,
you have freighters in the line of fire!

38:07.246 --> 38:09.831
-[Lopez] Cease fire, cease fire.
-All batteries, check fire!

38:09.915 --> 38:11.834
[men] Cease fire! Cease fire!

38:16.463 --> 38:19.424
[Ernie] Friendly fire, friendly fire!
They can't see us!

38:23.512 --> 38:26.390
[screaming]

38:30.227 --> 38:31.562
[Ernie] Close up, close up!

38:31.645 --> 38:34.064
Man that telegraph!
Get replacements up here!

38:38.652 --> 38:41.113
-Right full rudder, all ahead two-thirds.
-Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

38:41.196 --> 38:43.407
Mister Lopez,
prepare to engage that target.

38:43.490 --> 38:46.118
When he dives, we're gonna hammer him
with two patterns: shallow, then deep.

38:46.201 --> 38:47.119
[Lopez] Aye, sir!

38:47.202 --> 38:51.248
[Harbutt] That's the Vasco, sir!
She's an oil tanker. She could blow!

38:53.166 --> 38:54.751
Mind your helm across the column!

38:54.835 --> 38:56.128
[helmsman]
Minding my helm. Aye, aye, sir.

38:56.211 --> 38:58.463
-Slow to one-third.
-[talker] Slow to one-third. Aye, sir.

38:58.547 --> 39:00.716
-Watch that merchantman.
-Aye, sir.

39:02.759 --> 39:06.096
[lookout] He's diving!
U-boat diving, bearing 040.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.389
Range close aboard!

39:08.223 --> 39:09.516
-Mister Lopez.
-Aye, sir.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.893
Stand by for shallow pattern.

39:10.976 --> 39:12.728
Stand by for shallow pattern.
Aye, aye, sir!

39:12.811 --> 39:14.646
Sonar, sweep for contact
to starboard beam.

39:14.730 --> 39:16.940
Sonar, Bridge.
Sweep for contact to starboard beam.

39:19.109 --> 39:21.403
Bridge, Sonar. There's too many screws.
I can't hear anything.

39:21.486 --> 39:23.614
Sonar reports mixed signals, sir.
Too many propellers.

39:23.697 --> 39:25.449
-On my command, Mister Lopez.
-Aye, sir.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.953
Still too many screws.
Interference from the convoy.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.497
Sonar reports too many screws, sir.
Interference from the convoy.

39:45.844 --> 39:47.221
[garbled pinging]

39:47.304 --> 39:48.555
I got something.

39:56.146 --> 39:58.273
Got 'em. Contact close.
Starboard beam 083.

39:58.357 --> 40:00.484
Sonar reports contact close.
Starboard beam 083, sir.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.194
Correction, starboard beam 088, sir.

40:02.277 --> 40:03.320
Now, Mister Lopez!

40:03.403 --> 40:05.989
[Lopez] Fire, fire! Roll two, fire.
Port to starboard.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.623
[Ernie] Next pattern, Mister Lopez.

40:14.706 --> 40:15.749
Again, sir?

40:15.832 --> 40:17.292
Yes, again, Mister Lopez!

40:17.376 --> 40:20.838
All positions, fire when ready.
All positions, fire, fire!

40:20.921 --> 40:22.464
Helm, meet her! Head up the lane!

40:22.548 --> 40:25.175
[helmsman] Meet her.
Heading up the lane. Aye, aye, sir.

40:34.852 --> 40:35.894
[Ernie] Come on.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.314
-Sonar reports contact bearing--
-[sonarman] Correction.

40:39.398 --> 40:41.650
-Correction. Sonar reports...
-Questionable screw noises.

40:41.733 --> 40:43.318
...questionable screw noises.

40:44.069 --> 40:45.112
Contact stationary.

40:45.195 --> 40:46.822
Sonar reports contact stationary.

40:46.905 --> 40:47.990
Stationary?

40:48.657 --> 40:50.158
Sonar, Bridge. Anything further?

40:56.748 --> 40:58.584
Still stationary. Possible decoy.

40:58.667 --> 41:02.921
Sonar reports contact is not moving.
Possible decoy.

41:12.723 --> 41:13.974
[explosion]

41:17.186 --> 41:18.353
[Harbutt] The tanker, sir!

41:30.073 --> 41:33.869
[lookout] Survivors! Men in the water!
Port bow! Port bow!

41:33.952 --> 41:36.622
[talker] Contact.
Bearing starboard 538, 538.

41:36.705 --> 41:37.956
Distance 200 yards.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.459
-Mister Harbutt, who's your junior?
-Wallace, sir.

41:40.542 --> 41:41.835
Get him out here.

41:45.172 --> 41:47.508
[messenger]
Sir, a message from Cadena.

41:47.591 --> 41:48.592
Read it out.

41:48.675 --> 41:50.594
"Merchant ships vulnerable
at rear of convoy.

41:50.677 --> 41:52.888
Attack imminent.
Request your earliest assistance."

41:55.182 --> 41:58.769
Captain, survivors 500 yards starboard,
sir. Proceed with rescue?

42:06.860 --> 42:08.737
Get down to midships,
put down a scrambling net

42:08.820 --> 42:11.448
-and get those men out of the water.
-[Wallace] Aye, aye, sir.

42:11.532 --> 42:13.659
Stop engines. All slow astern.

42:14.409 --> 42:15.911
Mister Harbutt, you have the conn.

42:15.994 --> 42:18.705
Mind the debris and hail me
the moment Wallace has them aboard.

42:18.789 --> 42:20.123
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Signals?

42:20.207 --> 42:22.084
-Aye, sir.
-"Comescort to Cadena.

42:26.046 --> 42:27.673
Will assist as soon as possible."

42:28.215 --> 42:29.466
Aye, sir.

42:38.809 --> 42:40.561
[man] Give me your hand. Keep climbing.

42:41.103 --> 42:46.191
Krauts call it a Pillenwerfer, sir.
It's German for something.

42:46.275 --> 42:47.568
"Pill-thrower."

42:47.651 --> 42:49.736
-Yes, go on.
-Uh, I'd never heard of one before,

42:49.820 --> 42:54.032
but I got a buddy who was on the Kidd,
and he had one on his first crossing.

42:54.116 --> 42:57.077
It's a mechanical decoy
about the size of an icebox,

42:57.160 --> 42:59.204
and it shoots out gas
like an Alka-Seltzer.

42:59.288 --> 43:00.914
The krauts just drop it in the water,

43:00.998 --> 43:03.333
and it hangs there
while we waste depth charges on it.

43:04.001 --> 43:05.669
Detail it in your after-action report.

43:05.752 --> 43:08.130
Make sure all the other operators
are familiar with it.

43:08.213 --> 43:10.090
I-- I should've caught it sooner, sir.

43:11.550 --> 43:13.260
No, you did good work. Thank you.

43:13.343 --> 43:14.553
Sir. Aye, sir.

43:14.636 --> 43:16.471
[Charlie] You couldn't have known, Ernie.

43:20.350 --> 43:22.019
[Harbutt] Got 'em, sir. Four men.

43:22.102 --> 43:23.896
-Only four?
-All they could see or hear, sir.

43:23.979 --> 43:26.648
Okay. Head to rear of convoy.
Right hard rudder, hard over.

All ahead two-thirds.

43:27.858 --> 43:30.068

All ahead flank. Meet her
when we're headed down the lane.

43:40.287 --> 43:42.080
[helmsman]
All ahead flank. Aye, aye, sir.

43:51.423 --> 43:54.343
[Harbutt] That's the Southland, sir.
It's an American supply ship.

44:16.990 --> 44:18.450
Greyhound, Harry here.

44:18.534 --> 44:23.080
To confirm, targets remain at speed
just outside our perimeter.

44:23.747 --> 44:26.250
[Harbutt] Southland rescue completed.
Twenty-eight men rescued, sir.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.627
[man] Radar is back up, Captain.

44:28.710 --> 44:30.379
Left full rudder to 087.

44:30.462 --> 44:32.840
Take us up the right side of the convoy.
All ahead standard.

44:32.923 --> 44:34.633
[helmsman]
All ahead standard. Aye, aye, sir.

44:34.716 --> 44:36.677
Engine room answers
all ahead standard, sir.

44:37.803 --> 44:40.180
[radio: static]

44:40.264 --> 44:43.892
Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.

44:43.976 --> 44:45.561
This is Gray Wolf.

44:46.478 --> 44:52.359
We hunt you and your friends
Eagle, Dicky and Harry.

44:53.652 --> 44:56.905
We watch your ships sinking into the deep.

44:57.656 --> 45:02.119
We hear the screams of your comrades
as they die.

45:03.412 --> 45:07.583
How many of them will there be
before you join them?

45:09.334 --> 45:13.755
The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.

45:15.299 --> 45:17.843
-Your women will learn of your dying...
-Greyhound to all escorts.

45:17.926 --> 45:21.138
-...and weep into the long night before...
-Switch TBS traffic to channel Zebra.

45:21.221 --> 45:24.391
-...they turn to the arms of their lovers.
-Execute.

45:25.184 --> 45:29.563

46:04.306 --> 46:06.099

46:06.183 --> 46:08.393
Noted, thank you. Greyhound out.

46:08.977 --> 46:10.979

48:27.199 --> 48:30.369
Keep apprised of Eagle's target bearing
and notify me when we're two miles out.

48:30.452 --> 48:31.453
Aye, aye, sir.

48:36.875 --> 48:39.253
Sir, it's about the consumption
of depth charges.

48:39.336 --> 48:42.130
-Yes?
-Last pattern makes 32 cans fired.

48:44.925 --> 48:46.802
How many full patterns do we have left?

48:46.885 --> 48:48.011
None, sir.

48:49.179 --> 48:50.514
We're down to six charges.

48:53.016 --> 48:56.687
We pulled everything from below
last watch, if you recall, sir.

48:59.064 --> 49:01.650
Yes, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mister Flipper.

49:01.733 --> 49:03.652
It's Fippler, sir.

49:05.445 --> 49:09.157
Mister Fippler, we must leave off
the firing of full patterns.

49:09.616 --> 49:10.993
What I was gonna suggest, sir.

49:19.084 --> 49:23.172

49:25.257 --> 49:26.258
[radio: buzz]

49:28.135 --> 49:31.305
-Captain.
-I know it's risky, Charlie, but

49:31.388 --> 49:32.723
we need to break protocol.

49:32.806 --> 49:36.518
How soon can we reach air cover?
No more zigzags, no evasive maneuvers.

49:36.602 --> 49:37.603
Aye, aye, sir.

49:48.947 --> 49:49.948
[radio: buzz]

49:52.534 --> 49:53.368
Go, Charlie.

49:53.452 --> 49:55.704
We can be in range

49:55.787 --> 49:58.165
That's 0800
if we shift to a direct course, sir.

49:58.248 --> 49:59.082

50:08.842 --> 50:11.011
Took a header.
Gave me something more to do.

50:13.847 --> 50:15.933
-That for the captain?
-Yeah.

50:16.016 --> 50:19.019
Man hasn't had a bite to eat
or been off his feet since we left.

50:20.145 --> 50:23.232
[man] General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

50:23.982 --> 50:25.984
[Dicky] We're turning
to intercept at 16 knots, sir.

50:26.068 --> 50:28.070
-We'll do our best to hammer him.
-Understood, Dicky.

50:28.153 --> 50:29.446
Keep him under by all means.

50:29.530 --> 50:30.948
-Keep him under.
-Aye, sir.

50:32.533 --> 50:37.412
Combat, Conn. Keep a sharp eye out

-Left full rudder to 085.

51:22.165 --> 51:25.127

Can't submerge.

52:53.048 --> 52:54.883
Hard right rudder! Hard over!

52:56.468 --> 52:59.054
He's coming in close!
U-boat, starboard bow!

53:07.229 --> 53:10.148
[Watson] He's slipped in
under our guns, sir. We can't hit him!

53:10.232 --> 53:11.942

53:24.162 --> 53:26.582
Dicky's coming back in.

Dicky, Greyhound. What is your damage?

55:27.077 --> 55:29.997
Greyhound, our guns couldn't depress
far enough to do any damage.

55:30.080 --> 55:33.125
But, at 20 yards, the shells
went right through us without detonating.

55:33.208 --> 55:34.209
Are you seaworthy?

55:34.293 --> 55:36.086
All three hits
were well above the waterline, sir.

55:36.170 --> 55:38.380
We'll have our holes patched,
and we'll be back in the hunt.

55:38.463 --> 55:41.592

[doctor] I've got no room for corpses
down below, sir.

56:25.385 --> 56:26.720
Not with the four we pulled from Vasco.

56:26.803 --> 56:29.556
I can arrange for a service

looking for the general Resurrection
in their last day

at whose second coming
in glorious majesty to judge the world

We were hit forward of the engine room
and have a fire below deck.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.809
Some casualties.

01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:04.354
The Kong Gustav was hit first,
sank in three minutes.

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:05.689
We saw no survivors.

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:07.816
It's a bad afternoon, sir.

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:10.152
How seaworthy are you?

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:13.947
We have a five-degree list at starboard,
and we're down at the stern,

01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:16.074
but we'll tow all right up to five knots.

01:00:16.158 --> 01:00:18.911
We have a flap of plate sticking up,
scooping in the sea.

01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:21.163
The list gets worse if we make any speed.

01:00:22.414 --> 01:00:23.957
We must keep you afloat, Eagle.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.460
We'll do all the sea allows, sir.

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:29.671
Very well. Greyhound out.

01:00:57.241 --> 01:00:58.992
[Carling] I'm ready to relieve you, sir.

01:00:59.076 --> 01:01:01.370
[Harbutt] Very well.
We're steady on course 225.

01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:03.997
And we're at standard speed
with fuel conservation.

01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:05.582
[Carling] I relieve you, sir.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.461
[Harbutt] Sir?

01:01:10.295 --> 01:01:13.215
Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck and the conn.

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:14.758
Very well.

01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:18.846
Mister Carling,
Cadena has Eagle under tow at four knots.

01:01:18.929 --> 01:01:21.974
Continue circling.
We'll hold the screen at rear of convoy.

01:01:22.724 --> 01:01:24.935
Sonar, standard sweep to starboard.

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:27.771
Sonar, Bridge.
Search to starboard, standard pattern.

01:01:41.451 --> 01:01:43.996
Greyhound, Eagle. Greyhound, Eagle.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.127
Greyhound.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:52.379
Request permission to abandon ship, sir.

01:01:53.046 --> 01:01:55.090
The collision mats were not big enough.

01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:58.468
We have a 15-degree list now,
and the main deck is underwater.

01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:02.181
Well, I'm sure you've done all you could.
Permission granted.

01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:06.185
She's been a good home, sir.
It's been an honor sailing with you.

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.437
We'll be praying for you.
Godspeed, Captain.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.689
Thank you for a job well done.

01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:33.587
Thank you, Cleveland.

01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:35.631
I'm Pitts, sir.

01:02:36.632 --> 01:02:38.592
-Thank you.
-Sir.

01:02:52.814 --> 01:02:54.191
I need Mister Cole.

01:02:57.653 --> 01:03:00.364
[man] XO requested, bridge.
XO requested, bridge.

01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:05.869
You wanted to see me, skip?

01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:18.090
[Ernie] I've lost Eagle.

01:03:18.173 --> 01:03:22.636
Harry and Dicky are low on depth charges
and fuel, as are we.

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:25.764
I can offer only scant protection
to the convoy.

01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:28.350
We need air cover, Charlie.

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:31.228
Do--

01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:41.154
Do I break radio silence
with a message to the Admiralty?

01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:44.449
Or does that let the wolf pack know
just how vulnerable we are?

01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:45.909
What would the message be?

01:03:48.245 --> 01:03:49.329
"Help needed urgently."

01:03:50.163 --> 01:03:52.165
No. "Help needed." That means "urgently."

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.043
"Needed" isn't needed. Just "help."

01:03:55.127 --> 01:03:58.172
That's all the Admiralty needs to hear
for a modified rendezvous point.

01:03:58.255 --> 01:04:00.424
The Germans might miss a message
as short as that.

01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:04.678
I wouldn't need to take this risk
if I'd been smarter yesterday.

01:04:05.345 --> 01:04:07.723
What you did yesterday got us to today.

01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:11.602
It's not enough, Charlie.
Not nearly enough.

01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:26.575
Message from the Admiralty, sir.

01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:30.120
Some of it's badly scrambled, sir.
I've done my best with it.

01:04:32.247 --> 01:04:33.874
-XO to the bridge.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:36.710
What are these scrambles?

01:04:36.793 --> 01:04:39.838
I think coded numerals, sir.
But I'm sure of that.

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:42.508
"Expect aircraft.

01:04:42.591 --> 01:04:45.177
His challenge, 'Uncle William.'
Your answer, 'Baker Dog.'"

01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:47.596
[Charlie] Captain?

01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:49.806
Charlie. Message from Admiralty.

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.600
Reinforcements dispatched.

01:04:53.185 --> 01:04:54.728
But it's only partially deciphered.

01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:56.271
Put together a team,
see what else is there.

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.356
Aye, aye, sir.

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:17.584
[radio: static]

01:05:17.668 --> 01:05:19.127
[Gray Wolf, on radio] Greyhound!

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:23.715
Your flock is not safe from this wolf.

01:05:24.967 --> 01:05:28.262
We can always find you
in the night to kill you.

01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:29.346
Escorts, Greyhound.

01:05:29.429 --> 01:05:31.932
-Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?
-Divert all further TBS traffic

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:33.475
to channel Hotel. Execute.

01:05:33.559 --> 01:05:35.310
[Gray Wolf howls]

01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:37.729
Thought these were numerals,
but it was "Point X-ray."

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:39.940
"Modify rendezvous point to Point X-ray."

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:42.609
-Mm-hmm. How soon?
-Something like four hours, skip.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:45.070
Sir.

01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:21.356
-[Ernie] Messenger.
-Yes, sir.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.277
Go to my cabin and bring me my slippers.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.361
Aye, sir.

01:06:30.324 --> 01:06:31.867
[grunts]

01:06:45.672 --> 01:06:47.758
Ah, thank you. Return those.

01:06:49.801 --> 01:06:51.261
[grunts]

01:06:58.602 --> 01:06:59.603
Ah.

01:07:00.771 --> 01:07:01.897
[exhales]

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:04.691
[radarman] I've got two contacts
bearing 099...

01:07:04.775 --> 01:07:07.402
[talker] Combat reports two pips,
starboard bow. Bearing 099.

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:08.862
The other at 168, sir.

01:07:08.946 --> 01:07:11.323
-Boatswain, take us to white.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:14.785
Charlie, these pips.

01:07:15.327 --> 01:07:17.996
Yes, sir, we got two skunks
showing on surface radar.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.540
They're heading straight for us.

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:22.501
Just two hours to the rendezvous point,
Ernie, God willin'.

01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:30.759
All escorts, Greyhound. I have
two surface targets off to starboard.

01:07:30.843 --> 01:07:32.511
Maintain your screens.

01:07:33.679 --> 01:07:35.931
Mister Watson,
bring us up to general quarters.

01:07:36.014 --> 01:07:38.433
-[Watson] General quarters.
-[man] Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:38.517 --> 01:07:41.186
General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:43.897
[Ernie] Harry, Dicky. Greyhound.
I am engaging targets.

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:46.441
[Dicky] Request permission to come down
there and bounce 'em with you, sir.

01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:48.861
-Negative, Dicky. Maintain your screen.
-Aye, sir.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.030
-Messenger.
-Sir.

01:07:54.032 --> 01:07:55.367
I'd like more coffee, please.

01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:57.286
Aye, sir.

01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:06.587
[garbled radio transmission]

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:07.838
[Gray Wolf] Greyhound.

01:08:08.547 --> 01:08:10.549
Guten Morgen, Greyhound.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:15.429
Did you think you had slipped away
from this Gray Wolf?

01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:19.765
No, you did not. You will not.

01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:24.770
The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:27.399
not the hound on the run.

01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:31.819
You and your comrades will die today.

01:08:32.404 --> 01:08:33.404
[Charlie] Conn, Combat.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:35.908
-Radar showing contact at 110.
-[lookout] Periscope to starboard bow.

01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:38.785
Range is 2,100 yards and closing, sir.

01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.120
[lookout] About one mile!

01:08:40.871 --> 01:08:42.287
-There, sir!
-[Lopez] Fire!

01:08:46.835 --> 01:08:48.462
The wake, sir! There!

01:08:54.343 --> 01:08:55.426
Contact 187...

01:08:55.511 --> 01:08:58.970
Sonar reports torpedoes, starboard beam,
bearing 187. Range 1,500, sir.

01:09:00.682 --> 01:09:02.684
-Left full rudder.
-[Watson] Left full rudder.

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:18.575
Second torpedo to starboard beam!

-Right hard rudder, hard over!
-Right hard rudder, hard over!

01:09:29.795 --> 01:09:31.880
Belay that, belay that!
Meet her. Meet her!

01:09:31.964 --> 01:09:33.215
Belay. Meet her. Meet her.

01:09:33.298 --> 01:09:34.883
[helmsman] Aye, sir. Holding course.

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:54.444
[Ernie] Right hard rudder, hard over!

01:09:54.528 --> 01:09:56.947
Starboard slow astern! Port ahead full!

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.032
[Watson] Starboard slow astern!
Port ahead full!

01:10:14.965 --> 01:10:16.758
[Ernie] All hands, brace for collision!

01:10:32.983 --> 01:10:35.402
Meet her! Steer straight
for that pip at 119!

01:10:35.485 --> 01:10:36.904
-119. Aye, aye, sir.
-All ahead full.

01:10:36.987 --> 01:10:39.865
-All ahead full. Aye, aye, sir.
-We'll ram that U-boat if we have to!

01:10:40.449 --> 01:10:42.868
[cannons firing]

01:10:59.426 --> 01:11:01.094
[lookout] Torpedo off starboard bow!

01:11:01.178 --> 01:11:03.680
-Bring us full left to 100.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:11:22.866 --> 01:11:24.993
Conning tower, dead ahead!

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.206
[Watson] We must have hit her!

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:34.378
Charlie! Lay a course to open the arcs
of fire aft! We'll hit 'em broadside!

01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:37.798
Left full rudder, slow to two-thirds.
After batteries, fire as you bear.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.763
All mounts, local control!

01:11:44.847 --> 01:11:47.140
-Target will be fine on our starboard bow!
-[repeating command]

01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:48.642
Fire as they bear!

01:11:48.725 --> 01:11:51.728
[Lopez] Weapons, Bridge. All mounts,
local control. Fire as they bear.

01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:18.130
[lookout] Second sub spotted!
Periscope, starboard bow!

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:23.218
[lookout] He's got us lined up, sir!

01:12:23.844 --> 01:12:26.597
All mounts, local control!
Get those guns around!

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:33.395
[lookout 2] Air cover! Air cover!

01:12:33.478 --> 01:12:34.813
[airplane propellers whirring]

01:12:35.314 --> 01:12:37.608
Signal Bridge reports aircraft signals.
"Uncle William," sir.

01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:39.109
Reply, "Baker Dog."

01:12:39.902 --> 01:12:41.320
Right standard rudder!

01:12:41.403 --> 01:12:42.988
Mounts 41 and 42,

01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:45.240
open fire to mark the target
for that aircraft!

01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:47.159
[talker] ...mark target for that aircraft.

01:13:13.393 --> 01:13:16.855
[crew cheering]

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.525
Good work.

01:13:20.817 --> 01:13:22.986
[crew continues cheering]

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:42.631
[Watson] Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck.

01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:44.258
Very well.

01:13:45.717 --> 01:13:46.802
Messenger.

01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:50.222
-Yes, sir.
-Write this.

01:13:51.014 --> 01:13:53.475
"To Comconvoy and all escorts:

01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:58.647
Sonar reports no contacts.
Radar reports no contacts.

01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:01.775
All escorts, resume station."

01:14:02.776 --> 01:14:03.777
-Send it.
-Aye, sir.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:09.658
[helmsman] My heading is 290, sir.

01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:12.244
-[Carling] Very well. Steady as she goes.
-[helmsman] Steady as she goes, sir.

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:14.872
-[Carling] All ahead standard.
-[helmsman] All ahead standard. Aye, sir.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.636
[talker] Forward Lookout reports ship
starboard bow.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.889
Bearing 110. Range eight miles.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.648
-Message, sir.
-Read it out.

01:14:41.732 --> 01:14:43.734
"Admiralty to Greyhound. Welcome.

01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:46.445
Kindly make verbal report
to Diamond on TBS."

01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:56.288
Diamond, Greyhound. Diamond, Greyhound.
Do you hear me?

01:14:56.872 --> 01:15:00.459
Loud and clear, Greyhound.
We hear you had a bit of a rough go of it.

01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:03.712
Yes, sir. In the last 48 hours,

01:15:03.795 --> 01:15:08.258
we've lost seven ships from the convoy.
Two others were damaged.

01:15:08.717 --> 01:15:11.345
And the condition of your command?
How are you holding up?

01:15:11.428 --> 01:15:14.723
I took a round from a sub
on our portside deck. Three were killed.

01:15:14.806 --> 01:15:16.099
But you are seaworthy?

01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:20.103
Yes, sir. Dicky and I fought him
out on the surface, and we got him.

01:15:20.187 --> 01:15:22.564
Uh, my escort group sank three others.

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:25.859
Four U-boats? [laughs]
Bloody good job, Greyhound.

01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:31.031
We will be relieving you now
and taking the convoy on to Liverpool.

01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:32.449
You take Dicky and Harry

01:15:32.533 --> 01:15:34.826
and make best speed
to the naval yard in Londonderry.

01:15:36.662 --> 01:15:41.834
Sir, I request I stay with the convoy.
I have 56 hours fuel at economical speed.

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:45.838
No, that's an order, Commander.
We'll see the convoy on from here.

01:15:45.921 --> 01:15:47.840
I need you to take Dicky and Harry
back home.

01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:51.051
They're not fit to stay in the game,
understood? Off to Derry with you.

01:15:51.134 --> 01:15:52.135
Aye, aye, sir.

01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:55.472
Tell me, Greyhound, just curious,

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:57.683
how many crossings
does that make for you now?

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:00.269
This was my first, sir.

01:16:00.352 --> 01:16:02.437
[chuckles] Unbelievable.

01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:05.691
Well, let's hope next time's a bit easier,
eh? Admirable show, Commander.

01:16:25.127 --> 01:16:26.962
You are relieved of your screening duties.

01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:30.007
Form starboard echelon on me
at the head of the convoy.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:33.510

-Signal Bridge. Send it.
-Signal Bridge. Aye, sir.

01:17:07.628 --> 01:17:10.297
Commodore is signaling
five minutes to course change, Captain.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.549
Very well. Take us up the lane.

01:17:12.633 --> 01:17:14.968

turn right to 087.

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:25.479
[helmsman]
Steady as I go. Aye, sir.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.582
Mister Carling, she's all yours.

01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:49.211
I will be in my cabin if you need me.

01:17:50.379 --> 01:17:51.380
Aye, aye, sir.

01:18:10.399 --> 01:18:12.568

01:18:40.053 --> 01:18:42.181
[cheering continues]

01:19:10.667 --> 01:19:13.420
[cheering, shouting]

01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:34.710
"I thank you, my heavenly Father,

01:20:34.793 --> 01:20:36.670
that you have graciously kept me this day.

01:20:36.753 --> 01:20:40.340
Into your hands I commend myself,
my body and soul. Amen."
