No, man, I'm celebrity
murderer Phil Spector.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.985
I show up to court like this.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.920
Ooh!

10:21.922 --> 10:24.356
And that's a lot tougher
than a leprechaun.

10:24.358 --> 10:25.357
Leprechaun?!

10:25.359 --> 10:28.259
I am the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish,

10:28.261 --> 10:31.663
the most fearless of
all collegiate mascots.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.665
(doorbell rings)

10:33.667 --> 10:34.833
Trick or...
Trout!

10:34.835 --> 10:36.334
Go fish.
(chuckles)

10:36.336 --> 10:38.603
Wait, we don't want fish,
we want candy.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.271
Unless they're
Swedish fish.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.273
"Horgy borgy bork bork bork."

10:42.275 --> 10:43.274
(groans)

10:43.276 --> 10:44.376
Annoying much?!

10:44.378 --> 10:46.511
No candy for anyone!

10:46.513 --> 10:51.282
Daddy, your Robin Williams-esque
friend is ruining Halloween.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.150
Yeah, Brown.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.019
Too scared
to shut this chump up?

10:54.021 --> 10:55.120
Hardly.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.321
Donny, get lost.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.989
Take a hike.

11:00.459 --> 11:01.593
See that?

11:01.595 --> 11:02.594
Fearless.

11:02.596 --> 11:03.595
Oh, yeah?

11:03.597 --> 11:05.430
Watch what I'm not afraid to do!

11:05.432 --> 11:06.631
(horns blaring)

11:06.633 --> 11:08.366
Wa-wa-wa-wah-wah-
wah-wah-wah-wah!

11:08.368 --> 11:10.201
Rallo!

11:10.203 --> 11:12.370
(electrical zapping)

11:12.372 --> 11:14.673
Ha! You only made
it halfway.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.341
Watch this.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.308
Wa-wa-wa-wah...

11:17.310 --> 11:18.977
(horn blaring)
That's it!

11:18.979 --> 11:21.112
I had my tubes tied
for a reason.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.515
I don't want to be raising
any more babies!

11:23.517 --> 11:24.516
But...

11:24.518 --> 11:25.583
We're done.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.352
No more trick-or-treating!

11:27.354 --> 11:30.622
I'll just buy candy.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.891
BOTH (garbled):
Ow! Ow!

11:38.497 --> 11:40.165
Hey, Edwin,

11:40.167 --> 11:44.169
I know your vampire senses can
pick up that I'm in danger.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.539
Uh-oh,
I'm falling off this cliff.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.207
You better save me!

11:49.209 --> 11:50.408
(inhales)

11:54.013 --> 11:55.280
Help, Edwin!

11:55.282 --> 11:56.448
I am drowning!

11:56.450 --> 11:59.451
Come save me, my belove...

12:01.420 --> 12:04.255
(gasps)
Who are you?

12:04.257 --> 12:07.358
I'm Caleb. And you are lucky
I was out here taking a dip

12:07.360 --> 12:09.060
under the full moon, missy.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.631
Full moon?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.100
(gasps)

12:15.102 --> 12:20.371
Now I have to decide between
a vampire and a werewolf!

12:20.373 --> 12:24.109
The movies say this is how
to get a boyfriend...!

12:29.515 --> 12:32.250
Why are we driving through
this spooky neighborhood?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.186
We buying another
foreclosure?

12:38.524 --> 12:41.292
Isn't this
the old McCafferty place?

12:41.294 --> 12:43.361
As in, "I dare you
to ride your bike up

12:43.363 --> 12:45.196
to the old McCafferty place"?

12:45.198 --> 12:47.932
Yes, because it's time
to end your silly rivalry.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.601
You're both going
to prove you're brave

12:49.603 --> 12:51.669
by getting through the
scariest night of the year

12:51.671 --> 12:53.304
in the scariest
house in town.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.806
Hop out, tough guys!

12:54.808 --> 12:56.508
Time to grow up.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.443
(Rallo grumbles)

13:00.646 --> 13:03.381
See you in the morning...

13:03.383 --> 13:04.916
if you survive!

13:04.918 --> 13:07.619
(maniacal laughter)

13:07.621 --> 13:10.688
Yeah, then maybe
we'll all get brunch!

13:10.690 --> 13:13.324
(maniacal laughter)

13:13.326 --> 13:15.193
(tires squeal)

13:18.964 --> 13:20.198
(door creaks)

13:33.012 --> 13:35.180
It, it's nice.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.314
I don't know.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.917
Seems a little
<i>Scooby-Doo</i> to me.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.418
Zoinks!

13:40.420 --> 13:42.787
(laughs a la Scooby-Do)

13:42.789 --> 13:45.156
See, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.293
(thunder crashes)

13:48.295 --> 13:52.163
You blew me off
one too many times, Cleveland.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.533
Who's hacky now? (laughs)

13:55.535 --> 13:58.002
Still me.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.075
(running footsteps)

14:05.878 --> 14:07.512
(door slams)

14:08.480 --> 14:10.381
Well, good death, Rallo.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.683
I mean, good night.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.652
See you in heaven.
I mean, in the morning.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.855
(stairs creaking)

14:18.924 --> 14:20.758
Well, I won't be
able to sleep

14:20.760 --> 14:23.962
till you go find out
what that noise is.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.830
Fine, I'll go.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.532
But you get nothing for
Christmas ever again.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.766
You're bluffing.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.201
Dang!

14:30.203 --> 14:33.004
You know how I cherish
the smile on a child's face

14:33.006 --> 14:35.440
on Christmas morn.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.214
Man, if I were
watching this,

14:43.216 --> 14:46.050
I'd be yelling at myself
to get the hell out of here.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.226
BOTH:
Ah...!

14:56.262 --> 14:58.263
(both laugh)

14:58.265 --> 15:00.265
Nice work, Miss Donna!

15:00.267 --> 15:02.867
A sound-effects CD
and a rubber spider,

15:02.869 --> 15:05.803
and they're shaking
like a couple of bitches.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.038
(laughs)

15:07.040 --> 15:10.775
Well, thank you for
hooking up the Webcam!

15:10.777 --> 15:12.610
I hope you never
abandon me

15:12.612 --> 15:15.313
in an emotionally scarring
location to prove a point.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.315
Well, just don't cross me,
Junior.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.284
(Cleveland screams)

15:19.286 --> 15:21.819
(laughs)
Tonight's gonna be fun!

15:21.821 --> 15:23.087
(door creaks)

15:23.089 --> 15:26.257
(laughs)
Yes!

15:26.259 --> 15:27.926
Yes, it is.

15:27.928 --> 15:31.296
ANNOUNCER:
<i>When we return,</i>
<i>Cleveland Jr. dies,</i>

15:31.298 --> 15:34.332
<i>but Donna lives,</i>
<i>and she and Cleveland begin</i>

15:34.334 --> 15:36.301
<i>the painful process</i>
<i>of starting anew</i>

15:36.303 --> 15:38.336
<i>when</i> The Cleveland Show

15:38.338 --> 15:41.272
Halloween ExtravaGHOULza
<i>continues!</i>

15:44.677 --> 15:46.678
(wolf howls)

15:46.680 --> 15:48.680
(thunder crashes)

15:48.682 --> 15:52.417
(wolf coughs, clears throat,
resumes howling)

15:55.087 --> 15:56.120
(door creaks)

15:56.122 --> 15:58.356
Wait, Rallo, I think

15:58.358 --> 16:00.325
I see a g-g-g-g-

16:00.327 --> 16:01.592
guest room!

16:02.461 --> 16:04.329
Let's go sleep in there.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.164
Yeah, go in there!

16:06.166 --> 16:07.966
CLEVELAND (screams):
<i>Walking Dead</i> night-light!

16:07.968 --> 16:10.201
(door creaks)

16:11.503 --> 16:13.471
(Donna screams)

16:13.473 --> 16:17.375
Here's... Donny! Yah!

16:17.377 --> 16:19.210
I'm sorry. Is Cleveland home?
No.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.646
Oh, what the hell.
I'll just kill you!

16:21.648 --> 16:23.147
Yah...!

16:23.149 --> 16:24.916
(both gasp)

16:26.752 --> 16:29.754
(screams intermittently)

16:31.256 --> 16:33.358
(screams)

16:33.360 --> 16:34.525
Yah!

16:34.527 --> 16:35.593
(maniacal laughter)

16:35.595 --> 16:37.695
(screams)

16:37.697 --> 16:38.696
(thunder crashes)

16:38.698 --> 16:40.064
(both scream)

16:41.133 --> 16:42.934
Aw, who are we kidding?

16:42.936 --> 16:44.135
All right, on three,

16:44.137 --> 16:46.437
let's say exactly what
we want to do right now.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.539
One, two, three!

16:48.541 --> 16:52.043
BOTH:
I want to get the hell out of
here, go home, order a pizza,

16:52.045 --> 16:53.945
watch <i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i>
<i>and go to bed.</i>

16:53.947 --> 16:55.380
Me, too!
Me, too!

16:55.382 --> 16:57.148
But we can't go home now.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.449
You're right.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.285
Your mom and Junior will tease
the dickens out of us.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.621
Can we say that?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.256
Oh, okay.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.191
They'll tease
the dickens out of us.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.594
Ow, right in
the dickens!

17:12.264 --> 17:14.232
(shrieks)

17:14.933 --> 17:15.933
(gasps)

17:17.503 --> 17:20.271
(gasping)

17:20.273 --> 17:21.305
You get a haircut?

17:21.307 --> 17:23.207
No, I got 'em all cut!

17:23.209 --> 17:25.143
(crazy laughter)

17:25.145 --> 17:28.112
Leave Miss Donna alone,
crazy comedy man!

17:28.114 --> 17:30.014
(shrieking)
(grunting)

17:31.850 --> 17:34.018
You know, you can't
really blame Tiger

17:34.020 --> 17:36.020
for wanting to spice
things up a little.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.823
Still, there could've
been one black woman.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.258
Look at us.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.293
Stalling with
semi-topical small talk

17:42.295 --> 17:44.162
because we're
afraid to go home.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.363
You're right.

17:45.365 --> 17:48.800
Let's at least be brave
about being cowards.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.269
Hard-to-place ethnic,
take us home!

17:51.271 --> 17:54.105
Hey, I yem fram Flatka.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.507
I once drive Kate Hudson.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.709
Pee-ew!

18:08.153 --> 18:10.354
It's so hard
having a vampire

18:10.356 --> 18:13.091
and a werewolf in love
with you, you know?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.192
Look at the two
of them,

18:14.194 --> 18:16.861
eyeing each other
across the room, mouthing

18:16.863 --> 18:18.763
"I want to fight
you so hard."

18:18.765 --> 18:21.199
I can't take it anymore!

18:23.001 --> 18:26.204
Ew! Your boob totally
mushed my elbow!

18:26.206 --> 18:27.538
(sarcastic):
Oh, good, she's back.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.173
Look, we're just gonna have

18:29.175 --> 18:32.043
to settle this like I assume
they did in <i>Twilight: Eclipse.</i>

18:32.045 --> 18:34.312
I missed that part because I was
in a screaming match

18:34.314 --> 18:36.714
with an old lady who told me
to get off my phone.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.350
Anyway, you two have
to fight over me.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.152
Winner takes Roberta.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.687
But neither of us wants...

18:42.689 --> 18:44.622
To lose me, I know!

18:44.624 --> 18:47.225
But this is how it has to be.

18:50.162 --> 18:52.363
Oh, I can't stand
to watch them fight.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.365
Anna, tell me who's winning.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.136
Uh, they're not fighting.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.271
But the werewolf
is on top.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.674
(gasps)
Oh, my God, the werewolf

19:03.676 --> 19:05.977
and vampire are gay!

19:05.979 --> 19:07.879
News flash!

19:07.881 --> 19:09.280
You know, Roberta,
for the record,

19:09.282 --> 19:11.616
most gay people
are not monsters.

19:11.618 --> 19:15.419
(lisping):
But most monsters are gay!

19:15.421 --> 19:17.255
(makes sizzling sound)

19:20.325 --> 19:23.227
Well, we couldn't make it
through the night.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.834
Oh, hey, Donna.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.538
All right, let fly
the jabs and japes.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.873
(laughs)

19:35.875 --> 19:38.176
Sorry to be such a drag!

19:38.178 --> 19:39.544
(laughs)

19:39.546 --> 19:41.212
Hi, Daddy.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.346
What the hell?!

19:42.348 --> 19:43.581
(Rallo screams)

19:45.584 --> 19:50.021
Time for my axe to make
your body spray blood.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.323
(chuckles)
"Axe Body Spray"?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.325
I don't know
what that is.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.194
Something the kids are using!

19:56.196 --> 19:57.828
Yah!

19:57.830 --> 19:59.230
(yells)

20:00.999 --> 20:02.033
(yelling continues)

20:02.035 --> 20:03.768
(Cleveland grunting)

20:15.347 --> 20:19.350
I... hate... black people...!

20:19.352 --> 20:20.318
(thud)

20:20.320 --> 20:21.852
Figures.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.791
So, your husband
and five-year-old son

20:26.793 --> 20:27.992
just killed a guy.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.927
Pretty brave, huh?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.028
I was right.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.297
Tonight <i>was</i> a pretty good night.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.099
(Auto-Tuned):
♪ I gotta feeling

20:35.101 --> 20:37.001
