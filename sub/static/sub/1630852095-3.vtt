WEBVTT

00:04.958 --> 00:06.000
Come on!

00:06.083 --> 00:07.125
You're Hawkeye!

00:09.541 --> 00:11.541
I love you, Dad.

00:11.625 --> 00:13.250
I love you more.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.333
Call me when you get home? I love you.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.750
<i>Armand Duquesne</i>
<i>was found dead in his home last night.</i>

00:18.833 --> 00:20.958
-Yeah.
<i>-These two events have officials wondering</i>

00:21.041 --> 00:24.791
<i>if indeed, the Ronin has returned</i>
<i>to New York City and what he may do next.</i>

00:27.208 --> 00:29.083
Jack is hiding something, Mom.

00:29.166 --> 00:32.958
Don't you think it's a little strange that
the same night his uncle threatens you,

00:33.041 --> 00:35.375
<i>he ends up murdered by sword?</i>

00:36.333 --> 00:39.500
-Kate Bishop is guy in costume.
-Who are you talking about?

00:45.833 --> 00:48.041
We have them...

01:30.375 --> 01:31.625
And listen.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.125
Hey!

03:05.500 --> 03:07.041
It's quiet like you.

03:19.416 --> 03:22.416
Um, no. Maybe they are,

03:22.500 --> 03:26.166
but dragons live in a different world.

03:34.708 --> 03:39.625
Well, that would make them stronger.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.125
It's impossible.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.791
See, you are one of a kind.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.750
I'm sorry.

04:04.291 --> 04:07.833
But in the end, it'll be better for you.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.333
No.

04:16.208 --> 04:22.958
You have to learn
to jump between two worlds.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.041
Just by watching.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.791
All right, class. Water break.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.458
Hey, be good in class today.

04:57.333 --> 05:03.041
But remember, for your match,
it's more about speed than size.

05:04.916 --> 05:08.000
Hmm? Uncle will take you home after class.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.458
I'll see you tonight.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.125
Maya, you're up.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.000
And bow.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.083
Ready?

05:34.291 --> 05:35.333
Fight!

07:54.416 --> 07:56.041
You're like a pony, Hawkeye.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.875
Just keep going,
and going, and going. I love it.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.083
I love it, bro. Look at Hawkeye!

08:02.166 --> 08:04.666
-MAN 2: Where's your arrows now?
-MAN 1: Pew, pew.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.291
Big, strong Hawkeye riding prony.

08:07.375 --> 08:10.541
They should smile more.
This is fun for us too, you know.

08:11.541 --> 08:13.333
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

08:13.416 --> 08:15.958
-MAN 3: Again. Enrique, again, come on.
-Great.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.083
-MAN 2: Go get more quarters.
-Yes.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.625
This is boring. Dmitri, let's play cards.

08:23.875 --> 08:25.500
Seems like you're mad at me.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.333
I know it doesn't look like that,

08:28.416 --> 08:30.500
but you'd be lost without me,
you realize that?

08:30.583 --> 08:33.250
I was about
to clear your name from the suit,

08:33.333 --> 08:36.125
until you decided
to crash through the skylight.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.750
-Oh.
-Yeah.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.166
-Bro!
<i>-Cálmate,</i> bro. <i>Cálmate.</i>

08:46.125 --> 08:47.416
You good?

08:51.583 --> 08:55.208
I buy Imagine Dragons tickets
for my girlfriend,

08:55.291 --> 08:59.000
as, like, early Christmas gift, right?

08:59.083 --> 09:01.458
-Mmm. That's so sweet.
-Good, sweet.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.250
Then we had fight.
You know what she said?

09:03.333 --> 09:07.166
She said that the tickets were gift,
so she wants to bring her sister.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.791
I mean, look on the bright side.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.000
You don't have to go see Imagine Dragons.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.166
I love Imagine Dragons.

09:14.666 --> 09:18.833
Uh, she doesn't even like them, you know.
She did this on purpose to hurt me.

09:18.916 --> 09:21.208
Look, I think you both owe apologies.

09:21.291 --> 09:22.625
Tell her she hurt your feelings,

09:22.708 --> 09:25.375
but apologize for pretending
that that was a gift for her.

09:25.458 --> 09:29.041
Okay, wait, I need a pen.
Just... Okay, okay? See you.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.208
Hmm. See? A little trust,

09:34.416 --> 09:37.416
a little communicating,
a little listening...

09:38.166 --> 09:40.125
-What?
-KATE: Basic human stuff.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.583
-You know what I think?
-You know what I think? Hmm?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.625
I think you talk too much.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.166
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.291
She always like this?

09:50.166 --> 09:53.708
Maybe I rip out your throat. Hmm?

09:56.750 --> 09:58.916
Or maybe she will.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.041
Who is she?

10:23.333 --> 10:24.416
Thank you.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.750
Oh, uh, yeah. Sorry.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.041
Hard of hearing, not deaf.

10:34.875 --> 10:35.875
Oh, boy.

10:38.916 --> 10:41.708
More cookie, please. Thank you.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.375
Uh...

10:49.500 --> 10:51.333
Right, well, it's nice talking to you.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.083
She asked
what you're doing here, Clint Barton.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.333
-Riding a unicorn.
-Learning about trust.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.708
"You rely too much on technology."

11:03.791 --> 11:07.875
Well, my go-to weapon
is two sticks and a string, so...

11:08.666 --> 11:10.791
-KAZI: No, she means your hearing aid.
-BARTON: Ah.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.958
"You might find
you're better off without it."

11:13.833 --> 11:16.041
Yeah, sometimes
I think that very same thing.

11:17.916 --> 11:18.916
Now, the suit.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.958
She put it on by accident.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.666
She didn't know what it means.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.125
She's not Ronin.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.083
Look at her. She's nine.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.333
And spoiled rotten.

11:30.541 --> 11:32.333
"She beat up a few of my guys

11:32.416 --> 11:34.750
"and then came running
when you were in trouble.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.541
"Seems like she's got
something to do with it.

11:36.625 --> 11:41.166
"And just because she's not the Ronin
doesn't mean that Ronin's not back."

11:42.875 --> 11:44.208
That's just a rumor.

11:44.291 --> 11:45.833
"How do you know?"

11:47.833 --> 11:49.083
Because he's dead.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.666
"So, who got him, then?"

12:00.375 --> 12:03.041
"So Ronin is dead,
and the person who killed him is dead.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.208
"That's convenient. How do you know this?"

12:06.375 --> 12:07.500
'Cause I was there.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.041
"You're lying."

12:11.666 --> 12:14.708
Okay, clearly this isn't working. Um...

12:16.208 --> 12:17.791
If you have nothing to do with this,

12:17.875 --> 12:20.958
then why did you put on this suit
in the first place?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.416
-KAZI: Maya, no.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.916
Oh, God. I put that suit on
because I didn't want

12:34.000 --> 12:36.125
anybody to know
that I was at the auction, okay?

12:36.208 --> 12:38.541
I didn't know
what it was when I put it on, I swear.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.375
I swear.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.458
-What are you doing?

12:43.666 --> 12:46.041
-Doesn't matter, okay?
-BARTON: Listen to me.

12:46.791 --> 12:50.291
Listen. No, now's not
the time to be scared.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.666
We're gonna get out of this.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.291
You go back to living your life,
I'll go back to my family.

12:54.375 --> 12:57.250
You're gonna harness
that over-confidence of yours, okay?

12:57.333 --> 13:00.625
This ridiculous over-confidence,
you remember that one?

13:00.708 --> 13:03.041
Okay? So wait for my signal.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.666
-You should...
-KATE: How did you do that? Clint!

13:07.750 --> 13:09.708
Go help Maya, all right?

13:10.583 --> 13:12.750
Bring him back alive.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.833
Damn it!

13:13.916 --> 13:16.291
Oh, man, it'd be really nice to know
how you did that, Clint.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.750
Clint?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.500
Hawkeye, come out and play.

13:34.958 --> 13:36.708
Come out and play.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.125
Look over there. Spread out.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.750
Don't shoot!
They want him alive, you idiot!

14:51.250 --> 14:52.666
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:53.291 --> 14:54.750
You're not going anywhere.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.708
I was doing fine.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.250
Okay.

16:27.916 --> 16:29.333
My hearing aid's smashed.

16:29.416 --> 16:30.541
Come on, we gotta go.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.250
But that girl still has my bow.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.583
We need a car.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.250
Oh, can we take this one?

16:37.333 --> 16:39.125
Man, this thing's beautiful.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.291
I'm not smashin' a '72 Challenger.
Come on.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.000
Youth.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.083
Let's go.

16:51.541 --> 16:52.541
Yes, boss.

16:54.916 --> 16:56.666
Hey, get over here, I need you to drive.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.250
-What? I don't know how to drive.
-Come over here.

16:59.333 --> 17:02.708
No, you, you drive. I shoot.

17:03.208 --> 17:06.041
I'm not hearing you. You drive, okay?

17:10.833 --> 17:12.250
Come on. Come on!

17:13.041 --> 17:14.708
-KAZI: Ivan, come with me.
-Let's go, let's go!

17:14.791 --> 17:16.375
Tomás, go with Maya.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.458
-MAN 1: Watch out!
-MAN 2: Go, go!

17:21.541 --> 17:23.291
Let's go! Let's go!

17:29.125 --> 17:31.458
-BARTON: How many we got?
-Four!

17:37.166 --> 17:40.250
Yo, get in front of 'em!
Get in front of 'em!

17:44.083 --> 17:45.750
-BARTON: Hang on.

17:59.666 --> 18:02.916
Wait, wait, wait.
We're out of the regular arrows.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.458
What do you mean, we're...
Oh, my God, trick arrows?

18:05.541 --> 18:07.041
Definitely not this one...

18:07.125 --> 18:09.166
-Don't say definitely like that.
-Not this one.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.000
-This is too dangerous.
-This one fine?

18:11.083 --> 18:13.333
-I'm using this one.
-Hey, be careful.

18:13.416 --> 18:15.875
-I was born careful.
-They're not regular arrows.

18:15.958 --> 18:16.958
Kate.

18:21.083 --> 18:24.375
-KATE: Eenie, meenie, miney...
-Got you. Come on, come on.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.416
Mo.

18:27.416 --> 18:28.583
It's growing.

18:29.333 --> 18:30.541
Play-Doh arrow?

18:30.625 --> 18:31.666
-Put wiper.
-Come on.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.208
Ugh! I can't see nothing!

18:34.583 --> 18:36.583
Hit their wheels with the putty arrow.

18:36.666 --> 18:40.125
Oh. Great idea. I'll do that as soon
as you label these damn things.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.958
This'd be a lot easier
if we were facing...

18:48.041 --> 18:50.000
It'd be easier
if we were facing the other way.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.833
Yeah, just a... Hey, we're communicating!

18:52.916 --> 18:54.458
Hang on.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.041
Holy...

19:18.458 --> 19:20.750
There are four arrows
more dangerous than that one?

19:36.458 --> 19:39.750
A plunger arrow? What is the trick?
That it's completely useless?

19:51.125 --> 19:52.500
-Look out!
-Watch it, moron!

19:52.583 --> 19:53.750
Merry Christmas!

19:58.541 --> 20:00.541
Please be a good one.
Please be a good one.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.875
What the hell is that one called?

20:13.458 --> 20:15.000
-Sorry, Santa.

20:20.291 --> 20:21.458
Kate.

20:22.291 --> 20:24.000
Here, acid arrows.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.291
Drop the stoplights.

20:56.791 --> 20:58.458
Kate, get in!

21:13.250 --> 21:14.416
I'll take that, thank you.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.541
And the Challenger
gets totaled anyway.

21:38.666 --> 21:40.750
Now I really can't see. Thank you.

21:41.541 --> 21:43.125
-Wait. Hang on, hang on.

21:54.833 --> 21:55.875
What is he doing?

21:56.333 --> 21:57.625
He's gonna crash into us.

22:01.708 --> 22:03.416
Here, take out that truck.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.041
Aim high. Bring the arrow down on him.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.583
What's the plan?
This is just a normal arrow.

22:08.666 --> 22:12.291
I have no idea what you're saying,
just gonna assume you're on board.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.125
On my mark. Ready?

22:19.166 --> 22:20.166
Shoot up.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.875
Kazi...

22:41.625 --> 22:43.208
That was amazing!

22:45.708 --> 22:46.958
Take this. Cover me.

22:47.625 --> 22:50.041
A USB arrow?
What am I supposed to do with this?

22:50.125 --> 22:52.541
God, I hope he's got
a dongle arrow to make this useful.

23:00.666 --> 23:02.000
Don't move!

23:02.958 --> 23:05.708
You do not wanna see what this arrow does!

23:05.791 --> 23:07.166
Trust me.

23:09.916 --> 23:11.333
Follow me.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.791
Whoo-hoo!

23:23.875 --> 23:25.291
Whoa!

23:34.000 --> 23:36.291
Damn it. Come on, let's go!

23:36.708 --> 23:39.125
Now I get
the whole plunger arrow thing.

23:53.125 --> 23:54.791
Oh, we gotta walk the dog.

23:56.250 --> 23:57.458
You're not wrong...

23:58.541 --> 24:00.333
He's been cooped up all day.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.166
Not quite sure how long a dog can--

24:03.250 --> 24:05.708
...call yourself
one of the world's greatest archers.

24:08.833 --> 24:10.958
Oh, my God, do you really think so?

24:11.041 --> 24:13.291
I wasn't sure
how I'd do under all that pressure...

24:13.375 --> 24:16.083
Probably should walk the dog.
Don't you think?

24:19.208 --> 24:21.750
-Been cooped up all day.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.083
Hey, Clint.

25:06.916 --> 25:08.958
-Hey, hey, babe.
-NATHANIEL: <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

25:09.041 --> 25:11.583
Hey, listen,
I can't really talk right now,

25:11.666 --> 25:13.375
uh, 'cause look... Maybe...

25:13.458 --> 25:15.750
Do you have time to text? Can you text?

25:15.833 --> 25:17.708
-Can you text me?
-Clint, Clint, Clint.

25:19.708 --> 25:20.916
What?

25:23.708 --> 25:26.166
Nathaniel? Nathaniel, what are you...

25:27.500 --> 25:28.791
What are you doin', buddy?

25:28.875 --> 25:30.916
Is everything okay? Where's Mama?

25:31.958 --> 25:33.291
<i>She's still asleep.</i>

25:33.375 --> 25:35.625
<i>I'm so bored.</i>

25:35.708 --> 25:39.000
Look, there's a...
there might be a little delay, buddy.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.708
It's kind of a bad connection.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.125
You're bored.

25:45.583 --> 25:49.250
You're the early bird.
Hey, bud, I miss you.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.000
Why don't you go get some breakfast

25:52.666 --> 25:54.833
and read a book
or somethin' till Mama wakes up?

25:55.625 --> 25:57.791
<i>What's the point</i>
<i>of even reading a book?</i>

25:58.791 --> 26:02.416
<i>Are you coming home tonight?</i>
<i>It's Christmas movie marathon.</i>

26:07.083 --> 26:08.916
Uh, yeah, it's...

26:09.000 --> 26:11.583
Tonight is movie marathon night,
that's right. Um...

26:12.708 --> 26:15.083
I really wish
I could be there with you, buddy.

26:15.166 --> 26:17.375
Uh, you know how much I love that.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.875
Um, but I'm not gonna make it.

26:19.958 --> 26:23.958
But I think I'll be back
in the next day or so.

26:24.041 --> 26:28.458
Yeah, we'll be in time
for our ugly Christmas sweater party.

26:28.541 --> 26:29.791
You ready for that?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Nathaniel?

26:34.958 --> 26:36.541
Buddy?

26:37.208 --> 26:40.458
<i>It's okay if you can't</i>
<i>come home for Christmas, Daddy.</i>

26:40.541 --> 26:42.041
<i>We understand.</i>

26:42.125 --> 26:45.791
Oh, boy, I'm... I tell you,
I miss you so much.

26:54.916 --> 26:57.458
Um, I'm gonna be there, buddy.

26:57.541 --> 27:01.375
I... You know I'm gonna be there,
like I said, right?

27:01.458 --> 27:04.458
Um, I'm so happy to hear your voice.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.250
Daddy's gotta go, okay?

27:09.708 --> 27:10.916
I love you.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.208
<i>Love you, Daddy.</i>

27:13.291 --> 27:14.500
I love you more.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.166
Bye-bye.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Thank you.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.333
Yeah.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.500
Careful with it. Up top.

27:45.083 --> 27:47.666
I was just getting
used to this place, you know.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.333
Yeah, well, now it's compromised.

27:54.791 --> 27:55.833
Hey. Hey.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.500
No.

29:08.166 --> 29:10.333
Block. Delete.

29:12.541 --> 29:13.750
Morning.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.500
What are you waiting for?

29:16.083 --> 29:17.916
Uh, you. You're the doctor, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I'm very busy.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.583
Oh. Well... Really need this fixed.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.000
Please?

29:24.083 --> 29:26.416
Give me five minutes. Cash only.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.166
Thank you.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.416
Told you we'd get it fixed.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.250
What was most amazing though...

29:34.333 --> 29:37.333
Better than anything we did
in the middle of that crazy battle.

29:37.708 --> 29:39.083
That little...

29:50.000 --> 29:51.500
-Was that...

29:51.583 --> 29:53.000
Was that out the whole time?

29:54.333 --> 29:55.791
Can I get more coffee, please?

29:55.875 --> 29:57.208
Yeah, sure.

29:57.291 --> 29:58.291
Thank you.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.541
Look, I know this may sound weird,

30:02.625 --> 30:07.333
but I've dreamed of this
for as long as I can remember.

30:07.416 --> 30:10.541
My dad was fearless.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.333
And his whole life
was about helping people.

30:14.166 --> 30:18.041
When I put that suit on,
I thought, "This is it.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.916
"This is the moment
I become who I'm supposed to be."

30:21.000 --> 30:23.166
I remember the day
I thought the same thing.

30:25.416 --> 30:30.958
You know, it's, uh...
It comes with a price.

30:31.833 --> 30:32.833
What does?

30:32.916 --> 30:34.291
This life you wanna live.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.875
To really help people.

30:35.958 --> 30:37.916
I mean, try to help people, anyway.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.833
Comes with a lot of sacrifices.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.166
And some things you'll lose... forever.

30:48.125 --> 30:51.958
Well, there's also things you gain,

30:53.500 --> 30:55.583
like trick arrows and a cool costume.

30:56.875 --> 30:58.500
Speaking of which.

30:58.583 --> 31:00.666
I've been thinking
about your branding issue.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.333
You need a more recognizable costume.

31:07.750 --> 31:11.875
Uh, you realize
that my job for the last 20 years

31:12.500 --> 31:14.541
was to be not recognizable, right?

31:14.625 --> 31:16.416
Well, you've officially failed at that.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.083
Picture this... in purple.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.583
Oh, wow.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.500
-What's that on his head?
-It's your head.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.666
Uh, wings. Like a hawk.

31:30.291 --> 31:34.250
That's an "H" that's on your forehead.
That's... for "Hawkeye."

31:34.333 --> 31:35.958
Well, not happening.

31:36.333 --> 31:37.916
Okay. Um...

31:39.791 --> 31:42.375
What if it was all black?
All black with a mask?

31:43.833 --> 31:45.000
Maybe a hood?

31:47.208 --> 31:49.416
You can't say who Ronin is

31:49.500 --> 31:53.125
because it's someone
close to you, isn't it?

31:55.541 --> 31:57.708
It's your job to keep their secret.

32:02.125 --> 32:06.625
There are several reasons
why I'd never wear a flashy costume.

32:07.291 --> 32:09.625
My job is to be, number one, a ghost.

32:10.666 --> 32:15.666
Number two, my wife would divorce me
if I put something like this on.

32:15.750 --> 32:16.875
Hmm?

32:16.958 --> 32:18.916
And number three, uh...

32:21.208 --> 32:22.583
I'm not a role model.

32:25.041 --> 32:27.791
I'm sorry, Kate.
I'm not a role model to anyone.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.750
Never have been.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.000
What? Yes, you are.

32:36.666 --> 32:39.250
You are. You... You came here.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.333
You left your family at Christmas

32:41.416 --> 32:44.166
because you thought
some stranger was gonna get hurt.

32:44.833 --> 32:47.166
You stuck around even though I screwed up.

32:48.166 --> 32:49.583
And now you're stuck.

32:50.791 --> 32:52.458
Whether you like it or not,

32:53.583 --> 32:55.958
the Tracksuits
have connected us both to Ronin,

32:56.041 --> 32:58.916
and it's pretty clear
they're not just gonna drop this.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.833
Well, that you are not wrong about.

33:01.916 --> 33:05.041
Not to mention the fact
that my mom might be marrying a murderer.

33:05.125 --> 33:06.791
And then there's that.

33:07.416 --> 33:09.833
As far as I'm concerned,
we're in this together.

33:12.916 --> 33:15.583
I'm gonna need you to get that.
My mom canceled my credit card.

33:16.791 --> 33:18.500
-Yeah, I got it.
-Thank you.

33:20.500 --> 33:23.416
All right. And look...

33:23.500 --> 33:26.125
You're gonna have
to name this dog, you know.

33:26.208 --> 33:27.416
Sure.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.833
Little Ol' Caesar?

33:32.916 --> 33:34.458
Dogfather?

33:34.541 --> 33:35.958
Sir Dog of Pizza?

33:38.208 --> 33:39.208
Pizza Dog?

33:44.708 --> 33:46.583
All right, partner, let's get into it.

33:46.666 --> 33:50.625
You pick up on any tension between
Maya and the hot guy, or was it just me?

33:50.708 --> 33:52.125
His name's Kazi.

33:52.208 --> 33:55.375
All right, so I take it these Tracksuit
guys are into some pretty bad stuff?

33:56.375 --> 33:57.916
Yeah, bad stuff.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.125
You care to elaborate?

34:01.208 --> 34:02.375
Not really.

34:06.083 --> 34:08.083
They started small, but grew.

34:08.166 --> 34:11.791
Or at least the guy at the top,
he'll do anything to grow the operation.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.916
I thought Maya was the boss.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.041
No, there's someone above Maya.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.833
Someone you don't wanna mess with.

34:17.916 --> 34:20.041
There's obviously
bad blood with Ronin, right?

34:20.125 --> 34:21.125
Yeah.

34:21.208 --> 34:25.583
Ronin hit the supplier on the other side
and then hit Tracksuit upper management.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.208
Sounds like a lot of drama.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.625
Which is why you should
never get involved in organized crime.

34:32.708 --> 34:36.166
Do you think that the Tracksuits
were after anything else at that auction?

34:36.250 --> 34:39.041
I don't know.
I was pretty focused on Jack and Armand.

34:39.125 --> 34:41.375
It's pretty upsetting to think
there might be stuff

34:41.458 --> 34:43.916
from the Avengers Compound
floating around out there.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.166
So, you still think
Jack is involved somehow?

34:46.250 --> 34:49.000
Yes. There's too many coincidences.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.541
He was at the auction that night,

34:50.625 --> 34:52.500
and yesterday,
he offered me a butterscotch.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.250
Not exactly a crime.

34:56.333 --> 34:58.583
When I tried to stab his face
to prove he was lying,

34:58.666 --> 35:00.125
he parried like a pro.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.125
You tried to stab your mom's fiancé?

35:02.208 --> 35:04.708
Plus, he has everything
to gain from Armand's death.

35:04.791 --> 35:06.333
The Jack thing, it's weird.

35:07.041 --> 35:09.208
I get it, but it's not exactly airtight.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.416
Right.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.333
Which is why we need more evidence.

35:13.041 --> 35:15.375
And why we're gonna
sneak into my mom's penthouse.

35:15.458 --> 35:16.500
Wait, wait, wait, what?

35:16.583 --> 35:18.041
We can get into her company files.

35:18.125 --> 35:20.666
Bishop Security
has a huge criminal database.

35:20.750 --> 35:23.708
There's gotta be info
on the Tracksuits and Jack in there.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.291
Yeah.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.375
You're sure no one's home, right?

35:51.458 --> 35:52.833
Yes. Relax.

35:53.458 --> 35:54.541
Come on.

35:55.458 --> 35:57.375
Jeez, this is a home?

35:58.250 --> 36:01.833
Yeah. My, uh, great, great, great,
great grandfather built the building.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.166
I tried to swing from that very chandelier
and broke my arm.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.625
So, uh, yeah, pretty impressive family,
all the way around.

36:07.708 --> 36:08.708
Wow.

36:11.250 --> 36:12.250
Impressive.

36:16.416 --> 36:17.666
So, from the home network,

36:17.750 --> 36:20.791
we should be able to get past
the encryption with my mom's password.

36:22.375 --> 36:24.000
Yeah, I'm in the wrong business.

36:26.833 --> 36:28.625
How'd you say Armand was killed?

36:29.500 --> 36:31.041
Stabbed with a sword.

36:33.791 --> 36:35.708
See if there's anything on Kazi.

36:36.708 --> 36:38.833
Okay. Let's see.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.333
Here we go.

36:44.083 --> 36:46.541
Okay, what's this company, Sloan Limited?

36:46.625 --> 36:47.958
Kazi is an employee?

36:48.041 --> 36:50.375
Wait, Sloan Limited,
that sounds familiar.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.916
You think there's somethin' there?

36:53.875 --> 36:54.916
I don't know.

36:56.791 --> 36:57.916
Maybe.

36:58.791 --> 37:00.916
Let me see
what I can pull up on Jack.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.208
Crap.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.791
Now there's an embedded
hardware authentication.

37:09.958 --> 37:11.625
And I've just been locked out.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Clint?

37:24.916 --> 37:26.208
Don't move.
