00:01.400 --> 00:03.600
'Previously on St Elsewhere...'

00:03.600 --> 00:05.000
The more you struggle,

00:05.000 --> 00:07.440
the greater your chances
of getting seriously hurt.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.320
Who are you?

00:10.320 --> 00:11.760
'Tonight on St Elsewhere...'

00:11.760 --> 00:13.720
Have you heard anything
from Cathy Martin?

00:13.720 --> 00:15.200
No, not even a postcard.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.960
I've never be unfaithful
to my wife.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.280
How long have you been married?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.960
How long have you been married?

00:19.960 --> 00:21.280
Long enough.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.640
How do you know Dr Ehrlich?

00:22.640 --> 00:25.320
This morning he checked out my ribs.
And I...

00:25.320 --> 00:26.480
Checked him out.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.560
Dr Fiscus.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.000
Oh, thanks anyways,
but I'm on call tonight.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.640
Suppose they pick you as
the St Eligius Doctor Of The Year.

00:32.640 --> 00:33.880
I'll demand a recount.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.880
I'm certain you're going to get
the nod, Mark.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.480
You did our first heart transplant.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.680
Yeah, but you've been here
for 35 years.

00:39.680 --> 00:40.760
And I am dying.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.400
You're right.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.760
And all along this is
what you really wanted.

00:44.760 --> 00:48.760
You're crazy!

02:31.800 --> 02:35.800
Oatmeal. Are you sure
those are raisons in there?

02:36.720 --> 02:39.720
Moctezuma omelettes.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.880
I think I'll go

02:40.880 --> 02:42.960
with the short stack, hold the slaw.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.160
How come you guys use the same knife
to cut the melons as you do

02:46.160 --> 02:48.920
to cut the garlic?

02:48.920 --> 02:50.000
Shut up, Fiscus.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.520
I forgot, dieticians
have no sense of humour.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.520
2.25.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.160
Thank you.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.680
Six dollars.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.120
You owe me from yesterday.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.400
You're charging me for this?

03:05.400 --> 03:08.160
Oh, shut up, Fiscus.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.280
Shut up, Fiscus.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.760
Shut up, Fiscus.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.200
I'm a doctor, I'm educated,

03:12.200 --> 03:13.320
I deserve respect.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.760
Yeah, like Rodney Dangerfield.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.280
Ehrlich, what happened
to your Hawaiian shirts?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.840
Nothing wrong with a little change
now and then.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.400
You look like J Edgar Hoover.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.840
Shut up, Fiscus.

03:24.840 --> 03:28.680
Wendy.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.200
Have you seen Cathy Martin lately?

03:30.200 --> 03:32.920
Mm, no. I called her apartment
a couple of times, no answer.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.440
It's strange her disappearing
suddenly for no reason.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.880
Strange behaviour
and Cathy Martin are synonymous.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.400
Hello, everyone.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.240
Well, here I am, bright and early

03:41.240 --> 03:44.880
with your complementary tickets
to tonight's Women's Auxiliary

03:44.880 --> 03:47.120
&lt; Fundraising Dinner, Dance,
Awards Presentation.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.120
What, no bingo?

03:49.120 --> 03:50.920
¤150 a plate?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.960
Lucky for you, residents get in free.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.080
Nurses have to pay.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.560
Dr Fiscus.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.480
Oh, I'm on call tonight.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.160
Suppose they pick you
as St Eligius Doctor Of The Year.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.480
I'll demand a recount.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.040
You know,
if you can't get a date for tonight,

04:04.040 --> 04:07.480
my niece, Cornelia,
is a delightful girl.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.640
Mrs Jesmer, I'm working, really.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.600
Oh, what a shame.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.760
Well, see the rest of you tonight.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.160
All the doctors are supposed

04:16.160 --> 04:17.399
to go to the fundraiser.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.440
Yes, the trustees expect it.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.440
I know, I have never been
so thrilled to be on call.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.360
'Maintenance to North entrance.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.720
'Maintenance to North entrance.'

04:26.720 --> 04:28.920
Good morning, Dr Ehrlich.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.760
Mrs Jesmer, what a surprise.

04:30.760 --> 04:31.920
How are the hammer toes?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.680
All cured, all healed.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.320
Great. This is my wife, Roberta.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.440
Hello.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.000
Oh, you're the one I've heard about.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.520
Well, anyway,

04:40.520 --> 04:42.840
here are your tickets
for the Ritz Carlton tonight.

04:42.840 --> 04:43.880
Thanks loads.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.240
I'm real excited about going.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.840
Oh, that's nice, dear.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.360
But do me a favour,
be like everyone else,

04:50.360 --> 04:54.360
leave the problems
with your marriage at home.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.200
Ta-ta.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.160
Bye.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.320
Great, that's just great,
even Mrs Jesmer knows.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.360
So what?

05:03.360 --> 05:05.960
These are people I have to deal
with on a day-to-day basis.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.680
You're just mad because I threw away
your old Beach Boy mug.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.400
Hey, it was an heirloom.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.360
No, Victor, the 19th-century
sewing kit of my mother's

05:14.360 --> 05:17.520
is an heirloom, some old stained mug
with the lyrics to I Get Around

05:17.520 --> 05:19.800
on the rim is junk.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.040
You're right.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.160
And I wish you wouldn't put the
flatwear in the dishwasher any more.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.800
I won't do it any more, honeybunch.
I swear.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.800
Or put the tin cans
in with the regular garbage.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.480
It's a promise.

05:31.480 --> 05:35.200
Or wear those silly Hawaiian shirts.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.200
I stopped it, didn't I?

05:37.200 --> 05:40.040
But Weiss said marriage
is compromise,

05:40.040 --> 05:41.360
so now you do something for me.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.400
Of course, what?

05:44.400 --> 05:45.840
Quit your job here.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.160
With all those rapes going on,

05:47.160 --> 05:49.160
I'm worried about you coming
to the hospital.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.000
OK.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.240
Wait a second, you mean it?

05:52.240 --> 05:54.400
Sure. I'm bored with candy stripping.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.160
Oh, my gosh, really?

05:55.160 --> 05:56.200
Oh, my gosh, really?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.560
It is about time
I altered the course of my life.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.000
Good for you.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.280
I'm going to be a doctor.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.160
Peter, are you sure you don't want
anything for breakfast?

06:06.160 --> 06:10.000
No, that's all right,
don't put yourself out.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
It's no bother.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.280
Peter, we can't stop
talking to each other.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.040
I'm sorry I spoiled our anniversary.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.360
You didn't spoil anything.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.160
Really.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.840
You've been great.
Look, I'll tell you what,

06:30.840 --> 06:33.040
we'll have a belated celebration,
all right?

06:33.040 --> 06:35.360
OK.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.360
Uh-oh. Mommy! Mommy!

06:39.600 --> 06:43.520
Mommy, my zipper is stuck.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.200
Well, here, let Mommy help you.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.200
KNOCKING

06:50.800 --> 06:51.840
Hey.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.800
Morning. You ready?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.360
Yeah, make yourself at home,
have some coffee or something.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.560
No, no thanks,
I don't want to be late for rounds.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.200
I'll be right back,
I've just got to get my jacket.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.320
I'll be right back,
I've just got to get my jacket.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.480
Hi.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.760
Hi, Phil.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.320
Thanks for helping us out.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.200
I think our car will be
out of the shop by tomorrow.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.280
I think our car will be
out of the shop by tomorrow.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.880
How are you doing?

07:10.880 --> 07:11.920
Fine.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.280
Good.  There we go.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.160
'Are you going
to the big dinner tonight?

07:15.160 --> 07:16.400
'Yep, you?

07:16.400 --> 07:20.400
'Peter says...'

07:43.680 --> 07:45.480
Good morning.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.200
I swung by your place
on the way in.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.560
Gee, that's a good look for you.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.600
Thanks.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.760
Come by to have breakfast?

07:50.760 --> 07:51.960
No.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.960
No, to drop off your tuxedo.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.560
The fundraiser tonight.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.520
Joan, I'm not going to another
rubber chicken dinner in a gymnasium.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.320
I'd hardly call
the Ritz a gymnasium.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.440
Big deal.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.120
Take out the hoops
and they laid in carpets.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.920
Honey, it's for St Eligius.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.920
I already sent in my ¤300 donation.

08:12.920 --> 08:13.480
Deduction.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.640
Deduction.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.040
Look, the reason I wasn't home
when you came by is because

08:17.040 --> 08:19.320
I've been in the OR
since 12:45 this morning.

08:19.320 --> 08:23.120
I've worked on three burn victims
and I'm beat.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.640
Come on, let's go to breakfast.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.040
Can't you take a nap at lunch
or something?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.640
You know this dinner means a lot
to the Women's Auxiliary.

08:29.640 --> 08:30.680
It is an important night for them.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.760
It is an important night for them.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.960
Who's arguing?

08:33.960 --> 08:37.960
Look, do you want to have
breakfast or not?

08:39.080 --> 08:40.760
Follow the light
with just your eyes. &gt;

08:40.760 --> 08:41.799
OK.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.720
&lt; I don't know how you do it,
scrambling around those girders.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.760
I don't think about it much. At
least not on the smaller buildings.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.640
But when you work on something
like the Pru or the Hancock,

08:50.640 --> 08:52.440
believe me,
you learn how to concentrate.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.960
You worked on the Hancock building?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.360
Yeah.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.840
Oh, it's a beautiful building.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.560
Except for the flying glass.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.200
What do you mean?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.760
They had a problem with
the high ones on Dartmouth Street.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.480
The stress made the windows blow
out. But it's taken care of now.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.080
I've got to admit,
a building like that, &gt;

09:08.080 --> 09:09.760
I couldn't have designed better.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.720
Most of the ones
I work on by the numbers.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.720
All done.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.520
All done.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.160
More tests.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.920
What? No, no, no.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.760
No. Enough is enough.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.240
I've had blood tests
and X-ray tests

09:23.240 --> 09:25.760
and this test and that test
and this test and that test.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.640
I'm going to be paying
this bill off for 15 years!

09:28.640 --> 09:30.040
Don't you have union insurance?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.320
&lt; Yeah, it pays for some of it,

09:31.320 --> 09:34.040
but I've got a mom, a sister
and a newborn kid to support.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.280
These are very basic tests,
Mr Keuhnelian.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.120
There isn't any pain involved.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.720
&lt; And it's not very expensive.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.320
OK.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.320
But if nothing shows up on these,
I am checking out.

09:56.960 --> 10:00.640
Maybe his blackouts are
a sign of toxicity or drug use.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.080
I don't think so.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.160
But there is more to this
than he is letting on.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.160
I just can't seem to get
it out of him.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.080
Which is why it's time
for Meldrin and an OPG.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.840
God...
I knew you were going to say that.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.160
I know it is like throwing him
to the lions...

10:14.160 --> 10:15.920
I know it is like throwing him
to the lions...

10:15.920 --> 10:17.680
Maybe I should go, too.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.160
You've done as much for Keuhnelian
as you possibly can.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.680
It's so sad.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.040
He's his family's
only source of income.

10:26.040 --> 10:26.800
That's not your problem.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.240
That's not your problem.

10:28.240 --> 10:32.080
I know. But I'm worried that whatever
it is that Keuhnelian has got

10:32.080 --> 10:34.280
could destroy a family.

10:34.280 --> 10:38.280
I don't want to just sit
on the sidelines while that happens.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.560
Thank you.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.280
Well, you know the last time
I was going to have the implant,

10:43.280 --> 10:46.240
I had a whole list of reasons.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.640
Ira wanted it,
maybe it would help our marriage,

10:49.640 --> 10:52.120
maybe help the kids feel
more comfortable about it.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.040
And this time?

10:54.040 --> 10:58.040
Well, I'm coming up on a birthday
and I don't want to face it,

10:58.800 --> 11:02.800
and I don't want to face it
with only one breast.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.560
I bet Ira's pleased.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.040
He doesn't know.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.720
Ms Czerwinski.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.840
Mara.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.600
Hi. I'm Victor Ehrlich.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.640
Dr Iberl asked me
to cover for him today.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.040
I understand you've got
a bit of a rib problem.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.080
Next time,
I will watch where I'm going.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.480
Could I ask you to lie
on your side, please?

11:22.480 --> 11:25.800
OK.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.040
Breathe deep.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.560
Does it hurt to breathe?

11:28.560 --> 11:29.600
Not too much.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.040
Breathe very deep again.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.680
Imagine slipping
on a puddle of beer.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.480
There I went,
flying across the floor.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.520
Bars are dangerous places.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.760
OK, do you think
you could stand up?

11:41.760 --> 11:43.520
Nothing wrong with my legs.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.480
No, nothing at all.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.080
OK. Let me check you out here.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.440
You ought to stop by the bar
some night, I'll stand you

11:51.440 --> 11:52.560
to a round at happy hour.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.960
I'm...I'm married.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.240
No kidding.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.240
OK, I've got to ask you
to breathe deep.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.600
And breathe deep again.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.600
Could you hold still, please?

12:07.680 --> 12:09.040
Does that feel OK?

12:09.040 --> 12:10.480
Great hands.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.840
Funny, isn't it?

12:11.840 --> 12:14.920
I'm on my feet
and you're on the bed.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.000
Well, you've got great powers
of recuperation.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.200
Bruised ribs never
got in anyone's way.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.440
And I'll tell you something, Doc,

12:21.440 --> 12:23.000
you've got it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.160
I've got IT, huh?

12:25.160 --> 12:27.880
The scent,
the married guy on the prowl look.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.480
It drives me nuts.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.400
I've never been unfaithful
to my wife.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.360
How long have you been married?

12:34.360 --> 12:35.560
16 days.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.880
Long enough.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.400
Look, I have got a lot

12:38.400 --> 12:40.880
of other patients to see,
why don't you lie down?

12:40.880 --> 12:44.880
OK, but I won't be here later.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.400
(SIGHS)

12:56.720 --> 12:58.200
Are you coming alone?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.760
Yeah, I wouldn't subject my daughter
to a fundraiser, Mark,

13:00.760 --> 13:02.120
she still has ideals.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.080
Oh, listen to you, St Eligius
Doctor Of The Year 1983.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.000
Well, I think
you're going to win tonight.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.040
No, no.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.160
Well, I don't really care.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.760
I mean, what are we talking about?

13:12.760 --> 13:16.440
A scroll of paper
with your name inscribed on it.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.000
In gold.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.040
In gold.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.920
Donald, Mark.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.680
My money is on you, Daniel.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.680
For what?

13:22.680 --> 13:25.120
For what?

13:25.120 --> 13:27.080
I'm certain you are going to get
the nod, Mark.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.720
You did our first heart transplant.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.200
Yeah, but you've been here
for 35 years.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.000
And I am dying.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.840
You're right.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.440
Well, maybe it will be a tie.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.280
I'm glad I'm not in the running
this year.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.200
'Security to Admitting.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.000
'Security to Admitting.'

13:44.000 --> 13:47.280
It's important for a resident
to be seen at things like this.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.680
Phil, that's my point.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.720
What?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.280
Tuxedos, orchestra.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.280
I was sort of hoping our first date
would be a little more...private.

13:56.280 --> 14:00.040
Well, that's, uh...
that's the second date.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.040
OK. Pick me up at seven. Bye!

14:03.040 --> 14:05.520
Bye-bye. Oh...

14:05.520 --> 14:08.440
Oh, I'm sorry, come right on in.

14:08.440 --> 14:12.440
Take your time.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.000
No, you go ahead.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.040
That's all right, really, come on.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.840
No, I'll wait for the next one.

14:19.840 --> 14:23.040
Ma'am, I'm a doctor,
you've got nothing to worry about.

14:23.040 --> 14:27.040
I'll wait for the next one!

14:40.440 --> 14:41.480
How much longer?

14:41.480 --> 14:42.560
Just a few seconds.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.360
It feels funny.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.960
It's supposed to.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.960
It would go a lot quicker
if you'd stop twitching.

14:52.640 --> 14:56.640
I'm going to do this one more time.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.760
Anything unusual?

15:07.760 --> 15:11.760
Chart.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.960
Now, how many of these spells
have you had?

15:16.960 --> 15:19.440
Just one, a couple of days ago,
in the hospital.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.400
It must've been a side effect
of the accident.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.920
I doubt it.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.080
If you want to stonewall us,
that's your decision,

15:26.080 --> 15:28.800
but unless you give us the full
story, there's nothing we can do.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.200
&lt; If you leave here before we figure
out what's wrong,

15:31.200 --> 15:33.400
&lt; you will be no good
to your family at all.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.760
Maybe a couple of times I've fallen,
not nearly so bad.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.160
A couple times before?

15:38.160 --> 15:40.280
3, 10? 40?

15:40.280 --> 15:42.200
12, since last summer.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.240
But they only lasted a second.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.360
And you had one last week just
before you fell off the building.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.360
Yeah, I guess I should have told you.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.560
For the last one,
his vision was totally blocked

15:51.560 --> 15:54.480
and motor response
in his left side was nil.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.760
Yep, I can read.
Do you drink and smoke?

15:57.760 --> 16:00.640
A pack a day on the average.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.400
Maybe a couple of beers.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.040
No wonder.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.720
Your carotid artery
is narrowed with plaque.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.400
Once I evaluate your OPGs,

16:08.400 --> 16:11.440
I bet we'll find
differing eyeball pressures.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.680
So?

16:12.680 --> 16:16.680
You've been having
transient ischemic attacks.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.640
Occasional interruptions
in the flow of blood to the brain.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.800
We can treat it.

16:20.800 --> 16:21.840
I won't die?

16:21.840 --> 16:24.360
Eventually. Not from this.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.280
Aspirin and 25 mg of Persantine
three times daily.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.760
What if the attacks don't stop?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.000
You may need surgery.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.080
I don't want that.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.480
You want a stroke? That's next.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.400
From this point on, construction
work is out of the question.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.960
Do you get a kick out of saying that?

16:37.960 --> 16:40.880
Mr Keuhnelian, what you've got
is a lifestyle disease.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.520
Cigarettes, occupational stress,

16:43.520 --> 16:45.000
a high-fat diet.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.800
You asked for a prognosis,
I gave it.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.440
To a large extent,
your future is in your own hands.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.440
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to lunch.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.599
That to me is a trickery procedure.

17:06.599 --> 17:10.280
Holding the lung back
is crucial to its success.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.640
I know.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.200
Then, would it be asking
too much for you to do it?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.800
Don't puncture it, Ehrlich.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.040
What's the matter?
Still having trouble at home?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.640
Can I speak freely?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.400
A little more exposure, please.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.440
Like that?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.800
Perfect. Yeah, go ahead.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.000
I've dealt with hundreds of hearts,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.080
I've dealt with hundreds of hearts,

17:29.080 --> 17:30.800
It's Roberta.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.080
Actually, it's not, it's Mara.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.600
Who?

17:34.600 --> 17:38.600
Let me ask you something, Dr Craig.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.560
Have you ever been tempted
to stray from the path of virtue?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.360
Of course not. I'm in love
with my wife, she's in love with me.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.080
I wish I could say the same.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.320
Ehrlich,
you've been married two weeks.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.320
You've made a very serious
commitment to a lovely young girl.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.040
But she wants to be a doctor.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.280
That looney tunes?

17:54.280 --> 17:55.320
Retractor.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.920
Right.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.320
You're going to have to get used
to the idea of being responsible

18:00.320 --> 18:02.480
for your actions, both as a man
and as a surgeon.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.440
Hey, I'm just trying
to sort out my options.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.880
Ehrlich,
you couldn't sort out your laundry.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.160
For Pete's sake,
weren't you listening to your vows?

18:09.160 --> 18:12.880
"Till death do us part."

18:12.880 --> 18:14.680
I won't have a surgeon who gives up,

18:14.680 --> 18:17.480
neither in the middle of
an operation or in a marriage.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.680
I will be very disappointed in you
if you get a divorce.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.000
Yes, sir.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.800
I'm going to give you some advice
that Dr David Demidian,

18:24.800 --> 18:28.320
Chief of Surgery
when I was a resident, gave me.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.960
When you get stuck with a lemon,
you just have to spit out the pits

18:31.960 --> 18:35.320
and live with the juice.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.440
The man's a redneck.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.960
He eats and smokes his way
into the hospital, denies his entire

18:39.960 --> 18:43.120
medical history and then expects us
to cure him overnight?

18:43.120 --> 18:46.320
This man has a right to some caring
and some sensitivity.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.880
And an accurate diagnosis.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.200
Three dollars. &gt;

18:49.200 --> 18:52.160
I shouldn't have had to worm
the truth out of him.

18:52.160 --> 18:56.160
I was closing in on it.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.680
You have a reputation for being
popular with the patients.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.200
Matching that charm with a little
medical insight wouldn't hurt.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.120
You were unnecessarily rude

19:05.120 --> 19:07.520
and abusive to a guy
who is obviously upset.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.440
Wait till you've been here four and
a half years and seen as many winos

19:11.440 --> 19:14.000
and fakers and self-destructive
patients as I have,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
you will lose that idealistic squint
soon enough.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.520
'Nurse Hernandez to Station 2E.
Nurse Hernandez...'

19:22.600 --> 19:26.600
Bobby, over here with that.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.000
You look terrible.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.600
Problem in postop.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.920
Has Joan told you
her marvellous idea?

19:36.920 --> 19:40.920
Nope, can't wait to hear it.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.600
Well, tell him.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.880
I thought St Eligius might set up
a rape treatment centre.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.760
That way we can provide
not only medical but legal

19:48.760 --> 19:50.760
and psychological
counselling for victims.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.680
That's great. With your track record
for closing down departments,

19:53.680 --> 19:55.920
the last thing I thought you'd do
is open up another.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.040
She's got that solved, too.
Don't you, Joan?

19:58.040 --> 20:02.040
I think we can cover the costs
with fees, grants and donations.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.880
Now, don't you two talk at home?

20:07.640 --> 20:11.000
Oh, I see, some kind of argument.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.680
Well, I know that if you approach
this as too levelheaded adults,

20:14.680 --> 20:18.680
everything will come out fine.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.760
Peter.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.560
Anybody home?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.760
Oh, there you are.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.800
I dropped a sponge.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.200
Didn't you hear me call you?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.880
What's up?

20:35.880 --> 20:38.360
I want to make sure someone
will be around four o'clock.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.760
The Douglas family wants
to see their Uncle Bub.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.880
Right, the spleen guy.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.200
It's freezing in here.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.040
Listen, have you heard anything
from Cathy Martin?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.520
No, not even a postcard.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.960
Yeah, neither has anybody else.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.800
It's kind of funny her
just disappearing out of blue

20:52.800 --> 20:54.000
like that, isn't it?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.560
Mm.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.520
Oh, by the way, Dr Morey wanted me

20:57.520 --> 21:00.640
to pick up the autopsy report
on that Hasselhoff car wreck.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.560
It's right over there.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.400
It's good to see you, Shirl.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.280
It gets kind of lonely down here.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.520
I can't find it.

21:10.520 --> 21:14.520
Let me help you.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.240
Oh, here it is.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.800
Thanks.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.120
See you.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.040
Do you have to rush off?

21:23.040 --> 21:24.520
Yeah, afraid so.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.000
Look, I just want to apologise
for what happened in the ER

21:27.000 --> 21:28.160
a couple of weeks ago.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.520
Saying those rotten things,
getting in the way.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.720
It's OK, Peter.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.040
Because we're friends.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.480
Nurse Daniels, things are getting
real busy down in ER.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.160
They sent me to track you down. &gt;

21:39.160 --> 21:40.560
Sure, I'm on my way.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.560
See you later, Peter.

21:59.800 --> 22:03.720
Hiya, Victor.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.520
It's called a hand.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.600
Did you know the government once
dropped highly radioactive gold?

22:08.600 --> 22:11.800
Now it's turning up all over America
in the form of necklaces, bracelets,

22:11.800 --> 22:12.840
wedding rings...

22:12.840 --> 22:14.600
Don't panic
until your finger falls off.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.560
Don't you see? It's a cosmic symbol.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.880
The wedding band,
once put on, never to be removed.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.560
It has the potential to kill,
slowly, painfully.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.760
I thought you and Roberta
worked out your problems.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.520
I wish. "Do this, do that,
go there, stay here."

22:26.520 --> 22:30.040
Whenever someone tells me how
to run my life, man, I rear back.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.440
Try being taken for granted.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.160
How about being called a jackass
over the hospital PA system?

22:34.160 --> 22:35.880
I can still hear the snickering.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.960
She has absolutely no idea
what I do for a living.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.920
That happens
when you have nothing in common.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.600
You mean like her insisting
on an appearance at the fundraiser

22:42.600 --> 22:43.960
after the day we put in today?

22:43.960 --> 22:46.120
Exactly. This whole relationship
is a mistake -

22:46.120 --> 22:48.920
like Napoleon's invasion of Russia
and the Watergate tapes.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.000
That's not exactly true. She is
a funny, intelligent, sexy woman.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.240
Yeah, but do you want to spend
your life with her?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.520
Worth a try.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.560
Craig says once you are stuck,
it's for good.

22:57.560 --> 23:00.080
What the difference what Craig
thinks, it's not his life.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.840
You're right, man, that does it.
I'm going to go home and tell her.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.040
Yeah, tonight's the night.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.320
My mind is made up.  Mine, too.

23:05.320 --> 23:05.800
I'm getting divorced.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.800
I'm getting divorced.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.000
&lt; Yes, Mrs Francis's room, 308.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.160
&lt; You're welcome.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.400
Hi. I'd like to check out.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.240
Mara Czerwinski.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.720
OK. Oh, beautiful flowers.

23:26.720 --> 23:30.720
"Get back to the bar, you lazy slob.
We miss you. Goopy and the guys."

23:31.120 --> 23:32.240
Sentimental, you know?

23:32.240 --> 23:35.360
You work in a bar, huh? Sign here.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.880
Pays the rent and you meet some
really interesting people.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.640
Try a hospital sometime.

23:39.640 --> 23:43.640
I know what you mean.
Like the well-endowed Dr Ehrlich?

23:43.760 --> 23:45.160
How do you know Dr Ehrlich?

23:45.160 --> 23:46.840
He's hard to miss.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.920
This morning he checked out my ribs
and I...

23:49.920 --> 23:51.480
Checked him out.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.120
He's got some hands.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.200
When he touched my chest, I tingled.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.560
Oh, I see, his...hands.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.600
What a cutie.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.640
Say, would you do me a favour?

24:00.640 --> 24:04.640
I asked him to stop by the bar,
but I didn't say where it was.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.640
Can you give this to him?

24:06.640 --> 24:08.920
Oh, I'll give it to him all right.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.840
Thanks. Well...

24:12.840 --> 24:14.560
I can make happy hour if I run.

24:14.560 --> 24:18.560
Walk.

24:19.200 --> 24:23.120
'Dr Westphall. 2233.

24:23.120 --> 24:26.520
'Dr Westphall. 2233.'

24:26.520 --> 24:28.640
Walnut poundcake, your favourite.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.680
Oh, Ma, I don't know if I can.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.360
Oh, you love my cake.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.640
It's got a pound of butter in it,
Ma,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.200
I'm supposed to be on a special diet.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.360
Your supervisor called to see
how you were.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.200
I said much better.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.000
You can't rush things, Ma.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.320
When do you come home?

24:43.320 --> 24:44.640
Soon.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.840
Soon, soon. Soon, soon...

24:47.840 --> 24:49.720
They said you were looking for me?

24:49.720 --> 24:50.800
Hiya, Dr Morrison.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.000
How are you Mrs Keuhnelian?

24:52.000 --> 24:55.800
Oh, fine, now that Joseph is better.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.800
Ma, excuse me a minute?

25:02.920 --> 25:03.960
I can't tell her.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.840
Every time I start talking
about quitting the job,

25:06.840 --> 25:09.600
she changes the subject.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.120
It's OK. Why don't you give me
a few minutes with her?

25:13.120 --> 25:17.120
OK.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.120
Where did Joseph go?

25:19.120 --> 25:20.840
He wants us to have a little chat.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.400
Oh.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.680
Joseph says that you lost your wife.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.920
Last November.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.200
You cook for yourself now?

25:29.200 --> 25:31.600
Well, I do my best.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.600
Dr Morrison,
you have been so good to Joseph,

25:35.600 --> 25:38.000
I don't know what
we would have done.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.320
Well, thank you.

25:39.320 --> 25:43.240
Now it's our turn to thank you,
Linnia and mine.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.920
Please come to dinner tonight.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.560
Well, now, that's very
nice of you, Mrs Keuhnelian.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.600
In your honour,
we'll have lamb with plum sauce.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.760
Joseph loves it.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.080
That sounds terrific.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.720
Oh, it's just I've got to go to
this...this hospital fundraiser.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.800
Oh, I understand.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.920
You go to a fancy dinner rather than
spend time with people like us.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.760
No, no, no, that's not it.

26:04.760 --> 26:08.000
Another night perhaps.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.920
Well, to tell you the truth,

26:09.920 --> 26:11.840
I'm not very good in crowds.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.560
Come tonight at six.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.960
We'll talk over dinner, all right?

26:15.960 --> 26:19.040
I've got to get back to Linnia
and the baby.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.920
You make it hard to say no.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.920
I'm a mother.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.680
We do have to talk.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.040
In our house, a guest is always free
to say what he likes.

26:28.040 --> 26:32.040
I'll see you tonight.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.320
What's going on back there?

26:38.320 --> 26:40.480
You know, I don't really think
I should go tonight.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.960
Ow!

26:41.960 --> 26:43.760
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.560
Don't give me that old excuse.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.680
Oh, there.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.760
Ellen, this thing has got to be
at least two sizes too small.

26:49.760 --> 26:53.760
It isn't the cummerbund
that's changed.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.840
You now, Ehrlich really threw me
for a loop today.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.840
Two weeks into his marriage and
he's already screaming to get out.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.520
Well, he ought to know.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.000
You know, there's one problem
with his whole generation

27:05.000 --> 27:06.160
that I don't understand.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.480
I mean,
they all shack up with each other.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.160
So they know exactly
what they're getting into.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.880
And yet,
the divorce rate is sky high.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.440
Things have changed
since we were married.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.760
Do you remember what a surprise
our wedding night was?

27:19.760 --> 27:22.120
I'd rather not talk about it.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.760
Where the hell is my speech?

27:23.760 --> 27:26.160
Uh, your right-hand breast pocket.

27:26.160 --> 27:30.160
Oh.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.840
"It's particularly gratifying
to receive this award,

27:33.840 --> 27:35.680
"coming as it does from my peers."

27:35.680 --> 27:36.560
Well, that doesn't work.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.600
Well, that doesn't work.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.320
You'd call the Women's Auxiliary
my peers?

27:40.320 --> 27:43.840
Yes.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.400
I just don't want to run too long.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.680
"I would be remiss
if I didn't thank..."

27:48.680 --> 27:50.080
Well, I can't cut that part.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.720
Come on, honey, you'll be thanking
everybody but the gardener.

27:53.720 --> 27:57.200
The gardener, very funny.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.560
Don't forget what happened
at last year's dinner dance.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
You were hyperventilating
all evening.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.400
I have never hyperventilated
in my entire life.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.200
I just got a little excited,
that's all.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.120
And then disappointed.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.560
When they called Donald's name,

28:10.560 --> 28:12.600
you looked
like they'd cancelled Christmas.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.600
Look, the whole idea of Doctor
Of The Year is ridiculous.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.600
I mean, it's one thing to strive
for excellence, it's another to be

28:19.600 --> 28:21.360
in competition with your colleagues.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.920
And then to make it worse, they
leave the voting up to amateurs.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.920
I mean, how can you compare
what I do with say, uh,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.160
what a radiologist does?

28:33.160 --> 28:36.520
If you think the whole idea is so
silly, then why is it so important?

28:36.520 --> 28:39.280
There are some things
you'll just never understand, Ellen.

28:39.280 --> 28:43.280
Why don't you just go warm up
the car for me, huh?

28:50.640 --> 28:53.880
Oh, my God!
Watch it, you could hurt a guy.

28:53.880 --> 28:57.880
Geez, what, somebody moving out?

28:58.720 --> 29:01.760
Hey, wait a minute!

29:01.760 --> 29:02.960
What is going on here?

29:02.960 --> 29:05.240
Some stranger just left
with a load of your hat boxes.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.240
Oh, that's Maurice, our chauffeur.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.680
We don't have a chauffeur.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.880
Oh, not ours, yours and mine,
ours, mine and my parents'.

29:11.880 --> 29:12.720
Where are you going?

29:12.720 --> 29:15.800
Where are you going?

29:15.800 --> 29:18.200
Two of the fondue sets are yours,
I'll keep the others.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.720
I hate fondue.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.920
See? I grew up on fondue.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.320
We are intransigent.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.520
What?

29:24.520 --> 29:25.920
Incorrigible.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.160
Incomparable.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.640
How about incompatible?

29:28.640 --> 29:32.600
You can keep the cheap brandy
snifters from your Aunt Charisse.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.640
Hey, don't start on my aunt, OK?

29:34.640 --> 29:37.040
Why shouldn't
I criticise that old lush?

29:37.040 --> 29:39.280
Why are you so upset?

29:39.280 --> 29:41.960
Oh, ask that big blonde, you know,
the one you are so keen on.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.280
What blonde?

29:43.280 --> 29:46.800
Oh, you know the one, the big blonde
barmaid with the tingling ribs.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.960
Oh, come on, I know what
you are talking about now.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.000
I never laid a finger on her.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.840
The car is fairly full, Ms Sloan.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.120
It's not Ms Sloan, it's Mrs Ehrlich.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.480
Maurice,
see if you can squeeze these in.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.880
Very good, Miss.

29:59.880 --> 30:03.880
Mrs.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.000
Mrs Ehrlich. Thank you.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.360
I'll be right down.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.280
Victor.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.480
We've got to face facts.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.720
We've made a big mistake.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.200
How can you say that?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.080
Now, wait a minute, just let me talk.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.200
Who can stop you?

30:22.200 --> 30:25.480
OK, after all the therapy
and the dates...

30:25.480 --> 30:29.080
Yeah, and how about the honeymoon?

30:29.080 --> 30:31.240
We are not right for one another,
Victor.

30:31.240 --> 30:35.040
I know you've tried, so have I.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.400
Roberta, I really don't know
what to say.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.960
Just goodbye.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.960
I've never been very good
at saying goodbye.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.560
Let me help you down.

30:45.560 --> 30:49.560
Oh, I've got it.

30:51.360 --> 30:55.360
I'll never find
another woman like you!

30:56.520 --> 30:59.760
'Thank God.'

30:59.760 --> 31:02.280
Don't forget Mr Katz's
medication at nine.

31:02.280 --> 31:05.400
Oh, and Mrs Folly will be calling
down every few minutes or so,

31:05.400 --> 31:07.800
but she just wants updates
on Family Feud.

31:07.800 --> 31:11.800
Thanks, Wanda.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.480
Hi.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.160
Hi.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.840
Oh, great dress!

31:17.840 --> 31:20.520
Thanks. I got it for the fundraiser.

31:20.520 --> 31:21.560
I'm on call,

31:21.560 --> 31:23.760
so I get tuna fish on rye

31:23.760 --> 31:25.800
and a postop who thinks
I'm irresistible.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.040
Oh, how old?

31:27.040 --> 31:28.720
83.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.000
Lucky you(!)

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
I want a full report on the winner.
I've got five dollars on Craig.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.200
Night, Jacqueline.

31:35.200 --> 31:39.200
Night, Jacqueline.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.520
Hey, Wendy.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.800
What do you want?

32:00.800 --> 32:01.840
Nothing.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.760
Well, I'd like a little privacy,
this is the women's locker room.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.200
I know.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.560
Well then, get out of here!

32:08.560 --> 32:10.760
Now, don't tell me what to do.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.080
When are you going
to learn to grow up?

32:13.080 --> 32:14.560
You going to teach me?

32:14.560 --> 32:17.120
You are always coming down on me,

32:17.120 --> 32:21.120
playing little Miss Know It All,
Miss Hostile.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.280
And all along this is
what you really wanted.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.320
You're crazy!

32:25.320 --> 32:29.320
Am I?

32:31.280 --> 32:33.200
(SCREAMS)

32:33.200 --> 32:34.720
Help!  Take her to her room. Come on.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.760
Help!

32:35.760 --> 32:36.800
Open the door!

32:36.800 --> 32:37.840
Help!

32:37.840 --> 32:40.360
Call security!
On the count of three, all right?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.960
Ready? One, two, three.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.800
Peter, what the hell?

32:44.800 --> 32:48.800
Take it easy!

32:53.120 --> 32:57.120
(SOBS)

33:04.120 --> 33:06.120
Now, tell me
about the heart transplant,

33:06.120 --> 33:08.560
Doctor, from beginning to end.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.600
I'd really rather not.

33:09.600 --> 33:13.600
Arthur thinks you ought to write
a book, don't you, dear?

33:14.080 --> 33:15.120
A book?

33:15.120 --> 33:16.520
Mark doesn't have time.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.880
Well, there's always weekends.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.880
Hello.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.400
You're right here next to me,
Dr Auschlander.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.800
Is Katherine parking the car?

33:24.800 --> 33:28.800
No, I'm afraid she has come down
with a touch of the flu.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.040
This is quite a turnout.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.040
Yeah. You know, I heard
they barely broke even last year.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.520
Said they printed
the wrong dates on the tickets.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.040
Where is everyone at our table?

33:42.040 --> 33:46.040
Victor and Roberta should be here.
Dr Armstrong should be coming, too.

33:46.120 --> 33:50.120
Phil, let's dance.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.840
Well, we just got here.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.160
What are you talking about?

33:54.160 --> 33:57.200
Sajala wonders
if the band takes requests.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.960
What does she want to hear?

33:58.960 --> 34:00.480
Song Of The Ganges Harvest.

34:00.480 --> 34:04.480
&lt; Excuse me.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.360
Hello, Helen.

34:08.360 --> 34:09.120
Hi.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.440
Hi.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.960
Oh, he's home with the flu, poor guy.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.000
There's a lot of that going around.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.520
Now, you dig in.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.679
Before you know it,
we'll be announcing

34:18.679 --> 34:22.679
the Women's Auxiliary's choice
of Doctor Of The Year 1984.

34:23.679 --> 34:24.920
Terrific.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.560
The tension is killing me.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.400
Easy to joke
when you're not in the running.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.840
Oh, the Syfords and the Farnsworths.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.719
They shouldn't be seated
at the same table.

34:33.719 --> 34:36.120
They fight about the nuclear freeze.

34:36.120 --> 34:39.080
Come along, dear,
you're good at diplomacy.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.280
And I always thought
he was good for nothing.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.360
Good evening.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.719
Hi. Where's Caldwell?

34:44.719 --> 34:46.159
He's got the flu.

34:46.159 --> 34:49.080
BEEPING

34:49.080 --> 34:50.560
I thought it was your night off.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.360
You and me both.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.480
I told them not to call
unless it's an emergency.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.679
You're going to miss
the Man Of The Year Award.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.600
Well, I'll try and get back
for the big event.

34:58.600 --> 35:02.600
Have a good time.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.440
Dinner was delicious.

35:14.440 --> 35:17.400
You make Linnia feel happy,
that's good for her.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.800
She doesn't get out enough.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.440
Well, that's tough with a baby.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.400
Mrs Keuhnelian...

35:24.400 --> 35:26.400
You promised we'd talk about Joseph.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.080
Yes, I know, I know.

35:28.080 --> 35:31.520
The attacks he has been having
are part of a larger problem.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.200
Ah, tea.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.880
It's his arteries.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.760
Especially the one that goes
to the brain,

35:37.760 --> 35:41.760
that's what's causing the blackouts.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.400
It's not fatal,

35:44.400 --> 35:46.600
but he's got to make changes
in his way of life.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.520
What kind of changes?

35:48.520 --> 35:51.760
Well, diet,
cutting out smoking

35:51.760 --> 35:54.040
and, uh...

35:54.040 --> 35:55.720
He can't work construction any more.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.560
&lt; It's just too dangerous.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.280
My God!

36:00.280 --> 36:02.760
He can do other things, Mama.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.520
That pay nothing.

36:04.520 --> 36:07.520
I don't believe
this is happening to us.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.840
Are you sure?

36:08.840 --> 36:10.120
Uh-huh.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.120
Then, how do we survive?

36:12.120 --> 36:13.880
I'll get a job.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.360
What can you do, Linnia?

36:15.360 --> 36:16.920
You never worked and there's a baby.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.280
Well, there are day care centres.
Pete goes to one three times a week.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.920
No, that's not right.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.440
Children should be brought
up in the home, with a mother.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.920
Well, Mrs Keuhnelian, the city
has several agencies, which help

36:27.920 --> 36:30.440
families that are in your situation.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.280
No welfare. &gt;

36:32.280 --> 36:36.280
There's no bigger insult for a man
than to see his family beg.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.360
If you had died
and your wife had lived,

36:39.360 --> 36:42.240
do you think she would have insulted
your memory with handouts?

36:42.240 --> 36:44.280
I couldn't do that to my husband &gt;

36:44.280 --> 36:48.280
and I can't do that to my son.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.880
Thank you, thank you all.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.000
For a moment I thought I had won.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.280
Get on with it, lady!

37:23.280 --> 37:24.560
And now...

37:24.560 --> 37:27.480
for the event that you've all been
looking forward to.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.920
Mrs Jesmer, break dancing.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.120
(LAUGH)

37:31.120 --> 37:34.400
The clarification of the selection
process for choosing

37:34.400 --> 37:35.720
Doctor Of The Year.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.680
Oh, for crying out loud!

37:38.680 --> 37:41.000
Now, all 100 members

37:41.000 --> 37:44.760
of the Women's Auxiliary
received ballots in the mail.

37:44.760 --> 37:48.040
Now, they've alphabetically listed
every doctor who works

37:48.040 --> 37:50.080
at St Eligius.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.520
Then, they rank the favourites

37:53.520 --> 37:57.280
and the top five are reviewed
by a blue ribbon panel,

37:57.280 --> 38:00.480
who,
after very careful deliberation,

38:00.480 --> 38:03.360
choose the Doctor Of The Year.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.440
What did I tell you? Amateurs.

38:06.440 --> 38:07.560
If you recall,

38:07.560 --> 38:11.560
last year's winner was
the St Eligius Director Of Medicine,

38:12.120 --> 38:13.560
Dr Westphall.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.160
Dr Westphall, would you take a bow?

38:15.160 --> 38:16.200
He's not here,

38:16.200 --> 38:19.720
he had to go to the hospital
on emergency.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.920
Oh, dear. This is awkward.

38:21.920 --> 38:25.920
Well, I guess I, uh...

38:27.960 --> 38:31.720
"For meritory service,
irreproachable conduct,

38:31.720 --> 38:35.240
"humanitarianism
beyond the call of duty

38:35.240 --> 38:39.040
"and for transplanting
the level of medical care,

38:39.040 --> 38:42.920
"St Eligius Hospital, Boston,
Massachusetts,

38:42.920 --> 38:46.920
"Doctor Of The Year 1984,

38:47.760 --> 38:51.760
"Dr Donald Westphall."

38:53.640 --> 38:55.600
Two years running!

38:55.600 --> 38:57.720
Relax, Mark, that speech will keep.

38:57.720 --> 38:58.960
Dr Craig,

38:58.960 --> 39:01.840
as a good friend of Dr Westphall's,

39:01.840 --> 39:04.280
perhaps you would come accept
the award for him.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.640
Actually, I couldn't po...

39:06.640 --> 39:08.280
Do it, Mark.

39:08.280 --> 39:12.280
Go ahead, Mark, give 'em hell. &gt;

39:24.680 --> 39:26.720
At least you could have had
it laminated.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.800
(LAUGHS)

39:28.800 --> 39:30.720
Um...

39:30.720 --> 39:34.720
I know that if Donald were here,
he'd be thrilled.

39:36.040 --> 39:40.040
To be selected Doctor Of The Year...

39:41.920 --> 39:44.640
..once is an honour,

39:44.640 --> 39:48.360
to receive it twice running is,
uh...

39:48.360 --> 39:51.520
unbelievable.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.480
But, um...

39:54.480 --> 39:58.240
..that tells you something
about the man.

39:58.240 --> 40:02.240
Dr Westphall runs St Eligius
with efficiency, with humour.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.320
He's not just a fine doctor,
he's a fine human being.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.680
When you think about it,

40:15.680 --> 40:19.680
he's not here to receive this award
himself because he was needed.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.760
If there's better evidence

40:24.760 --> 40:27.560
that he's the one
that deserves this award,

40:27.560 --> 40:31.560
well, I can't think of any.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.800
To Donald Westphall.

40:51.560 --> 40:55.560
'Dr Albert, ICU.
Dr Marilyn Albert, ICU.'

41:05.960 --> 41:07.000
Joe.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.440
Doc?

41:08.440 --> 41:10.920
Yeah.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.080
I had a great dinner
at your mother's.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.720
I told her all about your situation.

41:16.720 --> 41:20.720
On the whole, I don't know,
I guess it went pretty...

41:21.720 --> 41:24.560
Here, hold onto me.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.680
Hold onto me. Got me?

41:26.680 --> 41:29.600
All right, take it easy, sit back.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.160
Got it?

41:32.160 --> 41:36.160
All right.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.160
Now look at me. Look at me.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.800
How long have you been like this?

41:41.800 --> 41:45.800
I don't know...how long a time.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.040
This is it, Doc?

41:49.040 --> 41:52.440
Am I going to see again?

41:52.440 --> 41:55.600
Lie still. Lie still.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.720
I don't care.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.400
Just lie still.

41:57.400 --> 41:58.480
Just lie still.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.520
These attacks last 30 minutes
at the most.

42:00.520 --> 42:04.520
I hope it goes forever.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.880
It's OK. It's all over.

42:40.440 --> 42:44.440
Mind if I sit?

42:56.400 --> 43:00.400
(SOBS)

43:02.840 --> 43:04.000
I'll get 12.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
OK, I'll get 11.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.080
Yeah, I'll stack the tray.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.520
What are you doing here?

43:13.520 --> 43:17.520
We got to talk.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.760
Sorry I was so...stubborn
this morning.

43:24.880 --> 43:27.560
That wasn't stubborn,
that was pigheaded.

43:27.560 --> 43:31.480
Yeah?
What would you call yourself then?

43:31.480 --> 43:34.560
Pushy, opinionated, self-righteous.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.760
About covers it.

43:37.760 --> 43:39.280
Joan, I got to ask you something...

43:39.280 --> 43:41.120
&lt; Dr Caldwell!

43:41.120 --> 43:43.080
What a surprise.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.800
We thought you had the flu.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.320
No, we had a fight.

43:48.320 --> 43:51.640
Bobby,
what was it you wanted to say?

43:51.640 --> 43:53.960
Well...

43:53.960 --> 43:57.960
Oh, don't mind us. Go right ahead.

43:59.840 --> 44:03.280
Do you want to dance?

44:03.280 --> 44:04.320
Dance?

44:04.320 --> 44:08.200
Oh, what a shame,
I think the orchestra is packing up.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.240
Bobby, you must be feeling better.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.520
This is Sajala.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.800
Hi, how are you? Joan, listen...

44:14.800 --> 44:17.160
Not too well, she thinks
she is coming down with the flu.

44:17.160 --> 44:21.160
Bobby, go ahead, sweetheart,
what was the question?

44:21.680 --> 44:25.680
Dr Caldwell is going to ask
Ms Halloran an important question.

44:32.600 --> 44:36.600
Who won?

44:44.680 --> 44:47.640
Pete. Peter...

44:47.640 --> 44:51.640
Fine.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.960
Vroom, Vroom.

45:06.960 --> 45:10.960
Are you tired?
Are you getting tired?

45:12.080 --> 45:16.080
(CHILD CRIES)

45:18.360 --> 45:22.360
(CHILD CRIES)

45:25.440 --> 45:26.680
Hi, Dr Westphall.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.720
Mira.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.000
Peter's on call.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.800
Yeah, I know. May I come in?

45:30.800 --> 45:31.920
Oh, sure.

45:31.920 --> 45:35.920
Mommy...

45:59.400 --> 46:14.000
