-All right.
-All right, talk to me.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.598
So I looked over those stock tips
you emailed me.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.310
And after hearing you talk on Glazer's show,
it got me wondering,

04:36.401 --> 04:37.641
where the fuck is my money at?

04:37.736 --> 04:40.273
That's very smart, Sizz. We wish more players
would ask that question.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.321
Besides the half a mil
I got stashed behind my bedroom wall,

04:43.408 --> 04:45.273
I realized I have no fucking clue.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.620
I'm guessing that's not the first time
you've let that info slip,

04:47.704 --> 04:50.571
so I'm gonna suggest
you move that cash ASAP.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.075
Joe's right, take it out of your wall.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.284
Point is, when I ask Andre about it,
he ain't got no answers for me.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.745
All he want to talk about is how much cash
his golf and tennis tournaments bring in.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.796
Do I look like I give a fuck
about golf or tennis?

05:00.884 --> 05:03.296
-No, you do not.
-I love golf and tennis.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.008
Man, Andre's full of shit, and I don't
even think he really believes in me anymore.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.180
So he doesn't believe
that you can make it back after this injury,

05:09.267 --> 05:10.677
-get back on the field, huh?
-Exactly.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.010
But you've done it before.
You've come back better.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.093
Right?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.312
Don't mean I can do it again.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.482
Hey, you can do it again.
You're gonna do it again.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.729
SPENCER: You know why?
You got an iron will.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.482
When it's all said and done, Sizz,
you're gonna go down

05:22.572 --> 05:24.733
as one of the greatest linebackers of all time.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.658
Now, Joe and l have complete confidence
that you're gonna get another contract,

05:27.744 --> 05:28.904
a better contract.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.700
But, you know,
there are no guarantees in life, right?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.374
Sizz, you ready to make a change?

05:37.462 --> 05:40.670
Shit, it feels like it, but Andre
always got a way of talking me out of shit.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.419
I mean, we're not trying
to force you into anything.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.001
Hey, you know what?

05:46.096 --> 05:48.052
-Let me talk to him for a second outside.
-Yeah.

05:48.139 --> 05:51.131
In the meantime, enjoy the chips.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.648
-What the fuck are you doing?
-What the fuck are you doing?

06:00.735 --> 06:03.112
You really want to start poaching clients
and pick a fight with Andre?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.528
All I care about is Sizzle
and making sure that his needs get met.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.152
Right now, by the way, our client list
is not cutting it with the old man.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.451
We need to be proactive.
If a fight is what we get, so be it.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.030
Virginia, baby, when you get a chance, can
you bring me in some hot sauce, please?

06:15.125 --> 06:17.286
I'm not your damn assistant, Sizzle.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.163
Get your own damn hot sauce.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.915
I got it, Sizz. I'll bring you some hot sauce.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.793
-Good man, Joe.
-All right.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.170
We got to clear this with the old man first.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.217
I'm not clearing it with the old man.
This is my division.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.011
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna go back in there

06:30.098 --> 06:31.759
and we're gonna close the deal, done.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.135
Hey, hey, hey.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.718
In this world, you don'tjust chop block
the biggest guy on the line,

06:36.813 --> 06:39.179
especially when we're not
cleared by the league yet.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.482
I say we play it clean
until we're officially registered

06:42.569 --> 06:45.527
and then we can just chase
after Sizz and whoever the fuck else we want.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.979
-Hey, Joe.
-What's up, Keith?

06:48.283 --> 06:51.070
We walk away now,
Sizz puts it on the streets that we pussied out.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.823
You think I give a shit about that?
I've been called a pussy my whole life.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.825
Yeah, I'm sure you have,
but it's not gonna start with me now.

-You're a pussy.
-Watch it.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.991
Don't worry, you get used to it with time.
You're a pussy.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.747
-Don't do that.
-Pussy. You fucking pussy.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.669
-See, you're starting to get numb to it. Pussy.
-Don't do it.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.746

-Fuckin' A.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.548

tell him you're making a change.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.928
Yeah, all right.

07:16.019 --> 07:19.477

but, you know, fuck it.

-Wow. Way to dig in on his ass.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.796
Shit, it seemed kind of cold-blooded, man.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.677
I didn't want to do this shit over the phone.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.508
Be better to do it tomorrow in person.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.343

-You've got to get out more, Jim.
-Amen.

08:23.753 --> 08:28.463
Listen, um, I was hoping we could discuss
the Mitch situation.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.040
Oh, he's blending in well.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.467
Did a very good job
with the Alonzo Cooley signing.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.044
Thank you for being so gracious.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.597
Well, actually, I was a little confused as to...

08:37.684 --> 08:38.969
Hey, what's up with the Ricky Jerret thing?

08:39.227 --> 08:43.140
Uh, right now there is no Ricky Jerret thing.
He's a free agent.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.313
Cooley signed a big contract,
so if Jerret leaves town,

08:45.400 --> 08:47.311
I want to be the first to break where he lands.

08:47.402 --> 08:50.394
You've got sources.
He and Spencer Strasmore are tight.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.524
Okay, we got off track here, Jim.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.448
I'm just saying that Jerret sounds
like a very compelling story

08:55.535 --> 08:57.241
on which you happen to have pole position.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.786
Completely accidental pun.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.080
(LAUGHS)

09:02.292 --> 09:04.704
Well, you want that story, put Mitch on it.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.206
Make him earn the extra 20 grand you pay him.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.412
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.714
I came here to discuss equal pay
and you're sitting here asking me

09:11.801 --> 09:14.008
to use a personal relationship
to hook a story?

09:14.095 --> 09:16.632
-l'm notjudging, Legs.
-Call me Tracy.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.930
-Oh, come on.
-ls that too much to ask?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.973
Don't tell me you've lost your sense of humor.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.766
What happened to the queen of the double
entendre that | used to know and love?

09:27.025 --> 09:31.815
She told you to go get pole position
on your new bitch, Mitch

09:31.905 --> 09:32.985
and then she quit.

There's no way that hurt you.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.435
-Preps you for the pain.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.683
You should look into taking up
paddle-boarding or something.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.226
-What'd Siefert say?
-He claims his hands are tied.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.060
Things seem really fucked up over there.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.318
Tell me about it. I can't even get a call
about OTAs and my deal's already set.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.567
A lack of gratitude
speaks volumes about a man.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.745
-That's a good Siefert.
-Morgan Freeman channeling motherfucker.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.247
(LAUGHS) They just don't see
the market the way we do.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.290
-They claim they don't have any money.
-I want what I deserve.

10:28.378 --> 10:29.618
And if I got to go elsewhere, I will.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.168
You talking about money or respect, though?

10:31.256 --> 10:33.292
-In this game, it's the same thing.
-You want to get paid.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.420
I promise you we're gonna get you paid.
Jason's all over it. So am I.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.047
You have my word.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.550
All right. So what about me?

10:41.224 --> 10:43.215
I'm gonna set you up with Coach Berg, okay?

10:43.893 --> 10:49.354
And you buy the man a couple of beers,
and he's gonna give you the truth, all right?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.226
(GROANS) I'll call him today.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.441
That's the plan?

10:53.528 --> 10:56.235
If you were Vernon,
how much would you pay me?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.062
What do you mean, like a salary?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.819
Yeah, let's say weekly.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.868
Oh, I don't know.
Let's run those numbers, huh?

11:08.835 --> 11:11.668
Urn, nothing.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.667
-(SCOFFS) Nothing?
-Yeah, you heard me. Nothing.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.591
If I could pay you less than nothing,
I'd pay you that.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.839
You have no idea
of all the stuff I do for Vernon.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.421
Exactly right.
That's why I would pay you less than nothing.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.757
You should pay me to hang out.

11:26.853 --> 11:31.313
I provide food, females,
travel, fun, cars, parties.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.105
What the fuck do you provide?

11:33.902 --> 11:37.019
Okay. Okay, so this is like a role-play thing.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.069
For me it is. You're playing yourself.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.445
Okay, I'm your main motivator.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.777
Okay? I advise you on contracts.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.533
-Mmm-hmm.
-Schedule training.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.327
Coordinate leisure activities.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.785
Just last week I massaged
that fucking groin muscle you tweaked.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.293
Hmm? And I provide a buffer between you

11:57.383 --> 12:00.500
and that slippery bald white guy that
always carrying Spencer's jockstrap.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.211
Joe? He's actually a really smart guy.

12:03.306 --> 12:07.265
All right, listen, Joe,

12:07.352 --> 12:09.513
I'm 24 years old, okay?

12:09.604 --> 12:11.686
I drove here in a $400,000 Rolls,

12:12.148 --> 12:14.434
and I don't even have a checking account.

12:14.525 --> 12:20.361
ljust want enough to get my own place
and not have to get permission to have shit.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.319
Is that too much to ask?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.370
How's 1,500 a week sound?

-Mmm-hmm.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.670

Nope. Just me and you.

-A little loud.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.561
Mmm.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.274
You okay?

12:58.361 --> 13:01.774
I went to talk to my boss
about the whole salary thing,

13:02.198 --> 13:06.532
and he started cracking jokes,
so I lit him up and I quit.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.988
(LAUGHS)

13:08.246 --> 13:10.612
Fuck it.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.410
(SIGHS) Shit, I feel like an ass.

13:13.501 --> 13:18.666
You know what? For four fucking years,
I laughed at their horrible jokes

13:18.756 --> 13:22.669
and I played their game perfectly
and they still paid Mitch more.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.752
Shitty-ass, weasel-faced fuck.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.429
You want me to go to his office
tomorrow morning, smack him around?

-|'|| do it.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.678
I mean, Iwill fuck him up.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.509
No, I'll be fine.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.344
-No?
-Thank you.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.184
Hey, Trace, I'm sorry.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.485
I never meant for this to happen.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.063
It's not your fault.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.117

I'm working out. Can we make this quick?

14:50.098 --> 14:51.804

We're supposed to talk later today.
Shit's complicated.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.929
-He’s important to you, right?
-Yeah.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.136
-You want to keep him around?
-Word, that’s my bro.

-This isn't a friendship thing, Vern.
-I rely on him, Joe.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.974
Put him on the payroll. It’s not gonna put
a dent in your bank account.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.311
Gives him a sense of worth
and clears you of any liability.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.647
If he fucks up in the future,
you can just cut bait.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.402
-How much you think he should get?
-I don't know.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.906

15:14.539 --> 15:15.528

15:15.623 --> 15:16.863
I'm gonna assume that's a yes.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.041
Yes, Joseph. That's a yes.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.914
All right, big man.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.671
Hey, I really appreciate
you seeing me at such short notice, Doc.

How much are you taking, Spencer?

15:44.735 --> 15:47.477
A couple pills a day.
Just when the pain flares up.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.358
So two a day?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.821
Give or take.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.239
If it were two a day,
you wouldn't need to refill this frequently.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.580

15:59.917 --> 16:01.578

-I'm not abusing.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.355
and ljust need something
to ease the pain, that's all.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.225
How did you injure it?

16:30.823 --> 16:31.983
Tennis.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.157
Yeah, I got real aggressive
on my backhand volley.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.233
Old habit.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.320
-Did you come in and see someone about it?
-For a tennis injury?

16:38.414 --> 16:41.030
No. Come on, Doc. I'm a football player.
(LAUGHS)

16:41.125 --> 16:44.037
I can't have that shit out in the streets.
I got a rep to protect.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.665
Plus I'm a man of pride. You know that.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.048
I'm not comfortable writing
any more prescriptions for you, Spencer.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.127
I'm in pain pretty much all the fucking time.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.885
And the medication and myjob
are the only things that keep my mind off it.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.593
So if you could just write me
a scrip this one time,

17:01.687 --> 17:04.804
so I can go back to work
and I can finally put this stabbing sensation

17:04.899 --> 17:10.690

to rest just for a while.

Your one condition is to have a full
examination within the next 10 days.

-That's right.
-Until that happens

17:30.967 --> 17:34.255
and we fix the problem,
no more medication from me, Spencer.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.712
Yeah, no, I got it. No more from you,
10 days, we're gonna fix the problem.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.889
-But we're gonna do it together.
-I'm serious.

moving me to right tackle?

21:21.864 --> 21:23.024
I'm not moving you.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.028
I'm asking you to do something
very, very, very few athletes could do.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.202
Charles, this is a real opportunity for you
and it's your choice.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.576
You either go onto the right side
or you go back home

21:33.667 --> 21:35.828
and it's SportsCenter
with your dick in your left hand

21:35.920 --> 21:37.535
and a big old jug of Kaopectate
in your right hand.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.619
Now you want another round?

21:40.216 --> 21:41.706
Yeah.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.882
Charlie, two.

around this many white people these days.

SPENCER: (LAUGHS) You got soul now, Joe.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.785
Hope they have a buffet. I'm starving.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.373
Hey, I love your confidence, man,

22:13.457 --> 22:15.698
and I want to build this division
as badly as you do,

22:15.793 --> 22:19.251
but Miami Wealth is on a whole other level.

22:19.338 --> 22:23.377
I mean, they've got money to burn,
resources we don't have, you know?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.254
They're the top firm in Miami.

22:26.345 --> 22:30.338
Maybe we should ask ourselves
one more time,

22:30.432 --> 22:34.641
just take a quick moment to ask ourselves
if we should be doing this.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.851
Okay.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.262
(SIGHS)

22:39.775 --> 22:41.481
Yes.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.400
-Get our tickets.
-Not as quick.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.569
Let's do another one, but not as quick.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.988
Thousand bucks
I don't fit in this beautiful Pagani.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.064
I'II double that.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.946
The two tickets under Terrell Suggs, please.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.156
-All right.
-Are you Vin Diesel?

22:57.877 --> 23:00.038
No, I'm bigger and better-looking.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.495
Come on, Vin, don't mess with the kid.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.296
Yes, this is Vin Diesel.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.508
-I'm Bruce Willis, actually. Yeah. Thank you.

JOE: Do you hear the noises she's making
when she hits the ball?

23:12.808 --> 23:14.890
I'd fuck her. I'd fuck her, too.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.935
This game is so sexual, huh?

23:18.022 --> 23:20.889
I'd do both of them. I love tennis now.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.473
Shit.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.524
Hey, Joe.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.979
I need you to do something for me.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.485
I'm sorry, giving you life after football
wasn't enough?

23:30.576 --> 23:32.737
I need you to clock me.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.111
Get the fuck out of here.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.366
No, no, no, I'm serious. It's my pregame ritual.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.994
Helps kill the butterflies.
I need you to clock me.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.665
Now you're nervous?

23:40.753 --> 23:44.291
No, itjust gets the competitivejuices... Oh!

23:44.381 --> 23:47.919
I assumed you wanted open hand.
I mean, I can ball it up for you if you want.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.796
-That's quite enough.
-Sandwich style.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.798
-No sandwich.
-All right.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.473
Buddy, there's something else
I got to tell you.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.847
You and Andre were lovers. I fucking knew it.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.225
No, no, but we do have history.

24:02.316 --> 24:07.026
He mismanaged my money
and we had a really bad breakup.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.692
So is this personal or is this business?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.320
It's a little bit of both.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.700
You want to hit me again?

24:17.665 --> 24:20.998
-No, let's go do this.
-My man.

Mr. Allen is right over there.

Ah, the Sizzle boys brought the weather.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.303
-Hello.
-This is Caroline Wozniacki, of course.

25:20.394 --> 25:21.349
Sure.

25:21.437 --> 25:24.600
This is the main reason I wanted to be
in the tennis business right here.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.806
As you know, we started
the Biscayne Open together years ago.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.606
Yeah, he seems to forget it was my idea,

25:28.694 --> 25:30.980
especially while he was negotiating
my appearance fee.

25:31.071 --> 25:34.029
-Sounds like a classic conflict of interest.
-No, I don't think so.

25:34.116 --> 25:36.277
If you look at her earning statement,
there's zero conflict.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.526
If you want to hit some balls sometime,
let me know.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.905
I'll be in touch.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.737
Bye.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.572
-Want to sit down?
-SPENCER: Yeah.

25:43.667 --> 25:49.162
Listen, I read in the paper
that Anderson had moved shop recently.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.211
Yeah, only our division.

25:50.299 --> 25:53.041
Yeah, we're at the Related now
down by the river mouth.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.091
Oh, yes. I got some properties down here.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.885
That's nice and quaint there
at the mouth of the river.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.473
-Champagne?
-I'm good, thank you.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.593
I'll take his.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.391
Okay, let's cut to the chase.
Let's talk about The Sizz.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.219
It's just Sizz, actually.

26:05.314 --> 26:09.353
Well, I like to call him "The Sizz"
because I like to personalize things.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.609
Yeah, me, too. I call him "The Spence."
Hates it.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.813
Yeah, well, The Sizz, he's one of my most
important football clients.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.488
We are doing some very important
business deals, so I'd be very careful.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.778
Well, Sizz says he feels neglected.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.285
(LAUGHS) So does my wife.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.752
So I will tell you and The Sizz what I tell her.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.087
I've got a lot of things going on.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.583
Obviously. We know that.
I mean, this place is sweet.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.082
Listen, I know you guys got this little Frick
and Frack thing going on with the players.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.964
You got the good-times approach to them.
You got the wild parties.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.592
You know, you're one of the guys,
you're charming, you're up front.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.967
One of you is good-looking.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.265
Please, you're embarrassing me.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.217
But here's the deal.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.686
I don't have a lot of love for guys

26:51.777 --> 26:55.065
who want to waltz into my backyard
and hang a shingle.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.818
I mean, I've been doing this thing for 20 years
and you've been doing, what, 20 minutes,

26:58.909 --> 27:01.070
and you think you're gonna
steal one of my clients?

27:01.161 --> 27:03.243
I don't lose clients. I don't lose, period.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.616
So The Sizz stays where he is.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.289
Well, maybe we can call Sizz now,
see what he thinks.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.619
He doesn't know what he thinks.
He's a football player.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.879
You sound very worried, Andre.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.424
Maybe you don't understand
your clients as well as you think you do.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.635
Maybe they need somebody who does.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.807
No, what they need
is someone to protect and grow their money.

27:25.894 --> 27:29.386
So if they think you're the guy for that,
you and I both know, rather clearly,

27:29.481 --> 27:31.893
that they're gonna be deeply disappointed.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.856
Okay.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.901
Well, thanks so much for your time.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.280
And on behalf of Sizz
and all the other football players out there,

27:43.370 --> 27:45.110
you're fucking fired.
