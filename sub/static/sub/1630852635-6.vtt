[man whistles]

00:13.666 --> 00:15.041
Quiet back there.

00:15.125 --> 00:15.958
[man 1 whistles]

00:16.041 --> 00:18.291
[sighs]
Deaf and mute.

00:18.375 --> 00:20.708
-[man 1 whistles]
-[driver] Quiet!

00:20.791 --> 00:22.041
One more time,

00:22.125 --> 00:24.500
-and you'll feel my boot up your--
-[loud roar]

00:24.583 --> 00:26.333
-[crashes]
-[all scream]

00:26.416 --> 00:28.500
[indistinct chatter]

00:29.083 --> 00:31.583
[guard 1] Gods' mercy! Kill it!

00:31.666 --> 00:33.041
[people grunting]

00:33.833 --> 00:34.833
[loud roar]

00:34.916 --> 00:36.541
-[guard 1] Kill it!
-[guard 2] No!

00:36.625 --> 00:38.750
[growling in distance]

00:39.541 --> 00:41.000
Goddess.

00:43.208 --> 00:44.666
[man 1 whistles]

00:45.500 --> 00:46.458
[elves gasp]

00:46.541 --> 00:50.583
[gasps]
Sagan, no. I'm not a snack, you great mop.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.250
[soft growl]

00:53.791 --> 00:58.125
Marci. Thank the God. Thank you.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.625
[groans]

00:59.708 --> 01:00.875
And him?

01:00.958 --> 01:04.583
If I stitch the two of you together,
I can make one healthy person.

01:04.666 --> 01:05.833
-Captain.
-[sighs]

01:05.916 --> 01:09.666
So, you care if I live or die.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.291
A little less all the time.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.958
[man 2] They killed the Emperor!

01:13.041 --> 01:15.208
Get him up. We're leaving.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.208
[theme music playing]

02:09.666 --> 02:11.791
[guard 3 groaning]

02:12.875 --> 02:13.750
[guard 3 grunts]

02:14.333 --> 02:16.250
[groans]
That thing…

02:17.000 --> 02:20.875
It took the Emperor. They've killed him.

02:20.958 --> 02:21.958
You've done your bit.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.750
Whatever that creature is,
it's my problem now.

02:25.375 --> 02:29.041
Sun's valor, Slayer. Sun's my--

02:30.541 --> 02:32.000
Sun's glory.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.750
[Lina] The rear! He's coming in behind us!

02:34.833 --> 02:35.875
[squeals]

02:36.958 --> 02:38.541

-[man 3 groans]

02:41.791 --> 02:43.958
[thrilling music playing]

02:45.500 --> 02:48.041
Whoa!
[gasps]

02:49.041 --> 02:50.416
[man 4] The Slayer.

02:50.958 --> 02:51.916
Fall back!

02:55.125 --> 02:56.375
[grunts]

02:58.041 --> 02:59.083
[man 5] Fly clear!

02:59.166 --> 03:00.833
-[woman 1] Fly clear!
-[woman 2] Fly clear!

03:00.916 --> 03:03.416
[Slyrak] Blaze against the Father of Fire?

03:03.500 --> 03:07.041
You would do better to hurl rocks
at the mountain.

03:07.125 --> 03:11.708
-Davion, you have to listen to me.
-There's no Davion.

03:11.791 --> 03:12.625
[grunts]

03:12.708 --> 03:14.875
-[growls]
-[grunts]

03:16.500 --> 03:17.375
[Lina groans]

03:24.583 --> 03:25.625
[Slyrak breathes heavily]

03:26.375 --> 03:30.708
I have no idea how you came to be,
but I know who you possess.

03:30.791 --> 03:32.208
Davion.

03:32.291 --> 03:35.458
I finally understand
the connection I feel with him.

03:35.541 --> 03:39.958
It's you, isn't it? It's always been you.
You don't belong here.

03:40.041 --> 03:42.166
You need to give Davion back to us.

03:42.250 --> 03:46.708
The mouse has fled. His song fades.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.166
Only I remain.

03:49.750 --> 03:53.375
No. I… I can hear him. See him.

03:53.958 --> 03:57.166
[Lina] He's lost. Frightened. Alone.

03:57.250 --> 04:01.333
[Slyrak] An echo of thunder, nothing more.

04:01.416 --> 04:04.375
[Lina] Davion doesn't want this.
He would never want this.

04:04.458 --> 04:08.416
What a mouse wants is nothing.
What he has is nothing.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.500
You'll give me the Eye.

04:11.583 --> 04:16.500
I won't give you a damned thing,
and I won't let you have him.

04:16.583 --> 04:20.750
There is no distinction.
There is no "you".

04:20.833 --> 04:27.583
You are the child of the fire,
a part of me, and you will obey.

04:27.666 --> 04:30.083
-[roars]
-[Lina grunting]

04:34.000 --> 04:36.333
[Lina groaning]

04:39.541 --> 04:44.500
I am no one's child! I am the fire!
[screams]

04:45.666 --> 04:47.250
[growling]

04:47.333 --> 04:48.500
[grunting]

04:49.000 --> 04:50.666
[growling in pain]

04:50.750 --> 04:54.750
[continues grunting]

04:56.458 --> 04:58.958
[Lina panting]

05:04.041 --> 05:06.166
[Lina] I've always been the fire.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.541
[young Lina whimpering]

05:12.666 --> 05:15.083
Make it stop! Make it stop!

05:15.166 --> 05:16.500
[Davion] Lina?

05:17.875 --> 05:20.958
I'm guessing the Emperor said no,
given you dropped him off a roof.

05:21.041 --> 05:22.583
I… I don't remember.

05:22.666 --> 05:25.250
I remember rage about the Eye, about…

05:25.333 --> 05:28.250
Mirana? I know. I felt it.

05:28.333 --> 05:31.666
I wanted to throw you in the stockade.
A nice concrete pit all on your own

05:31.750 --> 05:34.583
until we could figure out
what to do with you. How to help you.

05:34.666 --> 05:36.208
Viceroy Kashurra disagreed.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.291
-They just let me go free.
-They made you the hero.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.625
Kashurra told everyone
how the creature appeared,

05:41.708 --> 05:44.083
and you, the brave Dragon Knight,
tried to stop it.

05:44.666 --> 05:47.125
It just wouldn't do
if someone so close to the Princess

05:47.208 --> 05:49.041
was tangled up
in the murder of the Emperor.

05:49.125 --> 05:50.541
[Davion] A lie doesn't make it better.

05:50.625 --> 05:53.750
You'd be surprised how much it does
and how much it doesn't.

05:54.583 --> 05:56.958
The Imperium is still in chaos.

05:57.041 --> 06:00.250
The senate will appoint a regent,
but that won't matter.

06:00.333 --> 06:03.291
There is no one all the houses
will rally behind.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.166
Civil war is inevitable.

06:05.250 --> 06:10.000
The things some used to say about me.
All I know how to do is destroy, kill,

06:10.083 --> 06:12.750
and burn things down,
maybe they were right.

06:12.833 --> 06:13.791
You didn't do this.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.416
Stop acting like you know me,
like you know what I've done.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.458
After last night, I think I do.

06:19.541 --> 06:23.333
I was gone forever,
then you pulled me back. You saved me.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.875
You may have saved a lot of people.
I think you can save even more.

06:26.958 --> 06:29.458
I need the Eye.
The Helio Imperium needs a regent.

06:29.541 --> 06:30.375
Davion.

06:30.458 --> 06:34.666
I see how everyone reacts to you.
They love you. You're their hero.

06:34.750 --> 06:39.250
I have no title, a minor house,
and you think they'd name me regent?

06:39.333 --> 06:42.041
[Davion] The people will rally behind you.

06:42.125 --> 06:42.958
[sighs]

06:43.041 --> 06:45.000
Gather around the fire.

06:47.083 --> 06:51.500
Should we shout for the guards,
or do you think the banging is enough?

06:51.583 --> 06:54.625
[Flugg speaking in unknown language]

06:59.583 --> 07:00.500
[groans]

07:01.000 --> 07:04.875
-I must have died. I see angels.
-[groans]

07:04.958 --> 07:06.583
-Bandages.
-[door opens]

07:06.666 --> 07:10.291
This infernal noise disrupts my solitude.

07:10.375 --> 07:15.416
That is the finest silk in the Imperium,
stolen from the palace.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.708
Cheers.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.625
[groaning in pain]

07:18.708 --> 07:19.708
[thuds]

07:24.041 --> 07:24.875
Ahh.

07:24.958 --> 07:28.041
I'm glad you made it,
but it was all for nothing.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.791
[inhales sharply]
Your Princess is dead.

07:35.541 --> 07:38.125
[bells toll in distance]

07:49.583 --> 07:55.333
[Auroth] In repose, not dead but dreaming.
Breathless, still as winter's morn.

07:55.416 --> 08:01.166
The Dawn Star rises, silent,
gleaming elegies of rage forborne.

08:01.250 --> 08:05.708
It's beautiful.
I have no idea what it means.

08:05.791 --> 08:09.083
-How does it make you feel?
-Sad? I think.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.916
[scoffs]
Then you understand perfectly.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
[Bram chuckles]

08:12.083 --> 08:15.291
-And if I'd said it makes me happy?
-[Auroth] Then I would say the same.

08:16.416 --> 08:20.000
Hey, is she supposed to be doing that?

08:22.041 --> 08:24.916
-It's getting worse.
-[Auroth] No, it's something else.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.125
More light, more sun. The windows!

08:28.208 --> 08:29.500
[grunts]

08:30.708 --> 08:33.041
[suspenseful music playing]

08:42.208 --> 08:43.416
[gasps]

08:44.000 --> 08:46.166
[pants]

08:47.875 --> 08:50.000
The Princess rises.

08:52.750 --> 08:57.333
The aura of death is gone,
as if you burned it from your own blood.

08:57.416 --> 09:01.791
You were trapped, Princess,
caught between worlds, living and dead.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.958
I tried to capture your agony in a poem.
Would you like to hear it?

09:05.875 --> 09:07.666
[clicks tongue]
It's pretty good.

09:07.750 --> 09:08.750
[whispers]
She's a dragon.

09:08.833 --> 09:11.291
[in normal voice]
There are 36 stanzas.

09:11.375 --> 09:14.666
Uh… Thank you. Perhaps later.

09:14.750 --> 09:15.916
[door opens, closes]

09:16.500 --> 09:18.583
I'd scarcely allowed myself a hope.

09:18.666 --> 09:22.416
I will inform the Senate
and the War Council.

09:22.500 --> 09:28.000
Hold. Until we identify the assassin,
this event does not leave this room.

09:28.083 --> 09:32.750
-With the Emperor dead…
-I… I'm sorry? With the Emperor, what?

09:32.833 --> 09:35.625
Yeah, I, uh,
I probably should have told you.

09:35.708 --> 09:39.083
He got dropped off a roof
by a half-dragon man.

09:40.041 --> 09:40.958
Splat.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.666
Give us the room.
The Princess and I have a need to talk.

09:50.083 --> 09:54.250
I remember a feeling,
a certain warm serenity

09:54.333 --> 09:56.208
I could have remained inside of forever.

09:56.791 --> 10:02.625
But there was also a voice.
It was gentle, but persistent.

10:02.708 --> 10:07.541
It was my mother's voice,
waking me as though I were a child.

10:07.625 --> 10:11.833
-[Kashurra] And what did your mother say?
-A word. "Remember".

10:11.916 --> 10:18.083
Remember your place. Remember your duty.
Remember you are loved.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.416
-Yes.
-Her admonitions for you as a girl.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.666
I miss her, and Father as well.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.791
Were your parents here,
they would have you claim your throne.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.458
The throne.

10:30.541 --> 10:31.375
[sighs]

10:31.458 --> 10:34.958
It was all so simple
when it was just to be the army.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.416
The Oracle's prophecy
is not yet fulfilled.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.750
Selemene has fallen,
but Mene has yet to rise.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.458
The Elven Empire is still in its infancy.

10:43.541 --> 10:48.041
As Empress, you would command
far more than an army.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.541
But my place would be here.

10:50.625 --> 10:55.541
[Kashurra] So you remember your place,
and you remember your duty.

10:55.625 --> 10:59.333
Yet my mother's final admonition
gives me pause.

10:59.416 --> 11:02.583
[Kashurra] You see those banners?
They honored your father.

11:02.666 --> 11:05.000
Those others, they did not.

11:05.083 --> 11:09.833
But the people beneath the banners,
they were your father's strength.

11:09.916 --> 11:11.500
[Kashurra] They can be yours.

11:11.583 --> 11:15.333
You mean to say I should make
the people love me.

11:15.416 --> 11:17.875
[Kashurra] You should be who you are.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.375
The Senate selects a regent today.

11:21.458 --> 11:25.458
I prefer we name our Empress.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.666
I remember my duty.

11:29.458 --> 11:32.375
[footsteps thudding]

11:32.458 --> 11:35.208
[somber music playing]

11:38.041 --> 11:39.291
[sobs]

11:58.375 --> 12:01.500
-Let me help.
-Oh, thank you, child.

12:01.583 --> 12:04.708
[Fymryn] You shouldn't be out alone.
Not this close to the Shadow Terrace.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.875
The Shadow Terrace. Is that where I am?

12:07.958 --> 12:10.041
Here. Sit with me.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.875
It used to be I didn't need my eyes
to wander these woods,

12:14.958 --> 12:17.250
but things have changed.

12:18.291 --> 12:23.500
-Oh, yes, they've changed so much.
-I hardly recognize it here.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.083
I hardly recognize my own home.

12:26.916 --> 12:30.166
Not the same without our family.

12:30.250 --> 12:35.833
Dyfed, Adara, Idwal.
Oh, I'm sure you miss them horribly.

12:35.916 --> 12:37.166
You knew them?

12:37.250 --> 12:43.416
Everyone knew them. How they loved you.
They would follow you everywhere.

12:44.166 --> 12:50.083
Even to their death.
Everyone knew it was your fault.

12:50.583 --> 12:55.666
There's a way it could go back, you know.
What would you do for that?

12:55.750 --> 12:58.250
Anything. I would do anything.

12:58.333 --> 13:02.875
Come to me, child. Fymryn. Closer.

13:02.958 --> 13:09.625
[Terrorblade] It's easy.
All you have to do is let me in.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.500
[Terrorblade]
You put your faith in a liar.

13:15.583 --> 13:18.041
He used you to take his revenge.

13:18.125 --> 13:23.500
He will always lie. Always use you.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.041
Deny his lies.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.166
-Deny him.
-[gasps]

13:31.708 --> 13:34.041
[breathes heavily]

13:38.666 --> 13:43.333
You cannot march your private legion
into the city flying a house banner.

13:43.416 --> 13:46.791
You assert an authority you lack.

13:46.875 --> 13:52.166
Zal is gone, Shabarra is dead,
but the law remains.

13:52.250 --> 13:58.583
The Imperium needs leadership, strength.
My name and my legion can provide it.

13:58.666 --> 14:02.375
Provide it then,
from the other side of the river.

14:02.458 --> 14:06.625
These men and women are citizens
on their way to a public meeting.

14:06.708 --> 14:08.375
As is she.

14:14.625 --> 14:18.333
-Power is not a game.
-I want to go home.

14:18.416 --> 14:21.500
You have burned seven homes
in seven years.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.416
This is your home now.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.166
The Temple of the Sun
will turn your chaos to order,

14:27.250 --> 14:30.958
your weakness to strength.
We will save you.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.041
This is a prison.

14:33.125 --> 14:36.125
You think I'm just a little girl
who might burn down the world.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.958
I can be a warrior, a protector.

14:39.041 --> 14:42.208
You have nothing to teach me.
I've had enough of this place.

14:42.291 --> 14:45.791
You are a weapon.
Destruction without guidance.

14:45.875 --> 14:48.541
I fear that's all you'll ever be.

14:48.625 --> 14:53.375
You have no idea who I am.
No one does. No one ever will.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.375
[Lina] They're going to kill each other.

14:58.458 --> 15:01.458
I'm sure they want to.
I'm sure they think it's worth it.

15:01.541 --> 15:03.291
I used to have such dreams.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.375
I used to think how much better things
would be with no Emperor,

15:06.458 --> 15:09.250
no royal family, a Helio Republic.

15:09.958 --> 15:12.083
I thought if only Shabarra
would step down,

15:12.166 --> 15:15.333
maybe the Senate would take control
and turn this into a better place,

15:15.416 --> 15:17.291
a fairer place. But now?

15:17.375 --> 15:21.625
[Lina] Tihomir's legion is in the streets.
The Praetorian Guard is ready to fight,

15:21.708 --> 15:24.208
but the Senate
will name her Regent anyway.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.875
They're afraid of her.
They like her money too much.

15:27.958 --> 15:31.000
Then I guess it's just a question
of what you plan to do about it.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.791
I won't watch another home burn.

15:36.375 --> 15:39.000
[Tihomir] The Imperium is in grave peril.

15:39.833 --> 15:45.041
God-Emperor Shabarra was murdered
by a demon that remains at large.

15:45.125 --> 15:51.416
The Princess of the Sun is dead.
There is no heir nor hope for one.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.166
We need a regent,

15:54.250 --> 15:59.375
a strong leader
to bring a new dawn to the empire.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.833
[Lina] And who would that be?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
[crowd gasping]

16:05.583 --> 16:08.708
Tihomir used her family wealth
to buy a title.

16:08.791 --> 16:11.791
Now she thinks she can use it
to buy an empire.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.416
Shabarra was weak.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.916
He could not protect the Imperium.
He could not even protect himself.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.458
Now we are asked to follow
another pretender?

16:19.541 --> 16:23.125
I can protect us. Name me Regent.

16:23.208 --> 16:27.625
You? With all your power,
you managed to destroy half the city

16:27.708 --> 16:31.833
and still failed to bring
the Emperor's assassin to justice.

16:31.916 --> 16:34.791
I tried to stop that thing. I failed.

16:34.875 --> 16:38.750
The Slayer sent it back to wherever
in the seven hells it came from.

16:38.833 --> 16:42.958
She saved countless lives.
I would be dead without her.

16:43.041 --> 16:46.416
You have no voice here, Dragon Knight.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.333
[Asar] Turn your eyes.

16:48.416 --> 16:54.333
Her Royal Highness, Mirana,
Daughter of Zal, Princess of the Sun.

16:54.416 --> 16:56.875
Gaze into her light.

16:56.958 --> 16:58.750
[crowd murmuring]

16:58.833 --> 17:02.958
[Mirana] Viceroy,
honored council members, senators.

17:03.041 --> 17:09.166
An assassin's arrow nearly took my life,
but I am not so easily dissuaded.

17:09.250 --> 17:12.958
As sole heir to this throne by blood,

17:13.041 --> 17:17.000
I intend to rule
as my father ruled before me.

17:17.083 --> 17:21.166
Years ago, I was forced
by treachery to flee my home.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.125
New treachery compels my return.

17:24.208 --> 17:28.125
The threat from the Coriel'Tauvi
looms as prophesied.

17:28.208 --> 17:31.833
The enclaves, silent for generations,
mass for war.

17:32.416 --> 17:36.625
We will join with our allies
and drive them back together.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.666
This is madness.
I don't know who is worse.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.666
Tihomir, who uses her wealth to buy power,

17:42.750 --> 17:46.041
or Mirana, who claims
it by accident of birth.

17:46.125 --> 17:50.416
You abandoned us,
renounced your claim to the throne,

17:50.500 --> 17:53.291
and we're just supposed
to accept this, and you?

17:53.375 --> 17:56.500
I have never forgotten my home or my duty.

17:56.583 --> 17:59.708
I risked my life time and again
for the Helio Imperium.

17:59.791 --> 18:02.958
[Lina] Princess Mirana wants to send
your sons and daughters

18:03.041 --> 18:06.166
to bleed and die
for the Nightsilver Woods.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.916
And for her goddess.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.791
If Mene returns,
it means the end of everything.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.416
How convenient for your ambitions.

18:13.500 --> 18:18.000
Honor the Princess out of respect
for her father, salute Tihomir's service,

18:18.083 --> 18:22.666
but for the empire's sake,
offer the crown to one of your own.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.708
[Tihomir] Enough. I call for a vote.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.291
The Princess is not ready to rule,

18:28.375 --> 18:31.750
but I can serve the empire best
as I serve it now.

18:32.458 --> 18:37.458
I withdraw my name
and rise in support of the Slayer.

18:40.041 --> 18:44.333
Legatus Tihomir calls the vote.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.458
[priest] This circle we now lay
upon your head

18:47.541 --> 18:50.041
represents not the scope of your power

18:50.125 --> 18:54.666
but the weight of your burden,
our regent, our voice,

18:54.750 --> 18:57.250
servant, and protector.

18:57.333 --> 19:01.750
I am your voice, your servant,
your protector.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.041
[snarling]

19:05.125 --> 19:07.041
[creatures squealing]

19:09.958 --> 19:11.125
[soldier] Ready shields!

19:12.750 --> 19:14.125
Ready weapons!

19:15.166 --> 19:17.458
-[woman 3] Up there!
-[man 6] In the sky!

19:17.541 --> 19:18.416
[soldier] What in the hell--

19:22.083 --> 19:23.250
[soldiers grunting]

19:25.833 --> 19:27.000
[growls]

19:34.125 --> 19:37.125
[Emperor Shabarra]
The Solar Throne commends your bravery.

19:37.208 --> 19:41.333
My generals report you single-handedly
drove off the arachnid army.

19:41.416 --> 19:44.125
The Seventh Legion
was fortunate you intervened.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.416
Yes, Majesty.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.208
But why did they need me
when they have you?

19:48.958 --> 19:50.125
I beg your pardon?

19:50.208 --> 19:54.125
You're God-Emperor.
Why did they need me when they have you?

19:55.000 --> 20:00.125
They do have me. Everyone has me.
Now, how shall I reward you?

20:00.208 --> 20:04.000
Your own legion, a seat in the senate,
or perhaps a name?

20:04.083 --> 20:06.083
Your legion gave me a name.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.875
[crowd] Slayer!

20:09.958 --> 20:12.750
Slayer! Slayer!

20:12.833 --> 20:17.625
Slayer! Slayer! Slayer!

20:18.291 --> 20:22.833
We should discuss the composition
of the Imperial War Council

20:22.916 --> 20:25.750
at your convenience, of course.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.500
Yes. Yes, of course. Excuse me.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.666
[approaching footsteps]

20:36.208 --> 20:38.791
I used to sit in my father's lap
in this chair.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.916
It was a horrible breach of protocol.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.833
I didn't understand.
I'm not sure he cared.

20:44.916 --> 20:48.125
I'm sure he didn't.
Your father was a decent man.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.791
Too decent for this place.

20:49.875 --> 20:54.250
I'm sure of that as well.
I'm more sure of that than anything.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.083
I can't stay here.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.833
There are things
I have left undone for too long.

20:58.916 --> 21:02.666
-Then perhaps this was for the best.
-If it helps you to think so.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.000
None of this was personal.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.500
Everything is personal.
That's what makes us human.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.666
You're not what
I imagined you to be, or who.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.958
I thought you were like him,
like Shabarra.

21:14.041 --> 21:16.583
I thought the two of you
would make things so much worse.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.250
Well, things are worse,
so I suppose we did.

21:20.375 --> 21:23.541
Just not as your imagination
suggested we might.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.208
-I was mistaken.
-Not irreparably.

21:26.291 --> 21:29.541
So, you know,
if the Coriel'Tauvi dare attack us,

21:29.625 --> 21:32.333
I will travel
to the Nightsilver Woods myself.

21:32.416 --> 21:36.458
I will make deserts of their enclaves
and I will call it peace.

21:38.125 --> 21:39.458
Your Highness.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.041
[Davion] Princess.

21:47.125 --> 21:50.875
Gods, it's good to see you,
to know you're safe.

21:50.958 --> 21:53.125
Asar, give us a moment.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.208
[Davion] If I'd known you were, you know,

21:56.291 --> 21:57.958
that you'd gotten better,
I would have come.

21:58.041 --> 21:59.000
You couldn't know.

21:59.083 --> 22:02.125
-You should have told me.
-We told no one.

22:02.208 --> 22:04.791
Look, none of this is what I wanted.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.833
[Mirana] What was it
you wanted, precisely?

22:07.333 --> 22:08.583
Slyrak sent me.

22:09.208 --> 22:12.833
I had no idea you'd be here.
I… I didn't even hope.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.250
Slyrak sent you to kill the Emperor
and lie to the Senate.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.500
He sent you to turn
this place upside down.

22:17.583 --> 22:20.833
He sent me to find the one thing
that might stop Terrorblade.

22:20.916 --> 22:24.666
Lina can help me get it.
The rest happened.

22:24.750 --> 22:28.875
-[Mirana] So, you're with her?
-For now. Until this is over.

22:28.958 --> 22:32.458
-[Mirana] Until you have what you want.
-You know what I want.

22:32.541 --> 22:36.458
[Mirana] The last time I saw you
in the enclave, fighting for our lives,

22:36.541 --> 22:39.625
I remember what you risked for my sake.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.208
I prayed to the Goddess
you were still in there.

22:42.291 --> 22:43.125
[exhales deeply]

22:43.208 --> 22:48.333
I prayed my Davion would not be lost
to the monster he carried inside of him.

22:48.416 --> 22:54.541
Now here you are, a familiar face,
but I wonder if I know the man.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.625
I am the man you remember.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.708
[Mirana] The man I remember
promised me he would see it through.

22:59.791 --> 23:02.333
He promised we would find a way together.

23:02.416 --> 23:04.666
-Asar.
-Mirana.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.750
[Mirana] I'm glad you're safe.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.791
[somber music playing]

23:14.791 --> 23:15.875
[knocking on door]

23:17.625 --> 23:20.125
I'm sorry to disturb you
at this hour, Princess.

23:20.708 --> 23:22.666
[Asar] You have a visitor.

23:23.250 --> 23:24.916
[soft growl]

23:25.833 --> 23:28.166
[tranquil music playing]

23:31.583 --> 23:33.083
[soft growl]

23:35.458 --> 23:37.750
[Luna] I have news you'll want to hear
and news you won't.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.083
We tracked down your assassin.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.458
And what is it I don't want to hear?

23:42.541 --> 23:46.708
She's still alive,
and we know who hired her.

23:46.791 --> 23:49.500
They just put a crown on her head.

23:51.166 --> 23:53.166
[closing theme music playing]
