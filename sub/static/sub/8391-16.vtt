NOT LET ME MAKE ANY DECISIONS.

00:06.860 --> 00:09.135
OKAY?
I'M STARTING TO REALIZE

00:09.180 --> 00:10.829
THAT YOU ARE VERY CONTROLLING.

00:10.870 --> 00:11.825

IN A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS

00:13.560 --> 00:15.073
A HUNDRED DIFFERENT TIMES.

I'M SORRY.
I WANT TO BE PART

00:25.850 --> 00:28.125
I TALKED TO HIM.
HE'S DIFFERENT.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.640

00:30.680 --> 00:31.749
I NEED TO BUY THE INGREDIENTS

00:31.790 --> 00:34.406
I NEED TO BUY BUG-THEMED STUFF

WHICH IS AWESOME.

00:40.140 --> 00:40.925
- WHY CAN'T WE JUST BUY

00:40.970 --> 00:42.653
BUG-SHAPED COOKIES
FROM SOMEWHERE?

00:42.690 --> 00:44.794

00:46.350 --> 00:49.103
IT'S HERE,

IT REALLY IS.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.432

02:31.970 --> 02:33.483
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF
YOU SAID?

02:33.530 --> 02:34.974

02:35.010 --> 02:36.875
WHEN THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIGHT, OKAY?

02:36.910 --> 02:37.729
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE

02:37.770 --> 02:39.453
AN ACTUAL ISSUE
WE NEED TO WORK OUT.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.877
- YOU SAID THAT YOU COULDN'T
MARRY A WOMAN LIKE ME.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.729
- YEAH, IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN ARGUMENT.

02:43.780 --> 02:46.431

THAT I WAS CONTROLLING,

02:46.470 --> 02:47.744
YOU WERE DISAPPEARING,

02:47.780 --> 02:49.407
AND YOU DON'T LIKE
MY VISION FOR OUR FAMILY.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.953
- YOU'RE TWISTING MY WORDS
RIGHT NOW.

02:50.990 --> 02:52.924
THAT IS NOT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.928
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID IT.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.269
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

02:57.310 --> 02:58.823
IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT EVERYTHING I SAID

02:58.860 --> 03:01.203
WAS GONNA BE USED AGAINST ME,
I WOULD HAVE HAD A LAWYER THERE.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.480
- WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU CALL
YOUR SISTER THEN?

03:03.520 --> 03:07.240
I WON'T CRY, CRY, CRY

03:07.290 --> 03:09.929
FOR YOU, BABY

03:09.980 --> 03:13.768
- THERE WILL BE NO DEVIATING
FROM SCHEDULED SHOW TIME.

03:13.810 --> 03:15.846

03:27.410 --> 03:30.994
MINIMUM OF TWO AVAILABLE OUTLETS
IS MANDATORY.

03:31.030 --> 03:33.237
- I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE TWO OUTLETS

03:33.280 --> 03:35.828
THAT ARE 15 FEET AWAY--
- THAT'S A DEAL BREAKER.

03:35.870 --> 03:36.791
- NO, YES, WE DO.
YES, WE DO.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.821
WE HAVE THAT ONE
BY THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW

03:38.870 --> 03:40.838
AND THEN THE ONE BY THE HOSE.
THAT'S LESS THAN 15 FEET.

03:40.870 --> 03:43.555
- REALLY BAD IDEA TO HAVE
AN OUTLET BY A HOSE.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.761
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
- IT CAME LIKE THAT.

03:45.810 --> 03:46.970

KIND OF A BIG FAMILY,
AND THEN HIS WHOLE CLASS

03:53.990 --> 03:56.538
IS GONNA BE COMING, SO CAN YOU
STRETCH THAT TO 35 OR SO?

03:56.580 --> 03:57.808

03:57.850 --> 03:58.885
- NO, NO.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.992
- STOP MAKING HIM MAD, DAD.
- OKAY, 25 IT IS.

04:02.030 --> 04:04.544
FINALLY, NO CLAPPING
WILL BE TOLERATED.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.992
ALL RIGHT.
- THERE'S GONNA BE KIDS HERE.

04:07.030 --> 04:08.270
THERE'S GONNA BE CLAPPING.

04:08.310 --> 04:09.754
- VERY BAD FOR THE BUGS.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.416
- YEAH, IT REALLY IS TERRIBLE.
IT SCRAMBLES THEIR BRAINS.

04:12.450 --> 04:13.792
- NO CLAPPING. WE'LL MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO CLAPPING.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.036
I THINK WE GOT IT
ALL COVERED.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.934
- I'M GONNA USE YOUR BATHROOM.

04:16.980 --> 04:18.971
- YEAH, IT'S UPSTAIRS.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.739

OH, MY--I'M GONNA GO GET
MY BEETLE SCRAPBOOK

04:27.050 --> 04:31.919
AND SHOW IT TO HIM.

04:31.960 --> 04:32.949
- HE'S THE WEIRDEST PERSON

04:32.990 --> 04:33.957
I'VE EVER MET
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

04:33.990 --> 04:34.911
- THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

04:34.960 --> 04:35.984
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- THERE'S GONNA BE

04:36.030 --> 04:37.019

I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.369
- OH, HELL, YEAH.
I CAN'T IMAGINE 25 PEOPLE.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.025
IT'S OUR HOUSE.
HE CAN'T TELL US HOW MANY--

04:41.070 --> 04:42.446
- THIS GUY PERFORMED
AT MAX'S SCHOOL?

04:42.480 --> 04:43.447
ARE YOU SURE WE GOT
THE RIGHT GUY?

04:43.490 --> 04:47.824

[shower running]

04:47.870 --> 04:49.792
HONEY, I DON'T KNOW

06:13.090 --> 06:15.433
AND YOU'RE GONNA BLOW
THE INGREDIENTS.

06:15.470 --> 06:17.882

OFF, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.194

06:38.150 --> 06:39.879
SAY IT AGAIN.

YOU CAN'T DISCHARGE.
YOU CAN'T DISCHARGE

06:49.650 --> 06:50.878
48 HOURS BEFORE I'M OVULATING.

THINK OF OUR BABY

06:55.000 --> 06:56.160
WAITING TO BE CONCEIVED.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.543
- THAT'S A LITTLE MEAN.

06:58.590 --> 06:59.989
- IT'S NOT MEAN.
- THAT'S KIND OF CRUEL.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.655
- NO, IT'S NATURE.

07:01.690 --> 07:02.998
I DIDN'T MAKE THE RULES.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.486
TWO MORE DAYS.
OKAY?

07:05.520 --> 07:06.839
- OKAY.

I LOVE YOU.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.979

HE'S GREAT.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.608
HUH.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.504
YEAH.

07:28.100 --> 07:31.649

WHAT?

07:31.690 --> 07:35.854
I--I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.754

HIS BUSINESS.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.939
- RIGHT.
- AND HE'S QUITE GOOD.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.892
- YEAH.

07:41.940 --> 07:44.738
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
AT A PARTY AT YOUR HOUSE.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.590
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S GONNA WORK.

07:46.630 --> 07:49.838
I MEAN, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ALL THESE KIDS THERE THAT--

07:49.880 --> 07:51.529
- JUST DO
WHAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.017

ON THE LAST ONE.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.197
- THANK YOU.

07:57.230 --> 07:58.674
- MY SIX STICKERS?

07:58.710 --> 08:00.746
- NO, I HAVE
YOUR TWO STICKERS, MAX.

08:00.790 --> 08:03.509
- NO, I'M SUPPOSED TO GET
SIX STICKERS

08:03.550 --> 08:04.812
FOR FINISHING MY HOMEWORK.
- NO, WE CHANGED THE RULE.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.543
REMEMBER?
NOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING OLDER

08:06.580 --> 08:08.093
AND SO GROWN UP, WE'RE WEANING
YOU OFF THE STICKERS.

08:08.140 --> 08:10.517
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK.

08:10.550 --> 08:11.824
- MAX.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.588
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

08:13.630 --> 08:14.892
- I DON'T WANT TO.

08:14.940 --> 08:17.556
- MAX. GETTING UPSET'S
NOT GONNA CHANGE IT.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.828
YOU GET TWO STICKERS.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.974
- I DON'T LIKE
THIS NEW RULE,

08:21.010 --> 08:22.898
AND I DON'T LIKE YOU.

08:22.950 --> 08:23.905
IT'S JUST--
- MAX.

08:23.950 --> 08:25.042
- I JUST DON'T--
- MAX.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.978
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.806
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO COME HERE TODAY?

08:28.850 --> 08:30.056
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO CHANGE THE RULE?

08:30.090 --> 08:32.058
YOU JUST RUIN EVERYTHING.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.024
YOU'RE ACT UALLY--
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

08:34.060 --> 08:34.913
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.848
YOU JUST THINK
THAT YOU'RE HELPING ME,

08:36.890 --> 08:38.858
BUT IT'S JUST--
IT'S A JOKE.

08:38.890 --> 08:42.166
IT'S--I HAVEN'T LEARNED
ONE SINGLE THING FROM YOU.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.235
- MAX.
- SINCE YOU STARTED COMING HERE.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.588
- MAX. STOP IT.

08:45.620 --> 08:46.826
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- MAX.

08:46.870 --> 08:48.656
- HEY, HEY.
- YOU'RE USELESS!

08:48.700 --> 08:50.031
- THAT IS ENOUGH.
MAX.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.593
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE HERE.
- MAX.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.621
- MAX. HEY, HEY.
- [screaming indistinctly]

08:53.670 --> 08:56.184
- HOLY CRAP.

09:00.950 --> 09:02.042
ARE YOU OKAY?

09:02.090 --> 09:04.877
- I'M USED TO IT.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.127
- YOU CAN'T BE USED TO THAT.

09:07.160 --> 09:11.574
- UM...

09:11.620 --> 09:12.928
WHAT DO YOU--
LAUNDRY?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.269
- YEAH, I'M DOING LAUNDRY.

09:15.310 --> 09:17.096
YOU'RE NOT OKAY.
- I'M FINE. HONESTLY.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.653
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M DOING THIS.

09:18.690 --> 09:19.850
- YOU WANT ME
TO CALL ADAM?

09:19.900 --> 09:21.106
- NO, NO, NO, PLEASE,
PLEASE.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.938
I JUST NEED--
I NEED TO GO BACK UPSTAIRS.

09:23.970 --> 09:26.598
- WELL, I'LL BE HERE
DOING LAUNDRY FOR TWO HOURS

09:26.630 --> 09:27.665
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.691
- THANK YOU.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.886
- KRISTINA, HOW DID WE NOT SEE
THAT THIS GUY HAS ASPERGER'S?

09:40.920 --> 09:41.955
- HONEY, I DON'T KNOW.

09:41.990 --> 09:44.675
I FELT LIKE A TOTAL MORON
WHEN SHE SAID THAT.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.369
- I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
WE'RE JUST SO USED TO THINKING

09:46.410 --> 09:47.741
ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF KIDS.

09:47.790 --> 09:48.950
- UH-HUH.
- WE FORGET THEY GROW UP.

09:49.000 --> 09:49.955
- I KNOW.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.230
- OH, MY GOD.
- BUT THEY DO.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.965
THEY DO GROW UP.

09:55.000 --> 09:55.932
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.109
DO YOU THINK
THAT WE SHOULD USE THIS GUY

09:58.140 --> 09:59.072
FOR THE BIRTHDAY PARTY
OR NOT?

09:59.110 --> 10:00.145
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE ETHICALLY...

10:00.180 --> 10:01.317
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.794
I MEAN, IT MAKES ME
REALLY NERVOUS.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.216
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HOUSE

10:04.250 --> 10:05.899
FULL OF AUTISTIC KIDS.

10:05.950 --> 10:06.905
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

10:06.950 --> 10:09.259
NOT ACCORDING TO PLAN?
HE'S GONNA LOSE IT.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.939
- LOOK, HONEY, I'M THINKING
THE SAME THING.

10:10.980 --> 10:11.799
I'M THINKING THE SAME THING.
IT SUCKS.

10:11.850 --> 10:15.843
- RIGHT.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:15.890 --> 10:17.949
I MEAN, I FEEL
LIKE A HYPOCRITE

10:17.990 --> 10:19.742
BECAUSE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
WHAT IF ONE DAY

10:19.790 --> 10:22.190
MAX WANTS TO GET A JOB
AND THE PEOPLE DON'T HIRE HIM

10:22.240 --> 10:23.855
BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.232
- ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE

10:25.270 --> 10:27.340
TO BE ETHICAL SUPERHEROES
ABOUT THIS.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.961
- NO, WE DON'T.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.444
I DON'T--
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE DO.

10:30.490 --> 10:33.243
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
WE ACTUALLY OWE IT TO MAX

10:33.280 --> 10:35.009
TO TRUST OUR GUTS
ON THIS ONE.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.280
AND AS MUCH AS I WANT
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

10:36.320 --> 10:38.663
HIRING A MAN
WITH ASPERGER'S

10:38.700 --> 10:39.906
TO ENTERTAIN
AT MY SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,

10:39.940 --> 10:41.214
I REALLY DON'T.
- OKAY.

10:41.260 --> 10:45.424
THEN THE algSWER'S NO.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.257
- I COULD NOT DO YOUR JOB.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.813
THAT SOUNDS VERY STRESSFUL.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.330
- I DON'T KNOW.
JUST, I GUESS, BETWEEN THE KIDS

10:52.370 --> 10:54.850
AND THEIR NEEDS
AND THEIR PARENTS SOMETIMES

10:54.890 --> 10:57.779
CAN BE A LOT,
AND THE CRITICISM--

10:57.820 --> 11:00.994
IT JUST--IT CAN SOMETIMES FEEL
A LITTLE THANKLESS.

11:01.030 --> 11:04.170
THAT'S ALL.

11:04.210 --> 11:05.893
BUT...I DON'T KNOW.

11:05.940 --> 11:08.829
- IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE
VERY ISOLATING TOO.

11:08.870 --> 11:10.861
LIKE, KIND OF LONELY.

11:14.770 --> 11:16.249
- ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE NOW?

11:16.290 --> 11:17.871
- YOU'RE NOT LONELY.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.286
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.184
- [laughs]

11:21.230 --> 11:22.299
LET'S NOT GO THERE.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.958
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE LONELY?

11:24.990 --> 11:26.878
'CAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
- [laughs]

11:26.920 --> 11:28.160
- YOU ONLY INTERACT
WITH BLIND PEOPLE?

11:28.200 --> 11:29.167
- COME ON.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.849
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.131
WHY ARE YOU
IN THE DOGHOUSE?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.899
- UM...

11:34.930 --> 11:38.343
APPARENTLY I SHOULDN'T BE
MAKING ANY DECISIONS,

11:38.380 --> 11:41.008
IS WHAT I'M GATHERING.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.760
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

11:44.800 --> 11:48.930
- WELL, UM,
I DON'T KNOW.

11:48.980 --> 11:50.902
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T BE
MAKING DECISIONS.

11:50.950 --> 11:52.906
- WHY NOT?

11:52.950 --> 11:54.281
- I DON'T KNOW.
DO I STRIKE YOU

11:54.330 --> 11:56.742
AS SOMEONE THAT SHOULD BE MAKING
A LOT OF DECISIONS?

11:56.780 --> 11:59.157
- I MEAN,
YOU'RE A SMART GUY.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.407
- YOU THINK SO?

12:01.440 --> 12:03.169
- YEAH.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.543
- YOU HAVE
A VERY KIND OPINION OF ME.

12:05.580 --> 12:09.209
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.131
- I'M JUST BEING HONEST.

12:15.940 --> 12:17.931
[snorts]
SORRY.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.449
OW.
- CAREFUL.

12:19.490 --> 12:20.969
DON'T KNOCK YOUR TEETH OUT.

12:24.980 --> 12:26.254
- I SHOULD PROBABLY--
- YOU GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE?

12:26.290 --> 12:30.909
- YEAH.

12:30.950 --> 12:35.887
UM...

12:35.920 --> 12:37.956
THANK YOU.

12:37.990 --> 12:42.199
- THANK YOU.
- UM...

12:42.240 --> 12:43.548
DO I...

13:07.160 --> 13:08.081
- OKAY, AND ONCE THE DOUGH
HAS CHILLED FOR 20 MINUTES,

13:08.130 --> 13:10.291
THEN WE NEED TO PUT IT
ON A BOARD AND...

13:10.340 --> 13:12.547
OKAY, WORK IT
INTO SHAPE.

13:12.580 --> 13:15.333
- IT'S IN SHAPE.
IT'S IN...

13:17.450 --> 13:18.587
GREAT SHAPE.

13:18.620 --> 13:19.587
- GOOD, SO THEN WE NEED

13:19.620 --> 13:20.962
TO WORK THE DOUGH

13:21.000 --> 13:23.104
UNTIL IT COMES TOGETHER.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:23.140 --> 13:26.416
- IT MEANS THE DOUGH FORMS
INTO A COHESIVE UNIT.

13:26.460 --> 13:31.215
AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
COME TOGETHER

13:31.250 --> 13:34.879
TO DO WHAT NATURE INTENDED
FLOUR AND BUTTER

13:34.910 --> 13:38.038
AND BAKING SODA TO DO.

13:38.090 --> 13:41.014
- HEY.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.199
ARE YOU OKAY
OVER THERE?

13:43.230 --> 13:45.152
- AM I OKAY?
NO.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.057
NO, JULIA,
I'M MAKING LOVE TO DOUGH.

13:49.100 --> 13:53.093
- FROM A BIRD'S EYE VIEW,
YOU CAN SEE IT

13:53.140 --> 13:56.610
IT'S SUBLIME
AND IT'S ABSURD

13:56.660 --> 13:58.309
- I LOVE YOU.

13:58.350 --> 14:02.309
- MM. YOU PICK
THE STRANGEST TIMES TO SAY THAT.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.972
- IT'S WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

14:07.010 --> 14:08.079
- YEAH.
DO YOU HAVE TO LEAN OVER?

14:08.120 --> 14:09.451
- OKAY.
WOW.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.287
ALL RIGHT.
THE CLOCK IS TICKING, OKAY?

14:12.330 --> 14:14.423
- MM-HMM.
- HEY.

14:14.470 --> 14:17.268
I WILL MAKE IT
SO WORTH YOUR WAIT.

14:17.300 --> 14:22.192
- LOVE IS A DIRTY WORD

14:22.240 --> 14:23.264
- THAT'S NOT NICE.

14:23.310 --> 14:25.642
WHAT YOU JUST DID.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.169
- LOVE IS A DIRTY WORD

14:27.210 --> 14:29.132
- [indistinct muttering]

14:29.170 --> 14:32.298
[door shuts]
- HI.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.386
DID WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

14:34.420 --> 14:37.241
- THIS IS SOMETHING I GIVE
TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HIRE ME.

14:37.290 --> 14:39.281
IT'S A SMILING PLUSH CRICKET.

14:40.530 --> 14:42.259
CRICKETS CAN'T ACTUALLY SMILE,
THOUGH.

14:44.090 --> 14:47.253
BUT A THOUGHTFUL GIFT
HELPS CREATE REPEAT BUSINESS.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.915
- THAT'S TRUE,
AND IT'S REALLY CUTE AND NICE

14:48.950 --> 14:51.123
AND SMILING
IN ITS ANTHRO--

14:51.160 --> 14:52.195
HEY, HONEY.
- HEY.

14:52.230 --> 14:53.219
ANDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:53.270 --> 14:55.090
- I'M HERE TO MEASURE
FOR THE SHOW SATURDAY.

14:55.130 --> 14:56.336
I ALWAYS MEASURE
TWO DAYS AHEAD.

14:56.370 --> 14:59.373
- UH...

14:59.410 --> 15:01.446
- I DIDN'T CALL HIM.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.163
- HONEY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

15:03.210 --> 15:04.438
- HE BROUGHT US
A PLUSH CRICKET.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.276
- HONEY,
HE'S GOING IN THE HOUSE.

15:05.310 --> 15:07.369
- OKAY, WELL,
THEN DO SOMETHING.

15:07.420 --> 15:10.412
- HEY.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.971
- WHAT IS HE DOING?
- HE DOESN'T LOOK VERY HAPPY.

15:16.010 --> 15:17.329
- WHAT IS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.282
HE DOESN'T LOOK HAPPY.
- I HAVE NO IDEA, MAX.

15:19.330 --> 15:20.217
- DOES THIS MEAN
HE'S NOT GONNA DO MY PARTY?

15:20.260 --> 15:22.080
- OH, NO.
- WE DON'T KNOW.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.394
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING.

15:23.430 --> 15:24.431
- MAX.
- ARE YOU GONNA DO MY PARTY?

15:24.470 --> 15:25.505
- NO.
- WHY?

15:25.540 --> 15:26.746
- YOUR YARD
HAS NO SUN PROTECTION.

15:26.780 --> 15:28.190
MY BUGS WILL FRY OUT HERE.

15:28.230 --> 15:30.334
- WE CAN DO IT INSIDE.
CAN WE DO IT INSIDE?

15:30.370 --> 15:32.190
WE HAVE TO.
- IT'S OKAY.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.753
- WE CAN DO IT INSIDE.
- MAX, CALM DOWN.

15:33.790 --> 15:35.405
- ANDY, AN DY,
IS IT POSSIBLE

15:35.450 --> 15:37.998
TO DO THE SHOW INSIDE?

15:38.040 --> 15:39.758
- LET ME TAKE SOMESIIVIEASUREMENTS.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.586
HE'S TAKING MEASUREMENTS.
- WHOO-HOO!

15:41.630 --> 15:44.201
- ADAM, WAY TOO LOUD.
I'M TRYING TO WORK HERE.

15:47.320 --> 15:48.764
- CAN'T FIRE HIM NOW.
- I'M NOT.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.449
YOU WANTED TO.
- YOU WANT ME TO GRAB THIS KIT?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.707
- NO, ONLY I TOUCH IT.

15:56.740 --> 15:58.981
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.717
[door shuts]

16:12.620 --> 16:14.303
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:16.630 --> 16:19.519
- THIS FIGHT
IS SO POINTLESS.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.358
I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT BLEW UP TO THIS POINT,

16:22.390 --> 16:25.188
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

16:25.220 --> 16:28.462
I MEAN...

16:28.500 --> 16:31.298
DID YOU JUST WAKE UP AND DECIDE
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE ME ANYMORE?

16:31.330 --> 16:35.778
OR THAT I'M NOT WORTH
WORKING THIS OUT?

16:35.820 --> 16:40.336
I DON'T LIKE IT.

16:40.370 --> 16:44.238
- YEAH, WELL, I DON'T LIKE
HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO JABBAR

16:44.270 --> 16:45.714
WHY HIS FATHER'S NOT HOME.

16:45.760 --> 16:50.345
CROSBY, WE HAVE ISSUES,

16:50.380 --> 16:55.488
AND WE'RE TRYING
TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES

16:55.530 --> 16:58.454
BECAUSE WE WANT
TO BE TOGETHER.

16:58.500 --> 17:02.322
BUT JUST BECAUSE WE WANT IT

17:02.360 --> 17:05.420
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

17:05.470 --> 17:08.530
I THINK WE NEED SOME TIME...

17:08.570 --> 17:13.052
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE REALLY WANT.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.819
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

17:15.860 --> 17:17.339
THAT I'M MAKING
THE RIGHT DECISION

17:17.380 --> 17:19.336
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

17:19.380 --> 17:22.588
YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.557
- WELL, THAT SCARES ME.

17:33.600 --> 17:37.388
- ME TOO.

17:43.470 --> 17:46.815
[door closes,
approaching footsteps]

17:46.850 --> 17:49.159
- ZEEK.

IT'S A GOOD THING.

WAITING OUT HERE?

18:24.960 --> 18:26.302

[laughs]

18:26.340 --> 18:29.161
NO, YOU KNOW,
WANTING TO SEE YOUR SON.

18:29.210 --> 18:31.826
WANTING TO SEE DREW.
I MEAN, HE MISSED YOU.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.169

18:35.210 --> 18:36.177
AND I DON'T LIKE YOU.

TO BE HOSPITABLE, SETH.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.851
YOU KNOW?

19:03.900 --> 19:05.652
AND THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT
OF FORGIVENESS IN ALL THAT.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.339
- GOD, YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.316

WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.893

19:41.930 --> 19:43.727
- HEY.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.457
YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT MY DAUGHTER
EVER IN FRONT OF ME,

19:47.490 --> 19:50.550
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

19:50.600 --> 19:54.422
AND I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU WANT TO SEE DREW.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.599
BUT YOU HARM THAT BOY,

19:56.640 --> 20:01.009

20:21.730 --> 20:23.209
[engine starts]

20:42.580 --> 20:43.956
- THANK YOU.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.446

20:46.480 --> 20:47.924
BUT THEY'RE STILL IN THERE.

20:47.970 --> 20:52.930

21:04.090 --> 21:05.842
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT
LIKE YOUR MOTHER,

21:05.880 --> 21:07.802
AND YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.638
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

21:11.680 --> 21:16.572
- I'M SORRY THAT I'M NOT
EVERYTHING I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

21:16.620 --> 21:19.373
WE ARE WHO WE ARE.

21:19.410 --> 21:23.722
IT'S HARD HAVING PEOPLE TELL YOU
THAT YOU DON'T ADD UP

21:23.760 --> 21:26.445
EVEN IF YOU DON'T ADD UP.

21:26.490 --> 21:29.550

THERE HAS TO BE

22:27.200 --> 22:28.929

BUT, DREW,
IF THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN,

26:08.980 --> 26:11.005
I WILL NOT HESITATE
TO SUSPEND YOU.

26:11.050 --> 26:14.144
- WE UNDERSTAND.
WE TOTALLY--

26:14.190 --> 26:16.010
WE ALL UNDERSTAND.

26:16.050 --> 26:19.156
THANK YOU.

26:19.190 --> 26:20.669
LET ME SEE.

26:20.710 --> 26:22.120
- ELBOWS IN,
HANDS UP HIGH.

26:22.160 --> 26:22.956
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

26:22.990 --> 26:24.127
- IS IT SWOLLEN?
- I TOLD YOU, KID,

26:24.160 --> 26:25.980
YOU GET IN THE FIRST LICK,

26:26.030 --> 26:27.292
YOU'LL SHUT HIM UP.
- THE FIRST?

26:27.340 --> 26:31.265
NO, NO, HONEY, THE MESSAGE
IS THAT WE DON'T FIGHT.

26:31.310 --> 26:32.652
- OH, GOD, HERE IT COMES.
- THAT DON'T FIGHT.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.032
- HE ALMOST JUST GOT KICKED
OUT OF SCHOOL.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.924
- HE KICKED A BULLY'S ASS.
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.062
- I DID NOT ALMOST GET KICKED
OUT OF SCHOOL.

26:37.110 --> 26:39.078
JUST STOP. YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING
TO BLAME IT ON HIM.

26:39.110 --> 26:40.839
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT, OKAY?

26:40.870 --> 26:41.905
I'M THE ONE
WHO PUNCHED THE GUY.

26:41.940 --> 26:44.420
REALLY, MOM,
I'M GOING HOME WITH DAD.

26:44.460 --> 26:47.736
I'LL JUST SEE YOU AT THE HOUSE.

26:47.770 --> 26:49.738
- GET IN THERE, KID.
- TOO MUCH.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.600
- WEAR A SEATBELT!

26:53.920 --> 26:56.912
[cell phone buzzing]

26:59.960 --> 27:01.746
- HEY.
- HEY.

27:01.790 --> 27:04.122
- I'M SO GLAD YOU CALLED.

27:04.170 --> 27:07.333
- LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY,

27:07.380 --> 27:10.793
BUT I GOT TO TAKE JABBAR
TO THE DESERT FOR A FEW DAYS

27:10.830 --> 27:13.799
TO VISIT MY AUNT.

27:13.830 --> 27:16.970
- WELL, IT'S MAX'S BIRTHDAY
TOMORROW.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.046
- I KNOW.
I'M REALLY SORRY,

27:19.080 --> 27:22.868
BUT MY AUNT
HASN'T BEEN FEELING WELL,

27:22.910 --> 27:24.901
AND MY MOM IS GOING OUT
TO HELP HER,

27:24.950 --> 27:29.432
AND I'D LIKE TO GO WITH HER
AND BRING JABBAR.

27:29.470 --> 27:31.290
HE HASN'T SEEN HIS AUNT
IN A LONG TIME.

27:34.340 --> 27:36.854
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S FAIR.

27:36.890 --> 27:37.811
- I KNOW.

27:37.860 --> 27:40.784
I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS
ABOUT THE BRAVERMANS,

27:40.830 --> 27:43.037
BUT JABBAR'S AUNT
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE HIM,

27:43.070 --> 27:45.959
AND I'M TAKING HIM,
SO...

27:46.000 --> 27:50.835
- JASMINE, WHAT IS GOING ON?

27:50.870 --> 27:52.974
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:53.010 --> 27:57.049
- WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER
AND TALK THIS OUT.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.423
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO.

27:59.470 --> 28:04.328
- I'M NOT READY FOR THAT
RIGHT NOW, CROSBY.

28:04.370 --> 28:07.840
GOOD-BYE.

28:16.100 --> 28:19.968
[overlapping shouting]

28:20.000 --> 28:21.274
- KIDS, SETTLE DOWN
OVER THERE.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.446
- I CAN DO THIS.

28:22.490 --> 28:24.526
- OKAY, NO RUNNING.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.970
- OH, NO.
COME ON NOW.

28:26.010 --> 28:27.318
DON'T RUN THROUGH HERE.
YOU GUYS.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.839
NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.906
YOU GUYS,
THE PIATA'S FOR LATER.

28:30.950 --> 28:32.178
LATER.
KYLE.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.848
WE'RE GONNA WAIT ON THIS,
OKAY?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.359
H EY.
HEY, ADAM!

28:36.400 --> 28:38.812
ADAM!
- NO.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.192
YOU CHEATED.

28:40.230 --> 28:42.050
- YOU WORRIED ABOUT JABBAR?

28:42.090 --> 28:44.888
- HE'S NOT ACTUALLY SICK.

28:44.930 --> 28:46.784
JASMINE DIDN'T WANT TO COME,

28:46.820 --> 28:51.541
SO SHE JUST TOOK HIM
TO HER AUNT'S FOR THE WEEKEND.

28:51.590 --> 28:54.718
- I'M SORRY.

28:59.250 --> 29:02.105
- YEAH, IT'S JUST HE'S ALWAYS
HAD SENSITIVITY TO NOISE,

29:02.150 --> 29:05.142
SO IF THERE'S ANY WAY
WE COULD ASK THE KIDS

29:05.190 --> 29:06.908
TO NOT CLAP
AFTER THE BIRTHDAY CANDLES.

29:06.950 --> 29:08.463
- OKAY.
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT,

29:08.500 --> 29:11.048
BECAUSE IT'S ANY SUDDEN LOUD
NOISE, AND HE JUST GOES BERSERK.

29:11.090 --> 29:13.081
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ARE THESE GLUTEN-FREE THEN?

29:13.130 --> 29:14.813
- THE CUPCAKES?

29:14.850 --> 29:15.919
- CAN I TAKE
ONE OF THE BUGS OFF?

29:15.960 --> 29:17.291
HE DOESN'T LIKE BUGS.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.570
- ARE YOU MAX'S MOM?
- I AM.

29:19.610 --> 29:21.305
- I NEED MY PIZZA
WITH JUST CHEESE.

29:21.340 --> 29:22.784
- I'M HIS BROTHER.

29:22.830 --> 29:25.207
HE LIKES HIS PIZZA
WITH JUST CHEESE AND NO SAUCE.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.231
- JUST CHEESE?
- JUST CHEESE.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.542
NO SAUCE, NO TOPPINGS,
NO SPICES,

29:28.590 --> 29:30.558
NO PEPPERONI,
JUST CHEESE.

29:30.590 --> 29:31.966
PINEAPPLES ARE OKAY.

29:32.010 --> 29:33.238
- JUST CHEESE PIZZA.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.214
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

29:35.250 --> 29:36.319
- JUST CHEESE.
- HEY, HENRY, YOU KNOW

29:36.360 --> 29:37.315
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?
WE'RE GONNA MAKE

29:37.360 --> 29:38.520
A VERY SPECIAL PIZZA ORDER

29:38.560 --> 29:40.141
JUST FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

29:40.190 --> 29:41.805
ALL RIGHT,
WITH JUST CHEESE.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.229
[doorbell rings]
UH...

29:44.260 --> 29:45.534
THERE'S ANDY.
- OKAY.

29:45.570 --> 29:48.368
- MY KID DOESN'T EAT CHEESE.

29:51.270 --> 29:52.919
- HOWDY.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.359
OH, HEY, YOU MUST BE
THE BUG GUY.

29:54.410 --> 29:55.923
- I'M HERE TO SET UP
FOR THE SHOW.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.825
- YEAH, SURE,
COME ON IN.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.088
YOU NEED SOME HELP THERE?

29:59.140 --> 30:00.129
- I SET UP BY MYSELF.

30:00.170 --> 30:02.923
- OKAY.
WOW, THAT'S A NICE RIG.

30:02.970 --> 30:04.517
I BET YOU GET THE LADYBUGS
WITH THAT ONE, HUH?

30:04.560 --> 30:06.585
- LADYBUGS ARE HERMAPHRODITIC.
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

30:06.630 --> 30:08.177
- HELLO, ANDY.
- YES, SETTING UP.

30:08.220 --> 30:09.938
[door shuts]

30:09.980 --> 30:11.595
- HEY.
- WELL, THAT GUY'S KIND OF RUDE.

30:11.630 --> 30:14.451
- WELL, ACTUALLY, DAD,
HE HAS ASPERGER'S.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.219
- OH, COME ON.
NO, HE DOESN'T.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.114
- DAD, HE HAS ASPERGER'S
LIKE MAX.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.185
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

30:21.230 --> 30:23.016
- AND HE'S GOT
HIS OWN BUSINESS THERE?

30:23.060 --> 30:24.288
- YEAH.
IT'S HIS OWN BUG...

30:24.330 --> 30:26.059
- NO TOUCHING
THE GLOSSY DISPLAY ELEMENTS.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.909
FINGERPRINTS. FINGERPRINTS.
- BUSINESS.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.097
- THAT'S GREAT.

30:29.130 --> 30:30.404
- YEAH, I HOPE SO,
'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY

30:30.440 --> 30:32.237
ABOUT A MILLION WAYS
THIS COULD GO WRONG

30:32.270 --> 30:34.090
AND SEND THIS ENTIRE PARTY
INTO A GIANT GROUP MELTDOWN.

30:34.140 --> 30:35.095
SO--
- OH, GOD!

30:35.140 --> 30:36.209
- YEAH, HONEY.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.377
- FINGERPRINTS.
FINGERPRINTS.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.444
NO TOUCHING.
NO TOUCHING.

30:38.490 --> 30:39.627
- GABY, IT'S AMAZING ANDY,

30:39.660 --> 30:41.890
AND HE'S--
HE'S AMAZING.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.419
- PLEASE, NO AUDIENCE YET.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.485
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOME OF THESE BEFORE.

30:45.530 --> 30:48.283
- TOO SOON FOR AUDIENCE.
TOO SOON FOR AUDIENCE.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.117
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE MUST LEAVE.

30:50.150 --> 30:52.084
I'M SETTING UP
THE PERFORMANCE SPACE.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.223
- YOU NEED A LITTLE HELP THERE?

30:53.260 --> 30:54.534
- I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

30:54.570 --> 30:57.130
- ARE YOU SURE? I CAN JUST GRAB
SOME OF THIS STUFF OVER HERE--

30:57.160 --> 30:59.014
- ALL AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
LEAVE THE AUDITORIUM, PLEASE.

30:59.060 --> 31:01.528
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ANDY.
I GOT IT.

31:01.580 --> 31:02.604
JOEL, YOU CAN'T FOOL
AROUND HERE.

31:02.650 --> 31:03.924
NO TOUCH--
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

31:03.960 --> 31:04.995
COME ON.
I GOT IT.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.474
- JOEL, BABY, HI, HI.

31:06.510 --> 31:07.898
COME HERE.
I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

31:07.930 --> 31:10.342
- UH-HUH.
- HEY. PAY ATTENTION.

31:10.380 --> 31:11.608
- YES.
- I JUST TOOK THE TEST.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.582
I'M OVULATING.
- WAIT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

31:13.630 --> 31:17.179
- YES. OH, YES.
- WAIT.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.142
UM...
- SO TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

31:19.180 --> 31:20.351
- REALLY?
- YES.

31:20.390 --> 31:23.382
- MM.
CAN RIGHT NOW BE THE NIGHT?

31:23.430 --> 31:25.216
- REALLY?
RIGHT NOW?

31:25.260 --> 31:28.320
- IT'S A LONG TIME
BEFORE THE BUG SHOW.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.248
- WE CAN'T DO THIS.

31:33.330 --> 31:35.025
- THANKS, HONEY.
- ARE YOU GOOD?

31:35.060 --> 31:36.266
- I'M GOOD.
- DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

31:36.300 --> 31:37.164
- JUST GOT A LITTLE HEADACHE.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.713
I'M TRYING TO GET HIM MOVING,
SO...

31:38.750 --> 31:40.229
H EY, AN DY.

31:40.270 --> 31:41.714
- YES.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.092
- LOOKS GREAT.
EVERYTHING LOOKS AMAZING.

31:44.140 --> 31:46.995
LISTEN, A COUPLE OF THE KIDS
HAVE TO LEAVE

31:47.040 --> 31:48.689
A LITTLE BIT EARLY,
SO I WAS WONDERING,

31:48.730 --> 31:49.822
I KNOW WE SAID
WE'D START AT 2:00,

31:49.870 --> 31:52.623
BUT IS THERE ANY WAY
WE COULD START 15 MINUTES EARLY?

31:52.660 --> 31:55.140
- WE SAID WE'D START AT 2:00.
IT'S NOT 2:00.

31:55.180 --> 31:58.115
- I KNOW.
BUT I-I'M SORRY

31:58.150 --> 31:59.708
THAT I'VE CHANGED THINGS UP
ON YOU.

31:59.740 --> 32:01.708
I JUST--I REALLY WANT
TO SHOW THESE KIDS YOUR SHOW

32:01.740 --> 32:03.184
'CAUSE THEY'RE SO EXCITED
TO SEE IT.

32:03.230 --> 32:05.016
- NO, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

32:09.030 --> 32:10.474
- OKAY.
- HEY.

32:10.510 --> 32:12.057
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

32:12.100 --> 32:13.579
- SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU
OUT WITH?

32:13.620 --> 32:17.238
- I'M JUST--
HE--I ASKED HIM

32:17.280 --> 32:19.089
TO START EARLY, AND HE
DOESN'T WANT TO START EARLY,

32:19.140 --> 32:20.960
SO--I THINK
I'VE UPSET HIM.

32:21.000 --> 32:21.967
- LET ME TRY.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.240
YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.269
- OKAY.
- I'VE JUST GOT A HEADACHE.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.766
- I'M GONNA GIVE IT A SHOT.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.075
- HEY, AN DY.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.351
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF MAYBE

32:31.390 --> 32:33.278
YOU'VE EVER HAD
TO START A PARTY

32:33.330 --> 32:34.774
EARLY OR LATE BEFORE
IN THE PAST.

32:34.810 --> 32:37.085
- YES, ON NOVEMBER 16TH,

32:37.120 --> 32:39.429
I STARTED
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATE

32:39.470 --> 32:41.222
BECAUSE I HAD TO GO HOME AND GET
THE CENTIPEDE I HAD FORGOT.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.148
- OH, REALLY?

32:43.200 --> 32:45.259
HOW'D THAT TURN OUT?

32:45.300 --> 32:47.234
EVERYTHING OKAY?
- IT WAS OKAY.

32:47.270 --> 32:48.783
IT WAS LATE.
- RIGHT.

32:48.820 --> 32:51.163
BUT EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

32:51.210 --> 32:52.996
OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
MAYBE WE TRY THAT AGAIN.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.611
LET'S START A LITTLE BIT EARLY,
AND I BET YOU

32:55.660 --> 32:56.934
IT TURNS OUT OKAY
JUST LIKE THE LAST ONE.

32:56.970 --> 33:00.144
- BUT I DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT,
BECAUSE THE CONTRACT SAYS 2:00.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.454
- RIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY.

33:01.490 --> 33:03.549
BUT SOMETIMES THINGS CHANGE...
- AND I NEED TIME TO GET READY.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.555
- AND YOU HAVE
TO HELP PEOPLE OUT.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.737
ABSOLUTELY.

33:05.770 --> 33:07.078
I'LL LET YOU GET READY.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.395
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

33:09.430 --> 33:10.772
- OKAY.

33:10.810 --> 33:13.324
- THANK YOU, ANDY.
OKAY.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.299
DO I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY FACE?

33:19.340 --> 33:21.160
- YOU RULE.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.259
- I RULE? THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

33:23.310 --> 33:25.062
- YOU'RE PRETTY COOL YOURSELF.

33:35.730 --> 33:37.243
- OH, GOD.
- OH, MY GOD.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.518
- OKAY.
- KRISTINA, HI.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.528
HI.
- I'M SO SORRY.

33:40.570 --> 33:42.709
- I'M SORRY.
NO, I'M OVULATING.

33:42.740 --> 33:44.150
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A BABY.
- I UNDERSTAND.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.418
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

33:45.470 --> 33:47.256
I JUST CAME TO GET SOME ASPIRIN.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.801
JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

33:48.850 --> 33:50.533
DO YOU WANT TO USE THE BED?

33:50.580 --> 33:51.808
- NO. THAT'S OKAY.

33:51.850 --> 33:52.839
- THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.
- I'M GONNA JUST GO.

33:52.890 --> 33:54.050
- OKAY. BYE.

33:54.100 --> 33:54.919
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS THE PART

33:54.960 --> 33:56.336
WHERE YOU PRESENT ME
TO THE AUDIENCE.

33:56.370 --> 33:57.541
- OKAY.
- YOU HAVE TO READ THIS SPEECH.

33:57.580 --> 33:59.548
NO, READ IT TO ME.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.060
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
"WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

34:02.100 --> 34:04.307
BOYS AND GIRLS.
IT IS MY DEEPEST PLEASURE--"

34:04.350 --> 34:06.136
- THAT'S GONNA BE GOOD,
BUT YOU NEED TO BE WAY LOUDER.

34:06.180 --> 34:08.273
AND YOU CAN HOLD IT IN ONE HAND,
AND THEN YOUR OTHER HAND

34:08.320 --> 34:09.344
CAN BE LIKE A POINTER.

34:09.390 --> 34:10.550
- OKAY, OKAY, YOU READY?

WONDERFUL WORLD OF BUGS.

35:09.830 --> 35:11.718
WHEN I SAY THE WORD "BUG,"

35:11.760 --> 35:14.615
YOU THINK OF SOMETHING CREEPY
AND SCARY.

35:14.660 --> 35:16.935
- RIGHT?

35:24.530 --> 35:26.418
[kids talking softly]

35:26.460 --> 35:28.257
THIS IS THE LARGEST SPIDER
IN MY COLLECTION.

35:28.290 --> 35:30.599
WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW

35:30.640 --> 35:32.153
IS THAT ON YOUR OWN CONTINENT

35:32.190 --> 35:34.226
OF NORTH AMERICA--
- THERE ARE OVER 30 SPECIES.

35:34.270 --> 35:36.363
- THERE ARE AS MANY
AS 30 SPECIES.

35:36.410 --> 35:38.162

HAVE TOXIC BITES.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.680
- EXACTLY. NO COMMENTS
FROM THE AUDIENCE, PLEASE.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.757
I HOPE HE DOESN'T GET AWAY

35:51.700 --> 35:53.759

35:53.800 --> 35:55.415
AT YOUR HOUSE,
WHICH I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

35:55.460 --> 35:58.247
- QUITE AMAZING.
- MM.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.427
- THAT'S THE MADAGASCAR
HISSING COCKROACH.

35:59.460 --> 36:02.702
- THIS IS A MADAGASCAR
HISSING COCKROACH.

36:02.740 --> 36:06.187
WHEN HE'S THREATENED,
HE CAN SQUEEZE AIR OUT

36:06.230 --> 36:07.436
THROUGH THEIR EXOSKELETON.
IT MAKES A LOUD--

36:07.470 --> 36:09.222
- HISSING SOUND.
- [hisses]

36:09.270 --> 36:10.191
[all gasping]

36:10.230 --> 36:11.299
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE AT ALL.

36:11.340 --> 36:13.433
IT'S MORE LIKE A...

36:13.480 --> 36:16.199
- THIS IS THE BEST BUG SHOW
I'VE EVER SEEN.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.616
- THIS IS A PRESERVED SPECIMEN

36:17.650 --> 36:18.992
OF THE HERCULES BEETLE.

36:19.030 --> 36:20.759
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THAT?
YOU CAN TELL THIS IS A MALE,

36:20.790 --> 36:24.658
'CAUSE IT HAS THIS LONG HORN
ON THE FRONT OF IT.

36:24.690 --> 36:28.239
- WHAT'S UP?
- NOTHING.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.554
THEY WERE JUST BANGING
IN THE BATHROOM.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.807
- WHO?
- JOEL AND JULIA WERE HAVING SEX

36:31.840 --> 36:32.977
IN OUR BATHROOM.
HONEY, DON'T.

36:33.010 --> 36:33.874
DON'T EMBARRASS THEM.

36:33.910 --> 36:36.663
- THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT
OF A HUMAN BEING

36:36.710 --> 36:40.259
LIFTING UP TWO SHERMAN TANKS
UP IN THE AIR.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.949
all: WOW.
- IT'S KIND OF EXCITING, THOUGH.

36:41.990 --> 36:44.333
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHAT IF A CHILD IS CONCEIVED

36:44.370 --> 36:46.679
ON MAX'S BIRTH DAY.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.369
- I THINK I'LL JUST HAVE
A SIP OF COFFEE RIGHT NOW.

36:48.410 --> 36:52.540
OH, NO!
IT'S NOT COFFEE.

36:55.790 --> 36:57.587
- MIXING UP ALL
THOSE INGREDIENTS IN THERE...

36:57.620 --> 36:59.417
- MM-HMM.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.793
- SEEING WHAT COMES OUT.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.241
- ONE PERFECT KID.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.314
- WHO WANTS TO SHAKE?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.804
[children screaming]
HOW DO YOU DO?

37:07.840 --> 37:10.456
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?

37:10.500 --> 37:13.355

37:29.860 --> 37:31.487

IT WASN'T JUST THE BUGS.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.680

37:32.730 --> 37:36.621
IT'S ALSO GREAT
THAT YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING

37:36.660 --> 37:37.797
THAT YOU LOVE TO DO.

37:41.390 --> 37:44.939

38:18.910 --> 38:20.320
- NO, I BREAK DOWN
BY MYSELF.

38:20.360 --> 38:25.559
- OKAY.

38:25.610 --> 38:27.328

38:27.370 --> 38:28.883

AS BUG PARTIES GO,

38:28.920 --> 38:30.535
WHERE WOULD YOU RANK

I WANT TO--
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU

39:42.200 --> 39:47.923

VERY EASY TO DO, SO...
