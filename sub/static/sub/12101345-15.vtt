WEBVTT

00:59.267 --> 01:00.435
Where are we going?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.523
-You'll find out soon enough.
-

01:05.607 --> 01:07.692
And so will your squad.

01:07.776 --> 01:11.446
Using my comm won't work.
They'll know it's a trap.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.450
They'll still come for you.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.213
-Spanner wrench.
-

01:28.296 --> 01:29.964
This is taking too long.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.925
Omega, focus.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.051
I can't.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.804
We have to get back
to Daro and rescue Hunter.

01:35.887 --> 01:39.849
We will, but we can't go anywhere
until the ship's fixed.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.267
Hand me the spanner.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.525
That should do it.

01:49.734 --> 01:50.735
The hull's patched.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.904
Nearly finished getting
the systems online.

01:52.987 --> 01:56.157
I left Gregor with Cid.
She wasn't too happy about it.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.826
What else is new?

01:57.909 --> 01:58.910
We are up and running.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.745
Let's go get Hunter.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.626
His communication device
has just been activated.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.586
It appears he is no longer on Daro.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.506
What do you mean? Where is he?

02:38.616 --> 02:39.868
Where are the rest of them?

02:39.951 --> 02:41.828
They'll be here.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.663
We'll intercept upon arrival.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.542
So you're the one they call "Hunter."

02:48.168 --> 02:52.047
The destruction your squad caused
on Ryloth got my attention.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.593
I leave this to you, Commander.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.470
Stay on schedule.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.731
I question the clone's motives
with his old squad.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.524
I don't trust any of them.

03:11.608 --> 03:15.111
If his plan fails, none of them
will be a problem any longer.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.696
Keep an eye on things.

03:16.780 --> 03:17.864
Yes, Admiral.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.333
Activating Hunter's comm was intentional.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.752
The Empire wants us to come to Kamino.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.213
I am uncertain as to why.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.048
No turning back now.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.217
Are you positive about these coordinates?

03:37.300 --> 03:41.638
Yes. I told you. They're to a landing pad
that we can use in Tipoca City.

03:41.721 --> 03:45.642
Every platform down there
will be swarming with troopers.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.894
Not this one. Trust me.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.070
I'm only seeing three cruisers.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.780
Where's the rest of the fleet?

03:58.863 --> 04:01.199
Who cares? That's a good thing.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.034
Locking onto the coordinates.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.876
Hang on. This is going to get bumpy.

04:30.186 --> 04:33.732
We are at the given coordinates, Omega.
There is nothing here.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.108
You have to get lower.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.904
Lower.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.785
If I go any lower,
we will be in the water.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.455
It's the only way
to activate the platform.

04:48.538 --> 04:52.208
Hold on. Scanners are picking up
a large structure directly beneath us.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.904
Never doubted you for a second, kid.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.407
Landing was only one problem.
How are we going to get into the city?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.993
We'll take the tube system.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.119
The what?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.264
Come on.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.392
Nice.

06:23.425 --> 06:28.179
This type of underwater transport system
is not documented on any schematics.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.598
Kaminoans keep a lot of secrets.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.058
Indeed.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.519
Omega, how did you know this existed?

06:34.602 --> 06:36.396
Nala Se.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.566
This tunnel leads
to her private research lab.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.401
The others run throughout Kamino.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.197
You, uh, all right?

06:46.865 --> 06:49.784
It doesn't matter.
Saving Hunter is what matters.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.132
Where are all the regs?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.885
When did you start caring about them?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.596
No Kaminoans either.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.350
This facility's being decommissioned.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.103
You don't seem too concerned.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.897
Why would I be?

07:19.439 --> 07:23.026
Because the Empire will be
phasing out clones next.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.403
Not the ones that matter.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.088
A ship was detected entering the system,
but we lost them below scanner range.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.673
It's them.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.883
I'll notify the scouts.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.095
Don't bother. They'll come to us.

07:50.178 --> 07:54.599
They don't leave their own behind,
most of the time.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.268
You tried to kill us.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.021
We didn't have a choice.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.773
Hmm.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.066
And I did?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.797
That looks like every other
Kaminoan lab to me.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.966
Not exactly.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.218
Most in Tipoca City don't know about it.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.972
Hunter's comm is still active.
I'll pinpoint his location.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.974
I'll tap into the system.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.058
I don't get it.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.811
What's so special about this lab?

08:40.353 --> 08:41.855
It's where I was created.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.107
Here?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.735
You all were here too.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.570
What do you mean?

08:49.237 --> 08:51.656
Your mutations were enhanced in this room.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.035
Experimental Unit 99 began right here.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.495
I was there.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.374
Is that true?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.752
How could I possibly know that?

09:03.835 --> 09:05.670
It was only for a short time,

09:06.254 --> 09:08.548
before you were sent
to be with the other clones.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.344
Something's not right.

09:12.427 --> 09:16.139
All the central files have been wiped.
There's nothing in the system.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.850
-Anyone else think that's weird?
-

09:23.521 --> 09:25.815
Do not shoot! I am AZI-345211--

09:25.899 --> 09:26.900
AZI?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.611
Omega, I am relieved it is you.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.863
What are you doing down here?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.156
I am in hiding.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.783
Soldiers were deactivating droids

09:34.866 --> 09:38.495
and forcing key Kaminoan
medical personnel onto transports.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.497
Those who resisted were eliminated.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.540
The clones did that?

09:42.624 --> 09:45.210
No, these were other soldiers.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.296
All clone troopers were reassigned
and transferred off-world,

09:48.380 --> 09:50.465
with the exception of CT-9904.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.634
Crosshair's here?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.427
Should've known.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.805
It is not safe here, Omega.

09:56.888 --> 09:57.931
You must leave.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.600
We can't. Not without Hunter.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.020
Found him. His comm is pinging
from the central cloning platform.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.189
Come on, AZI. You're with us.

10:14.572 --> 10:19.035
Crosshair,
I've seen what the Empire's doing,

10:19.828 --> 10:23.665
occupying planets and silencing
anyone who stands against them.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.376
You know it's not right.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.713
You still don't see the bigger picture,

10:30.505 --> 10:32.090
but you will.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.010
Can't you see they're using you?

10:36.386 --> 10:38.638
It's that inhibitor chip in your head.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.558
-It's making you follow--
-

10:41.641 --> 10:44.060
We have an unauthorized entry
on platform 5.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.062
Right on schedule.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.940
Time to go.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.816
AZI,
you said all the clone troopers were gone.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.652
Correct. Those are not clone troopers.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.239
They're TK troopers, like on Daro.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.957
Wait. Hunter's on the move. This way.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.937
According to the comm signal,
Hunter is directly above us.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.357
The training room?
That's open ground.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.776
If Crosshair's waiting, he'll pick us off.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.361
Oh, he's waiting.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.698
Precisely why we will not be going in
through the main entrance,

12:19.781 --> 12:21.032
like he would expect.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.076
We'll enter through the lift.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.578
That should give us a slight advantage.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.788
Omega, wait here.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.957
No, we should stick together.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.750
No, Echo's right.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.877
Crosshair's after us, not you.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.879
Stay out of sight.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.590
If things go south,
we'll send you a signal.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.176
Get back to the ship and contact Rex.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.188
Well, guess you were wrong about that.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.067
And here we all are, together again.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.778
You won't be needing your weapons.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.664
See?

13:10.290 --> 13:13.043
Following orders isn't so difficult.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.049
Where's your little sidekick?

13:22.510 --> 13:23.928
We're smarter than that.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.140
Lying was never your strength, Wrecker.

13:27.682 --> 13:28.683
Find the kid.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.273
-It's the signal.

13:35.357 --> 13:39.277
Per CT-1409's instructions,
we should flee to the research lab.

13:39.361 --> 13:42.864
No. Something went wrong.
We have to help them.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.159
But that means we will also be in danger.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.660
Focus, AZI.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.876
I have an idea.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.306
We're running out of time, Commander.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.684
Hold your positions.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.811
So this was your grand plan?

14:12.894 --> 14:14.854
Bring us here and kill us?

14:14.938 --> 14:18.692
If I wanted you dead, you would be.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.444
Not that it wouldn't be justified.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.823
You betrayed everything we stood for.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.910
And for what? The Republic?

14:29.494 --> 14:33.707
We're loyal to each other,
not some Empire.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.501
You weren't loyal to me.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.672
I was one of you.

14:40.755 --> 14:44.467
You may have forgotten, but I haven't.

14:44.551 --> 14:49.556
And it's why I'm going to give you
what you never gave me:

14:50.765 --> 14:52.183
a chance.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.992
I think I've almost got it.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.910
-[ES-02] Freeze.
-[gasps]

15:11.870 --> 15:13.788
Uh, hello.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.042
Sir, I've found the girl.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.919
Send her on a shuttle off-world.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.546
Crosshair, don't.

15:21.629 --> 15:25.300
It's for her own good. And yours.

15:25.383 --> 15:28.178
Omega belongs with us.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.682
Living among fugitives
where she's in constant danger?

15:32.766 --> 15:37.103
You want to protect the kid,
then let her go.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.899
Stop pretending to be
something you're not, Hunter.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.610
We're not like the regs.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.111
We never have been.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.697
We're superior.

15:48.448 --> 15:52.202
The Empire can't protect the galaxy
without strength.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.789
This is what we were made for.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.708
Think of all we could do

15:59.667 --> 16:00.752
together.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.213
We were brothers once.

16:06.675 --> 16:07.926
We can be again.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.311
Why would we trust you?

16:22.524 --> 16:23.775
Stand down.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.820
Negative, Commander.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.670
Does that answer your question?

16:47.549 --> 16:48.925
I said move it.

16:49.009 --> 16:53.221
I'm kinda in the middle of something.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.188
I did it.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.482
Nice work, AZI.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.692
Now let's hurry.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.781
You all are meant for more
than drifting through the galaxy.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.200
It's time to stop running.

17:15.035 --> 17:19.539
Join the Empire,
and you will have purpose again.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.004
You really don't get who we are, do you?

17:26.880 --> 17:30.050
Don't make the same mistake twice.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.178
Don't become my enemy.

17:34.387 --> 17:38.308
Crosshair, we never were.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.657
Hey, why did you activate the droids?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.159
This was not my doing.

18:01.956 --> 18:05.251
I believe you may have activated
a few too many droids.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.836
I can see that, AZI.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.505
Admiral, the commander lost control
of the situation.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.716
Pull all remaining forces out.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.051
Let the clones die together.

19:28.752 --> 19:32.047
All essential personnel have been
removed from Kamino.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.673
And the chief scientist?

19:33.757 --> 19:34.758
Secured.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.261
The cloning technology is now
firmly under Imperial control.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.680
Very good, Admiral.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.640
You may fire when ready.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.064
Move into position.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.277
Crosshair, forget the Empire.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.738
This isn't you.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.825
It's your inhibitor chip.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.077
We can help you.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.496
Wrong.

20:47.163 --> 20:52.377
I had my chip removed a long time ago.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.757
Since when?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.634
Does it matter?

20:59.718 --> 21:00.760
Yes.

21:02.012 --> 21:04.931
This is who I am.

21:20.697 --> 21:21.948
Sorry, Omega.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.535
I know I promised you'd never have
to come back here.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.829
You did the same for me.

21:40.425 --> 21:44.179
Hunter, three Venators are descending
on the city. We need to leave, now.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.810
Wrecker, grab Crosshair.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.645
He's coming with us.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.260
Sir, we're in position.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.388
Open fire.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.858
Hurry! Get to the lift!

22:44.364 --> 22:45.699
Back inside! Go!
