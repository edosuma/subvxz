WEBVTT

00:01.053 --> 00:02.457
[Malory] Blackmail?

00:02.458 --> 00:04.417
[Veronica] Yes, I... I'm afraid so.

00:04.418 --> 00:07.477
You see, last night, thieves
burgled the house of my attorney, Al...

00:07.478 --> 00:09.417
- Alan Shapiro.
- Why, yes.

00:09.418 --> 00:11.577
But how did you know that Mr.
Shapiro was my attorney?

00:11.578 --> 00:12.590
Yeah, Cyril.

00:12.615 --> 00:15.627
Oh. Uh, so, the reason I know that is...

00:15.628 --> 00:19.547
- He's an idiot.
- Savant. Photographic memory.

00:19.548 --> 00:21.593
My guess is he read that in a newspaper

00:21.618 --> 00:23.637
article years ago and never forgot it.

00:23.638 --> 00:25.873
But, you know, many of the world's

00:25.898 --> 00:28.427
great detectives were on the spectrum.

00:28.428 --> 00:28.967
Wait. What?

00:28.968 --> 00:32.467
Sherlock Holmes, um, Darryl Zero...

00:32.468 --> 00:34.517
Please forgive me. I had no idea.

00:34.518 --> 00:36.427
Really? Look at his clothes.

00:36.428 --> 00:38.627
- Hey, you know what...
- [shushing] There, there.

00:38.628 --> 00:40.932
At any rate, um, whoever these

00:40.957 --> 00:43.467
people were, they stole, um...

00:43.468 --> 00:46.547
My goodness, look at me. I'm...
I'm shaking like a leaf.

00:46.548 --> 00:49.427
- Would you care for a drink?
- Archer, it's barely nine o'...

00:49.428 --> 00:51.557
Corpse Reviver №2, please. But
if you don't have real absinthe,

00:51.558 --> 00:53.557
I'll have a double sidecar, French.

00:53.558 --> 00:55.517
Oh, that sounds good. I'll have...

00:55.518 --> 00:56.607
- There's not enough.
- You were saying?

00:56.608 --> 00:58.447
They stole...

00:58.448 --> 01:00.627
Yes. Um, I suppose you could call it

01:00.628 --> 01:02.637
very sensitive information.

01:02.638 --> 01:04.607
On a computer disk?

01:04.608 --> 01:06.605
Well, yes, but surely you didn't

01:06.630 --> 01:08.477
read that in the newspaper.

01:08.478 --> 01:11.447
Intuition and a photographic memory.

01:11.448 --> 01:13.721
It's remarkable, but it can be a bit...

01:13.746 --> 01:14.517
Off-putting?

01:14.518 --> 01:16.447
Cyril, get up. Move.

01:16.448 --> 01:19.487
Ms. Deane came here for
help, not to be off-put.

01:19.488 --> 01:22.558
Now, then, this sensitive information...

01:24.518 --> 01:25.638
- Sterling!
- [clears throat]

01:27.558 --> 01:30.517
Um, yes. So, about the disk...

01:30.518 --> 01:32.517
You want to get back at us.

01:32.518 --> 01:34.597
- You want us to get it back.
- No, Mr. Archer.

01:34.598 --> 01:36.775
I need you to get it back,

01:36.800 --> 01:38.617
- desperately.
- [gulp]

01:38.618 --> 01:40.952
Which is an excellent segue into a

01:40.977 --> 01:43.487
brief overview of our fee structure.

01:43.488 --> 01:45.607
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- Wow, that was brief.

01:45.608 --> 01:47.487
Payable upon delivery.

01:47.488 --> 01:49.487
Now, if you will excuse me, I...

01:49.488 --> 01:51.497
I think we might have more questions.

01:51.498 --> 01:53.627
I'm sure you do, but Mr.
Shapiro will have to answer them.

01:53.628 --> 01:55.567
He's waiting for you at his house now.

01:55.568 --> 01:58.587
- The house that got robbed?
- "Burgled," Lana. Pay attention.

01:58.588 --> 02:01.427
And so, Miss Deane, do
you want me to ride with you?

02:01.428 --> 02:02.587
Because my car is currently...

02:02.588 --> 02:04.417
- Merde.
- No!

02:04.418 --> 02:05.627
No, Mr. Archer. Mr. Shapiro

02:05.628 --> 02:08.407
will handle everything from now on.

02:08.407 --> 02:10.407
And if all goes according to plan,

02:10.407 --> 02:12.567
this will be the last time we ever meet.

02:12.568 --> 02:16.417
- Wait. No. Ever?
- I am standing right here.

02:16.418 --> 02:19.587
Yeah, exactly, when clearly we're
almost out of triple sec,

02:19.588 --> 02:21.588

[Archer] Okay, so, what do we know?

[Lana] Um, old ladies give you a boner?

03:03.618 --> 03:05.467

03:05.468 --> 03:08.427
No. And shut up. And, Krieger, come on.

- Away.

- Wh...

And we have to meet Shapiro in two

03:19.569 --> 03:21.587
hours ago, so can we please focus?

03:21.588 --> 03:24.437
Well, we know that
someone posing as Veronica Deane

03:24.438 --> 03:26.467
tricked us into stealing a computer disk

03:26.468 --> 03:29.437
in order to blackmail the
real Veronica Deane.

03:29.438 --> 03:30.954
And paid us with a bogus cashier's check

03:30.979 --> 03:32.507
for a hundred thousand dollars, which...

03:32.508 --> 03:34.239
- Why the hell are you doing that?
- What?

03:34.264 --> 03:35.527
You just said it was bogus!

03:35.528 --> 03:37.427
I don't know. Fingerprints?

03:37.428 --> 03:39.607
Well? Who am I, Alphonse Bertillon?

03:39.608 --> 03:41.665
Uh, so I'm just gonna kind of power

03:41.690 --> 03:43.607
through this, if you don't mind.

03:43.608 --> 03:45.487
Whatever. Jesus.

03:45.488 --> 03:47.627
Okay, so, now, the
real Veronica Deane...

03:47.628 --> 03:49.577
How do you know she's the real one?

03:49.578 --> 03:51.567
Oh, she's definitely the real thing.

03:51.568 --> 03:54.497
Please, you can't fake that desperate,

03:54.498 --> 03:56.517
actressy craving for attention.

03:56.518 --> 03:58.538
What you can't fake, Mother, is her

03:58.563 --> 04:00.557
star power, her palpable charisma.

04:00.558 --> 04:02.067
Well, I'm gonna fake being here and

04:02.092 --> 04:03.617
go pick up our daughter at daycare.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.527
Well, then, you can fake getting paid.

04:05.528 --> 04:08.557
- Excuse me?
- You're no longer on Malory's teat.

04:08.558 --> 04:10.447
- Ew!
- Cyril!

04:10.448 --> 04:12.437
[sighs] Never gonna be able to stand up.

04:12.438 --> 04:14.477
You work at the Figgis Agency now.

04:14.478 --> 04:16.557
And around here, you
don't work-a the case,

04:16.558 --> 04:19.416
you don't get-a the... the paycheck.

04:19.418 --> 04:20.617
Boom! Fridge magnet.

04:20.618 --> 04:22.067
I'm sorry. Did Veronica Deane

04:22.093 --> 04:23.567
spray a bunch of pheromones

04:23.568 --> 04:26.497
that somehow raised all
your testosterone levels?

04:26.498 --> 04:28.702
That is exactly what it feels like.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.437
Oh, yeah.

04:29.438 --> 04:31.407
I feel like I could
fight a grizzly bear,

04:31.408 --> 04:33.497
like, over a parking space. [growls]

04:33.498 --> 04:35.011
Is the bear, like, standing in the

04:35.036 --> 04:36.567
space or actually driving the car?

04:36.568 --> 04:38.577
- Doesn't matter.
- I mean... Really!

04:38.578 --> 04:40.466
Does it matter that if we don't get

04:40.491 --> 04:42.407
that disk for that snooty has-been,

04:42.408 --> 04:43.537
we'll have to shut off the lights?

04:43.538 --> 04:45.547
- How will that help?
- Not to mention,

04:45.548 --> 04:46.981
it's kind of our fault the disk

04:47.006 --> 04:48.507
was stolen in the first place.

04:48.508 --> 04:51.447
[sighs] Since we stole it. Okay.

04:51.448 --> 04:53.427
- Okay, so...
- Cyril, shut up.

04:53.428 --> 04:54.378
Sterling and Lana, go meet

04:54.403 --> 04:55.547
Shapiro and then report back.

04:55.548 --> 04:57.970
Uh, before or after he recognizes us

04:57.995 --> 05:00.457
as the people that robbed his house?

05:00.458 --> 05:01.773
"Burgled." And it was pitch

05:01.798 --> 05:03.527
black, and we all had on goggles.

05:03.528 --> 05:06.417
So calm down. Nobody's
gonna recognize us.

05:06.418 --> 05:07.527
[growling]

05:07.528 --> 05:09.607
Duner! Blits! Keyn! Nit faynt!

05:09.608 --> 05:12.577
- [barks]
- Hey, buddies.

05:12.578 --> 05:15.417
- Nit faynt! Keyn! Keyn!
- [yipping]

05:15.418 --> 05:17.627
- God, that is so weird.
- Yeah.

05:17.628 --> 05:19.637
- Are they not housebroken, or...
- What?

05:19.638 --> 05:22.427
No. No. Sorry. No. Come on in.

05:22.428 --> 05:25.427
Oh, shoes. Shoes, shoes. Thank you.

05:25.428 --> 05:26.432
No, the growling. They have

05:26.457 --> 05:27.547
never done that to a guest.

05:27.548 --> 05:29.360
And they are extremely well trained.

05:29.385 --> 05:30.437
Ex-Mossad, actually.

05:30.438 --> 05:31.849
But if you mean the diapers, then

05:31.874 --> 05:33.467
yes, because whoever broke in here...

05:33.468 --> 05:35.045
And I say "whoever,"
because it was pitch black,

05:35.070 --> 05:36.557
and they were
wearing some kind of goggles...

05:36.558 --> 05:37.948
- [fake cough] Called it.
- when

05:37.973 --> 05:39.587
they poisoned my goddamn dogs!

05:39.588 --> 05:40.977
- What?
- Yeah, the vet thinks it

05:41.002 --> 05:42.557
was some kind of tranquilizer.

05:42.558 --> 05:44.557
But they had a bad reaction,
and all night the poor things

05:44.558 --> 05:47.417
were just crazy
shitting, uncontrollably.

05:47.418 --> 05:48.627
I mean, like fire hoses, seriously.

05:48.628 --> 05:51.189
It was all through here, down that

05:51.214 --> 05:53.457
hallway, all down the stairs.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.527
Some got way up on that wall somehow.

05:55.528 --> 05:57.159
And there was all this blood splashed

05:57.184 --> 05:58.447
everywhere from the burglar.

05:58.448 --> 05:59.407
I swear to God, it was like a

05:59.432 --> 06:00.597
Family Circus cartoon up in here.

06:00.598 --> 06:03.627
The ones where they follow
Billy all around the neighborhood,

06:03.628 --> 06:06.557
only with blood and watery dog shit.

06:06.558 --> 06:08.507
And so, the maids cleaned all night.

06:08.508 --> 06:10.427
That's only because I
threatened to have them deported.

06:10.428 --> 06:11.597
They've been with me at least...

06:11.598 --> 06:14.447
Oh, wow. Rosa's been with me 20 years.

06:14.448 --> 06:16.447
[chuckles] Anyway, the vet just left.

06:16.448 --> 06:18.001
They were so dehydrated. We had 'em

06:18.026 --> 06:19.467
on IV drips, the whole megillah.

06:19.468 --> 06:21.477
- The maids?
- Th... The dogs!

06:21.478 --> 06:24.467
Oh, my God, I am so sorry...

06:24.468 --> 06:25.627
that that happened.

06:25.628 --> 06:28.567
I'll tell you who's
sorry, is my flokati rug.

06:28.568 --> 06:30.740
Oh, and my worthless bodyguards.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.437
Right. And they are...

06:32.438 --> 06:34.530
Fired! And lucky they're not slowly

06:34.555 --> 06:36.447
dissolving in a 50-gallon drum!

06:36.448 --> 06:38.437
She trusted me!

06:38.438 --> 06:39.538
Veronica trusted me to protect

06:39.563 --> 06:40.637
the disk, and I failed her!

06:40.638 --> 06:42.606
Okay, well, maybe. But we're gonna

06:42.631 --> 06:44.517
get it back, right, with a plan?

06:44.518 --> 06:46.557
[exhaling]

06:46.558 --> 06:50.477
Yes. I'm sorry. Those vermin
called this morning,

06:50.478 --> 06:52.597
gave me instructions on
where to bring this...

06:52.598 --> 06:55.417
two million dollars in bearer bonds.

06:55.418 --> 06:57.517
Holy shit, we should've kept the disk.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.517
Safe... from the bad guys.

06:59.518 --> 07:02.437
And by "we," obviously I meant "you."

07:02.438 --> 07:03.557
So...

07:03.558 --> 07:06.557
Wow. Hurtful.

07:06.558 --> 07:08.457
Okay, let's go meet these bastards.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.457
Okay. A, you won't need that.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.527
And B, we need to check
in with the agency.

07:12.528 --> 07:14.143
Or... roll with me... we don't

07:14.168 --> 07:15.597
check in yet, or at all,

07:15.598 --> 07:17.441
which means we decide how many

07:17.466 --> 07:19.407
hours we worked on this case,

07:19.408 --> 07:21.587
and not Cyril, who, I
hate to bring this up,

07:21.588 --> 07:24.507
just this morning, in
front of everybody,

07:24.508 --> 07:27.448
made you his giant bitch.

07:29.428 --> 07:31.467
Well, you two coming, or what?

07:31.468 --> 07:33.527
Okay. They said come
alone, but I don't drive,

07:33.528 --> 07:35.447
so they said I could bring my chauffeur.

07:35.448 --> 07:37.587
So somebody gets a snappy uniform,

07:37.588 --> 07:40.467
and somebody else gets
to hide in the trunk.

07:40.468 --> 07:42.588
[English accent] I trust
milady shan't be

07:42.613 --> 07:44.607
overly discomfited whilst in the boot.

07:44.608 --> 07:46.996
I bet you get this all the time, but

07:47.021 --> 07:49.577
have you ever done any modeling, or...

07:49.578 --> 07:53.527
Oh, and just so you
know, a woman chauffeur is a...

07:53.528 --> 07:55.487
- ow...
- [horn honks]

07:55.488 --> 07:57.487
Chauffeuse,

07:57.488 --> 07:59.418
you dumb idiots.

08:04.456 --> 08:06.838
[Malory] Wait. What?

08:06.839 --> 08:08.038
What do you mean, they
haven't checked in?

08:08.039 --> 08:11.858
- Uhhh...
- [chair squeaking]

08:11.859 --> 08:13.998
I mean that...

08:13.999 --> 08:16.058
they haven't checked in.

08:16.059 --> 08:18.058
Wha... So no one's heard from them?

08:18.059 --> 08:20.838
- Uh-uuhhh.
- No-o-ope.

08:20.839 --> 08:22.858
So we've got two agents in the field...

08:22.859 --> 08:24.362
"Investigators"! I thought I

08:24.387 --> 08:25.918
was very clear about that.

08:25.919 --> 08:28.008
And also about how excessive spinning

08:28.009 --> 08:29.978
causes premature wear on the bearings!

08:29.979 --> 08:31.019
- Cyril...
- And I bet they

08:31.041 --> 08:32.008
haven't checked in,

08:32.009 --> 08:33.503
because they're trying to stick it to

08:33.528 --> 08:34.918
the man, who, in this case, is me.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.008
- And in this case only.
- Stop spinning!

08:37.009 --> 08:38.239
- Cyril, you stop.
- What,

08:38.264 --> 08:40.028
protecting innocent bearings?

08:40.029 --> 08:41.908
- Being yourself!
- What?

08:41.909 --> 08:43.898
[both] Ooohh!

08:43.899 --> 08:46.048
- Excuse me?
- Cyril, you have been given

08:46.049 --> 08:48.048
the opportunity of a lifetime...

08:48.049 --> 08:50.978
a new job, a new city
where no one knows you,

08:50.979 --> 08:53.008
which means you can reinvent yourself.

08:53.009 --> 08:55.948
You can be anyone you want.

08:55.949 --> 08:59.048
So why would you keep being you?

08:59.049 --> 09:00.858
Huh.

09:00.859 --> 09:02.008
And that goes for the rest of you.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.898
Don't be the same feckless
idiots you were

09:04.899 --> 09:06.858
when this was a spy agency.

09:06.859 --> 09:07.968
[chairs squeaking]

09:07.969 --> 09:09.978
Oh, come on. Just literally yesterday,

09:09.979 --> 09:11.982
you were all so excited about your

09:12.007 --> 09:13.928
first case, and now look at you.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.928
[whirring]

09:15.929 --> 09:17.851
So get off your collective ass and

09:17.876 --> 09:19.938
get me a sit-rep on my field agents!

09:19.939 --> 09:21.028
"Investigators."

09:21.029 --> 09:23.958
I am, you know, still the boss.

09:23.959 --> 09:27.878
Well, but only when I'm not here.

09:27.879 --> 09:29.978
[Lana] Okay, I think we're here.

09:29.979 --> 09:31.988
[Archer] Do you? Do
you think that, Lana?

09:31.989 --> 09:34.828
Calm down, Fran Trunkington.

09:34.829 --> 09:36.018
- Forced.
- Oh, for the...

09:36.019 --> 09:38.828
- Trunky Brewster, then.
- Ehh!

09:38.829 --> 09:40.109
Oh, man, I hope that's not them.

09:42.029 --> 09:44.018
Although that seems unrealistic.

09:44.019 --> 09:47.918
Okay, Archer, we've got
nine... check that... ten bandits, 12:00.

09:47.919 --> 09:50.018
Copy that, Mav. What's the hard deck?

09:50.019 --> 09:52.028
Okay, you know what? [sighs]

09:52.029 --> 09:55.919
Never mind. Come on, Poppin' Fresh.

09:57.909 --> 10:00.898
- Are you coming?
- Are you gonna open my door?

10:00.899 --> 10:02.918
- [laughing]
- I know, right? She's like...

10:02.919 --> 10:04.918
[grunts] Ow!

10:04.919 --> 10:07.838
So, are you and Archer,

10:07.839 --> 10:09.918
- you know?
- [sighs] Unfortunately.

10:09.919 --> 10:11.829
You the Jew lawyer?

10:16.829 --> 10:18.391
[sighs] Yes. Yes. I believe

10:18.416 --> 10:19.838
we spoke on the phone.

10:19.839 --> 10:21.828
- You got the money?
- Yes.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.166
Two million dollars in bearer

10:23.191 --> 10:24.918
bonds, as per our verbal agreement.

10:24.919 --> 10:26.928
- What are you doing? Get the disk.
- [man laughing]

10:26.929 --> 10:29.948
Oh, well, get a load of Miss Daisy.

10:29.949 --> 10:31.888
[men laughing]

10:31.889 --> 10:33.859
- Ehh.
- Now, you give the

10:33.884 --> 10:35.828
case to Ocho there,

10:35.829 --> 10:39.998
and I'll give Miss Daisy the D-isk.

10:39.999 --> 10:42.828
[clears throat] You done?

10:42.829 --> 10:44.058
Almost. But I gotta ask...

10:44.059 --> 10:46.039
- [man] Where's the frickin' money?
- What?

10:49.039 --> 10:51.048
- Run! [grunts]
- What...

10:51.049 --> 10:53.878
- Son of a...

Look...

10:57.979 --> 10:59.958
Shut up!

10:59.959 --> 11:01.998
The rest of you, mount up.

11:01.999 --> 11:04.038
Sandy Trunkin.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.968
Trunkin Hines. Archie Trunker.

11:06.969 --> 11:09.928
- Ooh, Archie Trunker's Place.

11:09.929 --> 11:11.838

Yeah? Be a shame to

Ugh! I would, Alan.

We actually have a child together, so...

14:45.972 --> 14:48.811
Ew... Oh, I meant, aww.

14:48.812 --> 14:50.911
So, I would love it if you would shut up

14:50.912 --> 14:53.801

- Oh, whatever.

15:04.962 --> 15:06.386

15:06.411 --> 15:07.861
screw up a simple handoff?

15:07.862 --> 15:09.861
Wha... He didn't bring the money.

15:09.862 --> 15:11.821
Senator Stay Puft, rebuttal?

15:11.822 --> 15:13.941
I didn't bring it, because...

15:13.942 --> 15:15.981
[sighs] because I don't have it.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.021
- Wha... Well, who does?
- I don't know. Wall Street?

15:19.022 --> 15:21.901
Creditors? The three
different mortgage companies?

15:21.902 --> 15:23.861
Whoever thought it
was a good idea to start

15:23.862 --> 15:26.021
a faux hillbilly
restaurant chain called "Po' People"?

15:26.022 --> 15:27.460
Which was me, actually. I've given

15:27.485 --> 15:29.021
her some terrible investment advice.

15:29.022 --> 15:31.021
Wait. Did you mean "Po' Folks"?

15:31.022 --> 15:33.011
No. Those guys sued our dicks off.

15:33.012 --> 15:35.881
Wait. So, Veronica Deane is broke?

15:35.882 --> 15:37.791
No. She's...

15:37.792 --> 15:38.991
Oh, my God. Is that what this is?

15:38.992 --> 15:41.911
You're just intrigued by
the idea of a sugar mama?

15:41.912 --> 15:44.801
- No, not at all.
- Wait. What?

15:44.802 --> 15:45.951
- What?
- She's not broke.

15:45.952 --> 15:47.841
But she doesn't have two
million bucks for blackmail,

15:47.842 --> 15:48.991
so I figured I'd just bluff it,

15:48.992 --> 15:51.001
and then you guys would take 'em down.

15:51.002 --> 15:53.222

- Come on.

16:06.912 --> 16:09.871

- Ow!

16:15.972 --> 16:18.423
Sorry, but we got duped. We thought we

16:18.448 --> 16:20.811
were stealing the disk for Veronica.

16:20.812 --> 16:21.981
Oh, now you're on a first-name basis.

thing? Why can't I dial out?

16:31.002 --> 16:33.881

wait. Hang on. Stop.

16:56.952 --> 16:59.791

Well, I won't proceed without pants,

17:03.496 --> 17:05.021
Lana, and I can't wear his pants.

17:05.021 --> 17:07.931
Yeah. Plus, he's all dirty and bloody.

17:07.932 --> 17:09.851
And it's not like yours won't fit me.

17:09.852 --> 17:10.951

- But, man, emotionally?

17:46.962 --> 17:48.991
It's been a long time
since I killed anybody.

17:48.992 --> 17:50.396
You killed some of the bikers?

17:50.421 --> 17:51.941
They tried to wood-chipper me!

17:51.942 --> 17:53.941
- No. I meant...
- Although to be fair,

17:53.942 --> 17:55.941
if you open what you
think is an empty trunk,

17:55.942 --> 17:57.363
and suddenly there's a guy in

17:57.388 --> 17:58.981
there, you're gonna overreact.

17:58.982 --> 18:00.962
Kind of like that
time I walked into that

18:00.987 --> 18:02.941
motel room, and it was full of seagulls.

18:02.942 --> 18:04.881
- Archer.
- [chuckling] God.

18:04.882 --> 18:06.941
- Myrtle Beach is a train wreck.
- Archer!

18:06.942 --> 18:08.624
I don't know, Lana. I may have.

18:08.649 --> 18:09.981
I was in rampage mode.

18:09.982 --> 18:12.941
I definitely knocked
out, like, seven or eight, so...

18:12.942 --> 18:15.021
- Goddamn!
- Yeah. Pretty beat.

18:15.022 --> 18:16.543
So, is there any liquor back here?

18:16.568 --> 18:18.021
Like, even cooking sherry, or...

18:18.022 --> 18:19.932
My point is, there's probably only

18:19.957 --> 18:21.951
two or three bikers left out there.

18:21.952 --> 18:23.877
So go beat 'em up. Get the keys, get

18:23.902 --> 18:25.801
the disk, and let's get outta here.

18:25.802 --> 18:26.961
- [door opens]
- [man] Already?

18:26.962 --> 18:30.871
Don't you even wanna know who
hired us for the handoff?

18:30.872 --> 18:32.891
It was you!

18:32.892 --> 18:35.951
You had the fake Veronica
Deane hire us to steal that disk!

18:35.952 --> 18:37.991
What? Get... [grunting]

18:37.992 --> 18:40.851
Ow! No, it wasn't me.

18:40.852 --> 18:42.687
I'd never do that to Veronica.

18:42.712 --> 18:44.791
If that disk gets out, she'll be ruined.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.841
And I'm... And I'm in love with her.

18:47.842 --> 18:49.001
[sighs] Of course you are.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.871
Oh, don't be jealous, baby.

18:50.872 --> 18:52.951
You and I will always have what we had.

18:52.952 --> 18:55.931
- Wait. What? What?
- Uh, so, who did hire you?

18:55.932 --> 18:58.001
That's for me to
know and you to find out.

18:58.002 --> 18:59.755
Well, and for us to find out,

18:59.780 --> 19:01.931
too, since we don't know, either.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.881
Or why I said that out loud.

19:03.882 --> 19:05.953
What we do know is that our cut

19:05.978 --> 19:07.891
of two mil is ten percent.

19:07.892 --> 19:10.059
So, unless
somebody's got two hundred grand

19:10.084 --> 19:11.931
burning a hole in their pocket, I...

19:11.932 --> 19:13.596
I have a cashier's check for that exact

19:13.621 --> 19:15.011
amount, literally, in my pocket.

19:15.012 --> 19:17.339
It was to pay these private dicks.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.801
But if their actions

19:18.802 --> 19:20.801
don't constitute breach
of contract, then...

19:20.802 --> 19:22.821
Well, I'll just go ahead and take that.

19:22.822 --> 19:24.011
- [mechanical whining]
- [guns cocking]

19:24.012 --> 19:26.812
I already got dibs.

19:27.842 --> 19:29.841
And why the hell are you naked?

19:29.842 --> 19:33.801
It's after Labor Day.

19:33.802 --> 19:34.961
You ain't gonna get away with this.

19:34.962 --> 19:37.841
I'm gonna hunt you down, like... Ow!

19:37.842 --> 19:39.921
Tell it to the cops, shit-bird.

19:39.922 --> 19:41.402
Although obviously never speak to the

19:41.421 --> 19:42.831
police without an attorney present.

19:42.832 --> 19:44.831
[sighs] Thanks for coming, you guys.

19:44.832 --> 19:46.851
- Oh, my tits, whaaat!
- No.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.971
- We're back to saying "phrasing."
- [scoffs] I'm not.

19:48.972 --> 19:51.851
Well, apparently we're
not saying "thank you."

19:51.852 --> 19:53.941
Thank you, Mother, for arriving.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.851
Wait. So, could Ray not be bothered?

19:55.852 --> 19:58.022
He's outside, securing the perimeter.

20:01.932 --> 20:03.831
Say I won't.

20:03.832 --> 20:05.901
Good work, Ray. Thanks for coming.

20:05.902 --> 20:07.021
Oh, my tits, whaaat!

20:07.022 --> 20:08.891
What are you wearing?

20:08.892 --> 20:10.021
[chuckling] What are you wearing?

20:10.022 --> 20:11.891
Thought I might have to go undercover.

20:11.892 --> 20:14.011
- As what?
- A biker, dum-dum.

20:14.012 --> 20:17.811
[chuckling] It's
just you look kind of gay.

20:17.812 --> 20:19.981
- I look gay.
- A little bit. Yeah.

20:19.982 --> 20:22.871
Well, did you see Lana? Hey,
Earl Campbell called.

20:22.872 --> 20:24.792
He wants his thighs back.

20:29.989 --> 20:33.260
[Cyril] Okay, so,
first case... pros and cons.

20:33.261 --> 20:35.254
Well, we got tricked into blackmailing

20:35.279 --> 20:37.350
Veronica Deane, beloved Hollywood icon.

20:37.351 --> 20:39.420
- Yeah, that's definitely a con.
- But then we...

20:39.421 --> 20:43.220
Well, I totally kicked
ass and got the disk back.

20:43.221 --> 20:44.360
I will begrudge you a pro.

20:44.361 --> 20:47.220
Although I didn't get to
give it to her in person.

20:47.221 --> 20:49.240
- Maybe over cocktails.
- Pro.

20:49.241 --> 20:50.761
Also, we never found out what's on it

20:50.786 --> 20:52.320
or what "Longwater" even means, so...

20:52.321 --> 20:54.260
Because it's none of our business!

20:54.261 --> 20:56.300
Oh, and speaking of business,

20:56.301 --> 20:57.781
Shapiro said he'd recommend us to any

20:57.797 --> 20:59.360
of his clients that might need PI work.

20:59.361 --> 21:02.240
Ooh, the case of the missing kishke.

21:02.241 --> 21:04.360
Oh, and I also got stabbed.

21:04.361 --> 21:06.390
How is that a pro, you dick?

21:06.391 --> 21:08.280
Learning experience?

21:08.281 --> 21:10.370
Well, joke's on you. I
didn't learn anything.

21:10.371 --> 21:12.270
There's your fridge magnet.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.410
So, all in all, I'd
say our first case was

21:14.411 --> 21:16.370
a bit of a mixed bag.

21:16.371 --> 21:18.250
Oh, I don't know.

21:18.251 --> 21:20.370
Two hundred thousand
dollars for two days' work?

21:20.371 --> 21:22.390
That's not too shabby, people.

21:22.391 --> 21:24.440
Two hundred thousand divided

21:24.465 --> 21:26.270
by eight equal shares.

21:26.271 --> 21:29.270
That's... Holy shit-snacks!
25 grand each?

21:29.271 --> 21:31.200
Wait. What do you mean, "equal shares"?

21:31.201 --> 21:33.210
What do you think
this is, a pirate ship?

21:33.211 --> 21:36.280
Well, there's an easy way to find out.

21:36.281 --> 21:38.196
Like, I assume there's some sort

21:38.221 --> 21:40.290
of leather-bound ship's registry

21:40.291 --> 21:43.240
in the office of the Lord High Admiral.

21:43.241 --> 21:46.360
Ugh! Fine! I'll find it myself.

21:46.361 --> 21:47.625
Idiots!
