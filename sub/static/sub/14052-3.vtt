WEBVTT

00:31.560 --> 00:33.680
This is what I call overtime.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.320
We're on duty, remember?

00:35.360 --> 00:38.040
Fidel, we're baby-sitting a painting.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.920
Dwayne, it's a work of art.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.000
No. That is a work of art.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.520
Anything to report, Sergeant Best?

00:49.560 --> 00:51.760
-Commissioner. -All good, sir.

00:51.800 --> 00:55.960
Dwayne, Fidel, this is Leo Pascal, the owner

00:51.800 --> 00:55.960
of the Pascal Gallery.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.520
Leo, your security for this evening.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.600
I can't tell you how reassured I am to have

00:58.560 --> 01:01.600
you gentlemen here.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.280
You have a fine gallery.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.240
We was just enjoying the show.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.680
You're a fan of Durosseau?

01:09.680 --> 01:11.440
I prefer his older stuff.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.160
This may be your last chance to see his masterpiece.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.920
After the auction it'll probably go

01:14.200 --> 01:16.920
to a private collector...

01:16.960 --> 01:20.600
Oh, speaking of which. Excuse me.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.480
Uh-oh, Dragon Lady at two o'clock.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.240
-Good luck, sir. -Commissioner.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.120
Judge Stone.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.520
You look...

01:40.560 --> 01:41.600
Radiant.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.840
Selwyn. You look...

01:46.000 --> 01:47.480
Doughy.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.760
LEO: Her name was Cora Patrick.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.680
She was a dancer at the Mermaid Bar.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.760
Durosseau painted her portrait in an attempt to woo her.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.680
Was he successful?

02:01.720 --> 02:04.400
She rejected him because he was too poor.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.280
So, he killed himself.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.760
It's tragic, really.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.320
When did he paint it?

02:09.360 --> 02:12.880
Early last century. 1927 to be precise.

02:14.120 --> 02:19.560
Excuse me. Dorothy, I'm so glad you came.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.800
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.040
Oh, you've met Carlton, haven't you?

02:24.080 --> 02:26.000
-Good to see you again. -And you.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.160
So, I can't wait to see the painting.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.240
It's right over here.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.960
DOROTHY: Oh, you know, Carlton's been trying

02:30.280 --> 02:33.960
to teach me about art

02:34.000 --> 02:35.200
but it's hopeless.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.240
I am such a philistine, you see?

02:37.280 --> 02:41.080
LEO: I'm sure that's not true. You've always had

02:37.280 --> 02:41.080
excellent taste...

02:41.840 --> 02:43.560
Friend of yours?

02:43.600 --> 02:45.440
Yeah, a long time ago.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.240
Ah. The glamour has arrived.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.280
Let me get you some champagne.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.440
Sergeant Best, arrest me now.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.520
Why, sir?

03:07.560 --> 03:09.600
Anything to get away from that woman.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.800
I don't know what the fuss is about, so what if it

03:09.640 --> 03:13.800
leaves the island?

03:13.840 --> 03:16.440
Oh, Carlton thinks it should stay here.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.520
Durosseau's our most famous artist.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.720
Oh, excuse me. Carlton!

03:27.440 --> 03:28.640
Carlton, wait!

03:29.960 --> 03:31.920
Where are you going?

03:31.960 --> 03:33.560
I really need to take this.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.960
Quarter of a million dollars?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.640
Yes, it's a lot for a painting.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.840
Hmm.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.120
Diverted call from the station.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.240
Hello.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.960
MAN: <i> Hello? Police.</i>

03:53.000 --> 03:56.280
<i>My name is Carlton Paris.</i> <i>I'm at 125 Shore Road.</i>

03:56.320 --> 03:57.800
<i>She's got a gun...</i>

03:57.840 --> 03:59.720
Hello

04:02.240 --> 04:04.560
Hey

04:13.840 --> 04:15.440
FIDEL: Honore Police!

04:15.480 --> 04:16.800
Open up, Carlton!

05:26.280 --> 05:28.360
Can you please charge your phone?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.600
I did. Soon as I got in.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.640
Look.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.120
Electricity helps.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.200
Sorry. I got a little sidetracked.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.760
-Yes. We have a murder.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.200
Ah, great, I'll just get my, er...

05:41.520 --> 05:42.560
Yes, great.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.840
CAMILLE: What have we got? DWAYNE: Local boy.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.840
Carlton Paris.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.080
Shot.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.760
CAMILLE: Who found him? DWAYNE: We did.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.720
The Pascal Gallery job the Commissioner hired us for.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.120
Carlton was a guest.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.960
He left early, but an hour and a half later,

06:01.000 --> 06:05.280
he called the station, gave his name and address,

06:01.000 --> 06:05.280
and said...

06:05.320 --> 06:06.520
"She's got a gun."

06:06.560 --> 06:08.480
Did he by any chance say who she was?

06:08.520 --> 06:10.960
No, that would be far too easy, wouldn't it?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.840
So what do we know about the victim?

06:12.880 --> 06:14.240
I think you better ask Fidel.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.800
Why Fidel?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.120
Seems they knew each other.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.240
Ah.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.760
Looks like he took a shot to the shoulder

06:28.280 --> 06:29.760
and to the back.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.520
Close range. Killer probably fired from the doorway.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.960
When did you get the call? 8:30.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.240
CAMILLE: And you arrived at? FIDEL: 8:35.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.640
A five-minute window for the killer to shoot him

06:39.280 --> 06:42.640
and then get away.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.600
We did a brief search of the grounds

06:42.680 --> 06:44.600
and surrounding areas

06:44.640 --> 06:46.120
but there was no sign of anyone.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.520
Also, the door was intact when we got here

06:53.560 --> 06:55.280
so he must have let the killer in.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.920
Which suggests he knew her.

06:58.840 --> 06:59.920
Yes, Camille.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.240
What are you doing?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.360
His glasses. They're for reading.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.040
So?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.720
So, what was he reading?

07:18.400 --> 07:19.760
Dwayne says you were friends.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.400
We were at the same school.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.840
But were you close?

07:24.880 --> 07:26.040
HUMPHREY: Very, I'd say...

07:26.680 --> 07:27.920
How do you know?

07:27.960 --> 07:29.880
Why else would Fidel be so upset?

07:30.520 --> 07:32.200
I'm not upset.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.840
Really

07:33.880 --> 07:35.560
Because it's not like you to miss such a big clue.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.440
I can only assume it's because you're upset.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.840
What clue?

07:38.880 --> 07:40.000
There's no landline here.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.560
So?

07:41.600 --> 07:44.680
So, he must have made a call on his mobile

07:41.600 --> 07:44.680
to the station.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.560
Did you find it?

07:50.280 --> 07:51.320
Which means?

07:51.360 --> 07:52.760
-The killer took it. -Exactly.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.320
Wow!

08:01.320 --> 08:03.360
Wow! Look at the size of that.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.200
It's bigger than a king

08:05.160 --> 08:08.200
Emperor

08:08.240 --> 08:09.400
Tsar

08:11.320 --> 08:13.240
Ah!

08:13.280 --> 08:16.360
Oh, it's comfy too. Gives a lot back.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.920
Designer suits.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.000
Mmm-hmm.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.480
What did he do?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.640
As far as we know, he was unemployed.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.520
Rich partner then?

08:29.560 --> 08:31.400
No partner. No family.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.640
Then how could he afford all this?

08:36.680 --> 08:38.920
Good question. Come.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.360
So, we checked in here.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.680
We ruled out burglary because they left the laptop.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.960
They took his mobile.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.920
Look, his diary.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.080
Seems like a woman for every week.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.480
Imagine...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.400
Today is marked Dorothy Foster.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.760
-Mmm-hmm.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.640
Carlton was with her at the gallery this evening.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.200
They looked very cosy.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.800
CAMILLE: Isn't she a little old for him?

09:07.640 --> 09:09.480
These are all rich women.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.920
DWAYNE: Mmm-hmm.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.320
Odd selection of books, don't you think?

09:13.360 --> 09:16.240
All reference and no fiction.

09:16.280 --> 09:21.560
And the subjects. Antiques, opera, art,

09:16.280 --> 09:21.560
food, travel, gardening.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.520
Not what you'd expect a man in his 20s to be reading.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.040
As far as I can see he wasn't so much reading them

09:27.360 --> 09:31.040
as mining them.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.760
Mining them for what?

09:33.800 --> 09:36.200
Conversation, I think. Take a look.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.440
You see?

09:39.480 --> 09:42.760
He's marked this section on Royal Doulton

09:39.480 --> 09:42.760
as "Ice Breaker".

09:42.800 --> 09:46.600
Then there's the fancy sculptures.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.400
Expensive, tasteful, but with a touch of femininity

09:46.640 --> 09:50.400
about them.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.800
Not his choice. I think these were gifts.

09:52.840 --> 09:57.320
So, we have a 25-year-old man with no apparent income

09:57.360 --> 10:01.600
living in a prime beachside property with a wardrobe

09:57.360 --> 10:01.600
full of designer suits.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.800
He studies culture for conversation and receives

10:01.640 --> 10:05.800
gifts from rich women.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.280
And, according to that,

10:08.320 --> 10:11.040
he clearly had a punishing romantic schedule.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.320
Feels like I'm missing something.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.400
Did you know

10:22.800 --> 10:24.320
That Carlton was a gigolo?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.160
He had a way with women.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.640
Looks like he had a way with half the women

10:28.200 --> 10:30.640
on the island.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.280
Yeah, well, that's nothing to be proud of.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.520
How long since you were close?

10:40.400 --> 10:41.520
A few years.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.480
What happened?

10:44.520 --> 10:45.560
We grew apart.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.400
I'm going to need a copy of <i>Walks of the Caribbean</i>

10:53.200 --> 10:57.400
by Albert Dunn.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.680
What?

10:59.720 --> 11:01.040
<i>Volume II</i> by the looks of it.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.440
Why would you need that?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.720
Carlton was reading, but no written material

11:04.480 --> 11:07.720
was found in the front room.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.040
Books are in alphabetical order.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.520
All seem to be accounted for apart from...

11:13.560 --> 11:17.080
See? <i>Volume I</i> and <i> Volume III.</i>

11:17.120 --> 11:20.120
Maybe our killer took <i> Volume II.</i>

11:20.160 --> 11:22.280
All for a mobile phone and an old book?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.560
I don't know.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.160
The things people kill for nowadays, eh?

11:29.840 --> 11:31.760
HUMPHREY: How far was the gallery from here?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.360
Less than a mile.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.840
So, despite there being two police officers

11:33.400 --> 11:35.840
within five minutes,

11:35.880 --> 11:37.440
Carlton chose to call the station.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.840
He panicked. Dialled 999 and got through the switchboard.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.560
But him and Fidel were old friends.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.560
Why not call him?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.400
Apparently, they grew apart.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.880
It's odd though, don't you think?

11:46.920 --> 11:49.960
Not as odd as Fidel being friends

11:46.920 --> 11:49.960
with the island gigolo.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Yes, you've got a point there.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.240
Wait a minute. Did you say "gigolo"?

12:02.800 --> 12:04.040
HUMPHREY: <i> The problem</i> <i>with being single</i>

12:04.080 --> 12:06.400
<i>is finding ways</i> <i>to occupy your time.</i>

12:06.440 --> 12:09.000
Then there's the discipline of cooking a proper dinner,

12:09.040 --> 12:12.440
not simply resorting to baked beans on toast every night.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.440
Making the bed. And they're all daily battles,

12:12.480 --> 12:15.440
don't you find?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.240
Yes, but I make my own bed every morning

12:20.280 --> 12:23.280
and I have no idea what baked beans are.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.280
FIDEL: I need that information now.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.800
No, look, tomorrow is no good.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.720
Yes! He's chasing Carlton's service provider.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.840
FIDEL: Okay! But you do understand this

12:30.760 --> 12:32.840
is a murder investigation?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.360
You should have been here for the forensics call.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.600
FIDEL: I want them here by tomorrow.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.360
First they can't track his phone

12:47.400 --> 12:49.240
then it's a two-day wait for his call records.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.240
They're amateurs.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.240
Let's skip coffee.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.000
Right, Carlton Paris, a 25-year-old male escort

12:59.280 --> 13:03.000
attends a viewing

13:03.040 --> 13:06.440
at the Pascal Gallery, leaves early and

13:03.040 --> 13:06.440
an hour and a half later...

13:06.480 --> 13:08.720
Is threatened with a gun by a woman.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.040
First question is why?

13:18.680 --> 13:20.360
His job. He was a gigolo.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
Maybe it was a disgruntled client.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.120
Where are we on his clientele?

13:24.160 --> 13:26.720
Most of his customers were businesswomen or tourists.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.000
But he did have a few regulars on the island.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.720
Yes, including Dorothy Foster.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.000
She's hired Carlton every Saturday

13:30.760 --> 13:33.000
for the past eight months.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.640
Must have cost her a fortune.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.560
Carlton arrived at the viewing with Dorothy around 6:30.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.240
But he left her sometime around 7:00.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.320
Any idea why?

13:40.360 --> 13:41.880
No. But she didn't look very happy.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.520
Right.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.520
Dwayne, let's track down these local clients,

13:45.560 --> 13:47.640
see if they have an alibi for the time of death.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.880
-Yes, Chief. -20:30 to 20:35.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.120
That is our golden hour.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.800
Or golden five minutes, to be precise.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.200
-Ballistics. -They said we'd have

13:56.840 --> 13:59.200
something this morning.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.040
Also, we could do a profile of Carlton.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.040
As you were friends.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.880
I hadn't spoken to him in years.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.600
People don't change that much.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.800
Chief?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.720
<i>Walks of the Caribbean</i> by Albert Dunn.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.360
<i>Volume II.</i> Happy reading.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.080
Wow. This looks, er, heavy. -Keep an eye on Fidel.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.800
-Hmm.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.080
Okay, in the meantime, let's go and see what

14:27.840 --> 14:31.080
Dorothy Foster has to say.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.840
So this is the Reef Club?

14:44.880 --> 14:46.400
Where the rich come to play.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.520
I'm sorry.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.520
I met Carlton about a year ago. In this room.

15:00.560 --> 15:05.920
It was the Valentine's Dance and we got chatting.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.280
He was handsome and charming. Attentive.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.120
So you began hiring him?

15:12.040 --> 15:15.000
He became my Saturday-night date.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.160
It wasn't a physical arrangement, you understand.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.120
More like best friends. We had so much in common.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.760
Like art?

15:28.400 --> 15:33.160
Carlton loved art. It inspired him.

15:33.200 --> 15:37.800
He always said that art was truth.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.520
If he loved art so much, why did he leave the viewing

15:37.840 --> 15:41.520
early last night?

15:42.600 --> 15:45.240
Well, that's what I was wondering.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.600
Did you have an argument?

15:46.640 --> 15:49.320
No, one moment everything was fine

15:49.360 --> 15:51.920
and then the next Carlton was leaving.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.880
Carlton, wait...

15:53.920 --> 15:55.800
<i>So I followed him out and...</i>

15:55.840 --> 15:57.120
Where are you going?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.440
He never came back.

16:05.880 --> 16:06.960
What time was this?

16:07.000 --> 16:10.040
Um, around 7:00 p.m.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.560
Did you try to call him later?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.440
Dorothy?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.840
I've been looking all over for you.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.280
Oh, it's...

16:18.320 --> 16:20.560
Just awful. Poor Carlton.

16:22.040 --> 16:26.080
Leo Pascal. I own Pascal Gallery.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.440
So, you were at the viewing?

16:27.480 --> 16:29.120
Of course.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.880
We were just wondering why Carlton left the gallery

16:29.160 --> 16:31.880
so abruptly.

16:31.920 --> 16:35.920
I think he might have had some kind of run-in

16:31.920 --> 16:35.920
with Marc Campese.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.240
Marc Campese?

16:37.280 --> 16:40.440
He owns the Reef Club.

16:40.480 --> 16:46.160
LEO: <i> Carlton and I were</i> <i>discussing the Durosseau</i>

16:40.480 --> 16:46.160
<i>when Campese turned up.</i>

16:46.200 --> 16:50.960
<i>I didn't catch what he said,</i> <i>but it made quite an impact</i>

16:46.200 --> 16:50.960
<i>on Carlton.</i>

16:53.560 --> 16:55.200
And you've no idea what it was about?

16:56.040 --> 16:57.960
Sorry. Haven't the foggiest.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.920
Where were you between 8:30 and 8:35 yesterday?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.280
I was at home.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.880
Were you alone?

17:11.880 --> 17:13.840
I'm nearly always alone.

17:19.840 --> 17:21.400
-Ooh, I'm sorry.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.840
You know, I think the Inspector meant

17:40.560 --> 17:42.840
he wanted you

17:42.880 --> 17:45.480
to interview the suspects, not date them.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.000
You can come with me if you want, make sure

17:45.520 --> 17:49.000
I behave.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.600
Haven't finished Carlton's profile.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.400
Looks like you haven't started it.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.520
"Carlton Paris, 25.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.880
"Dead."

18:02.480 --> 18:03.760
You sure you two were friends?

18:08.640 --> 18:11.520
What happened between you two?

18:11.560 --> 18:13.640
-It's okay, man. You can tell me.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.640
-We fell out.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.440
Was it a girl? Did he steal her from you

18:16.480 --> 18:18.600
or vice versa?

18:20.560 --> 18:21.600
Hey, where you going?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.040
Fidel!

18:26.400 --> 18:28.000
I almost feel sorry for her. Why?

18:30.040 --> 18:31.880
She seems grief-stricken.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.080
Could be remorse.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.920
You really think she's capable of murder?

18:36.960 --> 18:40.240
She's the last person to see him alive

18:36.960 --> 18:40.240
and her alibi is weak.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.360
Did she just...

18:48.960 --> 18:50.560
I think she did.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.720
Why would she do that?

18:54.760 --> 18:57.480
Maybe she has a twitch. Or sunstroke.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.760
So, Carlton's argument with Marc Campese,

18:59.480 --> 19:02.760
we should check it out.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.800
We should, but isn't he the wrong sex

19:02.800 --> 19:05.800
to be a suspect?

19:05.840 --> 19:08.560
Maybe. But his wife isn't.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.440
So, I spoke to Carlton. Big deal.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.360
What was the conversation about?

19:19.400 --> 19:23.160
Er, just, er, you know, small talk.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.960
We understand that this small talk upset Carlton

19:23.200 --> 19:27.960
and made him leave early.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.320
Rubbish.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.840
Look, we exchanged a few words, yes,

19:31.880 --> 19:35.960
but, er, it was so trivial, I have no recollection

19:31.880 --> 19:35.960
what they were.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.240
Did you know Carlton well?

19:37.280 --> 19:39.880
I knew what he was, that was enough.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.760
And what was that?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.960
A man who preyed on the lonely.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.600
Look, don't get me wrong, he was good at it,

19:49.640 --> 19:51.240
but it's hardly an honourable way to make a living.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.880
What about you, Mrs Campese?

19:55.040 --> 19:57.320
Er, what about me?

19:57.360 --> 19:58.880
Did you know Carlton well?

19:59.440 --> 20:01.080
Er, not really.

20:01.120 --> 20:05.320
Er, he was a member of the club,

20:01.120 --> 20:05.320
but we very rarely spoke.

20:07.160 --> 20:12.000
Did Carlton ever bring any of his, er, clients

20:07.160 --> 20:12.000
to the Reef Club?

20:12.040 --> 20:14.680
He did... Until I put a stop to it.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.600
Why did you do that?

20:16.640 --> 20:19.920
Preying on our female members, it's bad for business.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.880
Okay, afraid we have another meeting.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.080
Is there anything else?

20:25.120 --> 20:26.120
Uh...

20:28.800 --> 20:33.000
Where were you between 8:30 and 8:35?

20:33.040 --> 20:37.080
Let me see, well, we left the gallery at about 8:00.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.400
Home by 8:30.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.880
Early night.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.880
Yes. We were both very tired.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.440
CAMILLE: Marc Campese was lying.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.280
HUMPHREY: But Marc Campese's not a she.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.440
-Doesn't mean he's not involved.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.440
-Hmm.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.120
And his wife's lying too.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.120
Anything useful?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.680
What?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.680
The book.

21:04.720 --> 21:08.200
It's just an out-of-date travel guide with a few

21:04.720 --> 21:08.200
chapters on Saint Marie.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.400
"The pretty island of Saint Marie is situated

21:10.440 --> 21:12.480
"in the eastern Caribbean Sea."

21:12.520 --> 21:16.080
"It is one tenth the size of its northwest

21:12.520 --> 21:16.080
neighbour, Guadeloupe,

21:16.120 --> 21:17.520
"one eighth of the size of Dominica,

21:17.560 --> 21:19.480
"one sixth of the size of Saint Lucia,

21:19.520 --> 21:21.760
"One fifth the size of Martinique

21:21.800 --> 21:23.680
"and a third of the size of Barbados..."

21:23.720 --> 21:27.800
And on and on and on it goes.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.480
Why would our killer want to take this

21:27.840 --> 21:30.480
from Carlton's villa?

21:30.520 --> 21:32.160
Must be something important in it.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.040
Er, it's Dwayne.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.200
Any luck on Carlton's clients?

21:38.240 --> 21:40.320
DWAYNE: <i> Seems Carlton</i> <i>had another client.</i>

21:40.360 --> 21:42.120
And you'll never believe who it is.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.200
Who?

21:43.240 --> 21:45.040
DWAYNE: <i> Judge Anne Stone.</i>

21:45.720 --> 21:46.840
Ah.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.320
Judge Anne Stone?

21:49.800 --> 21:52.520
Who's Judge Anne Stone?

21:52.560 --> 21:57.040
There was no relationship between Carlton Paris and I.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.040
Right. Er, I see.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.800
Well, we're just... We're pretty sure

21:59.080 --> 22:02.800
that you hired him.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.560
CAMILLE: We checked his bank records.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.240
You made a single payment to him last month.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.520
Hmm. My God. You must be desperate.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.280
We're just covering every angle.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.960
Fine.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.560
Last month I had to attend the Law Society dinner.

22:20.600 --> 22:26.600
Now, it is still considered bad form for a woman

22:20.600 --> 22:26.600
to attend unaccompanied.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.280
You needed a date?

22:28.320 --> 22:31.440
My PA, she used her initiative.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.200
And hired Carlton?

22:33.240 --> 22:35.560
She told me Carlton was a friend.

22:35.600 --> 22:40.160
It was only later that I found out he was,

22:35.600 --> 22:40.160
in fact, an escort.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.760
So, what happened?

22:42.800 --> 22:44.280
I sacked her, of course.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.720
I mean, with Carlton.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.000
A little too clingy for my liking.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.160
So you never hired him again?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.680
Are you mad?

22:52.720 --> 22:55.200
Do you have any idea what associating

22:55.240 --> 22:59.080
with a male escort would do to my reputation?

23:01.520 --> 23:03.000
Now, is there anything else?

23:04.360 --> 23:05.800
Yes.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.240
Where were you between 8:30 and 8:35 yesterday evening?

23:09.280 --> 23:10.960
In my chambers.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.120
Anyone see you there?

23:12.840 --> 23:14.320
I have no idea.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.160
Wow.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.120
-STONE: Hello. -She reminds me of my mum.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.680
STONE: Yes, it is.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.560
-That explains a lot. -STONE: Just do it!

24:26.200 --> 24:29.880
"The waters around Saint Marie are too treacherous for any

24:26.200 --> 24:29.880
larger vessels to chance. "However this may soon change

24:29.920 --> 24:33.600
as a lighthouse is currently being erected.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.400
"Rainforests that hum with life.

24:39.440 --> 24:45.640
"The wonderful indigenous birdlife includes the fabled

24:39.440 --> 24:45.640
Saint Marie green..."

24:47.600 --> 24:49.960
Maybe he was reading this and shot himself.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.800
Wow, can't believe they closed it down.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.160
It was hardly a surprise, stuck out here.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.320
No one could ever find the place.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.400
So, what's so important?

25:30.480 --> 25:31.600
Lauren...

25:33.720 --> 25:35.360
I found this at Carlton's villa.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.640
It's yours, isn't it?

25:43.560 --> 25:45.160
What do you want me to say?

25:45.200 --> 25:47.160
What was it doing under his pillow?

25:48.360 --> 25:50.080
Oh, work it out, Fidel.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.160
So, how long had you been...

25:55.200 --> 25:56.960
-Yeah.

25:57.720 --> 25:58.920
A year.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.000
You should leave him.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.000
You know, I'd planned to.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.880
Carlton and I were off to America.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.160
He bought tickets.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.400
There's no chance of that happening now.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.280
No.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.480
Lauren?

26:23.640 --> 26:25.160
-Er...

26:26.520 --> 26:30.040
You know... I, erm... I really should get going.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.200
Lauren? Lauren!

26:34.280 --> 26:35.480
Did he know?

26:42.840 --> 26:45.680
Marc Campese found out that Lauren and Carlton

26:42.840 --> 26:45.680
were having an affair.

26:45.720 --> 26:46.840
How did he find out?

26:46.880 --> 26:48.400
Somebody at the club told him.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.200
And how did he react?

26:50.240 --> 26:53.120
Marc has a temper at the best of times.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.960
At the gallery the night that Carlton was killed,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.720
Marc threatened him, told him to stay away from me.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.160
-So much for the small talk. -Mmm.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.840
Do you think he would've carried out his threat?

27:06.600 --> 27:08.680
It's okay. You can tell them.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.560
Marc lied when he said that we went home

27:11.080 --> 27:14.560
after the viewing.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.640
<i>After we left the gallery,</i> <i>he was still angry.</i>

27:19.680 --> 27:22.720
<i>We were arguing.</i> <i>Things got ugly</i>

27:19.680 --> 27:22.720
<i>when I told him</i>

27:22.760 --> 27:24.040
<i>that I was leaving him</i> <i>for Carlton.</i>

27:24.080 --> 27:25.600
<i>That was it.</i>

27:25.640 --> 27:26.880
<i>Red rag to a bull.</i>

27:27.640 --> 27:29.120
Marc!

27:29.160 --> 27:30.480
What time was this?

27:30.520 --> 27:34.120
Er, about 8:00. I went home and I waited for him.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.880
No, but I have a pretty good idea.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.000
-Mmm. -So do we.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.440
-Commissioner.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.880
I understand you paid a visit to Judge Stone yesterday.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.280
She's helping with our inquiries.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.480
Everything to your satisfaction?

28:01.520 --> 28:03.000
Routine interview, that's all.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.680
How disappointing.

28:05.720 --> 28:09.360
You know, I wonder if you shouldn't be too quick

28:05.720 --> 28:09.360
to dismiss the good judge

28:09.400 --> 28:10.880
from your investigation.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.960
Sir?

28:13.000 --> 28:17.080
Judge Stone is a prominent citizen with

28:13.000 --> 28:17.080
considerable political power.

28:17.120 --> 28:21.920
It's our civic duty to ensure there's nothing

28:17.120 --> 28:21.920
to compromise her.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.560
You're asking us to dig for dirt?

28:26.640 --> 28:28.040
Not at all.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.120
But should you uncover any skeletons,

28:31.320 --> 28:33.120
I'd like to know first.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.440
She made him spend a day in jail.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.520
You're kidding?

28:42.720 --> 28:43.800
What for?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.440
Parking fines.

28:45.480 --> 28:46.840
Can you jail someone for that?

28:46.880 --> 28:48.320
Judge Stone can.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.760
MARC: You two again.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.080
I've got nothing else to say to you.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.320
Well, we'd love to talk to you...

29:00.360 --> 29:02.280
About your movements after the viewing.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.280
Told you. I went home.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.200
You might want to rethink that answer.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.080
Lauren?

29:19.600 --> 29:20.640
Huh.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.800
What can I say?

29:23.840 --> 29:27.320
I thought my role as husband was to provide...

29:27.360 --> 29:29.560
Give my wife everything her heart desired.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.800
It turns out that what she desired was

29:31.200 --> 29:33.800
some jumped-up gigolo.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.720
Do you know they were actually planning to run away together?

29:37.760 --> 29:39.720
Must have made you very angry.

29:39.760 --> 29:44.240
Yeah, yeah, it did.

29:44.280 --> 29:48.880
<i>As soon as Lauren told me</i> <i>she was leaving,</i>

29:44.280 --> 29:48.880
<i>the rage took over me.</i>

29:48.920 --> 29:51.480
<i>Don't ask me what</i> <i>I was planning to do.</i>

29:51.520 --> 29:53.200
<i>I just wanted to get there.</i>

29:53.240 --> 29:54.280
And do what?

29:57.440 --> 29:58.840
And kill him, of course.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.640
Did you?

30:06.160 --> 30:08.320
No.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.840
<i>When I got to his villa,</i> <i>Dorothy was there.</i>

30:13.360 --> 30:14.960
Dorothy Foster? There she was,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.360
demanding that Carlton let her in.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.000
She was angry.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.440
What time was this?

30:22.480 --> 30:24.160
Around 8:15.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.520
So what did you do?

30:27.520 --> 30:31.400
Hung around for five minutes waiting for her to leave.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.400
Suppose I must've cooled off a bit.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.320
Anyway, I left.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.600
Then where did you go?

30:36.640 --> 30:37.920
I walked around for a while.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.400
Came to my senses, and went home.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.840
That's it

30:43.960 --> 30:46.480
What about the rage that came over you?

30:46.520 --> 30:48.600
I decided to redirect it.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.280
CAMILLE: Would you mind telling us where?

30:58.360 --> 31:00.520
I know what this looks like from the outside.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.520
Rich older man marries a pretty young woman.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.720
Trophy wife.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.040
The fact is, I love Lauren.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.040
I just have to find a way to prove that to her.

31:22.360 --> 31:23.680
You have to sign your statement.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.200
And then what?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.200
And then you can go.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.200
Er, I found this last night.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.000
FIDEL:  When was this taken?

31:41.040 --> 31:43.680
The day you got into police college.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.160
Carlton bought the cocktails.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.200
Oh, he was always the big spender.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.960
Yeah, we...

31:49.000 --> 31:50.480
-We look drunk. -But happy.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.800
Used to love spending time with the two of you.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.720
You were so close.

31:56.760 --> 31:57.960
Like brothers.

31:59.160 --> 32:02.160
Yeah... Until I spoilt it all.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.120
He still considered you a friend.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.880
Then why didn't he call me?

32:06.920 --> 32:08.520
He was in trouble. His life was in danger.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.600
He should've called me.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.560
Er, you can keep that.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.480
Thanks.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.480
Thank you for letting me see it.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.240
It's such a beautiful work.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.560
And the last memory I have of Carlton.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.240
Is everything set for the auction?

32:46.560 --> 32:48.880
We're expecting quite a turnout.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.520
Inspector Goodman.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.880
Miss Foster, we have a witness

32:54.560 --> 32:57.880
who says they saw you

32:57.920 --> 32:59.880
at Carlton's villa last night.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.920
Who also says you were very angry.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.840
Mr Pascal, could you give us a moment, please?

33:09.640 --> 33:10.720
Thank you.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.440
I've never had much luck with men.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.920
I always seem to attract the wrong sort.

33:20.960 --> 33:26.320
Daddy used to despair, "They're only after one thing,

33:20.960 --> 33:26.320
Dorothy, my money."

33:26.360 --> 33:31.160
So, after 10 years of moving from one disastrous

33:26.360 --> 33:31.160
relationship to the next,

33:32.120 --> 33:34.000
I decided enough was enough. You hired Carlton?

33:35.960 --> 33:38.760
At least with him, I didn't have to pretend

33:35.960 --> 33:38.760
it wasn't about my money.

33:40.240 --> 33:43.600
But the truth is, he made me feel like I was important.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.440
Why did you go to the villa?

33:49.280 --> 33:51.440
Well, when he didn't return to the gallery,

33:51.480 --> 33:53.280
I went to see if he was all right.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.160
Then what made you so angry?

33:56.200 --> 34:00.040
The night of the viewing, Carlton asked to see me early.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.000
Said he had an announcement.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.800
For one silly moment I thought that he was

34:03.040 --> 34:06.800
planning to propose, but...

34:08.560 --> 34:10.680
No.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.400
He said he was leaving the island

34:12.440 --> 34:15.640
and that this would be our last date together.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.360
Did he say why he was leaving?

34:19.720 --> 34:21.520
Apparently, he'd fallen in love.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.800
I tried to be happy for him.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.320
I put on quite an act.

34:27.360 --> 34:32.600
But then I realised that this would be

34:27.360 --> 34:32.600
my last time with him, so...

34:32.640 --> 34:35.160
Well, I just couldn't cope, so...

34:35.200 --> 34:38.760
I thought that if I offered him more money, or...

34:38.800 --> 34:40.840
Even if I bought him the Durosseau...

34:41.560 --> 34:43.000
What did Carlton say?

34:45.280 --> 34:48.720
He never even answered the door.

34:48.760 --> 34:52.160
Are you saying you went to bribe Carlton to stay

34:48.760 --> 34:52.160
friends with you?

34:53.080 --> 34:54.120
You don't believe me?

34:55.880 --> 34:58.720
I'm struggling to understand.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.600
Then you have never been lonely.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.920
CAMILLE: What do you think?

35:10.960 --> 35:14.320
HUMPHREY: I find it hard to believe that he wouldn't

35:10.960 --> 35:14.320
at least talk to her.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.400
She has motive and opportunity.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.120
All we're missing is the murder weapon.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.520
Excuse me... <i> Allo.</i>

35:27.200 --> 35:29.120
-Yes.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.280
Yes, she is.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.360
The artist was in love with her.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.640
Do you know about Durosseau and Cora?

35:36.680 --> 35:39.240
No. But I can see it in there.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.800
CAMILLE: Hmm... <i> D'accord.</i>

35:45.080 --> 35:46.360
<i>Oui.</i>

35:47.200 --> 35:48.760
<i>Je vous remercie.</i> Forensics are in.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.640
Sir? Sir!

35:54.680 --> 35:57.240
Sorry. Coming.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.880
DWAYNE: So, there's nothing in the pathology report to

36:04.000 --> 36:08.880
refute what we already know.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.640
The first bullet entered the left shoulder.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.600
It was the second bullet that did the damage,

36:12.640 --> 36:13.840
pierced the heart.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.280
-A .45-calibre.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.960
-Check the firearms register. -DWAYNE: Yes, Chief.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.640
What happened with Campese?

36:20.680 --> 36:23.960
He admitted going to the villa, but claims

36:20.680 --> 36:23.960
he never saw Carlton.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.840
And what, you believe that story?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.520
We've got nothing to contradict it.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.160
Honore Police.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.480
So if Dorothy Foster and Marc Campese

36:32.760 --> 36:36.480
were outside the villa

36:36.520 --> 36:40.520
before 8:30 and Judge Stone

36:36.520 --> 36:40.520
was in her chambers,

36:40.560 --> 36:42.680
that just leaves us with Lauren.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.320
Wait, hold on, Lauren's still a suspect?

36:44.360 --> 36:45.680
We can't confirm she was at home.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.720
Camille, she... She didn't kill Carlton.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.880
-Because I know her.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.280
Maybe she changed. Like you said,

36:49.920 --> 36:52.280
it's been a few years.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.720
Yeah, and like you said, people don't change

36:52.320 --> 36:54.720
that much, remember?

36:54.760 --> 36:55.800
DWAYNE: Thank you very much.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.600
That was Carlton's service provider.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.920
They're emailing phone statements,

36:59.640 --> 37:02.920
but one number called

37:02.960 --> 37:06.120
Carlton's phone every day for the past two weeks.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.560
So I ran a check.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.760
And whose is it?

37:08.800 --> 37:10.440
Judge Anne Stone.

37:18.160 --> 37:21.200
So, I called him a few times.

37:21.240 --> 37:25.520
It might be better if you just told us the truth,

37:21.240 --> 37:25.520
Your Honour.

37:25.560 --> 37:31.880
Do you have any clue what it's like to be a woman

37:25.560 --> 37:31.880
in this profession?

37:31.920 --> 37:35.120
You have to be in control all the time.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.760
Even more so than the men.

37:37.800 --> 37:42.040
Twenty years of my life I have dedicated to my career

37:42.080 --> 37:44.760
and you have to learn to be tough.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.800
You don't become the Dragon Lady overnight,

37:44.800 --> 37:48.800
let me tell you.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.200
And Carlton?

37:57.200 --> 38:03.840
He brought out a side in me I thought I had buried

37:57.200 --> 38:03.840
long ago.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.200
He reminded me I have a sense of humour.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.640
I'm actually very funny.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.000
Yeah, no, we can see that.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.760
I was intoxicated.

38:16.600 --> 38:19.240
I wasn't in love with him...

38:19.280 --> 38:24.280
It was more that I was in love with who I am

38:19.280 --> 38:24.280
when I was with him.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.120
And then he backed off.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.560
Then what did you do?

38:33.800 --> 38:35.400
I got desperate.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.680
I never left him alone.

38:42.360 --> 38:45.560
I called him... Night...

38:46.840 --> 38:47.840
And day.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.000
But it didn't work?

38:55.920 --> 38:57.840
Desperation never does.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.520
-HUMPHREY: I'm finding

38:59.800 --> 39:01.520
it hard to imagine

39:01.560 --> 39:02.640
Judge Stone as a killer.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.080
-CAMILLE: Oh!

39:04.120 --> 39:07.120
Easier than imagining her having a sense of humour?

39:07.160 --> 39:09.560
-Oh! Ugh, please!

39:09.600 --> 39:13.480
These women hired Carlton, he made them all happy. How?

39:13.520 --> 39:15.800
Most men struggle to make one woman happy.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.840
Clearly, he was good at his job.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.520
Yes, then there's the mobile. And the book and...

39:20.560 --> 39:22.960
It makes no sense, I read it from cover to cover.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.120
Excellent work, DI Goodman.

39:25.920 --> 39:29.120
So, where's the prisoner?

39:29.160 --> 39:30.400
Prisoner, sir?

39:30.440 --> 39:33.360
Why, Judge Stone, of course.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.160
Dwayne informs me you were about to arrest her.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.320
Huh?

39:36.360 --> 39:38.160
That's not what I said...

39:38.200 --> 39:39.280
Commissioner.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.480
-Well, actually,

39:43.520 --> 39:46.960
it was more of a follow-up interview with Judge Stone.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.640
A follow

39:49.680 --> 39:51.040
Some further questions.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.880
So, you didn't arrest her?

39:53.920 --> 39:56.080
No cause to, sir.

39:56.120 --> 40:01.320
So, I came all the way down here to watch

39:56.120 --> 40:01.320
you bring her in.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.480
Sorry, sir.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.320
It's disappointing, I know.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.520
I checked the firearms register

40:20.560 --> 40:22.800
and guess who owns a .45

40:25.240 --> 40:26.960
Right. I'll drive this time.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.880
-I'm an excellent driver. -No, you're not.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.200
MARC: This is practically harassment.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.680
HUMPHREY: We appreciate your co-operation.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.440
Never even use the damn thing.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.520
Then why keep it?

40:39.280 --> 40:40.800
It's a dangerous world.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.800
A man has a right to protect his own property.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.480
Does that include his wife?

40:47.320 --> 40:49.800
There you go. Knock yourself out.

40:52.720 --> 40:53.800
HUMPHREY: It's gone.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.680
-It's not there.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.520
I can't understand. It was... It was here.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.040
When was the last time you saw it?

41:03.640 --> 41:05.560
I cleaned it a week ago.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.120
Did you lock the safe afterwards?

41:08.160 --> 41:09.640
Of course I locked it.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.680
Who else has access to the key?

41:17.040 --> 41:18.640
Campese's lying.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.120
He did seem genuinely surprised

41:18.680 --> 41:21.120
to find it wasn't in the safe.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.120
Someone else could have broken into the club

41:21.160 --> 41:23.120
and stole the gun.

41:23.160 --> 41:27.160
Come on. The Reef Club's security

41:23.160 --> 41:27.160
system is state-of-the-art.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.240
Only a pro could be able to breach it undetected.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.920
And they'd also have to have access to the key.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.920
All right, but why would she kill him?

41:32.960 --> 41:34.520
They were going to America together.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.960
No, they weren't. Carlton was all set to go.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.840
But not Lauren.

41:39.880 --> 41:43.120
Her passport had been out of date

41:39.880 --> 41:43.120
for the past two years.

41:43.160 --> 41:46.720
Carlton booked flights, but there's no way Lauren

41:43.160 --> 41:46.720
could have travelled.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.080
Why are you checking up on this?

41:57.120 --> 41:59.960
Because we do routine background checks

41:57.120 --> 41:59.960
on all suspects.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.400
You know that... Sergeant.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.040
CAMILLE: We know Carlton was killed by a woman.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.360
We need to bring her in, Fidel.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.480
Just give me half an hour.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.080
Okay.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.560
Is it Marc

42:28.600 --> 42:30.320
-The one you took

42:28.600 --> 42:30.320
from the safe.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.480
-You had no intention

42:30.360 --> 42:32.480
of leaving.

42:32.520 --> 42:35.720
What? Of course I did. I told you, New York,

42:32.520 --> 42:35.720
we were flying out...

42:35.760 --> 42:36.920
Without a passport?

42:46.840 --> 42:49.120
I don't know why I didn't renew it.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.360
I wanted to go. I was just...

42:54.760 --> 42:56.240
Of everything.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.200
Of leaving Marc, the island.

43:00.240 --> 43:03.600
Of starting a new life with Carlton.

43:00.240 --> 43:03.600
What if it didn't work?

43:03.640 --> 43:07.080
Look, you know what he was like.

43:03.640 --> 43:07.080
Nothing ever frightened him.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.120
It was all one big adventure. Me?

43:12.000 --> 43:13.200
I'm a coward.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.600
I wish I wasn't.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.520
I wish I'd left with him. Then he'd still be alive.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.440
What about the gun?

43:27.480 --> 43:30.160
Okay, I took the gun. But only to give it

43:27.480 --> 43:30.160
to Carlton for protection.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.000
-From Marc.

43:33.040 --> 43:36.480
Look, when he found out about the affair,

43:33.040 --> 43:36.480
he was livid.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.960
He said that he was going to deal with Carlton

43:36.520 --> 43:38.960
and he meant it.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.440
I had to do something.

43:42.680 --> 43:44.040
So, I took the gun.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.400
I don't know if I was protecting Carlton from Marc.

43:47.440 --> 43:50.160
Or Marc from himself. I went round to Carlton's.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.600
I told him that Marc knew and that he should

43:50.200 --> 43:52.600
take the gun

43:52.640 --> 43:54.960
just in case something happened.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.240
And what did Carlton say?

43:57.920 --> 44:00.080
He didn't want it.

44:00.120 --> 44:02.520
He said he wasn't afraid of Marc.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.000
But what happened with the gun?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.040
Well, I left it there.

44:06.080 --> 44:09.080
-We didn't find it, Lauren. -No...

44:11.600 --> 44:14.640
I did not kill Carlton. I loved him.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.480
HUMPHREY: How is she?

44:26.520 --> 44:28.320
She's scared.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.760
-No, not really.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.640
Looks like a fun night.

44:50.280 --> 44:53.360
FIDEL: Yeah. One of the best.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.040
Carlton was a handsome boy.

44:56.680 --> 44:58.680
And he knew it.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.760
<i>Bonjour,</i> Catherine. Oh, boy.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.680
-Yeah.

45:08.960 --> 45:12.400
Listen, about the passport check...

45:13.240 --> 45:14.400
You were doing your job.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.640
Sorry about Lauren.

45:18.680 --> 45:22.280
Yeah, me too. I wish I could help her.

45:22.320 --> 45:26.120
Yes, it's a pity we can't find the gun.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.280
She said she left it at the villa.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.440
And you believe her?

45:28.480 --> 45:30.400
-Yes. -Then let's go

45:28.480 --> 45:30.400
and look for it.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.240
Dwayne, we searched the grounds

45:30.440 --> 45:32.240
and the house already.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.000
Then let's search them again.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.360
Come on.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.040
Honore Police.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.520
Sir?

45:55.560 --> 45:57.080
What you doing here?

45:57.120 --> 45:58.720
Looking for the gun. You?

45:58.760 --> 45:59.800
Same.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.600
So you believe Lauren's story?

46:01.640 --> 46:03.560
Let's just say I have a lot of questions

46:01.640 --> 46:03.560
that remain unanswered. Like what?

46:06.040 --> 46:07.480
Well, for starters, we're looking for a woman

46:06.040 --> 46:07.480
who hated Carlton enough

46:07.520 --> 46:09.120
to want to kill him.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.720
Problem is every woman we've spoken to

46:09.160 --> 46:11.720
absolutely loved him.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.640
And why take the mobile phone?

46:13.680 --> 46:16.320
And why not call you when he was in trouble?

46:16.360 --> 46:18.160
You're a good friend, you were close by...

46:19.320 --> 46:20.320
I wasn't a good friend.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.480
I cut off all contact with him when I graduated

46:25.000 --> 46:27.480
from police college.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.960
Ah, I see.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.080
It wasn't easy, but...

46:35.120 --> 46:37.240
But being friends with a male escort

46:35.120 --> 46:37.240
would have been a bit awkward.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.400
Do you think I was wrong?

46:43.360 --> 46:47.960
Well, can't have friendship without mutual respect.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.320
Golden rule, don't do anything

46:48.000 --> 46:50.320
to harm each other.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.480
Exactly. And Carlton being an escort,

46:52.520 --> 46:54.240
I didn't think it was a good idea for me

46:54.280 --> 46:55.880
to be around him as a police officer...

46:55.920 --> 46:59.920
Then again, friendship's not

46:55.920 --> 46:59.920
really about rules.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.680
It's about sticking by each other no matter what.

47:03.080 --> 47:07.640
You're right. I let him down.

47:07.680 --> 47:10.440
I threw away my best friend because I thought

47:07.680 --> 47:10.440
he'd reflect badly on me.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.920
What did you just say?

47:15.960 --> 47:20.120
Carlton's job. I was too worried

47:15.960 --> 47:20.120
about how it reflected on me.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.080
Reflect.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.720
Carlton loved art.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.080
<i>It inspired him.</i>

47:35.040 --> 47:39.000
There she was, demanding that

47:35.040 --> 47:39.000
Carlton let her in.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.520
It was here.

47:42.520 --> 47:43.840
What time is it?

47:43.880 --> 47:45.520
Er, it's almost 5:00.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.280
Right! Okay.

47:47.320 --> 47:51.920
Go and pick up Camille, and I will meet you both there

47:47.320 --> 47:51.920
in an hour.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.120
Meet us where?

47:53.920 --> 47:55.280
The gallery, of course.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.960
The auction should have started

47:57.040 --> 47:59.960
half an hour ago.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.560
My customers are getting very restless.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.280
We are waiting for DI Goodman.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.680
-He said he'd be here.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.800
Sorry. Sorry to keep you all waiting.

48:34.080 --> 48:35.320
Where's Mr Campese?

48:36.360 --> 48:38.080
Probably changing the locks.

48:39.240 --> 48:40.560
You want us to arrest him.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.400
No, actually, that won't be necessary.

48:45.280 --> 48:46.280
Why not?

48:47.560 --> 48:48.880
Because he didn't do it.

48:54.880 --> 48:58.000
Before we begin, I think we should

48:54.880 --> 48:58.000
all take a moment to reflect

48:58.040 --> 49:01.040
upon the work of Albert Peter Dunn.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.480
And who is Albert Peter Dunn?

49:07.960 --> 49:09.680
He was a travel writer.

49:09.720 --> 49:13.800
Not a good travel writer, but a very thorough one.

49:13.840 --> 49:17.880
He came to Saint Marie in 1929 while researching this.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.960
<i>Walks of the Caribbean,</i>

49:21.000 --> 49:24.160
a set of three books describing every hike,

49:24.200 --> 49:28.080
stroll and ramble in the region.

49:28.120 --> 49:31.760
This is <i> Volume II.</i> 500 pages long.

49:31.800 --> 49:36.600
Crammed full of meticulous detail

49:31.800 --> 49:36.600
and painstaking research.

49:36.640 --> 49:40.840
It also happens to be very, very dull.

49:40.880 --> 49:43.880
Sorry, is there a point to this?

49:45.760 --> 49:48.400
Yes. The point?

49:48.440 --> 49:51.480
Well, the point is that, like Albert Dunn,

49:51.520 --> 49:53.920
Carlton was also very thorough.

49:53.960 --> 49:56.400
We know that he went to great lengths

49:53.960 --> 49:56.400
to research his clients

49:56.440 --> 49:57.960
and their interests.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.760
Probably what made him so good at his job.

50:00.800 --> 50:04.880
He took the time to get to know them,

50:00.800 --> 50:04.880
to find out who they were

50:04.920 --> 50:07.000
and what they needed.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.760
Carlton played a different role for each of his clients.

50:11.440 --> 50:12.720
Sometimes as a lover.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.200
Sometimes a friend.

50:22.880 --> 50:24.000
Er, sorry...

50:26.320 --> 50:28.000
No, not that one.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.400
Er...

50:31.680 --> 50:33.520
Yes! Right!

50:33.560 --> 50:38.800
So, let's start with what we think we know

50:33.560 --> 50:38.800
about the night Carlton died.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.520
<i>At 7:00 Carlton</i> <i>leaves the gallery</i>

50:41.560 --> 50:44.520
<i>because he had an argument</i> <i>with Marc Campese.</i>

50:44.560 --> 50:47.840
<i>Outside he tells</i> <i>Dorothy Foster</i>

50:44.560 --> 50:47.840
<i>he'll be back soon.</i>

50:47.880 --> 50:51.840
<i>At 8:15 he refuses to</i> <i>answer his door to Dorothy.</i>

50:51.880 --> 50:53.680
<i>At 8:30 he makes a call</i> <i>to the police</i>

50:53.720 --> 50:55.640
<i>and says that a woman</i> <i>is trying to kill him.</i>

50:55.680 --> 50:58.400
<i>And some time between then</i> <i>and 8:35,</i>

50:58.440 --> 51:01.000
<i>Carlton Paris is shot dead.</i>

51:02.120 --> 51:04.600
And not one of those statements is true.

51:10.760 --> 51:12.960
It was all one big con.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.960
Oh, actually, wait,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.960
the part about Carlton saying he was coming

51:18.000 --> 51:20.960
back to the gallery,

51:21.000 --> 51:22.760
that was true.

51:22.800 --> 51:25.400
But everything else was a lie.

51:28.480 --> 51:31.800
Carlton didn't leave the gallery because

51:28.480 --> 51:31.800
he was angry at Mr Campese.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.920
In fact, he'd already planned to go.

51:34.960 --> 51:37.880
And it wasn't that he wouldn't open his door to Dorothy.

51:37.920 --> 51:42.000
But rather that he couldn't open his door.

51:42.040 --> 51:44.720
And he never made a call to the police

51:44.760 --> 51:48.080
and he wasn't shot between 8:30 and 8:35.

51:49.240 --> 51:52.040
So, back to the start again

51:52.080 --> 51:55.200
and the real reason why Carlton left the gallery.

51:55.240 --> 51:57.360
He was going home to fetch something.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.760
To fetch what, exactly?

52:02.760 --> 52:04.760
<i>Walks of the Caribbean,</i> of course.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.920
See, Carlton spotted something in this book

52:09.960 --> 52:13.360
that would have caused a bit of a scandal.

52:13.400 --> 52:17.520
Albert Dunn's description of his walk around

52:13.400 --> 52:17.520
Saint Marie Harbour.

52:18.600 --> 52:21.920
"The harbour is quaint, yet little used,

52:21.960 --> 52:25.160
"save for a few local fishing boats.

52:25.200 --> 52:28.040
"The waters around Saint Marie are too treacherous

52:28.080 --> 52:30.760
"for any larger vessels to chance.

52:30.800 --> 52:33.040
"However, this may soon change

52:34.480 --> 52:38.040
"as a lighthouse is currently being erected."

52:46.960 --> 52:49.080
That would be this lighthouse here,

52:49.120 --> 52:50.920
the one reflected in the bottle.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.280
The one built in 1929.

52:55.320 --> 52:59.360
Two years after the artist had died.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.440
Looked it up in your catalogue.

53:03.840 --> 53:04.960
So, you see...

53:07.080 --> 53:11.240
There is no way that Durosseau could have

53:07.080 --> 53:11.240
painted that painting.

53:11.280 --> 53:15.400
And that's how Carlton knew that <i> The Girl from the Mermaid</i>

53:11.280 --> 53:15.400
is a fake.

53:17.200 --> 53:18.960
This is ridiculous.

53:22.120 --> 53:24.520
Carlton told you of his suspicions.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.120
Thank you for sharing.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.680
I can bring the proof to you.

53:27.720 --> 53:30.120
Ah. The glamour has arrived.

53:30.160 --> 53:33.120
HUMPHREY: <i> He must have</i> <i>thought that you were</i>

53:30.160 --> 53:33.120
<i>a victim of a fraud.</i>

53:33.160 --> 53:34.560
<i>He can't have known</i> <i>that you were involved</i>

53:34.600 --> 53:36.600
<i>or he would have exposed</i> <i>you there and then.</i>

53:37.560 --> 53:39.160
<i>You knew</i>

53:39.200 --> 53:41.240
<i>that if he came back</i> <i>with that proof,</i>

53:41.280 --> 53:44.520
<i>well, then you could say</i> <i>goodbye to that quarter</i>

53:41.280 --> 53:44.520
<i>of a million dollars.</i>

53:44.560 --> 53:49.040
<i>And if it was discovered</i> <i>that you knew it was a fake,</i>

53:49.080 --> 53:51.960
<i>well, then you'd be facing</i> <i>a lengthy jail sentence.</i>

53:57.840 --> 53:59.520
<i>You went off</i> <i>to Carlton's villa.</i>

54:02.720 --> 54:05.000
<i>I imagine you tried to reason</i> <i>with him at first,</i>

54:05.040 --> 54:07.800
<i>maybe even tried to bribe him</i> <i>with a cut of the auction fee.</i>

54:07.840 --> 54:10.360
<i>But Carlton,</i> <i>Carlton wouldn't bite.</i>

54:14.480 --> 54:18.080
<i>And then it appeared</i> <i>before you,</i>

54:14.480 --> 54:18.080
<i>Marc Campese's gun.</i>

54:29.280 --> 54:33.520
<i>You took the book</i> <i>and you were about</i>

54:29.280 --> 54:33.520
<i>to leave when...</i>

54:33.560 --> 54:36.440
<i>You saw a chance</i> <i>to cover your tracks.</i>

54:36.480 --> 54:38.560
<i>Carlton's mobile phone.</i>

54:42.960 --> 54:48.320
<i>The deed done,</i> <i>you returned to your guests</i>

54:42.960 --> 54:48.320
<i>as if nothing had happened.</i>

54:48.360 --> 54:50.960
Come the end of the night, you had one more con to play.

54:54.840 --> 54:58.000
<i>A phone call</i> <i>to the police station</i>

54:54.840 --> 54:58.000
<i>using Carlton's phone</i>

54:58.040 --> 55:00.440
<i>to make it seem like</i> <i>he was still alive.</i>

55:00.480 --> 55:01.600
DWAYNE: <i> Hello?</i>

55:01.640 --> 55:02.960
: Hello? Police.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.600
My name is Carlton Paris. I'm at 125 Shore Road.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.040
She's got a gun...

55:11.560 --> 55:13.800
Hey

55:16.280 --> 55:19.600
A nice touch with that "She's got a gun."

55:19.640 --> 55:21.000
What with Carlton being an escort,

55:21.040 --> 55:23.840
you knew we'd be looking at one of his clients.

55:23.880 --> 55:25.960
And the phone call made us think

55:23.880 --> 55:25.960
that Carlton was still alive

55:26.000 --> 55:29.880
an hour after you killed him...

55:29.920 --> 55:35.240
When you had two police officers who could

55:29.920 --> 55:35.240
vouch for your alibi.

55:35.280 --> 55:38.640
See, Carlton never called his friend when

55:35.280 --> 55:38.640
he was in trouble

55:38.680 --> 55:40.560
because it wasn't him making the call.

55:43.240 --> 55:44.680
You managed to fake a murder.

55:47.280 --> 55:49.960
Shame that you couldn't fake a painting.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.520
Top drawer, I guess.

56:09.960 --> 56:13.840
Just as I thought. <i>Walks of the Caribbean</i>

56:09.960 --> 56:13.840
<i>Volume II.</i>

56:13.880 --> 56:16.040
No doubt covered with Carlton's fingerprints.

56:16.080 --> 56:18.280
-It's Carlton's.

56:18.320 --> 56:19.880
All the evidence we need, I'd say.

56:31.440 --> 56:33.960
I'll buy them from you for a penny.

56:34.800 --> 56:35.800
What?

56:38.320 --> 56:42.160
Your thoughts. That's what English

56:38.320 --> 56:42.160
people say, isn't it?

56:42.200 --> 56:44.080
"I'll pay one penny for your thought."

56:44.120 --> 56:45.560
-You mean "a penny" for them. -Yeah.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.600
-That's what I said. -Yes, almost.

56:50.960 --> 56:54.120
You're not going to do your baked beans on toast

56:50.960 --> 56:54.120
speech again?

56:54.160 --> 56:55.320
-No. -I don't mind.

56:55.360 --> 56:56.360
-No! -Cool.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.320
I suppose I am a bit lonely.

57:00.560 --> 57:02.160
Bound to be, I've been with Sally, you see.

57:02.200 --> 57:04.960
And now I'm not. And it takes

57:02.200 --> 57:04.960
a bit of adjusting.

57:06.520 --> 57:08.680
Even looked at an Internet dating site.

57:08.720 --> 57:11.520
Did you do it? -No.

57:11.560 --> 57:14.000
But there might be someone out there, just waiting for you...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.920
Well, I'm afraid I fell at the first hurdle,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.920
you see.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.800
It said "Name your three

57:20.960 --> 57:22.800
best qualities."

57:22.840 --> 57:26.480
I put catching murderers as my number one, then

57:22.840 --> 57:26.480
I sort of ran out of steam.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.000
Don't suppose you can think of anything else?

57:31.720 --> 57:33.240
Er...

57:33.280 --> 57:34.840
No.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.120
Ah, right. Thought not.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.240
I'm teasing.

57:39.280 --> 57:44.040
You can put that you're kind, you're handsome,

57:39.280 --> 57:44.040
and you're very sexy...

57:44.880 --> 57:46.560
Really?

57:46.600 --> 57:50.120
Of course! It's Internet.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.480
Everyone lies.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.160
You missed quite a party last night.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.320
Yeah? Well, I reckon there'll be

58:08.200 --> 58:09.320
another one tonight!

58:09.360 --> 58:11.120
Ms Thiebert?

58:11.160 --> 58:14.560
Natasha Thiebert, a 35-year-old air hostess.

58:11.160 --> 58:14.560
Suspicious death.

58:14.600 --> 58:18.040
I could think of 100 flight attendants that

58:14.600 --> 58:18.040
people would gladly murder...

58:18.080 --> 58:19.600
Max. But not Natasha.

58:19.640 --> 58:22.680
We found some fingerprints in Natasha's room.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.680
Okay, do you want to see the real Saint Marie?

58:24.720 --> 58:26.080
Yes.
