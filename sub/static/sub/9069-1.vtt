hmm, hmm, hmm.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.109
a friend of yours?

14:09.546 --> 14:11.246
have you any idea
who killed him?

14:11.281 --> 14:13.148
i have no idea.

14:13.183 --> 14:14.983
<i>she</i> killed him.
what?

14:15.018 --> 14:15.984
that's not true.

14:16.019 --> 14:17.386
she says
it's not true.

14:17.420 --> 14:18.354
she is lying.

14:18.388 --> 14:19.621
you watch your tongue.

14:19.656 --> 14:21.156
i heard 4 shots,
monsieur.

14:21.191 --> 14:22.725
ah, you
<i>heard</i> 4 shots.

14:22.759 --> 14:24.360
you did not <i>see</i> 4--

14:24.394 --> 14:26.295
oh. i am sorry.

14:26.329 --> 14:28.063
you did not <i>see</i>
these 4 shots?

14:28.098 --> 14:29.365
no, monsieur.

14:29.399 --> 14:31.333
no. well, then you
could not possibly know

14:31.368 --> 14:32.668
who fired those shots.

14:32.702 --> 14:33.736
the door was locked,
monsieur,

14:33.770 --> 14:34.837
from the inside.

14:34.871 --> 14:36.372
so what does
that prove?

14:36.406 --> 14:37.873
when i broke it open,

14:37.907 --> 14:39.375
i found miquel
where you see him now

14:39.409 --> 14:41.877
and maria with a gun
in her hand.

14:41.911 --> 14:43.645
with the gun
in her hand?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.247
still smoking.

14:45.281 --> 14:48.183
did you have the gun
in your hand?

14:49.686 --> 14:51.754
and was it still smoking?

14:51.788 --> 14:53.622
i suppose so, but...

14:53.656 --> 14:55.958
i don't know
how it got there.

14:55.992 --> 14:57.159
i really don't.

14:57.193 --> 14:58.560
ridiculous.

14:58.595 --> 15:00.329
<i>i</i> will decide
what is ridiculous.

15:00.363 --> 15:02.064
monsieur, you surely
don't believe--

15:02.098 --> 15:04.199
i believe everything...

15:04.234 --> 15:06.168
and i believe nothing.

15:06.202 --> 15:08.737
i suspect everyone...

15:08.772 --> 15:10.706
and i suspect no one.

15:12.242 --> 15:14.343
i gather the facts...

15:14.377 --> 15:16.812
examine the clues...

15:16.846 --> 15:18.714
and before you know it...

15:18.748 --> 15:20.015
the case is solved.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.583
hmph.

15:21.618 --> 15:23.952
oh, yes, there is much here
that does not meet the eye--

15:23.987 --> 15:26.388
hmm, that is quite obvious.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.225
ahem.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.860
what was that you said?

15:31.895 --> 15:33.128
nothing, monsieur.

15:33.163 --> 15:35.497
hmm, all right.

15:35.532 --> 15:37.299
you can go now.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.368
yes, monsieur.

15:39.402 --> 15:42.604
but, uh, do not
try to leave.

15:42.639 --> 15:45.774
everyone in this household
is under suspicion.

15:45.809 --> 15:46.975
yes, monsieur.

15:54.818 --> 15:55.918
ahem.

16:00.457 --> 16:03.158
clouseau: now, supposing you
tell me what happened.

16:03.193 --> 16:05.294
he was having difficulty
with the buttons.

16:05.328 --> 16:06.662
buttons?

16:06.696 --> 16:08.063
buttons on my dress.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.232
well, you know,
that is very strange

16:10.266 --> 16:13.135
because there are
no buttons on this dress.

16:13.169 --> 16:14.636
well, that is because

16:14.671 --> 16:16.171
he was having difficulty
with them,

16:16.206 --> 16:18.640
so he just tore
the dress off.

16:18.675 --> 16:19.908
he attacked you?

16:19.943 --> 16:21.076
oh, no.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.078
i would have
helped him, but...

16:23.112 --> 16:24.646
but he couldn't wait.

16:24.681 --> 16:27.583
the buttons are probably
all over the room.

16:27.617 --> 16:29.818
he was so impetuous.

16:29.853 --> 16:32.554
a passionate spaniard,
you know.

16:36.059 --> 16:38.660
and, uh, he...

16:38.695 --> 16:40.429
tore your dress off, eh?

16:40.463 --> 16:41.730
yes.

16:41.764 --> 16:44.299
and then suddenly
someone opened the door,

16:44.334 --> 16:45.801
and miquel leapt up
and...

16:45.835 --> 16:47.703
well, that is
the last i remember

16:47.737 --> 16:48.904
until maurice came in

16:48.938 --> 16:50.239
and found me
with the gun.

16:50.273 --> 16:52.107
hmm...

16:52.141 --> 16:53.575
yes.

16:53.610 --> 16:55.844
there is,
if you'll excuse me,

16:55.879 --> 16:58.347
something here that
i do not quite understand.

16:58.381 --> 16:59.648
what don't you
understand?

16:59.682 --> 17:00.816
[sucks]

17:00.850 --> 17:01.817
ew.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.088
i don't understand...

17:06.122 --> 17:10.058
ahem, when you say
that you don't remember.

17:10.093 --> 17:12.361
well, i guess
i was unconscious.

17:12.395 --> 17:13.561
unconscious?

17:13.596 --> 17:14.930
i have a bump.

17:14.964 --> 17:15.931
bump?
yes.

17:15.964 --> 17:17.031
where?

17:17.066 --> 17:18.967
oh, let me see.

17:19.002 --> 17:20.301
oh, yes.

17:20.336 --> 17:22.003
i don't know
how it happened,

17:22.038 --> 17:23.505
but it is so painful.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.540
oh, that is beautiful
perfume you're wearing.

17:25.575 --> 17:26.575
it's bath oil.

17:26.608 --> 17:27.843
is it?

17:27.877 --> 17:29.645
you know, i really
can't figure it out.

17:29.679 --> 17:31.613
it's--someone
must have hit me.

17:31.648 --> 17:34.116
yes. you have received
a mild concussion

17:34.150 --> 17:35.884
with that bump.

17:35.919 --> 17:37.185
you have cream
on your nose.

17:37.220 --> 17:38.687
what? oh, it's nothing.

17:38.721 --> 17:40.789
it's--it's from that,
uh...thing over there.

17:40.823 --> 17:41.857
you're all wet.

17:41.891 --> 17:42.858
what? oh, yes.

17:42.892 --> 17:43.992
is it raining?

17:44.027 --> 17:45.394
no. it's just that,
uh...

17:45.428 --> 17:46.695
stupid driver of mine

17:46.729 --> 17:48.163
parked too close
to the fountain.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.198
you should get out of
these clothes immediately.

17:50.233 --> 17:52.301
you'll catch your death
of pneumonia, you will.

17:52.335 --> 17:55.237
hmm. yes, yes,
i probably will, but, uh...

17:55.271 --> 17:58.206
it's all part of life's
rich pageant, you know.

17:58.241 --> 18:01.243
we police have to put up
with a lot of things--ha ha--

18:01.277 --> 18:03.412
in the course
of our duty that, uh...

18:03.446 --> 18:05.981
in private life, one
wouldn't normally tolerate.

18:06.015 --> 18:07.816
why don't we
have a smoke?

18:07.850 --> 18:09.318
helps to calm
the nerves...

18:09.352 --> 18:13.121
and, uh...enable us
to think more clearly.

18:13.156 --> 18:14.356
[chuckles]

18:16.693 --> 18:19.161
lovely perfume
you're wearing there.

18:19.195 --> 18:21.363
that's not perfume.
that's bath oil.

18:21.397 --> 18:22.664
oh, is it?

18:22.699 --> 18:24.466
well,
it's very beautiful.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.601
thank you.

18:25.635 --> 18:28.403
i can still smell it.

18:28.438 --> 18:30.305
now, where were we?

18:30.340 --> 18:31.573
my bump.

18:31.608 --> 18:33.141
bump, that's right--

18:33.176 --> 18:35.978
uh, that--that you received
when somebody hit you,

18:36.012 --> 18:38.680
or at least we presume,
uh, somebody hit you.

18:38.715 --> 18:40.315
how else could it
have happened?

18:40.350 --> 18:41.817
well, you see,
in the police force,

18:41.851 --> 18:44.119
first, we presume,
after, we find out.

18:44.153 --> 18:45.821
that is the way we work--
always work like that

18:45.855 --> 18:47.356
because if we work
the other way, you see--

18:47.390 --> 18:50.092
my goodness, it's a bit
stuffy in here.

18:50.126 --> 18:51.627
your coat!

18:51.661 --> 18:53.161
yes, it is my coat.

18:53.196 --> 18:54.630
but it's on fire!

18:54.664 --> 18:55.664
what?!

18:55.698 --> 18:56.632
oh!

18:56.666 --> 18:58.133
my coat is on fire!

18:58.167 --> 19:00.168
my goodness,
i'm burning!

19:00.203 --> 19:01.269
oh!

19:05.174 --> 19:06.141
clouseau?

19:06.175 --> 19:07.142
clouseau: aah!

19:07.176 --> 19:08.610
he fell out
of the window!

19:09.679 --> 19:11.113
dreyfus: clouseau?

19:17.520 --> 19:19.521
maria:
are you all right?

19:19.555 --> 19:20.822
hmm? oh, yes.

19:20.857 --> 19:22.691
i am perfectly
all right.

19:22.725 --> 19:23.859
thank you.

19:23.893 --> 19:25.794
in that case,
you may go home.

19:27.664 --> 19:28.797
go home?

19:28.831 --> 19:30.265
dreyfus:
you are relieved.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.266
relieved?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.768
i am taking charge.

19:32.802 --> 19:34.102
good night, clouseau.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.107
good night, sir.

19:42.278 --> 19:44.246
[frogs croaking]

19:47.817 --> 19:49.651
aah! ah!

19:49.686 --> 19:51.119
sorry, inspector.

19:51.154 --> 19:52.587
you idiot! you fool!

19:54.190 --> 19:56.725
it's a good job i was
able to check my reflexes.

19:56.759 --> 19:58.794
i might've killed you
with a karate chop!

20:01.230 --> 20:02.130
oh!

20:02.165 --> 20:03.632
oh, you...

20:04.867 --> 20:06.401
you fool!

20:07.904 --> 20:10.472
just for that you're--
you're off the case.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.181
[car starts]

20:19.215 --> 20:20.615
back to town.

20:28.891 --> 20:30.659
when can i have
the report?

20:30.693 --> 20:32.194
i'll give you
a report

20:32.228 --> 20:33.662
first thing
in the morning.

20:33.696 --> 20:34.963
right. thank you.

20:34.997 --> 20:36.131
excuse me.

20:36.165 --> 20:37.666
uh, monsieur ballon?

20:37.700 --> 20:38.667
yes.

20:38.701 --> 20:40.202
i'm commissioner dreyfus.

20:40.236 --> 20:43.238
ah, well, uh, where's
inspector clouseau?

20:43.272 --> 20:44.639
i am personally
taking charge

20:44.674 --> 20:45.941
of this investigation.

20:45.975 --> 20:47.175
oh, i see.

20:47.210 --> 20:49.144
i promise that you
and madame ballon

20:49.178 --> 20:51.213
will be inconvenienced
as little as possible,

20:51.247 --> 20:53.148
and that the ballon name
will not suffer

20:53.182 --> 20:55.117
the, uh, sensationalism
of the press.

20:55.151 --> 20:57.119
he was a strange fellow,
but i rather liked him.

20:57.153 --> 20:58.120
huh?

20:58.154 --> 20:59.621
uh, i mean clouseau.

20:59.655 --> 21:00.622
oh. yes.

21:00.656 --> 21:02.657
yes, he's a--hmm-hmm.

21:02.692 --> 21:04.126
he's an
extraordinary man.

21:19.776 --> 21:21.743
[creaking]

21:39.829 --> 21:41.096
yaaah!

21:52.775 --> 21:53.775

inspector clouseau's
residence.

22:32.181 --> 22:33.648
one moment, please.

22:33.683 --> 22:35.116
commissioner dreyfus.

22:36.886 --> 22:38.687
[breathing heavily]

22:38.721 --> 22:40.622
[loud panting
audible over phone]

22:42.191 --> 22:44.159
hello,
inspector clouseau here.

22:44.193 --> 22:45.894
get down here
immediately.

22:45.928 --> 22:47.863
you're back
on the gambrelli case.

22:47.897 --> 22:49.331
the gambrelli case?

22:49.365 --> 22:51.166
maria gambrelli.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.735
the maid who killed
the chauffeur.

22:53.769 --> 22:55.503
oh! maria gambrelli
the maid!

22:55.538 --> 22:56.705
yes. yes, excellent.

22:56.739 --> 22:58.440
i'll be down there
right away.

22:58.474 --> 22:59.641
thank you.

22:59.675 --> 23:01.810
well, kato,
i am back on the case.

23:01.844 --> 23:02.878
hyah-san!

23:02.912 --> 23:04.446
i tell you,

23:04.480 --> 23:06.147
maria gambrelli
is beautiful, innocent.

23:06.182 --> 23:07.115
hyah!

23:07.149 --> 23:09.150
[objects clanging]

23:09.185 --> 23:10.285
by the way, kato,

23:10.319 --> 23:11.653
that was a very good
workout today.

23:11.687 --> 23:13.154
you're showing
marked improvement.

23:13.189 --> 23:15.290
every day
you're getting better.

23:16.359 --> 23:17.292
hut. <i>hai.</i>

23:18.494 --> 23:19.461
<i>ha sai.</i>

23:21.831 --> 23:24.532
facts, hercule, facts.

23:24.567 --> 23:27.369
nothing matters
but the facts.

23:27.403 --> 23:28.703
without them,

23:28.738 --> 23:30.772
the science
of criminal investigation

23:30.806 --> 23:33.141
is nothing more
than a guessing game.

23:33.175 --> 23:35.176
[unable to snap]

23:35.211 --> 23:36.645
you listen to me,
hercule,

23:36.679 --> 23:38.213
and you will learn
something.

23:38.247 --> 23:41.783
now then, the facts
in this case are:

23:41.817 --> 23:43.318
the body
of the chauffeur

23:43.352 --> 23:45.420
was found in the bedroom
of the second maid.

23:45.454 --> 23:46.688
fact!

23:46.722 --> 23:49.658
cause of death:
4 bullets in the chest.

23:49.692 --> 23:51.126
fact!

23:51.160 --> 23:53.628
the bullets were fired
at close range

23:53.663 --> 23:56.164
from a .25 caliber
beretta automatic.

23:56.198 --> 23:57.666
fact!

23:57.700 --> 23:59.634
maria gambrelli
was discovered

23:59.669 --> 24:01.670
with the murder weapon
in her hand.

24:01.704 --> 24:03.171
fact!

24:03.205 --> 24:05.206
the murder weapon
was registered

24:05.241 --> 24:07.175
in the name
of the deceased--

24:07.209 --> 24:08.176
miquel osto--

24:08.210 --> 24:09.644
and was kept, mark you,

24:09.679 --> 24:12.681
in the glove compartment
of the ballon rolls royce.

24:12.715 --> 24:14.182
fact!

24:14.216 --> 24:16.651
now then, members
of the household staff

24:16.686 --> 24:19.154
have testified
that miquel osto beat--

24:21.157 --> 24:22.657
careful, you fool.

24:22.692 --> 24:24.125
you've broken
my pointing stick.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.661
i've got nothing
to point with now.

24:26.696 --> 24:29.130
have--have testified
that--that...

24:29.165 --> 24:30.498
that miquel osto

24:30.533 --> 24:32.133
beat maria gambrelli
frequently!

24:32.168 --> 24:33.835
and, now, finally,

24:33.869 --> 24:35.337
comes the sworn
statement

24:35.371 --> 24:37.138
of monsieur
and madame ballon,

24:37.173 --> 24:39.641
as well as all the members
of the staff--

24:39.675 --> 24:42.110
each of them
with perfect alibis.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.680
now then, hercule...

24:45.715 --> 24:48.116
what is the inescapable
conclusion?

24:49.552 --> 24:52.187
maria gambrelli
killed the chauffeur.

24:52.221 --> 24:53.121
what?

24:53.155 --> 24:54.689
you idiot. impossible!

24:54.724 --> 24:56.157
she's protecting someone.

24:56.192 --> 24:57.225
how do you know that?

24:57.259 --> 24:58.360
instinct.

24:58.394 --> 24:59.661
but the facts?

24:59.695 --> 25:01.696
you are forgetting
the most important fact.

25:01.731 --> 25:02.630
motive.

25:02.665 --> 25:03.698
he beat her.

25:03.733 --> 25:05.100
he was spanish.

25:05.134 --> 25:06.634
he tore her dress off.

25:06.669 --> 25:08.136
oh, don't be ridiculous.

25:08.170 --> 25:11.139
would you kill somebody
who tore your dress off?

25:11.173 --> 25:13.108
no, i--i suppose not.

25:13.142 --> 25:14.642
no, of course not.

25:14.677 --> 25:16.444
no. no.

25:16.479 --> 25:20.015
well, there is no doubt in
my mind whatsoever, hercule.

25:20.049 --> 25:23.151
maria gambrelli is most
definitely protecting somebody.

25:23.185 --> 25:24.686
find that somebody,

25:24.720 --> 25:26.287
and you have found
the murderer.

25:26.322 --> 25:28.156
and, uh...

25:28.190 --> 25:30.892
i shall find the murderer
before the day is out.

25:30.926 --> 25:33.795
maria gambrelli
will tell me who he is.

25:33.829 --> 25:35.263
oh, yes.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.333
what was that you said?

25:39.368 --> 25:40.368
uh, nothing.

25:40.403 --> 25:41.336
i see.

25:41.370 --> 25:42.637
all right.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.439
well, you can go,
hercule.

26:03.626 --> 26:04.592
aah!

26:11.667 --> 26:13.101
i don't understand.

26:13.135 --> 26:15.103
why, in the name
of heaven,

26:15.137 --> 26:16.571
did you reassign
clouseau

26:16.605 --> 26:18.106
to the gambrelli case?

26:18.140 --> 26:20.108
that is a good question,

26:20.142 --> 26:22.143
and it deserves an answer.

26:22.178 --> 26:24.646
but what i'm
about to tell you

26:24.680 --> 26:27.115
must remain in
the strictest confidence.

26:27.149 --> 26:29.150
this morning at 6:00,

26:29.185 --> 26:32.087
i received a phone call
from a superior.

26:32.121 --> 26:34.122
i was informed

26:34.156 --> 26:36.791
that certain extremely
influential parties

26:36.826 --> 26:40.028
were interested in having
clouseau back on the case.

26:41.163 --> 26:43.098
i had no choice
but to comply.

26:43.132 --> 26:44.599
amazing.

26:44.633 --> 26:47.669
if i were to divulge
the identity of the caller,

26:47.703 --> 26:49.971
you'd realize how amazing
it really is.

26:50.005 --> 26:51.072
but why?

26:51.107 --> 26:52.674
that's another
good question.

26:52.708 --> 26:54.175
and for that,
i have no answer.

26:54.210 --> 26:55.677
[tires screeching]

26:55.711 --> 26:58.480
ah. they're bringing in
the gambrelli woman.

27:09.191 --> 27:10.959
sit down,
miss gambrelli.

28:16.192 --> 28:18.092
sit down,
miss gambrelli.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.904
now, where were--

28:31.207 --> 28:32.907
good morning, monsieur.

28:35.211 --> 28:36.477
oh.

28:36.512 --> 28:38.079
good morning,
miss gambrelli.

28:38.113 --> 28:39.113
morning.

28:39.148 --> 28:41.115
you slept well?

28:41.150 --> 28:42.584
no.

28:42.618 --> 28:44.118
wonderful.

28:44.153 --> 28:46.621
it is not easy
to sleep in prison.

28:46.655 --> 28:48.156
it isn't?

28:48.190 --> 28:50.158
no, no, no.
of course it isn't.

28:50.192 --> 28:51.960
we shall have to do
something about that,

28:51.994 --> 28:53.127
won't we?

28:53.162 --> 28:54.128
mm-hmm.

28:54.163 --> 28:55.129
oh.

28:55.164 --> 28:56.631
eh...

28:56.665 --> 28:58.099
uh...

28:59.134 --> 29:01.102
[chuckles]

29:01.136 --> 29:02.604
stupid box.

29:02.638 --> 29:03.605
yes.

29:03.639 --> 29:05.173
but, uh, anyway,

29:05.207 --> 29:07.709
first a few
simple questions.

29:07.743 --> 29:09.143
mmm.

29:09.178 --> 29:11.679
is it all right
if i smoke?

29:11.714 --> 29:13.648
oh, yes. of course.
yes, yes.

29:13.682 --> 29:15.116
have one of mine.

29:15.150 --> 29:16.651
thank you.

29:16.685 --> 29:18.119
uh...

29:18.153 --> 29:20.088
well, have one of mine.

29:20.122 --> 29:21.089
mmm?

29:21.123 --> 29:22.624
oh, thank you.

29:22.658 --> 29:24.158
very kind of you.

29:24.193 --> 29:25.627
very, very kind
of you.

29:25.661 --> 29:26.928
that's all right.

29:26.962 --> 29:28.062
allow me.

29:29.598 --> 29:30.598
thank you.

29:30.633 --> 29:32.133
other, uh,
other way around.

29:32.167 --> 29:33.668
what? oh! ha.

29:33.702 --> 29:36.137
tastes very bad
when you do that.

29:36.171 --> 29:37.071
oh.

29:38.107 --> 29:39.741
well, now...

29:41.610 --> 29:43.144
are you comfortable?

29:43.178 --> 29:46.114
they should have chairs
like this in prison.

29:46.148 --> 29:47.081
yes, yes.

29:47.116 --> 29:48.616
most certainly
they should.

29:48.651 --> 29:50.585
as i recall, the furniture
is deplorable,

29:50.619 --> 29:51.953
extremely bad taste.

29:51.987 --> 29:53.154
it's terrible.

29:53.188 --> 29:54.522
one might as well
sit on the floor.

29:54.556 --> 29:56.157
yes, it's really
high time

29:56.191 --> 29:58.159
that somebody did something
about it, don't you think?

29:58.193 --> 29:59.093
sure.

29:59.128 --> 30:00.962
as a matter of fact,

30:00.996 --> 30:03.131
i will do something
about it this very moment.

30:03.165 --> 30:05.600
uh, give me the prison
superintendent immediately.

30:05.634 --> 30:07.101
man: yes, sir.

30:07.136 --> 30:08.569
you know, sometimes
it's necessary

30:08.604 --> 30:10.071
to cut through
the red tape

30:10.105 --> 30:12.740
and strike directly at
the heart of the matter.

30:12.775 --> 30:14.142
prison is bad enough

30:14.176 --> 30:15.943
without uncomfortable
furniture.

30:15.978 --> 30:17.912
[telephone ringing]

30:19.048 --> 30:21.149
yes.

30:21.183 --> 30:23.618
superintendent,
this is inspector clouseau.

30:23.652 --> 30:25.820
when are you going
to do something

30:25.854 --> 30:28.156
about that terrible furniture
in your prison? hmm?

30:28.190 --> 30:30.124
well, we are not savages.

30:30.159 --> 30:32.093
this is not
the middle ages.

30:32.127 --> 30:34.095
i mean, you're running
a house of correction,

30:34.129 --> 30:35.596
not a torture chamber.

30:35.631 --> 30:37.065
that made him think.

30:37.099 --> 30:39.167
well, i suggest
that you take the matter

30:39.201 --> 30:40.735
under serious
consideration.

30:40.769 --> 30:43.137
i mean, if one is to cope
with the modern criminal,

30:43.172 --> 30:45.640
it is necessary
to use modern methods.

30:45.674 --> 30:48.176
i mean, you can't have
a contemporary prison

30:48.210 --> 30:50.645
without, uh,
contemporary furniture.

30:50.679 --> 30:52.113
mmm.

30:52.147 --> 30:54.615
yes, well,
that's my opinion, anyway.

30:56.418 --> 30:59.620
oh, and the same to you,
superintendent.

31:00.723 --> 31:02.623
filthy swine.

31:02.658 --> 31:04.826
you're not at all
like a policeman.

31:06.562 --> 31:08.296
your dossier.

31:10.165 --> 31:12.166
i, uh...

31:12.201 --> 31:14.168
always keep
my important documents

31:14.203 --> 31:15.670
under lock and key,

31:15.704 --> 31:18.139
because one can never
be too sure.

31:19.675 --> 31:21.042
now, here...

31:21.076 --> 31:22.443
[ripping]

31:23.545 --> 31:24.612
oh.

31:25.848 --> 31:27.448
oh, uh...

31:27.483 --> 31:29.183
excuse me.

31:29.218 --> 31:30.785
stupid of me.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.794
[chain rattles
down pant leg]

31:39.828 --> 31:41.462
oh-ho. oh.

31:44.533 --> 31:46.134
ahem.

31:46.168 --> 31:48.636
now, um...

31:50.706 --> 31:52.173
miss gambrelli,

31:52.207 --> 31:55.643
your, uh, dossier
contains some...

31:55.677 --> 31:58.179
very, very
interesting facts.

31:58.213 --> 32:01.149
it seems that you have
know this miquel osto

32:01.183 --> 32:03.050
for quite some time.

32:03.085 --> 32:04.118
yes.

32:04.153 --> 32:05.520
and were you in love
with him?

32:05.554 --> 32:06.988
yes.

32:07.022 --> 32:09.056
you're in love with
the man that raped you?

32:10.159 --> 32:11.526
that what?

32:12.828 --> 32:15.563
testimony of georges duval--
gardener.

32:15.597 --> 32:17.398
referring to osto,
you described him,

32:17.433 --> 32:18.666
and i quote,

32:18.700 --> 32:20.168
"as that crazy spaniard

32:20.202 --> 32:22.437
who raped me
in my father's field."

32:22.471 --> 32:24.472
he did not rape me.

32:25.841 --> 32:27.308
he did not force you?

32:27.342 --> 32:30.311
well, you see,
i tripped over a root,

32:30.345 --> 32:33.881
and i grabbed miquel
to keep me from falling.

32:33.916 --> 32:35.817
and somehow
we both fell.

32:37.119 --> 32:38.186
mmm.

32:38.220 --> 32:40.154
i cried a little bit
afterwards,

32:40.189 --> 32:42.990
but that wasn't because
i was sorry it happened.

32:43.025 --> 32:45.159
it was something
he said.

32:45.194 --> 32:47.028
he insulted you?

32:47.062 --> 32:48.129
oh, no.

32:48.163 --> 32:49.597
he lit a cigarette

32:49.631 --> 32:52.099
and took a long puff
and...

32:52.134 --> 32:53.634
tell me,

32:53.669 --> 32:56.337
why do so many men
smoke afterwards?

32:56.371 --> 32:58.840
no wonder tobacco
companies get rich.

33:00.843 --> 33:01.809
hmm.

33:01.844 --> 33:03.377
yes, i must admit,

33:03.412 --> 33:05.913
i'd never thought of it
quite that way.

33:05.948 --> 33:07.215
mmm.

33:07.249 --> 33:09.617
last night it was to be
our last night.

33:09.651 --> 33:11.185
it was all finished.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.720
you were leaving him?

33:12.754 --> 33:13.688
oh, no!

33:13.722 --> 33:15.122
he was leaving me.

33:15.157 --> 33:16.491
poor miquel.

33:16.525 --> 33:19.193
he was really in one
of his moods last night.

33:19.228 --> 33:21.195
first he babbled
in spanish,

33:21.230 --> 33:23.231
and then he cried.

33:23.265 --> 33:25.666
you know, he really
broke down and cried.

33:25.701 --> 33:27.001
you don't say?

33:27.035 --> 33:28.536
i do say.

33:28.570 --> 33:30.037
and then when i
tried to console him,

33:30.072 --> 33:31.272
make him feel better,

33:31.306 --> 33:33.307
suddenly he was
tearing off my clothes

33:33.342 --> 33:34.809
and cursing
like a madman.

33:35.844 --> 33:37.178
hmm.

33:37.212 --> 33:38.746
[tapping table]

33:38.780 --> 33:41.182
very strange.

33:41.216 --> 33:43.150
very strange.

33:44.419 --> 33:46.354
one thing
i don't understand.

33:46.388 --> 33:49.156
osto was leaving you...

33:49.191 --> 33:51.659
and yet by your own
account,

33:51.693 --> 33:54.128
he was behaving
like a jealous madman.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.731
well, see...

33:56.765 --> 33:59.166
i thought
if he was leaving me,

33:59.201 --> 34:01.168
he'd suffer...

34:01.203 --> 34:03.671
thinking
that i was alone.

34:03.705 --> 34:05.072
and...

34:05.107 --> 34:08.175
and so i told him
there was someone else.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.677
[quivering]
mmm.

34:09.710 --> 34:12.146
i was a lie.
i admit that.

34:12.179 --> 34:14.148
but only out of kindness!

34:14.181 --> 34:15.650
ah! oh.

34:15.684 --> 34:17.018
oh, uh...

34:17.052 --> 34:18.452
i--i'm sorry.

34:18.487 --> 34:19.987
it's nothing at all.

34:20.022 --> 34:21.088
stupid tailor.

34:21.123 --> 34:22.123
beautiful suit.

34:22.157 --> 34:24.158
yes, i know,
but don't worry.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.827
a few stitches,
and you'll never know.

34:26.862 --> 34:28.195
miquel.

34:28.230 --> 34:29.130
ah.

34:29.164 --> 34:30.630
hercule!

34:33.168 --> 34:35.636
must i go back
to prison?

34:37.371 --> 34:39.139
unfortunately, yes.

34:39.174 --> 34:41.175
but, uh...

34:41.208 --> 34:42.643
don't give up hope.

34:43.712 --> 34:45.146
what do you want?

34:45.179 --> 34:46.714
you sent for me.

34:46.748 --> 34:48.649
of course
i sent for you!

34:48.684 --> 34:49.650
[sniffles]

34:49.685 --> 34:51.719
goodbye.

34:51.753 --> 34:54.288
goodbye, my dar--
uh, miss gambrelli.

35:13.709 --> 35:15.810
well, there's no doubt
in my mind.

35:15.844 --> 35:17.612
she's shielding someone.

35:17.646 --> 35:20.014
do you think you can
break her down?

35:20.048 --> 35:21.449
mmm. given enough time,

35:21.483 --> 35:24.151
i could have her
eating out of my hand.

35:24.186 --> 35:25.620
[chuckles]

35:25.654 --> 35:28.155
yes, anyway,
we have no time.

35:28.190 --> 35:29.624
i must catch this man

35:29.658 --> 35:31.192
before he leaves
the country.

35:31.226 --> 35:33.160
but if you don't know
who he is...

35:33.195 --> 35:35.396
she will lead me to him.
release her.

35:35.430 --> 35:36.597
release her?

35:36.632 --> 35:38.666
of course! how can
she lead me to him

35:38.700 --> 35:40.668
if she's still in prison,
you idiot?!

35:40.702 --> 35:42.136
but
commissioner dreyfus.

35:42.170 --> 35:44.138
i will assume
complete responsibility.

35:44.172 --> 35:45.640
release her immediately!

35:45.674 --> 35:47.642
i will apprehend this
culprit within 24 hours.

35:47.676 --> 35:48.943
aah!

35:50.178 --> 35:51.979
get me out of here.

35:52.014 --> 35:53.447
quick or i shall scream.

35:57.786 --> 35:59.220
ahh.

35:59.254 --> 36:01.622
look, i've got africa
all over my hand now.

36:20.008 --> 36:21.442
nice balloons.

36:25.047 --> 36:27.281
you have a license
to sell these balloons?

36:29.151 --> 36:30.117
license?

36:31.353 --> 36:33.287
[siren]

37:11.526 --> 37:12.526
yes?

37:12.561 --> 37:13.794
good morning,
monsieur.

37:13.829 --> 37:15.162
good morning, georges.

37:15.197 --> 37:16.997
is there something
i can do for you?

37:17.032 --> 37:18.532
why, yes.

37:18.567 --> 37:19.867
and perhaps there
is something

37:19.901 --> 37:21.435
i can do for you.

37:21.470 --> 37:24.638
what could you possibly
do for me?

37:24.673 --> 37:27.475
you remember the night
of the murder?

37:27.509 --> 37:29.477
is that a rhetorical
question?

37:29.511 --> 37:30.845
what?

37:30.879 --> 37:32.880
now, come along, georges,
what is it you want?

37:34.382 --> 37:37.651
i saw you climbing down
from maria's room.

37:39.187 --> 37:41.088
you have sharp eyes.

37:41.123 --> 37:42.123
oh, yes.

37:42.157 --> 37:43.657
and a big stomach.

37:43.692 --> 37:46.093
so hard to keep it
filled.

37:47.562 --> 37:49.497
are we going to discuss
the national economy,

37:49.531 --> 37:51.465
or will you presently
come to the point?

37:51.500 --> 37:54.135
the point
is 100,000 francs.

37:54.169 --> 37:56.470
you know,
for the groceries.

37:57.839 --> 38:01.275
then perhaps my eyes
will grow small again.

38:01.309 --> 38:03.677
yes, well...

38:03.712 --> 38:06.981
we'll certainly have to do
something about your stomach.

38:31.173 --> 38:32.173

oh, excuse me.

i just happened
to be passing and i...

ah...

ah...

ah, my--

ah...

39:01.236 --> 39:02.770
oh, you have been
cutting flowers.

39:02.804 --> 39:04.171
ah...

39:04.206 --> 39:06.140
well, you must've been
cutting something.

39:06.174 --> 39:08.142
there's blood all over
your cutting shears.

39:08.176 --> 39:09.109
ahh...ah...

39:09.144 --> 39:10.644
that's very strange.

[terrified moaning]

39:13.882 --> 39:15.783
[clouseau joins
in moaning]

39:17.552 --> 39:19.153
facts, hercule.

39:19.187 --> 39:20.621
facts.

39:20.655 --> 39:22.223
behind them,

39:22.257 --> 39:24.792
lies the whole fabric
of deductive truth.

39:26.194 --> 39:28.963
now, hercule, let us
examine these facts.

39:28.997 --> 39:30.197
one!

39:30.232 --> 39:31.632
she was found

39:31.666 --> 39:33.400
with the murder weapon
in her hand.

39:33.435 --> 39:34.735
two!

39:34.769 --> 39:37.104
the murder weapon
was fresh with blood.

39:37.138 --> 39:38.472
three!

39:38.506 --> 39:40.507
there were no fingerprints
on the murder weapon

39:40.542 --> 39:41.809
other than hers.

39:41.843 --> 39:43.143
and four!

39:43.178 --> 39:45.646
all the members of
the ballon household staff

39:45.680 --> 39:47.147
have perfect alibis.

39:47.182 --> 39:49.516
now then, hercule...

39:49.551 --> 39:52.152
what do these facts
add up to?

39:52.187 --> 39:55.155
maria gambrelli killed
georges the gardener.

39:55.190 --> 39:57.124
you are an idiot.

39:57.158 --> 39:58.659
only a fresh-faced
novice

39:58.693 --> 40:01.161
would come up with
a conclusion like that!

40:01.196 --> 40:02.696
but the facts--

40:02.731 --> 40:04.164
listen,
whoever killed miquel,

40:04.199 --> 40:05.666
killed georges
the gardener.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.668
and he did it to cover up
the first crime.

40:07.702 --> 40:09.670
now what he is trying
to do is lay the blame

40:09.704 --> 40:11.639
at the foot of this
poor servant girl.

40:11.673 --> 40:13.307
well, who do you
suspect?

40:14.843 --> 40:17.177
i suspect...

40:17.212 --> 40:18.712
everyone.

40:18.747 --> 40:20.681
well, i suppose
that is possible.

40:20.715 --> 40:21.682
possible?

40:21.716 --> 40:23.651
what do you mean
"possible"?

40:23.685 --> 40:25.219
i deal in certainties.

40:25.253 --> 40:27.254
i have only to break
her down,

40:27.289 --> 40:29.657
make her <i>admit</i>
she's protecting somebody,

40:29.691 --> 40:32.293
and then <i>force</i> her
to divulge his identity!

40:32.327 --> 40:33.794

40:37.799 --> 40:39.633
no more subtle
interrogation.

40:39.668 --> 40:40.968
ohh.

40:42.037 --> 40:43.470
for her own sake,

40:43.505 --> 40:45.973
and for the sake
of justice,

40:46.007 --> 40:49.843
i will resort to any means
short of brute force

40:49.878 --> 40:52.279
to drag it out of her,
hercules!

40:52.314 --> 40:54.315
true, she will suffer.

40:54.349 --> 40:56.183
but in the end,

40:56.217 --> 40:57.651
she will be free,

40:57.686 --> 40:59.987
and we will have
our killer.

41:01.222 --> 41:03.190
he released her again?!

41:03.224 --> 41:04.158
yes, sir.

41:41.229 --> 41:43.163
well, shall we settle
this thing now,

41:43.198 --> 41:45.632
or do you intend making
me late for the recital?

41:46.835 --> 41:48.869
look, we can't
just fire her.

41:48.903 --> 41:50.471
she's given us
no cause.

41:51.706 --> 41:53.173
we are up to our necks
in dead bodies!

for,

41:54.709 --> 41:56.443

41:56.478 --> 41:58.846
if you're going to compare
the ballon household

41:58.880 --> 42:00.714
with a shakespearean
tragedy,

42:00.749 --> 42:03.650
i suggest that <i>macbeth</i>
would be more appropriate.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.261
good evening, inspector.

42:47.295 --> 42:48.629
if you don't mind,

42:48.663 --> 42:49.763
there are
one or two questions

42:49.798 --> 42:50.998
i would like to ask.

42:51.032 --> 42:52.166
of course.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.767
some points that need
clearing up.

42:53.802 --> 42:54.968
certainly.

42:55.003 --> 42:56.670
you play billiards
by any chance?

42:56.704 --> 42:57.905
well, yes i have
played some billiards

42:57.939 --> 42:59.139
in my time.

42:59.174 --> 43:00.641
i find that it makes

43:00.675 --> 43:02.176
for a more relaxed
and friendly conversation.

43:02.210 --> 43:03.677
how about you?

43:03.711 --> 43:04.678
yes, yes.

43:04.712 --> 43:06.180
take a cue.

43:06.214 --> 43:07.648
ah, a cue. yes.

43:08.716 --> 43:09.716
hmm.

43:09.751 --> 43:11.318
that will do.

43:17.258 --> 43:18.692
very strange.

43:18.726 --> 43:20.127
well, i think
you'd be better off

43:20.161 --> 43:21.695
with an ordinary cue.

43:21.729 --> 43:23.630
that's what we call
a bridge.

43:23.665 --> 43:25.132
the bridge cue. yes.

43:25.166 --> 43:26.667
yes, i much prefer

43:28.203 --> 43:29.369
yes, yes.

43:30.505 --> 43:32.473
let's see.
ah. this will do.

43:34.175 --> 43:35.642
oh! i am...

43:35.677 --> 43:37.211
most terribly sorry.

43:37.245 --> 43:39.146

sorry. i...

43:42.717 --> 43:44.151
uh, try this one.

43:44.185 --> 43:45.819
this is my favorite cue.

43:48.590 --> 43:51.158
you'll find that it's
great for curved shots.

44:06.908 --> 44:09.643
you, uh, had some
questions, inspector?

44:09.677 --> 44:11.178

you just missed her.

44:18.186 --> 44:19.786
on the contrary,

44:19.821 --> 44:22.289
she just missed me in

44:33.168 --> 44:35.135
did you not state...

44:37.372 --> 44:38.639
that, uh...

44:39.707 --> 44:41.842
on the night
of the murder

44:41.876 --> 44:43.810
you had, uh...

44:43.845 --> 44:45.612
just arrived
from london

44:45.647 --> 44:47.781
on the 11:00 flight?

44:49.150 --> 44:51.018
yes. why do you ask?

44:51.052 --> 44:54.321
it was canceled
due to bad weather.

44:54.355 --> 44:55.722
[balls clack]

44:55.757 --> 44:57.858
i arrived
on an earlier flight.

44:57.892 --> 45:00.561
i put it to you directly,
monsieur ballon,

45:00.595 --> 45:03.664
that it was you
who murdered miquel osto.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.634
don't be ridiculous.

45:08.903 --> 45:11.138

45:11.172 --> 45:13.273
look, if you can
just move...

45:13.308 --> 45:14.541
that's it.

45:14.576 --> 45:17.177
these curved cues
can be difficult.

45:17.212 --> 45:18.812
all right. pull.

45:21.549 --> 45:22.683
ah.

45:22.717 --> 45:24.651
yes, i disliked miquel
intensely.

45:24.686 --> 45:26.687
but i'm not in the habit
of killing people

45:26.721 --> 45:28.155
merely because
i dislike them.

45:28.189 --> 45:29.122
aha!

45:29.157 --> 45:30.624
oh, i beg your pardon.

45:31.926 --> 45:32.926
as long as you

45:32.961 --> 45:34.127
know about
the canceled flight,

i may as well tell you
the whole thing.

45:36.331 --> 45:38.465
the night that miquel
was killed,

45:38.499 --> 45:41.134
i arranged for him
to meet the 11:00 plane.

45:41.169 --> 45:43.170
i arrived on the 9:00.

45:43.204 --> 45:45.706
now, he would be on
his way to the airport

45:45.740 --> 45:47.708
while i was
on my way home.

45:47.742 --> 45:49.676
my wife was
at a dinner party.

45:49.711 --> 45:53.180
this would give me
a whole hour, at least,

for her?

53:01.709 --> 53:03.209
you say you followed
maria gambrelli

53:03.244 --> 53:04.711
to this
god-forsaken place?

53:04.745 --> 53:06.646
she took a taxi
this far,

53:06.681 --> 53:08.682
then i followed her
up the pathway

53:08.716 --> 53:10.650
to the entrance
to camp sunshine.

53:10.685 --> 53:12.218
camp sunshine?

53:12.253 --> 53:13.653
yes. i would have
called you,

53:13.688 --> 53:15.355

53:16.691 --> 53:17.891
up the path, you say?

53:17.925 --> 53:19.192
yes, but inspector--

53:19.226 --> 53:21.161
look, you return
to the ballon residence

53:21.195 --> 53:22.729
and look for more clues.

53:22.763 --> 53:24.464
i will try to see
what is afoot

53:24.498 --> 53:25.965
at this camp sunshine.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.067
inspector, i think--

53:27.101 --> 53:28.134
hurry up, man.

53:28.169 --> 53:29.803
there's not a second
to lose.

53:56.163 --> 53:58.164

54:16.217 --> 54:18.318
"gambrelli--11:45."

54:19.386 --> 54:20.820
where can i find her?

54:20.855 --> 54:23.189
well, she could be
most anywhere,

54:23.224 --> 54:25.492

thank you.

54:32.700 --> 54:34.134
can i ask you

of the french government.

55:45.206 --> 55:46.272

55:47.708 --> 55:48.975

55:49.944 --> 55:51.344

believe me,

01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:30.183
it's nothing to what
would've happened

01:01:30.217 --> 01:01:31.284
if they'd caught us.

01:01:31.318 --> 01:01:32.518

you keep down, and...

01:01:35.455 --> 01:01:36.956
then they can only see
the top half of me.

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:38.357
perhaps they will think

01:01:38.392 --> 01:01:39.525
that i have just come
from the beach,

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.960
from a swim, you know,
and--

01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:42.695
we can't just keep
driving around.

i can assure you,

01:01:59.346 --> 01:02:00.780
she's not
in the house.

01:02:00.814 --> 01:02:02.281
i'm very sorry,
monsieur ballon,

01:02:02.316 --> 01:02:04.317
but it is necessary
that i see for myself.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:14.060
she has not been
in the house all day?

01:02:14.094 --> 01:02:15.595
all i can tell you is

01:02:15.629 --> 01:02:17.263
that she left before
i did this morning,

01:02:17.297 --> 01:02:19.765
and she wasn't here when
i got back an hour ago.

01:02:21.835 --> 01:02:24.403

to leave?

you are making
a terrible mistake.

is not a murderer,

01:04:56.256 --> 01:04:57.623

uh, influential parties

01:05:31.758 --> 01:05:34.960
that wanted clouseau
on the case?

whatever they do
to me now,

01:05:37.164 --> 01:05:40.866
it is not half of what
he has done already.

ahh...

01:05:43.236 --> 01:05:44.870
besides,

01:05:44.905 --> 01:05:46.439
i feel certain i know

01:05:46.473 --> 01:05:48.908
who is behind those
influential requests.

01:05:52.345 --> 01:05:54.280
it is obvious
he was having an affair

01:05:54.314 --> 01:05:55.815
with maria gambrelli.

01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:57.450
most likely.

01:05:57.484 --> 01:05:59.452
at first i couldn't
understand

01:05:59.486 --> 01:06:02.254
why anyone would want
a man like clouseau

01:06:02.289 --> 01:06:03.456
to be in charge
of a murder case,

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:05.324
especially a case
of this importance.

01:06:05.358 --> 01:06:07.159
but why would ballon?

01:06:07.194 --> 01:06:08.928
ah, he wouldn't...

01:06:08.962 --> 01:06:11.230
unless he was
protecting someone.

01:06:11.264 --> 01:06:13.432
now, if you
were protecting someone,

01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:16.035
who would be the perfect
man on the case?

01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:17.536
a fool.

01:06:17.571 --> 01:06:20.139
a detective who is a
complete and utter fool.

01:06:20.173 --> 01:06:21.140
clouseau.

01:06:21.174 --> 01:06:22.274
of course.

01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:23.809
if maria gambrelli
is convicted,

01:06:23.844 --> 01:06:25.611
ballon is
up to his ears

01:06:25.645 --> 01:06:27.046
in a very nasty
scandal,

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.348
and clouseau was his
insurance policy

01:06:29.382 --> 01:06:31.617
against
such a scandal.

01:06:37.858 --> 01:06:40.226
i feel
like a child again.

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.596
hmm...it's
an interesting theory,

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:45.097
but what
if you are wrong?

01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:49.001
i know it's an extremely
remote possibility,

01:06:49.035 --> 01:06:50.903
but what
if you are wrong,

01:06:50.937 --> 01:06:53.272
and ballon is not
protecting maria gambrelli?

01:06:53.306 --> 01:06:54.507
what if she's innocent,

01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:55.875
as clouseau claims?

01:06:55.909 --> 01:06:57.009
what?

01:06:57.043 --> 01:06:58.043

01:06:58.078 --> 01:06:59.578
but a possibility.

01:06:59.613 --> 01:07:02.081
what if ballon is
protecting someone else?

01:07:02.115 --> 01:07:04.517
or, what if
ballon <i>himself</i>

01:07:04.551 --> 01:07:06.218
is the guilty party?

01:07:06.253 --> 01:07:08.120
that's a sadistic thing
to suggest.

01:07:08.154 --> 01:07:09.989

the sake of discussion,

01:07:10.023 --> 01:07:12.358

is protecting her lover,

and the best way to
force him into the open

01:10:52.145 --> 01:10:53.612
is to make him jealous.

01:21:18.838 --> 01:21:19.804
[crash]

01:21:19.839 --> 01:21:20.805
oh...

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.940
oh, but jacques--

01:21:21.974 --> 01:21:23.408
oh, darling, oh...

01:21:23.442 --> 01:21:24.609
whoo!

01:21:24.643 --> 01:21:26.277
oh...oh...

01:21:26.312 --> 01:21:27.312
ha ha!

01:21:27.346 --> 01:21:28.613
oh...

01:21:28.647 --> 01:21:29.581
my darling,

01:21:29.615 --> 01:21:32.484
my dear [kiss]
sweet darling.

01:21:35.654 --> 01:21:37.489
my sweetheart...
please help me--

01:21:41.127 --> 01:21:42.427
[buzzer]

01:21:42.461 --> 01:21:43.762
jacques?
what, darling?

01:21:43.796 --> 01:21:45.563
it may be somebody
important, jacques.

01:21:45.598 --> 01:21:46.898
oh, darling, listen,

01:21:46.932 --> 01:21:48.466
what could be more
important than this?

01:21:48.501 --> 01:21:49.667
jacques, look
what you're doing.

01:21:49.702 --> 01:21:50.969
you're just--
look at my sleeve!

01:21:51.003 --> 01:21:52.237
it's all right,
darling--

01:21:52.271 --> 01:21:53.738
jacques,
go to the door!

01:21:53.773 --> 01:21:55.206
it looks better
that way--

01:21:55.241 --> 01:21:56.741
probably--
don't go away.

01:21:56.776 --> 01:21:57.742
somebody important.

01:21:57.777 --> 01:21:59.144
yeah. [kiss]
don't go away.

01:21:59.178 --> 01:22:00.378
darling?
what?

01:22:00.413 --> 01:22:01.446
h-hurry.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:02.447
hurry! ah, yes!

01:22:33.913 --> 01:22:35.346
[ticking]

01:22:36.415 --> 01:22:38.349
maria: darling.

01:22:38.384 --> 01:22:41.753
uh, coming, my lovely
little darling.

01:22:41.787 --> 01:22:43.521
that's very strange.

01:22:51.297 --> 01:22:54.032
darling.

01:22:54.066 --> 01:22:55.533
oh, my darling.

01:22:55.568 --> 01:22:56.534
come on.

01:22:59.038 --> 01:23:00.371
oh!

01:23:00.406 --> 01:23:04.442
oh, this is too much
for a simple policeman.

01:23:04.477 --> 01:23:05.443
come on.

01:23:05.478 --> 01:23:06.811
[gargling]

01:23:06.846 --> 01:23:09.047
oh, my darling...

01:23:09.081 --> 01:23:11.115
oh, wait, i...

01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:12.717
yeah, this is
the way to do it.

01:23:12.751 --> 01:23:16.855
wait,
my darling, wait...

01:23:16.889 --> 01:23:20.425
now...of course...
you...torment...oh!

01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:22.427
you beautiful...
you wonderful...

01:23:22.461 --> 01:23:23.862
wait a minute...

01:23:23.896 --> 01:23:25.897
like a...
a little pincushion!

01:23:25.931 --> 01:23:26.998
ha ha!
ha ha!

01:23:27.032 --> 01:23:27.999
oh, boy...

01:23:28.033 --> 01:23:29.501
i cannot find...

01:23:29.535 --> 01:23:30.502
my beautiful--

01:23:30.536 --> 01:23:31.536
i don't--

01:23:33.706 --> 01:23:34.639
hyaah!

01:23:34.673 --> 01:23:35.673
aah! stop!

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:36.841
aah!
what--

01:23:36.876 --> 01:23:37.842
aah!

01:23:37.877 --> 01:23:38.910
what is this--

01:23:38.944 --> 01:23:39.878
kato: <i>banzai!</i>

01:23:39.912 --> 01:23:40.879
help! help!

01:23:40.946 --> 01:23:41.880
kato, are you mad?

01:23:41.914 --> 01:23:43.414
what are you doing?

01:23:43.449 --> 01:23:44.649
kato!

01:23:44.683 --> 01:23:46.050
aah!

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:48.987
kato!

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.101
aah!

01:24:03.135 --> 01:24:04.636
jacques!

01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:06.404
don't worry,
my darling, it's kato.

01:24:06.438 --> 01:24:08.206
it's only kato.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.774
poor fool.

01:24:09.808 --> 01:24:11.309
[kato choking]

01:24:33.499 --> 01:24:36.634
[sobbing]
jacques! oh, jacques!

01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:38.036
i killed him.

01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:39.170
maria, you didn't.

01:24:39.204 --> 01:24:40.138
he's all right,
my darling.

01:24:40.172 --> 01:24:41.539
it's nothing
to worry--

01:24:41.574 --> 01:24:42.707
nothing can
happen to us now.

01:24:42.741 --> 01:24:44.442
nothing can
disturb us.

01:24:44.476 --> 01:24:47.011
[bong bong bong]

01:24:54.553 --> 01:24:58.056
"trail of death follows
inspector clouseau."

01:25:01.627 --> 01:25:02.794
4 people...

01:25:02.828 --> 01:25:07.165
a doorman, 2 customers,
and a cossack.

01:25:07.199 --> 01:25:09.934
most regrettable.

01:25:09.969 --> 01:25:12.370
regrettable?

01:25:12.404 --> 01:25:13.705
including
the ballon murders,

01:25:13.739 --> 01:25:15.406
this brings
the grand total to 8!

01:25:15.441 --> 01:25:17.609
well, that
just goes to prove

01:25:17.643 --> 01:25:19.644
what i have said
all along.

01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:24.449
what you've said
all along, clouseau,

01:25:24.483 --> 01:25:26.451
qualifies you as
the greatest prophet

01:25:26.485 --> 01:25:27.885
since
general custer said

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.021
he was going to surround
all those indians!

01:25:30.055 --> 01:25:32.190
maria gambrelli did
not kill those 4 people.

01:25:32.224 --> 01:25:33.491
which 4 people?

01:25:33.525 --> 01:25:34.826
the last 4 people.

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.461
someone else killed
those 4 people.

01:25:36.495 --> 01:25:38.096
i was with her
all the time.

01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:39.998
and whoever he is,
he is the same man

01:25:40.032 --> 01:25:41.499
who killed
the first 4 people.

01:25:41.533 --> 01:25:42.767
a doorman? a cossack?

01:25:42.801 --> 01:25:44.135
yes,
innocent bystanders.

01:25:44.169 --> 01:25:45.670
the murderer
was after me.

01:25:45.704 --> 01:25:46.971
fortunately
he missed.

01:25:47.006 --> 01:25:48.806
fortunately
is not the word.

01:25:48.841 --> 01:25:49.974
nevertheless,

01:25:50.009 --> 01:25:51.743
it proves that
my theory is correct.

01:25:51.777 --> 01:25:53.344
you see, because of
some misguided loyalty,

01:25:53.379 --> 01:25:54.812
maria gambrelli will
not divulge the name

01:25:54.847 --> 01:25:55.947
of her former lover,

01:25:55.981 --> 01:25:57.215
and that man
is so jealous,

01:25:57.249 --> 01:25:58.850
he will kill rather
than lose her.

01:25:58.884 --> 01:26:00.652
are you saying
that this man,

01:26:00.686 --> 01:26:02.387
the man maria gambrelli
is protecting,

01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:03.921
her former lover,

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:06.124
killed 8 people
because he was jealous?

01:26:06.158 --> 01:26:07.358
<i>insanely</i> jealous.

01:26:07.393 --> 01:26:09.160
so jealous
he made it look

01:26:09.194 --> 01:26:10.828
like maria gambrelli
was the murderer?

01:26:10.863 --> 01:26:12.363
he's a madman,
a psychotic.

01:26:12.398 --> 01:26:13.865
what about the maid?

01:26:13.899 --> 01:26:14.866
the maid?

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.367
was he jealous
of her, too?

01:26:16.402 --> 01:26:17.702
he strangled her!

01:26:17.736 --> 01:26:18.736
it's possible that
his intended victim

01:26:18.771 --> 01:26:20.738
was a man,
and he made a mistake.

01:26:20.773 --> 01:26:22.674
a mistake?
in a nudist camp?

01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:23.675
nobody's perfect.

01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:24.642
idiot!
sir?

01:26:24.677 --> 01:26:25.710
nincompoop!
commissioner--

01:26:25.744 --> 01:26:27.311
lunatic!

01:26:27.346 --> 01:26:29.313
i will have your murderer
for you by tonight.

01:26:29.348 --> 01:26:30.314
what?

01:26:30.349 --> 01:26:32.884
i have a plan.

01:26:32.918 --> 01:26:34.585
what sort of plan?

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:38.623
a plan that cannot
possibly fail.

01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:55.773
right.
now, remember,

01:26:55.808 --> 01:26:58.943
at 8:00 sharp, you
pull the master switch

01:26:58.977 --> 01:27:01.345
just as i am about
to name the murderer.

01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.947
i leave the lights
off for 5 seconds.

01:27:02.981 --> 01:27:04.215
yes. not
a second longer.

01:27:04.249 --> 01:27:05.850
just long enough
for the murderer

01:27:05.884 --> 01:27:07.218
to leave the room.

01:27:07.252 --> 01:27:08.686
understand?
you're quite clear?

01:27:08.721 --> 01:27:10.288
right. now we
synchronize watches.

01:27:12.624 --> 01:27:14.258
in 7 seconds...

01:27:14.293 --> 01:27:15.560
it will be...

01:27:15.594 --> 01:27:17.562
precisely...

01:27:17.596 --> 01:27:19.864
2...43.

01:27:22.534 --> 01:27:24.135
2:43...

01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:25.336
your watch
must've stopped.

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.138
i have 7:46.

01:27:27.172 --> 01:27:28.172
yes...

01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:29.707
yes, 7:46, yes.

01:27:29.742 --> 01:27:30.742
no, no, no. no.

01:27:30.776 --> 01:27:32.877
now
it's nearly...7:47.

01:27:32.911 --> 01:27:34.345
yes, all right. 7:47.

01:27:34.379 --> 01:27:36.981
are we synchronizing
on 7:47?

01:27:37.015 --> 01:27:38.416
that's what you said.

01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:40.418
no, i said
it was <i>nearly...</i>

01:27:40.452 --> 01:27:43.988
now, oh...
10 seconds to 7:47.

01:27:44.022 --> 01:27:45.990
i got 10 seconds
after 7:47.

01:27:46.024 --> 01:27:47.692
well, you'll have to
put your watch back.

01:27:47.726 --> 01:27:49.093
yes, all right,
all right.

01:27:49.128 --> 01:27:50.261
5 seconds.

01:27:50.295 --> 01:27:51.229
yes.

01:27:51.263 --> 01:27:52.396
4...
4...

01:27:52.431 --> 01:27:53.397
3...

01:27:53.432 --> 01:27:54.599
2...
2...

01:27:54.633 --> 01:27:55.833
1...
1...

01:27:55.868 --> 01:27:56.834
now.

01:27:58.871 --> 01:28:00.505
strange...

01:28:00.539 --> 01:28:03.407
the second hand
is not moving.

01:28:03.442 --> 01:28:04.375
it's ticking...

01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:06.110
it's moving now.

01:28:06.145 --> 01:28:07.678
what? yes!

01:28:07.713 --> 01:28:09.180
yes, it is. yes.

01:28:09.214 --> 01:28:11.415
i knew that. i can see
that it's moving now.

01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:14.819
and now it's 7:47
and 23 seconds.

01:28:14.853 --> 01:28:17.388
all right, let's synchronize
on 7:47 and a half.

01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:18.790
oh, yes.

01:28:18.824 --> 01:28:20.124
5...
5...

01:28:20.159 --> 01:28:21.459
4...
4...

01:28:21.493 --> 01:28:22.827
3...
3...

01:28:22.861 --> 01:28:24.028
2...

01:28:24.062 --> 01:28:25.663
1...

01:28:25.697 --> 01:28:26.998
now.

01:28:27.032 --> 01:28:28.800
my watch
has stopped.

01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:29.834
your watch
has stopped?

01:28:29.868 --> 01:28:31.235
<i>oui.</i>

01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:33.070
remarkable coincidence.
stopped completely.

01:28:35.174 --> 01:28:36.607
hmm...

01:28:36.642 --> 01:28:38.276
look, uh...
take my watch.

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:40.044
but what about you?

01:28:40.078 --> 01:28:42.380
don't worry. i'll keep talking
till the lights go out.

01:28:42.414 --> 01:28:44.182
but we still won't
be synchronized.

01:28:44.216 --> 01:28:46.150
yes, it'll be all right.
don't worry.

01:28:46.185 --> 01:28:48.452
i'll find a way out,
hercule.

01:29:05.003 --> 01:29:06.637
[door opens]

01:29:13.145 --> 01:29:14.712
it's very kind of you,

01:29:14.746 --> 01:29:16.547
but there's no need
for you to stand.

01:29:16.582 --> 01:29:18.082
please sit down.

01:29:20.352 --> 01:29:21.819
now, then...

01:29:21.854 --> 01:29:23.154
i expect
you're wondering

01:29:23.188 --> 01:29:24.689
why i've asked
you all here.

01:29:24.723 --> 01:29:26.924
well, whatever the reason,
it's a damn nuisance.

01:29:26.959 --> 01:29:28.693
we usually have
dinner at 9:00,

01:29:28.727 --> 01:29:30.628
and you've brought
everything to a standstill.

01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:33.064
you will not be
inconvenienced for long,

01:29:33.098 --> 01:29:34.165
monsieur ballon.

01:29:42.841 --> 01:29:46.110
your clock has stopped,
monsieur ballon.

01:29:46.144 --> 01:29:48.112
yes, but if you want
to know the time,

01:29:48.146 --> 01:29:49.647
it's exactly 7:50.

01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:52.183
you are slow, darling.
it's 7:52.

01:29:52.217 --> 01:29:53.684
no, my love.

01:29:53.719 --> 01:29:55.686
this watch has
not lost a second

01:29:55.721 --> 01:29:57.622
since the day
you gave it to me.

01:29:57.656 --> 01:29:59.657
i didn't give it
to you.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.962
i have 7:55, monsieur.

01:30:04.997 --> 01:30:06.230
that is what i have.

01:30:06.265 --> 01:30:07.698
you're both fast.

01:30:07.733 --> 01:30:10.034
no. my watch is right.
i'll prove it to you.

01:30:15.107 --> 01:30:17.008
would you tell me
the right time, please?

01:30:18.043 --> 01:30:19.810
7:54. thank you.

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.481
[telephone rings]

01:30:23.515 --> 01:30:24.715
yes?

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:26.651
oh, it's for you,
inspector.

01:30:26.685 --> 01:30:29.220
ah, it's for me.

01:30:35.027 --> 01:30:36.160
yes?

01:30:36.194 --> 01:30:37.895
what time is it?

01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:38.863
what?

01:30:40.565 --> 01:30:42.400
your watch has stopped.

01:30:42.434 --> 01:30:44.869
where are you?

01:30:44.903 --> 01:30:46.537
i'm down in the basement.

01:30:46.571 --> 01:30:48.139
i had the operator
call this number.

01:30:48.173 --> 01:30:49.373
what do i do?

01:30:49.408 --> 01:30:50.574
i can't pull the switch
at 8:00

01:30:50.609 --> 01:30:51.876
if i don't know
what time it is.

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:54.845
it's, uh, 7:54.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.780
55 now.

01:30:55.814 --> 01:30:57.348
55 now, yes.

01:30:57.382 --> 01:30:59.350
i just realized something.

01:30:59.384 --> 01:31:01.352
i still won't know
when it's 8:00.

01:31:01.386 --> 01:31:02.887
count.

01:31:02.921 --> 01:31:03.988
what?

01:31:04.022 --> 01:31:05.957
count.

01:31:05.991 --> 01:31:08.092
oh, count.

01:31:08.126 --> 01:31:09.393
you mean seconds?

01:31:09.428 --> 01:31:11.529
yes, that is
exactly what i mean.

01:31:11.563 --> 01:31:13.431
and don't dare
call me here again.

01:31:16.735 --> 01:31:17.835
now, then.

01:31:39.858 --> 01:31:42.560
now, then,
i will tell you...

01:31:43.929 --> 01:31:47.264
why i've called you
all here tonight.

01:31:47.299 --> 01:31:49.033
one of you...

01:31:50.535 --> 01:31:52.136
is a murderer.

01:32:00.445 --> 01:32:02.213
36,

01:32:02.247 --> 01:32:03.714
37,

01:32:03.749 --> 01:32:05.082
38,

01:32:05.117 --> 01:32:06.017
39...

01:32:06.051 --> 01:32:09.286
before i
name the killer...

01:32:11.089 --> 01:32:13.457
i will explain to you
the facts

01:32:13.492 --> 01:32:20.398
that led me to discover
his...or her identity.

01:32:37.349 --> 01:32:38.749
now, then,

01:32:38.784 --> 01:32:39.683
the night the chauffeur--

01:32:46.591 --> 01:32:48.059
the night the chauffeur
was killed--

01:32:48.093 --> 01:32:49.360
what was
the chauffeur's name?

01:32:49.394 --> 01:32:50.394
miquel.

01:32:50.429 --> 01:32:51.362
no, miquel.
migwell, yes.

01:32:51.396 --> 01:32:53.164
migwell.
miquel.

01:32:53.198 --> 01:32:55.366
well, this italian--

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.667
no, he was
a spaniard.

01:32:58.403 --> 01:33:01.772
well, this spaniard,
um, mengwell,

01:33:01.807 --> 01:33:03.741
he was furious
with maria gambrelli.

01:33:03.775 --> 01:33:05.543
he tore her dress off.

01:33:05.577 --> 01:33:07.411
he protested violently
and then--

01:33:07.446 --> 01:33:09.480
aah!
oh, my foot!

01:33:09.514 --> 01:33:11.982
i'm terribly sorry.
i beg your pardon.

01:33:12.017 --> 01:33:13.884
i did not notice.
excuse me.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.554
he tore her dress off,

01:33:16.588 --> 01:33:19.023
and at that precise moment,

01:33:19.057 --> 01:33:20.958
the door opened,

01:33:20.992 --> 01:33:24.695
and somebody--
somebody shot him.

01:33:24.729 --> 01:33:27.498
now, maria could not see
who the killer was

01:33:27.532 --> 01:33:28.899
because she was
unconscious.

01:33:28.934 --> 01:33:31.035
and the reason that
she was unconscious

01:33:31.069 --> 01:33:33.104
was that she had received
a bemp upon the head.

01:33:33.138 --> 01:33:34.105
a what?

01:33:35.373 --> 01:33:36.807
a bemp.

01:33:36.842 --> 01:33:39.510
now, there is
only one way

01:33:39.544 --> 01:33:41.712
she could have received
a bemp like that.

01:33:41.746 --> 01:33:44.315
she was hit upon the head
by an object,

01:33:44.349 --> 01:33:47.685
and the object was the knob
on the closet door.

01:33:47.719 --> 01:33:50.554
somebody was hiding
in that closet,

01:33:50.589 --> 01:33:52.923
and when they
opened the door,

01:33:52.958 --> 01:33:55.092
she received
a bemp upon the head.

01:33:55.127 --> 01:33:56.694
oh, for heaven's
sake, inspector,

01:33:56.728 --> 01:33:57.661
come to the point.

01:33:57.696 --> 01:33:59.230
don't tangle with--

01:33:59.264 --> 01:34:01.265
ow!
you clumsy idiot!

01:34:01.299 --> 01:34:02.933
sorry.
i'm terribly sorry.

01:34:02.968 --> 01:34:04.101
ohh!

01:34:04.136 --> 01:34:05.035
no, no!

01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:06.170
ohh!
ohh!

01:34:06.204 --> 01:34:08.305
[dreamily]
oh, these feathers...

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:11.442
oh, i'm coming, maria,
my darling.

01:34:11.476 --> 01:34:12.543
my darling.

01:34:15.981 --> 01:34:17.548
oh...

01:34:17.582 --> 01:34:19.583
careful, monsieur,
with me.

01:34:19.618 --> 01:34:21.519
do not tangle with me.

01:34:21.553 --> 01:34:23.521
i'm a trained expert
in karate.

01:34:23.555 --> 01:34:25.689
my hands are
lethal weapons.

01:34:28.226 --> 01:34:29.760
hmm!

01:34:31.596 --> 01:34:32.763
now, then.

01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.169
there is something that i
am very interested to know.

01:34:38.203 --> 01:34:39.470
this room,
it looks very--

01:34:39.504 --> 01:34:40.571
what happened?

01:34:40.605 --> 01:34:41.639
what?

01:34:41.673 --> 01:34:44.975
you fell off the sofa,
you stupid--

01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:46.744
i know i fell
off the sofa, madame.

01:34:46.778 --> 01:34:48.078
there's no need
to tell me.

01:34:48.113 --> 01:34:50.314
everything i do is
carefully planned, madame.

01:34:50.348 --> 01:34:52.149
i know that.

01:34:53.218 --> 01:34:56.453
now, then, uh...

01:34:57.522 --> 01:34:59.423
what was i saying?
uh...

01:35:01.293 --> 01:35:02.893
listen, you--you
daydreaming fool,

01:35:02.928 --> 01:35:04.728
what are you doing there?

01:35:04.763 --> 01:35:06.430
i mean, can't you pay
attention when i'm talking?

01:35:06.464 --> 01:35:07.631
don't you know
what i was saying?

01:35:07.666 --> 01:35:08.866
you're not listening
to me.

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:10.234
with the greatest
respect, monsieur,

01:35:10.268 --> 01:35:11.468
i heard every word
that you said.

01:35:11.503 --> 01:35:13.003
will you be kind enough

01:35:13.038 --> 01:35:14.371
to tell me what
it was that i said?

01:35:14.406 --> 01:35:16.507
you were talking about
the closet, monsieur.

01:35:16.541 --> 01:35:17.775
y-y-yes?

01:35:17.809 --> 01:35:18.976
you were saying that

01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:20.277
when the closet door
was opened,

01:35:20.312 --> 01:35:22.046
maria received
a bump on the head,

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.447
and from that,

01:35:23.481 --> 01:35:24.682
you infer that someone
had been hiding

01:35:24.716 --> 01:35:26.183
in the closet,
monsieur.

01:35:26.218 --> 01:35:28.085
she received a bump on--
and listen, monsieur.

01:35:28.119 --> 01:35:30.921
next time i may test you
without warning.

01:35:30.956 --> 01:35:33.190
so pay attention
at all times.

01:35:33.225 --> 01:35:34.491
yes, monsieur.

01:35:34.526 --> 01:35:38.596
now, then,
whoever was in that closet

01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:41.932
opened the door and
knocked maria unconscious,

01:35:41.967 --> 01:35:45.236
and whoever the man was
that was in that closet

01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:47.304
had a reason
to be in that closet.

01:35:47.339 --> 01:35:48.706
how do you know
it was a man?

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:51.675
because we found his
fingerprints, monsieur ballon,

01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:53.677
and...

01:35:54.813 --> 01:35:56.614
they were
your fingerprints.

01:35:56.648 --> 01:35:58.482
why not?
it's my house.

01:35:58.516 --> 01:35:59.850
i've often been
in that closet.

01:35:59.884 --> 01:36:00.851
for what reason?

01:36:00.885 --> 01:36:02.419
last time was moths.

01:36:02.454 --> 01:36:03.420
mirths?

01:36:03.455 --> 01:36:04.521
moths.

01:36:04.556 --> 01:36:05.656
yes, mirths.

01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:07.258
maria was
complaining of mirths.

01:36:07.292 --> 01:36:08.826
mirths?

01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:10.394
is that right, maria,

01:36:10.428 --> 01:36:12.630
that you were complaining
about these mirths?

01:36:12.664 --> 01:36:15.266
yes, i did complain
about moths.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.701
oh, you mean moths.

01:36:17.736 --> 01:36:19.270
oh, yes,
the flying moths.

01:36:19.304 --> 01:36:20.671
yes, of course,
of course, of course.

01:36:20.705 --> 01:36:23.274
what i do not
understand is that

01:36:23.308 --> 01:36:24.975
in a household
of this size,

01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:26.543
the question of moths

01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:27.811
should be brought
to the attention

01:36:27.846 --> 01:36:28.979
of monsieur ballon,

01:36:29.014 --> 01:36:30.014
not one of the servants

01:36:30.048 --> 01:36:31.548
or the local
moth exterminator.

01:36:31.583 --> 01:36:34.618
however, for the moment,
we will pass over that,

01:36:34.653 --> 01:36:37.955
and we will continue to
concentrate on another type

01:36:37.989 --> 01:36:41.158
of local exterminator.

01:37:08.653 --> 01:37:10.120
212,

01:37:10.155 --> 01:37:11.622
213,

01:37:11.656 --> 01:37:12.723
214.

01:37:12.757 --> 01:37:14.258
maria gambrelli,

01:37:14.292 --> 01:37:17.328
even though she now realizes
it was a mistake,

01:37:17.362 --> 01:37:19.363
is not the sort
of a woman

01:37:19.397 --> 01:37:20.431
to have
an affair with a man

01:37:20.465 --> 01:37:22.132
and then expose him.

01:37:22.167 --> 01:37:23.634
and we cannot condemn her

01:37:23.668 --> 01:37:25.436
because she does not believe
this man was a killer.

01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:29.840
but this man
was not only a killer,

01:37:29.874 --> 01:37:31.709
he was
an unprincipled villain

01:37:31.743 --> 01:37:33.177
who would rather see
maria gambrelli

01:37:33.211 --> 01:37:34.645
go to the guillotine

01:37:34.679 --> 01:37:36.213
than lose her
to another man.

01:37:36.247 --> 01:37:38.882
he was hiding in the closet
when she came into the room

01:37:38.917 --> 01:37:40.084
with the spaniard.

01:37:40.118 --> 01:37:41.985
he opened the door,
shot the spaniard,

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.687
and put the gun
in maria's hand.

01:37:43.722 --> 01:37:45.155
you don't know what
you're talking about.

01:37:45.190 --> 01:37:47.458
benjamin, shut up!

01:37:47.492 --> 01:37:49.993
you have something to say,
monsieur ballon?

01:37:50.028 --> 01:37:52.096
he has nothing
to say.

01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:53.630
no, but she has!

01:37:53.665 --> 01:37:54.732
why don't you
ask her?

01:37:54.766 --> 01:37:56.066
how dare you?

01:37:56.101 --> 01:37:58.769
she was having an affair
with my husband.

01:37:58.803 --> 01:37:59.837
liar!

01:37:59.871 --> 01:38:01.071
you are a fine one
to talk!

01:38:01.106 --> 01:38:02.106
your husband was
having an affair

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.407
with my wife!

01:38:03.441 --> 01:38:04.375
liar!

01:38:04.409 --> 01:38:05.376
thank you,
pierre.

01:38:05.410 --> 01:38:06.977
what about you
and simone?

01:38:07.011 --> 01:38:08.278
what about you
and georges?

01:38:08.313 --> 01:38:09.279
liar!

01:38:09.314 --> 01:38:10.414
you killed him!

01:38:10.448 --> 01:38:11.548
i saw you go
to the greenhouse

01:38:11.583 --> 01:38:12.783
before maria.

01:38:12.817 --> 01:38:14.184
he's crazy.
why should i kill georges?

01:38:14.219 --> 01:38:15.486
because you were having
an affair with him.

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:16.520
i should kill him
for that?

01:38:16.554 --> 01:38:17.921
you killed him

01:38:17.956 --> 01:38:19.056
because you knew he was
carrying on with madame.

01:38:19.090 --> 01:38:20.190

01:38:24.329 --> 01:38:26.497
because you discovered...

01:38:26.531 --> 01:38:28.699
you discovered that she was
having an affair with pierre.

01:38:28.733 --> 01:38:29.733

01:38:29.768 --> 01:38:31.068
she told me.

01:38:31.102 --> 01:38:32.836
of course she told you
because you and dudu

01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:33.904
were blackmailing
the madame.

01:38:33.938 --> 01:38:35.205

01:38:41.212 --> 01:38:43.180

right after the shooting.

01:38:43.214 --> 01:38:44.615

in the closet.

01:38:45.850 --> 01:38:47.985
my wife expected to
find me with maria

01:38:48.019 --> 01:38:49.219
and shot miguel
by accident.

01:38:49.254 --> 01:38:50.187
i put the gun
in maria's hand

01:38:50.221 --> 01:38:51.655
to protect my wife.
