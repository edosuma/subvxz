00:15.320 --> 00:18.290
A moccacino, please.
- Small, big or medium?

00:18.560 --> 00:21.882
Small. No, big.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.407
Are you waiting!
No, you'd rather make a small one.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.323
How big is "medium"?

00:27.640 --> 00:30.564
If you do not mind, I would be
happy to return for lunch.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.564
Sorry. Small.
- What's your name? - Ogul.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.450
I am glad.
- Ogul? How are you?

00:36.440 --> 00:40.889
I saw you since the party in French
Consulate no longer. - Do we know each other?

00:40.880 --> 00:42.803
Oh, we'll meet now.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.326
Glad, that's it at last
have managed to decide.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.005
In the time you needed
to decide between big and small

00:48.000 --> 00:50.526
the market has fallen by 50 points.
- Go on.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.525
Do not you have anything to say to me about this?
- I am very sorry.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.363
Yes, I hope so, sir.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.771
Moccacino!

01:15.120 --> 01:18.761
Someone call the police!
Attempted kidnapping at the Turkish consulate!

01:18.760 --> 01:21.604
Are you okay, Ogul?
- Yes, Tanya.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.809
You have already rescued me.
How do you do that?

01:24.800 --> 01:27.485
Her face is dirty, sir.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.925
Already gone.
- Thank you.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.609
Gentlemen and Tanya,
I want to introduce you to Wes Thompson,

01:43.600 --> 01:46.843
President of Continental Titanium.
Mr. Thompson,

01:46.840 --> 01:49.969
These are the best bodyguards
and security professionals,

01:49.960 --> 01:52.281
which you can buy with money.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.925
Very pleased, lady.
So you are also an agent?

01:56.320 --> 01:58.322
I am. I am glad.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.204
Let's see if your people
really as taffy as you say.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.688
Not so tight, Tanya.
If you break his hand,

02:15.680 --> 02:18.570
he can not sign the contract.
- Sir.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.888
You can grab.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.928
Well, I see, I'm right with you.

02:33.240 --> 02:38.121
So the situation.
This is a routine task.

02:39.160 --> 02:43.245
You understand, I have
a large number of business opponents.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.811
Happens,
if you make your way up.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.644
You know, you have to smash eggs,
if you want an omelet.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.406
Now it looks like one of those eggs
returns to the nest, so to speak.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.210
And now you want us to protect you.
- No, not me.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.522
Oh, Sally, it's all perfect
with the wedding preparations. - You.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.285
Daddy and I are
gone through the offers of the caterers,

03:01.280 --> 03:04.045
and we already know who it will be.
London Catering, of course.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.964
And I'm at Neiman's right now
seen the most precious gift basket.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.247
You can die for that.
- Stop it, Daisy.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.766
We came here because of you.

03:12.040 --> 03:16.011
Same, Daddy, one second.
Listen, Sally, it's going to be so exciting

03:16.000 --> 03:19.163
It could not go better.
My company has gone off like a rocket,

03:19.160 --> 03:24.166
we are planning a billion-dollar takeover.
And my little girl will marry.

03:24.160 --> 03:28.961
Everything was perfect,
until then this turned up.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.088
It started a few days ago.
Who does something like that?

03:33.400 --> 03:37.724
Who threatens the life of my little one
Girl a week before the wedding?

03:37.720 --> 03:40.963
Besides the business opponents,
is there anyone

03:40.960 --> 03:44.043
who would not treat her?
Friends, family members

03:44.040 --> 03:46.805
Listen, lady, the Thompson clan
may be a bit eccentric,

03:46.800 --> 03:49.246
but we are not sick guys.

03:49.240 --> 03:53.165
Sir, the first principle
In personal protection means: nothing is impossible.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.925
We will take a closer look.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.651
The police have you
not yet turned on, right?

03:58.640 --> 04:01.962
Do it if you think it necessary.
But for now, it's important

04:01.960 --> 04:06.329
that we keep the matter secret. It is
a very sensitive time, the acquisition.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.210
I definitely do not want
that the partners are unsettled.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.726
I need the best.
That's why we're here.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.203
Sweetheart?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.363
One second.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.045
We celebrate the wedding on our estate.
A wedding in the old Texas style.

04:21.040 --> 04:25.090
The festival lasts a full five days.
Here in our good old California.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.005
A little intimate affair,
only family and close friends.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.608
I do not want to take any risks.
We lost her mother,

04:33.600 --> 04:37.161
a few years ago.
And Daisy is the most important thing for me.

04:37.160 --> 04:41.927
Nothing, but absolutely nothing
means more to me than my little girl.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.971
Sorry, Daddy, Sally did not want to stop
to talk. But she likes my idea.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.601
So, instead of at the wedding banquet
just to have flowers on the tables,

04:50.600 --> 04:53.331
how about bears?

04:54.840 --> 04:58.526
Which one do I take?
The wedding bear or

04:58.520 --> 05:00.921
the Buffalo Bobby Bear.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.086
No idea.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.766
Oh, and Daddy,
The wedding planner had a great idea.

05:10.760 --> 05:14.651
So, the lettering "Love forever"
in pink roses at the entrance

05:14.640 --> 05:17.610
and carnation flowers
in the form of a heart at the altar.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.444
What are you saying?
- Yes, whatever you want, sweetheart.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.090
What a day.
I do not know where my head is.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.243
What is this about?
Photographers or decorators?

05:27.240 --> 05:32.167
They do not look like decorators.
- No honey, these are the security people.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.642
Darling, we want to be sure
that runs smoothly at your wedding.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.690
Is it about these papers?
Why this whole vortex?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.691
Someone has a fun,
that's all.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.603
I want to be sure,
nobody cares you even a hair

05:44.600 --> 05:48.764
your pretty head is bending.
- You do not have to worry.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.606
We always have a team in the environment
and a team directly at the client.

05:53.240 --> 05:58.167
Nobody can get too close to your daughter.
- What? No way!

05:59.880 --> 06:01.484
Baby!

06:06.000 --> 06:07.923
Daisy, honey!

06:09.040 --> 06:13.250
Daddy, I do not want a bunch of gorilla guys,
who are wallowing around me.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.720
That breaks the wedding.
- We spoke about it. - Yes,

06:15.720 --> 06:18.371
but I did not think that
a whole armada of James Bond agents

06:18.360 --> 06:22.843
comes to my wedding party.
That totally ruins the atmosphere.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.571
Be sensible, sweetheart.
- Daddy, a wedding is about love,

06:25.560 --> 06:27.528
for dedication, for commonality.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.320
Not about any with steroids
inflated bodysuits, - seriously?

06:31.320 --> 06:33.891
The groping the bridesmaids!

06:36.840 --> 06:38.729
sweetheart

06:45.160 --> 06:47.288
Pretty spoiled princess.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.723
You know, Tanya, you can never
to judge a book by its cover.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.087
This cover is an insult to books.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.323
She is under great pressure.
- That's understandable.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.370
We have to handle that
without compromising safety.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.887
I do not admit that my daughter
an attacker is defenseless.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.848
To our job
to be able to execute effectively

07:05.840 --> 07:08.047
we need
unrestricted access to the client.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.725
We could disguise our team as a caterer.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.167
That would only be temporary. I would like,
that there is always someone at your side

07:14.160 --> 07:17.881
If discretion is a must and
it should also be unobtrusive at the same time

07:17.880 --> 07:22.124
maybe we could undercover someone
as a wedding guest.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.647
Continue. - If you want someone
being with the bride all week,

07:25.640 --> 07:30.009
why not a groomsman,
or better, a bridesmaid.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.925
She is always at her side, at the
Events, the parties, the food.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.242
Someone who is perfect
integrated and not noticeable.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.242
Someone who is
- As.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.891
I beg your pardon?
- That's perfect. - no.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.724
They are constantly with the bride,
without arousing suspicion.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.166
And the rest of the team
can hold in the background,

07:47.160 --> 07:48.605
until they are needed.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.931
You are just one of the girls

07:49.920 --> 07:51.445
and could all scrutinize

07:51.440 --> 07:53.522
approaching Daisy on more than 10 steps.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.241
Yes, I can sell Daisy.
- Then we have a deal now.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.409
Sir, I do not want to do that.
I can not.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.562
Prince Vandar
come to town next week.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.962
That can also do Danforth.
Tanja, this is far too important.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.804
Thompson is a crucial client for us.
- I know that.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.326
And you know, I would
go through the fire for a client,

08:21.320 --> 08:24.005
just not in front of the wedding altar.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.970
Send me abroad,
to protect a greedy dictator.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.803
I am also ready,
Protect witnesses from the mob.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.043
I take care of myself
again Gary Busey.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.962
Alone, if you ask me to.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.530
But please spare me hereby.
I can not stand it.

08:36.520 --> 08:40.285
But you have to go through that, Tanya.
He wants the best.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.931
And his company
wants after successful takeover

08:42.919 --> 08:47.209
a million-dollar contract
complete with a security company.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.044
Sir, you might know something.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.850
Weddings and me
are not very good at it.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.640
Why not?
- I do not want to go into that.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.167
Tanya, you are a professional, right?
They are made for great things,

09:00.160 --> 09:02.561
maybe also for a partnership.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.770
But first and foremost
follow instructions.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.167
So, for clarification. Someone is trying
to prevent this wedding

09:11.800 --> 09:15.361
and you will see to it
smoothly and without interference taking place.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.601
But, sir
- Think about it.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.847
If you do not want to do it,
I expect your answer at the latest tomorrow.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.165
<i> Stop firing. Unload weapon.
The passage is over. </ I></i>

10:18.760 --> 10:22.401
You killed the groom.
Do you want to talk about it? - no.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.324
I just can not believe
that Chesterton puts me to the election.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.051
My job or this job.
- This is an ascent.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.407
You lead your own team.
- That is not all.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.768
He even offered to become a partner,
when I do this job.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.967
Hey, then do it.
I do not know where the problem is.

10:35.960 --> 10:40.807
The wedding is the problem. You know, do not you,
how much I hate weddings. Really!

10:42.000 --> 10:45.686
Honestly, I can not do that.
- Clearly you can do that.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.364
You just always have to
Think of the mustard seed. - To what?

10:49.360 --> 10:52.807
Well, even the faith, so big
like a mustard seed, can move mountains.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.246
Thanks for feeding, Henry.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.244
But weddings
I swore for all time.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.527
What's wrong with that, Tanya?
Come on!

11:00.520 --> 11:02.648
I lead your background team,
and we are right there,

11:02.640 --> 11:06.247
if you need a shoulder to cry,
or to break.

11:07.960 --> 11:13.285
How is it looking? - I have
never rejected a job before.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.171
What do I hear now?
- Stop it! - What do I hear?

11:18.560 --> 11:23.202
Okay, I'll do it.
But I do not wear chiffon, right?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.282
That's what you wear.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.850
<i> Hi, darling, this is Mom. </ i></i>

11:40.840 --> 11:42.922
<i> I hope
You'll be visiting again soon. </ i></i>

11:42.920 --> 11:45.400
<i> I just wanted to tell you
that I know about "you know who" </ i></i>

11:45.400 --> 11:48.609
<i> read something in the business section.
You're a hundred times better off without him. </ I></i>

11:48.600 --> 11:51.604
<i> By the way, your dad was
bitten by the cat again. </ i></i>

11:51.600 --> 11:53.682
<i> I love you. </ i></i>

12:05.200 --> 12:08.090
Do you want, Tanya,
the Kevin present here

12:08.080 --> 12:13.211
to take husband, love and honor him,
until death divides you?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.328
And if I want.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.442
Do you want, Kevin,
take the Tanya present here as a wife,

12:19.440 --> 12:23.081
love and honor them,
until death divides you?

12:23.880 --> 12:25.848
I

12:31.600 --> 12:35.321
Tell me. Do not fool around, Kevin.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.970
I

12:40.520 --> 12:42.522
Tanya, me

12:44.600 --> 12:46.807
I can not. I have to go.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.730
That is unbelievable.
- Is that a joke or what?

13:14.680 --> 13:17.490
Hi! Pick-up service!

13:17.960 --> 13:21.009
You have to be Tanya.
I'm Sally, and that's Kimmy.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.130
We want to collect you.
- Come on board! - How exciting.

13:29.040 --> 13:33.125
The three bridesmaids are in a good mood
and ready for her performance.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.602
I think our bridesmaid dresses are great.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.286
And how.
You must like them too, Tanya.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.881
As long as I do not
be confused with the wedding cake.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.169
She is funny. I like her.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.050
Oh, Tanya, you are right for us.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.204
Here, we must not forget that.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.731
Another bridesmaid.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.163
Hello!

14:24.840 --> 14:27.571
Oh really,
I can not remember you anymore.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.121
But I feel like I am you
have known all my life

14:31.120 --> 14:33.805
I am Daisy's Aunt Helen.
And I'm so happy

14:33.800 --> 14:36.007
that you came to the wedding.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.729
Tanya!

14:40.720 --> 14:44.441
Listen, as my bridesmaid
At least you could try to smile.

14:44.440 --> 14:47.284
That's my smile.
- The bridesmaids help the bride,

14:47.280 --> 14:50.329
to make a special day
and do not bargot your teeth.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.450
Believe me, as long as I only
Teeth fletsche, that is less painful.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.408
I do my best.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.368
Patrick Andrews! Oh my God!
- Daisy!

15:00.960 --> 15:03.327
I can not believe
that you are already getting married.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.207
And then look who's still there.

15:06.200 --> 15:10.330
Oh, Mr Bosworth!
- How are you, Daisy? My congratulations.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.729
Many Thanks.
It's so nice that you are here.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.963
Oh, may I give you one
introduce my bridesmaids? Tanya.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.601
Tanya, that's Mr Bosworth,
the business partner of my father.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.251
Was, dear.
I was your father's business partner.

15:23.240 --> 15:28.724
In the meantime, I have resigned.
I am very pleased. - Me too.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.326
Aunt, do not play
the inconspicuous purple spot!

15:31.320 --> 15:33.322
Come here and talk to Tanya!

15:33.320 --> 15:37.370
We met already.
What are you for a pretty thing!

15:37.360 --> 15:40.091
If you are not careful,
then we will meet you during the week

15:40.080 --> 15:42.447
still with someone verkuppeln.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.761
I see,
that you do not yet wear a ring on your finger.

15:44.760 --> 15:49.163
We have to do something about that. - Perhaps
look at the wrong finger.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.043
The supporter team
has gone into position.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.964
We work from a catering van
outside at the delivery entrance.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.361
That's our base, so to speak.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.170
And your guests will not notice
that we are there.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.731
We have the room for you
finished right next to Daisy.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.406
Then you can keep an eye on them.
- Do not I have any privacy anymore?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.641
We do not know yet,
what we are dealing with.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.769
It could be a single madman
or even a group of professionals.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.604
Everyone is suspicious at this point.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.444
So, the fewer people
know about us, the better.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.410
Can I at least mine
- Would you please help us

16:29.400 --> 16:31.607
to do our job,
and not tell anyone?

16:31.600 --> 16:35.082
Good, if you say that
but I still do not understand

16:35.080 --> 16:37.526
what is the whole thing.
- Yes, and, Daisy, I beg you,

16:37.520 --> 16:42.367
to wear this.
This is a tracking transmitter with GPS support.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.887
This bites me totally with my outfit.
- Your blood too.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.726
So, whenever you need me,
just press this button here

16:50.040 --> 16:53.522
and I'll be there in 30 seconds. OK?
- Okay.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.486
A message. Carlo is here.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.442
Exactly there.
- Carlo! Buongiorno!

17:16.040 --> 17:19.601
Bellissima. Bella Bianca,
all in white for wedding.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.729
I want white silk.
There and there too. The

17:22.720 --> 17:26.611
will flank the swans and the white horses,
if they pull the carriage, no?

17:26.599 --> 17:30.002
A beautiful idea.
- Yes. The plants must all go out!

17:30.000 --> 17:32.571
I just want to see white! White roses!

17:33.160 --> 17:34.889
Madness!

17:36.600 --> 17:41.447
Hi. - Hi. - The safety precautions
here are poor. We have a goal,

17:41.440 --> 17:44.922
that falls off its hinges, and a wall,
which is good for decoration at best.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.161
We need motion detectors
around the property,

17:47.160 --> 17:49.242
and I would say
Cameras on all four sides.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.483
Will be done. Here, your earplug.
- Oh yeah.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.249
Transmitter.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.249
Really pretty.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.164
Thank you.
- Yes.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.011
Who is there?

18:19.720 --> 18:22.644
Pookie!
- Pookie. - Hey!

18:27.400 --> 18:30.927
Oh, Chip, honey, I want you
introduce my old friend from college.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.561
Tanya, she is one of my bridesmaids.
- Hi. - Hi.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.846
And my congratulations
for your big day.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.371
Man! Careful with the golf bag,
the driver costs two giants!

18:48.480 --> 18:50.881
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.568
This will be great fun. - Yes,
I'm so glad you came.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.246
Oh, Betsy, may I introduce you to Tanya?
A roommate from college. - Hi.

19:03.240 --> 19:07.325
And I am glad that she too
as one of my bridesmaids is here.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.522
We have been best friends for ages.
- Yes, since the first grade.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.366
No, since the kindergarten.
- Betsy is our mother hen.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.886
And when she says "kindergarten",
then it is like that.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.168
You already know Sally and Kimmy.
- Oh, God, that's going to be gigantic.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.050
Can you?
feel the excitement? OK.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.123
First, the bridal party,
then we sip the champagne

19:30.120 --> 19:33.169
and then we check the guys!

19:34.200 --> 19:36.407
This will be great fun!

19:37.600 --> 19:40.251
Tanya? Screech.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.726
Tanya, Tanya, that's funny.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.961
I can not remember,
ever heard of you.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.167
Oh, Daisy and me
were only one month roommates.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.811
Then I changed to college.
But of course we decided

19:52.800 --> 19:57.408
Stay in Touch.
Because hello-o F-w-e

19:57.400 --> 20:01.121
F-w-e. Wow!
- Friendship lasts forever.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.401
Very good move.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.850
Here are the boys.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.924
Hey boys!
- What's up buddy?

20:10.920 --> 20:12.729
Oh, people!

20:13.040 --> 20:16.044
As in Daytona Beach.
- Hi!

20:16.040 --> 20:19.203
Come here!
- Hey! - Here are the girls.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.205
Who does not know the guys yet
Rich, Vince, my little brother Robbie

20:24.280 --> 20:27.648
And the guy here is my best friend Jake.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.206
Girls, I am glad to see you again.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.409
Jake, Robbie, may I introduce Tanya?

20:34.400 --> 20:39.247
Tanya is the last access
in the bridesmaid office. She is new to the city.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.049
Hi.
- Hi.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.840
Hi. Jake. I hope you know
what you did to yourself.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.481
This gang is already planning the wedding,
since I was in 4th grade.

20:49.160 --> 20:54.451
Jake is studying law at Vanderbilt.
- Really? - What are you doing, Tanya?

20:54.440 --> 20:56.761
I'm curious.
- I - She is a kindergarten teacher.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.206
Pretty hard.
- Is not that cute?

20:59.200 --> 21:02.283
That's such a nice job. Do you like it?

21:02.280 --> 21:06.842
Well, it's like being the mother
of 20 children at the same time.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.762
Well said.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.764
I'll go in then.
- Bye, Tanya.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.403
She is really nice.
- Seems pretty taffy. - I like her.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.040
Already settled?
- Probably not.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.042
Do we already have an analysis?
the party participant?

21:30.040 --> 21:33.567
Yes, we have the connection.
Well. Let's take a look.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.530
Reads himself
like a "who's who" of millionaire children.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.244
What do we have about the bridesmaids?
- Food only from silver spoons.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.323
None of them ever worked one day.
Betsy Monroe.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.891
She is practically America's aristocracy.

21:46.880 --> 21:51.283
She can change her lineage
attributed two different presidents.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.720
Filthy rich. Her family owns companies,
that make pretty much everything,

21:55.720 --> 21:58.724
from watches to wedding cakes. Mega coal.

21:58.720 --> 22:02.008
Yes, she looks funny, at least to me.
Keep an eye on her.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.961
What about the wedding planner?

22:05.400 --> 22:10.042
Carlo Santi. He used to go to the
Thompsons started with corporate events.

22:10.040 --> 22:13.840
But now also makes weddings.
Has a pretty big customer list.

22:13.840 --> 22:17.049
Seems to be okay.
The witnesses are buddies from college.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.567
No angels, but during spring break
something about the severity.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.086
And what about our lover boy?
- The groom?

22:23.080 --> 22:27.449
Daddy manages a hedge fund,
and Junior is employed as V.I.P. Specialist.

22:27.440 --> 22:30.364
Translation?
He spends his time in polo, rugby

22:30.360 --> 22:33.967
and loses his money in horse racing.
A real heartthrob in college.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.203
Clear.
- He is nesting. Fits to him.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.851
And his best friend Jake?
- Good that you ask.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.605
She said,
he is studying law at Vanderbilt.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.410
I checked the registration,
and he does not study law there.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.244
I have not found it anywhere else either.
Well, I keep digging.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.241
Interesting.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.410
Please do not behave
like a bodyguard. - Yes, okay.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.530
Do you have a weapon?
Not? Oh no! There's chips mother.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.682
Protect me.
- Why, what's up with her?

23:02.680 --> 23:05.729
See you soon. Hello, Constance.

23:05.720 --> 23:09.042
Daisy, you have to tell your dad
he should fire your gardener.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.089
The lawn is simple and simple
a weed jungle.

23:12.080 --> 23:16.563
Oh, of course. May I give you one
introduce my bridesmaids? Tanya.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.291
Hello, I'm glad.
- Pretty.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.685
Chip, darling,
you have to show me the tux,

23:23.680 --> 23:26.047
you will wear to the wedding.
- We have to look,

23:26.040 --> 23:28.486
if it has already been delivered.
- What, not yet? - After you.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.003
Wow! Very friendly.
- My future mother-in-law.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.480
She thinks,
Chip could make a better match.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.563
I'm only good for 50 million.
I guess you'd rather

23:38.560 --> 23:43.122
Chip would marry a DuPont.
- May I ask for your attention?

23:44.360 --> 23:47.921
We would like to thank you,
that you have to this happy occasion

23:47.920 --> 23:51.766
have come to us.
I tell you, rest,

23:51.760 --> 23:55.287
because we have many events,
that lie ahead of us.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.321
For example football.
Tomorrow morning. An old Thompson tradition.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.605
This is our year, people.
This time we'll pack it.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.483
Henry,
we have to do something with the trees

24:09.480 --> 24:12.404
<i> in </ i> sector <i> L 5 </ i>.
They provide a perfect overview,</i></i>

24:12.400 --> 24:15.051
if we have it
to deal with a shooter.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.805
<i> Being done, Tanya.
Now dive in. </ I></i>

24:17.800 --> 24:19.245
Who knows,
maybe there is one for you too.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.042
Sorry. BVG

24:30.320 --> 24:32.368
Did you speak with your hand?

24:32.360 --> 24:36.968
Oh, me among so many people
I am always a bit shy.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.930
That's why I'm testing,
what I want to say.

24:40.600 --> 24:44.161
Are you studying law?
- Actually, the Daisy said.

24:44.160 --> 24:47.164
How's it going?
- Oh good. I

24:47.160 --> 24:50.562
I find such a wedding
has something special. Not romantically?

24:50.560 --> 24:54.849
Strangers meet, fall in love.
It's like Noah's Ark.

24:54.840 --> 24:58.731
The animals always come in pairs in the boat.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.361
What is going on in these people's minds?
- Me

25:03.360 --> 25:07.001
I already had three old ladies
and a WWII general,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.367
me with a bridesmaid
wanted to get involved. I swear,

25:09.360 --> 25:12.091
when another comes,
I give myself beaten. Final.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.606
Keep telling.
- Why do some people have to

25:14.600 --> 25:16.807
the opportunity
always use the same for a wedding,

25:16.800 --> 25:19.610
around singles in the area
of 300 miles to pair up?

25:19.600 --> 25:23.082
I do not know.
But I know exactly what you mean.

25:23.320 --> 25:27.291
I did not know that you can laugh too.
- I do not do.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.249
And? How is it going?
- I have the best time of my life.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.210
Do not eat things like that in yourself.
Do not want to see what happens

25:39.200 --> 25:41.441
when you explode.
- very funny.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.081
Do you have more information?
about Robbie, the little brother?

25:44.080 --> 25:46.686
No, but I have something
learn about cousin Eldridge.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.524
He and Daisy
would divide the family company.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.807
But if Daisy and Chip
Have children,

25:51.800 --> 25:55.407
turns half of a third.
That's a 10 million loss.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.688
Inheritance, that would be a good motive.
We also have the mother-in-law,

25:58.680 --> 26:01.411
who believes
that no one is good enough for her angel.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.483
There is one more.
Bosworth, Thompson's business partner.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.484
He did not go voluntarily. He was pushed.
- For the takeover to pass?

26:07.480 --> 26:11.485
Bingo. And Aunt Helen.
She manages the Family Education Fund.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.006
You should rather him
call the Jewelery Fund.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.368
But he's dry
since Thompson does not sponsor him anymore. - Revenge?

26:17.920 --> 26:20.127
She does not seem to be the type for me
but you never know

26:20.120 --> 26:23.920
what people are capable of.
What about our student? Jake.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.488
Nothing so far. Since he's high school
left a few years ago,

26:27.480 --> 26:29.960
he does not seem to exist anymore.
- Keep searching, yes?

26:29.960 --> 26:31.928
There's something about this guy
that lets me assume

26:31.920 --> 26:34.207
that he is not that
what he claims to be.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.443
I do not know what, but do you hear?

26:38.760 --> 26:42.731
What? I do not hear anything. - Just it.
The crickets are no longer heard.

26:44.880 --> 26:48.771
There. A burglar on the east wing.
Follow him. I cut off his path.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.049
Man!

26:56.200 --> 26:59.329
What are you doing there?
I asked Claire

26:59.320 --> 27:01.971
to help me find my contact lens.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.008
I have to go somewhere
lost here at the pool.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.844
Did you just see someone here?
- no.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.122
As I said, I miss the contact lens.
- Right.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.883
Thank you.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.923
Tanya, he disappeared.
- What?

27:23.920 --> 27:26.491
Did you recognize who it was?
- no. But I think,

27:26.480 --> 27:28.847
I have just the groom
caught with an employee.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.491
Are you sure?
- Yes, pretty sure.

27:43.160 --> 27:47.085
Wow! What is all this?
- We are leaving for the last time.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.560
The boutique has sent stuff
that we may need.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.801
Why go shopping,
when shopping comes to you?

27:51.800 --> 27:55.486
Only a few things. When you're done,
Let's check all the ways.

27:55.480 --> 27:59.201
Hello. You are the only bridesmaid
which is not completely electrified.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.885
Certainly we still find
something nice for you.

28:01.880 --> 28:06.329
No, I do not think so.
- Tanya, your attitude. ladys

28:08.640 --> 28:12.770
This is my last fitting.
This is important. You know,

28:12.760 --> 28:15.570
I would welcome it,
if you want something more in your attitude

28:15.560 --> 28:17.688
would work.
- I work hard.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.603
I work hard
To protect you in the background.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.843
Do not you understand? As a bridesmaid
do you depend on the other girls

28:22.840 --> 28:26.287
makes nonsense,
talks about guys and clothes.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.965
You can do that, right?
Adapt

28:28.960 --> 28:32.248
or you end up as a wallflower.
- As what?

28:34.120 --> 28:36.282
I'm sorry.
- Maybe that sounds a bit cheesy,

28:36.280 --> 28:38.806
but to be bridesmaid
is a sacred duty.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.280
An honor, something very special.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.565
So, help me, a garter
to find, and I am prepared.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.763
Oh my God! Oh!

28:49.760 --> 28:53.048
Just look
this adorable little pillow! Oh!

28:53.040 --> 28:55.771
We already have one.
But is not that adorable?

28:55.760 --> 29:00.163
I do not really know
- Oh, my God, is not that adorable?

29:00.560 --> 29:06.090
How should I explain this to you?
So, you shop, and I protect you.

29:06.400 --> 29:09.643
By the way, you master
any kind of self-defense?

29:09.640 --> 29:13.850
I raised my elbow as me
wanted to grab a bag.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.925
Well.
- Oh my God!

29:17.680 --> 29:22.004
That's insane.
But not before the honeymoon.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.927
We are waiting.
- Honestly?

29:25.920 --> 29:28.207
What do you think if the chip is like?

29:28.200 --> 29:32.444
I think Chip likes a lot.
- Yes, he is really very open-minded.

29:32.440 --> 29:37.287
One of the things that I love about him.
- Are you sure that he is the right person?

29:37.560 --> 29:40.564
Of course I'm sure.
What is the stupid question?

29:40.560 --> 29:43.848
You do not really know him, right?
- What do you mean?

29:44.080 --> 29:47.971
I mean, I'm here for giving you
hurts coming through your wedding party.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.248
Oh, my God, we are too late
to football! Come!

29:52.160 --> 29:55.482
It is so far!
Long live the family tradition.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.881
We play football.

29:59.160 --> 30:03.484
You are with us. - Do not you have girls?
Afraid to get hurt before the wedding?

30:03.480 --> 30:06.802
There are only two things
that really interest us Texas girls.

30:06.800 --> 30:10.282
The semi-annual sale
at Neiman's and Football.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.206
Are the teams ready?
- Yes, let's start!

30:13.720 --> 30:17.520
Wait. I'm getting Tanya.
- Sorry, bro, that's on our side.

30:17.520 --> 30:22.048
I would like to play with Daisy.
- Okay. Then I get a chip. - Yes.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.125
Contact lens found?

30:26.120 --> 30:30.648
Hey, good luck.
Your page has no chance.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.803
In this exam,
Law student, you rattle through.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.642
Hat, hat, hat!

31:21.520 --> 31:23.284
I have that!

31:24.400 --> 31:27.847
Very quiet, Bosworth.
- What's up, Thompson?

31:27.840 --> 31:29.968
Do you think
I am no longer able to fight,

31:29.960 --> 31:32.930
since I'm no longer in the store?

31:39.120 --> 31:40.884
Hat, hat, hat!

32:01.480 --> 32:05.041
Young man,
You have the decency of an ox!

32:05.040 --> 32:06.690
I'm sorry.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.280
Go on!
- hat, hat, hat!

32:26.160 --> 32:28.527
Look there!
- Thanks, Daisy.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.010
Here!

32:39.360 --> 32:42.330
Not my day. Who comes now?

32:43.160 --> 32:45.322
I try it.
Nice that I'm allowed to participate.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.607
Oh, we love pretty ladies.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.250
You just can not do that
shoot in the back.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.811
Shoot in the back
is more of a character trait

32:51.800 --> 32:55.646
the Thompson family, right?
- So, Tanya, before the disc comes,

32:55.640 --> 32:58.211
you have to keep the run absolutely straight.
Can you see it?

32:58.200 --> 33:01.170
Yes, but remember
the mouth should always point down,

33:01.160 --> 33:03.811
until you are ready.
Press firmly on the shoulder.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.724
And do not tear the trigger,
but press gently.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.121
Roger that. Thank's for the Tipps.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.647
Nice to have you here. Daisy says
that you will retire soon.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.961
Do not believe everything you hear.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.329
Okay, let's go, Tanya!
You dont need to be scared.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.682
OK.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.129
Pull!

33:27.400 --> 33:29.129
Uh-oh!

33:29.600 --> 33:32.729
I suppose that did not work.
- Do not worry, honey,

33:32.720 --> 33:34.324
they are clay pigeons, they do not feel anything.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.927
Do not forget the muzzle end
that's what you shoot.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.690
It's okay, sweetheart,
is also more of a men's sport.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.081
Hell, my wife would not even
to hit a barn door,

33:44.080 --> 33:46.731
even if she stood in front of it.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.123
Double Pull!

33:59.760 --> 34:03.606
Oh, man, only beginner luck, probably.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.091
Oh, so late.
I still miss the bridal shower.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.606
I wish the men a lot of fun.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.440
Wait until you see my shoes.
You will die.

34:17.440 --> 34:22.606
Oh, madness!
- I have a lot of surprises.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.763
Do you have games too?
- You know Sally.

34:25.760 --> 34:29.481
Games? - Naturally.
Sally is the queen of the organization.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.924
For one we need
- Oh, I love that.

34:33.679 --> 34:36.842
A bridal party to get to know
is such a great idea.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.400
Yes. Now only have to
the boys are there, and who knows, ladies,

34:40.400 --> 34:44.166
Maybe there's a double wedding.
Interested persons?

34:44.159 --> 34:46.925
Between you and Jake
appeared this morning at football

34:46.920 --> 34:51.208
to vote the chemistry yes. - no.
- Time for our favorite pastime.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.969
We ask a question
and answer in a circle.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.768
We do that since we were kids.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.560
And, Tanya, you're one of us now.
So you're there too.

35:00.560 --> 35:05.566
Ladys, what's up for you
the most beautiful at a wedding?

35:06.280 --> 35:09.568
For me it's the hair.

35:09.960 --> 35:14.522
All hairstyles
are just perfect on the wedding day.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.649
I swarm for lace.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.768
To me
only the love oath comes into question.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.488
I especially like the witnesses.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.769
Tanya, what's up for a wedding?
always the best?

35:28.760 --> 35:31.525
Oh, that's hard to say.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.570
But a fantastic question.

35:39.320 --> 35:43.325
The most beautiful thing for me is the bouquet.

35:43.640 --> 35:50.489
Because I love roses,
romantically tied, to a bouquet,

35:50.480 --> 35:54.201
with the bond of togetherness.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.562
Is not that cute?

35:58.640 --> 36:01.689
Where we talk about commonality,

36:02.080 --> 36:04.811
Let's start with the bridal games!

36:21.040 --> 36:25.329
Okay, it's time for the wedding dress.
We only use toilet paper

36:25.320 --> 36:29.086
and make a wedding dress out of it
for the cardboard bride. OK? Come on!

36:43.800 --> 36:48.567
Okay, and now we have the Adonis balloon.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.565
The first, the dream types
Balloon won, okay? Here.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.763
Oh, my uncle was a knife thrower in the circus.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.886
Yes, it goes without saying.
- Now it's around. - Ladies?

37:36.160 --> 37:40.563
Now the party is really getting started.
- Hi. - Hey boys.

37:48.080 --> 37:51.766
Hey, Tanya! At some point I will get you
on my side. - Really?

37:51.760 --> 37:55.401
How do you like it here?
- I think it's great. Thank you.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.561
Do you know if Jake is from the area?

37:59.040 --> 38:02.010
Yes, that's from here.
I myself come from Long Island.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.209
But the people here know how to party.
- Yes, definitely.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.407
How did you meet?

38:07.400 --> 38:10.324
My family
owns a property on Palm Beach.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.324
Maybe you'll visit me there.
I'll show you the area.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.561
Say, Robbie,
I have just seen,

38:15.560 --> 38:18.006
that you are the waitress
smiled at the back.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.651
She has to have a crush on you.
- Do you think?

38:20.640 --> 38:24.964
Yes. Hurry up.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.842
I'm sorry.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.525
And? How do you get
life in the midst of the landed gentry?

38:33.520 --> 38:38.731
Oh, very good, thanks.
And? Are you studying law?

38:39.720 --> 38:42.041
Is that important?
- What do you think?

38:42.040 --> 38:45.249
Whether I am a law student?
I mean, we would talk,

38:45.240 --> 38:49.131
if I were a garbage man?
- It was just a question.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.161
Or are you hiding something?
- You ask too many questions.

38:53.320 --> 38:57.405
I'm just a curious guy.
- I'm sorry, but I'm sick of it,

38:57.400 --> 39:00.882
that my fortune decides
whether a conversation lasts longer than a "hello".

39:00.880 --> 39:04.601
How do you feel that I am such a person?
- Take a look around!

39:06.120 --> 39:08.600
You never know.
Just take Betsy there as an example.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.320
Did you know that she and Chip
were in college together?

39:11.320 --> 39:15.245
But she had first left him
until she has his name.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.724
But I am not like that.

39:21.160 --> 39:24.926
Would you maybe dance with me?
- no. Certainly not.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.810
Well, maybe you change your mind.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.360
I do not want,
that you embarrass me at my wedding,

39:33.360 --> 39:36.011
by standing on the side
like a wallflower.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.288
That is what you are doing.
- That's not part of my job description.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.282
I'm here,
because I have to take care of you.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.648
It's also possible with a smile.
Come! Go to him already!

39:44.640 --> 39:46.802
Come!
- Yes, but - Well, go!

39:50.000 --> 39:53.288
OK. I am ready to give it a try.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.204
Really?

40:06.640 --> 40:11.441
Do you do that more often, that you try,
To impress women on the dance floor?

40:11.440 --> 40:14.330
Why not? Works.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.968
Your best friend
likes to take a look out the window.

40:23.560 --> 40:28.885
Chip? No. He is as loyal as a dog.
Believe me, he loves Daisy.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.281
Well, let's hope.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.250
Well!

40:56.840 --> 40:58.922
Come on, Tanya!

41:02.000 --> 41:04.082
That's all?

41:21.880 --> 41:24.167
Am I wrong?

41:26.600 --> 41:29.046
I never mislead me in the end.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.931
Come on, Daisy.
Wake up, the guy is playing wrong.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.044
Hey!

41:41.200 --> 41:44.966
Why are you doing this?
- Because you have sneaked up on me.

41:44.960 --> 41:48.965
No. I did not rank myself.
- But.

41:48.960 --> 41:52.726
No. I said "Hey". This is not
the same as sneaking up.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.362
I'm sorry, I was scared.
- Yes, you are very pale.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.289
And

42:02.800 --> 42:07.044
What do you want with the binoculars?
- I watch birds.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.930
Yes, I watch birds.
The kids like it.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.161
A tensioner?

42:15.160 --> 42:18.767
No. - Tanya, hey, hey!
That was fun, nothing else. - I have to go.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.766
Watch out for the black-throated night swallows.
- Wait, Tanya, wait!

42:21.760 --> 42:25.481
Why are you always running away? Tanya!

42:29.480 --> 42:31.164
Funny insert.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.606
No, that was embarrassing. Where is Daisy going?

42:33.880 --> 42:38.363
She went in with her sweetheart.
I think they are in the south wing.

42:39.400 --> 42:42.882
That's Daisy's alarm. I'm on the road.
Check the property! Immediately!

42:50.640 --> 42:53.564
Daisy!
- Tanya!

42:53.560 --> 42:56.848
Listen, we are busy.
- Tanya, what are you doing here?

43:01.680 --> 43:05.162
Well, not a moment too soon
how I see it, right?

43:05.160 --> 43:08.642
Not before the wedding.
- We just kiss.

43:08.640 --> 43:11.246
Yes, that's how it always starts.
- That should be a joke.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.129
Maybe she's right.
- You heard her.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.885
The rest follows in the wedding night.
- I am sorry.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.248
I have to sound the alarm by mistake
have triggered. - That was close.

43:19.240 --> 43:22.005
Oh my God!
Have you seen chips face?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.651
Yes, not exactly overjoyed.

43:24.640 --> 43:28.770
Thanks, Tanya, that's all
went a little further than I had planned.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.445
Really?
Why did not you just say something?

43:31.440 --> 43:33.568
You prevail,
when it comes to wedding planning.

43:33.560 --> 43:37.281
You also have to be with the people
push through. - I know, but me

43:37.280 --> 43:41.763
You are so confident. - But that was
not always like that. Believe me. - no?

43:41.760 --> 43:43.603
No.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.449
Please, do not
the same mistake as me, Daisy.

43:47.440 --> 43:50.091
What happened?

43:50.720 --> 43:52.324
What?

43:53.200 --> 43:56.124
I understand.
That's why you hate weddings so much.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.726
You know,
It's not about me at all.

43:58.720 --> 44:02.850
Come, Tanya! Does she have one?
sitting in front of the altar?

44:06.280 --> 44:10.251
Oh my God!
Tanya, I'm so sorry, really.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.691
That's fine.

44:13.680 --> 44:16.126
Just take care of yourself, okay?

44:17.040 --> 44:19.407
And I take care of you too.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.764
Maybe you should rest a bit.
The many festivals before the wedding

44:22.760 --> 44:25.206
are very exhausting.
- Something comes to mind.

44:25.200 --> 44:28.124
For the brunch that my family
organized tomorrow for the relatives

44:28.120 --> 44:30.282
Do you have something to wear?

44:30.280 --> 44:33.250
I have my black Chanel costume.
- Nope.

44:33.240 --> 44:36.130
That should be a bit more summery.

44:37.320 --> 44:39.163
Here, try this!

44:39.160 --> 44:42.881
I saw it and thought,
that would be great for you.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.008
It would have to fit.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.880
Thank you.
- I thank you.

44:57.120 --> 45:01.170
Guys, do you have to do everything yourself?
Is a disaster!

45:02.480 --> 45:07.168
Where are the flowers that I ordered?
Oh, madam, your hair is a bit higher!

45:10.800 --> 45:12.404
Thank you.

45:15.080 --> 45:19.210
Oh, here comes the bride!

45:20.120 --> 45:22.327
Here comes the bride!

45:25.360 --> 45:26.327
Ciao.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.602
Good morning, Mr. Enigmatic.
- Good morning, Mrs. Judo.

45:34.600 --> 45:38.002
You look exciting.
- Thank you. - And there she goes.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.403
Run away from me again.
Do I talk to myself?

45:42.400 --> 45:45.404
Excuse me, do you have canapÃ©s?
- Yes, ma'am.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.721
They are spicy. Much cayenne in it.

45:48.400 --> 45:51.802
Oh, Henry, you are a natural.
So, what do we have on the plan today?

45:51.800 --> 45:54.007
First, the brunch for the relatives

45:54.000 --> 45:56.970
and then the
Hen party at 5pm.

45:56.960 --> 46:00.760
And the hay cart ride. At 22 o clock.
- Hay Cart?

46:01.520 --> 46:04.888
That will be interesting.
- Do you want some gossip for tea?

46:04.880 --> 46:07.087
Well, and how.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.889
Cousin Eldridge.
Who is sitting in the photo with him?

46:11.280 --> 46:13.248
Is that Leo Simons, the billionaire?

46:13.240 --> 46:16.403
Yes, that's Thompsons
Main competitor in the acquisition.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.523
I think you want to tell me
Cousin Eldridge lives beyond his means

46:20.520 --> 46:23.649
and urgently needs cash.
- He gets 20 giants a month

46:23.640 --> 46:26.041
and needs twice as much.
- Attention, 6 o'clock.

46:26.040 --> 46:31.365
So, Daisy, I have to say
this hors d'oeuvre is interesting.

46:31.360 --> 46:35.968
Thank you. I left the boss
fly in from Maxims for him to prepare.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.601
Glad you like her.
- Oh, who says I like her?

46:39.600 --> 46:42.763
I just said, they are interesting.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.409
What about the mother-in-law?

46:51.400 --> 46:53.323
Do you think she would
to get your hands dirty

46:53.320 --> 46:55.288
so Daisy disappears from the scene?

46:55.280 --> 46:58.727
Well, she has magazine snippets
and a pair of scissors in the bag, though

46:58.720 --> 47:01.291
I do not think so,
that she sent the notes.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.647
I can imagine that she is Daisy
displaced from the country club,

47:03.640 --> 47:05.881
because she is wearing a Dior dress from last year.

47:05.880 --> 47:09.009
But a murderer?
I can not imagine.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.322
Dive? Ciao.

47:12.320 --> 47:16.325
But I only ask
for a small cash injection, nothing more.

47:16.320 --> 47:20.848
Do not forget, this educational fund
Honor the whole Thompson family.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.888
And we are almost bankrupt.

47:22.880 --> 47:26.646
Every penny is now for the takeover
second hand. - quarrel in the vegetable garden.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.802
That's not a good time.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.087
I had to
sell the Nebraska Railway Company,

47:31.080 --> 47:33.606
to have enough cash.
I had to confess to the shareholders

47:33.600 --> 47:36.968
You neglect the family,
and you still regret it.

47:39.800 --> 47:42.770
So what's going on?
Is Aunt Helen angry because of something?

47:42.760 --> 47:47.288
No, she is just a little tense
lately. Everything OK.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.684
Virgin invasion.

47:56.720 --> 48:01.044
Oh, honey!
Would you like to talk to us?

48:02.080 --> 48:04.162
I do not understand. What do you all mean?

48:04.160 --> 48:10.167
Sally says we want you to know
You know, we are so sorry.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.447
What?
- We know about everything.

48:12.440 --> 48:15.489
How you were allowed to sit.

48:15.480 --> 48:19.451
Right at the altar, that's horrible.
- That's so tragic.

48:19.440 --> 48:23.968
Yes, but we want you to know
that we are always there for you.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.131
Let's do it.
- sister hearts.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.202
You are one of us now.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.844
Thank you.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.888
I can not believe
that you have told everyone

48:43.880 --> 48:48.090
I did not tell you that you mean mine
Bodyguard is just what you went through.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.651
Tanya, we are friends.

48:50.640 --> 48:52.881
You have such a heavy burden
but do not wear alone.

48:52.880 --> 48:56.521
Also bodyguards need
a shoulder to cry. - No, listen!

48:56.520 --> 48:59.888
That's not how it works, okay?
You are the client, I am the bodyguard.

48:59.880 --> 49:02.565
You are not here for
to buy me pretty clothes

49:02.560 --> 49:05.086
or sisterly heart pressures
to organize,

49:05.080 --> 49:09.927
and especially not your bridesmaids
to tell my personal problems.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.763
OK. So, what are we doing here now?

49:14.760 --> 49:18.446
Something I unbelievable
find relaxing. I show it to you.

49:18.440 --> 49:24.482
OK, pay attention! We fill
small bags of lavender and roses,

49:24.760 --> 49:28.048
with it the tables
smell good at the wedding afterwards.

49:28.040 --> 49:32.602
Then I tie
a little pink ribbon around and

49:33.320 --> 49:36.051
Voila! Try using!

49:39.160 --> 49:42.323
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I know, I chatted.

49:42.320 --> 49:46.609
This will never happen again.
But what happened at the wedding?

49:47.680 --> 49:51.810
Oh you know,
I was young and completely naive.

49:51.800 --> 49:56.010
And Kevin was attractive.
I should have been startled,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.321
because he always tried
to postpone the wedding date.

49:58.320 --> 50:02.120
But I was so busy
with the wedding,

50:02.120 --> 50:04.646
that I did not notice the signs.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.887
Finally, I stood there
with a bunch of gifts,

50:07.880 --> 50:12.602
which I had to return.
And he left my maid of honor.

50:13.680 --> 50:17.730
Wow! Tanya, I'm really sorry.
- No, alright.

50:17.720 --> 50:22.123
You know what? I think,
Kevin did you a favor.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.763
As the?
- I have a good intuition.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.366
And I think you'll do something better.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.761
I do not know, but okay.

50:32.240 --> 50:35.642
May I give you some advice?
- Do I have another choice?

50:36.360 --> 50:40.570
You have to try to forgive him.

50:40.560 --> 50:44.007
Promise me you'll try.
Tanya, please!

50:44.200 --> 50:46.328
I try it.

50:49.520 --> 50:54.526
I think we both might have one another
judged something too premature, right?

50:55.360 --> 50:57.727
I know,
it is not easy for you to be here

50:57.720 --> 51:03.762
between this wedding stuff and stuff,
but I am glad that you are there.

51:09.120 --> 51:12.169
Tanya, meeting in the Texas room.
- Yes immediately.

51:12.160 --> 51:14.640
Be right back.

51:18.400 --> 51:20.926
<i> Home on the ranch does not mean
I can not find you. </ i></i>

51:20.920 --> 51:23.651
A gardener thought so
outside in a flowerpot.

51:23.640 --> 51:26.564
And this time was also
a cartridge case.

51:26.560 --> 51:29.086
Someone has fun with this game.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.765
That's enough. We say
all activities until the wedding. - What?

51:31.760 --> 51:33.569
Darling, listen!
- Stop with "darling"!

51:33.560 --> 51:37.201
I do not give up because of a stupid letter
on my bachelorette party.

51:37.200 --> 51:39.328
I would even
to crawl through a barbed wire fence,

51:39.320 --> 51:42.881
not to miss the party.
And that's probably all.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.683
Tanya, stay by her side.
Bachelorette party or not,

51:49.680 --> 51:52.650
stick to it!
- We are also with the van

51:52.640 --> 51:56.247
and keep an eye on everything outside.
- I expect you to be back in time.

51:56.240 --> 51:58.481
The hay wagon ride is at ten.

51:58.480 --> 52:01.563
Tanya, comes from a 38s.

52:01.560 --> 52:05.849
Should you be at the party?
Keep that in mind tonight, okay?

52:11.200 --> 52:14.807
I think it's really funny here with you.
Okay, a toast.

52:14.800 --> 52:18.771
On old friends and new!

52:18.760 --> 52:21.001
Cheers!
- Cheers!

52:21.440 --> 52:24.205
Hey, Slim, where is the next round?

52:25.440 --> 52:28.171
I'd like to know,
What Chip and the boys are doing today.

52:28.160 --> 52:31.130
Forget the guys!
This is your bachelorette party.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.964
Betsy is right, Daisy.
This is your last evening in freedom.

52:33.960 --> 52:38.682
Chip makes the best of it,
and I think you should do that as well.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.810
Yes. - I could imagine,
you would be a good Tammy Wynette.

52:42.800 --> 52:45.804
No. I sing? No.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.529
No, I need more fluent courage
to do that.

52:49.520 --> 52:54.242
Bottles up! - Oh, I do not drink that much,
otherwise I'll go crazy.

52:54.680 --> 52:58.127
We are not kindergartners,
you have to take care of. Swallow up!

52:58.120 --> 53:01.010
Yes, I want to see the crazy Tanya.
- Definitely not.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.526
Then you can us
tell a little bit more about Jake.

53:03.520 --> 53:06.524
The guy seems to have done it to you.

53:06.520 --> 53:11.526
Well, I admit, he is very sweet.

53:14.120 --> 53:17.488
You know what?
Now I am making a toast.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.290
I was a little scared,
to be an outsider here.

53:20.280 --> 53:24.330
But you girls have me
really great. Cheers!

53:24.320 --> 53:29.247
Thank you. - Cheers!
- You are now part of the family. Or, girls?

53:29.240 --> 53:31.891
And I'll do the hair for the wedding.
Deal?

53:31.880 --> 53:36.408
She gets a crazy Texas hairstyle,
and that is a promise!

53:37.600 --> 53:39.967
Okay, ladies and gentlemen!

53:39.960 --> 53:43.601
Let's welcome our first karaoke star!
Cowboy Bill!

53:44.400 --> 53:46.801
Hello friends!
I will blow you away

53:46.800 --> 53:50.885
with my guns
and some delicate tones!

53:52.080 --> 53:54.208
Come on, cowboy!

53:55.160 --> 53:57.367
You have a new worshiper.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.330
From tomorrow she is married!
- Hey, shut up!

54:00.320 --> 54:03.767
Come on, sweetheart!
I can not get the sounds alone!

54:03.760 --> 54:06.127
Come on, go up. Enjoy it.

54:06.120 --> 54:09.966
As you say, Tanya,
I lose the freedom.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.530
Excellent!

54:32.560 --> 54:36.963
He can not sing at all.
But with the muscles, what's up?

54:36.960 --> 54:38.849
Be kind, Daisy!

54:58.520 --> 55:00.329
Daisy!

55:06.120 --> 55:10.284
We just danced, Tanya.
- Lady, why are you going for me?

55:10.280 --> 55:14.171
I could not control myself.
They were so good. - Honestly?

55:14.160 --> 55:19.451
Yes. So your song, the movements,
that confused me completely.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.007
You have something from Brad Paisley, I think.

55:22.440 --> 55:26.684
I do not care. Sorry.

55:26.680 --> 55:28.728
Go on!

55:33.440 --> 55:37.081
That was entertaining. - We have just
seen the mad Tanya.

55:37.080 --> 55:42.610
Hey, I'm surprised. For one
KindergÃ¤rtnerin you're pretty taff.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.809
Okay, girls!
You have to lift one more.

55:45.800 --> 55:49.247
We'll meet in an hour
with Chip and the boys.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.962
Good number, Tanya.

55:58.080 --> 56:03.246
Is not that insanely romantic?
- Yes. - A hay cart ride with you all.

56:03.520 --> 56:06.364
Tanya, did you notice
how great are all my friends?

56:06.360 --> 56:08.522
I hope you enjoy yourself.

56:08.520 --> 56:11.729
Hey, little lady, how are you?
- I'm fine, Sheriff.

56:11.720 --> 56:14.200
You just want to cuddle, right?

56:14.760 --> 56:17.366
We do not need to pretend
as if we were a couple.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.488
Glad to hear that.

56:20.600 --> 56:24.730
That's so tragic, darling.
- Listen.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.849
The stock market? Oh thank you.

56:27.840 --> 56:32.528
We went swimming with Nebraska Pacific,
So save your tips, Robbie.

56:32.920 --> 56:36.891
Robbie always desperately tries
getting rid of his stock picks.

56:37.720 --> 56:40.326
You have hay on your hair. Wait!

56:40.320 --> 56:43.961
Look at the lovebirds.
- Daisy.

56:44.680 --> 56:49.402
So, really, these brats are so curious,
that drives me crazy.

56:49.400 --> 56:52.210
So much for the topic
"Maintain myth".

56:52.200 --> 56:55.090
Forget it! It does not work.
- Really?

56:55.320 --> 56:58.563
You seem to be
pretty good on it. - Do you find?

56:58.560 --> 57:01.928
Clear. Law student. No money.

57:01.920 --> 57:04.526
You know, the exterior can be deceiving.

57:05.320 --> 57:09.962
Did you actually know that Daisy and me
were together? - no.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.646
Do you have any reason to hope
that the wedding can not take place?

57:13.640 --> 57:15.961
How so? He is my best friend.

57:16.880 --> 57:20.601
Believe me,
Daisy and Chip are made for each other.

57:21.280 --> 57:24.443
You do not think that his gaze wanders too?
- You know what?

57:24.440 --> 57:27.728
I think we should have the interrogation
finish now, young lady.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.485
Think twice,
before you throw it.

57:30.480 --> 57:33.450
You do not win the war.
- Take your finger away!

57:33.440 --> 57:36.125
I have seen your judo arts
and was not impressed.

57:36.120 --> 57:40.409
Do not do it.
I'm warning you, do not do it. No!

57:41.320 --> 57:44.210
Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace.

57:45.480 --> 57:47.767
Hey, stop!

57:51.640 --> 57:54.246
Was really romantic.
- Was a great carriage ride.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.447
What do we do now?

57:57.600 --> 58:00.080
Do we want to drink something?
- Hey, shut up!

58:00.080 --> 58:03.323
A nightcap?
- I could use a whiskey.

58:03.320 --> 58:07.530
Daisy, sweetheart, just got a package
delivered for you. Here.

58:07.520 --> 58:10.490
This is defined
a special wedding gift for you.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.324
I'm really curious. Grandma Smith?

58:16.520 --> 58:18.409
<i> Till death do us part. Say it off. </ I></i>

58:19.200 --> 58:22.249
Henry, main entrance.
Who gave that?

58:22.560 --> 58:25.689
That was a messenger with a motorcycle.
He is still in front.

58:25.680 --> 58:29.207
Watch out for Daisy!
- Did she just speak with her hand?

59:14.120 --> 59:15.690
Carlo!

59:21.600 --> 59:24.365
We have our husband.
He confessed at once.

59:24.360 --> 59:27.170
But why did he do that?
I do not understand his motive.

59:27.160 --> 59:30.369
That will be shown yet. Important is,
that you caught the guy.

59:30.360 --> 59:32.647
Does anyone have that?
heard of the wedding party?

59:32.640 --> 59:35.041
No, they were all already in there
busy with their drinks.

59:35.040 --> 59:37.202
So, I think
Your camouflage has not been revealed.

59:37.200 --> 59:40.329
But I will give a speech,
so that no doubt arises.

59:40.320 --> 59:43.051
Good, I see,
you have the situation under control,

59:43.040 --> 59:45.646
but by no means
you may let it go. - Yes, sir.

59:45.640 --> 59:48.530
Until the wedding we are on standby.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.250
I want you all to know
how happy we are

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.005
for the first time in several weeks.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.050
Now I am calm.
Now I want to make a toast.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.203
So, fill the glasses!

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.963
It's so hard to believe
that it was Carlo.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.487
He has the simple green tablecloths
spiced up with aqua napkin rings.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.041
Who thinks that someone
with so much taste is a criminal?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.283
Oh, well, who knows
why do people do what they do?

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.725
But no matter. You're doing well?
- Yes.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.849
And I'm really so relieved
that you got him.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.889
Now I can completely relax
focus on my wedding.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.930
Did not you do it before?
- Daisy, darling, please come to me!

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.007
Everyone has? OK.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.005
I would like
to thank a special person.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.765
Of course, next to my beloved daughter,

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.481
namely our bridesmaid
and girlfriend Tanya.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.604
For all who do not know it yet

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.446
Last night
she caught a real party crasher.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.847
Obviously
our little celebration is in high demand.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.004
So we all start together,
on our Tanya!

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.641
On Tanya!
- Cheers!

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.731
And now we enjoy
my daughter's wedding.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.208
I love you darling.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.043
Tanya!

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.560
My buddy Jake is totally on you.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.210
Really? Why are you telling me this?

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.568
I have known Jake since we were five.
I know when he likes someone.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.245
I just wanted to tell you
that I am happy about it.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.130
I do not like him me and Daisy
looks happy all the time

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.125
and even nobody has.
Jake is a good guy.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.922
And what about you?
Really ready to marry?

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.123
There are enough possibilities here
find out.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.809
I sometimes see
pretty girl behind.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.404
But believe me, I have Daisy
never cheated. Not really. No way.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.971
I got used to the idea

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.169
only one woman for the whole
To have life. That's scary.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.130
You should get used to that too,
that means a marriage.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.444
I know.
But I love Daisy. She is everything to me.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.283
She is the only woman for me.
And I always want to be by her side.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.528
If that's really true,
she is a very happy woman.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.162
All the best.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:40.130
Hey, Tanya! Do we want to go to the park?

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.363
I should actually
I should be with Daisy.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.727
Okay, I know
that you and Daisy are good friends,

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.291
but you can not even do it
Leave alone for five minutes?

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.886
I think she can take care of herself.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.081
I want to tell you something.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.762
So, what did you want to tell me?

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.602
You have me all the time
picked up because of my law school.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.126
Now I wanted to clear the table.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.891
So you lied.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.802
I am not a student.
I have never studied law in my life.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.247
I got accepted,
but I did not go. And

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.961
I work in a supermarket.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.126
Where? A double life, why?

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.006
No idea.
I do not have that much coal like that.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.402
That is not completely right. I'm coming
from a wealthy family, but

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.643
I think I just want to do it myself.
do you understand?

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.089
I will study law at some point,
but only if I can pay it myself.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.163
I think that's fantastic.
This shows character and backbone, I think.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.926
I think you are fantastic.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.008
I should go back.
- Oh, wait!

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.289
Why are you always running away from me?
Because I should be with Daisy.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.763
I promise you, Daisy is doing very well.
But you are in serious danger.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.931
How so?
- You miss your luck.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.487
Henry, shots at the south entrance!

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.731
What's going on here?
- Did not something happen to anyone?

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.002
Daisy, all right?
- Yes.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.085
Where were you? Daisy, are you hurt?

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.526
No, I'm fine. I heard
the shots and ducked me. - Good Good.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.091
Did something happen to someone?

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.291
They should protect Daisy. - I know.
I'm sorry. I was only in the park with Jake.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.124
My daughter is almost shot
because you were flirting in the park!

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.282
What kind of bodyguard are you?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.246
That makes no sense.
- All right, darling?

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.050
You are a bodyguard?

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.240
Tanya!
- Did he escape?

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.242
There is nobody in or out of the property.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.164
It has to be someone
that's already in here. Did you see something?

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.642
No. I did not see anything.
Go through everything. - Well.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.642
I want answers right now.
Whoever says you are the best,

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.689
They screwed up.
Out with the language! - Sir,

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.160
can we clarify that in private?
- You can forget that.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.969
I want answers!
Who did you exclude?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.406
Who is suspicious?
What are you actually imagining?

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.007
Someone wanted to murder Daisy.
I want to know everything now. Immediately!

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.401
Listen! At first I thought,
it would be Bosworth,

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.404
but in time did not skinny.
Constance seemed suspicious

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:53.644
but then I caught Chip
with the staff, and I thought - What?

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.849
What? You have a chip
seen with an employee?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.842
Not really.
- Not really?

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.606
Why did not you tell me?
I thought we were friends.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.164
Let's see if other security companies
do their job better.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.401
Lady, you are fired!

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.611
It can neither Constance
still be Bosworth.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.364
We have them on the video all the time.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.284
And here is the video clip
of the other night.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.850
Chip and the employee.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.810
Looks like chip really
would have lost his contact lens.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.566
I was wrong.
I was completely wrong with everything!

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.363
I can not believe it,
I disregarded the simplest basic rule.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.682
Get away from emotions
do not obscure the view.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.361
Can you please make sure
that Daisy sees the tape,

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.126
So she knows that Chip did not do anything?
I go home.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.005
<i> And of course we expect you too
are again numerous this summer. </ i></i>

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.686
<i> But now for the wedding,
everyone is talking about right now. </ i></i>

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.648
<i> Of course, our holly is there. </ i></i>

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.120
<i> Yes, and the surprise
the day is for all of us, </ i></i>

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.442
<i> That the wedding of Daisy Thompson and
Chip Denver has been postponed to tomorrow. </ I></i>

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.603
<i> This blue-blooded wedding was planned
yes for today. </ i></i>

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.921
<i> But then you decided
to move it. </ i></i>

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.969
<i> And although the bride is practically up close
surrounded by bodyguards, </ i></i>

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.725
<i> speaks for everything
that it will be a great day for them. </ i></i>

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.006
<i> Back to the studio. </ i></i>

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.770
<i> I'm not there.
Please leave a message. </ I></i>

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:37.961
<i> Hi, it's me, Daisy. I wanted to tell you,
that I'm sorry how everything went. </ i></i>

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.691
<i> Call me. Bye. </ I></i>

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.880
I have a new order.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.326
I just want to see how you're doing.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.411
Outstanding. You can see that.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.089
A completely normal day.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.128
Are you telling me
why you want to break my joints?

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.805
I only have to
reduce some excess energy.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.206
Come on, Tanya!
Calm down, for God's sake.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.650
Free up a few days.
Fly to the Bahamas or something.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.564
I'm getting fit
for the next fight, okay?

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.881
I am worried.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.202
What do you want here?
- Why did not you call back?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.764
I have ... you
leave a dozen messages.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.524
I thought you were evil,
because I was not honest. That's it.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.524
Then I'm just as guilty
because I was not honest either.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.683
Jake, why are you here?
- Because Daisy needs you.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.286
Okay, Henry showed her the tape.
She knows that nothing happened

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:58.203
between Chip and this girl.
Where is the problem?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.649
She wants to talk to you, Tanya. - I think,
I built enough crap with her.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.529
Then clean him up again.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.524
I can not, okay? I have to train.
- All right, train!

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.689
Well, go!
Of course you also suspected me.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.321
Why not?
After all, I was not honest with you.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:21.368
You just did your job.
I got that.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:25.921
Besides, I'm here
because the wedding takes place as planned.

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:30.120
And I want to,
that you accompany me as my partner.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.087
Listen, Jake!
I think you're a really nice guy, okay?

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.845
But I'm a security agent,
and I messed up an order.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.046
I do not know if you know
What that means for me.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.602
This has never happened to me. I want
get my life back in gear.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:53.163
Focus on the work and try
to get everything else out of my head!

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:58.246
Got it? - Do you have the philosophy
also heeded two years ago?

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.084
Did that make you happy, Tanya?
- Get lost!

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.401
Tanya! Hey wait!

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.844
Daisy asked me to give you that.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.681
She said you would understand.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.530
Something, how important it is to forgive.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.285
Listen,
you can go to the wedding because of Daisy,

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.965
who would like to have you as a friend.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.488
Or you go with me.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.690
Tell Daisy that I would like to congratulate her.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.484
Hi, I will not stay long.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.970
Tanya?
- Hi Kevin.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.804
Wow, I have not seen you since, since
- It's been a while.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.521
Are you doing well?
- A little older, but not necessarily wiser.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.091
You look great.
- Thank you.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.924
I heard,
you are a special agent or something?

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.807
Do not believe everything you hear.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.003
So that's your own restaurant now.
You have done yourself.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.891
Yes, I have three restaurants,
but most of the time I spend in the kitchen.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.963
And what brings you here?

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.601
Oh, my mother told me
from your new restaurant.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.288
I just wanted to congratulate you.
I have a little gift.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.762
Thank you. It will not explode, right?

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.208
When aprons explode
- Thank you.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.162
You want to marry?
- Yes, crazy.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.811
I am happy for you.
- Thank you.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.489
I have to go.
And I wish you the best of luck.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.007
Tanya, wait! You're welcome! It

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.686
I'm really sorry for what happened.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.162
What is beautiful
a small forgiveness among friends?

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.968
Glad to be happy.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.601
Do not you want to stay for dinner?
I make a stunning fish soup.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.490
No thanks.
I meet up with friends.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.888
Then at least take a fresh muffin.
On the go. You're welcome.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.685
Oh, please, do not tell me this is a bug.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.162
No, that's a mustard seed.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.245
Are you allergic?
I'm sorry. I did not know

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.926
No. No. Excuse me

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.565
That is a long story. Thank you.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.249
Oh, Henry

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.244
Bright sunshine.
- That's Kelly and Ron.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.208
I do not know. Yes, perhaps.
- I am not sure.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.365
Oh my God,
This eyeshadow is really tremendous to you.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.921
Yes exactly. And look
the veil on, just stunning.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.481
Many Thanks.
I do not know if I can handle it.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.371
Oh darling, I know what you're missing.
Once together. - Yes.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.204
I wish Tanya was here.
- How so? She just made trouble, Daisy.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.046
Do not forget, this is your special day
and everything is perfect.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.922
I know, but somehow - I'm sorry
all this hype about the wedding.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.844
I mean, the security issues,
but now we are - No, Daddy,

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.129
That's not it. It is Tanya.
She is my girlfriend.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.528
Oh my God,
I hope that's not the bridegroom.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.127
Who's there?
- Jake. - Should come in.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.924
Hi.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.731
Somebody wants to talk to you.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.204
You?
We do not need your services anymore.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.202
We met other arrangements.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.728
I can assure you, Mr Thompson,
I'm really private here.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.965
Well, I'm here exactly
How should I say, for my girlfriend.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.004
Tanya, I am so happy that you are here.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.530
Oh, that's nice to hear.
I got three tickets,

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:33.603
to be here in time.
- My make-up is over.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.646
You were right with me
protect and control my feelings.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:43.090
I'm sorry.
And even though I really hate weddings,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.800
I wanted on your very special day
but like to be there.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.566
Besides, someone once told me
to be that bridesmaid

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.121
it is a sacred duty and an honor.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.005
Thank you, Tanya.
But I do not know if that's right.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.449
Daisy! Hey, Chip did not do anything.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.887
Henry saw the videos.
I was completely wrong.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.611
Yes, but I heard
how you talked about it,

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.241
that he looks after other girls and
- Did you hear the whole conversation?

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.403
Because then Chip told me
that he is only in love with you.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.324
And that's it all over the world
no other girl for him.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.563
And that only he
want to be with you.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.929
And I believe him.
- Do you really mean? - Yes.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.604
Darling, we have to!
- no.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.288
Not without my new bridesmaid.
- Agreed.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.887
You are really the biggest.

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.005
Is he crying?
- I told you, he's a softie.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.970
Keep your mouth shut! I have only one allergy.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.008
Hey, are you crying?
Do not think about what happened to you.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.802
I do not do that. It's because

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.770
I'm just happy for my girlfriend.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.326
It is so far. The big moment.
And I am bursting with pride.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:00.162
Ready?
- Yes, ready, Daddy. Still waiting.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.448
What is it, honey? Are you not feeling well?

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.329
You do not get cold feet because of Chip.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.360
If you do, you just have to say it.
- No, daddy. Everything is perfect.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.522
Well. Do not worry
because of uninvited guests.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.286
The property is surrounded.
Nobody comes in here who should not get in.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:25.127
I think they are already waiting for us two.
- Okay, Daddy. Let's go.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.846
Dear bridal couple, we are today
in the name of God,

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.764
around this young couple
to accompany in the state of marriage.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.446
Daisy and Chip are a couple,
that is made for each other.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.205
And this is a happy day for the two.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.090
<i> The stock market? Oh, thank you. </ I></i>

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:11.529
<i> We went swimming with Nebraska Pacific,
So save your tips, Robbie. </ i></i>

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.965
<i> I had to
sell the Nebraska Railway Company, </ i></i>

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.327
<i> to have enough cash.
I had to get the shareholders, </ i></i>

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.367
<i> you can not imagine that. </ i></i>

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.481
And now, Daisy will take the vow
that she wrote herself.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.370
<i> Betsy Monroe. It is practical
America's aristocracy. Filthy rich. </ I></i>

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:32.965
My beloved chip

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.450
<i> Just take Betsy there as an example. </ i></i>

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.410
<i> Did you know that she and Chip
were in college together? </ i></i>

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.324
<i> But she had left him first,
until she knows his name. </ i></i>

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.051
And I swear to love you always

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.283
through all the sun's rays
and thunderstorms of our lives.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.288
<i> Madam, madam, your hair is a bit higher! </ i></i>

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.004
<I> Carlo. </ I>

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:04.242
And I solemnly swear,
always only to love you.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.481
<i> Your family owns companies
who make just about anything, </ i></i>

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.970
<i> from watches to wedding cakes. </ i></i>

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.642
If someone has reasons to

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.246
why these two
not to marry,

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.449
Now talk or be silent forever.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.364
All men down! Come on! Get down!

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.405
What's going on there?

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.241
Betsy!
Someone has to stop them! Stop them!

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.526
I do not believe that.
You really wanted to kill me?

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.285
Why not?
You ruined my life, Daisy.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.489
You're the one who gets chip,
and you do not need his money at all.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.484
But me,
since your dad ruined my family.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.165
You get everything, and I can not get anything!

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.210
But, Betsy, we swore
Being girlfriends for life.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.249
Yes.
- But that's over!

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.487
What was that?

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.722
Left hook.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.043
Kind. Very nice.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.004
I hereby declare you
to husband and wife.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.202
Really a perfect day.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.405
Say, all weddings are with you
as bridesmaid as exciting as this?

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.564
No. Only the ones you are with.
- How could I ask?

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.761
Okay, everyone's listening!
We would like to toast with you now.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.884
But first I want to ask Tanya
to read something,

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.168
that's me special
for Chip and me wrote.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.730
No. - Do it, do it, do it.
- You really want me to do that?

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.609
I want.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.963
What is love?

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.130
It is the feeling
when I see magenta clouds

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.521
and they fill me with joy.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:35.526
I discover bright yellow daffodils
and bath in their golden splendor.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.889
I watch the dancing butterfly
and feel his freedom.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.968
I dance, I dance, I dance
on the bliss of life.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.846
Just like unicorns
accompany me in my joy,

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:51.003
like rainbow
to illuminate our common path,

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.767
I know that the feelings,
that I share with my love,

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.921
will continue,

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.400
our whole life.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.368
My lady.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.924
OK. One last question.
Then I will stop. - Tell me!

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.884
Are you now
cured of your wedding phobia?

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:31.487
No bad memories anymore
the last time,

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.405
no lasting guilt feelings?

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.407
Should I be completely honest?

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.967
I want to now
in no place in this world would you rather be

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:46.681
to dance here with you
- Oh, my God, beware!

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:02.126
You did that on purpose.
- Trapped is trapped.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.450
By now Betsy confessed everything.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.171
The instigation of the wedding planner,
the threats

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:18.484
What was with Carlo? - Betsy has Carlo
just wrapped around the little finger.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.721
She pretended to him
that she had fallen in love with him,

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.768
and he fell for it.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.127
They will both be long for a while
disappear from the scene.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.044
Wow, American Royalty!
What are they going to do next?

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.682
Let's work, maybe. Cousin Eldridge
has at least given up his playboy life.

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.207
That's why he's with the
Takeover alums hit by Thompson.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.170
That's good for him.
Hey, what about Constance?

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.051
I never found out why
this scissors carries in her bag.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.124
One of our boys
you followed her into a shop.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.090
Obviously, she collects coupons.
- Really?

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.481
One of America's richest women
collect coupons? - Yes.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.404
In fact, she is one
of America's poorest women.

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.009
Crazy world.
- Yes, oh no matter.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.321
It's just important
that the wedding was saved

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.369
and you're back to your job.
- Yes.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.681
Do you want to learn a little secret?
- Clear.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.322
I was at Chesterton,
and just like you, I am now a partner.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.206
How nice.
Then I'll see you on Monday morning

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.521
fresh and lively at the partner meeting.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.480
No, I'll take a few days off
and I will recover.

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.482
You will not start now,
to spare me?

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.768
Oh no, do not hope.
I think I earned holidays.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:31.288
What? Vacation? You?
- Yes. You know, just put your legs up,

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.329
from time to time
to pick up a good book

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.482
A good book?

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.688
Have fun.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.886
See you. - Bye.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.325
Thank you.
