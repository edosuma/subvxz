♪ My love, she is my world ♪

00:31.907 --> 00:35.502
Such sweet music
shows your blood to be afire.

00:35.619 --> 00:38.463
Why wait we
on stale custom for consummation?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.962
Oh, yes! Tonight's the night.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.176
Would you enter, bold sir?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.143
Oh, I would.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.816
Lilith, this cannot be
the home of one so beautiful.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.114
Forgive me, this is foul.

01:04.188 --> 01:05.987
Shh.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.990
Sad words suit not
upon a lover's tongue.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.037
Your kiss transformed me.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.165
A suitor should meet
his beloved's parents.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.167
Mother Doomfinger.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.263
And Mother Bloodtide.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.696
Soon, at the hour of woven words,

01:44.813 --> 01:49.865
we shall rise again
and this ﬂeeting Earth will perish!

02:34.279 --> 02:36.998
But how do you travel in time?
What makes it go?

02:37.074 --> 02:39.327
Oh, let's take the fun
and the mystery out of everything.

02:39.409 --> 02:43.334
Martha, you don't want to know.
It just does. Hold on tight!

02:45.916 --> 02:48.510
Blimey! Do you have to pass a test
to fly this thing?

02:48.585 --> 02:51.304
Yes, and If ailed.
Now, make the most of it.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.678
I promised you one trip
and one trip only.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.851
Outside this door,

02:56.802 --> 02:58.224
brave new world.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.305
Where are we?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.391
Take a look.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.773
After you.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.614
Oh, you're kidding me.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.742
You're so kidding me!

03:15.821 --> 03:19.291
Oh, my God, we did it!
We travelled in time!

03:21.451 --> 03:23.749
Where are we? No, sorry.

03:23.829 --> 03:27.550
Got to get used to
this whole new language. When are we?

03:27.624 --> 03:30.173
- Mind out.
- Garde a' l'eau!

03:30.293 --> 03:34.139
Somewhere before the invention
of the toilet. Sorry about that.

03:34.256 --> 03:37.681
I've seen worse.
I worked the late-night shift, A&E.

03:37.801 --> 03:41.396
But are we safe?
I mean, can we move around and stuff?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.099
- Of course we can. Why do you ask?
- It's like in the films.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.561
You step on a butterfly,
you change the future of the human race.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.113
Tell you what, then.
Don't step on any butterflies.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.528
What have butterflies ever done to you?

03:52.607 --> 03:54.735
What if... I don't know.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.571
- What if I kill my grandfather?
- Are you planning to?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.327
- No.
- Well, then.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.660
- And this is London?
- Think so.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.373
Round about, um, ooh, 1599.

04:06.872 --> 04:09.295
Oh, but hold on. Am I all right?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.502
I'm not going to get carted off
as a slave, am I?

04:11.626 --> 04:12.923
Why would they do that?

04:13.044 --> 04:15.012
Not exactly white,
in case you haven't noticed.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.928
I'm not even human. just walk about
like you own the place. Works for me.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.601
Besides, you'd be surprised.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.181
Elizabethan England,
not so different from your time.

04:24.848 --> 04:28.022
Look over there. They've got recycling.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.273
A water cooler moment.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.447
And the Earth
will be consumed by flame!

04:36.526 --> 04:40.201
Global warming.
Oh, yes, and entertainment.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.620
Popular entertainment for the masses.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.249
If I'm right, we're just down the river
by Southwark.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.371
Right next to...

04:50.207 --> 04:51.629
Oh, yes!

04:51.958 --> 04:54.381
The Globe Theatre!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.259
Brand-new, just opened.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.181
Though, strictly speaking,
it's not a globe.

04:58.256 --> 05:02.136
It's a tetradecagon, 14 sides,
containing the man himself.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.264
Whoa, you don't mean...

05:05.347 --> 05:07.975
- Is Shakespeare in there?
- Oh, yes.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.311
Miss Jones, will you accompany me
to the theatre?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.395
Mr Smith, I will!

05:12.521 --> 05:15.320
When you get home, you can tell everyone
you've seen Shakespeare.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.696
Then I could get sectioned.

05:39.923 --> 05:44.144
That's amazing, just amazing.
It's worth putting up with the smell.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.686
And those are men
dressed as women, yeah?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.938
London never changes.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.313
Where's Shakespeare?
I want to see Shakespeare!

05:54.396 --> 05:56.239
Author! Author!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.613
Do people shout that?
Do they shout "Author"?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.781
Author! Author!

06:00.861 --> 06:04.331
Author! Author!

06:04.447 --> 06:05.790
Well,

06:07.534 --> 06:09.457
they do now.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.081
- Author!
- Author!

06:22.257 --> 06:24.009
Author! Author!

06:24.134 --> 06:25.386
Author!

06:25.886 --> 06:27.559
Author!

06:29.347 --> 06:32.271
He's a bit different to his portraits.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.089
Genius. He's a genius, the genius.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.384
The most human human there's ever been.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.678
Now, we're gonna hear him speak.

06:59.753 --> 07:04.759
Always, he chooses the best words.
New, beautiful, brilliant words.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.346
Oh, shut your big, fat mouths!

07:12.307 --> 07:14.935
- Oh, well.
- You should never meet your heroes.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.022
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.693
Oh, that's a wig.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.702
Wind the craft of ancient harm.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.747
The time approaches for our charm.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.870
I know what you're all saying,

07:29.950 --> 07:32.794
"Love's Labour's Lost;
that's a funny ending, isn't it?"

07:32.869 --> 07:36.715
It just stops.
Will the boys get the girls?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.964
Well, don't get your hose in a tangle.
You'll find out soon.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.636
When?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.590
Yeah, yeah. All in good time.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.641
You don't rush a genius.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.481
When?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.730
Tomorrow night.

08:00.063 --> 08:04.193
The premier of my brand-new play,
a sequel, no less.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.950
And I call it Love's Labour's Won.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.341
I'm not an expert, but I've never heard
of Love's Labour's Won.

08:19.416 --> 08:23.671
Exactly. The lost play.
Doesn't exist. I mean, rumours.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.723
It's mentioned in lists of his plays,
but never ever turns up,

08:26.798 --> 08:28.926
and no one knows why.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.178
Have you got a mini-disc or something?

08:31.302 --> 08:34.932
We can tape it, we can ﬂog it.
Sell it when we get home, make a mint.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.482
No.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.273
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.772
How come it disappeared
in the first place?

08:41.895 --> 08:43.739
Well...

08:44.441 --> 08:48.366
Oh, I was just going to give you
a quick little trip in the Tardis,

08:48.445 --> 08:51.324
but I suppose
we could stay a bit longer.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.807
Here you go, Will, drink up.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.806
There's enough beer in
this lodgings house to sink the Spanish.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.979
Dolly Bailey, you've saved my life.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.848
I'll do more than that later tonight.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.730
And you, girl, hurry up with the tasks.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.903
The talk of gentlemen's
best not overheard.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.446
Yeah, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.821
You must be mad, Will.
Love's Labour's Won? We're not ready.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.028
It's supposed to be next week.
What made you say that?

09:29.152 --> 09:30.654
You haven't even finished it yet.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.956
I've just got the final scene to go.
You'll get it by morning.

09:33.031 --> 09:37.707
Hello! Excuse me. Not interrupting,
am I? Mr Shakespeare, isn't it?

09:37.827 --> 09:40.171
Oh, no, no, no. Who let you in?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.999
No autographs. No, you can't
have yourself sketched with me,

09:43.083 --> 09:45.381
and please don't ask
where I get my ideas from.

09:45.460 --> 09:49.055
Thanks for the interest.
Now be a good boy and shove...

09:50.465 --> 09:52.843
Hey, nonny, nonny!

09:52.967 --> 09:54.640
Sit right down here, next to me.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.768
You two get sewing on them costumes.
Off you go.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.397
Come on, lads. I think
our William's found his new muse.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.316
Sweet lady.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.407
Such unusual clothes.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.860
So fitted.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.455
Erm, verily, forsooth, egads!

10:13.530 --> 10:15.874
No, no, don't do that.

10:17.534 --> 10:21.664
I'm Sir Doctor of Tardis, and this is
my companion, Miss Martha Jones.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.795
Interesting.
That bit of paper, it's blank.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.501
Oh, that's...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.004
Very clever, that proves it.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.680
- Absolute genius.
- Hmm.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.634
No, it says right there, "Sir Doctor
and Martha Jones." It says so.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.468
I say it's blank.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.898
Psychic paper. Um... Long story.
Oh, I hate starting from scratch.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.563
Psychic? I've never heard that before,
and words are my trade.

10:42.642 --> 10:47.022
Who are you exactly? More to the point,
who is your delicious blackamoor lady?

10:47.105 --> 10:48.607
- What did you say?
- Whoops.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.200
Isn't that a word we use nowadays?

10:51.276 --> 10:54.621
An Ethiop girl, a swarth,
a Queen of Afric?

10:54.696 --> 10:57.620
- I can't believe I'm hearing this.
- It's political correctness gone mad.

10:57.740 --> 11:01.335
Martha's from a far off land, Freedonia.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.834
Excuse me. Hold hard a moment.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.336
This is abominable behaviour.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.464
A new play with no warning.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.046
I demand to see a script,
Mr Shakespeare.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.223
As Master of the Revels,

11:13.298 --> 11:16.017
every new script
must be registered at my office

11:16.092 --> 11:19.266
and examined by me
before it can be performed.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.305
Tomorrow morning, first thing,
I'll send it round.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.855
I don't work to your schedule,
you work to mine.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.524
- The script, now!
- I can't.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.026
Then tomorrow's performance
is cancelled.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.607
It's all go around here, isn't it?

11:30.690 --> 11:33.113
I'm returning to my office
for a banning order.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.282
If it's the last thing I do,

11:35.361 --> 11:38.331
Love's Labour's Won
will never be played.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.963
Ooh! Sorry, sir.
Begging your pardon, sir.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.587
Mind you don't hurt
that handsome head of yours.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.667
Hold hard, wanton woman!

11:50.877 --> 11:52.800
I shall return later.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.394
Oh, my mothers.

12:04.474 --> 12:08.104
There's one seeks to stop
the performance tomorrow.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.813
But it must be tomorrow!

12:09.896 --> 12:12.649
Love? Labour? Won must be performed.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.200
Fear not.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.619
Chant with me.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.623
Water damps the fiercest flame.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.668
Drowns down girls and boys the same.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.716
Well then, mystery solved.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.842
That's Love's Labour's Won
over and done with.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.726
I thought it might be something,
you know, more mysterious.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.360
Help me!

13:02.615 --> 13:05.585
- It's that Lynley bloke.
- What's wrong with him?

13:05.702 --> 13:09.332
- Leave it to me, I'm a doctor.
- So am I. Near enough.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.594
Now to halt the vital part.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.635
- Stab the flesh!
- Stop the heart.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.553
Eternal sleep is thine.

13:27.807 --> 13:32.563
Can't get the heart going. Mr Lynley!
Come on. Can you hear me?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.398
You're gonna be all right.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.818
What the hell is that?

13:38.901 --> 13:43.577
I've never seen a death like it.
His lungs are full of water. He drowned.

13:44.157 --> 13:48.207
I don't know, like a blow to the heart.
A visible blow.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.922
Good mistress, this poor fellow has died
from a sudden imbalance of the humours.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.005
A natural, if unfortunate, demise.
Call the constable, have him taken away.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.431
- Yes, sir.
- I'll do it, ma'am.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.683
Why are you telling them that?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.722
This lot have still got
one foot in the Dark Ages.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.267
If I tell them the truth, they'll panic
and think it was witchcraft.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.773
Okay, what was it, then?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.479
Witchcraft.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.649
The potion is prepared.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.826
Now, take it.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.660
Magic words
for the playwright's fevered mind.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.658
Shakespeare will release us.

14:26.741 --> 14:30.621
The mind of a genius
will unlock the tide of blood.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.667
Upon this night, the work is done.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.801
A muse to pen Love's Labour's Won.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.608
I got you a room, Sir Doctor.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.562
You and Miss Jones
are just across the landing.

14:55.645 --> 14:59.149
Poor Lynley. So many strange events.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.827
Not least of all, this land of Freedonia
where a woman can be a doctor.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.538
Where a woman can be what she likes.

15:05.655 --> 15:09.910
And you, Sir Doctor.
How can a man so young have eyes so old?

15:09.992 --> 15:12.040
I do a lot of reading.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.914
A trite reply, yeah? That's what I do.

15:16.541 --> 15:20.762
And you, you look at him
like you're surprised he exists.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.011
He's as much of a puzzle to you
as he is to me.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.677
I think we should say good night.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.021
I must to work.
I have a play to complete.

15:35.852 --> 15:39.447
I'll get my answers tomorrow, Doctor,
and I'll discover more about you

15:39.522 --> 15:42.992
and why this constant performance
of yours.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.365
All the world's a stage.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.872
Hmm. I might use that.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.704
Good night, Doctor.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.911
Nighty-night, Shakespeare.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.967
It's not exactly five star, is it?

16:04.046 --> 16:06.094
Oh, it'll do. I've seen worse.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.269
- I haven't even got a toothbrush.
- Ooh, um...

16:10.970 --> 16:13.064
Contains Venusian spearmint.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.396
So, who's going where?
I mean, there's only one bed.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.649
We'll manage. Come on.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.988
So, magic and stuff. That's a surprise.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.195
It's all a bit Harry Potter.

16:27.278 --> 16:31.283
Wait till you read book seven.
Oh, I cried!

16:31.365 --> 16:34.790
But is it real, though? I mean, witches,
black magic and all that, it's real?

16:34.869 --> 16:37.588
- Course it isn't!
- Well, how am I supposed to know?

16:37.663 --> 16:40.291
I've only just started believing in
time travel. Give me a break.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.923
Looks like witchcraft, but it isn't.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.347
It can't be.
Are you gonna stand there all night?

16:51.886 --> 16:53.980
Budge up a bit, then.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.941
Sorry, there's not much room.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.441
Us two here, same bed. Tongues will wag.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.318
There's such a thing as psychic energy,

17:02.396 --> 17:04.694
but a human
couldn't channel it like that.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.696
Not without a generator
the size of Taunton,

17:06.776 --> 17:09.655
and I think we'd have spotted that. No.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.784
There's something I'm missing, Martha.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.958
Something really close.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.501
It's staring me right in the face,
and I can't see it.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.300
Rose would know.

17:29.173 --> 17:33.553
A friend of mine, Rose, right now
she'd say exactly the right thing.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.642
Still, can't be helped.
You're a novice, never mind.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.733
I'll take you back home tomorrow.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.234
Great!

18:36.949 --> 18:40.544
Bind the mind and take the man.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.623
Speed the words

18:44.415 --> 18:46.463
to writer's hand.

19:29.877 --> 19:34.348
Will, I finished cleaning,
just in time for your special treat.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.972
Oh, aye. I'm not the first, then.

19:39.261 --> 19:44.188
I'll take that to aid my flight
and you shall speak no more this night.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.117
What?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.033
What was that?

20:00.074 --> 20:01.951
Her heart gave out.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.961
She died of fright.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.458
Doctor?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.506
What did you see?

20:07.581 --> 20:09.083
A witch.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.058
Oh, sweet Dolly Bailey.

20:18.134 --> 20:22.640
She sat out three bouts of the plague
in this place. We all ran like rats.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.147
But what could have scared her so?
She had such enormous spirit.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.320
Rage, rage,
against the dying of the light.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.276
I might use that.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.107
You can't, it's someone else's.

20:33.190 --> 20:37.320
But the thing is, Lynley drowned
on dry land, Dolly died of fright

20:37.403 --> 20:40.282
- and they were both connected to you.
- You're accusing me?

20:40.364 --> 20:44.665
No, but I saw a witch, big as you like,
flying, cackling away,

20:44.744 --> 20:47.372
- and you've written about witches.
- I have? When was that?

20:47.455 --> 20:49.298
Not... Not quite yet.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.796
- Peter Streete spoke of witches.
- Who's Peter Streete?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.924
Our builder.
He sketched the plans for the Globe.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.596
The architect?

20:56.338 --> 20:59.638
Hold on. The architect. The architect!
The Globe! Come on!

21:01.427 --> 21:04.431
Columns there, right, and 14 sides.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.770
I've always wondered,
but I've never asked.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.351
Tell me, Will, why 14 sides?

21:08.434 --> 21:11.062
It was the shape Peter Streete
thought best, that's all.

21:11.145 --> 21:14.274
- He said it carried the sound well.
- 14?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.567
Why does that ring a bell? 14?

21:16.650 --> 21:20.075
- There's 14 lines in a sonnet.
- So there is.

21:20.154 --> 21:23.499
Good point. Words and shapes
following the same design.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.622
14 lines, 14 sides, 14 facets...
My head!

21:25.701 --> 21:27.669
Tetradecagon, think, think, think!

21:27.745 --> 21:30.419
- Words, letters, numbers, lines!
- This is just a theatre!

21:30.498 --> 21:33.092
Oh, yeah,
but a theatre's magic, isn't it?

21:33.167 --> 21:35.795
You should know.
You stand on this stage,

21:35.878 --> 21:38.973
say the right words with
the right emphasis at the right time.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.426
Oh, you can make men weep

21:41.550 --> 21:43.598
or cry with joy.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.771
Change them.

21:46.514 --> 21:50.519
You can change peoples' minds
just with words in this place.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.647
And if you exaggerate that...

21:54.730 --> 21:58.280
It's like your police box. Small,
wooden box with all that power inside.

21:58.359 --> 22:03.490
Oh! Oh, Martha Jones, I like you.
Tell you what, Peter Streete would know.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.041
- Can I talk to him?
- You won't get an answer.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.539
A month after finishing this place,
he lost his mind.

22:08.619 --> 22:09.996
Why, what happened?

22:10.079 --> 22:12.958
He started raving about witches,
hearing voices, babbling.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.641
- His mind was addled.
- Where is he now?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.214
- Bedlam.
- What's Bedlam?

22:16.293 --> 22:19.638
- Bethlem Hospital, the madhouse.
- We gotta go there, right now. Come on!

22:19.755 --> 22:23.259
Wait, I'm coming with you.
I want to witness this at first hand.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.640
Ralph! The last scene, as promised.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.559
Copy it, hand it around,
learn it, speak it.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.187
Back before curtain up,
and remember, kid, project!

22:30.266 --> 22:34.237
Eyes and teeth.
You never know, the Queen might turn up.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.279
As if. She never does.

22:38.148 --> 22:42.449
So, tell me of Freedonia, where women
can be doctors, writers, actors.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.867
This country's ruled by a woman.

22:43.946 --> 22:47.871
Ah, she's royal, that's God's business.
Though you are a royal beauty.

22:47.950 --> 22:51.830
Whoa, nelly! I know for a fact
you've got a wife in the country.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.251
But, Martha, this is town.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.458
Come on,
we can all have a good flirt later!

22:55.583 --> 22:57.961
Is that a promise, Doctor?

22:58.085 --> 23:02.261
Oh, 57 academics just punched the air.
Now, move!

23:05.634 --> 23:07.432
Love's Labour's Won.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.889
I don't think much of sequels,
they're never as good as the original.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.349
Have you seen this last bit?

23:11.473 --> 23:14.317
Must have been dozing off when he wrote
that. I don't even know what it means.

23:14.435 --> 23:18.235
Well, that goes for most of his stuff.
Ah, but at least it's my speech.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.400
I get centre stage.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.613
"The light of Shadmoch's hollow moon"

23:25.738 --> 23:27.991
"doth shine on to a point in space,"

23:28.073 --> 23:30.292
"betwixt Dravidian shore..."

23:33.954 --> 23:35.922
What was that?

23:35.998 --> 23:41.346
"...Dravidian shores,
linear 5-9-3-0-1-6..."

23:42.171 --> 23:44.845
A spirit stirs the ether.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.223
But too soon, too soon!

23:49.261 --> 23:51.355
Not to fear, my mothers.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.984
'Tis merely a rehearsal
of what's to come.

23:57.144 --> 24:01.024
"...and strikes the fulsome grove
of Rexel 4."

24:03.692 --> 24:05.444
By all the saints.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.413
It's a spirit.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.034
It's a vile shade.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.961
I think we should never
speak of this again.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.797
Else we'll end up in Bedlam ourselves.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.517
Please, please!

24:32.596 --> 24:36.100
Does my lord Doctor wish
some entertainment while he waits?

24:36.225 --> 24:39.320
I can whip these madmen.
They'll put on a good show for you.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.319
- Bandog and Bedlam.
- No, I don't.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.242
Well, wait here, my lords,
while I, uh...

24:45.317 --> 24:47.740
Make him decent for the lady.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.663
So this is what you call
a hospital, yeah?

24:49.738 --> 24:52.207
Where the patients are whipped
to entertain the gentry?

24:52.282 --> 24:56.287
- And you put your friend in here?
- Oh, it's all so different in Freedonia.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.507
But you're clever! Do you honestly think
this place is any good?

24:59.581 --> 25:01.379
I've been mad, I've lost my mind.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.337
Fear of this place set me right again.
Serves its purpose.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.344
- Mad in what way?
- You lost your son.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.892
My only boy. The Black Death took him.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.761
I wasn't even there.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.308
- I didn't know, I'm sorry.
- Made me question everything.

25:14.430 --> 25:18.435
The futility of this fleeting existence,
to be or not to be.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.441
Oh, that's quite good.

25:21.937 --> 25:26.363
- You should write that down.
- Hmm, maybe not. A bit pretentious?

25:26.442 --> 25:28.365
This way, my lord.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.983
They can be dangerous, my lord.
Don't know their own strength.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.721
I think it helps if you don't whip them.
Now, get out!

25:54.595 --> 25:55.847
Peter.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.266
Peter Streete.

25:59.349 --> 26:03.149
He's the same as he was.
You'll get nothing out of him.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.823
Peter.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.035
What is this?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.413
I must see!

26:22.539 --> 26:24.257
That stranger...

26:25.000 --> 26:27.549
He was at the inn with Shakespeare.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.051
I thought then
he smelt of something new.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.474
Now he visits the madhouse.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.472
The architect!

26:42.518 --> 26:44.520
Peter, I'm the Doctor.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.028
Go into the past.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.609
One year ago.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.694
Let your mind go back.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.744
Back to when everything
was fine and shiny.

26:58.158 --> 27:02.629
Everything that happened in this year
since happened to somebody else.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.502
It's just a story.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.172
A winter's tale.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.217
Let go.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.431
That's it. That's it.

27:13.382 --> 27:14.975
Just let go.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.683
Tell me the story, Peter.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.814
Tell me about the witches.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.943
Who is this Doctor? Why does he come now
at our time of glory?

27:30.190 --> 27:32.613
Doomfinger, transport yourself.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.154
Doom the Doctor.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.202
Doom his hide.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.332
Witches spoke to Peter.

27:44.955 --> 27:48.255
In the night,
they whispered, they whispered...

27:53.130 --> 27:57.055
Got Peter to build the Globe
to their design, their design!

27:58.177 --> 27:59.770
The 14 walls.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.181
Always 14.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.025
When the work was done...

28:08.270 --> 28:11.865
They snapped poor Peter's wits.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.740
Well, where did Peter see the witches?
Where in the city?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.155
Peter, tell me!

28:18.238 --> 28:21.082
You've got to tell me. Where were they?

28:23.410 --> 28:24.957
All Hallows Street.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.705
Too many words!

28:26.788 --> 28:29.883
- What the hell?
- Just one touch

28:29.958 --> 28:31.801
of the heart.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.545
No!

28:38.050 --> 28:40.178
A witch! I'm seeing a witch!

28:40.260 --> 28:42.683
Now, who would be next, hmm?

28:42.763 --> 28:45.642
Just one touch.

28:48.644 --> 28:52.569
Oh, I'll stop your frantic hearts.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.071
Poor, fragile mortals.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.993
Let us out! Let us out!

28:57.110 --> 28:59.283
That's not going to work.
The whole building's shouting that.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.333
And who would die first, hmm?

29:02.407 --> 29:04.626
Well, if you're looking
for volunteers...

29:04.701 --> 29:06.874
- No, don't!
- Doctor, can you stop her?

29:06.995 --> 29:09.123
No mortal has power over me!

29:09.206 --> 29:11.550
No, but there's a power in words.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.920
If I can find the right one,
if I can just know you...

29:14.002 --> 29:16.255
None on Earth has knowledge of us.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.682
Well, it's a good thing I'm here.
Now, think, think, think.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.348
Humanoid, female, who uses
shapes and words to channel energy...

29:21.468 --> 29:23.266
Ah, 14!

29:23.387 --> 29:25.105
That's it, 14!

29:25.180 --> 29:28.605
The 14 stars of
the Rexel planetary configuration!

29:28.684 --> 29:30.903
Creature, I name you

29:30.978 --> 29:32.321
Carrionite!

29:39.194 --> 29:41.288
- What did you do?
- I named her.

29:41.363 --> 29:44.788
The power of a name. That's old magic.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.459
But there's no such thing as magic.

29:46.535 --> 29:49.254
Well, it's just a different sort of
science. You lot, you chose mathematics.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.295
Given the right string of numbers, the
right equation, you can split the atom.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.376
The Carrionites use words instead.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.302
Use them for what?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.052
The end of the world.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.307
He knows us!

30:08.390 --> 30:10.267
He spoke our name!

30:11.727 --> 30:15.072
Then he will know death.
He will perish at my hand.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.068
My mothers, the time approaches.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.617
You must away to the Globe.
Go, I will join you.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.787
As soon as this Doctor screams his last.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.204
The Carrionites disappeared
way back at the dawn of the universe.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.164
Nobody was sure
if they were real or legend.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.670
- Well, I'm going for real.
- But what do they want?

30:34.750 --> 30:37.048
A new empire on Earth.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.557
A world of bones and blood
and witchcraft.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.349
But how?

30:43.425 --> 30:46.520
I'm looking at the man with the words.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.018
Me? But I've done nothing.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.020
Hold on, though.
What were you doing last night

30:51.099 --> 30:52.601
when that Carrionite was in the room?

30:52.726 --> 30:55.104
Finishing the play.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.565
What happens on the last page?

30:57.647 --> 31:00.116
The boys get the girls,
they have a bit of a dance.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.321
It's all as funny and
thought-provoking as usual.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.289
Except those last few lines.

31:06.406 --> 31:10.206
Funny thing is,
I don't actually remember writing them.

31:10.285 --> 31:11.753
That's it!

31:12.579 --> 31:16.254
They used you.
They gave you the final words.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.382
Like a spell, like a code.
Love's Labour's Won, it's a weapon!

31:19.461 --> 31:21.384
The right combination of words
spoken in the right place

31:21.505 --> 31:23.883
with the shape of the Globe
as an energy converter!

31:23.965 --> 31:25.808
The play is the thing!

31:25.884 --> 31:28.137
And yes, you can have that.

31:36.812 --> 31:40.908
We left the lovers of Navarre,
by cruel chance separated,

31:41.024 --> 31:44.028
none to claim his heart,
their labours lost.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.281
Now will they find love's labour's won?

31:55.163 --> 31:57.837
All Hallows Street, there it is.
Martha, we'll track them down.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.760
Will, you get to the Globe.
Whatever you do, stop that play!

32:00.836 --> 32:03.589
I'll do it. All these years,
I've been the cleverest man around.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.174
Next to you, I know nothing.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.181
- Well, don't complain.
- I'm not! It's marvellous.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.061
- Good luck, Doctor.
- Good luck, Shakespeare.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.102
- Once more unto the breach!
- I like that!

32:13.181 --> 32:15.104
Wait a minute, that's one of mine.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.193
Oh, just shift!

32:17.853 --> 32:21.198
The eye should have contentment
where it rests...

32:23.650 --> 32:27.154
Patience, my sisters. Patience.

32:27.237 --> 32:30.832
- ...mewling poor, drooped men...
- Stop the play!

32:30.907 --> 32:34.127
I'm sorry,
ladies and gentlemen, but stop.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.705
This performance must end immediately.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.207
Oh, everyone's a critic.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.384
- The wordsmith!
- Fear not.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.587
I have the doll.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.884
I'm sorry. You'll get a refund.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.849
But this play must not be performed.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.731
- Is he drunk, or what?
- Get him out of the way!

32:59.060 --> 33:02.109
You must forgive our irksome Will.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.857
He's been on the beer,

33:03.940 --> 33:06.284
and feeling ill.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.875
There is naught can stop us now.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.546
All Hallows Street.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.003
Which house?

33:21.082 --> 33:23.426
Thing is, though,
am I missing something here?

33:23.502 --> 33:27.632
The world didn't end in 1599, it just
didn't. Look at me, I'm living proof.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.680
Oh, how to explain the mechanics
of the infinite temporal ﬂux?

33:30.759 --> 33:34.309
I know, Back to the Future!
It's like Back to the Future.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.561
- The film?
- No, the novelisation. Yes, the film!

33:37.641 --> 33:39.643
Marty McFly goes back
and changes history.

33:39.768 --> 33:43.363
And he starts fading away...
Oh, my God, am I going to fade?

33:43.438 --> 33:46.032
You and the entire future
of the human race.

33:46.107 --> 33:49.407
It ends right now, in 1599,
if we don't stop it.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.951
But which house?

33:58.787 --> 34:01.040
Make that witch house.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.643
I take it we're expected?

34:14.719 --> 34:18.599
Oh, I think death has been
waiting for you a very long time.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.980
Right then, it's my turn.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.187
I know how to do this.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.112
I name thee

34:25.188 --> 34:26.405
Carrionite!

34:28.440 --> 34:30.239
What did I do wrong? Was it the finger?

34:30.318 --> 34:33.822
Power of a name
works only once. Observe.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.998
I gaze upon this bag of bones,

34:36.074 --> 34:38.668
and now I name thee, Martha Jones.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.713
What have you done?

34:41.830 --> 34:43.753
Only sleeping, alas.

34:43.831 --> 34:47.005
It's curious, her name has less impact.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.838
She's somehow out of her time.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.344
And as for you, Sir Doctor.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.393
Fascinating.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.180
There is no name.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.517
Why would a man hide his title
in such despair?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.525
Oh, but look.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.903
There's still one word
with a power that aches.

35:08.982 --> 35:12.703
- The naming won't work on me.
- But your heart grows cold.

35:12.819 --> 35:16.699
The north wind blows
and carries down the distant...

35:17.532 --> 35:19.000
Rose.

35:19.743 --> 35:24.294
Oh, big mistake.
'Cause that name keeps me fighting.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.966
The Carrionites vanished.
Where did you go?

35:27.042 --> 35:30.763
The Eternals found the right word
to banish us into deep darkness.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.306
- Then how did you escape?
- New words.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.475
New and glittering.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.390
From a mind like no other.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.016
Shakespeare.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.732
His son perished.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.027
The grief of a genius.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.355
Grief without measure.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.861
Madness enough to allow us entrance.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.819
- How many of you?
- Just the three.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.246
But the play tonight
shall restore the rest.

35:56.321 --> 35:59.916
Then the human race
will be purged as pestilence.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.499
And from this world
we will lead the universe back

36:03.578 --> 36:06.252
into the old ways of blood and magic.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.713
Mmm, busy schedule.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.920
But first,

36:11.002 --> 36:13.255
you've got to get past me.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.133
Oh, that should be a pleasure.

36:16.257 --> 36:21.138
Considering my enemy
has such a handsome shape.

36:21.262 --> 36:25.358
Now, that's one form of magic
that's definitely not gonna work on me.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.559
Oh, we'll see.

36:28.353 --> 36:31.448
- What was that for? What did you do?
- Souvenir.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.362
Well, give it back!

36:37.153 --> 36:39.030
Well, that's just cheating.

36:39.155 --> 36:45.128
Behold, Doctor. Men to Carrionites
are nothing but puppets.

36:46.413 --> 36:51.135
Now, you might call that magic,
I'd call that a DNA replication module.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.758
What use is your science now?

36:59.801 --> 37:01.724
Oh, my God, Doctor!

37:01.803 --> 37:04.022
Don't worry, I've got you.

37:07.475 --> 37:10.820
Hold on, mister. Two hearts?

37:10.895 --> 37:13.239
I'm making a habit of it.

37:15.525 --> 37:18.404
I've only got one heart working!

37:18.695 --> 37:20.823
How do you people Cope?

37:20.905 --> 37:24.500
I've got to get the other one started.
Hit me! Hit me on the chest!

37:25.326 --> 37:26.828
Other side!

37:27.662 --> 37:29.835
Now, on the back, on the back!

37:29.914 --> 37:31.837
Left a bit!

37:33.460 --> 37:36.213
Lovely. There we go. By-da-boom-ba!

37:36.838 --> 37:40.684
Well, what are you standing there for?
Come on, the Globe!

37:43.052 --> 37:45.555
- The Doctor?
- Dead.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.432
The ladies have prepared a show.

37:47.557 --> 37:52.028
Maria means to present Isis
to send him from the dewy orb of heaven.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.147
Ah! Here comes Costard.

37:58.526 --> 37:59.903
Masters.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.834
- We're going the wrong way!
- No, we're not!

38:06.868 --> 38:09.371
We're going the wrong way!

38:11.664 --> 38:14.167
Behold the swinish sight
of woman's love.

38:14.250 --> 38:17.174
Pish! It's out of season
to be heavy disposed.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.005
It is now, my mothers.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.967
The final words
to activate the tetradecagon.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.269
Betwixt Dravidian shores

38:24.344 --> 38:29.316
and linear 5-9-3-0-1-6-7 point 0-2,

38:29.390 --> 38:32.644
and strikes the fulsome grove
of Rexel 4.

38:32.727 --> 38:35.230
Co-radiating crystal, activate!

38:35.730 --> 38:37.778
The portal opens!

38:37.899 --> 38:39.367
It begins!

38:44.072 --> 38:47.326
I told thee so! I told thee!

38:50.411 --> 38:51.833
Stage door!

39:11.516 --> 39:14.770
Stop the play! I think that was it.
Yeah, I said stop the play!

39:14.853 --> 39:17.857
- I hit my head.
- Yeah, don't rub it, you'll go bald.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.949
I think that's my cue.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.614
Now begins the millennium of blood!

39:30.368 --> 39:33.087
The Doctor! He lives.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.336
Then watch this world
become a blasted heath.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.585
They come, they come!

40:12.744 --> 40:15.623
- Come on, Will, history needs you.
- But what can I do?

40:15.705 --> 40:18.174
- Reverse it!
- How am I supposed to do that?

40:18.291 --> 40:21.170
The shape of the Globe gives
words power, but you're the wordsmith.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.721
The one true genius,
the only man clever enough to do it.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.761
But what words? I have none ready.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.513
You're William Shakespeare!

40:27.634 --> 40:31.229
But these Carrionite phrases,
they need such precision.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.940
Trust yourself.
When you're locked away in your room,

40:34.015 --> 40:35.608
the words just come, don't they?
Like magic.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.902
Words of the right sound,
the right shape, the right rhythm,

40:37.977 --> 40:39.695
words that last forever!

40:39.812 --> 40:42.861
That's what you do, Will.
You choose perfect words.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.030
Do it! Improvise!

40:51.991 --> 40:55.120
Close up this din
of hateful, dire decay,

40:55.203 --> 40:57.752
decomposition of your witches' plot!

40:57.872 --> 41:00.546
You thieve my brains,
consider me your toy,

41:00.625 --> 41:03.219
my doting Doctor tells me I am not!

41:03.336 --> 41:04.553
No!

41:04.629 --> 41:06.051
Words of power!

41:06.130 --> 41:08.804
Foul Carrionite spectres,

41:08.883 --> 41:11.807
cease your show, between the points...

41:13.221 --> 41:14.768
7-6-1-3-9-0!

41:15.056 --> 41:17.184
7-6-1-3-9-0!

41:17.600 --> 41:21.696
Banished like a tinker's cuss,
I say to thee...

41:24.273 --> 41:25.399
Uh...

41:25.984 --> 41:27.327
Expelliarmus!

41:27.402 --> 41:29.621
- Expelliarmus!
- Expelliarmus!

41:29.737 --> 41:31.330
Good old JK!

41:35.660 --> 41:37.333
The deep darkness!

41:37.412 --> 41:39.585
They are consumed!

41:56.055 --> 41:58.899
Love? Labour's Won, there it goes.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.686
They think it was all special effects?

42:34.802 --> 42:36.975
Your effect is special, indeed.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.183
It's not your best line.

43:11.172 --> 43:12.765
And I say,

43:12.840 --> 43:16.094
a heart for a hart, a dear for a deer.

43:16.177 --> 43:19.807
- I don't get it.
- Then give me a joke from Freedonia.

43:19.931 --> 43:24.107
Okay, Shakespeare walks into a pub,
and the landlord says,

43:24.185 --> 43:26.153
"Oi, mate, you're Bard."

43:26.229 --> 43:28.778
That's brilliant!

43:28.898 --> 43:31.651
Doesn't make sense, mind you,
but never mind that. Come here.

43:31.734 --> 43:33.156
I've only just met you.

43:33.236 --> 43:37.366
The Doctor may never kiss you.
Why not entertain a man who will?

43:39.158 --> 43:41.957
I don't know how to tell you this,
0 Great Genius,

43:42.036 --> 43:44.380
but your breath doesn't half stink.

43:44.455 --> 43:47.174
Good prop store back there!

43:47.250 --> 43:49.673
I'm not sure about this, though.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.345
Reminds me of a Sycorax.

43:51.420 --> 43:55.141
Sycorax. Nice word.
I'll have that off you as well.

43:55.216 --> 43:58.095
- I should be on 10%. How's your head?
- Still aching.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.221
Here, I got you this.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.732
Neck brace.

44:03.391 --> 44:05.814
Wear that for a few days
until it's better.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.066
Although you might want to keep it,
it suits you.

44:08.146 --> 44:11.400
- What about the play?
- Gone. I looked all over.

44:11.524 --> 44:14.198
Every single copy of Love's Labour's Won
went up in the sky.

44:14.277 --> 44:17.622
- My lost masterpiece.
- You could write it up again.

44:17.697 --> 44:19.699
Yeah, better not, Will.

44:19.782 --> 44:23.002
There's still power in those words.
Maybe it should best stay forgotten.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.954
Oh, but I've got new ideas.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.665
Perhaps it's time
I wrote about fathers and sons,

44:27.748 --> 44:30.092
in memory of my boy, my precious Hamnet.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.920
- Hamnet?
- That's him.

44:32.044 --> 44:33.796
- Ham-net?
- What's wrong with that?

44:33.921 --> 44:35.923
Anyway, time we were off.

44:36.048 --> 44:38.050
I've got a nice attic in the Tardis

44:38.176 --> 44:40.599
where this lot
can scream for all eternity.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.101
And I've got to take
Martha back to Freedonia.

44:43.181 --> 44:46.025
You mean travel on
through time and space?

44:46.100 --> 44:47.192
You what?

44:47.268 --> 44:48.861
You're from another world,
like the Carrionites.

44:48.936 --> 44:51.780
And Martha here's from the future.
It's not hard to work out.

44:51.856 --> 44:55.030
That's incredible. You are incredible.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.908
We're alike in many ways, Doctor.

44:57.987 --> 45:01.617
Martha, let me say goodbye to you
with a new verse.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.872
A sonnet for my dark lady.

45:06.871 --> 45:09.215
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

45:09.290 --> 45:11.713
Thou art more lovely, more temperate...

45:11.792 --> 45:13.294
- Will!
- Will!

45:13.377 --> 45:15.471
Will, you'll never believe it.
She's here!

45:15.546 --> 45:19.050
- She's turned up!
- We're the talk of the town.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.727
She heard about last night.
She wants us to perform it again.

45:21.802 --> 45:25.022
- Who?
- Her Majesty. She's here!

45:28.184 --> 45:30.186
Queen Elizabeth I!

45:30.311 --> 45:32.063
- Doctor!
- What?

45:32.146 --> 45:34.865
- My sworn enemy.
- What?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.734
Off with his head!

45:36.817 --> 45:39.320
- What?
- Well, never mind what, just run!

45:39.403 --> 45:41.076
- See you, Will. And thanks!
- Stop him!

45:41.155 --> 45:43.453
Stop that pernicious Doctor!

45:47.995 --> 45:50.748
Stop! In the name of the Queen!

45:50.831 --> 45:52.708
What have you done to upset her?

45:52.833 --> 45:55.554
How should I know? I haven't met
her yet! That's time travel for you.

45:55.628 --> 45:57.630
Still, I can't wait to find out.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.841
That's something to look forward to.

45:59.966 --> 46:01.343
Ooh!

46:06.847 --> 46:08.815
And we're slap-bang in the middle
of New New York.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.564
I am the last of my kind.

46:10.685 --> 46:11.982
Help us!

46:14.897 --> 46:16.865
You've got to let her go!

46:16.983 --> 46:18.656
Martha!

46:19.151 --> 46:21.028
I need to talk to the police.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.078
- Do you want some happy?
- Buy some anger!

46:25.199 --> 46:26.701
How much do you want forgetting?

46:26.826 --> 46:28.306
Pretty well dressed for a hitchhiker.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.955
They say people go missing
on the motorway.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.791
Some cars just vanish,
never to be seen again.

46:33.874 --> 46:36.297
Is there something living down there?

46:36.377 --> 46:38.129
What the hell are they?
