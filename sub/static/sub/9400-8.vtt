WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:02.130
previously on "one tree hill".

00:02.150 --> 00:03.020
it's over.

00:03.030 --> 00:04.440
Because of one bad signing?

00:04.450 --> 00:06.290
Go home,write another book.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.480
I promise I'll read the next one.

00:08.490 --> 00:11.070
Listen,I heard you were looking 
for the opportunity to play ball again.

00:11.090 --> 00:14.660
- Yes,sir. 
- Well,I have one for you.

00:14.670 --> 00:15.340
So,what do you think,man?

00:15.350 --> 00:17.240
You gonna come play for us?

00:17.250 --> 00:18.710
You have to do this,daddy.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.220
I'm just worried my back can't take something like this right now.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.500
Ohh.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.330
I'm surprising myself by saying it,

00:24.340 --> 00:27.070
but.I have an extra room,

00:27.080 --> 00:28.940
and it's yours if you want it.

00:28.950 --> 00:30.640
We're prepared to offer you a bigger salary

00:30.650 --> 00:32.500
and the on-air position you should have had.

00:32.509 --> 00:35.370
You get a better position and a hot intern.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.400
Hot intern?

00:37.500 --> 00:39.810
- Gigi? 
- Mouth!

00:40.130 --> 00:41.670
What?You guys know each other?

00:41.680 --> 00:43.750
We were high-school lovers.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.200
You'll be careful,right?

00:46.220 --> 00:47.930
I won't go trying to be a hero or anything.

00:47.940 --> 00:50.130
Come here.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.620
I'll be back,peyton.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.450
I believe you.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.110
I told you I wanted to be a mom,

00:55.120 --> 00:57.390
and you ran away so fast,

00:57.410 --> 00:59.900
you left an owen-shaped hole in my front door.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.990
You're right.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.770
I'm sorry.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.930
You're still a jerk.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.390
All right,nice work,guys.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.930
Go home,get some rest.

01:36.940 --> 01:39.240
Game time's 8:00.

01:39.450 --> 01:41.110
Not bad for a rookie.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.200
You ready for tonight?

01:42.210 --> 01:44.140
Bring it on.I got this.

01:44.150 --> 01:45.170
We'll see,man.

01:45.180 --> 01:46.920
It's kind of different in the game.

01:46.930 --> 01:48.830
How different?

01:54.050 --> 01:55.660
that different.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.510
Did he get up,mama?

01:58.520 --> 02:01.070
Yeah,baby,he got up.this time.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.770
Hey.How's he doing?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.040
Well,he's in one piece for now,

02:04.050 --> 02:06.760
but I thought owen was gonna protect him.

02:07.180 --> 02:10.810
Hey,99,thought you were gonna protect 23!

02:11.240 --> 02:15.450
And why don't you get over your whole fear of 
having children while you're at it?

02:16.580 --> 02:18.540
Hey,you're short.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.930
I'm 5.What's your excuse?

02:20.940 --> 02:23.910
Nice.So,what's your name?

02:23.920 --> 02:25.730
James lucas scott.

02:25.740 --> 02:26.930
Scott,huh?

02:26.940 --> 02:28.280
Yeah,he's teacher's pet.

02:28.290 --> 02:29.340
Hi,sam.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.590
How uncool are you,hanging out with your teacher?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.030
It's borderline creepy.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.490
Totally.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.030
So,what's going on here?

02:43.050 --> 02:44.540
It's called slamball.

02:44.550 --> 02:48.090
Dunks are worth three points,
and jump shots are worth two points.

02:48.110 --> 02:50.120
My daddy plays on the slashers with owen.

02:50.130 --> 02:51.850
You hear me,owen?

02:51.860 --> 02:54.180
You better watch nathan's back!

02:54.200 --> 02:55.400
Literally!

02:57.970 --> 02:59.570
They used to kiss.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.360
Hey,sam,I'm peyton.

03:02.370 --> 03:04.510
I really like your outfit,man.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.560
Thank you.It's a lot like yours,actually.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.880
Geez,millie,who knew you were such a sports fan?

03:24.890 --> 03:26.550
I'm not.I'm looking for mouth.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.740
Mouth and gigi?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.090
Gigi the ex?

03:30.100 --> 03:32.560
Gigi the college junior/the new intern/

03:32.570 --> 03:35.380
the ex with her college-girl body and her college-girl face!

03:35.390 --> 03:37.110
Okay.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.710
They used to kiss -- mouth and gigi.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.130
He kisses millicent now.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.730
- I'm liking you. 
- Thanks.

03:44.740 --> 03:48.720
Mama says I'm not allowed to date yet,but daddy says it's fine.

03:50.100 --> 03:50.970
- What? 
- Hey,P.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.210
Sawyer- soon-to-be-scott,

03:52.220 --> 03:54.150
where's your fancy fianc?

03:54.160 --> 03:56.570
I have no idea.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.990
Could you say that again?

04:03.220 --> 04:04.920
No,I-I guess I just don't understand.

04:04.930 --> 04:07.290
I thought the book wasn't doing well.

04:09.060 --> 04:10.970
Oh.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.800
Wow.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.860
Man,this is some great stuff.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.150
Yes.It is.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.260
Um,marvin?

04:26.880 --> 04:28.170
Millicent,hi.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.300
What are you doing down here?

04:29.310 --> 04:31.530
Just wanted to say hi.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.290
Okay.Hi.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.290
Oh,uh,millie,this is gigi,my intern.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.430
Gigi,this is millicent.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.680
Hi.Millicent.

04:38.690 --> 04:40.550
Marvin's girlfriend.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.560
Millicent -- marvin's hot girlfriend.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.120
Nice work,mouth.

04:46.130 --> 04:48.920
- Hi.Gigi. 
- Hi.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.570
So,should I wait for you after the game or.

04:51.590 --> 04:55.470
um,well,we have to go back to the studio 
and digitize some of this footage.

04:55.490 --> 04:58.010
We're doing a piece on nathan's journey to slamball.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.600
It was mouth's idea.

04:59.610 --> 05:02.030
He's kind of a genius like that.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.500
You have awesome legs,by the way.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.900
Yeah.Okay.

05:07.910 --> 05:09.260
I'll see you at home,then?

05:09.270 --> 05:10.550
Not too late?

05:10.570 --> 05:12.710
Not too late.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.500
Well,we better get back to the game.

05:27.510 --> 05:29.060
Watch your step,mouth.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.380
Why?

05:30.390 --> 05:33.130
You don't want to trip on that short leash.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.660
Time-out.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.020
Nathan,you made three jump shots in a row.

05:52.030 --> 05:53.180
What the hell is that?

05:53.190 --> 05:54.290
It's called scoring.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.870
It's called slamball!

05:55.880 --> 05:57.470
What are you -- hurt?You need a seat?

05:57.480 --> 05:58.650
No,I'm good.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.040
Then get in there and take over this game.

06:00.050 --> 06:01.990
Now,I need you.Let's go.

06:05.180 --> 06:06.970
- Hey. 
- Hey,there he is.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.210
I thought you might have ditched me.

06:08.230 --> 06:09.160
What's up?

06:09.170 --> 06:11.530
I just got a call from my agent.

06:11.540 --> 06:13.810
Someone made an offer for the movie rights to my book.

06:13.820 --> 06:17.110
Luke!For "the comet"?That's great!

06:17.130 --> 06:22.140
No,actually,not for "the comet," but,um,"ravens.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.140
1,2,3.

06:25.150 --> 06:26.300
Slashers!

06:26.310 --> 06:27.680
What you think,man?You up for this?

06:27.690 --> 06:29.500
Not if it's gonna put me back in a wheelchair.

06:29.510 --> 06:31.230
It won'T.That's easy for you to say.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.480
You're not the one with the ball.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.350
Exactly.

06:33.380 --> 06:34.110
Stay behind me.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.500
All right.

06:39.570 --> 06:40.480
Hot ball,hot ball!

06:40.490 --> 06:42.650
Knock his ass out!

06:48.780 --> 06:50.940
- Nice! 
- Thanks.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.870
Let's go,all-american.

07:15.670 --> 07:18.690
wasn't he,like,just in a wheelchair or something?

07:28.700 --> 07:30.570
morning,daddy.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.060
You're alive,right?

07:33.070 --> 07:34.450
I think so.

07:34.460 --> 07:35.900
Can you walk?

07:35.910 --> 07:36.860
Yeah,I'm good.

07:36.870 --> 07:38.350
Prove it.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.120
I will if you get off me,you dork.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.940
Should I get mama?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.690
Jamie,I'm fine.Look.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.450
You happy?

07:56.190 --> 07:58.000
No?

08:01.920 --> 08:04.770
Well,the dancing's not so good,but okay.

08:04.790 --> 08:07.010
Good game,daddy.

08:14.070 --> 08:15.260
Haley james?

08:15.270 --> 08:16.710
In here!

08:16.720 --> 08:18.710
There's coffee.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.950
We pretty much share this house 50/50,don't you think?

08:22.950 --> 08:25.560
- Yeah.Why? 
- I don't know.

08:25.570 --> 08:27.620
This stupid article.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.320
Do I even want to ask?

08:33.789 --> 08:36.000
I'm fine.

08:37.179 --> 08:39.620
Really,I'm fine.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.010
What?

08:57.460 --> 09:00.620
So,you've had a night to sleep on it.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.690
Where's your head at with this whole movie thing?

09:03.700 --> 09:04.850
I don't know.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.730
You know,on one hand,it could be really cool.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.740
But you know how personal that book is.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.660
You know,the stuff with us and keith.

09:12.670 --> 09:15.560
Yeah,but it's already in the book,right?

09:15.570 --> 09:16.620
Yeah,I know.

09:16.630 --> 09:21.450
I guess I just feel like I can control the book more.

09:22.580 --> 09:26.950
Well,whatever you decide to do is 
the right thing as far as I'm concerned.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.460
Thanks,babe.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.100
I got to get going.

09:32.660 --> 09:35.060
All right,well,call me when you get there,
and be careful,all right?

09:35.070 --> 09:36.840
I will.

09:36.850 --> 09:39.030
Hey.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.910
I sort of like you,you know that?

09:40.920 --> 09:41.690
Well,thank you.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.020
I'm kind of warming up to you,too.

09:44.340 --> 09:47.400
It's a good thing,since we're getting married.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.910
Bye.

09:54.950 --> 09:56.920
It's really good,brooke.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.730
Peyton's gonna love it when it's done.

09:58.740 --> 10:02.540
Yeah,well,I hope so,considering we have nothing else to sell.

10:02.550 --> 10:05.510
How could I have signed my company over to that.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.150
- slut? 
- Too nice.

10:08.170 --> 10:11.390
How about.slunt?

10:12.200 --> 10:15.410
Millie,what are we gonna do with this place?

10:15.430 --> 10:17.060
You know what?I like it like this.

10:17.070 --> 10:18.920
Oh,do you?

10:20.550 --> 10:22.530
Aunt brooke!

10:22.880 --> 10:25.320
It's my favorite man.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.130
Who's your favorite girl?

10:27.150 --> 10:28.720
Sam!

10:29.230 --> 10:30.060
Excuse me?

10:30.070 --> 10:31.990
Who is yr favorite girl?

10:32.010 --> 10:33.730
You are?

10:33.990 --> 10:36.740
All right,that'll do.Get out of here.

10:37.610 --> 10:39.530
I have been replaced.

10:40.510 --> 10:43.080
I will take one unfinished wedding dress.

10:43.090 --> 10:45.440
That's all I want,and I'll pay top dollar for it.

10:45.450 --> 10:50.070
Well,I'll pay top dollar for one song off of an unfinished album.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
I don't like this game anymore.

10:52.090 --> 10:53.540
Mm,I feel you.

10:53.550 --> 10:56.040
So,what's going on with baby brooke?

10:56.050 --> 10:57.890
Victoria's lawyers say she owns it.

10:57.900 --> 11:01.970
Brooke's lawyers say victoria's lawyers 
can baby brooke themselves.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.700
Have you thought about starting a new line,brooke?

11:06.710 --> 11:08.890
You've done it before.You can do it again.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.770
I appreciate the vote of confidence,haley,

11:11.780 --> 11:15.030
but I'm just not feeling inspired lately.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.270
Well,speaking of,owen looked pretty hot last night.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.330
Didn't you think so,millie?

11:19.340 --> 11:22.100
Totally.What did you think,brooke?

11:22.460 --> 11:25.080
I think sam is driving me crazy,

11:25.090 --> 11:28.680
wilding about like a feral cat!

11:28.900 --> 11:32.600
Sam,this is a boutique.

11:32.610 --> 11:34.160
It is not a skate park.

11:34.170 --> 11:36.020
Well,you could have fooled me.

11:36.030 --> 11:39.740
If you have a plan to fill this place up,have at it.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.540
Otherwise,go skate in traffic.

11:42.550 --> 11:44.920
Clearly,I've upgraded sam's foster-living environment.

11:44.930 --> 11:46.730
Clearly.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.840
Mama,can I sleep over at aunt brooke's tonight?

11:50.860 --> 11:52.240
Oh,sweetie,I don't know if aunt brooke

11:52.250 --> 11:53.570
I would love that.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.050
It would be nice to have a man in the house.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.960
Awesome.Thank you.

11:57.970 --> 12:01.730
And speaking of,I thought owen looked pretty hot last night.

12:01.740 --> 12:02.900
Didn't you think so,millie?

12:02.910 --> 12:05.600
Totally.What did you think,brooke?

12:06.380 --> 12:09.400
I think I don't like either of you.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.410
Lucas scott.

12:18.090 --> 12:19.950
- Maybe. 
- Julian baker.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.820
I think your agent called you about me.

12:21.830 --> 12:23.690
I'm interested in optioning your book.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.960
Yeah,they called me last night.

12:26.090 --> 12:28.290
Uh,they didn't say anything about you coming to town,though.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.690
No,no.Actually,they don't know.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.040
I'm just passing through on my way to new york.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.220
Right.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.590
You're just passing through tree hill,huh?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.290
Absolutely.Yeah,I want to get a feel

12:37.300 --> 12:40.920
for the people and places that inspired your book.

12:40.930 --> 12:44.030
It is really great work,lucas.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.710
- Yeah,well,thanks,but 
- yeah,you probably feel a little ambushed.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.060
- Yeah,a little bit. 
- Yeah,right.

12:49.070 --> 12:50.270
I'm sorry.I understand.

12:50.290 --> 12:54.410
When I get ,when I get inspired by something,
I get a little obsessed.

12:54.420 --> 12:59.170
Not in a peyton-stalker sort of way,just -- just driven.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.720
What did you say your name was again?

13:05.740 --> 13:07.920
- Julian baker. 
- Julian.

13:07.930 --> 13:09.900
I tell you what.I'm gonna be in town for the night.

13:09.910 --> 13:11.160
Check out my credits online.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.670
If you're feeling it,give me a call.We'll grab a drink.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.930
You got plans?

13:15.940 --> 13:17.290
Maybe.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.780
That's exactly what I would have said.

13:19.790 --> 13:20.770
Fair enough.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.050
But if you don't,at least hear me out.

13:22.060 --> 13:26.080
If you don't like what I have to say,
I'm gone,okay?I promise.

13:26.090 --> 13:29.840
At the very least,you get a couple of 
free drinks from a guy who loves your work.

13:30.450 --> 13:33.180
All right,your agent has my number,okay?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.700
- Okay. 
- Good.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.790
Well,it's great to finally meet you,lucas scott.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.190
Your reputation precedes you.

13:44.110 --> 13:48.440
Oh,by the way,the house is exactly like I pictured it.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.660
It's perfect.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.330
So,congratulations.

14:35.340 --> 14:37.540
Congratulations,marine.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.710
What did you do?Save another life?

14:40.730 --> 14:44.100
No.They just thought it would look good with the uniform.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.020
- Hi,peyton. 
- Hi,big brother.

14:48.260 --> 14:49.620
Hey,I missed you.

14:49.630 --> 14:51.340
I missed you,too.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.270
Come on.

14:56.110 --> 14:58.670
- Hey,gigi. 
- Hey,sexy.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.570
And you wonder why millicent has me on such a short leash.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.490
Look,I know we're friends,but since you're my intern,

15:04.500 --> 15:07.730
maybe you should call me something other than sexy,all right?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.300
Okay,hot piece of ass.

15:10.980 --> 15:12.170
Sorry.

15:12.180 --> 15:13.740
How are you doing with the nathan footage?

15:13.750 --> 15:15.020
Uh,it's all in the system.

15:15.030 --> 15:16.760
I've got video from nathan in high school,

15:16.770 --> 15:19.030
video from gilmore,video from maryland.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.180
I think I've even got that video of him 
and brooke in there somewhere.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.680
All right.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.310
How about we start with something from his accident?

15:25.330 --> 15:27.090
You know,we set the stakes.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.640
Then we can flash back and work our way up to slamball.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.000
Talented and sexy.

15:32.010 --> 15:34.050
- Gigi. 
- Oh,come on,mouth.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.780
If I can't joke around with you,who can I joke around with?

15:36.790 --> 15:38.620
Besides,you know you love it.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.160
That is not the point.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.300
Oh,so you do love it.

15:42.310 --> 15:45.220
Just start with the accident,and I'll be back.

15:48.110 --> 15:50.100
Gigi,uh.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.000
it is nice working with you again.

15:53.010 --> 15:54.270
You're doing great.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.350
Thanks.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.640
I know I give you a lot of grief,

15:56.650 --> 16:00.030
but I think it's amazing watching you work.

16:00.110 --> 16:02.030
I missed you.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.330
Sexy.

16:11.530 --> 16:13.430
- Hey,man. 
- Hey.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.480
- What you doing? 
- Making pancakes.

16:15.490 --> 16:18.280
Really?Why?

16:18.290 --> 16:20.110
'Cause I want pancakes.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.400
There's a list over there on the table.

16:22.460 --> 16:24.090
What's the list for?

16:24.100 --> 16:26.220
Guys to play me in the movie.

16:26.230 --> 16:27.730
God,you've got to be kidding me.

16:27.740 --> 16:29.820
What?I don't want some tool playing me.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.190
So,I guess you've heard,huh?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.970
Yeah.Haley told me.

16:33.980 --> 16:35.330
It's pretty cool,man.

16:35.340 --> 16:36.920
Yeah,I guess.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.520
The producer actually stopped by my door today.

16:40.530 --> 16:41.300
Good guy?

16:41.310 --> 16:42.380
You know,it's hard to say.

16:42.390 --> 16:45.100
You know,I mean,he's got some cool credits,but.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.920
I don't know.I don't want them to screw this up,you know?

16:46.930 --> 16:49.160
I mean,who's gonna be directing it?

16:49.170 --> 16:51.030
Who's gonna write the script?

16:51.200 --> 16:53.670
Maybe that's a question you should ask him.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.850
Yeah.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.080
You want some pancakes now,don't you?

16:58.090 --> 16:59.950
Yes,I do.

17:01.370 --> 17:04.800
Hey,and,uh,hate to break it to you,
but shia labeouf?

17:04.810 --> 17:07.210
I think he's a little too old to play you for high school.

17:07.220 --> 17:08.020
Oh,come on,man.

17:08.030 --> 17:10.619
You've seen how old these actors are playing high school.

17:12.569 --> 17:14.780
- Yes. - Thank you.

17:15.970 --> 17:18.280
So,did you see me get my clocked cleaned in the game last night?

17:18.290 --> 17:19.540
No,actually,I missed it.

17:19.550 --> 17:20.599
How are you feeling?

17:20.609 --> 17:22.300
I'm a little sore.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.069
Haley was kind of freaked out,but I'm fine.

17:25.990 --> 17:29.220
You know,luke,I never saw this slamball thing coming,

17:29.230 --> 17:32.010
but I guess that's part of the journey.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.950
And this movie thing -- I mean,

17:33.960 --> 17:37.490
it could be good for you,could really open some other doors.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.210
Yeah,maybe.

17:40.270 --> 17:41.900
Hey,nate.

17:42.390 --> 17:46.130
Haley's holding her breath over slamball 
so you can chase your dream.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.400
Just,uh.

17:48.410 --> 17:51.110
let her know it's gonna be okay,all right?

17:51.120 --> 17:52.740
Yeah.

17:53.370 --> 17:56.160
What's peyton think of the movie?

17:56.170 --> 17:58.010
Uh,what do you mean?

17:58.020 --> 18:00.410
Well,I mean,she's basically half the book.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.800
How does she feel about it?

18:01.820 --> 18:04.230
She said she's good with it either way.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.440
What about brooke?

18:07.600 --> 18:10.290
Dude,brooke's the other half.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.720
I was happy to get your letter and the invitation.

18:16.730 --> 18:18.000
A little surprised,though.

18:18.020 --> 18:19.970
I just figured you'd be out by now.

18:19.980 --> 18:21.630
You make it sound like prison.

18:21.640 --> 18:25.120
No,no,I mean,you've been in a while.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.410
The marines have been good for me,all right?

18:27.420 --> 18:29.050
It's what I know.

18:32.050 --> 18:35.480
So,how was he?Our dad,mick?

18:35.490 --> 18:39.430
Mm,I mean,pretty much the way you said he'd be  kind of lost.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.230
I think underneath everything,he is a good guy,

18:42.240 --> 18:44.800
but he's just not much of a father.

18:45.360 --> 18:49.990
You know,I asked mick to play a U.S.O.Show for us once.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.630
Entertain the base.I figured,it's what he does,you know?

18:52.640 --> 18:54.050
Yeah.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.950
He said he'd get back to me.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.780
I'm still waiting.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.860
I miss quentin a lot,mama.

19:06.350 --> 19:08.260
I miss him,too,buddy.

19:08.270 --> 19:10.870
I think he's playing basketball,like daddy.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.040
Only instead of a trampoline,he can bounce on the clouds.

19:14.050 --> 19:16.570
Yeah?I like that.

19:16.970 --> 19:20.040
Did you always like quentin,mama?

19:20.050 --> 19:25.110
You know,the first time I met quentin,
I thought he was a bad kid.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.310
But I was wrong.

19:27.370 --> 19:28.480
He had such a good heart.

19:28.490 --> 19:31.860
He was just.afraid to show it at first.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.090
You excited about your sleepover with aunt brooke?

19:38.100 --> 19:40.810
- Oh,yeah. 
- Oh,good.

19:41.210 --> 19:42.800
We should get going,buddy.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.690
Okay.Bye,"Q.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.000
" Chester says bye,too.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.350
He misses you like we do.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.810
Bye,quentin.

19:54.670 --> 19:57.260
Do you think he's lonely in heaven?

19:57.270 --> 20:00.050
No.I think he's happy.

20:00.060 --> 20:03.310
I think he is,too.

20:10.890 --> 20:11.830
Hey.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.040
So, where's the little orphan girl?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.380
What's her name?Annie?

20:15.490 --> 20:17.990
Sam. And you so cannot be in here right now!

20:19.170 --> 20:20.440
Why not?

20:20.550 --> 20:22.230
Because I am working on peyton's wedding dress, 

20:22.340 --> 20:24.110
and it is bad luck to see it before the wedding.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.320
And considering your luck with weddings, my friend, 

20:26.440 --> 20:28.520
would you really like to chance this?

20:28.640 --> 20:29.700
Very funny.

20:30.170 --> 20:35.270
But I thought that,the dress **lied 
only when the bride was wearing it.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.860
You might have a point there.

20:38.700 --> 20:39.970
Fine.

20:40.090 --> 20:41.990
It's your wedding to ruin anyway.

20:42.150 --> 20:45.300
Tell me that you're here because you want me 
to make your tux and double my business.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.460
Actually, I'm meeting with this movie producer about "ravens," 

20:48.570 --> 20:50.910
and I wanted to talk to you about it first.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.830
I'm thinking natalie portman should play me.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.240
I can call her if you want.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.590
It's set in high school.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.390
Does anybody get that?I mean.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.260
great.

20:58.370 --> 21:02.020
So, I suppose you'll be getting some snot from the cw?

21:04.010 --> 21:05.670
At least they're hot.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.470
Okay, so, does that mean it's okay with you, I mean,

21:09.600 --> 21:11.420
if the book becomes a movie?

21:11.910 --> 21:13.930
Sure. Why not?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.900
Well, I don't know.Sometimes things 
get lost in translation, you know?

21:17.020 --> 21:20.380
Okay.I think you're jumping to conclusions here, writer boy.

21:20.490 --> 21:22.370
Because first of all, it's got to get made.

21:22.530 --> 21:27.960
And if it does, who's to say 
it's not gonna be this epic, kick-ass love story?

21:28.080 --> 21:31.620
I mean, I am making peyton's wedding dress.

21:31.780 --> 21:34.180
That actually might be a great way to end it, you know?

21:34.310 --> 21:35.750
And I could always play me.

21:35.830 --> 21:37.200
All right.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.600
Yeah, here we go.

21:38.710 --> 21:40.920
I guess I can consider you on board, then, huh?

21:41.040 --> 21:41.990
Yeah.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.940
For the record, that dress is unbelievable.

21:46.170 --> 21:47.160
Well.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.070
you're kind of talented, brooke davis.

21:49.180 --> 21:52.080
Well, you are not so bad yourself, lucas scott.

21:52.750 --> 21:53.780
Hey.

21:54.770 --> 21:56.870
Could you really call natalie?

21:56.980 --> 21:59.230
Close friend. So much fun.

21:59.340 --> 22:00.870
Good to know.

22:03.730 --> 22:06.840
Are there things that you've learned through 
all of this adversity, nathan?

22:06.960 --> 22:08.970
I mean, do you ever think that maybe the struggle 

22:09.080 --> 22:11.100
and the setbacks have made you a better person?

22:11.220 --> 22:13.100
I guess so.

22:13.210 --> 22:16.110
I mean, I like to think that 
if I would have made it to the nba out of maryland, 

22:16.220 --> 22:18.390
I'd still be a good guy.I hope so.

22:18.550 --> 22:19.440
Mouth?

22:19.560 --> 22:21.120
We're about to roll out any second.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.300
Okay.let's cut and grab another tape.

22:23.370 --> 22:25.320
Sure thing, sexy.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.940
Sorry. I was talking to nathan.

22:32.730 --> 22:34.980
You know, one of the biggest lessons I ever learned is 

22:35.060 --> 22:38.220
never to flirt with cute girls 
that aren't your wife or your girlfriend.

22:38.370 --> 22:40.120
What? You don't mean gigi?

22:40.240 --> 22:43.100
No, I'm not talking about the hot college girl you used to date.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.060
Why would I be talking about her?

22:45.750 --> 22:49.350
Look, millie's a rock star. Don't screw that up.

22:50.130 --> 22:51.690
- Be right back, okay? 
- Okay.

22:54.180 --> 22:56.750
Man, what the hell?

22:56.860 --> 23:00.060
Without me, you'd be sitting on the bench shooting jump shots.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.430
And you get the interview?

23:01.550 --> 23:03.340
I'm telling you -- I get no love.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.720
You want me to hook you up?

23:04.840 --> 23:06.740
Tell you what -- you keep the interview.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.730
Why don't you hook me up with brooke instead?

23:08.850 --> 23:10.100
That girl's so over me.

23:10.210 --> 23:11.940
Well, she's had a tough run lately.

23:12.060 --> 23:14.800
But on the list of 100 things you screwed up in your life, 

23:14.960 --> 23:17.820
I'd say losing brooke davis is number 1 through 99.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.810
What's the other one?

23:20.310 --> 23:21.770
That haircut.

23:22.530 --> 23:25.160
Or the drug addiction. One of the two.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.220
Excuse me.

23:36.340 --> 23:39.420
Does your mother let you skateboard on her hardwood floors?

23:41.310 --> 23:43.570
Oh, you've been saved by the bell, my friend.

23:43.670 --> 23:45.530
You should go play in sam's room.And by "play,"

23:45.610 --> 23:49.050
I do not mean smoke anything, 
drink anything, or burn the house down, okay?

23:54.820 --> 23:56.010
Hey, brooke.

23:56.170 --> 23:59.530
No way.You cannot have him back already.He just got here.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.750
Who? Jamie?

24:00.910 --> 24:02.970
You can totally keep him.The kid's a menace.

24:03.090 --> 24:04.760
I'm here to talk to you about owen.

24:04.870 --> 24:07.530
And since when do you have owen's back?

24:07.760 --> 24:09.960
Since he's standing right next to me.

24:10.530 --> 24:11.850
Hey.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.470
You should tell your little friend owen that 

24:15.590 --> 24:17.080
if he has something to say to me, 

24:17.190 --> 24:20.720
he can talk to me himself and 
stop being so 7th grade about it.

24:20.870 --> 24:22.770
Dude, if you have something to say to her, 

24:22.880 --> 24:25.940
you should say it yourself and 
stop being so 7th grade about it.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.120
Hi.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.450
Hello.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.260
What you doing?

24:38.340 --> 24:39.370
Texting.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.300
About what?

24:40.460 --> 24:41.670
Party.

24:42.050 --> 24:43.320
Want to go?

24:50.720 --> 24:52.810
why don't you just use the door?

24:52.970 --> 24:54.870
Because it's more like an adventure.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.540
Like "goonies.

24:56.650 --> 24:58.070
" What's "goonies"?

24:58.180 --> 25:00.750
Dude, you totally did not just ask me that.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.200
You ever done anything wild?

25:03.390 --> 25:06.680
I got kidnapped by my nanny once,

25:06.940 --> 25:09.430
chased through a cornfield,

25:09.870 --> 25:12.120
and fell in a swimming pool...

25:12.990 --> 25:14.820
And anything on purpose?

25:15.470 --> 25:18.500
All right, well, it's a lot more fun 
when it's on purpose.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.590
So you want to go to the party or what?

25:20.780 --> 25:22.530
Is there a moonbounce?

25:22.610 --> 25:24.320
There's moonshine.

25:24.620 --> 25:25.760
Okay.

25:46.890 --> 25:50.220
Well, well, the site of our historic throwdown.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.530
You want a rematch?

25:51.650 --> 25:52.560
Careful now.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.890
Besides, that's how I met lucas.

25:56.050 --> 25:59.470
The night we had to deal with the crazy white fake me, 

25:59.580 --> 26:04.510
- and now you can laugh - it's funny.

26:05.380 --> 26:07.790
And you and lucas are getting married?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.970
Doing pretty good, peyton.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.630
You're doing good.

26:11.900 --> 26:14.830
I didn't mean anything about you still being a marine.

26:14.980 --> 26:19.360
I think we're all looking for a life 
that makes sense somehow, 

26:19.480 --> 26:22.190
and I am very, very happy for you that you found that.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.760
And have you found it?

26:25.330 --> 26:28.280
Yes. I have.

26:28.430 --> 26:30.530
I mean, it sneaks up on you, right?

26:30.640 --> 26:32.780
But one day, you look at your life, and 

26:32.860 --> 26:37.860
it has purpose and someone that 
makes you feel very special and friends.

26:38.060 --> 26:41.580
And it's like, all of a sudden, 
all the time and pain that

26:41.700 --> 26:44.790
 it took to get there, 
it just doesn't matter anymore.

26:46.070 --> 26:47.410
Yeah, I've been waiting to hear you say that 

26:47.530 --> 26:50.180
since you stood in this ring and started fighting back.

26:53.230 --> 26:57.370
Look, I know that mick hurt you by 
not being the kind of father you needed him to be, 

26:57.490 --> 27:00.100
but you made it anyway, you know?

27:00.220 --> 27:02.710
You've got people pinning medals on you.

27:03.130 --> 27:07.590
And so, maybe all the pain it took for you to get here 

27:07.970 --> 27:10.810
doesn't matter anymore for you, too, big brother.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.490
Maybe.

27:14.090 --> 27:18.110
Well, I have to get going, but I had an idea.

27:18.300 --> 27:23.920
I own a small record label, 
and I have some connections back from my years in L.A.

27:25.130 --> 27:27.880
How about we do that U.S.O.Show?

27:29.240 --> 27:30.410
You'd do that?

27:30.680 --> 27:31.920
Sure.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.750
That's what family does, right?

27:34.740 --> 27:36.570
Sounds perfect.

27:36.730 --> 27:37.880
Okay.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.470
Come on, I'll walk you out.

27:45.910 --> 27:49.430
Great.All these years, 
and you'll get me busted down to private.

27:55.890 --> 27:56.920
Hey.

27:57.030 --> 27:58.150
Hey. What's up?

27:58.310 --> 28:02.220
Oh, I just dropped off the little monster 
at brooke's for the sleepover, 

28:02.340 --> 28:05.520
and, it's just nathan and I tonight.

28:06.430 --> 28:08.410
Bow chicka bow bow 

28:08.530 --> 28:13.560
very funny.Actually, I was thinking about 
playing a little piano, taking a nice long bath.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.530
And then.bow chicka bow.

28:17.920 --> 28:18.870
sorry.

28:20.190 --> 28:24.120
Speaking of bad pornos, how was your movie offer?

28:24.290 --> 28:25.460
Nice.

28:25.570 --> 28:28.440
No, I don't know.I'm actually about to
 go meet the producer to talk about it.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.090
So, you think you're gonna do it?

28:30.200 --> 28:32.300
My agent thinks I'd be crazy not to.

28:32.380 --> 28:33.520
Cool.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.750
'Cause I was thinking of ellen page for me.

28:35.890 --> 28:37.930
And I was thinking ellen page for mia.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.250
Mia? She's not even in your book.

28:40.370 --> 28:43.080
Right. I just thought I'd write her in.

28:43.210 --> 28:47.170
Great. That little brat steals my life, 
and now she steals my wish-list actor.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.720
And not to mention I'm totally screwing with you.

28:53.990 --> 28:56.720
So, how you doing with slamball?

28:56.880 --> 28:59.350
You know, I've got a husband with a bad back, 

28:59.470 --> 29:01.070
and he's playing a game called slamball, 

29:01.180 --> 29:04.100
so you just let me know when I can breathe again.

29:04.260 --> 29:06.130
Haley, he's gonna be okay.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.940
Look, nathan wants what he wants, 

29:10.400 --> 29:12.460
but he's gonna do it smarter this time.

29:12.570 --> 29:15.680
I mean, he knows that he has the best wife 

29:15.840 --> 29:18.650
and son ever to consider in all this.

29:18.770 --> 29:22.050
Yeah.He has been really sweet through all of it.

29:24.330 --> 29:29.120
In fact, I think I'm gonna go home and 
visit with my sweet husband.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.080
Bow chicka bow wow 

29:40.140 --> 29:41.390
Julian.

29:41.510 --> 29:42.690
Hey. Glad you made it.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.390
I hope you don't mind.
I got a -- I got a thing for dive bars.

29:45.510 --> 29:46.890
You ever been here before?

29:47.720 --> 29:49.390
It's a joke.

29:50.450 --> 29:51.850
Not a good one, but.

29:52.310 --> 29:56.880
no, I-I know this is your spot.
I always wanted to see the infamous tric.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.750
It sounds like you've done your research.

29:58.870 --> 30:02.330
Luke, I'm so inside this story.
I can't get it out of my head.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.130
Look, I, uh -- I checked out your credits, 
and you're for real.

30:06.270 --> 30:10.610
But,  this story's really personal, you know?

30:10.680 --> 30:13.740
That's why I want you to write the screenplay.

30:13.920 --> 30:14.850
What?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.930
There's no one else that can tell this story.

30:17.050 --> 30:18.310
It's your voice, luke.

30:18.420 --> 30:22.220
On top of that, you'll find that the screen trade 
pays a hell of a lot more than your book deal.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.150
It's not about the money.

30:27.350 --> 30:28.520
Okay, okay.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.240
With you, I may actually believe that.
Nevertheless, six figures.

30:32.350 --> 30:33.340
Really?

30:33.480 --> 30:34.540
100 grand?

30:34.620 --> 30:36.310
More like 300 grand, 

30:36.460 --> 30:40.030
and another three if we get the movie made, 
and I'll get the movie made.

30:42.880 --> 30:46.360
So, in the book, it says peyton moved to L.A.
Did she like it there?

30:46.520 --> 30:47.960
Yeah, she loved it there.

30:48.060 --> 30:50.190
Well, if this works out -- and it will -- 

30:50.310 --> 30:52.790
you're gonna be a successful screenwriter.
You could visit her.

30:52.910 --> 30:56.990
Well, actually, she lives here now. We're engaged.

30:58.740 --> 31:01.720
Well, the world loves a happy ending.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.980
Listen, you don't know me, 
but I honestly feel as though I know you.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.090
If you option this book to me, 
I'll give you complete control of the script.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.710
We'll do this thing together.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.690
Come on, what do you say?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.440
Trying something new?

31:27.560 --> 31:28.810
Yeah.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.080
Let me hear.

31:30.230 --> 31:31.550
Okay.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.000
Well, what?

31:37.720 --> 31:39.440
Sorry. Nothing.

31:39.550 --> 31:41.020
Oh. Okay.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.150
What -- what is wrong with you?

31:51.260 --> 31:53.310
I can't play with you making faces like that.

31:53.430 --> 31:55.890
I know. Neither can I.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.790
You're so funny.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.940
We were worried about you.

32:04.100 --> 32:07.350
My back is fine. I promise.

32:07.990 --> 32:09.120
Okay.

32:09.610 --> 32:11.620
Well, it's too bad, 'cause, you know, 

32:11.740 --> 32:14.340
jamie's sleeping over at brooke's, and,

32:14.670 --> 32:18.360
I thought maybe you'd want a little massage.
But, you know, it's fine.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.770
Well, it's not perfect.As a matter of fact, I was thinking.

32:21.850 --> 32:25.110
maybe you could just carry me upstairs tonight?

32:25.220 --> 32:27.470
- Carry? 
- Is that okay?

32:38.130 --> 32:39.770
I made a mistake.

32:43.130 --> 32:44.790
I was into you.

32:45.170 --> 32:48.530
I am into you. I just -- 

32:51.200 --> 32:52.270
Look.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.950
I'm an idiot.

32:55.290 --> 32:57.350
Just hold that thought.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.030
Brooke, there's a problem at the -- oh.

33:02.910 --> 33:04.790
Owen.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.220
Imagine that.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.360
Sorry. There's a problem at the store.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.950
The nosy guy across the street called 
and said he saw someone breaking in.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.510
- Call the police. 
- No.

33:14.630 --> 33:16.070
- Brooke. 
- No!

33:16.150 --> 33:17.870
Fine. I'll go.

33:17.980 --> 33:19.230
No. I will go.

33:19.350 --> 33:21.760
I just need to tell sam to watch jamie.
And I need to get my gun.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.170
Wait. What?

33:24.840 --> 33:26.050
Hey, sam.

33:47.890 --> 33:49.600
I should have brought the gun.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.610
Brooke.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.740
Oh, my god.

33:52.820 --> 33:53.790
Brooke.

33:56.220 --> 33:57.380
I'm gonna kill her.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.280
Come here.

33:59.590 --> 34:01.050
- Will you take him? 
- Yeah, I got him.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.300
Sam!

34:03.480 --> 34:05.720
What the hell are you doing?

34:05.840 --> 34:08.080
I told you I could fill this place up.

34:08.199 --> 34:11.630
First of all, you are 15 years old.

34:11.699 --> 34:15.719
Second, you kidnapped a 5-year-old child, 
you adolescent nanny carrie!

34:15.830 --> 34:19.400
And third, you are breaking and 
entering in the place where I work!

34:19.520 --> 34:20.830
This is the place.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.460
that is peyton's wedding dress.

34:28.739 --> 34:31.400
Oh, dude, chill out. It's fine. It's right.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.370
oh, no. 

34:35.489 --> 34:36.739
Where is it?

34:46.219 --> 34:47.860
Everybody out!

34:55.929 --> 34:57.680
Let's go! Now!

34:58.760 --> 35:00.370
Everybody head out!

35:02.660 --> 35:04.350
I'm sorry.

35:09.010 --> 35:10.450
Get out!

35:11.670 --> 35:13.150
Not you.

35:21.370 --> 35:24.890
I make this shot, it's an equal producer credit, huh?

35:25.610 --> 35:27.470
Co-producer.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.220
Producer.

35:29.490 --> 35:31.340
Just shoot.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.570
I can't believe I just gave you a producer credit.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.890
Here, hurry up and sign this before I change my mind.

35:42.170 --> 35:44.750
you know, talk to peyton first.

35:44.870 --> 35:48.030
You know what, my friend?That's exactly 
why this movie should be made.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.600
Lucas scott and peyton sawyer made it.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.850
They're together. It's inspiring.

35:55.550 --> 35:58.140
This contract is simply an option.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.210
It gives me exclusive rights to the book for six months  

36:00.320 --> 36:02.110
to do everything I say I'm gonna do.

36:02.230 --> 36:05.070
If not, all the rights revert back to you.

36:05.220 --> 36:06.700
Yeah, I know.

36:06.890 --> 36:09.990
I called my agent, and he thinks I should sign it, too, but.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.550
he's a smart guy.

36:13.580 --> 36:14.840
Okay.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.780
Six months.

36:23.030 --> 36:25.650
We are about to get so drunk.

36:26.440 --> 36:30.280
I promise you this will go down in history as 
an epic day in your life, lucas.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.460
I hope so.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.210
I got to go call peyton.

36:34.350 --> 36:35.960
Have her come meet us to celebrate.

36:36.080 --> 36:36.900
All right

36:42.700 --> 36:43.960
Thanks, buddy.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.010
I'm really sorry, aunt brooke.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.690
It's okay, jamie. It's not you I'm mad at.

36:55.850 --> 36:57.210
It's sam, huh?

36:57.330 --> 36:58.490
Yeah.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.450
But I am a little bit mad at you.

37:02.680 --> 37:06.750
You should have told me that you were leaving the house tonight.

37:06.870 --> 37:09.770
You can't trust people when they're bad.

37:09.890 --> 37:12.830
I know. But sam's not bad.

37:15.460 --> 37:17.480
I don't know about that, buddy.

37:17.590 --> 37:21.390
She's not. I think she's like quentin was 
when mama met him.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.730
She's nice. She's just afraid to show it.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.230
hey. You need any help?

37:39.350 --> 37:41.020
No, I'm good. You should take off.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.800
Okay.Uh, see you tomorrow?

37:42.920 --> 37:44.320
Sure. Drive safe.

37:44.550 --> 37:49.460
Hey, a bunch of my friends are gonna meet up 
for drinks later if you want to go.

37:49.570 --> 37:51.900
Thanks. I should get home.

37:52.010 --> 37:55.800
Okay. I had a great day with you, mouth.

37:55.930 --> 37:57.930
It felt like old times.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.180
Yeah, I had a great day, too.

38:00.300 --> 38:03.830
Well, you better get back to the old ball and chain.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.410
See you tomorrow.

38:22.430 --> 38:25.070
I'm getting worried about slamball.

38:25.410 --> 38:27.080
It's my fault.

38:27.230 --> 38:30.770
I underestimated the speed of this game.

38:30.920 --> 38:34.040
Some of these guys are great athletes.They're fast.

38:34.690 --> 38:37.770
Well, you're gonna have to be faster, because

38:37.890 --> 38:41.030
I don't know if I can handle another game like the last one.

38:41.150 --> 38:42.520
I will be.

38:42.710 --> 38:44.670
'Cause I know you're trusting me.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.080
I love you for that.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.560
she's on her way.She's just running a little late.

39:01.830 --> 39:03.680
Maybe there's another guy.

39:04.690 --> 39:07.130
Why did I sign that option again?

39:07.290 --> 39:08.910
That reminds me -- I got to make a quick call.

39:09.010 --> 39:10.450
I'll be right back, okay?

39:17.030 --> 39:18.830
Hey, nice shot.

39:19.740 --> 39:22.590
Nice everything. Wow, you look hot.

39:22.710 --> 39:24.650
No, I don'T. I was like a tornado at home.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.920
Um, where's this producer?
I need to ply him with many questions.

39:28.070 --> 39:29.490
He had to make a call on his cell.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.850
Okay.Well, in that case, I'm gonna go check my handiwork.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.770
Oh. You look so hot.

39:34.880 --> 39:35.680
Bye.

39:48.510 --> 39:51.200
I don't think detergent removes spray paint.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.940
I know there's nothing I can say other than "I'm sorry.

39:56.130 --> 39:59.020
I do these stupid things sometimes.

39:59.550 --> 40:01.790
I really am sorry, though.

40:02.940 --> 40:05.600
You were nice to me, but I'm just not worth it.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.420
And where do you think you're going?

40:07.530 --> 40:08.320
I don't know.

40:08.510 --> 40:10.640
You're grounded.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.700
You're not kicking me out?

40:12.810 --> 40:15.970
No.And I hope that someday, 

40:16.130 --> 40:18.980
you stop acting surprised when you hear that.

40:19.150 --> 40:22.500
Now go to your room.Actually, go to my room,

40:22.610 --> 40:24.440
 because the windows don't open.

40:24.510 --> 40:29.640
- Can I just say about the party --  
- sam, I am so pissed off right now.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.750
Go.

40:32.020 --> 40:34.480
I'm sorry, jamie.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.800
I think it's kind of cool.

40:52.130 --> 40:54.340
You've gotten even more beautiful.

40:54.450 --> 40:56.380
What are you doing here,julian?

40:56.500 --> 40:59.490
Haven't you heard? I'm optioning your fiance's book.

40:59.610 --> 41:01.510
Like hell you are. 

41:01.630 --> 41:03.950
Actually, it's already done.

41:04.220 --> 41:05.930
I'm quite charming.

41:06.770 --> 41:08.780
But you know that, baby.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.590
Hey. There you are.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.650
Well, I see you two have already met, huh?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.870
Yes, we have.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.280
And you know what, lucas?

41:21.360 --> 41:23.530
It feels like I've known her for years.
