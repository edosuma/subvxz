I DONATED MONEY

I MADE YOU BUTTER COOKIES

04:28.351 --> 04:31.105

BUT LEFT-FOOTED.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.480
IT'S BETTER

04:31.146 --> 04:32.480
THAT YOU'RE NOT SEXY.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.325
VOLCANIC VACATION'S

04:44.367 --> 04:46.620
ABOUT TO TAKE

04:44.367 --> 04:46.620
A VERY TRAGIC TURN.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.329
"SOME MAGAZINE"?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.832
"PEOPLE" IS ON

04:48.371 --> 04:50.832
THE CUTTING EDGE OF EVERYTHING.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.375
YOU ONLY THINK

04:50.874 --> 04:52.375
THOSE GUYS ARE SEXY

04:52.417 --> 04:54.419
BECAUSE "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE

04:52.417 --> 04:54.419
TOLD YOU TO THINK THAT.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.337
THEY COULD PUT

04:54.461 --> 04:56.337
FOZZIE BEAR ON THE COVER,

04:56.379 --> 04:57.338
AND YOU WOULD THINK

04:56.379 --> 04:57.338
HE WAS SEXY.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.340
OH, DO NOT BE RIDICULOUS,

04:57.380 --> 04:59.340
OKAY?

04:59.382 --> 05:01.593
I WOULD WANNA HUG HIM

04:59.382 --> 05:01.593
BECAUSE HE TRIES SO HARD,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.344
BUT I DO NOT THINK

05:01.635 --> 05:03.344
THAT HE IS SEXY.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.347
JUNE, YOU ARE A SHEEP

05:03.386 --> 05:06.347
JUST FOLLOWING THE HERD.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.724

05:06.389 --> 05:07.724

IT'S "BAAA."

05:09.434 --> 05:12.187
SEE? YOU'RE A SHEEP.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.187
THAT WAS A TRAP.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.396
YOU'RE WRONG.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.439
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.984
I'LL PROVE TO YOU

05:14.481 --> 05:16.984
ONCE AGAIN THAT I AM RIGHT.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.820
RIGHT AFTER I BURY

05:17.025 --> 05:19.820
THESE TINY ITALIANS IN LAVA.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.989
IT WAS THEIR FIRST

05:19.861 --> 05:21.989
FAMILY VACATION, TOO.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.323
SO SAD.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.537

05:29.579 --> 05:31.873
OOH. I KNOW I SAID THIS

05:29.579 --> 05:31.873
LAST YEAR,

05:31.915 --> 05:34.542
BUT, OOH-LA-LA,

05:42.425 --> 05:45.386
IT IS SO GOOD

05:42.425 --> 05:45.386
TO BE BACK STATESIDE.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.555
LONDON IS FILTHY,

05:45.428 --> 05:47.555
AND NOT IN THE WAY YOU LIKE IT.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.892
WHERE ARE WE ON "SEXIEST"?

05:47.597 --> 05:50.892
CATCH ME UP.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.062

05:57.232 --> 05:58.399
HELLO, LIZ. YOU'RE FIRED.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.652

05:58.441 --> 06:00.652
HAVE A QUESTION?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.903
WHAT HAPPENED TO LARRY?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.446
GOOD QUESTION. YOU'RE FIRED.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.740
WHO WANTS TO MAKE IT A TRIFECTA?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.412
HELLO? HAVE I BEEN TOO SUBTLE?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.581
YOU'RE FIRED. THANK YOU

06:11.454 --> 06:13.581
FOR YOUR YEARS OF DEDICATION.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.833

06:14.875 --> 06:16.417
UH...

06:16.459 --> 06:18.128

06:16.459 --> 06:18.128
(pounds table)

06:22.465 --> 06:24.425
UM...

06:24.467 --> 06:25.384
MM.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.395
(Chloe sighs)

06:37.522 --> 06:40.441
UM--

06:37.522 --> 06:40.441
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.152
A FRESH START.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.445
LET'S THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.490
LET'S THROW THE EXPECTED

06:44.487 --> 06:47.490
OUT THE WINDOW.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.450
(thud, slap)

06:49.492 --> 06:52.411
THAT'S A VERY CLEAN WINDOW.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.084
(pen cap clicks)

06:57.125 --> 07:00.337
(squeaking)

07:00.379 --> 07:02.421
(pen scribbling)

07:08.345 --> 07:09.554
(tapping)

07:09.596 --> 07:11.472
WHY DID I DRAW MALE GENITALIA

07:09.596 --> 07:11.472
ON THE BOARD?

07:11.514 --> 07:12.766
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.518
BECAUSE IT'S OUTSIDE

07:12.807 --> 07:15.518
OF THE BOX?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.561
NO.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.561
(pen cap clicks)

07:16.603 --> 07:18.146
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.481
(clatters)

07:18.188 --> 07:20.481
NOW LET'S GET TO WORK.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.734

07:22.776 --> 07:25.528
SOMEBODY HANG UP MY COAT!

07:22.776 --> 07:25.528

07:25.570 --> 07:27.488
AAH!

07:27.530 --> 07:28.489
(Chloe) BAM.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.490
WHAT IS THAT?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.492
OKAY, THIS IS NOT REAL.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.661
I HAD THEM MOCK THIS UP

07:31.534 --> 07:33.661
DOWN AT THE OFFICE.

07:33.703 --> 07:37.332
I BECAME THE MANAGING EDITOR

07:33.703 --> 07:37.332

07:41.378 --> 07:43.713

07:50.553 --> 07:53.014

08:23.295 --> 08:25.922
WELL, WHY DID YOU STOP

08:23.295 --> 08:25.922

08:25.964 --> 08:27.966
THIS IS JUST THE COVER.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.634

08:28.008 --> 08:29.634

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
OH, NO! THERE ARE NO

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
DIRTY DISHES.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.268
I KNEW YOU WOULD TRY

08:36.599 --> 08:38.268
TO DISTRACT YOURSELF

08:38.310 --> 08:39.727
SO I THREW THEM ALL

08:38.310 --> 08:39.727

08:39.769 --> 08:41.396
NOW LOOK AT JAMES, JUNE.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.778
EXCOMMUNICATED FROM DENMARK.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.990

09:43.166 --> 09:45.626
SHE THINKS YOU'RE SEXY,

09:43.166 --> 09:45.626
BUT SHE WON'T ADMIT IT.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.295
I WOULD LOVE TO TEASE HER

09:45.668 --> 09:47.295

10:21.204 --> 10:23.623

OVER THE YEARS

11:06.541 --> 11:08.960

13:01.489 --> 13:03.241
I CAN'T TELL US APART.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.826
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.826
HE IS MY SMOOTHIE BUDDY.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.246
LOOK, YOU NEED TO STOP THINKING

13:05.868 --> 13:08.246
OF HIM AS SEXIEST MAN ALIVE...

13:05.868 --> 13:08.246
(sighs)

13:08.288 --> 13:11.832
AND JUST START THINKING OF HIM

13:08.288 --> 13:11.832
AS YOUR FRIEND JAMES.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.543
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.044
(slaps sides)

13:13.585 --> 13:15.044
HE'S JUST JAMES.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.299
OKAY--NO.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.299
OH, OH, NO, NO, NO.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.299
NO, NO, NO.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.883
IT'S JUST JAMES.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.762
OH, NO. HE HAS GOT

13:20.925 --> 13:23.762
A QUIRKY, ADORABLE PET

13:23.802 --> 13:25.346
LIKE CLOONEY'S PIG.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.348
HE'S MORE THAN JUST A FACE!

13:25.388 --> 13:27.348
(gasps)

13:25.388 --> 13:27.348
STEADY.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.350
AH, HELLO, JUNE.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.060
HAVE YOU MET

13:29.392 --> 13:31.060
MY PET TURTLE STEPHANIE?

13:31.102 --> 13:34.731
SHE PREFERS BUTTER LETTUCE

13:31.102 --> 13:34.731
TO ALL OTHER LETTUCES.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.233
(gasps) HE'S EVEN GOT

13:34.773 --> 13:37.233
AN EARRING LIKE FORD.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.652
EASY.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.862
JUST, UH, PREPPING FOR

13:38.693 --> 13:41.862
MY S.M.A. Q & A.

13:41.904 --> 13:42.905
HIT ME, LUTHER.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.866
IF YOU WERE A BIRD,

13:42.947 --> 13:45.866
WHAT KIND WOULD YOU BE?

13:45.908 --> 13:48.161
HAWAIIAN NENE GOOSE,

13:48.202 --> 13:50.371
BECAUSE THEY MATE FOR LIFE

13:48.202 --> 13:50.371
AND LIVE IN HAWAII.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.914
OH...

13:50.413 --> 13:51.914
I CAN'T IMAGINE

13:50.413 --> 13:51.914
ANYTHING BETTER.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.292
NEITHER CAN I.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.292
OH! GOD...

13:54.334 --> 13:56.336
OH...

13:54.334 --> 13:56.336
AHH! MNH!

13:57.545 --> 13:59.088
COME ON, MAN.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.882
THE TURTLE, THE EARRING,

13:59.130 --> 14:01.882
THE ROMANTIC ANSWERS.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.301
ARE YOU DOING ALL THIS

14:01.924 --> 14:03.301
JUST TO MESS WITH JUNE?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.346
YEAH, AT FIRST I WAS,

14:03.343 --> 14:06.346
BUT THEN I REALIZED,

14:06.387 --> 14:08.348
I'M GONNA NEED TO BECOME

14:06.387 --> 14:08.348
MORE DIMENSIONAL

14:08.389 --> 14:10.183
IF I'M GONNA BE

14:08.389 --> 14:10.183
THE REIGNING S.M.A.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.602
AFTER THIS ISSUE COMES OUT,

14:10.224 --> 14:12.602
I WON'T BE ABLE TO COME IN HERE

14:12.644 --> 14:13.894
WITHOUT GETTING MOBBED.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.396
(dramatic orchestral score

14:13.936 --> 14:15.396
playing)

14:15.438 --> 14:18.483
(sighs) GOOD-BYE,

14:15.438 --> 14:18.483
IT'S JUST BEANS.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.360
I'VE ENJOYED OUR TIME

14:18.525 --> 14:20.360
TOGETHER.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.778
(inhales) BUT NOW I'M LIKE...

14:21.820 --> 14:25.323
(exhales) NEW ORLEANS

14:21.820 --> 14:25.323
BEFORE THE LEVEES BURST.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.866
MY FAME LEVEE'S ABOUT TO BLOW.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.411
GRAB YOUR PONCHOS, PEOPLE.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.330
(door bells jingle)

14:30.453 --> 14:32.330
BYE!

14:35.333 --> 14:36.751
(sighs)

14:36.793 --> 14:39.128
PANTLESS HANDSTAND ON A HORSE--

14:36.793 --> 14:39.128
NOT SEXY. NOW WE KNOW.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.341
YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.341
(gasps)

14:43.383 --> 14:45.760
YOU PUT JAMES ON THE COVER,

14:43.383 --> 14:45.760
AND NOW I THINK HE'S SEXY.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.596
I AM A SHEEP. YOU WIN. OKAY?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.596
NOW TAKE IT OFF,

14:48.638 --> 14:50.390
BECAUSE IT'S RUINING

14:48.638 --> 14:50.390
MY FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.933
FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU

14:50.431 --> 14:52.933
FOR ADMITTING I WAS RIGHT.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.312
SECOND, I CAN'T TAKE HIM OFF.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.312
IT'S MY JOB TO SELL MAGAZINES.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.439
YOUR JOB? YOU'VE BEEN

14:56.354 --> 14:58.439
WORKING HERE FOR THREE DAYS.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.859
AND I'VE COME IN

14:58.481 --> 15:00.859
FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.737
LOOK, THIS IS ABOUT MORE

15:00.900 --> 15:03.737
THAN JUST YOU NOW, JUNE.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.780
THIS IS ABOUT

15:03.778 --> 15:05.780
MILLIONS OF WOMEN

15:05.822 --> 15:10.243
LOOKING TO ME FOR GUIDANCE

15:05.822 --> 15:10.243
ON WHAT TO WEAR, HOW TO COOK,

15:10.284 --> 15:12.829
AND WHO TO FANTASIZE ABOUT

15:10.284 --> 15:12.829
WHEN THEY FLUFF THE DUFF.

15:12.871 --> 15:16.207
(laughing)

15:12.871 --> 15:16.207
SHUT UP, JONAH!

15:12.871 --> 15:16.207
UGH. IGNORE HIM.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.959
(clenches teeth) HE'S MY COUSIN.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.959
MY MOTHER MADE ME HIRE HIM.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.212
THIS IS INSANE.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.212
YOU DON'T WORK HERE.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.964
NO ONE IS LOOKING TO YOU

15:21.254 --> 15:23.964
FOR GUIDANCE ON ANYTHING!

15:24.006 --> 15:25.842
IS THAT SO?

15:25.884 --> 15:28.261
STRAWBERRY LIP BALM,

15:25.884 --> 15:28.261
A BERET, AND SMINTS--

15:28.302 --> 15:29.929
THAT'S WHAT'S IN YOUR PURSE.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.976
HOW DID YOU--

15:36.018 --> 15:37.771
I KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR PURSE

15:36.018 --> 15:37.771
BECAUSE WE--

15:37.812 --> 15:40.022
ME AND MY MAGAZINE--

15:37.812 --> 15:40.022
PUT THEM THERE.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.482
WE TOLD YOU THOSE ITEMS

15:40.064 --> 15:41.482
WERE HOT,

15:41.524 --> 15:42.983
AND YOU WENT OUT

15:41.524 --> 15:42.983
AND BOUGHT THEM.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.903
THAT'S THE KIND OF POWER

15:43.025 --> 15:44.903
WE HAVE.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.030
WELL, YOU ALSO HAVE THE POWER

15:44.944 --> 15:48.030
TO HELP OUT YOUR ROOMMATE.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.408
IT'S TRUE, I DO, BUT I ALSO

15:48.072 --> 15:50.408
HAVE A MAGAZINE TO RUN.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.995
WHY ARE YOU HANDING ME

15:52.326 --> 15:54.995
TWO OF THE EXACT SAME PICTURE?

15:55.037 --> 15:56.997
UH, IT'S FOR "SECOND LOOK."

15:55.037 --> 15:56.997
IT NEEDS YOUR APPROVAL.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
(voice quavers) THERE ARE

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
15 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM.

15:59.041 --> 15:59.918
NO, THERE AREN'T.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.002
OKAY, ONE.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.255
THREE. NINE.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.882
15.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.882
THERE ARE 15 DIFFERENCES.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.634
OKAY, GOOD WORK.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.634
THIS CAN RUN.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.428
(whispers)

16:07.675 --> 16:10.428
OH, THANK YOU. BYE.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.012
JAMES WILL BE ON THE COVER.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.641
I'M SORRY IF THAT MEANS YOUR

16:12.054 --> 16:14.641
FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM IS OVER.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.604
(presses buttons)

16:19.646 --> 16:20.647
WHO IS THIS?!

16:19.646 --> 16:20.647
(door slams)

16:25.318 --> 16:26.486
SHE'S IN MY HEAD.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.028
SHE'S IN MY PURSE.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.197
YOU EVEN TOLD YOU

16:28.070 --> 16:30.197
TO WEAR THOSE BRACELETS.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.534
What?! No, I got these

16:30.239 --> 16:33.534
from a cart at the mall.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.536
BECAUSE THEY WERE FEATURED

16:33.576 --> 16:35.536
IN "STYLE WATCH"

16:35.578 --> 16:37.121
ON "PEOPLE'S" WEB SITE.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.249
CHLOE WAS RIGHT.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.249
(sighs) WE'RE JUST SHEEP.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.877
I-I think you're missing

16:40.291 --> 16:42.877
the bigger picture, honey.

16:42.919 --> 16:46.339
You have a chance

16:42.919 --> 16:46.339
no Colburn woman has ever had--

16:46.380 --> 16:49.509
a chance to bed

16:46.380 --> 16:49.509
a Sexiest Man Alive!

16:49.550 --> 16:52.052
JAMES IS MY FRIEND.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.052
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN THAT.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.888
Oh, this is something

16:52.094 --> 16:53.888
you can't just walk away from.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.139
The closest I ever got

16:55.181 --> 16:57.350
was shoving the Nick Nolte

16:55.181 --> 16:57.350
issue down my girdle.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.893
I'M HANGING UP NOW.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.436
Stop avoiding James!

17:00.478 --> 17:03.105
Tell him how you feel

17:00.478 --> 17:03.105
before it's too late!

17:03.147 --> 17:04.732
Hi, honey.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.235
You know what's not sexy?

17:08.277 --> 17:09.362
Regret.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.077
DRINK IT ALL IN, STEPHANIE.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.289
IT'S ALL GONNA BE DIFFERENT

17:17.119 --> 17:20.289
AFTER TODAY.

17:20.331 --> 17:23.292
IN A WAY, THESE ARE OUR

17:20.331 --> 17:23.292
LAST FEW MOMENTS OF FREEDOM.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.544
THERE YOU ARE.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.670
D-D--WATCH OUT!

17:25.712 --> 17:28.088
D-DID YOU NOT SEE

17:25.712 --> 17:28.088
THE BALLOON?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.590
LUTHER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

17:28.130 --> 17:29.590
A GOOD WAY TO KEEP TABS ON HER

17:29.632 --> 17:31.091
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.594
(singsongy) "VARSITY BLUES"

17:31.133 --> 17:33.594
IS ON ABC FAMILY!

17:33.636 --> 17:35.304
I REPEAT--

17:33.636 --> 17:35.304
(crunch)

17:36.556 --> 17:40.142
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

17:36.556 --> 17:40.142
WHEN I LOVE SOMETHING!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.896
TURNS OUT HE JUST STEPPED

17:40.184 --> 17:42.896
ON SOME LETTUCE, THANK GOD.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.147
COULD HAVE BEEN STEPH.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.025
LISTEN. I NEED

17:45.189 --> 17:47.025
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.109
CAN IT WAIT?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.109
THE NEWSSTAND'S ABOUT TO OPEN.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.361
I WANT TO HAVE SEX

17:49.151 --> 17:50.361
WITH YOU.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.988
JUNE, STOP.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.406
I CAN'T!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.406
I CAN'T FIGHT IT ANYMORE!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.115
MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE

17:53.447 --> 17:55.115
YOU'RE ON THE COVER

17:55.157 --> 17:56.409
OF "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE,

17:55.157 --> 17:56.409
BUT I DON'T CARE!

17:56.450 --> 17:59.161
I CAN'T STOP THINKING

17:56.450 --> 17:59.161
ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH YOU.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.121
LET ME HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.121
I JUST WANT TO HAVE--

18:01.163 --> 18:02.456
(kisses)

18:06.961 --> 18:07.962
NOTHING, RIGHT?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.129
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.173
EXACTLY. IT'S BECAUSE

18:09.171 --> 18:11.173
WE'RE FRIENDS--

18:11.215 --> 18:13.843
FRIENDS WHO SHARE SMOOTHIES,

18:11.215 --> 18:13.843
NOT SMOOCHIES.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.929
LISTEN, I KNOW I'VE BEEN

18:13.885 --> 18:15.929
TEASING YOU THIS WEEK,

18:15.970 --> 18:17.638
BUT... IT'S ALL IN FUN.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.640
I DON'T NEED YOU

18:17.680 --> 18:19.640
TO THINK I'M SEXY.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.935
ABOUT 45 MILLION

18:19.682 --> 18:21.935
OTHER PEOPLE ARE ABOUT TO,

18:21.976 --> 18:23.227
AND I NEED YOU

18:21.976 --> 18:23.227
TO BE MY FRIEND.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.229
(rattling)

18:25.271 --> 18:27.189
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?!

18:27.231 --> 18:29.776
I'M NOT ON THE COVER?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.776
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.611
(gasps)

18:31.652 --> 18:33.863
HE'S ON ALL OF THEM!

18:33.905 --> 18:34.989
(panting)

18:35.031 --> 18:37.450
WHO DID THIS?

18:35.031 --> 18:37.450
(clatters)

18:39.285 --> 18:41.370
WHAT IS GOING ON?

18:41.412 --> 18:43.247
WHY IS JAMES

18:41.412 --> 18:43.247
NOT ON THE COVER?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.874
UH, MARJORIE MUST HAVE

18:43.289 --> 18:44.874
NIXED IT.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.793
MARJORIE HAS FINAL SAY.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.045
STOP SAYING "MARJORIE" LIKE I'M

18:46.834 --> 18:49.045
SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO THAT IS.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.089
YOU DON'T KNOW

18:49.087 --> 18:51.089
WHO MARJORIE IS?

18:49.087 --> 18:51.089
OH, MY GOD!

18:51.130 --> 18:53.591
ONE MORE WORD,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.591
AND BRENDA GETS A SMACKWICH.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.175
I DON'T UNDERSTAND--

18:55.217 --> 18:57.177
HER FACE IS THE LUNCH MEAT,

18:55.217 --> 18:57.177
MY HANDS ARE THE BREAD!

18:57.219 --> 18:59.179
HUH?! OHH...

18:57.219 --> 18:59.179
SMACKWICH!

18:59.221 --> 19:03.183
NOW, CAN ANYONE GIVE ME

18:59.221 --> 19:03.183
CLARITY ON THIS SITUATION?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.103
THEY'RE, UH, TALKING

19:03.225 --> 19:05.103
ABOUT MARJORIE MEYERS.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.855
SHE'S WORKED FOR THE MAGAZINE

19:05.144 --> 19:07.855
SINCE ITS INCEPTION.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.190
SHE PICKS THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE

19:07.897 --> 19:10.190
EVERY YEAR.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.234
I'M MARJORIE MEYERS,

19:12.276 --> 19:15.488
GENIUS BEHIND

19:12.276 --> 19:15.488
"SEXIEST MAN ALIVE."

19:15.529 --> 19:18.240
I'M OFTEN ASKED,

19:15.529 --> 19:18.240
"WHAT IS MY SECRET?"

19:18.282 --> 19:20.200
I MERELY GO WITH THE MAN

19:20.242 --> 19:23.203
THAT GETS THINGS KICKING

19:20.242 --> 19:23.203
IN MY PANTS. (chuckles)

19:23.245 --> 19:25.623
AND THE OLD GAL

19:23.245 --> 19:25.623
HASN'T BEEN WRONG YET.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.001
EVERY YEAR THE STAFF GIVES

19:25.665 --> 19:28.001
THEIR TOP TEN CANDIDATES,

19:28.042 --> 19:30.628
AND MARJORIE IGNORES THEM

19:28.042 --> 19:30.628
AND GOES WITH HER PANTS.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.673
I WAS BAREBACK ON A HORSE

19:30.670 --> 19:33.673
FOR SEVEN HOURS

19:33.714 --> 19:35.049
WEARING NOTHING

19:33.714 --> 19:35.049
BUT A SHIRT.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.217
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW

19:35.091 --> 19:37.217
WHY PANTS WERE INVENTED?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.845
TO PREVENT WHAT HAPPENED

19:37.259 --> 19:38.845
TO ME.

19:38.886 --> 19:39.929
AND YOU LOOKED GREAT.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.848
WHICH IS WHY

19:39.971 --> 19:41.848
WE GAVE YOU A SPREAD.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.476
DAMN  DAMN,  I LOOK GOOD!

19:47.103 --> 19:49.022
I'LL TAKE IT.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.523
HI. REMEMBER US?

19:50.564 --> 19:52.150
WE'RE LIZ AND PETER.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.234
YEAH, SO IT TURNS OUT

19:52.191 --> 19:54.234
THAT YOU CAN'T FIRE US,

19:54.276 --> 19:55.486
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WORK HERE.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.237
(sighs) FINALLY!

19:57.279 --> 19:59.490
HOW DID IT TAKE YOU FIVE DAYS

19:57.279 --> 19:59.490
TO PUT THAT TOGETHER?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.075
WELL, WE JUST HAD

19:59.532 --> 20:01.075
OUR EXIT INTERVIEW--

20:01.117 --> 20:03.161
I DON'T CARE. I'M EXHAUSTED.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.079
I, UH, JUST WANT TO SAY

20:05.121 --> 20:07.247
THAT, UM, YOU GUYS NAILED

20:07.289 --> 20:10.250
THE "SEXIEST MAN ALIVE"

20:07.289 --> 20:10.250
AGAIN THIS YEAR.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.335
AND IF I'M A SHEEP,

20:10.292 --> 20:11.335
I'M JUST GLAD

20:11.377 --> 20:13.046
THAT YOU ALL

20:11.377 --> 20:13.046
ARE MY SHEPHERDS,

20:13.087 --> 20:14.505
AND I'M SURE

20:13.087 --> 20:14.505
THAT MY MOTHER IS...

20:14.547 --> 20:16.841
(Southern accent) SHOVING THIS

20:14.547 --> 20:16.841
DOWN HER GIRDLE RIGHT NOW...

20:16.883 --> 20:18.885
(normal voice) AS WE SPEAK,

20:16.883 --> 20:18.885
SO THANK YOU.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.929
(sighs) WELL, TEAM,

20:21.971 --> 20:23.430
WHAT CAN I SAY?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.432
MY JOB HERE WAS FAKE,

20:25.474 --> 20:28.561
BUT THE WORK THAT WE DID

20:25.474 --> 20:28.561
WAS REAL... ISH.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.270
BRENDA, WHAT CAN I SAY

20:28.602 --> 20:30.270
TO YOU, BRENDA?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.314
WHERE DO I EVEN START?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.314
(chuckles)

20:32.356 --> 20:34.441
I KNOW I'VE BEEN

20:32.356 --> 20:34.441
ESPECIALLY HARD ON YOU,

20:34.483 --> 20:37.570
BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE I SEE

20:34.483 --> 20:37.570
SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.239
(voice breaking) YOU'RE

20:37.611 --> 20:40.239
THE BEST BOSS I EVER HAD.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.283
I DIDN'T WANT THINGS

20:41.490 --> 20:43.283
TO END THIS WAY,

20:43.325 --> 20:45.536
BUT ALL GOOD THINGS, RIGHT?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.287
WHEN YOU SPEAK OF ME

20:45.578 --> 20:47.287
AT THE COMPANY RETREAT,

20:47.329 --> 20:48.372
WHICH I STILL PLAN

20:47.329 --> 20:48.372
ON ATTENDING,

20:48.414 --> 20:50.374
SPEAK OF ME WELL.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.710
I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN BAJA.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.921
(clicks switch)

20:54.962 --> 20:57.297
UH, WE'RE STILL WORKING!

20:57.339 --> 20:58.257
YOU'RE FIRED!

20:57.339 --> 20:58.257
(door slams)

21:02.053 --> 21:04.013
CAN I GET A WATER?

21:02.053 --> 21:04.013
(man) WATER FOR JAMES.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.306
WATER, PLEASE. THANK YOU.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.306
ALL RIGHT, GREAT. GOOD JOB.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.475
NOW CAN YOU GET ME ONE

21:06.348 --> 21:08.475
THAT'S NOT HOT AS HELLFIRE?

21:08.517 --> 21:09.602
(shutter clicking)

21:09.643 --> 21:11.562
DONNIE, YEAH.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.981
I JUST SAW THE HORSE'S TRAILER.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.981
IT'S BIGGER THAN MINE.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.358
AND GO BY STAR SIZE,

21:14.023 --> 21:16.358
NOT BODY SIZE.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.153
(blusters)

21:19.195 --> 21:21.030
IS THAT SECRETARIAT?

21:19.195 --> 21:21.030
OH, IT'S NOT?

21:21.072 --> 21:22.698
'CAUSE THE WAY

21:21.072 --> 21:22.698
EVERYONE'S FAWNING OVER HIM,

21:22.740 --> 21:23.824
I THOUGHT IT MUST BE.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.326
DONNIE, LISTEN, YEAH.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.620
I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS HORSE.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.329
I WANT YOU TO SEND HIM

21:27.661 --> 21:29.329
A GIFT BASKET FROM ME--

21:29.371 --> 21:32.291
SEASON ONE OF "LUCK"

21:29.371 --> 21:32.291
AND A BIG TUB OF GLUE.
