54:41.656 --> 54:44.158
said to hold all the
answers about the past.

54:56.372 --> 54:58.471

54:58.473 --> 55:01.043

the source of her magic.</i>

what are you doing?

55:31.440 --> 55:33.140
This is my fault.

55:33.142 --> 55:35.743
They were looking
for answers about me.

55:35.745 --> 55:39.079
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

55:39.081 --> 55:41.083
No. Just their deaths.

55:41.384 --> 55:43.083
Stop. No.

55:43.085 --> 55:45.819
Yelena asked,
why would the spirits

55:45.821 --> 55:48.521
reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?

55:48.523 --> 55:51.992
Because our mother
saved our father.

55:51.994 --> 55:54.028
She saved her enemy.

55:54.030 --> 55:58.332
Her good deed
was rewarded with you.

55:58.334 --> 56:00.034
You are a gift.

56:00.036 --> 56:01.301
For what?

56:01.303 --> 56:03.603
If anyone can resolve
the past...

56:03.605 --> 56:06.940
if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest,

56:06.942 --> 56:08.475
it's you.

56:08.477 --> 56:12.782
I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything.

56:19.554 --> 56:22.156
Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit.

56:22.158 --> 56:25.492
A bridge between
the magic of nature and us.

56:25.494 --> 56:26.894
A fifth spirit?

56:26.896 --> 56:29.963
That's who's been calling
me from Ahtohallan.

56:29.965 --> 56:33.069
The answers about the
past are all there.

56:33.803 --> 56:35.171
So we go to Ahtohallan.

56:36.439 --> 56:37.840

56:38.507 --> 56:40.007
- Me.
- ANNA: What?

56:40.009 --> 56:42.476
The Dark Sea is too
dangerous for us both.

56:42.478 --> 56:45.345
No. No!
We do this together.

56:45.347 --> 56:46.713

56:46.715 --> 56:48.916
"Go too far and
you'll be drowned."

56:48.918 --> 56:51.285
Who will stop you
from going too far?

56:51.287 --> 56:52.519
You said you believed in me,

56:52.521 --> 56:54.054
that this is
what I was born to do.

56:54.056 --> 56:57.324
And I don't wanna
stop you from that.

56:57.326 --> 56:59.426

wanna stop you

56:59.428 --> 57:01.295

you need to be.

this might sound crazy...

57:46.976 --> 57:49.510
but I'm sensing
some rising anger.

57:49.512 --> 57:51.979

Well, I am angry, Olaf!

57:51.981 --> 57:54.748

we'd do this together!

57:54.750 --> 57:56.283
Yeah. Uh-huh.

57:56.285 --> 58:00.354
But what I mean is,
I'm sensing rising anger in me.

58:00.356 --> 58:02.389
Wait, you're angry?

58:02.391 --> 58:04.525
Um, I... I think so.

58:04.527 --> 58:06.493
Elsa pushed me away,
too,

58:06.495 --> 58:09.163
and didn't even
say goodbye.

58:09.165 --> 58:12.665
And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her.

58:12.667 --> 58:15.269

never change.

58:15.271 --> 58:16.637
But since then,

58:16.639 --> 58:19.808

but change.

Too entitled.

can defy the will of a king.
