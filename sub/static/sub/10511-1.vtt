00:20.024 --> 00:22.149
What is happen to this city?

00:22.483 --> 00:25.524
Ashes here, smoke there.

00:26.274 --> 00:28.274
Why are you so silent?

00:28.649 --> 00:31.608
Why have smoke forced
down your throat?

00:31.858 --> 00:34.399
Now it's the limit of endurance.

00:34.524 --> 00:37.649
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

00:38.024 --> 00:40.399
Smoking is banned
in all public places.

00:40.733 --> 00:43.149
Violation will lead to penalty.

00:43.274 --> 00:45.274
Don't smoke.

00:45.358 --> 00:47.024
No let anyone do.

00:47.608 --> 00:49.774
Smoking will cost you.

00:54.399 --> 00:56.358
Who doesn't want to be happy?

00:59.024 --> 01:01.524
But at what price?

01:02.358 --> 01:05.274
Smoking will cost you.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.649
Smoking can cost you your health.

01:13.108 --> 01:15.274
And for your dear ones.

01:19.608 --> 01:20.524
Smoking will cost you.

02:59.149 --> 03:00.983
'How many were they?'

03:07.941 --> 03:09.733
"Do whatever you want."

03:09.816 --> 03:11.524
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

03:11.608 --> 03:13.483
"Be a little scared, son."

03:13.566 --> 03:15.316
"Or Gabbar will show up."

03:15.399 --> 03:17.149
"Do whatever you want."

03:17.233 --> 03:19.024
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

03:19.108 --> 03:20.816
"Be a little scared, son."

03:20.899 --> 03:22.816
"Or Gabbar will show up."

03:23.191 --> 03:24.983
"Gabbar."

03:25.066 --> 03:26.691
"Gabbar."

03:26.899 --> 03:28.524
"Gabbar."

03:28.691 --> 03:30.316
"Gabbar will be happy."

03:30.399 --> 03:32.191
"This is not a comic or a game."

03:32.274 --> 03:34.233
"He's not the Spider or Superman."

03:34.316 --> 03:36.024
"He roams the streets
at night for your safety."

03:36.108 --> 03:37.858
"Gabbar is the better man."

03:38.191 --> 03:39.691
"Gabbar is a brave-heart."

03:39.774 --> 03:40.691
"When the lion walks
in the jungle.."

03:40.774 --> 03:41.566
"..the scavengers
make themselves scarce."

03:41.649 --> 03:43.024
"This lion hunts only those.."

03:43.108 --> 03:45.483
"..who make money the wrong way."

03:45.566 --> 03:47.608
Even 50 miles away..

03:47.691 --> 03:49.399
...when someone takes a bribe..

03:49.483 --> 03:50.441
<i>--</i> People say..

03:50.524 --> 03:51.691
"Don't take it, or..

03:51.774 --> 03:52.691
...Gabbar will show up."

03:52.774 --> 03:54.566
"Evil only begets evil."

03:54.649 --> 03:56.316
"There's still time
so straighten up now."

03:56.441 --> 03:57.316
"And if you don't.."

03:57.399 --> 04:00.316
"..you'll get a one
way ticket to hell."

04:00.399 --> 04:01.899
"Don't make this mistake."

04:01.983 --> 04:03.774
"Save your head."

04:03.858 --> 04:05.899
"if you want to sleep
at nights, then.."

04:05.983 --> 04:07.566
"..be afraid of Gabbar."

04:07.816 --> 04:09.774
"Do whatever you want."

04:09.858 --> 04:11.649
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

04:11.733 --> 04:13.441
"Be a little scared, son."

04:13.524 --> 04:15.316
"Or Gabbar will show up."

04:15.399 --> 04:17.024
"Do whatever you want."

04:17.108 --> 04:18.774
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

04:18.858 --> 04:20.649
"Be a little scared, son."

04:20.733 --> 04:22.608
"Or Gabbar will show up."

04:23.191 --> 04:24.816
"Gabbar."

04:25.024 --> 04:26.608
"Gabbar."

04:26.858 --> 04:28.399
"Gabbar."

04:28.649 --> 04:30.108
"He'll be proud of you."

04:30.358 --> 04:32.108
"Gabbar."

04:32.399 --> 04:33.733
"Gabbar."

04:34.233 --> 04:36.024
"Gabbar."

04:37.149 --> 04:39.149
"Do whatever you want."

04:39.233 --> 04:41.066
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

04:41.149 --> 04:42.899
"Be a little scared, son."

04:42.983 --> 04:45.108
"Or Gabbar will show up."

04:45.608 --> 04:49.149
'Deeds of a hero..
name of a villain.'

05:05.899 --> 05:07.899
How many were they?

05:08.649 --> 05:11.233
Two, chief.

05:19.483 --> 05:21.066
Two men..

05:21.649 --> 05:23.649
Pig heads!

05:25.149 --> 05:26.733
For the people of Latur,
we bring you..

05:26.899 --> 05:29.566
The queen of 'Once more'.. Devyani.

05:29.858 --> 05:33.774
"The way I mesmerized him!"

05:36.233 --> 05:40.649
"The way I mesmerized him!
That wrestler was stunned."

05:40.733 --> 05:43.733
"The bomb of youth has exploded!"

05:43.816 --> 05:47.858
"The bomb of youth
has blasted the world is shocked."

05:48.066 --> 05:51.733
"The bomb of youth has exploded!"

06:29.608 --> 06:30.774
Get up! Get UP!

06:30.858 --> 06:32.399
Quiet.
- Who are you?

06:33.274 --> 06:35.066
Take whatever you want.

06:35.483 --> 06:37.191
We want your husband.
- Take him.

06:37.274 --> 06:38.691
Come on.

07:30.316 --> 07:31.316
Hello.. What?

07:31.399 --> 07:33.358
Nanded's Collector
has been kidnapped, sir.

07:33.858 --> 07:34.649
What?

07:34.816 --> 07:36.941
Sir, Nashik's Collector
has been kidnapped.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.441
Nashik?

07:38.691 --> 07:40.358
No, you mean Nanded.

07:40.524 --> 07:42.483
Don't confuse us.

07:42.983 --> 07:44.358
Sir, Vijay's calling from Nashik.

07:44.524 --> 07:46.191
Nashik's Collector
has been kidnapped.

07:46.441 --> 07:47.608
Sir, news from Latur.

07:47.691 --> 07:49.149
There's been a kidnapping.

07:49.608 --> 07:50.733
<i>Sh", Sangâ too.</i>

07:51.608 --> 07:53.441
Listen..this is front page news.

07:53.524 --> 07:54.149
Stop the press!

07:54.233 --> 07:55.274
Stop the press right now!

07:58.399 --> 08:00.983
Maharashtra in great danger.

08:01.066 --> 08:03.691
10 collectors
go missing overnight.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.858
The police have setup
check posts across the state..

08:05.941 --> 08:07.733
...after the kidnapping
of the Collectors.

08:08.358 --> 08:09.899
Everyone is asking
the same question.

08:10.149 --> 08:12.108
Who is behind this?

08:12.774 --> 08:16.608
'Only one man can save
you from Gabbar's fury.'

08:16.816 --> 08:18.191
'Only one man.'

08:19.108 --> 08:20.524
'Gabbar himself.'

08:56.066 --> 09:00.149
Sir..10 Collectors
go missing suddenly..

09:00.233 --> 09:02.566
...and the Home Ministry
hasn't issued any statement yet.

09:02.649 --> 09:03.941
This incident
happened three days ago, sir.

09:04.024 --> 09:05.399
Can you tell me
what you are all doing?

09:05.483 --> 09:07.316
Look, we're
investigating the matter.

09:07.524 --> 09:10.149
Soon we'll know who
is behind all this.

09:11.149 --> 09:12.108
Sir.

09:14.691 --> 09:17.983
Mr. Minister, the role of
the police is being questioned..

09:18.066 --> 09:19.441
...what are your comments on it?

09:19.524 --> 09:22.108
I've organized
a Special Task Force.

09:22.191 --> 09:24.274
And Commissioner Panth
is heading this team.

09:26.316 --> 09:26.983
What?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.191
Don't worry, sir.

09:28.274 --> 09:29.441
We'll find the Collectors.

09:29.524 --> 09:30.899
I am there.
- I see.

09:30.983 --> 09:31.524
Jai Hind, sir.

09:31.608 --> 09:32.899
We just received news, sir.

09:32.983 --> 09:34.566
All the Collectors have returned..

09:34.649 --> 09:35.524
...to the places from
where they were kidnapped.

09:35.608 --> 09:37.399
Oh..good news.

09:37.566 --> 09:39.274
Let's announce
this quickly. - Sir..

09:39.358 --> 09:40.608
There's a problem.

09:40.691 --> 09:42.858
Only nine of them have returned.

09:43.608 --> 09:44.191
What?

09:44.274 --> 09:45.233
Where's the 10th one?

09:53.524 --> 09:54.649
Go up.

10:15.399 --> 10:18.108
Bribe has
become like an offering.

10:18.441 --> 10:20.858
It's become a necessity to
offer one before doing anything.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.358
Every Legal Department..

10:23.441 --> 10:25.983
...has turned the life of
every common man like a newspaper.

10:26.733 --> 10:28.858
It starts with turning
the pages on the commode.

10:29.608 --> 10:30.774
And by nightfall..

10:30.941 --> 10:33.191
...it's lying in some
corner like waste.

10:34.358 --> 10:35.899
But no more.

10:36.483 --> 10:41.149
Every Friday, one government
officer will be relieved.

10:42.649 --> 10:45.816
Either from corruption,
or this world.

10:47.483 --> 10:48.691
And yes..

10:49.441 --> 10:52.358
I am neither
legal..nor illegal.

10:52.858 --> 10:55.899
I am not
a politician..nor terrorist.

10:56.733 --> 10:59.566
Deeds of a hero..
name of a villain.

11:00.191 --> 11:02.608
I am..Gabbar.

11:03.566 --> 11:04.733
Gabbar.

11:06.316 --> 11:08.441
Everyone's
deed will be revealed.

11:08.983 --> 11:12.483
You see..Karma
cannot be bribed.

11:14.983 --> 11:16.816
This CD shouldn't
leak out at any cost.

11:16.899 --> 11:20.566
Just now a person called Gabbar
has sent a CD to our channel.

11:20.649 --> 11:22.649
Let's hear what's on the CD.

11:22.733 --> 11:23.691
This is the CD of Gabbar..

11:23.774 --> 11:25.066
...which is available at
every corner of the country.

11:25.149 --> 11:26.649
Look at the huge crowd..

11:26.733 --> 11:27.649
...which has gathered
around to buy this CD.

11:27.733 --> 11:28.483
And not just that..

11:28.566 --> 11:30.649
...this video has gone viral
on all social media sites..

11:30.733 --> 11:32.608
...and it's been shared by everyone.

11:32.691 --> 11:33.649
I'm the Gabbar.

11:33.733 --> 11:37.608
Will killing a middle-aged
man solve corruption?

11:38.024 --> 11:41.024
No. I think this is right.

11:41.941 --> 11:45.024
Don't you see,
corruption has turned into a race.

11:45.483 --> 11:50.816
And anyway, if the winner
gets death in the end..

11:51.066 --> 11:55.066
...then, they will all
start running backwards.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.983
How did those Collectors
take the money..

11:57.233 --> 11:59.233
...what time.. and from whom.

11:59.566 --> 12:01.274
And how they used that money..

12:01.358 --> 12:02.566
...where they invested that money.

12:02.774 --> 12:04.691
He's also got a copy
of their property papers.

12:05.316 --> 12:08.108
Sir, this Gabbar has
done a CBI level inquiry.

12:08.191 --> 12:09.066
Yes, sir.

12:09.149 --> 12:12.483
No outsider can gather
all this information.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.899
Someone's definitely giving
him all this information..

12:14.983 --> 12:16.733
...from inside the office.

12:17.108 --> 12:19.108
Who could it be?
- Sir, it can be someone..

12:19.191 --> 12:21.233
I get it, sir.

12:22.441 --> 12:23.941
I get it.

12:25.941 --> 12:28.524
10 kidnappings. 10 officers.

12:28.691 --> 12:30.316
This means a team of 10 people.

12:33.816 --> 12:35.149
This isn't the job of 10 people.

12:35.399 --> 12:38.941
Sadhu, you talk more
than you're paid for.

12:39.233 --> 12:40.233
Tell me something.

12:40.608 --> 12:43.233
How many Collectors in Maharashtra?
- How many?

12:43.316 --> 12:44.066
354.

12:44.608 --> 12:46.608
And how many did they abduct?
- How many?

12:46.691 --> 12:48.983
10.
- Yes, 10? So.

12:50.274 --> 12:52.816
One man is enough to plan everything.

12:53.524 --> 12:55.608
But how many men do
you need for the kidnapping.

12:56.274 --> 12:59.649
One man alone can't change the tires.
- Correct.

12:59.733 --> 13:02.191
You need at least 2-3
people to abduct someone.

13:02.483 --> 13:03.816
So how many for 10 people?

13:04.316 --> 13:05.274
20-30?

13:06.233 --> 13:08.399
This is the job of an organization.

13:08.649 --> 13:10.316
They don't hide in the
jungles like the Renegades..

13:10.399 --> 13:12.858
...in fact, they're operating
right here from the city.

13:12.941 --> 13:15.691
And you're not doing your job.
- My job?

13:15.774 --> 13:19.316
Get some fritters quickly.
- That fatso will explode someday.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.983
And don't forget the red sauce.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.149
Last time you forgot,
and I had to face the music.

13:26.316 --> 13:28.566
These people will keep
pouring sauce on their fritters..

13:29.233 --> 13:30.941
...and Gabbar will do his thing.

13:32.191 --> 13:34.108
Hurry up,
Adi sir's class is about to begin.

13:34.191 --> 13:35.316
Come on.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.524
Is everyone here?

13:37.816 --> 13:39.899
Let's take attendance.
- Forget it, sir.

13:39.983 --> 13:41.274
There must be more than you expect.

13:41.358 --> 13:43.191
Who would want to bunk your class?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.774
Is that sure?
- Definitely.

13:45.858 --> 13:46.816
Fine, let it be.

13:49.899 --> 13:51.649
The world is made of five elements..

13:51.899 --> 13:53.524
...and so is our body.

13:54.108 --> 13:57.566
And similarly,
Force is made of five elements.

13:57.816 --> 14:00.858
Can anyone tell me
what the elements are?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.066
No, sir.

14:02.774 --> 14:03.649
No?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.358
Listen carefully.

14:05.483 --> 14:06.941
It's Tension.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.274
Compression!

14:08.441 --> 14:09.274
Sheer!

14:09.483 --> 14:10.149
Bending!

14:10.233 --> 14:11.941
And..Twisting!

14:12.233 --> 14:14.108
If we translate this in Hindi..

14:14.399 --> 14:15.566
...we'll call it..

14:15.649 --> 14:16.524
'Khichav' Tension.

14:16.691 --> 14:17.399
'Dabav' Compression!

14:17.608 --> 14:18.108
'Tod' Sheer!

14:18.191 --> 14:18.774
'Mod' Bending!

14:18.858 --> 14:20.816
And.. 'Ghumav' Twisting!

14:22.191 --> 14:23.233
Didn't get it?

14:23.316 --> 14:24.024
No, sir.

14:24.108 --> 14:26.066
Well, let me explain it practically.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.108
Come on, get lost.

14:36.191 --> 14:38.608
Get lost, college is closed.

14:38.691 --> 14:40.233
Get lost. Come on.

14:40.316 --> 14:41.983
Get lost. Come on.

14:42.191 --> 14:43.608
Young man, come up.

14:44.816 --> 14:46.024
Listen carefully.

14:46.358 --> 14:48.941
Without moving your
feet.. Raise your hand.

14:49.608 --> 14:50.983
Try to push me.

14:51.066 --> 14:52.899
College is closed.

14:52.983 --> 14:53.858
Get lost.

14:53.941 --> 14:55.899
Hey teacher,
college is closed today.

14:56.274 --> 14:57.733
Come on, get out.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.941
Go, go..

15:01.024 --> 15:01.941
College is closed.

15:02.024 --> 15:03.233
Come on, get out.

15:03.316 --> 15:03.899
Come on.

15:03.983 --> 15:04.691
Doesn't this look like..

15:04.774 --> 15:06.274
...two bulls are clashing each other.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.816
This is called 'Compression Load'.

15:09.899 --> 15:10.941
What is it called? Louder?

15:11.024 --> 15:12.524
'Compression Load'.
- Perfect.

15:12.608 --> 15:14.108
So first you learned 'Tension Load'..

15:14.149 --> 15:16.649
...and now 'Compression Load'.
- Hey..enough of your antics.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.316
Go back.

15:19.566 --> 15:20.774
Go home.

15:21.441 --> 15:22.774
Come on.

15:23.358 --> 15:25.399
Come with us. Come on.

15:25.483 --> 15:27.566
The college won't shut down.
Who are you?

15:27.649 --> 15:29.899
Some Gabbar has killed the Collector.

15:29.983 --> 15:31.691
This isn't Law and Order.

15:31.774 --> 15:33.483
The Home Minister has to resign.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.608
Until then..
- The exam schedules are already out.

15:35.774 --> 15:37.149
This college won't shut down.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.816
I see..the college won't close down!

15:38.899 --> 15:39.774
Break everything.

15:39.858 --> 15:40.983
Come on.
- Now it will shut down.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.358
We won't tolerate this hooliganism.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.358
You want to see hooliganism.

15:45.816 --> 15:47.149
This is the third Force.

15:47.233 --> 15:48.358
Listen carefully.

15:48.608 --> 15:50.691
When you press something
from both sides..

15:50.774 --> 15:55.566
...and put pressure
on its Tension point.

15:55.816 --> 15:56.733
Break it!

15:56.816 --> 15:58.233
Should I break it?
- Break it!

15:58.316 --> 16:00.191
Fine, now watch the breaking force.

16:00.274 --> 16:01.566
Break it!

16:03.524 --> 16:04.066
Who are you?

16:04.149 --> 16:05.024
You're done for.

16:11.108 --> 16:12.524
This is Bending.

16:13.399 --> 16:17.233
Now..I'll teach you
about Twisting Force.

16:17.316 --> 16:19.524
Aditya! What are you doing, sir?

16:19.774 --> 16:21.483
I was just taking my class, sir.

16:21.566 --> 16:23.316
Stop it! Leave him!

16:26.774 --> 16:30.149
As you all saw,
Physics is useful in everything.

16:30.566 --> 16:33.524
Tension. Compression. Sheer. Bending..

16:33.608 --> 16:35.816
...and the last one,
sorry I couldn't show you.

16:35.899 --> 16:36.816
Twisting.

16:37.066 --> 16:38.483
And listen all of you.

16:39.858 --> 16:42.233
Even the Police aren't
allowed inside this campus.

16:42.941 --> 16:44.483
And you are all goons.

16:44.649 --> 16:46.274
So don't even think
about it next time.

16:46.358 --> 16:47.066
Understand.

16:48.024 --> 16:48.983
What did he say?

16:49.066 --> 16:51.399
Even the Police aren't
allowed inside the campus.

16:51.649 --> 16:53.691
So how did the goons get in?

16:54.066 --> 16:56.691
The college gate
is the problem, right?

16:56.858 --> 16:58.024
What if the gate isn't there anymore?

16:58.399 --> 16:59.483
Break down the gate.

17:19.066 --> 17:21.566
None of you ever went to school..

17:22.608 --> 17:24.733
...that's why you want to
break down this college gate.

17:25.398 --> 17:29.399
Come fellas,
it's time for your roll call.

17:29.524 --> 17:30.399
Come on.

17:38.733 --> 17:39.816
What's your age?

17:39.899 --> 17:41.108
What's your age?

17:41.483 --> 17:42.233
What's your age?

17:42.316 --> 17:43.483
I know yours.

17:43.566 --> 17:44.483
No, sir.

17:44.566 --> 17:46.149
Sir, he told me to.

18:44.316 --> 18:48.024
I will never go near
any college again.

18:48.191 --> 18:51.524
Good boy, you've learn enough.

18:53.274 --> 18:55.191
Class dismissed!

18:59.733 --> 19:01.941
Hey..stop!

19:02.941 --> 19:04.483
Stop!

19:15.149 --> 19:16.649
Madam, are you crazy?
- Shut up.

19:16.733 --> 19:18.566
I need your car, just wait.

19:18.941 --> 19:20.358
Come on, hurry up.
- Don't worry.

19:20.441 --> 19:22.941
Careful. Slowly.

19:23.108 --> 19:24.066
Madhu, don't worry.

19:24.149 --> 19:26.274
What are you waiting for?
Open the door.

19:26.483 --> 19:27.358
Come on.

19:28.524 --> 19:29.649
It's okay, come on.

19:30.066 --> 19:32.149
Madhu, sit comfortably.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.066
Get to the hospital, okay.
- Yes.

19:34.191 --> 19:35.816
Never seen a pregnant lady before?

19:35.899 --> 19:36.858
Let's go quickly.

19:37.608 --> 19:38.066
Come on.

19:38.149 --> 19:39.816
Keep breathing, it's all okay.

19:39.941 --> 19:41.816
Come on, fast.

19:41.899 --> 19:42.816
Take the next left.

19:44.774 --> 19:45.441
Keep breathing.

19:45.524 --> 19:46.566
Right, take a right.

19:46.858 --> 19:48.858
Just a little longer, hold on.

19:48.941 --> 19:50.191
Take the next left.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.566
Look forward, what are you staring at?

19:53.566 --> 19:54.816
We returned home from the party..

19:54.899 --> 19:56.066
...and her labor pains started.

19:56.316 --> 19:57.858
No one's up for doing
a good deed these days.

19:57.941 --> 19:59.941
No one bothered to stop their car.

20:00.358 --> 20:01.816
Thank God you came.

20:02.108 --> 20:04.608
Keep breathing, Madhu.
Keep breathing.

20:05.191 --> 20:07.024
Stop! Stop! Stop!

20:07.108 --> 20:08.399
Stop the car!

20:11.024 --> 20:14.191
I think her water just broke.

20:14.274 --> 20:16.191
I will have to deliver
the baby right here.

20:16.524 --> 20:18.691
Are you a doctor?
- No, I am a lawyer.

20:18.774 --> 20:20.524
But I've done research on Google.

20:20.608 --> 20:21.858
Get down from the car, please.

20:22.399 --> 20:24.691
Are you sure?
- Do I look like I am joking?

20:24.774 --> 20:26.524
Get down from the car.
Get down.

20:27.941 --> 20:29.816
Okay..now, ready?

20:33.649 --> 20:34.899
Come on, keep breathing.

20:36.274 --> 20:37.233
Come on..

20:41.358 --> 20:42.316
Hello.

20:43.441 --> 20:44.399
Yes, Ravi.

20:44.483 --> 20:45.358
Okay ready.

20:45.441 --> 20:46.691
Now push.

20:47.483 --> 20:50.066
Did you prepare the
list for Nagpur and Pune?

20:52.233 --> 20:52.983
Okay.

20:53.066 --> 20:54.108
Keep it ready.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.649
Excuse me, mister.
I need your shirt.

21:10.941 --> 21:11.899
What?

21:11.983 --> 21:14.316
Take off your shirt, quickly.

21:19.316 --> 21:20.149
Give it.

21:25.483 --> 21:28.233
Excuse me, mister. Come here.

21:47.733 --> 21:50.983
What's wrong with you?

21:51.066 --> 21:52.566
Come on, we've to get to the hospital.

21:52.649 --> 21:54.191
Come here.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.899
Baby.-

22:00.608 --> 22:01.774
Doctor, I cut the umbilical cord..

22:01.858 --> 22:03.691
...with a Swiss army knife,
is that okay?

22:03.774 --> 22:04.733
It's okay.
- Okay.

22:04.816 --> 22:05.858
Don't worry.. you go.

22:05.941 --> 22:07.233
I hope she's okay, doctor.

22:07.399 --> 22:09.024
Hurry up and take her in.
- Okay.

22:15.399 --> 22:18.024
Shruti..how is Madhu?
- Don't ask.

22:18.108 --> 22:19.816
I had to deliver the child on the way.

22:19.899 --> 22:22.524
I wasn't this tensed
even during my bar exams.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.941
Anyway, everything is okay now.

22:25.483 --> 22:27.649
Oh God, bless that man.

22:28.816 --> 22:30.774
I forgot all about him. Excuse me..

22:30.858 --> 22:31.399
Shruti.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.358
Excuse me.. Hello!

22:35.649 --> 22:37.149
I wonder who he was.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.899
Like they say..
This is how Angels come.

22:42.274 --> 22:43.649
He really was an angel.

22:43.858 --> 22:44.858
He's a devil.

22:44.941 --> 22:47.233
The other 9 Collectors
have gone blank..

22:47.608 --> 22:49.899
...like someone's erased
their memory card.

22:49.983 --> 22:51.899
They were locked in
a dark room for three days.

22:51.983 --> 22:53.608
And suddenly they were released.

22:53.691 --> 22:55.066
Now nobody's uttering a single word.

22:55.149 --> 22:56.483
Sir, these are officers.

22:56.566 --> 22:57.899
We can't be strict with them either.

22:57.983 --> 22:59.983
I don't want to hear this or that.

23:00.274 --> 23:03.066
If someone's got an idea,
then speak now.

23:06.941 --> 23:09.066
Sir. Sir.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.191
Why are you raising your hand?

23:15.233 --> 23:17.149
Sir was asking if
someone's got an idea.

23:17.566 --> 23:19.524
Who are you?
- Constable Sadhuram.

23:19.608 --> 23:20.524
I am Yadav sir's driver.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.399
I brought his medicine. Digestion.

23:22.649 --> 23:23.566
So why did you raise your hand?

23:23.649 --> 23:25.649
Sir, I have an idea.
- I've got 'Airtel'.

23:25.733 --> 23:26.608
Come here.

23:27.358 --> 23:28.274
Come here.

23:29.649 --> 23:30.524
Bravo.

23:30.941 --> 23:32.483
You brought my medicine, didn't you?

23:32.774 --> 23:35.024
Now get us some fritters.

23:35.108 --> 23:36.649
Yes.
- Run along.

23:37.066 --> 23:39.608
Sir, in every office..
- Hey, Sadhu.

23:39.816 --> 23:42.149
You're a driver, aren't you?
So act like one.

23:42.608 --> 23:44.858
Drive the car,
don't rack your brains.

23:45.108 --> 23:49.649
Sir, I was just..
- Hey..do you think you're James Bond.

23:49.733 --> 23:51.524
Did you ever take a look
at yourself in the mirror?

23:52.066 --> 23:53.108
Get out, come on.

23:53.191 --> 23:54.691
Get lost..

23:54.941 --> 23:58.274
Sir, if you just listen to me..
- Have you gone deaf?

23:58.358 --> 23:59.191
Get out.

23:59.399 --> 24:01.024
Didn't you hear?
Get out.

24:01.858 --> 24:02.983
Sir.

24:05.733 --> 24:08.483
Hey fool, don't forget the red sauce.

24:09.899 --> 24:11.399
My driver's become James Bond.

24:16.441 --> 24:16.941
Sadhu!

24:17.024 --> 24:17.733
Sadhu!

24:17.816 --> 24:18.858
Hey, Sadhu!

24:18.941 --> 24:21.358
Why do you lock horns
with these officers?

24:22.483 --> 24:23.941
Officers? My foot.

24:24.149 --> 24:26.524
100 meters in 15 seconds,
can they do it? No.

24:26.608 --> 24:27.983
100% in UPSC, CFPF.

24:28.066 --> 24:29.399
Can they do it? No.

24:29.816 --> 24:30.983
100% of everything.

24:31.066 --> 24:32.983
100 ideas to give my best shot, but..

24:33.816 --> 24:35.899
Bribe wins against talent, so I lost.

24:36.149 --> 24:37.608
Do you get angry in English?

24:39.274 --> 24:40.524
I am not angry.

24:41.566 --> 24:43.108
Law runs through my blood.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.316
All my ancestors were in the police.

24:45.399 --> 24:47.608
I was selected for
Sub-Inspector, but..

24:48.066 --> 24:49.774
...since I couldn't pay bribe,
I became a constable.

24:50.941 --> 24:53.941
But..by solving this case..

24:54.191 --> 24:56.899
...I will earn my cap of an inspector.

24:58.024 --> 24:59.608
How will you solve this case?

24:59.816 --> 25:02.358
It's easy to spot the
anomaly in the crowd.

25:03.274 --> 25:04.066
Meaning?

25:04.149 --> 25:05.858
I mean one can easily
spot the honest one..

25:05.941 --> 25:07.191
...amongst the corrupt ones.

25:07.816 --> 25:11.399
I will go to every office
and find that one man.

25:11.733 --> 25:14.024
You're a driver,
why would they send you?

25:15.108 --> 25:16.274
I will take a medical leave.

25:16.566 --> 25:17.816
Medical leave?

25:18.733 --> 25:22.024
One small lie is okay
for exposing a big truth.

25:24.899 --> 25:25.983
Gabbar.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.566
I'll get him behind bars.

26:05.858 --> 26:08.149
Shruti madam, what have you done?

26:08.399 --> 26:09.774
You put a dent
on the boss' new car.

26:09.858 --> 26:10.899
What? Why are you screaming?

26:10.983 --> 26:12.608
He won't spare us.
We will all lose our jobs.

26:12.691 --> 26:14.483
I didn't do anything.
Why are you screaming?

26:14.566 --> 26:15.191
What happened, driver?

26:15.274 --> 26:17.608
Sir, Shruti madam slammed
into your parked car.

26:17.858 --> 26:18.774
I was drinking tea.

26:18.858 --> 26:20.108
I saw it with my own eyes.

26:20.483 --> 26:21.066
No, sir.

26:21.191 --> 26:23.274
Why don't you
learn to drive first?

26:23.358 --> 26:24.274
Look at this dent.

26:24.358 --> 26:25.691
You put a dent on my car,
now you will have to pay.

26:25.774 --> 26:28.649
Sir, I didn't put a dent
on your car..so why should I pay?

26:28.733 --> 26:31.608
My driver saw you,
with his own eyes.

26:31.816 --> 26:33.858
Eyes can be deceived too, sir.

26:33.941 --> 26:35.441
I can prove that I didn't do it.

26:35.566 --> 26:37.691
Give me two minutes, sir.
- Fine. I'll give you two minutes.

26:38.191 --> 26:40.649
You saw me put a dent on this car?
- Of course.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.483
You did it.
- Not at all.

26:42.566 --> 26:45.233
You took the car outside
and got this dent somewhere else..

26:45.316 --> 26:46.483
...and now you're blaming me.

26:46.566 --> 26:49.191
Sir, three days ago he wanted
to borrow 500 rupees from me..

26:49.274 --> 26:50.483
...to which I clearly refused.

26:50.691 --> 26:51.649
Did you not?

26:51.733 --> 26:53.774
Sir, I..
- Sir, according to Google..

26:53.858 --> 26:57.483
...80% men think women
don't know how to drive.

26:57.608 --> 27:00.108
That's why his testament
cannot be accepted..

27:00.191 --> 27:02.441
...because he's bias
against women drivers.

27:02.649 --> 27:04.316
Sir, I am innocent.

27:04.399 --> 27:05.524
Absolutely innocent.

27:05.608 --> 27:08.233
Sir, I know who put
a dent on your car. - Who?

27:08.441 --> 27:09.483
She did.
- Her?

27:09.566 --> 27:11.899
Yes.
- When did you see me do it?

27:11.983 --> 27:14.608
When you were driving
your scooty at 45 km/h.

27:14.691 --> 27:15.816
You lost your balance.

27:15.899 --> 27:18.441
You tried to apply the brakes,
but it was too late.

27:18.524 --> 27:20.566
You slammed your
scooty in his car.

27:20.649 --> 27:22.691
You're lying.
What proof do you have?

27:22.858 --> 27:23.441
Proof?

27:23.524 --> 27:24.608
Yes.
- You want proof?

27:24.733 --> 27:25.316
Yes.

27:25.483 --> 27:26.399
Sir, I have a suggestion.

27:26.483 --> 27:28.066
Let's go take
a look at her Scooty.

27:28.274 --> 27:29.983
It must still have
the paint of your car.

27:30.066 --> 27:30.691
Come on, sir.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.358
No..no need.
- Come on.

27:32.441 --> 27:32.899
Come on.

27:33.024 --> 27:34.483
Sir..why are you listening to him?

27:34.566 --> 27:36.774
Come on. - He's just a stranger.
Listen to me.

27:36.858 --> 27:38.483
See, sir..didn't I tell you?

27:38.733 --> 27:40.524
I have nothing
to do with this girl.

27:40.608 --> 27:41.899
I don't even know her.

27:42.066 --> 27:44.024
Nor did I borrow
any money from her.

27:44.441 --> 27:45.774
I have no agenda, sir.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.608
2500.
- Sir, that's more than my salary.

27:50.816 --> 27:53.316
All I have is 50 rupees.

27:53.399 --> 27:53.858
Sir..

27:53.941 --> 27:55.358
The rest will be deducted
from your salary.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.774
Sir..
- Driver, let's go.

27:56.858 --> 27:57.649
Get lost!

28:01.149 --> 28:02.483
Why did you have to intervene?

28:04.149 --> 28:05.691
Do you know that driver's salary?

28:06.483 --> 28:09.649
It's half of what you get paid.
- Oh, you're one of those.

28:09.733 --> 28:11.566
Yes, I am one of those.

28:11.774 --> 28:12.733
Hey, listen.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.774
Remember that kid
we delivered in the car.

28:14.983 --> 28:16.399
His naming ceremony is on Friday.

28:16.483 --> 28:17.566
You must come.

28:18.191 --> 28:19.566
We delivered a kid?

28:20.024 --> 28:21.149
The one in the car.

28:21.358 --> 28:23.066
We had a kid in the car.
- Shut up.

28:23.233 --> 28:24.566
By the way, I am Shruti.

28:24.649 --> 28:25.691
Gabbar.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.566
I am back!

28:33.233 --> 28:37.816
Our system has become
like children's diaper.

28:39.316 --> 28:41.024
Wet in some places..

28:41.608 --> 28:43.524
...and a little
loose in other places.

28:43.816 --> 28:46.358
There's only one
thing we do honestly.

28:46.983 --> 28:48.108
And that's corruption.

28:48.358 --> 28:51.108
Releasing this Friday..PWD.

28:51.441 --> 28:55.191
It's actually..
the Public Works Department.

28:55.524 --> 28:57.566
But due to some people..

28:57.649 --> 29:00.483
...it's been troubling
people the most.

29:00.941 --> 29:03.233
But now Gabbar will wield his PWD.

29:03.441 --> 29:04.733
<i>âPower-Wan Dandaâ (The Power Stick).</i>

29:04.816 --> 29:09.233
Power in wrong hands
can cause a blackout.

29:09.524 --> 29:11.483
2nd September.

29:12.066 --> 29:13.191
Remember this date.

29:13.399 --> 29:14.691
Because on this day..

29:15.608 --> 29:19.733
...one chair in PWD
will be vacated forever.

29:20.066 --> 29:21.649
Get lost, you dog.

29:21.733 --> 29:23.524
Don't let me see you here again.

29:23.816 --> 29:25.191
It's alright if
you don't want money..

29:25.274 --> 29:26.399
...but don't abuse me.

29:26.524 --> 29:27.941
This is wrong.
- What's wrong, mister?

29:29.983 --> 29:30.941
He's not ready to take bribe..

29:31.024 --> 29:32.108
...how will this country run?

29:32.358 --> 29:34.441
Corruption has retired
from this office.

29:37.649 --> 29:38.524
Why is that?

29:39.483 --> 29:41.024
If one man gets a heart-attack..

29:41.608 --> 29:44.316
...everyone in the
neighborhood starts jogging.

29:45.066 --> 29:47.066
Similarly,
since one Collector was murdered..

29:47.399 --> 29:48.649
...all the others
mended their ways.

29:48.816 --> 29:49.608
Go..

29:50.024 --> 29:51.608
Was everyone here
corrupt before that?

29:52.149 --> 29:53.149
Yes, all of them.

29:53.566 --> 29:54.858
Except for a handful.

29:55.858 --> 29:56.858
Who is that?

29:57.024 --> 30:01.149
Well..like that Anuj More.

30:02.399 --> 30:03.816
Anuj More? Who else?

30:06.899 --> 30:08.524
Everyone? You too?

30:11.649 --> 30:12.608
Yes, Laxmi.

30:12.691 --> 30:14.024
Sadhu, where are you?

30:14.108 --> 30:15.066
I am in Sangli.

30:15.566 --> 30:16.816
Gabbar's sent another CD.

30:19.358 --> 30:20.608
"2nd September."

30:21.899 --> 30:23.066
"Remember this date."

30:23.691 --> 30:24.816
"Because on this day.."

30:25.941 --> 30:29.858
..."one chair in PWD
will be vacated forever."

30:30.649 --> 30:31.941
"And all you corrupt people.."

30:33.358 --> 30:35.899
...if your heart starts
feeling restless..

30:35.983 --> 30:40.316
...then know that Gabbar
is somewhere close.

30:42.358 --> 30:43.983
What is his motive?

30:44.066 --> 30:44.941
Who is Gabbar?

30:45.024 --> 30:46.233
I am Gabbar.

30:46.316 --> 30:48.441
This is the film we
should be making, Mr. Producer.

30:48.524 --> 30:49.524
Can we get the rights?

30:49.774 --> 30:52.483
The police couldn't find him,
how can you?

30:52.566 --> 30:53.941
How will you join his group?

30:54.024 --> 30:54.524
Tell me.

30:54.608 --> 30:56.441
"Everyone has to pay in the end."

30:56.524 --> 30:58.316
"Be a little scared, son."

30:58.399 --> 31:00.149
"Or Gabbar will show up."

31:00.233 --> 31:02.441
"Do whatever you want."

31:02.524 --> 31:04.983
What's wrong, sir?
You look worried.

31:05.066 --> 31:06.274
Don't ask.

31:06.816 --> 31:09.566
Who knows which office
Gabbar is going to target next.

31:09.649 --> 31:11.233
It's making me sick.

31:11.816 --> 31:12.899
That's true, sir.

31:13.108 --> 31:15.524
If they make a list
of our department..

31:15.899 --> 31:18.691
...your name will be on the top.

31:19.358 --> 31:20.316
Isn't it?

31:20.566 --> 31:22.858
You had to rub it in, didn't you?

31:23.399 --> 31:27.608
I've no clue whether
my BP's getting high or low.

31:27.899 --> 31:29.649
And you're putting
salt on my wounds.

31:30.233 --> 31:32.066
And that Ramesh Pawar..
he's corrupt too.

31:32.149 --> 31:34.191
Sir, he's got 8.1 billion.

31:34.316 --> 31:35.983
But he's still 100
million short of you.

31:36.066 --> 31:39.608
Hey..10 again.
- Yes, so?

31:39.691 --> 31:42.649
Well..Gabbar kidnaps 10 people.

31:42.733 --> 31:44.524
Your lucky number is 10.

31:45.483 --> 31:47.149
Shut your mouth!

31:47.899 --> 31:49.483
What about that Raj Naik.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.441
Since the day Gabbar
killed that Collector..

31:51.524 --> 31:52.733
...everyone has
stopped taking bribes.

31:52.816 --> 31:56.733
Lord..Sai Baba protect me.

31:56.816 --> 31:57.774
Hello, sir.

32:01.024 --> 32:02.649
Sir, did you sign my file or not?

32:03.274 --> 32:05.233
We already gave you
15 million in advance.

32:05.316 --> 32:08.066
And here's the
rest of the 15 million.

32:08.441 --> 32:09.774
Thank God you're here.

32:10.024 --> 32:11.691
You gave me 15 million, right?

32:11.899 --> 32:12.774
Hold on.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.774
Here's your 15 million.

32:16.108 --> 32:16.983
Take it back.

32:17.066 --> 32:18.024
And come with me. - But..

32:18.108 --> 32:19.191
Come on. Come..
- But listen to me.

32:19.274 --> 32:20.524
Come on.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.108
Listen, everyone.

32:24.191 --> 32:25.441
Please listen..

32:25.524 --> 32:27.691
It's a question of
my life and death, please.

32:28.524 --> 32:31.441
Look,
someone from this department..

32:31.524 --> 32:33.899
...has been telling
Gabbar that I take bribes.

32:34.191 --> 32:35.983
And that's
why I have decided..

32:36.066 --> 32:37.941
...that I will
no longer take bribes.

32:38.399 --> 32:41.316
I took 15 million
from this contractor..

32:41.399 --> 32:42.608
...to get his job done.

32:42.733 --> 32:45.483
And I am
returning his money to him.

32:45.566 --> 32:46.483
Here you go.

32:46.816 --> 32:48.816
No, it's okay.
- Take it, mister.

32:48.899 --> 32:50.441
Do you want to get me killed?
Take it.

32:50.608 --> 32:53.983
I will sign your file,
if it's correct.

32:55.566 --> 33:00.941
I will return everyone's
money in cash.

33:01.191 --> 33:03.899
And those who sent
me money from outside..

33:03.983 --> 33:06.941
...I'll send their money
through money-order.

33:07.483 --> 33:08.941
Sir, we have only 24 hours.

33:09.108 --> 33:11.483
There are more than 2000
PWD officers in the state.

33:11.691 --> 33:13.191
We cannot provide
protection to everyone, sir.

33:14.066 --> 33:15.649
But we can protect
corrupt officers.

33:16.483 --> 33:17.524
Correct!

33:18.066 --> 33:19.233
Great idea, sir.

33:19.816 --> 33:21.066
Gabbar will go after them.

33:21.441 --> 33:24.233
Find out who are the
most corrupt officers of PWD.

33:24.316 --> 33:26.274
Sir, no officer will
ever claim that he's corrupt.

33:26.358 --> 33:27.108
Correct.

33:27.649 --> 33:29.483
Which fool will admit
that he's a thief?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.983
Honestly,
sir, I am the most corrupt officer.

33:32.066 --> 33:33.274
I need police protection.

33:33.358 --> 33:34.441
Look,
this is a list of my corruption.

33:34.524 --> 33:37.316
Hey..I've already
completely half century.

33:37.399 --> 33:38.816
50 million.

33:38.899 --> 33:40.899
Sir, please save me.

33:40.983 --> 33:42.899
My name is on the
top of Gabbar's list.

33:42.983 --> 33:45.441
Why? Did Gabbar fax you his list?

33:45.524 --> 33:46.483
Sir, please.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.691
Please.

33:48.024 --> 33:48.691
What?

33:48.774 --> 33:50.274
Sir, give me your account number.

33:50.858 --> 33:53.358
I'll give you
half of whatever I have.

33:53.441 --> 33:55.899
But enter my name in the
top 10 corruption list, please.

33:56.316 --> 33:58.566
And you want my name to be
on Gabbar's list, instead of you.

33:58.649 --> 33:59.733
Do you think I am crazy?

34:00.066 --> 34:00.858
Get in the line.

34:01.108 --> 34:02.566
Sir! Sir!

34:02.733 --> 34:04.858
Sir, while we were busy
giving protection to PWD..

34:04.941 --> 34:07.316
...Gabbar kidnapped
the District Collector.

34:07.399 --> 34:09.065
This was all a distraction, sir.

34:09.149 --> 34:10.065
Oh no.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.274
Alert all the police stations.

34:11.358 --> 34:13.608
Find out where he's keeping
the District Collector, okay.

34:13.690 --> 34:15.108
Sir, what about them?

34:15.315 --> 34:17.024
Collect all their files
and send it to the ACP.

34:17.108 --> 34:18.524
Don't spare anyone.

34:18.899 --> 34:22.608
Pawar! Close the gates.
Don't spare anyone.

34:23.483 --> 34:24.858
This is wrong, Thakur.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.608
When he said he will
abduct someone from PWD..

34:27.690 --> 34:29.774
...then, he should've
stuck to his word.

34:30.483 --> 34:31.858
He cheated us.

34:32.315 --> 34:33.483
It's not cheating, Yadav..

34:33.565 --> 34:35.399
...he tightened the
noose around all of them.

34:35.483 --> 34:38.483
And..he's Gabbar, not Gandhi.

34:49.858 --> 34:51.649
Do you know who I am?

34:53.565 --> 34:54.774
Gayanand Sawant.

34:54.858 --> 34:55.858
Vaibhav Munde.

34:56.024 --> 34:58.316
Parshuram Wadekar. Pramod Naiyyar.

34:58.816 --> 35:00.441
Do you know who they were?

35:04.608 --> 35:06.858
These four are
from the 877 farmers..

35:06.983 --> 35:09.399
...who committed suicide last year.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.983
Because the river water
which was meant for them..

35:14.483 --> 35:19.566
...was diverted to the
sugar factory, private sector..

35:20.149 --> 35:22.816
...and the Minister's farmhouse.

35:25.066 --> 35:28.191
And their fields remained dry.

35:29.233 --> 35:30.858
And in return..

35:32.358 --> 35:35.274
...you..received 180 million!

35:35.524 --> 35:37.441
I did exactly as the
Minister asked me to do.

35:37.899 --> 35:39.233
The Minister
was the one who paid me.

35:39.316 --> 35:40.858
Why should I
care about the Minister?

35:44.358 --> 35:47.233
Most of the politicians
in this country are illiterate.

35:47.483 --> 35:48.733
They are criminals.

35:49.066 --> 35:50.358
But you're a Collector.

35:50.566 --> 35:52.066
You were educated.

35:52.733 --> 35:55.191
You swore to serve the people.

35:55.524 --> 35:56.441
What were you doing?

35:56.649 --> 35:58.066
You very well know..

35:58.149 --> 36:00.608
...you could've saved
all those farmers lives.

36:03.441 --> 36:04.899
But what did you do?

36:06.524 --> 36:08.483
You took bribe from the Minister.

36:09.483 --> 36:12.983
Now you have to take..what
lam giving you.

36:14.358 --> 36:15.941
Listen to me..
Please. Please.

36:16.024 --> 36:17.066
Please, don't do this.

36:18.191 --> 36:20.024
Give me one chance.

36:20.108 --> 36:22.399
I swear I won't take bribes again.

36:22.483 --> 36:23.941
Sir, please..

36:24.358 --> 36:25.566
I am sorry, sir.

36:26.399 --> 36:28.691
The new password
for making mistakes.

36:31.358 --> 36:33.024
If sorry could fix everything..

36:33.108 --> 36:36.816
...then there would be no courts,
or police stations.

36:38.191 --> 36:40.566
I hate sorry's.

36:41.274 --> 36:44.191
Why was a government
officer hanged publicly?

36:44.274 --> 36:45.899
The hanging has
created a lot of stir..

36:45.983 --> 36:47.566
...in the state of Maharashtra.

36:47.858 --> 36:50.608
The police haven't
found any clue yet.

36:50.691 --> 36:52.441
There's terror in the city.

36:52.524 --> 36:54.191
Government officers
are clearly in fear.

36:54.274 --> 36:55.899
There's a stir amongst
the government officer.

37:01.733 --> 37:04.566
You were on the way,
when we first met.

37:05.233 --> 37:08.483
We've a big contribution
in your birth.

37:09.066 --> 37:11.274
Yes.

37:11.733 --> 37:12.899
Yes, baby.

37:13.399 --> 37:16.483
This is a small
token on my behalf.

37:17.108 --> 37:18.691
How cool, Adi.

37:19.233 --> 37:20.649
Do you like it?

37:21.108 --> 37:22.816
May I?
- Of course.

37:25.066 --> 37:25.941
<i>Okay . .</i>

37:27.191 --> 37:28.358
There you go.

37:29.066 --> 37:29.983
Okay.

37:30.066 --> 37:32.024
Please come here, Madhu.

37:48.274 --> 37:49.441
Return gift.

37:50.816 --> 37:53.399
Oh my baby.

37:54.483 --> 37:56.108
Take off your clothes.
- Huh?

37:56.358 --> 37:57.608
Take off your shirt.

37:58.774 --> 38:00.733
Every time we meet,
why do you make me take off my shirt?

38:00.983 --> 38:02.191
Take it off.

38:15.108 --> 38:16.566
Are you a murderer?

38:17.774 --> 38:18.399
What?

38:18.483 --> 38:20.149
You must do something similar.

38:20.483 --> 38:21.566
I didn't understand.

38:23.024 --> 38:24.149
This scar.

38:24.441 --> 38:25.441
It was an accident.

38:26.149 --> 38:27.816
Of course it
was an accident, stupid.

38:27.899 --> 38:29.316
That day when you
were holding the baby..

38:29.399 --> 38:31.149
...you had tears in your eyes.

38:31.233 --> 38:32.233
You're so sensitive..

38:32.316 --> 38:33.566
...how can you ever kill anyone.

38:55.441 --> 39:03.524
"Our eyes are meeting..
while sipping coffee."

39:06.358 --> 39:14.441
"Our eyes..are swaying
with the breeze of love."

39:17.191 --> 39:22.399
"This feeling right now..
feels really great."

39:22.608 --> 39:26.483
"it's the intoxication
of first love."

39:26.566 --> 39:28.024
"..of first love."

39:28.108 --> 39:30.649
"it's a new experience."

39:30.899 --> 39:33.149
"My eyes convey.."

39:33.649 --> 39:36.233
"Come dwell in my sights."

39:36.316 --> 39:38.983
"Even if you have to
steal my slumber away."

39:39.066 --> 39:41.733
"Hey O.."

39:41.816 --> 39:45.483
"Hey O..l am in love."

39:45.566 --> 39:49.816
"it's the intoxication
of first love."

39:49.899 --> 39:52.566
"Hey O.."

39:52.649 --> 39:55.691
"Hey O..l am in love."

39:55.774 --> 40:00.774
"it's the intoxication
of first love."

40:23.191 --> 40:27.399
"My breath is suddenly rising."

40:28.608 --> 40:32.483
"The eyes express.."

40:32.566 --> 40:34.191
That's right.

40:34.274 --> 40:36.941
"My breath is suddenly rising."

40:37.024 --> 40:39.649
"The eyes express.."

40:39.733 --> 40:44.399
"..your interest
in me is growing."

40:44.483 --> 40:49.899
"This feeling right now..
feels really great."

40:49.983 --> 40:53.858
"it's the intoxication
of first love."

40:53.983 --> 40:55.316
"Of first love."

40:55.399 --> 40:57.816
"it's a new experience."

40:58.149 --> 41:00.733
"My eyes convey.."

41:00.899 --> 41:03.483
"Come dwell in my sights."

41:03.566 --> 41:06.233
"Even if you have to
steal my slumber away."

41:06.316 --> 41:09.066
"Hey O.."

41:09.149 --> 41:12.024
"Hey O..l am in love."

41:12.108 --> 41:14.524
"it's the intoxication
of first love."

41:14.608 --> 41:17.191
"it's the intoxication
of first love."

41:17.274 --> 41:27.899
"Our eyes are meeting..
while sipping coffee."

41:28.149 --> 41:38.358
"Our eyes..are swaying
with the breeze of love."

41:40.858 --> 41:44.066
Do you know why you can't
walk straight after drinking?

41:45.066 --> 41:45.774
Why?

41:45.983 --> 41:47.024
Because the feet say..

41:47.441 --> 41:48.358
You picked up the
glass with your hand..

41:48.441 --> 41:50.108
...gulped it down the throat,
gave a hangover to your brain..

41:50.191 --> 41:50.858
...but you never asked us.

41:50.941 --> 41:51.733
We won't walk.

41:52.816 --> 41:53.983
You're crazy.

41:54.316 --> 41:55.733
Absolutely crazy.

41:56.983 --> 42:00.691
You know, you don't just
treat me to good liquor..

42:01.066 --> 42:03.649
...you're also a nice guy.

42:03.733 --> 42:05.649
We at the bottom always know..

42:05.733 --> 42:07.441
...how to grease
someone's palm, right?

42:08.066 --> 42:09.066
Yes.

42:09.483 --> 42:11.566
When the Collector died..

42:12.066 --> 42:14.108
...all the police officers
came to our office.

42:14.441 --> 42:16.108
I was right there.
- I know.

42:16.274 --> 42:17.774
But no one asked me anything.

42:17.858 --> 42:18.649
Nothing.

42:18.733 --> 42:20.566
Nonsense..

42:20.649 --> 42:25.649
Pappu..this is a list
of your office staff.

42:25.816 --> 42:29.483
Now tell me..
who scrapes the most icing.

42:29.566 --> 42:33.108
Like Vijay Mathur, Rakesh Kamble..
- This..

42:34.191 --> 42:35.899
Vijay Mathur.
- Vijay Mathur.

42:37.024 --> 42:38.524
He recently bought a big car.

42:38.608 --> 42:40.024
This big.
- I see.

42:40.108 --> 42:40.899
Yes.

42:43.274 --> 42:46.483
He gave 150 kilos of gold
in his daughter's marriage.

42:46.566 --> 42:47.566
150..

42:49.483 --> 42:52.191
This..this, this..this..
All of them.

42:52.566 --> 42:53.649
They are all corrupt.

42:53.983 --> 42:54.566
No..

42:54.649 --> 42:57.566
This..no.16.. Wasim..
- Wasim Sheikh.

42:57.691 --> 42:58.566
Wasim Sheikh.

42:58.899 --> 43:02.691
Honest.
- Really.

43:02.899 --> 43:04.316
But..

43:04.566 --> 43:07.233
This Wasim Sheikh,
he's a great guy.

43:08.024 --> 43:10.608
But you know,
he'll starve to death.

43:10.858 --> 43:12.524
Starve to death.
- Yeah, take it from me.

43:12.608 --> 43:13.899
He'll starve to death someday.

43:23.191 --> 43:24.524
Wasim Sheikh.

43:25.941 --> 43:29.608
Wasim Sheikh..honest officer.

43:29.983 --> 43:30.899
Nashik.

43:32.024 --> 43:33.983
Varsha Raje.

43:35.024 --> 43:36.358
Anuj More.

43:36.899 --> 43:38.191
Gobind Gawde.

43:39.524 --> 43:41.524
How did they form a team?

43:44.649 --> 43:45.816
Did you know that a man's brain..

43:45.899 --> 43:47.691
...is 10% bigger
than a woman's brain.

43:48.024 --> 43:48.649
Really?

43:48.733 --> 43:49.483
Excuse me.

43:49.774 --> 43:51.733
Hey..hello. Wait.

43:52.024 --> 43:55.733
But according to Google,
the female brain works faster.

43:56.858 --> 43:57.608
You and that Google.

43:57.691 --> 44:00.191
You know, there should be..

44:00.274 --> 44:01.399
...a Google temple right
beside Babulnath temple.

44:01.483 --> 44:02.149
Hail Google-nath!

44:02.233 --> 44:03.399
Hail Google-nath!
- Shut up.

44:03.483 --> 44:05.816
According to Google,
12% of road accidents..

44:05.899 --> 44:07.733
...occur because people
use their mobile phone..

44:16.774 --> 44:18.733
So many tests for a minor injury.

44:18.816 --> 44:20.316
Is it really necessary?

44:20.608 --> 44:22.024
Get these tests done..

44:22.191 --> 44:23.858
...otherwise you're
going to blame us.

44:24.191 --> 44:26.024
No, ma'am,
nobody is going to blame you.

44:26.566 --> 44:28.441
All I wanted to say was..

44:28.524 --> 44:29.941
...I was right there
when the accident happened.

44:30.024 --> 44:31.024
It was not a major accident.

44:31.108 --> 44:32.649
Then why did you come here?

44:32.899 --> 44:35.274
You could've
bandaged that at home.

44:35.858 --> 44:38.399
This is the problem
with educated people today.

44:38.566 --> 44:40.191
They think they're doctors.

44:42.358 --> 44:45.608
Doctor, they're insisting
on a normal delivery.

44:46.066 --> 44:48.899
You've been working
here for so many years..

44:48.983 --> 44:51.524
...but you still don't know
how to talk to the patients.

44:52.483 --> 44:55.858
Tell him caesarian
is absolutely safe.

44:55.941 --> 44:57.483
It's safe.

44:57.733 --> 44:59.733
But doctor,
they're willing to wait..

44:59.816 --> 45:01.983
...until it's
not a normal delivery.

45:02.774 --> 45:07.024
How will the hospital make
money if it's a normal delivery?

45:07.108 --> 45:08.774
And how will we pay your salary?

45:08.858 --> 45:10.399
Normal delivery is not possible.

45:10.483 --> 45:11.816
You must go for C-section.

45:12.483 --> 45:14.566
If they wait,
we will not be responsible.

45:14.649 --> 45:16.983
Tell them some big medical terms.

45:24.608 --> 45:27.441
Ma'am, you still have
to pay 70,000 rupees.

45:28.233 --> 45:30.524
But I paid 70,000 yesterday.
- Thank you.

45:31.441 --> 45:34.191
Look. - No, ma'am.
Actually, they were room charges.

45:34.274 --> 45:35.441
Give that to uncle.

45:38.608 --> 45:40.566
Let's go see mom, huh!

45:41.191 --> 45:42.149
Vivek, sir.

45:42.441 --> 45:43.441
601.

45:43.524 --> 45:45.316
Did he pay the bill?
- Yes, sir.

45:45.566 --> 45:46.483
Give him the slip.

45:49.774 --> 45:52.066
You can claim your wife's
body by showing this slip.

45:52.649 --> 45:53.524
Okay?

45:53.858 --> 45:55.858
Body? Why are you saying that?

45:56.108 --> 45:58.608
Your wife passed away last night.

45:59.816 --> 46:00.899
Passed away?

46:01.649 --> 46:02.524
When?

46:03.358 --> 46:05.816
I was right here
last night with my kid.

46:06.399 --> 46:07.733
Why didn't you tell me?

46:08.649 --> 46:11.608
She could've at least
seen her mother one last time.

46:13.024 --> 46:15.191
In the morning you
sent me to get money.

46:15.691 --> 46:16.441
And when I returned..

46:16.524 --> 46:18.024
...you made me stand
in the payment queue.

46:18.108 --> 46:19.566
You didn't tell me she's dead.

46:19.733 --> 46:22.608
Look, my job is to keep
an account of the money.

46:23.066 --> 46:24.191
Not the patient.

46:24.441 --> 46:25.941
And anyway,
we disclose this information..

46:26.024 --> 46:27.566
...after all the bills are settled.

46:27.649 --> 46:28.858
Otherwise,
people like you would leave..

46:28.941 --> 46:30.399
...without paying the Bills.

46:30.483 --> 46:32.108
What..

46:34.108 --> 46:35.816
She was dead last night.

46:36.441 --> 46:38.399
And they didn't
tell me she's dead.

46:39.608 --> 46:40.649
For the past one week..

46:40.733 --> 46:42.274
...I paid you every
penny you asked for.

46:42.983 --> 46:43.691
Here.

46:44.399 --> 46:45.399
Take some more.

46:45.608 --> 46:46.941
Take all of it.

46:48.316 --> 46:51.316
Can you let my child
see her mother one last time?

46:51.399 --> 46:53.274
Look, mister, this is a hospital.

46:53.358 --> 46:54.524
Please don't create a nuisance.

46:54.608 --> 46:55.733
Shut up!

46:58.691 --> 47:00.483
Those are the rules here.

47:00.691 --> 47:01.941
If you've got a problem..

47:02.024 --> 47:04.358
...then you can go to the
government hospital next door.

47:07.899 --> 47:10.274
Rs. 12,000.
I could've used this for shopping.

47:10.358 --> 47:12.024
I could've done many other things.

47:12.108 --> 47:13.483
Go ahead, I'll join you.

47:13.566 --> 47:15.316
Where are you going?
- There's something I need to do.

47:15.399 --> 47:16.358
Take madam to Versova.

47:16.441 --> 47:17.399
Go on.

47:22.483 --> 47:23.691
Balram Nagpal.

47:24.233 --> 47:25.774
You're his wife, aren't you?

47:25.858 --> 47:27.316
Sign here.

47:28.149 --> 47:29.233
Sign here, aunty.

47:29.316 --> 47:30.899
Only then will you
get his death certificate.

47:30.983 --> 47:32.024
Here.

47:33.191 --> 47:34.191
Fine.

47:34.441 --> 47:35.191
Give it.

47:35.441 --> 47:36.858
Give this at the cremation ground.

47:37.024 --> 47:38.191
Come on.

47:38.524 --> 47:41.066
He gambled away everything we had.

47:41.733 --> 47:45.066
How will I raise these two now?

47:45.524 --> 47:46.733
Oh Lord!

47:48.858 --> 47:50.024
Oh Lord!

47:51.649 --> 47:52.608
Oh Lord!

47:54.733 --> 47:57.483
The Lord doesn't
do everything Himself.

47:58.566 --> 48:01.608
He leaves some things
for devils like us.

48:08.941 --> 48:09.899
Doctor.

48:09.983 --> 48:12.191
Doctor. Please save him.

48:12.274 --> 48:13.483
He fell from the 3rd floor..

48:13.566 --> 48:14.316
...and he isn't
speaking since then.

48:14.399 --> 48:15.441
Please save him at any cost.

48:15.524 --> 48:16.983
Nurse, take him to
the emergency ward.

48:17.066 --> 48:18.316
And you,
first pay the admission fee. Quickly.

48:18.399 --> 48:19.441
Don't worry about the money.

48:19.524 --> 48:20.233
<i>I'll</i> pay everything.

48:20.316 --> 48:21.149
Just save him at any cost.

48:21.233 --> 48:22.733
Don't worry, relax.

48:25.941 --> 48:28.774
Did your husband
have insurance? - No.

48:29.024 --> 48:30.566
Come, let's get one now.

48:37.691 --> 48:38.983
He's dead.

48:39.816 --> 48:41.399
He's already dead, doctor.

48:45.566 --> 48:46.816
But they don't know this.

48:48.566 --> 48:51.733
He's alive until they
have money in their pockets.

48:51.816 --> 48:52.983
Here's the bill.

48:53.399 --> 48:55.441
What is the patient's name?
- Balram Nagpal.

48:55.774 --> 48:56.649
Start treatment.

48:56.858 --> 48:57.691
Begin.

49:00.441 --> 49:01.483
His condition's very serious.

49:01.566 --> 49:02.941
Get these medicines
and injections..

49:03.024 --> 49:04.774
...from the pharmacy immediately.

49:04.858 --> 49:05.858
Quick, quick, quick.
- Where's the pharmacy?

49:05.941 --> 49:06.733
On the right.

49:07.024 --> 49:09.358
Nurse, get me an oxygen
cylinder right now.

49:09.441 --> 49:10.691
7,300.

49:11.191 --> 49:12.566
Make the bill in the
patient's name. - Yes.

49:12.649 --> 49:14.483
Balram Nagpal.
- Okay.

49:17.941 --> 49:18.983
What took you so long?

49:19.066 --> 49:20.233
Don't you know it's an emergency?

49:20.316 --> 49:22.399
I didn't know my brother's
in such a serious condition.

49:22.483 --> 49:23.483
Can I see him?

49:23.566 --> 49:25.149
Please do not disturb
the doctor, okay.

49:25.233 --> 49:26.566
Go and sit there.

49:30.024 --> 49:31.566
Here, another lot.

49:31.899 --> 49:33.691
Go give it back to the chemist.

49:35.608 --> 49:37.024
Hey, take this.

49:37.316 --> 49:38.191
Maintain a proper record.

49:38.274 --> 49:40.483
You're always sore when
it comes to commissions.

49:42.816 --> 49:44.983
I never lie, dear.

49:46.774 --> 49:47.816
Excuse me.

49:48.274 --> 49:49.608
Please come.
- Yes.

49:51.316 --> 49:53.733
Look, his condition
is getting worse.

49:54.024 --> 49:54.941
It's a hemorrhage.

49:55.024 --> 49:57.233
I think we need to
call a neurosurgeon.

49:57.733 --> 50:00.233
You can call God if you want,
just make him better.

50:00.316 --> 50:01.524
Are you sure?
- Sure.

50:01.608 --> 50:03.024
His fee is 200,000!

50:03.316 --> 50:05.649
It's okay, I'll arrange for it.
- Okay.

50:05.733 --> 50:07.691
Nurse, call Dr. Verma.

50:08.399 --> 50:09.316
Okay.

50:13.066 --> 50:15.274
Make the bill in the name
of the patient, Balram Nagpal.

50:15.358 --> 50:16.274
Yes.

50:27.191 --> 50:28.274
Doctor..

50:30.233 --> 50:31.399
The Specialist is here.

50:31.483 --> 50:32.441
We'll save him.

50:32.899 --> 50:33.816
Yes.

50:37.733 --> 50:39.233
What kind of people are they?

50:40.858 --> 50:42.608
They don't even spare the dead.

50:43.483 --> 50:45.816
Just wait and
watch what they do next?

50:48.316 --> 50:50.608
You guys will get
me in trouble someday.

50:50.983 --> 50:52.858
This body is
starting to decompose.

50:53.066 --> 50:54.691
We can't keep up
this act for too long.

50:54.774 --> 50:57.483
Sir..when he's willing to pay..

50:57.566 --> 51:00.691
...we'll milk him all we can,
and take our share.

51:00.774 --> 51:03.483
Let's start with the
charade before it's too late.

51:26.983 --> 51:28.899
This act will end soon.

51:37.608 --> 51:39.358
Do you know how to
shoot a video with a phone?

51:39.441 --> 51:40.566
Yes.

51:43.233 --> 51:44.649
The doctor will
come out any moment.

51:44.983 --> 51:46.608
Focus only on him.

51:49.358 --> 51:51.191
He'll come out with a long face.

51:51.566 --> 51:55.358
He'll say "I'm sorry,
the patient is no more".

51:56.108 --> 51:58.316
"I wish you had
informed me earlier."

52:00.358 --> 52:02.441
Excuse me.
- Doctor.

52:02.524 --> 52:04.566
I am sorry,
the patient is no more.

52:05.149 --> 52:07.316
I wish you had
informed me earlier.

52:09.316 --> 52:10.941
Doctor, please try again.

52:11.024 --> 52:13.066
Try to understand, he's dead.

52:13.149 --> 52:14.566
Sir, you're a specialist.

52:14.774 --> 52:16.441
Please try once.

52:16.524 --> 52:17.899
What are you saying?

52:17.983 --> 52:19.108
How can he treat him?

52:19.191 --> 52:20.483
He's dead.

52:20.566 --> 52:22.483
Why? Can't the dead be treated?
- What?

52:22.941 --> 52:23.858
Obviously.

52:23.941 --> 52:25.649
How can anyone treat the dead?

52:25.733 --> 52:26.566
Why not?

52:26.649 --> 52:27.608
This is Patil Hospital.

52:27.691 --> 52:29.983
The dead can be treated here.
- Are you crazy?

52:30.066 --> 52:32.191
Who can treat the dead?
- Why not?

52:32.274 --> 52:32.983
Am I crazy?

52:33.066 --> 52:34.733
Look. Read this.

52:35.024 --> 52:36.274
What's written on it? Read it.

52:36.358 --> 52:37.691
Municipal Hospital?

52:38.191 --> 52:40.941
Dr. Deshmukh certifies
death at 11:25 am.

52:41.024 --> 52:44.274
Patient's name..Balram Nagpal.

52:45.566 --> 52:47.774
When the patient's already dead..

52:48.524 --> 52:52.524
...what were you all
doing in there for 6 hours?

52:54.608 --> 52:56.858
This isn't just the
patient's death certificate..

52:57.399 --> 52:59.774
...it's this hospital's
death certificate.

53:06.774 --> 53:09.941
You people are an expert
in conning the patients.

53:10.024 --> 53:12.233
Can I get a copy?

53:12.858 --> 53:14.358
How many do you want?

53:16.858 --> 53:19.024
What happened? Can't breathe?

53:19.274 --> 53:20.983
Should I call a specialist?

53:21.233 --> 53:22.483
This is your bill.

53:23.441 --> 53:25.858
Please pay 300,000
at the counter..

53:26.274 --> 53:27.358
...and collect the body.

53:28.566 --> 53:30.399
This body won't go anywhere.

53:30.608 --> 53:32.858
Until you don't make a
cheque for 500 million rupees..

53:33.191 --> 53:35.149
...in the name of Shanti Nagpal.

53:35.233 --> 53:35.899
What?

53:36.149 --> 53:37.983
Your game is up.

53:38.524 --> 53:39.899
Call your boss.

53:40.274 --> 53:41.149
Come on.

53:41.233 --> 53:42.233
Call your boss.

53:43.233 --> 53:44.691
Come on, out.

53:47.233 --> 53:48.399
Out!

53:49.483 --> 53:50.483
Out!

53:58.108 --> 53:59.066
Good shot.

53:59.649 --> 54:00.899
Buy him out!

54:01.899 --> 54:03.066
How much is he asking for?

54:04.066 --> 54:06.316
He's a little cynical, sir.

54:06.733 --> 54:07.899
No one knows him.

54:08.733 --> 54:10.191
All he keeps saying is..

54:10.649 --> 54:12.358
...I want to see your MD.

54:12.441 --> 54:14.066
I'll talk to him about the money.

54:23.066 --> 54:23.899
Hello.

54:23.983 --> 54:27.191
Dad, there's..a small problem.

54:27.649 --> 54:29.316
You expect me
to fly back from Dubai..

54:29.399 --> 54:30.566
...to solve your small problem?

54:30.941 --> 54:32.233
When will you ever grow up?

54:32.816 --> 54:35.024
It's your problem,
you deal with it.

54:39.983 --> 54:41.066
Call him.

54:48.316 --> 54:49.733
So you want 500 million rupees..

54:49.816 --> 54:51.024
...in exchange of all the evidence.

54:51.108 --> 54:54.483
Cheque for 500 million,
in the name of Shanti Nagpal.

54:54.566 --> 54:56.774
Wife of late Balram Nagpal.

54:56.858 --> 55:03.691
Rs. 4,60,475 which I spent, cash!

55:19.274 --> 55:22.108
Breaking your
pride is much more fun..

55:22.733 --> 55:25.108
...than breaking bones.

55:26.983 --> 55:29.483
Better pay up quietly--

55:30.316 --> 55:36.816
...otherwise I'll get
this place sealed up.

55:39.024 --> 55:41.233
Sir, this is a cheque
for 500 million..

55:41.316 --> 55:43.066
...and the rest of the cash.

55:48.649 --> 55:49.899
Here.

55:51.191 --> 55:53.024
Your husband's insurance cheque.

55:54.399 --> 55:58.066
I know this cannot
fill in the void.

55:58.483 --> 56:01.191
But it can make
life a little easier.

56:02.066 --> 56:03.108
Take it.

56:04.483 --> 56:05.816
Thank you.

56:06.774 --> 56:09.066
My husband's death did..

56:09.149 --> 56:11.399
...what he couldn't
do when he was alive.

56:21.816 --> 56:23.649
You are doctors.

56:25.191 --> 56:29.566
It's your duty to serve people,
not con them.

56:30.066 --> 56:31.441
Shame on you all.

56:32.066 --> 56:33.191
I am sorry.

56:35.899 --> 56:37.858
I just hate sorry's.

56:57.191 --> 57:01.316
Shut it down!
- Shut down Patil Hospital!

57:01.399 --> 57:04.941
Shut it down!
- Shut down Patil Hospital!

57:09.274 --> 57:11.066
Sir, that guy double-crossed us.

57:11.149 --> 57:12.358
He took money from us..

57:12.441 --> 57:14.191
...and also gave the
evidence to the media.

57:16.774 --> 57:18.983
Move away. You idiots.

57:20.191 --> 57:21.899
How the hell can
they enter my property?

57:22.399 --> 57:23.566
I won't spare them.

57:25.274 --> 57:26.316
Sir..sir..

57:30.816 --> 57:32.358
Get out from my property.

57:33.399 --> 57:34.274
Move.

57:34.899 --> 57:36.024
Just back off!

58:04.024 --> 58:06.566
Let's go home boss.

58:07.149 --> 58:07.983
Boss, the body..

58:08.066 --> 58:10.066
I mean Vikas
has been brought home.

58:10.649 --> 58:11.774
Let's go home.

58:11.858 --> 58:13.024
Please.
- Shut up.

58:15.024 --> 58:16.691
You do know who I am.

58:17.108 --> 58:18.066
Patil.

58:18.483 --> 58:20.316
Digvijay Patil.

58:21.024 --> 58:22.649
I am a brand!

58:23.649 --> 58:25.316
I am a bloody brand!

58:26.858 --> 58:28.566
First he killed my son..

58:28.858 --> 58:32.816
...and also
challenged my reputation.

58:33.608 --> 58:35.191
I want him.

58:36.066 --> 58:38.191
I will first kill him..

58:39.066 --> 58:42.899
...and then cremate my son's body.

58:42.983 --> 58:46.024
Sir, many have seen his face.

58:46.483 --> 58:48.524
But no one knows
anything about him.

58:49.024 --> 58:51.858
So he just came and left
after ruining everything.

58:51.941 --> 58:53.399
And you don't know anything.

58:53.483 --> 58:56.524
And that woman,
who he gave the 500 million..

58:56.608 --> 58:57.983
...doesn't know him either.

58:58.274 --> 58:59.441
She was saying that..

58:59.524 --> 59:01.191
...she met her at
the Municipal hospital.

59:01.399 --> 59:05.358
Sir..he must be on the
hospital's CCTV camera.

59:12.233 --> 59:14.233
What's the
connection between them?

59:14.899 --> 59:17.274
Relatives..
- What, sir?

59:18.316 --> 59:20.733
You see, whenever I
need some expert advice..

59:20.816 --> 59:22.399
...I talk to myself.

59:27.399 --> 59:29.483
What's up, guys?
- How are you all?

59:29.691 --> 59:30.816
Good! Good! Good!

59:31.774 --> 59:34.149
Are you all going
for the college reunion?

59:34.233 --> 59:34.899
Yes.

59:34.983 --> 59:36.524
We're all meeting after three years.

59:36.858 --> 59:39.108
Everyone is busy with their jobs.
We hardly see each other. - Wait.

59:39.733 --> 59:40.524
Yes.

59:40.608 --> 59:43.274
Anuj More. Wasim Sheikh..

59:43.524 --> 59:45.108
No one's going to
miss the college reunion.

59:45.191 --> 59:46.441
College connection.

59:50.399 --> 59:52.774
There are 48 cameras
in 16 blocks of the hospital.

59:52.983 --> 59:54.316
I'm checking the
tapes of all the blocks.

59:54.399 --> 59:55.483
Hurry UP-

59:58.774 --> 01:00:00.399
If my superiors find out..

01:00:00.483 --> 01:00:02.274
...I've been looking through personal
files of government officers..

01:00:02.358 --> 01:00:03.566
...then I will
definitely lose my job.

01:00:03.774 --> 01:00:05.233
But I will get promoted.

01:00:06.066 --> 01:00:07.399
Thank you.

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:09.983
Check which college
they all studied at?

01:00:10.066 --> 01:00:11.358
Arjun More, Sanghli.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.066
Wasim Sheikh, Nashik.

01:00:13.691 --> 01:00:15.233
Varsha Raje, Latur.

01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:16.733
Milind Sangvi, Dhule.

01:00:19.066 --> 01:00:22.191
Sir, he paid 4,60,000
at the cash counter.

01:00:22.816 --> 01:00:23.691
What time?

01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:25.024
At around 11:30am.

01:00:25.108 --> 01:00:26.399
So why are you
showing us all this.

01:00:26.483 --> 01:00:28.941
Play the tape from 11 am, quickly.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:31.191
Find out the
connection between them.

01:00:31.274 --> 01:00:33.274
Arun More, AV college..

01:00:33.608 --> 01:00:35.441
Wasim Sheikh, MG college.

01:00:35.524 --> 01:00:37.691
Varsha Raje, Garge college.

01:00:37.899 --> 01:00:39.941
Milind Sangvi, Hindu college.

01:00:40.024 --> 01:00:41.524
They are all
from different fields.

01:00:41.608 --> 01:00:43.483
What could be the common
connection between them?

01:00:43.691 --> 01:00:45.233
This is their post-graduation.

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:47.149
Search from where they
did their graduation.

01:00:47.233 --> 01:00:48.691
You will get me into trouble..

01:00:48.774 --> 01:00:50.441
Forget the job, come on.

01:00:57.399 --> 01:00:58.524
Fast-forward.

01:00:59.483 --> 01:01:00.399
Yes.

01:01:00.483 --> 01:01:01.649
That's the man, sir.

01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:07.608
Rewind!

01:01:10.399 --> 01:01:11.524
National College.

01:01:11.608 --> 01:01:12.691
National College.

01:01:12.774 --> 01:01:13.858
National College.

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:14.941
National College.

01:01:15.233 --> 01:01:17.941
They all did their graduation
from National College.

01:01:20.149 --> 01:01:22.608
All these honest people..

01:01:22.691 --> 01:01:24.358
...have branched
out from this tree.

01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:30.316
And the root of this
tree.. that Gabbar.

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.816
Is from this National College.

01:01:37.899 --> 01:01:39.066
Zoom.

01:01:40.483 --> 01:01:41.858
Zoom in.

01:01:42.858 --> 01:01:44.274
Stop!

01:01:50.816 --> 01:01:52.358
This isn't possible.

01:01:52.858 --> 01:01:57.399
I killed this man five
years ago with my own hands.

01:02:06.191 --> 01:02:08.191
Hey Sadhu, buddy.

01:02:08.274 --> 01:02:10.566
Welcome back..
- $0..

01:02:10.649 --> 01:02:12.649
You know, since the day you left..

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:15.608
...I had to put up with all
that fritter and red sauce crap.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.524
You don't know.

01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:19.149
He'll soon apprehend Gabbar.

01:02:19.233 --> 01:02:20.316
He's got a solid lead.

01:02:20.399 --> 01:02:21.983
Congratulations.

01:02:22.149 --> 01:02:23.441
If I get another week's leave..

01:02:23.524 --> 01:02:24.899
...I'll bring Gabbar
back on this scooter.

01:02:26.608 --> 01:02:28.983
Look, I've thought of
a great plan to catch Gabbar.

01:02:30.149 --> 01:02:31.983
There's a honest officer
in every office..

01:02:32.066 --> 01:02:33.108
...who gives information to Gabbar.

01:02:33.191 --> 01:02:34.399
Right?

01:02:35.566 --> 01:02:36.191
What..

01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:39.024
Look..the senior's junior is the
most brain at work.

01:02:39.608 --> 01:02:40.649
We're already across interval..

01:02:40.733 --> 01:02:41.941
...and they are still stuck here.

01:02:42.858 --> 01:02:44.858
They won't be able to figure
it out even after the interval.

01:02:45.233 --> 01:02:47.441
And all the areas in between..

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:52.733
Welcome, Sadhu.

01:02:52.816 --> 01:02:55.691
Your presence has sanctified
our Police Station.

01:02:55.774 --> 01:02:57.399
Long time no see.

01:02:57.483 --> 01:02:58.191
How are you?

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.483
Sir, I was on a leave for few days.

01:03:00.983 --> 01:03:02.399
Did you go to the mountains?

01:03:02.649 --> 01:03:03.899
If you have finished meditating..

01:03:03.983 --> 01:03:05.233
...can we get some work done here?

01:03:05.316 --> 01:03:07.066
Sir, I need another five days leave.

01:03:08.066 --> 01:03:12.316
Thakur, Gabbar has been
sc***ing our department..

01:03:12.608 --> 01:03:15.566
...and Sadhu here needs another leave.

01:03:16.233 --> 01:03:18.149
Are you in your senses?

01:03:18.233 --> 01:03:20.566
Sir, I need leave to catch, Gabbar.
- Shut up!

01:03:20.649 --> 01:03:23.483
Have you lost your mind?

01:03:23.774 --> 01:03:26.399
You're still hung
over playing James Bond.

01:03:26.774 --> 01:03:29.899
You mean you did
what we all couldn't do.

01:03:30.066 --> 01:03:31.024
You caught Gabbar.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.066
I haven't yet, sir.

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:33.316
But I am very close.

01:03:33.399 --> 01:03:34.566
Hey..smarty..

01:03:35.066 --> 01:03:37.524
You like playing catch, don't you?

01:03:38.024 --> 01:03:40.399
My wife's dog has been
missing for three days.

01:03:41.149 --> 01:03:42.816
Go catch the dog and bring him back.

01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:45.399
Believe me, sir, I am very close.

01:03:45.941 --> 01:03:47.733
You're testing our patience.

01:03:48.399 --> 01:03:50.441
I'll transfer you to a place..

01:03:50.524 --> 01:03:53.108
...where you won't
survive a single day.

01:03:53.316 --> 01:03:54.149
Out!

01:03:54.233 --> 01:03:55.733
Last time, sir.

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:58.816
Out means get out!

01:04:00.733 --> 01:04:01.774
Yes, Yadav..

01:04:02.483 --> 01:04:04.108
And Sadhu..
- I know, sir.

01:04:04.524 --> 01:04:05.983
Fritters and red sauce.

01:04:06.858 --> 01:04:07.816
Smart boy!

01:04:09.983 --> 01:04:12.191
You will definitely win
today's fancy dress competition.

01:04:12.274 --> 01:04:13.649
It's a Maharashtrian wedding.

01:04:13.733 --> 01:04:15.441
Veena and Mark, inter-caste marriage.

01:04:15.524 --> 01:04:16.816
Did you know that
according to Google..

01:04:16.899 --> 01:04:18.691
...16% of the marriages
in India are inter-caste.

01:04:18.774 --> 01:04:19.774
You're absolutely right.

01:04:19.858 --> 01:04:21.816
Your marriage with Google
was inter-caste as well. - Adi.

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:23.108
Okay.

01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:25.691
Boss, there are 8
million voters in Mumbai.

01:04:25.983 --> 01:04:28.441
But Aditya's photo
doesn't match with anyone.

01:04:29.108 --> 01:04:30.858
I don't care.

01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:32.858
I want him.

01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:35.024
Even my mom and dad
had an inter-caste marriage.

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.441
And their product is me, Shruti.

01:04:39.524 --> 01:04:40.774
And did you know that..

01:04:47.816 --> 01:04:49.149
Sorry.

01:04:56.483 --> 01:04:58.024
Taxi.

01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:01.191
The venue's been decorated
so beautifully, right?

01:05:01.274 --> 01:05:02.941
Yes. Just like when
we were getting married.

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.399
Here, 300 rupees.

01:05:04.608 --> 01:05:06.566
If I am late today,
Veena's going to kill me.

01:05:06.649 --> 01:05:09.149
Listen, madam. Take your change.

01:05:09.733 --> 01:05:14.066
Wow! Since when did Mumbai's
Taxi drivers give change?

01:05:14.149 --> 01:05:15.941
Since we don't have
any extra expenses.

01:05:16.566 --> 01:05:18.983
No RTO guy imposes penalty.

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:20.858
Nor does any constable ask for bribe.

01:05:20.941 --> 01:05:23.899
We don't have to pay for
renewing our permit either.

01:05:23.983 --> 01:05:26.774
Corruption is dead thanks to Gabbar.

01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:28.399
No corruption means..

01:05:28.483 --> 01:05:29.983
...our hard-earned money is enough.

01:05:30.899 --> 01:05:32.524
Keep it.

01:05:32.774 --> 01:05:33.941
Thank you, sir.

01:05:36.108 --> 01:05:37.441
This is phenomenal.

01:05:37.524 --> 01:05:38.816
I think I am in love with Gabbar.

01:05:38.899 --> 01:05:40.649
Gabbar is a criminal.
- Shut up.

01:05:40.733 --> 01:05:41.441
Sorry.

01:05:41.524 --> 01:05:42.483
Hi!
- Sorry.

01:06:44.399 --> 01:06:49.941
"Keep dwelling in me."

01:06:52.983 --> 01:06:58.149
"Make your presence
felt in every breath."

01:07:00.024 --> 01:07:04.358
"From dusk to
dawn..you're only for me."

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:08.399
"Without you..I've nothing."

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:13.358
"We're separate but our soul's one."

01:07:13.649 --> 01:07:16.899
"Don't ever leave me and go away."

01:07:16.983 --> 01:07:24.649
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

01:07:25.691 --> 01:07:34.399
"Let our story..pour down like love."

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:42.649
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

01:07:43.149 --> 01:07:51.691
"Let our story..pour down like love."

01:08:00.233 --> 01:08:01.733
'Long live..'

01:08:11.816 --> 01:08:20.399
"Look at the blessings
conferred on us."

01:08:20.483 --> 01:08:28.899
"We've found refuge in each other."

01:08:29.274 --> 01:08:37.566
"We've all the..necessities to live."

01:08:38.816 --> 01:08:46.899
"May everything..stay the way it is."

01:08:46.983 --> 01:08:50.941
"From dusk to
dawn..you're only for me."

01:08:51.358 --> 01:08:55.274
"Without you..I've nothing."

01:08:55.608 --> 01:09:00.274
"We're separate but
our souls are one."

01:09:00.566 --> 01:09:03.816
"Don't ever leave me and go away."

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:11.691
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

01:09:12.608 --> 01:09:20.816
"Let our story..pour down like love."

01:09:23.691 --> 01:09:27.816
"Keep dwelling in me."

01:09:32.233 --> 01:09:37.774
"Make your presence
felt in every breath."

01:09:58.733 --> 01:10:06.774
"The only thing that
happened between us."

01:10:07.274 --> 01:10:15.399
"it was love, love and only love."

01:10:15.899 --> 01:10:25.399
"We're so close,
there's nothing missing."

01:10:25.983 --> 01:10:33.608
"May we live together..as
long as we live."

01:10:33.858 --> 01:10:37.774
"From dusk to
dawn..you're only for me."

01:10:38.274 --> 01:10:42.274
"Without you..I've nothing."

01:10:42.608 --> 01:10:46.566
"We're separate but our soul's one."

01:10:47.441 --> 01:10:50.649
"Don't ever leave me and go away."

01:10:50.816 --> 01:10:58.691
"Our story..is like
the drops of rain."

01:10:59.566 --> 01:11:07.691
"Let our story..pour down like love."

01:11:47.316 --> 01:11:50.358
Someone please save me.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:52.483
Do something quickly.

01:12:18.524 --> 01:12:20.399
Adi.

01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:25.149
Adi.

01:12:30.816 --> 01:12:34.858
When old liquor and old
memories get to your mind..

01:12:35.733 --> 01:12:38.316
...it makes a man out of control.

01:12:38.399 --> 01:12:40.983
But who is this guy who's
getting so out of control?

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:42.858
What enmity does he have with you?

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:45.899
Even if the fire's extinguished..

01:12:45.983 --> 01:12:50.983
...there's a spark left somewhere..

01:12:51.858 --> 01:12:53.983
...which can turn into flames anytime.

01:12:56.566 --> 01:12:59.108
Remember our Andheri Building case.

01:12:59.399 --> 01:12:59.983
Which one?

01:13:00.066 --> 01:13:01.441
The one that collapsed five years ago?

01:13:02.399 --> 01:13:03.733
Yes, that one.

01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:08.774
His family was amongst
the people that died.

01:13:09.358 --> 01:13:13.399
Some people get.. too
serious about their family.

01:13:14.649 --> 01:13:16.191
Sir, 212 people died..

01:13:16.274 --> 01:13:19.316
...because of your building
that collapsed in Andheri.

01:13:19.608 --> 01:13:21.983
And more than 100 people
are in the hospital.

01:13:22.066 --> 01:13:24.483
And sir,
there was a creek at first.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.774
On your advice, the Corporation
filled up the creek..

01:13:25.858 --> 01:13:27.691
...and also passed the
registration of that land.

01:13:27.774 --> 01:13:29.399
After conducting the soil test..

01:13:29.483 --> 01:13:32.566
...we knew that a building that
high won't stand there for too long.

01:13:32.649 --> 01:13:36.691
But on your advice,
we declared it as dry soil.

01:13:39.233 --> 01:13:41.608
Did you call me here
to tell me all this?

01:13:42.941 --> 01:13:44.608
But sir, someone has
to take responsibility..

01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:46.733
...for the inquiry
which has been ordered.

01:13:46.983 --> 01:13:49.358
We bribed everyone to keep quiet.

01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:52.191
But I wonder where did
this man get all the evidence?

01:13:52.399 --> 01:13:55.191
Who is that man? Call him.

01:13:55.816 --> 01:13:57.649
Sir, he's a little cynical.

01:13:57.899 --> 01:14:00.191
His wife was crushed under
the debris of the building.

01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:02.066
Sir, his wife was pregnant too.

01:14:02.483 --> 01:14:03.899
Sir, I'll take care of
all the legal formalities..

01:14:03.983 --> 01:14:05.774
What's his name?
- Aditya.

01:14:12.733 --> 01:14:14.108
So, Aditya.

01:14:14.524 --> 01:14:15.858
I heard you've been
wielding that file..

01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:17.316
...as a weapon against me.

01:14:17.483 --> 01:14:19.399
Is that right?

01:14:22.441 --> 01:14:25.899
Hey Collector..how much
did you get to pass the tender?

01:14:25.983 --> 01:14:27.566
Sir..
- Say it.

01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:29.566
This is not a sting operation.

01:14:29.649 --> 01:14:31.858
Sir..18 million.

01:14:32.649 --> 01:14:35.399
See..9 is his lucky number.

01:14:35.941 --> 01:14:37.816
And he takes only on a Tuesday.

01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:40.649
Hey..how much did you
take for the registration?

01:14:40.941 --> 01:14:42.108
<i>8</i> million.

01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:45.108
How much did I
pay for that soil test?

01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:47.274
Sir..3.5 million.

01:14:48.816 --> 01:14:51.649
You think they will
lay a finger on me.

01:14:51.941 --> 01:14:55.108
Look, this inquiry isn't
going to help you in anyway.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:15:01.108
The level we're at, we only
hear requests from the common man.

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:04.608
Not their voices.

01:15:05.191 --> 01:15:07.233
What's done is done.

01:15:07.774 --> 01:15:09.024
There's nothing
we can do about it.

01:15:10.733 --> 01:15:12.524
Fine, I apologize.

01:15:12.816 --> 01:15:14.066
Forgive us.

01:15:14.399 --> 01:15:16.233
Collector, say sorry.

01:15:17.399 --> 01:15:18.233
Sorry.

01:15:18.441 --> 01:15:19.608
Not like that.

01:15:20.441 --> 01:15:23.524
Hold your ears
and say it properly.

01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:26.774
Sorry, sir.
- That's better.

01:15:27.358 --> 01:15:31.608
We're saying sorry and
you're still staring at us.

01:15:35.024 --> 01:15:37.858
They all work for me, understand.

01:15:38.691 --> 01:15:41.024
You can never harm me.

01:15:42.524 --> 01:15:44.399
Digvijay Patil.

01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:47.983
This isn't just a name,
it's a Brand.

01:15:48.066 --> 01:15:49.399
Brand!

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.608
Let's do one thing.

01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:59.024
I'll give you two chances.

01:15:59.941 --> 01:16:04.399
You can call anyone
in Maharashtra you like.

01:16:04.483 --> 01:16:05.649
Go ahead and complain.

01:16:06.483 --> 01:16:07.608
Do it.

01:16:09.983 --> 01:16:11.274
Do it.

01:16:11.941 --> 01:16:13.191
Don't be scared.

01:16:15.941 --> 01:16:17.566
Do you have a phone,
or should I give you mine?

01:16:26.566 --> 01:16:27.274
Hello.

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:28.483
Hello.

01:16:28.774 --> 01:16:30.316
Is this Commissioner's office?
- Yes.

01:16:30.399 --> 01:16:32.399
Can I talk to the Commissioner?
- Yes.

01:16:32.483 --> 01:16:32.858
One second please?

01:16:32.941 --> 01:16:34.691
Is the Commissioner on the line?

01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:38.399
Sir, the building which
collapsed in Andheri..

01:16:38.483 --> 01:16:41.316
...killing 200 people..was
Digvijay Patil's doing.

01:16:41.399 --> 01:16:42.566
Wrong number!

01:16:47.899 --> 01:16:49.733
Call again. Do it.

01:16:53.316 --> 01:16:54.399
Home Secretary.

01:16:57.024 --> 01:16:57.524
Hello.

01:16:57.608 --> 01:16:58.774
Hello, Mr. Pankaj Tiwari.

01:16:58.983 --> 01:16:59.691
Yes.

01:16:59.774 --> 01:17:01.566
Sir, the building which
collapsed in Mumbai..

01:17:01.649 --> 01:17:03.358
...was Digvijay Patil's fault.

01:17:03.566 --> 01:17:04.816
I have all the
evidence and files..

01:17:04.899 --> 01:17:06.358
My number isn't public number.

01:17:06.608 --> 01:17:07.649
Everyone calls me.

01:17:07.733 --> 01:17:09.066
Change my number now.

01:17:10.191 --> 01:17:12.358
All lines in this route are busy.

01:17:12.733 --> 01:17:14.608
Please check the
number you've dialed.

01:17:14.983 --> 01:17:16.816
This number does not exist.

01:17:21.358 --> 01:17:22.691
That's normal.

01:17:23.608 --> 01:17:25.524
I bribed everyone.

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:29.566
Don't worry, I'll pay you too.

01:17:29.816 --> 01:17:32.108
Look, the Government is giving..

01:17:32.316 --> 01:17:34.816
...2.5 million to all those
who died in that incident.

01:17:35.858 --> 01:17:37.608
You'll get 2.5 million too.

01:17:37.899 --> 01:17:39.483
But actually you should
be getting 5 million.

01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:42.899
The Collector told me
everything about your wife.

01:17:43.399 --> 01:17:46.024
So that 2.5 for
the kid too, right?

01:17:46.733 --> 01:17:48.733
Forget the Government.

01:17:49.233 --> 01:17:51.649
I'll give you 10 million.

01:17:51.983 --> 01:17:52.983
Happy?

01:17:53.608 --> 01:17:55.024
Take the money.

01:17:55.274 --> 01:17:57.608
Get married again. Get a new wife.

01:17:57.858 --> 01:17:59.024
You're still young.

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:00.608
So you can have kids again.

01:18:00.774 --> 01:18:02.524
Start a new life.

01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:05.108
Have fun.

01:18:06.108 --> 01:18:08.191
There's no point
in doing all this.

01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:22.108
Take your money.

01:18:46.024 --> 01:18:47.149
Open the door.

01:19:54.233 --> 01:19:56.649
I beg you. Spare my life.

01:19:56.941 --> 01:19:59.108
Sorry! Sorry!

01:19:59.399 --> 01:20:00.524
Spare my life.

01:20:00.608 --> 01:20:02.899
I beg you. Please.

01:20:36.983 --> 01:20:41.274
I like those who don't like me.

01:20:42.441 --> 01:20:44.649
Such people have courage.

01:20:46.191 --> 01:20:47.608
Ballu.
- Yes.

01:20:48.066 --> 01:20:52.649
Find out all the Aditya
that were ever born in India.

01:20:52.733 --> 01:20:53.608
Yes. Alright.

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.816
Breaking News!

01:20:56.899 --> 01:20:58.149
BMC attacked by Gabbar!

01:20:58.233 --> 01:20:59.733
Corrupt BMC officer hung to death.

01:21:00.983 --> 01:21:02.858
Hanging of IT officer creates havoc.

01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:05.566
Police to pay Gabbar's tax.

01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:08.399
This is Vijay Sabnis.

01:21:08.483 --> 01:21:10.608
There's a lot
of property in his name.

01:21:10.774 --> 01:21:11.733
Ten in the name of his father.

01:21:11.816 --> 01:21:12.649
Five in the name of his uncle.

01:21:12.733 --> 01:21:13.899
And 15 in the name of Tipsy.

01:21:14.274 --> 01:21:15.024
Who is Tipsy?

01:21:15.108 --> 01:21:18.024
Wife?
- Tipsy is his seven year old dog.

01:21:18.316 --> 01:21:20.649
I'm sure she eats
gold biscuits, sir.

01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:22.191
What has the world come to, sir?

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:23.774
People are doing illegal things..

01:21:23.858 --> 01:21:25.233
...in the name of
the most loyal animal.

01:21:25.316 --> 01:21:26.941
Anil..
- Yes, sir.

01:21:27.399 --> 01:21:29.649
Slide up his
name from no.6 to no.3.

01:21:29.733 --> 01:21:30.316
Yes, sir.

01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:32.983
Sir, he's got a bungalow
near Pune worth 80 million.

01:21:33.191 --> 01:21:33.983
In the name of Tipsy.

01:21:34.191 --> 01:21:35.899
Slide him to no.2.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:37.983
Sir.

01:21:38.483 --> 01:21:39.149
Sir.

01:21:39.233 --> 01:21:40.274
Just got the news, sir.

01:21:40.358 --> 01:21:43.066
A CBI officer has been appointed
by the Centre to apprehend Gabbar.

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:45.274
Kuldeep Pawa.

01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:46.608
Very powerful.

01:21:47.274 --> 01:21:48.483
Gabbar!

01:21:49.399 --> 01:21:50.524
Question mark!

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:52.399
Who is this Gabbar?

01:21:54.858 --> 01:21:56.983
He kidnapped a Collector
in broad daylight.

01:21:57.608 --> 01:21:59.274
He killed him and hung him!

01:21:59.774 --> 01:22:00.733
And then what?

01:22:00.899 --> 01:22:03.441
A District Collector! BMC Officer!

01:22:03.524 --> 01:22:04.983
Income-Tax officer!

01:22:06.233 --> 01:22:07.358
So many Government officers..

01:22:07.441 --> 01:22:08.899
...were killed in broad daylight.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.024
Months passed away, and..

01:22:12.941 --> 01:22:15.649
I don't have any reason
to understand this.

01:22:15.899 --> 01:22:16.816
Sir!

01:22:17.233 --> 01:22:18.691
Sir, we tried hard.

01:22:18.899 --> 01:22:20.316
Gabbar is very smart.

01:22:20.524 --> 01:22:21.608
His network..
- What's your name?

01:22:21.816 --> 01:22:23.066
Sir?
- Your name.

01:22:23.274 --> 01:22:26.274
Vishwas Sawant.
- Mr. Sawant can you hear yourself?

01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:28.941
I mean can you
really hear yourself.

01:22:29.774 --> 01:22:32.233
Because for me, it sounds
like a common man's cribbing..

01:22:32.316 --> 01:22:33.524
...not a Police man's statement.

01:22:34.524 --> 01:22:35.608
Sorry, sir.

01:22:36.024 --> 01:22:38.733
You get promotion and
medals only by working hard..

01:22:38.983 --> 01:22:40.399
...not by saying sorry.

01:22:43.108 --> 01:22:45.483
Sir, I need every single
information about this guy.

01:22:47.399 --> 01:22:49.441
Every single detail we have.

01:22:49.524 --> 01:22:52.024
I need every data we have..

01:22:52.108 --> 01:22:53.524
...from a peon to officers.

01:22:53.608 --> 01:22:54.566
Right now.
- Sir.

01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:55.608
That's it.

01:22:58.566 --> 01:22:59.691
What?

01:23:01.649 --> 01:23:04.108
I am back! Missed me?

01:23:04.566 --> 01:23:07.399
When 100 people get together
and ruin your life..

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.649
...that's called marriage.

01:23:08.733 --> 01:23:12.358
But when 10 million people
together ruin a country..

01:23:12.608 --> 01:23:14.274
...that's a corrupt Government.

01:23:14.524 --> 01:23:14.983
Absolutely right.

01:23:15.066 --> 01:23:20.066
All the poor get is
rebukes and stones. - Right.

01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:23.649
The currency notes only have
Gandhiji's face, not his stick.

01:23:23.858 --> 01:23:25.774
That's why some people are spoilt.

01:23:26.274 --> 01:23:28.649
The list is ready.

01:23:28.899 --> 01:23:32.733
Let's see whose stars
fall in a quandary this Friday.

01:23:34.441 --> 01:23:35.733
Now, sir.

01:23:36.274 --> 01:23:38.649
How do we find a clue from a CD?

01:23:39.316 --> 01:23:41.483
He openly threatened us.

01:23:42.066 --> 01:23:43.899
How do we arrest a voice, sir?

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:45.733
We don't have
enough Police force..

01:23:46.358 --> 01:23:48.399
...compared to the corrupt
people in this city.

01:23:48.733 --> 01:23:50.274
And we don't
know which department..

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:51.816
...he will target this time.

01:23:56.066 --> 01:23:58.816
Sir, Gabbar's CD has
terrorized the entire state.

01:23:58.899 --> 01:24:00.274
What is the Police doing about it?

01:24:00.358 --> 01:24:02.608
I want to assure
everyone through you..

01:24:02.691 --> 01:24:04.566
...that the safety of the
entire state is our responsibility.

01:24:04.649 --> 01:24:05.274
So don't worry.

01:24:05.524 --> 01:24:06.233
Next.

01:24:06.566 --> 01:24:08.149
Gabbar has struck twice.

01:24:08.233 --> 01:24:09.858
But the Police
haven't done anything.

01:24:10.066 --> 01:24:12.941
Look, no one has
to panic or be scared.

01:24:13.024 --> 01:24:14.566
He's taking his glasses
off and wearing it back.

01:24:15.566 --> 01:24:17.233
They're reacting
when it's time for action.

01:24:18.566 --> 01:24:22.816
And especially from a
criminal that hides in shadows.

01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:24.899
He doesn't have the
courage to show himself!

01:24:26.399 --> 01:24:27.524
So relax, okay.

01:24:27.608 --> 01:24:28.816
We have everything under control.

01:24:28.899 --> 01:24:31.483
One question please.
- Listen sir.

01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:34.983
I want to assure you that..

01:24:35.066 --> 01:24:37.316
...the Police knows
how to do their duty.

01:24:37.399 --> 01:24:38.441
And we are doing it.

01:24:43.274 --> 01:24:44.566
Yes.
- Our department, sir.

01:24:44.649 --> 01:24:45.858
We just received news that..

01:24:45.941 --> 01:24:47.441
<i>"Gabbar has abducted
Pune's ACP Shushâ Shinde.</i>

01:24:47.524 --> 01:24:47.983
What?

01:24:48.066 --> 01:24:49.566
Bring sir back to the
Police Station immediately.

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:51.399
Many Gabbars came and went.

01:24:51.483 --> 01:24:52.566
Sir.
- What?

01:24:52.649 --> 01:24:54.983
Sir, Gabbar is abducting
police officers.

01:24:55.066 --> 01:24:55.733
What?

01:24:55.941 --> 01:24:57.983
Sir, we've received
orders to bring you back..

01:24:58.066 --> 01:24:59.774
...to the Police Station
immediately for your own safety.

01:25:01.608 --> 01:25:04.733
Sir, now who will protect you?

01:25:05.024 --> 01:25:06.358
Please come, sir.

01:25:07.108 --> 01:25:11.066
Everyone's requested,
to please help the police..

01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:13.108
...so we can help you in return.

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:14.566
Please pay attention.

01:25:17.483 --> 01:25:19.899
Hey..why isn't this working?

01:25:21.108 --> 01:25:22.358
You're on the top 10 list.

01:25:23.733 --> 01:25:26.024
Sir, Vasai's ACP More's
been kidnapped too.

01:25:26.108 --> 01:25:26.691
Shit.

01:25:26.774 --> 01:25:28.774
Sir, Nagpur.
Tawde has been kidnapped.

01:25:29.566 --> 01:25:32.274
That means..7 wickets down.

01:25:32.358 --> 01:25:33.358
Are you playing cricket here?

01:25:33.441 --> 01:25:35.316
Sir..
- He's bowling and we're batting.

01:25:35.941 --> 01:25:36.899
Idiot!

01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:45.524
Sir, three people are still left.

01:25:46.316 --> 01:25:47.733
We're in a race against him.

01:25:50.066 --> 01:25:51.941
Who's the most
corrupt Police officer?

01:25:53.858 --> 01:25:55.316
I know everybody knows.

01:25:56.899 --> 01:25:58.691
Tell me so I can save him.

01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:01.733
Say it.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.524
Gawre sir.
- Who?

01:26:06.024 --> 01:26:07.233
Chandrakant Gawre.

01:26:07.441 --> 01:26:08.608
Yes, it'll be done.

01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:11.358
Tell Jadhav I'm calling.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:11.441 --> 01:26:12.358
Go on.
- Chandrakant Gawre come in.

01:26:12.441 --> 01:26:13.441
Hey you..
- Yes sir.

01:26:13.524 --> 01:26:15.024
See that betel-leaf guy there.
- Yes.

01:26:15.358 --> 01:26:16.858
Tell him to give my betel-leaf.
- Yes.

01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:17.649
Come in. Come in.

01:26:17.733 --> 01:26:19.274
Chandrakant Gawre here.
- Listen Chandrakant Gawre

01:26:19.358 --> 01:26:21.566
You could be the next target.
Be alert.

01:26:23.608 --> 01:26:25.733
I am Chandrakant Gawre, sir!

01:26:26.691 --> 01:26:29.524
Death will have to come
down personally to kill me.

01:26:31.733 --> 01:26:33.316
Chandrakant, be alert.

01:26:33.399 --> 01:26:35.024
I am getting backup force for you.

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:37.399
Stay alert.

01:26:37.483 --> 01:26:38.649
Do you copy, Chandrakant?

01:26:39.066 --> 01:26:40.316
You don't worry.

01:26:40.691 --> 01:26:42.066
Copy!Copy!

01:27:13.399 --> 01:27:14.191
Don't waste my time.

01:27:14.274 --> 01:27:16.108
Just get here, come on.

01:27:19.441 --> 01:27:20.399
What's wrong?

01:27:20.483 --> 01:27:21.983
Get lost, come on.

01:27:23.649 --> 01:27:25.649
Sir, Chandrakant sir
has been kidnapped. - What?

01:27:28.233 --> 01:27:29.358
Alert all check posts.

01:27:29.441 --> 01:27:30.358
Put up check posts everywhere.

01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:31.524
Every station.

01:27:31.608 --> 01:27:32.941
Don't let even
a single car through.

01:27:33.024 --> 01:27:34.149
Search every car.

01:27:34.233 --> 01:27:35.149
Search every guy.

01:27:35.233 --> 01:27:36.649
Orders for every check post.

01:27:36.733 --> 01:27:38.233
Orders are from Kuldeep sir..

01:27:38.774 --> 01:27:39.608
What in there?

01:27:40.483 --> 01:27:41.483
Grandpa, sir.

01:27:41.733 --> 01:27:42.483
Open it up.

01:27:53.399 --> 01:27:55.899
Hey..stop that black car.

01:27:55.983 --> 01:27:57.441
Don't let it through
without checking.

01:27:57.524 --> 01:27:58.483
Stop him.

01:27:58.566 --> 01:28:00.399
What's going on here?
- We're checking sir.

01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:01.816
You mean you haven't checked yet.

01:28:01.899 --> 01:28:02.524
I am doing it, sir.

01:28:02.608 --> 01:28:05.233
You know he's kidnapped
an officer from our department.

01:28:05.316 --> 01:28:06.691
He could be in that too.

01:28:06.774 --> 01:28:07.608
What's in there?

01:28:07.691 --> 01:28:09.066
Mother? Father?
- Grandpa.

01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:10.441
Grandpa? So why are you crying?

01:28:10.524 --> 01:28:12.024
It was his time to go.
- Yes.

01:28:12.108 --> 01:28:14.358
Why are you being so emotional?

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:19.233
How long has he been dead?
- Two days.

01:28:19.316 --> 01:28:21.108
Two days? And you're still
carrying the body around.

01:28:21.524 --> 01:28:22.816
Let it through.

01:28:23.358 --> 01:28:26.358
Come on, look there.

01:28:26.566 --> 01:28:30.274
And I want the report
in every ten minutes. Come on.

01:28:48.983 --> 01:28:52.441
You fool..you don't
know who you've abducted!

01:28:52.524 --> 01:28:54.691
I am Chandrakant Gawre!

01:28:54.941 --> 01:28:57.274
Police officer Chandrakant Gawre!

01:28:57.358 --> 01:28:59.441
Let me go.

01:28:59.524 --> 01:29:01.399
You will have to pay a big price.

01:29:04.316 --> 01:29:05.316
Yes, Govind.

01:29:05.483 --> 01:29:06.816
Let me go!
- Where are you?

01:29:06.899 --> 01:29:07.899
Okay.

01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:11.399
Let me go.

01:29:12.191 --> 01:29:13.566
Leave me!

01:29:14.066 --> 01:29:15.024
Hold on.

01:29:15.108 --> 01:29:17.441
When will Govind get here?
- He's on his way.

01:29:18.733 --> 01:29:20.608
What will you get by killing me?

01:29:20.983 --> 01:29:22.816
What will you get by killing me?

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:26.399
You've kidnapped a Police officer.

01:29:30.399 --> 01:29:31.733
After I kill you..

01:29:31.816 --> 01:29:33.649
...your entire department
will be purified.

01:29:34.899 --> 01:29:36.858
It's a proud moment for you.

01:29:37.066 --> 01:29:39.066
And for me, this is enough.

01:29:41.399 --> 01:29:42.483
Who are you?

01:29:42.858 --> 01:29:45.608
Ravi, take him inside.

01:29:45.899 --> 01:29:46.899
Come on.

01:29:47.316 --> 01:29:51.566
Come on.
- You will pay for this.

01:29:51.774 --> 01:29:53.608
You will pay for this.

01:29:57.941 --> 01:30:01.399
Adi.. you kidnapped
a police officer.

01:30:01.483 --> 01:30:02.899
What the hell are you doing?

01:30:03.274 --> 01:30:04.733
Kidnapping! Murder!

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:06.774
What are you doing, Adi?

01:30:07.191 --> 01:30:08.441
Who are you?

01:30:10.274 --> 01:30:11.399
Gabbar!

01:30:12.733 --> 01:30:14.983
Gabbar? You..

01:30:17.608 --> 01:30:20.066
Oh, my God.. How?

01:30:22.608 --> 01:30:28.941
"I didn't see, or think
just lost my heart to you."

01:30:32.191 --> 01:30:34.024
Hey guys come here.

01:30:38.691 --> 01:30:40.774
Take him inside.

01:30:42.899 --> 01:30:44.566
Clean the blood.
- Yes.

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:48.358
Please do this.

01:30:49.399 --> 01:30:53.774
Those who saved my life, I thought
I should do something for them.

01:30:53.983 --> 01:30:55.691
The youth has a simple strategy.

01:30:55.774 --> 01:30:57.233
If you like it, then welcome..

01:30:57.358 --> 01:30:58.816
...if you don't, then don't come.

01:30:58.899 --> 01:31:00.774
Patriotism boils in our blood.

01:31:01.108 --> 01:31:03.941
But only for IPL,
ISL and Kabbir Leagues.

01:31:04.024 --> 01:31:06.858
Reality shows get more
votes than in elections.

01:31:06.941 --> 01:31:07.733
Why?

01:31:07.816 --> 01:31:09.608
Swami Vivekananda had said..

01:31:09.691 --> 01:31:11.858
"Give me 100 young
men of heart and energy.."

01:31:11.941 --> 01:31:13.983
"..and I shall revolutionize
the entire country."

01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:15.899
I brought this
thought into action.

01:31:16.316 --> 01:31:18.233
After talking to them I realized..

01:31:18.316 --> 01:31:19.899
Some have courage, but no power.

01:31:19.983 --> 01:31:21.441
Some have power, but no courage.

01:31:21.524 --> 01:31:23.774
And if they have both,
there's corruption.

01:31:24.108 --> 01:31:25.941
The entire system
has become a quagmire.

01:31:26.024 --> 01:31:28.483
Everyone knows that
the situation is sad.

01:31:28.566 --> 01:31:31.899
Corruption is slowly turning into
an addiction like anti-depressant.

01:31:31.983 --> 01:31:33.483
And then..slow death.

01:31:33.566 --> 01:31:34.816
We all decided.

01:31:34.899 --> 01:31:37.733
There's no point organizing
candle rallies later.

01:31:37.941 --> 01:31:40.899
Right now..we'll have
to ignite a fire in our heart.

01:31:41.191 --> 01:31:43.316
We taught good manners to animals.

01:31:43.524 --> 01:31:45.858
It's time to teach
humanity to humans.

01:31:46.024 --> 01:31:47.691
Slowly we grew.

01:31:47.774 --> 01:31:49.108
Our team was ready.

01:31:49.316 --> 01:31:50.774
Just one goal.

01:31:50.858 --> 01:31:52.483
To spread the terror
of Gabbar to an extent..

01:31:52.566 --> 01:31:54.691
...where these
government officers..

01:31:54.774 --> 01:31:56.983
...will think twice even
before taking their salary.

01:31:58.608 --> 01:32:01.899
I am the thread which we needed..

01:32:02.941 --> 01:32:04.108
...to bring these pearls together.

01:32:04.441 --> 01:32:05.566
Gabbar!

01:32:07.108 --> 01:32:09.191
Sir..Govind!

01:32:13.108 --> 01:32:15.191
Sir, we've done it.

01:32:15.441 --> 01:32:17.524
On Facebook,
Twitter, News Channels..

01:32:17.608 --> 01:32:21.483
The biggest villain has
turned into the biggest hero.

01:32:21.899 --> 01:32:23.816
Gabbar is trending. No.1.

01:32:24.108 --> 01:32:25.566
The entire world
is talking about him.

01:32:25.774 --> 01:32:26.983
And everyone wants to know.

01:32:27.274 --> 01:32:29.108
Everyone has the same question.

01:32:29.566 --> 01:32:30.733
Who is Gabbar?

01:32:31.274 --> 01:32:32.649
Isn't that great news?

01:32:33.566 --> 01:32:34.483
What happened?

01:32:34.566 --> 01:32:35.608
Isn't that great news?

01:32:35.899 --> 01:32:37.399
Why isn't anyone reacting?

01:32:38.983 --> 01:32:40.108
Govind.

01:32:41.483 --> 01:32:43.983
The list that we made
for corrupt Police officers..

01:32:45.566 --> 01:32:49.566
...had your father's name on top.

01:32:57.233 --> 01:32:58.399
What do we do?

01:32:59.149 --> 01:33:00.233
What else, sir?

01:33:01.066 --> 01:33:03.899
Collector. District Collector.

01:33:05.733 --> 01:33:07.066
They had kids too, sir.

01:33:08.274 --> 01:33:11.691
One only sees their crimes,
not their kin.

01:33:15.274 --> 01:33:16.983
Not Twitter or Facebook.

01:33:17.691 --> 01:33:21.983
You made me realize that
my mission is a success.

01:33:23.316 --> 01:33:24.358
Sir.

01:33:24.816 --> 01:33:26.149
When people stand up..

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.358
...against the crimes
committed by their own kin..

01:33:28.816 --> 01:33:31.108
...then people like
Gabbar are not required.

01:33:32.358 --> 01:33:35.941
This is the idea
I wanted to get through.

01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:37.649
And I have succeeded.

01:33:39.691 --> 01:33:40.566
Good.

01:33:40.649 --> 01:33:41.524
But, sir..

01:33:43.649 --> 01:33:45.066
Is my father here?

01:33:50.483 --> 01:33:51.983
I can't see him suffer.

01:33:53.899 --> 01:33:55.274
He might be bad..

01:33:58.316 --> 01:33:59.774
...but I am his good son.

01:34:02.899 --> 01:34:04.024
Am I, Adi sir?

01:34:10.191 --> 01:34:11.941
Gabbar! Gabbar! Gabbar!

01:34:13.108 --> 01:34:14.774
That's all
everyone's talking about.

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.066
And his voice!

01:34:18.024 --> 01:34:19.066
Every time I try to sleep..

01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:20.899
...his voice echoes in my ears.

01:34:22.191 --> 01:34:24.233
I want to know, am I the
only one spending sleepless nights..

01:34:24.316 --> 01:34:26.108
...or does anyone here
share the same empathy?

01:34:27.483 --> 01:34:28.608
Anyone.

01:34:34.233 --> 01:34:35.566
Sir, we're fighting this battle..

01:34:35.649 --> 01:34:37.566
...with only a scabbard,
not a sword.

01:34:37.649 --> 01:34:38.733
Hey..shut up!

01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:40.233
Ignore him, sir.

01:34:40.733 --> 01:34:42.191
He's our local James Bond.

01:34:42.524 --> 01:34:47.066
Son..everyone loves his
smartness and a better job.

01:34:47.274 --> 01:34:48.733
Mind your business.

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:49.941
That's not all, sir.

01:34:50.024 --> 01:34:51.024
You should hear
the main highlight.

01:34:51.108 --> 01:34:53.274
He thinks he
has almost found Gabbar.

01:34:53.691 --> 01:34:55.274
And soon he'll catch him.

01:35:01.483 --> 01:35:03.399
Sir, you will never
be able to catch Gabbar now.

01:35:03.483 --> 01:35:05.358
Hey smarty..shut up.

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:08.191
Or else I'll fire you.
- Get lost.

01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:11.774
Fire me? I'll resign myself.

01:35:11.858 --> 01:35:12.899
I resign.

01:35:13.066 --> 01:35:14.399
I don't want
to work in an office..

01:35:14.483 --> 01:35:15.774
...that's filled with
arrogant officers like you.

01:35:15.858 --> 01:35:17.066
Sadhu..

01:35:17.483 --> 01:35:18.483
What, Sadhu?

01:35:18.774 --> 01:35:21.566
Sir, they think someone
will serve them Gabbar on a plate.

01:35:22.274 --> 01:35:24.358
Gabbar is not an
ordinary kidnapper, sir.

01:35:25.108 --> 01:35:26.399
He's on a mission.

01:35:27.399 --> 01:35:28.941
He's a mission himself.

01:35:29.024 --> 01:35:31.024
Don't forget you're a constable..
- Shut up!

01:35:39.566 --> 01:35:42.149
What else do you know about him?

01:35:43.899 --> 01:35:44.983
Look here, sir.

01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:48.066
A list of Nanded's
Collector office.

01:36:18.858 --> 01:36:20.524
Excellent job, Sadhu.

01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:23.358
You've solved
90% of the case.

01:36:24.441 --> 01:36:26.191
By why didn't you
tell anyone until now?

01:36:28.608 --> 01:36:30.191
Sir, I am just a driver.

01:36:42.899 --> 01:36:44.691
Then let's go for a drive, Sadhu.

01:36:56.566 --> 01:37:01.233
Sir, neither Police nor goons
are allowed inside this gate.

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:03.983
That's the rule of
our National College.

01:37:04.649 --> 01:37:05.983
Is this some kind of a joke?

01:37:06.316 --> 01:37:08.108
Couldn't you vacate the
college before I got here?

01:37:08.524 --> 01:37:09.983
Stop staring at me, get them out.

01:37:10.066 --> 01:37:11.983
Sir. Let it be.

01:37:12.066 --> 01:37:13.316
It will turn into
a big student issue.

01:37:13.524 --> 01:37:16.274
The principal,
teachers, students are crazy.

01:37:21.566 --> 01:37:24.399
Okay, we can't go in.

01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:26.733
But we can arrest
those who are outside.

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:28.441
Yes.

01:37:28.524 --> 01:37:29.649
Get your list.

01:37:30.441 --> 01:37:31.858
Arrest everyone.

01:37:32.358 --> 01:37:33.358
Yes, sir.

01:37:38.566 --> 01:37:39.941
Come here.

01:37:40.024 --> 01:37:42.149
What are you doing sir?
- Come with us.

01:37:42.233 --> 01:37:43.274
Catch him.

01:37:43.358 --> 01:37:44.774
What are you doing? Leave me.
- Come with us.

01:37:46.483 --> 01:37:48.566
Come with us.

01:37:48.899 --> 01:37:52.524
Sit in the car quietly.

01:38:09.983 --> 01:38:14.108
Now Patil's projects seem
illegal because of Gabbar's terror.

01:38:14.608 --> 01:38:16.899
The entire real estate
lobby is worried.

01:38:17.274 --> 01:38:18.858
Because of you all.

01:38:23.983 --> 01:38:27.649
If you like Gabbar's style,
then so be it.

01:38:28.274 --> 01:38:30.274
Gabbar abducted
10 corrupt officers..

01:38:30.358 --> 01:38:32.233
...to get his message through.

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:35.649
I abducted 10 honest officers.

01:38:37.983 --> 01:38:41.233
Which amongst you is
the most honest officer?

01:38:45.608 --> 01:38:46.524
Come on.

01:38:48.358 --> 01:38:51.024
What is your name?
-Sagar Pandit.

01:38:51.691 --> 01:38:53.108
Sagar Pandit.

01:38:55.733 --> 01:38:57.483
Are you abstinent against money?

01:38:58.524 --> 01:39:00.149
Doesn't your wife make demands?

01:39:00.566 --> 01:39:02.983
"I want this..l want that."

01:39:04.274 --> 01:39:06.108
Would you like a
medal for your honesty?

01:39:17.899 --> 01:39:20.358
If you're of no use to me..

01:39:20.441 --> 01:39:22.941
...you're no good
to this world either.

01:39:26.483 --> 01:39:30.608
If you accept bribe,
Gabbar will kill you.

01:39:30.941 --> 01:39:32.524
And if you don't..

01:39:33.733 --> 01:39:36.066
Great, officers.

01:39:36.483 --> 01:39:41.274
Now I don't even need to
pay you for getting my job done.

01:39:41.524 --> 01:39:45.399
Just a little
dose of fear is enough.

01:39:45.983 --> 01:39:47.566
We've been beating
these guys since morning..

01:39:47.649 --> 01:39:49.316
...yet no one's ready to speak up.

01:39:49.399 --> 01:39:51.274
What am I going to
tell the Home Ministry?

01:39:54.733 --> 01:39:56.191
Does anyone have an idea?

01:39:56.274 --> 01:39:57.733
How do we catch this Gabbar?

01:39:58.649 --> 01:39:59.774
Anything?

01:40:00.233 --> 01:40:01.983
Sawant? Bansal?

01:40:03.233 --> 01:40:04.274
Sir, may I?

01:40:07.608 --> 01:40:10.108
To catch Gabbar,
we'll have to think like him.

01:40:12.066 --> 01:40:12.858
Sit.

01:40:13.274 --> 01:40:14.274
Yadav, shift.

01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:17.899
I said sit. Sit.

01:40:17.983 --> 01:40:19.024
Yes, sir.

01:40:21.608 --> 01:40:23.274
Yadav, order tea for everyone.

01:40:24.483 --> 01:40:25.941
Would you like one?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:26.024 --> 01:40:27.024
Him too.

01:40:27.274 --> 01:40:28.608
What were you saying?

01:40:30.483 --> 01:40:31.316
Sir..

01:40:32.316 --> 01:40:33.941
...if I was Gabbar..

01:40:34.941 --> 01:40:37.066
...I would've gone
after Digvijay Patil.

01:40:37.858 --> 01:40:38.608
Why?

01:40:39.274 --> 01:40:42.608
Two days ago he killed
an honest officer Sagar Pandit..

01:40:42.774 --> 01:40:44.899
...because he
refused to take bribe.

01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:48.483
But we don't have any proof.

01:40:48.733 --> 01:40:50.899
But, sir, everyone knows
he's the one who did it.

01:40:50.983 --> 01:40:52.024
Right, sir.

01:40:52.566 --> 01:40:55.441
Digvijay Patil wants to maintain
his fear amongst the people.

01:40:55.733 --> 01:40:59.399
But Gabbar will
definitely punish him.

01:41:11.941 --> 01:41:13.899
We set out to
eradicate bad people..

01:41:14.274 --> 01:41:16.024
...but evil just a bigger leap.

01:41:16.524 --> 01:41:18.899
<i>Sagan" was one of the
most honest officers...</i>

01:41:19.108 --> 01:41:20.358
...in his department, sir.

01:41:20.816 --> 01:41:23.274
Patil killed him very cruelly.

01:41:26.274 --> 01:41:30.191
Sir, should we arrest Digvijay
Patil or give him protection?

01:41:33.191 --> 01:41:34.983
There's a thumb rule of hunting.

01:41:36.108 --> 01:41:37.483
Use the goat as bait..

01:41:37.566 --> 01:41:38.983
...as long as the
lion doesn't come out.

01:41:42.983 --> 01:41:45.191
We just need to keep an eye on Patil.

01:41:46.399 --> 01:41:47.941
And Gabbar will
be in our clutches.

01:41:50.483 --> 01:41:52.191
Patil has to die.

01:41:52.524 --> 01:41:53.733
The party's at his farm house..

01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:55.941
...and security is really tight.

01:41:56.899 --> 01:41:59.816
Sir, we have Digvijay
Patil's schedule.

01:42:00.316 --> 01:42:01.608
Tomorrow is his birthday.

01:42:01.691 --> 01:42:03.608
It's not that easy
to catch Patil, sir.

01:42:03.691 --> 01:42:05.899
Most of our team members
are in police custody.

01:42:06.358 --> 01:42:08.358
That place will be crawling
with his men and Police.

01:42:08.441 --> 01:42:11.608
Ministers,
MPs, MLAs, Businessmen..

01:42:11.983 --> 01:42:13.483
...and other famous personalities
will be present there.

01:42:13.816 --> 01:42:15.858
But we'll be waiting
for just one man.

01:42:17.858 --> 01:42:18.691
Gabbar!

01:42:20.566 --> 01:42:21.441
Boss.

01:42:22.483 --> 01:42:23.983
We've the whereabouts..

01:42:24.066 --> 01:42:25.399
...of that rascal Aditya
from the hospital.

01:42:26.399 --> 01:42:28.191
I'll bring you his severed head..

01:42:28.274 --> 01:42:30.191
...before you
cut your birthday cake.

01:42:33.274 --> 01:42:37.066
Ballu,
please bring him back alive.

01:42:38.441 --> 01:42:40.274
I will kill him myself.

01:42:40.691 --> 01:42:41.983
I will kill him again!

01:42:45.274 --> 01:42:47.108
"Come, sweetheart."

01:42:49.649 --> 01:42:50.608
"Come, sweetheart."

01:42:50.691 --> 01:42:53.566
"I don't know what you want."

01:42:53.941 --> 01:42:54.941
"Come, sweetheart."

01:42:55.024 --> 01:42:57.899
"Why do you make
gestures and call me?"

01:42:58.233 --> 01:42:59.108
"Come, sweetheart."

01:42:59.191 --> 01:43:01.941
"Then why do you refuse
when I come home."

01:43:02.608 --> 01:43:03.316
"Come, sweetheart."

01:43:03.399 --> 01:43:07.358
"Why do you climb
up the roof and sing?"

01:43:07.983 --> 01:43:10.108
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

01:43:10.191 --> 01:43:12.649
"Just come in, sweetheart."

01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:18.733
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

01:43:18.816 --> 01:43:20.858
"Just come in, sweetheart."

01:43:20.941 --> 01:43:23.024
"Lay those flowers,
sprinkle that perfume.."

01:43:23.108 --> 01:43:25.191
"..and get in the mood now,
sweetheart."

01:43:25.274 --> 01:43:27.358
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

01:43:27.441 --> 01:43:29.608
"Just come in, sweetheart."

01:43:33.649 --> 01:43:37.524
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:43:37.983 --> 01:43:42.274
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:43:43.774 --> 01:43:49.983
"Slowly.."

01:44:08.483 --> 01:44:09.816
"I'm your sweetheart,
be my love."

01:44:09.899 --> 01:44:10.524
Hello.

01:44:10.608 --> 01:44:12.233
"Tonight I am going
to rock your world."

01:44:12.316 --> 01:44:13.858
I've heard a lot about you.

01:44:14.108 --> 01:44:15.274
I hope you won't disappoint me.

01:44:17.274 --> 01:44:19.274
"I'm going to forsake all shame."

01:44:19.358 --> 01:44:21.441
"And make you my queen."

01:44:21.524 --> 01:44:25.816
"Tonight we're going to have
some fun, baby..under the dim light."

01:44:27.483 --> 01:44:30.066
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:44:31.274 --> 01:44:33.691
Boss. We're at Aditya's home.

01:44:36.191 --> 01:44:40.108
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:44:40.358 --> 01:44:42.858
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:44:50.316 --> 01:44:52.399
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

01:44:52.483 --> 01:44:54.608
"Just come in, sweetheart."

01:44:54.691 --> 01:44:56.733
"Lay those flowers,
sprinkle that perfume.."

01:44:56.816 --> 01:44:59.024
"..and get in the mood now,
sweetheart."

01:44:59.108 --> 01:45:01.024
"Don't knock on the door,
sweetheart."

01:45:01.108 --> 01:45:03.274
"Just come in, sweetheart."

01:45:07.316 --> 01:45:11.566
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:45:11.649 --> 01:45:17.358
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:45:17.441 --> 01:45:19.399
"Slowly, sweetheart."

01:45:19.483 --> 01:45:23.733
"Slowly.."

01:45:47.899 --> 01:45:49.691
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:45:49.774 --> 01:45:51.691
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:45:51.774 --> 01:45:53.649
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:45:53.733 --> 01:45:55.483
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:45:55.566 --> 01:45:57.399
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:45:57.483 --> 01:45:59.274

Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:01.233 --> 01:46:03.024

01:46:03.108 --> 01:46:04.858
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:06.691
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:46:06.774 --> 01:46:08.441
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:08.524 --> 01:46:10.274
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:46:10.358 --> 01:46:12.149
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:12.233 --> 01:46:14.149
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:46:14.233 --> 01:46:15.899
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:15.983 --> 01:46:17.774

Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:27.024 --> 01:46:28.649
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:46:28.733 --> 01:46:30.524
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:30.941 --> 01:46:32.191
There he is.

01:46:33.024 --> 01:46:33.858
Catch him.

01:46:33.941 --> 01:46:35.316
I am coming down.

01:46:35.399 --> 01:46:37.108
Okay, sir. Copy. Copy.

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:38.858
Catch him!

01:46:39.983 --> 01:46:41.149
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:46:41.233 --> 01:46:43.108
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky.

01:46:43.191 --> 01:46:44.858

Until the moon and

01:46:46.608 --> 01:46:48.233
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:46:48.316 --> 01:46:50.274
Until the moon and

01:46:50.358 --> 01:46:51.441
...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:46:51.524 --> 01:46:53.399
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:53.483 --> 01:46:55.524
...Patil you won't be remembered.

01:46:55.608 --> 01:46:57.483
Until the moon and
the sun shines in the sky..

01:46:57.566 --> 01:46:59.191

...Patil sir will be remembered.

01:47:35.191 --> 01:47:36.608
Check posts have been
setup for many hours..

01:47:36.691 --> 01:47:39.274
...but there's still no news.

01:47:39.566 --> 01:47:42.108
What could be the reason
behind Digvijay Patil's kidnapping?

01:47:42.191 --> 01:47:43.274
You can clearly see here..

01:47:43.358 --> 01:47:44.483
...how the entire police
force is trying hard..

01:47:44.566 --> 01:47:46.191
...to catch Digvijay Patil.

01:47:52.524 --> 01:47:53.649
Shame on us.

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:55.608
He kidnapped
right before our eyes.

01:47:56.066 --> 01:47:57.024
Sawant.
- Sir.

01:47:57.108 --> 01:47:58.983
Someone must know his hideout.

01:47:59.441 --> 01:48:00.274
Find out.
- Yes sir.

01:48:00.358 --> 01:48:01.441
Sir.
- What?

01:48:03.399 --> 01:48:04.274
What?

01:48:04.358 --> 01:48:07.524
I am the council representing the
arrested Government officer. - So.

01:48:07.608 --> 01:48:09.858
We have permission
to meet our client.

01:48:10.566 --> 01:48:12.649
And their relatives
are with us too.

01:48:13.691 --> 01:48:15.274
Sir, I've checked all the papers.

01:48:15.358 --> 01:48:16.691
Can we go see them now?

01:48:19.608 --> 01:48:20.733
Where is my son?

01:48:20.816 --> 01:48:21.941
Deepak.

01:48:22.524 --> 01:48:23.691
Deepak.

01:48:23.774 --> 01:48:25.233
Deepak.

01:48:27.691 --> 01:48:28.941
Oh, God!

01:48:29.024 --> 01:48:31.233
They beat him up so brutally.

01:48:32.274 --> 01:48:33.399
Well done, sir.

01:48:35.274 --> 01:48:38.691
You've done a great job by
arresting these innocent people.

01:48:39.024 --> 01:48:40.233
What?

01:48:40.483 --> 01:48:41.566
Innocent?

01:48:42.191 --> 01:48:44.274
Innocent? My foot.

01:48:45.316 --> 01:48:46.983
All of them are serial offenders.

01:48:48.899 --> 01:48:50.441
They've committed murders
along with Gabbar.

01:48:50.524 --> 01:48:51.649
All of them.

01:48:53.024 --> 01:48:54.358
Innocent

01:48:55.399 --> 01:48:58.024
And I know..Gabbar
has kept Digvijay Patil..

01:48:58.108 --> 01:48:59.483
...and he's going to kill him.

01:49:01.316 --> 01:49:02.691
Bloody criminals.

01:49:03.274 --> 01:49:04.441
Govind.

01:49:05.983 --> 01:49:09.649
Sir..ACP Chandrakant's wife.

01:49:16.899 --> 01:49:18.483
Mother.

01:49:26.108 --> 01:49:27.941
Gabbar killed your husband, ma'am.

01:49:28.983 --> 01:49:30.149
He killed your husband.

01:49:30.233 --> 01:49:31.149
His father.

01:49:32.066 --> 01:49:34.524
Tell him to tell us
where he could be hiding.

01:49:34.774 --> 01:49:36.233
Where are his hideouts?

01:49:37.316 --> 01:49:38.316
You will be responsible..

01:49:38.399 --> 01:49:41.774
...for your husband
and his father's death.

01:49:43.233 --> 01:49:48.233
Govind,
if you tell them anything..

01:49:49.524 --> 01:49:52.316
...then consider
your mother's dead!

01:49:52.649 --> 01:49:53.858
Ma'am.

01:49:54.858 --> 01:49:59.441
You're a Policeman's
wife supporting a criminal.

01:50:12.358 --> 01:50:13.816
I don't get this.

01:50:14.566 --> 01:50:15.524
Why?

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:17.316
Who is this Gabbar?

01:50:19.274 --> 01:50:21.608
Why is a criminal getting
so much affection?

01:50:22.024 --> 01:50:24.691
Because the Law isn't
doing its job properly.

01:50:25.441 --> 01:50:26.524
Sorry!

01:50:27.608 --> 01:50:30.983
The Police needs to arrest
the corrupt government officials..

01:50:31.066 --> 01:50:33.399
...and then the court
needs to punish them.

01:50:33.483 --> 01:50:35.149
If the Law is helpless..

01:50:35.233 --> 01:50:37.149
...then somebody
has to do something!

01:50:39.191 --> 01:50:41.399
So you think Gabbar
is legally correct.

01:50:41.483 --> 01:50:43.566
Sir, the society doesn't suffer..

01:50:43.649 --> 01:50:45.066
...because of the
criminals wrong-doings.

01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:49.191
A society suffers when
a capable man does nothing.

01:50:49.566 --> 01:50:51.149
Gabbar is a good man.

01:50:51.858 --> 01:50:54.274
Gabbar is capable of
doing something for us.

01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:57.066
You know him, don't you?

01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:59.399
You know who he is.

01:51:00.108 --> 01:51:01.649
I know the reason..

01:51:02.066 --> 01:51:04.399
...which turned a
common man into Gabbar.

01:51:07.649 --> 01:51:08.941
When you light a torch..

01:51:09.024 --> 01:51:13.983
...where's the one place
that still stays dark?

01:51:16.691 --> 01:51:18.524
Stupid, right under the torch.

01:51:19.399 --> 01:51:20.941
The police is
running helter-skelter..

01:51:21.024 --> 01:51:22.899
...but no one's
looking in your home.

01:51:24.316 --> 01:51:26.108
You want revenge from me?

01:51:27.191 --> 01:51:29.024
I am Digvijay Patil.

01:51:29.691 --> 01:51:30.899
I am a bloody brand.

01:51:30.983 --> 01:51:33.399
What's this about brand
you keep ranting about!

01:51:33.733 --> 01:51:35.483
Take a good look at me.

01:51:35.858 --> 01:51:40.316
Digvijay Patil,
lam a bigger brand than you.

01:51:40.858 --> 01:51:41.941
You?

01:51:42.441 --> 01:51:43.649
Yes, me.

01:51:44.358 --> 01:51:46.274
Even 50 miles away..

01:51:46.358 --> 01:51:48.233
...when someone takes
a bribe people say..

01:51:48.316 --> 01:51:49.566
"Don't take it, or..

01:51:50.566 --> 01:51:52.358
...Gabbar will show up."

01:51:54.066 --> 01:51:55.358
You are Gabbar?

01:51:56.233 --> 01:51:57.483
Yes.

01:51:58.524 --> 01:52:00.024
Gabbar!

01:52:05.483 --> 01:52:10.108
Five years ago you
gave me two chances.

01:52:11.358 --> 01:52:14.858
Today I'll give you three.

01:52:16.441 --> 01:52:18.149
You can call anyone you want.

01:52:19.483 --> 01:52:22.774
And tell them who you are.

01:52:23.191 --> 01:52:28.649
You will know who's
a bigger brand, you or me.

01:52:28.899 --> 01:52:30.108
Make the call.

01:52:39.983 --> 01:52:41.233
Hello.
- Hello.

01:52:41.816 --> 01:52:43.566
Waghmare.
- Speaking.

01:52:44.108 --> 01:52:45.441
This is Digvijay Patil.

01:52:46.274 --> 01:52:47.899
I am in trouble, Waghmare.

01:52:49.066 --> 01:52:50.441
Gabbar has kidnapped me.

01:52:50.524 --> 01:52:52.608
Why are you dragging
me in this mess?

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:56.024
If Gabbar finds out,
I'll be sc***d.

01:52:56.316 --> 01:52:57.316
Hang UP-

01:52:57.399 --> 01:52:58.816
I made you Home Minister.

01:52:58.899 --> 01:53:00.316
I'll pay you any price you want.

01:53:00.483 --> 01:53:01.566
My life is in danger.

01:53:01.733 --> 01:53:02.816
Hello! Hello!

01:53:08.399 --> 01:53:09.983
Second chance.

01:53:18.941 --> 01:53:19.441
Hello.

01:53:19.524 --> 01:53:20.733
Commissioner's office.

01:53:20.816 --> 01:53:22.149
This is Digvijay Patil.

01:53:22.441 --> 01:53:24.733
Gabbar is holding me captive.

01:53:24.941 --> 01:53:26.108
Is this the Police Station?

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:27.566
No.

01:53:27.774 --> 01:53:28.858
This is the Police Station.

01:53:28.941 --> 01:53:29.941
That's what I am saying.

01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:31.024
This is the Police Station, right?

01:53:31.108 --> 01:53:32.024
That's what I am saying.

01:53:32.108 --> 01:53:33.816
This is the Police Station,
not the Pizza Station.

01:53:34.441 --> 01:53:35.941
Sadhu, what's wrong?

01:53:36.608 --> 01:53:37.816
It's some crazy guy, sir.

01:53:37.899 --> 01:53:39.691
He's called up the Police
Station and ordering for pizza.

01:53:41.774 --> 01:53:44.233
For the last time..this
is the Police Station.

01:53:45.941 --> 01:53:46.816
Hello!

01:53:47.024 --> 01:53:48.066
Hello!

01:53:50.358 --> 01:53:53.649
Gabbar is a bigger brand than you.

01:53:54.733 --> 01:53:57.899
These cowards didn't
make me Digvijay Patil.

01:53:58.316 --> 01:54:01.649
Digvijay Patil isn't human,
he's a brand!

01:55:55.941 --> 01:55:56.941
Sorry.

01:55:58.316 --> 01:55:59.108
Sorry.

01:56:05.233 --> 01:56:06.316
I am sorry.

01:56:27.941 --> 01:56:29.899
I hate sorry's

01:56:43.983 --> 01:56:44.941
Excuse me.

01:56:45.274 --> 01:56:46.066
What?

01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:48.441
Where's your CBI officer's cabin?

01:56:48.608 --> 01:56:50.649
Why?
- I want to meet him.

01:56:50.816 --> 01:56:52.441
Kuldeep sir doesn't meet everyone.

01:56:52.524 --> 01:56:53.691
What did you want from him?

01:56:53.983 --> 01:56:55.733
I wanted to talk
to him about Gabbar.

01:56:55.941 --> 01:56:57.316
Again Gabbar.

01:56:58.274 --> 01:56:59.108
What do I say?

01:56:59.316 --> 01:57:01.483
The Prime Minister's
here asking about Gabbar!

01:57:03.566 --> 01:57:06.524
Tell him..Gabbar's
here to talk to him.

01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:13.191
Sadhu.
- What?

01:57:13.274 --> 01:57:14.024
Gabbar.

01:57:14.108 --> 01:57:14.733
Gabbar what?

01:57:14.816 --> 01:57:15.816
Gabbar's here.

01:57:52.649 --> 01:57:53.983
Kuldeep Pawa.

01:57:54.399 --> 01:57:56.983
Professor Aditya,
from National College.

01:57:58.191 --> 01:57:59.191
Gabbar!

01:58:03.983 --> 01:58:05.149
Gabbar.

01:58:06.358 --> 01:58:08.358
I am here to surrender, sir.

01:58:09.774 --> 01:58:13.608
I killed one Collector in Latur,
one in Nashik..

01:58:14.024 --> 01:58:17.608
...a Police officer in Mumbai
and many other corrupt officers.

01:58:17.691 --> 01:58:20.733
And now..l just murdered
a well-known businessman.

01:58:21.274 --> 01:58:24.983
Digvijay Patil.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

01:58:26.399 --> 01:58:28.649
I take full responsibility
for all these murders.

01:58:29.941 --> 01:58:33.649
I planned all the murders.

01:58:33.858 --> 01:58:35.691
And I did it in complete sense.

01:58:36.233 --> 01:58:37.733
This is my fight.

01:58:38.358 --> 01:58:40.983
I request you to release..

01:58:41.233 --> 01:58:45.858
...all the honest officers
and students you have arrested.

01:58:59.483 --> 01:59:02.274
After all what is his mission?
Who is this Gabbar?

01:59:02.358 --> 01:59:04.316
Millions of people
have sent their petitions..

01:59:04.399 --> 01:59:06.483
...to the President asking
for the release of Gabbar.

01:59:06.566 --> 01:59:07.608
What do you say about that, sir?

01:59:07.691 --> 01:59:09.024
"This country
will never change."

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:10.358
How many times
have we said this?

01:59:10.441 --> 01:59:13.108
But now there is one person
who is trying to bring some change.

01:59:13.191 --> 01:59:14.733
I urge everyone
to come on the road..

01:59:14.816 --> 01:59:15.983
You can clearly see..

01:59:16.066 --> 01:59:17.483
...there are medical students,
art students..

01:59:17.566 --> 01:59:19.399
...and students from all
colleges are present here.

01:59:19.733 --> 01:59:22.733
You can see how they've
come on the road for Gabbar.

01:59:23.066 --> 01:59:24.483
"Free Gabbar. Free Gabbar."

01:59:24.566 --> 01:59:26.399
That's the slogan people
are shouting here too.

01:59:29.649 --> 01:59:32.816
The fear of Gabbar brought
some change to this picture.

01:59:34.733 --> 01:59:35.941
There's a rumor amongst people..

01:59:36.024 --> 01:59:37.399
...that Gabbar may be hanged.

01:59:37.483 --> 01:59:37.941
So the people..

01:59:38.024 --> 01:59:40.733
Gabbar is the phenomena
which has taken over India.

01:59:40.816 --> 01:59:43.774
People are on the roads
to lend their support to Gabbar.

01:59:43.858 --> 01:59:45.358
Rallies protesting
to free Gabbar..

01:59:45.441 --> 01:59:47.191
...are being held
all over the country.

01:59:47.483 --> 01:59:49.358
Gabbar will be taken
to court by this route.

01:59:49.441 --> 01:59:50.816
As you can see people
are protesting here?

01:59:50.899 --> 01:59:52.858
No one wants Gabbar to be punished.

01:59:52.941 --> 01:59:54.899
Let's see what the
judgment is going to be.

01:59:54.983 --> 01:59:57.316
As you can see,
everyone's shouting slogans..

01:59:57.399 --> 01:59:59.441
...of "Free Gabbar, Release Gabbar".

02:00:13.149 --> 02:00:17.858
Set Gabbar free!

02:00:17.941 --> 02:00:22.233
Set Gabbar free!

02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:26.108
The uniform's stopping me..

02:00:26.191 --> 02:00:27.858
...I would be shouting
slogans for you too.

02:00:36.441 --> 02:00:37.941
It's getting out of control.

02:00:39.358 --> 02:00:40.899
This way we'll never make it.

02:00:41.816 --> 02:00:43.691
They will only
listen to you, Aditya.

02:00:46.399 --> 02:00:47.816
Can you help me out here?

02:00:51.024 --> 02:00:52.774
Set Gabbar free!

02:01:08.399 --> 02:01:12.524
Gabbar. Gabbar.

02:01:12.608 --> 02:01:16.524
Gabbar. Gabbar.

02:01:23.649 --> 02:01:24.858
Shall we take attendance?

02:01:24.941 --> 02:01:25.941
Yes sir.

02:01:26.108 --> 02:01:27.649
They cannot harm you, sir.

02:01:27.733 --> 02:01:29.233
We'll go to the President, sir.

02:01:29.316 --> 02:01:31.191
He will have to pardon you.

02:01:31.649 --> 02:01:34.316
I never pardoned
any wrong guy.

02:01:35.566 --> 02:01:37.566
So how can
I ask pardon for myself?

02:01:37.649 --> 02:01:38.899
You're not the criminal, sir.

02:01:38.983 --> 02:01:40.441
What you did was right.

02:01:40.524 --> 02:01:41.649
If anything happens to you..

02:01:41.733 --> 02:01:43.399
...we will destroy this city.

02:01:43.483 --> 02:01:45.358
We'll show them
student power, sir.

02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:46.358
Student power!

02:01:46.691 --> 02:01:49.274
Student power!

02:01:49.358 --> 02:01:51.024
Student power!

02:01:51.108 --> 02:01:52.233
Yes.

02:01:53.191 --> 02:01:54.399
Student power.

02:01:56.816 --> 02:01:58.816
I am proud of student power.

02:01:59.399 --> 02:02:04.066
You know, not every student
becomes a government officer.

02:02:04.233 --> 02:02:08.441
But every government
officer is a student.

02:02:09.399 --> 02:02:12.066
Look..stop trying
to know your future..

02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:14.149
...and start shaking
up the corrupt people..

02:02:14.233 --> 02:02:15.649
...and say "Enough".

02:02:15.733 --> 02:02:17.524
You just shrug your
shoulders everywhere.

02:02:17.608 --> 02:02:19.816
"So what? What do we care?"

02:02:20.483 --> 02:02:21.858
Raise your hands.

02:02:21.941 --> 02:02:24.733
Shivaji Maharaj didn't
start any Whatsapp group.

02:02:24.816 --> 02:02:27.608
He set out alone,
and everyone joined him.

02:02:29.108 --> 02:02:30.524
You need to decide..

02:02:30.691 --> 02:02:33.983
...which direction you
want to take your country.

02:02:34.316 --> 02:02:36.524
Because you
are the future of India.

02:02:37.608 --> 02:02:39.858
You! The youth power!

02:02:40.191 --> 02:02:41.483
Be the change!

02:02:43.024 --> 02:02:45.233
I started
killing these people..

02:02:45.774 --> 02:02:47.691
...after I wrote my own death.

02:02:48.816 --> 02:02:50.233
After I'm dead..

02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:55.649
...don't burn down cars,
trains or taxis.

02:02:56.483 --> 02:02:57.899
If you really
want to do something..

02:02:58.358 --> 02:03:00.566
...then light
a fire in your heart.

02:03:02.066 --> 02:03:03.691
Gabbar will be happy.

02:03:04.191 --> 02:03:05.649
He'll be proud of you.

02:03:09.691 --> 02:03:11.816
Do you know
why I killed those people?

02:03:12.524 --> 02:03:14.441
Why I killed
those corrupt people?

02:03:15.149 --> 02:03:16.649
Can anyone tell me?

02:03:17.024 --> 02:03:18.191
I will tell you.

02:03:19.441 --> 02:03:21.649
Kill one corrupt guy..

02:03:23.316 --> 02:03:27.399
...and it'll be an eye-opener
for all the other corrupt people.

02:03:29.608 --> 02:03:32.066
And do you
know why I have to die?

02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:34.983
Because Gabbar was wrong.

02:03:36.358 --> 02:03:39.691
What I did was right.

02:03:40.441 --> 02:03:43.858
But the path I chose was wrong.

02:03:44.274 --> 02:03:46.191
Because I didn't have a choice.

02:03:46.649 --> 02:03:47.774
I had to do it.

02:03:50.899 --> 02:03:52.858
Do you know who Gabbar is?

02:03:52.941 --> 02:03:57.441
Every man who doesn't
turn his back to injustice..

02:03:57.733 --> 02:03:58.774
...that's Gabbar.

02:03:59.399 --> 02:04:01.774
Someone who
beats up the corrupt..

02:04:01.941 --> 02:04:03.066
...that's Gabbar.

02:04:04.316 --> 02:04:08.316
Someone who makes corrupt
government officials..

02:04:08.399 --> 02:04:09.649
...sweat even in their AC cabins.

02:04:09.733 --> 02:04:10.733
That's Gabbar.

02:04:10.816 --> 02:04:12.108
If I had been
from National College..

02:04:12.191 --> 02:04:13.358
...I would've been with you too.

02:04:13.566 --> 02:04:15.608
Sadhuram,
you can still do great things..

02:04:15.858 --> 02:04:18.441
...from where you are.

02:04:19.983 --> 02:04:21.524
Which one of you is Gabbar?

02:04:21.608 --> 02:04:22.899
I'm The Gabbar.

02:04:22.983 --> 02:04:23.858
Who is Gabbar?

02:04:23.941 --> 02:04:24.983
I'm The Gabbar.

02:04:25.066 --> 02:04:26.024
Who is Gabbar?

02:04:26.108 --> 02:04:27.149
I'm The Gabbar.

02:04:29.774 --> 02:04:31.399
Want to know a Google fact?

02:04:31.691 --> 02:04:33.816
One kiss burns many calories.

02:04:35.108 --> 02:04:37.649
Want to lose some weight..
before I die.

02:04:43.524 --> 02:04:44.483
No..

02:04:49.524 --> 02:04:51.983
If anyone tries to take bribe again..

02:04:52.066 --> 02:04:54.483
...a voice
will echo in his heart.

02:04:54.566 --> 02:04:56.441
Don't take bribe, or else..

02:04:56.524 --> 02:04:57.983
Gabbar will show up!

02:04:58.066 --> 02:05:00.274
Or else?
- Gabbar will show up!

02:05:00.358 --> 02:05:02.691
Or else?
- Gabbar will show up!

02:05:02.899 --> 02:05:04.108
Gabbar will show up!

02:05:23.691 --> 02:05:25.316
I will be dead.

02:05:26.191 --> 02:05:28.274
What about you, Kaalia?
