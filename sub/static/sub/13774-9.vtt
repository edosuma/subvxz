WEBVTT

00:01.033 --> 00:04.349
This is another one of the motions
we filed this morning.

00:04.469 --> 00:05.951
We have to be careful.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.298
Excuse me one sec.

00:08.418 --> 00:09.696
- Taco?
- Hi.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.383
I knew one day you'd get arrested.
What did you do?

00:12.503 --> 00:13.991
- No, I came for the show.
- What show?

00:14.111 --> 00:16.355
My favorite show is Judge O'Brien
and my cable's out, so...

00:16.599 --> 00:17.923
I figured this will be the next best thing.

00:18.043 --> 00:19.796
- Put the popcorn away.
- Ooh.

00:19.916 --> 00:22.562
Are you a sassy judge or a brassy judge?

00:22.682 --> 00:24.610
I'm not a judge, Taco,
I'm a lawyer.

00:24.730 --> 00:27.346
Please don't do anything
that's gonna embarrass me.

00:27.466 --> 00:29.715
- You know what, I'm missing out.
- You're missing nothing.

00:29.835 --> 00:32.677
If it pleases the court, could you
go back just a little bit?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.723
Young man, would you please
sit down and be quiet?

00:34.843 --> 00:36.689
Is she guilty?
She looks guilty.

00:36.809 --> 00:38.764
Sit down and be quiet.

00:38.884 --> 00:39.523
Bailiff...

00:39.867 --> 00:41.667
Ooh. Permission to approach
the bench, Your Honor?

00:41.735 --> 00:42.635
Sit down.

00:42.703 --> 00:43.442
Absolutely.

00:43.562 --> 00:46.805

00:47.074 --> 00:50.176
Dude, I got a case
this week, super ugly woman.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.811
Just total bowser.

00:51.879 --> 00:55.748
Gets into a car accident, sues
the brake pad company, they pay

00:55.816 --> 00:59.252
her for plastic surgery,
now she's super hot.

00:59.319 --> 01:03.055
But on top of that, she's now
suing for emotional distress,

01:03.123 --> 01:04.322
and I'm, like, "Excuse me.

01:04.391 --> 01:07.044
"We just paid for you to get
super hot.

01:07.164 --> 01:09.190
Why would we give you
more money on top of it?

01:09.310 --> 01:10.633
Not a little overconfident there?

01:10.753 --> 01:13.266
Mm-mmm. I'm gonna win it because
I have a secret weapon.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.200
What is it?

01:14.268 --> 01:15.501
The judge is totally into me.

01:15.569 --> 01:17.870
You're flirting with a
judge to gain legal favor?

01:17.938 --> 01:20.072
She's just my work flirt.
What?

01:20.140 --> 01:21.841
Just a way to pass the time.

01:21.909 --> 01:24.443
After I got married, I shut down
my flirt thrusters completely.

01:24.511 --> 01:25.444
I can't do it anymore.

01:25.512 --> 01:28.414
Dude, when you're married, you have
to keep a work flirt, all right?

01:28.482 --> 01:30.082
It keeps the flirt muscles limber.

01:33.921 --> 01:36.589
I went from married and sitting
to single and sprinting,

01:36.657 --> 01:37.890
and I strained a testicle.

01:37.958 --> 01:39.692
It's not good.
I never got plastic surgery.

01:39.760 --> 01:40.893
Asian eyes.

01:40.961 --> 01:42.895
We're not talking about
Asian eyes here.

01:42.963 --> 01:45.298
We paid for her own personal
episode of The Swan.

01:45.365 --> 01:48.034
You know, actually,
90% of women who get plastic

01:48.101 --> 01:49.769
surgery lead better lives:

01:49.836 --> 01:51.804
higher pay grades and
less divorce rates.

01:51.872 --> 01:52.939
Are you for real?

01:53.006 --> 01:54.206
Yeah, of course I'm for real.

01:54.274 --> 01:56.075
Would you be willing
to testify about this?

01:56.143 --> 01:57.276
What do you mean?

01:57.344 --> 02:00.246
Would you be interested in testifying
for me as an expert witness?

02:00.314 --> 02:02.772
Yeah! Oh, yes, I'm in!

02:02.892 --> 02:05.551
I get to go up g on the stand ad
perform in front of all these people?

02:05.619 --> 02:06.252
No, not really.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.621
Oh, we're gonna go out to
lunch with my bro-bros!

02:08.689 --> 02:09.722
Not bro-bros.

02:09.789 --> 02:12.258
I know the best sausage
place downtown.

02:12.326 --> 02:14.126
Is that Kowalkski's?
No, no, Mickey's.

02:14.194 --> 02:16.395
Mickey's is terrible.
Mickey's is the best.

02:16.463 --> 02:17.830
Trust me. I'm an expert.

02:17.898 --> 02:20.166
You're an expert on the
Brazilian Butt Lift.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.734
Tell you what.
It'll be my treat.

02:21.802 --> 02:23.903
I'll bring all you guys down
there, have some sausage

02:23.971 --> 02:26.505
at my place, and then we can
try Andre's shitty place

02:26.573 --> 02:27.840
Mickey's and we'll compare.

02:27.908 --> 02:29.508
That's not a, not a...
I gotta roll.

02:29.576 --> 02:30.977
Good to see you, buddy.
All right, guys.

02:31.044 --> 02:32.078
I'm out.
Bye.

02:32.145 --> 02:33.512
This'll be fun.
What is that?

02:33.580 --> 02:35.615
You steal my thunder?
I'm not stealing your thunder.

02:35.682 --> 02:38.250
I merely escorted them to
a more interesting storm.

02:38.318 --> 02:41.754
To be honest with you, Andre, there
wasn't much to steal to begin with.

02:41.822 --> 02:44.023
Yeah.
Peyton Hillis is out this week.

02:44.091 --> 02:45.958
I'm gonna pick me up some Mike Bell.

02:46.026 --> 02:48.661
Except for the fact
that I will be picking up Mike

02:48.729 --> 02:51.464
Bell because I have number one
priority on the waiver wire.

02:51.531 --> 02:54.100
But you don't need Mike Bell.
I know!

02:54.167 --> 02:56.268
I need Mike Bell.
I know.

02:56.336 --> 02:58.971
But...
What to do?

02:59.039 --> 03:01.641
What if you didn't pick up Mike Bell?

03:01.708 --> 03:03.042
Why wouldn't I pick him up?

03:03.110 --> 03:04.210
Love.

03:04.277 --> 03:06.345
Are you trying to collude with me?

03:06.413 --> 03:08.180
Shh.
Don't put words in my mouth.

03:08.248 --> 03:09.215
There's no colluding.

03:09.282 --> 03:10.216
I'll say this.

03:10.283 --> 03:13.519
If this was to occur, I would
give you some really good sex.

03:13.587 --> 03:14.720
Really?

03:14.788 --> 03:16.122
I'd be willing to do that.

03:16.189 --> 03:17.156
I would try my best.

03:17.224 --> 03:19.058
Do you not try your best now?

03:19.126 --> 03:23.305
I will give you 100% for four minutes,
and then,

03:23.425 --> 03:25.834
like 60% for the 5 minutes after.

03:25.954 --> 03:27.781
And then after that
you're on your own.

03:27.901 --> 03:30.002
You naughty little commissioner.
Yeah!

03:30.070 --> 03:33.005
You know what you can do are all
of Ellie's thank-you notes.

03:33.073 --> 03:34.807
Why doesn't Ellie do her
own thank-you notes?

03:34.875 --> 03:36.842
'Cause Ellie doesn't need Mike Bell.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.177
Excuse me.

03:38.245 --> 03:39.311
Can I talk to you?

03:39.379 --> 03:41.547
Are you that girl who
does all the drawings?

03:41.615 --> 03:43.349
Yeah, I'm the courtroom artist.

03:43.417 --> 03:44.583
Hey, I wasn't here yesterday.

03:44.651 --> 03:46.752
Do you mind showing me what I missed?

03:46.820 --> 03:48.020
Sure, yeah.

03:48.088 --> 03:49.188
Let's see.

03:49.256 --> 03:50.656
Whoa! I remember this guy.

03:50.724 --> 03:52.892
He poisoned all those
kids with the yogurt.

03:52.959 --> 03:55.327
Yeah. You are good.

03:55.395 --> 03:56.595
Arturo was guilty?

03:56.663 --> 03:58.731
I thought he was such a nice nice guy.

03:58.799 --> 04:00.900
I guess he did drown
all those old people.

04:00.967 --> 04:03.903
I should be, like, back here.

04:03.970 --> 04:05.004
Oh, that might be you.

04:05.072 --> 04:07.554
Well, well, well, it's Mr. Ruxin.

04:07.674 --> 04:08.941
Call me "Rodney," Your Honor.

04:09.009 --> 04:11.043
Who lets you walk around
here dressed like that?

04:11.111 --> 04:13.446
Are you kidding me?
This is Brooks Brothers head to toe.

04:13.513 --> 04:15.347
You know you're not in
The Great Gatsby, right?

04:15.415 --> 04:17.550
You know you're not in a
Nancy Meyers movie, right?

04:17.617 --> 04:19.785
You're such a dog.

04:19.853 --> 04:20.785
Ruff-ruff.

04:20.904 --> 04:22.588
I'll see you in court, Counselor.

04:23.656 --> 04:26.170
Oh, hey, Russ man!

04:26.290 --> 04:27.551
I don't know you here.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.669
I've seen that guy around.

04:29.789 --> 04:31.297
He's a dick.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.432
All right guys, I need your help.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.069
When I'm on the witness stand, what says
"expert witness" more, this or this?

04:37.137 --> 04:39.472
I mean, this is a little bit
more "man of the people."

04:39.539 --> 04:42.808
Who are the people that you are
supposedly a man of with that outfit?

04:42.876 --> 04:45.878
My guess, it's a country entirely
populated by fans of Aerosmith.

04:45.946 --> 04:47.413
So lose the vest?

04:47.481 --> 04:48.647
Lose the whole thing.

04:48.715 --> 04:51.207
You just want to look credible.

04:51.327 --> 04:53.886
Have a seat on the witness stand and
let's just run one through, okay?

04:53.954 --> 04:55.408
- Okay, I got this.
- Okay.

04:56.890 --> 04:58.057
Why are you wearing glasses?

04:58.125 --> 04:59.225
To look smart.

04:59.292 --> 05:01.627
It makes you look like a guy
in To Catch a Predator.

05:01.695 --> 05:03.929
Like one of those guys that
sticks his head in, he's,

05:03.997 --> 05:04.997
like, "Oh, maybe not today."

05:05.065 --> 05:07.266
Yeah, maybe not today.
I escaped. I'm the smart one.

05:07.334 --> 05:10.102
Oh, good, so you look like
a crafty sexual predator.

05:10.170 --> 05:11.504
Take the glasses off, please?

05:11.571 --> 05:12.505
Let's start.

05:12.572 --> 05:15.441
Can you please state your name
and occupation for the record?

05:15.509 --> 05:17.343
Yes.
Yes, what?

05:17.410 --> 05:18.844
What's your name?
Just say your name.

05:18.912 --> 05:20.846
Say your name.
You have to just say it.

05:20.914 --> 05:22.748
Yes. Dr. Andre Nozick.

05:22.816 --> 05:25.184
Doctor of plastic surgery.

05:25.252 --> 05:27.253
What are you doing?
What is that?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.021
I'm addressing the jury.

05:29.089 --> 05:30.122
I'm giving them double guns.

05:30.190 --> 05:32.191
Don't ever address the
jury with double guns.

05:32.259 --> 05:33.159
Holster the guns?

05:33.226 --> 05:35.261
Don't holster the guns,
don't take the guns out.

05:35.328 --> 05:36.195
All right.

05:36.263 --> 05:38.597
Are you an expert in the
field of plastic surgery?

05:38.665 --> 05:39.951
Depends.

05:39.985 --> 05:41.288
No, it doesn't depend.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.519
It sounds like bragging.
I don't wanna be bragging.

05:43.639 --> 05:45.971
I'm asking the question!
Let's move on.

05:46.039 --> 05:47.773
Have I seen your mother naked?

05:47.841 --> 05:49.175
I don't know. What? No!

05:49.242 --> 05:50.509
The answer is yes.
What?!

05:50.577 --> 05:53.612
And I liked what I saw, and I want
that written down in the record.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.115
And the defense would like to add
that he has seen her naked as well.

05:56.183 --> 05:58.117
No, you haven't.
And she has a huge bush.

05:58.185 --> 05:59.785
That's because she can't
shave down there.

05:59.853 --> 06:01.620
She's got razor burn.
How would you know that?

06:03.056 --> 06:05.024
What? What?
Why are you blinking now?

06:05.091 --> 06:06.525
Because you got me all nervous.

06:06.593 --> 06:08.527
Oh, great, my expert witness
blinks when he's nervous.

06:08.595 --> 06:10.796
He's gonna be really
credible on the stand.

06:10.864 --> 06:13.499
I'm very credible.
What is going on, you guys?

06:13.567 --> 06:16.068
And why are you wearing those glasses?

06:16.136 --> 06:17.369
You like 'em?

06:17.437 --> 06:18.704
No, I don't.

06:18.772 --> 06:21.207
Listen, sweetie, you were gonna
get on writing those thank-you

06:21.274 --> 06:22.675
notes for Ellie's birthday party?

06:22.742 --> 06:26.078
Yes. I left them over here, and I
will have them out by tomorrow.

06:26.146 --> 06:28.848
Thank you. Andre, do not
wear those in the house.

06:28.915 --> 06:30.516
They are going to creep Ellie out.

06:30.584 --> 06:32.651
I would never want to do that.

06:32.719 --> 06:33.719
I like Ellie.

06:33.787 --> 06:34.720
Just stop.

06:34.788 --> 06:36.021
She's such a pretty girl.

06:36.089 --> 06:37.523
Stop. Thank you, sweetie.
I love you.

06:37.591 --> 06:39.258
You're welcome.
Something ain't right here.

06:39.326 --> 06:40.359
What are you talking about?

06:40.427 --> 06:41.360
I'm talking about collusion.

06:41.428 --> 06:42.895
Why would you think I'm colluding?

06:42.963 --> 06:46.098
Your wife asked you to do something,
and you did it on the first ask.

06:46.166 --> 06:49.101
It takes my wife three asks
before I'll do something menial

06:49.169 --> 06:50.502
like take the trash out.

06:50.570 --> 06:52.758
And we have a loving marriage.

06:52.878 --> 06:54.173
What are you getting at, Ruxin?

06:54.241 --> 06:57.176
How did Mike Bell just
fall into your lap, Kevin?

06:57.244 --> 06:58.844
Jenny didn't need Mike Bell.

06:58.912 --> 07:01.280
Something don't smell
right here, Kevin.

07:01.348 --> 07:03.075
Where are you going?
I'm going to go take a piss.

07:03.195 --> 07:04.729
Bye, Columbo.

07:06.686 --> 07:09.054
Ruxin, what are you doing?

07:09.122 --> 07:11.891
Oh... I'm just digging
through your computers.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.025
Why are you doing that?

07:13.093 --> 07:14.393
Why are you and Kevin colluding?

07:14.461 --> 07:16.729
Have you ever been diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia?

07:16.796 --> 07:19.565
They brought me in for an
evaluation in middle school, but

07:19.633 --> 07:22.902
I left before the psychiatrist
could give me his final diagnosis.

07:22.969 --> 07:24.703
'Cause he
had it out for me.

07:24.771 --> 07:26.305
No more questions, Your Honor.

07:26.373 --> 07:28.307
What do we got here?
My laundry.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.209
Yeah, it's pretty dirty.

07:30.277 --> 07:31.744
Sad little man, no!

07:31.811 --> 07:35.381
By the way, I need to trade badly, and
Taco's the best guy to trade with.

07:35.448 --> 07:37.483
Taco will never trade with anyone.

07:37.550 --> 07:38.317
He is impermeable.

07:38.385 --> 07:43.155
Well, he has not come face to
face with Andre, the expert.

07:43.223 --> 07:45.958
What, are you gonna lure him into your
bed and fondle the trade out of him?

07:46.026 --> 07:47.459
If that's what it takes.

07:51.646 --> 07:52.606
So good.

07:52.726 --> 07:54.235
Could eat this whole thing.

07:54.303 --> 07:57.049
Actually did eat one of these
whole things one time.

07:57.169 --> 07:59.290
- What?
- You ate a whole Chefo's wide load?

07:59.410 --> 08:01.494
- Wide load was in my belly.
- No way.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.945
When I was in residency, I
did this 24-hour shift.

08:04.013 --> 08:05.802
Whole thing, ate it.

08:05.922 --> 08:07.975
You ever try the stromboli?
The Holy Stromboli?

08:08.095 --> 08:10.159
The Holy Stromboli.
I've tried; I shared it.

08:10.279 --> 08:11.238
But have you ever eaten the whole thing?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.088
It's five pounds of, like,
dough, meat and chee...

08:13.155 --> 08:14.689
You can't physically have that.

08:14.757 --> 08:16.891
I actually did it twice...
once while it was still hot.

08:16.959 --> 08:19.527
I saw him.
Really, Tony Collusion?

08:19.647 --> 08:20.401
Oh, stop.

08:20.521 --> 08:23.517
You are a sad man to steal
my thunder like that.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.200
Hello, boys.
Hey.

08:25.267 --> 08:26.901
Why didn't you come
through the front door?

08:26.969 --> 08:28.403
I don't use front anything.

08:28.471 --> 08:30.253
Taco, you seem happy.

08:30.373 --> 08:34.801
Because I just had a wonderful date, and
she's the courtroom artist from court.

08:34.921 --> 08:36.010
Details, girlfriend.
Don't say that.

08:36.078 --> 08:38.130
Don't do that.
Come on.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.328
Check it out.
Ooh.

08:40.448 --> 08:42.462
Yeah, this is me singing
to her in the park.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.183
She really captures your inner hobo.
Whoa!

08:45.251 --> 08:46.651
And then...

08:46.719 --> 08:48.887
...she left this
in my sketch pad.

08:48.955 --> 08:50.283
This is a sex sketch.

08:50.403 --> 08:52.524
You guys know what
that means, right? No.

08:52.592 --> 08:55.026
I have to make a sexy sketch
myself and send it to her.

08:55.094 --> 08:56.328
Oh, it's like pic for pic.

08:56.395 --> 08:58.597
Yeah, but I'm not
really good at drawing.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.899
Can any of you guys draw me?
No.

09:00.967 --> 09:03.101
I'll do it. I'll draw you.
Awesome.

09:03.169 --> 09:04.569
So you'll draw me naked?

09:04.637 --> 09:06.738
What? Na... Why?
It's got to match.

09:06.806 --> 09:09.240
It's got to be very sexual.
Quid pro quo.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.709
Come on, I'll owe you.

09:10.776 --> 09:12.110
Please.

09:12.178 --> 09:13.745
Oh. Yeah.

09:13.813 --> 09:15.046
Yeah, let's do this.

09:15.114 --> 09:16.615
Now, should I be erect?

09:16.682 --> 09:18.116
I think Andre would love that.

09:18.184 --> 09:20.785
Oh, yeah, I'm having an open house.
Should I trim the lawn?

09:20.853 --> 09:23.121
Maybe not trim, but you should
definitely shave the shaft.

09:23.189 --> 09:23.755
Yeah?

09:23.823 --> 09:26.057
Or better than that, Andre
will shave the shaft.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.359
I'm not shaving shaft.

09:27.426 --> 09:28.860
Andre, you shave shaft.

09:28.928 --> 09:31.563
Yes, I've shaved shaft,
in a medical environment.

09:31.631 --> 09:33.565
But you are technically
a shaft shaver.

09:33.633 --> 09:34.633
Technically, yes.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.388
How many shafts do you
think you've shaved?

09:39.108 --> 09:41.439
I think that Kevin and
Jenny are colluding.

09:41.507 --> 09:42.807
No.
Yes.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.211
And they're gonna work together, and
it's gonna keep me out of the playoffs.

09:46.278 --> 09:47.646
Just relax, okay?

09:47.713 --> 09:49.414
And I know that Kevin
tells you everything.

09:49.482 --> 09:50.548
Hey, I know her.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.817
Yeah, don't change the subject on me.
No, no, no, no.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.086
She used to work in the
same building as me.

09:55.154 --> 09:57.822
Really nice girl, just
empirically unattractive.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.391
Yeah.
How do you know her?

09:59.458 --> 10:00.492
She's the brake pad girl.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.128
That's craz... Whoa.
Who is that?

10:03.195 --> 10:04.796
That's the brake
pad girl 2.0.

10:04.864 --> 10:09.501
What do you...
That became that because of that.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.468
That's pretty amazing.

10:10.536 --> 10:12.303
You might actually have
a legitimate case here.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.020
So you find her attractive, huh?

10:14.140 --> 10:15.530
Would you mind hooking me up with her?

10:15.940 --> 10:17.840
I think I can get th two of you
in a room together.

10:23.552 --> 10:25.350
Andre?

10:27.182 --> 10:28.426
Enter, Taco.

10:28.546 --> 10:30.161
What are you wearing on your head?

10:30.281 --> 10:31.192
It's a head massager.

10:31.745 --> 10:35.420
I need my senses at an all-time high
for my expert testimony tomorrow.

10:35.540 --> 10:36.731
You gonna wear that
while you sketch me?

10:37.967 --> 10:39.467
That would be impossible.

10:39.535 --> 10:41.338
Makes my eyes vibrate.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.848
Oh, good, 'cause it's
kind of freaking me out.

10:43.968 --> 10:45.039
Come, Taco.

10:45.107 --> 10:47.875
Let our work together begin.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.421
Are you ready?
I'm nervous.

10:50.541 --> 10:51.412
Shh.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.009
Disrobe.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.750
Yes.

10:55.818 --> 10:57.496
Very nice.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.851
What should I do?
Shh!

11:00.971 --> 11:02.095
Be still, my muse.

11:02.215 --> 11:03.776
Let the artist work.

11:05.338 --> 11:06.828
Does it look good?

11:06.895 --> 11:11.132
Now we come to the issue of this.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.641
Oh, my junk?

11:12.761 --> 11:14.210
It's quite cold in here.

11:14.330 --> 11:18.351
If you could imagine it in a warm,
humid environment, like a jumpsuit.

11:18.471 --> 11:19.294
Mm.

11:19.414 --> 11:23.118
- And I don't know if you noticed, but
it does have a slight, um... - Lilt.

11:23.238 --> 11:24.208
Yeah.

11:24.328 --> 11:26.912
And as you can see, the cold
has not reduced the bend.

11:27.032 --> 11:29.050
I will capture it thusly.
Okay.

11:29.118 --> 11:32.325
You know, it occurs to me,
Taco, that since I'm doing you

11:32.445 --> 11:36.491
this favor, perhaps you could do me
a favor, in the form of a trade.

11:36.558 --> 11:38.265
Yeah, okay, why not.

11:38.385 --> 11:39.478
Okay, uh, great.

11:39.598 --> 11:43.359
Um, I actually logged
into your account here.

11:43.479 --> 11:44.862
How'd you know my password?

11:44.982 --> 11:48.038
Your team name is Password Is Taco, so...

11:48.158 --> 11:50.089
I thought my team name was
The Encino Men.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.158
No.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.448
Oh, look at this.

11:52.568 --> 11:55.619
You have Ray Rice... he's all
right... and, oh,

11:55.739 --> 11:58.112
I have David Akers, Philadelphia kicker.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.239
Akers?
I don't want to give him up to you, but...

12:00.359 --> 12:02.139
All right, so he'd make my team better?

12:02.259 --> 12:03.356
Yeah, big-time.

12:03.476 --> 12:04.832
Okay, yeah, let's do that.

12:04.952 --> 12:06.177
How do you actually do that?

12:06.297 --> 12:07.940
'Cause I never know how
to trade with people.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.383
You could step back.
Just step back into the artist circle.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.365
Is this my... what is this button?

12:12.485 --> 12:14.114
Is this how you trade?

12:14.234 --> 12:17.153
Um... And, okay, say I
want... Whoa, this is soft.

12:17.273 --> 12:18.935
That's, like, a mock
turtleneck, right?

12:19.055 --> 12:20.657
Uh-huh.
Let me just see a second.

12:20.777 --> 12:22.357
It's machine washed, too.

12:22.477 --> 12:24.230
Oh, you are tense.

12:24.350 --> 12:27.004
You need to relax a little bit.
Loosen up your shoulders.

12:27.124 --> 12:28.371
Yeah, I don't need that.
Relax.

12:28.491 --> 12:31.641
I think I'm fine.
Hey, Andre, movie starts in about... Okay...

12:31.761 --> 12:32.773
We're just making a trade.

12:32.893 --> 12:34.645
- Excellent.
- See ya, Pete.

12:35.110 --> 12:37.666
There you go, there you go.

12:41.896 --> 12:43.126
Ruxin, hey.

12:43.836 --> 12:46.064
- I'm having second thoughts about the vest.
- I told you not to wear the vest.

12:46.184 --> 12:48.306
Ok, ***
cause I think this is the constitution.

12:48.426 --> 12:50.860
Alright, it's not the constitution,
it's just French bullshit.

12:51.762 --> 12:53.361
- But I'm thinking about tie...
- Get back there.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.660
Okay, okay, wow.

12:54.780 --> 12:56.620
- You're weird.
- ***

12:57.153 --> 12:59.408
- Get out. Just stop it.
- Okay, okay.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.917
- Sit down and shut up.
- Okay, okay.

13:01.037 --> 13:02.106
Hey, Columbo.

13:02.543 --> 13:04.225
Oh, Mike Bell had a big week, huh?
Did he?

13:04.292 --> 13:06.627
I don't remember.
Hey.

13:06.695 --> 13:08.162
Wait a minute, what
are you doing here?

13:08.230 --> 13:09.763
Well, I work here.
No, not you, him.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.931
I came to support my friends.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.633
You came here to steal my thunder.

13:12.701 --> 13:14.568
There is no thunder
to steal, all right?

13:14.636 --> 13:16.237
You're paranoid.
Don't get in my head.

13:16.304 --> 13:17.513
Don't get in my head.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.386
You shouldn't eat Oreos so fast.

13:19.506 --> 13:20.922
I'll be okay in an hour.

13:21.042 --> 13:23.787
Have a nice day at work,
my little Mozart.

13:24.646 --> 13:26.513
All rise.

13:26.581 --> 13:27.948
Court is now in session.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.184
The Honorable Judge
Humphrey presiding.

13:30.252 --> 13:32.019
Please be seated.

13:32.087 --> 13:33.787
Thank you so much for
being here today.

13:33.855 --> 13:34.521
You're welcome.

13:34.589 --> 13:36.690
And I think we all wish it was
under better circumstances.

13:36.758 --> 13:39.360
But I would like to say that you,
uh, you look very beautiful.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.435
Thank you.

13:40.555 --> 13:41.528
Bet you hear that a lot now.

13:41.596 --> 13:43.430
A fair amount.
Fair amount.

13:44.699 --> 13:48.205
More than you did, let's say,
a year and a half ago?

13:48.325 --> 13:49.803
Gosh, it's hard to remember for sure.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.972
Um, possibly.
Possibly.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.841
It's unbelievable the transformation.

13:53.908 --> 13:56.810
I think I'm gonna have to
rekindle this thing a little bit.

13:56.878 --> 13:59.847
And, uh, you moved
into a new apartment?

13:59.914 --> 14:00.547
Yes.

14:00.615 --> 14:03.350
Are you paying more or less for
this new place than the old place?

14:03.418 --> 14:04.718
Currently, I am not paying.

14:04.786 --> 14:07.521
It's a recession special
for five months.

14:07.589 --> 14:09.023
Wow.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.425
You know, recession special for
me is usually when you buy two

14:11.493 --> 14:13.394
hot dogs, you get a free grape drink.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.030
But I'm just a simple man
with simple pleasures.

14:16.097 --> 14:18.832
Um, I guess what we've been
dancing around, and I'll just

14:18.900 --> 14:24.171
ask very directly is... would you
say that your life is markedly

14:24.291 --> 14:26.631
better since you got in the accident?

14:27.942 --> 14:29.009
I'll allow.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.778
Please answer the question.

14:30.845 --> 14:33.480
I was in a horrible accident.

14:33.548 --> 14:35.916
And I am the victim of
much unwanted attention.

14:35.984 --> 14:39.053
Okay, so what you're telling
these noble citizens of the jury

14:39.120 --> 14:42.589
is that your life is more difficult
now because you're pretty?

14:42.657 --> 14:43.691
Is that what you're saying?

14:43.758 --> 14:47.861
- Not exactly... - I guess my final
question is, isn't your life much better

14:47.929 --> 14:48.996
since the accident?

14:49.064 --> 14:50.164
True or false... true.

14:50.231 --> 14:51.432
No further questions.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.233
Thank you for your time.

14:56.290 --> 14:58.572
Could you state your name
for the court, please?

14:58.640 --> 15:03.277
My name is...
my name is Slim Shady... No.

15:03.345 --> 15:06.880
- I mean... - Please just state
your name for the jury, please.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.048
Andre, Andre Nozick.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.383
Dr. Andre Nozick?

15:09.451 --> 15:10.718
Okay.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.186
And what is your profession?

15:12.253 --> 15:15.198
I am a expert witness.

15:15.318 --> 15:16.824
That's not your profession.

15:16.944 --> 15:19.123
- I am a...
- Without the guns...

15:19.243 --> 15:21.895
I am a plastic surgeon.

15:22.015 --> 15:23.197
Put your hands away.

15:23.264 --> 15:25.032
Don't holster them.
Don't holster them.

15:25.100 --> 15:28.094
Would you mind taking a look
at the exhibits over there?

15:28.214 --> 15:31.593
- You can see photos of the plaintiff...
- Okay, hold on a second.

15:34.609 --> 15:39.947
Photos of the plaintiff before her car
accident and after her accident.

15:40.014 --> 15:42.983
And how would you say
the plastic surgery is?

15:43.051 --> 15:44.818
Uh, the surgery is excellent.

15:44.886 --> 15:46.553
It's very natural.

15:46.621 --> 15:49.656
And one would wonder what she
looked like as a little girl.

15:51.292 --> 15:53.227
I don't think we need
to wonder about that.

15:53.294 --> 15:56.930
And you can take the glasses off; they're
making you look like a total idiot.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.566
So you've written a number
of studies, isn't that true?

15:59.634 --> 16:04.605
Uh, 90%... Oh... ...of women...
It's soupy. Look at him.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.173
Why is he sweating like that?

16:06.241 --> 16:10.444
...who are affected by plastic
surgery, are oftentimes

16:10.512 --> 16:13.180
in better relationships...
So I have no further questions.

16:13.248 --> 16:14.314
I'm done with this witness.

16:14.382 --> 16:16.250
But I can... I can stay.
Please sit down.

16:16.317 --> 16:19.186
The defense would like to call its
next witness... Mr. Pete Eckhart.

16:19.254 --> 16:20.821
What?! No!
No!

16:20.889 --> 16:21.989
Let's go.

16:22.056 --> 16:24.158
What is going on?
Please step down, sir.

16:24.225 --> 16:27.027
Hi there.
There's a thunderstorm brewing.

16:27.095 --> 16:30.864
It's not your thunder.
I'm the expert. I am innocent.

16:30.932 --> 16:33.267
And if it pleases the court, I
would like the last witness's

16:33.334 --> 16:34.268
vest stricken from the record.

16:34.335 --> 16:35.502
Good call.
Thank you.

16:35.570 --> 16:37.104
Please state your name for the court.

16:37.172 --> 16:39.506
My name's Pete Eckhart, and,
guys, I want to keep this short

16:39.574 --> 16:41.642
and sweet because we've all
got better things to do.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.110
No offense.
None taken.

16:43.178 --> 16:44.144
All right, let's do this.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.448
Mr. Eckhart, do you see the woman
sitting here in court today?

16:47.515 --> 16:48.515
I do see her, yes.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.851
Would you say that she's
objectively attractive?

16:50.919 --> 16:53.687
I would say objectively
gorgeous and, as a man, I would

16:53.755 --> 16:55.823
kill to have a date
with a woman like that.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.191
I was the expert witness.

16:57.258 --> 16:58.892
Well, he's doing really well.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.027
Do you know this woman?

17:00.094 --> 17:01.328
I do know her a bit.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.464
We worked in the same
building for a while.

17:03.531 --> 17:05.833
And she looked different
then, correct?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.569
Yes, she did.
You, in fact, had a nickname for her?

17:08.636 --> 17:10.471
Yes, I did.
What was her nickname?

17:10.538 --> 17:12.406
Das Dinge.
Das Dinge?

17:12.473 --> 17:13.740
Well, what does that mean?

17:13.808 --> 17:15.209
It's German...
Mm-hmm.

17:15.276 --> 17:16.676
...for "The Thing."

17:16.743 --> 17:19.079
Oh, it's German for "The Thing."

17:20.882 --> 17:22.082
Well, thank you.

17:22.150 --> 17:24.017
I have no further questions.
Excellent.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.877
Actually, you know what, I
do have one last question.

17:26.997 --> 17:29.654
Did Kevin McArthur collude with his wife Jenny

17:29.774 --> 17:32.168
in Fantasy Football this
week to get Mike Bell?

17:32.288 --> 17:34.123
- Objection, Your Honor.
- You can't object

17:34.243 --> 17:35.639
Ask him about the hot Stromboli!

17:35.759 --> 17:37.331
Doctor, I have warned you!
It's five pounds!

17:37.398 --> 17:38.632
Order!
Answer me!

17:38.700 --> 17:39.366
You are under oath!

17:39.434 --> 17:41.668
Did Kevin get Mike Bell
through collusion?!

17:41.736 --> 17:42.736
Of course he colluded.

17:42.804 --> 17:44.404
How else would he have
gotten Mike Bell?

17:44.472 --> 17:45.372
Oh, horseshit!

17:45.440 --> 17:46.673
What are you talking about?!

17:46.741 --> 17:48.876
He did it!
He ate the stromboli!

17:48.943 --> 17:50.911
I swear to you!
Order in the court!

17:50.979 --> 17:53.247
I will have you all thrown
in jail for contempt.

17:53.314 --> 17:57.932
Counselor, your behavior here today
has been bizarre and reprehensible.

17:58.052 --> 18:00.912
I want to see you in my chambers now.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.478
Hi.
Das Dinge?

18:02.598 --> 18:04.515
That was just a story I made
up to help out my friend.

18:04.635 --> 18:06.804
You were under oath.
I can explain all this to you.

18:06.924 --> 18:07.995
Would you have dinner with me?
Some drinks, maybe?

18:08.062 --> 18:08.629
No.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.996
Okay, well, I'm here, you're
here; think about it.

18:11.116 --> 18:13.170
Really? What?
I was under oath.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.632
What am I supposed to do?

18:14.752 --> 18:16.136
Oh, shit.

18:16.204 --> 18:17.204
Taco.

18:17.272 --> 18:18.805
I need to talk to you.
Come here.

18:18.873 --> 18:21.008
No, no, just draw it.

18:21.075 --> 18:25.220
Mr. Ruxin, those witnesses
were an embarrassment.

18:25.340 --> 18:27.710
Most judges would hold you
in contempt for putting that

18:27.830 --> 18:30.348
pedophile up there as
an expert witness.

18:30.468 --> 18:31.973
But you're not one of
those judges, right?

18:32.093 --> 18:34.596
Well, I've learned to be
patient with new dogs.

18:34.716 --> 18:35.307
Okay.

18:35.427 --> 18:38.212
Until they shit on the
carpet one too many times.

18:38.332 --> 18:41.721
Now I want you to beg for my
forgiveness, you dirty dog.

18:42.063 --> 18:43.096
Okay.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.467
See, I thought what we
had was a work flirt.

18:46.587 --> 18:47.178
Do we?

18:47.298 --> 18:50.549
And, uh, I was very comfortable
in the reserves.

18:50.669 --> 18:53.508
And you're being called
up to active duty.

18:53.628 --> 18:54.546
I'm married.

18:54.666 --> 18:58.214
Okay? So I'm not really capable of
doing more than what we were doing.

18:58.334 --> 19:00.264
I could watch you flick it.

19:01.127 --> 19:04.076
I could tug one out, maybe, but...
Are you trying to plea bargain?

19:04.196 --> 19:07.254
- You know, I dressed like a...
- You.

19:12.643 --> 19:13.682
No.

19:16.949 --> 19:19.413
Okay, so, no, um, I don't
want to get married.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.735
Oh, thank God.
I-I am married.

19:21.803 --> 19:23.180
Oh.
Yeah.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.258
He's coming here... my husband.

19:25.378 --> 19:26.485
Why would he want to meet me?

19:26.514 --> 19:27.829
Who's been screwing my wife?!

19:27.949 --> 19:29.428
Okay, sweetie.

19:29.485 --> 19:31.264
Calm down. That's funny.
It's fine.

19:31.384 --> 19:32.397
Who the hell is this?

19:32.517 --> 19:35.075
They're just drawings, sweetie.
They just look like people.

19:35.195 --> 19:37.069
That's this desk!
Maybe.

19:37.189 --> 19:38.285
Who the hell is this?!

19:38.405 --> 19:40.363
I'm not sure.

19:43.124 --> 19:45.377
Ooh, busted.
Hey.

19:45.497 --> 19:47.181
You're a dead man.
Hey, buddy.

19:47.301 --> 19:48.854
Hey, calm down. Listen, listen.

19:48.892 --> 19:50.834
Big misunderstanding, okay?
Nothing happened.

19:50.876 --> 19:52.244
Okay, we just had sex.

19:52.364 --> 19:54.034
You son of a bitch!
Don't!

19:56.646 --> 19:58.942
She's gonna need a lot
more plastic surgery.

19:59.062 --> 20:00.216
Get in early on that.

20:00.336 --> 20:01.956
Bad boy!
Bad dog!

20:01.998 --> 20:03.405
Hi, Judge.
Hi, dog Ruxin.

20:03.461 --> 20:04.819
What?
I got to hide.

20:04.939 --> 20:05.761
Get back here, you little...
Out!

20:05.881 --> 20:07.511
What the...

20:09.134 --> 20:11.023
Out!
Thank God.

20:11.283 --> 20:12.418
Can you help me, please?

20:13.681 --> 20:15.468
Almost there.
Slowing down a little bit.

20:15.536 --> 20:18.040
Sure I can't get you a slice,
maybe an extra Bud Light?

20:18.160 --> 20:19.185
Oh, please, no.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.573
Guys, last bite, last bite.

20:20.641 --> 20:21.973
Last bite.
It's coming.

20:22.829 --> 20:24.332
Come on, come on.

20:25.781 --> 20:28.350
You did it.
Good job, buddy.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.210
Look right over there.
You see that?

20:30.330 --> 20:31.823
You ate that whole thing.

20:31.943 --> 20:33.682
That's floating around
in your tum-tum.

20:33.802 --> 20:35.733
Just a meat, cheese and dough bus.

20:35.853 --> 20:38.262
I don't know how you did that.
I-I could never have eaten the whole thing.

20:38.382 --> 20:39.490
You said you ate it.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.075
No, no, I was just
stealing your thunder.

20:42.416 --> 20:43.409
I'm sorry, what's that?

20:45.079 --> 20:55.256
