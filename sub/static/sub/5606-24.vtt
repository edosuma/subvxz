12:58.311 --> 12:59.310
No.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.579
Huh? You sure?

13:01.581 --> 13:02.814
What are you doing?

13:02.815 --> 13:04.048
Trying to find
the open HPD channel.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.683
(indistinct radio chatter)
Got it.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.086
HPD dispatch.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.754
It's Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett of Five-O.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.957
I need an immediate
patch through

13:12.959 --> 13:13.991
to Captain Lou Grover.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.294
(cell phone beeps)

13:17.296 --> 13:19.063
This is Captain Grover.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.731
DISPATCH:
Captain, I have an emergency

13:20.733 --> 13:22.666
patch-in from
Commander Steve McGarrett.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.068
All right, put him through.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.069
STEVE:
Lou.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.070
McGarrett, what's going on?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.205
We got Gabriel,

13:27.206 --> 13:28.339
but Shioma's people
hit the building

13:28.341 --> 13:30.074
and we're under fire;
we are under fire.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.364
How the hell

13:31.365 --> 13:32.653
does she even know
he was in there?

13:32.654 --> 13:33.942
I don't know.
They've jammed our cells, okay?

13:33.946 --> 13:35.613
I need you to grab SWAT.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.214
Send HPD to our location
right now.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.649
I'm on it.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.083
DANNY: Take at least
ten minutes to get here.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.085
We can't stay in the stairwell,

13:41.087 --> 13:42.119
we're too exposed.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.187
She's right.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.922
We gotta go to the roof.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.159
All right, let's get it, fellas.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.961
Like old times.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.363
SWAT to the rescue.
Let's go, baby.

13:52.365 --> 13:56.734
(sirens honk, then wail)

14:06.212 --> 14:07.277
What are you doing?

14:13.653 --> 14:16.320
Abby, the exfil's
been moved to the roof.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.422
Do you copy?

14:18.424 --> 14:19.957
(over radio): Abby...

14:19.959 --> 14:21.291
Abby, do you copy?

14:22.928 --> 14:24.228
They're on the roof.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.613
TE'O:
Good.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.997
We're on our way.
Hold your position.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.899
Make sure no one
gets out of the building.

14:28.901 --> 14:29.900
What about the girl?

14:29.902 --> 14:31.802
Get rid of her.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.108
Still no word from Abby.
We gotta go back.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.177
I wouldn't worry
too much about her, Chin.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.378
I'm sure she's fine.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.714
Hey, what'd I tell you
about talking?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.832
I'll go back with you, Chin.

14:44.833 --> 14:45.949
I'm not risking
Abby's life for his.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.818
Nobody is.
Nobody is, okay?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.403
But no one's going anywhere.

14:49.404 --> 14:50.987
We gotta stay together.
We gotta stay on this rooftop.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.490
We leave this rooftop,

14:52.491 --> 14:53.991
we lose the only tactical
advantage that we have.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.092
We stick together,

14:55.094 --> 14:57.027
we wait for Grover, all right?

14:57.029 --> 14:58.729
Chin, I promise you,

14:58.731 --> 14:59.997
we're not gonna
leave Abby behind.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.699
All right.
All right?

15:01.701 --> 15:02.766
Grover, you copy?

15:02.768 --> 15:03.734
Yeah, I copy.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.968
What's your ETA?

15:05.771 --> 15:06.870
About five minutes out.

15:06.871 --> 15:07.970
Hang on, we're coming
to get you.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.945
(tires screech)

15:14.947 --> 15:15.379
Oh!

15:17.016 --> 15:18.916
(tires screeching)

15:22.354 --> 15:23.821
(gunfire)

15:36.168 --> 15:37.835
(man groans)

15:42.908 --> 15:44.141
We're taking fire!

15:45.311 --> 15:47.211
Lou.
(gunfire over radio)

15:47.213 --> 15:48.512
Lou!

15:48.513 --> 15:49.812
They had to know
help was coming.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.050
Okay, all right,
we're on our own.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.818
Check in. Ammo report.
What do you got?

15:54.820 --> 15:55.352
Low.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.220
Very, very low.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.204
CHIN:
Same.

15:57.205 --> 15:58.187
FOOT SOLDIER:
Access to the roof

15:58.190 --> 16:00.057
is off the south stairs.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.091
FOOT SOLDIER 2:
Copy.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.226
They know we're up here.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.427
We can't hold them back.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.065
Watch out.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.433
Yeah.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.343
All right.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.377
We're gonna jump.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.545
What'd you just say?

16:21.547 --> 16:22.813
You mean, jump?

16:22.815 --> 16:23.814
STEVE:
We're gonna jump.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.205
What do you mean jump?

16:25.206 --> 16:26.595
We can't jump.
That's ten feet across.

16:26.596 --> 16:27.985
It's the only way
off of this thing.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.354
Besides, this building
is taller than that building.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.156
It's gonna cut the jump by,
like, three feet.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.457
So it's fine. Oh, really?
Oh, really?

16:33.459 --> 16:34.858
Doctor?
Well, I'm not so sure

16:34.860 --> 16:36.059
about your
mathematics, Steve.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.394
Would you trust me,
for once in your life?

16:37.396 --> 16:38.696
Trust you?

16:38.697 --> 16:39.997
Steve, we might be able
to make that jump.

16:39.999 --> 16:40.964
There's no way that he can.

16:40.966 --> 16:41.932
Well, he has to.

16:41.934 --> 16:42.800
I can do it.

16:42.802 --> 16:43.801
Doubtful.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.135
GABRIEL:
Look at it this way,

16:45.137 --> 16:47.171
I come up short, I die.

16:48.974 --> 16:49.973
You get what you want.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.809
I make it...

16:51.811 --> 16:52.810
take me to prison.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.279
You still get what you want.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.217
All right, we got to go.

17:00.219 --> 17:01.418
We got to go right now.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.419
Chin, on me.

17:02.421 --> 17:03.821
Guys, we got to go right now.

17:03.823 --> 17:04.822
Well... hey.
Right now.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.190
Hey! Hey!

17:06.191 --> 17:07.557
How about we
don't commit suicide,

17:07.558 --> 17:08.924
and we stand here and
we shoot all the bad guys

17:08.928 --> 17:10.828
when they come out the door?
How about that?

17:10.830 --> 17:12.563
Oh, yeah, Danny, what about when
your ammo runs out?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.231
What do you got,
four bullets left, huh?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.166
What are you gonna do then?
All right, fine.

17:16.168 --> 17:18.836
Steve, you win,
but I hate it

17:18.838 --> 17:20.470
and it's a stupid idea, okay?

17:20.472 --> 17:23.040
It's a very stupid idea and
you are going to apologize

17:23.042 --> 17:24.575
to all my family members at
my funeral, you understand?

17:24.577 --> 17:25.943
Yeah, no problem.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.377
It'd be a pleasure, okay?

17:27.379 --> 17:28.912
Kono, you and Danny first.
Let's go.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.230
No, you go.
You go first.

17:30.231 --> 17:31.547
It's your stupid idea,
you be the guinea pig.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.616
Danny...
I'll hold the door!

17:32.618 --> 17:33.884
Danny, go.
I don't want to go!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.102
Danny!
Kono!

17:35.103 --> 17:36.319
Go with Danny, I got Gabriel.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.588
I love you, buddy.
Good luck.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.189
I hate you so much.
Go, go.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.524
Pick your shots.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.159
Conserve your ammo.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.126
Copy.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.904
We made it!

17:53.906 --> 17:54.571
Here they come.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.379
I'm going for Gabriel, cover me.

18:02.381 --> 18:03.280
Go.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.222
See you on the other side.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.124
(groans in pain)

18:18.297 --> 18:19.630
(groans loudly)

18:23.035 --> 18:24.234
Gabriel's across.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.535
Go, Chin, go.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.304
(gunfire)

18:30.109 --> 18:31.541
(grunts)

18:31.543 --> 18:33.543
(gunfire continues
in the distance)

18:33.545 --> 18:35.913
(gun clicks)

18:35.915 --> 18:38.448
(gunfire continues)

18:58.704 --> 19:00.570
(grunts)

19:06.946 --> 19:08.011
Go, go!

19:09.048 --> 19:10.113
KONO:
Let's go.

19:31.071 --> 19:33.304
(grunts)

19:33.306 --> 19:34.773
I need more ammo.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.148
(grunts)

19:44.818 --> 19:46.117
Man down!

19:46.119 --> 19:47.418
Move it!

19:47.420 --> 19:49.821
Come on!

19:49.823 --> 19:50.855
I got you.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.023
Cover!

20:03.570 --> 20:05.436
They're gonna be coming.
If we want to find Abby,

20:05.438 --> 20:06.905
we gotta move right now.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.574
Okay, let's go.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.283
Contact front!

20:18.285 --> 20:19.851
Get off the street.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.452
Off the street!
Everybody down!

20:21.454 --> 20:22.871
Five-O!
Get off the street!

20:22.872 --> 20:24.289
Everybody get safe!
Get safe right now!

20:24.291 --> 20:25.557
(people screaming)
Danny...

20:25.559 --> 20:27.025
(mouths words)

20:27.027 --> 20:28.193
One, two...

20:28.195 --> 20:29.260
three.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.363
Move in.

20:37.871 --> 20:39.304
Kono, grab the AK.

20:39.306 --> 20:41.005
You got it.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.073
Got him?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.244
This is Captain Lou Grover.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.913
We got an ambush
at Beretenia and Lisbon.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.949
I need back up now! Now!

20:54.287 --> 20:56.054
STEVE:
Danny, check the Cruze.

20:56.056 --> 20:57.956
Chin, check the dead guy.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.425
You got him? KONO: Yeah.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.093
Get out of here.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.973
Not going anywhere
in the Camaro.

21:14.975 --> 21:17.208
DANNY:
Same here.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.479
Guys...

21:21.481 --> 21:22.547
I got Abby's comm.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.961
(gun clicking)

21:56.283 --> 21:57.348
Get the car.

22:02.022 --> 22:04.122
Hey, you guys did so good.

22:04.124 --> 22:05.640
(phone ringing)

22:05.641 --> 22:07.157
Stay here, Mommy
will be right back, okay?

22:11.698 --> 22:12.697
Is it done?

22:12.699 --> 22:14.198
No, we lost them.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.100
They're somewhere in Chinatown.

22:16.102 --> 22:19.270
But with all the gunfire,
HPD will be here any minute.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.539
We need to stand down.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.441
You stand down,
I won't just kill you,

22:23.443 --> 22:24.442
I'll kill everyone you love,

22:24.444 --> 22:26.544
and I'll do them first,

22:26.545 --> 22:28.645
so you've learned your lesson
before you die.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.281
Reinforcements are on their way.

22:30.283 --> 22:34.118
Forget HPD;
I've taken care of them.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.255
Just make sure
you find Waincroft.

22:58.178 --> 22:59.577
Come on.

23:01.281 --> 23:02.580
His pulse is weak.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.315
Lou, do you read me?

23:04.317 --> 23:05.350
Come in. Lou.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.585
Kono, you get any signal?

23:07.587 --> 23:09.087
There's still no signal.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.588
They must be jamming
the network in the whole area.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.123
All right, this...

23:12.125 --> 23:13.725
is not right, all right?

23:13.727 --> 23:15.393
Even though cell phones
don't work,

23:15.395 --> 23:16.594
HPD would be flooded
with calls right now.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.162
They should be here, huh?

23:18.164 --> 23:20.598
Unless HPD's communications

23:20.600 --> 23:22.433
have been compromised.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.002
KONO;
Maybe Shioma

23:24.004 --> 23:25.203
has someone on the inside,

23:25.205 --> 23:26.571
making sure the calls
don't get through.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.106
Well, that would
explain how they knew

23:28.108 --> 23:30.174
about the 911 call
and Gabriel.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.576
And that Grover and
SWAT are on the way.

23:31.578 --> 23:35.380
There was talk Shioma
had a mole inside HPD.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.682
(coughs)

23:37.684 --> 23:39.150
Guess it was true.

23:39.152 --> 23:41.753
(over radio): Guys, it's Abby.
Do you read me?

23:41.755 --> 23:43.221
Abby.

23:43.223 --> 23:44.589
Hey, where are you?

23:44.591 --> 23:45.690
You okay?

23:45.692 --> 23:46.691
(sighs)

23:46.693 --> 23:47.759
Yeah.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.127
Yeah, I'm with Lou.

23:49.129 --> 23:50.261
We're both okay.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.397
SWAT got hit pretty hard.

23:52.399 --> 23:54.232
How about you guys?
We're fine.

23:54.234 --> 23:55.800
For now.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.367
Are you getting
any cell phone signal?

23:57.370 --> 23:58.369
No, cell is down

23:58.371 --> 23:59.637
in the entire area.

23:59.639 --> 24:00.638
Grover radioed

24:00.640 --> 24:01.806
for HPD backup and an ambulance,

24:01.808 --> 24:03.063
but they haven't shown up yet.

24:03.064 --> 24:04.319
Yeah, well,
they're not gonna show up.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.575
We think that HPD's
been compromised.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.045
Abby, it's Steve.

24:07.047 --> 24:08.346
Listen, I need you

24:08.347 --> 24:09.646
to reach out to Coughlin.
See if he's been

24:09.649 --> 24:12.216
investigating any dirty cops
with ties to Michelle Shioma.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.352
I doubt they'll talk to me,
but I'll give it a try.

24:14.354 --> 24:16.521
Listen, I'm gonna
hand you off to Grover.

24:16.523 --> 24:19.190
I'll keep you posted
if I find out.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.258
GROVER:
You guys...

24:20.260 --> 24:21.392
Lou, hey.
You all right?

24:21.394 --> 24:22.393
Barely.

24:22.395 --> 24:24.128
Abby saved my ass.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.797
Listen, give me your location.
I'm coming to you.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.665
No, forget about it.
We're not sticking around.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.734
You know I'm not gonna
sit this one out, right?

24:29.736 --> 24:31.069
I'm not asking you to.

24:31.071 --> 24:32.503
Listen to me, Lou,

24:32.505 --> 24:34.605
get to a landline, contact Duke

24:34.607 --> 24:36.074
on his cell phone.

24:36.076 --> 24:38.143
Have him mobilize ESU.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.211
But make sure he circumvents the
normal communication channels.

24:40.213 --> 24:41.679
Okay.
What are you gonna do?

24:41.681 --> 24:42.814
I'm gonna find some
transportation

24:42.816 --> 24:44.248
and get Gabriel to a hospital.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.900
All right, fine.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.551
Two words you
never listen to, ever:

24:47.554 --> 24:48.686
Be careful.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.238
Yeah.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.789
Transportation, that's,
that's a fantastic plan.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.157
What about
the Yakuza death squad

24:53.159 --> 24:54.292
that's outside waiting for us?

24:54.294 --> 24:55.693
How are we gonna
get through them?

24:55.695 --> 24:57.595
I'm still working on that.
Oh.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.796
He's working on it.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.633
STEVE:
Jerry, we good to go?

25:02.635 --> 25:04.402
Yup.

25:04.403 --> 25:06.170
Navy Intel just patched me into
their Titan 4D satellite,

25:06.172 --> 25:07.171
and FYI,

25:07.173 --> 25:08.172
it's totally awesome.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.474
All right, Jerry,

25:09.476 --> 25:10.475
did you make sure
that we are communicating

25:10.477 --> 25:11.709
on the secure channel?

25:11.711 --> 25:13.444
Please, I've been working
radio frequencies

25:13.446 --> 25:15.113
since I was six.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.781
High chatter routes,
from Honolulu to Roswell,

25:16.783 --> 25:19.450
so trust me when I tell you that
the president himself

25:19.452 --> 25:21.219
couldn't listen in on our comms.

25:21.221 --> 25:22.420
Okay, good.

25:22.421 --> 25:23.620
Then get us
the hell out of here.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.189
On it.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.324
Okay,

25:26.326 --> 25:28.259
according to the
architectural blueprints

25:28.261 --> 25:30.011
of the Hawaii Theatre,

25:30.012 --> 25:31.762
there should be a door near
the back right of the stage.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.197
That is your egress point.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.198
I got it.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.700
Get him up.
We're out of here.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.835
Let's go.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.374
JERRY (over radio):
Head down the alley

25:43.376 --> 25:44.408
Hang a right.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.743
Should be a lot of traffic.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.478
Jerry, where is everyone?

25:47.480 --> 25:50.148
Uh, Max, now's
not a real good time.

25:50.150 --> 25:52.216
I'm helping the Five-O navigate
the streets of Chinatown

25:52.218 --> 25:54.552
so they don't killed
by a bunch of Yakuza madmen.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.154
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

25:56.155 --> 25:57.755
Not unless you have
an AK-47 and a jet pack.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.191
Unfortunately, I do not have
either of those items.

26:05.532 --> 26:06.681
JERRY (over radio):
Hey, guys,

26:06.682 --> 26:07.831
we got two bogeys
coming in your direction

26:07.834 --> 26:09.367
from the alley up ahead.

26:18.545 --> 26:19.911
<i> Call of Duty,</i> my ass.

26:19.913 --> 26:21.212
Good work, Jerry.

26:21.214 --> 26:22.780
Oh, shh!
Red alert!

26:22.782 --> 26:24.715
Two SUVs just pulled away,
headed in your direction.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.784
We got to get off this street.
Jerry, now what?

26:26.786 --> 26:28.286
If you cut across
that parking structure,

26:28.288 --> 26:29.720
there's a bus
about to make a stop.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.222
You can catch it if you run.

26:31.224 --> 26:32.456
Let's go.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.658
Let's go. Go, go, go!

26:35.962 --> 26:37.261
STEVE:
Stop! Stop!

26:38.665 --> 26:39.830
Hey! Hey!

26:39.832 --> 26:41.632
Five-O! Five-O!

26:41.634 --> 26:44.402
Hey, stop.

26:44.404 --> 26:45.536
We need your bus.

26:47.507 --> 26:50.608
You know I have,
uh, experience driving

26:50.610 --> 26:52.376
one of these, right?
Yeah, yeah.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.544
On a highway in the
middle of nowhere.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.812
City driving is a
different animal.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.681
Different.
Unbelievable.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.282
Hey, Jerry,
I need a 20 on those SUVs.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.450
Three blocks and closing.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.889
Two blocks.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.557
(engine revving)

27:09.796 --> 27:11.362
Steve?

27:11.364 --> 27:13.864
Yeah, I got 'em
I see them.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.305
KONO: You think they
know we're on the bus?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.873
(tires screeching)
DANNY: I think so.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.813
Guys, get down and brace!

27:31.251 --> 27:32.783
Get down and brace now!

27:58.645 --> 28:00.278
Great driving.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.712
Guys, they're coming towards
you! Get out of there now.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.201
Chin!

28:06.202 --> 28:07.652
Get Gabriel to
the rear doors.

28:07.654 --> 28:09.420
Let's move!
Let's move!

28:14.460 --> 28:15.860
You got two bogeys
approaching from the rear.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.061
Kono, handle it!

28:17.063 --> 28:18.562
Yeah, got it.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.536
GROVER:
Save your ammo, sister.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.537
I got 'em.

28:26.539 --> 28:27.805
(groans)

28:27.807 --> 28:28.906
Yeah!

28:30.576 --> 28:31.942
I told you
I wasn't sitting this one out.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.444
Nice timing, Lou.

28:33.446 --> 28:34.945
GROVER:
I finally got a hold of Duke.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.682
RDF is on their way
to SWAT's location.

28:37.684 --> 28:39.684
They're stuck about
ten blocks from here

28:39.686 --> 28:41.085
at Beretenia and Lisbon.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.653
Chin, this
alleyway on the right,

28:42.655 --> 28:44.088
that's our alley, okay?

28:44.090 --> 28:45.690
Take Gabriel up there.
We'll cover you.

28:45.692 --> 28:46.590
What about you guys?

28:46.592 --> 28:48.042
We're gonna catch up.

28:48.043 --> 28:49.493
We all move up
that alley at once,

28:49.495 --> 28:50.494
we're easy targets.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.562
Copy.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.365
You ready?

28:54.367 --> 28:55.866
Does it matter?

28:55.868 --> 28:57.151
Be careful.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.435
GROVER:
Come on, Chin, I got you.

28:59.372 --> 29:01.939
One, two... three, go!

29:05.445 --> 29:06.744
(men grunting)

29:17.957 --> 29:20.858
(Gabriel coughing, gasping)

29:20.860 --> 29:22.360
Jerry, you there?

29:22.362 --> 29:23.661
Like Al in<i> Die Hard,</i> buddy.

29:23.663 --> 29:25.062
Just hang a left

29:25.064 --> 29:26.564
on Fort Street Mall
and head toward Beretenia.

29:26.566 --> 29:27.965
(groaning)

29:27.967 --> 29:29.567
Path's all clear.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.776
My office said you
needed to see me.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.411
You got five minutes.

29:40.413 --> 29:43.914
We think Michelle Shioma
has a mole inside HPD.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.816
I need to know if you're looking
at anyone connected to her.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.385
So it's "we" now?

29:47.387 --> 29:48.886
I sent you in there

29:48.888 --> 29:50.421
to help me take them down, Abby,

29:50.423 --> 29:51.822
not become one of them.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.157
We have Gabriel Waincroft
in custody.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.526
Five-O was extracting him,
when Shioma

29:55.528 --> 29:57.528
sent in a team
to assassinate him.

29:57.530 --> 29:59.497
They're literally
under attack, as we speak.

29:59.499 --> 30:00.831
What the hell are
you doing here?

30:00.833 --> 30:02.633
Trying to save my friends.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.568
Whoever Shioma has

30:04.570 --> 30:06.504
inside HPD is blocking
communication,

30:06.506 --> 30:07.772
so we can't call for backup

30:07.774 --> 30:09.140
because we don't know
who we can trust.

30:09.142 --> 30:10.908
That's why I need your help.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.445
Robert...

30:14.447 --> 30:17.448
if you ever want to see
Waincroft stand trial

30:17.450 --> 30:19.950
for the murder of your brother,
you'll get me a name.

30:21.154 --> 30:23.988
Give me a half hour to
cross-reference all my cases.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.724
If Shioma's got someone on the
inside, I'll find them for you.

30:26.726 --> 30:28.726
Thank you.

30:36.903 --> 30:39.437
(coughs)

30:39.439 --> 30:40.438
I'm not gonna make it.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.207
Get up. Get up!

30:43.209 --> 30:44.708
You're making it
to the hospital,

30:44.710 --> 30:46.477
if I have to drag
you there myself.

30:49.215 --> 30:52.049
Don't turn right.
Don't turn right.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.684
They turned right.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.686
JERRY:
Thanks, Max. I can see that.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.621
Chin, you got a bogey
heading your direction.

30:57.623 --> 30:58.823
Gotta get off the street.

30:58.825 --> 31:00.825
Like, now.
Okay.

31:00.827 --> 31:02.460
Any thoughts on that, Jer?

31:02.462 --> 31:03.694
I'm working on it.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.162
Okay, there's
an apartment building

31:05.164 --> 31:06.697
across the street.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.165
Glass doors, gold trim.
You see it?

31:09.769 --> 31:11.686
Got it.

31:11.687 --> 31:13.604
Call box code's
on file with the city: 3149.

31:13.606 --> 31:14.705
Copy.

31:14.707 --> 31:15.773
Come on.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.111
You still on her?

31:21.113 --> 31:22.513
LUKELA:
Yes.

31:22.515 --> 31:23.581
She just got home.

31:23.583 --> 31:25.115
Call me if she leaves.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.684
Will do.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.466
Yeah, who is it?

31:42.467 --> 31:44.133
Sir, my name is Lieutenant
Chin Ho Kelly. I'm with Five-O.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.536
This man has been shot.

31:45.538 --> 31:46.804
He needs medical attention.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.774
Sir, it's okay.

31:49.775 --> 31:50.875
I'm with Five-O.
Please go back

31:50.877 --> 31:52.710
inside your home.

31:56.282 --> 31:57.932
What's the latest?

31:57.933 --> 31:59.583
JERRY: Chin and Gabriel are holed
up in an apartment building.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.885
Shioma's men don't know
where they are.

32:00.887 --> 32:02.119
What about
everyone else?

32:02.121 --> 32:03.187
Well, someone gave them
bad advice

32:03.189 --> 32:04.655
about boarding a bus.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.090
JERRY: Yeah, but it's
not important who.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.658
Okay, it was me.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.225
But you see the dead
bodies all around it? We won.

32:11.898 --> 32:14.698
Well, I guess Shioma's gonna
need some more bad guys.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.800
STEVE: This car's basically
undriveable.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.035
This one, too.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.571
Jerry, how far is
that apartment?

32:20.573 --> 32:21.572
Half a mile.

32:21.574 --> 32:23.641
Half a mile...

32:23.643 --> 32:24.708
Let's go.

32:29.582 --> 32:31.248
You're wasting your time.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.751
Get it through your head:
you're not dying today.

32:49.001 --> 32:50.701
You son of a bitch.

32:50.703 --> 32:53.270
Please...

32:58.244 --> 32:59.343
Damn it.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.744
Max, are you there?

33:01.213 --> 33:02.580
Yes, Lieutenant.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.948
Max, I can't stop the bleeding.

33:03.950 --> 33:05.316
Well, I suggest you
cauterize the wound.

33:05.318 --> 33:06.650
Yeah, how do I do that?

33:06.652 --> 33:07.952
Ambroise Paré,

33:07.954 --> 33:09.219
the French
barber surgeon,

33:09.221 --> 33:12.056
who was a pioneer in
battlefield medicine,

33:12.058 --> 33:13.958
used to cauterize wounds
with gunpowder.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.125
Okay, how much do I need?

33:15.127 --> 33:16.126
How big is the wound?

33:16.128 --> 33:17.211
About an inch.

33:17.212 --> 33:18.295
Half a round should suffice.

33:18.931 --> 33:19.930
Uh, Jesse, right?

33:19.932 --> 33:20.998
Yes.
Jesse, I need

33:21.000 --> 33:22.333
uh, uh, a pair
of pliers and

33:22.335 --> 33:23.367
a-a box of wooden
matches, okay?

33:23.369 --> 33:24.635
Coming right up.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.938
I can't go to jail.

Chin...

33:31.744 --> 33:34.178
I'm sorry about your father.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.785
I need you to do
something for me, Chin.

33:43.356 --> 33:46.323
I need you to look after Sara.

33:48.995 --> 33:51.729
I know that you saved her,

33:51.731 --> 33:53.130
and I know what
happened to Vanessa.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.232
If you knew
what happened to her,

33:55.234 --> 33:56.300
then why didn't you ever
see your daughter?

33:56.302 --> 33:57.868
Because I knew you

33:57.870 --> 33:59.670
would've been waiting for me.

34:01.841 --> 34:04.808
(breathing heavily)

You know...

34:08.147 --> 34:10.881

34:11.851 --> 34:13.817
Yeah.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.122
Don't do it for me, Chin...

34:18.124 --> 34:19.990
do it for my sister.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.094
Malia would have
been Sara's aunt.

Hey, Chin,

35:18.317 --> 35:19.617
that SUV from earlier

35:19.618 --> 35:20.918
just did a loop
around the block

35:20.920 --> 35:22.119
and stopped outside
your location.

35:39.105 --> 35:40.437
They're close.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.940
How far away is McGarrett?

35:42.942 --> 35:44.475
Three blocks.

35:44.477 --> 35:45.509

35:58.424 --> 35:59.523
