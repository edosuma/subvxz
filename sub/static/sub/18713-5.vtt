This programme some scenes which
some viewers may find upsetting

00:29.235 --> 00:30.305
Ow!

00:58.600 --> 01:01.240
No, I'm really not happy with
the arrangements for this evening.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.319
Couple of things.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.680
You say you can fit an extra
ten people in the alcove

01:06.720 --> 01:09.759
by the window, but I've seen
that alcove, and, with respect,

01:09.760 --> 01:12.360
a romantic meal for two
would be a squeeze.

01:13.300 --> 01:17.300
It's my sister's baby shower and
I need everything to be perfect.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.514
Listen, I'm coming over now.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.593
To show you how
the seating can work.

01:27.443 --> 01:30.080
Honestly, it's no trouble.
See you in a minute.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.720
'999, emergency...'

03:24.640 --> 03:27.679
DCI Andy Steemson.
This is DS Karen Wretzky.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.117
Nikki Alexander, pathologist.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.719
Jack Hodgson, forensics.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.120
I know what you're thinking.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.760
It's only been 24 hours
since Lucy disappeared,

03:34.800 --> 03:37.000
but there's something
we're keeping under wraps.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.847
We got a one-second 999 call
from her mobile at 9.23am.

03:41.872 --> 03:44.799
Nothing audible. Well, it should
help with the location at least.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.359
Only picked up on the one mast.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
So we can't triangulate. No.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.879
Traces of what looks like blood and
maybe fingerprints were found here -

03:52.880 --> 03:55.080
the samples are on their way to you.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.120
Of course, it's still possible that
she walked off into the sunset,

03:58.160 --> 04:01.360
but I want to rule out that she was
taken by force from this location.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.040
I also want to rule out
that she's in this location.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.279
OK.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.760
Let me spell it out.
A missing girl. A big search party.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.080
A media circus.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.280
Couple of days later, the body
shows up in her home,

04:11.320 --> 04:13.960
in the attic or cellar, usually.
It's been there all the time.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.800
That's not going to happen
on my watch.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.279
You want a forensic guarantee

04:17.320 --> 04:19.040
there's not a dead body
on the premises...

04:19.079 --> 04:20.478
basically?

04:20.480 --> 04:22.079
Basically, yeah.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.560
Fine. Then we'll need
the run of the house.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.640
OK.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.200
He grows on you.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.440
I look forward to it.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.258
Getting that burnt smell?

04:38.283 --> 04:39.283
Mm.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.239
This is a big place
for a primary school teacher.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.240
Hm.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.940
I'm thinking family money.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.880
Got some bike treads here.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.280
No bike.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
Jack?

05:48.760 --> 05:50.359
What is that?

05:50.360 --> 05:53.440
I think it was... a cake.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.280
Who bakes a cake then disappears
into the sunset?

06:14.840 --> 06:16.799
Haven't you got a rehearsal?

06:16.800 --> 06:18.480
No.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.880
Want me to run you in?

06:21.400 --> 06:23.079
No.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.160
Someone got a hangover
by any chance?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.440
No.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.199
You've got two minutes.
I'll make toast to go.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.519
Dad, I've got four lines.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.880
I don't want to spend my Sunday
waiting to say them. Please!

06:37.920 --> 06:39.600
Mum won't be happy.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.040
Mum's not going to remember
unless you tell her.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.280
Wow. They're searching the lane.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.280
Think they've found her?

06:53.320 --> 06:57.280
No idea. Tell you what, though,
forget about the rehearsal.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.840
Dad, I can look after myself.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.760
Fair enough. Off you go, then.

08:22.640 --> 08:27.079
I found a cycling app on Lucy's
laptop - it uploaded automatically

08:27.080 --> 08:31.640
and tells us she cycled 3.75 miles
on the morning she vanished.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.440
What time was it activated?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.999
Um, 9.10.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.639
So, she triggered the program
as she left her house...

08:37.640 --> 08:39.039
I'm ahead of you.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.198
Sorry.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.480
Traffic cams on the main road

08:41.520 --> 08:45.719
were checked for the morning
she went missing. No sightings? No.

08:45.720 --> 08:50.200
Leaving five
surrounding lanes and a B-road.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.280
We've got something - bang
on 3.75 miles from her house.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.759
'We believe Lucy left her home
in Felking, Surrey, at around 9am

09:37.760 --> 09:40.760
'on Saturday morning and that she
was riding

09:40.800 --> 09:42.959
'the bike in this photograph.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.160
'Did anyone see her
in that area at that time?

09:46.200 --> 09:51.320
'Whoever's taken my sister, Lucy
is a good person to her bones.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.520
'She'd help anyone in any situation,

09:53.560 --> 09:58.640
'and I want her back.
I NEED her back.'

10:02.760 --> 10:04.360
Hello.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.840
All right, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.119
Hiya. Thomas Chamberlain.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.960
DS Steele. Maureen to my friends.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.000
Right.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.640
She's got track marks on both arms.
Looks like a user.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.080
Just saying.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.200
Ah! I used to have one of them!

10:59.240 --> 11:01.240
I couldn't get those
little tapes any more.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.479
Bloke on Tottenham Court Road
still sells them.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.080
Yeah? When we're done,
give me his details, would you?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.320
Gladly.

11:07.360 --> 11:12.480
Victim is female, no apparent ID,
and is lying on her back.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.640
There's a single,
penetrating wound to her chest,

11:14.680 --> 11:17.759
dusting of fine white powder
to her tracksuit.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.320
Got to be coke, right?

11:19.360 --> 11:23.560
Well, yes... or talcum powder.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.120
Either way, she's not a primary
school teacher, that's for sure.

11:28.160 --> 11:32.320
What is it with bank holiday
weekends and girls going missing?

11:32.360 --> 11:34.560
I blame the tabloids myself.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.800
Check for a planar distribution
of any injuries in case she fell

11:37.840 --> 11:40.240
or was thrown from the road above.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.480
Who called this in?

11:43.520 --> 11:47.199
Council engineer.
Routine checks on the bridge struts.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.160
He was getting back into his van
when, thank God, he found the body.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.160
If she was dumped from up there,

11:55.200 --> 11:58.520
killer's on camera one side
of the bridge or the other.

11:58.560 --> 12:02.360
Well, I'll get on with
the postmortem, if that suits.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.799
Before you do, do me a favour?

12:03.800 --> 12:05.000
What?

12:05.040 --> 12:06.439
Run her prints.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.720
If she hasn't got a record
a mile long, I'll take it all back.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.000
Bike gets dragged under the car...

12:22.600 --> 12:25.720
Paint's a visual match
to Lucy's bike -

12:25.760 --> 12:27.840
manufacturer will confirm that.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.840
Now we know the road she took,
we can do targeted house-to-house...

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
Strand of hair!

12:51.880 --> 12:54.919
Must've hit her at speed to send her
off the road at this height.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.240
Brake marks on the
asphalt back that up.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.440
Bastard.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.480
Tread prints?

13:00.480 --> 13:01.480
Jack?

13:01.520 --> 13:05.400
We'll see, but when wheels lock up,
all you tend to get is burnt rubber.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.680
We need to search these woods now
in case she came round and wandered off.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.519
What, you're not hopeful?

13:18.520 --> 13:20.199
That velocity and impact - no.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.280
Given that her bike
and phone are missing,

13:22.320 --> 13:25.480
it's more likely the assailant
removed her body from the scene.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.560
You'll be pleased to know
you were entirely correct.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.239
About our victim?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.840
Mm-hm. Tina Lunt, 32.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.480
Long record for theft and
possession - coke and cannabis -

14:07.520 --> 14:09.999
nothing for a couple of years,
though.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.920
She's listed as divorced,
ten-year-old son.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.560
Jack, I need you to check out
the white powder on this tracksuit.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.240
Sure. Just leave it on my desk.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.919
Right. When do you think you might
get round to it?

14:24.920 --> 14:28.920
Er, this afternoon, the earliest.
Might need a gentle nudge.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.240
Count on it.

14:32.080 --> 14:37.399
Although both arms bear scars
suggestive of needle-use,

14:37.400 --> 14:42.440
the marks are old -
months, possibly years -

14:42.480 --> 14:45.440
no evidence of recent activity.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.880
Maybe she was smoking it?

14:47.920 --> 14:49.840
Yeah,
why don't we see what tox says?

14:52.040 --> 14:56.240
There's some kind of metal object
embedded in her chest.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.760
Can you see?

14:57.800 --> 14:59.520
Oh.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.520
Clean, neat entry wound. Right.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.640
Let's have a look at it.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.320
My God.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.520
It's a fork screwdriver.

15:27.720 --> 15:31.160
The tip of the screwdriver has been
bent at a 45-degree angle.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
The metal is discoloured
with a mottled sheen,

15:33.240 --> 15:35.319
suggesting it's been heated
and recast.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.920
There's also, can you see,
crisscross markings on the shaft,

15:38.960 --> 15:41.520
possibly from being
clamped in a vice.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.800
Wow.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.280
You see these plastic flakes
in the wound?

15:50.320 --> 15:53.879
Yeah. She was stabbed with such
force, the handle broke clean off.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.159
That's unusual?

15:55.160 --> 15:58.200
Very. Tool handles are made with
cellulose acetate -

15:58.240 --> 16:00.440
noted for its extreme durability.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.919
All of which suggests
it was done deliberately.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.520
And that couldn't have bent
when it struck her sternum?

16:06.560 --> 16:07.560
No.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.320
So, what kind of person needs to
modify the end of a screwdriver?

16:15.160 --> 16:19.199
Did you see or hear anything unusual
yesterday morning?

16:19.200 --> 16:21.360
Car alarm.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.200
That's right. My car alarm went off.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.040
I didn't hear it because
our bedroom faces the back.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.760
And you sleep like a donkey.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.080
That, too. Yep.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.479
It woke you up, though?

16:32.480 --> 16:34.360
I went out and checked on the car.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.600
Nothing suspicious - no indication
why it'd gone off.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.440
Has that happened before?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.479
Once or twice. Not lately.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.320
I just turned it off.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.760
What time was that?
When you were out on the drive?

16:47.800 --> 16:50.200
It was about nine, I think.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.840
Maybe a bit after.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.839
Mr Timpson, that's exactly when we
think Lucy cycled past on the lane.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.720
You're sure you didn't see her?

16:56.760 --> 16:57.959
Positive.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.120
What about a vehicle?

17:00.440 --> 17:05.440
I'm sorry. I just shut off
the alarm, went back to bed.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.079
It was my day off.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.559
What do you do?

17:08.560 --> 17:09.880
I'm a GP.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.119
You're married?

17:12.160 --> 17:14.560
My wife's in her study
if you need to speak to her.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.638
Was she around Saturday morning?

17:16.640 --> 17:18.000
She was asleep next to me.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.800
I saw someone this morning
in the lane...

17:22.839 --> 17:24.479
big guy in his 30s.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.560
He was weird.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.760
He pulled up across the road,
just staring at the house.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
When he saw me, he drove off.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.480
Do you remember what kind
of car? The colour?

17:33.520 --> 17:38.160
Golf... Fiesta? That kind of thing.
Black or navy.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.200
You definitely didn't recognise him?

17:41.240 --> 17:42.400
Why?

17:42.440 --> 17:43.839
Guess I'm just wondering

17:43.840 --> 17:46.440
whether he was watching the house
or watching you.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.960
Good, we got the CT scan back.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.399
Seems the shaft made an upward,
diagonally-oriented chest wound,

17:58.400 --> 18:02.560
penetrated the pleural cavity here
and was cause of death.

18:08.241 --> 18:09.720
I don't get it.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.748
It must've gone through the flesh
with massive force

18:12.788 --> 18:15.272
not to tear the surrounding skin...

18:15.435 --> 18:18.850
See these fragments of bone?
Smashed right through her sternum.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.239
So, what, we're looking for
a body-builder? A giant?

18:22.576 --> 18:26.016
Maybe to the former,
no to the latter.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.679
If you were going to stab me
with a screwdriver, DS Steele,

18:30.680 --> 18:32.399
how would you do it?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.239
Go on, show me.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.719
Yeah, classic stabbing movement.
Downward arc.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.719
But a downward arc
yields a downward wound tract.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.720
What, and we've got the opposite?

18:41.760 --> 18:45.399
Yeah. Upward trajectory - so either
our killer is three foot tall

18:45.400 --> 18:48.199
or they stabbed her from some kind
of lowered position,

18:48.200 --> 18:50.640
but that would've resulted in a far
messier entry wound.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.200
Clarissa?

18:54.240 --> 18:57.640
Tox is back on Tina Lunt -
clean for drugs and alcohol.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.360
Fancy a trip to her flat
in Hounslow?

19:21.800 --> 19:23.920
Oh. OK. Thanks.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.439
Bad news?

19:26.440 --> 19:28.440
No traffic cams on the bridge.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.119
Nearest one is the other side
of a six-outlet roundabout.

19:32.120 --> 19:35.040
Oh, so, no way of telling which
vehicles went over the bridge?

19:35.080 --> 19:38.400
And they whine about us being
the CCTV capital of the world...

19:43.720 --> 19:46.439
Oh, hang on. We should get uniforms
to sweep, shouldn't we?

19:46.440 --> 19:48.360
Oh, sod that.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.800
Hello?

19:53.880 --> 19:55.000
Oh...

20:19.200 --> 20:20.440
Jesus! You all right?

20:20.480 --> 20:21.480
Yes. Go on!

21:13.880 --> 21:14.880
Oh!

21:16.520 --> 21:18.280
Did you get his registration
number?

21:21.400 --> 21:23.840
If you remember anything else,
please call us.

21:23.880 --> 21:24.880
Thank you.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That was the police.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.040
I heard.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.080
Why did you have to tell them about
the bloody car alarm?

21:52.400 --> 21:55.920
When you turned the alarm off,
was Alec's Land Rover outside?

21:55.960 --> 21:57.759
You're getting in a state
about nothing.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.880
Was it parked outside?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.439
No, I don't think so.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.719
But that doesn't mean much.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.999
He always parks beside the
guesthouse,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.400
and you can't see back there
from the drive.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.719
Find anything?

22:43.720 --> 22:47.240
Five empty beer bottles. No alcohol
in Tina's blood, remember.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.600
Could be our runner's?

22:48.640 --> 22:53.239
Yeah. What do you think?
Came back here to clean up?

22:53.240 --> 22:55.040
No sign of a mobile?

22:55.080 --> 22:56.200
No.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.160
Empty, but still a mess.
Bit like my place.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.600
DS Steele.

23:44.640 --> 23:49.240
Same crisscross markings as the one
I extracted from Tina's chest.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.359
What was she into?

23:51.360 --> 23:54.079
Something tells me our runner
might've had an inkling.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.760
All right. Don't rub it in.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.599
Christ.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.760
It's probably been like this
for days.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.400
Sell-by date tomorrow.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.600
So?

24:26.040 --> 24:28.080
So, it means he could've
been here on Friday night.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.439
Ellie...

24:29.440 --> 24:32.680
Like you said, we wouldn't know.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.120
OK, so he was here on Friday night?
So what?

24:38.760 --> 24:40.799
What are you worried about?

24:40.800 --> 24:42.640
I don't know.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.920
You can't think Alec's
got anything to do with this girl?

24:46.960 --> 24:48.960
No!

24:49.000 --> 24:50.760
No, of course not.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.600
So...?

24:52.640 --> 24:55.480
It doesn't matter what I think.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.599
If they find out about Alec,
they'll...

24:58.600 --> 25:01.480
They'll be all over him like a rash.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.440
He won't survive it, not again.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.840
Isn't this a bit excessive?

25:45.080 --> 25:46.680
I hope so.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.159
What's going on?

25:51.160 --> 25:52.999
Just having a bit of a clear-out.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
That's Alec's coat.
Why are you chucking it out?

25:56.040 --> 25:57.600
It's falling apart.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.679
It's his coat.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.960
Jessica, please, what do you want?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.680
I'm sure your brother
can look after himself.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.959
Can he?

26:16.960 --> 26:18.640
I'm not so sure.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.200
Is that dope?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.999
I thought the first rule of Alec
using the guesthouse was no guests,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.440
female or otherwise?

26:53.520 --> 26:55.000
Jessica.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.359
What?

26:56.360 --> 26:57.799
How do you know?

26:57.800 --> 27:01.000
It's my lipstick.
She's always borrowing it.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.040
I'll talk to Jess.
I'm better at that stuff than you.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.920
It's not her I'm angry with.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.160
'Please leave a message after the tone.'

27:36.200 --> 27:41.440
Alec, listen, it's very important that you
don't use the guesthouse for a bit.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.599
Don't even come to the house.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.600
Um... I'll explain
when I speak to you.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.920
Jessica?

28:02.960 --> 28:05.959
Jessica, are you OK?

28:05.960 --> 28:08.040
Yeah. Sorry. I'll turn around.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.240
OK.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.280
Just finishing up here, sir. Yep...

28:18.760 --> 28:20.240
Hey! Watch out!

28:30.600 --> 28:32.159
Are you all right?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.040
No, I'm fine. Yep, sorry.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.400
Ah!

33:34.080 --> 33:35.360
You didn't call me back.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.999
Want a drink or something?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.560
No, no, I'm fine.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.919
You got my message?

34:01.920 --> 34:03.280
Yes.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.760
Some girl has gone missing?

34:06.800 --> 34:12.079
Just down the road from us.
All things considered, I...

34:12.080 --> 34:14.280
I think it would be best if you...

34:14.320 --> 34:16.320
What? If I... If I stayed away?

34:17.360 --> 34:20.799
Of course. Fine. I'll stay away.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.560
OK.

34:27.760 --> 34:31.559
Last week, which night did you
stay at the guesthouse?

34:31.560 --> 34:37.840
Um... Tuesday, Wednesday I was
panelling at the golf club...

34:39.920 --> 34:42.239
..er... Thursday night.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.320
Not Friday night?

34:43.360 --> 34:44.560
Why are you asking?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.759
The girl went missing
on Saturday morning.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.239
If they found out that you
were in the area...

34:52.480 --> 34:54.918
..we all know how quickly
they jump to conclusions.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.520
What about you, Ellie?

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
Are you jumping to any conclusions?

34:58.600 --> 35:00.199
That is not fair, Alec.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.834
But it's true.

35:01.859 --> 35:05.045
Back then, do you think
that I would've lied for you?

35:05.070 --> 35:09.123
Do you think I would have given you
an alibi if I'd had any doubts whatsoever?

35:12.040 --> 35:13.360
I'm sorry.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.840
Thanks.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.640
Lucy has a swallow tattoo
on her left wrist.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.960
No visible decomposition. She
can't have been in the water long.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.439
You think he dumped her today?

36:52.440 --> 36:54.240
I'd say in the last two
to four hours.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.360
He's confident.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.119
I swabbed the tool kit -
multiple prints and DNA samples,

37:05.120 --> 37:06.679
mostly belonging to Tina herself.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.000
What about the lager bottles?

37:08.025 --> 37:10.258
Well, again, multiple prints and DNA,

37:10.305 --> 37:14.212
but only one overlapping with
the samples from the tool kit.

37:14.619 --> 37:18.608
Belonging to a Wesley Beale.

37:18.633 --> 37:20.840
His CV reads like
a criminal decathlon.

37:20.865 --> 37:22.984
That's him. That's the man I chased.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.559
You chased someone?

37:24.560 --> 37:25.606
Yeah.

37:25.631 --> 37:27.151
Is there CCTV?

37:27.895 --> 37:30.920
What have we got - blackmail,
housebreaking, drug dealing...

37:30.960 --> 37:33.159
And that's just the shit
we nicked him for.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.119
Current address? Er, no,

37:35.120 --> 37:38.640
but last time he was arrested,
he gave Maconi's car mechanics

37:38.680 --> 37:41.159
in Hounslow as his place of
employment.

37:41.160 --> 37:45.279
Owner Marc Maconi nicked
but not charged back in '04

37:45.280 --> 37:48.399
for stealing stereos and airbags.

37:48.400 --> 37:52.520
Off-limits, I'm afraid -
as he didn't do it.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.280
Weasley Beale worked here, right?

37:56.320 --> 37:58.720
About two years ago. So what?

37:58.760 --> 38:00.360
When did you last see him?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.400
We didn't stay in touch.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.479
Aww, did you and Wesley
have a falling out(?)

38:07.480 --> 38:10.920
After he got busted, you lot
turned this place over for days.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.760
And that was a cause
for concern, was it?

38:13.800 --> 38:17.480
Loss of trade was my concern,
nothing else.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.880
So, do you know where we might
find Wesley? No.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.360
Oi! What, you lost or something?

39:22.440 --> 39:24.600
Need a warrant to be
nosing about in here.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.749
You got one?

39:25.796 --> 39:29.120
No. Well, it's trespassing,
then, innit?

39:29.160 --> 39:30.960
And if you're trespassing...

39:31.000 --> 39:32.919
If I'm trespassing, what?

39:32.920 --> 39:35.440
Then the law's on my side.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.320
Wouldn't bet on it, mate.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.240
Let's go.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.199
What was that about?

39:48.200 --> 39:49.600
You get anything on Beale?

39:49.640 --> 39:50.840
Nope.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.319
Thomas.

39:56.320 --> 40:00.160
Jack. Have you checked out the
white powder on that tracksuit?

40:00.200 --> 40:02.800
Sorry, haven't got to it yet.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.319
Right.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.319
I did say you might need
to nudge me.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.320
Yeah, well, consider this a nudge.
First and last.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.360
He hung up on me!

40:22.880 --> 40:25.800
There's a deep ligature
wound to the throat.

40:27.543 --> 40:31.910
Skin damage has released a serum that's
dried out in patches in a parchment effect -

40:31.935 --> 40:35.074
that could be consistent
with death by strangulation.

40:35.498 --> 40:38.992
Left earlobe's torn - a wound
often caused by a snagged earring.

40:39.055 --> 40:41.599
Could've happened
when she came off the bike?

40:41.600 --> 40:47.640
Hm, scabbing over the wound suggests it was
sustained at least a week ago - maybe longer.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.560
We'll ask her sister about it.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.200
A clump of her hair's been cut off.

41:01.531 --> 41:02.811
Trophy?

41:37.720 --> 41:43.782
The lack of lividity and general decomposition
suggests she died between 12 and 24 hours ago.

41:44.880 --> 41:47.520
So, where was he keeping her
since Saturday morning?

41:51.760 --> 41:56.680
Two distinct injuries to the skull.
One, here -

41:56.720 --> 41:58.440
to the side...

42:02.320 --> 42:08.040
..where we can see bark
embedded in the flesh.

42:09.200 --> 42:12.040
This one's partially healed.

42:12.080 --> 42:16.080
Well, that makes sense - we know she
didn't die when he ran her down.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.840
Second head injury...

42:21.400 --> 42:23.800
..right on the back of the skull.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.600
Unhealed.

42:29.720 --> 42:34.680
And there's what look like
cement chips in this wound.

42:34.720 --> 42:38.440
So, he hits her head against a wall?
The floor?

42:38.480 --> 42:43.320
And with massive force - it staved
in the rear of her skull.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.440
Death would've been
almost instantaneous.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.800
So, what killed her? The ligature
wound or the smashed skull?

42:48.840 --> 42:50.800
I don't know.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.120
Yet.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.840
So, given the victim's criminal
history, I thought I'd start

43:18.880 --> 43:21.400
with a wet chemistry test
to see if the powder was cocaine.

43:21.440 --> 43:22.520
Negative? Negative.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.920
So, I spun it down in this guy,
checked it under the scope.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.399
It's cornstarch.

43:26.400 --> 43:27.680
Cornstarch?

43:27.720 --> 43:29.320
Which is found pretty much
everywhere.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.880
But the dispersal of the powder -
not just all over the clothes

43:31.920 --> 43:34.640
but embedded in the fabric -
prompted a best guess.

43:35.960 --> 43:39.200
I think your victim was in
a car where the air bag exploded.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.200
Maconi has form for stolen airbags.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.440
That's leverage.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.280
He tells us where Beale is

43:46.320 --> 43:49.120
or we take our time turning his
garage over.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.560
Yeah, starting with that
machine room upstairs.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.639
Marks on his vice match marks on
Tina's screwdrivers.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.320
My guess is she's into air-bag theft

43:56.360 --> 43:58.160
and bent the tips to prise
them out...

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
Always happy to help!

44:12.320 --> 44:15.679
There's no bruising in the
musculature of the neck.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.080
OK.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.799
The hyoid bone is fractured,
but there's no bleeding.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.159
And that tells you what?

44:21.160 --> 44:24.039
That the ligature wound
was inflicted after death.

44:24.040 --> 44:25.519
The skull fracture killed her?

44:25.520 --> 44:27.520
Making strangulation redundant.

44:29.120 --> 44:32.440
Maybe not.
Maybe that was the main event.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.799
I worked on
a serial case when I was a DC.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.639
The guy's thing
was posthumous mutilation.

44:39.640 --> 44:43.760
He killed his victims with
a hammer and then had his fun.

44:44.800 --> 44:48.160
He's confident,
careful and forensically aware.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.720
I'd be very surprised
if he hadn't killed before.

44:55.080 --> 44:59.200
I might be able to help with a
timeline on the injury to Lucy's ear.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.440
How?

45:00.480 --> 45:03.880
A recent selfie.
Uploaded automatically to her cloud.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.920
Yeah.

45:08.313 --> 45:13.600
Note... there, the lovely -
but snaggable - earrings.

45:13.640 --> 45:16.280
Photo was taken nine days ago.

45:16.320 --> 45:19.920
You thought the ear injury
was over a week old.

45:19.960 --> 45:22.519
Could have just been
a sartorial mishap.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.680
But it would be nice to be sure.

45:24.720 --> 45:29.040
If you'd nothing to hide, Mr Beale,
why did you run?

45:29.080 --> 45:31.239
You never said you was police!

45:31.240 --> 45:33.520
You never gave us much chance.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.039
I didn't know who you were.

45:36.040 --> 45:39.040
Tina had a lot of dodgy mates,
God rest her soul.

45:41.320 --> 45:43.080
God rest her soul.

45:45.960 --> 45:49.880
Dumped in wasteland.
Talk about insult to injury.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.839
That's where you found her?

45:51.840 --> 45:53.520
Where is this place?

45:53.560 --> 45:55.240
I ask the questions, Wesley.

45:56.240 --> 45:59.320
Your finger prints are all over
these screwdrivers.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.800
Want to tell me what the
angled tips are about?

46:03.240 --> 46:04.619
No idea.

46:04.651 --> 46:10.127
I think they make it easier to prise
the airbags out without them deploying.

46:10.194 --> 46:15.594
That's your line of work, isn't it?
Airbags. One of them, anyway.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.240
Well, what happened?
You and Tina have a falling out?

46:19.280 --> 46:20.999
She didn't want to do it any more?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.520
And you found another use
for your screwdrivers?

46:25.760 --> 46:27.719
You got a minute?

46:27.720 --> 46:30.800
We swept his car and his flat.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.240
There's no sign
of any air-bag residue.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.400
Shit!

46:37.560 --> 46:40.360
You said whoever killed Tina
had superhuman strength?

46:40.400 --> 46:42.400
Well, I didn't use
those precise words.

46:42.440 --> 46:46.040
Oh, whatever. He's a big bastard,
isn't he?

46:47.720 --> 46:49.520
I haven't got
a thing to hold him on.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.279
I'm sorry to put you
through this, Alice.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.800
It's OK.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.320
Look like them?

47:28.920 --> 47:30.080
They were Mum's.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.399
Is that your husband outside?

47:45.400 --> 47:48.160
Yes. He's waiting to take me home.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.440
So, Lucy lived here all by herself?

47:52.480 --> 47:55.120
You can ask.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.760
Why didn't big sister
get the big house?

47:59.200 --> 48:01.520
My parents cut me out of their will.

48:01.560 --> 48:06.280
They were worried whatever money they
left me would've gone straight up my nose.

48:08.240 --> 48:10.360
Back then, they were probably right.

48:15.280 --> 48:18.079
The blood found here
matched Lucy's DNA.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.600
Lucy told her sister
that she caught her earring

48:20.640 --> 48:22.160
on a bush getting out of a taxi.

48:23.600 --> 48:26.760
But even if the taxi didn't
drop her at the front door...

48:28.240 --> 48:31.000
Seems a stretch
she'd stumble into the bushes.

48:33.640 --> 48:35.400
So, why lie about it?

48:37.869 --> 48:42.204
We'll swab for DNA, but there's an outside
chance you won't have to wait that long.

48:42.260 --> 48:43.530
Why not?

48:43.555 --> 48:45.440
Partial print in the blood.

48:46.560 --> 48:50.640
Probably Lucy's,
but it's on the large side.

49:11.720 --> 49:12.919
Not Lucy's.

49:12.920 --> 49:15.040
Christ! That's Alice's husband.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.879
Lucy's blood. Your fingerprint.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.800
With your record, I'm thinking
you wanted drug money.

49:25.400 --> 49:28.560
When Alice's parents
cut her out of their will,

49:28.600 --> 49:30.760
Lucy promised
that she'd get her share.

49:30.800 --> 49:31.813
She reneged?

49:31.838 --> 49:34.314
They died within a month of each
other two years ago.

49:35.322 --> 49:36.495
We never saw a penny.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.207
And Alice with a baby on the way.

49:38.232 --> 49:41.487
Exactly, and we've been clean
for more than a year.

49:41.512 --> 49:42.809
Both of us.

49:42.834 --> 49:44.387
So, you confronted her?

49:50.320 --> 49:51.640
What do you want, Jasper?

49:51.665 --> 49:52.936
Can I come in a second, please?

49:52.960 --> 49:55.319
My financial affairs
are between me and my sister.

49:55.320 --> 49:57.360
Well,
your sister's carrying my child.

49:57.400 --> 50:01.064
If she wants to play happy families
with a junkie, that's her prerogative.

50:01.245 --> 50:02.337
Oh!

50:09.200 --> 50:12.240
If... If she'd have just talked
to me in a civilised way...

50:13.880 --> 50:16.240
Where were you Saturday morning?

50:16.280 --> 50:17.280
At home.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.520
With Alice?

50:18.560 --> 50:22.239
No, she had an antenatal class.

50:22.240 --> 50:26.200
You must've been crapping yourself
she'd tell Alice what you'd done.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.403
That was motive enough to shut
Lucy up, and if it wasn't?

50:29.428 --> 50:32.568
Well, there's the massive sweetener
that with her gone, Alice would inherit

50:32.593 --> 50:35.388
and you'd be moved into that big
house before the baby was born.

50:35.413 --> 50:36.513
That is NOT what happened.

50:36.538 --> 50:38.765
Prove it.
- No. That's your job.

50:49.840 --> 50:54.080
Alice. There's something
you need to know about Jasper.

50:55.760 --> 50:58.959
Tell me you've got something,
please?

50:58.960 --> 51:03.679
Jasper's car tyres match the width
of the brake marks on the lane.

51:03.680 --> 51:08.160
We can compare rubber samples
all day long, but it's not DNA.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.760
What does he do? Jasper?

51:13.800 --> 51:15.439
He taught creative writing.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.560
Interesting.

51:16.600 --> 51:17.639
Why?

51:17.640 --> 51:19.440
Well, if you're right about him,

51:19.480 --> 51:22.320
we could be looking at some
very creative staging.

51:22.360 --> 51:25.039
He runs Lucy down
but she doesn't die.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.960
He doesn't have the stomach
to kill her with his bare hands,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.759
so he keeps her somewhere
while he summons the courage.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.040
When it comes to disposal,

51:32.080 --> 51:35.200
he does everything he can
to suggest a psychosexual motive.

51:35.240 --> 51:38.960
The severed hair, the body left
naked, the posthumous strangulation.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.919
All misdirection.

51:40.920 --> 51:45.080
He is arrogant enough to try that
on, but I need more than theories.

51:45.120 --> 51:48.440
If it wasn't for the water we would
know more about where he kept her.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.560
There is one place that we
haven't looked. Her turbinates.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.199
The cavities in her nose.

51:53.200 --> 51:56.207
Not usually examined at PM,
but they can trap material

51:56.247 --> 51:58.778
not detectable elsewhere on the body.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.559
Listen, please...

53:18.560 --> 53:20.200
There's nothing
I want to hear you say.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.960
She was never going to give us
the money. Never.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.799
I-I was thinking of our baby!

53:24.800 --> 53:26.440
My baby!

53:29.040 --> 53:31.839
I ran the washings
from Lucy Chatham's turbinates -

53:31.840 --> 53:35.199
nothing out of the ordinary
except trace levels of cornstarch.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.799
Cornstarch?

53:36.800 --> 53:38.040
What?

53:42.760 --> 53:45.000
Thomas!
You're going to want to see this.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.040
What is it?
What's this sample from?

53:49.080 --> 53:52.160
This is cornstarch
found on their victim, Tina Lunt.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.760
As you know, I think it's from
an air bag. Yeah, and...?

53:54.800 --> 53:59.600
And Clarissa's just retrieved cornstarch
powder from Lucy Chatham's turbinates.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.120
The samples are identical.

54:01.247 --> 54:02.269
Hang on, hang on...

54:02.294 --> 54:03.575
If they are from airbags,

54:03.600 --> 54:05.920
then surely hundreds are deployed
every day, yeah?

54:05.960 --> 54:08.679
But the majority have
silicate filling, not cornstarch.

54:08.680 --> 54:11.200
What are the chances of two women
being murdered within a day

54:11.240 --> 54:15.560
of each other coming into contact
with the same cornstarch powder?

54:15.600 --> 54:16.919
Bloody slim, I'd say.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.239
We're working the same case.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.799
Do you have a suspect in your case?

54:20.800 --> 54:23.120
Listen... I'm not stupid.

54:24.360 --> 54:28.560
When nice people like you don't
call the police, that's unusual.

54:28.600 --> 54:32.240
When you start moving dead bodies,
that's just plain weird.

54:34.080 --> 54:37.120
I don't want an explanation.
I just want paying.

57:00.240 --> 57:02.760
Argh!

57:14.000 --> 57:15.760
Argh!

57:36.520 --> 57:38.880
If this is the same killer,
he's learning fast.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.960
We know from Lucy that you blow up
when things don't go your way.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.520
Is that what happened to Beale?

57:43.560 --> 57:46.080
You were found innocent, so why did
you change your name?

57:47.360 --> 57:50.080
And I know her well enough
to know when she's lying.

57:50.120 --> 57:52.107
I think they've seen each other.

57:52.132 --> 57:54.359
It's very important you don't take
any more calls, Jess.

57:54.360 --> 57:56.383
The police will be tracking your phone.
- What...?

57:56.408 --> 57:59.727
It's our worst decisions
that define us, Nikki -

57:59.920 --> 58:02.001
they're the ones we have to live by.
