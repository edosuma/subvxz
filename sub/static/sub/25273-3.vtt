00:00.033 --> 00:00.965
Previously on "Claws"...

00:01.000 --> 00:02.178
I want to take you on my boat.

00:02.202 --> 00:03.101
And bring Dean.

00:03.136 --> 00:05.136
Yes, and yes.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.938
You cannot be that perfect.

00:06.973 --> 00:09.107
Jennifer's house belongs to you now.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.308
I will let you tell her.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.743
She wants to give you my house.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.322
And we gon' live like some
boogie-down Brady Bunch?

00:13.346 --> 00:14.479
I guess.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.447
In two weeks, we open new clinic.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.217
I see how you inspire your girls.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.997
I can't stop thinking about
what you said about Zlata.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.787
We got to keep an eye on that psychopath.

00:22.822 --> 00:25.356
She ruined my businesses, killed my wife.

00:25.392 --> 00:26.658
I ain't taking this slowly!

00:26.693 --> 00:28.526
That Putin bitch has got to go.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.273
I was thinking maybe
we could go to counseling.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.864
Can he help me forget
the rimjob you gave Hank?

00:32.899 --> 00:35.133
I'm gonna make my cracker casserole

00:35.168 --> 00:37.969
so that you can cook your way
into his heart.

00:38.004 --> 00:39.004
I ju...

00:39.039 --> 00:40.438
No way.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.244
Honey? I'm home.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.018
Hello, sweetheart!

00:54.054 --> 00:55.653
Hello, dear.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.388
How was your day?

00:57.424 --> 00:59.857
Fantastic.

01:01.027 --> 01:04.929
Dry... just like I like it.

01:04.964 --> 01:08.032
How come you always make
everything so perfect?

01:08.068 --> 01:11.669
Darling, you make it so easy.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.472
And dinner is almost ready.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.075
Where are the kids?

01:18.712 --> 01:22.080
Children, come say hello to your father.

01:24.317 --> 01:26.651
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Hey.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.898 --> 01:41.499
Yo, Pops.

01:41.534 --> 01:44.302
Off you go, children. Go!

01:44.337 --> 01:45.370
You too.

01:46.973 --> 01:49.574
Desna, you have to keep
these kids in line.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.209
Thank God.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.577
That's dinner.

01:55.215 --> 01:56.447
Pot roast again?

01:56.483 --> 01:57.815
We had this yesterday.

01:57.851 --> 02:02.153
Well, it was buy one, get one free, dear.

02:02.188 --> 02:05.022
We don't do repeats here.
Get rid of this.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.759
Darling, what ever will we eat?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.193
I'll take the kids to dinner

02:09.229 --> 02:12.363
while you stay here and think
about what you've done.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.265
I'm so sorry, Gregory.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.566
"Sorry's" not gonna cut it.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.802
When I come here, I expect perfection!

02:17.837 --> 02:20.805
You're right. I will... I will do better.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.153
Gregory, help me!

02:36.189 --> 02:37.321
Help me!

02:41.094 --> 02:42.994
Help me!!

03:09.022 --> 03:12.190
Top of the morning, General.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.858
What you doing over here?

03:13.893 --> 03:15.626
Got to get some shit from Bryce.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.129
He ain't showing his face
after his sexcapades.

03:18.164 --> 03:20.298
He shouldn't with his nasty ass.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.501
How you sit up there and get
a BJ from your mother-in-law?

03:23.536 --> 03:25.470
Shit, we white and dirty, baby.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.239
Why you so dressed up?

03:28.274 --> 03:29.907
For your information,

03:29.943 --> 03:32.677
Gregory is taking me out
on his boat today.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.978
Ooh!

03:34.013 --> 03:35.746
You think you should be doing all that?

03:35.782 --> 03:38.015
So sure. He's taking me and Dean.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.784
It's gonna be fun. Okay.

03:39.819 --> 03:42.803
Just saying, you guys moving
kind of fast, that's all.

03:42.828 --> 03:44.027
Barely even know the man.

03:44.062 --> 03:46.029
I know him well enough.

03:46.064 --> 03:48.999
- Mind your damn business.
- For sure.

03:49.034 --> 03:50.934
You got that ol' crazy look in your eye.

03:50.969 --> 03:54.304
I just had a... weird dream. That's all.

03:54.339 --> 03:55.905
Was it wet?

03:57.109 --> 03:58.942
Bye, Roller.

03:58.977 --> 04:01.111
Hey, seriously, D,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:01.146 --> 04:03.146
I got to tell you something.

04:03.181 --> 04:04.214
What?

04:06.284 --> 04:07.606
Ruval...

04:08.220 --> 04:09.786
Ruval what?

04:10.789 --> 04:12.255
What?

04:12.290 --> 04:14.324
Say it.

04:14.359 --> 04:16.291
He's a lucky man.

04:16.327 --> 04:17.594
I know.

04:22.968 --> 04:25.969
This is not your,
average Philly cheesesteak,

04:26.004 --> 04:27.404
Bobby, okay?

04:27.439 --> 04:28.638
We make it with love.

04:28.674 --> 04:29.973
Morning, roomie.

04:31.276 --> 04:33.810
Doritos and Cheez Whiz?

04:33.845 --> 04:36.079
Con queso, girl.

04:36.114 --> 04:37.914
Well, at least you're not drinking.

04:37.949 --> 04:39.816
Talk to your mama?

04:39.851 --> 04:42.318
25 missed calls.

04:42.354 --> 04:43.975
Bryce?

04:44.823 --> 04:46.263
He picked up the girls this morning,

04:46.291 --> 04:48.692
and I swear to God, the first
thing I thought of was,

04:48.727 --> 04:49.620
"I'm gonna flash him

04:49.645 --> 04:51.177
- "my tits, like old times."
- Flash him your tits.

04:51.201 --> 04:52.373
But then I remembered I hate him.

04:52.397 --> 04:55.065
After that beatdown
we gave him, he knows.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.966
Somehow, that did not
make me feel better.

04:57.002 --> 04:58.768
Why don't you go out and spend

04:58.804 --> 05:00.704
some of that money we got from Zlata?

05:00.739 --> 05:02.038
That'll make you feel better.

05:02.074 --> 05:04.107
I already did.
I spent it all at Forever 41.

05:04.142 --> 05:06.242
I spent mine, too... on this look.

05:06.278 --> 05:08.044
I'm supposed to go on a boat
with Gregory,

05:08.080 --> 05:09.946
but I can cancel and stay here with you.

05:09.981 --> 05:10.992
My God, no, no, no.
I'm getting up, I'm getting up.

05:11.016 --> 05:12.382
No, I...

05:12.417 --> 05:14.195
- Literally, it's not a big deal.
- No, ma'am.

05:14.219 --> 05:15.518
Yes, ma'am, it is. Yes, ma'am.

05:15.554 --> 05:17.053
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

05:17.089 --> 05:18.800
- I can cancel.
- Listen, he is taking Dean.

05:18.824 --> 05:20.356
That is serious. That means he's ready

05:20.392 --> 05:22.292
- to take it to the next level.
- Okay.

05:22.327 --> 05:24.027
- You know I'm right.
- We don't know that.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.773
You are not... Yes, we do,
and you're not gonna waste

05:25.797 --> 05:27.470
this maritime realness.

05:27.505 --> 05:28.816
Looking all good.

05:28.851 --> 05:30.945
I'm not getting any orange stuff
in your hair. Don't be weird.

05:30.969 --> 05:32.802
All right. This is gonna be good, girl.

05:32.838 --> 05:34.237
Come on, you got to go.

05:34.272 --> 05:35.839
Don't let me ruin two relationships.

05:35.874 --> 05:36.940
Come on.

05:36.975 --> 05:38.541
One of us needs to exhale.

05:38.577 --> 05:42.545
Ooh, and one of us needs to bathe.

05:42.581 --> 05:43.947
Yeah, I said it.

05:43.982 --> 05:46.082
Hurtful.

05:47.486 --> 05:48.518
Ahoy.

05:51.356 --> 05:53.189
Come on, baby, we got to go.

05:53.225 --> 05:56.593
That's... That's the J/122e sloop.

05:56.628 --> 05:59.329
It's, 12.19 meters.

05:59.364 --> 06:02.065
T-That's length overall.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.749
- Dean.
- Yeah.

06:03.784 --> 06:05.279
I want you to be on
your best behavior today.

06:05.303 --> 06:06.770
You understand? Yeah, I-I'm always

06:06.805 --> 06:08.171
on my best behavior.

06:08.206 --> 06:10.006
Um, Dessie, I-I want to... I want to talk

06:10.041 --> 06:11.241
to you about something.

06:11.276 --> 06:12.675
You want to talk to me about what?

06:12.711 --> 06:14.274
- Um...
- Wait a minute.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.180
- Ooh, that's...
- Hey.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.549
Hello, darling.

06:19.584 --> 06:22.118
Tell me, what is update for new clinic?

06:22.154 --> 06:23.353
I spoke with the contractors,

06:23.388 --> 06:24.954
and we're on track for next week.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.524
Good. Breaking kneecaps
of his wife worked.

06:27.559 --> 06:29.526
Come to the office. We discuss plans

06:29.561 --> 06:32.662
for St. Petersburg location, we have tea.

06:32.697 --> 06:35.031
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.299
Nails can wait.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.234
No, no, no, I took a personal day.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.303
I'll be back in the salon
later this afternoon.

06:40.338 --> 06:43.006
- This involve a man?
- You're good.

06:43.041 --> 06:45.441
Ruval planned a special day
for us on the water.

06:45.477 --> 06:47.677
But look, if you need me
to come back now,

06:47.712 --> 06:49.412
I can cut this short.

06:49.447 --> 06:52.771
Is important for lieutenant
to have balance

06:52.806 --> 06:55.218
in personal and professional life.

06:55.253 --> 06:57.153
Is chapter 11 in my book.

06:57.189 --> 06:59.022
"Merging of business and pleasure

06:59.057 --> 07:00.723
is like choking and orgasm."

07:00.759 --> 07:01.891
Yeah, I know.

07:01.927 --> 07:03.827
"One only improves the other."

07:03.862 --> 07:04.828
Have fun!

07:04.863 --> 07:06.396
Enjoy yourself.

07:06.431 --> 07:07.630
We talk later.

07:08.286 --> 07:09.432
Good.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.000
Um,

07:11.036 --> 07:13.469
I-I want to dance with Polly's boys.

07:13.505 --> 07:14.704
- What?
- Yeah.

07:15.974 --> 07:19.108
Um, my brother is not
gonna be a stripper.

07:19.144 --> 07:21.611
Well, I-I-I prefer
the term "exotic dancer."

07:21.646 --> 07:24.414
Well, I prefer not to talk
about this right now.

07:24.449 --> 07:27.250
Can we just focus on what
we got to do today?

07:27.285 --> 07:30.186
Your needs get met,
but mine get neglected.

07:30.222 --> 07:31.788
I want to dance with Polly's boys.

07:31.823 --> 07:34.290
Well, Dean. Dean. Unh-unh.

07:34.326 --> 07:36.960
We are not about to have a
conversation about you dancing

07:36.995 --> 07:38.595
butt naked on a pole, all right?

07:38.630 --> 07:41.130
- Not right now. You understand?
- Yeah.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.032
- Look at me.
- Yeah.

07:43.068 --> 07:44.100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:44.135 --> 07:45.368
All right.

07:45.403 --> 07:47.403
Let's go have fun on the boat. Come on.

07:47.439 --> 07:52.428
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

08:02.988 --> 08:04.520
I-I wonder who Matilde is.

08:04.556 --> 08:06.556
Hush. Just get on the boat.

08:06.591 --> 08:07.724
Desna.

08:07.759 --> 08:09.492
Hello, handsome!

08:09.527 --> 08:10.827
Welcome.

08:10.862 --> 08:12.562
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

08:12.597 --> 08:13.830
Wipe your feet, Dean.

08:13.865 --> 08:16.466
Hi. Okay.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.403
This is for the artist.

08:20.438 --> 08:22.805
Faber-Castell Polychromos?

08:22.841 --> 08:24.307
No expense is spared.

08:24.342 --> 08:25.909
Say "Thank you," Dean.

08:25.944 --> 08:27.377
Thank... Thank you. Thank you.

08:27.412 --> 08:29.312
I also made sure that the chef prepared

08:29.347 --> 08:31.881
a gluten- and lactose-free meal for you.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.850
- Thank you.
- Wow.

08:33.885 --> 08:35.418
You thought of everything.

08:35.453 --> 08:36.785
Come with me.

08:36.821 --> 08:39.989
And this is Matilde, my mother.

08:41.493 --> 08:44.427
So nice to meet you, Mrs. Ruval.

08:44.462 --> 08:45.962
Call me Madame.

08:45.997 --> 08:49.632
Madame, it's... nice to meet you.

08:53.238 --> 08:55.672
So, why didn't you tell me

08:55.707 --> 08:58.341
your mother was gonna be here today?

08:58.376 --> 09:00.109
She was dying to meet you.

09:00.145 --> 09:01.444
Really?

09:01.479 --> 09:04.547
You're gonna love her... just like I do.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.853
Ken, can you pick up Marnie today?

09:10.889 --> 09:12.689
I've got back-to-back clients.

09:12.724 --> 09:15.091
I don't know what's bugging her,
but she won't talk to me

09:15.126 --> 09:16.826
no matter how hard I try.

09:16.861 --> 09:18.761
Okay, bye.

09:18.797 --> 09:23.366
So, today's your
"moving in with Dean" day.

09:23.401 --> 09:25.001
Nervous?

09:25.036 --> 09:26.669
No. Do I need to be?

09:26.705 --> 09:30.073
Well, shacking up with
a beau is a huge step.

09:30.108 --> 09:31.741
Sometimes they don't flush.

09:31.776 --> 09:33.276
Hey, y'all.

09:34.913 --> 09:36.279
- You okay?
- Yeah.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.715
You know you're still wearing
your pajamas, right?

09:38.750 --> 09:40.283
Really, Ann? I thought I was wearing

09:40.318 --> 09:42.018
Selena Gomez's new loungewear line.

09:42.053 --> 09:44.620
Okay, maybe I should have one of
the other girls do me today.

09:44.656 --> 09:46.956
- Don't be silly, Nico. I said I'm fine.
- Ouch!

09:46.992 --> 09:50.326
Okay, hey, girl, why don't you
let me take over here?

09:50.362 --> 09:51.427
Okay? Whatever for, Pol?

09:51.463 --> 09:53.096
I said I'm fine. "Fine," my butt.

09:53.131 --> 09:54.731
You don't have to pretend with us.

09:54.766 --> 09:58.434
- We were there.
- Some of us weren't there.

09:58.470 --> 10:01.104
What? We don't just come in here
just for our mani-pedis.

10:01.139 --> 10:03.373
Did Baylor find your vibrator again?

10:03.408 --> 10:05.575
Did Brienne's father break out of prison?

10:05.610 --> 10:07.176
- I wish.
- Come on, girl, spill it.

10:07.212 --> 10:09.312
We will listen without judgment.

10:10.615 --> 10:12.348
Let it out.

10:14.719 --> 10:16.599
Last night, I caught my mama...

10:17.559 --> 10:19.956
about to do Bryce's dick like a Popsicle.

10:19.991 --> 10:21.457
Now, how you let that happen?

10:21.493 --> 10:23.693
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

10:25.163 --> 10:28.731
Sadly, Darline, Marlissa, and Jessica

10:28.767 --> 10:32.201
lost most of their families
during the last hurricane.

10:32.237 --> 10:34.837
That is terrible. I'm so sorry, girls.

10:34.873 --> 10:36.706
My... My sister and I were foster kids.

10:36.741 --> 10:38.941
We lost our parents to drugs.

10:38.977 --> 10:40.376
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

10:40.412 --> 10:43.679
We sort of act as a foster care,
as well, you know?

10:43.715 --> 10:46.315
Matilde's Heart
is a charitable organization

10:46.351 --> 10:48.551
that, is there to find homes

10:48.586 --> 10:50.920
for the orphaned girls from Haiti.

10:50.955 --> 10:53.723
Yes. And because of my son,

10:53.758 --> 10:56.492
these poor, unfortunate girls

10:56.528 --> 10:58.828
are going to live the kind of life

10:58.863 --> 11:02.298
filled with opportunities
they never dreamed of.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.334
That is... amazing.

11:05.370 --> 11:07.303
Is there anything you don't do?

11:07.338 --> 11:09.405
I just like to help.

11:09.441 --> 11:12.008
- My mama taught me.
- Yes.

11:12.043 --> 11:15.545
So, how long are you girls
gonna be in Sarasota?

11:18.049 --> 11:19.415
Unresponsive.

11:19.451 --> 11:21.117
Maybe they're on the spectrum, too.

11:21.152 --> 11:23.786
Maybe... you want to bring
them by my salon

11:23.822 --> 11:27.457
and I can treat them
to a day of pampering.

11:27.492 --> 11:30.860
You know, my way of saying
"Welcome to America," ladies.

11:30.895 --> 11:33.329
Now, that is very sweet of you to offer.

11:33.364 --> 11:35.765
I see why my son likes you.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.334
He talks about you all the time.

11:38.369 --> 11:39.735
He told me...

11:39.771 --> 11:42.038
- Mama.
- Don't interrupt me!

11:53.685 --> 11:55.184
Come on.

11:55.220 --> 11:56.586
Why is he feeding her?

11:56.621 --> 11:58.061
- Mnh-mnh.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh. Eat.

12:00.258 --> 12:01.991
She loves strawberries.

12:04.929 --> 12:08.297
Who's been a real, real...

12:08.333 --> 12:10.166
bad boy today?

12:10.201 --> 12:11.575
Say it! You are such a pathetic

12:11.600 --> 12:13.436
disappointment to me!

12:13.471 --> 12:15.204
Goddamn it, Zorro!

12:15.240 --> 12:18.007
- Ever hear of knocking?
- That's a very good look for you.

12:20.845 --> 12:23.546
- Is for my diary.
- The hell you want?

12:23.581 --> 12:26.983
For you to prove
your usefulness... to me.

12:27.018 --> 12:29.619
I'm already doing bank runs.
What you want me to do?

12:29.654 --> 12:32.021
You must introduce me to your contacts

12:32.056 --> 12:33.489
in local law enforcement.

12:33.525 --> 12:35.992
Beat it, Babushka.
You may think you're the KGB,

12:36.027 --> 12:39.061
but this is still the U.S.,
and you can kiss my ass!

12:39.097 --> 12:40.696
You must do this today,

12:40.732 --> 12:44.667
or next time, I will not be this polite.

12:44.702 --> 12:46.124
Boop!

12:46.871 --> 12:48.104
Get back over here, boy.

12:50.723 --> 12:53.442
So, your mama was
going down on your husband?

12:53.478 --> 12:57.146
I know. I just can't even stop
seeing it over and over.

12:57.182 --> 12:58.814
I just keep replaying it.

12:58.850 --> 13:01.817
I am this close to eating a tub
of Funfetti icing in my car.

13:03.087 --> 13:05.121
I ate a tub of Funfetti icing in my car.

13:05.156 --> 13:07.490
Well, when you have a connection

13:07.525 --> 13:10.565
with someone, you don't let that shit go.

13:11.095 --> 13:13.963
I've been trying for months to
have a connection with Marnie,

13:13.998 --> 13:15.153
but...

13:15.733 --> 13:17.300
she keeps shutting me out.

13:19.037 --> 13:21.737
You just need to reconnect.

13:21.773 --> 13:22.905
I've tried.

13:22.941 --> 13:25.208
I've called him a million times.

13:25.243 --> 13:26.642
He won't even answer.

13:26.678 --> 13:28.583
What about naked FaceTime?

13:29.147 --> 13:31.047
What? It works.

13:31.082 --> 13:32.546
You know.

13:32.582 --> 13:34.650
- See?
- I know how to get him here.

13:36.621 --> 13:38.621
Toussaint, the captain,

13:38.656 --> 13:40.467
he said he could take me
whale watching next week.

13:40.491 --> 13:42.258
- Can I go?
- I don't see why not.

13:42.293 --> 13:43.859
Yeah, it's whale watching. Thanks.

13:43.895 --> 13:46.028
Are you and Gregory getting married?

13:46.064 --> 13:47.330
Dean, I don't know.

13:47.365 --> 13:49.198
Why would you ask me something like that?

13:49.234 --> 13:50.600
I-isn't that why, um,

13:50.635 --> 13:52.602
men introduce women to their mothers?

13:52.637 --> 13:54.770
When they...

13:54.806 --> 13:56.706
Hey, hey, Gregory... Dr. Gregory. Hi.

13:56.741 --> 13:58.874
I'm going whale watching.

13:58.910 --> 14:00.109
Toussaint.

14:00.144 --> 14:01.744
Come here.

14:01.779 --> 14:04.947
Have I told you how good you look today?

14:04.983 --> 14:07.450
Well, I have my mother to thank for that.

14:07.485 --> 14:09.585
She picks out all my suits.

14:10.588 --> 14:15.258
Have I told you how magnificent
you look today?

14:15.293 --> 14:16.592
Well, thank you.

14:16.628 --> 14:18.728
I picked this out all by myself.

14:24.269 --> 14:25.848
Gregory!

14:26.437 --> 14:29.438
Devan moun tankou sa', Gregory?

14:29.474 --> 14:32.575
She hates public displays of affection.

14:33.911 --> 14:36.012
- I thought we were alone.
- Well, you are not!

14:36.047 --> 14:39.982
How many other people are there
here on my yacht?

14:40.018 --> 14:42.151
Disrespectful son!

14:42.657 --> 14:44.253
No, I do not disrespect you.

14:44.289 --> 14:46.222
Ou pa respekte.

14:46.257 --> 14:49.625
We are so sorry, Madame.

14:56.200 --> 15:01.804
I am your mother, and you
do not do me like that.

15:03.107 --> 15:04.674
Are you okay?

15:04.709 --> 15:07.143
Give me a minute.

15:07.178 --> 15:09.445
Mama!

15:09.480 --> 15:10.480
Mama!

15:12.050 --> 15:13.783
Ain't this some shit?

15:14.856 --> 15:17.319
Go away!

15:17.354 --> 15:22.476
Madame, we are very sorry
about the kissing.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.668
Gregory and I work a lot, and we
don't get to see each other

15:25.703 --> 15:27.903
that much, and I'm sorry

15:27.939 --> 15:31.307
that we got carried away
and we offended you.

15:31.342 --> 15:32.808
Continue. Come on.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.076
It's working. You go.

15:34.111 --> 15:36.045
No, continue, please.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.115
Um... Gregory talks to me all the time

15:40.151 --> 15:42.718
about how much he loves you and...

15:42.753 --> 15:46.055
and how special you are,
and he said that,

15:46.090 --> 15:48.023
back in Port-au-Prince,
you would walk with him

15:48.059 --> 15:49.792
for 3 miles just so he could go

15:49.827 --> 15:51.994
to a good English-speaking school.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.597
You are everything to him.

15:54.632 --> 15:56.765
He says it all the time.

16:05.409 --> 16:09.178
I used to be the most important
woman in his world.

16:09.213 --> 16:13.664
Believe me, Madame,
I-I think you still are.

16:19.290 --> 16:22.791
Hi, Mrs. Huffnagel.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

16:24.829 --> 16:27.129
My whisker biscuit hurts.

16:27.164 --> 16:29.164
Your... whisker biscuit?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.599
My pooter. Um...

16:30.635 --> 16:32.101
My mush mitten.

16:32.136 --> 16:33.068
Your... vagina?

16:33.104 --> 16:35.971
That's right.

16:36.007 --> 16:38.073
Ever since my little Terry was born.

16:38.109 --> 16:40.342
And, how long ago was that?

16:40.378 --> 16:43.012
64 years ago in September.

16:47.151 --> 16:48.651
Thank you.

16:52.590 --> 16:54.056
What the hell? I thought you said

16:54.091 --> 16:55.891
- the power was out.
- We need to talk.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.226
You're not supposed to be here.

16:57.261 --> 16:58.994
Bryce, we have both made huge mistakes.

16:59.030 --> 17:01.196
Yeah, mine was a drunken accident.

17:01.232 --> 17:03.766
Yours was calculated
and willing intercourse.

17:03.801 --> 17:05.367
Babe.

17:05.403 --> 17:08.203
Yeah.

17:08.239 --> 17:09.704
Nope.

17:09.740 --> 17:13.642
Ain't this rich?
Y'all already tried to jump me.

17:13.678 --> 17:15.109
Let me out!

17:15.146 --> 17:16.412
Not until we talk.

17:16.446 --> 17:17.579
Come on, Bryce.

17:17.615 --> 17:18.914
Y'all are such a cute couple.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.883
We were a cute couple. Not anymore.

17:20.917 --> 17:22.984
Bryce, our girl wants
to work this stuff out,

17:23.020 --> 17:24.252
so that's what we're gonna do.

17:24.288 --> 17:25.766
Yeah, that's what we're gonna do, Polly?

17:25.790 --> 17:26.655
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:26.691 --> 17:28.490
Sit down, Bryce.

17:33.264 --> 17:36.599
I'm gonna sit right here.
How y'all feel about that?

17:38.869 --> 17:41.337
Okay, bye, Dr. Gregory. Bye.

17:44.842 --> 17:47.176
Thank you for doing that.

17:47.211 --> 17:49.878
My mother can be very emotional.

17:49.914 --> 17:51.680
She pushes all my buttons.

17:51.716 --> 17:53.649
She is intense.

17:53.684 --> 17:56.051
Yeah. You can say it.

17:56.087 --> 17:59.221
I have to add an entire new wing
in my house

17:59.256 --> 18:02.257
just because she doesn't like
where some of the windows are.

18:02.293 --> 18:04.059
- A wing?
- Yes.

18:04.095 --> 18:06.862
Is that for her to
stay in when she visits?

18:06.897 --> 18:08.831
No, no, she's moving in.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.200
Wonderful.

18:11.235 --> 18:14.470
That means I get to see her
every time I come over.

18:14.505 --> 18:16.772
Exactly. It's so perfect.

18:16.807 --> 18:21.243
I just want you to enjoy
all of this all the time.

18:24.382 --> 18:26.148
I love you, Desna.

18:27.718 --> 18:30.552
I don't know what to say.

18:33.090 --> 18:36.792
Thank you, Gregory, for today.

18:36.827 --> 18:39.194
Thank... Thank you for everything.

18:39.230 --> 18:40.629
Of course.

18:41.699 --> 18:43.265
See you soon?

18:46.237 --> 18:49.071
N-Now can we talk about dancing?

18:51.847 --> 18:52.879
Come on.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.350
Okay.

19:11.385 --> 19:12.417
Heads.

19:13.687 --> 19:17.089
Right now, you both have your chances

19:17.124 --> 19:18.557
to make your opening statements

19:18.592 --> 19:20.859
about the state of your relationship.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.661
Please be brief.

19:22.696 --> 19:24.529
- We have a timer.
- So stupid.

19:24.565 --> 19:26.832
Unh! We ask that you withhold
your comments

19:26.867 --> 19:28.067
until it's your turn to speak.

19:28.102 --> 19:30.202
You each have 30 seconds for rebuttal.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.037
Jenn, you won the coin toss.

19:32.072 --> 19:34.273
Your time begins now.

19:34.308 --> 19:38.277
Bryce, I know that
I messed up, but my mama?

19:38.312 --> 19:41.980
I mean, you know she's got a
track record for doing that.

19:42.016 --> 19:44.016
You know she's done it to me before.

19:44.051 --> 19:45.751
And you know how that would make me feel.

19:45.786 --> 19:47.119
How it made you feel?

19:47.154 --> 19:49.288
Bryce! She still
has 20 seconds on the clock.

19:49.323 --> 19:51.156
I still feel like vomiting
from what I saw.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.924
Bryce, look at me!

19:52.960 --> 19:54.359
If you don't silence yourself,

19:54.395 --> 19:56.595
we'll be forced to deduct from your time.

19:56.630 --> 19:57.896
Do you understand me?

19:57.931 --> 20:00.198
That's the woman that pushed me
out of her cooch.

20:00.234 --> 20:02.434
He was in your cooch! All up in it!

20:02.469 --> 20:05.137
Hold that thought.

20:05.172 --> 20:06.438
Hey, Desna.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.040
Polly, he told me he loved me,

20:08.075 --> 20:09.675
and I couldn't even say it back.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.610
Girl, I don't know how to make this work.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.612
Um, hey, can we talk about this when you

20:13.647 --> 20:15.392
get to the salon?
'Cause we're a little busy.

20:15.416 --> 20:17.749
Maybe it's 'cause he
introduced me to his mama.

20:17.785 --> 20:21.920
That right there was a real
Haitian mommy dearest shitshow.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.256
I-Is that Polly? Ask her if I can dance.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.191
We'll talk about this later.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.926
B-But you said that before.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.995
- Dean.
- 'Cause this is later.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.496
Yes, let's talk about this later.

20:31.532 --> 20:33.665
We've actually got something
going on here. Okay, bye.

20:33.701 --> 20:34.766
Pol.

20:34.802 --> 20:36.068
Hello?

20:42.576 --> 20:43.909
Where your brother at?

20:43.944 --> 20:46.378
What do I look like, my
brother's keeper or something?

20:47.715 --> 20:49.214
Let's get this over with.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.982
Bogdan need his dip-tet.

20:51.018 --> 20:52.918
What the... When did you turn into such

20:52.953 --> 20:54.219
a little whipped pussy?

20:54.254 --> 20:56.221
Bo needs his vaccinations, baby.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.690
Gentlemen, I have to get
back to the precinct.

20:58.726 --> 21:00.659
I ain't got all damn day.

21:00.694 --> 21:04.463
- What you got?
- Well, I find myself in a tight spot,

21:04.498 --> 21:07.065
and you the KY Jelly
gon' get me out of it.

21:07.101 --> 21:08.800
I'm listening.

21:08.836 --> 21:10.969
And slightly repulsed.

21:11.004 --> 21:13.372
I got this new Russian lady boss.

21:13.407 --> 21:15.340
I got to kind of prove to her that

21:15.376 --> 21:17.409
I'm valuable to the operation.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.810
So I'm gonna give her you.

21:18.846 --> 21:20.178
What happened to Riva?

21:20.214 --> 21:21.813
Well, that's a question you could ask

21:21.849 --> 21:24.616
when you get on the inside with
her she-devil replacement.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.486
Little crazy, but perks are on point.

21:27.521 --> 21:29.554
Sounds like someone drank the Kool-Aid.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.690
You know I love the Kool-Aid.

21:31.725 --> 21:34.226
Listen, it's just temporary, and I'm...

21:34.261 --> 21:35.761
I'll make it worth your while.

21:35.796 --> 21:37.195
How you gonna do that?

21:37.231 --> 21:40.031
Well, when we're back in charge,

21:40.741 --> 21:43.068
I'm gonna up your percentage.

21:43.103 --> 21:44.936
You mean you'll double it.

21:48.409 --> 21:50.167
All right, you got a deal.

21:54.748 --> 21:57.649
I'm not saying I'm the perfect man, okay?

21:57.684 --> 21:59.684
Jenn, shh! Shh!

21:59.720 --> 22:01.686
Especially after all the shit
we've been through

22:01.722 --> 22:03.588
in the past year, but goddamn it,

22:03.624 --> 22:05.223
something goes wrong between us,

22:05.259 --> 22:07.070
first thing you do is you turn
around and cheat on me?

22:07.094 --> 22:08.293
Bryce, it was one time.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.961
You're a liar!

22:09.997 --> 22:11.430
You gave him a rimjob.

22:11.465 --> 22:13.131
Nobody does that on the first time.

22:14.902 --> 22:16.301
That's true.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.170
That kind of trust takes
years to establish.

22:18.205 --> 22:20.238
Well, actually, some of us like

22:20.274 --> 22:22.007
to get the freaky shit out the way first.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.475
- Shut up, Virginia.
- Okay.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.211
Bottom line... Bottom line

22:26.246 --> 22:28.372
is that I was drunk

22:29.249 --> 22:32.384
and I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.620
But that doesn't compare to what you did.

22:35.656 --> 22:38.557
Okay, well, what I did
wasn't with your dad!

22:38.592 --> 22:39.891
My dad is dead.

22:39.927 --> 22:41.693
Okay. Okay.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.462
I think it's time that we move on

22:43.497 --> 22:46.965
to the question-and-answer
portion of the debate.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.569
You will each have 15 seconds
to answer this question.

22:50.604 --> 22:51.803
Quiet Ann.

22:55.542 --> 22:59.110
As a person whose... relationship

22:59.146 --> 23:00.812
has recently been destroyed by someone

23:00.848 --> 23:02.573
I thought was my friend,

23:03.717 --> 23:05.367
I was wondering...

23:06.420 --> 23:08.954
do you two even still love each other?

23:11.458 --> 23:14.559
Gentle reminder...
you're still on the clock.

23:14.595 --> 23:17.329
Mr. Chip, you work for me now.

23:17.364 --> 23:18.830
Not Uncle Fatty.

23:18.866 --> 23:20.298
Just curious...

23:20.334 --> 23:22.901
what happened to your predecessor, Riva?

23:22.936 --> 23:24.402
My sister?

23:24.438 --> 23:27.873
She had to go back to Russia
on short notice.

23:27.908 --> 23:29.741
Think of me as new her.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.276
Okay, new Riva.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.114
My price doubled.

23:37.818 --> 23:40.752
I like a man who wears
corruption on his sleeve.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.088
Get us some drinks to celebrate.

23:44.458 --> 23:46.324
You heard the lady. Go get some drinks.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.926
No, no, no, no. Not him.

23:47.961 --> 23:49.227
You.

23:49.263 --> 23:51.263
Bring bottle of vodka and shot glass.

23:51.298 --> 23:52.464
Not cheap one.

23:59.406 --> 24:00.672
And we're back.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.707
In a heartbreaking turn of events,

24:02.743 --> 24:05.844
Bryce has just declared that
he no longer loves Jenn.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.479
What do you mean you don't love me?

24:07.514 --> 24:09.014
I said I love you.

24:09.049 --> 24:10.482
I know you love me.

24:10.517 --> 24:13.618
It's complicated, okay?
I just can't erase what you did.

24:13.654 --> 24:15.720
Well, then what about forgiveness?

24:17.090 --> 24:19.324
Is there a world in which you two

24:19.359 --> 24:22.727
loving, God-fearing,
highly sexual Americans

24:22.763 --> 24:24.996
can put all this insanity behind you

24:25.032 --> 24:26.698
and get back to your marriage?

24:26.733 --> 24:27.899
- No.
- Yes.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.937
Okay, you mean to tell me
that I can let go of my mom,

24:31.972 --> 24:34.005
the lying, the drugs,

24:34.041 --> 24:38.310
the murder, the neglect,
the shitty parenting,

24:38.345 --> 24:40.779
- and you can't let go of Hank?
- Hey...

24:40.814 --> 24:43.281
You did coke off a turtle, Bryce!

24:43.317 --> 24:45.016
Well, at least I'm not tongue darting

24:45.052 --> 24:46.551
fart boxes all over town!

24:46.587 --> 24:48.019
Hey! Nunh-unh!

24:48.055 --> 24:49.387
That's bullshit!

24:58.999 --> 25:00.231
Hey!

25:00.267 --> 25:03.368
What the hell is going on in here?!

25:03.403 --> 25:05.003
These goddamn bitches lost their mind.

25:05.038 --> 25:06.671
Snap! Now you're
gonna call us bitches?

25:06.940 --> 25:07.940
S, too?

25:13.577 --> 25:14.817
What the hell are you thinking?

25:14.845 --> 25:15.978
He won't forgive me.

25:16.013 --> 25:17.424
Said he doesn't even know if he loves me.

25:17.448 --> 25:18.880
Can you blame him?

25:20.427 --> 25:22.127
Since when are you on his side?

25:22.162 --> 25:23.928
No, no. Don't do that.

25:23.964 --> 25:25.797
This is not about sides.

25:25.832 --> 25:29.000
Okay, you cheated on
the best man you ever had,

25:29.035 --> 25:31.703
and I ain't talking about
no one-night stand.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.838
You had an affair.

25:33.874 --> 25:35.840
And now every time Bryce does a run,

25:35.876 --> 25:37.642
he's got to walk past this man

25:37.677 --> 25:39.244
knowing you betrayed him

25:39.279 --> 25:41.179
and you won't take
responsibility for that.

25:41.214 --> 25:42.294
Don't say that.

25:42.319 --> 25:44.783
It's true. And this
ain't about the video.

25:44.818 --> 25:46.918
- You broke Bryce's heart.
- But he...

25:46.953 --> 25:50.688
I know what he did, and
he was out of order for that.

25:50.724 --> 25:53.391
But your shit is out of order, too.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.693
He hurt me!

25:55.729 --> 25:58.563
God!

26:00.801 --> 26:02.567
I want a drink so bad.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.701
God.

26:03.737 --> 26:06.204
Get to a meeting, Jennifer,

26:06.239 --> 26:08.106
'cause if I smell that shit on you,

26:08.141 --> 26:11.309
I will take you to rehab
my damn self, and you know it.

26:11.344 --> 26:12.510
No.

26:14.681 --> 26:17.182
- So, what I'm gonna do?
- I don't know.

26:17.217 --> 26:20.752
But I know if there's any chance
for you to get your man back,

26:20.787 --> 26:23.521
it's just gonna take some time.

26:23.557 --> 26:24.856
Go on back.

26:24.891 --> 26:26.724
- You got to chill.
- Yeah.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.227
Sit your black ass down somewhere.

26:31.731 --> 26:33.765
I love it when you call me black.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.400
I know.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.409
Tell me, Mr. Chip,

26:44.444 --> 26:47.612
which part of United States
did you grow up?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.080
From good ol' Mississippi.

26:49.115 --> 26:51.816
And what did your father do for living?

26:51.852 --> 26:53.885
My good daddy poached gators.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.253
Seriously?

26:55.288 --> 26:58.289
My father was tiger poacher in Siberia.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.859
I'm calling bullshit on that, Zelda.

27:00.894 --> 27:03.061
Everyone knows that tigers
only live in Africa.

27:03.096 --> 27:06.865
No shit. There are no tigers in Siberia?

27:06.900 --> 27:09.033
Not so many anymore.

27:11.204 --> 27:14.239
All right, Chipper and... Slutella.

27:14.274 --> 27:16.274
I got business to attend to.

27:16.309 --> 27:18.810
It's okay. I have to go.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.211
But we will speak soon.

27:20.247 --> 27:23.481
I'm looking forward to it.

27:24.628 --> 27:26.618
Take care, Zama-lama-ding-dong.

27:51.077 --> 27:52.610
On the house.

27:52.646 --> 27:54.979
- That's a dope name for a bakery.
- It's not a bakery.

27:55.015 --> 27:57.415
It's the oldest Islamic
organization in America.

27:57.450 --> 27:58.583
Cool.

27:58.618 --> 28:01.219
- Hey.
- Hey, y'all.

28:01.254 --> 28:02.987
Marnie, who's your new friend?

28:03.023 --> 28:04.856
This is Malik.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.191
- I'm her mom.
- Nice to meet you.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.660
You should check us out.

28:08.695 --> 28:11.262
Surprisingly, the Nation
lets white people join now.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.298
- I will then. Thanks.
- I think we'll pass

28:13.333 --> 28:16.434
on that particular publication,
but thank you.

28:16.469 --> 28:17.602
Come on. Let's go.

28:18.805 --> 28:21.639
If you wanted to go to church,
I would've taken you.

28:21.675 --> 28:23.408
It's not about religion.

28:23.443 --> 28:25.688
Malik and I were having a good
conversation before you came in.

28:25.712 --> 28:28.813
Okay, well, we can have a good
conversation on the way home.

28:28.848 --> 28:30.581
It's okay. I got my Beats.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.522
Y'all think we need to put
Jenn on suicide watch?

28:37.557 --> 28:40.425
Unless you can O.D. on Mallomars, no.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.794
She'll be fine.

28:42.829 --> 28:44.729
There she is. Hey, Zlata.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.498
How you doing?
You want your regular color?

28:47.534 --> 28:50.003
Let's try Russian Navy.

28:50.737 --> 28:54.272
So, how was date on boat?

28:54.307 --> 28:57.475
Personal and professional in balance?

28:57.510 --> 29:00.178
It was, until I met his mama.

29:00.213 --> 29:02.380
He bring his mother on date?

29:02.415 --> 29:03.982
Idiot.

29:04.017 --> 29:06.351
And I will spare y'all the details,

29:06.386 --> 29:08.786
and just say something ain't quite right

29:08.822 --> 29:10.288
between the two of them.

29:10.323 --> 29:12.824
Think I'ma fall back from
him for a little while.

29:12.859 --> 29:15.626
- Maybe for good.
- Nonsense.

29:15.662 --> 29:18.162
Crazy mother no reason
to end relationship.

29:18.198 --> 29:21.265
Bring this man to my house
tonight for dinner.

29:21.301 --> 29:25.269
If he has issues with his mama,
we will fix his shit.

29:25.305 --> 29:29.474
He will learn you are
number-one woman in his life.

29:29.509 --> 29:32.043
Look who's besties with the bosstie now.

29:32.078 --> 29:33.378
Thank you, Zlata.

29:33.413 --> 29:35.713
I don't need you all up in my personal.

29:35.749 --> 29:38.916
Desna, I not asking.

29:53.670 --> 29:55.670
We don't have to stay long, Okay?

30:04.036 --> 30:07.337
Shit. Why are all these people here?

30:12.244 --> 30:14.711
I need a drink... right now.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.490
My baby.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.075
Daddy, are you
and Mommy getting a divorce?

30:44.309 --> 30:45.869
No.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.111
I don't know.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.213
Maybe. Why do you ask?

30:50.248 --> 30:53.016
Because lately, we either
have supper with you

30:53.051 --> 30:55.819
or we have supper with Mommy,
but not both of you.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.955
That's just because Mommy and
Daddy have different schedules.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.591
Daddy, do you hate Mommy now?

31:01.626 --> 31:04.127
No, I-I don't hate Mommy.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.496
Okay, I love Mommy.

31:06.531 --> 31:10.834
Sometimes... love and hate
just look like the same thing.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.670
Let's just say we both made mistakes.

31:14.314 --> 31:15.638
Big mistakes.

31:15.674 --> 31:19.442
Why don't you just act like
a grown-up and say you're sorry?

31:23.014 --> 31:25.348
Shut up and eat your pizza.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.121
You better watch your back tonight.

31:31.156 --> 31:32.889
She seems out to get you.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.085
Screw her.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.193
Why are you even here, anyway?

31:37.229 --> 31:41.297
She called and invited me...
and offered me some caviar.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.866
Shit tastes nasty.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.936
So, Desna tells me that you own
the nail salon she manages.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.205
Is true, yes. I own chain of them,

31:49.241 --> 31:51.040
along with other business interests

31:51.076 --> 31:53.643
in and around area you call Sarasota.

31:53.678 --> 31:54.878
Very good.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.980
America is built and rebuilt

31:57.015 --> 32:00.383
by ambitious immigrant entrepreneurship.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.085
Holla that!

32:02.120 --> 32:05.955
- Desna tells me you work very hard, too.
- Yes.

32:05.991 --> 32:09.726
I try to be ready for what
tomorrow might bring.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.294
Desna is very important to me.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.129
She's important to me, as well.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.832
Maybe more important tome.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.634
Make sure you take good care of her.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.802
I would hate for you to drive
this wonderful woman away.

32:20.837 --> 32:22.472
I won't.

32:22.507 --> 32:23.873
Trust me.

32:25.377 --> 32:28.878
I would like something
a little stronger to drink.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.513
Of course.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.452
I like him.

32:35.487 --> 32:39.088
Yeah, well, you didn't see him
feeding his mama strawberries.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.124
He's mommy boy. So what?

32:41.159 --> 32:45.995
I say he's... how you say...
fish you can keep.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.764
Why did you invite Uncle Daddy?

32:47.799 --> 32:50.333
I'm trying to keep Gregory
separate from all of that.

32:50.368 --> 32:52.769
Don't worry. Fat guy is part of lesson.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.437
I need a drink.

33:00.011 --> 33:02.979
Look at you... Mr. Baby Daddy.

33:03.014 --> 33:06.749
My man's gonna be a gangsta,
just like his daddy.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.852
He doesn't mean that literally.

33:08.887 --> 33:11.921
And look at you two. You look happy.

33:11.957 --> 33:15.525
I am. We are... very happy.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.894
How sweet... you know,

33:17.929 --> 33:21.664
for woman your age to find
someone to love.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.033
Yeah, 'cause a relationship without love,

33:24.069 --> 33:26.236
that's hard, right, girlfriend?

33:26.271 --> 33:28.438
Right.

33:28.473 --> 33:30.406
Can I have the baby?

33:30.442 --> 33:32.842
Come, baby. Want to go to Mama?

33:32.878 --> 33:35.445
Whee!

33:35.480 --> 33:37.113
There we go.

33:37.148 --> 33:39.716
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.718
Okay, I'm going to use the loo.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.621
Yeah, I'll be right back.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.791
Hey, slow down, smooth operator.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.727
You hurt her, I'ma kill you.

33:54.399 --> 33:55.965
Don't touch me

33:56.001 --> 33:58.735
or speak to me in this manner again.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.069
What you gonna do?

34:02.774 --> 34:04.440
Dinner is served.

34:05.944 --> 34:09.812
Even when we get married, I want
us to have individual shelves.

34:09.848 --> 34:12.181
Okay. Whatever you think is best.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.518
Perfect. Then we're on the same page.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.353
I-I-I-I've taken the liberty
of marking all the items

34:18.389 --> 34:21.190
in the refrigerator and the
cabinet by who they belong to.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.025
What if I want some of this kombucha?

34:23.061 --> 34:24.494
No, no, the kombucha I-is mine!

34:24.529 --> 34:26.795
It's... It's mine! My name is on it.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.398
Do you see your name on it, as well?

34:28.433 --> 34:29.565
No! Exactly.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.935
So, if you want kombucha,
all you have to do is...

34:31.969 --> 34:34.337
is purchase it and then
mark it with your name.

34:34.371 --> 34:36.906
That's all you have to do...
just mark it with your name.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.975
It's a very organized yet simple system,

34:39.010 --> 34:40.877
which I think is necessary to accommodate

34:40.911 --> 34:42.110
everyone that lives here.

34:42.147 --> 34:43.545
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.230
I've even taken time to do
the un-perishables, so th...

34:50.822 --> 34:52.021
Wait a minute.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.289
I to... Who did that?

34:53.324 --> 34:54.857
Who did that?! Who did...

34:54.893 --> 34:56.693
No, no, no. It's okay.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.328
Who did that?

35:25.991 --> 35:27.657
Help, Jesus, help.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.959
Ooh, shit fire.

35:29.995 --> 35:31.828
God, that burns.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.306
That's good.

35:45.243 --> 35:47.677
That's so good.

35:49.547 --> 35:52.582
Desna is brilliant with customer support

35:52.617 --> 35:53.716
and the public relations.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.586
Why? Because she's good with people.

35:56.621 --> 36:00.990
As I was saying,
Desna knows her customers.

36:01.026 --> 36:04.327
She knows what makes their heart beat.

36:04.362 --> 36:08.931
Well, she certainly knows
what makes my heart beat.

36:09.442 --> 36:11.134
- You're making me blush.
- But it's true.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.403
Honestly, I don't know what I would do

36:13.438 --> 36:16.372
without Desna managing my business.

36:16.408 --> 36:20.009
What, What business is that, Zorba?

36:20.045 --> 36:22.078
The nail salon, Clay... obviously.

36:22.113 --> 36:24.313
- Here's to powerful women.
- Come on, Chip.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.482
Put your dick back in your pants, man.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.285
Mr. Chip is right. Desna is powerful.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.186
She's most valuable,

36:31.211 --> 36:33.356
like chief of staff.

36:33.391 --> 36:35.958
I'm afraid I have to leave early.

36:35.994 --> 36:39.228
One of my patients believes
that she's going into labor.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.597
Babies come when they are ready.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.800
- It's okay.
- I'll call you later.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.134
Okay. Okay.

36:55.046 --> 36:59.248
So, only associates remain.

37:00.552 --> 37:05.521
One of who is big, apple-headed dipshit

37:05.557 --> 37:07.690
who thinks he can piss
in my swimming pool

37:07.726 --> 37:09.225
whenever he wants to.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.797
Who, me?

37:13.631 --> 37:16.799
This is how we show men
in Russia who's boss.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.134
Get on your knees.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.016
- That's a good one. I like that.
- What's going on, Zlata?

37:22.040 --> 37:23.172
Get on your knees!

37:23.208 --> 37:24.574
I don't think so.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.209
Hey, pump the brakes. It's just a party.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.877
Hey! What the... It's a party! Come on!

37:27.912 --> 37:30.146
- Hey!
- It's my damn party!

37:30.181 --> 37:32.749
What?! What?!

37:32.784 --> 37:34.550
Zlata, please.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.121
Watch and learn.

37:38.156 --> 37:39.589
This is for "Zelda."

37:39.624 --> 37:40.723
"Zhivago."

37:40.759 --> 37:42.258
"Zorba."

37:45.263 --> 37:48.064
Now... lick my boot.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.565
Hell no!

37:49.601 --> 37:51.000
Do it. Do it!

37:51.035 --> 37:52.368
Can't we just talk about this?

37:52.403 --> 37:54.737
Forget talk. I'm gonna kill all y'all!

38:01.813 --> 38:03.479
What you waiting for?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.522
Tell me how you like it.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.690
Best boot you ever tasted?

38:16.261 --> 38:18.261
Best boot ever.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.063
Then show it.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.732
I can't look at this shit.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.535
This is better than
"Real Housewives of Atlanta."

38:25.570 --> 38:27.570
Enough.

38:29.174 --> 38:31.374
Now say my name, bitch.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.921
Zlata.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.283
You disrespect me again,

38:40.318 --> 38:43.186
boot goes up non-bleached asshole.

38:50.650 --> 38:52.488
Girl, you did that.

38:52.513 --> 38:55.047
This is what you must do
to your Dr. Ruval.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.649
I don't know about that.

38:56.684 --> 38:59.552
I like him. I can see he adores you.

38:59.587 --> 39:02.254
Man who adores woman
is good life partner,

39:02.290 --> 39:05.991
but man who's mama's boy
needs to lick boot.

39:07.595 --> 39:11.063
I'll have him lick something,
but it won't be my boot.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.665
Boot is just metaphor.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.733
If you don't put him in his place,

39:14.769 --> 39:17.736
he will keep calling for Mama,
and not in good way.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.072
I don't really know
what to do about that.

39:20.107 --> 39:23.008
Yes, you do. You wear boss lady pants.

39:23.044 --> 39:24.843
Now you spank his naked tush.

39:24.879 --> 39:27.813
It is up to you to get him
where you want him to be.

39:27.848 --> 39:32.117
I can try, Zlata, but
his mama ain't going nowhere.

39:32.153 --> 39:35.087
She will if you tell him she must.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.422
Chapter 16...

39:36.457 --> 39:40.392
"A Lesson in Female Dominance."

39:40.428 --> 39:42.294
You are persuasive.

39:42.330 --> 39:43.829
You tell them what you want,

39:43.864 --> 39:47.032
and then you force them
to do it your way.

39:47.068 --> 39:49.335
Time's up!

39:49.370 --> 39:50.869
Time's up.

39:51.906 --> 39:55.474
Righteousness
and justice throw down...

39:55.509 --> 39:58.143
So, talk to me, Mar-Mar.

39:58.179 --> 40:00.646
For the last time, the nickname
thing ain't my jam.

40:00.681 --> 40:02.114
All right.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.416
Well... if that's it,

40:04.452 --> 40:06.719
then I'm gonna... fix us
something to eat.

40:06.754 --> 40:08.787
I will call you when it's ready.

40:10.124 --> 40:11.753
Hey, um, actually,

40:11.789 --> 40:14.226
I wanted to ask you,
what's up with this photo?

40:14.261 --> 40:16.462
- What photo?
- I found it in a box

40:16.497 --> 40:18.097
when we moved out of the Bradenton.

40:18.132 --> 40:20.399
That's me and Lilian.

40:20.434 --> 40:22.635
- You have a twin sister?
- Yep.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.670
How come you never talk about her?

40:24.705 --> 40:27.740
She lives in Seattle.
We're not that close.

40:28.976 --> 40:30.576
Okay, so, I'll...

40:30.611 --> 40:33.412
I'll call you when it's ready.

40:33.447 --> 40:35.414
Let's go say hi to Mama.

40:45.726 --> 40:47.159
Yesssss!

40:47.194 --> 40:49.294
It's my ladies!

40:52.133 --> 40:53.799
Why y'all taste so good?

40:53.834 --> 40:55.000
Did they get...

40:55.036 --> 40:56.635
Did you do this ponytail?

40:56.671 --> 40:59.004
Did Daddy do this ponytail?

40:59.040 --> 41:00.305
Did you do it, Daddy?

41:00.341 --> 41:01.840
Hey, baby.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.008
You're drunk.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.410
Absolutely not. See?

41:06.247 --> 41:07.479
That's bullshit.

41:07.515 --> 41:10.015
I know loaded when I see it.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.517
Well...

41:11.552 --> 41:15.120
Dean and Virginia are here,

41:15.156 --> 41:16.889
and so they can help out.

41:16.924 --> 41:18.223
You know you love Dean.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.326
All right, come on, girls.
Y'all gonna come with me.

41:21.362 --> 41:22.461
You can't just decide that.

41:22.496 --> 41:24.363
You want DCF to decide?

41:27.101 --> 41:28.967
Okay, y'all. Okay.

41:29.003 --> 41:30.514
- Mommy, Mommy, please!
- Come on, pumpkin.

41:30.538 --> 41:32.343
I got you. I'll see y'all tomorrow.

41:32.379 --> 41:34.364
- Come on.
- We will have ladies' night.

41:34.399 --> 41:36.608
- I want to stay with Mommy!
- I got the dates wrong.

41:36.644 --> 41:38.477
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Come on, let's go.

41:38.512 --> 41:39.535
Be good. Go with Daddy.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.824
Come on. Mama can't
handle you guys tonight.

41:40.848 --> 41:42.347
- Let's go.
- Don't say that, Bryce.

41:42.383 --> 41:43.916
- Hop on in there.
- Okay.

41:43.951 --> 41:47.486
- You're okay. You're okay.
- Can't we just stay, please?

41:47.521 --> 41:50.923
- I'm sorry.
- I want to stay with Mommy!

41:50.958 --> 41:52.820
- No!
- God!

41:53.999 --> 41:55.661
I'm sorry.

41:55.696 --> 41:57.029
I'm sorry.

41:57.064 --> 41:58.397
I'm sorry.

41:58.432 --> 42:00.165
I'm sorry.

42:00.201 --> 42:02.000
I'm sorry.

42:02.036 --> 42:03.502
Dean?

42:03.537 --> 42:05.003
I changed my mind.

42:05.039 --> 42:07.806
You can dance, but you got to be
on your best behavior.

42:07.842 --> 42:10.542
You dance and then you
come home. You understand me?

42:10.578 --> 42:12.411
Right, 'cause if you don't,

42:12.446 --> 42:15.481
I will break the tips off of every one

42:15.516 --> 42:17.149
of your colored pencils.

42:17.184 --> 42:18.684
Yeah.

42:18.719 --> 42:22.087
Go on. Let your freak flag fly.

42:40.708 --> 42:44.009
- Hey.
- Hey. Um...

42:46.347 --> 42:47.613
We need to talk.

42:49.884 --> 42:53.786
When a woman says that to a man,
that usually means trouble.

42:53.821 --> 42:57.589
Look, today on the boat
with your mama was a lot.

42:57.625 --> 42:59.191
I know you said you love me,

42:59.226 --> 43:02.327
but if we're gonna try
to level up with this thing,

43:02.363 --> 43:04.563
I got to feel like I'm a priority.

43:04.598 --> 43:08.667
Listen, I'm all my mother
has left in the world.

43:10.196 --> 43:13.238
And yes, caring for her
is important to me.

43:13.616 --> 43:15.007
But I can do that.

43:15.042 --> 43:17.476
And I can also love you.

43:17.511 --> 43:18.944
Can you?

43:23.317 --> 43:25.517
Yes, I can.

43:25.553 --> 43:27.619
- You got to believe me.
- No.

43:27.655 --> 43:30.055
You got to show me.

43:31.058 --> 43:33.826
Life is about choices, Gregory.

43:33.861 --> 43:37.763
You can choose to be a boy to your mama

43:38.516 --> 43:41.144
or you can be a man tome.

43:46.974 --> 43:48.340
You choose.

43:48.375 --> 43:51.009
I just want you to be happy.

43:56.283 --> 43:59.418
Out of nothing at all.

43:59.453 --> 44:03.121
Out of nothing at all.

44:09.530 --> 44:12.831
Out of nothing at all.

44:12.867 --> 44:16.335
Out of nothing at all.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.953
- Hey, darling.
- Hey.

44:34.989 --> 44:38.156
You looked so peaceful,
I did not want to wake you.

44:38.192 --> 44:39.625
Where'd you go?

44:39.660 --> 44:40.993
I'm working.

44:41.028 --> 44:42.494
Okay, well, I won't keep you.

44:42.529 --> 44:44.123
I, um...

44:44.765 --> 44:48.100
I just wanted to tell you
that I didn't say it earlier

44:48.135 --> 44:53.205
because I was afraid, but, um...

44:53.591 --> 44:55.927
I want you to know that
I love you... Gregory.

44:56.710 --> 45:01.245
I-I really... love you.

45:02.141 --> 45:03.882
I love you, too.

45:05.853 --> 45:08.397
Okay, I'll see you when you get back.

45:10.591 --> 45:12.557
Good night.
