Ooh!

00:26.560 --> 00:27.561
Aw!

00:27.628 --> 00:31.899
Ain't they just precious!

00:31.966 --> 00:36.503
I want a bunch of cuties
just like them someday.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.070
Don't you?

00:46.614 --> 00:51.614
-The more the merrier, toots,
that's what I always say.
-(SPLASH)

00:56.324 --> 01:01.324
Would you look at that?
I'm all out of ice.

(POT SHATTERING)

01:33.460 --> 01:34.060
Ahh!

01:42.103 --> 01:47.103
Oh, Tommy, I can always
count on you.

01:48.943 --> 01:51.078
(POUNDING HEAVILY)

01:51.145 --> 01:54.048
Hey, if you don't have
any plans tonight,

01:54.115 --> 01:58.752
maybe you could come by
my place at 8:00?

01:58.819 --> 02:02.890
Okay, then. 8:00.
And Tommy...

02:02.957 --> 02:05.057
Don't be late.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.956
WOMAN: Movie night.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.192
He'll be asleep
before the opening credits.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.696

STEVENS: (ON TV)
<i>What is it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: </i> <i>I'm not sure, Stevens.</i>

02:44.798 --> 02:46.601

03:46.393 --> 03:50.231
(LOUD CRASHES)

03:50.298 --> 03:55.298
Oh, that? That's just
a monster in the basement.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.039
DOCTOR: <i>It will just be
</i> <i>the beginning of...</i>

03:59.106 --> 04:02.843

Butch?

04:19.527 --> 04:21.695
You expecting
someone else, toots?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.999
Yeah. Tommy.

04:24.065 --> 04:29.065
Well, maybe we twos
can have a little din-din
while you're waiting.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.372
No, thanks.
He'll be here soon.

04:31.439 --> 04:36.439
I'm sticking close to
the phone, in case he calls.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.880
A call from Tom.
Not a bad idea.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.024
Okay, then, 8:00.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.990

(THUDS)

05:25.659 --> 05:28.829
What? A card game? Tonight?

05:28.896 --> 05:32.433
Hey, pal,
you promised Toodles!

05:32.500 --> 05:37.500
Yeah, I'll tell her.
But I'm ashamed
to call you a friend.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.341
(SCOFFS)
The nerve of that guy!

05:40.408 --> 05:42.610
Standing me up
for a card game!

05:42.677 --> 05:47.314
Tell me about it, toots.
That tomcat
has lost his marbles.

05:47.381 --> 05:52.381
Not every guy is as dependable
as ol' Butch here.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.424
Hey, what are you
doing tonight?

05:56.490 --> 06:01.328
Me? Let me check
my appointment book.

06:01.395 --> 06:05.895
Nothing, honey. I'm all yours.

06:11.839 --> 06:15.309
These are my baby sisters,
and my little baby brother.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.078
Aren't they just adorable?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.680
Precious little angels,
they are.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.516
Knowing how you like kids,

06:22.583 --> 06:26.287
would you mind watching them
while I take my mother out?

06:26.353 --> 06:30.403
-Well, I...
-You're a doll.

06:38.966 --> 06:42.303
Well, you threes
don't seem so bad.

06:42.370 --> 06:47.041
Hey, is this how
patty-cake is played?

06:47.107 --> 06:50.244
Well, maybe later,
you can tell your big sis

06:50.311 --> 06:51.979
how much fun we had.

(THUDDING)

07:18.639 --> 07:23.639
(GASPS) It's the monster.
He's trying to escape
from the basement.

07:24.112 --> 07:28.682
DOCTOR: <i>Yes, that's right.
</i> <i>Hit him, boys.
</i> <i>Give him all you've got.</i>

07:28.749 --> 07:29.349
Now!

07:38.693 --> 07:42.062
Okay, you! No more
setting my toes on fire.

07:42.129 --> 07:47.129
And, you two!
No more hitting me, got it?

07:57.044 --> 07:59.113
Hey, don't worry about it.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.916
We just got off
on the wrong foot.

08:01.983 --> 08:05.219
Hey, tell you what.
Put in a good word for me

08:05.286 --> 08:10.286
with your big sis,
and all is forgiven.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.329
You wants me to read you
a story?

08:15.396 --> 08:18.133
I can do that. Now, let's see.

08:18.199 --> 08:22.237
We'll skip the words
and just read the pictures.
Okay?

08:22.304 --> 08:27.304
Looky here.
This big, wild bear thing
is swinging from tree to tree.

08:27.541 --> 08:32.541
Oh, he missed a branch
and is fallen. It's very...

08:35.483 --> 08:40.483
I don't hear anything.
Maybe the monster
is sleeping.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.828
(LOUD CRASH)

08:47.894 --> 08:49.296
I think he's awake now.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.499
Okay, you trio of tricksters.

08:51.565 --> 08:56.565
No more lighting firecrackers
in my face.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.742
Okay, enough with
the boo-boo eyes.

09:01.809 --> 09:06.809
But remember,
you're putting in a good word
with the sis. Right?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.317
(CLINKING)

09:10.384 --> 09:13.420
Oh, a tea party. That's nice.

09:13.487 --> 09:18.487
Aw, that's cute.
I'm sitting in the fireplace.

10:13.614 --> 10:18.614
Oh, no. We're not playing
beauty parlor.

10:21.322 --> 10:24.525
Tommy, is that you?

10:24.592 --> 10:28.729
I hope you lost at cards,
you bum.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.532
Is this your idea
of babysitting?

10:31.599 --> 10:33.334
Sorry, toots,
I changed my mind.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.269
I don't like kids,
especially those kids.
