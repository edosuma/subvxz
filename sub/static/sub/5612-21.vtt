Let's recap. As you know,

01:15.708 --> 01:18.645
Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis put
out a hit on Adrian Pimento,

01:18.670 --> 01:20.541

01:36.545 --> 01:38.559
Unfortunately, we can't
just arrest Figgis,

01:51.725 --> 01:53.163

01:53.188 --> 01:54.514

I mean, she has a full back tattoo

14:57.789 --> 14:58.869
of herself stabbing a guy.

14:58.894 --> 15:00.075
He looks like Tom Hanks!

15:00.100 --> 15:01.842
Yeah, and that's
America's male sweetheart.

15:01.867 --> 15:02.917
I can't believe this.

15:02.942 --> 15:04.489
You wouldn't tell Rosa to stand down.

15:04.514 --> 15:06.338
Well, yeah, because she's Rosa.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.934
I mean, one time, I saw
her eat a whole apple

15:07.959 --> 15:09.751
using a knife, just like in the movies.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.139
Get over the apple thing.
That was three years ago.

15:12.164 --> 15:13.333
I know, it was just so cool.

15:13.358 --> 15:14.758
Look, I'm your handler, all right?

15:14.783 --> 15:16.506
You have to just trust me on this.

15:16.531 --> 15:18.833
My job is to keep you
safe. It's the right call.

15:20.109 --> 15:22.249
Fine, I'll slow-play it.

15:22.274 --> 15:24.326
But people are getting suspicious,

15:24.351 --> 15:25.512
so you can't come running in

15:25.538 --> 15:27.537
every time I'm in the
same room with her, okay?

15:27.562 --> 15:28.897
Yeah, okay.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.825
Are we good?

15:30.911 --> 15:32.529
Yeah, we're good.

15:32.554 --> 15:35.050
This is so sweet. Now kiss her belly.

15:35.074 --> 15:36.385
- Boyle!
- Boyle!

15:36.411 --> 15:38.381
So let us all bow our heads

15:38.406 --> 15:41.481
and join together for
a moment of silence.

15:41.506 --> 15:44.586
[organ music plays softly]

15:44.611 --> 15:46.970
[scoffs] This church is so quiet.

15:46.995 --> 15:49.593
Pretty normal for a moment of silence.

15:49.814 --> 15:53.689
Captain has eyes on a guy
he thinks might be Scar-Joe.

15:55.910 --> 15:58.561

16:36.369 --> 16:37.440
Why did he run then?

16:37.465 --> 16:38.643
He's a pickpocket.

16:38.668 --> 16:40.912
I guess the bereft are easy targets.

16:40.937 --> 16:42.886
Also, Scully, here's your wallet back.

16:43.984 --> 16:45.288
How's Amy doing?

16:45.313 --> 16:47.367
Is she paying enough
attention to her pelvic floor?

16:47.392 --> 16:48.575
Ignoring that.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.080
She is keeping a low profile,
just like we discussed.

16:51.105 --> 16:52.582
I'm really impressed with you two.

16:52.608 --> 16:54.208
You disagreed with the best strategy,

16:54.233 --> 16:56.018
but talked it through like adults.

16:56.043 --> 16:57.354
Well, the key is trust.

16:57.379 --> 16:59.192
I trust her to stay out of danger,

16:59.217 --> 17:00.590
and she trusts me not to interfere.

17:00.615 --> 17:01.137
Oh, my God.

17:01.162 --> 17:02.668
She just pushed Figgis into the garbage.

17:02.693 --> 17:05.137
She's in danger. I must interfere.

think you're doing, huh?

All right, Cortez,

17:16.005 --> 17:16.786
No, you don't.

17:16.810 --> 17:19.190
It's your uterus, it's... gonna explode.

17:19.214 --> 17:20.481
- What?
- Come with me.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.011
Stand back, everyone. You're
all in the splash zone.

- What the hell?

17:27.348 --> 17:29.011
We agreed you weren't gonna do that.

17:29.036 --> 17:30.851
You disobeyed a direct
order from your handler.

17:30.876 --> 17:33.404
Yeah, I did. Because
that order was crap.

17:33.429 --> 17:34.325
I did the right thing

17:34.350 --> 17:36.150
and it's insulting that
you don't see that.

17:36.175 --> 17:37.044
Hey, hey, hey.

17:37.069 --> 17:38.729
The baby can hear you yelling
and it's upsetting him.

17:38.754 --> 17:40.286
It's a fake baby, Charles.

17:40.311 --> 17:41.841
I meant me. The baby's a cover.

17:41.866 --> 17:42.788
Okay, stop.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.475
You're right. I'm 100% in the wrong.

17:47.415 --> 17:48.536
The truth is, I'm the one

17:48.561 --> 17:50.200
that's not tough enough to be in here.

17:50.225 --> 17:51.695

17:51.720 --> 17:54.165
unarmed, locked up with
all these murderers.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.539
It's just too much for me.

Oh, my God. Amy, go to him.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.400
- I screwed up.
- No, you didn't.

18:01.425 --> 18:02.535
I get it.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.614
Being a cop and dating a cop...

18:04.639 --> 18:06.553
It's harder than I thought it would be.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.067
I worry about you too.

18:08.092 --> 18:09.690
Oh, my God. Jake, go to her.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.614
Look, I was just trying
to keep you safe,

18:11.639 --> 18:13.549
but I wasn't letting you do your job.

18:13.574 --> 18:14.337
I'm sorry.

18:14.362 --> 18:15.786
Why aren't you going to each other?

18:15.811 --> 18:18.017
I think I have to take myself
off of this assignment.

18:18.261 --> 18:19.531
Are you sure?

18:19.555 --> 18:21.287
Absolutely. You got this.

18:21.312 --> 18:22.684
Hopefully, I haven't
already blown your cover

18:22.709 --> 18:23.709
by dragging you into my office

18:23.734 --> 18:25.085
so many times.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.986
Also, I'm pretty sure a
lot of people heard me say

18:27.011 --> 18:28.892
that your baby's blood type is "OG."

18:28.917 --> 18:30.325
Yeah, you're a pretty terrible doctor.

18:30.350 --> 18:31.364
Mm-hmm.

18:31.389 --> 18:35.083
But... I think I know how
to get things back on track.

18:35.688 --> 18:38.111
Hey, Cortez, you're late
for your appointment.

18:38.136 --> 18:39.871
Quit touching me.

Oh! Aah... ow!

- No! He's mine.

18:54.565 --> 18:56.117

Sorry that wasn't Scar-Joe.

19:02.636 --> 19:03.816
I don't want to talk about it.

19:03.841 --> 19:05.578
Talking about your
feelings is for losers.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.868
I guess Adele's a loser in your world.

19:08.350 --> 19:10.350
Look, the funeral's almost over,

19:10.375 --> 19:11.583
we basically pulled it off.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.963
All you've got to do is
give a convincing eulogy.

19:13.988 --> 19:14.988
Roger that.

19:15.013 --> 19:16.394
Pimento's dead.

19:16.419 --> 19:18.459
Thanks for coming.

19:24.936 --> 19:26.535
[sighs]

19:27.756 --> 19:30.448
Adrian Pimento was very special to me.

19:31.093 --> 19:33.208
And now he's gone.

19:33.919 --> 19:36.401
And I'm starting to realize...

19:37.696 --> 19:39.864
there's nothing I can
do to bring him back.

19:41.818 --> 19:44.293
I guess life is just
gonna suck for a while.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.223
But it's nice to know
there's a room full of people

19:49.248 --> 19:50.791
who is sucks for too.

19:51.294 --> 19:52.767
I'd also like to add...

19:52.792 --> 19:54.983
the next person who hugs me
gets their necks snapped.

19:55.008 --> 19:56.895
And... she's back.

19:57.224 --> 20:00.351
Okay, this is it, I'm leaving.

20:00.376 --> 20:01.712
You're in charge.

20:01.736 --> 20:03.343
I'll take extra good care of her, Jake.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.055
Just let her do her thing.

20:05.081 --> 20:06.709
But this is Texas, so also make sure

20:06.734 --> 20:08.469
she doesn't somehow
get the death penalty.

20:08.494 --> 20:09.604
Mm-hmm.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.782
Stay tough, Cortez.

20:11.806 --> 20:14.075
You're touching her boob.
Should I turn away, or...

20:14.100 --> 20:16.466
I'm not touching her boob.
She's tiny on the screen.

20:16.491 --> 20:17.458
I'm just saying good-bye, man.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.787
You know, why don't I
turn and give you privacy?

20:18.812 --> 20:21.163
No, don't turn. That's
what makes it weird.

You said there's nothing you
can do to bring him back,

20:34.069 --> 20:35.089
but you're wrong.

None of us are gonna stop
fighting until he comes home.

20:37.802 --> 20:39.146
Thanks.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.747
And if you ever need to talk,

20:40.772 --> 20:42.535
or get drunk,

20:42.560 --> 20:43.692
or throw stuff off a roof,

20:43.717 --> 20:45.311
I mean, I don't know your process.

20:45.337 --> 20:46.740
Am I hitting on anything here?

20:46.764 --> 20:48.001
The roof thing sounds pretty good.

20:48.026 --> 20:49.474
Very well. Let's throw
something off the roof

20:49.498 --> 20:51.067
and then we'll get back to work.

20:51.136 --> 20:52.386
High five.

I quite like them now.

21:14.687 --> 21:16.667
Maybe you should come work for me.
