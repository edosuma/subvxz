00:00.745 --> 00:02.792
Previously on <i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.817 --> 00:04.017
I don't know
what's crazy anymore.

00:04.042 --> 00:05.736
We're fighting aliens
from outer space.

00:07.126 --> 00:09.183
Skitters communicate
using radio waves --

00:09.208 --> 00:10.408
that much is clear.

00:10.433 --> 00:11.633
Pretty proud of your criminal
past, aren't you?

00:11.953 --> 00:13.153
I was good at it.

00:16.344 --> 00:17.588
He's not your son.

00:18.098 --> 00:19.298
How can we help you?

00:19.323 --> 00:20.523
Kill me.

00:23.832 --> 00:25.032
He's dead.

00:25.725 --> 00:26.925
Is it because
of the harness?

00:26.950 --> 00:28.150
Is that how they knew
that you were one of them?

00:28.736 --> 00:29.673
They're not like that.

00:29.698 --> 00:30.898
I'm going in --

00:30.923 --> 00:32.122
with Rick's harness
strapped to my back.

00:32.148 --> 00:33.348
I'm gonna pretend
to be one of them.

00:34.972 --> 00:37.006
Ben, I'm taking you home.
We're taking all of them.

00:38.743 --> 00:39.943
You saved him.

00:39.968 --> 00:41.168
Dad?

00:41.507 --> 00:42.707
It's me.

00:48.770 --> 00:50.703
Okay, Eli. Say "ahh."

00:50.738 --> 00:53.173
Ahh.

00:53.207 --> 00:54.573
Don't worry.

00:54.608 --> 00:56.743
Tongue depressors are
the first thing they teach you

00:56.777 --> 00:59.177
in medical school.

00:59.212 --> 01:02.147
When did you start
to feel this way?

01:02.181 --> 01:03.948
It's been
a couple of days.

01:03.983 --> 01:05.584
He's not eating,
can't sleep.

01:05.618 --> 01:08.222
Yeah, there's a <i>lot</i> of that
going around.

01:08.256 --> 01:10.125
This lantern's
going out again.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.494
Scott has some batteries
in the science room...

01:12.529 --> 01:14.498
And a stash of candy
in his drawer.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.903
Oh, suckers
or gummy bears?

01:16.938 --> 01:17.771
Gummy bears.

01:17.805 --> 01:19.773
Okay.

01:23.180 --> 01:27.551
Oh, it's okay.
You can leave the door open.

01:27.585 --> 01:28.686
So, his throat is clear,

01:28.720 --> 01:31.490
and his temperature's
just a hair above normal,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.593
so...

01:33.628 --> 01:36.329
What --
shut up.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.197
Go to your mother.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.598
I need antibiotics,
painkillers --

01:38.632 --> 01:40.166
everything you've got.
No.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.534
"No"?

01:41.568 --> 01:43.235
It took months
to get that stuff.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.470
People are depending
on it.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.839
I'm not here to argue!

01:45.874 --> 01:48.109
The faster we do this,
the faster we're gone.

01:48.144 --> 01:49.678
Come on!
Ohh.

01:49.712 --> 01:53.316
Oh, God.

01:53.350 --> 01:55.085
Why?

01:55.119 --> 01:57.455
You really have to ask?

01:57.489 --> 01:59.690
Skitter killed a man
right here, didn't he?

01:59.725 --> 02:02.660
Kids with spikes
still in their backs

02:02.695 --> 02:05.129
walking around
like it's normal.

02:05.164 --> 02:06.330
The chance of survival
around here is low,

02:06.365 --> 02:08.199
and it's getting lower
by the day. Come on!

02:08.233 --> 02:12.069
You can leave.
Nobody's stopping you.

02:12.104 --> 02:15.439
It's the wild west
out there.

02:15.474 --> 02:16.340
If we get into trouble,

02:16.374 --> 02:17.975
we're gonna need something
to trade.

02:23.715 --> 02:26.317
Help!
Help! In here!

02:27.619 --> 02:29.888
No more, Jeff.
Don't hurt her.

02:29.922 --> 02:33.626
No, no.

02:33.660 --> 02:35.895
I'm sorry.

02:37.664 --> 02:39.999
Come on!

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.715 --> 02:57.351
Okay.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.353
Okay. No, go this way!
This way.

03:09.864 --> 03:11.799
This is what happens
when people lose focus.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.334
They get careless.

03:13.368 --> 03:15.337
There's no way Anne
could have seen this coming.

03:15.371 --> 03:17.139
I'm not talking about Anne.
I'm talking about you.

03:17.173 --> 03:20.543
Civilians
are your responsibility.

03:20.577 --> 03:23.146
The longer
this siege goes on,

03:23.180 --> 03:25.082
the more desperate
people are gonna get.

03:26.451 --> 03:29.654
Leave us alone!
I'll shoot, I swear!

03:40.233 --> 03:43.202
No, no, hold your fire.
They've got their kid with them.

03:43.237 --> 03:48.242
J-just go back!
No one has to get hurt!

03:48.276 --> 03:50.411
Nobody's
going anywhere!

03:50.445 --> 03:54.515
You throw out that medicine,
then we'll talk.

03:56.619 --> 03:59.588
Drop it or die right now!

04:03.359 --> 04:04.727
Drop it!

04:04.761 --> 04:08.964
I-I just want to get my family
the hell away from here.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.033
Well, from what I could hear,
that's the offer on the table,

04:11.067 --> 04:14.537
as long as
you leave that behind.

04:14.571 --> 04:17.072
Who the hell
is out there?!

04:17.107 --> 04:18.774
Terry Clayton, 7th Mass!

04:21.077 --> 04:21.610
Is that Dan Weaver?!

04:21.644 --> 04:23.612
Yeah!

04:23.647 --> 04:25.681
Well, come on up!

04:31.287 --> 04:32.655
I'm gonna
give you five seconds,

04:32.689 --> 04:34.490
and then
you're dealing with them.

04:45.936 --> 04:48.370
No, no, no.
Stand down, Mike.

04:48.404 --> 04:51.140
They want to leave.

04:51.174 --> 04:52.374
They don't want to be here,
let 'em go.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.514
Still a free country,
right?

04:58.549 --> 05:00.683
Terry,
good to see you.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.319
Yeah.
Always had good timing.

05:03.353 --> 05:05.287
Mike, you're a sight.

05:05.322 --> 05:08.423
- Tom. How are the boys?
- They're good.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.425
You're a long way
from home.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.261
Last word was the 7th Mass
was holding tight

05:12.295 --> 05:13.529
outside of Wilmington.

05:15.365 --> 05:17.598
Yeah, we were.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.700
The 7th Mass is gone.

05:19.735 --> 05:21.435
It's gone?

05:21.469 --> 05:22.836
Yeah. Game's changed.

05:22.870 --> 05:25.406
Skitters hit us,
and they hit us hard.

05:26.708 --> 05:28.809
They're coming
this way next.

05:31.546 --> 05:33.748
Phillips,
my second-in-command,

05:33.782 --> 05:34.649
he -- he grabbed
his daughter Megan

05:34.683 --> 05:36.618
and tried to
pull her back,

05:36.652 --> 05:40.456
but another Skitter
came up behind him, and...

05:41.925 --> 05:44.927
Anyway...

05:44.961 --> 05:47.697
Once they had all our kids,
the Mechs just opened up.

05:47.731 --> 05:51.267
And I...I just ran.

05:51.301 --> 05:54.070
I'm never gonna forgive myself,
but that's just what I did.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.338
Terry,
what else could you do?

05:56.373 --> 05:59.742
A thousand things, probably,
but thanks.

05:59.777 --> 06:03.479
How many of you got away?

06:03.514 --> 06:05.582
Eight fighters,
half a dozen civilians.

06:05.616 --> 06:06.850
And we just kept moving

06:06.884 --> 06:10.687
until we holed up
at a farm right here --

06:10.722 --> 06:13.490
secluded, in a valley,
hills on three sides.

06:13.524 --> 06:15.692
Skitters have already
swept the area twice,

06:15.727 --> 06:17.828
so we think
we're in the clear for a while.

06:17.862 --> 06:20.564
Why do you think
they're coming this way?

06:20.598 --> 06:22.566
Re-established contact
with Porter last week.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.702
He thinks the aliens are
stepping up construction

06:25.736 --> 06:27.671
on their structures,
looking for slave labor.

06:27.705 --> 06:33.577
Skitters have been
sweeping through here and here.

06:33.611 --> 06:35.145
- Right this way.
- Yeah.

06:35.179 --> 06:36.513
We've been seeing
small patrols --

06:36.547 --> 06:38.182
one Skitter, one Mech.

06:38.216 --> 06:41.252
Pattern's been to I.D. a target,
come back full force.

06:41.286 --> 06:43.488
What are our orders?

06:43.522 --> 06:47.825
Regroup.
The 3rd Mass is right here.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.162
That is...

06:50.196 --> 06:52.130
Right in between us
and the last attack.

06:52.165 --> 06:53.632
And they're running light
on fighters and ammo.

06:53.666 --> 06:56.569
There's no way they're gonna
survive an attack on their own.

06:56.603 --> 06:58.772
Porter has ordered them
to join up with you.

06:58.806 --> 07:01.274
Now, you're to hold this
position until they arrive,

07:01.308 --> 07:03.577
and then everybody
pulls out together.

07:03.611 --> 07:05.245
How long?

07:05.279 --> 07:09.182
I'd say 72 hours,
give or take.

07:09.216 --> 07:10.049
That's a long time
to sit tight

07:10.084 --> 07:11.017
with a Skitter attack
coming our way.

07:11.051 --> 07:12.584
Yeah, that's how Porter
sees it, too.

07:12.619 --> 07:15.420
So you're supposed to send
anyone under 20 ahead with me.

07:15.454 --> 07:17.555
- With you?
- Yeah.

07:17.590 --> 07:19.390
Be safer at the farm,
and if you do have to engage,

07:19.425 --> 07:21.425
you won't have to worry
about the kids.

07:21.459 --> 07:24.094
After the 3rd
rendezvouses with you here,

07:24.128 --> 07:25.762
you're to meet us there, and...

07:25.797 --> 07:28.832
...we'll just find everybody
a new place to live.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.834
I hear what you're saying,
and I appreciate the threat,

07:30.869 --> 07:33.303
but I'm not ready
to give my kids up.

07:34.339 --> 07:35.873
I'm just
conveying the order.

07:35.908 --> 07:38.643
All right. Mike, we need to
double up on perimeter security.

07:38.677 --> 07:39.777
Dai --

07:39.812 --> 07:41.479
Bike recon. On it.

07:41.513 --> 07:43.180
You need to talk
to the parents,

07:43.215 --> 07:46.284
start preparing them,
just in case.

07:46.318 --> 07:47.251
I don't think anybody's
gonna go for this.

07:47.285 --> 07:49.119
I'm not dragging
anybody's kid away yet.

07:49.154 --> 07:51.355
But if our patrols tell us
an attack is imminent,

07:51.389 --> 07:53.624
a head start
could save lives.

07:53.658 --> 07:56.360
You might try explaining that
to these people.

07:56.395 --> 07:57.595
I'm not exactly
impartial.

07:57.629 --> 07:59.797
Which is exactly why
you're the right one to do it.

08:08.772 --> 08:10.080
I'll go out five miles.

08:10.105 --> 08:11.430
Two shots means
friendlies.

08:11.972 --> 08:13.172
- Three shots --
- Not so friendly.

08:14.721 --> 08:16.254
Good luck!

08:16.289 --> 08:18.010
Okay, the rest of you guys,
you know the drill,

08:18.011 --> 08:19.078
so spread the word.

08:19.112 --> 08:21.313
We need to prepare for
a potential fast evacuation.

08:21.347 --> 08:24.870
Let's load the vehicles with
water, ammunition, provisions --

08:24.871 --> 08:26.639
anything
we can't carry ourselves.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.273
W-what's this
about an order

08:28.308 --> 08:29.474
to send our kids out ahead of us?
A precaution.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.910
Yeah, that hasn't
been decided.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.812
- Well, maybe somebody should decide it?
- Meaning what?

08:34.317 --> 08:35.950
I'm just saying there's
another side to this.

08:35.975 --> 08:37.985
Now, look,
Skitters want kids, right?

08:38.452 --> 08:39.653
Now our kids
are a problem?

08:39.687 --> 08:41.455
Look, they're targets.
We know that.

08:41.489 --> 08:42.356
No,
we're all targets.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.857
Look...

08:43.892 --> 08:47.327
If you want to make this about
something else, go ahead.

08:47.362 --> 08:48.228
All right, but this man
lost his entire unit,

08:48.263 --> 08:49.697
and they're coming
for us next.

08:49.731 --> 08:51.565
Maybe. Or the 3rd Massachusetts
is gonna show up,

08:51.599 --> 08:53.567
and we're all gonna
walk out of here together.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.268
I hope so, all right?

08:55.303 --> 08:57.537
Because luck has been
in real short supply recently.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.306
- Hey, dad.
- Pardon me.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.223
People look pretty afraid
about this attack.

09:03.224 --> 09:04.725
- Comments like that don't help.
- Yeah.

09:04.762 --> 09:06.500
We've got enough to worry about
without scaring ourselves.

09:07.413 --> 09:08.747
- You all right?
- Yeah.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.682
Let's get started
on the barricades!

09:20.191 --> 09:24.261
Here. Make sure Sarah remembers
to take one every day.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.831
I think she can handle it.

09:26.865 --> 09:28.265
She's a good kid.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.801
She just picked
a hell of a time

09:29.835 --> 09:31.302
to be nine month's
pregnant.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.704
Well,
it could be worse.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.305
Could be twins.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.775
So you two
are good friends now?

09:36.810 --> 09:38.410
Wouldn't go that far.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.713
She could have come
to the clinic herself,

09:40.747 --> 09:42.481
but, you know,
the way things are heating up,

09:42.516 --> 09:46.051
I just...

09:46.086 --> 09:47.119
You know,
she's already on edge.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.855
I figured she didn't
need to see you like this.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.592
I heard you fought back.

09:58.229 --> 09:59.562
For all the good it did.

09:59.597 --> 10:00.863
Well,
at least you tried.

10:00.898 --> 10:02.265
You know, when you take it
lying down,

10:02.299 --> 10:04.400
it does something
to your head.

10:04.435 --> 10:05.902
It's really hard
to come back from that.

10:07.738 --> 10:10.907
Trust me.

10:12.510 --> 10:14.745
Hang on to that.

10:14.779 --> 10:16.380
Oh, n-no.

10:16.414 --> 10:19.451
You'll feel better
just knowing it's around.

10:19.485 --> 10:22.354
And if it conflicts
with some hippocratic oath,

10:22.388 --> 10:26.492
why don't you just stitch the
bad guy up <i>after</i> you blast them?

10:27.461 --> 10:30.630
It's pretty much
just point and shoot,

10:30.664 --> 10:32.264
but if you need a lesson,
I'm around.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.675
98, 99, 100,

10:42.709 --> 10:46.211
101, 102.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.881
You just did
102 push-ups!

10:48.915 --> 10:50.650
I did?

10:50.684 --> 10:54.220
Guys, enough.
I've got night sentry duty.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.888
Kind of gross, huh?

10:55.923 --> 10:58.724
Shh!

10:58.759 --> 11:00.493
Some of the other kids
you were with

11:00.527 --> 11:02.394
said that their spikes
are going away.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.162
I know. Mine aren't.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.597
Maybe it's 'cause
the others weren't there

11:05.632 --> 11:07.632
as long
as me and Rick.

11:07.666 --> 11:08.700
Do they still hurt?

11:08.734 --> 11:10.702
At first.
Not so much now.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.803
Sometimes I forget
they're even there,

11:12.837 --> 11:16.640
d then I lean the wrong way
or bend into something.

11:16.674 --> 11:18.475
Can I touch one?

11:18.509 --> 11:21.511
Sure?

11:21.546 --> 11:22.579
Aah!

11:25.516 --> 11:27.484
Are you okay?!

11:31.322 --> 11:33.356
You jerk!
That wasn't funny!

11:33.391 --> 11:35.659
Sorry, sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.900
Ben?
Mm-hmm?

11:41.934 --> 11:47.138
What was it like...
with the Skitters?

11:47.172 --> 11:48.706
What do you want to know?
How they smell?

11:48.740 --> 11:51.508
No, I'm serious!

11:51.542 --> 11:54.477
Did they talk to you?

11:54.511 --> 11:56.345
Not like you think.
It was --

11:56.379 --> 11:59.181
you don't exactly have your own
thoughts when you're with them.

11:59.215 --> 12:00.115
It's not like
you're thinking.

12:00.149 --> 12:02.251
At least not the way
you normally do, so...

12:03.486 --> 12:05.487
It's more like
someone's thinking with you.

12:05.521 --> 12:08.624
Um, remember when
we went camping with dad

12:08.659 --> 12:11.227
and you weren't
feeling well?

12:11.262 --> 12:13.397
You were hungry and you were
thirsty and your stomach hurt.

12:13.431 --> 12:15.833
Well...

12:15.867 --> 12:17.702
Imagine if dad
knew everything you wanted

12:17.736 --> 12:19.838
before you even
asked for it.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.776
You must have been scared.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.981
When they first caught me,

12:29.015 --> 12:30.716
I was never more afraid
in my entire life.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.653
But after the harness,
it wasn't so bad.

12:37.589 --> 12:40.624
Did you miss us?

12:40.658 --> 12:42.292
I don't know.

12:42.326 --> 12:46.229
In some bizarro alien way,

12:46.264 --> 12:47.865
I think the Skitters actually
cared about us, you know?

12:49.368 --> 12:53.571
They weren't monsters.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.274
There were our family.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.712
I know it sounds weird,
but...

13:00.224 --> 13:02.025
Sometimes
I still miss that.

13:22.363 --> 13:24.397
You know, I'm not sure what
scares me more sometimes --

13:24.422 --> 13:26.090
Weaver or the Skitters.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.825
He's a hard man to like,
but he <i>is</i> trying to protect us.

13:28.860 --> 13:30.360
Fighters, maybe.

13:30.395 --> 13:32.195
He's had a problem
with the civvies from day one.

13:32.230 --> 13:33.597
I don't care
what's coming,

13:33.631 --> 13:35.966
they're <i>not</i>
taking my daughter from me.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.768
Get away from that door.

13:40.372 --> 13:43.140
You all right, Doc?

13:43.174 --> 13:45.109
Yeah.
I'm -- I'm fine.

13:45.144 --> 13:46.277
You're all done.

13:46.312 --> 13:47.612
Just keep it clean,

13:47.646 --> 13:48.780
and I'm gonna check on it
in a couple days.

13:48.814 --> 13:50.515
Thanks.

13:50.549 --> 13:52.517
Come on, sweetie.

13:52.551 --> 13:54.986
My turn?

13:55.020 --> 13:56.220
Were you waiting
out there?

13:56.255 --> 13:57.889
Yeah. You got a sec?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.424
Just.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.293
Stress level in camp's
hitting 10.

14:01.327 --> 14:03.295
I've seen bumps and cuts --
you name it.

14:03.329 --> 14:05.164
You all right?
You're not sick?

14:05.865 --> 14:06.598
No, no, no.
No, I'm fine.

14:06.632 --> 14:09.200
It's just, uh...

14:09.235 --> 14:11.503
Um...

14:11.537 --> 14:15.541
You can think of me
as your doctor, if you want.

14:15.575 --> 14:16.309
Anything you say
stays between us.

14:20.047 --> 14:21.581
It's Ben.

14:21.616 --> 14:23.216
Something's up with him.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.059
You know, I mean,

14:25.060 --> 14:26.654
I know what all he's been
through and everything.

14:26.706 --> 14:28.273
And it's not that.
It's like...

14:29.390 --> 14:31.624
He's just not acting
like himself.

14:31.658 --> 14:33.259
Like how?

14:33.293 --> 14:35.928
Like he just did 100 push-ups
without breaking a sweat.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.997
I mean, he'd have been lucky
to hit 10 before the attack.

14:39.032 --> 14:45.305
We don't know what they had
him doing all those months.

14:45.339 --> 14:45.371
No, I know.

14:48.576 --> 14:49.777
It's just, uh...

14:49.811 --> 14:52.313
It's just hard to explain it
if you didn't know him before.

14:52.348 --> 14:55.551
He was, um...

14:55.585 --> 14:57.787
my bratty little brother.

14:57.821 --> 14:59.555
You know?

14:59.589 --> 15:02.491
He was my bratty little brother
that was twice as smart as me.

15:02.525 --> 15:05.894
And now...he's like...

15:05.929 --> 15:09.565
A grown-up?

15:09.933 --> 15:12.334
No, he...

15:12.369 --> 15:15.604
A different kid.

15:15.638 --> 15:17.205
Green light!

15:17.239 --> 15:19.607
Red light!

15:19.642 --> 15:20.608
Green light!

15:20.643 --> 15:22.744
Red light!

15:22.778 --> 15:25.413
One of the upsides of losing our
electronics -- no video games.

15:25.447 --> 15:28.751
Got to make do with
old-fashioned imagination.

15:28.785 --> 15:30.319
How are you feeling?

15:30.353 --> 15:31.687
You should see
the other guy.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.923
Sorry that I didn't
come by last night.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.392
Things got
a little crazy.

15:35.426 --> 15:37.728
I know.

15:40.699 --> 15:42.400
Oh,
I always hated moving.

15:42.434 --> 15:43.568
I don't see Ben.

15:43.603 --> 15:46.805
Well,
he's inside someplace.

15:46.839 --> 15:50.208
Either packing or probably got
his nose stuck in a book. Why?

15:50.242 --> 15:51.376
Well, I'm his doctor.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.911
Doctors are supposed to
follow up.

15:53.946 --> 15:54.956
How does he seem to you?

15:54.957 --> 15:56.962
He seems 14, a little shy.

15:58.116 --> 16:01.051
I need you two to help me
with the barricade in the back.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.719
I'm glad. Let's get started
on that other one, too.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.573
Yeah, yeah, we're on it.

16:03.598 --> 16:04.798
- What?
- I'm glad.

16:06.224 --> 16:08.859
Do you think they can, uh --
do you think we can stop them?

16:08.893 --> 16:10.893
No, this is all about
just slowing them down,

16:10.928 --> 16:12.495
buying us enough time

16:12.529 --> 16:13.830
that we can get everybody out
through the tunnel.

16:13.864 --> 16:17.133
Hold that.

16:21.205 --> 16:22.238
Phew.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.608
What about
Clayton's offer?

16:24.642 --> 16:26.276
You're thinking about it,
aren't you?

16:26.310 --> 16:28.444
I'm trying not to.

16:30.147 --> 16:33.249
See, the thing is,
I can't figure out

16:33.283 --> 16:35.718
if I'm resisting because
I want to protect my kids

16:35.752 --> 16:37.420
or if I'm just
being selfish

16:37.454 --> 16:40.590
because
I want to keep them close.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.459
Tom, if --
if it doesn't feel right...

16:42.494 --> 16:46.097
Well, that's what makes this
so hard.

16:46.131 --> 16:49.333
I honestly don't know.

16:52.071 --> 16:55.140
All right,
why don't we head over there?

16:55.174 --> 16:57.776
How many people have we got
to handle perimeter patrols?

16:57.810 --> 16:58.543
Enough, barely.

16:58.578 --> 16:59.611
We were 12 hours on,
12 off.

16:59.645 --> 17:02.147
We still couldn't cover
all the access points.

17:03.463 --> 17:06.031
What do you need,
Jimmy?

17:06.085 --> 17:08.420
I-I want you to put me
back in the rotation.

17:09.421 --> 17:11.356
I heard you talking.
You're short-handed.

17:11.390 --> 17:13.258
Kid, there's plenty of
non-combat work to be done

17:13.291 --> 17:15.059
before we're
ready to move.

17:15.094 --> 17:16.394
I'm not like
all the other kids.

17:16.428 --> 17:17.796
Y-you don't
need to send me away.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.432
I can take care
of myself.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.137
I'll tell you what, Jimmy.

17:26.172 --> 17:29.073
Parker's all alone out
at South post tonight.

17:29.108 --> 17:31.542
I'm sure
he could use some company.

17:31.576 --> 17:33.810
Y-yes, sir.

17:36.647 --> 17:38.147
He's a good kid.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.918
Yeah, and he should be
in junior high school

17:41.952 --> 17:42.885
with his arm
around a cheerleader,

17:42.920 --> 17:46.189
not fighting a damn war,
but there it is.

17:46.223 --> 17:51.328
I think I'm gonna go find
some more crates.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.128
You're gonna be okay.

17:53.465 --> 17:55.833
I'm supposed to be the one
taking care of you.

18:24.194 --> 18:26.696
Damn it.

18:28.199 --> 18:29.667
See?

18:29.701 --> 18:31.229
It's just like that,

18:32.074 --> 18:33.274
only a lot louder.

18:36.708 --> 18:39.277
Shouldn't I, I don't know,
like, take a stance?

18:39.311 --> 18:41.212
You're not the Terminator,
honey.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.347
You're just looking
to protect yourself.

18:43.382 --> 18:44.682
That's it.

18:44.716 --> 18:48.619
Keep your wrist loose
'cause this sucker's got kick.

18:48.653 --> 18:51.087
Where should I aim?

18:51.122 --> 18:52.255
In front of you.

18:52.290 --> 18:55.425
Okay.

18:57.127 --> 18:58.594
I'm sorry.
It's not easy.

18:58.628 --> 19:03.466
I never said it was.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.400
At least,
not the first time.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.469
Yeah, just imagine that some --
you know,

19:06.503 --> 19:09.305
someone or something
is coming at you.

19:09.340 --> 19:12.876
Imagine that someone you love
is about --

19:14.179 --> 19:16.247
There you go.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.616
Oh!
Ah!

19:18.651 --> 19:19.617
Oh.

19:19.652 --> 19:22.787
It's not bad, right?

19:22.822 --> 19:25.990
Okay. Do it again.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.194
I never liked guns.

19:30.228 --> 19:30.861
Neither did I.

19:30.896 --> 19:33.063
And after a couple months,

19:33.097 --> 19:34.898
it's as comfortable
as a credit card.

19:37.568 --> 19:39.235
Don't leave home
without it.

19:43.339 --> 19:46.441
I can only tell you
what's worked for us.

19:46.475 --> 19:51.045
I don't have kids,

19:51.080 --> 19:52.147
so I can't even pretend
to understand how you feel

19:52.181 --> 19:54.382
especially now,
when you've got all these people

19:54.417 --> 19:56.384
thinking that our kids
are the enemy!

19:56.419 --> 19:58.220
No, you see, <i>you've</i> got them
thinking that.

19:58.255 --> 20:00.256
I'm trying to get them to think
about the safety of their kids

20:00.290 --> 20:02.425
instead
of their own comfort.

20:02.459 --> 20:03.560
This is a temporary measure,
folks, until --

20:03.594 --> 20:06.730
Until what? We're attacked?
Then what, Terry?

20:06.764 --> 20:09.102
You think the Skitters
are just gonna give us a pass?

20:09.103 --> 20:10.337
- I never said that!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:10.434 --> 20:12.502
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?

20:13.538 --> 20:17.608
I know that a lot of you
have lost your children.

20:17.643 --> 20:19.711
Okay, don't think that my heart
doesn't break for you.

20:19.745 --> 20:22.380
But please imagine
that you still have your child.

20:22.415 --> 20:24.415
Would you let <i>anyone</i>
take them away from you?

20:24.450 --> 20:26.317
Hey, that hasn't
been decided yet.

20:26.351 --> 20:29.853
Everybody here wants the same
thing -- our kids to be safe.

20:29.888 --> 20:31.455
They'll never be safe!

20:31.489 --> 20:34.024
Safe is over!

20:34.058 --> 20:35.258
We could die any day.

20:35.292 --> 20:38.428
And if that day comes, I'm gonna
be by my daughter's side.

20:38.462 --> 20:39.825
I don't want anybody to die.
This is about what

20:39.826 --> 20:41.654
it's gonna take to survive.
Yeah?

20:41.664 --> 20:42.797
Well, I swear to God,

20:42.832 --> 20:45.167
anybody tries
to take my little girl --

20:45.201 --> 20:47.035
Hey, don't you forget
who the enemy is.

20:50.506 --> 20:53.408
Everyone here
has had to make hard choices

20:53.443 --> 20:55.304
just to make it this far.

20:55.305 --> 20:56.806
And we're gonna make more.

20:56.847 --> 20:59.715
But if we fall apart now

20:59.749 --> 21:00.783
and we start
turning on each other,

21:00.817 --> 21:02.151
then it doesn't matter
when the attack comes

21:02.186 --> 21:04.420
'cause we've already lost.

21:04.455 --> 21:07.991
And who's gonna decide
what we do if they attack?

21:08.025 --> 21:11.494
Weaver?!
No. <i>I</i> will.

21:43.086 --> 21:43.986
Hey!

21:44.020 --> 21:46.889
Take it easy, Parker.
It's just me.

21:48.358 --> 21:50.659
Look who's got a gun.

21:55.381 --> 21:57.292
It's pretty creepy
out here, huh?

21:57.321 --> 21:58.421
Yeah.

21:58.456 --> 22:00.790
That's the feeling
of Skitters coming our way.

22:00.825 --> 22:03.393
Yeah. I was, uh --
I was talking about you.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.100
You can pick up
where O'Neil left off.

22:10.134 --> 22:12.769
O'Neil plays for crap.

22:18.509 --> 22:20.443
U sure
you want to do that?

22:20.478 --> 22:21.712
Checkmate in three.

22:40.363 --> 22:41.363
- That's Mech fire.
- Where?

22:41.397 --> 22:42.998
I don't know,
but that's close.

22:43.032 --> 22:45.667
They're here!

22:45.701 --> 22:46.701
Keep it together!
Everybody stay inside!

22:46.736 --> 22:50.070
If you get the order to move,
get ready to move.

22:50.105 --> 22:51.372
[ Metal creaking

23:08.959 --> 23:10.960
Parker?

23:10.994 --> 23:12.228
Parker!

23:12.262 --> 23:14.430
Parker! Aah!

23:55.972 --> 23:57.339
South?!
I think so.

23:57.373 --> 24:00.242
Jimmy went out tonight,
South post!

24:00.944 --> 24:03.478
Mech!
There's a Mech!

24:03.513 --> 24:05.481
Somebody!

24:08.251 --> 24:09.117
Mech!

24:23.832 --> 24:24.531
No!

24:24.565 --> 24:28.001
Mech!

24:28.035 --> 24:28.568
Mech!

24:39.115 --> 24:41.817
Clayton, Mike,
go find the Mech!

24:44.921 --> 24:47.890
Jimmy! Jimmy!

24:51.962 --> 24:53.062
Any sign of him?

24:53.096 --> 24:54.430
No.

25:08.378 --> 25:09.645
Skitter!

25:13.416 --> 25:15.083
The Mech's
retreating!

25:15.118 --> 25:16.418
Skitter! Help!

25:16.452 --> 25:18.653
That's coming from inside.

25:18.687 --> 25:20.355
Fighters got the Mech.
Let's go!

25:20.389 --> 25:21.188
Skitter!

25:28.729 --> 25:32.031
Take the hall.
Go. Go!

25:32.366 --> 25:33.399
Skitter!

25:49.083 --> 25:50.984
Come on!

26:15.378 --> 26:18.246
Jimmy?

26:20.015 --> 26:21.816
Jimmy.

26:24.886 --> 26:27.320
Come here.

26:28.356 --> 26:30.390
Are you all right?

26:31.392 --> 26:33.760
Whoa.

26:33.795 --> 26:38.632
It's okay.

26:38.667 --> 26:41.135
It's okay, son.

26:41.170 --> 26:43.338
It's all right now.

26:45.208 --> 26:47.943
It's all right.

26:49.705 --> 26:51.705
And I was running.
And it was right behind me.

26:51.832 --> 26:53.066
And I went inside, and I --

26:53.091 --> 26:54.679
Steady.
Let me check you out.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.869
I-I-I knew I had to
pull out the gun,

26:56.903 --> 26:58.564
so I pulled it out,
and I fired -- bang, bang, bang.

26:58.565 --> 26:59.337
And I was out of bullets.

26:59.338 --> 27:01.576
And then I --
I can't stop talking.

27:02.608 --> 27:04.642
Am I in shock?
I bet I'm in shock.

27:04.677 --> 27:06.444
Well, if you were
a little older,

27:06.479 --> 27:08.427
we'd give you some whiskey.
Oh.

27:08.428 --> 27:09.506
I can't --

27:09.507 --> 27:11.394
It's okay.
Just take it easy.

27:12.288 --> 27:14.156
I'm telling you, we got lucky
taking out that Mech.

27:14.553 --> 27:17.522
Damn lucky. Any more
patrol ships, signs of Skitters?

27:17.556 --> 27:18.890
Not yet.

27:18.924 --> 27:20.851
Well, we might have
dodged a bullet on that one,

27:20.852 --> 27:23.101
at least long enough
for the 3rd Mass to get to us.

27:24.763 --> 27:25.829
Yeah. Same thing happened
with the 7th.

27:25.864 --> 27:27.531
One Skitter, one Mech.

27:27.565 --> 27:29.966
Scout patrol
sniffing us out.

27:31.769 --> 27:34.504
How long
till the next wave?

27:34.538 --> 27:35.838
Long as it takes them
to figure out

27:35.872 --> 27:38.807
that Skitter's not coming back.
Right.

27:41.378 --> 27:44.847
We need to reconsider
Clayton's safe haven.

27:44.881 --> 27:47.016
This Skitter attack
isn't theoretical anymore.

27:47.050 --> 27:49.485
I know.

27:58.295 --> 28:00.496
Why don't you take one
and get out of here?

28:00.531 --> 28:01.930
What's your problem?

28:01.965 --> 28:03.844
I'm not standing in line
with this razor-back.

28:04.507 --> 28:06.446
Ones like him are the reason
the Skitters a coming.

28:06.661 --> 28:08.146
I'm gonna
check on your brother.

28:08.538 --> 28:09.605
Which one?

28:09.639 --> 28:10.973
The one about to get
his ass kicked.

28:11.007 --> 28:12.007
Hey,
take what you want.

28:12.042 --> 28:14.576
Hey.
You got a problem?

28:14.611 --> 28:15.411
No problem.

28:15.445 --> 28:16.845
Just glad
we're not bringing

28:16.880 --> 28:18.680
these harnessed kids
back to the 2nd Mass.

28:18.715 --> 28:19.982
Oh,
nobody's stopping anything.

28:20.016 --> 28:21.951
Soon as we get the drugs
Dr. Glass needs,

28:21.985 --> 28:23.887
we're gonna rescue
as many of them as we can.

28:23.888 --> 28:25.721
You're just inviting
a Skitter attack.

28:26.190 --> 28:28.653
See, the Skitters
should know by now --

28:28.994 --> 28:30.910
anybody that messes
with our families

28:30.912 --> 28:34.318
gets their asses kicked...
By me.

28:35.366 --> 28:38.801
All right.
All right.

28:55.384 --> 28:58.353
Dad?
Hey. Hi.

28:58.387 --> 29:00.488
What are you
looking for?

29:00.522 --> 29:02.957
Oh, a necklace that belonged
to your mother.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.392
Gonna wear it?

29:04.426 --> 29:06.861
No, I'm just making sure
it doesn't get lost

29:06.896 --> 29:08.330
if we have to move fast.

29:08.364 --> 29:11.299
Dad, listen, um...

29:11.334 --> 29:13.602
I-it's okay.

29:13.636 --> 29:15.671
I want to go.

29:15.705 --> 29:17.339
Go where?

29:17.373 --> 29:18.607
With that guy, Clayton.

29:18.641 --> 29:21.896
Um, you're worried about
what could happen to us

29:21.963 --> 29:23.083
if the Skitters come --

29:23.447 --> 29:25.715
because of what they did
to me.

29:25.749 --> 29:27.016
Now, Ben --

29:27.051 --> 29:28.785
you have to be ready to fight
if they come.

29:28.819 --> 29:32.556
You can't do that, not really,
if we're here.

29:32.590 --> 29:36.861
I've been thinking about
something you told us

29:36.895 --> 29:37.528
about
World War II England.

29:37.562 --> 29:41.165
During the Blitz.

29:41.199 --> 29:43.200
Yeah, the, um -- the Germans
were bombing London, right?

29:43.235 --> 29:44.202
Yep, and the English
sent their kids

29:44.236 --> 29:46.737
away to the country
to keep them safe

29:46.772 --> 29:48.072
while the parents
stayed behind.

29:48.107 --> 29:49.941
I'm not sure that
this is the same thing.

29:49.976 --> 29:52.143
Well, nothing is.

30:05.826 --> 30:08.829
I want to ask you
a question,

30:08.863 --> 30:12.700
and I want the truth.

30:13.836 --> 30:16.872
Are you...

30:18.474 --> 30:21.376
Are you happy
that you're back?

30:21.410 --> 30:24.045
Of course.

30:24.079 --> 30:26.748
Um...

30:26.782 --> 30:27.782
A-are you glad
you found me?

30:28.951 --> 30:32.020
More than
you'll ever know.

30:32.054 --> 30:36.224
Then let us do this
for you.

30:50.637 --> 30:52.738
Everybody!

30:58.777 --> 31:00.378
I've decided
to send Matt and Ben

31:00.413 --> 31:02.480
along with
Lieutenant Clayton.

31:02.514 --> 31:04.616
It'll put our kids
a few hours ahead

31:04.651 --> 31:05.684
of whatever else is coming,

31:05.719 --> 31:07.720
and I think that
that's a good thing.

31:07.754 --> 31:11.123
By tomorrow, the 3rd
Massachusetts will be here.

31:11.158 --> 31:12.425
And if everything
goes as planned,

31:12.459 --> 31:14.727
we'll be reuniting with our kids
by tomorrow night.

31:14.761 --> 31:17.430
We just got hit
by a Skitter.

31:17.465 --> 31:19.566
If they're still out there,
how are you gonna get through?

31:19.600 --> 31:21.368
We're a small group,
on foot.

31:21.403 --> 31:23.604
We'll be ahead
of the main Skitter force.

31:23.638 --> 31:25.506
We'll be
way under their radar.

31:25.540 --> 31:27.642
If you're not?

31:27.676 --> 31:28.810
And they're gonna have
a security detachment with them.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.613
O'Brian, Fuller.

31:31.648 --> 31:34.450
I'd like Mike to come, too,
if that's all right.

31:34.484 --> 31:36.586
We go back.

31:36.620 --> 31:39.455
Okay.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.557
We know the Skitters aren't
after the youngest ones.

31:41.591 --> 31:44.393
The rest will go because
our kids are our future,

31:44.427 --> 31:47.796
and their safety
has got to come first.

31:47.830 --> 31:50.832
So pack them up.
They leave in an hour.

32:06.052 --> 32:07.957
That's six flags?

32:07.958 --> 32:10.627
Where did you get that?

32:10.661 --> 32:13.330
Had it on me
when the Skitters took me.

32:13.364 --> 32:15.499
They didn't take it.
Forgot I even had it.

32:16.802 --> 32:20.103
Remember that day?

32:20.138 --> 32:22.672
Remember?
You threw up on me.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.241
Then Matt threw up on me.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.944
It was one of the most memorable
days of my life.

32:26.978 --> 32:28.212
At least dad
didn't throw up on you.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.648
I don't know, he was looking a little
green at that supersonic.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.818
You look like her.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.755
That's what
everybody always said.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.559
Take it.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.129
Why?

32:45.163 --> 32:48.232
Hold on to it for me,
till you come back for us.

33:02.612 --> 33:04.880
Hi, dad.

33:04.914 --> 33:06.581
Hey. Thought you weren't
on sentry duty until tonight.

33:06.616 --> 33:11.153
Actually, I, um, got Ryerson
to take my watch.

33:11.188 --> 33:12.688
What's going on?

33:12.723 --> 33:14.324
I've been thinking,
you know,

33:14.358 --> 33:18.162
maybe I should go
with Matt and Ben.

33:18.196 --> 33:20.698
I'm worried about them,
too.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.533
But I think
between Mike and the escort,

33:22.568 --> 33:24.635
they'll be well-protected.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.739
Oh, it's no big secret that Ben
and I never really got along.

33:27.774 --> 33:31.810
Fought like cats and dogs
is more like it.

33:31.844 --> 33:32.911
But brothers
are like that.

33:32.945 --> 33:36.247
That morning, um, you were,
you know, still asleep,

33:36.281 --> 33:39.483
but -- but Ben and I
got into it.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.285
You know,
the morning mom went out

33:42.320 --> 33:45.855
to get food
with Dr. Harris.

33:45.890 --> 33:48.724
I didn't know that.

33:48.759 --> 33:49.458
No big deal.

33:49.493 --> 33:52.528
You know, she just, uh,

33:52.563 --> 33:54.797
she broke us up
like she always did.

33:54.832 --> 33:55.565
But she told me
something --

33:55.599 --> 33:57.233
that she knew
we were different,

33:57.268 --> 33:59.203
and that'd probably
never change,

33:59.237 --> 34:02.506
but, you know, we had to
put that behind us.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.242
We had to start
looking out for each other.

34:07.247 --> 34:08.614
That sounds like her.

34:08.648 --> 34:11.382
When we got Ben back,
I...

34:13.953 --> 34:18.524
I felt like I, uh,
kept this promise to her.

34:18.558 --> 34:21.994
I think if she was here
right now, you know,

34:22.027 --> 34:22.828
she'd -- she'd want me
to go with them.

34:24.297 --> 34:27.399
You sure about this?

34:27.434 --> 34:30.502
I am.

34:38.813 --> 34:41.614
Your mom
was very proud of you.

34:43.485 --> 34:45.585
She told me to keep an eye
on you, too.

34:45.621 --> 34:48.290
How's that going?

34:48.324 --> 34:51.493
It's a work in progress.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.700
I'm gonna come for you
as soon as I can.

34:57.734 --> 35:00.003
I promise.

35:08.746 --> 35:11.448
I-I just
wanted to say thanks --

35:11.482 --> 35:14.017
for giving me
another chance.

35:17.322 --> 35:19.056
You stay frosty,
soldier.

35:24.261 --> 35:26.362
So, you want to go west to here.
You want to skirt this road.

35:26.396 --> 35:28.130
Stay away from the river,
of course.

35:28.164 --> 35:31.466
And you're gonna come through
here, and we're right there.

35:31.501 --> 35:33.302
Okay.
Mm.

35:33.336 --> 35:35.604
Got it. Wait for us.
We'll be there.

35:35.638 --> 35:37.440
See you soon.
Good luck.

35:37.474 --> 35:39.342
Thank you. Let's go.

35:41.479 --> 35:43.614
Here.

35:43.648 --> 35:45.616
I told you
to hold on to this.

35:45.650 --> 35:47.684
Well, I decided
to come with you.

35:47.719 --> 35:50.521
You might as well hang on to it
yourself, dumbass.

35:50.555 --> 35:54.324
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

35:54.358 --> 35:58.461
I'll get 'em there and stay
with 'em until you can catch up.

35:58.495 --> 36:00.397
I don't want to go, Dad.
I know you don't,

36:00.431 --> 36:03.132
but it's just gonna be
for a few days, maybe less.

36:03.166 --> 36:04.600
It's gonna get better.

36:04.634 --> 36:05.834
"It's gonna get better"?

36:05.869 --> 36:07.804
That's the best advice
a college professor can pull up?

36:07.805 --> 36:09.066
It's the best I've got
right now.

36:09.238 --> 36:11.606
Be safe. I love you.

36:14.809 --> 36:17.344
All right. On me.

36:28.655 --> 36:31.090
Okay.

37:20.406 --> 37:23.509
All right, we're gonna
go up through here.

37:23.543 --> 37:25.411
Stay on the path.

37:25.445 --> 37:27.148
- Lieutenant Clayton.
- Yeah?

37:27.577 --> 37:29.184
Aren't we supposed to
turn north right her

37:29.519 --> 37:31.470
No, we're gonna
turn here instead.

37:31.471 --> 37:33.081
I mean, I don't want to take
the crossing with all the kids.

37:33.082 --> 37:34.410
Do you?

37:34.411 --> 37:36.264
Go through here,
we get to stay in the woods.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.467
All right. Cool.

37:56.454 --> 37:58.422
Everything all right?

38:12.836 --> 38:14.570
How you doing?

38:22.844 --> 38:24.912
All right.

38:24.946 --> 38:26.947
Good work.

38:26.981 --> 38:28.282
Let's get everybody to bed,

38:28.316 --> 38:30.418
and we'll do the tour
in the morning.

38:30.452 --> 38:32.587
Through here.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.410
Hello, Eli.

38:57.445 --> 39:01.214
Where are my mom and dad?

39:01.248 --> 39:02.248
The man who found us
said I could see them today.

39:02.283 --> 39:04.416
Oh, you can see them right now,
if you like.

39:06.186 --> 39:09.521
All right.

39:13.426 --> 39:16.162
Here,
let me take that for you.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.409
My name's Megan.

39:28.444 --> 39:30.045
What's yours?

39:31.347 --> 39:33.948
Eli.

39:33.983 --> 39:36.884
Eli.

39:36.919 --> 39:40.220
I really like your name,
Eli.

39:40.255 --> 39:43.123
I can take you
to your family, Eli.

39:49.130 --> 39:50.330
I --
that -- that's okay.

39:50.364 --> 39:52.165
I don't need to see them
right now.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.767
We could go
in the morning.

39:54.802 --> 39:55.535
It's better if we go now.

39:55.569 --> 39:57.237
They're waiting for you,
Eli.

39:57.271 --> 40:00.440
I don't want to!

40:15.091 --> 40:15.691
You're late.

40:15.726 --> 40:17.727
You have to be
somewhere?

40:17.761 --> 40:20.363
Yes.
How many did you get?

40:20.397 --> 40:23.700
Enough.

40:23.734 --> 40:24.868
We done here?

40:24.902 --> 40:27.437
Yes.

40:27.471 --> 40:28.138
And you'll bring more
in two days?

40:28.172 --> 40:30.106
That's the deal.

41:10.985 --> 41:15.522
Well, it turns out
you weren't lying after all.

41:15.556 --> 41:19.526
There were a lot of kids
in that school.

41:19.561 --> 41:22.696
I half expected
to find the place empty.

41:25.834 --> 41:29.936
I knew it was a good idea
to keep you alive, Pope.
