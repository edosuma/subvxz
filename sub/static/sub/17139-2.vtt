00:07.440 --> 00:08.930
- Lucifer is gone.
- To where?

00:09.200 --> 00:10.964
- I don't know.
- <i>Lucifer's running.</i>

00:11.280 --> 00:13.806
- Cause he's weak.
- Hell will never follow you.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.126
You gave me what I needed most.
I wanna do the same for you.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.321
Mom?

00:21.920 --> 00:24.287
Toni Bevell, Men of Letters,
London Chapterhouse.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.010
- Where's Dean?
- Dead.

00:26.600 --> 00:27.601
Put the gun down.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.364
TONY: <i> I need you to give me names.</i>

00:31.920 --> 00:33.968
And locations and everything else.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.971
Screw you.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.444
Are you really gonna make me do this?

00:44.280 --> 00:46.408
You know what they say.
Good things come to those...

00:46.680 --> 00:47.806
Thanks, Mom.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.122
We stop trying to break his body.
We break his mind.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.926
Maybe you're not
as good at your job as you think.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.121
No!

01:00.320 --> 01:01.321
No!

01:15.160 --> 01:16.161
Wow.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.490
Isn't this much more pleasant, Sam?

01:22.720 --> 01:25.087
I gotta say, I did not see that happening.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.923
Well, you know what they say.
"Opposites attract."

01:34.680 --> 01:36.489
Oh, we'll get there, Sam.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.283
Just another couple of questions.

01:40.680 --> 01:41.681
Hmm.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.769
Fascinating. But surely, you exaggerate.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.169
American hunters
can't be as bad as you say.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.767
Yeah, yeah, they can.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.641
- What, they're not, in the UK?
- No.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.966
No, they work for us. Tools.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.044
They kill. They don't think.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.561
Huh.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.728
Who recruited you and your brother?

02:13.680 --> 02:15.409
And to whom do you report?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.561
We, uh...

02:27.440 --> 02:29.408
We're not just
gonna talk all night, right?

02:29.640 --> 02:31.290
I haven't found anything
on these surveillance cameras.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.090
I mean, it's like they just disappeared.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.410
<i>How about you? Any of the local beat cops
see anybody that shouldn't be there?</i>

02:36.640 --> 02:40.247
It's pretty rural.
Not a lot of "beat cops."

02:40.760 --> 02:43.889
<i>I've checked all the motels,
abandoned buildings.</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:47.402
<i>- There's no sign of Sam.</i>
- All right.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.681
I don't know, you know,
check real estate offices.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.842
<i>See if anybody bought a place,
or rented a place.</i>

02:56.080 --> 02:58.845
I mean, these people had a freakin' plane.
Maybe they do things legit.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.130
Okay. I understand.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.962
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Oh, Cass, hey.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.291
<i>So, here's the thing.</i>

03:06.960 --> 03:10.442
It's been kinda weird here,
with, you know...

03:11.200 --> 03:13.931
Mom being back. It's like we
don't know how to act around each other.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.050
So, we just kinda
make this small talk and act normal.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.123
But, it's so not normal.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.922
I'm... I'm not sure.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.044
- What... What has she said to you?
- DEAN: <i>Well, nothing.</i>

03:25.360 --> 03:27.283
<i>I mean, that... That's the whole point.</i>

03:27.480 --> 03:28.845
Okay, well, what have you said to her?

03:29.080 --> 03:31.651
Well, nothing.
I don't know what to say to her, you know.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.810
It's... It's like it's all just too much.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.691
And I don't want to overwhelm her.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.605
Don't make things needlessly complicated
as you humans tend to do.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.170
- <i>I'll call you.</i>
- Yeah.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.085
Great. That's helpful. Thanks.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.001
Any news on Sam?

03:53.520 --> 03:56.490
Um... So, somewhere outside here.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.489
Somewhere outside of Aldrich, Missouri.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.320
Cass is goin' through it
with a fine-toothed comb.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.007
And I've cracked every database I could.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.641
Every what?

04:07.600 --> 04:08.601
Right.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.326
No Internet your first time around.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.489
Our house didn't have
an electric typewriter.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.767
So, are you really
afraid of overwhelming me?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.207
Mom, look, I am...

04:31.200 --> 04:33.362
Thrilled that you're back.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.364
I mean, I am so damn happy
I can't even stand it.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.320
I just...
It's just gonna take me a second...

04:42.600 --> 04:44.807
- To catch up, you know.
- Yeah. No, no.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.725
Look, take... Take all the time you need.
All right?

04:47.960 --> 04:50.804
It's... It is what it is.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.284
And when we do find Sam...

04:59.160 --> 05:00.650
How am I gonna face him?

05:03.120 --> 05:04.121
What do you mean?

05:06.280 --> 05:09.966
That yellow-eyed thing would never
have come for him that night, if I...

05:13.560 --> 05:16.245
I started all of this.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.241
It's just surprising that,
for all your efforts,

05:27.440 --> 05:31.889
yours and all the hunters,
monsters remain rampant in this country.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.485
Yeah. We just, uh...
Just keep plugging away, I guess.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.088
Do you ever think...
And don't take this the wrong way.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.410
That some of your soldiers may
have been compromised or bought?

05:49.640 --> 05:50.926
I mean...

05:52.440 --> 05:54.249
No, I don't, um...

05:54.560 --> 05:55.561
Is everything all right?

05:55.840 --> 05:57.490
TONI: <i>Is everything all right?</i>

05:58.360 --> 06:00.249
SAM: <i>No!</i>
TONY. <i>Is everything all right?</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:06.806
Is everything all right?

06:08.760 --> 06:11.889
- <i>Is everything all right?</i>
- No.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.121
No!

06:14.120 --> 06:17.761
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't be talking to you.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.964
You'll have to admit,
it was fun while it lasted.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.166
What did you do to me?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.165
An hallucination.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.404
Created by potion and powerful spell work.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.723
So, was it good for you?

06:45.360 --> 06:46.361
Hmm.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.410
Sadly, I can't do the spell again.
Your brain would liquefy.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.168
Which we don't want. Yet.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.321
So...

06:56.720 --> 07:01.328
I'll have to resort to
less pleasant methods.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.566
Enhanced interrogation was
never part of my job description.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.770
But, as it turns out...

07:35.920 --> 07:37.206
I'm a quick study.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.166
How'd you sleep?

07:51.240 --> 07:52.765
I had dreams all night.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.727
Good dreams?

07:56.360 --> 07:59.887
Stuff I'd forgotten about.
Funny stuff your dad did.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.045
He was a great father.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.241
Hey, Cass. What do you got?

08:10.640 --> 08:12.642
I think I may have found Sam's location.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.126
It's a farm. It appears empty.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.002
<i>But it was rented two weeks ago
to a woman with an English accent.</i>

08:20.240 --> 08:21.241
Did you have you had a look inside?

08:21.560 --> 08:24.564
No. No, it's... It's powerfully warded.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.251
"Powerfully warded."

08:26.640 --> 08:29.246
Okay. See, buddy,
that was your headline right there.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.929
Are we still discussing the same thing?

08:34.840 --> 08:36.808
- Where are you?
- CASTIEL: <i>I'll text you the address.</i>

08:37.120 --> 08:38.724
Okay. Got it. I'm on my way.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.601
I'll get my coat.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.490
Wait. Uh... Oh.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.761
Okay.

08:46.680 --> 08:47.966
Why don't I take this one solo, okay?

08:48.200 --> 08:49.964
We just... We don't know
what we're walking into here.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.884
We never know. We're hunters.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.964
Right. Um, okay.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.124
I... I can't do my job
if I'm worried about you.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.321
Dean?

09:04.120 --> 09:06.726
You won't have to be. I can handle myself.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.563
Okay? All right. Good talk.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.841
Oh, boy...

09:16.960 --> 09:19.725
Good morning, Sam.
Let's start again, shall we?

09:20.360 --> 09:23.045
Take our time. I've cleared my calendar.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.040
<i>I would like...</i>

09:27.920 --> 09:30.764
Names and locations of every hunter.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.281
The passcodes to each and every
Men of Letters database held in the bunker

09:35.480 --> 09:38.006
and then... Well, yes.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.442
Let's do discuss your relationship
with the demon Ruby.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.850
- Mick?
- You've been a bad girl, Toni.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.005
And I've come to fetch ya.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.448
I have Sam Winchester.
He's close to breaking.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.921
- Just leave me be.
- MICK: No can do.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.651
You disobeyed orders.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.889
Oh, and you should know.
Your Ms. Watt... Quite dead.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.927
<i>Courtesy of Dean Winchester and friends.</i>

10:15.640 --> 10:18.450
ROWENA: <i>Sent me to
the grandest boardin' schools, but...</i>

10:18.800 --> 10:21.485
I was a wee imp
and ran away for a life in the arts.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.604
Mother didn't speak to me,
until I became a star.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.081
A star?

10:29.240 --> 10:30.241
Of?

10:31.640 --> 10:34.689
Uh, do you follow the Royal Ballet?

10:36.720 --> 10:37.801
Not a bit.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.725
The Royal Ballet.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.328
You know, it reminds me a lot of my story.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.889
I left school to work in a steel mill.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.731
I rose up through the ranks
and now I own half a dozen.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.127
You're not serious?

10:56.760 --> 10:58.171
CROWLEY: <i>More wine, Madam?</i>

11:01.080 --> 11:04.721
You're like a boil that keeps comin' back,
no matter how many times I have it lanced.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.961
Let me guess.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.091
Your dinner date is loaded, single
and possibly in delicate health.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.442
- What of it?
- Well, just a stab.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.085
But, you probably don't want me to reveal

11:14.480 --> 11:17.529
that his snookums is
300 years old and a witch.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.602
Fergus, the man treats me like a queen.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.925
It's my chance to leave behind monsters
and demons and moldy hideouts.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.561
So help me, if you muck this up...

11:30.120 --> 11:31.451
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, Mummy.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.000
If you do me one tiny favor...

11:39.120 --> 11:40.610
Help me with Lucifer.

11:41.960 --> 11:42.961
Lucifer?

11:44.040 --> 11:45.451
I have a score to settle.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.921
EMCEE: <i>Let's hear it for Vince Vincente
and the rest of the band.</i>

12:04.240 --> 12:05.401
<i>See you next time around.</i>

12:05.640 --> 12:07.369
<i>Good night, Cleveland!</i>

12:07.880 --> 12:09.325
FEMALE FAN: <i>I love you guys.</i>

12:09.560 --> 12:12.404
<i>Good night, Cleveland. We love you!</i>

12:27.360 --> 12:29.761
Hey, Vinnie, we're hittin'
the town tonight. Come with us.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.525
Check out the wonders of Cleveland.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.164
Yeah, I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.444
- MAN: <i>Tommy. Tommy, come on.</i>
- Yeah.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.003
TOMMY:
<i>Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later.</i>

12:42.000 --> 12:46.528
Dude, you...
You gotta start living your life, man.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.281
You perform, you drink, you sleep,
perform, drink...

12:50.560 --> 12:51.686
I get it.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.281
I get it.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.847
Look, Vince.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.443
<i>It's been years since Jen died.</i>

13:05.560 --> 13:07.642
All I mean, brother, is...

13:08.240 --> 13:10.322
<i>Don't you think she'd want more for you
than just...</i>

13:10.640 --> 13:11.801
Get outta here, Tommy.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.200
Go see Cleveland.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.687
Can't believe I let you talk me into this.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.560
I'm your mother,
you have to do what I say.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.242
Look, they targeted the bunker.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.926
They obviously
know a lot about you and Sam.

14:06.600 --> 14:11.322
They'll be expecting you.
I'm the last person they'd expect.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.847
You were good at this, weren't you?

14:19.160 --> 14:20.161
Very.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.440
The thing is, hunters...

14:25.160 --> 14:29.529
No matter how good they are,
they all end up the same way.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.045
You know, when you died, it changed Dad.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.927
I mean, he was hellbent
on finding out what happened.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.202
The hunter life, it just took him over.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.005
I guess I was the same.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.808
But, Sammy... Sammy... He was different.
He wanted out.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.523
You know, he went to school.
He went to Stanford.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.521
Sam had a chance to get out?
And he came back?

15:03.080 --> 15:04.650
When Dad disappeared...

15:06.480 --> 15:09.324
Sam and I looked around
and something became very clear.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.683
That the only thing we had in the world,
the only thing,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.891
aside from this car, was each other.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.845
JENNIFER: <i>Vince. Vince.</i>

16:41.760 --> 16:44.445
Hello, front desk. Hello?

16:47.200 --> 16:48.406
JENNIFER: <i>Vince.</i>

16:48.640 --> 16:50.768
<i>Vince.</i>

17:06.839 --> 17:08.444
<i>Vince.</i>

17:09.119 --> 17:10.121
<i>Vince.</i>

17:12.200 --> 17:13.201
No.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.486
- Jen?
- Yes, Vince.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.810
How? Why?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.042
I needed to say I'm sorry.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.209
Swallowing those pills was selfish.

17:31.160 --> 17:34.289
I've had to live all these years
knowing how I treated you.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.405
At the time, leaving you seemed fair,
since you left me so many times.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.404
All I want is you.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.483
That can happen, Vince.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.281
- What can happen?
- You and me.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.250
- Together.
- Are you a ghost?

17:57.760 --> 18:01.162
No. I'm an angel.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.650
Those are real?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.801
Real and very powerful, Vince.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.761
I can take away your pain.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.084
Bring you peace.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.370
You only have to do one easy thing.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.321
What?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.489
Will you invite me in?

18:25.840 --> 18:27.888
Yes.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.604
What's the bloody hold-up?

18:40.440 --> 18:43.364
He's the one and only Satan
in the phone book.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.124
It's witchcraft, not Google Maps.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.091
And normally, I'd have a piece of hair
or a belonging to lock onto.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.521
You don't even know what he looks like!

18:51.760 --> 18:54.206
He has an aura. Supreme evil.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.245
Lock onto that.
Do I have to do everything?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.082
I can't believe I'm once again
down in some dank hole

19:01.360 --> 19:03.362
seeking the Devil. When does it end?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.810
It's exactly why
I'm retiring to Boca Raton.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.442
- With Ben.
- "Ben?"

19:10.960 --> 19:12.928
Who makes oatmeal look fascinating.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.645
He's successful, stable
and I'll outlive him.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.689
- CROWLEY: <i>Lucifer?</i>
- I think so.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.884
Yes. I'll give you the location.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.241
No, no, no. Not now.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.444
I just want to know
who we're dealing with before we attack.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.880
By "we," I presume you mean
the Winchesters and their pet angel.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.205
I don't need them. Just you.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.604
Look, it's obvious.
Got to put Lucifer back in the cage.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.731
<i>You're the only one that can do it.</i>

19:53.680 --> 19:55.409
I should've known.

19:57.200 --> 20:01.000
No, Fergus. I'll not be involved
in that nonsense again!

20:01.600 --> 20:04.126
Maybe I should tell Ben about you.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.605
Maybe just kill him.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.009
Either way, it's bye-bye Boca.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.843
You are a hateful snake.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.401
<i>In any case, Lucifer can't be sent back
to the Cage while he's in a vessel.</i>

20:25.240 --> 20:26.241
He won't be.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.970
Not by the time we're ready.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.887
Where's all this warding you mentioned?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.161
It's cloaked. It's very powerful.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.200
You brought your mother?

21:06.560 --> 21:07.686
Hello, Castiel.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.291
Yes, he did.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.610
You sure there's anyone's inside?

21:11.840 --> 21:15.049
No. The agent said the lease
was handled long-distance.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.288
But, someone warded the house.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.086
I'm gonna go have a closer look.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.685
Mom, I got this.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.041
You can keep me from driving, Dean.
Not from hunting.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.647
I'm locked out by the warding.
I could use the company.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.161
Thanks.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.444
Dude, it's noon. Let me in.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.721
Whoa.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.081
Look at you.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.562
Pretty dressed up for a rehearsal,
don't you think?

22:10.360 --> 22:11.600
Rehearsal?

22:12.920 --> 22:13.921
Brother, are you okay?

22:14.280 --> 22:16.328
Yeah, I just can't make it to rehearsal.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.001
Yeah, you got better plans.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.446
I do.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.523
Vince, I'm serious.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.885
- So am I.
- All right.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.925
Look, stop screwing around.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.283
I said I had plans.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.290
Son of a bitch.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.806
Screw yourself.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.847
Dean.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.088
I'm as happy to see him as you are.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.169
'Cause, while you may be able to withstand

24:04.400 --> 24:07.085
my snapping apart your body,
joint by joint,

24:07.680 --> 24:09.569
can you watch it happen to Dean?

24:21.360 --> 24:25.081
They told me you'd be here. Really?

24:28.040 --> 24:30.884
Get off my furniture, squatter.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.800
Lucifer.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.487
Wearing Vince Vincente, second-tier star.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.165
I would have thought
Bieber was more your style.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.331
You're either mad or dim.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.970
CROWLEY: <i>I have a proposal.</i>

24:52.120 --> 24:53.963
<i>I mean, why in hell</i>

24:54.240 --> 24:59.485
would you want to rule over
a motley, witless crew of demons?

24:59.760 --> 25:01.762
God's on sabbatical, again.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.286
You could reclaim Heaven.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.089
<i>Now, that's real estate
that's worth ruling.</i>

25:09.640 --> 25:11.290
I can handle the branch office.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.361
Hmm.

25:14.720 --> 25:15.767
Or...

25:17.440 --> 25:21.445
I could raise my hand,
smite you into oblivion.

25:32.920 --> 25:33.921
Problem?

25:38.480 --> 25:42.041
Mummy's little paralyzing spell.
Trust me, it works.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.965
Trust me. Not for long.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.321
Holy water?

25:52.560 --> 25:53.561
CROWLEY: <i>Yeah.</i>

25:54.160 --> 25:55.321
Ooh. Ouch.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.206
Don't bore me.

25:59.320 --> 26:02.005
No, actually,
it's top-shelf sulfuric acid.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.210
<i>Harmless to you, I know.</i>

26:04.480 --> 26:06.608
But to your vessel? Not so much.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.687
Passcodes, Sam?

26:29.160 --> 26:30.161
Not yet?

26:35.440 --> 26:37.966
- Anything to add?
- No, no.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.044
I just came by for some tea and a beating.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.201
Really?

26:43.840 --> 26:46.764
See, I thought you might be on
for a little chat about your mate.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.121
Benjamin Lafitte.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.682
Oh, sorry. You called him Benny.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.886
<i>You know, the vampire</i>

26:55.120 --> 26:58.203
whom you released from purgatory
and befriended.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.281
<i>I see.</i>

27:02.360 --> 27:06.001
Well, the English are nothing
if not patient.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.241
Now!

27:28.560 --> 27:31.325
His essence... Send it back to the Cage.

27:37.800 --> 27:38.847
Mother?

27:48.280 --> 27:50.248
CROWLEY: <i>It's not working.</i>

28:26.520 --> 28:27.965
Bad bet, Crowley.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.646
Seriously?

28:43.600 --> 28:45.364
You spoil that boy.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.801
Dean?

28:50.880 --> 28:51.881
Hey.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.641
I thought you were dead.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.244
I'm not sure that I'm not.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.601
So?

28:57.920 --> 28:59.490
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything, okay?

28:59.720 --> 29:02.690
First off, who's Angry Spice?

29:03.440 --> 29:07.684
She... She's... She's Men of Letters.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.686
- At the British Men of Letters.
- Is that a thing?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.560
Well, what the hell?
Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?

29:18.480 --> 29:20.209
- Oh, God.
- TONI: Gentlemen-

29:21.360 --> 29:23.408
So, to recap...

29:23.920 --> 29:26.082
You live in the Men of Letters bunker.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.840
Awash in the world's greatest collection
of occult knowledge

29:29.160 --> 29:31.481
and yet, you know nothing.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.211
Right.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.480
What a waste.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.641
It seems you apes
have never read a single book.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.365
The Men of Letters has a long tradition
of intellectual excellence.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.486
In London,
we've undertaken exhaustive studies

29:47.720 --> 29:50.041
of even the most arcane topics.

29:53.320 --> 29:58.121
For example, parts of the body
most sensitive to intense pain.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.201
The eardrum.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.566
Decaying tooth.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.641
Below the belt, of course.
And my favorite.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.730
Under the eyelid.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.085
Did you know it's possible
to die from pain?

30:26.040 --> 30:27.405
Get away from my boys.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.846
- Mom?
- Yeah.

30:39.760 --> 30:40.807
Drop it.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.041
Ground.

30:50.920 --> 30:51.921
That's the ground.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.361
Oh, crap.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.810
Kill the spell now.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.401
I'm not kidding.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.483
Shoot me and your mother has no chance.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.641
The gun.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.921
Dean!

32:04.280 --> 32:05.281
DEAN: <i>It's okay.</i>

32:06.160 --> 32:08.367
She's using
a Chinese mind control technique.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.050
Hard to do when you're unconscious.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.647
Turns out this ape did read a book or two.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.201
MICK: <i>Well-played.</i>

32:29.520 --> 32:31.124
<i>Now, what you were told is basically true.</i>

32:32.040 --> 32:33.849
We were keen on
knowin' about the two of you.

32:34.080 --> 32:37.971
Seeing as you seemed to be partially
carrying on the Men of Letters' work here.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.402
<i>Now that the American chapter is defunct.</i>

32:40.680 --> 32:43.365
So you sic your attack dog on us
to what, say hi?

32:45.200 --> 32:48.409
Well, parts of our group suspect
some kind of malfeasance

32:48.640 --> 32:50.529
amongst you American hunters.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.682
No argument, Lady Bevell went too far.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.286
<i>I deeply apologize.</i>

32:55.480 --> 32:56.481
Hmm.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.486
She'll face consequences in London.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.451
I'll tell you what,
why don't you take a walk

33:02.720 --> 33:04.643
and she can face those
consequences right here and now?

33:10.400 --> 33:11.401
She's ours.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.480
<i>We'll take care of her.</i>

33:13.760 --> 33:16.366
Now, I'm here to extend an olive branch.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.130
- We want to work with you...
- Let me ask you a question.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.606
Mick, is it?

33:21.560 --> 33:23.403
Why would we believe any of this?

33:24.920 --> 33:28.447
Lads, if I wasn't sincere,

33:29.480 --> 33:32.484
<i>if I meant you harm, there's a dozen ways
I could've come in here</i>

33:32.800 --> 33:35.770
and taken you all prisoner,
instead of being unarmed.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.924
Not to mention, I powered down
all the wardings in this shack

33:42.160 --> 33:43.571
so your attack dog could come in.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.526
I reckon he could finish me off
without breakin' a sweat, am I right?

33:49.640 --> 33:52.211
I don't sweat under any circumstances.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.169
My number.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.569
Take your time. Cool down.
And just think it over.

34:04.120 --> 34:07.806
And what have you got to lose,
except your worst nightmares?

34:19.159 --> 34:22.369
Oh, that was fantastic. Thank you, Mom.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.485
All I did was point to some stuff
on a take-out menu.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.129
I would've cooked, but I don't.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.324
Well, then, wait.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.051
Your meatloaf was amazing.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.085
Came from the Piggly Wiggly.
Sorry to burst your bubble.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.330
But, do you still like pie?

34:43.679 --> 34:45.205
I mean...

34:50.800 --> 34:55.168
Sam, you keep looking at me
like I'm going to explode.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.247
I'm sorry.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.161
But, what do we think? Are we buying that
Brit's whole "let's be friends" routine?

35:05.560 --> 35:07.528
- No. No way.
- No.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.484
Could you eat that any faster?

35:17.760 --> 35:19.728
No. No, I could not.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.922
Well, we should call the Internet

35:27.200 --> 35:29.043
and find out as much as we can
about these people.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.246
Did I say that right?

35:35.080 --> 35:37.526
- So close.
- Yeah, it was close.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.049
- You want any?
- SAM: No, not now.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.168
You know, I gotta say, Rowena,

35:56.920 --> 35:58.604
I took one look at you,

35:59.400 --> 36:04.088
and all I wanted was to
snap your miserable neck again.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.403
<i>And keep it snapped this time.</i>

36:11.280 --> 36:13.408
But I think I've decided against it.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.368
You won't regret it, sir.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.762
I am done with all this.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.525
I'll stay far, far away,

36:21.800 --> 36:24.406
sipping martinis with Republicans
at my tennis club.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.847
You're missing my point.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.410
<i>A witch as gifted as yourself,</i>

36:32.120 --> 36:34.771
with access to
<i>The Book of the Damned,</i> to boot,

36:35.960 --> 36:39.646
would be much more valuable
as a prisoner.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.121
What?

36:42.440 --> 36:43.965
How's that saying go?

36:45.440 --> 36:47.761
Mmm. "Friends close..."

36:51.840 --> 36:53.683
"Enemies closer."

36:54.200 --> 36:56.328
No. No...

36:59.080 --> 37:00.127
Yes?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.325
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.281
Sorry. I hope I didn't wake you up.
I, uh...

37:09.640 --> 37:11.369
I wanted to bring you this.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.567
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.444
I don't know if you drink tea, but...

37:17.320 --> 37:18.765
- I do.
- Good.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.410
And I wanted to say, um...

37:25.240 --> 37:26.480
If you ever want to talk,

37:27.160 --> 37:33.486
I know what it's like to come back
and not feel like you really fit.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.362
I just have so much
about you boys to catch up on.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.564
Mother stuff, you know.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.920
First tooth.

37:45.640 --> 37:46.641
First crush.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.406
Yeah.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.124
I just have a lot of blanks to fill in.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.006
Right. Uh...

37:59.960 --> 38:01.121
Dad's journal.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.049
<i>His writing. His words.
Helped me fill in some blanks.</i>

38:05.360 --> 38:07.761
Answer some questions
I didn't know I had.

38:09.040 --> 38:13.921
And, you know, it keeps him with us.
Sort of.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.041
Thank you.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.481
Good night.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.328
Dean said you got out of hunting.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.721
Yeah.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.891
And yet, here you are.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.609
Well, this is my family.

38:37.720 --> 38:40.087
And my family hunts, you know.
It's what we do.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.567
Mom?

38:53.480 --> 38:54.641
For me,

38:56.120 --> 38:57.201
just, um,

38:58.800 --> 39:00.245
having you here

39:04.480 --> 39:06.084
fills in the biggest blank.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.845
I will not get on that plane.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.326
Yes, you will.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.728
Your mission was
to identify American hunters

40:27.960 --> 40:29.371
and gain their trust.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.171
That's what the home office wants.

40:31.440 --> 40:32.441
Honey, not vinegar.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.206
I have a dossier
and I am just getting started.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.368
They've also had
their fair share of successes.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.484
If our goal is to
end the supernatural threat here,

40:42.720 --> 40:44.802
we need to destroy every obstacle.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.969
The Winchesters, these American hunters,

40:47.200 --> 40:49.806
they're no better than
the monsters they fail to control.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.210
<i>They need to be eliminated.</i>

40:54.960 --> 40:55.961
Mick?

40:58.120 --> 41:00.566
If push comes to shove, your ladyship,

41:01.280 --> 41:02.281
I'm prepared for that.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.845
You'll get your hands dirty?

41:06.840 --> 41:08.365
Well, we have Mr. Ketch for that.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.721
You'll send for him?

41:12.560 --> 41:13.607
I already have.
