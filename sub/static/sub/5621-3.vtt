<i>You're watching</i>
The Grinder.

00:02.370 --> 00:05.104
-For justice?
-For justice!

This is Edie,
your granddaughter.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:21.387
GRINDER: There's still one thing
that doesn't make sense to me.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.188
The senator's suicide.
But the coroner said...

00:23.190 --> 00:26.158
I know damn well
what the coroner said.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.027
I broke into the morgue
last night.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.429
I re-performed
the autopsy myself.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.136
And I found this.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.740
You want to bet
that this matches the gun

00:41.742 --> 00:43.575
the FBI found
in your apartment?

00:45.579 --> 00:48.480
It's over.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.916
Admit it.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.918
What gave me away?

00:54.889 --> 00:58.757
You... just... did.

00:58.759 --> 01:02.061
That's right. I had
nothing on you, Ivy Dexter,

01:02.063 --> 01:04.596
but a hunch.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.232
And this bullet

01:07.234 --> 01:09.802
that almost took
my life in Macau.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.073
She's all yours, guys.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.508
What?!

01:16.510 --> 01:18.377
Damn you, Grinder!

01:18.379 --> 01:20.012
Damn you!

01:20.014 --> 01:22.714
So, are we gonna
have<i> The Grinder</i>

01:22.716 --> 01:24.416
just on all
the time now?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.918
In 170 countries.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.286
And in none of those countries

01:27.288 --> 01:28.787
do they have a problem
with characters

01:28.789 --> 01:30.355
that just confess for no reason?

01:30.357 --> 01:32.591
I don't think
you understood the plot.
Oh.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.526
Yeah, I probably
didn't get it.
Yeah.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.961
So, The Grinder had
a real dilemma in this one,

01:35.963 --> 01:37.629
'cause he had to lie.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.565
Those scenes really
took it out on me.
Oh, did they?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.900
They took a lot out of you? How
much did they take out of you?

01:41.902 --> 01:44.303
A lot.
A lot?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.737
These scenes took
a lot out of you?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.739
Can't walk in my shoes.
Oh, Dean.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.642
I could see you
struggling with it.
Yeah.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.779
Because he values justice,
but he also values honesty.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.948
And he only lied
to expose the truth.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.216
Which is a good lie.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.550
Exactly.
No!

01:58.552 --> 01:59.585
Not exactly.

01:59.587 --> 02:00.986
It was not a good lie, Ethan.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.321
There's no such
thing as good lies.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.956
Can we please
not use episodes

02:03.958 --> 02:05.791
of<i> The Grinder</i> to teach
life lessons to my kids?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.493
I'm sorry. Would you rather
him learn it on the streets?

02:07.495 --> 02:09.761
I think there are more than
those two options for him,

02:09.763 --> 02:11.797
but if you're
making me choose now,

02:11.799 --> 02:13.599
I would say,
uh, the streets.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.000
I would say the streets.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.568
Streets by a mile.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.476
Stew, hope you don't mind.
I borrowed your robe.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.245
Oh. No. It's all right, Dad.

02:26.247 --> 02:29.081
Just wish you hadn't taken it
while I was still in the shower.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.950
Oh, did you need it?
Yeah. That's...
why I hung it there.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.318
Well, just say
that, Stew.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.020
Okay, yeah,
next time, I'll...

02:35.022 --> 02:36.588
I'll just say it.
Anyway,

02:36.590 --> 02:38.290
thanks for letting me crash
while they paint my house.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.026
You're always
welcome, Dad.

02:41.028 --> 02:44.129
But there is something
we need to talk about.
Yeah, whatever you want.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.198
Thank you.
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, appreciate that.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.766
Last night,

02:47.768 --> 02:50.836
we tried to watch...
<i>Ray Donovan.</i>

02:52.806 --> 02:54.940
Okay.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.776
But we couldn't because
someone deleted it off the DVR.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.878
It wasn't me.
Wasn't me, either.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.515
I hate to be that guy, but maybe
we look to Uncle Dean for this.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.350
DEAN:
Nice try, big fella.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.819
But after what the DVR did to
the traditional ratings model,

03:07.821 --> 03:09.388
I don't touch the damn things.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.323
You heard 'em, Ethan.
Time to fess up, bud.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.192
Do not let her
play you like this.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.693
We're not even upset
about<i> Ray Donovan.</i>

03:14.695 --> 03:16.295
We're a little upset
about<i> Ray Donovan.</i>

03:16.297 --> 03:17.729
We're a little upset about it,

03:17.731 --> 03:19.698
but what we're really
upset about is the fact

03:19.700 --> 03:21.900
that you guys are lying
to us right now.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.702
Two siblings locked
in the stalemate of a lifetime,

03:23.704 --> 03:25.137
neither one giving an inch.

03:25.139 --> 03:26.705
Thank you, Dean.
Yes.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.040
Always appreciate
your narration.
Mm-hmm.

03:28.042 --> 03:28.974
Oh, I'm happy to do it.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.509
You know what it reminds me of?

03:30.511 --> 03:31.910
When your dad broke
his bedroom window

03:31.912 --> 03:34.246
and tried to
blame it on me.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.048
Dad, you did that?
No!

03:36.050 --> 03:37.549
That is not at all
what happened.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.084
That's how I remember it.
No.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.153
Your grandfather
just believes your uncle

03:41.155 --> 03:43.055
because he's a better actor.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.190
I always thought you
were a tremendous actor.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.526
You just never gave
yourself enough credit.
Great. Thank you, Dean.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.595
Your father's just bitter
because he got caught.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.163
And then I had to ground him,

03:51.165 --> 03:52.998
and then he missed his prom
or whatever.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.600
It was not my
prom or whatever.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.535
It was the sophomore
overnight field trip.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.870
And you know...
You know what?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.739
Doesn't matter.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.176
Let's just forget about it.
It was a long time ago, so...

04:04.178 --> 04:06.211
But I will tell you this.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.779
If I did break the window,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.548
and I'd been lying about it
this whole time,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.617
I certainly would be big enough
to admit it now.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.919
And how do we know that
<i> that</i> isn't a lie?
All right, kids,

04:13.921 --> 04:17.556
we are not letting you follow
in the footsteps of your uncle,

04:17.558 --> 04:19.291
so, until one of you comes
clean, you're both grounded.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.959
What? Oh, come on.
That's not's fair.
She did it.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.728
Tell him you did it.
Are you kidding me, Ethan?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.129
Two siblings pitted
against each other

04:24.131 --> 04:26.198
in a battle of
consciences.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.033
Who will prevail?
Please stop.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.602
A father... at the
end of his rope.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.204
You broke the window.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.041
Okay, uh, last piece
of business.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.243
There's been a little setback
on the personal injury case.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.778
Rozz/Landy's introduced some new
evidence that we need to go...

04:39.780 --> 04:42.080
Sorry. Which case is this?
It's the one where

04:42.082 --> 04:44.383
the mom tripped on the broken
step in front of the school.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.751
Rozz/Landy's
trying to get out of

04:45.753 --> 04:47.286
paying our client's
medical bills.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.955
They found out she has a
preexisting ankle injury.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.090
How? The client told us that
in confidence.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.593
We don't know, Todd. Sometimes
these things just happen.

04:54.595 --> 04:58.063
Or...<i> do</i> we know?

04:58.065 --> 05:00.966
And these things
<i> don't</i> just happen?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.401
What are you thinking, Deano?

05:02.403 --> 05:04.770
Season six, Episode 13,
"Fire in the Mole."

05:04.772 --> 05:06.171
"Fire in the Mole."

05:06.173 --> 05:07.572
Ivy Dexter was leaking secrets

05:07.574 --> 05:09.274
to the Santino crime family.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.776
Everyone trusted her.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.078
No one saw it coming...
except me.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.314
Except your character.
Hmm?

05:15.316 --> 05:16.748
Nobody saw it coming
except your character.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.150
You didn't do anything.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.584
You just said the words
they wrote down for you.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.420
DEAN SR.:
No need to nitpick, Stew.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.021
We all knew what he meant.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.523
This is a family law firm.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.658
Rozz/Landy did not plant a mole

05:26.660 --> 05:28.827
to get an edge
on a $900 injury case.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.097
Okay, nobody in this room is
working for the other side.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.966
Mm-hmm.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.669
I'm sorry. Dean, are you
suggesting that it's me?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.371
I'm a mole?

05:39.373 --> 05:42.174
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No one's suggesting anything.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.042
But that said, wow!

05:44.044 --> 05:45.444
A little defensive.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.979
Okay, well, I'm gonna go,

05:47.981 --> 05:49.881
maybe circle back
and look for some witnesses.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.184
STEWART: Thank you, Claire, for
presenting an actual solution.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.286
All right, I'm gonna
run over to the court.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.987
Everyone else have stuff to do?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.356
Tons of stuff.
Very valuable here.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.423
We'll hold down the fort.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.166
Obviously it's Claire, right?

06:08.168 --> 06:09.301
So what are we thinking?
Fire her?

06:09.303 --> 06:11.236
Start beefing up my role here?

06:11.238 --> 06:13.004
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, Todd.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.207
You got to remember,

06:15.209 --> 06:17.576
one step...

06:17.578 --> 06:19.811
at a time.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.581
One step at a time. Yes.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.729
(whispers):
Stew?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.598
Stew?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.000
Oh, my God.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.735
Are you sleeping?
Yes, I'm sleeping.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.771
What do you want?
Dean?

06:45.773 --> 06:49.408
Hi, Deb. I need to
talk to you. Hallway.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.877
Are you insane?
Are you a crazy person?
It's the middle of the night.

06:51.879 --> 06:52.944
Two seconds.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.646
I'm... Oh, my God.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.417
Thanks for coming
out in the hall.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.618
Do you not sleep?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.353
This is gonna be
very hard for you to hear,

07:01.355 --> 07:03.522
because I know how much you hate
admitting that you're wrong.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.056
The broken window thing.
You broke the window.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.558
I didn't.
You, Dean,
broke the window.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.927
I didn't bring you out in
the hallway to argue with you.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.096
I have something very important
I want to tell you.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.365
Dean, Claire is not a mole.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.367
Okay, hear me out.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.803
She's a new hire,
she worked for the other side,

07:17.805 --> 07:19.438
she refuses to sleep with me.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.907
Good night, Dean.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.875
It adds up!

07:26.079 --> 07:28.980
It adds<i> way</i> up.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.583
TODD:<i> That bitch</i>
<i> isn't fooling anyone.</i>

07:31.585 --> 07:33.385
Dean and I are onto her.

07:33.387 --> 07:34.586
She's a mole, Murph.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.921
Okay.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.722
Let's see, what
else happened

07:37.724 --> 07:41.460
at work that I can
tell you about?

07:41.462 --> 07:43.628
Oh, another free one.

07:43.630 --> 07:47.599
Thanks, dawg.
You always hook me up.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.901
You know,
you come by here a lot

07:49.903 --> 07:51.903
and you seem to be
a pretty decent guy.

07:51.905 --> 07:52.904
I appreciate that.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.105
I got to tell you
something.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.908
It hasn't been me
buying you these drinks.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.677
It's been them.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.145
Oh!

08:00.147 --> 08:02.414
Hey, Rozz/Landy!

08:04.351 --> 08:06.451
MURPH:
Those lawyers send over shots

08:06.453 --> 08:08.019
to get you drunk,
and then they write down

08:08.021 --> 08:09.354
what you say
about your cases.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.923
What?

08:11.925 --> 08:14.092
MURPH:
Like the other day,

08:14.094 --> 08:15.927
when you were talking about
those medical records.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.864
Then, a couple of weeks ago, you
were talking about that client

08:18.866 --> 08:21.867
that got hit by a car and how
that case went against you.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.869
(echoing):
And, oh, my goodness,

08:23.871 --> 08:26.137
the time you were talking about
that divorce settlement.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.540
I mean, they just kept
feeding you drinks all night.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.782
Dean, I-I need to tell you
something, and it's important.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.619
Well, Todd... you can always
tell me anything.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.454
Because we're friends?
I wouldn't get
hung up on why.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.456
Claire's clean.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.957
She's not the mole.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.826
What? H-How do you know?
Because it was me!

08:47.828 --> 08:50.862
I was yappin' my big,
dumb mouth at the bar,

08:50.864 --> 08:53.331
and Rozz and Landy
heard everything.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.200
I am the leak.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.202
I am so embarrassed.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.004
Do you know what this means?

08:59.006 --> 09:01.640
Yes, that you hate me and
you hate everything about me.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.375
Ugh. No, it's worse.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.076
I was wrong.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.378
We both were wrong.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.880
All right, you need to
promise me something.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.814
Anything.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.485
Stewart can never know.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.522
So I think it's time
we have a frank,

09:17.524 --> 09:18.857
adult conversation.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.559
I just need 20
Can you give me 20?

09:20.561 --> 09:22.227
Turn off the TV.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.428
Isn't that the show

09:23.430 --> 09:25.597
that you two just
got grounded for erasing?

09:25.599 --> 09:26.865
Yeah, it's on demand.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.166
I don't know
what they're so pissed about.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.501
Well, they're pissed
about the lying.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.503
Ethan did it.
Oh, my goodness,
Lizzie did it.

09:31.505 --> 09:32.938
Ethan, you're being
ridiculous right now. It's...

09:32.940 --> 09:34.205
No, I'm not being rid...

09:34.207 --> 09:37.342
You guys are more stubborn
than your dad ever was.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.578
Well, maybe it's because
he's telling the truth

09:39.580 --> 09:41.246
and he didn't
break that window?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.882
Well, Dean didn't break it,
so who the hell did?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.917
I was so wrong
that it made you wrong, too.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.919
Well, it's fine
for you to be wrong.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.054
Everybody expects
you to be wrong.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.055
Sure.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.756
It is not a good look on me.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.959
It's why The Grinder
was never wrong on the show.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.794
Because I could never
believably play it.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.063
It's my one flaw as an actor.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.031
Great news. There's been
a breakthrough in the case.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.132
CLAIRE:
A security camera

10:01.134 --> 10:02.200
caught the fall,

10:02.202 --> 10:03.635
and I got an X-ray
of her ankle

10:03.637 --> 10:05.236
that supports our timeline.
Open and shut.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.607
Wow! That is great
work, Claire.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.442
You've done
something for us

10:10.444 --> 10:13.812
that directly affects Rozz/Landy
in a negative way.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.947
Yes, that was the idea.
Hmm.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.649
CLAIRE: Well, we
should head over there

10:17.651 --> 10:19.451
and put an end
to the whole thing.
Yes.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.986
Todd, could you
give us a second?

10:20.988 --> 10:23.221
It was good talking to you.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.894
Anything you'd like to...

10:29.896 --> 10:31.663
Like to what?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.999
Dean.
Come on, you can admit it.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.900
You were wrong about Claire.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.502
Or...
There is no "or."

10:37.504 --> 10:39.137
She's playing a deeper game
than we thought.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.406
She absolutely is not.
Dean, you don't have to

10:41.408 --> 10:44.275
double down on this.
Just admit it. You were...

10:44.277 --> 10:46.277
Not thorough enough.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.613
I was not thorough enough.
Thank you.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.682
That was a great note.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.351
And...

10:55.322 --> 10:56.821
...freeze.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.323
The step

10:58.325 --> 11:01.359
was... broken.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.961
Stuberto.
(exhales)

11:02.963 --> 11:06.531
Coming in with a last-minute
case closer, Grinder-style.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.333
(chuckles)
Look at you, bud.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.834
Proud of you, big dog.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.337
Thank you, Pat.
That means so much.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.772
We'll come by
with the settlement tomorrow.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.873
Make sure
that settlement includes

11:14.875 --> 11:16.508
all medical expenses, plus fees.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.610
Ooh, what a team.
He's got the video,

11:18.612 --> 11:20.779
she comes in with
the legalese.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.047
It's really working, huh?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.315
Yeah. Sorry we had to steal
her away from you guys.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.718
Well, they didn't exactly
steal me. I wanted out.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.553
Desperately.
You two are terrible.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.488
I hear you.
And we're working on that.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.624
But we were a little chapped
when you left,

11:32.626 --> 11:35.226
so that's why we took
advantage of your boy.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.629
Uh... what do you
mean? Who's my boy?

11:37.631 --> 11:39.330
Todd. At the bar.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.299
Not proud of it.
No.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.134
Thinking back,
not our finest moment,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.503
because, dude,
we respect you. We do.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.905
We just don't show it.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.940
No hard feelings,
right?

11:50.911 --> 11:53.778
STEWART:
Rozz and Landy say hi.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.051
Oh, uh, cool, cool. Uh...

12:00.053 --> 12:02.253
Tell 'em I said what's up.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.321
Todd.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.328
I'm sorry, okay?
I wanted to let you know,

12:10.330 --> 12:12.330
I swear, but Dean
wouldn't let me.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.666
Dean knew?

12:14.668 --> 12:16.334
No...

12:16.336 --> 12:19.070
Dean... knew it was you,
but he couldn't admit it.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.239
Don't be mad at Dean. This is
all my fault. Don't be mad...

12:21.241 --> 12:22.707
Listen to me, listen to me.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.743
You have to promise me
something.
Anything.

12:24.745 --> 12:29.881
You can't let Dean know
that I know he knows.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.884
I will not let-let Dean
know that you know that...

12:32.886 --> 12:36.354
Don't let Dean know
that I know he knows.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.622
Got it. I'm not
involved in that.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.390
Dean, you... Dean.
Right.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.792
Okay.
Say it back to me.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.761
Don't let Dean knows that
you know that I know...

12:42.763 --> 12:45.130
No, no.
Dean knows he doesn't know.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.466
You can't let Dean know...
that I know he knows.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.934
I promise. I prom...

12:49.936 --> 12:51.369
Are you sure?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.471
'Cause you just let me know
that Dean knows.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.939
Oh, I see what
you're saying. Oh.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.575
Right? So you have to do
the opposite

12:57.577 --> 12:59.611
and not let Dean know
that I know he knows.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.812
Got it.
You got it?

13:00.814 --> 13:02.547
Got it.
All right, good, good.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.083
I'm not gonna repeat it
back to you, but I got it.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.619
I think I would feel better
if you just said it once

13:07.621 --> 13:09.754
back to me that it was clear.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.656
Okay, I'm gonna be you
and repeat it back to you.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.058
No, don't just repeat my words,
say it in your own words,

13:14.060 --> 13:15.460
so I know
that you got the message.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.462
But if I do it as
me, then all the...

13:17.464 --> 13:19.597
But you say it in your own...
...pronouns, the
pronouns change.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.767
Again, to review,
you need to know

13:22.769 --> 13:25.336
not to let Dean know
that I know.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.604
You see?

13:26.606 --> 13:28.239
Okay.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.074
Wait, why?

13:30.076 --> 13:34.646
Because I'm gonna make
The Grinder admit he was wrong.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.953
Thanks so much
for your hospitality.
Oh, Dad, stay any time.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.255
They love having us.
Oh, we really do.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.192
Guys, if I could have
your attention.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.793
I have to get something
off my chest,

13:48.795 --> 13:52.630
and it's been
really tearing me up.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.699
I think I may have deleted
<i> Ray Donovan.</i>

13:54.701 --> 13:56.367
Oh, Ethan, you did?

13:56.369 --> 13:57.869
ETHAN:
I don't specifically

13:57.871 --> 13:59.304
remember doing it, but...

13:59.306 --> 14:01.306
I think I may have done it
by accident.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.209
And if there's one thing I know,
Lizzie wouldn't do this to me,

14:04.211 --> 14:05.877
lie like this

14:05.879 --> 14:08.012
and let me go down
for something I didn't do.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.716
Because she's my sister.

14:11.718 --> 14:12.951
Wait.

14:12.953 --> 14:13.952
What's going on?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.220
I did it, okay?

14:15.222 --> 14:16.888
I deleted<i> Ray Donovan </i>
by mistake.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.190
Got her!
What? You were faking?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.825
I was acting.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.160
There's a difference.
Right, Uncle Dean?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.962
There sure is.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.964
Okay, well, you're both
still in trouble for lying.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.799
So just, you know,
take it back upstairs

14:27.801 --> 14:29.400
and we'll talk
about this later.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.735
(scoffs)
I don't believe this.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.204
Ethan, you better
watch your back.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.472
Wait, what-what
just happened?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.040
That was quite a
piece of acting.
Yeah.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.543
Thanks. When I was deep in it,

14:38.545 --> 14:40.745
I actually believed
I was guilty.

14:40.747 --> 14:41.980
Yeah, I saw flashes of that.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.681
But I also saw
some false moments.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.916
Okay, I'll work on that.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.484
Well, you'll have
a lot of time in your room.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.685
Let's go. Come on.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.254
STEWART:
<i> I'm very alarmed</i>

14:49.256 --> 14:51.689
that Ethan can make himself cry
so believably.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.024
Oh, I know. That's new.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.893
But it worked.
Got Lizzie to confess.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.895
God, I wish I would've thought
of that back in high school.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.396
You know, missing
that sophomore field trip

14:58.398 --> 15:00.365
extended my virginity
another 18 months.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.933
Oh, yeah? You've done that math
a couple times?

15:01.935 --> 15:02.767
Uh-huh.

15:04.571 --> 15:09.274
So Ethan actually guilted
Lizzie into confessing.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.875
Oh, no.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.278
I see where this is going,
and I think you should stop.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.613
I can break him. I got it.
You think so?

15:15.615 --> 15:16.948
Yeah. Look at Ethan.
Ethan got results.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.049
Okay. Yeah.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.284
I can't cry like him, but...

15:19.286 --> 15:20.618
I can break him Deb.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.886
I got it!

15:21.888 --> 15:23.087
Good luck.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.295
(sighs)

15:32.933 --> 15:34.933
What are you doing in here?

15:34.935 --> 15:37.802
Oh, hi.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.939
I'm just really distraught.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.307
And sad.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.075
What's going on?

15:44.077 --> 15:46.577
I fired Claire tonight.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.479
Really?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.048
Yeah.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.649
She did not take it well.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.652
Probably the...

15:54.654 --> 15:57.722
hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.823
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.125
Um, you did the right thing.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.794
I had to do it.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.229
You were so sure about her.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.998
(sighs)

16:07.000 --> 16:09.167
You couldn't be wrong.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.403
Right.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.706
Yeah.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.342
Yeah.

16:22.615 --> 16:26.317
Probably also gonna...
have to report her to the bar.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.853
Oh. Have to.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.456
That means she won't be able
to practice law anymore.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.925
Her career will be... ruined.

16:33.927 --> 16:36.027
A fitting end.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.497
Just want to make sure
you're okay with that.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.265
(inhales deeply)

16:43.203 --> 16:44.602
Yeah.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.906
I'm gonna go and sleep.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.176
Like a baby.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.611
Oh, come on!

16:53.613 --> 16:55.146
You talked to Todd.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.949
Well, what exactly
are you asking me, Stewart?

16:57.951 --> 17:01.652
Are you asking if Todd told me
that you know that I know?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.354
I knew that guy couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.289
Aw, brother,

17:05.291 --> 17:08.292
Todd didn't tell me anything.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.963
You... just... did.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.670
Hey.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.872
Could I ask you something?

17:20.874 --> 17:22.840
Yeah. Sure.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.075
Sorry, I was sleeping.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.010
Why did you confess earlier?

17:26.012 --> 17:29.013
I don't know. I felt bad
Ethan was getting punished.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.748
Yeah, but they didn't have
anything on you.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.918
I mean, y-you could've
taken that to your grave.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.186
You could've just

17:35.188 --> 17:38.723
lied to yourself
until you believed it.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.493
I hear that... works for people.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.829
But then I would've
been totally trapped.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.330
Like you with
the window.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.598
Like your dad with the window.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.534
Remember, he's the liar there.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.601
Right. Sorry.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.008
ROZZ:
So our client will pay

17:57.010 --> 17:59.343
medical bills
and attorney fees.

17:59.345 --> 18:02.413
And in return, you agree
that no one is at fault.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.382
CLAIRE:
We can agree to that.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.483
Uh, sorry, hold on.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.586
Someone<i> was</i> at fault.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.023
And when someone
is at fault...

18:12.025 --> 18:13.891
they should be
held responsible.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.359
Stewart, that's not
what we discussed.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.763
This world is filled with people
like your client,

18:18.765 --> 18:20.598
who think they don't have
to take responsibility

18:20.600 --> 18:21.599
for what they do.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.034
When someone's wrong,

18:23.036 --> 18:25.770
they should admit
that they're wrong.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.538
I'm a tad confused.
Yeah.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.007
Shouldn't Grinder do
the big speeches?

18:32.946 --> 18:34.512
Don't mind if I do.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.081
I have an announcement to make,

18:37.083 --> 18:38.382
and it's gonna shock
a lot of people.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.554
Stewart isn't talking
about the case.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.125
He's talking about me.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.426
And the fact
that I've been

18:48.428 --> 18:51.696
living a lie
for most of my life.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.267
The truth is, I...

18:56.269 --> 18:58.302
broke the window.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.338
Oh, my God. He admitted it.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.173
After all these years.

19:02.175 --> 19:05.443
I'm sorry I lied.
I'm sorry that you had to miss

19:05.445 --> 19:07.612
that field trip.
You definitely didn't deserve

19:07.614 --> 19:09.480
to have your virginity
dragged out like that.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.482
Ah, we don't have to talk
about... I'm fine now.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.485
But mostly, I'm sorry...
that it took so long

19:14.487 --> 19:16.154
for me to say I'm sorry.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.990
It's okay, Dean.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.526
Nice to hear you say it now.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.697
(chuckles softly)

19:33.139 --> 19:35.006
Okay.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.875
I'm sorry, too, Stew.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.277
I should've believed you.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.112
(chuckles)

19:41.114 --> 19:43.514
Feels kind of weird
being here for this.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.683
Yeah. We're done here, right?
Uh, yes.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.618
We are, uh... we're done.
No, we're not.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.822
There's one more confession
you need to hear.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.792
It's also gonna shock
a lot of people probably.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.832
I... was the mole.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.301
Todd, literally every person
in this room knows that.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.535
Yeah, you told me
to my face.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.003
I think I got it in an e-mail.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.672
We made you the mole.
You were our mole.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.408
You knew?
I did. I did know, Todd.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.310
Okay, never mind.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.514
Next time, I'll
think of something.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.817
I'm sorry that I just
wasted everybody's time.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.889
Tired of fixing things
for people who don't deserve it.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.490
All right.
Wait. Hold on.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.492
So-so Ray was telling the
truth the whole time?

20:28.494 --> 20:29.493
(groans)
I'm sorry.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.095
I'm completely lost.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.064
Lizzie, this is what happens
when you miss an episode.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.565
Okay, I already said
I was sorry.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.866
I'm not gonna feel bad
about it anymore.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.602
I know exactly how you feel.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.170
Yes, you do, son,
and I'm proud of you.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.705
Yes, Dean, we're all
very proud of you

20:40.707 --> 20:42.440
for admitting something
you did 20 years ago.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.942
You're really not mad
at Dean for lying to you?

20:44.944 --> 20:47.111
Eh, he did what he had to do
to get out of trouble.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.113
Can't fault him for that.
I would argue
that you can fault him.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.348
Yeah, you can fault
him for that. Yeah.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.782
He's your son.
He lied to you for 20 years.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.217
You faulted me for the same
thing for, like... Yeah.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.885
Water under the bridge, Stew.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.454
You can't say
it's water under the bridge.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.222
I say it's water under the
bridge. I'm the wronged party.

20:58.224 --> 21:01.192
"Water under the bridge."
Glad you're okay with it.

21:01.194 --> 21:03.027
I haven't felt this good
in years.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.595
This whole
clean conscience thing,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.464
I-I could...
I could get used to it.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.232
Well, Dean, I mean,

21:08.234 --> 21:10.434
your conscience is
still-still a little dirty.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.303
What do you mean?
Well, your uncle was wrong

21:12.305 --> 21:14.105
about the whole
Claire-mole nonsense.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.306
We were both wrong.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.541
What was Dad
wrong about?

21:17.543 --> 21:19.076
Your dad said
that there was no mole

21:19.078 --> 21:20.244
when, in fact, there was one.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.312
Oh, right. Okay.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.313
There was no mole.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.548
Wasn't Todd the mole?

21:24.550 --> 21:27.151
(scoffs) I mean,
yes, I guess...

21:27.153 --> 21:29.820
Yeah, Todd was...
a-a kind of a mole.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.623
And that makes you...

21:32.625 --> 21:34.125
I was wrong.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.260
And I was wrong about
the mole's name.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.062
So... I guess
it's kind of a tie.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.298
Is that what you need to tell
yourself to move on from this?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.234
Yes. Yes, it is.

21:43.236 --> 21:45.169
Would you
un-pause that?

21:45.171 --> 21:47.772
Sure.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.407
RAY DONOVAN:
It's got to change.

21:49.409 --> 21:52.009
Who's that?
ALL: Ray Donovan!
