WEBVTT

00:01.717 --> 00:04.911
We've been planning this
for weeks, Maz. Fine.

00:08.811 --> 00:10.655
Boyfriend trouble?

00:10.680 --> 00:13.018
I mean, can someone
really be your boyfriend

00:13.043 --> 00:14.922
if you barely see them anymore?

00:14.947 --> 00:17.002
[Uh, you put me on the speaker.]

00:20.414 --> 00:21.695
What's the problem?

00:21.720 --> 00:24.078
We've been trying to find a
place over the last month.

00:24.103 --> 00:25.928
Then we line up some Realtors,

00:25.953 --> 00:27.484
set up some viewings and he cancels.

00:27.509 --> 00:28.977
He just can't get away from work.

00:29.002 --> 00:31.439
I mean, who takes their
job that seriously?

00:32.835 --> 00:36.156
- Except me, of course.
- Still no calls?

00:36.181 --> 00:38.749
Mrs. Kowalski and her cheating husband?

00:38.774 --> 00:40.786
Uh! Anyone else?

00:41.441 --> 00:43.912
Do collection agencies count?

00:45.015 --> 00:46.590
You spend a little time in jail

00:46.615 --> 00:49.008
and everyone forgets your number.
Am I right?

00:49.953 --> 00:52.265
- Too soon. My bad.
- No. It's fine.

00:52.290 --> 00:54.407
It's not like that thought
hasn't crossed my mind.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.157
Hey, any calls?

00:58.847 --> 01:00.573
Never mind.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.174
How about...

01:03.199 --> 01:05.789
a couple of courtside seats
to the Hazards playoff game

01:05.814 --> 01:08.058
tonight to lighten the mood?

01:10.211 --> 01:12.007
I know who'll appreciate these.

01:12.032 --> 01:14.543
- Maz.
- Oh no, you don't!

01:14.568 --> 01:17.305
I have a colourcoded schedule
of viewings lined up

01:17.330 --> 01:19.815
over the next couple of days and
I have to keep him focused.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.079
OK.

01:22.686 --> 01:24.923
Everett, get your coat. I'm
getting you out of here.

01:24.948 --> 01:27.133
Uh! Me? No, I'm good. Thanks.

01:27.158 --> 01:29.084
You're about to eat a
tub of sour cream.

01:29.162 --> 01:31.129
- It's kind of like yogurt.
- No, it's not.

01:31.154 --> 01:33.288
Fine. Let's get our home run on!

01:34.661 --> 01:36.525
I'm kidding!

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

01:56.390 --> 01:59.776
There he is! There he is!
MVP, three years in a row.

02:07.553 --> 02:10.420
- <i>Dirty play!</i>
- Come on!

02:10.446 --> 02:12.325
Wake up, ref! You're
missing a great game!

02:12.350 --> 02:16.236
That was good. Convincing.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.120
I heard you yell at the TV once.

02:20.525 --> 02:22.072
Mr. Shade.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.195
- Come with me, please.
- Who are you?

02:25.220 --> 02:27.266
Someone you're gonna want to listen to.

02:42.835 --> 02:44.934
You all wait here.

02:44.959 --> 02:47.867
- But we're missing the game!
- It's halftime.

02:49.806 --> 02:51.542
I told you not to throw that popcorn.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.372
It was a bad call.

02:54.805 --> 02:56.625
Cordell Squires!

02:56.650 --> 02:59.509
- Wait, you sent those tickets?
- Of course I did.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.196
- Thanks for coming, man.
- Yeah, you got it.

03:01.221 --> 03:03.383
- Wait, you two know each other?
- Yeah. I covered Cordy

03:03.408 --> 03:06.134
back in his NCAA days, back
when I was a broadcaster.

03:06.159 --> 03:08.039
Nobody's called me that since college.

03:08.064 --> 03:11.160
- This is my partner, Angie.
- You must be the Everett half

03:11.185 --> 03:13.820
- of Shade and Everett.
- It's actually Everett and...

03:13.905 --> 03:15.469
- Never mind.
- Listen, I gotta run

03:15.539 --> 03:17.313
to the locker room, so I'm
gonna cut to the chase.

03:17.338 --> 03:19.532
- What's up?
- I need your help with something.

03:20.098 --> 03:22.141
This picture was posted on a website

03:22.166 --> 03:24.425
- called "Daily Rumor".
- Is that...?

03:24.450 --> 03:27.544
Gabby would never step out on me.
This guy is Eric Martin.

03:27.569 --> 03:29.728
He's the manufacturing contact
for our sneaker line.

03:29.753 --> 03:31.438
They met last Monday.

03:31.525 --> 03:33.626
Buddy, you know that tabloid rumours

03:33.651 --> 03:35.814
- are just part of being famous.
- I know.

03:35.839 --> 03:38.587
Gabby says it's a waste
of time hiring Pls.

03:38.612 --> 03:40.935
Gabrielle Squires? Of Demolition?

03:40.960 --> 03:43.620
- That's our brand.
- Oh, I know. I'm a huge fan.

03:43.645 --> 03:45.734
Did you know that she took
a tiny apparel company

03:45.759 --> 03:47.875
and turned it into a half
a billion dollar empire?

03:47.900 --> 03:50.530
Yeah. I know. I know the guy, remember?

03:50.697 --> 03:52.780
It took us a decade to get where we are

03:52.805 --> 03:54.704
and rumours like this
could tank us in a month.

03:54.729 --> 03:57.088
And Gabby, she keeps up a brave face,

03:57.113 --> 03:58.681
but I know this is wearing on her.

03:58.742 --> 04:00.256
So I need you to find out
who took this picture

04:00.281 --> 04:03.396
so I can shut them down. I need
you to keep it quiet though.

04:03.564 --> 04:05.451
Nobody on my team knows
that I'm hiring you

04:05.476 --> 04:07.088
and I don't want Gabby
to find out either.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.462
Alright. We'll get on it.

04:08.487 --> 04:10.283
- Great seeing you, Shade.
- You too, buddy.

04:10.308 --> 04:12.308
- Enjoy the game.
- Thanks.

04:18.462 --> 04:20.286
This is huge!

04:20.310 --> 04:21.944
I mean, a client like Cordell Squires

04:21.969 --> 04:24.858
- could put us back on the map.
- It pays to know people.

04:24.883 --> 04:28.285
And by people I mean me.

04:30.055 --> 04:32.845
Stick with me, kid. I'm going places.

04:40.119 --> 04:43.119
Oh, yeah. Going places, alright.

05:16.761 --> 05:19.970
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:20.537 --> 05:22.595
[I've searched the
Daily Rumor website.]

05:22.620 --> 05:24.111
[None of their photos are credited.]

05:24.136 --> 05:26.668
That makes sense. If
I ever find the guy

05:26.693 --> 05:27.912
who took that photo of me on the dock

05:27.937 --> 05:30.761
at Becca's family
cottage 15 years ago...

05:30.786 --> 05:32.413
The one where you're naked
holding the moose antlers

05:32.438 --> 05:35.497
[over your head? Which
I've never seen.]

05:36.344 --> 05:38.782
Wait... So, who's the
dude with Gabrielle?

05:38.807 --> 05:40.887
His name's Eric Martin.
He's a sneaker manufacturer

05:40.912 --> 05:43.076
she works with. Do a soft
search and see if you can find

05:43.101 --> 05:45.937
- [any secrets in his closet.]
- Wait a sec.

05:47.725 --> 05:49.388
I just sent you an article.

05:49.413 --> 05:52.358
It's Cordell going bananas
on a photographer

05:52.383 --> 05:53.874
[over a month ago.]

05:53.899 --> 05:55.997
- [And again, no photo credit.]
- _

05:56.022 --> 05:58.332
They reported on the incident.
Apparently, Cordell grabbed

05:58.357 --> 06:01.820
the photographer's $25,000 lens
and bashed it against a wall.

06:01.846 --> 06:03.545
Elizabeth Moore. Freelance paparazzo.

06:03.570 --> 06:06.499
Sounds like motive to me. How
do we find this photographer?

06:06.524 --> 06:09.072
She's been taking a lot
of photos of this boxer

06:09.097 --> 06:12.232
this week. Seamus Conor. He's
in town for some big fight.

06:12.257 --> 06:14.045
Yeah, right. He's been
all over the news.

06:14.070 --> 06:16.003
- Can you find out where he's...
- [The Queen Eleanor.]

06:16.028 --> 06:19.279
- A boutique hotel in Yorkville.
- Zoe Chow for the win.

06:19.304 --> 06:20.937
Yeah.

06:22.372 --> 06:23.984
So, gun to your head...

06:24.009 --> 06:26.875
- Is Gabrielle having an affair?
- Nah.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.415
I don't buy it. I know them.
They're a team.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.376
Totally devoted to each other.

06:31.921 --> 06:33.639
At least they were.

06:34.651 --> 06:36.517
There he is.

06:36.805 --> 06:39.101
Seamus Conor. If he's here,

06:39.126 --> 06:41.425
our pesky photographer
shouldn't be too far away.

06:44.911 --> 06:47.172
And... Gotcha.

06:54.895 --> 06:57.668
Oh! For the love of all that
is holy, get out of my way!

06:57.693 --> 07:00.240
- Elizabeth Moore, I presume?
- I don't get enough credit

07:00.265 --> 07:03.312
- for not being a psychopath.
- Does this photo look familiar?

07:03.478 --> 07:05.812
Of course. It's plastered
all over the web right now.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.314
- The picture. You took it.
- No, I wish.

07:10.338 --> 07:12.239
- I heard it went for fifty grand.
- Fifty grand?

07:12.264 --> 07:14.272
Yeah. Can you believe
some regular schmuck

07:14.297 --> 07:16.989
- got the shot of the year?
- This wasn't taken by a pro?

07:17.014 --> 07:19.683
Are you kidding? Look how
poorly composed it is.

07:19.828 --> 07:21.481
What about your highly-publicized riff

07:21.506 --> 07:22.965
- with Cordell?
- Left you short

07:22.990 --> 07:24.950
of a $25,000 lens. I'd be pissed.

07:24.975 --> 07:28.219
Yeah, I was. And then, a
week later, a brand new lens

07:28.244 --> 07:30.615
arrived from Demolition
with an apology.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.527
Why do you care so much
about a photo of Gabrielle

07:32.552 --> 07:35.801
at The Jasper Arms Hotel anyway? How
do you know is The Jasper Arms?

07:35.912 --> 07:37.344
I've been photographing
celebrities there

07:37.369 --> 07:39.407
since it opened. See that wallpaper?

07:39.520 --> 07:42.098
It's in all their suites.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

07:45.925 --> 07:48.313
- Jasper Arms?
- Hmm-mm.

07:52.678 --> 07:53.951
Check it out!

07:53.976 --> 07:56.313
I will if you come back 5 steps.

07:56.338 --> 07:58.505
Right. Heights.

07:58.530 --> 08:01.174
- So cute.
- Don't patronize my fears.

08:02.228 --> 08:03.575
Definitely where the
photo was taken from.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.291
Yeah. Now all we have to do
is figure out who took it.

08:06.316 --> 08:07.935
Security cameras?

08:07.960 --> 08:10.040
Nothing pointing directly at this spot.

08:10.065 --> 08:13.635
- Parking attendant, maybe?
- Automated parking.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.919
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Maz.

08:16.254 --> 08:17.871
He's been uptight about helping lately.

08:17.903 --> 08:20.167
There's a new inspector at the
station and he's been dodging me.

08:20.192 --> 08:22.240
We'll just have to be extra convincing.

08:23.150 --> 08:25.981
No, no, no! I cannot help you.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.122
He looks like Maz. He talks like Maz.

08:28.147 --> 08:31.522
And yet, the Maz I know would
never refuse a lifelong friend...

08:31.547 --> 08:34.071
A lifelong friend who was
recently charged with espionage.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.943
- Those charges were vacated!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

08:37.392 --> 08:40.243
Detective Mazhari, you have visitors?

08:40.268 --> 08:42.648
Yes, Inspector Carson! This is... uh...

08:42.673 --> 08:45.441
my cousin... Tamantha...

08:45.466 --> 08:48.154
and her boyfriend... Earl.

08:48.543 --> 08:51.522
Pleased to meet you. I had
no idea so many people

08:51.547 --> 08:53.703
in your extended family were cops.

08:53.728 --> 08:56.895
Because we all know that only
members of the police force

08:56.920 --> 08:59.989
are allowed back here.
Isn't that right, Maz?

09:00.020 --> 09:02.265
- Yes, Inspector.
- Right.

09:06.264 --> 09:08.280
She's a treat.

09:08.612 --> 09:10.491
You two have to leave. Right now.

09:10.516 --> 09:11.700
One parking machine.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.355
All we need is the
usage for last Monday.

09:13.380 --> 09:16.176
Do you know how close I am to
being demoted to desk monkey?

09:16.201 --> 09:19.496
You'd be such a cute little
desk monkey. Alright.

09:19.521 --> 09:22.545
Fine. I... I just feel
bad for our client.

09:22.570 --> 09:25.144
Yeah, Cordell Squires is gonna
be really disappointed.

09:25.169 --> 09:28.268
Tut-tut-tut. Sit.

09:29.293 --> 09:32.670
Did you say Cordell Squires?
Are you kidding me?

09:32.695 --> 09:35.207
Well... You help us out,
we'll get you an autograph.

09:35.232 --> 09:37.567
An autograph? What am I, 10 years old?

09:38.705 --> 09:40.355
No, if I help you out,

09:40.750 --> 09:43.184
I want courtside seats
to a playout game.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.981
And I want to meet him
and not just like a

09:45.006 --> 09:46.583
"Hey! How are you doing?"
flyby type thing.

09:46.608 --> 09:49.112
I want a meaningful
interaction with us.

09:49.137 --> 09:50.803
Maybe we go for paninis and we come up

09:50.828 --> 09:52.145
with a secret handshake.
You know what I mean?

09:52.170 --> 09:54.709
Some real skin to skin contact.

09:54.734 --> 09:57.634
Kinky. But we'll see what we can do.

09:57.659 --> 10:01.287
And listen to me, you bozos.
This is the last time.

10:01.312 --> 10:03.619
Fine. Just call us when
you've got something.

10:03.945 --> 10:06.877
Come on, Earl. That jalopy
ain't gonna drive itself.

10:06.902 --> 10:10.160
- After you, Tamantha.
- What?

10:10.424 --> 10:12.063
That could be a name.

10:15.162 --> 10:18.193
Yes, yes, yes!

10:19.648 --> 10:21.917
Oh! It's perfect!

10:21.942 --> 10:23.564
Check it out.

10:23.883 --> 10:27.356
Two bedrooms, hardwood
floors, on Queen West and...

10:27.381 --> 10:29.402
a pet washing station in the basement.

10:29.427 --> 10:31.461
- You don't have any pets.
- Not yet.

10:31.486 --> 10:34.066
But you know, who knows?
Now that Maz and I

10:34.091 --> 10:36.558
are gonna be actually able
to spend more time together.

10:36.950 --> 10:39.371
- So how'd you find it?
- One of Maz's buddies

10:39.396 --> 10:41.612
is moving down south and he
had to give up the lease.

10:41.637 --> 10:45.024
Maz just sent it over. And also,

10:45.049 --> 10:48.174
this is the list of users
for that parking station.

10:49.645 --> 10:52.184
Recognize any names? I
think you'll spot it.

10:53.179 --> 10:56.009
- Demolition?
- That's the Squires' company.

10:56.034 --> 10:58.519
- Maybe Gabrielle parked there?
- But she wouldn't have to.

10:58.544 --> 11:00.752
They have a reserved parking
spot at Jasper Arms.

11:01.941 --> 11:03.765
OK, so someone from their company

11:03.790 --> 11:06.303
took this photo... But why?

11:06.328 --> 11:08.574
Maybe a coincidence they
were there that day?

11:08.599 --> 11:11.012
Don't think so. Look.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.094
Clock in the hotel room says 9:45.

11:14.119 --> 11:15.969
Charge on the credit card, 9:27.

11:15.994 --> 11:18.317
So whoever took this photo knew
Gabrielle was gonna be there.

11:18.342 --> 11:21.899
Someone from the Squires' team
isn't playing by the rules.

11:27.074 --> 11:29.209
- Here.
- What's this?

11:29.234 --> 11:31.223
It's our cover. We're with
Big League Entertainment,

11:31.248 --> 11:34.249
producing 'A Day in the Life'
segment on the Squires.

11:34.626 --> 11:36.851
Got it. Hold on a second.

11:36.876 --> 11:39.142
How come you get to be
the Executive Producer?

11:39.411 --> 11:42.503
Because you're the host or whatever.

11:51.487 --> 11:53.187
Wow...

11:53.212 --> 11:55.668
That's what I call a
diversified product line.

11:55.693 --> 11:57.944
Gabrielle's a genius.
She's basically branded

11:57.969 --> 12:00.081
every aspect of their relationship.

12:00.224 --> 12:02.335
Hey there. I'm Jacqueline Bynes.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.615
I'm the Squires' publicist. Who
scheduled you again today?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.877
Um, Cordell reached out to me directly.

12:07.902 --> 12:09.966
- We go way back. I'm Matt...
- Shade.

12:09.991 --> 12:12.893
I know. Epic fail guy.

12:12.979 --> 12:14.630
Follow me.

12:16.812 --> 12:18.848
Wait here. I'll let Cordell know.

12:24.115 --> 12:26.699
- Stop it. You're staring.
- I am not.

12:29.766 --> 12:32.574
- You're looking right at her.
- Do you have any idea

12:32.599 --> 12:35.268
how inspiring she is? She rose...

12:35.293 --> 12:39.640
- She's coming. Act normal.
- Matt Shade?

12:39.948 --> 12:41.629
Gabby! How are you?

12:41.654 --> 12:44.317
I haven't seen you since
my first year of college.

12:44.342 --> 12:45.588
What are you doing here?

12:45.613 --> 12:48.767
- My colleague and I...
- Hi. Scarlett Pierce.

12:48.792 --> 12:52.066
We're doing a Big League
doc piece on Cordell.

12:52.599 --> 12:55.189
I'm such a huge fan.

12:55.214 --> 12:58.556
Of you. Not Cordell. I mean
he's cool and all, but...

12:58.581 --> 13:00.043
He's not you.

13:00.075 --> 13:02.072
Well, Cordell didn't tell
me anything about this.

13:02.097 --> 13:03.301
Well, I'm sure he didn't want

13:03.326 --> 13:05.393
to bother you. He knows
how busy you are.

13:06.169 --> 13:08.107
Ah! Looks like he's free now.

13:08.132 --> 13:11.730
- Nice to see you again, Gabby.
- So nice to meet you.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.858
Don't worry. She doesn't
suspect anything.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.987
We said we're here doing
a reality show spot.

13:21.012 --> 13:22.559
Oh, OK. Why don't you guys come in?

13:22.584 --> 13:27.556
- Alright, guys. I need the room.
- Alright. I'll get the door.

13:32.141 --> 13:34.011
No, you too, Mims.

13:36.973 --> 13:39.921
Don't mind him. You guys have a seat.

13:41.886 --> 13:43.823
Mims has been like an older brother

13:43.848 --> 13:45.895
to my boys since high school.

13:46.464 --> 13:48.483
So...

13:49.309 --> 13:51.283
You find out who took the picture?

13:52.064 --> 13:54.447
We found out where the
picture was taken from.

13:54.599 --> 13:56.686
OK. Why does that sound like bad news?

13:56.711 --> 13:58.858
The photograph was taken
from a parking garage

13:58.883 --> 14:01.411
across the street from
The Jasper Arms Hotel.

14:01.655 --> 14:03.574
Your company credit card was
used to pay for parking

14:03.599 --> 14:07.231
- at roughly the same time.
- Hold up.

14:08.741 --> 14:11.254
You're trying to say somebody from
Demolition took that picture?

14:11.279 --> 14:13.059
Have you been in a fight
with anyone recently?

14:13.084 --> 14:15.270
Maybe someone holding a grudge?

14:15.295 --> 14:16.785
No.

14:16.819 --> 14:19.431
No, everybody who works for
me and Gabby is like family.

14:19.456 --> 14:21.573
I'm serious, nobody would do this.

14:22.169 --> 14:23.598
How about this? See for yourself.

14:23.623 --> 14:27.195
We're having a launch party tonight
for our new bottled water.

14:27.220 --> 14:29.157
Trying to quell the
rumours about this photo.

14:29.182 --> 14:31.416
Why don't you guys come?
Meet everybody.

14:31.441 --> 14:33.474
Sure. Yeah, we could do that.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.295
But maybe you could start by telling us

14:35.320 --> 14:37.451
how many people had access
to the corporate card.

14:39.032 --> 14:40.858
57 people?!

14:41.366 --> 14:44.786
- Yeah. So who're we looking at?
- OK.

14:44.811 --> 14:46.455
Personal trainer, uh...

14:46.480 --> 14:49.125
physiotherapist,
personal chef, nanny...

14:49.150 --> 14:51.368
Woah, woah. They don't have kids.

14:51.393 --> 14:53.340
Nanny for their dogs.

14:54.097 --> 14:57.398
Cordell's manager, brand
rep, party planner,

14:57.423 --> 14:59.942
- DJ, publicist...
- Zoe, we get the idea.

15:00.404 --> 15:02.703
How do we narrow this down? Well...

15:02.728 --> 15:04.550
Cordell was playing out of
town when the photo was taken,

15:04.575 --> 15:07.015
so between social media and that,

15:07.040 --> 15:08.897
I was able to eliminate 38 people.

15:08.922 --> 15:11.259
- OK, so that leaves 15...
- 19.

15:11.284 --> 15:13.662
19 unaccounted for.

15:13.687 --> 15:15.681
Yes and luckily, they're
all going to be

15:15.706 --> 15:18.266
- at the event tonight.
- What about our sneaker guy?

15:18.291 --> 15:20.754
You mean this guy? The
factory he owns is in China.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.433
I found it easily enough off
the Demolition website,

15:23.458 --> 15:25.645
but I'm still having a hard
time tracking him down.

15:25.670 --> 15:28.950
- Well... Keep digging, Zoe.
- I will.

15:29.408 --> 15:31.349
Oh! Um... After...

15:31.374 --> 15:33.908
the break that I'm about to
ask which you're totally

15:33.933 --> 15:35.834
going to say yes to because
you're the best bosses

15:35.859 --> 15:39.410
- in the world.
- Go look at the apartment, Zoe.

15:39.435 --> 15:42.862
- Thank you!
- Good luck.

16:01.883 --> 16:04.877
It's about time!

16:13.082 --> 16:15.605
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

16:15.946 --> 16:18.458
It was gonna fall in the pool.

16:26.994 --> 16:30.403
- So how do you want to play this?
- Well... You talk,

16:30.428 --> 16:32.371
I'll film. Just get them to
tell you where they were

16:32.396 --> 16:34.633
last Monday around the
time that photo was taken.

16:34.658 --> 16:37.568
- Sure. Piece of cake.
- Alright.

16:37.593 --> 16:40.339
So you guys are set
up to do your thing.

16:40.364 --> 16:42.894
I let the entourage know that
you'll be speaking with them.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.203
- Perfect.
- I just need to know

16:44.227 --> 16:45.867
what types of questions
you'll be asking.

16:45.892 --> 16:47.260
Oh! You know...

16:47.286 --> 16:48.875
- Day in the life stuff.
- You know,

16:48.900 --> 16:51.196
you are such a vital part of the brand,

16:51.221 --> 16:53.745
why don't you start with you.
Tell us about your day.

16:53.770 --> 16:56.013
Say... Last Monday?

16:56.038 --> 16:58.188
Oh! Worst day ever.

16:58.213 --> 17:00.305
I got a flat on the 403

17:00.330 --> 17:02.430
and was nearly late for
a book layout meeting.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.301
Um... Ha! Ha! Ha! Not
that interesting, huh?

17:06.521 --> 17:08.756
Let me know if I can do
anything else for you.

17:19.268 --> 17:21.823
- I saw that!
- You saw nothing.

17:22.832 --> 17:26.099
Day in the life is like this, yo.
We fly to Ibiza to party

17:26.125 --> 17:28.061
during one of my sets.
Cordell, he gets up on stage

17:28.087 --> 17:30.554
and starts spinning with me.
Gabster started dancing

17:30.579 --> 17:32.842
with her ladies. You feel me?

17:33.171 --> 17:34.897
Yeah....

17:34.922 --> 17:37.556
Maybe you could tell me about
a slightly more normal day.

17:37.581 --> 17:39.879
Like... maybe last Monday.

17:39.904 --> 17:42.352
Slept in 'til about 6 pm.

17:42.377 --> 17:44.170
Then went for a falafel with the boys.

17:44.195 --> 17:46.754
- Falafel?
- Vegan is the new black.

17:46.952 --> 17:49.184
I didn't properly
introduce myself earlier.

17:49.209 --> 17:50.914
I'm Anastasia, Gabrielle's cousin

17:50.939 --> 17:53.335
- and primary assistant.
- So you and Gabrielle

17:53.360 --> 17:54.960
must be together constantly.

17:54.985 --> 17:57.401
- Attached at the hip.
- Were you with her

17:57.426 --> 18:01.289
at The Jasper Arms last Monday?
She had a meeting there.

18:01.773 --> 18:04.849
You expect me to remember her
entire schedule and mine?

18:04.874 --> 18:06.736
Isn't that your job?

18:06.761 --> 18:10.056
I was sick that day. Stomach flu.

18:10.081 --> 18:11.971
Is that glamorous enough for you?

18:12.163 --> 18:15.169
You take care of Cordell's
Instagram account?

18:15.194 --> 18:16.879
That's right. I take the photos,

18:16.904 --> 18:19.511
come up with the filters,
choose the captions.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.166
Until Mims changes them, of course.

18:22.656 --> 18:23.956
Wow!

18:23.981 --> 18:27.329
Moocher Mims is actually paying
for something. That's a first.

18:27.354 --> 18:29.578
- Why do you say that?
- Let's just say

18:29.603 --> 18:32.181
he'll bet on anything and
he ain't ever lucky.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.557
Does Cordell know about that?

18:34.582 --> 18:37.019
Cordell's got a soft spot for
the boys who were with him

18:37.044 --> 18:40.520
when he first started.
Mims, he takes advantage.

18:40.545 --> 18:43.045
To be honest, I think he's jealous.

18:43.169 --> 18:44.886
Cordell got everything he ever wanted.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.001
You know it is definitely Mims, right?

18:51.026 --> 18:53.319
Guy with a gambling
problem suddenly flush.

18:53.344 --> 18:55.643
- Likes to bend the rules.
- That would be

18:55.668 --> 18:57.763
a serious violation of the Bro-code.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.499
When my high school
buddies moved to Chicago

18:59.524 --> 19:02.242
in my playing days, every
one of them had my back.

19:02.302 --> 19:05.321
I'm sorry. Did you just say
that you had an entourage?

19:05.346 --> 19:08.595
Friends, Everett. You
should try them out.

19:09.143 --> 19:11.419
What about Anastasia, uh?

19:11.613 --> 19:14.100
"I was home sick" isn't
exactly an alibi.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.420
Yeah, sure, Anastasia wants
to be in the limelight,

19:16.445 --> 19:19.814
but look at her. I mean, she
absolutely adores Gabrielle.

19:19.839 --> 19:23.717
- I'm telling you, it's Mims.
- Here he comes.

20:05.647 --> 20:08.326
- What's he doing back here?
- Cordell mentioned he works

20:08.351 --> 20:10.907
out of a back office near the
locker room sometimes...

20:10.932 --> 20:12.999
But why so late at night?

20:13.842 --> 20:15.445
Because he's the leak.

20:15.470 --> 20:17.654
And we're gonna catch him in the act.

20:58.922 --> 21:01.401
Looks like we found our inside man.

21:03.232 --> 21:07.120
- Oh!
- Come here!

21:09.590 --> 21:13.125
- Get off...
- Ow!

21:13.150 --> 21:15.529
Shh!

21:22.303 --> 21:24.330
Let's never speak of this moment.

21:24.355 --> 21:26.411
Agreed.

21:41.627 --> 21:43.698
Is that a Daily Rumor guy?

21:45.616 --> 21:47.681
Don't let the door hit
you on the way out.

21:48.942 --> 21:52.677
- Unbelievable.
- What are you two doing here?

21:52.701 --> 21:55.156
- How's the photo business Mims?
- I don't know

21:55.181 --> 21:56.954
what you're talking about, Little Mama.

21:56.979 --> 21:58.766
We saw you selling
more Gabrielle photos

21:58.791 --> 22:01.157
- to that reporter.
- Hey, my man!

22:02.694 --> 22:04.319
Photos of Cordell...

22:05.140 --> 22:06.600
What, you signed these?

22:06.625 --> 22:09.354
You know, the more I think about
it, you two ain't no TV producers.

22:09.379 --> 22:11.195
We're investigating who took
the picture of Gabrielle

22:11.220 --> 22:13.132
and leaked it to the Daily Rumor site.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.340
Well, I would never sell out

22:14.365 --> 22:16.365
my boy or his girl like that. Period!

22:16.390 --> 22:18.521
Really? Is that why you're sneaking
around behind Cordell's back,

22:18.546 --> 22:20.935
- selling his MVP trophies?
- I ain't sneaking around

22:20.960 --> 22:23.905
and these ain't MVP trophies.
This is from high school, man!

22:24.196 --> 22:25.768
Besides, Cordell knows about it.

22:25.793 --> 22:27.851
Does he know you're
forging his signature?

22:28.863 --> 22:31.599
Where were you the day
Gabrielle's photo was taken?

22:32.076 --> 22:34.308
Anastasia and I were at...

22:34.514 --> 22:37.217
her place in the West End
doing kung fu business.

22:37.985 --> 22:39.218
Funny.

22:39.243 --> 22:41.523
- Anastasia said she was sick.
- Yeah, of course she did,

22:41.548 --> 22:44.410
cause, you know, Cordell and Gabby
have a strict "no messing around

22:44.435 --> 22:46.785
with your colleagues" policy. Gabby
would kill us if she found out!

22:46.810 --> 22:47.803
Matter of fact, you know what?

22:47.828 --> 22:50.089
We don't have to... tell Cordell

22:50.114 --> 22:53.486
- about any of this, right?
- No.

22:53.511 --> 22:56.993
We won't, but... you should.

22:57.018 --> 23:00.176
You own him that at least.

23:02.125 --> 23:04.615
Oh! Anastasia's building
confirmed that Mims

23:04.647 --> 23:06.786
- was there Monday.
- So, basically,

23:06.811 --> 23:09.930
- everyone has an alibi.
- We need to start over.

23:09.955 --> 23:12.346
We need to review their
entire entourage.

23:12.496 --> 23:15.731
Of course... Why didn't
I think of that before?

23:15.756 --> 23:17.852
- What have you got?
- Eric Martin,

23:17.877 --> 23:21.389
the shoe manufacturer. His
real name is Xiang Mau.

23:21.414 --> 23:23.396
He just uses an English name
when he's doing business here

23:23.421 --> 23:25.099
to make it easier for you white folks.

23:25.124 --> 23:27.157
That's why I couldn't find him before.

23:27.182 --> 23:30.553
OK, but... that's not the guy
in the photo with Gabrielle.

23:31.226 --> 23:33.332
I don't get it. Why
would Cordell send us

23:33.357 --> 23:35.414
- on a wild goose chase?
- Maybe he didn't.

23:35.438 --> 23:37.365
Maybe he just believed
what Gabrielle told him.

23:37.390 --> 23:38.879
So... who's the guy

23:38.905 --> 23:40.701
- in the picture?
- I don't know.

23:40.726 --> 23:42.630
We need to take this to Cordell.

23:42.936 --> 23:45.485
- Let me go and talk to him.
- Fine, but...

23:45.510 --> 23:47.200
Just be careful, OK?
We can't risk anything

23:47.225 --> 23:49.794
happening to this case.
It's too important.

23:54.957 --> 23:58.229
- Zoe, what's wrong?
- Uh? No, nothing. Nothing.

23:58.254 --> 24:00.216
The... the lease for the
apartment just came in.

24:00.241 --> 24:03.278
- Well, that's great, isn't it?
- Yeah. It's fantastic.

24:03.303 --> 24:05.037
I mean, there's no reason
why someone wouldn't want

24:05.062 --> 24:08.443
- to live there.
- And yet?

24:10.017 --> 24:11.879
Maz and I fight all the time.

24:11.904 --> 24:13.622
We're already arguing
about the apartment and

24:13.647 --> 24:14.974
we haven't even moved in!

24:14.999 --> 24:17.650
I just thought living together
would solve everything.

24:18.186 --> 24:21.097
My cousin Rachel, her
and her ex, they...

24:21.178 --> 24:22.664
They started fighting a couple years

24:22.689 --> 24:24.263
into their relationship,
so they got engaged.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.964
And then, they fought more...
so they got married.

24:26.989 --> 24:29.833
And then they figured: "Hey,
now we hate each other.

24:29.858 --> 24:32.293
Let's have a kid!" They
kept thinking it would be

24:32.318 --> 24:35.450
a fresh start, but it never worked.

24:35.941 --> 24:39.172
So... What should I do?

24:40.059 --> 24:42.487
I think you already know.

24:46.614 --> 24:49.595
Excuse me. Hey... Is Cordell here?

24:49.620 --> 24:52.105
I sent him a text but
he hasn't responded.

24:52.130 --> 24:54.802
Uh, no. He stepped out for a
last-minute team meeting.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.278
Will you tell him I'm looking for him?
Thanks.

24:57.758 --> 25:00.287
Shade! How's the doc coming along?

25:00.312 --> 25:04.510
- Uh... We may have hit a snag.
- I know that look.

25:04.847 --> 25:06.626
You've got something on your mind.

25:06.651 --> 25:08.643
Come on, let's talk.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.770
Look at you!

25:19.536 --> 25:21.605
That was my last year of high school.

25:21.630 --> 25:22.932
I played the national anthem

25:22.957 --> 25:25.930
- for our homecoming game.
- You still play?

25:26.448 --> 25:28.453
Oh, my God! Not in years.

25:28.478 --> 25:30.466
My schedule's just too crazy.

25:30.491 --> 25:32.785
Now we've got the water
launch and the shoes...

25:32.810 --> 25:34.910
- It's...
- With the Chinese...

25:34.935 --> 25:38.386
- manufacturer, right?
- Yeah.

25:41.251 --> 25:43.304
You know what? I just remembered

25:43.329 --> 25:45.225
I have an appointment I have to be at.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.409
- I'll let you get back to work.
- I thought

25:47.434 --> 25:50.316
- you were coming to see Cordell.
- It can wait.

25:50.616 --> 25:53.386
Stop it, Shade. What's going on?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.736
You're not doing a
documentary on Cordell.

25:59.342 --> 26:01.565
I'm a private investigator now.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.962
My partner and I were hired to find out

26:04.987 --> 26:07.415
who took that picture and
sold it to the Daily Rumor.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.831
Cordell hired you after
I told him not to.

26:09.856 --> 26:12.573
- He's trying to protect you.
- He needs to leave this alone.

26:12.598 --> 26:15.261
And so do you. Look,
here's the thing...

26:16.174 --> 26:18.831
I know the guy in the
picture isn't Eric Martin.

26:19.201 --> 26:21.405
- Have you told Cordell?
- Not yet.

26:21.430 --> 26:24.347
- But he will want an explanation.
- I'll talk to him.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.847
- Will you?
- This is none of your business, Shade.

26:27.872 --> 26:30.232
It kind of is. We were
hired specifically...

26:30.257 --> 26:32.862
I don't give a damn why you were hired!
This is my life

26:32.887 --> 26:35.713
we're talking about! And Cordell's.
Get out!

26:35.738 --> 26:38.274
- Gabby! You can't...
- I said get out!

26:38.996 --> 26:40.884
You're fired!

26:53.894 --> 26:56.369
- You got us fired?
- No!

26:56.394 --> 26:58.410
Technically, she's not our client.

26:58.435 --> 27:01.004
Technically? You got us fired

27:01.029 --> 27:03.231
and you caused a rift between
our client and his wife

27:03.256 --> 27:05.415
for no reason! What were you thinking?

27:05.440 --> 27:07.521
I went over there to talk to Cordell.

27:07.546 --> 27:09.522
She was there instead.
She caught on to me

27:09.547 --> 27:13.588
- So I tried to get to the truth.
- You blew our case, Shade.

27:13.613 --> 27:15.880
We needed this. We needed it big time!

27:16.110 --> 27:19.136
No. You needed it.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.542
OK. Time to go.

27:22.806 --> 27:24.248
We're fine.

27:24.273 --> 27:26.515
The Agency is gonna get through this.

27:26.540 --> 27:29.784
The agency's reputation's
tanked because of me.

27:30.058 --> 27:31.738
And we're in debt because of me.

27:31.763 --> 27:33.668
You remortgaged your house...
because of me.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.239
Everett...

27:35.686 --> 27:38.940
It's not your debt, it's our debt.

27:38.965 --> 27:40.573
OK? And it's not your reputation,

27:40.598 --> 27:44.298
it's our reputation. And
it's not my mortgage...

27:45.667 --> 27:47.448
OK, it is still my mortgage.

27:47.473 --> 27:50.714
But the point is...
whatever happens here,

27:50.739 --> 27:54.410
it doesn't just happen to you,
it happens to both of us.

27:54.435 --> 27:56.419
That just makes it worse.

27:56.444 --> 27:59.876
No, it doesn't. We're a team.

27:59.901 --> 28:02.630
And when we get that win, your win,

28:02.860 --> 28:05.496
it'll be ours, not mine.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.100
Did that make sense?

28:09.125 --> 28:11.287
No. Not really.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.378
But it was a good speech up until then.

28:13.403 --> 28:15.511
Yeah, thanks.

28:17.097 --> 28:18.930
Look, I'll go see Cordell.

28:18.955 --> 28:21.315
I'll figure out a way
to smooth this over.

28:22.191 --> 28:23.806
Wait.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.155
We'll both go.

28:42.984 --> 28:46.730
- Cordell! Hey, man.
- What're you guys doing here?

28:47.651 --> 28:49.472
You haven't talked to Gabby?

28:49.497 --> 28:51.222
Uh... Since when? Why?

28:51.247 --> 28:53.514
Uh... Listen. Um...

28:53.539 --> 28:55.885
We don't want to throw you off
your game during this playoffs,

28:55.910 --> 28:58.362
but... we can't keep this from you.

28:58.387 --> 29:00.795
The guy in the photo with Gabrielle,

29:01.056 --> 29:02.670
that's not Eric Martin.

29:02.695 --> 29:04.100
OK.

29:04.299 --> 29:06.299
- Who is it?
- We don't know.

29:06.394 --> 29:07.923
Shade went to see you,
you weren't there.

29:07.948 --> 29:11.080
He ran into Gabrielle and...
she fired us.

29:12.992 --> 29:14.565
Well, I guess that explains
why she didn't want

29:14.590 --> 29:16.797
to hire Pis in the first place.

29:19.706 --> 29:21.716
God!

29:23.198 --> 29:24.661
You know, we've been drifting apart

29:24.686 --> 29:27.257
the past few years.
Conflicting schedules

29:27.282 --> 29:29.643
and different business ventures, but...

29:30.873 --> 29:33.040
I never thought she'd cheat on me.

29:33.237 --> 29:34.678
I mean, what are we? Just a brand

29:34.703 --> 29:36.801
- with nothing behind it?
- Just hold on.

29:36.826 --> 29:38.917
OK? Don't get ahead of yourself.

29:39.596 --> 29:41.697
This doesn't feel like the
slimy infidelity cases

29:41.722 --> 29:44.796
I deal with all year round.
It really feels there's more

29:44.821 --> 29:46.737
- to this story.
- You focus on winning

29:46.762 --> 29:50.409
this playoff series. We will find
out who the guy in the photo is and

29:50.574 --> 29:53.939
- what's really going on, OK?
- Yeah.

30:01.499 --> 30:05.098
So, got any ideas on how to ID
the mystery man in the picture?

30:05.123 --> 30:07.220
We could show it around Demolition.

30:07.883 --> 30:10.250
It was published on the
Daily Rumor website.

30:10.275 --> 30:11.433
You'd think if someone knew

30:11.458 --> 30:13.009
who it was they'd have
mentioned it to Cordell.

30:13.034 --> 30:16.044
What about The Jasper Arms?
Maybe they have a guest name.

30:16.069 --> 30:18.042
I'm betting Gabrielle booked the room.
And even then,

30:18.067 --> 30:20.340
I don't know if the
hotel would tell us.

30:20.898 --> 30:22.875
There is another possibility.

30:22.958 --> 30:24.902
It's a bit of a long shot, but...

30:24.927 --> 30:26.331
maybe worth a try.

30:33.804 --> 30:35.896
OK, Shade. Go ahead.

30:36.650 --> 30:39.699
Copy that.

30:42.728 --> 30:45.034
What the hell?

31:01.325 --> 31:02.705
OK.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.850
[I got the license plates.
I'm texting them to Maz.]

31:04.875 --> 31:08.873
Let's boogie.

31:13.386 --> 31:16.414
Yes, Maz. We're outside right now.

31:17.007 --> 31:20.057
I know! We'll get you
skin-to-skin contact!

31:20.082 --> 31:22.374
God!

31:22.399 --> 31:24.733
I thought we were cut off
from running license plates.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.870
Apparently he really
likes Cordell Squires.

31:26.895 --> 31:30.550
Ha! Ha! Ha! Are we sure
this is the right address?

31:30.575 --> 31:32.461
The other two were rental cars.

31:32.486 --> 31:34.402
And there's this.

31:34.501 --> 31:37.497
- That's the guy from the photo.
- Gary McHenry.

31:37.522 --> 31:39.260
Zoe looked him up once
we had the address.

31:39.285 --> 31:41.802
- He's an engineer.
- Any connection to Gabrielle?

31:41.827 --> 31:44.103
- None that I could find.
- Huh.

31:44.128 --> 31:45.924
Guess we're gonna have
to go old school.

31:45.949 --> 31:47.590
OK.

32:25.091 --> 32:27.273
Yeah... I don't buy it.

32:27.298 --> 32:30.112
- No way this guy is Gab's type.
- You think?

32:30.773 --> 32:32.273
Dad!

32:32.298 --> 32:34.682
Mom said don't forget to
put the bricks on top

32:34.707 --> 32:37.612
- because of the raccoons.
- I'll do it when we get home.

32:37.897 --> 32:40.303
Come on, honey. We're
gonna be late, kiddo.

32:45.257 --> 32:47.992
- Wait... The violin...
- What?

32:51.589 --> 32:53.534
Angie, look.

32:53.819 --> 32:56.879
- Is that Gabrielle?
- When she was thirteen.

32:56.904 --> 32:59.905
It's a heck of a resemblance
if I do say so myself.

32:59.930 --> 33:01.826
Think about it. The age works.

33:01.851 --> 33:04.760
- That girl's clearly adopted.
- And musical talent

33:04.785 --> 33:08.060
is a hereditary trait. Oh, my god!

33:08.450 --> 33:10.758
Is that Gabrielle's
biological daughter?

33:22.034 --> 33:24.152
So you figured it out.

33:24.177 --> 33:26.195
Not the whole story.

33:26.842 --> 33:29.563
- Does Cordell know?
- Not our place.

33:29.588 --> 33:31.491
We thought you would want to tell him.

33:32.251 --> 33:34.255
I didn't want to derail his game.

33:34.737 --> 33:37.133
I was going to tell him as
soon as playoffs were over...

33:37.662 --> 33:39.519
Tell me about what?

33:40.145 --> 33:42.143
You're hiding something from me.

33:42.743 --> 33:44.597
I needed time to figure things out.

33:44.622 --> 33:47.190
You lied to me about the
guy in the picture.

33:47.215 --> 33:49.595
You hired Pis when what you
needed to do was trust me.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.047
- Who's the guy in the picture?
- Don't you raise your voice at me!

33:52.072 --> 33:54.344
Guys. Take a breath.

33:55.968 --> 33:59.049
- Have a seat, Cordell.
- No, I'm fine standing. Thanks.

34:01.161 --> 34:04.875
When I was 17, I had a baby, Cordell.

34:05.215 --> 34:07.235
By a guy I barely knew.

34:08.010 --> 34:09.292
And I gave her up for adoption

34:09.317 --> 34:11.956
to a wonderful family I met
through social services.

34:11.981 --> 34:14.469
Whoa, whoa... What are you
saying to me right now?

34:14.494 --> 34:17.217
The man in the photo is
her adoptive father.

34:17.299 --> 34:19.309
He e-mailed me a few weeks ago.

34:19.594 --> 34:21.500
Ruby's 13 now.

34:22.119 --> 34:23.657
That's what they named her.

34:23.681 --> 34:25.772
She asked if she could meet with me.

34:26.154 --> 34:29.219
I met with Gary at the Jasper
Arms to talk it through.

34:30.467 --> 34:32.524
Why didn't you tell me about this?

34:32.917 --> 34:34.978
I always meant to. But...

34:36.237 --> 34:38.353
it was never the right time and...

34:38.379 --> 34:40.279
and the secret just snowballed.

34:41.350 --> 34:42.735
I'm sorry.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.664
I am so sorry.

34:52.074 --> 34:53.643
It's alright.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.563
We got away from each other.

34:55.830 --> 34:58.803
We'll make it work. I promise.

35:04.601 --> 35:07.015
I didn't think I was
ever gonna meet her.

35:07.937 --> 35:11.068
And now she wants to meet me and...

35:11.386 --> 35:13.032
I want to meet her.

35:13.057 --> 35:15.480
It's OK. I'm here.

35:16.325 --> 35:18.585
I'm here for all of
this stuff, alright?

35:18.858 --> 35:20.894
We're gonna be OK.

35:29.915 --> 35:32.259
We need to figure out
who took this picture.

35:32.934 --> 35:35.886
I don't want them getting all
up in some innocent kid's face.

35:36.066 --> 35:38.121
Yeah... Gabrielle...

35:38.146 --> 35:40.770
Can you walk us through the
day the photo was taken?

35:41.381 --> 35:42.924
I went to the gym,

35:42.949 --> 35:45.241
I had a breakfast meeting
about endorsements,

35:45.416 --> 35:46.788
I came here to do some paperwork

35:46.813 --> 35:48.989
and then I met Gary at The Jasper Arms.

35:49.014 --> 35:50.947
Did anything unusual happen?

35:51.161 --> 35:53.106
- No.
- Nothing?

35:53.131 --> 35:55.485
Even the smallest detail could help.

35:56.005 --> 35:58.828
Well, the concierge from
The Jasper Arms called me

35:58.853 --> 36:00.508
and told me that my
booking had changed,

36:00.533 --> 36:03.016
but they had okayed
it with my assistant.

36:03.041 --> 36:04.047
Anastasia?

36:04.072 --> 36:07.055
Yes. She's the point person
for The Jasper Arms bookings.

36:07.656 --> 36:09.618
But Anastasia was out sick that day.

36:09.643 --> 36:13.368
- She had stomach flu.
- So who spoke to the concierge?

36:13.599 --> 36:15.133
If Anastasia doesn't answer her phone,

36:15.158 --> 36:17.844
- do the calls get forwarded?
- I have no idea.

36:17.869 --> 36:21.008
Let's find out. Will
you send her a text

36:21.033 --> 36:23.100
and tell her not to answer her phone?

36:23.618 --> 36:26.086
Let me see her number.

36:28.633 --> 36:31.106
Oh, hello!

36:31.169 --> 36:33.710
This is George from the concierge desk

36:33.735 --> 36:35.938
at The Jasper Arms Hotel.

36:35.963 --> 36:37.383
Yes, I'm just calling to confirm

36:37.408 --> 36:40.477
that room 502 will be
acceptable to Mrs. Squires

36:40.502 --> 36:42.903
for her meeting this evening.

36:43.255 --> 36:45.618
Yes, it's booked for 9pm.

36:46.104 --> 36:48.711
Yes. Thank you.

36:58.644 --> 37:00.399
Going for round two, Jacqueline?

37:00.424 --> 37:02.618
Maybe this one will go for
more than fifty grand.

37:02.908 --> 37:05.032
What are you two doing here?

37:07.602 --> 37:09.711
Wow! There's a lot of good ones here.

37:09.736 --> 37:11.688
You have been following
Gabrielle for a while.

37:11.713 --> 37:12.969
You set me up.

37:12.994 --> 37:14.415
You set yourself up.

37:15.055 --> 37:17.759
What could you possibly
have to say for yourself?

37:20.978 --> 37:23.000
Five years I spent building your brand

37:23.025 --> 37:25.586
and then you decide to
drop me, just like that?

37:25.611 --> 37:29.380
- What are you talking about?
- I saw the resumes. On your desk.

37:29.405 --> 37:31.222
Piles of publicists looking for work.

37:31.247 --> 37:32.902
Oh, my God. And you thought...

37:32.927 --> 37:34.664
Jacqueline, we were
going to promote you.

37:34.689 --> 37:37.292
We're reorganizing the
entire lifestyle division.

37:37.317 --> 37:38.995
Yeah, you were going to be at the helm.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.644
We were just waiting for
the legal work to clear.

37:40.669 --> 37:41.792
But you guys

37:41.817 --> 37:43.917
were so secretive, I... I thought...

37:43.942 --> 37:45.511
I'm sorry I started looking
for your replacement

37:45.536 --> 37:48.886
before I let you in on the plan.
That's on me.

37:49.321 --> 37:52.862
But your crazy response?
That is on you, girl.

37:53.762 --> 37:55.355
Better get going.

37:55.380 --> 37:59.097
You got a new job to look for
and the competition is fierce.

38:07.958 --> 38:10.081
See? That's why I love you.

38:15.119 --> 38:16.433
Thank you.

38:16.458 --> 38:18.122
Hey, buddy.

38:21.829 --> 38:23.714
They do make a great team.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.991
I got it! I printed out
the lease agreement.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.414
Tommy said the property manager

38:38.439 --> 38:40.962
needs it signed by the
end of the day, so...

38:43.582 --> 38:45.878
- Great. Awesome. Uh...
- Yeah.

38:46.632 --> 38:48.996
- I just need to go get a pen.
- OK.

38:49.021 --> 38:51.534
Um... There's one right here.

38:52.683 --> 38:54.609
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Here you go.

38:54.634 --> 38:56.849
You found a pen. You're so helpful.

38:56.874 --> 38:58.989
- It's all pretty standard. You know.
- Yeah.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.868
Something wrong?

39:05.089 --> 39:08.151
- You haven't sign it.
- Oh! Yeah. No, I... You know...

39:08.176 --> 39:09.956
I just... It's freshly
printed, I didn't want to...

39:09.981 --> 39:11.551
- After you.
- Oh... I'd say...

39:11.576 --> 39:14.023
I'll go ladies first. How about that?
Alright?

39:14.048 --> 39:16.885
What are we doing here?

39:16.910 --> 39:18.645
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

39:18.670 --> 39:20.207
Do you really want to move in with me?

39:20.232 --> 39:22.020
Do you really want to move in with me?

39:22.045 --> 39:23.485
Listen, I've been thinking

39:23.510 --> 39:25.749
about the last time things were really

39:25.774 --> 39:29.807
consistently good and happy...
with us...

39:29.832 --> 39:31.778
It really seems like it's
been a while, right?

39:31.803 --> 39:34.104
- Since before we were serious.
- Yeah.

39:34.129 --> 39:36.000
Because it was...

39:36.525 --> 39:38.661
uncomplicated

39:38.686 --> 39:41.137
and blissfully free of expectations.

39:41.162 --> 39:42.755
- But now...
- Lots of complications.

39:42.779 --> 39:44.677
Lots of expectations.

39:45.856 --> 39:48.622
So what do you propose we do here?

39:49.356 --> 39:51.153
I think we both know.

39:52.119 --> 39:53.838
Break up?

39:54.359 --> 39:55.739
Is it... Break up?

39:55.764 --> 39:58.180
Wait, wait, think about it.

39:58.543 --> 40:00.169
We'll be better to each other, right?

40:00.194 --> 40:03.995
And we'll... even be better people
probably if... if we were just...

40:04.020 --> 40:06.284
- Friends? Yeah?
- Yes! Yes.

40:06.309 --> 40:07.678
- Yeah, OK.
- Friends!

40:07.703 --> 40:09.325
- Yeah, we'll be friends.
- We can be friends.

40:09.350 --> 40:12.116
- OK, friends. Great. OK.
- OK.

40:14.041 --> 40:16.342
Yeah.

40:19.247 --> 40:20.813
Story's out!

40:20.838 --> 40:22.717
That was fast.

40:22.862 --> 40:25.095
"Cordell and Gabrielle
talk intimate details

40:25.120 --> 40:27.270
"of their relationship and a secret

40:27.295 --> 40:29.816
- kept for 13 years."
- We got a shout out.

40:29.841 --> 40:32.501
- What? Where?
- Second paragraph.

40:35.414 --> 40:37.158
You got to be kidding me.

40:37.183 --> 40:38.961
They called us Shade & Everett?

40:38.986 --> 40:41.999
It's got a nice ring, don't you think?
Ha! Ha! Ha!

40:42.024 --> 40:43.934
Come on, be nice or I won't show you

40:43.959 --> 40:45.892
the present that Gabby
and Cordell sent over.

40:45.917 --> 40:48.165
In addition to the fat check?

40:49.363 --> 40:51.807
Oh! Cool.

40:52.341 --> 40:55.085
"Cool"? Do you know what these are?

40:55.110 --> 40:56.631
These are courtside tickets

40:56.656 --> 40:59.147
to Game seven of their playoff series.

41:00.010 --> 41:01.603
Yay?

41:01.933 --> 41:04.812
- You don't want to go.
- No, I do.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.614
I see that blue folder
sticking out of your purse.

41:06.639 --> 41:10.005
- You'd rather be working on a case.
- No. No! We'll go to the game.

41:10.030 --> 41:12.636
It'll be fun. We'll... eat hotdogs.

41:12.774 --> 41:14.412
Yay!

41:17.509 --> 41:19.249
I got a better idea.

41:34.196 --> 41:36.330
I can't believe Shade and
Angie got us these seats.

41:36.355 --> 41:38.872
- I can't believe they're not here!
- I know. They're Cray.

41:41.521 --> 41:43.042
Cray?

41:44.748 --> 41:46.770
- Are you guys enjoying yourselves?
- Yeah.

41:46.795 --> 41:48.270
- Good.
- Thank you so much.

42:05.305 --> 42:09.221
Oh, my God! Wouh! Take that! Take that!

42:17.390 --> 42:19.811
Thank you so much again
for bringing us.

42:19.836 --> 42:22.614
Anytime. We'll have
to hang out soon, OK?

42:22.639 --> 42:24.830
Hey, yeah! That's great!
Hey, you like the...

42:24.855 --> 42:28.411
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:29.154 --> 42:33.033
So glad you guys could come.
Come on, come on.

42:33.058 --> 42:35.191
Let's get you guys on the...
There you go. You're on.

42:48.436 --> 42:50.782
There he is! Oh!

42:50.976 --> 42:54.815
Mrs. Kowalski was right, wasn't she?

42:57.645 --> 43:00.066
See? You're fine.

43:00.621 --> 43:03.503
- What do you mean?
- After, you know...

43:04.553 --> 43:06.743
It threatened everything I love.

43:09.206 --> 43:11.566
About the job. The Agency.

43:12.424 --> 43:14.519
You don't always have
to be perfect, Everett

43:14.724 --> 43:16.715
You just have to stay in the game.

43:17.850 --> 43:19.569
You think I'm perfect?

43:19.796 --> 43:21.935
That's not what I said.

43:21.960 --> 43:23.950
It must be hard

43:23.975 --> 43:26.103
being around someone so
perfect all the time.

43:26.128 --> 43:28.647
And we're back.
