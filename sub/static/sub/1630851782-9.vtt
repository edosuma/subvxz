WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:05.614
It's been 48 hours since
Special Agent William Greene,

00:05.657 --> 00:07.572
a high-level
government official,

00:07.616 --> 00:09.618
was seen being thrown out
of Detroit's

00:09.661 --> 00:11.620
Bois Blanc Hotel window

00:11.663 --> 00:13.274
by this mere girl.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.667
She has been identified
as Mildred Bell,

00:15.711 --> 00:18.061
last seen in
Sebastopol, California

00:18.105 --> 00:19.671
in 1972.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.499
But what's really
gripped us all

00:21.543 --> 00:23.110
was the fact that Miss Bell

00:23.153 --> 00:26.026
committed this horrendous
act of violence

00:26.069 --> 00:27.418
telekinetically.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.203
Ever since they
landed on Belle Isle

00:29.246 --> 00:30.856
seven weeks ago,

00:30.900 --> 00:33.468
the 4,400 have been
in the public's eye

00:33.511 --> 00:34.773
and imagination.

00:34.817 --> 00:35.861
And we were there,

00:35.905 --> 00:36.906
broadcasting to you live,

00:36.949 --> 00:38.342
as our cameras

00:38.386 --> 00:39.561
captured the secret

00:39.604 --> 00:41.215
they've been hiding all along.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.478
What you've seen
on your screens

00:43.521 --> 00:46.481
over the last 48 hours
demands answers

00:46.524 --> 00:47.917
and has led many of us

00:47.960 --> 00:49.527
to ask the question:

00:49.571 --> 00:52.617
Are any of us truly safe?

00:52.661 --> 00:55.446
Do you remember where you were,
what you were doing,

00:55.490 --> 00:57.492
when you first saw
the revelation

00:57.535 --> 00:59.407
of their destructive powers?

00:59.450 --> 01:03.150
[rewinding]

01:03.193 --> 01:05.630
And we are back.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.589
Live from the Bois Blanc Hotel.

01:07.632 --> 01:10.505
I'm gonna circle back
on our friend Bruno. [sighs]

01:10.548 --> 01:12.159
Make sure he hasn't
gone full pyro.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.899
All right, bet.
But from what he said.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.118
he didn't want to go along
with the government's plan

01:15.162 --> 01:16.511
to make the 4,400look bad

01:16.554 --> 01:18.121
any more than we
wanted it to happen.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.167
Okay, and I believe that,
but I don't know what kind of

01:20.210 --> 01:22.560
accidental damages might occur
when someone can shoot fire

01:22.604 --> 01:25.302
from their hands, so...

01:31.352 --> 01:33.093
What the hell?

01:37.836 --> 01:39.751
[glass shatters in distance]

01:39.795 --> 01:41.362
GUARDS [over radio]:
All hands on deck.
All hands on deck.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.581
Let's go, let's go.
Move, move.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.105
Hey!

01:45.148 --> 01:46.628
What happened?

01:46.671 --> 01:48.847
There was an incident
in the courtyard.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.111
[indistinct shouting]

01:52.242 --> 01:54.723
[rewinding]

01:54.766 --> 01:57.117
And we are back.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.770
Live from the Bois Blanc Hotel.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.990
I am happy to introduce you

02:01.033 --> 02:03.514
to the first truly blended 4,400

02:03.558 --> 02:05.429
and 2021 family.

02:05.473 --> 02:08.302
We have husband and wife,
Logan Kaminski

02:08.345 --> 02:09.825
and Bridget Templeton,

02:09.868 --> 02:11.392
their beautiful daughter Mariah,

02:11.435 --> 02:14.264
and Hayden Turner, the 4,400

02:14.308 --> 02:15.918
they have welcomed
into their home.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.137
Hi, everybody.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.660
Hi.
Hi.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.314
LOGAN [over tablet]:
Thanks, Gladys. We're just so

02:20.357 --> 02:21.924
happy to have been able
to invite Hayden

02:21.967 --> 02:23.186
into our home.
Hey, Jess.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.883
What you watching?

02:24.927 --> 02:26.233
Dana.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.756
Hi. Um...

02:27.799 --> 02:29.497
Look, about the
other night, I...

02:29.540 --> 02:32.195
I... didn't mean to-- I mean,

02:32.239 --> 02:34.197
I-I just got out of kind of
a pretty serious relationship,

02:34.241 --> 02:35.372
so I-I shouldn't have...

02:35.416 --> 02:36.417
No sweat, Tanner.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.722
I needed to blow off

02:37.766 --> 02:39.376
some steam, too.Hot chocolate,

02:39.420 --> 02:41.291
shot of espresso.Thank you.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.382
[cell phone buzzing]

02:45.426 --> 02:47.950
Uh, you know, having Hayden
in our home...

02:47.993 --> 02:49.952
BILL [over phone]: Agent Tanner.Hi, Bill.

02:49.995 --> 02:52.563
Patient 32 is confirmed
and standing by at location.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.261
Everything looks like
it's going well...

02:54.304 --> 02:55.392
BILL:
Well, it's not.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.002
Our fire starter
is somehow AWOL.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.265
We have people trying
to look for him, but...

02:58.308 --> 02:59.962
Wait, what do you mean
he's AWOL?

03:00.005 --> 03:00.963
What're we supposed to do?How could you lose him?

03:01.006 --> 03:02.356
MILDRED:
We have names.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.357
Bill?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.402
Who is that? Is...

03:05.446 --> 03:07.230
What's going on?
Is that Patient 48?

03:07.274 --> 03:09.276
[cell phone beeps off]

03:10.538 --> 03:12.192
MARIAH [over tablet]:
Oh, that's not-not me.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.236
Another 4,400.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.064
[laughs]

03:15.107 --> 03:17.197
[sighs] She's, like, so awesome.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.505
[glass shatters]

03:21.549 --> 03:23.072
Oh, my God.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.815
[rewinding]

03:26.858 --> 03:30.122
And we are back. Live from the

03:30.166 --> 03:31.863
Bois Blanc Hotel. I'm happy

03:31.907 --> 03:33.387
to introduce you...

03:33.430 --> 03:34.997
KEN: How can they give
these freaks airtime?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.738
GLADYS:
4,400...

03:39.306 --> 03:40.524
[laughing]

03:44.180 --> 03:45.964
Yo, Steve.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.837
Hilarious, right?
Come on.
[sighs]

03:48.880 --> 03:51.318
Dude, they're...
they're not that bad.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.322
How about this one?

03:55.365 --> 03:56.714
[glass shatters]

03:56.758 --> 03:58.803
Whoa. The hell was that?

03:58.847 --> 03:59.848
GUARD [over radio]: All hands
on deck. All hands on deck.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.458
Courtyard compromised.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.764
Cover this corridor
and wait for further orders.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.331
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Move, move.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.984
GUARD:
Officer needs assistance.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.899
Bill Greene was thrown
from a third-story window.

04:07.943 --> 04:08.987
She tried to kill him.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.033
Stop. [panting]

04:11.076 --> 04:13.644
[indistinct radio transmission]

04:13.688 --> 04:15.124
Brother, calm now.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.648
We need to pray
for Bill.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.824
GUARD [over radio]:
Courtyard, courtyard.

04:21.130 --> 04:24.176
[rewinding]

04:24.220 --> 04:26.266
GLADYS [over video]:
And we are back.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.745
AAMIRA [over video call]:
And Neela's got the twins, too.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.573
She's an ER doctor now.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.358
Beti.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.968
I'm tired of being the only

04:33.011 --> 04:34.796
boomer at Jummah
with a single daughter.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.188
They're asking questions.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.365
"Oh, Aamira, when is Soraya

04:38.408 --> 04:40.802
bringing home
one of those Goris?"

04:43.239 --> 04:45.285
You know what? It doesn't
matter, Mom. All good.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.547
AAMIRA: It does matter.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.896
You work too much as it is.Okay.

04:47.939 --> 04:48.940
You owe them nothing.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.333
Not those 4,400s

04:50.377 --> 04:51.856
or those other people
you work for.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.032
You've been in service
how many years?

04:54.076 --> 04:55.860
And they detain you

04:55.904 --> 04:58.559
like some terrorist,
when we know

04:58.602 --> 05:00.430
for a fact the real terrorists
in this country

05:00.474 --> 05:01.823
are the ones who look like them.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.128
Ma. Oh, my God.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.957
Seriously? You're gonna
get me in trouble.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.308
And I'm proud of your work. I
see this whole event on the TV,

05:08.351 --> 05:10.832
this nice family, it all looks
very big and important,

05:10.875 --> 05:12.703
but I want you to stay safe.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.314
I only care about you.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.576
Okay, Ma.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.708
[glass shatters on video]Oh, Soraya!

05:17.752 --> 05:19.797
[all gasping]

05:20.885 --> 05:23.323
Up. Up in the window.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.802
[overlapping shouting]

05:24.846 --> 05:27.239
What the actual hell?You kept me a prisoner...

05:27.283 --> 05:28.893
GLADYS:
It's clear that the 4,400

05:28.937 --> 05:30.939
have been hiding their
true nature from the world.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.462
What could they want from us?

05:32.506 --> 05:35.509
And what kind of threat
do they pose?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.424
Right now,
officials cannot explain

05:37.467 --> 05:39.556
what is happening
in these frightening images,

05:39.600 --> 05:41.906
and so we must remember
how things were.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.256
Because after this
monumental revelation,

05:44.300 --> 05:46.737
nothing will ever
be the same again.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.173
MILDRED [on tablet]:
You kept me a prisoner

05:48.217 --> 05:49.392
for no reason...

05:49.436 --> 05:51.481
[overlapping shouting]

05:54.571 --> 05:56.225
[panting]

06:06.148 --> 06:07.976
Federal and local governments

06:08.019 --> 06:10.413
have set up a tip line
for the public to call,

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
asking for your help
to report

06:12.459 --> 06:14.112
any suspicious activity.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.680
We're joined now live
from D.C. by Justin François

06:16.724 --> 06:18.116
with the latest
on these events...

06:18.160 --> 06:19.596
[TV clicks off]

06:19.640 --> 06:21.816
Which is why we will now
be triggering

06:21.859 --> 06:23.861
the conservatorships
we already have in place.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.167
What about our safety?How is that gonna help?

06:25.210 --> 06:26.603
How can you even enforce that?

06:26.647 --> 06:28.997
Obviously, a number
of the 4,400 are already

06:29.040 --> 06:31.391
integrated to the general
public, out on their own,

06:31.434 --> 06:32.827
but the government
knows where they are,

06:32.870 --> 06:35.046
and the tip line allows
for any citizen to call in

06:35.090 --> 06:37.440
if they have any suspicious
activity relating to them.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.963
Why not just
round them up?

06:39.007 --> 06:40.574
Because, legally speaking,

06:40.617 --> 06:42.663
we do not have justification
to detain them, yet.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.708
However, those 4,400

06:44.752 --> 06:46.275
who have signed our contracts

06:46.318 --> 06:47.450
will now be placed
under our conservatorship,

06:47.494 --> 06:49.626
for everyone's safety.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.586
Until we know more, they will be
held at the hotel with no

06:52.629 --> 06:55.066
outside contact.
That means no more phones,

06:55.110 --> 06:56.720
or access to the Internet.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.679
They'll be subjected
to a new regimen

06:58.722 --> 07:00.724
of medical care and testing,

07:00.768 --> 07:02.465
and all information obtained
will be the property

07:02.509 --> 07:03.901
of the federal government.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.816
They will be sequestered
in the Bois Blanc,

07:05.860 --> 07:07.078
until further notice,

07:07.122 --> 07:08.906
subject to questioning,

07:08.950 --> 07:11.039
and their movement within
this facility will be monitored.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.475
Guards are authorized
to use force

07:12.519 --> 07:14.216
if necessary.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.784
Are you okay?

07:19.569 --> 07:21.266
I'm so sorry.
The conservatorships

07:21.310 --> 07:23.181
give them the
legal right. I...

07:24.574 --> 07:26.141
I don't know what we can do.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.491
So, we're back
to being prisoners.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.406
Some of us more than others.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.203
Okay, this is
beyond messed up.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.466
A tip line only
encourages people

07:46.509 --> 07:48.163
to further demonize
the 4,400,

07:48.206 --> 07:49.860
and you saw firsthand
at the bar with Claudette

07:49.904 --> 07:51.514
how bad it was
before the world knew.

07:51.558 --> 07:55.083
True, but we all saw
Mildred's little demonstration.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.258
Honestly, I'm surprised
the government

07:56.301 --> 07:57.520
isn't responding
more severely.

07:57.564 --> 07:58.869
Yeah, because that's

07:58.913 --> 08:00.480
exactly what they planned
for it to be.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.482
Look, Mildred only did
what Bruno was supposed to do,

08:02.525 --> 08:04.266
reveal their powers
to the world,

08:04.309 --> 08:06.398
and your girlfriend already knew
about those powers, remember?

08:06.442 --> 08:08.618
Ex. Ex-girlfriend.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.533
Yeah, whatever.Mildred is dangerous.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.101
It doesn't take a bunch
of 4,400 with powers

08:13.144 --> 08:14.711
to do some real damage.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.278
It just takes one.
The government has to protect

08:16.321 --> 08:17.932
the public.
Oh, come on.

08:17.975 --> 08:19.716
Anybody can be dangerous,

08:19.760 --> 08:22.502
but giving paranoid people
a reason to profile the 4,400,

08:22.545 --> 08:25.200
using this conservatorship BS

08:25.243 --> 08:26.549
to take their rights away,
this is how

08:26.593 --> 08:27.985
a police state works,
and you know it.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.683
You're oversimplifying
the situation.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.119
I'm not.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.774
Things are getting bad,
which is why I wanted

08:33.817 --> 08:35.515
to show you this.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.257
Yeah, I remember.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.650
You and your brother
doodle a clock.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.565
You take turns
putting in numbers.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.307
Yes. Look, Manny is here,

08:45.350 --> 08:47.265
doing this somehow,
playing the game again.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.745
I put this two up weeks ago.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.531
And that six just
showed up, but...

08:51.574 --> 08:53.010
It should be a three.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.534
So, it's wrong?

08:54.577 --> 08:56.536
Jharrel, what does
this have to do with...

08:56.579 --> 08:59.147
Yes, it's wrong, but I think

08:59.190 --> 09:01.323
that's because Manny's trying
to tell me something.

09:01.366 --> 09:02.977
[scoffs]

09:03.020 --> 09:05.545
Jharrel, anyone
could've done this.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.852
A bored employee.
A 4,400 with a power or a pen.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.941
Or my brother,

09:10.985 --> 09:13.640
who might be involved
with all of this somehow.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.598
The timing alone...
I mean,

09:15.642 --> 09:18.558
this showed up right before
everything went down.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.821
Look, you didn't know him,
all right,

09:20.864 --> 09:23.258
but Manny was...
he was brilliant.

09:23.301 --> 09:27.131
He saw the world differently.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.612
I think that Manny's
trying to reach me.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.574
[sighs]

09:34.617 --> 09:37.577
Ji-Eun,

09:37.620 --> 09:39.622
it's gonna be all right.[sniffles]

09:39.666 --> 09:41.798
You're not the one
who's wearing these clothes.

09:41.842 --> 09:44.453
You didn't sign
the contract.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.586
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.413
I can't be held
prisoner again.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.025
After everything
we've already lost...SHANICE: Are you okay?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.510
I just want to go back.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.687
To my family,
to my friends,

10:00.730 --> 10:02.166
to Harold.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.603
I thought it could be
okay, but this...

10:03.646 --> 10:05.474
I miss my family, too.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.910
My old life.

10:09.826 --> 10:12.612
I just got
a Jack Russell Terrier. Haneul.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.662
[chuckles]

10:19.706 --> 10:20.881
He was super sweet.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.448
I bet he was a handful...
[chuckles]

10:23.492 --> 10:25.320
...but I bet you took
great care of him.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.367
This is all
so overwhelming,

10:29.411 --> 10:32.719
but it doesn't have to
overrun us.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.678
Think of Haneul next time.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.899
Okay?Okay.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.292
Thank you, Shanice.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.428
I hate them for
doing this to us.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.433
You holding up
all right?

10:51.476 --> 10:54.654
Thank you for helping her.

10:54.697 --> 10:55.916
I just...

10:55.959 --> 10:58.745
I've never not known
what to say.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.660
I should be able
to lead these people.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.488
It's my fault
that this has happened.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.015
Why didn't you sign
one of those contracts?

11:09.886 --> 11:13.107
To be honest, I was more focused
on the task at hand.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.544
I was working
in tandem with Bill,

11:15.587 --> 11:17.677
keeping people safe, protected.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.027
I never thought that...

11:20.070 --> 11:22.551
[sighs] If only I'd
got to him before Mildred.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.988
Still, you saved his life
by stopping her.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.426
The only thing that matters
is moving forward.

11:28.470 --> 11:32.213
We have to figure out
how to fix this.

11:35.216 --> 11:38.001
[knock on door]

11:38.045 --> 11:40.917
Come in.
Since when do they knock?

11:43.659 --> 11:45.139
[door closes]

11:45.182 --> 11:46.706
Uh, hi.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.143
Word on the street
was you wanted to see me?

11:49.186 --> 11:50.753
You must be Soraya?

11:50.797 --> 11:52.233
The very one.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.061
Hmm.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.367
What's up? [chuckles]

11:58.021 --> 12:00.415
LaDonna said you helped her
build this computer,

12:00.458 --> 12:01.982
and that if I ever
needed anything,

12:02.025 --> 12:03.635
I could reach out
to you,

12:03.679 --> 12:05.507
and I haven't heard from her
for a few days now,

12:05.550 --> 12:07.117
and...Uh, same, actually.

12:07.161 --> 12:10.033
Hm. Seems we've both
been ghosts.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.994
Oh. Uh, "ghosted."

12:14.037 --> 12:15.386
"Ghosted."

12:15.430 --> 12:17.780
Hmm. But this can't wait.

12:17.824 --> 12:21.784
I must know if anything we found
at Ypsi Med helps us understand

12:21.828 --> 12:23.481
what the government
wants from us.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.670
I live in fear of the guards
finding this.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.896
I'm at an impasse.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.550
I can see the files,

12:48.593 --> 12:49.856
but there are
so many of them,

12:49.899 --> 12:51.205
and I don't know
what I'm looking for.

12:51.248 --> 12:54.338
And I managed to
finally type in

12:54.382 --> 12:58.821
all of Manny's COBOL code,
but what to do next...

13:03.260 --> 13:05.262
Uh, I am so sorry.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.264
Uh, but...

13:07.308 --> 13:11.094
you, LaDonna, Mildred,

13:11.138 --> 13:13.140
you can all...

13:13.183 --> 13:16.404
You know what,
it's not important.

13:16.447 --> 13:19.015
You want to know
if we all have powers,

13:19.059 --> 13:20.930
and what they are.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.803
It doesn't matter.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.848
I know firsthand
what that feels like,

13:25.892 --> 13:27.894
being asked
endless questions.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.026
I'm sorry.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.854
I was being rude.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.031
Just know that I am
no danger to you.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.468
You can trust me. Trust us.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.039
You understand
what that says?

13:43.083 --> 13:45.607
Uh, some parts, yeah.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.739
Basically, it was written
to analyze and compartmentalize

13:47.783 --> 13:49.480
large data sets.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.874
Like the patient files
we got from Ypsi Med?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.049
Exactly.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.442
Ah.
Mm.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.966
But we've got to run it
through a compiler,

13:57.010 --> 14:00.883
which I think our girl LaDonna

14:00.927 --> 14:02.493
forgot to install.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.755
And you could do that?

14:03.799 --> 14:05.235
Yeah. I can download
a compiler

14:05.279 --> 14:07.281
and do a quick install.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.458
I'll come find you when we're
ready to run this sucker.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.288
Run?

14:14.331 --> 14:17.030
Where will we be running?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.947
Yo, you wanted
to see me?

14:20.990 --> 14:23.950
Uh, yes.
Thank you for coming.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.126
I just wanted to
let you know that

14:26.169 --> 14:29.085
you are fired.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.609
Effective immediately.
Thank you for your service.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.918
Wow. So it's like that?

14:35.962 --> 14:39.095
You know, I figured things
might be changing around here

14:39.139 --> 14:41.968
for all of us,
but nope, just me, huh?

14:42.011 --> 14:44.666
You have been a pain in my ass

14:44.709 --> 14:46.711
from the minute
you entered this facility.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.278
You've broken numerous rules.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.541
You assisted in the attempted
escape of 32...

14:50.585 --> 14:52.065
You mean Bruno Comtois?

14:52.108 --> 14:54.197
They have names, Jessica.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.896
So will you be needing
a police escort or...

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
You really want to
play this game?

14:58.549 --> 15:01.683
See, because I know what
y'all are up to at Ypsi Med.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.380
So you can fire me
all you want,

15:03.424 --> 15:05.992
but what is to keep me
from telling the truth?

15:06.035 --> 15:07.341
Huh? From going to the press?

15:07.384 --> 15:08.951
Call Gladys Keller
for all I care.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.954
You would actually be
doing me a favor.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.564
After Mildred's little display,

15:13.608 --> 15:15.349
the public is just waiting
for confirmation

15:15.392 --> 15:17.133
that all the 4,400
have powers.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.135
And when they get that,
they'll be begging for us

15:19.179 --> 15:20.528
to protect them.

15:20.571 --> 15:24.271
We shine when we serve
and protect. Remember?

15:27.143 --> 15:28.318
You're gonna regret being
on this side

15:28.362 --> 15:29.885
of history, Jessica.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.151
[door opens, slams]

15:46.249 --> 15:49.339
I have an idea.Please.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.559
Well, it's really an idea
we already had.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.953
Your sermon a few weeks ago?

15:53.996 --> 15:55.780
Our call for sanctuary.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.391
We need to finish
what we started.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.697
We need to make this hotel
a religious sanctuary

15:59.741 --> 16:03.266
for all of the 4,400,
and for real this time.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.790
No more government deals.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.010
Believe me, lesson learned.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.751
When sanctuary is granted,

16:09.794 --> 16:12.101
it would nullify
these conservatorships.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.363
The government wouldn't
even be able to

16:13.407 --> 16:15.017
step foot in here.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.497
And I already finished
a lot of the paperwork

16:16.540 --> 16:20.022
before you struck your deal
with Bill Greene.

16:20.066 --> 16:24.070
But creating a church here,
it was predicated

16:24.113 --> 16:27.029
on my being their
leader, right?

16:27.073 --> 16:28.596
And I just don't know.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.859
Ever since...
Mildred.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.557
Right?

16:34.906 --> 16:37.083
You were up there with her.

16:37.126 --> 16:41.783
You've seemed... off ever since.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.701
Did something happen
when you were with her?

16:51.358 --> 16:53.012
I pulled her away
from the window

16:53.055 --> 16:54.796
to try to stop
her, and...

16:54.839 --> 16:58.452
when I let go,
her powers were gone.

16:58.495 --> 17:01.542
[chuckles]
What do you mean, "gone"?

17:01.585 --> 17:03.239
She tried to use
her powers on me,

17:03.283 --> 17:05.024
but she couldn't.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.373
She couldn't.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.679
And as I've
thought about it,

17:08.723 --> 17:12.901
I've come to realize that
perhaps this is my power.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.772
To negate the powers
of others and...

17:14.816 --> 17:16.818
You can take away powers?

17:16.861 --> 17:18.820
It can't be!

17:18.863 --> 17:21.649
I champion that
which makes us special.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.781
Our powers, our abilities.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.653
What does it mean
if I can take it all away?

17:25.696 --> 17:29.265
What kind of leader
can I be for them?

17:30.962 --> 17:33.226
I can't.

17:42.278 --> 17:45.847
♪ I kind of find it strange...

17:45.890 --> 17:48.328
Here is to lasting
as long as I did.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.069
Mm
.
'Cause Lord knows

17:50.112 --> 17:52.114
she wanted me gone
since day one.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.162
Yeah, I did have to save
your ass a few times.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.339
Yeah, well,
now she dumped us both.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.080
No, something changed.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.082
Okay? She's not the same as
she was when this all started.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.172
Or she is, and you are
just seeing things

18:06.215 --> 18:07.303
more clearly now.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.000
Hmm. You mean your way.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.090
Well, my way does collect
unemployment now, so...

18:11.133 --> 18:13.353
Hey, at least
I'm still there, huh?

18:13.396 --> 18:17.096
Run interference between
Jessica and the 4,400.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.272
You think you can keep
your girl in check?
Mm.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.882
How many times
do I have to tell you

18:20.925 --> 18:22.362
she is not my girl, Jharrel?

18:22.405 --> 18:24.146
You sure about that?

18:24.190 --> 18:26.714
'Cause I caught her looking
at you this morning during

18:26.757 --> 18:29.195
what turned out to be
my farewell briefing.

18:30.544 --> 18:33.024
[exhales sharply]

18:33.068 --> 18:37.116
Anyway, now that I am banned
from the Bois Blanc,

18:37.159 --> 18:39.553
do you think you can, like,
I don't know,

18:39.596 --> 18:42.033
at least keep an eye
on the clock for me?

18:42.077 --> 18:45.689
You know, take photos, uh,
text me if anything new appears.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.517
Jharrel, if he was trying
to talk to you,

18:47.561 --> 18:51.565
why not just go, like,
"Bloop, here I am, bro.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.393
And-and here's
your urgent message."

18:53.436 --> 18:54.785
I don't know.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.571
Okay? Maybe he's in
danger or something,

18:57.614 --> 18:58.746
and that's why
he hasn't appeared.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.574
But that mark showed up

19:00.617 --> 19:02.184
right when everything
went to hell.

19:02.228 --> 19:05.361
Look, I can't believe that
that means nothing.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.581
You have a better explanation
for any of the stuff

19:07.624 --> 19:08.843
that's been going on
these days?

19:12.847 --> 19:14.370
All right, fine.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.807
I'll keep an eye
on your damn wall.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.158
Thanks, partner.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.465
Mm!

19:22.509 --> 19:26.121
And this next round is
going on my Chime card.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.430
BARTENDER:
Hey. What can I get you?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.869
Ahh.

19:34.912 --> 19:38.568
It feels like a distant
memory, the fresh air.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.788
Glad to see no one has
discovered our tunnel

19:40.831 --> 19:42.355
into the free world.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.661
Yeah, you're right, but
I hope no one sees us.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.795
That tip line
has me spooked.

19:47.838 --> 19:51.451
Since Mildred's display,
it's as if the whole world

19:51.494 --> 19:54.976
is just waiting for one of us
to spontaneously combust.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.413
Hmm. Well, our powers,

19:57.457 --> 19:59.633
it is all a lot
to take in.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.113
And especially difficult
given our lack of privacy.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.815
I was with Rev earlier
when he confided in me

20:07.858 --> 20:09.295
that he thinks when
he grabbed Mildred

20:09.338 --> 20:10.296
up in that office,

20:10.339 --> 20:12.211
he took away her powers.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.866
What does this mean?

20:15.910 --> 20:19.087
That with the slightest touch
he can absorb

20:19.130 --> 20:21.307
or relieve us of our powers?I don't know.

20:21.350 --> 20:24.919
But it is something
he's processing right now.

20:24.962 --> 20:28.401
And I know you, Andre.
Give him some time

20:28.444 --> 20:32.013
before you go all
scientific method on him.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.929
Well, to be honest, I have
other pressing concerns.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.801
And, I'm happy to report,
we have a new ally.

20:37.845 --> 20:38.846
What?
Mm-hmm.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.282
Who?

20:40.326 --> 20:43.677
There's a woman,
a tech-spert named Soraya,

20:43.720 --> 20:45.679
who's helping us
look into these files.

20:45.722 --> 20:49.073
If we can make sense
of all of this...

20:49.117 --> 20:52.120
then maybe we can find
a way forward.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.523
STEVE:
Hey.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.567
We gotta go.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.613
What are you doing? [grunts]

21:06.656 --> 21:07.788
ANDRE:
Oh, no.

21:07.831 --> 21:08.963
No, Andre.
People may see.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.573
He needs help, Shanice.

21:10.617 --> 21:13.576
God! Holy mothballs, this hurts!JOGGER: You okay?

21:13.620 --> 21:16.275
Steve, let me just...

21:19.103 --> 21:20.627
[Andre exhales]

21:23.456 --> 21:26.459
What the...Andre, let's go now.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.115
Whoa.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.469
SHANICE:
This is exactly what
I was afraid of.

21:36.512 --> 21:39.123
That person near us was
for sure calling that tip line.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.735
What if they come
for us, Andre?

21:41.778 --> 21:43.737
Take you to Ypsi Med?

21:43.780 --> 21:45.304
I couldn't leave Steve
in pain like that.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.653
[scoffs]

21:46.696 --> 21:47.784
When you take an oath
to help people,

21:47.828 --> 21:49.308
you can't choose your patients.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.614
We aren't on the front lines
of a war, Andre.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.224
Nor are you practicing
in a hospital.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.705
You do have a choice
in who you heal right now,

21:55.749 --> 21:58.317
because it impacts more
than just yourself.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.975
[sighs sharply]

22:05.019 --> 22:08.457
Ever since we came here
and got these powers,

22:08.501 --> 22:12.156
it has only caused pain,
suffering.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.115
Made our lives more difficult.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.466
We have been othered in
so many different ways, Andre.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.208
And now this?They also help.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.776
[scoffs]I can heal.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.386
Your power has aided me
in the past.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.345
But to what end?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.825
You heal somebody,
but that makes you sick.

22:28.869 --> 22:32.742
You're only gonna get sicker
unless you find some way

22:32.786 --> 22:34.918
to release whatever is inside.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.138
True.

22:37.181 --> 22:39.140
But I doubt Claudette
would be up for

22:39.183 --> 22:42.143
a damaged knee, even if
she were in town. [chuckles]

22:42.186 --> 22:43.362
[groans softly]

22:43.405 --> 22:44.406
Andre, this isn't a joke.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.756
[rat squeaking nearby]

22:48.236 --> 22:51.544
Shanice, fair warning.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.720
[whispering]:
There's a rat behind you.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.069
[loudly]:
What?!

22:55.112 --> 22:56.897
Perhaps a solution.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.942
Andre![rat stops squeaking]

22:58.986 --> 23:00.683
Ah.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.730
Oh. It worked.

23:06.907 --> 23:07.951
Huh.

23:16.003 --> 23:19.572
♪ Ride on the rays
of the farthest sun ♪

23:20.529 --> 23:22.792
♪ Oh, fly on...

23:22.836 --> 23:26.405
Damn. Nothing from Jess?

23:26.448 --> 23:28.407
I guess I gotta get used to her,
what, not texting me back?

23:28.450 --> 23:31.975
You know what,
I know that I have been

23:32.019 --> 23:33.499
hard on you about it,

23:33.542 --> 23:35.239
but I really am sorry
that you two broke up.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.327
Are you?

23:36.371 --> 23:38.199
Are you? [laughs]

23:38.242 --> 23:39.766
Hey, girl.

23:39.809 --> 23:43.465
Soraya. Hello.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.467
SORAYA:
So I missed,

23:45.511 --> 23:47.600
uh, raising a glass
to your untimely demise.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.037
Hey, you got it worse than me.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.473
They made you keep your job.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.520
Okay.[laughter]

23:54.563 --> 23:56.347
Is it weird for you that
Jessica canned your partner?

23:56.391 --> 23:59.525
Uh, we just killed a bottle
trying to figure that out.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.440
But, uh, the answer is no.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.876
I mean, it's unacceptable.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.573
She needs to be called out
for her behavior.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.532
Okay. Attagirl.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.447
See, J, you still got
a partner.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.623
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.625
That wasn't here before.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.150
Manny was here.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.326
Huh.
He did this.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.849
It's like the one you
showed me in the hotel,

24:19.893 --> 24:21.982
but there's a one, two,
six, nine.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.984
Oh, God, don't encourage him.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.551
Come on, Keisha.

24:25.594 --> 24:27.074
Like he knew
that I got fired.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.815
That is why
he left the clue here.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.338
Why wouldn't he
just reveal himself?

24:30.381 --> 24:31.992
Why-why go through
these hoops?Preach.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.820
Something must be wrong.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.952
I don't know, maybe
he's in trouble or...

24:35.996 --> 24:37.084
Maybe it's just
the Quantico speaking,

24:37.127 --> 24:38.868
but if it is Manny--

24:38.912 --> 24:41.088
and I'm not saying it is--

24:41.131 --> 24:42.742
maybe he's trying
to get a message across.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.396
Like, maybe those numbers
correspond to letters.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.702
Maybe it's a cypher.

24:46.746 --> 24:47.790
You need to figure out
what the key is.

24:47.834 --> 24:48.791
Something you would both know.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.924
A cypher.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.274
I mean, it'd be
more Manny's thing.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.667
I-I wouldn't even know
where to start.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.495
Well, maybe he's putting
his faith in you

24:56.538 --> 24:59.280
to know him a little better
than you think you do.

24:59.323 --> 25:02.109
Okay, um...

25:02.152 --> 25:03.937
Oh, we would leave
clocks in books

25:03.980 --> 25:05.199
that we would read together.

25:05.242 --> 25:08.028
Maybe there's something
on page 1,269.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.509
I mean, I don't know
if we read anything that long,

25:10.552 --> 25:12.511
but thank you.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.253
Hmm.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.994
Want to stay?

25:18.038 --> 25:19.169
Round on me.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.606
[sighs]

25:20.649 --> 25:22.564
I should go home.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.914
I already know I got
a long day tomorrow.

25:37.274 --> 25:40.408
Ah, no more patellar
disturbances I hope.

25:40.451 --> 25:42.453
Don't come near me.
Keep your distance.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.804
Steve, what's wrong?
Does your knee...Because of your little stunt,

25:44.847 --> 25:47.633
some park rando thought
I was one of you. A 4,400.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.243
Not only did she call
the tip line,

25:49.286 --> 25:51.419
she put my picture online,
and I got doxxed.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.726
Okay? And now I have people

25:53.769 --> 25:55.989
harassing my family's
storefront again.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.339
You're not gonna be
another reason

25:58.382 --> 25:59.601
me and my family have
targets on our backs.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.299
But you were in
so much distress,

26:02.343 --> 26:04.084
and I know Miss LaDonna
would have wanted me

26:04.127 --> 26:06.216
looking after...Don't even talk about LaDonna!

26:07.391 --> 26:09.263
Stay away from me.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.354
SHANICE:
You are aware that

26:13.397 --> 26:15.312
these conservatorships
don't apply to us?

26:15.356 --> 26:16.966
REV: We're not prisoners,
and you can't keep us...

26:17.010 --> 26:19.142
Did you two try to exit the
premises despite it being

26:19.186 --> 26:21.318
very clear we need to keep you
here for your own safety?

26:21.362 --> 26:23.407
We would like to cross
the street to mail something.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.235
We have every right to leave.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.194
Any unlawful detainment...Like I said,

26:27.237 --> 26:29.675
it's not detainment,
it's public safety.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.024
I'll take whatever it is.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.503
Oh, no, ma'am.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.201
We're not gonna rely
on you for anything.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.769
I've tried that.
Look where it got us.

26:36.812 --> 26:40.511
In fact, we are filing papers
to make this space a sanctuary.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.426
This time, you're not
gonna stop us.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.385
Well, I hate
to burst your bubble,

26:44.428 --> 26:46.256
but you'll need
refugee status,

26:46.300 --> 26:47.910
which is granted
by my department,

26:47.954 --> 26:50.304
DHS, in order to be
given sanctuary

26:50.347 --> 26:51.479
anywhere in the city of Detroit,

26:51.522 --> 26:53.046
or anywhere else,
for that matter.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.656
And we have filed
a comprehensive,

26:54.700 --> 26:57.354
legally sound motion
to be granted such status

26:57.398 --> 26:59.530
as refugees out of time.

26:59.574 --> 27:02.446
That is very clever.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.362
But there's a lot of red tape

27:05.406 --> 27:06.842
with this kind of thing,
and we kind of have

27:06.886 --> 27:08.627
our hands full,
as you might have noticed.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.063
So it doesn't really matter

27:10.106 --> 27:11.673
if you make it to the mailbox
or not.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.763
Your whole gambit is pointless.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.773
[door opens]

27:26.819 --> 27:29.169
Keisha.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.301
Hi.

27:31.345 --> 27:34.348
What are you...You fired Jharrel?

27:38.308 --> 27:40.441
Your friend Jharrel has been
a pain in my ass

27:40.484 --> 27:43.183
since day one,
undermining my authority.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.881
I can't have that kind of
insubordination on my watch.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.014
Men think they
rule the world.

27:48.057 --> 27:50.364
He's a good social worker.
He actually cares...

27:50.407 --> 27:51.931
And you seem to care more
about me letting him go

27:51.974 --> 27:54.847
than about our breakup.

27:57.153 --> 27:58.198
I miss you.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.464
How can you say that?

28:05.292 --> 28:07.686
When you're keeping these
people detained in this hotel?

28:07.729 --> 28:09.252
You want to talk
about your feelings?

28:09.296 --> 28:10.732
You're treating them
like animals.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.386
I'm treating them
like the threat they are.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.257
Explain to me why

28:14.301 --> 28:16.172
all of their blood panels came
back with matching anomalies?

28:16.216 --> 28:19.698
I've seen firsthand the "people"
that we have at Ypsi Med,

28:19.741 --> 28:22.701
like a man who can shoot fire,
who we thankfully contained,

28:22.744 --> 28:24.790
or Mildred, for that matter,
who is still at large.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.792
[pills rattling]We've already gotten

28:26.835 --> 28:28.794
over 200 phone calls
off the tip line.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.406
Well, why now?

28:32.449 --> 28:34.756
You've already known about
their powers, about Ypsi Med.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.192
Due to Gladys Keller's
broadcast,

28:36.236 --> 28:37.716
we finally have the public
on our side.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.805
A public that wants to know
that we are managing

28:39.848 --> 28:41.632
a potential danger
to society.

28:41.676 --> 28:45.027
A public that deserves
to feel safe and protected.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.640
You wanted this to happen.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.774
For people to feel scared.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.516
Come on, Jess,
don't be that person.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.518
I'm who
I've always been.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.172
You're the one
that's changed.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.651
I've grown.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.741
You can, too.
With a stroke of your pen,

29:02.784 --> 29:04.960
you could stop this absurdity,
actually let the 4,400

29:05.004 --> 29:06.832
have a proper
sanctuary here.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.138
Just let them be.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.750
Honestly, I'm surprised
that this is your position.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.360
Your sister
was murdered

29:13.403 --> 29:14.622
because of someone
that shouldn't have been out

29:14.665 --> 29:16.058
and was lethally dangerous.

29:16.102 --> 29:18.495
Don't do that.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.759
You don't bring my sister
into this mess,

29:20.802 --> 29:22.369
like it changes the fact
that what you're doing...

29:22.412 --> 29:24.284
No, Keisha, what we'redoing.

29:27.243 --> 29:30.159
What we're doing...

29:30.203 --> 29:31.465
...is wrong.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.904
I quit.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.051
SORAYA:So, this compiler
is cross-referencing

29:52.094 --> 29:55.271

29:59.449 --> 30:01.408
frees us from suspicions.

30:01.451 --> 30:02.844
Even Steve,

30:02.888 --> 30:04.715
who's usually quite
keen and amiable,

30:04.759 --> 30:06.892
accosted me over...

30:08.545 --> 30:11.810

30:11.853 --> 30:14.073
what's it for?

30:14.116 --> 30:15.422
[sighs]

30:17.641 --> 30:19.382
Well...

30:19.426 --> 30:21.254
mostly, it's to

30:21.297 --> 30:24.387
instill fear,
create a chilling effect.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.955
It weaponizes every person
on the street, with all their

30:26.999 --> 30:29.479
misinformation and prejudices

30:29.523 --> 30:31.830
and... hate.

30:31.873 --> 30:34.310
But Steve?
How could he think...

30:34.354 --> 30:35.964
Anyone is susceptible,
given the right conditions.

30:36.008 --> 30:38.749
We all have to protect
ourselves sometimes,

30:38.793 --> 30:41.448
especially those of us
who stick out.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.931
I'm sure this past year wasn't
easy for Steve and his family.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.976

30:48.020 --> 30:50.239
during COVID,
it was awful,

30:50.283 --> 30:51.980

32:06.837 --> 32:09.405

interests at heart,

32:09.449 --> 32:11.538
but every action,
every decision I've made

32:11.581 --> 32:13.279
has been the wrong one.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.716
And on top of all that,

32:15.759 --> 32:18.458

32:18.501 --> 32:20.808
[sighs] It's of no use.

It's why I came

to take away my power.

You call it my power,

from God, Shanice.

And she didn't know.
I didn't know it would happen.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.024
It-It's invasive.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.330
It's wrong.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.896
But that doesn't
give me the right.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.594
I can't just take it from you.

33:07.637 --> 33:08.987
No, no, Your power isn't about

33:09.030 --> 33:10.597
taking something away,
it's about

33:10.640 --> 33:14.775
providing us with something
we were never given,

33:14.818 --> 33:15.994
a choice.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.435
And I can give you that,

mailed the paperwork

34:18.317 --> 34:20.493

you never know.

that gave the government

34:25.672 --> 34:28.022
