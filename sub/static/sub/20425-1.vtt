I'll have to ask you to put
your seat back for landing.

00:31.851 --> 00:33.818
- Oh, of course.
- And I'm sorry.

00:33.819 --> 00:35.620
I hope it's not a bother.

00:35.621 --> 00:37.488
- What's your name?
- Cindy.

00:43.695 --> 00:44.995
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:00.146 --> 01:03.013
- You ready, Miss Townsen?
- Let's do this.

01:21.734 --> 01:24.202
'Why'd Rainer walk off the set?'

01:24.203 --> 01:26.171
'Was it because of Jake?'

01:34.346 --> 01:35.746
Welcome home, Miss Townsen.

01:37.382 --> 01:38.649
Thanks, Derrick.

02:01.106 --> 02:03.775
'Can I borrow five
bucks from the rent jar?'

02:03.776 --> 02:05.210
- Cassie?
- Please.

02:05.211 --> 02:07.112
I can't bear another PB and J for lunch.

02:07.113 --> 02:09.646
You guys make me the
banker for a reason.

02:09.648 --> 02:11.249
- It's called making rent.
- Fine.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.852
I'll just chew my fingernails.

02:13.853 --> 02:16.287
That's protein right, Jake?

02:16.288 --> 02:18.189
Cheese enchilada.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.625
Nachos with extra jalapenos.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.627
Fine, but if we're doing Mexican

02:22.628 --> 02:24.396
we're springing for extra guac.

02:24.397 --> 02:26.398
Yes.

02:26.399 --> 02:29.434
Okay, and then after lunch, we
can go to Gold Brothers Studios

02:29.435 --> 02:30.876
and audition for the "Locked" movie.

02:30.877 --> 02:32.580
You're seriously going
to that cattle call?

02:32.581 --> 02:33.638
Hell, yes.

02:33.639 --> 02:35.507
"Locked" is the biggest book series

02:35.508 --> 02:36.975
since Harry Potter.

02:36.976 --> 02:39.077
That's exactly why 10,000
girls are auditioning.

02:39.078 --> 02:40.519
And we all have an equal shot at it.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.787
- "We?"
- You're coming with me.

02:41.788 --> 02:43.148
I'm not taking no for an answer.

02:43.149 --> 02:45.717
Cassie! Come on.

02:45.718 --> 02:48.386
My parents would be so
unhappy if they found out

02:48.387 --> 02:50.822
I was spending my time
auditioning for stuff

02:50.823 --> 02:52.357
instead of actually studying.

02:52.358 --> 02:55.293
You do know that every time you
tell your parents you like math

02:55.294 --> 02:57.729
you're giving the
performance of a lifetime.

02:57.730 --> 03:00.131
It's not math. It's econ.

03:00.132 --> 03:01.798
And I don't..

03:03.301 --> 03:05.837
...hate it.

03:05.838 --> 03:07.204
But you don't love it.

03:08.673 --> 03:10.173
Admit it.

03:11.176 --> 03:13.076
You wanna be an actress.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.752
Yeah, okay, I do.

03:20.753 --> 03:24.789
I-I-I want to be an actress,
but... it doesn't matter.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.111
As soon as I tell my parents that

03:26.112 --> 03:27.735
they're just gonna
yank my ass back home.

03:27.736 --> 03:31.663
So then don't tell them and come
to "Locked" audition with me.

03:31.664 --> 03:33.630
Well, Paige, what have you got to lose?

03:39.003 --> 03:40.070
Really?

03:41.339 --> 03:42.874
What are we wearing?

03:42.875 --> 03:44.809
- Oh, my God, okay.
- We're gonna go shopping

03:44.810 --> 03:46.153
and then we'll just hide the tags

03:46.154 --> 03:47.645
and return it all tomorrow.

03:47.646 --> 03:48.746
Okay.

03:56.021 --> 03:57.922
No one knows why the romance between

03:57.923 --> 03:59.557
these two Hollywood mega stars ended

03:59.558 --> 04:01.626
'but there's certainly
been a lot of speculation.'

04:01.627 --> 04:03.228
'And with behavior this erratic'

04:03.229 --> 04:05.363
it's easy to understand
why so many people think

04:05.364 --> 04:06.931
Rainer fell off the wagon.

04:06.932 --> 04:09.033
Jordan's always been
protective of his friend.

04:09.034 --> 04:11.102
'Maybe he was just trying to help.'

04:11.103 --> 04:12.403
You're on TV.

04:12.404 --> 04:15.240
When asked to comment,
Rainer Devon declined.

04:15.241 --> 04:17.875
Or maybe you're too busy
duking it out with your ex-BFF.

04:17.877 --> 04:19.310
'Am I right, buddy?'

04:19.310 --> 04:20.911
Why aren't you commenting?

04:22.380 --> 04:24.182
I don't need to. He knows what he did.

04:24.183 --> 04:26.584
'Maybe Rainer's on a
bender because he's lonely.'

04:26.585 --> 04:28.920
'With girlfriend Tangey
Turner's mega tour selling out'

04:28.921 --> 04:30.622
these two are miles apart.

04:30.623 --> 04:32.606
Do you think you could
get me tickets to her show?

04:32.607 --> 04:35.960
And I wonder what Hollywood
mega producer Nina Devon

04:35.961 --> 04:38.496
feels about the public
feud between her son

04:38.497 --> 04:39.797
and his ex-bestie?

04:39.798 --> 04:41.165
What good is power

04:41.166 --> 04:42.826
if you can't protect the ones you love?

04:45.103 --> 04:47.004
Tune in tomorrow to
get the latest dish..

04:53.177 --> 04:55.647
There's a car waiting outside.

04:55.648 --> 04:57.147
He'll take you home.

04:58.216 --> 04:59.416
Thank you.

05:01.019 --> 05:03.002
Does she need to sign a
confidentiality agreement?

05:03.003 --> 05:04.322
I took care of it last night.

05:04.323 --> 05:05.822
Good.

05:08.526 --> 05:11.395
Find out where Barrett
Hopper does lunch?

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
Nice meeting you.

05:18.202 --> 05:19.202
It was a pleasure.

05:20.338 --> 05:21.338
I'll call you.

05:28.112 --> 05:30.048
I'm your mother, and
I'll take care of Barrett

05:30.049 --> 05:31.716
but with all these rumors flying around

05:31.717 --> 05:33.117
about you starting fights

05:33.118 --> 05:35.653
there's talk that you're un-insurable.

05:35.654 --> 05:38.856
Mom, I'm not drinking again.

05:38.857 --> 05:40.824
I'll pee in a cup. Whatever it takes.

05:42.794 --> 05:44.495
You've got that look, the one you get

05:44.496 --> 05:46.156
when you don't wanna tell me something.

05:47.198 --> 05:49.534
I gave you the lead in "Locked"

05:49.535 --> 05:51.502
because I know you'll deliver.

05:51.503 --> 05:53.705
Okay, you don't need to give
me the executive sandwich.

05:53.706 --> 05:55.306
Just tell me what's going on.

05:55.307 --> 05:57.842
You know how deeply
invested in this movie I am?

05:57.843 --> 05:59.042
It has to be a hit.

06:00.244 --> 06:01.813
I'm ready.

06:01.814 --> 06:03.948
I want this. And I
know that you need it.

06:03.949 --> 06:07.418
I believe you, but...
we're having a hard time

06:07.419 --> 06:09.886
selling it foreign with
just your name on the poster.

06:11.589 --> 06:13.256
I sent the script to Jordan.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.429
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.098
We're after a few people,
and he's just one of them.

06:23.668 --> 06:25.903
Do I have a say in this?

06:25.904 --> 06:28.606
Sure. Either you're in or you're out.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.849
'The studio's casting
the net far and wide'

06:37.850 --> 06:39.684
in their search for the female lead

06:39.685 --> 06:43.087
'in its highly anticipated
film franchise "Locked."'

06:43.088 --> 06:45.189
'The movies starring Rainer Devon'

06:45.190 --> 06:48.159
'are destined to become
a worldwide phenomenon.'

06:48.160 --> 06:51.195
'And every actress in Hollywood
is vying for the part.'

06:51.196 --> 06:53.665
If we scoot over a little, I
think we can get into the shot.

06:53.666 --> 06:55.966
'Uh, let's not worry about that.'

06:57.301 --> 06:59.170
- Oh, my God.
- We're actually doing this.

06:59.171 --> 07:02.240
- Next!
- Hi, I'm Cassandra Perkins.

07:02.241 --> 07:04.104
- And this is my friend...
- Hi, Paige Townsen.

07:04.105 --> 07:07.311
There's no D at the end. Just
an N, not an ND. Just an N.

07:07.312 --> 07:09.480
- Paige, you're babbling.
- Uh, no.

07:09.481 --> 07:11.649
No, I'm not. No. What?
Seriously. Oh, my God.

07:11.650 --> 07:13.151
Why can't I stop talking like this?

07:13.152 --> 07:15.153
- I really want this.
- 'Next!'

07:22.528 --> 07:23.927
I think I might throw up.

07:25.129 --> 07:26.164
Ouch.

07:26.165 --> 07:27.699
You're not nervous anymore, are you?

07:27.700 --> 07:30.435
Uh, no. Now, I'm in pain.

07:30.436 --> 07:32.537
'This is your shot, people. Listen up.'

07:32.538 --> 07:34.505
'Cassandra Perkins, you're next.'

07:44.782 --> 07:47.285
Dude, there's a chance we're
gonna be working together again.

07:47.286 --> 07:48.985
Can we just put Tangey behind us?

07:49.921 --> 07:51.588
You still don't get it.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.191
This isn't about her.

07:54.926 --> 07:57.028
It's about who you are.

07:57.029 --> 07:58.529
Or who you turned out not to be.

07:58.530 --> 08:01.298
- I know how it looks, but...
- But what?

08:04.001 --> 08:05.402
Just get out of my way.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.781
Well?

08:16.782 --> 08:18.416
I'm okay with whatever happens.

08:18.417 --> 08:19.416
Yeah, right.

08:26.091 --> 08:28.292
- Sorry I'm late.
- Well, hello.

08:28.293 --> 08:30.895
Cards on the table, you
know we added Jordan Wilder

08:30.896 --> 08:32.163
to the "Ed" list, right?

08:32.164 --> 08:33.231
Yep.

08:33.232 --> 08:34.832
You hardly have any scenes together.

08:34.832 --> 08:38.803
It's mostly you, alone on a
magical island with August.

08:38.804 --> 08:41.038
You can't buy this kind of hype.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.474
It's a complex role.
I need a real actress.

08:43.475 --> 08:45.777
'Calm down, Wyatt.
It's a publicity stunt.'

08:45.778 --> 08:48.513
'We'll ride the wave, and
then we'll just decide that'

08:48.514 --> 08:50.681
Dakota was right for the role all along.

08:50.682 --> 08:52.215
Or Alexis.

08:53.284 --> 08:55.585
What are you doing?

09:05.696 --> 09:07.665
Thank you, Cassie, for
talking me into this.

09:07.666 --> 09:10.468
This is seriously, like,
the best day of my life.

09:10.469 --> 09:12.270
I knew it. I knew you'd kill it.

09:12.271 --> 09:15.673
I don't know if they believed
me, but I believed me.

09:15.674 --> 09:19.110
I really felt like I
was August in there.

09:19.111 --> 09:21.345
Hey, did you hear that? She killed it.

09:21.346 --> 09:23.581
Yeah, Paige Townsen without the D.

09:23.582 --> 09:25.550
Remember her name and mine too

09:25.551 --> 09:28.052
Cassandra two S's three A's

09:28.053 --> 09:30.188
- Let's go right now.
- Yeah.

09:30.189 --> 09:34.425
Rain, you're still excited
about Dakota, right?

09:34.426 --> 09:35.926
And Alexis.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.196
- They're both great.
- Good.

10:02.921 --> 10:04.954
'Nina, Nina. Over here. Nina, here.'

10:06.156 --> 10:08.558
'Nina, over here. Nina.
Nina, really quick.'

10:15.975 --> 10:19.078
- Tommy. How's the family?
- All good.

10:19.079 --> 10:22.314
Look, I don't have you down, but
I'll get you a table right away.

10:22.315 --> 10:25.484
Thanks, but I'm not here to eat.

10:25.485 --> 10:27.820
'Oh, I miss those days
when that little pisher'

10:27.821 --> 10:30.454
only came in here because
he was picking up your lunch.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.436
My son hasn't had a
drink in over a year.

10:44.437 --> 10:46.638
Then tell him I said cheers.

10:46.639 --> 10:49.041
This negative press has got to stop.

10:49.042 --> 10:52.644
Sure, I'll finish it
...when I decide to.

10:52.645 --> 10:55.414
You were on my desk
for two years, Barrett.

10:55.415 --> 10:56.849
You know how I play.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.593
Do you really wanna
start something with me?

10:58.594 --> 11:01.186
Nina, this isn't personal.

11:01.187 --> 11:02.855
Feldman's making me an offer.

11:02.856 --> 11:05.524
I'm only one filthy secret
away from going global.

11:05.525 --> 11:07.465
And it's your son who's
going to take me there.

11:13.098 --> 11:15.934
You were a whimpering
little twit when I hired you.

11:15.935 --> 11:18.704
- You remember that, right?
- Yes, yes.

11:18.705 --> 11:20.439
Do you also remember that I have friends

11:20.440 --> 11:23.242
who enjoy taking care of my problems?

11:23.243 --> 11:24.842
They don't just squeeze..

11:26.812 --> 11:27.546
...they cut.

11:27.547 --> 11:30.047
Please. Please, let go.

11:31.617 --> 11:34.352
- Stay away from my son.
- Okay.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.491
Because I don't wanna ever
have to grab your balls again.

11:39.492 --> 11:41.025
It's beneath me.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.834
He needs a bag of ice.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.172
Jordan, what happened to you?

11:54.507 --> 11:56.040
You need to back off.

12:49.662 --> 12:53.198
- Is that vintage?
- Yeah, it was my grandma's.

12:53.199 --> 12:54.733
My mom wanted to bury her in it

12:54.734 --> 12:57.102
but it was her favorite so I kept it.

12:57.103 --> 13:00.305
- And you still wear it?
- I'm wearing it for the play.

13:00.306 --> 13:02.341
Jake wanted us to dress period.

13:02.342 --> 13:03.841
He's so smart.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.949
- 'Lacey?'
- Brody. Hi.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.951
Hey.

13:12.952 --> 13:15.053
Oh, this is crazy, I was
just about to call you.

13:15.054 --> 13:18.624
Really? Yeah, that is... that is crazy.

13:18.625 --> 13:21.759
I gotta go help my friend fold laundry.

13:29.101 --> 13:32.037
If you ever wanna bring her, I'm
a more-the-merrier kind of guy.

13:32.038 --> 13:34.673
Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll-I'll ask her.

13:34.674 --> 13:36.574
- See you soon.
- Bye.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.080
Who was that?

13:45.083 --> 13:48.387
I don't know. Some rich
dude from Beverly Hills.

13:48.388 --> 13:50.489
Couldn't find his way home.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.090
Really? It seemed like he knew you.

13:52.091 --> 13:53.491
Nope.

14:04.202 --> 14:05.537
Hello?

14:05.538 --> 14:06.921
'Paige Townsend?'

14:06.922 --> 14:08.907
Yes, no, yes, without the D.

14:08.908 --> 14:11.475
'You got a callback
for "Locked" tomorrow.'

14:12.644 --> 14:15.647
- Um, uh, wait? What?
- 'Yes.'

14:15.648 --> 14:17.548
'Four o'clock, at the studio.'

14:18.984 --> 14:21.519
Okay. Thank you.

14:35.033 --> 14:36.600
Oh..

14:46.865 --> 14:48.465
'I'm sorry, Alexis. I couldn't get her.'

14:48.489 --> 14:49.366
'But she'll return.'

14:49.367 --> 14:50.968
Wait... You said that yesterday.

14:50.969 --> 14:52.336
'Look, Lexie...'

14:52.337 --> 14:54.972
'maybe you don't want to talk to him.'

14:54.973 --> 14:56.440
What is that supposed to mean?

14:56.441 --> 14:58.175
'He may be your agent'

14:58.176 --> 14:59.909
'but I still believe in you.'

15:01.011 --> 15:02.879
Thanks.

15:09.887 --> 15:12.222
I'm not choosing sides,
if that's why you're here.

15:12.223 --> 15:13.691
It's not.

15:13.692 --> 15:15.892
Did you come to protect
me from melanoma?

15:17.628 --> 15:18.761
Aah!

15:19.797 --> 15:22.967
- Drink?
- I'm sober, remember?

15:22.968 --> 15:25.536
Sorry, it's kind of hard
to keep up in this town.

15:25.537 --> 15:26.870
We were in rehab together.

15:26.871 --> 15:28.614
Yeah, but I thought
you were just doing that

15:28.615 --> 15:30.007
to spin some bad boy cred.

15:30.008 --> 15:31.442
Eh, that was my mom's idea.

15:31.443 --> 15:33.043
That's brilliant.

15:33.044 --> 15:35.613
Nina is like "Jeopardy" smart.

15:35.614 --> 15:37.680
They might offer Jordan the role of Ed.

15:40.551 --> 15:41.584
Bang me.

15:43.253 --> 15:44.888
Maybe he won't get it.

15:44.889 --> 15:47.091
We both know if Jordan
wants it, he'll get it.

15:47.092 --> 15:49.426
Rainer, can you guys
please just get over this?

15:49.427 --> 15:51.694
I feel like I'm reliving
my parents' divorce.

15:55.299 --> 15:56.967
You didn't hear it from me

15:56.968 --> 15:58.901
but it's down to you
and Dakota for August.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.339
Rain, you know how much I need this.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.708
Convince Jordan not to read

16:04.709 --> 16:06.310
and I'll make sure you get the part.

16:06.311 --> 16:08.377
How am I supposed to do that?

16:09.513 --> 16:11.180
You'll figure it out.

16:15.219 --> 16:16.754
Fine.

16:16.755 --> 16:18.254
I'll talk to him.

16:19.823 --> 16:21.324
Thank you, Lexie.

16:22.793 --> 16:25.828
- I'm not screwing him.
- Didn't ask you to.

16:45.582 --> 16:47.785
Oh, for God sakes, Paige,
just rip off that tag

16:47.786 --> 16:50.688
and walk out the door like
you own that Dolce already.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.272
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:52.273 --> 16:54.740
I think you're into more
than just his burgers.

16:56.026 --> 16:57.828
So don't give me that "He's the best

16:57.829 --> 16:59.329
guy friend you've ever had" line.

16:59.330 --> 17:01.665
He is the best guy friend I've ever had

17:01.666 --> 17:03.500
and I'm not gonna screw that up.

17:03.501 --> 17:05.135
You're already screwin' it up.

17:05.136 --> 17:07.838
By not screwing him, because
you know it's gonna happen.

17:07.839 --> 17:09.973
You're gonna wait too long,
he'll meet someone else

17:09.973 --> 17:11.374
and how are you gonna feel then?

17:13.911 --> 17:15.412
Look, you're into him

17:15.413 --> 17:17.713
and I'm pretty sure he's into you too.

17:22.653 --> 17:24.420
So do something about it.

17:27.257 --> 17:28.659
Hey, can I borrow your car?

17:28.660 --> 17:30.260
'I'm gonna meet Kyle at the Pizza Dome.'

17:30.284 --> 17:31.795
Kyle with nine toes?

17:31.796 --> 17:35.265
He has ten toes, Jake!
Just two of them are webbed.

17:35.266 --> 17:39.169
Um, you didn't, uh, get a
call about the movie, did you?

17:39.170 --> 17:40.713
Those losers wouldn't recognize talent

17:40.714 --> 17:41.972
if it sat on their faces.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.142
- See you later.
- Love you.

17:45.143 --> 17:46.576
'Love you more.'

18:01.992 --> 18:04.695
- 'Hello.'
- Hi, it's Lacey.

18:04.696 --> 18:06.495
'Come on up.'

18:22.814 --> 18:24.481
Come on in.

18:44.302 --> 18:45.936
Nice view.

18:45.937 --> 18:47.671
It's like a different city at night.

18:47.672 --> 18:49.505
I was talking about your ass.

18:52.209 --> 18:54.377
But the lights are pretty too.

18:55.245 --> 18:56.445
He sent you, right?

18:57.581 --> 19:01.084
Rainer wants you to turn down "Locked."

19:01.085 --> 19:03.053
If they make me an offer, I'm taking it.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.355
Do you really think that's a good idea?

19:05.356 --> 19:08.225
You guys can't even be
in the same room together.

19:08.226 --> 19:09.792
I'll deal with it.

19:11.295 --> 19:13.095
I know why he's so mad at you.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.466
Was it worth it?

19:18.602 --> 19:20.369
You ask a lot of questions.

19:22.072 --> 19:23.574
Yeah.

19:23.575 --> 19:25.675
It's called making conversation.

19:26.810 --> 19:28.577
Maybe you should ask me something.

19:29.513 --> 19:31.047
Wanna get naked?

19:32.816 --> 19:34.251
Why not?

19:58.743 --> 20:01.678
- What?
- What? What?

20:01.679 --> 20:03.714
- You want some ice cream?
- No.

20:03.715 --> 20:05.482
Especially not if you're eating it.

20:05.483 --> 20:08.318
Always picking around the sides
and just leaving that little

20:08.319 --> 20:10.687
hard ball in the middle
with mint chocolate

20:10.688 --> 20:12.656
beautiful chips just, just

20:12.657 --> 20:14.324
no, I don't, I don't want that.

20:14.325 --> 20:16.959
Mnh-mnh. Nobody wants that.

20:18.729 --> 20:20.663
Did I leave the toilet seat up again?

20:22.599 --> 20:24.201
Can you just...

20:24.202 --> 20:25.668
...put on a shirt, please.

20:27.631 --> 20:29.014
Why? It never bothered you before.

20:29.015 --> 20:31.909
Well... it's...

20:31.910 --> 20:34.011
...it's bothering me now obviously

20:34.012 --> 20:36.246
because I-I, I'm trying to study

20:36.247 --> 20:38.215
and y-you're, you're just standin' here

20:38.216 --> 20:39.248
with your...

20:40.517 --> 20:42.319
Are you full on mad at me right now?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.726
Uh! Uh, what, w-why are you asking me

20:44.727 --> 20:46.123
questions that I don't
know the answers to.

20:46.124 --> 20:47.787
Because you're trying
to tell me something

20:47.788 --> 20:50.060
but I-I don't read minds,
so I can't figure it out.

20:50.061 --> 20:52.763
Well, can you just stop like...

20:52.764 --> 20:55.866
...doing this while I-I'm studying...

20:55.867 --> 20:58.835
That's very rude of you to
just walk around shirtless

20:58.836 --> 21:02.139
knowing it's probably very
hard for me to concentrate.

21:02.140 --> 21:04.374
And I just, I don't really
know what to say anymore

21:04.375 --> 21:06.276
because I really want
to rip the tags off

21:06.277 --> 21:08.420
but I don't know how to
because you are my best friend

21:08.421 --> 21:10.948
and I'm just really confused
right now and I don't want to...

21:10.949 --> 21:12.749
Hey.

21:12.750 --> 21:13.949
Paige, just breathe.

21:20.824 --> 21:24.193
Uh, is there something
you guys wanna tell me?

21:27.931 --> 21:30.534
I got a call back on the movie.

21:30.535 --> 21:32.636
- 'What?'
- Yeah.

21:32.637 --> 21:34.571
Oh, my God, Paige, that's incredible.

21:34.572 --> 21:36.840
- It is?
- Yes.

21:36.841 --> 21:40.010
- You're-you're not mad at me?
- Are you serious?

21:40.011 --> 21:41.845
Would you be mad if
it was me and not you?

21:41.846 --> 21:43.180
No, of course not.

21:43.181 --> 21:45.782
Paige, this is a total game-changer.

21:45.783 --> 21:47.284
It's just a callback.

21:47.285 --> 21:49.886
Hey, let's, uh, let's
drink that champagne

21:49.887 --> 21:51.855
Cassie stole from her uncle's funeral.

21:51.856 --> 21:53.757
Um, it was a wake, and
I took a bottle to go.

21:53.758 --> 21:56.792
That's not stealing.
It's called a party favor.

21:57.661 --> 21:59.096
- Holy crap.
- Huh.

21:59.097 --> 22:01.730
Paige, do you think that
Rainer's gonna be there?

22:08.263 --> 22:09.563
'Big day for you.'

22:10.265 --> 22:11.733
Get any sleep?

22:11.734 --> 22:13.401
Um, a little.

22:13.402 --> 22:15.737
After Cassie finally stopped talking.

22:15.738 --> 22:18.540
She's excited for you.

22:18.541 --> 22:19.573
So am I.

22:23.545 --> 22:25.713
I really don't know what
I'd do without you guys.

22:28.316 --> 22:32.487
Um... I feel like last night..

22:32.488 --> 22:34.756
...before Cassie got home, there was..

22:34.757 --> 22:36.623
...maybe somethin'
else you wanted to say.

22:39.194 --> 22:43.064
Um... uh, really

22:43.065 --> 22:45.299
you felt that way?

22:48.236 --> 22:49.896
I think I know what you were gonna say.

23:04.819 --> 23:06.020
Um..

23:09.057 --> 23:10.357
Um..

23:12.227 --> 23:13.862
Wow.

23:13.863 --> 23:15.897
That's very, uh..

23:15.898 --> 23:18.566
We should talk about
this after your play.

23:18.567 --> 23:20.035
- Yeah, yeah, right.
- Um.

23:20.036 --> 23:23.672
But maybe we can grab
a drink or something.

23:23.673 --> 23:25.506
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

23:27.008 --> 23:29.510
'Did you just rip the tags off?'

23:37.152 --> 23:38.820
What are you doing here?

23:38.821 --> 23:41.389
Can you believe that Priss Hopper

23:41.390 --> 23:43.725
took a restraining order out on me.

23:43.726 --> 23:46.161
There's no loyalty in this town anymore.

23:46.162 --> 23:47.329
Why do you even care?

23:47.330 --> 23:48.897
Why do you let them get to you?

23:48.898 --> 23:50.532
I need this movie, Rain.

23:50.533 --> 23:52.367
And until we start
shooting, neither one of us

23:52.368 --> 23:54.736
can afford to make a mistake.

23:56.706 --> 23:59.174
Jordan started this, not me.

23:59.175 --> 24:01.142
And I'm a big boy, I
can take care of Barrett.

24:01.143 --> 24:04.546
Just stay out of the press
until someone yells action.

24:04.547 --> 24:07.082
I'll find a way to get rid of Hopper.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.782
When you say get rid of?

24:14.923 --> 24:18.293
- What's that smile for?
- Are these today's callbacks?

24:18.294 --> 24:20.628
'Um, we'll get them over
as quickly as possible.'

24:20.629 --> 24:22.564
Maybe we'll find
someone who surprises us.

24:22.565 --> 24:25.667
Right, and I'll tell you a bedtime story

24:25.668 --> 24:27.635
with a happy ending. What
are those called again?

24:27.636 --> 24:29.436
Oh, yeah, fairytales.

24:30.805 --> 24:35.010
Mom, are you mad at... Jordan

24:35.011 --> 24:37.412
or Barrett or me?

24:37.413 --> 24:38.979
Do I have to pick?

24:45.854 --> 24:48.056
I'm sorry if I let you down.

24:48.057 --> 24:49.690
I'm fixing it.

25:07.509 --> 25:09.310
Verouxi Magazine is
offering a million dollars

25:09.311 --> 25:13.314
for an exclusive video of the
next Jordan-Rainer smash up.

25:16.284 --> 25:18.686
Oh, my God!

25:18.687 --> 25:20.768
Nina, you're not allowed
to call me. This is illegal.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.070
I'm hanging up and dialing 911.

25:22.071 --> 25:23.391
I know what you want.

25:23.392 --> 25:24.793
And I'll get you there.

25:24.794 --> 25:27.062
But you'll have to
leave my son out of it.

25:27.063 --> 25:28.863
Why the hell should I trust you?

25:28.864 --> 25:31.232
Because the real story
isn't about Rainer.

25:31.233 --> 25:32.934
'It's about Tangey Turner.'

25:32.935 --> 25:36.271
That slut who cheated on
my son with Jordan Wilder.

25:36.272 --> 25:37.604
I'm listening.

25:39.441 --> 25:41.843
We can't forget the past, Noah.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.579
'Cause that's saying it never
happened, and that's a lie.

25:44.580 --> 25:47.015
I came back.

25:47.016 --> 25:48.716
Isn't that enough?

25:48.717 --> 25:51.218
I can't be with you
unless you can forgive me.

25:53.521 --> 25:54.955
But I do forgive you.

25:58.693 --> 26:00.428
Hey, thanks for coming in, Dakota.

26:00.429 --> 26:02.790
Are you kidding? You saved me
from having lunch with my mom.

26:02.791 --> 26:04.094
I took her to Craig's last night

26:04.095 --> 26:06.301
and she brought her
autograph book with her.

26:06.302 --> 26:08.002
It's kinda cute.

26:08.003 --> 26:11.306
It's kinda cute until she
asks your ex for his autograph.

26:12.775 --> 26:15.043
Oh, it's been real. Sort of.

26:15.044 --> 26:18.613
So we still have to play out
this "open call" thing, but..

26:18.614 --> 26:20.215
Oh, yeah, of course.

26:20.216 --> 26:22.250
Um, thanks, Rain. That was fun.

26:22.251 --> 26:23.951
For sure.

26:34.230 --> 26:36.097
Okay, this is Paige Townsend.

26:36.098 --> 26:37.866
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, it's Townsen.

26:37.867 --> 26:40.100
- There is no D at the end.
- Okay.

26:52.313 --> 26:54.982
Uh, hi, I'm Rainer.

26:56.117 --> 26:58.253
Hi! Um, I'm..

26:58.254 --> 26:59.754
...Paige, nice to meet you.

26:59.755 --> 27:01.289
Sorry if my hands are a little clammy.

27:01.290 --> 27:03.658
I actually am really nervous
'cause this is my first audition

27:03.659 --> 27:05.941
actually second if you count
the one I just had yesterday.

27:05.942 --> 27:07.542
And if my best friend Cassandra was here

27:07.543 --> 27:10.198
she'd pinch me so I'd stop
talking like a nervous goober.

27:10.199 --> 27:12.400
Did I just say goober?

27:12.401 --> 27:13.635
Do you want me to pinch you?

27:13.636 --> 27:15.570
No, um, maybe.

27:15.571 --> 27:17.738
No. Actually, no.

27:19.073 --> 27:20.674
Hey, can we start?

27:21.676 --> 27:22.943
Give us a second.

27:24.179 --> 27:26.713
- Can I tell you something?
- Oh.

27:34.722 --> 27:35.956
Thank you.

27:36.958 --> 27:38.493
We got this.

27:38.494 --> 27:40.260
Yeah, I think we do.

27:42.330 --> 27:44.064
We're ready when you are.

27:44.933 --> 27:46.467
We can't forget the past, Noah

27:46.468 --> 27:49.270
because that's like
saying it never happened.

27:49.271 --> 27:50.872
That's a lie.

27:50.873 --> 27:54.242
So what are you saying? We're over?

27:54.243 --> 27:55.809
Is that what this is?

27:57.845 --> 28:01.015
I came back. Isn't that enough?

28:01.016 --> 28:04.584
Look, I can't be with you
unless you can forgive me.

28:05.954 --> 28:07.054
But..

28:11.326 --> 28:12.793
But I do..

28:14.629 --> 28:16.229
...forgive you.

28:40.521 --> 28:41.855
Um..

28:46.527 --> 28:47.728
'Um..'

28:49.631 --> 28:52.232
Okay, well, thanks, um..

28:59.340 --> 29:01.842
Ha, uh, those doors!

29:03.511 --> 29:04.778
Who was that?

29:19.470 --> 29:22.005
Oh, hello, Miss Townsen.

29:22.006 --> 29:24.574
Yes, would you mind coming back inside?

29:24.575 --> 29:26.209
Did I do something wrong?

29:26.210 --> 29:28.145
They'd like to see you
read with another actor.

29:28.146 --> 29:29.907
- Really?
- Yes, really.

29:29.908 --> 29:31.648
Can we move? They're not
big on waiting for people.

29:31.649 --> 29:33.050
'We'll get you the
scene, and I'll make sure'

29:33.051 --> 29:34.584
'you have enough time to prepare.'

29:34.585 --> 29:36.687
Look, nobody is more surprised
by this than they are.

29:36.688 --> 29:38.954
You actually have a shot
here. So pull it together.

29:40.090 --> 29:41.959
Thank you so much for
not being mean to me

29:41.960 --> 29:43.463
'cause I could totally cry right now.

29:43.464 --> 29:45.896
- Um, save it for your audition.
- Okay.

29:45.897 --> 29:47.863
One foot in front of the other.

29:54.359 --> 29:56.440
Is this your way of telling
me I didn't get the part?

29:56.441 --> 29:59.009
No, last I heard, you
were still in the running.

29:59.010 --> 30:00.310
- Who told you that?
- Alexis.

30:00.311 --> 30:02.913
She's still waiting too. Corner booth.

30:02.914 --> 30:04.480
Drink's on her.

30:19.529 --> 30:21.297
Sorry about the mess.

30:33.043 --> 30:34.878
Well, thank you for coming back in.

30:34.879 --> 30:36.213
- Hi.
- I'm Nina

30:36.214 --> 30:38.547
and this is Jordan Wilder.

30:42.185 --> 30:43.987
'Wyatt Lippman, director.'

30:43.988 --> 30:45.322
Kateland Hess, writer.

30:49.693 --> 30:50.993
Whenever you're ready, Jordan.

30:54.931 --> 30:57.299
I'm sorry in advance
if I'm a little nervous.

30:57.901 --> 30:59.335
Let's go.

31:02.906 --> 31:04.174
I don't believe you.

31:04.175 --> 31:06.143
August, there's nothing
out there for you.

31:06.144 --> 31:08.043
And how do you know that?

31:09.679 --> 31:11.380
Because I've been there.

31:12.349 --> 31:13.983
You lied to me.

31:22.159 --> 31:24.227
'You don't have to do this.'

31:24.228 --> 31:25.895
'Yes, I do.'

31:27.764 --> 31:29.900
'Oh, when I'm gone, I'll
spend every moment I can'

31:29.901 --> 31:31.433
'remembering you.'

31:48.618 --> 31:50.420
That's fantastic.

31:50.421 --> 31:52.844
I think we should go while their
jaws are still on the floor.

31:52.845 --> 31:53.423
Yeah.

31:53.424 --> 31:55.090
'Thank you, Paige.'

31:56.293 --> 31:57.560
Goodbye.

32:01.298 --> 32:04.234
- Girl has something.
- No arguments here.

32:04.235 --> 32:05.818
When she says the words, I believe her.

32:12.143 --> 32:14.144
'I can't believe I'm saying this'

32:14.145 --> 32:17.112
but did we just find our August?

32:20.417 --> 32:21.918
I think I was too over the top.

32:21.919 --> 32:24.187
Like, "Telenovela" over the top.

32:24.188 --> 32:27.157
Back up. And you took the
scenes all the way to the kiss?

32:27.158 --> 32:30.560
Yes. And Rainer was so
romantic and Jordan..

32:30.561 --> 32:31.695
Oh, my God! Rawr!

32:31.696 --> 32:33.897
The second you get
here, we're lockin' lips.

32:33.898 --> 32:35.398
'Start from the beginning.'

32:35.399 --> 32:37.334
'I wanna hear every little detail'

32:37.335 --> 32:39.535
'and don't leave out anything.'

32:40.770 --> 32:42.072
Rainer?

32:42.073 --> 32:44.774
- You got a sec?
- Is that him?

32:44.775 --> 32:47.176
- 'You were great in there.'
- Holy crap.

32:47.978 --> 32:49.679
Oh, uh, thank you.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.281
Uh, you were too, but, uh

32:51.282 --> 32:52.585
of course you were. You are you.

32:52.586 --> 32:55.252
Would you like to...
grab a cup of coffee?

32:55.253 --> 32:56.686
Yes.

32:56.687 --> 32:58.421
To talk about the movie?

32:58.422 --> 33:01.391
No. I just thought we could hang.

33:01.392 --> 33:02.926
We? Like..

33:02.927 --> 33:05.227
...you, me, us, we?

33:05.695 --> 33:06.996
Yeah.

33:08.198 --> 33:10.100
Why?

33:10.101 --> 33:12.668
- Just say yes.
- Yes! Yes!

33:16.106 --> 33:18.508
Okay. I'll call you back.

33:18.509 --> 33:20.175
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't hang up on me.

33:39.229 --> 33:40.830
Something's wrong.

33:40.831 --> 33:42.098
Paige isn't here.

33:42.099 --> 33:43.266
I'm sure she's fine, Jake.

33:43.267 --> 33:44.834
She wouldn't miss this.

33:44.835 --> 33:46.870
Oh, unless she got into
an accident or something.

33:46.871 --> 33:48.438
She's with Rainer Devon.

33:48.439 --> 33:50.807
'Places everyone.'

33:50.808 --> 33:52.441
She's still at the audition?

33:53.410 --> 33:55.411
He asked her out for coffee.

34:07.191 --> 34:08.556
So there was this guy.

34:13.063 --> 34:14.331
I know.

34:14.331 --> 34:20.237
Um, uh, I moved to Oregon.

34:20.237 --> 34:21.469
- Oregon?
- Yeah.

34:24.474 --> 34:26.376
We did it!

34:26.377 --> 34:28.311
Thanks for coming. Thank you.

34:28.312 --> 34:30.614
- Nice play.
- Thanks.

34:30.614 --> 34:33.149
You're Jake, right? I'm Lenny.

34:33.150 --> 34:36.152
- I really dug the play.
- Oh, thanks.

34:36.152 --> 34:37.821
I work at LDM on the future lit side

34:37.822 --> 34:39.656
if you got a screenplay.

34:39.657 --> 34:41.190
I-I do, yeah.

34:41.192 --> 34:43.126
Great! Send it over. I'll take a look.

34:43.127 --> 34:44.827
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

34:48.364 --> 34:50.699
- Who was that?
- The assistant to Kevin Stone.

34:50.701 --> 34:52.268
- From LDM.
- Oh, my God.

34:52.270 --> 34:54.103
That's like a totally legit agency.

34:54.105 --> 34:57.207
Hey, hey, guys. Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

34:57.208 --> 34:58.942
- Hi.
- Jake got an agent.

34:58.943 --> 35:00.143
I got an assistant's card.

35:00.144 --> 35:01.378
What? Oh, my God!

35:01.379 --> 35:02.612
Okay, enough about you.

35:02.613 --> 35:05.048
- Kiss me right now.
- What?

35:05.049 --> 35:06.383
I'm not taking no for an answer.

35:06.384 --> 35:08.818
I'm kissing the lips that
made out with Rainer Devon

35:08.819 --> 35:09.953
and Jordan Wilder.

35:09.954 --> 35:13.256
Um, that was hardly a make-out session

35:13.257 --> 35:15.425
that was just an audition.

35:15.426 --> 35:18.428
It doesn't matter,
Paige. It still counts.

35:18.429 --> 35:20.630
- Happy?
- Oh.

35:20.631 --> 35:22.334
- Is that better for you?
- Yeah, I'm good.

35:22.335 --> 35:23.700
- Can you breathe?
- No.

35:23.701 --> 35:26.803
Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, I'm good.

35:26.804 --> 35:28.984
- I think I'm good, yeah.
- Wanna go grab that drink?

35:29.239 --> 35:30.240
Um..

35:31.676 --> 35:34.611
- Rainer has your number?
- Um.

35:34.612 --> 35:36.212
You should probably answer that.

35:36.213 --> 35:39.549
No, no, I.. Uh, no, you know,
I can just text him back.

35:39.550 --> 35:41.813
- It's you guys' night..
- Hi, Rainer, this is Cassandra.

35:41.814 --> 35:43.820
- Shh. Cassie..
- I really love you.

35:43.821 --> 35:45.355
Paige.

35:45.356 --> 35:47.524
I wanted to call you personally.

35:47.525 --> 35:49.726
Look, I did the best I can do, you know.

35:49.727 --> 35:52.495
There's-there's nothing I
can do about it at this point.

35:52.496 --> 35:53.796
You got the part.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.101
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

35:58.102 --> 35:59.669
- Oh.
- What?

35:59.670 --> 36:02.105
Oh, Paige, this is
gonna change your life.

36:02.106 --> 36:04.274
Oh, my God.

36:04.275 --> 36:05.742
Let's celebrate. Where are you?

36:05.743 --> 36:07.010
'I'll send a car.'

36:07.011 --> 36:08.244
Wow!

36:08.245 --> 36:12.515
Uh... that's so sweet of you actually

36:12.516 --> 36:15.518
but, you know, my friends just
put on their very first play

36:15.519 --> 36:18.054
and, um, I'm gonna be
celebrating with them tonight.

36:18.055 --> 36:19.621
So let's make it a party.

36:22.859 --> 36:25.795
I mean, I'm not going without you.

36:25.796 --> 36:27.330
Well, then let's go to a party.

36:27.331 --> 36:29.332
- Oh, my God!
- Let's go to a party.

36:37.207 --> 36:39.075
I bought you that coat.

36:39.076 --> 36:40.899
I thought you weren't
talking to me right now.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.412
- I'm not.
- Really?

36:42.413 --> 36:44.347
'Cause your lips are
moving, and all I'm hearing

36:44.348 --> 36:46.416
is blah blah blah.

36:46.417 --> 36:48.918
You've had enough.

36:48.919 --> 36:51.553
I liked you better when
you weren't talking.

36:54.457 --> 36:56.425
I didn't go to Jordan's
to sleep with him.

36:58.128 --> 36:59.896
Maybe I did.

36:59.897 --> 37:01.498
You have every right to be mad at me.

37:01.499 --> 37:02.998
I'm mad at me right now.

37:04.868 --> 37:07.236
Can you believe I
didn't even get the part?

37:08.271 --> 37:09.905
'They gave it to a nobody.'

37:12.742 --> 37:14.911
I'm afraid to call my agent back

37:14.912 --> 37:17.881
because I'm scared that
she's gonna dump me.

37:17.882 --> 37:20.383
You just need one hit, baby,
and you'll be back on top.

37:20.384 --> 37:22.652
I hate this town.

37:22.653 --> 37:24.287
And I hate keeping us a secret.

37:24.288 --> 37:26.388
Shut up and kiss me.

38:13.336 --> 38:15.304
I'm surprised you called.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.942
Look, I didn't swing first.

39:01.785 --> 39:03.319
Are you okay?

39:03.320 --> 39:04.620
Yeah.

39:19.136 --> 39:20.737
Who's in there?

39:20.738 --> 39:23.072
Rainer Devon is inside.
They cast "Locked" today.

39:23.073 --> 39:25.040
He's waiting for his new co-star.
