WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.462
Mm, I'm starving.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.672
What's for dinner?

00:04.713 --> 00:06.966
Leftover parfait.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.550
It's even worse than it sounds.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.135
Once a week, Mom

00:08.592 --> 00:10.135
cleans out the fridge.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.888
Anything that doesn't actually

00:10.177 --> 00:12.888
have something growing on it

00:12.930 --> 00:15.182
gets thrown in a casserole

00:12.930 --> 00:15.182
and served for dinner.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.312
Did we have spaghetti or

00:17.726 --> 00:20.312
Chinese food on Thursday?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.897
Neither.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.149
(grunting)

00:24.191 --> 00:26.902
Ah-ah, no digging!

00:29.780 --> 00:31.699
Sunday, Saturday, Friday...

00:31.740 --> 00:33.158
It finally happened.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.119
The fifth level of this week's

00:33.200 --> 00:36.119
leftover parfait

00:36.161 --> 00:38.789
is last week's leftover parfait.

All right, everyone,

01:12.031 --> 01:14.033
these...

01:14.074 --> 01:16.117
are your secret shopper

01:14.074 --> 01:16.117
evaluations,

01:16.159 --> 01:17.703
and I'm going

01:16.159 --> 01:17.703
to be meeting

01:17.745 --> 01:20.330
with each one of you

01:17.745 --> 01:20.330
individually this week

01:20.372 --> 01:22.416
so we can discuss...

01:22.457 --> 01:24.043
how we can make improvements.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.169
Look forward to it, sir.

01:27.963 --> 01:28.964
Secret shoppers?

01:29.006 --> 01:30.507
They sent people in

01:29.006 --> 01:30.507
to spy on us?

01:30.549 --> 01:33.134
What's next-- cavity searches

01:30.549 --> 01:33.134
on the loading dock?

01:33.176 --> 01:34.636
Come on, Craig,

01:33.176 --> 01:34.636
it's no big deal.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.014
Companies do this kind

01:34.678 --> 01:37.014
of thing all the time.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.139
But it's not fair!

01:38.181 --> 01:40.183
How can I be expected

01:38.181 --> 01:40.183
to work hard

01:40.225 --> 01:43.020
if I don't even know

01:40.225 --> 01:43.020
they're watching me?

01:43.062 --> 01:44.145
Craig, will you calm down?

01:44.187 --> 01:45.397
Look, it's like a paragraph.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.148
"Employee seemed

01:45.439 --> 01:47.148
very capable,

01:47.190 --> 01:48.149
"efficient, polite.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.860
Personal hygiene

01:48.191 --> 01:49.860
was questionable."

01:49.902 --> 01:51.152
Questionable?

01:51.194 --> 01:52.404
What are they

01:51.194 --> 01:52.404
talking about?

01:52.446 --> 01:53.864
My hy...

01:53.906 --> 01:57.158
"Slovenly"?

01:57.200 --> 01:59.870
They think I'm slovenly?

01:59.912 --> 02:01.622
You're right, Lois,

01:59.912 --> 02:01.622
this is ridiculous.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.164
"Apathetic, lazy,

02:01.663 --> 02:03.164
overweight."

02:03.206 --> 02:05.208
What planet are

02:03.206 --> 02:05.208
these people from?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.210
I'm taking a fiver.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.172
HAL: There's electricity

02:08.629 --> 02:11.172
in the air tonight, folks.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.592
I'm open, I'm open!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.427
We've been playing basketball

02:13.634 --> 02:15.427
with Dad since we

02:15.469 --> 02:17.345
were old enough to walk.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.345
What are you going

02:15.469 --> 02:17.345
to do, Reese?

02:17.387 --> 02:18.555
I'm open!

02:17.387 --> 02:18.555
What are you doing to do, huh?

02:18.597 --> 02:19.890
(laughs)

02:19.932 --> 02:21.308
Oh!

02:22.893 --> 02:25.646
Yes, another basket for Hal!

02:25.687 --> 02:27.188
He's on fire!

02:27.230 --> 02:29.190
We're 0 and 342.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.819
We're starting to get

02:29.232 --> 02:31.819
a little discouraged.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.113
(cackling):

02:31.860 --> 02:34.113
Game point.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.406
You take it out.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.658
This is our last chance.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.867
What do we do?

02:38.909 --> 02:41.202
Give it to me.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.204
Let's try another

02:41.244 --> 02:43.204
give-and-go.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.790
Dewey, you run

02:43.246 --> 02:44.790
to the basket

02:44.832 --> 02:46.333
and run around the pole.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.128
Ooh, come on, baby.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.712
That's it.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.712
DEWEY: Pass!

02:50.754 --> 02:52.255
I'm open!

02:52.297 --> 02:55.216
Oh, stolen by the Halinator.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.927
He shoots...

02:56.969 --> 02:58.303
He scores!

02:58.345 --> 03:01.389
Hal-elujah!

03:01.431 --> 03:02.891
Great game, boys.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.268
Good hustle.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.645
I hate this.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.064
If I want to be humiliated,

03:06.687 --> 03:09.064
I can take a math test.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.984
Wait a minute-- look.

03:16.947 --> 03:17.948
Yeah.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.240
Dewey, get away from my ball!

03:19.282 --> 03:21.702
No-- he's making baskets.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.662
He's never been able

03:21.743 --> 03:23.662
to do that before.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.288
You're right.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.833
That's how we're

03:25.330 --> 03:27.833
going to beat Dad.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.459
With Dewey.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.254
All right, which one

03:30.878 --> 03:33.254
of you filthy thieves

03:33.296 --> 03:35.256
has been rooting

03:33.296 --> 03:35.256
through my undies?

03:35.298 --> 03:36.341
What are you talking about?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.927
I'm saying one of you

03:36.383 --> 03:38.927
went through my footlocker

03:38.969 --> 03:41.096
and ate all my jerky.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.139
It wasn't us, Artie.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.140
Looks like a rat did it.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.766
Yeah, look at

03:43.182 --> 03:44.766
those teeth marks.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.267
Let's not jump

03:44.808 --> 03:46.267
to any conclusions.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.686
Think about

03:46.309 --> 03:47.686
it logically.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.480
If the rat was so filled up

03:47.728 --> 03:50.480
with Artie's jerky,

03:50.522 --> 03:53.901
would he be chewing on

03:50.522 --> 03:53.901
Francis' pillow right now?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.235
What?

03:55.819 --> 03:57.863
Get him!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.114
Die, vermin!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.450
(whimpering)

04:02.492 --> 04:04.244
(screams)

04:06.329 --> 04:08.248
(muffled scream)

04:11.543 --> 04:13.170
Wow.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.297
Francis, you killed it.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.009
And it did eat

04:16.339 --> 04:19.009
your jerky.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.302
Okay, we've got you

04:20.052 --> 04:21.302
double-bagged

04:21.344 --> 04:22.345
in paper and plastic.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.098
That hair mousse

04:22.387 --> 04:24.098
that I recommended

04:24.139 --> 04:25.933
is bagged separately

04:24.139 --> 04:25.933
with your other sundries

04:25.974 --> 04:27.768
and I picked up your film

04:25.974 --> 04:27.768
at the photo counter.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.310
Can I take this out

04:27.809 --> 04:29.310
to your car for you?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.188
You don't have

04:29.352 --> 04:31.188
to do that for me.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.024
Nonsense. That's my job here

04:31.230 --> 04:34.024
at Lucky Aide.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.776
Oh!

04:35.817 --> 04:38.403
(whispers):

04:35.817 --> 04:38.403
Pay it forward.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.697
Hey, Lois.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.740
Mr. Fisher,

04:41.782 --> 04:42.908
I wanted to talk

04:41.782 --> 04:42.908
to you about

04:42.950 --> 04:43.909
that secret

04:42.950 --> 04:43.909
shopper report.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.535
I think that they must

04:43.951 --> 04:45.535
have come in on the day

04:45.577 --> 04:47.412
that my son Dewey tried

04:45.577 --> 04:47.412
to cook his own breakfast,

04:47.454 --> 04:48.914
and by the time

04:47.454 --> 04:48.914
I put out the fire...

04:48.956 --> 04:50.791
Lois, this isn't personal.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.542
Well, it's...

04:52.584 --> 04:54.002
It's not like I'm...

04:54.044 --> 04:57.505
Lois, there is nothing

04:54.044 --> 04:57.505
for you to freak out over.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.800
And we have people

04:57.547 --> 04:59.800
in the company

04:59.841 --> 05:04.138
with the skills and

04:59.841 --> 05:04.138
the experience to help you.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.432
Wow, Lois, this is, like,

05:04.179 --> 05:07.432
going to be so fun!

05:11.394 --> 05:13.188
Okay, let's try it

05:11.394 --> 05:13.188
one more time.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.361
(Reese laughs)

05:18.568 --> 05:20.361
Yes.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.363
Perfect. Dad won't have

05:20.403 --> 05:22.363
any idea what hit him.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.364
He's going down.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.407
You think he'll cry?

05:24.449 --> 05:27.327
Oh, yeah. He'll cry.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.622
You know, you have

05:29.121 --> 05:30.622
really pretty eyes.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.373
You shouldn't hide them

05:30.664 --> 05:32.373
behind no makeup.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.458
This is wrong.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.626
I do my job.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.669
I do my job well.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.838
I dress appropriately

05:35.710 --> 05:37.838
and I am clean.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.464
That should be enough.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.591
Or you could be pretty.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.801
Put your chin up.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.094
What do they want from me?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.386
I take care of three kids.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.387
I run a house.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.597
I work 38 hours a week

05:47.639 --> 05:49.975
and they think I should

05:47.639 --> 05:49.975
look like some supermodel

05:50.017 --> 05:51.852
just to ring up some

05:50.017 --> 05:51.852
guy's rash ointment?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.312
You tell me

05:51.893 --> 05:53.312
how that's fair.

05:53.352 --> 05:56.439
You know, Lois, it's okay

05:53.352 --> 05:56.439
to be scared of change.

05:56.481 --> 06:00.277
I mean, my boyfriend freaked

05:56.481 --> 06:00.277
when I got my driver's license.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.778
Don't worry.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.655
I'll take good care of you.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.032
(door closing)

06:05.073 --> 06:06.491
Oh, God, Hal,

06:05.073 --> 06:06.491
you wouldn't believe

06:06.533 --> 06:08.409
what happened to me

06:06.533 --> 06:08.409
at work today.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.494
I had to spend five hours

06:09.536 --> 06:12.831
with this stuff on my face

06:09.536 --> 06:12.831
in front of everybody!

06:12.873 --> 06:16.375
I've never been

06:12.873 --> 06:16.375
so humiliated...

06:26.261 --> 06:28.680
(birds chirping)

06:34.186 --> 06:35.436
You're the most

06:34.186 --> 06:35.436
beautiful woman

06:35.478 --> 06:40.359
that ever was

06:35.478 --> 06:40.359
or ever could be.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.449
Hey, Francis,

06:48.491 --> 06:50.493
I heard you killed

06:48.491 --> 06:50.493
a rat yesterday.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.494
Is that right?

06:51.536 --> 06:52.495
What?

06:52.537 --> 06:53.872
Yes, sir.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.872
He's the one.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.249
Good.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.708
I, uh, I got a rat

06:55.290 --> 06:56.708
problem in my bunk.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.919
I'd be much obliged

06:56.750 --> 06:58.919
if you took care of it.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.379
Oh, I don't think...

07:00.419 --> 07:01.462
He would be honored.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.714
We both would.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.549
Great.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.051
What are you doing?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.303
I don't know anything

07:06.093 --> 07:08.303
about killing rats.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.471
Who cares?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.471
Do you like mopping?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.057
Do you want to see what

07:10.513 --> 07:12.057
they start tracking in here

07:12.099 --> 07:13.474
during bear season?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.524
Come on, baby,

07:19.522 --> 07:21.524
bring it on.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.277
You think I'm

07:21.566 --> 07:23.277
scared of you?

07:23.318 --> 07:25.737
I changed your diapers.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.739
Whoo-hoo.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.746
Dewey, you made

07:31.451 --> 07:34.746
a basket.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.458
Good for you!

07:39.459 --> 07:40.961
(panting)

07:45.006 --> 07:46.216
All right.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.508
Yeah.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.969
Yeah.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.348
What are you looking at?

07:57.227 --> 07:59.813
♪ ♪

08:05.193 --> 08:06.527
(grunts)

08:06.569 --> 08:08.405
Oww!

08:08.447 --> 08:10.198
Sorry, son.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.741
(grunts)

08:10.240 --> 08:11.741
Hey!

08:11.783 --> 08:13.160
Whoa!

08:13.201 --> 08:14.244
(whoops)

08:14.286 --> 08:16.496
Rejected!

08:19.624 --> 08:21.584
(laughing)

08:21.626 --> 08:24.129
Good game, boys.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.255
Good game?

08:25.297 --> 08:26.547
You fouled us

08:25.297 --> 08:26.547
on every play.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.133
Boys, part of the game

08:28.175 --> 08:30.135
is learning how

08:28.175 --> 08:30.135
to lose gracefully.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.053
I mean, if I've

08:30.177 --> 08:32.053
taught you anything

08:32.095 --> 08:34.514
it's how to be

08:32.095 --> 08:34.514
a good sportsman, hmm?

08:40.603 --> 08:43.023
I guess the rat could be

08:40.603 --> 08:43.023
coming out of this hole here.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.565
What are you

08:43.064 --> 08:44.565
going to do?

08:44.607 --> 08:46.567
We could try

08:44.607 --> 08:46.567
to lure him out.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.528
Anyone have a cookie

08:46.609 --> 08:48.528
or anything?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.583
(squeaking)

09:02.625 --> 09:04.461
It worked.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.461
You did it.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.796
I did.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.841
Well, kill him.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.559
Yes! He did it!

09:20.935 --> 09:23.604
That was amazing,

09:20.935 --> 09:23.604
Francis.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.358
You have the gift.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.610
Hi, Lois.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.653
I was at the coffee place

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
and just thought

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
I'd pick you up a latte.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.615
Thanks.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.617
(indistinct announcement

09:34.657 --> 09:36.617
over P.A.)

09:36.659 --> 09:37.702
What are you

09:36.659 --> 09:37.702
doing, Lois?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.205
You shouldn't be

09:37.744 --> 09:40.205
lifting those

09:37.744 --> 09:40.205
heavy boxes.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.332
I always do it.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.876
I'll take care of it.

09:44.918 --> 09:45.835
Hold it a second.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.628
You've watched me

09:45.877 --> 09:47.628
pick up boxes

09:47.670 --> 09:48.796
every day for four years.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
Suddenly, now you want

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
to help me?

09:50.673 --> 09:51.925
Why?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.552
I don't know...

09:51.966 --> 09:53.552
I just thought...

09:53.593 --> 09:55.095
No, you look me

09:53.593 --> 09:55.095
in the face

09:55.136 --> 09:56.471
and you tell me why.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.931
I don't know.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.349
I'm sorry.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.102
I'm just going to go

09:59.391 --> 10:02.102
get lunch, okay?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.729
Can I get you anything?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.525
(low chatter)

10:19.369 --> 10:20.454
How'd it go?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.163
Well, Buzz,

10:20.495 --> 10:22.163
I don't want to bore you

10:22.205 --> 10:23.664
with the technical details,

10:23.706 --> 10:25.833
so let's just say

10:23.706 --> 10:25.833
that cabin 15

10:25.875 --> 10:28.462
is once again rodent free.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.921
(cheering)

10:29.963 --> 10:32.507
Three cheers

10:29.963 --> 10:32.507
for Francis.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.260
ALL:

10:32.549 --> 10:35.260
Hip-hip, hooray!

10:35.302 --> 10:37.387
MAN:

10:35.302 --> 10:37.387
What are you fools

10:35.302 --> 10:37.387
cheering about?

10:37.429 --> 10:41.308
You caught yourself

10:37.429 --> 10:41.308
a couple of tiny rats.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.602
Whoop-dee-dee.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.479
You ain't nothing

10:45.520 --> 10:46.854
until you take out a real rat.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.942
You ain't nothing

10:46.896 --> 10:50.942
until you dance in the moonlight

10:50.984 --> 10:53.069
with Rose Marie.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.404
(chuckling)

10:54.446 --> 10:55.696
Who?

10:55.738 --> 10:59.618
They ain't told you about

10:55.738 --> 10:59.618
Rose Marie, eh?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.496
Well, she is the biggest,

10:59.659 --> 11:02.496
ugliest, meanest rat

11:02.537 --> 11:03.997
north of Kotzebue.

11:04.038 --> 11:08.709
Lives right here

11:04.038 --> 11:08.709
under this here building.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.379
Come on, Rose Marie

11:08.751 --> 11:11.379
ain't real.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.965
Yeah, she's just

11:11.421 --> 11:13.965
a creepy old myth

11:14.007 --> 11:17.177
like the Stonehenge

11:14.007 --> 11:17.177
or boxing kangaroos.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.221
She's as real as you and me.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.724
So, what do you say, rat boy?

11:23.766 --> 11:25.435
You think you're man enough?

11:25.477 --> 11:26.727
(cackling)

11:26.769 --> 11:32.526
Old man, you better start

11:26.769 --> 11:32.526
building a very small coffin.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.319
MALCOLM:

11:32.567 --> 11:34.319
So Reese sets the pick here

11:34.361 --> 11:36.904
and I get the dish

11:34.361 --> 11:36.904
off of Dewey.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.658
See? We just keep moving

11:36.946 --> 11:39.658
the ball around the perimeter.

11:39.698 --> 11:42.619
He can't cover all three of us

11:42.661 --> 11:43.870
no matter how dirty

11:42.661 --> 11:43.870
he plays.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.749
Wow!

11:48.791 --> 11:49.792
Very nice.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.752
Great ball movement.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.463
You guys are looking

11:51.794 --> 11:53.463
really good.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.589
I'm impressed.

11:54.631 --> 11:55.923
I'd be really worried

11:55.965 --> 11:58.759
if I didn't have my

11:55.965 --> 11:58.759
patented fall-away jump shot.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.761
Whoo! Ow!

12:00.803 --> 12:01.929
(groaning)

12:01.971 --> 12:03.598
Oh, my ankle!

12:03.640 --> 12:05.141
Oh, I twisted my ankle.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.185
Help me into the house, boys.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.566
Boys.

12:12.607 --> 12:16.528
Sure, Dad, we'll help you.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.864
(grunting)

12:21.115 --> 12:23.868
Ooh. (groans)

12:31.334 --> 12:33.253
Hey, boys. What's up?

12:33.294 --> 12:34.212
Not much.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.422
How's the leg?

12:35.463 --> 12:37.257
I think

12:35.463 --> 12:37.257
it's feeling a little better.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.634
It's interesting how you just

12:37.298 --> 12:39.634
happened to hurt your leg.

12:39.676 --> 12:40.968
What does that mean?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.262
I don't know.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.722
It's just

12:42.303 --> 12:43.722
interesting.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.806
Yeah. Interesting.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.183
All right,

12:45.848 --> 12:47.183
what are you boys getting at?

12:47.225 --> 12:48.809
It's just that  some

12:47.225 --> 12:48.809
people are willing

12:48.851 --> 12:50.311
to go to pretty

12:48.851 --> 12:50.311
drastic lengths

12:50.353 --> 12:52.230
just to avoid being

12:50.353 --> 12:52.230
beaten by their kids.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.981
This is about basketball?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.191
You think I faked this

12:55.233 --> 12:57.860
because I didn't want

12:55.233 --> 12:57.860
to play you in basketball?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.279
You know what?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.239
I'm going to play you

12:59.320 --> 13:01.239
right now-- like this--

13:01.281 --> 13:03.491
and I'm still going to

13:01.281 --> 13:03.491
mop the floor with you!

13:03.533 --> 13:04.701
That's okay.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.826
You rest.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.869
We can wait.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.373
Yeah. It's got

13:06.911 --> 13:10.373
to heal sometime, right?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.461
Here you go.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.878
I had to move

13:14.502 --> 13:15.878
a couple dozen bags

13:15.920 --> 13:17.505
of charcoal briquettes

13:17.547 --> 13:20.258
but I found the slightly

13:17.547 --> 13:20.258
darker blue one that you wanted.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.427
I got a few spider bites,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.427
but none of that matters

13:22.469 --> 13:24.887
as long as you, the customer,

13:22.469 --> 13:24.887
go home satisfied.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.349
You're welcome.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.850
Excuse me.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.894
Where are

13:29.892 --> 13:31.894
your dog toys?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.938
Yes, ma'am.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.938
They're right there.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.356
Right behind you.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.857
Those are leashes!

13:36.899 --> 13:38.859
If I could

13:36.899 --> 13:38.859
direct your attention

13:38.901 --> 13:40.528
three inches to the right.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.488
I want that

13:41.529 --> 13:44.532
little hot dog

13:41.529 --> 13:44.532
up on top.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.867
Sure thing.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.870
I... I see we have one

13:46.909 --> 13:49.870
just like it right here.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.872
That isn't

13:49.912 --> 13:51.872
what I asked for.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.124
This has mustard on it!

13:53.166 --> 13:55.293
Peekaboo doesn't eat mustard!

13:56.795 --> 13:59.380
Well, I can see the one up there

13:56.795 --> 13:59.380
has mustard on it, too,

13:59.422 --> 14:01.716
and since it's not

13:59.422 --> 14:01.716
even real mustard...

14:01.758 --> 14:03.926
Are you going to give me

14:01.758 --> 14:03.926
what I ask for?!

14:03.968 --> 14:06.304
Certainly.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.888
(toy squeaks)

14:19.859 --> 14:20.985
There you go.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.821
Thanks for shopping

14:21.027 --> 14:22.821
Lucky Aide.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.198
This has mustard on it!

14:25.239 --> 14:27.908
That's what I tried

14:25.239 --> 14:27.908
to tell you, you old bat!

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
Now, you're going

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
to take it to your dog

14:29.952 --> 14:31.245
and make him like it!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.878
(toys squeaking)

14:41.214 --> 14:43.924
Hey, Lois, listen, I'm real

14:41.214 --> 14:43.924
sorry to do this to you

14:43.966 --> 14:46.344
but my brother got

14:43.966 --> 14:46.344
hockey tickets for tonight

14:46.386 --> 14:47.970
and I know I said

14:46.386 --> 14:47.970
I'd close up for you...

14:48.012 --> 14:49.972
Tom, I've already

14:48.012 --> 14:49.972
rearranged my schedule.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.974
Besides, I covered

14:50.014 --> 14:51.974
for you last week.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.018
Well, I'm sorry, Lois.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.944
Gee, Tom, I really

15:01.150 --> 15:03.944
don't know what to do.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.155
Isn't there any way at all

15:06.197 --> 15:08.366
you could be just

15:06.197 --> 15:08.366
a little late for your game?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.618
Well, I guess so.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.620
Thanks.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.923
(grunts)

15:45.319 --> 15:47.447
Ha!

15:49.323 --> 15:52.952
Get your sneakers, faker.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.963
(trapdoor slams)

16:06.633 --> 16:08.008
PETE:

16:06.633 --> 16:08.008
Francis?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.009
Yeah?

16:09.051 --> 16:13.598
If you die, can I

16:09.051 --> 16:13.598
have your pillow?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.850
I already promised it to Artie.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.270
(sniffing)

16:24.358 --> 16:26.444
Gotcha.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.070
I found her tracks!

16:28.112 --> 16:29.489
You hear that?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.031
He said I get his pillow.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.199
Wait a minute!

16:32.241 --> 16:33.993
I see something!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.419
Oh!

16:43.461 --> 16:45.755
I see a baby rat!

16:45.797 --> 16:49.049
No wonder Rose Marie's

16:45.797 --> 16:49.049
so fierce.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.050
She's a mother!

16:50.092 --> 16:52.136
Well, go ahead and kill it!

16:52.178 --> 16:53.930
I don't want to kill a baby.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.055
It's a rat!

16:55.097 --> 16:57.308
All right.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.105
Hey, this wood is rotten.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.357
Just a second.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.025
I think I can get to it.

17:10.154 --> 17:15.535
(screaming)

17:18.037 --> 17:19.330
(screaming continues)

17:19.372 --> 17:24.084
(screaming echoes)

17:28.130 --> 17:30.049
(grunting)

17:33.427 --> 17:34.637
Yes.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.515
That's 14-13.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.599
We're up.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.100
Game point.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.478
Well, I have to say you boys

17:40.142 --> 17:42.478
have put up a good fight

17:42.520 --> 17:44.814
which is just going to make it

17:42.520 --> 17:44.814
all the more painful

17:44.856 --> 17:47.859
when I crush you like bugs.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.992
(laughing)

17:56.951 --> 17:59.078
Score, yeah!

17:56.951 --> 17:59.078
(whoops)

18:00.162 --> 18:02.122
Ha, tie game.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.833
Next basket wins.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.752
My ball.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.130
We have to do the play.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.131
We can't.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.174
We only practiced it once.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.426
It won't work.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.510
It will work.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.429
We just got to believe.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.347
It's go time, ladies.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.061
♪ ♪

18:51.714 --> 18:53.633
(groaning)

18:57.511 --> 19:01.057
The future is now, old man.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.687
(pained grunting)

19:11.233 --> 19:13.027
Hey, Lois.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.194
I just want to thank you

19:14.236 --> 19:16.614
for the terrific job

19:14.236 --> 19:16.614
you've done this week.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.365
You have shown

19:16.656 --> 19:18.365
a marked improvement

19:18.407 --> 19:19.575
in both your performance

19:19.617 --> 19:21.119
and your attitude.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.620
That's nice of you

19:21.160 --> 19:22.620
to say, Mr. Fisher,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.789
but really, I haven't

19:22.662 --> 19:24.789
done anything different.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.624
There's that great attitude.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.792
Anyhow, I think we're

19:27.834 --> 19:29.209
going to have an

19:27.834 --> 19:29.209
opening pretty soon

19:29.251 --> 19:30.294
in customer service.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.796
Really?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.213
It wouldn't be much of

19:31.838 --> 19:33.213
a raise in pay,

19:33.255 --> 19:35.257
but you wouldn't have to work

19:33.255 --> 19:35.257
any more late nights.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.093
That would be great.

19:37.135 --> 19:40.096
Now, you would have to dress up

19:37.135 --> 19:40.096
your appearance a little.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.681
Excuse me?

19:41.722 --> 19:44.642
You know, just

19:41.722 --> 19:44.642
a little more... feminine.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.226
More feminine?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.479
Well, you're on

19:46.268 --> 19:48.479
the right track.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.107
Just a little... more.

19:51.149 --> 19:54.944
Uh, can I let

19:51.149 --> 19:54.944
you know tomorrow?

19:54.986 --> 19:56.904
Sure thing.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.207
Damn.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.252
Hi.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.462
Hello.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.132
Can I help you?

20:16.174 --> 20:17.675
I don't know, maybe.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.259
What'll it cost me?

20:19.301 --> 20:20.260
What?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.138
Is it cheaper

20:20.302 --> 20:22.138
if we use my car

20:22.180 --> 20:23.890
or do we have

20:22.180 --> 20:23.890
to get a room?

20:23.931 --> 20:26.475
You think I'm a hooker?

20:26.517 --> 20:27.560
No.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.978
You do!

20:29.020 --> 20:31.105
You think I'm a hooker!

20:32.773 --> 20:34.692
Thank you!

20:34.734 --> 20:36.235
Come with me.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.696
A prostitute.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.365
This guy was convinced

20:38.738 --> 20:41.365
I was a prostitute.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.118
You know, ever since

20:41.407 --> 20:44.118
I got your stupid report

20:44.160 --> 20:45.912
I have been feeling

20:44.160 --> 20:45.912
like everything

20:45.953 --> 20:47.287
I ever believed in

20:45.953 --> 20:47.287
was wrong.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.748
Well, I think

20:47.329 --> 20:48.748
this little incident

20:48.789 --> 20:50.541
gives both of us

20:48.789 --> 20:50.541
some much-needed clarity.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.085
I'm going to go home now.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.293
I'm going to wash my face

20:53.335 --> 20:54.670
and when I come

20:53.335 --> 20:54.670
to work tomorrow,

20:54.712 --> 20:57.090
I'm going to do the same

20:54.712 --> 20:57.090
extraordinarily good job

20:57.131 --> 20:58.382
I've been doing

20:57.131 --> 20:58.382
all these years.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.801
I'm going to do it

20:58.424 --> 21:00.801
in my 99-cent mascara

21:00.843 --> 21:04.138
and if the mood strikes me,

21:00.843 --> 21:04.138
a hair clip, and that's it.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.474
And if that's not good enough

21:04.180 --> 21:07.474
for you, so be it.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.144
Thank you.

21:12.813 --> 21:17.693
Well, Steve, are you going

21:12.813 --> 21:17.693
to tell my sister or should I?

21:17.735 --> 21:20.320
(grumbling)

21:20.362 --> 21:23.282
This place is a pigsty.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.286
Hal, will you hand me the...

21:30.831 --> 21:32.666
Hal...?
