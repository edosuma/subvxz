Ognian, followed by...

00:08.698 --> 00:09.775
Ognian?

00:09.776 --> 00:11.744
- New finance minister.
- Ah, right.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.946
Then your monthly
ambassador's roundtable

00:13.947 --> 00:16.148
with local NGO leaders at 10:00.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.416
Cool. Who we got this month?

00:17.417 --> 00:19.451

(ALL SHOUTING, SCREAMING)

00:39.172 --> 00:41.573
I can't feel my ears.

00:41.574 --> 00:42.841
Maybe you should've worn a hat.

00:42.842 --> 00:45.778
I can't, I'm wearing fancy hair.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.312
Men never get that.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.680
(SIGHS)

00:48.681 --> 00:51.750
Listen, I really want
to hold onto my gloves.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.252
But is that tacky?

00:53.253 --> 00:55.354
Uh, hey, we have had
colder weather than this.

00:55.355 --> 00:56.321
I don't know...

00:56.322 --> 00:58.624
When? Henry, it is two degrees.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.825
Two.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.494
It's not enough degrees
for a basketball team.

01:02.495 --> 01:04.495
Boot camp, Lake County, Illinois.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.466
T-That December, it was
consistently in the negatives.

01:07.467 --> 01:08.934
You don't remember that?

01:08.935 --> 01:12.171
It's all a blur of newlywed bliss.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.138
Oh.

01:15.974 --> 01:18.977
Bet Prime Minister
Soeda is pining away

01:18.978 --> 01:22.047
for the balmy shores
of Tokyo right now.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.249
Hope it doesn't damage
our relationship.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.651
Oh, I'm sure Conrad will ply him

01:25.652 --> 01:26.919
with the finest American spirits.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.886
(LAUGHS)

01:27.887 --> 01:29.822
Nothing to warm you up like a dose

01:29.823 --> 01:31.890
of Thomas Jefferson's Reserve.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.425
KAT: Madam Secretary.

01:33.426 --> 01:37.262
Kat. Oh, man, I wished
I'd held onto my coat.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.464
Have you met my husband, Henry?

01:39.465 --> 01:40.999
No. I've heard so much about you.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.195
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. McCord.
- You, too, Kat.

01:43.196 --> 01:44.970
Uh, ma'am, our embassy in Bulgaria

01:44.971 --> 01:46.338
is reporting some kind of... attack.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.173
What do you mean?

01:48.174 --> 01:49.474
A military attack?

01:49.475 --> 01:50.609
We're not sure where it's coming from.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.877
What kind of weaponry?

01:51.878 --> 01:53.779
Sound.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.614
Thank you, Lucy.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.982
A sonic attack.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.016
Really?

01:58.017 --> 01:59.318
That's what it sounds like, sir.

01:59.319 --> 02:00.786
I... so to speak.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.355
Sounds more like something
out of <i>Star Trek.</i>

02:03.356 --> 02:04.489
It's the Russians, isn't it?

02:04.490 --> 02:05.591
Where's Ephraim?

02:05.592 --> 02:06.859
On his way, sir.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.695
I'm not aware of any
evidence pointing to Russia.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.795
But I did just speak

02:10.797 --> 02:12.164
with Ambassador Williams.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.799
And? How is he?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.901
Rattled, but hanging in there.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.570
About 20 FSOs are being
treated for hearing loss,

02:18.571 --> 02:20.239
headache, nausea.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.610
Embassy security is getting
into it with Bulgaria's SIA,

02:24.611 --> 02:26.278
but to be clear, we still don't know

02:26.279 --> 02:28.914
whether this was an attack,
or something else.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.883
- Like what?
- (DOOR OPENS)

02:30.884 --> 02:32.784
- Ephraim Ware, sir.
- DALTON: Get him in here.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.052
It's the Russians, isn't it?

02:34.053 --> 02:36.788
Actually, sir, yes,
it looks like it is.

02:36.789 --> 02:40.592
SIA is reporting that just
prior to the incident,

02:40.593 --> 02:42.628
three men broke into
an office building

02:42.629 --> 02:44.830
with direct line of
sight to our embassy.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.231
RUSSELL: Which is what you'd need

02:46.232 --> 02:48.433
for a sonic weapon, I presume.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.701
Facial recognition identified

02:49.702 --> 02:51.870
one of the men as Yuri Sturble,

02:51.871 --> 02:53.272
a Russian national.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.507
So much for "something else."

02:55.508 --> 02:56.842
Where are these men now?

02:56.843 --> 02:58.410
Unknown. But we're working

02:58.411 --> 03:00.245
with the Bulgarians to track them.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.713
It's practically an act of war.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.815
RUSSELL: Top Russian
brass certainly grumbled

03:03.816 --> 03:05.784
after we thwarted their
invasion in Emona,

03:05.785 --> 03:08.253
then added that new
wing onto the embassy

03:08.254 --> 03:09.454
as a victory lap, but I-I...

03:09.455 --> 03:10.656
Now they're hitting back.

03:10.657 --> 03:11.990

Activities Division

03:11.991 --> 03:14.426
in charge of the investigation.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.528
Dr. McCord is already being briefed.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.898
Fine, but I want the Pentagon
working on countermeasures now.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.900
Well, I suppose we should go and greet

03:21.901 --> 03:23.635
Prime Minister Soeda and smile

03:23.636 --> 03:26.238
like we're not careening
toward the abyss.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.906
Lydia wouldn't have it any other way.

03:30.075 --> 03:31.766
You look quite fetching,
by the way, Bess.

03:31.767 --> 03:32.922
Oh.

our embassy in Bulgaria?

03:48.127 --> 03:49.294
Was it Russia?

03:49.295 --> 03:51.229
I will tell you this:

03:51.230 --> 03:52.397
if we confirm

03:52.398 --> 03:54.700
that Russia is behind it,

03:54.701 --> 03:57.669
they are going to feel the
overwhelming force and ferocity

Thanks, everyone.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.650
Mr. President, I have to ask,

04:11.651 --> 04:14.252
what did you have in mind
with that statement?

04:14.253 --> 04:16.053
We're putting the Russians on notice.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.956
It's called leading from strength.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.690
Okay. And did you vet it

with the secretary of defense
or anyone on the NSC?

Excuse me?

Mr. President, I-I...

04:33.339 --> 04:35.941

Understood.

05:43.270 --> 05:45.238
And where are we on the situation?

05:45.239 --> 05:47.707
I have set up an emergency call
with Foreign Minister Avdonin.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.743
Who is standing by to teach
us an advanced course

05:49.744 --> 05:50.810
in Russian expletives,

05:50.811 --> 05:53.413
if his preliminary e-mail
is any indication.

05:53.414 --> 05:55.915
I saw it. Some of the phrases
were pretty imaginative.

05:55.916 --> 05:57.250
- Yeah.
- Ma'am, I hate to ask,

05:57.251 --> 05:59.619
but what's going on
with the president?

05:59.620 --> 06:04.824
Look, let's just focus on
containing the damage.

06:04.825 --> 06:05.859
- Okay?
- Okay, ma'am.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.860
Yes, ma'am.

06:08.762 --> 06:11.197
I suppose the challenge
in this call with Avdonin

06:11.198 --> 06:13.800
is to walk the delicate line

06:13.801 --> 06:15.869
of not undermining the
president's position

06:15.870 --> 06:18.438
while assuring Russia there
are no immediate plans

06:18.439 --> 06:23.109
to respond to the Sofia
situation with force.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.345
Piece of cake.

06:25.346 --> 06:27.847
No immediate plans? Really?

06:27.848 --> 06:30.250
Well, that just makes it
all better, doesn't it?

06:30.251 --> 06:31.584
Minister Avdonin...

06:31.585 --> 06:34.554
I have been in President
Salnikov's office

06:34.555 --> 06:37.524
for the last hour, and trust me,

06:37.525 --> 06:38.792
he's not happy.

06:38.793 --> 06:40.627
He makes me look like the picture

06:40.628 --> 06:42.562
- of peace and solitude.
- And that's why

06:42.563 --> 06:44.397
you and I need to tamp things down.

06:44.398 --> 06:45.532
Tamp?

06:45.533 --> 06:46.766
Your president is the only one

06:46.767 --> 06:49.969
who needs to tamp, Madam Secretary.

06:49.970 --> 06:52.839
In fact, he should apologize publicly

06:52.840 --> 06:56.910
for his spectacularly
over-the-top, barbaric,

06:56.911 --> 07:01.281
asinine, outrageous threat
against the Russian people.

07:01.282 --> 07:04.684
Why don't you and I focus
on what we can actually do?

07:04.685 --> 07:06.619
I can't wait to hear
what you have in mind.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.087
You say you didn't attack us.

07:08.088 --> 07:11.391
We know for a fact that
one of your citizens

07:11.392 --> 07:14.894
was seen in position to strike
our embassy before the incident.

07:14.895 --> 07:16.129
Let us talk to him.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.230
That's your idea

07:17.231 --> 07:19.866
of something we can actually do?

07:19.867 --> 07:23.469
If it wasn't an attack, then you
have nothing to worry about.

07:23.470 --> 07:25.104
Us, worry?

07:25.105 --> 07:26.172
President Dalton

07:26.173 --> 07:30.376
threatened Russia on the world stage.

07:30.377 --> 07:31.911
No. You worry.

07:31.912 --> 07:36.281
We will not let this
affront go unanswered.

07:38.384 --> 07:40.320

- Oh.
- You're still up?

07:48.495 --> 07:49.796
Yeah, I was, I was
trying to get a jump

07:49.797 --> 07:51.331
on this intel on the ground in Sofia.

07:51.332 --> 07:53.600
- Any luck?
- Well, it's mostly conflicting reports

07:53.601 --> 07:55.535
and speculation at this point.

07:55.536 --> 07:57.437
How did things go with Avdonin?

07:57.438 --> 08:00.607
Not in a good place yet.

08:00.608 --> 08:02.842
What on earth possessed Conrad?

08:02.843 --> 08:04.377
It's so unlike him.

08:04.378 --> 08:05.979
I tried calling Lydia,

08:05.980 --> 08:07.447
but she didn't pick up.

08:07.448 --> 08:09.115
Maybe something with Harrison.

08:09.116 --> 08:11.150
That usually sets him off.

08:11.151 --> 08:14.220
I'm hoping he turns
on the charm tomorrow

08:14.221 --> 08:16.189
and buys it all back, and then

08:16.190 --> 08:21.461
this will have just been a very
strange, very cold evening.

08:21.462 --> 08:23.630
And right now, I am going

08:23.631 --> 08:26.266

It's just a broken pipe, calm down.

Really? You were the first
one to say "giant sinkhole."

08:52.493 --> 08:53.526
That could still happen.

08:53.527 --> 08:55.395
Is there something that we can do?

08:55.396 --> 08:57.697
I don't even know what's down here.

08:57.698 --> 09:00.266
Look at that box.

09:00.267 --> 09:03.202
Ugh. Got even worse news.

09:03.203 --> 09:04.938
- There goes your hot bath.
- What?

09:04.939 --> 09:06.539
I had to turn off the main.

09:06.540 --> 09:09.142
I hate this night.

09:09.143 --> 09:10.810
Let's go, come on.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.779
- Isn't there supposed to be a drain?
- Call the plumber. Plumber, plumber.

09:12.780 --> 09:16.316
When it gets this cold,
you got to run the water through

09:16.317 --> 09:17.817
as a preventative measure.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.218
Why?

09:19.219 --> 09:22.522
'Cause if you let it just sit
there, it freezes, expands.

09:22.523 --> 09:24.057
The pipes burst.

09:24.058 --> 09:26.359
Did you run the water through?

09:26.360 --> 09:27.530
Let me answer that for you,

09:27.531 --> 09:30.366
because I wouldn't be here if
you ran the water through.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.468
We ran the water in the morning.
We were only gone for the day.

09:32.469 --> 09:34.136
Yeah, well, that's all it
takes in weather like this.

09:34.137 --> 09:35.337
ELIZABETH: Well, I was about to

09:35.338 --> 09:37.672
draw a bath when it happened...

09:39.308 --> 09:41.677
The point here isn't to be right.

09:41.678 --> 09:44.413
The point here is to learn
from your mistakes.

09:44.414 --> 09:46.015
Well, thank you, Earl.

09:46.016 --> 09:48.918
This is a terrific
opportunity for growth.

09:48.919 --> 09:50.186
ELIZABETH: Ooh, hey.

09:50.187 --> 09:51.287
Looks like you guys

09:51.288 --> 09:52.855
found the fishing gear.

09:52.856 --> 09:54.590
Yeah, it was on the top shelf.

09:54.591 --> 09:56.058
Most of the boxes look like this.

09:56.059 --> 09:58.294
- Ugh.
- JASON: Or worse.

09:58.295 --> 10:00.529
We're setting up Operation
Dig Through in the kitchen.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.732
I-It's probably just old linens

10:02.733 --> 10:04.734
and stuff we don't care about, right?

10:04.735 --> 10:06.869
We'll see.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.071
Pretty expensive lesson, am I right?

10:09.072 --> 10:11.073
Wow.

10:11.074 --> 10:12.241
Ooh.

10:12.242 --> 10:15.444
See, it's easy to forget
about the foundations.

10:15.445 --> 10:16.645
You live in the bright,

10:16.646 --> 10:19.381
shiny spaces where everything works,

10:19.382 --> 10:22.985
but you let yourselves forget
about structural integrity.

10:22.986 --> 10:24.987
The sanctity of the pipes.

10:24.988 --> 10:28.224
Everything inside the walls
that makes it all work.

10:28.225 --> 10:31.460
Houses are built from the ground up.

10:31.461 --> 10:34.362
Remember that.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.236
Okay. I consider myself

10:40.237 --> 10:42.271
a relatively progressive,
enlightened man...

10:42.272 --> 10:44.006
You want to punch Earl.

10:44.007 --> 10:46.008
- So much.
- I know.

10:46.009 --> 10:48.711
- I get it.
- (PHONE RINGING)

10:48.712 --> 10:49.712
Okay.

10:49.713 --> 10:51.547
Hello.

10:51.548 --> 10:54.884
Russia just announced an $8
billion arms sale to Iran.

10:54.885 --> 10:56.752
Okay. Not too bad, considering.

10:56.753 --> 10:57.987
The release says it's

10:57.988 --> 11:00.422
to "counteract imperialist
Western influence."

11:00.423 --> 11:02.858
Has a sort of autocratic charm.

11:02.859 --> 11:06.061
They know it's not in their
interest to amp up aggressions.

11:06.062 --> 11:08.164
So it's a measured response.

11:08.165 --> 11:09.165
Then you should tell POTUS that.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.866
He wants you in the Situation Room.

11:14.303 --> 11:15.538
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

11:15.539 --> 11:17.506
Morning. You got something?

11:17.507 --> 11:18.808
We lost Yuri Sturble.

11:18.809 --> 11:20.376
He was over the Romanian
border less than two hours

11:20.377 --> 11:22.545
after the incident,
along with the two other men.

11:22.546 --> 11:23.946
It's all on border security footage.

11:23.947 --> 11:26.448
SRI is into it, but we're not hopeful.

11:26.449 --> 11:27.616
What about our foreign
service officers?

11:27.617 --> 11:28.617
MOLLY: Still being
treated for hearing loss

11:28.618 --> 11:30.452
and severe headaches.

11:30.453 --> 11:32.388
Some are having prolonged bouts
of dizziness and nausea.

11:32.389 --> 11:34.423
And that's consistent
with a sonic attack?

11:34.424 --> 11:37.259
Still, the case against Russia
is completely circumstantial.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.896
MOLLY: But the president
must know something, right?

11:40.897 --> 11:44.300
"Overwhelming force and veracity
of our military might".

11:44.301 --> 11:45.701
He must have some broader strategy.

11:45.702 --> 11:47.937
The president is counting
on us to provide clarity.

11:47.938 --> 11:49.605
Let's broaden all our inquiries.

11:49.606 --> 11:51.372
Okay.

11:53.108 --> 11:55.511
What the hell took you so long?

11:55.512 --> 11:57.046
Excuse me?

11:57.047 --> 11:59.014
Sorry. The stress of wrangling

11:59.015 --> 12:00.683
the most powerful man on Earth.

12:00.684 --> 12:01.984
What now?

12:01.985 --> 12:03.886
He's talking about shooting down

12:03.887 --> 12:06.255
- Russian military satellites.
- What?!

12:06.256 --> 12:08.190
At least he wants to hear from the NSC

12:08.191 --> 12:09.458
before giving the order.

12:09.459 --> 12:11.093
Oh, he'll hear from us.

12:11.094 --> 12:13.596
Any word from Harrison?

12:13.597 --> 12:14.663
Yeah, I just talked to him.

12:14.664 --> 12:16.932
Chewed my ear off about his blog,

12:16.933 --> 12:19.768
the whole juicing versus regular
juicing or whatever the hell.

12:19.769 --> 12:21.036
He's not the problem.

12:21.037 --> 12:22.037
What about Lydia?

12:22.038 --> 12:23.405
She's not returning my calls.

12:23.406 --> 12:25.474
Yeah, she's been dodging me, too.

12:25.475 --> 12:27.209
What is happening?

12:27.210 --> 12:29.211
HILL: I suggest either
targeted economic sanctions

12:29.212 --> 12:31.013
or the expulsion of diplomats.

12:31.014 --> 12:33.449
Same old dance.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.084
It's a proportional response, sir.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.919
That's exactly my problem with it.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.420
I agree with Ellen, sir.

12:38.421 --> 12:40.789
We're talking about a
response to an arms deal.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.691
Do you really have any doubt
about the sonic attack

12:42.692 --> 12:44.260
- on our embassy?
- Yes.

12:44.261 --> 12:45.895
It's still being investigated.

12:45.896 --> 12:48.731
That leaves you, Gordon.

12:48.732 --> 12:50.766
I'm with Ellen and the
secretary on this, sir.

12:50.767 --> 12:52.301
Although I might also advocate

12:52.302 --> 12:53.469
for the seizure of Russian property

12:53.470 --> 12:55.504
- on our soil.
- None of which will teach

12:55.505 --> 12:56.939
Salnikov and his comrades a lesson.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.707
How many

12:58.708 --> 13:01.043
Oko missile detection
satellites do they have?

13:01.044 --> 13:03.245
Five, sir.

13:03.246 --> 13:04.747
Take 'em out.

13:04.748 --> 13:06.849
All of 'em. Thanks, everyone.

13:06.850 --> 13:09.249
Conrad, that's a massive
escalation without

13:09.250 --> 13:11.910
- We're done here, Bess.
- definitive proof that Russia is beh...

13:13.188 --> 13:15.791
Mr. President, I strongly
advise against this order.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.326
I already heard your recommendation.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.528
Sir, I cannot in good
conscience carry it out.

13:19.529 --> 13:21.664
What makes you think I give a crap

13:21.665 --> 13:23.198
about your conscience, Gordon?

13:23.199 --> 13:26.068
I will not obey the order, sir.

13:26.069 --> 13:27.703
Then I'll expect your resignation.

13:27.704 --> 13:29.705
- Mr. President.
- Sir.

13:29.706 --> 13:31.774
- Yes, sir.
- In the meantime,

13:31.775 --> 13:33.208
you're fired.

13:33.209 --> 13:36.612
Deputy Secretary Holland,
congratulations.

13:36.613 --> 13:38.914
You are now acting
secretary of defense.

13:38.915 --> 13:40.549
Do you understand my order?

13:40.550 --> 13:43.551
Yes, Mr. President.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.860
Mr. President, I have to tell you,

13:51.861 --> 13:53.295
I, uh, I agree with Gordon.

13:53.296 --> 13:54.591
Noted. I think we should...

13:54.592 --> 13:56.927
Conrad, can we just talk about this?

13:56.928 --> 13:58.495
We just did.

13:58.496 --> 14:00.764
But striking Russia when we...

14:00.765 --> 14:03.400
- I'm standing up to them.
- No, thi-this isn't like you,

14:03.401 --> 14:06.436
ignoring your entire
National Security Council,

14:06.437 --> 14:08.700
escalating before we
have all the facts.

14:08.701 --> 14:09.697
Enough.

14:09.698 --> 14:11.141
This is our policy now.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.443
You and the rest of the
NSC need to get on board

14:13.444 --> 14:14.578
or get out of the way.

14:14.579 --> 14:16.780
What's going on?

14:16.781 --> 14:19.182
You have always insisted
that I speak my mind.

14:19.183 --> 14:21.451
Well, I might have to
rethink that policy, too.

14:21.452 --> 14:23.353
Conrad.

14:23.354 --> 14:26.188
Let's stick with Mr. President, hmm?

14:28.000 --> 14:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:35.236 --> 14:37.671
Dr. McCord, we have Agent
Montgomery on SVTC.

14:37.672 --> 14:39.072
You're gonna want to hear this.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.977
HENRY: Nicole, I understand
you found a recording.

14:42.978 --> 14:45.446
Yeah, it matches the timing exactly.

14:45.447 --> 14:47.872
And several FSOs confirmed
it's what they heard.

14:47.873 --> 14:49.908
You buried the lede.
Tell him how you got it.

14:49.909 --> 14:54.279
The, uh, embassy has a Diplotots
day care on the first floor

14:54.280 --> 14:56.648
with a nanny cam
recording all the fun.

14:56.649 --> 14:59.484
I've always questioned the
civil rights implications

14:59.485 --> 15:00.719
of those things, but I'll take it.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.753
Okay, let's hear it.

15:01.754 --> 15:04.755
(HIGH-PITCHED FREQUENCY WHINES)

15:07.359 --> 15:08.994
HENRY: It's pretty faint.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.929
We're sending it over to the FBI lab.

15:10.930 --> 15:13.198
If it's a sonic weapon, they'll know.

15:13.199 --> 15:14.199
Maybe they can also

15:14.200 --> 15:16.067
reverse-engineer the signal.

15:16.068 --> 15:18.370
That way we'll know if it's
Russian tech or something else.

15:18.371 --> 15:20.471
I'll make the request.

15:34.119 --> 15:36.787
Are they here?

15:40.158 --> 15:41.526
Does anyone know you're here?

15:41.527 --> 15:43.962
Uh, no. I mean, my husband, but...

15:43.963 --> 15:46.564
I didn't tell my wife.

15:46.565 --> 15:49.668
If this goes sideways, I don't
want her to have to lawyer up.

15:49.669 --> 15:51.469
I'd rather be eaten by
lawyers than do this,

15:51.470 --> 15:54.305
but we should get started.

15:54.306 --> 15:57.342
The president, who I would normally

15:57.343 --> 15:59.144
walk through the gates of hell for,

15:59.145 --> 16:01.713
has issued an order that,
for the good of the country,

16:01.714 --> 16:03.848
cannot be executed.

16:03.849 --> 16:06.785
We are the firewall between that order

16:06.786 --> 16:08.987
and the nightmare it could unleash.

16:08.988 --> 16:10.088
Inspiring words, Russell,

16:10.089 --> 16:11.756
but I'm the one who's on the hook.

16:11.757 --> 16:13.458
A pact among all of us.

16:13.459 --> 16:15.393
- A suicide pact.
- HILL: Call it whatever you want.

16:15.394 --> 16:17.028
We all threaten to quit
if it comes to that,

16:17.029 --> 16:18.029
except Gordon.

16:18.030 --> 16:20.432
First unto the breach.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.000
Look, even in his current state,

16:22.001 --> 16:23.301
I believe the president would realize

16:23.302 --> 16:24.636
he couldn't afford to lose

16:24.637 --> 16:27.739
all four of us, especially
with news not breaking yet

16:27.740 --> 16:28.807
of Gordon's firing.

16:28.808 --> 16:30.475
All of that coming out at once

16:30.476 --> 16:32.911
would create a political firestorm,

16:32.912 --> 16:35.980
could lead to a constitutional
crisis, God knows what.

16:35.981 --> 16:37.215
Maybe I should just refuse
the order outright,

16:37.216 --> 16:38.216
like Gordon.

16:38.217 --> 16:39.818
And take our chances on Sorenson?

16:39.819 --> 16:41.519
You took your chances on me.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.321
I tried to shock POTUS
into changing his mind.

16:43.322 --> 16:45.156
Now we're in a different situation.

16:45.157 --> 16:47.158
I see. So, you're honorable
and I'm the traitor?

16:47.159 --> 16:49.160
Oh, please. Come on.

16:49.161 --> 16:50.195
Look, I'm sorry.

16:50.196 --> 16:52.630
I just... I-I never considered

16:52.631 --> 16:54.833
shirking an order from
the president before.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.434
You know, I already
have stomach issues.

16:56.435 --> 16:59.237
I know it's a lot to ask, Bob,

16:59.238 --> 17:00.839
but what's the alternative?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.173
To follow orders.

17:02.174 --> 17:04.843
You know, maybe POTUS is right.

17:04.844 --> 17:06.544
Maybe we need to push
back on Salnikov.

17:06.545 --> 17:07.979
You really want to risk
striking a country

17:07.980 --> 17:09.513
with 1,500 nuclear-armed ICBMs

17:09.515 --> 17:12.183
on a hair-trigger?

17:12.184 --> 17:14.118
Do you really want to risk
a constitutional crisis?

17:14.119 --> 17:18.923
Look, there is a reason
the chain of command

17:18.924 --> 17:21.025
begins with civilians.

17:21.026 --> 17:23.428
And it follows the
Constitution's empowerment

17:23.429 --> 17:25.763
of civilians over the military

17:25.765 --> 17:31.336
because we exercise judgment
before just following orders.

17:31.337 --> 17:33.004
I've read the Constitution,
Madam Secretary.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.273
And it doesn't spell out any of that,

17:35.274 --> 17:36.674
but it does say that the president

17:36.675 --> 17:37.642
is the commander in chief.

17:37.643 --> 17:39.511
Okay, okay.

17:39.512 --> 17:42.213
How long do we have

17:42.214 --> 17:44.082
until our missiles are
ready to be fired?

17:44.083 --> 17:45.150
BECKER: Our sea-based interceptors

17:45.151 --> 17:47.018
have to move to AOR for launch,

17:47.019 --> 17:48.620
and that'll take at
least another 15 hours.

17:48.621 --> 17:50.722
Then STRATCOM has to
calibrate targeting.

17:50.723 --> 17:53.458
- We have 24 hours.
- RUSSELL: Good.

17:53.459 --> 17:55.593
Maybe by then we'll have something

17:55.594 --> 17:57.061
that'll make POTUS reconsider.

17:57.062 --> 17:58.329
ELIZABETH: If not,

17:58.330 --> 18:00.765
I mean, is there any way
to slow-play the order?

18:00.766 --> 18:03.168
Hold it up somehow?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.569
You could jam up STRATCOM.

18:04.570 --> 18:07.572
Order a review of the
launch trajectory.

18:07.573 --> 18:08.973
This is a coup.

18:08.974 --> 18:10.809
What we're talking about is a coup.

18:10.810 --> 18:14.212
RUSSELL: I realize we're
painting outside the lines here,

18:14.213 --> 18:16.181
but the framers never contemplated

18:16.182 --> 18:19.083
that an elected president
wouldn't be reasonable.

18:19.084 --> 18:20.185
We're doing the best we can.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.519
What about the 25th Amendment?

18:21.520 --> 18:23.454
- We're not there yet.
- Well, what are we waiting for?

18:23.455 --> 18:25.223
- The clock to run out.
- ROBERT: And then what?

18:25.224 --> 18:26.391
Then we'll do what we have to.

18:26.392 --> 18:28.359
All right? Just...

18:28.360 --> 18:32.897
let's just see what
the next day brings.

18:32.898 --> 18:35.366
ROBERT: Okay.

18:35.367 --> 18:37.901
But I'm not making any promises.

18:40.772 --> 18:42.640
(GROANS)

18:42.641 --> 18:44.209
Gross.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.712
How is Operation Dig Through going?

18:47.713 --> 18:50.114
Oh, you know, it's your basic, weird,

18:50.115 --> 18:52.584
soggy journey through the past.

18:52.585 --> 18:54.419
Oh, did anything survive?

18:54.420 --> 18:56.354
Uh, yeah. It's mostly junk, though.

18:56.355 --> 18:58.356
It's baby stuff that Mom was saving.

18:58.357 --> 19:00.258
It's not junk to her.

19:00.259 --> 19:01.659
Sentimentality is the superstructure

19:01.660 --> 19:03.194
erected upon brutality.

19:03.195 --> 19:04.696
Way to plagiarize Jung.

19:04.697 --> 19:07.531
Uh, it's still true.

19:08.233 --> 19:10.768
- Oh, no.
- (GASPS)

19:10.769 --> 19:12.971
Looks like your formative
years took a hit.

19:12.972 --> 19:16.074
- (LAUGHING): Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

19:16.075 --> 19:18.243
Oh, you can kind of make
out some of the stuff.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.143
Here, let's see.

19:19.144 --> 19:20.879
"Stevie spits up".

19:20.880 --> 19:22.747
No. "Sits up". Sits up.

19:22.748 --> 19:24.649
(LAUGHS) "Stevie..".

19:24.650 --> 19:28.219
- What is that?
- Uh... "Sees herself in mirror."

19:28.220 --> 19:30.955
- And never stops.
- Hey.

19:30.956 --> 19:32.457
ALISON: My book is
pretty messed up, too.

19:32.458 --> 19:36.060
And, wow, there's a
lot of blank pages.

19:36.061 --> 19:39.497
And after my first step there's
nothing until preschool.

19:39.498 --> 19:42.567
(GASPS) Jason's looks in
pretty good condition.

19:42.568 --> 19:46.604
Uh, yeah, because it was never
taken out of its shrink-wrap.

19:46.605 --> 19:48.238
ALISON: That can't be true.

19:59.150 --> 20:01.185
Great.

20:01.186 --> 20:04.155
Great. I'll just...

20:04.156 --> 20:07.125
let the documented
ones finish up here.

20:07.126 --> 20:09.761
What, so now sentimentality is okay?

20:09.762 --> 20:10.929
JASON: No.

20:10.930 --> 20:12.030
That's not nostalgia, that's history.

20:12.031 --> 20:13.064
And apparently mine isn't important.

20:13.065 --> 20:15.633
Jace.

20:15.634 --> 20:18.336
- (PIANO PLAYING)
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:18.337 --> 20:19.936
Thank you, Mrs. Dalton.

20:25.777 --> 20:28.279
Elizabeth, what a nice surprise.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.590
I didn't see your name
on the guest list.

20:30.591 --> 20:31.648
It isn't.

20:31.649 --> 20:33.757
I'm not allowed to participate
in political fund-raisers,

20:33.758 --> 20:36.460
even though I'm a fan
of Senator Giminski.

20:36.461 --> 20:38.596
No, I just am shamelessly crashing

20:38.597 --> 20:39.930
to get a moment with you.

20:39.931 --> 20:43.133
You know this is putting
me in an awkward position.

20:43.134 --> 20:45.835
You know I wouldn't if it
weren't extremely important.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.441
So, you want to know what's
going on with Conrad

20:50.442 --> 20:53.043
because he's finally reached
his limit with an adversary

20:53.044 --> 20:55.813
who has behaved
consistently abominably

20:55.814 --> 20:57.047
under his administration.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.183
Conrad's behavior is out of character.

20:59.184 --> 21:01.852
It is extreme.

21:01.853 --> 21:04.255
You know him almost as well as I do.

21:04.256 --> 21:06.190
It takes a lot to get him angry,

21:06.191 --> 21:09.026
but once he gets there...

21:09.027 --> 21:11.328
everyone needs to take a step back.

21:11.329 --> 21:13.764
Lydia, Russia isn't going
to take a step back.

21:13.765 --> 21:16.741
And the Conrad I've known

21:16.742 --> 21:18.469
for over two decades

21:18.470 --> 21:21.205
would be well aware of that.

21:21.206 --> 21:23.407
- You need to talk to him.
- I've tried.

21:23.408 --> 21:27.111
That's why I'm here.

21:27.112 --> 21:30.047
I need to know if you're aware
of any changes in his health.

21:30.048 --> 21:32.149
He has a physical quarterly.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.585
There's never anything wrong.

21:34.586 --> 21:35.619
I think your worrying

21:35.620 --> 21:38.122
is out of proportion.

21:38.123 --> 21:39.523
At the risk of breaching protocol,

21:39.524 --> 21:43.327
I am gonna tell you something.

21:43.328 --> 21:45.696
Conrad has ordered a missile strike

21:45.697 --> 21:46.897
against Russia's satellite system.

21:46.898 --> 21:49.667
It could easily lead to war.

21:49.668 --> 21:53.003
Every member of the NSC

21:53.004 --> 21:55.039
has advised against it.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.774
Gordon Becker was so opposed,

21:56.775 --> 21:58.942
he refused a direct order.

21:58.943 --> 22:03.113
So Conrad fired him,
and he wants to do it anyway.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.916
You tell me,

22:05.917 --> 22:10.020
does that sound like the man we know?

22:10.021 --> 22:12.656
(HIGH-PITCHED FREQUENCY
WHINES OVER HEADPHONES)

22:12.657 --> 22:13.923
Hey.

22:15.726 --> 22:17.461
Should I even ask how your day was?

22:17.462 --> 22:18.462
Well...

22:18.463 --> 22:23.466
the Constitution is
still intact for now.

22:25.402 --> 22:26.937
(SIGHS) You?

22:26.938 --> 22:28.405
Oh, I was hoping these FBI analysts

22:28.406 --> 22:30.174
could make some progress overnight,

22:30.175 --> 22:32.476
so we could get some answers
about what happened in Sofia.

22:32.477 --> 22:37.281
Maybe even something that'll
help talk Conrad off the ledge.

22:37.282 --> 22:40.484
He hasn't backed off
this satellite strike?

22:40.485 --> 22:44.388
I don't know how long we can
keep the acting SecDef in line.

22:44.389 --> 22:46.790
And I don't blame him for wavering.

22:46.791 --> 22:48.959
We're asking him to do
something unprecedented.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.096
Well, at the end of the day,
I guess the best we can hope for

22:52.097 --> 22:55.332
is that he follows his conscience.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.700
Even if his conscience

22:56.701 --> 23:00.904
is telling him to defy a
direct order from POTUS?

23:00.905 --> 23:02.940
I think reptile brain wins that one.

23:02.941 --> 23:06.276
We have the best system of government

23:06.277 --> 23:08.045
the world has ever seen,

23:08.046 --> 23:12.683
but it's only as good as
the people in charge.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.486
Gosh, that's reassuring.

23:15.487 --> 23:16.453
Sorry.

23:16.454 --> 23:20.089
- I'm no Earl.
- (LAUGHS)

23:22.326 --> 23:24.061
Morning, sir.

23:24.062 --> 23:25.162
Morning, Mr. President, Russell.

23:25.163 --> 23:27.965
Let's hear it. What did you find?

23:27.966 --> 23:30.501
The FBI lab has determined
that the sonic event

23:30.502 --> 23:32.903
at our embassy in Sofia
was not an attack.

23:32.904 --> 23:34.471
Then what the hell was it?

23:34.472 --> 23:36.507
There's high confidence
that the sound was caused

23:36.508 --> 23:37.641
by a Russian listening device

23:37.642 --> 23:39.877
pointed at the embassy that interacted

23:39.878 --> 23:43.180
with the fourth floor's
encryption frequency.

23:43.181 --> 23:45.716
- So their frequencies crossed?
- Basically.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.452
Creating a beating effect.

23:48.453 --> 23:50.020
So how does that account
for our people's injuries?

23:50.021 --> 23:51.755
WARE: Well, the noise would produce

23:51.756 --> 23:53.924
headaches and temporary hearing loss.

23:53.925 --> 23:55.592
The bottom line is,

23:55.593 --> 23:57.261
there was no attack,

23:57.262 --> 23:59.062
just a thwarted spying effort.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.664
So we're supposed to believe
it's just a coincidence

24:00.665 --> 24:02.733
that when the Russians
spied on us, suddenly,

24:02.734 --> 24:04.168
our FSOs became ill?

24:04.169 --> 24:05.602
That's right.

24:05.603 --> 24:09.339
All our top FBI sound
engineers concur.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.375
There was no Russian attack.

24:11.376 --> 24:13.043
I heard you the first time.

24:13.044 --> 24:16.013
Thank you, Henry. Ephraim.

24:16.014 --> 24:17.714
Yes, sir.

24:17.715 --> 24:19.382
You bet, Mr. President.

24:23.153 --> 24:24.421
So that changes things.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.857
- Like what?
- The satellite attack.

24:26.858 --> 24:29.393
- It's unwarranted now that we...
- No.

24:29.394 --> 24:31.295
We are not backing down now.

24:31.296 --> 24:33.664
It's not backing down if
Russia never attacked us

24:33.665 --> 24:36.133
- in the first place, sir.
- So you're okay with them spying on us?

24:36.134 --> 24:38.469
I seem to remember you running

24:38.470 --> 24:40.904
the biggest spy agency on Earth.

24:40.905 --> 24:43.307
No one ever declared war on us

24:43.308 --> 24:44.875
when they found out
we were listening in.

24:44.876 --> 24:47.077
Because they knew what the
consequences would be.

24:47.078 --> 24:49.513
Sir, I think the secretary

24:49.514 --> 24:52.316
is just pointing out that
given what we now know...

24:52.317 --> 24:53.317
I know exactly

24:53.318 --> 24:54.284
what she's doing, Russell.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.752
And you, too. And I'm sick of it.

24:55.753 --> 24:57.721
I'm the damn president!

24:57.722 --> 24:59.423
And my authority will
not be questioned,

24:59.424 --> 25:01.958
do you understand?

25:03.894 --> 25:06.330
Conrad, can you hear yourself?

25:06.331 --> 25:08.398
What's next, Russell?

25:08.399 --> 25:10.534
Uh...

25:10.535 --> 25:12.836
Meeting with the House
Ways and Means Committee

25:12.837 --> 25:16.707
in the Roosevelt Room.

25:16.708 --> 25:18.841
Mr. President, you're not well.

25:20.511 --> 25:22.546
Really?

25:22.547 --> 25:24.648
Hmm.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.918
And what exactly do you
think is wrong with me?

25:27.919 --> 25:29.920
I don't know,

25:29.921 --> 25:31.889
but you need to be
examined by a doctor

25:31.890 --> 25:33.757
to find out.

25:33.758 --> 25:35.425
You've been talking to
Lydia, haven't you?

25:35.426 --> 25:38.295
Yes. I'm concerned about you.

25:38.296 --> 25:40.831
We all are, sir.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.599
I am trying to show

25:42.600 --> 25:46.370
Salnikov and Russia that I
will not be trifled with.

25:46.371 --> 25:49.473
That when I make a threat,
I carry through on it.

25:49.474 --> 25:52.409
And I don't give a crap
if you or anyone agrees

25:52.410 --> 25:54.511
because I am the most
powerful man on Earth,

25:54.512 --> 25:57.380
and no one is going to stop me!

26:10.674 --> 26:12.975
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

26:18.315 --> 26:20.217
Okay.

26:20.218 --> 26:23.687
We all know why we're here.

26:23.688 --> 26:26.724
Conrad Dalton...

26:26.725 --> 26:30.360
is the finest public
servant I've ever known.

26:30.361 --> 26:34.932
He's thoughtful,
compassionate, courageous,

26:34.933 --> 26:37.434
the best damn listener
in a town full of people

26:37.435 --> 26:38.669
who love to hear themselves talk.

26:38.670 --> 26:41.605
In short, he's a good man

26:41.606 --> 26:43.540
and a patriot.

26:43.541 --> 26:48.345
And I, like many of you in this
room, owe my career to him.

26:48.346 --> 26:50.781
But the man who publicly
threatened to unleash

26:50.782 --> 26:54.685
the overwhelming force of
America's military might,

26:54.686 --> 26:59.123
and stands by his order to
strike Russia's satellites,

26:59.124 --> 27:01.058
despite conclusive evidence

27:01.059 --> 27:04.128
that the Russians did not attack us,

27:04.129 --> 27:06.096
is not the same man.

27:06.097 --> 27:08.632
Something's wrong.

27:08.633 --> 27:12.836
Without a diagnosis,
we don't know what.

27:12.837 --> 27:16.340
But I think the Conrad
Dalton we all know

27:16.341 --> 27:17.674
would want us to stop him.

27:17.675 --> 27:20.077
I've talked to White House Counsel

27:20.078 --> 27:22.513
and the attorney general,

27:22.514 --> 27:24.348
and though there is a "fog of la".

27:24.349 --> 27:28.118
Surrounding Section 4
of the 25th Amendment,

27:28.119 --> 27:31.755
because it's never been
invoked, they assured me

27:31.756 --> 27:35.325
that if the heads of the
executive departments

27:35.326 --> 27:36.994
plus the vice president

27:36.995 --> 27:39.363
vote by simple majority,

27:39.364 --> 27:42.800
the president will be
removed from office,

27:42.801 --> 27:44.468
and Vice President Hurst

27:44.469 --> 27:47.337
will become the acting president.

27:47.338 --> 27:52.009
Acting secretaries can't vote,
so that eliminates Bob here.

27:52.010 --> 27:56.446
Leaving 15 of you,

27:56.447 --> 27:57.881
including the VP.

27:57.882 --> 28:01.418
If ever there were a time
to set aside politics

28:01.419 --> 28:06.190
and do what's best for the country,

28:06.191 --> 28:07.757
this is it.

28:10.060 --> 28:12.462
Russell has asked me to provide
some context for this.

28:12.463 --> 28:15.632
Um, in two hours,

28:15.633 --> 28:19.503
President Dalton will
enter the Situation Room,

28:19.504 --> 28:21.839
and I will execute his order.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.040
Nine minutes later,

28:23.041 --> 28:26.143

28:48.499 --> 28:49.466

28:49.467 --> 28:50.901
I would just like to say that,

28:50.902 --> 28:54.371

explanation of the law,

28:54.372 --> 28:57.074

the Section 4 threshold yet.

29:03.781 --> 29:05.549
Due respect, Madam Vice President,

29:05.550 --> 29:07.551
but perhaps it's indiscreet
for you to weigh in

29:07.552 --> 29:10.654

an enormous vested interest

29:10.655 --> 29:12.689

- My interest

29:12.690 --> 29:15.392

time to hit the Russians.

29:25.904 --> 29:29.273

duly elected president.

29:29.274 --> 29:32.643
But even if the Russians are cowed,

29:32.644 --> 29:34.578
the president is still a wild card.

29:34.579 --> 29:36.780
And we will end up going

29:36.781 --> 29:39.716
from crisis to crisis,

29:39.717 --> 29:43.619
and eventually there'll be disaster.

38:15.248 --> 38:18.651
The frontal lobe is responsible
for executive functions:

38:18.652 --> 38:21.353
judgment, decision-making, inhibition.

38:21.354 --> 38:23.455
So, when it's stimulated,

38:23.456 --> 38:26.225
significant personality
change is common...

38:26.226 --> 38:29.228
along with excessive
displays of emotion.

38:29.229 --> 38:31.530
And removing the growth will reverse

38:31.531 --> 38:33.399
- all of that?
- Yep. In fact,

38:33.400 --> 38:35.601
the steroids I'm putting
him on will rapidly reduce

38:35.602 --> 38:37.603
the swelling and ease the pressure.

38:37.604 --> 38:40.738
He should improve
dramatically, even pre-op.

38:41.907 --> 38:44.475
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:50.115 --> 38:52.117
- Hey, you two.
- Hi, Lydia.

38:52.118 --> 38:54.053
We heard you were running
a little low on flowers.

38:54.054 --> 38:55.921
(LAUGHS) So we brought
some reinforcements.

38:55.922 --> 38:57.756
- They're beautiful. Thank you.
- Conrad.

38:57.757 --> 38:59.757
Bess.

39:01.994 --> 39:03.961
- Henry.
- Conrad.

39:05.130 --> 39:07.366
- Thank you for being here.
- ELIZABETH: Are you kidding?

39:07.367 --> 39:08.834
Chance to see something
as historic as this,

39:08.835 --> 39:10.302
you couldn't keep me
away with a stick.

39:10.303 --> 39:12.871
Listen, I have to apologize, Bess.

39:12.872 --> 39:15.240
- No, Conrad, you don't.
- (SIGHS)

39:15.241 --> 39:17.309
What I put you all through...

39:17.310 --> 39:18.644
I think you get a pass

39:18.645 --> 39:20.913
- for all of it.
- It wasn't you, it was the meningioma.

39:20.914 --> 39:21.947
Yeah.

39:21.948 --> 39:23.749
I told you you looked "fetching"

39:23.750 --> 39:26.118
- the night of the Japanese state dinner.
- (ELIZABETH LAUGHS)

39:26.119 --> 39:27.286
HENRY: Well, she did.

39:27.287 --> 39:30.556
It's fine hearing it from <i>you,</i> Henry.

39:30.557 --> 39:33.625
Crazy thing is...

39:33.626 --> 39:35.861
I don't think I ever felt freer

39:35.862 --> 39:37.763
or more sure of myself.

39:37.764 --> 39:39.431
How scary is that?

39:39.432 --> 39:41.300
I mean, real madman stuff.

39:41.301 --> 39:44.069
No sense at all that I
was out of my gourd.

39:44.070 --> 39:48.707
Well, it was Russell that we
were <i>really</i> worried about.

39:48.708 --> 39:52.510
You could practically
see the aneurysm.

39:53.712 --> 39:55.114
I...

39:55.115 --> 39:58.717
really did almost start World War III

39:58.718 --> 40:00.651
over a misunderstanding.

40:01.387 --> 40:03.355
LYDIA: Enough of the
self-flagellation,

40:03.356 --> 40:04.990
- darling, it's getting boring.
- Yeah.

40:04.991 --> 40:07.626
We need you to project
confidence tonight.

40:07.627 --> 40:09.795
- Hello. Lydia.
- Hi.

40:09.796 --> 40:11.930
How are you feeling, Mr. President?

40:11.931 --> 40:13.399
Surprisingly well, thanks.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.600
Madam President.

40:14.601 --> 40:16.502
That has a nice ring to it.

40:16.503 --> 40:18.537
But that's <i>Acting</i> President.

40:18.538 --> 40:21.006
- I'm just minding the store.
- Well, thanks for doing this, Teresa.

40:21.007 --> 40:24.176
I think it'll mean a
lot to the country.

40:24.177 --> 40:26.811
- So do I, sir.
- Well, it's time.

40:32.785 --> 40:35.921
You know, Bess, that was
quite a thing you all did,

40:35.922 --> 40:37.356
invoking Section 4.

40:37.357 --> 40:40.692
- Took guts.
- Well, it wasn't fun.

40:40.693 --> 40:43.494
Should I ask how you voted?

40:44.363 --> 40:47.732
The way you would have
wanted me to, sir.

40:50.269 --> 40:53.372
I've since been given steroids
to reduce the swelling

40:53.373 --> 40:56.809
and will be operated on
tomorrow to remove the tumor.

40:56.810 --> 41:00.379
During my recovery,
Acting President Teresa Hurst

41:00.380 --> 41:03.582
will continue to provide steady,
experienced leadership,

41:03.583 --> 41:06.752
like she always has during
her almost 30 years

41:06.753 --> 41:08.687
of extraordinary public service.

41:08.688 --> 41:11.690
She has my full faith and confidence.

41:11.691 --> 41:14.460
When I have passed
extensive medical tests

41:14.461 --> 41:17.696
and the doctors say I'm 100% ready,

41:17.697 --> 41:20.365
only then will I be reinstated

41:20.366 --> 41:23.435
under Section 3 of the 25th Amendment.

41:23.436 --> 41:25.904
Finally, I'd like to pay tribute

41:25.905 --> 41:28.474
to the resiliency of our Constitution,

41:28.475 --> 41:32.211
a 230-year-old document that
has endured the challenges

41:32.212 --> 41:34.480
of every stage of our
nation's journey.

41:34.481 --> 41:38.417
Our government is built on
an ingenious foundation

41:38.418 --> 41:40.352
of principles and laws,

41:40.353 --> 41:43.622
and though the people within
that system are fallible,

41:43.623 --> 41:45.557
the system itself

41:45.558 --> 41:48.260
is devised to withstand anything,

41:48.261 --> 41:51.063
even an unfit president.

41:51.064 --> 41:53.632
The fact that the system
worked as it should

41:53.633 --> 41:56.168
proves that our democracy

41:56.169 --> 41:58.103
is as strong as ever.

41:58.104 --> 42:00.439
I thank the brave cabinet secretaries

42:00.440 --> 42:03.275
who voted to invoke
the 25th Amendment.

42:03.276 --> 42:07.813
They are all true American
heroes and patriots.

42:07.814 --> 42:09.081
They put their country

42:09.082 --> 42:11.650
ahead of their personal
relationship with me.

42:11.651 --> 42:14.653
<i>That's what separates
us from dictatorships</i>

42:14.654 --> 42:17.523
<i>and oligarchies.</i>

42:17.524 --> 42:21.994
Without people of such courage,
<i>our democracy would be lost,</i>

42:21.995 --> 42:25.063
<i>and they will forever
have my gratitude.</i>

42:25.064 --> 42:26.999
<i>And because of them,</i>

42:27.000 --> 42:30.202
<i>I have never felt more
proud to be an American.</i>

42:30.203 --> 42:34.605
And now Acting President Hurst
would like to say a few words.

42:37.075 --> 42:40.579
Thank you, Mr. President.

42:40.580 --> 42:43.447
Good evening, fellow Americans.
