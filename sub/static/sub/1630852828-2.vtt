WEBVTT

00:06.080 --> 00:10.920
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:38.200 --> 00:41.000
CÁSSIA
I dreamt of you too

00:47.760 --> 00:49.160
Of course you did, baby.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.000
Did you think of me
when you scored a goal?

01:05.960 --> 01:08.160
CÁSSIA
I don't know if I can wait that long

01:08.240 --> 01:09.720
It won't be long now

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
CÁSSIA
That is too long

01:10.880 --> 01:12.000
Bye, see you tomorrow.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.560
It's a little early for dinner

01:31.720 --> 01:33.640
Fuck dinner.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.560
I don't believe it.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
Fuck.

03:30.600 --> 03:36.040
UNTIL LIFE DO US PART

03:58.760 --> 04:01.040
Tobacco kills. You haven't heard?

04:02.680 --> 04:05.320
If that thing you drive around at night
doesn't kill me first.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.440
Give me a cigarette, come on.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.040
Really?

04:22.760 --> 04:25.640
Since when do you have a fancy lighter?

04:26.560 --> 04:28.360
And since when do you smoke?

04:32.120 --> 04:36.560
I've smoked for 30 years, my boy.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.920
What are you doing up at 3:00 a.m.?

04:45.600 --> 04:48.360
I haven't slept since 1972.

04:49.120 --> 04:53.480
But you're too young to have insomnia.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.560
Maybe that thing you drive around at night
won't let me sleep, ever thought of that?

04:58.640 --> 05:01.640
Look, your son called it vintage.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.000
-Vintage.
-Vintage.

05:05.760 --> 05:06.760
That's it.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.640
Since I don't sleep,
I drive it around the farm.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.600
Did you know there are bats
on the other side?

05:17.760 --> 05:19.400
In Dracula's cave?

05:21.240 --> 05:23.400
Have you been eating at this hour?

05:27.080 --> 05:29.600
Let's say that I destroyed a wedding cake.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.880
Was it good at least?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.040
It was too sweet.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.280
My doctor always told me,

05:39.360 --> 05:45.080
"Sugar, alcohol and tobacco
ruin a guy's sex drive."

05:45.640 --> 05:48.600
I don't think I'll need it any time soon.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.920
Do you want Viagra?

05:53.680 --> 05:56.320
-That's not the problem.
-Then what is it?

05:57.400 --> 06:00.320
It's the rest. All the other things.

06:05.400 --> 06:10.080
"WE HAVE TO TALK"
IS THE WORST SENTENCE EVER

06:10.760 --> 06:11.920
Shall we start?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.840
Why do the vegan ones taste better?

06:16.320 --> 06:17.400
VEGAN ONES TASTE BETTER

06:17.480 --> 06:20.400
-This…
-It's the semen's quality, love.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.320
-The quality of what?
-The sperm. It tastes better.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.400
Because vegans eat more vegetables
and fruit. That's what they say.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.160
So, how did you meet?

06:35.320 --> 06:40.640
<i>We're live! Smile, love!</i>
<i>Hi, my babies. How are you?</i>

06:41.760 --> 06:45.680
So, we're here
at our final wedding interview.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.800
I can't reveal the location
because it's top secret.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.400
It's such a very special moment
in our lives.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.360
That's just the way she is.
She gets easily excited.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.040
And you don't?

07:01.520 --> 07:03.120
When I'm on the field.

07:04.560 --> 07:08.160
-And off the field?
-I like to have a more low-key life.

07:08.240 --> 07:12.160
Playing for Lisbon Sports Club
probably doesn't help.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.800
And Cássia hosting the most-viewed
afternoon program doesn't either.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.320
That's why I don't give interviews.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.880
Only when my agent allows it.
Like this one.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.080
A super special cake, made by Chef Loco.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.240
<i>With sugar pearls from Fiji. Right, love?</i>

07:33.960 --> 07:36.720
<i>Later, if you're paying attention…</i>

07:36.800 --> 07:41.240
-So, let's continue, how did you meet?
-On social media.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.280
<i>My babies, see you later.</i>

07:48.040 --> 07:50.520
Do you have to say it like that,
"on social media"?

07:51.080 --> 07:53.000
We look like those Tinder nutcases.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.000
But it was on Instagram.
What's the difference?

07:57.800 --> 08:01.240
-Can we start again?
-Of course. Of course we can.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.720
-Great.
-Maybe we'll try another approach.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.000
For example, Baldé,
where do you see yourself in ten years?

08:10.560 --> 08:14.320
Club captain, children, still in love?

08:15.600 --> 08:18.640
Honestly, I don't know.
Football is so uncertain.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.960
I may not even be
with Lisbon Sports Club next year.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.200
What do you mean, you don't know?

08:28.640 --> 08:31.120
You never know what tomorrow will be like.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.040
-Can you turn the camera off, please?
-Sure.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.320
Baldé, we have to talk.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.160
"We have to talk"?
That's the worst sentence ever.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.240
Days of Passion, good morning.

09:15.400 --> 09:19.920
No, ma'am, it's not an escort site,
it's a wedding company.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.880
What?

09:23.960 --> 09:25.400
I'm here in a situation--

09:25.480 --> 09:28.040
What's going on?
The phone won't stop ringing.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.400
They already called from RTP Azores
wanting to know our address.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.600
I'll call you back. Thank you.
I'll call you to arrange it. Thank you.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.720
-Who was it?
-No one. What's going on?

09:44.520 --> 09:45.800
<i>It was Vasco, wasn't it?</i>

09:46.640 --> 09:50.920
That Vasco is a very handsome boy.
Plus, he's rich.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.560
I would do it.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.440
That son of a bitch
always wanted to be with you.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.040
Vanessa. Vanessa!

10:02.920 --> 10:05.080
-What?
-That's what I'm asking you.

10:05.160 --> 10:09.960
I thought the wedding of that famous
what's-her-name was a state secret.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.520
Do you know anything about this?

10:15.920 --> 10:17.320
It's a cake.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.840
It was lying
on the kitchen floor this morning.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.080
A cake that wanted to run away?

10:23.160 --> 10:24.600
Don't play dumb, Daniel.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.960
I won't be able to fix this cake properly.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.200
Plus, I'm out of sugar pearls
from Mauritius.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.040
From Fiji, Mom. From Fiji.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.600
For Princess Diana's wedding, we used
coconut chips from the Philippines.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.680
-Vanessa, we need to talk.
-About what?

10:42.760 --> 10:44.560
You know very well about what.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.520
There's no time for this, Daniel.
We have a million things to do.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.640
You have no time to talk about us?

10:56.440 --> 10:59.960
Vanessa, we need to talk.
I can't sleep on the couch anymore.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.320
-I can't stop thinking about it.
-Nobody picks up the phone?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.720
-I don't sleep!
-Those damn…

11:06.280 --> 11:07.400
Days of Passion.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.240
<i>Revista Fama?</i>

11:11.840 --> 11:13.240
About whose wedding?

11:18.120 --> 11:23.000
Sorry, miss, this is an escort site, okay?
Thank you very much.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.320
But what's there to think about?

11:28.520 --> 11:30.560
Are you sure you want to split up?

11:32.040 --> 11:35.600
-Do you really want to talk about it?
-Why, you don't think they'll notice it?

11:35.680 --> 11:39.240
The only thing I care about right now
is saving the business.

11:40.040 --> 11:44.000
You'll save the business
by turning the farm into a kind of brothel

11:44.080 --> 11:46.200
for gossip magazines' paparazzi?

11:46.280 --> 11:49.120
I don't know how that happened.
It was an accident.

11:49.200 --> 11:53.040
It happened because
famous people attract outcasts

11:53.120 --> 11:54.480
as dogs attract fleas!

11:54.560 --> 11:58.840
Listen carefully, Daniel.
This marriage was a favor Marta did me.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.880
Cássia, that's her name.
Cássia is her patient.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.680
She's also one of the most famous people
in this country.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.120
This is a gift, do you understand? A gift.

12:09.200 --> 12:13.160
If this goes well, all the famous people
will want to get married here.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.800
And do you know what that means? Money!

12:17.520 --> 12:20.200
Did you know that for over three years,
no one chose menu A?

12:20.760 --> 12:22.040
What's menu A?

12:24.240 --> 12:25.920
It's the rich people's catering.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.840
It costs three times
as much as the other ones.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.880
And when you have the farm
filled with menu C photographers

12:31.960 --> 12:33.080
ruining the flowerbeds?

12:33.160 --> 12:37.320
-The official photographer is you.
-I'm not a photographer of idiots.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.640
Speaking of idiots,

12:38.720 --> 12:42.440
your parents raised our rent, didn't they?
Since we have to pay it…

12:45.320 --> 12:48.520
It's Vasco again, isn't it?
You'd do that fucker?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.160
-What?
-We have to talk about our situation.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.920
<i>This is our exterior.</i>

13:01.000 --> 13:05.480
<i>My God, we've reached the exterior.</i>
<i>I just can't. I'm moved.</i>

13:05.560 --> 13:09.320
<i>I'm already imagining the tables here.</i>
<i>This is beautiful.</i>

13:10.480 --> 13:13.760
Just a minute, I have a wonderful pool.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.280
I think it's a wonderful garden.
It helps with the organization.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.080
And we're lucky
to be one hour from Lisbon.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.160
…it's less than one hour from Lisbon.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.600
My grandfather
usually helps with the farm stuff.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.200
<i>Grandpa!</i>

13:26.280 --> 13:29.560
<i>-You play for Lisbon Sports Club?</i>
<i>-Yes, I do. Are you a fan?</i>

13:29.640 --> 13:34.520
<i>No! I hate Lisbon Sports Club!</i>
<i>I support Belenenses.</i>

13:34.600 --> 13:35.840
<i>-Kiss-kiss!</i>
<i>-Let's continue.</i>

13:36.680 --> 13:40.200
-Sorry, what are you talking about?
-Nothing, I was just continuing the tour.

13:40.280 --> 13:44.200
We can arrange the tables as you wish.
If you want to set up the altar there,

13:44.280 --> 13:46.600
we have several options for wreaths.

13:46.680 --> 13:51.000
-…the tables.
-Yes. It will also depend on the number…

14:10.280 --> 14:14.200
Of course it will. I can explain
a better route to get to the farm.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.400
Can you write it down?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.080
How did this happen?

14:21.280 --> 14:25.800
I don't know. Apparently the lady
went live with the GPS location on,

14:25.880 --> 14:28.440
and then everybody knew
where it was. That's normal.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.120
What's wrong?

14:33.640 --> 14:36.640
-What's wrong with what?
-With you.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.000
Nothing is wrong with me.
Why, is something wrong with you?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.440
Did you finish your thesis?

14:43.920 --> 14:46.920
-You're changing the subject.
-What do you want to know?

14:47.960 --> 14:50.680
If you'll keep sleeping in the office.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.680
That's 13 nights in a row.
It never used to be this long.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.160
In 2018, it was four. In 2019, six.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.440
This year it's already 13.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.800
That's a record, don't you think?

14:59.880 --> 15:01.880
That's probably why my back hurts.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.320
And it's just because of your back?

15:06.800 --> 15:09.960
Marco, what was that divorce statistic?

15:10.440 --> 15:13.080
-Fifty out of 100?
-Seventy out of 100.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.440
We should change our business
and open a divorce company.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.800
Imagine, Divorces of St. Anthony.

15:30.120 --> 15:34.640
But look, another statistic
claims that 85% of the divorced people

15:34.720 --> 15:36.680
feel much better after the separation.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.840
RITA
I'd do him too, Mom

16:29.800 --> 16:33.240
VASCO
This was the first time I saw you

17:46.840 --> 17:52.400
I THINK WE'RE MARRYING
TWO PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED

18:18.320 --> 18:20.080
I need to see the grounds, please.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.240
-Armando. I need to see--
-The grounds. Understood, General.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.440
-Good morning. I'm Rita.
-Good morning. Nice to meet you, Rita.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.600
Is that always
how you arrive at a wedding?

18:32.680 --> 18:36.160
With an insatiable desire to know
the twists and turns of the wedding?

18:36.920 --> 18:38.480
"The twists and turns of the wedding"?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.680
-Sounds like a humanities class.
-Sociology.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.080
Actually, psychology and then sociology.
And a year in anthropology.

18:45.160 --> 18:51.320
Anthropology, psychology, sociology.
So, in that case, I'll call you Ology.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.520
-If you don't mind, of course.
-Are you a friend of the groom, General?

18:54.600 --> 18:58.440
The general is the groom's security guard.
His friends are those boys over there.

18:58.520 --> 19:02.680
His friends look like his security guard,
who in turn looks like his friend.

19:02.760 --> 19:03.920
Shall we?

19:13.280 --> 19:15.400
Yes, André showed up for work.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.480
I just hope he didn't smoke too many.

19:19.800 --> 19:24.720
Basically, they put a guy in every corner
of the house to control the ins and outs.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.040
To keep paparazzi out. That's normal.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.560
But first, a security guard
came to see the house.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.960
That's the price of fame.
But you know that, don't you?

19:35.640 --> 19:38.840
Well, look, I have to go
because the wedding is starting.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.160
I'll miss you too.

19:46.000 --> 19:46.840
See you later.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.400
-André, have you seen my dad?
-No.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.360
Meet… What did you say your name was?

20:05.920 --> 20:07.640
Fábio Neves. Nice to meet you.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.400
Everybody knows Fábio Neves.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.840
Dude, you're the guy from the commercials.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.760
No, he isn't. He's the players' agent.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.320
The commercials for the pills
that make your dick hard.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.160
Finally someone recognizes me
because of those commercials. Yes, sir.

20:24.680 --> 20:27.560
Do you know why Ronaldo can jump so high?

20:28.840 --> 20:31.680
Strength in the dick, boys,
strength in the dick.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.280
It's called Virilix. It is 100% natural.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.080
You take this
and you're ready for anything.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.520
And when I say anything,
I mean anything, okay?

20:49.160 --> 20:51.280
-Maybe you better not keep this.
-Hello?

20:51.840 --> 20:54.480
-Are they here or not?
-Who?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.120
The bride and groom.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.480
Rita said five minutes, dude.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.760
-Don't call me "dude."
-Dude, sorry.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.600
Marco. I'm Vanda.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.360
From the band. Vanda from the band.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.280
Yes, Vanda. Are you all right?

21:10.360 --> 21:14.960
At the last wedding, we agreed
to have a drink after the next one.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.640
Which is this wedding.
Remember that or not?

21:18.680 --> 21:23.920
Yes, I think I do. But look,
I'm working and I'm very busy.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.680
If you want, you can talk to Rita.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.920
She's available
and she will help you, okay?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.360
Excuse me, sorry.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.480
Dad! You have two minutes.
The bride and groom are coming.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.040
Come on, let's go.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.440
Counting last night, it's now 14.

22:01.040 --> 22:01.960
What?

22:03.480 --> 22:06.520
Fourteen nights in a row
sleeping on the couch. Hurry up!

22:33.560 --> 22:35.720
The bride and groom are coming, come!

22:35.800 --> 22:37.440
Where is your dad?

22:38.520 --> 22:41.520
-Dad must be on his way to 15.
-What?

22:50.960 --> 22:53.160
Long live the bride and groom!

22:54.400 --> 22:56.200
Stand together there for a photo.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.200
-Come on, just a kiss. Come on, just one.
-A little kiss.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.480
Yes!

23:05.200 --> 23:07.880
-I'll go and see what happened. See you.
-See you.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.520
-Princess Diana?
-You have no idea.

23:32.640 --> 23:38.000
Joaquim and I stayed at Buckingham Palace
in the lower quarters.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.600
Under the stairs?

23:39.680 --> 23:43.440
Yes, to protect the royal family's silver.

23:47.040 --> 23:47.960
Done!

23:49.400 --> 23:50.320
Hey!

23:50.400 --> 23:51.240
Vanessa.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.240
-Don't you dare!
-This room is mine too.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.440
Get out.

23:59.920 --> 24:04.600
-Vanessa, I know I fucked up. I'm sorry.
-You didn't only fuck up today.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.840
I'm not getting any sleep,
I'm a wreck. What do you want?

24:07.920 --> 24:09.280
You smell like alcohol.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.600
I'll keep pushing it until you talk to me.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.080
Daniel, have you looked outside?

24:18.800 --> 24:22.800
The wedding is about to start,
and everyone is taking photos but you!

24:22.880 --> 24:25.320
Great. That means
they don't need me for anything.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.880
-Do your job!
-Talk to me!

24:28.440 --> 24:29.600
Zip me up.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.520
What have I done?

24:33.600 --> 24:36.560
Me, me, me. This isn't about you.
It's not all about you!

24:36.640 --> 24:39.320
This is about me and how I feel!

24:39.800 --> 24:44.080
All I'm asking is that you respect that
and do your job today!

24:46.520 --> 24:49.680
Otherwise, next month,
we'll have neither a farm nor a business.

24:51.720 --> 24:52.800
Nor a family.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.680
I like your bedroom.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.680
It smells like chewing gum,
like a teenage girl's room.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.640
What happened, Cássia?

25:31.240 --> 25:35.600
What happens to people who have met,
but don't actually know each other, baby.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.240
I don't get it.

25:42.760 --> 25:46.800
So, I'd see Baldé on TV kicking a ball…

25:48.800 --> 25:51.720
and he would see me doing interviews.

25:53.360 --> 25:57.960
I don't understand a thing about football,
and he doesn't understand anything…

25:59.880 --> 26:00.880
about anything.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.200
I don't think that's how people
get to know each other.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.400
You're really naive, aren't you, baby?

26:17.800 --> 26:21.480
Why do you think
celebrities marry other celebrities?

26:22.880 --> 26:27.040
Because there's this kind of silent pact.

26:28.520 --> 26:32.800
People meet without knowing each other.
That's how it is in the world I live in.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.880
But now you're having second thoughts?

26:42.840 --> 26:45.040
Baldé and I argued all night.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.320
-May I ask why?
-You may.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.920
Because that son of a bitch agent of his
wants to sell him

26:55.000 --> 26:56.640
to a club in Saudi Arabia.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.280
-That's far away as hell.
-Yes, it is.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.880
Do you see me in Saudi Arabia,

27:01.960 --> 27:04.000
dressed all in black,
with only my eyes showing?

27:04.480 --> 27:07.200
-No.
-Right. Neither do I.

27:08.200 --> 27:12.480
"Fábio this, Fábio that. Fábio…"

27:13.520 --> 27:17.160
Football players are little children
in the hands of their agents.

27:17.880 --> 27:23.400
If I wanted to marry Fábio,
I'd marry Fábio, not Baldé.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.640
But it looks like
I'll have to marry both of them.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.880
You still have time to say no.
It's always an option in weddings.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.240
That would only be
the scandal of the year.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.560
But there are no paparazzi
or journalists on the farm.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.880
Little baby, have you seen
how many people are out there?

27:43.600 --> 27:47.320
Nowadays,
we're all paparazzi and journalists.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.000
I'll give you an example.

27:54.720 --> 27:55.880
Smile, beautiful.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.040
You're already on the front page.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.800
Plus, Baldé's semen is not vegan at all.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.000
<i>Dust on my foot</i>

28:18.640 --> 28:20.160
<i>Blue sky</i>

28:20.880 --> 28:24.240
<i>I won't change the sunset</i>

28:24.880 --> 28:28.280
<i>In the skin, we are one</i>

28:29.040 --> 28:33.160
<i>My cream is your salt</i>

28:33.240 --> 28:36.040
<i>Come here and see it</i>

28:37.240 --> 28:40.160
<i>Melting</i>

28:43.480 --> 28:46.400
So, have you thought about
what we talked about or not?

28:48.000 --> 28:48.880
Fábio.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.920
-You know you're like a father to me--
-Stop.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.240
You're not going to give me
the "but" talk, are you?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.080
Do you know who gave me the "but" talk?

28:58.640 --> 29:00.040
Dani, in 1996.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.400
That guy could have been a world star.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.200
"You're like a father to me, but…"

29:05.200 --> 29:06.240
You know it, but…

29:06.320 --> 29:09.400
You know how many
have ruined a career because of "buts"?

29:09.960 --> 29:12.720
But… Cássia doesn't want
to leave Portugal.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.840
-And?
-And what?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.880
Who wears the pants?
Or rather, the shorts?

29:19.840 --> 29:20.800
You have to…

29:22.200 --> 29:23.080
It's time.

29:23.720 --> 29:28.200
-You have to put her in her place, okay?
-There's no other options?

29:29.400 --> 29:32.320
Do you know how many guys
were about to jump

29:32.400 --> 29:34.520
and ended up jumping
into their mommy's house?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.440
I fucking said no.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.040
I'll get the contract on my cell phone
in a few moments.

29:42.120 --> 29:45.640
You just have to sign it.
Now go on. You go and get married.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.040
But look, never forget
who's the boss here. It's you.

30:03.640 --> 30:10.120
<i>I'll go with you</i>

30:10.880 --> 30:17.640
<i>I'll go with you</i>

30:17.720 --> 30:23.360
<i>I'll go with you</i>

30:35.240 --> 30:39.680
…in health and in sickness,
in wealth and in poverty,

30:40.600 --> 30:46.000
loving you every day of my life
until death do us part.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.200
The wedding rings, please.

30:59.840 --> 31:04.200
Baldé, look at me.
Baldé, put the fucking ring on.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.640
What's going on?

31:07.720 --> 31:09.160
Baldé, put it on.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.280
I think we're marrying two people
who don't want to get married.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.360
-Put the fucking ring on!
-Cássia, I'm signing the contract.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.080
You sign whatever shit you want.
Put the ring on.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.800
This marriage only needs to last
six months. It'll then be forgotten.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.680
Put the ring on, please. Now!

31:28.040 --> 31:29.760
I declare you husband and wife.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.840
You're so fucked up.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.080
It's more than that.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.880
Not one? You couldn't even get one?

31:55.520 --> 31:58.280
-What's going on? What happened?
-Auntie, you have no idea.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.160
André, I'm tired of telling you,
I'm not your aunt.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.320
Auntie, I'm sorry,

32:03.400 --> 32:06.760
but Uncle couldn't even
take one single photo.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.080
You're kidding me. You must be kidding me.

32:11.160 --> 32:15.040
When I switched the cards, I accidentally
made a mistake and put the same one back.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.760
That's because you had a hangover.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.280
-Aren't you going to answer it?
-Now, how do we solve this problem?

32:22.840 --> 32:25.200
Will you tell the bride and groom
there are no wedding photos?

32:25.280 --> 32:28.320
-But there are photos. Everybody--
-Official photos, Daniel!

32:35.960 --> 32:42.400
<i>I'll not carry on in omission</i>

32:43.440 --> 32:46.160
<i>To please</i>

32:47.320 --> 32:51.600
<i>I live in reverse</i>

32:51.680 --> 32:55.840
<i>Of the time in me</i>

32:58.480 --> 32:59.920
Since when am I responsible--

33:00.000 --> 33:03.280
I know you threw the cake on the floor.
You must have been drunk.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.520
No, you're wrong. I wasn't drunk yet.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.880
-Who keeps calling you?
-Do you really want to know?

33:12.120 --> 33:14.240
-Who is Mr. João Sequeira?
-He's my lawyer.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.360
-I never heard of him.
-I never needed a lawyer.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.640
-Why do you need one?
-For the divorce.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.920
-For what?
-For the divorce!

33:23.760 --> 33:26.240
But I… I don't want to get divorced.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.040
I don't want to split up.
I don't want to…

33:28.120 --> 33:31.520
I don't want to give this up,
give up on us, give up on you.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.280
It's out of your hands, Daniel.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.960
I've told you,
don't take any more pictures!

33:52.800 --> 33:55.640
Don't take any more pictures!

33:55.720 --> 34:00.080
Keep walking! Out!

34:02.160 --> 34:03.600
Baldé, let go of me!

34:03.680 --> 34:06.680
-What happened?
-An undercover paparazzo.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.760
-How did they find out?
-They realized that no one knew him.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.400
By now, he must have already sent
a bunch of photos to all the magazines.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.320
Too bad.
There goes the not-so-secret wedding.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.600
Are all weddings here like this, Ology?
Full of excitement?

34:21.680 --> 34:23.320
Always, General. Always.

34:39.640 --> 34:45.160
Peekaboo. Look who it is.

34:46.960 --> 34:51.760
Vanda, I have to go back
to disassemble the circus.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.080
You have to go back to the circus.

34:54.160 --> 34:58.480
This is my favorite place
here on your farm, you know?

34:58.560 --> 35:00.880
Sometimes, we even
keep the instruments here.

35:02.160 --> 35:08.680
One time, Marco, I got so drunk

35:09.440 --> 35:14.360
that, look, I slept right here. See?

35:15.040 --> 35:19.800
On this straw. Look at little Vanda
sleeping on the straw, Marco.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.240
Okay, I didn't know.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.320
You didn't?

35:26.440 --> 35:29.440
Are you afraid of me, Marco? Are you?

35:30.280 --> 35:33.320
Vanda, I don't even know you. How would I

35:33.800 --> 35:34.920
fear you…

35:47.000 --> 35:52.440
I have to go back and help,
if you don't mind.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.120
Nothing?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.840
Today was a day and pears!

36:04.520 --> 36:07.240
I never understood that expression.
What are the pears?

36:07.720 --> 36:12.680
Well, in my day, there was fruit.

36:14.360 --> 36:20.080
Then there were pears,
which appeared from time to time.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.440
Good, juicy ones.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.600
Yellow as the sun.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.920
And also the most expensive.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.440
And the rarest.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.560
So, how's that insomnia?

36:46.360 --> 36:48.840
It's 2:00 in the morning,
but it feels like 9:00.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.360
Is it still difficult?

36:54.360 --> 36:55.680
It's all very confusing.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.880
The pieces are all separate.

37:00.040 --> 37:03.640
I want to put them together,
but I can't do it.

37:04.720 --> 37:08.080
And believe me, I try very hard.
I'm stubborn.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.600
But that's not enough.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.640
The other person
has to want it too, right?

37:12.720 --> 37:14.600
We can't force anyone.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.760
You can't force what, Grandpa?

37:19.280 --> 37:21.240
We were talking about pears.

37:23.160 --> 37:28.560
Those good, fleshy,
juicy, really ripe ones.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.360
We even dream about them.

37:32.440 --> 37:35.320
We want them to come to us.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.840
But we can't force them to.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.040
You can't sleep either, son?

37:43.040 --> 37:43.920
No.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.120
Well…

37:49.440 --> 37:50.440
Where are you going?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.240
I'm going to check on the bats.
It's their time of night.

37:55.080 --> 37:56.960
Can that jalopy handle two of us?

37:58.040 --> 38:01.400
It could even handle three.
Do you want to come?

38:01.480 --> 38:04.560
-No, Grandpa, it's okay, thank you.
-All right, let's go.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.080
Yes, I understand, Cássia.

38:12.160 --> 38:18.040
Yes, but there was a problem
with the camera's memory card.

38:21.680 --> 38:27.080
I didn't worry you then because I thought
you no longer wanted the wedding photos.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.680
Of course.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.240
Of course, yes.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.040
I'll see what I can do.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.600
Good day. Have a good day, thank you.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.240
Shit.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.480
Daniel, Cássia wants the photos after all…
