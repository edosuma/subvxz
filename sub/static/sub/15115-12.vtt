Wow, what's with Maybin?
She just bit my head off.

You didn't mention
Donald O'Connor, did you?

00:43.103 --> 00:44.649
- Yeah.
- Big mistake.

00:44.749 --> 00:47.347
Hey, question... when is the adult
tap class doing a recital?

00:47.447 --> 00:48.663
Well, I'd say probably never.

00:48.763 --> 00:50.375
What? Why?

00:50.475 --> 00:51.887
The shorties do recitals all the time.

00:51.987 --> 00:53.795
Yeah, but the shorties
have a built in audience.

00:53.895 --> 00:54.849
You guys don't.

00:54.948 --> 00:55.835
Are you saying people wouldn't come

00:55.935 --> 00:57.349
to an adult tap recital?

00:57.448 --> 01:00.375
They might if it was an
adult film star tap recital.

01:00.475 --> 01:01.955
Well, then maybe not a recital,

01:02.054 --> 01:03.140
but we have to do something.

01:03.239 --> 01:05.410
Oh, I know. How about
a tap dance flash mob?

01:05.509 --> 01:06.463
A tap dance flash mob?

01:06.563 --> 01:07.516
Yeah yeah.

01:07.614 --> 01:08.898
Like we run into Nordstroms
without warning

01:08.998 --> 01:10.937
and we surround that
dude playing the piano,

01:11.038 --> 01:12.188
and then we do a shuffle step,

01:12.288 --> 01:13.700
a couple of stamps, add a flap heel,

01:13.800 --> 01:14.951
and then we throw shoes at him.

01:15.051 --> 01:16.760
Why would you throw shoes at him?

01:16.859 --> 01:17.781
I don't know. 'Cause we're
mad at him for some reason.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.556
Maybe we could set up some sort of

01:19.656 --> 01:22.584
performance in town that
wouldn't include an assault.

01:22.684 --> 01:24.163
Well, I'm open.

See you.

Hey.

01:26.896 --> 01:28.737
What happened with
Maybin and Donald O'Connor?

01:28.836 --> 01:30.611
Oh, it's dark. Really dark.

01:30.711 --> 01:32.257
Oh, and don't mention Fiorello Laguardia

What are you doing here?

01:58.184 --> 01:59.731
I totally blew at class today.

I just couldn't nail
that move you showed us...

02:01.078 --> 02:03.183
that fouette into the attitude turn.

02:03.283 --> 02:04.500
Yeah, it's tricky.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.230
Yeah, so I thought I'd
come down and rehearse a little.

02:07.330 --> 02:09.369
I like it when it's empty and quiet.

02:09.469 --> 02:10.817
Didn't mean to interrupt anything.

02:10.917 --> 02:12.528
No, I was just taking off.
The place is all yours.

02:12.627 --> 02:13.779

so we're going through
a much-needed quiet period.

02:22.629 --> 02:24.438

02:30.921 --> 02:31.742
Very.

02:31.842 --> 02:33.057
And I hope you know that if you ever

02:33.157 --> 02:34.242
need someone to talk to,

02:34.342 --> 02:36.282
or just a place to hang...

- Maybe.

- never mind.
- You were gonna what?

06:39.620 --> 06:41.297
I don't want to say.

- Are you well?
- Yes.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.586
She fell behind in her
summer reading list for school.

07:23.642 --> 07:24.891

08:12.072 --> 08:13.320
This is ridiculous.

Wait wait. Hold on here.

08:17.170 --> 08:19.144
Is there something else.
Something you're not telling me?

08:19.244 --> 08:20.493
I switched deodorants.

08:20.593 --> 08:22.006
I'm very unsure about this new deodorant.

08:22.105 --> 08:24.836
No, Boo. We were apart for six weeks.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.272
Is there anything you need to say to me?

08:27.371 --> 08:28.554
- Like what?
<i>- You know what.</i>

08:28.653 --> 08:31.119
Look, I have nothing to confess to.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.863
I was good. Not that Camp Wannapamothpa

08:32.962 --> 08:34.837
is a hot bed of sexual activity,

08:34.937 --> 08:37.075
but the girls' camp is just a
quick swim across that lake.

08:37.174 --> 08:39.806
And guys were swimming
across that lake at night.

08:39.905 --> 08:42.143
It's not safe. But I never did.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.925
So what about you?

08:46.025 --> 08:48.162
No, nothing.

08:48.262 --> 08:49.282
Boo.

08:51.026 --> 08:52.539
I saw "Magic Mike" twice.

08:52.638 --> 08:54.676
That's it? Really?

08:54.777 --> 08:56.258
<i>All this is because you smell?</i>

08:56.357 --> 08:57.343
Yes?

08:57.442 --> 08:59.612
Great. And I totally get it.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.750
Channing Tatum is a fine actor.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.231
Kiss me quick then step away.

09:03.331 --> 09:04.811
Cool.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.061
Wait, don't breathe in.

09:08.332 --> 09:09.482
There will be better kissing

09:09.583 --> 09:10.601
after the bath bomb.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.149
Excellent.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.826
Oh, and hey, Thursday
night's still good, right?

09:13.925 --> 09:15.142
My mom needs to know.

09:15.241 --> 09:16.688
Your mom? For what?

09:16.787 --> 09:18.365
For dinner. You're meeting the parents.

09:18.465 --> 09:20.175
Did we make that plan?

09:20.275 --> 09:21.952
<i>Before I left. It's the perfect time...</i>

09:22.051 --> 09:23.465
<i>before school gets too crazy.</i>

09:23.566 --> 09:24.913
And I was gonna meet your parents.

09:25.013 --> 09:26.098
Is none of this ringing a bell?

09:26.198 --> 09:27.678
No no no. It's ringing a bell.

09:27.777 --> 09:29.421
<i>My mother's been talking</i>
<i>about this for weeks,</i>

09:29.520 --> 09:30.507
so are we on?

09:30.607 --> 09:32.084
Sure.

09:32.184 --> 09:33.467
<i>Good. It'll be fun.</i>

09:33.566 --> 09:35.836
And take this with you.

09:35.935 --> 09:38.205
While everyone else
was swimming and fornicating,

09:38.304 --> 09:39.325
I carved this for you because you like

09:39.424 --> 09:41.231
"The Hunger Games" so much.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.273
It's crude, but it'll do some damage.

09:45.016 --> 09:46.102
Thanks.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.752
I'm glad you're back.

09:49.852 --> 09:51.826
Me too.

09:53.044 --> 09:54.031
I'll see you when I'm clean.

09:55.579 --> 09:56.629
Boo: <i>Bye.</i>

10:04.198 --> 10:06.729
Truly: <i>Help! Michelle, help.</i>

10:06.830 --> 10:08.375
Truly? Truly, what are you doing,

10:08.474 --> 10:09.658
selling things door to door?

10:09.758 --> 10:11.566
It's a long story. Can I come in, please?

10:11.666 --> 10:12.587
Yeah yeah yeah. It's open.

10:12.687 --> 10:14.298
Did you just see Katniss run by?

10:14.397 --> 10:15.482
Oh, with a bow and arrow? Yeah.

10:15.581 --> 10:16.733
Will you grab that, please?

10:18.708 --> 10:21.141
- What a nightmare.
- Did you not think it's strange

10:21.241 --> 10:22.522
that Katniss ran by?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.202
No. This is a <i>nightmare.</i>

10:24.299 --> 10:25.384
Truly, what's going on here?

10:25.484 --> 10:26.701
Well, I went to take all this to the shop.

10:26.801 --> 10:28.215
It's my new fall line.

10:28.314 --> 10:29.004
And you're liking
the polka dots this year.

10:29.104 --> 10:30.452
Very much. And I went to put

10:30.552 --> 10:32.328
my key in the door, and it doesn't fit.

10:32.427 --> 10:34.598
Whoa. That's a recurring dream I have.

10:34.697 --> 10:35.979
That I go up to my place,

10:36.078 --> 10:37.986
but it's only sorta kinda my place,

10:38.086 --> 10:39.994
all my stuff's there
but it's got 80-foot ceilings

10:40.093 --> 10:41.243
and weird wallpaper,

10:41.342 --> 10:42.822
and I go to put my key in the lock,

10:42.922 --> 10:44.073
only it's totally the wrong shape.

10:44.173 --> 10:46.277
Do you want to hear about my story or not?

10:46.377 --> 10:48.086
- Yes, go on.
- It's my stupid landlady.

10:48.186 --> 10:49.667
- She locked me out.
- What? Why?

10:49.766 --> 10:51.673
No reason except that she hates me.

10:51.773 --> 10:53.284
But she can't do that. You have a lease.

10:53.385 --> 10:54.666
Yes-sss.

10:54.766 --> 10:56.904
Truly, do you have a lease?

10:57.004 --> 10:58.418
No.

10:58.518 --> 11:00.425
So you're paying her month-to-month?

11:00.524 --> 11:02.334
Yep.

11:02.433 --> 11:04.043
I mean, when I was paying her.

11:04.143 --> 11:05.295
You haven't been paying her?

11:05.395 --> 11:06.609
This is not the time for judging,

11:06.709 --> 11:07.893
this is the time for hugs.

11:07.993 --> 11:09.899
- Facts first, hugs later.
- I had a lease,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.084
for five full years,

11:11.184 --> 11:12.204
and then she sent me the new lease

11:12.304 --> 11:13.585
and she had raised the rent so much

11:13.685 --> 11:15.756
I got mad and I threw it into the fire.

11:15.856 --> 11:17.369
You were reading it next to a fire?

11:17.469 --> 11:19.212
No, I lit a fire and I threw the lease in.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.922
Wow, you really wanted to burn that thing.

11:21.023 --> 11:23.389
Very very much.
I know I don't have a fireplace,

11:23.489 --> 11:24.442
so I had to find an Irish pub.

11:24.541 --> 11:26.252
And then I had to buy a pint,

11:26.352 --> 11:27.930
'cause it's rude not to
after you use their fireplace

11:28.030 --> 11:30.661
to burn your lease...
and it's sexual by the way.

11:30.761 --> 11:32.503
- What is?
- Your dream about the key.

11:32.602 --> 11:33.753
- Blatantly.
- Look, Truly,

11:33.853 --> 11:34.740
focus for me here.

11:34.841 --> 11:35.761
Your behind on your rent,

11:35.861 --> 11:36.781
you don't have a lease,

11:36.881 --> 11:37.998
- this is not good.
- I know.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.083
It's very bad.

11:39.183 --> 11:40.793
I tried to talk to my landlady about it,

11:40.893 --> 11:42.505
but she's not answering my phone calls

11:42.605 --> 11:44.875
and I can't get an appointment until March.

11:44.974 --> 11:47.177
So you want to leave your
stuff here for awhile?

11:47.277 --> 11:48.427
Can I?

11:48.527 --> 11:50.237
I just need sometime to think and regroup

11:50.336 --> 11:51.718
and figure out how I'm
going to come up with

11:51.818 --> 11:53.494
an extra $1200 a month.

11:53.594 --> 11:54.809
Absolutely.

11:54.910 --> 11:56.719
I have a little room in my armoire.

11:56.818 --> 11:58.693
We'll hang them up nice,
and we'll figure this out.

11:58.793 --> 12:00.601
- Thanks.
- This is really cute.

12:00.701 --> 12:02.476
I love the color. How much is this?

12:02.576 --> 12:04.911
$1200 a month?

12:06.557 --> 12:07.543
Let me think about it.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.130
All the freshmen look so young!

12:11.133 --> 12:12.511
Were we ever that young?

12:12.610 --> 12:15.628
Looks like a particularly
stupid crop this year too.

12:15.728 --> 12:17.237
It's that deer in the headlights thing.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.517
- It's unattractive.
- Hey, what are you listening to?

12:18.617 --> 12:20.159
- Hey don't.
- She got through "Gatsby,"

12:20.259 --> 12:22.721
and now she's listening to the
audio book of "The Scarlet Letter"

12:22.819 --> 12:24.559
while she reads "Fahrenheit 451."

12:24.658 --> 12:26.989
Yeah, "Fahrenheit 451,"
the book burning thing.

12:27.088 --> 12:29.154
Ray Bradbury was onto something there.

12:31.782 --> 12:34.079
<i>♪ Sing a song for the world today ♪</i>

12:34.178 --> 12:35.588
<i>♪ I feel good in a brand new way... ♪</i>

12:35.689 --> 12:37.100
- What are they?
- Newbies.

12:37.199 --> 12:38.347
But not freshmen.

12:38.446 --> 12:40.251
Everybody's staring at them.

12:46.915 --> 12:48.655
<i>♪ Feel lucky like I said I would... ♪</i>

12:48.755 --> 12:51.611
Wow. She shook her hair just
like in a shampoo commercial.

12:51.710 --> 12:54.334
<i>♪ Smiling in the neighborhood... ♪</i>

12:54.434 --> 12:56.172
What's with the flowers?

12:56.271 --> 12:58.308

12:58.407 --> 13:00.737

13:05.759 --> 13:08.188
<i>( Rapping on door )</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:09.305
Truly?

13:10.587 --> 13:11.864
Sorry, I couldn't wait any longer.

13:11.964 --> 13:13.112
You sleep so late.

13:13.212 --> 13:14.427
Well, I'm generally up late.

13:14.526 --> 13:15.608
Wait, you don't have a morning show?

13:15.707 --> 13:17.316
- A what?
- A morning show.

13:17.415 --> 13:18.628
I used to watch Matt and Katie

13:18.728 --> 13:19.546
and Al and Anne, and then

13:19.646 --> 13:20.992
Matt and Meredith and Al and Anne,

13:21.091 --> 13:22.830
and then Matt and Anne and Al and Natalie,

13:22.931 --> 13:24.602
and then I tried Charlie and
Gale and Seth and Nora,

13:24.702 --> 13:26.704
but when I found George and
Robin and Josh and Sam,

13:26.803 --> 13:29.134
I felt like I was home.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.644
What can I do for you, Truly?

13:30.742 --> 13:32.286
I have a big favor to ask you.

13:32.385 --> 13:34.581
I have a valued customer. Her name is Jill

13:34.681 --> 13:36.618
and every year I give her
a special pre-peek

13:36.718 --> 13:38.129
at my fall line. And if there was any way

13:38.228 --> 13:39.672
I could bring her by,
it would be so great.

13:39.772 --> 13:40.919
Yeah, sure. Bring her by.

13:41.019 --> 13:42.628
Great. Come on in, Jill.

13:42.726 --> 13:44.268
Oh, she's here with you now. Okay.

13:44.367 --> 13:46.533
So, here we are, Jill.

13:46.632 --> 13:49.192
It's a little unusual.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.965
Eclectic as we say

13:51.063 --> 13:52.343
what with the unmade bed.

13:52.443 --> 13:54.970
<i>But you are the first to see these,</i>

13:55.069 --> 13:56.020
and of course I can tailor

13:56.119 --> 13:57.202
anything just for you.

13:57.301 --> 13:59.172
Truly, I am loving the colors here.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.945
The colors are gorgeous.

14:01.044 --> 14:03.243
Will you excuse me just a second.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.263
( Whispering )
She's not really into the hard sell.

14:06.363 --> 14:07.247
( Whispering )
I wasn't hard selling her.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.823
I think the colors are gorgeous.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.530
The colors will speak for themselves.

14:10.630 --> 14:12.271
So the colors do the hard selling.

14:12.371 --> 14:15.292
This is my business. Please respect it.

14:15.391 --> 14:16.669
Okay.

14:16.769 --> 14:19.691
So, Jill. I will leave
you to browse in peace.

14:19.791 --> 14:21.528
And just let me know
if there's anything you need.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.301
I'd love coffee if you have some.

14:27.602 --> 14:28.489
Cream or sugar, Jill?

14:28.588 --> 14:30.000
<i>Both, please.</i>

14:32.922 --> 14:34.004
Sorry.

14:35.548 --> 14:37.024
Sorry.

14:37.124 --> 14:38.337
Sorry.

14:38.436 --> 14:41.488
( Speaking French )

14:42.804 --> 14:44.017
It's the new girl again.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.987
So she's French.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.153
She's speaking French.

14:48.253 --> 14:49.992
Does that make her French?

14:50.091 --> 14:52.093
I swear I saw her speaking Japanese

14:52.193 --> 14:53.865
to Mr. Yamimoto earlier today.

14:53.965 --> 14:56.360
She even looked a little
Japanese when she was doing it.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.264
Weird.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.708
Very weird.

14:59.809 --> 15:01.810
<i>( Bell ringing )</i>

15:03.749 --> 15:05.749
( Piano playing )

15:24.331 --> 15:25.939
She changed her clothes.

15:26.039 --> 15:27.909
- Her name's Cozette.
- Interesting.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.682
And her brother's name is Frankie.

15:29.782 --> 15:30.798
Franny and Zoe.

15:30.898 --> 15:32.832
No, Frankie and Cozette.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.474
Keep going, Boo.

15:34.574 --> 15:36.839
He's supposed to be a brilliant violinist.

15:36.938 --> 15:38.350
Ginny saw him playing piano.

15:40.155 --> 15:41.631
He wasn't wearing that tie before.

15:41.730 --> 15:42.944
Or those pants.

15:43.044 --> 15:45.178
( Speaking Spanish )

15:49.610 --> 15:51.185
And she speaks Spanish?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.220
And Japanese and French.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.715
And he plays the piano and the violin.

15:55.815 --> 15:57.554
I think I need to sit for awhile

15:57.654 --> 15:59.688
and clear my head.

16:04.679 --> 16:06.747
That only happens in the movies.

16:13.601 --> 16:14.877
(Folk music playing)

16:14.880 --> 16:16.613
Today's a good day
to order the fried chicken.

16:16.712 --> 16:18.120
We change the grease
the first of the month.

16:18.219 --> 16:19.528
Oh, but I like the taste of old grease.

16:19.627 --> 16:20.739
It's got wessonality.

16:20.839 --> 16:22.475
- Sorry.
<i>- This'll do.</i>

16:22.575 --> 16:24.538
Hey, take a look at this for me, will you?

16:24.638 --> 16:26.044
I'm not gonna say any more about it,

16:26.143 --> 16:27.813
just give me your thoughts.

16:27.912 --> 16:30.401
- Well, it's a car.
- It's a human.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.364
- Those aren't headlights?
- Those are eyeballs.

16:32.464 --> 16:34.034
- She's cute.
- It's a man.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.867
Is something eating his face?

16:35.966 --> 16:36.883
This is happening, yes.

16:36.982 --> 16:37.930
Who is this?

16:38.030 --> 16:39.241
It's a potential blind date.

16:39.341 --> 16:41.075
A close friend of mine is
trying to set me up with him

16:41.174 --> 16:43.105
and she knows me, so he might be great,

16:43.204 --> 16:45.987
but I get nervous around
new people, you know?

16:46.086 --> 16:48.967
- Absolutely.
- I either clam up or I talk too much.

16:49.066 --> 16:50.440
<i>That's a tough balancing act.</i>

16:50.539 --> 16:51.880
But I'm not meeting enough people.

16:51.980 --> 16:53.911
I should probably be going out more, right?

16:54.010 --> 16:55.482
You know, taking more chances.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.545
I'm soliciting dating advice
from a 16-year-old, aren't I?

16:57.644 --> 16:59.151
I'm 17 now.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.820
Oh, well, happy birthday.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.752
Could I ask you for some advice?

17:02.851 --> 17:04.487
Uh... I...

17:04.586 --> 17:06.616
Carl wants me to meet his parents.

17:06.714 --> 17:07.859
Yeah, I didn't quite say yes.

17:07.959 --> 17:09.727
- I don't know what to do.
- Well...

17:09.826 --> 17:10.709
I'm freaking out a little.

17:10.809 --> 17:12.281
Okay okay. Let's see.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.573
Meeting the parents.

17:14.673 --> 17:16.276
Well, Boo,

17:16.375 --> 17:18.241
my first piece of advice
would be "don't go."

17:18.339 --> 17:19.386
- I have to.
- Oh.

17:19.486 --> 17:21.318
Well then, my second piece of advice

17:21.417 --> 17:23.382
- would be "don't go."
- I have to.

17:23.481 --> 17:26.525
Oh, well then, my third, fourth and
fifth piece of advice would be...

17:26.625 --> 17:28.785
I got it, thanks. But I have to go.

17:28.884 --> 17:29.996
All right, all right.

17:30.096 --> 17:32.420
Well, let me just say this.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.776
The key to getting along
with Carl's parents...

17:34.876 --> 17:37.233
- Is to be myself.
- What are you, high? No.

17:37.332 --> 17:40.410
The trick is to be whoever it is
you think they want you to be.

17:40.509 --> 17:42.178
- Oh.
<i>- And to say whatever it is</i>

17:42.277 --> 17:43.324
<i>you think they want you to say.</i>

17:43.423 --> 17:44.797
Trust me. It's the only way.

17:44.896 --> 17:47.385
- So, don't be myself?
- Right.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.069
Well, that's good, because I
really don't know who I am.

17:50.168 --> 17:51.216
Well, there you go.

17:51.315 --> 17:52.655
Oh, and keep an eye on your watch

17:52.755 --> 17:54.456
because I'm telling you, 90 minutes in

17:54.556 --> 17:55.537
to the second,

17:55.637 --> 17:57.469
evenings like this go south fast.

17:57.569 --> 17:58.616
How so?

17:58.716 --> 18:00.810
Well, you could slip
and tell an off-color joke.

18:00.909 --> 18:01.858
I did that once.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.233
Or you could get drunk

18:03.333 --> 18:05.068
and call your boyfriend's dad
a pickle-puss.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.770
I did that once.
Or you could think it's funny

18:06.869 --> 18:09.258
to move the dog's mouth around
and make him say dirty things.

18:09.357 --> 18:10.634
I did that once.

18:10.733 --> 18:11.812
You're not drinking, so that'll help,

18:11.911 --> 18:13.581
but at that 90-minute mark cut if off.

18:13.680 --> 18:14.956
I don't have a watch.

18:15.055 --> 18:16.594
Oh.

18:16.693 --> 18:17.576
It's got a timer.

18:17.675 --> 18:19.082
Use it.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.374
Thanks. I've gotta get back there.

18:22.783 --> 18:24.975
He's only got one nose, right?

18:26.647 --> 18:27.759
I hope.

18:29.464 --> 18:30.674
Hi.

18:36.079 --> 18:38.009
- Pass the string beans.
- We're out of string beans.

18:38.108 --> 18:39.154
We're out of string beans?

18:39.253 --> 18:40.529
And now it begins.

18:40.628 --> 18:42.102
I knew we would run out of string beans.

18:42.201 --> 18:43.346
Excuse me, kind sir?

18:43.445 --> 18:44.918
It's a Cramer family tradition.

18:45.018 --> 18:46.949
First, we never order enough food...

18:47.048 --> 18:48.160
- Three orders of string beans.
- Three?

18:48.259 --> 18:50.158
( Whispers )
...then order too much.

18:50.257 --> 18:51.532
<i>Man: - Sweetie, why three?</i>
<i>Sweetie: - Because they're small.</i>

18:51.632 --> 18:53.235
- I don't want the leftovers.
- They heat up nice.

18:53.334 --> 18:55.527
- Whatever we order, we eat.
<i>- Carl has a guest.</i>

18:55.626 --> 18:57.623
No doggie bags.
If I see one of those tin foil animals,

18:57.722 --> 18:58.868
it goes straight in the trash.

18:58.967 --> 18:59.784
Boo, you'll eat more food, right?

18:59.883 --> 19:01.684
Uh, yes, Mrs. Cramer.

19:01.784 --> 19:03.780
Call me Sweetie.
Everyone calls me Sweetie.

19:03.879 --> 19:05.646
You don't have to call her
anything if you don't want.

19:05.746 --> 19:07.218
<i>One orange chicken,</i>

19:07.317 --> 19:08.625
happy family in a bird's nest.

19:08.724 --> 19:10.427
Find a happy family to eat it, will you?

19:10.526 --> 19:12.129
Scallion pancakes.

19:12.228 --> 19:13.407
Do you like pork, honey?

19:13.506 --> 19:14.684
Yes.

19:14.783 --> 19:16.157
Oh, 'cause I do not.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.435
Neither do I.

19:17.534 --> 19:18.940
Well, which is it?
You like pork or you don't?

19:19.039 --> 19:21.692
Well, I used to like it,

19:21.790 --> 19:23.788
but just now when I said I did,

19:23.887 --> 19:25.751
I was remembering the time that I did...

19:25.851 --> 19:27.454
<i>Like it, but I don't anymore.</i>

19:27.553 --> 19:28.895
Unless someone else
wants some and then I...

19:28.994 --> 19:30.336
Just order the pork, mom.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.678
This is why the whole world hates us.

19:31.777 --> 19:32.890
Nobody hates us.

19:32.990 --> 19:34.987
Mu shu pork.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.329
- And that'll do us?
- That'll do us.

19:36.429 --> 19:37.934
Oh, that'll do us. And them.

19:38.033 --> 19:39.375
And those people over there,

19:39.473 --> 19:40.880
<i>and the waiters in the back</i>
<i>and their families.</i>

19:40.979 --> 19:43.074
- And four blocks in Solvang...
<i>Sweetie: - Just ignore him.</i>

19:43.173 --> 19:44.777
He's having a stroke. Thank you.

19:46.709 --> 19:48.509
So, Boo.

19:48.609 --> 19:50.147
What do you got going on here?

19:50.246 --> 19:52.014
- What is this?
- My face?

19:52.113 --> 19:54.143
- Are you Jewish?
- I could be.

19:54.242 --> 19:55.288
She's not Jewish, mom.

19:55.387 --> 19:57.089
But what is going on there?

19:57.188 --> 19:59.119
I'm seeing a lot of Eastern Europe?

19:59.218 --> 20:00.757
<i>Maybe Poland, Hungary?</i>

20:00.856 --> 20:02.099
Do you like Eastern Europe?

20:02.198 --> 20:03.344
Depends on the era.

20:03.443 --> 20:04.818
Hey, did I tell you about the first

20:04.917 --> 20:06.815
<i>hiking trip I did in Maine?</i>

20:06.914 --> 20:09.107
There was a bunch of us, and we were just
getting to the peak of first ridge...

20:09.206 --> 20:12.283
Carl, I have heard
the story of you and the bear

20:12.382 --> 20:13.495
and the running down the hill.

20:13.594 --> 20:15.197
I do not need to hear
the story of you and the bear

20:15.297 --> 20:16.638
and the running down the hill again.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.407
Neither does your little girlfriend.

20:18.506 --> 20:20.044
Now I am here to get to know her.

20:20.143 --> 20:21.877
Not you. So, Boo,

20:21.976 --> 20:22.860
does your family ski?

20:22.959 --> 20:25.643
Uh... yes.

20:25.742 --> 20:26.626
Really?

20:26.725 --> 20:28.197
God, I hate skiers.

20:28.296 --> 20:29.572
I mean, no.

20:29.671 --> 20:31.308
Oh, really? 'Cause I was gonna say

20:31.407 --> 20:32.946
I hate them because they get to ski.

20:33.045 --> 20:34.517
I would love to ski.

20:34.616 --> 20:37.006
- I never learned how.
- Oh, well, we ski.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.512
And we love it.

20:38.611 --> 20:41.002
I love it. Skiing.

20:41.101 --> 20:42.148
Well then maybe you could teach me.

20:42.247 --> 20:43.325
No.

20:43.424 --> 20:44.373
Okay.

20:44.472 --> 20:46.534
- What did you do?
- Washed my hands.

20:46.633 --> 20:48.729
- You canceled the string beans.
- I don't want leftovers.

20:48.828 --> 20:50.398
Boo wanted those beans, didn't you, Boo?

20:50.498 --> 20:52.102
You know, mom, you probably don't remember

20:52.201 --> 20:54.328
but you've seen Boo at a
couple of my dance recitals.

20:54.428 --> 20:56.424
<i>She was the girl mopping the
floor with the rest of us.</i>

20:56.524 --> 20:58.683
Carl raves about your dancing.

20:58.783 --> 20:59.993
I'm not that good.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.041
She's great.

21:01.140 --> 21:02.547
Who's your favorite ballerina?

21:04.185 --> 21:05.462
She loves a bunch of them.

21:05.561 --> 21:06.902
The list is long.

21:07.001 --> 21:08.410
Is your name Boo?

21:08.509 --> 21:10.145
So who do you like? Gelsey Kirkland?

21:10.244 --> 21:11.061
Yes.

21:11.161 --> 21:13.747
Terrible cocaine problem.

21:13.846 --> 21:14.924
No.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.479
No? She didn't have
a terrible cocaine problem?

21:17.578 --> 21:18.724
Maybe.

21:18.823 --> 21:20.492
She wrote a book...
a whole book about cocaine,

21:20.591 --> 21:23.111
about snorting cocaine,
about quitting cocaine.

21:23.210 --> 21:24.585
Mom, please?

21:24.684 --> 21:26.910
Shush. Now come on, honey,
you're a ballerina,

21:27.009 --> 21:28.646
surely you have a favorite.
Who's your favorite?

21:28.745 --> 21:30.513
( Beeps )
90 minutes.

21:30.612 --> 21:31.658
What?

21:31.758 --> 21:34.081
Time for me to go to the bathroom.

21:34.180 --> 21:36.210
You set an alarm to remind
you to go to the bathroom?

21:36.310 --> 21:37.389
You okay? You need to go home?

21:37.488 --> 21:39.484
- Let me take you home.
- I'm fine.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.679
I'll be right back.

21:42.727 --> 21:44.003
What kind of a person sets an alarm

21:44.102 --> 21:45.575
to remind her to go to the bathroom?

21:45.674 --> 21:47.540
Mom, can you back off?
You're making her nervous.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.308
Oh please, she showed up nervous.

21:49.407 --> 21:50.455
Well, you're not helping.

21:50.554 --> 21:52.354
Carl, this girl, she's very nice.

21:52.453 --> 21:53.662
Don't do this.

21:53.761 --> 21:55.202
She's like a loaf of unbaked bread.

21:55.301 --> 21:56.020
That's not fair.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.461
This woman has no opinions.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.230
- Stop.
- She skis, she doesn't ski.

21:59.329 --> 22:00.868
She's from Poland, she's not from Poland.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.439
She never said she was from Poland

22:02.538 --> 22:03.748
and you don't know her.

22:03.848 --> 22:04.797
But you better get to know her

22:04.897 --> 22:06.107
because she's the one I like.

22:06.206 --> 22:08.072
More than like. I could marry this girl.

22:08.171 --> 22:09.642
Get a good job. She eats a lot of beans.

22:09.742 --> 22:11.476
What are you talking about,
marry this girl?

22:11.575 --> 22:12.688
You're in high school.

22:21.197 --> 22:22.867
What the hell is going on in there?

22:24.181 --> 22:25.459
I'm not talking to myself, dude.

22:25.558 --> 22:27.098
Any idea what's going on in my house?

22:27.198 --> 22:28.672
I have no idea.

22:28.771 --> 22:30.903
Okay, and Sasha's not here, so scram.

22:31.002 --> 22:32.084
Yep.

22:34.807 --> 22:39.167
<i>( Piano playing ) Just a 24-hour turnaround
on all alterations, ladies.</i>

22:39.267 --> 22:42.053
You are running dangerously
low there, Jill.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.235
Oh, well, you know what to do.

22:43.334 --> 22:44.546
- Do I?
- Truly.

22:44.645 --> 22:45.826
<i>Such a charming space.</i>

22:45.925 --> 22:47.498
It's a work in progress,

22:47.597 --> 22:48.778
but it's really getting there.

22:48.877 --> 22:50.057
Sue, that blouse is so you,

22:50.156 --> 22:51.270
I don't want it on anybody else.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.943
<i>- Truly!</i>
<i>- Would you ladies excuse me</i>

22:53.042 --> 22:54.910
for just a moment.

22:56.091 --> 22:57.108
Don't I at least get a glass of wine?

22:57.206 --> 22:58.287
Wine is for customers.

22:58.386 --> 23:00.387
So, did I know about this?

23:00.486 --> 23:02.552
About my fall open house?
I meant to give you a flyer.

23:02.652 --> 23:04.717
Here. On the back is information about

23:04.816 --> 23:06.914
a winter hot chocolate party
I'm hosting in December.

23:07.013 --> 23:08.324
Bring the kids, 'cause there's caroling.

23:08.424 --> 23:09.700
Truly, this is not your shop.

23:09.801 --> 23:11.340
Lucy, I have an Audrey Hepburn hat

23:11.440 --> 23:13.275
that would look sin
city-sational with that skirt.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.473
When are you going to
talk to your landlord?

23:15.573 --> 23:16.851
Mmm, never.

23:16.950 --> 23:19.377
Never? But, Truly, this
thing we got going here,

23:19.476 --> 23:20.656
it's gotta end soon.

23:20.755 --> 23:22.624
Oh, great, I went from
one mean landlord to another?

23:22.723 --> 23:23.869
I'm not your landlord.

23:23.968 --> 23:24.985
- Truly.
- Aah.

23:25.084 --> 23:26.722
How's that size working for you, Nancy?

23:26.821 --> 23:28.296
- It's too big.
- Too big?

23:28.396 --> 23:30.723
Nancy, skinny girl,
you are now officially a six.

23:30.822 --> 23:31.707
- No.
- Yes.

23:31.806 --> 23:32.888
- No.
- Yes.

23:32.987 --> 23:34.135
- No!
- Yes! Nancy, you're a six!

23:34.234 --> 23:35.250
Accept it!

23:35.349 --> 23:37.873
I will get you that six tomorrow, Nancy.

23:37.974 --> 23:40.629
- She's a six.
- Truly.

23:40.728 --> 23:41.940
I mean it here.

23:42.039 --> 23:43.285
Okay.

23:43.384 --> 23:44.596
Okay, I know I need to talk to her,

23:44.695 --> 23:46.367
but she's just so intimidating,

23:46.466 --> 23:48.008
and I hate that scary office of hers.

23:48.107 --> 23:49.647
And if I have to look at
that stupid picture of her

23:49.747 --> 23:51.615
playing golf with Condoleezza
Rice one more time...

23:51.715 --> 23:53.715
Well, how about you meet her
on neutral territory?

23:53.814 --> 23:54.862
Like the Oyster Bar?

23:54.961 --> 23:56.633
- Maybe.
- And I'll go with you

23:56.732 --> 23:58.567
for moral support. How about that?

23:58.667 --> 24:00.043
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Anything to get my place back.</i>

24:00.143 --> 24:02.077
I'm not sure if this is appropriate,

24:02.176 --> 24:03.520
but how much for this?

24:03.619 --> 24:04.306
I'm sorry, but you're right.

24:04.407 --> 24:05.488
That's not appropriate.

24:05.587 --> 24:06.604
I'll take 50 bucks.

24:10.375 --> 24:11.786
What's the matter with you, Boo?

24:11.885 --> 24:13.030
You seem pensive.

24:13.130 --> 24:15.655
Carl is going to ask me to marry him.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.097
What?

24:17.197 --> 24:18.934
How do you know?

24:19.033 --> 24:20.049
I heard him talking to his mom

24:20.149 --> 24:21.820
when I met the parents last night.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.920
Holy crap. This is big.

24:24.019 --> 24:25.100
He's going to have to
wear lifts at the wedding

24:25.200 --> 24:26.412
or else the kiss will look stupid.

24:26.512 --> 24:27.560
So you've had sex with him?

24:27.660 --> 24:29.297
No, Sasha!

24:29.397 --> 24:31.167
If I had, I'd have told you.

24:31.266 --> 24:33.070
Why in the world would you tell me?

24:33.169 --> 24:34.447
Are you forgetting the pact?

24:34.546 --> 24:37.267
The eighth grade pact?

24:37.368 --> 24:38.776
We all vowed to call each other

24:38.875 --> 24:40.088
after it happened.

24:40.188 --> 24:42.319
You vowed to call us while it happened.

24:42.418 --> 24:43.499
That sounds like me.

24:43.599 --> 24:44.941
Boo, whatever that pact was,

24:45.041 --> 24:46.450
it was two and a half years ago.

24:46.550 --> 24:47.631
We were babies.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.009
I was still taller than Melanie.

24:49.108 --> 24:51.239
I thought it was nice,

24:51.338 --> 24:54.027
made it less of a scary thing.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.601
It was nice, Boo.

24:55.701 --> 24:57.404
We'll tell each other, I promise.

24:57.504 --> 24:59.930
What is going on here?

25:01.964 --> 25:03.012
Boo: <i>What is she carrying?</i>

25:03.112 --> 25:04.653
I think it's a picnic basket.

25:05.736 --> 25:07.670
She rode up to school in a scooter.

25:07.769 --> 25:09.573
Where did she get the picnic basket?

25:09.672 --> 25:10.917
And she's wearing a suede dress.

25:11.016 --> 25:12.195
<i>She was not wearing that this morning.</i>

25:12.295 --> 25:14.197
Or this afternoon when she changed.

25:14.296 --> 25:15.836
It's her third outfit.

25:17.543 --> 25:20.230
( Sighs )
Beautiful spread.

25:20.330 --> 25:21.149
That's wine.

25:21.248 --> 25:22.887
<i>I mean, is that legal?</i>

25:22.986 --> 25:24.068
<i>Isn't she 16?</i>

25:24.167 --> 25:25.642
Sasha: <i>Mitch Alvarado.</i>

25:25.742 --> 25:27.217
Melanie: <i>He gave her a peck on the cheek.</i>

25:27.316 --> 25:29.775
How in the world does she
already know Mitch Alvarado?

25:29.874 --> 25:32.660
I've been going to school with
Mitch Alvarado since kindergarten.

25:32.759 --> 25:35.284
I <i>still</i> haven't met Mitch Alvarado.

25:36.564 --> 25:37.974
This is so urban and sophisticated.

25:38.073 --> 25:39.384
I'm gonna puke.

25:40.598 --> 25:42.270
Ginny, we need information.
Go grill the brother.

25:42.369 --> 25:44.336
- Me? Why me?
- Because we voted and you won.

25:44.436 --> 25:46.927
- You didn't vote.
- Who wants Ginny to go talk to the brother?

25:50.699 --> 25:53.159
( Sighs )
All right.

26:03.227 --> 26:04.308
Hello, Virginia.

26:04.408 --> 26:05.883
How did you know my name?

26:05.982 --> 26:06.933
How did you know mine?

26:07.032 --> 26:09.556
How do you know I know your name?

26:09.656 --> 26:11.820
I didn't. I do now.

26:14.149 --> 26:17.625
So, you and your sister.
New kids in town, huh?

26:17.725 --> 26:20.281
'Cause we notice when new people move in.

26:20.380 --> 26:22.643
We're perpetually bored, so...

26:22.742 --> 26:24.479
- This is going in the garbage.
- What is?

26:24.578 --> 26:25.758
This.

26:25.857 --> 26:27.267
I can't quite see...

26:27.366 --> 26:28.775
but you would if I let it survive.

26:28.875 --> 26:31.629
Is that bad, seeing a picture?

26:31.728 --> 26:34.056
<i>Isn't that the point?</i>

26:35.663 --> 26:37.269
So where are you guys from?

26:37.369 --> 26:39.073
We're nomads. We're just in from Bavaria.

26:39.172 --> 26:41.500
Bavaria, really?

26:41.599 --> 26:43.173
That's where mad Ludwig's castle is.

26:43.272 --> 26:45.010
I've always wanted to see that.

26:45.110 --> 26:48.323
The way he saw it, or the way it is?

26:48.421 --> 26:49.994
Uh...

26:50.093 --> 26:51.437
you'll see soon.

26:57.145 --> 26:58.686
That's me. That's us.

27:02.065 --> 27:03.277
It's warmer today than I thought.

27:09.726 --> 27:11.693
Why doesn't my paella look
like the paella in the book?

27:11.696 --> 27:13.237
You should have just kept it simple.

27:13.337 --> 27:14.780
It's just rice, onions,
garlic, sausage, shrimp,

27:14.879 --> 27:16.158
chicken, muscles, and saffron stock.

27:16.257 --> 27:17.142
What's simpler than that?

27:17.242 --> 27:18.455
She's supposed to be on bed rest.

27:18.554 --> 27:19.964
I'm on stool rest. Just as good.

27:20.064 --> 27:21.212
Plus we have a special guest.

27:21.311 --> 27:22.393
I'm not a special guest.

27:22.492 --> 27:23.706
<i>Are you kidding? This is historic.</i>

27:23.806 --> 27:25.282
Boo has never brought a boy home

27:25.381 --> 27:26.529
except when she was six
and she brought home

27:26.629 --> 27:27.743
little Maxie Rucker.

27:27.842 --> 27:29.155
Without informing Maxie's parents.

27:29.254 --> 27:30.795
And they arrested Rusty and me

27:30.895 --> 27:32.371
because we were responsible
for Boo's actions

27:32.471 --> 27:33.585
or something.

27:33.684 --> 27:34.864
It was hysterical.

27:34.963 --> 27:35.914
You kidnapped a kid?

27:36.015 --> 27:37.555
Hey, how about we not bring up anecdotes

27:37.654 --> 27:38.934
from my childhood tonight, okay?

27:39.033 --> 27:40.115
<i>The paella in the book is brown.</i>

27:40.215 --> 27:41.756
Why is mine green?

27:41.855 --> 27:43.168
Please, let's just order pizzas.

27:43.268 --> 27:44.908
No, that's surrendering. Never surrender!

27:45.007 --> 27:46.581
Boys: Never surrender! Never surrender!

27:46.680 --> 27:48.846
( Yelling )

27:48.946 --> 27:51.372
I didn't know Beez would have
his two boobs with him tonight.

27:51.472 --> 27:52.619
We had no choice. When it's my turn

27:52.719 --> 27:53.998
to watch the Winkleburn kids,

27:54.098 --> 27:55.770
then it's my turn to watch
the Winkleburn kids.

27:55.869 --> 27:57.805
Do you boil it inside the pouch,

27:57.905 --> 27:59.709
or do you open the pouch and dump it in?

27:59.808 --> 28:01.481
I think you keep it in the pouch

28:01.580 --> 28:02.827
and drop it in the boiling water.

28:02.926 --> 28:04.632
Thank you, young man.

28:04.731 --> 28:05.878
Rusty, you're watching TV.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.585
- I'm not watching TV.
- Then turn it off.

28:07.684 --> 28:09.718
- The kids will start crying.
- You'll start crying.

28:09.817 --> 28:10.604
Mom, let's get this dinner moving.

28:10.704 --> 28:11.786
We are losing momentum.

28:11.885 --> 28:12.902
Oh, I'll put barbeque sauce on it.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.083
That'll make it brown.

28:14.182 --> 28:15.626
- Yes.
- I love barbeque sauce.

28:15.725 --> 28:16.709
You know, if there's not gonna be enough,

28:16.808 --> 28:18.580
I can just eat down at the firehouse.

28:18.679 --> 28:20.746
Chicken parm night. It's a good night.

28:20.845 --> 28:22.517
Dad, we are having dinner with Carl.

28:22.617 --> 28:23.895
Well, Carl can come with me.

28:23.995 --> 28:25.471
I like Carl.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.703
It's barbequed paella
I'm not too crazy about.

28:27.802 --> 28:31.018
<i>( Crashing )</i>

28:33.120 --> 28:34.595
Did...

28:34.695 --> 28:36.270
did anyone else hear that?

28:36.369 --> 28:37.712
That was just Boo's brother.

28:37.811 --> 28:39.518
And the Winkleburns. They get into it.

28:39.617 --> 28:40.764
They sure do.

28:40.864 --> 28:43.292
There. Brown paella. Dish that up.

28:43.391 --> 28:45.130
I'm gonna pee.

Whoo.

29:30.092 --> 29:32.159
You know, I can't believe
you just whipped up

29:32.258 --> 29:33.472
this dessert, Carl.
What's it called again?

29:33.572 --> 29:34.817
Bananas foster.

29:34.916 --> 29:36.623
It's just bananas, brown sugar, butter,

29:36.722 --> 29:38.297
and vanilla ice cream. It's nothing.

29:38.396 --> 29:40.101
Nothing! I've got Rachel Ray
making me dessert here,

29:40.200 --> 29:41.152
and he says it's nothing.

29:41.251 --> 29:42.267
Rachel Ray is a girl.

29:42.366 --> 29:44.269
Proof. I want proof!
( Laughs )

29:44.369 --> 29:45.287
Hey, mom, where's dad?

29:45.386 --> 29:46.697
He went to the bathroom 20 minutes ago.

29:46.797 --> 29:47.912
I should probably check on him.

29:48.011 --> 29:49.291
Sometimes he's so tired he pulls an Elvis

29:49.391 --> 29:50.800
and falls asleep on the throne.

29:50.900 --> 29:54.148
Let's hope he's not pulling a full Elvis.

29:54.248 --> 29:56.707
Let's help your mother clean up.

30:04.453 --> 30:05.273
You're a saint.

30:05.373 --> 30:06.980
( Scoffs )

30:07.079 --> 30:09.343
The banana foster was really good.

30:09.442 --> 30:10.820
I hope so.

30:10.919 --> 30:11.936
I didn't use quite as much butter

30:12.035 --> 30:13.280
as I'd like. I thought it would be

30:13.380 --> 30:14.593
a good idea to cut off
the part of the cube

30:14.693 --> 30:15.775
that had teeth marks on it.

30:15.875 --> 30:16.891
Yeah.

30:16.991 --> 30:18.400
I can show your mom how to make it.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.042
Your dad was really into it.

30:20.141 --> 30:21.157
Even Beez seemed to...

30:21.257 --> 30:22.274
Okay, I'll marry you.

30:24.671 --> 30:25.589
- What?
<i>- Let's do it.</i>

30:25.688 --> 30:26.672
Let's get married.

30:26.771 --> 30:27.983
The sooner the better.

30:28.082 --> 30:29.230
Married?

30:29.330 --> 30:31.233
I just need to finish
high school first, okay?

30:31.332 --> 30:32.612
And you should too.

30:32.711 --> 30:34.121
Then we'll get married and go to college.

30:34.221 --> 30:35.368
People have done that.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.469
There's special housing
for married couples.

30:37.568 --> 30:39.635
I think I saw that
somewhere in a movie once.

30:39.734 --> 30:41.637
"Love Story." "Porky's."

30:41.736 --> 30:42.621
- Boo.
- <i>And who knows,</i>

30:42.721 --> 30:44.622
after I lose those last few pounds

30:44.721 --> 30:46.264
and get a little more training,

30:46.363 --> 30:48.430
<i>I can make it into a good dance company,</i>

30:48.529 --> 30:49.513
<i>maybe New York.</i>

30:49.612 --> 30:51.285
We'll live in New York.

30:51.385 --> 30:52.499
That's where you'll go to school.

30:52.598 --> 30:54.600
There are some great schools in New York.

30:54.699 --> 30:57.095
Or we could just be engaged
and live in New York

30:57.194 --> 30:58.801
while I'm dancing
and you're going to college,

30:58.900 --> 31:00.966
but that puts me in the why-buy-the-cow...

31:01.066 --> 31:03.001
<i>when-you-can-get-</i>
<i>the-milk-for-free category,</i>

31:03.101 --> 31:05.955
so we're just going to have to
bit the bullet and get married.

31:06.055 --> 31:07.366
Whoa, whoa, Boo...

31:07.465 --> 31:09.401
I know I'm just a loaf
of unbaked bread, Carl,

31:09.500 --> 31:11.043
but I make a good wife.

31:11.142 --> 31:13.405
And a good mother to your children,

31:13.505 --> 31:15.571
if you want children. I'm torn.

31:15.671 --> 31:17.573
If I give birth to the Winkleburn kids,

31:17.672 --> 31:19.246
I am sending them back.

31:19.346 --> 31:20.625
Boo, let me say something.

31:20.725 --> 31:21.938
Okay, but hurry because we have

31:22.037 --> 31:23.448
a lot of planning to do.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.366
Where is this coming from?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.467
I heard you talking to Sweetie.

31:26.566 --> 31:29.651
- Oh, Boo... - Saying that
I'm the girl you're going to marry.

31:29.751 --> 31:31.324
I was touched.

31:31.424 --> 31:32.899
And nauseous,

31:32.999 --> 31:35.065
but mostly touched.

31:35.164 --> 31:36.707
Boo, listen. What I said that night

31:36.805 --> 31:38.085
about us getting married?

31:38.184 --> 31:39.758
I didn't mean it literally.

31:39.857 --> 31:40.939
You didn't?

31:41.040 --> 31:41.924
My mother, I love her,

31:42.024 --> 31:43.632
but she yaps

31:43.731 --> 31:44.878
and doesn't listen.

31:44.978 --> 31:45.994
The only way I can get her to hear me

31:46.094 --> 31:47.537
is to be ridiculously dramatic.

31:47.635 --> 31:50.326
So you don't want to get married.

31:50.426 --> 31:53.379
Well, it's a little early don't you think?

31:53.478 --> 31:54.855
Well, yeah.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.824
Not that I don't think you're
great marriage material,

31:56.925 --> 31:58.925
but I kind of

31:59.025 --> 32:00.763
don't want to miss
my last year of summer camp.

32:00.863 --> 32:02.797
It comes with hot dog privileges.

32:03.881 --> 32:06.079
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:06.179 --> 32:07.786
Yeah.

32:07.885 --> 32:12.577
So, I'm not just a loaf of unbaked bread?

32:12.678 --> 32:15.105
Nah, you're fully baked.

32:17.337 --> 32:19.370
And by the way, you're
dad's not on the throne.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.799
He snuck down to the firehouse
for some chicken parm.

32:21.899 --> 32:24.162
He confided in me man-to-man.

32:24.261 --> 32:25.639
It was cool.

32:25.738 --> 32:26.854
He's even bringing me one back.

32:31.628 --> 32:34.685
( Foot tapping )

32:34.785 --> 32:36.066
Turn off your motor there, Speedy.

32:36.165 --> 32:37.774
My leg always jiggles when I'm nervous.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.418
Just take a deep breath.

32:39.517 --> 32:41.390
My niece isn't even allowed
to sit on my lap anymore.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.461
Not since I catapulted her into a wall.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.172
God, that's her.

32:45.271 --> 32:46.552
Hello, Truly.

32:46.652 --> 32:47.736
Hello, Milly.

32:47.836 --> 32:48.788
This is my friend, Michelle.

32:48.887 --> 32:50.037
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.681
If I had known you were bringing a friend,

32:51.781 --> 32:53.192
- I'd have brought Leonard.
- Who's Leonard?

32:53.291 --> 32:54.474
Leonard's a good friend of mine.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.775
He has a sailboat,
and sometimes we play squash.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.517
He's going to be sorry he missed this.

33:00.656 --> 33:03.317
So, shall we pretend we're
really here for a pleasant lunch

33:03.417 --> 33:05.093
or save ourselves the calories?

33:05.192 --> 33:07.098
We need to talk about the lease.

33:07.197 --> 33:08.281
Sign it and we're good to go.

33:08.381 --> 33:09.957
You raised the rent 40%.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.798
<i>It reflects current market comps.</i>

33:11.898 --> 33:14.987
If I knew what that meant, I'm
sure I would disagree with it.

33:15.086 --> 33:17.156
Milly, I think what truly is wondering

33:17.256 --> 33:19.951
is does the rent increase
need to be that steep?

33:20.050 --> 33:21.267
<i>Well, Michelle,</i>

33:21.366 --> 33:23.304
normally I would defer to Leonard on this,

33:23.404 --> 33:25.769
but I'll have you know that
I'm doing Truly a big favor.

33:25.868 --> 33:27.610
I've got a national lube and tune company

33:27.709 --> 33:28.761
begging me for that space,

33:28.860 --> 33:30.306
<i>and they pay more.</i>

33:30.405 --> 33:31.686
<i>I can't say which company it is,</i>

33:31.786 --> 33:33.527
but you have both gotten lubed there.

33:33.627 --> 33:35.894
Well, what about the improvements

33:35.994 --> 33:37.308
I've made to the space?

33:37.408 --> 33:39.511
A glittery toilet seat
with Barry Gibbs' face on it

33:39.610 --> 33:41.153
does not constitute an improvement.

33:41.253 --> 33:44.769
But maybe we could
find a middle ground here.

33:44.869 --> 33:46.742
Huh? Something that
we could all live with?

33:46.841 --> 33:49.931
Well, if by "we" you mean
you, me, Truly and Leonard,

33:50.031 --> 33:51.904
well, of course I'd have to
consult with Leonard on this,

33:52.003 --> 33:53.317
but no, there is no middle ground.

33:53.417 --> 33:54.599
<i>It's the market rate or nothing.</i>

33:54.699 --> 33:56.769
Milly, I have invested
all of my money into Sparkles.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.708
I can't believe you're willing
to destroy it like this.

33:58.807 --> 34:00.877
Your money? Really?

34:00.977 --> 34:02.785
- Don't start.
- You're gonna pretend it's not mom's money?

34:02.884 --> 34:04.099
So I borrowed money from mom.

34:04.199 --> 34:05.053
- So what?
- Mom?

34:05.152 --> 34:06.631
So she dipped into her 401K

34:06.731 --> 34:07.946
to buy you a bunch of dresses.

34:08.045 --> 34:08.931
She never did anything for me.

34:09.031 --> 34:10.773
Oh, you are so her favorite,

34:10.873 --> 34:11.956
with your fancy holiday parties

34:12.054 --> 34:13.139
and your perfect little daughter.

34:13.239 --> 34:14.322
<i>She's not perfect anymore.</i>

34:14.422 --> 34:15.967
Not since you gave her that concussion.

34:16.065 --> 34:17.411
Hold on a second. Quick question...

34:17.513 --> 34:19.286
- are you two sisters?
- Yes.

34:19.386 --> 34:20.635
Unfortunately.

34:20.734 --> 34:22.245
Why didn't you mention this before?

34:22.344 --> 34:24.185
It wasn't relevant.

34:24.284 --> 34:25.467
You're sisters. It's relevant.

34:25.567 --> 34:26.585
<i>It's because she hates me.</i>

34:26.684 --> 34:27.898
That's why she didn't mention it.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.214
She hates me.

34:29.313 --> 34:30.989
Okay, Truly, go get a soda or something.

34:31.089 --> 34:32.237
Let me talk to Milly for a second.

34:32.338 --> 34:33.455
Really, go.

34:37.728 --> 34:40.556
So... sisters.

34:40.656 --> 34:41.804
It happens.

34:41.904 --> 34:44.335
But it's only happened once to you, Milly.

34:44.435 --> 34:46.275
You have one sweet, special person

34:46.375 --> 34:48.181
you can call sister.

34:48.281 --> 34:50.614
Is it really worth a few lousy bucks

34:50.714 --> 34:51.929
to ruin that?

34:52.029 --> 34:53.344
We have two other sisters.

34:53.443 --> 34:55.775
One's okay. The other one's an actress.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.880
But how can Truly not be your favorite?

34:57.979 --> 34:59.227
She's got so much spunk.

34:59.326 --> 35:01.035
Spunk is what got my Abba CD's turned into

35:01.134 --> 35:02.481
a super-cute prom dress.

35:02.581 --> 35:04.454
But Milly, you're a businesswoman.

35:04.553 --> 35:07.346
Your family relationship
should not affect your business.

35:07.446 --> 35:08.431
Should it?

35:09.681 --> 35:12.147
Well, there's more.

35:12.246 --> 35:14.185
She...

35:14.285 --> 35:15.762
She what?

35:15.862 --> 35:19.377
Look, truly did something
awful to me once.

35:19.478 --> 35:20.857
But concussions heal, don't they?

35:20.958 --> 35:23.159
Oh, who cares about that?
She stole my boyfriend.

35:23.258 --> 35:24.639
Oh, ouch.

35:24.738 --> 35:26.841
<i>And it was a man I cared for very deeply.</i>

35:26.940 --> 35:28.649
And she knew that.

35:28.748 --> 35:29.635
But don't you think it's time

35:29.734 --> 35:31.113
to remove all that from the equation

35:31.212 --> 35:32.823
and just let Truly stay in her shop

35:32.923 --> 35:35.453
that she loves so much?

35:35.552 --> 35:37.096
Forget the past and move on?

35:37.196 --> 35:40.450
But Truly knew that it was leading
to something more serious.

35:40.550 --> 35:43.278
And she went ahead and seduced
Hubbell away from me anyway.

35:43.377 --> 35:45.677
<i>Am I just supposed to</i>
<i>forget about all that?</i>

35:45.777 --> 35:47.386
I'm sorry, did you just say Hubbell?

35:49.622 --> 35:50.904
Do you know who I am?

35:51.003 --> 35:52.975
You're Truly's friend.

35:53.074 --> 35:55.374
I'm Michelle Simms. I married Hubbell.

35:55.475 --> 35:56.657
You're the Madame?

35:56.756 --> 35:57.972
Showgirl.

36:02.443 --> 36:04.249
So...

36:04.350 --> 36:05.763
Do we have a deal?

36:09.741 --> 36:11.942
Truly, <i>mi amigo,</i> we have got
ourselves a game plan.

36:12.042 --> 36:12.995
I get my shop back?

36:13.094 --> 36:14.112
No, you keep using my place

36:14.212 --> 36:15.428
until we figure something else out.

36:15.528 --> 36:16.907
That's our game plan?

36:17.006 --> 36:18.255
That's all we got.
And I'm giving your niece

36:18.353 --> 36:19.503
two years of free tap class

36:19.603 --> 36:22.199
once she gets that protective helmet off.

36:22.298 --> 36:23.842
That woman is rough.

36:26.375 --> 36:29.169
He's a martial arts expert
and a master mechanic.

36:29.268 --> 36:31.569
And she speaks French,
and Spanish, and Japanese,

36:31.667 --> 36:33.212
and Latin, and Farsi and Urdu.

36:33.312 --> 36:34.263
- Come on.
- I heard it from a good source.

36:34.363 --> 36:35.939
Fluent Urdu.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.287
They're definitely the most
popular kids in school.

36:37.388 --> 36:38.800
In just two days? How?

36:38.899 --> 36:40.444
Networking. Multi-lingual networking.

36:40.542 --> 36:42.218
Hey, watch it, rookie.

36:42.319 --> 36:44.257
All the girls are in love with him.

36:44.356 --> 36:45.375
- Really?
- Not me.

36:45.474 --> 36:46.953
And all the guys are in love with her.

36:47.052 --> 36:48.465
Some of the girls too. Not me.

36:48.565 --> 36:50.403
Okay. Stop. Enough about her.

36:50.503 --> 36:52.409
- I agree.
- Let's get inside. We're gonna be late.

39:31.514 --> 39:33.421
( Sighs )

39:39.669 --> 39:41.409
We've got to stop meeting like this.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.184
Or take it to the next step.

39:43.284 --> 39:44.696
Marry, have a couple of kids.

39:44.796 --> 39:46.043
Who bears the children?

39:46.143 --> 39:47.523
How about we alternate?

39:47.623 --> 39:48.740
<i>That'll work.</i>

39:48.839 --> 39:49.956
I thought you had a date tonight.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.699
I ended it early.

39:51.798 --> 39:53.474
Marion was definitely not my type.

39:53.574 --> 39:54.559
You went out with a chick?

39:54.658 --> 39:55.742
It was a guy.

39:55.842 --> 39:57.813
Now for some reason
I feel weirdly compelled

39:57.913 --> 39:59.161
to defend him.

39:59.260 --> 40:00.475
John Wayne's real name was Marion.

40:00.575 --> 40:02.119
And he changed it to John.

40:02.218 --> 40:04.125
True.

40:04.224 --> 40:05.439
Poor Marion.

40:05.539 --> 40:07.544
So, let me guess... you're here rehearsing

40:07.642 --> 40:09.121
the turn, twist, slide, kick

40:09.221 --> 40:10.698
you saw Baryshnikov do in "White Nights"

40:10.798 --> 40:12.080
and you're not leaving till you nail it?

40:12.179 --> 40:13.329
I was meeting Roman.

40:13.429 --> 40:14.512
- Sasha...
- Relax.

40:14.612 --> 40:16.221
- I just canceled it.
- But why here?

40:16.321 --> 40:17.207
Why not your house?

40:17.308 --> 40:20.298
My house is a disaster zone.

40:20.397 --> 40:21.678
There's no way I'm talking him there.

40:21.778 --> 40:23.092
So it's here? In a place that

40:23.192 --> 40:24.440
smells like sweaty tights,

40:24.539 --> 40:26.117
because that'll really
get you in the mood.

40:26.216 --> 40:27.826
It's nothing that calls for mood.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.470
We just want a place to talk and hang

40:29.569 --> 40:30.422
and listen to music.

40:30.522 --> 40:31.441
What about school?

40:31.541 --> 40:32.986
I'm with my friends at school.

40:33.087 --> 40:34.334
Oh, Sasha, you don't know
the first thing about dating.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.437
As soon as you meet a boy,
you dump your friends.

40:36.538 --> 40:37.490
That's what boys are for.

40:37.589 --> 40:38.542
I did not know that.

40:38.643 --> 40:40.876
So you don't need the talk.

40:40.977 --> 40:41.862
The talk?

40:41.963 --> 40:43.210
The talk.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.559
The <i>talk.</i>

40:44.659 --> 40:46.826
No...

40:46.926 --> 40:48.140
But you can give it anyway.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.719
I'd love to hear your version.

40:49.818 --> 40:51.230
Well, it's a good one. You'll never use

40:51.331 --> 40:52.547
a public toilet seat again.

40:52.646 --> 40:54.749
<i>( Footsteps approach )</i>

40:56.821 --> 40:58.168
I told him to abort.

40:58.267 --> 40:59.614
Must have been too late.

41:02.146 --> 41:03.196
It's not Roman.

41:06.813 --> 41:08.095
Are you kidding?

41:08.195 --> 41:10.166
I've been trying to get
a hold of you all day.

41:10.266 --> 41:11.547
- What's up?
<i>- You don't answer texts,</i>

41:11.647 --> 41:12.894
phone calls, e-mails.

41:12.994 --> 41:14.276
I've been driving around.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.623
I finally spotted your car out front.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.727
All those "Rockford Files"
finally paid off.

41:17.826 --> 41:19.535
Enough mouth, Sasha.

41:22.396 --> 41:23.676
You are tough, kid.

41:23.776 --> 41:26.175
Fine. I just thought you'd want to know

41:26.274 --> 41:27.522
he's leaving.

41:27.622 --> 41:29.726
- Who?
- Your dad.

41:29.825 --> 41:31.928
- Again?
- No, not again.

41:32.027 --> 41:34.163
He's really leaving. It's over with us.

41:34.263 --> 41:36.070
Your father has a special someone

41:36.169 --> 41:38.174
<i>and he's moving in with him.</i>

41:38.274 --> 41:41.461
I did not think this was gonna be my life.

41:41.561 --> 41:42.480
Anyway, he's moving out now.

41:42.579 --> 41:43.893
- I'm going next week.
<i>- Going?</i>

41:43.992 --> 41:44.977
Where are you going?

41:45.078 --> 41:46.950
Back to L.A. I miss it.

41:47.050 --> 41:49.384
I miss Encino. Sue me.

41:49.483 --> 41:50.436
Well, what about me?

41:50.535 --> 41:51.587
<i>You have a choice, Sophie.</i>

41:51.685 --> 41:53.657
You could either go with
your dad to San Jose

41:53.756 --> 41:55.104
or you can come with me.

41:55.203 --> 41:57.601
Just let me know quick
so I can make plans.

41:57.700 --> 41:58.916
What about the house?

41:59.016 --> 42:00.100
Oh, I'm dumping that house.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.250
I hate that house.

42:01.351 --> 42:02.696
So that's my choice?

42:02.796 --> 42:03.617
To move away?

42:03.716 --> 42:05.426
- Yes.
- No!

42:05.525 --> 42:06.773
- What?
- I'm not going.

42:06.873 --> 42:09.174
- I'm staying here.
- That is not an option.

42:09.273 --> 42:11.408
My friends are here. My school is here.

42:11.508 --> 42:12.723
My ballet is here.

42:12.823 --> 42:14.399
<i>If I'm going to get into Joffrey,</i>

42:14.499 --> 42:15.912
I can't disrupt my training now.

42:16.011 --> 42:16.866
Forget it.

42:16.965 --> 42:18.739
You're 16, Sasha.

42:18.839 --> 42:20.087
I'm not leaving.

42:23.014 --> 42:25.676
I'm not leaving.
