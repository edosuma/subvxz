00:03.378 --> 00:05.780
What was this,
tuna casserole or potato salad?

00:05.781 --> 00:07.909
Doesn't matter.
It's just stuff in mayonnaise.

00:07.910 --> 00:11.246
It's been three weeks
since Granny Rose's funeral.

00:11.247 --> 00:13.782
Why are people <i>still</i>
<i>giving us casseroles?</i>

00:13.783 --> 00:16.518
And why do people bring
casseroles when somebody dies?

00:16.519 --> 00:17.719
It's actually a practical gift.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.188
When people are grieving,
they don't want to have to cook.

00:20.189 --> 00:22.557
What about when
the casseroles run out?

00:22.558 --> 00:24.760
What if the person who died
is the only one who cooked?

00:24.761 --> 00:26.461
Then we keep telling people
we're grieving

00:26.462 --> 00:28.330
until we figure out
how to feed ourselves.

00:29.866 --> 00:31.967
I just feel bad
it's taken us so long

00:31.968 --> 00:34.069
- to give them their dishes back.
- That's right.

00:34.070 --> 00:35.037
Other people are dying.

00:35.038 --> 00:37.139
And their relatives
are getting casseroles

00:37.140 --> 00:40.275
in plastic Tupperware, so...

00:40.276 --> 00:42.611
It's not like the Grim Reaper
is getting a cup of coffee

00:42.612 --> 00:44.513
while we're piddling around here.

00:45.948 --> 00:48.450
Do we have to keep talking
about death all the time?

00:48.451 --> 00:49.985
Just keeps reminding me of Grandma.

00:49.986 --> 00:52.187
Here. You go rest, hon. I got that.

00:55.091 --> 00:56.358
Hey, thanks.

00:56.359 --> 00:58.493
We could not have held this all
together without you, you know.

00:58.494 --> 00:59.761
Well, that's why I'm here.

00:59.762 --> 01:01.430
I know Roseanne
would want me to step in

01:01.431 --> 01:02.664
and watch over the family.

01:02.665 --> 01:06.134
No, it'd kill her.

01:06.135 --> 01:09.171
But she's already dead, so carry on.

01:10.573 --> 01:13.975
No mother should ever
have to bury her own child.

01:13.976 --> 01:16.478
Mom, you're 92.

01:16.479 --> 01:18.447
You're gonna see all of us die,

01:18.448 --> 01:20.982
and then you're gonna
get buried by a robot.

01:20.983 --> 01:22.684
Hey, everybody.

01:22.685 --> 01:23.852
- Geena!
- Hey!

01:23.853 --> 01:25.420
- Geena!
- Hey!

01:25.421 --> 01:27.122
- Welcome home.
- Hi.

01:27.123 --> 01:29.091
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

01:29.092 --> 01:32.260
The airport in Afghanistan
was under attack for awhile.

01:32.261 --> 01:35.197
Still faster than O'Hare.

01:35.198 --> 01:37.599
This is all just
fruits and vegetables.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.567
If you don't eat right,

01:38.568 --> 01:40.202
your heart can attack you,
like Granny Rose.

01:40.203 --> 01:42.137
Oh, I got to take this.

01:44.207 --> 01:47.209
I just finished cleaning out
Mom's dresser.

01:47.210 --> 01:49.211
Remember how
she was always complaining

01:49.212 --> 01:51.379
that she didn't have
any necklaces to wear?

01:51.380 --> 01:53.215
Here they are.

01:55.218 --> 01:56.685
Dad?

01:56.686 --> 01:59.287
You got to start sleeping in your bed.

01:59.288 --> 02:01.490
Sleeping on the couch every
night's bad for your back.

02:01.491 --> 02:03.825
I just dozed off watching TV.

02:03.826 --> 02:05.894
Not the end of the world.

02:05.895 --> 02:08.395
I read an article
in the dermatologist's office

02:08.396 --> 02:09.830
that said it's very common

02:09.832 --> 02:12.234
for people not to want
to sleep in a bed

02:12.235 --> 02:14.569
that someone died in.

02:14.570 --> 02:16.271
Fascinating.

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
About that...

02:18.841 --> 02:22.711
you ever read anything
that anyone wants to hear?

02:22.712 --> 02:25.947
No. Usually not, no.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.151
Geena, how long before
you have to go back

02:29.152 --> 02:30.051
to Afghanistan?

02:30.052 --> 02:32.320
Oh, they only give you
a five-day leave

02:32.321 --> 02:33.655
for the death of a loved one.

02:33.656 --> 02:35.524
Aunt Darlene says that Granny Rose

02:35.525 --> 02:37.259
might come back as a bird
or a grasshopper.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.894
That's really sweet.

02:38.895 --> 02:42.063
But I think Aunt Darlene
should put away her yoga pants

02:42.064 --> 02:43.898
and pick up a Bible.

02:45.101 --> 02:48.103
Uh, not that crazy, really.
Just reincarnation.

02:48.104 --> 02:50.739
Only about a billion people
believe in it.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.741
Well, you better make
your reservation in Hell, then,

02:52.742 --> 02:54.843
'cause it's gonna be crowded.

02:54.844 --> 02:57.779
Reservation? We already have a cabana.

02:59.549 --> 03:02.117
Dan, can I talk to you for a minute?

03:08.090 --> 03:11.626
I just got a call from a friend
in the coroner's office.

03:11.627 --> 03:14.429
The autopsy found
that it wasn't a heart attack.

03:14.430 --> 03:17.766
Roseanne O.D.'d on opioids.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.901
Not possible.

03:19.902 --> 03:21.069
We knew she had a problem.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.772
She was only on pain pills
for two days after surgery.

03:23.773 --> 03:25.473
Then it was just ibuprofen.

03:25.474 --> 03:27.242
It's got to be wrong.

03:27.243 --> 03:30.278
Well, I wish it was,
but they think that

03:30.279 --> 03:32.447
she must've taken the pills
right before bed,

03:32.448 --> 03:34.249
and with her health issues,

03:34.250 --> 03:37.118
it was enough to stop her breathing.

03:37.119 --> 03:38.987
Wait, what?

03:38.988 --> 03:40.155
Mom overdosed?

03:40.156 --> 03:43.291
That doesn't make any sense.

03:43.292 --> 03:45.760
I got her knees fixed.

03:45.761 --> 03:47.596
I flushed all her pills.

03:47.597 --> 03:50.131
Oh, my God.

03:50.132 --> 03:52.334
I found these pills in Mom's closet.

03:56.505 --> 03:59.741
Well, these aren't even
prescribed to her.

03:59.742 --> 04:02.677
She got them from Marcy Bellinger.

04:07.316 --> 04:09.451
Damn.

04:09.452 --> 04:13.021
That's the only thing
from Mom's closet that I wanted.

04:20.142 --> 04:22.857
I cannot believe how
far past due they are

04:22.858 --> 04:24.458
on some of these.

04:24.459 --> 04:26.092
Maybe we should just
tell the bill collectors

04:26.093 --> 04:27.760
that Mom died.

04:27.761 --> 04:29.428
Don't you remember
Mom used that herself

04:29.429 --> 04:33.199
like five times?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.367
Yeah, but I feel like

04:34.368 --> 04:37.036
we could really sell it this time.

04:41.375 --> 04:42.842
Are we horrible for laughing?

04:42.843 --> 04:46.278
Well, I'm tired of crying.

04:46.279 --> 04:47.647
And laughing inappropriately

04:47.648 --> 04:50.016
is what Mom taught us to do.

04:50.017 --> 04:53.519
I still can't believe she O.D.'d.

04:56.123 --> 04:58.190
You know what?
I can't do bills right now.

04:58.191 --> 05:02.228
I got to finish my split shift
at the restaurant.

05:02.229 --> 05:04.130
Well, all right,
but we got to get this done,

05:04.131 --> 05:05.965
so let's pick it up Friday night.

05:05.966 --> 05:07.533
I can't. I have a date.

05:07.534 --> 05:09.535
Okay, fine. Saturday morning.

05:09.536 --> 05:13.506
I just told you
I have a date on Friday night.

05:13.507 --> 05:17.510
Becky, you can't stay vertical
for one more day?

05:17.511 --> 05:20.246
Look, maybe you can handle this.

05:20.247 --> 05:22.048
I can't.

05:22.049 --> 05:23.516
I went through it when Mark died.

05:23.517 --> 05:24.750
I don't want to do it again.

05:24.751 --> 05:26.085
You're not gonna just dump

05:26.086 --> 05:28.087
all of Mom and Dad's stuff
on me, okay?

05:28.088 --> 05:29.321
I've got two kids.
I've got a full-time job.

05:29.322 --> 05:30.322
No.

05:30.323 --> 05:33.092
You're the obvious choice
to take over for Mom.

05:33.093 --> 05:33.893
You already live here,

05:33.894 --> 05:36.128
and you're a scary, little tyrant.

05:37.831 --> 05:40.032
You're just gonna compliment me
and walk out?

05:42.369 --> 05:43.369
You're right.

05:43.370 --> 05:44.704
I'm gonna get my phone

05:44.705 --> 05:46.338
and find someone to cover my shift.

05:46.339 --> 05:47.640
I'm gonna do what's right.

05:50.577 --> 05:53.079
You're too trusting!
You might want to work on that!

05:56.349 --> 05:58.551
Hey, you and Aunt Becky
need to make up.

05:58.552 --> 06:01.854
What if she died and the last
thing you ever did was fight?

06:01.855 --> 06:03.789
Oh, hey.

06:03.790 --> 06:04.657
Are you thinking about

06:04.658 --> 06:06.258
how you and Granny Rose fought a lot

06:06.259 --> 06:07.793
before she died?

06:07.794 --> 06:09.628
Kinda.

06:09.629 --> 06:11.230
You know, families fight,

06:11.231 --> 06:14.100
but we know that
we always love each other.

06:14.101 --> 06:16.135
And, plus, it's in all those letters

06:16.136 --> 06:18.270
that Granny Rose left each one of us.

06:18.271 --> 06:20.372
Granny Rose wrote everyone a letter?

06:20.373 --> 06:22.975
Oh, God. Maybe not everyone.

06:24.945 --> 06:26.445
You suck!

06:28.281 --> 06:31.584
I might die tomorrow. Don't be mean.

06:35.989 --> 06:37.223
What are you doing?

06:37.224 --> 06:38.758
Huh? Um...

06:39.593 --> 06:42.228
Roseanne always wanted to do this,

06:42.229 --> 06:46.132
and so I thought that with all the
company that we've had recently

06:46.133 --> 06:50.002
and the prior 40 years
of unattended filth,

06:50.003 --> 06:55.341
um, this would be a good time
to fulfill her dream.

06:55.342 --> 06:57.610
Uh, when will it be dry?

06:57.611 --> 07:00.913
I was gonna zone out
in front of the TV for a bit.

07:00.914 --> 07:03.082
Uh, it takes, uh, three to five days.

07:05.085 --> 07:06.418
I thought about what I said,

07:06.419 --> 07:11.190
and I realized it was
insulting and dismissive.

07:11.191 --> 07:12.992
I see that now,

07:12.993 --> 07:15.294
because I need a ride to work.

07:15.295 --> 07:18.831
â™ª

07:18.832 --> 07:22.001
Sorry for your loss.
It's on the house.

07:22.002 --> 07:23.035
I appreciate it.

07:23.036 --> 07:28.107
Um, does your sympathy extend
to close friends?

07:28.108 --> 07:30.209
No.

07:32.212 --> 07:34.146
This is domestic.

07:34.147 --> 07:35.848
My loss is deeper than that.

07:35.849 --> 07:38.083
I think it goes
all the way to Germany.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.187
You got it.

07:41.188 --> 07:42.321
Dad?

07:43.456 --> 07:45.024
What is this?

07:46.193 --> 07:47.793
What's it look like?

07:47.794 --> 07:49.361
It looks like a lawsuit.

07:49.362 --> 07:50.830
You can't do this.

07:50.831 --> 07:52.398
I-I just took it off
the side of your truck.

07:52.399 --> 07:53.165
People are taking pictures.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.701
That's the point. Put it back.

07:55.702 --> 07:57.203
Look, I know that you're upset,

07:57.204 --> 07:58.204
but this isn't gonna help.

07:58.205 --> 07:59.972
It's helping me.

07:59.973 --> 08:01.841
Now, I can either do this

08:01.842 --> 08:03.576
or drive my truck through her house.

08:03.577 --> 08:05.010
Don't.

08:05.011 --> 08:06.212
My boyfriend did that,

08:06.213 --> 08:09.548
and he's having so much trouble
getting his license back.

08:16.990 --> 08:20.392
Thank you. Let's go, Chuck.

08:20.393 --> 08:23.062
The, um,
"truck through the house" thing,

08:23.063 --> 08:25.531
that's just an expression, right?

08:28.201 --> 08:30.603
â™ª

08:30.604 --> 08:32.171
Grandpa, this is Enrique and Joey.

08:32.172 --> 08:33.606
Hello, men.

08:33.607 --> 08:35.107
Listen, you guys can play in here.

08:35.107 --> 08:36.241
I got stuff to do in the garage.

08:36.243 --> 08:37.275
You don't have to go.

08:37.277 --> 08:39.445
They're leaving
'cause they have to do homework.

08:39.446 --> 08:41.413
They just came in to get a drink.

08:41.414 --> 08:43.249
Really sorry to hear about
your wife, Mr. Conner.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.082
Thank you, son.

08:44.083 --> 08:46.185
People die. What are you gonna do?

08:49.122 --> 08:51.724
Seen a little too much action
in Nam, Joey?

08:54.194 --> 08:55.928
See you tomorrow.

08:57.797 --> 08:59.965
Hey, that's our cup.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.335
All right.

09:09.142 --> 09:10.709
I'll be out in the garage, buddy.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.144
Okay.

09:12.145 --> 09:14.280
Can I ask you something first?

09:14.281 --> 09:16.215
Sure, if it's quick.

09:16.216 --> 09:17.716
Granny Rose and I were talking about

09:17.717 --> 09:19.251
this field trip I'm going on Friday,

09:19.252 --> 09:20.986
and we never got to finish.

09:20.987 --> 09:23.222
There's these two kids who want me
to sit next to them on the bus,

09:23.223 --> 09:25.824
and she was gonna help me
figure out who to pick,

09:25.825 --> 09:28.160
'cause whoever I sit next to,

09:28.161 --> 09:30.596
it kind of means I like them.

09:30.597 --> 09:32.831
This doesn't sound quick.

09:36.236 --> 09:38.137
Are any of them boys?

09:38.138 --> 09:40.973
Yeah... Enrique and Joey.

09:40.974 --> 09:43.776
Would you like to talk
about death some more?

09:46.680 --> 09:48.614
I just need to make
a decision right away.

09:48.615 --> 09:50.149
It's really important.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.850
I got to be honest with you, pal.

09:51.851 --> 09:53.519
There's a reason that
your mom and Aunt Becky

09:53.520 --> 09:55.454
went to Grandma for all this stuff.

09:55.455 --> 09:58.123
It's a measure of
my deep affection for you

09:58.124 --> 10:00.626
that I haven't run
out of the room already.

10:04.164 --> 10:05.464
Grandpa Dan?

10:05.465 --> 10:07.299
Yeah?

10:07.300 --> 10:09.034
Did you ever like a boy?

10:10.303 --> 10:12.104
No.

10:12.105 --> 10:14.440
Does it bother you that I do?

10:14.441 --> 10:17.209
No!

10:17.210 --> 10:20.145
I was kind of waiting for you
to tell me about it.

10:20.146 --> 10:23.182
Sorry I took so long.

10:23.183 --> 10:25.417
Okay, don't let it happen again.

10:26.987 --> 10:31.023
â™ª

10:35.729 --> 10:37.463
I hope everyone is enjoying the movie.

10:37.464 --> 10:39.865
I'm having a blast
sitting on this hard chair,

10:39.866 --> 10:41.467
paying bills on a plastic tray

10:41.468 --> 10:44.169
stolen from Hometown Buffet.

10:44.170 --> 10:46.630
At least you don't have a wet
ass from sitting on the couch.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.242
Oh, did I forget to tell you
Aunt Jackie washed the couch?

10:50.243 --> 10:52.211
Oops.

10:52.212 --> 10:54.313
You could've told me.

10:54.314 --> 10:55.714
Yes, I could have.

10:57.584 --> 10:59.351
I'm gonna go get some more coffee.

10:59.352 --> 11:00.519
Anybody?

11:00.520 --> 11:02.121
I'll go with you.

11:05.191 --> 11:07.759
Don't touch anything.
I've got a system.

11:09.596 --> 11:11.096
What are you doing?

11:11.097 --> 11:12.498
I am making life easier,

11:12.499 --> 11:15.000
with a kitchen work-triangle concept

11:15.001 --> 11:16.068
that I saw on TV.

11:16.069 --> 11:18.170
So, the flow should be

11:18.171 --> 11:21.540
from the refrigerator
to the stove to the sink.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.442
Therefore, the coffee maker,

11:23.443 --> 11:25.878
which needs milk from the fridge,

11:25.879 --> 11:28.013
coffee from a canister
next to the stove,

11:28.014 --> 11:29.548
and water from the sink,

11:29.549 --> 11:33.452
should be in the geometric heart
of the triangle,

11:33.453 --> 11:35.287
which is...

11:35.288 --> 11:37.923
right here.

11:42.028 --> 11:44.229
Where do we plug it in?

11:44.230 --> 11:47.199
Yeah. Yeah.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.234
Um...

11:49.235 --> 11:54.306
I will go into the basement.

11:54.307 --> 11:58.310
I will drill a hole
through the kitchen floor,

11:58.311 --> 11:59.945
install a decorative pipe,

11:59.946 --> 12:02.948
which we can paint to match
the ceiling or the floor,

12:02.949 --> 12:04.950
run a cable up through the pipe,

12:04.951 --> 12:06.919
drill a hole through the center
of the kitchen table,

12:06.920 --> 12:08.287
install an outlet.

12:08.288 --> 12:10.589
Bam! We're making coffee!

12:16.429 --> 12:20.299
I think you've had enough coffee.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.300
Uh, you know what?

12:21.301 --> 12:23.235
Um, why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

12:23.236 --> 12:24.303
- I'm gonna need you for the long haul.
- Hmm?

12:24.304 --> 12:26.105
No! No, I'm fine.

12:26.106 --> 12:27.306
I mean, I've got the time right now

12:27.307 --> 12:28.574
to do these things for you.

12:28.575 --> 12:30.476
I just need to finish.

12:30.477 --> 12:31.977
Yeah, you've done so much already.

12:31.978 --> 12:34.012
I mean, we can't sit on
the couch or use the kitchen.

12:34.013 --> 12:35.314
I think that's a pretty good start.

12:35.315 --> 12:37.483
Mm-hmm.

12:37.484 --> 12:38.750
Oh.

12:40.153 --> 12:41.787
Oh.

12:44.657 --> 12:46.125
Where did these come from?

12:46.126 --> 12:48.427
Yeah, I found them in
an ice pack in the freezer.

12:48.428 --> 12:51.130
God. So Mom was just
hiding pills all over?

12:51.131 --> 12:52.331
Yeah. I knew you'd be upset.

12:52.332 --> 12:53.665
I was gonna throw them away,

12:53.666 --> 12:56.702
but I forgot where I put
the trash can 'cause...

12:56.703 --> 12:59.438
I mean, once something gets
outside the triangle,

12:59.439 --> 13:02.007
it's... it's... I mean...

13:08.548 --> 13:09.815
Can I help you?

13:09.816 --> 13:11.783
I'm Marcy Bellinger.

13:11.784 --> 13:14.219
Can I speak with Dan Conner, please?

13:14.220 --> 13:16.555
I got this.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.562
You got a hell of a
lot of nerve showing up here.

13:23.563 --> 13:28.000
Please take that sign
off of your truck.

13:28.001 --> 13:29.001
No.

13:29.002 --> 13:31.403
Everybody's seen it already.

13:31.404 --> 13:33.338
You made your point.

13:33.339 --> 13:35.107
They all hate me.

13:36.576 --> 13:38.043
I can't eat.

13:38.044 --> 13:40.712
I'm drinking myself to sleep.

13:40.713 --> 13:42.848
I have to live with this
for the rest of my life.

13:42.849 --> 13:44.583
Isn't that enough for you?

13:44.584 --> 13:47.819
My wife's gone. What do you think?

13:47.820 --> 13:51.423
Nobody can afford their meds.
We all help each other.

13:51.424 --> 13:54.927
When Sally Benson needed LIPITOR

13:54.928 --> 13:57.596
for her husband's cholesterol,

13:57.597 --> 13:59.531
they got some from Maria Ramirez,

13:59.532 --> 14:00.399
and they gave her

14:00.400 --> 14:02.868
the anxiety meds
she needed for her son

14:02.869 --> 14:05.504
because they dropped her insurance.

14:05.505 --> 14:08.540
Rosie needed painkillers.

14:08.541 --> 14:11.543
I had some, so I gave them to her.

14:11.544 --> 14:13.045
So?

14:13.046 --> 14:14.780
You're part of
a neighborhood drug ring.

14:14.781 --> 14:16.215
Congratulations to you!

14:16.216 --> 14:17.716
You know what, Dan?

14:17.717 --> 14:20.586
You can judge. But Roseanne called me.

14:20.587 --> 14:24.389
She told me that her knee
wasn't healing up fast enough

14:24.390 --> 14:26.592
and I was the only person
she could turn to.

14:26.593 --> 14:28.860
She said that
she needed those pain pills

14:28.861 --> 14:31.430
to get back to work 'cause you
guys were running out of money.

14:31.431 --> 14:34.032
Don't you try to put this off on me.

14:34.033 --> 14:36.235
You gave her the pills. She took them.

14:36.236 --> 14:37.636
She died! You killed her!

14:37.637 --> 14:38.637
Dad, stop.

14:38.638 --> 14:40.872
We just found another stash
in the freezer.

14:40.873 --> 14:42.474
It's not just Marcy.

14:43.443 --> 14:46.111
Mom was getting pills
from lots of people.

14:50.283 --> 14:52.584
I never would have given them to her

14:52.585 --> 14:56.488
if I knew she had a problem.

14:56.489 --> 15:01.293
I know what it's like to...
to have that problem, so...

15:01.294 --> 15:03.028
I just...

15:04.597 --> 15:06.531
I'm sorry.

15:10.403 --> 15:12.471
Darlene, can you drive Marcy home?

15:12.472 --> 15:13.772
Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.074

15:29.168 --> 15:30.201
You okay?

15:30.202 --> 15:31.336
I don't know.

15:31.337 --> 15:34.072
Who am I supposed to be mad at now?

15:34.073 --> 15:37.089
I thought Marcy Bellinger
was a pretty good choice,

15:37.090 --> 15:37.924
until she ruined it

15:37.925 --> 15:40.660
by being all sad and human and stuff.

15:40.661 --> 15:42.328
How are you doing?

15:45.232 --> 15:47.166
Wish I would've known, you know?

15:47.167 --> 15:49.735
It wouldn't have mattered, baby.

15:49.736 --> 15:51.904
She was gonna do
what she was gonna do.

15:51.905 --> 15:54.474
She never listened
to a damn person in her life.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.343
Well, she should've, you know?

15:57.344 --> 16:00.179
'Cause I still need her.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.248
I just want to call her and say,

16:02.249 --> 16:04.417
"How am I supposed to do all this?"

16:04.418 --> 16:08.020
Your mother once told me
that everything you needed,

16:08.021 --> 16:10.356
she gave to you before you were 5.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.859
I have no idea what that means.

16:14.761 --> 16:17.964
Yeah, I never could
figure it out, either.

16:17.965 --> 16:20.700
Think it's something
she got off a Snapple cap.

16:24.304 --> 16:26.672
Man, she was stubborn.

16:26.673 --> 16:29.275
You know, I couldn't even
get her to close her robe

16:29.276 --> 16:31.844
when she'd go out to get
the paper in the morning,

16:31.845 --> 16:34.246
and it was the neighbor's paper.

16:35.115 --> 16:37.116
You know what?

16:37.117 --> 16:38.150
The hell with it.

16:38.151 --> 16:39.619
I'm still gonna blame Marcy.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.621
Your mom would be proud of you.

16:41.622 --> 16:44.924
â™ª

16:49.696 --> 16:52.231
There's no place for the corn holders.

16:52.232 --> 16:56.035
They're not cooking tools.
They're not utensils.

16:56.036 --> 16:57.737
I tried putting them
with the jello molds.

16:57.738 --> 17:00.172
That made no damn sense.

17:02.075 --> 17:04.877
It's okay, Aunt Jackie.

17:04.877 --> 17:06.412
I just wanted to step in, you know?

17:06.413 --> 17:07.512
I just wanted to step in

17:07.513 --> 17:09.248
and pick up where Roseanne left off

17:09.249 --> 17:10.683
and give you guys
everything that you need,

17:10.684 --> 17:12.318
but I'm just looking for things to do.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.185
I'm packing and unpacking drawers.

17:14.186 --> 17:16.556
Nothing belongs anywhere.

17:17.758 --> 17:21.160
I don't even know where I belong.

17:21.161 --> 17:23.863
I...
I don't want to go home.

17:24.998 --> 17:26.531
I don't want
to leave this house,

17:26.532 --> 17:28.367
'cause... 'cause I...

17:28.367 --> 17:30.336
I don't want to leave her.

17:32.172 --> 17:35.307
It's okay. It's okay, Aunt Jackie.

17:36.343 --> 17:37.343
You know what?

17:37.344 --> 17:39.545
It's hard for all of us,

17:39.546 --> 17:41.547
and you're just exhausted.

17:41.548 --> 17:43.849
You just go home, okay?

17:43.850 --> 17:46.118
You come back tomorrow,

17:46.119 --> 17:47.453
and she'll still be here.

17:47.454 --> 17:49.188
Okay?

17:49.189 --> 17:51.524
Yeah, but... but you need help.

17:51.525 --> 17:53.526
Oh, I'll be fine, you know.

17:53.527 --> 17:55.261
And if you need anything tonight,

17:55.262 --> 17:56.462
you just call me, okay?

17:56.463 --> 17:57.463
Anytime.

17:57.464 --> 17:58.531
Okay.

17:58.532 --> 18:00.666
'Cause I just want to make sure
that you're okay.

18:02.369 --> 18:03.436
It hurts.

18:03.437 --> 18:05.137
I know, hon.

18:05.138 --> 18:06.706
It's gonna hurt for a quite a while.

18:06.707 --> 18:08.641
No, corn holders in my shoulder.

18:08.642 --> 18:10.643
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

18:10.644 --> 18:12.278
Sorry.

18:13.747 --> 18:15.481
Yeah.

18:15.482 --> 18:16.549
Okay.

18:17.751 --> 18:19.218
So...

18:19.219 --> 18:20.820
I think I should go home.

18:20.821 --> 18:22.254
Yeah, you know,

18:22.255 --> 18:24.290
D.J. took Grandma Bev home
a while ago.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.058
She's probably worried about you.

18:26.059 --> 18:28.661
Well, that's never really been
my experience.

18:32.499 --> 18:35.234
â™ª

18:35.235 --> 18:37.236
Yo, Junior, come here.

18:37.237 --> 18:39.238
What's up, Grandpa?

18:39.239 --> 18:41.340
Listen, my head
wasn't in the game before,

18:41.341 --> 18:43.175
but now I'm gonna help you.

18:43.176 --> 18:44.010
What's this?

18:44.011 --> 18:46.178
We're gonna list the best qualities

18:46.179 --> 18:48.447
of the two guys you're
considering as a seat mate

18:48.448 --> 18:49.915
and compare.

18:49.916 --> 18:52.018
Joey, Enrique.

18:52.019 --> 18:54.186
Fill in the blanks.

18:54.187 --> 18:56.088
"Joey is..."

18:56.089 --> 18:59.959
Mostly depressed
and kind of sarcastic.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.862
"I like him because he..."

19:02.863 --> 19:05.164
Wears black all the time.

19:05.165 --> 19:07.767
I see a pattern emerging here.

19:07.768 --> 19:10.002
Okay.

19:10.003 --> 19:11.971
Same list for Enrique.

19:11.972 --> 19:14.507
Sweet and funny, a robotics champ.

19:14.508 --> 19:16.175
He's always fun.

19:16.176 --> 19:19.111
Does his family have money?

19:19.112 --> 19:20.079
I don't know.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.815
They go on vacation
and come back with tans.

19:22.816 --> 19:25.384
Florida people. I love it.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.355
Thank you, Grandpa.
This really helped.

19:29.356 --> 19:31.023
Who's it gonna be?

19:31.024 --> 19:32.158
I like Joey.

19:32.159 --> 19:33.726
Joey? Are you crazy?!

19:33.727 --> 19:35.461
Enrique's a keeper!

19:35.462 --> 19:37.863
You don't leave
an Enrique on the table

19:37.864 --> 19:39.532
when he's available.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.534
Still like Joey.

19:41.535 --> 19:43.035
What's going on?

19:43.036 --> 19:44.403
Grandpa helped me pick a seat partner

19:44.404 --> 19:45.204
for the field trip.

19:45.205 --> 19:47.306
He picked the dark, brooding one.

19:47.307 --> 19:48.808
Ah, point for my team.

19:48.809 --> 19:51.043
Trust me, Mark,

19:51.044 --> 19:54.413
being around dark and brooding
gets old real quick.

19:54.414 --> 19:56.415
Uh, how about growing up
with a drama queen

19:56.416 --> 19:59.051
that thinks she's all that
because she got boobs first?

20:00.320 --> 20:02.354
Who got boobs <i>at all.</i>

20:04.658 --> 20:06.225
How about having two older sisters

20:06.226 --> 20:07.660
who suck all the air out of the room

20:07.661 --> 20:09.729
until you're practically invisible?

20:09.730 --> 20:12.164
Becky, did you hear something?

20:12.165 --> 20:13.666
No.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.601
Harris, you hear anything?

20:15.602 --> 20:17.382
Don't drag me
into your weird mind games.

20:18.872 --> 20:21.440
Has anybody even noticed
how much better the flow is

20:21.441 --> 20:24.009
between the refrigerator and the sink?

20:24.010 --> 20:25.678
I'm glad you called that
to my attention.

20:25.679 --> 20:26.846
I'll look now.

20:26.847 --> 20:28.013
Anybody?

20:28.014 --> 20:29.548
- Did you notice it?
- I did, actually.

20:32.252 --> 20:40.351
