No, i-it's not
what you're suggesting.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.934
She's the wife
of a client, okay?

25:00.977 --> 25:03.284
Oh, I see, so now you're
seducing your clients' wives?

25:03.327 --> 25:05.199
Yeah, that's-that's different.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.593
No, I'm not seducing her,
I'm helping her.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.986
Her husband hired me
to track her down. It turns out,

25:10.030 --> 25:11.988
she has a really good reason
to bail on him.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.555
Oh, really? And what is it?

25:13.599 --> 25:15.122
Well, he has ties
to organized crime

25:15.165 --> 25:17.385
and he may have killed
his first wife.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.214
I see.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.955
Well, why haven't
you taken

25:21.998 --> 25:23.696
this information
to the police, then?

25:23.739 --> 25:25.785
Because I don't have
any hard evidence yet.

25:25.828 --> 25:28.483
I mean, I've been digging into
his first wife's disappearance,

25:28.527 --> 25:31.791
and I just can't find anything
to tie him to it.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.662
Coming up empty.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.535
You know,
being a P.I. is...

25:36.578 --> 25:39.015
it's not as easy
as you would think.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.974
Life rarely is.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.019
Yeah.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.978
Well, y-you don't have
to worry about Kiana.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.502
She's only gonna be here until I
can find somewhere safe for her.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.851
So...

25:48.895 --> 25:50.679
how about that bottle?

25:50.723 --> 25:51.680
No.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.248
But, uh,

25:54.291 --> 25:56.511
there's an open bottle
of Madeira in the kitchen

25:56.555 --> 25:58.339
that you're welcome to.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.514
It's the least I can do
for someone

25:59.558 --> 26:01.734
who's been through what she has.

26:02.735 --> 26:03.910
Appreciate it.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.260
Hey, uh...

26:07.914 --> 26:11.439
Have you considered
a slightly different approach?

26:13.397 --> 26:14.834
What do you mean?

26:14.877 --> 26:17.532
Well, if you can't prove
this man's connection

26:17.576 --> 26:20.840
to his wife's murder, then maybe
you could find evidence

26:20.883 --> 26:22.537
to connect him
to his other crimes.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.191
I mean, if he's in prison,

26:24.234 --> 26:26.280
then her problem's
solved, right?

26:32.808 --> 26:35.202
How was the reunion
with you and Hamler?

26:35.245 --> 26:36.464
You guys
all caught up?

26:36.507 --> 26:37.639
Yeah, you could say that.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.121
So, you gonna tell us
how you sent this guy away?

26:41.164 --> 26:42.862
Yeah, well,
it took some digging,

26:42.905 --> 26:44.777
but I eventually found out
Hamler was laundering money

26:44.820 --> 26:46.692
for organized crime
here on the island.

26:46.735 --> 26:49.216
I sent that evidence
to the FBI,

26:49.259 --> 26:50.652
anonymously, of course,

26:50.696 --> 26:52.611
and a couple days later,
he was arrested.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.439
I guess it wasn't as anonymous
as you thought.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.486
Buddy.

26:58.529 --> 26:59.748
What's going on?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.710
I could've just bought Kiana
a ticket off the island

27:04.753 --> 27:05.885
and wished her luck.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.061
Okay, no.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.497
"No" what?

27:09.540 --> 27:11.325
Come on, bro,
this is not your fault.

27:11.368 --> 27:12.979
Y-You don't know that.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.720
I-I mean, I went after Hamler
without considering

27:14.763 --> 27:16.330
there could be blowback
for it down the road.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.898
Not just for myself but
for people in my life.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.465
I didn't have to turn
that evidence in.

27:21.509 --> 27:24.730
I could've used it as leverage
against Hamler,

27:24.773 --> 27:26.949
told him if he didn't
leave Kiana alone,

27:26.993 --> 27:28.516
that I would turn it
into the authorities. I...

27:28.559 --> 27:30.953
Listen to me, man.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.477
You got three years' experience
doing this job now.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.262
You've grown.

27:35.305 --> 27:36.698
But what hasn't
changed, though,

27:36.742 --> 27:38.221
is you being the kind of man

27:38.265 --> 27:40.136
that always tries
to do the right thing.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.704
Any other P.I would take
the money from Hamler

27:42.748 --> 27:44.227
and decide that it was
none of their business.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.751
That's not who you are.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.666
Look, you did the best
that you could back then,

27:47.709 --> 27:49.972
and we're doing the best
that we can right now.

27:50.016 --> 27:53.323
He's right. Hey, Higgins
is gonna be all right.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.716
We're gonna get her back.

27:56.109 --> 27:59.460
I got to be honest,
guys, this...

27:59.503 --> 28:01.114
could go wrong a dozen ways.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.768
And if it does
and the cops find out

28:02.811 --> 28:04.160
we sprung Hamler,
that's prison time.

28:04.204 --> 28:06.119
For all of us.

28:06.162 --> 28:09.862
Well, at least we'll be spending
our sentences together.

28:09.905 --> 28:10.950
Won't be the first time.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.429
You got that right.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.692
[knocking on door]

28:17.086 --> 28:19.175
We could have a problem.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.658
[door opens]

28:23.702 --> 28:25.399
Hey, Gordie. What's up, man?
What brings you by?Hey.

28:25.442 --> 28:26.966
I was just in
the neighborhood.

28:27.009 --> 28:29.272
Figured I'd stop by,
maybe grab a bite.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.145
Maybe see how
it's going

28:32.188 --> 28:33.929
with that, uh, prisoner
you guys busted out.

28:35.452 --> 28:36.715
I think his name's
Elliott Hamler?

28:38.281 --> 28:41.284
Uh, Gordie,
I know this looks bad,

28:41.328 --> 28:44.723
but there's a reason
why we didn't w...I know.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.594
You were trying to protect me.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.596
And it's not like
I didn't suspect you guys

28:48.639 --> 28:49.989
would try something like this.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.686
But Higgins is my friend, too.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.166
Tell me what
I need to know,

28:53.209 --> 28:54.558
let's go get her back.

28:58.214 --> 28:59.389
Uh...

28:59.433 --> 29:00.782
Hamler's an old client.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.523
He blames me
for getting him locked up,

29:02.566 --> 29:05.700
so he sent his son
Miles to kidnap Higgins

29:05.744 --> 29:08.007
to use her as leverage
against me.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.617
TC:
Yeah, the only way the
son will let her go

29:09.660 --> 29:11.010
is if we give
him his father.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.446
We're still waiting
on the phone call

29:12.489 --> 29:13.882
with instructions for the trade.

29:15.144 --> 29:17.799
HPD has resources
to handle this kind of thing.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.453
We should be up on your phone
for starters.

29:19.496 --> 29:20.628
RICK:
No, no. Miles was
very specific.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.456
No cops.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.240
[phone ringing]

29:26.590 --> 29:27.766
This has got to be him.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.030
Yeah.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.335
MILES:
Do you have my father?I do.

29:32.379 --> 29:35.208
Nanakuli Forest Reserve.
30 minutes.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.731
Understood.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.864
And, Mr. Magnum, if I see anyone

29:38.907 --> 29:42.519
other than you
and my father there, she dies.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.244
It just kills you, doesn't it?

30:11.287 --> 30:12.680
Not being in control?

30:23.952 --> 30:25.519
Where is she?

30:41.970 --> 30:43.450
I'm okay.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.278
Here's how this is gonna go.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.280
I'm gonna count to three,
and then we send them across.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.891
Once they've switched,

30:49.935 --> 30:51.023
we go our separate ways.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.502
Works for me.

30:52.546 --> 30:53.634
Good.

30:53.677 --> 30:54.722
One.

30:55.549 --> 30:57.812
Two.[grunts]

30:57.856 --> 31:00.032
Three.
Wait, wait.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.295
Dad, what are you doing?

31:02.338 --> 31:05.820
We promised
we'd let your friend go.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.126
But...

31:07.169 --> 31:08.954
never said a word about you.

31:08.997 --> 31:09.955
What are you talking about?

31:09.998 --> 31:12.566
Change of plans.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.046
I'm gonna do the counting
this time.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.831
By the time I get to
zero, if Magnum here

31:16.875 --> 31:19.921
hasn't dropped his gun,
Kill her.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.055
Don't do this.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.839
HIGGINS:
Magnum.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.101
You can't trust them.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.408
Five...

31:29.757 --> 31:31.019
Four...

31:32.064 --> 31:32.978
Three...

31:34.196 --> 31:35.241
Two...

31:35.981 --> 31:36.895
[mouths]

31:37.373 --> 31:38.635
One...

31:54.825 --> 31:56.131
Well, let's go.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.744
It's gonna be okay.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.973
[engine starts]

32:32.080 --> 32:33.864
You okay? You hurt?

32:33.908 --> 32:35.562
No, I'm fine, but they took
Magnum. We have to get him back.

32:35.605 --> 32:36.998
We know.
We heard the whole thing.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.565
We planted a listening device
on Hamler.

32:38.608 --> 32:39.566
It also has a GPS.

32:39.609 --> 32:40.915
Yo! We got to move!

32:40.959 --> 32:42.656
Let's go, let's go.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.324
Let's go.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.066
MILES:
Hold on.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.154
We need to make sure

33:02.197 --> 33:03.764
Mr. Magnum followed the rules.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.855
[soft clicking]

33:11.990 --> 33:14.340
[beeping]

33:22.826 --> 33:23.871
Tracker.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.918
I should kill you right now.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.096
But I think I'll take my time.

33:31.139 --> 33:32.358
Get in.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.668
[engine starts]

33:46.111 --> 33:47.677
<i>[engine revving]</i>

33:53.422 --> 33:55.294
They must've switched cars.

33:55.337 --> 33:59.037
The GPS tracker
is still pinging to here.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.866
KATSUMOTO:
We know they took Magnum
with them.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.390
That means he's still alive.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.652
Yeah, but we have no idea
where they're headed.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.175
Okay.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.308
Miles must have an exfil plan
to get off the island.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.136
Right?
If he's smart,

34:11.179 --> 34:13.486
he set an exchange near the
airport they're planning to use.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.009
RICK: Makes sense.
Minimizes the risk

34:15.053 --> 34:16.402
of getting caught.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.012
Yeah, except there's
no airstrip near here.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.013
Commercial
or private.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.145
There's a port, though.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.189
It's a couple
miles from here.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.194
"Second Glance."What's that?

34:26.238 --> 34:27.891
Where I was being held,
I saw a note.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.676
It said "Second Glance.
Three and a half hours."

34:29.719 --> 34:31.373
<i>Second Glance</i>must be
the ship they're leaving on.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.940
Which makes three and
a half hours the travel time.

34:33.767 --> 34:34.898
They're taking a boat
to another island.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.074
[exhales]

34:42.819 --> 34:44.778
Smart play.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.172
Figure the cops are gonna be
at the airport,

34:47.215 --> 34:49.522
so you take a boat
to a neighboring island,

34:49.565 --> 34:51.132
jump on a plane from there--

34:51.176 --> 34:53.482
assuming to
a non-extradition country.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.615
Laos. You really do see
every angle.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.356
As much as I'd love to join,

34:57.399 --> 34:59.532
I didn't bring
my passport.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.056
You're just along
for insurance.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.710
Soon as I'm sure
we're not being followed...

35:03.753 --> 35:06.582
Kill me, dump my body
in the ocean, huh?

35:06.626 --> 35:08.323
Like I said,
every angle.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.459
Sit down.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.809
[exhales]

35:15.852 --> 35:17.115
Let's go.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.907
Guess he never told you
about your mother.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.910
Hey, you...

35:29.953 --> 35:31.172
shut your mouth.

35:32.565 --> 35:33.696
What about my mother?

35:34.871 --> 35:36.351
She was gonna divorce him.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.267
So he made her disappear.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.573
He's lying.

35:40.616 --> 35:41.922
She left us.
You know that. Let's go.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.010
Do you know that, Miles?

35:44.316 --> 35:46.318
Or is that a story
your dad likes to tell you?

35:46.361 --> 35:48.233
What is he talking about?

35:48.276 --> 35:49.712
Nothing, Miles!

35:49.756 --> 35:52.019
He's trying to get in your head.

35:52.062 --> 35:54.152
MAGNUM:
Come on. Think about it.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.242
Would your mother just
run off, disappear,

35:57.285 --> 35:58.504
never see you again?

35:58.547 --> 36:00.593
Or do you think
your father--

36:00.636 --> 36:02.682
a violent man with ties
to organized crime--

36:02.725 --> 36:04.684
had something to do
with her disappearance?

36:04.727 --> 36:06.207
[grunts]

36:06.251 --> 36:08.383
I said shut your mouth.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.212
Is it true?

36:13.258 --> 36:14.694
Tell him.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.437
I asked you, is it true?
