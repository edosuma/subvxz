00:17.309 --> 00:19.143
Mike! Mike! Mike!

00:19.245 --> 00:21.577
Mike, will the president be making
a statement about the House vote?

00:21.679 --> 00:24.481
No, the president will not be
making a statement at this time.

00:24.582 --> 00:26.550
While she was disappointed
in the result,

00:26.652 --> 00:28.684
she was thrilled to watch
democracy in action.

00:28.788 --> 00:31.754
I mean, the chances of this
happening in Russia,<i> nyet.</i>

00:31.856 --> 00:34.825
Mike, if Tom James wins
against Senator Montez

00:34.926 --> 00:37.728
in the Senate and becomes president,
will President Meyer consider...

00:37.829 --> 00:39.463
Okay, let me cut you off right there.

00:39.564 --> 00:42.698
Selina Meyer is not interested in
becoming vice president again.

00:42.801 --> 00:44.534
<i>That job is in her rearview mirror.</i>

00:44.637 --> 00:46.402
I stake my reputation on this.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.972
Selina Meyer will never be vice
president ever, ever again.

00:50.075 --> 00:53.143
<i>So, Tom, let's be real.</i>

00:53.244 --> 00:55.112
You're gonna be an accidental president.

00:55.213 --> 00:57.581
Pot, kettle.

00:57.682 --> 01:01.018
I'm here to offer my help

01:01.119 --> 01:04.153
in making this transition of power

01:04.256 --> 01:05.621
as smooth as possible

01:05.724 --> 01:09.793
by joining your administration.

01:09.894 --> 01:12.896
Well, strangely enough, I was
thinking along the same lines.

01:12.998 --> 01:15.031
Okay, fantastic. I'll
tell you what I want.

01:15.134 --> 01:16.834
I want secretary of state

01:16.936 --> 01:18.734
'cause I think that's
the least you can do.

01:18.837 --> 01:21.638
I was thinking vice president.

01:21.739 --> 01:24.608
That's literally the least you can do.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.676
And I really want secretary of state.

01:26.778 --> 01:30.046
- Vice president.
- Come on, secretary of state.

01:30.149 --> 01:32.915
<i>Vice President Meyer's got a
nice familiar ring to it.</i>

01:33.018 --> 01:34.151
No, it doesn't.

01:34.253 --> 01:36.186
Vice president, take it or leave it.

01:36.287 --> 01:39.890
I wouldn't be your veep if
there were a grassy knoll

01:39.991 --> 01:43.359
full of Jodie Foster
fans in the front row

01:43.462 --> 01:44.795
at your inauguration.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.430
That's a leave it.

01:46.531 --> 01:48.664
<i>General George
Washington could climb</i>

01:48.766 --> 01:52.536
out of his grave right now
and I would rather eat out

01:52.638 --> 01:56.139
his zombified wooden asshole twice a day

01:56.241 --> 01:58.808
than be his vice fucking...
fucking anything!

01:58.911 --> 02:01.311
Okay, let's put a pin in the VP for now.

02:02.947 --> 02:04.882
- Seriously?
- Morning, ma'am.

02:04.983 --> 02:07.516
Will somebody wake up Mike? Or not.
What's the difference?

02:07.620 --> 02:11.487
Ma'am, last night I ran a flash
poll on presidential scholars.

02:11.590 --> 02:15.359
They have rated you the 43rd
most effective president ever.

02:15.461 --> 02:17.026
- Out of how many?
<i>- 44.</i>

02:17.128 --> 02:18.829
You were right ahead of James Buchanan,

02:18.931 --> 02:20.497
who many feel caused the Civil War.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.000
Kent, can you give a girl
some warning next time

02:23.102 --> 02:24.501
before you jam it in the back door?

02:24.603 --> 02:26.402
Data gives no warning, ma'am.

02:26.504 --> 02:28.572
Any chance Marjorie and
Catherine want to get married?

02:28.674 --> 02:30.240
There you go, first White
House lesbian wedding.

02:30.341 --> 02:31.974
<i>That'll get you in the history books.</i>

02:32.076 --> 02:34.777
Oh, God. I can't take that
much acoustic guitar.

02:34.879 --> 02:37.381
What we have to do

02:37.483 --> 02:39.615
is we have to make Tibet happen.

02:39.718 --> 02:41.218
That's what's gonna be my legacy.

02:41.319 --> 02:43.520
Selina Meyer, the woman who freed Tibet.

02:43.622 --> 02:46.456
Ma'am, we've been in radio silence with
the Chinese for the last two weeks.

02:46.557 --> 02:51.194
Well, then why don't we send warships
out into the South China Seas?

02:51.296 --> 02:54.598
- Sea.
- I want my Nobel Peace Prize!

02:57.168 --> 02:58.634
Legacy!

03:00.171 --> 03:02.872
Legacy meeting adjourned.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.842
God, my phone is blowing
up with these TV offers.

03:05.944 --> 03:07.677
Think I'm gonna need an agent, you know,

03:07.780 --> 03:09.346
someone who can take the Dan
Egan brand to the next level.

03:09.448 --> 03:10.948
Too bad Goebbels killed himself.

03:11.050 --> 03:12.782
The only president

03:12.884 --> 03:15.085
to pee sitting down since FDR.

03:15.187 --> 03:17.287
Is that gonna be my legacy, Ben? Is it?

03:17.389 --> 03:20.122
Well, I pee sitting down sometimes
if it's gonna be a longy.

03:20.224 --> 03:21.925
Okay, we've got to make Tibet happen.

03:22.026 --> 03:24.294
Go through the Qataris, okay?

03:24.396 --> 03:27.497
I bet there are a dozen of them right
now at the Georgetown Four Seasons.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.365
Go to a Lamborghini
dealership, you know?

03:29.467 --> 03:32.468
Wherever they have prostitutes.
These guys could help you.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.439
I'm finished with your brag wall.

03:36.542 --> 03:38.474
All the photos of you with
the Washington elite.

03:38.576 --> 03:40.644
Are there any pictures where the
president isn't yelling at me?

03:40.746 --> 03:43.879
As far as I can tell, no such picture
exists in the known universe.

03:43.983 --> 03:46.582
Oh, also, we got to get
some eye candy in here.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.251
You know, hire some hot interns.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.486
Oh, Uncle Jeff sent a bunch of
resumes from New Hampshire.

03:50.588 --> 03:52.588
One of them was a phone
number on a bar napkin.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.224
No, New Hampshire is just a fancy
word for "it's cold outside,

03:55.326 --> 03:57.360
- so I don't shave my pubes."
- I'm writing that down.

03:57.462 --> 03:59.444
Focus on the warm-
weather states, okay?

03:59.471 --> 04:00.388
Congressman...

04:00.466 --> 04:02.231
I have a feeling you're gonna
do some really great things.

04:02.334 --> 04:03.967
I'm getting kind of hungry.
Do you think you could find

04:04.068 --> 04:06.103
a lobbyist to take me out
to lunch short notice?

04:06.205 --> 04:08.739
Try for Big Pharma. I
hear they do The Palm.

04:08.841 --> 04:11.207
Madam President, I'm afraid to tell you

04:11.310 --> 04:14.144
that the Chinese are rather
nervous about moving forward

04:14.246 --> 04:16.646
with Tibet now that you're out of power.

04:16.749 --> 04:20.983
I am not out of power and... at all.

04:21.086 --> 04:24.588
This has not, in fact, been
formally announced yet,

04:24.689 --> 04:27.990
- but I will be continuing on...
- Oh.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.326
...as, um...

04:31.863 --> 04:33.697
as vice president.

04:35.367 --> 04:37.600
Tom James offered it yesterday.

04:37.702 --> 04:39.836
It's really more of a
copresident position.

04:39.937 --> 04:41.670
- Wouldn't you agree with that, Ben?
- Sure.

04:41.774 --> 04:43.473
And between you and me,

04:43.574 --> 04:46.209
Tom James could be
healthier, I have to say.

04:46.310 --> 04:49.779
- Oh?
- Yeah, he's a bit of a, you know...

04:49.882 --> 04:52.983
Well, I suspect this will be of
great interest to the Chinese.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.685
Great. Thank you very much.
Yes, thank you.

04:55.788 --> 04:57.220
Oh, right, no touchy the ladies.

04:57.322 --> 04:59.189
Oh, no, no. It's fine. It's private.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.358
Just don't let the
lunatics back home know.

05:03.161 --> 05:04.927
<i>All right, come
on, Ben, let's go.</i>

05:05.029 --> 05:07.264
- Yes, ma'am.
- This is gonna suck.

05:07.365 --> 05:09.231
Hang on, I need to make a stop.

05:09.334 --> 05:11.567
- Madam President.
- Is the vice president in?

05:11.670 --> 05:13.336
No, he's at the Senate for the vote.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.172
Uh-huh.

05:28.086 --> 05:30.019
Okay, I can do this.

05:31.557 --> 05:33.889
- Selina Meyer. What a delight.
- Tom.

05:33.992 --> 05:36.593
Um, I've got good news.

05:36.694 --> 05:39.295
- I have decided to...
- No, don't tell me.

05:39.398 --> 05:42.064
You have decided to throw away

05:42.167 --> 05:44.367
every last shred of dignity you have

05:44.470 --> 05:46.435
and accept my offer of
the vice presidency.

05:46.538 --> 05:49.805
I... I guess so, yeah.

05:49.908 --> 05:51.240
I'm delighted to hear it.

05:51.343 --> 05:53.877
- Thank you.
- I don't want you to worry.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.947
You are not just gonna
be any vice president.

05:58.182 --> 06:00.350
You're gonna be a partner...

06:00.451 --> 06:03.386
and a very important
part of my administration.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.322
- You're a motherfucker.
- No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

06:06.425 --> 06:09.326
You're gonna be... you know,
you're gonna be part of the team.

06:09.427 --> 06:11.127
- You're gonna be at every meeting.
- Okay.

06:11.230 --> 06:12.596
It's like a shitty Groundhog Day.

06:12.697 --> 06:14.730
<i>Your country thanks you.</i>

06:14.833 --> 06:17.100
<i>Congressman Ryan's office.</i>

06:17.201 --> 06:18.367
- Congressman Ryan's office.
- Hello.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.870
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

06:19.971 --> 06:22.238
- Morning, sir.
- Congressman Ryan's office.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.906
Richard, who are these dudes?

06:24.009 --> 06:25.975
- Oh, these are the new interns.
- What?

06:26.077 --> 06:27.810
That's Colt. He's from UVA.
Played lacrosse.

06:27.913 --> 06:30.779
Richard, I told you to get hot interns.

06:30.882 --> 06:32.348
Sir, by any objective standards,

06:32.451 --> 06:34.417
Colt, Brady, and Mason are
unequivocally hot, not not.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.288
Hot interns means girls. How
the fuck do you not know that?

06:38.389 --> 06:40.990
Excuse me, sir. I made you a latte.

06:41.093 --> 06:43.259
Uh, thank you.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.495
Mmm, oh, my God, this
coffee is exceptional.

06:46.598 --> 06:48.398
Thanks.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.168
- Can we please keep him?
- Yeah, absolutely.

06:51.269 --> 06:53.103
Hey, Colt, welcome to team Ryan.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.704
I want you guys to get
used to two things...

06:54.805 --> 06:56.439
killing it daily on the Hill

06:56.542 --> 06:58.774
and nights rated PG-squirteen.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.343
- Baller.
- Baller.

07:00.444 --> 07:02.778
- Baller.
- Baller.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.115
<i>We are moments
away from the Senate vote</i>

07:05.216 --> 07:08.250
<i>for vice president between Senator
Tom James and Senator Laura Montez.</i>

07:08.353 --> 07:10.653
And, of course, with
the presidency vacant,

07:10.755 --> 07:13.822
<i>the winner of this vote
will assume the presidency.</i>

07:13.925 --> 07:16.425
Well, President Lu, I'm very glad

07:16.528 --> 07:18.093
that we've come to an agreement

07:18.197 --> 07:20.096
and I'm exceptionally glad

07:20.199 --> 07:22.932
that we're gonna have another
four years of working together.

07:23.035 --> 07:27.670
President Lu is particularly happy
to work alongside Senator James.

07:27.773 --> 07:30.372
He hears he's quite the statesman.

07:30.475 --> 07:33.843
Statesman-ish, which
is a joke, of course.

07:33.946 --> 07:35.612
- Ma'am?
<i>-  What?</i>

07:35.713 --> 07:38.215
We've got to see what's going
on in the Senate right away.

07:38.317 --> 07:39.316
You're kidding.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.084
Forgive me, President Lu,

07:41.185 --> 07:43.220
but I'm afraid I have
to go and attend to

07:43.322 --> 07:46.055
the vote that is happening
right now in our Senate.

07:46.158 --> 07:48.959
But feel free to follow
along on the television

07:49.060 --> 07:52.228
or perhaps on one of the many bugs

07:52.331 --> 07:54.363
that you've planted
throughout the White House.

07:54.466 --> 07:56.966
- Mr. Lowell.
- Senator James.

07:57.069 --> 07:58.802
Jesus Christ. What have we got?

07:58.903 --> 08:01.071
It's tighter than we thought, ma'am.
Tom up by two.

08:01.173 --> 08:02.738
- What?
- Mr. Murray.

08:02.841 --> 08:05.108
- Senator Montez.
- Up by one.

08:05.209 --> 08:07.276
- Tom, what's going on in here?
- I don't know, I...

08:07.379 --> 08:09.079
Senator Montez.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.348
- You motherfucker!
<i>- Nelson voted against you?</i>

08:11.449 --> 08:13.449
But Nelson is your protÃ©gÃ©, man.

08:13.552 --> 08:14.951
Get Nelson on the phone right...

08:15.052 --> 08:17.019
- this doesn't just happen.
- Tom, he voted!

08:17.122 --> 08:19.990
They're going alphabetically.
Get somebody after him.

08:20.091 --> 08:21.725
- Get Wallace on the phone.
- Get Wallace!

08:21.826 --> 08:23.927
I'm hearing something about
your "borking" Dunkirk.

08:24.028 --> 08:26.596
<i>- What?</i>
- Yeah, on a circuit court nominee.

08:26.697 --> 08:28.932
That was... no. That was 10 years ago.

08:29.033 --> 08:31.000
Someone is trying to fuck me.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.601
Tom James.

08:32.703 --> 08:36.337
Thank you, Summerlin, you
senile old piss sponge.

08:36.441 --> 08:38.375
- 50-48.
<i>- Tom needs just one more.</i>

08:38.476 --> 08:40.710
<i>Got all kinds of
rumors about vote trading.</i>

08:40.812 --> 08:44.614
- It's not us.
- Oh, fuck. Wallace is going Montez.

08:44.716 --> 08:48.018
She's telling people that you reneged
on her Alaskan coast cleanup bill.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.120
That was a handout to Big Oil.

08:50.221 --> 08:53.123
- Mrs. Wallace.
- Senator Montez.

08:53.225 --> 08:56.259
50-49. This is not Montez.
She's getting help.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.378
Mr. Yinui.

08:57.403 --> 09:00.453
Come on, you page-diddling
Hawaiian fat fuck.

09:00.532 --> 09:02.798
Senator Montez.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.634
- That's 50.
- Not another tie.

09:05.736 --> 09:07.971
<i>- What now?</i>
- A tie in the Senate

09:08.072 --> 09:10.072
is broken by the
president of the Senate.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.775
Or what we humans call
the vice president.

09:12.878 --> 09:15.110
Oh, my God, perfect. You can vote
for yourself. Go, go, go, go.

09:15.212 --> 09:19.014
<i>- Tom's not veep, you butler.</i>
- Doyle is vice president.

09:19.116 --> 09:21.116
Being called upon to cast this vote

09:21.219 --> 09:23.919
is a pleasure and an honor,

09:24.022 --> 09:25.388
not a burden.

09:25.490 --> 09:28.091
There's been enough
uncertainty in this country,

09:28.192 --> 09:30.860
so I won't stall any further.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.697
- Please.
- Come on, just spit it out.

09:33.798 --> 09:38.668
With this in mind, I vote
for Senator Laura Montez.

09:38.769 --> 09:41.203
<i> It's official.</i>

09:41.306 --> 09:44.006
<i>The United States of America
has a new president.</i>

09:44.109 --> 09:46.676
<i>This is a truly stunning turn of events</i>

09:46.778 --> 09:48.010
<i>for Laura Montez.</i>

09:48.113 --> 09:50.447
Now you know what it feels like.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.817
I've got a source. Apparently Doyle
masterminded the whole thing.

09:54.919 --> 09:57.251
Rumor has it he's getting
secretary of state.

09:57.277 --> 09:58.745
Secretary of state.

10:00.158 --> 10:02.424
God, I hate this country.

10:02.527 --> 10:04.561
I know.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.236
You fuckers.

10:14.339 --> 10:15.739
How dare you?

10:15.841 --> 10:18.240
That magnificent woman

10:18.342 --> 10:20.744
counted on you and you
losers let her down.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.812
Yeah, I got to call you back.
Something amazing is happening.

10:22.913 --> 10:26.615
All you fucking cared about
was your stupid, bad selves.

10:26.717 --> 10:30.186
Your numbers...
your numbers are garbage.

10:30.288 --> 10:32.922
Your speeches, garbage.

10:33.024 --> 10:35.091
And you're
supposed to give her advice?

10:35.192 --> 10:37.126
Is that right? All I heard was dumb,

10:37.229 --> 10:38.827
stupid I don't know
what the fuck it was.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.996
Garbage?

10:41.099 --> 10:43.700
- Gary...
- Oh, shut up!

10:46.238 --> 10:49.105
You screwed her the worst.

10:49.206 --> 10:51.140
In all the ways.

10:51.243 --> 10:53.643
Oh, I know...

10:53.745 --> 10:55.110
I know you make fun of me

10:55.212 --> 10:57.447
and I know that you think that I'm funny

10:57.548 --> 11:00.182
and I'm funny, ha, ha, ha.
Well, at least I cared.

11:00.284 --> 11:03.852
I did my job! I fucking cared!

11:08.692 --> 11:11.126
Well, that just kind of made
this whole year worth it.

11:11.229 --> 11:12.128
Yeah.

11:13.764 --> 11:17.232
<i>Today is a great
day for democracy.</i>

11:17.335 --> 11:21.571
It marks the beginning of a
new chapter for America.

11:21.673 --> 11:25.975
<i>You know, the vote we just witnessed
sends one very clear message.</i>

11:26.076 --> 11:29.412
Now is the time we put
our divisions aside

11:29.514 --> 11:31.815
and we move this great nation forward.

11:31.917 --> 11:36.119
<i>I just spoke to my good
friend Senator Bill O'Brien</i>

11:36.221 --> 11:38.254
<i>and I'm happy to say</i>

11:38.355 --> 11:42.057
<i>he's fully endorsing my presidency,</i>

11:42.159 --> 11:44.661
<i>so I will be counting on his help...</i>

11:44.763 --> 11:46.296
I need fruit.

11:46.398 --> 11:51.234
<i>...as I guide America out
of these turbulent times.</i>

11:52.604 --> 11:54.037
Here she is, baby Ellen.

11:54.139 --> 11:56.639
Yeah, she seems really,
really large for a baby.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.475
I was a tall kid when I was three.

11:58.576 --> 12:00.777
In fact, people in the neighborhood
thought something was wrong with me

12:00.879 --> 12:02.412
'cause I was the size
of a five-year-old.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.812
So what's the reason now, then?

12:03.914 --> 12:06.149
Morning, Madam President. I am back.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.884
- Were you gone?
- Nevada. Six days.

12:08.986 --> 12:09.645
Oh, wow.

12:09.671 --> 12:11.644
Yeah, it was a really,
really amazing visit.

12:11.722 --> 12:15.692
This is Mee-Maw's painting back here and
I want to make sure to get this home.

12:15.793 --> 12:18.595
Okay, that's technically
Catherine's painting.

12:24.336 --> 12:25.567
- Hey.
- Hello.

12:25.669 --> 12:28.738
Are you here selling a young
adult fiction idea, too?

12:28.840 --> 12:31.139
Mine takes place in
an alternate timeline

12:31.243 --> 12:34.076
where overweight, alcoholic
ex-chiefs of staff

12:34.178 --> 12:35.445
are considered a sexual prize.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.312
Alternate timelines are a crutch

12:37.414 --> 12:40.350
for lazy sci-fi premises,
e.g., "Star Trek"

12:40.451 --> 12:42.784
with the exception of "Deep Space Nine."

12:42.888 --> 12:44.754
You should try your
hand at romance novels.

12:44.855 --> 12:46.655
- I have.
- Mmm.

12:46.758 --> 12:49.658
You hear Montez is looking to keep
one senior White House staffer?

12:49.760 --> 12:52.161
Probably just a rumor.
Wouldn't worry about it.

12:52.264 --> 12:55.999
As is customary, President-Elect Montez

12:56.100 --> 12:59.469
and her family will spend
tonight at Blair House.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.705
Tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M.,
she will join President Meyer

13:02.807 --> 13:04.573
for coffee in the Red Room

13:04.676 --> 13:06.708
before heading to the inauguration.

13:06.811 --> 13:10.279
<i>MSNBC has just learned
that President-Elect Montez</i>

13:10.381 --> 13:12.032
- <i> plans to nominate Wall
Street banker Charlie Baird...</i>

13:12.683 --> 13:15.118
- That seems about right.
- <i> ...to be her secretary of the treasury.</i>

13:15.220 --> 13:19.221
<i>President Meyer dated the
banker briefly late last year.</i>

13:27.731 --> 13:29.465
Oh, hey, Richard.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.533
Oh, Madam President.

13:31.635 --> 13:35.138
Uh, I'm just finishing packing up
Congressman Ryan's old office.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.639
I have to do it now because
it's the last night before...

13:37.741 --> 13:41.110
Yeah, I know what it's the
last night before of.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.145
You know about Colt's birthday dinner?

13:43.248 --> 13:46.381
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's very, very, very relaxing.

13:46.484 --> 13:48.116
I should have relied
on you more, Richard.

13:48.219 --> 13:50.320
I mean, really, seriously,
you're one of the good ones.

13:50.422 --> 13:52.087
Oh, well, thank you, Madam President.

13:52.190 --> 13:55.424
I mean, if I had had 100 Richards,
who knows what I could have done?

13:55.527 --> 13:57.427
Probably a lot.

13:57.528 --> 13:59.995
Or it could turn out like one of
those "Twilight Zone" scenarios

14:00.097 --> 14:01.764
where we all murder each other.

14:01.865 --> 14:05.434
I don't even remember how to drive.

14:06.837 --> 14:09.238
- I need a wallet.
- Probably.

14:09.341 --> 14:11.941
- And stamps. I've got to get stamps.
- Yeah.

14:12.043 --> 14:15.244
If I was a little girl and you said
to me, "What do you want to do?"

14:15.346 --> 14:17.813
I would have said, "Please,
can I be president?"

14:17.916 --> 14:22.451
And then it turned out to be the
12 loneliest months of my life.

14:22.553 --> 14:24.553
My auntie used to talk about
loneliness like that.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.023
- Okay, so, right, you know that.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:27.125 --> 14:29.591
We were pretty, pretty close,

14:29.693 --> 14:32.195
especially 'cause my
mother was so much older.

14:32.297 --> 14:34.364
Old enough to be my grandmother,
as a matter of fact.

14:34.466 --> 14:35.865
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:35.966 --> 14:39.067
Maybe my auntie was
actually my real mother

14:39.169 --> 14:42.337
and my mother was
actually my grandmother.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.073
Ah, wow, that's starting to
make a whole lot of sense.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.243
Everybody knew about it but me, too.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.778
Are we praying, ma'am?

14:48.879 --> 14:50.812
No, I'm just gonna lie down.

14:52.917 --> 14:55.018
Oh, God.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.520
Oh, I wish I had won.

14:58.623 --> 15:00.188
I wish everybody won.

15:03.260 --> 15:04.693
Ma'am?

15:05.864 --> 15:08.063
Ma'am?

15:08.166 --> 15:11.267
Ma'am? Okay.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.705
Can you just stay?

15:15.807 --> 15:17.940
Mm-hmm. Absolutely, ma'am.

15:25.783 --> 15:28.350
<i> Special smoothie</i>

15:28.452 --> 15:30.153
for a special lady.

15:31.322 --> 15:34.389
- What happened?
- I don't know.

15:34.491 --> 15:37.894
Oh, my God, I hope I
didn't fuck Richard.

15:37.995 --> 15:39.461
What?

15:39.563 --> 15:43.399
- Okay, you need some help?
- No. Ow. Ow.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.634
Okay, Mrs. Montez and her
family, they're on their way.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.769
You're gonna greet them at
the North Portico doorway.

15:47.871 --> 15:49.572
- Mom.
- Oh!

15:49.673 --> 15:50.448
Wow!

15:50.474 --> 15:52.798
Have you seen my film?
The hard drive is missing.

15:52.876 --> 15:54.777
Honey, look at you.

15:54.879 --> 15:56.946
Yeah, I've been working
with this new stylist

15:57.048 --> 15:59.315
since I've been doing all this
press for the rescue farm.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.018
- It's my new look.
- Oh.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.821
Mom, you're gonna do something
with your hair, right?

16:04.923 --> 16:06.522
Huh?

16:06.624 --> 16:09.625
Oh, God. Look at this.

16:09.727 --> 16:11.693
Okay, you listen to me. Listen to me.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.962
They can take away your presidency,

16:14.065 --> 16:16.999
they can take away your power,
they can take away your dignity,

16:17.101 --> 16:20.937
but what is the one thing that
they cannot take away from you?

16:21.038 --> 16:23.272
- My beauty.
- That's right. Let's go.

16:23.374 --> 16:25.774
<i> Go back door! Back door!</i>

16:25.876 --> 16:27.976
- Put it up!
- Oh!

16:28.078 --> 16:29.644
- That's it.
- You fouled me.

16:29.748 --> 16:32.749
Do you realize the whole goddamn
Rayburn House Office Building

16:32.850 --> 16:36.485
can hear you and your twink army in here
cock scraping each other's esophagi?

16:36.587 --> 16:38.386
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
We were roughhousing.

16:38.490 --> 16:41.190
Jesus, Will, are you looking
at what I'm looking at here?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.558
Will, tell him the first
rule of hiring male staff.

16:43.661 --> 16:46.461
They must be substantially less
attractive than the congressman.

16:46.563 --> 16:48.630
And I almost hired an Iraqi war veteran.

16:48.732 --> 16:52.168
Third degree burns on half of his face,
but the guy had personality, so...

16:52.269 --> 16:54.003
Will, tell him why I hired you instead.

16:54.105 --> 16:56.371
Because I'm repulsive both
in appearance and manner.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.607
Now let me give you some advice

16:58.710 --> 17:01.376
before you're yanked out of here
like a cheerleader's unwanted fetus.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.613
You say nothing and you do less.

17:03.715 --> 17:05.748
And take off those fucking glasses.

17:05.848 --> 17:08.884
You look like Clark Kent if they dug up
Christopher Reeve's corpse to play the part.

17:08.987 --> 17:12.154
And as for you ladies,
this is DC, not Miami.

17:13.589 --> 17:16.057
- Congratulations, Jonah.
- Thanks, man.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.326
Fuck that guy.

17:18.429 --> 17:20.328
Come on, let's go. Game on. Here we go.

17:20.431 --> 17:21.896
- All right, ready?
- Alley-oop!

17:22.000 --> 17:24.432
My fucking nuts!

17:24.536 --> 17:26.536
Oh, shit, Colt.

17:26.637 --> 17:28.904
Call a doctor and call my mom.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.041
Hey, have you ever used
that Truman bowling alley?

17:33.144 --> 17:35.344
No, no, of course not. I worked here.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.614
I didn't go to the White House for
a fourth grade birthday party.

17:38.715 --> 17:40.883
Jesus. Oh, I'm sorry.

17:40.984 --> 17:42.018
I'm sorry. That's...

17:42.119 --> 17:44.319
- Amy, hi.
- <i> Hey, Candi.</i>

17:44.422 --> 17:46.689
Congratulations. Wow.
Montez's new chief of staff.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.691
- Ben here is just showing me around.
- I am.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.692
You've interviewed here so many times,

17:50.795 --> 17:53.429
I'd think that you'd know the place
like the back of your hand by now.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.865
- Kent Davison.
- Mike McLintock.

17:55.967 --> 17:58.233
- Any luck with the new job search?
- Uh...

17:58.336 --> 18:01.237
Oh, it's all right. I'm back at
the "Post," so we're good. Yeah.

18:01.338 --> 18:02.605
This is Debralee, our surrogate.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.972
- Hi.
- The twins are in there.

18:04.075 --> 18:05.607
- In there.
- In here.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.844
And this is Ellen,

18:07.945 --> 18:09.711
our new big girl. She's three.

18:09.814 --> 18:12.347
Mike, she has the head
circumference of a six-year-old.

18:12.450 --> 18:14.450
I'm six.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.184
What did she say?

18:16.287 --> 18:18.554
Here's an interesting fact.

18:18.655 --> 18:21.022
Would you believe that it
was called the Red Room

18:21.125 --> 18:22.724
before it was actually painted red?

18:22.826 --> 18:24.993
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- I heard that.</i>

18:25.096 --> 18:25.913
Yeah.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.387
What'd it cost to paint
this thing back then?

18:28.465 --> 18:29.392
$12.

18:29.416 --> 18:32.192
<i>Yeah, $12. I was
thinking right around 15.</i>

18:32.269 --> 18:35.037
I think it was a slave state,
so it might have been free.

18:35.138 --> 18:37.606
<i> Oh.</i>

18:37.709 --> 18:40.809
Oh, I'm just wondering... boys.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.112
- Boys. They're fine.
- No. Okay.

18:43.213 --> 18:47.450
Hell, when my boys were that age,
they'd have just torn this place apart.

18:47.551 --> 18:50.318
I have three boys. My entire
house smells like an armpit.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.322
Ooh, hate to hear that.
See, glad I have girls.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.223
Girls will cost you later.

18:55.326 --> 18:58.126
Mm, girls are the worst.

19:00.964 --> 19:04.267
Well, I also heard that it might
go down into the teens tonight.

19:04.368 --> 19:06.903
Hey, I better get out my fur
for the ball tonight, right?

19:07.005 --> 19:08.904
<i> Yes, you should.</i>

19:09.007 --> 19:11.307
Well, give me the heat any day.

19:11.409 --> 19:13.576
But then again, I grew up in Mexico.

19:13.678 --> 19:15.076
<i>Well, sure, yeah, we know that.</i>

19:15.179 --> 19:16.679
His family is from Jalisco.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.847
<i>Es muy caliente</i> there.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.951
And where exactly in Ohio
are you from, Laura?

19:23.054 --> 19:26.288
Um, well, I grew up

19:26.391 --> 19:30.092
right outside of Cleveland,
but after, you know,

19:30.193 --> 19:34.529
15 years, I feel like I
am 100% New Mexican.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.232
New Mexican, but not Mexican?

19:40.771 --> 19:42.371
Of all the White House traditions,

19:42.472 --> 19:44.874
this one is probably my favorite.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.808
- Is it? Oh.
- Yeah.

19:58.221 --> 20:00.923
Damn it. I just had it.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.726
I have this thing every day
and now I can't find it.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.095
Okay.

20:06.196 --> 20:08.897
An estimated one million
people are anxiously awaiting

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
<i>the arrival of President-Elect
Laura Montez.</i>

20:12.103 --> 20:15.136
Montez! Montez! Montez!

20:17.174 --> 20:19.307
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

20:19.410 --> 20:23.346
<i>the President of the United
States, Selina Meyer.</i>

20:27.218 --> 20:29.484

has taken the stage.</i>

20:29.586 --> 20:32.253
And she's greeting a very
attractive stranger.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.057
<i>That is first
daughter Catherine Meyer.</i>

20:35.159 --> 20:37.359
Oh, wow. Too bad.

20:37.461 --> 20:39.228
<i>The handoff of power has begun.</i>

20:39.329 --> 20:41.497
<i>President-Elect Montez will be sworn in</i>

20:41.598 --> 20:44.900
<i>and address the nation as
president for the first time.</i>

20:45.002 --> 20:47.403
Why'd you do it, Andrew?

20:47.505 --> 20:49.505
I offered you secretary of state.

20:49.606 --> 20:51.173
You offered it to everybody in town.

20:51.275 --> 20:53.808
Your head is so far up Montez's ass.

20:53.911 --> 20:57.546
Next time it's Alejandro's birthday,
he's gonna come all over your face.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.981
Oh.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.916
That's the truth.

21:02.019 --> 21:05.421
President Meyer taking a moment to
catch up with her vice president

21:05.522 --> 21:07.722
<i>and longtime political
ally Andrew Doyle.</i>

21:07.825 --> 21:10.226
Those two have a very
special relationship.

21:10.327 --> 21:14.896
I, Laura Priscilla Montez,
do solemnly swear...

21:14.999 --> 21:19.101
I, Laura Priscilla Montez,
do solemnly swear...

21:19.202 --> 21:21.569
<i>...that I will faithfully
execute the office</i>

21:21.672 --> 21:23.739
<i>of President of the United States...</i>

21:23.840 --> 21:26.008
...that I will faithfully
execute the office

21:26.109 --> 21:27.910
of President of the United States...

21:28.011 --> 21:30.179
...and will to the best of my ability...

21:30.280 --> 21:32.314
...and will to the best of my ability...

21:32.416 --> 21:36.451
...preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States.

21:36.554 --> 21:40.522
...preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States.

21:40.625 --> 21:41.990
So help me God.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.992
So help me God.

21:44.095 --> 21:47.262
Congratulations, Madam President.

21:50.801 --> 21:52.300
Gracias.

21:52.403 --> 21:54.069
My fellow citizens,

21:54.172 --> 21:56.971
this is the dawn of a new era.

21:57.075 --> 21:59.842
<i>Una epoca nueva.</i>

22:01.846 --> 22:03.979
We are interrupting
President Montez's speech

22:04.082 --> 22:05.548
<i>to bring you breaking news.</i>

22:05.650 --> 22:07.282
<i>On the left side of your screen,</i>

22:07.384 --> 22:10.185
<i>you're seeing live footage
from Andrews Air Force Base.</i>

22:10.288 --> 22:13.556
We have just learned that mere
minutes into her presidency,

22:13.657 --> 22:15.523
President Montez has brokered a deal

22:15.625 --> 22:18.426
with the Chinese
government to free Tibet.

22:18.528 --> 22:21.529
<i>And on board that plane are
the so-called baby lamas,</i>

22:21.632 --> 22:23.598
<i>Tibetan spiritual leaders
who have been freed</i>

22:23.701 --> 22:25.534
<i>from decades of Chinese captivity</i>

22:25.635 --> 22:28.069
as part of this historic agreement.

22:28.172 --> 22:31.140
This will no doubt put President
Montez in line for the Nobel Prize.

22:31.241 --> 22:34.742
<i>...all of our problems.
We must put our faith...</i>

22:34.846 --> 22:38.413
You're not gonna believe this,
but she just freed the lamas.

22:38.516 --> 22:40.182
What?

22:40.284 --> 22:42.585
She brokered with the
Chinese to free Tibet.

22:42.686 --> 22:44.452
Thank you. May God bless you

22:44.555 --> 22:47.388
and may God bless America.

22:52.063 --> 22:54.163
Madam President.

22:54.265 --> 22:56.898
Oh, Senator James.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.602
An historic day for womankind.

22:59.703 --> 23:01.403
What'd you think of the speech?

23:01.506 --> 23:03.771
I had no idea her tits were that big.

23:05.242 --> 23:06.909
So what's next for you?

23:07.010 --> 23:09.411
Well, I've always dreamed
of living in a small town,

23:09.513 --> 23:12.548
having a little place on Main Street,
hanging a shingle out front,

23:12.650 --> 23:15.384
and running my own little
multibillion-dollar hedge fund.

23:15.486 --> 23:17.086
- <i> Uh-huh.</i>
- You know, back to basics.

23:17.188 --> 23:21.123
Okay. All right. Well,
I'll see you around.

23:21.224 --> 23:22.557
- See you around.
- See you around.

23:22.660 --> 23:25.493
- Madam President.
- What?

23:25.596 --> 23:27.429
Nice shoes.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.698
Oh, come on, man.

23:31.301 --> 23:34.336
Thank you.

23:34.438 --> 23:37.306
Thank you. Thank you.

23:37.407 --> 23:40.009
- Where's Sue?
- I don't know.

23:43.114 --> 23:45.381
Well, I'm not good with good-byes.

23:47.084 --> 23:49.117
Or winning presidential elections.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.685
Well, that's not true.

23:50.788 --> 23:53.888
- Yeah, it is.
- Okay.

23:53.990 --> 23:55.457
Um...

23:57.694 --> 23:59.494
I don't know what to say.

23:59.596 --> 24:01.462
Was I supposed to write
something, ma'am?

24:01.566 --> 24:02.865
Nobody told me.

24:02.967 --> 24:04.599
I thought he was getting a baby.

24:04.701 --> 24:06.468
Yeah, that's not a baby.

24:06.570 --> 24:10.806
Uh, well, we gave America
everything we had.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.273
Yeah, sure did.

24:12.375 --> 24:15.376
Inspiring words, ma'am. Godspeed.

24:15.479 --> 24:18.681
Thank you, all of you.

24:19.983 --> 24:22.684
It's...

24:22.787 --> 24:24.534
All right, let's go, girls.
Get on the thing.

24:24.558 --> 24:25.545
<i> Good-bye, ma'am.</i>

24:25.623 --> 24:27.756
<i>- Ma'am.</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

24:39.869 --> 24:41.237
Ma'am!

24:41.338 --> 24:43.638
Ma'am, I just want to thank you

24:43.740 --> 24:45.307
- for everything you did...
- Amy, just come with us.

24:45.409 --> 24:47.108
- No.
- No, no, you should just come.

24:47.211 --> 24:49.278
Okay, but I don't even have my...

24:55.086 --> 24:57.219
Where are they going?

25:06.696 --> 25:09.964
Gosh, from a distance, it
looks really beautiful.

25:11.535 --> 25:13.635
Yeah, from a distance.

25:15.506 --> 25:17.740
Can I borrow somebody's phone?
I have to check on Buddy.

25:17.842 --> 25:19.807
- Oh, did you get a dog?
- Buddy's my...

25:19.910 --> 25:21.376
Ooh, what was that?

25:21.479 --> 25:23.378
- Okay.
- What the fuck is that?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.681
<i>Small problem with one of
the engines, Madam President.</i>

25:25.782 --> 25:28.250
- <i> We're gonna have to take her back down.</i>
- Oh, Lord.

25:30.020 --> 25:32.453
Hell of a time to run out of gas.

25:32.556 --> 25:34.990
If you could just step away
from the aircraft for a bit,

25:35.092 --> 25:36.392
we'll call you a motorcade.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.559
Oh, my God.

25:38.663 --> 25:41.297
- What am I walking on?
- Grass, ma'am.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.634
- Mom.
- What?

25:45.736 --> 25:48.403
Are you sure you don't know where
the hard drive of my film is?

25:48.506 --> 25:49.971
- No.
- No.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.710
What is that sound?

25:54.811 --> 25:56.944
The parade, ma'am.

25:57.048 --> 25:59.615
I think I can walk back from here.

26:33.451 --> 26:35.351
Oh, my God.

26:38.021 --> 26:39.855
Here you go.

26:47.664 --> 26:49.765
Maybe it'll ruin her parade.

26:49.866 --> 26:53.234
That's it from the National Mall.
Back to you, Wolf.

26:53.336 --> 26:55.403
<i>And clear.</i>

26:55.506 --> 26:57.138
- Nice work, Egan.
- Thank you.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.174
- I may have a full-time gig for you.
- Really?

27:00.277 --> 27:04.480
We've got an opening for someone to cover
the state department on the overnight.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.481
- Really?
- Easy, Cronkite.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.259
Just think of it as
morning somewhere. Carrie?

27:08.284 --> 27:08.840
Yes?

27:09.819 --> 27:12.444
Could you give me tomorrow's
research, please?

27:12.522 --> 27:14.155
So, what do you say?

27:14.258 --> 27:16.724
I just got an offer from CBS News.

27:17.862 --> 27:20.194
So, Greg, I will say this...

27:20.297 --> 27:21.730
Egan out.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.400
Yeah, I just got your email.

27:24.501 --> 27:26.934
I just want to make sure the
job is with CBS, right?

27:27.037 --> 27:28.703
That's Columbia Broadcasting?

27:28.806 --> 27:31.940
Yeah, there's just some
minor swelling, Mr. Ryan,

27:32.041 --> 27:33.541
but nothing a little ice won't fix.

27:33.644 --> 27:35.611
Excellent.

27:35.712 --> 27:38.780
Hoo. I have tickets to the
inaugural ball tonight.

27:38.883 --> 27:41.016
- Oh.
- Yeah. I'm a congressman.

27:41.117 --> 27:45.354
The second ticket is unclaimed
if you're available.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.289
I'm married. I have the ring
hiding under the gloves.

27:48.392 --> 27:50.025
- No, I saw it.
- No. Oh.

27:50.126 --> 27:51.859
Anyway, there is no
easy way to say this,

27:51.961 --> 27:54.797
but you have a lump on
your left testicle.

27:54.898 --> 27:57.900
I just want to biopsy it and
we can take it from there.

27:58.001 --> 27:59.401
Take what from where?

27:59.502 --> 28:01.670
Early detection would
have prevented this.

28:01.771 --> 28:03.704
We really encourage regular self-exams.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.972
Yeah, I know.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.377
Oh, they're waiting for you
in the Roosevelt Room, ma'am.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.512
- Thank you, Sue.
- <i> Of course.</i>

28:11.615 --> 28:14.715
Selina, good news. We found
the missing Nevada ballots.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.285
You won.
