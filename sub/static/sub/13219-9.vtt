Previously on <i> Aquarius...</i>

00:08.442 --> 00:09.908
Stop. Get in your car and go.

00:09.910 --> 00:12.978
He owes me, and I can use him
to get in with Butano,

00:12.980 --> 00:14.546
skip the pushers,
get to the supplier.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.615
(GUNSHOT)
(BODY HITTING FLOOR)

00:19.820 --> 00:21.320
But maybe now
you feel different

00:21.322 --> 00:23.122
and I hope
you're more disposed

00:23.124 --> 00:24.623
to seeing me
for what I am.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.724
That is so cute.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.760
Would you please go
get me a cup of coffee?

00:27.762 --> 00:29.061
Do you know
what emancipation is?

00:29.063 --> 00:30.662
-Yes.
-We'd just make it official.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.865
-Set you legally free.
-EMMA: <i> You and Charlie...</i>

00:32.867 --> 00:35.100
<i> I saw the way you</i>
<i> looked at each other.</i>

00:35.102 --> 00:35.634
Goodbye, Ken.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.302
Why are we working
so hard to find

00:37.304 --> 00:39.371
a hooker who's been
missing for seven years?

00:39.373 --> 00:40.372
Because a guy
named Ken Karn

00:40.374 --> 00:42.908
and his friends
don't want us to.

00:43.778 --> 00:46.512
(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)

00:58.259 --> 01:01.093
-Salazar again.
-Jeez. What now?

01:01.095 --> 01:03.395
Spics can't get justice
'cause there's no spics

01:03.397 --> 01:04.630
in the department.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.365
Not true.
Cleaning lady...

01:06.367 --> 01:08.434
Ladies.
Plural, please.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.170
We got Portillo, Sanchez,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.738
that new meter maid, Corazon.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.074
I think he means
no senior officers.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.775
It'd be good if
there were a few.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.645
Nice to have some brass
I don't have to listen to.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.413
You don't listen now.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.881
Sorry, what?

01:22.950 --> 01:23.882
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

01:23.884 --> 01:26.351
Spics should get promoted
'cause they're spics?

Give me a break, <i> por favor.</i>

(CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING)

01:45.039 --> 01:47.806
Oh, yeah, this is what
I call a real pickle.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.041
Ah.

01:49.176 --> 01:49.541
What?

01:49.543 --> 01:51.577
It's the orphanage Christmas
party and I'm late,

01:51.579 --> 01:54.012
and you still owe 10 bucks
for presents.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.013
You know...

01:55.015 --> 01:56.482
I was wondering where
the lieutenant is.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.084
Your fairy godfather's
at a racket in San Diego.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.620
Sorry.
Left me in charge, again.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.455
None of that's yours,
I hope.

02:04.191 --> 02:04.623
No, I'm fine.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.025
Look, there's no getting
around it. I'm a witness.

02:07.027 --> 02:10.596
Well, I'll go bust Lucille and
that biker and call it a day.

02:10.598 --> 02:11.930
I don't want Lucille.
I want <i> guapo.</i>

02:11.932 --> 02:14.333
-Then you didn't see anything.
-Oh, man. Here we go again.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.469
Yes, again, so why don't you
predict what I'm gonna say

02:17.471 --> 02:19.004
so I don't have to say it,
again.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.840
Something like, uh, Jimmy was
a low-life criminal,

02:21.842 --> 02:23.609
didn't pay his taxes,
had it coming.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.343
-Something like that?
-Yes.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.745
That's what actual policemen
call "misdemeanor homicide."

02:26.747 --> 02:30.149
Jimmy was your route to <i> guapo.</i>
Jimmy is now dead.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.049
Lucille is now your route.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.452
But she can't be your route
if you arrest her.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.786
CUTLER:
Plus no body.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.722
How much does the DA
love that?

02:36.724 --> 02:37.823
We all love that.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.491
CUTLER: Listen,
it's your call, junior.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.993
Sammy here can go make
two murder arrests

02:40.995 --> 02:42.694
that'll never stick,
and blow your cover.

02:42.696 --> 02:47.032
Or, we just call this one last
name on my naughty list.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.007
MIKE: <i> Man, I'm done.</i>

02:55.009 --> 02:56.441
-Look, I get it. Okay?
-No, you don't, man.

02:56.443 --> 03:00.445
Look at you, you have got
a job. You have got a life.

03:00.447 --> 03:01.313
You are in charge of you.

03:01.315 --> 03:05.984
First of all, I'm a cop,
so, no, and second of all,

03:05.986 --> 03:08.754
I'm married, so really, no.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.024
You're married?

03:12.193 --> 03:13.458
Yeah.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.961
-Did I know that?
-I hope not.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.797
Otherwise, I'd be
pretty bad at all this.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.900
You have kids?

03:22.836 --> 03:24.102
One.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.438
(LAUGHS)

03:27.141 --> 03:29.374
I want to have kids.

03:30.177 --> 03:30.776
Someday.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.478
Well, first, you got to
get to "someday."

03:33.480 --> 03:35.180
So you're gonna go back
in there, you're gonna stay

03:35.182 --> 03:38.850
close to Lucille,
and you're gonna...

03:38.852 --> 03:41.253
Give her anything she wants.

03:41.255 --> 03:44.022
You don't know
what you're asking.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.090
None.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.093
In the bedroom,
it's like being mauled.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.428
Oh, I am weeping for you.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.897
-You want me to show you what
she did to me last night?
-No, no.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.366
This is after she wasted
the guy, man,
because the blood,

03:54.368 --> 03:56.501
-it just riled her up, man.
-Stop. I believe you.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.604
-I believe you, okay?
-She's out of her mind, sick.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.506
-Look at this.
-Mike, okay?

04:01.742 --> 04:02.441
But she likes you.

04:02.443 --> 04:06.178
And she trusts you and right
now, you got her in heat.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.581
Mike, my job is to get
that woman to trust me.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.382
Which she only half does.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.351
Your job is to ball her
until she can't see straight.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.087
I really think you're the one
coming out on top.

Give me a moment.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.111
I was just there, Charlie.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.815
Where's that, Kenny-Ken?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.419
You know.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.890
I see.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.593
I see.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.129
How is she?

04:58.832 --> 05:00.899
Not she. Not anymore.

for you, then, sure...

05:10.944 --> 05:12.944
"It" she is.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.114
I should have done this
a long...

the FBI.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.194
It's just rocks again.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.598
Now there's nothing
you can do to me.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.606
And Emma?
Her being gone...

05:42.810 --> 05:44.609
Was that you?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.478
She's not here?

05:46.480 --> 05:50.615
Took off wearing that same
pretty dress she came in.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.551

05:52.553 --> 05:56.188
I figured you silver-tongued
her back to the
debutante ball.

05:56.190 --> 06:00.425
Oh, God.
She wanted to be free, I...

06:00.427 --> 06:02.394
Man, who's free?

Not her. Not you.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.633
Not anybody!

living in a prison they built.
