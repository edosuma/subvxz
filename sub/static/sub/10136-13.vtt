07:33.578 --> 07:35.663
See, y-you think I'm some

07:33.578 --> 07:35.663
kind of male chauvinist

07:35.705 --> 07:37.749
macho jerk, don't you?

07:37.791 --> 07:40.585
[chuckling]

07:37.791 --> 07:40.585
Okay, look, we can

07:37.791 --> 07:40.585
pick this up at dinner.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.422
- I'll see you guys tonight.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.422
- Okay.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.673
Bye.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.841
You guys?

07:45.715 --> 07:46.841
What do you mean "You guys?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.135
I'm not going to

07:46.883 --> 07:48.135
dinner with you.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.178
Well, I invited her

07:48.176 --> 07:50.178
over for dinner.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.763
- To our house?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.763
- Yeah.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.349
I gotta eat...she thinks

07:51.805 --> 07:54.349
I'm a macho jerk.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.018
Oh, come on, Jess.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.018
I really like Alison.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.437
You-you guys will get along.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.730
You're just, you're just not

07:58.478 --> 08:00.730
connecting right now.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.523
What am I

08:00.772 --> 08:02.523
supposed to do?

08:02.565 --> 08:04.776
Well, tonight at dinner,

08:02.565 --> 08:04.776
show her what a warm

08:04.818 --> 08:07.195
perfectly caring,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.195
sensitive man you are.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.030
[scoffing]

08:07.237 --> 08:09.030
Oh, great.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.366
After dinner, I'll nurse a poor

08:09.072 --> 08:11.366
little puppy back to health

08:11.408 --> 08:12.617
while watching

08:11.408 --> 08:12.617
"Beauty And The Beast"

08:12.659 --> 08:14.953
and I'll cry my little eyes out.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.621
Perfect.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.249
[instrumental music]

08:21.042 --> 08:25.088
Deej, I'm saved.

08:21.042 --> 08:25.088
I bought the new Teen Week.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.300
"Three easy steps to make your

08:25.130 --> 08:28.300
first date unforgettable."

08:28.342 --> 08:31.552
Mine sure was.

08:28.342 --> 08:31.552
Chinese food, a movie

08:31.594 --> 08:34.681
and my first ride

08:31.594 --> 08:34.681
in a police car.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.851
Okay.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.604
"Step number one. Dress to

08:37.892 --> 08:41.604
accentuate your best features."

08:41.646 --> 08:44.983
So you'll be wearing a mask.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.652
Yeah.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.652
Could I borrow that one?

08:47.694 --> 08:50.113
Oh, I'm sorry,

08:47.694 --> 08:50.113
it's your face.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.160
"Step two. Compliment your date

08:51.906 --> 08:55.160
on his appearance."

08:55.202 --> 08:56.953
What do you say

08:55.202 --> 08:56.953
if your date has pit stains

08:56.995 --> 08:59.414
and smells like a hamper?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.540
I don't know, Kimmy.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.750
What do your dates say to you?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.005
Let me see that.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.050
"Step number three.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.050
Concentrate on romance

09:10.091 --> 09:12.552
"because if you don't,

09:10.091 --> 09:12.552
he won't.

09:12.593 --> 09:13.761
"Follow these three steps

09:13.803 --> 09:15.138
"and your unforgettable

09:13.803 --> 09:15.138
first date

09:15.180 --> 09:18.225
will end with an unforgettable

09:15.180 --> 09:18.225
first kiss."

09:18.266 --> 09:20.852
Do you believe this?

09:23.021 --> 09:26.107
[instrumental music]

09:28.735 --> 09:30.404
Steve, you just had dinner.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.821
We're going out for pizza.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.740
- How can you still be eating?

09:31.863 --> 09:33.740
- I don't know.

09:33.781 --> 09:37.702
My mouth keeps moving and I

09:33.781 --> 09:37.702
gotta fill it with something.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.162
[doorbell ringing]

09:39.204 --> 09:41.748
That must be Stephanie's date.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.709
- Hi, Josh.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.709
- Hi.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.253
- Come on in.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.253
- 'How is it going, Josh?'

09:46.294 --> 09:48.213
I'll check and see

09:46.294 --> 09:48.213
how Stephanie's doing.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.299
There's fruit

09:48.255 --> 09:51.299
if you hurry.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.717
Have a seat, Josh.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.969
Part of dating is waiting.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.555
Dating?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.598
Steph and I are just going out

09:56.596 --> 09:58.598
for pizza with the guys.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.393
- Well, don't you like Steph?

09:58.639 --> 10:01.393
- Well, yeah, sure.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.144
You know,

10:01.435 --> 10:03.144
she likes to talk about

10:03.186 --> 10:04.938
pitching and baseball.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.273
She don't like to

10:04.979 --> 10:06.273
talk about that

10:06.314 --> 10:08.275
gushy stuff like other girls.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.444
Oh, Josh.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.245
Stephanie?

10:21.580 --> 10:23.498
Just a minute.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.921
Ready for

10:26.834 --> 10:29.921
an unforgettable evening?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.465
[chuckling nervously]

10:32.424 --> 10:35.510
[instrumental music]

10:38.472 --> 10:41.224
[instrumental music]

10:42.267 --> 10:44.644
[instrumental music]

10:46.229 --> 10:48.064
- Here's Josh!

10:46.229 --> 10:48.064
- Hey, come on, Steph.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.232
Let's go sit with the guys.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.442
You kids have have fun.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.944
We'll meet you

10:50.484 --> 10:52.944
at the car at 8:30.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.697
Steve.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.241
What?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.457
Josh, wouldn't you rather

11:03.163 --> 11:05.457
sit with D.J. and Steve

11:05.499 --> 11:07.834
in that nice,

11:05.499 --> 11:07.834
quiet booth?

11:07.875 --> 11:09.085
Why?

11:09.127 --> 11:11.212
Well, uh, the team's over

11:09.127 --> 11:11.212
by the door

11:11.254 --> 11:13.340
and the draft could tighten up

11:11.254 --> 11:13.340
my pitching arm.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.549
Do you want me

11:13.381 --> 11:14.549
to tell Coach Zwick

11:14.591 --> 11:17.552
it's your fault

11:14.591 --> 11:17.552
I can't pitch?

11:17.594 --> 11:19.720
The booth looks fine.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.516
Hi, guys.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.309
What are you doing here?

11:24.351 --> 11:25.852
We'd rather sit

11:24.351 --> 11:25.852
in the booth.

11:25.893 --> 11:29.314
Vinyl's so much cozier.

11:29.356 --> 11:33.652
So, Josh, I love the way

11:29.356 --> 11:33.652
that t-shirt looks on you.

11:33.692 --> 11:38.156
Really? It's got a big sloppy

11:33.692 --> 11:38.156
joe stain on it.

11:38.198 --> 11:42.536
Oh, well, it really brings out

11:38.198 --> 11:42.536
the color in your eyes.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.249
So what do you recommend?

11:48.291 --> 11:51.628
I recommend another table.

11:51.670 --> 11:52.920
Steph, I'm going to

11:51.670 --> 11:52.920
the bathroom.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.464
Do you want to join me?

11:54.506 --> 11:57.091
No, that's okay.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.091
Josh might get lonely.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.553
Hey, if you got to go,

11:57.133 --> 11:59.553
you got to go.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.348
She's definitely

12:00.845 --> 12:03.348
got to go.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.101
Stephanie, why are you sitting

12:04.891 --> 12:07.101
at our table?

12:07.143 --> 12:08.186
I thought you were

12:07.143 --> 12:08.186
gonna be sitting

12:08.228 --> 12:09.604
with your little friends.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.231
If we sit

12:09.646 --> 12:11.231
with the team, all Josh

12:11.272 --> 12:13.024
is gonna think

12:11.272 --> 12:13.024
about is baseball.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.775
I've got to make him

12:13.066 --> 12:14.775
think about romance.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.029
You saw the article.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.029
If I don't, he won't.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.573
Then sit by yourselves.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.116
I don't know anything

12:19.614 --> 12:22.116
about romance.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.245
I've got to follow your lead.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.245
Please, D.J.?

12:25.286 --> 12:27.330
Steph, why are you making this

12:25.286 --> 12:27.330
such a big deal out of this?

12:27.372 --> 12:29.999
Because you only go on

12:27.372 --> 12:29.999
your first date once.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.834
It's got to be perfect.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.628
Okay. But relax.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.963
Don't push so hard.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.882
By the way, it's me you're

12:36.005 --> 12:37.882
playing footsies with

12:37.924 --> 12:39.967
under the table.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.889
- I missed you, Deej.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.889
- I missed you too.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.182
I missed you, Josh.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.851
You were only gone

12:46.224 --> 12:48.851
for two seconds.

12:50.687 --> 12:54.357
Wow. Your hand's sweating

12:50.687 --> 12:54.357
like a pig.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.821
Oh, Josh, what a marvelous

12:57.193 --> 13:00.821
sense of humor.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.867
Steve, I really like that

13:02.490 --> 13:04.867
new cologne. What is it?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.661
Oh, it's called

13:04.909 --> 13:06.661
Wilderness Man.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.539
Comes with a free bag

13:06.703 --> 13:09.539
of beef jerky.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.543
I like your cologne

13:10.957 --> 13:13.543
too, Josh.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.793
I don't wear cologne.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.088
You're probably smelling

13:14.835 --> 13:17.088
my Denorex.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.966
Oh, well, it smells

13:17.130 --> 13:19.966
very manly..

13:22.761 --> 13:24.845
...even from up here.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.435
[instrumental music]

13:30.477 --> 13:33.104
I sure hope Jesse and Alison

13:30.477 --> 13:33.104
get along tonight.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.315
- She seems nice.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.315
- Oh, she's terrific.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.357
And now that I have

13:35.356 --> 13:36.357
asked her out

13:36.399 --> 13:38.401
I can finally

13:36.399 --> 13:38.401
relax around her.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.736
[clanking]

13:39.778 --> 13:42.405
Is that why your grading

13:39.778 --> 13:42.405
your watch band?

13:44.865 --> 13:47.744
This, here.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.663
Boy, everything smells so good.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.080
Thanks, Vicky.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.707
Oh, I just checked on

13:51.122 --> 13:52.707
Nicky and Alex.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.501
They're sleeping like babies,

13:52.749 --> 13:54.501
which is good

13:54.542 --> 13:56.085
because that's what they are .

13:56.127 --> 13:59.297
I guess it's

13:56.127 --> 13:59.297
the nurturing side of me.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.759
Or the side that didn't want

13:59.339 --> 14:02.759
to set the table.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.429
She's kidding.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.429
We-we kid each other.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.057
That's the-that's the kind

14:06.471 --> 14:10.057
of relationship we have.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.686
[chuckling]

14:14.479 --> 14:16.439
- Salad, Alison?

14:14.479 --> 14:16.439
- Ah!

14:16.481 --> 14:19.526
I'm so sor...uh..

14:23.404 --> 14:24.656
[timer ringing]

14:24.698 --> 14:26.783
I'll get that. I'll-I'll,

14:24.698 --> 14:26.783
uh...I'll be..

14:26.825 --> 14:28.951
Thanks, Joey.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.912
Alright, Vicky, I got

14:28.993 --> 14:31.912
a big surprise for you.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.581
Remember the first meal

14:31.954 --> 14:33.581
I ever cooked for you?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.208
You mean that

14:33.623 --> 14:35.208
mushed-up turkey

14:35.249 --> 14:37.794
with the pureed vegetables

14:35.249 --> 14:37.794
in that dough thing?

14:37.836 --> 14:40.797
Turkey in a boot.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.797
You remembered.

14:40.839 --> 14:44.050
Oh, boy, isn't this

14:40.839 --> 14:44.050
a beauty, huh?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.593
(Danny)

14:44.091 --> 14:45.593
'Joey!'

14:48.221 --> 14:50.724
Oh, my boot.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.643
My wonderful, crusty boot.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.730
Danny, I am so sorry. Listen,

14:53.685 --> 14:56.730
I'll-I'll take care of this.

14:56.771 --> 15:01.150
Uh, anyone for, uh,

14:56.771 --> 15:01.150
turkey in a loafer?

15:01.192 --> 15:03.653
Joey, forget about that.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.653
Let me, let me do it for you.

15:03.695 --> 15:08.783
Honey, honey, honey.

15:03.695 --> 15:08.783
Please, please, let me do it.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.493
I know you had

15:08.825 --> 15:10.493
a hard day at work today.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.286
Look, I'm not too macho

15:10.535 --> 15:12.286
to clean.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.038
How many times

15:12.328 --> 15:14.038
have I told you?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.207
Counting now, once.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.210
Again she kids.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.587
[chuckling]

15:22.380 --> 15:25.508
Vicky, I-I am so sorry.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.595
I know turkey in a boot

15:25.550 --> 15:28.595
is your favorite meal.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.972
Sweetheart, it's not

15:28.636 --> 15:31.972
my favorite.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.850
What?

15:33.892 --> 15:34.934
The first time

15:33.892 --> 15:34.934
I made it for you

15:34.975 --> 15:36.477
you said you loved it.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.187
I lied.

15:38.229 --> 15:42.400
The truth is

15:38.229 --> 15:42.400
it tastes like it sounds.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.735
I'm sorry.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.152
We'd just started

15:43.777 --> 15:45.152
going out and I didn't

15:45.194 --> 15:46.946
want to hurt

15:45.194 --> 15:46.946
your feelings.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.698
I'm sure there's some little

15:46.987 --> 15:48.698
fibs you've told me

15:48.740 --> 15:51.242
to spare my feelings.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.244
Yeah, remember

15:51.284 --> 15:53.244
when I told you that

15:53.286 --> 15:56.289
I liked that pink pullover

15:53.286 --> 15:56.289
you knitted for me?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.999
You didn't like

15:56.330 --> 15:58.999
that sweater?

15:59.041 --> 16:00.418
I didn't like it.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.921
I loved it!

16:06.883 --> 16:09.427
Did I miss

16:06.883 --> 16:09.427
a food fight?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.721
No, just a little

16:09.469 --> 16:11.721
accident, Michelle.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.932
Uh, Michelle..

16:11.763 --> 16:13.932
Excuse me, Jess.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.684
Uh, this is Alison.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.684
Alison, Michelle.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.937
- Hi.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.937
- Hi, Michelle.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.396
Joey.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.273
Yeah, yeah.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.691
What?

16:24.609 --> 16:26.360
What are you doing?

16:26.402 --> 16:27.821
You feel cool.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.030
You said that you had

16:27.862 --> 16:30.030
the hots for her.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.658
[chuckling]

16:37.455 --> 16:40.708
Well, maybe you

16:37.455 --> 16:40.708
misunderstood me.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.378
You're Alison, right?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.839
Yes.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.591
He has the hots for you.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.218
[laughing nervously]

16:54.597 --> 16:58.685
Oh, boy, we'll always remember

16:54.597 --> 16:58.685
our first date.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.520
Joey, we're not on a date.

17:00.561 --> 17:05.065
I thought I was just

17:00.561 --> 17:05.065
coming over for dinner.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.734
Boy, will you look

17:05.107 --> 17:06.734
at the time?

17:06.776 --> 17:08.987
Michelle, you have to

17:06.776 --> 17:08.987
go to bed, don't you?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.489
- Bye, everyone.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.489
- Was is something I said?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.826
Nothing you said at all. No.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.203
This is really embarrassing.

17:17.244 --> 17:20.122
Um, maybe this wasn't

17:17.244 --> 17:20.122
such a good idea.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.082
It's nice meeting you.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.544
Nice meeting you too.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.838
Alison.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.922
Alison, hold on a second.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.382
No, I really should be going.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.551
Alison, you got to give

17:29.423 --> 17:31.551
Joey a second chance.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.053
I mean, he's-he's

17:31.592 --> 17:34.053
really a nice guy.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.848
I know he's a nice guy.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.350
Sit down here a second.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.853
So, what you don't know

17:39.392 --> 17:41.853
is how much he likes you.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.938
I mean, sometimes it's-it's

17:41.895 --> 17:43.938
hard for us guys

17:43.980 --> 17:45.899
to show our feelings, you know.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.859
I mean...occasionally,

17:45.940 --> 17:47.859
it comes out in a weird way.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.402
I mean instead

17:47.901 --> 17:49.402
of Joey just saying

17:49.443 --> 17:50.653
you know, "hey, Alison

17:49.443 --> 17:50.653
I dig you"

17:50.695 --> 17:52.989
he-he dumps salad

17:50.695 --> 17:52.989
all over you.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.991
It certainly got

17:53.031 --> 17:54.991
my attention.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.576
Listen, I love Joey.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.119
I mean, I...I mean I really

17:56.617 --> 17:59.119
love Joey like a brother.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.330
He's-he's the warmest,

17:59.161 --> 18:01.330
sweetest guy.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.583
He's like a big, big teddy bear

18:01.372 --> 18:03.583
that you just want to hug.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.877
And I promised, once you get to

18:03.624 --> 18:05.877
know him, you'll love him too.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.629
I swear to you.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.090
Jesse, I have something

18:08.671 --> 18:11.090
to say.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.383
Am I in trouble again?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.134
No.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.804
I think I really misjudged you.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.389
You're a such a good friend

18:16.846 --> 18:18.389
to Joey.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.727
And you're so open and in touch

18:18.431 --> 18:22.727
with your feelings.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
Well, it's no biggie.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.273
I guess it's just, uh..

18:27.314 --> 18:30.526
...just the kind

18:27.314 --> 18:30.526
of guy I am.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.028
I really feel like

18:30.568 --> 18:32.028
I've been talking

18:32.070 --> 18:33.153
to one of my girlfriends.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.573
That's not

18:33.195 --> 18:35.573
the kind of guy I am.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.241
Oh, great, Alison,

18:35.615 --> 18:37.241
you're still here.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.201
Joey, good. Listen, uh..

18:39.243 --> 18:40.745
Why don't you two guys, uh..

18:40.787 --> 18:41.955
...sit down and talk

18:40.787 --> 18:41.955
to each other?

18:41.996 --> 18:44.457
Really, sit down,

18:41.996 --> 18:44.457
talk a little

18:44.498 --> 18:47.251
enjoy each other, go.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.510
Alison, look,

18:53.716 --> 18:56.510
I'm, uh, I'm really sorry

18:56.552 --> 18:58.554
if I came on too strong.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.306
I just want to assure you

18:58.596 --> 19:00.306
that in the future

19:00.347 --> 19:01.891
all of our dealings will be

19:01.933 --> 19:04.936
strictly on

19:01.933 --> 19:04.936
a professional level.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.939
So, uh, goodnight, um..

19:07.981 --> 19:10.316
...sir.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.069
Joey.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.404
It doesn't have anything

19:13.111 --> 19:15.404
to do with you.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.824
I just came off

19:15.446 --> 19:17.824
a bad relationship

19:17.865 --> 19:19.951
and I just need

19:17.865 --> 19:19.951
a little more time.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.913
How's that?

19:22.036 --> 19:23.913
Is that good?

19:23.955 --> 19:25.498
More than that.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.960
Uh, it's okay, I can wait.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.960
Don't worry.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.461
So you must be starving.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.754
I think there's something

19:30.503 --> 19:31.754
in the kitchen

19:31.796 --> 19:34.799
I haven't thrown

19:31.796 --> 19:34.799
on the floor yet.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.216
(Danny)

19:34.841 --> 19:36.216
'Coffee, anyone?'

19:36.258 --> 19:38.594
- Here we go. Yeah

19:36.258 --> 19:38.594
- Sure.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.221
(Danny)

19:40.138 --> 19:41.221
'Joey!'

19:41.263 --> 19:42.306
[plates clanking]

19:42.348 --> 19:45.351
Ohh...ohh, bad luck.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.770
Uh..

19:47.812 --> 19:51.273
Maybe we should go to like

19:47.812 --> 19:51.273
a-a rubber-padded restaurant

19:51.315 --> 19:53.109
some place where I can't

19:51.315 --> 19:53.109
break anything.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.319
And we'll go

19:53.151 --> 19:55.319
and have dessert.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.740
[cricket chirping]

20:01.159 --> 20:03.870
[dog barking at distance]

20:03.911 --> 20:06.539
You think they're

20:03.911 --> 20:06.539
going to be through soon?

20:06.580 --> 20:09.083
Steve's got to

20:06.580 --> 20:09.083
drive me home.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.711
Well, while we're waiting,

20:09.125 --> 20:11.711
you know what would be

20:11.752 --> 20:15.131
the perfect end

20:11.752 --> 20:15.131
to a perfect evening?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.257
You're going to teach me

20:15.173 --> 20:17.257
how to throw a knuckleball?

20:18.384 --> 20:21.679
No, I was thinking

20:18.384 --> 20:21.679
more of..

20:27.977 --> 20:30.021
What did you do that for?

20:31.147 --> 20:33.232
I don't know.

20:35.193 --> 20:38.362
Steve, I'd better go

20:35.193 --> 20:38.362
talk to her.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.492
Steve, do you

20:40.573 --> 20:43.492
understand women?

20:43.534 --> 20:46.787
Well, enough not to wipe my

20:43.534 --> 20:46.787
mouth off when they kiss me.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.292
Steph, are you okay?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.461
This was the worst night

20:52.334 --> 20:54.461
of my life.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.839
Shh. You'll wake up Michelle.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.551
Too late, Michelle's awake.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.344
I need to talk

21:00.593 --> 21:02.344
to Stephanie.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.014
Good. Then I'll help.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.100
Steph, I know

21:05.056 --> 21:07.100
how you're feeling.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.684
You're hurt and confused.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.311
You forgot

21:08.726 --> 21:11.311
humiliated, crushed

21:11.353 --> 21:13.856
and scarred for life.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.566
Steph, don't take it so hard.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.026
It was only your first date.

21:17.068 --> 21:21.030
And my last. I'm never leaving

21:17.068 --> 21:21.030
this room again.

21:21.072 --> 21:24.450
Not even to go

21:21.072 --> 21:24.450
to the bathroom?

21:24.491 --> 21:25.868
Michelle.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.620
What was I thinking?

21:27.661 --> 21:29.205
Why did I kiss him?

21:29.247 --> 21:32.166
You kissed a boy?

21:32.208 --> 21:35.461
Eew! Cooties!

21:35.502 --> 21:38.589
Michelle, let me handle this.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.758
Okay.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.385
But you're not doing

21:40.800 --> 21:43.385
a very good job.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.015
Steph, why did you

21:45.345 --> 21:48.015
kiss Josh?

21:48.057 --> 21:51.477
I don't know.

21:48.057 --> 21:51.477
I thought I was supposed to.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.353
That's what you and Steve do.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.355
That's what it said

21:53.395 --> 21:55.355
in Teen Week.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.441
Steph, you're not a teen.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.944
And Steve and I do it

21:57.483 --> 21:59.944
because we want to

21:59.986 --> 22:02.446
not because

21:59.986 --> 22:02.446
we're supposed to.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.782
Well, how do you know

22:02.488 --> 22:04.782
when you want to

22:04.824 --> 22:08.368
and he wants to, and how to

22:04.824 --> 22:08.368
and how long to?

22:08.410 --> 22:10.579
I can't explain it.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.915
When you're ready,

22:10.621 --> 22:12.915
you'll know.

22:12.957 --> 22:16.460
All I know is,

22:12.957 --> 22:16.460
I was not ready tonight.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.963
Steph, that's not

22:16.502 --> 22:18.963
a bad thing.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.632
It was tonight.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.468
You were just trying

22:21.674 --> 22:24.468
go too fast.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.761
It was partly my fault.

22:25.803 --> 22:28.181
I never should have told you

22:25.803 --> 22:28.181
it was a date.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.683
Josh was just a friend

22:28.222 --> 22:30.683
that wanted to hang out.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.102
That's what I thought

22:30.724 --> 22:33.102
in the first place.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.394
[sighing]

22:34.436 --> 22:36.522
You think Josh will ever

22:34.436 --> 22:36.522
talk to me again?

22:36.563 --> 22:39.566
Of course, he will.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.566
You're pretty.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.111
You're smart. You're funny.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.071
Really? You think so?

22:44.113 --> 22:46.406
Sure, I do, and

22:44.113 --> 22:46.406
you're the only one

22:46.448 --> 22:49.535
who can teach him

22:46.448 --> 22:49.535
that knuckleball.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.829
Thanks, Deej.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.829
You're the best.
