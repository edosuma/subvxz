WEBVTT

00:55.359 --> 00:57.361
Wow!

00:57.405 --> 00:58.493
Would anyone
like eggs?
Ah!

00:58.536 --> 01:00.625
Yes, please.
Why, yes.
Thank you.

01:01.757 --> 01:05.369
Mmm! These are eggcellent,
Mrs. Boonchuy.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.893
Yes. Thank you for
the delicious food.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.156
Oh, you're
very welcome.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.157
Hey!

01:11.984 --> 01:13.725
Good morning, fam-fam.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.162
Ooh! Eggs!

01:17.294 --> 01:20.515
Hmm. These could use
a little something.
Got any hot sauce?

01:20.558 --> 01:22.908
- Sure. I'll get--
- Whoo-hoo!

01:22.952 --> 01:24.606
Don't worry, Mrs. B.
I got it.

01:26.347 --> 01:27.391
Aha!

01:35.965 --> 01:38.359
Sprig, can we chat?

01:38.402 --> 01:40.709
Dude,
what are you doing?
What do you mean?

01:40.752 --> 01:43.407
Sprig Plantar, you're a guest
in the Boonchuys' home.

01:43.451 --> 01:46.018
For frog's sake,
behave like one.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.759
Silly Hop Pop.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.414
We're not guests.
We're family.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.850
No, we're not!

01:51.894 --> 01:53.591
Just because Anne
is a Plantar

01:53.635 --> 01:56.159
doesn't automatically
make you a Boonchuy.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.857
Doesn't it though?
I mean, the math
checks out.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.772
You're not a part
of Anne's family!

02:00.816 --> 02:04.341
Oh. Anne, is that true?

02:04.385 --> 02:08.345
Don't worry about it, man.
Being a guest around here
is so much better.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.739
Being family just means
chores, responsibilities

02:10.782 --> 02:12.567
and getting yelled at
when you mess up.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.265
I, for one, like being
waited on hand and foot.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.614
And I should know.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.964
I have feet now.

02:19.008 --> 02:22.229
Sorry, guys. I just always
wanted a bigger family.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.056
And I guess I got
a little carried away.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.188
Been there.
Hey, no problem.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.582
You course corrected.
Anne, come on.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.888
We have a lot of work
to do at the restaurant.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.369
Well, that's me.
See you guys
when I get back.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.805
Oh, wait!

02:33.849 --> 02:35.198
Can I come with you?

02:35.242 --> 02:37.635
I'd like to make up
for how rude I was
this morning.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.681
I guess that'd be fine.
Hop Pop, Polly.

02:39.724 --> 02:43.467
Try to research some portals
and junk while we're gone.
You got it.

02:43.511 --> 02:47.123
So are we watching <i>Starzgate
or Quantum Hop?</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:49.212
<i>Quantum Hop!
Quantum Hop!</i>

02:54.304 --> 02:57.046
How can I help?
How can I help?
How can I help?

02:57.089 --> 02:59.483
Don't worry about it,
pink frog. You're our guest.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.399
Why don't you sit in the corner
with a Thai ice tea?

03:02.443 --> 03:06.708
I hate being
a stupid guest.
I wanna be family.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.582
Yes!

03:11.626 --> 03:13.497
Oops!

03:13.541 --> 03:15.195
Sounds like we've got
a customer.
Heh?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.415
What's happening,
Boonchuys?

03:18.459 --> 03:20.461
Anne! Whoa!

03:20.504 --> 03:22.419
I thought
you were dead.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.421
Ned!
Check it out, Sprig.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.423
This guy's our
number one customer.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.903
He's been around
for years.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.687
Wow!
Oh.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.255
And I'm not just
a customer anymore,
Anne.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.431
- Wait. What?
- I bought a food truck.

03:34.475 --> 03:37.608
I wanna bring
your mom's amazing cooking
to all of LA.

03:37.652 --> 03:40.307
She puts the pow
in pad kra pao!

03:40.350 --> 03:42.483
Oh, neat. You guys are
in business together?

03:42.526 --> 03:44.528
Well... no.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.878
Not yet.

03:46.922 --> 03:50.926
I already told you.
We're just not interested
in a food truck.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.494
But you've got
the best Thai food
in the county.

03:53.537 --> 03:57.280
And if we partnered up,
we could make so much money
together.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.761
Couldn't you just share some
of your recipes with me?

03:59.804 --> 04:03.417
Absolutely not. This recipe
are for family only.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.377
Well,
when you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

04:10.162 --> 04:13.296
Wow. He's literally parked
right outside the restaurant.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.342
That can't be good.
It's not.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.561
Customers are very
confused right now.

04:17.605 --> 04:18.780
Ah.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.129
Huh. Huh?

04:21.130 --> 04:24.351
I don't--

04:24.394 --> 04:26.788
What do I do?

04:26.831 --> 04:29.094
He means well.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.532
But Ned just doesn't realize
he's hurting the business.

04:31.575 --> 04:34.099
It's been weeks,
and he still
hasn't budged.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.580
Oh, well. I better start
the khao pad.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.409
Hmm. Tough problem, huh?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.324
Why, if someone were
to solve it,

04:41.368 --> 04:44.371
your mom might consider him
the son she never had.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.416
Sprig,
stay out of this.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.853
Okay, okay. Sheesh.
It was just a thought.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.771
Ow.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.427
Here you go.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.083
Next!

05:03.085 --> 05:04.739
Oh. Hi, kid.
What'll it be?

05:04.782 --> 05:07.437
Give me the special.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.351
Sure thing.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.833
Two egg rolls and a bowl
of pad thai coming up.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.839
Oh, my frog!

05:17.882 --> 05:22.191
This food...
it's turned me pink!

05:23.975 --> 05:26.543
- Hey, I wouldn't mind
being pink.
- Heh?

05:26.587 --> 05:30.199
Maybe it will help me
with my next <i>Star Trip</i> audition.

05:30.242 --> 05:33.158
Excuse me. I'll have
whatever he had.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.203
Sure thing.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.770
What? You fools!

05:35.813 --> 05:38.599
That was a lie.
You're all morons.

05:38.642 --> 05:41.166
Who you calling
a moron?

05:45.257 --> 05:48.217
Morons,
morons, morons!

05:49.261 --> 05:51.307
Morons! Morons!
Whoa!

05:51.351 --> 05:55.050
Oh, hey, while you're in there,
could you grab those recipes?

05:59.010 --> 06:01.491
Anne, this behavior
is unacceptable.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.364
I'm doubling your chores.
Don't let it happen again.

06:06.322 --> 06:09.194
Wait. Why'd she yell at you
for something I did?

06:09.238 --> 06:12.502
She's not about
to yell at a guest, Sprig.
She only yells at family.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.418
Ouch, Anne.
Thanks for rubbing it in.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.289
Look, Sprig, I know
what you're doing here.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.422
And I get why.
But please stop.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.860
Or I'll be cleaning
the bathroom with a toothbrush
for the rest of my life.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.080
Just knock it off,
okay?

06:25.123 --> 06:28.997
Knock it off
or knock it on?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.259
I heard that!

06:30.302 --> 06:31.391
No, you didn't!

06:48.756 --> 06:52.281
Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Finally!

06:52.324 --> 06:54.501
Ned's gonna get ahead,
baby!

06:54.544 --> 06:57.504
Oh!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.990
And now to destroy
an earth man's livelihood.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.133
Oh, no.

07:18.176 --> 07:22.050
Sprig Boonchuy
in three, two, one.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.356
No, Sprig! Bad Sprig!
What are you doing?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.576
Squirming my way
into your mom's heart

07:26.620 --> 07:28.448
by making this food truck
disappear.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.493
Not on my watch.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.328
Ned, I don't have time
for this nonsense.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.851
Um, but your note said--

07:40.895 --> 07:42.549
Note? What note?

07:43.550 --> 07:45.508
Wait. Mrs. B?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.641
Pink frog!

07:47.684 --> 07:48.729
Huh?

07:51.645 --> 07:52.950
My food truck!
Your food truck!

07:56.780 --> 07:57.477
Hmm?

07:58.826 --> 08:00.697
Holy crab apple!

08:00.741 --> 08:02.612
When did we
start moving?

08:02.656 --> 08:05.397
Okay,
I've never driven a car,
but I have driven Bessie.

08:05.441 --> 08:07.399
And played 900 hours
of Super Wario Carts.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.531
Anne, look out!

08:10.185 --> 08:12.404
Uh-- Uh-- Brakes!
Gotta mash the brakes!

08:15.625 --> 08:16.583
The brakes aren't working!

08:19.760 --> 08:20.978
Ned!

08:21.022 --> 08:22.719
It's okay, Anne. I've got this.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.939
Whoa, girl! Whoa!

08:24.982 --> 08:26.680
Dude, that only works
on snails!

08:31.685 --> 08:32.773
Whew.
Whew. Huh?

08:32.816 --> 08:34.818
Oh, no!

08:40.171 --> 08:42.130
Thanks for letting me
borrow your TV.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.959
Just be careful.
This thing is like
a son to me.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.570
Junior!

08:50.704 --> 08:52.706
Idea. Sprig,
I need your help.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.795
Use that tongue
and help me make
a hard left.

08:54.838 --> 08:55.970
Got it!

08:59.669 --> 09:01.236
- Whoa!

09:10.114 --> 09:14.641
[Anne, Sprig screaming,
grunting] Whoa!

09:23.432 --> 09:25.434
I don't believe it.

09:25.477 --> 09:26.522
We...

09:26.566 --> 09:27.567
...did it!

09:28.655 --> 09:30.265
I don't believe this.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.268
Me either.
You send your daughter
to destroy my truck?

09:33.311 --> 09:34.617
What?
Are you people insane?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.750
Anne had nothing
to do with this.

09:36.793 --> 09:37.751
It was all me.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.100
I was just--

09:41.145 --> 09:44.192
I just wanted
to be a part
of the family.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.063
But I should've respected
your boundaries

09:46.107 --> 09:48.718
instead of pestering you
into something you didn't want.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.852
It's okay,
pink frog.

09:51.895 --> 09:55.333
I mean, Sprig. I know
how much you mean
to my daughter.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.074
And how much
she means to you.

09:58.859 --> 10:02.906
I probably shouldn't
have treated you
like such an outsider.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.869
I feel like
an outsider too.

10:08.912 --> 10:11.915
I love your restaurant
so much.

10:11.959 --> 10:15.005
I just wanted
to be a part of it.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.704
But-- But I was wrong.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.709
I'm so sorry.
I'm done trying
to get your recipes.

10:22.752 --> 10:26.800
I just realized this
is a gross appropriation
of your culture.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.672
And I should just
show myself out.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.370
Ned, look.

10:32.414 --> 10:35.678
I can't give you
the recipes because
they are for family only.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.725
But we could use some help
with deliveries.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.162
De-- Deliver? Me?

10:41.205 --> 10:44.774
I mean, it won't pay much,
but you will be part
of the restaurant.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.951
Yes! I'd love to. Oh,
you will not regret it,
Mrs. Boonchuy.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.083
Not for a second.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.737
Whoo-hoo! Yay!

10:50.780 --> 10:52.695
I'll make you guys proud!

10:52.739 --> 10:55.263
Oh, man. I got to get
these brakes fixed.

10:55.306 --> 10:58.179
Welp, I guess
we're all done here.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.833
Not so fast.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.792
If you think you're getting out
of here without an earful,

11:02.836 --> 11:04.576
you've got another
thing coming.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.275
Firstly,
how dare you disobey me?

11:07.318 --> 11:10.713
Secondly, how dare you
put Anne and yourself
in danger?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.759
Thirdly,
why are you smiling?

11:12.802 --> 11:16.850
You're-- You're scolding me,
which means...

11:16.893 --> 11:18.547
Yep.
You're family now, bud.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.290
Yay!

11:22.333 --> 11:24.814
Already having
second thoughts
about this.
