WEBVTT

03:43.223 --> 03:44.933
Good morning, Constable.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.086
Well done, Steed.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.462
My pleasure.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.008
But the nuns were a surprise.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.343
We try.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.476
You never can tell-

05:09.601 --> 05:11.478
When the enemy will strike.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.647
If we still have an enemy.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.651
There's always an enemy, Steed.
You just have to know where to look.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.655
Something's up at The Ministry.
They want you to meet somebody.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.949
Well, they know where to find me.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.326
Macaroons...

05:27.411 --> 05:28.662
...for Mother.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.849
Good morning, Prime Minister.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.934
Yes, Prime Minister.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.813
The Prospero Program weather shield
is down.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.482
Yes, all of it.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.359
The entire grid.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.655
Yes, it's bad.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.742
Right away.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.844
Dr. Peel?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.030
"Please answer the telephone. "

06:52.037 --> 06:55.082
Good morning, Dr. Peel.
We've scheduled an appointment for you.

06:55.165 --> 06:59.086
John Steed. Boodle's Gentlemen's Club.
One hour. Thank you.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.147
May I help you, madam?

07:19.231 --> 07:21.608
For Mr. John Steed, I'm Dr. Peel.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.443
I'm afraid that's impossible.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.445
- You are female.
- As you see.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.656
Then you can't come in.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.658
I have an appointment.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.202
No women.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.330
- Not in Boodle's. Not since 1762.
- Really?

07:49.094 --> 07:50.929
Dr. Peel, I presume.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.474
And you must be Steed.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.978
- Please don't get up.
- And I was about to throw in the towel.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.605
Spot of bother at the door.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.150
Well, I shouldn't wonder.
Not a woman inside Boodle's since-

08:03.233 --> 08:04.401
1762.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.447
So what was all this? Some sort of test?

08:08.530 --> 08:12.034
Congratulations. You've entered
a bastion of male privilege.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.328
You're not someone
who plays by the rules.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.330
Rules are made to be broken.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.415
Not by me.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.378
Play by the rules, Doctor,
or the game is nothing.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.464
And just what is the game?

08:25.589 --> 08:28.634
This is all terribly formal.
Must I go on calling you Dr. Peel?

08:28.717 --> 08:29.718
No, no.

08:29.801 --> 08:33.013
Under the circumstances,
you may call me Mrs. Peel.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.347
Much better.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.475
Now that we've settled
the matter of titles...

08:36.558 --> 08:38.936
...will you kindly explain
why you wished to meet me?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.938
I didn't. Mother did.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.688
"Mother?"

08:43.065 --> 08:44.066
Mother.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.986
Four o'clock. Mustn't be late.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.029
Time for tea?

08:49.112 --> 08:52.658
Word of warning Don't take
the macaroon. Mother's favorite.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.632
You are now entering a restricted area.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.892
I always prefer a room with a view,
don't you? Tea?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.228
I know about the Prospero incident.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.855
Sugar, one lump.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.983
- Is that why I'm here?
- You're here for tea, Mrs. Peel.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.610
Welcome to The Ministry. Macaroon?

09:38.662 --> 09:41.665
Prospero. Prospero.
Shakespeare's magician.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.500
Do explain.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.502
Top-secret research.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.423
A government project I was working on
to create a weather shield.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.300
A defensive umbrella.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.135
I get it.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.679
Someone attacks, we put up this...

09:56.805 --> 09:57.890
...umbrella...

09:57.973 --> 10:00.517
...everyone goes home for tea. Marvelous.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.645
Until someone blows up the research lab.

10:04.813 --> 10:05.898
But did they just walk in?

10:06.023 --> 10:08.859
- How did they get past security?
- That's what's interesting.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.613
Security cameras at the Prospero lab
picked up a picture during the attack.

10:12.738 --> 10:15.199
Something I'd like you to see,
if you have a moment.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.408
After tea.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.619
Of course.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.550
Well, she looks terribly familiar.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.388
You're our chief suspect.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.603
I'm innocent, of course.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.064
Or guilty until proven innocent.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.484
- Why would I sabotage my own project?
- You tell us.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.987
Looks like me.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.116
But it isn't.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.705
You will be allowed the privilege
to prove your innocence.

11:03.956 --> 11:07.251
If you didn't blow up Prospero,
find out who did.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.295
Mother would like me
to show you the ropes.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.923
He'd like us to work as a team.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.301
You mean I have to trust you?

11:16.635 --> 11:18.428
Absolutely, Mrs. Peel.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.349
Shall we?

11:35.153 --> 11:37.322
Do you think Mrs. Peel is dangerous,
Father?

11:37.406 --> 11:39.491
All in my report, Mother.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.618
Why haven't I read it?

11:41.785 --> 11:43.954
Because I haven't given it to you.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.374
My theory goes Mrs. Peel may be ill.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.917
Amnesia?

11:49.084 --> 11:50.669
Possibly a split personality.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.505
Maybe trauma. There was a husband.
Test pilot.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.049
Missing over the Amazon. Presumed dead.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.551
He was one of ours.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.511
Revenge is a possible motive.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.763
She certainly fits our profile.

12:02.973 --> 12:06.518
- How could you have released her?
- Mrs. Peel is our only lead.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.063
Either she'll lead us to the real enemy...

12:10.272 --> 12:11.982
...or they'll find her.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.410
We were bombarding protons and ions
to make antimatter.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.873
I shall have to start calling you
"Doctor" again.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.462
Artificially creating new weather systems.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.594
You're a lady of hidden talents, Mrs. Peel.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.439
A little more flexibility in the wrist.

12:59.780 --> 13:00.948
Scientist...

13:04.368 --> 13:05.619
...swordsman.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.789
To what do you attribute
your overachievements?

13:10.457 --> 13:13.085
- My father always wanted a boy.
- Oh, really?

13:16.755 --> 13:18.131
I fail to see the connection.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.592
I had a feeling you would. So did he.

13:31.895 --> 13:32.896
TouchÃ©.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.652
The ebony handles are a touch heavy,
Trubshaw.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.904
I'll stick to the rosewood.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.283
Excellent, sir. If you'd step this way...

13:46.076 --> 13:49.830
Now my knight has chosen his armor.
Shouldn't we be on our way?

13:50.372 --> 13:52.666
Well, Trubshaw's a man worth meeting.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.626
No point in setting out half-shod.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.671
That's why I ordered you a pair
of boots, Mrs. Peel.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.839
Thank you.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.342
I hope your shoes and waistcoat
please you, sir.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.428
- Impeccable.
- Quite.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.681
Your items will be delivered
to the usual address.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.184
Mrs. Peel's boots?

14:11.643 --> 14:13.395
- Send them on.
- Of course.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.941
Mother suggested we go for a spin.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.485
- Do you always listen to Mother?
- That depends.

14:20.611 --> 14:23.238
Marvelous weather.
Not the sort of day to be stuck in town.

14:23.322 --> 14:25.324
- I think we ought to get away.
- "We?"

14:25.407 --> 14:26.783
Yes, just the two of us.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.828
A weekend in the country,
long walks, the wind in your hair.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.206
- How about it?
- Depends what you have in mind.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.750
I'm a nature lover,
so whatever comes naturally.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.502
Should we take my car?

14:48.305 --> 14:49.473
That's odd.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.558
Rusty, perhaps?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.478
I hope I haven't lost the knack.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.951
Is the pot warm?

15:09.076 --> 15:10.077
Always.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.497
- Milk?
- Lemon, just a twist.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.209
No cakes, I'm afraid.
You don't mind roughing it, do you?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.544
On the contrary.

15:18.669 --> 15:21.463
- Should we be making plans for tonight?
- We are.

15:21.547 --> 15:25.384
I thought we'd have time to pay a
social visit, since we happen to be passing.

15:25.509 --> 15:26.885
I thought as much.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.638
- Anyone in particular?
- Sir August de Wynter.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.099
Former Ministry man,
head of Special Projects.

15:32.182 --> 15:35.519
Ran our Strategic Deception Initiative.
He's retired now.

15:35.894 --> 15:36.979
Very rich.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.355
Very odd.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.648
Intriguing.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.568
- A wealthy recluse.
- More interesting than that.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.946
Sir August's a fanatical meteorologist.
It runs in the family.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.949
Mother called April, sisters May, June-

15:49.157 --> 15:50.659
July, August.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.413
The family does have weather on the brain.
Any other vices?

15:54.496 --> 15:57.916
All of a piece, really.
Sir August's chairman of BROLLY

15:58.375 --> 16:01.044
British Royal Organization
for Lasting Liquid Years.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.589
It's a private group
recruiting top scientists.

16:03.714 --> 16:06.758
He thinks British weather has been
tampered with by aliens.

16:06.842 --> 16:09.219
They're not too keen on him
at The Ministry.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.221
- Mother tells me he left under-
- A cloud?

16:11.305 --> 16:12.181
Naturally.

16:12.264 --> 16:15.851
If it wouldn't be too much bother,
could you charm him a little?

16:16.185 --> 16:17.895
I'll see what I can do.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.563
More tea?

16:19.688 --> 16:20.564
No, thanks.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.732
I meant me.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.406
I'll snoop around.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.617
You distract him.

16:31.909 --> 16:32.910
How?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.161
Try...

16:34.453 --> 16:35.704
...small talk.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.997
The weather?

16:37.080 --> 16:39.958
Maybe something more feminine.
A woman's touch.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.920
- That should do it.
- Think so?

16:43.086 --> 16:45.172
Your confidence is overwhelming.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.590
Such modesty.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.218
A minor talent. Or hadn't you noticed?

18:13.218 --> 18:14.219
Curious.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.762
- Miss?
- Mrs.

18:16.555 --> 18:17.556
Mrs.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.313
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

18:26.857 --> 18:27.858
Hello?

18:40.787 --> 18:41.788
Hello?

18:50.672 --> 18:51.673
Hello?

18:58.347 --> 18:59.348
Hello?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.311
Peel.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.188
Emma Peel.

19:09.399 --> 19:10.651
You're all wet.

19:12.444 --> 19:15.489
Have we met, or is it just the rain
that's familiar?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.575
We share a passion, I believe.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.120
I have always admired a woman who is...

19:22.496 --> 19:24.414
...meteorologically inclined.

19:24.957 --> 19:26.416
Mutual, I'm sure.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.545
The thrill of the monsoon?

19:29.628 --> 19:31.421
Ah, yes, the monsoons.

19:31.755 --> 19:35.425
Even as a boy, when Nana taught me
the naming of the clouds...

19:36.009 --> 19:37.344
- Cumulus.
- Yes.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.304
- Stratocumulus.
- Oh, yes.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.430
Nimbus.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.767
I discovered then,
nothing beats a good lashing.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.185
Mind your head.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.562
Take India.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.773
You can have a good ten inches
overnight there.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.358
You know...

19:51.692 --> 19:53.527
...one should never fear...

19:54.653 --> 19:55.904
...being wet.

19:58.532 --> 19:59.783
Come this way.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.328
Allow me.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.830
These rapid climate changes.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.708
- The Ministry needs some answers.
- Oh, that Ministry!

20:07.791 --> 20:09.710
Dry enough, don't you think?

20:10.586 --> 20:11.753
Do you mind?

20:12.254 --> 20:13.338
Very well.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.799
I need a specialist's opinion.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.760
Theoretically speaking,
if I wanted to alter cloud patterns...

20:18.844 --> 20:20.846
...how would I power it?
By microtransmission?

20:20.929 --> 20:22.723
Yes, by microtransmission.

20:22.806 --> 20:26.393
The military applications were never
looked into after the Cold War.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.478
The hot and the cold war.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.022
Hot and cold war?

20:30.147 --> 20:31.231
An outdated theory.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.941
Intriguing, but impossible.

20:33.025 --> 20:34.610
Nothing is impossible!

20:34.860 --> 20:37.070
Only mathematically improbable.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.365
My dear Dr. Peel, look here.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.911
The twisted labellum.

20:46.038 --> 20:49.208
Note the upturned apiculus
on the dorsal sepal.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.543
A genetic impossibility.

20:51.627 --> 20:53.712
That flower should not exist...

20:54.004 --> 20:55.506
...yet there she is.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.925
I did it.

21:02.930 --> 21:04.181
Beautiful, no?

21:07.392 --> 21:08.936
Touch it, Dr. Peel.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.271
I feel I'm wasting my time.

21:11.355 --> 21:12.856
No, please touch it.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.485
I'm sorry to trouble you.
It's obvious you know nothing.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.529
I know nothing?

21:19.363 --> 21:23.200
I have forgotten more than those fools
at The Ministry ever knew!

21:25.202 --> 21:27.579
The ratio of protons to ions...

21:28.455 --> 21:29.414
...me!

21:29.832 --> 21:32.543
The entire Microtransmission Theory...

21:32.876 --> 21:33.794
...me!

21:33.877 --> 21:35.295
I did it all!

21:36.630 --> 21:37.714
Tea?

22:16.712 --> 22:17.671
Hello?

22:19.423 --> 22:20.340
Hello?

22:20.424 --> 22:22.968
Private property. No trespassing.

22:23.427 --> 22:24.970
Sorry! I can't hear you!

22:25.053 --> 22:27.598
Private property. No trespassing.

22:33.604 --> 22:35.439
I say, this is a bit much!

22:36.231 --> 22:38.775
Perhaps your friend would like to join us.

22:38.942 --> 22:40.027
My friend?

22:40.569 --> 22:42.821
Some rather nasty weather out there.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.949
Perhaps he's lost.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.285
I don't think so.

22:50.162 --> 22:52.164
We don't get many trespassers up here.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.248
Really?

22:53.707 --> 22:54.708
Why not?

22:55.209 --> 22:56.460
We shoot them.

22:59.129 --> 23:00.130
Sugar?

23:45.342 --> 23:47.094
Is that you, Mrs. Peel?

23:54.893 --> 23:56.395
Manners, Mrs. Peel.

24:04.778 --> 24:05.779
Steed?

24:09.032 --> 24:10.033
Steed?

24:14.163 --> 24:15.414
There you are.

24:15.747 --> 24:16.748
Tea?

24:17.624 --> 24:18.792
With lemon.

24:19.168 --> 24:21.378
Grape? I bought them specially.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.634
I hope you don't mind me taking liberties.

24:27.718 --> 24:29.303
I had to tuck you up in bed.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.555
You didn't seem in good shape
when I found you.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.140
I was frozen stiff.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.351
Now I feel much revived.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.312
Not me you should thank for that.

24:38.395 --> 24:41.857
Actually, I wasn't about to.
I recall a very strange thing.

24:42.149 --> 24:44.318
You tried to shoot me, didn't you?

24:44.568 --> 24:46.278
I would never shoot you.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.656
- Not without my reasons.
- I remember it clearly.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.700
One shot to the heart.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.660
But, luckily, my...

24:54.411 --> 24:56.788
...Trubshaw waistcoat was bulletproof.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.708
Silly me, I thought you were
just overdressed.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.211
"Be prepared. " Is that your motto?

25:02.294 --> 25:05.464
I thought it best to take precautions.
One never knows.

25:05.589 --> 25:08.050
I suppose Mother warned you
about women like me.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.594
Until now, I didn't know
there were women like you.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.181
Obviously, I'm the sort
that doesn't take "no" for an answer.

25:14.264 --> 25:17.809
I think that would depend entirely
on the question, Mrs. Peel.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.856
I say, you definitely are Mrs. Peel,
aren't you?

25:22.940 --> 25:24.191
You're delirious.

25:24.316 --> 25:26.109
I should've abandoned you.

25:26.818 --> 25:29.821
Nursing an invalid isn't my idea of fun,
after all.

25:30.614 --> 25:32.449
I could've taken up any amount of offers.

25:32.533 --> 25:33.534
And?

25:33.617 --> 25:36.161
I did find a clue at Sir August's.

25:40.165 --> 25:41.583
You see, Steed...

25:42.125 --> 25:43.752
...a woman's touch...

25:45.128 --> 25:46.797
"Wonderland Weather. "

25:52.803 --> 25:53.887
Hello.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.430
Wonderland Weather?

25:55.514 --> 25:56.515
Yes.

25:56.640 --> 26:01.019
You've been recommended by a friend who
said you'd know all about our problem.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.815
We're awfully worried about our roses.

26:06.525 --> 26:08.026
I don't understand.

26:08.110 --> 26:10.153
My colleague and I represent...

26:10.279 --> 26:12.322
...a very influential group
of flower growers...

26:12.406 --> 26:15.284
...working under
tremendously adverse conditions.

26:15.659 --> 26:18.412
For some years,
we've been breeding a special rose...

26:18.495 --> 26:20.122
...the Crimson Monk...

26:20.247 --> 26:23.167
...until in the past week
we've been plagued by...

26:23.417 --> 26:24.668
...ladybirds.

26:25.002 --> 26:27.045
I thought ladybirds loved roses.

26:27.629 --> 26:30.632
A little too much, apparently.
Now our flower show's coming up.

26:30.716 --> 26:33.594
We need a few more warm summer days
very quickly.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.387
Yes.

26:36.847 --> 26:40.350
Have you seen the seven-spotted ladybird
in the mating season?

26:41.476 --> 26:43.103
Speckled grey larvae?

26:43.854 --> 26:45.105
A month to...

26:45.898 --> 26:47.524
...pupate, then...

26:48.859 --> 26:50.277
...no more roses.

26:50.402 --> 26:51.486
Voracious.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.448
I hope I haven't come to the wrong place.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.909
I was recommended
by a member of BROLLY.

26:57.701 --> 26:58.577
BROLLY?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.829
Don't say you haven't heard of it.

27:01.038 --> 27:03.582
I was speaking to my colleague,
Sir August.

27:04.249 --> 27:06.543
You do know Sir August de Wynter?

27:06.877 --> 27:07.961
Of course.

27:10.214 --> 27:14.301
Welcome to Wonderland Weather,
here in our London headquarters.

27:15.344 --> 27:18.180
Now, allied with our colleagues
from BROLLY...

27:18.847 --> 27:21.016
...together we will make history.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.567
You all know who I am...

27:31.068 --> 27:32.903
...and I know all of you...

27:32.986 --> 27:35.447
...but you cannot know one another.

27:36.114 --> 27:37.115
Security...

27:37.241 --> 27:38.909
...is still paramount.

27:40.077 --> 27:42.371
Our organization now faces...

27:42.871 --> 27:44.581
...its greatest test.

27:46.208 --> 27:47.376
Therefore...

27:47.709 --> 27:50.003
...I demand absolute loyalty...

27:50.671 --> 27:52.381
...absolute obedience.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.884
But if anybody wishes to resign...

27:56.260 --> 27:58.011
...he must do so now.

28:00.264 --> 28:02.724
And in recognition of your work...

28:02.933 --> 28:06.061
...a generous offer of $1 million awaits you.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.278
Now...

28:15.195 --> 28:16.947
...does anybody wish...

28:17.531 --> 28:18.699
...to resign?

28:21.952 --> 28:23.787
Please don't be shy.

28:31.253 --> 28:32.254
Well.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.383
Well, now.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.803
We owe so much to both of you.

28:40.095 --> 28:43.432
Without your work,
my humble project would perish.

28:45.475 --> 28:47.853
How can I show my appreciation?

28:56.236 --> 28:57.821
Any other business?

28:58.739 --> 29:01.074
- You actually sell weather here?
- Yes.

29:01.533 --> 29:04.077
Our newest line Summer or winter.

29:04.203 --> 29:08.123
Tuscany or Gstaad. Natural weather
delivered down your phone line.

29:08.499 --> 29:10.584
All you'll need is a radio transmitter.

29:10.667 --> 29:11.835
How real...

29:12.503 --> 29:13.754
...will it feel?

29:13.837 --> 29:14.796
Very.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.591
A whole new line
in personalized meteorology.

29:17.758 --> 29:21.678
Imagine... an autumn mist, dappled
sunshine through an autumn glade.

29:22.679 --> 29:23.472
Temperature-

29:23.555 --> 29:24.932
Around 65Â°?

29:27.768 --> 29:29.144
Whatever you fancy, sir.

29:29.228 --> 29:30.312
Marvelous.

29:30.437 --> 29:33.774
A solution to matters meteorological
and horticultural...

29:34.233 --> 29:36.026
...and to my roses.

29:41.198 --> 29:42.115
Excuse me.

29:42.199 --> 29:43.367
Hurry back.

30:22.197 --> 30:24.741
Babbington, head of Prospero Research.

30:25.367 --> 30:26.368
And?

30:26.577 --> 30:27.411
Morton...

30:27.494 --> 30:28.912
...his assistant.

30:49.433 --> 30:50.851
I'll take the high road.

30:50.934 --> 30:52.769
And I'll take the low road.

31:43.403 --> 31:44.655
Good morning.

31:50.202 --> 31:52.746
That was a very silly thing to do.

33:38.435 --> 33:39.520
Mrs. Peel?

33:51.865 --> 33:54.910
- Just in time to save me from myself.
- Are you all right?

33:54.993 --> 33:56.995
I thought I was seeing double.

33:57.830 --> 33:59.414
That makes two of us.

34:06.380 --> 34:08.632
So now you're saying
there are two Mrs. Peels?

34:08.715 --> 34:11.717
- Preposterous!
- Let me handle this. I'm in charge.

34:11.802 --> 34:13.178
We both know who's responsible.

34:13.262 --> 34:15.722
This story is a complete red herring.
It's quite impossible.

34:15.806 --> 34:19.935
Nothing is impossible. I often think
of six impossible things before breakfast.

34:20.018 --> 34:21.895
Thank you for your contribution.

34:21.978 --> 34:24.648
And now will you kindly allow me
to continue?

34:26.024 --> 34:27.860
Steed, you were saying?

34:28.360 --> 34:31.530
I was saying someone's recruiting
your Prospero scientists...

34:31.612 --> 34:33.614
...under a cover organization.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.243
But it's not Mrs. Peel.

34:36.784 --> 34:40.414
If you're so sure of her innocence,
do you have another suspect?

34:40.539 --> 34:41.540
I may.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.083
What makes you so sure of an attack?

34:44.168 --> 34:47.295
The World Council of Ministers is meeting
on St. Swithin's Day...

34:47.379 --> 34:48.630
...the patron saint of weather-

34:48.714 --> 34:49.715
You see?

34:49.797 --> 34:51.800
I do see. That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

34:51.884 --> 34:54.761
I saw both Mrs. Peels, with my own eyes.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.767
We can't waste any more time.
He has his orders.

35:00.851 --> 35:02.352
I'm counting on you, Steed.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.188
The clock is ticking.

35:52.694 --> 35:54.822
A perfect dress rehearsal.

36:01.245 --> 36:04.581
Mother and Father are convinced
an attack will take place.

36:05.332 --> 36:09.086
Could someone like Sir August
really target a kind of weather bomb?

36:10.629 --> 36:12.130
Queen to rook five.

36:12.256 --> 36:16.468
If they knew what they were doing.
It's all a question of protons and ions.

36:16.593 --> 36:17.761
Do explain.

36:17.928 --> 36:21.014
Left on their own, they repel each other.
Very unstable.

36:21.098 --> 36:22.683
Knight to knight four.

36:23.350 --> 36:26.812
To achieve fusion,
they require a little extra oomph.

36:27.938 --> 36:30.607
A gentle embrace, as opposed to a clinch.

36:31.191 --> 36:33.819
Low excitation energy,
technically speaking.

36:33.902 --> 36:34.987
Then, boom.

36:35.779 --> 36:36.780
Exactly.

36:37.698 --> 36:39.408
The pawn to knight four.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.661
Look, I've been charting
these weather outbreaks.

36:42.828 --> 36:44.788
Pawn to queen's knight three.

36:45.205 --> 36:47.583
- Are you paying attention?
- Absolutely.

36:47.666 --> 36:49.668
A believer in firm discipline.

36:50.002 --> 36:51.461
Do you always obey orders?

36:51.545 --> 36:52.546
Always.

36:52.963 --> 36:54.464
Except when I don't.

36:55.382 --> 36:56.967
Knight to queen five.

36:58.635 --> 37:03.098
For example, if I were, perish the thought,
under orders to kill you...

37:03.765 --> 37:06.310
- Pity you never told me.
- You never asked.

37:06.518 --> 37:10.272
I can't mention everything.
Besides, we were getting along so well.

37:10.397 --> 37:12.274
You didn't want to spoil the fun.

37:12.357 --> 37:15.027
It would've put a damper on things,
don't you agree?

37:15.110 --> 37:16.361
I'm intrigued.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.780
Pawn to queen's bishop three.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.451
What did you have in mind?
Nothing too messy, I hope.

37:22.576 --> 37:25.120
No need to dwell on the unsavory aspects.

37:25.245 --> 37:28.665
After all, according to your file,
you're a psychopathic personality...

37:28.749 --> 37:32.085
...with schizophrenic delusions,
suffering from recurring amnesia...

37:32.169 --> 37:33.879
...based on traumatic repression...

37:33.962 --> 37:37.341
...leading to outbursts
of antisocial and violent behavior.

37:38.884 --> 37:40.469
Knight to king seven.

37:40.844 --> 37:41.803
Check.

37:44.264 --> 37:46.517
Is that really what you think of me?

37:47.434 --> 37:48.435
Well...

37:48.727 --> 37:50.562
...just my type, Mrs. Peel.

37:53.273 --> 37:55.734
Good, because I think I found something.

37:57.027 --> 37:59.029
You never fail to surprise me.

37:59.321 --> 38:00.572
On this map...

38:03.200 --> 38:04.159
...here...

38:04.243 --> 38:07.246
...a cluster of microclimates
around a single area.

38:07.371 --> 38:08.872
Very, very strange.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.875
Time to pay Sir August another visit.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.213
Your move.

38:18.340 --> 38:19.842
Queen takes knight.

38:21.426 --> 38:22.511
Checkmate.

38:25.639 --> 38:27.057
It's just a game.

38:30.185 --> 38:33.146
I can't hold off The Ministry much longer.

38:33.605 --> 38:37.526
This Mrs. Peel, I'm warning you,
don't let her get too close.

38:40.529 --> 38:41.864
Good shot.

38:47.327 --> 38:50.289
Don't worry. I'll take care of Mrs. Peel.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.961
You're playing rather well today, Father.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.839
- Shall we double the bet?
- Yes.

39:00.424 --> 39:03.051
I've never been able
to refuse you anything.

39:06.847 --> 39:07.806
Pity.

39:08.265 --> 39:09.433
Just missed.

39:15.397 --> 39:16.398
I win again.

39:35.626 --> 39:39.129
I thought you lived on the edge, Mrs. Peel.
Is this as fast as you can go?

39:39.213 --> 39:41.673
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?

39:42.549 --> 39:44.134
We're being followed.

39:45.302 --> 39:46.762
What's that noise?

39:56.230 --> 39:57.231
Insects.

39:57.356 --> 39:58.815
Bigger every year.

40:04.029 --> 40:06.073
Sir August thinks of everything.

40:11.954 --> 40:12.955
Hold on.

41:24.985 --> 41:26.069
Let's go!

42:11.782 --> 42:12.866
Head down.

42:55.325 --> 42:58.203
Would you please be so kind
as to hit the ground...

42:58.287 --> 43:00.372
...if it's not too much trouble?

43:09.006 --> 43:10.632
I hope he was a baddy.

43:11.133 --> 43:13.427
My name's Alice.
Mother said you'd be on your way.

43:13.510 --> 43:15.971
- John Steed.
- And this must be Mrs. Peel.

43:16.221 --> 43:17.639
Mrs. Peel, Alice.

43:20.809 --> 43:22.060
How do you do?

43:28.650 --> 43:30.194
Cocky little bastard.

43:30.611 --> 43:31.612
Indeed.

43:31.820 --> 43:34.156
- Are you with Mother or Father?
- Both, actually.

43:34.239 --> 43:37.743
I'm glad to hear they're together at last.
They don't get along.

43:37.826 --> 43:40.204
Promotion, top job, most unfair.

43:41.038 --> 43:43.123
- Quite a fuss at The Ministry.
- You don't say.

43:43.207 --> 43:45.292
I think we should be on our way.

43:47.085 --> 43:49.630
Someone didn't want you
to get to the party.

43:49.713 --> 43:51.882
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

43:57.888 --> 43:59.932
This way. I know a back way in.

44:17.908 --> 44:18.992
Excuse me.

44:19.451 --> 44:21.703
You are a Gemini, Mrs. Peel?

44:22.579 --> 44:24.039
How did you guess?

44:33.799 --> 44:36.802
Let's take separate paths.
We'll meet in the middle.

44:36.885 --> 44:37.886
Perfect.

44:41.598 --> 44:45.185
Ah, yes, it's clear now.
A love maze in a trapezoid shape.

44:45.519 --> 44:46.770
A love maze.

44:47.062 --> 44:49.940
Originally late-17th-century design,
then copied.

45:01.535 --> 45:03.453
Over here, by your side.

45:04.204 --> 45:05.455
I was worried.

45:05.622 --> 45:09.084
- How touching. Afraid you'd lost me?
- No, that you might escape.

45:09.168 --> 45:10.502
Still suspicious?

45:10.586 --> 45:14.131
Just wondering if you'd brought me here
under false pretenses.

45:14.548 --> 45:17.301
Frankly, I'm amazed.
Perhaps I should run away.

45:17.885 --> 45:19.595
I'll have to give chase.

45:19.970 --> 45:21.054
I'll hide.

45:21.180 --> 45:22.431
How romantic.

45:22.639 --> 45:23.640
Do try.

45:39.573 --> 45:41.158
Sir August de Wynter.

45:41.241 --> 45:42.409
John Steed.

45:47.372 --> 45:50.292
An old trick I learned
from a dervish in Istanbul.

45:50.459 --> 45:51.710
Turkish rules.

45:52.503 --> 45:54.505
- If you insist.
- Then try this.

45:58.550 --> 46:00.302
A man with an umbrella...

46:00.385 --> 46:02.137
...is a man praying for rain.

46:02.221 --> 46:06.141
And a man without one is a fool.
Never trust the weather, Sir August.

46:07.351 --> 46:08.685
Rain or shine...

46:09.394 --> 46:10.646
...all is mine.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.430
So glad you could come.

46:46.056 --> 46:47.850
I thought I'd drop in.

46:49.434 --> 46:50.602
Comfortable?

46:51.478 --> 46:52.563
How cozy.

46:53.397 --> 46:54.898
Just the two of us?

46:55.023 --> 46:57.317
Yes, like spoons in a drawer.

46:59.486 --> 47:02.531
Perhaps I could help you,
if I knew what you wanted.

47:05.325 --> 47:07.035
The only thing I want...

47:07.536 --> 47:08.620
...is you.

47:09.371 --> 47:10.539
How touching.

47:10.873 --> 47:12.249
Join me, Emma...

47:12.666 --> 47:14.418
...and we have the world.

47:15.043 --> 47:17.087
You would have to say "please. "

47:17.629 --> 47:18.797
But of course.

47:19.256 --> 47:20.507
If you insist.

47:24.761 --> 47:25.762
Please.

47:28.599 --> 47:30.142
When you awaken...

47:30.642 --> 47:32.644
...you will remember nothing.

47:34.229 --> 47:35.939
Remember nothing.

47:37.232 --> 47:39.610
Steed? Steed, are you all right?

47:43.238 --> 47:45.324
I thought I was seeing double again.

47:45.407 --> 47:46.492
You were.

47:46.658 --> 47:48.327
A Gemini, definitely.

47:49.453 --> 47:51.622
No time to lose. Here's the plan.

49:16.665 --> 49:20.794
Raffle tickets? Church fete.
Could I possibly winkle a cake out of you?

49:21.044 --> 49:22.504
Or perhaps a small donation?

49:22.588 --> 49:23.839
Not today, thank you.

49:23.922 --> 49:27.301
Do come. Tombola, Lucky Dip,
Pin the Tail on the Donkey-

49:27.384 --> 49:28.886
Nor any other day!

49:28.969 --> 49:31.972
If you're going to be difficult,
I'm afraid I'll have to insist.

49:32.055 --> 49:33.515
Where's Mrs. Peel?

52:11.298 --> 52:12.382
Mrs. Peel?

52:21.391 --> 52:23.560
Don't worry, you're in my flat.

52:24.561 --> 52:25.646
Quite safe.

52:25.729 --> 52:27.314
What am I doing here?

52:27.397 --> 52:28.482
Having tea.

52:29.358 --> 52:30.526
Is that all?

52:30.692 --> 52:32.528
After a manner of speaking.

52:33.570 --> 52:34.822
Your boots...

52:35.739 --> 52:37.199
...from Trubshaw.

52:43.080 --> 52:44.665
They might be useful.

52:47.334 --> 52:48.418
Allow me.

52:52.548 --> 52:53.799
I was worried.

52:55.092 --> 52:56.677
What happened to you?

52:56.927 --> 52:59.012
I remember the maze, a house...

52:59.638 --> 53:00.889
...some music.

53:02.224 --> 53:04.268
- Then nothing.
- Try to remember.

53:05.894 --> 53:07.062
It's very important.

53:07.187 --> 53:09.398
I believe you're in extreme danger.

53:10.816 --> 53:12.776
You'd better stay here with me.

53:12.860 --> 53:13.861
Is that wise?

53:13.944 --> 53:16.697
You'll be safer here.
We can talk things through.

53:16.780 --> 53:18.157
An official debriefing.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.658
No interruptions.

53:20.033 --> 53:22.244
You live alone? No Mrs. Steed?

53:22.953 --> 53:24.663
Well, since you ask...

53:25.789 --> 53:28.125
Mrs. Steed lives in Wiltshire.

53:31.211 --> 53:32.296
My mother.

53:33.255 --> 53:35.632
I had you down as a creature of habit.

53:36.091 --> 53:37.509
A bachelor's life.

53:37.676 --> 53:39.469
It's worked quite well, until now.

53:39.553 --> 53:41.555
Don't tell me you never met the right girl.

53:41.638 --> 53:42.723
There's always the exception.

53:42.806 --> 53:43.891
That proves the rule?

53:43.974 --> 53:46.852
Quite. You're exceptional in many things.

53:47.811 --> 53:48.729
But duty...

53:48.812 --> 53:50.272
...comes first.

53:51.982 --> 53:53.609
Shall we make a start?

53:53.859 --> 53:55.944
A time and place for everything.

54:02.201 --> 54:03.160
Now...

54:04.203 --> 54:06.330
...is definitely the time.

54:12.127 --> 54:13.295
And the place.

54:17.674 --> 54:18.759
Too tight.

54:19.593 --> 54:20.594
Push.

54:30.270 --> 54:31.438
Do come in.

54:32.189 --> 54:33.273
I didn't hear you knock.

54:33.398 --> 54:37.528
We can dispense with formalities.
I want Mrs. Peel. Interrogation.

54:37.861 --> 54:39.613
Nothing I could do about it.

54:39.696 --> 54:42.366
Security restrictions, Steed, applied to you.

54:43.033 --> 54:45.035
Mrs. Peel is under arrest.

54:48.831 --> 54:49.915
In you go.

54:55.337 --> 54:56.588
Sorry, Steed.

54:56.797 --> 55:00.384
Father's taken control.
She always wanted Mother off the case.

55:03.887 --> 55:07.015
There's only one place to go,
but I'll need clearance.

55:07.474 --> 55:08.475
I'll fix it.

55:52.561 --> 55:53.520
Hello?

55:53.604 --> 55:54.605
Hello.

55:55.564 --> 55:57.816
Brenda told me to expect you, Steed.

55:59.735 --> 56:00.694
Hello?

56:01.570 --> 56:02.654
Talk to the pipe.

56:02.738 --> 56:04.239
That usually helps.

56:05.240 --> 56:06.492
Colonel Jones?

56:07.075 --> 56:09.411
Don't worry about me being invisible.

56:09.912 --> 56:12.289
Other than that, I'm perfectly normal.

56:12.831 --> 56:13.832
I see.

56:14.082 --> 56:15.584
Or rather, you don't.

56:15.667 --> 56:20.088
Learnt the trick in camouflage, till
the accident made rather a mess of things.

56:20.422 --> 56:21.965
Now I'm stuck away in the basement.

56:22.049 --> 56:23.634
Lucky if I even get the tea trolley.

56:23.717 --> 56:25.969
I'm afraid I don't have much time.

56:26.053 --> 56:28.514
I'd like you to take a look at this map.

56:32.809 --> 56:34.895
I want to know something more about...

56:34.978 --> 56:36.730
...the Prospero Program.

56:38.565 --> 56:40.150
Where'd you find this?

56:40.234 --> 56:41.735
Wonderland Weather.

56:43.028 --> 56:44.822
Retail meteorology.

56:50.285 --> 56:52.830
I believe you've jogged my memory, Steed.

56:53.539 --> 56:56.083
I may have to dig a little deeper, though.

56:58.210 --> 56:59.211
Shall I?

56:59.503 --> 57:00.587
Follow me.

57:04.007 --> 57:06.760
Hello, Mrs. Peel.
Welcome back to The Ministry.

57:06.885 --> 57:08.428
Now, we're going to have a talk.

57:08.512 --> 57:10.597
About the weather? How topical.

57:10.889 --> 57:12.266
It'll help pass the time.

57:12.349 --> 57:14.726
Time would pass anyway,
if you think about it logically.

57:14.852 --> 57:17.020
But so few do think logically
or even anti-logically.

57:17.104 --> 57:20.065
Clockwise or anti-clockwise. Tick-tock,
tock-tick. Seesaw, Margery Daw.

57:20.149 --> 57:24.653
It amounts to the same thing. After all,
how do you know I'm the real Mrs. Peel?

57:24.736 --> 57:27.114
How real do you feel, Mrs. Peel?

57:27.614 --> 57:28.782
I'll repeat the question...

57:28.866 --> 57:32.536
...bypassing the weather, which,
being British, we'll return to in a moment.

57:32.619 --> 57:35.080
Do I walk like Mrs. Peel?
Talk like Mrs. Peel?

57:35.205 --> 57:37.457
Am I witty, wise, wonderful to know?

57:37.833 --> 57:39.960
Or do I go around shooting
Ministry agents...

57:40.043 --> 57:42.129
...attempting to rule the world
on my days off?

57:42.212 --> 57:44.256
Now you're just playing games.

57:53.390 --> 57:55.851
Of course! The Ministry cloning program.

57:56.268 --> 57:59.188
Sir August ran it,
but it appears he went too far.

57:59.480 --> 58:01.940
Some of his more advanced experiments...

58:02.524 --> 58:03.859
...are not too pleasant.

58:03.942 --> 58:05.736
So they pulled him off it.

58:06.778 --> 58:08.113
Anything else?

58:09.573 --> 58:12.201
As I recall, there was some
former Ministry land used...

58:12.284 --> 58:17.080
...as a secret military installation
and sold by us to Sir August years ago.

58:18.332 --> 58:20.417
And authorized by Father.

58:21.668 --> 58:23.545
Eeny-meeny-miny-mole.

58:26.089 --> 58:27.758
And this is the site.

58:29.593 --> 58:30.969
But where is it?

58:31.136 --> 58:35.224
According to your map, it's an island
right here in the middle of London.

58:37.726 --> 58:40.437
It must be where he's controlling
the weather.

58:44.441 --> 58:46.068
Why did you never tell anyone?

58:46.151 --> 58:47.778
Nobody ever asked.

58:51.281 --> 58:54.701
These changes in weather are controlled
and aggressive.

58:55.202 --> 58:58.247
Yes, Prime Minister.
We're monitoring the situation.

58:58.622 --> 59:01.667
The Council of Ministers is now
in emergency session.

59:04.169 --> 59:06.713
The weather is getting worse
by the minute.

59:17.599 --> 59:18.600
Now...

59:19.101 --> 59:21.353
...is the winter of your discontent.

59:22.938 --> 59:24.106
Above you...

59:24.690 --> 59:26.525
...the weather is changing.

59:27.401 --> 59:29.319
The temperature is dropping.

59:30.362 --> 59:32.114
Soon it will be freezing.

59:34.199 --> 59:35.200
Why?

59:36.493 --> 59:39.997
Because the weather is no longer
in God's hands, but in mine.

59:44.501 --> 59:45.752
Those clouds...

59:45.836 --> 59:47.671
...all controlled by me...

59:47.921 --> 59:49.923
...are recreating the weather.

59:51.008 --> 59:52.593
I have set off...

59:53.177 --> 59:54.803
...a chain reaction...

59:55.971 --> 59:59.558
...that will paralyze
and ultimately destroy the city.

01:00:03.312 --> 01:00:04.688
The countdown...

01:00:05.314 --> 01:00:06.899
...has already begun.

01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:11.904
And this is merely the beginning!

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.490
This is outrageous! It's blackmail!

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:15.991
Do shut up!

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.038
Hundreds of millions will die.
They'll drown...

01:00:21.788 --> 01:00:22.873
...burn...

01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:24.208
...freeze.

01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:27.252
You...

01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:29.588
...and your governments...

01:00:29.796 --> 01:00:31.215
...have no choice.

01:00:33.759 --> 01:00:36.011
You will buy your weather from me...

01:00:37.888 --> 01:00:40.349
...and, by God, you'll pay for it.

01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:42.392
Unacceptable!

01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:48.315
Any attempt at interference will
only lead to automatic annihilation.

01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:52.861
And, by the way...

01:00:53.695 --> 01:00:55.656
...you have until midnight...

01:00:57.908 --> 01:00:59.076
...tonight!

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:09.461
Alice, are you all right?

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.047
Sir August's demands.

01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:15.384
He wants them delivered
directly to the Prime Minister.

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:21.181
"Ten percent of our gross national product
annually. " That's preposterous.

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:22.599
There will be no negotiation.

01:01:22.683 --> 01:01:24.226
His words exactly.

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:28.480
He says unless we accept his demands,
the weather will get colder and colder...

01:01:28.564 --> 01:01:31.692
...until we'll all have to go to hell
just to warm up.

01:01:32.651 --> 01:01:34.945
Did Sir August torture you, Alice?

01:01:36.363 --> 01:01:38.198
No, he didn't have to.

01:01:38.532 --> 01:01:40.033
Knows everything already.

01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:42.077
Breach of security, top level.

01:01:44.204 --> 01:01:45.289
Father.

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:49.585
Alert security.

01:01:54.006 --> 01:01:55.257
Sorry, Father.

01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:56.884
The game's up.

01:01:56.967 --> 01:01:59.887
Careful, it might go off.
We don't want another accident.

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:01.722
Half-working, as you are.

01:02:02.306 --> 01:02:05.267
Poor Mother, finally figured it out.
But too late.

01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:07.436
Nonsense. Mother knows best.

01:02:07.895 --> 01:02:09.938
I want you to release Mrs. Peel.

01:02:10.272 --> 01:02:11.356
Certainly.

01:02:11.482 --> 01:02:12.733
But which one?

01:02:24.495 --> 01:02:26.788
It really isn't Mother's day.

01:02:58.028 --> 01:02:59.488
On course to base.

01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:02.407
Seven degrees east, north by northwest.

01:03:04.368 --> 01:03:05.869
Navigation control.

01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:08.205
Anti-cyclone. Pull the right.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.582
I have Mrs. Peel on board...

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.459
...and heading back to base.

01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:15.003
We'll keep you informed of our progress.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.797
Message end.

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:49.246
The balloon, Steed. The balloon.

01:03:49.329 --> 01:03:50.747
Don't mind me.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.356
You're drifting.

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:28.952
You're drifting off course.
You're losing altitude.

01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:39.463
You've drifted off course!

01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:38.040
Prince Charming, I presume?

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:39.791
Hardly, I'm afraid.

01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:44.546
A micro-tag concealed in your boots.

01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:47.049
Thank you...

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:48.425
Trubshaw.

01:06:50.636 --> 01:06:52.095
Are you all right?

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.601
And the other Mrs. Peel?

01:06:58.393 --> 01:06:59.937
Dispatched, I think.

01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:02.397
Sad, in a way.

01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:04.608
Here, let me help you.

01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:23.710
I wonder...

01:07:57.327 --> 01:07:59.413
Unless I'm very much mistaken...

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:02.291
...that was a kiss, Steed.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:05.419
Yes.

01:08:06.753 --> 01:08:07.921
Technically.

01:08:08.672 --> 01:08:09.840
"Technically?"

01:08:10.007 --> 01:08:13.468
Well, I would never presume.
It was more in the spirit of...

01:08:13.886 --> 01:08:15.512
...scientific inquiry.

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:19.057
Hard evidence, you might say.

01:08:19.892 --> 01:08:21.602
I realized that immediately.

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:23.145
Of course you did.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.522
I needed proof that you were...

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:28.859
...definitely Mrs. Peel.

01:08:29.776 --> 01:08:30.777
I see.

01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:33.154
And...

01:08:34.615 --> 01:08:35.866
...convinced?

01:08:37.201 --> 01:08:38.368
Well, I'm...

01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:40.787
...still thinking.

01:08:41.747 --> 01:08:44.374
Dense cloud formations
moving northeast, sir.

01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:47.920
Some sort of radio transmitter.

01:08:49.712 --> 01:08:52.174
Of course we have it under control, sir.

01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:56.386
Not quite under control, but-

01:08:58.721 --> 01:08:59.807
Yes, sir.

01:09:00.474 --> 01:09:01.934
I understand, sir.

01:09:02.643 --> 01:09:05.187
Our agents are on the case right now, sir.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.357
Two of them, sir.

01:09:10.067 --> 01:09:11.068
A man...

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:13.362
...and a woman, sir.

01:09:36.468 --> 01:09:37.636
According to Colonel Jones...

01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:41.807
...this is the site of a Ministry installation
sold off years ago to-

01:09:41.974 --> 01:09:44.100
- Wonderland Weather, I bet.
- Quite.

01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:14.506
Something up ahead.

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.433
Alas, poor Teddy...

01:10:25.142 --> 01:10:26.602
I knew him, Steed.

01:10:27.102 --> 01:10:28.187
Penrose...

01:10:29.104 --> 01:10:31.190
...head of Antimatter Fission...

01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:32.608
...at Prospero.

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:35.903
The teddy bears are having a picnic.

01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:37.613
We're getting warm.

01:10:46.413 --> 01:10:47.831
Seems familiar.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.882
Mrs. Peel, you're needed.

01:11:01.595 --> 01:11:02.679
Excuse me.

01:11:03.347 --> 01:11:05.349
Equipment needs adjusting.

01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:07.559
Nothing broken, I hope.

01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:08.977
My umbrella.

01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:11.855
Tight fit in here.

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:13.732
Allow me.

01:11:15.192 --> 01:11:16.985
How now, brown cow?

01:11:17.528 --> 01:11:18.695
Welcome.

01:12:00.654 --> 01:12:02.489
There must be a hatch somewhere.

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:05.909
I need to locate the circuits,
break the codes and disconnect the wires.

01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:07.411
How will you know if it works?

01:12:07.494 --> 01:12:09.371
I won't, until I make the right connection.

01:12:09.454 --> 01:12:11.039
So much for science.

01:12:12.416 --> 01:12:14.126
I'll stick to swordplay.

01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:21.341
This must be it.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.139
Don't wait for me.

01:12:27.222 --> 01:12:28.724
Perish the thought.

01:12:29.224 --> 01:12:30.476
Just one thing.

01:12:30.642 --> 01:12:31.727
Good luck?

01:12:31.977 --> 01:12:35.063
Something like that.
Not that you need it, of course.

01:13:03.884 --> 01:13:04.885
Bailey...

01:13:05.302 --> 01:13:06.553
...take her.

01:13:07.805 --> 01:13:09.431
I'll attend to Steed.

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:30.030
Oh, fuck!

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:46.296
Weather system...

01:15:46.421 --> 01:15:48.465
...level one and rising.

01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:54.471
Weather system...

01:15:54.555 --> 01:15:55.806
...level two...

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.391
...and rising.

01:15:58.475 --> 01:16:00.269
Storm system activated.

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:20.873
Weather system, level six...

01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:22.666
...and rising.

01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:38.182
John Steed. What a horses arse
of a name.

01:16:39.183 --> 01:16:41.852
Clearly, you're not a racing man,
Sir August.

01:16:42.186 --> 01:16:45.731
Anyway, I have no time for pleasantries.
We have a score to settle.

01:16:45.814 --> 01:16:48.358
Are you sure you're up for this, dear boy?

01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:51.528
Absolutely, old chap.

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:01.246
You'll pay for that.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.381
Target locked.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.721
Warning.

01:17:18.055 --> 01:17:19.973
Weather silo activated.

01:17:38.242 --> 01:17:39.743
Not bad for an amateur.

01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:41.411
I'm not one to boast.

01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:43.872
Modest. And much to be modest about.

01:18:00.597 --> 01:18:02.391
Unauthorized entry.

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:47.644
Time to die.

01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:49.980
Not just yet.

01:20:18.235 --> 01:20:19.486
Was it red...

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.321
...or was it black?

01:20:25.033 --> 01:20:26.285
Here it goes.

01:20:26.952 --> 01:20:28.745
Eeny-meeny-miny...

01:20:36.003 --> 01:20:37.087
Shutdown.

01:20:38.172 --> 01:20:39.256
Shutdown.

01:21:07.618 --> 01:21:08.619
Here...

01:21:09.203 --> 01:21:10.370
...Mrs. Peel.

01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:12.456
What kept you?

01:21:13.415 --> 01:21:14.583
The weather.

01:21:18.587 --> 01:21:19.922
Auto destruct...

01:21:20.464 --> 01:21:22.382
...three, two, one...

01:21:27.304 --> 01:21:28.388
You must be joking.

01:21:28.514 --> 01:21:31.141
And I thought you had it all under control.

01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:33.101
Here. Into the pod.

01:21:33.185 --> 01:21:34.978
There must be a way out.

01:21:37.773 --> 01:21:39.024
Seal the hatch.

01:21:57.835 --> 01:22:01.129
Yes, sir. Confirm reports
the storm is dropping.

01:22:02.714 --> 01:22:05.467
A spot of internal trouble.
I took a firm grip.

01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:07.636
One or two casualties.

01:22:08.178 --> 01:22:10.097
No word yet from our people.

01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:12.766
Thank you, sir.

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:16.478
Pity about Steed and Mrs. Peel.

01:22:17.396 --> 01:22:18.814
Missing in action?

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:22.860
Better send out a search party.
You never can tell.

01:22:56.727 --> 01:22:59.188
"The owl and the pussycat went to sea. "

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.648
"In a beautiful pea-green boat. "

01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:03.650
A perfect morning.

01:23:03.734 --> 01:23:04.818
Bit chilly.

01:23:05.152 --> 01:23:07.321
I think we deserve some champagne.

01:23:16.747 --> 01:23:17.831
A toast...

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.666
...to a job well done.

01:23:19.833 --> 01:23:21.335
To a narrow escape.

01:23:23.086 --> 01:23:24.171
Macaroon?

01:23:26.256 --> 01:23:27.674
Thank you, Steed.

01:23:27.925 --> 01:23:28.926
No, no.

01:23:29.384 --> 01:23:31.094
Thank you, Mrs. Peel.
