It's going out the back!
It went out the back!

00:49.983 --> 00:52.017
[Willy] It went right over
the hill. Did you see it?

- Holy [bleep]!
- [Bill] What was that?

00:53.988 --> 00:55.154

right up there to them guys,</i>

there's gonna be
a rumble out here,

02:15.803 --> 02:17.603
in the middle of the woods.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.404
[Buck] I mean, do you have
a problem or something?

02:19.406 --> 02:21.974
[Huck] Oh, this is gonna go
downhill real quick from now.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.709
[Buck] Okay, take that
strobe light out of my eyes.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.877
[man] No.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.078
[Buck] I'm not out here
trying to fight you guys,

02:26.080 --> 02:28.514
I'm trying to see
if you need help.

[Buck] Yeah, come on.

02:53.007 --> 02:56.008
[bleep] damn it!
I said, "Stay [bleep] here!"

02:56.010 --> 02:57.976
[men grunting]

02:57.978 --> 03:00.212

03:00.214 --> 03:02.814
What the [bleep]?

[Buck] Get you some of that!

03:04.185 --> 03:05.551
[Buck grunting]

03:05.553 --> 03:06.785

03:06.787 --> 03:08.754
Settle down.
Hold on. Stay down there.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.923
Hold on! Stay down!

03:10.925 --> 03:14.626
- Stay down! Settle down.
- [Buck] Stop. Are we done?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.728
- Are we done?
- [Huck] Settle down.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.863
- [Buck] You guys had enough?
- [Huck] Come on.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.798
Don't fight no more.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.433
- [man] All right.
- [Huck] Stay down.

03:21.801 --> 03:23.669
[Buck] Are we done?

03:23.671 --> 03:25.704
- [man] Yes.
- [Huck] I'm gonna let you go, all right?

03:25.706 --> 03:26.605
[Buck] I'm gonna
let you guys up.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.839
If you guys go scrapping' again,

03:27.841 --> 03:29.575
I swear I'm not gonna be
near as nice this time.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.943
- [Huck] Be cool.
- You understand?

03:30.945 --> 03:32.077
- [Huck] Be cool, man.
- [man] Yes, sir.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.079
[Buck]
All right, come on.

03:34.180 --> 03:35.414
Come on, hop up.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.082
Hop up.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.684
<i>[Huck] I don't know
what the hell happened.</i>

03:38.686 --> 03:40.786
<i>All hell broke loose.</i>

03:40.788 --> 03:42.688
There's knees going everywhere,

03:42.690 --> 03:43.689
people's feet in your face,

03:43.756 --> 03:45.724
<i>toes in your mouth.</i>

03:45.726 --> 03:49.061
<i>I ain't seen that many
body parts all over the place</i>

03:49.063 --> 03:51.163
since I was at an orgy
in the '70s.

03:51.165 --> 03:54.166
[Buck] All right,
let's talk civil now.

03:54.834 --> 03:55.901
You lost your dog.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.636
Is that what you all's...

03:57.638 --> 03:58.870
We thought... We thought
someone was hurt.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.572
That's the reason
we've come down here.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.974
We hear someone yell for Randy,

04:01.976 --> 04:03.375
and we think someone's hurt,
we hear gunshots.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.844
Okay?

04:05.846 --> 04:07.879
So, can we just calm down
a minute and talk about this?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.848
[man speaking]

04:09.850 --> 04:10.649
- No.
- I'm not gonna call the landowner,

04:10.651 --> 04:11.850
I'm not gonna call the law.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.052
We can discuss this like men.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.787
- All right?
- [man] All right.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.023
[Buck] Okay.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.324
How long ago
did you lose your dog?

04:19.792 --> 04:21.226
[man speaking]

04:26.232 --> 04:28.667
- [Buck] Okay.
- [Huck] So you've been out here all night,

04:28.669 --> 04:30.302
- part of the day, yeah?
- [men] Yeah.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.469
And you start...
Start firing...

04:31.471 --> 04:33.839
- Firing off the rounds, hoping he'd come.
- [man] Yeah.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.707
Randy's been...
Randy's been trained.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.142
He's a five-year-old dog.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.144
Sometimes he'd be back
in three shots.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.512
[Buck] Okay.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.913
You guys understand
that there's...

04:41.915 --> 04:43.815
There's things in
these woods that are...

04:43.817 --> 04:45.217
That are dangerous.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.853
[man speaking]

04:47.855 --> 04:50.789
- It's not a couple of coyotes, bud.
- Yeah.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.158
[Buck] There's something
out here that is killing dogs,

04:53.993 --> 04:55.694
and we have found
some collars off of 'em.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.796
Check that out.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.997
-[Willy] Look at the size of that.
-[Buck] Look at that!

04:58.999 --> 05:00.198
[Bill] Dang.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.400
Dog collar.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.901
No way.

05:02.903 --> 05:03.935
[Bill] It's a dog collar.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.437
[Buck] We haven't
found any recently.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.206
We haven't found any
with a tag named "Randy."

05:08.208 --> 05:11.410
If we can find your dog, we
will gladly get a hold of you.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.544
Okay?

05:12.546 --> 05:13.979
[man] Name's on the card.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.181
[stammering]
The third number on the card?

05:16.616 --> 05:17.883
- Okay.
- [Huck] Cool.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.385
- Yeah.
- All right. If we come across this dog,

05:20.387 --> 05:21.753
I will call you guys,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.188
and I will make sure
you get your dog back.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.856
- Okay?
- [man] All right.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.124
All right.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.060
[Huck]
Good tussle, bud.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.761
[Buck] Were you originally out here
looking for Goldschmidt Hill maybe?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.064
- I knew one thing, I...
- [man speaking]

05:33.433 --> 05:35.067
Land of the Fallen Trees?

05:35.868 --> 05:38.470
- [man] Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.172
Boys. I'm too old
to be fighting, guys.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.841
Guys, take care of yourself.
Be careful out here.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.844
<i>[Buck] Out of all the things I
thought I might encounter tonight,</i>

05:45.846 --> 05:48.413
Grafton Monster,
Smoke Wolves, wolves,

05:48.415 --> 05:51.850
a Bigfoot, a bear,

05:51.852 --> 05:54.720
I didn't think I was gonna end
up in a scrap with three kids.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.188
This sucks.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.923
- It was a pretty good scuffle.
- [Huck] Yeah.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.891
I had a [bleep] tiger
by the tail,

05:59.893 --> 06:00.892
and I couldn't let go.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.228
[laughing]

06:05.932 --> 06:07.999
I was wondering there
for a minute.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.301
Those boys were tough.

06:09.303 --> 06:12.037
Oh, I'm telling you, son.
I'm telling you.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.140
What do you say we get Willy
and Bill, meet up with them?

06:15.408 --> 06:16.274
[Buck exhales deeply]

06:16.876 --> 06:18.710
Thank you.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.912
- Willy.
- [Willy] Yeah, go ahead, Buck.

06:20.914 --> 06:21.980
We're heading in your direction.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.383
Why don't you,
uh, start walking this way?

06:24.385 --> 06:25.784
<i>We'll meet you halfway.</i>

06:25.786 --> 06:26.718
<i>We'll fill you in
on what's going on.</i>

06:26.786 --> 06:27.986
All right.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.921
- Let's go meet up with Willy and Jeff.
- [Huck] All right.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.191
[Buck] Oh, man.
I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.760
- [Jeff] Lead the way.
- We can talk with him.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.162
Me and Jeff, we are gonna
go meet up with Huck and Buck.

06:37.164 --> 06:37.996
Oh, there they are.

06:37.998 --> 06:38.797
- [Huck] Hey.
- [Buck] There they are.

06:38.864 --> 06:40.132
[Willy]
<i>But something's telling me</i>

06:40.134 --> 06:43.802
the Grafton Monster knows we've
been right out here in this blind.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.805
It sounded like all kinds of
commotion going on over there.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.739
- [Jeff] Yeah.
- Yeah, we found 'em.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.940
[Huck] Yeah.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.109
And then we got
in a little bit of a scuffle.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.677
- Scuffle?
- [Buck] Yeah.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.413
- Just a tad bit.
- Yeah.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.115
We looked like a pile of
worms there at one point.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.017
[all laughing]

06:59.084 --> 06:59.951
[Huck] Man.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.853
At one point, I had a foot,

07:01.855 --> 07:02.854
and I was trying to figure out.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.256
I thought,
"That's not Huck's boot."

07:04.258 --> 07:06.091
I thought,
"That's not Huck's boot."

07:06.158 --> 07:07.125
[laughing]

07:07.127 --> 07:08.860
- Was it yours?
- Yes!

07:08.862 --> 07:10.228
[all laughing]

07:13.032 --> 07:14.733
- [Buck] Oh, man.
- [Willy] Oh, no.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.768
It ended up turning out okay.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.403
Got everything chilled out.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.105
Randy's not a person.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.540
- [Huck] Yeah.
- Randy's a dog.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.908
Oh.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.609
That boy was really
upset about that dog.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.244
Yes, he was.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.847
But there was something,
something strange.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.282
- What's that?
- What's that?

07:30.817 --> 07:32.417
I went to shake their hand.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.352
You know, fair fight,
shake your hand.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.888
And I asked that boy, I said,

07:36.890 --> 07:39.624
"Were you originally out here
looking for Goldschmidt Hill?"

07:39.626 --> 07:40.892
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.995
He said, "No.
Land of the Fallen Trees."

07:45.031 --> 07:46.364
[man speaking]

07:47.700 --> 07:48.934
- Huh.
- [Willy] Damn.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.036
- [Buck] So--
- I wonder what that means,

07:51.038 --> 07:51.736
"Land of Fallen Trees."

07:51.738 --> 07:55.106
I, I don't know.
I don't know.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.843
<i>That boy said something about
the Land of the Fallen Trees.</i>

07:57.845 --> 07:59.311
Land of the Fallen Trees?

07:59.912 --> 08:01.413
[man] Yeah.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.148
What the hell even is that?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.750
What's
"Land of the Fallen Trees"?

08:05.752 --> 08:07.152
Guys, I know we came out here

08:07.154 --> 08:08.219
to try to find Goldschmidt Hill,

08:08.221 --> 08:11.523
- but it's been a heck of a night.
- Oh, buddy.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.924
I'm wore out.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.392
- Let's get out of here.
- [Huck] Hell yeah.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.660
All right.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.929
Tomorrow, we need
to get out here early

08:17.931 --> 08:18.997
and find Goldschmidt Hill.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.298
[Buck] Whoo.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.834
<i>[Huck] Right now, we need
to get the hell out of here.</i>

08:22.836 --> 08:24.503
I'm wore plumb the hell out.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.904
[Buck]
Me and Huck's ready

08:25.906 --> 08:27.939
to get out of here
and go take a hot bath.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.174
Not together.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.942
- [Huck] Oh, thank God.
- [Jeff] I hope not.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.044
[all laughing]

08:38.084 --> 08:41.686
Guys, today is
a very special day.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.954
[all agreeing]

08:42.956 --> 08:44.656
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.624
Big Brass's birthday.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.360
- Yeah.
- That's right, Bill.

08:48.362 --> 08:52.163
<i>[Huck] It's been a little over a
year since Trapper passed on,</i>

08:52.165 --> 08:54.733
<i>but we still miss
this man dearly,</i>

08:54.735 --> 08:56.902
and I'm proud
to call him my friend.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.403
[Buck] I thought
it would be nice

08:58.405 --> 09:00.739
to pay Trapper
a little homage today.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.407
- [Huck] Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.976
All right, bring on
the dancing girls.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.678
- [all laughing]
- Yeah!

09:06.680 --> 09:08.847
Whoo-hoo!

09:08.849 --> 09:10.682
- I can't bring out everything Trapper likes.
- Yeah.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.017
No.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.852
You'd have to shut
the cameras completely off.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.287
[all laughing]

09:19.425 --> 09:20.759
But we have a few things

09:20.761 --> 09:22.827
that I'd like to show you guys.

09:22.829 --> 09:23.895
- All right.
- [Buck] All right?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.064
- Yes, sir.
- Hell yeah!

09:26.066 --> 09:28.833
- [Bill] Yes, sir.
- [Buck] First up,

09:28.835 --> 09:30.635
- his hat.
- Oh, yeah.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.704
Oh, yeah. Hell yeah.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.773
This isn't the hat
that Trapper always wore,

09:34.775 --> 09:36.741
- that everyone has seen him with.
- No.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.176
Trapper brought this one

09:38.178 --> 09:41.646
whenever his old hat
got a hole right in the front.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.647
[all laughing]

09:42.649 --> 09:44.983
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.519
It gets better. Do you
remember the night it happened?

09:47.521 --> 09:48.954
Yeah, I do.

09:48.956 --> 09:53.892
He's got that hat on,
and it was pouring rain.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.394
He just starts getting water
coming down his nose.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.064
- [all laughing] - And he
grabbed his hat, and he goes,

09:59.066 --> 09:59.898
"I'm leaking."

09:59.900 --> 10:02.367
[all laughing]

10:05.004 --> 10:06.871
He got this one
and started to break it in...

10:06.873 --> 10:07.806
[Jeff] Yeah.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.673
right before
he got sick.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.642
- Yeah.
- Right before he...

10:10.644 --> 10:12.410
Right before he didn't get to
come out with it much anymore.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.945
- Let me see this.
- Yeah, sure.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.046
And I think-- Oh, yeah.

10:15.048 --> 10:15.814
Hell yeah.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.248
But I'll tell you one thing,

10:17.250 --> 10:18.817
I'll never be able
to fill these boots.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.818
Hell no.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.819
You can't fill that hat.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.653
Oh, what the hell do you mean?

10:21.655 --> 10:22.954
I thought it looked good on me.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.723
- Give that back.
- No, your head's too big for it.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.157
[all laughing]

10:29.662 --> 10:31.262
- [Bill] Yeah.
- All right. So, next,

10:31.797 --> 10:34.132
one of my favorite pictures.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.068
- This one.
- [all exclaiming]

10:37.070 --> 10:39.804
<i>[Bill] Hell yeah.
Remember that well.</i>

10:39.806 --> 10:40.805
You guys remember this day?

10:40.807 --> 10:41.940
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Yeah.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.808
What's in his hand?
That looks...

10:43.810 --> 10:45.744
That looks like
a clear jar, don't it?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.145
- [Jeff] Yeah.
- [Willy] Oh, we'd call that

10:47.147 --> 10:49.648
- hillbilly's spring water.
- Yeah.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.383
Liquid painkiller.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.985
[Buck] This is the day
that Trapper

10:53.987 --> 10:56.821
got about half lit
and pulled his tooth.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.189
[all laughing]

10:58.691 --> 11:01.059
Ooh, ooh!

11:03.162 --> 11:06.331
- Oh. Oh, God.
- [Jeff] Yeah, come on.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.166
[all exclaiming]

11:08.534 --> 11:09.601
[Bill] Whoo!

11:09.969 --> 11:12.070
I knew you can do it, buddy.
I knew you can do it.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.772
Oh, my gosh.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.074
And then, another picture

11:16.876 --> 11:18.743
just to make everybody smile.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.445
Ready, ready? Ready?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.247
- [grunts]
- [all laughing]

11:24.016 --> 11:26.651
[Bill] <i>Looking at these
pictures of Big Brass,</i>

11:26.653 --> 11:28.787
man, they bring back
some damn good memories.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.655
- Here he is.
- [Bill] Hell yeah.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.757
- [Buck] Handsome fella.
- Oh, hell yeah.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.492
- [Buck] Handsome fella.
- He always told us he was.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.227
[all laughing]

11:36.696 --> 11:38.930
<i>[Bill] By God,
I'll tell you one thing,</i>

11:38.932 --> 11:41.800
<i>and I can probably speak for
every member on this AIMS team,</i>

11:41.802 --> 11:44.569
he will always be
our team leader.

11:44.571 --> 11:49.207
We all know Trapper liked
his white lightning, alcohol.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.776
- [laughing] Oh, yeah.
- Panther piss.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.244
[all laughing]

11:54.580 --> 11:56.114
Yeah, there's many names for it,

11:56.116 --> 11:57.782
and Trapper liked
every one of them.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.916
[all laughing]

12:00.886 --> 12:02.387
- [Buck] Yeah, he did.
- [Huck] As a matter of fact,

12:02.389 --> 12:06.825
he helped me come up with
the recipe for Sasquatch Piss.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.893
Ooh!

12:08.895 --> 12:11.896
Old Sasquatch Piss.
Oh, buddy.

12:11.898 --> 12:15.400
So, in honor
of Trapper's birthday,

12:15.402 --> 12:17.769
I got a little
special surprise for us.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.704
Oh. Oh.

12:19.706 --> 12:23.141
I present to you Sasquatch Piss.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.443
- [Buck] Oh, yeah.
- [Bill] Holy [bleep].

12:25.445 --> 12:27.078
[Buck] Whoo!

12:27.080 --> 12:30.014
Guaranteed to remove varnish
and straighten your hair.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.416
[all laughing]

12:31.418 --> 12:33.118
[Buck] Yeah.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.454
This Sasquatch Piss, it's
an all-purpose alcohol, buddy.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.555
Ooh.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.791
<i>One time, I couldn't get
my push motor running,</i>

12:39.793 --> 12:42.861
<i>put some of that into there,
and she fired up, took off.</i>

12:42.863 --> 12:44.963
<i>I could hardly keep up with it.</i>

12:44.965 --> 12:46.831
My lawn ain't looked
the same since.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.400
We always pour one

12:49.402 --> 12:50.769
for the person that ain't here.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.071
- We gotta have that.
- [Buck] Yeah.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.339
[Huck]
Here we go, boys.

12:54.907 --> 12:55.807
- Ah.
- Trapper!

12:55.809 --> 12:57.208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.411
Big Brass, this is
in your honor, brother.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.013
Hoorah!

13:02.015 --> 13:03.314
[exhales deeply]

13:06.352 --> 13:06.951
[coughs]

13:06.953 --> 13:09.187
[all laughing]

13:09.189 --> 13:11.122
- [coughing]
- [Willy] Yeah!

13:11.891 --> 13:13.424
Yeah!

13:13.426 --> 13:14.592
Whoo!

13:14.594 --> 13:15.793
Yeah, Bill!

13:15.795 --> 13:18.730
As soon as that damn Sasquatch
Piss touched my tongue,

13:18.732 --> 13:21.299
it was like getting hit with
a damn live lightning bolt.

13:24.036 --> 13:25.270
- [all laughing]
- Get you some of that.

13:25.905 --> 13:26.905
Wow!

13:26.907 --> 13:28.006
[grunting]

13:28.008 --> 13:29.474
Here's to you, Trapper.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.209
<i>That Sasquatch Piss</i>

13:31.211 --> 13:34.045
tasted like a mixture
between polyurethane...

13:35.080 --> 13:36.781
[all laughing]

13:36.783 --> 13:38.283
and moose testicles.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.220
<i>[Huck] I think
Trapper would be touched</i>

13:42.222 --> 13:44.889
that we're drinking
his whiskey in his honor.

13:44.891 --> 13:45.990
[coughs]

13:45.992 --> 13:49.894
- Oh.
- [all laughing]

13:49.896 --> 13:51.262
[grunting]

13:52.698 --> 13:53.998
[Huck]
<i>But let's just face it,</i>

13:54.000 --> 13:55.800
<i>the way
we're handling our liquor...</i>

13:55.802 --> 13:58.036
- Whoo-hoo!
- [all laughing]

13:59.405 --> 14:00.972
<i>he'd be ashamed.</i>

14:00.974 --> 14:02.907
[laughing]

14:02.909 --> 14:04.142
Whoo!

14:04.144 --> 14:05.376
- Wow!
- [Jeff] Damn.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.012
Oh. Them boys moved.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.981
- [all laughing]
- [Bill] Oh, yeah!

14:09.983 --> 14:11.950
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

14:11.952 --> 14:12.617
It finally dropped.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.386
[all laughing]

14:18.157 --> 14:20.158
- You're driving us out.
- [all laughing]

14:21.026 --> 14:22.126
Yeah.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.761
I can fly back.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.163
[all laughing]

14:26.699 --> 14:30.969
<i>[Bill] Trapper, if you're watching
down right now, Big Brass,</i>

14:30.971 --> 14:34.606
<i>hey, you see this fine team
that you put together?</i>

14:34.608 --> 14:35.974
<i>It worked, brother.</i>

14:35.976 --> 14:38.076
We're celebrating your birthday.

14:38.078 --> 14:38.943
Hell yeah!

14:38.945 --> 14:41.813
Oh, Trapper.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.147
We love you
and miss you, our friend.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.716
Happy birthday.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.151
[all cheering]

14:50.789 --> 14:52.257
[Buck] Guys, be careful.
She's a little soupy in here.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.727
[Bill] Yeah, she big-time
soupy in here, boys. Wow.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.630
<i>[Buck] Today, we're heading
out to try to find Goldschmidt Hill.</i>

14:58.632 --> 15:00.498
He said,
"Walk right up this creek."

15:00.500 --> 15:02.400
- [Jeff] That's what he said.
- [Huck] Oh, yeah.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.737
We knew Goldschmidt Hill is
supposed to have a sign at the base of it,

15:05.739 --> 15:07.672
<i>so, today, we're starting
at the bottom of the hollow,</i>

15:07.674 --> 15:09.107
and we're gonna find it.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.142
-[Huck] Stay ready, boys.
-[Jeff] Yeah.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.144
Watch your damn backs.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.780
This ain't a good spot
to try to defend anything.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.515
I'll tell you what,

15:17.517 --> 15:19.717
it's nice to have a little
solid rock here. A little...

15:19.719 --> 15:21.753
[Bill] Damn, look at
this. Look at this, Buck.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.755
- What you got, Bill?
- [Bill] Damn big slide mark here.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.756
Can y'all see that?

15:24.758 --> 15:27.458
- [Jeff] Hell yes.
- Look how long its foot is.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.793
- [Willy] That ain't no cow, boys.
- [Huck] No, sir.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.895
Willy, why don't you
jump up here and look up top?

15:30.897 --> 15:31.863
- See if you see anything that lurks there.
- Yeah.

15:31.865 --> 15:32.997
[Bill] Get your big
head and your ass up--

15:32.999 --> 15:35.099
Hey. Hey, Bill,
get up there with him.

15:35.101 --> 15:35.934
<i>[Willy] We can see
where something</i>

15:35.936 --> 15:37.568
just slid down off of this bank,

15:37.570 --> 15:38.870
right into this creek.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.371
[Jeff] That's a wide
animal right there.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.539
Holy [bleep], guys.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.608
<i>[Willy] Predators will come
down here to drink,</i>

15:43.610 --> 15:45.810
and also, they like to come
down by this creek to hunt.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.780
This place right here
is the perfect ambush spot.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.915
It looks like it stepped here
and then it slid here.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.784
I mean, you can see
where its foot stomped.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.786
It was definitely
headed that way.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.554
Right there is a big step,
right there.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.855
[Bill]
Down it went. Slid.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.758
[Willy] If that's the next step,
look at this son of a bitch.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.493
- That's where they're [bleep] at.
- [Buck] Wow.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.062
[Bill]
Look at that, boys.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.797
- That's a hillbilly stretch right there.
- Yes, sir.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.398
That'd puts his old nads
right there, Willy.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.534
[all laughing]

16:09.536 --> 16:10.668
- [Buck] Oh, Lord.
- A-ha!

16:10.670 --> 16:13.404
If he was short-legged
like me, his nads would be

16:13.406 --> 16:15.673
- hanging in the ground.
- Dragging in the ground.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.874
[all laughing]

16:16.876 --> 16:18.843
[Willy] I'd say
you're right, Bill.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.411
Man, all of sudden,
the skies opened up...

16:20.413 --> 16:21.279
[Bill] Holy hell!

16:21.281 --> 16:23.414
and the rain
started falling down.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.682
<i>We got drenched.</i>

16:24.684 --> 16:27.552
If this ain't monster-hunting
weather, I don't know what is.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.388
So yeah, a big, long
stride, [bleep] stepped here.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.924
Looks like it went right
on down through here.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.892
Boom! Boom!

16:34.894 --> 16:36.861
And it went that way.

16:36.863 --> 16:37.996
[Buck] It's starting
to come down now, ain't it?

16:37.998 --> 16:38.963
[Huck] Oh, yeah.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.733
Guys, welcome to Appalachia.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.801
- [all cheering]
- Yeah, baby!

16:43.803 --> 16:45.036
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

16:45.038 --> 16:46.971
- Let's go hunting.
- Yeah.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.873
Let's go monster hunting!

16:48.875 --> 16:49.941
Hell yeah!

16:49.943 --> 16:51.876
It's perfect monster-hunting
weather, guys.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.411
[Bill] Hell yeah!

16:53.413 --> 16:54.746
[Buck]
Guys, look at this rainbow.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.047
[Willy and Huckleberry]
Hell yeah!

16:56.049 --> 16:57.548
Right on Trapper's birthday.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.816
[Bill]
Yeah, it's gotta be...

16:58.818 --> 17:01.285
It's definitely got to be a
sign from the Big Brass.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.253
And we're walking
right under it.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.654
[Buck] Hell yeah, brother.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.991
[Huck] <i>All of a sudden, we
look up, and here's this rainbow.</i>

17:06.993 --> 17:10.595
Just a little one. It's like it
made a bridge across this creek.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.796
[Bill]
Thanks, Trapper!

17:11.798 --> 17:14.732
I can't help but feel
like old Trapper

17:14.734 --> 17:17.869
was looking down from
up above, smiling on us.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.604
Probably even laughing
his ass off

17:19.606 --> 17:20.671
<i>'cause we got soaked.</i>

17:20.673 --> 17:22.573
I love the hills
of West Virginia.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.808
- [Huck] Man.
- [Jeff] Oh, yeah.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.078
- [Bill] That's two of us.
- Don't get no better than this.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.780
-[Buck] She's a little mucky, boys.
-[Bill] Oh, yes.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.081
She's getting good here.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.784
This is a real monster
mud here, boys.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.053
[Buck] There's a little tree
right here we might be able to...

17:35.055 --> 17:36.687
- [Bill] Yeah.
- walk on.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.157
Little...
Old husky ninjas.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.725
Hey, hold on here.
I'm stuck.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.326
[Buck] Huh?

17:42.328 --> 17:43.561
- [Jeff grunts]
- [Willy] Hold up, gentlemen.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.863
- Wait a minute.
- [Jeff] Hold up, hold up.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.131
- Jethro's stuck.
- [Jeff] And I'm still sinking.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.866
Oh, man, Jethro.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.868
[Jeff] Oh, no, man.

17:50.870 --> 17:51.803
This is running over
my high-top boot.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.371
- Oh, wow.
- [Huck] Oh.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.907
[Bill] Hell,
he's in there up to his knees.

17:55.909 --> 17:59.043
Huck, put him in a high crotch
single and lift him straight up.

17:59.045 --> 17:59.877
[Jeff] Hey, wait a minute.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.646
[all laughing]

18:01.648 --> 18:03.748
[Huck] You don't need
to do that, Jeff.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.383
- It ain't gonna matter, buddy.
- Give me your arm, brother.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.686
- [Jeff grunting]
- Oh!

18:08.688 --> 18:10.021
Oh. Oh, that don't
look good.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.656
Ooh, that don't look good.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.491
Easy.
You're gonna knock me off.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.893
Keep going, boys.
Keep going, keep going.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.096
[Buck] You all have to wait a
second. You guys are rushing me.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.065
- [Jeff] Son of a bitch.
- [Bill] Look down!

18:21.800 --> 18:23.000
[Buck] Look!

18:23.335 --> 18:24.769
[Jeff] Oh, man.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.703
Hillbilly quicksand, boys.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.272
[all laughing]

18:28.274 --> 18:31.075
<i>[Buck] There are some things
that Jeff struggles with.</i>

18:31.077 --> 18:31.909
Fences.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.177
[Jeff grunting]

18:33.179 --> 18:34.812
- Gates.
- [Jeff grunting]

18:34.814 --> 18:36.080
That's a lot of ass.

18:36.648 --> 18:37.815
This time, it's mud.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.417
Everything I got is puckered.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.018
[all laughing]

18:41.020 --> 18:44.055
[Buck] <i>But one thing about
Jeff, he doesn't give up.</i>

18:44.057 --> 18:46.390
That man's got
the heart of a lion,

18:46.792 --> 18:48.326
body of a whale.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.096
Right this way, boys.
Following the creek.

18:52.098 --> 18:52.930
[Bill]
You guys making her?

18:52.932 --> 18:56.100
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.468
[Willy] Nice thing
about that rain, boys,

18:57.470 --> 18:59.237
- it covers down the scent of where we are.
- [Buck] Hey, look here.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.072
-Look here, look here.
-[Huck] What have you got?

19:01.840 --> 19:02.907
[Buck] Dang.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.643
[Bill] Big-ass bunch of
Cow bones, it looks like.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.112
- Daggone.
- [Willy] Check that out.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.947
How old of a cow
do you think that is?

19:09.949 --> 19:11.382
I don't think it's real old.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.418
I'd say three years old,
four years old.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.054
Well, looking at that
pelvic bone right there,

19:17.056 --> 19:20.691
you're looking at probably about
a 600 or 800 pound beef cow.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.726
- Yeah.
- Look here, guys,

19:21.728 --> 19:23.694
this is another way
you can tell.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.363
This cow hasn't given birth yet,

19:25.365 --> 19:26.764
- so it's fairly young.
- Yeah.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.866
[Huck] 'Cause this right
here... When they give birth,

19:28.868 --> 19:30.601
this right here splits
and it opens up,

19:30.603 --> 19:32.970
gives them more room
for the calf to come out.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.939
- Wow.
- [Huck] And it never really grows back.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.074
Wow. I didn't know that.
That's pretty cool.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.643
You can see right here,

19:38.645 --> 19:41.179
where something had
a very large mouth.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.713
Something shaped
with a bite like ours,

19:42.715 --> 19:44.815
not like a canine's mouth.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.784
You can see right there.
That'd be something big,

19:46.786 --> 19:49.387
- to bite a damn chunk of bone out that big.
- Hey, guys. Guys.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.157
Look at all these
fallen trees up there.

19:54.826 --> 19:55.726
Looks like there's
hundreds of 'em.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.362
- [Huck] Hell yeah.
- [Bill] Holy [bleep].

20:01.900 --> 20:04.068
[Buck] Is this
Land of the Fallen Trees?

20:05.604 --> 20:06.904
[Bill]
That'd be something big,

20:07.406 --> 20:10.675
- to bite a damn chunk of bone out that big.
- Hey, guys. Guys.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.376
Look at all these
fallen trees up there.

20:14.513 --> 20:15.412
Looks like there's
hundreds of 'em.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.982
- [Huck] Hell yes.
- [Bill] Holy [bleep].

20:18.617 --> 20:20.985
[Buck] Is this
Land of the Fallen Trees?

20:21.753 --> 20:23.287
<i>[Willy] We're standing there
in that creek,</i>

20:23.289 --> 20:27.858
<i>and Buck just looked up and spotted
a whole pile of these fallen trees.</i>

20:27.860 --> 20:29.927
They stretch all the way out
across that hill,

20:29.929 --> 20:30.962
further than I can see.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.597
There's a big root ball
down there.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.031
[Willy] That's a
big tree right there.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.467
<i>These trees don't look
like they'd been cut down.</i>

20:36.469 --> 20:38.803
<i>I can see the root balls
on the end of them,</i>

20:38.805 --> 20:40.605
and some of 'em look like
they've been snapped off.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.406
- Hey, Huck.
- Yeah.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.141
Remember what that boy said
the other night?

20:44.576 --> 20:45.676
[Huck chuckles]

20:45.978 --> 20:47.979
They was looking for
the Land of the Fallen Trees.

20:47.981 --> 20:50.414
Were you originally out here
looking for Goldschmidt Hill maybe?

20:50.949 --> 20:52.283
[man speaking]

20:53.552 --> 20:54.619
Yup, that's what he said.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.854
Well, I tell you,
right there is a [bleep] layer

20:56.856 --> 20:59.957
- of fallen trees with the roots and all.
- [Jeff] Yeah.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.260
Wait a second, wait a
second, wait a second.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.629
We need to check this out.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.531
But we're not getting
distracted this time.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.001
- We're gonna go find Goldschmidt Hill.
- [Huck] Yeah.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.670
We'll come back to this.
We need to get moving.

21:12.672 --> 21:13.471
- Okay.
- [Buck] All right?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.606
- Let's roll.
- [Jeff] Oh, yeah.

21:15.608 --> 21:19.076
[Buck] <i>All these fallen trees
are definitely interesting.</i>

21:19.078 --> 21:21.078
- [Willy] Dang.
<i>- [Buck] But nightfall is coming quick,</i>

21:21.080 --> 21:23.014
and we promised ourselves

21:23.016 --> 21:23.781
we wasn't leaving these woods

21:23.783 --> 21:25.583
until we found Goldschmidt Hill.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.686
I'm glad this ground is
starting to solid up a little bit.

21:28.688 --> 21:29.620
[Willy] Rain let up, birds
are starting to come out.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.722
- [Bill] Oh rains.
- Hey look here.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.324
- Oh, hell yeah.
- There's the fence.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.226
[Buck] Watch your
step through here.

21:35.228 --> 21:36.994
We got a couple of fallen logs.

21:38.730 --> 21:39.997
Now, here's the fence.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.199
We got a hill up this way.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.102
And we got a hill over this way.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.271
What I don't see...

21:47.806 --> 21:49.006
is a sign.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.041
Let's think about this
for a second.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.842
Guys, come over here.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.244
- Let's think about this.
- Oh yeah.

21:54.513 --> 21:58.649
Now Brad said that Ron
Goldschmidt was on an old dirt bike.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.885
And when he hit the
bottom of the hill,

22:00.887 --> 22:04.188
as he started up, his headlights
hit the Grafton Monster.

22:04.756 --> 22:07.391
He started up
and his headlights,

22:07.393 --> 22:10.061
he said, it just hit
this creature.

22:11.029 --> 22:15.166
That looks like you could get
a dirt bike up it, no problem.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.901
So, this could be it.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.336
[Bill] Right on,
yeah. Absolutely.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.538
- Hey Willy.
- Yeah?

22:20.540 --> 22:21.572
Won't you run
to the top of that hill.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.474
Why don't you play
dirt bike for a moment.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.876
Yeah, in case there's a sign
up there or something.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.411
<i>[Huck] We're sending
Willy up the hill,</i>

22:27.413 --> 22:29.347
to see if he can spot that sign.

22:31.850 --> 22:36.187
With this hill, in this angle, this
looks like it might be the right spot.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.255
[Willy] I ain't seeing
no sign of any kind.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.456
Damn.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.096
You'll see all these
fallen trees up on this view.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.997
All the way out through there.

22:47.265 --> 22:48.599
[Buck] Wow.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.935
And there's a whole pile of
trees down up here, ain't there?

22:50.937 --> 22:52.136
Hey, look at that.

22:52.404 --> 22:53.304
What?

22:53.306 --> 22:53.871
That first tree right there.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.406
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.375
Looks like it's got a couple
of nail holes on it.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.609
I'm gonna look at it.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.379
[Bill] Something could have
definitely been nailed on that.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.947
[Buck] That's definitely
a nail hole on the bottom.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.582
That's a bullet hole up top.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.750
- You see it?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.952
That looks like
a 7 Mag or a 300.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.987
As 12 gauge
shot gun with a slug.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.722
- All right.
- Right there.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.224
- Look here.
- [Huck] What you got?

23:13.859 --> 23:14.725
[Jeff] What is it?

23:14.727 --> 23:15.993
[Buck] Oh man.
Look at that.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.061
[Huck] What the hell
is it, Buck?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.229
[Buck sighs]

23:19.564 --> 23:20.531
- That's a board.
- Yeah.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.034
Guys, this might be
what we're looking for.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.070
<i>[Huck] We're standing
there looking at this old tree.</i>

23:26.072 --> 23:27.905
Take your time, keep working.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.374
All of a sudden Buck spots
something right down there in the mud.

23:30.376 --> 23:31.609
[Buck grunts]

23:31.611 --> 23:32.910
- [Huck] Keep pulling.
- [Buck] Old piece of rough cut.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.612
It looks like it might be
made out of wood.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.480
But it's damned old.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.816
- Yeah.
- Yeah, got a live edge on it still doesn't it?

23:38.818 --> 23:40.551
That damn thing--
That thing's in there a ways.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.819
Jeez. Criminy!

23:41.821 --> 23:43.087
[Huck]
<i>We don't know what this is.</i>

23:43.089 --> 23:44.989
But we sure as hell
need to dig it up.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.223
There you go.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.425
- Nothing to it.
- Yeah.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.929
- [Bill] It's got writing on it.
- [Buck] Sure does.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.230
I think it's a sign.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.765
- Yeah.
- Son of a bitch, it looks like one.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.000
All right.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.836
Willy, get your big ass
down here, we found a sign!

23:58.838 --> 24:01.038
- Yeah.
- [Willy] You found a sign?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.574
[Bill] Hell yeah!
Come on down here!

24:03.576 --> 24:05.810
Guys, I think this is it.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.011
Let's wash it off
over here in the creek.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.111
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.547
- Let's give it a hillbilly bath.
- [Bill] Hell yeah!

24:09.549 --> 24:11.348
- [Jeff] Dust her off, yeah.
- [Bill] I'm a going take it.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.583
We just pulled up
this old piece of wood.

24:12.585 --> 24:16.821
It's cracked, covered in mud,
and severely weathered.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.323
<i>We need to clean it up and
see if it has any writing on it.</i>

24:19.325 --> 24:20.190
[Bill] Hell yeah.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.425
[Buck] All right,
here we go. Heads up.

24:22.694 --> 24:24.795
- Grab me... grab my rifle.
- [Huck] All right.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.763
Wash that off for a second.

24:25.765 --> 24:26.564
[Willy] Yeah, clean her up.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.865
[Huck] You getting any letters?

24:27.867 --> 24:29.867
-Hang on there. Hang on then, boys.
-Come on, Bill, hurry up.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.802
[Bill] Yeah, you ain't gonna
believe this [bleep], boys.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.970
What you got?

24:33.071 --> 24:34.205
Check this out!

24:34.207 --> 24:35.039
[all exclaiming]

24:35.041 --> 24:36.307
[all cheering]

24:38.844 --> 24:42.079
- By God we hit pay dirt, boys.
- [Huck] Hell yeah.

24:42.948 --> 24:44.048
You can't deny that.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.716
Ron Goldschmidt.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.985
- About time.
- We got it.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.554
Bill picks that sign up
and holds it up,

24:50.556 --> 24:54.892
and there it is, bam!
The legend of Ron Goldschmidt.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.994
- By God we hit pay dirt, didn't we?
- [all] Yeah.

24:56.996 --> 24:57.628
[Jeff chuckling]

24:57.630 --> 24:58.795
- Hell yeah!
- Yeah.

24:58.797 --> 25:01.765
<i>[Huck] It took some damn
detective work to find it,</i>

25:01.767 --> 25:04.368
but this is the damn sign
that we've been looking for.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.936
And by God, we just found her.

25:05.938 --> 25:06.737
Well, guys...

25:08.240 --> 25:09.673
I believe we found
Goldschmidt Hill.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.908
[Bill] My God, I think
you're right, Buckaroo.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.244
- Right up there.
- [Buck] Yeah.

25:13.246 --> 25:15.145
There's a couple of
things we need to do.

25:15.747 --> 25:16.347
First...

25:16.781 --> 25:18.782
I wanna figure out...

25:18.784 --> 25:20.751
if this is the
Land of the Fallen Trees.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.019
- [Jeff] Yeah.
- [Huck] Yeah.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.855
By God, if it ain't I don't
know what in the hell would be.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.858
And the second thing is
I'm gonna talk to Brad again.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.425
[Jeff] About what?

25:28.427 --> 25:29.760
Yeah?

25:29.762 --> 25:31.295
There was something he said
when we spoke

25:31.763 --> 25:34.098
that has stuck out to me.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.966
And we need to have
a discussion with him.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.134
Trust me.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.335
I'll fill you all in.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.170
But it's getting late.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.372
We ain't got our lights.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.207
We ain't got the thermal.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.342
And we're back in the hollow
as far as you can stick a knife.

25:45.344 --> 25:46.377
- Yep.
- Yeah.

25:46.745 --> 25:47.845
So...

25:47.847 --> 25:49.313
We need to head out of here.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.915
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do it, Bill.

25:50.917 --> 25:51.715
- Take off, bud.
- Doing it, brother.

25:51.717 --> 25:52.850
Let's get her.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.685
<i>[Buck] We may have
found Goldschmidt Hill.</i>

25:54.687 --> 25:55.619
<i>But, there's a couple
of questions I have.</i>

25:55.621 --> 25:57.187
[Bill] Follow me, Jethro.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.123
- [Buck] Yeah, come on, Jethro!
- [Jeff] Oh yeah, you bet I am.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.791
<i>[Buck] What's the
Land of the Fallen Trees?</i>

26:00.793 --> 26:02.126
[Jeff] Oh, [bleep].

26:02.128 --> 26:03.360
And there's something else.

26:03.995 --> 26:04.762
[gasps]

26:04.764 --> 26:06.397
[Huck] Uh-oh.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.198
The monster
that Brad described...

26:08.200 --> 26:10.701
It was real dark.
It was like almost black.

26:10.703 --> 26:11.602
[softly] Wow.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.372
I don't think it's
the Grafton Monster.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.942
We need to talk to him.

26:17.944 --> 26:18.609
[Jeff] My balls are wet.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.344
[all chuckling]

26:22.180 --> 26:23.914
[Huck] You can't even
really tell from back here.

26:23.916 --> 26:24.948
[all chuckling]

26:29.788 --> 26:30.621
[Buck] Brad, I really
appreciate you coming out

26:30.956 --> 26:31.855
and meeting with us
again tonight.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.657
Absolutely.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.926
Tonight, we're meeting up
with an eyewitness

26:35.928 --> 26:37.027
<i>that we've already met with.</i>

26:37.029 --> 26:38.028
<i>Brad.</i>

26:38.096 --> 26:39.797
<i>Ever since we met with
Brad the other day,</i>

26:39.799 --> 26:42.900
I haven't been able to get
something he said out of my mind.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.802
<i>We asked him to
come back out again tonight,</i>

26:44.804 --> 26:46.737
sit around the campfire with us,

26:46.739 --> 26:47.871
<i>and see if we can't
talk to him again.</i>

26:47.873 --> 26:49.840
I think if he gets comfortable

26:49.842 --> 26:51.342
we might be able to
get some more out of him.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.612
Since we met with you
the other day,

26:54.614 --> 26:58.015
man, we have worked
our rear-ends off

26:58.017 --> 27:00.017
trying to find Goldschmidt Hill.

27:00.185 --> 27:02.119
And you made it sound so easy.

27:02.121 --> 27:02.519
[chuckling]

27:02.521 --> 27:04.955
[all chuckling]

27:04.957 --> 27:07.725
Now you understand why I said
I wasn't going out there with you.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.193
[all chuckling]

27:12.397 --> 27:14.765
But, finally we located it.
[chuckling]

27:14.767 --> 27:16.033
- Yeah.
- Exactly right.

27:16.035 --> 27:16.867
It was right by that fence.

27:16.869 --> 27:17.801
-Yep
-Yeah.

27:18.737 --> 27:20.504
Brad, when we met with you
the other day

27:20.506 --> 27:23.407
there was a couple of
things that stood out to us.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.010
And that's the reason we
wanted to get you out here tonight,

27:26.012 --> 27:28.112
- because we have a couple of questions for you.
- [Huck] Yeah.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.014
Okay.

27:31.082 --> 27:33.017
When you was talking to us...

27:33.785 --> 27:35.119
you told us...

27:35.121 --> 27:37.287
that when you
seen this creature...

27:38.990 --> 27:40.991
it had black hair.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.627
It was real dark.
It was like almost black.

27:43.629 --> 27:44.995
[softly] Wow.

27:47.899 --> 27:50.067
The Grafton Monster
don't have black hair.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.405
So, now I'm kinda
starting to second-guess

27:54.407 --> 27:57.007
what you actually seen.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.711
I'm starting to wonder if
there's something else out here.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.046
That is what I'm getting at.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.881
And I say this with all respect.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.449
'Cause I'm definitely
not trying to attack you.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.885
I just-- I'm very curious, um...

28:07.887 --> 28:10.854
Because you seemed kind of
reserved about your story.

28:10.856 --> 28:14.158
And, I guess maybe I'm
kinda wondering if

28:14.160 --> 28:17.261
maybe you've seen something
that wasn't the Grafton Monster.

28:19.064 --> 28:20.230
So...

28:22.133 --> 28:23.267
You're right.

28:23.401 --> 28:24.668
Wow.

28:25.403 --> 28:27.137
There's something else
in these woods.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.374
And it's not the
Grafton Monster.

28:31.943 --> 28:36.013
There's something out here that
makes it look like chicken scratch.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.315
[softly] Holy [bleep].

28:38.750 --> 28:39.983
So...

28:40.351 --> 28:43.120
when you seen it in 2006...

28:43.122 --> 28:45.289
- you knew it wasn't the Grafton Monster.
- I knew it wasn't.

28:46.324 --> 28:47.557
Wow.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.027
And I don't know if I really
want to talk about it or not.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.996
Because to this day it
haunts me in my nightmares.

28:56.868 --> 28:58.268
Well, um...

29:00.905 --> 29:02.973
So I understand your reluctancy.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.008
Because it's not easy to say.

29:05.042 --> 29:05.809
It's rough.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.644
Yes, it is. It's very rough.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.813
But, let me tell you something.

29:09.815 --> 29:12.883
I've had an encounter, I know
the things you go through.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.118
I understand.

29:14.719 --> 29:15.786
But we'd love for
you to clue us in

29:15.788 --> 29:19.356
on what else is
in this country here.

29:19.358 --> 29:23.227
Because right now we've got
our backs up against the wall.

29:24.229 --> 29:28.165
And we'd like to know what the
hell we're gonna get up against.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.803
This creature...

29:32.805 --> 29:35.806
[sighs] I don't know,
I don't even, I--

29:35.808 --> 29:38.008
I've never told
anybody about this.

29:38.843 --> 29:41.979
It was in 2006 and I was...

29:41.981 --> 29:44.148
It wasn't in-- on that
same hill though.

29:46.651 --> 29:47.417
Where was it at?

29:48.853 --> 29:50.988
We had lost a cow that evening,

29:50.990 --> 29:52.723
and I was out looking for it.

29:52.725 --> 29:53.824
And...

29:54.726 --> 29:57.427
I had broken off from
the rest of everybody else,

29:57.429 --> 29:59.830
because I knew this one hollow
that had a natural salt lake in it.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.199
I figured that's where
this cow had went.

30:02.634 --> 30:06.537
So, I started up in the hollow
and I found the cow.

30:06.539 --> 30:10.941
For what I-- Let's rephrase that,
I found what was left of the cow.

30:14.412 --> 30:16.680
This cow had been
ripped apart limb to limb.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.749
And we're not talking about
a small cow here.

30:18.751 --> 30:20.984
We're talking about
a 700 pound cow

30:20.986 --> 30:23.987
that looked like it had just
been ran through a meat grinder.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.222
- Wow.
- Oh my gosh.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.356
Jeez.

30:27.392 --> 30:28.058
[exhales]

30:28.060 --> 30:29.226
So...

30:29.861 --> 30:31.995
Me being young, dumb me...

30:31.997 --> 30:33.964
invincible, made of steel,

30:33.966 --> 30:36.366
I take off in the woods...

30:36.368 --> 30:39.036
I'm gonna find
what did this to my cow.

30:40.672 --> 30:44.274
And I go on up the hollow
and I come to this area that

30:44.276 --> 30:47.277
we call the Land of
the Fallen Trees.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.214
Wow.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.084
So, I take it, you all
came across this place?

30:54.886 --> 30:56.086
Yep.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.255
Look at all these
fallen trees up here.

31:00.558 --> 31:02.326
It's well known around here.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.362
Most people know to
stay out, but...

31:06.931 --> 31:11.201
I'm telling you, Goldschmidt
Hill isn't half as bad as

31:11.203 --> 31:14.037
what the Land of
the Fallen Trees is.

31:15.974 --> 31:16.606
Wow.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.208
Though, let me tell you...

31:18.210 --> 31:21.345
whenever I got to the edge of
the clearing where the trees are...

31:22.614 --> 31:24.147
there it stood.

31:24.782 --> 31:27.317
Right there just looking at me
like it was waiting on me.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.354
And wherever it
looked at me I just froze.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.354
And then I...

31:32.190 --> 31:34.491
I don't know if
I cried or I [bleep] myself

31:34.493 --> 31:36.159
or if I pissed down my leg.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.029
Because next thing I know
I'm running out of the woods

31:39.031 --> 31:40.731
and I, I--

31:40.733 --> 31:42.532
I don't know what happened.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.034
What did it look like?

31:44.036 --> 31:47.504
This thing was nine feet tall,
it was covered in dark hair.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.907
Long fingernails.

31:49.909 --> 31:53.043
It had these reddest eyes
that I've ever seen in my life.

31:53.045 --> 31:56.213
They were like cherry red
and glow-- glowing.

31:58.383 --> 31:59.616
The face...

31:59.618 --> 32:01.818
The face was almost human like,

32:01.820 --> 32:05.222
but it wasn't like any person
you've ever seen in your life.

32:07.392 --> 32:08.992
What do you think it was?

32:12.163 --> 32:14.665
I don't think it was anything.
I know it was a Bigfoot.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.934
[Huck] Oh, boy.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.174
Well that's about as
direct as you can get.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.144
There's no other explanation.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.880
- I don't doubt you one minute, just know that.
- No, no, no. [chuckles]

32:29.882 --> 32:31.415
[Huck] Wow. Man.

32:32.016 --> 32:33.917
So. Hmm.

32:33.919 --> 32:36.286
So that was back in 2006.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.290
How many more
encounters have you had?

32:40.625 --> 32:42.826
[Brad exhales]

32:42.828 --> 32:45.062
Physically seeing it,
I've not seen it again.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.396
Thank God.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.167
But, I hear it frequently.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.135
[chuckles sarcastically]

32:52.971 --> 32:54.204
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.272
[Buck] What's it sound like?

32:57.075 --> 32:59.276
I can't really describe it...

33:00.411 --> 33:01.878
but I can let you hear it.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.880
What?

33:03.882 --> 33:05.382
I've got recordings,
would you like to hear it?

33:05.783 --> 33:07.718
You...

33:07.720 --> 33:08.852
[both] You've got a recording?

33:08.854 --> 33:09.853
I've got recordings of it.

33:09.855 --> 33:12.189
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes, sir.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.858
Brad said he's got a recording
of this Bigfoot.

33:14.860 --> 33:15.559
Are you ready?

33:15.561 --> 33:16.860
Oh, we gotta hear it.

33:16.862 --> 33:20.097
Nobody else has ever
heard this before.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.431
I've never played it
for anybody else.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.200
Let's hear it.

33:23.801 --> 33:24.735
Play it, Brad.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.436
Wait till you all hear this.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.173
[high pitched
animal-like sounds]

33:30.975 --> 33:32.843
Oh man.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.144
[Jeff] Holy cow. [exhales]

33:34.211 --> 33:35.912
Daggone.

33:35.914 --> 33:37.981
Listen to that.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.049
[animal-like growls]

33:39.450 --> 33:40.417
Oh.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.253
- [growling continues]
- [whispers] Damn.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.389
That's not a Bigfoot.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.091
That's two Bigfoots.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.063
[Brad] Wait till
you all hear this.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.133
[high pitched
animal-like sounds]

33:56.901 --> 33:58.935
Oh man.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.270
[Jeff] Holy cow. [exhales]

34:00.405 --> 34:02.039
Daggone.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.074
- Listen to that.
- [high pitched squeals]

34:04.076 --> 34:05.142
[animal-like growls]

34:05.610 --> 34:07.044
Oh.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.279
- [growling continues]
- [whispers] Damn.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.015
That's not a Bigfoot.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.084
That's two Bigfoots.

34:14.986 --> 34:16.386
Holy [bleep].

34:17.922 --> 34:20.323
- [animal-like sounds continue]
- That's the other one right there.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.727
You can hear the
distance between the two.

34:23.729 --> 34:26.563
Yeah, it sounds like
one's on-- up one hollow

34:26.565 --> 34:28.432
-and then the-- up the other end.
-[Jeff] Yeah.

34:29.867 --> 34:32.869
They're 100%
communicating with each other.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.938
And that male
sounds deep chested.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.039
Oh yeah.

34:36.041 --> 34:36.873
Yeah.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.175
[Jeff] Wow.

34:38.843 --> 34:41.244
Guys, my mind's
a little blown right now.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.280
We don't just have a Bigfoot.

34:44.215 --> 34:45.182
We've got two.

34:45.983 --> 34:49.019
And, we have the
Grafton Monster.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.589
<i>In these woods right now,</i>

34:52.591 --> 34:54.091
<i>we know there's wolves.</i>

34:54.093 --> 34:57.394
<i>Smoke Wolves,
the Grafton Monster.</i>

34:57.396 --> 35:00.597
And now two Bigfoots.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.631
Brad, your story's definitely

35:01.633 --> 35:03.733
gonna make us have to
re-think some things.

35:03.735 --> 35:06.536
- Oh yeah.
- This whole investigation just got turned on its head.

35:06.538 --> 35:11.408
I'd like to know, what in the
world did Trapper get us into?

35:28.092 --> 35:30.861
Guys, this is why we came back
to Tygart Valley in the first place.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.095
- Oh yeah.
- Oh.

35:32.097 --> 35:33.830
To get back on the
hunt for Bigfoot.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.132
And tonight...

35:35.833 --> 35:36.766
we're hitting the
ground running.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.602
- Oh yeah.
- All right.

35:38.604 --> 35:39.870
- Double time!
- That's right.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.905
Best place, I think,
we can start,

35:41.907 --> 35:43.573
is out there in the
Land of the Fallen Trees.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.942
That's where Brag
had his encounter.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.612
And he just recently had
an audio recording out there.

35:48.614 --> 35:49.746
- Oh yeah.
- That's a good spot.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.648
Let's go down there
and find us a biggun.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.850
I think if we go out there
we can start looking around,

35:53.852 --> 35:55.752
see if it's an active hot-spot.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.522
We'll look for all the
typical signs we look for.

35:58.524 --> 36:02.025
Tracks, bent over trees,
stacked rocks.

36:02.027 --> 36:04.394
You know, we're gonna be
looking for any sign

36:04.396 --> 36:06.129
that there's a Bigfoot
in the area right now.

36:06.131 --> 36:06.730
Right.

36:06.732 --> 36:07.797
- Hell yeah.
- Hell yeah.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.833
Let's load up and head out
to the end of the field.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.701
- All right guys, all right.
- Yeah!

36:11.703 --> 36:14.471
After our meeting today
we're all fired up,

36:14.473 --> 36:17.874
our engines are revving,
our feet are on the ground.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.110
[Huck] Were out at the end of the
field, see if we can't find that fence row.

36:20.112 --> 36:23.013
We need to get to
the Land of the Fallen Trees.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.617
[Buck] New territory, Boys.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.085
[chuckling]

36:29.087 --> 36:31.021
[Buck] Now, I see
a fence up there now.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.689
- Look there!
- Hell yeah!

36:32.691 --> 36:33.924
[Bill] Oh yeah, buddy.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.026
- Shining like a new penny.
- [Huck] Yeah!

36:37.428 --> 36:39.429
- All right!
- Hell yeah, we're here.

36:39.431 --> 36:42.132
<i>We just hit the fence line
We need to grab our weapons,</i>

36:42.134 --> 36:42.999
and head over the hill.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.100
So, let's go.

36:44.402 --> 36:47.070
<i>Brad told us about the
Land of the Fallen Trees.</i>

36:47.072 --> 36:49.339
That's where he had
his encounter with Bigfoot.

36:49.341 --> 36:52.609
That is exactly where we need
to start this investigation.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.278
[Bill] Yeah, we're going down
in the big forest now, boys.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.414
- [Huck] Yes, we are.
- [Jeff] Here we go, baby.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.787
[Jeff] Welcome to the
mountains of Tygart Valley.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.755
- [Buck] Yeah. [chuckles]
- [Huck] Yeah, that's for sure.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.824
[Bill] The terrain up here
is unforgiving.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.760
[Buck] Check out
this big root ball.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.563
Damn, that thing's been
uprooted like hell, ain't it?

37:13.565 --> 37:15.799
- Hey guys.
- [Bill] Yeah.

37:15.801 --> 37:18.235
I think we've found the
Land of the Fallen Trees.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.138
I think you're right, Buckaroo.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.675
[Buck] Check out
this big root ball.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.844
Damn, that thing's been
uprooted like hell, ain't it?

37:27.846 --> 37:30.614
- Hey guys.
- [Bill] Yeah.

37:30.616 --> 37:33.083
I think we've found the
Land of the Fallen Trees.

37:34.652 --> 37:36.953
[Bill] I think
you're right, Buckaroo.

37:38.489 --> 37:40.991
<i>[Bill] We're looking around
and holy hell,</i>

37:40.993 --> 37:43.927
<i>there's damn pieces of
trees everywhere.</i>

37:43.929 --> 37:45.161
What could have done this?

37:45.163 --> 37:48.131
Look like a damn tornado come
through here and tore up jack.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.033
- [heaving, exhaling]
- [muttering]

37:50.768 --> 37:52.235
Here, come here
and check this out, Will.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.704
[Buck] Look at this.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.740
- [Willy] Holy [bleep].
- I'm standing on big dead white oak.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.676
Is that red oak right there?

37:59.678 --> 38:02.679
Yeah, that right there's a
red oak that's been broke off.

38:02.681 --> 38:06.716
You got a piece of elm in here
that's been snapped off in there.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.618
There's even a piece
of ash right there.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.053
[Buck] Oh yeah, I see it.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.889
<i>[Bill] I'm looking down and I'm
seeing all kinds of damn trees.</i>

38:12.891 --> 38:14.324
I'm seeing white oak,

38:14.859 --> 38:16.059
<i>I'm seeing red oak.</i>

38:16.061 --> 38:17.494
<i>I'm seeing walnut.</i>

38:17.496 --> 38:21.698
<i>Cherry, maple, locust, beech.</i>

38:21.700 --> 38:23.900
Top of this white oak's
been broken clear out.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.468
And, dude white oak
is freakin' tough.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.905
Some of the toughest wood
they are, is white oak.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.975
<i>[Bill] Every kind of single tree
you can think of in Appalachia</i>

38:31.977 --> 38:34.944
<i>is down on the ground,
busted all to hell.</i>

38:34.946 --> 38:37.280
And are stacked
one on top of another.

38:37.282 --> 38:39.082
What the hell done that?

38:39.084 --> 38:41.651
Guys, we have no heavy
equipment tracks up here.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.552
- No.
- Right.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.586
The drop off's right there,

38:43.588 --> 38:45.922
this is a solid mountain,
straight up and down.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.657
[Bill] You couldn't get a
billy goat up here.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.858
You're probably right, Bill.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.327
I'm gonna throw
another one at you.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.295
Which way is the
wind coming from?

38:52.730 --> 38:54.764
That way right over there.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.901
Which direction does
all the trees point?

38:57.903 --> 38:59.569
- [Huck] Yeah.
- [chuckles] The opposite.

38:59.571 --> 39:00.770
[Buck] Exactly.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.906
So, it wasn't the wind that
knocked them down, right?

39:02.908 --> 39:04.607
- [Bill] Right.
- You've got a point.

39:04.609 --> 39:05.975
You guys remember what happened

39:05.977 --> 39:07.844
the last time we was
in the Tygart Valley?

39:07.846 --> 39:08.511
In the middle of the night.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.080
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.

39:10.082 --> 39:12.982
We woke up and there was
trees busted all over the place.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.150
We could hear 'em crashing

39:14.152 --> 39:15.685
down it sounded like

39:15.687 --> 39:17.187
a herd of elephants
going through the woods.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.122
[Bill] God, it destroyed this.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.590
Look at this.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.225
[Willy] Holy hell!

39:22.227 --> 39:23.993
Guys, you gotta check this out.

39:25.396 --> 39:26.663
- Dang! Cool!
- [Bill] Holy hell!

39:26.665 --> 39:30.133
Whatever the hell busted
that is damn well big.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.670
Well, it come in here and
knocked all these trees down.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.739
And everything's
been broke off too.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.774
You just see where
it's been snapped off.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.976
- [Huck] Hey guys.
- [Buck] Yeah.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.778
[Huck] Come on here
and check this out.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.114
- What do you got?
- What do you got, Huck?

39:44.116 --> 39:46.282
[Huck] It looks like to me
it might be a den.

39:46.917 --> 39:47.483
- A den?
- Really?

39:47.485 --> 39:49.753
- Yeah.
- Wow. [bleep]

39:49.755 --> 39:51.721
- [Buck] Let's check that out.
- [Huck] It's either a den or the start of one.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.189
Let me check that out, Huck.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.125
- Hell yeah.
- What do you got there, Huckleberry?

39:55.127 --> 39:55.725
Yeah.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.660
Big ass den of some kind.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.429
[Huck] Oh wow.
I mean, look at that.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.866
[Jeff] Damn, that does
look like a big den.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.001
Well it looks like he goes
back in there for a piece.

40:05.003 --> 40:05.835
- Yeah.
- [branch cracks]

40:05.837 --> 40:06.970
[all exclaiming]

40:06.972 --> 40:08.071
- What was that?
- What was that?

40:08.073 --> 40:08.838
[Huck] Easy now, easy.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.540
Daggone.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.841
Man, something's going
down the hill there!

40:11.843 --> 40:13.777
Or did it come out
of that den right there?

40:13.779 --> 40:15.011
Jeff, hit it with that thermal.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.213
[Jeff] I'm moving.
Like, I'm moving on it fast.

40:17.215 --> 40:20.116
Just like a fat boy
chasing a ice cream truck.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.284
[chuckling]

40:21.919 --> 40:23.086
What?

40:23.088 --> 40:24.154
[snickering]

40:24.156 --> 40:25.722
[chuckling]

40:25.724 --> 40:27.123
[Huck] Oh God.

40:29.493 --> 40:31.161
[all laugh loudly]

40:37.868 --> 40:40.036
Willy, Bill, why don't you guys
go in there and check that out?

40:40.038 --> 40:41.070
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.305
Jeff, you wanna get in there?

40:42.907 --> 40:44.274
I don't think I'll fit.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.241
[all chuckling]

40:47.077 --> 40:48.278
Too many ice creams!

40:48.779 --> 40:49.979
[all chuckling]

40:51.415 --> 40:52.949
All right, go ahead, Will.

40:53.016 --> 40:55.185
Looks like a den.

40:57.621 --> 40:58.888
That's a big hole back in there.

40:58.890 --> 41:01.224
There could be something
in there bigger than hell.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.159
Easy does it.
Easy does it, Willy. Easy.

41:03.161 --> 41:03.893
Damn.

41:03.895 --> 41:06.329
That does look like a big den.

41:08.432 --> 41:11.501
We just heard a noise, and it sounded
like it was coming from that den.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.903
Willy's gonna slip in there
and see what he can find.

41:13.905 --> 41:16.005
That son of a bitch
goes way back in there.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.040
[Bill] Hell yes, it does.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.542
Go slow like an old snail.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.811
Well, I'm going in,
you guys got my back?

41:21.813 --> 41:23.012
- We got your back.
- I've got your back, Will.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.747
Easy, Brother. Easy.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.816
- Move in slow.
- Damn right.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.319
- [Willy] Damn, I can smell something musty.
- [Bill] Damn, easy, bro.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.586
I don't like this at all.

41:31.956 --> 41:34.123
- You got anything on the thermal, Jeff?
- [Jeff] I'm looking.

41:34.692 --> 41:37.193
Go easy, Willy.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.028
- Be careful, Bud.
- [Bill] Be careful, bro.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.064
[Willy] Man, it's
awful big in here.

41:41.066 --> 41:43.800
There's some musty
smelling stink.

41:43.802 --> 41:44.400
[rustling sound]

41:44.402 --> 41:45.067
[loud exclaiming]

41:45.069 --> 41:46.002
[inaudible shouting]

41:46.004 --> 41:47.403
[Buck] That was inside of there!

41:47.405 --> 41:48.671
Someone get in there to him.

41:48.673 --> 41:49.806
[gasps]

41:49.808 --> 41:50.573
I'm looking
I'm not seeing anything.

41:50.575 --> 41:51.808
I'm coming in, I'm coming in!

41:51.810 --> 41:53.910
- Stay close to me, Jeff.
- Will, you all right?

41:53.912 --> 41:54.978
[Bill] Son of a bitch.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.346
[shouting] Willy!
