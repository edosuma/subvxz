00:15.000 --> 00:20.989
Tonight... I sit on a rock... James
gets something in his eye... Oh! And

00:21.000 --> 00:32.989
Richard says, "Mummy!" Oh, mummy!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.989
Thank you, hello! Hello, good
evening, thank you so much. Thank

00:40.000 --> 00:43.989
you, now... Now, tonight's show...
Tonight's show is interesting

00:44.000 --> 00:48.989
because we have all sort of reverted
to type. Later

00:49.000 --> 00:52.989
desert driving like an idiot in a
large and

00:53.000 --> 00:55.989
desert driving like an idiot in a
in northern Italy driving a rather

00:56.000 --> 00:58.989
elegant sports car and James, well
actually, we are kicking off with

00:59.000 --> 01:02.989
James, who really is in his comfort
zone because he is on a Second World

01:03.000 --> 01:13.989
War air base talking about a car
from the 1950s.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.989
This is The Stig taking a Caterham
to the ragged edge on our track back

01:18.000 --> 01:26.989
in 2008.
That particular lap is something of

01:27.000 --> 01:30.989
an Internet sensation. It's been
viewed over 100 times and one of the

01:31.000 --> 01:33.989
reasons it's so popular is because
that is the Caterham R500, the most

01:34.000 --> 01:43.989
powerful and extreme car they have
ever built. Or, rather, it was.

01:44.000 --> 01:54.989
Because its crown has just been
stolen by this. The brand new

01:55.000 --> 02:02.989
Caterham 620R. Where the old 500 had
263hp, this has 310. And since it

02:03.000 --> 02:10.989
weighs just 545kg, it has a better
power to weight ratio than a Bugatti

02:11.000 --> 02:15.989
Veyron. But I have driven a Bugatti
Veyron and I have to say it was very

02:16.000 --> 02:19.989
civilised. Let's see how this
compares.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.989
ENGINE REVS.
Oh! Bloody Nora! Oh! Argh! Argh!

02:23.000 --> 02:36.989
Argh!
ENGINE DROWNS SPEECH.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.989
I can't see! Oh! Ow!
BLEEP. ?? new line Argh!

02:44.000 --> 02:49.989
God above, that's not... That's not
like acceleration, that's like being

02:50.000 --> 02:54.989
in a football and somebody kicks it.
Ugh!

02:55.000 --> 02:59.989
'With a helmet and goggles
deputising for the windscreen, 'I

03:00.000 --> 03:02.989
tried once more to get to grips with
the 620R.' Obviously, you can tell

03:03.000 --> 03:17.989
from the way I'm screaming at you,
the racket in here is tremendous.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.989
It's quite difficult to breathe.
'That's hardly surprising since 0-60

03:22.000 --> 03:30.989
takes just 2.8 seconds.
'And it's not like you can get your

03:31.000 --> 03:35.989
breath back in the corners.' TYRES
SCREECH.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.989
Geez.
HE COUGHS.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.989
Right, this time, watch this.
TYRES SCREECH.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.989
Oh, not again. Sorry. There'll be a
lot of editing to do on this piece.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.989
'Stick at it for several months and
you can bring the 620R to heel.'

03:56.000 --> 04:08.989
Whey, hey-hey!
'And when you get your eye in, it's

04:09.000 --> 04:11.989
not a bad car.' It's still a
Caterham. It's all very crisp. Very

04:12.000 --> 04:25.989
nice. Fantastic sequential gearbox.
'It's just that it's too much hard

04:26.000 --> 04:29.989
work.' The trouble is this is power
piled on power. It can barely

04:30.000 --> 04:34.989
contain itself. It's like a teenager
left alone with the Internet. The

04:35.000 --> 04:39.989
wheels and the suspension can only
just keep up with what's going on.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.989
Whey-hey! It's not supposed to be
like this. It's just a little

04:45.000 --> 04:45.989
Whey-hey! It's not supposed to be
car! 'However, I think I have an

04:46.000 --> 04:50.989
answer to the problem.' You see, I
car! 'However, I think I have an

04:51.000 --> 04:57.989
minimalist car, you need to take a
minimalist approach to performance

04:58.000 --> 05:00.989
and handling, as well. It's no good
just piling on more and more power,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.989
that's like trying to improve a
curry by putting more and more

05:06.000 --> 05:07.989
chillies in it. What I'm trying to
say is, well, Caterham needs to find

05:08.000 --> 05:17.989
a better Indian restaurant.
Fortunately it seems they're ahead

05:18.000 --> 05:20.989
of me on this one. Alongside their
new, most powerful car ever, they've

05:21.000 --> 05:26.989
also come up with this, their least
powerful car ever. It's called the

05:27.000 --> 05:27.989
160 and it has just 80hp from a tiny
turbo-charged three-cylinder Suzuki

05:28.000 --> 05:40.989
engine.
So the engine is much smaller but

05:41.000 --> 05:50.989
then so is the price. The 620R is
?50,000. This is just ?17,000.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.989
Admittedly, 0-60 takes a gentle
seven seconds and the top speed is

06:02.000 --> 06:06.989
only 100. But that's not the point.
Top speed, 0-60, they're just

06:07.000 --> 06:12.989
numbers. They are meaningless in
themselves. What matters is whether

06:13.000 --> 06:16.989
or not they add up into a sensation
and this delivers a tremendous

06:17.000 --> 06:22.989
sensation.
TYRES SCREECH.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.989
HE CHUCKLES.
The key to the 160's sense of fun is

06:29.000 --> 06:33.989
a set of super skinny tyres. They
are only a tiny bit wider than a

06:34.000 --> 06:37.989
space saver. So you only have to
twitch your foot a little bit...

06:38.000 --> 06:44.989
TYRES SCREECH.
..and you can slide around like

06:45.000 --> 06:50.989
TYRES SCREECH.
Hakkinen. Oh, lovely! Look at me.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.989
Whoo! When you have worn your tyres
out, they're only 40 quid each to

06:59.000 --> 07:02.989
replace. Even The Stig, who normally
turns his snout up at anything with

07:03.000 --> 07:06.989
less than 500hp, had an absolute
ball.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.989
It has a windscreen. It'll do over
50 miles to the gallon. As far as

07:14.000 --> 07:18.989
I'm concerned, it's the best car
Caterham has ever made. In fact,

07:19.000 --> 07:24.989
there's only one thing wrong with
it. The way it looks. Next to the

07:25.000 --> 07:29.989
latest stripped out sports cars like
the Ariel Atom, and the BAC Mono, it

07:30.000 --> 07:32.989
sits a bit like a typewriter in an
Internet cafe. I wonder if they

07:33.000 --> 07:43.989
could do something about that?
As it happens, they're ahead of me

07:44.000 --> 07:48.989
on that one, too. This is the
AeroSeven. It's been developed with

07:49.000 --> 07:52.989
the help of the Caterham F1 team.
The great thing is, it isn't some

07:53.000 --> 08:04.989
static papier mache one-off built
for a motor show stand.

08:05.000 --> 08:17.989
Positively down on gastrique by
Caterham standards. The next thing

08:18.000 --> 08:23.989
you know, they'll have a fax
machine. The AeroSeven isn't going

08:24.000 --> 08:33.989
into production for a year or so.
Before it does, there's one major

08:34.000 --> 08:45.989
thing they need to fix. Ow! Oh! It
hasn't got a windscreen! Useless!

08:46.000 --> 08:51.989
The best car they've ever made?
According to him, it is. Well... The

08:52.000 --> 08:56.989
best car they've ever made?
Slowest... So, James, er... So you

08:57.000 --> 09:00.989
don't like cars without windscreens?
No, I hate cars without windscreens.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.989
That is the most idiotic idea in the
whole history of motoring, isn't it?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.989
What is the point? What advantage is
there of building a car without a

09:09.000 --> 09:12.989
windscreen? You might as well have a
snorkel mask with no glass in it and

09:13.000 --> 09:17.989
you get hit in the eyeball by fish.
LAUGHTER. ?? new line It's that

09:18.000 --> 09:20.989
idiotic. James, before you have an
aneurysm, there are one or two

09:21.000 --> 09:24.989
points that Hammond and I would like
to make about some of the things you

09:25.000 --> 09:28.989
said in that film. Hammond, do you
want to go first? Yeah, four minutes

09:29.000 --> 09:31.989
and 58 seconds into your film,
whilst referring to acceleration

09:32.000 --> 09:35.989
figures, you say, "they are just
numbers, they're meaningless." They

09:36.000 --> 09:39.989
are. You would say that! James, but
a car that accelerates from 0-60 in

09:40.000 --> 09:43.989
2.8 seconds is better than one that
does it in seven seconds. No, what I

09:44.000 --> 09:46.989
was actually saying... Also, at
three minutes 51, you say and I'm

09:47.000 --> 09:50.989
paraphrasing here, that giving it
more power is like trying to improve

09:51.000 --> 09:55.989
a curry by adding more chillies.
Mmm. That is how you improve a

09:56.000 --> 09:58.989
curry! No, it isn't. It is. Remember
the chicken curry from school, it

09:59.000 --> 10:02.989
was screaming for more spice, it's
what it needed is more. Yes, then

10:03.000 --> 10:08.989
James at five minutes and 29
seconds, you said you were sliding

10:09.000 --> 10:12.989
around like Mika Hakkinen. I was.
Yes, but you see Mika Hakkinen is a

10:13.000 --> 10:16.989
Formula one driver and they don't
slide around. Yeah, but when Mika

10:17.000 --> 10:19.989
Hakkinen took me out for a drive, he
did slide around! Yes, but he's not

10:20.000 --> 10:22.989
known for sliding around. No,
exactly. He might collect porcelain

10:23.000 --> 10:25.989
frogs but you don't go around
saying, "I'm collecting porcelain

10:26.000 --> 10:30.989
frogs like Mika Hakkinen right now."
It's not relevant. Exactly! Have you

10:31.000 --> 10:34.989
quite finished? Well, not really
because there's a lot to go through

10:35.000 --> 10:36.989
but, sadly, we must now find out how
fast these cars go round our track

10:37.000 --> 10:40.989
and that, of course, means
fast these cars go round our track

10:41.000 --> 10:45.989
them over to a man who can actually
drive!

10:46.000 --> 10:50.989
LAUGHTER. ?? new line Some say that
he once put Helen Mirren in a

10:51.000 --> 10:56.989
dishwasher.
LAUGHTER. ?? new line And that at

10:57.000 --> 10:59.989
the Winter Olympics he was
disqualified from the skeleton event

11:00.000 --> 11:01.989
for riding down the hill on an
actual skeleton.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.989
LAUGHTER. ?? new line All we know is
he's called The Stig!

11:07.000 --> 11:12.989
?? WHITE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. ??
new line And they are off. Oo, it's

11:13.000 --> 11:18.989
a bit damp out there, that may slow
them down a bit. 620R building up a

11:19.000 --> 11:21.989
command... Oh, no, there was the
other one coming into shot... At the

11:22.000 --> 11:25.989
last moment. First corner in, the
620R, he's handling that well. No,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.989
still... Yes, we just saw the other
one. And here he is, no music,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.989
obviously, to listen to today. Just
the sound of that two-litre Ford

11:32.000 --> 11:37.989
Duratec engine, supercharged in the
620R. They don't use the 2.3 that

11:38.000 --> 11:42.989
they use and the BAC Mono. Here he
is at the back! Cos it's too tall.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.989
He is actually struggling to get the
power down. But he is getting it

11:49.000 --> 11:53.989
down. Beautifully. Right, Follow
Through next. Here he is, definitely

11:54.000 --> 11:59.989
lifting off. This is a magnificent
example of car control from The

12:00.000 --> 12:04.989
Stig, in one of them at least! The
other one simply not there. Right,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.989
just... Oh, good God, look at that.
Nearly losing it at the exit of the

12:09.000 --> 12:13.989
Follow Through. Handling it nicely
coming through into Gambon. Getting

12:14.000 --> 12:18.989
some opposite lock on before the
corner and across the line!

12:19.000 --> 12:26.989
We just have to wait now for James's
favourite car to finish. "The best

12:27.000 --> 12:32.989
car Caterham have ever made"...
There it goes.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.989
LAUGHTER. ?? new line Any minute
now, it'll be across the line. OK,

12:36.000 --> 12:42.989
talk
is!

12:43.000 --> 12:49.989
AUDIENCE CHEERS.
APPLAUSE. ?? new line Wet lap, so

12:50.000 --> 12:52.989
we're not expecting any records, we
certainly haven't got them. Right

12:53.000 --> 12:57.989
the 620R, the car you didn't much
like. That did it in 1:22.3. Similar

12:58.000 --> 13:05.989
conditions, similar time to the
magnificent Lexus LFA. OK? Now your

13:06.000 --> 13:08.989
favourite car... Not quite so fast.
LAUGHTER.

13:09.000 --> 13:16.989
?? new line There's no other way of
saying this, it was a 1:45.5, so

13:17.000 --> 13:17.989
it's there. It's actually five
seconds slower than Morgan's wooden

13:18.000 --> 13:30.989
tricycle.
?? new line Good. And that's your

13:31.000 --> 13:32.989
favourite car? Of those two, yeah.
LAUGHTER.

13:33.000 --> 13:39.989
?? new line And now the news and the
news is that later on in this

13:40.000 --> 13:42.989
programme Jeremy is going to try and
prove to James and me that cars are

13:43.000 --> 13:45.989
better than bikes. Well, that's
because they are. Well, they're not.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.989
Oh, yes they are. They're warmer
than bikes, they stand up by

13:50.000 --> 13:54.989
themselves. You don't have to wear
rubber trousers. They're faster. Not

13:55.000 --> 13:59.989
faster! They are round corners.
Well, not in a straight line. Yes,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.989
you see, that's what I'm going to
prove later on that they are faster

14:04.000 --> 14:07.989
in a straight line. Really? Yes, I
am. Really? Yes, I am, but now we're

14:08.000 --> 14:11.989
going to do the proper news, OK? Now
you know all around the world there

14:12.000 --> 14:15.989
are museums for all sorts of silly
things. There's a pencil museum in,

14:16.000 --> 14:20.989
is it Cumbria? Yeah, it is. Yeah, a
pencil museum. There's an umbrella

14:21.000 --> 14:25.989
museum in Spain and a museum of the
vagina in Japan. There is a penis

14:26.000 --> 14:29.989
museum in Iceland. Been there. It's
very cold, all the exhibits are very

14:30.000 --> 14:31.989
small. The reason I bring this up is
because, in America there is a

14:32.000 --> 14:32.989
Corvette
because, in America there is a

14:33.000 --> 14:35.989
photograph of it here.
because, in America there is a

14:36.000 --> 14:41.989
America is quite... Heavy.
because, in America there is a

14:42.000 --> 14:45.989
they're bigger gentleman. Big-boned.
Well, one of them visited the museum

14:46.000 --> 14:48.989
this week and this happened.
LAUGHTER.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.989
?? new line Must have been a big
one! That was a big hole. And

14:56.000 --> 14:58.989
apparently, eight cars fell into it.
There's a shot actually looking

14:59.000 --> 15:01.989
down. Look at that. Oh, God, that's
painful to see! Damage was estimated

15:02.000 --> 15:05.989
at $37. Was it? Was it? But
actually, we shouldn't mock because

15:06.000 --> 15:09.989
you know there was a sinkhole, which
is what this is, that opened on the

15:10.000 --> 15:12.989
M2 this week, did you see? On the
central reservation? They closed the

15:13.000 --> 15:16.989
motorway for 18 hours. That, they
kept the museum open. They did!

15:17.000 --> 15:20.989
Well, you can still see the cars.
Yeah, you just... I think we should

15:21.000 --> 15:23.989
applaud the Americans for that
because that's a good attitude to

15:24.000 --> 15:28.989
health and safety. It is. Well done,
you. Oh, now, I tell you what, I've

15:29.000 --> 15:31.989
just remembered something else.
Recently, we were talking about, um,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.989
those motorway gantry signs that
flash up idiotic nannying messages.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.989
There was a sign photographed in
America this week, OK, I think it

15:41.000 --> 15:44.989
was in Texas. There was a light snow
flurry and some wag, and this is

15:45.000 --> 15:49.989
brilliant, posted this. "Oh my God!
Is that snow? We're all gonna die!"

15:50.000 --> 15:54.989
That's more like it! It's just
fabulous. But actually, that is what

15:55.000 --> 15:57.989
we should do. Because that is the
British way. Self-deprecating, make

15:58.000 --> 16:00.989
fun of the situation, have a laugh.
Make fun of the rules and

16:01.000 --> 16:04.989
regulations. I don't know who did
this, but if you're watching and you

16:05.000 --> 16:08.989
ever come to England, I would like
to buy you a beer. I'll put a

16:09.000 --> 16:12.989
strawberry on it for you. Yes. Now,
I've received a letter. May I just

16:13.000 --> 16:15.989
read it to you? "Dear Mr
Clarkson..." You're going to love

16:16.000 --> 16:17.989
this. "I'm writing to you on behalf
of the world-famous Madame

16:18.000 --> 16:24.989
Tussauds." Oh, they're not going
to... Yes, they are! Oh, you're

16:25.000 --> 16:25.989
joking! Oh, no! They say I have been
highly requested, highly requested,

16:26.000 --> 16:32.989
to be immortalised in wax. You sure
that doesn't say immersed in wax?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.989
No, immortalised in wax.
that doesn't say immersed in wax?

16:37.000 --> 16:40.989
they going to immortalise you in
wax? Where are they going to get all

16:41.000 --> 16:43.989
the wax? Presumably they'll have to
melt down everything else in Madame

16:44.000 --> 16:49.989
Tussauds, to make one massive
hideous wax dummy... Of a hideous

16:50.000 --> 16:53.989
dummy. It's easy, they just get a
very big candle, they light it, let

16:54.000 --> 16:57.989
it drip down the edges for a couple
of hours, then just draw a face on

16:58.000 --> 17:01.989
it with felt tip. That would look a
bit like him. What are they going to

17:02.000 --> 17:04.989
do with it when they've got it?
Imagine children, "We're going to

17:05.000 --> 17:07.989
Madame Tussauds! What is that?"
THEY SCREAM.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.989
It's going to be the first waxwork
in history to be sculpted with a

17:12.000 --> 17:14.989
pickaxe. Yes! And a hammer. I want
to see them sculpting it, cos

17:15.000 --> 17:18.989
imagine, once they've melted down
enough wax, which is a lot, the size

17:19.000 --> 17:22.989
of the urn, it'll look like a scene
from Lord Of The Rings! With all

17:23.000 --> 17:25.989
these little orcs walking around the
bottom, getting ready... A big pour,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.989
to create this hideous, hideous,
grotesque, enormous thing! How are

17:30.000 --> 17:31.989
they going to fit it in? No, don't
put it there, put it in the Natural

17:32.000 --> 17:42.989
History Museum.
Next to the big brontosaur! Just a

17:43.000 --> 17:44.989
big skeleton. Just a big skeleton
next to the brontosaur, a big

17:45.000 --> 17:48.989
tyrannosaurus-
what-the-hell-is-that? And then

17:49.000 --> 17:52.989
people can go and watch. Ladies and
gentlemen, the sound of bitterness

17:53.000 --> 17:57.989
and jealousy. My colleagues, there.
I wish I hadn't brought that up. As

17:58.000 --> 18:00.989
you probably noticed last week, a
Danish supercar called the Zenvo

18:01.000 --> 18:04.989
came down here and caught fire. A
lot of people were very shocked by

18:05.000 --> 18:07.989
that but actually, it's not unusual
for expensive cars to catch fire

18:08.000 --> 18:10.989
when they're first released. Ferrari
had a problem with the 458. And then

18:11.000 --> 18:14.989
just this week, we've been hearing
about Porsche GT3 problems. There's

18:15.000 --> 18:19.989
a shot here of one in... Of one in
Switzerland. The internet is awash

18:20.000 --> 18:23.989
with rumours of other examples of
this. Porsche themselves admit it

18:24.000 --> 18:25.989
has happened in Italy as well. And
have now suspended deliveries of the

18:26.000 --> 18:31.989
new GT3 to customers.
have now suspended deliveries of the

18:32.000 --> 18:33.989
if you'd already taken delivery of
your brand- new... Your brand-new

18:34.000 --> 18:38.989
and expensive
your brand- new... Your brand-new

18:39.000 --> 18:42.989
fire at any moment? Well, we really
need to ask a customer, don't we,

18:43.000 --> 18:47.989
who's just done that? Hammond! What?
You've just had a GT3 delivered,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.989
haven't you? Yes!
HE LAUGHS.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.989
Shut up, stop talking about it.
Thank you, move on. It must be so

18:58.000 --> 19:00.989
depressing. Oh, God. Yes, it is. To
have worked so hard to buy your

19:01.000 --> 19:04.989
dream car that is then immediately
valueless. Oh, God! So to try and

19:05.000 --> 19:08.989
cheer you up, Hammond, I've bought
you a small present. Oh, have you?

19:09.000 --> 19:12.989
Thank you, I love your gifts. We
don't often buy each other presents

19:13.000 --> 19:18.989
on this show but I've done just that
today. Mono... They're actually GT3

19:19.000 --> 19:27.989
branded driving gloves. Oven gloves.
Thank you. Funny. Ha-ha-ha-ha(!)

19:28.000 --> 19:32.989
And... Doesn't just stop there. Oh,
please let it stop. I think we need

19:33.000 --> 19:36.989
to coat your car in the most fire
retardant material known to man.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.989
Pizzas. Oh, not your pizza theory!
It's one of his stupid theories.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.989
Come on, Hammond, come with me.
Really? Now, this is your actual

19:45.000 --> 19:48.989
GT3. Yes, it is, actually, yes. We
know this because there's a fireman

19:49.000 --> 19:50.989
standing next to it with an
extinguisher in case it suddenly

19:51.000 --> 19:54.989
combusts. Good! Now, what I'm
planning on doing, OK, is I'm going

19:55.000 --> 19:59.989
to take these pizzas, pop them on
the car. And then apply a blowtorch.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.989
No! No, you're not, no, you're not!
I've seen you do this and you're not

20:05.000 --> 20:08.989
doing it to my car. No. But the
ladies and gentlemen want to see if

20:09.000 --> 20:14.989
pizza is... I don't care! Not to my
car! No. Can we attach them to you?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.989
Well, if you must, yes. Right, well,
first of all, we need to

20:18.000 --> 20:21.989
establish... James, can I borrow
you? Yes. First of all we need to

20:22.000 --> 20:24.989
establish that these are pizzas, OK?
Have a look. You will see there's no

20:25.000 --> 20:29.989
asbestos in there, they're real
pizzas. Yes? Yeah.

20:30.000 --> 20:29.989
asbestos in there, they're real
you'd like to just take a bite? Yes,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.989
let me just pull a piece off.
you'd like to just take a bite? Yes,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.989
that a pizza? Tastes like the
cardboard box it came in, so it must

20:38.000 --> 20:40.989
be. There you go. So those are the
pizzas. If you'd like to attach

20:41.000 --> 20:45.989
those to Hammond, that would be
tremendous. To his face? Um... His

20:46.000 --> 20:53.989
vegetables. OK. Oh, really? Come on!
Oh, not... That's ambitious, mate.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.989
That's by my knees! Now, I'm going
to fire up the blowtorch. There we

20:58.000 --> 21:01.989
go. Oh, God, come on, no! This is
ridiculous! James, how hot is the

21:02.000 --> 21:05.989
tip of this flame? Probably the best
part of 800 degrees C. Enough to

21:06.000 --> 21:08.989
melt aluminium. Enough to melt
aluminium. This is a real blowtorch.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.989
Look, I can demonstrate it. Fire on
there, you can actually see it

21:15.000 --> 21:17.989
burning the table nicely. Oh! This
is a real, well, two layers of

21:18.000 --> 21:24.989
pizza, and a real Richard Hammond.
Everybody ready? CROWD: Yes!

21:25.000 --> 21:29.989
Wouldn't do it to him.
AUDIENCE GROANS.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.989
Oh, yes, I would!
AUDIENCE CHEERS.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.989
Oh, no!
HE YELLS. ?? new line Jeremy, that's

21:40.000 --> 21:44.989
quite a long time, isn't it? Not
really. Stop it! I can smell burning

21:45.000 --> 21:49.989
sausage. Is that alarming? Can you
see? Pizza. Pop it on your car. No!

21:50.000 --> 21:55.989
Ladies and gentlemen, Hammond is
still here.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.989
APPLAUSE. ?? new line Stupid,
stupid. That is... I think that is a

22:02.000 --> 22:04.989
Top Gear hot tip. We're going to
move on. Because, you see, in the

22:05.000 --> 22:10.989
olden days, when James was 43, car
makers would sell you a complete car

22:11.000 --> 22:16.989
like they do now. Or they would sell
you something like this - an engine,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.989
a chassis, and some suspension. And
then you would take this to a coach

22:21.000 --> 22:22.989
building company who would then fit
a personalised body, personalised

22:23.000 --> 22:27.989
interior, you could have anything
you wanted. And in the '30s, this

22:28.000 --> 22:28.989
interior, you could have anything
meant there were some truly amazing

22:29.000 --> 22:39.989
creations.
Back then, there were coach building

22:40.000 --> 22:45.989
companies all over the world,
helping the wealthy to fulfil their

22:46.000 --> 22:51.989
wildest dreams. Anything was
possible, and everything was done.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.989
Coach building meant that Clark
Gable didn't have to have a car that

22:57.000 --> 23:04.989
looked like this. It meant he could
have one that looked like this.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.989
Today, though, cars are built
differently. You don't get a chassis

23:12.000 --> 23:15.989
with a body on the top. Because the
body sort of is the chassis. The

23:16.000 --> 23:20.989
pillars, the roof, the doorframes,
they're all load-bearing, so

23:21.000 --> 23:24.989
changing anything is a nightmare.
And this has meant that for many

23:25.000 --> 23:27.989
years, coach building has been a
lost art. Now, though, I'm delighted

23:28.000 --> 23:39.989
to say... It's back.
Welcome, everyone, to the Alfa Romeo

23:40.000 --> 23:51.989
Disco Volante.
One of the most striking,

23:52.000 --> 24:01.989
intelligent, and unusual cars I've
seen in a very long time.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.989
It started out in life as an Alfa
Romeo 8C. But was totally re-bodied

24:09.000 --> 24:09.989
and re-upholstered by an old coach
building company in Milan called

24:10.000 --> 24:21.989
Touring.
In the '50s, they styled and built

24:22.000 --> 24:30.989
sports
In the '50s, they styled and built

24:31.000 --> 24:38.989
they designed the Aston Martin DB5
and DB6. Along with the Jensen

24:39.000 --> 24:44.989
Interceptor, and the very first
Lamborghini - the 350GT.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.989
That is quite a CV. In recent years,
however, they've been reduced to

24:52.000 --> 24:56.989
making mildly modified Bentleys and
Maseratis. It's been like watching

24:57.000 --> 25:03.989
Dame Judi Dench reduced to appearing
in a regional pantomime.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.989
But now, they've decided to bring
the lost art of proper coach

25:08.000 --> 25:14.989
building back, with the Disco
Volante.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.989
Certain structural and safety
related things can't be changed. The

25:21.000 --> 25:23.989
seat belt mounting points, the
windscreen, the suspension mounting

25:24.000 --> 25:26.989
points, they'll be the same on this
car as they are on this one. It's

25:27.000 --> 25:31.989
like plastic surgery. You can't
change the skeleton, but you can

25:32.000 --> 25:40.989
change the flesh. And that is what
they've done. But has it worked?

25:41.000 --> 25:48.989
The simple answer is, yes. It
doesn't shake, it doesn't rattle. It

25:49.000 --> 25:54.989
doesn't feel like botched plastic
surgery. You don't think every time

25:55.000 --> 25:56.989
you go over a bump, "Oh no, my nose
is going to fall off." Doesn't feel

25:57.000 --> 26:07.989
like Michael Jackson.
Do you know what it does feel? It

26:08.000 --> 26:09.989
feels... Solid. It feels, and this
is high praise for a hand-built car,

26:10.000 --> 26:15.989
it feels... Mass-produced.
That said, it does not feel like the

26:16.000 --> 26:28.989
car that spawned it. It
That's because they've softened the

26:29.000 --> 26:31.989
suspension, they've turned it from a
stiff, B-road barnstormer into a

26:32.000 --> 26:37.989
comfortable cruising machine, and I
like that.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.989
There are loads of cars built
specifically to attack a road like

26:46.000 --> 26:51.989
this. So it's quite refreshing to
find one that allows you to savour

26:52.000 --> 26:57.989
it. Savour the views, savour the
moment. So, it doesn't feel like an

26:58.000 --> 27:09.989
8C.
And it certainly doesn't sound like

27:10.000 --> 27:15.989
one either. Oh, it's the most...
..soulful-sounding car I think I've

27:16.000 --> 27:17.989
ever heard. It's as though the
entire exhaust system is actually

27:18.000 --> 27:36.989
made out of Otis Redding.
# Left my home in Georgia... # ROARS

27:37.000 --> 27:41.989
IN TUNE WITH ENGINE.
GIGGLES. ?? new line # Heading for

27:42.000 --> 27:45.989
the Frisco Bay... # IMITATES
ACCELERATING ENGINE.

27:46.000 --> 27:55.989
GROWL It's Otis! Don't get me wrong,
though. This is not a slow car. It

27:56.000 --> 28:03.989
has a 444 horsepower 4.7 litre
Maserati V8.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.989
Couple that to a super-light carbon
fibre and aluminium body, and you

28:09.000 --> 28:18.989
end up with a car that accelerates
like it's fallen off a cliff.

28:19.000 --> 28:27.989
The top speed is 181. Thing is,
though, driving a car this

28:28.000 --> 28:35.989
exquisite, this elegant, quickly,
feels wrong. It would be like pogo

28:36.000 --> 28:39.989
dancing to I Heard It Through The
Grapevine. No, no, no, you can't do

28:40.000 --> 28:50.989
that!
This, this kind of speed, this is

28:51.000 --> 28:56.989
where it's at its best. Half speed.
I don't even feel inclined to drive

28:57.000 --> 29:02.989
it fast. I don't want to hang the
tail out on the hairpins. Just want

29:03.000 --> 29:06.989
to put it in auto, put some tunes on
the stereo, like so. Pop on a pair

29:07.000 --> 29:25.989
of sunglasses... And slow on down.
And pretty soon, you'll want to stop

29:26.000 --> 29:27.989
altogether and get out. Because
looking at this car, that's really

29:28.000 --> 29:38.989
what it's all about.
It's interesting how many elements

29:39.000 --> 29:42.989
from other things are in that shape.
I can see a little bit of Corvette,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.989
a bit of E-Type... Then there's the,
um...I think it was called the

29:48.000 --> 29:53.989
Discovery, the spaceship in 2001: A
Space Odyssey. I see that at the

29:54.000 --> 29:57.989
front. And I love the way they paint
it gold before they paint it red to

29:58.000 --> 30:01.989
make the colour richer. Then there's
the name - "Disco Volante" - picked

30:02.000 --> 30:05.989
out in the seats. I know, in
Italian, Disco Volante means "flying

30:06.000 --> 30:06.989
saucer" but to me, it's the name of
Largo's hydrofoil in the Bond film

30:07.000 --> 30:29.989
Thunderball.
I think it really is time now to

30:30.000 --> 30:34.989
bring out my special, "in love"
face.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.989
I was jealous of Hammond when he
came out to Italy the other day to

30:41.000 --> 30:46.989
drive the new Alfa 4C, because, to
me, that thing is special.

30:47.000 --> 30:47.989
It's...it's the Angel Gabriel. But
I'm not jealous any more, because

30:48.000 --> 30:58.989
this... This is the full baby Jesus.
I'm not going to say it's the best

30:59.000 --> 31:01.989
car in the world - it certainly
isn't the nicest to drive, the

31:02.000 --> 31:06.989
brakes are spongy, you can see
nothing out of the back. But as a

31:07.000 --> 31:09.989
tool for making feel special,
really, nothing gets close. Nothing

31:10.000 --> 31:17.989
at all.
A Maserati heart, an Alfa Romeo

31:18.000 --> 31:28.989
badge, exhausts made out of Otis
Redding... ..and a hand-crafted body

31:29.000 --> 31:38.989
to die for. That is one hell of a
combination. It really is.

31:39.000 --> 31:56.989
?? new line No, no, no, no, no. No,
don't... Sorry. What? Hang on. You

31:57.000 --> 32:00.989
were having a go at me earlier on
because I preferred the slow

32:01.000 --> 32:03.989
Caterham to the fast one. Mm-hm. And
here you are, raving about a car

32:04.000 --> 32:07.989
that's happiest at half-speed? Well,
yes. You're an utter hypocrite. No,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.989
no - you see, the thing is, I'd
prefer to drive to somebody's house

32:12.000 --> 32:17.989
in a Lexus LFA, cos I like the power
from that screaming V10 engine. But

32:18.000 --> 32:21.989
in a Lexus LFA, cos I like the power
beautiful, it's handcrafted...

32:22.000 --> 32:26.989
in a Lexus LFA, cos I like the power
much is it? Uh... Well, do you know,

32:27.000 --> 32:30.989
they won't tell me, even when I
lightly tortured them. But I have

32:31.000 --> 32:34.989
heard there's a man in Singapore
paid ?1.5 million for his. Now,

32:35.000 --> 32:38.989
there are a lot of import taxes in
Singapore - I mean, huge ones. Even

32:39.000 --> 32:43.989
so, that's about 130... That's still
?600,000 for the car. Yes, I know.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.989
And what's amazing is that, in
Singapore, you're not allowed to

32:47.000 --> 32:51.989
drive a left-hand drive car on the
road. So he's paid ?1.5 million for

32:52.000 --> 32:56.989
a car he can't drive.
LAUGHTER. ?? new line He's

32:57.000 --> 32:59.989
completely mad. He isn't -
somebody's just paid, what, ?42

33:00.000 --> 33:03.989
million for a Francis Bacon
painting. You can't drive that,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.989
either. It's not a car. James, I
haven't got time for your pedantry.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.989
Because we have to now put a Star in
our Reasonably Priced Car. Now, my

33:12.000 --> 33:17.989
guest tonight is extremely funny,
but he can't drive. So he is the

33:18.000 --> 33:20.989
exact opposite of Nigel Mansell.
LAUGHTER.

33:21.000 --> 33:29.989
?? new line Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Whitehall.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.989
APPLAUSE. ?? new line How are you?
Good, how are you? Look who's here!

33:35.000 --> 33:39.989
Hello. Hey. Have a seat. Oh...
Ooh... Do you know, I haven't seen

33:40.000 --> 33:43.989
you since you were in short
trousers. Yes, well, I mean, you

33:44.000 --> 33:46.989
know... You were a big part of my
childhood. And that's not something

33:47.000 --> 33:51.989
that probably everyone in here
knows. Jeremy was a father at the

33:52.000 --> 33:57.989
prep school that I went to and I
have a lot of very vivid... This is

33:58.000 --> 34:02.989
a big moment for me, being here,
with you, cos... With long trousers.

34:03.000 --> 34:11.989
With long trousers on - tight, long
trousers. But you were, like, the

34:12.000 --> 34:14.989
first kind of... Real, kind of,
silverback alpha male I'd ever set

34:15.000 --> 34:18.989
eyes on. Every other father at the
school that I went to was, like, a

34:19.000 --> 34:21.989
blubbering-faced posh toff with a
Barbour jacket. Then you came

34:22.000 --> 34:25.989
striding across the sports field, a
vision in denim, like... It was

34:26.000 --> 34:29.989
amazing - we were all like, "Oh,
God, look at him! "He probably eats

34:30.000 --> 34:31.989
his steak rare "and doesn't bother
getting out of the bath to take a

34:32.000 --> 34:36.989
BLEEP.
" LAUGHTER.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.989
?? new line. And here you are. It
was always those book signings -

34:41.000 --> 34:44.989
that's... You had to go, all the
parents had to go, if they'd written

34:45.000 --> 34:48.989
a book - and almost everyone at this
school had... Yeah. You'd be in this

34:49.000 --> 34:52.989
room and there'd be Jeremy Paxman
with a big stack of books he was

34:53.000 --> 34:56.989
trying to sell. It was you and
Paxman... I remember it like it was

34:57.000 --> 35:00.989
yesterday. There was one room, it
was a science lab. You were at one

35:01.000 --> 35:04.989
end and Paxman was at the other. And
it was basically who's got the

35:05.000 --> 35:06.989
biggest dick competition. He'd have
some really acerbic, intelligent

35:07.000 --> 35:09.989
book he'd written about the
Reformation, then you'd have, you

35:10.000 --> 35:13.989
know... "Full Throttle", or whatever
it was. It was. It was. He'd got a

35:14.000 --> 35:15.989
queue of people going, you know,
"Your observations on the

35:16.000 --> 35:20.989
Plantagenets are most interesting."
And I got, "Do you think the Subaru

35:21.000 --> 35:24.989
is better than the Evo?" Now... We
get many guests down here who say,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.989
"Ooh, no, I can't drive." And they
mean, "I've never done any track

35:28.000 --> 35:31.989
driving "and I'm not very confident
and I'm not very good." When we say

35:32.000 --> 35:35.989
you can't drive, we mean... You
CAN'T drive. No. No, I can't drive

35:36.000 --> 35:39.989
at all. I... I mean, I've been in a
car once, behind the wheel. I've

35:40.000 --> 35:42.989
done passenger stuff loads of times,
I'm amazing. But the driving aspect,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.989
I've done, like, half a lesson? My
dad gave me half a lesson and it

35:47.000 --> 35:50.989
became clear that it wasn't really a
lesson - he wanted a lift to the

35:51.000 --> 35:55.989
butchers. So we drove down the road
to the left, he picked up a leg of

35:56.000 --> 35:59.989
lamb and we went home. So that's the
only lesson I ever had. But I've

36:00.000 --> 36:03.989
never been behind the wheel of a car
on my own ever before. So I thought

36:04.000 --> 36:07.989
it would be good to come and do
it... Here? Which, of course, meant

36:08.000 --> 36:11.989
that we actually had to teach you to
drive a car. Yeah. When I say,

36:12.000 --> 36:15.989
"we"...The Stig. Yeah, I mean, he
wasn't... He's

36:16.000 --> 36:15.989
"we"...The Stig. Yeah, I mean, he
let's put it that way. Um... Well,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.989
we've actually got some footage
let's put it that way. Um... Well,

36:19.000 --> 36:22.989
Jack's first ever driving lesson in
an actual... Was it a manual? I

36:23.000 --> 36:26.989
mean, did it have, like, a lever
coming out there? It had a pull-y

36:27.000 --> 36:30.989
thing and then three pedals. Three
pedals and a pull-y thing. This is

36:31.000 --> 36:33.989
known as a manual car. A manual car,
yes. Anybody like to see Jack's

36:34.000 --> 36:36.989
first ever driving lesson?
AUDIENCE: ?? GREEN Yes!

36:37.000 --> 36:42.989
Never, ever done this before. Here
we go, let's have a look. It should

36:43.000 --> 36:51.989
make a "vroom" noise, shouldn't it?
Do I... Am I turning it the right

36:52.000 --> 36:54.989
way? No? Right, OK, fine. 'Was he
completely uncommunicative?' He

36:55.000 --> 36:56.989
didn't even nod.
ENGINE REVS.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.989
Yes!
ENGINE STALLS.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.989
Stig, I might need a little bit more
from you than this. OK, right, so

37:08.000 --> 37:10.989
that's not working. By process of
elimination, if we come off the

37:11.000 --> 37:17.989
clutch and press this...
ENGINE REVS.

37:18.000 --> 37:25.989
Yeah, that's revving. Getting ready.
And your handbrake's on. That sounds

37:26.000 --> 37:30.989
good. No, it doesn't. OK, this is
getting better. Oh, Jesus...

37:31.000 --> 37:35.989
APPLAUSE. ?? new line I mean, well
done. But we had to go from that to

37:36.000 --> 37:39.989
getting you round a lap in the space
of an hour. I think my priorities

37:40.000 --> 37:42.989
were... He didn't think that I was
taking it seriously, cos when I

37:43.000 --> 37:47.989
first got in the car - a perfectly
valid thing, it's the thing I always

37:48.000 --> 37:51.989
ask when I get in a car, is whether
he had an iPhone charger. Because

37:52.000 --> 37:54.989
mine had died and I wanted to get
some photos of the journey and he

37:55.000 --> 37:58.989
wasn't happy about that. He's so
moody! I asked him if there was a

37:59.000 --> 38:02.989
Mrs Stig and that didn't go down
well. No, it wouldn't. That's what

38:03.000 --> 38:08.989
he needs - maybe he's not getting
enough of it at home. I thought of

38:09.000 --> 38:14.989
the perfect person for The Stig as
well - match made in Heaven - him

38:15.000 --> 38:15.989
demonstrations on The Cube. With the
mask.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.989
LAUGHTER. They would be perfect
together!

38:22.000 --> 38:25.989
APPLAUSE. What would the babies be
like? The babies would be amazing!

38:26.000 --> 38:29.989
You could do it as a challenge -
send them to the Isle of Fernandos!

38:30.000 --> 38:33.989
Talking of The Stig not getting
enough, how, if you're a 17-year-old

38:34.000 --> 38:37.989
youth, do you get any... At all from
girls if you can't drive them

38:38.000 --> 38:41.989
anywhere? Yeah, it was hard.
Especially when I became a stand-up

38:42.000 --> 38:43.989
and it was like, stand-up, you're
going around on tours, quite

38:44.000 --> 38:47.989
rock'n'roll, there would be groupies
and stuff, but it's very hard to

38:48.000 --> 38:51.989
pull a groupie when your mother has
driven you to the gig. Afterwards,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.989
you'd be like, "Yeah, you want to go
back to my crib? "My ride's outside,

38:55.000 --> 38:59.989
it's the Volvo just there. "You'll
have to sit in the back, cos I ride

39:00.000 --> 39:02.989
up front with Mummy. "Hope you like
The Archers!" So when you're doing

39:03.000 --> 39:06.989
your gigs now, presumably your mum
doesn't take you around. No - the

39:07.000 --> 39:10.989
best thing about this latest tour,
it's the biggest one I've done, and

39:11.000 --> 39:14.989
I'm going to be in a tour bus, which
is amazing. Cos the worst thing, I

39:15.000 --> 39:18.989
find, about doing a tour when you're
in a car is having to use petrol

39:19.000 --> 39:21.989
station toilets, cos the lock on a
petrol station toilet door is always

39:22.000 --> 39:25.989
broken. They're always bust, then
you have to do that thing which we

39:26.000 --> 39:29.989
all do, which I call "lavatory yoga"
where you work out how to keep the

39:30.000 --> 39:33.989
door with a broken lock shut. Yeah.
There's three main schools of it -

39:34.000 --> 39:37.989
you've got the Tom Daley, where you
lean forward with the arms like

39:38.000 --> 39:41.989
that. Use the fingertips. Yeah. But
I can't BLEEP unless I'm playing

39:42.000 --> 39:44.989
Candy Crush, so that doesn't work.
Then you've got the Bowing Monk,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.989
where you put your head forward and
just use it as a doorstop. But

39:49.000 --> 39:51.989
someone can, like, knock you out if
they're too insistent on getting in.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.989
Then your third option, which is the
best one, which you should always

39:56.000 --> 39:59.989
use, is the Woman In Labour, where
you plant two feet onto the door.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.989
But I committed to this recently in
a petrol station just outside of

40:03.000 --> 40:04.989
Bolton, and I'd fully committed, but
you have to be a master of your

40:05.000 --> 40:14.989
surroundings,
you have to be a master of your

40:15.000 --> 40:17.989
door in question opened both ways!
This, like, hairy trucker ripped it

40:18.000 --> 40:21.989
off and literally thought I was kind
of presenting myself to him!

40:22.000 --> 40:25.989
"Hello!" Now, I want to just go on
to... Are you playing the O2? I'm

40:26.000 --> 40:32.989
playing the O2 on the... Oh, I've
forgotten the date!

40:33.000 --> 40:37.989
LAUGHTER. Come on. 17th March. 17th
March? The 17th or 18th March. Like,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.989
roughly. 17th, he's coming, he's got
a ticket. The 17th! Oh, no, he works

40:42.000 --> 40:44.989
here. And there we are, so... It's
not just going to be a tour, there's

40:45.000 --> 40:48.989
plenty of surprises as well. There
will be the greatest ever Segway

40:49.000 --> 40:51.989
entrance to a stand-up tour the
world has ever seen. Somebody's

40:52.000 --> 40:54.989
putting you on a Segway? I'm on a
Segway, yeah. Well, that's worth

40:55.000 --> 40:58.989
going to see. It's got everything
you'd want from a stand-up comedy

40:59.000 --> 41:01.989
tour. Anyway, the lap. I ought to
explain, you did actually ditch the

41:02.000 --> 41:05.989
manual, didn't you, for the lap and
go to an automatic? Yeah, I thought

41:06.000 --> 41:09.989
that was best cos I wanted to get
all the way around it. The only

41:10.000 --> 41:12.989
trouble with an automatic is you're
not going to... You'll probably not

41:13.000 --> 41:16.989
get very high up that anyway, so...
Let's not worry too much about that.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.989
Who here would like to see the
result of your driving lesson?

41:20.000 --> 41:24.989
AUDIENCE: Yeah! Here we go. Oh,
dear. Flying solo for the first

41:25.000 --> 41:28.989
time. Come on, Jack. You are a king
of speed! We shall see, you look a

41:29.000 --> 41:34.989
bit frightened. I was very
frightened. You've steered round

41:35.000 --> 41:39.989
that one. It sounds awful. Oh, good
God! And off. That counts though,

41:40.000 --> 41:45.989
doesn't it? Yes, yes, yes, you're
still... To be honest, a lot of what

41:46.000 --> 41:51.989
The Stig says is BLEEP! It's really
just about... Oh!

41:52.000 --> 41:55.989
JEREMY LAUGHS. I guess we'll never
know, as we do Chicago, heading down

41:56.000 --> 41:58.989
to the Hammerhead. Where are you
going? That's completely the

41:59.000 --> 42:02.989
wrong... Oh, I feel so sick. You
made yourself sick! I made myself

42:03.000 --> 42:05.989
sick. And here we go, round the
Hammerhead... Whoops!

42:06.000 --> 42:10.989
sick. And here we go, round the
good. Not really...

42:11.000 --> 42:16.989
circular thing is necessary there in
front of you. Is it low on petrol?

42:17.000 --> 42:25.989
Cos it kept beeping. Right, so, it
was beeping at you? Don't go off

42:26.000 --> 42:28.989
there! Tyres. This one was good. Oh,
braking there! That's ballsy because

42:29.000 --> 42:31.989
that can upset the rear end in a
front-wheel-drive car and I may be

42:32.000 --> 42:35.989
talking French as far as you're
concerned there. Only Gambon to go

42:36.000 --> 42:38.989
and can you do it? Oh, wait a
minute, yes, nearly, you can! Across

42:39.000 --> 42:48.989
the line!
CHEERING. I got there. When you bear

42:49.000 --> 42:52.989
in mind that you arrived this
morning having driven a car once to

42:53.000 --> 42:56.989
the butchers and back... Yeah. And
then you had a lesson and then put

42:57.000 --> 43:00.989
that together, I think that's pretty
impressive, I really do. Oh, thank

43:01.000 --> 43:05.989
you. But how fast do you think you
did it? Where do you think you came

43:06.000 --> 43:10.989
on the board? Oh, I don't know. In
between Hiddleston and Bonneville?

43:11.000 --> 43:15.989
You're hoping to get between Tom and
Hugh? Around about the 1.50 mark?

43:16.000 --> 43:19.989
Yeah. You did it, Jack Whitehall...
You're leaning forward like a pro...

43:20.000 --> 43:32.989
One minute... One minute, that's
good. ..50... There's no kind way of

43:33.000 --> 43:42.989
saying this. ..4.5.
AUDIENCE GROANS. It's all right, you

43:43.000 --> 43:46.989
know... Getting in the car for me
was a victory in itself. Do you want

43:47.000 --> 43:50.989
to move it further down? I feel like
I'm sullying that person by being

43:51.000 --> 43:54.989
there. But that, I mean... Maybe I
could come back after I've actually

43:55.000 --> 43:56.989
learnt to drive and I would get a
competitive time. I'd like that

43:57.000 --> 44:01.989
because this was woeful. Yeah, I
know! At least I'm on the board and

44:02.000 --> 44:04.989
not at home crying in my pants,
which is

44:05.000 --> 44:05.989
not at home crying in my pants,
comes to driving. No, I'd like to

44:06.000 --> 44:09.989
have you back because it's
comes to driving. No, I'd like to

44:10.000 --> 44:17.989
Ladies and gentlemen, Jack
Whitehall!

44:18.000 --> 44:25.989
Now... If you want a car that's
fast, you're spoiled for choice.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.989
Same story if you want a car that's
economical or cheap, or has a big

44:29.000 --> 44:32.989
boot, but what if you're a massive
show-off and your main requirement

44:33.000 --> 44:38.989
is for a car that makes you stand
out in your hometown? Well, that can

44:39.000 --> 44:40.989
be a lot trickier depending upon the
town where you live, as I shall now

44:41.000 --> 44:55.989
demonstrate.
Welcome to the United Arab Emirates,

44:56.000 --> 44:57.989
where, as you can see, it takes
quite a lot to stand out on the car

44:58.000 --> 45:06.989
front.
Out here, your common or garden

45:07.000 --> 45:13.989
Ferrari or Lamborghini can no longer
cut the mustard. So what do you do

45:14.000 --> 45:16.989
if you want to turn heads? Well, I
think I may have the answer.

45:17.000 --> 45:26.989
ENGINE REVS.
You see, everyone thinks about

45:27.000 --> 45:32.989
blinging their wheels, but nobody
ever thinks of adding MORE wheels.

45:33.000 --> 45:41.989
This is the new six-wheeled version
of Mercedes's iconic G-Wagen. And

45:42.000 --> 45:48.989
beside the extra wheels, it also
ticks the rarity box because it's

45:49.000 --> 45:51.989
one of only two in existence. More
will be built, though I suspect not

45:52.000 --> 45:52.989
many when you consider the price,
which is a trouser-troubling

45:53.000 --> 46:04.989
?370,000.
The six-wheel G-Class was originally

46:05.000 --> 46:11.989
built for the Australian Army, who
demanded standard equipment like

46:12.000 --> 46:14.989
seats and doors. In this civilian
version, however, you get heated and

46:15.000 --> 46:15.989
ventilated electric leather chairs,
a leather-trimmed dashboard and a

46:16.000 --> 46:28.989
bamboo-lined cargo bay.
You really do get a lot of car for

46:29.000 --> 46:33.989
your money, as in A LOT OF CAR. I
mean, look at it. It's nearly a

46:34.000 --> 46:38.989
metre longer than a Range Rover and
it's got 37-inch wheels. I reckon I

46:39.000 --> 46:47.989
could get my head in the gap between
the wheel and the wheel arch. Yeah,

46:48.000 --> 46:49.989
I can. Try doing that in a Range
Rover.

46:50.000 --> 46:56.989
ENGINE REVS. The six-by-six also
weighs three-and-three-quarter

46:57.000 --> 47:03.989
tonnes or the same as three VW
Golfs. So, engine-wise, it can't

47:04.000 --> 47:06.989
afford to mess about. It's actually
got a 5.5 litre, 536-horsepower

47:07.000 --> 47:15.989
twin-turbo V8 from Mercedes's
in-house nutterists, AMG.

47:16.000 --> 47:24.989
Oh, we're getting a move on! 560
pound-feet of torque. 0-60 in under

47:25.000 --> 47:34.989
six seconds.
That's sports car stuff in something

47:35.000 --> 47:39.989
the size of a shopping centre. Fuel
economy? Well, I doubt this will be

47:40.000 --> 47:44.989
the official transport to the next
Greenpeace annual conference. All

47:45.000 --> 47:48.989
I'll say is they thought it best to
fit two fuel tanks. You change over

47:49.000 --> 47:53.989
using this switch up here. And
everybody loves an overhead switch.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.989
If I drove this down Ross-on- Wye
high street, I would be lord of all

47:56.000 --> 48:03.989
I survey.
high street, I would be lord of all

48:04.000 --> 48:12.989
Herefordshire, this thing attracts
attention even around here.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.989
SIREN WAILS. Seriously? Really?
'Yeah, he's serious. 'As it turned

48:18.000 --> 48:22.989
out, 'the policeman had never seen
such an unusual car before...'

48:23.000 --> 48:27.989
There's six wheels. I guess it's the
same on the other side. '..and was

48:28.000 --> 48:34.989
on his way again after he'd had a
look.' Bye! Lamborghini Aventador

48:35.000 --> 48:44.989
police car. They don't have those in
Ross- on-Wye. Or these... Ferrari

48:45.000 --> 48:48.989
FF. That's an S... MG. What a funny
day.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.989
Now, although the six-by-six is
seriously quick on tarmac and turns

48:53.000 --> 49:00.989
policemen's heads, where it's really
built to shine is as an off- roader.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.989
Let me give you an example. A Land
Rover Defender can wade through half

49:07.000 --> 49:13.989
a metre of water and that's very
good. This can wade through twice

49:14.000 --> 49:17.989
that. However, this being the
desert, water is quite hard to find,

49:18.000 --> 49:34.989
so if you want to test it, you do
have to improvise.

49:35.000 --> 49:47.989
Morning, sorry. Sorry. This is,
unless I'm very much mistaken, a

49:48.000 --> 49:54.989
metre of water. And my six-by-six
is... Wading through it. Even

49:55.000 --> 50:00.989
dealing with the rubber rings. Yeah,
not having any difficulties

50:01.000 --> 50:06.989
this at all. But how does it cope
with sand? Well, the good news is,

50:07.000 --> 50:13.989
sand is one thing we're really not
short of. Welcome to the Empty

50:14.000 --> 50:21.989
Quarter. The largest sand desert in
the world. Covering some 250,000

50:22.000 --> 50:22.989
square miles. Out here, temperatures
hit 50 degrees centigrade and there

50:23.000 --> 50:43.989
are dunes more than 800ft high.
OK, we have six-wheel drive with the

50:44.000 --> 50:47.989
power split 30-40-30 across the
axles... Check. Stronger front

50:48.000 --> 50:53.989
springs from the armoured version of
the G- Class... Check. Locking diffs

50:54.000 --> 50:57.989
- oh, we've got those. The most
you'd expect normally would be

50:58.000 --> 50:58.989
three. On here, five! And you lock
them using these buttons in

50:59.000 --> 51:14.989
different ways. Right, let's go.
These are big, big dunes. This is

51:15.000 --> 51:19.989
more of a sand mountain I'm on right
now.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.989
Oh! Three-and-three-quarter tonnes
of Mercedes is doing this, it just

51:24.000 --> 51:45.989
doesn't feel right!
This extra axle and these two extra

51:46.000 --> 51:49.989
wheels, it changes the way the
six-by-six travels over the ground,

51:50.000 --> 51:50.989
it undulates, it feels supple. It's
like blasting through the desert

51:51.000 --> 51:56.989
dunes... ..riding a sinew.
Come on! O-o-o-oh! No! BLEEP! I got

51:57.000 --> 52:17.989
some air. Sorry, everybody.
'Intoxicated by what the Merc could

52:18.000 --> 52:18.989
do, 'I drove deeper and deeper into
the Empty Quarter.' Right, where's

52:19.000 --> 52:23.989
it go now?
Oh, for crying out loud! I wouldn't

52:24.000 --> 52:55.989
ski down that! OK.
Whoa-oh-oh-aah! Over the top, over

52:56.000 --> 53:00.989
the top... Oh! Oh, very unpleasant,
not nice!

53:01.000 --> 53:09.989
It's vertical! I'm in a car, I'm
having a plane crash! I'm still

53:10.000 --> 53:28.989
going down!
Ahead, I saw a nice, flat desert

53:29.000 --> 53:32.989
floor 'and decided that was a much
safer place to be.' HE LAUGHS.

53:33.000 --> 53:43.989
It's drifting! Now it's a rally car,
a gigantic rally car.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.989
And let's not forget, I'm not having
to shout over this, it's not

53:50.000 --> 53:53.989
"Raaargh!" In here. I'm still
cocooned in luxury. It's an amazing

53:54.000 --> 54:02.989
device.
Now, when you take an off- roader

54:03.000 --> 54:07.989
across sand, the standard practice,
as I've done, is to let some air out

54:08.000 --> 54:15.989
of the tyres to give them a bigger
footprint. Now I'm going back on

54:16.000 --> 54:19.989
tarmac, so I need to reinflate them.
All I've got to do is operate these

54:20.000 --> 54:27.989
overhead switches. I feel like a jet
pilot. Compressor on. Going up. And

54:28.000 --> 54:33.989
they can reinflate ALL of these
tyres in under a minute. Oh, I love

54:34.000 --> 54:36.989
this. If I did this in Ledbury I'd
be mobbed by now.

54:37.000 --> 54:46.989
Leaving the Empty Quarter behind, I
headed back towards civilisation.

54:47.000 --> 54:52.989
I'm not going to pretend this is
anything less than a preposterous

54:53.000 --> 54:54.989
machine. It's a six-metre,
three-and-three-quarter tonne,

54:55.000 --> 55:03.989
?370,000, six-wheeled dinosaur, but
as dinosaurs go, it is a magnificent

55:04.000 --> 55:09.989
one. Magnificent to behold,
magnificently made, it's one of the

55:10.000 --> 55:16.989
car world's mad moments. A day off
from Priuses and Leafs. And even in

55:17.000 --> 55:23.989
a country as chock-full of
showy-offy cars as this one, it's

55:24.000 --> 55:26.989
still really rather special. You can
forget your chrome wraps and

55:27.000 --> 55:29.989
whatever, I don't think you can beat
just having more wheels than

55:30.000 --> 55:31.989
anything else, and I can say with
absolute confidence that I have more

55:32.000 --> 55:46.989
wheels than any other... Oh.
No matter, one thing I can say for

55:47.000 --> 55:52.989
sure is that this is the most
extreme Mercedes out here. I doubt

55:53.000 --> 55:54.989
there's anything with a Mercedes
badge in these parts that can draw

55:55.000 --> 56:07.989
as much attention... As that.
All right, so I don't have the most

56:08.000 --> 56:10.989
wheels, it's not the most extreme
Mercedes out here, but the

56:11.000 --> 56:15.989
six-by-six does have size on its
side. Bigger than any Range Rover,

56:16.000 --> 56:19.989
bigger than any Land Cruiser, bigger
than that old Jeep up there and

56:20.000 --> 56:23.989
that's the thing - a car can be
beautiful but when it's big, it's

56:24.000 --> 56:27.989
got presence and they don't come
much bigger than...

56:28.000 --> 57:06.989
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE.
Brilliant. Embarrassingly, whilst

57:07.000 --> 57:10.989
there, I ran the Merc out of petrol
in the place where they actually

57:11.000 --> 57:14.989
grow the stuff. Really? It was
awful, I felt an idiot. Never mind

57:15.000 --> 57:16.989
that, can we just look at that
picture of you at the end?

57:17.000 --> 57:19.989
LAUGHTER.
You do look like something out of

57:20.000 --> 57:23.989
The Borrowers, to be brutally
honest. But I have to say that Jeep

57:24.000 --> 57:27.989
is incredible. Sadly, it was broken
the day I was there, but it does

57:28.000 --> 57:31.989
actually move. And I'd like to see
that one day, but now it is time for

57:32.000 --> 57:36.989
me to demonstrate that cars are
better than motorbikes. Oh, no. Hang

57:37.000 --> 57:40.989
on. Jeremy, we've only got a few
minutes. Yes, yes, listen. Come over

57:41.000 --> 57:43.989
here, because what we have here is a
table laid for two, OK? And I'm

57:44.000 --> 57:45.989
going to remove this tablecloth
without knocking anything over.

57:46.000 --> 57:46.989
Where are you going with
Everybody, stand back behind me,

57:47.000 --> 57:53.989
because
Everybody, stand back behind me,

57:54.000 --> 57:59.989
do this. Well...
CHEERING.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.989
Well, yeah. Oh, well done. That's
really cleared that up for us(!)

58:04.000 --> 58:07.989
Bikes are faster than a table! Or
something. What's that got to do

58:08.000 --> 58:10.989
with anything? It went rather well,
better than I'd expected, if I'm

58:11.000 --> 58:14.989
honest! Anyway, the thing is, BMW
once did that trick with a much

58:15.000 --> 58:34.989
larger table, as I shall now
demonstrate with this bit of film.

58:35.000 --> 58:44.989
CHEERING.
Well, that is tremendous, it's

58:45.000 --> 58:50.989
amazing. Well done, the motorbike.
Yeah. But what I'm going to do now

58:51.000 --> 58:54.989
is that exact same thing only with a
car. You are aware, aren't you, that

58:55.000 --> 58:57.989
a Superbike accelerates very fast?
Yes, Hammond, from say 10-150, but

58:58.000 --> 59:04.989
to do that you need the instant
acceleration, it's 0-10 that

59:05.000 --> 59:07.989
matters. That is a very good point
because it's very difficult to get a

59:08.000 --> 59:11.989
bike off the line. Right, I'll
admit, it usually spins the wheel or

59:12.000 --> 59:14.989
it flips over backwards. You see,
cars don't flip over backwards, it's

59:15.000 --> 59:18.989
one of the many reasons why they're
better. And the car I've selected is

59:19.000 --> 59:22.989
this one. A Datsun? A Nissan GT-R.
No, I approve of your choice of car,

59:23.000 --> 59:26.989
actually, I have to say. Yeah, cos
May and I were playing with one of

59:27.000 --> 59:30.989
these the other day and the way it
sets off is simply unbelievable. I

59:31.000 --> 59:33.989
mean, it really is, there's no car
I've ever driven that goes from 0-10

59:34.000 --> 59:38.989
faster. It's got four-wheel drive
and an amazing launch control

59:39.000 --> 59:42.989
system. So you put your foot hard
down on the accelerator, hard on the

59:43.000 --> 59:46.989
brake, take your foot off the brake,
computer does everything and you set

59:47.000 --> 59:50.989
off. OK, and this is the table,
yeah? Yes, it is. So let's get this

59:51.000 --> 59:53.989
straight. You are going to pull this
tablecloth off this, what, 18ft

59:54.000 --> 59:57.989
table? Yes. Using this Datsun?
Listen... Without breaking anything?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.989
Without knocking a single thing
over. Really? Yes. The words "stand"

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.989
and "back" spring to mind. Ye of
little faith. OK, I'm using the same

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.989
length of rope that BMW did. Same
amount of slack that they did, we're

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.989
pulling from the same place that
they did. Everything is... What?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.989
Have you actually measured this out?
A bit. You've got to go 18ft to get

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.989
the tablecloth off the table, plus
the length of that bit off the

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.989
end... Yes. ..plus you got to
account for the amount of rope and

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.989
you've got to stop before you hit
the other side of the studio. No, I

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.989
haven't. You have. I haven't,
because I'm not going to drive it.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.989
He is. Ladies and gentlemen, The
Stig has come among us.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.989
CHEERING.
Very rarely in the studio. Hold on a

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.989
minute. Very rarely... Hold on a
minute. Yes, what? So you are saying

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.989
he is going to drive across our
darkened studio, peering through his

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.989
darkened visor? Yes. Is this how
this Stig dies?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.989
LAUGHTER.
Has he done a book? No, he hasn't.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.989
Right, is he ready? Are you ready?
LAUGHTER. Everybody here ready?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.989
AUDIENCE: Yes!
Oh, God! We have no idea how it's

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.989
going to work out, but I have hope
in my heart. In three, two, one, go!

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.989
APPLAUSE. JAMES LAUGHS.
Well? That was mostly incredibly

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.989
successful. How, in what way? He
didn't hit the wall, as we can see.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.989
But everything else has hit the
floor, it's smashed to bits! Yes,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.989
but look! There's a whole cup and
saucer, not damaged. It didn't work.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.989
It didn't... It is most odd
actually. Can we see a replay of

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.989
that, maybe work out what
wrong. Oh, there's the problem.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.989
What? He's doing it too slowly. No,
that's in slow motion, you idiot.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.989
Well, if he hadn't have done it in
slow motion, it would have worked!

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.989
For crying out loud! But now look!
It's a disaster. It's a bombshell.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.989
And that means we can end. Yes. Mm.
Thank you ever so much for watching,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
we'll see you next week. Take care
and good night.
