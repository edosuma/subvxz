12:11.897 --> 12:13.607
The proposal was wack.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.775
Uh...

12:15.985 --> 12:18.237
He proposed to me in the morning.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.658
That's, like, when people
in a nursing home get engaged. Like...

12:22.742 --> 12:23.951
[laughter]

12:25.578 --> 12:29.290
Not, like, at sunrise. I was still asleep.
I was sleeping,

12:29.832 --> 12:32.042
and I sleep like I'm still in the womb.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.211
Earplugs, eye mask...

12:35.004 --> 12:37.047
my mom's legs around my shoulders. Like...

12:37.131 --> 12:38.299
[laughter]

12:39.049 --> 12:41.093
You know? Recreate.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.887
Every morning, I'm born and...

12:45.723 --> 12:46.807
So I'm...

12:47.600 --> 12:49.560
in the womb, and he comes in,

12:50.227 --> 12:52.897
and I just took one ear plug out.
I was like...

12:54.607 --> 12:58.444
And he kind of threw the ring box at me,
and he goes, "I got you this."

13:00.321 --> 13:02.239
And I open it, and...

13:02.323 --> 13:03.324
And he goes,

13:03.407 --> 13:06.035
"Do you want me to get down on one knee?"
and I was like,

13:06.410 --> 13:07.745
"I guess not."

13:08.162 --> 13:09.413
[laughter]

13:09.830 --> 13:11.832
And then I went back to sleep.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.417
[laughter]

13:14.335 --> 13:18.047
That's the truth. That's a real ass
proposal, though. That's like a real...

13:18.547 --> 13:19.381
You know?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.259
'Cause, like, in movies and TV shows,

13:22.343 --> 13:24.887
the guy always gets down on one knee,
right?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.889
And the girl's always shocked.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.058
[gasps]

13:29.934 --> 13:32.144
"I didn't even know you liked me!

13:32.228 --> 13:33.395
[laughter]

13:33.771 --> 13:36.106
I'm still on Bumble. Like, this is..."

13:36.232 --> 13:37.399
[laughter]

13:38.859 --> 13:39.860
[chuckles]

13:41.946 --> 13:44.990
Like, you didn't talk about--
That's a very big decision...

13:46.116 --> 13:49.370
to not talk about. I don't know any girl
who got engaged that way.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.705
I'm from New York.
All my girlfriends are from New York.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.207
We get married late there.

13:53.290 --> 13:57.962
When you get engaged at 40, it's like,
"Whoa, teen bride! Like, slow...

13:58.045 --> 13:59.255
[laughter]

14:02.716 --> 14:04.510
Slow it down. Get to know him."

14:08.889 --> 14:10.224
I think there are only two reasons

14:10.307 --> 14:13.060
you should get down on one knee
if you're a guy.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.020
If you're a player in the NFL...

14:15.938 --> 14:18.482
[crowd cheering]

14:22.278 --> 14:25.322
and to eat my pussy. Those are the two...

14:25.447 --> 14:27.700
[cheering and applause]

14:28.033 --> 14:29.034
Two reasons.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.705
I mean, if the guy you're with

14:33.122 --> 14:37.877
gets, like, synchronized swans
to dance to Bruno Mars, you know?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.087
He's gay.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.339
[laughter]

14:43.424 --> 14:45.050
That's a gay guy.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.807
And, look, we all have a friend
married to a gay guy. We do.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.142
[laughter]

14:53.642 --> 14:56.312
We do. You're probably here
with a couple right now.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.605
[laughter]

14:58.439 --> 15:01.275
And they're like,
"Talk about Meghan Markle more."

15:01.442 --> 15:03.569
[laughter]

15:09.909 --> 15:11.243
We've had that experience, right?

15:11.327 --> 15:14.371
When you meet the couple
for the first time,

15:14.747 --> 15:16.999
and then they leave,
and then a couple of your friends,

15:17.082 --> 15:19.752
you're taking each other's temperature.
You're like...

15:20.753 --> 15:22.546
"Jeff was nice, right?"

15:22.713 --> 15:23.881
[laughter]

15:23.964 --> 15:24.798
"Yeah.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.301
Yeah. Jeff was cool, yeah."

15:29.553 --> 15:32.306
"You said he's a costume designer.
He's a-- Yeah."

15:36.352 --> 15:38.938
And then finally someone's like,
"Is Jeff gay?"

15:39.021 --> 15:41.023
You're like, "Jeff is gay! Yes!"

15:41.106 --> 15:42.316
[laughter]

15:45.444 --> 15:47.071
And we all laugh at our friend.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.115
"Hee-hee, she's married to a gay guy."
But you know what?

15:50.532 --> 15:53.869
Someone with hyperemesis
who's five months pregnant,

15:53.953 --> 15:57.331
you know who sounds like it would be fun
to be married to right now?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.000
Fucking Jeff.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.543
[laughter]

16:02.920 --> 16:04.129
Get on one knee for Jeff.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.968
I think-- I don't want to jinx it.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.428
I think I don't have to be
a bridesmaid anymore.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.890
Yeah, I think I've done--
I'm not making no new friends.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.227
Everybody got married. I was the last one.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.606
'Cause when you get in your late 30s,
there's just no dignity to it, you know?

16:23.732 --> 16:29.071
It's like me in a Grecian gown
with my aging cleavage and like...

16:29.989 --> 16:32.366
a Coachella flower halo.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.450
I'm just like...

16:33.701 --> 16:34.868
[laughter]

16:39.123 --> 16:42.876
Just hoping I'm not the bridesmaid
with the biggest arm, you know?

16:42.960 --> 16:43.794
I'm like...

16:44.086 --> 16:45.254
[laughter]

16:46.714 --> 16:48.132
I hold my arm out.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.096
'Cause people used to get married
in their early 20s.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.889
You had a little
20-year-old bridesmaid arm.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.643
You were holding your champagne like,
"It's heavy!" [giggling]

16:59.727 --> 17:01.311
[laughter]

17:04.523 --> 17:08.193
Now it's just a sea of turkey legs,
just... [blows raspberry]

17:08.277 --> 17:09.445
[laughter]

17:12.740 --> 17:16.160
Looks like the defensive line
for the Bears are in the wedding.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.411
[laughter]

17:18.162 --> 17:20.289
-[laughs]
-[crowd cheers, applauds]

17:25.794 --> 17:29.214
I really respect you guys for coming out
because if you follow me on Instagram,

17:29.298 --> 17:31.884
you're probably like,
"Is this bitch in the hospital?

17:32.968 --> 17:34.762
Is she gonna be there?"

17:35.554 --> 17:37.389
[cheering and applause]

17:38.348 --> 17:39.183
Yeah.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.476
I made it. I...

17:41.143 --> 17:43.145
I've been hospitalized a couple of times

17:43.645 --> 17:46.315
since I've been pregnant 
with hyperemesis and...

17:46.815 --> 17:48.108
The very first time

17:48.192 --> 17:50.694
was about a month ago, and...

17:51.403 --> 17:53.697
I was throwing up for about five hours

17:53.781 --> 17:54.740
when I...

17:55.532 --> 17:56.700
was taken to the hospital.

17:57.284 --> 18:01.121
The doctor came in, and he explained to me
and my sister and my husband,

18:01.205 --> 18:03.207
who were are all in the room. He said,

18:03.749 --> 18:06.293
"You're going to be here
for at least five hours getting liquids."

18:06.752 --> 18:10.089
And without skipping a beat,
my husband said to my sister,

18:10.172 --> 18:14.051
"Okay, cool, because I saw a place
where you can paint pottery nearby."

18:14.510 --> 18:15.677
[laughter]

18:17.346 --> 18:19.139
You guys are like, "Is he gay?"

18:19.223 --> 18:20.390
[laughter]

18:23.644 --> 18:28.148
So my sister didn't even, like, check in
with me if it was cool that they left me.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.235
As soon as he said "pottery,"
they just left.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.861
[laughter]

18:32.945 --> 18:35.322
And I was like, "I'll be here."

18:38.534 --> 18:42.579
And about an hour and a half later,
my sister rushed back in the room,

18:42.663 --> 18:44.081
and she said, "Okay, listen.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.084
Be nice to him about what he painted."

18:47.668 --> 18:48.836
[laughter]

18:49.711 --> 18:50.546
I'm like...

18:51.171 --> 18:52.047
"Okay."

18:52.131 --> 18:54.842
She's like, "I'm serious.
He worked really hard on it."

18:54.925 --> 18:56.093
[laughter]

19:00.764 --> 19:01.723
"Okay." She goes...

19:02.641 --> 19:05.060
"And it's not very flattering."
I'm like, "What?"

19:08.230 --> 19:10.649
But my husband's brain
is a little different.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.235
'Cause you go to these places,

19:13.318 --> 19:18.448
you usually paint a teddy bear
or a jewelry box, you know,

19:18.532 --> 19:21.160
but my husband decided to...

19:21.827 --> 19:23.078
to paint a plate...

19:24.246 --> 19:26.123
which he would use as a canvas...

19:27.124 --> 19:28.458
to paint me.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.127
[laughter]

19:32.379 --> 19:34.298
And I'm going to show you the picture.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.927
I think it's important
for you guys to see the picture. Um...

19:40.220 --> 19:43.265
And I want to show you this,
and I want you to know

19:43.348 --> 19:46.935
that there were no qualifiers
before he showed me this picture.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.314
He was sure it was pretty good.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.440
[laughter]

19:51.523 --> 19:53.358
This is the picture that he painted.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.945
[crowd laughing loudly]

20:08.248 --> 20:10.500
I was in the hospital, guys.

20:12.544 --> 20:17.007
What is-- I wanted to go,
"What's with my chin on my neck?"

20:17.174 --> 20:20.052
I look like Trump. Like, I look...

20:20.177 --> 20:21.345
[laughter]

20:26.516 --> 20:28.977
I couldn't say any of this to him, okay?

20:30.187 --> 20:33.106
Get rid of it. People are leaving.
This is upsetting.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.608
This is an upsetting image.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.902
I mean...

20:36.985 --> 20:39.529
[cheering, whooping]

20:40.364 --> 20:42.241
I had to comfort him.

20:43.325 --> 20:47.204
[sighs]
My husband is a really great sport.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.832
You know? He really is.
I keep messing with him.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.335
Like, you know,
I've had a tough pregnancy, so...

20:53.961 --> 20:57.214
the other day, I was like, "Babe,
this is kind of too hard for me.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.674
I don't think I can do it."

20:59.925 --> 21:01.093
[laughter]

21:02.928 --> 21:05.722
And he's like, "What do you mean?"
And I was like...

21:06.556 --> 21:08.600
"What do you think I mean? I think I...

21:09.476 --> 21:10.936
I need to get an abortion."

21:11.353 --> 21:12.521
[laughter]

21:14.356 --> 21:16.233
And this was his response. He went...

21:17.025 --> 21:18.235
"Really?"

21:18.443 --> 21:19.611
[laughter]

21:22.572 --> 21:24.908
I was like, "No! What?"

21:25.033 --> 21:26.201
[laughter]

21:27.119 --> 21:28.912
I'm going to announce it on Instagram,

21:28.996 --> 21:32.457
and then I'm going to be like,
"Actually, forget it. I don't like it.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.792
[laughter]

21:34.501 --> 21:36.586
I'm tired. I don't like it."

21:39.131 --> 21:41.383
Thank God that was his response,
you know?

21:42.342 --> 21:44.970
What if he'd been like,
"Cool. I'll warm up the car."

21:45.053 --> 21:46.847
[laughter]

21:52.352 --> 21:53.770
I knew from the beginning

21:53.854 --> 21:56.690
that my husband's brain
was a little different than mine.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.609
Um, and about...

22:00.944 --> 22:03.697
I have to start this over
'cause I really want to get this right.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.908
Because I love him very much.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.493
And...

22:09.411 --> 22:14.291
My husband was diagnosed with
what used to be called Asperger's.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.335
He has autism spectrum disorder.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.045
He's on the spectrum.

22:18.628 --> 22:19.463
And...

22:19.921 --> 22:22.466
there were some signs early on, like...

22:23.050 --> 22:26.928
we went for a walk about a year ago,
and I fell.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.599
And kinda nine out of ten people would go,

22:31.183 --> 22:32.976
"Oh, my God! Are you okay?"

22:35.020 --> 22:36.188
[laughter]

22:36.563 --> 22:37.397
Right?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.858
Maybe more like ten out of ten people.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.109
[laughter]

22:41.902 --> 22:43.904
"Oh, my God! Are you okay?"

22:44.738 --> 22:46.782
But instead, my husband went...

22:49.242 --> 22:51.453
[laughter]

22:51.745 --> 22:55.874
He kind of froze and became a lighthouse,
opening and closing his mouth, just...

22:55.957 --> 22:58.502
[silently mouthing]

22:58.668 --> 22:59.836
[laughter]

23:01.046 --> 23:03.548
And I remember lying on the ground
looking up at him,

23:03.632 --> 23:05.467
and I wasn't mad. I just thought,

23:06.051 --> 23:06.885
"Huh!"

23:07.260 --> 23:09.221
[laughter]

23:12.599 --> 23:14.893
A lot of "huh" moments, you know?

23:18.855 --> 23:20.482
And once he was diagnosed,

23:21.024 --> 23:23.944
it dawned on me how funny it was
because all of the characteristics

23:24.027 --> 23:25.779
that make it clear
that he's on the spectrum

23:25.862 --> 23:29.491
are all of the reasons
that I fell madly in love with him.

23:30.784 --> 23:31.785
That's the truth.

23:31.868 --> 23:35.247
[cheering and applause]

23:37.749 --> 23:41.211
He says whatever is on his mind.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.880
He keeps it so real, you know?

23:43.964 --> 23:49.594
He doesn't care about social norms
or what you expect him to say or do.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.304
You know, if I say to him, like,

23:51.638 --> 23:53.223
"Does this look like shit?" He'll go,

23:53.306 --> 23:56.852
"Yeah. You have a lot of other clothes.
Why don't you wear those?" I'm like...

23:56.935 --> 23:57.894
[laughter]

23:57.978 --> 23:59.229
"Okay."

24:01.606 --> 24:03.233
[laughter]

24:07.446 --> 24:09.656
But he can also make me feel
more beautiful

24:09.739 --> 24:11.783
than anyone ever has my whole life.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.077
Yeah, it's true.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.163
[cheering]

24:18.748 --> 24:20.250
And he can't lie.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.671
Is that the dream man,
a guy who can't lie?

24:26.131 --> 24:29.885
But that also means
that he can't lie for me.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.344
[laughter]

24:31.845 --> 24:35.056
Which is an essential part
of any relationship.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.102
We're friends with this couple,
and they broke up,

24:39.519 --> 24:42.772
and the guy started dating a new girl
pretty soon after,

24:42.856 --> 24:45.525
and we happened to be at the party
where they got together,

24:45.609 --> 24:48.278
so I didn't rush to tell the ex-girlfriend
what happened.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.240
So a couple of months later,
we had dinner with her, and she was like,

24:52.324 --> 24:55.785
"And, you know, at that party,
that's when they got together."

24:56.870 --> 24:57.913
And I was like...

24:58.497 --> 24:59.748
"No!

25:00.207 --> 25:01.374
[laughter]

25:02.042 --> 25:03.418
It's not possible."

25:05.045 --> 25:06.129
And Chris goes...

25:06.922 --> 25:08.548
"No, you remember."

25:08.632 --> 25:10.050
[laughter]

25:15.222 --> 25:16.056
[quietly] "No.

25:17.432 --> 25:18.475
No, I don't."

25:18.558 --> 25:22.729
"Yeah, remember? 'Cause you said,
'Oh, my God, he's leaving with her.'"

25:23.271 --> 25:24.439
[laughter]

25:29.027 --> 25:31.655
"Thank you, Chris! Thank you.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.074
I guess I forgot about that."

25:34.533 --> 25:35.700
[laughter]

25:39.913 --> 25:44.626
Also, one of the the signs of autism
is you don't make sort of the...

25:44.709 --> 25:47.379
appropriate facial expression
for the occasion you're at.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.299
So we were gonna go on a red carpet
together for the first time,

25:51.383 --> 25:54.928
and we were practicing his smiles,
you know,

25:55.011 --> 25:57.889
and we didn't land on one
that we were in love with.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.474
[laughter]

26:01.268 --> 26:03.937
So we were out of time, so I said,
"Just...

26:04.020 --> 26:06.898
This is what I do. Just think
about something you love, you know?"

26:06.982 --> 26:08.692
And he loves the ocean, so...

26:09.317 --> 26:13.196
So we went out there and it worked,
but it worked too well.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.864
[laughter]

26:15.073 --> 26:18.326
'Cause in all the pictures, I'm doing
my normal bullshit, and he was like...

26:20.078 --> 26:22.330
[laughter]

26:28.253 --> 26:31.631
I noticed. I was like, "A pond.
Just like you're glancing at a pond.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.757
Pull it back."

26:32.841 --> 26:33.800
[laughter]

26:37.304 --> 26:39.639
It's exciting being pregnant.
It's not all bad.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.975
The best part about it

26:42.642 --> 26:44.185
is not getting your period.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.605
[women whooping]

26:46.688 --> 26:50.734
Yeah. That's the silver uterine lining,
if you want to look for one.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.235
[laughter]

26:52.819 --> 26:55.864
That's nice because, you know,
what I realized,

26:55.947 --> 26:57.782
right before I got pregnant, I noticed...

26:58.450 --> 26:59.743
how ashamed...

27:00.327 --> 27:02.871
we've all been made to feel
about getting our period...

27:03.413 --> 27:05.290
our whole lives.
Like we choose it, you know?

27:05.373 --> 27:08.460
Like, "Can't kick my bleeding habit,
you know?

27:08.752 --> 27:09.919
[laughter]

27:11.129 --> 27:13.006
I just want it. I want to do it."

27:16.426 --> 27:19.846
It's supposed to be, you know, a secret.
The second you get it, your mom goes,

27:19.929 --> 27:21.181
"You're a woman now.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.267
And that's disgusting.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.602
[laughter]

27:26.645 --> 27:29.606
Never let anyone know
of your filthy secret."

27:31.650 --> 27:35.195
And you're like, "Okay. I'm 12.
I'm ready to handle this."

27:35.487 --> 27:36.655
[laughter]

27:38.031 --> 27:39.908
This is my Rainbow Brite lunch box.

27:39.991 --> 27:43.119
♪ Rainbow Brite
Stars are shining bright ♪

27:46.331 --> 27:48.083
And it is.
That's the most embarrassing thing

27:48.166 --> 27:49.918
that could possibly happen
to you as a kid,

27:50.001 --> 27:53.004
that someone knows you have your period,
or they see you have your period.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.547
At that age, for men,

27:54.631 --> 27:57.550
the most embarrassing thing
is unwanted erections, right?

27:58.843 --> 28:01.429
But then they grow up
and show them to everyone.

28:01.554 --> 28:02.722
[laughter]

28:07.477 --> 28:09.270
Maybe that's what we should do.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.273
[laughter, applause]

28:14.317 --> 28:15.318
I don't know.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.531
Call a coworker into your office.

Psst.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.443
All this talk about dick pics,
how about a tamp pic?

28:56.735 --> 28:57.902
[laughter]

28:58.945 --> 28:59.946
You up?

29:00.822 --> 29:02.991

29:07.203 --> 29:10.957
If you're still in a position
where you're getting dick pics, ladies,

29:11.040 --> 29:13.001
I have a suggestion for you.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.502
When you get a dick pic...

29:15.712 --> 29:17.380
send back...

29:18.548 --> 29:20.008
a dick pic.

You go, "Oh, I'm sorry.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.521
I thought we were exchanging
our favorite dick pics.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.857
[laughter]

29:38.860 --> 29:41.488
Dick for dick, pic for pic, no?
I thought..."

29:47.535 --> 29:52.248
Why are we made to feel so ashamed
of a natural bodily function

29:52.332 --> 29:55.335
that ultimately brings life, you know?
It's like...

29:56.044 --> 29:58.755
If you forget a tampon, 
you have to bum one from somebody.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.883
What we all do is,
first, you look around...

30:02.675 --> 30:03.843
[laughter]

30:04.427 --> 30:06.513
like you're going to say something racist,
just like...

30:06.888 --> 30:08.556
[laughter]

30:10.350 --> 30:14.062
And whatever race you thought I meant,
that's your problem. And...

30:14.145 --> 30:15.480
[laughter]

30:16.189 --> 30:19.317
Then you kind of lean in, 
and we don't even say the whole sentence.

30:19.943 --> 30:20.944
We kind of go...

30:21.444 --> 30:22.695
"Does anybody have a..."

30:23.655 --> 30:24.656
[muttering] "Tampon?"

30:24.948 --> 30:26.115
[laughter]

30:27.116 --> 30:29.202
What is this? What's the claw?

30:30.078 --> 30:32.121
That's how disgusted we are
with ourselves.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.207
[muttering] "Does anyone have a tampon?"

30:34.666 --> 30:35.834
[laughter]

30:36.835 --> 30:38.294
And I notice myself do it.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.672
I was in a gym locker room.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.715
Thank you. And...

30:45.134 --> 30:48.596
And there were a bunch of women 
in there, and I... [mutters]

30:50.598 --> 30:53.476
And this woman across the locker room
with so much confidence was like,

30:53.560 --> 30:55.144
"Oh, yeah, I do. What size?"

30:55.562 --> 30:56.563
[laughter]

31:00.233 --> 31:01.234
And, like,

31:01.317 --> 31:03.903
obviously, I know there are
different sizes of tampons,

31:03.987 --> 31:05.655
but I've never been confronted...

31:06.281 --> 31:07.448
[laughter]

31:08.324 --> 31:10.159
...with that question before, you know?

31:12.829 --> 31:15.957
She's like, "Yeah, what's
the circumference of your pussy hole?

31:16.207 --> 31:17.375
[laughter]

31:25.216 --> 31:27.927
Grande or venti?
What are we plugging, bitch?

31:30.305 --> 31:32.015
I've got Pilates. What is it?"

31:36.603 --> 31:38.229
Then all the other women
in the locker room

31:38.313 --> 31:40.315
kinda lean in to hear...

31:40.481 --> 31:41.649
[laughter]

31:41.816 --> 31:43.234
...my answer, you know?

31:44.652 --> 31:45.737
I'm just like...

31:46.738 --> 31:48.281
"I don't know. Do you have, like, a...

31:48.781 --> 31:51.409
super Grand Canyon? I don't know.

31:51.826 --> 31:52.994
[laughter]

31:54.120 --> 31:55.663
Just throw me a futon mattress.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.874
I'll just kind of squat over it."

31:58.082 --> 31:59.250
[laughter]

32:06.716 --> 32:08.968
My vagina is going to get bigger, I heard.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.345
Whoo!

32:11.638 --> 32:14.098
Can't wait. Take up more space. Lean in!

32:17.936 --> 32:20.188
It's already grown.
It just grows over the years.

32:20.271 --> 32:23.483
I know because, I mean, when I was 
younger, I could put a Tic Tac in there

32:23.566 --> 32:25.944
and then just walk around all day.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.155
At night, I swear it would
still be in the same place, just... Whoop!

32:32.325 --> 32:33.618
Now...

32:34.744 --> 32:37.205
if I have a yeast infection, which I do...

32:37.747 --> 32:39.415
[laughter]

32:40.792 --> 32:43.670
and I try to put
one of those Monistat suppositories in,

32:43.753 --> 32:46.506
it just falls right on the floor.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.216
[laughter]

32:51.844 --> 32:54.263
Whoop! Be careful. They're very slippery.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.307
[laughter]

32:59.644 --> 33:00.478
I do.

33:00.561 --> 33:02.897
I have a yeast infection.

33:04.524 --> 33:08.277
I'm gonna address it 'cause I have to do
the pinch. You guys know the pinch.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.781
Ladies, just a quick, little pinch.

33:12.281 --> 33:13.825
[laughter]

33:15.118 --> 33:19.122
But I'm really excited about this.
We don't even need tampons anymore.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.623
There's a new invention.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.875
-You guys know what I'm talking about?
-[woman] DivaCup!

33:22.959 --> 33:24.585
No, not the DivaCup.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.714
-That is terrifying. Um...
-[laughter]

33:27.797 --> 33:29.257
The DivaCup-- Do you know what it is?

33:29.340 --> 33:32.343
It's like this little cup you store
in the back of your vagina,

33:32.427 --> 33:33.928
and it collects...

33:34.637 --> 33:37.181
and at the end of the day,
you pull it out and you kinda Kill Bill.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.017
Just kind of... [whoosh]

33:39.100 --> 33:40.393
[laughter]

33:40.476 --> 33:42.645
[imitates spraying]

33:43.688 --> 33:44.772
[laughter]

33:45.398 --> 33:47.942
No!

33:48.526 --> 33:49.736
[laughter]

33:50.695 --> 33:51.696
It's a lot.

33:52.822 --> 33:53.906
It's too much for me.

33:55.283 --> 33:57.452
I respect you
if you can handle the DivaCup.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.042
Such a confident name. "I'm a Diva."

34:04.542 --> 34:05.710
[laughter]

34:06.919 --> 34:07.754
No.

34:08.629 --> 34:10.298
It's more exciting than the DivaCup.

34:10.381 --> 34:13.384
It's a new invention called THINX.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.012
Yes. Yeah, you don't need a tampon.

34:16.095 --> 34:19.557
They're just these underwear
that you just bleed into.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.727
Which I guess...

34:23.728 --> 34:26.147
makes me a fucking inventor.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.025
[laughter]

34:31.652 --> 34:33.780
Ah! Who knew?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.449
Should I go on Shark Tank?

34:36.991 --> 34:38.159
[laughter]

34:39.952 --> 34:40.995
"Sharks..."

34:41.871 --> 34:43.039
[laughter]

34:48.503 --> 34:53.591
Did anyone have a mom like me
who didn't really trust tampons

34:53.674 --> 34:57.386
and made them only wear a pad? Right?

34:59.347 --> 35:01.516
And millennials,
if you don't know what a pad is,

35:02.100 --> 35:04.143
congratulations, and...

35:05.144 --> 35:09.148
A pad is kind of a foot-long diaper
that you...

35:09.357 --> 35:10.525
[laughter]

35:10.608 --> 35:13.277
...coil betwixt your legs, and...

35:14.320 --> 35:17.782
just kinda waddle around all day
wearing it, just...

35:19.158 --> 35:19.992
Crunch!

35:21.452 --> 35:22.370
Crunch!

35:22.453 --> 35:25.331
Kinda always sounds like 
there's a killer right behind you.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.667
[laughter]

35:33.297 --> 35:35.049
[laughter]

35:36.676 --> 35:38.052
They were great. Yeah.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.305
Little adhesive wings.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.057
[laughter]

35:43.975 --> 35:46.853
They'd always stick right to your pubes.
It was a treat.

35:46.936 --> 35:47.812
[laughter]

35:47.895 --> 35:49.981
It was a real treat. Sorry you missed it.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.694
I'm sorry. Millennials...

36:16.591 --> 36:18.926
Did you guys see your mom's bush
growing up?

36:20.219 --> 36:21.804
It's kind of comforting, right?

36:24.140 --> 36:26.517
The first time you see it,
I'll never forget.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.019
[laughter]

36:28.853 --> 36:32.773
I remember I walked in the bathroom
to say goodnight. I was like, "Mom!

36:32.857 --> 36:34.025
[laughter]

36:40.615 --> 36:42.575
[laughter]

36:45.995 --> 36:47.830
Oh. Hi, Mom. Good night."

36:47.914 --> 36:49.081
[laughter]

36:54.170 --> 36:55.504
I remember Mom's bush.

36:59.008 --> 37:00.885
I also had one of those moms...

37:02.011 --> 37:03.221
who told me,

37:03.304 --> 37:06.807
"You only have to shave up to your knee."

37:07.934 --> 37:10.353
Right? "Just shave up to your knee."

37:11.979 --> 37:14.190
I'd say, "Mom, I'm pretty hairy up..."

37:14.273 --> 37:15.274
"No!

37:16.067 --> 37:16.984
The knee."

37:17.485 --> 37:18.444
"Okay."

37:21.113 --> 37:23.783
I'd be at the community pool.
People are like...

37:24.200 --> 37:25.368
[laughter]

37:28.287 --> 37:30.665
"Why is Amy wearing wool shorts?"

37:30.873 --> 37:32.041
[laughter]

37:42.093 --> 37:45.221
But I have to give it up for my mom.
She made me so confident.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.807
She just straight lied to me as a kid.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.225
[laughter]

37:49.433 --> 37:51.310
It's tough to say "confident"...

37:52.019 --> 37:53.521
as a woman, you know?

37:53.604 --> 37:56.816
You put on TV.
We see all these gorgeous women.

37:57.316 --> 38:00.861
We have to compete with what's her face,
the Mother of Dragons.

38:00.945 --> 38:01.779
What's her name?

38:01.862 --> 38:04.365
-[woman] Khaleesi!
-Kris Jenner. It's just...

38:04.448 --> 38:05.908
[laughter]

38:08.577 --> 38:09.870
It's tough.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.956
It's tough out there.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.874
[cheering]

38:15.042 --> 38:16.961
No, I love the Kardashians.

38:17.586 --> 38:21.257
The Kardashians are so confident,
they confuse me about my own confidence.

38:21.340 --> 38:24.719
So before I was pregnant, I was
kind of like feeling myself one day,

38:24.802 --> 38:26.304
and I bought lingerie.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.221
Like...

38:27.305 --> 38:28.514
the real shit.

38:29.015 --> 38:29.890
Like...

38:29.974 --> 38:32.393
the, you know, fishnets, and then...

38:32.476 --> 38:34.478
like the pulley system here.

38:34.937 --> 38:35.771
You know?

38:36.564 --> 38:38.316
Thought they would've updated
that technology,

38:38.399 --> 38:41.819
but it's still a pulley system,
and then, you know, the boost--

38:41.902 --> 38:43.404
Whatever it's called. And...

38:43.863 --> 38:45.740
You know, I went. I paid for it.

38:46.490 --> 38:50.411
I tried it on at home, you know, 
where I could take my own life, and...

38:50.619 --> 38:51.787
[laughter]

38:52.830 --> 38:54.999
In the safety of home, and...

38:57.668 --> 39:00.588
I tried it on, and I was kind of ready
to blow my own mind.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.214
[laughter]

39:02.715 --> 39:06.635
I kind of sidled up to the mirror,
and I check myself out, and I was like,

39:06.719 --> 39:08.179
"Oh.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.099
This isn't for everybody.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.642
[laughter]

39:15.436 --> 39:16.604
Hmm.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.773
Okay."

39:20.733 --> 39:22.777
I looked like I should have been
on Law &amp; Order, like,

39:22.860 --> 39:24.403
"He went that way."

39:24.570 --> 39:25.738
[laughter]

39:34.038 --> 39:37.291
My fishnets looked like
they'd caught an actual fish. It was...

39:37.375 --> 39:38.417
[laughter]

39:41.629 --> 39:42.880
It was pretty confusing.

39:45.883 --> 39:48.052
It's tough to say "confident" as a girl.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.180
I don't know what I'm having.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.515
I hope it's a girl.

39:53.182 --> 39:54.225
Um...

39:54.975 --> 39:58.687
But really just because
it's such a scary time for men.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.148
[laughter]

40:02.942 --> 40:06.737
[cheering, applause]

40:08.697 --> 40:12.993
Such a scary time. Men, thank you so much
for leaving your houses tonight.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.120
I just...

40:15.496 --> 40:16.455
God.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.457
First responders, just...

40:19.291 --> 40:20.501
so brave.

40:22.503 --> 40:26.549
I don't know if men know how scared we are
as women all the time.

40:28.050 --> 40:32.638
Like, one in three of us will be assaulted
at some point in our lives.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.890
If you're a woman of color,
it's even more than that.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.393
If you're a trans woman, forget it.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.979
At night in New York,

40:40.062 --> 40:43.524
if I take the subway at night,
I will run home.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.526
Women, we run home.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.486
Not for the cardio.

40:48.612 --> 40:51.157
It's true. When you walk to your car
in a dark parking lot,

40:51.240 --> 40:52.116
what do you ladies do?

40:52.199 --> 40:55.995
We do the little makeshift brass knuckle
with our key, right?

40:56.912 --> 40:59.832
I don't know what our plan is
with that key in our knuckle.

41:00.833 --> 41:01.917
"Oh, no, you don't!

41:02.001 --> 41:03.544
Ahh!

41:06.255 --> 41:09.091
Not on my watch. Boop-boop!" I mean...

41:09.175 --> 41:10.176
[laughter]

41:13.637 --> 41:18.225
There was a study done, and it said
that women mostly fear violence.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.685
That's our number one fear.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.273
And the same study
showed that men's number one fear...

41:25.357 --> 41:26.567
was ridicule.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.863
Oh... Yeah, God!

41:30.988 --> 41:32.156
[laughter]

41:33.115 --> 41:36.118
I'm so sorry. I didn't know 
you guys were going through that.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.620
[laughter]

41:38.204 --> 41:40.206
It must be so hard for you.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.292
Do you guys run home?

41:44.752 --> 41:48.088
Because you're afraid of somebody
telling a little jokey about you?

41:48.172 --> 41:49.340
[laughter]

41:50.299 --> 41:52.676
[women whooping, cheering]

41:55.721 --> 41:57.223
[laughs]

41:59.725 --> 42:03.604
I think that we need to start 
from scratch, you know?

42:03.687 --> 42:07.858
I'm so grateful to this new generation
of women that came along and they're like,

42:07.942 --> 42:11.278
"Hey, have you been getting sexually
harassed like this your whole lives?"

42:11.362 --> 42:12.196
And we're like,

42:12.947 --> 42:13.948
"Oh, yeah!"

42:14.406 --> 42:15.824
[laughter]

42:16.825 --> 42:20.496
And they're like, "Yeah. You wanna
do something about that?" And we're like,

42:21.163 --> 42:22.623
"Oh, yeah.

42:22.706 --> 42:23.832
[laughter]

42:23.916 --> 42:26.043
That's a very good idea."

42:26.752 --> 42:29.672
They're like, "Yeah."
And we're like, "Oh."

42:29.755 --> 42:31.840
We're so used to it, you know?

42:32.633 --> 42:34.426
You're at work, and you're like,

42:34.510 --> 42:37.596
"I have to make every guy think
that we also might fuck

42:37.680 --> 42:39.223
and do a good job."

42:39.473 --> 42:40.641
[laughter]

42:42.476 --> 42:44.270
It's not fair.
It's not fair to men either.

42:44.353 --> 42:48.607
You guys are raised with so much pressure
to be so masculine at such a young age.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.192
It's bullshit.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.611
It sucks.
It's like a six-year-old kid crying.

42:53.195 --> 42:54.905
"Stop crying, you little pussy."

42:55.030 --> 42:56.198
[laughter]

42:57.741 --> 43:00.536
We toughen them up at a young age
so they don't get made fun of,

43:00.619 --> 43:04.039
and then, as little girls,
you're in school with these boys,

43:04.123 --> 43:07.585
and when a little boy is mean to you
or he teases you, what does everybody say?

43:07.668 --> 43:10.004
-[woman] He likes you.
-"He likes you."

43:10.421 --> 43:11.630
Ooh!

43:12.423 --> 43:15.009
You're like, "He knocked my books
out of my hands."

43:15.426 --> 43:17.011
"Whoo!

43:17.094 --> 43:18.345
[laughter]

43:18.429 --> 43:21.140
Looks like somebody
has a little boyfriend at school.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.434
That's a good thing."

43:23.767 --> 43:25.519
And you're like, "Oh.

43:25.978 --> 43:27.229
That's a good thing!

43:27.730 --> 43:28.897
Okay!

43:29.315 --> 43:31.317
I'm the luckiest girl in school."

43:31.525 --> 43:32.693
[laughter]

43:33.152 --> 43:34.445
"He pushed me down the stairs."

43:34.528 --> 43:35.904
"You're going to prom!"

43:35.988 --> 43:37.031
"Prom!"

43:37.364 --> 43:38.616
[laughter]

43:39.199 --> 43:42.036
Right? Then we grow up
and we all have friends who were like,

43:42.119 --> 43:43.912
"Why do I only date assholes?"

43:44.538 --> 43:47.666
'Cause you've been trained to do that
since you were a toddler.

43:48.334 --> 43:51.295
You know, we have friends who are like,
"You should see us when we're alone.

43:51.378 --> 43:54.757
He's still really mean to me,
but it's not as embarrassing."

43:54.840 --> 43:55.841
[giggles]

43:57.426 --> 44:00.054
It doesn't occur to us
to be with someone who's kind

44:00.137 --> 44:02.389
until we're, like, almost dead, you know?

44:02.973 --> 44:04.141
[laughter]

44:05.976 --> 44:09.563
I mean, who cares? We're about to lose
our rights, anyway. Right, ladies?

44:10.564 --> 44:13.984
Take 'em. I'm sick of it.
Give me my bonnet. Give me my cape.

44:14.526 --> 44:15.694
[laughter]

44:16.153 --> 44:19.198
I'm ready.
Done washing my hair all the time.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.994
I mean, look at us making decisions
about our own bodies.

44:24.078 --> 44:25.913
Who do we think we are? Men?

44:26.997 --> 44:27.998
Come on!

44:28.499 --> 44:30.125
Decisions are hard.

44:32.336 --> 44:33.921
Rights feel heavy.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.506
[laughter]

44:36.924 --> 44:41.136
I want people who know better than anyone
making the decisions about my body.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.139
I want to call up Mitch McConnell
and be like, "Girl!

44:44.556 --> 44:45.557
[laughter]

44:45.641 --> 44:49.395
My discharge is brown, baby girl.
What should I do?

44:51.146 --> 44:52.439
Mitch!

44:53.482 --> 44:57.444
Chuck Grassley, I've got cramps.
Am I ovulating, queen?

44:57.945 --> 44:59.279
[laughter]

45:00.155 --> 45:02.616
Lindsey mammo-Graham, feel this.
What you think?

45:03.283 --> 45:04.410
You guys know."

45:07.454 --> 45:10.165
Maybe some of you heard
I got arrested in October.

45:10.791 --> 45:13.210
-[cheering]
-Thank you.

45:14.628 --> 45:15.629
Thank you.

45:16.004 --> 45:18.048
God's work. Um... [chuckles]

45:19.925 --> 45:23.470
I went down to DC to get arrested.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.432
The different news outlets wrote about it.

45:26.515 --> 45:28.058
Like, "Schumer's been detained,"

45:28.142 --> 45:31.353
like I was just on a walking tour
of the Washington Monument.

45:34.022 --> 45:37.985
But I went down there to oppose
Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.

45:38.068 --> 45:41.447
[crowd cheers]

45:41.530 --> 45:43.115
Thank you, sisters.

45:44.450 --> 45:46.285
Men, you can clap too.

45:47.077 --> 45:48.829
[cheering, applause]

45:49.538 --> 45:52.416
Spoiler alert. It didn't go our way.

45:52.791 --> 45:54.293
[laughter]

45:55.586 --> 45:58.756
The whole way down, I was really nervous
about getting arrested.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.425
I've been arrested before,
obviously, but...

46:01.842 --> 46:03.010
[laughter]

46:03.969 --> 46:08.015
But I was obsessed
with the fear of being hungry.

46:08.515 --> 46:09.600
[laughter]

46:09.683 --> 46:12.186
You know, while I was locked up. So...

46:12.644 --> 46:15.105
It probably would have been like that
before I was pregnant,

46:15.189 --> 46:17.691
but that just doubled it,
so the whole way down...

46:18.442 --> 46:20.903
And, you know, we get down there, and...

46:21.278 --> 46:23.906
it was really intense 
and really emotional, and...

46:24.656 --> 46:26.492
We were gonna get arrested
on the Capitol steps,

46:26.575 --> 46:29.578
but they barricaded those,
so we all rush into the Hart Building,

46:29.661 --> 46:31.205
where the senators' offices are,

46:31.288 --> 46:32.664
and we all flood in this hallway,

46:32.748 --> 46:36.710
and, you know, the banners are flying
and the Capitol police are closing in,

46:36.794 --> 46:39.963
and we know we're about to be arrested,
and everyone's chanting,

46:40.047 --> 46:41.215
"No justice, no peace,"

46:41.298 --> 46:44.927
and, "We believe survivors.
We believe survivors."

46:45.719 --> 46:48.847
And I know we're about to be arrested,
so I am...

46:48.931 --> 46:51.558
ramming snacks in my mouth. I am...

46:51.892 --> 46:53.685
[shouting]

46:54.812 --> 46:57.773
Everyone's, "We Believe,"
and I'm... [screams]

46:58.190 --> 47:01.401
And the Capitol police are looking at me
like, "What the fuck?" I'm like...

47:01.485 --> 47:03.070
[screams]

47:03.153 --> 47:05.614
Just Cookie Monster,
crumbling shit on my face.

47:07.366 --> 47:10.536
I got arrested with my friend,
Emily Ratajkowski, who's a supermodel,

47:10.619 --> 47:15.123
like gorgeous, you know. And she's
in this hot outfit, and she's like,

47:15.207 --> 47:16.667
"We believe survivors,"

47:16.750 --> 47:20.462
and I'm in a Department of Sanitation
shirt, and I'm like...

47:20.546 --> 47:22.381
[screams] "Ahh!"

47:22.464 --> 47:23.382
[laughter]

47:26.051 --> 47:27.553
And some people criticized me.

47:27.636 --> 47:30.305
They were like,
"That was irresponsible. You're pregnant."

47:30.389 --> 47:32.349
And I was like,
"That's why I went down there."

47:32.432 --> 47:35.727
I want to be able to tell this kid
I did everything I could.

47:36.854 --> 47:37.938
You know?

47:38.021 --> 47:40.107
[cheering and applause]

47:40.190 --> 47:43.235
And D.C., I heard,
has the best cocaine, so...

47:45.863 --> 47:48.574
My friend said it's fine. Uh...

47:51.535 --> 47:52.744
A baby.

47:53.287 --> 47:54.121
Guys,

47:54.204 --> 47:56.373
what the fuck am I doing?

47:56.874 --> 47:58.041
[laughter]

47:59.084 --> 48:00.794
We have no idea what we're doing.

48:01.336 --> 48:05.549
We have some books at home,
and every week, there's a terrifying video

48:05.632 --> 48:08.135
saying what's going on
in the baby's development.

48:08.218 --> 48:09.636
"This week,

48:09.720 --> 48:13.974
your baby is growing fur
and eating you from the inside."

48:14.224 --> 48:15.392
[laughter]

48:16.852 --> 48:21.315
I'm glad I found a good partner, you know?
Like, he's solid as hell.

48:21.398 --> 48:25.027
Yeah. I just-- I didn't have the energy
for dating anymore, like...

48:25.110 --> 48:27.487
Remember when you hook up with someone
the first time?

48:27.571 --> 48:30.824
Do you remember
you used to undress each other?

48:32.075 --> 48:34.995
Know what I'm talking about?
They do that in movies. So you're like...

48:35.078 --> 48:37.080
[imitating kissing]

48:38.040 --> 48:39.750
[laughter]

48:40.417 --> 48:43.086
It's always hard. In movies...

48:43.170 --> 48:47.049
But you're like, okay, a braided belt,
and there is the silver thing.

48:47.215 --> 48:48.342
[laughter]

48:48.425 --> 48:50.510
And then, oh, a button fly.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.471
I'll just kind of yank it.

48:53.180 --> 48:56.975
And your sock. Am I in fucking retail?
Take your own shit off.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.019
My back hurts.

48:59.102 --> 49:00.270
[laughter]

49:05.108 --> 49:07.694
I was in bed with my husband 
the other night.

49:07.778 --> 49:12.074
I was holding our dog,
and my husband just took off my underwear.

49:12.824 --> 49:14.534
And I looked over at him and I was like,

49:15.494 --> 49:17.579
"Oh, no."

49:17.663 --> 49:19.665
[laughter]

49:20.832 --> 49:22.542
That's crazy, you know.

49:24.336 --> 49:25.587
He was kind of like,

49:25.671 --> 49:28.340
"Okay." Like he didn't give a shit
too much, you know.

49:29.716 --> 49:31.635
And we're lying there, and I'm like...

49:32.344 --> 49:34.429
"Can you put my underwear back on?"

49:34.721 --> 49:35.889
[laughter]

49:37.516 --> 49:41.728
Such sad foreshadowing watching him,
like, dress my lifeless body.

49:42.062 --> 49:43.397
[laughter]

49:49.152 --> 49:51.530
We were at the gynecologist
a couple months ago,

49:52.155 --> 49:56.284
and I asked, "Is it safe to have sex
while pregnant?" And she was like,

49:56.785 --> 50:00.622
"Yes, it is safe to have sex
through the whole pregnancy."

50:00.706 --> 50:01.581
And I was like,

50:02.249 --> 50:04.459
"We'll be seeking a second opinion."

50:04.584 --> 50:05.752
[laughter]

50:09.631 --> 50:10.966
That's fucking...

50:14.052 --> 50:16.096
I was trying to signal her, you know.

50:17.055 --> 50:18.181
"Hey.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.100
Do you think it's safe...

50:21.268 --> 50:22.978
[laughter]

50:24.688 --> 50:26.773
for us to have sex?

50:27.149 --> 50:29.735
[silently mouths]

50:30.777 --> 50:33.697
Do you think it would probably kill
the baby and we shouldn't do it?"

50:33.989 --> 50:35.157
[laughter]

50:37.993 --> 50:41.079
She's like,
"No, it's safe the whole time."

50:41.163 --> 50:43.331
I was like, "Okay. Okay."

50:44.583 --> 50:45.959
[laughter]

50:46.043 --> 50:49.588
Do you want me to come to your house
to tell your husband he can fuck you?

50:49.671 --> 50:50.672
[laughter]

50:54.342 --> 50:56.553
'Cause people tell you.
You're like, wow, that was fast.

50:56.636 --> 50:58.430
"Last time we saw you,
you were single, Amy,

50:58.513 --> 51:00.891
and you already 
don't want to fuck your husband?"

51:00.974 --> 51:02.142
[laughter]

51:02.434 --> 51:05.187
I usually do, but I have hyperemesis.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.523
And you know everyone says,
"When you get married,

51:08.607 --> 51:10.692
get ready to stop having sex."

51:11.318 --> 51:12.652
And we were like, "Not us.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.697
We're fucking for life," you know.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.407
[laughter]

51:19.117 --> 51:22.370
Now he, like, touches my shoulder
on the couch, and I'm like,

51:22.454 --> 51:23.872
"Can I help you?

51:23.955 --> 51:26.333
[laughter and applause]

51:31.296 --> 51:33.256
I'm over here. You're over there."

51:33.590 --> 51:35.634
[laughter]

51:40.847 --> 51:42.599
The spontaneity is over.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.142
Thank God.

51:44.226 --> 51:46.228
You know,
when you're first falling in love,

51:46.311 --> 51:48.772
like you might always have sex.

51:48.855 --> 51:49.773
Every time you pee,

51:49.856 --> 51:52.442
you've gotta make sure you clean
the toilet paper out of your pussy.

51:52.526 --> 51:53.568
Every time you pee.

51:53.652 --> 51:55.028
[laughter]

51:55.862 --> 51:56.738
Every time.

52:04.246 --> 52:07.916
That is over. I have, like,
half a roll of Charmin in there right now.

52:07.999 --> 52:09.668
[laughter]

52:09.751 --> 52:10.836
Yeah.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.295
[scoffs]

52:15.340 --> 52:17.717
I'm psyched to be done. I am.

52:17.801 --> 52:19.845
Especially dating someone new, you know.

52:19.928 --> 52:23.390
And I'm glad I married someone,
he's my age. We're the same age, so...

52:24.057 --> 52:26.893
You know, we both grew up
without Internet porn.

52:27.936 --> 52:29.271
That's a huge deal, right?

52:29.354 --> 52:30.814
Like, you know,

52:30.897 --> 52:33.733
now I feel like you can't
fuck a millennial without them being like,

52:33.817 --> 52:36.903
"Can you dress like an emoji?"
You're like, "No!"

52:37.779 --> 52:39.030
What the fuck?

52:39.114 --> 52:40.407
[laughter]

52:43.076 --> 52:43.952
No.

52:44.035 --> 52:46.788
And there's so many
different types of porn. It's crazy.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.834
One of the biggest searches is "gag porn."

52:51.501 --> 52:52.836
Have you heard of that?

52:52.919 --> 52:55.505
That's where the girl gags
on the guy's penis

52:55.589 --> 52:57.132
because it's too darn big.

52:57.215 --> 52:58.675
[laughter]

52:59.259 --> 53:00.927
I personally never had the plesh.

53:01.428 --> 53:03.096
[laughter]

53:06.474 --> 53:09.561
I just wanted to remind you that I've
never struggled with it, even though--

53:09.644 --> 53:11.396
You remember the size of my mouth, right?

53:11.479 --> 53:13.023
Do you remember how big my mouth is?

53:13.106 --> 53:16.193
[laughter and applause]

53:18.695 --> 53:20.780
Just like a tiny bow. You could put...

53:22.782 --> 53:24.868
Okay, yeah. You remember.

53:27.245 --> 53:29.080
Gag porn. Like that one...

53:29.164 --> 53:30.874
That one is strange to me.

53:30.957 --> 53:33.668
Like you're clicking
on all these different windows.

53:33.752 --> 53:35.879
Nothing, nothing.
And then a girl's like...

53:35.962 --> 53:39.257
[retches] And you're like,
"Mmm, wait a minute. [laughs]

53:39.341 --> 53:40.592
[laughter]

53:41.760 --> 53:43.261
What have we here?"

53:44.888 --> 53:46.056
[retches]

53:47.390 --> 53:50.185
Maximize screen. "Okay. Okay."

53:52.312 --> 53:53.271
If you're into gag porn,

53:53.355 --> 53:55.607
you should've been living at my house
the last five months.

53:55.690 --> 53:56.983
You'd be hard as a rock.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.818
[laughter]

54:01.446 --> 54:03.907
Something else I won't miss,
and this is my PSA...

54:04.324 --> 54:05.450
to men.

54:06.451 --> 54:10.664
A lot of men don't really understand
how to put themselves inside you.

54:11.831 --> 54:13.750
Not really. Even missionary.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.127
They're-- You know, they're--

54:16.211 --> 54:18.255
It's the wrong hole, or not a hole.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.966
You're like,
"You have to use an existing hole, sir."

54:21.299 --> 54:22.717
[laughter]

54:24.094 --> 54:27.639
You're not going to confuse my body
into making a new hole.

54:28.014 --> 54:29.182
[laughter]

54:30.600 --> 54:32.018
But most guys can figure it out,

54:32.102 --> 54:35.855
but you really realize that 
they don't understand where our hole goes

54:35.939 --> 54:38.191
when they're behind you, right?

54:38.817 --> 54:40.652
'Cause during some sex,

54:41.319 --> 54:46.074
it's always I don't know whose suggestion
to not look at your face anymore.

54:46.408 --> 54:47.575
[laughter]

54:48.076 --> 54:50.620
"How about you turn around?" "Oh, okay."

54:52.831 --> 54:55.041
You look back over the shoulder,
they're like,

54:55.125 --> 54:56.543
"Nope!" You're like, "Okay.

54:56.626 --> 54:58.086
[laughter]

54:58.420 --> 54:59.421
I'll be here."

55:05.093 --> 55:08.430
That's when you know because 
there's a whole population of men

55:08.513 --> 55:12.559
who, once they get back there behind you,
they'll kneel back there

55:12.642 --> 55:14.144
and just wait.

55:16.271 --> 55:17.647
Dick in the wind.

55:17.981 --> 55:19.649
[laughter]

55:21.151 --> 55:22.694
And you're up here, like...

55:26.823 --> 55:29.075
"Uh... We're rolling."

55:29.451 --> 55:30.952
[laughter]

55:36.207 --> 55:39.252
And you realize
that he's waiting for you...

55:40.837 --> 55:43.214
who's on all fours...

55:43.381 --> 55:44.549
[laughter]

55:44.924 --> 55:46.885
...to reach back...

55:48.428 --> 55:50.555
and put him inside you.

55:51.222 --> 55:54.100
You're like, "Oh, you want me to--?

55:54.184 --> 55:55.769
Oh, Okay. Uh...

55:56.644 --> 55:57.771
Yeah.

55:57.854 --> 56:00.315
I'll just use my head as,
like, a kickstand, just...

56:00.732 --> 56:04.611
[laughter and applause]

56:08.323 --> 56:11.701
Yeah. No, it makes sense.
I have the better angle here.

56:15.455 --> 56:18.500
You want to back the garage
up to the car, is what...?"

56:18.583 --> 56:19.667
[laughter]

56:22.796 --> 56:23.713
Okay.

56:25.507 --> 56:29.928
Nope, it's fine. You've had a long day
making more money than me. Here I come."

56:30.011 --> 56:33.306
[cheering and applause]

56:44.442 --> 56:45.485
Luckily,

56:46.152 --> 56:48.279
my husband does not have that problem.

56:48.655 --> 56:49.823
[laughter]

56:50.407 --> 56:51.741
Because...

56:52.242 --> 56:53.701
of that joke.

56:54.119 --> 56:56.204
[laughter]

56:57.705 --> 57:00.250
[applause]

57:02.669 --> 57:05.505
I know I talk so much shit about, uh,

57:05.839 --> 57:09.676
my pregnancy, and it has not been easy,
but we're so fucking excited,

57:09.759 --> 57:13.263
and I do feel really lucky
that I was able to get pregnant.

57:14.556 --> 57:15.515
Yeah.

57:15.598 --> 57:18.643
[applause, whooping]

57:20.728 --> 57:21.729
So I...

57:22.647 --> 57:26.985
was single, you know,
most of my life, and felt pretty happy.

57:27.068 --> 57:31.739
I love my family and friends, and I feel
really satisfied with work, and...

57:32.449 --> 57:33.950
kind of had accepted that, you know?

57:34.033 --> 57:36.578
And then I just happened...

57:37.370 --> 57:41.166
to meet this guy,
and if you're out there and you're dating

57:41.249 --> 57:42.250
and you're just thinking,

57:42.333 --> 57:45.879
"Why can't I meet the right one?" It's not
that you haven't met the right one yet.

57:45.962 --> 57:47.422
I wish someone had told me this.

57:47.505 --> 57:50.383
It's not that you haven't met
the right one yet. It's just...

57:50.467 --> 57:51.676
that you have to wait...

57:52.427 --> 57:54.095
for them to get tired.

57:54.888 --> 57:56.764
[laughter]

57:58.224 --> 57:59.851
No one told me, right?

57:59.934 --> 58:03.188
Because men in their 20s and their 30s
are just running around.

58:03.271 --> 58:06.900
[groaning]

58:08.359 --> 58:09.486
[pants]

58:09.569 --> 58:11.571
[groaning continues]

58:12.572 --> 58:15.658
And then their late 30s,
they're like, "Oh, God!

58:16.034 --> 58:17.702
Phew. Oh, God!"

58:19.329 --> 58:21.498
And that's when you come along
and you go...

58:22.540 --> 58:23.541
"Come on."

58:23.958 --> 58:25.919
[laughter]

58:27.086 --> 58:30.715
[cheering and applause]

58:32.717 --> 58:35.929
And they're like, "Where are we going?"
And you're like...

58:37.055 --> 58:40.225
"We're going to sit on the couch
and watch Bravo till we die."

58:40.308 --> 58:41.976
[laughter]

58:42.519 --> 58:45.813
[cheering, applause]

58:48.525 --> 58:50.818
Thank you so much, Chicago.

58:51.653 --> 58:53.071
I love you.

58:53.154 --> 58:54.781
[cheering]

59:19.681 --> 59:22.058
I realized how ashamed I was of my period.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.103
[burps] Excuse me. The baby.

59:25.186 --> 59:26.479
[laughter]

59:27.647 --> 59:30.483
Right now, every fart's a gamble.

59:30.567 --> 59:31.776
[laughter]

59:32.902 --> 59:33.903
Fart roulette.

59:34.529 --> 59:35.697
[laughter]

59:37.865 --> 59:40.034
My money's on brown. Um...

59:40.118 --> 59:41.160
[laughter]

59:41.244 --> 59:43.955
So they're flashing a light that says
that I need to get some makeup

59:44.038 --> 59:46.457
because I'm sweating like a monster.
All right.

59:46.541 --> 59:50.336
You guys can only see
that I'm sweating here,

59:50.420 --> 59:53.089
but if there was a camera in my asshole...

59:53.172 --> 59:54.882
[laughter]

59:55.425 --> 59:57.885
This is all my hair I bought.

59:58.344 --> 59:59.721
[laughter]

1:00:00.430 --> 1:00:02.557
There are these two people
right in the front row here.

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:06.352
I'm not going to look at them,
but these two people. And like...

1:00:07.145 --> 1:00:09.897
They're, like, truly horrified
by everything I'm saying.

1:00:10.231 --> 1:00:11.733
[laughter]

1:00:13.359 --> 1:00:16.321
I'm like, "Did you guys think 
you were seeing Godspell?" Okay.

1:00:18.781 --> 1:00:21.326
I promise it's not going to get
any better, you guys.

1:00:21.409 --> 1:00:23.036
[laughter]
