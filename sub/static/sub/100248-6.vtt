00:33.166 --> 00:35.625
Which one do you prefer?
"Lovely"? "Gorgeous"?

00:36.666 --> 00:39.291
Is the whole metaphor landing,
or is it too cerebral?

00:39.875 --> 00:41.750
-It's been an hour.
- <i> ♪ Gorgeous... ♪</i>

00:41.833 --> 00:43.791
Let's get on
before the beast gets hungry again.

00:43.875 --> 00:46.833
-But we made a deal.
<i>-</i>We made a deal with a livin' witcher.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.625
No sense in hangin' around
to pay a dead one.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.041
<i>♪ Gorgeous garro-- ♪</i>

00:51.708 --> 00:54.166
-Bollocks! Oi! No. No, no, no! No!

00:54.250 --> 00:56.708
Aah! You stop-- stop that,
or I-- I'll, uh...

00:56.791 --> 00:57.791
Or you'll what?

00:58.375 --> 00:59.291
Sing us to death?

01:00.083 --> 01:01.750
Perhaps you did not hear the man.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.666
Yeah! Perhaps you didn't...

01:03.750 --> 01:05.041
Di-- Sorry, who are you?

01:05.833 --> 01:06.750
Move along,

01:07.208 --> 01:08.208
old man.

01:09.375 --> 01:12.458
Do as the bard asks
or I'll be forced to draw my weapons.

01:12.875 --> 01:13.916
What weapons?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.333
I see no steel 'ere.

01:16.416 --> 01:17.666
-Hm!

01:17.750 --> 01:20.208
-Oh!

01:20.625 --> 01:21.916
Steel won't be necessary.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.291
I believe those are mine.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.250
Geralt, they--  With the--

01:38.333 --> 01:40.416
This woman just killed a man
with her bare hands

01:40.500 --> 01:42.041
for trying to steal your horse.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.375
Maybe she'll make
a better travel companion, then.

01:45.458 --> 01:48.041
Uh, I'm sorry, who are you, exactly?

01:48.458 --> 01:50.791
I am Borch Three Jackdaws.

01:51.208 --> 01:53.916
These are my companions,
Téa and Véa.

01:55.291 --> 01:58.125
I've been looking for you,
Geralt of Rivia.

02:02.541 --> 02:05.291
This is a first for me,
and that's saying something.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.875
I've very few firsts left.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.916
But to dine with <i>the </i>Geralt of Rivia...

02:11.625 --> 02:13.125
Your adventures are legend.

02:13.208 --> 02:14.291
You're welcome.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.000
Est Est, small.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.416
I suppose you want me to tell you
why I've sought out

02:18.500 --> 02:20.416
such an accomplished monster hunter.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.500
-Don't trouble yourself on my account.

02:22.583 --> 02:25.208
- I just want food.
-I knew I'd like you.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.625
That was the first reason.

02:27.416 --> 02:30.416
One of everything you have.
And keep the ale coming!

02:30.500 --> 02:31.666
On its way!

02:33.416 --> 02:35.041
The second one is this.

02:35.875 --> 02:36.875
A short while ago,

02:36.958 --> 02:41.625
a green dragon landed across the border
in King Niedamir's mountains.

02:43.375 --> 02:44.541
I know what you're thinking.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.166
"Impossible, dragons are so rare."

02:48.875 --> 02:49.708
But it's true.

02:50.583 --> 02:53.708
Locals spotted it
and went after it in search of treasure.

02:53.791 --> 02:56.791
Of course, they succeeded only
in wounding the creature

02:56.875 --> 02:58.708
and angering it so righteously

02:58.791 --> 03:01.958
that it swooped down from its lair
and set half a hillside ablaze.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.375
-Hm.
- Dead sheep everywhere.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.125
You have the most incredible neck.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.875
-It's like a... a sexy goose.

03:09.958 --> 03:11.291
Ugh.

03:12.041 --> 03:13.166
Gu-- guzzling.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.125
Now, the King is in a bind.

03:15.458 --> 03:19.291
He's set to marry the princess
of his rival kingdom, Malleore,

03:19.375 --> 03:20.750
which means it's bad timing

03:20.833 --> 03:23.583
to have a murderous pest lurking about
in the mountains.

03:24.333 --> 03:26.750
He's commissioned a hunt to kill it.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.208
Four teams have signed on.

03:29.666 --> 03:31.750
The winner gets the dragon treasure hoard

03:31.833 --> 03:35.375
plus the title of lord
over one of his new vassal states.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.333
That is... if he survives.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.458
What does this have to do with me?

03:43.375 --> 03:45.291
I want you to join my team.

03:57.916 --> 03:59.291
I can hear it now,

03:59.375 --> 04:01.458
a tale of two Zerrikanians

04:01.541 --> 04:04.333
and their valiant poet lover.

04:04.416 --> 04:07.291
Oh!
We're so doing this. We're in.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.208
You've wasted your breath, Borch.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.583
I don't kill dragons.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.208
Take my advice.

04:15.791 --> 04:18.083
No treasure is worth dying for.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.291
Depends on the treasure.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.958
What I need is...

04:25.875 --> 04:27.083
a new adventure.

04:27.916 --> 04:31.666
One final first before I'm too old
to do anything but die.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.500
You think killing a dragon
will bring you that?

04:36.583 --> 04:39.000
All I know is there's one path
up the mountain,

04:39.083 --> 04:41.250
and it's overrun with monsters.

04:41.333 --> 04:44.833
With you on my team, dear Witcher,
we'll be unstoppable.

04:45.666 --> 04:48.000
- Someone get me a fuckin' drink!

04:49.333 --> 04:51.958
-Barman!
-Those dwarfs will be part of the hunt.

04:52.791 --> 04:53.708
Barman.

04:53.791 --> 04:56.541
-Geralt could handle them in his sleep.
-Fuckin' right!

04:58.000 --> 05:01.041
He said he wants four fuckin' pints!

05:02.000 --> 05:04.375
-Now.
-Or maybe a little bit awake.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.458
Then there are the Reavers.

05:08.916 --> 05:10.541
Have you heard of them, Witcher?

05:10.625 --> 05:11.500
Yes.

05:13.583 --> 05:15.083
And the answer is no.

05:16.791 --> 05:19.041
You feel it just the same as me...

05:19.708 --> 05:21.250
that hole inside you.

05:21.916 --> 05:24.916
That itch that can't be scratched
that burns your brain,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.500
keeps you awake at night.

05:28.125 --> 05:28.958
Come with me.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.583
I'll show you what you're missing.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.333
What am I missing?

05:37.375 --> 05:40.458
Sorry to interrupt this lovely moment...
That's only three.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.708
Where's the-- What's the fourth team?

05:44.125 --> 05:45.416
- Hm.
-Them.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.875
Oh!

05:49.958 --> 05:52.208
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Oh, no, no, no.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.750
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Thank you so much. It's been very nice.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.833
Thank you for the wine and the pies,

05:56.916 --> 05:58.833
but as the man said,
we really can't get involved.

05:58.916 --> 06:00.000
Geralt, shall we?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.000
-I'm in.
-Mother of...

06:03.750 --> 06:06.083
The hunt begins at sunrise.

06:23.166 --> 06:26.208
Your man might've mentioned
that the road was too narrow for horses

06:26.291 --> 06:27.791
in his initial sales pitch.

06:28.416 --> 06:30.041
Welcome to the world, Jaskier.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.083
Damn it to Korath!

06:32.833 --> 06:33.916
What's got your goat?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.458
Someone's stolen my pack.

06:35.833 --> 06:37.541
Probably those fuckin' Reavers!

06:41.375 --> 06:42.375
Aye, well...

06:42.916 --> 06:45.375
three days' journey
and only one route to the top.

06:45.750 --> 06:49.291
Leaves plenty of time
for me to piss in his gruel!

06:51.958 --> 06:52.958
Aah.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.291
Name's Yarpen Zigrin.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.166
Geralt of Rivia.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.458
-And my name is Julian Alfred Pankratz--
-Aye. I know.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.708
You'll fetch a goodly amount for that mare
if you sell now!

07:12.083 --> 07:15.541
Charming how everyone wants to get
their hands on Roach these days, isn't it?

07:15.625 --> 07:17.416
He means we won't make it out alive.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.791
Wait, what? No one mentioned anything
about impending death!

07:20.875 --> 07:24.083
How is it
that I've walked this earth for decades

07:24.166 --> 07:25.791
without coming across a witcher,

07:26.291 --> 07:28.791
and then the first one I meet,
I can't get rid of?

07:28.875 --> 07:30.625
I'd say
something strange was afoot,

07:30.708 --> 07:33.875
but then again, witchers are bound
to bump into monsters eventually.

07:35.708 --> 07:37.458
-Jaskier.
- Yennefer.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.208
The crow's feet are new.

07:40.416 --> 07:41.875
Yeah, well, your jokes are...

07:43.708 --> 07:44.541
old.

07:49.708 --> 07:50.708
Thanks, Roach.

07:52.666 --> 07:55.541
-What are you doing here, Yen?
- I'm here with my escort.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.541
Noble Sir Eyck of Denesle.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.375
To assist him in killing the dragon.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.166
For kingdom and glory!

08:07.375 --> 08:08.750
Till we meet again, Geralt.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.166
See you, Roach.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.750
Who is Geralt, exactly?

08:56.666 --> 08:58.416
Did my grandmother know him well?

08:58.500 --> 09:02.250
Why did she never mention him
to me before... that night?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.833
Protecting you has always been
our primary purpose.

09:04.916 --> 09:07.125
Why'd she let him claim
the Law of Surprise?

09:07.916 --> 09:09.208
What's that even mean?

09:09.291 --> 09:11.708
When one has saved another
from certain death,

09:12.125 --> 09:14.416
the Law of Surprise can be claimed

09:14.916 --> 09:16.000
to pay that debt.

09:16.541 --> 09:17.583
Who did Geralt save?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.333
Your father.

09:22.041 --> 09:24.583
Duny. In payment, he bound you to Geralt.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.208
-It's your destiny.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.916
Then why hasn't he found me yet?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.458
Questions, questions.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.000
You'll be together soon.

09:38.666 --> 09:40.708
Exactly as your grandmother wished.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.208
Make haste, children.

10:19.333 --> 10:22.375
It is so kind of you
to share the spoils of this expedition

10:22.458 --> 10:23.958
with an old man such as Borch.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.708
You're like two fiercely loyal...

10:28.416 --> 10:29.666
uh, friends.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.458
I wanna say friends. Relatives.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.333
Contract security.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.750
To hunt with him is an honor
unsullied by payment.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.333
But why?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.916
He is the most beautiful.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.125
You worry if you blink,
you'll never see her again.

10:55.666 --> 10:56.916
You're in love with her.

10:57.750 --> 10:58.666
Or...

10:59.375 --> 11:01.416
the danger here isn't the dragon.

11:02.041 --> 11:04.708
That's why I brought you along,
Geralt of Rivia.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.208
Nothing scares you.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.291
Huh.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.666
Then you don't know
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.500
May she be the worst encounter, then.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.625
Melitele preserve us.

11:24.791 --> 11:26.041
What happened here?

11:30.250 --> 11:32.041
Dragons avoid people.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.166
It should have left when they attacked.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.083
I don't get it. Why the retaliation?

11:38.458 --> 11:41.041
When your species is
on the verge of collapse,

11:41.708 --> 11:43.958
perhaps everything becomes more desperate.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.708
Yeah, I mean, you can use twigs,

11:52.250 --> 11:54.125
uh, but I-- I mean, I personally prefer...

11:54.583 --> 11:55.791
using flowers, you know?

11:56.208 --> 11:57.166
Roses.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.375
Daffodils.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.625
-Flora and, yikes, fauna.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.083
A cactus, if she's really into it.

12:02.708 --> 12:04.333
Ladies, you look famished.

12:04.416 --> 12:07.291
Allow me to wander aimlessly
into this thicket

12:07.375 --> 12:10.000
and retrieve for you, uh...

12:10.083 --> 12:12.625
a tasty afternoon treat.

12:13.416 --> 12:14.708
Uh... uh...

12:15.166 --> 12:16.333
Right. Hm.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.500
-I am hungry. Anyone else hungry?

12:19.083 --> 12:20.875
I could genuinely eat a...

12:22.125 --> 12:23.166
Okay.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.000
There's something back here.

12:34.541 --> 12:36.166
It sort of looks like a faun.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.833
-Jaskier...
- Hello.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.000
-Hello, little fellow.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.416
Aw! Aren't you just the cutest...

12:45.125 --> 12:46.750
Most...

12:46.833 --> 12:48.916
terrifying thing I've ever seen
in my entire life.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.458
Right, run away! Run away! Geralt!

12:53.791 --> 12:55.583
It's one of your... friends again.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.125
-What in the name of Bloemenmagde is that?
- It's an hirikka.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.583
It's probably starving.
Sheathe your weapons.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.416
-For kingdom and glory!
-Sir Eyck!

13:31.333 --> 13:32.500
Yeah...

13:32.583 --> 13:34.000
You could have been killed!

13:38.833 --> 13:41.416
If we'd fed it, it would've gone away.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.333
Thanks.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.708
That knight may be a fuckin' dumbbell,

13:44.791 --> 13:47.500
but I'll be damned,
the dragon won't stand a chance.

13:59.666 --> 14:02.583
Um...
I'm not sure I'd eat that, good sir.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.625
Knights never waste a kill.

14:07.916 --> 14:11.000
It's precisely why I'll make a great lord
to Niedamir's vassal state.

14:12.041 --> 14:14.166
A great knight must lead by example.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.416
-For--
-Kingdom and glory.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.083
We know.

14:18.166 --> 14:21.333
My subjects will be the luckiest serfs
in all the lands.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.666
Especially with the beautiful Yennefer
as my mage.

14:25.041 --> 14:28.041
I cannot wait to serve you, My Lord.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.166
How would you like to serve me tonight...

14:34.166 --> 14:36.083
-Witch?
-Careful, Boholt.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.750
So, the Witcher wants
to play knight too, hmm?

14:41.833 --> 14:42.958
No.

14:43.458 --> 14:46.375
She's plenty able
of murdering you herself.

14:48.291 --> 14:51.666
What's so amusin',
you overgrown cock hair?

14:51.750 --> 14:54.083
I'm just wondering who I will kill first.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.500
The monster,

14:58.375 --> 14:59.916
or the monster hunter.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.541
Hm.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.875
Oh, dear.

15:12.708 --> 15:15.666
Um... I'm afraid I must take my leave.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.916
Lady Yennefer,
may I escort you to your tent?

15:18.375 --> 15:19.375
Will you be joining me?

15:20.208 --> 15:22.458
-Uh... My Lady, I would...

15:22.541 --> 15:24.250
...never degrade your honor
in such a way.

15:24.333 --> 15:27.500
I hate to break it to you,
but that ship has sailed,

15:27.583 --> 15:29.541
wrecked and sunk to the bottom
of the ocean.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.458
Ow.

15:30.541 --> 15:32.291
-Oh...

15:33.083 --> 15:35.333
I need a shit.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.541
So, shall we tell
the poor bastard

15:44.625 --> 15:47.791
that he's vying for a vassal state
that won't exist in a decade?

15:47.875 --> 15:50.208
States rise and fall like the tide.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.083
Nothing new.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.333
This is fuckin' new!

15:55.000 --> 15:57.750
The rightful son of Nilfgaard
has returned, burnin' through the south.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.416
With Fringilla as his mage.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.916
Nilfgaard's a joke.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.875
I saw it with my own eyes
down in Ebbing.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.541
Those zealot freaks are inching closer
by the day.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.000
Won't be long till they try
and take Sodden.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.500
Next it'll be Temeria.

16:13.125 --> 16:13.958
Redania.

16:14.750 --> 16:15.833
-Cintra.
-No.

16:17.125 --> 16:19.500
Queen Calanthe would die
before letting them take what's hers.

16:22.083 --> 16:25.916
Perhaps if Nilfgaard's religious zeal
had been tempered earlier

16:26.000 --> 16:27.833
by a stronger hand...

16:33.125 --> 16:34.250
If you'll excuse me,

16:35.541 --> 16:36.916
I must get my beauty sleep.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.291
I don't think it'll make me prettier,

16:42.958 --> 16:44.000
but I need sleep too.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.291
So... we're all about to have
new evil overlords,

16:52.375 --> 16:55.833
and dragons are, in fact, a thing.

16:56.208 --> 16:59.125
-Good day all round.

16:59.791 --> 17:01.916
Oh, you've all seen
a dragon before, have you?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.333
Geralt, will you please tell them?

17:04.333 --> 17:05.916
Their numbers are dwindling.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.708
Treasure seekers saw to that.
But they do exist.

17:10.791 --> 17:13.375
What people call "green dragons,"

17:13.916 --> 17:15.250
like the one we have here,

17:16.125 --> 17:17.333
they're the most common.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.125
Red dragons, less so.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.833
Black dragons are the rarest.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.208
Gold dragons are rarest.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.250
Gold dragons are a myth.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.291
For a gold dragon to exist,

17:30.375 --> 17:33.583
it would... have to be the result of...

17:34.250 --> 17:36.791
an accidental, unique mutation.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.166
And in <i>my</i> experience,

17:39.958 --> 17:42.333
mutations, they're intentional.

17:42.958 --> 17:44.250
But it doesn't matter.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.375
Mutant or myth,

17:45.458 --> 17:49.125
gold dragons met the same fate
as anything too different to endure.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.333
They died out.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.333
There are other ways of enduring.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.958
If it's legacy you're after,

18:00.041 --> 18:03.833
perhaps you should take the overgrown
cock hair's advice and become a knight.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.458
Sir Witcher...

18:07.166 --> 18:08.250
the White-Haired...

18:08.833 --> 18:09.833
of Rivia.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.541
You'd make a rather shitty one,
refusing to slay dragons.

18:17.333 --> 18:21.166
But probably not as shitty a one
as Sir Eyck of Denesle!

18:27.708 --> 18:31.291
Keep walking.
The Nilfgaardians could be anywhere.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.541
We're not safe yet.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.833
How did you escape the attack,
Mousesack?

18:34.916 --> 18:36.041
Dara, please.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.375
Ciri says you vanished into thin air.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.500
Why did you abandon your Princess?

18:41.083 --> 18:41.916
We were...

18:43.416 --> 18:46.125
I was pulled through a portal
by Nilfgaard,

18:46.791 --> 18:48.916
kidnapped and held prisoner for days.

18:49.541 --> 18:50.875
And how did you escape them?

18:51.791 --> 18:52.625
Geralt.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.000
He sent me to get Ciri.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.000
The Witcher?

18:57.500 --> 18:59.875
Trained to fight and bound to Ciri.

19:01.125 --> 19:04.333
And he rescued you
so you could then rescue her?

19:05.583 --> 19:07.250
-Alone?
-Ask him yourself.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.666
He's in a town

19:11.500 --> 19:13.333
just past this thicket of trees.

19:14.791 --> 19:16.083
We must find him.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.041
To safety.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.875
Something's off about this, Ciri.

19:21.958 --> 19:24.083
-The waters there were--
-Yes, they've worn off,

19:24.166 --> 19:25.875
which means I'm thinking straight.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.291
Do you know what happens to people
who escape a siege?

19:29.375 --> 19:31.000
Because they don't just vanish.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.166
They get captured and they get turned.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.041
Remember what the Dryad Queen said.

19:36.583 --> 19:38.333
-"Ask the right questions."

19:38.833 --> 19:41.833
It's not just your life, Ciri.
It's mine too.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.125
Princess, I forgot.

19:46.958 --> 19:48.125
I brought this for you.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.333
My grandmother's sash.

20:19.958 --> 20:21.291
Has anyone seen my escort?

20:23.541 --> 20:25.666
Ah! Bloody ball sacks!

20:34.500 --> 20:37.375
Who slits a man's throat
while he's relieving his bowels?

20:38.708 --> 20:40.041
Is nothing sacred anymore?

20:40.833 --> 20:41.958
Ugh.

20:42.791 --> 20:43.791
Fuck!

20:48.916 --> 20:52.208
We're halfway to the dragon's lair,
but it's getting dangerous.

20:52.791 --> 20:56.041
-We cannot continue like this.
- The warrior woman is right.

20:56.125 --> 20:58.291
Someone killed that self-righteous fud,

20:58.375 --> 20:59.708
and it wasn't any of us.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.916
Somebody's not playin' fair.

21:03.125 --> 21:05.166
Our people used to mine these mountains.

21:05.583 --> 21:08.166
We know a shortcut
that will cut half a day off our journey.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.333
Let the Reavers take the long way around.

21:10.416 --> 21:13.333
We'll nab the treasure
before they even set foot in the cave.

21:13.416 --> 21:15.875
We'll watch each other's backs
until we reach the next peak,

21:16.250 --> 21:17.625
then every man for himself.

21:18.541 --> 21:20.375
-What say ye?
-Let's go.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.666
Aah!

21:24.125 --> 21:25.666
Go on. I'll catch up.

21:36.416 --> 21:37.458
Did you kill Eyck?

21:38.083 --> 21:38.916
Kill him?

21:39.375 --> 21:40.625
That's rather pedestrian.

21:41.208 --> 21:44.208
And you're the one who's been
staring daggers at him since we arrived.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.291
It was the Reavers.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.958
That bastard Boholt killed my escort

21:51.041 --> 21:54.541
before he could accomplish the one
damn task I actually needed him for.

21:54.625 --> 21:55.625
And what was that?

21:56.875 --> 21:57.708
Yen!

21:59.916 --> 22:01.500
What are you really doing here?

22:02.750 --> 22:04.000
I'm here for the dragon.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.833
There are certain healing properties
it's rumored to possess.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.583
I thought your transformation

22:14.958 --> 22:16.250
healed all parts of you?

22:17.416 --> 22:19.125
At the cost of losing others, yes.

22:20.458 --> 22:21.458
Yennefer...

22:22.750 --> 22:25.041
do not tell me
you've traveled all this way

22:25.625 --> 22:28.541
for made-up fertility cures
using fresh dragon hearts?

22:28.625 --> 22:30.208
-They're not made up!
-They are.

22:30.666 --> 22:31.875
And seriously?

22:31.958 --> 22:33.958
You, a mother?

22:34.041 --> 22:35.500
Do you think I'd make a bad one?

22:37.375 --> 22:38.416
Definitely.

22:43.625 --> 22:44.458
Yen...

22:46.666 --> 22:49.666
A child? What could you possibly want
with a child?

22:49.750 --> 22:52.333
They took my choice. I want it back.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.125
Not that I'd expect you to understand.

22:57.708 --> 22:59.708
I didn't choose to become a witcher.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.000
Listen...

23:04.916 --> 23:06.208
the people who made us,

23:06.958 --> 23:09.166
they made us sterile for a lot of reasons.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.541
One of the kinder ones

23:12.000 --> 23:14.916
is because this lifestyle isn't suited
to a child.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.083
What?

23:20.958 --> 23:23.041
You were going to summon chaos
on kings' orders

23:23.125 --> 23:24.333
in between feeding and naps?

23:24.416 --> 23:26.916
-Do not patronize me!
-I'm not.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.500
I've thought about this. Often.

23:30.250 --> 23:32.375
And I'd rather use
my Child Surprise as bruxa bait

23:32.458 --> 23:34.416
than subject it to this life!

23:34.500 --> 23:35.875
What did you just say?

23:36.666 --> 23:37.708
Uh...

23:38.208 --> 23:39.708
Ah, fuck!

23:41.208 --> 23:42.625
You have a Child Surprise?

23:46.625 --> 23:48.125
Isn't that rich?

23:48.208 --> 23:50.958
You lecture me on made-up cures
for having a child,

23:51.833 --> 23:53.958
meanwhile you cheat with destiny
to steal one.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.083
Every time I'm near you,

23:58.875 --> 24:01.416
I say more in five minutes
than I've said in weeks.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.000
And I always regret it.

24:13.958 --> 24:15.041
The dwarfs,

24:16.250 --> 24:18.458
they're leading us to a shorter path.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.583
Come along.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.000
I can take care of myself.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.666
You don't always have to.

24:30.166 --> 24:31.166
Come with me.

24:42.375 --> 24:43.833
He's waiting for us.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.166
Did you ever stop missing Skellige?

24:53.500 --> 24:54.625
What?

24:54.708 --> 24:57.791
It's just that I don't think
I'll ever stop missing Cintra, but...

24:58.458 --> 25:02.000
you left your home to come raise me,
how did you feel about that?

25:03.375 --> 25:04.208
I was...

25:06.083 --> 25:07.125
very homesick.

25:10.916 --> 25:12.250
Remember when we'd visit?

25:12.875 --> 25:14.541
Ice skating with Crach an Craite?

25:15.833 --> 25:18.416
He always said he let me win,
but I was just faster.

25:19.791 --> 25:22.166
-Did you miss the cold too?
-Yes, very much.

25:24.125 --> 25:26.041
-Except you have arthritis!

25:26.125 --> 25:27.708
You hate the cold!

25:27.791 --> 25:29.875
And you always said Skellige
was where you came from

25:29.958 --> 25:32.083
but Cintra was your home, with us!

25:32.583 --> 25:34.000
-Hey!
-I've had enough of you.

25:34.083 --> 25:37.458
-Mousesack, stop!
-Our name is not Mousesack!

25:37.958 --> 25:39.875
We killed Mousesack

25:40.375 --> 25:42.750
-and took his disgusting form...

25:42.833 --> 25:45.000
-...to find you.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.958
We prefer it like this anyway.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.291
Where are you taking us?
Who wants her?

26:25.375 --> 26:28.500
-The man with the winged helmet.
-Why is he going to so much trouble?

26:28.583 --> 26:32.083
I'm special. I don't know how or why,
but there's something inside me.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.125
-Kill him!
-What?

26:35.375 --> 26:36.375
Then I'll do it!

26:36.458 --> 26:37.750
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!

26:57.708 --> 27:00.166
Mind the scree fallin', hear me?

27:00.250 --> 27:02.541
Can get a bit rocky round here
if it's windy.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.125
Which...

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
it is.

27:12.000 --> 27:12.875
We're here.

27:13.583 --> 27:16.666
Yeah, you're right, this is a shortcut...
to death.

27:16.750 --> 27:18.583
You wanna beat those Reavers or not?

27:18.666 --> 27:20.833
-We should turn back.
-No.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.916
-We're very close.
-How can you possibly know that?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.250
'Tis a perfectly fine route.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.500
-For a dwarf.
-Aah!

27:27.000 --> 27:28.750
Stifle your mewlin'. You'll manage.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.375
As long as you don't look down.

27:36.958 --> 27:39.833
- See ya on the other side!
- Yeah, yeah, yes.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.666
-Uh...

27:44.750 --> 27:46.208
Uh, ladies first?

27:46.291 --> 27:48.000
Ah! All right. Yep.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.958
Come on, Jask. You've got this.

27:51.458 --> 27:53.458
-You've got this.
- Come on!

27:57.375 --> 27:58.208
Careful!

28:00.791 --> 28:01.916
Oh, whoa!

28:02.000 --> 28:03.708
Oh, fuck! Oh...

28:06.375 --> 28:08.166
Oh, that is not a good sign.

28:08.250 --> 28:09.958
That is not a good sign.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.625
Phew!

28:58.000 --> 28:59.875
- Okay...

29:04.375 --> 29:06.333
-Geralt!
-Get back!

29:09.000 --> 29:11.750
Sir Witcher, you will save us yet.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.375
But first, you must let go.

29:14.958 --> 29:15.875
No.

29:19.708 --> 29:22.333
-Geralt! The planks won't hold!

29:24.083 --> 29:25.083
Thank you.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.291
No!

30:28.500 --> 30:29.666
You did your best.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.208
There's nothing else you could have done.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.875
Look, why don't we leave tomorrow?

30:43.541 --> 30:46.625
That is, if you'll give me another chance
to prove myself a...

30:46.708 --> 30:48.250
worthy travel companion.

30:48.875 --> 30:49.916
Hm.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.875
We could head to the coast.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.125
Get away for a while.

30:59.166 --> 31:01.458
Sounds like something Borch would say,
doesn't it?

31:03.583 --> 31:04.583
Life is too short.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.375
Do what pleases you...

31:10.166 --> 31:11.166
while you can.

31:13.125 --> 31:14.875
Composing your next song?

31:17.041 --> 31:18.583
No, I'm just, uh...

31:21.291 --> 31:23.291
Just trying to work out what pleases me.

31:46.083 --> 31:46.958
Hm.

31:47.791 --> 31:49.291
So simple.

31:54.666 --> 31:56.416
-Do  you like it?

32:10.208 --> 32:11.708
Is this not what you came for?

32:15.208 --> 32:16.500
I came for you.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.291
I was afraid
that mountain would take you from me,

32:25.625 --> 32:27.916
but now I fear
it took your senses instead.

32:28.541 --> 32:29.833
Only my nonsense.

32:31.833 --> 32:33.416
I quite like your nonsense.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.583
Hm...

32:41.416 --> 32:42.625
That scent.

32:45.416 --> 32:48.000
<i>The moment I dread most</i>
<i>every time you leave...</i>

32:50.541 --> 32:51.833
<i>is when it fades.</i>

32:57.416 --> 32:58.750
When you're really gone.

33:01.416 --> 33:02.583
You left first.

33:03.791 --> 33:04.666
In Rinde.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.375
<i>I woke up in that destroyed house</i>
<i>and you were gone.</i>

33:15.375 --> 33:16.375
Forgive me.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.208
Do you hurt?

34:10.041 --> 34:11.500
I don't mean physical pain.

34:13.125 --> 34:15.333
They say
witchers can't feel human emotion.

34:18.208 --> 34:21.250
They say whatever justifies
despising our kind.

34:21.708 --> 34:22.708
Huh.

34:23.833 --> 34:25.041
Do you regret it?

34:26.041 --> 34:27.083
Becoming a witcher?

34:30.583 --> 34:33.166
It's hard to regret something
you didn't choose.

34:34.208 --> 34:35.875
But if the choice had been yours,

34:37.666 --> 34:39.375
what would you have done instead?

34:41.250 --> 34:42.250
A farmer?

34:44.958 --> 34:45.916
A stableman?

34:48.583 --> 34:50.458
-Horses are good company.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.500
But if I ever dreamed
of being something...

34:56.250 --> 34:58.666
other... than what I am...

35:02.333 --> 35:04.125
it was too long ago to remember.

35:06.250 --> 35:07.750
Did you dream of being a mage?

35:10.208 --> 35:12.250
I didn't have much of a choice either.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.416
Did you always want to become a mother?

35:25.875 --> 35:27.291
I dreamed...

35:29.041 --> 35:31.375
of becoming important to someone.

35:32.791 --> 35:33.833
Someday.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Hm.

35:38.416 --> 35:39.416
Do I bore you?

35:41.416 --> 35:43.125
Not at all.

35:46.125 --> 35:47.208
Before we met,

35:48.125 --> 35:49.250
the days were calm...

35:50.708 --> 35:52.250
and the nights were restless.

35:54.708 --> 35:56.500
But now...

36:00.583 --> 36:02.541
you're important to me.

37:23.166 --> 37:24.166
Good morning.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.833
Hm.

37:37.250 --> 37:40.916
At a quick pace, we can make it back
to the Pensive Dragon before sundown.

37:41.666 --> 37:43.916
What are you talking about?
We're almost at the top.

37:47.291 --> 37:49.166
I came here for a reason, Geralt.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.708
I'm not leaving
till I've killed that dragon.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.458
Yen, no!

37:54.166 --> 37:56.541
-What will it solve?
-It will solve everything.

37:58.833 --> 37:59.666
Wait.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.875
Where are those fucking dwarfs?

38:08.416 --> 38:09.250
Yen!

38:35.041 --> 38:35.916
Don't scream.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.000
I understand why you're afraid.

38:43.750 --> 38:46.958
If there had been any other way
to extract you, I'd have done it.

38:51.958 --> 38:54.458
It was never my intention
to torment you, Princess.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
All I want...

38:58.416 --> 39:02.000
all I've ever wanted is
to help you fulfill your destiny.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.416
The White Flame has brought us together.

39:07.625 --> 39:09.625
You are the key to everything, Cirilla.

39:17.833 --> 39:18.958
You must be starving.

39:21.458 --> 39:23.125
I'll get you something to eat.

39:53.750 --> 39:55.125
What have you done?

39:55.208 --> 39:56.500
You lied to us.

39:57.208 --> 39:59.083
You didn't tell us what she is.

39:59.166 --> 40:00.625
What she's capable of.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.375
You fucking fool!

40:15.708 --> 40:17.750
Uh-uh!

40:17.833 --> 40:19.208
We know all your tricks.

40:37.250 --> 40:40.083
Do you really believe all this nonsense
in your head?

40:40.166 --> 40:41.791
-This prophecy?

40:41.875 --> 40:43.250
We think you're insane!

40:54.375 --> 40:57.000
-You are an abomination!

40:57.500 --> 40:58.875
I will destroy you!

41:23.208 --> 41:25.166
You're still here, aren't you?

42:39.291 --> 42:40.583
No closer!

42:42.875 --> 42:43.875
What the fuck?

42:45.500 --> 42:47.125
Get back!

42:47.208 --> 42:49.041
You should've stayed dead.

42:50.291 --> 42:51.375
Stop!

42:56.625 --> 42:57.583
How?

43:01.541 --> 43:02.791
He's dead.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.458
<i>She's </i>dead.

43:29.708 --> 43:32.250
Sir Witcher and his sorceress.

43:34.750 --> 43:35.958
Hello again.

43:42.583 --> 43:43.791
Impossible.

43:44.416 --> 43:46.375
When the dragoness was injured,

43:46.958 --> 43:49.083
her cry was heard by Villentretenmerth.

43:49.416 --> 43:51.208
But the egg could not be moved

43:51.750 --> 43:53.583
or the life inside it would die.

43:53.666 --> 43:55.541
That's why the dragon attacked.

43:57.541 --> 43:59.250
She was protecting her baby.

44:01.375 --> 44:03.916
And then we heard
about the King's hunt,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.708
realized we had to keep our enemies close.

44:07.166 --> 44:08.916
So I came to find you,

44:09.583 --> 44:11.041
the white-haired witcher,

44:11.583 --> 44:15.208
the knight who was taught
to save dragons instead of kill them.

44:20.333 --> 44:22.666
Looks like
we get to fuck up the whole family.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.333
Slay that dragon!

44:28.666 --> 44:30.250
Kill them!

44:30.333 --> 44:31.416
Boholt's mine!

44:52.750 --> 44:53.875
<i>Aard, </i>now!

45:08.291 --> 45:10.000
I'm afraid we have more.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.500
Go! I'll protect the egg.

45:18.583 --> 45:19.583
Get them!

46:09.500 --> 46:11.875
So I get to kill you after all, Witcher.

46:26.625 --> 46:28.541
It's not going to happen!

46:52.208 --> 46:54.416
Shame you don't get to see me
crack that egg!

47:16.250 --> 47:17.458
Uh...

47:37.458 --> 47:38.375
Geralt?

47:40.416 --> 47:41.333
Dwarfs?

47:43.083 --> 47:44.791
Oh, gosh. Phew!

47:45.791 --> 47:46.916
Ah! What'd I miss?

47:47.416 --> 47:48.583
Huh?

47:49.208 --> 47:50.458
-Guys?

47:50.541 --> 47:52.791
Are we... queuing for something?

47:52.875 --> 47:54.291
-What's going on?

47:54.833 --> 47:55.833
Oh, no!

48:02.708 --> 48:03.708
Oh, fuck!

48:05.291 --> 48:06.500
What happened?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.458
Oh, gosh!

48:09.541 --> 48:10.958
Oh! Bloody hell.

48:11.041 --> 48:13.458
What the fuck are you doing here?

48:20.833 --> 48:24.208
Well, that's fuckin' shite!
We missed a whole mother lode of fun.

48:30.916 --> 48:35.583
Ask no questions, and in return,
I offer you these to take to the King.

48:38.291 --> 48:39.291
Dragon teeth?

48:40.083 --> 48:42.750
I've never been one
to look a gift cock in the beak,

48:42.833 --> 48:45.125
though this might not be enough proof
to collect the reward.

48:46.916 --> 48:48.750
Tell the King if he's not satisfied,

48:48.833 --> 48:52.708
he can expect the body of a dragon
dropped upon his royal wedding.

48:52.791 --> 48:54.166
Free of charge.

49:07.208 --> 49:08.125
Aah!

49:45.583 --> 49:48.583
He caught me. He's going to come back,
Dara. We have to hurry.

49:49.833 --> 49:52.333
If we had just stayed in Brokilon, Ciri,
we'd be safe right now!

49:52.416 --> 49:55.291
-How could I have known?
-Because we agreed to it. Hmm?

49:56.833 --> 49:59.208
If I stay with you any longer,
I'll be dead too.

49:59.875 --> 50:01.625
And you say you're so special.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.916
What you really mean is
that you're just like Calanthe!

50:05.041 --> 50:07.708
You bring terror and you bring death
wherever you are!

50:10.291 --> 50:11.875
I'm doing the best that I can.

50:14.375 --> 50:16.750
I'm done apologizing.
I'm done with all of this.

50:16.833 --> 50:18.208
I have to move on.

50:24.541 --> 50:25.958
You're right, Princess.

50:29.166 --> 50:30.166
Find a new family,

50:30.666 --> 50:32.750
because I can't be there for you anymore.

50:55.916 --> 50:57.916
This is my final first.

51:00.125 --> 51:01.125
A child.

51:02.791 --> 51:04.625
This treasure, this legacy

51:05.041 --> 51:06.208
must endure.

51:07.291 --> 51:09.291
There is no other reason to go on.

51:10.791 --> 51:12.291
Thank you for protecting it.

51:13.791 --> 51:15.875
And thank you, Yennefer of Vengerberg.

51:17.125 --> 51:19.708
I can see why Geralt didn't want
to lose you.

51:21.541 --> 51:22.541
What does that mean?

51:31.958 --> 51:33.000
In Rinde.

51:35.458 --> 51:36.625
The djinn.

51:38.958 --> 51:41.083
That's why we can't escape each other.

51:43.250 --> 51:44.833
Why I feel this way inside.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.333
No.

51:46.416 --> 51:48.291
It's not because of anything real...

51:48.875 --> 51:49.916
or true.

51:52.291 --> 51:53.416
You made a wish.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
It's magic.

51:56.750 --> 51:58.791
-It's real, Yen.
-How could we ever know?

52:02.250 --> 52:05.375
Disregard for other's freedom
has become quite your trademark.

52:05.875 --> 52:08.958
-I made that wish to save your life.
-I didn't need your help!

52:09.041 --> 52:10.166
Like fuck you didn't!

52:10.791 --> 52:13.958
And you, you flit about like a tornado,

52:14.708 --> 52:16.666
wreaking havoc, and for what?

52:17.541 --> 52:18.750
So you can have a baby?

52:19.708 --> 52:22.750
A child is no way
to boost your fragile ego, Yen.

52:22.833 --> 52:26.125
I'll take advice from you about children
as soon as you take responsibility

52:26.208 --> 52:28.041
for the one you bound to you
and then abandoned!

52:28.125 --> 52:29.333
That's enough.

52:34.208 --> 52:37.666
I'm going to save you both a lot of hurt
with a little pain now.

52:39.458 --> 52:42.083
The sorceress will never regain her womb.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.375
And though you didn't want to lose her,
Geralt,

52:47.708 --> 52:48.750
you will.

52:53.625 --> 52:54.666
He already has.

53:11.750 --> 53:13.791
You wanted to show me
what I was missing...

53:16.333 --> 53:17.291
there she goes.

53:19.833 --> 53:21.958
What you're missing is still out there.

53:22.875 --> 53:23.958
Your legacy.

53:24.791 --> 53:26.875
Your destiny. I know it.

53:28.208 --> 53:29.416
And you know it.

53:44.416 --> 53:46.416
Phew! What a day!

53:47.166 --> 53:49.541
-I imagine you're probably--
-Damn it, Jaskier!

53:50.375 --> 53:53.083
Why is it whenever I find myself
in a pile of shit these days,

53:53.166 --> 53:55.458
-it's you, shoveling it?
-Well, that's not fair.

53:55.541 --> 53:57.791
The Child Surprise, the djinn,

53:57.875 --> 53:58.875
all of it!

53:59.291 --> 54:01.500
If life could give me one blessing,

54:01.583 --> 54:04.333
it would be to take you off my hands.

54:13.125 --> 54:14.333
Right. Uh...

54:17.833 --> 54:18.708
Right, then.

54:20.875 --> 54:21.750
I'll...

54:22.250 --> 54:24.416
I'll go get the rest of the story
from the others.

54:29.416 --> 54:30.583
See you around, Geralt.

55:00.625 --> 55:02.208
They're combing the area.

55:03.583 --> 55:04.750
They haven't found him,

55:05.541 --> 55:06.500
or the girl.

55:12.666 --> 55:14.833
A simple test of silver would've sufficed.

55:14.916 --> 55:16.041
I had steel at the ready.

55:18.333 --> 55:21.250
We can pull in more soldiers.
Keep searching.

55:22.291 --> 55:23.458
We won't stop.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
We cannot mistake the stars reflecting
in a pond for those in the night sky.

55:30.083 --> 55:31.916
Spare me the lecture, Fringilla.

55:42.791 --> 55:44.666
You rose up against the Usurper.

55:47.416 --> 55:49.791
Helped free our people from their chains.

55:51.875 --> 55:54.333
I witnessed the White Flame call on you...

55:57.208 --> 55:58.208
mold you...

55:59.541 --> 56:01.541
anoint <i>you.</i>

56:04.208 --> 56:05.875
It burns in you, Cahir.

56:08.416 --> 56:09.625
She is the key,

56:10.958 --> 56:11.833
but you...

56:13.291 --> 56:14.625
you are the commissioner.

56:17.375 --> 56:18.375
Do not despair.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.250
We will find her.

56:20.916 --> 56:23.416
And we will spread his supremacy
all through the kingdoms,

56:23.500 --> 56:24.875
whether they deserve it...

56:25.750 --> 56:26.750
or not.
