02:43.242 --> 02:45.610
KURT: <i>Three weeks to the
day since his funeral,</i>

02:45.644 --> 02:47.979
<i>and it's the first time</i>
<i>I've had the courage</i>

02:48.013 --> 02:51.048
<i>to even look at the suit</i>
<i>I wore to it.</i>

02:51.083 --> 02:53.217

<i>for a special memorial.</i>

02:53.252 --> 02:54.619

02:54.653 --> 02:57.154

02:57.189 --> 03:00.324
<i>Being together is hard...</i>
<i>it makes it more real...</i>

03:00.359 --> 03:02.793
<i>but I also need</i>
<i>my friends right now.</i>

03:04.930 --> 03:06.898
<i>People keep asking me,</i>

03:06.932 --> 03:09.333
<i>"How are you feeling?</i>
What <i>are you feeling?"</i>

03:09.368 --> 03:11.402
<i>I have no answers.</i>

03:11.436 --> 03:13.971
<i>Honestly, what can you say</i>
<i>about a 19-year-old who dies?</i>

03:14.006 --> 03:16.507
<i>Everyone wants to talk</i>
<i>about how he died, too,</i>

03:16.541 --> 03:17.942
<i>but who cares?</i>

03:17.976 --> 03:19.510
<i>One moment in his whole life.</i>

03:19.544 --> 03:21.145
<i>I care more about how he lived.</i>

03:21.179 --> 03:23.047
<i>And anyone</i>
<i>who has a problem with that</i>

03:23.081 --> 03:26.183
<i>should remember</i>
<i>that he was my brother.</i>

03:26.218 --> 03:29.520
<i>I only keep that out</i>
<i>when I know she won't come in.</i>

03:29.554 --> 03:32.456
(echoing):
Rachel?

03:32.491 --> 03:34.759
I'm going now.

03:36.161 --> 03:38.129
<i>This isn't real.</i>

03:38.163 --> 03:39.730
<i>I'm not going home for this.</i>

03:39.765 --> 03:41.732
<i>He's going to be there.</i>

03:41.767 --> 03:45.436
<i>I'm going to spend</i>
<i>my entire life missing him.</i>

03:45.470 --> 03:47.571
(school bell ringing)

03:47.606 --> 03:49.273
You know, I've cleared
my entire schedule

03:49.308 --> 03:51.175
to provide my services
to students and faculty,

03:51.209 --> 03:53.644
and not a single person's
come in for grief counseling.

03:53.679 --> 03:54.812
Well, maybe that's because

03:54.846 --> 03:56.113
you're not a certified
grief counselor.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.115
Maybe that's because
you're just the jittery,

03:58.150 --> 03:59.850
mentally-ill bird lady
they turn to

03:59.885 --> 04:02.019
to find out what college
they won't be attending

04:02.054 --> 04:03.754
because they missed
the application deadline.

04:03.789 --> 04:06.490
If students wish to mourn
Finn's passing, they're free

04:06.525 --> 04:08.459
to visit the memorial garden
that I erected.

04:08.493 --> 04:10.394
I planted a tree in

04:10.429 --> 04:12.396
the exact location
where I caught Finn

04:12.431 --> 04:14.732
and Quinn Fabray fondling
each other's breasts.

04:14.766 --> 04:16.334
Come on, Sue. BEISTE:
How can you even

04:16.368 --> 04:18.101
joke at a time like this?

04:18.136 --> 04:19.803
SUE: Oh, take it easy,
Post-Op Michael Chiklis.

04:19.838 --> 04:21.305
I'm grieving.

04:21.339 --> 04:24.075
And I grieve by insulting those
who mean the most to me.

04:24.109 --> 04:26.210
It's just a coincidence
that it's also what I do

04:26.244 --> 04:27.445
when I'm not grieving.

04:27.479 --> 04:30.548
It just feels so surreal.

04:30.582 --> 04:32.149
They don't make 'em like Finn.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.151
He was our quarterback.

04:34.186 --> 04:37.321
We honor Finn Hudson by taking
care of the people he loved,

04:37.356 --> 04:39.590
and the way we do that

04:39.624 --> 04:41.525
is by helping them to move on.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.194
How?

04:43.228 --> 04:46.764
By not making a self-serving
spectacle of our own sadness.

04:46.798 --> 04:48.499
And I think we can all agree,

04:48.533 --> 04:49.894
that's what Finn
would have wanted.

04:52.404 --> 04:54.572
I'm really glad so many of you

04:54.606 --> 04:56.273
could make it back for this.

04:56.308 --> 04:57.708
MIKE: We wouldn't miss it
for anything, Mr. Shue.

04:57.743 --> 04:59.377
The funeral

04:59.411 --> 05:02.279
was for everyone, but I wanted
to do something just for us.

05:02.314 --> 05:03.781
To memorialize him

05:03.815 --> 05:06.584
the only way we know how...

05:06.618 --> 05:07.918
by singing.

05:07.953 --> 05:09.787
(sighs) All week long.

05:09.821 --> 05:11.856
Anyone who wants to
can come up and sing.

05:11.890 --> 05:14.225
Maybe a song he sung,

05:14.259 --> 05:15.493
maybe something that
reminds you of him...

05:15.527 --> 05:17.007
Singing isn't going
to bring him back.

05:17.029 --> 05:18.662
No, it's not.

05:19.831 --> 05:20.798
Nothing is.

05:20.832 --> 05:23.901
Not ever.

05:23.935 --> 05:26.937
But... for two minutes or so,

05:26.972 --> 05:29.974
we can all maybe remember
the best parts of him.

05:30.008 --> 05:32.376
So, think of
what you want to sing,

05:32.411 --> 05:34.345
if you want to sing,
and we'll start tomorrow.

05:34.379 --> 05:38.049
Oh, I-I can't wait
until tomorrow, Mr. Shue.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.384
I've been bawling
for three weeks.

05:40.419 --> 05:43.054
If I don't get this all out now,

05:43.088 --> 05:45.423
I don't think
I'll ever stop crying.

05:45.457 --> 05:47.391
Sure, Mercedes. Start us off.
Um...

05:47.426 --> 05:50.728
I, uh, remember Finn telling me

05:50.762 --> 05:54.198
that he sang this song
to his baby's sonogram.

05:54.232 --> 05:57.601
Well, he thought
it was his baby.

05:57.636 --> 06:02.006
He was the first cool kid
to be nice to any of us,

06:02.040 --> 06:05.943
and he was...
our leader in here.

06:07.312 --> 06:09.280
We love you, Finn.

09:03.955 --> 09:05.923
Sweet, gentle Porcelain,

09:05.957 --> 09:08.993
I know you were instrumental
in raising the funds

09:09.027 --> 09:11.695
for the tree in the memorial
garden in Finn's honor.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.697
All I did was drive
to Home Depot

09:13.732 --> 09:15.733
and buy a tree
for $20, but, yes.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.768
Well, it looks like
we're gonna have to dip

09:17.802 --> 09:19.837
into your West Village Halloween
Parade Assless Chap Fund

09:19.871 --> 09:21.038
once again.

09:21.072 --> 09:22.406
Tree is gone.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.209
Someone's vandalized
the memorial.

09:25.243 --> 09:26.377
(chain clanking)

09:28.913 --> 09:30.381
(engine revving)

09:30.415 --> 09:32.483
I don't understand! Why would
someone do something like that?

09:32.517 --> 09:33.751
Who knows?

09:33.785 --> 09:36.287
Grief can bring out
the irrational in all of us.

09:36.321 --> 09:39.056
<i>Sometimes it makes</i>
<i>people do very strange things.</i>

09:39.090 --> 09:41.058
<i>Sometimes when people die,</i>

09:41.092 --> 09:43.661
<i>we want to hold on</i>
<i>to what's left of them</i>

09:43.695 --> 09:46.664
<i>to get us through</i>
<i>the hard times.</i>

09:46.698 --> 09:50.401
I'll take that $20
for a new tree, please.

09:50.435 --> 09:51.315
I prefer exact change.

09:52.270 --> 09:52.970
Thanks.

09:53.004 --> 09:55.239
(school bell ringing)

09:55.273 --> 10:00.044
KURT: I marked these boxes so it'd
be easier to separate things.

10:00.078 --> 10:01.979
Thanks, honey.

10:02.013 --> 10:04.415
You don't have to do this now.
It can wait.

10:04.449 --> 10:06.750
There's no timetable.
CAROLE: No.

10:06.785 --> 10:08.986
We should do it now, or...

10:09.020 --> 10:11.388
I'm afraid I'll never do it.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.591
(sighs heavily)

10:17.929 --> 10:20.097
KURT:
Look.

10:20.131 --> 10:23.534
It's the ball from the
first game we ever scored at.

10:24.569 --> 10:26.603
You should keep this, Dad.

10:26.638 --> 10:30.574
That was the weirdest
football game I ever been to.

10:30.608 --> 10:32.576
Look, it's the faggy lamp

10:32.610 --> 10:34.578
from my Marlene Dietrich

10:34.612 --> 10:36.780
basement redecoration.

10:36.815 --> 10:39.616
I think he kept it in here
to prove a point to Burt.

10:39.651 --> 10:41.085
BURT:
You know, if it's, uh,

10:41.119 --> 10:43.620
okay with everyone, I think
I'd like to keep that lamp.

10:43.655 --> 10:46.123
No. It's not okay with me.
That thing is awful.

10:46.157 --> 10:48.025
BURT:
I need a lamp

10:48.059 --> 10:50.728
in my office at the shop.

10:51.996 --> 10:54.832
I tore into him about this lamp.

10:54.866 --> 10:56.433
You know, I was right,
in principle,

10:56.468 --> 10:58.435
but, you know, come on.
The kid didn't have

10:58.470 --> 11:01.739
a prejudiced bone in his body.

11:01.773 --> 11:05.309
I knew what he meant when
he was calling it "faggy."

11:05.343 --> 11:07.311
I wasn't teaching him

11:07.345 --> 11:09.713
a lesson in tolerance,
I was teaching myself one,

11:09.748 --> 11:12.516
and he was just unlucky enough
to be there for it.

11:19.457 --> 11:21.759
CAROLE: Finn knew how you
felt about him, honey.

11:21.793 --> 11:23.694
He kind of liked it
when you yelled at him.

11:23.728 --> 11:26.063
Should've hugged him more,
you know?

11:27.565 --> 11:29.833
No, it was always...

11:29.868 --> 11:34.605
you know, we'd fist-bump
or we'd high-five, but...

11:34.639 --> 11:37.141
I should've given him more hugs.

11:37.175 --> 11:39.510
You know, the last
time I saw him,

11:39.544 --> 11:44.114
he was so bummed out about
some test at school, and...

11:44.149 --> 11:46.116
I just, you know...

11:46.151 --> 11:48.986
told him
to get back at it, you know?

11:49.020 --> 11:51.021
He was worth it.

11:52.891 --> 11:56.059
(voice breaking): It was
the perfect time for a hug.

11:57.595 --> 12:00.264
But for whatever reason,
I just...

12:00.298 --> 12:03.534
I gave him a pat on the back...

12:03.568 --> 12:05.903
and that's that.

12:06.938 --> 12:08.939
Now he's gone.

12:14.045 --> 12:15.846
KURT:
Oh, d-don't.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.481
I need that.

12:17.515 --> 12:18.715
I want it.

12:21.986 --> 12:25.722
Seeing him come into the
hallway wearing this...

12:25.757 --> 12:29.593
it was like Superman
had arrived.

I always thought
that when I, uh...

12:50.949 --> 12:53.484
(sniffles)

12:53.518 --> 12:57.921
How do parents go on
when they lose a child?

12:57.956 --> 13:00.190
You know, when I would see
that stuff on the news,

13:00.225 --> 13:02.593
I'd shut it off, 'cause it was
just too horrible to think,

13:02.627 --> 13:03.994
but I would always think:

13:04.028 --> 13:06.530
how do they wake up every day?

13:06.564 --> 13:09.700
I mean, h-h... (gasping)

13:09.734 --> 13:12.469
how do they breathe, honey?

13:12.504 --> 13:15.005
(muffled sob)

13:15.039 --> 13:17.641
But you do wake up.

13:17.675 --> 13:20.978
And for just a second,

13:21.012 --> 13:23.013
you forget.

13:24.549 --> 13:26.383
And then...

13:26.417 --> 13:29.586
oh, you remember.

13:29.621 --> 13:32.222
And it's like getting
that call again...

13:32.257 --> 13:35.626
and again, every time.

13:35.660 --> 13:40.063
You don't get to
stop waking up.

13:40.098 --> 13:41.965
You have to keep on
being a parent,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.468
even though you don't get
to have a child anymore.

13:44.502 --> 13:45.936

the Glee Club, being a loser,

14:17.735 --> 14:20.637
an outcast and a misfit,
it... it all became okay.

14:20.672 --> 14:22.272

Shouldn't you be with

17:04.808 --> 17:06.776
I-I don't mean to pry...
it's just,

17:06.810 --> 17:08.611
I had Tina mourning in song

17:08.645 --> 17:11.280
with the Glee Club
until 10:45 at the earliest.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.249

New Santana Lopez

17:28.531 --> 17:31.667
is right, Old Santana Lopez.

17:31.702 --> 17:35.337
Under the tyrannical
jackboot of Sylvester regime,

17:35.372 --> 17:36.672
I am powerless,

one of us farted,

17:44.481 --> 17:47.183
and I'm about 60% sure
it wasn't me.

17:47.217 --> 17:48.884
You have no right
to take down that memorial.

17:48.919 --> 17:51.087
Well, as a matter of fact,
I do, Sandbags. I allowed

17:51.121 --> 17:53.656
that memorial to remain in the
hallway for over a week. Oh, please.

17:53.690 --> 17:54.990
You wanted that memorial gone

a coldhearted bitch.

17:58.228 --> 18:01.630
A miserable,
self-centered bitch,

18:01.665 --> 18:03.933
who has spent
every waking minute

18:03.967 --> 18:06.969
of the past three years trying
to make our lives miserable.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.337
I'm officially over it.

18:08.371 --> 18:10.272
I don't care for your attitude.
Well,

18:10.307 --> 18:12.908

ass what you care for.

anymore, Sue,

18:15.846 --> 18:17.713

I can finally tell you

18:17.748 --> 18:19.782
exactly what I think of you.

18:19.816 --> 18:21.450
I have hated you

18:21.485 --> 18:23.486
ever since the day I met you.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.621
You are a horrible person

18:25.655 --> 18:28.357
who never had a nice word
to say about Finn Hudson,

18:28.391 --> 18:30.493
so don't you dare think
for a second

18:30.527 --> 18:31.994
that he didn't hate you, too!

18:32.028 --> 18:35.531
If I were you, I would choose my
next few words very carefully.

18:35.565 --> 18:37.833
What are you gonna do?
You gonna expel me?

18:37.868 --> 18:38.968

out of my office!

and I swear to God,
I will shove my foot so far...

you took the time
to come talk to me today.

18:59.956 --> 19:01.857
I know a lot of young people

19:01.892 --> 19:03.859
have trouble expressing
feelings of sadness.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.862
I just don't know how
much longer I can do this.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.197
Do what?

19:08.231 --> 19:11.200
I just don't know how much
longer I can wear black.

19:11.234 --> 19:14.870
I feel like this look is
so Tina two years ago.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.373
And I spent so much time
transitioning away from goth,

19:17.407 --> 19:20.142
and look at me... it's, like,
I'm back in that look.

19:21.178 --> 19:22.878
Okay, yeah.
I'm just gonna see

19:22.913 --> 19:25.514
what I... have
in my drawer here.

19:25.549 --> 19:27.683
Okay. All right.

19:27.717 --> 19:29.752
So, why don't you

19:29.786 --> 19:31.821
have a look at these...

19:31.855 --> 19:34.857
on your way out.

19:34.891 --> 19:37.326
Okay?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.662

I'm happy some people are
finally coming to you for help.

19:47.304 --> 19:50.539
Mm-hmm. But I don't think
I need grief counseling.

19:50.574 --> 19:51.707
Have a seat.

Okay? I stood right next
to you at the funeral.

20:03.086 --> 20:05.020
And I couldn't help
but notice something.

20:05.055 --> 20:06.288
What?

20:06.323 --> 20:08.724
You haven't cried.

20:08.758 --> 20:10.726
What are you saying, that...

20:10.760 --> 20:12.561
that-that I don't feel anything?
No, that's

20:12.596 --> 20:13.996
not what... Of course I
feel something, Emma.

20:14.030 --> 20:16.498
I-I feel...

20:16.533 --> 20:20.436
I feel more than I know
how to express. I...

20:20.470 --> 20:22.504
I'm heartbroken.

20:22.539 --> 20:24.139
To be honest,
I don't even know how

20:24.174 --> 20:26.208
we're all supposed to move
forward, but in the meantime,

20:26.243 --> 20:27.676
I have to make sure
that the people

20:27.711 --> 20:28.844
around me are taken care of.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.412
Okay. Okay.

20:30.447 --> 20:32.167
Look, I-I... this... Listen to me.
Listen...

20:32.182 --> 20:33.282
Listen to me; listen.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.750
I love you, okay?

20:34.784 --> 20:37.219
I know. Whatever you feel and
however you want to show it,

20:37.254 --> 20:39.154
that's okay.

20:39.189 --> 20:40.522
I just...

20:40.557 --> 20:42.524
I think there's
gonna come a time

20:42.559 --> 20:45.461
when you need to... let it
all out, and I want you to know

20:45.495 --> 20:47.763
that I plan on being here
for you when you do.

20:49.132 --> 20:51.333

21:04.086 --> 21:05.453
You're beautiful.

21:05.488 --> 21:07.522
You puke in my locker room,
you're cleaning it up.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.624
Come on...
what's the big deal?

21:09.659 --> 21:11.960
(frustrated sigh)

21:11.994 --> 21:16.731
I get needing something to get
through the first few days,

21:16.766 --> 21:19.801
but it's been a month.

21:19.835 --> 21:22.837
You don't have to be scared
to have feelings.

21:22.872 --> 21:24.072
That's crap!

21:24.106 --> 21:25.440
Of course I do!

21:30.580 --> 21:32.981
Understands what?
Tell me!

21:34.951 --> 21:38.420
That if I start crying,
I don't think I'll ever stop!

21:49.865 --> 21:51.232
Yeah.

21:51.267 --> 21:53.268
That was his specialty.

21:54.670 --> 21:56.504
Sit down.

22:09.585 --> 22:11.586
(crying):
I can't take it...

22:16.692 --> 22:19.294
What chance do I have
of not being an idiot

22:19.328 --> 22:21.129
and hurting people

22:21.163 --> 22:24.299
without him around
to remind me who I really am?

22:24.333 --> 22:28.003
You just got to do that
for yourself now...

22:28.037 --> 22:30.005
and see yourself
how he saw you.

22:30.039 --> 22:32.040
It's not good enough for me!

22:32.074 --> 22:34.042
It's not like when he was alive.

22:34.076 --> 22:35.710
(crying):
You got to make it good enough,

22:35.745 --> 22:37.579
because it's all we got left.

22:37.613 --> 22:39.414
And I'm telling
you this straight,

22:39.448 --> 22:41.149
'cause that's how
you and I talk.

22:43.185 --> 22:45.020
(sniffles)

22:45.054 --> 22:46.955
He's dead...

22:46.989 --> 22:50.258
and all we've got left is
his voice in our head.

22:50.292 --> 22:52.293
(sobbing quietly)

22:53.396 --> 22:55.797
I'm sorry, but it's time you...

22:55.831 --> 22:58.099
you got to be your
own quarterback.

(sighs deeply)

23:06.375 --> 23:08.877
(sighs)

23:08.911 --> 23:11.680
Do you think we could...
retire his number?

23:11.714 --> 23:13.982
Kurt has his letterman jacket.

23:14.016 --> 23:16.151
Maybe... maybe we could
frame it or something,

23:16.185 --> 23:17.886
and put it up in here.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.487
Mm.

23:19.522 --> 23:21.322
Other kids should
know who he was.

23:21.357 --> 23:22.891
Years from now.

23:22.925 --> 23:24.392
Yeah.

23:24.427 --> 23:27.328
I can get that done.

23:28.798 --> 23:31.466
But you got to promise
to put the tree back.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.335
I didn't take the tree.

23:35.337 --> 23:36.471
Fine, I took the tree.

23:36.505 --> 23:38.106
Mm-hmm.
(sniffles)

23:38.140 --> 23:39.674
It was a garbage tree, though.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.776
It wasn't big enough.

(school bell ringing)

23:46.182 --> 23:50.585
Okay, I know that Finn had
his doubts about God,

23:50.619 --> 23:52.087
but I am convinced

23:52.121 --> 23:54.155
that Squishyteets is up
in Heaven right now,

best friend Fat Elvis,

26:06.956 --> 26:09.524

for once in my life

26:09.558 --> 26:11.626
and say all these
nice things about Finn,

26:11.660 --> 26:13.928
and then, at the last minute,
I chickened out.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.731
I even wrote them all down.

26:19.168 --> 26:21.135
Would you read it to me?

it's that shame
is a wasted emotion.

26:32.815 --> 26:36.050
I'm sure Finn had secrets,
too, but who cares now?

26:36.085 --> 26:39.187
Do you really think,
one day, on your deathbed,

26:39.221 --> 26:42.423
you're gonna think, "Oh, good,

that you took it.

I didn't.
But if you did,

that all of us want some piece

could be a lesson.

you could start being nicer...

31:44.017 --> 31:45.684
Oh, cut the crap, will you?
I don't care about that.

there's no happy ending.

32:01.668 --> 32:03.836

an excellent teacher.

and he loved all of you guys.

33:24.839 --> 33:27.641
I know he did.

33:29.710 --> 33:33.547
I like to sing in
the car and, um...

33:33.581 --> 33:37.551
(crying): and before Finn,
I used to sing alone...

33:38.920 --> 33:41.021

36:35.162 --> 36:37.664
(Will sighs)

36:41.335 --> 36:44.971
(whistles softly)
That's a pretty hefty reward.

36:45.005 --> 36:47.240
It's not a reward;
it's bait.

36:47.274 --> 36:51.378
I'm gonna kick the crap out of
whoever brings that jacket back.

36:51.412 --> 36:53.646
And I want it back
before I go home.

36:53.681 --> 36:54.881
Home... here home?

36:54.915 --> 36:56.116
New York.

36:57.451 --> 36:59.185
That's my home now.

36:59.220 --> 37:01.388
I'm not coming back here
for a while.

37:01.422 --> 37:02.922
More than a while.

37:02.957 --> 37:04.991
Maybe never.

37:05.025 --> 37:07.861
You know, I used
to love coming here,

37:07.895 --> 37:09.896
but now this just reminds me

37:09.930 --> 37:12.732
of everything that I've lost.

37:12.767 --> 37:15.168
I understand.

37:15.202 --> 37:17.170
You should go.

37:17.204 --> 37:18.271
Well, geez, Mr. Shue,

37:18.305 --> 37:20.340
you don't have to rush me
out of the door.

37:20.374 --> 37:22.642
(laughs) I'm a teacher.

37:22.676 --> 37:24.110
It's supposed to make me happy

37:24.145 --> 37:26.546
to see my kids grow up
and leave the nest.

37:27.581 --> 37:29.382
Does it?

37:29.417 --> 37:31.751
Well, I can say for a fact that

37:31.786 --> 37:34.387
it certainly beats
the alternative.

37:34.422 --> 37:37.190
♪

37:37.224 --> 37:38.792
(softly):
Hey.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.431
(sighs)

37:51.472 --> 37:52.539
What...?

37:52.573 --> 37:54.441
It's root beer.
Oh.

37:54.475 --> 37:55.909
(chuckles)

38:00.848 --> 38:01.981
Mmm.
Mmm.

38:02.016 --> 38:03.917
So, what do you think?

38:03.951 --> 38:06.052
50 years from now,
when this tree 30 feet tall

38:06.086 --> 38:08.021
and the kids come
to make out under it,

38:08.055 --> 38:09.889
will they know
who it was planted for?

38:09.924 --> 38:11.458
Probably not.

38:11.492 --> 38:14.260
You know what's tripping me out

38:14.295 --> 38:15.595
is this line

38:15.629 --> 38:17.597
between the two years.

38:17.631 --> 38:18.832
It's his whole life.

38:18.866 --> 38:21.234
Everything that happened
is in that line.

38:21.268 --> 38:23.236
What are you gonna do
with your line now, Puckerman?

38:23.270 --> 38:25.305
I'm gonna make a man of myself.

38:25.339 --> 38:27.474
(sighs)

38:27.508 --> 38:29.709
Figured if I don't have Finn,
I need an army to help me.

38:29.710 --> 38:31.211
Are you serious? The army?

38:31.245 --> 38:32.479
Air Force, actually.

38:32.513 --> 38:34.848
Thought maybe I could be
a top gun.

38:34.882 --> 38:37.383
I think they were actually
Naval aviators in that movie.

38:39.553 --> 38:41.354
You know, if Finn was around,

38:41.388 --> 38:43.723
I'd just keep letting him
point me in the right direction.

38:45.359 --> 38:46.960
Now...

38:46.994 --> 38:49.262
it's up to me
to figure it all out.

38:49.296 --> 38:51.564
I'm proud of you.

38:51.599 --> 38:53.233
You know?

38:53.267 --> 38:55.001
Just don't get shot, okay?

38:55.035 --> 38:56.936
Thanks, Coach.

38:56.971 --> 38:59.639
(grunts affectionately)

38:59.673 --> 39:01.674
(sighs)

39:03.611 --> 39:05.011
Keep watering that tree.

39:05.045 --> 39:06.779
You got it.

39:06.814 --> 39:08.781
Have a good line.

39:08.816 --> 39:10.884
(engine starts)

39:23.378 --> 39:25.412
Hey, Mr. Shue.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.314
Hey, Rachel.

39:27.349 --> 39:29.817
I get flashbacks when you walk
in here and say that.

39:29.851 --> 39:31.519
Good ones.

39:31.553 --> 39:33.187
How are you doing?

39:33.221 --> 39:35.389
Everyone keeps asking me that.

39:35.423 --> 39:37.725
Well, from what I hear,
you've been a rock for everyone,

39:37.759 --> 39:39.827
so I know that that means

39:39.861 --> 39:41.896
that sometimes you don't get
to grieve yourself.

39:41.930 --> 39:43.731
I'm okay.

39:43.765 --> 39:46.233
I mean, I'm...

39:46.268 --> 39:47.434
I'm really not okay,

39:47.469 --> 39:49.503
but, uh, yeah,

39:49.538 --> 39:51.105
I'm-I'm okay.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.375
More importantly, how are you?

39:58.313 --> 40:01.015
I have no idea.

40:01.049 --> 40:03.551
(sighs)

40:03.585 --> 40:05.786
I talk to him a lot.

40:07.756 --> 40:09.490
I can still see his face

40:09.524 --> 40:12.793
and can hear his voice
so clearly.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.796
Do you think
that I'll ever forget it?

40:17.999 --> 40:20.601
'Cause I'm afraid
that one day, I will.

40:20.635 --> 40:22.536
What do you talk to him about?

40:22.571 --> 40:24.204
Anything.

40:24.239 --> 40:26.273
I mean, when we were dating,
it was, you know,

40:26.308 --> 40:27.741
pretty much me talking
all the time

40:27.776 --> 40:29.443
and him just pretending
to listen,

40:29.477 --> 40:30.678
so it's not really
that different.

40:30.712 --> 40:31.745
(chuckles)

40:31.780 --> 40:34.114
I had it all planned out.

40:34.149 --> 40:36.984
(crying)

40:37.018 --> 40:40.554
I was gonna make it big
on Broadway

40:40.589 --> 40:44.191
and maybe do
a Woody Allen movie.

40:44.225 --> 40:46.794
And then when we were ready,

40:46.828 --> 40:49.930
I would just...

40:49.965 --> 40:52.666
come back,
and he'd be teaching here,

40:52.701 --> 40:54.768
and I'd walk
through those doors,

40:54.803 --> 40:56.470
and I would just say,
"I'm home."

40:58.540 --> 41:00.207
And then we would live

41:00.241 --> 41:02.409
happily ever after.

41:02.444 --> 41:05.613
It's a good plan.

41:05.647 --> 41:07.615
Did you tell him?

41:07.649 --> 41:08.949
I didn't have to.

41:08.984 --> 41:10.884
He knew.

41:10.919 --> 41:13.020
And...

41:13.054 --> 41:14.989
now what?

41:15.023 --> 41:16.991
I don't know.

41:17.025 --> 41:18.258
Something different.

41:18.293 --> 41:19.960
Maybe something better.

41:19.995 --> 41:22.863
I just... I don't think
that that's possible.

41:24.299 --> 41:26.300
He was my person.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.540
But thank you so much
for doing this.

41:33.575 --> 41:36.777
I felt like I didn't know

41:36.811 --> 41:38.545
if I would be able
to sing again,

41:38.580 --> 41:42.016
but now I know that I can.

41:43.385 --> 41:46.020
And I know that there have been
a lot of memorials for him,

41:46.054 --> 41:48.422
but I had this made,

41:48.456 --> 41:50.958
and I was hoping
that we could hang it in here.

41:55.130 --> 41:57.197
(sighs)

41:59.000 --> 42:00.100
Did he really say that?

42:00.135 --> 42:01.769
(both chuckling)

42:01.803 --> 42:03.404
He was smart, just, you know,

42:03.438 --> 42:05.639
in an... in an untraditional
kind of way.

42:05.674 --> 42:06.874
(chuckles)

42:08.343 --> 42:11.078
Come on, let's... let's
hang it right over there.
