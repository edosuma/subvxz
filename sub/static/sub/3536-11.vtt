WEBVTT

00:00.657 --> 00:02.789
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:02.914 --> 00:05.315
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.476 --> 00:07.551
Claire first.
We know where she is?

00:07.660 --> 00:08.809
She's in protective custody.

00:08.930 --> 00:09.817
You want your wife back,

00:09.918 --> 00:11.524
they've got the skills
and the know-how.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.441
We got another problem.
Joe made an attempt

00:13.538 --> 00:14.959
to trace Claire
Matthews' location.

00:15.052 --> 00:16.073
We got to move her right now.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.482
Is there a problem out there?

00:17.613 --> 00:18.733
My men in the lobby
saw a couple guys

00:18.838 --> 00:20.096
who look suspicious.

00:20.701 --> 00:21.690
Take Claire and go
out the back.

00:23.714 --> 00:25.503
I'm sorry I brought
my problems into your home.

00:25.616 --> 00:26.713
You did the right thing
coming here.

00:26.815 --> 00:27.695
This is a safe place.

00:27.808 --> 00:28.733
So you guys are pretty close

00:28.830 --> 00:30.592
or as close as anyone
can get to the man.

00:30.701 --> 00:32.703
Last girl Molly,
she wanted to be serious.

00:32.831 --> 00:33.904
You can't just blame me.

00:34.023 --> 00:35.269
I was doing what
Roderick told me

00:35.362 --> 00:36.215
to do for Joey.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.148
You didn't have to leave us.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.136
What is it?

00:39.229 --> 00:40.162
They must have tagged you.

00:40.255 --> 00:41.807
Does that mean they
know we're here?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.487
You don't want
to do that, Claire.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.818
Take me to my son.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.493
Claire!

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:31.464 --> 01:32.267
Hello.

01:32.376 --> 01:33.812
Oh.
Good morning, Ryan.

01:34.389 --> 01:38.828
Oh. Oh. I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

01:38.941 --> 01:41.331
Not sleeping in, are you?

01:43.023 --> 01:44.560
Oh, dear. You've
been drinking.

01:44.644 --> 01:47.350
I knew you would take
losing Claire badly,

01:47.470 --> 01:49.284
but I didn't think
it would send you

01:49.367 --> 01:51.949
spiraling back into the
bottle quite so quickly.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.084
What do you want?

01:53.188 --> 01:56.342
Um, nothing... much.

01:56.454 --> 01:59.206
Just wanted to
check in on my hero,

01:59.319 --> 02:02.563
say good morning,
gloat a little.

02:02.667 --> 02:04.222
Go to hell.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.889
You know, I never
expected you to

02:25.017 --> 02:26.506
give up drinking entirely.

02:26.622 --> 02:28.188
Sobriety doesn't
actually suit you,

02:28.290 --> 02:29.978
but you must learn to become

02:30.081 --> 02:34.043
a functioning alcoholic
at the very least.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.809
I can assure you, I
will not be emphasizing

02:35.922 --> 02:38.542
your drinking in our book.

02:38.651 --> 02:41.227
It's a tired cliché,
however true.

02:41.323 --> 02:42.683
Is there a point to this call?

02:42.806 --> 02:44.938
Well, clearly,
you need a pep talk.

02:45.087 --> 02:48.024
You got to hold it
together, Ryan.

02:48.129 --> 02:51.373
You can't fall apart
on me, not just yet.

02:51.478 --> 02:52.854
Why not?

02:53.270 --> 02:54.478
What's next, Joe?

02:54.568 --> 02:56.145
Well, for you, I would suggest

02:56.255 --> 02:58.354
black coffee and a cold shower.

02:58.568 --> 03:03.404
For me, I am going to spend
time enjoying my family.

03:03.644 --> 03:07.460
I've worked very hard to
be reunited with them.

03:07.628 --> 03:09.548
It's a fresh start
for Claire and I,

03:09.670 --> 03:11.898
and I am gonna do it right.

03:11.982 --> 03:14.121
Now granted, I can't expect her

03:14.246 --> 03:17.632
to exactly hurl herself
back into my arms.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.996
No. It will--
it will take time

03:19.087 --> 03:20.447
to win her love again,

03:20.926 --> 03:25.035
but it is a very
exciting prospect, huh?

03:25.992 --> 03:28.627
Tell me, Ryan, do you believe

03:28.734 --> 03:31.608
that love conquers all?

03:31.714 --> 03:33.830
Now there's a tired cliché.

03:34.502 --> 03:37.821
Hmm. Heh.
Eh, fair enough.

03:37.982 --> 03:39.756
Well, I'm off now.

03:40.397 --> 03:42.177
Big day ahead.

03:42.261 --> 03:43.941
Now you hang in there, Ryan,

03:44.218 --> 03:46.776
and have a nice day.

04:09.055 --> 04:11.765
Hello, Claire.
I'm Jacob.

04:11.868 --> 04:13.759
I know exactly who you are.
Where's my son?

04:14.273 --> 04:16.702
Joe's asked me to show you to
your room so you can freshen up.

04:16.791 --> 04:18.303
No! I want to
see my son!

04:19.339 --> 04:21.488
Please follow me.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.185
It's okay, hon.
Go ahead.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.850
We have a room
all set up for you.

04:51.757 --> 04:53.776
If you need anything,
just let me know.

04:53.874 --> 04:54.914
My son.

04:55.012 --> 04:56.117
I'll let Joe know
that you're here.

04:56.217 --> 04:58.038
Please! Please
take me to him.

04:58.148 --> 04:59.383
I just need to know he's okay.

04:59.492 --> 05:02.197
He's okay, Claire.
I look after him.

05:02.284 --> 05:03.729
Joey's a good kid.

05:03.827 --> 05:05.974
I'll be back in a bit
to check on you.

05:17.769 --> 05:19.764
Our sources tell us
that Miss Matthews

05:19.896 --> 05:21.127
may now be missing...

05:22.300 --> 05:23.829
Possibly taken by Carroll
and his cult.

05:23.952 --> 05:27.317
Carroll's son Joey Matthews
also remains missing.

05:27.457 --> 05:28.369
The FBI--

05:39.177 --> 05:40.380
Am I interrupting?

05:40.477 --> 05:41.548
What are you doing here?

05:41.657 --> 05:43.880
I was concerned.
How's your friend?

05:43.969 --> 05:46.441
He's okay. It's gonna
take some time,

05:46.544 --> 05:47.964
but he's gonna be okay.

05:48.046 --> 05:50.731
You can't just disappear, Ryan.

05:55.661 --> 05:57.409
Please put on some pants.

05:58.644 --> 06:00.760
All your goodies
are in this box,

06:00.853 --> 06:02.043
the journals, summaries,

06:02.200 --> 06:03.555
everything labeled and dated

06:03.680 --> 06:05.653
for perusal at your leisure.

06:05.736 --> 06:07.281
So, Molly,
tell me about New York.

06:07.380 --> 06:08.788
When was the last time
you saw Ryan?

06:08.882 --> 06:11.122
Oh. He dumped me
forever ago.

06:11.232 --> 06:14.085
Yes. He does have a tendency
to push people away.

06:14.184 --> 06:16.931
Well, he's hung up
on you-know-who...

06:17.020 --> 06:17.915
Hmm.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.699
But I still live next door,

06:19.802 --> 06:23.678
and we do the friend and
occasional sex thing,

06:23.800 --> 06:25.112
which is good.

06:25.217 --> 06:26.824
Hmm. And how's work?

06:26.915 --> 06:28.054
Great.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.794
Except for the
occasional mishap.

06:32.047 --> 06:34.119
I have to drive back today.

06:34.365 --> 06:36.637
- I have to work in the morning.
- Yeah.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.703
Roderick speaks
very highly of you.

06:40.809 --> 06:43.401
Because I aced all
of your little tests.

06:43.509 --> 06:44.860
Tell me about yourself.

06:44.963 --> 06:47.287
I'm single,
I live in Pittsburgh,

06:47.405 --> 06:49.296
been an RN for 12 years,

06:49.487 --> 06:52.368
and I've killed
more people than you.

06:52.477 --> 06:53.849
Patients in the hospital.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.497
I'm what the National Center of
the Analysis for Violent Crime

06:56.609 --> 06:59.600
classifies as a mission killer.

06:59.723 --> 07:00.927
Oh. An angel
of death.

07:01.057 --> 07:01.983
Mmm.

07:02.077 --> 07:04.719
Tell me, how do you
decide who lives or dies?

07:04.827 --> 07:08.795
I base it on suffering,
prognosis, will to live,

07:09.061 --> 07:10.812
whether they're
a pain in the ass or not.

07:10.918 --> 07:12.903
I work in the terminal ward.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.944
It is so easy.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.972
Has Roderick told you what
I'd like you to do for me?

07:19.062 --> 07:21.575
He said you wanted me
to follow Ryan Hardy.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.960
And?

07:23.474 --> 07:26.479
I've always wanted
to live in New York.

07:27.644 --> 07:30.480
All the videos are
on this drive.

07:30.574 --> 07:31.362
Ahh.

07:31.461 --> 07:33.365
And they're all indexed
in the journals.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.162
You... you are
a godsend.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.608
It's nothing.

07:40.429 --> 07:43.188
It really is beautiful
what you're doing here

07:43.447 --> 07:45.079
for all of us.

07:52.669 --> 07:54.548
Shall be lifted--

07:56.025 --> 07:58.459
Hello, friend.
You've been allowed entry.

07:58.558 --> 07:59.611
We found an encryption code

07:59.691 --> 08:01.139
that accesses this web site.

08:01.235 --> 08:02.657
This is how they recruit?

08:03.071 --> 08:05.306
My take, they start
an online dialogue.

08:05.409 --> 08:06.809
That's followed
by a real meeting.

08:06.951 --> 08:08.685
Then there's a test
of dedication.

08:08.898 --> 08:10.411
The DC Cyberteam places

08:10.536 --> 08:12.144
the server's location
in Lower Manhattan.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.236
They have to go block by
block with the IP address.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.282
When will they know?

08:15.415 --> 08:16.960
Soon.
In a few hours.

08:17.412 --> 08:18.944
You an alcoholic

08:19.042 --> 08:20.776
or just a problem drinker?

08:21.002 --> 08:21.945
Yes.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.569
That can't be good
for your heart.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.168
It's not.

08:25.795 --> 08:28.317
Look. I'm not good
at bonding.

08:28.431 --> 08:29.931
Healthy relationships
are not my thing.

08:30.011 --> 08:31.686
- I got trust issues--
- Your point?

08:32.068 --> 08:34.806
My point?
I don't have a point.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.017
I'm trying here.

08:37.222 --> 08:38.375
I mean, I look
around this place,

08:38.488 --> 08:40.493
and I don't know
the person who lives here.

08:40.599 --> 08:41.635
It's certainly not the guy
I've been working with

08:41.732 --> 08:43.318
for the last couple of weeks,

08:43.417 --> 08:45.713
and I know you don't want
any of Joe Carroll

08:45.826 --> 08:46.655
or this case,

08:46.760 --> 08:49.816
but I think you may need it,

08:50.622 --> 08:52.053
and I kind of need you.

08:53.574 --> 08:56.195
That's as sappy as I get.
I'm done.

08:56.793 --> 08:58.083
Joe called me.

08:58.293 --> 08:59.741
When? What did he say?

08:59.833 --> 09:01.841
This morning.
Wanted to cheer me up,

09:01.842 --> 09:04.404
wanted to *.

09:04.658 --> 09:06.256
Well, you got to
engage him, Ryan.

09:06.361 --> 09:08.164
You're our connection
to Carroll.

09:09.281 --> 09:10.632
Look. Will you just
get in the shower?

09:10.740 --> 09:12.087
- We got to go downtown...
- No.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.400
And don't argue.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.839
I owe you both a great debt,

09:19.009 --> 09:22.109
and I am truly story
about Brock.

09:22.699 --> 09:25.145
Yeah. It really sucks.

09:26.209 --> 09:29.384
So now that you have
your family back,

09:29.494 --> 09:31.352
can I tell the others
we're ready to start?

09:31.438 --> 09:32.841
Not just yet.

09:32.907 --> 09:37.095
You said once you had your
family back we would begin.

09:37.181 --> 09:38.286
Why not right away?

09:38.377 --> 09:40.041
Soon, huh?

09:41.615 --> 09:43.277
Soon?

09:43.442 --> 09:45.029
As in when?

09:45.496 --> 09:46.740
Joe, everyone in this house,

09:46.835 --> 09:50.277
they're anxious to get started,

09:51.480 --> 09:52.921
and they're growing impatient,

09:53.014 --> 09:54.147
right, Vince?

09:54.233 --> 09:55.258
Right down ornery.

09:55.364 --> 09:56.906
It's been a whole of
5 minutes, Roderick,

09:56.988 --> 09:58.965
so let's just table
this discussion

09:59.087 --> 10:01.219
for the moment, hmm?

10:02.052 --> 10:03.728
Joe...

10:05.219 --> 10:07.789
do you understand these people
have sacrificed for you?

10:09.622 --> 10:10.919
You owe them.

10:11.102 --> 10:12.934
You're responsible to them.

10:13.022 --> 10:13.817
It's selfish of you
to make--

10:13.933 --> 10:15.978
Enough!

10:18.024 --> 10:21.497
Now is there anything else?

10:50.784 --> 10:52.985
Okay. Good. You guys go ahead
and gear up, all right?

10:53.097 --> 10:55.547
Yeah. So we found
their hot spot.

10:55.669 --> 10:56.882
It's a building on the corner.

10:56.983 --> 10:58.274
Bandwidth coming
from that basement

10:58.365 --> 10:59.530
is beyond capacity.

10:59.622 --> 11:02.216
It's an after hours bar
listed to a Haley Mercury.

11:02.346 --> 11:03.552
Here are your earpieces.

11:03.744 --> 11:04.756
We got men on every exit

11:04.875 --> 11:06.173
and on the neighboring rooftops.

11:06.275 --> 11:08.233
All right. Hardy and I
will do the exploratory.

11:08.325 --> 11:09.411
Stay close.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.053
Okay, Lou. Get your
men around back.

11:12.429 --> 11:13.981
Okay, guys.
Round it up.

11:38.021 --> 11:39.177
Can I help you?

11:39.282 --> 11:41.327
We're looking
for Haley Mercury.

11:42.046 --> 11:43.611
Uh, she's in the office.

11:43.919 --> 11:44.969
I'll get her for you.

11:45.087 --> 11:46.036
Ma'am, stay where you are.

11:46.112 --> 11:48.026
She's running.
Secure all entrances.

11:50.727 --> 11:52.123
Get back against
the wall, lady.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.682
Hey!
Back!

12:04.045 --> 12:05.159
Get back.

12:23.937 --> 12:24.999
FBI!

12:25.429 --> 12:26.427
Ohh!

12:26.515 --> 12:28.305
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

12:28.794 --> 12:30.347
- Move it!
- I'm just a *.

12:37.502 --> 12:38.949
_

12:43.871 --> 12:44.824
Hands up!

12:44.914 --> 12:46.350
Okay.

12:47.479 --> 12:48.804
Don't shoot.

12:53.864 --> 12:54.735
There's a ghost server

12:54.834 --> 12:55.981
that piggybacks
the main server.

12:56.076 --> 12:56.909
All her information is buried

12:57.003 --> 12:58.407
in her international IPs.

12:58.524 --> 12:59.605
Can you trace the location?

12:59.705 --> 13:01.601
It's all moving through countries
that have no internet laws.

13:01.716 --> 13:03.581
It's a black hole,
but we can shut it down.

13:03.675 --> 13:06.237
No. Keep it in play. We need
to monitor all activity.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.571
This place is messed up.

13:07.675 --> 13:10.226
The woman is hardcore.
I count 14 felonies.

13:10.304 --> 13:11.730
Are you counting
the online business?

13:11.822 --> 13:13.409
She's running
an interactive fetish house.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.023
All right.
Let's go talk to her.

13:18.209 --> 13:19.237
We got this.

13:20.479 --> 13:21.944
So how do you know Joe Carroll?

13:22.034 --> 13:23.238
Is that what this is about?

13:23.338 --> 13:24.909
When was the last time you
were in contact with him?

13:24.997 --> 13:27.014
I don't know Joe Carroll, and
I don't want to know him.

13:27.111 --> 13:28.186
Then you need to
explain why his cult

13:28.305 --> 13:29.578
is using your internet server

13:29.685 --> 13:31.567
to hide his
online communication.

13:33.302 --> 13:35.468
That ass.
Damn him to hell.

13:35.562 --> 13:36.947
Who? Who?

13:38.448 --> 13:41.275
Look. I am not a part
of Joe Carroll's cult.

13:41.356 --> 13:42.638
You're looking at 20 years.

13:42.805 --> 13:44.351
You need to start to talking.

13:46.705 --> 13:48.822
I'll cooperate,
but I want a deal.

13:48.898 --> 13:53.093
Okay. Tease us. Give us something
deal-worthy, and maybe--

13:53.171 --> 13:54.583
You want Vince McKinnley.

13:54.706 --> 13:55.950
He freelances with me.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.175
I have some foreign clients.

13:57.256 --> 13:58.979
They're into
the hardcore illegal stuff.

13:59.070 --> 13:59.931
I call Vince.

14:00.020 --> 14:00.788
Are you aware Vince is wanted

14:00.884 --> 14:02.391
for kidnapping and murder?

14:03.804 --> 14:06.160
I had a feeling you'd
say something like that.

14:06.798 --> 14:09.422
It's those Joe Carroll
groupies he got mixed up with.

14:09.503 --> 14:11.022
So tell us
about his cult activity.

14:11.102 --> 14:12.805
I knew he had a Carroll fetish.

14:12.955 --> 14:15.386
I didn't know there was a cult
until I saw it on the news.

14:16.854 --> 14:18.842
Vince lives on the fringes.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.356
Did you know he
and his creepy brother

14:20.424 --> 14:22.833
were raised in a militia
in the mountains?

14:24.127 --> 14:25.969
He's had a tough life.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.567
So how long did you two date?

14:29.700 --> 14:34.559
Date? Aw.
That's cute.

14:35.006 --> 14:36.543
No, no.
We didn't date.

14:37.094 --> 14:39.144
We flogged each other.

14:40.105 --> 14:42.615
He can be quite submissive
when he wants to be.

14:42.825 --> 14:45.508
He set up my computer
and the server.

14:45.983 --> 14:48.213
I needed an untraceable
Tor system,

14:48.342 --> 14:49.488
and he knew that stuff.

14:49.599 --> 14:51.804
Would you be willing
to contact him for us?

14:51.921 --> 14:53.151
I'll do better than that.

14:53.299 --> 14:54.945
I can deliver him to you

14:56.277 --> 14:58.270
if we have a deal.

15:07.705 --> 15:09.909
Brought you some clothes,
some shoes.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.619
Joe picked this dress for you.

15:16.712 --> 15:17.776
What for?

15:17.911 --> 15:20.752
Well, he would like you to
join him for dinner tonight,

15:21.797 --> 15:23.470
thought you might
want to look nice.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.989
Does he think this is a game?

15:25.087 --> 15:26.170
You need to do this, Claire.

15:26.243 --> 15:27.961
I'm not doing anything
until I see my son.

15:28.380 --> 15:29.781
Not how this works.

15:33.371 --> 15:34.193
Unh!

15:35.412 --> 15:38.733
There are certain ground rules that
you need to understand, Claire.

15:38.848 --> 15:42.518
Now I can't cut
or bruise your face,

15:42.753 --> 15:45.448
but other than that,
Joe has given me permission

15:45.548 --> 15:47.811
to physically hurt you
when necessary.

15:49.036 --> 15:51.285
Be smart here, Claire.

15:51.930 --> 15:53.492
You want to see you son?

15:54.874 --> 15:56.269
Make an effort.

16:05.101 --> 16:06.261
How's Claire?

16:07.002 --> 16:08.067
She's fine.

16:09.071 --> 16:11.008
So Joe put you
in charge of her?

16:11.952 --> 16:13.417
That's a big deal.

16:14.197 --> 16:15.616
Good for you.

16:16.670 --> 16:18.420
Joe trusts me now, Emma.

16:21.037 --> 16:22.521
I don't understand.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.553
You're being weird.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.231
Why are you acting like this?

16:31.688 --> 16:33.134
I know you're upset,

16:34.186 --> 16:35.327
but...

16:36.837 --> 16:40.073
whatever happened,
you know I love you.

16:42.019 --> 16:44.227
The Jacob that you love
isn't here anymore.

16:45.246 --> 16:46.703
It's just me now.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.284
He uses this
address for deliveries.

16:56.135 --> 16:58.492
Some guy dropped
this off last week.

16:58.624 --> 17:00.117
I was gonna let him know,

17:00.540 --> 17:02.305
but then I saw the news.

17:03.328 --> 17:05.281
That cult stuff creeped me out.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.590
Sent. He'll respond
in minutes.

17:17.702 --> 17:19.064
He always does.

17:21.246 --> 17:22.128
What is it?

17:22.223 --> 17:23.308
Some kind of chemical,

17:23.395 --> 17:24.453
nitroglycerine maybe.

17:24.531 --> 17:26.528
Looks like it's
black-market.

17:26.632 --> 17:28.306
Used in car bombs,
hand grenades.

17:28.387 --> 17:31.191
It's candy to this guy.

17:31.277 --> 17:32.503
I mean, he's militia.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.635
Hey, man.
I need to make a run.

17:38.729 --> 17:40.031
I got a delivery.

17:40.883 --> 17:42.609
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

17:42.791 --> 17:44.702
Can I go?

17:46.132 --> 17:47.436
All right.

17:48.585 --> 17:49.895
Make it quick.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.258
Don't spend the night
with your little whore.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.501
You make your drop and
you get back here.

18:01.338 --> 18:03.295
Hey. Don't let-- don't
let Joe get you down.

18:05.031 --> 18:08.445
Don't put your filthy
fingers on me.

18:13.257 --> 18:14.737
What the hell, man?

18:15.933 --> 18:17.951
Were you beaten as a kid?

18:24.875 --> 18:27.030
I was just looking
for a new friend.

18:27.662 --> 18:29.299
Damn.

18:36.937 --> 18:38.200
Ha ha ha!

18:59.360 --> 19:00.948
You okay? You okay?

19:01.778 --> 19:04.223
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

19:06.435 --> 19:07.889
All right?

19:18.047 --> 19:20.641
So you're gonna follow
Vince to see where he goes?

19:20.800 --> 19:22.407
All you have to do is
give him his package,

19:22.523 --> 19:24.485
make some small talk, and
send him on his way.

19:24.585 --> 19:25.538
We'll take it from there.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.467
No worries. I role
play for a living.

19:28.555 --> 19:29.293
She's wired.

19:29.392 --> 19:31.530
We'll be able to hear everything
you say through these earpieces.

19:31.623 --> 19:32.671
You don't trust me, do you?

19:32.768 --> 19:33.877
Not for a second.

19:33.955 --> 19:34.659
In case something happens,

19:34.753 --> 19:35.886
we need some kind of code word.

19:35.970 --> 19:37.335
You mean like a safe word.

19:37.961 --> 19:38.932
A code word.

19:39.020 --> 19:40.351
That's standard around here.

19:40.420 --> 19:41.637
Green is "go," red is "stop,"

19:41.724 --> 19:44.361
yellow is "whoa, intense,
take it easy."

19:45.088 --> 19:46.551
So we'll go
with "red."

19:49.249 --> 19:50.856
Switched out
the nitrate compound.

19:50.962 --> 19:52.936
He won't know it's fake
till he tries to use it.

19:53.207 --> 19:54.976
I hope this works.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.354
Yeah. You
and me both.

20:22.652 --> 20:24.343
Hi, Joe.

20:29.414 --> 20:30.944
Hello, Claire.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.013
Sorry.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.527
It-- it's all right.

20:40.401 --> 20:43.065
Let's just take this slowly.

20:46.257 --> 20:48.927
May-- may I get
you a drink?

20:51.675 --> 20:54.191
Yes, please.

21:12.998 --> 21:15.614
Suspect's parked on the
south side of the street.

21:27.511 --> 21:28.808
Hey, Bruce.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.332
Now he's entered the club.

21:33.402 --> 21:34.582
Check is car.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.864
He just entered the back room.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.072
I don't hear enough sex!

22:10.472 --> 22:12.379
Let's get it oooon!

22:13.254 --> 22:16.144
A-ruff-ruff-ruff! Yeah!

22:18.158 --> 22:19.237
Haley honey.

22:19.325 --> 22:21.957
Hey, baby.
You got me freaking.

22:22.070 --> 22:23.302
Here we go.

22:23.378 --> 22:25.095
I can't be mixed
up in some murder cult.

22:25.180 --> 22:25.902
What are you crazy?

22:25.984 --> 22:27.349
The word cult is
ghastly inappropriate

22:27.435 --> 22:28.582
and offends me.

22:29.228 --> 22:30.598
We're more of a family.

22:32.673 --> 22:35.080
Ooh. Hmm.

22:35.924 --> 22:37.859
I do not have time for that.

22:37.945 --> 22:39.501
I have two bondage
parties tonight.

22:39.654 --> 22:42.595
Here it is.
Get rid of it.

22:42.693 --> 22:44.571
Oh. How about you help
me out to the car?

22:44.659 --> 22:46.097
No, I won't.

22:46.228 --> 22:51.122
Uh... well, how about you
hold the door open for me?

22:51.208 --> 22:53.071
Pretty please.

22:55.418 --> 22:57.316
Err-ruff!

23:07.947 --> 23:09.492
I've got a clean shot.

23:10.184 --> 23:11.373
Hang tight.

23:19.473 --> 23:20.444
Kiss?

23:20.547 --> 23:21.897
A hug.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.406
Mmm. Take care
of yourself, Vince.

23:24.667 --> 23:25.838
I worry about you.

23:25.947 --> 23:30.974
Well, come on.
Get in.

23:31.109 --> 23:31.936
What?

23:32.028 --> 23:33.935
Oh, the truth is
the FBI's gonna be

23:34.042 --> 23:35.992
crawling all over your ass
in a matter of time.

23:36.263 --> 23:38.003
I can keep you safe.

23:38.955 --> 23:40.209
Get in.

23:40.614 --> 23:41.650
Ha ha!

23:42.039 --> 23:42.748
Hey.

23:42.836 --> 23:44.805
Wait. Wait.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.272
Okay. This just went
from green to red.

23:48.376 --> 23:49.695
- We got to move.
- Wait.

23:49.810 --> 23:51.168
We intervene, we won't
be able to follow him.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.643
I'm not going with you.

23:52.878 --> 23:54.679
This is so red.
I have a busy night.

23:54.817 --> 23:56.576
Hey. Hey.
I said get in.

23:56.692 --> 23:57.572
He could kill her.

23:57.689 --> 23:58.736
We got to follow him.
He's all we got.

23:58.840 --> 23:59.767
We can't put her
life in jeopardy!

23:59.839 --> 24:02.040
He's a direct line to Joe!
We'll be right behind her.

24:03.029 --> 24:04.468
I won't ask you again.

24:05.261 --> 24:07.566
Okay. You're seeing
red, Vince.

24:07.666 --> 24:09.217
You're not thinking clearly.

24:09.756 --> 24:10.927
Well, hey.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.587
You're gonna thank
me later, okay?

24:18.388 --> 24:19.821
Get in the car.

24:22.273 --> 24:23.168
Get in.

24:25.525 --> 24:26.890
She's getting in the car.

24:26.981 --> 24:28.246
Do we move in?

24:30.571 --> 24:32.134
Stand down.

24:35.258 --> 24:36.608
We're gonna follow him.

24:38.112 --> 24:39.153
Let's go.

24:49.790 --> 24:51.271
Where are we going?

24:51.621 --> 24:54.261
Sss-somewhere safe.

24:55.747 --> 24:57.543
Back to the compound
or the cult house

24:57.649 --> 24:59.223
or whatever you call it?

24:59.743 --> 25:01.155
We'll be there soon.

25:09.771 --> 25:11.149
What is it?

25:11.246 --> 25:13.699
Just watching the cars,

25:13.778 --> 25:15.380
making sure that we're
not being followed.

25:15.467 --> 25:16.530
Who would be following us?

25:16.633 --> 25:17.949
I don't know.

25:18.210 --> 25:21.399
Okay? I get paranoid.

25:26.917 --> 25:31.329
Turner, tell everyone to
drop back a few miles.

25:31.424 --> 25:32.373
Ryan and I will stay on him,

25:32.459 --> 25:34.351
but our guy is getting
a little itchy.

25:35.390 --> 25:37.128
Please, Vince.

25:38.344 --> 25:41.352
If you care about me,
just let me go.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.473
That... doesn't
make sense.

25:46.473 --> 25:49.019
You don't let people
that you care about go.

25:54.544 --> 25:56.392
He's speeding up.
He's pulling away.

25:56.481 --> 25:59.145
We're not gonna lose them.
We got a GPS on her wire.

25:59.245 --> 26:00.198
If anything happens to her,

26:00.292 --> 26:02.262
it's on us, it's on me.

26:02.347 --> 26:04.913
We're not gonna let
anything happen to her.

26:06.385 --> 26:08.047
Okay?

26:33.552 --> 26:34.885
Here.
Take this light.

26:36.847 --> 26:38.231
What is this place?

26:38.375 --> 26:41.282
Oh. It's an old
military armory.

26:41.775 --> 26:43.069
It's pretty cool, right?

26:43.465 --> 26:44.542
Come on.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.134
Hey. I said come on.

27:01.335 --> 27:02.479
We've arrived.

27:02.570 --> 27:04.319
Abandoned property
off Route 17.

27:04.423 --> 27:05.575
Set a perimeter.

27:05.683 --> 27:08.273
I SWAT on site ASAP.

27:09.665 --> 27:11.251
What the hell is this place?

27:12.042 --> 27:13.842
It looks like an old armory.

27:41.186 --> 27:43.203
So is this where
the cult lives?

27:43.314 --> 27:45.838
No. Of course not.

27:46.114 --> 27:47.841
So what is this place?

27:48.291 --> 27:51.727
A munitions depot,
training grounds.

27:51.833 --> 27:53.429
Training for what?

27:53.571 --> 27:56.068
Well, what do you think, silly?

27:56.229 --> 27:57.468
Killing.

27:57.902 --> 28:02.093
So, uh, did you
train here, or--

28:02.186 --> 28:03.386
Me? No, no, no.

28:03.486 --> 28:05.303
Certain people, though,

28:05.424 --> 28:06.563
those who need it.

28:06.698 --> 28:08.729
Flip the light.
Get the light.

28:09.308 --> 28:11.720
Those who need it,
they got to be broken.

28:11.807 --> 28:14.989
We got to condition them
before they can be trusted.

28:29.469 --> 28:31.577
So where is everybody else?

28:31.748 --> 28:36.182
Oh, don't worry. Nobody's
gonna bother us. Come on.

28:36.273 --> 28:37.107
What are you doing?

28:37.191 --> 28:38.146
What do you think I'm doing?

28:38.230 --> 28:39.386
Stop, stop.

28:39.470 --> 28:40.310
Stop it!

28:40.396 --> 28:42.503
- Stop it, Vince!
- What the hell?

28:42.793 --> 28:43.886
What the hell?

28:43.980 --> 28:45.311
What is this?

28:46.840 --> 28:48.175
Is this a wire?

28:48.292 --> 28:50.105
We got to get in there.

28:53.371 --> 28:55.499
What did you do?
I trusted you.

28:55.587 --> 28:56.761
I'm sorry. The FBI.
They made--

29:00.922 --> 29:03.034
Who is this, FBI?

29:03.113 --> 29:05.682
Ryan Hardy, is that you?

29:05.869 --> 29:07.461
Well, this is
your fault, Hardy.

29:08.325 --> 29:10.999
She's a dead woman
because of you!

29:14.436 --> 29:15.844
Aah!

29:24.467 --> 29:25.914
Aah!

29:52.342 --> 29:53.548
No!

29:57.850 --> 29:58.948
She's alive!

29:59.077 --> 30:00.672
Haley, where's Vince?

30:00.786 --> 30:02.273
He's gone.

30:16.576 --> 30:18.259
"Red."
I said, "red."

30:18.363 --> 30:20.786
I said, "red,"
over and over an over again.

30:21.073 --> 30:21.879
I'm sorry,
but we--

30:21.978 --> 30:23.843
I don't care.
I said, "red"!

30:23.978 --> 30:25.243
I could be dead.

30:26.283 --> 30:26.929
But you're not.

30:27.069 --> 30:28.601
Only because he needed
to buy time.

30:29.062 --> 30:32.034
He said it would take longer
for you to help a live person

30:32.136 --> 30:34.375
than a dead person.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.762
My men are securing
the building now.

30:42.856 --> 30:44.445
I want property records ASAP.

30:44.547 --> 30:46.901
Get ERT here. I want every
inch of this place processed.

30:47.032 --> 30:48.261
Yes, ma'am.

30:56.293 --> 30:57.681
You're not hungry?

30:59.800 --> 31:01.198
Why are you doing this?

31:02.200 --> 31:05.305
Why this charade?
What's the point?

31:05.404 --> 31:07.422
You, Claire.
You're the point.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.682
No. I mean, all of it.

31:08.771 --> 31:10.848
I mean, this house and those
people, who are they?

31:10.948 --> 31:13.828
Well, you could call
them my friends,

31:13.896 --> 31:16.642
my family, people
I want to help.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.301
You mean, the crazy, psychotic,
unstable people out there?

31:19.391 --> 31:20.971
Who better to help them?

31:21.124 --> 31:23.967
There are so many people who
are lost in this world,

31:24.061 --> 31:26.308
so much hurt and violence.

31:26.845 --> 31:29.916
I'm just trying to bring
some order to it.

31:30.009 --> 31:34.058
I want them to know that
they are not alone.

31:34.161 --> 31:35.726
By teaching them how to kill?

31:38.188 --> 31:40.965
I do realize it's--
it's a lot for you

31:41.061 --> 31:42.109
to comprehend over dinner.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.669
No. It's impossible for me to
comprehend over dinner, Joe.

31:44.752 --> 31:45.909
You're crazy.
You know that.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.667
I suffer from a
monomaniacal need to kill.

31:50.768 --> 31:52.009
It will never go away.

31:52.086 --> 31:55.846
It will only
intensify with time,

31:56.814 --> 32:01.068
and so I choose to embrace it.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.547
Then why bring Joey into this,

32:02.647 --> 32:04.264
why bring me into this?

32:04.353 --> 32:05.932
Because I love you.

32:06.030 --> 32:06.861
I don't love you.

32:06.959 --> 32:10.010
Human emotions can be
conditioned, Claire.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.491
You will love me again.

32:23.912 --> 32:26.060
Joe...

32:26.345 --> 32:28.389
please let me see Joey.

32:31.723 --> 32:33.467
Good try, Claire,

32:33.785 --> 32:35.244
but I'm afraid that Joey is

32:35.336 --> 32:37.084
the only card I
have left to play,

32:37.167 --> 32:39.483
so I think I'm just
gonna hold onto it

32:39.569 --> 32:41.726
for a little bit longer.

32:41.865 --> 32:43.894
You want me to love
you again, Joe?

32:44.473 --> 32:46.702
Then you show me
that there is a shred

32:46.878 --> 32:48.536
of the man I married
inside of you

32:48.628 --> 32:50.098
because until then,
all of this,

32:50.182 --> 32:51.239
this dress,
this going to dinner,

32:51.334 --> 32:53.356
all of it,
this going to continue

32:53.464 --> 32:55.445
to be a charade
until I see my son!

32:55.554 --> 32:57.205
Bring me my son!

33:02.509 --> 33:04.322
Don't!

33:21.690 --> 33:23.104
Look at this.

33:23.786 --> 33:25.309
These are detonators.

33:25.401 --> 33:27.109
Do you think they're planning
some kind of major attack,

33:27.203 --> 33:30.776
or is this preemptive training?

33:30.897 --> 33:32.278
Well, they kept
extensive records.

33:32.384 --> 33:33.840
The got doctors' files,

33:34.054 --> 33:36.915
psych evals, endurance scores,

33:37.001 --> 33:39.587
deprivation training,
combat, tactical.

33:39.661 --> 33:41.737
It's like they're running
some kind of boot camp.

33:54.906 --> 33:57.035
Oh, my God!
You folks okay?

33:57.877 --> 33:59.339
Please!
Please let us out!

33:59.417 --> 34:00.388
How long have you been in here?

34:00.489 --> 34:01.938
Months. Please. They're
gonna kill us!

34:02.010 --> 34:02.874
No one's gonna hurt you.

34:02.954 --> 34:04.125
Let me get something
to open this up.

34:04.198 --> 34:05.481
I've got 3 victims...

34:10.168 --> 34:11.713
What-- what is it?
Say again.

34:11.833 --> 34:14.417
I've got 3 victims in
the basement in a cage.

34:14.525 --> 34:15.953
We're on our way.

34:18.701 --> 34:20.132
Wait up.

34:20.253 --> 34:21.581
Look at this schedule.

34:21.791 --> 34:25.187
Deprivation, lockdown,
two weeks.

34:25.937 --> 34:27.260
Don't open that cage.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.495
Wait. What did
you say?

34:31.563 --> 34:32.755
Do not open the cage!

34:32.831 --> 34:34.339
They're cult members!

34:34.757 --> 34:35.818
Let's go!

34:39.496 --> 34:41.589
No! Aah!

34:51.815 --> 34:53.295
Somebody, talk to me.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.203
What's going on?

34:55.801 --> 34:56.994
Okay. Fan out.

34:57.420 --> 34:58.856
Parker, take left.

35:33.805 --> 35:36.381
Ryan? Ryan,
you okay?

35:36.459 --> 35:38.210
Wasn't me.
I'm okay.

36:39.977 --> 36:41.404
Aah! Ohh!

36:42.094 --> 36:43.347
Parker?!

36:45.165 --> 36:46.847
Aah! Ohh!

36:50.500 --> 36:52.089
Unh! Aah!

37:01.281 --> 37:02.096
Behind you!

37:06.520 --> 37:08.076
You okay?

37:24.159 --> 37:25.099
You wanted to see me?

37:25.205 --> 37:27.301
Oh, yes.
I just received a call

37:27.424 --> 37:29.457
from Vince.

37:29.647 --> 37:30.855
He was in something of a panic.

37:30.950 --> 37:32.383
He told that we
should shut down

37:32.477 --> 37:34.666
the satellite remote
immediately.

37:35.313 --> 37:36.215
Why?

37:36.334 --> 37:39.147
The FBI discovered
the server in New York,

37:40.774 --> 37:42.923
which led them to the camp.

37:46.361 --> 37:50.085
There is-- there is no way
they can find the camp.

37:50.177 --> 37:51.293
It's impossible.

37:51.381 --> 37:53.023
Vince led them there.

37:55.689 --> 37:58.192
Vince was, uh, making a run.

38:01.084 --> 38:02.772
There's nothing for
you to worry about.

38:02.862 --> 38:04.369
Are you certain of that?

38:04.466 --> 38:06.757
Yes, I am.

38:07.126 --> 38:10.257
Tell me did, um-- did you
give Vince permission

38:10.916 --> 38:12.590
to go to New York?

38:17.059 --> 38:19.440
Hmm. Hmm.

38:21.418 --> 38:22.928
Unh.

38:24.059 --> 38:27.970
You don't make decisions
anymore, Roderick.

38:28.831 --> 38:30.966
I am here now.

38:33.053 --> 38:34.754
Is that clear?

38:35.770 --> 38:38.175
Because if you
ruin this for me...

38:39.473 --> 38:41.693
Don't you mean for us?

39:00.988 --> 39:02.074
You good?

39:02.533 --> 39:04.448
No. Heh heh.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.121
I'm not gonna lie.

39:06.222 --> 39:08.546
That scared the hell out
of me in there tonight.

39:09.282 --> 39:10.884
We lost two men,

39:11.436 --> 39:13.456
and those people from the cage,

39:13.895 --> 39:15.199
they're all dead.

39:15.533 --> 39:17.022
Let's get some rest.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.452
DC is on their way.

39:18.568 --> 39:19.787
We'll start back
in the morning.

39:19.877 --> 39:20.913
Yeah.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.447
Hey.

39:22.856 --> 39:24.425
I told you I needed you.

39:26.662 --> 39:28.049
Thank you.

39:40.403 --> 39:43.122
I really do believe in my heart

39:43.935 --> 39:46.426
that you will love me again.

39:54.123 --> 39:55.460
Mom!

39:55.556 --> 39:56.885

Oh, I missed you.

40:10.989 --> 40:12.208
