WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:09.377
You know, I have to confess,
I don't know these movies
as well as you.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.946
Oh, it doesn't get sexier
than Dirk Montagne and
Margaret Holloway.

00:12.946 --> 00:16.417
They made five films together,
all written and directed
by James Desmond Wheeler.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.720
I think I may have seen
"Mayhem at the Mocambo."

00:19.720 --> 00:22.656
Ah, that was the first.
Then they did "Broadway
Bound and Gagged,"

00:22.656 --> 00:25.025
"The Achilles High Heel,"
"Trapeze, Anyone?,"

00:25.025 --> 00:26.794
and finally, "The Found,
the Lost, and the Looking,"

00:26.794 --> 00:28.296
which is what we're seeing.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.898
Hi, two please.
And how do you know
all these movies?

00:30.898 --> 00:35.069
My grandmother and I
used to stay up and watch
the late night movie together.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.771
How come we don't watch
more movies together?

00:37.771 --> 00:40.708
Saving the world doesn't
give us a lot of downtime.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.710
Flynn:
That's true.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.582
You know,
popcorn has a history
that goes back 8,000 years.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.118
- Rather fascinating, really.
- I disagree.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.385
It wasn't until
the Great Depression

00:51.385 --> 00:53.287
that popcorn made its way
into movie houses.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.855
Up until then,
they wanted to cater
to more of an upscale--

00:54.855 --> 00:56.724
My darling,
may I interrupt you
for a moment?

00:56.724 --> 00:59.627
- Of course.
- You need a break
from your intellect

00:59.627 --> 01:01.795
- even more than I do.
- What does that mean?

01:01.795 --> 01:05.166
Well, we've been saying we
should act like normal people,

01:05.166 --> 01:07.701
do normal people things.
Let's start tonight.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.538
I'm not a Guardian,
you're not a Librarian.
We're just two--

01:10.538 --> 01:14.041
The Librarian.
You said "a" Librarian.
Like I'm some kind of--

01:14.041 --> 01:16.944
The Librarian. Him. Him.
Don't be a him tonight.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.612
Just be normal.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.581
Movies aren't meant
to be dissected.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.517
They're meant to wash over you
like a wave

01:23.517 --> 01:26.120
until you're totally immersed
in the story,

01:26.120 --> 01:28.556
swimming in the characters.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.890
Can you do that?

01:29.890 --> 01:33.127
I might have
to take Dramamine,
but I think I can try.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.563
Flynn, that's all I ask.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.565
Excuse us.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.037
( exhales )

01:44.037 --> 01:47.241
( noir music playing )

01:54.715 --> 01:57.185
( thunder )

01:57.185 --> 01:59.320
Man:
It was a dark
and rainy night,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.322
but then, isn't it always

02:01.322 --> 02:02.956
( in unison )
when trouble comes to call?

02:02.956 --> 02:06.560
Shh!

02:06.560 --> 02:08.796
Trouble never
calls itself trouble.

02:08.796 --> 02:12.733
( in unison )
This time, it came in desperate
and damp on three-inch heels

02:12.733 --> 02:15.369
calling itself Madeline.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.305
Shh!

02:25.979 --> 02:28.148
Sorry, did that hurt?

02:28.148 --> 02:31.385
Hurt?
Baby, I'm not even ticklish.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.726
( slurping )

02:40.361 --> 02:43.564
( sultry music playing )

02:51.639 --> 02:55.276
To the found, the lost,
and the looking.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.614
( knocking )

03:02.283 --> 03:05.219
( crowd murmuring )

03:05.219 --> 03:08.322
( screaming )

03:08.322 --> 03:11.325
( theme music playing )

03:18.466 --> 03:20.033
Ezekiel:
They're not picking up.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.002
Still feels a little weird
that we're checking up on them.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.604
Well, they've been gone a day.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.473
It's not like Flynn
and Baird to disappear.

03:25.473 --> 03:28.041
Plus they missed
the tethering ceremony
rehearsal.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.978
Well, Baird did say that they
were going to take the Metro
into Hollywood

03:30.978 --> 03:32.580
to see an old movie, so...

03:32.580 --> 03:35.849
"James Desmond Wheeler:
A Retrospective."
Bet this is it.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.652
- They took the Metro?
- Yeah, it's like
the magic door,

03:38.652 --> 03:42.189
only it's slower
and it smells like pee.

03:42.189 --> 03:46.760
- Whoa.
- Box office doesn't open
for another ten minutes.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.162
Thank you.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.399
What are you here to see?

03:51.399 --> 03:53.501
Oh, I'm going to see them all.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.304
Read about the reopening of
this theater and who bought it.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.606
Quite interesting.

03:58.606 --> 04:02.142
Hi, folks, hi.
Thanks for coming.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.977
Unfortunately,
due to a problem

04:03.977 --> 04:06.079
with our projector
in theater one,

04:06.079 --> 04:09.049
today's showings
of "The Found, the Lost,
and the Looking"

04:09.049 --> 04:11.419
- are-- are canceled.
- Crowd: Aww.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.554
But-- but "Chaps In Chaps!"
in theater two

04:13.554 --> 04:16.089
and "Brain Robbers
From Planet Xenon Alpha Six"

04:16.089 --> 04:19.727
in theater three
are still working fine.
Let's hope.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.829
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, hi.
- Yes? Hi.

04:21.829 --> 04:25.366
We're with
the American Film Library.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.869
- Yeah.
- Uh... Institute.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.472
The-- we're looking for
a couple of colleagues.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.707
- They came here last night.
- Can you describe them?

04:33.707 --> 04:37.077
Tall blonde,
goofy know-it-all.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.279
Come with me.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.751
I'm so glad you're here.
I didn't know who to call.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.319
I didn't want to turn
anything off.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.754
Something go wrong
in one of the theaters?

04:46.754 --> 04:49.089
Three years of extensive,
expensive renovation

04:49.089 --> 04:50.524
open only for one day--

04:50.524 --> 04:52.926
I was a studio executive
for 20 years before that.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.863
Oh, I thought I'd seen it all.
My name is Jade Wells,
by the way.

04:55.863 --> 04:59.232
- What exactly happened?
- It's pretty self-explanatory.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.369
Is anybody even out there?

05:01.369 --> 05:03.637
Can anybody even hear me?

05:03.637 --> 05:06.840
Baird: Somebody!
Flynn, do something!

05:06.840 --> 05:08.809
What do you expect me to do,
Eve, jump through the screen?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.144
I tried that
and hurt my knees both times.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.415
Flynn!

05:14.415 --> 05:16.316
- Baird!
- They can't hear you.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.318
Or see you.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.287
They've been fighting
like that all night.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.223
- Oh, this is not good.
- What-- how did they
get in there?

05:23.223 --> 05:24.692
And how do we get them out?

05:24.692 --> 05:27.227
More importantly,
what the hell is Flynn doing?

05:27.227 --> 05:31.665
( screaming )

05:31.665 --> 05:35.403
I've heard of situations
where people live out a story,

05:35.403 --> 05:38.038
but being stuck inside?
That's completely new.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.408
Protocol demands we take
a disciplined approach.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.843
I have a theory
about the power source.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.181
Los Angeles sits in a basin

05:48.181 --> 05:50.818
defined by the sloping
Santa Monica mountains
to the west

05:50.818 --> 05:52.986
and the San Gabriels
to the north and east.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.789
Historically,
Los Angeles has collected
everything from dinosaur bones

05:55.789 --> 05:58.358
to smog in it's, uh,
bowl-like shape.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.761
And ley energy
is no exception.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.531
It's pooled in these massive
subterranean ley lakes,

06:03.531 --> 06:06.199
one of which is located
directly at the coordinates

06:06.199 --> 06:10.337
of 34.1015 degrees north

06:10.337 --> 06:14.608
by 118.3365 degrees west.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.376
The Hollywood Wax Museum.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.311
That's all we need.
Super-charged wax figures

06:18.311 --> 06:19.680
of Tom Cruise
and Charlton Heston.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.715
And on the opposite corner,
you guessed it,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.451
the Hollywood Movie Palace.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.253
Designed in the 1920s,
it was a faux-Moroccan style,

06:26.253 --> 06:27.855
originally opened
as the Alcazar.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.958
Three years ago, it was
purchased by a Jade Wells.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.026
She reopened it
as the Hollywood Movie Palace,

06:33.026 --> 06:37.064
and it's now a revival house
dedicated to the works
of forgotten masters.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.732
Forgotten?
Try never heard of.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.267
Who's ever heard
of James Desmond Wheeler?

06:40.267 --> 06:42.202
I have.

06:42.202 --> 06:46.974
Yes, uh, the films
of James Desmond Wheeler,
I'm very familiar with.

06:46.974 --> 06:51.211
After helming a string of really
poor box office performers,

06:51.211 --> 06:55.816
he was relegated
to directing B-westerns,
sci-fi monster movies.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.819
Made his last film in 1969,
which turned out to be

06:58.819 --> 07:01.622
- the surf biker cult classic
"Hang Ten To Zuma."
- Oh!

07:01.622 --> 07:03.190
He was married,
had a daughter.

07:03.190 --> 07:07.027
And he and his wife adopted.
He died on March 12, 1979

07:07.027 --> 07:10.363
in Saugus, California,
right off Interstate 5
near Magic Mountain.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.632
- Oh, Magic Mountain!
- No.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.701
Ley lakes account
for the location,

07:13.701 --> 07:15.836
but for Flynn and Baird
to get sucked into celluloid,

07:15.836 --> 07:18.405
I mean, that would be
the job of one of these
new artifacts right?

07:18.405 --> 07:22.375
And I reckon Jade's already
told us what it is,
the projectors.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.945
It could be anything.
It doesn't have to be--
it could be the chandelier.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.980
It could be the seats.
Hell, it could be
the stage curtain.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.283
It is literally the division
between substance and fantasy.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.619
It was the screen.

07:31.619 --> 07:32.853
The focal point
of all of those viewers

07:32.853 --> 07:34.855
over all of those decades,
I mean,

07:34.855 --> 07:36.790
it would imbue it with
an incredible amount
of psychic energy.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.728
Whatever the artifact is,
we are now certain
where it is.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.462
Right.
So we go into the theater,

07:42.462 --> 07:43.964
rub on anything magicky,
and get sucked into--

07:43.964 --> 07:46.299
No, my foolish friend.
Our job is to get them out.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.201
Not lose anyone else
to its grasp.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.204
- But how?
- Well, according
to Library lore,

07:51.204 --> 07:55.075
in a case of literal narrative
transference like this,
there is only one way.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.879
We must help
bring the movie's story
to its intended conclusion.

07:58.879 --> 08:03.383
It must end exactly
as it was intended.
No changes.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.353
- Why can't anyone hear us?
- ( saxophone playing )

08:06.353 --> 08:09.089
Eve, my arm is throbbing.

08:09.089 --> 08:13.193
And will whoever is playing
that incessant saxophone
please stop?

08:13.193 --> 08:15.162
- ( saxophone stops )
- How about a drink?

08:15.162 --> 08:16.429
Oh, I would love one,

08:16.429 --> 08:17.798
but my Fanta is out there

08:17.798 --> 08:19.199
and I don't have
a 300-foot straw.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.001
How about a real drink?
There's a bottle in

08:21.001 --> 08:23.136
the bottom left drawer
of your desk, smart guy.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.105
And two glasses
in the top right, remember?

08:25.105 --> 08:28.676
- ( thunder )
- I know everything
about this office.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.644
I've seen it ten times.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.080
And I don't think we're going
about this the right way.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.482
I don't think the way out...

08:35.482 --> 08:37.184
is out there.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.288
I think the way out...

08:44.091 --> 08:46.960
is out there.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.495
Of course.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.763
Why didn't I think
of this before?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.699
Protocol for literal
narrative transference.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.602
Eve, you've been studying
Library lore.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.804
- Yep.
- All we have to do
is finish the movie.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.372
As Kitty and Mac.
Do everything exactly
as they did.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.208
Trigger the next event
and then the next until
we reach a conclusion.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.944
- Okay, so what happens next?
- Outside that door

09:03.944 --> 09:07.748
is sultry chanteuse
and divorcée Madeline Kincaid.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.950
But Madeline doesn't
enter the scene

09:09.950 --> 09:12.519
until after
I've poured you a drink.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.588
And I don't pour you a drink

09:14.588 --> 09:17.457
until after I've removed
a bullet from your arm, so...

09:17.457 --> 09:20.193
Ah-ha, hey, Eve.
I mean, Kitty.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.429
Let's, uh, let's talk
this over for a minute, huh?

09:22.429 --> 09:23.631
- I mean, come on, huh?
- Shh.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.066
I mean, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.768
Flynn, no more.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.771
You're Mac Doyle,
and Mac Doyle doesn't feel
any fear.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.906
He buried it under
the Ardennes in '44

09:32.906 --> 09:36.043
and replaced that fear
with a flinty,
hard-edged realism.

09:36.043 --> 09:40.313
He's decisive, smart,
strong, witty,

09:40.313 --> 09:43.617
capable,
a master of trapeze.

09:43.617 --> 09:46.687
You need to be Mac
and I need to be Kitty.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.722
And we need to play
these roles to the hilt

09:48.722 --> 09:50.590
because, baby, digging
a bullet out of your arm

09:50.590 --> 09:52.926
is only the beginning,
act one, scene one.

09:52.926 --> 09:57.064
And we got a long way to go.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.066
( thunder )

10:01.201 --> 10:03.203
( exhales deeply )

10:05.538 --> 10:07.074
( exhales sharply )

10:09.442 --> 10:11.979
( grunts )
You know, in the movie,

10:11.979 --> 10:14.748
Margaret Holloway
really seemed to be able

10:14.748 --> 10:17.050
to just... pluck it
right out of there.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.220
Maybe because Dirk Montagne
never said anything

10:20.220 --> 10:23.356
that wasn't fabulously charming
or dangerously alluring.

10:23.356 --> 10:27.928
Oh, no?
How did Dirk wittily handle
dizziness from blood loss?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.229
Look at my skin.
I'm ashen.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.598
You're not ashen.
You're in black and white.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.033
And you're breaking character.
Follow the script.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.368
I say,
"Sorry, did that hurt?"

10:35.368 --> 10:37.270
And then you say,
"Baby, I--"

10:37.270 --> 10:38.739
"Baby, I'm not even ticklish!"

10:38.739 --> 10:39.907
Yes, I know, and then
the bullet will come out?

10:39.907 --> 10:42.542
Exactly! Yes, yes.
Yes. Are you ready?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.745
( whimpers )

10:49.482 --> 10:51.651
Sorry, did that hurt?

10:51.651 --> 10:56.056
( yells )
Baby, baby, baby!

10:56.056 --> 10:57.490
Baby, baby, baby,
I'm not-- I'm not--

10:57.490 --> 10:59.860
( babbling )

10:59.860 --> 11:02.295
I'm not even-- I'm not--
I'm not even ticklish!

11:02.295 --> 11:04.464
Oh, I got it!

11:04.464 --> 11:07.801
Now I pour the drinks.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.536
Okay, and what am I
supposed to do now?

11:09.536 --> 11:12.706
Hey, now you look deep
into my eyes

11:12.706 --> 11:15.809
and you say,
"Here's to the found,

11:15.809 --> 11:17.845
the lost,
and the looking."

11:17.845 --> 11:19.813
And then we toast.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.782
Here's to the found,
the lost, and looking."

11:21.782 --> 11:23.616
( knocking )

11:23.616 --> 11:27.454
Hello? Is anyone in?

11:27.454 --> 11:28.455
( chuckles )

11:31.658 --> 11:34.261
Mr. Doyle, I--
I need your help.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.329
Okay, Madeline Kincaid,

11:36.329 --> 11:39.632
daughter of eccentric
millionaire inventor
Dr. Preston Kincaid is here,

11:39.632 --> 11:41.334
desperate to find
a priceless ruby necklace

11:41.334 --> 11:44.304
she suspects was stolen
by notorious gangster/
night club owner

11:44.304 --> 11:47.407
Anthony Schazzola,
A.K.A., Tony The Shaz.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.576
- Okay.
- Also, she's going to
flirt with you

11:49.576 --> 11:51.178
and ask you to meet her
at her bungalow

11:51.178 --> 11:53.480
- back at
The Ambassador Hotel.
- ( chuckles )

11:53.480 --> 11:56.316
Do I go to The Amb--
no, I wouldn't go to
The Ambassador Hotel.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.985
Well, how would you suggest
that I play this?

11:57.985 --> 12:00.720
I'd suggest carefully
and cool.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.090
- Gotcha. Improv time.
- No! No, no. Opposite.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.625
Opposite of improv.
Flynn-- Mac,

12:05.625 --> 12:07.360
promise me you'll stick
to the script

12:07.360 --> 12:09.897
- and wait for my prompts.
- I understand.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.165
Careful and cool.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.501
( thunder )

12:14.501 --> 12:16.503
Ahem, come in.

12:18.772 --> 12:22.843
Mr. Doyle?
Mr. Mac Doyle?

12:22.843 --> 12:26.279
- Maybe yes and maybe no.
- Ahem.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.115
Let's say yes.

12:28.115 --> 12:31.618
And unless I miss my guess,
you are sultry
Madeline Kincaid,

12:31.618 --> 12:35.322
desperate daughter
of Dr. Millionaire
Preston Kincaid,

12:35.322 --> 12:39.126
and you are here...

12:39.126 --> 12:41.895
- looking for something.
- Very good, Mr. Doyle.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.931
I'll come straight
to the point.

12:43.931 --> 12:48.235
A certain gentleman
connected to the gaming world
has something of mine, and...

12:48.235 --> 12:50.137
I want it back.

12:50.137 --> 12:54.875
Are you familiar
with a Mr. Schazzola?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.776
Tony The Shaz, yes.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.380
And unless I miss my guess,
he been dabbling in
the jewelry trade,

13:00.380 --> 13:01.982
if you catch my drift.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.852
I feel an immediate ease
with you, Mr. Doyle.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.753
Like we have
a mental shorthand.

13:06.753 --> 13:10.490
We're clearly connected.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.826
I want back what's mine,
Mr. Doyle.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.095
You can name your price.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.297
I keep a bungalow
at The Ambassador.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.300
Hello!
I'm surprised Mac hasn't
introduced us.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.503
Kitty Dupree,
Mac's long time associate.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.506
Associate? I see.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.042
Then I'm sure you can
quote me the going rate.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.144
50 bucks a day
plus expenses.

13:31.144 --> 13:35.182
And yet it's clear as gin
you're worth ever so much more.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.451
As I said,
I keep a bungalow
at The Ambassador.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.453
You can reach me there...

13:40.453 --> 13:42.655
( thunder )

13:42.655 --> 13:44.524
- at night.
- ( chuckles )

13:46.359 --> 13:48.595
Good day, Miss Dupree.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.537
Ha-ha.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.507
- Ahem. She didn't seem so bad.
- That's what I thought, too,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.109
but then she takes a turn
you don't see coming,

14:02.109 --> 14:04.677
and then it turns out
it was her all along.

14:04.677 --> 14:09.116
Ah.
Okay, angel face,
where to next?

14:09.116 --> 14:11.184
Or shall I make a wager?

14:11.184 --> 14:14.087
Even odds we're headed
to Long Beach

14:14.087 --> 14:16.823
to a floating casino
called "The SS Tango"

14:16.823 --> 14:19.392
for our first dance
with Tony The Shaz.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.528
- How'd you know that?
- This room is full of clues.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.264
Plus, there's kind of
a formula to these things.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.532
Do I get a gun?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.500
Top desk drawer.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.502
( thunder )

14:40.647 --> 14:42.649
( noir music playing )

14:44.484 --> 14:47.054
( foghorn blares )

14:47.054 --> 14:49.522
You don't scare me.
You're pathetic.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.892
- Go ahead and shoot.
- Don't do it, Madeline.
You can still walk away.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.795
It's too late.
I can't go back. I won't.

14:55.795 --> 14:58.398
Tony: You're all bluff.
Take away your daddy's money
and what are you?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.867
A so-so singer
with too much past
and too little future.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.302
- Shut up.
- No husband.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.404
- I mean it, shut up!
- No talent.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.373
- And no kid.
- ( groans )

15:09.642 --> 15:12.245
( gasps, groans )

15:27.294 --> 15:29.396
Wow.
I did not see that coming.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.298
Seemed it was going
a different way.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.033
Yeah, well nevertheless,
we must find a way

15:33.033 --> 15:35.468
to communicate the plot
to Mr. Carson and
Colonel Baird.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.936
I still say we go in.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
Now we know the ending,
we can help them get to
the right spots.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.908
All we have to do is rig
the back door just like Flynn
did with Charlene.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.276
We anchor it to Flynn
and Baird's things,

15:43.276 --> 15:45.112
which is full
of their psychic mojo.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.546
- Actually, that's true.
- No, it's not--

15:46.546 --> 15:48.315
please, listen to me,
that is too risky.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.916
So what do you suggest,
Jenkins?

15:49.916 --> 15:51.884
You say they're trapped
in the opening scene,

15:51.884 --> 15:55.422
in the office.
We need the exact date and time
from the production report,

15:55.422 --> 15:58.758
a Tenite thermoplastic
Western Electric model 307,

15:58.758 --> 16:02.629
and a force powerful enough
to catalyze temporal induction.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.131
What are you saying,
Jenkins?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.066
We might be able
to call them.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.307
- This is so cool.
- It really is.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.742
How long does the drive
take in the movie?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.044
About three minutes.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.345
Since they're on their way
to a casino,

16:18.345 --> 16:20.280
they talk a lot
about Mac's gambling problem,

16:20.280 --> 16:22.415
which was a big theme
in their last movie together,

16:22.415 --> 16:23.750
"Trapeze, Anyone?"

16:23.750 --> 16:25.718
I see.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.388
Hey, do you think this car just
knows where to go on its own?

16:28.388 --> 16:30.390
- Why do you ask?
- Well, it feels like
I'm driving,

16:30.390 --> 16:34.394
but there's only one road.
Pretty clear which way to go.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.429
If I took my hands off
this wheel,

16:36.429 --> 16:39.666
think the car would just take us
to the water taxi stand
on the harbor?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.634
Or would we crash?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.970
I think if it feels
like you're driving,
you probably are.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.538
I wouldn't test it.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.540
You're right.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.698
- Flynn!
- ( tires screeching )

17:13.066 --> 17:16.936
( line ringing )

17:16.936 --> 17:20.473
Well, it's been 15 minutes.

17:20.473 --> 17:24.544
Either they can't answer
or they've already progressed
to the next scene.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.149
Miss Cillian? Ezekiel?

17:45.432 --> 17:48.501
- This is not good.
- We're in the wrong movie!

17:48.501 --> 17:51.037
- This is "Chaps In Chaps!"
- Oh, you think?

17:51.037 --> 17:53.640
Tex Mangrove
and Dandy Dan O'Flannaghan,

17:53.640 --> 17:56.976
you've been found guilty
and are hereby sentenced to hang

17:56.976 --> 17:58.611
until such a time
as you are dead.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.047
Guess you won't be singing
yourselves out of this one.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.316
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

18:03.316 --> 18:04.951
I've never seen
"Chaps In Chaps!"

18:04.951 --> 18:08.188
May God have mercy
on your troubled souls.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.391
( Western music playing )

18:24.571 --> 18:27.039
- ( gunshots )
- ( women screaming )

18:27.039 --> 18:30.210
Look out, men!
It's Lacey McCallister!

18:30.210 --> 18:33.913
( gunfire )

18:33.913 --> 18:35.882
- Ahh!
- ( grunts )

18:35.882 --> 18:38.885
( gunfire )

18:44.557 --> 18:47.827
( yelling )

18:47.827 --> 18:49.729
Ahh!

18:49.729 --> 18:52.465
Did you see that?
It was incredible.
I couldn't miss.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.368
This is exactly
what I was afraid of,

18:55.368 --> 18:57.069
but do they ever listen?

18:57.069 --> 18:58.805
I'm sure Colonel Baird
and Mr. Carson

18:58.805 --> 19:00.540
are faring no better.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.742
Flynn:
So what happens
in this scene?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.545
We talk our way in
using aliases saying
we need to see the boss,

19:05.545 --> 19:08.281
and then he sends
for us at the bar.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.350
- Wait, what are the aliases?
- Names, please.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.386
Yes, sir.
May I please introduce
you to my fiancée

19:13.386 --> 19:16.389
- Lady Gaga Van Damme.
- And you are?

19:16.389 --> 19:19.058
Dr. Julius Erving III.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.627
I'm sorry, doctor, but--

19:20.627 --> 19:23.363
We have urgent business
to discuss with Mr. Schazzola.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.031
Mr. Schazzola
is a very busy man.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.867
So am I!
And I didn't water taxi
through three miles of chop

19:27.867 --> 19:30.837
to listen to any flunky lip,
so unless you want to paddle
that clipboard

19:30.837 --> 19:32.705
back to the mainland,
I suggest you find
Tony The Shaz

19:32.705 --> 19:37.744
and tell him that Dr. J
and Lady Gaga are at the bar...

19:37.744 --> 19:39.612
having drinks.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.581
( wolf howls )

19:41.581 --> 19:44.016
This is crazy.
We're cooking a weasel.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.053
And what, we're supposed to
just wait out here all night?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.655
Beautiful country,
isn't it?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.790
Look, where do we think
this story goes next?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.993
Well, hopefully Jenkins
fixes the door and
we don't have to find out.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.129
( Western music playing )

19:57.129 --> 19:58.665
Where is that music
coming from?

19:58.665 --> 20:02.068
Stone:
I feel there's
a song coming on.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.472
* They said he had no mother

20:05.472 --> 20:08.040
* But grew
from a dusty plain *

20:08.040 --> 20:11.544
- Stone, what are you doing?
- * And no jail
that'll hold him *

20:11.544 --> 20:14.747
* Or slow him
with ball and chain *

20:14.747 --> 20:18.285
* Behind the gun for hire
is a burning raging fire *

20:18.285 --> 20:21.120
* That even he
could not contain *

20:21.120 --> 20:23.990
* Whoa

20:23.990 --> 20:26.959
* Tex Mangrove was his name

20:26.959 --> 20:29.462
* Ah, ah

20:29.462 --> 20:33.766
* Tex Mangrove was his name

20:33.766 --> 20:35.234
( wolf howls )

20:35.234 --> 20:40.440
( yodeling )

20:53.620 --> 20:56.589
- ( continues yodeling )
- ( wolf howls )

20:59.792 --> 21:01.260
Is everything all right?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.363
We'll figure out the glitch
and open again soon.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.866
- Well, I had hoped that--
- I know, I promise.
As soon as possible.

21:06.866 --> 21:10.403
Why is this happening?
Was this an old Indian
burial ground?

21:10.403 --> 21:11.871
Was the marquee
hit by lightning? What?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.205
I think it is safe to say

21:13.205 --> 21:14.707
that there is
an unknown force at work.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.444
The question is why here?
Why now?

21:17.444 --> 21:19.612
- Why these films?
- I have no idea.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.614
- My father would have
loved it, though.
- Your father?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.384
My father was
James Desmond Wheeler.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.326
Okay, they bring us back.
We ask them about the necklace.

21:33.326 --> 21:36.295
They get suspicious,
search you, find the gun,
rough you up.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.130
I slip out, go below deck.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.334
How bad does it get?

21:41.334 --> 21:43.235
I'm not gonna lie,
you won't like it.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.537
Okay, what exactly
are the rules here?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.205
I can't drive
into oncoming traffic,

21:46.205 --> 21:48.675
but I can somehow
get away with calling you
Lady Gaga Van Damme?

21:48.675 --> 21:50.443
It appears we have
some leeway in our actions

21:50.443 --> 21:52.111
provided we adhere
to the major plot points.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.246
And getting
the hell kicked out of me
is a major plot point?

21:54.246 --> 21:55.682
- Right.
- Okay, what happens next?

21:55.682 --> 21:57.417
Then they throw you
over the side.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.118
- What?
- Don't worry.

21:59.118 --> 22:02.489
I pick you up halfway to shore
in an inflatable rubber dinghy.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.391
So after being beaten,
I only have to swim

22:04.391 --> 22:05.992
for a mile and a half
through freezing water?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.193
- Right.
- And what are you doing

22:07.193 --> 22:08.995
the entire time
I'm getting worked over?

22:08.995 --> 22:12.231
I investigate
and determine Schazzola's
moll has the rubies.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.466
But we already know that!

22:13.466 --> 22:15.402
What do you want me to say,
Flynn?

22:15.402 --> 22:18.571
Mac. No Lara Croft
movies back then.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.607
Women did the sleuthing,
men did the punching.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.409
Well, I don't see why I--

22:22.409 --> 22:24.644
( dramatic music playing )

22:24.644 --> 22:26.779
The Shaz will see you now.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.189
Do you know my father's work
well, Mr. Jenkins?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.726
Well, I rank
"The Achilles High Heel"

22:39.726 --> 22:42.261
and "Tis of Thee" among
the highest in their genres.

22:42.261 --> 22:45.264
Ooh, good taste.
You know, it's funny the three
that are running now

22:45.264 --> 22:46.633
are amongst
my least favorite.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.635
The music in
"Chaps In Chaps!"
is good, though.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.070
And the natural
dapple of light in
the ambush is very nice.

22:51.070 --> 22:55.074
I wonder, would you have any
of the original production
reports or scripts

22:55.074 --> 22:58.778
- from your father's films?
- I have it all.

23:01.648 --> 23:04.717
This isn't a town.
I want to play
cowboy in a town.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.655
Hang on, Dandy Dan.
I got a good feeling
about this place.

23:08.655 --> 23:12.291
- It feels safe here.
- Oh, I hear what
you're saying, Lacey.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.861
Or... Cassie.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.664
Yes, ma'am.
A man can lay down
some roots here.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.198
- There they are!
- Let's get 'em!

23:19.198 --> 23:20.700
( gunfire )

23:20.700 --> 23:23.169
- Ambush! Go!
- Ahh!

23:23.169 --> 23:27.139
( gunfire )

23:27.139 --> 23:28.240
- The loo!
- What?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.509
- The dunny!
- What?

23:29.509 --> 23:31.644
The poop shack over there!

23:31.644 --> 23:33.179
Jenkins must have patched us
through to the right movie.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.181
All right, you guys make
a run for it. I'll cover you.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.650
- Take Frannie.
- Okay.

23:37.650 --> 23:41.854
- ( shouting )
- ( gunfire )

23:48.094 --> 23:49.496
( shouting )

23:52.098 --> 23:54.066
Oh, hoo-hoo.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.806
Pretty sure we're in
the wrong movie again!

24:03.342 --> 24:04.911
( foghorn blares )

24:04.911 --> 24:06.212
( grunts )

24:06.212 --> 24:08.280
For the last time,
Dr. Erving,

24:08.280 --> 24:11.951
what's your interest
in ruby necklaces?

24:11.951 --> 24:15.421
( grunts ) Okay!
I think this plot point's
been achieved.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.989
Let's move on.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.858
Listen to this guy.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.760
Cool customer.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.163
Dr. Julius Erving,
"The Iceman."

24:24.163 --> 24:26.499
Technically, George Gervin
was "The Iceman."

24:26.499 --> 24:28.635
How about I tell you
what you're not telling me?

24:28.635 --> 24:31.337
Madeline Kincaid sent you
along with your--

24:31.337 --> 24:33.105
Hey, where's the dame?

24:33.105 --> 24:35.675
She must have slipped out.
She won't get far.

24:35.675 --> 24:39.612
Tell Madeline Kincaid
there's nothing left for her
on this ship no more.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.914
She made damn sure of that
when she left.

24:41.914 --> 24:45.785
Surprised?
Madeline didn't share
the full story with you.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.721
Par for the course
with a dame like that.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.591
Give her my love
when you see her.

24:51.591 --> 24:54.293
Oh, yeah, give her this
for me, too.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.394
( grunts )

24:55.394 --> 24:57.530
Okay, Chico,
over the side.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.398
Water will wake him up,
then find the dame.

24:59.398 --> 25:01.601
Right, Shaz.

25:10.509 --> 25:14.046
( sobbing )

25:19.118 --> 25:20.119
( door opens )

25:45.177 --> 25:47.513
( apes gibbering )

25:47.513 --> 25:49.916
Why am I still in
the cowboy outfit?

25:49.916 --> 25:52.118
At least you're not the one
wearing lipstick.

25:54.787 --> 25:58.725
Commander Reed Steele,
we meet again.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.794
I was not fooled
by your disguise.

26:01.794 --> 26:05.598
Dr. Alexandra Westbrook,
lovely as ever.

26:05.598 --> 26:10.402
Young Jub Jub.
My, how you've grown.

26:10.402 --> 26:14.206
Almost a man.

26:14.206 --> 26:17.877
Commander, did you
really think that your puny
Xenonian Stinger fleet

26:17.877 --> 26:20.512
could defeat
a Blandorian warship,

26:20.512 --> 26:23.249
let alone one commanded
by me, Dradok,

26:23.249 --> 26:25.417
High Priest of Blandoor?

26:25.417 --> 26:28.154
- Jub Jub?
- I got this.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.623
Dradok, you fool!

26:30.623 --> 26:32.992
The stinger squadron
was only a decoy.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.828
When the Alliance learned
you were commanding this ship,

26:35.828 --> 26:38.631
all Xenonian battle cruisers
were deployed,

26:38.631 --> 26:39.966
and at warp speed.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.601
But to Blandoor!

26:42.601 --> 26:44.470
What the hell are you doing?

26:44.470 --> 26:48.540
It's "Brain Robbers
From Planet Alpha Xenon Six."
A classic.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.609
- You lie!
- Do I?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.612
The why don't you try
reaching Blandoor
on the Telespectravision?

26:53.612 --> 26:56.382
Or do you fear
I speak the truth?

26:56.382 --> 26:58.384
Open a channel!

27:00.419 --> 27:02.454
( grunts )

27:02.454 --> 27:06.158
Ha! Ha! Ha!

27:06.158 --> 27:08.160
Congratulations, Dradok!

27:08.160 --> 27:10.496
You're the last remaining
High Priest.

27:10.496 --> 27:15.601
If only there were
a planet to return to,
you would be king.

27:15.601 --> 27:18.037
You forget one thing,
doctor.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.372
You are not guests
on this ship.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.174
You are prisoners.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.111
And though I may be
the last Blandorian,

27:25.111 --> 27:28.214
I will exact a revenge
so complete

27:28.214 --> 27:31.517
that every vanquished
Blandorian in the Ethranox

27:31.517 --> 27:35.487
will feel justly
and sweetly avenged!

27:35.487 --> 27:37.556
Take them to
the Cranial Cleansing Bloc!

27:37.556 --> 27:39.358
Ah, I forgot that part.

27:42.361 --> 27:45.932
Sorry, guys.
I tried.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.805
Who is this woman
in all these early photos?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.441
Oh, I don't know her name.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.778
She's probably a secretary
or a girlfriend. Or both.

27:58.778 --> 28:02.048
She's in all
the Doyle/Dupree stills.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.884
Something familiar
about her.

28:04.884 --> 28:08.755
Oh, hey, what about this?

28:08.755 --> 28:13.159
The hand from
"Seduce the Wind."

28:13.159 --> 28:15.795
The one that
Lon Harrington used...

28:15.795 --> 28:17.496
- On Vivian Nance.
- ( gasps )

28:17.496 --> 28:20.900
- Same one.
- ( soft beeping )

28:20.900 --> 28:23.502
Very, very unique item.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.572
But... not what
we're looking for.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.474
Okay, well, what exactly
are we looking for?

28:28.474 --> 28:33.012
Something that specifically
pertains to the films
in question

28:33.012 --> 28:36.215
or an item that has
commonality between them.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.317
I wish his stuff
were more organized.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.852
You must have loved
your father very much

28:39.852 --> 28:41.187
to honor his work this way.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.890
He was a difficult man
to love.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.825
But I was grateful to him.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.394
He and my mom adopted me
when I was a baby.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.430
- Your mother?
- They divorced
when I was four.

28:51.430 --> 28:56.102
My mom died when I was eight.
I was mostly raised
by boarding schools.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.537
And I missed him.
But you know what's funny?

28:58.537 --> 29:01.073
I always felt
closer to the films

29:01.073 --> 29:03.275
where the best of him is.

29:05.144 --> 29:08.214
I got it. I got it!
His typewriter.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.116
He wrote all
his scripts on it.

29:20.392 --> 29:23.996
- Nicely handled.
- Thanks for the warning.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.265
- Nice place you have here.
- This is your place.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.936
- Where do you live?
- I got a penthouse uptown
overlooking the park.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.971
That must be nicer.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.006
Okay, ah!
What happens next?

29:34.006 --> 29:37.543
Why don't you step over here
and find out?

29:37.543 --> 29:39.078
( thunder )

29:39.078 --> 29:42.281
( sultry music playing )

29:46.718 --> 29:49.788
I see we've arrived
at the love scene.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.758
I'd say you've earned it.

29:52.758 --> 29:55.127
You know, Eve,
you missed your era.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.595
In these clothes,
in this light,

29:56.595 --> 29:57.796
you're the cat's pajamas.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.565
I have to confess,
I've had this fantasy.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.101
- Have you really?
- Mm-hmm.

30:02.101 --> 30:06.438
The only trouble is...
the fade out.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.179
( beeping )

30:13.179 --> 30:14.813
- Both: Bingo.
- ( chuckles )

30:14.813 --> 30:17.549
Yes, the typewriter
is the artifact.

30:17.549 --> 30:21.187
Now, "The Found, the Lost,
and the Looking," the script.

30:21.187 --> 30:23.122
"The Found, the Lost,
and the Looking," okay.

30:23.122 --> 30:27.226
The scripts are over here.
I know they're kept over here.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.629
"The Found"--
"The Found, the Lost,
and the Looking."

30:30.629 --> 30:32.131
( chuckles )
I got it.

30:32.131 --> 30:36.468
- The original script. Wow.
- Excellent.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.671
Now, all right, so...

30:39.671 --> 30:41.673
- Who's "E. Darnell"?
- I don't know.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.310
Really? 'Cause it says
"The Found, the Lost,
and the Looking,"

30:44.310 --> 30:45.945
by E. Darnell.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.048
No, that can't be right.
My dad wrote all his scripts.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.317
Very interesting.

30:53.019 --> 30:56.722
So, Dr. Erving,
or is it Mr. Doyle?

30:56.722 --> 30:58.624
Back for round two?

30:58.624 --> 31:00.126
Boys, take Pearl below.

31:00.126 --> 31:01.360
She don't like the sight
of blood.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.462
But before you go,

31:03.462 --> 31:05.097
don't worry, sweetheart,

31:05.097 --> 31:06.798
Daddy'll give it back.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.134
You'll never get away
with this.

31:08.134 --> 31:10.702
Oh, no?
Two thieves break
into my office

31:10.702 --> 31:12.204
to steal a rare
ruby necklace,

31:12.204 --> 31:13.539
both get shot trying
to flee the scene.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.207
Who'll say different?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.875
Looks like your boys
might have missed

31:16.875 --> 31:18.244
this little fellow, Shaz,
when they frisked me.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.678
Hands up!

31:19.678 --> 31:22.048
- Ahh!
- Sorry, Mr. Doyle.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.382
- Me, too.
- Madeline.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.085
Yes, Tony, me.
How does it feel?

31:26.085 --> 31:28.087
You don't scare me.
You're pathetic.

31:28.087 --> 31:31.123
- Go ahead and shoot.
- Don't do it, Madeline.
You can still walk away.

31:31.123 --> 31:34.260
It's too late.
I can't come back. I won't.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.695
You're all bluff.
Take away your daddy's money
and what are you?

31:36.695 --> 31:39.265
A so-so singer
with too much past
and too little future.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.699
- Shut up.
- No husband.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.201
- I mean it, shut up!
- No talent.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.970
- Don't say it.
- And no kid.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.805
- ( groans )
- Flynn!

31:46.805 --> 31:48.540
( gunshot )

31:48.540 --> 31:50.542
( groans )

31:53.545 --> 31:55.081
Ahem.

32:10.196 --> 32:11.964
We're still in the movie.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.865
- What happened?
- I don't understand.

32:13.865 --> 32:17.036
- Our calculations
must have been off.
- We did everything right.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.771
It should have worked.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.374
We're trapped.

32:22.374 --> 32:26.078
Right back
where we started.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.155
( phone ringing )

32:36.155 --> 32:37.689
Doyle Investigations,
Kitty speaking.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.425
- How may I direct your call?
- Jenkins: Colonel?

32:39.425 --> 32:41.260
- Jenkins!
- Colonel Baird,
can you hear me?

32:41.260 --> 32:43.962
Yes, yes. Jenkins, help.
We're stuck in a loop.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.797
What did we of wrong
at the end?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.233
No, no,
you did everything right.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.268
- It's the wrong end.
- What does that mean?

32:49.268 --> 32:50.636
Jenkins:
James Desmond Wheeler

32:50.636 --> 32:51.670
didn't write the movie.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.139
He rewrote the ending.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.541
I've got the original
script in my hand,

32:55.541 --> 32:57.909
but the last four pages
are torn out.

32:57.909 --> 33:00.412
Yes. And I have
the shooting script,

33:00.412 --> 33:02.481
which is the identical
ending of your movie.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.916
You're saying
that the original
ended differently

33:04.916 --> 33:06.085
and we need to deduce how.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.220
- Precisely.
- How?

33:08.220 --> 33:09.955
We just spent this
whole movie as detectives

33:09.955 --> 33:11.423
and didn't deduce anything.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.225
I'd suggest you stop
being detectives

33:13.225 --> 33:14.693
and start being Librarians.

33:16.528 --> 33:17.763
( chuckles )

33:18.964 --> 33:20.666
All right, now...

33:20.666 --> 33:23.269
Let's see if we can take care
of the other Librarians.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.337
The magic typewriter
got us into this mess.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.506
It should also get us
out of it.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.974
Madeline Kincaid and Tony
first fell in love...

33:28.974 --> 33:30.476
When she started singing
at the club.

33:30.476 --> 33:31.810
It was her daddy's money
that bankrolled

33:31.810 --> 33:33.079
the construction
of The S.S. Tango.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.680
But then business
started booming

33:34.680 --> 33:36.715
and Madeline went from being
indispensable to disposable.

33:36.715 --> 33:39.185
- And hell hath no fury...
- Like a woman scorned.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.519
What are we missing?
What are we missing?

33:40.519 --> 33:43.389
Wait. How do we know
she wants her necklace back?

33:43.389 --> 33:45.924
She doesn't want that.
That's the ruse she used
to get us to play patsy.

33:45.924 --> 33:48.994
You mentioned that, she didn't.
She said someone connected
to the gaming industry

33:48.994 --> 33:51.197
had something of hers,
but she didn't specify.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.399
Question one,
why did I assume that's
what she wanted?

33:53.399 --> 33:55.601
Question two,
what does she really want?

33:55.601 --> 33:56.702
Let's ask her.

33:56.702 --> 34:00.672
( audio fast-forwarding )

34:00.672 --> 34:02.874
- Sorry, did that hurt?
- Hurt, baby?
I'm not even ticklish.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.078
( fast-forwarding )

34:08.547 --> 34:11.150
Here's to the found,
the lost, and the looking.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.785
- ( knocking )
- Madeline: Hello?
Is anyone in?

34:13.785 --> 34:15.020
( fast-forwarding )

34:15.020 --> 34:17.223
Come in.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.827
Mr. Doyle?
Mr. Mac Doyle?

34:21.827 --> 34:24.496
That's what my mama called me.
Take a seat, Miss Kincaid.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.466
You know my lover
and associate
Kitty Dupree.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.401
Uh, no.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.036
How do you do?

34:31.036 --> 34:32.538
Mr. Doyle,
I'm here to discu--

34:32.538 --> 34:34.840
Oh, I know all about
your problem.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.675
You want me to play
the dual role

34:36.675 --> 34:38.944
of "Patsy Punching-Bag"
and "Johnny Swiss-Cheese"

34:38.944 --> 34:41.380
in a bus-and-truck production
of "I Musta Been Stupid."

34:41.380 --> 34:43.382
Well, sister, I caught wise
when I caught wind

34:43.382 --> 34:44.816
the second you wafted in here.

34:44.816 --> 34:48.554
Oh, I'm afraid
I don't understand.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.322
You're not alone.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.191
You want to be
a little less poetic, Mac?

34:52.191 --> 34:54.793
Tony The Shaz took
something from you.
What was it?

34:54.793 --> 34:57.196
I, uh, we--

34:57.196 --> 34:58.564
Oh, we know you were together.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.400
We know your daddy's money
financed an empire.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.602
But then things got different
and you wanted out.

35:03.602 --> 35:07.939
And you took
his pound of flesh as payment
for a broken heart.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.242
You're not just good,
Mr. Doyle.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.378
You're clairvoyant.

35:12.378 --> 35:14.813
You got all that
just from my scent?

35:14.813 --> 35:20.219
Imagine what insight
you might glean from my touch.
I keep a bungalow--

35:20.219 --> 35:24.756
Enough with the bungalow,
Madeline. Not gonna happen.
What does Tony have?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.958
I never should have left him.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.527
Then everything would
have been okay.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.362
He wasn't all bad,
not always.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.130
But he took something
from you, didn't he?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.899
- Yes.
- To punish you for leaving.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.402
- Yes.
- To hurt you in a way
that only you could be hurt.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.937
- Yes.
- But it wasn't a career
that he took from you.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.506
- No.
- Or your youth.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.974
But he took
something, Madeline,
something irreplaceable.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.844
- Mm-hmm, yes.
- And it wasn't your rubies,
was it, Madeline?

35:45.844 --> 35:48.146
Tell me, what was it?
It was...

35:48.146 --> 35:51.016
My Pearl.

35:51.016 --> 35:52.551
Madeline and Tony
had a daughter,

35:52.551 --> 35:54.253
but they kept it hush-hush
to avoid scandal,

35:54.253 --> 35:55.987
and when Madeline left,
Tony took her.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.356
That's who I saw below deck.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.957
I wasn't there to find
the necklace,

35:58.957 --> 36:00.058
I was there to see the girl.

36:00.058 --> 36:01.260
Wheeler changed
the whole movie

36:01.260 --> 36:02.594
by rewriting
the last four pages.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.895
He changed the heroine
to a femme fatale,

36:03.895 --> 36:04.896
the villain to a victim.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.765
And the pearl to a ruby.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.437
( grunting )

36:11.437 --> 36:12.638
For the last time,
Dr. Erving,

36:12.638 --> 36:14.139
what's your interest
in ruby necklaces?

36:14.139 --> 36:16.041
Gift for your mom.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.843
( grunts )

36:31.657 --> 36:34.760
So, Dr. J,
or is it Mr. Doyle?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.228
Back for round two?

36:36.228 --> 36:37.496
Boys, take Pearl below.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.730
She don't like the sight
of blood.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.832
But before you go,

36:40.832 --> 36:42.801
don't worry, sweetheart,

36:42.801 --> 36:44.069
Daddy'll give it back.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.371
You'll never get away
with this.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.039
Oh, no? Two thieves break
into my office,

36:48.039 --> 36:49.575
to steal a rare
ruby necklace,

36:49.575 --> 36:50.909
both get shot
trying to flee the scene.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.478
Who'll say different?

36:52.478 --> 36:53.945
Looks like your boys
might have missed

36:53.945 --> 36:55.781
this little fellow, Shaz,
when they frisked me.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.483
- Hands up!
- Tony?

37:03.088 --> 37:06.157
- Madeline?
- Yes, Tony, it's me.

37:06.157 --> 37:10.195
- I've come to apologize.
- Tony: What?

37:10.195 --> 37:11.463
You don't scare me.
Go ahead and shoot.

37:11.463 --> 37:14.065
I know I hurt you,
Tony, but please,

37:14.065 --> 37:16.001
don't punish Pearl
for something I did.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.836
That's a lie.
You're all bluff.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.771
Take away your daddy's money
and what are you?

37:19.771 --> 37:22.374
A so-so singer
with too much past
and too little future.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.175
I don't care about
my future, Tony.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.544
- Only Pearl's future.
- Shut up!

37:25.544 --> 37:27.245
- I'm sorry, Tony.
- I said shut up!

37:27.245 --> 37:30.048
I loved you once,
and you loved me.

37:30.048 --> 37:33.785
If you love her,
let her go.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.527
Never!
This story ends one way only.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.828
- Drop it, Doyle!
- Ah!

37:42.828 --> 37:43.829
Boys!

37:53.572 --> 37:54.940
All right, boys,
you know what to do.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.876
Fit 'em with cement shoes
and make 'em fish food.

37:57.876 --> 37:58.877
Oh!

38:07.586 --> 38:08.654
Watch out!

38:08.654 --> 38:10.756
Tex Mangrove...

38:12.724 --> 38:14.360
was...

38:17.095 --> 38:18.129
was...

38:18.129 --> 38:19.631
his...

38:21.700 --> 38:24.269
* Name

38:24.269 --> 38:25.471
Cassandra,
keep 'em covered

38:25.471 --> 38:27.038
while Stone
and Ezekiel tie 'em up.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.440
Then call LAPD Harbor Patrol

38:28.440 --> 38:30.008
and tell 'em to get
Tony The Shaz on a 207.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.243
Kitty, what do you say
we take Madeline downstairs

38:32.243 --> 38:34.413
and show her
what she came for?

38:50.028 --> 38:52.030
( both sobbing )

39:03.575 --> 39:04.943
Why?

39:04.943 --> 39:07.779
Why go back and change
what he'd written?

39:07.779 --> 39:10.148
He didn't.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.083
He changed
what I'd written.

39:12.083 --> 39:15.421
Uh, sorry, Eleanor.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.855
I don't understand.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.925
Wait. Eleanor...

39:22.093 --> 39:23.562
Are you E. Darnell?

39:23.562 --> 39:25.631
I am.

39:27.466 --> 39:30.569
I met your father
when I was 19.

39:32.303 --> 39:35.073
Oh, it was wonderful.

39:35.073 --> 39:38.043
A true collaboration.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.512
I didn't care
about the credit.

39:40.512 --> 39:44.249
But then he took you, too.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.784
You're my mother?

39:45.784 --> 39:49.555
I am your mother.

39:52.558 --> 39:56.562
And I have never
stopped loving you.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.899
I love you.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.451
( noir music playing )

40:26.792 --> 40:31.196
So James Desmond Wheeler
did not write the five
Doyle/Dupree movies.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.564
Nope.
They were written entirely

40:32.564 --> 40:34.600
by his young assistant
Eleanor Darnell.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.067
The had an affair,
she got pregnant...

40:36.067 --> 40:38.904
And to avoid scandal,
Wheeler convinced Eleanor

40:38.904 --> 40:41.006
to let him and his wife
raise Jade as their own.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.808
He gave her some money,
sent her off.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.409
And then she wrote "The Found,
the Lost, and the Looking"

40:44.409 --> 40:46.044
and sent it to Wheeler
and prayed that he'd make it

40:46.044 --> 40:47.579
in the hopes that
the real story underneath

40:47.579 --> 40:48.580
would one day come to light.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.381
It did. Just took a jolt

40:50.381 --> 40:52.450
from a super-charged ley line
to make that prayer come true.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.985
And me getting shot twice
and beaten.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.421
Not to mention some
very keen detective work.

40:56.421 --> 40:58.056
Thank you, Jenkins.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.694
Fun date.

41:02.694 --> 41:05.363
What do you say next time
we stay home and watch Hulu?

41:05.363 --> 41:07.666
I have to say,
shootings and beatings aside,

41:07.666 --> 41:10.101
this may have been
my favorite date ever.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.103
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:12.103 --> 41:16.608
I got to go into a world
that I've fantasized about
since I was nine.

41:16.608 --> 41:19.444
I got to see a very
different side of you--

41:19.444 --> 41:21.880
dashing, sexy, confident.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.582
How was that
a different side?

41:23.582 --> 41:25.784
Well, I mean, he's--
he's-- you're--

41:25.784 --> 41:28.687
you are--
not that you're not, but Mac?

41:28.687 --> 41:31.356
Mac's just so, uh,
you know.

41:31.356 --> 41:33.091
He's-- and you try--

41:33.091 --> 41:36.494
( sultry music playing )

41:42.167 --> 41:46.271
( theme music playing )
