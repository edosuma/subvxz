01:36.054 --> 01:39.354
The mind holds onto painful
memories for a reason...

01:39.433 --> 01:43.154
trying to keep us from making the
same mistakes over and over.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.856
Some say if you go back to where
a painful memory started...

01:45.939 --> 01:51.196
look at the place, walk through it,
you can get free of the hurt and forget.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.407
Maybe I thought that would happen.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.792
I'll tell you though, it would
have been all right with me...

01:57.868 --> 02:00.337
if I never saw this town again.

02:00.412 --> 02:05.589
But it was the only teaching job I could
get, and I needed it, and I took it.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.505
Oh, Jim, it's lovely.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.057
Pretty good, huh?

02:13.592 --> 02:15.265
- Looks boring.
- No.

02:15.344 --> 02:19.724
Oh, come on, you're gonna love it.
It's much better than Chicago.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.772
Of course, things had changed...

02:22.851 --> 02:25.775
but not much, considering
the years that had passed.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.949
No, not nearly enough to keep
my heart from tightening...

02:29.024 --> 02:33.154
to keep me from forgetting that this was
the town where my brother had died.

02:33.236 --> 02:37.366
The same town my parents fled in
fear and grief when I was nine.

02:37.449 --> 02:41.249
The same. Only the
faces had changed.

02:47.042 --> 02:51.172
Sixteen forty-seven, that's
what it said? Are you sure?

02:51.254 --> 02:54.929
- Sixteen forty-seven Harland.
- Okay.

03:02.099 --> 03:06.275
- Hey, where are all the sidewalks?
- That's the least of our problems.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.834
Well, we don't have to stay.
I'll go back to house painting.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.433
I can start with this
shack right here.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.297
No way. You are not a
house painter anymore.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.299
Well, I might not be much of
a teacher either, you know.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.887
Might be a little rusty
after this layoff.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.830
You'll be fine. It's
just like riding a bike.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.638
- You never give up on me, do you?
- Nope. Never.

03:43.473 --> 03:47.979
Okay, two guys with a truck, come on.
Let's unload this van.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.615
Scott could tell that
Sally and I were afraid.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.739
How many years had I worked and
what did we have to show for it?

03:54.818 --> 03:57.662
I wanted to provide for
him, not put him in danger.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.786
- Good night, pumpkin.
- Good night, Mom.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.959
- Sleep well.
- Okay.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.667
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, Dad.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.464
Good night.

04:08.331 --> 04:12.962
- What do you think, on or off?
- Off.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.138
- Sure?
- Yeah.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.346
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:26.558 --> 04:30.188
I have a certain way of
breaking in a new house.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.245
I have to establish my territory.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.795
If I had known the
horror we were facing...

04:46.870 --> 04:50.795
I would have taken Sally and Scott in
my arms like my parents took me...

04:50.874 --> 04:53.753
and run from this town forever.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.813
I hear this new teacher threw
some kid out a window in Chicago.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.938
- No, man, he ran him over with his car.
- No, no, that's not what happened.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.395
The guy got fired because
he went berserk in class.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.606
He picked up a chair and threw...

05:23.615 --> 05:26.164
My fifth class today.

05:26.243 --> 05:30.464
I'm a little out of shape.
Thank God you're seniors.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.416
You'll have mercy on me, I hope.

05:37.504 --> 05:41.304
- So I'll do my best to keep you awake.
- We'd rather sleep.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.436
Well, I can tell this is
not love at first sight...

05:48.515 --> 05:51.940
but you got to live with me and
I got to live with you, so...

05:52.018 --> 05:54.567
let's try to enjoy it, okay?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.614
May I?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.159
There's something you should
know about this class.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.832
- Do you have a name?
- Yeah.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.210
- Do you wanna tell it to me?
- Chip Conway.

06:09.286 --> 06:13.211
Or the Chipster depending
on how close you get.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.674
Now, you see, Mr. Jim, sir,
there's a little...

06:17.752 --> 06:20.676
Hold it. It's Mr. Norman
or just Jim.

06:20.755 --> 06:24.976
Yeah, that's what I said.
This isn't a real class.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.349
You see, most of us in here
are on the football team.

06:27.429 --> 06:32.686
It's a special class for jocks
like me and airhead chicks.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.612
Like Kate.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.742
- I'm not an airhead.
- Yeah, right!

06:40.817 --> 06:44.913
Now, let us cruise and we'll
win you a championship.

06:44.988 --> 06:49.209
Pass us and you'll have one
happy squad of killer stompers.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.412
Yeah! Yeah!

06:51.494 --> 06:54.919
You'll pass, if you do the work.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.296
Pass us anyway.

07:05.425 --> 07:09.350
All right, let's just keep it down.
Hold it down. Hey!

07:10.347 --> 07:11.849
Hey!

07:12.807 --> 07:14.434
Shut up!

07:18.229 --> 07:22.234
- Sorry.
- No, really, don't be sorry.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.743
I want to apologize for
the jerks in this class.

07:26.821 --> 07:31.452
- Some of us really wanna learn stuff.
- Thank you... Kate? Thank you.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.838
But I do wanna apologize.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.179
I'm just... I'm a little rusty
at this teaching, and...

07:43.964 --> 07:48.344
- I won't be breaking any more sticks.
- I kind of liked it.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.145
I don't know, Mr. Simmons. This guy's
coming down really hard on us.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.898
- We've got a big responsibility...
- Just a moment.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.696
- Mr. Norman.
- Hello, sir.

07:59.771 --> 08:03.992
- So, how was your first day?
- Well, it was fine, sir. Just fine.

08:04.067 --> 08:08.413
Good. If you have a minute,
I'd like to have a quick chat.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.116
- Sure.
- In my office.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.455
Excuse me.

08:24.087 --> 08:29.014
In 27 years, no one had moved
in after my parents and I left.

08:29.092 --> 08:32.892
What was it about this house
that kept them away?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.528
I'm gonna get you, Jimmy.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.959
Got you now.

08:58.455 --> 09:03.837
No, Wayne. Wayne...
Stop, Wayne! Wayne!

09:06.671 --> 09:09.891
Wayne, no. No, Wayne. Wayne, no.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.595
Wayne!

09:14.554 --> 09:16.773
Run, Jimmy, run!

09:26.024 --> 09:28.447
Sally? Scott?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.831
Surprise!

09:33.281 --> 09:35.955
- Hey, it's enough.
- Look!

09:36.576 --> 09:40.672
- Where did you get this?
- You are married to a very clever woman.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.968
You know, this place really has
potential in a bohemian sort of way.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.889
- We went to the thrift store.
- Don't tell him that, Scott.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.842
I spent a tiny bit of Christmas
money, but it's nice, isn't it?

09:51.925 --> 09:55.475
- It's great.
- And, look, I got this. It's an antique.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.022
Wait a minute,
I'll show you the rest.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.146
I saw the perfect place
downtown today.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.648
Honey, this isn't Chicago.
There is no downtown here.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.446
Well, you know what I mean,
over there in the center of town.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.945
It's a vacant store front.
It's perfect for the shop.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.116
Sounds great.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.695
And I've decided, I'm not
gonna do just flowers.

10:11.778 --> 10:16.124
You know, I think in a place like
this, you can't be so specific.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.749
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm all right.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.465
I'm really excited about this place.
I think it's a perfect location.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.042
Can I have my train back?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.002
Yep. Why don't you go get the
mitts and we'll play some ball?

10:27.085 --> 10:29.383
- So how was work?
- It was all right.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.137
The principal called me
into his office today.

10:33.216 --> 10:36.095
Said he didn't want a
Chicago incident here...

10:36.177 --> 10:37.895
that I should watch my anger.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.565
I thought you cleared that
up at the first interview.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.019
Well, I think he just wants
me to know he's watching.

10:44.102 --> 10:49.700
And the students seem to know, too.
I hope the stories don't get out of hand.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.277
Come on, Dad!

10:52.360 --> 10:54.158
Coming! We won't be long.

10:54.237 --> 10:58.367
Yeah, well, don't be long.
Dinner's almost ready.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.130
Sally?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.674
Sally?

13:04.158 --> 13:08.129
You gonna be here for a minute?
You go... Wait a minute.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.883
We're ready.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.671
Yes. Yes.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.390
Does he sing? No.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.765
Does he dance? No.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.688
Oh, honey, stop.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.574
You're awful.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.865
I don't know.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.625
No way.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.397
Jimmy?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.614
Hey.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.990
- Hey, what's eating you?
- Why can't I go to the library with you?

14:25.073 --> 14:26.950
- Who said you can't?
- Mom.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.879
Yeah? Well, I just talked to mom
and I worked everything out.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.297
If you wanna go, you can go,
but you got to carry my books.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.171
Okay-

14:39.962 --> 14:43.762
You and me, Jimmy, we're
always gonna stick together.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.688
I got to pay my library fine,
so I'm gonna need your help.

14:48.763 --> 14:52.438
How much is three
times two, times two?

14:52.517 --> 14:54.611
It's 12.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.110
You're the one who's got
the brains in this family.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.191
Here you go.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.625
Yay!

15:23.214 --> 15:29.267
- We're gonna go through the tunnel?
- Sure. It's faster. Come on.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.731
No!

15:38.020 --> 15:39.647
Wayne!

15:41.023 --> 15:44.903
Don't!

16:00.543 --> 16:03.922
Hey, buttface,
you're blocking the road.

16:06.757 --> 16:11.103
Sissies with books.
Read me a story, sissy.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.305
Do you wanna get through
this tunnel, kid?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.508
You're gonna have to pay.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.390
- We'll go back.
- "We'll go back."

16:53.471 --> 16:56.816
Nope. No other way except our way.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.360
Right, Vinnie?

17:00.937 --> 17:03.281
- So give us some money.
- Leave us alone.

17:03.356 --> 17:07.406
Hey, look, new sneakers.
Let's see if they can fly.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.050
Can they ﬂy?

17:33.803 --> 17:37.899
Now, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.561
- How much money you got?
- Twelve cents.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.271
Leave my brother alone!

17:45.356 --> 17:49.327
Vinnie, get this little baby
away from me before I smack him.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.789
Whoa!

18:00.496 --> 18:03.466
Nobody hits me and lives, man.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.467
- Hey, come on, guys.
- Wayne!

18:09.213 --> 18:11.215
Run, Jimmy, run!

18:11.882 --> 18:13.884
Heads up, Vinnie.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.861
Run, Jimmy, run!

18:31.193 --> 18:34.788
He deserved it, man.
You had that coming.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.289
- He had it coming!
- What about him?

18:38.367 --> 18:41.712
- What if he tells somebody?
- Come here, kid.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.832
Let's go! Let's go!

18:45.875 --> 18:49.004
- Let's go! Let's go! Hand me the keys!
- No! No!

18:49.962 --> 18:54.433
- Wayne!
- Get help. Get help. Run!

18:54.508 --> 18:56.681
- Where's the key?
- Find the key!

18:56.761 --> 18:59.856
- Okay, let's go!
- Hey, kid!

19:00.598 --> 19:01.941
Mueller!

19:02.016 --> 19:04.394
- You coward!
- Mueller!

19:26.832 --> 19:29.585
Jimmy, what's wrong?

19:38.052 --> 19:40.555
No! Wayne...

19:43.641 --> 19:45.314
Jim?

19:54.443 --> 19:55.990
Jim.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.580
Are you all right?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.753
Yeah.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.666
I thought I heard a child crying.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.090
It was... It was me.

20:17.174 --> 20:21.179
Why don't you come on inside?
I'll fix you a cup of coffee.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.106
Yeah.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.938
In a minute.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.159
Run, Jimmy, run!

21:17.860 --> 21:20.579
You told Coach I had an F coming?
He suspended me!

21:20.654 --> 21:22.622
Well, maybe the message will
get through to you, Chip!

21:22.698 --> 21:25.167
You get an F on your midterm,
the Coach is gonna cut you from the team.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.994
If you give me one more F,
I swear to God, I'm gonna...

21:27.077 --> 21:28.954
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

21:29.747 --> 21:33.718
Look, Chip, I played football, too,
and I did my school work.

21:33.793 --> 21:38.264
Now, you're a smart guy.
You wanna play, just do the work.

21:40.758 --> 21:43.352
You gonna take that, dude?

21:55.940 --> 21:57.942
You're dead, man!

21:58.025 --> 21:59.618
You.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.324
Come on. Come on.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.554
What were you and Chip talking about?
He looked pretty mad.

22:22.633 --> 22:26.137
Oh, no, no, we...
We were just talking.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.609
What is it?

22:38.023 --> 22:42.620
I don't know. Mr. Norman, Jim...

22:43.654 --> 22:47.375
You know how you're saying
that history repeats itself?

22:47.449 --> 22:52.250
I've been thinking a lot about that,
and that really bothers me.

22:52.329 --> 22:55.128
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.586
Does it have to be the same
story repeated over again?

22:58.669 --> 23:02.924
- I mean, can't we change anything?
- Well, people can change things.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.180
I think that's what makes
a person great is...

23:05.259 --> 23:09.184
guts and the ability to
change the patterns.

23:10.306 --> 23:14.812
I was listening to that "Dust
in the Wind" song last night.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.396
I don't know.

23:17.187 --> 23:21.442
I just don't wanna end up a piece
of dust in someone's eye, you know?

23:22.276 --> 23:24.620
Well, I don't think that's
all you'll be, Billy.

23:24.695 --> 23:27.869
'Cause, you're learning how to think.
That's a good sign.

23:37.499 --> 23:41.174
Hey, do I get extra
credit for thinking?

23:55.935 --> 23:59.405
Billy? Your wallet! Billy?

24:52.700 --> 24:54.702
What are you doing, man?

24:55.285 --> 24:56.081
Come on!

25:00.541 --> 25:01.588
Hey.

25:04.169 --> 25:04.840
Hey!

25:10.718 --> 25:12.311
Come on!

25:12.761 --> 25:14.308
Stop!

25:16.098 --> 25:18.396
What are you guys doing?

25:18.475 --> 25:21.024
Help me! Help me!

25:22.187 --> 25:23.985
Help me!

25:28.360 --> 25:31.330
Billy! Billy!

25:47.755 --> 25:49.348
Billy!

25:53.385 --> 25:55.479
Oh no... oh no...

26:06.648 --> 26:10.869
You have a new student, period seven,
name's Lawson, Richard Lawson.

26:10.944 --> 26:15.996
He's a transfer from Milford.
You have the room unfortunately.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.169
He can take Billy Stearns' seat.

26:18.243 --> 26:23.625
Mr. Simmons, Billy Stearns was murdered.
I saw it. That car ran him off the road.

26:26.335 --> 26:30.715
No one there saw any
other car but yours.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.641
Just yours.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.641
I don't know what to tell you.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.783
Okay, guys, let's sit down.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.457
Chip, take a seat.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.456
- What's that, an order?
- No, it's a suggestion.

26:59.535 --> 27:03.165
You could take a seat or you
can go talk to Coach about it.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.840
Okay-

27:04.915 --> 27:06.542
Let's sit down.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.837
Heather, I haven't forgotten
that report you owe me.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.797
Okay, all right.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.596
Are you Richard Lawson?

27:17.010 --> 27:19.433
Live and in person, Mr. Norman.

27:19.513 --> 27:23.484
Just came up from Milford.
Real glad to be here, sir.

27:31.525 --> 27:35.029
One thing you have to know,
in my class, no cigarettes.

27:36.405 --> 27:39.033
No problem, Mr. Norman.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.832
I wouldn't want to do
anything to upset you, sir.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.881
Take a seat.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.385
I can't wait for you to start
teaching me, Mr. Norman.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.682
I hunger for knowledge.

28:06.518 --> 28:11.194
I know we're all pretty upset
about Billy Stearns' death.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.119
So if...

28:16.445 --> 28:19.665
If any of you have anything you
wanna talk about or say...

28:19.740 --> 28:21.959
now's the time to do it.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.840
Mr. Lawson.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.302
Why do you keep staring
at me, Mr. Norman?

28:40.427 --> 28:41.895
I wasn't staring at
you, Mr. Lawson.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.189
Oh, yes, you were, Mr. Norman.
You were looking right at me.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.858
I was not staring at you!

28:46.934 --> 28:48.982
Well, maybe you are unaware of it, sir,
but my old man used to be...

28:49.061 --> 28:51.655
All right, look, that's enough!

28:51.730 --> 28:54.358
You wanna talk about this more,
we'll go down to the principal's office.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.785
- Okay?
- Hey, I'm cool.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.909
Don't let them upset you,
Mr. Norman.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.990
They're idiots.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.839
Thanks, Kate...

29:12.209 --> 29:15.964
Does anybody else have anything
they wanna say about Billy?

29:16.755 --> 29:19.554
If not, we'll go on with history.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.183
Last time, we were talking
about the Middle East.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.560
We were talking about Iraq.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.868
Now, whoever threw this...

29:39.194 --> 29:42.539
I want everybody here to know
I think you're nothing but a coward!

29:42.614 --> 29:43.706
You're a chicken!

29:43.782 --> 29:46.251
Why don't you throw something
at me while I'm looking, huh?

29:46.326 --> 29:50.957
Throw it to my face! Come on,
somebody throw it! Now!

29:54.459 --> 29:57.588
I'll take the class over for a while.
You take a break here.

29:57.671 --> 30:01.175
- It's okay.
- I said take a break, Mr. Norman.

30:53.477 --> 30:56.572
God is there to pay him his clues.

30:56.646 --> 31:00.651
- Wayne, why is he always looking at me?
- Who?

31:00.734 --> 31:02.486
Jesus.

31:02.569 --> 31:06.073
No matter where we sit,
he looks right at me.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.874
This place scares me.

31:07.949 --> 31:12.750
There's nothing to be afraid of, Jimmy.
This is the safest place I know.

31:19.044 --> 31:24.426
Yeah, what a lovely day for the
67th Annual Harvest Day Parade!

31:31.515 --> 31:37.022
You know, all this stuff about Billy's death
brought up a lot of feelings about Wayne.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.525
I'm just trying not
to let it get to me.

31:42.526 --> 31:46.656
I think you're doing great.
I'm proud of you.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.158
Thanks.

31:52.202 --> 31:55.251
Now where's Scotty? Wasn't
he supposed to meet us here?

31:55.330 --> 31:57.799
Hey, balloon for you.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.610
- There you are.
- Dad, look.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.909
- Where did you get those?
- They fell off that pole.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.157
I used to have shoes like
this when I was a kid.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.658
Can I keep them?

32:27.737 --> 32:30.081
I don't know. They probably
belong to someone.

32:30.157 --> 32:34.378
- What do you think?
- Yeah, they probably belong to somebody.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.751
But I found them.

32:43.170 --> 32:48.017
Dad, look, a video store! Can we
get a movie to watch tonight?

32:55.515 --> 32:59.110
I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'm falling asleep, all right?

32:59.853 --> 33:04.700
- Do you want me to carry him up to bed?
- I want you to carry me up to bed.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.112
Come on, Scotty.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.746
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be up in just a minute.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.457
I wanna see if he gets the girl.

33:46.733 --> 33:50.704
Run, Jimmy, run! Hurry. Go, go!
Run, run, all right!

33:50.779 --> 33:53.908
Go, go, go! Run! Run!

34:10.882 --> 34:12.634
Wayne...

34:34.822 --> 34:37.621
- Run, Jimmy, run!
- Wayne!

34:37.701 --> 34:39.920
Run, Jimmy, run!

35:26.124 --> 35:28.297
You and me, Jimmy, we're
always gonna stick together.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.502
How much is three...

35:29.586 --> 35:33.807
- We're always gonna stick together.
- Nobody hits me and lives, man!

35:35.425 --> 35:38.304
- Hey, kid!
- Run, Jimmy, run!

36:11.628 --> 36:14.882
Oh, Mr. Norman. What are
you doing down here?

36:14.964 --> 36:18.218
Well, I was just taking a little walk.
Maybe I ought to ask you the same thing.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.645
Oh, well, I was just
taking a walk, too.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.599
My mom has a friend over and
we don't really get along.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.730
- I was just on my way back.
- Well, I'll walk with you.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.813
Oh, no. No, that's really fine. I just
live above the cleaners over there.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.819
So... So, see you.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.072
Oh, Kate, you know that old train.

36:35.151 --> 36:38.325
- Does it still run through here?
- Train?

36:38.780 --> 36:42.034
Well, I've never seen a
train and I grew up here.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.620
I guess there used to be one.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.624
Well, be careful.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.052
It's not like I'm lost
in the woods or nothing.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.131
- I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Norman.
- Yeah.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.239
- Run, Jimmy, run!
- Jimmy!

37:18.111 --> 37:19.704
Don't run!

37:20.280 --> 37:22.203
Help me, Jimmy!

37:40.383 --> 37:41.976
No!

37:45.013 --> 37:48.813
- Are you all right?
- It's just a dream. Just a dream.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.361
Oh, God, it's just a dream.

38:00.236 --> 38:04.787
Promise me you'll come back to bed.
You haven't slept hardly at all lately.

38:04.866 --> 38:08.245
When I sleep, I dream!
I don't wanna dream!

38:09.078 --> 38:10.955
I'm sorry.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.215
It's starting again, isn't it?

38:16.294 --> 38:18.638
Dad, are you okay?

38:19.464 --> 38:21.432
Your father just had a nightmare.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.604
Come on, let's go back to bed.

38:48.535 --> 38:49.661
Stop it.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.256
Stop it.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.890
Come on, Scotty. They can't all be jerks.
You must like at least one of them.

39:08.972 --> 39:12.067
No, they're all mean.
I don't like them.

39:12.141 --> 39:14.860
- Me and all the other kids...
- Hey, that's enough sugar.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.938
- Daddy does it!
- Hey, hey, come on.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.149
Don't tell on your old man.

39:19.649 --> 39:23.699
- Where'd you go last night?
- Nowhere. Just walking around.

39:23.778 --> 39:27.282
- So you never went back to sleep?
- No.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.887
Maybe we should consider
not staying here.

39:40.962 --> 39:45.638
- What are you talking about?
- Jim, I'm not blind. I can't help it.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.391
I'm concerned about you.
I don't want...

39:50.722 --> 39:55.603
Things to start happening again. Maybe
we should just pack up and leave.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.312
We're going back home?

39:57.395 --> 40:00.945
We're not going anywhere.
Now eat your breakfast.

40:03.026 --> 40:05.950
- Do I have anything to say about anything?
- Oh, yeah.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.248
I just want us to be happy.

40:08.323 --> 40:12.044
Coming here was gonna be a new
beginning, not another...

40:13.119 --> 40:15.167
Not another what?

40:17.916 --> 40:21.045
Great! Great!
I got to get to school.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.547
Help me, please, somebody!

41:03.336 --> 41:05.964
Help me, please, somebody!

41:11.678 --> 41:14.807
Remain in your seats after
you finish your tests.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.952
Okay, I'm giving this
Norman guy another 15...

41:28.027 --> 41:31.873
but I think he's got us
on a wild goose chase.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.700
Anything?

41:34.784 --> 41:36.957
Okay, I'm calling it.

41:37.954 --> 41:42.551
Okay, boys, let's bring it back in.
Everybody check in now. Come on!

41:43.292 --> 41:45.715
Come on, Mr. Norman,
we're gonna break for dinner.

41:45.795 --> 41:49.299
- We'll get back at it later.
- Wait a minute.

41:49.382 --> 41:53.603
- Is there a barn around here someplace?
- Well, yeah.

41:53.678 --> 41:57.148
The old Phelps place is over
there across that creek.

43:03.873 --> 43:06.547
These incidents tend to cluster.

43:06.626 --> 43:11.097
One suicide triggers destructive
behavior in other troubled young people.

43:11.172 --> 43:15.018
I can tell you, it will be the
simple things you do that count.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.141
Trust your instincts.

43:17.220 --> 43:21.691
If someone seems like they're
in trouble, they probably are.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.519
Reach out. Connect with them.

43:25.812 --> 43:29.316
Refer all problems to Dr. Bernardi.

43:29.398 --> 43:32.743
Otherwise, keep everything
smooth and normal.

43:32.819 --> 43:35.493
Come on, we have two
dead children here.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.573
Things aren't smooth
or normal, are they?

43:37.657 --> 43:41.287
And Kate's death wasn't suicide.
She was murdered.

43:41.369 --> 43:42.916
Oh, God...

43:59.470 --> 44:01.222
Mr. Norman? Mr. Norman?

44:02.807 --> 44:05.777
What makes you think Kate's
death wasn't a suicide?

44:05.852 --> 44:07.195
I just know.

44:07.270 --> 44:10.240
I know both these kids were in
our class. Were you close?

44:10.314 --> 44:14.069
Yes, I liked them both, and
neither one of them was suicidal.

44:14.152 --> 44:17.076
It's a matter of record you've had
some emotional problems in the past.

44:17.155 --> 44:20.455
I was just wondering,
how you're handling this.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.461
What are you getting at?

44:23.536 --> 44:26.665
I counsel faculty as
well as students.

44:26.747 --> 44:29.842
If you'd like to meet in
a confidential setting...

44:30.585 --> 44:32.963
What if it's bizarre?

44:33.045 --> 44:34.763
Bizarre in what way?

44:37.300 --> 44:40.053
I have a class to get to.
Excuse me.

44:50.646 --> 44:53.240
Who are you? You don't
belong in this class.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.159
I do now.

44:56.402 --> 44:59.030
I'm a transfer from Milford.

45:02.533 --> 45:07.130
You don't mind if I sit in
this empty desk, do you?

45:07.205 --> 45:09.799
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Kate's old seat.

45:10.750 --> 45:12.878
He doesn't know that.

45:14.503 --> 45:16.676
Or maybe he does.

45:17.423 --> 45:21.894
You got a problem with that, Jimmy?
I mean, Mr. Norman.

45:25.765 --> 45:29.690
- Do you wanna give that to me?
- I'd love to give it to you.

46:54.687 --> 46:57.406
- Jim?
- Yeah, almost through.

46:57.481 --> 47:01.827
There's a boy at the door.
He says he's one of your students.

47:07.408 --> 47:09.706
Did you keep the door locked?

47:09.785 --> 47:13.790
- Yes.
- Okay. I'll handle this.

47:18.836 --> 47:19.758
Who's here?

47:19.837 --> 47:22.590
You get back to your room.
Go on, now!

47:40.816 --> 47:42.693
What's going on, Chip?
What are you doing here?

47:42.777 --> 47:45.530
Listen, I'm not here to
give you a bad time, okay?

47:45.613 --> 47:48.457
There's something
I have to tell you.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.126
Okay-

48:00.378 --> 48:03.507
- What is it?
- If they do anything...

48:04.757 --> 48:07.636
you got to know that
I wasn't in on it.

48:08.219 --> 48:12.725
I mean, those guys... Mr. Norman,
those guys are seriously crazy.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.809
Lawson and Vincent?

48:16.727 --> 48:20.322
I went out with them
tonight, had a few beers.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.526
You know, and I started talking
about how you were ﬂunking me...

48:22.608 --> 48:24.610
and how I was gonna get
you and everything?

48:24.693 --> 48:26.661
What happened?

48:28.239 --> 48:30.458
They took me right up on it.

48:30.533 --> 48:34.754
They said they knew you a long time
ago and they were gonna get even.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.876
They hate you, Mr. Norman.

48:39.959 --> 48:44.760
Chip, do you think they
killed Billy and Kate?

48:50.636 --> 48:52.309
DO you?

48:54.098 --> 48:56.226
Then you have to say so.
You have to tell the police.

48:56.308 --> 48:58.060
No, if they find out I've been
talking to you, they'll...

48:58.144 --> 49:00.112
- They won't know anything.
- Don't you see?

49:00.187 --> 49:03.147
I'm not going back to school tomorrow.
I've got a brother in Kansas City...

49:03.149 --> 49:07.154
- We got to go stop these guys!
- I've got to go, it's not my fight!

49:09.196 --> 49:11.415
I'm just a jock.

49:13.451 --> 49:15.249
- I'm sorry.
- Chip!

49:16.370 --> 49:17.997
Wait!

49:19.915 --> 49:22.839
We can't keep running from them!

49:41.228 --> 49:42.775
Chip!

49:44.857 --> 49:46.404
Chip!

49:51.030 --> 49:54.375
- Jim, what's going on?
- Get back in the house!

50:06.420 --> 50:08.468
- Lock all the doors and get upstairs.
- What the hell is going on?

50:08.547 --> 50:11.676
- I don't want you two to get hurt!
- You're scaring Scotty!

50:14.803 --> 50:17.556
- Oh, for God's sake!
- No!

50:19.308 --> 50:22.027
Hello, Mrs. Norman.
I'm Chief Pappas.

50:22.102 --> 50:24.230
I was wondering if I could have
a few words with your husband.

50:24.313 --> 50:26.782
Thank God! They grabbed one of
my students. You got to stop them.

50:26.857 --> 50:30.828
You wouldn't mind coming down to
the station with me, would you?

51:01.976 --> 51:02.977
Hey, pal!

51:03.060 --> 51:05.358
- Okay, please.
- Come on!

51:05.437 --> 51:09.283
- Hit the road, Chip.
- You're making your Sunday drive, Chip.

51:18.284 --> 51:20.707
You haven't met North yet, Chip.

51:20.786 --> 51:24.416
He just came up from down South.

51:24.498 --> 51:28.219
After you're gone, he's gonna
take your seat in class.

51:33.674 --> 51:36.803
Did you have a nice talk
with Jimmy, Chip?

51:37.344 --> 51:41.099
What did you talk about?
Did you talk about us?

51:41.640 --> 51:44.519
You're gonna have a fun ride, Chip.

51:46.645 --> 51:48.238
Now would you listen to me?

51:48.314 --> 51:52.319
There's this kid, Chip Conway, and if
we don't help him he is going to die.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.244
Those punks have him in their car.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.320
And they're gonna kill him like they
killed Billy and like they killed Kate.

51:57.364 --> 52:00.709
I know. Okay, sir, I know.
You said that.

52:01.452 --> 52:05.753
You see, well, you seem
to know an awful lot.

52:05.831 --> 52:08.380
A lot of stuff that nobody could
possibly know anything about.

52:08.459 --> 52:11.929
Like finding the girl in the barn.

52:12.004 --> 52:15.850
Like just happening to be on hand
when Billy Stearns was killed.

52:15.924 --> 52:18.768
So you tell me, what
I'm supposed to think?

52:18.844 --> 52:21.063
Look, I don't know what
you're supposed to think.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.357
All I know is my
family is in danger.

52:23.432 --> 52:26.402
- From who? Your students?
- Yes!

52:26.977 --> 52:29.776
God damn it, you charge me
with murder or you let me go!

52:29.855 --> 52:31.732
You sit down!

52:35.986 --> 52:38.705
Does my driving scare you, Chip?

52:38.781 --> 52:42.627
Oh, he's a tough man.
He ain't scared of anything!

52:50.376 --> 52:51.923
Still not scared, huh?

52:52.002 --> 52:54.471
No, no, you're cool as a
corpse, right, Chippie?

53:01.929 --> 53:05.183
Well, boys, what's it gonna
take to scare this guy?

53:05.265 --> 53:09.315
- The face.
- Oh, man, the face?

53:09.937 --> 53:11.564
You do it, North.

53:12.398 --> 53:14.446
That's for kids, man.

53:15.067 --> 53:16.740
I'll do it.

53:16.819 --> 53:19.993
Man, we must be bored
doing this crap.

53:32.209 --> 53:37.261
It ain't working, Vinnie. He ain't scared.
Are you, Chippie, you Knucklehead?

53:44.888 --> 53:46.606
Time to rock, jock.

54:22.968 --> 54:24.720
It's Dad!

54:29.349 --> 54:31.522
Dad, how was jail?

54:32.603 --> 54:36.278
Hey, I wasn't in jail, okay? He just
wanted to ask me some questions.

54:36.356 --> 54:40.202
Scottie, go in and finish your
breakfast. You've got school.

54:40.861 --> 54:42.454
Okay...

54:47.951 --> 54:49.703
They think you killed
Billy and Kate.

54:49.787 --> 54:53.382
- Yeah, but they have no evidence.
- What are you gonna do?

54:53.457 --> 54:56.006
I'm going in to teach. Now,
come on, I want a cup of coffee.

54:56.084 --> 55:00.965
Talk to me, Jim. Why would
they think such a thing?

55:01.048 --> 55:04.723
- Because they're being made to think it.
- By whom?

55:04.802 --> 55:07.305
Please don't shut me out.

55:07.387 --> 55:10.311
We got through your last
breakdown by talking things out.

55:10.390 --> 55:13.610
I don't wanna talk it out,
okay? I'm tired.

55:13.685 --> 55:17.610
I know. You haven't slept for more than
three hours in the last four days.

55:17.689 --> 55:21.159
Look what you're doing to yourself.
I feel as if I'm losing you.

55:21.235 --> 55:24.865
You're not losing me. I just...
I need a little more time, that's all.

55:24.947 --> 55:28.747
I just need some time
to figure this thing out.

55:47.469 --> 55:52.316
It seems another one of your
students did disappear last night.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.402
Chip?

55:55.477 --> 55:59.323
- I told you.
- Yeah. Amazing.

56:01.108 --> 56:04.203
We'll let you know when
we find something.

56:04.278 --> 56:08.749
Or you let us know when
you remember something.

56:50.908 --> 56:55.163
Say, Jimmy, you remember
North here, don't you?

56:55.245 --> 56:57.668
He decided to come up and
visit when Chip cashed in.

56:57.748 --> 57:00.217
Transferred up from Milford.

57:00.292 --> 57:02.715
Now we can finish
unfinished business, Jimmy.

57:02.794 --> 57:06.389
You always wanted to be like
your brother, didn't you, Jimmy?

57:06.465 --> 57:08.934
- Yeah, dead.
- Very dead.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.764
- You can't run away this time.
- Tonight's the big night, Jimmy.

57:12.846 --> 57:14.848
Don't tell us you don't remember
today's the anniversary?

57:14.932 --> 57:17.981
He probably forgets his wife's.

57:18.060 --> 57:23.112
And speaking of family, how's
that kid of yours, Jimmy?

57:23.190 --> 57:25.033
Bet he's a chicken.

57:27.402 --> 57:30.702
- Just like his old man.
- We'll find out.

57:31.865 --> 57:34.163
See you tonight, Jimmy boy.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.459
Be there or be square, man.

57:43.043 --> 57:45.171
Leave my family out of this!

57:45.253 --> 57:48.553
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Come on, don't hurt us.

57:48.632 --> 57:50.726
Hey, be cool, man.

58:04.564 --> 58:08.410
And after that level, you turn
into a rocket. It's really cool.

58:08.485 --> 58:11.284
Well, anyways, see you guys later.

58:50.694 --> 58:54.824
Mommy, help me! Please, help me!
Somebody help!

58:54.906 --> 58:58.035
Help! Please! Help me!

59:11.840 --> 59:13.433
What happened?

59:13.508 --> 59:15.602
Thank God, he's okay.

59:15.677 --> 59:18.931
Some guys in a black
car tried to hit him.

59:19.014 --> 59:20.812
The cops are out looking for them.

59:20.891 --> 59:24.521
- Did anybody else see the car?
- No, just Scotty.

59:26.438 --> 59:30.944
Well, we'll get you inside.
Let's get you cleaned up.

59:37.991 --> 59:41.837
Now you don't have to sleep.
I just want you to rest. Okay?

59:45.707 --> 59:47.505
Dad?

59:48.627 --> 59:50.846
Can we leave here?

59:55.383 --> 59:59.229
It won't happen again,
Scotty. I promise you.

59:59.304 --> 01:00:02.683
We're all gonna be fine. Okay?

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:09.277
You know, I have been saving something
for you and I wanted you to have it.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:12.235
I've just been waiting
for the perfect time.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:15.787
This was given to me
when I was your age.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:20.626
And it means a lot to me.
I want you to have it.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.084
Thanks, Dad.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.376
It's cool.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.804
Looking good.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.857
Sally?

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.405
Honey?

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:00.954
Sally?

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.832
Sally?

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.965
- Didn't you hear me?
- The dryer was on.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.301
You got to listen to me.

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:19.555
There are some punks in my
class and they're after me.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:22.103
They are the ones that
tried to scare Scotty.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:25.023
That's what this is about.
They're killers.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:29.569
They killed Billy, they killed
Kate and now they want me.

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:34.617
Why would kids in your
class wanna kill you?

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:39.784
They're the same guys
that killed my brother.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:45.081
Jim, how do you expect
me to respond to that?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.754
The boys who killed
your brother are dead.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:52.710
They were killed by a train. You know
that. How could they be alive?

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.169
They're not.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:59.349
Twenty-seven years ago, today, they killed
Wayne and now they came back for me.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:03.145
They told me, they're gonna play
this whole thing out again.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.643
Look, I am not crazy.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.941
You got to believe me.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:13.356
I want you to lock all the doors and
windows and don't let anybody in.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:30.706
Jimmy?

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:32.587
What's wrong?

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:45.604
Excuse me. I need to find a policeman
from about 20, 25 years ago.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.808
- His name was Nell. Officer Nell.
- That'd be Bob Nell.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.143
Right. I got to see him.
It's very, very important.

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:53.695
No, he hasn't been on
the force in years.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.023
He got shot during a burglary
call some years ago.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.733
Almost died, poor bastard.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:00.035
He's over in Smithfield now,
the retirement home.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.114
I got to warn you, he's
gone around the bend a bit.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:07.076
Ever since his accident,
he thinks he sees dead people.

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:14.049
Jimmy?

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:18.720
- Jimmy Norman!
- My God, you remember me.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:23.926
You look into a person's eyes,
you always know who he is or was.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.145
I've been waiting for you, son.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:36.613
Hey, slow it down.
This is a residential area.

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:41.029
Jimmy and Wayne Norman.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:44.659
- You two were something else.
- Yes, sir, we were.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.744
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:54.711
those boys, the ones
who killed Wayne...

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.962
I think they're back again.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.093
I know. I saw him.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.927
- You saw who?
- Your brother Wayne.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:09.520
He needs you to settle it.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:10.643
Wayne?

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:16.153
There was this routine burglary.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.740
Routine except that
I got shot in the head.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:23.739
The doctors said I was clinically
dead for over three minutes.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:28.164
And that's when I saw him,
Wayne, from the other side.

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:32.210
He was waiting,
stuck in that midrealm.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:37.549
That dimension between here
and one's final destination.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:42.171
Sometimes, son,
they're in our hearts.

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:45.382
Sometimes they're in our thoughts.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:50.062
But if they're unhappy enough,
if something's left unsettled...

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.938
sometimes they come back.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.607
They...

01:04:57.685 --> 01:05:03.909
Those punks told me they had
transferred in from Milford.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.908
I checked. I can't
find any Milford High.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.952
That's because it isn't a school.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:43.731
Lawson.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.328
North.

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:56.544
Vincent.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:02.919
- Hey, Mueller! Mueller!
- You coward.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.637
Mueller...

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.802
Yes...

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:18.187
- Welcome to Milford, Jimmy.
- Looking for Mueller, kid?

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:22.112
You're gonna need him
to put this all together.

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:26.533
- Unless we find him first.
- So you better get going, Daddy-O.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:29.202
You don't have much time.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:34.658
You're going down tonight, Jimmy!
Tonight, Jimmy!

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:16.533
I'm looking for Karl Mueller.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.289
Who are you?

01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:23.207
Jimmy Norman. Wayne
Norman's little brother.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.880
What do you want?

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.850
Boy, look at you.

01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:36.269
You're the man who punched
my big brother...

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:40.144
knocked him down on the ground and
kicked him when he was defenseless, huh?

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:43.443
Is this what happens to
tough guys like you, huh?

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:50.157
That thing with your
brother was an accident!

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:54.158
Hell, I almost got killed myself.
I just got out right before the train hit.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:58.583
- Come on, you're coming with me.
- Hey, where are you taking me, man?

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:02.044
Let's go!

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:05.164
Come on, get out!

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:10.553
- What is this? What are we doing here?
- Reliving your past.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:11.629
Come on!

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:13.841
Mueller, don't you know?
Your buddies are back.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.392
Lawson, Vinnie, North!

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:19.390
For every life they took,
one of them came back.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.519
Seems they're here to finish up some old
business and we're part of the plan.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.148
- You're crazy!
- Yeah?

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:29.026
All right, I'm here with Mueller!

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.448
I'm waiting for you!

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.653
This is freaking crazy. You're nuts!
I'm getting out of here.

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:39.116
Mueller, come back here!
You coward!

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:04.112
Hello, Mrs. Norman. Can
Jimmy come out and play?

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.346
Welcome to the
neighborhood, Mrs. Norman.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.896
Hello, baby!

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:07.842
Nice shooting, Jimbo.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:12.480
But you can't kill
what's already dead.

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:18.648
All right, come on. Come on,
I'm not running this time.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.105
Good, then we'll see you there.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:22.281
We wanted to make sure
you were coming, Jimmy.

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:26.236
Bring the wife and kid.
It's fun for the whole family.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:33.455
Come on, let's go.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:36.413
- Where are we gonna go?
- Someplace safe.

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:44.386
Come on, come on!

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.432
Get inside, come on!

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:03.107
Come on now. You and Scotty
will be safe in here.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.362
My brother promised me.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.827
They were the ones who
killed him, weren't they?

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:13.329
Yeah. And my students.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.419
Why are they after you?

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.755
Hey, kid!

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:32.386
- They want revenge.
- For what?

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:36.181
- Something that happened on that day.
- Oh, let's just go.

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:38.391
We could just get in the
car and never come back.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.694
No, they'll find me. They'll
follow me no matter where I go.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.771
I can't keep running.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:49.824
I have to change what happened,
and then after tonight it'll all be over.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.830
Jim?

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.997
I'm so sorry that I doubted you.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.458
I love you.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:09.547
I will come back.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:13.467
So you were the one who took them.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.939
What are you doing here, Mueller?

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:29.111
I've been coming by
this place for years.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:33.862
I used to park my car across the street
at night and just look at the place.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:38.913
I watched it fall apart,
just like me.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:41.582
I never meant anything to
happen to your brother.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:46.504
You got to believe me. My life's
been hell since that clay.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:52.214
I know it's crazy,
but I believe what you say.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.964
I believe they're back.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:18:00.726
I guess somehow I always
knew they would be.

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:10.402
- So what do you wanna do?
- I'm tired of being afraid.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:15.775
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.946
Let's do it.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:19:00.077
You know, I bet Vinnie
here a whole nickel...

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:03.372
that your old clunker
wouldn't burn rubber, Jimmy.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:05.541
But I was wrong.

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.789
Everything burns.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:11.498
What do you know?
It's Mueller time.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.207
Is that you, Mueller?

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.884
What are you doing, man?
You belong with us, remember?

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.590
Look at you. You used
to be cool, man.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:21.925
- Until your little belly turned yellow.
- My God!

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.554
- You got old.
- And ugly.

01:19:23.634 --> 01:19:25.602
You stink, but we
missed you, Mueller.

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:29.603
You're gonna stand with us,
just like old times, man.

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:36.905
The gang's all here.
Everybody except for Wayne.

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:40.613
He's a definite no-show.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:54.415
No! No!

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:04.300
- So, where we going?
- You don't know?

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:06.056
He sure as hell does.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:08.888
We're going to the tunnel
for old times' sake, Mueller.

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:12.316
But first, I thought we'd stop off at
the old church to see some friends.

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.486
Mom?

01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:29.292
- I'm hungry.
- Soon, when your father gets back.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.333
It's Dad!

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:34.538
Scotty!

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:39.006
- Scotty, no.
- Did you light a candle for me?

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:41.678
- What are you waiting for?
- Go ahead.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:44.052
Yeah, you first, Einstein.

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:59.314
Light a candle for me, Sally!
Come on out here, pretty baby!

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:26.264
Oh, please, Wayne. Please, help me.

01:21:27.424 --> 01:21:31.645
I need you. I can't
do this by myself.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:36.813
No matter what the pain
or the cost, I'll pay it.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.486
Please, please, help me!

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.872
Wayne! Please!

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:37.206
Please, help me!

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:40.206
Did you feel that?

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.962
Yup.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.135
I thought I felt someone
trying to come through.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:49.556
Hey, Mueller,
maybe it was your mama.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.226
Maybe it was your mama, North!

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:55.558
Sally?

01:22:57.055 --> 01:23:01.652
We're gonna come back when we're
welcome, baby, around midnight.

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:05.105
Come on, Mueller.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:25.884
- Scott?
- Dad's here!

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.222
Scott!

01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:34.552
You love your daddy, Scott?

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:39.366
It's a nice kid you
got here, Mrs. Norman.

01:23:39.392 --> 01:23:42.509
If you hurt him,
I swear to God, I'll...

01:23:42.559 --> 01:23:45.563
Hey, come on, don't hurt the kid!

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.990
Shut up, Mueller.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:05.003
Don't you know, Sally, that
nobody hits me and lives?

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:08.002
You're lucky I have a
date tonight to keep.

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:12.010
Otherwise you and I might have
a little fun of our own! Huh?

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:16.351
It's time to wail, boys.

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:29.569
"How much is three
times two, times two?"

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:33.824
"Oh, that's easy, 12."

01:24:35.612 --> 01:24:41.210
"Like I always said, Jimmy, you got
all the brains in the family."

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:48.008
"You're not gonna go through
the tunnel, are you?"

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.962
"Sure. It's faster."

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:15.952
Hey, buttface,
you're blocking the road.

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:18.622
Oh, sissy with books.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:20.870
Read me a story, sissy?

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.451
Dad! Dad, help!

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:24.536
- Scotty?
- Dad, help!

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.714
Call it insurance, Jimmy.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:30.713
We wanted to make sure you weren't
gonna chicken out on us this time.

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:40.553
Jim!

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.229
Dad!

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:43.726
Jim!

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:59.906
Well, well, well, it's
good to see you, Jimmy.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:02.332
You know the routine.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:04.409
- How much money have you got?
- Twelve cents.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:07.497
Liar. You gonna run and tell on us?

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.003
- I'm not running anywhere.
- Good.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:18.466
'Cause we're gonna finish it this time.
And you're gonna come with us.

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:24.396
Wayne, I know you're
with me. I can feel you.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.733
What's going on?

01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:36.488
This. You wanna get through this
tunnel, you gotta pay, get it?

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:39.657
- So how much money have you got?
- Jim!

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:42.330
I told you, 12 cents.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:46.702
- Mueller, what the hell are you doing?
- Leave him alone.

01:26:46.785 --> 01:26:50.289
Vinnie, get this bum out
before I smack him!

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.845
What are you doing? You're
not supposed to kill him!

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:04.269
- You're gonna mess the whole thing up!
- Shut up!

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.597
He deserved it!

01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:12.816
For every life they take,
another can come back, right?

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:28.584
We're gonna have company, boys.

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.853
My God!

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:00.400
Wayne?

01:28:00.484 --> 01:28:02.236
Now the gang's all here, Vinnie.

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:04.947
- Leave us alone.
- Shut up!

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:07.791
Shut up.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:10.107
You wanna get through this
tunnel, you gotta pay, get it?

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.289
- We're not going back!
- No!

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:15.590
There ain't no other way
back except our way!

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:18.418
I said, leave us alone.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:36.482
You ain't coming
back this time, kid!

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.407
Vinnie, heads up!

01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:48.867
Man, nobody hits me.

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:55.831
Oh, my God.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.757
There's no train running
through here anymore.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:02.054
- Run, Jimmy, run!
- Lawson? Remember this?

01:29:04.297 --> 01:29:06.550
This is why you died.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:22.949
No way.

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:31.746
It's all over, Lawson.
Now you can go to hell!

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:36.001
- Next time, man, there's always next time.
- No, this is it.

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:38.457
Come on. Let's go!

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:42.423
Come on.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.933
Come on. Come on. Run for it.

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:50.602
Go!

01:29:50.677 --> 01:29:53.430
- Come on, come on.
- No!

01:29:57.517 --> 01:30:01.522
- Come on! Come on!
- Hey, kid!

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:08.362
Get down!

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:40.818
Dad!

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:46.533
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:30:47.734 --> 01:30:49.236
Okay-

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:52.869
Jimmy?

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:59.122
- No, Jim's my dad.
- But that's my cap. I gave it to Jimmy.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:00.956
I know you did.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:04.835
And I gave it to my son.

01:31:04.918 --> 01:31:08.263
His name is Scott.
He's named after our dad.

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:13.302
I'm your brother, Wayne. I'm Jimmy.

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:19.058
No, that can't be.
Jimmy's my little brother.

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:26.083
- I'm still your little brother.
- My brother's nine years old.

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:27.858
I grew up.

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:31.111
It's been 27 years since...

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:36.875
Since you died.

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:50.972
I don't wanna go back.
Please, I wanna stay.

01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:55.598
- I was all alone there.
- I'd do anything to have you back again...

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:58.772
to make up for all
those lost years.

01:32:01.057 --> 01:32:03.185
You can't stay.

01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:06.821
Then come with me, Jimmy.

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:15.281
Please, Jimmy, I need you with me.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:19.410
We were always gonna stick
together, remember?

01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:24.915
Wayne, please try to understand.

01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:28.210
I can't go with you.

01:32:29.794 --> 01:32:36.302
I have a wife and a son and
I love them very much.

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.136
Wayne?

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:41.519
Jim loves you so much.

01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:44.859
But we need him here.

01:32:44.934 --> 01:32:47.232
Scotty needs him.

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:50.733
The same way that Jimmy needed you.

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:56.201
I can't go with you, Wayne.
But you won't be alone anymore.

01:32:57.113 --> 01:33:01.493
Now that this is over, you're
gonna go to a better place...

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:04.375
where Mom and Dad
are waiting for you.

01:33:05.205 --> 01:33:07.173
I love you, Wayne.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:13.805
And you'll always be in my
heart and in my thoughts.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:21.063
And one day, we'll be
together again, I promise.

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:41.624
Wayne?

01:33:43.493 --> 01:33:47.623

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.668
What are they?

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:34.923
Good luck coins.

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:37.597
My big brother gave them to me.
