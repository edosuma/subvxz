00:06.307 --> 00:06.474
.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.108
BOB: Previously on "Shooter"...

00:09.377 --> 00:11.212
That's six shots. 1,500 yards.
What's that guy's name?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.214
Lon Scott.
He's a hell of a shooter.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.248
If we don't start
working together--

00:14.282 --> 00:15.349
Together?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.218
I know you're onto Lon Scott,

00:17.251 --> 00:19.320
and you are going to need help.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.522
Just because you realized
you're expendable

00:21.555 --> 00:23.324
doesn't make us partners.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.525
It doesn't mean
we don't need to be.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.594
I need a path out.
Find Payne.

00:26.627 --> 00:31.265
Get the thumb drive.
I'll fund your IRA.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.567
[groans]
God, you're a dumb-ass.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.503
The thumb drive?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.138
LON: They hired Swagger
to kill us.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.439
Now he's gonna
kill them instead.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.141
You arranged this
with Swagger?

00:40.174 --> 00:41.575
Worth the risk in order
to get my shot at him.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.844
For years, I wanted to be
as good as you, but...

00:43.877 --> 00:45.179
we both know I'm better now.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.414
I'm the sniper.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.282
You're just a...marksman.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.118
You could be implicated,
too, Lon.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.121
Anhur is all over
that thumb drive.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.622
You know Swagger's here, right?
I had hoped so.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.125
Why?
Because you failed.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.459
Now I'm gonna finish it.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.594
Swagger still lives.
It's being handled.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.530
I don't like the unknown.

01:02.563 --> 01:06.267
Then get out of
the espionage business.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.569
Perhaps we'll dig a hole
for you, Mr. Meachum.

01:10.404 --> 01:14.308
Swagger's gone.
He's got Annex B.

01:14.342 --> 01:17.178
KRUKOV: Our mutual friends
will not be pleased.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.346
Good-bye, Mr. Meachum.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.547
Hey, you remember
the old Ranger station?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.215
Are we in trouble?

01:21.249 --> 01:22.583
BOB: I need you and Mary
to get there

01:22.616 --> 01:23.684
as soon as you can.
Can you slip away quietly?

01:23.717 --> 01:26.187
Yes, definitely.
Where are you going?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.455
You've always covered for me.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.390
I need you to do it
this one last time.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.892
Can I speak to Julie?
Simon Porter. She knows me.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.162
You've got one second to get
your foot out of my door

01:34.195 --> 01:35.896
before I break it.
LON: What do you want, Porter?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.331
Julie Swagger's gone.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.666
I'll have someone there
within the hour.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.568
Mama needs you underneath
the bed, all right?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.503
You can't come out
until Mama comes back for you.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.305
Okay? Promise me.
Promise.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.240
[door shuts]

01:46.274 --> 01:48.209
JULIE: Hey!
[gun shots]

01:48.242 --> 01:51.212
[dramatic music]

01:51.245 --> 01:54.615

01:54.648 --> 01:56.584

01:56.617 --> 01:59.620

[gun cocks]

02:06.494 --> 02:07.928
*

02:07.961 --> 02:09.263
NADINE: Okay.

02:09.297 --> 02:12.600
*

02:12.633 --> 02:15.503
Howard says we should report
them officially kidnapped,

02:15.536 --> 02:17.638
and the FBI can start
a coordinated operation

02:17.671 --> 02:19.507
and find them.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.243
No.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.646
You're underestimating
the bureau.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.648
What am I supposed to say
when he calls back?

02:27.681 --> 02:30.251
I said no, God damn it!

02:30.284 --> 02:33.254
*

02:33.287 --> 02:34.622
I want to find them, too,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.757
but we have no chance
without help.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.359
We do if we strike first.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.528
You're asking me
to violate my oath again.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.296
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.664
The door's right there.
Swagger, I--

02:43.697 --> 02:45.533
Nothing comes before my family!

02:45.566 --> 02:48.536
Not the law, not your
conscience, not your case.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.538
You can't save your family
by killing everyone

02:50.571 --> 02:52.373
that stands
between you and them.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.275
Maybe, maybe not.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.743
Who are you calling?

02:55.776 --> 02:58.812
The asshole who started this.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.182
[cell phone vibrates]

03:03.551 --> 03:04.618
Hello?

03:04.652 --> 03:08.289
We can meet,
or I can hunt you down.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.258
All right.
Text me the location.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.759
I'll come alone.
I really don't give a shit.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.627
Just be there.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.995
Bob Lee?

03:15.028 --> 03:19.833
*

03:19.867 --> 03:22.303
It's Swagger.
He wants to cut a deal.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.272
You should get going.
PAYNE: Yeah.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.307
You didn't really want to be
a part of this anyway. Right?

03:26.340 --> 03:28.476
I don't know why you
brought this asshole back.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.411
Eat my dick.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.613
Jack, despite his manners,
is a value to me.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.249
Especially now.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.718
Don't keep Swagger waiting.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.288
PAYNE: You won't regret
giving me a second chance, Lon.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.723
Just focus.
We need to finish this.

03:42.756 --> 03:49.763
*

03:56.404 --> 03:58.772
Mrs. Swagger, you're even
more beautiful in person

03:58.806 --> 04:00.308
than you are on TV.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.610
And you are?
Someone that can assure

04:02.643 --> 04:04.378
the safety of your family.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.548
As long as you play nice.
Get them in the van.

04:07.581 --> 04:14.588
*

04:16.457 --> 04:18.459
Hey,
where the hell is Meachum?

04:18.492 --> 04:23.631
*

04:23.664 --> 04:26.767
[Meachum groaning]

04:26.800 --> 04:33.807
*

04:36.410 --> 04:37.645
He's alive.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.547
Yes, but he won't be for long.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.282
He crossed one bridge too far.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.285
Good-bye, Mr. Meachum.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.523
[dramatic music]

05:04.405 --> 05:04.738
.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.806
I know you wanted to meet
a few hundred yards away.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.942
But that rifle you're
carrying tells me

05:08.976 --> 05:11.445
it's wise to stop you here.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.113
This needs to end peacefully.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.783
Peace stopped being an option
when you put hands on my family.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.851
That wasn't me.
Bob Lee--

05:17.885 --> 05:19.853
NADINE: Drop your weapon.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.990
[tense music]

05:23.023 --> 05:25.359
You trained her well.
[grunts]

05:26.460 --> 05:28.462
*

05:28.496 --> 05:30.398
Where is my family?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.835
What'd I teach you?

05:34.868 --> 05:36.404
Take your emotions out of it.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.738
If I was being led by
my emotions,

05:37.771 --> 05:40.007
you'd be a pile
of red dirt right now.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.644
*

05:43.677 --> 05:45.112
It's Mary and Julie
for the thumb drive

05:45.145 --> 05:47.014
and the diamonds.
Let me guess.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.817
You'll give us your word that
everything will go smoothly?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.019
I know my word
doesn't mean shit to you...

05:52.052 --> 05:54.822
[panting]
But they want what they want,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.825
and they're willing
to do whatever it takes.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.893
They're not f---ing around.
They buried Meachum

05:59.927 --> 06:01.829
for letting
that thumb drive get away.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.497
And what do you get out of it?

06:03.531 --> 06:05.999
I disappear.
What? With the diamonds?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.035
All this for money?

06:08.068 --> 06:10.404
All this so my wife and I
can make it to safety

06:10.438 --> 06:13.006
and build a new life.
And you get it out of her head,

06:13.040 --> 06:15.142
you're not collaring these guys.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.044
Annex B for your family.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.679
Do you understand?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.013
There's no other play.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.118
Fine, but you play for my team
until this is over.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.087
ISAAC: Agreed.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.023
* If Daddy had to run

06:30.057 --> 06:32.826
* If he had to crawl

06:32.860 --> 06:37.431
both:
* If he had to swim 100 rivers

06:37.465 --> 06:41.802
* Just to climb 1,000 walls

06:41.835 --> 06:45.906
* Always know that
he would find a way *

06:45.939 --> 06:49.076
* To get to where you are

06:49.109 --> 06:52.079
[clapping]

06:52.112 --> 06:54.114
That was beautiful.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.785
Don't stop because of me.

06:57.818 --> 07:01.088
I can't wait for him
to get his hands on you.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.224
[chuckles]
Yeah, well...

07:04.257 --> 07:07.227
been there, done that,

07:07.260 --> 07:10.798
and I'm still standing.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.099
Well, I'm sitting, but--

07:12.132 --> 07:16.504
Mommy, I'm scared.
No. Don't be.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.072
I'm right here.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.241
You're not the one
who should be scared.

07:21.274 --> 07:28.482
*

07:39.292 --> 07:43.864
*

07:43.897 --> 07:45.866
Hold it.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.201
How did our friend
take the news?

07:48.235 --> 07:51.271
Meachum is no longer
my problem.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.206
He failed us
one too many times.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.976
That seemed inevitable.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.911
Are you my problem, Lon?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.180
[chuckles] You mean because
you hired Swagger

08:00.213 --> 08:02.516
to kill me for $10 million?
Yeah.

08:02.550 --> 08:06.219
My understanding is,
you made the same deal.

08:06.253 --> 08:09.289
When you want to kill a wolf,
sometimes you need some sheep.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.824
[door opens]

08:10.858 --> 08:13.026
Was disarming me
really necessary?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.628
I don't trust you.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.263
*

08:16.296 --> 08:18.899
You spoke to Swagger.
He's on a long gun.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.101
I'd stay away
from any windows.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.903
He's outside right now?
Yeah.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.072
And he has Special Agent
Memphis with him.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.107
KRUKOV:
I don't care who's with him.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.076
Is he willing
to bring us Annex B?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.645
As soon as his family
is free, yes.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.582
Evidence first, then family.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.650
We are holding
all the cards.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.586
Swagger doesn't care
about the computer file.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.654
ISAAC: He cares about being
double-crossed,

08:40.688 --> 08:43.323
and we haven't given him
a reason to trust us.

08:43.356 --> 08:48.228
If he was worried about trust,
we'd already be dead.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.230
Set up the deal.

08:50.263 --> 08:55.969
*

08:56.003 --> 08:58.839
He's gonna want to know
that his family's alive.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.842
*

09:01.875 --> 09:04.678
Looks like we have a deal.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.080
That's the first good thing
I've heard all day.

09:07.114 --> 09:14.121
*

09:23.997 --> 09:26.033
He has us scoped right now,
doesn't he?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.167
Yep.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.169
*

09:29.202 --> 09:31.972
I can feel it.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.908
My, God, it's exhilarating.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.344
Lon, it's really not.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.246
*

09:39.279 --> 09:42.249
Isaac would be first.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.953
He's smart under fire, calm.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.123
Krukov would be next.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.893
He's FSB,
so he's well-trained.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.264
Lon Scott would be last.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.332
He's got good instincts,
but he has no idea

09:59.366 --> 10:01.935
what to do when
the target fires back.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.005
He'll freeze up
and I'd smoke him.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.642
He won't do it,
even though he's dying to.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.011
*

10:11.044 --> 10:12.379
NADINE: Bob Lee.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.283
Think about Julie and Mary.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.652
You start shooting,
they'll kill them.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.088
*

10:21.121 --> 10:23.056
Bang.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.425
Bang.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.426
Bang.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.929
Bullet is forever.

10:38.305 --> 10:38.672
.

10:38.706 --> 10:39.472
ISAAC: You tell me
to meet you here,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.142
then you make me wait?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.277
Gotta to make sure
you weren't followed.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.814
You chose to hole up
in an FBI front company,

10:46.847 --> 10:48.716
and you're worried about me
compromising security?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.250
Look around.
That op is over.

10:50.283 --> 10:53.153
Enough.
Is my family alive?

10:54.755 --> 10:57.024
Call this number.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.826
Let me call it in.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.094
Calling the FBI is not
a part of the plan.

You're not dictating the terms.

[phone dialing]

11:09.236 --> 11:11.304
Hey, it's Memphis.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.774
Yeah, let me get
a trace on a number.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.175
Okay, thanks.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.846
804-026-1378.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.048
Okay, we got it.

[cell phone vibrates]

11:23.884 --> 11:25.485
[Julie whispering]

11:25.518 --> 11:28.822
Bob Lee, I've missed you.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.223
Put my wife on the phone.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.425
Well, you could at least
ask me politely.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.062
Put my wife on the phone now.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.264
Honey, it's for you.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.734
Bob Lee?
BOB: I'm here, Julie.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.435
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.171
We were--
Baby, stop it.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.173
You didn't do anything wrong.
Is Mary okay?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.475
Yeah, of course.
She's your daughter.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.911
She'll be better
when she gets to see you.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.746
Let me talk to her.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.782
Okay, hold on.
Mary, it's Daddy.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.316
Daddy...

11:56.349 --> 11:58.285
Where are you?

11:58.318 --> 12:00.788
I miss you so much,
kitten-mouse.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.790
I'm gonna see you real soon.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.925
When?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.761
WOMAN: * Ooh ooh ooh

12:07.795 --> 12:09.096
Tonight.
I promise.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.298
WOMAN: * Ooh ooh ooh

12:11.331 --> 12:13.166
Remember, Daddy loves you
both so much.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.267
WOMAN: * Ahh ahh

12:14.301 --> 12:15.435
We love you too.
JULIE: Hey--

12:15.468 --> 12:16.469
Daddy!

12:16.503 --> 12:19.339
Mary?
Julie!

12:19.372 --> 12:21.508
PAYNE: All right,
so, you got what you wanted.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.310
Put my wife
back on the phone.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.145
PAYNE: We'll send
further instructions.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.347
It's okay.
It's okay.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.849
WOMAN: * Maybe I'm not scared

12:28.882 --> 12:31.384
Daddy's gonna come find us.
I promise.

* What you're thinking now

12:34.855 --> 12:35.856

* And held me miles away

12:40.293 --> 12:42.262
Okay.
Thanks.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.498
83 Bowan Road,
Arlington, Virginia.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.567
It's in an industrial
park owned by Anher.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.470
All right
FBI better not come.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.305
You're jeopardizing
everything.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.441
We have a deal.
A deal?

12:54.474 --> 12:56.176
You really think they're gonna
let you walk away

12:56.209 --> 12:57.510
with the diamonds
after I'm dead?

12:57.544 --> 12:59.847
You think I'm getting
too emotional.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.448
They don't trust you.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.251
Hell, they probably
don't even like you.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.553
One way or another,
this ends in blood.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.421
Look, all I want to do
is get as far away from here

13:08.455 --> 13:10.457
as I can and never come back.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.259
If you just gave me what I want,
I'd be on my way.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.526
I'm not giving you shit!

13:13.560 --> 13:15.262
You lit the fuse when you drove
down my driveway

13:15.295 --> 13:17.397
and you're gonna see it
through to the end.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.433
That's true, but I don't see
a way we walk out of this alive.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.937
I get my wife
and daughter back.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.839
She gets the evidence.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.941
Then, you can f-- off
with your diamonds.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.579
They're never gonna
let that happen.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.215
Look at it this way,
Isaac.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.850
What choice do you have?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.490
Did things go as expected?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.325
PAYNE:
Yeah, he took the bait.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.294
I'm sure he got
a trace on the call.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.929
He'll be coming
for his family.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.531
How soon do you think
we can expect Swagger?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.901
PAYNE: My guess is, they should
be here within the hour.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.036
You want me to stick
with the plan?

13:56.069 --> 13:57.437
Yeah.
I'm on my way.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.907
Make sure we lead him
to the right room.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.876
Copy that.
Happy hunting.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.879
[dark music]

14:05.913 --> 14:07.948
*

14:07.981 --> 14:11.484
I need you to get all of this.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.888
MP-5s, pistol ammo,
rifle ammo,

14:14.922 --> 14:17.324
thermal scope.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.026
A 50 cal?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.928
If I sign out
this much firepower,

14:20.961 --> 14:22.329
it's gonna raise eyebrows.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.931
I don't care.
Call it in.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.234
We'll pick it up
at the armory on the way.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
Okay. Isaac, go,
get the thermals.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.638
You can scope out
from across the street.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.040
Julie and Mary
will be on a floor

14:33.073 --> 14:34.607
that's got heavy security.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.343
Wouldn't it be smarter
to put me on overwatch?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.478
I want you where
I can see you.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.948
So you want me
to provide overwatch?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.615
No, that would
give up your position.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.517
I need you to guide me to family
and keep up an eye out

14:44.551 --> 14:46.286
for any surprises
headed our way.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.455
Okay, what about
what she can't see?

14:48.488 --> 14:51.291
What do you think
I'm bringing you for?

14:59.599 --> 15:02.102
Are you going somewhere?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.371
Have a drink, Grigory.
Relax.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.474
I will have a drink
when this business is over.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.708
And since we're now partners,

15:08.741 --> 15:10.377
I think it's not out
of the question

15:10.410 --> 15:12.445
for me to want to know
what you are planning.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.015
You're not my partner,
and I suggest you show

15:15.048 --> 15:18.385
a little more gratitude
for the hospitality

15:18.418 --> 15:20.053
I've shown you.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.389
I am very grateful,
but as you guessed,

15:22.422 --> 15:24.424
I must confess that I will be
much more comfortable

15:24.457 --> 15:26.393
if you would allow me
to send some of my people

15:26.426 --> 15:29.296
along with you to assist.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.664
So you can get your hands
on your precious Annex B?

15:31.698 --> 15:33.033
That's fine.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.534
Tell them
they're under my command.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.003
But Swagger's mine,
so make sure

15:36.036 --> 15:38.138
they stay out of my way.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.739
Of course.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.109
Just remember,
we did not start this

15:42.142 --> 15:44.411
as a way for you to prove
you are as good as Swagger.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.346
This is about the map
of the world.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.382
I'm better than Swagger.
Get out of my way.

on this side.

Travel to location B.

She knows how
this is gonna go down?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.765

No way.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.401
They're not assets.
They're my family.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.203
And if they're in here,
we're gonna get them.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.604
And if they're not?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.739
Then a lot of people
are gonna die for no reason.

of the building,
top floor.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.692
Any sign of Julie or Mary?

Julie and Mary were never here.

They lured us in here

hadn't gotten in my way.

Your obsession with Swagger
has clouded your judgment.

who I've more to fear from,

20:54.854 --> 20:56.856
Any time.

20:57.857 --> 21:02.462
*

21:12.605 --> 21:13.973
Someone gonna say something?

21:14.006 --> 21:16.843
Leave it alone.
We need a new plan.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.513
Not to sound like
a broken record,

21:20.547 --> 21:22.482
but there's no reason
not to call in the bureau.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.485
I can think of a few reasons.
I didn't ask you.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.855
I care about saving
Bob Lee's family.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.757
Then you should know
the second Lon Scott

21:30.790 --> 21:33.059
gets wind this thing has
gone federal, he'll disappear,

21:33.092 --> 21:36.028
and what do you think happens
to Julie and Mary then?

21:36.062 --> 21:38.431
It's not your call.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.367
Isaac's right.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.969
If the feds get involved,
I'll never see my family again.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.105
I've got a different idea.

21:46.138 --> 21:53.346
*

22:03.656 --> 22:06.025
Sorry about
your lunch choices.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.361
I'm not much of a cook.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.829
How do you expect us
to eat those with our hands

22:09.862 --> 22:12.432
tied behinds our backs?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.501
They told me
to bring you food.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.802
That's food.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.405
[cell phone vibrates]

22:18.438 --> 22:20.407
MARY: Mommy...
Hey.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.809
KRUKOV:
Lon Scott is out of control.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.544
Oh, yeah?
Well...

22:24.577 --> 22:26.045
if you feel that way, Grig,
perhaps you should

22:26.078 --> 22:27.647
take it up with him.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.949
You really want your fate
tied to such a man?

22:29.982 --> 22:32.585
PAYNE: Look,
if you'd have just paid me,

22:32.619 --> 22:35.622
you wouldn't be in this jam.
So quit your bitching.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.425
Lon has a score to settle,
and I'm not crossing it.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.427
You have already crossed it.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.029
Yeah, and he let me back in.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.531
So I'm gonna be
a good little soldier

22:44.564 --> 22:45.898
from this point on.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.066
KRUKOV: I'm glad to hear it,

22:47.099 --> 22:48.635
but even the most loyal soldier

22:48.668 --> 22:50.603
needs someone
to cover his flank.

22:50.637 --> 22:53.072
Even you must realize
you're expendable.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.841
[chuckles]

22:56.676 --> 22:59.646
[dramatic music]

22:59.679 --> 23:05.418
*

23:05.452 --> 23:07.987
Tell Lon Scott I'm here.
MAN: Hold it right there!

23:08.020 --> 23:10.523
Sir, Bob Lee Swagger's
here at the gate.

23:10.557 --> 23:14.427
*

23:14.461 --> 23:15.928
He wants him
brought inside.

23:15.962 --> 23:22.969
*

23:31.010 --> 23:38.017
*

23:44.090 --> 23:47.226
Do you guys all have
the same tailor?

23:47.259 --> 23:48.728
Where do you hide
the protection?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.730
MAN: Shut up.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.064
You're wearing Kevlar,
right?

23:52.098 --> 23:53.132
MAN: Keep walking.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.134
*

23:55.167 --> 23:56.969
BOB LEE: Just answer
one question.

23:57.003 --> 24:00.473
Is it that Kevlar level 3A,
the good shit?

24:00.507 --> 24:02.575

24:16.188 --> 24:18.658
[gasps]
You know who I am?

24:18.691 --> 24:20.560
Tell Mr. Scott
I'll be in his office.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.928
I know the way.

24:24.096 --> 24:30.603
*

24:30.637 --> 24:32.171
Is my family alive?

24:32.204 --> 24:34.674
It's never been
my intent to harm them.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.511
Are you here to kill me?

24:38.545 --> 24:40.513
I don't talk about killing,
Lon.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.014
I just do it.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.283
I'm clearly more
than just talk as well.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.520
You saw what I did
to the Ukrainian president.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.255
Too bad everyone thinks
the U.S. president

24:49.288 --> 24:50.690
was the target.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.959
Hey, congratulations
on making the most-famous

24:52.992 --> 24:54.060
missed shot in history.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.528
[chuckles]

24:55.562 --> 24:58.030
I'm planning
an even longer shot,

24:58.064 --> 25:00.099
one that will be
a world record.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.801
Oh, yeah?
I think your daddy's money

25:01.834 --> 25:04.671
has given you
false confidence.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.540
Well, my daddy's money
didn't give me ability.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.975
You of all people
should know that.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.242
Oh, come on, man.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.579
The Black King,
your special bullets--

25:12.612 --> 25:14.547
I could hand you
a Stradivarius.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.082
Doesn't mean you'd play
like Paganini

25:16.115 --> 25:17.684
I don't speak trust fund.
[chuckles]

25:17.717 --> 25:18.785
I'll ask again.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.554
Is my family alive?

25:21.588 --> 25:23.723
Reaching for my phone.

25:24.824 --> 25:31.998
*

25:33.733 --> 25:36.102
You could've recorded that
at any time.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.770
Speak to them.

25:37.804 --> 25:44.811
*

25:53.686 --> 25:55.822
JULIE: Hello?
Baby...

25:55.855 --> 25:58.190
Bob Lee, hey--

25:58.224 --> 26:00.693
Is that Daddy?
Where are you?

26:00.727 --> 26:02.161
JULIE: Can you see us?

26:02.194 --> 26:05.031
Yeah, yeah.
JULIE: Yeah, where are you?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.132
I'm right there with you,
Julie.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.667
Believe me.
Okay.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.736
Daddy...
We love you very--

26:09.769 --> 26:10.770
Uh.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.772
*

26:12.805 --> 26:14.674
Where are they?

26:14.707 --> 26:16.876
They're safe,
and they'll remain safe.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.144
That's disappointing.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.178
This isn't a game, man!

26:19.211 --> 26:20.847
It's my family!

26:20.880 --> 26:22.882
*

26:22.915 --> 26:24.884
You let them go,

26:24.917 --> 26:28.054
I'll give you that shot
you've been hoping for.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.822
I swear.

26:29.856 --> 26:32.091
Once I know they're safe,
I'll stand there

26:32.124 --> 26:35.161
and let you pop rounds off
all day.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.764
You in or not?
'Cause I'm gonna keep coming

26:37.797 --> 26:39.298
until I either find them
or die,

26:39.331 --> 26:40.633
but chances are,
it's gonna be

26:40.667 --> 26:43.202
someone else's kill,
not yours.

26:43.235 --> 26:48.107
Be at the Great Meadow
Golf Course, one hour.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.376
If you bring the evidence,

26:50.409 --> 26:52.879
you have my word
I'll release your family.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.314
You don't give a shit
about the evidence.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.884
You're right.
I don't.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.852
I never have.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.888
You can leave
the way you came in.

27:12.031 --> 27:12.364
.

27:12.398 --> 27:12.699
He'll be here.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.303
He never could
follow orders.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.339
You want to leave?
Go ahead.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.974
You know, if Bob Lee
can learn to work with me,

27:22.008 --> 27:22.975
you can too.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.977
[laughs softly]

27:25.011 --> 27:28.014
I wouldn't take his
lack of hostility as trust.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.118
All right, ladies,
cheer up.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.086
We're going to see your daddy.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.722
Really?

27:35.755 --> 27:37.323
Oh, honey,

27:37.356 --> 27:40.326
I would never lie to you
about something like that.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.429

27:43.462 --> 27:46.098
ISAAC: You make a deal?
Yeah, a bad one.

27:46.132 --> 27:49.101
But it's the only chance
of saving Julie and Mary.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.003
*

27:51.037 --> 27:53.773
The exchange is gonna go down
at the Great Meadow Golf Course.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.407
We gotta move.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.409
We're gonna need the 50 cal.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.012
Lon Scott wants to take me out
with a long shot.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.848
With his skill,
he could be shooting

28:01.881 --> 28:04.116
from almost any distance
with a line of sight.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.885
Don't worry about saving me.

28:05.918 --> 28:09.121
Just make sure
Julie and Mary get away safe.

28:09.155 --> 28:12.124
Hey, if something
happens to me...

28:27.439 --> 28:29.408
Yeah,
but I just want to make sure

28:29.441 --> 28:31.343
you realize that if you do this,

28:31.377 --> 28:33.379
Lon's coming after you next.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.447
Just focus on getting
that evidence

28:35.481 --> 28:37.750
and escaping
without getting killed.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.485
Oh, don't worry about me.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.121
I figured out a way
to make sure I stay alive.

What we're looking at is
over 2,000 yards away.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.900
We'd have a hard time seeing him
if he was out in the open.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.469
You can make a shot that far?

30:03.502 --> 30:04.503
No.

30:04.536 --> 30:08.007

30:08.040 --> 30:10.109
You know what?
I'm gonna cover the other side.

At least we won't be surprised.

anyone inside.

Something's up.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.036
I don't have a clear view.

It seems like
some sort of transfer.

on your head,

Hey, you may want
to back up there, Bob,

Okay?

will pull the trigger,

34:49.855 --> 34:56.862
*

35:01.500 --> 35:02.801
Go.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.336
Bob Lee, go, please.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.671
Baby, it's gonna be okay.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.406
You got to trust me.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.542

[gunshot echoes]

35:13.845 --> 35:16.315

35:16.348 --> 35:19.685
Well, we both know
he's got you bracketed now.

35:19.718 --> 35:25.391
*

35:25.424 --> 35:26.858
I want your last thought
to be about

35:26.892 --> 35:30.829
what I'm gonna do to her
after you're gone.

35:30.862 --> 35:35.701
*

35:35.734 --> 35:38.837
Go, go!
Please.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.706
Go find Mary.
Go!

35:40.739 --> 35:47.746

35:55.887 --> 35:57.856
You've got to trust me.

[explosion echoes]

36:08.634 --> 36:11.870
[panting]

36:11.903 --> 36:13.872
I guess he found my bullet.

36:13.905 --> 36:20.912
*

36:24.416 --> 36:26.218
What the hell are you doing?

36:26.252 --> 36:27.619
[inhales]

36:27.653 --> 36:29.221
[exhales]

[gunshot]

36:32.924 --> 36:34.760
[groans]

36:34.793 --> 36:35.861
I got it.
Baby, I got it.

36:35.894 --> 36:38.864
[Payne groaning]

36:38.897 --> 36:44.936
*

36:44.970 --> 36:46.772
Here.
Here.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.908

36:49.941 --> 36:50.942
[screaming]

36:52.578 --> 36:53.979
Let me do it.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.515
[Payne groaning]

36:56.548 --> 36:57.716
Aah!

36:57.749 --> 36:59.418
I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.586
[screaming]

37:00.619 --> 37:02.654
[Payne groans]

37:02.688 --> 37:05.524
Where the hell
is my daughter?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.259
[laughs]
You'll never shoot.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.661
[groaning]

37:09.695 --> 37:11.863
You're a housewife.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.665
*

37:13.699 --> 37:15.667
I'm a Swagger.

37:15.701 --> 37:22.574
*

37:22.608 --> 37:24.042
We have to find Mary.
We have to.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.577
Some man took her
from the back of the--

37:25.611 --> 37:26.945
a van a few minutes ago.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.614
Look, we have to get her.
We are gonna get her back.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.715
We have to.
Okay?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.717
No, no. No.
Yes, yes. Calm down.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.285
If we lose our heads,
we lose everything.

37:33.319 --> 37:34.686
No, listen, listen,
you don't--you don't know

37:34.720 --> 37:36.054
where she is.
You don't know who took her.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.823
What's going on?
We have to go to the FBI.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.991
You do that, they'll kill her.
What?

37:40.025 --> 37:41.660
Sweetheart, he's with me.
What?

37:41.693 --> 37:42.928
It's complicated, honey.
What?

37:42.961 --> 37:44.496
It's complicated.
No, it's not.

37:44.530 --> 37:45.831
That is the asshole
who started all of this.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.533
And I'm the asshole
who's gonna help end it.

37:47.566 --> 37:48.967
We got to clear
this location now.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.569
No, I don't trust him.
I don't trust him.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.003
You don't have to trust him.
Trust me.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.572
If I didn't think he could
help us get Mary back,

37:53.605 --> 37:54.840
he wouldn't be here.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.009
[cell phone vibrates]

37:58.043 --> 38:00.979
Hello?
NADINE: Thank God, you're alive.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.581
Someone took Mary.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.983
I know.
Krukov has her.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.519
I followed them, but...

38:07.553 --> 38:08.887
I've gone as far as I can go.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.856
What do you mean,
"As far as you can go"?

38:10.889 --> 38:12.023
You lost them?

38:12.057 --> 38:14.025
No.
I'm--

38:14.059 --> 38:16.094
Where are they?

38:16.127 --> 38:22.100

38:22.133 --> 38:25.103
[unintelligible chatter]

38:25.136 --> 38:27.839
