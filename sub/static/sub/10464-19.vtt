WEBVTT

00:04.195 --> 00:06.757
So this whole leap year thing
doesn't freak you out at all?

00:06.781 --> 00:08.291
Why would it?

00:08.867 --> 00:10.428
I don't know. Just the idea

00:10.452 --> 00:13.472
that's there's this... this
day that doesn't even exist.

00:13.496 --> 00:14.807
Like a phantom day.

00:14.831 --> 00:16.350
But it's just science, Bailey.

00:16.373 --> 00:17.977
I mean if we didn't add the day,

00:18.001 --> 00:20.771
eventually, you know, we'd end
up with sun and snow in June.

00:20.795 --> 00:22.732
Well, see, now,
that's exactly it.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.692
That's exactly what
freaks me out about it.

00:24.716 --> 00:26.142
That that could happen.

00:27.469 --> 00:28.613
What are you doing?

00:28.637 --> 00:30.489
I'm having an existential
crisis out here,

00:30.513 --> 00:32.700
and you're, like,
rearranging my clothes.

00:32.723 --> 00:33.868
I am not.

00:33.892 --> 00:34.827
Then what are you doing?

00:34.851 --> 00:36.277
It's a surprise.

00:36.311 --> 00:38.488
Ah! Brainstorm.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.207
What if we throw a
leap year party.

00:40.231 --> 00:41.459
If you're surrounded by friends,

00:41.483 --> 00:43.242
maybe it'll help you
through the trauma.

00:43.610 --> 00:44.911
Maybe.

00:47.030 --> 00:48.706
Okay. Ready?

00:49.157 --> 00:50.833
Ta-da!

00:52.619 --> 00:54.087
What do you think?

01:01.503 --> 01:02.855
Oh. Oh, God.

01:02.879 --> 01:03.856
You know, I can take it back.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.441
No! Don't...

01:05.465 --> 01:07.526
I mean... I mean...

01:07.550 --> 01:08.861
no.

01:08.885 --> 01:09.862
Are you sure?

01:09.886 --> 01:12.188
You know, because it's not
really my normal style.

01:13.139 --> 01:15.534
Maybe it's a new me emerging.

01:15.558 --> 01:18.528
Yeah, well... emerge over here.

01:24.526 --> 01:26.754
So... this leap
year party thing,

01:26.778 --> 01:28.162
what do you say?

01:28.363 --> 01:29.872
Yes...

01:30.281 --> 01:32.583
to absolutely anything.

01:38.164 --> 01:39.642
Well, here.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.268
You have a history
test on Monday.

01:41.292 --> 01:43.302
So I figured you
might want to...

01:46.131 --> 01:49.235
I also brought you a
note from Nina, um...

01:49.259 --> 01:50.653
the <i>Grant High Spectator,</i>

01:50.677 --> 01:53.229
and a new class
president ballot.

02:00.145 --> 02:01.863
Lots of people are
asking about you.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.167
Asking what?

02:05.191 --> 02:06.784
How you are?

02:07.152 --> 02:08.995
what's wrong, when
you're gonna be back.

02:09.571 --> 02:10.631
And what do you tell them?

02:10.655 --> 02:12.591
I tell 'em you're okay,

02:12.615 --> 02:14.135
you had a stomach virus,

02:14.159 --> 02:16.127
and you're gonna be
back really soon.

02:18.288 --> 02:19.630
Are you?

02:20.248 --> 02:22.258
Gonna be back soon?

02:23.126 --> 02:24.510
I don't know.

02:25.086 --> 02:26.387
Oh.

02:28.590 --> 02:30.475
Because I was thinking...

02:31.801 --> 02:33.821
maybe if you did come back,

02:33.845 --> 02:37.190
uh, got back into your routine,

02:37.390 --> 02:39.776
you might start feeling
like your old self again.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.738
And maybe we'd start
feeling like us again.

02:44.856 --> 02:47.075
Maybe it's as easy as that.

02:48.193 --> 02:49.420
Yeah...

02:49.444 --> 02:50.787
maybe.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.179
Give me hand, will you?

03:40.203 --> 03:42.922
She's just sitting there in
the living room, Charlie.

03:43.206 --> 03:44.183
Who?

03:44.207 --> 03:45.434
Julia.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.270
She's been watching infomercials
since, like, 4:00 this morning.

03:48.294 --> 03:51.556
I said "Hi", but it's like
she didn't even hear me.

03:53.675 --> 03:55.726
Is she gonna be okay?

03:57.220 --> 03:59.814
Yeah, Claud... she's
gonna be all right.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.365
Been up since four, huh?

04:09.440 --> 04:12.910
Yeah. I, uh... couldn't sleep.

04:22.245 --> 04:24.338
Something's got to
give here, Jule.

04:24.956 --> 04:26.475
You've spent the last
week watching shadows

04:26.499 --> 04:28.009
move across the walls.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.387
Don't you think it's time
to go back to school?

04:31.671 --> 04:33.556
Maybe next week.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.349
I just...

04:35.383 --> 04:37.393
I don't feel ready yet.

04:39.679 --> 04:42.064
Don't make me go back, Charlie.

04:42.473 --> 04:44.734
Look, I don't want
to be a hard-ass.

04:44.976 --> 04:46.203
If I thought staying
home is helping,

04:46.227 --> 04:48.321
I'd be all for it, but it's not.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.666
Obviously it's not.
So I'm sorry.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.992
But I'm gonna... I'm not gonna
write you any more notes.

04:55.945 --> 04:58.247
I think you should go on
upstairs and get dressed.

05:04.662 --> 05:06.765
So... five days, huh?

05:06.789 --> 05:07.965
Mm-hm.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.394
Five days is a long time.

05:10.418 --> 05:13.054
Five days is gonna seriously
bring down our average.

05:14.547 --> 05:18.059
Is that your way of saying
you're gonna miss me?

05:18.509 --> 05:19.685
Yeah.

05:21.095 --> 05:22.605
Sure.

05:23.014 --> 05:24.116
Vertically...

05:24.140 --> 05:25.358
or horizontally?

05:26.434 --> 05:27.578
Well...

05:27.602 --> 05:29.028
you know, both.

05:35.026 --> 05:36.452
You know what?

05:36.653 --> 05:38.746
Hell with the
affiliates' meeting.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.706
How does Hawaii sound?

05:41.407 --> 05:42.426
What? Hawaii?

05:42.450 --> 05:43.594
Mm-hm.

05:43.618 --> 05:47.255
Five days, just the two of us,
on some incredible beach.

05:47.497 --> 05:50.633
We can spend some real time
together for a change.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.311
Haven't we been doing that?

05:52.335 --> 05:53.604
Uh, no.

05:53.628 --> 05:56.899
It's been a "How fast can you
be at my place" kind of time.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.724
Let's really go away together.

05:59.550 --> 06:01.695
Kathleen, you can't just
blow off your meeting.

06:01.719 --> 06:02.988
Why can't I?

06:03.012 --> 06:05.699
It's 2000 people in a room.

06:05.723 --> 06:07.900
They won't even
notice I'm not there.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.165
We'll book a suite at
the Haleakala Resort.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.042
We'll tell 'em we're
honeymooners.

06:15.066 --> 06:16.877
Newlyweds always get upgrades.

06:16.901 --> 06:17.962
Uh, Kathleen...

06:17.986 --> 06:20.255
They'll probably give us one of
those private little bungalows.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.924
I'm just gonna call my
travel agent and see.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.083
I can't go away
with you, Kathleen.

06:24.659 --> 06:27.712
I've got, you know, the kids.

06:27.745 --> 06:29.974
Especially this week,
with Jake not being here.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.382
The kids?

06:31.958 --> 06:33.259
Yeah.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.595
Among other things, I've
got responsibilities.

06:37.922 --> 06:39.066
Like?

06:39.090 --> 06:40.599
Like...

06:41.175 --> 06:43.696
Like... responsibilities, okay?

06:43.720 --> 06:46.439
They need me around in
case stuff happens...

06:46.556 --> 06:47.616
or breaks.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.659
Or they need something.

06:48.683 --> 06:50.693
Or they get in trouble.

06:51.185 --> 06:53.070
In case stuff breaks?

06:53.771 --> 06:56.291
Hey, Kathleen, I know this
might be a foreign concept,

06:56.315 --> 06:59.785
but I've got a lot of people to think
about other than myself, okay?

07:02.363 --> 07:04.832
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

07:08.327 --> 07:12.048
It just sounds confusing because
you missed the Potsdam stuff.

07:12.457 --> 07:14.601
Once you do the reading
you'll be totally okay.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.093
They're staring at me.

07:17.295 --> 07:18.679
Who is?

07:18.755 --> 07:20.598
Those girls over there.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.154
That's because you're wearing
the same shirt as one of them.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.572
That's all they were saying.

07:26.596 --> 07:28.490
Oh. Oh, I thought, um...

07:28.514 --> 07:29.700
They don't know.

07:29.724 --> 07:31.275
Nobody knows.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.319
And even if they did, so what?

07:35.813 --> 07:37.865
Look, you're doing great.

07:38.232 --> 07:40.910
Just gotta make it through
one more class, that's it.

07:52.163 --> 07:55.174
We should probably go in, if you
want to get seats together.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.886
No. Uh, I'm not
taking last period.

07:59.253 --> 08:00.856
You're... Why not?

08:00.880 --> 08:01.982
Um...

08:02.006 --> 08:03.442
because Charlie said not to.

08:03.466 --> 08:06.977
He told me to skip
last class because...

08:07.345 --> 08:08.896
we're going away.

08:09.931 --> 08:11.283
You're going away where?

08:11.307 --> 08:12.534
To Tahoe...

08:12.558 --> 08:14.110
for the weekend.

08:14.644 --> 08:15.871
You didn't tell me this.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.164
I didn't? I thought I did.

08:17.188 --> 08:18.374
No, you didn't.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.615
Oh.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.283
Sorry.

08:22.151 --> 08:24.829
Charlie thought it would be a
good idea for me to get away.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.509
Anyways... go ahead.

08:28.533 --> 08:29.718
I'll call when I get back.

08:29.742 --> 08:31.512
Uh, can we talk
while you're gone.

08:31.536 --> 08:33.087
No. There's no phone.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.715
Take good notes, okay?

08:38.583 --> 08:39.561
Tahoe?

08:39.585 --> 08:41.855
Yeah, with Justin's family.

08:41.879 --> 08:42.981
I don't know, Jule, do you...

08:43.005 --> 08:44.149
You sure you feel up for that?

08:44.173 --> 08:47.977
Yeah. Justin's gonna catch me
up on some history I missed.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.324
I think you're right
about getting out.

08:52.348 --> 08:54.150
I think it was good for me.

08:55.184 --> 08:56.787
And I think this will...

08:56.811 --> 08:58.863
it'll just be that much better.

08:59.522 --> 09:00.582
Okay.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.116
Well, if you're sure.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.410
Thanks.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.436
Check this out, I'm
in the bathroom,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.646
and this guy says the only
reason he comes to hear

09:22.670 --> 09:24.305
this band is because of Sarah.

09:24.589 --> 09:26.015
Yep.

09:26.716 --> 09:28.350
That's my girl.

09:32.263 --> 09:34.106
- So who's coming to the party?
 -Hm?

09:35.850 --> 09:37.777
The leap year thing.
Who's coming?

09:39.353 --> 09:40.738
Uh...

09:42.148 --> 09:43.625
You know, people, you.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.075
Some other people.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.456
Her.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.469
Man, what a great idea.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.512
A party every four years.

09:55.536 --> 09:56.796
Yeah.

10:19.477 --> 10:20.861
Oh, God.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.332
Did we have a date?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.791
No, no. We didn't have a date.

10:24.815 --> 10:27.368
I'm... I'm just dropping by.

10:28.069 --> 10:29.829
Is it bad timing?

10:29.987 --> 10:31.465
No. But, um...

10:31.489 --> 10:34.208
But I've never
dropped by before.

10:34.325 --> 10:35.302
Well, yeah.

10:35.326 --> 10:36.752
I know.

10:37.286 --> 10:38.639
Don't you think that's
a little strange,

10:38.663 --> 10:40.589
one month into a relationship?

10:41.791 --> 10:43.425
No.

10:43.459 --> 10:45.729
I mean, your place
is much cooler.

10:45.753 --> 10:48.222
And, uh, besides, no kids.

10:49.298 --> 10:52.110
Um, look, I thought about
what you said earlier.

10:52.134 --> 10:56.063
And, you know, you have this
whole half of your life that...

10:56.514 --> 10:57.741
I never see.

10:57.765 --> 11:00.901
I mean, that I actually
avoid being part of.

11:01.352 --> 11:03.247
I mean, you have a family
I don't even know.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.572
Why is that?

11:05.398 --> 11:06.959
Because they're
incredibly annoying?

11:06.983 --> 11:08.460
I'm being serious.

11:08.484 --> 11:09.702
You know, it's...

11:10.486 --> 11:11.954
Jeez!

11:13.906 --> 11:16.176
I mean who, who made
the stupid decision

11:16.200 --> 11:19.753
that you and me were only about,
you know, going to dinner or...

11:20.705 --> 11:24.049
fooling around in the
afternoon, or taking weekends?

11:24.542 --> 11:26.979
I feel like maybe it's my fault.

11:27.003 --> 11:28.855
Hey, no. No.

11:28.879 --> 11:30.357
It's no one's fault.

11:30.381 --> 11:33.360
I don't want to be just
a diversion for you.

11:33.384 --> 11:34.987
I want to be a
part of your life.

11:35.011 --> 11:37.322
And if that means hanging
out with the kids

11:37.346 --> 11:40.409
and eating leftovers
over the sink then...

11:40.433 --> 11:42.443
Let's not glamorize this.

11:44.353 --> 11:46.488
I wanna be a part of your life.

11:48.899 --> 11:50.451
This looks good.

11:50.484 --> 11:53.088
<i>This is the final boarding
call for flight...</i>

11:53.112 --> 11:54.423
Hi. Can I help you?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.216
Yeah. Hi. Um...

11:56.240 --> 11:59.636
I'd like to buy a ticket on the
next flight to New Orleans, please.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.587
Okay.

12:01.912 --> 12:03.631
Let's see.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.186
Uh, that's a wide-open flight...

12:08.210 --> 12:11.064
leaving at ten o'clock
from gate seven.

12:11.088 --> 12:12.389
Okay.

12:21.182 --> 12:22.399
Mm-hm.

12:22.725 --> 12:25.235
Are they in classes all day?

12:26.270 --> 12:28.415
Oh, I see. Uh...

12:28.439 --> 12:30.866
Well, can I leave a
message for him?

12:31.317 --> 12:32.868
Griffin Holbrook.

12:33.444 --> 12:36.789
Yeah, um... tell him
that Julia called.

12:37.531 --> 12:39.134
Actually...

12:39.158 --> 12:41.085
tell him that Julia's here.

12:42.119 --> 12:43.420
Thanks.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.516
Why not?

12:46.540 --> 12:48.717
What objection could
you possibly have?

12:48.793 --> 12:50.354
I'm just not excited
about the thought

12:50.378 --> 12:52.064
of drunk teenagers
puking in our bathtub.

12:52.088 --> 12:54.274
No, Charlie. No one's
gonna be puking anywhere.

12:54.298 --> 12:56.610
Okay? It's just a bunch
of friends hanging out.

12:56.634 --> 12:58.227
No big deal.

12:58.427 --> 12:59.905
I don't know, Bay.

12:59.929 --> 13:02.481
Oh, let him have the party.

13:03.891 --> 13:06.276
Mm. Smells good. What is it?

13:06.477 --> 13:07.903
Um...

13:08.145 --> 13:11.375
<i>huevos ranchitos...</i> Who...

13:11.399 --> 13:13.543
Oh, I'm Kathleen.

13:13.567 --> 13:16.912
But I guess that's stating
the obvious, huh?

13:18.572 --> 13:19.591
Hi.

13:19.615 --> 13:23.043
Um, is this where you're
having the party? Out there?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.170
Um...

13:25.621 --> 13:26.848
No, actually...

13:26.872 --> 13:28.517
actually I was planning
on having it inside.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.894
Listen, I throw a
million parties a year,

13:30.918 --> 13:32.646
so I know whereof I speak.

13:32.670 --> 13:33.730
Get 'em outside,

13:33.754 --> 13:38.350
light candles, and suddenly the
whole party's sexy and mysterious.

13:39.135 --> 13:40.644
Come here. I'll show you.

13:41.178 --> 13:42.646
Okay.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.193
You know, you might want to just
toss in a hint of cilantro.

14:01.949 --> 14:03.667
How did she seem?

14:03.909 --> 14:06.263
She seemed tall.

14:06.287 --> 14:07.264
This one?

14:07.288 --> 14:08.348
Mm. Too hard.

14:08.372 --> 14:11.143
So... what besides tall?

14:11.167 --> 14:12.509
I don't know.

14:12.626 --> 14:14.479
It was weird seeing
somebody other than Kirsten

14:14.503 --> 14:16.388
in Charlie's robe,
that's for sure.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.941
She had cool ideas
about the party.

14:17.965 --> 14:19.141
This one?

14:19.467 --> 14:20.652
You already gave me that one.

14:20.676 --> 14:21.977
Oh.

14:23.179 --> 14:24.281
So, um...

14:24.305 --> 14:26.523
have you thought about what
you're gonna wear tonight?

14:27.183 --> 14:28.650
God, I don't know.

14:29.643 --> 14:30.829
Because, um...

14:30.853 --> 14:32.404
I was thinking that...

14:32.897 --> 14:35.991
I really love that... that
black sweater that you have.

14:37.234 --> 14:38.795
- The turtleneck?
- Yeah.

14:38.819 --> 14:40.412
Mm. It itches.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.090
Well, yeah. But
something like that?

14:42.114 --> 14:43.508
Yeah, probably.

14:43.532 --> 14:46.511
Probably not the dress
you wore last night.

14:46.535 --> 14:47.804
God, no.

14:47.828 --> 14:50.255
Yeah. I didn't think so.

14:50.372 --> 14:51.808
No, I mean, you
know, I'd love to,

14:51.832 --> 14:53.518
but I just haven't had
a chance to wash it.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.135
It's drenched in sweat.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.720
Perfect.

15:01.926 --> 15:03.435
Who is it?

15:03.928 --> 15:05.312
Julia?

15:07.723 --> 15:08.825
Hi.

15:08.849 --> 15:10.035
Whoa. It is you.

15:10.059 --> 15:11.902
Yeah, of course.

15:12.353 --> 15:14.498
I, uh... I told a couple
of the guys about you.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.698
I just... I figured maybe
they were setting me up.

15:16.941 --> 15:18.700
No, it's me.

15:20.277 --> 15:21.755
Yeah, well, wow.

15:21.779 --> 15:24.414
I uh... You look, uh...

15:24.740 --> 15:26.125
not so good.

15:26.534 --> 15:27.918
Are you okay?

15:27.952 --> 15:29.054
Yeah.

15:29.078 --> 15:31.088
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

15:31.372 --> 15:33.423
I'm just, um...

15:33.749 --> 15:37.261
I had a rough... time,
and I haven't...

15:37.503 --> 15:40.722
slept much. But, listen, um...

15:41.173 --> 15:42.724
How are you?

15:42.883 --> 15:44.236
What kind of rough time?

15:44.260 --> 15:45.779
Something bad happen to you?

15:45.803 --> 15:47.104
No.

15:48.931 --> 15:53.819
I mean, something bad, yeah.
But it didn't happen to me.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.489
I did it. Something
really stupid.

16:00.234 --> 16:01.503
What?

16:01.527 --> 16:02.546
You know what, Griffin?

16:02.570 --> 16:05.131
I have spent the last
week doing nothing but...

16:05.155 --> 16:07.467
talking and agonizing and...

16:07.491 --> 16:09.793
crying about this thing.

16:10.494 --> 16:13.672
So... what I really want
right now is to just...

16:14.123 --> 16:16.675
not... yet, okay?

16:17.209 --> 16:18.562
Okay.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.438
I mean, well, sure.

16:20.462 --> 16:23.140
I can't even believe
you're here, so, yeah...

16:23.299 --> 16:24.892
whatever.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.113
Out of chips.

16:38.772 --> 16:41.293
Uh... Sarah rearranged
all this stuff.

16:41.317 --> 16:42.586
Where is she anyway?

16:42.610 --> 16:44.161
She's out there with Matt.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.047
He's here?

16:46.071 --> 16:47.382
Who invited him?

16:47.406 --> 16:50.375
I'm guessing Sarah, when she
asked the rest of the band.

16:51.327 --> 16:53.545
Wait a second. They're all here?

16:53.954 --> 16:56.256
There they are, in
this one over here.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.967
What is she doing on his lap?

16:59.376 --> 17:01.479
Oh, they're... they're doing
this ventriloquist thing.

17:01.503 --> 17:03.096
It's hysterical.

17:03.464 --> 17:05.182
A ventriloquist thing.

17:05.214 --> 17:07.434
Yeah. She's the dummy.
He's the ventriloquist.

17:08.761 --> 17:09.779
On his lap?

17:09.803 --> 17:11.521
Duh. That's what makes it funny.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.368
That's not funny.

17:16.393 --> 17:18.319
Trust me. When you're
out there, it's a riot.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.588
You're folding his laundry?

17:26.612 --> 17:27.672
What can I say?

17:27.695 --> 17:30.082
Love makes you do
ridiculous things.

17:30.324 --> 17:31.551
You're in love?

17:31.575 --> 17:32.677
Really?

17:32.701 --> 17:34.002
Go figure.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.172
Oh... I'm in love too.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.602
His name's Enrico.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.135
And he's Mexican.

17:42.252 --> 17:44.147
That's why I'm learning Spanish.

17:44.171 --> 17:46.306
Ooh! A Latin lover.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.350
Exactly.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.946
Well, it wasn't downstairs.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.113
Where the hell is it?

17:52.137 --> 17:53.198
What's with him?

17:53.222 --> 17:56.326
Stress. Been trying to drag him
to Hawaii, but he won't go.

17:56.350 --> 17:57.243
Kathleen...

17:57.267 --> 17:59.329
What are you, like, loco?
Why not?

17:59.353 --> 18:01.206
He thinks you can't
survive his absence.

18:01.230 --> 18:02.374
What?

18:02.398 --> 18:04.709
When was the last time you
actually solved a problem?

18:04.733 --> 18:07.619
Hey... I do a lot around here.

18:07.778 --> 18:11.091
Maybe not all the obvious stuff, not the...
the glory jobs.

18:11.115 --> 18:13.458
But the nitty-gritty,
behind-the-scenes stuff.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.336
You guys would be
lost without me.

18:18.247 --> 18:20.340
Okay. So I'll take them, too.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.394
What?

18:22.418 --> 18:23.645
Really?

18:23.669 --> 18:25.887
- Mm-hm.
- Claudia, um...

18:26.255 --> 18:28.566
Could go look for my
leather jacket, please?

18:28.590 --> 18:30.267
<i>Si, senor.</i>

18:37.516 --> 18:39.234
What was that?

18:40.394 --> 18:42.237
A very nice invitation?

18:43.063 --> 18:44.207
You have no right...

18:44.231 --> 18:46.867
no right to tell her that
she can go to Hawaii.

18:47.317 --> 18:48.795
Relax, Charlie.

18:48.819 --> 18:50.005
What's the big deal?

18:50.029 --> 18:53.790
The big deal is, is that I don't want
you taking them on family trips.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.461
It's okay. So I'll
rescind the invitation.

18:58.162 --> 18:59.931
And I don't want this.

18:59.955 --> 19:02.466
You, here, folding my laundry.

19:02.791 --> 19:05.969
I mean, God, you, you
put away my socks.

19:07.254 --> 19:10.182
I'm sorry. It was a
terrible thing to do.

19:10.924 --> 19:12.476
Look...

19:13.594 --> 19:15.270
I don't mean that.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.607
Of course, it was... It was a...

19:19.516 --> 19:21.568
A very nice thing to do.

19:22.811 --> 19:24.664
But... what is going on?

19:24.688 --> 19:28.033
When... when did everything
get so involved?

19:29.610 --> 19:32.996
Because this was supposed
to be a casual thing.

19:34.364 --> 19:37.751
Well, things can't stay
casual forever, Charlie.

19:39.787 --> 19:42.214
Uh... I mean, I love you.

19:51.340 --> 19:53.359
How about this one?
Is it flat enough?

19:53.383 --> 19:54.652
Sure.

19:54.676 --> 19:57.655
Hold it like this... and
spin it out of your hand.

19:57.679 --> 19:58.980
Okay.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.067
Damn.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.570
That's all right. There's
more where that came from.

20:11.652 --> 20:13.286
So I guess you got
pregnant, huh?

20:18.075 --> 20:19.501
You could tell?

20:22.955 --> 20:24.714
I just figured.

20:25.207 --> 20:27.426
I mean, what else could it be?

20:27.543 --> 20:28.885
Oh.

20:30.212 --> 20:32.639
Well, I'm not pregnant now.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.143
I lost it.

20:36.635 --> 20:39.688
I mean... a miscarriage.

20:41.765 --> 20:43.066
But...

20:44.768 --> 20:46.987
I almost had an abortion.

20:47.312 --> 20:48.613
Whoa!

20:49.773 --> 20:51.835
Well, are you all right?

20:51.859 --> 20:53.503
I mean, physically?

20:53.527 --> 20:56.121
Yeah. I'm okay.

20:56.238 --> 20:57.497
Good.

21:01.785 --> 21:03.420
Was he cool about it?

21:03.954 --> 21:05.098
Yeah.

21:05.122 --> 21:06.465
Very.

21:12.129 --> 21:13.763
Why are you here?

21:15.257 --> 21:16.808
I don't know.

21:19.136 --> 21:20.530
Maybe...

21:20.554 --> 21:22.939
I thought you'd understand.

21:24.224 --> 21:26.109
This never happened to me.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.570
I mean, with a girl. I...

21:30.189 --> 21:33.867
But you've done things you
wish you could undo, right?

21:35.152 --> 21:36.495
Yeah.

21:36.612 --> 21:37.954
Yeah, lots.

21:39.948 --> 21:41.333
Come on.

21:43.577 --> 21:46.046
It's like I can't
recognize myself.

21:46.914 --> 21:51.144
I mean, the me I know would
never have let this happen,

21:51.168 --> 21:52.552
you know?

21:53.003 --> 21:55.815
The me I know would never
have had an appointment

21:55.839 --> 21:58.099
at an abortion clinic.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.769
Do you know what I mean?

22:01.762 --> 22:03.031
What, are you kidding?

22:03.055 --> 22:04.564
Look at this uniform.

22:05.015 --> 22:08.036
Some days I wake up and
look at it and think,

22:08.060 --> 22:10.278
"Whose life did I
get by mistake?"

22:12.189 --> 22:13.657
So, what do you do?

22:16.318 --> 22:18.537
I put on the clothes.

22:18.862 --> 22:20.247
I mean, they're mine.

22:24.159 --> 22:27.587
You're not... mad at me for
coming to you, are you?

22:31.541 --> 22:33.551
It's not exactly
the easiest thing.

22:36.421 --> 22:37.847
I love you.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.393
Yeah.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.521
Well, if it helps...

22:46.765 --> 22:48.066
Yeah.

22:51.853 --> 22:53.081
Sarah.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.615
- Could I... talk to you a sec?
- Sure.

22:56.858 --> 22:58.535
Hey, is everything okay?

23:00.112 --> 23:02.715
Somebody stole Charlie's
really expensive leather coat.

23:02.739 --> 23:04.592
Oh, my God. God,
who would take it?

23:04.616 --> 23:05.551
I don't know.

23:05.575 --> 23:07.345
I was thinking maybe one
of the guys in the band.

23:07.369 --> 23:09.263
You've only known them,
what, like two months.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.182
Yeah, and long enough to
know they don't steal.

23:11.206 --> 23:12.934
Yeah, well, I think you
should probably ask them.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.936
Bailey, I'm not gonna
confront my friends.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.146
They're not your friends, Sarah.

23:17.170 --> 23:19.524
Your friends would never make
you dance around half-naked

23:19.548 --> 23:21.266
just to draw a crowd for them.

23:22.259 --> 23:23.685
What did you say?

23:26.680 --> 23:28.616
God, Bailey, if you have a
problem with the way I perform,

23:28.640 --> 23:29.909
don't take it out on my friends.

23:29.933 --> 23:31.035
I'm not.

23:31.059 --> 23:33.496
Okay. I'm not. I'm just saying that the
coat is missing. And those guys...

23:33.520 --> 23:35.071
I found it.

23:37.232 --> 23:39.492
He left it in the car. Doofus.

23:52.456 --> 23:53.808
This place sucks.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.842
Yeah, well, it's all
I could afford.

23:59.212 --> 24:00.764
I had a good day.

24:02.215 --> 24:03.933
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

24:06.219 --> 24:07.947
Griffin, I don't
feel comfortable...

24:07.971 --> 24:10.491
Oh, I know. I don't
mean like that.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.734
I... Come on.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.654
I mean, I'm gonna...
stay right over here.

24:16.730 --> 24:20.418
That way maybe you can...
sleep a little easier.

24:20.442 --> 24:22.619
Don't you have a
curfew or something?

24:23.695 --> 24:25.423
Uh... yeah.

24:25.447 --> 24:28.083
It, uh... It was an hour ago.

24:30.285 --> 24:32.472
Griffin, don't get in
trouble over this.

24:32.496 --> 24:34.005
It's not worth it.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.466
Yeah. Well, that's
kind of my call.

24:39.961 --> 24:41.554
Lie down, okay?

25:17.958 --> 25:19.102
Is that better?

25:19.126 --> 25:20.385
Mm hm.

25:38.228 --> 25:39.205
Hey.

25:39.229 --> 25:40.832
Ow. Wait. Ow.

25:40.856 --> 25:42.208
I brought you a paper.

25:42.232 --> 25:43.700
We have it delivered.

25:44.192 --> 25:45.461
And some bagels.

25:45.485 --> 25:46.546
I've eaten.

25:46.570 --> 25:48.246
Maybe for lunch?

25:48.280 --> 25:50.039
What are you doing?

25:50.240 --> 25:53.126
I'm saying I'm sorry...
with props.

25:58.123 --> 25:59.892
You left without saying goodbye.

25:59.916 --> 26:02.061
Yeah, well, I didn't feel
like talking to you.

26:02.085 --> 26:04.304
Yeah. I know.

26:05.630 --> 26:06.566
I was being a jerk.

26:06.590 --> 26:09.392
And what I think happened was...

26:09.676 --> 26:12.363
Was that I was just
expecting this small party.

26:12.387 --> 26:14.532
And so when all those
people started showing up,

26:14.556 --> 26:17.743
and then the jacket was missing, I just...
I just freaked out.

26:17.767 --> 26:19.027
I'll say.

26:21.104 --> 26:22.780
And...

26:23.607 --> 26:25.074
I missed you.

26:26.359 --> 26:28.045
Usually at parties, we...

26:28.069 --> 26:30.798
we hang around together talking about
who's hanging on who and stuff.

26:30.822 --> 26:32.508
And when I looked
for you last night,

26:32.532 --> 26:35.043
you were off messing
around with that Matt guy.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.180
He's a friend, Bailey, period.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.181
I know.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.006
I know. I was wrong.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.352
And, oh. Listen to this.

26:43.376 --> 26:45.062
You know the, um... You
know the new thing

26:45.086 --> 26:48.223
that Charlie's trying out. Salinger's
live music on Sunday nights.

26:48.465 --> 26:52.320
Well... he said that he would
squeeze you in this week,

26:52.344 --> 26:53.446
if you wanted to play.

26:53.470 --> 26:54.572
Sunday? That's tonight.

26:54.596 --> 26:55.489
Yeah.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.815
He said, he'll pay 300 bucks.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.331
Is that supposed to make
everything better or something?

27:03.355 --> 27:04.707
No. No.

27:04.731 --> 27:06.542
But it's a really good thing.

27:06.566 --> 27:07.960
And just because
you're mad at me,

27:07.984 --> 27:10.453
that's no reason to throw away
a great opportunity. So...

27:10.695 --> 27:13.957
So, I'm sorry, and I really
think you should do this.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.129
What time should we be there?

27:30.674 --> 27:31.692
- Charlie.
- Oh.

27:31.716 --> 27:33.236
- I wasn't... - You're
on your way out.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.654
Well, just to exercise class.

27:34.678 --> 27:35.738
It's okay.

27:35.762 --> 27:37.522
No, no, no, no. I'm
happy to bag it.

27:37.639 --> 27:39.867
Besides, I can think of a much
better way to get my heart rate up.

27:39.891 --> 27:41.609
Let's go upstairs, shall we?

27:42.102 --> 27:43.329
Um...

27:43.353 --> 27:44.654
Or not.

27:44.854 --> 27:46.123
Charlie?

27:46.147 --> 27:47.949
Can we... can we sit
down for a second?

27:58.076 --> 28:00.962
I want you to know that I think you're
a really great person, Kathleen.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.307
Okay.

28:03.331 --> 28:05.226
You've been incredibly
good to me.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.510
I mean, really, really generous.

28:08.586 --> 28:11.514
So... I want to be fair.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.777
That stuff you said last night
about us moving forward,

28:14.801 --> 28:16.853
about us not being so casual.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.575
The thing is, Kathleen,
I like casual.

28:21.599 --> 28:22.994
Casual really works for me.

28:23.018 --> 28:25.612
Casual is... is what I
thought we were doing here.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.874
But I don't know.

28:28.898 --> 28:32.201
I guess you're right. We
can't be casual forever.

28:32.777 --> 28:35.131
And if you're not
ready to get serious,

28:35.155 --> 28:37.999
well, that... that
says something.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.845
I mean, I guess
eventually you...

28:40.869 --> 28:43.087
you either fall in
love or you don't.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.926
And I'm guessing
you're in category B.

28:50.795 --> 28:52.221
I'm sorry.

28:54.341 --> 28:55.776
Since you've been
so honest with me,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.737
I thought that I
owed it to you to...

28:57.761 --> 28:59.479
Uh-huh. Well...

29:01.681 --> 29:05.443
Thank you... for being honest.

29:09.689 --> 29:11.491
This place is kind of cool, huh?

29:13.902 --> 29:16.079
Ahh. Um...

29:16.571 --> 29:19.290
If you want to, uh, maybe we
could go hear some jazz later.

29:22.619 --> 29:23.596
You're hating this.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.381
No. Really.

29:26.706 --> 29:28.591
Julia, just tell me.

29:30.085 --> 29:31.970
Okay, I'm hating it.

29:32.754 --> 29:33.898
I'm sorry. I...

29:33.922 --> 29:37.225
I just thought maybe if we
came to do something fun,

29:37.300 --> 29:39.278
you know, maybe you could
forget about the other stuff.

29:39.302 --> 29:41.396
Griffin, it's not your fault.

29:42.222 --> 29:46.693
It's just, like... what am I
doing having fun, you know?

29:46.893 --> 29:47.953
Why shouldn't you?

29:47.977 --> 29:49.320
I don't know.

29:49.646 --> 29:53.918
Whenever I made a mistake before,
I could always... fix it.

29:53.942 --> 29:56.253
But this... there's
no way to undo it.

29:56.277 --> 29:58.506
It's just there... always.

29:58.530 --> 30:01.457
I get a knot in my stomach
when I think about it.

30:01.825 --> 30:03.584
Yeah. I know that feeling.

30:04.119 --> 30:06.004
I used to get drunk
when I did that.

30:08.415 --> 30:11.592
I just want to feel like
I'm still an okay person.

30:12.210 --> 30:15.231
Everyone tells me that I am,
but it doesn't mean anything.

30:15.255 --> 30:17.682
I just look at them and think,
"What the hell do you know?"

30:20.719 --> 30:22.812
Well... Let's go.

30:22.971 --> 30:24.397
Where are we going?

30:24.889 --> 30:26.816
Someplace... else.

30:27.976 --> 30:30.079
You need to tell Charlie to
get a new sink in there.

30:30.103 --> 30:32.707
You can barely wash your face
without drenching yourself.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.917
Is that what you're
wearing tonight?

30:34.941 --> 30:36.325
Yeah.

30:36.609 --> 30:39.004
You don't think something
else would be better?

30:39.028 --> 30:40.923
Well, if I thought something
else would be better,

30:40.947 --> 30:42.133
I'd probably be wearing it.

30:42.157 --> 30:44.584
Sarah. I just...

30:44.868 --> 30:48.629
I just think that maybe you ought to
think about how you present yourself.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.141
Excuse me?

30:50.165 --> 30:52.268
Well... you're, like,
this really sweet person.

30:52.292 --> 30:55.094
And... And when you dress
like that, you don't...

30:55.170 --> 30:56.439
look sweet.

30:56.463 --> 30:57.972
Bailey.

30:58.214 --> 30:59.608
The problem is,
without those songs,

30:59.632 --> 31:01.318
we've got, like, 8
minutes of material.

31:01.342 --> 31:02.862
Wait a minute. What songs?

31:02.886 --> 31:05.897
Bailey said the crowd wouldn't be too
into some of the stuff we played.

31:06.931 --> 31:08.367
God, what is your problem?

31:08.391 --> 31:11.495
Look, I am just making sure
that everything goes well.

31:11.519 --> 31:13.706
For who? You're the only
one freaking out over it.

31:13.730 --> 31:14.999
I'm not freaking out.

31:15.023 --> 31:15.916
Yes, you are.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.543
Don't wear this.
Don't sing that.

31:17.567 --> 31:19.378
I was thinking of having a
glass of water, Bailey.

31:19.402 --> 31:20.296
Is that okay with you?

31:20.320 --> 31:21.839
Yeah. Yeah. That's fine.

31:21.863 --> 31:24.425
Or maybe you'd just rather
spill it all over yourself

31:24.449 --> 31:26.417
and enter a wet T-shirt contest.

31:29.871 --> 31:32.057
You're not trying to
make up for anything.

31:32.081 --> 31:33.809
You're making sure that
I do things your way.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.102
Well, forget it. I'm outta here.

31:35.126 --> 31:37.095
Wait a second. Wait a second.

31:37.212 --> 31:38.564
You're just...
You're gonna leave?

31:38.588 --> 31:41.015
What is Charlie supposed
to do about a band?

31:41.299 --> 31:43.944
I don't know, Bailey. Why don't you
go up there put on a turtleneck

31:43.968 --> 31:45.853
and sing <i>Feelings</i>,
for all I care.

31:53.061 --> 31:54.737
<i>Hola.</i> Salinger's.

31:54.771 --> 31:56.123
Claudia.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.448
Who is this?

31:59.234 --> 32:00.409
Kathleen?

32:01.194 --> 32:03.079
I'm not here. I'm not here.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.716
Um... yeah.

32:05.740 --> 32:07.134
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Hold...

32:07.158 --> 32:08.928
Yeah, wait just a second.
Hold on.

32:08.952 --> 32:11.045
Hold on. Charlie's right here.

32:12.580 --> 32:14.298
She sounds really weird.

32:18.962 --> 32:20.513
Charlie.

32:21.631 --> 32:25.768
I did something... so stupid.

32:26.928 --> 32:30.439
<i>Kathleen. Kathleen!</i>

32:30.807 --> 32:32.483
It's a church.

32:33.059 --> 32:34.443
Yeah.

32:35.937 --> 32:37.363
You go to church?

32:39.148 --> 32:40.960
Well, I kind of have to.

32:40.984 --> 32:43.128
It's, you know, part of the
military school thing.

32:43.152 --> 32:44.453
Mm.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.716
Mom and Dad used to
take us to church.

32:47.740 --> 32:48.916
I hated it.

32:50.076 --> 32:52.211
Yeah. My parents too.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.181
Every Sunday, my Mom and I

32:54.205 --> 32:56.392
would have a huge fight
over wearing a tie.

32:56.416 --> 32:59.719
When I came here, it was like one
more thing I have to do, you know?

33:00.003 --> 33:01.888
Some more punishment. Great.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.350
I don't know.

33:07.927 --> 33:11.355
Just one day, then, I started
to see things differently.

33:14.475 --> 33:16.027
It's like...

33:16.936 --> 33:19.947
I actually started to listen
to what the guy was saying.

33:20.481 --> 33:24.086
And a lot of the stuff, you
know, I could care less about.

33:24.110 --> 33:28.497
But the main stuff, the
overall feelings...

33:30.325 --> 33:32.001
it's cool.

33:33.661 --> 33:37.182
This is the only place
where all of the bad stuff

33:37.206 --> 33:40.593
that I've done, all the
mistakes that I've made...

33:42.378 --> 33:43.846
don't matter.

33:46.799 --> 33:48.476
They matter, but...

33:49.928 --> 33:50.946
It's just...

33:50.970 --> 33:54.148
It doesn't change
what I'm worth...

33:55.433 --> 33:56.692
as a person.

34:00.396 --> 34:02.490
It's like, here I'm...

34:02.523 --> 34:04.242
loved...

34:05.276 --> 34:06.619
no matter what.

34:13.701 --> 34:17.338
My parents would never...
say that to me.

34:19.498 --> 34:22.217
Even if they thought it,
they wouldn't say it.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.768
I guess yours can't either, huh?

34:40.520 --> 34:42.112
Kathleen.

34:42.271 --> 34:43.706
Kathleen, come on.

34:43.731 --> 34:44.750
Come on.

34:44.774 --> 34:46.210
We need to get you up. Come on.

34:46.234 --> 34:47.702
Come on.

34:48.152 --> 34:53.165
Uh, Charlie. Ugh.
I'm so embarrassed.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.678
How many of those
did you take, huh?

34:55.702 --> 34:58.472
I don't know. Um, just...

34:58.496 --> 34:59.556
All right. Come on now.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.058
We gotta get those out
of your stomach, okay?

35:01.082 --> 35:02.476
So we're gonna go
into the bathroom.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.468
- All right?
- Okay.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.738
Did you pay extra for this?

35:14.762 --> 35:16.272
What?

35:16.597 --> 35:18.075
It's a half-eaten lollipop.

35:18.099 --> 35:20.067
Cherry I think.

35:21.519 --> 35:22.862
Whoa, whoa!

35:23.062 --> 35:24.123
What?

35:24.147 --> 35:25.906
Nothing. You just smiled.

35:26.482 --> 35:27.459
I did?

35:27.483 --> 35:30.328
Yeah. And it looked good.

35:33.156 --> 35:34.425
Maybe I'll stay.

35:34.449 --> 35:35.666
It's nice here.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.177
No, it's not.

35:37.201 --> 35:39.503
Music sucks, and the
people talk funny.

35:39.662 --> 35:43.174
Yeah. But it's nice
being with you.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.843
What do you have at that place?
Bunks?

35:46.419 --> 35:49.638
Maybe you can hide
me in your bunk.

35:52.175 --> 35:54.310
You know, you probably
shouldn't joke about that.

35:56.554 --> 35:57.948
No, probably not.

35:57.972 --> 36:01.901
Because, uh... you know,
you got a life back there.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.945
You got, uh...

36:06.731 --> 36:08.866
Well, a lot of
things back there.

36:10.151 --> 36:11.452
Yeah.

36:14.697 --> 36:17.833
Problem is I feel so far
away from them now.

36:18.993 --> 36:23.881
I mean, I don't know if I can feel...
like this back there.

36:26.459 --> 36:28.719
I just think you got to hang
in there and do the time.

36:30.505 --> 36:34.016
You know, because... that's the one
thing you know is gonna change.

36:34.717 --> 36:37.154
I mean, every sucky
day you live,

36:37.178 --> 36:38.822
you're not gonna have
to live it again.

36:38.846 --> 36:41.033
I mean... it's done.

36:41.057 --> 36:43.818
You did it. You know, move on.

36:44.393 --> 36:46.487
Maybe the next one won't suck.

36:46.729 --> 36:48.447
What if it does?

36:49.023 --> 36:50.783
Same philosophy.

36:51.567 --> 36:53.577
Just... do the time.

37:03.704 --> 37:05.714
I'm sorry, Charlie. I...

37:06.124 --> 37:07.800
shouldn't have called you.

37:10.378 --> 37:12.513
You want to tell me
what was going on?

37:13.005 --> 37:14.473
Nothing.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.560
I was confused.

37:18.094 --> 37:21.532
I couldn't sleep, and I think
I took a couple of pills.

37:21.556 --> 37:24.567
But I couldn't remember
if I'd taken them, so...

37:24.976 --> 37:27.445
I took some more, and...

37:28.479 --> 37:30.197
Then it all just...

37:31.107 --> 37:32.616
I, I don't know.

37:32.817 --> 37:33.794
You couldn't sleep?

37:33.818 --> 37:36.120
No. I had a crappy day.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.749
What was it you said? "You either
fall in love or you don't."

37:41.534 --> 37:43.720
Boy, and I thought I scared easily.
But you really...

37:43.744 --> 37:45.430
It's not about getting scared.

37:45.454 --> 37:47.173
Oh, yeah, it is.

37:47.373 --> 37:48.350
You know, I...

37:48.374 --> 37:50.936
I could understand if someone
had mentioned getting married

37:50.960 --> 37:53.053
or moving in together, but...

37:55.506 --> 37:57.808
So what's the rule
here, Charlie, huh?

37:58.551 --> 38:00.362
You'll let me take
care of you and...

38:00.386 --> 38:01.864
and turn your restaurant around.

38:01.888 --> 38:04.190
But I can't get to
know your family?

38:04.724 --> 38:07.327
We can have a quickie in the
afternoon or a one night stand.

38:07.351 --> 38:09.570
Forget about a romantic
week together?

38:11.147 --> 38:13.407
You never even tried
to make this work.

38:13.691 --> 38:14.950
Yeah, I did.

38:15.610 --> 38:16.952
Yeah, I did.

38:20.448 --> 38:23.709
You think it's easy for me
to care about someone else?

38:24.452 --> 38:26.754
To give up control in my life?

38:26.954 --> 38:29.006
To risk getting hurt?

38:29.207 --> 38:31.894
To compromise and
overlook things,

38:31.918 --> 38:34.011
and put up with
someone else's crap?

38:34.587 --> 38:36.847
And you got a lot
of crap, Charlie.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.100
But I was willing
to do it for you.

38:41.510 --> 38:42.404
Kathleen...

38:42.428 --> 38:44.522
It's actually cruel what you do.

38:45.097 --> 38:47.242
You ask people to
care about you.

38:47.266 --> 38:49.703
And when they do, and
when it's your turn...

38:49.727 --> 38:51.028
you bail.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.365
I'm sorry.

38:55.274 --> 38:57.660
"You either fall in
love or you don't."

38:57.944 --> 38:59.495
Roll of the dice.

39:00.196 --> 39:01.622
No way to call it.

39:03.866 --> 39:05.167
God!

39:13.125 --> 39:16.345
<i>Final call for the
8:15 airport shuttle.</i>

39:17.838 --> 39:19.139
Thanks.

39:22.677 --> 39:25.239
<i>The express bus to Baton Rouge
will be leaving in five minutes.</i>

39:25.263 --> 39:26.406
You know...

39:26.430 --> 39:28.691
every day, it gets
a little easier.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.194
You know, some days it's worse.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.664
But, uh...

39:33.688 --> 39:36.240
most days...

39:36.691 --> 39:39.868
Most days... life's
actually pretty good.

39:40.361 --> 39:43.080
All aboard who's going aboard.

39:43.948 --> 39:48.002
<i>All passengers on our Alabama
Express with stops in Montgomery...</i>

40:00.131 --> 40:01.890
Some days it's...

40:04.093 --> 40:05.561
it's amazing.

40:31.787 --> 40:33.422
Ah. Thanks.

40:36.751 --> 40:37.968
Hey.

40:39.962 --> 40:41.732
Thought you were
afraid of motorcycles.

40:41.756 --> 40:43.599
I was. Now I'm not.

40:43.799 --> 40:44.901
Was that Matt?

40:44.925 --> 40:47.227
No, that was Evie, the
drummer's sister.

40:47.887 --> 40:48.989
Is that her jacket?

40:49.013 --> 40:51.241
It's mine. You want
to see a receipt?

40:51.265 --> 40:52.826
Hey, why do you
have to be so cold?

40:52.850 --> 40:54.411
No, why do you have
to be so judgmental?

40:54.435 --> 40:55.620
I'm not.

40:55.644 --> 40:58.290
I'm not. I'm just...
I'm just trying to...

40:58.314 --> 41:01.825
I'm trying to find you,
is what I'm trying to do.

41:01.859 --> 41:03.086
Well, here I am.

41:03.110 --> 41:04.963
No, I know. But
it's not "you" you.

41:04.987 --> 41:06.455
It's... You're different.

41:06.989 --> 41:08.425
It started when you
hooked up with the band.

41:08.449 --> 41:11.053
When you guys would sing,
you'd, like, cop this attitude.

41:11.077 --> 41:13.513
And, now it's like you're a
completely different person,

41:13.537 --> 41:14.639
all the time.

41:14.663 --> 41:16.224
I'm 16, Bailey.

41:16.248 --> 41:17.851
I'm still finding out who I am.

41:17.875 --> 41:21.104
And maybe... maybe who you're
seeing, maybe that's the real me.

41:21.128 --> 41:24.431
Well... she's not the you
that I fell in love with.

41:26.175 --> 41:28.403
Which, which means what?
That if I change,

41:28.427 --> 41:29.780
you're not gonna
love me anymore?

41:29.804 --> 41:31.563
That's not what I said.

41:32.473 --> 41:34.743
Because I might change, Bailey.

41:34.767 --> 41:36.286
But that should be a good thing.

41:36.310 --> 41:38.413
And if being with you means
that I can't change,

41:38.437 --> 41:39.998
then there's something
wrong with being with you,

41:40.022 --> 41:41.782
not something wrong
with changing.

41:52.660 --> 41:54.420
Wait, I'll come with you.

42:03.754 --> 42:04.930
Evening.

42:08.843 --> 42:10.144
Wow.

42:10.219 --> 42:11.895
Just what I always wanted.

42:13.347 --> 42:14.741
Was there snow there?

42:14.765 --> 42:16.859
Yeah. Lots.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.902
Man, you must have
been pretty cold.

42:19.979 --> 42:22.999
<i>Julia.</i> Carlos says,

42:23.023 --> 42:28.296
<i>"Que la</i> next time <i>usted vaya</i>
away, leave <i>uno numero."</i>

42:28.320 --> 42:29.663
What?

42:30.281 --> 42:33.167
Charlie said, "Next time you
go away, leave a number."

42:33.242 --> 42:34.918
<i>Exactamundo.</i>

42:39.039 --> 42:41.258
So I guess you went
somewhere else?

42:45.629 --> 42:46.847
Yeah.

42:47.339 --> 42:48.682
Where did you get this?

42:49.717 --> 42:51.393
The airport.

42:52.261 --> 42:55.189
They sell Tahoe stuff at the airport.
I never noticed that.

42:56.682 --> 42:58.400
You want to know where I was?

42:59.435 --> 43:00.829
Are you better?

43:00.853 --> 43:02.529
I mean, are you okay?

43:05.024 --> 43:06.325
Yeah.

43:08.444 --> 43:10.329
Then, no.

43:13.073 --> 43:15.334
Probably don't need
to know, right?

43:18.204 --> 43:20.464
Anyway, you're home, so...

43:20.748 --> 43:22.549
I'll help you unpack.
