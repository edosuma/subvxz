00:09.217 --> 00:10.510
Hey, babe.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.892
Nice to see you too.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

01:01.402 --> 01:02.821
Honey?

01:02.988 --> 01:04.989
Are you okay?

01:11.956 --> 01:13.374
No!

01:25.638 --> 01:27.975
You expect me to believe you're CDC?

01:30.519 --> 01:32.564
- Excuse me?
- Just that you're a day early.

01:32.731 --> 01:35.859
First time I haven't sat on my ass
waiting for you people.

01:36.026 --> 01:38.863
New administration.
A change you can believe in.

01:40.489 --> 01:41.949
Right.

01:47.122 --> 01:48.457
Meet Xavier.

01:48.624 --> 01:52.378
Date of birth: April 3rd, 1984.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.506
I know. I ran the DNA twice.

01:55.673 --> 01:56.966
That's definitely him.

01:57.843 --> 02:00.471
Well, he wasn't big on the sunscreen,
huh?

02:01.013 --> 02:02.139
So, what's your theory?

02:02.306 --> 02:08.229
All I know is, decedent's male,
25 years old, and he died of old age.

02:15.196 --> 02:17.699
You were right about this one.
It's definitely a job.

02:17.866 --> 02:19.409
Thought so.

02:19.576 --> 02:20.953
Any other stiffs in town?

02:21.119 --> 02:22.413
No, just the one body.

02:22.580 --> 02:23.623
<i>Anything else?</i>

02:23.790 --> 02:26.251
Couple missing persons.
Usual for a town this size.

02:26.417 --> 02:27.502
Well, check them out.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.088
<i>You think they're connected?</i>

02:29.255 --> 02:30.798
<i>- Call it a hunch.
- You got it.</i>

02:31.298 --> 02:33.092
And by the way, how are you doing?

02:34.010 --> 02:35.220
<i>- Doing?
- Yeah.</i>

02:35.387 --> 02:37.097
You know, just in general.

02:37.472 --> 02:39.224
Oh, you mean my legs.

02:39.391 --> 02:44.230
Well, I'm just weeping
in my HÃ¤agen-Dazs, idiot.

02:55.076 --> 02:57.537
That's the most recent.

03:00.165 --> 03:01.667
How long has he been missing?

03:01.834 --> 03:04.628
I knew right away when he didn't
come home Tuesday night.

03:04.921 --> 03:06.715
Is there someplace he likes to go?

03:06.882 --> 03:08.842
After work, maybe? A favorite bar?

03:09.009 --> 03:12.054
No.
Tuesdays, he always works a bit late...

03:12.221 --> 03:15.683
...but he always comes straight home.

03:16.183 --> 03:17.978
May I use your facilities, ma'am?

03:39.502 --> 03:41.671
Working late my ass.

03:42.465 --> 03:45.134
At least he's consistent.
Same room every Tuesday.

03:45.301 --> 03:46.344
Hourly rates.

03:46.510 --> 03:48.680
Hope I got that kind of kick
when I'm his age.

03:48.847 --> 03:51.141
Yeah.
Like either of us will live that long.

03:51.308 --> 03:52.476
True.

03:52.643 --> 03:55.396
So, what do you think's in there?

03:55.563 --> 03:57.857
Wrinkly, gooey corpse.

04:08.620 --> 04:11.164
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

04:12.667 --> 04:13.834
Hey. What the...?

04:15.044 --> 04:17.046
- Oh.
- God.

04:17.547 --> 04:18.798
It's gooey.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.051
Sorry.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.554
- Got the wrong room.
- Close the door.

04:24.096 --> 04:25.682
Hey.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.435
Nice tattoo.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.483
Happen to know anybody
named Cliff Whitlow?

04:35.067 --> 04:37.737
- Never heard of him.
- That's weird...

04:37.904 --> 04:40.615
...because you're carrying his wallet.

04:43.869 --> 04:45.329
Huh.

04:45.913 --> 04:49.375
Your wife told us
about your birthmark there. That's nice.

04:49.543 --> 04:52.671
Well, you look great, Cliff.
Did you get some work done?

04:56.134 --> 04:58.344
Could you give us some privacy?

05:02.766 --> 05:06.478
Thanks. Take care. Thanks.

05:06.645 --> 05:08.481
- Please don't tell my wife.
- Slow down.

05:08.648 --> 05:11.651
As far as she knows, I'm dead.
Let's keep it that way.

05:11.818 --> 05:14.947
- How can you possibly be Cliff Whitlow?
- I can't tell you.

05:15.323 --> 05:17.783
- Either you tell us or we tell the missus.
- Okay!

05:18.159 --> 05:19.535
It was a game.

05:19.702 --> 05:21.455
Like Xbox?

05:22.539 --> 05:23.999
What's Xbox?

05:24.166 --> 05:26.293
No. Poker. High stakes.

05:26.461 --> 05:28.630
Instead of cash, you play for years.

05:29.213 --> 05:31.841
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I know it sounds crazy.

05:32.008 --> 05:34.303
Guy comes up to me at a bar,
invites me to play.

05:34.470 --> 05:36.722
Gives me 25
of these weirdo poker chips, right?

05:36.889 --> 05:41.436
Chants some mumbo humbo over them,
says now they're 25 years.

05:41.603 --> 05:44.899
I'm laughing,
but then I come out up...

05:45.066 --> 05:47.068
...and look at me.
- What was he chanting?

05:47.235 --> 05:50.863
How should I know? All I know is, my
hip's good, I threw away my glasses...

05:51.240 --> 05:54.534
...one of those ladies was here for free.
Man's some miracle worker.

05:54.701 --> 05:57.330
- What does this miracle worker look like?
- Just a guy.

05:57.497 --> 06:01.668
Maybe 35, brown hair. Irish accent.
His name was Patrick.

06:01.834 --> 06:04.129
- Where's this game at?
- He likes to keep moving.

06:04.505 --> 06:08.050
Never stays in one bar long,
and he finds you.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.222
Thank you, Cliff.

06:12.389 --> 06:13.974
All right.

06:15.768 --> 06:17.436
Oh, and, uh...

06:18.229 --> 06:20.106
...stay classy.

06:23.318 --> 06:26.238
<i>- That sounds crazy, right?
- No, there's lore on it.</i>

06:26.405 --> 06:28.157
Goes back centuries.

06:28.324 --> 06:32.620
Traveling card player, pops into town.
Beat him, you get your best years back.

06:32.787 --> 06:34.498
Of course, most folks lose.

06:34.665 --> 06:36.458
That would explain
the crunchy corpse.

06:36.625 --> 06:40.630
Supposedly this player's a hell of a card
shark, got a lot of years in the bank.

06:41.006 --> 06:42.424
<i>Find the bar he's working in?</i>

06:42.591 --> 06:44.801
A lot of dives in town.
We have to split up.

06:44.968 --> 06:47.305
Well, why you still talking to me?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.863
<i>- Find anything?
- Yeah, a whole bunch of squat. You?</i>

07:02.030 --> 07:03.698
<i>No, not a thing.</i>

07:03.865 --> 07:07.620
All right, well, you come up dry,
circle back to the motel in 2.

07:07.786 --> 07:08.996
Your turn to grab dinner.

07:09.163 --> 07:12.000
<i>- Usual?
- Extra bacon.</i>

07:12.751 --> 07:15.337
- Can I get a beer?
- Yep.

07:16.421 --> 07:19.884
You wouldn't happen to know of a poker
game going on in back, would you?

07:20.718 --> 07:23.262
It's a bar, not a casino.

07:25.307 --> 07:28.393
My friend Ben told me you'd know.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.563
- Don't know any Ben.
- Sure you do.

07:30.730 --> 07:34.817
You know, balding, smart-ass,
real ladies' man?

07:35.109 --> 07:38.447
Listen, pal, I told you,
I don't know any Ben.

07:38.614 --> 07:40.407
I don't know nothing about a game.

07:40.574 --> 07:42.577
You sure?

07:44.037 --> 07:46.248
Because he sure seems to know you.

07:49.752 --> 07:52.713
<i>Round back, take the elevator down.</i>

07:58.136 --> 07:59.471
Bobby?

08:00.556 --> 08:03.685
- What are you doing here?
- Planting daisies. What's it look like?

08:03.977 --> 08:05.687
Came in on the case.

08:05.853 --> 08:06.981
And you beat me here?

08:07.398 --> 08:10.359
Brains trumps legs, apparently.

08:10.943 --> 08:12.862
- So you found the game?
- Yup.

08:13.029 --> 08:14.823
Did you stop it?

08:14.990 --> 08:16.741
Bobby?

08:21.998 --> 08:23.040
Not exactly.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.752
What did you do?

08:25.919 --> 08:27.379
I played, okay?

08:31.133 --> 08:32.802
And?

08:32.969 --> 08:35.054
I lost.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.684
Are you kidding me?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.145
You played some he-witch?

08:42.313 --> 08:43.940
Don't you take that tone with me.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.735
- You idiot.
- They're my years, I can do what I want.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.403
How many did you lose?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.241
Twenty-five.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.460
We're not done.

09:03.755 --> 09:05.632
You're saying
that you're a mind reader?

09:05.798 --> 09:07.842
Oh, come on, no such thing...

09:08.009 --> 09:11.180
...but I can read people.

09:11.513 --> 09:13.891
Take your lovely companion here.

09:14.643 --> 09:19.022
I'd say judging from her exquisite
posture, she used to be a dancer.

09:20.650 --> 09:22.151
Not much of a drinker...

09:22.902 --> 09:24.195
...very independent...

09:26.823 --> 09:29.743
...looking for adventure.

09:30.911 --> 09:31.954
Hey, man.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.456
Excuse me.

09:33.623 --> 09:35.208
Can I borrow you for a sec?

09:37.543 --> 09:41.006
Oh, yeah. Of course, great.
Good to see you.

09:41.924 --> 09:43.968
Would you two please excuse me?

09:47.097 --> 09:50.141
Sorry to cut you short with
Mr. and Mrs. Easy-Marks over there.

09:50.308 --> 09:53.062
Oh, no big. Wasn't a total loss.

09:55.731 --> 09:59.695
Look, I don't know what it is you think
I did to your wife or girlfriend...

09:59.861 --> 10:01.071
...mother or sister...

10:01.238 --> 10:04.075
...but I just want you to know
my feelings were real.

10:04.242 --> 10:07.745
That ain't my problem, man-witch.
You owe my friend some years.

10:07.912 --> 10:10.207
Oh, that's what this is.

10:10.708 --> 10:13.502
I'm sorry, he lost. Them's the breaks.

10:13.669 --> 10:14.962
Well, then un-lose him.

10:19.175 --> 10:23.180
Oh, go ahead and shoot me,
if it makes you feel better.

10:23.347 --> 10:28.270
Besides, I could use a good,
you know, tickle.

10:30.606 --> 10:33.150
You want years? Great.

10:33.317 --> 10:35.445
- Play me for them.
- Fine.

10:35.612 --> 10:37.030
Dean, no.

10:37.196 --> 10:39.824
They're my years,
I can do what I want.

10:41.744 --> 10:42.953
Lozenge?

10:44.622 --> 10:46.498
What? It's barely linty.

10:47.876 --> 10:51.087
- Okay, suit yourself. Just trying to help.
- All right, all right.

10:51.254 --> 10:52.840
Come on. Let's do this.

10:53.215 --> 10:54.425
You understand the terms?

11:08.691 --> 11:10.401
Buy-in's 25 years.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.073
Make it 50.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.537
I like the cut of your jib.

11:48.405 --> 11:49.572
Twenty-five.

11:49.739 --> 11:51.032
That's 25 years.

11:51.783 --> 11:53.159
They go to him.

11:54.286 --> 11:55.454
- He's cashing out.
- Dean.

11:55.621 --> 11:56.789
Bobby.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.336
- You sure?
- Yes.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.752
That's 25 years you just pissed away.

12:39.297 --> 12:41.841
Better be sure you can win them back.

12:45.929 --> 12:47.056
Shuffle up and deal.

12:51.811 --> 12:54.230
This is gonna be fun.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.655
Hey, Dean?

13:00.821 --> 13:01.989
You find anything?

13:02.156 --> 13:03.909
Oh, you might say that.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.412
Who the hell are you?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.165
Dude, relax.

13:09.332 --> 13:10.375
It's me.

13:12.126 --> 13:13.795
Dean?

13:14.045 --> 13:15.839
Hi.

13:16.006 --> 13:17.424
What the hell happened?

13:17.591 --> 13:20.845
I, you know, found the game.

13:21.262 --> 13:24.099
You... I thought you said
you were good at poker.

13:24.265 --> 13:25.976
I am. Shut up.

13:26.726 --> 13:29.772
So you were just gonna shoot
some old guy? Is that it?

13:29.939 --> 13:32.985
I didn't know what you were.
Have you seen you? You look like...

13:33.151 --> 13:35.779
<i>The old chick in Titanic,
I know, shut up.</i>

13:35.946 --> 13:38.740
I was gonna say Emperor Palpatine.

13:44.038 --> 13:45.833
I see you met John McCain there.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.711
Yeah. Either of you wanna tell me
what happened?

13:48.877 --> 13:50.754
Bobby's an idiot, that's what happened.

13:50.921 --> 13:54.342
- Hey, nobody asked you to play.
- Right, I should have just let you die.

13:54.509 --> 13:57.345
<i>- Nobody asked you to lose.
- It's like Grumpy Old Men.</i>

13:57.512 --> 13:59.181
- Shut up, Sam.
- Shut up, Sam.

13:59.348 --> 14:02.184
What the hell were you thinking?
He's a witch.

14:02.727 --> 14:05.230
He's been playing poker
since guys wore tights.

14:05.397 --> 14:08.317
- You just don't get it.
- Yeah, I get it, Bobby.

14:08.483 --> 14:12.280
You saw a chance to turn the hands
of the clock back, get out of that chair.

14:12.447 --> 14:14.365
Pretty tempting.

14:14.949 --> 14:17.870
- I can imagine.
- No, you can't.

14:18.537 --> 14:19.705
You got me.

14:19.872 --> 14:22.375
I never been paralyzed.
But I'll tell you something.

14:22.542 --> 14:27.213
I've been to hell. There's an archangel
there wanting me to drop the soap.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.717
Look at me.
My junk's rustier than yours.

14:29.884 --> 14:33.137
- You hear me bellyaching, huh?
- Actually, yeah.

14:39.519 --> 14:41.648
I'm having a heart attack.

14:42.065 --> 14:43.107
No, you're not.

14:45.109 --> 14:47.321
- What is it?
- Acid reflux.

14:47.655 --> 14:50.240
Guys your age
can't digest certain foods.

14:50.908 --> 14:54.037
You're gonna need to put down
that cheeseburger.

14:59.377 --> 15:02.129
So you wanna keep emoting...

15:02.296 --> 15:05.592
...or you wanna talk about solving
this little issue of yours?

15:05.759 --> 15:08.053
It's gotta be about the chips.

15:11.933 --> 15:13.309
I slid them across.

15:14.018 --> 15:18.023
Patrick did his little witchy number,
and you prettied up in a hurry.

15:18.190 --> 15:21.026
What are you all thinking?
Some magic chips or something?

15:21.193 --> 15:22.236
Definitely.

15:22.403 --> 15:24.280
- Remember what he chanted?
- Every word.

15:24.447 --> 15:27.409
All right, then let's find out
where he stashes his chips.

15:27.575 --> 15:31.831
And steal me 50, Benjamin Buttons me
back into burger shape.

15:33.374 --> 15:34.458
What do you think?

15:35.126 --> 15:37.295
I think you ought
to put some clothes on.

15:44.637 --> 15:45.972
Ready for housekeeping, sir?

15:48.182 --> 15:49.768
Born ready.

15:49.935 --> 15:52.479
You're just like my grandfather.

15:52.646 --> 15:55.275
He hits on anything that moves too.

15:55.483 --> 15:56.568
You're adorable.

15:56.735 --> 15:59.446
- And dangerous.
- Aw.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.834
Can we just go?

16:33.069 --> 16:36.072
Guys, call somebody.

16:36.238 --> 16:39.534
He ran right out in front of me.
I didn't see him.

16:46.167 --> 16:50.506
- That's my car! Hey!
- I gotta say. I kind of like the guy.

17:31.845 --> 17:32.887
Well, I'm out.

17:44.943 --> 17:46.571
Dean?

19:01.616 --> 19:02.701
Sam?

19:06.122 --> 19:08.249
Dime-store model.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.251
Piece of cake.

19:17.134 --> 19:19.804
<i>It's like Mission: Pathetic. Watch out.</i>

19:27.229 --> 19:28.605
I could have done that.

19:33.153 --> 19:34.946
What are you doing?

19:37.616 --> 19:41.537
- Aren't you the chick from the bar?
- I'm a lot more than that.

19:43.957 --> 19:46.877
It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right.
They're harmless.

19:50.298 --> 19:53.426
You boys want chips? Take them.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.888
They're just chips, Einsteins.

19:56.055 --> 19:57.097
It's showmanship.

19:57.431 --> 20:01.519
This may come as a shock, but the
magic does not lie in a pile of plywood...

20:01.686 --> 20:04.606
...or in any phony abracadabra.

20:05.065 --> 20:08.319
It's in the 900-year-old witch.

20:09.737 --> 20:10.905
You boys want years?

20:11.822 --> 20:13.909
Score them the old-fashioned way.

20:14.076 --> 20:15.285
Texas Hold'em.

20:15.452 --> 20:17.371
Fine, let's do it.

20:22.085 --> 20:23.753
What card am I holding up?

20:26.548 --> 20:27.758
That's what I thought.

20:27.925 --> 20:30.886
If your eyesight's that bad,
what about your memory?

20:31.053 --> 20:33.306
I'm not a murderer.

20:34.682 --> 20:35.975
You, on the other hand.

20:37.102 --> 20:38.562
- No, Sam.
- Dean.

20:38.729 --> 20:40.356
What, Sam not much of a player?

20:43.359 --> 20:45.445
Okay. Well, happy trails, Dean.

20:46.196 --> 20:49.199
Enjoy the twilight of your life.

20:49.783 --> 20:52.286
Should have taken better care
of that ticker, though.

20:56.165 --> 20:58.210
You're free to go.

21:03.508 --> 21:04.634
Oh, but, Sam...

21:05.260 --> 21:09.181
...your brother's situation,
that's punishment enough...

21:09.348 --> 21:13.185
...but I can't let you leave
without a small parting gift.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.776
What are you doing?

21:19.943 --> 21:21.821
You'll find out soon enough.

21:22.947 --> 21:25.116
Get out of here, Sam.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.049
Dude...

21:39.340 --> 21:42.386
...I believe that he-witch gave you
the clap.

21:56.736 --> 21:59.073
A little help here.

22:05.288 --> 22:07.499
You know, I still think I should play.

22:07.665 --> 22:08.833
No.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.126
You're not good enough.

22:10.293 --> 22:12.171
I'm better. Bobby's way better.

22:12.338 --> 22:14.090
- We both lost.
- Exactly.

22:14.256 --> 22:16.510
So what?
So I don't get a say in this anymore?

22:16.676 --> 22:18.095
When you get to be our age...

22:18.261 --> 22:21.431
You're 30, Dean. Look, I've watched you
hustle plenty of poker.

22:21.598 --> 22:24.727
Knowing the game is not enough.
It's not about playing the cards.

22:24.894 --> 22:27.772
- It's about playing the other guy, I know.
- Hooray for you.

22:27.939 --> 22:30.484
All I'm saying is I played this guy.

22:30.651 --> 22:32.653
I know his style. I can take him.

22:32.820 --> 22:35.323
No, Bobby. You don't have enough years
in the bank.

22:35.490 --> 22:37.659
- I got enough.
- You'll die if you lose, Bobby.

22:37.826 --> 22:39.619
So what if I do, huh?

22:39.786 --> 22:43.124
What exactly am I living for, huh?

22:43.290 --> 22:44.834
The damn apocalypse?

22:45.292 --> 22:49.464
Watching men die while I sit in this
chair, can't take a step to help them?

22:49.631 --> 22:53.093
- Bobby...
- No, no. It's the facts.

22:53.803 --> 22:55.722
I'm old...

22:55.888 --> 22:59.267
...and broke down, and I can't...

23:03.063 --> 23:06.401
I ain't a hunter no more.

23:07.235 --> 23:09.320
I'm useless.

23:10.238 --> 23:12.575
And if I wasn't such a coward...

23:12.742 --> 23:16.537
...I'd have stuck a gun in my mouth
day I got home from the hospital.

23:23.378 --> 23:26.424
Bobby, you are not playing again.

23:26.591 --> 23:28.259
I'm not letting you do that.

23:30.011 --> 23:32.514
There's another way out of this.
There's gotta be...

23:32.681 --> 23:34.141
...and I'm gonna find it.

23:48.491 --> 23:50.160
Take it.

23:50.410 --> 23:52.287
It'll help you.

23:57.210 --> 23:59.462
- What is this?
- Most powerful reversal spell...

23:59.629 --> 24:01.673
...you've ever laid your eyes on.

24:01.924 --> 24:03.050
And it reverses what?

24:03.217 --> 24:05.010
Patrick's work. All of it.

24:05.886 --> 24:07.722
You saying I could be normal again?

24:07.889 --> 24:10.517
You and everyone else
he's ever played...

24:11.017 --> 24:12.268
...who's still alive.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.275
- Why the hell should we trust you?
- Trust me, don't trust me, I don't care.

24:18.442 --> 24:19.568
The spell is real.

24:19.736 --> 24:23.281
If it zaps everyone,
don't that include your man?

24:23.615 --> 24:25.283
And me too.

24:25.450 --> 24:26.828
I look good for my age.

24:26.994 --> 24:29.163
Lady, this don't add up for squat.

24:29.831 --> 24:30.998
Why would you want that?

24:31.165 --> 24:33.502
I have my reasons.

24:37.589 --> 24:38.633
Do it quick.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.010
We leave town tomorrow.

25:10.587 --> 25:11.629
Bet.

25:13.882 --> 25:16.802
I sense you've got me by the jewels
on this one, Hesh.

25:19.013 --> 25:20.723
I fold.

25:24.770 --> 25:27.189
What are you up, like,
13 years there, Hesh?

25:28.441 --> 25:30.860
What do you say we call it a day?

25:33.071 --> 25:34.406
Thanks, Patrick.

25:34.573 --> 25:37.951
Hesh here is gonna live
to see his granddaughter's bar mitzvah.

25:38.118 --> 25:39.369
Isn't that right, Hesh?

25:40.580 --> 25:41.706
Thanks again, Patrick.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.333
Shalom, my friend. Shalom.

25:50.716 --> 25:51.759
That was nice of you.

25:52.803 --> 25:53.887
I'm a nice guy.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.182
What can I do you for?

26:04.441 --> 26:05.901
Deal.

26:14.369 --> 26:17.248
Jawbone of a murderer. Great.

26:18.833 --> 26:21.001
You... You know, this really sucks.

26:21.168 --> 26:23.213
How do we even know
her spell's gonna work?

26:23.380 --> 26:25.757
We don't. We ain't got a plan B.

26:25.924 --> 26:28.677
Now, less flapping and more digging.

26:29.011 --> 26:31.639
Oh, God.

26:31.973 --> 26:33.933
My elbows. I'm all creaky.

26:34.517 --> 26:36.061
Hurry up, you crybaby.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.313
Pound it up your ass, Ironsides.

26:39.731 --> 26:42.485
One little grave.

26:43.194 --> 26:44.404
Then you do it.

26:44.571 --> 26:48.075
- Fine, I'll hop right in.
- Well, at least your legs are numb.

26:48.242 --> 26:51.370
- Shut up and dig, Grandma.
- Ow!

26:51.537 --> 26:53.205
Now it's my back.

26:53.372 --> 26:55.250
Can you straighten up?

26:55.417 --> 26:56.960
A little sympathy wouldn't hurt.

26:57.127 --> 26:58.253
Butt cheek tingling?

26:59.212 --> 27:01.257
Well, that's kind of personal.

27:01.424 --> 27:03.342
So yeah?

27:03.718 --> 27:06.388
It's sciatica. You'll live. Keep digging.

27:06.555 --> 27:09.683
You know, Bobby,
killing you is officially on my bucket list.

27:13.146 --> 27:15.064
I like you, Sam. I do.

27:15.231 --> 27:19.069
You're smart and your heart's clearly
in the right place.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.574
I can tell a lot about a guy by looking.

27:25.952 --> 27:28.914
- You mean you're psychic?
- No. That'd be cheating.

27:29.080 --> 27:33.503
I'm talking
about good old-fashioned intuition.

27:34.170 --> 27:35.296
Right. Let's just play.

27:36.297 --> 27:38.175
We are playing.

27:40.844 --> 27:43.306
Does your big brother know
you're here?

27:45.683 --> 27:47.393
Bet five.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.188
Didn't think so.

27:51.774 --> 27:53.609
I raise.

27:54.193 --> 27:56.196
Here you are, right...

27:57.322 --> 28:00.450
...trying to clean up their mess...

28:00.617 --> 28:03.121
...and they still wanna sit you
at the kiddie table.

28:07.458 --> 28:09.711
You're not the little brother anymore,
Sam.

28:10.504 --> 28:12.089
Then again...

28:12.714 --> 28:13.758
...maybe you are.

28:15.176 --> 28:17.262
You're in over your head here, Sam.

28:17.595 --> 28:21.600
I mean, you can keep making
these moves, you know...

28:22.518 --> 28:25.938
...playing it cautious,
playing the percentages...

28:26.273 --> 28:28.608
...but I'll kick your ass
into the nursing home.

28:28.775 --> 28:32.947
Does this armchair psychology routine
usually work for you?

28:33.781 --> 28:34.991
You tell me.

28:35.158 --> 28:37.452
You're the one who's losing.

29:05.443 --> 29:06.486
Little break?

29:09.239 --> 29:11.366
How's it going in there?

29:11.617 --> 29:13.202
How do you think it's going?

29:13.368 --> 29:15.330
What about you?
Have everything you need?

29:15.497 --> 29:18.291
We still need a little he-witch DNA.

29:18.458 --> 29:19.501
He was chewing it.

29:19.793 --> 29:21.044
Hurry up, Dean. Please.

29:21.336 --> 29:25.633
All right.
Just keep him busy and, Sammy...

29:25.925 --> 29:27.928
...don't lose.

30:14.231 --> 30:15.566
Drop it in.

30:25.494 --> 30:27.955
Well, how do I look?

30:30.417 --> 30:32.169
Question.

30:32.919 --> 30:35.506
Is this what you meant
to give your big brother?

30:38.259 --> 30:41.763
The one you gave him
never passed my lips.

30:41.930 --> 30:44.266
Won't do a scrap of good.

30:46.935 --> 30:49.564
I don't like cheating, Sam.

31:03.413 --> 31:05.749
- Argh!
- Stop it, Patrick. Let him go.

31:05.916 --> 31:08.836
- He tried to kill us!
- I did it. I gave him the spell.

31:11.756 --> 31:13.258
What?

31:19.057 --> 31:20.600
Why?

31:20.850 --> 31:23.603
- Why would you do that?
- You know why.

31:26.398 --> 31:28.067
You know.

31:44.753 --> 31:47.422
Keep playing.

31:51.427 --> 31:54.389
Everything we put in that spell
was kosher.

31:54.556 --> 31:57.143
Yeah,
everything except the damn toothpick.

31:57.434 --> 31:59.937
You gotta go get a speck of DNA.

32:00.104 --> 32:01.648
Strap on your track shoes.

32:01.982 --> 32:03.817
Oh, goody.

32:03.984 --> 32:05.402
More stairs.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.326
<i>It's too damn clean in here.</i>

32:12.493 --> 32:15.998
First witch I ever heard of didn't spew
bodily fluids all over the place.

32:16.165 --> 32:18.584
Toothbrush, comb, anything.

32:22.338 --> 32:23.673
Well, look at you.

32:23.840 --> 32:26.635
The percentage player,
betting the farm.

32:26.802 --> 32:28.512
Awful transparent of you, Sam.

32:29.054 --> 32:32.726
I mean, if I had a monster hand
like you have...

32:32.893 --> 32:34.060
...I'd trap you.

32:34.936 --> 32:38.983
But you get so excited,
you bet yourself right out of a big pot.

32:43.196 --> 32:45.073
I fold.

32:45.908 --> 32:48.243
Set of ladies, I'm guessing.

32:59.548 --> 33:01.091
Nice bluff.

33:02.092 --> 33:04.971
If we had time,
I could make a real player out of you.

33:05.430 --> 33:07.140
I got time.

33:08.809 --> 33:10.394
Maybe.

33:10.561 --> 33:13.064
But I can't say the same for Dean.

33:13.314 --> 33:15.692
Your brother's gonna be dead soon...

33:16.068 --> 33:18.487
...and when I say soon, ooh...

33:20.197 --> 33:23.409
...I mean minutes.

33:28.833 --> 33:31.460
The game's not over till I say it is.

33:32.002 --> 33:33.212
Blinds.

33:41.264 --> 33:42.682
Sam.

33:47.771 --> 33:49.857
So when it's about your brother...

33:51.108 --> 33:54.070
...you get emotional,
your brain just flies out the window.

33:54.237 --> 33:56.114
- Good to know.
- Go to hell.

33:59.535 --> 34:01.287
I'm all in.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.669
- Don't do that, Sam.
- I can't leave until it's over?

34:07.836 --> 34:10.505
Fine, it's over.
Now, where's my brother?

34:10.672 --> 34:13.592
- There's poker and then there's suicide.
- Just play the hand.

34:13.759 --> 34:15.636
Dean? Dean, you there?

34:20.266 --> 34:21.643
Fine.

34:23.187 --> 34:24.731
Dean?

34:43.335 --> 34:45.463
I'm sorry, kid.

34:46.672 --> 34:48.175
Aces full.

35:03.442 --> 35:04.693
You're crying.

35:09.491 --> 35:13.079
For a witch, you're so nice,
it's actually kind of creepy.

35:13.871 --> 35:15.581
It's okay.

35:18.125 --> 35:19.378
It was a great hand.

35:22.172 --> 35:23.257
Just...

35:25.301 --> 35:27.387
...not as great as...

35:30.473 --> 35:32.393
As four fours.

35:45.074 --> 35:47.076
Well played.

35:47.368 --> 35:49.245
You know, that whole...

35:49.580 --> 35:51.707
...going-out-of-your-head bit...

35:51.874 --> 35:52.916
Very method.

35:54.751 --> 35:56.963
Well, there's more to you
than meets the eye.

35:57.964 --> 36:00.758
Cash these in for Dean, please?

36:02.845 --> 36:03.929
With pleasure.

36:04.096 --> 36:05.639
Dean, you hear me?

36:07.016 --> 36:09.227
Damn it, Dean!

36:22.284 --> 36:23.952
Idiot.

36:27.790 --> 36:29.292
I can't do this, Lia.

36:29.792 --> 36:30.835
Yes, you can.

36:31.127 --> 36:33.005
Don't make me.

36:34.131 --> 36:35.174
I don't wanna win.

36:40.972 --> 36:43.308
I buried my daughter...

36:43.475 --> 36:45.561
...and she looked like this.

36:47.355 --> 36:48.856
It's not natural.

36:56.365 --> 36:58.076
You knew.

37:00.119 --> 37:02.997
When you decided to come with me...

37:04.500 --> 37:05.960
...this is what you wanted.

37:06.752 --> 37:08.379
You're still young.

37:08.546 --> 37:11.550
You're so beautiful. You have me.

37:11.716 --> 37:13.093
I miss my family.

37:15.220 --> 37:16.430
I'm sorry, Patrick.

37:17.390 --> 37:18.516
I thought you loved me.

37:18.683 --> 37:20.601
I do.

37:21.477 --> 37:23.397
Sweetheart, of course I do.

37:24.731 --> 37:27.276
I thought I was cut out for this,
but I'm not.

37:27.442 --> 37:29.445
I don't think I can do this
without you.

37:29.904 --> 37:33.283
You got on okay for a long time
before you met me.

37:37.371 --> 37:38.914
Check.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.758
All in.

37:59.439 --> 38:01.065
All in.

38:22.673 --> 38:24.593
Thank you.

38:38.234 --> 38:41.820
No tricks? You actually beat the guy?

38:42.572 --> 38:44.407
How the hell...?

38:44.574 --> 38:45.700
Just lucky.

38:47.702 --> 38:50.748
- All right. I'll see y'all guys later.
- Where you going?

38:51.916 --> 38:53.668
Nowhere.

38:56.547 --> 38:59.299
Booster shot. Don't say it.

39:03.429 --> 39:06.934
Well, I guess we can get
the van loaded.

39:10.771 --> 39:13.066
I shouldn't have called you an idiot.

39:13.275 --> 39:15.193
Which time?

39:16.027 --> 39:17.862
I'm sorry.

39:18.238 --> 39:21.868
I mean, I actually... I get it.

39:22.743 --> 39:27.249
Getting old ain't a bachelor party, and
dealing with the crap you gotta deal...

39:27.416 --> 39:30.335
- Don't you go on pity patrol.
- I'm not.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.422
I'm not. I'm just...

39:32.881 --> 39:36.759
- I'm saying, if I was in your shoes...
- You'd never stop complaining.

39:39.722 --> 39:41.473
Fair enough.

39:43.475 --> 39:45.228
You're not useless, Bobby.

39:46.605 --> 39:47.856
Okay.

39:48.023 --> 39:49.190
Good talk.

39:49.357 --> 39:51.444
Whoa, wait a minute. Listen to me.

39:59.453 --> 40:03.041
You don't stop being a soldier
because you got wounded in battle.

40:05.877 --> 40:10.007
Okay? No matter what shape you're in,
bottom line is you're family.

40:10.174 --> 40:14.554
Now, I don't know if you noticed, but
me and Sam, we don't have much left.

40:16.723 --> 40:18.183
I can't do this without you.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.771
I can't.

40:23.022 --> 40:27.152
So don't you dare think
about checking out.

40:27.319 --> 40:28.987
I don't wanna hear that again.

40:35.411 --> 40:37.664
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:40.334 --> 40:41.794
Good.

40:47.759 --> 40:48.927
Thanks.

40:49.511 --> 40:51.264
Are we done feeling our feelings?

40:51.430 --> 40:55.810
Because I'd like to get out of this room
before we both start growing lady parts.

40:56.435 --> 40:58.230
Yeah, we're done.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.621
Let's go, Ironsides.

41:12.788 --> 41:15.499
Oh, that one's sticking, huh?
