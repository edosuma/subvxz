00:47.215 --> 00:48.549
My mama warned me,

00:48.549 --> 00:51.685
no good would come out
of marrying you.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.622
Just look at you.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.528
Stuck in this tin-can with you.
This is my life.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.013
This is my life!

01:03.380 --> 01:06.534
Over, over...

01:06.534 --> 01:09.870
You're just
the same thing every day.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.972
Makes me sick. Know that?

01:11.972 --> 01:13.407
She was right.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.448
You make me sick.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.982
You are nothin' of a man.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.685
What? You're gonna come
over here and be a man now?

01:28.222 --> 01:30.342
Is that what you're gonna do?
I'd like to see you try.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.540
Nothin'.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.975
That's what I thought.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.954
Oh, Jesus Christ, Paul.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.656
What're you doin'?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.993
You look like a fucking creeper.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.730
Why are you standing
over me like that?

02:44.965 --> 02:48.502
Don't even tell me you're on
another all night bender.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.771
Shut up.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.873
Shut up!

02:52.873 --> 02:55.976
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

02:55.976 --> 02:57.645
Shut up!

05:40.073 --> 05:42.876
And thus the voyage

05:42.876 --> 05:45.746
- of the ss ladybug begins.
- Please tell me

05:45.746 --> 05:47.481
you're not doing
what I think you're doing.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.982
And what is that?

05:48.982 --> 05:51.719
Shooting a video
of our road trip...

05:51.719 --> 05:53.821
Without me.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.524
No, I was just getting
a quick shot of ladybug.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.892
Oh, God. You're so weird
about your car, dude.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.061
Do not talk about her
that way, dude.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.964
Whatever.
I'm gonna do the intro.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.232
Hi, everyone.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.501
It's June first, 2014.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.870
And you are about to witness
the super fun,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.540
- and scandalously uncensored...
- Watch it.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.108
Video of our road trip
extravaganza.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.910
I, Kris, will be your host.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.846
And this sexy lady...

06:18.846 --> 06:20.981
- No.
- Yes.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.884
Will be your driver,
miss Shannon Silvers.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.886
- I hate you.
- I love you.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.789
You've already met
our stylish ride, ladybug.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.123
The best car in the world.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.759
The best car in the world,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.226
who we seriously hope
does not break down

06:33.226 --> 06:34.995
ten miles outside
of Los Angeles.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.930
- She won't.
- Yeah...

06:36.930 --> 06:38.799
Um, what else?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.634
Oh. Let me show you something.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.169
Okay.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.772
This is how we're gonna
be spending our evenings.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.206
- What do you think you're doing?
- God.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.776
- Wow.
- Josh!

06:48.776 --> 06:50.578
Wow. You girls
scare way too easy.

06:50.578 --> 06:51.945
That's 'cause
we're girls, dipshit.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.714
Hey, be nice.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.649
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.318
So... scandalously
uncensored, huh?

06:58.318 --> 06:59.887
I didn't know
this was that kind of trip.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.689
Well, it's not.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.157
But Kris has seen one too many
"girls gone wild" videos.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.293
- Hey, a girl can dream, right?
- You know,

07:06.293 --> 07:07.961
I do not wanna know
what you dream about.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.063
I don't really need to know
what Ryan Gosling's

07:10.063 --> 07:12.766
- "o face" looks like.
- It's way more attractive than yours, Josh.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.101
- Don't forget it.
- Oh, yeah?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.069
- How would you know?
- I wouldn't.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.805
Thank God.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.607
Listen, it's just,
it's getting late.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.908
Maybe you guys
should leave tomorrow.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.110
Fuck that,
we can drive in the dark.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.245
It's just that it's safer
if you leave tomorrow.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.847
- You have your whole day...
- Why are you so controlling?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.683
Jeez. You guys.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.620
This is not exactly the fond
farewell I was hoping for.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.788
Well... Whatever.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.989
Hand me your keys. I'll lock up.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.557
You guys can say your good-byes.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.698
How're ya doing?

07:44.698 --> 07:47.234
Good.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.837
Sorry again about last night.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.004
It's okay.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.174
No. It's not okay.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.043
This is our last night
together for a while.

07:56.043 --> 07:59.112
I honestly did not mean
for it to end in a fight.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.580
Yeah, I know.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.118
Just don't understand what's
been going on with us lately.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.756
Look, I told you last night.
You're just being paranoid.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.693
I don't know. Maybe.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.831
Listen, maybe this break's
gonna be good for us.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.999
Take a couple months.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.068
Clear your head.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.003
Yeah. I just don't
wanna lose you.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.271
You won't.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.240
I'm gonna be right here.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.009
Okay.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.414
Hate to interrupt,
but it's that time.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.650
Let's get this debauchery
on the road.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.152
Oh, my God, please don't do
anything Kris tells you to do.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.854
- Screw you, Josh.
- Yeah, screw you, too.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.155
Okay, Jesus. Let's go.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.260
Okay. You two drive safe.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.696
Thanks, dad.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.430
- I mean it.
- Oh, don't worry.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.156
I'll take good care of her.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.335
- I love you.
- Me, too.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.306
Call me when you get to Arizona.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.764
Hey, we can do this.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.999
Yeah.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.401
Shannon...

09:28.401 --> 09:30.070
Mm.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.873
I just feel really bad
leaving things like this.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.743
You guys are gonna be fine.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.911
Besides, you know,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.446
whatever happened, it happened.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.248
You can't change the past.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.350
But you have the chance
to move forward.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.353
Yeah, I know.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.089
- Hey, listen. Hey!
- What?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.324
We are going to laugh.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.860
We are going to dance...

09:52.860 --> 09:54.962
We're gonna sing
at the top of our lungs.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.138
We might even make out
a little bit.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.768
Look at me.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.435
Friends for life, right?

10:04.687 --> 10:05.187
Right.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.376
Okay, let's go.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.510
Let's go!

10:36.403 --> 10:40.140
* she believed in never after

10:40.140 --> 10:43.510
* put her heart
before her pride *

10:43.510 --> 10:47.380
* and if she would be
a long shot *

10:47.380 --> 10:51.084
* maybe she'd be
Princess bride *

10:51.084 --> 10:54.822
* did her hair in curls
and ribbons *

10:54.822 --> 10:57.357
* shadow blue
and lipstick red... *

10:57.357 --> 11:00.060
will you put your phone away?
This is a road trip.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.062
Girl, I am situating
our business.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.263
- Our business?
- Yes.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.932
What is our business?

11:04.932 --> 11:07.000
We can stay with my cousin
in flag for a few days.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.969
- Oh, that's good.
- And she goes to n.A.U.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.171
So we'll probably hit up
some sweet college parties.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.040
Didn't you get enough
of college parties

11:13.040 --> 11:14.541
when you were
actually in college?

11:14.541 --> 11:16.376
Does the pope ever get enough
of wearing those

11:16.376 --> 11:18.946
super baggy,
stiff robes he wears?

11:18.946 --> 11:21.849
I... I don't know.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.050
Exactly.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.584
And...

11:24.584 --> 11:26.954
After flag, we can go wherever

11:26.954 --> 11:29.089
the wind of adventure blows us.

11:29.089 --> 11:32.525
Excellent. I would like
to see yellowstone.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.962
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.399
Isn't yellowstone for like really
emo people that wanna be alone

11:39.399 --> 11:41.168
with their thoughts
and nature and shit?

11:41.168 --> 11:44.905
No, I think you are talking
about Joshua tree.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.506
No, Joshua tree

11:46.506 --> 11:50.043
is definitely where
people go to trip balls.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.478
Where's burning man again?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.513
Oh, my God, I...
How did we get here?

11:53.513 --> 11:55.215
I just wanna see
something pretty

11:55.215 --> 11:58.018
and someone told me
that yellowstone is very pretty.

11:58.018 --> 12:01.154
You know what? I'll give
you your pretty shit,

12:01.154 --> 12:02.555
but it's gonna cost you.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.257
What?

12:05.592 --> 12:06.994
One night in Vegas.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.328
- No.
- Yes.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.629
Say yes.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.164
- Say yes.
- Fine.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.299
Yes.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.902
Yes! Vegas!

12:29.316 --> 12:31.218
Whoo!

12:31.218 --> 12:34.154
Yeah! I'm so glad we did this!

12:34.154 --> 12:35.488
What?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.557
I said, I'm so glad
we finally did this.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.625
Me, too.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.393
What took us so long?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.930
I don't know. Just life.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.597
Ugh, that's a bad excuse.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.568
Okay, well what is your excuse?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.170
Um, you know.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.438
Life.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.640
I knew you were
gonna say that, asshole.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.361
This cannot be
the fastest way to Vegas.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.030
When are we gonna get
back on a freeway?

13:17.030 --> 13:19.299
It said that this
was the scenic route.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.501
I don't...

13:21.501 --> 13:23.503
Well, the only thing
I want to see

13:23.503 --> 13:25.272
are inside of my eyelids.

13:25.272 --> 13:28.008
This is taking forever.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.509
I'm gonna sleep.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.078
All right.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.728
Um...

14:59.432 --> 15:00.733
Come...

15:00.733 --> 15:02.335
Come on.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.132
Okay. Come on.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.371
Ugh, come on, buddy. Come on.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.575
Come on.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.118
Kris. Kris, wake up.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.485
- What?
- Kris, wake up.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.154
- There's someone in the road.
- What is it?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.655
- What?
- There was someone in the road.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.157
- Where?
- She was right there.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.625
She was standing
in the middle of the road.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.261
- Why are we stopped?
- Well, the car died.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.762
But there's a...
There was a little girl.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.831
Ugh, you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.499
It's a kid.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.700
- What?
- I'm gonna go see.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.837
- Shan'.
- I have to go look.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.539
There's nobody out there.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.408
Hello?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.617
Little girl, are you out there?

16:24.617 --> 16:28.188
I have no idea. No.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.723
We're somewhere between
bumfuck nowhere and flagstaff.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.596
Yeah, okay.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.265
Shan', get back
in the fucking car.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.200
There's nobody out there.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.372
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.274
Fucking people.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.318
Anybody out there?

16:58.318 --> 16:59.886
What did they say?

16:59.886 --> 17:02.622
Called triple-a,
they'll be here in a while.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.656
Great...

17:04.656 --> 17:07.527
So what do we do now?

17:07.527 --> 17:10.297
I guess we wait.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.864
Yeah. Whatever.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.168
Who the fuck is that?

17:51.371 --> 17:54.274
Um, either the tow truck driver

17:54.274 --> 17:56.343
or an ax murderer.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.610
You need help?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.250
I'll tell you what.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.752
I'm gonna move my truck up
to where I can tow you.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.487
You girls have until
then to figure out

18:07.487 --> 18:08.955
if you got a better option.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.005
That was really quick.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.608
Talk about service.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.678
Yeah, I happened to be
just up the road.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.846
It's a miracle.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.950
I think you're right.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.699
Uh, yeah, I...
I think I can fix this.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.734
Oh, great.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.470
Can you do that out here?

18:57.470 --> 19:00.673
Um, no. I... I need to
take it back into town.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.578
"Take us back into town"?
Hell no.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.046
What else are we supposed to do?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.848
I'm not going anywhere
with a guy

19:08.848 --> 19:12.319
that looks like he has a suit
of human flesh at home.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.456
- No.
- You're ridiculous.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.699
Look.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.535
Is he a priest?

19:35.342 --> 19:36.743
Is everything all right?

19:36.743 --> 19:39.011
Yeah. Sorry.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.480
You're, a, um...

19:40.480 --> 19:43.550
A priest, and
a tow truck driver?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.885
Now I've seen it all.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.854
Well, I come from a small town.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.623
Everybody has several
responsibilities.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.662
That's great.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.863
Cool.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.845
I'm, uh, Shannon, by the way.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.481
Shannon.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.487
And, do you have a name?

20:20.487 --> 20:22.522
Oh, of course.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.656
It's Terry.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.392
Nice to meet you.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.731
What brings you
and your antisocial friend

20:31.731 --> 20:33.132
to our neighborhood?

20:33.132 --> 20:35.902
Oh, my friend Kris
and I are on a...

20:35.902 --> 20:38.438
Sort of a road trip.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.140
And she has a cousin
that lives in flagstaff.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.709
So...

20:42.709 --> 20:44.444
Almost made it.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.446
You're telling me.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.618
How long do you think
it'll take to fix the car?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.786
I couldn't say
until I take a look.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.688
Tonight?

20:55.688 --> 20:57.590
The shop's closed.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.359
I promise I'll take a look
first thing in the morning.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.503
I know the man who runs
the motel in town.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.071
I'll tell him your situation.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.040
He'll give you a break.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.743
Wow. Small town?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.445
It's not flagstaff,

21:18.445 --> 21:19.946
but once people settle in,

21:19.946 --> 21:22.615
they... they don't usually leave.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.017
Like, something in the water?

21:26.519 --> 21:28.054
Something like that.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.762
Let's see about
getting you guys a room.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.207
It's not exactly Vegas.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.811
I thought you said
you were going to flagstaff.

22:24.811 --> 22:28.648
Uh, we're just gonna go there
for a day as part of the trip.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.783
The city where young
women go to be debased,

22:30.783 --> 22:32.485
and humiliated.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.453
If they're lucky.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.811
Sorry to ruin to your catnap.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.013
Oh, no, no, no, not a bother.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.882
Not a bother.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.617
How can I help you?

23:04.617 --> 23:07.186
These girls
are a bit stranded, uh,

23:07.186 --> 23:10.089
I thought you might offer them
some hospitality.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.525
Oh, anything for you, boss.
You know that.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.561
I'll get 'em all taken care of.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.829
Thank you, Charlie.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.698
You're in good hands.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.600
Swing by the shop
in the morning.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.935
Okay. Good night.
Thanks for everything.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.504
You're welcome. Sleep well.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.075
Well, I'll get you
all settled in then,

23:29.075 --> 23:30.910
just a minute.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.917
Yes, number four.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.954
Well, it ain't much, but the...

23:41.954 --> 23:44.624
The sheets are clean
and the water's hot.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.859
It was uh, Charlie, right?

23:46.859 --> 23:49.729
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hypothetically, Charlie,

23:49.729 --> 23:51.230
if two girls had been driving,

23:51.230 --> 23:53.966
for say, oh,
eight hours before their car

23:53.966 --> 23:56.235
inconveniently broke down,

23:56.235 --> 23:59.572
where might these two
find food around here?

23:59.572 --> 24:02.041
Well, there ain't much
open this time of night.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.877
Uh, mack's...

24:06.846 --> 24:09.682
He doesn't have much, but, uh,

24:09.682 --> 24:11.918
they say the burgers
are to die for.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.352
- Great.
- Okay.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.855
- Y'all have a good night.
- Good night.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.189
Thanks.

24:35.241 --> 24:39.045
- Well, there's a TV.
- Yeah.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.780
The first one.

24:40.780 --> 24:44.283
Like the first one
ever made, ever.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.985
It's for one night.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.355
Don't you even want to know

24:49.355 --> 24:51.858
what I had planned to wear
to the party tonight?

24:51.858 --> 24:54.026
It was hot. It was like...

24:54.026 --> 24:56.395
Kelly lebrock from
"weird science," hot.

24:56.395 --> 24:59.065
It was gonna be cougar town up
in that frat party tonight.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.000
Hello, boys.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.369
Oh, do I go to school here?

25:03.369 --> 25:06.105
No, I'm sorry.
I'm a professional.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.375
But, uh, flattery,
it'll get you everywhere.

25:09.375 --> 25:13.345
Cougar town? Please, you are 25.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.415
You're not even, like,
cougar cub town, yet.

25:16.415 --> 25:17.784
Whatever.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.889
Look, I know this sucks a lot.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.057
It's just for tonight.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.927
Just chalk it up to another
Shannon and Kris adventure.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.195
Right?

25:30.963 --> 25:33.432
You're lucky I like you.

25:33.432 --> 25:36.068
- Oh, you... you like me?
- Kind of.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.738
You like me?

25:38.738 --> 25:41.307
- Oh, I think you love me.
- No.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.209
- I think you do.
- No.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.211
You love me, you do.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.946
I know it, say it!

25:46.946 --> 25:48.447
- Let go of me.
- No!

25:48.447 --> 25:50.850
- Say it right now.
- Say it.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.118
Fine!

25:52.118 --> 25:53.452
I fucking love you, you nerd.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.187
Good.

25:55.187 --> 25:56.856
So, get your ass up.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.058
Let's put on our
finest tank tops,

25:59.058 --> 26:02.028
and go get mack's
famous burgers.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.849
Oh, my God!

26:22.849 --> 26:26.018
- You are such a nerd.
- I know. It's crazy, right?

26:26.018 --> 26:28.454
You don't even play
the video games.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.022
It's different
with your boyfriend.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.475
Why are they staring at us?

26:49.475 --> 26:51.844
I don't know.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.794
Hey, there.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.428
You ladies hungry?

27:19.171 --> 27:22.875
Sorry, is there some kind
of a private event tonight?

27:22.875 --> 27:25.144
Charlie just sent us
over from the motel.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.479
Uh, no, no.
Don't mind those weirdoes.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.817
They're just... ain't used to
seeing new faces around here.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.785
Especially not such pretty ones.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.190
So what'll it be?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.092
I, for one,

27:40.092 --> 27:42.494
will have one of your
mack's famous burgers.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.197
Okay.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.866
Yeah, me too, I guess.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.767
Coming right up.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.907
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.242
- No.
- Yes.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.444
Walk away, girl.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.871
Hello.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.574
Hi.

28:28.574 --> 28:30.376
- Hi.
- What's your name?

28:30.376 --> 28:32.244
Shannon.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.847
- What's your name?
- Emma Jean.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.116
Well, hi, Emma Jean.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.585
Where'd you come from?

28:39.585 --> 28:42.254
Oh, I came from California.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.957
You know where that is?

28:44.957 --> 28:47.259
No.

28:47.259 --> 28:50.262
Hollywood. Disneyland.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.398
No.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.566
Maybe you could
go there some day.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.139
Why not?

29:12.151 --> 29:14.353
Isn't that the reverend
tow truck guy?

29:18.324 --> 29:20.492
You guys met Terry, huh?

29:20.492 --> 29:23.896
He seems like a popular guy.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.465
Yeah, well, that's my
big brother for ya.

29:26.465 --> 29:29.168
Seriously?

29:29.168 --> 29:32.004
One and only.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.572
Hell of a guy.

29:40.012 --> 29:43.415
Hey, I'm tired. Ready to go?

29:43.415 --> 29:44.616
I guess so.

29:46.585 --> 29:50.456
Mack, it has been a pleasure.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.358
Till we meet again.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.692
I look forward to it.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.094
Thanks.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.003
Grill still open?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.082
Not these two.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.602
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.222
Just leave them alone.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.690
You think I have designs
on every traveler

30:24.690 --> 30:26.225
who comes through this town?

30:26.225 --> 30:29.395
I can tell when you see
an opportunity.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.097
You can tell that just
by looking at me?

30:31.097 --> 30:32.364
Huh.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.402
I guess that's what happens
when two people

30:36.402 --> 30:39.038
spend so much time together.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.410
You remember why we're here
in the first place?

30:44.410 --> 30:47.146
Or did that detail
slip your mind?

30:52.018 --> 30:54.386
So, what did you tell them?

30:57.156 --> 30:58.524
Nothing.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.627
That was very kind of you.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.335
You said nothing...

31:09.335 --> 31:12.138
In spite of the fact that I saw
you talking to those girls?

31:13.739 --> 31:15.107
Look, I swear, I...

31:15.107 --> 31:17.776
Do you understand
that it hurts me

31:17.776 --> 31:20.312
when you won't simply
tell me what it is

31:20.312 --> 31:22.448
you spoke to those girls about?

31:27.619 --> 31:30.622
Well, that wasn't so bad.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.991
Yeah.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.329
Hey, you remember
the emergency reserve?

31:37.329 --> 31:38.664
Yes.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.533
I believe this qualifies
as an emergency.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.036
I thought you'd never ask.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.446
* bring a book
a page is nameless *

31:54.446 --> 31:56.315
* like 'em bound
and spoiled and blameless *

31:56.315 --> 32:00.486
* ready for my thoughts
and small cache *

32:00.486 --> 32:02.388
* fill the homes
and sound of music *

32:02.388 --> 32:04.623
* you now how the song
we'll use it *

32:04.623 --> 32:08.127
* every word till now
has been in vain *

32:08.127 --> 32:10.529
* lock the doors
and bolt the windows *

32:10.529 --> 32:12.531
* crack the knuckles,
pop the elbows *

32:12.531 --> 32:15.334
Take away now.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.303
* come on, and make my day now *

32:43.229 --> 32:46.365
Hey, no peeking.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.699
* take away now

32:47.699 --> 32:50.269
* come on, and make my day now *

32:50.269 --> 32:52.871
* take away now,
come on, and make my day now *

32:52.871 --> 32:55.541
am I right?

32:55.541 --> 32:57.709
Wow. That's definitely hot.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.245
It's...

32:59.245 --> 33:01.113
Very hot.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.282
Right? Damn it.

33:03.282 --> 33:06.152
It would have been so epic!

33:06.152 --> 33:08.154
Oh. Okay.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.821
Oh, I'm done with the spinning.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.391
Spinning I'm done with.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.762
Hey, so, mack was totally hot.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.131
Hey, I knew it.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.466
I knew...

33:20.466 --> 33:23.469
You, my friend, are incar...

33:24.803 --> 33:27.173
Incorr... corrigible!

33:27.173 --> 33:28.407
- Shannon...
- Incorrigible.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.741
Small words. Too much wine.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.109
You're dumb.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.285
Whatever. I'd top that.

33:39.285 --> 33:42.288
You talk like a boy.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.822
I am a boy.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.225
Well...

33:58.370 --> 34:00.706
I thought we agreed
no guys on this trip.

34:00.706 --> 34:04.443
No, we agreed
no "Josh" on this trip.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.612
Wow, that's not fair.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.614
Whatever. Move over.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.181
Ow.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.786
Why do you stay with him anyway?

34:15.786 --> 34:17.789
- Because I love him.
- No.

34:17.789 --> 34:21.193
- I do... I love...
- No!

34:21.193 --> 34:24.295
- I love him, Kris.
- No, you don't, Shannon.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.938
Well, he loves me.

34:32.938 --> 34:35.172
That is not the same thing.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.476
Better than the alternative.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.480
Oh, yeah, what's that?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.813
Being old.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.951
Did you hear that?

34:45.951 --> 34:49.288
You can't get out of this
that easy.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.822
No, I heard something.

34:51.822 --> 34:53.391
Shan'.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.860
More drinking,

34:55.860 --> 34:57.629
less... something.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.377
Told ya.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.944
I know I heard something.

35:12.944 --> 35:13.979
Hang on.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.411
I told no! I told you no!

36:02.027 --> 36:04.463
Charlie, please,
you have to listen to me.

36:04.463 --> 36:07.833
- Please? You gotta listen..
- I told you no!

36:34.560 --> 36:37.095
Can I help you with something?

36:37.095 --> 36:38.630
No.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.767
I was just getting
some fresh air and I...

36:41.767 --> 36:44.903
- That I saw someone...
- Saw what, darling?

36:44.903 --> 36:47.506
I thought I saw
someone on the road.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.941
I doubt you saw
anybody out there.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.778
We knock off real early
around here.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.480
Now let's get you
back to your room.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.782
No, that's okay. I got it.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.377
Kris?

37:29.114 --> 37:30.982
Kris?

37:30.982 --> 37:32.551
Kris.

37:33.519 --> 37:36.121
Kris?

37:36.121 --> 37:37.823
Kris, wake up.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.858
Kris, wake up! This isn't funny!

37:39.858 --> 37:41.993
What's with the shaking?

37:41.993 --> 37:45.030
Stop doing that. Go away.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.410
Just another
Shannon and Kris adventure.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.941
Oh, fuck.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.921
Oh, shit.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.231
Kris?

41:09.034 --> 41:11.202
Kris, time to wake up.

41:17.208 --> 41:20.679
I feel like ass, dude.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.715
I know what you mean, dude.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.000
Hey, 'afternoon.
You must be Shannon.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.402
Yeah. Can I help you?

41:44.402 --> 41:46.104
Uh... well, no.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.273
M... my name's pj.
I was sent down by Terry

41:48.273 --> 41:50.275
to let you know
that your car's ready.

41:50.275 --> 41:52.811
It's... is as good as gold.

41:52.811 --> 41:54.780
So whenever you wanna go down.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.148
We'll be down in a few minutes.
Thank you.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.154
Okie doke.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.924
Okay, then.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.799
Wow.

42:13.799 --> 42:17.402
Apparently, it is kosher in kain

42:17.402 --> 42:20.939
to give guest room numbers
to members of the public.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.307
That's awesome.

42:24.409 --> 42:26.778
Are you gonna make it, kid?

42:26.778 --> 42:29.414
Yeah.

42:29.414 --> 42:32.417
I just need a few minutes
to get my life together.

42:32.417 --> 42:33.952
All right.

42:33.952 --> 42:36.154
I'll clean up
and take care of the car.

42:49.801 --> 42:52.137
Oh, hey. That was quick.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.806
Yeah. We gotta hit the road.

42:56.808 --> 42:58.810
I'm sorry. Could you
tell me what time it is?

42:58.810 --> 43:00.178
My phone is dead.

43:00.178 --> 43:03.882
Ah, I think it's just
after 4:00 o'clock.

43:03.882 --> 43:05.383
4:00?

43:05.383 --> 43:07.185
No Jesus fucking way.

43:07.185 --> 43:09.921
- Pardon me?
- I'm sorry.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.256
Never mind.

43:11.256 --> 43:14.392
Um, is Terry around?

43:14.392 --> 43:15.927
No.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.929
He's still out in the truck.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.264
Okay. Uh,

43:19.264 --> 43:21.800
how much do I owe you, I guess?

43:21.800 --> 43:23.701
He left a note.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.239
Girls are all paid up.

43:30.876 --> 43:32.911
No, I don't think so.

43:32.911 --> 43:34.946
I think it's your lucky day.

43:36.481 --> 43:39.184
Yeah, I guess.

43:39.184 --> 43:40.952
Do you know when
Terry will be back, though?

43:40.952 --> 43:43.154
I'd like to thank him
for his help with everything.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.857
He just stepped out. He's gotta be
back for church and everything.

43:45.857 --> 43:47.192
Church? I'm sorry.

43:47.192 --> 43:49.494
Is it 4:00 o'clock on Sunday?

43:49.494 --> 43:50.929
No, ma'am, it's Saturday.

43:50.929 --> 43:53.198
But we so church
seven days a week here.

43:53.198 --> 43:54.365
So...

43:54.365 --> 43:56.434
That is a lot of churching.

43:58.503 --> 44:01.739
Okay. I guess, thanks again.

44:06.044 --> 44:08.880
Ma'am, you okay?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.516
Yeah, just, uh, have a headache.

44:11.516 --> 44:13.384
Why don't you head on over
to the supply store,

44:13.384 --> 44:15.286
fix it up?

44:15.286 --> 44:17.488
Thanks. I'll do that.

44:18.824 --> 44:20.859
Hangover's a bitch.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.233
Yeah.

44:28.233 --> 44:29.500
How did you...?

44:29.500 --> 44:31.502
On the count
of the bottles, ma'am,

44:31.502 --> 44:33.104
in your room.

44:35.907 --> 44:37.809
Got a good look
in there, did you?

44:56.261 --> 45:00.165
And kill me now.

45:31.129 --> 45:33.498
Uh, could I also grab
some ibuprophen?

45:38.603 --> 45:40.171
Thanks.

46:03.161 --> 46:04.896
Hello!

46:14.172 --> 46:15.907
Hello.

46:20.511 --> 46:22.080
Mack?

46:32.357 --> 46:34.392
Anybody home?

46:39.197 --> 46:40.698
Kris?

46:40.698 --> 46:43.568
You scared me.

46:43.568 --> 46:45.136
Slow day for you guys?

46:45.136 --> 46:47.138
Uh...

46:47.138 --> 46:49.574
Yeah, we usually don't get
much business during the day.

46:49.574 --> 46:51.309
I can see that.

46:55.546 --> 46:58.049
Um...

46:58.049 --> 46:59.384
What're you still doing here?

46:59.384 --> 47:00.718
We're getting ready to leave.

47:00.718 --> 47:03.721
I just figured
I'd come say goodbye.

47:03.721 --> 47:07.192
To thank you
for your hospitality.

47:07.192 --> 47:09.927
Sure. It was my pleasure.

47:13.398 --> 47:15.266
Okay.

47:15.266 --> 47:16.734
Well, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

47:16.734 --> 47:19.470
I'll let you get back
to work or whatever.

47:21.606 --> 47:23.174
Hey.

47:28.246 --> 47:30.248
You're a great girl.

47:30.248 --> 47:31.582
I'm sorry you have to leave.

47:31.582 --> 47:34.719
But, my advice...

47:37.122 --> 47:38.489
Drive like the wind.

47:40.091 --> 47:41.459
I always do.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.298
Bye, mack.

48:03.614 --> 48:05.350
What's with the pictures?

48:06.617 --> 48:08.353
Oh, whenever people move here

48:08.353 --> 48:10.455
we like to throw them a party.

48:10.455 --> 48:12.757
It's the neighborly thing to do.

48:20.765 --> 48:23.601
- Where are Terry and mack?
- They were the first ones here.

48:23.601 --> 48:26.537
No one was here
to take their picture.

48:26.537 --> 48:28.106
Hmm.

48:29.474 --> 48:31.209
Thanks.

48:37.582 --> 48:40.585
Hey, hey, hey. You're alive.

48:40.585 --> 48:43.788
- Barely.
- What'd you get me?

48:43.788 --> 48:45.756
Hah. For what ailes you.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.525
You're an angel.

48:47.525 --> 48:49.527
Did you go say bye
to your boyfriend?

48:49.527 --> 48:51.062
Indeed.

48:51.062 --> 48:52.397
Star-crossed lovers.

48:52.397 --> 48:54.265
That gets me every time.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.301
Shut it.

48:57.668 --> 49:00.338
Wait.

49:00.338 --> 49:02.773
What is that?

49:02.773 --> 49:05.576
That sounds like a party...

49:05.576 --> 49:07.178
No.

49:07.178 --> 49:10.515
- That I'm gonna go to.
- No party please.

49:10.515 --> 49:12.783
No party.

49:21.826 --> 49:24.529
- She's here!
- Emma Jean!

49:24.529 --> 49:27.098
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

49:27.098 --> 49:30.868
What did I tell you about gettin'
up in peoples personal space?

49:30.868 --> 49:32.737
Some people don't like it.

49:32.737 --> 49:35.440
- That's right.
- It's really okay.

49:35.440 --> 49:38.476
I have a lot of nieces and
nephews back home. So...

49:38.476 --> 49:41.212
I gave up on personal space
a long time ago.

49:41.212 --> 49:43.781
You still have to mind
your manners.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.783
Yes, ma'am.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.352
You must be Emma Jean's mom?

49:47.352 --> 49:48.686
No, ma'am.

49:48.686 --> 49:50.855
I just look after her
from time to time.

49:50.855 --> 49:52.723
Oh. Then where is she?

49:52.723 --> 49:55.426
Emma Jean!

49:55.426 --> 49:58.129
- What're you guys celebrating?
- Excuse me?

49:58.129 --> 50:00.365
Just seems like some kind
of backyard party.

50:00.365 --> 50:03.701
Minus the grilling and a yard.

50:03.701 --> 50:05.870
No, it's... it's not a party.

50:05.870 --> 50:08.539
We do this everyday.

50:08.539 --> 50:11.442
It's our way of keeping
in touch, I guess.

50:11.442 --> 50:13.878
Kind of like a family.

50:13.878 --> 50:15.613
You guys don't have jobs?

50:15.613 --> 50:18.249
Some folks do.

50:18.249 --> 50:20.418
Most don't need to.

50:20.418 --> 50:22.887
Mostly everything's
provided for us here.

50:22.887 --> 50:25.423
So then, what do you do all day?

50:25.423 --> 50:27.292
Well...

50:27.292 --> 50:29.460
This.

50:29.460 --> 50:30.795
And, in a few minutes,

50:30.795 --> 50:32.897
Terry will start
the daily service.

50:32.897 --> 50:34.899
He's the boss.

50:34.899 --> 50:36.401
Oh, is that right?

50:36.401 --> 50:37.802
Sure is.

50:40.271 --> 50:43.274
It seems like, uh,
nice enough kind of guy.

50:43.274 --> 50:44.609
Yes.

50:48.646 --> 50:50.515
Time for mass.

50:50.515 --> 50:52.850
I guess y'all better be
on your way now.

50:52.850 --> 50:55.386
- Come along, Emma Jean.
- But...

50:55.386 --> 50:57.188
Y'all drive safe now.

51:05.230 --> 51:07.632
Ladies.

51:07.632 --> 51:09.634
Oh, hey.

51:09.634 --> 51:10.968
I'm really glad
we ran into you, actually.

51:10.968 --> 51:12.770
I wanted to say
thanks for your help

51:12.770 --> 51:15.706
with the car and everything
before we hit...

51:15.706 --> 51:17.242
The road.

51:17.242 --> 51:19.410
Of course.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.579
I don't suppose I could tempt
you with a little churching

51:21.579 --> 51:23.514
before you head on your way?

51:23.514 --> 51:25.416
Um...

51:26.817 --> 51:28.653
No. I'm sorry.

51:28.653 --> 51:31.956
We would love to but we should
probably get going.

51:31.956 --> 51:34.825
Thank you, though.

51:34.825 --> 51:37.528
Did, uh... Did pj not tell you?

51:37.528 --> 51:40.531
There's no charge
on the repairs?

51:40.531 --> 51:41.966
Um, he did.

51:41.966 --> 51:43.834
I... I appreciate that.

51:43.834 --> 51:46.371
Well then, don't you think
it's the least you can do?

51:50.341 --> 51:51.642
Yes, I do.

51:51.642 --> 51:54.579
We can stay here
for a few minutes.

51:54.579 --> 51:57.282
I'm sure.

51:57.282 --> 51:58.649
Great.

52:07.992 --> 52:09.494
Hello, everybody.

52:09.494 --> 52:11.262
Thanks for coming.

52:17.702 --> 52:20.371
Before I bring Terry up,
I'd like to thank the lord

52:20.371 --> 52:22.273
- for our community.
- Amen.

52:23.574 --> 52:25.376
And for the forgiveness
of our sins.

52:25.376 --> 52:26.744
Amen.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.747
And for our visitors.

52:31.582 --> 52:33.884
May they have a safe trip home.

52:36.854 --> 52:38.756
Please stand.

52:39.990 --> 52:42.327
And that would be our cue.

52:42.327 --> 52:43.928
I can't do this cheesy shit.

52:51.035 --> 52:53.404
I know my brother's
not a riveting public speaker,

52:53.404 --> 52:55.473
but you can't
walk out in the middle.

52:55.473 --> 52:57.842
It's just common courtesy.

53:11.922 --> 53:14.925
Okay, so, Eve became pregnant

53:14.925 --> 53:17.662
and gave birth to Cain.

53:17.662 --> 53:18.996
She said,

53:18.996 --> 53:21.999
"with the help of our lord

53:21.999 --> 53:23.901
I have brought forth a man."

53:25.936 --> 53:28.939
Eve later gave birth to able.
Cain's brother.

53:28.939 --> 53:32.377
So, Cain, he works the fields.

53:32.377 --> 53:34.879
Able, keeps flocks.

53:37.615 --> 53:40.117
Cain takes fruit from the soil,

53:40.117 --> 53:43.053
brings it as an offering
to the lord.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.756
Able also brings an
offering, in his case,

53:45.756 --> 53:49.326
fat portions from the
offspring of the flock.

53:51.596 --> 53:55.966
Now without getting too
bogged down in the details...

53:55.966 --> 53:59.504
The lord looked down
upon able with favor,

53:59.504 --> 54:03.908
but for some unknowable reason,

54:03.908 --> 54:05.810
poor Cain got the shaft.

54:07.978 --> 54:10.415
I think anybody
with a little brother

54:10.415 --> 54:13.984
can relate to how Cain
must have felt.

54:13.984 --> 54:16.887
Completely and utterly betrayed.

54:19.557 --> 54:22.893
You know,
I wasn't always a priest.

54:22.893 --> 54:25.730
I came to this late in life
and then when people ask me,

54:25.730 --> 54:28.999
"now why would you
go do a thing like that?"

54:28.999 --> 54:31.168
I have to say honestly,

54:31.168 --> 54:34.639
I just was so sick and fed up

54:34.639 --> 54:36.807
of being disappointed.

54:38.008 --> 54:40.545
Feeling let down and betrayed

54:40.545 --> 54:42.580
by the people around me.

54:44.682 --> 54:47.685
And then I came to this place,

54:47.685 --> 54:49.820
and I had an epiphany.

54:49.820 --> 54:53.491
Maybe the problem is me.

54:53.491 --> 54:57.628
Maybe I spend so much time
feeling let down

54:57.628 --> 54:59.630
because I expect everyone
to concern themselves

54:59.630 --> 55:01.732
with my happiness.

55:01.732 --> 55:04.735
Well, what a selfish
and hallowed point of view.

55:09.039 --> 55:12.443
Do you want to stop feeling
let down in this world?

55:13.711 --> 55:15.045
Stop thinking about yourself

55:15.045 --> 55:17.882
and start thinking about others.

55:17.882 --> 55:20.918
Give yourself over.

55:20.918 --> 55:23.087
Give yourself over.

55:23.087 --> 55:27.625
That's how you stop feeling
empty and dissatisfied

55:27.625 --> 55:30.561
and betrayed.

55:30.561 --> 55:33.430
And that's what I love
about this place.

55:35.866 --> 55:39.436
I'm allowed to focus
my attention outward.

55:41.205 --> 55:44.775
To bringing as much light
and love to this place

55:44.775 --> 55:46.677
as possible.

55:48.078 --> 55:51.849
Populating this
little town with...

55:51.849 --> 55:53.684
Beauty and goodness.

55:55.586 --> 55:59.557
I have turned my back
on the outside world,

55:59.557 --> 56:03.528
and it has made me
very, very happy.

56:36.260 --> 56:38.796
Are you okay?

56:38.796 --> 56:41.131
Yeah, just this damn headache.

56:41.131 --> 56:43.000
I officially hate whiskey.

56:44.569 --> 56:45.903
I have heard that before.

56:45.903 --> 56:48.906
Well, I never learn, do I?

56:48.906 --> 56:50.240
Ugh.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.943
Sweet, sweet freedom!

56:52.943 --> 56:54.945
- Whew!
- Ow!

56:54.945 --> 56:57.147
Oh, wow.

56:58.883 --> 57:01.919
Ugh...

57:05.790 --> 57:07.892
- That's funny.
- I'm not joking.

57:17.267 --> 57:19.804
You've got to be kidding me?
What did you do?

57:19.804 --> 57:21.305
I was just turning on the radio.

57:21.305 --> 57:24.208
- You touched something.
- I did not touch anything!

57:26.644 --> 57:28.679
Oh, my God. This is so great.

57:28.679 --> 57:30.681
You're seriously
not fucking around.

57:30.681 --> 57:33.050
Do I look like
I'm fucking around?

57:34.852 --> 57:37.221
Yeah, well,
Terry did a great job.

57:37.221 --> 57:39.223
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a walk.

57:39.223 --> 57:41.325
You can't go for a walk.
You have to deal with the car.

57:41.325 --> 57:44.028
- You deal with it!
- Kris, just stop for a second.

57:44.028 --> 57:46.196
Okay? Jesus!

57:46.196 --> 57:48.899
Give me your phone. I will call triple-a.
It's gonna be fine.

57:48.899 --> 57:50.267
Fine. Deal with it.

57:59.877 --> 58:01.846
Yes, hi.
My name is Shannon silvers.

58:01.846 --> 58:04.581
I called... hell... hello?

58:06.050 --> 58:08.052
Hello?

58:08.052 --> 58:10.087
Just give me the fucking phone.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.842
- So are they coming?
- Yeah.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.077
It's gonna be a while, though.

58:33.077 --> 58:35.212
There's some kind of accident.

58:35.212 --> 58:38.749
By the way,
triple-a didn't send Terry.

58:38.749 --> 58:40.417
Wait. What?

58:40.417 --> 58:44.221
Triple-a didn't send Terry.

58:44.221 --> 58:46.223
What do you mean?

58:46.223 --> 58:48.759
I don't know.

58:53.163 --> 58:56.300
Well, speak of the devil.

59:06.243 --> 59:07.778
This might sound crazy,

59:07.778 --> 59:09.446
but I feel like
we've met before.

59:09.446 --> 59:12.750
I thought you fixed
the car, handyman.

59:12.750 --> 59:15.252
They say,
you get what you pay for.

59:19.957 --> 59:21.291
Give me another chance.

59:21.291 --> 59:24.061
I will figure out this mystery.

59:30.134 --> 59:32.703
Oh, um, you might wanna
call your triple-a office.

59:32.703 --> 59:34.371
They said they didn't
have any record of you

59:34.371 --> 59:35.973
picking us up last night.

59:35.973 --> 59:38.442
I wouldn't want you
to get in trouble.

59:38.442 --> 59:42.146
You know, I... I don't
suppose they would.

59:42.146 --> 59:43.881
Did you forget to tell them?

59:43.881 --> 59:46.216
I don't work for triple-a.

59:46.216 --> 59:48.118
I got the one boss already.

59:48.118 --> 59:51.288
Then how did you know
we were out there?

59:51.288 --> 59:54.859
A lot of people get stranded
on that stretch of road.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.263
I get my happiness
by helping others.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:02.166
Or did you sleep through
that part of my sermon?

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:05.235
Just out of the goodness
of your heart?

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:46.176
Yeah, feel free to hangout in
the office while I have a look.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:49.346
You know, I might be able
to get you out tonight.

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:52.883
Um, actually, do you have
a bathroom I could use?

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:56.420
Yeah, yeah, sure. Right around
the side there in the back.

01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:32.616
You doin' all right back here?

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:35.953
Sorry. I... I... um...

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.922
I thought the bathroom
was in here.

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.858
They don't make trucks
like that anymore.

01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:47.297
I guess not.

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:50.100
I remember when Emma Jean
and her mom rolled up in that,

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.637
I, uh, I could hardly
take my eyes off it.

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:57.507
Where is Emma Jean's mom?

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.310
Yeah, people don't have
much use for cars around here.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:04.348
You could practically throw a rock
from one end of town to the other.

01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:07.684
Safer to just keep 'em
locked up in the barn.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:11.555
Doesn't anybody
ever wanna leave?

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:14.191
Will you do me a favor?

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:17.027
When you're in Las Vegas
and you find yourself

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:20.364
getting sucked
into something shameless...

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:24.234
Just remind yourself
that there's somebody back here

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:27.204
who's thinking about you.

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:29.940
Who knows
that you deserve better.

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:40.985
Look, uh, we should
probably go back.

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:46.423
Sure.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:08.578
Hey. I'm starving. You hungry?

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:11.748
No, not really.

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:14.584
Or I can go with you
if you wanna eat?

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.220
If we head over to mack's,

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.089
can you just tell us
when the car's ready?

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:20.590
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:24.128
Ow. What is your deal?

01:04:24.128 --> 01:04:25.529
Something weird
is going on here.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.331
Look who decided
to join the party.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:30.067
No. I think this is a cult,
and he's like the leader.

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.401
Their cars are left
in that barn.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.037
These people are prisoners here.

01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:34.638
So what? That's their problem.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:37.074
Well, what if they're trying
to recruit us?

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:40.077
Believe me, the way these
idiots look at us,

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:42.912
the last two people on earth
they try to recruit is us.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.453
Ladybug broke down again,
as usual.

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:51.155
He's gonna fix it.
It's gonna be fine.

01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:52.656
- Let's get something food...
- I don't think that's...

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:54.624
Chill!

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:56.193
Let's go.

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:08.172
Hmm.

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.639
Thank you.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.175
Get you anything else?

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:13.610
Uh, no, we're good.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.312
Great.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.148
You have to let me know
what you think.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:19.483
I will.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:21.818
Are they world famous
like your burger?

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:23.753
My burgers are world's famous.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:27.757
These are more like, you know,
kain... kain famous.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.460
- They're popular just here.
- They're popular.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.096
Gotcha.

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:44.408
Your car awaits.

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.813
You can go. I'll pay.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:18.842
You shouldn't have
come back here.

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:20.577
Okay, well, it's not like
we planned on it.

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:22.112
Our car broke down.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.613
Yeah, I know.

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.615
Well,

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:28.418
I'm secretly glad
that it happened.

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.620
When we left you were being
an uber weirdo,

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.656
and I hate leaving
things like that.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.224
Maybe this is just
the universe's way

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:35.559
of giving us
another shot to, uh...

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:38.228
No!

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.497
Well, maybe.

01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:45.169
Trust me.

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:50.407
You made it sound like
it was ready to go.

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:52.276
Did I?

01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:54.444
No, I just wanted you
to have a look.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:58.315
Yeah, I think your battery's,
uh, kicked the bucket.

01:06:58.315 --> 01:06:59.816
Well, do you have another one?

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:01.785
Not for cars like this.

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:04.154
I mean, you know,
it's like I said,

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:05.822
we don't have much use
for cars around here.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:08.425
There's no point in keeping
a lot of spare parts around.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:11.261
Why are you being so
serious all of a sudden?

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:15.899
You gotta get outta here.

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:17.267
- Now!
- What're you talking about?

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.468
- Let's go. Come on.
- What...?

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:20.204
Let's go.

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:28.778
So I guess we're
staying another night.

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.815
Yeah, I'll talk to Charlie.
He'll take care of you.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.686
I shoulda caught it
this morning.

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:39.223
I... I... I was trying to get
you guys out on the road.

01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:41.825
I... I feel terrible. Believe me.

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.668
The truck's outside
of the building.

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.203
I'm gonna drive you
just outside of town,

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:54.904
and you can
catch a ride from there.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.607
If this is some lame attempt to get me to
makeout in your car it's not gonna happen.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:58.542
That's not it.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.910
- Well, why not?
- This is really important.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.446
Once I drop you off,

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:04.614
just keep walking, all right?

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.950
It's early. You won't have to wait
too long for a car to come by.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.818
- Okay, right, yeah.
- I mean it.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:10.354
This isn't funny anymore.

01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:12.356
Look. I'm not trying
to be funny.

01:08:12.356 --> 01:08:14.524
You have to understand.
This is for your own good.

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:16.225
- Now get in the car.
- I'm not going anywhere

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.560
- without Shannon.
- There's no time.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.796
- We have to go.
- Time for what?

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:23.367
Hey, what you doin'?

01:08:24.968 --> 01:08:27.270
We're just, um...

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.638
Goin' for a walk.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:31.675
Yeah, it's a nice night for it.

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:35.779
Is my brother behaving himself?

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:38.782
Yeah, he's just got
an odd sense of humor.

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:40.649
Oh, really?

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.519
I guess I never saw it.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:43.853
- Terry...
- Ugh...

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.389
I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

01:08:45.389 --> 01:08:48.358
but the car's gotta stay
one more night.

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:50.694
Shannon went back to the motel
to get settled in.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.296
I think she's looking for you.

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:53.830
Yeah. Okay.

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:57.701
Goodbye.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.035
Good night.

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:00.604
Yeah, good night.

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:10.580
Walk with me.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:15.419
Can I be brutally honest
with you?

01:09:15.419 --> 01:09:17.487
I feel like you've lost touch

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.022
with why we're here.

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:21.457
I know why we're here.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.794
Well, then you know that you do
have a certain obligation to me.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.663
I don't care. I'm done.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.001
I understand how you're feeling.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.002
You're having doubts.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:37.040
You know what I do when I have doubts?
I pray on it.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.776
I don't wanna do this anymore.

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:45.582
When was the last time
you prayed?

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:50.453
Not this room theatre
you do during the services.

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:55.559
When was the last time
that you really prayed?

01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:57.293
Ahh! Ahh!

01:10:01.965 --> 01:10:03.367
Ahh!

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:09.473
Look at that.

01:10:09.473 --> 01:10:11.508
It's like riding a bicycle.

01:10:15.078 --> 01:10:18.448
Dear heavenly father.

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:21.451
Please guide and protect
my little brother

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:25.355
from making a mistake
that he will deeply regret.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:28.358
Amen.

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:34.831
If you fuck this up for me,
mack, I swear to God.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.707
How many more?

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.480
I don't know.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.483
But all you need to do
is not be a dumb-ass,

01:10:53.483 --> 01:10:56.520
and you'll come out all
right on this deal.

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:09.833
Anyway, we were totally
about to makeout,

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:12.168
and then Terry showed up.

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:14.504
Uh-huh.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:17.507
Hello? Why the long face?

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:19.843
You're not the one
that just got cockblocked.

01:11:19.843 --> 01:11:21.711
I just have a bad feeling.

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:23.713
These people are just nuts.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.715
We have to laugh it off.
It's no big deal.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:28.051
- It's not the point.
- Well then, enlighten me.

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:31.955
I don't know. I just think
something feels really off.

01:11:33.156 --> 01:11:35.191
- Wanna get drunk again?
- No!

01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:37.561
Please, no more drinking.

01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:39.563
Well, you're gonna
have to snap out of it,

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:41.064
'cause you're no fun like this.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:43.800
- Okay. Sorry.
- Good.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.702
Now, get the hell
out of the bathroom.

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:47.170
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:49.873
- Like right now?
- Yeah, right now.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:51.741
What am I gonna do
for the next hour?

01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:54.077
You won't get drunk with me,
and mack won't makeout with me.

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:56.946
- You are incessant.
- Small word shan'.

01:11:56.946 --> 01:11:58.948
You're...

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:01.485
Never mind. Enjoy your shower.

01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:03.019
Love you.

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:20.937
Shit.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.611
Jesus Christ, shan',
that wasn't fucking funny.

01:12:27.611 --> 01:12:29.746
Just because you don't agree with me
doesn't mean you can just hang up

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.080
and then freak
the shit out of me.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.516
I know. I'm sorry.

01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:33.917
Our car broke down
outside of flag,

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:35.919
and we got towed
into this really small town.

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.921
And then my phone died,
but I wanted to call you

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:39.789
- and then...
- Shan'.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:41.791
- Josh?
- Shannon, are you there?

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.126
Josh?

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.928
- Hello?
- Can you hear me?

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.663
I wanna step outside. Hang on.

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:50.767
- Josh?
- Shan'?

01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:52.268
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Listen.

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:54.203
Call me when you wanna talk.
This is bullshit.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.205
No, Josh, I'm... Here.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.142
Jesus. This fucking town.

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:05.481
Hey, I'm using your phone.

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:31.541
- Hey.
- We need to talk.

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:43.019
What is so fucking important
that I can't finish my shower?

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.823
What is it you need to tell me?

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.191
What're you talking about?

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:52.662
I just saw Josh's text.

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:54.698
"Did you tell her yet?"

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.334
What do you need to tell me?

01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:00.336
- I don't... I don't know...
- Kris.

01:14:00.336 --> 01:14:02.105
It could be anything. I don't
know what he's talking about.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:03.873
Don't lie to me. Just tell me.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.879
That...

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:12.882
Last year at my birthday

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:15.251
when you guys
got in that huge fight...

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:19.022
He...

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:21.991
He stayed after
to help me clean.

01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:28.131
Shan', we were so drunk.
It was a huge mistake.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:29.666
I am so sorry.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.000
I wanted
to tell you so many times,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.702
I just... I got scared and I...

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.037
- Why'd you do this to me?
- You don't understand.

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:35.371
- And I...
- Please.

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:37.941
Don't tell me
that I don't understand.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:42.078
Was this the first time?

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:45.882
No.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.018
It happ...

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:50.920
- I fucked up, okay?
- No!

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.288
Please don't.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.325
I wanted to take this trip

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.862
so I could finally
get it off my chest

01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:01.865
and so we could
work it through and...

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:05.201
You weren't fucking
supposed to find out like that!

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:08.204
Why, you think
you could have done better?

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:10.239
I'm so sorry.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.277
I'm sure you are.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:17.146
Shannon, please stay.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.183
Where're you going?

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:23.887
Fuck.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.159
Hey.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.728
Something wrong?

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:09.866
I'm sorry. I would
really like to be alone.

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:15.739
I would think you'd had
enough of that by now.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.675
Aren't you tired of being alone?

01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:24.714
I...

01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:29.685
Really appreciate
what you're trying to do.

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:33.890
I am not in the mood
for a sermon.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.994
I understand.

01:16:37.994 --> 01:16:41.297
Well, how 'bout if you talk
and I listen?

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:46.035
What am I supposed to say?

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.470
Just, uh,

01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:50.173
tell me what it is
you're searching for.

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.886
I really don't know.

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:09.492
I guess...

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:16.365
A way that I can

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.534
stop letting the people
in my life

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:21.270
dictate how I feel about myself.

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:25.341
Look, Shannon.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.544
Since you showed up in town,

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:31.014
people are talking about you.

01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:33.516
They're saying,
who is this girl?

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:36.953
And why does she have
his great light about her?

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:41.925
You're so full of shit.

01:17:41.925 --> 01:17:45.094
This... this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:49.165
I think that the people
in your life

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.868
don't see how wonderful you are,

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:54.904
because you don't see
how wonderful you are.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.949
I'm not asking

01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:08.818
for you to accept my faith.

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:12.889
I'm just asking to have a
little faith in yourself.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:16.059
You're such a good person.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:17.894
You're so beautiful.

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:25.001
You're so beautiful.

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:30.239
- Shannon, now...
- Just stay away from me.

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.865
Get...

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:57.833
Jesus.

01:18:58.634 --> 01:19:00.269
Sorry.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:01.938
You scared me.

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:04.373
Why did you leave?

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.844
I'm sorry. We just had to go.

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:13.216
Have you seen my mom?

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:18.187
Emma Jean,
what're you doing here?

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:20.389
I can't find my mom.

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:24.160
How long has she been gone?

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.496
I don't know, but he was yelling

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:30.399
and then she was gone.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:35.504
Who was yelling? Your dad?

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.440
Your dad was yelling
at your mom?

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:45.014
I wanna go home.

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.086
You know where you live?

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:52.588
Yeah.

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:55.058
Will you take me?

01:19:59.362 --> 01:20:01.230
Yeah.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.565
All right.

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:04.300
Let's go.

01:20:11.674 --> 01:20:14.543
Emma Jean, how old are you?

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.079
Eight.

01:20:16.079 --> 01:20:17.580
Wow.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.215
You're really brave for eight.

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:21.550
Yeah, I know.

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:25.088
I bet you're really smart, too.

01:20:25.088 --> 01:20:26.956
I guess.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:28.992
No, trust me. I can tell.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.397
And smart people
are really special.

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:36.165
Wanna know why?

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.700
Yeah.

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:41.237
Uh, sometimes smart people
could see things

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:43.572
that other people can't see.

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.474
Like what?

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:49.112
Like...

01:20:49.112 --> 01:20:51.647
If something bad is happening.

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:56.085
Or someone's being hurt.

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:59.088
Well, if a smart person
sees these things,

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:03.426
then sometimes
they can help other people.

01:21:03.426 --> 01:21:06.395
Like their moms,
or their friends.

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:11.967
And it's not wrong
to talk about it.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:17.206
I'm not supposed to.

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:19.175
Okay.

01:21:19.175 --> 01:21:20.576
You don't have to.

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:27.150
But...

01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:31.087
If you do want to,

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:32.721
I promise I won't tell.

01:21:58.214 --> 01:21:59.548
I think you're smart, too.

01:22:02.185 --> 01:22:03.719
Thanks.

01:22:05.388 --> 01:22:08.757
But why can't you see?

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.793
Why can't I see what?

01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:23.506
Emma Jean?

01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:09.412
Emma Jean?

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:29.965
What are you doing?

01:24:29.965 --> 01:24:31.734
Come here.

01:24:40.943 --> 01:24:42.378
Why'd you run off like that?

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:44.880
I was worried about you.

01:24:50.986 --> 01:24:53.522
So, is this where you live?

01:24:57.493 --> 01:24:58.761
Hey.

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.663
What's wrong?

01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:03.999
Scared to go to sleep.

01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:06.201
Listen...

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.838
Hey.

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:11.974
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:25:11.974 --> 01:25:13.776
I'm gonna help you, okay?

01:25:18.281 --> 01:25:19.848
I just wanted to sleep.

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.784
Listen...

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:23.586
Did you hear me?

01:25:23.586 --> 01:25:25.020
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:28.991
You don't have
to be scared anymore.

01:25:31.694 --> 01:25:33.596
I couldn't see it etiher.

01:25:35.398 --> 01:25:36.965
Emma Jean, I...

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.767
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:41.270
What is it that you
want me to see?

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:49.512
I'll show you.

01:25:49.512 --> 01:25:51.013
What? No...

01:25:51.013 --> 01:25:52.781
Emma Jean, wait.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:15.704
I haven't found her.

01:26:15.704 --> 01:26:17.706
No, not yet.

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:19.808
Pj says he saw her walking towards
the trailers with Emma Jean,

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:22.010
so I'm gonna try over there.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.446
I'm moving Terry,

01:26:23.446 --> 01:26:24.966
don't talk to me
like I'm a damn child.

01:26:34.623 --> 01:26:36.459
Ow.

01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:48.437
My name's pj,
I was sent down by Terry.

01:26:55.378 --> 01:26:57.480
I couldn't see it either.

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:04.787
And for our visitors,
may they have a safe trip home.

01:27:13.095 --> 01:27:16.799
Once people settle in,
they... they don't usually leave.

01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:46.221
Kris! Kris!

01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:48.691
Get in here.

01:28:48.691 --> 01:28:50.559
- Kris!
- What is wrong with you?

01:28:50.559 --> 01:28:52.160
Shh! We have to get out of here.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.029
Don't you think we should tell...

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:56.699
No, I don't wanna talk to you.
I just wanna leave this...

01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:58.701
- Something is wrong here.
- Okay, you know what?

01:28:58.701 --> 01:29:00.569
At first your paranoia
was kinda cute,

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:02.237
- this is getting ridiculous.
- No, you just have to trust me.

01:29:02.237 --> 01:29:04.940
This is not a normal town.
These aren't normal people.

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.010
- What are you talking about?
- I don't...

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:10.579
I don't know how to
explain this to you.

01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:14.082
They're dead.

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:15.784
They're all dead.

01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:18.554
- You're kidding, right?
- I know it doesn't make sense.

01:29:18.554 --> 01:29:20.055
I was out there...

01:29:20.055 --> 01:29:21.857
Are you trying to tell me
that all these people

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:23.191
that we've been hanging
around the past few days

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.761
- were actually ghosts?
- Yes, Kris.

01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:27.863
I don't know how but they are.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:29.665
- You need help.
- No.

01:29:29.665 --> 01:29:31.166
Look, we can
argue about this later,

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:32.701
but right now I would
really like to go.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.570
- Look, if this is about...
- You owe me!

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:36.572
Can we go? Can we just do that?

01:29:36.572 --> 01:29:38.774
- Can we leave?
- Fine! We'll leave.

01:29:38.774 --> 01:29:40.776
Thank you.

01:29:40.776 --> 01:29:42.645
Oh, my God.

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:47.816
What room are we in?

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:49.251
One... I think.

01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:51.987
Why isn't there anything
in here?

01:29:51.987 --> 01:29:54.690
I don't know.

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:56.224
- Fuck.
- Where are you going?

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:19.047
Okay, I still don't know
if I believe you,

01:30:19.047 --> 01:30:21.750
- but that's fucking creepy.
- I told you.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.118
- Well, what is the plan?
- Um, I don't know.

01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:24.820
Maybe my car will start. If not,

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:26.288
there's a whole bunch more
in that barn thing.

01:30:26.288 --> 01:30:28.857
Worst case we leave our shit and
walk through the road. I don't care.

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:31.627
- I'm not leaving my shit in the middle of nowhere.
- That's fine, Kris.

01:30:31.627 --> 01:30:33.328
It's your call,
but I will leave you here.

01:30:33.328 --> 01:30:36.198
Fine. But I'm only leaving it
if I absolutely have to.

01:30:36.198 --> 01:30:38.601
Whatever. Will you hand me
my purse, please?

01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:40.969
- Yeah. Here.
- Thanks.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:53.148
- Did you dry your hair?
- What?

01:30:53.148 --> 01:30:55.751
After your shower.
Did you dry your hair?

01:30:55.751 --> 01:30:58.821
Yeah, you know I don't like
to sleep with it wet.

01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:00.188
Yeah...

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:02.858
Only...

01:31:02.858 --> 01:31:04.693
I'm gonna...

01:31:04.693 --> 01:31:06.595
Grab my stuff.

01:31:06.595 --> 01:31:07.996
Okay.

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:49.772
Now we really have to talk.

01:31:49.772 --> 01:31:51.306
Shannon, you don't
have to leave.

01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:53.241
It's better this way.
You just have to see it.

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:18.734
Fuck!

01:32:23.939 --> 01:32:26.341
Where'd you go, pretty girl?

01:32:28.343 --> 01:32:31.046
You got a lot of people
looking for you.

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.889
You know,
the sooner you come out,

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:43.091
the easier it's gonna
be, I promise.

01:32:55.771 --> 01:32:57.339
Gotcha.

01:33:41.516 --> 01:33:45.053
I know I owe you
an apology, Shannon.

01:33:45.053 --> 01:33:46.321
I'm not a bad person.

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:50.826
Everybody here,
we're all decent people.

01:33:50.826 --> 01:33:52.260
If you'll just let me,

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.862
I can talk you through
this whole thing.

01:33:53.862 --> 01:33:57.465
It's not that scary.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.802
But I do need you
to give yourself over.

01:34:06.809 --> 01:34:08.777
So come on out, let's talk.

01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:29.197
Fine.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:33.836
You win.

01:34:44.479 --> 01:34:47.015
Shannon, open the door.
Shannon...

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:48.583
Open the mother fucking door!

01:34:48.583 --> 01:34:50.018
I'm not fucking around.

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:53.856
Shannon, you need help.

01:34:53.856 --> 01:34:55.891
Let me help you.

01:34:57.059 --> 01:34:59.094
No, you need help, asshole.

01:35:14.276 --> 01:35:16.845
Yes! Yes!

01:35:18.246 --> 01:35:19.547
Oh, my God.

01:35:27.289 --> 01:35:28.857
Come on.

01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:56.184
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:35:56.184 --> 01:35:58.153
You just stay away from me.

01:35:58.153 --> 01:36:00.322
Is that really how you're gonna
talk to your best friend?

01:36:00.322 --> 01:36:02.190
You're not my friend.

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:03.892
I don't even know what you are.

01:36:03.892 --> 01:36:05.327
I'm just like you.

01:36:05.327 --> 01:36:08.663
But I can see it now,
and soon you will, too.

01:36:08.663 --> 01:36:12.100
Please, just let me go.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.602
The only way out of here
is through him.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.221
Hey, there.

01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:38.326
Why won't you let me go?

01:36:38.326 --> 01:36:42.597
Jesus Christ, Shannon,
I don't control this place.

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:45.200
If I did, I wouldn't
be chasing you around.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.669
You just belong to me.

01:36:50.372 --> 01:36:53.675
Are you even a priest?

01:36:53.675 --> 01:36:56.211
Well, I used to dress up
as a sheriff,

01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:59.314
but I felt kinda stupid with
the boots and the cowboy hat.

01:37:02.384 --> 01:37:03.551
You are.

01:37:07.622 --> 01:37:09.191
Walk with me.

01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:11.426
I'm not going

01:37:11.426 --> 01:37:13.361
anywhere with you.

01:37:13.361 --> 01:37:15.530
Okay then, go.

01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:17.065
Pick a direction.

01:37:17.065 --> 01:37:19.167
Run as fast as you can.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:21.003
I'll see you right back
here in ten minutes.

01:37:21.003 --> 01:37:22.504
No.

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:28.110
Just how it works.

01:37:37.285 --> 01:37:39.354
It was new year's Eve.

01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:43.291
I came home to find mack

01:37:43.291 --> 01:37:45.627
with my wife.

01:37:45.627 --> 01:37:47.395
I guess... I guess he thought

01:37:47.395 --> 01:37:51.333
we shared our women, too.

01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:54.669
They didn't see me,
I didn't say anything.

01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:57.205
I just took off.

01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:59.041
Came back a couple hours later.

01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:00.575
You know,

01:38:00.575 --> 01:38:02.477
three of us proceeded
to get piss drunk

01:38:02.477 --> 01:38:04.079
for the holiday.

01:38:06.414 --> 01:38:10.285
Thought we'd go to a bar
watch the ball drop.

01:38:10.285 --> 01:38:12.020
I volunteered to drive.

01:38:14.022 --> 01:38:17.025
I was so mad,
I couldn't see straight.

01:38:17.025 --> 01:38:18.493
I could only think of them...

01:38:18.493 --> 01:38:20.262
Two of them together.

01:38:22.564 --> 01:38:26.168
Somewhere along the way
I said, "fuck it."

01:38:26.168 --> 01:38:28.736
Drove the truck off the road.

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:31.373
Straight into a tree at 75.

01:38:33.575 --> 01:38:35.143
You all died.

01:38:35.143 --> 01:38:37.345
Well...

01:38:37.345 --> 01:38:40.048
My wife made it.

01:38:40.048 --> 01:38:41.383
At least that's what I assume.

01:38:41.383 --> 01:38:43.418
She's not here.

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:49.524
But mack and I
somehow got stuck.

01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:56.664
We can't leave.

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:59.801
We don't get old.

01:38:59.801 --> 01:39:04.306
So nothing better to do,
so we built a town.

01:39:04.306 --> 01:39:06.674
Called it kain.

01:39:09.177 --> 01:39:12.214
And what does this
have to do with me?

01:39:12.214 --> 01:39:14.782
Well, you know, they say
misery loves company.

01:39:16.751 --> 01:39:18.786
Mack and I got kinda sick
of looking at each other.

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.688
We started figuring out ways

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:23.425
to get other people

01:39:23.425 --> 01:39:26.494
stuck here.

01:39:26.494 --> 01:39:28.163
We realized
that if you die here,

01:39:28.163 --> 01:39:30.132
then you're in it
for the long haul.

01:39:30.132 --> 01:39:32.066
Like the rest of us.

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:36.338
For almost 50 years,

01:39:36.338 --> 01:39:38.373
I've been holding my breath...

01:39:38.373 --> 01:39:40.542
Hoping maybe I would look up

01:39:40.542 --> 01:39:43.745
and see her walking
down main street.

01:39:43.745 --> 01:39:46.148
And then you showed up.

01:39:46.148 --> 01:39:47.415
And I thought,

01:39:47.415 --> 01:39:49.317
this has to be a sign.

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.618
I mean, you're...

01:39:50.618 --> 01:39:52.220
You're so much like her.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:53.521
It's amazing.

01:39:53.521 --> 01:39:55.190
I mean,
what are the chances, right?

01:39:55.190 --> 01:39:56.724
Please tell me
you're not about to give me

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:58.526
some kind of flick a pitch.

01:39:58.526 --> 01:40:00.595
Don't be dismissive!

01:40:00.595 --> 01:40:03.331
I poured my fucking guts
out to you!

01:40:08.770 --> 01:40:10.538
Fuck.

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.342
Whoo!

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:15.710
Look at us.

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:18.680
Fighting in the middle
of main street,

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.482
like a regular married couple.

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:26.288
Look.

01:40:26.288 --> 01:40:27.655
We don't have much.

01:40:27.655 --> 01:40:29.191
I know.

01:40:29.191 --> 01:40:31.693
But we are a family.

01:40:31.693 --> 01:40:33.761
And we take care of our own.

01:40:35.697 --> 01:40:38.166
That sweet little girl,
Emma Jean.

01:40:38.166 --> 01:40:39.634
She's taken to you.

01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:49.711
It would be a whole lot easier
if you just said, "yes."

01:40:56.284 --> 01:40:57.785
No.

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:10.565
That is your perogitive.

01:41:14.202 --> 01:41:18.206
Come with me, I will
show you how to leave.

01:41:18.206 --> 01:41:19.874
What?

01:41:21.209 --> 01:41:22.944
A deal's a deal.

01:42:11.359 --> 01:42:13.328
I need to show you something.

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:21.536
This is gonna seem weird.

01:42:42.324 --> 01:42:43.558
- Easy. Easy.
- Oh, my God.

01:42:43.558 --> 01:42:45.760
- Oh, my...
- Easy.

01:42:54.769 --> 01:42:57.339
I didn't wanna do it.

01:42:57.339 --> 01:43:00.007
You were laying there...

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:03.845
So peaceful and perfect.

01:43:06.047 --> 01:43:08.516
I didn't want you to leave.

01:43:08.516 --> 01:43:10.385
So I...

01:43:11.853 --> 01:43:13.821
Put my hands on your throat.

01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:17.592
How could you do that?

01:43:17.592 --> 01:43:18.960
From the moment that I met you,

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.063
I was afraid that I
was gonna lose you.

01:43:24.799 --> 01:43:26.568
You're special, Shannon.

01:43:26.568 --> 01:43:28.903
And you belong here.

01:43:30.672 --> 01:43:33.107
I'm so sorry.

01:43:33.107 --> 01:43:35.410
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:36.878
Please. Please. Please.

01:43:36.878 --> 01:43:39.381
No, get off me,
I will never forgive you.

01:43:39.381 --> 01:43:41.048
I will never forgive you.

01:43:43.485 --> 01:43:45.820
I will never forgive you.

01:43:58.666 --> 01:44:01.603
Well, we have a long time
to work through that.

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:08.075
You told me I could leave.

01:44:11.145 --> 01:44:15.483
Some people pass on...

01:44:15.483 --> 01:44:18.553
Emma Jean's mother...

01:44:18.553 --> 01:44:21.723
I don't know where she is.

01:44:21.723 --> 01:44:23.791
Because I don't know
where we are.

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.563
But the alternative,

01:44:28.563 --> 01:44:30.565
what if it's no better?

01:44:30.565 --> 01:44:33.635
It's a choice.

01:44:33.635 --> 01:44:35.703
You can stay here

01:44:35.703 --> 01:44:39.541
with people that love you.

01:44:39.541 --> 01:44:40.675
Or take your chances

01:44:40.675 --> 01:44:44.812
on heaven or hell

01:44:44.812 --> 01:44:47.749
or nothing.

01:44:47.749 --> 01:44:50.952
I mean, would you prefer
if it was nothing?

01:45:12.974 --> 01:45:15.009
You'd have no voice
in that world.

01:45:21.549 --> 01:45:23.117
Hello?

01:45:23.117 --> 01:45:24.619
Josh?

01:45:24.619 --> 01:45:27.522
Shan'?

01:45:27.522 --> 01:45:29.557
Oh, thank God.

01:45:29.557 --> 01:45:31.058
He said you wouldn't
be able to hear me,

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:33.027
but you can hear me
and now you can come get me.

01:45:33.027 --> 01:45:34.562
And it's gonna be okay.

01:45:34.562 --> 01:45:37.064
Please come get me.

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:39.901
Please say something.

01:45:39.901 --> 01:45:41.969
But I just did.

01:45:41.969 --> 01:45:43.871
Listen, this is the last
time I'm gonna answer, okay,

01:45:43.871 --> 01:45:46.007
unless you just say something.

01:45:53.214 --> 01:45:54.916
You can't hear me, can you?

01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:58.185
I hope you know
what you're doing.

01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:00.021
Be safe.

01:46:00.021 --> 01:46:02.056
I love you.

01:46:54.876 --> 01:46:56.611
Do you see it now?

01:47:00.848 --> 01:47:02.617
I see it.

01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:44.726
