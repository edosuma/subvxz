WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.601
<i>Previously on</i> reign:

00:02.603 --> 00:04.336
Every time I turn around,
he's beside you.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.772
I want a good life
and a husband to share it with.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.208
I wonder if you might entertain

00:09.210 --> 00:10.676
A chance to be a queen.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.011
I can't keep living like this.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.645
Be my wife.
Too much

00:13.647 --> 00:16.548
Has passed between us.
And now you
want to go to condÃ©.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.283
I forbid it.
Mary: <i>Come to</i>

00:18.285 --> 00:20.686
Scotland with me.
I want you.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.354
Antoine:
I've had a message from England.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.757
Queen elizabeth wants you.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.442
That'll be the count
and countess du grace.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.110
Your majesty, I present you
my daughter, lady anna.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.512
Two places, fifth table
from the king's.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.113
Kenna, I'm impressed.
You've really

00:48.115 --> 00:49.782
Got this all in hand,
don't you?

00:49.784 --> 00:52.518
Mm, I'm surprised catherine
trusted you to plan the banquet.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.119
The dauphin vintage
tasting is not exactly

00:54.121 --> 00:55.687
A coronation,
but still,

00:55.689 --> 00:58.257
The chance to taste wine
bottled on the day of the king's

00:58.259 --> 00:59.792
Birth is bringing nobles
from all over France.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.560
Well, actually,
it was mary's decision,

01:01.562 --> 01:03.295
Although
I'm sure catherine

01:03.297 --> 01:04.530
Would have happily
given me the opportunity

01:04.532 --> 01:07.066
Just to see me fail.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.801
Oh, dear.
I recognize

01:08.803 --> 01:10.202
Count du grace, but

01:10.204 --> 01:11.537
That's not
the countess.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.205
Do you think he
brought his mistress?

01:13.207 --> 01:15.374
No, he's hoping
he brought the king's mistress.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.309
I don't understand.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.311
I should have warned you.
I suppose I expected

01:19.313 --> 01:21.847
You'd instinctively
grasp every nuance

01:21.849 --> 01:24.516
Of the sordid tradition
of a king's mistress.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.485
But the king doesn't
have a mistress.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.521
Catherine:
Not yet. That's why
these lords are bringing

01:29.523 --> 01:31.557
Their ready young daughters.
They're hoping that

01:31.559 --> 01:33.325
Francis will
choose one of them

01:33.327 --> 01:34.726
To take to his bed.
And what makes

01:34.728 --> 01:36.595
Them think that francis
wants a mistress?

01:36.597 --> 01:38.797
Our estrangement
has become obvious.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.632
Separate chambers...

01:40.634 --> 01:42.201
Lola:
Well, plenty of kings
and queens keep

01:42.203 --> 01:44.470
Separate chambers.
You did.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.205
Just when I was
starting to like you.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.706
Kenna:
I'll have to completely
rearrange the seating.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.142
I won't have any of these
pert little opportunists

01:50.144 --> 01:51.610
Sitting anywhere
near mary.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.212
Don't worry about it, kenna.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.347
Your outrage is touching,

01:55.349 --> 01:57.850
But I can hardly take offense
when I'm the one who suggested

01:57.852 --> 01:59.685
We live separate lives.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.254
You don't want that...

02:03.857 --> 02:06.625
I suppose in their minds,
it's a simple trade.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.161
One daughter will be bedded
by a man she'll never marry,

02:09.163 --> 02:12.865
But if that man is the king and
the family now has his favor,

02:12.867 --> 02:14.733
It's worth it.
Oh, yes.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.702
It worked for the boleyn girls.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.770
Well, for their father, anyway.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.372
Well, they won't get anywhere.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.874
Not with francis.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.509
He loves mary.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.144
Things change, lola.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.181
If francis
and mary are finished,

02:29.183 --> 02:30.883
There's an opportunity
at the king's side

02:30.885 --> 02:32.784
For some lucky girl here.

02:32.786 --> 02:36.722
â™ª time alone with
the pounding of your heart â™ª

02:36.724 --> 02:40.192
â™ª as it starts to heal

02:40.194 --> 02:43.762
â™ª you'll find a better mirror
in another... â™ª

02:43.764 --> 02:45.230
I need to speak with you.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.899
There are plans to settle.
Scotland.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.333
This is not the place.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.501
Hardly.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.636
Shouldn't there
be an empty room

02:50.638 --> 02:51.904
In the wine cellar now,

02:51.906 --> 02:53.338
Devoid of a certain vintage?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.174
I'll meet you there in an hour.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.645
I have some good news
for you, little brother.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.812
The english queen's envoy
is in the village,

03:00.814 --> 03:01.947
And I've arranged a meeting.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.515
If you can charm him

03:03.517 --> 03:05.350
As well as you've
charmed the scots queen,

03:05.352 --> 03:07.519
You may end up with
an english crown on your head.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.521
If I have a head left
to put it on.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.956
You take too many risks,
antoine.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.858
What if francis finds out
you have me courting elizabeth?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.927
Have they found out what
we've been up to so far?

03:14.929 --> 03:16.728
He knows his mother
and father were poisoned,

03:16.730 --> 03:18.530
And barely missed learning
you were behind it.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.965
And yet here we are,

03:19.967 --> 03:21.600
Only two or three
chess moves away

03:21.602 --> 03:23.268
From becoming
a pair of bourbon kings.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.770
Exactly as we were destined

03:24.772 --> 03:26.205
By blood.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.274
Your majesty.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.476
Majesty.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.678
Please allow
me to present

03:32.680 --> 03:34.313
My niece, lady amelie.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.447
Majesty.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.982
Welcome to court, lady amelie.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.450
She's my sister's child,

03:38.452 --> 03:39.985
But my pride

03:39.987 --> 03:41.887
Swells for her as
if she were my own.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.655
Brilliant mind,

03:43.657 --> 03:47.392
And a lover of all the...
Sensual arts.

03:48.494 --> 03:49.995
Enjoys poetry,

03:49.997 --> 03:51.230
Plays the lute
like an angel,

03:51.232 --> 03:52.431
And has a gift

03:52.433 --> 03:54.833
For embroidery.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.468
As a matter of
fact, amelie,

03:56.470 --> 03:57.669
Why don't you
take a look

03:57.671 --> 03:59.371
At the annunciation tapestry
in the map room?

03:59.373 --> 04:01.340
Stunning work.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.312
There is no scrap
of courtly advantage

04:07.314 --> 04:09.581
You won't stoop to grasp,
is there?

04:09.583 --> 04:12.718
Even offering
your own niece as a mistress.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.287
Don't we all have a duty
to grasp what life offers?

04:15.289 --> 04:18.457
But as a king may
not stoop to grasp,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.525
His subjects must offer.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.294
Well, as long as
you're offering things,

04:22.296 --> 04:23.996
Kindly do me the favor
of making it known

04:23.998 --> 04:25.597
I am not seeking a mistress.

04:31.671 --> 04:34.439
Multiple lords have brought both
wives and daughters,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.008
So we'll need
two extra tables.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.542
We'll also need extra cake,
extra everything.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.411
This is the new seating chart.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.014
King antoine, you're still here.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.615
I'd heard...

04:43.617 --> 04:46.018
That I was scheduled
to return to navarre?

04:46.020 --> 04:47.552
So you're keeping tabs on me.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.489
Well, I take hope from that.
Don't.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.591
I couldn't leave,
not without your answer.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.993
My answer is no.
Well, that's not the answer
I was hoping to leave with.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.561
So here I'll stay.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.497
I don't trust you,
and I don't believe you.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.898
Why?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.633
Because your suggestion
that we should wed

05:01.635 --> 05:03.535
As soon as your ailing wife dies
is so rash.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.670
It is rash,

05:04.672 --> 05:06.038
And yet here I am.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.906
I can't seem
to take back my words,

05:07.908 --> 05:10.842
And I can't seem to leave you.
Antoine, I'm married.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.377
Well, if that's
your only objection,

05:12.379 --> 05:13.679
Then you've given me
even more hope.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.914
Please, come to me.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.082
So we can talk,

05:17.084 --> 05:18.583
Just talk.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.661
I'm so sorry, mary.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.064
If I'd known the kind of guests
the event would draw,

05:32.066 --> 05:33.565
I would have canceled
the tasting.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.100
It's not your fault.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.968
Rumors of our distance
is spreading.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.837
Timing of the event is terrible.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.341
I don't think time would
change much for us, francis.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.076
Yes, well, that is where
you and I disagree.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.544
Not the only place.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.945
CondÃ©.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.680
Does it not strike you
as unfair that I am

05:48.682 --> 05:50.349
Forbidden to live my life
the way I desire...

05:50.351 --> 05:51.683
Don't speak to me

05:51.685 --> 05:53.819
Of your desire for another.
My desire to put

05:53.821 --> 05:56.455
The horrors of my past
behind me.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.623
I feel as though I'm drowning.
Mary.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.958
I need to breathe again.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.526
To be happy.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.862
An affair with condÃ©
endangers your life

06:03.864 --> 06:05.731
And our countries' alliance.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.799
Is that all there is to it?

06:07.801 --> 06:10.068
No jealousy or regret?

06:10.070 --> 06:12.037
Because you think that
if you simply bide your time,

06:12.039 --> 06:13.405
I will come back to you?

06:13.407 --> 06:15.374
I do think that.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.775
I love you,

06:16.777 --> 06:18.110
And I would do anything

06:18.112 --> 06:19.745
To undo the choices I made

06:19.747 --> 06:21.613
Now that I know their outcome,
but I can't.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.648
Nor can I alter the fact
that we live in a world

06:23.650 --> 06:25.150
Where a queen's infidelity

06:25.152 --> 06:26.985
Is considered an act of treason,

06:26.987 --> 06:30.989
Because any child you had
must be presumed illegitimate.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.959
The nobles would want your head
and demand condÃ©'s,

06:33.961 --> 06:37.095
And I can't promise I could
protect either of you.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.698
And in condÃ©'s case,
I'm not sure I'd want to.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.066
I can't do this anymore.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.434
Do what?

06:42.436 --> 06:43.802
Hear the truth of our lives?

06:43.804 --> 06:45.170
I'm sorry, but I am determined

06:45.172 --> 06:46.772
To stop you
from making a decision

06:46.774 --> 06:48.006
That could cost you your head.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.141
And there is no more

06:49.143 --> 06:50.942
To say on the subject.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.088
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

07:05.758 --> 07:08.126
â™ª they all need something

07:08.128 --> 07:13.031
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

07:13.033 --> 07:16.635
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

07:16.637 --> 07:20.539
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

07:20.541 --> 07:23.708
â™ª

07:34.754 --> 07:36.521
Are those the things
antoine gave you?

07:36.523 --> 07:38.790
No, as a matter of fact,
I sent those back.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.525
If you want
to castigate me...

07:40.527 --> 07:43.195
Don't worry, I'm not
seeking an argument. I...

07:43.197 --> 07:44.963
I thought we might talk.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.932
Must we?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.501
You had plenty to say
the other night. What's changed?

07:49.503 --> 07:50.936
I just don't really see
the point.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.804
If things have got that bad,
how can there not be

07:52.806 --> 07:54.639
A point in talking?
Bash, I'm sorry,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.007
But I have a banquet to manage.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.186
I'm sorry I took so long.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.888
I kept having
to change directions.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.957
I ran into servants
at every step of the way.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.992
Have you thought
about how you'll achieve this?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.194
I have hired an agent
to gather intelligence for me.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.063
I need to know
which harbors are safe to land,

08:18.065 --> 08:19.631
Which nobles I can trust,

08:19.633 --> 08:21.266
Which areas
haven't been infiltrated

08:21.268 --> 08:22.834
By elizabeth's troops.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.603
I think I can help with that.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.805
I've arranged a trade delegation
from my principality.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.574
It'll book passage to scotland
for enough men to protect

08:29.576 --> 08:31.977
A sizable portion of gold
or a queen

08:31.979 --> 08:33.512
Traveling under
a false name.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.913
Louis, that's very generous,

08:34.915 --> 08:37.082
But you'd be
opening yourself up

08:37.084 --> 08:38.850
To retribution from your king.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.585
My king can't hurt me

08:40.587 --> 08:42.721
If he is in France
and I'm in scotland.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.290
Then you've made up your mind?

08:45.292 --> 08:47.759
You want to come with me?

08:47.761 --> 08:49.628
There is no place I'd rather be.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.566
I don't know what to say.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.769
I'm sorry.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.070
I can't.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.672
It's not yet safe for that.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.076
But for the first time
in so long,

09:05.078 --> 09:08.146
I think the time is close.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.814
(sighs)

09:22.695 --> 09:24.095
Fetch me something.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.765
I don't care what it is,
but fetch it from far away.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.574
I have to ask you something.

09:36.709 --> 09:37.909
You're a king.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.045
You could have anyone.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.914
So honestly, antoine, why me?

09:42.916 --> 09:45.584
It is not easy for most men
to love you.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.919
You lack shame, kenna,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.054
Which makes you bold.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.789
It makes you seem open
to the pleasures

09:50.791 --> 09:52.190
That men want to give to you,

09:52.192 --> 09:55.126
But later it makes
you seem open to rivals.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.862
This makes men jealous.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.197
But not me.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.032
I have no use for shame,

10:01.034 --> 10:03.201
And I do not fear rivals.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.137
These are all lovely words,
antoine,

10:06.139 --> 10:08.139
But they don't change the fact

10:08.141 --> 10:10.208
That you have a wife,
and I a husband.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.911
You have a husband
who no longer trusts you.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.212
I think if you ask him
for an annulment,

10:14.214 --> 10:15.347
He will grant you one.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.915
I have a dying wife

10:16.917 --> 10:18.283
Who wants me to find

10:18.285 --> 10:19.918
A mother for our children.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.620
Are you sure you want a mother

10:21.622 --> 10:23.154
For your children
who has no shame?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.789
(chuckles)

10:24.791 --> 10:27.359
Well, I believe shame
is the worst thing

10:27.361 --> 10:29.060
A parent can teach
their children.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.663
I want my children
to be joyful

10:31.665 --> 10:33.832
And frank and adventurous.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.966
Like you.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.068
But if parenthood

10:37.070 --> 10:38.903
Is something
that doesn't interest you...
No.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.805
It does, actually.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.107
More so
than it does

10:42.109 --> 10:43.708
My husband.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.377
Kenna, my last marriage
was for duty and politics.

10:45.379 --> 10:48.747
I want my next marriage
to be about something more.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.092
I can't.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.695
I'm so sorry,
I have to go.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.003
It's lovely and grand and all,
but it won't do.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.139
I need to show
my meat and potatoes.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.008
First of all,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.744
Try not to refer to your body
as "meat and potatoes."

11:19.746 --> 11:20.812
The men you are
trying to attract

11:20.814 --> 11:22.747
Are looking for
something more...

11:22.749 --> 11:24.015
Refined.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.283
Pay attention, gigi.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.218
Greer knows what
she's talking about.

11:27.953 --> 11:29.754
Fine. I'm wearing

11:29.756 --> 11:31.289
Your nun's habit.
What's next?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.224
(knocking at door)

11:36.896 --> 11:38.063
Excuse me.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.297
I'm looking
for...

11:39.299 --> 11:41.399
Greer.

11:45.304 --> 11:48.039
(laughing)

11:48.041 --> 11:49.074
Leith:
Is this a bad time?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.209
No! Uh... Yes! I...

11:51.211 --> 11:54.312
Uh... My a-attending ladies

11:54.314 --> 11:56.181
And I were just...
(laughing)

11:56.183 --> 11:58.216
...Trying on dresses.
Attending ladies?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.317
Shh!

11:59.319 --> 12:00.452
I'll-I'll meet you

12:00.454 --> 12:01.853
Downstairs, shall I?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.188
Leith:
All right.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.057
(clears throat)

12:06.059 --> 12:07.726
Later.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.494
I'll tell you everything later.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.162
(laughing)

12:11.164 --> 12:12.731
Leith:
I, uh,

12:12.733 --> 12:14.499
I was deployed at languedoc.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.301
That's when I
heard the news.

12:16.303 --> 12:19.037
I checked for you at the
castle, and that's when

12:19.039 --> 12:21.840
I learned that you'd moved here,
to town.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.375
Patron: Bugger off!
(indistinct argument)

12:24.377 --> 12:26.411
I'm not going anywhere
until you...

12:26.413 --> 12:28.813
Pay no attention. The customers
like to complain the beer's

12:28.815 --> 12:30.348
Been watered down, but
as soon as they drink

12:30.350 --> 12:31.850
Enough of it, they settle.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.051
What?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.819
I'm not used to hearing you...

12:34.821 --> 12:36.020
Speak like that.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.490
No, I meant what news?

12:40.359 --> 12:41.793
Lord castleroy.

12:41.795 --> 12:45.430
I'm afraid
he's in prison.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.398
Convicted of treason
for funding the castle attack.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.334
Wealthy friends
commuted

12:49.336 --> 12:51.469
His death sentence,
so he'll live,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.004
But...

12:53.006 --> 12:54.506
He'll never be free again.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.341
My god.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.542
Not ever.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.144
Poor aloysius.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.945
I worried

13:00.947 --> 13:03.214
When I hadn't heard
from him, but...

13:03.216 --> 13:05.383
That's it, then.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.552
Any chance we had
of a future...

13:09.989 --> 13:12.290
I'm so sorry.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.828
Greer, how are you faring?

13:18.397 --> 13:19.564
I'm all right.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.267
Um, with-without your husband

13:22.269 --> 13:24.269
Or your...
Your position with mary?

13:24.271 --> 13:26.504
It's been...

13:26.506 --> 13:28.439
An adjustment, of course,

13:28.441 --> 13:30.275
But I'm finding my way.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.409
How?

13:31.411 --> 13:33.511
Thank you for taking the time

13:33.513 --> 13:34.579
To bring me news
of my husband.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.914
I'm sure
it can't have been easy.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.282
Good day
to you, leith.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.550
And good luck,

13:38.552 --> 13:39.984
Now that you're back.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.057
Brother!

13:46.059 --> 13:49.260
(sighs)
you don't look to be
dressed for the tasting.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.329
I was about to take a ride.
It will have to
be a short ride

13:51.331 --> 13:52.897
If you don't want
to miss your meeting

13:52.899 --> 13:54.299
With the english queen's envoy.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.568
He's anxious to meet
her new bourbon suitor.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.436
You'll have to reset the
meeting; I can't do it tonight.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.905
I went to considerable lengths
to get us this meeting.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.074
You'll have to do better
than "not tonight."

14:03.076 --> 14:04.976
I have my own principality,
antoine,

14:04.978 --> 14:06.544
With needs that concern me
and not you.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.346
It concerns me
if your principality might

14:08.348 --> 14:10.081
Get in the way of our family
obtaining a kingdom.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.283
You can't have a new kingdom
without me as king.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.552
I'd bear that in mind.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.256
Amelie:
I'm looking forward

14:18.258 --> 14:20.191
To tasting your vintage,
majesty.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.492
Greatly.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.228
Lady amelie, I'm sorry to say

14:23.230 --> 14:24.629
I will have to miss
tonight's festivities.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.331
But I do hope you enjoy them.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.366
Are you sure?
Will you reconsider?

14:28.368 --> 14:31.202
Mary, I was just explaining
to lord stephan's niece

14:31.204 --> 14:33.071
That I can't make it
to the tasting tonight.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.939
Because
you and I

14:34.941 --> 14:37.942
Are set to review the plans
for that new reliquary.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.111
Mary:
Oh.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.579
Uh, those plans aren't ready

14:41.581 --> 14:43.248
For us to review
just yet.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.482
And in any case,

14:44.484 --> 14:46.017
I will be spending the night

14:46.019 --> 14:47.318
At the abbey of saint seraphina.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.153
So your night
is free.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.523
Completely free,
as I'm sure you are aware.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.960
Are you certain, mary?

14:55.962 --> 14:58.229
I am.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.677
It's a long ride
to the warming lodge

15:12.679 --> 15:14.212
Where we're meeting my agent.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.580
Are you ready?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.048
Is there an explanation
for your absence?
Yes.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.416
There's nothing holding us back.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.931
I need to choose
a safe harbor to land

15:32.933 --> 15:35.233
In a region firmly
under catholic control,

15:35.235 --> 15:37.335
So that as I move my
small fighting force

15:37.337 --> 15:39.103
Across the countryside,
it only grows.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.538
By the time I reach my enemies,

15:40.540 --> 15:43.007
I will have an army at my back.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.275
Can you find
this information for me?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.644
I can, majesty, given time.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.679
How much time?

15:47.681 --> 15:48.947
I'll need at least a week.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.114
Probably two, to be safe.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.249
Mary:
Then hurry, ridley.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.684
And thank you.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.560
Louis, it's happening.
It's finally happening.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.162
Do you know
what this means?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.697
I can move forward.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.966
We can move forward.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.734
I can unify
my country,

16:09.736 --> 16:11.703
And we can have
a place to be together.

16:11.705 --> 16:14.305
I want to
celebrate, too.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.641
When it's safe. We should
get you back to the castle.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.142
But why?

16:19.244 --> 16:22.180
No one knows we're here.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.115
And we are alone.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.651
Mary, we needn't rush anything.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.720
You have never rushed me.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.322
And you have always
been by my side.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.992
I feel safe with you.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.518
Lords and ladies,
we are gathered tonight

17:00.520 --> 17:03.121
To commemorate
a most special vintage,

17:03.123 --> 17:04.522
Bottled to commemorate the birth

17:04.524 --> 17:06.090
Of a most special dauphin.

17:06.092 --> 17:11.195
Please, join me in toasting
king francis.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.364
Group:
Cheers!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.700
(various toasts continue)

17:15.702 --> 17:17.635
Sample the vintage
and you'll note the many ways

17:17.637 --> 17:19.370
It is like our fine, young king.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.506
It is elegant,
understated, yet bold...

17:21.508 --> 17:23.074
Catherine:
All these young ladies

17:23.076 --> 17:24.442
Hoping to catch
the king's eye...

17:24.444 --> 17:25.676
Why not you?

17:25.678 --> 17:28.212
Is that what you were
hinting at earlier?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.515
To answer your question:

17:30.517 --> 17:32.183
Because I am mary's lady.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.584
Mm-hmm.
And friend.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.319
Also, you despise me.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.322
Why are you looking
at me that way?

17:38.324 --> 17:40.291
Because you're the mother
of my son's child.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.527
You have given francis
something that mary hasn't

17:42.529 --> 17:43.728
And probably
never will.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.596
And he likes you.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.068
You could make
him very happy.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.536
What more could a mother want
for her son?

17:55.507 --> 17:57.642
Kenna.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.243
Bash.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.412
I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.847
I've decided it's far past time

18:02.849 --> 18:04.315
That I danced
with my wife.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.827
I'm sorry.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.129
Bash, you don't need to...
Yes, I do.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.664
If you think our marriage
is so far gone

18:19.666 --> 18:21.299
It's not even worth discussing,

18:21.301 --> 18:23.434
I must have done
something wrong.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.170
I know I work too hard.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.839
When I am around,

18:27.841 --> 18:30.541
I'm either distracted
or in a bad mood.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.310
But I don't want that
to be our relationship.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.712
So I had a thought.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.747
Let's go to paris.
Paris?

18:36.749 --> 18:39.217
Why?
You love paris.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.452
But you hate it.
I will love it for you.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.221
I used to know how
to make you happy.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.623
I want to be that husband again.

18:49.161 --> 18:51.462
What do you think?

18:51.464 --> 18:54.265
I don't know what to say.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.468
Francis...

18:57.470 --> 18:59.170
Have you
seen mary?

18:59.172 --> 19:01.572
She told me that she planned
on spending the evening

19:01.574 --> 19:03.207
At the abbey of saint seraphina.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.882
How we used to dance
at these parties,

19:10.884 --> 19:13.751
And now she can barely stand
to be near me.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.188
Or in the same castle,
apparently.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.391
I'm sorry to interrupt,

19:20.393 --> 19:23.227
But my uncle sent me
to give you a private message.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.695
Something he's learned
of one of the lords.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.297
Of course.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.933
Excuse me.

19:33.438 --> 19:34.639
What's this message

19:34.641 --> 19:36.807
That's so important?

19:42.548 --> 19:44.949
I'm sorry, majesty.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.918
There is no message.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.719
All that wine,

19:48.721 --> 19:50.521
And the look of you, I just...

19:50.523 --> 19:52.423
Is this your choosing
or has someone pressured you?

19:52.425 --> 19:53.958
Your uncle,

19:53.960 --> 19:55.626
Lord narcisse,
for example?

19:55.628 --> 19:56.827
He encouraged it.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.329
Ah.
But when I saw you...

19:58.331 --> 19:59.730
The choice is mine.

20:05.337 --> 20:06.871
Is that what he told you to say?

20:08.807 --> 20:11.275
Lady amelie,
I offer you nothing.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.743
If I were you,

20:12.745 --> 20:14.245
I would leave.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.813
But you're not me, are you?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.683
You're not a girl
who's spent all her life

20:18.685 --> 20:20.751
Watching a handsome young prince

20:20.753 --> 20:22.353
Become a king.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.297
You may not offer me anything,

20:33.299 --> 20:35.800
But you wouldn't be taking
anything from me, either.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.568
I've lain with
other boys,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.837
But never a man like you.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.672
And as to
your marriage...

20:41.674 --> 20:43.975
I've learned to live

20:43.977 --> 20:45.643
With wanting things
I can't have.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.612
Oh, that's a lesson
I'd like to learn.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.281
â™ª oh

20:50.283 --> 20:52.683
â™ª don't leave me here alone

20:52.685 --> 20:55.253
â™ª don't tell me
how we've grown â™ª

20:55.255 --> 20:58.389
â™ª for having loved
a little while â™ª

20:58.391 --> 21:00.524
â™ª oh

21:00.526 --> 21:02.927
â™ª I don't want to be alone

21:02.929 --> 21:05.663
â™ª I want to find a home

21:05.665 --> 21:08.466
â™ª and I want to share it
with you â™ª

21:10.335 --> 21:12.837
I'm all right.

21:12.839 --> 21:16.674
â™ª hello, my own heart

21:16.676 --> 21:18.609
â™ª it's been so long

21:18.611 --> 21:22.546
â™ª since I've given you away

21:22.548 --> 21:27.885
â™ª and every day
I add another stone â™ª

21:27.887 --> 21:30.421
â™ª to the walls
I built around you... â™ª

21:30.423 --> 21:32.423
Louis,

21:32.425 --> 21:34.292
I think...
It's enough for now.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.894
For now.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.839
Did I fall asleep?

21:52.778 --> 21:55.780
That was...

21:55.782 --> 21:57.848
You are talented.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.852
You were so
lost in it.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.524
Was that what
you wanted?

22:06.526 --> 22:09.727
To lose yourself?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.729
You are quite lovely,
lady amelie.

22:11.731 --> 22:12.863
Thank you.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.700
I have to go.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.001
Will you be all right?

22:27.679 --> 22:29.714
(gasps)

22:29.716 --> 22:31.015
(giggles)

22:31.017 --> 22:32.450
What was that for?

22:32.452 --> 22:33.884
Fun. What of it?
(gasps)

22:33.886 --> 22:35.686
That's enough of that.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.899
We've been seen.

22:53.972 --> 22:55.773
Who was that woman?
She saw us together.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.775
She could tell anyone--
it would mean our heads.

22:57.777 --> 22:58.809
She won't.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.077
Go back
to the castle.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.613
Wait for me there.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.981
Conde:
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

23:03.983 --> 23:05.549
Hyah!

23:10.021 --> 23:11.522
Conde:
Who are you?

23:11.524 --> 23:13.657
What is your business
in these parts?

23:19.431 --> 23:20.498
Antoine.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.766
You can't honestly
be surprised

23:21.768 --> 23:24.168
That I protected
my own interests.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.870
After you balked at your meeting
with elizabeth's envoy,

23:25.872 --> 23:28.105
I had you followed.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.173
You may go.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.042
And don't worry--

23:32.044 --> 23:33.577
She's loyal to me.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.645
Your secret's safe.

23:34.647 --> 23:35.946
For now.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.715
Is that a threat?

23:37.717 --> 23:39.617
You're jeopardizing your future,
our family's future.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.018
You must end your affair
with mary.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.153
I will not.

23:42.155 --> 23:43.721
You will do
what your family needs.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.423
Or I will tell francis
all that I know

23:45.425 --> 23:46.657
Of you and his wife.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.659
He will cut off
my head, antoine.

23:48.661 --> 23:49.860
Who will get you
elizabeth then?

23:49.862 --> 23:51.862
Well, you won't help me now.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.864
Why should I think you'll help
me if I let you live?

23:53.866 --> 23:56.100
And remember, if the nobles
learn of the affair,

23:56.102 --> 23:59.170
The law demands
mary's head, too.

23:59.172 --> 24:02.440
Will you risk mary's life
for a few nights of passion?

24:02.442 --> 24:03.707
You have two hours.

24:03.709 --> 24:06.811
End it with mary,
or I will end both of you.

24:10.882 --> 24:13.551
Well, you couldn't be with him
when he was a kitchen servant

24:13.553 --> 24:14.852
And you were
a queen's lady.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.720
That I understand.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.122
But now it's different.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.957
He's an officer
of the kingsguard, and...

24:19.959 --> 24:21.459
I'm married.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.827
Now and forever.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.695
It's wrong and
scandalous.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.031
And you would be ruined.
Aren't you already?

24:27.033 --> 24:29.767
It's not the worst thing
in the world, is it?

24:31.002 --> 24:32.236
Is that your man now?

24:34.973 --> 24:37.675
Yes, but he's
not my man.

24:40.178 --> 24:41.745
You judge apples
by color.

24:41.747 --> 24:43.781
Also firmness.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.683
Like this one.

24:47.018 --> 24:48.018
Leith.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.153
What...

24:49.155 --> 24:50.588
What are you doing here?

24:50.590 --> 24:51.889
I wanted to offer
my friendship.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.124
If you should ever need
help with anything--

24:54.126 --> 24:56.660
Companionship,
rent money,

24:56.662 --> 24:59.864
Produce selection...
Anything.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.031
I know you're cut
off from the castle,

25:01.033 --> 25:02.199
But you're never
cut off from me.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.901
That's truly kind.

25:03.903 --> 25:07.238
I'm sorry I dismissed you
so abruptly before.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.008
I guess I was overcome
by pride-- foolish pride.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.943
Hands off, pig!

25:12.945 --> 25:14.912
I don't owe you
no poke or no tug.

25:14.914 --> 25:15.980
Man:
Shut up!

25:18.517 --> 25:21.519
You heard the girl--
take your hands off her.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.287
Don't make me waste
another perfectly good apple.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.288
They're very expensive.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.756
Leave us alone!

25:25.758 --> 25:27.124
Be a gentleman, sir,

25:27.126 --> 25:28.292
And let go of her.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.528
I said it's none
of your business.

25:32.697 --> 25:33.931
Actually, it is
my business.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.133
Gigi is my neighbor,
my friend and...

25:36.135 --> 25:38.102
You mean she's
one of your whores?

25:38.104 --> 25:40.838
I've seen you pocket
your take from them.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.573
You tell your whore
she ain't done her job,

25:42.575 --> 25:44.775
And I want what's mine,
one way or another.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.978
You'll step away from gigi now,
or everyone here will understand

25:47.980 --> 25:49.980
Why the working girls
call you "old shrivel."

25:50.982 --> 25:52.149
Would you like that, sir?

25:52.151 --> 25:54.852
(laughter)

25:54.854 --> 25:56.320
Who needs you?

25:56.322 --> 25:58.289
Out of my way.
You all right?

25:58.291 --> 26:00.190
Thank you.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.159
You showed him, greer.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.978
Did you find the woman?

26:20.980 --> 26:23.180
She led me straight to
the man she works for.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.182
The man who sent
her to follow me.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.684
Follow you?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.118
Who was it? Francis?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.353
My brother.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.121
Antoine knows about us?

26:31.123 --> 26:33.123
About scotland?

26:33.125 --> 26:34.959
Nothing of
scotland, not yet.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.961
Why would he have
you followed?

26:36.963 --> 26:38.696
Does he suspect you
of something?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.197
Is-is there some issue
between the two of you?

26:40.199 --> 26:41.732
My brother
seeks advantage

26:41.734 --> 26:43.233
Whenever he can.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.735
And now he has it.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.337
Mary, we need
to reconsider our plans--

26:46.339 --> 26:47.338
Scotland, all of it.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.006
Why?

26:49.008 --> 26:51.742
Antoine said that
if we don't break it off,

26:51.744 --> 26:53.143
He'll tell francis
what he knows.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.745
It would cost you your head.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.614
Why would he risk your
life to keep us apart?

26:56.616 --> 26:58.682
I... I don't know.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.185
Then we must face reality.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.355
We cannot be together,
not now.

27:04.357 --> 27:06.890
And as much as I want you,

27:06.892 --> 27:09.026
I will not risk your
life to be with you.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.161
I'm so sorry.

27:11.163 --> 27:15.165
I would have given anything
to go on the way we were.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.034
To join you in scotland.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.970
I know.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.685
Forgive me,
but you look ghastly.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.788
Yes, well, I've felt better.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.956
When I've had
more sleep.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.658
I saw you leave
the tasting last night

27:40.660 --> 27:41.792
With narcisse's niece.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.193
She came back hours later,
all smiles.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.195
And you never
came back at all.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.330
Lola, don't.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.232
Don't give up on her, francis.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.701
I know mary's
pushing you away,

27:50.703 --> 27:51.835
But given
what she's been through,

27:51.837 --> 27:52.970
It's what she needs to do.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.339
All she needs is time.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.341
You, you sound
exactly like me,

27:57.343 --> 27:59.343
And like me,
you're wrong.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.111
Mary doesn't
want time.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.981
What she wants
is condÃ©.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.716
No.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.918
No, she admitted it, lola.
She wants to be with him.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.187
I forbade it, of course. Can you
imagine what that was like?

28:10.189 --> 28:12.356
Telling my wife, after
all she's been through,

28:12.358 --> 28:14.058
That no, she cannot
have the one thing

28:14.060 --> 28:15.759
She believes will
make her happy.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.161
An affair that would
get her killed.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.163
Look, I know this must hurt.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.331
But if you can't dissuade mary
from this course,

28:21.333 --> 28:24.001
Then you owe it to her to do
what you can to protect her.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.469
As a king,
you can squash rumors,

28:25.471 --> 28:27.037
And if that fails,

28:27.039 --> 28:29.006
You can shield them
from the severest punishment.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.274
It is a betrayal.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.276
Do you think mary turns
to condÃ© to hurt you?

28:32.278 --> 28:34.978
She loves you.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.314
She does what she does because
she sees no other option.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.917
She's desperate to get past
her pain, to heal.

28:39.919 --> 28:43.253
So I should stand by, a king,

28:43.255 --> 28:46.123
And grant my wife free rein
to be with another man?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.958
I don't know, francis.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.294
It depends on how much
you love her.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.763
And how much
you want her to heal.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.499
And to heal yourself.

29:00.004 --> 29:02.773
Majesty, your queen has arrived,
and she bids that you join her.

29:02.775 --> 29:03.774
Jeanne?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.042
She's here? Since when?

29:05.044 --> 29:06.343
She arrived
a few minutes ago.

29:09.013 --> 29:10.881
(jeanne gasps)
antoine: Hurry.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.149
My wife needs a chair.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.383
Woman: Your grace.
Woman 2: My lady.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.785
Woman 3: Some water!
Man: Water!

29:14.787 --> 29:16.186
Antoine: Are you all
right, my darling?

29:23.294 --> 29:25.229
Give me one moment.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.801
Kenna, please stop.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.803
Listen.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.171
Whatever you think you may know,

29:34.173 --> 29:35.305
My wife is pregnant, yes,

29:35.307 --> 29:36.774
But she's still
very ill.

29:36.776 --> 29:37.808
That's why I sent for her--
I thought

29:37.810 --> 29:38.809
She might want to meet you...

29:38.811 --> 29:40.177
Enough!

29:40.179 --> 29:42.312
You didn't invite her. I did.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.948
I had to see this illness
of hers for myself.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.550
So you were testing my story.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.051
Bash was right.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.453
Your only intention
was vengeance

29:49.455 --> 29:51.188
On him for killing your brother.

29:51.190 --> 29:54.424
You never intended to marry
me, not for one moment.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.426
Just to bed me,

29:56.428 --> 29:58.095
To punish my husband.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.229
You're right.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.464
It began that way,

30:00.466 --> 30:01.932
But I do want you.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.333
As what?!

30:03.335 --> 30:05.836
I thought I'd convince you
to be my mistress.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.838
Because I'd be ruined.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.208
And... My husband humiliated.

30:11.210 --> 30:15.078
Well, I can't deny hoping
for that last bit.

30:15.080 --> 30:18.182
You judge me, but you don't
know who these people are.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.117
They've committed
atrocities.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.518
Murder by the thousands.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.387
They are rulers.
This is the price they pay.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.088
You can still
leave with me.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.491
I will love you
and make you happy.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.959
I am happy!

30:28.961 --> 30:30.894
And I love my husband.

30:33.865 --> 30:37.234
If my wife had arrived
gravely ill,

30:37.236 --> 30:38.602
You'd have left your husband.

30:38.604 --> 30:42.005
Your marriage is
already over.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.208
You just don't know it yet.

30:55.486 --> 30:57.421
Francis, we
need to talk.
I know.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.256
I was going to come and find you

30:59.258 --> 31:01.325
Once I could bring myself
to do it.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.361
I assume you're here
about condÃ©.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.263
In a way, yes.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.898
He is yours.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.033
You're free...

31:10.035 --> 31:12.069
To do as you please.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.605
I don't understand.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.874
What's changed?

31:18.610 --> 31:20.477
I cannot bear
to see you in pain.

31:20.479 --> 31:24.248
And I will not be the cause
of any more suffering.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.183
Even if your pain results
from being kept

31:26.185 --> 31:28.418
From another man
whom you desire.

31:28.420 --> 31:32.089
Francis...
It's best
that you don't interrupt.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.624
This is not easy or pleasant,

31:33.626 --> 31:35.559
And I'm not even sure
if it's wise.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.094
But if you sincerely believe

31:37.096 --> 31:39.329
That your best path
to healing is at his side,

31:39.331 --> 31:41.164
I will not stand in your way.

31:42.567 --> 31:46.570
You may remain at court
with condÃ© with my protection.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.139
Don't make me regret this, mary.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.308
For god's sake, be careful.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.043
Just don't be seen with him.

31:54.178 --> 31:56.480
I will protect you
as best I can,

31:56.482 --> 31:59.416
Silence any rumors I'm able to.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.485
But if there is ever proof...

32:01.487 --> 32:03.420
If we are caught
together, you mean.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.223
If there is a child.

32:10.295 --> 32:11.595
I'm sorry we've come to this.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.664
Mm.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.933
Well, it's as you
suggested months ago.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.303
Let us hope that this allows

32:19.305 --> 32:22.005
One of us to be happy at least.

32:40.191 --> 32:42.459
Ask for baron eduard at the
ball, and tell him you're

32:42.461 --> 32:44.962
Seeking his training in how to
become more skillful courtesans.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.030
That should flatter his ego.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.700
Teach us to be better whores?

32:49.702 --> 32:52.402
I like it.
Wish us luck.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.410
My, how the tables
have turned.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.146
Now it's you who fears
being seen with me.

33:03.148 --> 33:07.117
Greer, you all but announced
at that market that you are...

33:07.119 --> 33:09.353
A madam?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.488
I am, leith.
You must separate yourself

33:11.490 --> 33:12.756
From this trade,
from these women.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.358
I'm trapped

33:14.360 --> 33:16.994
In a marriage to a man
in prison for treason.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.295
I'm disgraced in the
eyes of the crown

33:18.297 --> 33:20.230
And most of this village.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.366
I have nothing
to offer any man.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.001
And little enough
to offer a friend.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.435
Except for the women
I'm helping.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.270
I can't give that up.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.172
Not even for your approval.

33:33.578 --> 33:36.513
It's a hard enough life without
seeing your disappointment.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.782
So I'll make it
easier on both of us

33:38.784 --> 33:41.318
And go elsewhere.

33:43.454 --> 33:46.256
â™ª I breathe in slow
to compose myself â™ª

33:46.258 --> 33:49.192
â™ª but the bleeding heart
I left on the shelf â™ª

33:49.194 --> 33:52.662
â™ª starts beating now,
beating half to death â™ª

33:52.664 --> 33:55.265
â™ª scared of the hole
in my head â™ª

33:55.267 --> 33:57.434
â™ª that's been making me sweat

33:57.436 --> 34:00.270
â™ª but it turns out

34:00.272 --> 34:03.073
â™ª that the world will turn

34:03.075 --> 34:06.543
â™ª and we'll grow, we'll learn

34:06.545 --> 34:08.545
â™ª how to be...
(door opens)

34:08.547 --> 34:11.148
I don't care what you do.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.683
I don't care what they say.
I want you.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.085
I want you.

34:15.087 --> 34:16.787
â™ª I don't want to look down

34:16.789 --> 34:20.424
â™ª I don't want us to break up
in the cloud... â™ª

34:20.426 --> 34:22.359
Don't.

34:22.361 --> 34:23.460
Don't stop.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.463
â™ª to stay with you now

34:27.765 --> 34:31.101
â™ª and this here now

34:31.103 --> 34:34.371
â™ª it's where we first had

34:34.373 --> 34:37.841
â™ª you and me

34:37.843 --> 34:41.078
â™ª let's be complete.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.821
I got word
that you were leaving.

34:50.823 --> 34:53.290
I'm finding this french
court extremely trying.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.226
I'd like to leave with at
least one prospect intact.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.694
Please tell me you've
ended things with mary,

34:57.696 --> 34:58.795
So I don't have to go back

34:58.797 --> 35:00.230
Inside and tell francis

35:00.232 --> 35:01.465
What you've been
doing with his wife.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.101
You told me
that blood, family...

35:04.103 --> 35:05.836
Is everything,
and I am your brother.

35:05.838 --> 35:08.738
I don't think
you'd risk my death.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.341
It is you who is taking
the risk, and for what?

35:11.343 --> 35:12.843
Love.

35:12.845 --> 35:15.212
Mary will never leave francis.

35:15.214 --> 35:18.115
She has a duty not only to
France, but to scotland.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.483
I don't need a lecture
on politics, antoine...

35:19.485 --> 35:20.650
Then on love.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.886
For theirs was
rumored to be great.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.355
If mary can turn away from
her husband after being married

35:25.357 --> 35:27.624
For less than a year,
then she is a fickle

35:27.626 --> 35:29.559
And foolish woman.

35:35.633 --> 35:39.302
That may have been your one
chance to harm a king and live.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.673
When this is over,

35:43.675 --> 35:45.909
You will be running
for your life.

35:45.911 --> 35:49.513
Having turned down the queen of
England, who will despise you,

35:49.515 --> 35:51.414
And been cast aside
by the queen of scots,

35:51.416 --> 35:53.550
Who will want you gone.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.219
Your parting will
happen slowly,

35:56.221 --> 35:59.656
By the way, as mary knows
you've risked your life.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.792
Oh, my guess is that she'll
inch back to her husband,

36:02.794 --> 36:05.529
Feeling guilty for
costing you your head.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.364
Because even mary knows

36:07.366 --> 36:09.799
That francis will find a
way to kill you for this.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.902
A knife in the back, perhaps.

36:11.904 --> 36:13.770
The valois way.

36:15.506 --> 36:18.875
Please... Be sensible, louis.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.744
Meet with elizabeth's envoy.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.547
Build a future
controlled by you,

36:23.549 --> 36:26.650
Not the changeable
heart of a woman.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.753
I have to go.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.421
I've left a parting gift

36:31.423 --> 36:33.790
For kenna and bash,
and soon I'll be

36:33.792 --> 36:35.892
Even less welcome
than I am now.

36:39.564 --> 36:40.830
Hyah!

36:47.838 --> 36:50.407
Bash, if you meant what you
said, and you'll take me

36:50.409 --> 36:51.841
To paris, then I would
like to go soon.

36:51.843 --> 36:52.976
Now, even.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.878
Someone left this letter
on my desk.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.581
It's addressed to the queen
of navarre, antoine's wife.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.916
It's an invitation
to the tasting.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.952
Written by you.

37:01.954 --> 37:05.655
Um... It must have been
dropped off here by a servant,

37:05.657 --> 37:07.324
After the queen presented it.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.659
Why did you invite her
in the first place?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.528
You write, "we do hope

37:11.530 --> 37:13.830
Your recent illness will not
prevent your attendance."

37:13.832 --> 37:15.599
What recent illness?

37:15.601 --> 37:17.867
Who told you the queen was sick?
Why was this left on my desk?

37:17.869 --> 37:19.869
Is it some kind
of coded message?

37:19.871 --> 37:21.671
Is this antoine's work?
Kenna, say something!

37:21.673 --> 37:24.341
Please stop!
Just stop!

37:25.610 --> 37:27.877
I'm so tired of all the lies.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.814
Of making you believe
I'm someone I'm not.

37:32.617 --> 37:34.751
He asked me to marry him, bash.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.686
He said he'd make me a queen.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.455
He was lying, of course.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.457
But I was ready to say yes.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.359
I wanted it.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.561
I wanted a different life.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.329
I wanted things you
could never give me.

37:46.331 --> 37:48.665
And never can.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.804
Then there is no reason
for me to be here.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.886
(door closes)

38:14.925 --> 38:17.494
(baby cooing)

38:26.937 --> 38:29.806
Look at that forehead.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.808
So smooth.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.677
Free of worry.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.545
Ah, I envy him of that.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.813
I do, too.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.318
I thought you'd
want to know that I...

38:41.320 --> 38:42.886
I took your advice.

38:44.088 --> 38:45.955
I let mary go.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.424
You did?

38:47.426 --> 38:48.758
I did.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.694
I hated it,
every moment of it.

38:50.696 --> 38:53.029
But now, somehow I...
I feel better.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.065
Awful, but better.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.101
You are a kind

38:58.103 --> 38:59.903
And selfless man.

39:01.572 --> 39:04.107
And you were right.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.909
As you so often are.

39:05.911 --> 39:09.879
Now that mary is free
to move on without me...

39:09.881 --> 39:13.383
I find that I'm free
to do the same.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.785
Lately I've found that...

39:15.787 --> 39:19.456
The only times that I feel truly
safe in this castle, untaxed,

39:19.458 --> 39:22.692
Unworried and... Peaceful

39:22.694 --> 39:23.960
As this lucky child here,

39:23.962 --> 39:26.563
Is when I'm with you.

39:28.065 --> 39:30.400
Francis, no.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.637
We both still love mary.

39:34.639 --> 39:35.739
(sighs)

39:35.741 --> 39:37.540
And who knows?

39:37.542 --> 39:40.510
When she finds the strength
to truly love again,

39:40.512 --> 39:43.613
You may find you're not as
free from her as you think.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.590
(knock at door)

39:53.592 --> 39:55.091
Louis, come in quickly.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.694
I got your summons.
I was worried.

39:57.696 --> 40:00.029
Francis has had
a change of heart.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.664
He's not going
to stand in our way.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.666
We have to be discreet,
of course, but...

40:03.668 --> 40:05.869
As soon as we go to scotland...
Well, there's no need to rush

40:05.871 --> 40:07.737
Our departure now.
We can be cautious.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.406
How cautious?

40:09.408 --> 40:10.707
Why?

40:10.709 --> 40:13.610
What if francis changes
his mind again?

40:13.612 --> 40:16.780
What if this promise
of safety here is fleeting?

40:16.782 --> 40:18.948
Francis has given this
much painful thought.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.784
He didn't make this
decision easily.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.185
Exactly!

40:22.187 --> 40:24.154
What man, what king, would
give another man his wife?

40:24.156 --> 40:25.688
Mary, we need
to get out of here.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.824
You do realize that
even in scotland,

40:27.826 --> 40:29.592
We would have to be discreet.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.860
Of course I understand that.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.796
But you would be queen
of your own nation.

40:32.798 --> 40:34.864
You would have some
additional freedom.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.100
Unless you're having second
thoughts of leaving at all.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.802
We are going to scotland.

40:38.804 --> 40:41.604
I am needed there, and
I want you at my side.

40:42.973 --> 40:44.774
I love you.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.445
How do you feel about francis?

40:48.447 --> 40:50.113
You don't think this

40:50.115 --> 40:52.215
Act of unprecedented
generosity

40:52.217 --> 40:54.751
Is a trick somehow?

40:54.753 --> 40:57.120
Francis has only ever
wanted to protect me.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.688
Because he loves you.

40:58.690 --> 40:59.889
Because he wants you back.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.991
He's doing this to win you back.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.460
I can hear you soften
toward him.

41:03.462 --> 41:07.230
You and I have
made plans together.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.566
And that hasn't changed.

41:09.568 --> 41:10.934
But we need to trust each other.

41:13.704 --> 41:16.239
Do we trust each other?

41:16.241 --> 41:18.107
All right.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.076
Of course, I trust you.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.690
She'll be pleased to hear
what you've told me today.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.725
A marriage alliance
like this would be

41:35.727 --> 41:37.093
A boon to her people...

41:37.095 --> 41:38.561
And yours.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.264
Please send her
my warmest personal regards.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.599
From what I've been told,

41:42.601 --> 41:44.133
There's no queen more beautiful,

41:44.135 --> 41:47.804
Gracious or wise than elizabeth.
