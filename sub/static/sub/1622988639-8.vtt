00:06.923 --> 00:08.508
[Jack] What do you want from me?

00:09.926 --> 00:11.511
-[grunting]
-[distorted speech]

00:11.594 --> 00:13.138
[Jack muffled] What are you doing here?

00:14.681 --> 00:16.057
[grunting]

00:16.141 --> 00:17.225
[gunshot]

00:17.308 --> 00:19.144
[breathes heavily]

00:29.320 --> 00:32.741
[theme music playing]

00:46.254 --> 00:47.172
Hi.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.758
I was just out on a hike.

00:51.009 --> 00:51.926
Which trail?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
Uh, Blue Creek.

00:54.054 --> 00:54.929
[Jack] Nice.

00:57.599 --> 01:01.728
All right. I know that you're not gonna
wanna talk to me about Brady, but--

01:01.811 --> 01:04.397
Do you really think he shot you?

01:04.481 --> 01:05.648
Yeah, I do.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.692
You remember him pulling the trigger?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.402
No, but he was there.

01:10.779 --> 01:14.157
Listen, Brie, he's not a good guy, okay?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.992
In what way?

01:16.076 --> 01:19.120
For one, he worked for an illegal grower,

01:19.204 --> 01:21.956
and it turns out his boss
was also in the fentanyl business.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.125
The only reason he's not in jail right now

01:24.209 --> 01:26.669
is because somebody
tipped his boss off about a raid.

01:28.963 --> 01:29.881
Wow.

01:31.925 --> 01:32.884
[scoffs]

01:34.552 --> 01:35.845
I sure know how to pick 'em.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.432
To be fair, Brady's good at showing people
what he wants them to see.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.060
Still, I'm an attorney.
It's my job to read people.

01:42.143 --> 01:46.022
Hey, look, I'm… I'm sorry
that I haven't been there for you.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.649
To pick out the men I date?

01:47.732 --> 01:48.942
I'm serious.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.527
Thanks, Jack.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.031
-I love you.
-I love you too.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.742
Hey, I was thinking,

01:57.826 --> 02:00.578
when Mel gets back from LA,
how about I make us all dinner?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.250
Come on. My cooking's not that bad.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.337
I, uh, ended things with Mel.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.965
Why? What happened?

02:12.757 --> 02:13.800
She wants a baby,

02:13.883 --> 02:16.594
and I don't feel I can
support two families right now.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.430
-You're in love with her.
-Yeah, that's why I did it.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.016
I don't wanna hurt her.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.312
But what if you could make it work?
Think about what you'd be missing out on!

02:26.396 --> 02:28.481
That's the thing.
I can't think about that.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.109
If I wanna do right by her,
I gotta be practical.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.237
Jack, relationships are built on emotions.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.200
If you go through life closed off, then,
you know, you're not really living at all.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.286
If you need an example, think about Dad.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.079
I'm not being closed off.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.915
I told Mel exactly how I felt.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.669
This is tearing me up,
but I'm doing the right thing.

02:49.752 --> 02:53.006
I don't want you to spend your life
regretting your decision.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.258
[Brie groans]

03:03.099 --> 03:03.975
[Muriel] Mmm.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.644
Oh yeah, these eggs are delicious.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.064
It's the only thing I know how to make
that doesn't involve a microwave.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.733
[Muriel chuckles]

03:11.816 --> 03:15.737
You know, really, cooking is not so hard
if you follow a recipe.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.657
My mother always used to say,
"If you can read, you can cook."

03:20.533 --> 03:22.535
Well, that's never been true for me.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.954
Oh, darn, I forgot the cream cheese.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.040
-I will be right back.
-[Muriel chuckles]

03:27.749 --> 03:29.334
[cell phone ringing]

03:29.417 --> 03:31.794
-Oh! Doc--
-[cell phone ringing]

03:32.378 --> 03:33.338
Oh my.

03:33.421 --> 03:37.091
[ringing continues]

03:38.176 --> 03:39.219
Hi, Hope!

03:39.302 --> 03:40.303
Muriel?

03:41.304 --> 03:44.057
I'm sorry, I was trying to reach Vernon.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.725
I must've dialed wrong.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.353
No, you have the right number.
He's in the kitchen.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.147
-I didn't want him to miss your call.
-How noble of you.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.523
-[door closes]
-Thank you.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.611
And by the way,
everyone is doing fine, including Lilly.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.280
-[Doc mouths]
-What do you mean, "including Lilly"?

04:00.406 --> 04:02.408
Uh… Hey there, Hope!

04:02.492 --> 04:04.827
Don't "hey there" me. What's going on?

04:04.911 --> 04:08.248
Well, I just invited Muriel over
for breakfast as a thank you.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.833
She's just been so helpful
these past few weeks.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.418
[sarcastically] I bet she has.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.004
So what did Muriel mean by "even Lilly"?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.840
Well-- Let me call you back
after breakfast.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.050
I won't be able to talk.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.844
I'm taking my aunt
to her cardiologist appointment.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.348
Okay, well, you call me
when you get back. Okay?

04:25.431 --> 04:26.432
-No--
-Love you.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.850
-Love you!
-Vernon!

04:29.352 --> 04:32.855
-[Doc sighs]
-I am so sorry. I thought she knew.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.900
I never in a million years
would've said a thing if I had known.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.737
Oh, well,
Lilly wanted to tell her in person.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.198
-Oh-- Oh!
-[Doc sighs]

04:42.282 --> 04:44.867
I just feel awful about this.
How am I gonna fix it?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.412
Well, it was an honest mistake.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.914
Don't worry about it.
I'll… I'll deal with Hope.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.000
Thank you for being so understanding.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.670
You have such a lovely way about you,

04:56.671 --> 04:59.716
and I am glad
that we have remained friends.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.261
-Me too.
-[cups clink]

05:06.306 --> 05:08.224
[Joey] That judge screwed me. [sighs]

05:08.308 --> 05:09.892
What am I gonna do?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.394
We're gonna figure it out.

05:11.477 --> 05:15.523
I'm not gonna be able to keep the house.
Home owner's insurance, utility bills.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.233
[Joey groans]

05:17.859 --> 05:20.486
Well, it's five o'clock somewhere.
Let's drink.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.613
[Joey sighs]

05:22.697 --> 05:25.575
-I mean, can you believe that judge?
-I know.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.202
It's gonna be okay.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.205
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You still have a career.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.375
I'm sorry. That sounded bitchy.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.252
No, you're fine, you're fine.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.212
It's just, you know,

05:38.296 --> 05:40.840
when I first got pregnant,
Bill gave me a choice.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.427
He said we'd hire a nanny,
and I could keep working,

05:44.510 --> 05:46.262
or I could be a full-time mom.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.473
And now he wants a divorce,

05:48.556 --> 05:52.143
and I feel like I am being punished
for choosing my children over my career.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.313
-How is that fair?
-That is not fair. It's not fair.

05:55.396 --> 05:58.900
What am I supposed to tell the kids?
This is the only home they've ever known.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.694
-You're gonna have to be strong for them.
-How?

06:02.820 --> 06:04.530
I love this house as much as they do.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.075
I know,
but it's not the house that matters.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.243
It's about what's inside.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.496
The important thing
is that you have each other.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.374
-Right?
-Yeah. You're right.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.376
I just--

06:17.293 --> 06:18.836
I feel like a failure.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.713
You're not a failure.

06:21.839 --> 06:25.426
You are an incredible mother
with a big heart.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.097
Who has no idea what she's doing.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.724
Most people have no idea
what they're doing.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.442
-Jack and I broke up last night.
-Oh, honey, what? What happened?

06:41.526 --> 06:43.027
[Mel breathes shakily]

06:43.111 --> 06:46.114
Telling him that I want a baby
was too much for him.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.616
Oh, he'll come around.

06:48.699 --> 06:52.036
No, I don't think he will.
He's… He was really overwhelmed.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.665
-What about you? How do you feel?
-I…

06:57.583 --> 06:59.127
I'm… I'm heartbroken.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.921
[sighs, gasps] I…

07:02.004 --> 07:04.298
I knew bringing it up might scare him off.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.800
[sniffles]

07:05.883 --> 07:07.009
And it did.

07:09.011 --> 07:09.846
You know,

07:10.763 --> 07:12.974
you don't need Jack to have a baby.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.604
[sighs] I'm just… I'm too exhausted
to start over with someone else.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.314
I just wanna be with Jack.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.607
I don't mean that.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.820
I mean, you and Mark,
you have two embryos left, right?

07:26.654 --> 07:28.739
-Yeah.
-So use them.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.243
Those… those were for Mark and I
to start a family.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.369
You still can.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.581
I can't raise a baby on my own.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.708
You wouldn't have to be by yourself.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.335
You could move back here.
We could help each other.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.338
I mean, the kids would love
to have a baby cousin.

07:44.422 --> 07:48.426
What if I have Mark's baby,
and it makes me miss him all over again?

07:48.509 --> 07:52.054
Or what if it ends up being
a beautiful way for him to live on?

-[Preacher] Hey, Lizzie.
-Hey!

08:50.488 --> 08:53.449
-Connie said you needed help today?
-Yeah, thanks for coming in.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.201
One of my servers called in sick,

08:55.284 --> 08:58.704
and Ricky's out of town,
but I guess you already knew that.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.705
Yeah.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.166
So, how about a hundred bucks?

09:02.250 --> 09:05.336
-Connie said it'd be a favor.
-No, I got you covered.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.420
Thanks.

So, what is all this?

09:09.048 --> 09:12.051
This is a Texas-style

09:12.134 --> 09:13.261
Cool.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.514
Inside, you'll be taking drink orders.
Outside, follow me.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.896
With the smoker, just make sure
the temperature stays at 225.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.189
If it starts to drop,

09:25.856 --> 09:28.276
just take a handful of these woodchips,

09:29.902 --> 09:32.196
and you sprinkle them in the firebox.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.907
You know I've never used
a smoker before, right?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.909
Oh, there is nothing to it.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.955
Although you might wanna put your hair up.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.041
-How do you think I lost mine?
-Really?

09:44.125 --> 09:46.210
[chuckles] Just messing with you.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.796
-[deadpan] Hilarious.
-[Preacher laughs]

09:51.257 --> 09:52.466
[sighs quietly]

09:53.718 --> 09:57.555
So Brady admitted to being in the bar
the night of the shooting?

09:57.638 --> 10:00.558
Well, yeah,
but only after I'd remembered it.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.642
Anything else?

10:01.726 --> 10:04.562
He was wearing a black hoodie.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.940
We were fighting about something.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.901
Do you remember a gun?

10:12.903 --> 10:13.821
No.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.282
That's all I got.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.868
Okay. It's a good start.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.995
So what happens now?

10:21.078 --> 10:24.248
Well, been trying to get a warrant
to search Brady's property.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.042
This might be enough to do it.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.255
All right. If I remember anything else,
I'll let you know.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.214
Yeah.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.718
Can I ask you something
that's not to do with the case?

10:35.801 --> 10:37.970
Yeah, sure.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.639
I don't know if it's cool or not.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.057
It's about Brie.

10:42.016 --> 10:42.850
What about her?

10:42.933 --> 10:46.145
-How would you feel if I asked her out?
-Don't you have a fiancée?

10:46.228 --> 10:50.358
Yeah, the long-distance thing
wasn't working for her, so…

10:51.525 --> 10:55.780
Oh, dude, I keep telling you, you don't
have to stick around here on my account.

10:55.863 --> 10:59.075
It was for the best.
Yeah. She wasn't the one.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.409
What makes you say that?

11:00.493 --> 11:04.872
Because she never looked at me
the way Mel looks at you.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.712
God, it feels so good to be riding again.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.549
You know, I've been thinking lately.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.427
-I never should've left.
-Left where?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.346
-Home.
-Why would you say that?

11:21.263 --> 11:24.809
Because if I had gone to Humboldt State
instead of San Francisco,

11:24.892 --> 11:27.061
I could've spent more time
with you and Dad.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.146
Sweetie, your dad and I
were so proud of you

11:29.230 --> 11:31.065
when you decided to go to San Francisco.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.818
In fact, your father bragged
to anyone who would listen

11:33.901 --> 11:36.070
that his little Tara
had become a big city girl.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.241
I should've come home after Dad died
instead of leaving you to handle the farm.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.785
I never wanted you
to give up your life for me.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.705
-And I still don't.
-I could've done more.

11:45.788 --> 11:49.709
Listen, I'm so grateful
that you're going to adopt Chloe.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.044
Well, that's without a question.
She's my sister.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.756
But you're taking on a huge responsibility
that's not of your own making,

11:56.382 --> 11:58.592
so I hope that when I'm no longer here--

11:58.676 --> 12:02.096
-Mom, don't talk like that.
-Just-- Let me finish, please.

12:03.764 --> 12:08.310
When I'm gone, I don't want you to think
that you have to stay in Virgin River

12:08.394 --> 12:11.689
because you feel obligated
to raise Chloe here, okay?

12:11.772 --> 12:14.150
I want you to live… [sighs]

12:14.817 --> 12:16.152
…wherever makes you happy.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.697
Okay.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.700
[Lilly] Let's go, buddy.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.623
Hey.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.126
You have five minutes.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.881
I didn't shoot Jack.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.674
He told me you're a drug dealer.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.844
So is it true?

12:43.971 --> 12:44.930
I, uh…

12:46.223 --> 12:48.309
I knew the grow-op wasn't legit,

12:48.392 --> 12:50.269
but I didn't know about the…

12:50.853 --> 12:53.230
[hushed] …fentanyl until later.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.734
All I was trying to do was make
a bunch of cash to get out of here.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.737
Well, if it was just about the money,
I guess that makes it okay.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.863
I know.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.448
I made a bad choice,

13:03.115 --> 13:04.533
but I didn't shoot Jack.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.952
I'm telling the truth.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.081
[Brady] I did go to see him.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.002
That night, at the bar.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.714
We got into an argument, and I left.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.801
That's the last time I saw him, I swear.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.763
-Why didn't you tell Mike that?
-He wouldn't have believed me.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.889
Why not?

13:27.389 --> 13:30.810
I have a history with Jack and Mike
that goes back to Iraq.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.937
So tell the sheriff.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.856
I have a record. [sighs]

13:36.524 --> 13:40.277
After I got back from my last tour,
I was drinking a lot,

13:40.361 --> 13:43.239
and I got into a bar fight
and was arrested,

13:43.322 --> 13:46.534
and because I had a loaded gun on me,
I did a year at county.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.579
You make it sound like it's no big deal.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.332
Listen, I deserved every day
of that sentence.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.668
I could've killed those guys.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.587
But I didn't shoot anyone.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.675
And as far as the drugs go,
that's… that's over.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.970
The lumber company is totally legit.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.347
Brie,

14:08.931 --> 14:12.434
I know I made a lot of bad choices,

14:13.936 --> 14:15.396
but I'm not the villain here.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.857
Hey.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.234
Do you believe me?

14:24.697 --> 14:25.823
Yeah.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.035
I believe that's what you think,

14:30.995 --> 14:34.999
but in my career, I've learned that people
are capable of justifying their actions

14:35.082 --> 14:36.917
no matter how reprehensible.

14:45.843 --> 14:46.927
[Tara sighs happily]

14:48.804 --> 14:49.638
[Muriel] Yoo-hoo!

14:51.348 --> 14:52.182
What?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.560
They double-booked themselves
for babysitting,

14:54.643 --> 14:56.395
and I didn't have the heart to say no.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.354
Tara!

14:57.438 --> 15:00.149
Now go, have fun with your friends.
I'll watch Chloe.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.275
Love you.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.443
Love you too.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.153
Come on.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.990
-[Lilly] Guys!
-Of course we brought the knitting!

15:08.073 --> 15:10.409
-[Lilly] I love you! Thank you.
-That's why we came.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.287
-Thank you so much for being here.
-Thank you.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.955
-You want some tea?
-Yeah.

15:28.385 --> 15:32.598
[phone rings out]

15:32.681 --> 15:34.808
Hi, this is Ricky. Please leave a message.

15:36.977 --> 15:37.895
[phone beeps]

15:43.817 --> 15:44.944
[sighs]

15:45.027 --> 15:49.281
Now, today you'll be tested on math,
verbal skills,

15:49.949 --> 15:51.951
and technical proficiency.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.994
Your results will determine

15:54.078 --> 15:58.749
if you are qualified to enlist in
the greatest military force in the world.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.962
You have three hours and 45 minutes
to complete the exam.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.005
Once it begins,

16:05.506 --> 16:07.675
you will not be permitted
to leave the room.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.136
Good luck.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.263
You may begin.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.602
[phone ringing]

16:19.937 --> 16:22.398
[woman] Santa Monica Care & Fertility,
how may I help?

16:25.359 --> 16:27.152
[Mark] Need a little help with that?

16:27.236 --> 16:28.112
Uh-uh.

16:28.946 --> 16:29.989
I got it.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.241
Why are you not doing this
at the nail place?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.159
Because… [exhales deeply]

16:34.243 --> 16:36.120
…my feet are too sensitive right now.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.497
[inhales]
I don't want anyone touching them.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.500
Let me do it for you.
With as little touching as possible.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.460
Oh yeah, you can do pedicures?

16:43.544 --> 16:47.715
-I know how to use a paintbrush. Yeah.
-Really-- Oh, it's very different paint.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.634
Okay. [chuckles]

16:51.468 --> 16:56.348
That's a lot of polish.
You need to wipe the brush on the bottle--

16:56.432 --> 16:57.433
Madam.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.144
Please let me focus on my art.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.065
Don't drip it on the carpet
'cause then we can't get it off.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.693
-Could you--
-We just bought the ca-- [sighs]

17:07.776 --> 17:08.736
Sorry.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.655
You've got me nervous now.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.287
That's actually pretty good.

17:19.747 --> 17:20.748
Wow.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.416
Thank you.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.835
-Quite welcome.
-[Mel chuckles]

17:28.380 --> 17:31.467
See? Good things happen
when you have a little faith.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.011
[woman] Miss Monroe?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.431
Dr. Benson's ready to see you.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.985
I'm retired now.
There's no way I should be this worn out.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.113
Well, your blood work
shows a deficiency in vitamin D,

17:53.197 --> 17:56.909
which is likely responsible
for your fatigue and your muscle soreness.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.827
[groans] Well, that's a relief.

17:59.620 --> 18:04.708
I am going to write you a prescription
for vitamin D3 supplement.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.170
We'll do a 30-day follow-up appointment
to track how you're doing.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.463
That all sounds fine.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.215
Now, tell me…

18:13.550 --> 18:15.427
how is retirement?

18:15.511 --> 18:16.720
[chuckles]

18:16.804 --> 18:19.056
Well, it's an adjustment.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.349
[cell phone ringing]

18:20.432 --> 18:21.350
Oh.

18:22.559 --> 18:23.435
Hope.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.395
Oh. Give her my best.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.815
I'll call you later
to schedule that follow-up.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.858
-Thank you.
-[phone ringing]

18:29.942 --> 18:30.984
[phone beeps]

18:31.068 --> 18:33.403
-Hello.
-So, what aren't you telling me?

18:33.487 --> 18:36.240
Whoa, now! Slow down.
Don't I even get a hello?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.283
Hello, Vernon. What aren't you telling me?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.577
Well, first, Kathleen says hello.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.955
And second,
how was Aunt Nancy's appointment?

18:43.038 --> 18:46.583
Tell Kathleen hello back,
and the cardiologist said

18:46.667 --> 18:49.253
Aunt Nancy's got the heart
of a 50-year-old.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.965
So, of course, she needled me about
my heart attack the entire ride home.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.175
Now, what's wrong with Lilly?

18:55.259 --> 18:58.011
Well, everything is fine right now,

18:58.095 --> 19:00.889
but Lilly has some news
she wants to share with you in person,

19:00.973 --> 19:03.851
but nothing that can't wait till next week
when you're back.

19:03.934 --> 19:07.646
Vernon! You're infuriating.
Why won't you tell me?

19:07.729 --> 19:10.149
Lilly specifically asked me not to.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.987
Hope, patience is a virtue for a reason.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.030
Finish your stay with Aunt Nancy,

19:17.114 --> 19:19.366
and you can visit Lilly
as soon as you're home.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.201
-[glass smashes]
-What was that?

19:21.285 --> 19:25.581
Aunt Nancy refused to wait for me
to help her with the dishwasher.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.208
I better go before I have
to drink out of paper cups.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.210
-No--
-We're not done talking about this.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.545
-I think--
-[phone beeps]

19:35.007 --> 19:36.341
[sighs]

19:38.427 --> 19:41.263
She won't tell you because
she doesn't want us to know her age!

19:41.346 --> 19:43.390
Oh! Connie, where have you been?

19:43.473 --> 19:44.975
Oh, I was helping Preacher out.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.477
Are you sure you're up
for this many visitors?

19:47.561 --> 19:50.522
-Oh yes! Of course! Have a seat!
-Oh. Okay.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.816
[Connie] So, what have I missed?

19:52.900 --> 19:57.779
Well, Muriel was just telling us
about the time she tried to seduce Buck.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.156
Come again?

19:59.239 --> 20:00.574
Okay. [sighs]

20:00.657 --> 20:03.160
Okay, this was a very long time ago,

20:03.243 --> 20:04.786
and I was new in town,

20:04.870 --> 20:07.331
and I ran into Buck at Jack's.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.167
How was I supposed to know he was married?

20:10.834 --> 20:13.670
-Well, Buck always wore a wedding ring.
-I'm not a detective.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.755
[laughing]

20:14.838 --> 20:16.381
I can't believe he never told me.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.593
I'm sure he thought
Muriel was just being friendly.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.054
Well, I always thought he was very sexy.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.890
-Lydie?
-[Lydie] What? I did.

20:24.973 --> 20:29.269
I'm a sucker for a ten-gallon hat
and a pair of cowboy boots.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.395
Well, who knew?

20:30.479 --> 20:34.191
[laughing]

20:34.775 --> 20:39.238
Wow. I am so, so grateful
y'all cleared your schedules

20:39.321 --> 20:40.614
to come here today.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.075
I've had such a beautiful life.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.785
You have a beautiful life.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.286
I've been truly blessed.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.373
I… I had a loving husband,

20:49.456 --> 20:54.086
and beautiful, healthy children. [sighs]

20:55.045 --> 21:00.676
Loyal friends, and the fortune to live in
one of the most beautiful places on earth.

21:00.759 --> 21:04.137
My only regret
is leaving Tara and Chloe behind.

21:04.721 --> 21:05.639
Oh, Lilly.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.267
When I'm gone,
no matter where they're living,

21:08.350 --> 21:12.354
I need each of you
to watch over Tara and Chloe for me

21:12.437 --> 21:14.231
because she's not gonna ask for help.

21:14.314 --> 21:18.068
And Chloe,
would you please tell her our stories

21:19.987 --> 21:24.783
and remind her over and over again
how much her mama loved her?

21:25.617 --> 21:27.786
-[Lilly] Please?
-[Jo Ellen] Oh, sweetheart.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.500
[Lilly cries] Oh!

21:33.583 --> 21:36.128
I just love all of you so much.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.462
[Lydie] We love you too.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.882
Thank you for being my friends.

21:51.935 --> 21:55.147
Dude, that barbecue was a great idea, man.

21:55.230 --> 21:59.276
-Thanks to you, we'll triple our receipts.
-Yeah, I'm glad it all worked out.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.654
Well, speaking of that, um,

22:03.613 --> 22:06.158
we still need to discuss the partnership.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.869
You sure? I don't want you
to feel pressured into it.

22:08.952 --> 22:12.956
No, no. Look, uh, I admit
when you first brought it up,

22:13.040 --> 22:15.208
I didn't really see it
from your point of view.

22:15.792 --> 22:21.089
Ah, well, no offense, but, you know,
you do that a lot. Not just with me.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.386
Right. Um… I'm sorry about that.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.721
[chuckles softly] Nah.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.390
But, hey, if you're still interested,

22:30.474 --> 22:33.018
the bottom line is the profits
aren't always consistent,

22:33.101 --> 22:36.480
so there's gonna be months
where you'll earn less than you do now,

22:36.563 --> 22:40.442
but if you're okay with that,
I mean, consider this an official offer.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.401
Huh.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.236
Wow. Um…

22:43.320 --> 22:46.281
[chuckles] It's not what I thought
you were gonna say,

22:46.990 --> 22:50.744
and I'd like some time to think about it,
if that's okay with you?

22:50.827 --> 22:53.413
Please, no, take whatever time you need.

22:55.999 --> 22:56.833
Cool.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.260
-Hey.
-Hey there.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.638
Are you sure you can't stay?

23:09.721 --> 23:14.184
Oh. I wish I could, but I told Doc
I would be back by tomorrow.

23:14.267 --> 23:17.396
Okay. Well, maybe the kids and I
can come visit you.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.563
I would love that.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.731
Okay. Yeah.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.901
So, hey, um, are you really
considering moving back?

23:22.984 --> 23:25.028
-I'm thinking about it.
-[Joey chuckles]

23:25.112 --> 23:29.616
Well, I don't mean to sound selfish,
but having you here would make me happy.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.869
I know.
I have to finish out my contract first.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.788
Oh, of course. Of course.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.291
I just wanted to say
thank you so much for coming.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.376
Honey.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.628
I couldn't have gotten through this
without you.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.088
Oh, sweetheart.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.257
I just-- [sniffles]

23:45.340 --> 23:47.551
-I'm sorry. I can't help it.
-It's okay.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.302
Just don't start crying

23:49.386 --> 23:51.471
because if you start to cry,
then I'll cry,

23:51.555 --> 23:55.684
and I don't have waterproof mascara on,
and it's gonna be a mess.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.311
I just-- I don't know how to do this.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.105
[cries] I don't know how to be alone.

24:00.188 --> 24:03.650
-Honey, you're not alone. You have me.
-You're really far away.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.111
I know, but anytime you need me,
you just call me,

24:06.194 --> 24:08.530
and I will hop on a plane,
and I'll be here. Okay?

24:08.613 --> 24:10.699
Okay. Okay.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.202
-I love you.
-Oh, I miss you already.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.836
Kinda slow around here, huh?

24:22.919 --> 24:25.213
Everyone came early for the barbecue,
I think.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.133
Preach left to pick up Christopher,
so I'm gonna close up soon.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.677
-All right, I'm finishing up.
-All right, no worries.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.142
[Brady] Well, well, well.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.895
Look who it is.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.356
Detective Mike Valenzuela.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.525
Brady, you're drunk. Go home.

24:46.109 --> 24:50.614
-You gotta be proud of yourself, huh?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

24:50.697 --> 24:56.995
Once again, I'm the bad guy,
and you… you're the hero.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.580
If the shoe fits.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.417
Well, that's the thing. [sighs]

25:03.418 --> 25:04.336
It doesn't.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.381
You see, I've paid for the crimes
I've committed.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.800
Can you say the same?

25:14.971 --> 25:16.223
[quietly] Don't go there.

25:16.723 --> 25:17.849
Why not, Mike?

25:18.517 --> 25:21.978
You afraid everyone's gonna find out
you're not such a hero after all?

25:24.523 --> 25:27.859
You know what?
I'm not the criminal around here. You are.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.320
[Brady] Hm.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.573
Well, I know what you did in Iraq, Mike.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.869
You got blood on your hands
just like everyone else.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.582
[grunting]

25:50.006 --> 25:51.007
[grunting]

25:51.091 --> 25:51.925
Hey, hey, hey!

25:52.676 --> 25:53.635
Hey, hey!

25:53.718 --> 25:55.095
Come on! Get out!

25:55.679 --> 25:56.763
[Brady] Get off me!

25:58.139 --> 25:59.307
[Jack] Get out of here!

26:01.560 --> 26:02.394
[groans]

26:02.477 --> 26:03.895
What was that about?

26:05.063 --> 26:07.190
Classic Brady. Nothing's ever his fault.

26:09.317 --> 26:10.527
[groans]

26:10.610 --> 26:13.446
I hope they lock him up
and throw away the key.

26:14.030 --> 26:14.948
[sighs]

26:16.575 --> 26:17.450
[glass slams]

26:21.788 --> 26:23.039
[woman 1] It's gorgeous.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.666
[woman 2] And huge.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.042
Thanks. [chuckles]

26:26.126 --> 26:29.379
Hey, honey. Sorry to interrupt.
Mind if I steal her for a moment?

26:31.006 --> 26:33.508
Charmaine, I'd love for you
to meet Thomas Blair,

26:33.592 --> 26:35.510
one of the largest real estate developers.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.970
Oh wow!

26:37.053 --> 26:40.807
And, Thomas,
this is my fiancée, Charmaine.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.726
Lovely to finally meet you.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.144
It's nice to meet you too.

26:44.227 --> 26:47.439
Would you keep her company for a minute?
I gotta catch up with someone.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.440
Okay.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.944
So, I hear we're going to be neighbors.

26:53.028 --> 26:53.945
Sorry?

26:54.029 --> 26:55.947
Todd says you two are moving to Eureka.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.909
He did? Um, sorry--

27:02.746 --> 27:05.040
Hey, so, we're moving to Eureka?

27:05.123 --> 27:06.666
Oh. Excuse us.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.210
Would you keep your voice down?

27:09.294 --> 27:12.881
What about your house in Clear River?
I thought we'd agreed to live there.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.801
-The house in Eureka is twice the size.
-But my life is in Clear River.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.429
I mean, my friends, the salon…

27:19.512 --> 27:21.431
So? You'll make new friends,

27:21.514 --> 27:25.185
and we'll find you another salon to run
if that's still what you wanna do.

27:26.394 --> 27:30.607
[scoffs] I just don't understand
why you changed your mind.

27:30.690 --> 27:35.028
Well, I have a feeling Jack's gonna try
to make our lives complicated.

27:35.111 --> 27:38.615
I figured once we moved to Eureka,
it'll be out of sight, out of mind.

27:38.698 --> 27:41.576
[scoffs] Jack's not gonna
give up the twins

27:41.660 --> 27:43.203
just because we moved to Eureka.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.121
Maybe, not at first.

27:46.039 --> 27:50.585
But if we make things difficult for him,
I believe, eventually, he'll back down,

27:51.628 --> 27:53.463
and then we'll have the freedom

27:53.546 --> 27:56.466
to raise our family
in whatever way we see fit.

27:57.967 --> 27:58.843
[Todd] Okay?

28:00.136 --> 28:00.970
Love you.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.266
-Gotta catch up with them. I'll be back.
-Okay.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.232
Hi, Charmaine.

28:16.945 --> 28:17.821
Well.

28:18.738 --> 28:22.784
120 over 70.
Very good. You're doing great.

28:26.830 --> 28:31.000
-How are things with you and Mel?
-That's not so great. [sighs]

28:31.584 --> 28:33.545
-What happened?
-I broke it off.

28:35.380 --> 28:40.343
She wants to have a baby of her own,
and I'm not 100% sure I can give her that.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.181
But you love her.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.683
Of course I do.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.562
[Doc] You know what, um,

28:50.645 --> 28:55.191
unsolicited advice
is usually Hope's arena, but, uh…

28:57.193 --> 28:59.070
for you, I'm gonna make an exception.

28:59.904 --> 29:05.410
Mel is a self-sufficient, strong-willed,

29:05.493 --> 29:08.788
extremely capable woman

29:10.039 --> 29:12.417
who happens to have a very big heart

29:13.460 --> 29:18.590
right in the center of her…
her tough exterior.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.342
She's not someone who's fragile.

29:21.426 --> 29:25.889
She's not someone who has been shielded
from life's hardships.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.725
And if you have been transparent
with her--

29:28.808 --> 29:29.642
I have.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.936
She knows exactly what she's getting into.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.398
She would not go forward
if she didn't think she could handle it.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.193
And you think
you might need to protect her?

29:39.486 --> 29:41.696
That's not what she needs.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.657
That's not what she wants.

29:46.159 --> 29:50.079
I think it would be a tragedy for you
to go through your life alone

29:50.163 --> 29:52.707
because of a misguided perception

29:53.917 --> 29:56.169
of the woman you love.

30:01.424 --> 30:07.347
You know, I don't ever recall you
stringing that many words together.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.433
Ever. [chuckles]

30:10.517 --> 30:12.018
I do say my piece…

30:13.728 --> 30:14.771
[sighs]

30:15.563 --> 30:17.315
…when it's absolutely necessary.

30:17.899 --> 30:18.858
[Doc sighs]

30:32.163 --> 30:33.665
[sighs]

30:35.291 --> 30:37.544
[hairdryer whirs]

30:40.338 --> 30:42.298
-[knocking at door]
-Come in!

30:45.468 --> 30:48.638
Connie let me in,
and she didn't even give me a hard time,

30:48.721 --> 30:50.306
which is weird.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.979
So, what'd you do today?

30:57.188 --> 31:00.358
I, uh, hung out with my grandma.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.403
That's nice. Did you go anywhere?

31:03.486 --> 31:07.949
We went to Clear River. Walked around.

31:08.032 --> 31:08.992
Hm.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.244
I tried to call you.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.954
Uh, my phone died.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.581
Uh-huh.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.544
So, what did you do today?

31:19.627 --> 31:20.712
Well,

31:22.255 --> 31:23.965
I washed my hair three times.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.093
Do you know why
I had to wash my hair three times?

31:28.136 --> 31:29.137
No.

31:30.346 --> 31:34.559
Because I covered your shift at the bar,
and my hair reeked of smoke and brisket.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.479
You, uh, covered my shift?

31:38.563 --> 31:41.107
Preacher said you were out of town
visiting a friend,

31:41.190 --> 31:43.067
so he asked Connie if I could fill in.

31:44.485 --> 31:45.862
[exhales] Um…

31:49.574 --> 31:50.783
Can I ask you something?

31:52.243 --> 31:54.203
Which one of us are you lying to?

31:54.287 --> 31:55.163
I…

31:58.666 --> 31:59.709
That's what I thought.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.211
Just go.

32:03.630 --> 32:04.505
Leave.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.855
-[Tara] Here you go.
-Oh, thank you, darling.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.774
You're welcome.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.652
-How long's Chloe been asleep?
-[Tara] Over an hour.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.820
-Wow.
-The ladies must've wiped her out.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.073
-Oh yeah. [chuckles]
-[knocking at door]

32:30.573 --> 32:31.532
I'll get it.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.789
-Doc!
-Hello there!

32:37.872 --> 32:39.916
Hey, I'm sorry to drop in unannounced.

32:39.999 --> 32:43.461
-Not a problem. Always happy to see you.
-Do you want a cup of coffee or tea?

32:43.544 --> 32:46.047
I would love a cup of coffee.
Black, please.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.299
-Great, sure, I'll be right back!
-Yeah.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.592
What did Hope say?

32:50.259 --> 32:52.804
How did you know that's why I was here?

32:52.887 --> 32:57.600
Because I've had half a dozen messages
demanding that I call her back.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.687
And? Did you?

33:00.770 --> 33:01.646
Not yet.

33:02.313 --> 33:05.984
Well, she has gotten wind
that something is amiss with you.

33:06.067 --> 33:10.238
-Does she know about my cancer?
-No, but she knows something's wrong.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.823
I did my best to hold her off,

33:11.906 --> 33:16.035
but next week
when she steps off that plane,

33:16.119 --> 33:19.497
I suspect she's gonna show up here
asking questions,

33:19.580 --> 33:21.290
and I just wanna give you a heads-up,

33:21.374 --> 33:24.585
and I want you to know
that I kept your confidence.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.421
Yeah, thank you.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.051
I've been driving myself crazy
trying to figure out how to tell her.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.886
If I call her back,

33:33.970 --> 33:36.848
you know, she's gonna drop everything
and come home,

33:36.931 --> 33:38.808
and if I keep waiting,

33:38.891 --> 33:41.978
I'm afraid she's gonna be angry at me
for keeping her in the dark.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.855
Well, so what if she's upset?

33:43.938 --> 33:45.398
How can you say that?

33:45.481 --> 33:46.524
Lilly.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.360
-Lilly.
-What?

33:50.278 --> 33:51.821
You are the one who is sick.

33:51.904 --> 33:55.116
You don't owe Hope or anybody else
a medical report.

33:55.199 --> 33:59.787
You cannot sap your energy
worrying about what other people think.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.790
She's not "other people."
She's my best friend.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.251
That's exactly why she'll understand.

34:05.334 --> 34:08.296
She loves you. She wants the best for you.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.091
She's been so good to me.

34:12.675 --> 34:13.509
Yeah.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.722
Listen, if you want me to,
I could talk to her first.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.683
-I'm gonna think about it. Okay?
-Okay.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.560
Thank you. Hey!

34:22.643 --> 34:24.103
-[Doc] Oh!
-Coffee.

34:24.187 --> 34:27.398
Thank you. I'll just drink this
and get out of your hair.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.943
Oh, no, nonsense!
I'd like you to stay for dinner.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.863
-No, I don't wanna put you out.
-No, Doc, we want you to stay.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.740
Okay, you don't have to twist my arm.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.200
[laughing]

34:37.283 --> 34:39.368
Well, then it's settled. Okay.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.163
I think I'm gonna just have
a little catnap.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.792
Why don't you take your coffee,
go sit out on the porch?

34:45.875 --> 34:48.169
-Beautiful out there.
-I'll take you up on that.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.339
-It smells delicious.
-[Tara] Mm.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.595
Is it wishful thinking,
or does she seem better to you?

34:59.514 --> 35:00.431
She looks good.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.225
-That's what I think.
-Yeah.

35:02.308 --> 35:08.022
You know, I've been praying for a miracle,
and maybe it's working.

35:09.690 --> 35:10.691
[softly] Yeah.

I should've had more faith in you.
I get that.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.593
I just got overwhelmed.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.055
I let anxiety get the best of me.

I acted out of fear. That is not who I am.

get harder, you know?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.625
How are you gonna react then?

is worth fighting for.

I swear I will spend the rest of my life
fighting to make you happy.

Jack, you walked away from me.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.403
No, Mel, please. Look.
