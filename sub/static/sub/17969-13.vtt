WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:11.345
Where is she?

00:12.846 --> 00:15.190
Lost! Forever!

00:22.022 --> 00:24.059
Do you think I
haven't been tortured before?

00:24.224 --> 00:27.398
I've seen more pain
than you can possibly imagine.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.042
I have a good imagination.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.409
Now, where is she?
You tell me where she is

00:37.571 --> 00:41.212
or I will board up this door
and this room becomes your eternity.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.219
Do what you may.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.051
I fear you less
than the people I work for.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.557
I know all about ilaria.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.889
When they find you,

00:52.252 --> 00:55.563
they will force you to watch
<i>as</i> they kill everyone you love.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.230
Not if I find them first.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.565
You will not.

01:00.727 --> 01:04.072
You contacted your military,
the FBI,

01:04.230 --> 01:06.233
even Interpol for help,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.073
but no one believed you.

01:08.235 --> 01:12.684
Ilaria is everywhere
while you hide in the shadows.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.418
Go ahead.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.617
All I have is time,

01:22.015 --> 01:24.256
unlike you.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.106
Where is she, you son of a bitch?

01:40.267 --> 01:43.441
You know, I think I finally see
the family resemblance.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.108
You favor your
mother over Hiroshi.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.116
Tell me where she is now.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.118
She's not much
to look at these days.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.814
Thirty years in a cell
can take quite a brutish toll.

01:52.980 --> 01:56.120
So help me, I'll kill you where you
sit if you don't start talking.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.160
A killer? Jules.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.492
Maybe you are
like your father after all.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.463
Hey, hey, hey-

02:10.797 --> 02:13.141
We will get your mother back,
but not like this.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.302
Shes here, Alan,
somewhere on this base.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.142
And we will find her,

02:17.304 --> 02:19.807
but we can't act like they do.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.008
He cut off my...

02:21.174 --> 02:23.984
If we sink to their level,
we're no better than they are.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.023
I don't wanna be better.
I want my mother back.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.507
I am so sorry.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.003
Would you like to be alone?
No.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.062
Why did he do it?

03:05.852 --> 03:08.526
Sacrifice himself for me?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.532
Because he knew

03:11.892 --> 03:15.032
that I would have made
the same choice.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.239
But he grew up here with you.
You hardly know me.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.347
You are my daughter.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.082
My flesh and blood.

03:28.709 --> 03:34.887
No matter how much you hate
me, nothing can change that.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
I don't hate you.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.440
I just want to understand.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.010
Why didn't you tell me
my mother was still alive?

03:55.936 --> 03:58.007
I thought...

03:59.106 --> 04:03.248
it would only give you
false hope...

04:05.112 --> 04:08.093
and put you in grave danger.

04:15.122 --> 04:21.437
I didn't want to fail you
as I failed her.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.472
How did you fail her?

04:24.798 --> 04:31.272
By allowing ilaria to take her,
to use her against me.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.987
That's why you created
the Narvik for ilaria?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.922
To keep her alive?

04:41.615 --> 04:44.459
I had no other choice.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.623
You were protecting me too.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.493
That's why you
never revealed yourself.

04:56.463 --> 05:00.809
They would have hunted you
to the ends of the Earth.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.844
As they now will.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.357
That's the missing snowmobile.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.236
It's been snowing
for four hours.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.067
There's no tracks.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.871
Sergio has to be somewhere.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.706
Look around you.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.712
Somewhere is a pretty big place.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.381
He's not gonna last the day out here.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.047
I thought he was supposed to be
some badass Special Ops type.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.887
He's from Brazil.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.256
We need to face reality.

06:25.418 --> 06:26.590
He might already be dead.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.058
No. I won't accept that.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.728
We gotta keep looking.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.561
The others are waiting.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.403
If we keep looking, then we
might die out here with him.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.576
Just 10 more steps.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.454
Ten more steps.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.594
Ten more steps.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.940
<i>I know that there's
been</i> a <i>lot of uncertainty,</i>

07:13.099 --> 07:16.603
but I want you all to know that
you are perfectly safe down here.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.305
I'll only be gone an hour.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.381
Dr. Jordan.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.615
You're the one keeping us
from losing our heads.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.887
If you leave, it will start a panic.
They can panic all they want.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.621
I have to find Alan now.
He told us to stay down here.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.666
No, Alan needs to know
that Daniel took the canisters.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.825
You have the cure.
What does that matter?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.994
He took both canisters,
virus and cure.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.307
I don't have to explain to you what
that means if it gets out. Ahem.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.639
What's wrong? Are you sick?
No, I'm fine.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.908
You're white. With everything that
happened, you need a blood test.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.813
Since when are you concerned
about my well-being?

07:56.242 --> 07:59.348
I'm truly sorry
about what happened before.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.525
I panicked.
Let me make it up to you.

08:03.683 --> 08:07.153
My lab is just upstairs.
The test will only take a moment.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.167
Hey, back for another go-around?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.172
Beating on a helpless boy?

08:18.331 --> 08:22.336
You're not helpless.
You're not a boy, from what I hear.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.540
Hm. Hiroshi's been
telling tall tales.

08:25.705 --> 08:28.015
I'll have to remedy that
once I'm back at ilaria.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.882
Who says you're going back?
Maybe we send pieces of you.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.682
That's enough.
Why?

08:32.846 --> 08:36.953
After what he did to Julia?
Torture gets us nowhere. All right?

08:37.116 --> 08:40.530
Ha-ha-ha. I mean, what is this?
Good scientist, bad scientist?

08:40.953 --> 08:42.695
Here's how this will work.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.529
You will contact your cohort

08:44.691 --> 08:47.194
and arrange to have
Julia's mother returned to us.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.567
And only then
will we let you go.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.709
Total surrender?

08:52.399 --> 08:56.040
Yeah, see, that is quite tempting,
but let me give you the full view.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.572
You've already lost.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.548
We have the virus

09:00.707 --> 09:02.050
and we have the cure.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.710
Oh, do you, now?

09:04.411 --> 09:05.890
Have you not seen the news?

09:06.312 --> 09:07.552
What news?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.559
The download's a couple
days old, but have at it.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.062
What are we looking at?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.227
My Spanish is rusty,

09:17.390 --> 09:20.234
but there's been an outbreak
of an unknown viral illness

09:20.760 --> 09:22.239
in Lares, Puerto Rico.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.931
Jesus.

09:24.898 --> 09:29.506
Hundreds sick,
an untold number dead.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.743
And they're calling it
<i>sangre negra.</i>

09:31.905 --> 09:33.407
Black blood.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.218
It looks like Narvik, but how the
hell did it get off the base?

09:45.785 --> 09:47.628
Balleseros.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.507
This is the turnoff to Nunavut.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.807
I know where we are, Tulok.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.644
Then you know
we gotta get moving.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.150
We can't spend
the night out here.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.852
- He's alive. I know it.
- He's only one man.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.825
Ilaria will hunt us all down.

10:53.486 --> 10:57.332
Tulok, you know why our ancestors
built the inuksuk?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.832
As a marker to show us our way.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.166
But also to remind us

11:02.328 --> 11:05.332
that we're never alone
in such a lonely place.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.539
Yeah, that and we needed a stop sign.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.509
Well, how am I supposed
to just leave him out here?

11:16.442 --> 11:18.513
He made his choice.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.692
You need to honor that.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.380
Hello, Sergio.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.076
Blake. What an unpleasant surprise.

11:49.242 --> 11:53.713
Likewise. Imagine my dismay when you
popped up on the base perimeter cam.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.595
You saved me?
Against my better judgment, but yes.

11:59.752 --> 12:03.222
Although I was tempted to
leave you out alone and forsaken

12:03.389 --> 12:05.164
just so you'd know how it felt.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.769
I meant to call you.
Spare me.

12:06.926 --> 12:10.066
The only reason you're here is
because I could use the backup.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.741
I thought the Scythe
only worked on the down-low.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.402
He's indisposed at the moment,

12:15.568 --> 12:18.276
courtesy of Hatake and
your friends from the CDC.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.247
He's a prisoner?
He's exactly where he wants to be.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.514
Virus and cure.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.923
You've got the
Narvik virus and cure

12:29.749 --> 12:30.750
right here?

12:31.451 --> 12:33.431
Only thing left to do is close out.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.462
The camera's off-line. That ought
to keep them from listening in.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.438
This is unspeakable.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.443
Are you sure it wasn't an accident?
No, that was a test run.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.447
Lares is isolated.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.447
It's the perfect sample size
to see how the virus behaves

12:53.606 --> 12:54.880
in a given population.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.783
There are no reports of vectors,
so it must be Narvik-A.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.783
I know a little bit
about this, okay?

13:05.151 --> 13:08.462
Peter's right.
Which means we can contain it.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.830
But only if we are able
to retrieve the cure.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.801
And my mother.
Yes, along with Jane.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.899
Well, we know they're watching us.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.304
Where's the best place
to hack into the camera?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.002
The security room on Level G.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.178
They must have set up
a base of operations.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.319
There is only one entrance.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.476
If we access the subfloor,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.647
I might be able to recalibrate
the air filtration system

13:33.813 --> 13:35.486
and flood the room with CS gas.

13:35.648 --> 13:39.152
Or we could use our chips
to gain access and go in armed.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.831
I like that idea.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.336
I'm in.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.668
No, no. We need somebody
to watch after the teenager.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.334
Great. Babysitting duty.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.844
Many have taken Spencer lightly.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.846
Few have lived to talk about it.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.343
Of course. Whatever is needed.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.200
Look, they're bringing the party
to us.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.231
Ready?

14:25.898 --> 14:27.878
Just like old times.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.226
Balleseros.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.557
What are you doing here?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.892
I had some unfinished business
to attend to.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.593
Ah-ah-ah.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.671
Balleseros, I need those canisters.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.399
And you'll get them,
as soon <i>as</i> I get what I came for.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.908
Major Balleseros,
why don't you put down the gun?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.910
Yeah, I think I'll hang on to it.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.076
I just want
what's inside the crate.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.851
The old woman? Why?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.917
She's Julia's mother.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.955
Your mother'?
Just let me make sure she's all right.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.418
Go.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.429
I always knew you were capable
of murder, but mass murder?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.636
What are you talking about?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.800
Don't know about an outbreak
in Puerto Rico?

15:33.966 --> 15:35.775
Narvik-A.
You don't know about that?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.472
Of course he does.
He smuggled it off the base.

15:38.938 --> 15:43.114
Whatever you think I have done has
nothing to do with the reason I am here.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.653
I only want the list.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.984
What list?
Hatake knows which one.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.620
The Inuit children.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.828
You're a dead man, Sergio.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.293
Shut up, Blake.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.794
You two know each other.
Why does that not surprise me?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.134
You're dead,
but you just don't know it.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.467
Shut up. I'm not
going to tell you again.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.007
And what are you gonna do,
shoot me?

16:09.302 --> 16:12.340
I don't work for them. You get it?

16:15.408 --> 16:16.648
Now,

16:18.311 --> 16:20.120
the list.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.660
I appreciate everything you're doing,
but we should get back.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.824
This will only take a moment. We'll get
to the bottom of what's ailing you.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.363
You know, I can take care
of the rest myself.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.941
Nonsense. This is
my bailiwick, anyways.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.508
Your bailiwick?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.839
I'm a hematologist.
Didn't I mention that?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.448
My specialty is
rare blood diseases,

16:45.638 --> 16:49.518
although you rarely get anything
exotic all the way up here.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.780
Dr. Haven, I don't think...
Bloody hell.

16:53.679 --> 16:58.856
I'm seeing severely elevated levels
of beta hCG. I don't mean to alarm you

16:59.352 --> 17:04.358
but levels this high could sometimes
be indicators of certain types of cancer.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.367
Have you...?

17:24.076 --> 17:27.421
Thirty-one Inuit children
over the past 20 years, abducted,

17:27.880 --> 17:31.384
experimented on like lab rats,
and then put up for adoption.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.555
I want the list
with their locations.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.722
Why would you assume
such a list exists?

17:37.089 --> 17:40.263
A lot of people seem to think
it does, including your son.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.232
Is that true?

17:42.728 --> 17:45.072
Did you take children?

17:47.400 --> 17:51.906
Many sacrifices were made
in the pursuit of science.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.410
I am not proud.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.574
But surely you,

17:54.740 --> 17:58.085
of all people,
can understand that.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.121
I know all about sacrifices.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.419
I've sacrificed nearly every
relationship I ever had to science.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.960
But human experimentation?

18:05.451 --> 18:07.863
On children, no less?

18:08.854 --> 18:11.528
I'm not that man anymore.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.600
Then prove it.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.762
Give me the list

18:16.262 --> 18:17.935
and I give you the canisters.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.270
There is no list. I'm sorry.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.776
That is bullshit.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.140
No written list.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.449
The information you seek
is here.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.115
Those children are never

18:28.274 --> 18:29.776
far from my thoughts.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.321
I remember every one of them

18:34.280 --> 18:36.783
and where they were placed.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.159
Shall we begin?

18:57.803 --> 18:58.975
Jaye, can you hear me?

18:59.338 --> 19:00.976
No. No more, please.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.484
It's okay. They can't
hurt you anymore.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.650
Who are you?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.825
My name is Julia.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.652
Jul...

19:13.152 --> 19:15.325
I have a daughter named Julia.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.162
I know.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.998
She's just a little girl.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.507
You have to let me go.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.445
I'm supposed to take care of her.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.840
Shh, it's okay.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.180
I'm gonna take care of you
right now.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.214
It's okay.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.716
Alan.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.061
Virus and cure.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.889
They're yours now.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.411
Dr. Farragut.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.777
I was beginning
to feel neglected.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.289
Not a feeling you're used to, I'm sure.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.086
You know very little about me,

20:50.449 --> 20:53.760
but I know a great deal
about you.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.597
Second son to a second son,

20:57.123 --> 21:00.593
destined for mediocrity
while your handsome brother

21:00.760 --> 21:03.138
scooped up all the accolades.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.775
Not to mention Julia Walker.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.137
You don't know me.

21:07.299 --> 21:09.108
No.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.947
But I do understand you

21:12.438 --> 21:14.440
more than you can imagine.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.287
And I see you're tired

21:17.443 --> 21:19.286
from chasing
someone else's dreams.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.619
That is not what this is about.
Of course it is.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.626
You've made a career
out of following in Alan's footsteps,

21:25.785 --> 21:27.731
Stop it.
Wishing that once,

21:27.920 --> 21:30.958
you know, just once, you could
finish higher than second place.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.069
I said stop!

21:34.326 --> 21:36.328
Go on, then.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.636
Get it over with.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.319
You have no idea
what you've put me through.

21:50.075 --> 21:51.315
All for a good cause.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.591
Smuggling the virus off the base
was a masterstroke.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.749
Yeah.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.486
And it almost got me killed,

21:58.651 --> 22:01.655
transformed into
one of those things.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.695
You've been loyal to us
for many years

22:04.857 --> 22:07.337
and it has not gone unnoticed.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.839
Together, you and I will
shape the future of the world.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.686
To the future.

22:36.488 --> 22:37.728
To the future.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.528
Now, this might sting a bit.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.377
- How is she?
- Stable.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.885
They have her hopped up on
all kinds of heavy-duty tranquilizers.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.387
She say anything?

23:00.713 --> 23:03.387
She still remembers me
as a little girl.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.058
You know,
I dreamed of this moment,

23:08.721 --> 23:11.895
wished I could talk to her
just once.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.068
And now...
It may take time, Jules.

23:15.594 --> 23:19.440
Who knows what condition she's been
kept in the last 30 years? Tortured.

23:19.598 --> 23:21.509
The mind can shut down
to protect itself.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.079
My mind is fine.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.773
My body, on the other hand...

23:29.742 --> 23:33.849
How are you feeling?
Like a house fell on me.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.916
Where am I?
Arctic Biosystems.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.088
I never thought
I'd hear that name again.

23:42.087 --> 23:47.469
You remember this place?
I practically lived here for six years.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.771
Me and...

23:53.265 --> 23:54.767
Your daughter.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.610
Jules.

24:03.642 --> 24:07.215
And that's you, right?

24:11.283 --> 24:13.627
You're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.469
You must have so many questions.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.801
Yeah, that's an understatement.

24:30.002 --> 24:33.313
I wish I would've had the courage
to take you away from here sooner.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.185
I wish...

24:39.645 --> 24:40.680
so many things.

24:40.846 --> 24:41.984
Why did you stay?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.989
And you built that cabin.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.153
I loved your father very much.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.326
I wanted to keep
our family together.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.934
I thought...

24:57.930 --> 25:02.037
I hoped Hiroshi would change.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.009
But he was too ambitious.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.347
And I was a fool.

25:14.013 --> 25:18.359
I'm so sorry, Jules.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.398
There wasn't a day that went by
that I didn't think of you.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.031
Me too.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.038
Who's the handsome fella?

25:38.203 --> 25:41.878
Jane Walker,
Dr. Alan Farragut.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.043
It's an honor to meet you,
ma'am.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.217
Polite too.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.552
He's a keeper.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.554
We were married.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.864
Um...

25:55.020 --> 25:56.727
Married?

25:59.491 --> 26:01.061
Guess I have missed a lot.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.420
Hiroshi?

26:22.247 --> 26:24.090
Hello, Jane.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.421
Look at you.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.930
You're exactly the same.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.592
Not exactly.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.303
I am older,

26:38.263 --> 26:40.470
in spite of how I look.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.109
And how is that fair?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.782
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

26:57.116 --> 26:58.288
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

26:59.118 --> 27:00.495
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

27:01.386 --> 27:03.297
What's happening?
Is it Ilaria?

27:03.822 --> 27:05.631
I don't think so.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.135
Then who?

27:09.461 --> 27:10.838
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

27:11.463 --> 27:12.567
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

27:32.818 --> 27:34.661
Hey, I heard the alarm.
Is everyone okay?

27:34.820 --> 27:37.323
We're about to find out. I thought
you were going down to the cabin.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.769
Level E.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.000
Daniel?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.839
Miksa.
I'm his brother.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.341
And you must be the child thief.
Tulok, no!

27:58.343 --> 27:59.686
We came to help these people.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.017
Help how?

28:02.314 --> 28:05.887
Sergio says you don't have
enough snowmobiles to evacuate.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.696
Now you do.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.903
Where's Miksa?

28:34.346 --> 28:35.882
Peter.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.388
What happened?
The Scythe.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.393
He must've got a hand free.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.888
And the next thing I know,
I was waking up.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.725
Where is he?
I'm sorry, Alan.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.402
I screwed up bigtime.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.608
All the scientists,
up to the loading ramp. Now.

28:53.765 --> 28:57.076
Spencer will never allow us to leave
the base before ilaria arrives.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.240
We have to try.
Then we are doomed to fail.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.074
I don't believe that.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.585
He's not infallible.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.245
No one is.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.517
Every living thing has a weakness.
Every virus, every human being.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.752
We have to try. There has to be a way.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.093
There is one way.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.766
His only weakness.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.304
- Okay, I got it.
- Help me carry this over.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.942
Yup. There you go.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.439
Give me some rope.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.112
Two snowmobiles can go up here.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.716
Hey.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.817
What are you doing?
Trusting you with the world.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.957
Is that all?
No matter what happens,

29:41.113 --> 29:44.788
you have to get the canisters to Barrow,
then a flight to Lares, Puerto Rico.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.453
We'll take them there together.
I hope you're right.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.293
Because if we fail...
We won't.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.797
Keep it coming.
Alan.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.811
Be careful.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.322
It's all in here.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.485
Dr. Jordan.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.496
I've been looking for you.
Sorry, busy.

30:23.655 --> 30:27.694
Wanna hear about your test results?
I had a spinal tumor, and now I don't.

30:27.859 --> 30:31.033
If you're gonna tell me cancer is back...
Cancer? Ha, ha.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.335
My dear girl, you're pregnant.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.539
I'm what?
You'll need a more reliable test

30:38.704 --> 30:40.183
back home,

30:42.674 --> 30:44.017
but congratulations.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.019
All right, let's keep it going.
Keep it going.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.355
Come on. Everyone stick together
until we get to the snowmobiles.

30:52.884 --> 30:54.864
Okay, we're almost done.
Let's keep going.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.397
As fast as you can.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.057
Keep it up.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.871
No!

31:05.030 --> 31:06.202
Everyone, out!

31:42.567 --> 31:44.569
Jules.

31:45.537 --> 31:46.572
- Jules.
- Alan.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.580
Don't hurt her.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.919
Why would I?

31:57.082 --> 31:59.358
I've everything I need
right here.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.122
Virus, cure and Hatake's spawn.

32:02.287 --> 32:04.597
It seems Puerto Rico
wasn't necessary after all.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.429
You murdered hundreds of people.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.801
As your people have done for centuries,
with your witch trials and inquisitions.

32:10.962 --> 32:14.102
You know that's not the truth, Spencer.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.942
Don't call me that.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.945
Those are lies propagated
by your mother and father.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.481
Let my daughter go.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.643
You can take me back with you.
No, no.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.789
Jane! Stop!

32:25.944 --> 32:28.481
Please, don't!
Let her go, Spencer.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.285
Don't call me that.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.452
Jane! No!

32:46.631 --> 32:48.304
Jane.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.327
Mother!

33:32.844 --> 33:35.188
Find me.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.261
The check, sir.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.862
Take your time.

35:29.628 --> 35:30.800
You found Julia?

35:33.465 --> 35:35.138
Yeah.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.178
Is she, uh...?

35:39.304 --> 35:41.011
Alive?

35:42.173 --> 35:43.311
I think so.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.148
Oh. Thank God.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.415
How did you find her?

35:47.979 --> 35:49.686
You don't wanna know.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.490
You know what to do.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.159
If I'm not at the checkpoint,

35:57.322 --> 35:59.324
push on without me.

36:42.967 --> 36:44.537
Shall we begin?

36:55.547 --> 36:58.187
