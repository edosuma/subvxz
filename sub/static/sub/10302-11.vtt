02:05.280 --> 02:07.475
Hi, Kel. What are you listening to?

02:07.680 --> 02:11.275
Radio Love-Line.
It's listener-dedication hour.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.789
How many dedications did I get?

02:16.240 --> 02:17.798
Three, actually.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.116
"Lonely Boy"...

02:20.400 --> 02:22.675
..."Like a Virgin"...

02:23.960 --> 02:27.555
...and "When A Man Loves
A Rubber Woman."

02:32.800 --> 02:34.995
And I suppose you got
your usual dedication:

02:35.200 --> 02:37.430
"She Works Hard for the Money."

02:40.160 --> 02:42.913
Well, whatever gave you the idea
that I am some cheap tramp?

02:43.120 --> 02:45.918
And now, dedicated to Kelly.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.395
"She Works Hard For..."

02:57.160 --> 03:00.038
Oh, hi, Mom. Bud broke your radio.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.748
That's okay. It was your father's.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.996
Hey, kids, look what just came
in the mail.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.113
It's my first Best of Oprah
videocassette.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.958
"Volume one:
Mom's a Dad and I'm So Sad."

03:22.680 --> 03:25.513
If the world had only one throat...

03:27.160 --> 03:29.913
A fat woman
sloshed into the shoe store today...

03:30.120 --> 03:32.759
...said she was retaining water.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.110
I said not to worry about it.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.038
The dam of cellulite
holding it back...

03:37.240 --> 03:39.913
...should keep us all high and dry
for the next few years.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.237
Now, I don't know when they started
letting women carry stun guns...

03:43.440 --> 03:44.839
...but I'll tell you this...

03:45.040 --> 03:49.556
There he goes again.
On and on about his non-life.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.997
Hey, news flash, people.
You have a dog.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.869
A dog who hasn't been brushed
or bathed in six years.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.640
Now I know how Willie Nelson feels.

04:01.080 --> 04:05.870
Hey, don't mind me. I'll just lick
my genitalia and go to sleep alone.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.914
Much lik e the boy.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.393
Hey, ever hear of affection?

04:11.600 --> 04:15.309
We love to be petted,
much lik e the girl.

04:16.519 --> 04:21.389
Well, that's it. I'm fed up.
I can tak es no more. I'm out of here.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.396
No, no, no.
Don't try and stop me now.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.314
Well, thank you.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.910
Okay, you'll be sorry.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.398
Boy, am I sorry.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.717
Running away,
what the hell was I thinking?

04:41.920 --> 04:45.276
Hey, you. New dog.
What are you in for?

04:45.520 --> 04:48.717
I ran away from home
to teach my family a lesson.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.598
Well, you know what they say.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.031
"You can't teach an old family
new tricks."

04:54.600 --> 04:55.919
That's what you think.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.749
I'm sure right now my family's
beside themselves with grief.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.749
So then, this skinny woman
with a hook nose...

05:04.000 --> 05:06.036
...Olive Oyls into the shoe store...

05:06.240 --> 05:08.800
...and says, " I want something
to make me look sexy."

05:09.000 --> 05:12.231
So I say, "You'll have to wait
a long time before someone that ugly...

05:12.440 --> 05:15.000
...comes in to stand next to you."

05:17.880 --> 05:19.393
Excuse me, boy.

05:19.600 --> 05:24.674
Now, I don't know when they started
letting women carry nunchucks...

05:25.400 --> 05:29.154
Yeah, they're probably crying
their eyes out for me right now.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.833
Hey, what's the boxer in for?

05:36.080 --> 05:39.038
Oh, nothing, if you hear him tell it.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.713
I'm innocent. Innocent.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.958
You know I'm innocent, don't you?

05:52.640 --> 05:56.519
Only in America
with our system of jurisprudence...

05:56.720 --> 06:02.955
...would this have happened
to an upstanding boxer lik e yourself!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.718
And who's that over there?

06:06.680 --> 06:09.877
Oh, that's Madonna's dog.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.829
After the book came out,
he turned himself in.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.076
So how does it work around here?
I mean, lik e, when do we eat?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.311
Eat? Let's see, it's almost 9...

06:22.520 --> 06:24.556
About three days from now.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.712
That soon? Hey!

06:29.800 --> 06:33.634
I think I'm gonna lik e this place.
Yeah, too bad I won't be here long.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.957
I mean, not with my family
out searching for me.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.631
So then, this woman comes in...

06:45.040 --> 06:47.395
...who doesn't speak English.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.719
She points at the shoes,
I point at the door.

06:52.240 --> 06:56.711
She points at the sky,
and knees me in the nay-nays.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.673
I said...

06:59.880 --> 07:01.632
- Come in!
- Come in!

07:04.560 --> 07:06.198
Hi, Bud.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.958
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

07:14.160 --> 07:15.388
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no. Not at all!

07:15.640 --> 07:17.710
- We're very excited to see you.
- Sit down.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.150
See you later. Bye.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.035
Hey, Al, when was the last time
you got some good news?

07:27.400 --> 07:31.518
Well, when I was 7
my mother told me I was adopted.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.914
Which turned out to be a vicious lie,
but it was good news at the time.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.470
Well, guess what's happening
in a week from now?

07:38.680 --> 07:43.913
The nudie bar is having their annual
Wrestle Till You're Raw Night.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.953
Is it that time of year already?

07:47.160 --> 07:50.470
God, time sure flies
when you're married and have no life.

07:51.800 --> 07:55.156
They're selling raffle tickets
for a drawing to see who gets to...

07:55.360 --> 07:57.112
...oil down the first girl.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.273
Yes, first oil.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.437
And you know who's gonna be
in the ring, don't you, buddy?

08:08.280 --> 08:11.431
Maria Cantalopes Meyers?

08:14.040 --> 08:18.830
Versus
Yolanda "Deep Shade" McSuade.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.874
Wow, truly a battle of the titans.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.796
Maria and the Shadester.
Four of my favourites.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.230
Jefferson, I have to be the one
to get that first oil.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.749
- How much are tickets?
- Twenty bucks a piece.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.393
A little steep, huh?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.719
Yolanda and Maria.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.519
All right, well...

08:44.720 --> 08:47.712
...turn around. I don't want you
to see where I hide the money.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.514
Gee, I wonder what's taking
the family so long.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.429
I mean, they sure act fast enough
when the blond girl gets lost.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.159
Of course, unlik e her
I've never got lost in the house.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.114
They'll be here.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.556
Poor fella.
I hate to see him suffer lik e that.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.159
Me too.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.397
Shall we tell him he's gonna die?

09:25.320 --> 09:28.198
Yeah, why not. Hey, you, buckaroo.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.029
There's something you ought
to know about this place.

09:32.280 --> 09:36.671
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
I'm not anyone's bitch, okay?

09:43.680 --> 09:46.831
No. No, not that.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.238
Too bad though, he is a look er.

09:51.160 --> 09:55.233
You better hope somebody comes in
to get you in seven days or less.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.796
What happens after seven days?

09:58.040 --> 10:01.430
Well, let's say you'll be drinking
out of God's toilet.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.234
You mean, I'll... I'll be dead?

10:05.440 --> 10:09.115
Whoa, that's certainly a cage soiler.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.598
Hey, but I'm not worried. I mean...

10:11.800 --> 10:14.314
...I got four people
scouring the city for me right now.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.919
Lik e, there's Bud, you know?

10:18.840 --> 10:20.910
Well, if he can't even find
a two-legged dog...

10:21.120 --> 10:23.588
...why would I think
he'd find a four-legged one?

10:24.840 --> 10:29.470
Oh, but the girl...
The girl... is an idiot.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.235
I wouldn't have any use for her at all
if she didn't undress in front of me.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.394
Well, the redhead...

10:36.600 --> 10:37.999
She wouldn't know I was gone...

10:38.200 --> 10:41.795
...unless my picture
was on the side of a bonbon box.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.359
I guess my only hope is
the big dumb guy with the stinky feet.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.712
My pal Al.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.433
He won't let me down.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.399
Besides, what else does he got going
in his life?

10:57.400 --> 11:00.392
But... But I don't wanna die!
I mean, I've got so much to live for.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.116
I got balls yet to catch,
and cats to tree, bones to bury.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.790
Gee, come to think of it,
we don't really do much, do we?

11:24.560 --> 11:26.915
How does he do that?

11:27.440 --> 11:31.638
Ever since his people had him fixed
he doesn't date much.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.919
Oh, I see.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.793
Hey, look, guys. I know
I'm only the new kid on death row...

11:37.000 --> 11:40.549
...but given what seems to be in store,
shouldn't we be knee deep in our own...

11:40.800 --> 11:45.078
Keep your fur on,
tall, dark and wormy.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.032
It's visitor's day.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.192
Why, we could get abducted.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.076
No, no. He means adopted.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.068
If a family comes in and lik es you,
you're sprung.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.910
Hey, pick me.
I'm really good with kids.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.429
Hey, hey!

12:19.360 --> 12:23.956
Hey, lady. I'm a genius in French,
so you'll tak e me, please.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.750
I want this one.

12:28.960 --> 12:33.112
Oh, but, honey, he's old and ugly.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.719
Yeah, well, from where I stand...

12:35.920 --> 12:38.992
...you're not exactly
Sharon Stone yourself.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.553
How about we forget the whole thing
and go get an ice cream?

12:46.760 --> 12:49.957
- Okay.
- Good boy!

12:57.800 --> 12:59.119
I am not giving up!

12:59.320 --> 13:02.551
If that family can look for a dog,
my family can look for a dog.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.435
Besides, I've got seven days.
No problem.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.120
Problem.

13:14.720 --> 13:19.350
Al, have you noticed anything different
around the house lately?

13:19.960 --> 13:23.714
You know, I just can't help but feel
that there is something missing...

13:23.920 --> 13:27.390
...and I am very observant
about these things.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.671
Eat up, boy.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.835
Well, Peg, what do you think?

13:44.680 --> 13:47.513
That is the most disgusting tie
I've ever seen.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.512
I'm not talking about the tie,
I'm talking about the shirt.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.152
Look okay? I wanna look my best
for Wrestle Till You're Raw Night.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.716
You know, Larry Linville from M* A*S*H
is gonna be one of the judges.

14:00.920 --> 14:04.310
So did Lumber City
give him the week off?

14:05.120 --> 14:08.590
I'm going to the frat house.
How you doing, boy?

14:08.840 --> 14:13.391
Hey, Bud, have you noticed
anything missing around here lately?

14:15.080 --> 14:16.832
The van Gogh?

14:18.480 --> 14:20.675
Mom, Dad, you're never gonna guess
what happened.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.519
Okay, I was out walking Buck.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.794
When suddenly I realized...

14:26.000 --> 14:29.276
...that he wasn't stopping
at every tree and hydrant on the block.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.674
And that's when I looked down
at the end of the leash...

14:32.880 --> 14:35.394
...and saw that I was Buck-naked.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.272
I knew something was missing.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.517
He couldn't have been gone for long.
His food got eaten every day.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.517
Al?

14:54.840 --> 14:56.512
Oh, Buck's gone.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.039
Okay now, kids...

14:58.240 --> 15:02.870
...go outside and look under the house
where your father usually hides.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.789
I'm gonna go get a flashlight.
We gotta find Buck.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.511
Buck's gone?

15:36.120 --> 15:37.678
- Nudie-mart!
- Nudie-mart!

15:37.880 --> 15:39.108
- All right!
- All right!

15:39.720 --> 15:41.551
Oh, bad news, Al.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.911
They didn't draw my number
for first oil but...

15:45.120 --> 15:47.554
...they drew yours.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.677
Okay, you ready, Dad?

15:52.920 --> 15:56.230
- Ready for what?
- To go find Buck.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.756
Well, I'll keep my eyes peeled
from here to the nudie bar. Let's go.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.232
Dad! Buck is the family dog and
the whole family should look for him.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.277
Oh, pumpkin!

16:06.520 --> 16:09.034
Now, if you were a dog,
where would you go?

16:09.280 --> 16:11.077
Well, that depends.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.669
Are you a dog too?

16:15.200 --> 16:18.351
Al, I am serious. Buck could be hurt.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.511
He could be lying in the gutter, Dad.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.039
Did it ever occur to any of you
that Buck might have just run away?

16:25.240 --> 16:28.152
I've thought of it myself
a million times.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.278
He could be eating a steak right now,
drinking a daiquiri...

16:31.480 --> 16:34.631
...or doing that little cocker spaniel
down the end of the street.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.679
Our dog Buck...

16:36.880 --> 16:40.759
...might for the first time in his life
be truly happy.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.517
Who cares? We want him back.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.948
Yeah, we want Buck.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.878
- Yeah, Dad.
- Dad, go find Buck.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.593
I don't wanna have to go get...

16:48.800 --> 16:52.395
Look, Al, I know you're in a bind,
but it's a quarter till.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.989
Go ahead. Try to hold off the pouring
of the first oil. I'll get in the car...

16:57.200 --> 17:00.397
...go around the block a few times
to find him. Shouldn't take long.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.591
I'd like to...

17:03.160 --> 17:06.038
Oh. Now, now, honey.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.630
It's okay. Daddy'll find Buck.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.590
Has he ever let you down before?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.549
Oh, it's okay, honey.

17:18.760 --> 17:19.954
You know, just remember...

17:20.160 --> 17:22.515
...Daddy loves Buck
just as much as we do.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.118
They're best friends.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.598
Well...

17:29.280 --> 17:31.669
...I found Buck. Now here, I gotta go.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.549
Hey, wait a second!

17:46.400 --> 17:48.197
This isn't Buck.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.915
Well, that may be, but I still gotta go.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.828
Okay, Al. Now, look...

18:00.040 --> 18:01.917
...if pouring some oil
on some women...

18:02.120 --> 18:05.556
...that even Senator Packwood
wouldn't grope...

18:07.280 --> 18:08.713
...is more important to you...

18:08.920 --> 18:11.639
...than reuniting
your faithful and loving puppy...

18:11.840 --> 18:15.515
...with your faithful and loving family,
then just go.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.838
But know that we'll be here
crying our eyes out.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.712
Okay, okay.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.073
- Bye.
- Get back here.

18:27.280 --> 18:31.876
Well, Peg, Buck'll come home.
I always do.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.829
Don't you know
tonight is very important to me.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.273
Oh, not the theme to Lassie.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.078
Anything but the theme to Lassie.
You know how it chokes me up.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.429
All right, let's go find him.
Let's go find Buck.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.915
And I really hate you guys for this.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.918
Well, not just for this,
but especially this.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.839
Oh, Lassie.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.474
They're not really gonna tak e me
to the green door?

19:23.720 --> 19:28.396
The Lord is my German shepherd,
I shall not want.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.594
Doesn't he know any other songs?

19:42.080 --> 19:46.119
- What was that?
- Be at peace, my son.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.999
Oh, put a sock in it, padre.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.156
If only my people
would come for me.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.112
I promise, I'd never run away again...

19:55.320 --> 19:59.711
...or chew on their shoes, or pass wind
and watch as they blame it on the boy.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.198
It's... It's them!

20:04.440 --> 20:07.113
What is it, Peg? Why we've been
to about 40 of these places.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.038
This is the last one, Al.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.874
They've come to rescue me!

20:12.240 --> 20:14.071
Gosh...

20:14.840 --> 20:16.671
I knew they wouldn't forget me.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.872
Well...

20:19.240 --> 20:21.196
...he's not here.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.316
Hey! Hey, yes, I am!
Hey, look down, you moron!

20:25.560 --> 20:27.949
Well, are you sure, Al?
I mean, maybe we should...

20:28.160 --> 20:30.674
Peg, don't you think if Buck were here
he'd be barking?

20:31.520 --> 20:34.751
I know, because a man and his dog
have a bond.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.679
And if... Will you shut up, you mutt?

20:38.440 --> 20:41.432
Oh, look at the cute puppies.
Hey, Daddy, can we get a puppy?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.309
Oh, this one just licked my face.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.954
"This dog lick ed my face."

20:48.160 --> 20:51.357
You should have seen where
his tongue was a few minutes ago.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.395
Fools, I'm down here.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.949
Puppy'll cost you $15.

20:58.200 --> 21:02.591
And could you speed it up a little bit.
I got an execution to do.

21:05.840 --> 21:10.436
Wait a second.
This big one looks a little like Buck.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.310
Well, that couldn't be.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.393
You know the irony in this is...

21:15.600 --> 21:18.478
...they should be putting you guys
to sleep in 30 seconds.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.589
Well, wait a minute now.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.949
- That is Buck!
- It is Buck!

21:22.160 --> 21:23.388
- Buck! Buck!
- It is Buck!

21:23.640 --> 21:25.676
Hey, hey, hey. That's our dog.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.917
- He'll cost you 20 bucks.
- Twenty bucks?

21:29.120 --> 21:32.271
Why, for 20 bucks
I can get a real good suit.

21:32.520 --> 21:36.718
The fathead losered his way
into the pound today...

21:37.920 --> 21:40.639
Well, I guess we'll take the old boy.
Yeah.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.796
And we're never gonna let this
happen again.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.798
Yeah. Everything's gonna be different
from now on, Buck.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.355
That's right. We're gonna play
and we're gonna romp.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.755
We'll bathe you.
We'll even feed you, Buck.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.919
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Oh, Buck boy. So good.

22:04.160 --> 22:08.278
Kelly, the Best of Oprah. Volume Two
just came.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.471
Here we go.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.831
"The Cross and the double-cross.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.072
Catholic men
who dress like women."

22:17.600 --> 22:20.433
Hey, Ma, think Dad'll let me use
the car tonight?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.995
Well, depends on what mood he's in.

22:23.240 --> 22:27.916
I wish the world were a fly
and I was a giant rolled-up newspaper.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.829
Here we go.

22:30.080 --> 22:33.629
A fat woman clip-clopped
into the shoe store today...

22:34.200 --> 22:36.589
...and said, " I need something
I'd be comfortable in."

22:36.800 --> 22:39.234
I said, "Try Wyoming."

22:43.840 --> 22:47.674
Now, I don't know when they started
letting women carry chain saws...

22:48.160 --> 22:51.630
Oh, lik e your family's any better.
