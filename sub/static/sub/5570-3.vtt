WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.703
My name is Brian Finch.

00:02.736 --> 00:05.106
I was your average
28-year-old screwup

00:05.139 --> 00:07.575
until I took a pill called NZT.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.711
Suddenly, I had access
to every brain cell.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.813
Every time he takes it,
for the next 12 hours,

00:12.846 --> 00:14.348
he basically becomes the
smartest person in the world.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.716
BRIAN:
And that's why
the FBI hired me.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.251
My name's Brian Finch,

00:17.285 --> 00:18.419
this is Rebecca Harris
and we're with the FBI.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.820
God, that sounds cool.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.722
There's just one problem.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.224
NZT will kill you,

00:23.257 --> 00:25.359
unless you have this shot.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.695
Now you can have as much NZT as
you want with no side effects.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.063
And why would you help me?

00:29.097 --> 00:30.198
Let's just say I need somebody

00:30.231 --> 00:31.199
in your position.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.101
You describe to the FBI,
or anyone,

00:33.134 --> 00:33.967
about these shots...

00:34.001 --> 00:35.603
I will let you die
more painfully

00:35.636 --> 00:37.338
and slowly than you can fathom.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.607
So, Brian, you ready
to become somebody who matters?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.544
Dad?
Dennis?
Dad?

00:43.577 --> 00:45.413
Dad?
Dennis.
Dad...

00:45.446 --> 00:48.482
Brian, you saved my life.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.084
SIPIWE:
As long as he keeps
taking his pills...

00:51.585 --> 00:53.554
...does everything
we tell him to do,

00:53.587 --> 00:55.223
just the way
we tell him to do it,

00:55.256 --> 00:57.225
I think he'll make
a full recovery.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.761
EDDIE:
Every so often,
you take one of these shots...

01:01.862 --> 01:03.631
...and you can have as much NZT

01:03.664 --> 01:05.166
as you want,
with no side effects.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.335
DENNIS:
Somehow,

01:07.368 --> 01:08.636
you get me a new liver.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.605
There is something
that you're not telling me.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.274
You describe it
to your parents, to anyone,

01:13.307 --> 01:15.143
I will let you die more
painfully and slowly

01:15.176 --> 01:16.544
than you can fathom.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.717
What are you doing
around my dad?

01:23.751 --> 01:25.386
Excuse me?
Brian, right?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.455
Don't pretend like
we've never met.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.223
We both know you
work for him.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.658
So why did he
send you here?

01:30.691 --> 01:32.493
Are you threatening
my father?

01:32.526 --> 01:33.561
I'm a nurse.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.529
I'm a very good nurse,
actually.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.831
Why do you think
Mr. Morra uses me?

01:37.865 --> 01:40.401
I'm here to help
your father and you.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.303
That shot we gave you,
it's not gonna last forever.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.138
You're gonna need another one
in about a month,

01:44.172 --> 01:46.174
and if I'm here, we can take
care of that more easily.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.544
Why does Eddie Morra
need a plant in the FBI?

01:50.578 --> 01:51.712
What does he
want me to do?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.181
I have no idea.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.248
I'm a nurse.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.184
Relax, Brian.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.151
This is a good thing.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.253
And if Mr. Morra wants
something from you,

01:59.287 --> 02:00.154
he'll be in touch.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.922
BRIAN:
Of course I didn't trust her.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.592
But I knew I couldn't find
my way out of this mess

02:04.625 --> 02:06.927
without the same pill
that got me into it.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.263
Now that they're letting me out
into the field during the day,

02:09.297 --> 02:11.199
the FBI wants me
to use my commute

02:11.232 --> 02:13.167
to study stuff
they think I should know.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.169
So Mike and Ike, my bodyguards,

02:15.203 --> 02:16.504
started coming by every morning

02:16.537 --> 02:18.772
to give me my pills...

02:18.806 --> 02:19.773
Ah...

02:19.807 --> 02:20.908
...which always makes for

02:20.941 --> 02:23.311
a very interesting subway ride.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.313
(over headphones):
Game theory holds that
self-interest is reliably

02:25.346 --> 02:27.248
the driving factor
in human behavior...

02:27.281 --> 02:29.283
(cello melody playing)

02:33.554 --> 02:35.423
That's Bach.
That's Allemande.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.191
It's a great piece of music.

02:37.225 --> 02:37.891
Can I try?

02:37.925 --> 02:40.261
Sure.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.829
I think your "C" string
is a little sharp.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.797
(tuning note)

02:46.467 --> 02:47.868
Brian.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.169
Shauna.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.339
Wow, what has it been?

02:51.372 --> 02:53.207
It's... almost three years.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.842
(laughs)

02:54.875 --> 02:55.976
Shauna.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.811
The one that got away.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.213
*

03:00.248 --> 03:01.449
(whooping)

03:06.554 --> 03:07.921
How have you been?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.590
I've been good.
I've been really good.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.425
BRIAN:
So, we talked and talked.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.894
And if you ever do bump into
the one that got away,

03:13.927 --> 03:17.265
I highly recommend doing it
while you're on NZT.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.966
(speaking Cantonese)

03:18.999 --> 03:21.535
Oh!

03:21.569 --> 03:23.437
BRIAN:
By the time

03:23.471 --> 03:25.739
she got off at her stop,
I had her new number

03:25.773 --> 03:28.276
and a promise
that we'd catch up soon.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.777
Good morning.

03:29.810 --> 03:33.213
Oh, I am having
an amazing day today.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.017
What's going on?
I'm not sure.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.353
Naz just called
an all-hands-on-deck.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.255
NAZ:
Morning.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.258
Most of you remember
Special Agent Ray Dixon.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.760
He was in charge of Forensic
Accounting for the Bureau

03:46.794 --> 03:49.029
until he retired last year.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.433
His, uh, seminar on the paper
trail was the toughest course

03:52.466 --> 03:54.034
at Quantico.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.338
I think he gave out one "A"
in 15 years.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.607
Early this
morning, he was

03:59.640 --> 04:01.041
walking through Bronx Park

04:01.074 --> 04:03.043
when he was shot in the head
by a high-powered rifle.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.914
The NYPD think the shot
came from the top of

04:06.947 --> 04:09.016
an apartment building on
the south side of the park.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.285
I've told the NYPD

04:11.319 --> 04:14.655
that CJC will augment
their investigation.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.890
Dixon was one
of our own.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.826
He served the Bureau
for 30 years,

04:18.859 --> 04:21.362
and he left it better
than he found it.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.831
Anything useful from the scene?

04:23.864 --> 04:26.900
Very little. He was
holding this Post-it

04:26.934 --> 04:28.736
in his hand when he got shot.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
After he retired,

04:30.804 --> 04:33.907
Dixon took a job with an
executive search firm.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.044
The CEO of IDK Technologies
is stepping down.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.547
Dixon was researching
half a dozen possible candidates

04:39.580 --> 04:40.948
to replace him.

04:40.981 --> 04:45.052
Last night, a virus was sent
to Dixon's office computer

04:45.085 --> 04:46.954
that wiped out
everything.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.424
So, that combined
with the way he was killed...

04:50.458 --> 04:52.059
They think Dixon found something
compromising

04:52.092 --> 04:53.694
about one
of the potential candidates.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.563
That person paid
to have him taken out.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.897
Boyle and Harris

04:56.930 --> 04:58.065
are running point on this,

04:58.098 --> 04:59.600
but I want you all
to help them in any way

04:59.633 --> 05:01.502
they need.

05:04.372 --> 05:08.008
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.978
I haven't seen him in years,
but he was a good guy.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.780
Can I ask a question?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.715
So, Dixon's computer
was wiped out,

05:14.748 --> 05:16.517
but didn't he
keep paper files?

05:22.823 --> 05:25.092
There you go--
Ray Dixon's files.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.127
The man was
a dedicated shredder.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.430
Boyle and I are going
to check the financials

05:29.463 --> 05:31.064
of candidates
for the CEO job,

05:31.098 --> 05:34.101
while Cyber tries to trace
the virus on Dixon's computer.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.404
If you can make anything
of this,

05:36.437 --> 05:38.839
it'd be really helpful.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.550
BRIAN:
If I line up groups of letters

05:49.583 --> 05:52.386
that are likely to be paired,
I can make headway.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.154
And after that,
it's just grunt work.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.558
Thankfully, I have access
to a couple of grunts.

05:57.591 --> 06:01.462
I'm not gonna lie,
this is kind of awesome.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.896
A little messy.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.465
(phone chimes)

06:04.498 --> 06:07.801
I almost lost my phone.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.069
SHAUNA:
Okay. I have to know.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.639
What happened?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.174
(phone chimes)
What happened to you?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.644
It's all good.
You just seem so different.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.446
Smiley-face emoji.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.147
BRIAN:
Just feel good lately.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.149
Can't be down all the time,
right?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.718
Thumbs up emoji,
thumbs up emoji.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.755
SHAUNA:
But seriously,
what happened to you?

06:27.788 --> 06:29.890
Angry kitten face.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.625
BRIAN:
Wouldn't you like to know?

06:31.659 --> 06:33.461
Smug devil face emoji.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.828
If you're so curious,

06:34.862 --> 06:37.397
let's meet for dinner
and talk about it.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.838
Hmm. No answer.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.475
Too much, too soon?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.981
Boyle and I are headed out
to talk to Dixon's supervisor.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.783
Seems like you're busy here.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.518
Have you come up
with any suspects?

06:57.551 --> 06:58.652
Mm-hmm.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.187
Jeffrey Vachs?

07:00.220 --> 07:03.557
Ray Dixon had
files on everyone

07:03.591 --> 07:05.993
who was up for the CEO
job at IDK Technologies.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.096
But the biggest file
was about Vachs.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.866
Now, there's an
e-mail exchange...

07:12.900 --> 07:14.034
Blue one.
Got it!

07:14.067 --> 07:17.104
...between someone
with the address

07:17.137 --> 07:20.574
"utjv@gmail.com, and a woman
with the handle "BlackOnyx."

07:20.608 --> 07:23.477
"UTJV"-- that's Jeffrey Vachs.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.646
I'm not sure who
BlackOnyx is yet.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.880
Vachs was having an affair?

07:26.914 --> 07:29.149
And ten months ago,
he opened a new...

07:29.182 --> 07:30.618
(loudly):
checking account?

07:30.651 --> 07:31.652
Yellow.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.754
Thank you.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.923
Now, he made cash withdrawals

07:35.956 --> 07:39.927
for $9,999 out of this account

07:39.960 --> 07:41.629
eight separate times.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.230
$9,999?

07:43.263 --> 07:44.932
Mmm-hmm.
He wanted to
make sure the IRS

07:44.965 --> 07:46.634
wasn't paying attention
to what he was doing.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.936
You think Dixon uncovered that
Vachs was being blackmailed?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.539
And when Vachs learned
that he was about to be exposed,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.140
he hired someone
to take care of Dixon.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.075
Let's hear
what Vachs has to say.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.716
All right, good work.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.519
Ike! I thought we bonded.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.154
(phone chimes)

08:07.187 --> 08:09.022
SHAUNA:
Dinner sounds great!

08:09.056 --> 08:10.791
Our old place at 9:00?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.192
Yes!

08:12.225 --> 08:15.062
Sorry. Uh, ran into my ex
this morning. We vibed.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.964
No big deal,
but we've got a date at 9:00.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.899
She thought
you were pretty impressive

08:18.932 --> 08:20.000
this morning, didn't she?

08:20.033 --> 08:22.536
While you were on NZT?

08:22.570 --> 08:26.173
Each pill lasts...
12 hours?

08:26.206 --> 08:28.742
So if you're meeting up
at 9:00...

08:28.776 --> 08:30.644
IKE:
How's she gonna
like you when

08:30.678 --> 08:32.846
you're just Brian Finch?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.840
I'm sorry.
You think I'm being blackmailed?

08:59.873 --> 09:04.011
It's an idea we got from a
retired FBI Agent-- Ray Dixon.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.614
These are his files.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.281
You're making
regular payments to someone

09:08.315 --> 09:10.818
with the email address
"BlackOnyx," and we think

09:10.851 --> 09:13.186
those withdrawals may be linked
to Ray Dixon's murder.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.023
If they're not, if you have a
legitimate explanation for them,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.858
we would love to hear it
so we can move on.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.993
So then, you're not just
accusing me

09:20.027 --> 09:22.195
of having an affair
with one of my

09:22.229 --> 09:23.997
summer interns.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.133
BRIAN:
Vachs just made a slip.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.769
Nothing in those e-mails says
the woman was his intern.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.105
All I had to do was dig around
in the company where he works.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.974
(trilling)

09:41.181 --> 09:43.651
I'm not saying anything else
without a lawyer in the room.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.352
Am I free to go?

09:45.385 --> 09:48.121
(sighs)

09:50.023 --> 09:51.992
So, he doesn't need
to say anything.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.127
He told us more
than he meant to.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.328
Yes, we heard it, too.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.030
The intern--
we're on it.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.065
Yeah. I think
her name's Sarah Braden.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.169
She was tagged in a photo
from the summer of 2013.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.837
BOYLE:
How do you know

10:03.871 --> 10:06.073
this is the woman
Vachs had the affair with?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.241
Take a look at the locket
on her necklace.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.711
And just like that, boom,

10:10.744 --> 10:13.180
I was back in the field.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.919
BOYLE:
Sarah Braden?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.721
Miss Braden,

10:20.754 --> 10:22.222
we're with the FBI.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.391
Is something wrong?
REBECCA:
Do you know

10:24.424 --> 10:25.726
a Jeffrey Vachs?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.327
I'm sorry.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.362
I don't know a Jeffrey Vachs.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.264
Wh-Why?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.733
REBECCA: We have
definitive knowledge

10:32.766 --> 10:34.001
that Jeffrey Vachs
has been depositing

10:34.034 --> 10:37.204
large sums of money into your
bank account every month.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.072
(buzzing)

10:41.875 --> 10:44.211
This little kid's
Jeffrey Vachs' son.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.113
Yeah, what's up,
little man?

10:47.247 --> 10:48.115
You got your father's eyes.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.917
It's the same mutation.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.686
It's called
sectoral heterochromia.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.090
I mean, we can take
a paternity test if you want.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.992
I'm not blackmailing Jeffrey.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.029
He sends me money
because he wants to.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.898
He wants his son
to be taken care of.

11:04.932 --> 11:08.401
Even if he can't
claim him publically.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.903
That man Dixon,

11:09.937 --> 11:11.404
he figured out
the same thing you just did,

11:11.438 --> 11:12.472
but he told me
he was gonna drop it.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.142
He said he didn't want
to mess with a little kid.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.779
Jeffrey's made mistakes.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.381
But he's not a murderer.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.685
Please don't tell
his family about this.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.924
We'll call you if we have
any more questions.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.126
Vachs was just
taking care of his kid.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.363
He didn't have motive
to kill Ray Dixon.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.408
Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.043
Mike the man.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.979
How you doing, dude?
They treating you okay here?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.947
You do know Mike's
not my real name, right?

11:53.981 --> 11:55.148
Yeah, I do,
but that's our thing.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.185
Mike, Ike--
these are the jokes, right?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.820
So, listen, man.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.889
I'm really burning
the midnight oil tonight.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.792
I mean, this is a big case;
a lot of work to do.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.127
The dispensary
gives me one pill a day.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.863
I know that, but there's
got to be exceptions.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.431
Even if you do have a date.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.366
Ah! Well played, Mike.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.202
You know what?

12:15.235 --> 12:18.138
I would expect nothing less
from a man of your talents.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.907
Do people around here
know how sharp you are?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.875
'Cause I could
help you with that, man.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.878
They told me you'd try
to get into my head.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.281
That's a cynical way
of putting it.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.050
This could be the beginning
of a very mutually

12:30.083 --> 12:31.418
beneficial relationship...

12:31.451 --> 12:33.787
You think this
is a good detail?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.856
Babysitting you?

12:35.889 --> 12:38.091
You think that's
why I went to Quantico?

12:38.125 --> 12:39.793
Mm.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.294
I took this job
because they promised

12:41.328 --> 12:42.562
that if I do it for a year,

12:42.595 --> 12:45.432
I'll get a permanent
placement in the CJC

12:45.465 --> 12:47.534
as an investigator.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.536
They gave me two rules--

12:49.569 --> 12:52.005
one pill a day

12:52.039 --> 12:54.074
and don't let you get hurt.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.944
No way I'm breaking rule one.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.847
What about rule number two?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.882
One pill a day.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.985
(mouthing)

13:05.018 --> 13:08.221
BRIAN:
I'm not saying
I'm an FBI agent, per se.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.923
I mean, it's complicated.
(clears his throat)

13:09.957 --> 13:13.026
But basically, uh, they
noticed that I have aptitudes--

13:13.060 --> 13:16.496
command of certain
facts, if you will,

13:16.529 --> 13:18.565
and decided to make
me a consultant.

13:18.598 --> 13:22.870
Okay. Uh...
command of certain facts?

13:22.903 --> 13:26.173
Yeah. Okay. Like, uh...
For example,

13:26.206 --> 13:28.341
um...

13:28.375 --> 13:29.943
synthetic marijuana.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.980
Seemingly innocuous
but, actually,

13:33.013 --> 13:34.381
it's very addictive.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.317
That is a very interesting fact.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.320
Actually, uh, I researched it
for a segment at my work.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.923
You did? Wow.
You must love that.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.193
You're so good
at making the news...

13:46.226 --> 13:48.028
not boring?

13:48.061 --> 13:50.430
Thank you. That is the goal.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.032
Yeah. I don't know though.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.102
Still no promotion, huh?
No. Um,

13:55.135 --> 13:57.938
there is a segment producer
that's supposed to leave in May,

13:57.971 --> 13:59.206
and they say
that the job is mine,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.541
which is great, uh,

14:01.574 --> 14:04.611
except my landlord is selling
my building.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.948
And it was
rent-controlled.
Your place is so amazing.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.883
He can just
sell it?

14:09.917 --> 14:12.485
Yeah. I mean,
he can tear it down...

14:12.519 --> 14:13.553
He's getting rid
of the whole building?

14:13.586 --> 14:16.990
And I can't take the job
if I can't stay in the city.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.892
Sorry. I don't mean to complain.
No.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.028
No, no, no, that's fine. Um,

14:21.061 --> 14:23.330
did you know this though?
Um, there's, um,

14:23.363 --> 14:27.200
one out-out of every
200 men in the world

14:27.234 --> 14:30.103
that have a genetic marker
that trace back to Genghis Khan?

14:31.404 --> 14:34.674
That's the end of that fact.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.276
(chuckles)

14:36.309 --> 14:38.011
Are you okay?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.612
Um,

14:39.646 --> 14:41.048
just... No, no, no. I mean,

14:41.081 --> 14:43.984
this morning,
you-you had this...

14:44.017 --> 14:46.286
energy about you.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.489
And tonight you kind of seem...

14:49.522 --> 14:50.958
off.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.093
Honestly...

14:53.126 --> 14:55.428
I'm nervous
about this whole thing.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.964
I am, okay?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.365
And I just...

14:58.398 --> 14:59.632
You know what I want to say,
what I should say...

15:00.733 --> 15:02.069
...is thank you.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.971
For what?
For being

15:04.004 --> 15:05.705
a good person.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.440
You stuck with me
for a long time,

15:07.474 --> 15:09.476
and I know
it was hard.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.112
I was really down.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.514
I hung in there for so long

15:14.547 --> 15:16.383
because it was great

15:16.416 --> 15:18.986
at the beginning.
And then something changed

15:19.019 --> 15:22.089
for you, and you shut down.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.325
And I kept waiting
for you to come back.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.996
And I stayed until it looked
like you never would.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.164
But then,
this morning,

15:31.198 --> 15:34.134
there you were.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.237
BRIAN:
So, NZT might have given me
another chance

15:37.270 --> 15:39.372
with Shauna,
but what does it matter

15:39.406 --> 15:41.008
if she's leaving New York?

15:47.014 --> 15:50.150
I'm supposed to take you out
to Long Island City.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.618
Good morning to you, too, Mike.

15:51.651 --> 15:56.023
As I'm sure you're curious,
my date went okay last night.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.158
REBECCA:
The team and I went
through all the candidates

15:58.191 --> 16:00.027
for the IDK Technology job.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.694
There were no red flags.
Everyone was clean.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.031
Also, the virus on Dixon's
computer was a dead end.

16:04.064 --> 16:07.034
So I decided to follow
Dixon's own paper trail.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.102
It's what he would
have told me to do.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.572
That one "A" he gave out,
that was you, wasn't it?

16:12.605 --> 16:15.442
He wrote my name on a white
board and he left it there.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.044
So everyone that
took that seminar

16:17.077 --> 16:19.179
knows me as a forensic
accounting geek.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.048
I found consistent
withdrawals

16:21.081 --> 16:22.349
from an ATM in
this neighborhood,

16:22.382 --> 16:23.750
but he lives
ten miles away.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.752
So I showed his
picture around,

16:25.785 --> 16:28.421
and two employees from the
sandwich shop around the corner

16:28.455 --> 16:30.023
pointed me to
this storage unit.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.759
The manager told me that
someone matching his description

16:32.792 --> 16:36.629
rents a locker unit
here and pays cash.

16:45.105 --> 16:49.008
BRIAN:
This was Dixon's unit?
It looks like a precinct.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.214
REBECCA:
Everything in here pertains

16:54.247 --> 16:56.283
to a guy named Marco Ramos.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.550
He is the top lieutenant

16:57.584 --> 17:00.153
in one of the most dangerous
cartels in Oaxaca.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.689
Ray Dixon didn't get killed
because of something he did

17:02.722 --> 17:03.823
in his new job.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.126
He got killed because he
couldn't let go of his old one.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.565
BRIAN:
Hard to believe,
last month I was a temp,

17:12.599 --> 17:14.534
and now
I'm chasing drug dealers.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.337
The file on this guy
is amazing.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.440
It's like some kind
of bad movie.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.344
NARRATOR:
Marco Ramos was
the wildest nephew of the head

17:24.377 --> 17:26.213
of the Manos Sangriento cartel.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.548
Legend holds that, rather
than discipline his nephew,

17:28.581 --> 17:30.683
Ramos' uncle sent him
to America,

17:30.717 --> 17:33.486
where Ramos made money
hand over fist.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.788
So much money, he didn't know
what to do with it.

17:35.822 --> 17:40.160
A consortium of the FBI and
the New York Police Department

17:40.193 --> 17:42.195
built a racketeering case
against Ramos.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.630
But just as they were
gearing up to arrest him,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.232
he fled.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.567
That was six months ago.
No one knows

17:47.600 --> 17:50.403
where Ramos is, but his reign
of terror continues.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.239
No, please!

17:52.272 --> 17:53.673
Throw him to the piranhas.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.209
No! No!
(shouting)

17:57.244 --> 17:59.512
(screaming)

17:59.546 --> 18:02.615
Marco Ramos never
fed anyone to piranhas.

18:02.649 --> 18:03.516
Well, maybe not.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.418
But he seems like
a piranha guy to me.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.687
The point is, Dixon
was on a detail

18:07.720 --> 18:09.556
that was looking
for Ramos.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.690
Dixon kept hunting,

18:10.723 --> 18:12.459
and it looks
like it got Dixon killed.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.462
Yeah. In his files, Dixon was
able to connect Ramos' cartel

18:15.495 --> 18:18.398
to the execution of
two prosecutors in New Jersey.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.333
They were both killed
with high-powered rifle shots,

18:20.367 --> 18:21.234
same as Dixon.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.403
NAZ:
And what do we have
on the assassin?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.205
They call him La Cebra
in Mexico.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.539
There's tons of rumors
about the guy,

18:26.573 --> 18:27.807
but there's no face,
no description.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.443
BOYLE:
The only confirmation
of his existence

18:30.477 --> 18:32.579
is a partial print taken
from a windowpane

18:32.612 --> 18:35.282
at the sniper's nest
of one of the assassinations.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.284
Dixon was close. They wouldn't
have killed him if he wasn't.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.918
The NYPD still
has a task force

18:38.951 --> 18:41.321
that's looking for Ramos,
so I say we link up with them.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.323
We can reach out to them,

18:43.356 --> 18:44.457
but I'd be surprised
if we got anywhere.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.759
Let's pull all our files
on Ramos

18:46.793 --> 18:48.461
and then reach out

18:48.495 --> 18:51.364
to the old Ramos detail.
But I want to make sure

18:51.398 --> 18:53.366
you all understand this:

18:53.400 --> 18:54.667
these are bad people,

18:54.701 --> 18:56.669
and they've killed
federal agents before.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.538
Do you think
they kill consultants?

18:58.571 --> 19:01.741
We'll pull the detail together.
Uh,

19:01.774 --> 19:03.743
I'm gonna see what I can learn
about La Cebra.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.345
I mean, Ramos could be anywhere,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.180
but we know
La Cebra was in New York

19:07.214 --> 19:08.848
two days ago.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.818
I've got an idea, but
I kind of need some floor space.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.853
*

19:16.856 --> 19:19.226
La Cebra killed a couple

19:19.259 --> 19:22.695
of people here and a bunch
of people in Mexico.

19:22.729 --> 19:26.266
I spent the day looking
into every single murder.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.607
You spent the day building
a model?

19:34.641 --> 19:36.476
Uh, models. Plural.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.879
You know what,
it was time well spent, too.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.214
I had a breakthrough.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.316
See that red "X"
on the ground?

19:43.350 --> 19:46.853
That is where the police chief
was assassinated.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.623
And the only place
that the shot lines up is...

19:50.657 --> 19:52.425
the cathedral.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.527
See this trajectory right here
with this little guy?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.296
In this spot,
there's not enough room

19:56.329 --> 19:59.432
in the cathedral for a sniper
to lie down in a prone position,

19:59.466 --> 20:01.968
so the only way he could take
the shot is if he rested

20:02.001 --> 20:03.536
his rifle on the ledge.
(gunshot)

20:03.570 --> 20:06.539
Now, the Mexican P.F. found
a partial boot print there,

20:06.573 --> 20:08.408
which means La Cebra

20:08.441 --> 20:10.410
did not use a stool,
which also means

20:10.443 --> 20:12.545
the only way he could have
gotten a clean shot

20:12.579 --> 20:14.347
from over the ledge is

20:14.381 --> 20:17.784
if he was at least
six-foot, five-inches tall.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.353
Whew.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.788
That's your breakthrough?

20:21.821 --> 20:22.589
Yeah.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.424
The sniper was tall?

20:24.457 --> 20:26.393
Yeah. Well, you-you can just run
that through,

20:26.426 --> 20:28.461
you know, the database.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.996
The Tall Sniper Database.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.664
That's not a thing, is it?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.733
No, it's not a thing.
No, of course.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.469
I say we go see the NYPD
task force in the morning.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.504
They knew Dixon.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.639
Maybe I can convince them
to see their files.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.809
All right, but...
Hey, just hold on a second.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.547
'Cause, you know, I mean, it's
the end of the day, right?

20:49.482 --> 20:51.551
Beer o'clock?

20:51.584 --> 20:54.721
Plus, um, you know,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.324
wanted to kind of
pick your brain about something?

20:57.357 --> 21:00.026
Just girl-type stuff.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.595
We're at
the "relationship advice" stage?

21:02.629 --> 21:04.597
Well, we kind
of have to be.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.833
The only people
that know the details

21:06.866 --> 21:08.668
of my life work at the FBI.

21:08.701 --> 21:14.407
You are, by far, the most
normal person at the FBI, so,

21:14.441 --> 21:16.309
you're really the only
person in the world

21:16.343 --> 21:18.445
I can talk to about this stuff.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.414
I'm guessing
this is about your ex?

21:23.015 --> 21:26.353
I'm pretty sure
we can get it going again.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.555
I'm also pretty sure

21:28.588 --> 21:30.690
it's only because of NZT.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.859
So...

21:32.892 --> 21:34.861
I'm wondering, does she like me,

21:34.894 --> 21:36.896
or does she like me
on the drug?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.899
They're the same guy.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.702
Absolutely not. Not true.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.737
NZT Brian

21:44.771 --> 21:46.806
can do, oh,

21:46.839 --> 21:49.676
way more stuff
than regular Brian.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.581
What?

21:54.614 --> 21:58.050
No. There aren't two Brians.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.053
There's you.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.590
Sure, you can do more
when you're on the pill,

22:03.623 --> 22:05.625
but, either way...

22:05.658 --> 22:07.527
it's your character.

22:08.761 --> 22:12.599
The first time you took
the pill, what did you do?

22:12.632 --> 22:13.800
You helped your dad.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.068
Do you think most people,
if they could got their hands

22:16.102 --> 22:18.438
on a pill that would let them
do just about anything,

22:18.471 --> 22:21.541
the first thing they would do
would be for someone else?

22:23.543 --> 22:26.713
If she's interested in you
because of what you can do

22:26.746 --> 22:29.549
instead of who you are,

22:29.582 --> 22:31.584
then she isn't worth your time.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.554
And if she isn't...

22:36.589 --> 22:38.625
...then you're worried
about nothing.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.027
Wow.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.062
You're good at this.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.966
I'll take a rain check
on the beer.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.541
Hey!
Ugh! God.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.143
Don't you ever sleep
in your own bed?
Geez, Mike.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.679
Wizard of Oz was on last night.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.651
(sighs)

23:11.190 --> 23:13.159
All right! See?

23:13.192 --> 23:15.161
This is a dope office.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.630
Look at this.
Look at the grit.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.766
Shotgun shells
lying around.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.033
What's with the ski masks?

23:21.067 --> 23:23.069
Sometimes they wear them
when they're on raids.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.037
It can be dangerous for
cartels to see their faces.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.739
(door opens)
MAN:
You Harris?

23:26.773 --> 23:28.040
Mm.
Randy Moore.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.542
Good to meet you.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.178
This is our consultant,
Brian Finch.
(whistles)

23:32.211 --> 23:34.547
Look, my guys and I were sorry
to hear about Dixon.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.483
But you got to understand:
the last time

23:36.516 --> 23:39.185
we cooperated with the FBI,
one of our CI's got killed.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.954
No one knows exactly
what happened to your informant.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.590
And we're not asking you
to cooperate with the FBI.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.559
It's just us. We just want
to take a look at your files.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.795
What are you two gonna find
there that we can't?

23:48.828 --> 23:50.797
Fresh eyes.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.900
And Brian is a special resource.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.605
How's that exactly?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.773
Um...

24:02.542 --> 24:06.479
Well, I have, among other
things, perfect recall.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.748
I can analyze data
and patterns, and I can

24:08.781 --> 24:11.684
use that analysis to solve
complex problems or make

24:11.718 --> 24:13.753
connections.
Officer Rodriguez, right?

24:13.786 --> 24:14.921
Yeah, that's right.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.656
When you sit,
you favor your right side.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.258
Every time you put weight on
your left butt cheek, you wince,

24:19.291 --> 24:20.326
just a little bit.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.529
Now, you don't have a pulled
muscle, so, are you sore

24:22.562 --> 24:23.763
from an injection?

24:23.796 --> 24:25.632
Not to get too personal,
but that's usually where

24:25.665 --> 24:28.167
a doctor tells you to give
yourself a testosterone shot.
(taps table)

24:28.200 --> 24:29.669
Sergeant Moore,

24:29.702 --> 24:31.638
you have three different kinds
of bite marks

24:31.671 --> 24:32.872
on your arms and hands

24:32.905 --> 24:34.574
from three different kinds
of dogs.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.976
Little dogs. You are breeding
a litter of puppies.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.579
And if I had to guess
from you're overall vibe,

24:39.612 --> 24:40.713
I'd say pit bulls?

24:40.747 --> 24:43.683
Dobermans.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.519
Where'd you find him?

24:48.655 --> 24:51.123
BRIAN:
So, they let us
into their files.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.560
It was a lot to sort through,
and it wasn't that helpful.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.030
Until you are a fan
of the winter games.

24:58.064 --> 25:01.133
(fanfare plays on TV)

25:02.602 --> 25:06.038
Whoa! Look. This is a picture
from Jersey

25:06.072 --> 25:07.940
right after one
of those prosecutors got shot.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.275
Okay. So?

25:09.308 --> 25:13.045
So, this guy right there--
he's from Finland.

25:13.079 --> 25:16.983
Qualified for the winter games
in 1998 for biathlon.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.985
Excuse me?

25:21.020 --> 25:23.222
This guy was Ramos' shooter?

25:23.255 --> 25:24.957
Everyone assumes
that La Cebra is Mexican

25:24.991 --> 25:26.158
because of his nickname,

25:26.192 --> 25:29.596
but really, it can be anyone
who can take a great shot, like

25:29.629 --> 25:31.097
a biathlete.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.932
They ski,
and they shoot.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.667
"Johan Makinin."

25:34.701 --> 25:37.336
Yeah, he's six foot, six,
just like La Cebra.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.673
He spent time in Mexico,
emigrated here.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.108
You on board with this?

25:42.141 --> 25:44.043
We have La Cebra's fingerprint.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.612
Makinin lists an
address in Yorktown.

25:45.645 --> 25:46.879
What's to lose?

25:46.913 --> 25:49.148
(bubbling)

25:49.181 --> 25:51.183
*

25:57.089 --> 25:58.324
(beeping)

25:58.357 --> 26:00.192
(line ringing)

26:00.226 --> 26:01.961
MAN:
Hello?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.029
Johan Makinin?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.931
Yes?

26:04.964 --> 26:07.266
FBI. We'd like
to ask you some questions.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.108
Go! Go!

26:20.980 --> 26:23.149
(grunting)

26:24.651 --> 26:26.018
(grunting)

26:27.386 --> 26:30.089
(grunts)

26:33.059 --> 26:35.327
(cocks gun)
Mr. Makinin!

26:35.361 --> 26:39.031
You ran like a rabbit, and now,
you're gonna die like a snake.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.067
Why would I say that?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.835
That doesn't even make sense.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.637
I don't know. It's cool?

26:44.671 --> 26:46.205
Look, I'm not allowed

26:46.238 --> 26:47.640
to go on the takedowns.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.141
Let me imagine them
the way I want, okay?

26:49.175 --> 26:50.843
Anyway, you got him, right?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.344
He ran.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.213
And based on the stuff
we found in his apartment,

26:54.246 --> 26:56.048
he is definitely La Cebra.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.216
But, Brian?

26:57.249 --> 27:01.788
Makinin lost his shooting hand
two years ago.

27:01.821 --> 27:04.090
He may have killed people

27:04.123 --> 27:06.659
for Marco Ramos,
but there's no way he shot

27:06.693 --> 27:08.127
Ray Dixon two days ago.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.001
BOYLE:
The prints on your left hand

27:15.034 --> 27:16.368
match the ones
we found in Jersey.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.104
You had $4 million cash

27:18.137 --> 27:20.239
stashed in your apartment,

27:20.272 --> 27:22.709
and we can match you
to the boot print

27:22.742 --> 27:23.876
the P.F. found
in Mexico City.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.178
We know you're La Cebra.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.815
The only question left is:

27:28.848 --> 27:31.784
who's gonna put you in jail--
the United States or Mexico?

27:31.818 --> 27:34.286
REBECCA:
If we were to extradite you,
how long do you think you'd last

27:34.320 --> 27:38.090
in a prison filled with soldiers
from other cartels?

27:40.893 --> 27:42.862
I help you find Ramos,

27:42.895 --> 27:44.864
you try me here.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.867
Is that your offer?

27:49.902 --> 27:51.871
As you say,

27:51.904 --> 27:55.141
I am the gunman Marco Ramos
nicknamed La Cebra.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.177
But, as you can see,
I clearly have not

27:58.210 --> 28:01.380
done any work for the man
since this happened.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.382
I used to custom-fit
my bullets.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.217
I was getting
ready for a job,

28:05.251 --> 28:06.185
working with some gunpowder...

28:06.218 --> 28:08.020
REBECCA
Why is Ramos trying
to make it look

28:08.054 --> 28:09.756
like you're still active?

28:09.789 --> 28:14.060
The name inspires fear,
and Ramos finds that useful.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.228
But the truth is,
I have no idea.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.164
I haven't spoken to him
since he fled.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.732
Where did he go?
I don't know.

28:19.766 --> 28:22.301
He called me the night he left
to say that he feared

28:22.334 --> 28:24.503
he would soon
be arrested.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.139
He wanted to make a deal
with your government

28:27.173 --> 28:28.875
before that happened.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.143
Describe the inner workings
of his organization

28:31.177 --> 28:32.311
in exchange for some kind

28:32.344 --> 28:33.913
of leniency.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.048
Ramos was going
to betray the cartel?

28:36.082 --> 28:37.383
Become a witness?

28:37.416 --> 28:39.852
He promised he would
give me warning,

28:39.886 --> 28:41.954
time to leave the country,

28:41.988 --> 28:44.423
but...

28:44.456 --> 28:46.425
clearly, he changed his mind.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.260
So you have no
information to provide?

28:48.294 --> 28:49.862
Enjoy Mexico.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.197
Wait.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.265
There are other things I know.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.401
BRIAN:
Well, I wasn't wrong.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.870
You were wrong
about La Cebra killing Dixon.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.138
But it gave us
good information.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.506
Makinin gave us
the phone number

29:00.539 --> 29:02.975
that Ramos used
to call him from,

29:03.009 --> 29:05.144
and the shell company
that he used to pay him from.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.913
Yeah, it's
called Tiovola.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.815
Yeah, I'm gonna see where
I can get with their financials,

29:08.848 --> 29:10.449
and Rebecca's gonna take
a look at the number.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.151
Let me know
what you need from our end.

29:12.184 --> 29:15.254
You've already been a huge help.
Thank you.
(laughs)

29:15.287 --> 29:18.290
Sorry. I'm researching
something else.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.291
It's relationship stuff.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.060
In fact, I won't bore
you with the details.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.196
Hey, you guys are just
running down records, right?

29:24.230 --> 29:25.998
You don't need me for a while.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.233
Great.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.503
Sergeant Moore?

29:31.537 --> 29:33.806
Keep it real.
Or don't.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.842
Keep it however
you want to keep it.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.281
We've been after La Cebra
for years.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.583
Ramos didn't tell anyone
his button man's real name.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.352
That kid found him
in a morning.

29:46.385 --> 29:51.357
Yeah. Like I told you,
Brian is a, um, unique

29:51.390 --> 29:53.926
resource.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.061
There we go.

29:55.094 --> 29:58.197
Okay. Why are we looking

29:58.230 --> 30:00.232
at the lobby
in my building?

30:00.266 --> 30:03.435
Um, well, I was thinking
about your apartment problem.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.237
And so, I decided
to poke around a bit,

30:05.271 --> 30:06.873
see if I could help out.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.374
Like a lot of old
buildings downtown,

30:08.407 --> 30:10.242
yours wasn't always
used for housing.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.044
It used to be... a factory.

30:12.078 --> 30:15.414
Yeah, for textiles
and stuff.
Yeah.

30:15.447 --> 30:19.051
But did you know that a man by
the name of Abraham Waltham

30:19.085 --> 30:21.220
owned the factory?
And he used to be

30:21.253 --> 30:23.322
active in the Communist party?

30:23.355 --> 30:27.026
No.
Well, he did,
and he was.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.195
Who else was active
in the Communist Party

30:29.228 --> 30:31.030
back in those
days? Artists.

30:31.063 --> 30:32.631
Lots and lots of artists,

30:32.664 --> 30:35.334
including one
named Albert Harvey.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.436
He wasn't super-famous, um,

30:37.469 --> 30:40.406
but he was still very
important in his day.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.109
He did a mural
for the WPA Federal Art Project

30:43.142 --> 30:45.344
right before he was disgraced

30:45.377 --> 30:47.179
because of his politics.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.982
Now, Albert Harvey
also did a favor for Waltham,

30:50.016 --> 30:51.283
the guy that used
to own your building.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.419
He painted a mural
on one of the walls,

30:53.452 --> 30:54.987
but Waltham
chickened out.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.455
He painted over the mural

30:56.488 --> 30:58.958
when Harvey got hauled
in front of the HUAC--

30:58.991 --> 31:00.526
the House Un-American
Activities Committee.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.628
And then...

31:02.661 --> 31:05.497
everybody just kind
of forgot about it.

31:05.531 --> 31:09.235
Until I looked through Harvey's
sketchbook this afternoon.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.669
Um...

31:10.702 --> 31:12.604
what do you mean?
I mean

31:12.638 --> 31:15.541
I called the art restoration lab
at Columbia, we got one

31:15.574 --> 31:17.243
of your neighbors to let us
into your apartment building,

31:17.276 --> 31:19.211
and we took an
X-ray of the wall.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.315
Oh, my God.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.917
Oh, my God,

31:24.951 --> 31:27.920
it's gonna be beautiful
when they uncover it.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.455
Because that will
make your building

31:29.488 --> 31:33.225
a historical landmark,
and they cannot tear it down.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.927
Oh, my God!

31:34.961 --> 31:36.362
This is amazing.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.496
You're amazing.
(chuckles)

31:46.472 --> 31:48.140
It was one of those moments

31:48.174 --> 31:50.342
when it felt like
it was all right there.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.319
What's wrong?

32:00.352 --> 32:02.454
I want this.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.657
Shauna, I do.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.494
But I really don't want
to mess it up again.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.634
There are things about my life
that I can't tell you about.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.005
What can you tell me about?

32:19.038 --> 32:21.507
(chuckles softly)

32:21.540 --> 32:23.976
BRIAN:
...thieving your clothes
and imitating your...

32:24.010 --> 32:26.312
SHAUNA:
...which she also used,
and I had to pull hair

32:26.345 --> 32:28.114
off of it once, which was
just kind of the limit.
BRIAN: Oh, my God.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.249
Why do you still live
with this person?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.518
This person who wants
to be you so bad.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.020
She makes
such good brownies.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.754
Is that why? Wait,
what kind of brownies?

32:35.787 --> 32:38.424
SHAUNA:
...real stuff.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.028
She asked
about you a lot.

32:42.061 --> 32:45.231
My mom loved you, Brian.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.233
It was right then
that I realized

32:47.266 --> 32:49.035
that the pill wore off
hours ago.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.769
She was talking to Brian.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.771
Just Brian.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.007
(birds chirping)

32:55.807 --> 32:57.376
(gasps)

32:57.409 --> 32:59.445
MIKE: Sorry to
interrupt.
Oh.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.413
Harris needs you
in the Bronx.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.282
All right. Yeah.
Brian?

33:03.315 --> 33:05.451
This is, uh... this is Mike.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.653
He's from my work,
and he's got a key.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.356
(snapping fingers)
All right, all right.
I got to change my shirt.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.091
Look,

33:12.124 --> 33:14.593
I'm sorry. I got to go.
But I'll see you tonight.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.466
(exhales)

33:20.499 --> 33:23.169
REBECCA:
The cell phone Ramos used
to contact Makinin

33:23.202 --> 33:25.504
sent its last
backup to the cloud

33:25.537 --> 33:27.573
on the same day that
Ramos disappeared.

33:27.606 --> 33:31.510
The last location its GPS
recorded was that street corner.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.779
Wasn't Ray Dixon killed
near here?

33:33.812 --> 33:35.181
Weird, right?
Yeah.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.415
Ramos disappears
right around here,

33:36.448 --> 33:37.383
and, six months later,

33:37.416 --> 33:40.519
Ray Dixon is found murdered
two blocks away?

33:40.552 --> 33:41.720
I don't know. There's
something we're missing.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.756
There's some
connection.
(sighs)

33:51.630 --> 33:53.632
BRIAN:
Something like that?

34:04.576 --> 34:06.578
My God.

34:08.747 --> 34:13.119
So you think this
is Ramos' hideout?

34:13.152 --> 34:15.587
Tiovola is the company that
used to pay Johan Makinin

34:15.621 --> 34:18.124
to kill people for Ramos.
Mm-hmm.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.525
I went through
everything they hold.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.128
Three years ago, they bought
a condo on Ludlow Street.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.129
Guess who lives there.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.531
Randy Moore.
That's right.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.434
The NYPD task force
was working with Ramos.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.635
They're dirty.

34:29.668 --> 34:30.669
NAZ:
So where the hell is Ramos now?

34:34.140 --> 34:35.607
REBECCA:
Oh, my God.

34:35.641 --> 34:39.611
Well, looks like we
found Marco Ramos.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.218
(indistinct police transmission)

34:50.756 --> 34:53.125
REBECCA:
None of the task force
showed up this morning.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.393
We think
they're all on the run.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.495
How long have they
been on the take?
As far as we can tell,

34:56.528 --> 34:58.597
it started right after
they formed the task force.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.133
When Marco Ramos started
to think about making a deal

35:01.167 --> 35:03.269
with us, they knew their lives
were on the line.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.170
They killed him,

35:04.203 --> 35:05.137
and they let the fact
that people thought

35:05.171 --> 35:07.739
he was still out there
keep the money flowing.

35:07.773 --> 35:08.874
Eventually, they would have let
the body turn up

35:08.907 --> 35:10.342
and taken credit
for finding him.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.877
One of the guys
in Moore's task force

35:11.910 --> 35:14.213
was a sniper with the Rangers.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.215
Uh, we figure
he mimicked La Cebra.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.850
And when Dixon got too close,
they killed him.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.852
Moore's team couldn't find
the real La Cebra though.

35:20.886 --> 35:21.887
So when Brian did,

35:21.920 --> 35:24.256
they knew we'd get to the truth
soon and they ran.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.158
Best guess: they headed
for non-extradition countries.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.926
Once we track them,

35:27.959 --> 35:30.796
we can make them stand
trial in our jurisdiction.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.731
So let's find them.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.733
(phone chimes)

35:35.767 --> 35:38.270
BRIAN:
Quick question.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.872
Is there a hotline we can call
if we need a fighter jet?

35:40.906 --> 35:42.874
(scoffs)

35:42.908 --> 35:44.543
REBECCA:
Why exactly do we
need fighter jets?

35:44.576 --> 35:46.845
Moore and his guys need to get
out of the country, right?

35:46.878 --> 35:49.881
Fast and someplace
we can't touch them.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.184
Puno Airlines,
Flight 232

35:52.218 --> 35:53.519
from JFK to Caracas.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.654
It's the only direct flight
to Venezuela today,

35:55.687 --> 35:58.357
and, as you can see,
it's already en route.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.360
Now, Venezuela's not technically
a non-extradition country,

36:01.393 --> 36:03.629
but the treaty never gets
enforced.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.830
It might as well be.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.498
These guys are affiliated
with a cartel.

36:06.532 --> 36:07.299
There's no way they're gonna run

36:07.333 --> 36:08.934
by jumping
on a commercial flight.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.602
They're not on the flight.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.604
They're under it.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.406
Now, this

36:14.440 --> 36:16.875
is a charter plane,
provided by the cartel.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.810
And I'm betting they've got
hot flight attendants,

36:18.844 --> 36:20.912
fully reclining seats,
warm nuts--

36:20.946 --> 36:22.848
the whole deal.
And if they wanted

36:22.881 --> 36:25.884
to take this out of the country,
they could take off

36:25.917 --> 36:28.487
without a flight plan
and turn off their transponder.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.656
Problem is, they're
still traceable by radar.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.990
Unless...

36:32.023 --> 36:33.592
They're flying so close
to the bigger plane

36:33.625 --> 36:36.228
that they look like
one signal on the radar.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.963
I got the idea from Miami Vice.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.965
*

36:39.998 --> 36:41.933
All right, come here.
Look at Flight 232.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.802
Now, nothing out
of the ordinary, right?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.971
Until
you overlay

36:46.004 --> 36:49.241
a real-time thermal loop from
the National Weather Service's

36:49.275 --> 36:50.376
satellite.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.910
See that?

36:51.943 --> 36:54.580
Okay, Flight 232 is traveling
at the same speed

36:54.613 --> 36:57.316
as every other jet in the sky,
but there's

36:57.349 --> 36:59.251
two times the amount
of exhaust.

36:59.285 --> 37:00.886
There are two planes up there.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.888
We're on the clock.

37:02.921 --> 37:06.258
I mean, that plane leaves U.S.
airspace in about 30 minutes.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.559
So...

37:07.593 --> 37:11.663
how 'bout those fighter jets,
huh?

37:11.697 --> 37:12.898
REPORTER:
A dramatic scene today,

37:12.931 --> 37:15.000
as Air Force jets
intercepted a plane

37:15.033 --> 37:17.002
that was taking
four rogue NYPD officers...

37:17.035 --> 37:19.838
Uh, my day was awesome,
man. Thanks for asking.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.640
My night looks
promising, too.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.609
I was glad to see you and
Shauna the other night.

37:23.642 --> 37:26.278
Yeah. You know, I'm hoping
you'll see a lot more of us.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.513
Cheers.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.684
(door opens)

37:44.363 --> 37:46.432
Can I help you with something?

37:46.465 --> 37:47.499
You absolutely can.

37:47.533 --> 37:48.934
Quite a few things, in fact.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.837
My name's Sands.

37:51.870 --> 37:55.607
Just "Sands," huh?
No first name or...

37:55.641 --> 37:58.477
You can call me Mr. Sands,
if you like.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.446
It's fitting.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.550
I'm your new boss.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.552
(chuckles)

38:06.585 --> 38:08.987
I work for the FBI.

38:09.020 --> 38:12.057
You were placed in the FBI.

38:12.090 --> 38:15.361
You work for
the same man I do.

38:15.394 --> 38:18.029
Mr. Morra's a great man,

38:18.063 --> 38:21.099
and he envisions great
things for the world.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.535
But to get there,

38:23.569 --> 38:25.904
he needs men like me.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.910
I'm gonna give you jobs to do,
Brian.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.111
What kind of jobs?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.113
When I give you
an assignment,

38:35.146 --> 38:36.982
you will do it exactly the way
I tell you to.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.451
Otherwise I'll take steps
to ensure

38:39.485 --> 38:41.653
that you do it correctly
the next time.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.122
Is this about my dad?

38:44.155 --> 38:45.724
That woman

38:45.757 --> 38:47.726
said she was just a nurse.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.729
She is a nurse, mate.
She injects things.

38:50.762 --> 38:55.100
She injects
whatever I tell her to inject.

38:56.134 --> 38:59.070
Besides,

38:59.104 --> 39:02.574
who's to say it's your father
I'd go after?

39:02.608 --> 39:06.778
There is no one you
call family or friends

39:06.812 --> 39:09.114
who I can't touch.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.650
It's a tough thing
to get used to,

39:11.683 --> 39:15.854
the idea that your life
isn't yours anymore.

39:17.055 --> 39:20.626
But you belong to
Mr. Morra now, which means

39:20.659 --> 39:23.094
you belong to me.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.633
Enjoy your date with Shauna.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.385
Brian.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.190
What's wrong?

39:52.223 --> 39:55.427
Brian?

39:55.461 --> 39:57.128
Brian?
REBECCA:
Brian?

39:57.162 --> 39:59.965
You haven't been
picking up your phone.

39:59.998 --> 40:03.635
One of Moore's guys, Rodriguez,
he agreed to be a witness.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.704
They're going away...

40:07.906 --> 40:09.875
What's wrong?

40:09.908 --> 40:12.878
Uh...

40:12.911 --> 40:16.515
I had to, uh, break off
things with Shauna.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.551
She didn't take it very well.

40:21.687 --> 40:25.156
I think I hurt her
pretty bad. (sniffles)

40:26.157 --> 40:28.460
What happened?

40:28.494 --> 40:32.430
What, are we at
the "relationship advice" stage?

40:33.532 --> 40:36.535
Well, we kind of have to be.

40:38.069 --> 40:41.072
I'm the only one
you can talk to.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.644
I just, um...

40:46.912 --> 40:51.449
I don't really have control
over my life right now.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.520
(sighs)

40:54.553 --> 40:56.054
Things are...

40:56.087 --> 40:59.090
pretty complicated.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.128
I get it.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.168
Okay.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.162
Beer o'clock?

41:46.171 --> 41:47.873
(chuckles)
