WEBVTT

00:06.055 --> 00:08.555
- So, now you
know the truth.

00:08.655 --> 00:10.455
I'm just like you.

00:10.555 --> 00:11.688
I don't believe it.

00:11.788 --> 00:13.322
I mean, I believe it.

00:13.422 --> 00:15.188
I just thought
it was Robbie.

00:15.288 --> 00:17.055
Is Robbie
an android, too?

00:17.155 --> 00:18.055
Are there more?

00:18.155 --> 00:19.755
Is everyone an android,
except me?

00:19.855 --> 00:22.222
Am I an android,
but just don't know it?

00:22.322 --> 00:23.288
- Are you okay?

00:23.388 --> 00:24.288
Did the water hit you?

00:24.388 --> 00:25.988
It can fry
your circuits, you know?

00:26.088 --> 00:28.122
- I know. Yours, too.

00:28.222 --> 00:29.322
- I have to go.

00:29.422 --> 00:30.922
- Are we all androids
being secretly controlled

00:31.022 --> 00:32.822
by humans watching
us from afar?

00:32.922 --> 00:34.388
- Dayton Reyes!
- Oh, right!

00:34.488 --> 00:36.888
- Andrew LaPierre,
who made you?

00:36.988 --> 00:38.755
And how did you
know about me?

00:38.855 --> 00:40.288
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.155
- I can't tell
you that, either.

00:42.255 --> 00:43.355
Just trust me.

00:43.455 --> 00:44.688
It's for the best.

00:44.788 --> 00:46.422
- All right.
- What?

00:49.655 --> 00:50.788
- And whatever you do,

00:50.888 --> 00:52.788
you can't let your
mother know about me.

00:52.888 --> 00:54.022
Please?

00:59.122 --> 01:00.522
- Will!

01:00.622 --> 01:01.822
- What? We always
snuggle at the movies.

01:01.922 --> 01:03.855
- Dad! You're
blocking the view.

01:03.955 --> 01:05.422
- Fine.

01:10.755 --> 01:12.388
- Did you see that?
- No, should I rewind?

01:12.488 --> 01:13.722
- No. Outside.
A boy running away.

01:13.822 --> 01:15.488
Something's going on with
Frankie, I can feel it.

01:15.588 --> 01:16.622
I'm going in.
- I'm going, too.

01:16.722 --> 01:17.722
- I'm gonna catch up.

01:17.822 --> 01:19.522
In case we have to
make a quick exit,

01:19.622 --> 01:20.788
I'll be
the getaway driver.

01:20.888 --> 01:22.088
The movie's almost over.

01:22.188 --> 01:24.388
I wanna see if the arty
girl from the broken home

01:24.488 --> 01:25.788
slow dances with
the all-state wrestler

01:25.888 --> 01:27.355
who's more-than-
just-a-jock.

01:32.155 --> 01:34.355
- Just making sure no water
got on your clothes.

01:36.088 --> 01:37.755
It can still soak
through and get you wet.

01:37.855 --> 01:39.322
- I think I'm fine...

01:39.422 --> 01:40.855
Thanks to
Andrew LaPierre.

01:40.955 --> 01:42.955
- What kind of a horrible
person would...

01:43.055 --> 01:44.888
What am I saying?
It's gotta be Tammy.

01:44.988 --> 01:47.855
- Perhaps you're correct,
but your logic is faulty.

01:47.955 --> 01:50.055
The water could only hit
the person standing beneath it,

01:50.155 --> 01:52.522
and Tammy had no way
of knowing it'd be me.

01:52.622 --> 01:54.388
She didn't know
I'd win the contest.

01:54.488 --> 01:55.722
- That's true, but...

01:55.755 --> 01:56.988
- It's likely just
a practical joke.

01:57.088 --> 01:58.188
Hey, are you okay?

01:58.288 --> 02:01.488
- I am, but my costume
is quite damaged.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.022
- It still looks
cute on you, though.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.358
Ahem!

02:05.559 --> 02:07.292
- Are you sick?
Are you choking?

02:07.459 --> 02:09.025
Do you need
the Heimlich maneuver?

02:09.125 --> 02:10.459
- No, no, I'm good.

02:10.559 --> 02:12.459
- Where's Andrew?
Did he come back here, too?

02:12.525 --> 02:14.025
- Andrew...
had to leave.

02:14.125 --> 02:15.025
- He ran out on you?

02:15.125 --> 02:16.225
What a guy.

02:16.325 --> 02:18.659
- Andrew saved me.

02:21.192 --> 02:22.459
- Frankie,
come get your prize.

02:22.525 --> 02:23.525
Everyone's waiting.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.625
- That's right.
Come on.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.792
- Sepulveda peeps,

02:32.892 --> 02:36.259
let me hear it for the winner
of our emoji costume contest...

02:36.359 --> 02:37.892
Frankie Gaines!

02:37.992 --> 02:39.559
Clapping hands emoji!

02:41.525 --> 02:43.459
- And here's your
grand prize...

02:43.492 --> 02:46.025
A gift certificate
good for a day of fun

02:46.125 --> 02:49.459
at Rancho de la Playa's
favorite mini-golf course...

02:49.492 --> 02:51.559
Putt Me Some Slack!

02:52.892 --> 02:55.492
- Now, who's ready
to dance some more?

02:55.592 --> 02:58.092
Flamenco dancer emoji!

02:58.192 --> 02:59.159
- Hang on a second.

02:59.259 --> 03:00.825
If anyone has
any information

03:00.925 --> 03:03.159
about the perpetrator
of this prank,

03:03.259 --> 03:05.325
I urge you to come
forward now.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.459
- What's with you?
- I know it was Tammy.

03:07.559 --> 03:08.759
- Really?
- Really.

03:08.859 --> 03:10.259
No one
knows a thing?

03:10.359 --> 03:11.659
- Do you have any proof?
- No.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.925
Not one of you?

03:13.025 --> 03:16.459
- I just know it.
- No one knows anything?

03:16.492 --> 03:18.125
Fine.

03:18.225 --> 03:20.559
I have other methods.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.292
Get the scent,
Felina Gomez.

03:23.459 --> 03:25.659
Go ahead. Come on.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.925 --> 03:48.692
- Whoa-oh! No.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.525
We're going back
to the car.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.259
- No, I have to
stay and find

03:52.359 --> 03:54.692
my more-than-just-
a-jock soulmate.

03:56.292 --> 03:58.192
- Okay, Sepulveda, that's gonna
do for the Emoji Dance.

03:58.292 --> 03:59.692
Hope you had a great time!

03:59.792 --> 04:01.692
We'll see you guys
next time! Later!

04:06.325 --> 04:08.825
- So, did you have a good
time, Frankie Gaines?

04:08.925 --> 04:11.325
- I did, Cole Reyes.
How about you?

04:11.459 --> 04:13.992
- I had a really
good time.

04:14.092 --> 04:15.959
Hey, I was thinking...

04:16.059 --> 04:18.858
maybe we could hang out
together some time...

04:18.959 --> 04:21.591
like Tuesday...
after school?

04:21.692 --> 04:23.825
- I think I would enjoy hanging
out with you on Tuesday.

04:23.925 --> 04:25.525
- So, can I walk
you home?

04:25.625 --> 04:28.192
- No, you cannot.
- Oh.

04:28.292 --> 04:29.459
- My family is
waiting outside.

04:29.525 --> 04:30.992
I should probably
go to them now.

04:31.092 --> 04:32.725
- Oh, okay.

04:32.825 --> 04:34.692
Uh, I'll see you
at school.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.725
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Cole Reyes.

04:40.559 --> 04:42.225
- She's not who you
think she is, you know?

04:42.325 --> 04:43.625
- What's that
supposed to mean?

04:43.725 --> 04:45.059
- You'll see.

05:05.749 --> 05:07.516
- Are you going
to tell your mom?

05:07.616 --> 05:09.016
- No, I am not.

05:09.116 --> 05:10.783
- Don't you think
she should know

05:10.883 --> 05:12.316
there's another
android at school?

05:12.483 --> 05:15.116
- But Andrew specifically
asked me not to tell her.

05:15.216 --> 05:16.849
- So? Doesn't that
make you suspicious?

05:16.949 --> 05:19.049
- No. He saved me.

05:19.149 --> 05:20.816
He has proven to be
a noble android.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.883
- Yeah, but this
is huge.

05:22.983 --> 05:24.549
You have to tell her.

05:24.649 --> 05:26.816
- He asked me to
trust him and I do.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.783
Goodnight, Dayton Reyes.

05:42.749 --> 05:43.849
Are you okay, Frankie?

05:43.949 --> 05:45.049
Do you need help?

05:45.149 --> 05:46.983
I'm... almost there.

05:47.083 --> 05:48.783
I got it.

05:48.883 --> 05:51.716
- So? How was it?
- Fun.

05:51.816 --> 05:52.983
- That's all?

05:53.083 --> 05:54.283
- Give us the deets...

05:54.383 --> 05:56.749
Food, tunes, outfits,
drama, drama, drama.

05:56.849 --> 05:58.383
- I danced many dances.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.483
- And?

05:59.583 --> 06:01.283
- And I won the prize
for best costume...

06:01.383 --> 06:03.116
A gift certificate
to mini-golf.

06:03.216 --> 06:05.516
I haven't researched
mini-golf yet.

06:05.616 --> 06:06.883
Is it merely
the game of golf,

06:06.983 --> 06:08.883
but shrunken to
a microscopic size?

06:08.983 --> 06:10.383
Pretty close, Frankie.

06:10.483 --> 06:13.916
- Come on, I wanna know
everything that happened.

06:14.016 --> 06:16.083
Can I watch her memory
files when we get home?

06:16.183 --> 06:17.316
No, Jenny.

06:17.483 --> 06:20.483
Your sister's files are
for scientific research,

06:20.583 --> 06:22.249
not for your amusement.

06:26.816 --> 06:29.516
- Oh, boy,
a car full of pouters.

06:29.616 --> 06:31.483
Emergency plan
in full effect.

06:31.549 --> 06:33.549
Who wants to stop for
donuts on the way home?

06:33.649 --> 06:35.283
- SIGOURNEY, JENNY,
FRANKIE: Me!

06:35.383 --> 06:37.249
Hello?

06:37.349 --> 06:39.383
Anybody home?

06:55.283 --> 06:57.583
When did you get home?

06:58.949 --> 07:01.116
What did you do?

07:02.483 --> 07:04.183
♪ Sittin' in a cage

07:04.283 --> 07:06.783
♪ Ain't got
nothin' to do ♪

07:06.883 --> 07:09.149

07:19.483 --> 07:22.549
It's about time
you schmo-hawks showed up.

07:22.649 --> 07:24.816
I need care
and maintenance.

07:24.916 --> 07:27.949
My battery is low
and I need charging, stat!

07:28.049 --> 07:29.249
What...

07:29.349 --> 07:30.983
what are you going
to do with that cat?

07:31.083 --> 07:32.883
- You don't wanna give us
any info about that android.

07:32.983 --> 07:34.816
We thought maybe you'd
be more likely to talk,

07:34.916 --> 07:36.783
if you had
a little... friend.

07:36.883 --> 07:39.483
- No, I'm not
a cat person.

07:41.149 --> 07:43.816
- Hey, knock it off,
fish breath.

07:43.916 --> 07:45.649
I'm not a cat toy, you know?

07:45.749 --> 07:47.916
Oh. Oh. Oh. Help.

07:48.016 --> 07:50.516
He-e-e-elp!

07:51.783 --> 07:53.016
- How did this happen?

07:53.116 --> 07:54.583
- I don't know. Honest.
- Andrew, I programmed you.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.983
I can tell when you're lying.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.549
Okay, I got wet.

07:58.649 --> 08:00.483
A bunch of guys were
havin' a water fight,

08:00.583 --> 08:01.616
and I got carried away.

08:01.716 --> 08:03.016
- Why did you
lie to me?

08:03.116 --> 08:05.216
- I didn't want
you to be mad at me.

08:05.316 --> 08:07.483
- Well, I am mad,
Andrew.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.683
I didn't give you
a state-of-the-art CPU

08:09.783 --> 08:11.016
for your amusement.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.083
You've gotta be
more careful.

08:12.183 --> 08:13.716
You're in the real world.

08:13.816 --> 08:14.983
You don't live
in a lab anymore.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.916
- I know, Dad.

08:17.016 --> 08:18.216
I'm sorry.

08:18.316 --> 08:19.783
- Don't call me "Dad."
You're a machine.

08:19.883 --> 08:21.849
Call me James
or Dr. Peters, PhD,

08:21.949 --> 08:25.316
MSEE, AACG?
- What's AACG?

08:25.483 --> 08:27.883
- It stands for
All Around Cool Guy.

08:27.983 --> 08:30.683
I just made it up, myself.

08:30.783 --> 08:32.982
Anyway, let's go
with "Dr. Peters."

08:33.082 --> 08:34.183
Now let me fix your arm.

08:34.283 --> 08:36.149
You'll probably
just mess it up.

08:40.149 --> 08:41.482
And then what happened?

08:41.515 --> 08:43.015
- Then I danced with Cole again.
- Then what?

08:43.116 --> 08:44.883
- Then the DJ announced that
I won the costume contest.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.049
- Uh-huh. Then what?

08:46.149 --> 08:47.816
- Then I went on stage
to collect my prize.

08:47.916 --> 08:49.183
- Uh-huh. Then what?

08:49.283 --> 08:51.149
- Then someone tried to dump
a bucket of water on me,

08:51.249 --> 08:53.583
but Andrew dove onto the stage
and pushed me out of the way.

08:53.683 --> 08:55.383
The water hit him,
then his arm started smoking,

08:55.483 --> 08:57.216
and shorting out because
he's an android, too.

08:57.316 --> 08:59.849
- Uh-huh. Then wha...

08:59.949 --> 09:03.516
Wait. There's
another android?

09:03.616 --> 09:05.049
You didn't tell mom?

09:05.149 --> 09:06.583
- He made me promise
I wouldn't.

09:06.683 --> 09:07.783
- Why?
- I don't know.

09:07.883 --> 09:09.216
But you can't
tell, either.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.349
Promise me, Jenny Gaines.

09:11.483 --> 09:13.649
- So, you're saying
this will be our secret.

09:13.749 --> 09:16.316
- Yes.
- Yes! I love secrets!

09:18.549 --> 09:19.516
What?

09:19.616 --> 09:21.183
- Aren't you gonna
ask me "Then what?"

09:21.283 --> 09:22.516
- Oh, yeah. Then what?

09:22.616 --> 09:23.983
- Then Ms. Hough
brought Felina Gomez

09:24.083 --> 09:26.616
out to search for
the prank perpetrator.

09:31.649 --> 09:33.983
- Hey, my breakfast.
- Don't touch. That's mine.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.383
You're a machine,
remember?

09:36.483 --> 09:37.283
- So I've heard.

09:37.383 --> 09:39.183
I still like the smell.

09:40.249 --> 09:42.816
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
My tongue's burning up.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.616
- Well, I'm headin' out.
Have a good one.

09:44.716 --> 09:46.816
Make sure you're home early.

09:46.916 --> 09:49.849
- Sorry. What was that?
- I said...

09:49.949 --> 09:52.016
I said, make sure
you're home early.

09:52.116 --> 09:53.349
- Do we have something
scheduled for today...

09:53.449 --> 09:56.183
Like a defrag
or a battery replacement,

09:56.283 --> 09:58.016
upgrade to
the software system?

09:58.116 --> 09:59.916
- I'm implementing
a new protocol.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.349
At the end of every day,

10:01.449 --> 10:03.349
I wanna have a look
at your memory files.

10:03.449 --> 10:05.016
Think of it as
a house rule.

10:05.116 --> 10:07.216
- Is this because of what
happened at the dance,

10:07.316 --> 10:09.749
'cause that was just...
- This is not open for debate,

10:09.849 --> 10:11.449
and I'm not going
to explain myself.

10:11.549 --> 10:14.049
I want to know what you're doing
and who you're doing it with

10:14.149 --> 10:16.449
for the foreseeable future,
is that clear?

10:16.549 --> 10:20.683
Good. Now make sure you come
home right after school today.

10:29.839 --> 10:31.739
- Uh, good morning,
Ms. Hough.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.173
- Is it a good
morning, Tammy?

10:34.273 --> 10:36.239
I'm sorry.

10:36.339 --> 10:37.706
I'm just preoccupied.

10:37.806 --> 10:39.539
I simply don't know
what's going on

10:39.639 --> 10:40.806
in this school anymore.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.506
- Well, if there's anything
we can do to help...

10:43.606 --> 10:46.839
- Just keep your eyes and your
ears and your noses open,

10:46.939 --> 10:48.973
and report any funny
business to me.

10:50.273 --> 10:51.673
- What's that,
Felina Gomez?

10:51.773 --> 10:54.473
They're clean?
Of course, they are.

10:54.573 --> 10:57.773
They are some of Sepulveda's
best students.

10:57.839 --> 11:00.339
Come along, we will
crack this case.

11:00.439 --> 11:02.473
As you were, ladies.

11:04.773 --> 11:05.939
Ridiculous.

11:06.039 --> 11:08.439
Whoever heard of picking
up a scent from water?

11:08.539 --> 11:10.239
- Actually, the hydrogen
molecules in water

11:10.339 --> 11:12.906
are a perfect receptor for
bonding with the human scent.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.606
- Which is your case is...

11:14.773 --> 11:16.506
laundry detergent,
peanut butter,

11:16.606 --> 11:18.806
with a hint of day-old
nacho cheese.

11:18.906 --> 11:20.673
- As long as you two keep
your mouths shut,

11:20.773 --> 11:22.606
I have nothing
to worry about.

11:22.773 --> 11:24.639
But now I have to find
another way to prove

11:24.773 --> 11:25.773
that Frankie's a robot.

11:25.839 --> 11:26.973
- Can't you just
let it go?

11:27.073 --> 11:29.473
Frankie could be a troll,
for all I care.

11:29.573 --> 11:30.806
We need her brain
for state's.

11:30.906 --> 11:33.206
- How can you think about
state's at a time like this?

11:33.306 --> 11:35.606
There's something really
weird going on around here.

11:35.773 --> 11:39.606
Am I the only one who cares?

11:43.606 --> 11:45.073
- Greetings,
Sepulvedites.

11:45.173 --> 11:46.039
Sorry to interrupt
your day,

11:46.139 --> 11:47.973
but I have
an important message.

11:48.073 --> 11:49.539
I want everyone to know

11:49.639 --> 11:51.839
I had nothing to do with
the night of the rampage.

11:51.939 --> 11:54.206
I love our school
and would never harm anyone,

11:54.306 --> 11:55.439
or anything in it.

11:55.539 --> 11:58.206
I'm the victim
of a rush-to-judgment.

11:58.306 --> 11:59.839
And if Ms. Hough
can do it to me,

11:59.939 --> 12:01.606
who says she won't
do it to you, too?

12:01.773 --> 12:03.973
I call on you,
my fellow students,

12:04.073 --> 12:06.473
to join the Justice
for Robbie Movement,

12:06.573 --> 12:08.973
and now a song.

12:14.473 --> 12:16.673
♪ Principal accused me
but I think she's confused me ♪

12:16.773 --> 12:18.773
♪ What they did to the school,
I wouldn't do it ♪

12:18.873 --> 12:20.606
♪ That's totally uncool
to go breakin' in the lockers ♪

12:20.773 --> 12:22.073
♪ And I hate really
to mock her ♪

12:22.173 --> 12:24.506
♪ But she didn't have a reason
to send me to prison ♪

12:26.073 --> 12:28.439
♪ You know that
it's the time for justice ♪

12:28.539 --> 12:29.873
♪ Justice for Robbie

12:29.973 --> 12:31.106
♪ Justice

12:31.206 --> 12:33.239
♪ Justice for Robbie ♪

12:36.506 --> 12:39.173
- Oh, stop looking
at me like that.

12:40.673 --> 12:43.173
- You know, it's great
you can eat now.

12:43.273 --> 12:44.839
But if you wanna fit in,

12:44.939 --> 12:46.373
maybe don't be
so excited about

12:46.473 --> 12:49.773
eating Sepulveda's
infamous mystery meat.

12:49.806 --> 12:51.106
- Understood,
Dayton Reyes.

12:51.206 --> 12:53.106
- Hey, did you see
Robbie's broadcast?

12:53.206 --> 12:55.606
- I did. Do you still
believe he's an android?

12:55.773 --> 12:56.906
- I don't know
what to believe.

12:57.006 --> 12:58.773
But do you think
he's really innocent?

12:58.873 --> 13:00.439
- I was wrongly
accused by Ms. Hough,

13:00.539 --> 13:02.439
so the same thing
could happen to Robbie.

13:02.539 --> 13:04.073
Are you doing school
work while eating?

13:04.173 --> 13:06.206
I didn't know you had
parallel processing power.

13:06.306 --> 13:07.539
Impressive multitasking.

13:07.639 --> 13:10.006
- No, I'm just trying
to sort everything out.

13:10.106 --> 13:12.839
First, there was
the "Robots Rule" graffiti,

13:12.939 --> 13:15.106
then the night of rampage,

13:15.206 --> 13:16.773
then the water dump,

13:16.839 --> 13:19.006
and then we find
out about Andrew.

13:19.106 --> 13:21.639
It all must be
connected, but how?

13:21.773 --> 13:23.639
- We need more data
to answer that question.

13:23.773 --> 13:25.673
- You're right.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.773
And I know just who
can give it to us.

13:35.339 --> 13:36.939
Andrew must be
the key.

13:37.039 --> 13:37.939
Think about it.

13:38.039 --> 13:39.639
We don't know
anything about him.

13:39.773 --> 13:41.806
If we figure out
who is behind him,

13:41.906 --> 13:44.106
I'll bet it will lead us
to everything that's going on.

13:44.206 --> 13:46.606
- A logical starting point
would be Andrew's home address...

13:46.773 --> 13:47.773
281 Baltic.

13:47.873 --> 13:49.473
- How far away
from school is that?

13:53.773 --> 13:55.039
- .7 miles one way.

13:55.139 --> 13:56.806
- We could easily make
it there and back

13:56.906 --> 13:58.139
before next period,
if we ran.

13:58.239 --> 14:01.273
Well, if you ran while
carrying me on your back.

14:01.373 --> 14:02.406
What do you say?

14:02.506 --> 14:03.839
- Is a reply necessary?

14:03.939 --> 14:05.273
You presented
inarguable facts.

14:05.373 --> 14:08.506
- No, I just mean...
Never mind. Let's go.

14:15.039 --> 14:17.773
- Whew, that was
quite the workout.

14:17.873 --> 14:21.339
Hey, holding onto you took
a lot of upper body strength.

14:22.839 --> 14:25.573
- This empty lot is
an unusual place of residence.

14:25.673 --> 14:27.506
- Are you sure this is
the right address?

14:27.606 --> 14:30.339
- Yes, 281 Baltic Street.

14:30.439 --> 14:31.973
What does Andrew
do when it rains?

14:32.073 --> 14:33.773
These are definitely
suboptimal conditions

14:33.806 --> 14:35.506
for android care
and maintenance.

14:35.606 --> 14:37.806
- The address in his
file must be a fake.

14:37.906 --> 14:40.139
Whoever made Andrew
must be hiding something.

14:40.239 --> 14:41.239
- But who made Andrew?

14:41.339 --> 14:43.839
- I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

14:47.939 --> 14:49.439
- According to
popular myth,

14:49.539 --> 14:51.973
Ponce de León was searching
for the Fountain of Youth

14:52.073 --> 14:53.373
when he explored Florida.

14:53.473 --> 14:56.539
But there's nothing
in the historical records

14:56.639 --> 14:57.673
that supports
this claim.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.173
- I object to this,
Dayton Reyes.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.106
- Come on, Frankie,
it's for your own good.

15:02.206 --> 15:04.773
- But I told Andrew LaPierre
that I would trust him.

15:04.873 --> 15:08.006
- You did,
but I didn't.

15:10.873 --> 15:12.039
- I think he saw us.

15:12.139 --> 15:14.573
- It's okay. He won't
get away this time.

15:14.673 --> 15:16.773
- Andrew, what do you
think you're doing?

15:16.873 --> 15:19.339
The window
is not a door.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.839
- That's it.
No more Miss Nice Dayton.

15:24.939 --> 15:27.073
- Who is Miss Nice Dayton?
A new teacher?

15:27.173 --> 15:28.573
- No, it's me.

15:28.673 --> 15:30.473
- So, your first name is "Nice"
and your last name is "Dayton"?

15:30.573 --> 15:32.773
What about "Reyes"? Do you
have a hyphenated last name?

15:32.839 --> 15:34.506
- No, I just meant...
Never mind.

15:34.606 --> 15:35.939
I know what
we're gonna do.

15:36.039 --> 15:38.039
Meet me in electronics lab
after seventh period, okay?

15:38.139 --> 15:40.306
- Okay,
Miss Nice Dayton-Reyes.

15:44.106 --> 15:45.473
Hello, Cole Reyes.

15:45.573 --> 15:47.773
Or is it
Cole Dayton-Reyes?

15:47.839 --> 15:50.973
- Huh? Nope.
Just Cole Reyes.

15:51.073 --> 15:53.273
Looking forward
to our da...

15:53.373 --> 15:56.039
of hanging out tomorrow
after school.

15:56.139 --> 15:58.106
Are you stoked?
- I am, indeed, stoked.

15:58.206 --> 16:01.573
But I am unclear as to
what "hanging out" comprises.

16:01.673 --> 16:02.973
- We could go
out to eat.

16:03.073 --> 16:04.573
There's this
new restaurant

16:04.673 --> 16:05.906
that only serves
breakfast for dinner.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.773
But if you eat
breakfast in the morning,

16:15.873 --> 16:18.839
then dinner is what
you eat at night,

16:18.939 --> 16:21.773
I guess that is pretty funny.

16:21.839 --> 16:23.473
I hear their pancakes
are really good.

16:23.573 --> 16:24.873
- I love pancakes.

16:24.973 --> 16:27.873
I also love Sepulveda's
infamous mystery meat.

16:27.973 --> 16:30.273
Although Dayton told me that
I should not admit that.

16:30.373 --> 16:32.573
It's okay.

16:32.673 --> 16:34.273
I kinda like it, too.

16:34.373 --> 16:36.806
- Should we do an activity
before breakfast-for-dinner?

16:36.906 --> 16:37.939
- Sure. Like what?

16:38.039 --> 16:39.073
- How about mini-golf?

16:39.173 --> 16:41.206
- Sounds great,
but I'll warn ya,

16:41.306 --> 16:42.773
I'm a pretty serious
mini-golfer.

16:42.839 --> 16:44.073
- I've never played
any golf,

16:44.173 --> 16:45.839
mini or full-sized before.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.539
- Then I'll give
you some pointers.

16:47.639 --> 16:48.573
- I would appreciate that.

16:48.673 --> 16:50.773
- Great.
So it's a da...

16:50.806 --> 16:52.806
a plan.

16:52.906 --> 16:54.173
Mini-golf then
breakfast-for-dinner.

16:54.273 --> 16:55.773
- Hang out plan,
confirmed.

16:59.139 --> 17:01.573
- Well, I'm gonna
be late for class.

17:15.906 --> 17:18.106
- So, you and Frankie
have a hot date planned.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.173
It's not a date!

17:20.272 --> 17:22.373
- We're just hanging out
together after school.

17:23.673 --> 17:25.306
- Cole, you don't know
what you're getting into.

17:25.406 --> 17:28.039
As your friend, I owe
it to you to warn you.

17:28.138 --> 17:30.173
- Look, Tammy, I'm tired
of you hinting around

17:30.273 --> 17:32.006
that something's
up with Frankie.

17:32.106 --> 17:33.139
If you have
something to say,

17:33.239 --> 17:34.873
why don't you
come out and say it?

17:34.973 --> 17:37.206
- All right.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.373
I will.

17:42.306 --> 17:45.439
I'm almost a hundred
percent sure...

17:45.539 --> 17:46.973
that Frankie's not human.

17:47.073 --> 17:49.939
- What is she? An alien?

17:50.039 --> 17:52.339
- An alien? Come on,
Cole, be serious.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.773
- Frankie Gaines...

17:56.839 --> 17:58.906
is a robot.

18:04.075 --> 18:06.175
Oh, you're too
funny, Tammy.

18:06.275 --> 18:08.308
You really had me
going there for a minute.

18:09.842 --> 18:11.342
A robot.

18:12.742 --> 18:14.308
- Almost there.

18:14.408 --> 18:16.108
Okay, hit it.

18:19.775 --> 18:22.308
There she is...

18:22.408 --> 18:23.808
The GPS module.

18:23.908 --> 18:26.042
- Wouldn't it be simpler to
just follow Andrew LaPierre?

18:26.142 --> 18:27.842
- He's on the lookout
for us.

18:27.942 --> 18:29.408
We'd never pull it off.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.875
Besides, making our own tracking
device is way cooler.

18:32.975 --> 18:34.408
And we're done.

18:34.508 --> 18:36.808
All we have to do now
is plant it on Andrew.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.775
- How will we do that,
if he's avoiding us?

18:38.875 --> 18:41.508
- Don't worry,
I already have a plan.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.475
- Hello, ladies.

18:45.575 --> 18:46.508
- Hello, Carmen Hough.

18:46.608 --> 18:48.308
- That's Ms. E.
Carmen Hough to you.

18:48.408 --> 18:49.975
- Is Carmen
your middle name?

18:50.075 --> 18:51.875
Do you have a hyphenated
last name, too?

18:51.975 --> 18:53.608
- Well, as a matter of fact,
my full name

18:53.742 --> 18:57.375
is Esmerelda Carmen
Thelonious Hough the VII.

18:57.475 --> 18:59.542
You can see
why I shorted it.

18:59.642 --> 19:00.608
What are you two up to?

19:00.742 --> 19:03.975
- Oh, um, just, you know,
science stuff.

19:04.075 --> 19:05.308
How about you?

19:05.408 --> 19:07.642
- Felina's little wet nose
may have let me down,

19:07.742 --> 19:09.242
but I am not giving up.

19:09.342 --> 19:11.808
The janitor found this
hanging above the stage.

19:11.908 --> 19:13.942
I'm going to extract
evidence from it.

19:14.042 --> 19:16.375
Now off to the kitchen.
- What for?

19:16.475 --> 19:18.242
- Cornstarch and
a little fingerprint powder.

19:18.342 --> 19:20.108
I will find
the guilty party.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.608
Esmerelda Carmen Thelonious
Hough the VII

19:22.742 --> 19:24.742
always gets her man.

19:30.475 --> 19:32.742
- So, PEGSI, are you
ready to talk now,

19:32.775 --> 19:34.308
or do you wanna go again?

19:34.408 --> 19:35.942
We've got a calico
who really knows

19:36.042 --> 19:38.308
how to knock a mouse around.

19:38.408 --> 19:40.642
- Hey, robot,
I'm talkin' to you.

19:42.475 --> 19:43.742
Oh, no.

19:43.842 --> 19:45.175
Look what you did.

19:45.275 --> 19:46.742
That floating disco
ball is the only

19:46.775 --> 19:49.008
leverage we've
got on Kingston.

19:49.108 --> 19:50.275
We've gotta get him back.

19:50.375 --> 19:53.575
Come on, let's go get
somebody from IT.

19:53.675 --> 19:54.942
Just leave him.

19:55.042 --> 19:56.608
He's not goin'
anywhere.

20:01.908 --> 20:03.408
Chumps.

20:03.508 --> 20:06.742
I guess they've never
heard of playing e-possum.

20:11.275 --> 20:12.775
- Andrew LaPierre,
there you are.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.408
We have to talk.
- Sorry, no can do.

20:14.508 --> 20:15.675
I... I've gotta go.

20:15.775 --> 20:17.208
Oh!

20:17.308 --> 20:19.408
I am so sorry.

20:19.508 --> 20:21.475
I totally wasn't
looking where I was going.

20:21.575 --> 20:23.608
Let me help you up.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.608
Oh!

20:25.708 --> 20:27.242
I am such a klutz.

20:27.342 --> 20:29.542
My dad used to tell me,
"Byron, you're such a klutz."

20:29.642 --> 20:31.275
- I have no time.

20:34.675 --> 20:36.442
- Bravo, Byron.

20:36.542 --> 20:37.308
Nice job.

20:37.408 --> 20:38.642
- Thank you,
Byron Patrick.

20:38.742 --> 20:40.275
- No problem.

20:40.375 --> 20:43.042
- So, why'd you guys want me
to run into Andrew, anyway?

20:43.142 --> 20:45.075
- It's complicated,

20:45.175 --> 20:47.675
and involves an empty lot,
a piggyback ride,

20:47.775 --> 20:49.875
a soldering iron,
Felina Gomez...

20:49.975 --> 20:51.442
- No problem.
You can tell me later.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.108
I've gotta go.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.508
Where are you off to?

20:54.608 --> 20:57.308
- Oh, um, I'm putting all these
posters around the school.

21:03.308 --> 21:05.075
This better work.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.742
Andrew's on the move.

21:09.808 --> 21:12.742
Shall we?
- We shall.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.175
This is it.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.575
Look familiar?

21:19.742 --> 21:21.942
- It does not.

21:22.042 --> 21:24.475
- Well, here we go.

21:35.175 --> 21:36.275
Oh, no.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.508
This is not good.
- What?

21:41.275 --> 21:43.308
- How did you...

21:45.875 --> 21:47.275
- Andrew LaPierre,

21:47.375 --> 21:50.408
is James Peters
your father?
