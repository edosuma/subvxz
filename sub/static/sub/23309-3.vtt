00:01.850 --> 00:06.850
What's the difference between
justice and revenge?

00:09.510 --> 00:12.440
Some say justice is about finding balance.

00:12.740 --> 00:15.260
An attempt to return to equilibrium.

00:15.810 --> 00:19.700
Restoring order by delivering
the proportionate response.

00:22.140 --> 00:25.310
Others mistake inflicting pain as justice.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.700
They're wrong.

00:27.030 --> 00:29.619
Violence only corrupts order,

00:29.620 --> 00:32.409
the very balance they set out to restore.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.830
But I'm not here for justice.

00:38.740 --> 00:39.930
Not anymore.

00:42.260 --> 00:43.940
I want revenge.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.889
There are three bedrooms
upstairs, two more bathrooms,

00:53.890 --> 00:56.399
the master bedroom had the
patio restored recently.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.329
It's all up to code.

00:58.330 --> 01:01.219
Personally, I'd gut the place
from floor to ceiling.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.789
Renovate the whole thing.

01:02.790 --> 01:05.949
Even if you did nothing,
this place is a steal.

01:05.950 --> 01:08.499
Good neighborhood, great school district.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.849
There's even room for a pool.

01:09.850 --> 01:12.999
You can't deny the potential
investment opportunity.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.520
Why is it listed so low, then?

01:14.530 --> 01:16.460
I mean... somebody die in here?

01:16.780 --> 01:19.089
Uh, the owner... he fell on hard times.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.939
You know, he borrowed against the house,

01:20.940 --> 01:22.440
missed a few payments.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.470
My advice?

01:23.471 --> 01:25.260
Put in a lowball offer.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.440
The seller is out of options.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.940
Hey, honey pie.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.829
What are you doing here?

01:37.830 --> 01:39.300
I needed to see you.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.030
We've discussed this, Norman.

01:42.050 --> 01:44.000
It's been almost three weeks.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.830
Some space is a good thing.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.550
I missed you.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.300
Yeah, me too.

01:53.060 --> 01:55.180
But I'm doing what's best for our marriage.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.150
I want you to come home, Kate.

01:58.950 --> 02:01.220
We still have till the end of the month.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.680
- I can fix this.
- Enough, Norman.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.780
This isn't a problem that you can solve.

02:07.650 --> 02:09.109
We were screwed, okay?

02:09.110 --> 02:10.839
Bad things happen to good
people all the time,

02:10.840 --> 02:12.880
and there's nothing you can do about it.

02:12.950 --> 02:14.410
I got a plan, Kate.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.360
A way to fix everything.

02:18.530 --> 02:20.260
I won't let them take our house.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074

02:34.810 --> 02:36.460
Norman Wilkerson.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.969
Senior factory maintenance
mechanic at the Perkins plant

02:38.970 --> 02:41.769
for the past... 26 years?

02:41.770 --> 02:43.309
References are on the back.

02:43.310 --> 02:44.969
No doubt you're qualified, Norman.

02:44.970 --> 02:47.250
If anything, overqualified.

02:47.490 --> 02:49.220
You say that like it's a bad thing.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.989
So what made you decide to leave?

02:50.990 --> 02:51.990
I didn't.

02:52.740 --> 02:56.040
The plant was closed down
last year by Benedict Global.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.790
Part of its...

02:58.060 --> 02:59.850
corporate restructuring.

02:59.870 --> 03:01.179
You do realize this position

03:01.180 --> 03:03.379
is under the Benedict Global umbrella?

03:03.380 --> 03:04.950
Same holding company.

03:05.390 --> 03:06.600
You're fine with that?

03:07.070 --> 03:08.100
It's a job.

03:09.610 --> 03:12.740
My ego went out the window a long time ago.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.529
This old dog knows one trick...

03:15.530 --> 03:17.700
Fixing broken-down conveyor belts.

03:17.850 --> 03:18.870
Particular set of skills

03:18.880 --> 03:21.140
that's diminishing in demand every day.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.120
Can you get this to me tomorrow?

03:25.370 --> 03:27.349
I'll put in a good word
for you with corporate.

03:27.350 --> 03:29.680
They should make a decision
by the end of the month.

03:29.850 --> 03:30.850
Thank you.

03:31.060 --> 03:34.119
Think positive, be positive,

03:34.120 --> 03:36.840
and positive things will happen.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.280
Get in the damn trunk.

04:01.890 --> 04:03.159
Get in! Get in the trunk.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.320
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.

04:10.090 --> 04:12.760
Justice, revenge.

04:14.070 --> 04:15.509
All that matters

04:15.510 --> 04:18.839
is that the punishment is proportionate.

04:22.050 --> 04:23.610
So you tell me,

04:25.550 --> 04:27.300
how should you be punished?

04:28.020 --> 04:31.370
What's the appropriate penalty
for the pain you've caused?

04:33.270 --> 04:34.820
Hammurabi's code.

04:35.430 --> 04:36.790
An eye for an eye.

04:37.630 --> 04:39.090
Tooth for a tooth.

04:56.590 --> 04:57.610
Call you back.

04:58.460 --> 05:01.030
Christina Hart. It's been too long.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.159
Judging from that file,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.829
we're not exactly here to
catch up, are we, Valerie?

05:04.830 --> 05:07.710
Word is you've gained quite an
impressive portfolio of clients.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.279
I could use your expertise...

05:09.280 --> 05:10.579
and discretion.

05:10.580 --> 05:12.560
I don't know much about insurance.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.660
We're expanding into the K&R sector.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.420
Kidnapping and ransom.

05:17.490 --> 05:19.439
That's a very dangerous business, Valerie.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.830
It's also lucrative.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.270
Seems like someone gets taken
every day around here.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.579
Government official?

05:24.580 --> 05:25.670
An accountant.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.979
That sounds like a job for the police.

05:27.980 --> 05:29.640
I came to you for a reason.

05:30.210 --> 05:32.869
There's a $5 million indemnity policy.

05:32.870 --> 05:34.190
For an accountant?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.309
He runs the books for
private equity behemoth

05:36.310 --> 05:37.839
Benedict Global Management.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.070
Got abducted while getting in his car.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.259
There's no ransom demand yet,

05:41.260 --> 05:43.349
but we can't just sit on our hands.

05:43.350 --> 05:45.409
My firm is prepared to offer you $1 million

05:45.410 --> 05:47.189
to assist in the investigation.

05:47.190 --> 05:51.439
So we do all of the work,
you save $4 million,

05:51.440 --> 05:52.659
if all goes well.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.819
Like I said, it's a lucrative business.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.620
Who's your FBI point person?

05:56.630 --> 05:59.519
Client prefers not to lift up
their skirt for the authorities.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.549
Benedict Global specializes in
the restructuring of factories

06:02.550 --> 06:03.589
through leveraged buyouts.

06:03.590 --> 06:06.569
Acquiring a struggling business,
purging the employees,

06:06.570 --> 06:09.139
repurposing the plant,
flipping it for millions.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.060
Ruthless stuff.

06:10.061 --> 06:11.750
Oh, so you thought of me.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.730
I know how effective you can be.

06:14.970 --> 06:16.210
And I trust you.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.130
What do you say?

06:20.110 --> 06:21.900
A favor for an old asset?

06:29.470 --> 06:30.529
Who's the missing person?

06:30.530 --> 06:31.700
This guy, Samuel Patel.

06:31.710 --> 06:33.699
He's the lead accountant
at Benedict Global.

06:33.700 --> 06:34.670
A coworker started to worry

06:34.671 --> 06:36.379
when he didn't show up
to his morning meeting.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.729
Last time he was seen was in the elevator

06:37.730 --> 06:39.829
on the way to the employee
parking garage last night.

06:39.830 --> 06:40.810
Never made it home.

06:40.811 --> 06:42.389
- Married?
- Yeah, to his job.

06:42.390 --> 06:43.779
I mean, this guy's a total workaholic.

06:43.780 --> 06:45.209
Hasn't missed a day of
work since he started.

06:45.210 --> 06:47.529
Gets in at 5:00 A.M. Goes home at 7:00 P.M.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.369
Every single day, like clockwork.

06:49.370 --> 06:51.090
Stays longer on weekends.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.779
Guy should consider a career change.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.370
No, not this guy.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.749
He's got a mathematics
degree from Stanford,

06:55.750 --> 06:57.669
magna cum laude, MBA from Wharton.

06:57.670 --> 06:59.779
I mean, this guy's dedicated
every waking moment

06:59.780 --> 07:01.209
to landing a job at Benedict.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.770
You couldn't pay me enough.

07:03.150 --> 07:05.729
Corporate raiders will be the
death of the working class.

07:05.730 --> 07:07.180
Don't you mean robots?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.540
- What do you mean, robots?
- Robots, man.

07:09.770 --> 07:10.979
Sentient machinery.

07:10.980 --> 07:13.929
Do you know that Amazon
right now has 45,000 robots

07:13.930 --> 07:15.020
running their fulfillment centers,

07:15.030 --> 07:17.069
and they're gonna add another 20 next year?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.529
So if you don't want to
lose your job to a robot,

07:18.530 --> 07:20.759
you have to start fine-tuning
your social skills.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.199
Oh, like you, sunshine?

07:22.200 --> 07:23.550
That's clever. I get it.

07:23.850 --> 07:25.920
Why would Hart choose this case?

07:25.930 --> 07:26.470
I don't know.

07:26.471 --> 07:28.100
Because a man is in danger?

07:28.390 --> 07:29.879
This is what you signed up for.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.949
This guy's got a huge insurance policy,

07:31.950 --> 07:33.549
and there's still no ransom demand.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.520
Yeah, I don't think this is about a payoff.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.170
I think this is personal to someone.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.700
Where's my damn money?

07:47.530 --> 07:49.369
Please, let me go. You've
got the wrong guy.

07:49.370 --> 07:53.420
- I'm just an accountant.
- No, you're his accountant.

07:54.490 --> 07:57.600
How much does Benedict give
you to look the other way?

07:59.030 --> 08:01.290
What did you do with our pensions?

08:02.720 --> 08:04.900
Tell me the truth and you can go home.

08:06.190 --> 08:09.040
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Please, please, please.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.460
I want to hear you say his name.

08:13.110 --> 08:16.150
Who stole our pensions?

08:17.240 --> 08:18.240
Say it!

08:22.150 --> 08:24.370
Lester Benedict.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.170
Now,

08:30.780 --> 08:32.700
I want to hear how he did it.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.620
No sign of a struggle.

08:41.970 --> 08:43.960
Because Patel never saw it coming.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.079
Kidnapper was waiting for him.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.489
There's multiple ways
to access this garage.

08:48.490 --> 08:49.490
Why here?

08:49.790 --> 08:51.050
No cameras.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.819
But still, parking garages are risky.

08:53.820 --> 08:55.149
A pro would never pick this place.

08:55.150 --> 08:56.179
People coming in, people going out...

08:56.180 --> 08:58.650
Access over efficiency.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.670
Trunk release.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.150
So Patel couldn't break free.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.359
The kidnapper drove Patel out of here

09:09.360 --> 09:10.870
in the trunk of his own car.

09:11.430 --> 09:13.049
E-ZPass transaction history

09:13.050 --> 09:16.009
tracks all pay roads and bridges
the car took along the way.

09:16.010 --> 09:17.659
- Final destination?
- I don't know.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.199
We lost him under a bridge.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.340
He must have switched vehicles.

09:20.350 --> 09:21.909
Well, what about toll cameras?

09:21.910 --> 09:23.350
Can you get a visual of the driver?

09:23.450 --> 09:25.119
Impossible to identify.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.270
He took basic precautions.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.760
He was wearing sunglasses, hat pulled low.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.850
There's a camera right above the exit

09:36.860 --> 09:39.339
to the parking garage, and there's
an ATM right across the way,

09:39.340 --> 09:41.299
so maybe one of those got a tighter shot.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.980
Just need a lobe, man.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.369
- A lobe?
- I mean an earlobe, you know?

09:45.370 --> 09:48.139
Faces change. Weight fluctuates over time.

09:48.140 --> 09:50.409
Even fingerprints become
unreliable with age.

09:50.410 --> 09:52.799
But the outer ear is one
of the most accurate ways

09:52.800 --> 09:54.229
of identifying somebody.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.029
You know that your ear is
fully formed at birth?

09:56.030 --> 09:57.799
I mean, sure, the lobe, it descends.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.329
It grows with time.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.129
But the overall shape remains the same.

10:01.130 --> 10:02.889
Okay, is there a database?

10:02.890 --> 10:05.350
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working on it.
Working on it.

10:06.410 --> 10:07.720
Gotcha.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.619
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

10:10.620 --> 10:12.170
Gonna talk to Benedict.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.980
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

10:22.190 --> 10:23.080
Can I help you, sir?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.670
Yes, I'm here to see Lester Benedict.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.650
- Name?
- Bryan Mills.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.979
- Mills, you said?
- Yeah.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.719
I don't see you here on the schedule.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.280
Yeah, tell him it's regarding
his missing accountant.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.250
Come with us, sir.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.770
Lester Benedict. Bryan Mills.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.010
Pleased to meet you, sir.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.340
What do you want?

10:43.650 --> 10:46.329
My firm has been hired by Valerie Banner

10:46.330 --> 10:48.829
to assist in the rescue and
recovery of Samuel Patel.

10:48.830 --> 10:50.569
I was hoping to gain access to his office,

10:50.570 --> 10:52.549
any security feeds around the premises,

10:52.550 --> 10:56.069
and of course, his email,
both work and personal.

10:56.070 --> 10:58.130
I asked for discretion.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.130
Get Valerie on the phone.

11:07.850 --> 11:08.959
Define bad news.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.449
We've been pulled off the case.

11:10.450 --> 11:12.849
Benedict Global decided
to handle this in-house.

11:12.850 --> 11:14.709
- What happened?
- Not sure.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.960
Seems like your people
poking around spooked them.

11:17.220 --> 11:18.709
Isn't that what we're supposed to do?

11:18.710 --> 11:20.170
Don't know, don't care.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.410
Our fee was paid in full. Easy money.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.300
I'll transfer over the funds soon.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.550
You can call off your dogs, Christina.

11:32.050 --> 11:34.110
That's a bit quaint for a bad guy lair.

11:34.410 --> 11:35.889
Kilroy, are you sure this is the place?

11:35.890 --> 11:37.279
I matched the driver of Patel's car

11:37.280 --> 11:38.499
with a mug shot from the system.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.700
Norman Wilkerson.

11:39.710 --> 11:41.419
He worked at a plant

11:41.420 --> 11:42.130
that was shut down by Benedict Global.

11:42.131 --> 11:43.540
There's our motive.

12:07.370 --> 12:08.150
Hey, Hart.

12:08.151 --> 12:11.149
Benedict Global has decided
to handle the case in-house.

12:11.150 --> 12:13.499
We are officially off the Patel case.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.689
It is a little late for that.

12:15.690 --> 12:18.510
We're in the kidnapper's place right now.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.459
His name is Norman Wilkerson.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.079
I told them we'd shut down the case.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.979
Why would Benedict suddenly
decide to handle this in-house?

12:25.980 --> 12:28.749
Probably didn't want a third
party turning over rocks.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.669
Scared of what we might
find hiding underneath.

12:30.670 --> 12:31.790
Get over there.

12:33.780 --> 12:34.780
Driveway.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.290
Get in the trunk.

12:39.030 --> 12:40.110
Drop the gun!

12:42.630 --> 12:43.420
You're not a cop.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.580
And you're not a killer.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.220
You don't know anything about me.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.450
Well, I think I do.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.110
I know you're holding a revolver.

12:52.180 --> 12:54.570
Only holds six rounds,
and you can't reload it.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.510
Looks old.

12:57.670 --> 12:58.850
Your father's gun?

13:00.090 --> 13:01.090
Yeah.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.610
Been tucked in the closet for years.

13:04.540 --> 13:05.610
What's your name?

13:06.880 --> 13:09.250
- Norman.
- My name's Bryan.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.690
You have an important
choice to make, Norman.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.830
I'm prepared to pull the trigger.

13:17.870 --> 13:18.870
Are you?

13:24.360 --> 13:27.640
Now, I want to hear how he did it.

13:29.290 --> 13:32.980
Benedict convinces the
employees to take pay cuts.

13:34.070 --> 13:36.010
They'll get repaid once they...

13:36.390 --> 13:38.550
They balance the company books.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.580
He swears it's the only way
to save the company, and...

13:44.120 --> 13:46.280
Benedict preys on their loyalty.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.429
The employees have worked there for years.

13:48.430 --> 13:51.139
They're willing to sacrifice
anything to save it.

13:51.140 --> 13:54.689
But once the plant is primed
to pull itself out of the red,

13:54.690 --> 13:57.160
and it's time to repay the employees...

14:00.150 --> 14:02.880
Benedict files for bankruptcy.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.239
Patel describes all the loopholes they use

14:06.240 --> 14:08.769
to funnel our pensions
into offshore accounts.

14:08.770 --> 14:10.259
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.110
- Norman...
- He's just gonna do it again.

14:12.840 --> 14:13.989
What do you mean, again?

14:13.990 --> 14:16.949
This is the fifth company
he's raided in as many years.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.939
I mean, think about how
many towns he's ruined.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.889
Imagine the families he's broken up.

14:20.890 --> 14:23.530
Meanwhile, they pay him to
speak at business schools

14:23.540 --> 14:25.020
and corporate retreats.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.380
So what is your plan?

14:29.340 --> 14:31.599
I'm gonna use this confession
to blackmail Benedict

14:31.600 --> 14:34.439
for $245,888.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.039
That's a very specific amount.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.610
Exactly what he stole.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.250
I want what was mine.

14:41.220 --> 14:42.760
I demand justice.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.330
I'm just one man.

14:52.950 --> 14:55.170
All my credit cards are maxed out.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.680
My relatives have cut me off.

15:00.450 --> 15:02.500
My wife had to pawn her wedding ring.

15:03.830 --> 15:05.540
Now they're trying to take my house.

15:07.890 --> 15:09.180
This is my last shot.

15:10.330 --> 15:12.479
You know, a forced confession
won't hold up in court.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.700
Imagine the public relations nightmare.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.859
Benedict will pay to keep it quiet.

15:16.860 --> 15:18.300
If Benedict broke the law...

15:18.310 --> 15:19.319
Laws? No, no.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.470
Laws don't apply to men like Benedict.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.309
You know if you go through with this,

15:23.310 --> 15:24.930
you will end up in jail.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.100
Or dead.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.929
Bad things happen to good people,

15:28.930 --> 15:31.020
and no one does anything about it.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.180
No, I'm not ready to just
roll over and die just yet.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.270
No way.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
No.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.870
Then we need to be smarter.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.300
We?

15:52.110 --> 15:53.399
What are you talking about?

15:53.400 --> 15:55.279
Santana's driving Patel home.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.150
Where's Norman?

15:56.151 --> 15:58.669
Stashed him at a hotel until
this is all said and done.

15:58.670 --> 15:59.809
Until what's done?

15:59.810 --> 16:01.109
Until I get the money back.

16:01.110 --> 16:02.739
Bryan, we are not crusaders.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.400
The mission was to save a life.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.089
Look, I have dealt with
men like Benedict before.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.730
They do not respond well to threats.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.629
If you want to force his
hand, then you leverage

16:11.630 --> 16:13.700
what he cares about the most.

16:14.370 --> 16:15.370
Money.

16:16.550 --> 16:17.390
To do that effectively,

16:17.391 --> 16:19.489
we need to arrange a face-to-face.

16:19.490 --> 16:20.879
Well, that's easier said than done.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.350
What kind of car does he drive?

16:40.760 --> 16:41.760
What the hell?

17:07.050 --> 17:08.299
You've done this before.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.009
Even a novice can highjack a car

17:10.010 --> 17:11.709
through the infotainment system.

17:11.710 --> 17:12.868
You can target the steering?

17:12.869 --> 17:15.419
And guidance, stability controls,

17:15.420 --> 17:18.690
cruise control, GPS, Bluetooth,

17:18.700 --> 17:21.699
automated systems for the
driver's convenience.

17:21.700 --> 17:22.800
And mine.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.180
Hello, Lester.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.470
Nice car.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.520
Buy or lease?

17:44.630 --> 17:45.710
Who are you?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.359
Name's unimportant, Lester.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.529
All that really matters is
that I represent a client

17:50.530 --> 17:52.859
who's owed a substantial sum of money,

17:52.860 --> 17:54.860
and I am here to collect.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.179
There's a flash drive in here.

17:58.180 --> 18:01.059
It contains the confession
of one of your employees

18:01.060 --> 18:02.749
who describes, in detail,

18:02.750 --> 18:05.120
all of your illegal business practices...

18:05.130 --> 18:08.949
Specifically how you
steal employee pensions

18:08.950 --> 18:10.639
from the companies you raid.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.890
I don't appreciate these wild accusations.

18:14.350 --> 18:17.929
This alleged confession
is slanderous at best

18:17.930 --> 18:20.100
and sure as hell won't be admissible.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.000
Of course not, Lester.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.869
Still, it would be a shame if
the video ended up on YouTube.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.679
I haven't done anything illegal.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.119
You consider funneling money

18:29.120 --> 18:31.950
into secret offshore accounts legal?

18:33.260 --> 18:35.729
Forget about your reputation, Lester.

18:35.730 --> 18:38.859
Imagine how the board will react.

18:38.860 --> 18:39.959
You think you're the first person

18:39.960 --> 18:41.319
who's tried to blackmail me?

18:41.320 --> 18:44.710
My client will walk away
once the debt is repaid.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.739
Step away from my car.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.789
This is pocket change to you.

18:48.790 --> 18:52.450
If I pay, more accusations will follow.

18:52.620 --> 18:54.009
It'll never end.

18:54.010 --> 18:57.230
Consider it the price
of doing bad business.

18:59.830 --> 19:02.940
- How much?
- 250 grand.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.660
Whatever makes this all go away.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.740
The drive is yours.

19:17.270 --> 19:18.080
Hey, we got to make sure

19:18.081 --> 19:19.659
that we're protecting Norman's identity,

19:19.660 --> 19:22.580
so you are taking every precaution, right?

19:23.360 --> 19:26.539
All you do is deposit the
cash into a PayPal account,

19:26.540 --> 19:28.229
use it to purchase Bitcoin,

19:28.230 --> 19:29.829
open a bunch of dummy accounts,

19:29.830 --> 19:32.430
buy some gift cards and
make some online purchases,

19:32.500 --> 19:35.529
and the returned items get
converted back into cash.

19:35.530 --> 19:38.389
Something tells me you've got
money hidden all over the net.

19:38.390 --> 19:41.040
The internet's my digital mattress.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.129
In more ways than one, sadly.

19:43.130 --> 19:44.549
That's really gross.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.300
- Santana.
- Thank you.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.800
You don't have to sell the
house anymore, Norman.

19:55.770 --> 19:58.750
My wife... she loved this house.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.240
Should've seen it when we first moved in.

20:01.890 --> 20:03.380
Place was falling apart.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.940
We rebuilt it from the ground up.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.360
Every weekend was a new project.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.810
When Kate got pregnant,

20:11.330 --> 20:13.960
she spent months getting
that nursery ready.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.710
It had to be perfect.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.360
Nesting.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.359
Rearranging the closets drove me nuts.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.120
Survival instinct.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.220
Nature's way of keeping us close to home.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.140
I'd give anything to have Kate here...

20:32.560 --> 20:34.370
rearranging those closets.

20:35.270 --> 20:37.490
- You should tell her that.
- I did.

20:38.150 --> 20:40.420
Probably too late now to make a difference.

20:45.300 --> 20:49.500
I'm the reason she left. Not Benedict.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.530
After the plant closed, I just...

20:54.780 --> 20:57.570
started into a downward spiral.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.640
Why'd you help me, Bryan?

21:13.100 --> 21:14.100
My uncle...

21:15.180 --> 21:18.060
He... he worked for a
factory when I was young.

21:18.950 --> 21:22.740
Well, most of the whole town
was employed by that factory

21:22.750 --> 21:23.750
in one way or another.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.830
And then the corporate raiders
showed up and shut it down.

21:31.820 --> 21:34.440
And when the factory goes
down in a factory town,

21:35.720 --> 21:36.720
you know,

21:38.040 --> 21:39.620
everything crumbles around it.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Your uncle...

21:43.040 --> 21:44.040
He ever recover?

21:45.980 --> 21:47.020
I found him dead.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.130
Hanging from the rafters.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.820
I had to cut him down
before my aunt got home.

22:03.640 --> 22:04.640
My aunt, she...

22:05.610 --> 22:06.929
She cursed the businessmen,

22:06.930 --> 22:08.330
but I blamed myself

22:09.330 --> 22:10.490
for not doing more.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.460
I could've done more.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.210
Should've...

22:21.640 --> 22:23.300
pushed him to keep fighting.

22:28.130 --> 22:29.820
$200,000 there.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.790
That is enough to start over.

22:33.170 --> 22:34.949
Seeing that fear in Benedict's eyes

22:34.950 --> 22:36.310
was worth millions.

22:37.660 --> 22:38.770
What did you just say?

22:44.240 --> 22:45.780
Tell me what happened, Norman.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.330
I went to see Benedict.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.580
Waited for him at the top
of the parking ramp.

22:49.760 --> 22:50.980
Thought I was homeless.

22:51.950 --> 22:53.550
Tried to hand me a few bucks.

22:53.660 --> 22:56.109
You were instructed to lay low.

22:56.110 --> 22:57.180
It didn't feel right.

22:57.350 --> 22:58.590
What about all the others, hmm?

22:59.270 --> 23:00.990
I let Benedict know this isn't over.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.360
And how did you think he would respond?

23:08.510 --> 23:10.060
Men are here to kill you, Norman.

23:10.070 --> 23:11.070
What?

23:12.940 --> 23:14.180
I need you to listen to me.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.910
- Where is your gun?
- In my room.

23:16.050 --> 23:17.050
Go get it.

23:17.140 --> 23:18.980
You shoot anyone who makes
it up those stairs.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.100
What are you gonna do?

24:03.290 --> 24:04.290
Norman.

24:39.470 --> 24:41.490
Cops will call it a home invasion gone bad.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.879
Houses up for sale are common targets.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.140
The sign out front is
practically an invitation

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
to burglars.

24:48.210 --> 24:50.209
And there's a lockbox right by the door

24:50.210 --> 24:51.210
with a key inside.

24:55.210 --> 24:56.210
Mills, you okay?

24:56.250 --> 24:57.530
You got kind of a lot of blood.

24:59.580 --> 25:00.580
It's not mine.

25:03.890 --> 25:05.439
Why would Benedict risk everything

25:05.440 --> 25:06.730
just to prove a point?

25:07.150 --> 25:08.700
Because Norman confronted him.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.610
Benedict knew it wasn't over.

25:14.330 --> 25:15.990
He knew the problem would disappear.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.890
Bad things happen to good people.

25:21.470 --> 25:24.260
And nobody does anything about it.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.220
Norman wanted justice.

25:41.030 --> 25:43.500
What you're about to do is
something very different.

25:43.550 --> 25:44.950
Benedict deserves what's coming.

25:45.060 --> 25:46.809
You remember your last revenge mission?

25:46.810 --> 25:48.829
Yep, and he deserved a bullet too.

25:48.830 --> 25:50.249
Yeah, you spent six months in prison,

25:50.250 --> 25:50.890
you were almost killed,

25:50.891 --> 25:52.770
and I had to disband the entire team.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.609
How is killing Benedict not justified?

25:55.610 --> 25:58.550
Justice is about creating order.

25:59.490 --> 26:01.279
It's not about satiating anger.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.639
It's about finding a balance.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.760
The punishment must be proportionate.

26:09.570 --> 26:10.570
Okay.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.690
So, you tell me how he should be punished.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.170
Let's take a page out of Norman's playbook.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.909
Patel confessed once.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.580
Maybe he can be persuaded
to testify on record.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.480
Made it look like a suicide.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.660
I bet it's the same guy that killed Norman.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.799
Benedict's cleaning up his
mess, one dead body at a time.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.800
Can't prove it.

27:28.570 --> 27:30.530
You know what, we tried
playing this by the book.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.220
Now it's time to bring Benedict in.

27:33.700 --> 27:34.900
Can you locate his vehicle?

27:37.150 --> 27:38.999
GPS in Benedict's car places him

27:39.000 --> 27:40.929
in a small private airport in Virginia.

27:40.930 --> 27:41.939
So, he's trying to leave town?

27:41.940 --> 27:43.349
- How far from here?
- 30 minutes.

27:43.350 --> 27:44.819
Ten if you let me screw
with the traffic lights.

27:44.820 --> 27:46.409
But I mean, you'll never
make it either way.

27:46.410 --> 27:47.410
Where's he headed?

27:48.810 --> 27:50.349
Belize. He's got a place there.

27:50.350 --> 27:51.606
He goes there every couple of months.

27:51.630 --> 27:52.600
Even if we had anything,

27:52.601 --> 27:54.430
Belize will never extradite Benedict.

27:54.690 --> 27:55.690
I'll go get him.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.440
What does that mean?

27:57.940 --> 27:58.940
Bring him back.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.910
We can have another Mexico, Bryan.

28:20.570 --> 28:22.570
I've spent a lot of time
in Belize over the years.

28:22.610 --> 28:23.650
You ever been here before?

28:23.790 --> 28:25.140
Lot of places I've never been.

28:25.890 --> 28:29.039
Well, Belize isn't just
a vacation destination.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.980
It's like a safe haven for
white-collar criminals.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.400
Benedict should feel right at home.

28:33.750 --> 28:35.810
Yep, the government looks the other way

28:35.820 --> 28:36.860
as long as they get a cut.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.090
You get details on his compound?

28:39.480 --> 28:40.660
Oh, you mean fortress?

28:41.290 --> 28:42.290
Security.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.560
Top of the line.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.000
Kilroy will help with that.

28:45.610 --> 28:47.820
Yeah, Benedict has protection.

28:48.590 --> 28:49.590
Private military?

28:49.900 --> 28:51.190
Gang suppression unit.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.229
Paid for by the government,
but they function

28:53.230 --> 28:55.350
more like a hit squad for hire.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.399
And Benedict has the money
to keep them working

28:57.400 --> 28:58.400
around the clock.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.659
Mills, I just want to make
sure you're hearing me.

29:00.660 --> 29:02.480
The guy has a small army guarding him.

29:03.330 --> 29:04.570
The contact come through yet?

29:07.420 --> 29:08.540
You sure she got everything?

29:09.130 --> 29:10.620
La Tumba never disappoints.

29:11.650 --> 29:12.650
Tumba?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.410
That's Spanish for "Grave."

29:15.010 --> 29:16.000
She got the name because that's where

29:16.001 --> 29:17.530
she usually hides the goods.

29:19.610 --> 29:20.610
You sure this is the one?

29:42.820 --> 29:43.950
Kopi Luwak beans.

29:44.390 --> 29:45.680
$200 for a pound.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.360
Why's it so expensive?

29:47.980 --> 29:50.549
Civets. The beans ferment inside the animal

29:50.550 --> 29:52.070
and then get collected from the, uh...

29:52.580 --> 29:53.580
droppings.

29:54.740 --> 29:55.740
You want some?

29:56.060 --> 29:57.210
See, you have a problem with this.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.979
Meanwhile, the FDA allows one maggot

29:58.980 --> 30:01.199
for every 250 milliliters of fruit juice.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.609
Don't even get me started on cereal.

30:02.610 --> 30:03.610
Any word from Mills?

30:05.090 --> 30:06.090
Nothing.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.110
Think we both know how this story ends.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.110
Listen, guys like Benedict,

30:10.350 --> 30:11.830
they destroy hundreds of lives for what?

30:11.840 --> 30:13.370
To pad their pockets.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.309
Death is too light a sentence for that guy.

30:16.310 --> 30:17.640
He deserves something way worse.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.250
Favor for a favor.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.100
Anything.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.949
I need some personal information

30:24.950 --> 30:26.810
about Lester Benedict.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.600
How did he secure your services?

30:29.920 --> 30:31.089
Money. What else?

30:31.090 --> 30:32.659
Yes, but how did he pay you?

30:32.660 --> 30:34.330
Was it a check? Direct deposit?

30:34.460 --> 30:35.649
Wire transfer.

30:35.650 --> 30:38.070
I need all the details on that transaction.

30:38.390 --> 30:40.540
Client's information is privileged.

30:41.350 --> 30:42.980
You came to me for a reason.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.910
Now I'm coming to you.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.219
Benedict has enough money to destroy anyone

30:47.220 --> 30:48.220
who gets in his way.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.550
There's a guy outside the gate

31:12.560 --> 31:14.050
demanding to speak with you.

31:14.410 --> 31:15.360
Send him away.

31:15.410 --> 31:17.330
The same guy who showed up at your office.

31:37.070 --> 31:38.070
Who are you?

31:40.040 --> 31:41.040
Hello, Lester.

31:42.810 --> 31:44.130
I've come a long way to find you.

31:44.690 --> 31:46.670
You should consider this your last warning.

31:47.450 --> 31:48.450
Surrender now,

31:49.960 --> 31:51.380
and I'll bring you to justice.

31:56.820 --> 31:57.820
Good luck.

32:00.510 --> 32:02.420
Kilroy, cut the feeds.

32:05.060 --> 32:06.060
Kill him.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.720
- What the hell is going on?
- Don't worry, sir.

32:44.870 --> 32:45.870
We got this.

32:46.890 --> 32:47.890
This way, sir.

33:56.380 --> 33:57.380
Positions.

33:58.660 --> 33:59.660
Light him up.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.420
Santana, a little help?

34:27.710 --> 34:29.040
This is for Norman.

34:52.230 --> 34:54.489
And this is for Patel.

35:36.890 --> 35:37.890
Lester!

35:38.250 --> 35:39.790
I'm not leaving without you!

35:45.370 --> 35:46.360
Don't waste the ammo, Mills.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.110
The room is equipped

35:47.120 --> 35:49.670
with bullet-resistant walls
and fiberglass panels.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.130
There's a security panel.

35:52.300 --> 35:53.859
I can't access any of the tech.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.180
If you want to get in, you need
Benedict to open the door.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.370
All right, hold on a second.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.829
I found a layout to the panic room.

35:58.830 --> 36:00.650
There's a duct behind the left wall.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.410
So, you tell me.

36:47.380 --> 36:48.600
How should you be punished?

36:49.420 --> 36:51.190
What's the appropriate penalty

36:51.490 --> 36:53.230
for the pain you've caused?

36:54.660 --> 36:55.780
Hammurabi's code.

36:56.310 --> 36:57.320
An eye for an eye.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.430
Tooth for a tooth.

37:07.110 --> 37:08.110
How much?

37:08.560 --> 37:10.090
How much... how much do you want?

37:11.170 --> 37:12.450
I can pay you whatever you want.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.130
Let me tell you a little story.

37:20.270 --> 37:21.390
About a man.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.080
A good man.

37:23.590 --> 37:25.250
Married his college sweetheart.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.050
Then they started a life together.

37:28.870 --> 37:29.990
Sure, they were broke.

37:30.470 --> 37:31.470
Didn't matter, though.

37:31.800 --> 37:32.900
Because they knew

37:33.200 --> 37:35.510
all that hard work would pay off.

37:37.060 --> 37:38.750
So, after years of saving,

37:38.760 --> 37:40.310
watching every penny,

37:41.040 --> 37:42.230
they finally had enough

37:43.970 --> 37:45.060
to buy a house.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.160
American dream.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.750
Small house. Nothing special.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.580
But they liked it.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.630
They loved it.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.310
Because it was theirs.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.520
They earned it.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.389
And maybe someday, if he kept his head down

38:03.390 --> 38:04.960
and played by the rules,

38:05.550 --> 38:06.670
he could retire,

38:07.280 --> 38:09.080
enjoy the time he had left with her.

38:09.850 --> 38:11.220
I'm not the one who killed him.

38:17.330 --> 38:20.250
His name was Norman.

38:21.350 --> 38:23.000
You see, you made the rules.

38:23.590 --> 38:24.760
And then you broke them.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.080
Because you could.

38:28.170 --> 38:29.170
Who are you?

38:29.620 --> 38:30.940
What do you want from me?

38:31.080 --> 38:32.200
Now, that's a good question.

38:33.590 --> 38:35.340
Because when I first arrived down here,

38:36.800 --> 38:38.270
I wasn't sure what to do.

38:39.410 --> 38:42.390
See, I thought about
bringing you to justice.

38:43.090 --> 38:46.040
But snakes like you always
manage to slither away.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.150
So, then I thought about killing you.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.640
Slowly.

38:53.510 --> 38:54.510
Painfully.

38:56.800 --> 38:57.800
But for you?

38:59.210 --> 39:00.720
Death would be too easy.

39:02.300 --> 39:05.300
See, I needed to find a punishment...

39:07.100 --> 39:08.140
as proportionate.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.920
I realized there's a
better way of doing this.

39:14.170 --> 39:15.910
So, I liquidated your accounts.

39:16.620 --> 39:17.810
I don't understand.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.489
You're broke, Benedict. Flat broke.

39:20.490 --> 39:22.190
What? No, that's not possible.

39:22.230 --> 39:24.159
We were able to find all of your accounts,

39:24.160 --> 39:25.160
every single one.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.570
See for yourself.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Go on.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.360
They've all been drained.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.350
Even the secret ones.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.130
That money you thought
no one could ever find.

39:37.190 --> 39:39.119
The Cayman account. Luxembourg.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.490
That safety deposit box in Bahrain.

39:41.510 --> 39:44.079
Every dollar, gone.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.080
No.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.849
This isn't real. This can't be real.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.710
The same way you stole the
pensions from all those people.

39:53.040 --> 39:56.190
Even when you had more money
than you could ever spend.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.280
Now you know how they feel.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.549
Where is it? What did you do?

40:01.550 --> 40:04.610
Now, my team is redistributing the funds,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.389
giving it back to all the
people you stole from.

40:07.390 --> 40:08.390
It's not everything.

40:08.720 --> 40:09.720
But it's a start.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.200
No. Ha.

40:11.330 --> 40:13.110
No, no, that's not possible.

40:13.390 --> 40:16.280
Money problems should be the least
of your concerns right now.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.070
That's the sound of more GSU soldiers.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.290
Don't get too excited.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.990
Because they're not here to save you.

40:27.890 --> 40:29.099
My people have already informed them

40:29.100 --> 40:31.160
of your financial troubles
and taken back anything

40:31.170 --> 40:32.340
you might have paid them.

40:32.570 --> 40:35.470
You see, that's the problem
with paid mercenaries.

40:35.580 --> 40:37.400
You have to be able to pay them.

40:38.110 --> 40:39.549
Otherwise, they become your enemy

40:39.550 --> 40:41.949
and come to extract their
fee some other way.

40:41.950 --> 40:43.769
No, no. You can't do that.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.950
First, they're gonna tear this place apart,

40:46.060 --> 40:47.999
steal everything you own...
Which won't be enough,

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
because it never is.

40:49.130 --> 40:50.690
So, then they'll come to you for money,

40:51.190 --> 40:53.150
money that you no longer have.

40:55.240 --> 40:56.470
What they do after that...

40:58.920 --> 41:00.149
Well, that's up to them.

41:00.150 --> 41:01.859
No, no, please, you can't
leave me like this.

41:01.860 --> 41:02.860
Please.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.120
You have a decision to make.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.469
Either spend the rest of your life

41:07.470 --> 41:09.250
in a deep, dark hole somewhere,

41:10.750 --> 41:11.750
or...

41:19.150 --> 41:20.720
Norman decided to fight.

41:24.010 --> 41:25.010
What will you do?

41:26.380 --> 41:28.570
Now you've had everything taken from you.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.000
No, wait. Wait, please!

41:31.010 --> 41:32.010
Good luck.
