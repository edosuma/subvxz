00:36.200 --> 00:37.200
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:37.266 --> 00:41.766
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:41.833 --> 00:42.566
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:42.633 --> 00:42.733
US.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.433
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:43.500 --> 00:43.700
THE WEEK.

00:43.766 --> 00:44.200
AND IT'S BEEN BUSY ONE.

00:44.266 --> 00:44.766
A FORMER FACEBOOK EMPLOYEE

00:44.833 --> 00:45.266
CONFIRMED WHAT EVERYONE

00:45.333 --> 00:46.666
BASICALLY KNEW, FACEBOOK'S

00:46.733 --> 00:47.400
TERRIBLE AND IT'S VERY MUCH BY

00:47.466 --> 00:49.066
DESIGN.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.766
OTIS THE BEAR, THE THREE-TIME

00:50.833 --> 00:52.300
WINNER OF FAT BEAR WEEK BECAME

00:52.366 --> 00:53.766
THE FOUR-TIME WINNER, BECAUSE

00:53.833 --> 00:54.833
MERITOCRACY IS A LIE AND OUR

00:54.900 --> 00:56.833
SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

00:56.900 --> 00:57.700
AND IN IDAHO, THERE WAS THIS

00:57.766 --> 00:59.366
DRAMATIC POWER GRAB.

00:59.433 --> 01:00.866
>> THERE IS A BLISTERING BATTLE

01:00.933 --> 01:02.466
HAPPENING NOW BETWEEN THE TWO

01:02.533 --> 01:04.833
TOP ELECTED OFFICIALS IN IDAHO.

01:04.900 --> 01:07.333
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JANICE

01:07.400 --> 01:08.266
McGEACHIN SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE

01:08.333 --> 01:09.666
ORDER BANNING VACCINE MANDATES

01:09.733 --> 01:10.800
IN SCHOOLS AND COVID TESTING IN

01:10.866 --> 01:13.633
CERTAIN CAPACITIES.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.500
THE PROBLEM IS THE GOVERNOR,

01:14.566 --> 01:16.633
BRAD LITTLE, WAS OUT OF THE

01:16.700 --> 01:17.433
STATE WHEN SHE DID IT, AND

01:17.500 --> 01:18.400
QUICKLY PROMISED TO UNDO THE

01:18.466 --> 01:21.733
ORDER.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.733
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE!

01:22.800 --> 01:23.366
WHILE THE IDAHO GOVERNOR WAS OUT

01:23.433 --> 01:24.266
OF STATE, HIS LIEUTENANT

01:24.333 --> 01:25.200
GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE

01:25.266 --> 01:26.366
ORDER TRYING TO BAN SCHOOLS FROM

01:26.433 --> 01:27.633
REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO BE

01:27.700 --> 01:29.200
VACCINATED.

01:29.266 --> 01:30.433
AND NOT JUST THAT -- SHE ALSO

01:30.500 --> 01:32.400
SENT THE STATE NATIONAL GUARD A

01:32.466 --> 01:34.133
QUERY ABOUT ACTIVATING TROOPS

01:34.200 --> 01:34.633
AND SENDING THEM TO THE

01:34.700 --> 01:36.200
U.S.-MEXICO BORDER.

01:36.266 --> 01:37.033
WHICH IS A PRETTY BOLD MOVE FROM

01:37.100 --> 01:40.300
A SECOND IN COMMAND.

01:40.366 --> 01:41.833
IT'S BASICALLY A PLANE'S PILOT

01:41.900 --> 01:42.566
GOING TO THE BATHROOM AND THE

01:42.633 --> 01:44.266
CO-PILOT ANNOUNCING, "CHANGE OF

01:44.333 --> 01:46.000
PLANS, WE'RE HEADED TO RENO.

01:46.066 --> 01:47.200
MY BUDDY SAID HE'D SET ME UP

01:47.266 --> 01:48.833
WITH HIS COUSIN IF I WAS EVER

01:48.900 --> 01:53.800
THERE, AND I SAW A PICTURE OF

01:53.866 --> 01:54.333
HER AND SHE'S AN ABSOLUTE

01:54.400 --> 01:54.600
SMOKESHOW.

01:54.666 --> 01:55.033
SO STRAP IN, FOLKS.

01:55.100 --> 01:55.866
IT'S GONNA BE BUMPY ON PURPOSE."

01:55.933 --> 01:56.700
AND THE THING IS, IN IDAHO, THE

01:56.766 --> 01:57.266
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DOES

01:57.333 --> 01:58.400
TECHNICALLY BECOME ACTING

01:58.466 --> 02:00.200
GOVERNOR WHENEVER THE ACTUAL

02:00.266 --> 02:02.300
GOVERNOR LEAVES THE STATE THANKS

02:02.366 --> 02:03.033
TO A STATE CONSTITUTION THAT WAS

02:03.100 --> 02:05.700
DEFINITELY WRITTEN LONG BEFORE

02:05.766 --> 02:07.366
CELL PHONES EXISTED, BUT KNOWING

02:07.433 --> 02:08.566
THAT, IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE

02:08.633 --> 02:09.800
THAT BRAD LITTLE CHOSE TO LEAVE

02:09.866 --> 02:10.766
THE STATE AT ALL, ESPECIALLY

02:10.833 --> 02:13.000
BECAUSE McGEACHIN HAD ACTUALLY

02:13.066 --> 02:14.166
TRIED A SIMILAR STUNT BACK IN

02:14.233 --> 02:15.533
MAY WHEN HE LEFT FOR A

02:15.600 --> 02:16.833
CONFERENCE IN TENNESSEE AND SHE

02:16.900 --> 02:18.100
ISSUED AN ORDER BANNING MASK

02:18.166 --> 02:20.633
MANDATES.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.066
SO IT FEELS BORDERLINE RECKLESS

02:22.133 --> 02:28.466
FOR HIM TO STEP OUTSIDE THE

02:28.533 --> 02:29.300
STATE RIGHT NOW

02:29.366 --> 02:29.933
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S EVER

02:30.000 --> 02:30.400
DISGUISED WHO SHE IS.

02:30.466 --> 02:31.033
JUST LOOK AT THIS APPEARANCE SHE

02:31.100 --> 02:31.566
MADE LAST YEAR IN A VIDEO

02:31.633 --> 02:33.333
CRITICIZING COVID RESTRICTIONS.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.200
>> WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALL OF US

02:34.266 --> 02:36.733
ARE, BY NATURE, FREE AND EQUAL,

02:36.800 --> 02:38.466
AND HAVE CERTAIN INALIENABLE

02:38.533 --> 02:41.100
RIGHTS, AMONG WHICH ARE ENJOYING

02:41.166 --> 02:43.166
AND DEFENDING LIFE AND LIBERTY,

02:43.233 --> 02:45.333
ACQUIRING, POSSESSING, AND

02:45.400 --> 02:48.833
PROTECTING PROPERTY, AND

02:48.900 --> 02:49.766
PURSUING HAPPINESS, AND SECURING

02:49.833 --> 02:52.400
SAFETY.

02:52.466 --> 02:53.633
>> John: WOW.

02:53.700 --> 02:57.066
THAT IS A RICH TEXT.

02:57.133 --> 02:57.600
ALTHOUGH, I WILL SAY, THAT

02:57.666 --> 02:58.233
REPRESENTS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

02:58.300 --> 02:58.833
BETTER THAN ANYTHING I'VE EVER

02:58.900 --> 03:00.133
SEEN.

03:00.200 --> 03:00.866
AN ELEPHANT?

03:00.933 --> 03:02.866
DOESN'T QUITE DO IT.

03:02.933 --> 03:03.466
A SWIRLY SNAKE SAYING DON'T

03:03.533 --> 03:04.033
TREAD ON ME?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.500
NO.

03:05.566 --> 03:06.566
BUT A GUN BIBLE AND A MISQUOTED

03:06.633 --> 03:08.600
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.166
THAT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I

03:10.233 --> 03:14.266
KNOW.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.233
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS GOING

03:15.300 --> 03:15.866
TO BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM, HAVING

03:15.933 --> 03:19.500
TO KEEP A CONSTANT EYE ON THE

03:19.566 --> 03:20.166
ULTRA-RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY, SO

03:20.233 --> 03:20.733
THEY DON'T SUDDENLY GRAB THE

03:20.800 --> 03:21.400
WHEEL AND STEER US STRAIGHT INTO

03:21.466 --> 03:22.900
HELL.

03:22.966 --> 03:24.333
AND SPEAKING OF HELL, THAT

03:24.400 --> 03:26.233
BRINGS US TO OUR SECOND STORY,

03:26.300 --> 03:26.966
OAN, THE ONE AMERICA NEWS

03:27.033 --> 03:28.666
NETWORK.

03:28.733 --> 03:29.266
YOU MAY REMEMBER WE COVERED IT

03:29.333 --> 03:29.966
LAST YEAR.

03:30.033 --> 03:31.566
IT'S A FAR RIGHT CHANNEL THAT

03:31.633 --> 03:33.066
PEDDLES COVID MISINFORMATION AND

03:33.133 --> 03:34.133
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

03:34.200 --> 03:34.966
WELL, THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED SOME

03:35.033 --> 03:37.666
PRETTY UNSETTLING NEWS.

03:37.733 --> 03:39.000
>> A NEW REUTERS INVESTIGATION

03:39.066 --> 03:40.066
BASED ON A REVIEW OF COURT

03:40.133 --> 03:42.233
RECORDS REVEALS THAT OANN HAS

03:42.300 --> 03:43.500
FLOURISHED THANKS TO FINANCIAL

03:43.566 --> 03:45.733
SUPPORT FROM A SURPRISING

03:45.800 --> 03:48.666
MAINSTREAM SOURCE, AT&T.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.666
>> John: YUP!

03:50.733 --> 03:51.733
TURNS OUT AT&T HAS BEEN UP TO

03:51.800 --> 03:53.933
SOME SHIT.

03:54.033 --> 03:54.833
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING -- AT&T IS

03:54.900 --> 03:56.833
STILL, TECHNICALLY, OUR BUSINESS

03:56.900 --> 03:58.433
DADDY, MAKING OAN OUR BUSINESS

03:58.500 --> 04:00.833
STEPSIBLING, AND NOT IN A HOT

04:00.900 --> 04:03.300
WAY.

04:03.366 --> 04:04.200
REUTERS REPORTED THAT, IN

04:04.266 --> 04:05.900
DEPOSITIONS, OAN'S FOUNDER

04:05.966 --> 04:07.233
ROBERT HERRING TESTIFIED AT&T

04:07.300 --> 04:08.366
EXECUTIVES ONCE TOLD HIM THEY

04:08.433 --> 04:10.033
WANTED A CONSERVATIVE NETWORK,

04:10.100 --> 04:11.400
AND HE CLAIMS, "WHEN THEY SAID

04:11.466 --> 04:12.566
THAT, I JUMPED TO IT AND BUILT

04:12.633 --> 04:13.800
ONE."

04:13.866 --> 04:15.233
AND ONCE HE BUILT THE CHANNEL,

04:15.300 --> 04:16.300
AT&T CARRIED IT.

04:16.366 --> 04:17.500
FIRST ON THEIR U-VERSE SYSTEM,

04:17.566 --> 04:20.533
AND THEN ON DIRECT TV.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.033
AND WITH THAT HELP, OAN HAS

04:22.100 --> 04:23.566
GROWN INTO THE TOXIC NETWORK IT

04:23.633 --> 04:24.700
IS TODAY, ONE THAT'S HAPPY TO

04:24.766 --> 04:25.900
GIVE A PLATFORM TO BATSHIT

04:25.966 --> 04:27.133
ELECTION FRAUD THEORIES FROM

04:27.200 --> 04:28.766
AMERICA'S MOST OUT-OF-BREATH

04:28.833 --> 04:30.833
PILLOW FETISHIST, AND ONE THAT,

04:30.900 --> 04:31.800
A FEW MONTHS AGO, FEATURED ONE

04:31.866 --> 04:34.700
OF ITS COMMENTATORS SAYING THIS.

04:34.766 --> 04:36.233
>> DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS,

04:36.300 --> 04:37.466
THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS LEFT

04:37.533 --> 04:39.066
FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THE

04:39.133 --> 04:40.500
COUNTRY, PROVIDING A TRAIL OF

04:40.566 --> 04:43.233
EVIDENCE THAT THE 2020 ELECTION

04:43.300 --> 04:45.566
WAS NOT ONLY TAMPERED WITH, BUT

04:45.633 --> 04:47.333
WAS ACTUALLY OVERTHROWN.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.366
ANY AMERICAN INVOLVED IN THESE

04:49.433 --> 04:50.600
EFFORTS, FROM THOSE WHO RAN THE

04:50.666 --> 04:52.566
VOTING MACHINES TO THE VERY

04:52.633 --> 04:54.933
HIGHEST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, IS

04:55.000 --> 04:57.233
GUILTY OF TREASON UNDER U.S.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.100
CODE 2381, WHICH CARRIES WITH IT

04:59.166 --> 05:03.933
THE PENALTY OF DEATH.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.233
>> John: LOOK, I GET THAT WE'RE

05:05.300 --> 05:06.400
WATCHING A CALL FOR MASS

05:06.466 --> 05:07.600
EXECUTIONS FROM A GUY WITH, FOR

05:07.666 --> 05:09.433
LACK OF A BETTER TERM, "BIG

05:09.500 --> 05:11.966
THEATER KID ENERGY," BUT ARE YOU

05:12.033 --> 05:13.466
REALLY SAYING THOSE WHO RAN THE

05:13.533 --> 05:14.133
VOTING MACHINES COULD BE

05:14.200 --> 05:14.800
TRAITORS?

05:14.866 --> 05:16.800
YOU MEAN DOLORES?

05:16.866 --> 05:19.200
DOLORES FROM DOWN THE STREET?

05:19.266 --> 05:20.233
WHO VOLUNTEERED TO SPEND 12

05:20.300 --> 05:21.366
HOURS OF HER -- LET'S FACE IT --

05:21.433 --> 05:23.433
DWINDLING "NCIS"-WATCHING TIME

05:23.500 --> 05:24.700
DOLING OUT PARTICIPATION

05:24.766 --> 05:25.766
STICKERS TO VOTERS?

05:25.833 --> 05:26.966
THAT DOLORES?

05:27.033 --> 05:28.366
ALL RIGHT, DEATH TO DOLORES, I

05:28.433 --> 05:30.033
GUESS.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.366
SORRY, LO-LO, BUT DECAF PITBULL

05:33.433 --> 05:34.066
HERE HEARD A RUMOR FROM A PILLOW

05:34.133 --> 05:34.800
SALESMAN THAT YOU DESERVE THE

05:34.866 --> 05:36.966
CHAIR.

05:37.033 --> 05:39.200
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AT&T

05:39.266 --> 05:40.900
SAYS THAT NO "SENIOR" EXECUTIVE

05:40.966 --> 05:42.000
SUGGESTED TO HERRING THAT HE

05:42.066 --> 05:42.966
CREATE ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE

05:43.033 --> 05:43.966
NETWORK, WITH THE CARVE-OUT OF

05:44.033 --> 05:45.233
"SENIOR" THERE BEING PRETTY

05:45.300 --> 05:47.333
STRIKING.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.766
THEY ALSO SAY THEY'VE NEVER HAD

05:48.833 --> 05:50.333
A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN OAN'S

05:50.400 --> 05:51.933
SUCCESS AND "DO NOT FUND" THE

05:52.000 --> 05:52.500
NETWORK, NEITHER OF WHICH IS

05:52.566 --> 05:54.066
100% THE ISSUE HERE.

05:54.133 --> 05:59.033
THEY ALSO CLAIM THE ONLY REASON

05:59.100 --> 05:59.666
OAN WAS ON DIRECTV WAS THAT THE

05:59.733 --> 06:03.900
NETWORK HAD SUED THEM.

06:03.966 --> 06:04.300
AND OKAY!

06:04.366 --> 06:04.866
I GUESS THE LARGEST TELECOM

06:04.933 --> 06:05.500
COMPANY IN THE WORLD GOT ROLLED

06:05.566 --> 06:06.133
IN A LAWSUIT BY A RAGTAG BAND OF

06:06.200 --> 06:08.033
FASCISTS.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.300
IT HAPPENS!

06:10.366 --> 06:11.300
BUT THE LARGER POINT IS, OAN

06:11.366 --> 06:12.100
WOULD BE LITERALLY NOTHING

06:12.166 --> 06:13.833
WITHOUT AT&T.

06:13.900 --> 06:14.566
AN OAN ACCOUNTANT REPORTEDLY

06:14.633 --> 06:15.566
SAID, UNDER OATH, THAT AT&T

06:15.633 --> 06:18.800
PROVIDED 90% OF HERRING

06:18.866 --> 06:20.400
NETWORKS' INCOME.

06:20.466 --> 06:22.733
AS FOR OAN'S HORRENDOUS CONTENT,

06:22.800 --> 06:24.966
AT&T TOLD US DIRECTV RESPECTS

06:25.033 --> 06:27.433
THE EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE OF

06:27.500 --> 06:29.200
THE CHANNELS IT CARRIES, JUST AS

06:29.266 --> 06:31.300
AT&T IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING

06:31.366 --> 06:32.400
EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE FOR EVERY

06:32.466 --> 06:33.633
WARNER MEDIA SHOW, INCLUDING

06:33.700 --> 06:37.433
THIS ONE.

06:37.500 --> 06:37.966
AND THAT IS SUCH A RELIEF!

06:38.033 --> 06:39.700
ESPECIALLY THAT LAST PART.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.500
BECAUSE IF I MAY, I'D LIKE TO

06:41.566 --> 06:42.700
USE THAT GENEROUS EDITORIAL

06:42.766 --> 06:44.033
INDEPENDENCE TO OFFER SOME

06:44.100 --> 06:49.333
CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.566
TAKE AT&T'S RECENT CAMPAIGN.

06:50.633 --> 06:51.800
"MORE FOR YOUR THING, THAT'S OUR

06:51.866 --> 06:52.566
THING," WHICH IS, RESPECTFULLY,

06:52.633 --> 06:55.033
COMPLETE GIBBERISH.

06:55.100 --> 06:55.900
IT SOUNDS LIKE YODA PITCHING A

06:55.966 --> 06:57.866
PENIS-ENLARGEMENT DEVICE.

06:57.933 --> 06:59.000
IT'S SO NONSENSICAL I HAVE TO

06:59.066 --> 06:59.666
ASSUME SOMETHING WAS LOST IN

06:59.733 --> 07:01.166
COMMUNICATION, WHICH ACTUALLY

07:01.233 --> 07:02.200
WOULD BE A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE

07:02.266 --> 07:04.700
SLOGAN FOR THE COMPANY.

07:04.766 --> 07:06.133
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT,

07:06.200 --> 07:06.900
AT&T, DON'T WORRY, I'VE GOT

07:06.966 --> 07:08.066
MORE.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.200
HOW ABOUT "AT&T, ALL THE

07:10.266 --> 07:11.000
BUSINESS SAVVY OF QUIBI WITHOUT

07:11.066 --> 07:11.533
THE COURTESY OF COMMITTING

07:11.600 --> 07:13.266
CORPORATE SUICIDE."

07:13.333 --> 07:15.200
OR "AT&T, IF YOU RUN A CABLE OUT

07:15.266 --> 07:16.333
THE BACK OF YOUR HEADQUARTERS

07:16.400 --> 07:17.500
AND PLUG IT INTO T-MOBILE'S

07:17.566 --> 07:18.733
NETWORK WHILE THEY AREN'T

07:18.800 --> 07:19.500
LOOKING, THAT'S LEGAL, RIGHT?

07:19.566 --> 07:21.300
ASKING FOR A FRIEND."

07:21.366 --> 07:23.500
ANY OF THOSE ARE YOURS IF YOU

07:23.566 --> 07:24.333
WANT THEM!

07:24.400 --> 07:26.466
AND LOOK, AT&T, I KNOW OUR

07:26.533 --> 07:27.166
RELATIONSHIP IS A LITTLE

07:27.233 --> 07:29.133
AWKWARD, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE

07:29.200 --> 07:30.466
TRYING TO SPIN THIS BUSINESS

07:30.533 --> 07:31.333
BABY OFF IN YOUR DEAL WITH

07:31.400 --> 07:32.333
DISCOVERY.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.733
BUT WHILE WE'RE STILL

07:33.800 --> 07:38.833
TECHNICALLY RELATED, LET ME JUST

07:38.900 --> 07:39.200
SAY THIS.

07:39.266 --> 07:39.733
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE COMPANY.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.333
YOU DO BAD THINGS AND YOU MAKE

07:40.400 --> 07:41.000
THE WORLD WORSE.

07:41.066 --> 07:41.766
PLEASE DON'T BOTHER KEEPING IN

07:41.833 --> 07:42.366
TOUCH ONCE THE MERGER'S

07:42.433 --> 07:43.266
COMPLETE.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.100
ALTHOUGH THAT SHOULDN'T BE A

07:44.166 --> 07:45.533
PROBLEM.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.533
YOU'RE AT&T.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.466
IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR MESSAGES WILL

07:48.533 --> 07:51.500
GO THROUGH ANYWAY.

07:51.566 --> 07:58.100
AND NOW, THIS.

07:58.166 --> 08:01.700
>> AND NOW, FOX AND FRIENDS AS

08:01.766 --> 08:02.633
BRIAN KILL MEAD LIKES

08:02.700 --> 08:03.233
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WAY, WAY

08:03.300 --> 08:05.266
TOO MUCH.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.333
>> IF YOU READ ONE REPUTABLE

08:07.400 --> 08:09.033
BOOK ON COLUMBUS AND STILL DON'T

08:09.100 --> 08:09.733
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A

08:09.800 --> 08:12.333
COLUMBUS DAY, YOU'RE NOT PAYING

08:12.400 --> 08:12.600
ATTENTION.

08:12.666 --> 08:16.166
HE MARRIED TO WORLD OF THE TIME.

08:16.233 --> 08:19.666
I JUST DID THE MATH, 527 YEARS

08:19.733 --> 08:20.700
AGO, CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS

08:20.766 --> 08:21.800
DISCOVERED THE NEW WORLD.

08:21.866 --> 08:23.533
WHAT HE DID AS AN EXPLORER

08:23.600 --> 08:24.866
FIGHTING THE ODDS TO DO SO THEY

08:24.933 --> 08:28.066
SAID WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON

08:28.133 --> 08:30.800
TODAY BUT ONLY MORE DANGEROUS.

08:30.866 --> 08:31.433
ONE PERSON DESCRIBED AS GOING TO

08:31.500 --> 08:33.933
THE MOON BACK IN THE 1960s

08:34.000 --> 08:34.800
ONLY MORE DANGEROUS.

08:34.866 --> 08:37.333
ONLY IT WAS MORE DANGEROUS.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.100
ONLY MORE DANGEROUS.

08:38.166 --> 08:39.266
BASICALLY, HE DID THE EQUIVALENT

08:39.333 --> 08:41.366
OF GOING TO THE MOON IN THE

08:41.433 --> 08:42.133
1490s.

08:42.200 --> 08:42.933
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.066
ACTUALLY MORE DANGEROUS.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.066
I WAS ALMOST THE CHRISTOPHER

08:50.133 --> 08:50.733
COLUMBUS OF THE SHOW.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.966
>> YOU ARE THE CHRISTOPHER

08:52.033 --> 08:54.800
COLUMBUS OF PET GIVES.

08:54.866 --> 08:56.866
>> SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK

08:56.933 --> 08:57.466
COLUMBUS IS ACTUALLY SPANISH.

08:57.533 --> 09:00.600
>> I DON'T BUY THAT AT ALL.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.800
I READ FOUR VOYAGES AND TOTALLY

09:02.866 --> 09:03.133
ITALIAN.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.000
COULDN'T BE MORE ITALIAN.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.433
I WAS COLUMBUS FOR HALLOWEEN, NO

09:07.500 --> 09:07.866
PICTURES AVAILABLE.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.766
>> I'M LIKE WHAT YOU TALKING

09:10.833 --> 09:11.600
ABOUT?

09:11.666 --> 09:12.800
>> John: MOVING ON.

09:12.866 --> 09:13.733
FOR A MAIN STORY TONIGHT, WE'RE

09:13.800 --> 09:15.533
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

09:15.600 --> 09:17.866
INTERNET, MAGICAL PLACE WHERE

09:17.933 --> 09:18.866
YOU FIND COMMUNITIES OF

09:18.933 --> 09:19.500
LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS LIKE A

09:19.566 --> 09:22.700
TIKTOKER WHO CREATED THE STORY

09:22.766 --> 09:23.900
ABOUT THINGS NARROWLY FITTING

09:23.966 --> 09:25.533
INTO TIGHT SPACES, SOMETHING THE

09:25.600 --> 09:26.133
SUCCEEDING WEEK BRITISH WOMAN

09:26.200 --> 09:28.866
WAS A BIG FAN OF.

09:28.933 --> 09:29.733
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO!

09:29.800 --> 09:30.166
OH, THAT WENT NICE.

09:30.233 --> 09:30.800
THAT LITERALLY FITTED PERFECTLY.

09:30.866 --> 09:33.666
OH, THAT'S NICE.

09:33.733 --> 09:34.266
OH, BLOODY HELL, BIT CLOSE FOR

09:34.333 --> 09:37.200
COMFORT, THAT.

09:37.266 --> 09:38.466
STRESSING ME OUT A BIT, BUT THAT

09:38.533 --> 09:49.300
WERE NICE.

09:49.366 --> 09:49.566
OH, GO ON!

09:49.633 --> 09:49.933
OH, YES, GO ON.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.533
HOW'D YOU FIND THAT ALL THESE

09:50.600 --> 09:51.133
THINGS FIT, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I

09:51.200 --> 09:51.333
MEAN?

09:51.400 --> 09:51.966
DID YOU JUST SIT IN YOUR HOUSE

09:52.033 --> 09:52.566
AND JUST SEE IF THINGS FIT IN

09:52.633 --> 09:53.433
HOLES?

09:53.500 --> 09:54.133
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:54.200 --> 09:54.666
SHE'S ASKING A LEGITIMATE

09:54.733 --> 09:57.600
QUESTION THERE.

09:57.666 --> 09:58.166
AND I DO THINK THE ANSWER IS

09:58.233 --> 09:59.033
"YES."

09:59.100 --> 10:00.000
BUT SADLY, OUR STORY ISN'T GOING

10:00.066 --> 10:00.633
TO BE ABOUT THE FUN SIDE OF THE

10:00.700 --> 10:01.966
INTERNET.

10:02.033 --> 10:02.633
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THE

10:02.700 --> 10:04.533
RAMPANT MISINFORMATION ON IT.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.833
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE COVERED

10:05.900 --> 10:06.800
MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE, FROM ALEX

10:06.866 --> 10:08.366
JONES TO VACCINE MISINFORMATION

10:08.433 --> 10:10.066
TO CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

10:10.133 --> 10:11.766
BUT TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK

10:11.833 --> 10:12.533
SPECIFICALLY AT MISINFORMATION

10:12.600 --> 10:13.400
THAT SPREADS AMONG IMMIGRANT,

10:13.466 --> 10:15.133
DIASPORA COMMUNITIES.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.800
BASICALLY, INSTEAD OF STUFF LIKE

10:16.866 --> 10:17.966
THIS FACEBOOK POST IN ENGLISH,

10:18.033 --> 10:19.200
TITLED "THE FAKE VACCINATION OF

10:19.266 --> 10:20.200
KAMALA HARRIS," WHICH,

10:20.266 --> 10:21.233
INCIDENTALLY, FACEBOOK HAS

10:21.300 --> 10:24.200
FLAGGED AS FALSE INFORMATION,

10:24.266 --> 10:27.400
WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

10:27.466 --> 10:31.166
STUFF LIKE THIS POST IN SPANISH,

10:31.233 --> 10:32.800
FEATURING THE EXACT SAME VIDEO

10:32.866 --> 10:33.666
WHICH -- AS OF THIS TAPING --

10:33.733 --> 10:34.133
HAS NO SUCH WARNING.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.666
AND THAT ACTUALLY ISN'T THAT

10:35.733 --> 10:36.233
SURPRISING WHEN YOU CONSIDER

10:36.300 --> 10:36.866
THAT -- ACCORDING TO THE RECENT

10:36.933 --> 10:37.466
FACEBOOK FILES EXPOSE -- WHILE

10:37.533 --> 10:37.966
MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF

10:38.033 --> 10:39.066
FACEBOOK'S MONTHLY USERS ARE

10:39.133 --> 10:41.300
OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND CANADA,

10:41.366 --> 10:42.133
WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOURS THE

10:42.200 --> 10:43.566
COMPANY SPENDS ON MONITORING

10:43.633 --> 10:45.000
MISINFORMATION, LAST YEAR, ONLY

10:45.066 --> 10:48.166
13% WERE SPENT ON CONTENT FROM

10:48.233 --> 10:50.066
OUTSIDE THE U.S.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.733
SO IT SEEMS THAT FACEBOOK'S

10:51.800 --> 10:52.300
ADOPTED THE SAME GENERAL

10:52.366 --> 10:53.766
ATTITUDE TO MISINFORMATION THAT

10:53.833 --> 10:54.833
THE OSCARS TOOK TOWARD BEST

10:54.900 --> 10:56.066
PICTURES FOR THE FIRST 90 YEARS

10:56.133 --> 10:57.000
OF ITS EXISTENCE.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.933
BASICALLY, IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

10:59.000 --> 11:00.133
IN ENGLISH, IT DOESN'T

11:00.200 --> 11:01.933
FUNDAMENTALLY MATTER.

11:02.000 --> 11:02.966
AND THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION

11:03.033 --> 11:04.733
HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.766
WHEN A REPORTER RECENTLY TRIED

11:05.833 --> 11:06.966
TO FIGURE OUT WHY VACCINATION

11:07.033 --> 11:08.333
RATES AMONG LATINO COMMUNITIES

11:08.400 --> 11:09.900
IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY

11:09.966 --> 11:12.000
REMAIN LOW, ONE WOMAN EXPLAINED

11:12.066 --> 11:14.266
HER RELUCTANCE LIKE THIS.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.033
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

11:15.100 --> 11:15.566
>> I'VE LISTENED TO HEALTH

11:15.633 --> 11:16.600
LEADERS.

11:16.666 --> 11:18.233
>> LIKE WHO?

11:18.300 --> 11:19.333
>> THERE'S A DOCTOR WHO I'VE

11:19.400 --> 11:20.133
HEARD AND SEEN IN SOME

11:20.200 --> 11:21.533
DOCUMENTARIES WHO SAYS THAT THE

11:21.600 --> 11:26.466
VIRUS IS CURABLE.

11:26.533 --> 11:27.000
I FOUND ONE OF THE FEMALE

11:27.066 --> 11:29.366
DOCTOR.

11:29.433 --> 11:30.500
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR

11:30.566 --> 11:31.500
MY PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR IS TO

11:31.566 --> 11:32.933
SAY NO.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.233
WE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING THE

11:34.300 --> 11:35.566
COVID VACCINE.

11:35.633 --> 11:37.133
>> HOW DID YOU FIND THIS VIDEO?

11:37.200 --> 11:39.400
>> MY MOTHER SENT IT TO ME.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.533
>> THROUGH WHAT MEANS?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.266
>> SHE SENT IT THROUGH FACEBOOK.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.366
>> WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THIS

11:45.433 --> 11:46.466
DOCTOR AND NOT SOMEONE LIKE DR.

11:46.533 --> 11:48.400
FAUCI?

11:48.466 --> 11:50.000
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN DR. FAUCI.

11:50.066 --> 11:50.466
>> NEVER?

11:50.533 --> 11:52.266
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.666
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT!

11:53.733 --> 11:54.300
IS IT?

11:54.366 --> 11:55.266
AND IT'S A PRETTY GOOD REMINDER

11:55.333 --> 11:59.733
OF HOW, THANKS TO SOCIAL MEDIA,

11:59.800 --> 12:00.333
IT'S POSSIBLE TO SILO YOURSELF

12:00.400 --> 12:00.900
OFF AND HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

12:00.966 --> 12:01.400
EXPERIENCES OF LIVING IN

12:01.466 --> 12:02.466
AMERICA.

12:02.533 --> 12:03.466
BECAUSE SHE WAS AWARE OF A

12:03.533 --> 12:04.933
DOCTOR FROM EL SALVADOR PEDDLING

12:05.000 --> 12:06.200
BULLSHIT COVID CURES, BUT HAD

12:06.266 --> 12:08.666
NEVER HEARD OF DR. FAUCI.

12:08.733 --> 12:09.733
AND ON THAT POINT, I HONESTLY

12:09.800 --> 12:11.733
KIND OF ENVY HER.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.100
WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT FAUCI,

12:13.166 --> 12:14.533
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE, IT

12:14.600 --> 12:15.300
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO HAVE

12:15.366 --> 12:17.166
SEEN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS OF HIM

12:17.233 --> 12:19.033
OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.600
THAT WOMAN WILL NEVER KNOW THE

12:20.666 --> 12:21.933
DYSTOPIAN HELL OF SEEING FAUCI

12:22.000 --> 12:23.966
SUPERIMPOSED OVER A VOTIVE

12:24.033 --> 12:25.633
CANDLE OR HEARING PEOPLE REFER

12:25.700 --> 12:27.866
TO THE VACCINE AS A FAUCI

12:27.933 --> 12:28.800
OUCHIE.

12:28.866 --> 12:30.233
SHE ENJOYS AN INNER PEACE I WILL

12:30.300 --> 12:31.800
NEVER KNOW.

12:31.866 --> 12:33.133
AND LOOK, WE CLEARLY HAVEN'T

12:33.200 --> 12:34.200
REMOTELY FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO

12:34.266 --> 12:36.000
WITH ENGLISH-LANGUAGE

12:36.066 --> 12:37.100
MISINFORMATION YET, AS PROVEN BY

12:37.166 --> 12:37.733
THE FACT THAT WHEN I SAY THE

12:37.800 --> 12:39.966
WORDS "HORSE DEWORMER" OR "THE

12:40.033 --> 12:42.033
LETTER Q," YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

12:42.100 --> 12:43.466
I'M REFERRING TO.

12:43.533 --> 12:44.666
BUT WHILE I KNOW IT'S HARD TO

12:44.733 --> 12:45.333
IMAGINE THAT THE SITUATION COULD

12:45.400 --> 12:47.900
BE WORSE, WHEN IT COMES TO

12:48.000 --> 12:49.566
NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE

12:49.633 --> 12:51.766
MISINFORMATION, IT HONESTLY IS.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.300
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

12:53.366 --> 12:54.600
MISINFORMATION IN DIASPORA

12:54.666 --> 12:56.000
COMMUNITIES, HOW EASILY IT CAN

12:56.066 --> 12:57.000
BE SPREAD, AND WHAT CAN BE DONE

12:57.066 --> 12:57.833
ABOUT IT.

12:57.900 --> 12:58.933
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

12:59.000 --> 13:00.800
THAT WHILE SOME MISINFORMATION

13:00.866 --> 13:01.733
IS BASICALLY THE SAME IN OTHER

13:01.800 --> 13:02.933
LANGUAGES, IN OTHER CASES, IT

13:03.000 --> 13:04.866
TAPS INTO CULTURALLY SPECIFIC

13:04.933 --> 13:06.600
INTERESTS OR FEARS.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.033
FOR INSTANCE, COMMUNITIES WITH

13:08.100 --> 13:09.466
LIVED EXPERIENCE UNDER COMMUNIST

13:09.533 --> 13:10.566
OR SOCIALIST REGIMES ARE OFTEN

13:10.633 --> 13:11.600
TARGETED WITH MISINFORMATION

13:11.666 --> 13:13.033
THAT TRIES TO STOKE FEARS ABOUT

13:13.100 --> 13:14.333
SOCIALISM.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.633
IN FACT, JOE BIDEN'S

13:15.700 --> 13:16.500
UNDERPERFORMANCE IN

13:16.566 --> 13:18.400
MAJORITY-LATINO AREAS IN FLORIDA

13:18.466 --> 13:19.633
MAY HAVE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH

13:19.700 --> 13:25.066
THE FACT THAT CUBAN COMMUNITIES,

13:25.133 --> 13:25.700
WERE INUNDATED BY FALSE CLAIMS

13:25.766 --> 13:26.800
LIKE THIS.

13:26.866 --> 13:27.866
>> FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS, MANY

13:27.933 --> 13:30.300
HISPANIC-AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE

13:30.366 --> 13:31.366
SEEN REPORTS AND IMAGES TRYING

13:31.433 --> 13:33.933
TO TIE JOE BIDEN TO SOCIALISM.

13:34.000 --> 13:34.500
FOR INSTANCE, THIS PHOTO HAS

13:34.566 --> 13:35.566
BEEN FLOATING AROUND ON SOCIAL

13:35.633 --> 13:36.700
MEDIA.

13:36.766 --> 13:38.233
IT CLAIMS TO BE JILL BIDEN NEXT

13:38.300 --> 13:39.900
TO FIDEL CASTRO.

13:39.966 --> 13:42.833
BUT IN FACT, THIS IS FALSE.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.833
IT'S ACTUALLY A PHOTO OF LATE

13:44.900 --> 13:45.800
NORWEGIAN EXPLORER THOR

13:45.866 --> 13:47.966
HEYERDAHL AND HIS WIFE,

13:48.033 --> 13:50.400
JACQUELINE BIER.

13:50.466 --> 13:51.000
>> John: OKAY, THAT PHOTO IS

13:51.066 --> 13:52.400
CLEARLY NOT JILL BIDEN.

13:52.466 --> 13:53.333
AND THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT JOE

13:53.400 --> 13:54.666
BIDEN.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.133
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS A LOT MORE

13:56.200 --> 13:57.833
LIKE HIM THAN THIS ANIMATRONIC

13:57.900 --> 13:58.433
VERSION AT DISNEY WORLD'S HALL

13:58.500 --> 14:00.066
OF PRESIDENTS DOES.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.166
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

14:02.233 --> 14:03.400
THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD

14:03.466 --> 14:04.100
HAPPEN IF AN ELDERLY ANDERSON

14:04.166 --> 14:05.333
COOPER GOT A FACELIFT FROM A

14:05.400 --> 14:06.300
PLASTIC SURGEON WITHOUT A

14:06.366 --> 14:08.566
MEDICAL LICENSE.

14:08.633 --> 14:10.066
AND SOMETIMES, THE SPREAD OF

14:10.133 --> 14:11.300
MISINFORMATION IS EXACERBATED BY

14:11.366 --> 14:12.866
THE FACT THAT, FOR MANY DIASPORA

14:12.933 --> 14:14.233
COMMUNITIES HERE IN THE U.S.,

14:14.300 --> 14:15.466
THERE JUST AREN'T MANY

14:15.533 --> 14:16.000
ALTERNATIVES IN THEIR OWN

14:16.066 --> 14:17.533
LANGUAGES.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.166
FOR MANY OLDER VIETNAMESE

14:19.233 --> 14:20.433
AMERICANS, THERE'S SUCH A VACUUM

14:20.500 --> 14:22.200
OF CREDIBLE NEWS CHANNELS THAT

14:22.266 --> 14:23.800
BROADCAST IN VIETNAMESE THAT

14:23.866 --> 14:25.200
MANY TURN TO YOUTUBE FOR THEIR

14:25.266 --> 14:27.500
NEWS, WITH CERTAIN CHANNELS ON

14:27.566 --> 14:29.566
IN THEIR HOUSES 24/7.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.300
ONE POPULAR HOST BASED HERE IN

14:31.366 --> 14:33.266
THE U.S. IS NGUY VU, WHO BRANDS

14:33.333 --> 14:34.900
HIMSELF "KING RADIO."

14:34.966 --> 14:36.166
HE'S BASICALLY A VIETNAMESE ALEX

14:36.233 --> 14:37.166
JONES, AS YOU CAN SEE IN RANTS

14:37.233 --> 14:40.100
LIKE THESE.

14:40.166 --> 14:40.733
>> CHINA COMPLETELY HAS CONTROL

14:40.800 --> 14:41.833
OF BIDEN.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.000
THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH HUNTER

14:43.066 --> 14:44.500
BIDEN'S LAPTOP AND THE TROVE OF

14:44.566 --> 14:47.633
DATA IT CONTAINS, I THINK XI

14:47.700 --> 14:48.366
JINPING HAS GOT HIS HANDS ON ALL

14:48.433 --> 14:50.733
OF IT.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.033
GEORGE SOROS WAS PART OF THE

14:52.100 --> 14:52.766
FINANCIAL PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE

14:52.833 --> 14:57.400
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

14:57.466 --> 14:58.533
WHY ARE WE STILL BEING FORCED TO

14:58.600 --> 14:59.833
WEAR MASKS?

14:59.900 --> 15:03.400
MASKS ARE KILLING PEOPLE.

15:03.466 --> 15:04.366
IF YOU'RE IN A STATE THAT GIVES

15:04.433 --> 15:05.633
YOU THE RIGHT TO NOT WEAR A

15:05.700 --> 15:07.166
MASK, AND THEN YOU ENTER

15:07.233 --> 15:08.533
SOMEONE'S HOUSE BUT THEY TRY TO

15:08.600 --> 15:10.066
MAKE YOU WEAR ONE, TELL THEM

15:10.133 --> 15:13.066
"FUCK YOU."

15:13.133 --> 15:14.000
>> John: I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE

15:14.066 --> 15:15.333
WHERE THE ALEX JONES COMPARISONS

15:15.400 --> 15:16.666
COME FROM.

15:16.733 --> 15:17.700
BOTH HAVE VOICES THAT SOUND LIKE

15:17.766 --> 15:18.900
BONES GOING THROUGH A WOOD

15:18.966 --> 15:20.133
CHIPPER, BOTH HAVE AN INABILITY

15:20.200 --> 15:21.766
TO CONTROL THE VOLUME OF SAID

15:21.833 --> 15:24.500
VOICES, AND BOTH HAVE SETS

15:24.566 --> 15:25.133
CLEARLY INSPIRED BY A WINDOWS 95

15:25.200 --> 15:26.733
SCREENSAVER.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.933
ALSO, THEY SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME

15:29.000 --> 15:30.766
BUSINESS MODEL WITH KING RADIO

15:30.833 --> 15:32.033
SELLING HIS AUDIENCE VIAGRA,

15:32.100 --> 15:33.633
MEDICATIONS, AND BEAUTY CREAMS

15:33.700 --> 15:34.666
THAT HE CLAIMS ARE MADE BY HIS

15:34.733 --> 15:35.733
COUSIN.

15:35.800 --> 15:40.000
WHICH SHOULD BE A HUGE RED FLAG.

15:40.066 --> 15:40.800
UNLESS HIS COUSIN IS NAMED STEVE

15:40.866 --> 15:42.600
CLINIQUE, I DO NOT WANT ANY

15:42.666 --> 15:44.900
CREAMS FROM THAT INDIVIDUAL.

15:44.966 --> 15:45.900
BUT AGAIN, WHILE ALEX JONES HAS

15:45.966 --> 15:48.033
BEEN REMOVED FROM YOUTUBE FOR

15:48.100 --> 15:49.333
SPREADING MISINFORMATION, KING

15:49.400 --> 15:52.566
RADIO IS STILL GOING STRONG ON

15:52.633 --> 15:53.666
THE PLATFORM, DESPITE THE FACT

15:53.733 --> 15:55.966
YOU JUST HEARD HIM SAY, "MASKS

15:56.033 --> 15:58.200
ARE KILLING PEOPLE," WHICH

15:58.266 --> 15:59.100
CLEARLY VIOLATES YOUTUBE'S BAN

15:59.166 --> 15:59.733
ON CLAIMS THAT WEARING A MASK IS

15:59.800 --> 16:07.566
DANGEROUS.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.300
AND WHAT I GUESS THIS MEANS IS,

16:08.366 --> 16:08.933
ALEX JONES COULD PROBABLY FIND

16:09.000 --> 16:10.066
HIS WAY BACK ONTO YOUTUBE.

16:10.133 --> 16:10.633
HE JUST NEEDS TO COMPLETE A

16:10.700 --> 16:14.400
ROSETTA STONE VIETNAMESE COURSE.

16:14.466 --> 16:15.100
AND AS BAD AS FACEBOOK AND

16:15.166 --> 16:15.866
YOUTUBE ARE -- AND THEY ARE

16:15.933 --> 16:16.800
SCREAMINGLY BAD -- AT LEAST IN

16:16.866 --> 16:18.500
THEORY, THEY CAN BE MONITORED.

16:18.566 --> 16:19.500
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY

16:19.566 --> 16:21.100
MISINFORMATION SPREADS THAT'S

16:21.166 --> 16:22.433
ACTUALLY INVISIBLE TO MOST

16:22.500 --> 16:24.600
PEOPLE, AND UNFORTUNATELY, ALSO

16:24.666 --> 16:25.900
HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

16:25.966 --> 16:27.566
POPULAR TOOLS OF COMMUNICATION

16:27.633 --> 16:29.000
AMONG IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES, AND

16:29.066 --> 16:31.833
THAT IS PRIVATE MESSAGING APPS.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.233
THE BIGGEST, BY FAR, IS

16:33.300 --> 16:34.366
WHATSAPP, OWNED BY FACEBOOK,

16:34.433 --> 16:35.233
WHICH IS MASSIVE ALL OVER THE

16:35.300 --> 16:37.233
WORLD.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.100
SO MUCH SO, IT'S BECOME PART OF

16:39.166 --> 16:41.200
MANY PEOPLE'S DAILY ROUTINE.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.200
IN INDIA, SENDING "GOOD MORNING"

16:43.266 --> 16:45.200
MESSAGES ON WHATSAPP IS

16:45.266 --> 16:46.100
INCREDIBLY POPULAR, MEANING

16:46.166 --> 16:48.533
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WAKE UP TO

16:48.600 --> 16:50.033
RELATIVES HAVING SENT THEM ONE

16:50.100 --> 16:51.133
OF THESE, OR EVEN A VIDEO LIKE

16:51.200 --> 16:56.200
THIS.

16:56.266 --> 17:08.166
♪ ♪

17:08.233 --> 17:09.033
I WILL SAY, THAT'S AN

17:09.100 --> 17:09.866
AGGRESSIVELY PLEASANT WAY TO

17:09.933 --> 17:11.966
WAKE UP!

17:12.033 --> 17:13.566
WHEN WE CAME ACROSS THAT MESSAGE

17:13.633 --> 17:14.933
UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE, THE TOP

17:15.033 --> 17:16.733
CMMENT WAS SIMPLY "NICE."

17:16.800 --> 17:18.866
WHICH IS PRETTY STRIKING.

17:18.933 --> 17:20.400
NOTHING ELSE ON THE PLATFORM HAS

17:20.466 --> 17:21.766
A RESPONSE THAT WHOLESOME.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.033
YOU JUST KNOW THE AMERICAN

17:24.100 --> 17:25.166
VERSION OF GOOD MORNING WOULD

17:25.233 --> 17:25.866
HAVE A TOP COMMENT LIKE "YOU

17:25.933 --> 17:27.200
KNOW WHO HAD A SHIT MORNING?

17:27.266 --> 17:28.000
HARAMBE.

17:28.066 --> 17:30.866
REST IN PEACE, KING."

17:30.933 --> 17:32.766
BUT IT'S NOT JUST WHATSAPP.

17:32.833 --> 17:33.333
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES HAVE THEIR

17:33.400 --> 17:34.566
OWN PREFERRED APP.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.300
KOREAN IMMIGRANTS HAVE

17:36.366 --> 17:36.866
KAKAOTALK, WHILE MORE RECENT

17:36.933 --> 17:38.633
CHINESE IMMIGRANTS USE WECHAT.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.533
AND IF YOU'RE NOT ON THESE APPS,

17:40.600 --> 17:42.066
IT CAN BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND

17:42.133 --> 17:43.166
JUST HOW CENTRAL THEY ARE TO

17:43.233 --> 17:45.700
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

17:45.766 --> 17:47.633
>> THIS TUNE AND LOADING SCREEN

17:47.700 --> 17:49.633
ARE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE TO

17:49.700 --> 17:50.500
OVER ONE BILLION PEOPLE AROUND

17:50.566 --> 17:52.933
THE WORLD.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.166
IN CHINA, WHERE MOST WESTERN

17:55.233 --> 17:55.766
SOCIAL MEDIA IS BANNED, WECHAT

17:55.833 --> 17:58.500
IS ESSENTIAL.

17:58.566 --> 17:59.633
PEOPLE USE IT TO TEXT EACH

17:59.700 --> 18:01.033
OTHER, ORDER FOOD, HAIL RIDES,

18:01.100 --> 18:03.633
AND PAY FOR THINGS.

18:03.700 --> 18:04.833
OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE DIASPORA

18:04.900 --> 18:06.600
USES IT TO CONNECT WITH FELLOW

18:06.666 --> 18:08.333
CHINESE SPEAKERS AND ISSUES IN

18:08.400 --> 18:09.766
THE COUNTRY THEY'RE LIVING IN.

18:09.833 --> 18:10.500
>> John: EXACTLY.

18:10.566 --> 18:12.033
COMMUNICATION, FOOD ORDERS,

18:12.100 --> 18:13.566
TRAVEL, PAYMENT, EVERYTHING, ALL

18:13.633 --> 18:15.166
IN ONE APP.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.000
THAT'S SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT

18:17.066 --> 18:18.633
THAN THE U.S.-BASED MODEL, WHERE

18:18.700 --> 18:19.666
YOU HAVE ONE APP TO CONVINCE YOU

18:19.733 --> 18:20.900
EVERYONE'S HAVING A BETTER TIME

18:20.966 --> 18:22.800
THAN YOU, ONE THAT FUNCTIONS AS

18:22.866 --> 18:24.033
AN ENDLESSLY REFRESHING FURY

18:24.100 --> 18:25.400
GENERATOR, ONE FOR PRETENDING

18:25.466 --> 18:26.366
YOU'LL MEDITATE ONE DAY, ONE

18:26.433 --> 18:27.733
THAT LETS YOU PAY TOO MUCH FOR

18:27.800 --> 18:29.033
FAST FOOD, ONE FOR HORNY

18:29.100 --> 18:30.500
MISTAKES, AND ONE THAT SIMPLY

18:30.566 --> 18:31.333
LETS YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE VERY

18:31.400 --> 18:31.900
OLD AND THE WORLD NO LONGER

18:31.966 --> 18:34.433
BELONGS TO YOU.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.633
SO I GUESS, IN A WAY, KUDOS TO

18:36.700 --> 18:37.900
WECHAT FOR STREAMLINING OUR

18:37.966 --> 18:39.733
SHARED DIGITAL NIGHTMARE INTO

18:39.800 --> 18:41.933
ONE CONVENIENT PLACE.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.033
SO THESE APPS ARE A CHEAP AND

18:43.100 --> 18:44.633
UBIQUITOUS WAY TO ALLOW PEOPLE

18:44.700 --> 18:45.500
TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY AND

18:45.566 --> 18:47.200
FRIENDS, AND ALSO GET NEWS AND

18:47.266 --> 18:49.366
SHARE INFORMATION IN THEIR HOME

18:49.433 --> 18:50.200
LANGUAGES.

18:50.266 --> 18:52.533
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY APPEALING.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.900
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'RE ALSO A

18:53.966 --> 18:58.933
HUGE VECTOR FOR MISINFORMATION.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.566
>> THERE IS ACTUALLY A SAYING IN

18:59.633 --> 19:00.266
THE LATINO COMMUNITY, IN THE

19:00.333 --> 19:01.666
VENEZUELAN AND CUBAN COMMUNITIES

19:01.733 --> 19:02.966
ABOUT LA TIA DEL WHATSAPP.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.033
IT'S THE AUNT THAT GOES ON

19:04.100 --> 19:06.600
WHATSAPP AND RECEIVES ANY TYPE

19:06.666 --> 19:07.766
OF CONSPIRACY THEORY AND

19:07.833 --> 19:09.733
FORWARDS IT TO ALL HER CONTACTS.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.533
WE ALL HAVE SOMEBODY IN OUR

19:10.600 --> 19:12.200
FAMILY LIKE THAT.

19:12.266 --> 19:14.200
>> John: OH, YEAH, WE DO.

19:14.266 --> 19:16.033
AND IT'S ALMOST COMFORTING TO

19:16.100 --> 19:16.833
KNOW THAT REGARDLESS OF

19:16.900 --> 19:19.366
BACKGROUND, EVERY SINGLE FAMILY

19:19.433 --> 19:21.000
HAS ONE MEMBER THAT WHEN ANYONE

19:21.066 --> 19:22.066
GETS A MESSAGE FROM THEM, THE

19:22.133 --> 19:23.433
FIRST RESPONSE IS TO GO "OH,

19:23.500 --> 19:26.233
SHIT, WHAT NOW?"

19:26.300 --> 19:27.233
IT'S A TRULY UNIVERSAL

19:27.300 --> 19:29.433
EXPERIENCE.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.466
AND THERE ARE PARTICULAR REASONS

19:30.533 --> 19:32.100
THESE APPS HAVE BECOME

19:32.166 --> 19:32.700
ESPECIALLY FERTILE GROUNDS FOR

19:32.766 --> 19:33.633
MISINFORMATION.

19:33.700 --> 19:34.966
FOR INSTANCE, IN MANY COUNTRIES,

19:35.033 --> 19:36.666
FACEBOOK -- WHICH, REMEMBER,

19:36.733 --> 19:39.033
OWNS WHATSAPP -- HAS PARTNERED

19:39.100 --> 19:40.166
WITH MOBILE PHONE CARRIERS TO

19:40.233 --> 19:42.000
MAKE ACCESSING ITS SERVICES A

19:42.066 --> 19:43.900
LOT CHEAPER THAN ACCESSING THE

19:43.966 --> 19:45.366
REST OF THE INTERNET.

19:45.433 --> 19:46.933
SO MISINFORMATION CAN SPREAD FAR

19:47.000 --> 19:48.033
AND WIDE WITHOUT THE SAME

19:48.100 --> 19:50.033
ABILITY TO CHECK IT.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.266
IN BRAZIL, A BROADBAND

19:52.333 --> 19:53.800
CONNECTION CAN COST UP TO 15

19:53.866 --> 19:55.366
PERCENT OF A HOUSEHOLD'S INCOME,

19:55.433 --> 19:57.300
ESSENTIALLY MAKING FACT-CHECKING

19:57.366 --> 19:58.833
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE AVERAGE

19:58.900 --> 19:59.600
BRAZILIAN.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.666
WHICH IS A TRULY TERRIFYING

20:00.733 --> 20:03.400
THOUGHT.

20:03.466 --> 20:04.466
AND WECHAT HAS ITS OWN FEATURES

20:04.533 --> 20:05.033
THAT MAKE SOURCING HARDER TO

20:05.100 --> 20:05.866
FOLLOW.

20:05.933 --> 20:07.000
BECAUSE IT HAS A FUNCTION FOR

20:07.066 --> 20:11.600
USERS TO SET THEMSELVES UP AS

20:11.666 --> 20:12.300
WHAT'S KNOWN AS SELF-MEDIA --

20:12.366 --> 20:12.933
BASICALLY A PSEUDO "NEWS

20:13.000 --> 20:13.566
CHANNEL," BUT THERE'S A CRUCIAL

20:13.633 --> 20:15.033
LIMITATION THERE.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.166
>> WHILE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER

20:16.233 --> 20:17.866
GENERALLY ALLOW PUBLISHERS TO

20:17.933 --> 20:19.633
POST LINKS THAT TAKE USERS TO

20:19.700 --> 20:21.200
OTHER WEBSITES, WECHAT BANS MOST

20:21.266 --> 20:22.466
PUBLISHERS FROM EMBEDDING

20:22.533 --> 20:24.700
HYPERLINKS IN ARTICLES.

20:24.766 --> 20:25.933
THIS MEANS PRETTY MUCH

20:26.000 --> 20:26.766
EVERYTHING IS SELF-CONTAINED ON

20:26.833 --> 20:28.900
THE PLATFORM.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.400
IT'S HARD TO FIND THE ORIGINAL

20:30.466 --> 20:40.466
SOURCE MATERIAL AND DEBUNK IT.

20:40.533 --> 20:41.100
>> John: RIGHT, AND THAT'S A BIG

20:41.166 --> 20:41.733
DEAL, BECAUSE WHO YOUR SOURCE IS

20:41.800 --> 20:41.966
MATTERS!

20:42.033 --> 20:42.600
A BOOK CALLED "HOW I BROKE RULES

20:42.666 --> 20:43.100
AND MADE HISTORY" READS

20:43.166 --> 20:43.733
COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY IF IT WAS

20:43.800 --> 20:44.333
WRITTEN BY RUTH BADER GINSBURG

20:44.400 --> 20:46.633
OR OSAMA BIN LADEN.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.100
SO MISINFORMATION CAN CIRCULATE

20:49.166 --> 20:49.900
FREELY ON MESSAGING APPS, AND IN

20:49.966 --> 20:51.400
CLOSED GROUPS, BASICALLY

20:51.466 --> 20:53.633
INVISIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC,

20:53.700 --> 20:57.333
AND SOMETIMES, WHEN THE MESSAGES

20:57.400 --> 20:57.933
ARE END-TO-END ENCRYPTED, EVEN

20:58.000 --> 20:58.966
TO THE COMPANIES THAT HOST THEM.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.266
AND THEY'RE OFTEN BEING PASSED

21:00.333 --> 21:02.033
AROUND BY TRUSTED FRIENDS AND

21:02.100 --> 21:03.400
FAMILY MEMBERS, LENDING THEM AN

21:03.466 --> 21:05.366
AURA OF LEGITIMACY.

21:05.433 --> 21:07.200
AND IT CAN BE TRULY EXASPERATING

21:07.266 --> 21:08.400
FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE TO SEE JUST

21:08.466 --> 21:09.366
HOW SUSCEPTIBLE THEIR RELATIVES

21:09.433 --> 21:11.733
ARE TO THIS BULLSHIT.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.166
SUBREDDITS LIKE "ASIAN PARENT

21:13.233 --> 21:15.000
STORIES" ARE FULL OF POSTS LIKE

21:15.066 --> 21:18.633
"WECHAT FUCKED UP MY PARENTS."

21:18.700 --> 21:20.166
AND LISTEN TO THIS WOMAN READ A

21:20.233 --> 21:21.100
MESSAGE THAT WAS FLYING AROUND

21:21.166 --> 21:21.833
HER SOUTH AFRICAN FAMILY'S

21:21.900 --> 21:25.533
WHATSAPP GROUP.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.166
>> "PLEASE DO NOT FULL PETROL TO

21:26.233 --> 21:27.700
THE MAXIMUM LIMIT.

21:27.766 --> 21:29.033
IT MAY CAUSE EXPLOSION.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.833
THIS WEEK, FIVE EXPLOSION

21:30.900 --> 21:32.233
ACCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED DUE TO

21:32.300 --> 21:33.966
FILLING PETROL TO THE MAXIMUM.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.566
PLEASE DO SHARE THIS MESSAGE.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.366
RESCUE 1122."

21:37.433 --> 21:38.833
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT, I'VE

21:38.900 --> 21:40.400
NEVER SEEN IT, SO I DON'T SEE

21:40.466 --> 21:41.266
HOW SHE BELIEVES IT.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.100
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:42.166 --> 21:45.800
BECAUSE WHATSAPP SAYS SO, IT'S

21:45.866 --> 21:46.000
TRUE.

21:46.066 --> 21:47.500
YOUR CAR'S GONNA EXPLODE.

21:47.566 --> 21:53.800
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE!

21:53.866 --> 21:54.200
I MEAN, IT'S NOT.

21:54.266 --> 21:54.833
YOUR CAR'S NOT GOING TO EXPLODE.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.266
WHAT'S TRUE IS THAT

21:55.333 --> 21:55.833
MISINFORMATION LIKE THAT IS

21:55.900 --> 21:57.100
EVERYWHERE ON THESE APPS.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.900
OUR OWN STAFF HAS HAD FAMILY

21:58.966 --> 22:00.800
MEMBERS CIRCULATE THINGS LIKE

22:00.866 --> 22:02.133
THESE VIDEOS IN KOREAN PROMOTING

22:02.200 --> 22:03.633
CONSPIRACY THEORIES LIKE QANON,

22:03.700 --> 22:04.800
OR THIS POST ABOUT HOW AYURVEDIC

22:04.866 --> 22:06.666
DOCTORS SAY WE CAN SAVE

22:06.733 --> 22:07.966
OURSELVES FROM CORONAVIRUS, WITH

22:08.033 --> 22:13.433
TIPS LIKE "BOILED BLACK PEPPERS

22:13.500 --> 22:14.066
IN WATER AND ADD LEMON JUICE, IT

22:14.133 --> 22:14.633
KILLS THE VIRUS."

22:14.700 --> 22:18.633
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT NEWS IF IT

22:18.700 --> 22:19.833
WAS TRUE, BUT IT ISN'T.

22:19.900 --> 22:20.433
THIS PROBLEM IS SO FAMILIAR TO

22:20.500 --> 22:21.733
YOUNGER GENERATIONS THAT ONE SON

22:21.800 --> 22:22.733
OF INDIAN PARENTS MOCKED IT ON

22:22.800 --> 22:24.333
TIKTOK LIKE THIS.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.466
>> HERE'S HOW YOU MAKE BROWN

22:25.533 --> 22:26.333
PARENTS BELIEVE LITERALLY

22:26.400 --> 22:27.833
ANYTHING.

22:27.900 --> 22:28.700
YOU'RE GONNA START WITH A PLAIN

22:28.766 --> 22:29.300
BACKGROUND AND WRITE WHATEVER

22:29.366 --> 22:30.800
YOU WANT, BUT JUST MAKE SURE YOU

22:30.866 --> 22:31.433
WRITE IT IN THIS FONT, THAT'S

22:31.500 --> 22:32.533
CRUCIAL.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.533
NOW, MENTION ANY RELIGIOUS TEXT

22:33.600 --> 22:35.133
AND TALK ABOUT BODY, MIND,

22:35.200 --> 22:36.300
SPIRIT, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

22:36.366 --> 22:37.700
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU MENTION A

22:37.766 --> 22:39.600
HARVARD SCIENTIST HELPED CONFIRM

22:39.666 --> 22:40.400
ANCIENT WISDOM, 'CAUSE WE LOVE

22:40.466 --> 22:41.600
THOSE HEADLINES.

22:41.666 --> 22:42.700
NOW, MAKE A DIAGRAM THAT LOOKS

22:42.766 --> 22:44.300
SCIENTIFIC AND RELIGIOUS AT THE

22:44.366 --> 22:45.200
SAME TIME AND THROW SOME

22:45.266 --> 22:45.833
SANSKRIT ON THERE, DON'T WORRY

22:45.900 --> 22:46.533
ABOUT ACCURACY.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.366
BEAUTIFUL!

22:47.433 --> 22:48.566
NOW, MENTION SOME CHEMICALS.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.000
I CHOSE KANYE AND DRAKE'S NAME

22:50.066 --> 22:50.566
AND MADE THEM LOOK LIKE

22:50.633 --> 22:51.400
COMPOUNDS.

22:51.466 --> 22:52.466
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE

22:52.533 --> 22:53.233
REAL OR NOT.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.366
OUR UNCLES AND AUNTIES HAVE PhDS

22:54.433 --> 22:55.333
IN SCIENCE BUT THAT'S NO MATCH

22:55.400 --> 22:56.300
FOR WHATSAPP.

22:56.366 --> 22:57.366
NOW, IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU

22:57.433 --> 22:58.266
INSULT WESTERN MEDICINE AND

22:58.333 --> 22:59.433
CULTURE AT THIS LAST PART.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.466
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

23:00.533 --> 23:01.233
THREE DOTS, THREE EXCLAMATION

23:01.300 --> 23:02.100
POINTS, CITE YOUR SOURCES, AND

23:02.166 --> 23:03.066
MAKE THE IMAGE QUALITY A LITTLE

23:03.133 --> 23:04.466
WORSE.

23:04.533 --> 23:08.366
AND THAT IS PERFECTION.

23:08.433 --> 23:11.666
>> John: YEAH!

23:11.733 --> 23:13.400
ALL IT TAKES IS A FEW

23:13.466 --> 23:14.933
SUPERFICIAL LABELS AND STYLISH

23:15.000 --> 23:16.100
CHOICES TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT

23:16.166 --> 23:17.333
SOMETHING WITH NO REAL SUBSTANCE

23:17.400 --> 23:19.200
IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL AND GOOD

23:19.266 --> 23:20.200
OR, AS IT'S KNOWN IN AMERICA,

23:20.266 --> 23:22.766
THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.

23:22.833 --> 23:28.400
WHILE THAT WAS CLEARLY FUN, THAT

23:28.466 --> 23:30.266
GUY LATER POSTED A FOLLOWUP

23:30.333 --> 23:32.200
SAYING THAT HIS IMAGE HAD WORKED

23:32.266 --> 23:33.500
SLIGHTLY TOO WELL, BECAUSE IT

23:33.566 --> 23:34.166
WAS MAKING THE ROUNDS ON

23:34.233 --> 23:35.300
WHATSAPP, BUT NOT ALWAYS AS A

23:35.366 --> 23:37.700
JOKE.

23:37.766 --> 23:38.600
AND WE'VE SEEN THE VERY REAL

23:38.666 --> 23:39.633
IMPACTS MISINFORMATION ON THESE

23:39.700 --> 23:41.066
APPS CAN HAVE.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.600
IN INDIA, MISINFORMATION HAS

23:42.666 --> 23:43.733
BEEN LINKED TO VIOLENCE AND

23:43.800 --> 23:45.633
DEATHS, TO THE POINT WHERE

23:45.700 --> 23:46.400
WHATSAPP FELT IT NECESSARY TO

23:46.466 --> 23:48.966
CREATE THIS AD.

23:49.033 --> 23:51.833
>> MEET KAVYA.

23:51.900 --> 23:55.400
SHE LIVES AWAY FROM HER FAMILY,

23:55.466 --> 23:57.833
BUT VERY CLOSE TO THEIR HEARTS

23:57.900 --> 23:59.666
ON THE FAMILY WHATSAPP GROUP.

23:59.733 --> 24:00.766
BUT TODAY, SHE'S A LITTLE

24:00.833 --> 24:02.700
SERIOUS.

24:02.766 --> 24:04.033
FUFAJI HAS FORWARDED SOME RANDOM

24:04.100 --> 24:05.466
FAKE NEWS ON THE FAMILY GROUP.

24:05.533 --> 24:06.633
KAVYA CALLED HIM RIGHT AWAY.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.333
>> KAVYA?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.900
>> DO YOU HAVE SOME PROOF OF

24:08.966 --> 24:09.733
THAT MESSAGE OR DID YOU JUST

24:09.800 --> 24:10.466
FORWARD IT?

24:10.533 --> 24:11.066
>> I JUST RECEIVED IT ON SOME

24:11.133 --> 24:12.266
RANDOM GROUP.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.100
>> AND MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT

24:13.166 --> 24:16.000
FAKE NEWS CAN CAUSE VIOLENCE.

24:16.066 --> 24:16.533
>> WE SHOULDN'T CIRCULATE

24:16.600 --> 24:18.233
SOMETHING DANGEROUS, RIGHT?

24:18.300 --> 24:19.633
>> SHE CONVINCED FUFAJI TO LEAVE

24:19.700 --> 24:21.300
THAT GROUP.

24:21.366 --> 24:22.366
BE LIKE KAVYA.

24:22.433 --> 24:28.700
SHARE JOY, NOT RUMOURS.

24:28.766 --> 24:34.166
>> John: YEAH, YEAH, SURE,

24:34.233 --> 24:36.033
IT'S A NICE SENTIMENT, BUT IT'S

24:36.100 --> 24:36.566
NOT GREAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO

24:36.633 --> 24:37.100
PRODUCE A PSA ESSENTIALLY

24:37.166 --> 24:37.733
SAYING, "LOOK, SOME OF WHAT'S ON

24:37.800 --> 24:38.433
OUR SERVICE IS DANGEROUS

24:38.500 --> 24:39.066
NONSENSE AND IF YOU COULD HELP

24:39.133 --> 24:39.666
CLEAN IT UP FOR US, THAT'D BE

24:39.733 --> 24:40.200
GREAT!"

24:40.266 --> 24:41.000
AT THE VERY LEAST, THEY MIGHT

24:41.066 --> 24:42.100
WANT TO CHANGE THAT SLOGAN TO

24:42.166 --> 24:43.400
"SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

24:43.466 --> 24:44.433
KEEPING MISINFORMATION FROM

24:44.500 --> 24:45.333
DESTROYING THE FABRIC OF OUR

24:45.400 --> 24:45.966
SOCIETY BECAUSE WE CLEARLY CAN'T

24:46.033 --> 24:48.933
DO IT."

24:49.000 --> 24:49.900
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT ALL

24:49.966 --> 24:51.300
THIS?

24:51.366 --> 24:52.533
WELL, IDEALLY, PLATFORMS LIKE

24:52.600 --> 24:53.766
FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE AND OTHERS

24:53.833 --> 24:55.566
WOULD BE AT LEAST AS PROACTIVE

24:55.633 --> 24:56.466
ABOUT TAKING DOWN MISINFORMATION

24:56.533 --> 24:58.033
IN OTHER LANGUAGES AS THEY ARE

24:58.100 --> 24:59.800
ABOUT TAKING IT DOWN IN ENGLISH.

24:59.866 --> 25:05.233
WHICH I KNOW IS A LOW, LOW BAR,

25:05.300 --> 25:05.866
BUT IT DOES SAY SOMETHING ABOUT

25:05.933 --> 25:06.533
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.000
AS FOR PRIVATE MESSAGING APPS,

25:08.066 --> 25:08.933
THAT'S TRICKIER, BECAUSE OF HOW

25:09.000 --> 25:10.600
THEY'RE DESIGNED.

25:10.666 --> 25:11.933
AND EVEN WHEN SOME HAVE TAKEN

25:12.000 --> 25:13.266
STEPS TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF

25:13.333 --> 25:13.966
MISINFORMATION, THEY'VE OFTEN

25:14.033 --> 25:16.566
AMOUNTED TO HALF-MEASURES.

25:16.633 --> 25:17.600
WHATSAPP, FOR INSTANCE, STARTED

25:17.666 --> 25:18.966
PLACING LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF

25:19.033 --> 25:20.866
CHATS A MESSAGE CAN BE FORWARDED

25:20.933 --> 25:21.833
TO, CAPPING IT AT UP TO FIVE

25:21.900 --> 25:23.133
CHATS AT A TIME.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
WHICH MIGHT SOUND GOOD, BUT IN

25:25.266 --> 25:26.966
PRACTICE, IT LEAVES PLENTY OF

25:27.033 --> 25:28.833
ROOM FOR DAMAGE.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.400
>> IF A MESSAGE IS SENT TO A

25:31.466 --> 25:33.600
WHATSAPP GROUP OF 20, THEN EACH

25:33.666 --> 25:35.300
OF THEM SHARES IT WITH 20 OTHER

25:35.366 --> 25:39.733
PEOPLE, AND THIS HAPPENS FIVE

25:39.800 --> 25:41.266
TIMES, IT CAN REACH MORE THAN 3

25:41.333 --> 25:45.433
MILLION PEOPLE VERY QUICKLY.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.300
>> John: YEAH, IT CAN STILL

25:46.366 --> 25:48.433
SPREAD PRETTY FAR.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.500
AND I KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T THE

25:49.566 --> 25:50.766
MAIN POINT HERE, BUT ALSO HOW

25:50.833 --> 25:52.566
MANY OF US ARE IN TWO GROUP

25:52.633 --> 25:53.900
CHATS OF 20 DIFFERENT PEOPLE

25:53.966 --> 25:54.933
EACH?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.400
AND IF YOU ARE, HOW THE FUCK DO

25:56.466 --> 25:58.000
YOU SLEEP?

25:58.066 --> 25:59.433
HOW DO YOU GET ANYTHING DONE

25:59.500 --> 26:00.833
WITHOUT CONSTANTLY SWIPING AWAY

26:00.900 --> 26:02.400
NOTIFICATIONS?

26:02.466 --> 26:03.300
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING HOLD ON,

26:03.366 --> 26:04.166
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, JUST MUTE

26:04.233 --> 26:06.133
THEM, THEN HOW DO YOU THEN CATCH

26:06.200 --> 26:07.100
UP ON ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

26:07.166 --> 26:08.333
IN THE CHAT?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.300
YOU'D SPEND HALF YOUR DAY

26:10.366 --> 26:11.566
SCROLLING BACK UP JUST SO YOU'D

26:11.633 --> 26:12.133
KNOW WHAT THIS GIF MEANT IN

26:12.200 --> 26:13.566
CONTEXT.

26:13.633 --> 26:15.233
MOM SENT THAT?

26:15.300 --> 26:16.933
IN RESPONSE TO WHAT?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.633
I HAVE TO KNOW.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.233
A KEY PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT

26:21.300 --> 26:22.566
MANY COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THE

26:22.633 --> 26:23.733
SAME FACT-CHECKING RESOURCES

26:23.800 --> 26:25.633
THAT ENGLISH-SPEAKING ONES DO.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.666
IF SOMEONE SENDS YOU AN ALEX

26:27.733 --> 26:28.933
JONES CLIP, YOU CAN RESPOND TO

26:29.000 --> 26:30.800
IT WITH ANY NUMBER OF TRUSTED

26:30.866 --> 26:31.900
SOURCES DEBUNKING HIM.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.166
YOU CAN SEND THEM SOMETHING FROM

26:33.233 --> 26:35.100
POLITIFACT, OR SNOPES, OR

26:35.166 --> 26:37.100
FACTCHECK.ORG.

26:37.166 --> 26:37.833
BUT IF SOMEONE SENDS YOU A CLIP

26:37.900 --> 26:39.633
FROM KING RADIO,

26:39.700 --> 26:40.333
VIETNAMESE-LANGUAGE

26:40.400 --> 26:42.966
FACT-CHECKING SOURCES ARE THIN

26:43.033 --> 26:44.000
ON THE GROUND.

26:44.066 --> 26:45.000
THERE ARE SOME -- THERE'S VIET

26:45.066 --> 26:45.966
FACT CHECK, A VOLUNTEER-LED

26:46.033 --> 26:47.900
PROJECT, AND THE INTERPRETER,

26:47.966 --> 26:49.300
WHICH WORKS TO TRANSLATE NEWS

26:49.366 --> 26:50.533
ARTICLES FROM REPUTABLE OUTLETS

26:50.600 --> 26:52.633
INTO VIETNAMESE.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.533
BUT THESE ARE OFTEN SMALL

26:54.600 --> 27:03.400
ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE PEOPLE

27:03.466 --> 27:04.033
RUNNING THEM ARE OUTMATCHED AND

27:04.100 --> 27:04.500
UNDERSTANDABLY FUCKING

27:04.566 --> 27:04.766
EXHAUSTED.

27:04.833 --> 27:05.300
SO GROUPS LIKE THESE NEED

27:05.366 --> 27:05.900
RESOURCES TO BETTER MATCH THE

27:05.966 --> 27:06.433
CHALLENGE THEY'RE FACING.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.200
BUT BEYOND THAT, THERE NEEDS TO

27:07.266 --> 27:08.600
BE PUBLIC PRESSURE ON PLATFORMS

27:08.666 --> 27:09.900
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ALL FORMS

27:09.966 --> 27:11.766
OF MISINFORMATION, WHETHER

27:11.833 --> 27:13.300
