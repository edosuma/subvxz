06:29.875 --> 06:32.709
- That doesn't say,

06:29.875 --> 06:32.709
"The Parent Cafe."

06:32.750 --> 06:37.125
- It says,

06:32.750 --> 06:37.125
"The Parent-Free Cafe."

06:37.166 --> 06:40.000
- Guys, we've been watching you

06:37.166 --> 06:40.000
for the last two hours,

06:40.041 --> 06:43.375
and The Parent-Free Cafe

06:40.041 --> 06:43.375
is also customer-free.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.333
- Clearly, you need us.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.542
- all: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.500
- Let us also remind you

06:47.583 --> 06:49.500
of our research.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.667
And I quote...

06:49.542 --> 06:51.667
- And he quotes.

06:51.709 --> 06:53.625
- "Your parents are always

06:51.709 --> 06:53.625
getting in our biz."

06:53.667 --> 06:56.333
- End quote.

06:53.667 --> 06:56.333
- The quote is over.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.834
- Uh, guys, in the future,

06:56.375 --> 06:59.834
I'd like to do my own quotes.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.959
- He'd like to do

06:59.875 --> 07:01.959
his own quotes.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.834
- Okay, well, clearly

07:02.000 --> 07:03.834
this isn't working.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.875
I mean, even your friends

07:03.875 --> 07:05.875
aren't here.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.834
- Yes, they are.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.834
Oh, here they come now.

07:11.667 --> 07:13.750
- And there they go.

07:13.792 --> 07:16.417
- Uh, would you excuse us

07:13.792 --> 07:16.417
for one second?

07:16.458 --> 07:18.208
Uh, what are you guys doing?

07:18.250 --> 07:20.333
- Yeah, we made our place

07:18.250 --> 07:20.333
parent-free.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.917
- Yeah, we got buttons.

07:22.959 --> 07:25.250
- Why are you still in line

07:22.959 --> 07:25.250
for Captain Felde?

07:25.291 --> 07:28.291
- We're not. This is a new line

07:25.291 --> 07:28.291
for Pippin's Paninis.

07:28.333 --> 07:29.917
- Gourmet Guy just gave

07:28.333 --> 07:29.917
four "oh, my's"

07:29.959 --> 07:32.041
to their weenie panini.

07:29.959 --> 07:32.041
- [chuckles]

07:32.083 --> 07:33.625
He said weenie.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.917
- They put a hot dog

07:33.667 --> 07:35.917
inside a panini.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.000
- [chuckles]

07:35.959 --> 07:38.000
She said panini.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.375
- Sorry.

07:40.417 --> 07:42.250
- Okay, all right.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.375
At least we know we need more

07:42.291 --> 07:44.375
than just no parents.

07:44.417 --> 07:47.000
- Yeah.

07:44.417 --> 07:47.000
- Wait a minute.

07:47.041 --> 07:50.250
We need our own burgerito

07:47.041 --> 07:50.250
or weenie panini.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.583
- Yeah, we can each come up

07:50.291 --> 07:52.583
with a food combo,

07:52.625 --> 07:54.375
then we'll pick the best,

07:52.625 --> 07:54.375
and call Gourmet Guy

07:54.417 --> 07:55.875
to come review it.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.875
- Yeah.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.208
- Wait, you can't just call

07:55.917 --> 07:57.208
Gourmet Guy.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.542
He doesn't give out his number

07:57.250 --> 07:59.542
willy-nilly.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.000
- [chuckles]

07:59.583 --> 08:01.000
"Willy-nilly."

08:01.041 --> 08:02.750
- Fine.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.750
We won't call him.

08:02.792 --> 08:06.291
We'll e-mail him

08:02.792 --> 08:06.291
until he agrees.

08:06.333 --> 08:09.250
- In the meantime, we've got

08:06.333 --> 08:09.250
two customers at our cafe.

08:15.792 --> 08:19.375
- Look down at your button,

08:15.792 --> 08:19.375
Dicky.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.041
- Oh.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.041
[chuckles]

08:21.083 --> 08:24.208
You said button.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.208
[laughing]

08:24.250 --> 08:25.333
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

08:25.375 --> 08:27.542
<i>- [whistling]</i>

08:29.000 --> 08:30.625
- Why does she keep throwing

08:29.000 --> 08:30.625
this thing away?

08:30.667 --> 08:33.917
This could have

08:30.667 --> 08:33.917
some great suggestions in it.

08:33.959 --> 08:36.500
"The owner should lose

08:33.959 --> 08:36.500
that awful toupee.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.500
He's not fooling anyone."

08:38.542 --> 08:40.250
Huh?

08:40.291 --> 08:41.834
Huh?

08:41.875 --> 08:43.792
- Ah.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.792
[chuckles]

08:51.291 --> 08:53.000
- I thought that toupee

08:51.291 --> 08:53.000
looked great, Squish.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.583
I mean, why would someone--

08:55.625 --> 08:58.542
This is Anne's handwriting.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.583
These are all Anne's.

09:00.625 --> 09:02.000
[exhales sharply]

09:02.041 --> 09:05.000
I do not do

09:02.041 --> 09:05.000
little girl push-ups.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.458
[dog sneezes]

09:06.500 --> 09:08.375
Really?

09:08.417 --> 09:10.583
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

09:10.625 --> 09:12.083
- Thanks for being here, Mae,

09:12.125 --> 09:14.625
to help us decide whose

09:12.125 --> 09:14.625
fun food combo is the best.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.542
- Are you sure you need me

09:14.667 --> 09:16.542
to do this?

09:16.583 --> 09:20.917
- Yeah.

09:16.583 --> 09:20.917
We need an impartial judge.

09:20.959 --> 09:22.875
- [blows kiss]

09:25.000 --> 09:28.333
- Uh...pass.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.834
- Well, I guess we'll have to

09:30.417 --> 09:32.834
do it ourselves.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.667
I'll start.

09:34.709 --> 09:39.291
I stuffed a pita

09:34.709 --> 09:39.291
with a fajita.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.000
The fapita.

09:41.041 --> 09:42.417
Deal with it.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.458
[lid clangs]

09:44.500 --> 09:47.000
- Ah, impressive,

09:44.500 --> 09:47.000
but I see your fapita,

09:47.041 --> 09:50.583
and I raise you a waffle

09:47.041 --> 09:50.583
with falafel in it.

09:50.625 --> 09:53.709
The waffle-falafel.

09:50.625 --> 09:53.709
Deal with that.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.000
[lid clangs]

09:55.041 --> 09:57.750
- Oh, nice try,

09:57.792 --> 10:01.875
but meet...the pizza-dilla.

10:01.917 --> 10:07.166
Two slices of pizza slapped

10:01.917 --> 10:07.166
together to make a quesa-dilla.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.750
Boom.

10:09.792 --> 10:12.166
- It's pronounced "quesadilla,"

10:12.208 --> 10:15.458
so it would be

10:12.208 --> 10:15.458
the pizzadilla.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.083
- I'll say it how I want.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.083
It's my i-dilla.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.750
[lid crashes]

10:19.125 --> 10:21.750
- Ow!

10:21.792 --> 10:23.583
- Okay, no more lid dropping.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.417
Nicky, what have you got?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.792
- Drum roll, please.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.291
- Ooh, what is that?

10:28.333 --> 10:30.208
A drumstick inside

10:28.333 --> 10:30.208
a dinner roll?

10:30.250 --> 10:31.959
- No,

10:30.250 --> 10:31.959
I'm asking for a drum roll.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.917
- Me too.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.917
It sounds delicious.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.750
- Ha.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.750
The kabob gobbler.

10:38.792 --> 10:40.667
Turkey and all the fixings.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.959
It's Thanksgiving on a stick.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.959
Boom.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.625
I'd drop this, but I respect

10:44.000 --> 10:48.625
my cookware too much.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.125
- All right, let's vote.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.709
- Vote?

10:50.166 --> 10:51.709
[scoffs]

10:51.750 --> 10:53.542
Please.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.542
As the closest thing

10:53.583 --> 10:55.667
to a chef here,

10:53.583 --> 10:55.667
I know what's best,

10:55.709 --> 10:57.083
and it's the kabob gobbler.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.000
- Uh, it's clearly

10:57.125 --> 10:59.000
the fapita.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.875
- Uh, waffle-falafel.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.041
- Pizza-dilla.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.041
- "Dilla."

11:03.083 --> 11:04.750
- Best meal of the year

11:03.083 --> 11:04.750
on a stick.

11:04.792 --> 11:08.667
[all yelling at once]

11:08.709 --> 11:11.709
- Guys, guys, Gourmet Guy

11:08.709 --> 11:11.709
just e-mailed us back.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.583
- [gasps]

11:11.750 --> 11:13.583
- He's coming tomorrow.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.250
So if we really want to save

11:13.625 --> 11:15.250
the cafe,

11:15.291 --> 11:16.667
we have to get

11:15.291 --> 11:16.667
a good review.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.709
So let's hit him

11:16.709 --> 11:18.709
with our best:

11:18.750 --> 11:20.834
the kabob gobbler.

11:20.875 --> 11:24.583
- Nicky, none of us want Mom and

11:20.875 --> 11:24.583
Dad to shut down the cafe,

11:24.625 --> 11:26.417
but we all have to agree.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.709
- But since we can't,

11:26.458 --> 11:28.709
what are we gonna do?

11:30.583 --> 11:34.250
- I give you the kabob gobbler

11:30.583 --> 11:34.250
Waffle-Falafel

11:34.291 --> 11:35.917
Fapita Pizza-dilla.

11:35.959 --> 11:37.709
- "Dilla."

11:35.959 --> 11:37.709
- Let it go.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.959
- Nicky, as the closest thing

11:37.750 --> 11:39.959
we have to a chef,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.208
what do you think?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.208
- [scoffs]

11:42.250 --> 11:45.208
What do I think?

11:45.250 --> 11:47.959
I think it lacks focus.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.542
I think it's a mish mosh of

11:48.000 --> 11:51.542
11 different foods on a stick.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.625
I think it's

11:51.583 --> 11:54.625
a culinary abomination.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.709
- That's a good name.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.250
And here's a better one.

11:59.291 --> 12:03.291
The Food Bat.

11:59.291 --> 12:03.291
[whooshes]

12:03.333 --> 12:07.000
- You know what?

12:03.333 --> 12:07.000
That is a home run.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.792
Hey, check it out.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.792
- [gasps]

12:09.834 --> 12:11.291
- That's gotta be Gourmet Guy.

12:11.333 --> 12:14.000
- Okay, guys,

12:11.333 --> 12:14.000
it's show time.

12:16.166 --> 12:17.959
- Table for one, sir?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.917
- That'd be lovely.

12:22.750 --> 12:26.792
- Might I recommend

12:22.750 --> 12:26.792
our signature dish...

12:26.834 --> 12:29.667
the Food Bat.

12:29.709 --> 12:31.166
- Oh, my.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.291
- [gasps]

12:31.208 --> 12:32.291
That's one "oh, my,"

12:32.333 --> 12:35.250
and he hasn't even tasted it.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.667
- Oh, my.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.667
- That's two.

12:38.709 --> 12:41.458
- Yes!

12:38.709 --> 12:41.458
- That's two.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.083
- [chuckles]

12:42.792 --> 12:45.083
Oh, my!

12:45.125 --> 12:47.458
- Three!

12:48.959 --> 12:51.333
- Oh...

12:51.375 --> 12:54.792
my.

12:51.375 --> 12:54.792
- Yes! That's four "oh, my's."

12:54.834 --> 12:56.834
- Oh, he's so gonna give us

12:54.834 --> 12:56.834
a rave review.

12:56.875 --> 13:00.083
- Whoa!

12:56.875 --> 13:00.083
- Mmm.

13:00.125 --> 13:01.291
all: "Meh"?

13:01.333 --> 13:03.792
- How could he give us

13:01.333 --> 13:03.792
a "meh"?

13:03.834 --> 13:06.458
- Maybe we should have

13:03.834 --> 13:06.458
set it on fire.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.959
- Dicky, that "meh" could cost

13:06.500 --> 13:09.959
us the cafe.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.583
- You know, I don't get it.

13:11.625 --> 13:16.250
We all heard Gourmet Guy say,

13:11.625 --> 13:16.250
"Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my,

13:16.291 --> 13:20.792
Oh...my."

13:20.834 --> 13:24.750
Unless...

13:20.834 --> 13:24.750
that wasn't Gourmet Guy.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.917
- But he's the only person

13:24.792 --> 13:26.917
we served.

13:26.959 --> 13:30.792
Who else could it

13:26.959 --> 13:30.792
have been?

13:30.834 --> 13:32.750
- Meh.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
What?

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
It...needs salt.

13:43.041 --> 13:45.083
I think there's some...

13:45.125 --> 13:48.500
not in here.

13:48.542 --> 13:51.083
- Um, Nicky,

13:48.542 --> 13:51.083
did you just say, "meh"?

13:51.125 --> 13:54.542
- Uh, no, I said, uh,

13:51.125 --> 13:54.542
I said, "Mae."

13:54.583 --> 13:56.041
- Pretty sure it was "meh."

13:56.083 --> 13:57.709
- Well, I'm telling you

13:56.083 --> 13:57.709
it was "Mae."

13:57.750 --> 14:01.625
- Why would you say "Mae"?

13:57.750 --> 14:01.625
She's not even here.

14:01.667 --> 14:06.667
- You're right.

14:01.667 --> 14:06.667
I-I said, "guacmaemole."

14:06.709 --> 14:08.792
- Nobody says that.

14:08.834 --> 14:12.875
- Oh, yes, then it must have

14:08.834 --> 14:12.875
been, uh, "guacamolmae."

14:12.917 --> 14:16.208
- No one says that either.

14:16.250 --> 14:21.792
- Oh, uh, then I meant to say,

14:16.250 --> 14:21.792
uh, "guacmaemolmae."

14:21.834 --> 14:24.625
Everybody says that.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.792
- Is there something

14:24.667 --> 14:26.792
you want to tell us, Nicky?

14:26.834 --> 14:30.375
- I mean, noth--nothing

14:26.834 --> 14:30.375
really comes to mind.

14:30.417 --> 14:32.667
Fresh "guacmaemolmae"?

14:32.709 --> 14:34.875
- Admit it,

14:32.709 --> 14:34.875
you're Gourmet Guy.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.500
- What?

14:34.917 --> 14:36.500
No.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.667
- Admit it!

14:37.709 --> 14:42.125
- Uh, no.

14:37.709 --> 14:42.125
- Admit it!

14:42.166 --> 14:44.709
- Okay, fine.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.709
I'm Gourmet Guy.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.291
You happy?

14:46.333 --> 14:47.667
- Yeah.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.709
- What--hey, hey!

14:49.750 --> 14:51.834
Ah!

14:51.875 --> 14:54.792
This is exactly why Gourmet Guy

14:51.875 --> 14:54.792
likes to remain anonymous.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.000
<i>♪</i>

15:01.041 --> 15:02.834
- What were you thinking,

15:01.041 --> 15:02.834
Nicky?

15:02.875 --> 15:04.625
This could ruin everything

15:02.875 --> 15:04.625
we've worked for.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.333
How could you give us

15:04.667 --> 15:06.333
a bad review?

15:06.375 --> 15:10.333
- Because...as Gourmet Guy,

15:06.375 --> 15:10.333
I have a responsibility

15:10.375 --> 15:11.917
to give my readers

15:10.375 --> 15:11.917
the truth.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.583
- Yeah,

15:11.959 --> 15:13.583
and as our brother,

15:13.625 --> 15:15.959
you also have a responsibility

15:13.625 --> 15:15.959
to us.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.709
- I bet he's just mad

15:16.000 --> 15:17.709
'cause we wouldn't

15:17.750 --> 15:18.959
feature his kabob gobbler.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.583
- That's not why I posted it.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.625
No matter how mad

15:20.625 --> 15:22.625
I was as Nicky,

15:22.667 --> 15:25.917
as Gourmet Guy, I gave

15:22.667 --> 15:25.917
my completely honest opinion.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.458
- I'm calling a quaddle.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.375
Minus Gourmet Guy.

15:31.417 --> 15:32.834
- Is Nicky still invited?

15:32.875 --> 15:34.417
- No!

15:32.875 --> 15:34.417
Nicky sits there

15:34.458 --> 15:37.542
and thinks about

15:34.458 --> 15:37.542
what Gourmet Guy did.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.709
- All right,

15:41.291 --> 15:43.709
what do we do?

15:43.750 --> 15:45.542
- I say we kick him out

15:43.750 --> 15:45.542
of the quads.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.417
From now on, we'll just be

15:45.583 --> 15:48.417
the Three Quads.

15:48.458 --> 15:51.125
- We can't be the Three Quads,

15:48.458 --> 15:51.125
Dicky. Quads means four.

15:51.166 --> 15:54.792
- Yeah, just like dilla

15:51.166 --> 15:54.792
is pronounced "deya."

15:54.834 --> 15:56.625
- All right, I've got it.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.667
We'll have Gourmet Guy

15:56.667 --> 15:58.667
review us again,

15:58.709 --> 16:01.500
but this time we'll just serve

15:58.709 --> 16:01.500
him Nicky's kabob gobbler.

16:01.542 --> 16:05.208
- Perfect. He's sure to give

16:01.542 --> 16:05.208
himself four "oh, my's."

16:05.250 --> 16:07.583
- Okay, here's how this

16:05.250 --> 16:07.583
is gonna go down.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.375
- Guys,

16:07.625 --> 16:09.375
I heard the whole thing.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.583
You're three feet away.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.000
- So, you'll do it,

16:11.625 --> 16:13.000
right?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.625
- Absolutely.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.792
Nicky looks forward to cooking

16:14.667 --> 16:16.792
the kabob gobbler,

16:16.834 --> 16:19.000
and Gourmet Guy looks forward

16:16.834 --> 16:19.000
to reviewing it.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.542
- I'm not sure which one of you

16:19.041 --> 16:21.542
I'm talking to,

16:21.583 --> 16:24.458
but whoever it is,

16:21.583 --> 16:24.458
tell the other one he's weird.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.709
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

16:28.750 --> 16:30.500
- Hey, Tom,

16:28.750 --> 16:30.500
do you have the receipt

16:30.542 --> 16:31.834
for that tube sock order?

16:31.875 --> 16:35.834
- No, but I do have this.

16:35.875 --> 16:39.500
- Ugh.

16:35.875 --> 16:39.500
Did you have to part it, Tom?

16:39.542 --> 16:41.583
- Have to?

16:39.542 --> 16:41.583
No.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.583
This is your punishment.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.333
- Come on, honey.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.625
I wrote those thing, like,

16:46.375 --> 16:48.625
right after the kids were born.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.083
I was on no sleep and clearly

16:48.667 --> 16:51.083
not thinking straight.

16:51.125 --> 16:52.542
So please just--just hand over

16:51.125 --> 16:52.542
the box.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.750
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.750
- What?

16:53.792 --> 16:55.125
- I want to read

16:53.792 --> 16:55.125
the rest of them.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.625
I'm sure there's a few in here

16:55.166 --> 16:56.625
about my mother.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.709
- Honey, you are wrong.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.583
There's more than a few.

17:01.625 --> 17:04.834
- Have you decided on what

17:01.625 --> 17:04.834
you'll be having yet, sir?

17:04.875 --> 17:08.792
- Let's see, let's see,

17:04.875 --> 17:08.792
let's see.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.667
Do you have any bisque?

17:10.709 --> 17:12.625
- We do not.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.834
- Might I suggest

17:12.667 --> 17:14.834
the kabob gobbler.

17:14.875 --> 17:20.250
The only thing on the menu.

17:20.291 --> 17:23.041
- Okay, so that's one

17:20.291 --> 17:23.041
kabob gobbler.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.041
- Would you like that

17:23.083 --> 17:25.041
set on fire?

17:25.083 --> 17:26.625
- How does the chef

17:25.083 --> 17:26.625
recommend it?

17:26.667 --> 17:29.375
- Not set on fire.

17:29.417 --> 17:33.750
- One kabob gobbler

17:29.417 --> 17:33.750
"not set on fire."

17:37.583 --> 17:40.834
- Oh, my.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.834
- One!

17:42.709 --> 17:45.834
- Oh, my.

17:42.709 --> 17:45.834
- Yes! Two!

17:47.417 --> 17:49.083
- Oh, my.

17:53.041 --> 17:54.667
Oh.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.041
- all: "Meh?"

17:56.083 --> 17:57.875
- Yeah, did you guys call me?

17:57.917 --> 17:59.834
- We weren't talking to you,

17:57.917 --> 17:59.834
Mae.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.667
How could you give us

17:59.875 --> 18:02.667
another "meh?"

18:02.709 --> 18:04.041
- I don't get it, Nicky.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.500
We heard you say "oh, my"

18:04.083 --> 18:07.500
four times.

18:07.542 --> 18:10.291
- I said it,

18:07.542 --> 18:10.291
but I just couldn't write it.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.542
- Why not?

18:11.583 --> 18:14.417
The kabob gobbler was

18:11.583 --> 18:14.417
your creation.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.041
- I'm sorry.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.792
The critic in me has to be

18:16.083 --> 18:18.792
honest with the chef in me.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.583
And the chef in me stinks.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.000
- What are you talking about?

18:22.041 --> 18:24.500
We all tasted it,

18:22.041 --> 18:24.500
and it was delicious.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.583
- I can't come back

18:24.542 --> 18:26.583
from a review like this.

18:26.625 --> 18:29.542
- But Gourmet Guy said,

18:26.625 --> 18:29.542
"The chef shows promise."

18:29.583 --> 18:31.458
- Well, what does he know?

18:29.583 --> 18:31.458
- He's you.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.208
- What do I know?

18:31.500 --> 18:34.208
- Then don't post it.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.959
- I have to.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.959
I have a deadline.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.583
- Well, call the editor

18:36.000 --> 18:37.583
and tell him

18:37.625 --> 18:40.500
you're not going to make it.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.500
- I am also the editor.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.583
- Look, you can't post

18:40.542 --> 18:42.583
that review.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.041
It'll ruin the cafe,

18:44.083 --> 18:46.542
and Mom and Dad

18:44.083 --> 18:46.542
will definitely close it down.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.750
- Hey!

18:46.583 --> 18:47.750
- Let go!

18:47.792 --> 18:49.792
- You let go!

18:49.834 --> 18:51.000
- [grunts]

18:49.834 --> 18:51.000
It's three against one.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.834
You'll never win.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.834
- Wrong.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.583
It's three against five.

18:54.625 --> 18:58.750
I'm Gourmet Guy, Chef Nicky,

18:54.625 --> 18:58.750
Editor Nicky, and regular Nicky.

18:58.792 --> 19:00.750
- That's four.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.750
- Oh.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.750
And also Kicky.

19:02.792 --> 19:07.041
all: Who?

19:02.792 --> 19:07.041
Ow!

19:07.083 --> 19:09.041
- I wouldn't do that

19:07.083 --> 19:09.041
if I were you.

19:09.083 --> 19:12.750
- Step away from the laptop.

19:12.792 --> 19:15.417
- All of you.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.375
- Oh, yeah?

19:15.458 --> 19:18.375
Who's gonna make me?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.041
- Is that a food fight?

19:21.083 --> 19:22.333
This place is picking up.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.667
- It's not fire,

19:22.375 --> 19:24.667
but I'm in.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.959
- Food fight!

19:27.000 --> 19:30.458
- [blowing whistle]

19:30.500 --> 19:33.959
Everybody, stop!

19:30.500 --> 19:33.959
What's wrong with you?

19:34.000 --> 19:37.125
This isn't a fair food fight.

19:37.166 --> 19:41.625
Now it's fair.

19:37.166 --> 19:41.625
Kabobs away.

20:05.208 --> 20:08.542
Stop!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.709
Ahh!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.709
- Ow.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.417
- Ow!

20:11.750 --> 20:13.417
It totally hurts.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.750
- I thought you wanted

20:13.458 --> 20:15.750
to save the cafe,

20:15.792 --> 20:17.375
not destroy it!

20:17.417 --> 20:20.291
- Sorry, but we found out

20:17.417 --> 20:20.291
Nicky's the Gourmet Guy.

20:20.333 --> 20:21.709
[all gasping]

20:21.750 --> 20:24.125
- And he was gonna post a bad

20:21.750 --> 20:24.125
review about our cafe.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.875
[all gasping]

20:24.166 --> 20:25.875
- Nicky, how could you give us

20:25.917 --> 20:28.959
a bad review?

20:25.917 --> 20:28.959
- [gasps]

20:29.000 --> 20:31.291
Oh, we're done with that?

20:31.333 --> 20:34.875
- I'm sorry.

20:31.333 --> 20:34.875
I just can't lie to my readers.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.625
- We're sorry about all this.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.959
We just really don't want

20:36.667 --> 20:38.959
the cafe to close down.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.166
- Well, we have some news

20:41.208 --> 20:42.792
and we think

20:41.208 --> 20:42.792
you're gonna like it.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.667
- We decided to keep it open.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.625
- Yes!

20:44.709 --> 20:46.625
- You did?

20:46.667 --> 20:49.000
- We saw how much hard work

20:46.667 --> 20:49.000
you guys put into saving it,

20:49.041 --> 20:50.834
and we realized how much

20:49.041 --> 20:50.834
you care about it.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.083
- Plus, our accountant told us

20:50.875 --> 20:53.083
it would be a financial disaster

20:53.125 --> 20:54.583
to close it, so...[chuckles]

20:53.125 --> 20:54.583
- Yeah.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.875
- [chuckles]

20:54.625 --> 20:56.875
Is Nicky your accountant, too?

20:56.917 --> 20:59.667
- No.

20:56.917 --> 20:59.667
He is.

20:59.709 --> 21:02.250
- Oh, hi.

21:02.291 --> 21:04.333
- Okay, let's get this cafe

21:02.291 --> 21:04.333
cleaned up

21:04.375 --> 21:06.417
and back open for business.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.417
[all agreeing]

21:06.458 --> 21:08.875
- Uh, is that smoke?

21:08.917 --> 21:10.625
- Well, that's weird.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.709
I preheated the oven,

21:10.667 --> 21:12.709
but I didn't put anything in it.

21:12.750 --> 21:16.000
[all panicking]

21:16.041 --> 21:18.750
- Hey, at least something

21:16.041 --> 21:18.750
got set on fire.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.959
- Run, people!

21:21.000 --> 21:23.250
Forget the dinner rolls,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.250
Grandma!

21:25.333 --> 21:28.000
- Ah!

21:28.041 --> 21:29.417
- Yes!

21:28.041 --> 21:29.417

21:34.125 --> 21:36.875

21:34.125 --> 21:36.875
started in the oven.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.750
Found this in there.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.834
- "Suggestion box."

21:40.875 --> 21:42.333
- Oops.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.333
[chuckles]

21:42.375 --> 21:44.291
Guess that wasn't

21:42.375 --> 21:44.291
the best hiding place.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.291
- Good news.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.291
We were also able to save this.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.625
- Ugh.

21:47.667 --> 21:50.250
- Thank you, Fireman Handsome--

21:47.667 --> 21:50.250
I mean, Hanson.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.625
That's what she calls you.

21:51.667 --> 21:53.834
- Just one time.

21:58.291 --> 22:01.417
- So, how much will it cost

21:58.291 --> 22:01.417
to rebuild the cafe?

22:01.458 --> 22:03.125
- Well...
