WEBVTT

00:00.683 --> 00:02.984
(music playing)

00:28.334 --> 00:29.268
You want
some champagne?

00:29.334 --> 00:30.467
I'd love some champagne,

00:30.533 --> 00:32.067
but I didn't see any
at the bar.

00:32.134 --> 00:33.567
This must be your
first Mr. Ice party.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.800
It wouldn't be at the bar.

00:34.867 --> 00:35.934
What?

00:37.500 --> 00:38.767
Beautiful day,

00:38.834 --> 00:40.101
and the only way
to stay cool is--

00:40.167 --> 00:42.001
How you doin', mama?--
plenty of ice.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.634
Hi. There she is.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.101
Mm, thank you.

00:49.467 --> 00:50.700
Want to get a room?

00:50.767 --> 00:55.067
Hello? I don't even
know your name.

00:55.134 --> 00:56.734
I know yours.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.433
Who doesn't?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.467
Yeah, I made her the baby
version of the bling.

01:09.533 --> 01:10.901
That reminds me.

01:10.967 --> 01:12.800
I think we're gonna
have to change that up.

01:12.867 --> 01:14.767
A little more diamonds.

01:14.834 --> 01:18.368
(indistinct conversations)

01:23.368 --> 01:25.767
OMG.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.334
You could use a glass,
but, uh...

01:27.400 --> 01:29.334
No way.

01:36.268 --> 01:40.400
Hey, Mr. Ice,
you're the man.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.734
(gunshot)

01:59.734 --> 02:03.067
(gunshots and screaming)

02:04.368 --> 02:05.368
MAN:
Back up!
Back up!

02:05.433 --> 02:08.600
(people shouting)

02:12.001 --> 02:13.567
Give me your jewelry!
Take off your
jewelry!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.001
(gunshot, screaming)

02:15.067 --> 02:16.700
I said give me all your stuff!
Give me everything!

02:16.767 --> 02:18.867
Take off your jewelry!

02:18.934 --> 02:20.001
(gunshots)

02:20.067 --> 02:22.433
This is no game!
Take it off! Now!

02:22.500 --> 02:24.901
You think I'm
playing with you?

02:26.634 --> 02:28.101
Wow! Dakota Hudson.

02:28.167 --> 02:29.934
Give me all your jewelry!

02:30.001 --> 02:31.934
Give me the rocks.
Get 'em right now.
You can have 'em.

02:32.001 --> 02:34.368
Take everything off right now.
You are moving too slow.

02:34.433 --> 02:35.667
(gunshot, groan)

02:35.734 --> 02:38.734
Hey, man, we got
to get out of here!

02:38.800 --> 02:39.901
(man shouting)

02:39.967 --> 02:41.268
Move out!

02:41.334 --> 02:43.268
Everybody stay...
stay down!

02:43.334 --> 02:44.700
(gunshots)

02:44.767 --> 02:47.467
Let's move,
let's go. Come on!

02:47.533 --> 02:48.767
(crying):
Oh, my God!

02:48.834 --> 02:50.533
(gunshots continue)

02:50.600 --> 02:53.500
Somebody help me!
He's been shot!

02:53.567 --> 02:55.567
(tires squealing)

02:55.634 --> 02:58.101
(sirens wailing)

02:58.167 --> 03:01.101
MAN (over radio):
We have an armed robbery
in progress.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.268
Shots fired.

03:02.334 --> 03:04.334
Possible homicide.

03:09.368 --> 03:12.767
TRIPP:
Party was held by one Mr. Ice.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.700
The real name is,
uh, Bernard Hegland.

03:14.767 --> 03:16.901
They call him "Jeweler
to the A-list."

03:16.967 --> 03:19.001
Dispatch said
two gunmen, Frank.

03:19.067 --> 03:21.567
Yeah. One fatality--
gunshot wound.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.500
Ethan Parker. Sugar.

03:23.567 --> 03:26.001
Family goes back in Florida
five generations.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.400
The family history ends here.

03:27.467 --> 03:28.934
Yeah.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.667
Unsubstantiated witness said
that, uh, one of the guys

03:31.734 --> 03:33.301
dropped a
nylon mask.
(woman shrieks)

03:37.467 --> 03:39.967
What do we got?

03:42.034 --> 03:44.034
MAN:
Oh, my God, it's Dakota.

03:45.301 --> 03:47.734
WOMAN:
Oh, my God!
Oh, it's Dakota.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.234
We got a second
fatality, Frank.

03:50.301 --> 03:52.700
These bums get away
with diamond trinkets.

03:52.767 --> 03:55.700
But they're not going
to get away with murder.

04:42.601 --> 04:44.967
(garbled radio transmission)

05:22.617 --> 05:25.184
You want me to put
a dollar value on it?

05:25.251 --> 05:27.284
You put a dollar value
on your kids?

05:27.351 --> 05:28.884
I handcrafted every piece
of jewelry

05:28.950 --> 05:30.084
my clients were wearing.

05:30.151 --> 05:31.251
Okay, ballpark.

05:31.317 --> 05:32.550
Under or over
a million?

05:32.617 --> 05:34.750
You're clowning, right?

05:34.817 --> 05:36.384
Try $30 million.

05:36.451 --> 05:39.583
$30 million
in fancied-up keychains?

05:39.650 --> 05:43.817
You got to understand quality,
shape, heft, clarity.

05:43.884 --> 05:46.217
Nobody hits the red carpet
without my stuff.

05:46.284 --> 05:48.817
Well, I can think of two people
that won't make that appearance.

05:48.884 --> 05:50.917
Now, I need a detailed description

05:50.984 --> 05:52.650
of the jewelry
your clients were wearing.

05:52.717 --> 05:55.217
I'll give you the sales list,
not the designs.

05:55.284 --> 05:56.817
Those are trademarked.

05:56.884 --> 05:58.984
Okay, fine, Edison,
but I need 'em by yesterday.

06:02.967 --> 06:05.167
You get a list
of stolen merchandise, Frank?

06:05.234 --> 06:06.567
TRIPP:
Ice is compiling it.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.601
Should help us
track down our thieves.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.100
Okay, we hit
the pawnshops

06:10.167 --> 06:12.033
and the metal exchanges.
We do it right now.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.033
Yeah, before they unload it
and disappear in the Bahamas.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.467
Keep me posted.

06:15.534 --> 06:17.534
Hey.

06:17.601 --> 06:19.467
Gunshot to the chest.

06:19.534 --> 06:20.601
Still wearing his bling.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.434
Well, he didn't want

06:22.501 --> 06:23.501
to give up his jewelry,

06:23.567 --> 06:26.467
so he gave
up his life.

06:26.534 --> 06:27.801
-Help me out, Ryan, please?
-Yeah.

06:27.868 --> 06:29.868
(grunts)

06:31.683 --> 06:33.284
(camera shutter clicking)

06:33.751 --> 06:35.217
What was Dakota Hudson famous
for, anyway?

06:35.284 --> 06:38.350
Lip-syncing,
club openings,

06:38.417 --> 06:40.884
red carpet events.

06:40.950 --> 06:42.284
Oh, she was in the video

06:42.350 --> 06:44.117
for that Australian band
that was from England.

06:44.184 --> 06:46.451
Oh, basically,
she had no talent.

06:46.517 --> 06:49.050
I guess she had talent
for being a star.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.751
Doesn't make sense.

06:50.818 --> 06:52.217
Tell me about it.

06:52.284 --> 06:56.117
No, she has a-a gunshot wound
on her chest.

06:56.184 --> 06:59.884
Tommy Lee wannabe over there
said she gave up her jewelry.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.717
Means they had no reason
for killing her.

07:02.784 --> 07:04.717
Or they had a reason
we didn't know about.

07:04.784 --> 07:05.884
WOLFE:
Hey!

07:05.950 --> 07:06.950
WOLFE (whistles):
Hey!

07:07.017 --> 07:08.918
Put that down.

07:08.983 --> 07:10.818
Hey, look-- I think
I found something big.

07:10.884 --> 07:11.983
Do me a favor.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.451
Put it down.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.617
Well, somebody said that

07:14.684 --> 07:16.284
the robbers were
wearing nylon masks.

07:16.350 --> 07:18.484
You're going to contaminate
our only DNA link to the guys.

07:18.551 --> 07:19.584
Please put it down.

07:19.651 --> 07:20.617
I photo'd it
and measured it.

07:20.684 --> 07:23.484
Oh.

07:23.551 --> 07:25.751
I learn from my mistakes.

07:25.818 --> 07:26.918
Right.

07:26.983 --> 07:28.017
(clears throat)

07:28.083 --> 07:29.584
(garbled radio transmission)

07:29.651 --> 07:30.950
Great.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.050
Bye.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.784
Let's see who you are,
Mr. Masked Man.

07:50.217 --> 07:51.484
(computer trilling and beeping)

07:51.551 --> 07:54.651
Rodrigo Garza. Wow.

07:54.717 --> 07:56.983
You're even scary
without the mask.

07:57.050 --> 07:59.150
I shoot nobody
at no Ice party, man.

07:59.217 --> 08:02.350
We can put you
at the scene, Rodrigo.

08:02.417 --> 08:05.551
(people screaming)

08:09.551 --> 08:11.884
Turns out the mask

08:11.950 --> 08:14.517
was more valuable to us
than it was to you.

08:14.584 --> 08:16.184
Stick out your hands.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.217
What's-what's
that blue mean?

08:31.284 --> 08:35.784
That means that you shot
Ethan Parker, Rodrigo.

08:36.818 --> 08:38.583
Well, I don't...

08:38.650 --> 08:40.818
I didn't know his name,
all right?

08:40.884 --> 08:43.517
All I know is I told him
to come up off his stuff,

08:43.583 --> 08:45.918
he refused,
he tried to get away, so, yo.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.083
Now!

08:48.150 --> 08:49.584
Hey.

08:49.651 --> 08:50.417
(groans)

08:52.451 --> 08:54.617
What about the
Hudson girl-- Dakota?

08:54.684 --> 08:57.551
My boy had that side of
the party locked down.

08:57.617 --> 08:58.851
What's your buddy's name?

08:58.918 --> 09:02.117
I get some kind of deal?

09:02.184 --> 09:04.684
Not in this lifetime,
Rodrigo.

09:04.751 --> 09:07.818
Well, I ain't talking, papa.

09:09.150 --> 09:10.551
I beg to differ.

09:12.417 --> 09:16.217
WOODS:
COD is percussive injury
to Dakota's heart--

09:16.284 --> 09:18.050
pulverized it.

09:18.117 --> 09:20.684
Wound tract is macerated.

09:20.751 --> 09:23.417
-Do you need some leverage
getting that out?
-I shouldn't.

09:23.484 --> 09:24.818
It's not that deep.

09:24.884 --> 09:26.950
It only penetrated
a couple of inches.

09:27.017 --> 09:29.017
It's just caught
on something.

09:31.818 --> 09:33.284
Well, I'll say.

09:33.350 --> 09:34.751
It mushroomed.

09:34.818 --> 09:36.384
WOODS:
That's odd.
Penetration was shallow.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.317
It shouldn't have
mushroomed.

09:38.384 --> 09:41.417
Uh-uh. It had to have hit
something before it hit her.

09:41.484 --> 09:43.117
May is see it?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.684
There's no trace of anything
else on the bullet.

09:48.284 --> 09:50.751
You know, it's almost like
one of my test-fires

09:50.818 --> 09:52.584
in the tank.

09:52.651 --> 09:54.217
The hollow points
always mushroom.

09:54.284 --> 09:57.284
'Cause water's denser than air.

09:57.350 --> 09:59.050
It slows down the projectile.

10:04.918 --> 10:07.350
So if the bullet was fired
outside of the water,

10:07.417 --> 10:09.150
it never would have
mushroomed like this.

10:10.417 --> 10:12.083
You know what that means.

10:12.150 --> 10:14.284
<i>Dakota's shooter
was in the pool.</i>

10:16.350 --> 10:17.983
(groans)

10:18.050 --> 10:19.417
Exactly.

10:19.484 --> 10:21.451
Thank you, Alexx.

10:42.284 --> 10:43.851
Got a casing.

10:43.918 --> 10:45.684
All the thieves used
nines to steal the jewelry

10:45.751 --> 10:47.451
but this one's
different.

10:47.517 --> 10:49.317
It's a .380.

10:49.384 --> 10:50.851
DUQUESNE:
Confirms there was
a third shooter.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.117
It's starting to look like
Dakota's shooting

10:53.184 --> 10:55.017
didn't have anything
to do with the robbery.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.117
Yeah, well, you can check that
on IBIS, right?

10:57.184 --> 11:00.918
Firing pin impression
is as unique as a gun barrel.

11:05.451 --> 11:08.651
(beeping)

11:08.717 --> 11:11.950
(rapid beeping)

11:15.918 --> 11:17.684
(gunshot)

11:20.083 --> 11:21.117
Yes?

11:21.184 --> 11:22.384
TRIPP:
Miami-Dade PD.

11:22.451 --> 11:24.250
Is your husband
home, ma'am?'

11:24.317 --> 11:25.851
Kevin Iverson.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.417
What has he done this time?

11:28.484 --> 11:30.217
My gun was used to kill someone?

11:30.284 --> 11:33.551
Yeah. Any chance
you were holding it at the time?

11:33.617 --> 11:35.484
No. My gun was stolen
a couple months ago.

11:35.551 --> 11:37.050
You file a police report?

11:37.117 --> 11:39.350
Yes. I can find
you a copy of it.

11:39.417 --> 11:42.684
That's okay. I'll call
and check on it.

11:44.851 --> 11:48.617
Kevin Iverson.

11:48.684 --> 11:50.551
Yeah, I'll hold.

11:50.617 --> 11:53.584
Hey, Frank,
take a look at this.

11:53.651 --> 11:55.384
What is it?

11:55.451 --> 11:56.918
This is a death pool list.

11:56.983 --> 11:57.918
Yeah.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.250
Offshore.

11:59.317 --> 12:00.417
Hover Gambling.

12:00.484 --> 12:02.217
It's totally
legal, Lieutenant.

12:02.284 --> 12:03.684
Called our family
lawyer to make sure.

12:03.751 --> 12:05.717
What in the Sam Hill
do you gamble on?

12:05.784 --> 12:08.184
He is gambling on human lives.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.651
It's a death pool.

12:10.717 --> 12:12.784
I bet on when famous
people are going to die.

12:13.851 --> 12:15.050
Henry Kissinger,

12:15.117 --> 12:17.784
Abe Vigoda, Artie Lange,

12:17.851 --> 12:19.050
Don Ho?

12:19.117 --> 12:20.751
You mean you make picks
like a horse race.

12:20.818 --> 12:22.350
Pot's better.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.551
Mine's 100K.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.150
Thanks.

12:25.217 --> 12:26.684
His story checks out.

12:26.751 --> 12:28.050
He reported the gun stolen

12:28.117 --> 12:29.050
three months ago.

12:29.117 --> 12:30.384
Told you so.

12:30.451 --> 12:32.551
You made $100,000
when someone shot

12:32.617 --> 12:33.751
Dakota Hudson.

12:33.818 --> 12:35.150
I didn't kill her...

12:35.217 --> 12:37.918
but it did put
my total at 157.

12:37.983 --> 12:41.017
Closest person to me
in the pool was at, uh, 149.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.184
(laughs):
On the last day of the pool.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.284
Couldn't believe my luck.

12:44.350 --> 12:46.717
Neither can we, Mr. Iverson.

13:00.234 --> 13:03.067
TRIPP:
Did a little digging
on Hover Gambling.

13:03.134 --> 13:05.301
It's a $50 million-
a-year business.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.734
All the payments are made
in person on the ship.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.533
They get around Florida's ban
on gambling

13:09.600 --> 13:10.600
by anchoring their ship
offshore.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.967
TRIPP:
Yeah, three miles offshore.

13:13.034 --> 13:16.134
Behind that line,
gambling is 100% legit.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.834
And beyond our jurisdiction.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.001
And that's their ship.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.234
<i>The FortuneMaker.</i>

13:20.301 --> 13:21.500
You got to wonder what else

13:21.567 --> 13:22.767
they're betting
on for 50 million.

13:24.101 --> 13:26.434
Who gets the big paycheck
over at Hover Gambling?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.767
His identity
is a well-kept secret, Frank.

13:29.967 --> 13:31.834
I say we bust on the boat
and ask.

13:31.900 --> 13:32.900
We can't board the vessel.

13:32.967 --> 13:34.401
They haven't broken a law.

13:34.468 --> 13:35.934
Wouldn't hurt
to have a look-see.

13:36.001 --> 13:37.468
It's already in motion.

13:53.167 --> 13:55.600
(music playing)

14:17.767 --> 14:19.767
(indistinct chatter)

14:32.468 --> 14:33.967
DUQUESNE:
Are you serious?

14:34.034 --> 14:35.201
A death pool party?

14:35.267 --> 14:36.401
Well, it's the
same old group,

14:36.468 --> 14:38.734
just a new death pool,
and it turns out

14:38.800 --> 14:41.567
Iverson wasn't the only
person to pick Dakota Hudson.

14:41.633 --> 14:44.067
This is the list H
got at Iverson's.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.034
Lamar.

14:46.101 --> 14:48.667
Lamar picked Dakota.
They also had motive.

14:48.734 --> 14:50.567
Okay, so these people
bet at sea

14:50.633 --> 14:52.301
and then they meet
on shore?

14:52.368 --> 14:55.334
Most of them to research their
picks, to handicap, it's, um--

14:55.401 --> 14:57.434
It's a social thing.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.834
You think Lamar
will be there?

14:58.900 --> 15:00.434
I don't know,
but it's worth a shot.

15:10.867 --> 15:13.600
Okay, okay,
let's get started.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.800
Take your seat please.
Thank you.

15:15.867 --> 15:17.234
For you new people,

15:17.301 --> 15:19.201
you get to pick seven
names for your death list.

15:19.267 --> 15:21.301
List goes six months
from midnight tonight.

15:21.368 --> 15:23.401
Each pick begins
at 100 points.

15:23.468 --> 15:25.468
If your guy is 80 years old
when he dies,

15:25.533 --> 15:26.834
you subtract his age, 80,

15:26.900 --> 15:27.967
from 100 to get 20.

15:28.034 --> 15:29.667
You get 20 points
for that pick.

15:29.734 --> 15:32.267
You're going to make your picks
and your points in long shots.

15:32.334 --> 15:34.834
Floor's open.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.633
I'll start, let me
start, let me start.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.234
You guys know Alina
Barranco the opera singer?

15:39.301 --> 15:41.434
Friend at the Manhattan ER
says she has lung cancer.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.834
Lung cancer? Good.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.934
That and her weight--
she's a sure thing.

15:45.001 --> 15:46.600
Yeah, in six months,
though?

15:46.667 --> 15:48.301
I've got relatives who've hung
in for years with lung cancer.

15:48.368 --> 15:50.500
Then don't pick her.
More for me when I win.

15:50.567 --> 15:52.167
Yeah, okay, listen.

15:52.234 --> 15:53.567
The groundskeeper
at the university

15:53.633 --> 15:55.301
said Spencer Mason
got sacked

15:55.368 --> 15:57.767
so bad at practice,
he may have to quit the team.

15:57.834 --> 15:59.633
Concussion or
just a contusion?

15:59.700 --> 16:00.934
I'm still working
on that.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.600
All right, I
heard Michael Ware

16:02.667 --> 16:05.001
let his fall show tank
because he's back on heroin.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.500
MAN:
Is he mainlining
or just smoking?

16:06.567 --> 16:08.301
The needle.
He won't last two months.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.700
Oh, hey, I heard Dakota Hudson
sustained a gunshot wound

16:11.767 --> 16:13.301
to the torso this morning.

16:13.368 --> 16:14.734
You can't pick her.
She's dead.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.700
Yeah, we know that.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.201
She was my long shot
last time.

16:21.368 --> 16:23.567
So you must be Lamar.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.700
Rebecca Lamar.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.600
You're going to need
to come with us.

16:29.101 --> 16:30.734
Mommy?

16:30.800 --> 16:32.700
I'm going to need
to bring my son.

16:33.734 --> 16:35.067
Won't be a problem.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.001
DUQUESNE:
Do you know Kevin Iverson?

16:41.067 --> 16:43.567
Yeah, he's a death pooler.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.734
I know him from
the parties.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.533
Is there any chance
you borrowed his gun?

16:48.633 --> 16:51.401
He told us his
gun was stolen.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.767
We're looking into
the stolen gun report.

16:53.834 --> 16:54.834
However,

16:54.900 --> 16:56.267
you and Kevin
were the only ones

16:56.334 --> 16:59.567
who stood to benefit
from Dakota's death.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.700
Wait, you think--

17:01.767 --> 17:03.334
I didn't shoot anyone.

17:03.401 --> 17:06.500
She was young, healthy, 25 years
old; that's worth 75 points.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.101
Too healthy

17:08.166 --> 17:09.666
for a death pooler.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.101
I traded her a month ago

17:11.166 --> 17:13.101
when she checked herself
into rehab.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.567
To whom?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.468
To Todd 321.

17:17.532 --> 17:19.300
Was Todd 321
at the death pool party?

17:19.367 --> 17:21.134
No.

17:21.201 --> 17:22.599
He's paranoid.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.300
He thinks we're all going
to steal his picks.

17:25.367 --> 17:26.733
DUQUESNE:
Will you write down
any information

17:26.800 --> 17:28.567
you may have about him?
Sure.

17:28.633 --> 17:30.767
Do you know when my
mom will be finished?

17:30.834 --> 17:33.267
It shouldn't take
that much longer.

17:33.334 --> 17:34.500
What's your name?

17:34.567 --> 17:36.967
-Tyler.
-Tyler. That's a cool name.

17:39.001 --> 17:41.867
Is my mom in trouble
for not paying bills again?

17:41.934 --> 17:46.401
Partner, right now, we're just
asking her some questions,

17:46.468 --> 17:48.034
but here's what
I want you to do.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.967
If you need my help,

17:50.034 --> 17:51.934
anything at
all, I want you

17:52.001 --> 17:53.600
to call that number, okay,
and I'll be there.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.834
Okay, thanks.
All right.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.034
I'm going to keep this.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.101
REBECCA:
You ready, Tyler?

18:00.167 --> 18:02.600
Yes, Mom.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.533
Ma'am, your son is
very concerned about you.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.767
I love him very much.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.767
Come on, let's go.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.434
See you, Tyler.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.934
Can we ride water bikes?

18:17.001 --> 18:19.633
REBECCA:
We'll see, let's
not miss the bus.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.334
What do you think?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.034
She checks out.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.967
She gave us information
on a Todd.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.967
She traded him Dakota Hudson
in the death pool.

18:27.034 --> 18:28.967
Here's the address.

18:29.034 --> 18:31.201
MAN:
She's all yours.

18:31.267 --> 18:33.401
Take care of her.

18:37.468 --> 18:38.401
CAINE:
Hey, Todd.

18:38.468 --> 18:39.633
Too late,
I just sold it.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.867
Todd Baransky?

18:45.201 --> 18:48.734
I guess you're not making enough
on the death pool, huh, Todd?

18:49.867 --> 18:52.667
Oh, man, I should
have stuck to weather.

18:52.734 --> 18:54.667
TRIPP:
Weather?

18:54.734 --> 18:56.900
-You mean rain, sleet?
-Yeah.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.167
I was on a roll, man.

18:58.234 --> 19:00.267
I called four flash storms
in a row.

19:00.334 --> 19:02.633
Highest recorded temperature
of September.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.401
Lowest humidity
in the panhandle.

19:04.468 --> 19:08.167
Okay?
Then, my luck changed a little.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.001
Till you found a winner
with Dakota Hudson, right?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.900
Dakota was shot
this morning.

19:12.967 --> 19:15.368
No, I ended up
eight points short.

19:15.434 --> 19:17.734
Yes, to Kevin Iverson;
we know about it.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.234
Man, I needed that win.

19:19.301 --> 19:20.167
That's why I sold my car--
back payment.

19:20.234 --> 19:21.734
Yes, to Hover Gambling.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.533
Yeah.

19:23.600 --> 19:27.334
I got a little behind, big deal.

19:27.401 --> 19:28.500
Guy sprained my wrist!

19:28.567 --> 19:30.067
He threw my head
up against the wall!

19:30.134 --> 19:31.401
I spent the night
in the hospital!

19:31.468 --> 19:32.867
I didn't get out
till after lunch today!

19:32.934 --> 19:35.533
How long have you been
gambling with Hover?

19:35.600 --> 19:36.934
Three years.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.800
One by one,
I've seen it all go, man.

19:38.867 --> 19:41.134
The dental practice, house, car.

19:41.201 --> 19:42.967
Todd, let us help you.

19:43.034 --> 19:44.267
How?

19:44.334 --> 19:46.034
Offshore betting is legal.

19:46.101 --> 19:49.267
Yes, but assault
and battery aren't.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.734
His name is Shin.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.834
I don't know if it's a first
or last name, but...

19:57.900 --> 19:59.700
he hangs out
at the bar at the National.

19:59.767 --> 20:02.134
That's a good start.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.500
Mr. Shin?

20:09.567 --> 20:10.567
Should I know you?

20:10.633 --> 20:11.834
You do now.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.001
Last night,

20:13.067 --> 20:14.800
you beat somebody
over a gambling debt.

20:14.867 --> 20:16.167
His name is Todd Baransky.

20:16.234 --> 20:17.401
Does that ring a bell?

20:17.468 --> 20:20.101
He fell, I helped him up.

20:20.167 --> 20:21.734
How many times?

20:21.800 --> 20:23.001
Stand up.

20:32.767 --> 20:33.767
Uh-huh.

20:37.234 --> 20:38.633
Knuckle duster.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.201
Mr. Shin, if I find
Todd Baransky's DNA on that,

20:41.267 --> 20:44.167
you're going to prison
for ten years.

20:44.234 --> 20:45.533
The Tekko is for protection.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.368
I do promotions
for Hover Gambling.

20:47.434 --> 20:49.600
Promotions?

20:49.667 --> 20:51.434
We give incentives to
hotels and restaurants

20:51.500 --> 20:53.967
to encourage tourists to
visit our gambling ships.

20:54.034 --> 20:55.633
In Texas,
we call that a bribe.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.167
Look at that.

20:57.234 --> 20:58.401
Well, there you go.

20:58.468 --> 20:59.834
<i>Is that for promotions,
Mr. Shin?</i>

20:59.900 --> 21:01.967
Gotta spend money
to make money.

21:02.034 --> 21:04.234
Probably print it in
your cousin's garage.

21:04.301 --> 21:05.533
However,

21:05.600 --> 21:08.468
I hate to say this,
but this looks perfect.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.001
Maybe too perfect.

21:10.067 --> 21:11.334
Hook him up, Frank.

21:12.368 --> 21:13.633
Thank you, Mr. Shin.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.734
I'll make bail
in an hour.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.134
Calleigh.

21:17.201 --> 21:18.734
I believe you have
a phone number I need.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.234
Contact the Treasury.

21:31.734 --> 21:33.500
You think these bills
are authentic?

21:33.567 --> 21:34.900
I think so.

21:34.967 --> 21:37.834
Paper is three-quarters cotton,
one-quarter linen.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.167
There's watermark,
color-shifting ink,

21:39.234 --> 21:40.167
and security strips.

21:40.234 --> 21:41.867
Right on all counts.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.667
They're even made by an
Intaglio press, but...
Mm-hmm.

21:43.734 --> 21:45.167
But what?

21:45.234 --> 21:46.867
They're counterfeit.

21:46.934 --> 21:47.934
I don't understand.

21:48.001 --> 21:49.267
I thought that
Intaglio presses

21:49.334 --> 21:50.700
were only available
to governments.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.734
They are, which tells me,
Calleigh, this is a supernote.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.834
Good enough to undermine
an entire economy.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.234
So what makes it
a supernote?

21:57.301 --> 21:58.368
The ink on a supernote

21:58.434 --> 21:59.967
lies flat on the currency

22:00.034 --> 22:03.001
while on a genuine note
the ink is slightly raised.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.867
The plates they use
for a supernote

22:04.934 --> 22:07.067
leave a slightly sharper edge
then on the genuine one.

22:07.134 --> 22:09.533
It's especially obvious on
the hands of the clock tower.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.934
Can you see that?

22:11.001 --> 22:13.234
I guess. I don't know.

22:13.301 --> 22:14.734
I think I just
can't see it.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.867
All right, the easiest way
is if you compare bills.

22:16.934 --> 22:18.034
Uh, I only have 20s.

22:18.101 --> 22:19.234
You got a hundred on you?

22:19.301 --> 22:20.368
Uh, yeah, I brought one
just in case.

22:20.434 --> 22:22.500
Great.

22:25.533 --> 22:27.434
Okay, so...

22:34.600 --> 22:36.234
Calleigh, this is
a supernote, too.

22:36.301 --> 22:37.900
What?

22:37.967 --> 22:40.134
The hands on the clock
are pristine.

22:42.368 --> 22:43.834
Really?

22:43.900 --> 22:45.767
Either their fake currency
has already been introduced

22:45.834 --> 22:47.600
into the local economy,

22:47.667 --> 22:49.834
or you're betting
with Hover Gambling.

22:53.234 --> 22:54.934
I'm going to have to seize this.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.434
Of course.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.600
Excuse me. I'm going
to need to find Horatio.

23:10.234 --> 23:11.267
Hey.

23:11.334 --> 23:12.834
Hey.

23:12.900 --> 23:15.201
You remember that iPod
I picked up for your niece?

23:15.267 --> 23:18.001
Oh, yeah. When I was doing
my extended shifts last week.

23:18.067 --> 23:21.401
I meant to thank you
for that.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.301
Then hundred dollar bill
you paid me back with,
it was counterfeit.

23:27.934 --> 23:29.334
What?

23:29.401 --> 23:32.500
Not only is it counterfeit,
it's a supernote.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.101
Peter Elliot has it

23:34.167 --> 23:37.800
and he's sending it to
his bosses in Washington.

23:37.867 --> 23:40.900
You play the death pool?

23:42.867 --> 23:44.334
Yeah, once.

23:44.401 --> 23:46.468
I should have known,
the way you talked about it,

23:46.533 --> 23:48.533
your familiarity
with the handicap system.

23:48.600 --> 23:52.934
I gave some money to my friend,
he placed a bet.

23:53.001 --> 23:57.267
It was Lou Rawls
on January six, and, uh...

23:57.334 --> 24:00.134
I don't know, it was a total
fluke-- it paid out.

24:00.201 --> 24:02.167
Do you realize what you've done?

24:02.234 --> 24:07.167
Well, let's see, it's off-shore,
so it's legal.

24:07.234 --> 24:08.633
The payouts aren't.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.468
Hover Gambling is dirty.

24:10.533 --> 24:11.734
All right, you know what?

24:11.800 --> 24:13.368
I'll deal with Peter myself.

24:13.434 --> 24:14.567
No! It's done.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.167
You know what?

24:17.234 --> 24:19.034
I don't need you to take
the heat for me on this.

24:19.101 --> 24:20.533
If this goes any deeper
into this lab,

24:20.600 --> 24:22.334
there's going to be
a full-blown investigation,

24:22.401 --> 24:23.600
we will lose
our accreditation.

24:23.667 --> 24:25.567
The buck stops with me--
have you got it?

24:26.600 --> 24:28.900
Yeah, I got it.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.333
(siren blaring)

25:06.417 --> 25:10.117
<i>MAN (over megaphone):
Attention, FortuneMaker,
prepare to be boarded.</i>

25:17.983 --> 25:19.017
Welcome. Miami-Dade
Police Department.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.250
DELKO:
That's right.

25:20.317 --> 25:23.084
You've got
quite an operation here.

25:23.150 --> 25:25.250
I'm just providing
a first-class venue

25:25.317 --> 25:27.517
for people to do what they're
going to do anyway.

25:27.584 --> 25:28.917
Gambling is America's
new pastime.

25:28.983 --> 25:31.150
You must be
thrilled about that.

25:31.217 --> 25:33.250
I'd like to take
a look around.

25:33.317 --> 25:36.250
I'll give you a personal tour.

25:37.517 --> 25:40.250
(machines playing playful tones)

25:50.351 --> 25:52.050
HOST:
This is our main hall.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.751
It's not just about gambling.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.017
It's about entertaining.

25:55.084 --> 25:57.950
Not only do we have
no-limit wages,

25:58.017 --> 25:59.883
but our service is no-limit.

25:59.950 --> 26:02.284
And gambling is truly
a victimless crime.

26:02.351 --> 26:05.250
Dakota Hudson's family may
feel differently, Mr. Choi.

26:05.317 --> 26:07.718
But death is
the ultimate gamble.

26:07.784 --> 26:09.551
Yes, but in this case,
no matter who dies,

26:09.617 --> 26:11.050
the house wins, doesn't it?

26:11.117 --> 26:13.250
Well, we don't control the names
on the death pool.

26:13.317 --> 26:15.050
We're only responsible
for the payout.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.584
Okay. Your payouts
are counterfeit,

26:16.651 --> 26:18.651
and you're making the bills
aboard this ship.

26:18.718 --> 26:21.417
Those fake hundreds have
diesel fuel on them.

26:21.484 --> 26:23.983
My lab ran it.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.117
(chuckling):
You're out of your jurisdiction.

26:26.184 --> 26:27.718
But you know this.

26:27.784 --> 26:29.351
I don't have
to show you anything.

26:29.417 --> 26:31.983
Then I'm here as a guest.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.751
Hey, Frank.

26:40.818 --> 26:42.617
Have you had any leads
on the second thief's name?

26:42.684 --> 26:44.084
-Oh, sorry.
-Zip.

26:44.150 --> 26:45.651
Any leads on
the jewelry?

26:45.718 --> 26:48.451
Pawn shops, estate sales.

26:48.517 --> 26:50.317
You know, if the second guy
unloaded the jewelry...

26:50.384 --> 26:52.017
You know what?
I'm talking to a diamond broker.

26:52.084 --> 26:55.751
Yeah.

26:55.818 --> 26:57.451
No?

26:57.517 --> 27:00.417
All right, thanks
for your trouble.

27:00.484 --> 27:03.517
Jewels aren't being fenced
anywhere, at least locally.

27:03.584 --> 27:05.551
You know, it doesn't
make any sense to me

27:05.617 --> 27:08.651
a guy would drive a trunk-load
full of jewelry

27:08.718 --> 27:11.484
outside of Miami and risk
getting arrested by a Statie.

27:11.551 --> 27:12.617
It's got...

27:12.684 --> 27:14.084
What did I miss?

27:14.150 --> 27:16.818
Take a look at Dakota's earlobe,
the inflammation.

27:18.084 --> 27:21.484
Witnesses said the thief
ripped out her earrings.

27:21.551 --> 27:23.617
I don't think that's what caused

27:23.684 --> 27:25.818
this red, swollen area--
I think it's infected.

27:25.883 --> 27:27.150
You know, I had

27:27.217 --> 27:28.718
this same problem
back in college.

27:28.784 --> 27:29.983
From what?

27:30.050 --> 27:33.150
Cheap jewelry.

27:43.651 --> 27:45.317
That Ethan's jewelry?

27:45.384 --> 27:47.017
It's the only jewelry
we collected,

27:47.084 --> 27:49.883
'cause the the only one
who wouldn't give it up.

27:50.950 --> 27:52.883
Chain, watch, cell phone,

27:52.950 --> 27:54.818
all valued
at a quarter million dollars.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.050
All right.

27:56.117 --> 27:57.818
Testing mineral
fracture toughness?

27:57.883 --> 28:00.217
How many mega-pascals do
you want to start with?

28:00.284 --> 28:01.983
Well...

28:02.050 --> 28:03.684
diamond's ten
on the Mohs' scale.

28:03.751 --> 28:06.617
You want to try seven?
Sure.

28:06.684 --> 28:09.551
(beeping)

28:18.484 --> 28:20.284
(beeping)

28:22.217 --> 28:23.850
Busted at seven;
it's glass.

28:23.917 --> 28:25.950
Well, lookie there.

28:26.017 --> 28:28.250
It's no wonder nobody's
hocking Mr. Ice's wares.

28:28.317 --> 28:29.751
They're fake.

28:29.818 --> 28:33.917
Well, I'm going to get Ryan
and pay Mr. Ice a visit.

28:48.617 --> 28:50.217
(grinding noise nearby)

29:04.718 --> 29:06.551
Miami-Dade PD!

29:06.617 --> 29:07.917
DELKO:
Don't move! Don't move!

29:07.983 --> 29:08.850
Don't move!
Let me see
the hands.

29:08.917 --> 29:10.751
Let me see the hands.

29:10.818 --> 29:12.983
OFFICER:
Don't move!

29:18.017 --> 29:19.451
(chuckles lightly)

29:19.517 --> 29:21.983
Pretty creative way
to destroy evidence.

29:23.517 --> 29:25.050
Did you know that
you need a permit

29:25.117 --> 29:26.317
to use a woodchipper
near the water?

29:26.384 --> 29:27.718
You arresting me for that?

29:27.784 --> 29:29.551
No, grand theft and fraud.

29:29.617 --> 29:32.451
A lot of rich people
are going to want to
see you in prison.

29:32.517 --> 29:34.250
I didn't start out
using glass stones.

29:34.317 --> 29:37.250
I just realized I could make
bigger money using fakes.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.917
You had to figure
someone was going to
find out eventually.

29:39.983 --> 29:41.883
A secret like that
can't last forever.

29:41.950 --> 29:44.850
I decided to throw a party,
invite all my customers.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.384
I knew they'd wear my jewelry.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.818
Right and you got this thug

29:47.883 --> 29:49.517
and his little pal
Garza to show up,

29:49.584 --> 29:51.084
take all the jewelry?

29:51.150 --> 29:52.451
You figured the rich people
would file insurance claims.

29:52.517 --> 29:53.484
They'd get their money back.

29:53.551 --> 29:55.850
I remain
"Jeweler to the A-list."

29:55.917 --> 29:57.484
Go back to using
real bling.

29:57.551 --> 29:59.451
WOLFE:
So then why'd your guys
kill Ethan Parker?

29:59.517 --> 30:00.617
That was them, not me.

30:00.684 --> 30:02.517
Liar!
Hey, hey!

30:02.584 --> 30:03.983
All I wanted was a simple heist.

30:04.050 --> 30:06.184
Hey, man, he told me and Garza
to cap that kid.

30:06.250 --> 30:07.484
Just Garza got to him first.

30:07.551 --> 30:08.950
He's fronting.
Get off me!

30:09.017 --> 30:11.484
DELKO:
Put him in the car!

30:11.551 --> 30:13.017
What if I told you

30:13.084 --> 30:14.718
that your little rich
kid client, Ethan,

30:14.784 --> 30:17.584
figured out that
the jewelry you
sold him was fake?

30:18.950 --> 30:20.818
These aren't real diamonds--
you're a fraud.

30:20.917 --> 30:22.284
Who else knows besides you?

30:22.351 --> 30:24.217
No one yet,
but I've got a big mouth.

30:24.284 --> 30:25.584
You'd better shut up.

30:25.651 --> 30:27.983
I don't think you
can make me shut up.

30:28.050 --> 30:29.818
I do.

30:29.883 --> 30:32.417
WOLFE:
So you had him killed.

30:33.917 --> 30:35.250
Get him to MDPD.

30:35.317 --> 30:37.284
You're both going down.

31:14.017 --> 31:15.384
Excuse me.

31:17.651 --> 31:19.250
That stain on your hand?

31:23.250 --> 31:24.818
(glass shattering)

31:24.883 --> 31:27.117
You know, Lieutenant, I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

31:27.184 --> 31:28.617
Don't bother, Mr. Choi.

31:28.684 --> 31:30.484
I got what I came for.

31:47.584 --> 31:49.417
Lieutenant Caine.

31:49.484 --> 31:52.351
<i>You're poking around
my jurisdiction now?</i>

31:52.417 --> 31:53.784
I guess that means
that you're investigating

31:53.850 --> 31:55.718
Hover Gambling,
as well, Agent Cole.

31:55.784 --> 31:58.784
<i>We're keeping a close
watch on The FortuneMaker.</i>

31:58.850 --> 32:00.751
Are you aware
that they're manufacturing

32:00.818 --> 32:02.784
bogus currency
aboard that ship?

32:02.850 --> 32:04.883
I just met a man, Agent Cole,

32:04.950 --> 32:08.384
that had a very curious
ink stain on his hands.

32:08.451 --> 32:10.983
That could get you
a warrant if you chose.

32:11.050 --> 32:14.317
We know all about
the supernotes.

32:14.384 --> 32:16.451
You know
about the notes?

32:16.517 --> 32:18.284
Lee Choi works for the
North Korean government.

32:18.351 --> 32:19.484
Of course, he does.

32:19.551 --> 32:21.317
That's how he got
the press.

32:21.384 --> 32:24.584
But we don't want to
arrest him for the money.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.950
Who are you
planning to arrest?

32:27.017 --> 32:29.983
We are trying to get to their
top government officials

32:30.050 --> 32:31.417
for that and more.

32:31.484 --> 32:33.617
Selling missile technology,

32:33.684 --> 32:35.451
illegal weapons sales
to our enemies.

32:35.517 --> 32:37.150
Phony currency
could collapse

32:37.217 --> 32:39.751
the economy of Miami,
Agent Cole.

32:39.850 --> 32:42.484
(scoffs):
We're not going to let it
get that bad.

32:42.761 --> 32:43.611
Neither will I

33:00.484 --> 33:01.817
Hey, Cooper?

33:01.884 --> 33:03.184
I thought you were working
the Ice party case with us.

33:03.251 --> 33:05.117
I am. Just showing
a little initiative.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.451
Oh, fantastic.

33:06.518 --> 33:07.884
What have you got?

33:07.950 --> 33:10.618
We know for certain
that Dakota Hudson was shot

33:10.683 --> 33:12.117
with Kevin Iverson's gun, right?

33:12.184 --> 33:14.950
Yeah, Tripp just found it three
blocks from the crime scene.

33:15.017 --> 33:16.850
That might explain this.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.050
I pulled that case file.

33:18.117 --> 33:19.284
Turns out the detective

33:19.351 --> 33:21.151
on the burglary
saved the 911 tape.

33:21.217 --> 33:22.251
I'm listening.

33:22.317 --> 33:23.451
Good.

33:23.518 --> 33:25.184
Listen to this.

33:25.251 --> 33:27.284
911 Operator.
What is your emergency?

33:27.351 --> 33:29.950
IVERSON:
Uh, uh, someone
broke into my house.

33:30.017 --> 33:32.017
They took my TV and gun.

33:32.984 --> 33:34.817
Yeah, that is odd.

33:34.884 --> 33:36.618
As Tripp would say, it's hinky.

33:36.683 --> 33:38.584
I can him missing his
television right away,

33:38.650 --> 33:40.117
but his gun?

33:40.184 --> 33:41.650
He's lying.

33:42.850 --> 33:45.417
I'm going to take
a look at that gun.

33:46.484 --> 33:48.317
I'm going to give you credit.

33:48.384 --> 33:51.817
Thank you.

33:55.584 --> 33:57.351
When cops find
the murder weapon

33:57.417 --> 33:59.683
three blocks from the crime
scene, they want results.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.017
You know, Frank, it is not
going to help the case

34:02.084 --> 34:04.151
if I do a sloppy job.

34:04.217 --> 34:06.783
Well, I mean...
how hard is it?

34:06.850 --> 34:09.650
Just test fire Iverson's gun
and compare the rounds.

34:09.717 --> 34:12.551
(laughs):
I am getting to it.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.083
Hey, you know what?

34:14.150 --> 34:15.717
I think there's some fabric
caught in the slide.

34:15.783 --> 34:17.850
Let me see.

34:18.884 --> 34:20.583
Huh.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.251
Agostina.

34:24.117 --> 34:27.083
Iverson's wife's a fan.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.949
You know, your knowledge
of the fashion world,

34:29.016 --> 34:30.650
it's-it's impressive.

34:30.717 --> 34:33.016
Do you have something
you want to tell me?

34:33.083 --> 34:34.417
What?

34:34.484 --> 34:36.184
It's my ex-wife's
favorite designer.

34:36.251 --> 34:38.618
She put me in hock
with that stuff.

34:38.683 --> 34:41.050
Okay. If that's your story.

34:41.117 --> 34:45.184
So, um, tell me how fast you
can get Mrs. Iverson here.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.518
The gun dealer
ID'd your photo.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.683
You bought your
husband's gun back.

34:50.750 --> 34:53.117
His father
gave it to him.

34:53.184 --> 34:54.917
He loved that gun.

34:54.984 --> 34:57.950
You went to the Ice party
to shoot Dakota.

34:58.017 --> 35:00.351
It was the last day
of the death pool,

35:00.417 --> 35:02.351
and I guess you figured
with her stint in rehab,

35:02.417 --> 35:04.217
it'd be an easy opportunity

35:04.284 --> 35:06.351
to put one in the win
column for your husband.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.217
Can you prove that?

35:08.284 --> 35:10.317
Yes. We're executing
a search warrant

35:10.384 --> 35:12.717
on your house as we
speak to look for this.

35:12.783 --> 35:16.351
It's a match of the Agostina
dress you were wearing.

35:16.417 --> 35:18.417
It caught in the gun slide
as you shot Dakota.

35:21.518 --> 35:23.217
(laughs)

35:23.284 --> 35:27.151
There's gotta be hundreds
of dresses that look like that.

35:27.217 --> 35:29.417
No, you were the only one
with the gun and the dress.

35:31.484 --> 35:33.251
Katrina, we got you.

35:46.850 --> 35:51.317
Kevin... (sighs)

35:51.384 --> 35:58.284
<i>Kevin finally got his big win
so we could start fresh.</i>

35:58.351 --> 36:01.050
All I want is a fresh start.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.484
I'm afraid that's
not going to happen.

36:05.551 --> 36:07.151
(gasps)

36:07.217 --> 36:09.184
Oh, my God.

36:11.217 --> 36:14.217
(crying):
Oh, my God.

36:17.251 --> 36:20.618
(crying)

36:20.683 --> 36:23.850
(cell phone ringing)

36:25.917 --> 36:28.451
This is Horatio Caine.

36:28.518 --> 36:29.917
I'm sorry, I can't...

36:29.984 --> 36:33.317
Tyler? Tyler!

36:33.384 --> 36:34.551
Tyler, where are you?

36:34.618 --> 36:36.518
Tyler?

36:42.451 --> 36:45.518
Rebecca.

36:45.551 --> 36:46.551
Rebecca, where's Tyler?

36:46.618 --> 36:47.950
You were supposed to bring him.

36:48.017 --> 36:49.650
He's with a babysitter.

36:49.717 --> 36:51.184
He's not with a babysitter.
Where is he?

36:51.251 --> 36:52.351
He's fine.

36:52.417 --> 36:53.817
Rebecca, where is he?

36:55.618 --> 36:58.484
I owed some money,
and I used him as collateral.

36:58.551 --> 36:59.750
Okay, so you sold him.

36:59.817 --> 37:00.950
No, they're just holding on
to him.

37:01.017 --> 37:02.217
I'm going to win him back.

37:02.584 --> 37:03.918
Who did you sell him to?

37:05.851 --> 37:07.217
(sighs)

37:07.284 --> 37:10.451
A pony-tailed guy
who works for Mr. Choi.

37:12.451 --> 37:14.384
You make me sick.

37:14.451 --> 37:16.150
(gasps)

37:16.217 --> 37:18.384
(sighs heavily)

37:23.551 --> 37:25.451
Agent Cole. Horatio Caine.

37:25.517 --> 37:27.784
I'm looking for your phone taps
on the gambling ship,

37:27.851 --> 37:29.417
a specific number.

37:29.484 --> 37:30.784
Give it to me.
Right.

37:30.851 --> 37:34.717
The number is 305-555-0133.

37:34.784 --> 37:37.017
Checking.

37:37.083 --> 37:40.250
They called that number from the
ship's office a half-hour ago.

37:40.317 --> 37:42.217
Who's number is it?

37:42.284 --> 37:44.784
(closes phone)
It's mine.

37:55.950 --> 37:59.417
<i>FortuneMaker,
this is the US Coast Guard.</i>

37:59.484 --> 38:01.317
Prepare to be boarded.

38:01.384 --> 38:04.384
(men shouting orders)

38:06.017 --> 38:09.017
(shouting orders)

38:09.083 --> 38:11.384
(people laughing and cheering)

38:13.150 --> 38:15.117
US Coast Guard!

38:15.184 --> 38:17.384
(men shouting orders)

38:20.617 --> 38:22.417
Hands where I can see them!

38:22.484 --> 38:24.784
Hands where I can see them!
Hands where I can see them!

38:24.851 --> 38:28.083
(shoing continues in distance)

38:31.517 --> 38:33.017
Where's my mom?

38:33.083 --> 38:34.717
You shut up.

38:37.451 --> 38:39.884
CAINE:
Mr. Choi?

38:39.983 --> 38:41.884
That'll be enough.
I'm closing you down.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.350
You have no right to do this.

38:43.417 --> 38:44.818
Everything on this ship
is legal.

38:44.884 --> 38:45.884
Everything but the boy.

38:45.950 --> 38:47.250
Now stand up, turn around

38:47.317 --> 38:49.350
and put your hands
on your head right now. Do it.

38:53.217 --> 38:54.150
Gentlemen.

38:54.217 --> 38:55.217
US Coast Guard.

38:55.284 --> 38:57.484
(handcuffs clicking)

38:57.551 --> 38:58.717
You're under arrest for
false imprisonment

38:58.784 --> 39:01.350
and kidnapping
of a minor.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.451
You okay, son?

39:03.517 --> 39:06.083
I knew you'd find me.

39:06.150 --> 39:07.250
I wasn't going
to leave you, Tyler.

39:07.317 --> 39:08.651
Come on.

39:24.551 --> 39:26.551
(talking quietly)

39:31.918 --> 39:35.317
We found over a million dollars
in supernotes, so far.

39:35.384 --> 39:36.818
Printing press is gone.

39:36.884 --> 39:39.184
Don't worry, Agent Cole,
it's going to turn up.

39:39.250 --> 39:41.651
Just so it's not
in Miami, right?

39:41.717 --> 39:43.484
(chuckles):
Not if they're smart.

39:43.551 --> 39:45.484
Agent Cole?

39:46.417 --> 39:47.784
Take care.

39:47.851 --> 39:50.083
(chuckles)

40:09.184 --> 40:13.517
(brakes squeak)

41:04.250 --> 41:06.717
Tyler?

41:08.784 --> 41:11.451
I love you, baby.

41:12.451 --> 41:14.417
Mommy?

41:45.317 --> 41:47.317
(fire crackling)

42:13.784 --> 42:15.784
People gambling
their lives away

42:15.851 --> 42:18.317
and getting paid
in fake hundreds.

42:18.384 --> 42:20.884
Yeah, well,
I hope we never see them again.

42:20.950 --> 42:23.250
Yeah, well,
me, too.

42:23.317 --> 42:27.317
So, just how good
were those bills?

42:27.384 --> 42:31.717
More real than you can imagine.

42:34.784 --> 42:36.517
I guess somebody
will always think it's easy

42:36.584 --> 42:38.083
to make a hundred.

42:39.117 --> 42:41.017
But we...

42:41.083 --> 42:44.350
we know different, don't we?
