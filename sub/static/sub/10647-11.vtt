00:08.779 --> 00:11.920
Dr.Octopus: I was certain
my sinister seven would destroy you

00:11.966 --> 00:14.419
and everything
you believed in, Spider-Man.

00:14.614 --> 00:17.789
But even I never predicted
my most hated foe

00:17.862 --> 00:21.614
was a mere child
named Peter Parker.

00:21.911 --> 00:24.177
This is the most
terrible day of my life.

00:24.302 --> 00:26.553
<i>Dr.Octopus put together
a new sinister six</i>

00:26.599 --> 00:28.532
<i>and took down
the rest of my team.</i>

00:28.677 --> 00:30.741
<i>Hydro-Man is outside,
threatening to destroy</i>

00:30.787 --> 00:32.482
<i>the Triskelion
once and for all.</i>

00:32.613 --> 00:34.380
<i>That's not the worst of it.</i>

00:34.426 --> 00:37.115
<i>Scarlet Spider, who I
trusted with everything,</i>

00:37.161 --> 00:38.778
<i>including my secret identity,</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:40.880
<i>turned out to be
a spy for Ock.</i>

00:41.052 --> 00:43.474
And he's just betrayed me
to his boss.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.897
Ben, how could you do this?

00:45.943 --> 00:49.193
"Ben" is only the name you
and your aunt gave me.

00:49.318 --> 00:50.835
It means nothing.

00:51.005 --> 00:54.100
Scarlet Spider is my most
successful experiment.

00:54.294 --> 00:56.941
Lizard, Rhino,
mere trial runs.

00:57.114 --> 00:59.577
This is my
greatest work.

00:59.763 --> 01:01.200
(Struggling)

01:01.333 --> 01:02.980
You said
Ock tortured you,

01:03.138 --> 01:05.239
made you
into a monster.

01:05.474 --> 01:07.544
Scarlet Spider: (Scoffs)
All lies to earn your trust.

01:07.661 --> 01:09.442
Ock took me in years ago,

01:09.488 --> 01:10.955
rescued me from the streets,

01:11.001 --> 01:12.411
then gave me powers

01:12.457 --> 01:15.138
beyond my wildest imagination.

01:15.302 --> 01:17.622
I owe everything to him.

01:20.208 --> 01:23.177
Most of my sinister seven
have been defeated.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.013
But they completed
their mission,

01:25.106 --> 01:26.827
destroying
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy

01:26.873 --> 01:28.825
and all of your
precious friends.

01:28.934 --> 01:31.684
Now, the last movement
in my final symphony.

01:31.794 --> 01:33.575
Give me the key
that will empower me

01:33.621 --> 01:36.286
to destroy
my keepers, Hydra.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.778
Key? I don't even
have any pockets.

01:38.851 --> 01:40.638
Do not take me
for a fool.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.787
I know Connors
gave you this key

01:42.833 --> 01:45.684
to the anti-Hydra weapon.
Where is it?

01:45.719 --> 01:48.442
(GRUNTS) You know, I'd love to
help you out, of course,

01:48.488 --> 01:50.942
but I've never seen
that thing in my life.

01:51.052 --> 01:52.708
Scarlet Spider: Wait.

01:52.899 --> 01:54.169
I know where it is.

01:54.286 --> 01:55.699
At his aunt May's house.

01:55.755 --> 01:56.770
No!

01:56.816 --> 01:59.937
(LAUGHS)
Aunt May.

02:01.036 --> 02:02.856
Get me that key,
Scarlet Spider,

02:02.919 --> 02:05.661
and destroy anyone
who gets in your way.

02:05.747 --> 02:06.974
You got it, boss.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.676
(GRUNTS)

02:08.809 --> 02:10.770
Ben, don't do this!

02:13.286 --> 02:14.825
Ben, no!

It's me you want!

02:30.215 --> 02:32.552
This has nothing
to do with aunt May!

02:34.005 --> 02:35.606
(GROANS)

02:35.809 --> 02:39.005
This has everything to do
with her, Peter Parker.

02:39.106 --> 02:41.395
I have had
so Many opportunities

02:41.441 --> 02:43.567
to simply destroy you.

02:44.473 --> 02:47.122
(GRUNTS) Yeah,
I've noticed.

02:47.168 --> 02:50.083
But your mere destruction
wouldn't satisfy me.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.670
I needed to break you.

02:51.723 --> 02:55.184
Destroy everything
you care about.

02:55.356 --> 02:57.325
I'm not broken yet, Ock!

02:57.450 --> 02:59.138
Dr.Octopus:
Oh, but you are!

02:59.184 --> 03:02.083
You and your pathetic
faith in other people.

03:02.216 --> 03:05.325
I knew you'd accept
my Scarlet Spider into your ranks.

03:05.371 --> 03:07.638
Hmm, so naive.

03:07.833 --> 03:11.200
You thought your team
made you strong, Spider-Man,

03:11.246 --> 03:13.216
but they were
your greatest weakness,

03:13.262 --> 03:15.677
leading you straight to defeat!

03:34.734 --> 03:36.533
(Dishes clattering)

03:38.263 --> 03:39.240
Aunt May: Hello?

03:39.286 --> 03:40.912
Oh, I didn't
hear you knOck.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.763
Uh, the door was open.

03:47.450 --> 03:50.414
No. I just locked it
for the night.

03:52.044 --> 03:55.145
Okay, look, I snuck in
through the window.

03:55.192 --> 03:56.623
I didn't know if
you were asleep,

03:56.669 --> 03:59.286
and I didn't want
to wake you, or something.

03:59.567 --> 04:02.950
(SIGHS) Is this some kind of
prank Peter's putting you up to?

04:03.020 --> 04:05.684
Wait, was that call
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

04:05.730 --> 04:08.980
Just cover for some kind
of birthday surprise?

04:09.058 --> 04:10.527
Peter sent me to get this.

04:10.582 --> 04:12.519
Apparently, it's
something important.

04:12.597 --> 04:14.472
Well, then you'd better
get it back to him.

04:14.638 --> 04:16.856
But next time, just knock.

04:16.902 --> 04:19.261
You're always
welcome here, Ben.

04:19.428 --> 04:21.754
Flash: After all this time,

04:22.035 --> 04:24.675
it was you, Scarlet.
Aunt May: What?

04:24.855 --> 04:27.582
You know, Maybe I'm
the only one who isn't surprised.

04:29.582 --> 04:31.253
Flash, what's going on?

04:31.347 --> 04:33.424
Why don't you
tell us, Scarlet?

04:33.470 --> 04:35.793
I don't have time for this.

04:35.925 --> 04:38.144
I gotta help
Spider-Man stop Ock.

04:38.785 --> 04:39.981
Pete pulled me aside

04:40.027 --> 04:41.532
and said that if anyone
comes for that key,

04:41.567 --> 04:43.701
I had to stop 'em.

04:43.736 --> 04:46.403
So consider yourself
stopped!

04:46.439 --> 04:47.589
Punk.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.222
What a sight.

04:53.268 --> 04:56.339
Spider-Man at
his breaking point.

04:56.549 --> 04:59.300
If you think you've pushed
Spider-Man to his limit,

04:59.346 --> 05:02.206
wait till you see what
Peter Parker is capable of!

05:02.261 --> 05:03.654
(Grunting)

05:06.339 --> 05:07.636
(Screaming)

05:12.479 --> 05:16.400
Such a shame your innocent aunt
had to be pulled into this.

05:16.464 --> 05:19.628
But you've stood in my way
too Many times, Parker.

05:19.722 --> 05:22.769
Think of her as
collateral damage.

05:22.854 --> 05:25.745
No! You won't touch her!

05:27.760 --> 05:29.064
(SCREAMS)

05:29.159 --> 05:31.136
(Struggling)

05:31.206 --> 05:33.401
Oh, I've never seen
you so passionate.

05:33.447 --> 05:34.761
Have I struck a nerve?

05:34.808 --> 05:36.553
(Grunting)

05:38.440 --> 05:41.112
This victory is even
greater than I imagined.

05:44.104 --> 05:47.214
Look, Flash, I'm not gonna
lose a battle against Ock

05:47.260 --> 05:48.987
because you want
to play sheriff.

05:49.042 --> 05:51.589
Trust me.
Peter sent me for this key.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.019
If that's true,
why didn't he tell me?

05:54.112 --> 05:56.948
Well, he's a little busy trying
to save the world at the moment.

05:57.136 --> 05:58.690
Then I'm calling him.

05:58.768 --> 05:59.839
(GASPS)

05:59.948 --> 06:02.246
(BEEPS)
No!

06:02.281 --> 06:04.215
(GROANS)
Aunt May: Ben!

06:04.383 --> 06:06.027
What's wrong with you?

06:06.184 --> 06:08.316
I don't want to
hurt you, May.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.512
I won't let you
hurt anyone!

06:11.504 --> 06:12.543
(Aunt May gasps)

06:19.668 --> 06:21.840
You are broken, Spider-Man.

06:21.908 --> 06:25.739
Betrayed. Your aunt May
will pay the final price

06:25.785 --> 06:27.902
and it's entirely your fault.

06:28.074 --> 06:29.763
Any last words?

06:29.809 --> 06:31.442
(Groaning)

06:31.613 --> 06:34.129
I've lost someone to
a criminal before, Ock.

06:34.324 --> 06:35.574
My uncle Ben.

06:36.738 --> 06:39.113
And that's never
gonna happen again!

06:39.230 --> 06:40.676
(YELLS)

06:40.762 --> 06:42.453
(SCREAMS)

06:45.691 --> 06:47.324
(SHOUTS)

06:55.504 --> 06:57.551
I'm sorry I brought
aunt May into this,

06:57.636 --> 06:59.652
but it ends now.

07:01.715 --> 07:03.301
Going somewhere?

07:03.347 --> 07:05.609
Hydro-Man!
Get out of my way!

07:05.684 --> 07:07.988
You think you're
gonna get past me?

07:08.034 --> 07:09.918
I'm a force of nature!

07:09.987 --> 07:12.282
Yeah? Well, so am I!

07:15.543 --> 07:16.715
May's in trouble,

07:16.761 --> 07:19.184
and I'm not gonna
get stopped by H2 O!

07:23.621 --> 07:25.316
(Spider-Man yells)

07:26.488 --> 07:28.131
(GROANS)

07:35.676 --> 07:39.301
Thanks again for freeing me
from my prison, Spider-Man!

07:39.527 --> 07:42.079
(LAUGHS)

07:43.644 --> 07:45.887
I need help.
If you're ever going

07:45.933 --> 07:48.308
to stand up to Ock,
now's the time.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.699
Who are you talking to,
web-for-brains?

07:50.769 --> 07:52.199
You're the only one left!

07:52.245 --> 07:54.098
We're finished here,
Hydro-Man.

07:54.184 --> 07:56.105
Destroy the Triskelion

07:56.144 --> 07:58.441
and everyone in it!

08:00.410 --> 08:02.629
Please. We need your help!

08:02.746 --> 08:04.309
I need your help!

08:07.988 --> 08:10.660
Say Good-Night,
S.H.I.E.L.D. losers!

08:11.559 --> 08:13.191
(LAUGHS)

08:14.280 --> 08:15.512
Whoa!

08:16.223 --> 08:18.527
(GROWLS)
What?

08:18.684 --> 08:20.250
Name's Flint Marko,

08:20.363 --> 08:22.863
but you can
call me Sandman.

08:22.973 --> 08:25.277
S.H.I.E.L.D.
has an elemental too?

08:26.426 --> 08:28.059
Spider-Man's shown me nothing

08:28.105 --> 08:30.082
but respect and compassion.

08:30.254 --> 08:32.019
Can you say the same
for doc Ock?

08:32.073 --> 08:34.090
Compassion's overrated.

08:34.135 --> 08:36.855
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)

08:36.926 --> 08:38.302
(Spits)

08:38.394 --> 08:40.236
Go stop Ock, Spider-Man.

08:40.363 --> 08:42.027
I got this goon.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.407
Thank you, Flint.

08:43.472 --> 08:45.106
(Roars)

08:47.098 --> 08:49.446
I still have a chance
to beat Ock. (Shrieks)

08:49.574 --> 08:52.207
So, Sandman joined
your side, Parker?

08:52.253 --> 08:53.480
Inconsequential!

08:53.559 --> 08:56.926
My Scarlet Spider is
already at your aunt's house.

08:57.016 --> 08:59.762
The key will be mine.

09:00.230 --> 09:01.941
Ben would never
hurt aunt May.

09:01.987 --> 09:03.309
(GROANS)

09:05.168 --> 09:06.613
Ever the optimist.

09:06.683 --> 09:08.871
That is why you have failed.

09:11.691 --> 09:13.303
(Wheelchair firing)

09:13.426 --> 09:16.894
Traitor! No one betrays
Spidey while I'm around!

09:18.480 --> 09:20.574
I've had enough
of you, punk!

09:27.863 --> 09:30.809
Outta my way!
Aunt May: Ben, stop!

09:30.965 --> 09:32.301
You're better than this.

09:32.348 --> 09:34.391
I know I wasn't
wrong about you.

09:34.465 --> 09:36.246
You don't understand.

09:39.363 --> 09:41.660
The doctor is in!

09:43.855 --> 09:45.268
(GROANS)

09:45.304 --> 09:46.827
Flash!

09:47.867 --> 09:51.041
Hello, aunt May.

09:51.328 --> 09:53.243
(SCREAMS)

09:54.316 --> 09:55.605
Ock.

09:57.349 --> 09:59.082
(YELLS)
(GROANS)

09:59.239 --> 10:00.856
You better not
have touched her, Ben!

10:00.910 --> 10:03.192
We just need
that key, Parker.

10:03.254 --> 10:06.293
Why are you doing this?
You know Ock's evil.

10:06.379 --> 10:08.301
You've seen what he's done.

10:09.598 --> 10:12.395
(Both Grunting)

10:17.692 --> 10:19.574
(GROANS)

10:19.746 --> 10:22.215
Scarlet Spider:  Ock rescued me
when no one else cared!

10:22.278 --> 10:25.121
Like your uncle Ben,
he made me who I am.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.840
I owe him everything!

10:26.933 --> 10:29.050
Then I hope this is
everything you wanted.

10:33.285 --> 10:35.028
(Dr.Octopus Grunting)

10:35.154 --> 10:36.426
(GASPS)

10:37.289 --> 10:40.490
My dear lady,
why the rush?

10:40.590 --> 10:42.492
Let's get to know
one another.

10:42.629 --> 10:44.262
You're not my type.

10:44.308 --> 10:45.582
(Spider-Man yells)
(GROANS)

10:54.004 --> 10:55.472
(GASPS)
No!

10:55.518 --> 10:57.168
(Screaming)

11:01.137 --> 11:02.754
Spider-Man:  Don't do it!

11:02.871 --> 11:05.396
It disturbs me how
difficult you found it

11:05.442 --> 11:08.067
to get this key
from an old woman.

11:08.223 --> 11:09.551
I'm sorry.

11:11.356 --> 11:13.457
(Weapon powering up)

11:17.301 --> 11:20.035
Finally, my bonds will be broken.

11:29.074 --> 11:30.340
(People Chattering)

11:33.098 --> 11:34.411
What is he doing?

11:34.465 --> 11:35.895
Spider-Man:
That looks like...

11:35.941 --> 11:37.874
Oh, no!
Hydra Island!

11:43.668 --> 11:45.301
(Grunting)

11:46.358 --> 11:47.621
(GROANS)

11:50.395 --> 11:52.462
I wanted to stay
out of this war.

11:52.848 --> 11:56.074
Then I got an idea.
Why don't you?

11:56.192 --> 11:57.334
'Cause unlike you,

11:57.395 --> 12:00.043
I'm loyal
to the right side!

12:00.153 --> 12:01.567
(GASPS) What?

12:13.176 --> 12:16.019
Sorry to ruin your island
getaway, Dr. Ego-Pus!

12:16.054 --> 12:17.606
(Grunting)

12:22.129 --> 12:25.528
Even as you lose, you can't stop
making lame jokes.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.661
I have been looking forward
to this moment

12:29.707 --> 12:33.793
ever since Scarlet stole
Dr. Connors' research for me.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.172
Did Connors ever tell you

12:35.218 --> 12:37.793
what this weapon
truly does, Spider-Man?

12:45.168 --> 12:46.416
I'll tell you what
it doesn't do.

12:46.528 --> 12:49.186
Make Octopus doctors
any less annoying!

12:51.981 --> 12:53.551
(Both grunting)

12:56.395 --> 12:59.114
It is capable of
manipulating the nanobots

12:59.168 --> 13:00.981
that make up Hydra Island.

13:01.066 --> 13:03.442
Allowing me not only
to control it,

13:03.598 --> 13:07.098
but also manipulate it
into my own image.

13:07.168 --> 13:11.637
Allow me to present
Octopus Island.

13:15.410 --> 13:17.559
(All screaming)

13:26.207 --> 13:28.825
Spider-Man: Just what
we need, more potholes.

13:28.887 --> 13:30.360
(Dr.Octopus laughing)

13:30.395 --> 13:33.356
You can't save them all,
Spider-Man.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.364
Dr.Octopus: Behold
what we have wrought!

13:40.489 --> 13:42.439
Is it not beautiful?

13:42.474 --> 13:45.377
It is just as I said
it would be.

13:45.479 --> 13:47.143
With you at my side,

13:47.237 --> 13:50.280
Otto octavius shall rule all!

13:51.260 --> 13:52.565
(Screaming)

13:53.768 --> 13:55.452
(GASPS)
I've got ya!

13:55.627 --> 13:57.947
What type of person
would do this?

13:58.104 --> 14:00.290
It's not very friendly
or neighborly, is it?

14:00.354 --> 14:03.026
Spider-Man,
Flash is still in there!

14:05.627 --> 14:07.397
(SCREAMS)
No!

14:16.124 --> 14:17.807
(Grunting)
Flash, buddy,

14:17.862 --> 14:19.908
now would be a good time
to wake up!  - (Groaning)

14:22.268 --> 14:23.565
Oh!

14:26.869 --> 14:28.674
No!

14:29.197 --> 14:30.666
Dr.Octopus:
It is done.

14:30.846 --> 14:32.838
My greatest enemy destroyed

14:32.884 --> 14:36.307
by his pathetic responsibility
to help others.

14:36.549 --> 14:38.401
Almost poetic.

14:39.898 --> 14:42.315
(SIGHS) Peter.

14:44.002 --> 14:46.026
(GRUNTS)

14:46.088 --> 14:48.221
(GASPS)
Spider-Man!

14:48.296 --> 14:51.524
Spider-Man:  Proportionate strength
of a Spider... Blah, blah, blah.

14:51.617 --> 14:53.321
Can you get Flash out of here?

14:58.621 --> 14:59.988
(Moaning)

15:00.066 --> 15:01.379
This I can do.

15:01.447 --> 15:03.512
Only you can stop that.

15:04.973 --> 15:06.519
(Mechanical whirring)

15:08.014 --> 15:09.230
(GRUNTS)

15:17.332 --> 15:21.622
Finally, my Octopus Island
is complete. Scarlet?

15:21.668 --> 15:23.083
A credit to
your brilliance.

15:23.129 --> 15:25.825
Zola: Octavius.
(Static crackling)

15:25.997 --> 15:27.575
Dr.Octopus: Ah, yes,

15:27.621 --> 15:29.821
another foe to finish off.

15:29.989 --> 15:33.466
You dare betray Hydra?

15:33.638 --> 15:35.651
You tried to control me, Zola.

15:35.729 --> 15:37.511
A dangerous experiment.

15:37.557 --> 15:39.159
This is the result.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.042
You will not...
(GROANS)

15:41.789 --> 15:42.855
(GRUNTS)

15:45.147 --> 15:46.799
Hydra is mine.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.768
Spider-Man
is destroyed.

15:48.815 --> 15:52.307
Dr. Otto octavius
is finally vict... (SCREAMS)

15:53.487 --> 15:55.011
Spider-Man's destroyed?

15:55.112 --> 15:56.557
As a scientist,
I'd think you'd be

15:56.603 --> 15:58.260
more thorough
with your research.

15:58.319 --> 15:59.456
(SCREAMS)

16:03.956 --> 16:05.214
(Both Grunting)

16:06.393 --> 16:08.370
You don't have to do this!

16:08.557 --> 16:11.401
You, of all people,
should understand loyalty.

16:11.456 --> 16:14.941
I do. I know it's something
you earn, not damand.

16:15.026 --> 16:16.209
(GRUNTS)

16:16.255 --> 16:17.893
This ends now, Ock.

16:18.034 --> 16:20.909
Finally,
we agree on something.

16:22.378 --> 16:23.846
(GASPS)

16:24.096 --> 16:25.143
No!

16:25.214 --> 16:26.292
May.

16:26.425 --> 16:27.518
Leave her alone!

16:28.056 --> 16:29.856
(Grunting)

16:37.503 --> 16:39.933
(Spider-Man Groaning)
(Laughing)

16:41.792 --> 16:43.909
Ben, help him!

16:45.073 --> 16:47.894
This has always been
your weakness,

16:47.940 --> 16:50.580
your attachment
to other people.

16:50.651 --> 16:53.179
Don't you... (GROANS)

16:53.307 --> 16:56.697
Care about anyone
or anything, Ock?

16:56.744 --> 16:59.611
Unlike you, I have
the discipline of mind

16:59.657 --> 17:02.963
to not be bogged down
by petty emotions.

17:07.002 --> 17:10.143
Not even Scarlet Spider?
Your greatest creation?

17:10.198 --> 17:13.933
He's a successful servant that fulfills
his purpose, nothing more.

17:16.907 --> 17:19.846
A final lesson
in the dangers of compassion,

17:19.979 --> 17:22.976
Scarlet, you do
the honors.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.549
Finish him.

17:29.088 --> 17:31.755
(GRUNTS) Peter!

17:33.385 --> 17:36.010
I can't believe your time
with us meant nothing, Ben.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.891
Believe what you want.

17:38.760 --> 17:39.893
(GRUNTS)

17:42.877 --> 17:45.174
(GASPS)
What have you done?

17:45.233 --> 17:46.932
Betraying me?

17:47.026 --> 17:49.986
Ever the pathetic
disappointment, Scarlet!

17:51.322 --> 17:53.291
My name

17:53.533 --> 17:55.635
is Ben Reilly.

17:56.229 --> 17:58.541
I made you!

17:58.613 --> 18:00.947
But they made
me who I am.

18:03.768 --> 18:04.984
(Yelling)

18:06.121 --> 18:07.954
(Dr.Octopus screaming)

18:11.229 --> 18:12.494
We gotta get
out of here.

18:12.994 --> 18:14.432
(Sneers)

18:15.924 --> 18:17.230
(Island crashing)

18:22.322 --> 18:25.772
Otto Octavius doesn't need
the help of anyone else!

18:28.791 --> 18:30.010
Are you okay,
aunt May?

18:30.072 --> 18:32.361
I am, but what
about the ship?

18:32.533 --> 18:34.034
Without Ock
to control this thing,

18:34.080 --> 18:35.359
it's gonna fall
out of the sky,

18:35.507 --> 18:36.976
and onto New York.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.023
We have to get
to an escape pod.

18:40.695 --> 18:42.030
(GASPS)
What?

18:42.085 --> 18:43.593
Hurry up, punk.

18:43.679 --> 18:45.992
Ben? What are
you doing? Get in!

18:46.135 --> 18:48.697
Someone has to make sure
this Island comes down safely.

18:48.869 --> 18:50.736
An impact would
take out half the city.

18:50.782 --> 18:51.893
I can help you!

18:51.939 --> 18:53.603
You already have.

18:53.789 --> 18:55.182
Keep May safe.

18:56.049 --> 18:57.904
Ben!

19:08.121 --> 19:09.859
Sandman: Gotcha!

19:10.629 --> 19:11.951
Enough!

19:12.804 --> 19:14.153
(GRUNTS)

19:14.226 --> 19:15.889
Hydro-Man: No!

19:18.193 --> 19:19.993
(GROANS)

19:22.144 --> 19:24.130
Sorry for the bumpy landing.

19:24.165 --> 19:26.707
I was a little occupied.

19:32.949 --> 19:34.504
Aunt May,
you're safe here.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.260
Cho, call the Spider-jet.

19:36.471 --> 19:38.948
- It's not too late to save Ben!
- I'm on it!

19:45.854 --> 19:47.120
Faster, Cho!

19:47.155 --> 19:49.055
The engines are
deep in the red!

19:52.994 --> 19:54.213
(Grunting)

20:01.448 --> 20:03.760
<i>Coming for you.
Get topside.</i>

20:03.995 --> 20:05.815
You know it's too late
for that, Peter.

20:05.874 --> 20:08.190
Tell me, is this
what he would do?

20:08.659 --> 20:09.698
Who?

20:09.768 --> 20:11.932
<i>The other Ben.
The one I'm named after.</i>

20:11.987 --> 20:14.440
Yeah. I guess it is.

20:15.331 --> 20:17.387
<i>He'd give anything
to save people.</i>

20:18.186 --> 20:20.053
Peter, Ock was wrong.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.855
Compassion isn't
your greatest weakness.

20:23.892 --> 20:25.892
It's your greatest strength.

20:25.927 --> 20:27.327
<i>Keep being a hero.</i>

20:27.362 --> 20:29.162
(Chuckles)
<i>Punk.</i>

20:30.932 --> 20:31.965
No!

20:35.610 --> 20:37.070
(Explosion)

20:44.280 --> 20:47.281
Scanning. Scanning.
(Machine computing)

20:47.349 --> 20:50.040
Come on. Nothing.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.618
(Spider-Man gasps)

20:51.664 --> 20:54.017
Can't find him. Anything?

20:54.222 --> 20:56.561
No. That was
my tenth scan.

20:56.607 --> 20:57.882
Not a single life sign.

20:58.868 --> 21:01.836
(GASPS) No luck.

21:02.085 --> 21:03.983
Keep trying.
I'm going down.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.397
Peter!

21:05.460 --> 21:06.733
(GRUNTS)
Peter.

21:06.811 --> 21:08.134
He's gone.

21:18.343 --> 21:21.085
Spidey, what
do we do now?

21:22.889 --> 21:24.250
I'm not sure.

21:24.382 --> 21:25.811
But the one thing
we can do

21:25.857 --> 21:27.577
is what he said.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.577
We keep being heroes.

21:29.671 --> 21:31.024
Like Ben Reilly.
