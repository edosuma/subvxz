WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:14.890
Agent MacLaren never did
explain before they left how my...

00:14.973 --> 00:17.768
teapot got smashed.
I don't suppose you...

00:19.061 --> 00:20.771
Yeah. Doesn't matter.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.731
I just dipped the bags in the cups.

00:22.815 --> 00:23.982
Careful, that's hot.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.151
What is this?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.445
Really?

00:29.446 --> 00:31.699
Wow. It's, uh... It's tea.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.743
He said you wouldn't remember the events
of the last few months, but I...

00:34.827 --> 00:36.369
didn't expect that.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.376
It's good. I like it.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.462
Yeah, I know you do.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.923
Blow on it, though, so you don't...

00:48.006 --> 00:49.216
burn your tongue.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.929
So this experimental procedure
that they gave you...

00:54.012 --> 00:56.014
uh, what was that all about?

00:56.765 --> 00:59.392
-Did it hurt?
-I... I can't tell you that.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.604
Because you don't remember.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.981
I don't, actually,

01:04.064 --> 01:06.066
but that's not why I can't tell you.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.276
Because it's a secret.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.486
That part you remember.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.406
All right, you know, it doesn't matter.
It worked.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.201
And to be honest, Marcy, I'm just...

01:17.369 --> 01:18.996
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.331
Why can't you tell me?

01:23.667 --> 01:24.960
Oh...

01:25.043 --> 01:26.461
Well, I can.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.215
What did MacLaren tell you about me?

01:31.383 --> 01:33.093
Uh, everything.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.930
That you knew me on a professional level
while I was undercover,

01:37.014 --> 01:40.433
but that we were friends now.
I've been staying here temporarily.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.019
And that's it?

01:42.686 --> 01:46.439
There wasn't really that much time
to brief me before you came home.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.025
Yeah. No. I just...

01:50.360 --> 01:51.779
Yeah.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.241
He said the most important thing
was that we were close.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.994
And that I can trust you.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.333
When I was in college,

02:05.417 --> 02:08.586
I learned all about amnesia
in one of my courses.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.051
I don't remember which course,
ironically...

02:15.302 --> 02:18.263
but I do remember learning
that in a lot of cases,

02:18.346 --> 02:19.765
memories come back.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.604
That's what I'm hoping for.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.319
Charlotte, what's wrong?
Did you have a bad dream?

03:20.325 --> 03:23.078
It's all right. Your mom's here.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.165
Charlotte?

03:34.673 --> 03:37.968
Charlotte?
Is everything all right in there?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.344
No.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.765
You should come in.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.999
What are you doing here?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.293
Hi. Thought we could, uh...

04:12.627 --> 04:16.673
work out together, and then...
go somewhere for breakfast.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.717
No, Grant. I mean,
what are you doing here?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.263
What do you mean? I wanted to see you.
What's wrong with that?

04:26.558 --> 04:28.435
I'm not doing this here.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.062
Doing what?

04:30.145 --> 04:32.355
Step off that thing for a second.
Come on, let's... let's talk.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.441
Oh, now you want to talk?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.276
What happened?
Did she break it off?

04:36.359 --> 04:38.653
-What? Who?
-Don't insult me.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.989
What's her name?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.826
You want to do this here? Fine.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.203
What's her name, Grant?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.413
You want to talk,
let's start the conversation with that.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.542
How did you know?

04:59.132 --> 05:03.511
I didn't, really, not for sure,
but I guess I do now.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.138
Kat, I...

05:05.222 --> 05:08.308
If you want to know when,
it was the last time we had sex,

05:08.391 --> 05:10.143
after your surprise party.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.896
At the time, all I could think of was,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.816
"Wow, where the hell
did he learn how to do that?"

05:15.899 --> 05:19.486
Then afterwards, I realized
there was obviously only one explanation.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.365
It was like you were making love
to a different person.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.950
You were a different person.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.702
-How do you think that made me feel?
-In a way, I was.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.414
All I can tell you is that I'm here now.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.917
And I wanna stay.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.213
I'm not sure I want you to.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.522
David?

05:55.605 --> 05:56.648
Yes?

05:56.731 --> 06:00.027
-Oh... hey.
-What are these from?

06:00.944 --> 06:03.780
Uh... what am I looking at?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.823
These scars on my chest and my neck.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.117
These wounds are fresh,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.701
and it looks like
it was done by a scalpel.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.245
Right. Yeah.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.247
You, uh...

06:12.330 --> 06:14.749
You performed minor surgery on yourself,

06:14.832 --> 06:18.921
installed something called
a vagus nerve stimulator,

06:19.004 --> 06:20.672
supposed to help
with the seizures you were having.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.549
Uh, by myself?

06:22.632 --> 06:23.967
Why would I do that?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.843
Yeah. That's what I said.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.516
VNS therapy would have never worked
in the case of pre-existing damage.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.519
Yeah, that's what you said.
Right after.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.354
I was apoplectic.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.565
There was blood everywhere.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.567
Obviously, I took it out.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.069
The only thing that seemed to help,

06:42.152 --> 06:44.988
or at least bought you time,
was the, uh...

06:45.072 --> 06:46.323
lumbar punctures.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.286
You made some sort of serum
out of the fluid.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.788
I couldn't have done that by myself.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.082
You didn't.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.875
I helped.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.046
Do you mind if I have some coffee
before we continue this conversation?

07:01.129 --> 07:03.923
Do you have any medical training?

07:04.007 --> 07:06.259
Nope. You taught me.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.636
Do you remember coffee? Do you...

07:08.720 --> 07:10.180
Do you want some coffee?

07:12.265 --> 07:15.435
If those treatments
really did buy me time, then...

07:17.270 --> 07:19.147
I owe you my life.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.316
No. You don't owe me anything.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.987
You could do me a favor, though.
You could... You could...

07:26.071 --> 07:29.616
You could do up one or...
two of those buttons

07:29.699 --> 07:31.701
on that shirt that I laid out
for today, which, that...

07:31.784 --> 07:32.869
I mean, that's fine.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.871
Is it bothering you?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.457
Bother's the wrong word.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.542
Better?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.754
I don't know.

07:46.549 --> 07:50.095
David... were we intimate?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.058
See, the thing about that is...

07:55.142 --> 07:57.019
you'd only have my word to go by,

07:57.102 --> 07:59.479
which forces my inner boy scout
to not take advantage.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.160
If that was a test, that wasn't fair,
'cause I wasn't ready.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.079
That was to thank you for helping me.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.375
I thought maybe you remembered something.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.754
Oh, there... there is one thing.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.464
What? What is it?

08:27.382 --> 08:28.841
That you're a reporter.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.099
A social worker.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.312
- But that's okay.
- We'll work on it.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.778
I'm here.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.030
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

08:50.113 --> 08:51.656
<i>- I need your help.</i>
- What is it?

08:51.739 --> 08:52.949
<i>It's Jeff. He's...</i>

08:53.033 --> 08:55.368
I've left you messages about this.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.412
He's got me backed into a corner.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.913
He wants custody of my son.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.208
-Your son?
<i>-Yes.</i>

09:01.291 --> 09:03.335
What do you want me
to do about it?

09:03.418 --> 09:04.627
Talk to him. With...

09:04.711 --> 09:07.422
with your position at the FBI,
you can... You can help--

09:07.505 --> 09:10.175
I spoke to Jeff, Carly.
Or rather, he spoke to me.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.926
-At work.
<i>-He did?</i>

09:12.009 --> 09:14.011
God, I want to bury that man.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.181
<i>You need to get this situation</i>
<i>under control.</i>

09:16.264 --> 09:17.390
That's why I need your help.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.976
Does Trevor call me every time
he's got trouble with his parents?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.145
No, but you don't sleep with Trevor,
do you?

09:24.814 --> 09:29.277
Fight your own battles, Carly,
just like the rest of us.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.242
And then Rene said that all my pictures

09:35.325 --> 09:38.286
should have
hashtag, boob job won't fix this on them.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.497
So... you didn't retaliate?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.290
What?

09:42.374 --> 09:46.043
This is your problem exactly.
You let people walk all over you.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.962
You need to establish dominance.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.882
Next time Rene says something to you,
disparage her home life.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.717
Her mother's had a DUI.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.470
Alternatively,
you can just accept the fact

09:55.553 --> 09:57.264
that you're less attractive
and uninteresting.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.849
That option may even be more realistic.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.108
Uh... I'm gonna go...

10:08.191 --> 10:09.401
Good talk.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.660
Um, Ms. Day, can I talk to you
for a minute?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.995
Let's not pretend I have a choice.
What is it?

10:21.078 --> 10:24.081
Um, I have some forms for a field trip
I need your signature on.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.375
Shouldn't your parents fill those out?

10:26.376 --> 10:27.544
They're dead.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.753
What?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.798
Jesus.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.111
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

10:54.821 --> 10:57.657
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
Hey! What are you doing?

11:01.911 --> 11:03.913
- She tried to kill me!
- I can tell!

11:05.582 --> 11:07.917
Let me go!
I'm on a mission!

11:15.174 --> 11:17.260
- Go after her!
- And do what? She's a kid!

11:17.344 --> 11:19.804
-A kid who tried to stab me to death!
-Why? What'd you do?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.889
What did I do?
There's something more going on here.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.934
-What?
-I can't stay here. She'll be back.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.644
-I have to get to Ellis.
-No, no!

11:26.728 --> 11:28.271
You're not going anywhere just yet.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.398
Guys, it's Trevor.
We have to meet up at ops.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.359
A traveler just tried to kill Grace.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.033
Sorry.
I had a hard time finding the place.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.410
I should have picked you up.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.662
It's fine. I'm here now.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.831
Not a single SOS that I can see.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.251
Maybe she was just targeting you.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.460
Of course she was targeting me.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.045
Are you sure it wasn't just a student
with a bone to pick?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.506
No, I was there.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.467
You remember the family
who had their historian misfire?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.010
I'm pretty sure it was the daughter.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.721
The girl I took to her grandma's house?

12:02.597 --> 12:03.723
Don't look at me.

12:03.806 --> 12:04.891
Charlotte.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.184
She said she was on a mission.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.396
She was taken as a host anyway.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.148
Why would the director want you dead?

12:12.231 --> 12:13.941
The director didn't send her.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.985
I've already told you,
there's a faction in the future--

12:16.068 --> 12:19.071
No one but the director
has the capability to send travelers.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.240
Tell them what you did.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.076
Tell them! Or I will.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.249
I reset the director.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.334
What?

12:32.544 --> 12:34.462
Rebooted its OS through a virus

12:34.546 --> 12:37.507
in order to protect it
from corruption by the faction.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.635
What would they say in the 21st? Uh...

12:40.718 --> 12:43.346
"Control, alt, delete."

12:43.430 --> 12:45.264
That's impossible.

12:45.348 --> 12:48.601
Well, the director is a highly advanced
quantum AI program

12:48.685 --> 12:51.938
and I'm the lead programmer,
so, no, not impossible.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.650
You reset an AI that's been running
every facet of our lives

12:55.733 --> 12:59.111
since long before I was born,
and not to mention every mission--

12:59.195 --> 13:00.613
Before you were born, maybe.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.240
But not me.
I helped create it.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.284
-No one else could've done it.
-How?

13:06.160 --> 13:09.372
She uploaded a command
while pretending to save Marcy's life.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.291
How?

13:13.501 --> 13:17.129
When she saw my code,
it was sent back as visual information

13:17.213 --> 13:20.550
through the quantum bridge created
during transfer of consciousness.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.344
You mean you used me?

13:22.427 --> 13:25.555
I saved you,
and I'm saving the director.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.641
Where is the gratitude?
What is wrong with you people?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.352
What's happening in the future
while it's offline?

13:30.435 --> 13:32.269
Chaos, probably.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.939
A temporary power struggle.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.361
The faction doesn't believe
in the grand plan.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.739
Even before Helios had basically
no effect on the future,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.116
they had already started a mission
to abandon ship.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.202
Your team knows firsthand
the brutality they're capable of.

13:48.285 --> 13:51.414
You mean they're the ones
who put us in those cages?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.375
Tortured us?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.668
To test your loyalty...
and to make sure

13:55.752 --> 13:57.587
you couldn't complete a mission
they disagreed with.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.298
That was the first real proof I had

14:01.383 --> 14:04.135
that they'd managed to implement
some of their agenda.

14:05.428 --> 14:08.347
So I came back here
into the 21st to stop them.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.809
What do we do now?

14:11.893 --> 14:14.604
The director will come back online
more secure than ever,

14:14.687 --> 14:16.981
and soon,
everything will go back to normal.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.734
"Thank you for saving us, Grace."

14:27.784 --> 14:29.411
Please take me to Ellis...

14:29.494 --> 14:32.163
before one of you gets overwritten
and tries to kill me.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.081
What makes you think you'll be safe there?

14:34.165 --> 14:36.083
He's taken precautions.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.211
Boss?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.633
Yeah, get her outta here.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.053
But don't let her out of your sight.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.439
"Thank you for saving us, Grace!"

15:56.623 --> 15:57.915
Is this yours?

16:00.585 --> 16:01.753
Uh...

16:03.087 --> 16:04.421
Yeah.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.216
I inherited it from my host.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.511
Historical record was wrong.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.472
You know, we should spend
some more time debriefing you.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.973
-There are a lot of--
-What?

16:14.056 --> 16:16.476
You just kept taking it?

16:16.559 --> 16:19.979
You were helping me wean off it,
but I had a little bit of a setback.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.815
Well, we're starting again.
No more than eight units.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.151
If you take more than that,
it's because you want it.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.360
And I won't stand for that.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.195
And from now on...

16:28.279 --> 16:30.322
I'm keeping track of how much you dose.

16:31.866 --> 16:32.950
You're the doctor.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.244
And you're the historian.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.996
We need your mind clear.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.971
Ellis!

16:55.264 --> 16:56.516
Ellis!

17:02.146 --> 17:03.355
Ellis!

17:03.439 --> 17:05.692
Ellis!

17:07.151 --> 17:09.278
- Where is he?
- Not here.

17:18.705 --> 17:24.251
So you are gonna be hanging
with the babysitter today.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.377
Huh?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.472
Just gonna hang tight, little man,

17:36.556 --> 17:39.726
and I'll come back and get you
after work, okay?

17:39.809 --> 17:40.935
Hmm?

17:41.018 --> 17:44.689
You wanna fly?
You wanna fly?

17:44.772 --> 17:46.398
Hey, it's okay.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.442
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.111
Hey, guys.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.484
You okay?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.487
Are you...

18:34.739 --> 18:36.407
- okay?
- I'm fine.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.870
I had no choice.
She was gonna shoot you.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.040
-Yeah, she was.
-You saw that, right?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.752
Carly, what the fuck are you doin'?

18:47.835 --> 18:49.921
Carly! You need to stay put!

18:50.004 --> 18:51.255
Carly!

18:51.338 --> 18:52.548
Carly!

19:19.867 --> 19:22.286
Where the hell were you?
It's dangerous out there!

19:22.369 --> 19:24.664
I had to run out for a few supplies.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.341
What do you want now?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.635
The faction sent
an assassin after me.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.179
Not a very good one, apparently.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.765
Oh, fortunately,
I was there to stop her.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.101
-Where?
-At the school.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.853
Any of 'em follow you?

19:46.936 --> 19:49.230
We're alone.
You can stop worrying about yourself.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.319
Were you a part of the reset, too?

19:55.402 --> 19:57.238
-Reset?
-Of the director?

19:58.655 --> 20:00.574
-That is too far.
-It was the only way.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.159
Not by a long shot!

20:02.243 --> 20:04.411
My God, the ego of this woman.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.623
When?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.584
When I sat Marcy down at your computer.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.669
Right in front of me.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.966
-Give me a hand with this.
-What is all this?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.723
Are these SQUID transistors?

20:23.806 --> 20:27.601
You think you're the only one
who figured out what the faction is up to?

20:27.684 --> 20:29.061
Look, have a little faith.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.522
The director had its own contingency,

20:31.605 --> 20:33.690
although you've probably screwed
that all up.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.984
Wait, what contingency?

20:36.443 --> 20:38.821
Me... and this.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.087
I was sent back to assemble this.

21:05.890 --> 21:09.769
The director's had teams working
on core elements for months.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.147
First components arrived
the day I came back to the 21st.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.858
-This is a quantum frame.
-Yes, it is.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.778
If things get bad enough
that the director has no choice

21:18.861 --> 21:22.531
but to escape the faction,
it can send itself here to the 21st.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.922
Agent MacLaren.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.507
Officer Boyd.
How can I help...

21:40.591 --> 21:42.927
Jesus, what are you doing?

21:43.010 --> 21:44.678
-What'd you do?
-What?

21:44.761 --> 21:47.389
What did you do that would make
the director give an order to kill you?

21:47.473 --> 21:49.433
How did you receive the order?

21:49.516 --> 21:51.560
By messenger.
Don't change the subject.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.728
What did you do?

21:52.812 --> 21:55.647
I think you already know
I didn't do anything wrong,

21:55.731 --> 21:57.608
or we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.693
Your orders didn't come from the director.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.238
-What does that mean?
-What was the message exactly?

22:02.321 --> 22:05.407
"Kill 3468," so not a lot of room
for interpretation.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.953
Another traveler I know had an attempt
made on her life earlier today.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.412
By who, if not the director?

22:10.496 --> 22:13.207
According to her,
another faction from the future.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.876
I don't know about any faction.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.293
Well, neither do I...

22:16.377 --> 22:18.545
but apparently,
things have changed since we left,

22:18.629 --> 22:19.839
and not for the better.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.049
That's not good enough.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.550
It's all I got.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.677
I only know what she told me.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.803
That's a problem.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.185
It doesn't have to be.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.438
-Does it?
-Yeah.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.232
It does.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.028
Take a step back.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.864
Take a step back, MacLaren!

23:29.283 --> 23:30.576
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Marce.</i>

23:30.659 --> 23:31.493
David?

23:31.577 --> 23:34.163
I'm glad you recognize my voice.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.290
So here's something awkward...

23:36.373 --> 23:38.750
There's a man in my apartment
who's looking for you,

23:38.834 --> 23:40.336
and he has a gun.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.421
Has he hurt you?

23:42.504 --> 23:44.173
<i>Uh... little bit.</i>

23:44.966 --> 23:48.052
<i>A little bit,</i>
<i>but he said he'd do a lot more</i>

23:48.135 --> 23:50.096
if I didn't phone you right away.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.930
He did point the gun nozzle...

23:54.016 --> 23:57.478
You know, I know it's not "nozzle,"
but I can't think of the word right now.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.063
I wanna say barrel?

24:00.897 --> 24:02.274
You know, it's not coming to me,

24:02.358 --> 24:03.942
but he's got it pointed
at the back of my head

24:04.026 --> 24:05.611
<i>right now, so if you can imagine that...</i>

24:07.113 --> 24:09.406
that's what's happening,
and that's why I'm calling you.

24:09.490 --> 24:10.741
Against my will.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.128
Kat.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.337
Grant? What are you doing here?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.381
Sorry to just show up like this,
but it's important.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.384
-How did you find me?
-I'm FBI.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.012
And I need you to go home right now,
pack a bag,

24:31.095 --> 24:32.929
go to your mother's for a few days,
maybe a week.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.265
What? What's going on?

24:34.348 --> 24:36.475
-I'm dealing with a situation at work.
-Work?

24:36.558 --> 24:38.935
-It's not safe.
-Tell me what's happening.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.687
-I can't.
-Are you safe?

24:40.771 --> 24:43.399
Look, I know it's not
the ideal time for me

24:43.482 --> 24:47.236
to make demands of you,
but I need you to do as I ask.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.321
If something happened to you
because of me...

24:50.447 --> 24:51.782
I don't know what I'd do.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.535
-You're serious.
-Yes.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.538
All right, don't worry about me.
I'll go right now.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.665
Just tell me that
you're gonna be all right.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.252
I'll walk you to your car.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.587
Come on.

25:06.755 --> 25:10.092
Carly, where the hell are you?

25:10.176 --> 25:11.593
I am in some serious shit.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.012
I need you to meet me down at the station
and help me.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.973
You were the only witness

25:17.058 --> 25:20.018
that saw that I killed that girl
to save you!

25:21.687 --> 25:23.897
You just can't run off
to leave me to deal with this!

25:25.149 --> 25:26.400
Call me back.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.312
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.147
-I'm here about your east wall.
-What?

26:05.231 --> 26:06.815
The building manager notified you, yes?

26:06.898 --> 26:09.610
I just need your cooperation
for a couple minutes, okay?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.528
-Building manager?
-Yeah. He should have contacted you.

26:11.612 --> 26:12.863
I just need you to step aside
for a moment,

26:12.946 --> 26:15.407
and I will be
out of your way soon, okay?

26:33.884 --> 26:35.719
Hello?

26:44.353 --> 26:47.231
Answer it.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.862
-Hey, Marce?
-Duck.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.989
-What?
-Duck down now.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.375
Oh, God.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.963
Oh, God.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.052
Marce?

27:17.928 --> 27:20.055
Marcy? You shot him.

27:20.138 --> 27:23.350
What did you expect me to do?
He was gonna kill you right after me.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.478
I need you to go somewhere else
for a couple nights, until it's safe.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.021
Okay?

27:28.104 --> 27:30.065
Go somewhere?

27:30.148 --> 27:33.610
Marcy, there's a dead guy
on my living room floor!

27:34.778 --> 27:36.572
I gotta call the police.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.325
If you insist on bringing them
into this...

27:39.408 --> 27:42.035
I need you to tell them that
you don't know where the shot came from.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.331
-You want me to lie?
-No, David.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.998
I want you to go somewhere safe,

27:47.082 --> 27:49.793
but if you're gonna bring the police
into this then, yes, lie.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.755
We'll have to cover this up later.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.216
I need to go.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.593
Marcy?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.767
<i>Hello. You've reached</i>
<i>the confidential voicemail</i>

28:05.851 --> 28:07.228
<i>of Special Agent Forbes.</i>

28:07.311 --> 28:09.938
<i>Please leave a detailed message,</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

28:11.189 --> 28:14.235
Hey, Walt, it's Kat again.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.363
I'm sorry to keep calling,
but I really need to talk to you.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.823
What's going on?
I'm worried.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.325
Please call me back.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.288
It'll be a tight fit, all right.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.999
Do you even have a plan
for when this is all ready?

28:29.082 --> 28:31.418
I figured I'd flip the switch
and see what happens.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.295
- You would.
- No, this one here.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.505
Plan for what?

28:34.588 --> 28:37.841
For when the director is ready
to send itself here.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.637
As of right now,

28:41.720 --> 28:45.641
this entire farm is protected by
a space-time attenuator field.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.851
Covers the whole farm
in a 100-yard radius.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.311
Nothing will penetrate it.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.147
No electronics, no GPS,
no telemetry of any kind

28:52.231 --> 28:53.649
in the 21st or the future.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.277
So we're invisible
to the faction right now.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.403
And to the director.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.281
It won't be able to send a messenger
or consciousness here,

29:00.364 --> 29:01.573
let alone itself.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.075
As soon as we know the director's
back online, we'll be safe

29:04.159 --> 29:06.202
and we can turn off the defenses.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.914
Then it can either come back to the 21st

29:08.997 --> 29:10.582
or stay where it is.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.334
Either way...

29:12.418 --> 29:14.545
I'll have to feed the pigs
and milk the cow in the morning.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.384
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would the director want

29:20.467 --> 29:21.510
other teams to take each other out?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.136
Maybe Grace was right.
Maybe it's the faction.

29:23.219 --> 29:25.972
Or maybe we're being punished
for helping her.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.601
Sorry, boss, nothing.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.645
No other teams reporting
that they've encountered this.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.730
Everything looks normal on the deep web.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.483
Well, there's nothing to report
if you don't survive.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.820
Trevor, come in.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.029
Trevor?

29:42.072 --> 29:44.157
He could be in danger.
We have to warn him.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.498
Get down!

29:57.421 --> 29:58.797
Go, go, go!

30:24.072 --> 30:25.866
Why are you looking at me like that?

30:27.451 --> 30:29.035
Nothing. No, I'm not.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.914
Don't tell me you had a thing for her.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.166
- Who?
- Who do you think?

30:36.668 --> 30:39.170
Ew, don't tell me that's why
you took her out into the woods.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.340
Grace Day was a lovely human being.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.468
She didn't deserve to die,
that's all it was.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.220
I'd prefer if you'd refer to me
in the present tense.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.141
You know, if you're gonna
go on pretending to be her,

30:51.224 --> 30:52.559
you've got a lot of work to do.

30:52.643 --> 30:53.852
Look who's talking.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.061
What's that supposed to mean?

30:55.145 --> 30:56.980
Your school record says your previous self

30:57.063 --> 30:59.816
was a recalcitrant bully
whose only redeeming quality

30:59.900 --> 31:02.152
was a gift
for something called... football.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.488
Trevor Holden wouldn't have
given Grace the time of day--

31:04.571 --> 31:05.864
She didn't deserve to die.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.074
Oh, but Trevor Holden did?
Is that what you're saying?

31:08.158 --> 31:09.951
Existence should be based on merit?

31:10.035 --> 31:12.621
You're a hypocrite.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.251
How's our progress?

31:19.503 --> 31:21.337
I need to check in with my team.

31:31.765 --> 31:34.350
<i>Just get to the farm.</i>
<i>We'll be right behind you.</i>

31:34.435 --> 31:36.978
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

31:37.062 --> 31:38.814
I left Poppy behind.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.566
-Who's Poppy?
-My turtle.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.943
You mean it belonged to your host?

31:43.026 --> 31:45.236
No, I just bought it as a pet.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.489
You know, for company.

31:48.532 --> 31:49.825
A turtle.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.285
Yeah. That was a lot of gunfire.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.120
What if she got shot?
You think she's gonna be okay?

31:54.204 --> 31:55.414
I do.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.253
You're a little different.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.130
It's weird.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.632
Than what?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.134
The Marcy I know.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.011
Knew.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.347
I don't even know if that's possible.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.311
I'm not saying
that you're not you.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.646
Obviously, you're you.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.607
How... how am I different?

32:22.566 --> 32:26.945
If I had to sum it up into one word,
I would say that Marcy 1.0...

32:27.028 --> 32:28.614
was more fragile.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.411
Maybe because you knew
you were gonna die.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.247
You don't have the same burden.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.917
You don't think it's a burden
coming into a team who already knows you,

32:41.001 --> 32:42.377
but you don't know them?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.463
I mean, other than the time
that you trained together.

32:44.546 --> 32:47.048
-I'm sure it is.
-It's me, Philip.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.343
Just give me some time to catch up.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.770
Mr. Mailer,

32:59.853 --> 33:02.147
I've got someone coming
to escort you to the station

33:02.230 --> 33:03.774
so we can talk further
while the investigation--

33:03.857 --> 33:05.817
I told you,
the shot came outta nowhere.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.945
Well, not nowhere.
It came from your neighbor's apartment.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.655
We're gonna take a statement
from your neighbor.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.448
Maybe she saw someone.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.160
-I don't have anything more to add that--
-You've been under duress.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.913
We're gonna give you
some time to think.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.498
Seriously, I'm fine.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.125
Sir, a man was shot in the head
in your apartment,

33:22.208 --> 33:23.835
and you're obviously
holding back information,

33:23.919 --> 33:26.212
including the nature
of your two cell phone calls

33:26.296 --> 33:28.173
prior to your calling 911.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.553
Head on downstairs, please.

33:44.606 --> 33:46.107
Something wrong?

33:47.483 --> 33:49.319
Stop the car.
I need to do something.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.119
What?

34:07.713 --> 34:09.130
We gotta stop doing this.

34:12.258 --> 34:16.221
-Doing what?
-All of it. Any of it. I can't...

34:20.726 --> 34:23.812
We're fooling ourselves thinking
that we could bring to the 21st

34:23.895 --> 34:25.105
what should have been left behind.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.273
I mean, Protocol 2--

34:27.357 --> 34:30.151
"Leave the future in the past."
But we both decided--

34:30.235 --> 34:32.528
We can't make exceptions

34:32.613 --> 34:35.365
because it's convenient, or personal.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.078
I mean, this relationship...

34:41.204 --> 34:42.831
we've been holding on to all this time,

34:42.914 --> 34:46.334
it's jeopardizing our team,
our covers, our mission.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.711
And the mission comes first, right?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.005
You know it does.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.341
Look, I just... I think we're better off--

34:53.424 --> 34:54.467
I get it.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.138
-You've got your life you gotta make work.
-I said I get it.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.890
You don't have to say any more.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.063
Drive.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.033
Stop! Stop what you're doing!

36:00.116 --> 36:01.868
- Stop what?
- Look at this.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.161
Look at this.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.039
Mission abort?

36:06.122 --> 36:08.041
The director must be back online.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.502
That message could've come
from your girlfriend for all we know.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.129
She doesn't call me 0115.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.757
Well, then it must be the faction.
They're on to what we're doing.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.718
Or the director knows what you did

36:17.801 --> 36:19.635
and communicated to me
the only way it could.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.304
You jumped into the 21st illegally.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.514
You took a host that wasn't meant for you.
You uploaded a virus--

36:23.598 --> 36:26.184
-All for the greater good.
-According to who? You?

36:26.267 --> 36:28.394
Listen, I told you that I had evidence

36:28.478 --> 36:30.230
that an attack on the director
was imminent.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.522
I had no choice but to act.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.566
Well, all I can tell you is...

36:33.649 --> 36:36.152
my mission didn't come to me as a text.

36:36.236 --> 36:38.113
It came from the director, personally.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.742
-Before the reset.
-What?

36:41.825 --> 36:43.744
You received that mission
from the director

36:43.827 --> 36:45.746
before I was able to send the reset.

36:45.829 --> 36:46.830
Obviously.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.915
I got here before you did.
What difference does it make?

36:48.999 --> 36:52.753
It was still vulnerable to corruption
by the faction at that time.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.545
You two can argue all you want.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.923
I got my mission,
and I'm seeing it through.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.843
Then I'm just gonna have to stop you.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.678
Trevor...

37:03.388 --> 37:04.890
Trevor, just...

37:04.973 --> 37:07.183
- Hey!
- Whoa, guys!

37:07.267 --> 37:09.019
Good luck with that.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.157
They're not in the house.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.908
Okay. Well, let's have a look around.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.452
Trevor!

37:25.535 --> 37:27.078
In the barn, guys!

37:42.218 --> 37:43.261
What's going on, Trev?

37:43.344 --> 37:45.180
Oh, we were just having a conversation.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.431
At gunpoint?

37:46.514 --> 37:48.892
You're not going to shoot anyone, Ellis.
Put the gun down.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.770
I've got a mission to get done,
and this young man objects.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.814
Were you given a mission
to assassinate Trevor?

37:54.815 --> 37:57.067
What? Where the hell did that come from?

37:57.150 --> 37:58.443
His mission was to build this.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.070
What is this?

38:00.821 --> 38:02.697
Has to be a quantum frame.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.783
The director wanted a fail-safe

38:04.866 --> 38:06.868
in the event it had to come back
to the 21st.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.830
And I just received a mission
from the director to destroy it.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.664
-By messenger?
-Text.

38:11.747 --> 38:14.584
I went out of the range
of the attenuation field

38:14.667 --> 38:16.211
to report in,
and this message showed up.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.546
Bah! That could be sent by anybody.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.048
It is pretty unorthodox.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.092
Or it was the only way
the director could communicate.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.384
There's no kids within miles.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.930
That message could have just as easily
come from the faction.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.474
Or the faction gave you
the order to build the quantum frame

38:29.557 --> 38:30.851
for their own purposes.

38:30.934 --> 38:31.977
Well, both can't be true.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.644
Let's figure it out, 'cause so far today,

38:33.728 --> 38:36.564
every member of my team
has been targeted by assassins.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.399
More proof that the faction
is behind this.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.985
That's not how the director does things.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.153
Unless the director sent the assassins
because we helped you.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.865
How can the faction possibly
send messages to the 21st

38:44.948 --> 38:46.282
without the director knowing about it?

38:46.366 --> 38:50.078
The director was offline for a short time
after I sent the reset command.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.163
Or the faction
has its own transfer system.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.291
There were rumors they were trying
to build one of their own in Shelter 41.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.668
Shelter 41 collapsed when I was a kid.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.130
This is something you remember?

39:00.213 --> 39:02.132
We all remember.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.634
It was a structural flaw.
The weight of the ice was too much.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.719
So we're setting aside Protocol 2 now?

39:06.802 --> 39:10.306
It collapsed at exactly 0600
as the reveille bell rang.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.267
Thousands of people died.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.894
It was horrible.

39:13.977 --> 39:18.064
Well, now, the people
of Shelter 41 are very much alive

39:18.148 --> 39:21.109
and the founders of an underground
movement against the director,

39:21.192 --> 39:24.905
which eventually became known
as the faction.

39:24.988 --> 39:27.782
-This is news to you?
-To all of us.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.242
Well, apparently
your work in the 21st

39:29.325 --> 39:31.870
has been a greater agent of change
in the future than we thought.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.621
I'm just tryin' to get my head
around this.

39:33.704 --> 39:34.705
Yeah, you too?

39:34.789 --> 39:38.751
So you're telling me the future you left
wasn't divided into two camps?

39:38.834 --> 39:40.879
One loyal to the director
and the other believing

39:40.962 --> 39:43.965
that decisions should be made by people,
not a machine?

39:44.049 --> 39:47.552
No, and that kind of division is what
got us into trouble in the first place.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.763
The world we left was loyal
to the director and the grand plan.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.598
Looks like all the grand plan
has done so far

39:52.682 --> 39:55.018
is screw things up worse than before.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.812
- How do we know they're not right?
- What?

39:57.896 --> 39:59.480
Don't be ridiculous.

39:59.564 --> 40:03.610
Humans make decisions based
on greed and desire... hate.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.195
- It's been proven.
- She's right.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.989
The director saved us
from the brink of extinction

40:08.073 --> 40:09.908
and created the grand plan,
we have to trust that.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.160
-Is that what you believe?
-Of course.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.661
All of you?

40:15.371 --> 40:17.665
I wish I could.
But then again,

40:17.748 --> 40:19.042
the director didn't send any of you

40:19.125 --> 40:21.169
back into the body
of a young man addicted to heroin.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.380
Listen, we cannot second-guess
what we came here to do.

40:24.464 --> 40:25.881
There is too much at stake.

40:25.966 --> 40:29.760
We have to have faith that the director
is working toward the greater good.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.932
So we should follow the director,

40:34.015 --> 40:36.351
no matter what mission we're given.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.603
-Is that right?
-What are you doing?

40:40.521 --> 40:41.564
Carly?

40:41.647 --> 40:44.109
Even if it's the hardest thing
you've ever had to do?

40:53.118 --> 40:55.370
"Kill 3468."

40:55.453 --> 40:57.038
That's what it says.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.749
That is the mission
I was given by the director.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.752
What do you think I should do?

41:04.379 --> 41:05.880
Well, if you're asking...

41:07.298 --> 41:08.591
I prefer that you didn't.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.096
But it's not up to me.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.017
What the hell is that?

41:17.100 --> 41:19.394
Someone's on the property.
Perimeter breach.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.562
-Assassins?
-The faction probably followed you here.

41:21.646 --> 41:25.691
Marcy, Philip, since you're not occupied
with gun pointing at the moment,

41:25.775 --> 41:27.568
would you go have a look outside, please?

41:27.652 --> 41:29.070
Go over there.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.451
I don't see anyone.

41:36.244 --> 41:37.912
I saw movement over by the house.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.415
We have to destroy the quantum frame
before they get here.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.000
-Don't do it, son.
-Boss?

41:42.083 --> 41:43.168
You know what you have to do.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.003
We don't have a choice!
They're gonna be here soon!

41:45.086 --> 41:46.129
- Don't.
- There's another way.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.235
It went right through her.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.200
-Marcy! Help Trevor!
-Put the fucking gun down and help me!

42:17.952 --> 42:20.580
Philip, what's going on out there?

42:20.663 --> 42:22.748
- Philip!
- You'll be okay.

42:22.832 --> 42:24.084
Keep applying pressure.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.919
She's a doctor.
You'll be okay.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.838
Turn off the defenses...
