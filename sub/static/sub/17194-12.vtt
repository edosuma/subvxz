WEBVTT

00:02.280 --> 00:04.511
- Missus McGrath.
- Detective.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.239
<i>My landlord's been
making advances.</i>

00:06.560 --> 00:07.914
What the hell are
you doin' in here?!

00:07.920 --> 00:09.639
<i>Mister Coddington.</i>

00:09.640 --> 00:13.077
How long, Donovan?
How long will I be your pawn?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.594
Strangled by a man
who was clearly

00:14.600 --> 00:16.273
on the edge of sanity.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.670
I assume you haven't found
a culprit yet, though.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.160
No.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.117
And I will not rest
until I catch the sick bastard

00:22.120 --> 00:23.520
who killed her.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.557
It would appear that
we have a fly in the ointment.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.669
Agh!

00:31.680 --> 00:34.115
Is this the part
where you throw me in shackles?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.156
<i>I'm here to cut a deal</i>

00:35.480 --> 00:38.120
on the condition that
you confess for your crimes.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:44.680 --> 01:45.670
Shit.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.517
Tare an'ouns.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.919
There's no turnin' back now,
boyos.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.115
<i>Jesus, Kevin.</i>

02:13.520 --> 02:15.432
Go get Donovan's thug.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.510
We need to finish
that bastard off

02:17.520 --> 02:19.079
once and for all.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.673
This is on me.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.394
I'll handle that prick.
It'll be a pleasure.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.515
All right.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.115
You meet me in Bottle Alley
at midnight.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.156
Come on, Andrew.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.912
Shit.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.310
He's gone!

03:29.320 --> 03:30.754
What do you mean he's gone?

03:30.880 --> 03:33.076
I can't believe
the bastard escaped.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.391
Bollocks!

03:37.000 --> 03:39.276
We should've just shot
the bastard dead!

03:39.280 --> 03:41.920
This is not good at all.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.958
Donovan was
the wrong man to kill.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.474
You're right about that.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.755
Detective, we're plannin' on
a drink up at Donohue's tonight.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.114
Are you game?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.393
I need you to take
this bag to Major Robert Morehouse

04:00.400 --> 04:01.629
on 23rd Street.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.994
Come on, it's payday.
Can't it wait?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.038
No, it can't.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.030
Well, whatever you need, sir.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.713
And, kid, we
never had this conversation,

04:08.720 --> 04:09.790
you never saw this bag.

04:09.800 --> 04:10.790
And you have no idea

04:10.800 --> 04:11.995
who the hell
Major Robert Morehouse is.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.877
Right.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.151
Don't you have a case
or two, some bogeyman to chase?

04:21.160 --> 04:22.276
You're not gonna
find him in here.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.919
I need you to sign
this 12-hour take out order

04:23.920 --> 04:25.195
from the tombs for me.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.510
- For who?
- Eva Heissen.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.510
That's a good one.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.591
You two forming
a new comedy team?

04:30.840 --> 04:33.355
She's to be re-interviewed
in the Ramsay matter.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.952
Do you know what Donovan
will say about that?

04:36.960 --> 04:38.110
Yeah, I know exactly
what he'll say.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.680
He sent me.
I was just at his office.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.000
Or do you want me to march
on down there

04:42.000 --> 04:44.151
and tell him you said
go screw?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.913
Huh. Fine.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.920
Where was Glynn
running off to?

04:51.280 --> 04:52.953
No idea.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.111
You seem more fidgety
than usual.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.870
Come on, it's payday.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.949
I want to get done,
hit the saloons.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.119
Detective Corcoran
was clear.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.351
This needs to get
to Major Morehouse.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.033
The Major is due home
within the hour.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.394
I'll hand it
to him directly.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.356
Thanks.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.398
I went out for
a new box of cigars.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.390
And when I returned,

05:34.400 --> 05:36.392
I saw Detective Corcoran
come running out.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.675
Carrying a bag, you said?

05:37.680 --> 05:39.751
A satchel, I would describe it.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.753
- Did he see you?
- Not that I could tell.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.752
<i>Mister Eustace.</i>

05:44.760 --> 05:46.752
Mister Holland.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.672
Gentlemen.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.069
What the hell
happened to you?

05:55.080 --> 05:57.640
Nothing that won't
be addressed.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.476
You have any idea why
Kevin Corcoran killed Donovan?

06:00.480 --> 06:03.314
The why of things
has never been my concern.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.358
I want Corcoran
brought to me, alive.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.192
Me and my men
will run him down right quick.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.635
That's not gonna be easy.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.518
Corcoran's been running
these streets and alleys

06:12.520 --> 06:14.910
since he jumped off the boat
when he was just a kid.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.274
<i>You're gonna need
all the help you can get.</i>

06:16.280 --> 06:19.114
I just assume this needs
to be done quietly.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.510
What this needs to be done
is quickly.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.910
Make Captain Sullivan
lead the charge.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.593
Have the police
put up posters:

06:25.600 --> 06:27.831
"Wanted for information,"
list no crimes.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.956
The cops will not run down
one of their--

06:28.960 --> 06:32.317
Detective Corcoran's not here,
Mister Holland.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.833
Is he?

06:47.480 --> 06:48.755
What's the deal, boss?

06:48.760 --> 06:51.070
We run that bastard
Corcoran to ground.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.480
And then what?

06:53.720 --> 06:57.316
Eustace wants him
shot dead on sight.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.876
<i>General Donovan.</i>

07:04.080 --> 07:06.515
So this is how life ends
for a legend, huh?

07:07.640 --> 07:10.678
What in good hell did
you have in those files?

07:32.240 --> 07:34.914
Where in the hell's that stamp?

07:44.680 --> 07:47.479
Ah, here she is.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.436
Kevin?

08:14.440 --> 08:18.354
Grab some things.
What you might need for a day.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.353
Christ, what you see
is what I've got.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.639
What's going on?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.958
You are being
taken to the sixth precinct

08:34.960 --> 08:37.316
for further questioning
in the Ramsay homicide.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.797
Kevin, first a mystery
package and now a surprise guest.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.120
Eva needs to stay here

09:05.120 --> 09:06.440
<i>until I can get her
out of the city.</i>

09:06.440 --> 09:08.671
Isn't she a murderess
heading for the gallows?

09:08.680 --> 09:11.036
Nobody has convicted me
of anything.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.793
There's been a change
in plans.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.917
I can have her taken
to our estate in Rhinebeck

09:15.920 --> 09:17.070
at first light.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.355
She'll be safe there.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.954
Elizabeth, will you take
Miss Heissen

09:20.960 --> 09:24.158
and get her some real food?
I'm sure it's been a while.

09:24.160 --> 09:28.712
It's been ages since
we've had any intriguing company.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.996
Miss Heissen,
please come this way.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.915
Go on now.
I'll be back soon.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.478
I need you to go through
these documents, photographs,

09:40.480 --> 09:42.597
and give me anything I can use
against Tammany.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.673
You are gonna
take on Donovan?

09:45.680 --> 09:47.273
I already did.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.920
Really?
And what happened?

09:50.800 --> 09:51.995
Donovan lost.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.517
Ma!

10:00.520 --> 10:02.398
I had one of the lads
run to Nellis' bakery

10:02.400 --> 10:03.880
for your linzer tarts!

10:03.880 --> 10:06.395
<i>Ciaran,
your friends are lovely.</i>

10:20.000 --> 10:23.596
Mom, take these
and go into your room.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.638
But I'd like to share
my pastries with these nice men.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.472
Let her stay.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.437
Please sit down, Captain.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.116
I'd prefer to stand.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.474
Oh...

10:36.760 --> 10:38.035
We are curious.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.272
Why'd you sign a take-out
order for that whore.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.476
Beg your pardon,
Eva Heissen?

10:43.480 --> 10:46.279
Because General Donovan
ordered it, that's why.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.634
Oh, he did?

10:47.640 --> 10:49.472
From the great beyond?

10:51.640 --> 10:53.120
You need to explain
yourself.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.318
Mmm...
delightful, Missus Sullivan.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.074
What a nice son
to bring you sweets.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.594
When did you last
see Corcoran?

11:02.760 --> 11:05.912
He came by to get
the take out order.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.958
I am particularly fond
of linzer tarts.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.314
They're my favorites, too.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.755
Your boy Corcoran shot
Donovan dead this evening.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.551
Does he mean Kevin?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.359
But he's a nice lad.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.317
He would never have done
a thing like that!

11:21.320 --> 11:22.549
You can't be serious.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.875
Oh, I'm not serious?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.199
Agh!

11:31.160 --> 11:33.550
I need to know
every word Corcoran said to you,.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.755
Everything he did.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.229
And we need you
to help us find him.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.838
Be a good boy
and clean her up.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.834
You tell him.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.356
Donovan's man got away.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.192
Looks like he weaseled
out of the ropes.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.000
Nothing can be done
about it now.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.673
<i>Christ, Kevin,
they'll be comin' for ya.</i>

12:06.680 --> 12:09.115
You kill a man like Donovan,
you unleash hell.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.077
You need to get as far away
as fast as you can.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.230
No.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.757
Five Points
is my neighborhood.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.234
I've killed for it
and I'll die for it

12:17.240 --> 12:19.311
if I have to.
This is my fight.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.549
<i>Bullshit!</i>

12:20.560 --> 12:22.517
If they want
to come down here,

12:22.800 --> 12:24.234
we make them pay a price.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.515
And that's a fact.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.720
Well... that settles it.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.156
We stick together.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.360
Sullivan will be leading
the hunt for me.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.079
Sully wouldn't turn
on his own.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.675
He's an organization man
like every captain.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.797
Tammany made him
and they can break him.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.439
It's the way
this town works.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.557
We need a man on the inside.
Andrew...

12:44.560 --> 12:47.200
- Go back like nothing happened.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.556
Keep your eyes open
and your ears.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.550
Help me stay ahead of them

12:50.560 --> 12:51.550
until we can sort
this thing out.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.233
Christ, Kevin,

12:53.240 --> 12:54.640
I'm a bad liar
and a lousy actor.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.518
So just play dumb.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.075
That's your speciality.

12:59.080 --> 13:03.518
Francis, I need you
to keep an eye on Eva

13:03.520 --> 13:05.432
until we can get her
out of the city.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.159
I left her
with Major Morehouse.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.310
Where are you going?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.311
Somewhere they won't
expect me to be.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.753
Forgive my brashness.
You've been a captive audience,

13:15.760 --> 13:19.470
but I feel compelled to ask.

13:20.520 --> 13:24.753
How did you choose the life,
the way of a courtesan?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.319
That's a pretty word
for whore.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.835
- No need to sugar coat my life.

13:31.840 --> 13:36.756
Um, I like sex
and I like money even more.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.999
It was a natural joining.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.872
I always feel the need
to control my own fate.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.360
That's a fantasy
existence for me,

13:44.360 --> 13:45.953
like living in a castle
with a prince.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.196
Don't be ridiculous.
Look around!

13:54.760 --> 13:57.070
I give this order
with a heavy heart.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.271
All of you need to scour
this ward

14:02.280 --> 14:03.873
for Detective Corcoran.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.039
That's bullshit, sir!

14:08.040 --> 14:10.714
It is. It's bullshit.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.870
But it is what we must do

14:11.880 --> 14:15.510
as officers
sworn to uphold the law.

14:15.520 --> 14:19.434
We don't get to pick and choose
who we go after.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.553
And if we don't act on it

14:21.560 --> 14:23.153
they'll send coppers
from another precinct

14:23.160 --> 14:25.994
who won't be so kind
to Kevin Corcoran.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.073
Now hit the streets.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.471
Oh Christ,
don't look at me like that!

14:40.480 --> 14:42.870
Kevin is the best
damn detective in this city!

14:44.560 --> 14:47.394
Kevin is now a hunted fugitive
wanted for murder.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.033
It would be great...

14:56.040 --> 14:57.838
It would be great to see a boss
in this job

14:57.840 --> 14:59.638
do the right thing
just one time!

14:59.640 --> 15:01.711
<i>What do you want
me to do? Break the goddamn law</i>

15:01.720 --> 15:03.951
because Kevin
high-and-mighty Corcoran

15:03.960 --> 15:05.314
decides to take the law
into his own hands?!

15:05.320 --> 15:07.755
No, stand up for your own
and be a man.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.876
Oh, so I'm the bad one now?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.349
Not your pal who decides
it'd be a grand idea

15:11.360 --> 15:13.511
to shoot dead
a ward boss?

15:13.520 --> 15:15.193
What the hell did he think
was gonna happen?!

15:15.200 --> 15:16.953
He never would have done it
if Donovan didn't deserve it.

15:16.960 --> 15:17.950
Oh, really?

15:17.960 --> 15:18.950
Like all of a sudden
that matters?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.713
It matters to me!

15:22.720 --> 15:27.715
You're a kid, Andrew.
I've been around.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.519
I've seen what the organization
is capable of.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.959
Well, I guess that's
the difference between us.

15:34.960 --> 15:39.955
I'm loyal to my friends,
not some goddamn organization.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.154
<i>Well, good for you.</i>

15:43.200 --> 15:44.680
Now get your ass out there
and find Corcoran

15:44.680 --> 15:47.400
or you'll be lucky to find a job
cleaning the goddamn streets.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.196
Evening, Missus McGrath.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.113
<i>Detective, what is it?</i>

16:16.120 --> 16:17.395
Has something happened?
Is it my Michael?

16:17.400 --> 16:20.154
No, no,
it's nothing at all.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.959
I was just hoping
I could come in and talk.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.999
Hang on a second.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.516
I'll grab my shawl,
make myself decent.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.153
Thank you.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.916
So Michael's not at home?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.435
He's gone with Alec
the butcher.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.477
He raises hogs
out on Long Island.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.352
We had a pig farm
down the road from me

17:10.359 --> 17:11.953
when I was a boy.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.752
The stench of the place was...

17:16.680 --> 17:18.830
Well, what brings you
to my door

17:18.839 --> 17:20.433
if not a calamity?

17:21.200 --> 17:24.989
It's kind of a long story,
complicated.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.233
Ach! Well, I'm at least
half a spinster these days.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.709
I have nothing to do
but stare at these here walls.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.832
Come on, sit.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.233
I'll get you something
to drink.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.874
<i>What's your preference?</i>

17:41.200 --> 17:45.035
Right now?
I could really use a whiskey.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.876
The mayor has
a bastard living in Passaic.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.997
Christ!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.593
This bag of tricks
is more entertaining

17:53.600 --> 17:55.319
than a night
at the burlie show.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.959
I have to find Kevin,

17:59.760 --> 18:01.956
let him know
what he's got on his hands.

18:02.360 --> 18:05.114
I would hew to a cautious tack
when dealing with those people.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.840
They do not play
by our rules.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.639
Maybe that's because
we don't let "those people"

18:10.640 --> 18:11.630
in the game.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.950
That may very well be,
but don't be a fool, Robert.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.679
Life is cheap downtown.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.557
I imagine a lot of bad things
will be said about me.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.711
General Donovan is
a popular man around here.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.551
Was...

18:28.120 --> 18:29.270
Once word gets out
about what he's done,

18:29.280 --> 18:31.272
that won't be the case.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.200
You're a bit of a dreamer,
are ya?

18:37.160 --> 18:38.640
How is that?

18:40.280 --> 18:41.396
America's a tough place

18:41.400 --> 18:43.232
to think you can fight
the system.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.995
Well, maybe but...

18:49.480 --> 18:50.994
I don't regret
what I done.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.636
I regret not thinking it
through properly though.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.434
Well, now, I guess
we'll see how good you are

19:03.440 --> 19:04.840
at thinkin' on your feet.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.960
Officer Glynn.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.839
I need you to stay
right there, sir.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.876
Huh?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.473
Agh!

19:21.080 --> 19:23.117
Where's the satchel?

19:24.160 --> 19:25.799
Where the hell am I?

19:27.280 --> 19:29.511
You are either
safe among friends

19:29.520 --> 19:30.510
or you are not.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.159
That is up to you.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.833
Piss off!

19:35.960 --> 19:37.599
"Piss off," he says.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.000
You have something we want.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.193
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.839
I'm a copper! You can't just
grab me off the street!

19:46.840 --> 19:48.274
Where's the satchel?

19:48.880 --> 19:50.473
What are you on about?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.838
Must be a real
tough bastard.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.514
Yeah, a real hard case.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.110
As a beat cop...

20:00.520 --> 20:03.194
...you spend a lot of time
on your feet, don't ya?

20:05.520 --> 20:08.479
The answer is still piss off!

20:15.120 --> 20:16.713
What's the matter?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.117
Don't they pay you enough
to buy decent socks?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.919
This is the last time
I'm gonna ask nice.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.435
Where is what Kevin Corcoran
gave to you?

20:26.440 --> 20:29.114
I told you I don't know what
the hell you're talkin' about!

20:29.120 --> 20:30.873
The only thing Corcoran's
ever given me is...

20:30.880 --> 20:33.156
Is his advice or grief!

20:34.560 --> 20:36.392
Would you please
convince this young copper

20:36.400 --> 20:40.553
that sharing with us
is an intelligent idea?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.112
<i>This little piggy
went to market,</i>

20:49.120 --> 20:51.271
<i>this little piggy stayed home,</i>

20:52.280 --> 20:56.160
<i>this little piggy had roast beef,</i>

20:56.160 --> 20:58.436
<i>and this little piggy had none.</i>

20:58.440 --> 21:01.433
<i>And this little piggy...</i>

21:01.440 --> 21:03.159
...got chopped off.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.755
I don't know anything!
I swear to God!

21:10.760 --> 21:11.750
Another one.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.037
Don't!

21:19.640 --> 21:21.632
Agh!

21:23.840 --> 21:29.154
Okay, I'll talk.
I'll talk.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.838
Don't say a word.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.590
Not a thing.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.792
Stay put.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.553
I'll check it out.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.996
I can't go back
to that cell. I can't.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.793
Hey, can you handle
this without hurtin' yourself?

23:17.800 --> 23:18.790
Ah, sure enough.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.712
I was with the lads
at Balingarry back in '48.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.554
Ah, tare an'ouns, a Fenian
under Morehouse's roof.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.550
Love to hear
all about that.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.392
In the meantime,
lurk behind me.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.516
Give these bastards
the impression

23:27.520 --> 23:29.079
there's more of us.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.800
Where's Robert Morehouse?

23:34.800 --> 23:37.872
Ah, he was out in the country
hunting foxes, last I heard.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.236
We're
coming in to look around.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.072
I think not.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.515
You don't look like
you're from around here.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.512
You look like
downtown riff-raff

23:46.520 --> 23:48.591
Ready to commit
burglaries.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.831
You're makin'
a big mistake.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.753
So I'd be justified in shootin'
the both of you dead.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.310
You'll be sorry, boyo.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.720
Not as sorry as your momma's
gonna be three days from now.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.600
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

24:04.600 --> 24:06.114
She'll be watching them
lower your casket

24:06.120 --> 24:07.474
into the ground.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.152
Hmm.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.631
<i>Doctor!
Doctor Freeman!</i>

24:41.480 --> 24:44.917
Doctor, I can't make it
all the way to the hospital.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.520
Come here, get you inside.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.831
Sara, get some water,
clean towels.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.310
Easy, easy.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.357
They took my toes, Doctor.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.476
They took my toes.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.154
I know, I know, I know.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.675
It's gonna be okay.
Come on now.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.831
Easy now, come on.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.674
<i>All right, one more step.
Okay.</i>

25:08.680 --> 25:11.036
Mmm, please I'm stuffed!

25:12.160 --> 25:13.310
You know, all the girls
around here

25:13.320 --> 25:15.676
are well enamored of you.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.797
They are?

25:17.800 --> 25:20.440
I took a good
ribbing over our acquaintance.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.717
"Detective Looker"
they call you.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.635
Say you are as fine
a man as any

25:26.640 --> 25:28.632
to help a woman
with her troubles,

25:28.640 --> 25:30.438
they say.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.910
Well...

25:33.920 --> 25:36.196
Now you're helping me
with my troubles.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.032
Look, I...

25:39.040 --> 25:41.236
I can't thank you enough...

25:41.240 --> 25:44.870
...letting me stay
and feeding me.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.190
You'll be back later?

25:53.040 --> 25:55.999
Don't know how good
an idea that is.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.597
Who are you kiddin'?

25:58.600 --> 26:02.719
It's as grand an idea
as any you got, copper.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.598
Fair point.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.479
But I don't want
to put you in danger.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.995
Come on now.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.310
We Irish need
to stick together.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.033
I guess we do.

26:47.520 --> 26:52.186
<i>Reward for anyone
who catches him!</i>

27:08.520 --> 27:11.194
<i>I saw Eva off to Rhinebeck,</i>

27:11.200 --> 27:14.079
and then I tried to get a bead
on Donovan's man.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.356
Turns out his name
is David Holland.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.350
All anyone knows,

27:17.360 --> 27:19.272
he's a hitter
for the organization.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.000
Some say he's from Brooklyn,
some say Hoboken.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.992
As long as we get him
before he gets us.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.520
<i>You've stumbled
onto quite the bonanza.</i>

27:30.480 --> 27:33.279
Donovan was quite the cataloguer
of weakness and vice.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.676
So what do we have?

27:35.680 --> 27:37.034
If this were poker,

27:37.040 --> 27:38.952
you'd be sitting on
pocket aces, at least.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.078
Christ, I'd say more
like a royal flush.

27:43.080 --> 27:46.039
<i>One thing
Tammany hates is bad press.</i>

27:46.040 --> 27:49.158
So I fire a couple
of shots off their bow

27:49.160 --> 27:50.753
And see what happens?

27:50.760 --> 27:53.036
It beats running
and hiding like a basement rat.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.712
And I got just
the man to help us.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.393
This happy fella here,
Coddington...

27:58.400 --> 28:00.039
...reporter for The Tribune.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.156
I'll go scoop him up then.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.230
Go get him!

28:06.560 --> 28:08.631
Did you put my toes back on?

28:09.560 --> 28:11.438
You'll be running
in the Tammany races for sure

28:11.440 --> 28:12.794
this Fourth of July.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.960
What kind of people
would chop off a man's toes?

28:21.520 --> 28:23.591
The kind that don't take
"no" for an answer.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.996
What's with
the sad face?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.435
Corcoran is proving
elusive,

28:37.440 --> 28:40.751
but I'll get him
by nightfall.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.150
You don't have
a choice.

28:43.160 --> 28:46.198
Find him or keep going
until you hit Chicago.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.830
Mister Coddington,
can you come with me, please?

29:02.600 --> 29:05.434
You have
no call to apprehend me.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.592
I'm not arresting ya.
I'm actually doing you a favor.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.239
What is this in reference to?

29:12.280 --> 29:14.078
It's in reference
to gettin' back the pictures

29:14.080 --> 29:16.117
of you and the dark prostitutes.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.070
Now come on.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.996
Mister Eustace.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.959
Captain Sullivan,
how are you?

29:31.960 --> 29:33.314
Good.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.552
Boden's mate.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.670
Impressive.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.512
I'm trying to expand
my game.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.073
Aren't we all.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.990
Why don't you sit down,
Captain, please?

29:52.400 --> 29:54.756
<i>I know that this must be
unpleasant for you.</i>

29:54.760 --> 29:58.071
By all accounts,
Detective Corcoran's a good man.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.595
We've had our differences,
but he is solid.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.035
I can't imagine
what would have driven him

30:02.040 --> 30:03.156
to commit such an act.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.750
I'm sure he felt
the proper motivation.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.438
So May 21st
you're a 30-year man, no?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.352
Hard to believe.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.840
Put in two years
on the Erie Canal

30:16.440 --> 30:19.035
and came home
to join the coppers.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.312
I know you're a fan
of the theater.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.758
Front row, <i>Petroliamania,</i>
at Wood's Minstrel Hall.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.752
Bring your mother,
Margaret.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.353
Well, thank you,
I guess.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.397
I came to express in person

30:36.400 --> 30:38.869
how vital it is
that we find Corcoran,

30:38.880 --> 30:41.679
how important it is
to the organization.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.752
I don't really need you
to illuminate that for me.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.473
And to let you know that
we have a vacancy coming up

30:48.480 --> 30:51.871
down at headquarters.
Deputy Commissioner.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.550
Interesting.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.755
I just don't know
what to make of the way

30:56.760 --> 30:58.991
this world works anymore.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.832
The world is fine, Sully.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.436
It's, uh, Five Points
that's always been mad.

31:06.080 --> 31:09.039
You bring me Corcoran,
alive,

31:10.200 --> 31:12.795
that commissionership is yours.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.995
Let's start with
a goodwill gesture.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.038
Now nobody has anything
hanging over your head.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.316
And uh...

31:33.320 --> 31:36.552
And what would you like
in return?

31:36.560 --> 31:40.873
These files show
exactly what we suspected.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.440
Donovan was
as corrupt as Caligula,

31:43.440 --> 31:44.669
warehousing properties

31:44.680 --> 31:45.909
and selling them
back to the city

31:45.920 --> 31:47.718
at as much as
50 times their value.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.440
Using blackmail and violence
to get his way.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.274
And he used to love
to needle me for my hobbies.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.555
That bastard.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.031
I'm glad he's dead.
I am glad, I am happy.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.350
I don't care if you go
dancing in the street.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.478
There's enough information here
to get us on the front page.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.470
Afternoon edition.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.960
I can give you
an explosive story,

32:05.960 --> 32:09.317
front and center...
with pleasure.

32:12.720 --> 32:13.710
My newspaper would pay

32:13.720 --> 32:15.313
a handsome finder's fee
for these.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.118
This isn't for sale.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.073
Knowledge is power.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.440
Please,
have a nice day.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.314
I'll take you back uptown.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.072
Yes.Yes.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.672
<i>Hannigan?</i>

32:44.640 --> 32:47.280
You say you know
where this man is?

32:47.280 --> 32:50.512
I sure do.
Hand over the reward

32:50.520 --> 32:52.512
and I'll bring you fellas
right to him.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.671
He wants the reward.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.354
You'll get your reward
when we get Corcoran.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.680
Now where is he?

33:01.840 --> 33:03.718
Second door
on the right.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.630
I can let you in
myself.

33:06.640 --> 33:07.915
No.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.951
<i>Ow! Would you watch
where you're goin'?!</i>

33:40.120 --> 33:40.871
What the hell's going on?

33:40.880 --> 33:41.916
Come on,
Let's take a walk.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.993
Kevin?!

33:51.000 --> 33:52.320
I need your help!

33:57.920 --> 33:59.240
What the hell happened to him?

33:59.240 --> 34:01.038
Apparently he wasn't
forthcoming quickly enough

34:01.040 --> 34:02.315
with information about you.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.596
Cost him two toes
off of his left foot.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.875
Oh, Jesus!

34:07.600 --> 34:09.239
Those bastards!

34:11.080 --> 34:15.074
Can you keep her here
for a day or so at the most?

34:15.080 --> 34:16.911
Doctor Freeman's home for those
buffeted by Kevin Corcoran's--

34:16.920 --> 34:18.320
Matthew!

34:18.320 --> 34:20.551
I guess I should be glad
to be so needed.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.280
We will do whatever
is necessary, Kevin.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.273
Thanks. Really.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.194
Congratulations.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.315
I'm sorry?

34:32.320 --> 34:33.514
Have I accomplished
something?

34:33.520 --> 34:34.636
You are the first person

34:34.639 --> 34:36.438
that Kevin Corcoran
has ever brought to our door

34:36.440 --> 34:37.998
who wasn't dead
or bleeding.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.632
Captain, take a stroll?

34:44.639 --> 34:45.596
Where the hell to?

34:45.600 --> 34:46.636
For old times' sake,
will ya?

34:46.639 --> 34:49.599
I don't have time
for gamboling about the ward with...

34:49.600 --> 34:53.116
Captain, please...
Don't make me insist.

34:56.639 --> 34:58.279
Down here, Captain.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.754
Corcoran.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.191
For your own good
you need to surrender.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.150
That's not an option,
Captain.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.231
Then run.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.993
Christ, get on a ship,
sail away!

35:24.000 --> 35:24.990
Ten years from now,
who knows,

35:25.000 --> 35:25.956
Maybe they'll
all be gone!

35:25.960 --> 35:28.794
It's simple. I need you
to pass on a tip.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.994
I need you to tell Holland
that I'm hiding out

35:32.000 --> 35:35.277
in the warehouse
at 812 Pearl Street.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.477
I don't have your balls,
Kevin.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.880
I'm scared to death
of these people.

35:51.880 --> 35:53.473
I need you to do this.

35:53.480 --> 35:57.679
We all need you to do this,
Captain.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.991
All right.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.673
Goddamn it.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.152
Go! Just, just go!

36:19.480 --> 36:22.518
Sir, I thought
you'd better see this.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.794
Well, well, "Tammany Greed."

36:31.800 --> 36:35.510
Corcoran,
you are one cute bastard.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.632
Agh!

37:08.480 --> 37:10.119
You bastards.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.157
<i>Holland?</i>

37:12.160 --> 37:13.480
You looking for me?

37:16.240 --> 37:18.357
You should have stayed
the hell out of Five Points.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.353
You just shot me
in the balls!

37:21.360 --> 37:23.511
You're in far
better shape than your pals.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.320
You wanna live?

37:29.320 --> 37:30.834
Tell me who sent you.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.355
Not such a tough
bastard now, are ya?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.195
Eustace.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.630
You said...

37:48.640 --> 37:50.518
I lied.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.071
Well, that's done.
Now what?

37:57.720 --> 37:59.439
Now I go see
Wild Bill Eustace.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.319
The killing can end
or I can continue with you,

38:08.760 --> 38:09.796
right here and right now.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.592
Well, you've made
quite a mess, Detective.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.714
And it's gonna take
a fair amount of cleaning up

38:16.760 --> 38:18.672
to fix it.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.912
<i>Ronnie, give Detective Corcoran
and me some privacy.</i>

38:27.720 --> 38:28.676
You're wrong.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.718
I didn't make any mess,
Donovan did.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.914
You know...

38:38.680 --> 38:40.672
Greed does funny
things to people.

38:40.680 --> 38:44.913
Donovan was a good man
who... just went bad.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.916
But that doesn't absolve you
from his killing.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.598
This is the least
of your problems.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.310
I got enough in Donovan's files
to ruin all of ya.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.594
You know...

39:04.920 --> 39:06.434
They told me you were
a stubborn man.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.159
Yet you came here
prepared to make a deal.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.235
What is it
that you want?

39:14.920 --> 39:18.550
First, Eva Heissen goes free,

39:19.200 --> 39:20.759
all charges dropped.

39:20.960 --> 39:21.950
Done.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.470
Second...

39:29.120 --> 39:30.998
Donovan's death
is ruled a suicide.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.594
You haven't heard?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.590
Heard what?

39:40.680 --> 39:42.876
General Donovan was killed
cleaning his weapon.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.839
Accidental discharge,
tragic loss to the community,

39:45.840 --> 39:48.400
blah, blah, et cetera.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.519
So the bastard gets
a hero's funeral?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.557
Donovan was just that...

39:54.560 --> 39:57.632
a hero for most
of his life.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.632
He choked the life
out of an innocent woman,

39:59.640 --> 40:01.996
among other sins.

40:04.040 --> 40:07.158
Detective, are you missing
what appears to be the obvious?

40:08.840 --> 40:12.754
That, uh, nobody will be
prosecuted for his murder.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.754
I don't know if I can accept
Donovan being absolved.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.997
Even if it deprives
Sixth Warders of their belief

40:20.000 --> 40:21.320
that there's Robin Hoods
out there

40:21.320 --> 40:22.595
fightin' for 'em?

40:23.760 --> 40:24.910
I'm not done.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.749
I'm not surprised.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.152
You can build your aqueduct

40:29.160 --> 40:31.391
as long as it goes through
someone else's neighborhood.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.199
Where'd you have
in mind?

40:35.840 --> 40:37.638
I hear you live
in Greenwich Village.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.040
Sounds good to me.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.440
Well, I suppose
I've got some neighbors

40:44.440 --> 40:45.430
I wouldn't miss.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.511
But, uh, I'm gonna have
to take that one upstairs.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.474
You're a fixer.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.359
I'll give you two days
to fix it.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.310
Listen, kid,
don't overplay your hand.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.037
<i>Last thing.</i>

41:02.720 --> 41:05.110
I get to name
Donovan's replacement.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.839
You care to share with me
who you've got in mind?

41:15.040 --> 41:16.793
I'll get back to you
on that.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.957
We jump out
and just start blastin'!

41:27.960 --> 41:29.917
I catch this one jackass,
the big one.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.593
The big one
high up in the chest.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.590
<i>He goes down, Captain,</i>

41:32.600 --> 41:34.193
<i>like he was kicked
by a goddamn mule!</i>

41:34.240 --> 41:35.754
Oh, I wish I'd
been able to see that!

41:35.840 --> 41:36.830
<i>He was dead
before he hit the ground.</i>

41:36.840 --> 41:37.830
Before he hit the ground,
he was dead.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.638
<i>- The big one?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

41:39.640 --> 41:41.199
That's the asshole
who cut my toes off.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.396
Come on now, Stubby,
don't be looking for sympathy.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.471
This goes on you,
ya cheap bastard!

41:45.480 --> 41:47.597
You lose a toe, you buy a drink,
them's the rules.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.716
<i>There goes my salary!</i>

41:48.720 --> 41:52.680
Ladies and gentlemen...
Eva Heissen!

41:52.680 --> 41:54.831
The queen!

41:54.840 --> 41:57.230
Escape the gallows,
she did!

41:58.280 --> 42:01.079
- Eva!
- The queen returns!

42:09.680 --> 42:10.750
Hey, Eva, where are you going?

42:10.760 --> 42:12.080
You all have fun.

42:12.080 --> 42:14.037
I'll go up to sleep
in my own bed... finally.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.793
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

42:15.800 --> 42:17.519
Come on!

42:17.520 --> 42:20.160
Let her go,
let her go.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.959
Here's to
the new king of Five Points!

42:23.960 --> 42:25.679
<i>To the king!</i>

42:25.680 --> 42:27.000
<i>King Corcoran!</i>

42:28.080 --> 42:29.992
King Kevin Corcoran!

42:30.000 --> 42:31.229
<i>Here's to ya!</i>

42:31.240 --> 42:32.435
<i>It sounds good!</i>

42:33.840 --> 42:38.073
Jesus!
Doctor Freeman in Eva's.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.477
Come on,
I got a drink for you.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.872
What's wrong,
Matthew? What's wrong?

42:44.680 --> 42:45.636
Lincoln's been shot.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.955
What did you say?

42:50.280 --> 42:52.078
The president has been assass--

42:54.120 --> 42:55.440
The president has been
assassinated.
