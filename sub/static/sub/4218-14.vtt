WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:04.587
Look out!

00:05.631 --> 00:07.006
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:07.174 --> 00:08.257
They granted her parole.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.678
There is one condition.
She has to
move in with me.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.974
Your place? 10 minutes?

00:17.142 --> 00:18.142
You're on.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.356
I moved out.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.440
What?

00:24.608 --> 00:26.275
I told Daniel
it wasn't gonna work.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.610
Stay with me.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.280
Recovery time
could be four weeks
instead of one year.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.324
How come I didn't hear about
this from my other surgeon?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.868
It's experimental.
There are real risks here,

00:36.036 --> 00:37.954
including partial paralysis.

00:38.122 --> 00:41.249
Disappoint everyone,
but don't ever
disappoint yourself.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.042
You want to stay.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.211
I can't go with you.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.387
Fold your arms
behind your back,

00:56.348 --> 00:58.307
lifting your hands
as high as they'll go.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.144
And extend your arms
forward,

01:03.689 --> 01:04.939
bend your elbows.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.903
Press up against my hands.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.947
Thank you, Lieutenant.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.200
Be right back.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.012
Hey!

01:37.306 --> 01:38.306
Hey.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.518
Well?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.272
Full duty.
Starting next shift.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.523
Bang!

01:47.691 --> 01:49.525
Congratulations!
Pretty great, huh?

01:49.693 --> 01:51.402
Yes!
This is so great!

01:51.570 --> 01:52.904
So happy for you.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.071
Thank you.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.992
Uh, hey,
just a heads up.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.245
Eric Whaley is still there.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.332
I got no beef with him.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.214
How's the little one?

02:13.425 --> 02:16.803
Yeah, things are working out
surprisingly well,

02:16.970 --> 02:19.305
considering Clarice
is in the bathroom
every 10 minutes.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.016
Yeah. Severide's just...

02:22.184 --> 02:23.684
He's been totally cool
since she moved in.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.228
That's nice of him.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.105
I mean, going up and down
that spiral staircase
with a baby,

02:28.273 --> 02:29.482
that's gonna suck.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.611
But, we should probably just
leave him up there until he
can walk down himself.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.155
Um...

02:37.157 --> 02:40.326
I get that you're
not a huge fan of Clarice,

02:40.494 --> 02:41.702
but we're a couple now,

02:41.870 --> 02:44.247
and I'm looking basically
to be a step-mom.

02:45.541 --> 02:46.916
So I need your support.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.125
I'm sleeping with Mills.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.420
I knew it!

02:51.922 --> 02:53.548
You skank!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.842
You kept it from me
this whole time?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.969
We agreed to keep
it cool at work, so...

02:58.136 --> 02:59.136
Does Casey know?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.346
I don't think so.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.223
Are you gonna tell him?
Do you think I should?

03:02.391 --> 03:03.599
So, you're over him?

03:03.767 --> 03:06.143
Look, he zigged, I zagged.
Wasn't meant to be.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.646
How's the sex with Mills?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.149
I...

03:12.317 --> 03:15.403
I really like him,
but it's not just
a physical thing.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.864
So let's just say he's very...

03:19.700 --> 03:21.367
...detail-oriented.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.287
But, here's the problem.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.497
He wants me to meet his mom,
and I'm...

03:26.665 --> 03:28.124
I'm just not there yet.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.085
What would you do?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.589
Detail-oriented, huh?

03:38.051 --> 03:41.012
Ambulance 61,
Truck 81, Squad 3.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.393
Driver fled the scene,
but the passenger's pinned
in there pretty good.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.186
Door's jammed.
We've got to cut her out.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.440
Bruce, Otis? Get ready to
assist Squad at that end.

03:54.234 --> 03:54.984
Are you hurt anywhere?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.569
It's okay.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.197
All right, sweetie,
this is gonna go
around your neck.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.365
Can you tell us a name?

04:01.533 --> 04:02.783
Ambrosia.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.660
Oh, yeah?
You working tonight?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.162
A little.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.332
You were in my dreams.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.502
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:13.670 --> 04:15.046
Here, sweetie.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.714
Come on. What'd you take,
sweetie?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.257
Dawson.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.926
Track marks.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.637
Hey, Casey?
How long till we
get in there?

04:22.804 --> 04:24.221
Five. Maybe 10.
Let's go!

04:24.389 --> 04:26.182
Capp, be ready
with the spreaders.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.100
Hadley, we need
the ram for the dashboard.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.518
Got it.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.789
All right!

04:54.419 --> 04:55.544
Okay.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.923
All right, guys,
watch her head.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.300
Try to keep her steady.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.095
Okay, good.
She's gonna arrest!

05:04.930 --> 05:06.305
We've got to get her
to the hospital now.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.807
Let's get her up.
Let go of the handle.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.225
There you go.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.268
I'm barely getting
a pulse on her.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.731
Fifth heroin OD this week.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.192
What the hell's going on?

05:29.204 --> 05:32.999
Yeah, I asked Nancy
what was on her Bucket List
once she got out.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.419
She didn't get the reference.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.089
You forget how closed off
these prisoners are

05:40.257 --> 05:41.966
in terms of movies

05:42.134 --> 05:44.051
and popular culture and stuff.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.388
Little things that we
take for granted.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.062
I'm just gonna give
my congratulations

05:55.230 --> 05:57.106
and then I'll let you two
have your time together.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.358
Sounds good.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.252
I can't believe
this is really happening.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.301
Rick.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.138
Thank you.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.143
I'll drop by once
you get all settled.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.480
Okay.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.276
Ready?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.082
Oh, boy.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.881
Welcome back.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.467
Hey, Dawson.
Welcome back.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.095
About damn time.
Thanks, Chief.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.639
And the neck's
100%, right?

07:11.807 --> 07:13.933
Yeah, you wanna spar
a few rounds after shift
and find out?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.352
Yeah, I'm good.
Hey, this is, uh, Pouch.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.229
Best damn thing to ever happen
to this house.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.147
Otis is transferring.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.110
What? Come on,
it's not like I'm being
rocketed into space.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.444
I'm going over to Morningside.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.154
Kelly,

07:28.115 --> 07:29.031
your relief lieutenant,

07:29.199 --> 07:30.199
Eric Whaley.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.037
It's been awhile.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.414
Yeah.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.792
You two know each other?

07:41.670 --> 07:43.003
Yeah, I was, uh...

07:45.215 --> 07:46.590
...engaged to Eric's sister.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.134
Ah, got it.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.677
The original Renee?

07:50.428 --> 07:51.470
There was a second one?

07:53.932 --> 07:56.100
Well, now that you're back,
Whaley will move over to
Engine

07:56.268 --> 07:58.185
and relieve Jeff Turner
for the next few shifts.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.020
Okay, everyone,
listen up.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.566
Some of you may know
Gabby's brother,
Detective Antonio Dawson.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.193
He has some information
from CPD for us.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.361
Thanks, Chief.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.365
Last few weeks
have seen a spike in
fatal overdoses.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.369
ME's office as connected
at least a dozen deaths
to a toxic batch of heroin.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.872
Now, be aware,
it's laced with fentanyl

08:18.331 --> 08:22.084
and in most cases does
not respond to the normal
protocol of Naloxone.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.712
We are now approaching
each overdose as a
potential homicide.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.382
Truck 81, Squad 3,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.218
Engine 51, Ambulance 61.
Structure fire.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.179
Gabby.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.222
You're on the front lines
of this thing.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.182
Yeah, I'll look into it.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.309
See, that's exactly what I
don't want you to do.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.020
The crew that's
pushing this bad dope,
they don't mess around.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.230
As opposed to all those
amicable drug dealers
out there?

08:43.398 --> 08:46.150
I'm serious. Be careful.
Don't go Gabby on this.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.194
Hey, you look like hell.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.778
Good morning to you, too.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.339
Looks like the fire's
in the back, probably
where the kitchen is.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.924
Truck, get inside,
open up the windows
and the exits.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.050
Give me a primary search.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.843
Engine,
get an attack line
in the front.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.221
Herrmann, Mills,
open up the back.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.639
Otis, secure the utilities.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.225
Mouch, Cruz.
Where's Cruz?

09:22.354 --> 09:23.812
Cruz,
put your mask on!

09:32.405 --> 09:34.406
There's somebody in here!
All right, well, find him!

09:40.747 --> 09:42.831
Fire department!
Is there anybody in here?

09:50.048 --> 09:52.758
Fire's in the exhaust system.
We've got to get that aerial
up to the roof!

09:52.926 --> 09:54.385
Herrmann, Mills,
get that ladder set!

09:54.552 --> 09:55.719
Just give me
a line up there.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.058
Severide,
give me a progress report.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.479
Primary search
of the kitchen, negative.

10:12.946 --> 10:13.988
It's got a vent!

10:21.830 --> 10:24.123
Yeah, he's over here.
Okay, let's clear a path.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.337
Hey! Grab the end.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.512
All right, let's do it!

10:43.351 --> 10:44.518
We got you.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.816
Keep feeding me line!

10:52.861 --> 10:54.820
Good! Vent's open.

10:54.988 --> 10:55.988
Send the water!

11:02.912 --> 11:04.455
Push him all the way up.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.053
Board up crews.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.637
Why do they always
look like gangsters?

11:21.639 --> 11:24.558
Because they are.
Do you have any idea what
these contracts are worth?

11:26.394 --> 11:27.394
Vultures.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.068
Hey! It's not as bad as it
looks, Old Timer.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.153
That kitchen ceiling is gonna
to need some patching up,

11:36.321 --> 11:37.946
but other than that it's just
a lot of smoke damage.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.156
It's a sign

11:39.324 --> 11:41.075
to finally get my ass
to Florida.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.495
Want to buy a bar?

11:55.590 --> 11:57.925
So, you a fireman
or a kamikaze pilot now?

11:58.093 --> 12:00.677
Saved the old man.
The fire's out.
That's all that matters.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.055
It matters if you get
yourself killed.

12:15.819 --> 12:16.944
Eric.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.869
Look, man,
when the whole thing
went down,

12:26.037 --> 12:28.038
you and I weren't talking,
obviously,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.083
and I never got a chance
to apologize.

12:32.836 --> 12:35.045
I really am sorry
for what happened.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.924
We used to be friends
once, right?

12:41.636 --> 12:43.387
I'm only here
a couple more shifts.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.115
So, how is your neck?

13:03.908 --> 13:04.992
100%.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.743
You'd tell me if it wasn't,
right?

13:06.911 --> 13:08.454
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.957
Yeah, right.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.751
Otis, Casey.
My office.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.091
Otis.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.011
Your transfer just came
through.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.889
You report to Morningside,
next shift.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.058
Oh. Wow. Um...

13:30.935 --> 13:31.935
So it's official.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.645
Only if you want it to be.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.024
Look, we know you made
this decision based off
of one shift there.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.235
But you have had a month
to think about it.

13:41.112 --> 13:41.945
We wanted to give you an
opportunity to...

13:42.113 --> 13:43.989
I'm ready to go, Chief.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.368
Otis,

13:49.871 --> 13:51.663
we do a lot of
ball-breaking in this house.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.707
It's not that
we don't appreciate you.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.876
But if anybody ever
crossed the line...

13:56.044 --> 13:57.419
It's not personal,
Lieutenant.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.506
Morningside's a smaller house.
I'll have a better chance of

14:01.174 --> 14:03.008
getting off elevators sooner.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.219
And they let me drive.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.097
They'll be lucky to have you.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.143
Thanks, Chief.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.063
Good luck, Brian.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.106
Lieutenant.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.117
Whoa.
What are you doing here?

14:29.285 --> 14:30.786
I need to talk real quick.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.337
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.175
This ought to be good.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.888
If anyone calls you, asking if
we went to a movie last night,
the answer is "yes."

14:51.224 --> 14:52.182
This heroin thing,

14:53.184 --> 14:56.144
it's starting to blow up
a little bit and I'm damn
close to making some busts.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.437
Okay.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.900
The thing is, the guys
over in Narcotics,
they get real territorial

15:02.068 --> 15:04.236
and they don't want
a guy from Vice
taking collars from them.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.072
So I told a little
white lie to my boss

15:08.199 --> 15:09.575
'cause I wasn't where I was
supposed to be last night

15:09.742 --> 15:11.368
and I said
that you and I...

15:11.536 --> 15:13.036
Can you just say
"yes" if anyone asks?

15:15.081 --> 15:17.082
Why do I feel like I'm not
getting the whole story?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.376
'Cause you're not
getting the whole story.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.627
I'm working a case.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.671
Will you cover
for me please?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.801
Uh...
Of course you will.
Thank you.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.019
Hey.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.980
I just did a little recon
on that bar owner.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.189
You're not actually
thinking of buying it?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.525
Me alone? No.

15:43.693 --> 15:47.696
But, would I be
willing to be a part
of a consortium?

15:48.406 --> 15:49.531
Maybe.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.907
All right, first of all,

15:51.075 --> 15:52.784
that guy was as old as dirt.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.787
And second of all,
he did a face plant
off a ladder.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.206
I doubt he even recollects
making an offer to sell.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.251
You heard him.
He wants to get his ass
to Florida.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.128
He's gonna sell that place.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.173
It's in an up and coming
neighborhood,

16:06.341 --> 16:07.549
he owns the property

16:07.717 --> 16:10.218
and he's got the brass ring.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.304
A liquor license.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.181
There's the worm.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.058
It's right there.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.268
Who's gonna
be the early bird?

16:19.896 --> 16:21.104
Why not us?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.024
I'm telling you,

16:24.192 --> 16:26.276
if this place hits
the open market,

16:26.444 --> 16:31.031
some hipster douchebags
are gonna swoop in
and print money.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.241
Hmm.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.040
No vision in this house.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.084
None.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.044
Zero!

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
So, um,

17:02.230 --> 17:03.188
who's this new Renee?

17:04.941 --> 17:06.024
I'm curious.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.403
I apologized.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.988
I offered to put it past us.

17:12.699 --> 17:16.493
If that's not something that
you're up for and you'd rather
keep it frosty 'til you leave,

17:16.661 --> 17:18.161
I can do that, too.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.747
What are you
apologizing for?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.876
For dumping her two days
before the wedding?
Or for what happened after?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.379
You're not in full possession
of all the facts here, Eric.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.381
Then enlighten me, Kelly.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.179
That's what I thought.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.308
You were a coward then
and you're a coward now.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.024
Before this goes
any further south,
why don't you walk away?

17:50.445 --> 17:51.737
Or what?

17:54.866 --> 17:56.283
Excuse me.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.037
Is Matthew Casey here?

18:04.792 --> 18:06.418
Yeah, he's right this way.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.594
How'd you get here?
I took the bus.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.638
What's going on?

18:19.724 --> 18:21.767
I just wanted to see
where my son works.

18:22.894 --> 18:23.977
This is where I work.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.063
Well, are you embarrassed
that I'm here?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.108
No. Of course not.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.694
Well, then can I get a tour?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.070
Yeah. Uh...

18:34.947 --> 18:35.822
Um...

18:36.699 --> 18:37.699
You saw the truck.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.243
This is your truck?
Yep.

18:40.411 --> 18:41.411
And, uh...

18:41.954 --> 18:43.622
Oh, this is Peter
behind you, Mom.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.749
This is Peter Mills,
our Candidate.

18:45.917 --> 18:46.958
This is my mom.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.668
Oh, hey!
Hi.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.420
Oh!
How are you?

18:50.588 --> 18:52.255
You've got a great son.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.466
That's very kind of you
to say.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.635
So... Oh!

18:56.803 --> 18:58.678
May I?
Oh, yes, please.
Help yourself.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.181
Thank you.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.184
Oh, this is, uh,
Gabriela Dawson.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.523
Oh, you...
You were at my hearing?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.653
Yes, that's right.
Oh.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.781
Thank you so much.
That just...
That meant the world to me,

19:17.949 --> 19:19.991
and I'm sure it did to
Matthew as well.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.869
Oh, ma'am, it was...
It was my pleasure

19:23.037 --> 19:25.038
and, uh,
congratulations for...

19:26.958 --> 19:28.375
Well, you know, uh,
getting out of...

19:29.669 --> 19:31.044
You know.

19:32.839 --> 19:33.922
Prison.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.298
Yeah! Yup.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.217
Prison. The Big House.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.552
The Big House, is it?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.179
They didn't call it
the Big House anymore?
Probably not, I'm guessing.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.890
Oh, she's adorable!

19:44.058 --> 19:46.935
She's an absolute joy!

19:48.020 --> 19:51.565
Forget Hallie. This is the
kind of woman I always
envisioned you being with.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.713
Have you given any more
thought to dinner on Sunday?

20:17.592 --> 20:19.217
I just got to tell my mom
if you're coming.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.555
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.
Dispatch has been
pounding us with runs.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.141
47's out of service.
So we've just been slammed.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.852
And, um, my cousin
might actually be
staying with me that...

20:29.020 --> 20:30.312
Are you nervous about dinner?

20:32.273 --> 20:33.607
Not at all. You?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.985
I mean, I'm the one who
extended the invitation, so...

20:38.029 --> 20:39.404
Yeah.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.114
Right. Of course.
No, I just, um...

20:41.282 --> 20:42.949
Am I getting in the way
of you and Casey?

20:45.953 --> 20:47.829
Absolutely not.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.414
He's just a friend.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.875
I'm only seeing you.
I only want to see you.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.880
I just wanna make sure
we're not moving
too quickly or anything.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.348
Text me. Let me know.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.900
Hey.
Hey.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.944
Why don't you tell Whaley
what happened?

21:21.238 --> 21:22.489
What difference
would it make?

21:22.990 --> 21:24.824
He'd get off your ass,
for one.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.039
Look, if I was gonna
say anything,

21:31.207 --> 21:32.707
I would have said
something then.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.960
Maybe he needs to know.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.963
You think I'm in a big hurry
to revisit the whole thing?

21:40.549 --> 21:43.093
It's over. It's done.
He can say what he wants.
I don't care.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.979
Lieutenant, I've got to talk
to you about Cruz.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.230
What about him?

21:55.398 --> 21:57.440
He's been acting
a little off.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.567
You notice that as well?

22:00.736 --> 22:02.862
I figured it was
a private matter.
Yeah?

22:03.030 --> 22:07.033
And I keep asking him
to tell me what it is,
but he won't open up.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.661
Then stop asking him about it,
Mouch.

22:12.623 --> 22:17.002
Ambulance 61,
person in distress,
Wallingford Motel.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.882
So why are you guys
keeping it on the sly?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.926
It started out being
what I wanted,

22:25.094 --> 22:27.178
but then Boden called
him on the carpet

22:27.346 --> 22:30.807
and gave him some vague BS
about putting the time in to
"master your craft,"

22:30.975 --> 22:32.267
and Mills really
took it to heart.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.311
I don't know,
if I dug someone
as much as you dig him,

22:35.479 --> 22:36.604
I wouldn't be
able to hide it.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.816
Especially working together,
24 hours a day,
side by side.

22:39.984 --> 22:40.942
Are you trying to
make me feel worse?

22:41.110 --> 22:42.610
Dawson,

22:42.778 --> 22:44.863
for someone who's such
a madwoman on the job,

22:45.031 --> 22:47.240
you are so timid
in your personal life.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.827
I mean, take some risks!
Have some fun!

22:53.539 --> 22:54.956
You know what? Thank you.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.792
Excellent point, which you
have made before, granted,

22:57.960 --> 23:01.004
but I'm at a place in my life
where I can really embrace
the message.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.422
I'm texting him right now.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.049
Nice!

23:04.800 --> 23:05.967
When's Clarice due?

23:06.135 --> 23:08.178
Oh! Two weeks.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.181
I'm getting butterflies.
Oh, plenty of time.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.099
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.601
I heard her scream,

23:14.769 --> 23:17.020
but we never have any
trouble around here.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.022
Nothing.
I hate hotels.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.901
Paramedics!

23:25.237 --> 23:26.738
Don't tell my wife.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.413
She took a hot shot.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.166
Okay, honey,
can you hear me?

23:43.172 --> 23:44.964
Agonal respiration.
She's barely breathing.

23:45.883 --> 23:46.925
Fight for us, girl.
Come on.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.135
You get your rocks off
watching girls shoot up?

23:49.303 --> 23:51.096
I never forced them
to do anything.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.098
That was completely
their thing.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.557
"Their"?

24:04.777 --> 24:05.944
There's another girl
in here.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.906
61 to Main,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.492
we need another ambulance.
And CPD for a DOA.

24:12.660 --> 24:13.827
Oh, God.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.287
I can't get a line in.
Her vein's collapsed.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.042
I'm gonna go sublingual.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.837
If this is the same
bad dope, we don't
have time for anything else.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.883
I can't get her jaw open.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.781
Come on, come on, come on.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.450
Come on, come on.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.249
Okay.
What's happening?

25:01.417 --> 25:03.751
You're okay. You're all right.
My name is Gabby.
This is Leslie.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.044
We're gonna get you
to the hospital, all right?

25:05.212 --> 25:07.046
Come on,
let's get on the chair.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.179
Man, this stuff is gonna
wipe out half the city.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.598
Hey. Antonio.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.896
Hey, Victoria,
it's me.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.063
What the hell happened?

25:24.231 --> 25:26.149
It wasn't enough for you to
hit this junk on your own?

25:26.317 --> 25:28.193
You had to bring Natalie
back into it?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.820
She was clean.
I told you to
stay away from her!

25:30.988 --> 25:31.905
Antonio!

25:35.159 --> 25:36.284
What's the problem?

25:37.328 --> 25:38.411
Hey!

25:39.079 --> 25:40.288
What the hell's going on?

25:44.001 --> 25:47.086
There's this new crew out of
New York that's been pushing
their way into prostitution,

25:47.254 --> 25:49.047
looking for a cut of
everyone's action.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.925
Those who don't pay,
their girls are getting hit
with bad dope.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.843
That's what's going on.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.970
That's who I'm trying
to bring down.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.349
And I'm trying to get close
to these animals

25:59.516 --> 26:02.644
but it's difficult when my
informants keep getting
spiked left and right.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.271
Okay, all right.
I get it, okay?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.065
But I've never seen you
like this before.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.650
You're starting to
worry me a little bit.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.986
You're keeping secrets
from your boss, you're
asking me to lie to mine.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.155
It's a little different
being a cop than
a paramedic, Gabby.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.950
There's a little more to it.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.919
I would've put on a pot
of coffee if I'd known
you were coming.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.506
If you knew I was coming,
this wouldn't be
an unannounced visit.

26:40.391 --> 26:42.350
Yeah, those...
Those are personal letters.

26:42.810 --> 26:45.520
As long as you're on parole,
nothing in here is personal.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.021
Yes, we understand, Officer.

26:47.856 --> 26:48.940
Thank you.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.651
Pretty straightforward, Nancy.

26:51.819 --> 26:55.321
You are to be in this house
from 9:00 p.m. To 9:00 a.m.
Every day.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.116
You are not to consume
alcohol or illegal drugs.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.910
You are not to associate
with any known criminals.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.621
And we have
an appointment

27:04.206 --> 27:06.874
on the 23rd in my office.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.210
It's yours to screw up.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.713
Well, then you have
nothing to worry about.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.263
Give me a second.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.016
Hey!
Can I call you right back?

27:23.851 --> 27:25.101
Okay.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.271
Rick?
Uh, no, I...

27:28.897 --> 27:29.897
I called that off.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.233
Why? He seemed nice.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.445
He was too nice.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.988
So then who was that
on the phone?

27:37.948 --> 27:39.615
Uh... A friend.

27:40.534 --> 27:41.993
Another pen pal?

27:43.078 --> 27:45.830
Wow,
You make it sound so tawdry,
but yeah.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.083
He was someone
kind enough to visit me
in prison.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.426
Morningside, huh?

27:58.969 --> 28:00.470
All right!
Yeah.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.723
Yeah, I've heard
all the speeches,
so, you know...

28:03.891 --> 28:05.808
Thanks all the same,
but you can save it.

28:05.976 --> 28:06.893
What speeches?

28:07.061 --> 28:09.103
"It's a dead house,
you're throwing
your career away,

28:09.271 --> 28:10.897
"all you're gonna do
is sell T-shirts."

28:11.065 --> 28:12.732
Oh, I don't have
any speeches.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.025
I made 100 bucks off this.

28:14.777 --> 28:15.902
What?

28:16.904 --> 28:18.029
What... What do you mean?

28:18.489 --> 28:19.989
Oh...

28:20.157 --> 28:22.325
When you first started,
there was a little
side action on

28:22.493 --> 28:24.827
if you had what it took
to make it at 51.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.037
I took the under,
so to speak.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.665
Well, who else
bet against me?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.918
It was
a confidential pool.
Hmm.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.878
Hey, you made it
four years, man.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.463
I'll give you that much.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.511
Okay, I get it.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.596
This is like a little
reverse psychology ploy

28:43.764 --> 28:46.140
to get me fired up
and make me stay, right?

28:56.944 --> 28:58.736
Son of a...

29:03.992 --> 29:06.077
Hey. You got a minute?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.459
I, uh...

29:15.921 --> 29:18.339
...was just a
little confused by
your text last night.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.007
Text?
Yeah.

29:21.552 --> 29:23.803
"You're right. I think
it's time to meet your mom,

29:23.971 --> 29:25.972
"and I'm really
looking forward to it."

29:28.809 --> 29:30.852
If I'm not mistaken,
you met her.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.061
Yeah.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.814
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I sent that before
she got there.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.566
That's so weird, 'cause I...

29:38.610 --> 29:40.653
That was...

29:41.447 --> 29:43.030
That was for somebody else.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.742
I'm sorry.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.120
Ah.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.166
That explains it.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.960
Ah, hey!

29:56.503 --> 29:58.588
Can I have everybody
in the briefing room?

29:58.755 --> 30:01.174
Moment of your time.
Thanks.

30:13.604 --> 30:15.021
As you can
see from the prospectus,

30:15.189 --> 30:16.939
the offer on the table
fluctuates

30:17.107 --> 30:21.152
based upon how many of us
get on board
with the actual offer.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.823
Now, it also entails
if the owner be carrying
the loan himself.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.367
70,000?
He'll never take it.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.829
Guys! Nothing ventured,
nothing gained!

30:32.289 --> 30:34.415
If he turns us down,
he turns us down.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.585
I'm just looking
for the seven K in cash

30:37.753 --> 30:39.212
to get the 10% down.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.172
Who's in?

30:44.593 --> 30:45.718
I'm in.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.137
Otis! Buddy!

30:48.764 --> 30:51.057
All right, we'll keep you
apprised while you're over
at Morningwood.

30:51.225 --> 30:53.809
Oh, no, no.
I'm actually happy
to announce

30:53.977 --> 30:57.313
to all you people who bet
that I wouldn't make it here,

30:58.398 --> 31:00.858
that I've withdrawn
my transfer request.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.405
Get out of here with that.
No one was bet against you.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.366
What?

31:11.161 --> 31:13.079
All right, look.
Anyone else?

31:13.247 --> 31:16.082
Look, it's a neighborhood bar
in Bucktown.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.251
We're looking to bring
in the new families
that have moved in

31:18.418 --> 31:20.628
and have thus far
been neglected.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.505
You're gonna
pass up a deal like this?

31:23.298 --> 31:25.091
Mouch.
Too volatile.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.344
All right, Mouch is out.
He thinks the bar is built
on a volcano.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.137
Anybody else?

31:31.640 --> 31:35.226
We're just looking
for one more to put
in $2,300 and we're whole.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.145
I'm in.

31:39.523 --> 31:40.690
Dawson.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.525
I'm making an investment.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.777
I've got to make money
to pay for med school, so...

31:45.696 --> 31:47.029
Are you crazy?

31:47.197 --> 31:48.781
What?

31:48.949 --> 31:50.116
Plus, it sounds like fun.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.828
So then just tell me
what happened.

31:53.996 --> 31:55.413
We've all...

31:58.458 --> 32:00.084
- How is this your business?
- How is this my business?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.294
Yes! How is it
your business?

32:01.461 --> 32:02.712
It wasn't just Renee's life
you screwed up.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.338
It was our whole family.
Look!

32:05.340 --> 32:07.174
I moved on
with my life, okay?

32:09.595 --> 32:11.178
Maybe you should, too.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.268
Tell me, how do you move on

32:17.436 --> 32:19.854
from seeing your sister's car
wrapped around
a telephone pole, huh?

32:21.481 --> 32:23.024
Come on.
Yeah.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.151
Yeah, yeah.
Your boy here,

32:25.736 --> 32:27.737
the great Kelly Severide.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.032
After he dumps my sister,
she goes out drinking,

32:31.742 --> 32:33.784
ends up in a coma
for three months.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.079
Where was Kelly?

32:40.125 --> 32:41.876
Never heard from him.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.547
Your sister hooked up
with an ex-boyfriend
before the wedding.

32:46.715 --> 32:47.757
Shay.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.300
No. He needs to know this.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.677
Kelly found out about it,
so he called off the wedding.

32:51.845 --> 32:54.597
And he didn't
say anything
because your entire family

32:54.765 --> 32:56.974
was in the hospital
after Renee hit that pole.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.976
He didn't wanna dump
more grief on you guys.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.437
So he took the hit.

33:02.773 --> 33:05.733
That's what happened,
all right? So lay off.

33:10.864 --> 33:11.739
Shay.

33:14.076 --> 33:15.284
Hospital just called.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.829
Clarice's water just broke.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.790
Thanks.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.555
Anything else need to be said
beyond what's already been
screamed or yelled?

33:37.057 --> 33:38.724
No, Chief.
Nope.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.894
You gonna make it another
three shifts?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.522
Or do I need to
find you a new home?

33:45.982 --> 33:47.566
I like to fulfill
my obligations.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.862
So yeah, I'd like
to stay until I'm done.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.573
You got a problem
with that, Kelly?

33:54.741 --> 33:55.783
I don't.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.412
Eric,

33:59.579 --> 34:01.497
I have been on vacation
for the past few weeks,

34:01.665 --> 34:03.374
so you probably
haven't got a chance

34:04.000 --> 34:05.584
to know how I operate.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.087
I say things once.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.798
Copy that.

34:13.343 --> 34:14.969
Both of you,
back to work.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.948
Part of my frustration,
I guess, is that

34:37.159 --> 34:39.076
I don't know
where she is
half the time.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.666
She doesn't really talk
to the family any more.

34:58.764 --> 34:59.805
Deal.

34:59.973 --> 35:01.432
Ah, that's amazing.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.683
Yes!
Thank you so much.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.894
You guys saved my life.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.438
If you want the place,
it's yours.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.773
Wow.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.649
Thank you.
Okay.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.942
I just got two favors.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.903
Name it.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.489
Don't turn this place into
some kind of hipster joint

35:16.656 --> 35:18.741
that caters to
all these new arrivals.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.034
Are you kidding me?
Hell no.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.994
Just keep the charm.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.705
You have our word
that we will
bend over backwards

35:24.873 --> 35:26.123
to try and
accommodate that.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.293
Oh, you said you had
a second favor?

35:29.836 --> 35:31.128
Oh, yeah.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.089
I promised someone else
a little taste,
if you know what I mean.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.384
Strictly off the books,
depending on what
he brings to the table,

35:37.928 --> 35:39.970
but it's your call
as to what size
that piece will be.

35:40.764 --> 35:41.847
We're not...

35:42.015 --> 35:44.475
We're not really looking
for any more partners.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.894
Relax, sweetheart.
He's a silent partner.

35:48.605 --> 35:49.814
Just take care of him.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.650
Sorry I'm late,
Mister Stephanides.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.985
No problem, Arthur.
Come on in.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.030
Arthur's crew
boarded the place
up after the fire,

35:58.782 --> 35:59.865
free of charge.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.452
You're going to
get along just great.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.924
Uh, what are you doing?

36:18.093 --> 36:18.759
I'm going out.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.261
To do what?

36:21.221 --> 36:23.097
Have dinner.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.058
With this pen pal guy?

36:26.685 --> 36:27.935
Yes indeedy.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.689
Your parole officer
said that you...

36:31.857 --> 36:33.983
I'll be back
before my curfew.
Don't worry about it.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.110
I'm worried about it, Mom.

36:36.278 --> 36:37.778
You're not even
24 hours into being...

36:37.946 --> 36:39.947
I am not going out
to sell crack!

36:42.492 --> 36:45.286
I thought you invited
me into your home
so I could live my life.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.996
But if your intention
was to parent me or,

36:47.163 --> 36:49.748
or somehow get back at me
for what happened,

36:49.916 --> 36:50.875
then you shouldn't
have bothered.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.626
Whoa, whoa, whoa... hold up.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.672
Nobody talks to me
like that, all right?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.758
Especially in my own house.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.684
I'm going to have dinner,
Matthew.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.147
I'll be back
before my curfew.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.191
I hope you have
a wonderful night.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.940
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

38:01.363 --> 38:02.446
Hey.

38:03.490 --> 38:04.406
It's a boy.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.116
All right!

38:06.284 --> 38:07.701
Come on.

38:07.869 --> 38:11.580
Oh, God, he's healthy,
beautiful, adorable cheeks.

38:11.748 --> 38:12.831
He can't wait
to meet you.

38:12.999 --> 38:13.958
Yeah?
Yeah.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.838
Sorry about that
back at the firehouse.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.633
No, you're not.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.054
Hi.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.649
It's amazing.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.617
Daniel.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.169
Do you want to hold him?

39:20.608 --> 39:23.235
I don't know what
your plans are, but, um,

39:24.112 --> 39:26.447
of course I'd love for you
to be a part of our lives

39:26.614 --> 39:28.323
as much as you can.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.343
Wow.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.305
Father of the Year,
right there.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.645
Clarice Carthage
and Leslie Shay?

39:59.606 --> 40:00.689
Yes?

40:00.857 --> 40:04.526
You've been served in
the case of Daniel Schwartz
versus Clarice Carthage.

40:10.909 --> 40:11.825
What is it?

40:13.244 --> 40:14.870
Petition for full custody.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.386
It's okay.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.847
Oh, my God.
You're not answering.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.099
I hope that's good news.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.017
Um, I'm in the parking lot.
I'm sorry I'm late.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.435
Be there in a sec.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.315
Hey, what are you
doing here?
Hey.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.568
Hey, Antonio!
What's wrong?

40:48.822 --> 40:50.072
The girl you brought in,
the 'OD.'

40:50.740 --> 40:51.907
Victoria.

40:52.826 --> 40:53.617
She bolted.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.953
Nobody's seen her
for at least an hour.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.623
All right, well,
what's up?

41:00.708 --> 41:03.043
The DOA was
my informant for years

41:03.211 --> 41:04.670
and I was going
to start over
with Victoria.

41:04.838 --> 41:05.796
Now she's gone.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.215
Antonio, you need
some rest, okay?

41:08.383 --> 41:09.341
You're barely
making any sense.

41:09.509 --> 41:10.884
Let me take you home.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.845
I got to go.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.695
Oh, God.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.613
Oh, God, Antonio!

41:34.742 --> 41:35.951
Antonio!

41:37.162 --> 41:39.288
Antonio! Oh, God!

41:40.039 --> 41:41.999
Come on. Come on!

41:43.710 --> 41:45.169
Oh, God!

41:47.255 --> 41:48.589
Come on!
You hear me?
Hold on.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.341
Somebody, help!

41:53.511 --> 41:55.137
Hold on.
I've got you.
I've got you.

41:55.305 --> 41:56.805
You're going to be fine.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.974
Help!

42:00.435 --> 42:02.144
Somebody help me!
