WEBVTT

00:08.624 --> 00:10.292
What a day!

00:10.359 --> 00:13.628
Binford's executive
schlockmeister, Morgan Wandell,

00:13.696 --> 00:17.265
wants me to do a whole
<i>Tool Time</i> just talking.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.868
No tools, no projects,
no hands-on anything!

00:20.936 --> 00:23.238
Isn't that insane?

00:23.306 --> 00:25.473
How many "P's" in "deposit"?

00:27.009 --> 00:28.076
Two!

00:30.012 --> 00:31.879
I was right.

00:31.947 --> 00:33.281
Now more about me...

00:33.349 --> 00:34.916
No. Sorry, man.
I can't. I'm in a hurry.

00:34.983 --> 00:37.885
I gotta go put a security deposit
down on my new apartment.

00:37.953 --> 00:39.220
Brad, listen to this...

00:39.288 --> 00:41.026
Actually, Dad, can you
talk to me about it later?

00:41.056 --> 00:42.361
I have a 5:00 hair
appointment at Pablo's.

00:42.391 --> 00:43.529
He gets all weird when I'm late.

00:43.559 --> 00:44.859
Pablo?

00:44.926 --> 00:46.694
He's more important
than your dad?

00:46.762 --> 00:48.563
Dad, he cuts my hair.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.634
Hey, Mark,
you gotta listen to this.

00:53.702 --> 00:56.971
Sure. As soon as I'm done
watching this show.

00:57.039 --> 01:01.042
You're watching <i>Cooking
with the Ragin' Cajun?</i>

01:01.110 --> 01:02.910
Dad, it's Gumbo Week.

01:04.813 --> 01:07.215
Hi. How was
your day, honey?

01:07.283 --> 01:08.549
Terrible. Terrible.

01:08.617 --> 01:10.555
- Why? What happened?
- Sit down and I'll tell you.

01:10.585 --> 01:13.154
Morgan Wandell now is taking
complete control of the show, right?

01:13.222 --> 01:14.693
- Yeah.
- I'm used to things being my way.

01:14.723 --> 01:16.683
I'm not gonna take orders
from a cheesy young punk

01:16.725 --> 01:18.063
- who thinks he knows production.
- Hey, Mom?

01:18.093 --> 01:19.331
- We're talking.
- It's Professor Hanover's office.

01:19.361 --> 01:20.632
- We're talking.
- Dr. Hanover? Wait.

01:20.662 --> 01:22.267
Just hold that thought.
I just have to take this call.

01:22.297 --> 01:23.964
Hello?

01:24.833 --> 01:25.933
Yeah.

01:26.001 --> 01:27.335
Yeah.

01:27.403 --> 01:31.605
Yeah, I can have a meeting with Dr.
Hanover, Thursday, 2:00.

01:36.778 --> 01:41.149
Can you tell me what
this meeting is about?

01:41.216 --> 01:45.520
Well, I guess I'll just have to
find out when I get there. Okay.

01:45.587 --> 01:47.488
All right. Thanks. Bye.

01:48.657 --> 01:50.058
Howdy.

01:50.125 --> 01:51.630
Dr. Hanover wants to have
a meeting with me.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.061
That's great.
Anyway, this guy...

01:53.128 --> 01:54.628
No, it's not great.
I mean,

01:54.696 --> 01:56.601
maybe he reread my thesis and
he's having second thoughts.

01:56.631 --> 01:58.066
Honey? Honey, please?

01:58.133 --> 01:59.405
Maybe he found a reference
that's outdated.

01:59.435 --> 02:00.706
- You know, that can happen.
- Could you just...

02:00.736 --> 02:02.441
Just hold on a second.
Let me tell you this.

02:02.471 --> 02:04.743
Maybe he thinks that my conclusions
are just, you know, inconclusive.

02:04.773 --> 02:06.040
Oh, God!

02:07.876 --> 02:10.311
This could be terrible
for my whole career.

02:10.378 --> 02:11.879
I just have to calm down.

02:12.381 --> 02:13.548
Calm down.

02:13.616 --> 02:15.416
I'm gonna go take a hot bath.

02:15.484 --> 02:17.152
Thanks for listening.

02:17.219 --> 02:20.955
I'm gonna go stick
my head in the microwave.

02:21.023 --> 02:23.458
With my mouth open
so it doesn't explode.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074

03:13.642 --> 03:16.845
Sorry I'm late.
I was packing up Mother's house.

03:16.912 --> 03:18.513
That must've been
hard for you, Al.

03:18.581 --> 03:21.115
Well, I got through it okay.

03:21.183 --> 03:22.717
But then Trudy came over,

03:22.785 --> 03:26.621
and we were going over the
guest list for the wedding.

03:26.689 --> 03:28.956
And I got this panic attack!

03:29.024 --> 03:31.426
I think I'm going through
pre-marital stress.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.494
Ah, PMS.

03:35.263 --> 03:37.132
I just... You know,

03:37.199 --> 03:39.100
I need to get through
the next two days.

03:39.168 --> 03:42.637
You know, come Monday
I'll be on my honeymoon,

03:42.704 --> 03:44.572
lying on the beach with Trudy,

03:44.639 --> 03:48.943
slathering zinc oxide
all over my body.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.078
Boy, thanks for that image.

03:52.781 --> 03:54.849
Hey, guys.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.618
Excited about my big idea
for today's show?

03:57.686 --> 04:01.356
How can we be excited about a
show where we just talk, Morgan?

04:01.490 --> 04:03.457
No, no. It's not just talk.
It's Tim talk.

04:03.525 --> 04:06.394
And when Tim talks,
people listen.

04:06.461 --> 04:08.128
Don't kiss up to me.

04:08.197 --> 04:10.931
That job is reserved
for Borland.

04:10.999 --> 04:14.101
Yeah. You're gonna have
to stand in line, pal.

04:16.438 --> 04:18.005
Does everybody know
what time it is?

04:18.072 --> 04:19.606
<i>Tool Time!</i>

04:19.673 --> 04:21.379
That's right!
Binford Tools is proud to present

04:21.409 --> 04:24.011
Tim "The Binford
Tool Man" Taylor!

04:29.951 --> 04:30.951
Thank you.

04:34.856 --> 04:36.290
Thank you.

04:37.626 --> 04:39.360
Thank you, Binford's Heidi.

04:39.428 --> 04:41.662
I am Tim "The Binford
Tool Man" Taylor,

04:41.730 --> 04:45.600
and of course, you all know my
assistant Al "Binford" Borland.

04:47.169 --> 04:48.736
Thank you.

04:48.803 --> 04:51.172
Well, you may not
like the show today.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.677
We're doing something
a bit different.

04:52.707 --> 04:54.379
There's no project.
We're not gonna build anything.

04:54.409 --> 04:56.710
We're just going to talk.

04:56.778 --> 05:00.048
If you have any complaints about
that, you might want to e-mail

05:00.115 --> 05:03.918
Morgan Wandell
at bigfatzero.com.

05:07.122 --> 05:10.958
Today's show is called
"Home Repair Addicts."

05:11.026 --> 05:14.095
Men who can't keep
their hands off their tools.

05:17.332 --> 05:19.666
Apparently, we've got
three good buddies

05:19.734 --> 05:23.104
who are accused of having a tool
addiction that they cannot kick.

05:23.171 --> 05:26.107
So I guess, Heidi, it's time to
bring out our tool addicts, please.

05:26.174 --> 05:30.812
All right, let's have a big Binford
welcome to Robby, Dan and Butch.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.113
Hi, Robby.
How're you doing?

05:32.181 --> 05:33.181
Thank you for being here.

05:33.248 --> 05:34.248
Hey, Al.

05:34.316 --> 05:37.118
Hey, Dan. Nice to see you.

05:37.186 --> 05:38.886
Please make
yourselves comfortable.

05:38.954 --> 05:40.754
Thank you.

05:40.822 --> 05:42.957
Well, gentlemen,
I gotta be honest with you.

05:43.024 --> 05:45.431
I don't see anything wrong with
men that like to build things.

05:45.461 --> 05:48.563
So I would like to know
what the problem is.

05:48.630 --> 05:50.698
My wife.

05:50.765 --> 05:52.266
Been there.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.406
You had better hope she's not
watching this show today, huh?

05:54.436 --> 05:55.769
Actually,
they're in the audience.

05:55.837 --> 05:57.738
Huh?

05:57.806 --> 05:59.407
This could get interesting.

05:59.541 --> 06:00.861
Well, Robby,
why don't you tell us

06:00.909 --> 06:03.311
what happens in your house
when you open your toolbox?

06:03.378 --> 06:05.813
- First I might fix the hinge on a window.
- Uh-huh.

06:05.881 --> 06:09.450
Then if the mood strikes me, I might
replace the drywall next to it.

06:09.517 --> 06:11.618
Then as long as I'm
replacing the drywall,

06:11.686 --> 06:14.255
I might as well
add on a family room.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.424
That sounds sensible to me.

06:17.492 --> 06:18.760
Sensible?

06:18.827 --> 06:21.662
We have six family rooms
and no family!

06:24.767 --> 06:27.234
Well, I guess
it's time to get busy!

06:28.570 --> 06:29.804
Dan, what's your problem?

06:29.871 --> 06:31.238
Uh, I like to paint.

06:31.306 --> 06:32.606
But I don't have an addiction.

06:32.674 --> 06:35.376
I can stop anytime I want.

06:35.443 --> 06:36.610
Oh, yeah?

06:36.678 --> 06:39.247
Then how come our front
lawn is now blue?

06:41.149 --> 06:42.549
It's teal.

06:43.651 --> 06:44.718
Butch,

06:44.786 --> 06:46.687
why don't you tell us all
what you're into?

06:46.754 --> 06:47.889
Lubrication.

06:50.859 --> 06:53.528
I believe a good home
is a quiet home.

06:53.595 --> 06:55.329
No squeaks, creaks or hums.

06:55.397 --> 06:57.665
So, I always keep a can
or two of oil on hand.

06:57.733 --> 07:00.868
A can or two?
He oils everything we own.

07:00.936 --> 07:02.270
He's like the... Tin Man.

07:02.337 --> 07:04.071
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:04.139 --> 07:06.140
Let's just try to
settle down, okay?

07:06.208 --> 07:09.043
Tim's right. We don't allow
off-color language on this show.

07:09.110 --> 07:11.779
That's right, Sue.
So, shut your... mouth.

07:13.448 --> 07:16.317
Oh, yeah? ...and the...
horse you rode in on.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.654
Hey, Wandell!
Do something about this.

07:19.722 --> 07:21.556
Yeah, you go, girl!

07:21.623 --> 07:25.059
I'm so sick of your crappy repairs!
And I'm sick of you!

07:25.127 --> 07:26.231
You know, ma'am,
if you would just...

07:26.261 --> 07:28.262
Oh, pipe down, Bones!

07:28.330 --> 07:30.898
Hey, hey, hey, hey... Now, just...
Calm down. Calm down.

07:30.966 --> 07:32.567
It's a television show.
Come on.

07:32.634 --> 07:37.204
If you go back to your seat,
you'll get that nylon fanny pack.

07:37.272 --> 07:41.308
She doesn't need one. She's
already packing plenty of fanny.

07:41.510 --> 07:43.978
Now, that's not helping matters, sir.
If we could just...

07:44.046 --> 07:47.014
Hey, well,
I've got news for you.

07:47.082 --> 07:50.484
My fanny's good enough
for the Dutch boy.

07:50.552 --> 07:54.088
He and I have been... brains
out for the last six months.

07:54.156 --> 07:55.222
What?

08:00.596 --> 08:02.797
That's not very ladylike!

08:07.503 --> 08:09.437
Somebody call security!

08:12.073 --> 08:14.809
We'll be right
back after these...

08:17.512 --> 08:19.546
Awesome show, guys!

08:19.614 --> 08:20.719
What do you mean,
"awesome show"?

08:20.749 --> 08:22.383
I almost got killed out there!

08:22.450 --> 08:24.018
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

08:24.085 --> 08:26.224
Those gals were only supposed
to threaten their husbands.

08:26.254 --> 08:27.454
They were supposed to?

08:27.522 --> 08:29.556
Are you saying that
this show was staged?

08:29.624 --> 08:31.492
Yeah. Yeah.
It looked so real, didn't it?

08:31.559 --> 08:33.227
Oh, God, I'm good!

08:35.663 --> 08:40.967
Morgan, you have made a mockery of
everything Channel 112 stands for.

08:41.035 --> 08:42.407
We're not doing any
more shows like this!

08:42.437 --> 08:43.837
Yeah!

08:43.905 --> 08:45.873
No. No, no. Of course not.
We want to stay fresh.

08:45.940 --> 08:47.841
We keep the audience guessing.

08:47.909 --> 08:51.245
Eventually, we'll do some more
of that building crap you like.

08:51.312 --> 08:54.248
Building crap?
Hold on a second.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.883
That building crap...
That building crap is

08:56.951 --> 08:59.720
what <i>Tool Time</i> has been
about for the last 10 years.

08:59.787 --> 09:02.156
All right. Well, now
it's about ratings.

09:02.224 --> 09:05.659
And if you're not comfortable
with that, we can go another way.

09:05.727 --> 09:07.495
What's that supposed to mean?

09:07.562 --> 09:10.268
Well, it means that we can find a host
that's on the same page that we are.

09:10.298 --> 09:12.065
Ooh. Are you threatening
me, Morgan?

09:12.134 --> 09:14.735
No. No, I'm just clarifying
Binford's position.

09:14.802 --> 09:16.403
Well, let me clarify
my position.

09:16.471 --> 09:18.239
You're not gonna take control
of <i>Tool Time.</i>

09:18.306 --> 09:19.944
- Yeah. I'm with Tim.
- Yeah. You tell him, Tim.

09:19.974 --> 09:22.514
That's right. If I have to, I'll
just go above you. I'll talk to Bud.

09:22.544 --> 09:24.578
All right. Well, you can
talk to Bud all you want.

09:24.646 --> 09:25.812
- I'm going to.
- Well, do.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.552
- It's not gonna do you much good.
- Sure it will.

09:27.582 --> 09:29.450
Well, he's no longer
with the company.

09:29.517 --> 09:31.219
What?
Hold on a second.

09:31.286 --> 09:34.021
Bud wouldn't leave <i>Tool Time</i>
without letting me know.

09:34.089 --> 09:37.492
Let's see. He left,
you didn't know about it.

09:37.559 --> 09:40.127
I guess he would leave
without telling you.

09:40.195 --> 09:44.465
Well, as far as supervising <i>Tool Time</i>
is concerned, who is above you now?

09:44.532 --> 09:45.599
God.

09:47.836 --> 09:52.139
Well, look, if you're gonna turn
this show into a three-ring circus,

09:52.207 --> 09:54.041
I might just quit.

09:54.109 --> 09:56.010
Sorry to lose you.

09:56.078 --> 09:58.112
You were a good man.

10:08.690 --> 10:10.224
Jill, we gotta talk.

10:10.292 --> 10:12.564
No, honey, I can't. I gotta go to
this meeting with Dr. Hanover.

10:12.594 --> 10:14.700
- This is very important, honey.
- Well, okay. So, what is it?

10:14.730 --> 10:16.535
Like, Morgan? He wants you to
do another cheesy <i>Tool Time</i>

10:16.565 --> 10:17.998
and you don't
want to do it, right?

10:18.066 --> 10:19.571
No. He wants all <i>Tool Times</i>
to be cheesy.

10:19.601 --> 10:23.237
That's why tomorrow is my
last show, 'cause I quit.

10:23.304 --> 10:25.039
You quit?
You quit the show?

10:25.106 --> 10:26.840
He pushed me too far.

10:26.909 --> 10:30.144
Today's show was one of those shock
TV shows like <i>Jerry Springer.</i>

10:30.212 --> 10:33.714
Tomorrow he wants me to
start an electrical fire!

10:33.782 --> 10:38.585
I intentionally start fires,
I lose all credibility!

10:38.653 --> 10:40.955
Well, I think...
Why don't you just talk to Bud?

10:41.023 --> 10:42.723
Bud left the company,

10:42.791 --> 10:45.359
put Morgan in charge.
He's completely insane.

10:45.427 --> 10:46.994
Al and Heidi quit
right after I did.

10:47.062 --> 10:48.963
Oh, my God!

10:49.031 --> 10:50.965
Then this is for real.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.233
Darn right it's for real.

10:53.368 --> 10:55.469
We figure we owe it to our
fans to do one more show.

10:55.536 --> 10:58.072
But after tomorrow's show,
I'm done.

10:59.774 --> 11:01.475
I am so sorry.

11:02.777 --> 11:05.613
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

11:05.680 --> 11:08.249
That's 10 years of my life.
I loved that show.

11:08.316 --> 11:10.884
I just hope
I can land on my feet.

11:10.952 --> 11:13.487
What are we gonna do for money?

11:13.555 --> 11:14.595
We've got some in savings.

11:14.656 --> 11:15.790
Yeah.

11:15.857 --> 11:17.617
I can put in more time
at the hardware store.

11:17.659 --> 11:20.728
That's a way to spend money.

11:20.796 --> 11:23.464
I'll buy a garage and start
a classic car shop.

11:23.532 --> 11:25.399
You can't start
a business from scratch.

11:25.467 --> 11:28.569
There's gonna be experts out there
that have been doing it for years.

11:28.637 --> 11:30.371
It could take forever
to turn a profit.

11:30.439 --> 11:34.608
Or, you know, you could just be a
complete failure right out of the box.

11:37.112 --> 11:39.646
You're gonna make
a great therapist.

11:42.550 --> 11:44.218
Oh, hello, Jill.
Come on in.

11:44.285 --> 11:45.785
Hi. Um...

11:45.853 --> 11:47.354
When your secretary called,

11:47.422 --> 11:49.289
she wouldn't tell me what
this meeting's about.

11:49.524 --> 11:50.696
That's because she doesn't know.

11:50.726 --> 11:52.326
If I tell her anything
involving a woman,

11:52.361 --> 11:53.694
she thinks I'm having an affair.

11:53.762 --> 11:56.931
Well, that's ridiculous.

11:56.999 --> 11:59.700
Well, not that any woman wouldn't
want to have an affair with you.

11:59.768 --> 12:02.068
- It's just, you know...
- Sit down. Sit down.

12:03.938 --> 12:08.742
Jill, I called you in to tell you that
I have recommended you for a job.

12:08.810 --> 12:10.311
You... You did? Me?

12:10.378 --> 12:13.246
You remember our guest lecturer, Dr.
Ted Lee?

12:13.315 --> 12:15.287
Yes, I do. He wrote that great
book on family counseling.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.851
Yeah. Well, he just
opened a family clinic.

12:17.919 --> 12:22.389
And he wants you to work for him in
his adolescent development program.

12:22.457 --> 12:24.625
This is unbelievable.
He wants me?

12:24.692 --> 12:26.898
Well, he liked the idea of
hiring a post-graduate student.

12:26.928 --> 12:30.230
And he wanted someone
with life experience.

12:30.298 --> 12:33.166
This is so great. You can't
imagine how good the timing is...

12:33.234 --> 12:34.973
Well, there is one thing
that you should know.

12:35.003 --> 12:37.438
How much money will I be making?

12:39.341 --> 12:40.574
- Excuse me?
- Cash. Dollars.

12:40.642 --> 12:42.410
How much will I be pulling down?

12:42.477 --> 12:45.846
Jill, people don't usually take these
entry-level jobs for the money.

12:45.914 --> 12:47.381
Oh. Oh, of course not.

12:47.449 --> 12:50.183
But I might eventually make,
say, what you make?

12:50.319 --> 12:53.921
People don't take my job
for the money.

12:53.923 --> 12:56.590
Look, I'm sorry.
I just...

12:56.658 --> 12:58.659
My husband lost his job today.

12:58.727 --> 13:01.962
So I'm just a little concerned
about our financial situation.

13:02.029 --> 13:03.897
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:03.966 --> 13:06.600
Well, you know, I don't know
exactly what the salary would be.

13:06.668 --> 13:10.103
But I'm sure it won't be enough
to support a family of five.

13:10.171 --> 13:12.539
Ah. Well, that's okay.

13:12.607 --> 13:15.213
You know, I'm just confident that Tim
will be able to get another job.

13:15.243 --> 13:19.046
And this is a really wonderful opportunity.
Thank you so much.

13:19.114 --> 13:20.981
Oh, you're very welcome.

13:21.116 --> 13:23.984
But what I'm trying to tell you is that Dr.
Lee's clinic is in Indiana.

13:24.051 --> 13:25.919
You'd have to move.

13:29.257 --> 13:30.991
Move?

13:31.059 --> 13:34.494
Before you ask me what it costs
to rent a U-Haul, I don't know!

13:37.598 --> 13:40.167
Okay, that's great news.
Yeah. Yeah.

13:40.235 --> 13:41.969
I'll call you back. Thanks.

13:42.036 --> 13:44.571
Yes!

13:44.639 --> 13:47.440
Jill, you're not gonna believe this.
Sparky found a vacant spot

13:47.508 --> 13:49.948
in Woodridge that would be perfect
for a classic car showroom.

13:49.978 --> 13:53.080
Well, I have another location
in mind.

13:54.582 --> 13:57.284
How about opening
a shop in Indiana?

13:58.720 --> 14:03.157
"Indiana wants me.
Lord, I can't go back there."

14:03.224 --> 14:06.227
Honey, a very prestigious
colleague of Dr. Hanover's

14:06.294 --> 14:08.729
has offered me a job at his
family clinic in Bloomington.

14:08.796 --> 14:13.967
Must be a pretty screwed up family
if they have their own clinic.

14:14.035 --> 14:18.405
This is really an incredible opportunity
for me. This man is amazing.

14:18.472 --> 14:20.007
You're serious about
moving to Indiana?

14:20.075 --> 14:23.477
Yeah... Well, I don't know.
I mean, I want to consider it.

14:23.544 --> 14:25.913
What are they
offering you? Ballpark.

14:25.980 --> 14:27.915
Well, I...
It's not much.

14:27.983 --> 14:29.850
But there's potential
for more later.

14:29.918 --> 14:33.988
Honey, honey, we're not moving to
Indiana based on potential, okay?

14:35.490 --> 14:37.062
Well, you're not even
gonna discuss this?

14:37.092 --> 14:39.593
What's to discuss?
We live here.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.996
I mean, my mom is here,
my brothers are here.

14:42.063 --> 14:43.931
My mechanics are here.

14:45.566 --> 14:48.835
So, we're just gonna throw my
career out the door because

14:48.904 --> 14:50.670
you don't want a stranger
to change your oil?

14:50.939 --> 14:54.074
Give me some credit! There's
more to it than that!

14:54.142 --> 14:58.245
How am I gonna follow the Lions,
the Redwings, the Pistons?

14:58.313 --> 14:59.747
Buy a paper!

14:59.815 --> 15:02.483
I don't want to read!

15:02.551 --> 15:04.618
I'm not leaving this house.
I built this house.

15:04.686 --> 15:08.989
And I'm not moving because you decide
on a whim to go to Hoosierville!

15:09.057 --> 15:12.693
It's not a whim. And I didn't say I want
to move. I just want to discuss it.

15:12.861 --> 15:15.395
Okay, let's discuss it.
We're not moving.

15:17.232 --> 15:19.265
I can't believe this.

15:19.333 --> 15:22.002
For 20 years my whole life has
revolved around your career,

15:22.069 --> 15:25.071
and I finally have an
opportunity to start my own

15:25.139 --> 15:27.040
and you don't even have one.

15:27.108 --> 15:28.576
That's a low blow.

15:29.644 --> 15:31.211
It could get lower.

15:35.817 --> 15:37.050
Hey, Wilson.

15:37.118 --> 15:38.719
Well, hi-ho, Tim.

15:38.787 --> 15:39.920
What are you doing?

15:39.987 --> 15:41.988
Just hosing off my rocks.

15:44.726 --> 15:48.562
If your shower's broken,
you can use ours.

15:48.629 --> 15:51.069
No. No, no, no, no, Tim. I'm
washing the rocks that I gathered

15:51.132 --> 15:54.034
on my hiking trip
to Whitefish Point.

15:54.102 --> 15:55.603
So, what's going on with you?

15:55.670 --> 15:58.339
Well, for starters,
I quit my job.

15:58.406 --> 16:02.442
<i>Tim, you quit Tool Time
after 10 years?</i>

16:02.510 --> 16:05.012
They were making too many
changes, Wilson. I just...

16:05.080 --> 16:07.047
I just had to let it go.

16:07.115 --> 16:09.583
<i>Well, I am sorry to hear that.</i>

16:09.650 --> 16:11.418
It gets worse.

16:11.486 --> 16:15.122
I told Jill I quit and she told
me she wants to move to Indiana.

16:15.190 --> 16:18.192
<i>Jill is leaving you
because you lost your job?</i>

16:20.161 --> 16:23.897
No, no, no. She was offered
a position in Bloomington.

16:23.965 --> 16:28.168
<i>Oh. I'm gathering you didn't
take too kindly to that.</i>

16:28.236 --> 16:30.971
I didn't even
want to discuss it.

16:31.038 --> 16:32.740
You know, abandon my mom
and my brothers.

16:32.807 --> 16:35.876
Uproot my boys in a critical
time in their development.

16:35.943 --> 16:38.044
<i>You don't want to
leave your mechanics.</i>

16:38.946 --> 16:41.482
It's not just my mechanics.

16:41.549 --> 16:44.685
You know, it's Barry Sanders, and
Grant Hill, and the riverfront,

16:44.753 --> 16:46.353
and Polish food, and...

16:46.421 --> 16:48.656
And my barber...

16:49.791 --> 16:51.392
And it's a change.
It's a big change.

16:51.459 --> 16:55.362
<i>Well, change is often
difficult for everybody, Tim.</i>

16:55.430 --> 16:59.199
<i>But on the other hand, if you
are gonna leave Tool Time,</i>

16:59.267 --> 17:02.069
<i>this might be a good time
for you to support Jill.</i>

17:02.071 --> 17:07.741
The truth is my family has always
been based around me and my career.

17:07.808 --> 17:10.810
I never really thought about what
would happen if... You know...

17:10.878 --> 17:13.347
<i>You never thought you'd be making
the same sacrifices for Jill</i>

17:13.414 --> 17:14.848
<i>as she did for you.</i>

17:14.915 --> 17:18.417
Yeah... That's it. Yeah.

17:18.486 --> 17:21.387
<i>You know, Tim, these are perfectly
normal feelings you're having.</i>

17:21.455 --> 17:24.791
<i>Traditionally, the male is
the leader of the family.</i>

17:24.858 --> 17:28.028
<i>It's very difficult for him to give
up that position to the female.</i>

17:28.096 --> 17:29.463
Oh.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.532
There's a nasty thought.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.901
Me in hair curlers,

17:34.969 --> 17:37.371
little muumuu,
walking around the house.

17:39.241 --> 17:41.408
You think we should
make the move?

17:41.475 --> 17:44.411
<i>I would never want to
lose you as a neighbor.</i>

17:45.847 --> 17:49.082
<i>But you and Jill have to do
what's best for you two.</i>

17:49.818 --> 17:51.318
Yeah, we do.

17:51.385 --> 17:52.619
<i>You do.</i>

17:54.088 --> 17:58.559
<i>Well, I guess I better get
back to hosing off my rocks.</i>

18:01.395 --> 18:05.265
Yeah. And I better get back
inside and try to save mine.

18:12.039 --> 18:14.074
I don't want to go to Indiana.

18:14.141 --> 18:15.776
- Yeah. Me either.
- Neither will Randy.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.915
Have you even talked
to him about it?

18:16.945 --> 18:18.044
Not yet.

18:18.112 --> 18:20.347
I don't think he wants
to leave Costa Rica.

18:20.414 --> 18:24.718
I think some tribe found out he had a
flashlight and turned him into a god.

18:26.654 --> 18:29.356
You know, I can't think of one
good thing about Indiana.

18:29.423 --> 18:31.858
They have a town
named French Lick.

18:37.198 --> 18:39.999
Will it be easy for you just
to pick up and leave Detroit?

18:40.068 --> 18:43.002
No! It wasn't easy for me to
quit <i>Tool Time</i>, but I did that.

18:43.070 --> 18:45.606
Yeah. Just when it was
starting to get good.

18:45.673 --> 18:48.441
Women were
body-slamming each other!

18:49.077 --> 18:52.412
Like I said...

18:52.480 --> 18:55.482
The most important thing about a move
to Indiana would be for your mom.

18:55.549 --> 18:58.051
She's worked really hard
on this new career.

18:58.119 --> 19:01.121
And this is a really good
opportunity for her.

19:02.757 --> 19:04.124
I don't know, Dad.

19:04.126 --> 19:06.894
I just want you to consider it.

19:06.961 --> 19:08.061
What's going on, guys?

19:08.129 --> 19:10.730
We were just talking
about Indiana.

19:10.799 --> 19:12.637
Save yourself the trouble.
This is just stupid.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.100
I don't know
what I was thinking.

19:14.168 --> 19:16.837
I'm not gonna drag you guys
anywhere you don't want to go.

19:18.172 --> 19:21.208
Actually, moving might not
be that big of a deal.

19:21.276 --> 19:24.177
The way I figure, I'll probably
be at UCLA most of the year.

19:24.244 --> 19:27.113
Yeah. I'm changing schools
anyway.

19:27.181 --> 19:29.783
Be a chance to meet
all new girls.

19:31.285 --> 19:32.552
What about you?

19:32.620 --> 19:33.854
Oh, I already have a girl.

19:36.957 --> 19:39.393
And if she's gotta move
to Indiana for a job,

19:39.461 --> 19:43.330
I'm willing to put on a
muumuu and curlers for her.

19:43.398 --> 19:45.599
So, does this mean you're
willing to discuss it now?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.234
Don't need to.

19:47.301 --> 19:48.969
We're going.

19:49.036 --> 19:50.237
Yeah.

19:52.374 --> 19:54.742
Brad, don't forget
my car's in the shop.

19:54.809 --> 19:57.310
So, I'm gonna take your car and
drop you guys off at school.

19:57.379 --> 20:00.848
Wait, what makes you think you can
just take my car just like that?

20:00.915 --> 20:04.451
Because I paid for half of it
"just like that."

20:05.987 --> 20:08.121
Oh, don't forget
your lunches, boys.

20:08.189 --> 20:13.259
Mom, we haven't taken our lunches
to school since the fifth grade.

20:13.327 --> 20:15.496
Well, I don't know
what I was thinking.

20:15.563 --> 20:17.368
I'm kind of distracted.
Have a great day at school.

20:17.398 --> 20:19.800
Hey... Wait for me outside.

20:21.703 --> 20:24.604
So, looks like
we're gonna do this.

20:25.372 --> 20:26.606
Move to Indiana.

20:26.674 --> 20:28.542
Yeah.

20:28.676 --> 20:30.744
You having
second thoughts at all?

20:30.811 --> 20:32.412
No. You?

20:33.648 --> 20:34.848
No. No.

20:37.485 --> 20:39.319
I guess I'll feel better,
you know,

20:39.387 --> 20:41.354
when I make this call
to Dr. Lee,

20:41.423 --> 20:43.857
tell him I've decided to come.

20:43.925 --> 20:46.894
Yeah. I think you will.

20:46.961 --> 20:50.798
So, have a great
<i>Tool Time</i> grand finale.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.205
It's gonna be really emotional.

20:54.235 --> 20:56.536
Yeah, I know. Do you
have enough Kleenex?

20:56.604 --> 20:59.039
If not, I'm sure
we have extra gauze.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.821
<i>One, two, three...
You're pinned!</i>

21:14.889 --> 21:16.023
You lose!

21:16.090 --> 21:19.159
No, I haven't.
Not the second round!

21:19.226 --> 21:20.326
No!

21:21.428 --> 21:24.064
Dad, it smells under here!

21:24.132 --> 21:25.565
Seriously!

21:25.633 --> 21:28.334
It's the Tim Taylor
half-smelly nelson.

21:29.603 --> 21:32.072
<i>Yeah, Dad!
Your pits are the pits!</i>

21:43.050 --> 21:45.485
What a day!

21:45.553 --> 21:48.121
Binford's
executive schlockmeister...

21:53.094 --> 21:55.662
Well, change is difficult
for most people,

21:55.729 --> 21:59.032
but on the other hand, if you
are going to leave <i>Tool Time...</i>

22:00.768 --> 22:04.037
