00:01.479 --> 00:02.915
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Welcome back, friends.

00:02.959 --> 00:05.962
You'll recall Jane was madly
in love with Rafael.

00:06.006 --> 00:09.792
But then Jane's husband Michael came back from the dead.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.273
Actually, I go by Jason now,
ma'am.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.752
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's right.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.972
Michael, I mean Jason,
has amnesia.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.148
And Jane wanted to help him
get his memories back.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.803
Unfortunately,
it wasn't working.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.632
And then this happened,
so Jane made a big decision.

00:23.675 --> 00:24.807
I'm getting a divorce.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.244
But Jason had other ideas.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.986
Old Bo over there got ahold of
the divorce papers.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.641
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know. Straight out of
a telenovela, right?

00:32.684 --> 00:35.600
And speaking of telenovelas,
Rogelio and River Fields

00:35.644 --> 00:37.950
finally put their
differences aside

00:37.994 --> 00:40.953
to star in the American remake
ofThe Passions of Santos.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.477
But then River dropped a bomb
on Xo.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.001
I know. Looks scary, right?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.003
So let's find out
what's going on.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.007
Ah, friends,
as I've made clear,

00:51.051 --> 00:54.967
Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was raised on a steady diet

00:55.011 --> 00:56.969
of telenovelas...

00:57.013 --> 00:59.276
Catholicism...

00:59.320 --> 01:03.498
and the sun shining only
on her.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.065
And all of these moments
imprinted

01:05.108 --> 01:07.241
to make her who she is today.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.677
You'll take Mateo to karate.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.026
Don't forget his water bottle

01:10.070 --> 01:11.941
or the shoes he took from Ethan.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.335
I'll meet Jason at Abuela's
and get the divorce papers.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.076
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That is... super bossy.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.165
I'm just praying
that Jason shows up

01:18.208 --> 01:19.688
with papers that aren't
dog-bitten.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.603
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Super faithful.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.344
That makes two of us.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.954
I love you.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.826
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And super romantic.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.264
RAFAEL: Hey.
Ready for karate, bud?

01:30.307 --> 01:33.310
Mwah. Mwah.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.966
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, most of the time.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.577
Sorry, I-I don't know
what that was.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.537
Go. Get your divorce.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.842
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, for the record,

01:43.886 --> 01:45.105
she was trying to do.

01:47.498 --> 01:50.153
Hi there. It's
a beautiful day

01:50.197 --> 01:53.156
and I was hoping you
might join me on a picnic.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.636
W-What are you doing?

01:54.679 --> 01:56.203
I'm coming a courtin'.

01:56.246 --> 01:59.728
See, I got to thinking about
this whole divorce thing,

01:59.771 --> 02:03.297
and, uh...  I'm
not so sure about it anymore.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.386
I want to take you on a date.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.691
Make sure the spark...

02:06.735 --> 02:08.954
...is really dead.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.927
No. There is no spark.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.234
So you're saying you
didn't feel anything

02:27.277 --> 02:30.411
at all when we danced?

02:30.454 --> 02:33.240
What? No! You need to go.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.372
Really?
Yes. Really.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.548
Y-- M-M-Mateo is in his room

02:37.592 --> 02:40.421
and he doesn't know you're alive
so you need to leave now.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.908
I am going to tell him
when I see him later.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.346
And then I want us to go
on a date; we need it.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.348
He actually kissed me
on my head this morning.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.871
Ay.XIOMARA:
I need your help.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.221
Mom, you didn't have
to come down.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.223
We could've brought
lunch up to you.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
No, no, no.
With this.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.705
River gave it to me.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.446
Rogelio's on his
way home from work

03:05.489 --> 03:07.274
and I have to
tell him about it.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.189
Tell him about what?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.975
No!

03:13.018 --> 03:15.195
No!

03:15.238 --> 03:17.197
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
If somebody doesn't tell me
what this thing is...

03:17.240 --> 03:20.200
River is getting paid
twice as much as Dad?

03:20.243 --> 03:21.288
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
No!

03:21.331 --> 03:22.811
How am I gonna tell him?

03:22.854 --> 03:24.291
We're here for you, Mom.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.683
If worse comes to worst,
we'll all just sit

03:25.727 --> 03:27.207
on him till he calms down.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.686
ROGELIO:
Hello,

03:28.730 --> 03:30.645
beautiful ladies of my life.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.212
You're in a good mood.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.735
It was another fantastic day

03:33.778 --> 03:36.172
â™ª To be Rogelio.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.175
River and I are
officially a dream team.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.872
Hashtag...

03:43.440 --> 03:45.050
Oh, wow.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.707
I love it. We approach acting
the same way.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.188
We plank together for two
minutes before each scene

03:52.232 --> 03:54.712
to make sure our abs are tight.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.933
Okay, let's eat.
Mom.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.195
Tell him.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.588
I have cancer;
can you do it?

04:00.631 --> 04:04.287
This is the last time
you use that excuse.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.985
Dad, River is making twice what
you're making on the show.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.424
But River thought you'd
take it better coming from me.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.164
Remember, Dad,
you're a great team.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.471
She's a wonderful scene partner.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.299
#Rivelio.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.432
Calm down, Rogelio.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.172
Things are going
great on set.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.522
Don't overreact.

04:21.565 --> 04:26.178
Oh, I wouldn't dream
of overreacting.

04:26.222 --> 04:29.312
Acting is reacting, after all.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.488
And since
I'm a professional actor,

04:31.532 --> 04:36.624
I will react in a perfectly
professional way.

04:36.667 --> 04:40.454
Believe me. You may not remember
that you were the president,

04:40.497 --> 04:42.412
but I do.

04:42.456 --> 04:46.721
Even if you have no memory
of why you wanted to save

04:46.764 --> 04:49.898
this great country of ours,
I remember.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.465
What the hell
are you doing?

04:51.508 --> 04:53.815
Oh, I'm acting
with my scene partner,

04:53.858 --> 04:56.644
my costar, my teammate.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.473
Well, could you stop it?
It's weird and distracting.

04:59.516 --> 05:03.955
Oh, okay. Is it twice as
distracting as this?

05:05.653 --> 05:09.309
Because if something on
our set was twice as much

05:09.352 --> 05:12.703
as something else on our set,
I'm sure you'd tell me, right?

05:12.747 --> 05:14.401
So, Xo told you.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.707
That you're a
backstabbing back stabber

05:16.751 --> 05:20.276
who stabs people in
the back? Yes, she did.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.278
Calm down.
This is beneath you.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.280
Oh, it's beneath me, huh?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.934
You know what
else is beneath me?

05:25.977 --> 05:28.284
Or rather, if I may be more
accurate, beneath you?

05:28.328 --> 05:32.070
My pitiful pittance
of a paycheck.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.768
Why don't we
all just take five?

05:33.811 --> 05:37.337
Oh, which means Ionly
get two and a half, right?

05:40.165 --> 05:42.603
You are really acting
like a child!

05:43.952 --> 05:45.606
Hey.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.564
How did the open house go?

05:47.608 --> 05:49.000
A lot of lookie-loos,
but no offers yet.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.438
Oh, maybe they were
there to look at you.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.570
So did you get
the divorce papers?

05:53.614 --> 05:56.094
No, but I did get
a picnic basket

05:56.138 --> 05:58.096
and roses and
asked out on a date.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.621
What?Jason says he wants to

06:00.664 --> 06:03.058
"make sure the spark
is really dead."

06:03.101 --> 06:05.408
You know, I'm
beginning to not like that guy.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.497
I said no, obviously,
and the next time I see him

06:07.541 --> 06:09.107
I have a whole calm,
cool, collected speech

06:09.151 --> 06:10.587
I'm gonna give to him
about boundaries.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.284
What was he thinking?I don't know.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.722
But what I did realize was

06:14.765 --> 06:17.638
what I really want to do
is go on a date with you.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.684
Yeah?
Yeah.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.425
I'm liking the sound
of that.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.734
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And I'm not liking
the sound of that.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.431
Mommy! Michael came back
from the dead!

06:35.743 --> 06:38.398
Just take a nice
deep breath, okay?

06:38.441 --> 06:40.487
I don't understand. How do dead
people come back to life?

06:40.530 --> 06:42.663
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Good luck explaining this one.

06:42.706 --> 06:45.361
You see, Mateo, Michael wasn't
actually dead, he just...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.450
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Got taken by a sociopath.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.538
...had an accident.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.671
And he lost his memory.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.934
How?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
She fried his brain.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.719
He fell and he
bumped his head.
Mm-hmm.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.547
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, they're good.

06:57.591 --> 07:01.246
And now he has amnesia and
he can't remember who he is.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.684
Like in Papa's telenovela?Crazily enough,

07:03.727 --> 07:05.381
exactly like that.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.557
Michael even forgot his name,
so he's called Jason now.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.125
Will you ever lose your memory
and forget about me?

07:10.168 --> 07:11.866
Oh.
RAFAEL:
No.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.868
This is a crazy
rare kind of accident

07:13.911 --> 07:14.956
that almost
never happens.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.088
Are you married
to Michael again?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.220
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, kid.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.700
Talk about salt in the wound.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.963
Legally, but not really.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.617
What about me and Daddy?

07:23.660 --> 07:25.140
Oh. Oh. Oh.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.055
Oh, nothing is changing.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.622
Shh, it's okay.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.275
I'm gonna call Petra,

07:30.319 --> 07:31.973
cancel our dinner
for tonight.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.148
ROGELIO:
Dinner for two.

07:33.191 --> 07:34.497
XIOMARA:
Can't eat.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.238
I'm already nauseous.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.239
How was your day?

07:37.282 --> 07:39.154
Oh, fine, fine.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.634
Great.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.332
Come on...
tell me the truth.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.594
How did it go with River?

07:46.553 --> 07:48.598
I don't know how I'm going
to work with that woman

07:48.642 --> 07:50.992
for the next seven
to ten years.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.516
Look, I know this is hard,
and while I agree

07:53.560 --> 07:55.300
that you should be getting
the same pay as River,

07:55.344 --> 07:57.477
you have to admit
it's pretty cool

07:57.520 --> 07:59.914
that a woman is winning in
the fight for gender parity.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.742
Fight for what now?

08:01.785 --> 08:04.005
It's the idea that men and
women should be paid the same

08:04.048 --> 08:06.007
for doing the same job.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.400
It's a big issue
in Hollywood right now.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.794
A-And most people are pro?

08:11.795 --> 08:13.536
Just checking.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.669
A lot of celebrities are
standing up for each other

08:15.712 --> 08:18.106
and demanding equal
pay for women.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.674
William H. Macy stood
up for Emmy Rossum.

08:20.717 --> 08:23.241
Bradley Cooper supported
Jennifer Lawrence.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.592
When did you become
such a name-dropper?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.115
It's quite a turn-on.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.031
Well, you know,
chemo gives me

08:30.074 --> 08:33.687
lots of downtime
to read these.

08:33.730 --> 08:37.212
Well, I thank you
for alerting me

08:37.255 --> 08:39.867
to this appalling issue.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.564
Clearly, I need to read more

08:41.608 --> 08:44.872
about this important initiative.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.875
Put the books away, girls;
it's time for brunch.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.791
Oh.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.322
What's up?

09:00.365 --> 09:02.542
Nothing. Jason stuff.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.587
ANNA and ELLIE:
Mateo!

09:04.631 --> 09:06.763
He just poured salt
on our pancakes.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.722
Mateo, that kind
of behavior is unacceptable.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.724
Can you just give
him a break today?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.248
You know, he's got a lot going
on with Jason and everything.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.771
That's not
why I did it.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.469
I did it because they
left me out yesterday.

09:17.513 --> 09:20.777
ELLIE: We only left him out
because he was hitting Anna.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.039
See? Like that.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.086
Do not touch my body!

09:25.129 --> 09:26.304
Good girl, Anna.Mateo, you stop that.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.655
Hey!

09:28.698 --> 09:30.004
What? Taught them how
to protect themselves.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.571
Instead of coddling them.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.050
You know what? Why don't you
discipline your kids

09:33.094 --> 09:34.225
and I'll discipline mine?

09:34.269 --> 09:35.836
Works for me.
Good luck with that.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.664
So, basically, be glad
you had an open house

09:37.707 --> 09:39.970
and missed brunch.
Any offers?

09:40.014 --> 09:43.452
No. Which means we should
go cheap for our date.No problem.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.585
I'm gonna grab a few more shifts
at the Marbella, too.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.239
No. The whole point

09:48.283 --> 09:50.633
of this real estate job
was so you could write.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.551
I can't write.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.335
Not with all this Jason stuff.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.815
Did he text you again?

10:00.904 --> 10:02.645
What is wrong with that guy?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.125
I don't know.Tell him that it's done.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.996
Okay? Tell him that you're
not helping him anymore.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.302
Yeah. You're right.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.829
RIVER:
That is not happening.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.658
I am not fighting for
gender parity for you.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.399
That's ridiculous.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.836
But it's what all the A-listers
are doing these days.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.665
Gender parity is
for women, Rogelio.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.928
Because women should
be paid the same.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.626
Just like I should get paid
the same.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.758
This is not about you.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.673
You're right, this is
so much bigger than me.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.937
It's a fight for fairness
and equality.
No.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.680
This is about the fact

10:37.724 --> 10:39.987
that I am the bigger
name in the U.S.

10:40.030 --> 10:43.207
I am why they
green-lit the pilot.

10:43.251 --> 10:45.775
I have worked my ass
off to get where I am,

10:45.819 --> 10:47.777
and I'm proud that
I'm the rare actress

10:47.821 --> 10:49.997
in this incredibly
sexist industry

10:50.040 --> 10:52.913
who's actually getting
paid what I deserve.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.872
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sorry, Rogelio. I'm with her.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.135
Then I will have
to stand up for myself.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.876
So watch out.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.922
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of an epic feud...

11:01.965 --> 11:03.358
They called
you, too?

11:03.401 --> 11:05.229
Mm-hmm.

11:05.273 --> 11:08.580
I hate you guys!We're girls, and
we're not fond of you, either.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.234
I'm sorry,
Ms. Solano,

11:10.278 --> 11:11.845
but we don't have
enough staff to handle

11:11.888 --> 11:13.411
these three
causing chaos all day.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.500
They've done a lot of damage.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.067
Oh, please.
How much damage

11:17.111 --> 11:18.852
can three small children
possibly...?

11:18.895 --> 11:21.593
Wow. Okay.
No, you're excused.

11:21.637 --> 11:25.380
Girls, this is
unacceptable.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.381
It's all
Mateo's fault.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.730
No, it's not!

11:27.774 --> 11:30.037
They tied my shoelaces
together and ran away.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.560
Only 'cause
he hit me!

11:31.603 --> 11:34.389
Did not! I only
grabbed her dress.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.608
You need to learn to use
your words, not your hands.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.045
Apologize!

11:39.916 --> 11:42.571
I'm gonna kill you!
No. Oh.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.226
Hey. LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. I'm starting to wonder

11:45.269 --> 11:47.097
if I even want kids.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.452
It's just a big mess.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.932
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
The Kids' Club? I'll say.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.761
They just cannot
get along.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.068
Hey, what's with
all the texts?

12:01.111 --> 12:03.113
River gave my number
out to the crew.

12:03.157 --> 12:06.029
I'm now officially the "Rogelio
Whisperer," so I've been getting

12:06.073 --> 12:08.510
a lot of feedback.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.207
Find any good articles?

12:10.251 --> 12:12.862
Yes. The "Three-Step"
talking technique.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.559
I'm gonna e-mail Petra.

12:14.603 --> 12:17.040
Oh, she's
online. Kismet.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.314
I...

12:36.146 --> 12:39.541
Temp! Get me an article on how
to make siblings get along!

12:39.584 --> 12:42.022
And make sure it's from
a prominent pediatrician.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.551
Geez. Petra has been
so snippy lately.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.772
Hmm.

13:32.289 --> 13:35.727
Temp! Up your game!
Something Jane can't debunk!

13:35.771 --> 13:37.686
Ooh, I think I found the one.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.558
"The family sits in a neutral
space and shares their feelings

13:40.602 --> 13:42.734
without criticism or rejection
so everyone feels heard."

13:42.778 --> 13:44.606
That's sounds great, hun.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.869
I got to call your dad,
talk him down.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.566
Mm-hmm.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.927
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Huh. Look at that.

14:07.194 --> 14:11.154
This is myset, and I can behave
however I want to behave!

14:11.198 --> 14:13.200
You can,
but what good is it doing

14:13.243 --> 14:15.115
besides making
the whole crew miserable?

14:15.158 --> 14:16.986
I'm not stupid, Xiomara.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.815
I know everyone calls you
the "Rogelio Whisperer,"

14:19.859 --> 14:21.686
but whisper to someone else,

14:21.730 --> 14:23.340
because I don't need
to be handled.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.342
I just need to express my anger!

14:27.170 --> 14:29.738
Hey! I don't need
to stand on an apple box,

14:29.781 --> 14:33.002
because I don't need to be the
same height as River in heels

14:33.046 --> 14:34.874
since we don't have
to be equals,

14:34.917 --> 14:38.965
because, apparently, equality
no longer matters in America!

14:39.008 --> 14:40.967
Didn't you hear me?

14:41.010 --> 14:43.230
Get rid of this useless thing!

14:45.885 --> 14:47.843
Oh!

14:47.887 --> 14:50.063
Medic!

14:50.106 --> 14:52.065
JANE:
No kicking... and no punching.

14:52.108 --> 14:55.329
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait a second. Where are they?

14:55.372 --> 14:58.941
Oh, I see. The tent must be
their neutral space.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.552
Now, you can only talk if
you're holding the stick.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.076
This way,

15:03.119 --> 15:04.773
everyone can voice
their opinions.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.862
You're not holding the
talking stick, Mommy.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.342
Good point.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.692
And that reminds me.
No one can interrupt anyone

15:10.735 --> 15:12.694
when they're speaking
in the tent.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.522
And... no grabbing.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.524
Oh, I wasn't grabbing.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.265
I was passing
it to Mateo.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.397
Now, Mateo, tell us,

15:20.441 --> 15:24.271
what do the girls do that
make you so very angry?

15:24.314 --> 15:26.490
I don't like it
when they leave me out.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.275
They're doing it now!

15:28.318 --> 15:29.841
They're not
even listening!

15:29.885 --> 15:32.453
You listen with your ears,
not your eyes, dummy.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.977
Ellie, that's rude.Don't call me dummy!

15:35.021 --> 15:36.761
Oh. Hey.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.198
Stop it, you dummy!

15:38.241 --> 15:40.113
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aah! OMG! Take cover!

15:40.156 --> 15:41.984
Everyone out! Go!

15:42.028 --> 15:43.507
PETRA:
You heard her! Move!

15:43.551 --> 15:45.118
Now everyone go stand
in a different corner

15:45.161 --> 15:46.946
of the room! Go!No fair!

15:46.989 --> 15:48.773
See, I'm always
by myself!

15:48.817 --> 15:50.950
Anna, Ellie, I said
everyone in their own corner.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.300
No, it's okay, girls.
You can stay together.

15:53.343 --> 15:56.216
Petra, may I see you
on the balcony for a moment?

15:59.349 --> 16:01.830
Smile. We don't want
to argue in front of the kids.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.398
Mateo has a point.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.877
It's always two against one.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.401
Maybe Mateo needs to
get a thicker skin.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.055
Why are you being so harsh? Huh?

16:09.098 --> 16:11.187
He's a kid,
and he's feeling left out.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.059
Yeah, well, sometimes
people feel left out, Jane.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.626
That's life. You don't think
I ever feel left out?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.066
Forget it. My kids
are smart enough

16:20.109 --> 16:21.589
to know we're
fighting out here.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.634
Let's just drop it.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.553
So, I know you saw Auntie
Petra and Mommy fighting.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.251
You guys were fighting?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.253
No. Yeah. No.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.951
I-I thought maybe you thought
that, but I'm glad you didn't,

16:35.995 --> 16:39.302
because you're right, we
weren't, so, good job.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.002
Aah!

16:43.045 --> 16:45.743
So, I-I need you
to apologize to Pammy

16:45.787 --> 16:49.269
for the mess you made at
the Kids' Club yesterday, okay?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.839
Oh, you change your mind?

16:54.883 --> 16:56.841
Ready to go on a date?

16:56.885 --> 16:59.148
Not a date, but I will
have coffee with you

16:59.192 --> 17:01.107
in exchange for the
signed divorce papers.Ah.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.978
A negotiator.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.501
I like that.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.329
Just like buying a steed.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.940
It's not a negotia...Coffee's not a date.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.855
It's more of a hangover cure,

17:10.899 --> 17:12.379
but maybe we can grab that

17:12.422 --> 17:13.815
the next morning.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.774
What's your counteroffer?It depends.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.560
What kind of rod do you like?

17:21.127 --> 17:23.607
Fishing. Now that's a date.

17:23.651 --> 17:26.219
Fishing actually sounds like
the opposite of a date to me.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.526
Oh, couple hours on the water,
wind in our hair...

17:29.570 --> 17:31.659
Now are you a worm
or a chum girl?

17:31.702 --> 17:33.835
Neither, and I don't
want to go fishing.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.707
Why? You scared that
if we spend more time together,

17:36.751 --> 17:39.101
you'll catch more than fish?

17:39.145 --> 17:41.756
You'll catch feelings for me?

17:41.799 --> 17:45.325
I am not afraid
of that at all.Then let's go.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.458
It's easy. Go fishing, and get
the signed divorce papers.

17:48.502 --> 17:51.026
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Guess he's using
the divorce papers as bait.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.419
Fine. Deal.

17:52.462 --> 17:55.291
Ifyou still want them
after our date.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.032
ROGELIO:
What do you mean, "if"?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.642
Ifwe finish the pilot?

17:58.686 --> 18:01.123
We haveto finish the pilot!Look, River was

18:01.167 --> 18:02.951
just released
from the hospital.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.475
Half her face is paralyzed,
and we won't know

18:05.519 --> 18:07.042
how much permanent damage
you did

18:07.086 --> 18:09.131
until she gets
some feeling back.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.351
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: For those of you keeping score,

18:11.394 --> 18:14.049
this is the third time
that Rogelio de la Vega

18:14.093 --> 18:15.877
has sent River Fields
to the hospital.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.796
If her recovery's too long,

18:21.839 --> 18:23.276
we may just have
to cancel production.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.147
RIVER:
There will be no delay

18:25.191 --> 18:27.367
and no cancelling
of anything!

18:27.410 --> 18:29.543
The show must go on!

18:29.586 --> 18:31.371
I will act...

18:31.414 --> 18:33.199
with half of my face.

18:35.244 --> 18:38.204
You can just shoot
me exclusively on my

18:38.247 --> 18:40.031
unparalyzed side.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.512
Now, let's get to work!

18:49.911 --> 18:51.304
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Certain performances are etched

18:51.347 --> 18:52.914
in dramatic history.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.307
None more so than River Fields

18:54.350 --> 18:55.917
acting with half her face

18:55.960 --> 18:57.745
inThe Passions
of Steve and Brenda.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.877
You could get a full lobotomy,

18:59.921 --> 19:02.228
have every organ
in your body removed,

19:02.271 --> 19:06.057
every feature
on your face replaced,

19:06.101 --> 19:09.496
but our souls would still
recognize each other.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.719
I still love you,
Mr. President.

19:15.763 --> 19:19.419
I will never,
ever not love you.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.078
Cut!

19:27.122 --> 19:28.471
Oh.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.994
Oh!

19:33.215 --> 19:36.740
CREW :
River! River! River! River!

19:36.784 --> 19:39.395
ROGELIO:
She was incredible.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.964
She deserves every dollar
they're paying her.

19:44.835 --> 19:47.098
Then why do you look upset?

19:47.142 --> 19:50.276
I'm fine.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.669
Tell me.Why?

19:52.713 --> 19:54.758
Did the crew ask
you to handle me?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.282
No.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.675
I'm asking as your wife.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.941
It's just... yes,

20:03.985 --> 20:06.422
River clearly deserves

20:06.466 --> 20:08.772
to get paid what
she's getting,

20:08.816 --> 20:10.774
but so do I.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.690
This is myproject.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.867
I fought four years
to get it made.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.435
It's my telenovela,
my culture,

20:19.479 --> 20:22.786
my story I'm bringing
to the screen.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.441
Yet somehow,
with all of that,

20:25.485 --> 20:28.009
I'm only worth half
as much as her.

20:29.184 --> 20:31.142
It's not right.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.971
You're right. It's not.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.147
I did some research,

20:36.191 --> 20:39.629
and pay parity affects
people of color, too.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.675
So this...

20:41.718 --> 20:45.505
plus, with everything that's
going on in this country...

20:48.290 --> 20:52.686
It's always been my dream
to be famous in America,

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
but I'm starting
to wonder.

20:54.340 --> 20:58.648
Why am I so desperate
for validation

20:58.692 --> 21:04.088
from a country that doesn't
seem to value or accept me?

21:10.573 --> 21:13.794
I have planned
the perfect date for tonight.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.186
Oh, I...And it's cheap.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.319
Don't worry.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.452
I have the lockbox code

21:19.495 --> 21:21.062
to a luxury estate

21:21.105 --> 21:22.933
we're showing on the marina.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.153
We can sit on the veranda.

21:25.196 --> 21:28.417
Have a glass of wine.
There's a pool.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.158
You can bring your swimsuit...

21:30.201 --> 21:32.378
or not.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.597
We should cancel.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.946
What do you mean?

21:35.990 --> 21:38.035
Y-You need to spend time

21:38.079 --> 21:40.255
with Petra and the
girls, instead.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.778
You've been so focused
on Mateo and Jason,

21:41.822 --> 21:43.824
I think they're feeling
a little neglected.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.608
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sounds
like Mateo isn't the only one

21:45.652 --> 21:47.784
who needs coddling. Yeah.

21:47.828 --> 21:50.744
I have been...
preoccupied.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.267
You're right.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.312
Rain check?

21:53.355 --> 21:54.617
There's something else.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.402
My offer of a
coffee date to Jason

21:56.445 --> 21:58.969
sort of turned into fishing.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.928
What?I obviously don't want to go,

22:00.971 --> 22:02.843
but it's one afternoon,
and after,

22:02.886 --> 22:05.672
he'll sign the divorce papers,
and we'll all move on.

22:05.715 --> 22:10.154
I'm gonna go to the hotel
and see the girls.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.204
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us...

22:16.247 --> 22:18.685
Uh-oh.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.383
Now, Rafael, remember:
calm, cool and collected.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.559
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.692
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.259
Dude, she's my wife.

22:28.303 --> 22:29.739
She is notyour wife.

22:29.783 --> 22:33.221
Legally, she is.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.441
She's with me.
I got that.

22:35.484 --> 22:38.400
But I've been learning a
little bit about my history,

22:38.444 --> 22:41.969
and the way I see it,
Jane was with me,

22:42.012 --> 22:44.406
and you tried to
steal her away,

22:44.450 --> 22:46.930
but she still chose me.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.932
We got married,

22:48.976 --> 22:52.936
then I died, and you
moved in on her.

22:52.980 --> 22:56.940
So yeah, I'm taking
my wife out on a date.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.899
It should be noted,
in this moment,

22:58.942 --> 23:01.945
Rafael understood exactly
how Mateo and the twins felt.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.865
Ow! Owie! Ow! Ow! Ow!

23:08.909 --> 23:12.608
But, of course, Rafael
was an adult. So instead...

23:28.668 --> 23:31.453
Isn't this a gorgeous day?

23:31.497 --> 23:35.109
Sure is. Maybe we can
just sit here on the dock

23:35.152 --> 23:37.024
and enjoy it from dry
land for 20 minutes,

23:37.067 --> 23:39.200
then go home.
No way.

23:39.243 --> 23:42.203
We're gonna go out on the water,
and we're gonna have some fun.

23:42.246 --> 23:45.815
You know what?
I forgot to go over the rules.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.122
Rule number one: you can't have

23:48.165 --> 23:50.167
that look on your face.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.821
Or that one.

23:53.388 --> 23:54.955
Number two?

23:54.998 --> 23:57.174
Not allowed to mention Michael.

23:57.218 --> 23:58.393
And number three:

23:58.437 --> 24:00.221
this date's not over

24:00.264 --> 24:02.615
till you catch a fish.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.530
Hmm.

24:09.186 --> 24:12.668
Uh-oh. Looks like
someone's violating

24:12.712 --> 24:14.627
rule number one.

24:16.672 --> 24:20.023
What kind of stuff do you like
to do in your spare time?

24:20.067 --> 24:23.331
I love to read.
For fun?

24:23.374 --> 24:25.333
What else?

24:25.376 --> 24:27.204
I like talking. A lot.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.206
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Nothing wrong with that.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.645
As you know, I'm a huge talker.
Usually about my feelings.

24:32.688 --> 24:36.692
Really like to get in there,
examine things from all sides.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.041
That's okay.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.217
Everyone's got their thing.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.655
Mine's hunting.Hate all guns.

24:42.698 --> 24:45.222
Don't like being around them.

24:45.266 --> 24:48.269
Okeydoke. Got it, no hunting.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.533
Horseback riding?

24:51.577 --> 24:54.101
Did it once. Not a fan.

24:56.103 --> 24:59.410
But camping, right?

24:59.454 --> 25:02.196
I watched those camping videos.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.720
Looks like someone's
on a fishing expedition.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.810
Actually, I used to hate
camping, but...

25:09.116 --> 25:11.727
But what?

25:11.771 --> 25:14.948
Permission to break
rule number two?

25:14.991 --> 25:16.515
Michael made me go
a couple times,

25:16.558 --> 25:19.953
and, you know,
I still don't exactly like it,

25:19.996 --> 25:22.433
but I liked camping
with Michael.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.131
Oh!
Oh!

25:24.174 --> 25:26.829
Oh! Yeah!You got something. Yeah,
reel it in, reel it in.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.353
Wow, looks like a big one!

25:29.397 --> 25:31.399
Oh.

25:39.146 --> 25:42.105
You were right. This
spot is better luck.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.933
For me, at least.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.545
I know why you don't
want me to teach you.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.939
You want to stay out here
on the water with me

25:49.983 --> 25:51.941
as long as possible.Okay.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.508
Fine, teach me how to fish.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.121
Now, like I said,

25:58.165 --> 26:02.822
you want to move it back and
forth just the slightest bit.

26:02.865 --> 26:07.609
And if you feel a bite,
don't jerk.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.873
Now, point the rod wherever
you want it to land,

26:10.917 --> 26:15.182
then slowly bring it back and
make a short, sharp movement,

26:15.225 --> 26:17.663
letting the rod tip do
all the work for you.

26:19.534 --> 26:23.407
Um, who knew fishing
could sound so erotic?

26:23.451 --> 26:25.584
I feel something.Hmm?

26:25.627 --> 26:26.802
On the line. I feel something!

26:26.846 --> 26:29.196
No, don't stand.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.461
Jane! Jane, stand up.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.245
It's, like, four feet of water.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.250
I caught a fish.

26:40.294 --> 26:44.472
Now will you please
sign the divorce papers?

26:45.516 --> 26:48.171
Yeah. Okay.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.826
Looks like Jane
is finally off the hook.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.443
You're late.

26:59.487 --> 27:00.923
And you smell fishy.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.838
Sorry. Didn't have
time to shower.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.187
All right, kids.

27:04.231 --> 27:07.451
Everyone over here.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.062
Pictures of the three
of you getting along

27:09.105 --> 27:10.759
so you can remember

27:10.803 --> 27:12.543
your happy memories together.
You're making a photo album.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.633
Aw, I don't want to.

27:14.676 --> 27:15.982
Me, neither.PETRA:
Glue the pictures

27:16.025 --> 27:17.853
or no iPad for a year.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.643
So, how was last night
with Rafael?

27:24.686 --> 27:26.645
Fine.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.430
Why are you staring at me?

27:29.473 --> 27:31.519
I'm not.Do you want a medal
because my children

27:31.562 --> 27:32.781
got to spend time
with their own father?

27:32.825 --> 27:36.306
Geez, what is your problem?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.134
Why are you trying
to pick a fight with me?

27:38.178 --> 27:40.615
If you're fighting,
you should get in the tent.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.051
Yeah!Get in the tent.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.575
CHILDREN :
Get in the tent!
Get in the tent!

27:46.708 --> 27:50.494
All right, well, we're in here.
So, what's really going on?

27:50.538 --> 27:53.976
Currently? I'm trapped in a
tent with your fish stench.

27:54.020 --> 27:57.327
Come on. I understand
that you felt neglected

27:57.371 --> 27:58.981
because of
the whole Jason business,

27:59.025 --> 28:00.156
but Rafael didn't mean
to leave you out.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.028
He's not the one
leaving me out. You are.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.117
What?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.293
Never mind.Oh, wait, wait.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.860
Come...Do not touch my body!

28:07.903 --> 28:10.210
Fine. But this is
supposed to be a neutral space

28:10.253 --> 28:13.953
for talking things out,
so share your feelings.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.833
I'm just...

28:24.877 --> 28:27.314
a little hurt.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.492
Well, this huge thing
happened with Jason.

28:31.535 --> 28:34.277
And you talked to Raf. You
talked to your grandmother.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.410
Mateo, even. Everyone but me.

28:36.453 --> 28:40.806
It's like I'm the last
person on your totem pole.

28:42.851 --> 28:45.941
I'm sorry.
I just didn't think...

28:45.985 --> 28:48.074
That's the point.Come on.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.511
You know I love you.Yeah.

28:51.555 --> 28:54.254
But do you like me?

28:54.297 --> 28:56.517
Well, yeah. Mostly.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.388
I-I mean,

28:58.432 --> 28:59.694
do you like me?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.956
Sometimes.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.349
"Sometimes"? I said "mostly."

29:02.392 --> 29:04.003
They're synonymous.No, they are not.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.918
"Mostly" is definitely more
than "sometimes."

29:08.268 --> 29:10.574
Here's how I feel.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.969
I didn't grow up with a sister.

29:14.013 --> 29:17.364
But I feel like I have one now.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.285
Me, too.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.289
Yeah.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.604
Okay, so, do you really want
to hear about Jason?

29:40.648 --> 29:42.998
'Cause, honestly, it would
be great to talk to somebody

29:43.042 --> 29:44.260
that's not my boyfriend
or my grandmother.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.045
Yes, definitely.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.611
Preferably someplace bigger.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.135
Mm-hmm.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.844
Okay, go. Start
at the beginning.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.934
Okay. The last three weeks,

30:05.978 --> 30:10.112
um, my life has actually been
my dad's telenovela.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.027
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.159
Rogelio?

30:15.465 --> 30:18.294
I had a change of heart.

30:18.338 --> 30:22.037
I'm with you 100% in your
fight for pay equity.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.605
I don't understand.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.129
Well, Xiomara came
to talk to me.

30:27.173 --> 30:30.872
Now I understand what
you're fighting for.

30:30.916 --> 30:35.094
There are times when one
simply must take a stand.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.531
And this is one of them.

30:38.532 --> 30:41.840
Thank you, River.

30:41.883 --> 30:46.235
You may only have half a face,
but you have double the heart

30:46.279 --> 30:49.891
of anyone I have ever met.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.937
Aw.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.334
Wow. A total telenovela.Right?

30:58.378 --> 31:00.336
Okay, so, when he had
his arms around you,

31:00.380 --> 31:02.686
did you feel anything?

31:04.688 --> 31:06.734
You know, honestly...

31:09.737 --> 31:13.045
...I was scared that I would.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.699
That those feelings
for Michael would come back.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.701
I mean, how could they not?

31:17.745 --> 31:19.747
We were soul mates.

31:23.229 --> 31:26.928
But they didn't.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.757
I felt like I was
touching a stranger.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.586
'Cause Jason isa stranger.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.936
Are you saying
that there's no soul?

31:34.980 --> 31:37.721
That-that-that God
has nothing to do with it?

31:37.765 --> 31:40.202
That we're just
a collection of memories

31:40.246 --> 31:42.204
and experiences?Okay, look, this religious
stuff sounds like

31:42.248 --> 31:43.727
something you candiscuss
with your grandmother.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.033
But...

31:45.077 --> 31:47.383
practically speaking...

31:47.427 --> 31:50.386
you didn't feel anything.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.258
So let him go.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.043
Oh, but don't I owe it to him
to keep helping him

31:55.087 --> 31:56.566
with his memory?No.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.742
You owe it to yourself
to protect yourself...

31:58.786 --> 32:00.266
and your family.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.963
Look, do you
want my advice?

32:02.007 --> 32:04.139
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, after Rafael, Xo,

32:04.183 --> 32:06.272
Alba, Rogelio, Mateo-- sure!

32:06.315 --> 32:07.838
Tell Jason to leave.

32:07.882 --> 32:10.798
He has a life
in Montana.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.843
You have yours here.

32:12.887 --> 32:15.194
What you have with Raf is good.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.804
Don't risk it.

32:19.285 --> 32:21.504
'Cause once it's gone...

32:25.682 --> 32:27.858
No change with J.R.?

32:27.902 --> 32:30.774
She told me not to contact her,
so I haven't.

32:30.818 --> 32:33.734
But I really want to,

32:33.777 --> 32:36.563
because I miss her every day.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.871
You can accidentally
butt-dial her.

32:40.915 --> 32:44.005
You just, like,
let the phone ring

32:44.049 --> 32:45.398
a few times
and hang up.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.400
She texts you back,
you're in.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.184
If she doesn't...

32:49.228 --> 32:51.230
leave her alone.

32:53.232 --> 32:54.363
Okay.

32:56.322 --> 32:57.976
I'm gonna do it.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.716
Oh, Petra,

32:59.760 --> 33:01.892
you don't actually have
to use your butt. It's...

33:01.936 --> 33:04.808
No, I was only joking.:
Yeah.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.158
Yeah.

33:07.550 --> 33:10.031
Okay, let's get
out of here.
Mm.

33:11.206 --> 33:14.122
You know what you have to do?

33:14.166 --> 33:16.951
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.779
Do you want to come in?

33:18.822 --> 33:20.041
No, thanks.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.305
This is really
hard to say.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.048
You offered to
leave before,

33:27.092 --> 33:29.659
because you were
disrupting my life.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.314
I need to take you
up on that now.

33:32.358 --> 33:33.707
O-Or don't leave.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.665
I mean, you can
stay, of course.

33:35.709 --> 33:36.971
It's your life.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.147
But I have to get
back to mine,

33:39.191 --> 33:41.541
and spending time
with you-- any time--

33:41.584 --> 33:43.325
is threatening that.

33:43.369 --> 33:46.154
And I can't do it anymore.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.727
I am so sorry. I know
it sounds selfish,

33:53.770 --> 33:55.685
but putting distance between us,
it feels like the only way

33:55.729 --> 33:59.211
that I can get back
to a normal life...Hey. I get it.

33:59.254 --> 34:01.213
We're on the same page.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.693
Which is why
I already bought

34:03.737 --> 34:06.566
a bus ticket back to Montana.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.350
Oh.Yeah.

34:08.394 --> 34:10.526
I'm sorry I pushed so hard.

34:10.570 --> 34:13.051
It was just...

34:13.094 --> 34:15.488
here was this great girl,

34:15.531 --> 34:18.795
who was my wife, and...

34:18.839 --> 34:22.103
I'm watching all these videos,
and we're so in love.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.670
You know?

34:23.713 --> 34:25.454
And for so long,

34:25.498 --> 34:27.717
I've been out at sea...

34:27.761 --> 34:29.458
by myself.

34:30.764 --> 34:33.245
It felt like a way back
to something.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.421
That makes sense.

34:35.464 --> 34:38.250
But that something,
it isn't you.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.642
I mean...

34:39.686 --> 34:42.167
if I had to talk
that much every day...

34:42.210 --> 34:43.516
I'd go insane.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.519
I hear you.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.564
And planning
that date

34:48.608 --> 34:50.044
was so exhausting.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.480
I mean, can you imagine us

34:51.524 --> 34:53.482
trying to enjoy
a Sunday together?

34:53.526 --> 34:55.049
I'm like, "Let's get a beer

34:55.093 --> 34:57.747
and see where the day takes us,"
and you're like,

34:57.791 --> 34:59.140
"Let's make
a minute-by-minute plan

34:59.184 --> 35:02.535
and stick to it all day long."

35:02.578 --> 35:04.624
Ha!
And talk about
bullheaded,

35:04.667 --> 35:07.583
I mean, I-I've known
wild horses that are
easier to break.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.933
All right, already, I get it.

35:09.977 --> 35:12.066
We're really different.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.590
We really are.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.157
So, Jason's going
to come by

35:16.201 --> 35:17.550
with the divorce papers
tomorrow,

35:17.593 --> 35:19.334
and then he's going
back to Montana,

35:19.378 --> 35:21.336
and we can go back
to our lives.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.164
Good.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.905
Agreed.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.254
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And they all lived

35:26.298 --> 35:27.429
happily ever after.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.083
Not so fast.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.084
Where are you going?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.738
Sleep in your bed again.Nope.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.044
You're a big boy-- you
sleep in your own bed.But...

35:34.088 --> 35:35.829
End of story.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.442
Look at you,
laying down the law.

35:40.486 --> 35:43.097
Well, Petra was right--
I do coddle Mateo too much.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.144
And now can we finally have
some grown-up time?

35:46.187 --> 35:48.407
Mm, I would love
some grown-up time.Ooh.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.017
Yeah.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.846
Oh.Mm.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.808
Wow.

35:58.852 --> 36:01.637
You are welcome to
coddle meanytime.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.424
Mmm.

36:11.343 --> 36:14.172
Oh, J.R. texted Petra back.

36:14.215 --> 36:17.044
Mm. I'm glad you two
worked things out.

36:17.087 --> 36:20.526
Yeah. I realized she's
kind of like my sister.

36:24.138 --> 36:27.010
Which made me think
about the way I grew up,

36:27.054 --> 36:30.188
as an only child, and...
what that felt like.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.538
And...

36:32.581 --> 36:35.976
would you ever consider
having more kids?

36:37.064 --> 36:39.414
I do have three.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.591
And you know I can't have more.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.463
We can adopt.

36:46.247 --> 36:49.555
In the future. Would you
be open to talking about that?

36:52.819 --> 36:54.386
Yeah.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.910
I'd be open
to talking about that.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.349
Oh, I like this.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.221
Thinking about our future.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.571
We haven't done that in a while.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.703
I like it, too.

37:10.184 --> 37:11.359
Mmm.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.797
Aw. Looks like they got

37:14.841 --> 37:18.018
their romantic date after all.

37:18.061 --> 37:21.151
Bagel. Plain
and odorless.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.197
And they got theirs.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.720
And...

37:24.764 --> 37:26.896
I want to thank you
for going to River.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.550
She talked to the network,

37:28.594 --> 37:31.553
demanded equal pay,
and we got it.

37:31.597 --> 37:33.599
That's amazing.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.297
And it's also the last time

37:36.341 --> 37:37.820
I get involved in your work.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.562
Because it made you
not want to confide in me.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.782
And that's not okay.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.480
I don't want you
to ever doubt that I'm...

37:45.524 --> 37:47.134
on yourteam.

37:47.177 --> 37:49.441
Your real-life co-president.

37:49.484 --> 37:52.139
I love you, Xiomara.

38:03.324 --> 38:04.934
What? What is it?

38:04.978 --> 38:07.285
Friends, you'll want
to see this, too.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.033
Oh, she's good.

38:31.004 --> 38:34.312
No more...
soul mate stuff for me.

38:35.356 --> 38:36.618
I just realized...

38:36.662 --> 38:39.795
Jason isn't Michael,

38:39.839 --> 38:41.493
and we aren't connected anymore,

38:41.536 --> 38:43.495
and the essential thing

38:43.538 --> 38:46.019
that wasMichael...

38:46.062 --> 38:48.151
what I thought was the soul...

38:48.195 --> 38:50.328
it's not there anymore.

38:53.505 --> 38:54.810
What?

39:22.360 --> 39:25.058
Uh, the divorce papers.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.451
Signed.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.453
No funny business.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.890
I'm heading back to
Montana tomorrow morning.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.282
So...

39:33.980 --> 39:35.982
I also brought you
a parting gift.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.157
Oh.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.767
Wow.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.118
Thanks.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.820
I guess this is it.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.388
Guess so.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.307
I just want you to know...

39:57.351 --> 39:59.832
you're a good person.

39:59.875 --> 40:03.139
And you deserve a good life.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.838
I believe that now.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.535
I mean...

40:07.579 --> 40:09.624
I must have been...

40:09.668 --> 40:12.148
for someone like you to love me.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.719
If you ever need anything...

40:17.763 --> 40:20.200
Yeah. You, too.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.465
So long, Jane.

40:24.509 --> 40:25.814
Wait.

40:27.642 --> 40:30.558
I'm never gonna use this.

40:30.602 --> 40:33.431
Oh.

40:47.749 --> 40:49.751
Good-bye, Jason.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.124
I love you.

41:18.519 --> 41:19.477
I love you, too.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.309
Will you marry me?
