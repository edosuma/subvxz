18:00.462 --> 18:02.497
BUT WITH A NEW SEASON IN FRONT

18:02.531 --> 18:04.132
OF HIM, GREG'S GOT HIS SIGHTS

18:04.166 --> 18:05.767
ON THE ROAD AHEAD.

18:12.307 --> 18:15.510
THE HAUL ROAD ACE IS OUT AHEAD.

18:15.577 --> 18:17.745
WE NEED TO HAVE HIM BEHIND US

18:17.780 --> 18:19.781
AND KEEP HIM BEHIND US FOR THE

18:19.848 --> 18:26.053
DURATION OF THE ICE ROAD SEASON.

18:26.088 --> 18:27.388
>> IN THE SOUTHERN FOOTHILLS OF

LONELIEST 30 MILES OF ROAD ON

18:30.826 --> 18:32.760

18:32.828 --> 18:34.462
BRANCHING OFF THE DALTON AND

18:34.496 --> 18:36.030
DEAD-ENDING AT THE TOWN OF

18:57.219 --> 18:59.020
OUT OF THE YEAR THAT THE RIVERS

18:59.054 --> 19:01.656
FREEZE DEEP ENOUGH...

19:01.723 --> 19:03.491
SO THE MOST HARDCORE OF ICE ROAD

19:03.559 --> 19:07.395
TRUCKERS CAN ROLL.

19:07.462 --> 19:08.930
>> THIS IS REALLY LIKE OLD-TIME

19:08.997 --> 19:10.131
TRUCKING IN ALASKA.

19:10.199 --> 19:11.499

19:11.567 --> 19:13.301
YEARS AND YEARS AGO.

DO IT OUTSIDE."

19:34.323 --> 19:36.090

19:47.603 --> 19:50.304
STARTED TO WARM UP THE ROAD, IT

19:50.339 --> 19:51.639
TURNED INTO A BOG.

19:51.673 --> 19:55.676
ONE LONG, 400-MILE MUD HOLE.

19:55.711 --> 19:57.211
>> IT HASN'T IMPROVED IN THE 40

20:33.815 --> 20:35.182
TEST HOLES TO SEE HOW THICK THIS

20:35.217 --> 20:37.551

26:59.401 --> 27:03.671

>> UH-OH, THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S

27:16.151 --> 27:23.957

27:46.414 --> 27:48.482
CHANGE DIRECTION OR START USING

27:48.516 --> 27:54.321
A BUNCH OF BRAKES.

>> THE TEMPERATURE HITS THE

27:56.391 --> 27:57.391
CRITICAL MARK...

27:57.459 --> 28:00.027
JUST AS ALEX ENTERS ANOTHER

28:00.095 --> 28:03.397
DANGER ZONE.

28:03.465 --> 28:05.299
WARM TEMPERATURES CAN ALSO

28:05.333 --> 28:06.767
TRIGGER AVALANCHES.

>> HANG ON TO YOUR SOCKS.

WITHOUT AN AVALANCHE OR A

28:51.896 --> 28:53.197
ROAD.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.099
WORD HAS COME IN THAT THE DRIVER

28:55.133 --> 28:56.433
IS OKAY.

NOW A D.O.T. ROAD CREW IS ON

28:58.703 --> 28:59.737
THE SCENE.

28:59.771 --> 29:01.638

TRAFFIC BACKING UP, THE WHOLE

29:03.374 --> 29:05.642
SEASON IS ON HOLD UNTIL THE

29:05.677 --> 29:06.844
WRECK IS CLEARED.

IT, TIE OFF TO THE TRUCK, AND

29:10.181 --> 29:12.249
JUST TRY AND DRAG IT BACK OVER

29:12.283 --> 29:13.650
AND FLIP IT WITHOUT GOING IN THE

29:13.718 --> 29:15.018
DITCH WITH THE LOADERS.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.820
>> WHEN IT'S THIS COLD, METAL

29:16.888 --> 29:19.022
BECOMES BRITTLE, CHAINS SNAP

29:19.057 --> 29:20.424
WITHOUT WARNING.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.459
INCH-BY-INCH, THE CAT DRIVERS

29:22.494 --> 29:24.561
LEVERAGE THE TONS OF STRAINING

29:24.629 --> 29:27.798
METAL.

UNTIL...

29:30.735 --> 29:39.343
[loud thud]

29:39.377 --> 29:41.178
AT LAST LIGHT, THE CREW FINALLY

29:41.246 --> 29:42.880
CLEARS THE ROAD INTO PRUDHOE

29:42.914 --> 29:47.251

29:47.285 --> 29:49.353
NIGHTFALL, THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

29:49.420 --> 29:54.358
FLARE ACROSS THE SKY.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.899
BUT EVEN THE KING OF HEAVY HAUL,

30:01.966 --> 30:04.168

>> I'VE FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO

30:24.255 --> 30:24.888
YOU.

30:24.923 --> 30:25.689
STARTING TO WONDER IF I WAS

30:25.723 --> 30:26.356
GOING TO.

30:26.391 --> 30:27.090
>> I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE

30:42.440 --> 30:47.277
COLDFOOT, GREG NEEDS TO REFUEL.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.079
GIVING JACK AN OPPORTUNITY TO

30:49.147 --> 30:50.280
TAKE THE LEAD.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.049
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.618
>> WE ARE LEAN AND LIMBER.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.600
IT'S THE ROOKIE.

37:16.667 --> 37:17.867
>> I'M HAPPY.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.035
IT'S FIRST LOAD OF THE SEASON,

37:19.070 --> 37:20.437
SO THAT'S GOOD.

37:20.471 --> 37:22.372
>> AFTER SURVIVING A BAD

37:22.440 --> 37:24.341
SPINOUT ON ATIGUN PASS,

37:24.375 --> 37:26.243
RAY VEILLEUX SETTLED DOWN AND

37:26.277 --> 37:27.244
MADE GOOD.

37:27.311 --> 37:29.079
>> YOU KNOW, I'M JUST A ROOKIE.

37:29.146 --> 37:29.980
I'M THE NEW GUY.

37:30.047 --> 37:31.514
I JUST GOT LUCKY.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.582
YOU KNOW, AND KEPT IT ON THE

37:32.617 --> 37:33.483
ROAD AND GOT THE FIRST LOAD UP

37:33.517 --> 37:34.317
THERE.

37:34.352 --> 37:36.353
JUST KEPT TRUCKIN'.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.054
>> 20 MILES SOUTH OF PRUDHOE

37:38.122 --> 37:40.624
BAY, GREG BOADWINE'S STILL

37:40.691 --> 37:42.325
GUNNING TO PASS JACK JESSEE.

37:42.393 --> 37:45.161
THOUGH HE'S RUNNING OUT OF ROAD.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.396
>> I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE SEEN

37:46.430 --> 37:48.164
OUR HAUL ROAD ACE JACK JESSEE

37:48.232 --> 37:48.865
FLOATING AROUND UP HERE

37:48.899 --> 37:49.532
SOMEWHERE.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.967
>> NO, I SURE HAVEN'T SEEN

37:51.035 --> 37:52.068
HIM YET.

37:52.136 --> 37:53.069
>> JEEZ, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

37:53.137 --> 37:53.970
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM YET, I

37:54.038 --> 37:54.971
GUESS HE'S ALREADY BEAT ME INTO

37:55.006 --> 37:59.509
TOWN.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.878
>> THEN, ON THE HORIZON...

38:01.912 --> 38:04.047
>> JACK.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.882
>> TAIL LIGHTS.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.418
>> ¶ WE GOT US A JACK ¶

38:08.452 --> 38:10.120
YOU CAN SEE JACK JESSEE'S STROBE

38:10.154 --> 38:12.322
LIGHTS UP THERE.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.857
ALL RIGHT, WE FINALLY SEE HIM.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.325
TIME TO GO GET HIM.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.526
PROBABLY GOT THREE, FOUR MILES

38:16.560 --> 38:17.494
ON ME.

38:17.528 --> 38:19.029
I GUESS WE LUCKED OUT AFTER ALL

38:19.063 --> 38:23.933
AND WE'RE GONNA GET THE KING.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.302
>> YOU THINK HE'D SLOW DOWN A

38:25.336 --> 38:26.403
LITTLE MORE OR SOMETHING.

38:26.437 --> 38:28.772
>> OH, THAT ALWAYS WORKS.

38:28.839 --> 38:30.307
>> [laughing]

38:30.341 --> 38:31.708
>> PRETTY SURE WE GOT JUST

38:31.742 --> 38:35.045
ENOUGH DISTANCE TO CATCH HIM.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.146
GOTTA CATCH THE KING.

38:36.213 --> 38:37.314
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA KNOCK HIM OFF

38:37.381 --> 38:39.883
HIS THRONE.

38:39.950 --> 38:42.152
>> NOW TWO DRIVERS DUEL TO THE

38:42.219 --> 38:42.852
FINISH.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.954
THE ACE, JACK JESSEE.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.490
THE UPSTART, GREG BOADWINE.

38:47.525 --> 38:48.858
>> WE GOT JUST ENOUGH DISTANCE

38:48.926 --> 38:50.293
TO CATCH THE KING BEFORE MAKING

38:50.328 --> 38:51.761
IT TO PRUDHOE.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.697
TIME TO GO GET HIM.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.498
>> TWO MILES TO GO, GREG IS

38:55.566 --> 38:57.334
RIGHT ON JACK'S TAIL LIGHTS

38:57.368 --> 38:58.968
LOOKING FOR ROOM TO PASS.

38:59.003 --> 38:59.703
>> AH, THERE'S GREG.

38:59.770 --> 39:01.304
GREG FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH US.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.572
>> TOOK US THE WHOLE TRIP, BUT

39:02.606 --> 39:03.340
HERE WE ARE.

39:03.407 --> 39:04.507
>> I FIGURED HE'D CATCH US A

39:04.542 --> 39:06.943
LITTLE SOONER THAN THAT.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.245
>> JACK IS RUNNING SLOWER BUT

39:09.280 --> 39:11.214
BIGGER AND IS MORE OF AN

39:11.248 --> 39:14.184
OBSTACLE TO PASS.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.329
AFTER CHASING THE KING FOR 500

39:26.397 --> 39:27.831
MILES...

39:27.865 --> 39:31.334
GREG COMES UP A FEW FEET SHORT.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.603
>> OH, YEAH.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.772
STILL WORKING ON YOU, BY GOD.

39:35.840 --> 39:39.509
>> [laughing]

39:39.577 --> 39:40.510
>> YOU GOT ME.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.311
>> WELL, I'M GLAD YOU FINALLY

39:41.379 --> 39:42.479
MADE IT, I STARTED TO GET

39:42.513 --> 39:43.847
WORRIED FOR A SECOND.

39:43.881 --> 39:44.948
>> JACK GAVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF

39:44.982 --> 39:46.015
CRAP TODAY.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.484
IT'S BASIC BANTER.

39:47.551 --> 39:48.852
THE MORE HE GIVES ME CRAP, THE

39:48.919 --> 39:50.420
MORE I THINK HE MIGHT ACTUALLY

39:50.488 --> 39:51.287
RESPECT ME.

39:51.322 --> 39:52.188
>> GLAD YOU MADE IT.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.056
>> THE MORE HE GIVES ME CRAP,

39:53.090 --> 39:54.691
THE BETTER I FEEL ABOUT IT.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.960
>> BUT WHAT MAKES A FAMILY BACK

39:57.027 --> 39:59.229
HOME FEEL GOOD IS JUST TWO

39:59.263 --> 40:01.765
WORDS--DAD'S OKAY.

40:01.832 --> 40:03.400
>> HI, HONEY.

40:03.467 --> 40:04.601
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

40:04.668 --> 40:05.769
>> I'M IN PRUDHOE.

40:05.803 --> 40:07.003
>> ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU.

40:07.037 --> 40:07.837
>> ALL RIGHT, TELL THE KIDS I

40:07.872 --> 40:09.305
SAID HI AND LOVE 'EM.

40:09.373 --> 40:10.373
>> ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.374
>> ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU TOO.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.208
>> BYE.

40:12.276 --> 40:14.210
>> BYE.

40:14.278 --> 40:16.846
>> FIVE MILES BACK, EMERGING

40:16.881 --> 40:18.014
FROM THE DARKNESS OF THE

40:18.048 --> 40:18.848
TUNDRA...

40:18.883 --> 40:21.317
>> WE ARE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.453
>> IS LISA KELLY.

40:23.487 --> 40:24.654
>> I'M ALMOST TO THE PRUDHOE BAY

40:24.688 --> 40:27.190
HERE, AND, UH, JUST ABOUT

40:27.224 --> 40:29.125
FINISHING UP THIS TRIP.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.127
>> HALFWAY THROUGH, LISA HAD TO

40:31.162 --> 40:33.096
SUCK UP HER PRIDE AND SWAP

40:33.130 --> 40:34.364
TRAILERS WITH HER RUNNING

40:34.398 --> 40:35.498
PARTNER, RYAN.

40:35.566 --> 40:38.234
>> IT IS 34 BELOW.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.303
>> SHE'S WORRIED IT WILL HAUNT

40:40.371 --> 40:42.739
HER FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.541
>> LISA'S CONCERN WAS THAT THE

40:44.575 --> 40:45.542
OTHER DRIVERS OUT THERE WERE

40:45.576 --> 40:46.843
GONNA GIVE HER A HARD TIME FOR

40:46.877 --> 40:48.411
SWAPPING LOADS, AND THAT SHE

40:48.479 --> 40:49.746
COULDN'T HANDLE THAT LOAD.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.048
AND THAT I DISCOUNT THAT

40:52.082 --> 40:53.116
COMPLETELY.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.018
>> THEY SAY WOMEN GOSSIP?

40:55.085 --> 40:55.819
[scoff]

40:55.853 --> 40:57.654
TRY TRUCKERS.

40:57.688 --> 41:02.025
THEY'RE THE WORST.

41:02.092 --> 41:04.661
>> DAYBREAK, DAY TWO.

41:04.728 --> 41:06.663
AFTER HIS NIGHT DELIVERY TO

41:06.730 --> 41:09.032
PRUDHOE BAY, ALEX DEBOGORSKI

41:09.066 --> 41:11.267
STARTS ON HIS SECOND LEG.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.136
FAR ACROSS THE RIVER ICE TO THE

41:13.204 --> 41:17.040
VILLAGE OF NUIQSUT.

41:17.107 --> 41:18.475
>> I'VE GOT LOADER TIRES FOR THE

41:18.509 --> 41:20.410
AIRPORT LOADER, I THINK, AND A

41:20.478 --> 41:25.215
BUNCH OF LUMBER.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.484
I'LL BE DRIVING ON ICE...

41:27.518 --> 41:31.221
ON THE FROZEN WATER.

41:31.288 --> 41:33.656
>> HE REACHES THE ICE BRIDGE ON

41:33.724 --> 41:36.659
THE COLVILLE RIVER.

41:36.727 --> 41:39.095
BUT THE SNOWPACK IS SO DEEP

41:39.129 --> 41:40.763
THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TELL WHERE

41:40.831 --> 41:42.398
THE TUNDRA ENDS AND THE RIVER

41:42.466 --> 41:44.934
BEGINS...

41:45.002 --> 41:49.906
IS THE SOUND OF ICE CRACKING.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.741
>> HERE, YOU'RE ON WATER.

41:51.809 --> 41:54.477
WHOA, BABY.

41:54.545 --> 42:01.384
[cracking]

42:01.452 --> 42:03.219
EVEN WITH BEING EXPERIENCED IN

42:03.287 --> 42:04.354
DRIVING ON ICE, IT'S STILL A

42:04.388 --> 42:05.655
LITTLE NERVE-WRACKING WHEN

42:05.689 --> 42:07.290
YOU'RE DRIVING OVER A LONG

42:07.324 --> 42:09.292
DISTANCE OF WATER.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.361
>> RIVER ICE IS SHOT THROUGH

42:11.395 --> 42:14.931
WITH POCKETS OF FLOWING WATER.

42:14.965 --> 42:17.000
SOME ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO SWALLOW

42:17.034 --> 42:20.003
A BIG RIG.

42:35.152 --> 42:36.719
>> ONE MORE BEND AND WE'RE IN

42:36.754 --> 42:40.390
NUIQSUT.

42:40.424 --> 42:42.525
>> THE ICE BUCKLES AND MOVES ONE

42:42.560 --> 42:44.093
FINAL TIME.

42:44.161 --> 42:46.829
AND ALEX IS ONCE AGAIN ON STEADY

42:46.897 --> 42:52.068
GROUND.

42:52.102 --> 42:54.203
AFTER A YEAR-LONG WAIT AND A

42:54.271 --> 42:56.539
560-MILE JOURNEY FROM

42:56.574 --> 42:57.740
FAIRBANKS...

42:57.808 --> 42:59.008
>> HI, HOW'S IT GOING?

42:59.043 --> 43:01.744
>> ALEX DELIVERS THE FIRST LOAD

43:01.779 --> 43:03.346
OF THE SEASON FROM ACROSS THE

43:03.380 --> 43:05.915
ICE.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.183
>> GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR

43:07.217 --> 43:08.351
FAMILY, AND THANK YOU FOR

43:08.385 --> 43:09.452
EVERYTHING.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.821
>> ALEX IS FIRST TO PRUDHOE BAY

43:11.855 --> 43:14.824
AND FIRST ACROSS THE ICE.

43:14.858 --> 43:17.660
BUT JUST AS ONE CANADIAN GRABS

43:17.728 --> 43:20.430
THE LEAD, THE INVASION KICKS UP

43:20.464 --> 43:22.065
A GEAR.

43:22.099 --> 43:26.002
>> FINALLY, BACK IN ALASKA.

43:26.036 --> 43:27.370
THEM GUYS THAT WERE MAKING ALL

43:27.404 --> 43:28.538
THEM BETS AND SAYING I WASN'T

43:28.572 --> 43:29.372
GONNA SHOW UP--THEY'RE GONNA

43:29.440 --> 43:30.273
[bleep] THEIR PANTS WHEN THEY

43:30.307 --> 43:31.441
FIND OUT POLAR BEAR'S BACK

43:31.475 --> 43:32.542
IN DODGE.
