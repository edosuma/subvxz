02:25.225 --> 02:29.423
[radio] And now for all you romantics
out there, this one is for you.

02:34.301 --> 02:36.292
Hello, Betty.

02:37.671 --> 02:42.973
Shouldn't you be at the hospital,
looking after a certain other soldier?

02:43.043 --> 02:46.274
Is there any way you can find it
in your heart to forgive me?

02:48.348 --> 02:51.181
I wonder if these two get together.

02:54.488 --> 02:57.821
I'll forgive you on one condition.

02:57.891 --> 03:02.294
- What's that?
- Dance with me.

03:28.755 --> 03:30.746
Explain one thing to me.

03:32.125 --> 03:38.325
What kind of desperate and pathetic
emotional cripple

03:38.398 --> 03:40.923
would actually buy that as an ending?

03:47.407 --> 03:50.535
Rosie, do you think that in real life

03:50.610 --> 03:54.046
Tad Hamilton is the man
he seems to be on the screen?

03:54.114 --> 03:58.813
Absolutely. I mean,
you just can't fake that kind of thing.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.115
What do you think Tad Hamilton
is doing right now?

04:05.859 --> 04:07.486
I'll bet he's in church.

04:13.867 --> 04:14.856
[Tad] Watch this.

04:17.971 --> 04:20.098
[Tad] Yeah! Whoo!

04:25.979 --> 04:28.345
- Told you that was him, right?
- Yeah.

04:28.415 --> 04:29.313
Tad Hamilton.

04:29.382 --> 04:32.010
[Driven Levy]
You don't make it easy on us, Tad.

04:32.085 --> 04:33.382
[Tad] What do you mean?

04:33.453 --> 04:35.444
This is the shot the paparazzi got.

04:37.791 --> 04:41.352
Congratulations. You're actually
drinking, driving, smoking,

04:41.428 --> 04:43.726
leering and groping at the same time.

04:43.797 --> 04:48.825
Which, on the one hand, is just about
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

04:48.902 --> 04:49.960
Richard.

04:50.036 --> 04:55.201
But, on the other hand, it can be argued
this might be bad for the image.

04:55.275 --> 04:57.436
You play characters who have heart.

04:57.510 --> 05:00.343
This is a person
who will have a heart attack.

05:00.413 --> 05:04.679
I can't believe you guys are blaming
my unemployment on this photograph.

05:04.751 --> 05:09.017
You are not unemployed.
Dockworkers are unemployed.

05:09.089 --> 05:12.490
You are simply between
million-dollar paydays.

05:12.559 --> 05:18.327
As are we, since we both get
a percentage of your payday.

05:19.532 --> 05:21.523
But this isn't about us.

05:21.601 --> 05:26.629
Whatever happened to that part in the
Jimmy Ing movie? I'm perfect for that.

05:26.706 --> 05:29.607
Well, he's taking a breath.

05:30.710 --> 05:33.577
- He's what?
- He's taking a breath.

05:33.647 --> 05:35.706
He's pausing before deciding.

05:35.782 --> 05:38.216
He's hemming and hawing
and taking a breath.

05:38.284 --> 05:41.378
And this is only going
to make him breathe more.

05:41.454 --> 05:45.220
- What do we do?
- Asphyxiate the son of a bitch.

05:45.291 --> 05:48.818
- We generate a little positive PR.
- What are you, an interpreter?

05:48.895 --> 05:53.559
I'm saying we just need
to do something, Tad,

05:53.633 --> 05:57.296
to remind Jimmy Ing and America
that you are the boy next door.

05:57.370 --> 05:59.429
I am the boy next door,

05:59.506 --> 06:03.704
if you happen to live
in a very dysfunctional neighborhood.

06:43.283 --> 06:49.119
[Pete] Congratulations. You've eaten
your body weight in Pringles.

06:49.189 --> 06:51.180
What's your favorite Pringle?

06:51.257 --> 06:53.817
Sour cream and onion or original?

06:53.893 --> 06:58.193
Well, the sour cream and onion
has a very strong taste.

06:58.264 --> 07:01.825
So if you're eating a small amount,
half a can, you want that strength.

07:01.901 --> 07:06.065
But if you're eating more, you want
the original. It's a cleaner flavor.

07:06.139 --> 07:11.133
Wait until you discover barbecue flavor.
You'll finally become a woman.

07:11.211 --> 07:14.339
How's Modern Grocer
treating you over there, Pete?

07:14.414 --> 07:16.905
This is the swimsuit issue.

07:22.555 --> 07:25.922
- oh, my God.
- What is it?

07:25.992 --> 07:28.586
- Win a date with Tad Hamilton.
- What?

07:28.661 --> 07:30.925
It's to benefit Save the Children.

07:30.997 --> 07:34.262
- That is so like him.
- Saving children. I know.

07:34.334 --> 07:35.767
Ohhh!

07:38.138 --> 07:41.232
- Should I enter?
- Why not?

07:41.307 --> 07:44.037
Sure. Heaven is just a mouse click away.

07:45.478 --> 07:47.810
A mouse click and 1 00-buck donation.

07:47.881 --> 07:50.213
We can raise 1 00 bucks.

07:54.487 --> 07:58.617
- With your permission, Petey.
- I'm sorry?

08:01.661 --> 08:03.629
- Paper or plastic?
- Paper, please.

08:03.696 --> 08:08.497
Would you help Rosalee win a date with
Tad Hamilton and help Save the Children?

08:08.568 --> 08:10.502
I certainly would.

08:15.842 --> 08:18.936
- Aren't these great?
- The best.

08:19.012 --> 08:21.537
Along with a $1 25 check

08:21.614 --> 08:26.210
in recognition of yet another Piggly
Wiggly Store Manager of the Month Award.

08:26.286 --> 08:29.153
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Mr. Ruddy.

08:29.222 --> 08:31.690
So, Pete, when do we
lose you to Richmond?

08:31.758 --> 08:34.283
Because you're running
out of wall space here.

08:35.761 --> 08:39.198
Well, I got my acceptance letter
to Virginia State.

08:39.265 --> 08:42.428
- That's good.
- And I got my student loan.

08:42.501 --> 08:46.598
So, there's just one more thing.

08:46.673 --> 08:49.904
- What?
- There's someone here that I...

08:52.278 --> 08:54.269
I need to have a discussion with

08:54.347 --> 08:58.010
about the going
to Richmond with me issue.

09:01.354 --> 09:03.515
Jars are full.

09:04.557 --> 09:07.458
I love everybody in this store so much.

09:07.527 --> 09:10.690
Sorry for interrupting. Sorry.

09:28.481 --> 09:30.711
It was nice to meet you.

09:30.783 --> 09:32.842
It was nice to meet you, too.

09:32.919 --> 09:35.251
- Good night.
- Good night.

09:39.993 --> 09:41.483
- Are you taking off?
- Yes, sir.

09:41.561 --> 09:43.153
Muchas gracias.

09:43.229 --> 09:45.697
Hasta el próximo miércoles.

09:46.900 --> 09:50.233
I am the Albanian one, Mr. Hamilton.

09:50.303 --> 09:53.431
I'm sorry.
Could you tell the other one...

09:53.506 --> 09:57.033
"Muchas gracias" and
"hasta el próximo miércoles."

09:57.110 --> 09:59.101
- Will do.
- Thank you.

11:15.188 --> 11:17.383
oK, what do I need to beat you?

11:18.858 --> 11:22.089
Double 1 4, or it's all over.

11:22.161 --> 11:24.652
That's not going to be a problem.

11:26.332 --> 11:30.928
Don't miss. Don't miss, don't miss,
don't miss, don't miss, don't miss.

11:31.004 --> 11:33.802
Um, are you actually doing that? Yeah.

11:44.450 --> 11:49.114
And now Pete will get
the bartendress's attention.

11:49.188 --> 11:53.386
- She's waiting for you.
- And we're waiting for our round, Pete.

11:54.494 --> 11:56.485
Fine.

11:58.564 --> 11:59.929
Angelica.

12:06.506 --> 12:10.772
Yes, Pete?
What is the object of your desire?

12:14.080 --> 12:16.275
We need another round.

12:17.517 --> 12:20.748
one day, Pete, one day,

12:20.820 --> 12:24.551
I know that the answer to that question
will be "You, Angelica."

12:24.624 --> 12:28.151
"You are the object of my desire."

12:29.562 --> 12:33.760
oK. But for now
we'll just go with the beers.

12:43.042 --> 12:45.411
oh, Pete.

12:45.451 --> 12:47.402
Enough. Thank you, ladies.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.971
You don't like her
the teeniest, tiniest bit?

12:50.049 --> 12:52.040
What? Rosie...

12:52.118 --> 12:54.882
No, she's not my type, oK?

12:54.954 --> 12:57.650
[Rosie] You are so particular.

12:57.723 --> 12:59.714
Who the heck are they?

13:00.726 --> 13:03.388
If that fire alarm went off again...

13:03.463 --> 13:06.091
[Pete] Why would they send
a news crew for that?

13:06.165 --> 13:07.928
Wait a second.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.199
Right here, please.

13:22.515 --> 13:27.009
In first class you get a DVD player
and may view the film of your choice.

13:27.086 --> 13:30.021
I'd like to touch intimately
whoever thought of that.

13:30.089 --> 13:33.718
[announcer] We would like to begin
boarding our first-class passengers.

13:33.793 --> 13:36.421
- That's you.
- I know.

13:36.496 --> 13:38.623
Guys. Just take it easy, oK?

13:38.698 --> 13:42.259
Just give me a hug and tell me
to have a good time, please?

13:42.335 --> 13:43.768
oK.

13:47.106 --> 13:50.837
Just be careful, oK?

13:51.511 --> 13:54.912
- What do you mean?
- I mean that this guy is Tad Hamilton.

13:54.981 --> 13:59.748
In his life, he's probably
slept with like 1 5, 20 women.

14:00.987 --> 14:03.854
No way. That's not even
physically possible.

14:03.923 --> 14:07.086
Besides, like he's going
to be interested in me.

14:07.160 --> 14:12.757
If he claims he doesn't like watching
sports, he's trying to sleep with you.

14:12.832 --> 14:14.163
Got it.

14:14.233 --> 14:17.464
If he claims to love animals,
he's trying to sleep with you.

14:17.537 --> 14:20.335
- ok.
- Guys are guys. Rich or poor.

14:20.406 --> 14:23.466
Famous or grocers.

14:23.543 --> 14:26.603
- Right.
- Just do me one favor, ok?

14:28.814 --> 14:31.180
- Guard your carnal treasure.
- ok.

14:31.250 --> 14:34.378
- Just guard your carnal treasure.
- Thanks, Pete.

14:34.453 --> 14:36.648
- Remember everything.
- I will.

14:36.722 --> 14:39.156
- Remember how he smells.
- I will.

14:39.225 --> 14:42.194
But not just vaguely.
I want good, solid similes.

14:42.261 --> 14:47.790
For example: he smells like a forest
on the first day of spring.

14:47.867 --> 14:51.462
oK, Cathy.
You're going to miss your flight.

14:51.537 --> 14:54.165
- I will bring you similes.
- Thank you.

14:55.241 --> 14:58.142
I almost forgot. I got you something.

14:58.211 --> 15:00.975
It's regular flavor.

15:01.981 --> 15:05.849
In case you don't like
the prime rib in first class.

15:06.619 --> 15:08.951
Thank you, Pete.

15:12.391 --> 15:14.382
Right this way.

15:17.763 --> 15:21.358
- Just guard your carnal treasure.
- I heard you.

15:56.636 --> 15:59.605
- That's me.
- Welcome to Los Angeles.

17:05.003 --> 17:06.800
Oh!

17:07.440 --> 17:10.500
- Can I have these?
- No.

17:10.576 --> 17:12.874
Do you want to think about it?

17:12.944 --> 17:14.970
Gee, what...

17:15.047 --> 17:17.880
Tell me why you're making me
have dinner with an okie.

17:17.950 --> 17:21.317
Because she's wholesome
as the amber waves of grain.

17:21.387 --> 17:24.185
And she's not an okie.
She's from West Virginia.

17:25.156 --> 17:27.147
So sorry.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.354
You never wear them.
Can I just have them?

17:31.697 --> 17:35.098
- So what's her name anyway?
- Rosalee Futch.

17:35.167 --> 17:37.328
Sounds insanely hot.

17:37.403 --> 17:40.065
It's very nice to meet you, Tad.

17:41.474 --> 17:44.136
It's so nice to meet you, Tad.

17:45.177 --> 17:47.975
It's great to meet you.

17:48.047 --> 17:50.038
Please, just follow the rules.

17:50.116 --> 17:53.051
"Smile for the cameras.
No brown liquor or cigarettes."

17:53.119 --> 17:55.110
- Fine.
- Very good.

17:55.187 --> 17:57.678
What about Jimmy Ing?
Have we heard anything?

17:57.757 --> 17:59.588
No. Still breathing.

17:59.658 --> 18:02.491
I passed Ashton Kutcher in my car
and he seemed happy.

18:02.561 --> 18:06.827
He's happy for other reasons. I'm sorry.
We have not heard from Jimmy Ing.

18:06.899 --> 18:09.595
Hey, guys, how's this in the shoulders?

18:10.736 --> 18:11.815
Seriously.
Because I got some yoga stuff.

18:16.455 --> 18:19.578
Your films will stand the test of time.

18:23.322 --> 18:26.689
Your films will stand the test of time.

18:37.770 --> 18:40.830
Hi. I'm Tad.

18:43.209 --> 18:47.270
Your standing films will time
and test themselves.

18:49.448 --> 18:52.611
Thank you. You're pretty.

18:53.819 --> 18:56.913
It's Roseanne, right?
I'm sorry, what is it?

18:58.891 --> 19:01.416
Ricky?

19:01.494 --> 19:03.860
- It's Rosalee.
- Rosalee.

19:03.929 --> 19:06.727
Rosalee. Nice to meet you.

19:08.401 --> 19:12.667
- So, you ready? ok, let's...

19:17.243 --> 19:19.234
Yikes-a-bee.

19:21.113 --> 19:23.946
So, how was your flight?

19:24.016 --> 19:26.678
Your films will stand the test of time.

19:28.788 --> 19:30.119
Thank you.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.758
- So, you ready?
- For what?

19:33.826 --> 19:35.817
Right this way.

19:52.511 --> 19:54.376
Rosalee Futch.

20:05.624 --> 20:09.617
[Tad] lt'll take a few minutes for the spots
in your eyes to go away, but they will.

20:09.695 --> 20:12.687
- oK.
- We're right here.

20:15.034 --> 20:17.059
Is it always like that?

20:19.004 --> 20:23.031
Well, pretty much.

20:23.876 --> 20:26.401
- Shake-a-doo.
- Shake a what?

20:27.780 --> 20:29.907
It just means "Wow."

20:32.218 --> 20:35.676
Shake-a-doo.
Shake-a-doo, I like that.

20:35.755 --> 20:37.746
So...

20:39.191 --> 20:41.955
- You excited?
- Are you kidding?

20:42.027 --> 20:45.622
- This is like a fairy tale.
- Yeah, I figured.

20:50.336 --> 20:53.635
- You oK?
- Yeah.

20:53.706 --> 20:56.436
I'm just not used to sitting
sideways like this.

20:59.011 --> 21:02.105
We don't have sideways seating
in West Virginia.

21:02.181 --> 21:05.480
And I think the cigarette smoke
is kind of...

21:05.551 --> 21:08.577
You can come sit back here if you like.

21:09.155 --> 21:11.146
I can't really move right now.

21:12.124 --> 21:16.151
Boy, I don't feel well. I've always been
kind of motion sickness-y.

21:16.228 --> 21:18.788
once, this carnival
came to Fraziers Bottom,

21:18.864 --> 21:21.424
and they had that ride
where it spins around

21:21.500 --> 21:27.439
and you have to stand against the side
and the center falls out.

21:27.506 --> 21:30.134
- And I...
- Damn it.

21:32.111 --> 21:33.635
- Pardon me.

21:33.712 --> 21:35.179
Ahh!

21:38.984 --> 21:42.317
This is just so far from the way
I imagined the evening going.

21:45.291 --> 21:48.454
It's perfectly all right.
Right, Mickey?

21:48.527 --> 21:50.893
- Perfectly all right.
- [Tad] Shall we?

21:50.963 --> 21:54.228
[Mickey] Have a nice dinner.
I'll just be out here scrubbing.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.995
[Tad] Hey, Steve.

21:56.068 --> 21:59.162
- Good to see you, Mr. Hamilton.
- Good to see you, Larry.

21:59.238 --> 22:02.537
- Hey, man, how are you?
- What's up?

22:15.754 --> 22:17.654
Hey.

22:17.723 --> 22:19.714
This way.

22:23.963 --> 22:27.057
Doesn't it hurt,
smiling like that all the time?

22:28.834 --> 22:31.359
You get used to it.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.428
- Should I do it?
- Yeah.

22:33.505 --> 22:36.167
You might not be able
to hold it long, but go for it.

22:36.242 --> 22:38.233
Sure I will.

22:43.916 --> 22:47.215
See that?
It sort of gets you right there.

22:47.286 --> 22:50.722
- That's horrible.
- I told you.

22:52.057 --> 22:55.618
- You sure do have a lot of stuff.
- Yeah, sorry.

22:55.694 --> 22:58.663
I'm never out of touch
with the people who torment me.

22:58.731 --> 23:00.961
Who are they?

23:01.033 --> 23:04.434
Agents, managers, people like that.

23:04.503 --> 23:08.030
This man, Jimmy Ing, who's
making this movie I'm exactly right for

23:08.107 --> 23:11.008
but, for whatever reason,
he's taking a breath.

23:11.076 --> 23:14.341
- A what?
- He's thinking it over.

23:14.413 --> 23:18.713
It's just all very competitive,
this business, that's all.

23:18.784 --> 23:21.878
Everybody seems to be
chasing the same thing.

23:21.954 --> 23:26.288
The same parts in the same movies,
the same awards, the same big money.

23:27.326 --> 23:31.285
Well, I'm sure you have too much common
sense to get caught up in all that.

23:33.332 --> 23:36.995
I mean, it's just a recipe
for an unsatisfying life.

23:40.639 --> 23:43.472
obviously you have
your priorities straight, so...

23:45.110 --> 23:49.706
- So, Rosalee, what do you do?
- I work in a Piggly Wiggly.

23:49.782 --> 23:52.444
- I'm sorry?
- A supermarket.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.509
- I bag and check.
- Cool.

23:54.586 --> 23:56.645
Yeah. It's a real dream come true.

23:58.157 --> 24:01.126
But it's fun.
My two best friends work there.

24:05.030 --> 24:08.932
So, what do you do, Tad?

24:09.868 --> 24:12.166
Oops.

24:13.739 --> 24:19.439
What I mean is, what do you do
when you're not doing what you do?

24:19.511 --> 24:21.479
Not a lot, you know.

24:23.015 --> 24:26.610
There's not a lot of time
left for hobbies, really.

24:26.685 --> 24:31.281
And I don't really like watching sports,
so I read.

24:31.357 --> 24:35.851
Play with my dog,
my cat, my bird, you know.

24:36.862 --> 24:40.298
I... I love animals, you know?

24:45.170 --> 24:48.367
What do you think
they're doing right now?

24:48.440 --> 24:53.707
I bet they're in her hotel room,
straining for breath.

24:53.779 --> 24:56.907
His manhood yearning to be free.

24:56.982 --> 25:00.850
Her hands running over
the ripples in his abdomen.

25:00.919 --> 25:04.446
Her perfect bosom crying out in ecstasy.

25:08.994 --> 25:10.689
Great.

25:10.763 --> 25:12.754
All righty.

25:27.046 --> 25:30.243
- I had one of those.
- A retainer?

25:30.315 --> 25:34.081
Yeah, on the lowers
and a night brace for the uppers.

25:34.153 --> 25:36.144
I had really bad teeth as a kid.

25:36.221 --> 25:38.815
Yeah, I'm sure
you were a real ugly duckling.

25:38.891 --> 25:43.885
I was like anybody else.
A little gawky, unsure who I was.

25:43.962 --> 25:46.226
Combination skin.

25:47.366 --> 25:50.563
- Well, you came together nicely.
- Thank you.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.629
So did you.

25:58.544 --> 26:01.638
- Bon appétit!
- Umm-hmm!

26:19.798 --> 26:21.789
[Rosie] Thanks, Mickey.

26:27.039 --> 26:30.031
oh, wow. This is beautiful.

26:30.976 --> 26:34.377
These people sure leave
a lot of lights on.

26:34.446 --> 26:36.437
It's beautiful.

26:37.883 --> 26:39.874
It is.

26:42.054 --> 26:46.115
And you, if I may say so,
are also very beautiful.

26:50.329 --> 26:53.423
How would you like to come back
to my house for a little bit?

27:04.143 --> 27:06.805
Sure. For a little bit.

27:33.071 --> 27:37.735
- Shake-a-doo?
- No, shake-a-doo.

27:37.809 --> 27:39.800
Good.

27:45.017 --> 27:47.611
[Tad] Miss Ramirez.

27:47.686 --> 27:49.677
Sonja.

27:50.455 --> 27:52.047
Anybody in the casa?

27:58.297 --> 27:59.730
I think we're all alone.

28:00.999 --> 28:01.988
oh!

28:05.671 --> 28:08.663
Do you want to come in a little further?

28:11.710 --> 28:16.477
Um, you know what, Tad, thank you, but
I think I should get back to the hotel.

28:16.548 --> 28:17.879
Wow.

28:19.117 --> 28:20.448
oK.

28:21.553 --> 28:24.545
I don't want the concierge
to worry, you know.

28:25.791 --> 28:31.320
Good for you. Good for you.
I'll take you home.

28:31.396 --> 28:33.887
You don't have to do that.
You're already here.

28:33.966 --> 28:36.264
No, it would be my pleasure.

28:36.335 --> 28:39.668
oK, thanks.
That's really nice.

28:42.608 --> 28:45.839
Rosalee, it's been
wonderful to meet you.

28:45.911 --> 28:48.903
I wish you only good things in life.

28:49.982 --> 28:52.382
And to me, wonderfulness, too.

28:52.451 --> 28:56.444
And to you,
only the self same good wishes.

28:57.756 --> 29:00.657
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, of course.

29:00.726 --> 29:04.321
- Thanks for the best night of my life.
- No, thank you.

29:08.567 --> 29:11.058
May I give you a kiss goodbye?

29:12.437 --> 29:15.099
I think you might maybe may.

29:31.456 --> 29:34.050
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

29:36.895 --> 29:39.386
Good night, Rosalee.

29:43.101 --> 29:45.092
Sweet dreams.

30:02.621 --> 30:05.146
God!

30:19.204 --> 30:22.799
The limo door swung open.

30:24.009 --> 30:26.739
My foot hit the ground

30:26.812 --> 30:30.213
and I turned to take
one last look at Tad.

30:30.282 --> 30:33.843
At those eyes, at that smile.

30:33.919 --> 30:37.514
And then, regretfully,
I headed back for the hotel.

30:38.690 --> 30:42.456
- Please tell me we're done now.
- We're done.

30:42.527 --> 30:47.362
Wow. I cannot remember a time
before you started telling that story.

30:47.432 --> 30:51.163
Peter, I was asked to provide
a detailed description of the evening.

30:51.236 --> 30:54.262
And you did.
Actually, Rosie, you did a great job.

30:54.339 --> 30:56.637
I felt like I was there.

30:56.708 --> 30:58.733
Sort of against my will, but I did.

30:58.810 --> 31:01.210
oK, guys, with your permission,

31:01.279 --> 31:05.511
I think we should all now
return to our normal lives.

31:07.986 --> 31:10.011
oK.

31:10.088 --> 31:12.420
Actually...

31:13.525 --> 31:18.690
Rosie, I kind of had something
that I wanted to ask you.

31:24.536 --> 31:27.403
Rosie.

31:29.474 --> 31:31.465
Whatever.

31:32.377 --> 31:36.609
It's something that
I think you're going to like.

31:36.681 --> 31:39.275
I hope you're going to like.

31:39.351 --> 31:43.788
Something I really hope
you're going to like.

31:43.855 --> 31:47.689
It's been a long time coming,
so it might be kind of a surprise.

31:47.759 --> 31:50.592
or not, or maybe not. I don't know.

31:50.662 --> 31:52.755
I'm like...

31:53.865 --> 31:57.961
Look, oK,
what I'm trying to say is that

32:00.539 --> 32:02.097
I...

32:03.308 --> 32:05.299
Hey.

32:11.817 --> 32:15.184
Let me ask you, what would be
the absolute worst thing

32:15.253 --> 32:18.188
that could happen to me right now?

32:31.036 --> 32:33.527
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:35.674 --> 32:38.802
I'm Tad.

32:38.877 --> 32:41.004
This is my Cathy friend.

32:44.749 --> 32:47.274
- And my Pete friend.
- I'm Tad.

32:47.352 --> 32:49.843
It's quite pleased and pleasant to...

32:51.089 --> 32:53.683
I've heard a lot about you both.

32:53.758 --> 32:56.090
- Have you?
- Yeah.

32:58.230 --> 33:01.927
- So what are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.128
- No way. You're just... That's just...
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

33:05.203 --> 33:07.694
- You can't... Here?
- It's true.

33:07.772 --> 33:12.539
You mean your normal business itinerary
does not include Fraziers Bottom?

33:12.611 --> 33:14.340
No.

33:15.213 --> 33:17.681
oK, Cathy.

33:17.749 --> 33:20.650
- Am I too late to take you to lunch?
- No.

33:21.520 --> 33:24.819
- Great. Shall we?
- Yeah.

33:24.890 --> 33:27.358
- If that's oK, Pete.
- Well, actually...

33:27.425 --> 33:29.689
- If that's oK.
- It's oK.

33:29.761 --> 33:32.696
If you're going back
to the airport I'll ride with you.

33:32.764 --> 33:35.790
By the route 73 cloverleaf,
I'll have given myself to you

33:35.867 --> 33:38.495
in ways you have only
read about in the drugstore.

33:41.406 --> 33:44.534
- It was great to meet you.
- You, too.

33:47.612 --> 33:50.342
Was there something
that you wanted to tell me?

33:51.416 --> 33:53.407
It was nothing.

33:53.485 --> 33:55.476
oK.

34:10.601 --> 34:12.592
- Wow. Nice car.
- Thanks.

34:12.670 --> 34:16.664
I asked the manager for a rental convertible
and he gave me his wife's car.

34:17.909 --> 34:19.239
Really?

34:19.311 --> 34:22.643
And that was the last time
we ever saw her.

34:24.616 --> 34:27.641
Cathy, he's not her type.

34:27.719 --> 34:33.157
No. Rich, famous, handsome,
ass like cement.

34:33.224 --> 34:35.715
You are absolutely right.

34:40.264 --> 34:44.668
- [cook] Move these cheeseburgers.
- [waitress] Here you go, sweetpea.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.728
oh, my gosh.

34:47.806 --> 34:50.103
- Here you go, Rosie.
- Thanks.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.166
Thank you.

34:58.984 --> 35:01.475
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.717
I still can't believe you're here.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.815
It was something I had to do.

35:07.892 --> 35:12.329
Sure. Fly clear across the country to
have lunch at the Fraziers Bottom Diner.

35:12.397 --> 35:15.161
I couldn't let that night
be the last time I saw you.

35:15.233 --> 35:17.667
Can I just stop you
and remind you of one thing?

35:17.736 --> 35:20.398
- What's that?
- I'm nobody.

35:20.472 --> 35:23.168
Rosalee, nobody is nobody.

35:24.342 --> 35:27.334
- Fine.
- I'm following my gut.

35:28.947 --> 35:32.940
Sometimes you have to do that,
even if what you're doing seems crazy.

35:33.018 --> 35:38.786
Because in the gap between
what prudence says we should do

35:38.857 --> 35:45.854
and what our heart tells us we must do,
well, Rosie, therein lies our humanity.

35:48.533 --> 35:51.024
That's from The Road to El Dorado.

35:53.672 --> 35:57.608
You really are a big fan, aren't you?

35:57.676 --> 36:01.009
Is that how you get women?
You steal lines from your own movies?

36:01.079 --> 36:03.445
Not anymore. Wow.

36:03.515 --> 36:06.484
I hope not. That would
shoot a hole in your credibility.

36:06.551 --> 36:12.387
Rosie, the truth is
that when we went on our date

36:12.457 --> 36:14.857
you said something
that resonated with me.

36:14.926 --> 36:18.555
You said you were sure
I had my priorities straight.

36:18.630 --> 36:24.466
But here's the thing.
I don't. I really don't.

36:24.536 --> 36:28.233
My entire life has been about
becoming successful, famous,

36:28.306 --> 36:31.469
becoming this thing that I am.

36:31.543 --> 36:34.068
And you were right,
it really is unsatisfying.

36:34.145 --> 36:38.809
I need a positive influence, somebody
with solid and substantial qualities,

36:38.883 --> 36:40.976
somebody who seems to understand life

36:41.052 --> 36:43.680
and how to live it
in a good and happy way, like you.

36:44.222 --> 36:46.213
I just want to be around you.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.021
I want some of that goodness
to rub off on me.

36:52.197 --> 36:54.859
Do you mean goodness
in a romantic way?

36:54.933 --> 36:58.164
No, a platonic goodness.
And I mean that very seriously.

36:58.236 --> 37:00.227
No funny business here.

37:01.740 --> 37:07.372
- Did I say something wrong?
- No. No, no, no. No.

37:08.446 --> 37:12.041
So, are you going to be
in Fraziers Bottom for a while, then?

37:12.117 --> 37:17.555
I think I have to. If I'm going to reset
my priorities, I got to get out of LA.

37:17.622 --> 37:19.613
I got to get out of that fishbowl.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.323
So, what do you say?

37:32.070 --> 37:34.561
I say, yikes-a-bee.

37:36.007 --> 37:38.066
What does that mean?

37:38.143 --> 37:41.306
It's just something my dad and I say
when life surprises you

37:41.379 --> 37:43.370
and there's nowhere to go but forward.

37:45.450 --> 37:48.442
- Is that like "yes"?
- Yes.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.817
Yes.

37:56.094 --> 37:58.085
Thanks for lunch.

38:00.198 --> 38:02.826
- I'll see you at seven, then.
- See you at seven.

38:02.901 --> 38:05.062
- oK.
- oK.

38:26.524 --> 38:29.254
Stop. Seriously.

38:29.327 --> 38:32.057
You go, girl. You get your man.

38:58.997 --> 39:01.363
It's room eight.

39:01.433 --> 39:03.697
Just go down
to the door marked eight.

39:03.769 --> 39:05.964
- All right.
- It's just past seven.

39:06.038 --> 39:09.269
If you hit nine, you've gone too far.

39:09.341 --> 39:11.866
- Got you. No phone calls, please.
- All right.

39:11.944 --> 39:14.777
- Thank you.
- Have a great night.

39:14.847 --> 39:17.145
- You, too.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

39:17.216 --> 39:20.583
- Very good.
- I'm on at 1 1:00.

39:20.652 --> 39:22.643
oK.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.546
Huh.

40:08.166 --> 40:13.194
He wants your goodness
to rub off on him.

40:13.272 --> 40:16.605
- I know, right?
- I see.

40:16.675 --> 40:20.873
And you actually believe this?

40:20.946 --> 40:23.176
- Why wouldn't I?
- Wow, Rosie.

40:23.248 --> 40:27.446
There's innocent, there's childlike,
and then there's just asking for it.

40:27.519 --> 40:29.749
He wants your goodness
to rub off on him?

40:29.821 --> 40:32.722
He wants your ass
to rub off on him is more like it.

40:32.791 --> 40:34.850
- oh, my God.
- Yeah. Whatever.

40:34.927 --> 40:38.795
- You can't go out with him tonight.
- What do you mean I can't?

40:38.864 --> 40:43.028
I mean that I need you
to stay for the late shift.

40:43.101 --> 40:46.127
Janine's sick.
Yeah, she's got a cough.

40:46.204 --> 40:51.335
- She does not.
- No, not yet, but she will.

40:51.410 --> 40:54.311
She's definitely coming down
with something.

40:54.379 --> 40:55.812
No, she's not.

40:57.282 --> 40:59.910
Janine, cough for me. Cough for me.

41:01.053 --> 41:03.578
- See? God, it's all in your lungs.
- What is?

41:03.655 --> 41:05.646
- Nothing. You're fine.
- No, you're not.

41:05.724 --> 41:08.158
Do not tell my employees
when they are fine.

41:08.226 --> 41:10.251
She's fine.

41:10.329 --> 41:13.230
Even if she weren't,
you'd have to find somebody else

41:13.298 --> 41:15.892
because I am going out
with Tad Hamilton.

41:20.372 --> 41:23.671
- Stop that.
- I did feel something in my lungs.

41:23.742 --> 41:28.179
You're not getting off tonight, Janine.
Bob, not now.

41:30.682 --> 41:33.583
- [receptionist] Everywhere Inn.
- Yeah.

41:33.652 --> 41:37.110
Do you guys have any other rooms?
or how about suites?

41:37.189 --> 41:40.955
Well, yeah, we got sweets.
We got some lollies here by the register

41:41.126 --> 41:44.357
if you want to come on by
and get yourself a lolly.

41:44.429 --> 41:48.490
No, I mean maybe something
a little bigger or newer?

41:48.567 --> 41:51.900
- Bigger and newer?
- Yes, I understand what you mean.

41:51.970 --> 41:54.438
And no, we don't have suites like that.

41:54.506 --> 41:58.465
oK, I guess that's cool.
That's cool, I guess.

41:59.611 --> 42:01.875
- Can you hold on a second?
- Yes, sir.

42:05.017 --> 42:08.282
- Hello.
- Hi, big guy. Where are you?

42:08.353 --> 42:11.151
I'm at a motel in Fraziers Bottom,
West Virginia.

42:11.223 --> 42:14.522
oK. Words I never heard anyone utter.

42:14.593 --> 42:16.891
- She's special, Richard.
- Who?

42:16.962 --> 42:20.728
- The girl from the charity thing.
- The Win-A-Date girl?

42:20.799 --> 42:24.997
You flew to a place actually called
Fraziers Bottom, West Virginia,

42:25.070 --> 42:28.403
and are staying in a motel
in order to nail the Win-A-Date girl?

42:28.473 --> 42:30.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:30.175 --> 42:33.338
I don't want to nail her.
Please don't put it in those terms.

42:33.412 --> 42:35.880
Oh, forgive me, Lord Byron.

42:35.947 --> 42:38.472
I want to be around her, you know?

42:38.550 --> 42:41.644
She has a goodness.
There's a lot that I can learn from her.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.915
I'm trying to feed my soul, oK?

42:43.989 --> 42:47.720
- I'm trying to find a way to be happy.
- You want to be happy now?

42:47.793 --> 42:49.920
- This is big for me, Richard.
- oh, God.

42:49.995 --> 42:53.089
- This is a turning point for me.
- You think that today.

42:53.165 --> 42:56.999
But by the end of the week,
when you've nailed her,

42:57.069 --> 43:00.129
you're going to feel differently.

43:00.205 --> 43:02.605
And what do you suppose happens then?

43:02.674 --> 43:06.075
- I don't...
- I will tell you what happens then.

43:06.144 --> 43:10.740
You pulverize her heart,
and then the press finds out

43:10.816 --> 43:14.775
and all the good that was done
by the promotion gets washed away.

43:14.853 --> 43:17.617
And Jimmy Ing continues breathing.

43:17.689 --> 43:21.181
People like you can't have
relationships with girls from Montana.

43:21.259 --> 43:23.090
- West Virginia.
- Whatever.

43:23.161 --> 43:25.061
- Why not?
- You're too different.

43:25.130 --> 43:27.121
Your values are different.

43:27.199 --> 43:31.431
- For example, she has them.
- No, this can work.

43:31.503 --> 43:34.267
It can't and when it ends,
it's very bad for business.

43:34.339 --> 43:37.069
There are more important things
than business.

43:38.577 --> 43:41.944
I don't even know who I'm talking
to now. Hello? Is this Tad?

43:42.013 --> 43:44.413
- What have you done with Tad?
- I got to go, oK?

43:44.483 --> 43:49.921
No, you do not got to go. You're going
through some kind of a phase.

43:49.988 --> 43:54.049
An extreme version of your normal
in-between-jobs insanity.

43:54.126 --> 43:57.425
And it has a hold of you.
You need to come back to LA,

43:57.496 --> 44:00.260
have a Bushmills and a Percocet,
go out with an actress

44:00.332 --> 44:04.063
looking to advance her career and
end this self-destructive behavior.

44:04.136 --> 44:07.970
- I'll talk to you soon.
- No, Tad. Bad Tad.

44:08.039 --> 44:10.530
- Bye, Richard.
- Don't hang up on me.

44:14.513 --> 44:16.378
owww!

44:18.150 --> 44:21.244
- Hello?
- Yes, Mr. Hamilton. I am here, sir.

44:21.319 --> 44:23.913
You wouldn't happen to have
a masseuse on staff?

44:23.989 --> 44:28.016
No, but I am a very fast learner,

44:28.093 --> 44:31.790
and I could, you know... Hello?

45:35.260 --> 45:37.251
Coming.

45:40.765 --> 45:43.233
You must be Tad.

45:43.301 --> 45:45.826
Must be. You are Tad.
I know what you look like.

45:45.904 --> 45:48.805
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Futch.
- Henry, for God's sake.

45:48.873 --> 45:51.103
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

45:51.176 --> 45:55.670
- Rosie'll be down in a minute.
- oK, great.

45:55.747 --> 45:58.477
May I offer you a chocolate martini?

46:00.352 --> 46:03.788
- Wow, look at that.
- I hear they're very big out your way.

46:03.855 --> 46:06.085
Yeah? Yeah, I guess they are.

46:07.359 --> 46:09.623
I'm driving, so...

46:09.694 --> 46:11.958
Attaboy.

46:14.332 --> 46:16.323
[Mr. Futch] Have a seat.

46:23.975 --> 46:27.570
So, it looks like
Emperor's New Clothes

46:27.646 --> 46:30.171
will top $1 00 mill in domestic Bo.

46:32.584 --> 46:33.573
Yeah.

46:33.652 --> 46:37.520
And Quantum Studios, I think
they're looking to vertically integrate,

46:37.589 --> 46:40.251
either by buying a web or a weblet.

46:41.126 --> 46:43.458
Could be.

46:43.528 --> 46:45.519
Yes. Yeah.

46:52.871 --> 46:55.305
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:55.373 --> 46:59.400
- I see you've met Dad.
- Yeah. We've been talking shop.

46:59.477 --> 47:01.502
So what do you want to do tonight?

47:01.579 --> 47:05.242
- Do you guys have a movie theater?
- The Warner.

47:05.317 --> 47:08.684
It's part of
the Loews family of theaters.

47:08.753 --> 47:12.280
- Have you seen King Arthur of Britain?
- I've been wanting to.

47:12.357 --> 47:14.348
You two enjoy yourselves.

47:14.426 --> 47:17.623
Have her back by dawn.
And no cocaine.

47:17.696 --> 47:19.288
No, sir.

47:24.602 --> 47:27.093
- How was I?
- You were great, Daddy.

47:30.041 --> 47:32.032
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.

47:33.044 --> 47:36.343
- I'm telling you, that's him.
- oh, yeah.

47:36.414 --> 47:38.848
- Mom, I swear it's him.
- You think so?

47:38.917 --> 47:40.908
Yes, it's Tad Hamilton.

47:40.985 --> 47:42.976
You look so sad there.

47:45.190 --> 47:48.182
[Tad] Give me a break.
I'd just lost my wife and my goat.

47:50.528 --> 47:54.055
[TV] Next week, on a very special
Paramedic Rescue...

48:04.075 --> 48:06.236
And what were your respective ages?

48:06.311 --> 48:11.977
- I was 1 2 and she was 30.
- Did your mother know?

48:12.050 --> 48:13.517
[man] Yeah.

48:14.919 --> 48:16.944
Hasta el próximo miércoles.

48:17.021 --> 48:19.785
Ahora disponsible en viernes
in super mercado.

48:22.227 --> 48:27.995
[Tad] So, what do people do at this point
in the evening in Fraziers Bottom?

48:28.066 --> 48:30.728
- Well, they go to the diner.
- We could do that.

48:30.802 --> 48:34.431
We haven't eaten anything
in almost, what, 1 5 minutes.

48:34.506 --> 48:38.704
- or they go home.
- It is a school night.

48:38.777 --> 48:43.510
of course, if it were a date,
we might go to the Watergap overlook.

48:44.649 --> 48:47.641
And what do people do there?

48:48.453 --> 48:50.580
They park.

48:51.689 --> 48:54.089
And then?

48:54.159 --> 48:57.959
And then they marvel at what
a feat of engineering the gap is.

48:58.029 --> 49:00.725
But this isn't a date.
We can't do that.

49:00.799 --> 49:02.289
- No.
- No.

49:02.367 --> 49:05.063
I don't want to do anything
to harm the friendship.

49:05.136 --> 49:09.007
Me neither.

49:09.047 --> 49:11.498
over two trillion tons of water

49:12.710 --> 49:15.702
pass through the gap every hour.

49:18.616 --> 49:21.608
That's enough water
to float a battleship.

49:22.854 --> 49:24.947
or put out every fire in West Virginia.

49:25.023 --> 49:26.786
- No kidding.
- Uh-oh.

49:27.926 --> 49:29.894
Excuse me.

49:38.636 --> 49:40.627
Huh.

49:51.516 --> 49:54.849
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Futch. It's Pete.

49:54.919 --> 49:57.547
Hiya, Pete. Rosie's not here.

49:57.622 --> 50:00.648
She's out with Tad Hamilton.

50:00.725 --> 50:03.694
Really? I hadn't...
oK, cool. Good for her, then.

50:03.761 --> 50:06.127
He seems like a very nice guy.

50:06.197 --> 50:10.827
He does. A lovely, lovely guy.

50:10.902 --> 50:13.200
So, like, where did they go?

50:13.271 --> 50:16.172
- The movies.
- The movies. oK.

50:16.241 --> 50:20.871
It looks like the seven o'clock
would get out at 8.45, 8.50...

50:22.547 --> 50:28.315
or so someone happened
to just mention to me in passing.

50:28.386 --> 50:31.321
So I guess that would
put them out and about

50:31.389 --> 50:36.053
and onto their next activity.

50:36.127 --> 50:40.063
I guess it would, Pete.
I'll leave Rosie a note that you called.

50:40.131 --> 50:42.656
Yeah, I just had
a little inventory question.

50:42.734 --> 50:46.898
A little dairy-case query.

50:46.971 --> 50:49.565
But we can clear that up tomorrow.

50:49.641 --> 50:51.768
oK, Pete. Goodbye.

50:53.011 --> 50:55.002
All right.

50:58.349 --> 51:00.010
Rosie...

51:07.559 --> 51:11.518
Could I see
your driver's license and regis...

51:11.596 --> 51:15.088
- Yikes-a-bee.
- Hello, officer.

51:15.166 --> 51:18.158
- Rosalee?
- Hi, Tom.

51:18.236 --> 51:21.137
Hi. Wow.

51:21.205 --> 51:24.902
- oh, boy.
- oK, then.

51:24.976 --> 51:27.103
We heard you were in town,
Mr. Hamilton.

51:27.178 --> 51:30.272
- Did you?
- Pretty fond of our Rosalee there, huh?

51:30.348 --> 51:32.782
Yes. Yes, I am, officer.

51:32.850 --> 51:36.286
- Tom?
- Right, right, listen.

51:36.354 --> 51:39.289
We got a call saying
that there was someone parked here

51:39.357 --> 51:43.589
and you know
it's illegal after sunset, so...

51:43.661 --> 51:45.891
- You got a call at this hour?
- Yeah.

51:45.964 --> 51:47.556
From who, a raccoon?

51:54.939 --> 51:56.600
Never mind.

51:56.674 --> 52:00.337
[Rosie] I am going to kill Pete, bring him
back to life and then kill him again.

52:00.411 --> 52:02.675
[Tad] Calm down. Calm down.

52:02.747 --> 52:06.148
- Why aren't you upset?
- Because it doesn't matter.

52:07.619 --> 52:09.610
oK?

52:11.155 --> 52:16.821
What happened here tonight
was a force of nature.

52:19.230 --> 52:25.829
Two people set out to be friends,
but nature would have none of it.

52:25.903 --> 52:28.565
Nature wanted them to be more.

52:29.641 --> 52:32.439
And nature is going
to want that tomorrow.

52:54.599 --> 52:56.726
What did I tell you?

52:56.801 --> 53:01.864
What did I tell you about your
carnal treasure?

53:01.939 --> 53:04.032
- You said to guard it.
- I said, guard it.

53:04.108 --> 53:07.874
And what did you do?
You practically chucked it at him.

53:07.945 --> 53:11.574
You're acting like it was a sleazy night.
It wasn't. It was classy.

53:11.649 --> 53:15.517
It's not like he took you to the movies
and then felt you up in his car.

53:15.586 --> 53:18.350
The evening evolved, Pete.

53:18.423 --> 53:20.721
My God, did he actually say that?

53:20.792 --> 53:23.317
It started as two friends
going to the movies...

53:23.394 --> 53:26.022
- And it evolved into dry humping.
- He fought it.

53:26.097 --> 53:29.760
He didn't want to do anything
that might wreck the friendship.

53:31.035 --> 53:36.268
Wow. Did he actually...
I can't believe he used that line.

53:36.340 --> 53:39.935
- And I can't believe you bought it.
- It's not a line.

53:40.011 --> 53:43.947
oK, fellas, a show of hands.
Who here has used some form

53:44.015 --> 53:47.451
of the "don't want to harm
the friendship" line?

53:51.756 --> 53:55.453
- Father Newell?
- Well, prior to my enfrockment.

53:56.861 --> 54:00.627
Rosie, what are Tad's pectorals
like to the touch?

54:00.698 --> 54:02.689
Are they warm yet firm like...

54:02.767 --> 54:05.998
- Cath, that's really not helping now.
- Sorry, got caught up.

54:06.070 --> 54:08.561
Thanks. Listen, Rosie, just...

54:11.876 --> 54:14.003
Listen to me, bottom line.

54:14.078 --> 54:18.071
Tad Hamilton is an actor, ok?

54:20.051 --> 54:23.384
How do you know
that he's not acting with you?

54:24.989 --> 54:27.685
- He's not acting.
- No.

54:27.759 --> 54:30.284
He is. He's playing a role.

54:30.361 --> 54:33.853
The role of Hollywood bad boy
trying to find virtue.

54:35.433 --> 54:37.924
oK, after you guys have...

54:40.104 --> 54:43.096
After you guys have been
together a couple of times

54:45.076 --> 54:47.738
he's out of here, ok?

54:48.646 --> 54:52.082
You will never see him again.

54:53.684 --> 54:56.619
Hey, Rosie, guess what?
I bought a house.

54:56.687 --> 55:00.987
I bought a house.
Can you believe it? Can you believe it?

55:01.058 --> 55:05.461
It's actually a farm with a house
and a silo for my wheat.

55:05.530 --> 55:08.966
- Really? You bought a house.
- I bought a house.

55:09.033 --> 55:11.797
We're putting down roots, baby.

55:12.837 --> 55:14.998
- What do you think of that?
- It's good.

55:15.072 --> 55:17.131
Come see it. Maybe after work?

55:17.208 --> 55:19.438
- I'd love to.
- Yeah, I'd love to.

55:23.548 --> 55:25.539
Great.

55:46.938 --> 55:49.964
[Rosie] He's going to stay in the motel
while he fixes up the farm.

55:50.041 --> 55:53.807
- He's a farmer all of a sudden?
- [Rosie] I think he'll be a good farmer.

55:53.878 --> 55:55.937
[Pete] He's from Malibu, California.

55:56.013 --> 55:58.777
The only thing they grow there
are breasts.

55:58.850 --> 56:00.841
[Rosie] Could you smile a little bit?

56:00.918 --> 56:03.443
- This means nothing.
- You are unbelievable.

56:03.521 --> 56:07.855
What? Rosie, people like this
buy houses all the time.

56:07.925 --> 56:10.393
- It's called a tax shelter.
- Peter.

56:10.461 --> 56:13.453
I can guarantee you
that by the end of today

56:13.531 --> 56:16.295
Tad's farm and his house

56:17.301 --> 56:21.067
and his fricking wheat
will be right back on the market.

56:21.138 --> 56:23.663
Why? What are you going to do?

56:23.741 --> 56:27.404
Nothing. You know,
just be a good neighbor.

56:34.085 --> 56:35.416
Howdy.

56:35.486 --> 56:39.183
- Tad, this place is unbelievable.
- Thanks, little lady.

56:42.159 --> 56:45.993
This barn sits on what they call
"the south 40."

56:46.063 --> 56:50.500
Yeah. I'm not sure exactly
how many acres that is, but

56:50.568 --> 56:52.160
I'm going to guess that's a lot.

56:53.638 --> 56:56.801
I'm going to guess 40.

56:56.874 --> 56:59.843
oh, yeah. Could be.

56:59.911 --> 57:03.278
Tad, being a new farm owner and all,

57:03.347 --> 57:07.374
I know you'll probably get some people
to run this place for you, but...

57:07.451 --> 57:10.784
hell, I'd be happy to show you
a couple of everyday farm chores.

57:10.855 --> 57:14.120
Really? Pete, that would be great.
Thank you.

57:14.191 --> 57:17.183
Tad, that's not a problem.

57:18.930 --> 57:22.923
What you're going to do here
is grab on to one of the...

57:24.635 --> 57:26.626
essentially one of the nipples,

57:26.704 --> 57:29.935
and just pull it firmly but gently
towards the pail.

57:30.007 --> 57:32.942
You're going to freak out a...

57:33.711 --> 57:38.774
[Tad] Mmm, look at all that creamy milk.
That a girl, Arleen. That a girl.

57:38.849 --> 57:42.876
- You are making old Tad thirsty.
- [Pete] Where'd you learn to do that?

57:42.954 --> 57:46.151
Pete, you remember my remake
of The Grapes of Wrath?

57:52.396 --> 57:56.127
[Pete] oK, so, the trick is
to take a full swing

57:56.200 --> 57:59.636
so as to split the log in one swift...

58:02.206 --> 58:04.504
stroke.

58:05.276 --> 58:07.369
oK.

58:07.445 --> 58:11.176
Yeah. Let's do this.

58:11.716 --> 58:14.549
So, you work out?

58:15.186 --> 58:17.279
- No.
- [Pete] Yeah, me neither.

58:17.355 --> 58:19.346
I know, it's like... Me neither.

58:19.423 --> 58:24.690
oK. It's just basically
one swift stroke.

58:26.797 --> 58:31.166
oK. And sometimes, basically,
you get a bad piece of wood. Basically.

58:32.103 --> 58:34.469
And sometimes you don't.

58:34.538 --> 58:38.030
[Pete] That's good. Beginner's luck.
First time's the charm.

58:41.679 --> 58:45.080
And the luck continues.
That's great for you, man.

58:45.149 --> 58:48.448
Did you ever see a movie I did called
A Man Named Jackson?

58:48.519 --> 58:51.955
If it came out, Tad,

58:52.023 --> 58:54.583
then I saw it.

58:55.760 --> 58:59.093
I think the ax is actually broken.

58:59.163 --> 59:01.154
You got it. Good.

59:11.150 --> 59:13.482
[Tad] Get someone else to cry,
because I don't cry.

59:13.553 --> 59:14.577
[girl laughing]

59:14.654 --> 59:15.951
I don't do that.

59:21.494 --> 59:24.395
Which is why I try to stay away
from melodramas.

59:26.833 --> 59:29.233
oh, my God. I finally did it.

59:29.302 --> 59:31.998
People, are you watching this? Rosie.

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:19.074
- Pete.
- Hey, Tad.

01:00:19.152 --> 01:00:21.416
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

01:00:22.155 --> 01:00:24.715
Yeah, sure.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:30.092
- Forgive the intrusion, but...
- No, no. Please, fire away.

01:00:30.163 --> 01:00:32.825
oK. Here it is.

01:00:38.538 --> 01:00:42.304
You win, oK?
Fair and square.

01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:46.073
- You win.
- Thank you.

01:00:46.145 --> 01:00:49.706
You did have an advantage
or two going in, but...

01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:54.916
Excuse me, we're in the middle
of something here.

01:00:54.987 --> 01:00:57.387
Yeah, no problem.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.061
I want Rosie to be happy.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:07.964
So, I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

01:01:09.235 --> 01:01:12.602
Do you know how long she keeps her hair
in straight or in curly mode?

01:01:12.672 --> 01:01:14.367
What?

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.238
or why her favorite necklace
has a starfish clasp?

01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:18.368
No.

01:01:18.444 --> 01:01:22.278
Do you even know
that she has six different smiles?

01:01:22.348 --> 01:01:24.407
- She has six smiles?
- Yeah.

01:01:24.483 --> 01:01:26.883
one when something
flat out makes her laugh.

01:01:26.953 --> 01:01:29.285
one when she's laughing
out of politeness.

01:01:29.355 --> 01:01:31.482
But there's one when she makes plans.

01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:33.957
one when she makes fun of herself.

01:01:34.026 --> 01:01:37.621
one when she's uncomfortable.
And one when...

01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:43.029
one when she's talking
about her friends.

01:01:45.338 --> 01:01:48.432
- I don't know those things yet, Pete.
- No, you don't, Tad.

01:01:48.507 --> 01:01:50.737
I'm telling you, she is more of...

01:01:52.478 --> 01:01:56.278
a treasure than you can possibly know.

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:59.318
She's not just some
wholesome small-town girl,

01:01:59.385 --> 01:02:01.945
some good-for-you breath of fresh air.

01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:05.252
Tad, she is a wonderful person
with a huge heart.

01:02:05.324 --> 01:02:06.313
Yeah.

01:02:06.392 --> 01:02:10.192
And the kind of beauty that a guy
only sees once, you know? once.

01:02:13.099 --> 01:02:19.004
Listen, Tad, if there is even a chance
that you could break her heart,

01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:23.001
please, just, for her sake...

01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:27.306
walk away, man.

01:02:28.314 --> 01:02:31.613
I could never break Rosalee's heart. oK?

01:02:31.684 --> 01:02:34.050
Good. Because if you do, I swear to God,

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.089
I will tear you to pieces
with my bare hands.

01:02:37.156 --> 01:02:40.319
or vicious rhetoric.

01:02:46.098 --> 01:02:48.225
You're a good guy, Pete.

01:02:48.968 --> 01:02:53.462
But it's apparently not good enough.

01:03:06.185 --> 01:03:08.415
- Do you mind if I...
- Yeah, no. My bad.

01:03:08.487 --> 01:03:10.978
Finish up in here. I'm sorry.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.791
You're a good kisser.

01:03:23.937 --> 01:03:27.998
But I guess it doesn't come
as a shock to you to hear that.

01:03:28.074 --> 01:03:30.872
You're a really good kisser.

01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:34.175
- Even compared to Hollywood girls?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:36.149 --> 01:03:38.640
That's just ridiculous.

01:03:46.392 --> 01:03:48.189
Oh, Tad Hamilton.

01:03:48.261 --> 01:03:50.388
Your favorite people are here.

01:03:50.463 --> 01:03:52.055
- You got to be kidding me.
- Who is it?

01:03:52.131 --> 01:03:54.827
- Guess who?
- It's my agent and my manager.

01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:57.927
Taddy? Tadala.

01:03:58.004 --> 01:04:01.963
- This is a nightmare.
- Housekeeping.

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.601
Let us in.

01:04:04.677 --> 01:04:07.475
- Hey, Tad.
- I'd like to apologize for...

01:04:07.547 --> 01:04:09.538
Open zee zleibenshlocken.

01:04:09.616 --> 01:04:12.881
Come on.
You're not going to be Punk'd.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:18.356
- Fellas.
- Tad Edward Hamilton.

01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:24.429
- Howdy, little lady.
- Hi.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.827
My manager, Richard Levy
and my agent, Richard Levy.

01:04:31.904 --> 01:04:33.997
You're both named Richard Levy?

01:04:34.073 --> 01:04:36.064
Who isn't?

01:04:39.078 --> 01:04:41.137
You.

01:04:41.214 --> 01:04:44.445
- You must be Rosalee.
- Yes.

01:04:44.517 --> 01:04:46.644
- Did we come at a bad time?
- I hope so.

01:04:46.719 --> 01:04:48.949
Actually, yes.

01:04:49.022 --> 01:04:53.118
Well, Tad.
Jimmy Ing stopped breathing.

01:04:54.327 --> 01:04:56.420
- What?
- You got the part, pal.

01:04:56.496 --> 01:05:00.432
Seems he saw something that
reminded him that he had to have you.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.869
- It was the body of your work.
- I knew it.

01:05:04.937 --> 01:05:08.429
Your credits.
The reality of you and who you are.

01:05:08.508 --> 01:05:10.738
He called me and said,
"Who am I kidding?

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:12.801
"Tad Hamilton has to play this part."

01:05:12.879 --> 01:05:15.211
There's nobody else.

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:20.745
Fellas, I have never felt better
than I do at this moment.

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.913
Except for that weekend in Cabo.

01:05:22.989 --> 01:05:27.016
[Tad] That is exactly
what I am talking about.

01:05:28.161 --> 01:05:30.925
Easy, I've got a bad back.

01:05:30.997 --> 01:05:33.864
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

01:05:34.834 --> 01:05:39.168
I told you a little good career news
would put your head back on straight.

01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:45.070
- So then you're leaving?
- Yes.

01:05:45.144 --> 01:05:47.476
Fittings Monday and rehearsals Tuesday.

01:05:47.547 --> 01:05:51.506
You're back on the beam, pally.

01:05:51.584 --> 01:05:53.984
Boy, things happen fast.

01:06:01.894 --> 01:06:03.885
oh, my God.

01:06:03.963 --> 01:06:06.932
- You're right.
- No, it's fine.

01:06:06.999 --> 01:06:09.433
- I'm going to turn it down.
- What?

01:06:09.502 --> 01:06:10.764
- What?
- You are?

01:06:10.837 --> 01:06:13.101
I came here vowing
to change my priorities

01:06:13.172 --> 01:06:17.233
and at the first opportunity
I'm abandoning that.

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:20.575
You're not going to turn down the part.
We both know that.

01:06:23.483 --> 01:06:27.419
- Give us a minute, will you, fellas?
- We'll be in the lobby.

01:06:30.356 --> 01:06:33.018
I wonder if they have
a masseuse on staff.

01:06:45.071 --> 01:06:47.904
- I want you to go with me.
- What?

01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:52.509
- What?
- She absolutely cannot go with him.

01:06:52.578 --> 01:06:54.739
I won't take the part
unless you come me.

01:06:54.814 --> 01:06:56.805
Although we could work something out.

01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:59.750
- Really?
- Yes, really.

01:06:59.819 --> 01:07:04.017
Rosie, have you been listening
to anything I've been telling you?

01:07:05.558 --> 01:07:07.890
I love you.

01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:12.554
How many times in your life
have you said that?

01:07:16.903 --> 01:07:20.703
- Not counting the movies?
- Not counting.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.901
I've said it a few times.

01:07:27.647 --> 01:07:29.638
But...

01:07:30.416 --> 01:07:33.408
But I never knew what it meant.

01:07:38.424 --> 01:07:40.415
I can't go with you, Tad.

01:07:41.994 --> 01:07:44.224
Because you don't love me.

01:07:45.932 --> 01:07:48.332
You maybe want to love me,

01:07:48.401 --> 01:07:51.962
but I think what you love right now
is the idea of me.

01:07:52.805 --> 01:07:55.968
You can't love someone
for what they stand for or seem to be.

01:07:56.042 --> 01:07:58.169
You have to love them for their details,

01:07:58.244 --> 01:08:00.940
for the things that are
true of them and only them.

01:08:01.013 --> 01:08:03.982
- I do love you for your details, Rosie.
- You don't.

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:08.043
You couldn't possibly.
You don't even know what they are.

01:08:17.497 --> 01:08:21.456
- You have six smiles.
- What?

01:08:22.935 --> 01:08:26.200
You have six smiles.
Did you know that?

01:08:27.372 --> 01:08:30.671
one when something
really makes you laugh.

01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:35.372
And one when you're just
laughing out of politeness.

01:08:36.314 --> 01:08:38.340
one when you're making plans

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:41.818
and one when
you're making fun of yourself.

01:08:41.888 --> 01:08:45.483
one when you're uncomfortable
and one when...

01:08:47.993 --> 01:08:51.157
one when you're talking
about your friends.

01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:54.393
- How many is that?
- Like 50.

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:59.069
I told you. I told you.

01:09:01.207 --> 01:09:04.665
That is so much better
than any speech from any of your movies.

01:09:04.743 --> 01:09:07.076
I had a better writer.

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:11.640
So...

01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:15.243
Will you go?

01:09:25.598 --> 01:09:27.589
Yes.

01:09:29.769 --> 01:09:33.068
He's going back to Cali,
to Cali, to Cali.

01:09:36.242 --> 01:09:40.109
- [Tad] What are you thinking?
- Nothing. I'm done thinking.

01:09:40.179 --> 01:09:43.011
If I'm making a huge mistake,
I don't want to know.

01:09:43.082 --> 01:09:45.380
You're not making a mistake.

01:09:55.962 --> 01:09:58.430
You know, as a bartender

01:09:58.497 --> 01:10:03.799
you do learn to kind of recognize
those customers who need to talk.

01:10:04.737 --> 01:10:06.932
Angelica, I'm fine.

01:10:07.006 --> 01:10:10.498
But could I have, like, six more of these?

01:10:10.576 --> 01:10:14.979
No, Pete. You really need to talk.

01:10:16.916 --> 01:10:18.907
oK.

01:10:20.753 --> 01:10:24.416
I think that our friend Rosie...

01:10:25.558 --> 01:10:28.550
might be falling in love
with Tad Hamilton.

01:10:28.628 --> 01:10:32.291
Yeah, didn't have to be a bartender
to see that one coming.

01:10:32.365 --> 01:10:35.926
Right, but the problem with that is...

01:10:39.071 --> 01:10:41.733
that I'm in love with Rosie.

01:10:43.876 --> 01:10:48.643
You know, I always thought
that maybe you were.

01:10:56.989 --> 01:10:58.980
So how much do you love her?

01:11:00.893 --> 01:11:05.728
Is it love, is it big love
or is it great love?

01:11:05.798 --> 01:11:08.426
What do you mean?

01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:10.696
Love you get over in two months.

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:12.761
Big love, two years.

01:11:13.973 --> 01:11:15.304
And great love...

01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:21.275
- Yeah?
- Great love changes your life.

01:11:29.088 --> 01:11:31.079
oh, my God.

01:11:31.857 --> 01:11:33.848
It's great love.

01:11:39.365 --> 01:11:41.390
Isn't that great?

01:11:42.201 --> 01:11:44.396
You got to win her back.

01:11:45.571 --> 01:11:51.806
Angelica, trust me,
I have tried everything.

01:11:51.877 --> 01:11:54.812
What did she say
when you told her that you love her?

01:11:58.384 --> 01:12:03.720
Well, actually,
maybe not everything, but...

01:12:03.789 --> 01:12:06.815
What did she say when you kissed her?

01:12:06.892 --> 01:12:10.521
oK, maybe it's more like
two things I haven't tried.

01:12:10.596 --> 01:12:13.463
Well, what have you tried?

01:12:13.532 --> 01:12:19.095
I have very unsubtly
implied how I feel about her.

01:12:20.106 --> 01:12:22.631
- oK, get up.
- What?

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:25.040
- Get your ass off the barstool.
- Angelica.

01:12:25.111 --> 01:12:30.174
Hey, if you feel it and you don't do
everything in your power to reach for it

01:12:30.249 --> 01:12:32.877
you are basically
slapping life in the face.

01:12:32.952 --> 01:12:39.084
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't stand a chance here, oK?

01:12:40.226 --> 01:12:44.128
As my father told me when I said
I'd never get that job in a bar:

01:12:44.196 --> 01:12:49.065
"Honey, your odds go up
when you file an application."

01:12:49.135 --> 01:12:52.798
Sure, but I'm up against...

01:12:54.206 --> 01:12:56.606
Tad Hamilton.

01:12:59.478 --> 01:13:01.469
You are Tad Hamilton.

01:13:03.048 --> 01:13:05.209
- What?
- Don't you see?

01:13:05.284 --> 01:13:08.447
Everybody's Tad Hamilton
to somebody, Pete.

01:13:08.521 --> 01:13:11.615
Rosalee's Tad Hamilton to you.

01:13:12.658 --> 01:13:14.888
And you're Tad Hamilton to me.

01:13:18.697 --> 01:13:20.927
Angelica, thank you.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.059
So start acting like it.

01:13:23.135 --> 01:13:25.330
oK.

01:13:26.839 --> 01:13:28.670
Yeah, oK.

01:13:30.209 --> 01:13:32.609
You are a really good bartender.

01:13:46.158 --> 01:13:47.989
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.051
Come in, come in.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.791
I have something to talk to you about.

01:13:56.869 --> 01:13:58.860
- Me, too.
- Really? You go first.

01:13:58.938 --> 01:14:00.769
- No, you go first.
- No.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.105
- Seriously, you go first.
- oK.

01:14:04.176 --> 01:14:06.235
Tad got a part in this huge movie

01:14:06.312 --> 01:14:09.577
and he asked me to go with him
to California for the shoot.

01:14:09.648 --> 01:14:13.140
We leave tomorrow afternoon.
Isn't that great?

01:14:14.954 --> 01:14:16.819
I probably should've gone first.

01:14:16.889 --> 01:14:20.689
Why? What were you going to say?

01:14:22.461 --> 01:14:25.453
It's nothing. It was nothing.

01:14:25.531 --> 01:14:29.297
Just, you know, travel safely, oK?

01:14:29.368 --> 01:14:31.859
And just really enjoy the shoot.

01:14:36.475 --> 01:14:39.205
Actually, no, I remember
what I was going to say.

01:14:50.856 --> 01:14:52.847
I love you, Rosie.

01:14:54.193 --> 01:14:56.684
I always have.

01:14:56.762 --> 01:15:00.459
If I've been a jerk this last week,
it's because I have been fighting.

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.495
I have been fighting for you.

01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:08.835
I don't want to lose you
to Tad Hamilton or anyone else.

01:15:13.679 --> 01:15:15.670
You're the one.

01:15:22.588 --> 01:15:26.115
So, any reaction to any of this?

01:15:26.191 --> 01:15:29.922
Because now would be an excellent time.

01:15:33.899 --> 01:15:37.391
Now? You kiss me now?

01:15:38.704 --> 01:15:43.937
You say this to me now,
after 22 years of being my friend?

01:15:46.111 --> 01:15:49.877
Yes, to all questions.

01:15:53.419 --> 01:15:55.410
I'm...

01:15:58.257 --> 01:16:00.248
I have to pack.

01:16:03.295 --> 01:16:05.695
You're telling me that you can't answer

01:16:05.764 --> 01:16:08.927
the most important question
I'll ever ask in my entire life

01:16:09.001 --> 01:16:11.367
because you have to pack?

01:16:11.437 --> 01:16:14.838
Not only do I have to pack, but I have
a load of whites in the dryer,

01:16:14.907 --> 01:16:18.070
and my dad called my relatives
from San Clemente

01:16:18.143 --> 01:16:20.475
and they're expecting me, so...

01:16:20.546 --> 01:16:22.537
it's all in the works.

01:16:22.614 --> 01:16:24.605
But this is...

01:16:26.385 --> 01:16:30.412
Rosie, what's in your heart?

01:16:39.732 --> 01:16:41.723
I'm sorry.

01:16:50.609 --> 01:16:52.600
I'm sorry, too.

01:17:08.727 --> 01:17:12.288
- You oK, Pete?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:12.364 --> 01:17:15.925
Listen, Pete, obviously
we've all been a little seduced

01:17:16.001 --> 01:17:18.367
by Tad Hamilton's presence.

01:17:20.205 --> 01:17:23.470
No one more so than me.

01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:28.172
But that doesn't mean I don't know
who cares about my daughter the most

01:17:28.247 --> 01:17:32.240
and who she would be with
if the world were fair.

01:17:35.921 --> 01:17:40.483
- Well, it's not.
- No. No, it's not.

01:17:41.927 --> 01:17:47.365
When I was your age I was completely
in love with Eleanor Hershey.

01:17:50.636 --> 01:17:54.197
of the chocolate Hersheys?

01:17:54.273 --> 01:17:57.504
The Hershey chocolates?

01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:00.938
She was a great girl,
completely unpretentious.

01:18:01.013 --> 01:18:03.948
I actually met her
filling her Cadillac up with gas.

01:18:05.217 --> 01:18:08.550
Anyway, there was this French guy.
He was really rich.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:12.317
He owned, like, France.

01:18:12.391 --> 01:18:14.689
I didn't stand a chance.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.888
It happens that way sometimes.
It shouldn't, but it does.

01:18:17.963 --> 01:18:22.127
Sometimes Goliath
kicks the shit out of David.

01:18:23.135 --> 01:18:26.195
It's just nobody bothers
to tell that story.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.331
Well, thanks, Mr. Futch.

01:18:31.743 --> 01:18:34.143
I feel much better now.

01:18:37.883 --> 01:18:41.910
- Goodbye, Mr. Futch.
- Take it easy, Pete.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.594
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:03.330
No.

01:19:03.404 --> 01:19:06.464
Ever feel more confused or alone?

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:08.532
No.

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:10.771
Have a nice flight.

01:19:35.522 --> 01:19:38.355
[Mr. Futch] So, we'll see you
after principal photography.

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:25.185
Yes, Daddy.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.718
You guys don't mind not flying with us?
We need our privacy.

01:19:28.796 --> 01:19:30.787
- That's fine.
- Yeah.

01:19:30.865 --> 01:19:33.800
We look forward
to our shit-ass commercial flight.

01:19:33.868 --> 01:19:36.393
I always wanted
a layover in Cincinnati.

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:39.031
- We will be absolutely fine.
- Another one in Chicago.

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.098
So we'll be in LA by April?

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.878
We'll be fine.

01:19:47.882 --> 01:19:50.112
- It's time.
- oK.

01:19:50.184 --> 01:19:53.244
- Safe trip, Tad.
- Bye, honey.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:20:00.258
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Hamilton.
- Bye.

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:02.660
- Miss?
- Thank you.

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:10.803
Stop it. Stop it.
What's the matter with you?

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:14.239
Come on.
Commercial isn't so bad.

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.641
There's got to be room for one more.

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:19.111
Will you pull yourself together?

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:21.171
Thank you.

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:23.080
Would you like a Vicodin?

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:08.022
[Tad] Jimmy, being
in your movie is a privilege.

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:12.692
In fact, it's more than a privilege.
It's a real privilege.

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:17.366
Can I... Do you mind if I call you back
in a few minutes?

01:21:18.906 --> 01:21:21.238
oK, thank you, sir.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:35.720
- You oK?
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:39.987
I'm just a little nervous
for some reason.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:44.058
I have a little nervous feeling
in my... self.

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.924
- But that's only natural, right?
- Yeah.

01:21:48.002 --> 01:21:50.835
This is a pretty huge thing I'm doing.

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:53.339
Kind of a great leap of faith.

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:56.400
But I have that faith in you.

01:21:57.612 --> 01:22:00.672
So I'm fine. It's going to be great.

01:22:00.748 --> 01:22:04.775
- Good.
- Can't you tell by my smile?

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:11.314
Which one is it?

01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:15.160
- What?
- What number smile is it?

01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:17.254
It's...

01:22:17.331 --> 01:22:20.391
Wait, it was one.

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:27.700
No, one was when something
really made me laugh.

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:32.074
- Right?
- one and a half.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.527
Rosie...

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:56.934
I didn't know about your six smiles.
Pete told me about them.

01:22:57.004 --> 01:22:59.734
He made me swear
I wasn't going to break your heart,

01:22:59.807 --> 01:23:01.798
or he would tear me to pieces,

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:06.245
either with his bare hands
or his rhetoric.

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:10.710
I stole the speech from Pete
to get you to come here with me.

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:13.549
I lied. And I'm sorry.

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:18.285
And I know you're going to be
very upset. I just...

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:24.391
- Pete told you about the six smiles?
- Yeah.

01:23:24.465 --> 01:23:28.492
And made you swear
that you wouldn't break my heart?

01:23:28.569 --> 01:23:33.438
or he'd tear you to pieces, with either
his bare hands or his rhetoric?

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:35.066
Yeah.

01:23:37.678 --> 01:23:40.841
That is just so...

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.510
adorable.

01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:51.817
What?

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:55.596
Do you think it's possible

01:23:55.663 --> 01:24:00.327
to love someone your whole life
and never really realize it

01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:04.770
until something happens
that makes you see?

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.971
- What's that from?
- No, it's not from anything.

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:11.603
I'm just saying it to you.

01:24:15.416 --> 01:24:17.714
Wow.

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:30.186
Man, what a week.

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:36.427
Fell in love for the first time,
got my heart broken for the first time,

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:39.405
was honorable for the first time.

01:24:39.473 --> 01:24:43.204
Got bit in the ass for being
honorable for the first time.

01:24:43.277 --> 01:24:45.609
Bought a farm.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.376
I'm sorry about the broken-heart part.

01:24:59.026 --> 01:25:02.018
Do you think
you could take me home now?

01:25:03.931 --> 01:25:06.297
Yeah.

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:20.704
Thank you.

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:25.481
- Cathy.
- Rosie?

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:28.681
- Where's Pete?
- He's not here. What are you doing?

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:31.224
What do you mean?
He's always here. He's Pete.

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:33.783
No. He didn't come in today.

01:25:35.863 --> 01:25:38.661
Can I borrow your car?

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:41.099
Yes.

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:43.827
Thank you.

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:58.575
Pete. Pete.

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.653
Not Pete.

01:26:12.466 --> 01:26:14.457
Wow.

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:31.775
I'm just here because Pete
asked me to box up some stuff.

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:36.146
- Why? Where's he going?
- Richmond.

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.655
And he isn't going.

01:26:39.727 --> 01:26:41.718
He's gone.

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:45.127
He's gone to Richmond?

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:47.190
Why?

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:52.331
I cannot believe I am taking
my work home with me.

01:26:56.310 --> 01:27:01.771
When great love is rejected, Rosalee,
something inside a man dies.

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.808
So all he can do is run away,

01:27:04.885 --> 01:27:08.844
where he can meet the girl
he'll love second most.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.060
- Unless...
- Unless what?

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:18.155
Unless you can get to him
before he closes the book on you.

01:27:20.601 --> 01:27:23.934
But once it's closed, it's closed.

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:27.031
It's finished. It's gone, dead.

01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:30.339
It's crushed. It's beaten. It's buried.

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:32.641
It is lost for all of time in a sea...

01:27:32.713 --> 01:27:36.149
- Angelica.
- oK, yeah.

01:27:37.184 --> 01:27:39.175
I owe you.

01:27:41.922 --> 01:27:43.913
Go.

01:28:12.386 --> 01:28:15.753
[announcer] If you've been dumped,
give us a call on late-night talk.

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:18.018
Let's go to line one.
Scott, you're on...

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:32.564
What? Pass me.

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:37.433
Pete. Pete.

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:54.025
- Are you oK?
- Yeah. No...

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:56.086
No, I meant to do that.

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:31.164
You have five smiles, Pete.

01:29:33.934 --> 01:29:37.563
one when you think someone's an idiot.

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:40.630
one when you think
someone's really an idiot.
