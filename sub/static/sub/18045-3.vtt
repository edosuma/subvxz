00:28.696 --> 00:31.114
-I get that they want to be cool.
-It's human nature.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.701
But to get to the pool,
they have to walk in the hot sun.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.703
-It makes them hotter.
-It makes no sense.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.495
It's a giant cascading debacle.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.497
-Belly alert.
-Holy moly.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.501
If the point of the activity
is to cool off by being in water...

00:42.584 --> 00:44.962
-I like where you're going.
-then why not just stay home?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.672
-And take a bath.
-Right?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.465
Eh, the logic's impeccable.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.051
- Oh, my God.
- Just go naked.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.637
Plus, bath water doesn't contain
all those chemicals.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.055
The chlorine, the algaecides.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.766
And the bodily fluids
that shall remain nameless.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.768
-Kid pee.
-I said they'd remain nameless.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.688
Gallons of kid pee
being pumped into this pool as we speak.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.483
-They shouldn't have a drinking fountain.
-All that liquid ends up somewhere.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.110
People don't think.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.402
-Uh-oh. Oh, my God.
-What?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.613
It's Pat.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.252
- All clear.
- This place is a minefield.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.336
- Hi.
- Ah!

01:26.419 --> 01:28.338
It's okay.
It's Andrew, and he's got a shirt on.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.215
-Oh, thank God.
-Welcome back, Rory.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.467
Oh, I'm not back.
I'm just here temporarily.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.052
-That's not what I heard.
-It's true.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.805
At the bookstore, all anyone talks about
is how you're back.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.099
-Well, I'm not back.
-Okay.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.184
Spread the word.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.521
Hey, guys, did you hear?
Somebody vandalized the floaty hut.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.690
-Oh, no.
-Hinges are bent, lock's jammed,

01:46.774 --> 01:49.943
and the kids are having a fit
'cause they can't get their floaties.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.194
Welcome back, by the way.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.738
-Yeah, I'm not back.
-You look back.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.407
Luke donated the money for that hut.
He's gonna be upset.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.868
Forget Luke.
Steve and Kwan are going postal.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.952
There's two of 'em.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.538
When they get mad,
they're like five little Korean people.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.791
They focus all their Korean vitriol
on Lane and me.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.667
-Where are they now?
-The drinking fountain.

02:05.751 --> 02:06.960
They're going back in the pool.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.211
-Yup.
-Figures.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.631
If you see something inflatable,
shout it out.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.258
-She looks back to me.
-Well, she's not back.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.468
It is hot!

02:15.552 --> 02:17.220
I don't know why we come here.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.889
- Welcome back, Rory.
- I'm not back.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.058
- Welcome back, Rory.
- I'm not back.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.351
- Good to have Rory back.
- I know.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.604
It made sense.
I was leaning towards chem.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.439
- I just love chem labs.
- Me, too.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.733
-Beakers, clamps.
-Test-tubes, Bunsen burners.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.236
But I love philosophy, too.
Metaphysics? Can't get enough.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.822
I once got in trouble
for cheating on a metaphysics exam.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.866
I looked into the soul
of the boy next to me.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.035
-You took metaphysics?
-No, that was Woody Allen.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.705
-Woody Allen took metaphysics?
-It's from <i>Annie Hall.</i>

02:42.788 --> 02:45.916
-I only watch German silent films.
-Oh, boy, remember that phase.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.586
-When did you punch a hole in your nose?
-Read the Constitution.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.214
I'm 22.
I get to adorn my body as I see fit.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.591
You're right. You're 22.
Punch all the holes you want.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.176
-Are you gonna join us?
-When I can.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.136
I took some great linguistic courses.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.056
I mean, it's MIT.
Noam Chomsky walks the halls.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.350
I met him.
Chatted with him, laughed with him.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.768
He's my idol.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.145
Well, to Noam is to love him.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.565
Uh, is this thing on?

03:10.648 --> 03:12.400
-Ooh.
-Why're you getting up?

03:12.484 --> 03:13.651
I'm getting extra cheese.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.320
-I'll get it. I'm up.
-I'll get it.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.992
What are you doing this summer
before graduate school?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.952
First, I'm traveling with friends.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.287
We're canvassing a few states
for pot legalization.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.456
-For what?
-It's about civil liberties.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.334
-It happens to be about pot.
-You made it sound way less fun.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.211
-Do you smoke pot?
-No.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.845
- What are we watching?
- Uh, <i>The Returned.</i>

03:39.928 --> 03:41.304
The French <i>Returned?</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:46.309
Blah!

03:46.393 --> 03:47.936
I don't know how long I'll last.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.397
Oh, come on.
Take some NoDoz, drink some coffee.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.565
We've got to break this tragic pattern.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.026
-What pattern?
-Ugh.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.653
We get through one episode,
then half of another,

03:56.737 --> 03:59.281
-then he gets tired and falls asleep.
-I'm up at 5:00.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.366
Then, he won't watch again
till a week later.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.619
At which point, he's forgotten
the first half of the abandoned episode,

04:04.703 --> 04:07.706
and the entire one before that.
Then we have to start all over again.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.624
That puts you
in binge-watching jail, Luke.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.752
I'll get a lawyer.
April, go to law school.

04:11.835 --> 04:12.878
Lawyers are fascists.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.963
Do you remember the first episode
we watched?

04:15.046 --> 04:17.257
It's a bunch of
French people in a small town.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.593
-And some of them are dead.
-Really?

04:20.677 --> 04:21.678
Oh, my God.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.733
Wow. Like a time machine.
Is it weird to be back?

04:35.818 --> 04:37.861
-I'm not back.
-You're not?

04:37.945 --> 04:41.031
Uh, no. I mean, I'm...
I'm here now, but... Never mind.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.617
Oh, hi again.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.619
-So, I totally smoke pot.
-I figured.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.788
Don't tell my dad.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.373
I don't think he'd mind.
Just don't operate a forklift after.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.460
Right. A forklift.
You have an excellent sense of humor.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.754
-Thank you.
-I don't have a great sense of humor.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.630
I'm working on it.
I bought a joke book.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.799
I think that's good.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.551
It's hard to have a sense of humor
in college these days.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.015
-April?
-I never met Noam Chomsky. I made it up.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.725
-Oh.
-I've only smoked pot once.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.186
-I ate so much cheese after.
-That's okay.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.313
I'm still kind of searching.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.191
-Nothing wrong with searching.
-I think I'm having an anxiety attack.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.819
Can I get you something? Water?

05:18.902 --> 05:21.071
-It's just very weird here.
-What do you mean?

05:21.154 --> 05:24.657
-Seeing you back in your childhood room.
-I am not back.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.535
Oh, it's like a postcard
from the real world.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.456
-Maybe we should join Mom and Luke?
-My nose ring hurts.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.376
- Hey, get in here!
- In a minute!

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
Oh, my God. "To Noam is to love him."
I just got that.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.051
April's having a freak out.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.803
-What? April!
-No, it's okay. Rory's got it.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.515
She looks so grown up,
but she is still a kid.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.018
-She wants Rory to take her nose ring out.
-I'll take it out. I hate that thing.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.437
She wants to go to Germany this summer.
Did I tell you?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.106
She does like German cinema.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.858
She's staying
with some exchange students she met.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.236
Hmm.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.530
So where would the money
for Germany come from?

06:03.613 --> 06:05.323
-Me.
-Really?

06:05.407 --> 06:07.159
-Where else?
-She could get a job.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.119
-I could swing it.
-You sure?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.203
Yeah.

06:11.121 --> 06:14.165
She only got a partial scholarship.
You had to make up the difference.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.543
Now, if she's going to grad school,
I mean...

06:17.460 --> 06:20.213
-maybe I could chip in a little--
-I got it.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.548
Okay.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.051
April's mine. I got it.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.219
All right. You got it.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.934
Rory's showing her
the stress tap dancing videos.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.768
God bless that girl.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.528
- <i>Ace, hi.</i>
- I wake you up?

06:43.611 --> 06:44.904
I wish.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.449
I've been on the phone
with the company rep in China.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.242
I couldn't get the guy to talk slower.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.077
-The time zones are killing me.
-Mm-hmm.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.788
<i>Why can't it be the same time everywhere?</i>
<i>Time zones suck.</i>

06:53.871 --> 06:56.583
Yeah, they do.
They do suck.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.503
<i>- You okay?</i>
- I'm fine... I guess.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.631
I don't know.
I'm in a weird mood.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.050
-Anything I can help with?
<i>-No.</i>

07:05.133 --> 07:06.801
Yes. Uh--

07:06.884 --> 07:10.180
<i>Hey, I know I'm coming out</i>
<i>in a couple weeks, but--</i>

07:10.263 --> 07:11.806
Oh, come on, don't cancel on me now.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.017
I've got <i>Matilda</i> tickets,
planned pony rides,

07:14.101 --> 07:15.685
there's a freak show in town.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.563
No, not canceling. I just thought...

07:18.646 --> 07:21.441
Well, I'm not really doing
much of anything these days,

07:21.524 --> 07:24.361
and I'm a little bored,
and I thought maybe I'd come out sooner.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.988
<i>-Like tomorrow.</i>
-Oh.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.322
Is that okay?

07:27.405 --> 07:29.783
Uh, sure. Yes, let's do it this week.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.701
We'll make it special.
Your favorite place,

07:31.784 --> 07:33.411
The Dorchester or the Savoy.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.289
-I'd have to stay in a hotel?
<i>-Well...</i>

07:37.749 --> 07:39.209
She's in town?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.211
<i>Yes.</i>

07:42.045 --> 07:43.380
For how long?

07:47.259 --> 07:48.468
She's moved in?

07:50.053 --> 07:51.138
Yes.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.390
When?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475
-Couple of weeks ago.
<i>-Okay.</i>

07:55.558 --> 07:58.686
-Were you gonna tell me?
-Of course I was.

07:58.770 --> 08:02.816
So now you want me to just wait in a hotel
until you can slip away and come see me?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.068
<i>-No.</i>
-Like I'm a geisha?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.570
-Come on, that's not fair.
<i>-I know.</i>

08:07.654 --> 08:10.198
I knew about Odette. I just...

08:10.281 --> 08:12.117
Like a hotel... It's just weird.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.743
It doesn't have to be.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.997
<i>Look, can't we just</i>
<i>keep the plans the same?</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:21.293
Come out in three weeks,
and we will figure it all out then.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.212
Please?

08:24.796 --> 08:25.672
<i>Rory?</i>

08:26.423 --> 08:28.591
Okay. Yeah, a few weeks.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.218
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

08:30.301 --> 08:32.137
Yeah. Me, too.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.853
Oh, my God.
Feel that.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.564
- Feel what?
- It's not sweltering.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.359
They finally got air-conditioning.
We don't have to sweat like pigs anymore.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.569
Except Kirk's pig.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.530
-Hey, kiddo. I forgot to say welcome back.
-I'm not back.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.574
Welcome back.
Always knew you'd be back.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.451
You were wrong, Bootsy,
because I'm not back.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.494
-You look back to me.
-Welcome back, Rory.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.622
-Compare notes, people. Please.
-Are you digging this air?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.749
First summer my pits
aren't sticking like duct tape.

09:01.833 --> 09:02.834
It's fantastic.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.962
-You know about the Thirtysomething Gang?
-No, what's that?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.005
It's a group of kids, all about your age.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.133
They've been to college,
then out in the real world,

09:10.216 --> 09:11.968
and it spit 'em out
like a piece of gum.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.512
Now they're all back
in their old rooms, like you.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.723
-I'm not back.
-They all hang out together.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.308
That's them there.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.731
So dig out your shoes and ball,
'cause tomorrow you're all goin' bowlin'.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.441
I don't have a ball or shoes.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.359
Did you know
about the Thirtysomething Gang?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.612
Yeah, everyone does. Hey, guys!

09:32.114 --> 09:33.198
Don't encourage this.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.909
All right, everyone,
settle in, please.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.080
Hope you're all enjoying
the nice, cool air in here.

09:40.163 --> 09:44.334
And I hope you'll enjoy
the announcement I get to make tonight.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.461
-Sounds exciting.
-Hit us with it, Taylor.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.963
Ladies and gentlemen,
Stars Hollow is going to--

09:50.047 --> 09:51.341
What the hell is that?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.717
-What?
-The hell is that?

09:52.801 --> 09:55.804
-I don't know what you're saying!
-It's the air conditioner!

09:55.887 --> 09:56.888
That, I heard.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.390
-It feels like an earthquake!
-Strawberry shortcake?

09:59.474 --> 10:01.476
-What?
-Something about strawberry shortcake?

10:01.559 --> 10:04.854
-Taylor, shut it off!
-Now I'm hungry for strawberry shortcake!

10:04.937 --> 10:07.023
I can't!
It turns on and off by itself!

10:07.107 --> 10:09.401
This is gonna freak out
the Thirtysomething Gang!

10:09.484 --> 10:10.735
They're very sensitive!

10:13.696 --> 10:15.490
Might need a little adjustment.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.869
Back to my announcement, people.
But first, a little backstory.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.038
Our summer tourist numbers are down.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.207
Even at the pool, revenues are off,

10:24.291 --> 10:27.043
which I attribute
to the recent criminal activity

10:27.127 --> 10:28.586
involving the floaty hut.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.588
What happened to my floaty hut?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.924
I thought you didn't want people to know
you donated it.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.801
I don't, but it's my floaty hut.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.971
Our Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer event
is coming up, and that'll help,

10:39.055 --> 10:41.849
but we thought a supersized event

10:41.933 --> 10:45.603
would generate fresh enthusiasm
for tourists to visit.

10:45.687 --> 10:51.401
- Therefore, I am pleased to announce...
<i>- The Musical!</i>

10:51.484 --> 10:53.570
-I love that!
-Sounds fun.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.282
This will be an enchanting
musical history of Stars Hollow.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.826
Book and lyrics by, uh, yours truly.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.330
Music by a very talented young composer.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.706
He once lived in Brooklyn.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.499
Nat Compton.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.085
That's Nat sitting
at the end of the first row.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.420
He'll be directing, as well.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.755
Let's give him a nice hand.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.343
Whoa, give him a crystal sword,
he's a White Walker.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.095
Our biggest hurdle
will be finding our leading lady.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.932
She's got to be a great singer,
a terrific actress,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.643
a nimble dancer, a dexterous whittler.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.229
-She has to whittle?
-Or fake it.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.771
How do you fake whittling?

11:28.855 --> 11:31.566
Yeah, they'd see
there's no shavings coming off the wood.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.776
Come on, Taylor, production values matter.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.614
Now, what I need from you tonight
are volunteers

11:37.697 --> 11:39.782
for the musical's advisory committee.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.160
You'll come to a couple of the shows,
and give us any ideas

11:43.245 --> 11:46.789
that will help make it all that it can be.
Who's in?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.709
-It sounds fun.
-What does?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.003
The advisory committee.
I'm gonna volunteer for it.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.171
-You think you got the time?
-8:30.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.674
-He asked you if you have the time!
-I gave it to him!

11:56.758 --> 11:58.385
-For the committee!
-I'll make time.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.388
-I'm gonna sign up, too!
-Babette, please, warn us!

12:01.471 --> 12:03.806
-I think it sounds fun.
-It sounds really fun.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.809
I just hope the show is as successful
as Taylor needs it to be!

12:06.893 --> 12:08.520
Once again, warn us.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.229
It's really got to pack 'em in!

12:10.313 --> 12:12.399
If Taylor really wanted to pack 'em in,

12:12.482 --> 12:14.817
he should get up on that stage
and dance around

12:14.901 --> 12:17.028
in his floppy Taylor underpants.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.909
Was so out of context.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.078
So, who's up for being
on the advisory committee?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.497
-Me.
-Me, too.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.583
-I'll do it.
-So, uh, Lorelai, Tom and Sophie.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.709
I'm there, Taylor.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.711
-I can make it work.
-Me, too.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.673
Well, I'm loving
the community spirit here.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.342
Um, schedules to be announced.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.261
Uh, now, our last issue, people.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.597
This unfortunately is... less pleasant.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.766
So, we're back to the floaty hut?

12:46.849 --> 12:48.893
Who gives a crap about the floaty hut?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.520
I don't. I'm just curious.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.730
If you're so curious,
why don't you marry it?

12:52.814 --> 12:56.609
After 89 years of continual operation,

12:56.693 --> 12:59.195
the <i>Stars Hollow Gazette</i> is shutting down.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.448
-Are you kidding?
-I'm gonna miss the coupons.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.784
-I'm gonna miss the poem on the front.
-Yeah, the seasonal poem.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.578
Why is it shutting down, Taylor?
Money?

13:06.661 --> 13:09.080
No, it was still operating in the black.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.165
But the paper's editor,
Bernie Roundbottom--

13:13.292 --> 13:14.336
Come on.

13:14.419 --> 13:18.465
Bernie retired as editor,
and there's no one to take his place.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.132
-Oh, well.
-It had a good run.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.801
Eighty-nine years, not bad.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.554
Really? Am I the only one
who's in shock over this news?

13:24.637 --> 13:28.475
Well, I had discussed the possibility
of the <i>Gazette</i> shutting down

13:28.558 --> 13:30.477
at an earlier meeting,
before you were back.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.603
I'm not back.

13:31.686 --> 13:35.189
I figured the Thirtysomething Gang
would've filled you in by now.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.733
I don't hang out with them.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.736
So, unless there's other business
anybody wants to bring up...

13:39.819 --> 13:41.696
What about the floaty hut?

13:41.779 --> 13:43.155
Really, get a room.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.117
What about it?
It is broken and down for the season.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.910
Did they find the bums who broke it?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.621
I wonder what Luke and the floaty hut's
kids are gonna look like.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.998
Shut up.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.876
Excuse me...
Um, excuse me, everybody...

13:56.711 --> 13:59.130
Uh, most everybody...

14:00.214 --> 14:02.884
I gotta say, just shutting down
the <i>Stars Hollow Gazette</i> like this,

14:02.967 --> 14:05.219
with all its tradition and history,

14:05.302 --> 14:07.847
without even putting up
the tiniest fight, it just seems...

14:18.400 --> 14:19.901
...wrong.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.071
They're still closing.
Have a good night, people!

14:24.155 --> 14:26.157
Wait. What about my floaty hut?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.576
-It's waiting in bed for you.
-Shut up, Bootsy.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.037
-I think your anonymous cover's blown.
-Then screw it.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.790
If no one else gives a damn about it,
then I don't either.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.957
That's the spirit.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.722
My word, but it's sweltering today.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.767
Sultry.
That's what it is. Sultry.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.351
Brandon, I'm out.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.064
Thank you, Brandon.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.400
I'm just mad about the boy.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.778
Ah, yes,
lots of returning favorites today.

15:03.861 --> 15:07.031
-There's old Butter Butt.
-And our good friend, Back Fat Pat.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.535
-Tell me, is he of the Maryland Back Fats?
-I believe he is.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.329
- They did a job on that floaty hut.
- Is it fixable?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.498
-I'm trying.
-Excuse me, Mr. Hasselhoff?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.625
I do not wanna talk about the T-shirt.

15:17.709 --> 15:18.835
Then we will not.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.753
A little to the right, Dewey, please.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.799
As the sun moves, Dewey, it would
help if you moved the parasol with it.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.218
-Yes, m'lady.
-I taught him to call me that.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.886
You're shameless.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.346
Hey! Yo, yo, yo!

15:30.430 --> 15:33.140
No diving off the edge like that!
There's rules!

15:34.141 --> 15:36.268
All right, that's it.
Everybody out of the pool.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.355
Right now. Come on.
Out! Let's go.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.817
You give a man a lifeguard T-shirt,
it goes straight to his head.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.903
I'm sleepy.
I think I'll nap, Brandon.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.989
-Yes, Khaleesi.
-Ooh, that's good, too.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.491
Night, night.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.200
-Hey, you're back!
-I'm not back.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.285
-I'm talking to Michel.
-Oh. Hi, Michel.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.914
Hello, Rory.
Yes, I got back yesterday.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.875
-How are things at the inn? Good?
-Well--

15:58.958 --> 16:01.461
Great. Frederick makes me come here
and be around kids

16:01.544 --> 16:04.672
so I acclimate to them
for when we make our own.

16:04.756 --> 16:05.923
Is that right, "make them"?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.509
-Or have them.
-Whatever.

16:07.592 --> 16:11.012
Fatherhood is just going to be
a lot of pretending for me.

16:11.596 --> 16:12.930
Okay, bye-bye.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.182
Wow.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.351
He didn't even call
to tell me he was back.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.062
-He's French.
-It's way more than that.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.775
You know, the <i>Stars Hollow Gazette</i>
is the first newspaper I ever read.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.401
-Hmm.
-The <i>Gazette.</i>

16:25.485 --> 16:27.194
My love of words came from that paper.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.488
-Oh, my God.
-What?

16:28.571 --> 16:30.698
- Incoming.
- Hey, there.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.742
-Hey, Pat.
-Oh, hi. Hi, Pat.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.826
Welcome back, Rory.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.496
- Oh, I'm not back, fat...
- I mean, back, Pat.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.373
So you're pool people, huh?
Never would have taken you for it.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.543
-Oh, you--
-Uh... no.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.670
-Just... sometimes.
-Was kinda.

16:43.753 --> 16:44.962
-Well, got to get going.
-Okay.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.298
- Okay, see ya, Pat.
- See ya.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.260
It's just so stressful being here.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.555
Dewey? Adjust.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.986
That looks like fun.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.744
Okay, so we got all your info here.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.330
Hang on to your sheet music
and knock 'em dead.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.541
Hello.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.001
-Hello.
-Hi, there.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.587
-Hi, Babette. Hi, Patty.
-Shh, we're working here!

17:27.088 --> 17:30.550
So you got your sheet music there,
Mr. Tall, Dark and Yowza?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.260
- Yup, all set.
- Name's Kevin?

17:32.343 --> 17:36.222
Nice, but I think I'll call you...
tomorrow.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.389
Babette, no.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.809
There's the line.
Good luck, Kevin.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.479
-Wow, thanks a lot.
-Yeah, that was a total clam jam.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.064
Don't encourage her.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.899
Go. Go. Scram.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.653
Lorelai! Lorelai!

17:50.737 --> 17:52.321
-Oh, my God.
-Do we know her?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.656
Uh, Claudia.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.950
-Oh, my God. Hi!
-Hi.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.201
Are you auditioning, too?

17:57.284 --> 18:00.079
Oh, no, I was just passing by
with my daughter.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.540
-Is this Rory?
-It is. Yes, this is Rory.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.209
Rory, this is Claudia.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.919
-Hello.
-My therapist.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.170
Hello!

18:08.254 --> 18:12.091
-Hi. Are you involved in this?
-I'm just on the advisory committee.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.301
Can you put in a word for me
with the director?

18:14.385 --> 18:16.303
Absolutely.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.514
- Every bit helps.
- I guess so.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.057
-Mm-hmm.
-So, break something.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.644
What?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.646
-Isn't she supposed to fix you?
-I think so.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.563
- You're totally screwed.
- Ugh.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.734
Oh, I'm on cloud nine.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.236
We've done it.
We've found our leading lady.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.406
-That's great, Taylor.
-I couldn't believe her résumé.

18:35.489 --> 18:39.535
Credits for days.
She sings, she dances, she whittles.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.664
Just look at her.
And look at those gams.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.582
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.919
Present company excepted, right?

18:48.002 --> 18:50.672
No, she's pretty much
the hottest woman I've ever seen.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.674
Hmm. And she was Kinky Boots.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.510
-You mean she was in <i>Kinky Boots.</i>
-No, no, she played the lead.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.763
She was Kinky Boots.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.347
But that's not her name.

19:00.431 --> 19:03.309
There was no character named Kinky Boots.
I saw the show.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.687
Yes, I saw the show, too.

19:05.770 --> 19:09.106
Now, excuse me, ladies.
I've got to get back to work.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.569
Stars Hollow is mounting a big musical,

19:13.653 --> 19:16.030
and no one from the <i>Stars Hollow Gazette</i>
is covering it.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.532
And why? Because there is
no more <i>Stars Hollow Gazette.</i>

19:18.615 --> 19:20.367
-It stinks.
-It stinks? That's it?

19:20.451 --> 19:21.869
The girl was Kinky Boots.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.121
She was in <i>Kinky Boots!</i>
Nobody is named Kinky Boots!

19:24.205 --> 19:26.708
-This is not right.
-No. I saw the show twice.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.709
The <i>Stars Hollow Gazette</i>
cannot just go down.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.837
I mean, it's not Spotlight
at the <i>Boston Globe.</i>

19:30.920 --> 19:33.214
It'll never blow the lid off a cabal
of buggering priests.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.632
We only have one priest in town.
He's a good man.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.926
That's not the <i>Gazette's</i> fault.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.886
-I'll see you back at home.
-Go get 'em!

19:38.970 --> 19:41.097
Hey, world,
you looking for me?

19:56.487 --> 19:59.156
Taylor, do not close
the <i>Stars Hollow Gazette!</i>

19:59.240 --> 20:01.408
-Huh? What was that?
-Khaleesi is speaking.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.036
Bit's over, Brandon.
Do not close the <i>Gazette.</i>

20:04.120 --> 20:06.664
It's a 90-year-old institution,
and it's important to people.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.457
Well, tell that to Bernie Roundbottom.

20:08.540 --> 20:12.128
Marlin fishing in Boca Raton
was more meaningful to that ingrate.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.546
Well...
all it lacks is an editor, right?

20:14.630 --> 20:17.258
So, someone to steer the ship?
I'm your girl!

20:18.009 --> 20:19.969
May I ask what your qualifications are?

20:20.594 --> 20:23.430
-I'm... here.
-Well, that's a good start.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.600
I have a degree in journalism
from Yale University. How's that?

20:26.683 --> 20:30.938
Not bad, but this job will take you away
from the Thirtysomething Gang.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.732
-Have you thought about that?
-I'll adjust.

20:32.815 --> 20:35.860
-Should we discuss salary?
-I assume it pays nothing?

20:35.943 --> 20:39.655
You got the job.
Come, let's go introduce you to the staff.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.948
Lead the way.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.248
Everyone, good news!

20:49.331 --> 20:53.044
We found our editor
and the <i>Gazette</i> is saved.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.336
Some of you know her.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.966
Rory Gilmore, graduate of Yale
and a professional journalist.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.551
She starts immediately.

21:00.634 --> 21:04.513
Now, it may take her a little time
to learn all your names,

21:04.596 --> 21:07.016
but I want you to cooperate with her

21:07.099 --> 21:10.978
and give her 100%
of your skills and capabilities,

21:11.062 --> 21:16.275
just as you did Bernie Roundbottom.
Please, welcome her to the fold.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.485
Hi, I'm Rory.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.655
- Esther.
- Charlie.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.576
Great. Got the names.

21:27.619 --> 21:31.123
We have you in adjoining rooms
eight and nine for four nights.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.625
You are confirmed for tonight
for dinner at 6:30.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.088
Oh, and please take this.
Good for two complimentary cocktails.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.466
-Wonderful. Thanks.
-But I do not want to leave anyone out.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.594
Is there anyone little here today?
Anyone at all?

21:43.677 --> 21:47.056
- We're little! We're little!
- Oh! I did not see you there.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.267
For our special little muppets,
complimentary lollipops.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.602
That is, if you like lollipops.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.728
-Yeah!
-Oh, boy.

21:52.812 --> 21:57.233
Go ahead, take one each.
Now, when I say one, I mean two.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.775
- Oh!
- Thank you.

21:58.859 --> 21:59.860
Enjoy your stay.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.445
-Thank you.
-Yes.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.448
On a scale of one to ten,

22:04.531 --> 22:06.951
how much did I sound
like a child molester?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.703
-Six.
-Oh, getting better. Hmm.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.998
-Lorelai.
-Yeah?

22:12.081 --> 22:14.125
Did you know I just celebrated a birthday?

22:14.208 --> 22:16.793
-Of course I did.
-It was a big one. A milestone.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.670
- Fifty?
- Forty.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.756
-I'm not 50.
-You're not 40.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.968
-I'm not 50.
-Michel, you weren't 17 when we met.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.303
This is the problem
with knowing people a long time.

22:26.387 --> 22:27.596
They can backdate you.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.349
-I'm guessing you're in the middle?
-Somewhere, yes.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.852
So, maybe you can take me out
for a drink tonight? To celebrate?

22:33.936 --> 22:35.354
-Sure.
-And talk?

22:35.437 --> 22:37.273
Yeah, sure.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.440
Let's talk.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.194
Oh, you must be the Mitchells!
We were expecting you.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.948
Oh my, who is that little angel
you brought with you?

22:46.032 --> 22:49.660
She looks like she dropped
straight down from heaven.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.455
Hi, come on in.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.713
Welcome to the Secret Bar.
What can I get you?

23:01.797 --> 23:03.382
-Uh...
-Um...

23:03.465 --> 23:05.676
Gin martini. Cold, dry, twist, please.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.428
Do you have the George Clooney tequila?

23:07.511 --> 23:10.932
The one he enjoys with celebrity friends
on his many tequila-filled nights?

23:11.015 --> 23:13.475
-We've got Jose Cuervo.
-Does he hang out with George Clooney?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.270
Bring me a shot of Jose,
with a little bit of salt on the rim.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.479
-Got it.
-Thank you.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.320
Pretty good crowd tonight.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.364
Yes. Very lively.

23:27.448 --> 23:28.907
So...

23:30.284 --> 23:32.619
"My wife is crying upstairs.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.580
I can hear cars coming in the house.

23:35.581 --> 23:39.168
Consigliere of mine,
I think it's time you tell your Don

23:39.251 --> 23:41.045
what everyone seems to know."

23:41.128 --> 23:42.921
-What?
-It's from <i>The Godfather.</i>

23:43.005 --> 23:46.633
- Oh, not <i>The Godfather</i> again.
- It has a quote for every circumstance.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.344
-You don't have a wife.
-It's not exact.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.636
-And who's Don?
-Michel--

23:49.720 --> 23:52.098
I'm leaving.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.352
I'm out of quotes.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.313
I was not just on vacation.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.899
I had a meeting at the W Hotel.

24:01.983 --> 24:02.984
Oh.

24:03.900 --> 24:08.614
Look, with my experience, my skills,
my charm, don't laugh--

24:08.697 --> 24:11.242
-Wasn't laughing.
-Doors are open to me.

24:11.325 --> 24:15.704
-Good jobs. High-paying jobs.
-I can't say that I'm surprised.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.374
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.044
What I wanted to ask, before it's final,

24:22.128 --> 24:24.463
is there a way
we can expand the Dragonfly?

24:24.546 --> 24:28.050
Make it bigger, add a spa.
I was born to run a spa.

24:28.134 --> 24:31.178
Michel, I've got a nature preserve
on one side,

24:31.262 --> 24:34.515
a fire lane on the other side,
protected wetlands on the other side,

24:34.598 --> 24:37.184
and I'm not allowed to put guests
in the barn unless they eat oats.

24:37.268 --> 24:41.188
Well, I need more. More to do.
More responsibility. More money.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.399
-We have a baby on the way.
-You do?

24:43.482 --> 24:47.319
Yeah, I think Frederick ordered one.
I have to check. Anyway...

24:48.320 --> 24:50.364
I can't just stay in one place forever.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.158
I know.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.743
I think I need to take that job at the W.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.537
- Five-O!
- Five-O!

25:17.015 --> 25:18.267
Clear!

25:26.775 --> 25:28.485
What if I come up with more money for you?

25:28.569 --> 25:31.363
You're overpaying me now.
Part of my pay comes out of yours.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.617
You think Michel only sees
as far as his own reflection?

25:35.701 --> 25:37.869
I see the books.
I need more money.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.456
You need someone you can pay less.
Can you deny that?

25:42.583 --> 25:45.336
What are you doing?
Is your drink sour? What's going on?

25:45.419 --> 25:48.547
-I'm just trying not to cry.
-Lorelai, don't cry.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.675
If you cry, I'll cry. I can't be seen
crying at the Secret Bar.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.344
-It's bad enough that I'm here at all.
-I'm trying not to.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.890
Lane, this dumb slow song is not helping.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.392
Play something happy and uplifting,
please.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.317
It's much better!

26:12.946 --> 26:17.784
I must say, it's been a while since
I've felt such energy and excitement

26:17.868 --> 26:20.246
on the floor
of the <i>Stars Hollow Gazette</i> newsroom.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.831
Yeah, it's like
an Aaron Sorkin movie in here.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.876
Are you not having fun?
I think it's important to have fun.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.085
Oh, I'm having fun.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.755
Right now, I'm experiencing
the joy of MS-DOS.

26:29.838 --> 26:33.300
Well, if you're confused,
Esther here is our computer expert.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.385
- Esther?
- Yes?

26:34.468 --> 26:35.886
What do you know about MS-DOS?

26:35.969 --> 26:39.681
-Is that an actor?
-No, it's the computer operating system.

26:39.765 --> 26:43.227
I know about it from <i>Halt and Catch Fire,</i>
and I didn't watch the show that closely.

26:43.310 --> 26:48.982
Well, I have the instructions here
Mr. Roundbottom gave me. Hold on.

26:52.068 --> 26:55.071
"Turn computer on."
Did you turn it on?

26:55.156 --> 26:57.073
I did everything but blow in its ear.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.452
"Insert floppy disk."
You got your floppy disk?

27:00.536 --> 27:03.164
- Never mind, Esther.
- Happy to help.

27:03.247 --> 27:06.292
Huh, something is not adding up here.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.460
Let's get out the company abacus
and figure it out.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.172
You're printing the poem
on the cover, yes?

27:11.255 --> 27:13.549
-The poem?
-Oh, yes, a poem.

27:13.632 --> 27:17.136
There's been a poem on the cover
of the <i>Gazette </i>celebrating the season

27:17.219 --> 27:20.306
-in every issue we've ever published.
-I know. I'm an avid reader.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.934
-I was thinking of going another way.
-Another way. Okay.

27:24.017 --> 27:27.938
Editor's choice, I guess.
I'll leave you to it.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.314
See you later, Taylor.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.150
-Coffee pot needs washing.
-And a jackhammer.

27:33.194 --> 27:36.405
Oh, hello, Taylor. Just came by
to visit my little Perry White.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.951
Now, she's working.
Don't distract her too much.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.788
Five-O!

27:44.871 --> 27:47.583
I've had a long day.
A very long day.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.710
Me, too.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.421
A magical desk.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.093
Tell me, is this Scotch old?

27:58.176 --> 28:02.473
Judging by the "Save for VE Day,"
scrawled on the label, I'd say yes.

28:02.556 --> 28:03.682
Bottoms up.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.853
Oops, we woke Charlie up.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.648
I just left Michel at the Secret Bar.
It's final. He's leaving.

28:11.732 --> 28:12.733
Really?

28:12.816 --> 28:15.235
He's giving me three months
to find someone to replace him.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.280
-Claims it may not be enough time.
-Always humble, our Michel.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.741
I'm really gonna miss him.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.368
Me, too.

28:23.285 --> 28:24.328
What?

28:24.411 --> 28:25.579
-Paul.
-Who?

28:25.662 --> 28:27.373
-Come on.
-You haven't broken up with him?

28:27.456 --> 28:29.500
Let's have another round tonight.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.550
Shoot! Woke Charlie up again.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.676
Oh.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.434
Well, we did it, folks.

28:47.518 --> 28:50.562
Our first issue of the <i>Gazette</i>
is ready to hit the stands.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.399
-It's not my first issue.
-Or mine, neither.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.066
Well, no, but it's mine.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.695
It's an accomplishment. A milestone.
We should open some champagne.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.406
Gives me gas.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.742
Hey, question. What's the next step?

29:03.825 --> 29:06.077
-Huh?
-Where do the papers go?

29:06.161 --> 29:09.290
All the businesses in town get a stack.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.208
Yes, but who delivers the stacks?

29:19.591 --> 29:20.592
How's it going in here?

29:20.676 --> 29:23.136
Fine, if Eric would run plates
while they're hot!

29:23.219 --> 29:25.138
Customers cornered him.
He'll be right in.

29:25.221 --> 29:28.934
Great. Eric's chatting about
the Red Sox while the food's getting cold?

29:29.017 --> 29:32.438
- Oh, he hates the Red Sox.
- And you. I'm mad at you.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.315
-Why are you mad at me?
-You know why.

29:34.398 --> 29:37.150
Are you doing this?
Are you siccing the mountain man on me?

29:37.233 --> 29:40.654
The couple from New York
wants to know if the meat is Pat LaFrieda?

29:40.737 --> 29:41.822
-What?
-Is it Pat LaFrieda?

29:41.905 --> 29:43.657
The couple from New York wants to know

29:43.740 --> 29:46.285
if I ground up some guy
named Pat LaFrieda and served him?

29:46.368 --> 29:47.411
Tell them yeah.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.622
Give them this. They'll like it.
I put Pat's pancreas in there.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.624
Luke, hon, have I thanked you lately

29:52.708 --> 29:55.210
for hosting Tuesday Burger Day
at the Dragonfly?

29:55.294 --> 29:57.754
- There's no need.
- But if it's driving you crazy--

29:57.838 --> 29:59.214
-I'm fine.
-You don't seem fine.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.841
I'm just trying to keep things going.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.092
Okay.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.176
Hi.

30:03.259 --> 30:05.429
- Help. I need help.
<i>- What?</i>

30:05.512 --> 30:07.514
-With what?
-Gazette. <i>Now.</i>

30:07.598 --> 30:09.140
-Bring walking shoes.
-Uh--

30:09.224 --> 30:11.643
- You know I have a business!
- I know.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.395
Instead of being there, running the diner,

30:13.479 --> 30:16.898
I'm here, talking about whether or not
I ground up some Italian guy

30:16.982 --> 30:18.149
and served him in my burgers.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.901
Pat LaFrieda is a New York butcher.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.445
-Hire a chef.
-I will.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.030
-Soon.
-Uh, I'm gonna go get one right now.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.533
Wait.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.452
Are you just gonna leave me here?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.829
Hello? Eric?

30:30.912 --> 30:33.374
Somebody?
Hello?

30:34.207 --> 30:36.335
-Got the list? Shoes on tight?
-Check. Check.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.794
Let's do this.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.089
You take the west side,
I'll take the east.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.633
Got it.

30:42.716 --> 30:43.925
-Where are you going?
-West.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.301
-That's east.
-That's west.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.471
It's not. See?
Eastside Dental. It's east.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.890
And the name of the dentist
at Eastside Dental is...

30:49.973 --> 30:52.393
Dr. Eastside.
Holy cow, I just put that together?

30:52.476 --> 30:55.437
Look, you take that side of town,
I'll take this side.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.522
Deal.

31:31.682 --> 31:34.017
-Rory, wait!
-What's up, guys?

31:34.100 --> 31:36.061
-Where's the poem?
-Didn't have room for it.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.354
-You didn't have room?
-But the poem is great.

31:38.439 --> 31:39.565
The poem is traditional.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.900
-Now there's just words.
-Those are articles.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.736
-Articles?
-Who reads the <i>Gazette</i> for the articles?

31:44.820 --> 31:47.030
Thanks for coming.
We appreciate your business.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.740
You look exhausted.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.076
Calling in reinforcements.

31:51.159 --> 31:54.370
Okay. I'll take the west side,
you take the east side.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.584
- That's west.
- That's east.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.002
Dewey, I am telling you
that is the west side.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.171
Nope. There's 38 here.
I'm supposed to get 40.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.506
I'll come back with two more.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.342
-I can't accept partial delivery.
-You can and you will.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.053
Bernie Roundbottom
never conducted business like this!

32:10.136 --> 32:12.598
Well, there's
a new Bernie Roundbottom in town!

32:18.604 --> 32:21.147
Shellfish gets better with age,
Mrs. Cassini.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.273
Everyone knows that.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.068
Already got a complaint from Bootsy.
You shorted him.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.863
-I don't care!
-And people are missing the poem!

32:27.946 --> 32:29.823
Just a heads-up!

32:42.836 --> 32:45.171
Hey. What are you guys up to?

32:45.255 --> 32:48.133
We're doing
"I drink your milkshake! I drink it up!"

32:48.216 --> 32:49.968
-It's from <i>There Will Be Blood.</i>
-The movie?

32:50.051 --> 32:52.512
Mm-hmm. We love everything
Paul Thomas Anderson does.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.681
-We're the Thirtysomething Gang!
-See ya.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.477
Hello?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.228
Rory. Doyle.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.648
-Hey, Doyle. What's up?
<i>-Nothing much with me.</i>

33:02.731 --> 33:05.609
What's up with you
ruining my movie review in the <i>Gazette?</i>

33:05.692 --> 33:07.694
Doyle, please.
I'm in the middle of my route.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.530
<i>I was doing you a favor, right?</i>

33:09.613 --> 33:13.408
You'd asked me if I'd like to contribute?
I said yes, help out an old friend,

33:13.492 --> 33:15.326
and then you butchered it
like a piece of veal.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.870
Your review of <i>The Jungle Book</i>

33:16.953 --> 33:20.456
took a 20,000-word detour
into the history of African colonialism.

33:20.541 --> 33:22.959
So you're gonna get
all anti-intellectual now?

33:23.043 --> 33:24.503
5,000 of those words were adjectives.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.297
<i>-Who says adjectives are bad?</i>
-You, when you were my editor.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.508
I'm writing a couple things
for Michael Bay,

33:29.591 --> 33:31.467
and he's really into adjectives.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.637
You trust his grammatical stylings
over me?

33:33.720 --> 33:35.889
-Are you saying I'm a sell-out?
-No, I'm not.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.892
I played snooker at his house last night,
and he's really cool.

33:38.975 --> 33:42.312
-I don't have time for this.
<i>-What idiot got rid of the poem?</i>

33:44.064 --> 33:45.273
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.317
We've been meaning to introduce ourselves.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.654
We get together a couple times a week,
read our kids' résumés,

33:50.737 --> 33:53.532
trade job tips,
just offer general support.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.617
We're the parents
of the Thirtysomething Gang.

33:55.701 --> 33:56.743
See ya.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.248
Are you kidding me?

34:02.332 --> 34:04.876
- She was here about 20 minutes ago.
<i>- Hey, there.</i>

34:04.960 --> 34:06.712
I just found newspapers at Mrs. Kim's.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.756
<i>I just found newspapers</i>
<i>at the dentist's. So there.</i>

34:09.840 --> 34:12.551
Oh! For the love of--
We're hitting the same spots!

34:12.634 --> 34:15.011
<i>Well, then stop hitting</i>
<i>the east side, Rory!</i>

34:15.095 --> 34:17.263
No. I'm hitting the west side!

34:17.347 --> 34:20.350
No! Dewey said
this is the east side!

34:20.433 --> 34:22.018
That's the west side!

34:22.102 --> 34:23.895
We need a better system!

34:24.813 --> 34:28.024
I drink your milkshake!
I drink it up!

34:29.484 --> 34:30.986
Going to the gym?

34:31.069 --> 34:36.575
Oh, yeah.
I just... gotta go home and get my stuff.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.452
- Great. I'll see you there.
- Okay.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.374
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

34:44.457 --> 34:46.877
- Rory!
- Ouch! Ouch!

34:46.960 --> 34:49.671
-Ouch, my feet bloody hurt.
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

34:49.755 --> 34:51.381
-What's wrong?
-My feet hurt.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.342
-I told you to wear comfy shoes.
-Even comfy shoes cannot offset

34:54.426 --> 34:56.303
the effects of the Bataan Death March. Ow!

34:56.386 --> 34:57.888
This walking thing is for chumps.

34:57.971 --> 35:00.181
I have newfound respect
for people who deliver things.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.684
Next time I see the UPS guy,
I'm gonna make him happy.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.144
Ew.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.147
- I want a raise.
- Talk to my office manager.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.481
-Who's your office manager?
-Me.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.441
Hey, I want a raise.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.484
At the year-end review,
I'll throw you something.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.903
Did we order Chinese, Greek and Italian
last night?

35:13.987 --> 35:16.239
-And hot dogs.
-Ugh. Last night's a blur.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.866
What did we end up watching?

35:17.949 --> 35:21.119
<i>Sound of Fear,</i>
or <i>Co-Ed Call Girl?</i>

35:21.202 --> 35:22.787
I'd remember if we'd rocked a Spelling.

35:22.871 --> 35:26.541
They should make a Lifetime movie
out of Tori Spelling falling at Benihana.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.209
<i>Grill of Death.</i>

35:28.293 --> 35:30.879
- That reminds me, I need to call Grandma.
- Oh, yes.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.506
When I think of blistering burns,
I also think of my mother.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.842
Ouch! Ouch!

35:38.344 --> 35:40.138
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Grandma.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.765
<i>-Yes?</i>
-It's Rory.

35:41.848 --> 35:45.393
<i>-Oh! Rory. Hello.</i>
-Are you okay?

35:45.476 --> 35:48.647
Uh, I guess. I...
I just need some coffee.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.357
Berta, have the cousins bring me coffee!

35:51.441 --> 35:54.235
-Did I just wake you up?
<i>-No, I was just dozing.</i>

35:54.319 --> 35:57.363
-Are you sick?
-No, I... I'm fine.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.614
What time is it?

35:58.699 --> 36:00.784
-It's almost noon.
<i>-Already?</i>

36:00.867 --> 36:03.662
Noon is when dock workers
and rock stars get up.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.206
Are you doing some moonlighting
I don't know about?

36:06.289 --> 36:09.042
Uh, no. Where are my glasses?

36:09.125 --> 36:11.586
Listen, I'd like to come see you.
When are you free?

36:11.670 --> 36:15.256
-I don't know. What day is it?
<i>-It's Saturday.</i>

36:15.799 --> 36:21.179
Well, I have a DAR meeting on Thursday,
but other than that, I'm free.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.056
-So maybe I'll--
<i>-Wait a minute. Hold on.</i>

36:23.139 --> 36:25.016
Berta, was that the door?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.102
<i>I'm sorry, Rory. I have to go.</i>

36:27.185 --> 36:28.687
Grandma--

36:32.065 --> 36:33.066
Ouch! Ouch!

36:33.149 --> 36:35.318
I kind of dig it.
It's like you're wearing a cowbell.

36:35.402 --> 36:38.905
Well, dig this.
Grandma was asleep, and it's almost noon.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.366
-Hmm.
-I woke her up!

36:42.784 --> 36:45.370
Are you hearing me?
I woke up Emily Gilmore at noon.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.372
-I heard.
-It's weird.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.539
It's weird.

36:49.124 --> 36:52.210
Thanks for the support
you've given her. That's been helpful.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.337
Hey! She's the one who quit therapy

36:54.420 --> 36:56.840
and drove that poor woman
into show business.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.674
-You're a child.
-Get used to it.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.677
I have to head to the <i>Gazette.</i>
News never sleeps. Ouch!

37:01.762 --> 37:03.221
-Ouch! Ouch!
-Ouch!

37:03.304 --> 37:04.931
- Ouch! Ouch!
- Ouch! Ouch!

37:05.932 --> 37:10.145
Welcome, everyone, to the first
run-through of <i>Stars Hollow: The Musical.</i>

37:10.228 --> 37:14.107
This is a special preview performance
for our advisory committee,

37:14.190 --> 37:17.610
and for a few select friends and family.

37:17.693 --> 37:22.532
I think you're all in for a real treat.
But first, some business.

37:22.615 --> 37:26.452
What you see here today
needs to remain strictly confidential.

37:26.536 --> 37:29.455
But rather than having
good neighbors such as yourselves

37:29.539 --> 37:31.875
sign some cold legal document,

37:31.958 --> 37:35.045
how about you all raise your right hands
and repeat after me?

37:35.670 --> 37:38.339
I, Stars Hollow theater lover...

37:38.423 --> 37:40.884
I, Stars Hollow theater lover...

37:40.967 --> 37:46.306
hereby swear that I will not divulge
any portion of this show in any way...

37:46.389 --> 37:51.060
hereby swear that I will not divulge
any portion of this show in any way...

37:51.144 --> 37:54.898
out of respect for
the hard-working creators of this musical,

37:54.981 --> 37:56.191
so help me God,

37:56.274 --> 38:00.570
or Allah, or Buddha,
or whatever it is you pray to.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.574
out of respect for
the hard-working creators of this musical,

38:04.657 --> 38:05.658
so help me God,

38:05.741 --> 38:10.163
or Allah, or Buddha,
or whoever it is you pray to.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.040
Wow! Are we excited about this!

38:12.123 --> 38:14.209
Wow! Are we excited about this!

38:14.292 --> 38:16.920
No, uh, people,
the repeating part is over.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.464
You'll see that the show
is a little rough,

38:19.547 --> 38:24.302
but Nat and I have put our hearts
and souls into this, haven't we, Nat?

38:26.179 --> 38:28.849
-He needs more fiber, that boy.
-Or last rites.

38:28.932 --> 38:33.478
Under each of your seats is a pen
and clipboard with sheets of blank paper,

38:33.561 --> 38:35.480
ready for your feedback.

38:35.563 --> 38:40.276
Feel free to jot down any critique
or suggestion any time during the show.

38:40.360 --> 38:47.033
And now, sit back, relax,
and enjoy <i>Stars Hollow: The Musical!</i>

38:58.544 --> 39:00.421
One more for the road, huh?

39:01.672 --> 39:03.842
Can't a man enjoy a glass of whiskey

39:03.925 --> 39:07.470
after a hard day's work
here in Stars Hollow?

39:07.553 --> 39:08.638
A man can.

39:09.389 --> 39:13.018
But there's no man in this room.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.394
- What the--
- Shh!

39:14.477 --> 39:16.646
But, look at the--

39:16.729 --> 39:18.899
You were always a sly cat, Felix.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.860
But your talons have dulled.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.240
A cat has nine lives.

39:27.323 --> 39:30.201
-And all of mine are in the past!
-Meow.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.413
I wish I was in the past.
It's better than any future with you!

39:33.496 --> 39:34.830
Low blow!

39:34.915 --> 39:36.917
What's happening?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.877
I don't know!

39:38.960 --> 39:40.045
Hold on!

39:42.172 --> 39:44.049
What?

40:08.323 --> 40:09.991
No. What?

40:47.070 --> 40:48.071
The guy is hot.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.893
What a night!

41:18.977 --> 41:21.146
It's nothing but ice out there.

41:21.229 --> 41:24.107
Well, come inside. Warm yourself.

41:24.190 --> 41:27.402
Here, take my musket and ammunition
while I pour myself a drink.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.613
My God!
Your balls are frozen!

41:30.696 --> 41:33.366
It must be ten below out there.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.993
But you're all right.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.038
My brave soldier.

41:38.121 --> 41:40.165
Not so fast with the encomiums!

41:42.917 --> 41:44.460
Encomiums. Encomiums?

41:44.544 --> 41:46.921
We stood there all night,
but the British never came.

41:48.589 --> 41:51.801
-I'm not the man you think I am.
-But you are.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.305
Go on.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.822
All right. Hold tight, everyone.

44:17.905 --> 44:21.867
We have a quick costume change,
and next up, the Industrial Revolution.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.205
Hey, can I borrow your pen?

44:25.288 --> 44:27.290
Sure. Why?

44:27.373 --> 44:28.999
Advisory committee.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.084
Okay...

44:32.503 --> 44:35.089
Well, here we are. 1891.

44:35.173 --> 44:39.177
Did you hear about the new sport
that this Dr. James Naismith created?

44:39.260 --> 44:41.053
It'll never catch on.

44:41.136 --> 44:43.556
-What's it called?
-Basketball.

44:45.308 --> 44:46.559
I had an idea today.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.228
-For an invention.
-What is it?

44:48.311 --> 44:51.689
A machine that would wash
your dinner dishes automatically.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.608
That's a wonderful idea!

44:53.691 --> 44:55.901
I'll build the factory
here in Stars Hollow.

44:55.985 --> 44:59.405
-We'll be rich!
-As long as the workers stay complacent.

44:59.489 --> 45:00.531
And non-rhythmic.

45:00.615 --> 45:02.700
Yo, yo, yo! Not so fast!

45:02.783 --> 45:04.327
-Wait a second.
-I say!

45:04.410 --> 45:06.371
Let me tell you what I'm talking about.

45:06.454 --> 45:07.622
Oy vey...

47:21.881 --> 47:23.424
No. Come on.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.469
Lorelai, what is your problem?

47:26.552 --> 47:28.262
What's next, a kickline?

47:30.139 --> 47:31.348
No. No.

47:34.394 --> 47:36.270
I'm Nostradamus.

48:13.849 --> 48:17.895
Okay. Well, uh...
Wow!

48:17.978 --> 48:21.065
Where are we gonna meet to go over this?
What's happening?

48:21.148 --> 48:22.525
Sit down!

48:22.608 --> 48:23.901
Ooh. Sorry.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.452
Oh, no.

48:32.535 --> 48:33.744
Gotta be kidding me.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.211
-You're not getting up?
-I guess I am.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.171
-You're not gonna clap?
-Yes I am.

48:48.258 --> 48:49.760
Yay.

48:51.554 --> 48:56.892
So, this is the zero hour, people.
It's been a lot of hard work,

48:56.976 --> 49:01.606
and Nat and I are certainly proud
of what we've accomplished thus far.

49:01.689 --> 49:04.817
But now, I need to hear
from my trusted stable of advisors,

49:04.900 --> 49:08.529
and I want the unvarnished truth,
warts and all.

49:08.613 --> 49:11.365
So hit me with it.
Hold nothing back.

49:11.448 --> 49:13.200
We can take it.

49:14.869 --> 49:17.872
-This show is fantastic!
-Ah! I knew it!

49:17.955 --> 49:21.125
Simba, you've been dethroned.
Bow to the new king.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.377
It moves. It breathes.

49:23.460 --> 49:26.296
Add an orchestra,
you can take it straight to Broadway.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.841
<i>School of Rock.</i> Bunch of schlock.
This show gets an "A."

49:28.924 --> 49:31.927
I know nothing about musicals,
but this is a fun musical.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.638
The book was terrific, too.

49:33.721 --> 49:36.724
Tevye, move over.
There's a new Jew in town.

49:36.807 --> 49:39.727
Well, it seems
like we've got unanimity here.

49:41.186 --> 49:42.479
Or do we?

49:44.106 --> 49:46.567
- Hmm?
- You're awfully quiet.

49:46.650 --> 49:49.320
And you've been writing an awful lot
on your clipboards there.

49:49.403 --> 49:51.989
Clipboards?
You needed more than one clipboard?

49:52.072 --> 49:55.284
-Hey, Babette was writing a lot, too.
-I was writing my funny zingers.

49:55.367 --> 49:59.955
Hasa diga eebowai, you Mormon nerds.
Audiences are ringing a new doorbell!

50:00.039 --> 50:01.791
I got 26 more of these.

50:01.874 --> 50:04.126
So, I guess we're waiting
for your opinion?

50:04.710 --> 50:07.796
Right. Well...

50:07.880 --> 50:12.593
I think... for a first run-through,
it was... yeah.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.680
"Yeah" is not an opinion.

50:15.763 --> 50:18.223
Didn't you think it was charming?
I thought it was.

50:18.307 --> 50:19.725
I did. I thought it was charming.

50:19.808 --> 50:23.687
I, uh, just had a few questions
and maybe a few suggestions.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.648
-Really?
-What's your suggestion?

50:25.731 --> 50:26.816
Make it less perfect?

50:26.899 --> 50:30.069
Now, now, people,
I asked for the unvarnished truth.

50:30.152 --> 50:32.362
Let's hear Lorelai's notes.
Lorelai?

50:32.446 --> 50:36.366
Okay.
So, first, that opening scene...

50:36.450 --> 50:39.328
With her black eye, the whiskey,
the weird, gritty whatever it was.

50:39.411 --> 50:40.495
What was that about?

50:40.580 --> 50:44.541
The opening scene is an excerpt
from a play I wrote in college

50:44.625 --> 50:48.963
that happened to be blessed by my mentor,
the great Edward Albee.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.840
You may know him

50:50.923 --> 50:54.719
as the author of a little something called
<i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

50:54.802 --> 50:56.846
-Impressive.
-Wow.

50:56.929 --> 50:58.764
- You worked with Edward Albee?
- Yes.

50:58.848 --> 51:02.852
I was at Joe Allen one night, years ago,
and I dropped the script on Albee's table

51:02.935 --> 51:05.354
with my phone number
and asked him to call me with notes.

51:05.437 --> 51:08.148
Any notes at all
that would make it better than it was.

51:08.232 --> 51:11.526
And... he never called.

51:11.611 --> 51:13.112
Wow!

51:13.195 --> 51:14.404
Congratulations, Taylor.

51:14.488 --> 51:18.450
So, Edward Albee's eating at Joe Allen,
you drop a script at his table,

51:18.533 --> 51:21.203
he never calls,
and that makes him your mentor?

51:21.286 --> 51:23.873
You just don't understand
the theater community.

51:23.956 --> 51:24.999
I guess not.

51:25.082 --> 51:26.876
I have dinner reservations.
Are you done?

51:26.959 --> 51:28.377
-What about the rapping?
-What?

51:28.460 --> 51:30.170
-Is this getting racial?
-A little.

51:30.254 --> 51:33.966
No. No. It's not racial. Just...
Isn't it way too <i>Hamilton?</i>

51:34.049 --> 51:36.761
<i>-Hamilton's</i> a smash.
-It won a million Tonys.

51:36.844 --> 51:40.097
It's very popular, but doesn't that make
what we're doing derivative?

51:40.180 --> 51:44.935
So, because <i>Hamilton</i> has rap numbers,
no one else in the world can rap?

51:45.019 --> 51:48.105
You will be so kind as to let
RZA and Busta Rhymes know

51:48.188 --> 51:49.815
that they're not allowed to rap anymore?

51:49.899 --> 51:51.025
How does he know those names?

51:51.108 --> 51:53.610
What about the Civil War number
with the revolving stage?

51:53.694 --> 51:54.779
What was the point of that?

51:54.862 --> 51:59.033
Again, <i>Hamilton</i> utilized a revolving stage
and it worked like gangbusters.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.409
Ours looked like a lazy Susan.

52:00.492 --> 52:02.411
Carl and Violet
should dress up as condiments.

52:02.494 --> 52:05.539
Condiments? Hmm, Nat,
that's something we should kick around.

52:05.622 --> 52:06.916
That's not the point.

52:06.999 --> 52:10.210
That number got a standing O,
and it's one of Nat's favorites.

52:10.294 --> 52:11.295
If you want to cut it,

52:11.378 --> 52:14.173
you'll have to pry it
out of his cold, dead hands.

52:14.256 --> 52:17.426
I don't think there's any other way
to pry something from Nat.

52:17.509 --> 52:20.637
But, to be clear, no one else
is bothered by these detours?

52:20.721 --> 52:21.764
No.

52:21.847 --> 52:24.308
- If there's nothing else--
- Sorry, the lead girl.

52:24.391 --> 52:26.143
-Can we talk about her?
-Who? Violet?

52:26.226 --> 52:28.103
What do you want?
For her to be less perfect?

52:28.187 --> 52:30.397
-Impossible.
-She was Kinky Boots!

52:30.480 --> 52:33.442
Just the part she plays.
Her character goes from scene to scene,

52:33.525 --> 52:36.236
falling in love with every guy
from a different era.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.864
-So? Sex sells.
-She was Kinky Boots.

52:38.948 --> 52:41.200
She has sex, like, 26 times in the show!

52:41.283 --> 52:43.786
That's a lot of friction.
A fire was gonna start down there.

52:43.869 --> 52:46.580
-I didn't know you were such a prude.
-I'm not a prude.

52:46.663 --> 52:49.624
-You counted how many times she had sex.
-She was Kinky Boots!

52:49.709 --> 52:52.294
-So, everybody likes her? Violet.
-Ouch.

52:52.377 --> 52:55.630
Methinks the town stable
has one mare too many for Lorelai.

52:55.715 --> 52:58.926
-She has a beautiful voice.
-And... she was Kinky Boots!

52:59.009 --> 53:01.887
Babette, I love you, but <i>Kinky Boots</i>
was a show, not a character.

53:01.971 --> 53:04.014
She was in the road show,
not the Broadway show.

53:04.098 --> 53:06.976
And she wasn't Kinky Boots.
She was Trish, the factory worker!

53:07.059 --> 53:08.978
I'm right next to you.
You don't have to yell!

53:09.061 --> 53:10.938
- I'm not yelling.
- Am I yelling?

53:11.021 --> 53:12.439
Look, last thing. Abba?

53:12.522 --> 53:16.902
Ah! Thanks for reminding me.
We all love the Abba songs.

53:16.986 --> 53:21.198
But my attorney warned me that doing
the nine Abba songs at the end

53:21.281 --> 53:23.658
might entangle us
in some messy litigation.

53:23.743 --> 53:27.788
Now, I've got a call in to Benny Andersson
and Björn Ulvaeus of Abba--

53:27.872 --> 53:30.582
-You have their numbers?
-But have yet to hear back.

53:30.665 --> 53:34.128
You know, Taylor...
I've written some songs. Sorry.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.670
No. No, Sophie, go ahead.

53:35.755 --> 53:37.172
I've never done anything with them,

53:37.256 --> 53:40.342
but you can have them for free
to sing at the end, if you like.

53:40.425 --> 53:43.012
Well, that's very nice, Sophie.

53:43.095 --> 53:44.471
Are they catchy?

53:44.554 --> 53:46.849
-I could play one for you.
-Please.

54:05.910 --> 54:07.912
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
Um...

54:07.995 --> 54:09.621
That's not catchy.

54:09.704 --> 54:11.456
Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

54:11.540 --> 54:14.877
Honestly, everyone here
is just throwing encomiums at this thing.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.171
Mondo encomium! It's all swell?

54:17.254 --> 54:18.798
I'm an island?

54:21.175 --> 54:22.259
Guess I'm an island.

54:22.342 --> 54:24.719
And I can just make my reservation.

54:38.067 --> 54:39.526
You don't like me.

54:39.609 --> 54:41.570
Oh, you scared me. Violet.

54:41.653 --> 54:43.280
-You don't like me.
-That's not true.

54:43.363 --> 54:44.907
Why?

54:44.990 --> 54:48.160
Have you ever performed?
Been in a musical? Taken this risk?

54:48.243 --> 54:49.995
No. Well, once.

54:50.079 --> 54:51.997
I was Lucy in
<i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.</i>

54:52.081 --> 54:53.207
I was awful.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.376
Charlie Brown kicked me instead
of the football and the crowd cheered.

54:56.460 --> 54:59.671
So I wasn't Kinky Boots, okay?
I was Trish. It's a featured role.

54:59.754 --> 55:02.299
-It's a great role.
-Well, I went on a lot. In Boston.

55:02.382 --> 55:03.633
Boston's a big-ass town.

55:03.717 --> 55:05.677
- Uh-huh.
- Everybody's a critic.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.596
-Well, it was my job.
-Mm, well.

55:08.513 --> 55:11.934
I got to go. Opening night's in a week.
Thanks for the doubts.

55:12.851 --> 55:15.896
-You're a terrific tap dancer!
-I don't need your validation!

55:16.396 --> 55:17.689
It's quite a find.

55:17.772 --> 55:20.359
It's a hell of a find.
Excuse my language.

55:20.442 --> 55:21.944
Don't you think, Emily?

55:22.027 --> 55:24.279
Oh, yes. Yes, quite a find!

55:24.363 --> 55:27.532
And it was a yard sale.
Not even a thrift shop.

55:27.616 --> 55:31.828
It was at the bottom of a box,
under an old toaster and a broken Slinky.

55:31.912 --> 55:36.541
I'd drop by more yard sales myself,
but you have to step into people's yards.

55:36.625 --> 55:39.836
Oh, with their trampolines
and their "Kiss the Gardener" signs.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.215
With your approval, I would like
to petition the national board

55:43.298 --> 55:45.550
to fund the purchase
of a top-notch display

55:45.634 --> 55:47.887
for the diaries of Abigail Franklin.

55:47.970 --> 55:50.305
-After we authenticate them, right?
-Hmm?

55:50.389 --> 55:53.934
We can't repeat what happened
with the bogus <i>Federalist Papers.</i>

55:54.018 --> 55:56.145
Where the word "Federalist"
was misspelled.

55:56.228 --> 55:58.022
We stopped that check just in time.

55:58.105 --> 56:01.024
Very well, then.
Post-verification. All in favor?

56:02.442 --> 56:05.070
- Excellent. I'll get the process started.
- Hmm.

56:05.154 --> 56:08.073
Emily, these puffs...
Are they crab?

56:08.157 --> 56:09.408
Do they taste like crab?

56:09.491 --> 56:11.160
- I don't know.
- Neither do I.

56:11.243 --> 56:13.412
Berta makes things, and I just eat them.

56:13.495 --> 56:15.122
She doesn't tell you what they are?

56:15.205 --> 56:16.957
Oh, no, she tells me.

56:18.750 --> 56:21.045
Oh, my goodness!
Is it three o'clock already?

56:21.128 --> 56:22.754
-I have a hair appointment.
-Me, too.

56:22.837 --> 56:25.174
-Same here.
-I guess the meeting's adjourned.

56:25.257 --> 56:26.591
-Goodbye, darling.
-Sorry to dash.

56:26.675 --> 56:28.677
- Lovely meeting, dear.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

56:31.846 --> 56:34.808
Well, this is a surprise.
Did I know you were coming?

56:34.891 --> 56:37.561
Did I forget?
Have I officially become an old woman?

56:37.644 --> 56:40.605
No, not you. Never.
I popped by to see if you were home.

56:40.689 --> 56:43.317
No, no, no,
<i>Señora</i> Emily--

56:43.400 --> 56:46.653
Berta no know anything, anything.

56:49.531 --> 56:52.159
They're gonna miss
their hair appointments,

56:52.242 --> 56:53.493
and it's all their fault.

56:54.328 --> 56:55.955
-Uh, Grandma...
-Yes?

56:56.038 --> 56:57.664
There's a TV in here.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.500
Yes, there is.
So would you like something to eat?

57:00.584 --> 57:03.878
I have Berta puffs from today
and some mystery soup from last night.

57:03.963 --> 57:05.089
No, I'm fine.

57:05.172 --> 57:07.549
Grandma, why is there a TV in here?

57:07.632 --> 57:11.553
One of Berta's cousins heard me talking
about a live opera that was coming on,

57:11.636 --> 57:13.138
and it was during dinnertime,

57:13.222 --> 57:15.057
so they brought it down
and set it up for me.

57:15.140 --> 57:17.351
-You ate in the living room?
-Yes.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.228
On this?
It's a Duncan Phyfe!

57:19.311 --> 57:21.438
I didn't eat on the coffee table.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.107
They set this up for me.

57:23.190 --> 57:26.235
- Am I being punk'd?
- You're being dramatic.

57:26.318 --> 57:29.779
Grandma, have you been
getting out of the house at all?

57:29.863 --> 57:31.615
Of course I have.
I'm not a shut-in.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.951
I mean socializing.
Not just running errands.

57:34.034 --> 57:37.079
-Are you getting together with people?
-I was just with the girls.

57:37.162 --> 57:40.082
I don't mean DAR meetings.
Have you been doing anything fun?

57:40.165 --> 57:41.791
Yes, I'm full of fun.

57:41.875 --> 57:44.669
-You were asleep at noon the other day.
-So?

57:44.753 --> 57:46.838
It's not like you.
Do you go to the club?

57:46.922 --> 57:48.340
You and Grandpa loved the club.

57:48.423 --> 57:50.800
I'm not even sure if my membership
is up-to-date.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.886
-Well, renew it.
-Why?

57:52.970 --> 57:56.056
You're too young to be eating
in front of a TV, watching <i>Matlock.</i>

57:56.140 --> 57:59.018
<i>-Matlock</i> isn't on anymore.
-It's in repeats.

57:59.101 --> 58:02.229
I'm watching PBS, not <i>Matlock.</i>
I'm not 90.

58:02.312 --> 58:03.313
That's my point.

58:03.397 --> 58:06.733
Maybe you should go out at night,
mingle, dance a little, have fun.

58:10.445 --> 58:12.697
I should go save the ladies.

58:12.781 --> 58:15.700
Berta, they have to go.
They all have hair appointments.

58:15.784 --> 58:18.162
We had a debate about Andy Griffith.
Alive or dead?

58:18.245 --> 58:19.997
Then we finished off
the finger sandwiches.

58:20.080 --> 58:23.833
Something must have gotten through,
because she actually e-mailed me.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.169
First contact in ages.

58:25.252 --> 58:26.878
<i>She said she would.</i>
<i>What's it about?</i>

58:26.961 --> 58:29.256
Something fun.
Your grandfather's gravestone.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.924
Why would she e-mail you about that?

58:31.008 --> 58:33.843
<i>-There's a new one on the way.</i>
-What happened to the old one?

58:33.927 --> 58:36.138
<i>You mean "ones."</i>
<i>Um... Let's see.</i>

58:36.221 --> 58:38.473
The first one had
the Longfellow quote right,

58:38.557 --> 58:40.975
but without attribution to Longfellow.
Got chucked.

58:41.060 --> 58:42.727
The second one had the attribution,

58:42.811 --> 58:45.355
but she wanted a dash preceding it.
Got chucked.

58:45.439 --> 58:48.483
The third one fell off the delivery truck.
That's not on her.

58:48.567 --> 58:50.610
The fourth one had
the dash and the Longfellow,

58:50.694 --> 58:53.738
but no quotation marks around the quote.
Got chucked.

58:53.822 --> 58:55.449
This is number five.

58:55.532 --> 58:56.866
Does she want us to proof it?

58:56.950 --> 58:59.661
<i>I don't know, Rory.</i>
<i>She just wants us there.</i>

58:59.744 --> 59:00.995
Okay. So we'll go.

59:01.913 --> 59:04.291
<i>Right? Mom?</i>
<i>Grandma asked us.</i>

59:04.374 --> 59:06.918
<i>-We haven't visited the grave in a while.</i>
-I know.

59:07.001 --> 59:08.670
I'm worried about her.

59:08.753 --> 59:10.714
<i>Okay. Fine. We'll go.</i>

59:10.797 --> 59:13.883
-TV tray in the living room.
-Is what I originally named you.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.427
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye.

59:21.933 --> 59:23.185
Rory Gilmore.

59:23.769 --> 59:24.853
Yes, thank you.

59:24.936 --> 59:28.357
We've gotten positive feedback
for putting the poem back on the cover.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.234
They are inspiring.

59:30.317 --> 59:33.570
Yes, I'd say we don't have
our heads up our backsides anymore.

59:33.653 --> 59:35.530
Uh-huh.
Thanks for calling.

59:43.997 --> 59:45.540
No cigar?

59:47.126 --> 59:49.211
I pictured you chomping a fat cigar.

59:49.294 --> 59:51.045
Doctor told me to cut back.

59:53.047 --> 59:56.551
Esther, Charlie, this is Jess.
He's Luke Danes' nephew.

59:56.635 --> 59:57.927
Hello.

59:58.011 --> 1:00:00.389
I remember you, punk.

1:00:00.472 --> 1:00:02.141
Good to see you again, Esther.

1:00:03.057 --> 1:00:04.893
You, too.
What's it been? Four years?

1:00:04.976 --> 1:00:06.686
Maybe more.
When did you get in?

1:00:06.770 --> 1:00:09.856
Just now. I'm meeting Luke.
We've got Mom maintenance to do.

1:00:09.939 --> 1:00:12.859
You hear she and T.J.
accidentally joined some cult?

1:00:12.942 --> 1:00:14.278
And that vegetables were involved.

1:00:14.361 --> 1:00:17.156
-And an eight-million-year contract.
-I heard it was six.

1:00:17.239 --> 1:00:20.617
As editor of the <i>Gazette,</i> you have
better sources than me, Mr. Roundbottom.

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:21.868
What?

1:00:24.078 --> 1:00:27.040
-Oh.
-Can't wait to hear how you got the job.

1:00:27.124 --> 1:00:28.500
It was the usual thing.

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:30.752
I submitted my résumé,
plus samples of my work,

1:00:30.835 --> 1:00:33.672
I was thoroughly vetted,
there were several interviews.

1:00:33.755 --> 1:00:37.634
Plus complex negotiations
over salary, benefits, parking.

1:00:37.717 --> 1:00:39.427
-You asked Taylor?
-Pretty much.

1:00:44.099 --> 1:00:45.976
I don't want him to see me like this.

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:48.019
-It's good to see you.
-You, too.

1:00:48.102 --> 1:00:49.688
-How about some lunch?
-Sure.

1:00:52.232 --> 1:00:54.067
Very Lou Grant.

1:00:54.151 --> 1:00:56.278
Last time I checked,
grain was a food group.

1:01:00.323 --> 1:01:01.950
-Bottoms up.
-Roundbottoms up.

1:01:05.787 --> 1:01:07.080
So, how are you?

1:01:07.164 --> 1:01:10.124
-Luke says the book press is going great.
-It's doing okay.

1:01:10.208 --> 1:01:11.626
Dave Eggers is shaking in his boots?

1:01:11.710 --> 1:01:14.921
If Dave Eggers
even knows we exist, I'd be happy.

1:01:15.004 --> 1:01:16.798
And in other stuff?
Personal life?

1:01:16.881 --> 1:01:19.593
Stable. Nothing permanent.
What about you?

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:20.969
Oh, damn.

1:01:24.055 --> 1:01:26.140
Did you just write "break up with P"?

1:01:26.225 --> 1:01:28.393
How about a second course?

1:01:28.477 --> 1:01:31.188
-Esther, would you get that?
-I'm filing something.

1:01:31.271 --> 1:01:34.023
You've been filing
that same piece of paper for a long time.

1:01:34.107 --> 1:01:36.776
When you started,
Nora Ephron felt good about her neck.

1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:39.070
Do you still want me to get it?

1:01:39.153 --> 1:01:42.115
No.
I could've been a contender.

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:43.992
-You're still a contender.
-Oh yeah?

1:01:45.994 --> 1:01:47.871
I'm broke. Busted.

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:50.916
Beggared. I have no apartment. No car.

1:01:50.999 --> 1:01:53.960
-My license expired three months ago.
-Get out of here.

1:01:54.044 --> 1:01:57.047
Everything I own is in boxes
scattered around three different states.

1:01:57.130 --> 1:02:00.091
I have no job. I have no credit.
I have no underwear.

1:02:00.174 --> 1:02:01.718
-What?
-I can't find that box!

1:02:01.801 --> 1:02:04.471
-Buy some new ones.
-Are you listening, man? I'm broke.

1:02:04.554 --> 1:02:05.680
I'll lend you the money.

1:02:05.764 --> 1:02:07.766
This isn't about you lending me money.

1:02:07.849 --> 1:02:09.684
This is about my life!

1:02:09.768 --> 1:02:11.478
People come up and smell me.

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:13.062
And what are they smelling?

1:02:13.146 --> 1:02:16.525
Failure. Headmaster Charleston
told me to go get my master's

1:02:16.608 --> 1:02:19.236
so that I can teach at Chilton.
He could smell it.

1:02:19.319 --> 1:02:21.738
I went and interviewed
at a website that I hate.

1:02:21.821 --> 1:02:24.741
-They passed. They can smell it.
-No one's smelling anything.

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:26.826
Maybe Paris will let me be a surrogate.

1:02:26.910 --> 1:02:28.953
-She's always liked my teeth.
-Slow down.

1:02:29.037 --> 1:02:30.830
It's probably too late.
I've aged out.

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:35.252
-Stop. This is a rut. It's temporary.
-Or not.

1:02:35.335 --> 1:02:37.462
You're a writer.
Ruts are normal.

1:02:37.546 --> 1:02:39.589
My friend Doyle's a Hollywood writer now.

1:02:39.673 --> 1:02:43.301
-He's telling me to write a spec script.
-You're not writing a spec script.

1:02:43.385 --> 1:02:46.305
He gave me a copy of
<i>The Mysteries of Laura.</i> Is that a show?

1:02:46.388 --> 1:02:49.140
You need to write something
that you're passionate about.

1:02:49.223 --> 1:02:53.061
What is that foreign concept you speak of?
"Passion"? Is that really a thing?

1:02:53.144 --> 1:02:56.690
Find the thing that makes
you feel, so that your readers feel it.

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:59.276
-What makes you feel?
-Did I tell you I lost my wallet?

1:03:02.236 --> 1:03:03.280
You should write a book.

1:03:03.363 --> 1:03:05.740
Ugh, thanks for
the Naomi Shropshire flashbacks.

1:03:05.824 --> 1:03:06.866
Lovely.

1:03:06.950 --> 1:03:09.035
- I know what you should write.
- What?

1:03:09.118 --> 1:03:10.454
Write about you and your mom.

1:03:11.538 --> 1:03:13.290
-What?
-It's a cool story.

1:03:13.373 --> 1:03:16.167
It's got a point of view.
It's something only you can write.

1:03:18.545 --> 1:03:19.588
Think about it.

1:03:22.299 --> 1:03:23.550
I gotta go.

1:03:26.636 --> 1:03:27.804
Thanks for lunch.

1:04:24.444 --> 1:04:26.946
- Thanks, guys. Looks great.
- Okay.

1:04:31.034 --> 1:04:32.911
Hello, Lorelai.

1:04:32.994 --> 1:04:34.037
Hi.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:35.914
They are waiting
for you on the patio.

1:04:35.997 --> 1:04:37.624
Lots of things going on here.

1:04:38.542 --> 1:04:41.961
The cousins are here and they have
their own ladders. It's exciting.

1:04:42.045 --> 1:04:46.174
Mrs. Gilmore is so kind,
the nicest woman I've ever met...

1:04:46.257 --> 1:04:47.426
They're right outside.

1:04:47.509 --> 1:04:49.260
-Thank you.
-Uh-huh.

1:04:49.343 --> 1:04:51.262
Hi, sorry I'm late.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:54.348
Hello.

1:04:54.433 --> 1:04:57.226
-Hello, there.
-Jack, this is my daughter, Lorelai.

1:04:57.310 --> 1:04:58.853
Lorelai, this is Jack Smith.

1:04:59.563 --> 1:05:00.980
Hi. Oh.

1:05:01.064 --> 1:05:02.982
-Nice to meet you.
-We've met.

1:05:03.066 --> 1:05:04.192
-Have we?
-Mm-hmm.

1:05:04.275 --> 1:05:07.821
-At Richard's service. Jack spoke.
-I was a good friend of your father's.

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:09.948
Spent many an hour with him
on the golf course.

1:05:10.031 --> 1:05:12.241
-Mmm. Yes.
-Great man.

1:05:12.325 --> 1:05:14.285
He was a golf player.
Great.

1:05:14.368 --> 1:05:16.580
-He was a great golf man.
-Sit down, ladies.

1:05:17.831 --> 1:05:20.374
I made a pitcher of gimlets
with a vodka...

1:05:21.292 --> 1:05:24.128
I brought back from Russia.
It's wonderful.

1:05:24.212 --> 1:05:26.840
- Want to try some?
- Sure.

1:05:28.382 --> 1:05:30.009
Rory didn't come with you?

1:05:30.093 --> 1:05:31.720
-Lorelai?
-Me?

1:05:31.803 --> 1:05:35.724
- Yes, you.
- Uh, she's coming separately.

1:05:35.807 --> 1:05:38.435
Jack has offered
to drive us all to the cemetery.

1:05:38.518 --> 1:05:39.519
How nice of him.

1:05:39.603 --> 1:05:42.396
Well, it's a hard day.
You know, I just want to help.

1:05:42.481 --> 1:05:44.649
Here you are, ladies.
Enjoy.

1:05:44.733 --> 1:05:46.067
Thank you, Jack.

1:05:46.776 --> 1:05:49.237
So, who are you?
I...

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:51.698
Or, what, where, how do...

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:53.199
What do you do, Jack?

1:05:53.282 --> 1:05:56.285
Well, I'm mostly retired.
Venture capital.

1:05:56.369 --> 1:05:59.080
I go into the office every now and then.
They hide from me.

1:06:00.582 --> 1:06:03.960
And what is the... the... but...

1:06:04.043 --> 1:06:06.087
the... the blank...

1:06:06.171 --> 1:06:08.089
-blank...
-Yes?

1:06:08.590 --> 1:06:10.133
Uh, it just flew out of my head.

1:06:10.216 --> 1:06:13.720
-Is your drink all right?
-Oh, yeah. It's very gimlety.

1:06:13.803 --> 1:06:17.265
I'm thirsty. Parched.
I'm gonna grab some sparkling water.

1:06:17.348 --> 1:06:18.892
-Ah, I'll get it.
-Oh, no, that's okay.

1:06:18.975 --> 1:06:21.895
You stay there, Jack.
I'll, um, bring some for all of us.

1:06:21.978 --> 1:06:24.022
-You'll be right back?
-I'll be right back.

1:06:31.404 --> 1:06:32.906
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

1:06:32.989 --> 1:06:35.659
Oh, hey. I'm at the <i>Gazette.</i>
I lost track of time.

1:06:35.742 --> 1:06:38.411
Stop the presses,
because I've got your new lead story.

1:06:38.495 --> 1:06:39.788
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1:06:39.871 --> 1:06:42.541
Your grandmother better buy
herself a new TV tray.

1:06:42.624 --> 1:06:44.250
-What?
<i>-She has a boyfriend.</i>

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:46.044
-No.
<i>-Ugh, Jack.</i>

1:06:46.127 --> 1:06:48.087
Jack Smith. New Daddy Jack.

1:06:48.171 --> 1:06:50.339
I'll put you on speaker.
I have to google something.

1:06:50.423 --> 1:06:52.383
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>He can't be her boyfriend.</i>

1:06:52.466 --> 1:06:55.136
Well, he's struttin' around like he is.

1:06:55.219 --> 1:06:59.432
Sitting next to her, all cozy,
mixing cocktails at Dad's drink cart.

1:06:59.516 --> 1:07:02.644
<i>-The patio cart or the living room cart?</i>
-The patio cart.

1:07:02.727 --> 1:07:05.396
-Oh well, that's not so bad.
<i>-How is that not so bad?</i>

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:09.025
The patio cart's an auxiliary. I associate
Grandpa with the living room cart.

1:07:09.108 --> 1:07:13.822
Dad used both carts!
I associate both with my departed father.

1:07:13.905 --> 1:07:17.283
Oh, great.
There's 54 million Jack Smiths.

1:07:17.366 --> 1:07:19.578
<i>-Of course that's his name.</i>
-Add Connecticut to it.

1:07:19.661 --> 1:07:21.412
Yeah, got it down to two million.

1:07:21.495 --> 1:07:23.540
Jack is short for John.
Search John Smith.

1:07:23.623 --> 1:07:25.166
Now my phone's just laughing at me.

1:07:25.249 --> 1:07:28.127
-Where does she know him from?
<i>-The club.</i>

1:07:28.211 --> 1:07:31.464
-Oh, she went back to the club?
<i>-And he was at Dad's funeral.</i>

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:33.424
Dad wasn't even in the ground,

1:07:33.507 --> 1:07:37.511
and Jack was there,
spraying his scent all over Mom.

1:07:37.596 --> 1:07:40.348
I am in shock.
Are you in shock?

1:07:40.431 --> 1:07:41.933
Yeah, I'm in shock.

1:07:42.016 --> 1:07:44.894
<i>I thought she'd sworn off the club.</i>
<i>She hasn't been there in ages.</i>

1:07:44.978 --> 1:07:47.647
Well, I may have
encouraged her to go back.

1:07:47.731 --> 1:07:49.273
<i>-To the club?</i>
-Yes.

1:07:49.357 --> 1:07:51.735
-You pimped out my mother?
<i>-I didn't pimp her out.</i>

1:07:51.818 --> 1:07:53.486
She was getting very isolated.

1:07:53.570 --> 1:07:55.780
You sent a vulnerable, wounded turtle

1:07:55.864 --> 1:07:58.491
into a nest
of horny, gray-haired honey badgers.

1:07:58.575 --> 1:08:01.369
-I thought she would play backgammon!
<i>-Now, thanks to you,</i>

1:08:01.452 --> 1:08:03.913
she's out there sipping a gimlet
with Jack the Zipper.

1:08:03.997 --> 1:08:05.039
You're missing this.

1:08:05.123 --> 1:08:06.958
I told Grandma
I'd meet you at the cemetery.

1:08:07.041 --> 1:08:08.334
I'm working on something.

1:08:08.918 --> 1:08:10.086
Oh, what is it?

1:08:10.169 --> 1:08:12.380
It's a surprise. I... I'm excited.

1:08:12.463 --> 1:08:14.924
-I want to tell you in person.
-Good. I want to hear something

1:08:15.008 --> 1:08:16.009
that won't make me queasy.

1:08:16.092 --> 1:08:17.426
-Lorelai.
-I gotta go.

1:08:17.510 --> 1:08:19.679
-Oh, uh, we'll see you later.
<i>-Bye.</i>

1:08:19.763 --> 1:08:22.098
Rory's gonna meet us at the cemetery.

1:08:22.181 --> 1:08:24.684
Do you have a problem?

1:08:24.768 --> 1:08:27.687
-I mean, who is this guy, Mom?
-Jack Smith.

1:08:27.771 --> 1:08:29.522
What do you know
about this Jack Smith?

1:08:29.606 --> 1:08:31.900
I know everything.
We've been friends for 30 years.

1:08:31.983 --> 1:08:33.442
Friends, huh?

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:35.612
Playing some golf,
sipping bub at the club?

1:08:35.695 --> 1:08:38.156
-What are you babbling about?
-You don't know him.

1:08:38.239 --> 1:08:40.241
-Oh, for Pete's sake.
-I mean, what is he after?

1:08:40.324 --> 1:08:41.325
Nothing. Why?

1:08:41.409 --> 1:08:43.828
-I ain't saying he's a gold digger.
-Lorelai--

1:08:43.912 --> 1:08:45.789
Mom, you're a catch.
You're vulnerable.

1:08:45.872 --> 1:08:47.624
-You have money.
-He has more.

1:08:47.707 --> 1:08:49.208
I ain't saying you're a gold digger.

1:08:49.292 --> 1:08:51.836
Jack is a widower and we are friends.

1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:54.213
-I can't have friends?
-Of course you can.

1:08:54.297 --> 1:08:55.798
Friends are for other people?

1:08:55.882 --> 1:08:59.052
It's just weird to see him here.
I'm processing.

1:08:59.135 --> 1:09:03.932
Maybe it's good.
Maybe it's good... that you're moving on.

1:09:04.515 --> 1:09:06.809
Oh, I see.
It's good that I'm moving on

1:09:06.893 --> 1:09:08.770
-because now I'm someone else's problem.
-What?

1:09:08.853 --> 1:09:12.106
You won't have to worry about me
because now I have a man in my life.

1:09:12.190 --> 1:09:15.068
-I didn't say that.
-You're released from all responsibility.

1:09:15.151 --> 1:09:17.070
-I didn't--
-You've forgotten about your father?

1:09:17.153 --> 1:09:18.362
Help me with the segues here.

1:09:18.446 --> 1:09:21.074
I'm not dismissing Richard
by spending time with Jack.

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:22.909
I'm not just moving on.

1:09:22.992 --> 1:09:25.745
Okay. I didn't...

1:09:25.829 --> 1:09:30.333
Let's not leave Jack
and the auxiliary cart waiting out there.

1:09:30.416 --> 1:09:32.251
Where's Luke today?

1:09:32.335 --> 1:09:33.837
I'm never skipping breakfast again.

1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:36.380
Is he going to call me
about that real estate we saw?

1:09:36.464 --> 1:09:37.548
What real estate?

1:09:37.631 --> 1:09:41.469
I took that "partner" of yours
to look at potential franchise locations.

1:09:41.552 --> 1:09:43.512
It was your father's dying wish.

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:46.432
-He wanted to give Luke a leg up.
-Luke does not need a leg up.

1:09:46.515 --> 1:09:48.142
I spent half a day with him.

1:09:48.226 --> 1:09:51.062
Nice to know he doesn't mind
wasting a grieving widow's time.

1:09:51.145 --> 1:09:53.564
-When was this?
-He didn't tell you?

1:09:53.647 --> 1:09:54.858
Yes, he did.

1:09:54.941 --> 1:09:56.985
Do you and that partner of yours
even talk?

1:09:57.068 --> 1:09:59.987
-Yes, always. Constantly.
-Could have fooled me.

1:10:03.992 --> 1:10:04.993
We need to go.

1:10:06.035 --> 1:10:07.746
Jack, we should be going.

1:10:23.636 --> 1:10:26.389
-So, that's the honey badger?
-That's him.

1:10:26.472 --> 1:10:28.516
-How was the drive?
-Cologne-scented.

1:10:29.475 --> 1:10:31.019
- Hello, honey.
- Hi, Grandma.

1:10:31.102 --> 1:10:33.521
Jack is gonna wait for us in the car.
Shall we?

1:10:33.604 --> 1:10:35.398
Yeah. Okay.

1:10:45.158 --> 1:10:47.118
I thought we took a left
at the Gundersons.

1:10:47.201 --> 1:10:51.080
-I thought it was a right at the Turners.
-I know the way.

1:10:51.164 --> 1:10:52.540
Stanley.

1:10:52.623 --> 1:10:55.001
Good afternoon, Mrs. Gilmore and ladies.

1:10:55.084 --> 1:10:57.837
- Hi.
- Hello. Are we all set here?

1:10:57.921 --> 1:10:59.088
Yes, we are.

1:11:00.631 --> 1:11:02.633
It was newly polished this morning.

1:11:02.716 --> 1:11:04.510
The coal gray is just the right shade,

1:11:04.593 --> 1:11:06.637
there's a dash
in front of the Longfellow--

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.681
-There are single quotation marks.
-Here we go.

1:11:08.765 --> 1:11:11.225
It was supposed to be
double quotation marks.

1:11:11.309 --> 1:11:12.393
Of course it was.

1:11:12.476 --> 1:11:15.104
It was always correct before this.
Why would you change it?

1:11:15.188 --> 1:11:17.190
I am going to look into this.

1:11:17.273 --> 1:11:20.443
I'm coming with you. This is ridiculous.
This is the fourth one.

1:11:20.526 --> 1:11:21.861
-Fifth.
-Stay here.

1:11:21.945 --> 1:11:22.946
-Okay.
-Sure.

1:11:23.029 --> 1:11:26.699
We can get someone on-site
to carve them into double quotation marks.

1:11:26.783 --> 1:11:29.410
Five stones and five mistakes.
What is going on here?

1:11:29.493 --> 1:11:31.537
The third one
did fall off the truck.

1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:35.124
-I think the single quotes look fine.
-Let her have what she wants.

1:11:35.208 --> 1:11:37.043
Grandma's still got your back, Grandpa.

1:11:38.211 --> 1:11:40.546
Well, this gives me
a chance to fix his flowers.

1:11:43.091 --> 1:11:44.300
You take these.

1:11:45.593 --> 1:11:48.096
So, what do you think of Queens?

1:11:48.179 --> 1:11:50.389
The monarch or the guys
who are fun to hang out with?

1:11:50.473 --> 1:11:51.808
The borough.

1:11:51.891 --> 1:11:53.517
I've been looking at apartments.

1:11:53.601 --> 1:11:55.812
I think I'm gonna try Queens.
It's the hot place.

1:11:55.895 --> 1:11:57.480
-What about Brooklyn?
-Brooklyn's done.

1:11:57.563 --> 1:12:00.108
-Oh, I'm so behind.
-You get more space in Queens.

1:12:00.191 --> 1:12:02.401
I want a bedroom
and a dedicated writing space,

1:12:02.485 --> 1:12:03.569
especially since--

1:12:03.652 --> 1:12:06.655
Is this the top-secret
Manhattan Project you've been working on?

1:12:06.739 --> 1:12:09.492
-Could be.
-Ooh, happy news. Tell, tell.

1:12:09.575 --> 1:12:11.828
Well, it's a book.

1:12:11.911 --> 1:12:12.996
-You bought one?
-No.

1:12:13.079 --> 1:12:14.538
-Borrowed one? Burned one?
-No. No.

1:12:14.622 --> 1:12:15.999
I'm writing a book.

1:12:16.082 --> 1:12:17.959
Really?
Nutty Naomi changed her mind?

1:12:18.042 --> 1:12:19.668
Oh, no, I'm writing this solo.

1:12:19.752 --> 1:12:22.088
-No crazy collaborators.
-Wow!

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:23.297
I know, right?

1:12:23.381 --> 1:12:25.216
So, what's it about?
I'm dying to hear.

1:12:25.299 --> 1:12:26.717
Sorry, just an expression.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:29.553
Is it a love story? A mystery?

1:12:29.637 --> 1:12:32.932
A feel-good puppy, kitten, pony, raccoon
travel across country

1:12:33.016 --> 1:12:35.601
-to enter a cow in the county fair story?
-It's non-fiction.

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:38.104
So is the puppy, kitten, pony,
raccoon, cow county fair caper.

1:12:38.187 --> 1:12:42.108
No animals, no capers.
It's about me and you.

1:12:44.027 --> 1:12:45.862
-Me and you?
-Yes.

1:12:46.779 --> 1:12:50.909
- And do we fight crime?
- It's about our relationship.

1:12:50.992 --> 1:12:53.744
Our mother-daughter thing.
The friend thing.

1:12:53.827 --> 1:12:57.081
It's our journey, and the journey
you took before I was born.

1:12:58.207 --> 1:12:59.292
Hmm.

1:13:01.252 --> 1:13:04.047
Maybe I glossed over it too much.

1:13:04.130 --> 1:13:06.007
Just... picture this.

1:13:06.090 --> 1:13:07.550
It starts.

1:13:07.633 --> 1:13:10.053
You're 16, you're pregnant.

1:13:10.136 --> 1:13:12.805
You're packing up
to leave Grandma's house.

1:13:12.889 --> 1:13:16.517
It's a riches-to-rags story.
It's got everything.

1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:19.395
Family struggle, class warfare,
the independent woman thing.

1:13:19.478 --> 1:13:21.647
From there,
I'll tell the story chronologically,

1:13:21.730 --> 1:13:24.733
or jump back and forth a bit.
I haven't decided yet, but--

1:13:24.817 --> 1:13:27.320
-No.
-What do you mean, "no"?

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:30.156
-No, I don't want you to write that.
-You don't understand.

1:13:30.239 --> 1:13:32.158
-Let me pitch it again.
-I get it. No.

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:34.702
-Why?
-Because it's my life.

1:13:34.785 --> 1:13:37.246
-It's our life.
-You write your side of it.

1:13:37.330 --> 1:13:38.915
-My side.
-Yeah.

1:13:39.082 --> 1:13:41.334
And who would I be talking to?

1:13:41.417 --> 1:13:44.003
I don't know, Mrs. Muir.
Find a ghost.

1:13:44.087 --> 1:13:47.924
-Mom, come on. I have to do this.
-You don't have my permission.

1:13:48.007 --> 1:13:50.969
-We should go somewhere else.
-The dead don't have ears.

1:13:51.052 --> 1:13:53.512
But there are people behind us.

1:13:53.596 --> 1:13:55.348
Where is this coming from?
What inspired you?

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:57.100
I was frustrated.
I was talking to Jess--

1:13:57.183 --> 1:13:59.018
Jess? How the hell did he get into this?

1:13:59.102 --> 1:14:00.894
-He was here visiting Luke.
-Oh, great.

1:14:00.979 --> 1:14:03.856
I'm looking forward to Jess' take on me.
That's terrific.

1:14:03.940 --> 1:14:05.358
It's not his take on you.

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:07.235
-Sorry, kid. Write about something else.
-No.

1:14:07.318 --> 1:14:08.361
About your relationships.

1:14:08.444 --> 1:14:10.446
-You and Jess and Dean.
-They'll be in it, too.

1:14:10.529 --> 1:14:13.115
Don't forget to include Logan,
the guy you just can't quit.

1:14:13.199 --> 1:14:15.660
-It's not fair.
-It's my life, Rory.

1:14:16.285 --> 1:14:18.704
I went to all this effort
for many, many years,

1:14:18.787 --> 1:14:21.040
making sure people only knew
what I wanted them to.

1:14:21.123 --> 1:14:24.251
Now you're gonna put it all in a book?
I don't want my mother finding out

1:14:24.335 --> 1:14:27.129
I left you in a bucket
in a hardware store in chapter six.

1:14:27.213 --> 1:14:29.340
-Are you kidding me?
-You're 32 years old.

1:14:29.423 --> 1:14:31.800
She'll still petition the court
to have you taken away.

1:14:31.884 --> 1:14:33.594
This is such an overreaction.

1:14:33.677 --> 1:14:37.390
Really? Do you know that your grandmother
called you Susan until you were two?

1:14:37.473 --> 1:14:38.349
She did not.

1:14:38.432 --> 1:14:40.768
Write a book about that,
a woman who leaves a baby

1:14:40.851 --> 1:14:43.021
in a bucket and her own mother
takes her to court.

1:14:43.104 --> 1:14:45.606
It's a perfect Lifetime movie.
Maggie Smith can play the mother.

1:14:45.689 --> 1:14:48.234
-Mom, come on.
-You didn't think this through, kid.

1:14:48.317 --> 1:14:52.071
No, I did think this through.
I am not a kid. This was not a whim.

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:55.158
Last night I outlined
the first five chapters just like that.

1:14:55.241 --> 1:14:56.993
-That's a sign.
-What sign?

1:14:57.076 --> 1:14:59.203
That this is it.
This is what I am supposed to do.

1:14:59.287 --> 1:15:00.621
No.

1:15:00.704 --> 1:15:02.623
I'm sorry. I have to.

1:15:02.706 --> 1:15:06.669
Without this, it's grad school
or groveling for jobs that I don't want.

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:07.795
Find another subject.

1:15:07.878 --> 1:15:10.839
So I shouldn't do something
that could change my future

1:15:10.923 --> 1:15:13.717
because you don't want Grandma
to know you left me in a bucket.

1:15:13.801 --> 1:15:15.094
That's what this boils down to?

1:15:15.178 --> 1:15:17.388
-More or less.
-But you did leave me in a bucket!

1:15:17.471 --> 1:15:19.307
You know what?
Do whatever you want, Rory.

1:15:19.390 --> 1:15:21.142
You're a big girl. I can't stop you.

1:15:21.225 --> 1:15:24.562
No, that's not how you and I work.
We don't do passive-aggressive.

1:15:24.645 --> 1:15:27.856
That's how you and your mother work.
You should be on my side.

1:15:27.940 --> 1:15:30.359
I need this.
Can't you understand that?

1:15:30.443 --> 1:15:33.446
I understand.
I always understand.

1:15:34.155 --> 1:15:37.700
For the last 32 years,
I have been the queen of understanding.

1:15:37.783 --> 1:15:40.244
Mom, stop.
Please, give me this.

1:15:40.328 --> 1:15:42.496
I can't. Not this time.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:47.668
Tell Grandma
that I will check in on her later.

1:15:48.669 --> 1:15:50.379
So much for the happy news!

1:16:08.147 --> 1:16:11.192
-Hey.
-Hey. How did it go today?

1:16:11.275 --> 1:16:12.985
We're hoping number six
will be the charm.

1:16:13.069 --> 1:16:14.778
-What?
-Ugh, no coffee?

1:16:14.862 --> 1:16:18.116
No, these people are leaving.

1:16:18.199 --> 1:16:20.033
-They're not having coffee.
-I want coffee.

1:16:20.118 --> 1:16:22.245
You'll make a pot and drink a cup.
It's a waste.

1:16:22.328 --> 1:16:24.788
-I'll drink the whole pot.
-You're not gonna do that.

1:16:24.872 --> 1:16:27.875
So, I'll get a doggy bag
and take the leftover coffee home.

1:16:27.958 --> 1:16:29.543
-What's the problem?
-I'm just saying--

1:16:29.627 --> 1:16:31.087
-Is the world out of coffee?
-No.

1:16:31.170 --> 1:16:33.339
Is Colombia pissed
over <i>Narcos</i> and holding out?

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:34.715
Fine.

1:16:34.798 --> 1:16:36.467
How much longer
are you gonna be like this?

1:16:36.550 --> 1:16:37.885
-What?
-You've been grumpy.

1:16:37.968 --> 1:16:39.387
-No, I haven't.
-Yes, you have.

1:16:39.470 --> 1:16:41.222
-Can we talk at home?
-This is home.

1:16:41.305 --> 1:16:43.182
Come on.
I'm just trying to work here.

1:16:43.266 --> 1:16:46.227
Why didn't you tell me you looked
for franchise locations?

1:16:46.310 --> 1:16:47.770
Is that something someone hides?

1:16:47.853 --> 1:16:49.980
I was caught out today.
I don't like that.

1:16:50.063 --> 1:16:51.857
-Oh, you don't like being caught out?
-Yes.

1:16:51.941 --> 1:16:54.443
Why didn't you tell me
you weren't going to therapy anymore?

1:16:56.154 --> 1:16:57.821
-I don't know.
-Why'd you hide it?

1:16:57.905 --> 1:16:59.907
-I don't know.
-She hasn't been going for a while.

1:16:59.990 --> 1:17:01.075
-That's what she said.
-Yes.

1:17:01.159 --> 1:17:03.619
So where have you been?
If you guys aren't doing therapy,

1:17:03.702 --> 1:17:07.290
where are you on those days
you say you're in therapy?

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:09.958
-I was still going.
-You're still going.

1:17:10.042 --> 1:17:12.336
-By myself.
-Oh, okay. Yeah.

1:17:12.419 --> 1:17:13.921
-You don't believe me?
-I believe you.

1:17:14.004 --> 1:17:16.590
-Uh, Luke.
-I don't know, okay? I don't know.

1:17:16.674 --> 1:17:18.301
Where do you think I was?

1:17:18.384 --> 1:17:21.804
Having a hot affair
at 10:30 every Tuesday morning?

1:17:21.887 --> 1:17:23.222
That's early for a nooner.

1:17:23.306 --> 1:17:27.143
Let's see. Who could it be with?
Uh, maybe the morning food delivery guy?

1:17:27.226 --> 1:17:29.603
Or Lou, the guy who wears a wool cap
even in summer?

1:17:29.687 --> 1:17:31.897
I don't know who that is.
I don't know anything.

1:17:31.980 --> 1:17:33.065
I'm not having an affair.

1:17:33.149 --> 1:17:35.151
Of course not.
You're going to therapy by yourself.

1:17:35.234 --> 1:17:37.361
I mean, your mother dragged you into it,

1:17:37.445 --> 1:17:39.905
but then you fell in love with it
and you threw her out.

1:17:39.988 --> 1:17:42.366
Makes perfect sense.
Can I get you anything else?

1:17:42.450 --> 1:17:44.868
-I'd actually like a little coffee.
-Oh, for the love of...

1:17:44.952 --> 1:17:47.830
-You don't believe me?
-I don't know what to believe.

1:17:47.913 --> 1:17:50.791
You want to call my mother
and have her confirm the story?

1:17:50.874 --> 1:17:53.211
No! I don't want to call your mother.

1:17:53.294 --> 1:17:55.087
I don't call your mother.

1:17:55.171 --> 1:17:57.465
-You know, we struck a deal.
-What deal?

1:17:57.548 --> 1:17:59.132
You've got your life,
and I've got mine.

1:17:59.217 --> 1:18:02.553
You keep your crazy family away from me
and I'll keep mine away from you!

1:18:02.636 --> 1:18:05.306
Really? That's the way it is?

1:18:05.389 --> 1:18:08.309
That's how two people
who are partners are supposed to be?

1:18:08.392 --> 1:18:10.603
What the hell is this?
What is going on here?

1:18:10.686 --> 1:18:12.688
Why is everything so separate with us?

1:18:12.771 --> 1:18:14.565
How the hell would I know?
You set it up.

1:18:14.648 --> 1:18:15.774
-What?
-Yeah.

1:18:15.858 --> 1:18:18.569
Our lives were set up by you.
I just went along with it.

1:18:18.652 --> 1:18:20.488
How the hell did that happen?

1:18:20.571 --> 1:18:21.947
I don't know. Ask your therapist!

1:18:22.030 --> 1:18:25.368
My therapist is understudying the lead
in the moronic musical!

1:18:25.451 --> 1:18:26.577
I'm done with my therapist.

1:18:26.660 --> 1:18:29.330
You set it up,
and I went along, and that's how it works.

1:18:29.413 --> 1:18:31.249
Now we're in the middle
of my diner, arguing,

1:18:31.332 --> 1:18:33.792
and everybody's going outside
with their food and drinks.

1:18:33.876 --> 1:18:35.294
-Where are you going?
-Where?

1:18:35.378 --> 1:18:37.796
I've got muffins in the oven
at the inn for tomorrow

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:41.049
because Sandra Lee canceled
because she talked to Ina Garten,

1:18:41.133 --> 1:18:43.219
who said, "Don't go to the Dragonfly Inn.
It's awful!"

1:18:43.302 --> 1:18:47.306
Sandra's had a tough couple of years.
She doesn't need to be embarrassed by you!

1:18:48.432 --> 1:18:50.809
It's on the house tonight.
Go! Go!

1:18:52.603 --> 1:18:53.979
<i>She was unbelievable.</i>

1:18:54.062 --> 1:18:57.400
Right out of left field,
crazy Lorelai face appears.

1:18:57.483 --> 1:18:58.609
I've seen it before,

1:18:58.692 --> 1:19:01.153
but only when somebody
cuts off her car or at a shoe sale.

1:19:01.237 --> 1:19:03.822
I saw it when Marla Tipton's mom
called you illegitimate.

1:19:03.906 --> 1:19:06.825
She winged those brownie bites
at her with scary accuracy.

1:19:06.909 --> 1:19:09.537
A book.
She totally freaked out over a book.

1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:11.955
-So weird.
-She knows I'm a writer.

1:19:12.039 --> 1:19:14.542
She knows everything is fodder.
Write what you know.

1:19:14.625 --> 1:19:16.502
-You know what I know.
-Lorelai?

1:19:16.585 --> 1:19:20.881
Lorelai, yes. And me. And our life.
I know that crap like the back of my hand.

1:19:20.964 --> 1:19:23.216
She just wouldn't listen.

1:19:24.051 --> 1:19:25.344
Hello?

1:19:25.428 --> 1:19:26.929
-What?
-I just called Logan.

1:19:27.012 --> 1:19:28.431
-What? Why?
-I don't know.

1:19:28.514 --> 1:19:30.641
It just happened.
Like a reflex.

1:19:30.724 --> 1:19:34.562
Oh, my God. This is what I do.
I get upset and I call Logan.

1:19:34.645 --> 1:19:37.731
Well, what I used to do,
because now she might answer.

1:19:37.815 --> 1:19:39.233
She answers his cell?

1:19:39.317 --> 1:19:41.694
-Hello? Rory?
-Crap! I did it again.

1:19:41.777 --> 1:19:43.821
- Are you kidding?
- No.

1:19:43.904 --> 1:19:46.114
Dial 911. I'm going insane.

1:19:46.198 --> 1:19:47.575
This is who I am now?

1:19:47.658 --> 1:19:50.786
That person you knew in your youth,
who was smart and together,

1:19:50.869 --> 1:19:53.414
she's been chewed up and spit out.
You'll never see her again--

1:19:53.497 --> 1:19:55.332
<i> What is going on?</i>

1:19:55.416 --> 1:19:58.127
-Ah! Damn it!
-Oh. Look, okay, you need to relax.

1:19:58.210 --> 1:20:00.921
-You want a Lipitor? Zach got some.
-No, I don't need it.

1:20:01.004 --> 1:20:02.840
I need to be 20 again.

1:20:02.923 --> 1:20:06.635
You should have seen us yesterday.
It was so awful.

1:20:06.719 --> 1:20:10.306
We were just in the middle
of a cemetery, yelling at each other.

1:20:10.389 --> 1:20:12.182
There were mourners all around us.

1:20:12.265 --> 1:20:14.477
Well, their day wasn't so fun anyway.

1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:17.438
-What am I gonna do?
-Well, she'll calm down.

1:20:18.981 --> 1:20:21.274
She looked at me
the way she looks at Grandma.

1:20:21.359 --> 1:20:24.612
- That hurt.
- And, I mean...

1:20:24.695 --> 1:20:26.238
I don't know what I was thinking.

1:20:26.322 --> 1:20:29.658
I mean, of course she wouldn't
want me to write about us.

1:20:29.742 --> 1:20:34.079
I just... I couldn't acknowledge
it because I want to do this so badly.

1:20:34.163 --> 1:20:36.206
-I'm exhausted.
-Hey.

1:20:36.957 --> 1:20:38.542
-Yeah?
-Am I in this book?

1:20:38.626 --> 1:20:40.461
Oh, don't start.

1:20:40.544 --> 1:20:42.338
- Of course.
- No, I got it.

1:20:42.421 --> 1:20:44.297
-No, Lane.
-Hey, stop calling.

1:20:44.382 --> 1:20:46.049
What? She's calling me.

1:20:46.133 --> 1:20:47.885
It's a reflex and we're gonna kick it.

1:20:47.968 --> 1:20:50.053
We've got Lipitor,
so you won't hear from her again.

1:20:50.137 --> 1:20:51.221
Just put her on the phone.

1:20:51.305 --> 1:20:52.639
- <i>No.</i>
<i>- Give me the phone.</i>

1:20:52.723 --> 1:20:54.892
-No. I'm protecting you for some reason.
-It's okay.

1:20:55.809 --> 1:20:56.810
Okay.

1:20:59.021 --> 1:21:01.189
-Hey.
<i>-What is going on?</i>

1:21:01.273 --> 1:21:02.650
Nothing. Bad day.

1:21:02.733 --> 1:21:04.568
Yeah, I heard about
the cholesterol problem.

1:21:04.652 --> 1:21:07.320
Come on, Ace.

1:21:07.405 --> 1:21:09.990
You called me a bunch today
and four times last night.

1:21:10.073 --> 1:21:11.742
You hung up every time.
What is it?

1:21:11.825 --> 1:21:14.495
Nothing.
I had a thing with my mom.

1:21:14.578 --> 1:21:16.205
Well, talk to me. I'm here.

1:21:16.288 --> 1:21:19.625
I was just upset at her
and I was needing to vent,

1:21:19.708 --> 1:21:22.586
and I realized I can't call you anymore.

1:21:22.670 --> 1:21:23.712
Why?

1:21:23.796 --> 1:21:26.465
- Logan!
- I gotta take this outside.

1:21:26.549 --> 1:21:28.133
<i>Because she's there.</i>

1:21:28.216 --> 1:21:29.885
Rory...

1:21:29.968 --> 1:21:30.969
She's there.

1:21:31.887 --> 1:21:34.222
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- That's why.

1:21:35.849 --> 1:21:38.936
So, I guess we should say goodbye.

1:21:39.019 --> 1:21:41.229
-If that's what you want.
-Don't make this my thing.

1:21:41.313 --> 1:21:43.356
-Sorry.
<i>-So that's it?</i>

1:21:43.441 --> 1:21:44.692
We're breaking up.

1:21:45.734 --> 1:21:48.821
Except we can't break up...
because we're nothing.

1:21:57.871 --> 1:22:01.500
- God.
- This adult stuff is hard, isn't it?

1:22:02.626 --> 1:22:06.714
I wonder if the Thirtysomething Gang
goes through crap like this.

1:22:11.802 --> 1:22:13.345
<i>Lorelai, it's Taylor.</i>

1:22:13.429 --> 1:22:16.014
<i>You're probably not interested</i>
<i>in the musical anymore,</i>

1:22:16.098 --> 1:22:18.266
<i>but out of politeness,</i>
<i>I'm letting you know</i>

1:22:18.350 --> 1:22:22.688
<i>that Nat Compton and I</i>
<i>went on retreat to Cape Cod last weekend,</i>

1:22:22.771 --> 1:22:24.648
<i>and we've come up with a new song.</i>

1:22:24.732 --> 1:22:27.025
<i>I'm inviting everyone</i>
<i>on the advisory committee</i>

1:22:27.109 --> 1:22:29.528
<i>to come by Miss Patty's tonight</i>
<i>and give it a listen.</i>

1:22:29.612 --> 1:22:32.906
<i>But please, please...</i>
<i>leave the 'tude at home.</i>

1:24:53.463 --> 1:24:55.507
-This is a cut.
-What a bore.

1:25:00.345 --> 1:25:02.264
- Luke?
- In here!

1:25:04.432 --> 1:25:06.434
This shelf is driving me crazy.
It wobbles.

1:25:06.518 --> 1:25:07.895
I'm just trying to shore it up.

1:25:07.978 --> 1:25:09.354
Right, good.

1:25:10.272 --> 1:25:11.273
Um...

1:25:12.482 --> 1:25:13.901
We need to talk.

1:25:13.984 --> 1:25:16.278
I'm kind of in the middle of this thing.

1:25:16.361 --> 1:25:17.988
I have to tell you something.

1:25:20.490 --> 1:25:21.742
Okay, tell me.

1:25:25.453 --> 1:25:26.997
I'm going away.

1:25:27.581 --> 1:25:28.749
You're going away?

1:25:29.708 --> 1:25:31.627
And I might be gone for a while.

1:25:32.544 --> 1:25:35.547
-What's a while?
-A few weeks.

1:25:36.632 --> 1:25:39.259
-A few weeks?
-Maybe longer.

1:25:39.342 --> 1:25:41.386
Lorelai, what is this?

1:25:42.429 --> 1:25:45.140
I'm gonna do <i>Wild.</i>

1:25:45.223 --> 1:25:46.850
-What?
<i>-Wild.</i>

1:25:47.768 --> 1:25:49.477
-I don't... You mean the movie?
-The book.

1:25:49.561 --> 1:25:50.688
What's the difference?

1:25:50.771 --> 1:25:53.774
The movie took liberties.
The book's pure. I'm gonna do the book.

1:25:53.857 --> 1:25:56.276
But what does that mean,
you're doing <i>Wild?</i>

1:25:56.359 --> 1:26:00.155
-I'm going to go to the place.
-The Pacific Crest Trail?

1:26:00.739 --> 1:26:02.032
And I'm gonna walk it.

1:26:02.115 --> 1:26:04.242
-Or hike it.
-Sure, let's go with that.

1:26:04.326 --> 1:26:06.912
-That trail's 2,000 miles long.
-I won't do it all.

1:26:06.995 --> 1:26:08.121
-And it's a trail.
-I know.

1:26:08.205 --> 1:26:10.123
-It's outdoors. It's in nature.
-I know.

1:26:10.207 --> 1:26:11.792
There's dirt, bugs, animals.

1:26:11.875 --> 1:26:13.711
-I know.
-Mosquitos, rivers.

1:26:13.794 --> 1:26:16.129
-I know.
-You have to carry your own backpack.

1:26:16.213 --> 1:26:17.923
-By yourself.
-I know.

1:26:18.006 --> 1:26:20.467
-You can't take Dewey and Brandon.
-Their mothers wouldn't let me.

1:26:20.550 --> 1:26:22.761
-You have to sleep on the ground.
-I know.

1:26:22.844 --> 1:26:24.054
-You cook your food.
-I know.

1:26:24.137 --> 1:26:25.806
-You boil your own water.
-I know.

1:26:25.889 --> 1:26:27.474
-You get water from a stream.
-I know.

1:26:27.557 --> 1:26:28.851
-That's in nature.
-I know.

1:26:31.478 --> 1:26:33.521
Well, I guess you know what's out there.

1:26:34.690 --> 1:26:35.941
And you're still gonna go?

1:26:36.859 --> 1:26:37.901
Yeah.

1:26:38.944 --> 1:26:39.987
Why?

1:26:43.573 --> 1:26:45.909
Because it's never...

1:26:47.535 --> 1:26:48.746
or now.
