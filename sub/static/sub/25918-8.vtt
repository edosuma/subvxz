00:08.425 --> 00:10.802
In this episode,
we're off to Washington, DC,

00:10.885 --> 00:13.680
to help the owner
of this historic firehouse.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.516
-This is... incredible.
-Special, isn't it?

00:16.599 --> 00:21.062
It looks like a frat house.
I don't know that I'm in a firehouse.

00:21.146 --> 00:24.774
By the time we're finished,
this will be a spectacular vacation rental

00:24.858 --> 00:26.526
where guests can sleep
in a piece of history.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.403
-I would stay here.
-Me too!

01:05.022 --> 01:07.025
-Ta-da!
-Wow.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.322
- Oh, my goodness.
- Lincoln always deserves a moment.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.160
That's why I'm glad we're getting
involved with these short-term rentals.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.288
So other people can have these
experiences, too. It's brilliant!

01:20.371 --> 01:22.999
It's a great place to visit.
Let's go visit Lincoln quick!

01:27.253 --> 01:29.380
♪ All around the world we go ♪

01:29.464 --> 01:30.465
Let's go!

01:30.548 --> 01:32.842
We're running! We're running!

01:34.052 --> 01:37.055
Could you kindly take us to the firehouse
on R?

01:37.138 --> 01:39.349
♪ All around the world we go ♪

01:43.478 --> 01:46.272
-It's really cool.
-Isn't it spectacular?

01:52.946 --> 01:56.241
Over 22 million people a year
travel to Washington, DC,

01:56.324 --> 01:58.243
to have experiences just like this,

01:58.326 --> 02:01.746
which makes this a great market
for short-term rentals.

02:03.039 --> 02:07.460
In DC, there are roughly 6,000 short-term
rentals like Airbnb or HomeAway.

02:07.544 --> 02:13.174
Last year, they made almost $259 million
in revenue for vacation rental owners.

02:13.258 --> 02:17.345
I am super excited about the property
we're going to be doing.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.264
There is nothing like it in the city.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.851
Of all the properties we considered,
I think we chose the right one.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.520
It's just what we're looking for,
it's a diamond in the rough.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.772
-Here are the pictures.
-I mean, it's pretty epic.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.608
The DC Firehouse.
It's in the Shaw District.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.735
It has three bedrooms, one bathroom.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.156
He's listed it at $250 a night.

02:36.239 --> 02:40.076
-It's a little bit tired.
-It is, but just architecturally,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.871
it's a legit firehouse
from the late 1800s.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.498
It's such an important
historical building.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.085
It was the first African-American
firehouse in DC,

02:49.169 --> 02:52.755
but I am just not seeing anything
about that on the website.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.091
He's not sharing that information
with the guests.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.843
And you know,
that's what travelers want.

02:56.926 --> 03:00.555
There's nothing that says,
"Hey! You're inside a firehouse!"

03:00.638 --> 03:03.600
The pictures are awful!

03:04.309 --> 03:08.313
don't take pictures
of your short-term rental

03:08.396 --> 03:10.565
- with your cellphone!
- Like a dating site.

03:10.648 --> 03:14.652
when you present yourself in a tired old
way, you're never going to get a date.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.779
Not that I know!

03:16.863 --> 03:19.782
We can transform this
into an incredible rental destination

03:19.866 --> 03:21.451
if we can fix the problems.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.635
-Wow.
-Oh!

03:39.510 --> 03:42.805
If I was renting this place for my
vacation, my first impressions

03:42.889 --> 03:44.974
would be, I think it's brilliant.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.020
The bloody pictures made it look like
an East Berlin police station!

03:49.103 --> 03:52.774
And walking up
to that firehouse, it's like, wow!

03:52.857 --> 03:57.695
Beautiful old architecture
and this huge feeling of excitement.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.197
I love the arches!

03:59.280 --> 04:01.282
What is going on
with the bloody flag!

04:01.366 --> 04:05.245
-What is it the flag of?
-It is the flag of discontent.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.165
Hey, guys, welcome. How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.375
How are you doing, mate?

04:10.458 --> 04:12.460
I've seen your picture,
I've seen your house.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.629
-Your house is incredible.
-It's special, isn't it?

04:14.712 --> 04:17.298
She's one of a kind.
That's why we're here.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.802
Hi, my name is Mike,
I'm a born and raised Washingtonian

04:20.885 --> 04:24.430
and I bought this property
four years ago for my own residence.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.266
I'm a financial planner downtown.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.559
I decided to turn this
property into my business.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.853
-Do you know much about the building?
-A little bit.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.939
Why don't you tell us your favorite
pieces of this?

04:33.022 --> 04:35.441
I love how old it is, first off.
This is from 1884.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.194
It was the first all-African-American
Fire Company in DC,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.613
-housed here from the '40s to the '70s.
-Amazing.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.408
-It was a hippie artist commune after.
-I didn't know that!

04:43.491 --> 04:45.868
Eventually it was auctioned off
to another private owner,

04:45.952 --> 04:48.538
for 20 years, then they sold it,
and I somehow got lucky.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.666
I reached out to Peter
and Genevieve because my goal for this

04:51.749 --> 04:53.459
is to cover my expenses with extra income,

04:53.543 --> 04:55.920
and try and create
a timepiece for the neighborhood

04:56.004 --> 04:58.464
that really shows the culture
and the history of this property.

04:58.923 --> 05:02.302
But as of right now, I'm having a really
hard time trying to make ends meet.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.553
I need help big time.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.263
-You live in the property.
-I live in Europe.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.889
- Actually, I have a rental unit.
- Okay.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.100
That's a three-bedroom apartment
for short-term rentals.

05:09.183 --> 05:12.395
I live in the front and honestly,
I have the best part of the space,

05:12.478 --> 05:14.188
which has those beautiful bay windows.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.442
You know the value in this, right?
I'm assuming you wanna build on that.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.943
-Absolutely.
-That's why we're here.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.862
Well, you've got the design,
and the business.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.781
-We're gonna make it good.
-Let's dig in. Come on.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.873
Through the hallway and upstairs.

05:31.956 --> 05:35.501
Here it is. Here's the rental unit
of my property.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.754
-Okay.
-So, you walk in from the outside,

05:37.837 --> 05:40.548
- this is the first thing you see...
- A room with no windows.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.716
Yes.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.429
- Frat house everything.
- Totally frat house.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.555
Right?

05:47.638 --> 05:52.477
Nothing about this room says
that you care at all about the guests.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.855
I don't know that I'm
in a firehouse.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.483
-Where's the firehouse?
-In this space? It's not.

05:58.566 --> 06:02.320
No. Okay, got it. Come on.
Let's go to the kitchen.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.739
-Here's the kitchen.
-Okay.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.283
Nice refrigerator, double sinks...

06:08.242 --> 06:11.329
island with some stools, nice oven...

06:12.080 --> 06:15.083
-Okay.
-Where's all the snacks and the...

06:15.958 --> 06:17.126
little treats for everyone?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.504
-Coffee?
-That would disappoint me.

06:19.587 --> 06:23.716
And if I'd flown in, three in the morning,
and my kids are screaming,

06:23.800 --> 06:28.054
and all I have is...
some Crisco and Barilla,

06:28.137 --> 06:31.057
that's not welcoming.
Your target audience is families.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.684
-Right.
-And you are just not hitting that crowd.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.771
I didn't realize this,
but when guests come to my house,

06:36.854 --> 06:39.774
they're expecting me to hold
their hand through the entire stay.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.527
There's nothing in this property
that welcomes me.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.821
Quite the opposite.
It makes me want to...

06:44.904 --> 06:46.989
- Work.
- Work! Right?

06:47.698 --> 06:49.951
-So let's talk about what we can do.
-Okay.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.244
So when your guests arrive,

06:51.327 --> 06:54.497
instead of walking straight
into an empty counter space,

06:54.580 --> 06:56.874
you can have snacks.
You can have drinks.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.377
-You can have a welcome basket.
-Fair enough.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.046
-All right. Let's go to the bedroom.
-Come on, Mike!

07:02.130 --> 07:04.924
- What the heck is this?!
- Now that says firehouse.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.968
This is kind of magnificent.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.303
Yeah, this is the original
fire pole from the property.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.680
- Solid brass!
- Yeah.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.932
-And that's not on the photographs.
-No, not at all.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.058
Okay.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.478
-All right. Nice finish.
-Rustic!

07:18.813 --> 07:22.483
Here's a bedroom, here.
Which is basically a den with a closet.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.361
- Okay.
- That's exactly what it is,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.822
- a bed in a room!
- It's a little basic!

07:28.614 --> 07:30.992
The bedroom space just feels
really suffocating.

07:31.075 --> 07:34.036
There's no chair. Oh, there's a stool!
That's very nice of you.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.039
How would you feel
if you walked in a hotel room like this?

07:37.123 --> 07:41.586
This is not just your firehouse that
you live in and you rent parts of it out.

07:41.669 --> 07:45.840
This is a business. You got to think
like the GM of a small hotel.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.218
I'm starting to realize that this is
something I need to focus on more

07:49.302 --> 07:51.637
as a business,
but when guests come to my house,

07:51.721 --> 07:54.140
they're expecting more of a hotel type
of experience,

07:54.223 --> 07:55.850
not just a place to crash for the night.

07:55.933 --> 08:00.188
So on the other side of this wall
is what?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.315
My space, where I live.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.192
So all the goodies...

08:04.275 --> 08:06.861
-I've saved for myself.
-..the huge arch windows--

08:06.944 --> 08:08.654
-Are selfishly in my apartment.
-Oh, wow.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.491
So you have the goodies
and then you give the scraps to rest?

08:11.574 --> 08:13.659
-I guess you could put it that way.
-We gotta see it.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.412
-Can you show us the space?
-I'll show you.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.998
These are the original stairs.

08:19.081 --> 08:22.001
Beautiful.
So the master bedroom is up here?

08:22.668 --> 08:24.587
Uh-huh. Here's the main space.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.381
Those big windows have been hiding.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.966
Whoa!

08:30.051 --> 08:34.972
- Wow!
- This is so good!

08:36.307 --> 08:37.517
Look at this space!

08:37.600 --> 08:40.186
Okay. You've been hiding this
for yourself!

08:40.269 --> 08:41.854
-Yeah.
-You're so greedy!

08:41.938 --> 08:44.065
- I'm sorry.
- Although I kinda get why.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.775
-Can we go downstairs?
-Yeah, sure.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.780
I just have a simple living room set up,
some basic furniture.

08:51.155 --> 08:55.576
All the light of this
entire building is in this one room.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.620
I see the narrative.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.331
It now looks like a firehouse.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.625
So here's the business plan.
You're a young guy.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.418
-Not married.
-No.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.545
-No kids.
-No.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.797
You want to yield the best out
of the property.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.423
-Yeah.
-You gotta suck it up,

09:09.507 --> 09:11.676
and you should move in
to the other apartment.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.386
And we should fix this place up

09:13.469 --> 09:16.430
-and rent this out for short-term rental.
-Right.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.225
Tell me another building in DC
that has this.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.851
Never seen anything like this
before in DC.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.145
- Yeah.
- This is gold.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.022
-Let me break this down.
-Yes.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.567
If we break down this wall,

09:27.650 --> 09:30.194
open it up to that red hallway
fire pole,

09:30.278 --> 09:33.281
we also open it up to two more bedrooms.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.741
Then we close up the wall at the back

09:35.825 --> 09:38.744
to turn the back bedroom
into your living space.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.707
We're going to take those two bedrooms
and that fire pole in the hallway.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.668
-And this could be the rental.
-Now that is...

09:45.751 --> 09:46.627
I would rent that.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.129
- Slam dunk.
- You would rent that?

09:48.212 --> 09:49.505
And I am a snob.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.591
So this in turn would become
a three-bedroom.

09:51.674 --> 09:55.052
The two bedrooms down here
and your master bedroom upstairs,

09:55.136 --> 09:57.847
in which you can charge considerably more,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.724
-offer considerably more.
-Correct.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.435
Right?
And give a full firehouse experience

10:02.518 --> 10:04.020
with the addition of this room.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.021
Where am I gonna live?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.106
In the back one-bedroom
with that kitchen.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.442
- You know, I really like this space.
- Right.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.236
What do you think,
how much more could he make

10:12.320 --> 10:13.571
by opening this up?

10:13.654 --> 10:16.490
You're making, on average
across a 12-month period,

10:16.574 --> 10:18.701
-about 250 a night there, right?
-Yes.

10:18.784 --> 10:23.080
Your occupancy's about 75%,
that works out to be 22 nights a month.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.707
- Right.
- Five or six thousand a month,

10:24.790 --> 10:26.542
- you're pulling in?
- Five, six grand a month.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.211
There is another property
that's close to here,

10:29.295 --> 10:30.755
within quarter of a mile,

10:30.838 --> 10:33.674
that's an awesome Victorian townhouse

10:33.758 --> 10:35.509
that has a complete narrative.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.889
They're getting 375
and they are nowhere near as big as this.

10:39.972 --> 10:43.643
I think if you let us go to town
on this place,

10:43.726 --> 10:47.813
we can double your rate
and get you up to 500 a night.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.775
That's an increase of $66,000 a year.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.777
We love it. We want to go for it.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.153
- Yeah.
- Are you in?

10:54.236 --> 10:57.323
That makes a lot of sense, I'm really glad
you guys are helping me with this.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.325
-Let's do this.
-You're in? We've got a deal!

10:59.408 --> 11:01.494
-I like this!
-Yeah!

11:16.842 --> 11:19.720
Our business plan
for the firehouse has begun.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.432
For Mike to succeed, we have to spotlight
what makes his rental unique:

11:23.516 --> 11:24.558
its rich history.

11:24.642 --> 11:28.354
To do that, Genevieve is going to redesign
the property from top to bottom

11:28.437 --> 11:30.231
to tell the firehouse story.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.483
Then we'll lock down the best price

11:32.566 --> 11:35.152
to relaunch his new vacation rental.

11:35.236 --> 11:39.031
Finally, we'll show Mike how to provide
amenities for his target market:

11:39.115 --> 11:40.282
families.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.368
-Throw it?
-Yeah. Go ahead. Rock and roll.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.372
The exciting part. We are about to start
the renovation.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.207
Construction is in full swing.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.627
We're getting rid of all Mike's old stuff,
and the new design

11:51.711 --> 11:54.588
will focus on highlighting
the vintage firehouse aesthetic.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.257
It's going to look amazing.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.009
As you know before, this was

11:59.760 --> 12:02.680
-a refrigerator and a pool table.
-Right.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.391
So we're bringing the kitchen
into this main space.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.519
So it's a kitchen, living room
open layout.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.313
We're going to make a kid-friendly
bedroom down here

12:11.397 --> 12:14.150
with some cool bunk beds. And then I want
to turn the second room

12:14.233 --> 12:17.445
into like a firehouse lounge
that helps tell the history.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.363
-I have to honor the space.
-Right. of course.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.992
So we are using old cabinetry
from around the house

12:23.075 --> 12:26.036
and recovering it in a black
rolled steel.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.039
-This is beautiful!
-Which is super homage-y

12:29.123 --> 12:31.333
to the art of firehouse, right?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.335
Steel, brass, metals...

12:33.419 --> 12:35.296
-Manly stuff!
-Man, right!

12:35.379 --> 12:37.798
And the thing I like about this material

12:37.882 --> 12:40.885
is it looks sexy as hell,
but it's also super-durable,

12:40.968 --> 12:42.928
because we're gonna have
a ton of guests in here.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.389
Easy to clean, going to last forever,

12:45.473 --> 12:48.642
all of these go with the architecture
of this style and age.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.980
Our goal is to tell the story
of this property and to do that,

12:53.063 --> 12:55.691
we're going to head out and learn more
about its rich history

12:55.775 --> 12:57.526
and about the neighborhood it's in.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.944
The Shaw District.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.909
It includes places like Howard University,

13:04.992 --> 13:06.911
legendary jazz clubs on U Street

13:06.994 --> 13:11.832
and the former home of Carter G. Woodson,
the father of black history.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.043
There's a real mix between
the modern and historic in this area.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.924
For a deeper understanding
of the firehouse,

13:20.007 --> 13:21.801
we're meeting up with Mike's friend Lisa,

13:21.884 --> 13:24.303
who's taking us through
the DC Firehouse Museum.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.096
Lisa's been helping me
on this project,

13:26.180 --> 13:28.098
consulting me on the history
of my firehouse.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.935
Her firm does a lot of work
with historic properties in DC.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.646
What projects have you worked on
in the DC area?

13:33.729 --> 13:37.900
Well, we worked on the King memorial,
and then the new African-American museum.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.819
-Oh, the Smithsonian project?
-No big deal!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.654
No big deal.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.281
But those projects,
the key in those projects,

13:44.365 --> 13:47.535
is people leave and they feel
like they had an experience,

13:47.618 --> 13:49.620
not just knowing information,

13:49.703 --> 13:53.082
which is what you're going to get here.
You'll walk away with an experience,

13:53.165 --> 13:56.293
and anyone who's coming to see
Mike's place after you guys leave

13:56.377 --> 13:59.171
-will walk away feeling that.
-Exactly the same thing. Yeah.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.299
-So you gotta go in here and check it out.
-Amazing! Let's take a look!

14:05.469 --> 14:07.263
Wow!

14:07.346 --> 14:09.932
I wanna nerd out in here with you, Lisa!

14:10.933 --> 14:11.976
This is amazing!

14:12.434 --> 14:15.855
Yeah, I'm so glad you guys
had a chance to come here.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.189
Hi!

14:17.273 --> 14:20.734
I want you to meet Jim Embry.
Mike owns the old firehouse.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.236
Lucky you!

14:22.319 --> 14:24.905
Can you fill me in a bit
on the history of the firehouse?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.616
Well, the house was built in 1884,

14:27.700 --> 14:30.077
they went in service in 1885.

14:30.578 --> 14:35.916
In 1919, the first all-African-American
company was organized,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.504
and this was Engine 4 down
in southwest DC.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.464
That's the original station they were at.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.509
- All African-American Fire Company.
- Why their own company?

14:45.593 --> 14:49.513
Well, they thought they would not be able
to advance to be an officer

14:49.597 --> 14:53.392
if they were competing with
white firefighters for officer positions.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.476
Makes sense.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.645
So if they had an all-African-American
company,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.397
they could promote within the company.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.399
These firefighters
were dealing firsthand

15:00.482 --> 15:03.110
with the civil rights issues
of their time.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.779
And are these actually taken
at Mike's firehouse?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.907
-This is inside the house.
-That's in my garage!

15:07.990 --> 15:09.783
-This is the line up.
-There's the pole!

15:09.867 --> 15:10.951
-Yeah!
-There's the fire pole right there.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.288
This is them actually getting a call,
about 1943.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.790
Gordon Parks went around to Engine 4

15:16.874 --> 15:19.209
and did a whole series of photographs.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.754
I can't believe these are Gordon Parks.
Wow.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.131
He's a famous African-American
photographer

15:24.214 --> 15:27.551
who captured history
of the Civil Rights Movement.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.678
These are the soul of the firehouse.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.139
It honors the people
that have worked there before.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.141
Your place has such a story

15:34.224 --> 15:37.686
that if we can incorporate some of these
original photographs,

15:37.770 --> 15:39.605
under your supervision,

15:39.688 --> 15:41.941
it's just going to bring home
the narrative,

15:42.024 --> 15:44.526
which is just absolutely
what we're looking for.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.862
And that's going to make it like a museum.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.823
Yeah, it's gonna enhance the experience.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.202
It really gives us direction,
what we need to make this place look like.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.995
We're about to embark on this redesign

15:55.079 --> 15:57.623
that's going to make everyone
who stays this house understand it

15:57.706 --> 15:58.791
just as much as we do now.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.961
Honestly, I really want my rental unit
to look like the inside of that museum.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.379
♪ Let's go ♪

16:04.296 --> 16:07.466
♪ Changes everything, changes everything♪

16:07.549 --> 16:10.469
♪ Power changes everything♪

16:11.095 --> 16:12.596
♪ Changes everything♪

16:12.680 --> 16:14.056
♪ Power, come on!♪

16:14.139 --> 16:17.142
♪ Changes everything ♪

16:17.226 --> 16:20.229
♪ Power changes everything♪

16:20.312 --> 16:22.064
♪ Changes everything♪

16:22.147 --> 16:24.316
Come in here. This is what's happening.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.695
All right, we're cutting this out,
3.5-foot-wide opening,

16:27.778 --> 16:30.948
thick transition space,
probably about a foot

16:31.031 --> 16:33.075
-in between door to door.
-Okay.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.245
Seal that up, bring the light in,
bring the view of the fire pole in.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.456
So this is your cue
to vacate the premises.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.626
Upon arrival, you will come home
to a new everything.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.627
Okay.

16:43.711 --> 16:47.798
I know that all of these changes
seem expensive, and they are.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.342
This is not a cheap renovation at all.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.929
I really liked the space as it was before.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.516
If it doesn't work out, I'll have
a really hard time reversing this

16:57.599 --> 16:59.184
and going back to what it was before,

16:59.268 --> 17:01.478
or trying to make ends meet
with what they bring.

17:14.157 --> 17:16.410
-So how you doing, Mike?
-Hanging in there.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.079
Investing in any business
can be nerve-racking.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.375
So I want to help Mike optimize
one of the most important aspects

17:23.459 --> 17:25.377
pricing.

17:25.461 --> 17:30.007
I want to introduce you to Joe.
Joe is like a numbers ninja.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.134
He's the owner of this company
called All The Rooms

17:32.217 --> 17:35.637
and his company gathers all the data
about hotels and short-term rentals

17:35.721 --> 17:37.014
around the planet.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.142
He knows everything about pricing.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.728
-We're gonna make sure we get that right.
-Perfect.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.611
So, Michael, talk to me. Tell me a little
bit about how much you're charging now,

17:50.694 --> 17:52.780
how much you're making,
your occupancy rates.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.198
I'm charging $250 a night.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.534
I'm getting roughly $5,000, $6,000
a month from this three-bedroom.

17:57.618 --> 18:02.915
If I can somehow get a unit of my space
to cover the entire cost my property,

18:02.998 --> 18:06.168
that would just make things
a lot less stressful on me financially.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.753
There's a lot of things
you need to think about

18:07.836 --> 18:09.963
when you're putting a property up
on a short-term market.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.300
When you think about your target market,
especially for all the types of folks

18:13.383 --> 18:15.219
that come here,
22 million visitors a year,

18:15.302 --> 18:19.640
those are mostly families, right? And
a family person looking online saying,

18:19.723 --> 18:23.685
"Hey, this sounds kind of cool,
but I don't really feel comfortable here."

18:23.769 --> 18:26.146
You're probably losing a lot of business
on just that alone.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.149
How does this all relate?
When we start looking at the numbers,

18:29.233 --> 18:33.821
I see a massive amount of potential
on just doing some of the basics.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.532
I think it'd be really interesting
to get Joe's opinion on

18:36.615 --> 18:38.075
you know, where should we price it?

18:38.158 --> 18:42.496
DC right now, in aggregate, makes
about $260 million a year in gross sales.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.540
That's just to the vacation rental market.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.084
Within a half mile radius
of your property,

18:47.167 --> 18:51.171
the vacation rental market generates
about $26 million a year in gross sales.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.881
- Wow.
- You have to look at the fact

18:52.965 --> 18:55.717
that you actually have a whole home.
When you go a little bit deeper,

18:55.801 --> 18:59.471
that's only about 403 entire homes
within the surrounding area

18:59.555 --> 19:02.015
being priced at about $336 a night.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.936
So based upon what Peter and team
have been telling me,

19:06.019 --> 19:08.522
I don't see any reason why the property
can't be priced

19:08.605 --> 19:11.066
anywhere between $450-700 a night.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.069
How much?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.530
-Okay, let's not get too excited.
-Okay. Wow.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.575
Based upon all those improvements.
You have to make it all happen,

19:19.658 --> 19:22.286
which I believe it will.
Don't forget, it's about the experience.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.080
And the experience is going to equate
to actual numbers.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.708
So I'm putting a lot of money
into this property.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.544
And if I can get the kind of income
that Joe is suggesting,

19:30.627 --> 19:33.088
this project will pay for itself
in a couple of years,

19:33.172 --> 19:34.840
and that just makes me really excited.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.383
He's the best, dude.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.427
He can add a lot of value
to the pricing, for sure.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.187
Part of our new business plan
for Mike is

19:48.270 --> 19:50.647
to make this more family friendly.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.901
So we're building loft-style bunk beds
out of the original brass pipes

19:53.984 --> 19:55.027
we found in Mike's garage.

19:55.110 --> 19:58.405
This is the existing brass that was
in the original firehouse.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.866
That's cool. I think this is
worth some money.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.243
Oh, heck yeah.
I mean, scrap alone, it's amazing.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.287
We're not gonna scrap it,
we're gonna reuse it,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.122
but they have a variety
of different parts.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.291
So we have elbows to work with,
we have flanges.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.877
-We're gonna build a ladder out of this.
-A ladder out of this.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.795
So I wanna put the ladder
on the left side.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.423
And in the living space,
we're giving it a fresh coat of paint

20:16.506 --> 20:18.967
so the firehouse details really pop.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.719
Wow!

20:20.802 --> 20:22.304
- What do you think?
- Yeah!

20:22.387 --> 20:23.805
This is incredible!

20:23.889 --> 20:27.059
You caught us with our pants off!
We're not even dressed yet.

20:27.142 --> 20:30.604
I'm not just saying this,
but I am fricking gobsmacked.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.690
- What's the biggest deal to you right now?
- Now that you painted it white,

20:33.774 --> 20:36.777
-it's lovely and fresh now.
-Doesn't this make a huge difference?

20:36.902 --> 20:39.154
It just opens up the entire room.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.287
Families are Mike's target market,

20:47.371 --> 20:50.082
but when it comes to family friendly
amenities, he fails.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.834
So today, we're going to change that.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.921
Man, this is a lot of stuff,
all this baby stuff?

20:56.004 --> 20:59.424
Well, mate, you got to know your crowd,
you got to know the guests.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.009
Your place is a family spot,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.929
but there is no amenities
for families whatsoever.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.306
-Right.
-Something like 90%

21:06.390 --> 21:08.558
of vacations that are booked
are booked by moms.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.310
So we got to cater to that crowd.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.646
When I first started renting my space out,

21:12.729 --> 21:15.023
the last thing I thought about
was amenities,

21:15.107 --> 21:18.610
and now Peter is telling me that
the first thing I should be thinking about

21:18.694 --> 21:20.696
is amenities, amenities, amenities.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.615
If you have photographs
of this on your marketing,

21:23.699 --> 21:28.537
you're going to appeal to a massive,
massive bandwidth of potential guests

21:28.620 --> 21:30.956
and if they're comparing you
against another property

21:31.039 --> 21:33.000
and you're going to make
their life easier, boom!

21:33.083 --> 21:35.669
Then they'll recommend all the other
mothers to stay at my place.

21:35.752 --> 21:36.962
Of course! And referrals?

21:37.045 --> 21:40.132
They're the lifeblood of what we do.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.300
-Yeah.
-I'll drive.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.474
The firehouse design is really
coming together.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.352
The industrial fireplace is being
installed in the front room,

21:52.436 --> 21:55.647
and in the media lounge,
we're putting up a Gordon Parks mural

21:55.731 --> 21:58.984
to help our guests learn about
the firefighters who once lived here.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.695
We're also building a concierge desk
to direct guests where to go

22:01.778 --> 22:02.988
and what to do.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.742
-The maps, the guidebooks...
-Where to get pizza.

22:06.825 --> 22:10.078
-Things like that.
-Yeah. The manual lives in this room.

22:10.162 --> 22:10.996
Yes.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.414
After the museum,

22:12.497 --> 22:15.834
we also decided to create a time line
of the firehouse's history

22:15.917 --> 22:17.961
and apply it to the tall window
in the living room.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.339
Hey! This looks beautiful!

22:20.422 --> 22:22.424
The time line was such an important piece

22:22.507 --> 22:27.137
to the whole firehouse aesthetic,
and I know that it would totally get lost

22:27.220 --> 22:29.681
on the brick, if we had put this
on the brick.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.267
So decaling it on the window, it's good.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.769
-You like?
-It's really good, yeah.

22:33.852 --> 22:34.853
I love!

22:36.730 --> 22:39.024
To succeed in the world
of short-term rental,

22:39.107 --> 22:41.860
you have to offer more than
just a comfortable place to sleep.

22:41.943 --> 22:45.781
You have to guide your guests
to great local experiences.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.033
So on our last night, we're asking Mike

22:48.116 --> 22:51.578
to show us a local experience
he can guide his guests to.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.207
I'm taking Gen and Peter
to Ben's Chili Bowl

22:55.290 --> 23:00.921
because it is probably the most
recognized landmark in my neighborhood.

23:01.004 --> 23:04.466
It's been a place where a lot
of very famous people have visited:

23:04.549 --> 23:08.345
everyone from Chuck Berry
to Barack and Michelle Obama

23:08.428 --> 23:11.390
have gone out of their way
to visit this specific location,

23:11.473 --> 23:13.183
and become a part of that history as well.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.811
We're having one, two, three, four
half smokes

23:15.936 --> 23:18.563
and a couple of chili cheese fries.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.233
- Oh, my God.
- Wow!

23:22.275 --> 23:25.070
- So good!
- Best dog I've eaten in my life.

23:25.153 --> 23:28.156
You eat it with your hands,
then you lick your hands clean.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.825
It's all about the dog.

23:30.867 --> 23:31.743
- Virginia?
- Yes?

23:31.827 --> 23:34.287
We want to bring guests into DC

23:34.371 --> 23:38.125
and specifically the Shaw neighborhood,
so they can get to learn the history,

23:38.208 --> 23:41.837
they can meet you and they can
experience DC and live like a local.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.757
Can you tell us about this place?
How long have you been here?

23:45.841 --> 23:49.010
We opened on August 22, 1958.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.763
That means I've been here already
59 years.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.933
Dr. King had a satellite office up there,
you know, in that block.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.436
Whenever he came to Washington,
he would visit that office.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.020
And of course,
he'd come to the Chili Bowl.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.522
-He came here?
-Yeah.

24:00.981 --> 24:04.693
Can you tell us what happened
in the Martin Luther King assassination,

24:04.776 --> 24:07.571
-the riots that followed?
-I remember that afternoon,

24:07.654 --> 24:10.073
people were just coming in the door.
"Dr. King's been shot!"

24:10.782 --> 24:16.121
It was just tears, tears everywhere.
Everybody that came in was just crying.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.915
It was really very, very emotional.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.212
Everyone wants to feel the same way that
I felt when I walk into Ben's Chili Bowl.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.964
Everyone wants that experience.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.426
Virginia, I'm a massive,
massive Obama fan.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.887
-Great.
-Can you show me where he sat

24:31.970 --> 24:33.346
-and ate his chili dog?
-Of course!

24:33.430 --> 24:36.099
-And may I sit there?
-Please, of course! Come right on.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.143
Together with Obama.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.187
Oh, this is brilliant!

24:40.270 --> 24:43.273
One, two, three.
Beautiful. Got you.

24:45.734 --> 24:49.154
♪ Aim high, dream big
We're gonna make it ♪

24:49.738 --> 24:53.241
♪ Aim high, dream big
We're gonna make it ♪

24:53.366 --> 24:56.411
♪ Top of the world, this is our empire♪

24:58.121 --> 25:00.457
This goes to bedroom.
We have to hang the mirror still.

25:01.166 --> 25:05.629
Today is the big day and we're putting
the finishing touches on the firehouse.

25:05.712 --> 25:09.382
When you are staging for a rental,
you want everyone to know where to go

25:09.466 --> 25:11.927
and what to do
immediately when they walk in.

25:12.010 --> 25:16.264
So on the coffee table, we'll have wine,
wine glasses, a book to read,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.099
and it all sets the tone right away.

25:18.183 --> 25:22.062
This is the big difference
between a short-term rental and a hotel.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.941
Hotels can be cold and sterile
and homes are warm and welcoming.

25:26.441 --> 25:29.236
And now it's time
for one of the most important parts

25:29.319 --> 25:32.447
the photo shoot.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.574
All right, here we go.

25:34.658 --> 25:37.494
You've got to have great pictures
to sell your property.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.956
One, two, hold it.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.375
That's why I've called in
my photographer from Los Angeles

25:43.458 --> 25:48.880
to take some shots that will really help
sell the firehouse design and its story.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.924
That looks amazing!

25:51.591 --> 25:52.592
It's great. I love it.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.011
- This the money shot?
- This is the money shot.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.764
Now it's starting to look
more like a luxury hotel.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.099
-What do you think?
-Done!

25:59.182 --> 26:00.183
Let's go!

26:08.650 --> 26:09.651
This is the best part.

26:09.734 --> 26:14.698
It's time to reveal the treasure to Mike.
Peter! Bring Mike in!

26:15.323 --> 26:16.992
-Are you ready, Mike?
-Absolutely!

26:18.368 --> 26:19.244
Here we go.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.746
Ta-da!

26:21.830 --> 26:23.164
Oh, my God!

26:25.041 --> 26:26.626
Wow! You cleaned this place up!

26:28.461 --> 26:31.339
- Welcome home!
- Thank you!

26:31.423 --> 26:33.675
Great shot of the flag, wow.
It's beautiful.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.095
- Look at this guy!
- For your guests.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.723
You can hire this,
for kids to take pictures.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.684
- This all falls into your business plan.
- Ready to see your house?

26:42.767 --> 26:43.685
Let's do it!

26:47.230 --> 26:49.566
The big moment, here we go.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.152
Oh, my God!

26:53.945 --> 26:55.530
Completely changed the space.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.493
Oh, my God, this is so cool.

27:01.494 --> 27:04.706
- What do you think?
- This is beautiful!

27:13.131 --> 27:15.091
You guys completely changed
this place.

27:15.717 --> 27:20.513
Kitchen is the most important space
in any home, whether sharing it or not.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.308
When they come in, the first thing
I want them to see

27:23.391 --> 27:25.143
is that you thought of them.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.395
The more amenities,
it shows the more you care.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.482
And before? It didn't show
that you cared at all.

27:30.565 --> 27:35.862
All of these little nuances are
what set you apart from the competition,

27:35.945 --> 27:37.447
which means you make more profit.

27:38.531 --> 27:42.494
Oh, my God, look at that fireplace!
It looks so damn cool.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.788
Everywhere you look now, Mike,

27:44.871 --> 27:47.207
- you can see it's a firehouse!
- It screams firehouse.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.042
What is on the window,
is this a time line?

27:49.125 --> 27:51.795
-That's your time line!
-That is really cool!

27:51.878 --> 27:55.465
The time line, going back to the original
development of this property

27:55.548 --> 27:56.716
of the building in 1884.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.135
-That is so hip.
-2017.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.970
-I love that.
-The firehouse is renovated

28:01.054 --> 28:02.889
and listed as a short-term rental.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.475
Guests can now sleep
in a piece of history.

28:05.558 --> 28:07.268
Now that it's no longer a bachelor pad,

28:07.352 --> 28:10.063
you can have guests come
from all around the world

28:10.146 --> 28:11.439
to come and stay in your place.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.526
Your business plan is now
blown wide open.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.905
I can now have real guests here,
like families here, parties here.

28:18.988 --> 28:23.243
I would pay $500-750 a night
for this space.

28:28.748 --> 28:33.378
- Master bedroom, realized!
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!

28:36.548 --> 28:37.590
This is beautiful.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.343
It looks like my room,
but you just upgraded the hell out of it.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.886
- It's your room better.
- Yeah.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.724
These little thoughtful details--
towels stacked, a little bit of floral,

28:45.807 --> 28:49.477
if I'm coming in after a long flight,
these are the things I need right away,

28:49.561 --> 28:51.479
and you have it already 'cause you knew!

28:52.647 --> 28:55.150
It's details like this
that let your guests know

28:55.233 --> 28:56.693
that you really care about them.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.238
Now that I look at this room,

29:00.321 --> 29:03.992
I think about my stays in some hotels
in big cities and think to myself,

29:04.075 --> 29:08.288
that room alone would cost me
$200, $300 a night.

29:08.997 --> 29:12.292
And this is just one of the two or three
rooms in this space right now.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.460
Take a look at the rest of it.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.424
Wow! Look at the brass in here.
This is so cool.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.635
-Do you remember your bedroom before?
-I'm trying to forget it.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.304
It looks great.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.640
-We got all the baby gear.
-It's all stashed behind there?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.809
-It's stashed behind.
-Terrific.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.314
-Okay, Mike, you know what this is?
-I know what this was!

29:34.397 --> 29:36.608
It was a windowless
old bedroom.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.943
And now it's the firehouse lounge.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.489
This is gonna help tell the story
of the firehouse and the neighborhood.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.157
Before, it looked like a frat house

29:44.240 --> 29:47.035
and now it's finally
a family friendly firehouse.

29:47.118 --> 29:47.994
You just opened this up.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.997
This room is the beating heart
of the house.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.540
Recognize that picture on the wall?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.167
Of course,
it's the garage from downstairs.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.544
So this is your social media moment.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.839
All of your guests can now stand here
and get this in the background.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.257
Does the firehouse have
social media accounts?

30:01.341 --> 30:04.969
-Doesn't have a social media existence.
-Well, that's marketing 101.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.515
You need to have accounts
on all the major platforms,

30:08.598 --> 30:11.017
and every time you post anything,

30:11.100 --> 30:14.354
and thanks to Gen,
you now have thousands of things to post--

30:14.437 --> 30:16.856
#DCFirehouse4.

30:16.940 --> 30:20.443
Your guests, get them to put that
on all their social media,

30:20.527 --> 30:22.904
and they will market the property for you.
It's genius.

30:22.987 --> 30:26.199
I immediately realized that they've
created a separation for this room.

30:26.282 --> 30:29.828
A room where kids can play,
a room where people can watch TV

30:29.911 --> 30:31.412
and not get in the way of a dinner.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.248
And remember what we talked about:

30:33.331 --> 30:36.125
you got to predict what your guests
are gonna need.

30:36.209 --> 30:40.672
We have the top five shops,
the best food in the neighborhood.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.423
We gotta write Ben's Chili Bowl on there.

30:43.049 --> 30:46.177
And then remind me what you were getting
for the three-bedroom.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.848
$200-250 a night, roughly $6,000 a month.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.850
Looking at all the nice things
you did here,

30:51.933 --> 30:54.102
I think I can get 450-500 a night,
is that too high?

30:54.185 --> 30:57.272
I'd like to have a base rate
of $500 a night,

30:57.355 --> 30:59.774
then if you're slam booked,
you watch your numbers

30:59.858 --> 31:02.277
and you can always push your price up
accordingly.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.945
My tenants are going to love to stay here,

31:04.028 --> 31:07.490
and I'm going to feel a real sense
of pride about my property going forward,

31:07.574 --> 31:08.616
not just looking back.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.120
It's been a pleasure, my friend.
A pleasure.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.372
Good luck to you in your business.

31:14.831 --> 31:18.710
You're a fantastic person.
You're going to be a fantastic host.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.921
And now we need to go live
and launch the new property listing.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.301
The historic firehouse is able
to sleep ten,

31:26.384 --> 31:29.429
yet has all the creature comforts
any traveler could imagine.

31:29.512 --> 31:32.348
The new design echoes the rich history
of the property

31:32.432 --> 31:35.476
and the culturally diverse
Shaw neighborhood.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.439
Firehouse 4 welcomes you to become part
of her story

31:39.522 --> 31:41.482
and sleep in a piece of history.
