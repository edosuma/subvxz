00:23.477 --> 00:27.560
This is Houston. We're about to lose radio contact.

00:29.477 --> 00:33.311
This is Houston. We're about to lose radio contact.

00:38.269 --> 00:42.311
This is Houston. We're about to lose radio contact.

00:56.978 --> 01:01.895
-Wake up! Wake up!
-What?!

01:01.978 --> 01:05.603
-I can't sleep. -For fuck's sake.
-We've lost communication.

01:05.686 --> 01:09.395
-If I can't communicate with people I love, 
what does that mean? -Peace and quiet.

01:09.478 --> 01:11.478
-Do I exist?
-Oh my God.

01:11.562 --> 01:14.103
-Do you believe in God?
-For fuck's sake, what time is it?!

01:14.187 --> 01:17.603
-Are we going to crash into the sun?
-Probably. -Like Icarus.

01:17.687 --> 01:22.270
No, Icarus' downfall was due to
hubris. Excessive pride.

01:22.354 --> 01:24.979
-I wonder what my downfall is?
-Being an dick?

01:25.062 --> 01:27.812
Are you making a video?

01:29.937 --> 01:31.521
No...

01:31.604 --> 01:35.062
I see the laptop
screen. Get to bed.

01:37.354 --> 01:40.146
You looked like death-warmed-up earlier.

01:41.854 --> 01:45.521
Marion, have you looked in the mirror lately?

01:45.604 --> 01:50.229
-Stay out of this, Mom. -There's a
hair on your chin I could swing on!

02:26.272 --> 02:29.272
What are you looking at?

02:32.981 --> 02:35.106
Fucking hell!

03:07.482 --> 03:09.148
Anna!

03:32.816 --> 03:34.274
Get out!

03:34.357 --> 03:37.274
-I'm late!
-I don't care!

03:37.357 --> 03:42.649
-Didn't you use to live in a commune?
-Yes, but we didn't shower together.

03:42.732 --> 03:48.608
-Is it too much to ask to get dressed before you
leave the house? -I haven't left the house.

03:48.691 --> 03:54.024
If you two don't get out of here in 
5 seconds I will pull back this curtain.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.066
Oh my god, what is that?!
-Mom!

03:57.150 --> 04:00.691
Five, four.

04:00.775 --> 04:03.608
There is post for you.
-Three.

04:03.691 --> 04:06.691
-I don't care.
-Two.

04:06.775 --> 04:10.025
Can we have a chat about your
birthday tonight? -One!

04:10.108 --> 04:13.233
Oh my God, mom!

06:02.236 --> 06:04.278
Sorry..

06:07.528 --> 06:12.320
-You look like you're lactating.
-You need to be having sex for that.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.695
Is work interfering with 
Maggie's sun tan regime?

06:19.778 --> 06:24.070
She called me at half-7 to tell
me about her fungal infection.

06:24.154 --> 06:29.029
-This is not the week for her to be off sick.
-What's with the moles?

06:29.112 --> 06:34.446
They want us to keep a record of 
how many new ones come up every day.

06:34.529 --> 06:38.487
Something about old people tripping over them.

06:38.571 --> 06:41.654
Excuse me ladies, I just found this outside.

06:41.737 --> 06:44.779
Sometimes I wish the suffragettes hadn't bothered.

06:49.821 --> 06:52.988
Hello. You're a bit late for work, are you?

06:54.821 --> 06:59.780
My boss is away this week. I've
got the office to myself.
- You lucky git.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.863
I've got something for you.

07:07.405 --> 07:09.363
Shit!

07:13.655 --> 07:16.780
It had arms and a face.

07:16.863 --> 07:22.739
If I sent a photo, you might
think that I just googled it.

07:22.822 --> 07:26.239
But now I'm standing here
holding an old man's dick.

07:26.322 --> 07:29.239
-How's the book going?
-Yeah, it's good.

07:29.322 --> 07:31.614
What's it about again?

07:31.697 --> 07:36.739
It's about a cat who goes away. They wonder
where the cat's gone ...

07:36.822 --> 07:39.281
-Are you the cat?
-No, I'm not the cat.

07:43.489 --> 07:47.656
-Have you been washing up?
-I've got a wet bra on.

07:49.198 --> 07:52.531
I thought you'd been 
dipping them in your tea.

08:44.116 --> 08:48.408
-Ladies and gentlemen. Who are we?

08:48.491 --> 08:53.033
Billy and Anna are twins who grew
up in the arse end of nowhere.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.949
Yorkshire, Yorkshire!

08:55.033 --> 08:59.241
They spend their days like any radicals
on the fringe of society would.

08:59.325 --> 09:03.241
Dressing up like TV detectives from the 1970s.

09:03.325 --> 09:06.158
-and imagining they were in the A-Team.

09:06.241 --> 09:09.658
... in 1972 a crack commando unit was
sent to prison ...

09:09.741 --> 09:13.325
It was a happy time. Where dreams
of the future were forged.

09:13.408 --> 09:15.492
As far back as I can remember,
I've always wanted to be ...

09:18.575 --> 09:20.700
As far back as I can remember,
I've always wanted to be ...

09:22.658 --> 09:24.242
You gotta be kidding?

09:24.325 --> 09:26.409
As far back as I can remember,
I've always wanted to ...

09:29.617 --> 09:34.159
After narrowly avoiding being beaten up
their nan explained a painful home truth:

09:34.242 --> 09:38.492
It's a thin line between a 
maverick artistic genius

09:38.576 --> 09:41.451
or just some arsehole that 
everyone finds annoying.

09:41.534 --> 09:46.451
Astonished by the insight of this advance,
the twins forged a creative vision to help others

09:46.534 --> 09:49.243
-and thus "How To Live!" ...

09:49.326 --> 09:51.618
Stick the kettle up.

10:08.410 --> 10:13.285
Do you know what happened
to the microwave?

10:13.368 --> 10:15.868
Whose is that?

10:21.368 --> 10:25.327
Anna, this is my new hairdresser. Luke.

10:25.410 --> 10:30.577
-She doesn't always look this bedraggled
-I think you look great.

10:30.660 --> 10:35.535
You're clearly blind, Luke. I still have
spots of gray hair as well.

10:36.327 --> 10:41.911
-Don't be like that, don't walk off. He'll give you
a nice haircut. -Brilliant, mum, but I'm busy.

10:41.994 --> 10:44.994
Sorry, Luke. Anna!

10:53.244 --> 10:56.078
-You're being rude.
-I've got work to do!

10:56.161 --> 11:00.370
-What are you busy working on? I hope
you're not making those bloody film videos.

11:01.953 --> 11:08.286
You look like a homeless teenager. You should have a dog
on a piece of string.
-Some men like women who aren't making an effort.

11:10.078 --> 11:14.078
You don't look like you haven't made an effort;
You look like you can't afford to.

11:14.162 --> 11:19.203
You want to have a go at me as well?
What do you think about my hair cut?

11:19.287 --> 11:24.412
It not as bad as the one that is immortalized
in your passport where your gender is in question.

11:24.495 --> 11:30.162
Anna. I'm trying to do something
constructive for your welfare.

11:30.245 --> 11:36.120
-Bon Jovi is still here. -Don't shut
the door. We're not finished!

11:36.204 --> 11:40.662
-Anna. Just come and have a cup of tea.
-I'm working.

11:47.662 --> 11:49.163
Mum!

11:53.121 --> 11:55.871
-Mum. Calm
down, Marion.

11:55.954 --> 11:58.871
Don't tell me to calm down.
It can't go on.

11:58.954 --> 12:02.246
18 months in a shed is too much.

12:02.330 --> 12:05.038
Let's not row now, please.

12:05.121 --> 12:09.038
-You said you'd be out by now.
-I didn't, you decided I would.

12:09.121 --> 12:14.163
-You need to get on with things. You're gonna be 30 next week.
-Getting on with what? Getting a boyfriend?

12:14.247 --> 12:19.080
Well yeah, if it stops you moping around,
making them bloody film videos.

12:19.163 --> 12:22.163
-Well fine. You talk to her.

12:22.247 --> 12:25.414
What your mom is trying to say ...

12:25.497 --> 12:30.247
-It's not normal living in my shed at your age.
-Well you live with your mum and you're well old.

12:30.330 --> 12:33.955
She just means it's time you
started doing things again.

12:34.039 --> 12:37.872
-You can move into the house.
-No. I'm not doing that.

12:37.956 --> 12:43.414
Let's start again. What your mom means,
you're not really living right now.

12:43.497 --> 12:46.956
When I was your age I wanted
to have an adventure.

12:47.039 --> 12:50.581
Oh sheesh! She doesn't need a
bloody adventure.

12:50.664 --> 12:55.289
Anna you need to move on. I think we need to find
you a nice flat nearby. - Good luck with that.

12:55.373 --> 13:00.998
I mean it. I want you out of my shed by 
your birthday. This ends now!

13:04.040 --> 13:08.540
Do you want me to look at your hair?

15:17.627 --> 15:20.168
Anna, are you up?

15:22.918 --> 15:25.168
Anna?

15:25.252 --> 15:30.210
I was thinking. Should we just do a
show for your birthday?

15:30.294 --> 15:33.627
Westlife plays around the Civic.

15:34.669 --> 15:39.127
We should book it now, if you want to.
Maybe go to a restaurant ...

15:47.127 --> 15:50.752
Anna. It's still your birthday you know!

16:00.169 --> 16:05.753
-Were you up all night watching "Grease" on the telly?
-No. Were you?

16:05.836 --> 16:10.211
-My mom had it on.
-Oh aye, my mom had it on.

16:10.295 --> 16:13.170
Have you seen "Grease"?
-Yes.

16:13.253 --> 16:17.545
At the end he comes on in a white
coat, dressed like her.

16:17.628 --> 16:21.920
And she turn up in black,
just like him.

16:22.003 --> 16:27.337
He just takes off his coat, like yeah,
we'll just dress like me then.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.504
It's not even a discussion. Like
maybe they could dress like her.

16:30.587 --> 16:35.004
I know it's the 50s, but that's everyday
sexism, gone mad.

16:36.087 --> 16:39.254
-There's 21.
-How do you know that?

16:39.337 --> 16:42.046
I like counting.

16:45.712 --> 16:51.837
If we were ancient Greeks, I'd be like
Apollo. Like all rational and a bit anal.

16:51.921 --> 16:56.754
But you would be exciting and arty,
like Dionysus.

16:58.213 --> 17:02.921
Dionysus is the good one. Most
people want to be Dionysus.

17:04.128 --> 17:06.296
Bye.

17:08.921 --> 17:13.255
Alice, you did classics, right?
Who was Dionysus?

17:13.338 --> 17:18.255
A sex-obsessed pisser. You shouldn't
personify the moles, you know.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.338
Hello, kids club!

17:36.089 --> 17:40.797
You have to take your hat off. You need
to take your hat off.

17:54.131 --> 18:00.548
Please, do not use use the oars as weapons.
I repeat, do not use the oars as weapons.

18:01.256 --> 18:04.381
-Little shit...
-The mic's still on!

18:46.257 --> 18:49.799
What the hell? Are you trying to kill me?

19:06.300 --> 19:09.800
Marion, you have my cup of tea?

19:11.008 --> 19:13.050
Marion?

19:13.133 --> 19:20.633
It's next door's daughter and her little boy.
Guess that means there's not long now.

20:57.428 --> 21:01.011
-Hi! When did you get
back? -Yesterday.

21:02.094 --> 21:07.595
I've got to wait 2 weeks for my flat, so I thought
I'd come home. Get my sister to do my washing.
Show off my tan.

21:07.678 --> 21:11.220
-How are you feeling? -Yeah, good.
A bit jetlagged.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.553
Mensies surging out of me, as usual.

21:14.636 --> 21:19.262
-Fucking hell, you're living in here?
-Yeah, I just needed some space.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.220
There is not a lot of space in here.

21:22.303 --> 21:25.345
You remember, you, me and Billy used to make dens in here?

21:25.428 --> 21:29.845
Your mother would turn off the electricity,
to get us to come in for our tea.

21:35.179 --> 21:40.512
It's so weird being back. I can't get used to it.
Being in the sun every day.

21:40.595 --> 21:46.346
I've been really good about wearing sun cream though,
so I don't think I've got any skin damage.

21:49.137 --> 21:54.387
Hi Patrick. How are you?
Yeah, you're right, I have lost weight.

21:56.513 --> 22:00.721
So, I've got something for you.

22:04.596 --> 22:07.513
You're gonna be 30.

22:09.596 --> 22:14.555
-What are we gonna do for it then? We
gotta do something! -Why?

22:14.638 --> 22:20.805
Why don't we have a happy un-birthday
night. It will be fun!

22:23.930 --> 22:29.347
-You're still mkaing your videos? -No. I
needed to renew the domain name.

22:31.764 --> 22:34.764
-Do you wanna watch
"Rocky"? -Yes!

22:39.889 --> 22:42.305
I've got it downloaded.

22:43.347 --> 22:46.556
-I've missed you.
-I've missed you.

23:47.141 --> 23:49.557
Two minutes!

24:00.266 --> 24:03.891
-Hi. Are you OK?
-Yeah!

24:03.974 --> 24:09.475
-Your mom came into the office. You're looking 
for a flat? -God, my mum can just fuck off!

24:09.558 --> 24:14.683
-I like your badges. What is the green
one for? -I don't know.

24:14.766 --> 24:18.475
I think we should get badges
for adult life skills.

24:18.558 --> 24:25.975
You know like changing a car tire, or sowing, 
or sending something back in a restaurant.

24:30.308 --> 24:35.309
-Is that Brendan Myers? Since when did he move back?
-He's come back to write his masterpiece.

24:35.392 --> 24:38.142
What the hell are you wearing?

24:40.309 --> 24:44.309
-You're looking for faeces?
-Yeah.

24:44.392 --> 24:48.851
You are very good at spotting them.
Maybe you could get a badge for looking for faeces.

24:48.934 --> 24:51.434
Show your lunch box, Linford!

24:52.684 --> 24:59.601
Hiya, Brendan. How are you doing you big sexy beast?
Your buttocks are like glistening orbs in the morning dew.

24:59.684 --> 25:02.768
Sorry to interrupt for objectifying you.

25:02.851 --> 25:09.435
You do realize Anna's sitting and peeing?
Do you not see the steam? Maybe give her a tissue.

25:09.518 --> 25:13.560
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:13.643 --> 25:19.768
There are nettles down there so be careful. You do not
want a nettle on your fanny.

25:23.227 --> 25:27.352
You're a bully. -Does he still love
the Spice Girls?

25:27.435 --> 25:31.518
He's a lot taller than I remember. Not that
that actually means anything.

25:31.602 --> 25:35.852
I learned this after a very disappointing encounter
with a basket player.

25:35.935 --> 25:39.852
It has nothing to do with height,
or feet or anything like that.

25:39.935 --> 25:46.061
There were these Korean guys, and they measured 
them and found it is all in the second and fourth digits.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.352
So the key is, look at a guy's hands.

25:48.436 --> 25:54.602
Listen to me, otherwise you're gonna end up with
some nice guy who's got a poor digital ratio

25:54.686 --> 25:57.477
-and your vagina is never going to forgive you.

25:57.561 --> 26:00.769
So you've already bumped into the prodigal one?

26:00.853 --> 26:06.728
Yeah, what are you doing here?
-Saving the day. I'm helping her out with the kids company.

26:06.811 --> 26:09.894
You're dressed accordingly.
-Yes.

26:09.978 --> 26:16.186
-That's just not appropriate footwear
-I'm Miss Scarlet. This is my contemporary interpretation.

26:16.270 --> 26:19.103
I'm getting into my past,
Stanislavski style.

26:19.186 --> 26:24.478
-Do you think Stanislavski wore porn shoes?
-They're your porn shoes.

26:24.562 --> 26:26.520
Fuck!

26:26.603 --> 26:30.978
Hang on! I need you to play
the victim. -What?

26:34.395 --> 26:37.354
-So you're with anyone?
-Only in the mirror.

26:37.437 --> 26:42.312
Maybe you should become a lesbian.
It would quite suit you.

26:42.395 --> 26:47.271
I think you should get more in touch
with yourself.

26:47.354 --> 26:51.187
-Try yoga, meditation
... -Stop! No!

26:51.271 --> 26:55.771
You promised that when you came back
you wouldn't be wanker.

26:55.854 --> 27:01.438
Well if you'd come with me like you were
supposed to, you'd be a wanker too.

27:01.521 --> 27:04.771
-That doesn't make any sense.
-This is taking ages.

27:04.854 --> 27:08.396
-Because you're such a fat fucking bitch.
-Come on.

27:17.271 --> 27:20.646
Look. Come on.

27:22.105 --> 27:27.022
I want you to survey the scene.

27:27.105 --> 27:32.355
Something is wrong.
Things don't add up.

27:32.438 --> 27:36.980
Look at the people. How are they
behaving? What are they hiding?

27:37.064 --> 27:40.189
How do they give themselves away?

27:40.272 --> 27:42.772
She's alive. Case solved.

27:42.855 --> 27:45.730
-It's only a game.
-A rubbish one.

27:45.814 --> 27:49.606
Right! Let's go and interview Miss Scarlet.

27:49.689 --> 27:54.314
Then we're gonna look at a capsule
of information about the victim.

27:54.397 --> 27:57.606
-You look like Clint Eastwood.
-My name is Clint.

27:57.689 --> 28:01.314
-Very funny.
-Why?

28:01.398 --> 28:05.898
-You serious?
-Yeah. My dad is a cowboy. He blows buildings
up with dynamite.

28:05.981 --> 28:10.981
-Like a re-enacter?
-Yeah, that's what I wanna do when I grow up.

28:16.856 --> 28:21.023
Do you want to see the fastest
gunslinger in the West?

28:23.148 --> 28:25.982
-Did you see it?
-You didn't do it.

28:26.065 --> 28:29.773
-No, it's a joke.
-It's not funny.

28:30.940 --> 28:34.357
-One. -Four. - Two. -Four.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.732
-Three.
-Four.

28:36.815 --> 28:40.232
-Four.
-Four.

28:40.315 --> 28:43.065
-Six. -Four. Four,
four, four.

28:43.149 --> 28:45.190
Fourteen.

29:04.899 --> 29:08.108
-Oh my God! Oh my
God! -What the fuck's up with you?

29:08.191 --> 29:12.691
-We're gonna hit the sun. -Fucking hell. You
need to read "On the beach".

29:12.775 --> 29:18.483
It's about people awaiting the arrival of deadly
radiation. And how they're dealing with their impending death.

29:18.566 --> 29:23.941
They just went on, had picnics and did gardening and stuff.
Basically you need a goal. Like Rocky.

29:24.025 --> 29:29.150
Rocky trains to win the fight, and in doing it,
he regains self respect. Makes peace with the
person he'll never become.

29:29.233 --> 29:34.358
-Adrian says it in "Rocky 3". -When
she finally grows a pair.

29:34.442 --> 29:37.609
When she wears that great corral lipstick. -When she's finally
given some lines.- When she wears that nice necklace.

29:37.692 --> 29:44.984
What are you doing, you nutter? You need to look after
this little dude, cause he's driving the other kids mental.

29:54.359 --> 29:58.276
-Can you stop that?
-I'm bored.

29:59.817 --> 30:01.776
Why don't you draw her a picture.

30:01.859 --> 30:06.943
No, I'm not drawing a picture. People will look at it
and see what my feelings are doing inside.

30:07.026 --> 30:11.026
Well why don't you draw her a flower.
Or a rainbow.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.568
Can I have one?

30:27.235 --> 30:29.943
You missed a bit.

30:33.693 --> 30:36.318
You missed another bit.

30:41.569 --> 30:43.735
And there.

30:47.110 --> 30:51.736
-Don't say anything. -What on earth have
you been doing. Come here.

30:52.986 --> 30:55.152
Mum! That is rank!

30:55.236 --> 30:58.152
I can not believe it!

30:59.527 --> 31:05.861
Doesn't she look fun? Fantastic.

31:05.944 --> 31:08.528
Mind your fingers.

31:11.736 --> 31:14.486
Your face is so slim now, I can't get over it.

31:14.570 --> 31:18.570
Thanks. Yeah, I got dysentery when
I was in India. It was great.

31:18.653 --> 31:23.945
-When do you go back to London and start work?
-Actually I'm gonna have a bit of a career change.

31:24.028 --> 31:30.987
I got into a real energized headspace. I'll be a
choreographer and be a yoga teacher.

31:31.070 --> 31:35.278
-I'm rebooting. -It is a good time to
make a fresh start.

31:38.320 --> 31:44.237
Anna's problem is that her childhood ambition was to
be rescued by David Hasselhoff of Baywatch.

31:44.320 --> 31:50.821
-I wanted to be David Hasselhoff. -If that isn't
the cause of an existential crisis, I don't know what is.

31:50.904 --> 31:53.779
-Anna need a way to motivate herself.
-I can hear you!

31:53.862 --> 31:58.279
Annas's got ways to motivate herself. She just thinks
of Patrick Swayze topless.

31:58.362 --> 32:00.987
Not in "Point Break". That makes me wanna vomit.

32:11.529 --> 32:14.321
Why can't you be more like Fiona?

32:14.405 --> 32:19.946
-What? Go away for 2 years and shack up with a fat South-African?
-No, I didn't mean that.

32:20.030 --> 32:24.196
-She's just focused, isn't she?
-Leave her alone.

32:24.280 --> 32:27.780
Anna's just having a little think about what she wants.

32:27.863 --> 32:33.905
-What I want is for you to leave me alone. -Well I'll leave you
alone, while you look around this.

32:35.072 --> 32:36.572
What?

32:39.364 --> 32:43.530
-I never thought you'd move back here permanently.
-Well, you have.

32:43.614 --> 32:46.905
Not permanently, only while I write my book.

32:46.989 --> 32:52.531
-I changed it again, now it's about this ballet dancer...
... Is that you?

32:57.572 --> 33:02.781
Have you had a look around? -Yes. And it made me want to
slit my forehead and bleed all over the floor.

33:02.864 --> 33:07.364
It's like a contraceptive made
of chipboard and pebbledash.

33:07.448 --> 33:10.656
If she moves in here, her
hymen will grow back.

33:10.739 --> 33:14.239
-What does it always have to be
about sex? -Cause everything is  about sex.

33:14.323 --> 33:19.323
I'm gonna put you on the internet, and find a Neanderthal
that'll blow out the cobwebs in ...

33:19.406 --> 33:23.031
I'm not moving out until I've
worked out what I'm doing. So back off.

33:23.115 --> 33:27.365
You said that five months
ago. Time's up.

33:31.323 --> 33:33.323
Bye.

33:34.448 --> 33:36.073
See you.

33:59.032 --> 34:02.491
How do you know what
you want in life?

34:02.574 --> 34:07.366
Listen to your heart. Your heart will
tell you what to do.

34:07.449 --> 34:13.033
I can't listen to my heart. It tells me things like: You like
"X Factor" more than you care to admit.

34:13.116 --> 34:15.824
And: Consider a perm.

34:15.908 --> 34:20.033
I know what I want.
-Oh yeah. What?

34:20.116 --> 34:24.116
-A girlfriend. -You're not gonna find
one down here.

34:24.199 --> 34:27.908
-Come down here and give me a hand. -I will
not come down until my demands are met.

34:27.992 --> 34:31.324
You'll wait a long time then.

36:14.244 --> 36:17.745
-What are you doing?
-Accelerating the cycle of life.

36:17.828 --> 36:24.495
You can't just move them nearby. They have a strong
homing instinct. They'll come back. I saw it on "Baywatch".

36:24.578 --> 36:26.578
"Spring Watch", Mother.

36:26.661 --> 36:30.703
-Stop following me.
-No, he's going with you.

36:35.703 --> 36:37.995
That's my cowboy horse.

36:42.620 --> 36:47.454
Twenty-five. Twenty-six. Twenty
seven. Twenty-eight.

36:48.662 --> 36:51.704
I think I'm gonna be like you
when I am growing older.

36:51.787 --> 36:55.287
That's nice. It was a nice compliment.

36:55.371 --> 36:58.662
I meant sad and angry all the time,
after my mom dies.

36:58.746 --> 37:00.496
I'm not sad and angry all the time.

37:00.579 --> 37:03.287
-No friends, then.
I have got friends!

37:03.371 --> 37:06.788
Okay. Living with your nan, then.

37:06.871 --> 37:11.829
If you take your walkie-talkie home,
we can talk at night.

37:11.913 --> 37:15.538
How many moles are
there? -29.

38:23.831 --> 38:26.331
-Hi.
-Hi.

38:26.415 --> 38:30.207
-How are you doing? -Good. -Nice
bike. -Thank you.

38:30.290 --> 38:34.998
-How are things going? -Good, yeah good. I'm
on my way to the supermarket.

38:35.082 --> 38:38.582
-7:30. So life is good.
-So precise.

38:38.665 --> 38:43.582
-I don't like it when there are children there.
-Naturally. Yeah.

38:43.665 --> 38:47.582
Anna's just gone to the bar to get us a drink.
Do you wanna join us for a pint?

38:47.665 --> 38:52.082
No. I did not know you
were with Anna.

38:52.165 --> 38:54.957
-Why are you being weird.
-I'm not being weird.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.291
-Oh my God, do you like her?
-No.

38:58.374 --> 39:01.999
-I thought you...? -You thought what?
Why does everyone think I'm gay?

39:02.082 --> 39:05.999
I have a soft voice and
I wore pink shorts once.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.624
Hey, Anna.

39:08.708 --> 39:12.208
-See you later. -Nice
to see you.

39:12.291 --> 39:15.083
We're going to a club on Saturday! Join us!

39:18.333 --> 39:24.958
-I just had the weirdest conversation with Brendan.
-Nothing new there. It's like the "Wickerman" in there.

39:25.041 --> 39:30.250
It can't be worse than being at home. Honestly I 
can really see why you stay around here.

39:30.333 --> 39:35.083
Such a cultured place. That's
what dreams are all about.

39:35.167 --> 39:41.750
I dream of making a perfect lasagne. -That's quite 
an achievable dream for like seven quid.

39:41.833 --> 39:45.292
I did a Thai cooking class.

39:45.375 --> 39:49.917
I can make a Thai curry from scratch. Pad
thai, egg fried rice.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.417
Egg fried rice is Chinese.
It was a real cheap cooking class.

39:58.709 --> 40:00.626
Anna.

40:01.459 --> 40:03.667
Are you there?

40:05.417 --> 40:08.418
Hello? Hello?

41:33.670 --> 41:37.170
-How long have we been doing this?
-567 days.

41:37.253 --> 41:43.295
We'll just do the same every day. And then we die.
Do you think that makes us ...

41:43.378 --> 41:46.545
-Like John McClane in the "Die Hard" films?
-Sisyphus.

41:46.629 --> 41:53.337
He was condemned to repeat the same task. Pushing a 
rock up a mountain only to see it roll down again. Forever.

41:53.420 --> 41:58.629
We have to imagine we're bigger than our fate. -Blowing
up this spaceship would mean that we are bigger than our fate.

41:58.712 --> 42:01.837
-I have no idea what you're on about.
-Albert Camus' myth of Sisyphus.

42:01.921 --> 42:07.046
Was he a goal keeper? You need to lighten up.
You need to stop listening to depressing hippie music.

42:07.129 --> 42:11.046
Start listening to Whitesnake.
Here I go again on my own

42:11.129 --> 42:13.754
There, yes, my friend.

42:15.379 --> 42:20.296
Clint's staying here tonight. His
mum's in hospital.

42:20.380 --> 42:23.213
Can we tidy up please?

42:23.296 --> 42:26.463
-Why can't he sleep in the house?
-You don't.

42:28.088 --> 42:30.088
Is this clean?

42:32.672 --> 42:38.922
Is that your brother?
Yeah, that is Billy.

42:39.005 --> 42:43.213
-Is he dead in the photo?
-No! He's sun bathing.

42:43.297 --> 42:45.839
He looks dead.

42:47.214 --> 42:50.422
Was it fun being a twin?

42:58.839 --> 43:01.714
She finds it hard to talk about Billy.

43:01.797 --> 43:07.006
The sad thing is that he is dead.
Not talking about him.

43:16.173 --> 43:18.923
-You left him alone in there?
-Grow up.

43:19.006 --> 43:21.923
-Where's his nan?
-At the hospital.

43:22.006 --> 43:26.798
Well where's his dad? He's doing some
controlled demolition somewhere.

43:26.881 --> 43:30.006
I made that for him.

43:54.632 --> 43:58.716
Guided meditation for real men who
aren't into hippie shit.

43:58.799 --> 44:02.049
Number 16: Sheds.

44:03.132 --> 44:07.591
Man! Stop what you're doing!

44:07.674 --> 44:11.299
This is your time.

44:13.299 --> 44:17.549
There's nothing you have to do now
apart from friggin rest.

44:17.633 --> 44:22.258
Close your eyes. Noone is going to hit you.

44:23.425 --> 44:27.175
Imagine you're in a shed.

44:27.258 --> 44:32.383
A shed with adequate shelving, and nothing touching
the ground where it can get damp.

44:35.925 --> 44:39.717
Or imagine you are building
a dam in a river -

44:39.800 --> 44:46.092
a brilliant dam, where all the rocks fit together perfectly
and no bastard water gets through.

44:47.342 --> 44:52.509
Tell me when I to start.
-Muscle lady, designed for building dams.

44:52.592 --> 44:55.550
I ran out of rocks.

44:55.634 --> 45:02.009
There's meant to be no water getting through there,
and that basically looks like most of the water is.

45:03.676 --> 45:06.176
I am a man of many talents.

45:06.259 --> 45:09.801
Take it!

45:09.884 --> 45:13.301
I want to do a stunt ...

45:13.384 --> 45:16.218
Is that you and Billy?

45:16.301 --> 45:20.218
Do not touch my tapes.
They are precious.

45:21.384 --> 45:24.468
Nan made you this.

45:41.093 --> 45:44.718
-Have you got a teddy?
-No.

45:44.802 --> 45:48.094
Have you got a doll or a lion?

45:52.010 --> 45:54.469
Pass us your pillow.

46:06.469 --> 46:10.928
-What was that video for?
-Just fun.

46:11.011 --> 46:15.511
Why did the picture stop at the end?
-It is not finished.

46:15.594 --> 46:22.553
-Are there any more? -Yeah. Loads.
We had a website.

46:23.678 --> 46:29.803
We made videos that were bad instruction
guides for coping with things in life.

46:39.220 --> 46:42.345
Is this Billy's?

46:42.428 --> 46:45.220
No, it's mine.

46:45.303 --> 46:50.595
-Why do you have your hair in a pot?
-It is from just after he died.

46:54.220 --> 46:57.304
Your body is made up of
millions of cells.

46:57.387 --> 47:03.221
I've read somewhere that all your
cells are replaced after a few years.

47:03.304 --> 47:08.762
So every day I am less and less the person
I was when I was with him.

47:08.846 --> 47:14.304
One day there will be nothing physically
left of me from when he was here.

47:14.388 --> 47:18.888
-So I cut of my hair ... -Can I
look at the website?

47:38.388 --> 47:41.097
Guided meditation for real men who aren't into hippie shit.

47:41.180 --> 47:44.555
Number 3: Cowboys!

47:44.638 --> 47:51.472
Imagine that you are on a horse, let's call it
Tony. You're with your mates, and they are all straight.

47:51.555 --> 47:57.889
But you're drinking beer in a way that makes
women want you. Gulp! Gulp!

48:09.389 --> 48:12.973
Where have my shoelaces gone?

48:54.349 --> 48:57.390
This is for you. It's God.

48:57.474 --> 49:01.224
Good morning. Wakey, wakey!

49:01.307 --> 49:04.974
Oh you're up? I've got to get you to the hospital.

49:05.057 --> 49:08.974
Anna, I want all this sorted. We're
gonna look at a flat later.

49:09.057 --> 49:14.516
-I want to tell her about the boat we made at school.
-Tell her about it later. She's not going anywhere.

49:14.599 --> 49:19.933
-I come around tonight. -Come on,
I'll get you breakfast.

49:46.975 --> 49:50.850
We're gonna hit the sun in three days.
Have you got a teddy bear?

49:50.934 --> 49:58.184
No. They'll give you no comfort now anyway.
All teddy bears are nihilists. The question
is existential or moral.

49:58.267 --> 50:00.725
Let's go.

50:03.934 --> 50:07.976
The majority have no concept of the self.
so could be considered the former.

50:08.059 --> 50:13.393
Yogi Bear was a moral nihilist, stealing all
those picnics. With no consideration of the conseqences.

50:15.768 --> 50:18.768
-Anna, I mean it!
That won't help.

50:18.851 --> 50:22.143
Stop being so bloody sanctimonious.

50:23.309 --> 50:30.185
-What are you doing? They don't go there.
-Are you moral authority on this?

50:30.268 --> 50:36.810
Every knows you put the mugs on the top shelf.
You line them up between the prongs, not over them.

50:36.893 --> 50:39.893
Don't you write me a job description.

50:39.977 --> 50:42.810
Anna, get yourself out here right now.

50:42.893 --> 50:47.352
What shall I do with this?
Up my ass?

50:47.435 --> 50:49.727
Fuck off.

50:52.102 --> 50:56.519
Anna, I think you should know, that despite claiming
maturity, your mother...

50:56.602 --> 51:00.810
-just mimed the words
"Fuck off" to me.

51:00.894 --> 51:04.519
You can't get angry with people for
not behaving the way you would, Marion.

51:04.602 --> 51:08.311
Only a sociopath would put
mugs on the lower shelf.

51:08.394 --> 51:11.227
I'm not talking about the dishwasher.

51:18.686 --> 51:21.728
Marion, don't lose them both.

51:31.145 --> 51:36.520
-You didn't have to do that. I'm not 9.
-Stop behaving like it then.

51:36.603 --> 51:40.187
Can you not text and drive.
My life is in your hands.

51:40.270 --> 51:44.062
You are assuming that I am not
trying to kill you, Marion.

51:46.020 --> 51:49.978
Council toilet block looks salubrious by comparison.

51:50.062 --> 51:54.770
-You got anything else we can look at? -Not
within your specifications, I'm afraid.

51:54.854 --> 51:58.854
-Perhaps you should consider lowering your expectations.
-Or I could just give up on life completely.

51:58.937 --> 52:05.687
I can't imagine her bringing someone back here. Are
there any woman in the world shagging less than us.

52:05.771 --> 52:09.062
-Do not use that word.
-Fucking?

52:09.146 --> 52:13.354
-I cannot believe you're my mother?
-Let's get a blood test.

52:13.437 --> 52:16.354
-Sorry. -It's all right.

52:17.396 --> 52:21.188
Have you thought about Brendan?
He is quite hunky.

52:21.271 --> 52:27.313
Define hunk, Marion. I don't think anyone's
been hunky since 1965.

52:27.396 --> 52:31.730
-Brendan is gay. -I don't think
that's necessarily a problem.

52:31.813 --> 52:35.855
It would be healthy for you to be
emotionally involved wth someone.

52:35.938 --> 52:39.897
Emotionally involved?
Are we in "Pride and Prejudice" now?

52:39.980 --> 52:43.230
It would be good to develop
a bond.

52:43.313 --> 52:49.855
-You did not give Luke a chance.
-Jesus, Marion, the hairdresser? Have you gone completely mad?

52:49.938 --> 52:54.980
I can't stand a man who wears Ugg boots.
-I thought they look quite cozy.

52:55.064 --> 52:58.355
Cozy? Anna does not need cozy.

52:58.439 --> 53:02.147
She needs a man with arms chiseled
out of granite.

53:02.230 --> 53:04.939
that can chuck her across the bedroom. It's
what all women want.

53:05.022 --> 53:09.356
A monosyllabic lumberjack with
an artistic streak.

53:16.106 --> 53:21.981
-Don't put a lot on. -I'm not!
I just defining your cheekbones.

53:22.064 --> 53:26.898
I've seen it on my tutorial. You can make
really fat faces look slim.

53:26.981 --> 53:29.856
I haven't got a fat face.

53:29.940 --> 53:34.315
Deceptive. My face is five
times bigger than this.

53:34.398 --> 53:37.731
What the hell is that?

53:38.856 --> 53:44.107
Clint did it. It is God as a cowboy sitting
on a horse, on a cloud.

53:44.190 --> 53:49.773
-The kid has got issues. I like that he does stuff and is not
worried about what people think.

53:49.857 --> 53:53.565
You mean he's a little shit. -He's not
scared of messing up.

53:53.649 --> 53:57.024
If he wasn't 7 I'd say you have a crush on him.

53:59.940 --> 54:04.941
-You're kiddin?! -I need
to rub it in more.

54:05.024 --> 54:10.774
-I look like Adam Ant. -It'll
look much better at the club.

54:14.899 --> 54:19.899
-I feel like getting hammered.
-Come on let's buy some booze.

54:19.983 --> 54:24.691
What? We embrace restraint
whilst getting wasted.

54:24.774 --> 54:31.775
My challenge: If you can get a bloke to say the word
"period", without meaning anything historical,

54:31.858 --> 54:34.233
-then you have to snog him.

54:34.316 --> 54:39.525
Shit. I do not have
my phone. Sorry.

54:39.608 --> 54:42.400
Two seconds.

55:43.693 --> 55:47.902
It's really cold. It gonna make
my nipples stand out.

55:47.985 --> 55:50.193
Let's have a look.

55:50.277 --> 55:53.110
-It didn't work.
-Come on.

55:54.735 --> 55:58.569
Oh my God, that's my mum's hairdresser,
Luke. Don't engage.

55:59.819 --> 56:02.485
Hi, Luke.

56:03.902 --> 56:08.736
-Hello. -I like your hair.
Very 80s.

56:08.819 --> 56:11.777
Bit of double-denim for the ladies?

56:11.861 --> 56:16.152
If I give you money, can you get us some booze?
We're having a teenage night out.

56:16.236 --> 56:20.528
Is it fancy-dress? You
look like Mumm-Ra.

56:20.611 --> 56:24.861
Can you get us some booze or not?
or? -You're serious?

56:24.944 --> 56:31.945
Get us some alcopops or cider. Something
that looks radioactive. Thanks.

56:32.028 --> 56:37.695
I would not want him cutting my hair.
You reckon he straightens his mullet?

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:43.410
-What are you doing? You can't leave like that.
I didn't know where you were.

01:00:43.493 --> 01:00:48.285
You could have told me. And that
cab just cost me 40 quid.

01:00:48.368 --> 01:00:50.577
-40? -I
know.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.743
I didn't think you cared as you just had
your tongue down someone's throat.

01:00:53.827 --> 01:00:56.952
-You're still wasted.
-Whose fault is that?

01:00:57.035 --> 01:01:02.869
Sorry for trying to give you a good night out.
I been trying to make you smile again.

01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:05.410
Well you fucked that up, haven't you?

01:01:05.494 --> 01:01:12.369
-Did you lock my shed? -What? Yeah
... I can't remember. Why?

01:01:12.452 --> 01:01:15.327
My videos and my camera have been stolen.
-Are you sure?

01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:20.411
-Of course I'm fucking sure! You can't have locked it.
-I don't think someone's gonna take your videos.

01:01:20.494 --> 01:01:26.244
That just sums you up that you're so
self-absorbed. It's always about you.

01:01:26.328 --> 01:01:32.286
Oh my God. You make out like you're
the only one that knew Billy.

01:01:32.369 --> 01:01:35.786
-Bullshit. -You're not the only one who
loved him, you know.

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:40.536
Since when did you love him? You think
some snog on a school trip counts?

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.495
I'm talking about your mum and your nan.
Fuck you, of course I loved him.

01:01:45.578 --> 01:01:47.870
Fuck you!

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:16.871
Anna! May I tell you about that
boat we made at school?

01:02:16.954 --> 01:02:21.037
-What are you wearing? -It
shrunk in the wash.

01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:23.913
What the fuck, that's my brother's!

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.538
-You should not swear.
-You should not steal things!

01:02:32.621 --> 01:02:38.080
Your nan gave me
that. Was your nan an astronaut?

01:02:38.163 --> 01:02:43.580
-Did your nan go up into space? -No.
Does your mom know you're up at the crack of dawn?

01:02:43.663 --> 01:02:46.747
She is in hospital.

01:02:48.413 --> 01:02:51.872
You should get back to bed.

01:03:50.373 --> 01:03:52.790
Are you hung over?

01:03:56.373 --> 01:03:58.707
What do you think?

01:04:00.374 --> 01:04:03.749
It could be really nice.

01:04:05.707 --> 01:04:09.749
Come on, sweet heart.
Is it about the jumper?

01:04:11.749 --> 01:04:16.249
-Anna, please don't ignore me.
-Are you OK, love?

01:04:16.332 --> 01:04:21.166
Someone's been in my shed.
My videos have been stolen.

01:04:21.249 --> 01:04:27.333
-You might find them if you tidied up. -Stop
it! What do you want me to do, live in an empty box?

01:04:27.416 --> 01:04:31.666
-This is a lovely empty box, Brendan, thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:04:54.917 --> 01:04:58.583
-You coming, love?
-I'm gonna go for a walk.

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:09.917
I'm thinking of quitting.
It's not really for me.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.751
You are not very good at it.

01:05:12.834 --> 01:05:16.417
-What are you looking at? It was
"love" written on the pavement

01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:20.459
I took a picture of it, but
now I can't find it.

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:26.251
Maybe you are looking in
the wrong place. -I'm not.

01:05:34.126 --> 01:05:38.085
How is your period?

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:45.043
Don't ask that? Why would I say that?

01:05:45.126 --> 01:05:48.710
I said it because Fiona told me to ask you.
She thought you'd be impressed.

01:05:48.793 --> 01:05:53.793
But it felt wrong, instinctively.
I hate Fiona.

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:57.835
Fiona is your worst mate!

01:06:06.794 --> 01:06:11.085
This is Fiona's voice mail.
Leave a message.

01:06:11.169 --> 01:06:14.336
-Don't you fucking dare!
-What's going on?

01:06:14.419 --> 01:06:18.919
If these are broken, I will fucking kill
you. These are really fucking expensive!

01:06:19.002 --> 01:06:22.711
-Everything I ever had, she just broke it.
-You psycho bitch!

01:06:22.794 --> 01:06:27.128
I'm taking the cost of that laminator
out of your wages.

01:06:27.211 --> 01:06:33.086
You always insisted on laminating everything.
She laminated my degrees.

01:06:33.169 --> 01:06:37.628
-Laminate this. -If you stay around
here, you turn into that.

01:06:37.711 --> 01:06:42.920
-You know if you shat yourself,
you'd blame it on someone else.

01:06:43.003 --> 01:06:46.878
You laminated pictures
of Robert Pattinson.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:51.587
It was not Robert Pattinson!
-Why did you need it laminated? That is vile!

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:54.212
What are you getting on it? Fluids?!

01:06:54.295 --> 01:06:59.337
-I laminated it for her. -What? I
do not like Robert Pattinson.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:04.295
It was not Robert fucking
Pattinson! -All right!

01:07:04.379 --> 01:07:09.379
Should have known you two were in this together. Get you
and your diseased vagina out of my house!

01:08:22.464 --> 01:08:25.756
-Are you OK? -They
have killed them.

01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:32.423
Humanely though, with these tablets that
turn into gas. They don't feel anything.

01:08:33.589 --> 01:08:39.090
They are not in those traps. The traps
are only if it doesn't work.

01:08:39.173 --> 01:08:44.298
-So they're just dead underneath this?
-They were undermining the foundations.

01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:48.423
So I'll go walking around
on dead moles every day at work now?

01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:54.673
-Are you OK? -No. Everyone
is angry with me.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:09:00.590
-Because you don't like the flats?
-No cause I turn 30 in 2 days, and I live in a shed.

01:09:00.673 --> 01:09:04.590
And I make videos with
my thumbs.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:11.215
-You're weird, aren't you?. I like it. -Noone
wants to be liked for being weird, Brendan.

01:09:11.299 --> 01:09:14.799
I can objectify you,
if you want.

01:09:14.881 --> 01:09:22.049
I like your pale skin, your messy
hair and your smooth forehead.

01:09:22.131 --> 01:09:27.508
-Are you doing an inventory? -Sometimes it helps
to apply logic to emotional situations.

01:09:27.591 --> 01:09:33.424
I once did a cost-benefit analysis
of a relationship, to see if it was worth pursuing.

01:09:33.508 --> 01:09:36.758
She dumped me before
I could finish it.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:41.050
-She? -For fuck's sake,
I'm not gay!

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:45.258
I like girls. Like you.
Weird girls.

01:09:45.341 --> 01:09:49.216
But you always used to throw pebbles
at me when we were walking home from school.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.258
Yes, because I wanted to fuck you.

01:09:55.467 --> 01:09:57.675
Do it now.

01:09:57.758 --> 01:10:00.508
Do it now.

01:10:00.592 --> 01:10:02.592
Here.

01:10:16.176 --> 01:10:18.634
No.

01:10:24.759 --> 01:10:28.343
Where are you going? Are you okay?

01:11:18.427 --> 01:11:20.052
Clint.

01:11:21.594 --> 01:11:26.469
You come for bed now. I've got a
nice story for you.

01:11:50.053 --> 01:11:52.095
What?

01:13:34.514 --> 01:13:38.139
Don't go crackers, Marion.
Keep a lid on it.

01:13:38.223 --> 01:13:41.598
What on earth is going on?

01:13:41.681 --> 01:13:45.015
Anna!

01:13:45.098 --> 01:13:48.765
Calm down, Marion.
I'm calm.

01:13:48.848 --> 01:13:51.848
-Anna.
-What's up?

01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:56.223
What do you mean? Nothing, everything
is fine. Perfectly normal.

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:59.515
I just fancied sleeping in a tent.

01:13:59.598 --> 01:14:03.265
Get out! Bloody, get out!

01:14:03.348 --> 01:14:06.557
-Let go, mum. -No, you let go!

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.140
Will you just stop it!

01:14:10.224 --> 01:14:13.765
-I have had enough. -Can I
tell you about that boat?

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:17.807
Morning. Somebody's special day tomorrow?

01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:20.724
Get out of the way.

01:14:20.807 --> 01:14:24.266
-Mum! -Marion!
Stop it.

01:14:24.349 --> 01:14:28.016
I've had enough of this.

01:14:28.099 --> 01:14:30.433
Get out!

01:14:35.349 --> 01:14:37.683
Oh my God.

01:14:37.766 --> 01:14:40.891
-Anna? -I can feel
them.

01:14:44.308 --> 01:14:48.433
-What are you doing? There's
spiders on me.

01:14:48.516 --> 01:14:52.266
-Go inside, Clint. -I need
to tell her about that boat.

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:55.142
-Not now, sweetheart. -It
is important.

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:58.683
Fine, fine. Show me the
fucking boat!

01:15:03.892 --> 01:15:06.434
You little thief!

01:15:06.517 --> 01:15:09.559
This stuff makes you look ridiculous!

01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:13.142
What's happened to your
hair, darling? -She did it!

01:15:13.225 --> 01:15:17.100
No, I didn't. -Yes,
it's in your box.

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:23.976
I knew you were sad and
angry all the time!

01:15:24.059 --> 01:15:28.809
Maybe I didn't want to tell you that what's
happening to your mum, will fuck up your life -

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:32.351
-and you will never be happy again!

01:16:16.435 --> 01:16:18.477
What's up with you?

01:16:19.644 --> 01:16:21.727
Nothing.

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:23.894
Okay.

01:16:25.686 --> 01:16:28.519
I want to be alone.

01:16:28.602 --> 01:16:31.269
You are alone.

01:16:33.353 --> 01:16:37.728
Can something exist elsewhere after
it's stopped existing here?

01:16:37.811 --> 01:16:41.853
-Like a parallel universe?
-Like a website.

01:16:41.936 --> 01:16:44.020
I don't know.

01:16:44.103 --> 01:16:50.061
-Are there parallel universes? -They
don't know what's out there.

01:16:50.145 --> 01:16:54.687
I know one thing that is not
out there. -What is it?

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:58.145
Me.

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.854
Hello. I was just calling on you.

01:17:09.312 --> 01:17:11.520
What are you reading?

01:17:12.812 --> 01:17:16.312
It's a pact me and Billy made.

01:17:16.395 --> 01:17:22.396
We were forming an alliance to last for decades,
then we were going to meet up in our 70, and kill each other.

01:17:22.479 --> 01:17:26.021
-That's sweet.
-Yeah...

01:17:26.104 --> 01:17:28.771
I should go home.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.771
I brought this for you.

01:17:33.979 --> 01:17:39.229
I was gonna get you flowers, but I was
worried they'd die, so...

01:17:39.313 --> 01:17:42.313
-Brendan.
-Yes.

01:17:44.313 --> 01:17:48.480
Am I still a twin if
my twin's dead?

01:17:55.647 --> 01:17:58.022
Technically...

01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:01.855
... I don't think so. No.

01:18:31.981 --> 01:18:34.023
Mum?

01:18:35.273 --> 01:18:37.439
Mum?

01:19:10.482 --> 01:19:13.315
You have one new message.

01:19:14.607 --> 01:19:16.732
First new message.

01:19:16.815 --> 01:19:23.191
Anna, Clint's been missing all
day. We need to find him.

01:19:23.274 --> 01:19:26.441
We're all out looking for him.

01:19:34.774 --> 01:19:36.858
Clint.

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:40.899
Clint?

01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:44.441
Clint.

01:19:45.525 --> 01:19:48.066
Can you hear me, mate?

01:19:57.442 --> 01:20:00.650
Clint. Can you hear me?

01:21:13.652 --> 01:21:15.694
Clint!

01:21:21.527 --> 01:21:23.777
Clint?

01:21:26.486 --> 01:21:28.194
Clint!

01:21:40.986 --> 01:21:43.236
Clint!

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:50.653
Clint!

01:22:03.403 --> 01:22:05.695
Clint!

01:22:11.487 --> 01:22:13.904
Clint!

01:22:27.071 --> 01:22:29.112
Clint!

01:22:36.863 --> 01:22:38.904
Clint!

01:23:22.739 --> 01:23:26.947
I've really fucked up. -Because
you've shrunk my jumper?

01:23:29.781 --> 01:23:32.281
-I thought he'd be here?
-He'll come.

01:23:32.364 --> 01:23:35.864
What if he doesn't?

01:23:35.948 --> 01:23:39.656
-What if something's happened, it'd
be all my fault. -Don't be daft!

01:23:39.739 --> 01:23:46.364
I said some really shit things to him. I
just want to say that I'm sorry, but I don't know how.

01:23:46.448 --> 01:23:49.656
-Yeah, you do.
-No, I don't.

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:52.448
Yeah, you do.

01:23:54.865 --> 01:23:57.406
No, i don't.

01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:07.240
Who are you talking to?

01:24:09.907 --> 01:24:13.449
-Noone! -What are you
looking at, then?

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.615
Nothing.

01:24:17.699 --> 01:24:20.365
Ask him.

01:24:20.449 --> 01:24:23.949
Go on. This is your chance.

01:24:25.866 --> 01:24:31.532
-I don't want to. -No, but
you will.

01:24:44.533 --> 01:24:47.700
I need you to blow up my shed.

01:24:49.783 --> 01:24:51.950
Allright then.

01:24:53.033 --> 01:24:56.450
-Can I tell you about
the boat now? -Yeah.

01:25:01.325 --> 01:25:04.783
There was this man who made a boat.

01:25:04.867 --> 01:25:10.367
He kept sailing it and sailing it. Every time he
sailed it, it got old, it keeps breaking.

01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:13.950
He keeps getting new bits,
every time it breaks.

01:25:14.034 --> 01:25:18.867
Then one day he realized, there is nothing left of
the old boat. There was only new bits.

01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:23.575
He thought in his head, if it was
the same boat.

01:25:23.659 --> 01:25:26.909
-So what's the answer?
-There isn't one.

01:25:26.992 --> 01:25:30.451
It's one of them questions
that you have to think about.

01:25:31.534 --> 01:25:34.742
-What do you think?
-I do not know.

01:25:38.076 --> 01:25:40.534
Is that your dam?

01:25:42.076 --> 01:25:45.159
-Yeah. -It
is rubbish.

01:25:46.409 --> 01:25:48.410
Cheers.

01:25:50.035 --> 01:25:52.035
I got you this.

01:25:52.118 --> 01:25:55.618
Can I have his bike instead?

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.743
Right, let's get you across.

01:27:45.913 --> 01:27:49.580
I know what I wanna
do for my birthday.

01:27:49.663 --> 01:27:52.746
I want Clint to blow up my shed.

01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:55.038
Sorry.

01:28:30.747 --> 01:28:33.414
You alright?

01:28:40.331 --> 01:28:44.706
Anna. There is a young man
here to see you.

01:28:46.831 --> 01:28:49.498
I'll leave you to it.

01:28:57.456 --> 01:29:00.165
You can come in.

01:29:02.498 --> 01:29:05.123
Nice shed.

01:29:06.748 --> 01:29:12.832
It looks like Stanley Kubrik boxes.
He used to keep everything from his films in boxes.

01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:16.582
Like meticulously. All sorts of shit.

01:29:16.665 --> 01:29:20.457
People said, it was a sign of
his genius, so ...

01:29:21.874 --> 01:29:26.541
Let's just hope it doesn't mean you fuck up your
next film by denying the audience what they want.

01:29:26.624 --> 01:29:31.332
What do they want? -To see Nicole
Kidman's chumba-wumbas.

01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:39.708
Did you actually just laugh at something I said?
And there was noone here to witness it.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:42.333
That is annoying!

01:29:43.458 --> 01:29:46.833
-I've got you a present. -It's not
a deformed carrot, is it?

01:29:46.916 --> 01:29:48.416
No, it's not a deformed carrot.

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:07.792
Thank you.

01:30:58.168 --> 01:31:00.418
Congratulations.
