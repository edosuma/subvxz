00:01.710 --> 00:05.131
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.344
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.428 --> 00:13.014
His name, Merlin.

00:19.437 --> 00:21.022
(CHANTING)

01:29.548 --> 01:32.093
I'm a herder
from the northern plains, Sire.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.971
Three nights back, we were camped
beneath the walls of ldirsholas.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.306
Not sure I would've chosen
such a place.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.558
Good pasture is scarce
at this time of year, Sire.

01:39.684 --> 01:43.604
-What is it you have to tell me?
-While we were there we...

01:43.688 --> 01:46.524
We saw smoke
rising from the citadel.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.361
-And did you see anything else?
-No.

01:51.696 --> 01:53.948
-UTHER: Did you go inside?
-No.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.743
Nobody has stepped over
that threshold for 300 years.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.038
You must know the legend, Sire.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.083
When the fires of
Idirsholas burn,

02:04.208 --> 02:06.877
the Knights of Medhir
will ride again.

02:08.878 --> 02:12.717
See to it this man is fed
and has a bed for the night.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.179
-Take a ride out there.
-Why?

02:17.263 --> 02:19.432
So we can put
people's minds at rest.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.726
Surely this is superstitious nonsense.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.228
Gather the guard
and do as I say.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.902
-Why is Uther so worried?
-'Cause the Knights of Medhir

02:31.986 --> 02:33.696
are a force to
be reckoned with.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.283
-Do you believe the story, as well?
-It's more than a story, Merlin.

02:37.408 --> 02:40.328
Some 300 years ago,
seven of Camelot's knights

02:40.411 --> 02:42.913
were seduced by
a sorcerer's call.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.916
One by one
they succumbed to her power.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.712
At her command, they became
a terrifying and brutal force

02:49.795 --> 02:51.172
that rode through the lands

02:51.255 --> 02:54.133
leaving death
and destruction in their wake.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.926
-What happened?
-It was only after

02:56.010 --> 02:58.512
the sorcerer
herself was killed,

02:58.596 --> 03:02.099
that the Knights of Medhir
finally grew still.

03:03.434 --> 03:08.773
Merlin, if what Joseph says is true,
then something has awoken them.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.444
And I fear for each
and every one of us.

03:57.822 --> 04:00.825
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.870
Just a little cold.

04:06.122 --> 04:09.208
-Do you need something warmer?
-No. Thank you.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.923
What is it, Merlin?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.676
Don't tell me you've been listening

04:18.759 --> 04:21.053
to Gaius' bedtime stories again?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.514
| just hope
that's all they are.

05:01.886 --> 05:04.180
-You look well.
-Thanks to you.

| wear it all the time.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.394
| can't remember
when I last had a bad dream.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.397
But you do not seem happy.
Why's that?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.736
| would be.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.280
-If I didn't have to pretend.
-Pretend?

05:21.405 --> 05:24.074
That I am Uther's loving ward

05:25.075 --> 05:27.286
when I hate him.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.919
Have you ever imagined
a new world, Morgana?

05:35.711 --> 05:37.922
One where Uther was no more?

05:40.591 --> 05:44.428
-Sometimes.
-And is that what you'd like?

05:44.553 --> 05:46.931
| once had the chance
to be his assassin.

05:47.056 --> 05:50.017
-And what stopped you?
- I don't know.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.228
| believed he cared for me.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.441
But not anymore.
He cares for no one.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.320
So you want Uther destroyed
and his reign to end?

06:03.113 --> 06:05.241
More than anything.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.329
But it doesn't
matter what I want.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.540
The future is
not of my making.

06:12.623 --> 06:17.002
You are wrong, Morgana.
You underestimate your importance.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.257
The decisions you make now,

06:21.340 --> 06:24.927
will change the shape
of everything that is to come.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.098
-What do you mean?
-Whose side are you on, Morgana?

06:29.932 --> 06:32.810
Are you with Uther,
or are you with me?

06:34.436 --> 06:37.481
Are you prepared to help me
bring about his downfall?

06:41.318 --> 06:43.487
| am.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.825
| can't tell you how much
it means to hear you say that.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.008
(CHANTING)

07:28.032 --> 07:30.200
Good morning, my Lady.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.371
Morgana? Morgana?

07:35.706 --> 07:38.042
-Yes?
-Did you sleep well? (YAWNS)

07:40.336 --> 07:42.463
Yes.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.549
Better than you
by the looks of it.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.927

You have to stay in bed, Sire.
You have a fever.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.524
(EXHALES)

08:03.025 --> 08:05.069
I'll prepare a tonic for you.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.532
-When did he first fall ill?
-It came on this morning.

08:10.991 --> 08:15.829
-It's not something to worry about?
-No. It'll soon pass.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.041
Be sure to let me know
if there's any change.

-What noise?

08:47.611 --> 08:52.199
-A sort of trembling sound.
-That's your knees knocking together.

Damn!

Oh!

a little something myself.

what it is I'm looking for.

09:38.537 --> 09:41.915
Seems part of Joseph's story
was true.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.835
Probably just travelers
passing through.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.923

Your first battle wound. Here.

11:29.898 --> 11:36.196
-No. No, don't... You'll ruin it.
-Don't worry. You can mend it.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.411
Did anyone else escape?

11:47.124 --> 11:50.168
We need to get back to Camelot.
Gather reinforcements.

-Are they dead?
-No. They're breathing.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.731

- I didn't know it was you.

Calm down, Morgana.
Just tell me what happened.

Arthur, she's distressed!

15:08.909 --> 15:10.869
If she was awake,
then she must have seen something.

-You saw people getting sick.

-What could I do?

Morgana, I don't understand!

Why is it that
you're the only person awake?

-You haven't told anyone that?
-No, and I won't tell Arthur...

15:52.285 --> 15:55.038
There must be something
keeping you safe

15:55.122 --> 15:57.290
and I think that must be it.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.377
-Right.
-ARTHUR: I've found him!

16:06.133 --> 16:08.385
-Father!
-See, he's all right.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.555
-He's not all right!
-He's just asleep.

All we have to
do is find a cure, a way to wake them.

Who could have done this?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.150
You're the only one
who's not been affected, Morgana.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.318
There must be a reason.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.490
- Don't know.
-That's all you keep saying.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.659
You must know something.

No. They just fell asleep!

It's obvious.
When she started feeling sick,

16:39.374 --> 16:41.168
Gaius gave her a potion.
Right?

16:41.251 --> 16:43.587
When was she sick?
She never said that.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.006
She was one of the last
to be affected.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.926
-Somehow the potion must've helped.
-What about everyone else?

16:54.264 --> 16:55.682
By then Gaius was too ill.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.852
He didn't have the chance
to treat anyone else.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.941
Go and see if you can
find this potion.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.693

And I will.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.565
(LAUGHING)

23:20.316 --> 23:24.571
-I will. I promise.
- Ino longer trust your promises.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.782
| swear on my mother's life.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.619
Careful what you say.

23:38.251 --> 23:42.088
You have to help me. Please?

23:42.755 --> 23:45.842
Her life matters more to you
than your own.

23:45.967 --> 23:49.929
This is an oath
| believe you will honor.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.681
| will.

23:51.764 --> 23:56.102
It is one thing to cast a spell
that puts everyone to sleep,

23:56.185 --> 24:00.356
the power to maintain it
is a very different matter.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.527
It will need more than just words
to break this enchantment.

24:04.986 --> 24:09.782
-What do you mean?
-You must eradicate the source, Merlin.

24:09.866 --> 24:13.202
-Great! What is that?
-Not "what," but who.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.371
Such spells need a vessel.

24:15.496 --> 24:18.541
A constant living presence
to give them strength.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.962
The source of this pestilence
is the witch,

24:23.046 --> 24:24.547
the Lady Morgana.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.803
-It can't be.
-I've warned you about her in the past,

24:30.887 --> 24:34.682
but you have failed to take heed.
She is dangerous.

24:37.310 --> 24:40.313
-(SIGHS) No.
-And now she has chosen

24:40.396 --> 24:42.857
to turn her back on her own.

24:48.363 --> 24:52.825
-How do I stop her?
-That is easy, young warlock.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.203
You must Kill her.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.583
-No!
-The spell is woven

25:00.708 --> 25:04.420
with magic of such power
that even you are not immune.

25:05.588 --> 25:08.675
You must act now,
before it's too late.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.218
If you do not,

25:10.301 --> 25:13.680
then Camelot will fall
and Arthur will die.

25:14.055 --> 25:16.349
And the future
you were destined to share,

25:16.432 --> 25:18.351
will die with you.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.236
(PANTING)

26:11.154 --> 26:14.991
-What took you so long?
- I didn't know Uther's size.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.177
| was worried about you.

26:35.970 --> 26:39.098
-They're here. They're in the castle.
-Where's Arthur?

26:39.182 --> 26:41.684
He's gone to find somewhere safe
to move to.

26:42.685 --> 26:45.104
Thank you
for not saying anything to him.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.023
That's all right.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.358
You're a good friend.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.194
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

26:55.615 --> 26:58.618
We have to move my father
before Morgause gets here.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.870
Morgause.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.290
Come on, let's go!

27:06.000 --> 27:09.212
-You're not surprised?
-No, I am.

27:12.882 --> 27:15.384
We should be safe
here for a while.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.226
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

27:28.689 --> 27:32.860
-Must be the potion Gaius gave her.
-Yeah, must be the potion.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.572
ARTHUR: We can't
keep this up much longer.

27:36.656 --> 27:37.907
| know.

27:41.035 --> 27:42.745
We're in a servant's quarters.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.914
If we leave him here
they'll just think he's a servant.

27:45.039 --> 27:49.168
Not if Morgause sees him.
We need to get him out of Camelot.

27:52.713 --> 27:56.300
When we arrived, there was a cart
in the main square. Remember?

27:57.051 --> 27:59.720
You are full of
good ideas today, Merlin.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.598
You go and look.

28:17.530 --> 28:18.906
(CHANTING)

28:23.953 --> 28:25.037
(GROWLS)

28:26.789 --> 28:29.876
They're closing in, we won't make it
to the cart, not carrying Uther!

28:29.959 --> 28:32.461
That's why we've made this.
We're going to pull him.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.894
Get down and keep quiet.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.502
Protect the King,
get him out of here!

29:29.518 --> 29:30.603
(YELPS)

29:32.104 --> 29:33.147
Merlin!

29:43.658 --> 29:45.534

30:30.705 --> 30:32.873
Merlin, follow me

30:44.093 --> 30:47.430
ARTHUR: Morgana. We need
the remedy that Gaius gave you.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.100
-Morgana?
-I don't have it.

30:51.225 --> 30:57.064
| know that, but you must remember
what it was, what was in it.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.944
Come on, Morgana, we can't
keep going much longer. Think!

31:02.028 --> 31:03.154
I'm sorry.

31:03.237 --> 31:04.697
It doesn't matter.
We can't get it now anyway.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.783
-We're trapped.
-There has to be something we can do!

31:09.452 --> 31:11.620
Why...

31:11.746 --> 31:15.041
-Why didn't that knight kill you?
-How do I know?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.377
Because I'm a woman.

31:19.462 --> 31:22.048
Yeah. Maybe.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.549
Unless we can rid ourselves
of this sickness,

31:23.632 --> 31:25.801
then I don't see
how we're going to hold out.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.304
We have to destroy
the source of the magic.

31:28.429 --> 31:30.639
Which is?

31:31.807 --> 31:34.060
- Don't know.
-Then our only chance

31:34.143 --> 31:36.479
is to get out of Camelot.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.900
Help me with my father.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.162
You cut the blanket up,
we'll tie it to my father

31:53.287 --> 31:55.664
and we'll lower him onto the cart.

31:56.499 --> 31:59.001
-Arthur?
-Morgana, please, just do as I say.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.756
I'll fetch the cart round
to the window.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.092
You're going out there?

32:08.761 --> 32:10.513
-I'll come with you.
-No!

32:10.596 --> 32:13.182
You stay,
you protect my father.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.767
You won't reach
the cart alone.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.520
-It's suicide.
-We have no choice.

32:17.645 --> 32:19.855
-How are you feeling?
-Not bad.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.857
-You sure?
-Yeah. You?

32:21.982 --> 32:24.026
Never better.

32:24.151 --> 32:27.279
-Get me a pillow, could you?
-Don't mess around.

32:27.363 --> 32:30.991
Arthur? You...
Arthur, you need to stay awake.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.373
-Merlin!
-That's better.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.708
If you ever do that again...

32:40.501 --> 32:42.878
Well, don't fall asleep, then!

-Don't ask me.
-(LAUGHS)

33:38.267 --> 33:42.396
Here. You tear this up.
I'll make some rope.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.630
Here, have some water.

34:10.174 --> 34:12.342

-Here.
-I'm fine.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.113
You poisoned her.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.371
You gave me no choice.

36:45.454 --> 36:47.915
Tell me what you used
and I can save her.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.334
First stop the attack.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.755
You're nothing but a simple servant,
you don't tell me what to do.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.840
If you want to know
what poison it is,

36:56.965 --> 36:58.801
you will undo the magic
that drives the Knights.

36:58.926 --> 37:02.262
-Tell me the poison or you'll die.
-Then she'll die with me.

37:14.316 --> 37:18.695

But you give me no choice.
