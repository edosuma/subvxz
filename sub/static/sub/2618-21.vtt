WEBVTT

00:20.301 --> 00:22.501
Dude checking us out.

00:23.310 --> 00:24.709
Where?

00:24.776 --> 00:25.876
Black T.

00:29.403 --> 00:31.003
Pass.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.137
Why?

00:32.204 --> 00:33.403
He's a hottie.

00:33.469 --> 00:35.037
What did I tell you?

00:35.103 --> 00:37.336
Yeah, yeah,
surf the watch.

00:37.403 --> 00:39.536
Right, and he's wearing
a cheap knock-off.

00:39.603 --> 00:42.837
The plan is to find guys
with more money than us.

00:45.204 --> 00:46.469
Yeah, what up?

00:46.536 --> 00:47.903
WOMAN:
Help me, please!

00:47.970 --> 00:50.270
What? I can't hear you.

00:50.336 --> 00:51.536
<i>( crying ):
He's gonna kill me.</i>

00:51.603 --> 00:53.304
You have to help find Mitch.

00:53.369 --> 00:54.636
Mitch?

00:54.703 --> 00:55.903
Please!

00:57.170 --> 00:58.103
Who is this?

00:58.170 --> 01:00.270
Is that you, Stace?

01:00.336 --> 01:01.369
I think you dropped something.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.369
You have to help.

01:02.436 --> 01:03.770
Very funny.

01:03.837 --> 01:06.204
I don't have time
to play games, okay? Bye-bye.

01:06.270 --> 01:08.204
No, don't hang up.

01:08.270 --> 01:09.970
I've been kidnapped.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.137
He's gonna kill me.

01:12.204 --> 01:13.870
You're my only hope.

01:13.937 --> 01:15.204
Please.

01:15.270 --> 01:18.170
Oh, my God. Okay, just... chill.

01:18.237 --> 01:20.369
I'm getting help.

01:20.436 --> 01:21.970
Help!

01:22.037 --> 01:23.536
Chelse?

01:27.469 --> 01:29.703
Somebody! Help!

01:29.770 --> 01:31.204
Help! Please!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ma'am,

01:31.270 --> 01:32.670
stop. You can't be in here.

01:32.736 --> 01:33.837
What's the problem?

01:33.903 --> 01:35.170
I got a call. A girl.

01:35.237 --> 01:36.536
Says he's going to kill her.

01:36.603 --> 01:37.937
You got to help her.

01:38.003 --> 01:39.204
Officer?

01:39.270 --> 01:40.403
Let me see
that, please.

01:40.469 --> 01:41.403
Help me, please.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.703
I'm freaking out.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.570
You've got to help her.

01:44.636 --> 01:46.403
Please, help me.

01:46.469 --> 01:48.336
Who is this, please?

01:48.403 --> 01:52.003
<i>( crying ):
Mitch. Mitch.</i>

01:52.070 --> 01:53.736
Oh, God help me.

01:53.803 --> 01:55.137
Ma'am, this is Horatio Caine.

01:55.204 --> 01:56.369
I'm a police officer.

01:56.436 --> 01:59.003
Where are you?

01:59.070 --> 02:02.937
<i>( crying ):
I don't know. I don't...</i>

02:03.003 --> 02:04.204
MAN:
Give me the phone.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.237
Ma'am...
MAN:
It's over.

02:05.304 --> 02:06.570
Who am I speaking with, please?

02:06.636 --> 02:08.070
I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

02:08.137 --> 02:09.103
<i>( woman screams, gunshot )</i>

02:09.169 --> 02:10.770
Ma'am. Ma'am!

02:10.836 --> 02:12.204
Lieutenant?

02:12.270 --> 02:14.336
Here's what I need you to do.
Call this in.

02:14.403 --> 02:15.603
We've got a female kidnap vic,

02:15.670 --> 02:17.469
location unknown.
Anything else to go on?

02:17.536 --> 02:19.736
All we've got
is that phone.
What's her status?

02:19.803 --> 02:21.736
She's either dead or dying.

03:14.136 --> 03:16.203
Got a rush.

03:16.269 --> 03:19.037
COOPER:
Is this the cell phone
Horatio had sent over?

03:19.104 --> 03:22.370
Clock's ticking, so
this is priority one.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.470
I'm getting a warrant to
subpoena the service provider

03:24.536 --> 03:26.104
for a log
of the incoming calls.

03:26.169 --> 03:27.269
It's gonna take too long.

03:27.336 --> 03:28.803
It'd be quicker
to find out

03:28.870 --> 03:30.136
who she intended to call.

03:30.203 --> 03:31.837
How do you
want to do it?

03:31.903 --> 03:33.136
Predictive pattern analysis.

03:33.203 --> 03:34.837
People have habitual
dialing patterns.

03:34.903 --> 03:36.336
Means they make
predictable mistakes.

03:36.403 --> 03:38.236
Because most people dial
with their thumb.

03:41.169 --> 03:42.670
Let's start with what we know.

03:42.737 --> 03:44.336
Beach girl's phone number.

03:44.403 --> 03:47.203
The number's gonna be close,
so if the victim intended

03:47.269 --> 03:50.536
to dial a two, she could
accidentally hit a five, three.

03:50.603 --> 03:52.737
So you're inputting
percentage probabilities

03:52.803 --> 03:53.970
on misdialed digits.

03:54.037 --> 03:55.603
Narrows the search,
gives us a list

03:55.670 --> 03:57.470
of possible phone numbers she
may have been trying to reach.

03:57.536 --> 03:59.837
You should also know
the caller asked for Mitch.

03:59.903 --> 04:01.136
Oh, nice. Okay.

04:01.203 --> 04:02.670
Gives me something else
to cross reference.

04:06.370 --> 04:09.004
Here it is, only two digits off
from the beach girl's number.

04:09.070 --> 04:11.336
Looks like it's
an office number.

04:11.403 --> 04:12.670
Mitchell Collett,
Abex Corporation.

04:12.737 --> 04:13.970
Mitch is short
for Mitchell.

04:14.037 --> 04:15.203
I'm gonna
call Horatio.

04:15.269 --> 04:17.202
All right.

04:19.803 --> 04:21.202
Mitchell Collett?

04:21.269 --> 04:22.637
Miami-Dade.

04:22.704 --> 04:23.936
CAINE:
Mr. Collett, we have
reason to believe

04:24.003 --> 04:25.270
that your wife has
been kidnapped.

04:25.337 --> 04:29.136
I know.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.704
You know?
Look, I shouldn't even

04:30.769 --> 04:31.903
be talking to you people.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.704
The guy on the phone
said no cops.

04:33.769 --> 04:35.103
CAINE:
So, you've
been contacted?

04:35.170 --> 04:36.637
Call came in this morning
on my private line.

04:36.704 --> 04:38.437
What did he say?

04:38.503 --> 04:40.303
He said he'd kill her.

04:40.370 --> 04:42.470
They always threaten. That's how
they get your attention.

04:42.537 --> 04:44.503
This may just be an exercise
in criminal behavior

04:44.570 --> 04:45.836
to you, but this is my wife.

04:45.903 --> 04:48.270
Mitch, uh,
everything
all right?

04:48.337 --> 04:49.604
Heard the police
were here.

04:49.670 --> 04:50.970
I'm Dane Daniels.

04:51.036 --> 04:52.470
I'm the CEO here.

04:52.537 --> 04:55.170
I'm afraid this has us all
a little rattled.

04:55.237 --> 04:57.736
I understand. Mr. Collett, it is
good that they contacted you.

04:57.803 --> 05:00.604
Now what did the voice
on the phone sound like?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.437
We're a financial institution.

05:04.503 --> 05:06.403
All our phone calls
are monitored.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.036
You want to hear
the tape?

05:08.103 --> 05:09.437
I would.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.903
MAN ( on tape ):
Got your wife, Mitch.

05:12.970 --> 05:14.303
MITCH:
Who the hell is this?

05:14.370 --> 05:16.070
You know who you're
talking to? Do you?

05:16.136 --> 05:18.237
Wouldn't play tough guy
if I were you, Mitch.

05:18.303 --> 05:19.437
Brenda could get hurt.

05:19.503 --> 05:21.203
Let me talk to my
wife right now!

05:21.270 --> 05:22.503
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Down boy.

05:22.570 --> 05:24.170
You want to see her again,
it's gonna cost.

05:24.237 --> 05:25.736
I'll pay everything I
have, but it's not a lot.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.403
Start getting the money
together, I'll call back.

05:27.470 --> 05:30.403
Oh, and, uh, no cops,
or she dies.

05:32.203 --> 05:33.970
Mr. Collett,
does your wife have enemies?

05:34.036 --> 05:35.370
No.

05:35.437 --> 05:36.237
She's a homemaker.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.570
How about you?

05:38.903 --> 05:40.637
Our company had massive layoffs
this year.

05:40.704 --> 05:42.769
We're under investigation.
Do the math.

05:42.836 --> 05:44.537
Everybody knows on Wall Street.

05:44.604 --> 05:46.769
Okay, what do you need
from me to get Brenda back?

05:46.836 --> 05:49.570
I need you to stay close
and wait for the next call.

05:49.637 --> 05:50.936
Can you do that?

05:51.003 --> 05:52.769
TRIPP:
You mind if
we search

05:52.836 --> 05:54.103
your residence?

05:54.170 --> 05:57.003
I'll get my keys.

06:07.604 --> 06:08.970
It doesn't take
a rocket scientist

06:09.036 --> 06:10.736
to determine
the point of entry.

06:17.470 --> 06:19.936
DELKO:
Watch your step.

06:23.769 --> 06:25.136
Nice crib.

06:25.203 --> 06:31.403
Yeah. Looks like executive
bonuses were up last year.

06:31.470 --> 06:34.003
WOLFE:
Yeah, signs of struggle.

07:04.237 --> 07:06.136
We've got a plastic frag.

07:07.604 --> 07:09.103
Looks like
it impacted here.

07:11.637 --> 07:12.803
What do you
think it is?

07:12.869 --> 07:13.970
Hatch work pattern.

07:14.036 --> 07:15.803
Looks like
the grip from a gun.

07:21.370 --> 07:23.003
Should be enough to run.
If we get

07:23.070 --> 07:25.237
a suspect, it'd be nice
to tie it back to someone.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.403
Is that the
broken gun grip?

07:42.470 --> 07:44.704
Yeah. I sent a swab
to DNA.

07:44.769 --> 07:46.270
You started without me.

07:47.303 --> 07:49.303
You're late.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.503
So, uh...

07:53.570 --> 07:56.237
that girl, Gloria,
you still seeing her?

07:56.303 --> 07:57.370
Not in a while.

07:57.437 --> 08:02.537
You and Natalia-- is, uh...

08:02.604 --> 08:04.237
is everything good there?

08:05.903 --> 08:07.670
What's up, Wolfe?

08:09.070 --> 08:11.270
I went to a party at her
house the other night.

08:11.337 --> 08:13.337
You weren't there.

08:13.403 --> 08:15.170
I was the last
one to leave.

08:15.237 --> 08:18.036
So, uh...

08:18.103 --> 08:19.537
I was wondering.

08:19.604 --> 08:20.903
Wondering what?

08:20.970 --> 08:21.936
Uh...

08:22.003 --> 08:25.203
You and Natalia.
You guys...

08:25.270 --> 08:27.103
still doing your thing?

08:27.170 --> 08:29.537
No.

08:29.604 --> 08:32.003
We're not. We backed off.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.203
Really.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.537
Yeah, really.

08:37.604 --> 08:42.537
Because we were talking
and, uh...

08:44.102 --> 08:46.503
You know, I got the feeling
that she was interested.

08:46.570 --> 08:48.203
Yeah? Interested in what?

08:51.637 --> 08:52.769
Me.

08:54.903 --> 08:56.503
She's interested in you?

08:56.570 --> 08:59.736
Yeah. It was just a vibe
she was throwing me.

08:59.803 --> 09:00.769
A vibe, huh?

09:00.836 --> 09:01.803
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:01.869 --> 09:03.103
And before I
did anything,

09:03.170 --> 09:04.604
before it went any further,

09:04.670 --> 09:06.836
I just want
to clear it with you.

09:08.136 --> 09:09.503
You want to clear it with me.

09:09.570 --> 09:10.836
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:10.903 --> 09:11.903
I wanted to, uh...

09:15.103 --> 09:17.470
I wanted to get the green light.

09:21.070 --> 09:23.503
You're good to go, man.

09:23.570 --> 09:24.836
Clear for landing.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.370
Thank you.

09:40.270 --> 09:41.303
Hey.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.470
Hi.

09:43.537 --> 09:44.503
What's up?

09:44.570 --> 09:45.869
Just grabbing
my unsolveds here.

09:45.936 --> 09:47.869
A little job security.

09:47.936 --> 09:50.836
Yeah, I'm dealing with a bit
of a jigsaw puzzle myself.

09:50.903 --> 09:52.670
Epithelials from
the broken

09:52.736 --> 09:54.203
gun grip at
the kidnap scene.

09:54.270 --> 09:55.203
No hits on CODIS.

09:55.270 --> 09:57.036
Mmm. Good luck with that.

09:59.936 --> 10:01.570
Heard you had a party.

10:01.637 --> 10:05.237
Well, I mean, it wasn't
really like a party party.

10:05.303 --> 10:07.237
I just had some people over.

10:07.303 --> 10:09.337
Yeah. Well, my
phone didn't ring.

10:09.403 --> 10:11.903
Because I thought
you were working.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.869
You would have known
if you called.

10:15.637 --> 10:17.869
You know, I thought
that we both decided

10:17.936 --> 10:19.736
that we were
moving too fast so I guess

10:19.803 --> 10:23.170
I was just putting up
some boundaries.

10:23.237 --> 10:24.769
Mission accomplished.

10:24.836 --> 10:26.670
DUQUESNE:
Sorry to interrupt you guys,
kidnap case.

10:26.736 --> 10:28.537
Brenda Collett's cell phone
is back on and Cooper's tracked

10:28.604 --> 10:29.836
the GPS.
Where?

10:29.903 --> 10:31.470
<i>DUQUESNE:
A house in Kendall,</i>

10:31.537 --> 10:33.036
<i>SWAT's contained it,
they're waiting for us.</i>

10:46.769 --> 10:48.337
Stay down. Stay down.
What've we got
on the kidnap case?

10:48.403 --> 10:49.936
Thermal sensor. Reads heat.

10:50.003 --> 10:52.670
Gives us a view
inside the house.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.203
We have a clear heat signature
of the occupants.

10:55.270 --> 10:57.003
Size, stance, says male.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.570
We think he's armed.

10:58.637 --> 10:59.869
Any sign of a woman?

10:59.936 --> 11:00.869
Second body, right here,

11:00.936 --> 11:02.936
prone, giving off heat.

11:03.003 --> 11:04.670
Gotta be alive
to do that.

11:04.736 --> 11:06.237
You think
it's our kidnap vic?

11:06.303 --> 11:07.803
Her cell phone
led us here, so.

11:07.869 --> 11:09.270
DELKO:
Wait a minute.

11:09.337 --> 11:11.103
He's pulling something
out of his waistband.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.136
You see that?

11:12.203 --> 11:13.203
He's moving down the hall.

11:13.270 --> 11:14.237
He's moving toward the door.

11:14.303 --> 11:15.570
He's coming out the front door!

11:15.637 --> 11:16.570
SWAT LEADER:
Confirmed! He's got a gun!

11:16.637 --> 11:18.170
Suspect is armed!

11:18.237 --> 11:19.736
Red Team, he's on the move!

11:31.803 --> 11:32.736
Move! Move! Move! Move!

11:32.803 --> 11:33.970
Go! Go! Move! Go! Go!

11:34.036 --> 11:35.470
SWAT LEADER:
Let's find the girl.

11:35.537 --> 11:37.237
We're looking
for Brenda Collett.

11:37.303 --> 11:38.903
Go, go, go, go.
Search the house.

11:41.670 --> 11:43.637
<i>( over radio ):
Rear containment.
We've made entry.</i>

11:43.704 --> 11:44.803
We've got a female.

11:44.869 --> 11:47.270
Possible kidnap victim,
Brenda Collett.

11:47.337 --> 11:48.503
DELKO:
Is she alive?

11:48.570 --> 11:49.670
Johnny?

11:49.736 --> 11:51.503
CAINE:
Officer. Officer.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.437
Is that
Brenda Collett?

11:53.503 --> 11:54.803
DUQUESNE:
No.

11:54.869 --> 11:56.936
She's the common law.
High as a kite.

11:57.003 --> 11:57.970
Did you find the phone?

11:58.036 --> 11:59.170
Still looking.

11:59.237 --> 12:01.136
And there's no sign
of Brenda Collett.

12:01.203 --> 12:02.604
Okay.

12:02.670 --> 12:04.003
DELKO:
Unless he
stashed her somewhere.

12:04.070 --> 12:07.103
Unfortunately, now he can't
tell us where.

12:07.170 --> 12:08.337
There is a problem, Eric.

12:08.403 --> 12:11.237
Check his dental
work, please.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.003
His jaw's wired shut.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.537
This injury's at least
a couple of weeks old.

12:21.604 --> 12:23.036
Dental wire's already yellow.

12:24.303 --> 12:25.803
Ma'am, hang on a second.
Where are you?

12:25.869 --> 12:26.803
BRENDA:
I-I don't know.

12:26.869 --> 12:27.803
Ma'am?

12:27.869 --> 12:28.836
MAN:
Give me the phone.

12:28.903 --> 12:29.869
It's over!

12:29.936 --> 12:31.403
Who am I speaking with, please?

12:31.470 --> 12:33.237
<i>I told you to keep
your mouth shut! ( gunshot )</i>

12:33.303 --> 12:35.836
DELKO:
He wouldn't be able to yell
with his mouth wired shut.

12:35.903 --> 12:37.170
Bottom line is...

12:37.237 --> 12:39.003
<i>this is not the man
on the phone.</i>

12:54.503 --> 12:56.370
DUQUESNE:
I bagged a cell phone inside.

12:56.437 --> 12:58.203
I found it
on the couch

12:58.270 --> 13:00.203
next to where you were lying.

13:00.270 --> 13:02.069
We know it's
not yours.

13:02.136 --> 13:04.136
Come on, Kelly,
your boyfriend's dead.

13:04.203 --> 13:07.370
Who are you protecting?
Where'd you get the phone?

13:07.437 --> 13:09.969
I was looking to score, okay?

13:10.036 --> 13:12.403
When I went to cop,
I heard a backfire,

13:12.470 --> 13:14.770
I went into the alley and...

13:14.837 --> 13:16.336
free phone.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.370
I know what you're thinking.

13:26.437 --> 13:27.503
I didn't steal the phone.

13:28.703 --> 13:30.570
Show us where you found it.

13:32.270 --> 13:36.969
So according to Olive Oyl,
she found the phone around here.

13:37.036 --> 13:39.270
Well, if she's lying,
we'll know soon enough.

13:42.470 --> 13:44.203
There's tire tracks.

13:44.270 --> 13:47.637
You can barely see them,
but they're recent.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.603
I've got a casing.

13:50.670 --> 13:52.270
It's a .45.

13:59.837 --> 14:02.870
Well, I guess our doper
was telling the truth.

14:02.936 --> 14:04.804
This is where
our vic called from.

14:04.870 --> 14:07.270
That's right. She connected
with the girl from the cafe.

14:07.336 --> 14:10.837
Who gets Horatio on the line,
suspect hears Brenda's voice...

14:10.904 --> 14:12.936
<i>( crying ):
Mitch. Mitch.</i>

14:13.003 --> 14:14.804
<i>BRENDA ( crying ):
Oh, God, help me.</i>

14:14.870 --> 14:16.904
I don't know.

14:16.969 --> 14:18.770
<i>I don't...
( gunshot )</i>

14:18.837 --> 14:21.503
Yeah, but if you're a kidnapper,
why shoot your meal ticket?

14:21.570 --> 14:23.003
Hopefully, he was just
trying to scare her.

14:23.069 --> 14:25.069
All right, I'll get this
cell phone to Cooper.

14:25.136 --> 14:27.270
I'm going to get this
under the scope.

14:59.303 --> 15:00.670
Horatio, it's Calleigh.

15:00.737 --> 15:03.203
The .45 casing from the alley
got an IBIS hit.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.036
Rick Miller.

15:05.103 --> 15:08.370
Look, I told you
I don't know Brenda Collett.

15:08.437 --> 15:09.503
That's not true,

15:09.570 --> 15:10.503
is it, Rick?

15:10.570 --> 15:11.969
Really?

15:12.036 --> 15:13.703
You also have a .45
that's registered to you.

15:13.770 --> 15:14.837
Isn't that right, Frank?

15:14.904 --> 15:16.870
Yeah, says here
you shot an alligator

15:16.936 --> 15:18.203
in the Everglades
six months ago.

15:18.270 --> 15:20.036
What is that, some sort
of macho target practice?

15:20.103 --> 15:21.804
Come on, man,
they never found a gun.

15:21.870 --> 15:23.303
Plus, I like the outdoors, man.

15:23.370 --> 15:24.703
Fish and Game recovered casings.

15:24.770 --> 15:25.703
You were there.

15:25.770 --> 15:27.036
Where's the gun now?

15:27.103 --> 15:28.737
It was stolen in a burglary.

15:28.804 --> 15:29.837
Did you report it?

15:29.904 --> 15:31.403
What's the
difference, man?

15:31.470 --> 15:33.904
Difference is it was used in
a kidnapping this morning, Rick.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.370
Why don't you take another look
at that girl, sweet cheeks.

15:50.403 --> 15:53.069
Me and Brenda
had a little thing.

15:54.136 --> 15:55.537
She wanted to break it off.

15:55.603 --> 15:57.270
Rick, it's over, okay?

15:57.336 --> 15:58.904
This was all a mistake.

15:58.969 --> 16:02.837
Nothing that feels this good
could be a mistake, baby.

16:02.904 --> 16:04.003
I love my husband, Rick.

16:04.069 --> 16:06.936
You're saying
being with him

16:07.003 --> 16:08.837
compares to
what we have?

16:08.904 --> 16:11.236
It's over.

16:13.936 --> 16:17.069
TRIPP:
She broke your heart?

16:17.136 --> 16:18.936
Where'd you meet her?

16:19.003 --> 16:20.537
Abex.

16:20.603 --> 16:22.737
I was working the loading
dock over Christmas.

16:22.804 --> 16:24.637
TRIPP:
Her husband's company?

16:24.703 --> 16:26.270
Her husband counted
beans, you know?

16:26.336 --> 16:28.870
It made no sense she stayed
with that pencil neck over me.

16:28.936 --> 16:30.170
I was desperate.

16:30.236 --> 16:31.703
Figured she'd change
her mind, you know?

16:31.770 --> 16:33.303
Turn to a real man
for protection.

16:33.370 --> 16:34.637
Tell me what happened.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.136
And I want to know right now.

16:38.170 --> 16:41.170
I met this guy in a club
the other night.

16:41.236 --> 16:43.670
Paid him 500 bucks
to scare her a little.

16:48.336 --> 16:49.303
TRIPP:
Scare her?

16:49.370 --> 16:51.236
We call that "felony stupid."

16:51.303 --> 16:53.136
Whatever.

16:53.203 --> 16:54.437
He didn't have a gun.

16:57.936 --> 17:00.670
I gave him mine, told him to
grab her, drive her around.

17:00.737 --> 17:03.036
Haven't seen
him since.

17:03.103 --> 17:04.670
She was supposed
to call me, you know?

17:04.737 --> 17:06.369
Yes, but she didn't
call you,

17:06.436 --> 17:07.603
she called her husband.

17:07.670 --> 17:09.002
So your plan backfired,
didn't it?

17:09.069 --> 17:10.436
Yeah, and a lot of good
he's done her.

17:10.502 --> 17:12.670
I want to know what his name is,
the guy at the club.

17:12.737 --> 17:16.036
Charlie.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.502
Grey Goose and Seven.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.336
Don't know a last.

17:19.403 --> 17:22.837
Hey, man...

17:22.904 --> 17:24.236
I just wanted her back.

17:24.303 --> 17:25.904
So do we, Rick.

17:36.336 --> 17:39.336
DUQUESNE:
Rick Miller said this
is where he met Charlie.

17:42.336 --> 17:43.936
WOLFE:
Excuse me.
Yeah?

17:44.003 --> 17:45.136
We're looking
for Charlie.

17:45.203 --> 17:46.837
Corner booth?
Grey Goose?

17:46.904 --> 17:49.904
DUQUESNE:
He would have been
with this guy, Rick Miller.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.936
Sound familiar?

17:54.036 --> 17:56.437
Nope. Good luck.

17:56.503 --> 17:58.069
Excuse me?

17:58.136 --> 18:01.370
Look, there's a lot
of foot traffic through here

18:01.437 --> 18:04.069
and everybody's name is Charlie.

18:04.136 --> 18:06.437
Okay, I catch your drift.

18:12.804 --> 18:14.069
I know Charlie.

18:14.136 --> 18:18.036
He came in here last night
with this guy, Rick.

18:18.103 --> 18:19.336
WOLFE:
What can you tell us
about Charlie?

18:19.403 --> 18:20.870
Crappy tipper.

18:20.936 --> 18:22.603
<i>You always remember the ones
that stiff you.</i>

18:30.804 --> 18:31.870
I'm sorry, babe.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.537
I'll have to
catch you later.

18:33.603 --> 18:35.036
I'll have a little more month
at the end of the money.

18:38.303 --> 18:39.936
He gave me a keychain.

18:40.003 --> 18:42.503
Cheap bastard.
I was going to throw it at him

18:42.570 --> 18:44.069
the next time
he came in.

18:44.136 --> 18:45.804
You wouldn't happen to still
have it on you, would you?

18:45.870 --> 18:47.603
Actually...

18:52.804 --> 18:56.303
Huh. Here.

18:56.370 --> 18:58.236
You can have it.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.370
"C.P.E."

19:01.437 --> 19:02.969
Could be initials.

19:03.036 --> 19:04.003
Hey, Cooper.

19:04.069 --> 19:06.036
Yeah, have Tripp
run it.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.670
I'll be right there.

19:07.737 --> 19:09.969
TRIPP:
Waitress said you gave her that.

19:10.036 --> 19:12.069
Club valet said
you live down the street.

19:12.136 --> 19:13.637
Those your initials, Charlie?

19:13.703 --> 19:15.303
Just for business.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.804
Charles Pelson Enterprises.

19:17.870 --> 19:19.936
CAINE:
Impressive. Rick Miller
gave you up, Charlie.

19:20.003 --> 19:22.170
TRIPP:
Said he paid you $500
to drive the girl around.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.403
I don't know
what you're
talking about.

19:24.470 --> 19:26.003
Brenda Collett,
you idiot!

19:26.069 --> 19:27.770
We already know
about the kidnapping.

19:27.837 --> 19:28.770
Where's Brenda?

19:28.837 --> 19:30.403
I don't know.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.003
All right, that's it.
You're under arrest.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.136
Stand up.

19:32.203 --> 19:33.437
Stand up!
All right, wait!

19:33.503 --> 19:35.270
Just wait!

19:35.336 --> 19:38.136
Look, I meet this guy Rick.

19:38.203 --> 19:39.870
Dude starts crying.
He wants me

19:39.936 --> 19:41.336
to help him get
his girlfriend back.

19:43.403 --> 19:45.203
Just show her this.

19:45.270 --> 19:47.470
Man, it'll scare
the hell out of her.

19:51.003 --> 19:52.437
Even wrote up
a phony note,

19:52.503 --> 19:53.637
make it look legit.

19:53.703 --> 19:55.403
I know that.
I want something new.

19:57.103 --> 19:58.437
Sobered up.

19:58.503 --> 20:00.270
Realized I couldn't nab her
on my own,

20:00.336 --> 20:01.936
so I got a partner.

20:02.003 --> 20:03.236
The smart thing would
have been to call the
whole thing off.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.870
Yeah, well,
I spent the money already.

20:05.936 --> 20:08.170
Me and the guy were supposed
to just drive her to the beach.

20:08.236 --> 20:10.936
Then Dillinger,
he changes the plan.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.136
Wants to do it for real.

20:12.203 --> 20:13.837
The husband's rich.

20:13.904 --> 20:15.403
We got his wife.

20:15.470 --> 20:17.370
Let's send the ransom
note and get the money.

20:17.437 --> 20:18.870
Are you crazy?

20:27.470 --> 20:28.637
Next thing I know,

20:28.703 --> 20:30.170
I'm standing
on the side of the road.

20:30.236 --> 20:35.069
The last time I saw
her, she was alive.

20:35.136 --> 20:37.003
I don't know
where she is.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.537
TRIPP:
Well, we got
news for you.

20:38.603 --> 20:40.503
You and your buddy
just bought a kidnapping charge.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.837
I want to know
your buddy's name, Charlie.
Give it up

20:42.904 --> 20:46.036
or you buy
the whole enchilada.

20:46.103 --> 20:47.403
I ain't saying
nothing.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.537
You better hope
she's still alive.

20:53.804 --> 20:56.670
Hey. Started running
the call history.

20:56.737 --> 20:58.570
Brenda Collett's phone.
Take a look.

20:58.637 --> 21:00.637
For every call Brenda placed
or answered,

21:00.703 --> 21:02.603
a call was simultaneously made.

21:02.670 --> 21:03.837
Found out the number's
being forwarded

21:03.904 --> 21:05.936
to a recording system.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.837
<i>BRENDA:
Hey, honey, it's me.
Running late, a little late.</i>

21:07.904 --> 21:08.969
<i>Call me back.
Hey, Brenda, it's Patty.</i>

21:09.036 --> 21:10.403
<i>Where are you? Call me back.</i>

21:10.470 --> 21:11.770
<i>Hey, honey, it's me,
I just told </i>

21:11.837 --> 21:13.270
<i>the Kellers we're gonna
have to cancel.</i>

21:13.336 --> 21:15.036
<i>Let me know when
you're going to be home.</i>

21:15.103 --> 21:16.637
<i>I'll be therein a little
while. Talk to you later.</i>

21:16.703 --> 21:19.603
But we already know the company
monitors they're calls.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.537
Yeah, the company phones.

21:21.603 --> 21:23.036
This is a cell phone.

21:23.103 --> 21:25.003
Can you trace
the recording service?

21:25.069 --> 21:27.437
The recording system's
not really going to help us.

21:27.503 --> 21:28.870
We need to find out
who's listening to it.

21:28.936 --> 21:30.437
Page me when you know.

21:38.270 --> 21:39.303
Marisol?

21:39.370 --> 21:43.103
Our appointment's
at 6:00.

21:43.170 --> 21:44.904
I needed to talk to you.

21:44.969 --> 21:47.437
Okay. What's going on?

21:47.503 --> 21:49.136
After tonight,

21:49.203 --> 21:51.103
I want to stop
my chemo.

21:51.170 --> 21:54.103
I know I'm going to get sick
again, and I'm scared.

21:54.170 --> 21:56.904
Marisol...
I just don't want
to take that chance.

21:56.969 --> 21:58.603
I understand, but...

21:58.670 --> 22:02.103
if we lose you, then
nothing can happen.

22:08.003 --> 22:11.003
Uh...

22:11.069 --> 22:15.236
Well, if this is your
decision, you, uh,

22:15.303 --> 22:17.303
you have my full support.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.336
Okay?

22:22.503 --> 22:23.770
You're still coming?

22:23.837 --> 22:26.837
Of course I'm
coming with you.

22:26.904 --> 22:28.537
Good.

22:28.603 --> 22:32.036
As long as you're with me,
I know I'm going to be fine.

22:32.103 --> 22:33.203
And you will be.

22:33.270 --> 22:36.103
So I'll see you at 6:00.

22:36.170 --> 22:37.804
Yeah, I'll see you
at 6:00.

22:37.870 --> 22:39.870
Okay.

22:55.936 --> 22:57.069
Lieutenant Caine--
where is he?

22:57.136 --> 22:58.136
Hold on.
What's going on?

22:58.203 --> 22:59.370
They just dropped this off.

22:59.437 --> 23:00.303
Who's they?
I don't know.

23:00.370 --> 23:01.570
They kidnapped my wife,

23:01.637 --> 23:03.036
they were supposed
to call me.

23:03.103 --> 23:04.470
I started to open it,
but I couldn't.

23:04.537 --> 23:05.936
Please, hurry, somebody's
kidnapped my wife.

23:06.003 --> 23:07.270
They were supposed
to call me.

23:07.336 --> 23:09.003
They never call...
Sir, you keep saying "they."

23:09.069 --> 23:10.537
Who's "they"?
I don't know
who they are.

23:10.603 --> 23:12.136
If I know who they are...
Just hang on.
Just hang on.

23:12.203 --> 23:13.336
All right?
Please, hurry.

23:13.403 --> 23:14.837
Make sure we do this right.

23:14.904 --> 23:17.470
Okay. I wanted to open it,
but I got scared. Please.

23:17.537 --> 23:20.069
All right, give me the box.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.370
Oh, my God.

23:25.437 --> 23:27.236
Oh... Oh, my God.

23:28.936 --> 23:30.703
Brenda-- that's her earring.

23:30.770 --> 23:33.370
There's a note inside, okay?

23:33.437 --> 23:34.703
What does it say?

23:37.503 --> 23:40.870
It says five million
by the end of the day...

23:40.936 --> 23:42.603
or Brenda's dead.

23:58.869 --> 24:01.503
Alexx, have you seen Eric?

24:01.570 --> 24:03.570
He hand-carried
the ransom note to QD.

24:03.637 --> 24:04.570
Okay.

24:04.637 --> 24:05.836
Horatio.
Yeah.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.370
I took a preliminary look.

24:07.437 --> 24:11.170
There's something interesting
about this ear.

24:11.437 --> 24:13.503
I don't see
any blood Alexx.

24:13.570 --> 24:17.003
Exactly
my point.

24:17.069 --> 24:19.003
<i>Sharp pointed weapon slicing
through</i>

24:19.069 --> 24:20.503
<i>capillaries full of blood</i>

24:20.570 --> 24:22.437
<i>would indicate
a victim was living.</i>

24:22.503 --> 24:24.370
There's no hemorrhagic tissue.

24:24.437 --> 24:25.870
So what are you saying?

24:25.936 --> 24:29.069
Maybe he killed the girl
and then cut her ear off.

24:29.136 --> 24:32.203
So the ear was removed
after she was dead.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.904
But there was
a ransom note
with the ear.

24:34.969 --> 24:37.904
Alexx, this is a game. He wants
us to think she's still alive.

24:37.969 --> 24:39.470
We need to verify
it's her ear.

24:39.537 --> 24:41.703
Should I ask the husband to
bring a DNA reference?

24:41.770 --> 24:43.470
You know what,
I'll do it.

24:43.537 --> 24:45.837
Brenda's hairbrush.
Thank you.
This will be very helpful.

24:45.904 --> 24:47.770
Hanna, the lab, please.

24:47.870 --> 24:48.969
Mr. Collett,

24:49.036 --> 24:51.570
I know this is
a difficult time.

24:52.037 --> 24:53.970
What are the odds
my wife is still alive?

24:54.037 --> 24:56.503
I need to believe
in something.

24:56.570 --> 24:57.903
Mr. Collett...

24:57.970 --> 24:59.636
$5 million--
I can't come up with that.

24:59.703 --> 25:01.137
My bosses are rich,
not me.

25:01.204 --> 25:03.037
I just make the deals,
crunch the numbers.

25:03.103 --> 25:05.070
Mr. Collett, someone is
monitoring calls

25:05.137 --> 25:06.137
from your wife's phone.

25:06.204 --> 25:07.469
The cell phone?

25:07.536 --> 25:09.003
Who would that be?

25:09.070 --> 25:10.237
I swear to you, Lieutenant,

25:10.304 --> 25:11.837
I don't know anything
about that.

25:11.903 --> 25:13.369
Please, find Brenda.

25:13.436 --> 25:15.003
CAINE:
I will.

25:24.703 --> 25:26.170
Knock, knock.

25:26.237 --> 25:28.204
Hi.

25:28.270 --> 25:29.403
Hey, got a minute?

25:29.469 --> 25:30.403
Uh, yeah.

25:30.469 --> 25:31.803
What's up?

25:31.870 --> 25:34.937
Um, what do you think about
Mexican wrestling?

25:35.003 --> 25:38.170
Is that a trick question?

25:39.837 --> 25:42.803
No, my friend got two tickets
at the Miami Olympic Arena.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.103
It's not really something
I'm into,

25:44.170 --> 25:45.670
but it's hilarious.

25:45.736 --> 25:46.803
They wear masks.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.336
And I thought you
and I could go,

25:48.403 --> 25:49.703
and we could laugh
at it together.

25:49.770 --> 25:50.770
So what do you say?

25:52.237 --> 25:53.703
Well, um...

25:53.770 --> 25:56.503
Wait a minute,
are you...

25:56.570 --> 25:58.103
Are you asking me out?

25:58.170 --> 26:02.270
Uh... yeah.
Yeah, I guess
in a way I am.

26:02.336 --> 26:04.603
Well, uh...

26:04.670 --> 26:06.870
Because, uh... I mean,

26:06.937 --> 26:10.237
you know that I'm
seeing someone, right?

26:10.304 --> 26:13.037
Oh.

26:13.103 --> 26:15.803
I'd heard that
it was over.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.770
From who?

26:17.837 --> 26:22.270
The, uh... the person
you're seeing.

26:22.336 --> 26:24.403
Really?

26:24.469 --> 26:26.137
Yeah, he gave me
the go-ahead in fact.

26:26.204 --> 26:28.837
The go... I mean, he
actually said "the
go-ahead"? He said that?

26:28.903 --> 26:32.237
I think what he said was that
you were cleared for landing.

26:32.304 --> 26:34.336
Wow.

26:36.137 --> 26:40.103
Wow. Uh, so I'm like
locker room talk then.

26:40.170 --> 26:41.336
No, no, no.
We were just...

26:41.403 --> 26:42.237
we were sitting there
and comparing notes...

26:42.304 --> 26:43.237
Comparing notes?

26:43.304 --> 26:44.536
Uh...

26:44.603 --> 26:47.037
You know what?
Forget I asked.
I'm sorry.

26:47.103 --> 26:50.436
No, no, no. You know what,
actually, if you want to go
to a boxing match,

26:50.503 --> 26:52.237
that's good,
I'm good.
Really?

26:52.304 --> 26:55.469
Mm-hmm.
Great. It's Mexican wrestling.

26:57.037 --> 26:59.403
And I thought we'd go
out to dinner first.

26:59.469 --> 27:00.703
I'm in.

27:00.770 --> 27:01.803
Great.

27:02.937 --> 27:04.003
Great.

27:04.070 --> 27:05.903
Yeah.

27:05.970 --> 27:08.603
Great.

27:12.870 --> 27:15.003
Calleigh...
I finally traced
the recording system

27:15.070 --> 27:16.304
on the cell phone.

27:16.369 --> 27:17.803
Did you get a location?

27:17.870 --> 27:18.870
The voice recordings
were digitized

27:18.937 --> 27:20.436
and then downloaded
to audio files

27:20.503 --> 27:21.770
that can be listened
to remotely.

27:21.837 --> 27:23.003
Audio files

27:23.070 --> 27:24.369
accessed by
an e-mail account.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.469
MITCH:
I mean, it's hard to be loyal.

27:26.536 --> 27:27.970
This Abex investigation,

27:28.037 --> 27:29.937
I'm stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

27:30.003 --> 27:32.336
BRENDA:
Mitch, maybe you better
talk to Dane about it.

27:35.536 --> 27:38.570
This corporation procures
the cell phones

27:38.636 --> 27:41.536
for employee use, Lieutenant,
and as CEO,

27:41.603 --> 27:44.369
I have the right
to monitor them
as I see fit.

27:44.436 --> 27:47.636
Yes, unfortunately,
the federal court system
doesn't agree with you.

27:47.703 --> 27:49.137
Well, it's a competitive world.

27:49.204 --> 27:51.237
And in finance,
you live and die

27:51.304 --> 27:52.469
by your decisions.

27:52.536 --> 27:54.237
And mine are designed
to protect me

27:54.304 --> 27:55.636
as well as my employees.

27:55.703 --> 27:58.304
Which explains why you spy
on their conversations.

27:58.369 --> 28:00.670
We need to identify those

28:00.736 --> 28:03.670
who are disclosing
company secrets.

28:03.736 --> 28:06.903
As in Mitch Collett's
conversations, right?

28:06.970 --> 28:08.870
Mr. Daniels,

28:08.937 --> 28:10.570
as the company accountant,
Mr. Collett

28:10.636 --> 28:12.204
knows where the bodies are
buried...

28:14.803 --> 28:17.403
You think that I kidnapped
Mitch's wife

28:17.469 --> 28:19.436
to keep him quiet?

28:24.304 --> 28:28.369
Yes, well, have fun
proving that.

28:28.436 --> 28:30.436
I'll contact
my lawyer.

28:30.503 --> 28:33.070
I think that's
a good idea.

28:39.369 --> 28:42.636
DNA results on
Brenda Collett's ear.

28:42.703 --> 28:44.403
There's a curve ball.
It's not hers.

28:44.469 --> 28:46.037
What?

28:46.103 --> 28:47.137
DNA doesn't lie.

28:47.204 --> 28:48.970
That doesn't make any sense.

28:49.037 --> 28:50.636
Is there any ID
on the donor?

28:50.703 --> 28:53.270
Female unknown.

28:53.336 --> 28:55.237
Whoever she is,
not in the database.

28:55.304 --> 28:57.103
It's a goose egg.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.137
The husband ID'd the
earring as Brenda's.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.603
Isn't he the one
who brought it in?

29:00.670 --> 29:03.137
Yeah, he is.

29:03.204 --> 29:05.636
Starting to look a little
convenient, huh?

29:05.703 --> 29:07.270
I'm going to check
the ransom note.

29:13.770 --> 29:15.970
Hi.

29:16.037 --> 29:17.436
Ransom note tell you anything?

29:17.503 --> 29:20.403
Latent prints were negative.
So was DNA.

29:20.469 --> 29:21.503
What about
the instrument?

29:21.570 --> 29:23.070
Author used a pen.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.670
Standard ballpoint
from any office
supply store.

29:25.736 --> 29:27.870
But take a look
at this.

29:28.603 --> 29:30.436
A watermark.

29:30.503 --> 29:31.937
That's a
true watermark.

29:32.003 --> 29:35.003
Made during the paper
manufacturing process.

29:56.070 --> 29:57.403
Can you
clean that up?

30:01.703 --> 30:02.870
It's an "A."

30:04.070 --> 30:08.603
It's Abex.

30:08.670 --> 30:10.037
We got to get
over there.

30:12.903 --> 30:14.270
We're looking for
Mitch Collett.

30:14.336 --> 30:15.937
<i>( gunshot and screaming )</i>

30:16.003 --> 30:17.603
Everybody down!

30:17.670 --> 30:20.503
Everybody downstairs!

30:20.570 --> 30:22.304
MITCH:
I've done everything for you.

30:22.369 --> 30:23.536
This is my wife.

30:23.603 --> 30:25.137
How does it feel

30:25.204 --> 30:26.570
to have your life
in somebody else's hands?

30:26.636 --> 30:28.503
Someone who doesn't
care if you die?

30:28.570 --> 30:29.870
Mitch, Mitch.

30:29.937 --> 30:32.469
Put the gun down.
Go, go.

30:32.536 --> 30:33.970
I asked him for the money
to save Brenda.

30:34.037 --> 30:35.304
You've got half a billion!

30:35.369 --> 30:36.703
Mitch, you're under
a lot of pressure.

30:36.770 --> 30:37.670
I don't know what
he's talking about.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.336
I can prove it!

30:39.403 --> 30:40.837
You ripped off the money.

30:40.903 --> 30:42.369
You made me hide
the paper trail.

30:42.436 --> 30:44.870
Mitch, this is not going
to help us find Brenda.

30:44.937 --> 30:45.970
Put it down.

30:46.037 --> 30:47.037
You said
you'd help me.

30:47.103 --> 30:48.570
I am going to help
you, Mitch,

30:48.636 --> 30:49.570
but I need time.

30:49.636 --> 30:51.037
I just need
a few more hours.

30:51.103 --> 30:54.603
Give me a few more
hours, Mitch.

30:54.670 --> 30:57.403
Mitch, please. Please.

30:57.469 --> 31:00.536
I just need
a few more hours.

31:00.603 --> 31:02.536
Do it for Brenda.

31:05.903 --> 31:07.536
Officers.

31:14.469 --> 31:15.870
I'm going to find her, Mitch.

31:15.937 --> 31:19.170
I'm going
to find her.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.917
Hey.
Hi.

31:47.449 --> 31:48.883
I heard Wolfe
asked you out.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.716
I heard you gave him
the go-ahead.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.549
The way I understood it,
it was the other way around.

31:54.616 --> 31:56.616
Right.

31:56.683 --> 31:58.350
So what are
you guys gonna do,

31:58.449 --> 32:01.384
you gonna drink
Midori cocktails?

32:01.449 --> 32:02.917
Watch movies on the couch?

32:02.983 --> 32:04.483
No, as a matter of fact,

32:04.549 --> 32:05.917
we're gonna go out in public

32:05.983 --> 32:07.716
'cause Ryan actually
made plans.

32:09.483 --> 32:11.350
Well, have fun
at the ballet.

32:11.416 --> 32:12.650
Wait a minute.

32:12.716 --> 32:13.983
You pimp me out
to your friend,

32:14.050 --> 32:15.650
and it's my fault?

32:15.716 --> 32:17.416
Pimped you out?

32:17.483 --> 32:18.917
Yeah, I'm cleared
for landing?

32:24.683 --> 32:25.816
It wasn't like that.

32:25.883 --> 32:28.217
But you said it, right?

32:30.950 --> 32:32.950
Okay...

32:33.017 --> 32:35.750
here's what I know.

32:35.816 --> 32:38.217
You and I actually had
a chance and you blew it.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.050
WOLFE:
Hey.

33:00.416 --> 33:03.217
Got some kind of trace
off of Brenda's earring.

33:03.284 --> 33:04.750
Looks like wax.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.416
Yeah, let's find out.

33:34.650 --> 33:35.816
Take a look.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.883
WOLFE:
Yeah, that's asbestos.

33:37.950 --> 33:38.950
It's pretty common.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.416
I'm not sure how that helps us.

33:40.483 --> 33:43.350
Wolfe, that's
your problem, man.

33:43.416 --> 33:45.317
You don't think big.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.250
What's that supposed to mean?

33:48.317 --> 33:50.816
It means you got a misdemeanor
mind in a felony world.

33:50.883 --> 33:53.150
We know the vic had
the earring on, okay?

33:53.217 --> 33:55.150
Chrysotile asbestos.

33:55.217 --> 33:57.616
It's used for its fire-retardant
and insulative abilities.

34:00.150 --> 34:02.750
Yeah, asbestos doesn't
just appear on its own.

34:02.816 --> 34:06.183
These fibers are fragmented,
they're splintered.

34:06.250 --> 34:08.449
For these asbestos
pieces to be broken,

34:08.516 --> 34:10.983
they'd have to be removed
from something.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.183
Older buildings.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.815
I put myself

34:13.882 --> 34:16.183
through college scraping
those cottage cheese ceilings.

34:16.250 --> 34:19.317
But there's got to be thousands
of buildings with that stuff.

34:19.384 --> 34:22.716
Abatement like that
requires a permit.

34:22.783 --> 34:24.083
Okay, I'll make a call
to the city.

34:24.150 --> 34:26.050
No, don't worry about it.
I know a guy.

34:35.449 --> 34:36.549
Valera...

34:36.616 --> 34:37.750
The M.E. log says

34:37.815 --> 34:38.716
that you have
the ear checked out.

34:38.783 --> 34:40.815
Yeah, it's right here.

34:40.882 --> 34:43.217
I really got to
look at this ear.

34:43.284 --> 34:45.284
Where does a guy get ahold
of an ear like this?

34:45.350 --> 34:46.416
Gravediggers?

34:47.815 --> 34:49.083
WOLFE:
No, it's too well kept.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.150
What do these look like to you?

34:52.317 --> 34:54.549
I don't know...

34:54.616 --> 34:55.882
piercings?

34:56.949 --> 34:59.750
No, the punctures are posterior,

34:59.816 --> 35:00.850
they're erratic,

35:00.917 --> 35:03.117
they're uneven.

35:04.350 --> 35:07.183
I think they were made
by a suture post mortem.

35:07.250 --> 35:09.883
Alexx said the ear was sliced
with something sharp,

35:09.950 --> 35:11.350
probably by an amateur.

35:11.416 --> 35:13.516
An amateur
with professional tools.
Yeah.

35:13.583 --> 35:16.217
Now Miami is the plastic surgery
capital, right?

35:17.650 --> 35:19.050
You gotta learn somewhere.

35:19.117 --> 35:22.516
Students practice on cadavers
at the university, right?

35:22.583 --> 35:24.950
Hello.
Hey, Alexx.
It's Ryan.

35:25.017 --> 35:28.083
I need to know who has access
to cadavers at the university.

35:38.616 --> 35:39.950
Your incision should rise

35:40.017 --> 35:42.549
just in front of
the cartilage of the ear,

35:42.616 --> 35:45.416
and around the sideburn.

35:45.483 --> 35:47.416
Good.

35:47.483 --> 35:50.816
Now make an incision just
under the rim of the helix

35:50.883 --> 35:52.217
in front of the ear...

35:52.284 --> 35:54.449
Excuse me.

35:54.516 --> 35:55.716
Can I help you
with something?

35:55.783 --> 35:57.650
You can't, but Jack can.

35:57.716 --> 35:58.917
Thought you worked
at a nightclub,

35:58.983 --> 36:00.050
Jack.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.183
Jack?

36:01.250 --> 36:02.416
Would you
excuse us please?

36:04.217 --> 36:05.516
Of course.

36:07.850 --> 36:09.816
That's my night job.

36:09.883 --> 36:10.950
I moonlight.

36:11.017 --> 36:13.750
Day job is disposing
of medical waste.

36:13.816 --> 36:15.416
Liposuction.

36:15.483 --> 36:17.783
Did you drop an ear
along the way?

36:17.850 --> 36:19.883
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:19.950 --> 36:22.017
Look, I'm earning
a living here, okay?

36:22.083 --> 36:23.716
Is that's a crime?
It's not a crime

36:23.783 --> 36:25.616
unless it's
a $5 million pay day.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.317
Where is she, Jack?
We know what happened.

36:27.384 --> 36:29.816
Rick hired Charlie,
you two partnered up.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.616
Then you
changed the plan.

36:31.683 --> 36:34.250
Are you crazy?
Come on, just
think about it.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.516
You bet big,
you win big.

36:36.583 --> 36:37.850
Its an opportunity
of a lifetime.

36:37.917 --> 36:39.850
Man, we are just
supposed to scare her.

36:39.917 --> 36:41.117
I'm calling this off.

36:44.217 --> 36:45.950
You say a word,

36:46.017 --> 36:48.750
I'll find you.

36:50.217 --> 36:51.783
So she's either
dead, Jack,

36:51.850 --> 36:53.816
or you've got her
stashed somewhere.
Which is it?

36:53.883 --> 36:55.017
Feel free to look around.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.284
Jack?
What?

36:56.350 --> 36:58.017
I'm gonna ask you again.
Where is she?

36:58.083 --> 37:00.317
<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

37:00.384 --> 37:01.616
This is Wolfe.

37:01.683 --> 37:02.816
Yeah.

37:02.883 --> 37:05.150
Hold on.
Just hold on.

37:05.217 --> 37:06.483
Okay, Jack...

37:06.549 --> 37:08.150
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

37:08.217 --> 37:09.516
What do I get for it?

37:11.217 --> 37:13.183
It's Delko.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.117
Jack here has
an asbestos permit.

37:15.183 --> 37:16.384
We've got an address.

37:16.449 --> 37:19.783
Okay, Jack, to answer
your question--

37:19.850 --> 37:21.616
you get a jail cell.
Officer...

37:21.683 --> 37:23.150
hook him up.

37:29.017 --> 37:31.983
<i>( sirens wailing )</i>

37:32.050 --> 37:33.850
<i>( garbled radio transmission )</i>

37:37.483 --> 37:39.616
Let's go.

38:06.816 --> 38:08.449
OFFICER:
Clear.

38:11.583 --> 38:13.250
Clear!

38:15.083 --> 38:16.317
OFFICER:
Clear.

39:01.284 --> 39:03.549
Brenda?

39:03.616 --> 39:05.883
I want you to lie still.

39:05.950 --> 39:08.150
<i>( gasps ):
I was so afraid
he was coming back.</i>

39:08.217 --> 39:10.516
Brenda, you're fine.
We got him.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.083
Your voice.
Yeah.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.816
I talked to you on the phone.

39:13.883 --> 39:14.950
That's right, that's me.

39:15.017 --> 39:16.449
Mr. Wolfe,
the paramedics, please.

39:16.516 --> 39:18.317
It made a difference.

39:18.384 --> 39:20.483
And I never can
thank you enough.

39:20.549 --> 39:21.616
You don't have to.

39:21.683 --> 39:23.616
Mr. Wolfe.
You hang in there.

39:23.683 --> 39:26.050
I want you
to lie still.
Okay.

40:01.917 --> 40:04.317
Hey.

40:04.384 --> 40:06.850
Do you have any cash?

40:06.917 --> 40:08.150
I left mine on the dresser,

40:08.217 --> 40:11.483
and Natalia and I
are leaving from here.

40:15.983 --> 40:17.150
You serious?

40:18.317 --> 40:19.416
Yeah.

40:21.983 --> 40:23.583
You want me to pay
for your date?

40:23.650 --> 40:26.050
I'll pay you back.

40:39.317 --> 40:41.583
Should be enough for
lobster and dessert.

40:43.449 --> 40:44.716
Thank you.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.384
Hi.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.317
How you doing?

40:53.384 --> 40:54.716
You ready to go
to dinner?

40:54.783 --> 40:55.850
Yeah.

40:55.917 --> 40:57.883
You like calamari?

40:57.950 --> 40:59.516
I... yes, I do.
You do?

41:23.284 --> 41:25.183
Slight pinch, okay?

41:28.883 --> 41:29.850
You okay?

41:29.917 --> 41:31.616
Okay.

41:40.150 --> 41:41.750
Are you ready?

41:51.217 --> 41:53.083
Okay, everything looks fine.

41:53.150 --> 41:54.983
I'll be down the hall
if you need anything.

41:55.050 --> 41:56.683
Thank you.
Thank you, nurse.

42:02.650 --> 42:03.750
She's great.

42:03.816 --> 42:06.017
Yeah.

42:09.350 --> 42:11.950
Here we go.

42:12.017 --> 42:15.516
Here we go.

42:20.549 --> 42:21.650
You know what?

42:21.716 --> 42:23.017
We're gonna be
here for awhile.

42:23.083 --> 42:26.384
Why don't you
get some rest, okay?

42:28.117 --> 42:29.816
Yeah.
Okay.

43:25.950 --> 43:27.683
Horatio?

43:27.750 --> 43:30.750
It's okay.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.416
I'm here.

43:32.483 --> 43:34.583
I'm here.
