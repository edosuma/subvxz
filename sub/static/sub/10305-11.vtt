00:10.360 --> 00:11.634
Peg, I got a problem.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.070
Nails drying.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.353
For once, why couldn't it be
pie cooling, bread baking?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.709
Divorce pending?

00:23.120 --> 00:28.035
<i>Look, Al, I am up from noon till Oprah,
solving this family's problems...</i>

00:28.240 --> 00:30.151
...and now I'm tired. I need a nap.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.794
Kelly, come hold my hands up.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.353
Dad.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.392
Now, I'll listen to your problem
if you help me with mine.

00:40.600 --> 00:44.673
<i>Son, your problems are simple.
Just avoid liquids past 9:00.</i>

00:47.160 --> 00:49.674
Dad, I'm not 16 anymore, all right?

00:50.400 --> 00:54.632
Life is a little more complicated.
I'm having serious girl trouble.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.308
Well, me too, Bud,
and it's going to remain that way...

00:57.520 --> 01:01.115
...unless the couch suddenly
develops a taste for human flesh.

01:01.680 --> 01:06.037
Dad, please. Now, lately I can't get
any girl to go out with me.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.835
Oh, now, Bud, I find that
hard to believe. I mean, look at you.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.952
But then again,
looks aren't everything.

01:13.720 --> 01:17.156
Personality is important,
so we'll skip that.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.909
So basically,
you have nothing to offer a woman.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.317
Son, what you have to do is lower
your standards. Think desperate.

01:24.520 --> 01:29.548
Think a single version of your mother.

01:30.520 --> 01:35.230
Thanks, Dad, thanks. Now I never, ever,
ever want to have sex again.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.190
Welcome to the club, son.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.435
Let's talk about my problem.
My boss, Gary, is crankier than ever.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.155
She's been riding me
like a cheap carnival pony.

01:47.360 --> 01:50.750
"Wait on the customers,
ring up the bills, don't steal. "

01:51.480 --> 01:53.630
What a shrew.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.517
Bud, this father-son stuff ain't bad.
We ought do this more often.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

02:45.280 --> 02:50.638
So are you going to settle on those,
ma'am? They look beautiful on you.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.833
Don't try those high-pressured
sales tactics on me.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.550
I really thought this mule
would look better in white.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.672
I bet that's what her husband said
on her wedding day.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.116
Do you have it in black?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.675
Ma'am, I would really
love to help you now...

03:08.880 --> 03:12.395
- ... but I just went on break.
- Well, what about him?

03:12.600 --> 03:15.273
Sorry, ma'am, I'm still on break.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.033
And just when exactly
is your break over?

03:20.240 --> 03:22.196
Well, it was gonna be
another 30 seconds...

03:22.400 --> 03:25.790
...but now that I just helped
a customer, I got to start all over.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.477
Rules are rules.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.356
You know what we need, Griff?
A break room.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.518
So we won't be bothered
by these hammertoed hags.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.678
- Men, I need to speak with you.
- See what I mean?

03:45.360 --> 03:47.999
Oh, let me take a wild guess.
You're on a break?

03:48.200 --> 03:51.397
Don't interrupt us,
or we'll have to start over.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.196
- You two are completely useless.
- We've noticed that ourselves.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.994
We don't feel
that we're properly motivated.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.077
Do you know
what would motivate us?

04:02.280 --> 04:04.236
A cattle prod?

04:05.040 --> 04:07.679
Well, yes, that, of course...

04:07.880 --> 04:10.997
...but I was thinking
more in the line of a break room.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.317
Oh, yes, a break room.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.398
<i>And I could throw in a big screen TV
and a fridge full of beer.</i>

04:17.600 --> 04:22.515
Hey, you're the boss.

04:24.040 --> 04:28.192
Yes, I am. And before I build you
that dreamy break room...

04:28.400 --> 04:33.155
...we're going to find out why
sales are down 500 percent this year.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.670
Could it be the strength
of the deutsche mark...

04:36.880 --> 04:39.110
...in today's international economy?

04:41.240 --> 04:43.913
Women are walking less?

04:48.240 --> 04:51.550
Nice try. Sit down, shut up.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.115
We three
are going to go over the books.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.998
Boy, that was close.
We almost got busted.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.237
Yeah. Good thing
we don't keep any books.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.953
Come on.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.468
Dad, I'm here.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.276
Looks good from here.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.799
I was just looking for my dad.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.070
Interesting place to look.

05:42.680 --> 05:46.150
- Maybe I should go find him.
- Oh, no rush. No rush.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.148
Well, well, well,
young Bud Bundy. Let's see.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.989
I haven't seen you since I threw
your family out of the company picnic.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.072
You have certainly turned
into a handsome young man.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.238
Your girlfriend
is a very lucky woman.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.116
Actually, I don't have a girlfriend.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.992
Really?

06:10.640 --> 06:11.629
I would have guessed...

06:11.840 --> 06:15.628
...that the ladies would be jumping
all over a studmuffin like yourself.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.519
Well, you know, I bag my share.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.798
You know,
I don't really want to be tied down.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.639
Well, don't knock it
till you've tried it.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.151
I think I hear my daddy calling me.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.874
Where's the fire,
besides in my secret places?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.558
What are you doing?

06:55.440 --> 06:56.953
You.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.077
- But-
- Don't fight it, Bud.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.589
Well, you could fight it a little.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.869
You are a genius, Al.
I can't believe that that worked.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.719
When you tell a retired couple
their house is on fire...

07:23.920 --> 07:26.832
...finishing their breakfast
just isn't a priority.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.158
Mom, Dad.
What are you two doing up?

07:33.360 --> 07:38.229
Looks like somebody
had a slumber party last night.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.716
So it looks like
you took your dad's advice...

07:41.920 --> 07:44.593
...and found yourself
a desperate one, huh?

07:45.640 --> 07:48.473
- What makes you think that?
- Beer and Tang.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.995
Bundy mimosas.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.838
Must be a classy chick, son.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.989
Yes, and she's painfully shy.

08:00.200 --> 08:04.193
So why don't you two head on upstairs,
and you can have breakfast in bed.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.951
Oh, he thinks
we're going to embarrass him.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.469
Come on, son,
we're not going to scare away...

08:11.680 --> 08:14.558
...a girl who's kind enough
to hang out with you.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.197
Hurry up with these mimosas,
Love Bud.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.709
I want to get out of here
before your pa-

08:28.040 --> 08:32.272
Daddy. Daddy, wake up. Daddy.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.835
- Honey, let me do it.
- Daddy.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.792
Al, wake up.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.031
Son touchy monster in jammies.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.548
Daddy, don't worry about it.

08:48.760 --> 08:53.595
Now, Bud is downstairs helping Gary
into her corrective undergarments.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.913
It's naked in the basement.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.599
Al, would you relax?

08:58.800 --> 09:00.677
You told Bud
to find somebody desperate.

09:00.880 --> 09:05.317
Well, when I said "aim low,"
I didn't think he'd excavate the tar pits.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.432
I don't know what the big deal is.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.313
I mean, lots of old rich people
like to date younger men.

09:12.520 --> 09:17.275
Look at Cher,
Roseanne, Richard Simmons.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.270
You're doing this to hurt me,
aren't you, Gary?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.198
You had it in for me since day one.

09:25.400 --> 09:29.473
Bundy, as much as you deserve it,
I am not doing this for revenge.

09:29.680 --> 09:34.629
I am doing it because
I am genuinely attracted to Bud.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.751
Oh, right,
like I'm supposed to believe that.

09:41.520 --> 09:47.152
You obviously don't know your son.
He's a wonderful human being.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.157
Who's his real father?

09:50.360 --> 09:55.434
Well, it's Al, but you know, that night
I was thinking about Lyle Waggoner.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.799
Old people always try to destroy
what they can't understand.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.549
Man, parents just don't get it,
do they?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.035
- It's all my fault.
- Oh, honey, don't blame yourself.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.309
You're right, Peg.

10:12.520 --> 10:17.116
It's all your fault.
You scarred him, Peg.

10:17.320 --> 10:21.916
How could I have scarred him?
I don't even remember talking to him.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.873
Peg, I'm telling you, he's looking
for the mother he never had.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.877
Oh, that's ridiculous.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.593
Blow.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.310
Good boy.

10:38.920 --> 10:43.710
So I told that punk son of my mine
and his gargoyle girlfriend...

10:43.920 --> 10:45.990
...I never wanted
to see them together again.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.350
You better not turn around.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.395
Looks like Bud can't get enough
of that hot gargoyle love.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.355
Bud is dead to me.

11:01.160 --> 11:06.393
Damn. Al, look at your son go.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.192
I have no son.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.792
Those two were knocking boots
right in your basement?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.070
I have no basement.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.717
You guys on a break? Good for you.

11:20.680 --> 11:26.949
Oh, Piglet, I almost forgot.
I got you a present.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.435
Thank you, Pooh Bear.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.195
When they start talking about
the honeypot, I got dibs on the sink.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.431
Monogrammed beeper?

11:41.640 --> 11:44.677
- What for?
- For when I need you.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.998
I may not be available.
I mean, I do have a life of my own.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.875
Oh, isn't that cute, Piglet.

11:53.080 --> 11:58.871
And just remember, when it reads 911,
Pooh Bear needs you bad.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.476
Say hello to Kanga and Roo for me.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.759
What'd you throw that for?

12:09.960 --> 12:13.191
Because the cash register's
bolted down.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.152
Al, lighten up.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.796
You didn't have a problem when Kelly
dated that wealthy older man.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.629
I wouldn't have a problem
if Bud dated a wealthy older man.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.910
Anybody but Gary.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.997
Hey, Al.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.750
I was in the tanning bed
and I heard about Bud and Gary, huh?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.518
It's all over the mall.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.439
- Let me guess. You're all for it, right?
- Natch.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.235
Who cares if Gary's a tarantula
in Chanel? I've seen worse.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.796
- You married worse.
- Exactly.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.070
Don't you see the beauty of this?

12:50.280 --> 12:54.796
Now that Bud has hitched his trailer
to Gary's sagging bumper...

12:55.840 --> 12:57.876
...you're in for a long ride
on easy street.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.196
No, no, no good can come of this.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.356
Where do you want this fridge
full of beers?

13:02.560 --> 13:05.393
Wherever. You don't understand
a father's feelings.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.636
This is the worst thing
that's happened to me.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.798
<i>- Where do you want the TV?
- I don't care. Put it near the fridge.</i>

13:11.000 --> 13:13.275
I'm telling you,
there's not a power on Earth...

13:13.480 --> 13:15.596
...that would make me accept
this unholy union.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.919
Gary sent us here
to build you guys a break room.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.189
But on second thought...

13:20.400 --> 13:23.039
...who am I to get in the way
of two crazy kids in love?

13:25.320 --> 13:26.673
Cheers!

13:30.520 --> 13:35.275
Oh, no. Maybe this
Bud and Gary thing is all my fault.

13:35.480 --> 13:40.349
Look, it says right here,
"What a mother does affects a child. "

13:44.360 --> 13:46.032
Kelly, was I a bad mother?

13:46.240 --> 13:48.959
I don't know. Whose mother are you?

13:49.160 --> 13:53.517
- Yours.
- Oh. Then were you terrible.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.870
Who are you to judge?
Hey, don't you remember that time...

13:59.080 --> 14:01.355
...I made you
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

14:01.560 --> 14:04.279
Mom, it was petroleum jelly.

14:06.080 --> 14:10.198
Yeah, and you didn't get chapped lips
that whole winter.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.630
And I always took care of you
when you were sick.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.034
Oh, please, Mom.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.038
The time I had chickenpox,
you slapped makeup on my face...

14:17.240 --> 14:19.151
...and sent me off to school.

14:19.360 --> 14:24.195
And you met your first little boyfriend
that day, now, didn't you?

14:24.400 --> 14:27.597
Yeah, Mikey Clemmons.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.395
Boy, naptime
was a lot more fun after that.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.431
Then I guess
I was not such a bad mother.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.235
I guess not with me. But, you know,
you really screwed up Bud.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.475
Peg, great news.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.199
You know Bud's horrible, perverted
affair with Gary that you caused?

14:48.520 --> 14:51.034
Yeah. I feel so guilty.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.994
<i>Like I should be on Court TV
with a blue dot on my face.</i>

14:55.200 --> 14:57.998
And yet in the bedroom
you complain about the paper bag.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.717
Anyway, Peg, don't worry about it...

15:00.920 --> 15:04.196
...because it's turned out to be
the greatest thing that happened to us.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.628
What are you talking about?

15:05.840 --> 15:08.718
I'm talking about
a break room, Peg, at work...

15:08.920 --> 15:11.718
...with massage tables
and a fridge full of beer.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.151
As long as Bud
keeps Gary happy, I'm happy.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.512
And as long as I'm happy, I'm happy.

15:20.440 --> 15:24.194
- Yeah, well, what about me?
- Don't be selfish, Peg.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.478
Well, what about Bud's welfare?

15:26.680 --> 15:29.956
Isn't this an unhealthy relationship
for our son?

15:30.160 --> 15:33.232
Look what else Gary
put in our break room.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.159
Belgian bonbons.

15:36.360 --> 15:40.751
Well, you know,
I always liked that Gary.

15:42.360 --> 15:47.480
Oh, look, Al, I'm using the good china
with the dividers.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.717
Good idea, Peg. Gary's a millionaire.
She's used to classy things.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.638
Now, if this relationship continues...

15:52.840 --> 15:54.796
...we're gonna be
eating off paper plates...

15:55.000 --> 15:56.956
...and then just throwing them away.

15:57.160 --> 16:01.358
Hey, which side
does the salad Spork go on again?

16:01.560 --> 16:06.076
- On the left. Who raised you?
- No one.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.438
How come you don't put out
the good plastic for my boyfriends?

16:09.640 --> 16:12.632
Because your boyfriends
don't use utensils.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.759
I'm so sick of this.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.633
You know, I'm the oldest.
Bud's always been your favourite.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.638
Just because he walked first,
and he talked first...

16:20.840 --> 16:23.070
...and he can name all 20 states.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.670
I will tell you-
I'll tell you what else he did first.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.313
He found himself a sugar daddy.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.080
Something we thought
you would do, young lady.

16:31.280 --> 16:35.990
Face it, Kelly, Bud beat you.
The dark horse came in first.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.191
Oh, now you got Bud a horse?

16:38.400 --> 16:40.436
Hey, I was the one
who always wanted a horsey.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.234
- Dad-
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, concentrate.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.910
If you help us tonight,
maybe Gary will buy you a horsey.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.749
Oh, no. If she's that rich
I want a unicorn.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.473
Fine.

16:58.960 --> 17:04.353
Somebody call heaven.
There's an angel missing.

17:04.560 --> 17:09.031
Oh, very, very nice, Bud.
Is this Baby Armani?

17:11.800 --> 17:14.233
Doesn't he look great, Al?

17:14.440 --> 17:17.272
You know, you remind me
of a very handsome young man...

17:17.480 --> 17:19.435
...that was once
madly in love with me.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.155
- You mean Daddy?
- Honey, I said handsome.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.035
And in love with her.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.910
I appreciate all the trouble
you went to...

17:32.120 --> 17:34.634
...but I'm not sure I feel right
about Gary and me.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.111
What are you talking about, Bud?

17:37.320 --> 17:40.710
You and Gary
are perfect for each other.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.195
Dad, she's getting more
and more possessive.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.072
I mean, we don't even talk anymore.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.840
I feel like all I am to her
is a piece of meat.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.632
My area. Let me handle this.

17:53.920 --> 17:59.995
Okay, Bud. So you're feeling
like a cheap sex toy, huh?

18:00.200 --> 18:03.476
Yeah. It's demeaning.
How do you handle it, Kel?

18:04.440 --> 18:08.194
I just accept it. I mean, come on.
Fish, they gotta swim.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.075
The birds gotta fly. Cookie Monster's
gotta eat whatever the hell he eats.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.475
You know what I mean? You know?

18:15.240 --> 18:16.753
No.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.475
Dad, how am I supposed to stay with
somebody who doesn't respect me?

18:20.680 --> 18:22.671
Honey, if marriage
was based on respect...

18:22.880 --> 18:25.917
...your father and I
would have never gotten together.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.348
That's right, pookie.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.549
Excuse me.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.672
- Who said anything about marriage?
- Well, Bud, you love Gary.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.555
- No, I don't, Dad.
- Don't talk back to your father.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.672
And love and marriage
go together like-

18:40.160 --> 18:42.116
Peg, what do love
and marriage go together?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.231
How the hell would I know?

18:45.240 --> 18:47.913
If you two are so happily married
let's see you kiss.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.477
Well, sure, we could do that...

18:52.680 --> 18:55.797
...but I think that years of love
and commitment...

18:56.000 --> 18:59.276
...can best be represented
by a hearty handshake.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.600
I said a kiss. That means lips.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.597
Sure.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.470
Oh, come on, Daddy,
you can do it. Just close your eyes.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.997
Bud, Bud, Bud, don't ruin this for me.

19:26.120 --> 19:31.114
Piglet, I've been paging you for over
an hour. Why didn't you call me back?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.436
Well, I turned off the beeper.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.551
- How dare you?
- Bud, you're grounded.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.037
What is it, Piglet?

19:44.480 --> 19:46.710
You know, we've had
some great times together...

19:46.920 --> 19:51.994
...and I appreciate everything
you've done for me, and to me.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.158
I think we should just be friends.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.193
- Do not listen to him.
- Wait a minute.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.038
You're dumping me?

20:00.240 --> 20:05.473
Without me, you will spend
the rest of your life in this hellhole.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.229
- No offence.
- None taken. Shall we have dinner?

20:09.440 --> 20:12.671
I can get out of this on my own.
I don't need to be anybody's boy toy.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.871
I'm going to make it
on brains and talent.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.436
Oh, Peg, we're never
going to get rid of him now.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.828
Go ahead, scoff.
At least I've got my dignity.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.430
Well, Bundy,
I guess you know what this means.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.313
Generic beer
in the break room fridge?

20:36.520 --> 20:38.397
Guess again.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.511
Less attractive masseuses?

20:40.720 --> 20:46.511
Try no beer, no massages.
In fact, no break room.

20:46.720 --> 20:50.315
And I'm installing a pay toilet.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.670
Oh, that's not right.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.189
I can't believe
I'm not going to get my unicorn.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.472
Oh, I can't believe
I polished Sporks for her.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.513
I can't believe I almost kissed you.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.234
This means that
Bud's not the favourite now, huh?

21:06.440 --> 21:07.634
Damn right.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.716
So that means
I'm the favourite now, right?

21:10.920 --> 21:12.273
Sure, why not?

21:12.480 --> 21:14.710
Look, Gary's gold card.

21:15.440 --> 21:20.878
Hey, forget the fried chicken.
Tonight it's fried lobster.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.117
Oh, wait a second.
Shouldn't we wait for Bud?

21:24.320 --> 21:27.118
What does he need lobster for?
He's got dignity.

21:28.305 --> 21:34.384
