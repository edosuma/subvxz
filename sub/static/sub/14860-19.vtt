00:01.376 --> 00:03.367
Guys, I am loving my job
at Chuckles & Huggs.

00:03.670 --> 00:04.910
It is great.
Who wants to see pics?

00:05.214 --> 00:05.954
Groan.
Groan.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.963
Groan.
Farting noise.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.419
Come on. What kind of monster
doesn't want to see a pic of me,

00:09.718 --> 00:11.254
a chubby Korean kid,

00:11.553 --> 00:13.385
and a state-of-the-art
bubblebot 9000 bubble machine?

00:13.680 --> 00:14.511
Me.
Me.

00:14.806 --> 00:15.796
Me.
Farting noise.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.760
But I'm doing
the gunnam style dance.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.471
You're not saying it right.
Gan-nam style?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.602
Ngam-ngam.
Gang-ang.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.479
You gotta swallow the
G's, the N's and the m.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.185
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)
Gangnam style.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.565
There it is.
Yes!

00:26.860 --> 00:28.191
Yeah,
| am just so happy

00:28.487 --> 00:29.818
that you found a job that
is so rewarding. Mm-hmm.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.319
Well, I love my job, too,

00:31.615 --> 00:32.901
but winter is
a terrible time

00:33.200 --> 00:34.531
for the food truck
industry.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.739
| mean, business has been
slower than a WNBA fast break.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.951
Tell me about it. Winter is
terrible for the store industry.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.740
Store industry?
Is that what it's called?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.785
Oh, Penny.
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.250
Hey, Max. You think I
could bum a bowl of cereal?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.587
Haven't had a carb in four
years. Feeling nostalgic.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.876
Oh, I remember that crouton.
You named it Sonya.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.510
(THUDDING)
Oh!

00:56.139 --> 00:57.550
Wow!

00:57.849 --> 00:59.886
Cereal prizes
have gotten awesome.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.516
Okay, you know what?
The phone is mine.

01:01.812 --> 01:02.847
| was hiding it
in the cereal box

01:03.146 --> 01:04.602
"cause I can't stop
texting Jason,

01:04.897 --> 01:06.559
this new hunk of butter
than I'm seeing.

01:06.858 --> 01:07.689
| texted him, like,
11 times last night.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.350
How is that even possible?

01:09.653 --> 01:12.020
Well, first, I texted him to
see if he wanted to go see that

01:12.322 --> 01:13.733
new gay Four Tops
cover band, the Four Tops.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.648
Not familiar.
Then he texted me back,

01:15.951 --> 01:16.691
"I'm actually more of
a Smokey Robinson man,"

01:16.994 --> 01:18.405
to which I texted him back,

01:18.704 --> 01:20.570
"| second that emoticon,"
smiley face. So... (LAUGHS)

01:20.872 --> 01:21.953
Then I texted him,
like, nine times

01:22.249 --> 01:23.205
to make sure
he got that joke.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.082
Maxima Herbert Blum,

01:25.377 --> 01:26.492
what if I were to tell you

01:26.795 --> 01:28.502
| knew a way for you
to stop texting Jason

01:28.797 --> 01:30.834
and regain all of the power
in your relationship?

01:31.133 --> 01:34.046
Well, Penny Aziz Hartz,
I'd tell you I'm intrigued.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.175
(DRAMATICALLY) Then I'd tell
you to come to my home tonight

01:35.470 --> 01:37.381
at 6:00 pm. Sharp.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.217
(DRAMATICALLY) Most likely because
she has a dramatic speaking class at 7:00,

01:39.516 --> 01:40.176
and it's too late
to cancel.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.806
(LAUGHS)

01:42.102 --> 01:43.684
Ooh. Would not eat
that cereal.

01:43.979 --> 01:44.764
It came with the apartment.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.599
Ugh. (GAGGING)

01:46.898 --> 01:48.809
(SPITS)
Careful, baby girl.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.020
(GASPS)

01:51.320 --> 01:52.856
Ooh, would not
drink that water.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.145
Pipes are ravaged with
tetanus. (SPUTTERS)

01:54.448 --> 01:55.279
Hope you got your shot!

01:55.574 --> 01:56.484
Ugh! (GASPS AND GRUNTS)

01:56.783 --> 01:57.773
Ooh! That is not vodka!

01:58.076 --> 01:59.157
It's a water sample
I'm collecting

01:59.453 --> 01:59.908
in my lawsuit
against the building.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.536
Ugh!

02:03.832 --> 02:04.788
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

02:05.083 --> 02:05.914
Ah. Idiot.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.908
Al, no!

02:08.211 --> 02:09.076
(MOUTH FULL) What?

02:09.378 --> 02:10.539
Oh. Right. the cereal.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.250
Ew!

02:12.549 --> 02:14.005
(BOWL THUDS)

02:14.301 --> 02:15.837
| got it. It's fine.
Hey, um...

02:16.136 --> 02:16.967

Toilet water.

02:19.264 --> 02:19.799
(SWALLOWS) We're all good.

02:30.859 --> 02:31.724
Good day for your
boy Ethan, man. Yeah.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.064
He was a lord
on the big boy slide.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.478
And he really seems
to have gotten a handle

02:35.781 --> 02:37.897
on that whole biting
other kids' mouths problem.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.032
Why does he do that?
| don't know. It's weird.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.613
Yeah. Well, I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

02:41.912 --> 02:42.492
Take care.
All right.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.822
Take care, Cody.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.660
Way to own
that ball pit today, Sarah.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.199
See you later,
menacing repo men.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.493
Wait.

02:50.796 --> 02:51.831
What are you guys doing?

02:52.130 --> 02:55.168
No payments, no bubbles.
Sorry, babe.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.925
Did you just
call me "babe"?

02:58.220 --> 03:00.131
Hey, Terry, um,
some repo guys said

03:00.430 --> 03:01.044
we haven't been making
our bubblebot payments.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.055
Is everything okay?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.466
Brad, when my partner Robert
Huggs and | opened this place

03:05.769 --> 03:07.259
in early March 2010,

03:07.562 --> 03:09.269
the last thing
| ever thought would happen

03:09.564 --> 03:12.522
is that my partner Robert Huggs
would die in late March 2010.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.526
Oh. He was a business
mind. | was a dreamer.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.563
Right. Um...
So what, that...

03:18.865 --> 03:20.355
We're just a little behind
on our bills? Or...

03:20.659 --> 03:22.366
We're not gonna close
or anything?

03:22.661 --> 03:24.277
(BOTH LAUGHING) Right?
We're not gonna close.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.946
Brad, I can't say for certain if
we're gonna stay open or close,

03:27.249 --> 03:29.160
but I can say for sure
we're probably gonna close.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.324
(PATS ARM)

03:33.130 --> 03:34.245
Um...

03:34.548 --> 03:35.413
What?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.252
(PANTING)

03:39.636 --> 03:40.467
Did you run here?

03:40.762 --> 03:43.504
No. I took a cab.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.469
So... What's your secret
solution to my texting problem?

03:46.768 --> 03:48.884
Jason's got all the power
in your relationship,

03:49.187 --> 03:51.098
and if you want it back,
it's simple.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.607
You just need to not
text him until he texts you.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.359
(WHINES) | can't. I really,
really, really wanna text him.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.361
Everything I see
reminds me of him...

03:59.656 --> 04:01.317
A train going through a
tunnel, an oil rig exploding,

04:01.616 --> 04:03.357
two gay guys having sex.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.822
You are watching way too
much stock footage and gay porn,

04:06.121 --> 04:07.282
and I can't fix that,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.117
but I can fix
your power problem.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.908
Noche Tussin.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.747
My mom got it from Mexico

04:15.046 --> 04:15.911
because it's discontinued
in the States

04:16.214 --> 04:17.454
and in Mexico,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.464
which is why the Mexicans
smuggle it from Nicaragua,

04:19.760 --> 04:21.171
where it's also illegal.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.177
It's made in Libya
in a neighborhood of Tripoli

04:23.472 --> 04:24.462
called "little Mexico."

04:24.765 --> 04:27.097
"Warning! Good luck."

04:27.392 --> 04:29.884
Night's the toughest time
not to text, right? Mmm-hmm.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.474
So you just down a dose
before dinner and sleep a tight 14.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.729
You can't text
while you're sleepin'!

04:34.024 --> 04:34.809

Look, I'll even
do it with you.

04:38.945 --> 04:39.525

all the time.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.061
Pete's off on a golf trip,

04:41.364 --> 04:43.651

him about wedding details.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.033
| don't wanna seem needy.
| wanna seem powerful.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.036
Okay, Pen,

04:49.331 --> 04:50.492
and I appreciate
you helping me,

04:50.791 --> 04:52.373
but I don't need
to knock myself clear out

04:52.667 --> 04:54.408
to avoid texting someone.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.748
Really? Because you're purposely
pocket texting him right now.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.229

15:53.369 --> 15:54.575
Oh, Terry told me you
used to work in finance?

15:54.871 --> 15:56.487
Terry says a lot of things.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.075
Yesterday, he told me he's
concerned he may be immortal.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.489
That is concerning.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.409

What are you doing?
I'm interventioning you.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.182
No, that's impossible,
because I'm interventioning you.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.892
(SCOFFS)

17:47.191 --> 17:49.057
BOTH: "You've disappointed me
in the following ways, Dad!"

17:49.360 --> 17:50.896
Wait. Did you say "Dad"?
You said "Dad," too.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.356

from interventiontemplates.com?

17:52.655 --> 17:53.861
Yeah.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.443
(LAUGHS) What are we doing?

17:56.742 --> 17:57.732
We're being a couple
of world-class idiots.

You know what?

18:01.998 --> 18:03.580
Since I've been up
for three consecutive hours,

18:03.874 --> 18:05.956
I'm starting to think my
power theory was a little wack.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.335
Yeah, and that Mexican
sleeping juice? Phew!

18:09.630 --> 18:11.291
It has done a number on the
old central nervous system.

Check this out.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.124
Nothin'.
It's not on.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.010
That's another thing.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.420

is on or off anymore.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.884
Welp...
(CHUCKLES)

18:20.182 --> 18:20.887

Thank god you're okay.
| was so worried.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.178
You didn't answer
any of my texts,

18:27.481 --> 18:28.186
so I canceled
the rest of my trip,

18:28.482 --> 18:29.768
and I came home
as soon as I could.

18:30.067 --> 18:30.852
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.688
We were doing
this whole power thing.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.853
And it's so stupid. It
just...it got out of hand.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.022
And honestly, I'm so
sorry. I'm so stupid.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.404
Everybody, everyone...

Hey, listen up.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.458
So here's the deal.

18:49.754 --> 18:50.664
But I love it here so much,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.704
and you all mean
so much to me,

18:53.007 --> 18:55.795
so I decided to turn it down
and stay here with you guys.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.800
Really? In this economy?

18:58.095 --> 18:58.960
You gotta think
long term, bro. Um...

19:00.473 --> 19:02.214
Yeah. You gotta
make that skrillah

19:02.516 --> 19:04.006

to this vanilla.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.425
BOY: Yeah.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.526
| mean, Whoopi was great
at mixing it up

19:15.821 --> 19:18.028
with those very troubled
inner city Catholics,

19:18.324 --> 19:21.066
but she was still a Vegas
lounge singer at heart.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.279
And you're a businessman
at heart.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.695

19:41.347 --> 19:42.508

knowledge you taught me,

19:42.807 --> 19:44.969
and that $2.5 million
| inherited

19:45.267 --> 19:47.725
when my Aunt Doris was crushed
by that satellite.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.636
Right.
Mmm, yeah.
