WEBVTT

00:47.798 --> 00:49.675
-Morning.
-Morning.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.520
What's this?

01:01.979 --> 01:03.981
It's just some paperwork for you to sign.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.741
What? You're canceling our cruise
to the Bahamas?

01:14.825 --> 01:17.619
If you're going back to space,
it doesn't make much sense, does it?

01:18.120 --> 01:20.539
-Wait, what?
-So which mission is it gonna be?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.959
You've already been to the moon,
so that's out of the question.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.628
And Skylab, you know, is doing good work,

01:26.712 --> 01:29.381
but let's be honest,
it's far too boring for you.

01:29.464 --> 01:34.553
So I'm guessing
the first flight of Pathfinder, yeah?

01:35.554 --> 01:38.015
I mean, you know,
it's cutting-edge technology

01:38.098 --> 01:40.225
filled with stuff that can malfunction.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.060
It's a test pilot's dream.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.442
Karen, I'm not going back.
I'm perfectly happy--

01:48.525 --> 01:49.568
No, you're not, Ed.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.279
You made that very clear last night.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.656
What are you talking about?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.742
You said you made a promise to yourself

01:56.825 --> 01:59.161
that you would never
leave me and Kelly alone,

01:59.244 --> 02:01.580
no matter what you had to give up.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.711
Come on.
I was very upset, and I overreacted.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.630
And you said exactly what you feel.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.093
-What I meant was--
-I know what you meant, Ed.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.807
It's not just... that.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.564
You don't think I notice
the look in your eyes at every launch.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.651
Or when you talk about Pathfinder.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.373
We raised a wonderful daughter.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.628
And you've been there for her
every step of the way.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.049
And now she's going off
to live her dreams,

02:54.132 --> 02:56.134
and there's no reason
that you shouldn't too.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.599
I won't put you through that again.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.684
I can handle it.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.817
But you should know,
it's gonna be different this time.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.863
You know, I have a business to run.

03:16.989 --> 03:20.367
So I can't sit by a squawk box all day
and night wondering if you're okay.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.287
It's not that I don't support you.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.664
I do.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.333
I can't get sucked into all of that again.

03:29.793 --> 03:30.794
I can't.

03:33.922 --> 03:34.923
Then...

03:36.175 --> 03:37.384
I shouldn't go.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.468
Yes, you should.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.765
Do you really think you can
sit behind a desk from 8:00 to 6:00

03:43.849 --> 03:45.809
for another 15 years?

03:54.776 --> 03:55.777
You really think--

03:55.861 --> 03:58.197
Yes. I do.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.371
I said I can handle it.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.290
And I will.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.597
Sometimes you just gotta stop
wringing your hands...

06:30.140 --> 06:31.934
and fly, or nothing gets done.

06:33.602 --> 06:34.811
Roger that, Gordo.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.065
It's refreshing
to have you back in the saddle.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.149
It's good to be back.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.569
I miss you hard chargers. Test pilots.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.697
Yeah, we like to push everything
to the fire wall, all right.

06:45.781 --> 06:46.782
Amen.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.079
You good with this suit, Gordo?

06:52.162 --> 06:55.999
If not, we could put you
into one of the old A7LB's.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.084
I like it.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.212
Can raise my hands a lot higher.

07:01.129 --> 07:05.259
Gotta say though,
don't much like this turtle shell.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.010
Durability comes with a price.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.512
But be sure you're comfortable.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.430
You'll be spending a lot of time
in one of these.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.100
Loving every minute, thinking of you.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.685
You never give up, do you?

07:15.018 --> 07:17.020
Charm looms large in my legend.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.651
Just the brain bucket
and you're ready to rock.

07:22.734 --> 07:23.735
About time.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.419
You okay? All good?

07:58.520 --> 07:59.855
I can't hear you.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.278
Comm's on.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.655
Gordo, are you okay in there?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.282
Yeah, I'm good.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.826
Comm's cut out.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.589
-You look a little flushed.
-Yeah, it's kinda hot in there.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.133
We'll swap out the CCA
and get you rolling inside ten minutes.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.426
That's a no go.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.762
Might have to scrub this for today.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.222
I just remembered
I'm due over at building 9.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.683
I gotta take a leak,
and I'm not gonna use the damn MAG.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.085
I'm telling you, Dan, keep an eye on her.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.254
I know Annapolis
has changed and everything,

09:05.337 --> 09:07.005
but it hasn't changed that much.

09:07.506 --> 09:11.593
Don't let any of those midshipmen
razz my daughter, okay?

09:12.094 --> 09:13.262
Aye, aye, sir.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.015
Hey, hey! Where you going with that?

09:19.810 --> 09:21.311
-Hi, Bob.
-Hi, Bob.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.396
Hi, Bob!

09:23.438 --> 09:24.439
Grab a glass.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.735
What are we celebrating?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.238
Well...

09:31.321 --> 09:35.075
two old-timers managed to finish first
and second on their proficiency tests.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.618
I will drink to that.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.709
Y'all did good.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.211
Waxed the tails
of those pimply-faced rookies.

09:47.296 --> 09:48.297
Expected nothing less.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.799
Okay, now what are we drinking to
this time?

09:51.842 --> 09:56.305
Someone we all know and love
and deeply admire.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.056
One of the greatest,

09:58.140 --> 10:01.393
if... not the greatest astronaut
of our time

10:01.476 --> 10:04.605
has decided to return to space
and command Pathfinder.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.815
Neil Armstrong.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.317
Frank Sedgewick.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.068
Fuck y'all. I'm going back.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.071
We heard. We heard.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.032
Yeah, word travels fast.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.453
Hey, I thought you didn't miss it
and you had no desire to go back?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.371
You inspired me.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.833
So, you gave yourself Pathfinder.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.085
Must be nice to be king.

10:27.169 --> 10:32.007
What can I say? I got an eye
for spotting talent, like with you guys.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.385
I meant what I said. Y'all did great.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.472
I mean, that's a bit of a challenge.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.934
After all those years,
just jump right back into the deep end

10:42.017 --> 10:44.728
and making it look easy.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.148
It's impressive.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.111
You okay, Gordo?

10:54.446 --> 10:55.447
Yeah.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.409
Something I should know about?

10:59.493 --> 11:00.494
No.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.248
Okay.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.001
I mean-- It's just...

11:09.628 --> 11:12.840
I had a weird little moment
in my suit today.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.344
-Weird moment? Where?
-Like what?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.388
It was nothing. It was just...

11:20.764 --> 11:24.101
I felt trapped and short of breath and...

11:25.352 --> 11:26.353
I had to...

11:31.275 --> 11:32.693
I had to take my helmet off.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.033
-Yeah.
-Did you tell anybody else about this?

11:40.117 --> 11:41.118
Course not.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.334
You didn't... see anything?

11:49.418 --> 11:51.128
Oh, no. No, it was nothing like that.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.840
Trust me, it's just, you know,

11:55.382 --> 11:57.176
like I said, felt a little hemmed in.

11:57.593 --> 11:58.594
Yeah.

12:02.848 --> 12:06.935
Look, what happened up there
was nine years ago.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.521
You're not that guy.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.440
-I know.
-You're a different person now.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.026
And you've been to therapy.
You've dealt with your issues.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.360
Oh, yeah. I know.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.363
You finally cut the cord with Tracy.

12:18.447 --> 12:21.992
I mean, you're on the upswing, buddy.
You're getting your mojo back!

12:22.075 --> 12:24.077
I am. I haven't felt this good in years.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.205
-It was just a moment, is all.
-Yeah.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.289
No biggie.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.666
-Good. Good. Glad to hear it.
-No biggie.

12:38.634 --> 12:39.801
How you holding up?

12:41.178 --> 12:43.889
Fine. Feels good to be back.

12:46.475 --> 12:49.269
I gotta go to Dallas
to see Clayton's sister tomorrow,

12:49.978 --> 12:51.480
take care of some family business.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.065
Really not looking forward to it.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.816
All right.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.987
So, Ed, now that you are stepping out...

12:59.947 --> 13:01.949
who's taking over the Astronaut Office?

13:10.249 --> 13:11.250
Molly?

13:12.501 --> 13:14.086
Ed? Is that you?

13:14.169 --> 13:15.170
Yep.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.922
Come on in. I'm in here.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.310
You always leave the door open
while you're bathing alone?

13:30.394 --> 13:31.728
Who says I'm alone?

13:33.230 --> 13:37.401
Golly gee.
Visitation from the chief astronaut.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.027
To what do I owe this honor?

13:39.111 --> 13:43.657
You missed our golf game again,
so I thought I'd check in.

13:43.740 --> 13:47.494
Right. You wanna get a beer
before you drop the other shoe, or...

13:51.123 --> 13:54.501
No. I'm just... Well, a beer is fine.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.262
Forgive me for not getting up.
Gravity's a bitch.

14:10.809 --> 14:15.564
I'm here to put you back to work.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.817
This wild, happy, free life
has got to stop.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.449
Why do I think I am not gonna like this?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.284
Because you know me.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.454
I want you to run the Astronaut Office.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.126
Me run the Astronaut Office.
What the hell for?

14:36.210 --> 14:38.670
Well, someone just put me
in command of Pathfinder.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.964
Wow.

14:41.924 --> 14:46.345
You just assigned yourself the command
of the E ticket ride of the decade.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.682
Yep. Just like you told me to.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.935
Jesus Christ.
You weren't supposed to listen to me.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.394
I was just messing with you.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.562
Well, you were right.

14:55.646 --> 14:59.525
And assigning your own missions
is one of the perks of the job.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.570
That's a pretty ballsy move, Ed.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.031
You've never flown a shuttle.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.283
No one's flown Pathfinder.

15:09.326 --> 15:13.372
Looks to me like you just handed yourself
a golden opportunity to screw the pooch.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.541
Always the optimist.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.043
So what do you say?

15:18.377 --> 15:21.880
I say no to that crown of thorns.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.591
Look, don't overlook the upside.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.760
Homage from favor seekers.

15:26.844 --> 15:30.264
Opportunities to wreak vengeance
on people who cross you.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.102
That sounds fun.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.771
But no. No.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.315
I just wanna fly.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.775
So, fly.

15:43.735 --> 15:47.197
You assign your own flights.
When your six-month medical hold ends...

15:51.451 --> 15:52.703
I pull a Baldwin?

15:53.537 --> 15:55.998
Put myself in the coolest thing flying?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.004
You bastard.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.133
You start in a week.
You can thank me later.

16:06.758 --> 16:10.137
A bottle of Glenfarclas 25 would be nice.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.222
Although Glenfiddich never disappoints.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.606
Molly Cobb...

16:22.107 --> 16:24.568
chief of the Astronaut Office.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.534
No way.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.831
I want you to know
I appreciated your call.

16:38.749 --> 16:41.084
We never got a chance to talk
at the funeral.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.587
-I wanted to--
-You said you have something for me.

16:45.464 --> 16:46.465
Yes.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.136
I finally worked up the nerve
to go through Clayton's closet.

16:51.762 --> 16:54.723
This was on the floor, shoved in the back.

16:55.766 --> 16:59.728
There are some personal items in here
I thought you might want.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.692
These are some of Clayton's report cards
from elementary school.

17:12.491 --> 17:16.703
These are some birthday cards
your mother wrote to him.

17:28.257 --> 17:29.842
Thank you for bringing me these.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.600
I know you and I
haven't always seen eye to eye,

17:39.518 --> 17:44.439
but I'm hoping we can find a way
to make a fresh start.

17:46.984 --> 17:47.985
Why?

17:50.404 --> 17:52.114
Because we both loved Clayton.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.412
What's that supposed to mean?

17:59.204 --> 18:03.166
I know you wanted him to admire you,
worship the ground you walked on.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.335
Is that what you call love?

18:05.419 --> 18:07.045
That's not at all what I--

18:09.423 --> 18:10.507
You don't know me.

18:11.884 --> 18:14.261
-You never bothered to.
-I know you, all right.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.056
Clayton told me
what really happened on the moon.

18:21.685 --> 18:22.686
What?

18:24.229 --> 18:26.273
-He wouldn't.
-He's never kept secrets from me.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.276
Told me how you really broke your arm.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.531
All to protect some white man's career.

18:34.615 --> 18:39.369
That man was my friend.
A part of my crew.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.705
The color of his skin
had nothing to do with it.

18:41.788 --> 18:45.542
And look how they've rewarded you.
Made you a laughingstock.

18:45.626 --> 18:48.337
If that were true, why would they send me
back to the moon?

18:50.005 --> 18:51.215
You're going again?

18:54.051 --> 18:55.260
Well, that's just great.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.347
You're gonna help them spend millions

18:58.430 --> 19:00.474
to find out if beans
will sprout on the moon.

19:00.557 --> 19:04.269
If they'd used that money to fund
a decent counseling program at the VA,

19:04.353 --> 19:06.104
maybe Clay wouldn't have killed himself.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.276
I don't know why I thought this time
would be any different.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.903
You are never gonna change.

19:14.780 --> 19:15.781
Hold on.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.825
I've got something for you too.

19:32.381 --> 19:33.465
This was Clay's?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.472
But he threw away all his medals.
I saw him do it.

19:40.556 --> 19:41.557
Not this one.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.309
-How did you--
-He gave it to me.

19:47.938 --> 19:49.022
I don't understand.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.608
Why are you giving this to me?

19:52.359 --> 19:55.237
You're the one who filled Clay's head
with all that patriotic crap.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.657
He joined the army because of you.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.910
He joined the army to serve his country.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.328
His country?

20:04.454 --> 20:06.290
He ever tell you
what his fellow soldiers did

20:06.373 --> 20:08.625
the day after Martin Luther King
was assassinated?

20:08.709 --> 20:09.918
They threw a party.

20:10.586 --> 20:14.214
Put on Klan outfits,
paraded around with Confederate flags.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.551
But, hey, they gave Clay a medal,
so that makes it all okay.

20:17.634 --> 20:21.263
-That wasn't the men in Clay's platoon.
-I'm not talking about his platoon.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.891
I'm talking about
the United States government.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.603
Uncle Sam used us as cannon fodder.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.272
Clayton was proud to serve.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.356
At first.

20:31.732 --> 20:35.819
But by the time he got back, he was just
putting on a good show to please you.

20:35.903 --> 20:38.572
He did everything for you.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.241
And now that's he's gone,
all you wanna do is forget him.

20:41.825 --> 20:42.826
Well, go ahead.

20:43.535 --> 20:46.413
Go back to the moon,
help them start another Vietnam up there.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.497
That is not--

20:48.665 --> 20:52.920
We are doing serious research
to build a better future for us all.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.380
You sound just like them.

20:56.632 --> 20:58.717
But you're not one of them. Never will be.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.847
They may have let you on the bus, but you
will always have to ride in the back.

21:14.525 --> 21:16.735
I know I've already brought this up...

21:18.320 --> 21:19.321
but...

21:20.322 --> 21:22.366
the moon was supposed to be
a stepping-stone,

21:22.449 --> 21:24.284
and it's become a quagmire,

21:24.368 --> 21:26.954
sucking up more and more
of our funding and resources--

21:27.037 --> 21:30.082
That's true, but the president doesn't
want the Soviets to gain the upper hand.

21:30.165 --> 21:31.250
Neither do I.

21:31.834 --> 21:34.962
If we put boots on the surface of Mars,
we'll have the ultimate upper hand.

21:39.925 --> 21:42.386
-What?
-You know what your problem is, Ellen?

21:43.971 --> 21:45.848
You're not fooling anyone.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.105
What do you mean?

21:53.897 --> 21:56.066
You need to be a better poker player.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.235
You remember a couple years back

21:58.318 --> 22:01.154
when Senator Lang attacked
the cost overruns of our lunar program?

22:01.238 --> 22:02.865
Yeah, he called it a "moondoggle."

22:04.408 --> 22:05.909
I wrote that speech for him.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.042
Why would you do that?

22:14.126 --> 22:16.587
Lang was in the middle of
a tough reelection fight.

22:16.670 --> 22:17.838
Yeah, I remember.

22:18.422 --> 22:21.049
Coen accused him of being a pimp for NASA.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.677
And John needed to demonstrate
his independence.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.347
We already had more than enough votes
to pass the funding bill,

22:27.431 --> 22:29.057
so why not help him out?

22:29.474 --> 22:31.101
Then, after he won reelection--

22:31.185 --> 22:34.438
Lang turned around and sponsored the bill

22:34.521 --> 22:37.649
that allows NASA to license
its new technology to private industry.

22:37.733 --> 22:38.942
And because of that,

22:39.443 --> 22:43.113
this agency will be entirely self-funded
in less than ten years.

22:43.197 --> 22:45.407
Which will free us
from the whims of Congress.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.491
Exactly.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.994
We'll have enough money to explore Mars.

22:49.745 --> 22:50.913
And we won't stop there.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.165
You and I will have a front row seat.

22:54.249 --> 22:56.502
As long as the Democrats
don't win next year.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.382
That must've been pretty difficult.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.593
Being at the center of everything,

23:04.676 --> 23:07.596
and then Teddy Kennedy wins
and you're out of a job.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.890
Just part of the game. The ups and downs.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.478
Was it Nixon who initially recruited you?

23:14.561 --> 23:15.812
No.

23:15.896 --> 23:19.608
No, no one recruited me.
I lobbied my ass off for this job.

23:22.861 --> 23:23.946
Really?

23:25.030 --> 23:27.866
Caught the bug when I was aboard
a submarine during the war.

23:31.286 --> 23:34.248
We'd surface at night
to recharge our batteries.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.626
Yeah, out there,

23:38.335 --> 23:42.339
alone in the Pacific,
the sky was packed with stars.

23:44.258 --> 23:47.386
We learned the names of quite a few
to navigate, but...

23:49.221 --> 23:51.098
I wanted to know them all.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.979
After I got demobbed, I went out
and bought my first telescope...

23:58.313 --> 23:59.439
from the Sears catalog.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.613
-Shall I freshen you up?
-Sure.

24:12.244 --> 24:15.873
I didn't know you felt
so passionately about space.

24:19.543 --> 24:20.669
I guess I thought--

24:20.752 --> 24:23.297
What? That I'm a glad-handing politician

24:23.380 --> 24:25.924
who cares more about my career
than I do about NASA?

24:28.302 --> 24:30.804
Nah, it's okay, El.

24:30.888 --> 24:33.765
I know everyone at JSC
thinks I'm just Reagan's lackey,

24:34.224 --> 24:36.727
just like they thought I was
Nixon's lackey a decade ago.

24:36.810 --> 24:37.895
But I don't mind it.

24:39.897 --> 24:43.525
People have hated politicians as long as
there have been politicians, but...

24:45.152 --> 24:46.153
the truth is...

24:47.696 --> 24:49.698
we're the ones
that make this all possible.

24:52.618 --> 24:55.746
I wanna get to Mars as much as you do.
Believe me.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.585
You're gonna be a great asset to me,
Ellen.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.380
You're as genuine as the sunrise.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.008
People respond to that.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.055
Thank you, Tom. That's very kind.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.557
You'll get used to all the gamesmanship.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.435
We all play different roles
with different people.

25:18.519 --> 25:21.688
I'm a different Thomas Paine with Reagan
than I was with Nixon

25:21.772 --> 25:25.400
or Tip O'Neill or Margo Madison.

25:25.943 --> 25:29.530
And there's yet another me with my wife
when I go home at night.

25:36.537 --> 25:40.165
The trick is
not to lose track of who you really are.

25:46.755 --> 25:49.174
It's Scorsese's best picture.

25:49.258 --> 25:51.343
-You cannot be serious.
-It's a masterpiece.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.720
Oh, my. You're saying that
'cause you like Jerry Lewis.

25:53.804 --> 25:55.430
What's not to like?

25:55.514 --> 25:56.515
Everything.

25:58.392 --> 26:01.395
The Nutty Professor
is a brilliant indictment

26:01.895 --> 26:03.272
of the American male psyche.

26:03.355 --> 26:06.358
Okay, yours maybe.
I do not get this obsession at all.

26:06.441 --> 26:09.152
Says the guy who's seen Yentl 15 times.

26:09.236 --> 26:11.238
-That's so--
-Hey, El.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.407
How'd your day go?

26:13.490 --> 26:15.993
It was very interesting.

26:16.076 --> 26:19.496
Hey, we should go.
We don't wanna miss that first set.

26:21.248 --> 26:22.541
Where you guys off to?

26:22.624 --> 26:23.709
The Bullshot.

26:24.418 --> 26:27.963
They apparently have
a fantastic Donna Summer impersonator.

26:28.505 --> 26:29.840
-You should come with.
-Yeah.

26:29.923 --> 26:33.468
I'd love to,
but I have an 0800 meeting at JSC.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.971
You could stay for an hour,
then head home.

26:36.972 --> 26:39.433
You really should get out more,
have some fun.

26:39.516 --> 26:41.059
Yeah, come on.

26:42.895 --> 26:43.896
Another time.

26:45.105 --> 26:50.194
Okay. Well, if you're staying,
maybe you can go through your moon mail.

26:50.277 --> 26:52.571
You haven't touched it
since you've been back.

26:54.990 --> 26:56.617
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.203
-Have fun.
-You too.

27:00.412 --> 27:01.747
That's a lot of mail.

28:57.571 --> 29:00.699
Discovery, Launch Control.
We're gonna run abort check now.

29:00.782 --> 29:01.783
Wilco.

29:01.867 --> 29:03.285
Looks good, Control.

29:05.495 --> 29:09.291
That brings us to the built-in hold
at T-minus nine minutes.

29:09.374 --> 29:11.919
Time for Tracy's big interview with NBC.

29:12.002 --> 29:14.713
Starting to wonder
if we're just chauffeurs here.

29:15.881 --> 29:18.592
Think they left a makeup case
on the mid-deck if you wanna freshen up.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.636
Yeah. Very funny, y'all.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.433
Launch Control,
we have power to the Tracy cam.

29:27.434 --> 29:29.311
Roger, Discovery. Feed looks good.

29:31.271 --> 29:35.317
Okay. You're live in three, two, one.

29:36.276 --> 29:37.319
Hey there.

29:37.903 --> 29:42.282
Well, I am very happy to be talking to you
aboard the space shuttle Discovery.

29:43.367 --> 29:46.495
That's right,
I'm headed for six months on the moon.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.539
It's the trip of a lifetime.

29:48.622 --> 29:51.625
Only one regret, Sam and I
couldn't make it our honeymoon.

29:52.292 --> 29:55.379
A number of viewers have asked
why you're still using "Stevens"

29:55.462 --> 29:57.631
instead of your married name, "Cleveland."

29:57.714 --> 29:58.799
Care to tell us why?

29:58.882 --> 30:02.135
Well, you know,
everybody already knows me as Stevens.

30:02.219 --> 30:03.971
So, figured I'd stick with it.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.764
Save the taxpayers some money.

30:06.348 --> 30:07.724
I love you bunches, Sam.

30:09.059 --> 30:12.229
Astronaut Tracy Stevens,
speaking with us 40 minutes ago

30:12.312 --> 30:15.440
as she and her crew
made their final preparations for launch.

30:16.108 --> 30:18.944
I'm now being told the shuttle
is a mere two minutes from liftoff--

30:20.362 --> 30:22.447
Thank you. Thank you very much.

30:22.531 --> 30:24.616
Welcome to Wheel of Fortune.
Good to have you here.

30:24.700 --> 30:28.495
And now if you would do that one more time
for our hostess. Here comes Vanna White.

30:28.579 --> 30:29.580
Vanna.

30:30.873 --> 30:31.874
Hello.

30:31.957 --> 30:34.793
...only hope they don't get to our ships
before we do.

30:38.422 --> 30:40.299
-The air pressure's dropping.
-You're right.

30:40.382 --> 30:42.509
Father of two. You care to talk
about those two a little bit?

30:42.593 --> 30:43.635
Two fantastic kids.

30:43.719 --> 30:46.805
One under a year, still a baby, and then
a beautiful three-year-old daughter

30:47.431 --> 30:49.141
given to me by my gracious wife.

30:49.224 --> 30:50.350
-Well, it was...
-Two wonderful kids.

30:50.434 --> 30:51.727
...a fine thing of her to do.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.729
And it's nice to have you here, Jeff.
Wish you a lot of luck.

30:53.812 --> 30:57.024
Eight, seven, six.

30:57.107 --> 31:00.652
Main engine start. Two, one--

31:15.042 --> 31:16.168
So long, Trace.

31:22.299 --> 31:23.634
See you soon.

31:44.196 --> 31:45.822
What you got there, Mr. Piscotty?

31:47.616 --> 31:49.409
Just a sandwich, sir.

31:50.827 --> 31:53.705
I hear it's your last day on the job.
Congratulations.

31:54.206 --> 31:55.415
Why don't you put that on.

31:59.962 --> 32:03.632
Due respect, sir,
I'm air force, sir, not navy.

32:07.177 --> 32:08.220
Put it on.

32:19.523 --> 32:21.775
Now pull it down lower.

32:24.736 --> 32:25.821
Lower.

32:39.334 --> 32:40.627
That's gonna work.

32:42.671 --> 32:45.257
First of next week,
I want you to check out a T-38,

32:45.883 --> 32:46.884
meet me in Palmdale.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.554
Palmdale... California?

32:52.306 --> 32:53.557
Congratulations.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.351
You just drew right seat
of Pathfinder's maiden flight.

32:59.229 --> 33:00.272
Roger that, sir.

33:01.148 --> 33:02.149
Thank you.

33:27.090 --> 33:29.218
T-minus two hours and counting.

33:33.972 --> 33:35.516
-Hi, Bob.
-Hi, Bob.

33:36.934 --> 33:39.853
Man, this place is gonna feel
so odd without you.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.315
I think I'm gonna leave this to Molly.

33:43.398 --> 33:46.151
Her short game sucks.
She could use the practice.

33:47.986 --> 33:49.238
I'm sure she'll love that.

33:51.657 --> 33:52.658
What's up?

33:58.121 --> 34:04.002
Ed, I want you to know that I appreciate
the assignment to Jamestown 91

34:04.086 --> 34:06.088
and that you came up with it so quickly.

34:06.171 --> 34:07.256
I really do.

34:08.632 --> 34:09.632
But...

34:11.592 --> 34:12.636
But what?

34:13.887 --> 34:14.972
It's not good enough.

34:18.266 --> 34:19.601
Not good enough?

34:19.685 --> 34:21.687
I'm sorry, but it's not.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.482
I want a command slot.

34:25.983 --> 34:28.652
Dani, you really have been out of the loop
for too long.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.821
You don't just waltz in and demand--

34:30.904 --> 34:33.072
You know the sacrifices I've made.

34:33.156 --> 34:34.658
How much time I've lost.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.619
I was the first African American
in space, Ed.

34:38.203 --> 34:40.746
And now here I am,
still riding in the back.

34:43.292 --> 34:44.293
Come on, Dani.

34:45.668 --> 34:47.170
You really gonna take it there?

34:47.254 --> 34:48.755
I've given it a lot of thought.

34:50.090 --> 34:54.094
I want to be the first African American
woman to command a mission.

34:54.511 --> 34:58.390
First woman Black commander
is now a thing?

34:58.473 --> 35:00.058
Seriously? We're gonna parse it that fine?

35:00.142 --> 35:02.144
You're damn right we are, Ed.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.771
If you don't give me a command spot,

35:04.855 --> 35:08.609
I will always be seen as that weak little
Black girl who fell apart on the moon.

35:08.692 --> 35:11.862
But if I were a white man,
they'd have forgiven me a long time ago.

35:11.945 --> 35:16.116
I understand it feels that way,
but it's just not true.

35:20.329 --> 35:24.291
Remember Mercury 4, when Gus Grissom
splashed and the hatch blew early?

35:24.374 --> 35:26.251
Press never let him forget about that.

35:26.335 --> 35:28.795
You know, that had nothing to do
with the color of his skin.

35:31.048 --> 35:33.967
Ed, how many astronauts do we have now?

35:36.553 --> 35:37.971
Two hundred and five.

35:39.306 --> 35:41.058
And how many of 'em are Black?

35:42.476 --> 35:43.602
Eleven.

35:43.685 --> 35:46.396
And how many of them
have commanded a mission?

35:49.816 --> 35:50.817
One.

35:51.777 --> 35:54.821
Look, I hope you're not saying--
I hope you're not trying to imply that--

35:54.905 --> 35:57.032
I'm not trying to imply anything.

35:57.115 --> 35:58.742
I'm saying it straight.

35:59.326 --> 36:01.787
This is not good enough.

36:01.870 --> 36:04.706
Look, Dani, you gotta understand.
These things, they take time.

36:04.790 --> 36:08.585
You know, first they gotta qualify,
then they gotta be trained,

36:08.669 --> 36:10.754
and then they gotta get
some missions under their belt.

36:10.838 --> 36:12.840
Believe me, if they were ready,
they'd be commanding.

36:12.923 --> 36:16.301
"If they were ready"?
You sound like an NFL owner.

36:16.385 --> 36:18.679
Look, we've dealt with this issue.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.181
No. We haven't.

36:25.477 --> 36:29.022
Ed, I came into this program
as the token Black girl.

36:30.023 --> 36:33.277
And I was grateful for the opportunity,
no matter what the reasons.

36:34.027 --> 36:36.280
But that was 13 years ago.

36:36.780 --> 36:37.865
This program,

36:38.532 --> 36:42.244
it has the power to change the way
people see the world.

36:43.078 --> 36:44.162
You know that.

36:45.831 --> 36:48.166
I can't believe you're bringing this to me
on my last day.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.085
That's exactly why I'm bringing it up.

36:50.919 --> 36:52.754
Because until Molly takes over on Monday,

36:52.838 --> 36:55.299
you are the only one
with the power to do something.

36:58.927 --> 37:00.220
I gotta get to a meeting.

37:12.524 --> 37:13.525
Sorry I'm late.

37:13.609 --> 37:14.610
Hey, hey.

37:15.068 --> 37:16.195
For you, Ed.

37:17.029 --> 37:20.991
In honor of your nine years of service
as head of the Astronaut Office.

37:24.286 --> 37:28.707
Am I supposed to make a wish?

37:29.041 --> 37:32.920
Hasn't it already been granted?
You're commanding Pathfinder.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.259
What'd you wish for?

37:39.343 --> 37:40.928
To get on with this meeting.

37:41.470 --> 37:42.679
Amen to that.

37:43.639 --> 37:46.892
Well, I have some exciting news.

37:48.352 --> 37:50.562
The Soviets have accepted
the president's offer

37:50.646 --> 37:54.149
to mount a joint mission
between our two space programs.

37:54.483 --> 37:56.276
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

37:57.152 --> 38:00.531
You said there was no chance
they would agree to this.

38:00.614 --> 38:03.992
Apparently Premier Andropov
is eager to demonstrate to the world

38:04.076 --> 38:08.330
that the Soviet Union has peaceful
intentions toward the United States.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.916
I've said it before.
This is complete bullshit.

38:11.250 --> 38:13.168
The Soviets are still flying Soyuz.

38:13.252 --> 38:15.963
Haven't even managed to get
their shuttle Buran off the ground.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.798
And the only reason
why they agreed to this

38:17.881 --> 38:20.592
is so they can get a closer look
at our current technology.

38:21.677 --> 38:23.053
We don't have to give it to them.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.265
We can show the Reds
only what they've already seen.

38:26.348 --> 38:27.349
Meaning?

38:27.432 --> 38:30.394
We have an old Apollo command module
in storage here at JSC.

38:30.477 --> 38:33.939
It was a backup rescue ship for Skylab
before shuttles took over that job.

38:34.022 --> 38:36.483
And we were gonna send it
to the Smithsonian.

38:36.567 --> 38:38.360
If we use an Apollo for this,

38:38.819 --> 38:41.488
the Russians won't get anywhere near
our shuttle systems.

38:42.447 --> 38:45.242
As long as we have
a Saturn 1B lying around as well.

38:46.034 --> 38:47.202
Huntsville's got one.

38:50.706 --> 38:51.790
Well, then it's doable.

38:52.332 --> 38:53.959
The president is gonna love this.

38:54.042 --> 38:57.462
He still talks about how heroic-looking
the old Apollos were.

38:58.088 --> 39:00.883
Right, well, the Soviets say
they're already picking a crew, so--

39:00.966 --> 39:03.260
To demonstrate
that they're fully committed.

39:03.343 --> 39:04.928
So we need to do the same.

39:06.346 --> 39:08.849
I hate to put pressure on you
on your last day, Ed,

39:08.932 --> 39:12.186
but I'm not sure I want to leave this
to Ms. Cobb.

39:12.644 --> 39:15.647
At least you'll only have to pick two now
after the modifications.

39:17.858 --> 39:19.610
I can give you the commander right now.

39:20.944 --> 39:23.614
I hope you're not
appointing yourself to this one too.

39:23.697 --> 39:26.450
Nope. I'm assigning Danielle Poole.

39:27.701 --> 39:31.038
She has extensive Apollo experience,
and she'll be perfect for this.

39:33.165 --> 39:35.417
We might want to consider
other possibilities.

39:37.044 --> 39:38.045
Why is that?

39:39.379 --> 39:42.299
Ed, this mission
is very important to the president.

39:42.382 --> 39:44.676
He wants
only the best of the best to fly it.

39:45.469 --> 39:47.721
I spent three months on the moon with her.

39:47.804 --> 39:50.724
She performed brilliantly
under very stressful circumstances.

39:50.807 --> 39:54.478
I appreciate your loyalty,
but you know that's not true.

40:00.776 --> 40:02.361
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

40:03.612 --> 40:06.949
Come on, Ed.
Do I really need to spell it out?

40:08.033 --> 40:10.077
-The whole thing with her arm--
-That wasn't her fault.

40:11.161 --> 40:14.748
-Well, the public thinks--
-So we change public opinion.

40:14.831 --> 40:17.960
Tom, I trained with Poole.
And I agree with Ed.

40:18.544 --> 40:19.586
So do I.

40:20.254 --> 40:23.882
She did an exceptional job for us
during the Apollo 24 crisis.

40:25.259 --> 40:26.969
And I think it's time

40:27.052 --> 40:29.847
for an African American woman
to command a spaceflight.

40:30.514 --> 40:31.849
There's no argument there.

40:31.932 --> 40:34.977
Hell, I'm the one that selected Poole
as an astronaut to begin with.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.436
So what's the problem?

40:37.479 --> 40:39.523
I'm gonna get a lot of blowback
from the White House.

40:41.024 --> 40:44.862
You need to remind them of the plaque
that we were gonna bring up on Apollo 11.

40:44.945 --> 40:47.865
"We came in peace for all mankind."

40:47.948 --> 40:49.658
Now we need to live up to that.

40:49.741 --> 40:52.494
And this mission,
with all its symbolic value,

40:52.578 --> 40:54.496
is the perfect opportunity to do so.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.206
I think Ed's right on this one.

40:56.999 --> 40:59.835
Now look, the Soviets
love to grab any opportunity

40:59.918 --> 41:02.588
to highlight our troubled history
with race relations.

41:02.671 --> 41:06.758
This will send a powerful message
about the progress that we've made.

41:09.803 --> 41:12.639
All right, I'll run it up the flagpole.

41:12.723 --> 41:14.766
Let me know if anyone
gives you any trouble on that.

41:14.850 --> 41:17.936
I'll call the secretary of defense,
and he'll support this.

41:19.271 --> 41:20.689
I got your back on this, Tom.

41:47.007 --> 41:50.761
T-minus five, four, three, two--

41:53.305 --> 41:54.473
Can I have a minute?

41:55.974 --> 41:57.476
You got one fucking minute.

42:00.229 --> 42:02.064
-What's going on?
-What are you talking about?

42:02.147 --> 42:05.108
I thought we were friends.
You blindsided me back there.

42:05.192 --> 42:07.736
Wasn't premeditated, Tom.
Just happened in the moment.

42:07.819 --> 42:10.989
Yeah, I guess a lot of things
happen for you in the moment lately.

42:11.073 --> 42:13.450
You never discussed Pathfinder
with me either.

42:13.534 --> 42:16.703
And then, bang, Gordo Stevens
is suddenly off to the moon

42:16.787 --> 42:18.747
after being ground bound
for nearly a decade.

42:18.830 --> 42:21.124
Gordo's on salary.
He's one of the best pilots we got.

42:21.208 --> 42:24.294
Everyone knows he's a dr--
He's got a drinking problem.

42:25.462 --> 42:28.841
Have you taken a good look at him lately?
The man's a train wreck waiting to happen.

42:28.924 --> 42:30.968
Look, he's a little bit
on the chunky side right now,

42:31.051 --> 42:32.594
but he'll whip himself into shape.

42:32.678 --> 42:34.888
He always does. He aced his proficiency--

42:34.972 --> 42:38.100
I just hope you're making all
these decisions for the right reasons, Ed.

42:38.559 --> 42:41.353
Not out of nepotism or favoritism--

42:41.436 --> 42:43.522
Whatever kind of ism this is.

45:00.993 --> 45:02.119
Goddamn it!

45:03.787 --> 45:04.788
Shit.

45:15.048 --> 45:16.675
Ed did say noon, right?

45:16.758 --> 45:17.759
That's affirm.

45:19.678 --> 45:22.222
What's with the hat? You're air force.

45:23.599 --> 45:26.310
I... lost a bet.

45:27.352 --> 45:29.354
No shit. What was it?

45:32.107 --> 45:34.193
I was so drunk I...

45:35.068 --> 45:36.153
don't remember it.

45:37.362 --> 45:41.074
And NASA chose you to fly right seat
in its first nuclear spacecraft.

45:46.496 --> 45:47.664
Sorry I'm late.

45:47.748 --> 45:50.042
My Vette blew a rod
on my way out to Ellington.

45:50.125 --> 45:52.503
How old's that car anyway? What, 40 years?

45:52.586 --> 45:55.255
I got it 14 years ago, while you were
still playing tennis in high school.

45:55.339 --> 45:57.341
I'm just glad they don't make 'em
like they used to.

45:57.925 --> 46:00.552
Let's get this moving.
Gotta get back to Houston.

46:00.636 --> 46:04.139
I want you two to supervise
the sim mods while I fly out to the Cape

46:04.223 --> 46:06.725
to check out
the launch control center upgrades.

46:06.808 --> 46:08.310
Something I wanna show you first.

46:15.609 --> 46:18.695
-I appreciate you doing this for me, Troy.
-My pleasure, Ms. Poole.

46:19.696 --> 46:22.199
Not much in here but crates and mothballs.

46:23.283 --> 46:24.952
What are you looking for anyway?

46:25.577 --> 46:27.079
I wanna say hello to my ship.

46:40.759 --> 46:41.844
That's your ship?

46:43.804 --> 46:44.888
That tin can?

46:50.227 --> 46:51.436
That tin can.

46:55.983 --> 46:57.401
I give you Pathfinder.

47:04.074 --> 47:06.076
First time I've seen her ready to go.

47:06.577 --> 47:09.246
She's three times as powerful
as our current shuttles.

47:09.705 --> 47:11.540
And when we go to Mars,

47:11.623 --> 47:14.835
these nuclear engines
will cut 100 days off of our trip.

47:15.460 --> 47:19.339
Our job will be to test her
in the harshest environment we know.

47:20.549 --> 47:22.801
Shake every bug out of her system.

47:28.348 --> 47:32.269
Now, I chose you as my crew
because you're the best.

47:32.895 --> 47:34.897
Dr. Ride's been working on these engines
for years,

47:34.980 --> 47:37.649
and it's time you rode them into space.

47:38.275 --> 47:41.486
Unlike you, Captain Piscotty here
has never been on orbit,

47:41.570 --> 47:45.240
but I've seen him ace
six backup crew assignments.

47:46.158 --> 47:49.828
He seems to have a sixth sense
of what can go wrong and how to fix it.

47:50.954 --> 47:52.539
He's also a pretty fair pilot.

47:53.248 --> 47:54.750
Even though he does have red hair.

47:58.504 --> 48:01.924
Now, there'll be a lot of eyes on us.

48:03.550 --> 48:05.928
So we can afford no fuckups.

48:06.929 --> 48:08.931
That's why we will train our asses off.

48:10.098 --> 48:11.099
Roger that, skipper.

48:11.183 --> 48:12.601
Wouldn't have it any other way.

48:19.983 --> 48:21.193
Let's go make history.

48:30.202 --> 48:33.330
-...requests that you all rise...
-Oh, no.

48:33.413 --> 48:35.290
...and show respect

48:35.374 --> 48:39.545
while he sings
his nation's national anthem.

48:39.628 --> 48:41.713
Kick your ass, you commie bastard.

48:44.299 --> 48:46.844
Go on, keep singing
while you still got some teeth.

48:48.762 --> 48:50.389
Give me a break, Steve.

48:50.472 --> 48:52.015
Give me an umbrella. Hold it!

48:52.099 --> 48:53.851
-There it goes!
-Where is he?

48:56.937 --> 48:58.355
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:59.022 --> 49:00.858
from South Carolina...

49:02.734 --> 49:05.487
Sergeant Slaughter!

49:05.571 --> 49:06.613
Yeah!

49:10.284 --> 49:12.995
Slaughter's gonna kick his ass
all the way back to Siberia.

49:13.078 --> 49:14.913
Better watch Volkoff's right hand then.

49:15.956 --> 49:16.957
Last week in Shreveport,

49:17.040 --> 49:18.750
Volkoff whipped out
a foreign object from his trunks

49:18.834 --> 49:20.627
and then coldcocked Tito Santana.

49:20.961 --> 49:23.255
-You like wrestling?
-It's hilarious. Yeah.

49:23.839 --> 49:25.424
He's gonna kick your ass.

49:32.264 --> 49:34.349
Hey, Gordo, aren't you
supposed to be meeting Ed at Ellington?

49:34.433 --> 49:36.560
I thought you two were flying
down to the Cape together.

49:36.894 --> 49:39.479
Can't miss this. I'll drive fast.

49:39.563 --> 49:41.023
That's it.

49:41.106 --> 49:42.608
Pathfinder was amazing,

49:43.192 --> 49:46.236
but I about died when Sally
ribbed the admiral about his car.

49:46.737 --> 49:49.031
My mouth was so dry,
I couldn't say a word.

49:49.114 --> 49:50.908
Listen, zoomie.

49:51.909 --> 49:54.661
Ed Baldwin can trip over his dick
like anybody else.

49:55.245 --> 49:56.663
You're flying his right seat,

49:56.747 --> 49:59.750
so it is your job to call him out
when he fucks up.

50:00.542 --> 50:03.545
-If you can't do that, then--
-Jesus, Helena. Talk about a buzzkill.

50:04.087 --> 50:05.297
Watch out! Slingshot!

50:05.714 --> 50:06.715
Hey, Ed.

50:07.341 --> 50:10.802
Boy, now that is 313 pounds at least!

50:12.095 --> 50:14.556
Just being catapulted through the air...

50:15.098 --> 50:16.475
What a right arm!

50:16.558 --> 50:18.310
Yeah, that's it, Sarge! Pulverize him!

50:18.393 --> 50:20.729
-My word! Five rights...
-Arrest his ass!

50:20.812 --> 50:22.397
...and now the big guy flung across,
Sarge right--

50:22.481 --> 50:24.399
Hammer him into the goddamn canvas!

50:24.483 --> 50:28.612
And that one really rocked the Russian.
Volkoff down on a knee.

50:30.989 --> 50:32.241
The table's turning.

50:40.874 --> 50:43.961
Hey, ref, you blind?
That's illegal use of bicuspids!

50:46.129 --> 50:47.130
Dad?

50:49.299 --> 50:50.300
Dad?

50:56.181 --> 50:57.182
You okay, Dad?

50:59.142 --> 51:01.270
You can see those ants?

51:01.353 --> 51:03.021
Yeah, it's pretty hard to miss.

51:20.414 --> 51:21.915
You ready to go, buddy boy?

51:26.003 --> 51:27.004
What's wrong?

51:28.714 --> 51:29.882
I saw some ants.

51:32.843 --> 51:33.844
What?

51:34.428 --> 51:36.430
When? What were you doing?

51:36.513 --> 51:38.348
Was watching TV at the Outpost.

51:39.516 --> 51:41.894
And no booze, just Pepsi.

51:41.977 --> 51:44.396
They were just--
They were crawling everywhere, man.

51:45.606 --> 51:47.107
They were crawling everywhere.

51:48.066 --> 51:50.360
-Was anyone with you?
-Yeah, Danny was there.

51:50.444 --> 51:51.904
He was working.

51:53.197 --> 51:54.573
It was over pretty quick.

51:54.656 --> 51:58.202
Karen, she killed 'em with some bug spray.

52:00.329 --> 52:02.539
What-- Wait, you mean the ants were real?

52:02.623 --> 52:06.710
I thought I was losing it again, Ed.
Thought I was seeing things again.

52:06.793 --> 52:08.253
I couldn't catch my breath,

52:08.337 --> 52:11.381
and I was shaking and sweating
all the way here.

52:13.342 --> 52:17.095
I could just feel 'em
on my hands and on my face.

52:20.641 --> 52:22.392
What if it happens up there again, Ed?

52:22.476 --> 52:24.811
Gordo, you're not hallucinating.

52:25.687 --> 52:26.897
This isn't happening.

52:30.609 --> 52:32.110
You know, my old man...

52:33.695 --> 52:36.240
he was the toughest son of a bitch
I ever saw.

52:37.824 --> 52:40.410
And the horrors he endured in that war.

52:40.953 --> 52:44.164
Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Okinawa.

52:46.124 --> 52:47.626
And those banzai charges.

52:48.919 --> 52:52.422
Japs coming at him,
screaming like wild animals,

52:52.506 --> 52:54.424
running right over
the backs of their dead,

52:54.508 --> 52:56.510
but he never left his machine gun.

52:57.177 --> 52:58.846
He just kept right on firing.

52:59.638 --> 53:01.723
I never saw him back down from anything.

53:07.020 --> 53:08.105
Till the cancer.

53:17.489 --> 53:21.076
I'd go and see him.
He's laying flat on his back in his bed.

53:21.159 --> 53:23.245
He's gasping like a fish out of water.

53:25.038 --> 53:28.166
Eyes big and wide, and he's so scared.

53:36.258 --> 53:37.593
I just couldn't take it.

53:38.635 --> 53:40.137
Just ran out of the room.

53:48.520 --> 53:49.605
I don't know.

53:51.231 --> 53:52.316
Maybe the...

53:54.484 --> 53:56.361
fear was in him all along.

53:58.572 --> 53:59.573
Deep down.

54:02.117 --> 54:03.660
He was just too weak to...

54:08.457 --> 54:10.167
to fight against it anymore.

54:13.545 --> 54:14.755
What am I gonna do, Ed?

54:14.838 --> 54:16.381
You can start acting like a man.

54:19.384 --> 54:20.886
-What?
-You heard me.

54:23.180 --> 54:24.681
You're a goddamn astronaut.

54:25.849 --> 54:30.020
You sat your ass on top of five and a half
million pounds of high explosive fuel

54:30.103 --> 54:31.813
and told them, "Light the fuse."

54:31.897 --> 54:34.900
And now you're sitting there
crying like a little fucking baby!

54:34.983 --> 54:38.654
"Ed, I'm so scared. I'm so weak."

54:38.737 --> 54:40.906
How about you grow a pair,
for Christ's sakes!

54:43.575 --> 54:45.077
Careful, Ed.

54:45.160 --> 54:47.454
Or what? El Gordo's gonna do something?

54:47.538 --> 54:48.872
El Gordo just might.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.125
-Maybe you have lost it.
-Shut up.

54:52.209 --> 54:54.211
-Maybe you're not Gordo Stevens anymore!
-Shut up!

54:57.673 --> 55:00.008
Why don't you book a flight to Florida
on Pan Am?

55:00.092 --> 55:01.760
I'm sure they can find you a seat.

55:22.573 --> 55:24.867
Niner-five-niner, niner-one-zero.

55:26.076 --> 55:30.080
Ed, we're beaucoup south of our route.
Fuel's gonna be a major problem.

55:30.873 --> 55:31.915
What's the deal?

55:31.999 --> 55:35.335
Just a little detour. Thought we'd see
if you got any stones left.

55:39.590 --> 55:42.009
You're flying in dogfight territory, son.

55:44.011 --> 55:46.889
You bastard.
Okay, I'm gonna kick your ass.

55:47.681 --> 55:48.891
Fight's on, buddy.

55:54.938 --> 55:58.609
In the wake of Cold War tensions
that show no signs of easing,

55:58.692 --> 56:02.863
at least one person is calling
for everyone to just come together.

56:02.946 --> 56:04.656
His name, John Lennon.

56:04.740 --> 56:06.575
The famed musician and activist

56:06.658 --> 56:09.286
is reaching out
to world leaders and fans alike,

56:09.369 --> 56:12.372
promoting what he calls
a concert for peace.

56:12.456 --> 56:15.125
Hosted by Lennon, the concert
would take place in New York City

56:15.209 --> 56:16.585
sometime in the fall.

56:16.668 --> 56:20.005
No word yet from Paul, George or Ringo
as to whether they'll be joining.

56:21.173 --> 56:22.174
In other news,

56:22.257 --> 56:25.052
an absolutely stunning development
in Panama today.

56:25.594 --> 56:28.263
According to the Pentagon,
a team of Navy SEALs

56:28.347 --> 56:30.974
penetrated
the Panamanian military installation

56:31.058 --> 56:34.811
where the American soldiers were held
and rescued all four of the men.

56:34.895 --> 56:35.896
No shit.

56:35.979 --> 56:39.233
At least two Panamanian soldiers
were killed in the exchange of gunfire.

56:39.733 --> 56:41.610
President Torrijos denounced the action

56:41.693 --> 56:45.155
as an outrageous violation
of Panamanian sovereignty

56:45.239 --> 56:47.658
and has called upon the Soviet Union

56:47.741 --> 56:49.493
to help his country defend itself...

57:03.465 --> 57:05.259
-Shit.
-It's okay.

57:15.561 --> 57:17.062
I won't tell anyone if you won't.

57:28.407 --> 57:32.703
Yeah, I don't want you doing this
with Kelly though. Ever, all right?

57:33.704 --> 57:34.830
Aye, aye, ma'am.

57:50.137 --> 57:53.348
Slippery little bastard.
Ain't gonna save you though.

57:54.224 --> 57:55.601
Check this out, cheesedick.

58:00.731 --> 58:01.857
Oh, no, you don't.

58:05.777 --> 58:08.947
And... there you are.

58:10.532 --> 58:12.534
Sorry, sailor. Saw that coming.

58:17.289 --> 58:18.457
Time to eat your lunch.

58:19.208 --> 58:20.459
Pipper's on.

58:20.918 --> 58:24.421
Fox Two! That's all she wrote, buddy.

58:26.423 --> 58:27.591
Geez.

58:29.051 --> 58:31.220
We call that a clean kill.

58:31.303 --> 58:35.224
We call that dumb luck, Gordo.
Let's make it two out of three.

58:37.059 --> 58:39.770
That's not good. Warning tone.

58:39.853 --> 58:42.940
Jesus, Ed, you're on fire.
You got flames under your left engine.

58:43.774 --> 58:45.108
Shit!

58:46.944 --> 58:48.695
You better get out and walk, buddy.

58:48.779 --> 58:50.405
More like go for a swim.

58:50.489 --> 58:53.075
I'll call SAR. Ed, get out of there now!

58:53.158 --> 58:56.453
Mayday, Mayday. Houston Center.
NASA niner-one-zero over the Gulf.

58:56.912 --> 58:59.706
NASA niner-five-niner
is on fire and ejecting now.
