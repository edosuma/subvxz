Hi.
Good morning.

00:20.088 --> 00:23.491
[Sighs]
I got it: "Catch the Comet."

00:23.524 --> 00:25.126
Oh.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.661
No. [Laughs]
Why not?

00:27.695 --> 00:30.298
Because it sounds
like the flu.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.732

Or the clap.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.335
How 'bout: "Let's Comet"?

How 'bout, let's not.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.608

00:40.641 --> 00:42.676
Yes, and I would love
to be your focus group.

That's a little evil.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.421
It's a joke.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.356

to visit him soon, okay?

00:57.691 --> 00:59.227
[Microwave beeping]
Mm-hmm.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.462
He knows I told you,
and he feels bad...

01:01.495 --> 01:02.763
I think
he wants to apologize.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.133
There's no need.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.494
Donna:
Thanks for coming in.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.830
I thought it was important
that we speak face to face --

01:36.864 --> 01:39.500
and in private.

01:39.533 --> 01:43.671
I wrote ninety percent
of the code Rover's built on.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.674
Yes, back when it was
a medical indexing company.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.542
But Rover's evolved,

01:48.576 --> 01:50.378
and you haven't evolved
with it.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.280
I've done everything
you've asked me to do.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.581
Why am I
the one that has to go?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.583
Bos has already stepped away.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.918
And frankly,
your deal is much more --

01:57.951 --> 02:00.221
I made this company
with my friends.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.324
Do you think I give a shit
about an exit package?!

02:03.357 --> 02:05.393
We were fine
until you came in

02:05.426 --> 02:07.728
and started demanding
the impossible.

02:07.761 --> 02:12.166
If I've been hard on you,
I'm sorry.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.534

02:13.567 --> 02:15.803

about what's fair.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.938
This is about survival.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.807
I don't think
you care about the money.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.676
But I do think you care
about your friends.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.420
[Sighs]

02:32.453 --> 02:35.756
The fact is, by passing someone
else's work off as your own,

02:35.789 --> 02:39.960
you've put them
in a precarious position.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.830
The only way to protect them

02:42.863 --> 02:45.499
is to take
the search algorithm apart

02:45.533 --> 02:49.403
and build Rover's own
proprietary version of it.

02:49.437 --> 02:53.507
And for that to work,
you can't be involved.

02:56.544 --> 03:01.849
I do know what it's like,
to feel like a failure.

03:01.882 --> 03:06.454
To feel like
you don't measure up.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.656
But if you don't step aside

03:08.689 --> 03:10.258
and let me bring in
someone else,

03:10.291 --> 03:13.827
you and your friends
could end up with nothing.

03:16.497 --> 03:21.302
[Breathes deeply]

03:21.335 --> 03:23.337
So what do I tell them?

we can invite your friends.

of Rover.

bringing me a beer?

You can have one too,

I saw him Friday,

11:39.833 --> 11:41.902
your dad and I used to go
camping all the time,

11:41.935 --> 11:44.071
and we went
to this one campsite.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.007

about this quarry they'd go to.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.776
It was a swimming hole.

there, and we found it.

He wouldn't.
It was too high.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.925

12:04.958 --> 12:06.827
and he said,
"I bet you won't, either."

12:06.860 --> 12:09.362
So before I could think twice,
I ran right up to the edge,

12:09.396 --> 12:11.531

20:42.074 --> 20:45.345
of a universal,
decentralized platform

20:45.378 --> 20:47.447
that's already
changing the world.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.282
Look.
You could join Microsoft

20:49.316 --> 20:52.385
and let them tell you
what the future will be.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.622
Or you could join us
and tell them.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.763
I accepted the Microsoft offer
this morning.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.399
I only kept this meeting
because, well, growing up,

21:06.433 --> 21:08.067
I was a huge fan
of Mutiny --

21:08.100 --> 21:09.336
really Community.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.304
I-I made friends,

21:11.338 --> 21:12.805
and I traded bootlegs

21:12.839 --> 21:15.508
and bought
and sold computer parts.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.810
It was a lifesaver, really.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.412
And I, uh...

21:19.446 --> 21:21.948
**

21:21.981 --> 21:25.084
Well, I guess
I just wanted to thank you.

21:25.117 --> 21:29.722
That's really nice to hear,
but I [Sighs]

21:29.756 --> 21:31.591
I was really hoping
this would work out.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.461
[Sighs]

21:34.494 --> 21:35.962
Can I ask you a question?

21:35.995 --> 21:38.565
**

21:38.598 --> 21:42.935
Community was so far ahead
of its time.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.605
Why haven't you tried
to re-create it?

21:45.638 --> 21:50.109
**

21:50.142 --> 21:52.945
Mutiny was
the most fun I ever had.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.881
We didn't know
what we were doing.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.649
It was one crisis
after another.

21:56.683 --> 22:00.553
Hm.
But it worked.

22:00.587 --> 22:05.525
The failure of that was...

22:05.558 --> 22:07.960
Well, what's that saying --

22:07.994 --> 22:11.030
You grow stronger
at the broken places...?

22:11.063 --> 22:14.100
Hm.
Anyway.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.802
Yeah, the truth is,

22:15.835 --> 22:19.806
I am trying to build
another version of Community.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.941
Except, this time,
it's the entire Internet.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.577
It's everyone.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.446
That's what's so exciting
about Rover.

22:26.479 --> 22:31.818
It's flying without a net
into the great unknown.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.786
Huh.
It's terrifying,

22:33.820 --> 22:36.789
and it's exhilarating.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.691
[Sighs]

22:38.725 --> 22:40.026
Well...

22:40.059 --> 22:43.796
I have been known
to change my mind, though.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.165
Yeah.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.600
Microsoft's safe.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.769
But, um,
well, what's that saying?

22:49.802 --> 22:52.605
No risk, no reward, right?

22:52.639 --> 22:53.840
I'm in.

If you still want me,
that is.

it was so hard.

I had no say
in your care

had gone wrong...

it was worth a second look.

what a fool I was --

would be a win-win,

a wall, and I panicked.

I'll talk to my teacher.
I can...

that you could work here

27:42.194 --> 27:44.330
That was the deal.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.933
S-So what're you saying?
I have to stop working?

27:46.966 --> 27:49.168
Just temporarily until you can
bring your grades back up,

27:49.201 --> 27:50.469

I even need school?

27:59.178 --> 28:00.379
I already have a job.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.481
Because you need school
to learn

28:02.514 --> 28:04.917

My friends are here --

29:11.350 --> 29:13.252

29:13.285 --> 29:16.889

he's made some bad decisions

29:16.923 --> 29:18.124
regarding Rover.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.827
But I think
you already know that.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.495
Well, I [Sighs]

29:23.529 --> 29:25.131
I had my suspicions,

but I didn't know for sure
until I saw Cam...

29:28.600 --> 29:30.502
It's done.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.938
Now, the important thing

29:31.971 --> 29:34.173
is to clean up the mess
and move on.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.176
I couldn't agree more.
Cecil is gone.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.444
We plan to find someone

29:38.477 --> 29:39.912
who can reverse engineer
Rover's code --

29:39.946 --> 29:41.247
Reverse engineer?
Why?

29:41.280 --> 29:43.282
Oh, to protect the site
from any liabilities --

29:43.315 --> 29:45.551
But if Cameron
built this code,

29:45.584 --> 29:47.253
the next step --
the only step --

29:47.286 --> 29:48.855
is to get her
to sign a release.

29:48.888 --> 29:49.989
That's how we protect
the site.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.391
Yes, yes.
[Sighs]

29:52.424 --> 29:54.393
But in this one case,

29:54.426 --> 29:57.329
I really think
that is the wrong move.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.231
I mean, why let Cameron know

29:59.265 --> 30:01.200
how valuable
what she gave us was?

30:01.233 --> 30:03.035
I mean, better
to just create our own version

30:03.069 --> 30:05.037
of the algorithm,
and no one will be any wiser.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.039
That doesn't make any sense.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.274
Look, there is
one simple solution,

30:08.307 --> 30:09.909
and it should've happened
immediately:

30:09.942 --> 30:11.610
pay Cameron whatever she wants
and be done with it.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.913
No!
I can't. I can't.

30:13.946 --> 30:16.082

I-I can't.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.298
Well, this is
what's gonna happen.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.866
You're going
to go to Cameron

30:33.900 --> 30:35.434
and get her
to sign a release.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.603
And then
you will step away.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.939
And Trip will take over.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.875
Th-- I...

30:42.909 --> 30:44.643
That's not fair.

He'll -- You know him.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.314

To become managing partner?

30:48.347 --> 30:49.348
Perhaps.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.017
Maybe that's best.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.485
Frankly, you have
bigger issues to deal with.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.887
Get yourself together,
Donna.

I'm tired
of holding your hand.

would've happened

just come and talk to you.

to give up on you.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.950
Yeah. Um...

31:23.983 --> 31:26.452
So what is this about,
exactly?

31:26.485 --> 31:27.954
You, um...

31:27.987 --> 31:29.922

Oh, no.

a passive receptacle, but --
