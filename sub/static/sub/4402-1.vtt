04:28.076 --> 04:30.476
- Here we go, Nick.
- All right.

04:33.376 --> 04:35.346
- Good morning, Detective.
- I want a shot of the two detectives.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.436
Keep it back, folks.

04:37.516 --> 04:39.446
- Howdy.
- Morning.

04:41.956 --> 04:44.016
Up there.

04:48.196 --> 04:50.456
- How's it going, Gus?
- Morning, Pete.

04:50.526 --> 04:54.926
- Who was this fucking guy?
- Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

04:54.996 --> 04:57.126
- Never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.536
- Hey, Ronny, where they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.

04:59.666 --> 05:03.166
Mid '60s, had five or six hits. 
Got a club down on Fillmore now.

05:03.376 --> 05:04.896
Not now, he don't.

05:06.376 --> 05:08.506
- Do we have a time of death? 
- Almost. 

05:08.676 --> 05:11.046
- Do you guys know Captain Tallcott?
- Sure.

05:11.086 --> 05:14.376
- What's the Chief's office doing here?
- Observing.

05:16.416 --> 05:20.376
- What's it say, Doc?
- Ninety-two degrees. About six hours.

05:20.456 --> 05:23.016
Puts time of death at around 2:00 a.m.

05:23.096 --> 05:26.426
Can somebody close the drapes over there?

05:26.496 --> 05:29.126
Maid came in about an hour ago 
and found the body.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.536
- She's not a live-in.
- Maybe the maid did it.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.136
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.

05:34.176 --> 05:36.666
- No bruises on the body.
- It ain't the maid.

05:36.906 --> 05:38.136
Never know.

05:42.016 --> 05:43.416
Sorry.

05:43.446 --> 05:47.006
He was last seen leaving the club 
with his girlfriend about midnight.

05:47.086 --> 05:50.916
- What was it?
- Ice pick. Left it in the living room.

05:53.226 --> 05:56.456
There's come stains all over the sheets.

06:04.036 --> 06:07.496
- Very impressive.
- He got off before he got off.

06:07.706 --> 06:09.636
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.

06:09.676 --> 06:12.406
Mr. Boz was a major contributor 
to the mayor's campaign.

06:12.476 --> 06:14.966
He was chairman of the board 
of the Palace of Fine Arts.

06:15.046 --> 06:17.016
I thought he was a rock and roll star.

06:17.046 --> 06:19.106
He was a retired rock and roll star.

06:19.186 --> 06:22.446
A civic-minded, 
very respectable rock and roll star.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.046
Then, what's that over there?

06:27.186 --> 06:30.456
Looks like civic-minded, 
very respectable cocaine.

06:32.966 --> 06:35.896
Listen to me, Curran. 
I'm gonna get a lot of heat on this.

06:35.936 --> 06:37.896
I don't want any mistakes.

06:43.476 --> 06:45.306
What's Boz's girl friend's name?

06:46.976 --> 06:50.466
"Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero."

06:57.216 --> 07:00.186
- Always a pleasure, Captain.
- He's up bright and early.

07:00.256 --> 07:03.316
He doesn't usually punch in 
'til after his 18 holes.

07:03.526 --> 07:05.896
Johnny and the mayor 
must have been very tight.

07:05.966 --> 07:08.336
Nick, keep your 3:00.

07:08.336 --> 07:10.196
You want me to work the case...

07:10.236 --> 07:12.026
- I said, keep it!
- All right.

07:12.106 --> 07:13.896
I'll keep it.

07:47.236 --> 07:49.296
Good morning. I'm Detective Curran. 
This is Detective Moran.

07:49.336 --> 07:54.006
San Francisco Police Department. 
I'd like to speak to Catherine Tramell.

07:55.376 --> 07:57.276
Come in.

08:02.956 --> 08:05.356
Sit, please. Just a moment.

08:11.926 --> 08:14.956
Ain't that cute? 
They got his and hers Picasso's.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.326
- I didn't know you knew a Picasso.
- Sure I do. It says right here.

08:18.366 --> 08:20.356
Hers is bigger.

08:31.186 --> 08:34.246
Sorry to bother you. 
We just got a couple of questions.

08:34.285 --> 08:37.046
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.

08:37.086 --> 08:38.885
What do you want?

08:38.956 --> 08:41.426
When was the last time you saw John Boz?

08:42.996 --> 08:44.256
Is he dead?

08:45.396 --> 08:47.366
Why do you think he's dead?

08:47.396 --> 08:50.096
Well, you wouldn't be here otherwise, 
would you?

08:50.166 --> 08:52.326
Were you with him last night?

08:54.236 --> 08:56.936
You're looking for Catherine, not me.

08:59.046 --> 09:01.206
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxy.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.276
I'm her friend.

09:09.186 --> 09:12.086
Well, Roxy, 
do you know where your friend is?

09:13.686 --> 09:18.386
She's out at the beach house at Stenson. 
Seadrift 1402.

09:18.696 --> 09:19.956
Thanks.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.966
You're wasting your time.

09:26.906 --> 09:29.966
Catherine didn't kill him.

10:45.016 --> 10:46.206
Miss Tramell?

11:04.366 --> 11:07.136
Good afternoon. I'm Detective Curran. 
This is Detective Moran.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.366
- We're with the San Francisco Police...
- I know who you are.

11:12.076 --> 11:13.436
So, how did he die?

11:13.906 --> 11:15.006
He was murdered.

11:15.046 --> 11:16.446
Obviously.

11:16.916 --> 11:20.076
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.

11:24.456 --> 11:26.426
How long were you dating him?

11:27.956 --> 11:30.446
I wasn't dating him. 
I was fucking him.

11:33.296 --> 11:34.356
What are you, a pro?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.226
No, I'm an amateur.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.496
How long were you having sex with him?

11:40.936 --> 11:42.406
About a year and a half.

11:42.476 --> 11:45.036
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.

11:45.076 --> 11:46.236
Did you leave the club with him?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.906
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?

11:48.976 --> 11:52.916
No. We had a drink at the club. 
We left together.

11:52.986 --> 11:54.916
He went home, and I came out here.

11:54.986 --> 11:57.116
Was there anyone with you last night?

11:57.156 --> 12:00.416
No. I wasn't in the mood last night.

12:08.496 --> 12:12.196
Let me ask you something, Miss Tramell.

12:12.236 --> 12:14.396
Are you sorry he's dead?

12:14.476 --> 12:16.436
Yeah.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.036
I liked fucking him.

12:24.346 --> 12:26.476
Look, I don't really feel like talking anymore.

12:28.016 --> 12:30.956
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown, 
if you want.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.046
So read me my rights and arrest me...

12:33.126 --> 12:35.286
and then I'll go downtown.

12:40.196 --> 12:43.096
Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.

12:50.206 --> 12:52.196
Please.

13:15.396 --> 13:17.626
Nice girl.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.686
I'm sorry, Beth. 
I got hung up in Stenson.

13:39.126 --> 13:42.386
- How are you, Nick?
- I'm fine.

13:42.456 --> 13:45.396
Come on, Beth. You know I'm fine.
How long do we have to keep doing this?

13:45.466 --> 13:48.456
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, 
I suppose.

13:48.496 --> 13:50.486
- Have a seat.
- It's bullshit. You know it is.

13:50.696 --> 13:55.656
I know it is. But sit down, anyway, 
so we can get it over with, okay?

14:03.116 --> 14:06.376
So, how are things?

14:06.416 --> 14:09.416
Things are fine.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.286
I told you, all right? 
Things are fine.

14:12.356 --> 14:14.256
How is your personal life?

14:14.286 --> 14:16.286
My sex life is fine.

14:18.366 --> 14:22.296
My sex life is actually pretty shitty 
since I stopped seeing you.

14:26.106 --> 14:28.166
I started developing calluses.

14:32.506 --> 14:35.176
Sorry.

14:36.246 --> 14:37.506
How's the booze?

14:37.676 --> 14:40.146
Haven't had a drink in three months.

14:40.186 --> 14:43.316
- What about the coke?
- No.

14:43.386 --> 14:47.486
No. I'm working my ass off. 
I'm off the sauce.

14:47.656 --> 14:49.646
I even stopped smoking.

14:51.126 --> 14:52.356
How is not smoking?

14:52.426 --> 14:54.416
It sucks.

14:56.336 --> 14:58.496
Now, will you tell I.A. 
I'm just your average...

14:58.706 --> 15:01.166
healthy, totally fucked up cop...

15:01.166 --> 15:04.196
and let me out of here, please?

15:10.446 --> 15:12.876
Yes.

15:12.916 --> 15:14.906
Thank you.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.686
I still miss you, Nick.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.436
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

15:38.206 --> 15:40.476
Tallcott's in there. They're waiting. 
How did it go?

15:40.646 --> 15:42.376
She misses me.

15:42.446 --> 15:45.416
Boy, when that girl mates, 
it's for life.

15:45.446 --> 15:47.676
All right, let's start. 
Harrigan.

15:47.916 --> 15:50.186
Well, we got 31 stab wounds, 
neck and the chest.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.916
No usable prints, no forceable entry, 
nothing missing.

15:52.956 --> 15:56.446
No prints on the ice pick, either. 
You can pick it up at any K-Mart.

15:56.526 --> 15:59.496
The scarf was Hermes. 
It's expensive.

15:59.666 --> 16:02.656
They sell about 20,000 a year, worldwide.

16:02.896 --> 16:06.696
Bottle was cocaine. High quality, high content. 
He inhaled it.

16:06.936 --> 16:09.926
There were minute quantities 
on his lips and penis.

16:10.006 --> 16:11.936
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million.

16:12.006 --> 16:14.976
No direct survivors. 
No criminal record.

16:15.216 --> 16:18.306
He liked his drugs. He liked his girls. 
He liked his rock and roll.

16:18.346 --> 16:20.006
He liked the mayor too, right?

16:25.486 --> 16:27.476
What about his girlfriend?

16:27.656 --> 16:30.686
- Is she relevant here? Is she a suspect?
- She's a suspect.

16:30.926 --> 16:32.296
On what basis?

16:32.326 --> 16:35.456
"Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell. Age 30. 
No priors. No convictions.

16:35.496 --> 16:38.026
Magna cum laude at Berkeley, 1983.

16:38.236 --> 16:40.706
Double major: Literature and psychology.

16:40.906 --> 16:43.336
Daughter, sole survivor, 
Marvin and Elaine Tramell...

16:43.376 --> 16:45.936
killed in a boating accident, 1979.

16:46.006 --> 16:50.346
Catherine Tramell, sole heir. 
Estimated assets: $110 million."

16:50.376 --> 16:52.386
You're shitting me.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.216
"Formerly engaged to Manuel Vasquez, deceased."

16:55.256 --> 16:57.876
Whoa, whoa! Manny Vasquez?

16:57.956 --> 17:01.326
Former middleweight contender. 
Killed in the ring, Atlantic City, 1984.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.626
I love it. She's got 100 million bucks.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.886
She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars...

17:05.965 --> 17:08.026
and she's got a degree 
in screwing with people's heads.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.066
You forgot about her degree in literature. 
She's a writer.

17:11.236 --> 17:15.266
She published a novel under a pen name. 
Want to know what it's about?

17:15.336 --> 17:20.276
It's about a retired rock and roll star 
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

17:32.956 --> 17:35.326
Page 67, cowboy.

17:35.396 --> 17:37.916
You know how she does the boyfriend?

17:37.956 --> 17:41.456
With an ice pick, in bed...

17:41.536 --> 17:45.056
his hands tied with a white silk scarf.

17:49.676 --> 17:51.506
Dr. Garner.

17:53.006 --> 17:56.876
I've asked Dr. Lamont to consult with us. 
This isn't really my turf.

17:56.946 --> 18:00.076
Dr. Lamont teaches the pathology 
of psychopathic behavior at Stanford...

18:00.246 --> 18:03.916
and also on the Justice Department 
Psychological Profile Team.

18:03.986 --> 18:05.956
Dr. Lamont.

18:07.656 --> 18:09.886
I see two possibilities.

18:09.956 --> 18:13.896
One: The person who wrote this book 
is your murderer...

18:13.966 --> 18:18.096
and acted out the killing described 
in ritualistic, literal detail.

18:18.306 --> 18:21.326
Two: Someone who wants to harm the writer...

18:21.406 --> 18:25.036
read the book and enacted the killing described 
to incriminate her.

18:25.106 --> 18:27.876
What if the writer did it? 
Then what are we dealing with?

18:27.946 --> 18:31.276
You're dealing with a devious, 
diabolical mind.

18:31.346 --> 18:34.946
You see, this book had to have been written 
at least six months...

18:35.016 --> 18:37.916
maybe even years... 
before it was published...

18:37.956 --> 18:41.486
which means the writer must have planned the crime 
in the subconscious back then.

18:41.556 --> 18:43.956
Now, the fact that she carried it out...

18:44.026 --> 18:46.086
indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior...

18:46.166 --> 18:48.166
in terms not only of the killing itself...

18:48.166 --> 18:52.036
but also in terms 
of the applied advance defense mechanism.

18:53.436 --> 18:57.066
Sometimes I can't tell shit from shinola, Doc.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.666
What was all that you just said?

18:58.876 --> 19:01.176
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.

19:01.376 --> 19:04.076
She's going to say, "Do you think 
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone...

19:04.116 --> 19:06.416
in the exact way I described in my book?"

19:06.446 --> 19:08.886
I wouldn't do that 
because I know I'd be the suspect.

19:08.916 --> 19:12.516
So, what if it's not the writer? 
What if it's someone who read the book?

19:14.156 --> 19:17.126
You're dealing, then, 
with someone so obsessed...

19:17.156 --> 19:21.426
that he or she is willing to kill 
an irrelevant and innocent victim...

19:21.496 --> 19:24.696
in order to place the blame 
on the person who wrote that book.

19:24.906 --> 19:28.466
I'm talking about 
a deep-seated obsessional hatred...

19:28.506 --> 19:31.436
and an utter lack of respect 
for human life.

19:37.876 --> 19:42.376
So, we got a once in a lifetime, 
top of the line looney-tuney.

19:42.416 --> 19:44.516
That's what you're saying, right, Doc?

19:46.086 --> 19:49.456
You're dealing with someone very dangerous...

19:49.526 --> 19:52.186
and very ill.

19:56.496 --> 20:00.226
You know there's no case here. 
You've got no physical evidence.

20:00.436 --> 20:03.026
She hasn't got an alibi.

20:03.106 --> 20:06.036
She hasn't got a motive, either. 
Believe me...

20:06.106 --> 20:09.046
her defense would just beat us to death 
with this copycat thing.

20:09.046 --> 20:12.416
Anybody who read the book could have done it.

20:12.446 --> 20:16.906
- What do you want to do now? Nothing?
- We call her in for questioning.

20:16.956 --> 20:18.946
She's got enough money 
to burn the department down...

20:18.986 --> 20:22.186
She was the last person seen with the guy.

20:22.226 --> 20:25.026
I'll take the responsibility.

20:25.096 --> 20:27.066
It's yours.

20:29.236 --> 20:30.896
It won't do any good.

20:30.966 --> 20:33.056
She'll just waltz 
in with some superstar lawyer...

20:33.136 --> 20:36.036
who'll get us all canned 
for wasting the taxpayers' money.

20:36.036 --> 20:38.476
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No, she won't.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.006
I don't think she'll hide behind anybody.

20:44.046 --> 20:46.136
I don't think she's gonna hide at all.

20:46.216 --> 20:49.146
Then she's as crazy as you are, Curran.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.146
You know what they say:

20:56.226 --> 20:58.956
Takes one to know one.

21:23.556 --> 21:27.286
Miss Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown 
to answer a few questions.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.456
Are you arresting me?

21:30.496 --> 21:32.516
If that's the way you want to play it.

21:32.596 --> 21:35.996
Could I change into something more appropriate?

21:36.066 --> 21:38.326
It'll only take a minute. 
Come on in.

21:42.236 --> 21:45.506
Make yourselves comfortable. 
I'll be right back.

22:03.026 --> 22:04.286
- Hey, Gus. 
- Hmm?

22:04.326 --> 22:08.286
- So, how long is this gonna take?
- I don't know.

22:13.266 --> 22:15.966
Do you always keep old newspapers around?

22:16.006 --> 22:18.976
Only when they make interesting reading.

22:34.126 --> 22:37.216
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.

22:37.296 --> 22:39.956
Why would I need an attorney?

22:50.176 --> 22:53.036
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

22:53.076 --> 22:55.046
Yes, you do.

22:57.116 --> 22:59.546
- I quit.
- Congratulations.

23:11.596 --> 23:13.926
I thought you didn't have any cigarettes.

23:13.996 --> 23:16.396
Oh, I found some in my pocket. 
Would you like one?

23:19.436 --> 23:21.926
I told you, I quit.

23:22.006 --> 23:24.166
It won't last.

23:29.116 --> 23:32.376
- You working on another book?
- Yes, I am.

23:32.416 --> 23:36.216
It must really be something 
making stuff up all the time.

23:36.256 --> 23:38.986
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.

23:40.326 --> 23:41.986
How's that?

23:43.026 --> 23:46.966
You make up believable stuff. 
It's called suspension of disbelief.

23:47.996 --> 23:50.326
I like that! 
Suspension of disbelief.

23:53.136 --> 23:55.126
What's your new book about?

23:58.036 --> 24:01.006
A detective. 
He falls for the wrong woman.

24:06.986 --> 24:08.206
What happens?

24:08.246 --> 24:10.376
She kills him.

24:22.366 --> 24:25.166
I'm John Carreli, Miss Tramell, 
assistant district attorney.

24:25.206 --> 24:27.226
I have to inform you 
this session's being taped.

24:27.306 --> 24:30.166
- This is Captain Tallcott.
- My pleasure.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.266
- And Lieutenant Walker.
- Hi.

24:32.346 --> 24:35.006
- Can we get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

24:35.076 --> 24:37.046
Are your attorneys going to join us?

24:37.076 --> 24:39.206
Miss Tramell has waived her rights 
to an attorney.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.256
Did I miss something?

24:45.326 --> 24:47.256
I told them you wouldn't want 
an attorney present.

24:48.286 --> 24:51.196
Why have you waived your right 
to an attorney, Miss Tramell?

24:51.226 --> 24:53.196
Why did you think I wouldn't want one?

24:53.226 --> 24:55.386
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.

24:55.436 --> 24:58.166
I have nothing to hide.

25:11.916 --> 25:14.276
There's no smoking in this building.

25:16.116 --> 25:18.386
What are you gonna do? 
Charge me with smoking?

25:32.066 --> 25:35.166
Would you tell us the nature 
of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

25:35.236 --> 25:38.176
I had sex with him 
for about a year and a half.

25:39.446 --> 25:42.436
I liked having sex with him.

25:42.476 --> 25:46.106
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.

25:46.186 --> 25:49.206
I like men like that.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.376
Men who give me pleasure.

25:52.486 --> 25:55.456
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

25:59.466 --> 26:05.126
You ever engage in any sadomasochistic activity?

26:06.966 --> 26:09.936
Exactly what did you have in mind, Mr. Carreli?

26:12.446 --> 26:14.376
- You ever tie him up?
- No.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.036
You never tied him up?

26:16.116 --> 26:18.076
No.

26:18.116 --> 26:21.016
Johnny liked to use his hands too much.

26:21.086 --> 26:24.056
I like hands and fingers.

26:25.256 --> 26:28.316
You describe a white silk scarf in your book.

26:28.356 --> 26:31.126
I've always had a fondness 
for white silk scarves.

26:31.196 --> 26:33.166
They're good for all occasions.

26:33.196 --> 26:36.966
But you said you liked men 
to use their hands, didn't you?

26:36.996 --> 26:39.366
No, I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.

26:41.466 --> 26:45.426
I don't make any rules, Nick. 
I go with the flow.

26:47.476 --> 26:49.406
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Miss Tramell?

26:49.476 --> 26:52.446
I'd have to be pretty stupid 
to write a book about killing...

26:52.516 --> 26:55.486
and then kill somebody 
the way I described it in my book.

26:55.516 --> 26:59.416
I'd be announcing myself as the killer. 
I'm not stupid.

26:59.456 --> 27:01.386
We know you're not stupid.

27:01.426 --> 27:03.356
Maybe that's what you're counting on 
to get you off the hook.

27:03.396 --> 27:05.186
Writing the book gives you an alibi.

27:05.266 --> 27:06.986
Yes, it does.

27:10.136 --> 27:13.366
The answer's no. I didn't kill him.

27:15.976 --> 27:19.206
- Do you use drugs, Miss Tramell?
- Sometimes.

27:19.276 --> 27:22.206
- Did you ever use drugs with Mr. Boz?
- Sure.

27:22.276 --> 27:23.406
What kind of drugs?

27:23.446 --> 27:25.636
Cocaine.

27:26.016 --> 27:27.986
Have you ever fucked on cocaine, Nick?

27:43.096 --> 27:45.036
It's nice.

27:55.416 --> 27:57.406
You like playing games, don't you?

27:57.476 --> 28:00.416
I have a degree in psychology. 
It goes with the turf.

28:00.586 --> 28:02.316
Games are fun.

28:02.356 --> 28:06.086
What about boxing? That's a game. 
Is that fun too?

28:06.156 --> 28:09.246
I don't think that's relevant to this inquiry.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.696
Boxing was fun 'til Manny died.

28:13.296 --> 28:14.656
How did you feel when he died?

28:14.696 --> 28:16.286
I loved him. It hurt.

28:16.366 --> 28:18.666
How did you feel when I told you 
Johnny Boz had died?

28:20.266 --> 28:22.636
I felt like someone had read my book 
and was playing a game.

28:22.676 --> 28:24.196
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.

28:24.276 --> 28:25.636
- Because you didn't love him?
- That's right.

28:25.676 --> 28:27.196
Even though you were fucking him?

28:27.276 --> 28:29.206
You still get the pleasure.

28:29.276 --> 28:32.146
Didn't you ever fuck anybody else 
when you were married, Nick?

28:32.186 --> 28:33.676
How'd you know he was married?

28:33.886 --> 28:36.176
Maybe I was just guessing.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.416
What difference does it make?

28:42.156 --> 28:44.316
Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

28:52.206 --> 28:55.166
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

28:58.876 --> 29:00.306
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

29:00.376 --> 29:03.866
I wanted to write a book about the murder 
of a retired rock and roll star.

29:04.046 --> 29:07.316
I went down to his club, I picked him up 
and I had sex with him.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.646
You didn't feel anything for him? 
You just had sex with him for your book?

29:12.886 --> 29:17.346
In the beginning. 
Then I got to like what he did for me.

29:18.396 --> 29:20.366
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

29:20.426 --> 29:23.156
I'm a writer. 
I use people for what I write.

29:23.196 --> 29:26.296
Let the world beware.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.606
Do you want me to take a lie detector test?

29:40.216 --> 29:42.186
<i>Wait here, please.</i>

29:49.196 --> 29:52.156
No blips, no blood pressure variations, 
no pulse variance.

29:52.226 --> 29:55.326
Either she's telling the truth, 
or I've never seen anyone like her.

29:57.966 --> 30:00.436
I guess that settles it.

30:02.876 --> 30:05.866
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can't fool the machine.

30:05.906 --> 30:07.306
Trust me. It can be done.

30:07.376 --> 30:09.206
And what makes you such an expert?

30:10.416 --> 30:12.936
Because I know people that have done it.

30:17.356 --> 30:18.876
Thank you.

30:18.956 --> 30:21.926
Thanks for coming in, Miss Tramell. 
Sorry to inconvenience you.

30:21.956 --> 30:24.446
Could someone give me a ride home?

30:24.526 --> 30:26.496
Sure.

30:27.696 --> 30:29.526
Thank you.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.656
Want to get a drink?

30:46.346 --> 30:49.316
- Rough day?
- Not really.

30:49.356 --> 30:51.876
Beating that machine can't be easy.

30:53.456 --> 30:57.416
If I was guilty and wanted to beat that machine, 
it wouldn't be hard.

30:59.266 --> 31:01.356
It wouldn't be hard at all.

31:03.496 --> 31:07.956
You took a lie detector test 
after you shot those two people, didn't you?

31:10.436 --> 31:11.666
I passed.

31:13.306 --> 31:16.506
You see? 
We're both innocent, Nick.

31:34.496 --> 31:38.026
You seem to know an awful lot about me.

31:38.236 --> 31:40.536
You know an awful lot about me.

31:42.276 --> 31:44.866
I don't know anything 
that's not police business.

31:47.946 --> 31:51.506
You know I don't wear any underwear. 
Don't you, Nick?

32:00.326 --> 32:02.886
Thanks for the ride.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.996
Would you like another glass of wine?

32:20.406 --> 32:22.506
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.246
What's all this "Nick" stuff?

32:26.286 --> 32:28.906
"Nick, do you want a cigarette? 
Nick, can I have a ride?"

32:28.986 --> 32:31.546
She didn't ask me to give her a ride. 
She asked anybody.

32:31.886 --> 32:34.286
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?

32:34.356 --> 32:37.686
No, Chuckie. 
Get me a double blackjack on the rocks, please.

32:39.496 --> 32:41.466
What you doing, Hoss?

32:42.936 --> 32:45.456
I haven't had a drink in three months.

32:45.536 --> 32:48.966
All right with you, cowboy?

32:49.006 --> 32:51.996
- She doesn't know me, okay?
- Here you go.

32:52.036 --> 32:55.036
I never seen her before Gus and I 
talked with her.

32:55.106 --> 32:57.046
- Thanks, Chuck.
- You're sure?

32:57.116 --> 32:59.106
Yes, I'm sure.

32:59.316 --> 33:01.076
Cheers.

33:08.456 --> 33:09.946
Now what?

33:10.026 --> 33:11.956
What "now what"? 
Now nothing.

33:11.996 --> 33:13.966
She passed the polygraph. 
That's it.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.056
She knew how to beat it, 
that's why she took it.

33:16.136 --> 33:19.326
How in the fuck do you know? 
What is it with you and this broad?

33:19.366 --> 33:21.996
Come on, Phil. 
Don't let this one slide.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.336
What about her parents? 
What about what else she published?

33:24.406 --> 33:26.376
Maybe all her books come true.

33:26.446 --> 33:29.436
Her parents died in an accident. 
I don't care what else she published.

33:29.516 --> 33:31.876
What are you, a book critic?

33:31.916 --> 33:35.046
How'd they die? 
Was there an investigation?

33:35.086 --> 33:38.386
You're saying she killed her parents? 
Did she kill Manny Vasquez too?

33:39.526 --> 33:43.546
Not unless she climbed into the ring 
and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.086
Maybe she did. 
Maybe she grew herself an afro...

33:47.166 --> 33:49.956
developed a hell of a left hook 
and put shoe polish all over her face.

33:49.996 --> 33:52.436
- Let's polygraph her again.
- Fuck you.

33:52.466 --> 33:54.006
Fuck you too.

33:54.006 --> 33:56.336
Don't worry, Phil. 
Nick'll fuck himself.

33:56.376 --> 34:00.176
You guys are very funny. 
Hey, Chuckie, get me another double.

34:00.346 --> 34:02.906
Hey, shooter!

34:02.976 --> 34:05.876
Are you back on the blackjack, shooter?

34:05.946 --> 34:09.406
- We're discussing a case here.
- I know that. I have no doubts.

34:09.485 --> 34:12.386
Here you go, Nick.

34:12.456 --> 34:15.426
A double, huh, shooter?

34:20.126 --> 34:21.496
I'm off duty, Nilsen.

34:24.366 --> 34:27.666
You hear me? 
I'm off duty discussing a case.

34:27.906 --> 34:30.376
Now, I.A. shouldn't have a problem with that.

34:32.376 --> 34:35.005
Maybe I should put in for some overtime?

34:36.916 --> 34:41.406
Don't work too hard, shooter. 
It might drive you to drink.

34:44.216 --> 34:47.886
Stop riding me, man! 
I'll kick your fucking teeth in!

34:47.956 --> 34:51.416
- What's the problem?
- No problem, Doctor.

34:51.456 --> 34:55.525
Here comes the shrink, just in time 
to save her favorite patient.

34:55.596 --> 34:57.126
Just fuck off, Marty!

34:58.936 --> 35:01.456
You kids have a good time tonight, huh?

35:07.146 --> 35:11.076
- He's asking for it.
- That's right, so don't take the bait.

35:14.216 --> 35:16.146
Do you want to go?

35:17.556 --> 35:19.516
- Yes.
- Let's go.

35:22.896 --> 35:26.516
Sometimes I think he started banging her 
just to get Internal Affairs off him.

35:26.596 --> 35:30.966
He ain't that way. 
He's got a heart.

37:43.066 --> 37:45.126
What was she like?

37:45.166 --> 37:47.926
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.

37:50.136 --> 37:52.976
You had her pegged. 
She used her book as an alibi.

37:56.046 --> 37:58.176
I met her at Berkeley.

38:00.286 --> 38:03.146
We were in some of the same classes.

38:03.186 --> 38:05.986
Why didn't you tell me?

38:06.056 --> 38:08.026
I'm telling you.

38:17.366 --> 38:21.306
You've never been like that before. Why?

38:21.336 --> 38:23.306
You tell me. 
You're the shrink.

38:26.046 --> 38:29.306
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?

38:29.346 --> 38:31.976
You weren't making love.

38:36.286 --> 38:37.946
I need a cigarette.

38:37.986 --> 38:40.216
I thought you said you quit.

38:46.166 --> 38:49.166
It's the top drawer in the foyer.

38:49.166 --> 38:52.156
Get it on your way out!

39:02.106 --> 39:04.906
- Have you started?
- Waitin' on you.

39:04.946 --> 39:08.146
- You look like dog shit.
- No, he looks a little shrunk is all.

39:08.216 --> 39:10.446
And not just in the head.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.286
All right, I made a couple of calls to Berkeley.

39:13.356 --> 39:16.086
There was a murder in '80. 
A professor.

39:16.126 --> 39:20.216
In his bed, multiple stab wounds, 
with an ice pick.

39:22.166 --> 39:24.396
Tramell was there then, wasn't she?

39:25.466 --> 39:29.126
University records say she was.

39:29.166 --> 39:32.006
Okay, let's move on this. 
Gus, get out to Berkeley.

39:32.076 --> 39:34.096
Harrigan, find out what else she's published.

39:34.176 --> 39:35.906
Andrews, get me that file 
on the parents' accident.

39:35.976 --> 39:38.466
Copy Beth on everything. 
I want psychological input.

39:38.946 --> 39:42.106
- What about me?
- You're already getting input.

39:42.186 --> 39:45.116
You go soak your head 
in a tub of ice water.

39:53.966 --> 39:55.426
You see where she leads.

43:20.366 --> 43:22.396
You have a good weekend.

43:22.466 --> 43:24.136
You too.

43:24.206 --> 43:25.506
Drive carefully.

43:25.676 --> 43:28.166
- I will.
- Bye-bye.

43:28.206 --> 43:29.476
I'll call you.

45:50.886 --> 45:54.516
Ain't you got nothing better to do 
than to jack off the damn machine?

45:54.686 --> 45:56.416
What are you doing here, cowboy?

45:56.456 --> 45:59.516
I came in here 
to jack off the damn machine.

45:59.656 --> 46:02.256
One dead psychology professor.

46:02.326 --> 46:06.356
Dr. Noah Goldstein. 
And guess what?

46:06.436 --> 46:09.306
He was her counselor.

46:09.336 --> 46:10.676
Was she a suspect?

46:10.676 --> 46:13.666
No, sir. 
They never even got a statement from her.

46:15.006 --> 46:17.376
Hazel Dobkins?

46:17.446 --> 46:19.306
Do you know her?

46:19.376 --> 46:21.906
Couldn't get it out of my head for years.

46:21.986 --> 46:24.506
Nice little housewife. 
Three little kids.

46:24.556 --> 46:28.356
Nice husband wasn't porking around. 
No financial problems.

46:28.426 --> 46:33.256
One day, out of the clear blue sky, 
she does them, all of them.

46:33.296 --> 46:36.356
Used a knife she got for a wedding present.

46:36.436 --> 46:39.696
Didn't even deny it. 
Sweet as honey.

46:39.936 --> 46:42.666
Said she didn't know why she'd done it.

46:55.416 --> 46:58.386
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?

46:58.416 --> 47:01.416
No, come on in.

47:02.456 --> 47:04.426
Let's go upstairs.

47:21.446 --> 47:23.536
I'm using you for my detective in my book.

47:24.876 --> 47:26.906
You don't mind, do you?

47:29.446 --> 47:32.416
I was just gonna make myself a drink.

47:32.456 --> 47:34.446
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

47:34.526 --> 47:38.456
Oh, right. 
You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

47:42.166 --> 47:44.326
I've got a few more questions to ask you.

47:44.396 --> 47:47.456
I have some for you too. 
For my book.

47:57.476 --> 48:00.466
Do you have something against ice cubes?

48:00.516 --> 48:02.506
I like rough edges.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.546
So, what did you want to ask me?

48:05.686 --> 48:08.116
How does it feel to kill someone?

48:11.026 --> 48:12.426
You tell me.

48:14.426 --> 48:16.986
I don't know, but you do.

48:18.536 --> 48:20.466
It was an accident.

48:20.536 --> 48:22.436
They got in the line of fire.

48:25.936 --> 48:29.506
Four shootings in five years, 
all accidents?

48:31.376 --> 48:34.376
They were drug buys. 
I was working undercover.

48:36.346 --> 48:39.186
You want to tell me 
about Professor Goldstein?

48:42.126 --> 48:44.526
Well, there's a name from the past.

48:44.596 --> 48:47.896
You want a name from the present? 
What about Hazel Dobkins?

48:49.596 --> 48:53.466
Noah Goldstein was my counselor, 
my fresh man year. 

48:53.536 --> 48:56.996
That's probably where I got the idea 
for the ice pick for my book.

48:59.036 --> 49:01.166
Funny how the subconscious works.

49:01.376 --> 49:02.866
Hilarious.

49:05.046 --> 49:08.986
- Hazel's my friend.
- Your friend took out her whole family.

49:09.046 --> 49:12.146
Yes, she helped me understand homicidal impulse.

49:12.186 --> 49:14.156
I thought you would have learned that at school.

49:15.956 --> 49:17.926
Only in theory.

49:17.956 --> 49:23.126
But you know all about homicidal impulse, 
don't you, shooter?

49:25.496 --> 49:28.096
Not in theory, in practice.

49:28.166 --> 49:31.966
What happened? 
Did you get sucked into it?

49:32.006 --> 49:34.876
Did you like it too much?

49:36.546 --> 49:39.376
I don't know what you're talking about.

49:41.246 --> 49:43.976
Tell me about the coke, Nick.

49:46.056 --> 49:49.046
The day you shot those two tourists...

49:49.126 --> 49:51.096
how much coke did you do?

49:54.896 --> 49:58.096
Come on, you can tell me.

50:04.036 --> 50:07.906
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

50:07.946 --> 50:11.176
They never tested you, did they?

50:11.216 --> 50:14.186
Internal Affairs knew.

50:16.246 --> 50:19.246
Your wife knew too, didn't she?

50:24.556 --> 50:27.086
She knew what was going on.

50:29.966 --> 50:31.956
I think you got too close to the flame.

50:39.976 --> 50:41.966
I think you liked it.

50:46.276 --> 50:49.076
That's why she killed herself.

51:04.296 --> 51:06.286
Hi, hon.

51:10.506 --> 51:13.996
You two have met, haven't you?

51:22.546 --> 51:26.076
You're gonna make a terrific character, Nick.

51:35.026 --> 51:38.600
She's on the phone. 
She'll be right with you.

51:38.630 --> 51:43.296
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Detective, you can't go in...

51:43.336 --> 51:46.066
- Who's got access to my file?
- What are you talking about?

51:46.106 --> 51:48.196
Who has access to my goddamn file?

51:48.276 --> 51:52.106
Nobody. It's a confidential psychiatric record. 
It would be illegal.

51:52.176 --> 51:54.946
Don't you fucking lie to me!

51:55.016 --> 51:56.986
It was Internal Affairs, wasn't it?

51:57.056 --> 51:58.076
No, please.

51:58.156 --> 52:01.126
- Who?
- It's Nilson.

52:12.966 --> 52:14.336
What do you want, Curran?

52:14.536 --> 52:16.026
You sold her my file, didn't you?

52:16.066 --> 52:18.126
Who are you talking about?

52:18.176 --> 52:21.576
Catherine Tramell. 
How much did she pay you?

52:21.906 --> 52:25.246
Hey, Curran, come on! 
Damn it, stop it!

52:25.316 --> 52:26.576
How much?

52:28.946 --> 52:32.576
Hey, back off! 
Back off, Curran!

52:32.616 --> 52:35.956
Nice and easy now. 
Nice and easy.

52:36.026 --> 52:38.956
You fucked yourself, shooter. 
You hear me? You are out!

52:39.026 --> 52:41.426
- Curran, take it easy.
- You are out!

52:43.166 --> 52:44.596
Save it, save it.

52:48.106 --> 52:50.296
- What's going down, Hoss?
- Nothing. I'll be okay.

52:50.376 --> 52:53.636
- They're gonna want your badge.
- I'm tired of being played with.

52:53.976 --> 52:56.306
You got a real conclusive way 
of demonstrating that.

53:02.286 --> 53:05.916
She knows where I live and breathe.

53:07.386 --> 53:09.356
She's coming after me, Gus.

53:10.356 --> 53:12.296
What is it you got between you?

53:15.966 --> 53:19.956
- I don't know.
- Something, though.

53:20.036 --> 53:23.096
Something.

53:42.186 --> 53:44.156
Nick, are you there?

53:44.196 --> 53:47.126
Go away, Beth. 
I don't want to see you.

53:53.366 --> 53:56.196
I still have my key.

53:58.006 --> 53:59.936
Put them on the table and leave.

54:02.406 --> 54:05.176
Put them on the goddamn table and leave!

54:05.246 --> 54:08.276
Damn it! Don't shove me out! 
You owe me more than that!

54:10.956 --> 54:13.356
I don't owe you anything!

54:13.386 --> 54:16.256
And you don't owe me anything.

54:16.286 --> 54:19.386
We went to bed, what, 10, 15 times?

54:19.456 --> 54:23.256
It wasn't memorable enough 
to carry an obligation.

54:25.166 --> 54:27.926
Sometimes I really hate you.

54:27.966 --> 54:30.456
Why don't you get yourself 
some friendly little therapist...

54:30.976 --> 54:33.166
to work out some of that hostility?

54:33.206 --> 54:36.336
And maybe you can get off once in a while.

54:39.246 --> 54:42.076
Are you nuts?

54:51.196 --> 54:52.456
I'm sorry.

54:54.996 --> 54:57.326
I don't usually act like that.

54:57.396 --> 55:00.166
How could you give him my file?

55:00.236 --> 55:01.926
I had to!

55:02.006 --> 55:05.936
He was going to recommend 
your discharge from the force.

55:05.976 --> 55:09.166
He didn't buy my evaluation. 
He said I wasn't objective.

55:09.206 --> 55:13.116
So I made a deal with him 
to review the session notes himself.

55:13.116 --> 55:15.346
I didn't think he'd show them to anybody.

55:15.416 --> 55:18.286
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

55:18.356 --> 55:21.086
I care about you. I did it for you.

55:26.296 --> 55:30.026
Go away. Please, just go away.

56:04.396 --> 56:07.336
I'm on my way.

56:57.556 --> 57:02.116
One shot. Close range. 
Probably a .38 caliber revolver.

57:03.386 --> 57:06.016
Give me your gun, Nick.

57:15.066 --> 57:17.466
You think that...

57:21.376 --> 57:25.276
I don't, Hoss. 
But I got the minority opinion.

57:29.646 --> 57:34.276
Okay, I went after him! 
I lost my temper.

57:34.356 --> 57:37.346
Do you have any evidence that he showed 
your psychiatric file to anyone?

57:44.336 --> 57:46.296
We'll speak with you afterwards, Dr. Garner.

57:46.336 --> 57:48.326
- I'd like to sit in.
- I'd really rather wait...

57:48.406 --> 57:52.336
It's all right if Dr. Garner sits in, 
if Detective Curran doesn't object.

57:58.246 --> 58:01.216
- Where were you last night?
- Home, watching TV.

58:01.246 --> 58:03.046
All night?

58:03.686 --> 58:05.246
Yes, all night.

58:05.316 --> 58:07.476
Were you drinking?

58:11.256 --> 58:13.086
Yeah, I was drinking.

58:13.126 --> 58:16.096
- When did you start drinking again?
- A couple of days ago.

58:16.126 --> 58:19.366
I saw Detective Curran at his apartment 
about 10:00 last night.

58:19.436 --> 58:21.336
He was sober and lucid.

58:21.406 --> 58:24.166
I asked him, in my capacity 
as his departmental therapist...

58:24.206 --> 58:26.296
about his altercation with Lieutenant Nilsen.

58:26.336 --> 58:29.636
He expressed regret 
and displayed no hostility.

58:29.876 --> 58:33.476
- How long were you at his apartment?
- About 15 minutes.

58:33.646 --> 58:37.136
I saw there was no reason 
for my concern and left.

58:37.216 --> 58:39.876
There's no smoking in this building, Detective.

58:42.126 --> 58:44.086
What are you gonna do? 
Charge me with smoking?

58:45.656 --> 58:49.326
Oh, for Christ's... All right, Nick, 
I'm gonna ask you this just once.

58:49.396 --> 58:52.666
For the record, did you kill Marty Nilsen?

58:54.466 --> 58:56.496
No.

58:56.666 --> 58:59.296
I'm gonna storm into his office 
in front of everybody...

58:59.376 --> 59:01.346
in the middle of the day 
and kill him that night?

59:01.376 --> 59:03.346
I'm not that dumb.

59:03.406 --> 59:07.366
Going after him before gets you off the hook 
for killing him. That's your alibi.

59:07.416 --> 59:11.076
Like writing a book about killing a guy 
gets you off the hook for killing him.

59:11.156 --> 59:12.136
Good point.

59:12.216 --> 59:14.156
What are you talking about?

59:14.186 --> 59:17.486
- A private joke, asshole.
- I don't think it's funny.

59:17.656 --> 59:19.126
You're going on leave...

59:20.196 --> 59:23.456
pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation.

59:35.506 --> 59:38.206
I'll get my stuff in a minute.

59:42.586 --> 59:43.916
Thank you.

59:48.356 --> 59:50.446
It's the least I could do.

59:50.526 --> 59:53.356
Considering I got you into this mess 
with those reports.

59:53.426 --> 59:56.196
No, I mean it. 
Thank you.

59:57.996 --> 01:00:00.966
How do you know 
Catherine Tramell saw your file?

01:00:01.006 --> 01:00:04.666
She knows things about me 
that I only told you.

01:00:04.906 --> 01:00:07.306
She must really be something.

01:00:07.376 --> 01:00:09.866
From a clinical point of view.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:12.506
- What was she like in school?
- I hardly knew her.

01:00:12.546 --> 01:00:14.346
She gave me the creeps.

01:00:14.416 --> 01:00:16.346
I don't know why.

01:00:20.456 --> 01:00:23.476
Get some rest. 
Promise?

01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:32.486
- I didn't mean what I said about...
- Yes, you did.

01:00:32.566 --> 01:00:35.536
I'm a big girl. 
I can handle it.

01:00:59.396 --> 01:01:02.486
- You take care of yourself.
- What'd you find out about the parents?

01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:05.496
No lead, man.

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:08.896
You're on psycho leave. 
I'm talking to a possible wacko!

01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:11.906
You know I'm wacko. 
What'd you find out?

01:01:15.406 --> 01:01:19.006
The boat blew. 
There was a leak in the fuel line.

01:01:19.216 --> 01:01:23.046
There were two previous repairs 
and a five mil policy on both of them.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.416
A real heavy investigation 
but they got zilch.

01:01:25.456 --> 01:01:28.286
Big goose egg. 
It was an "accident."

01:01:28.326 --> 01:01:31.916
I.A.'s gonna talk to you about Nilsen. 
They're handling the investigation.

01:01:31.956 --> 01:01:34.486
Stay in touch with Dr. Garner. 
It'll help on the evaluation.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:38.256
She killed him.

01:01:38.336 --> 01:01:39.896
Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?

01:01:39.936 --> 01:01:41.866
Catherine Tramell. 
It's part of her game.

01:01:41.936 --> 01:01:45.966
First you got her stealing your file, 
now she's killing Nilsen?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.976
Forget about her! 
Go somewhere, sit in the sun.

01:01:49.046 --> 01:01:52.446
- Get her the hell out of your system!
- You don't buy it, do you?

01:01:52.516 --> 01:01:54.876
She knew nobody'd buy it.

01:01:54.946 --> 01:01:58.316
She knew I'd say she did it 
and nobody'd buy it!

01:01:58.356 --> 01:02:01.516
She is screwing with your head! 
Stay away from her!

01:02:29.086 --> 01:02:30.516
I heard what happened.

01:02:39.296 --> 01:02:42.356
What good's a shooter without his gun?

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.396
- How exactly did you find out?
- I have attorneys.

01:02:45.466 --> 01:02:48.436
They have friends. I have friends.

01:02:48.506 --> 01:02:51.096
Money buys a lot of attorneys and friends.

01:02:51.306 --> 01:02:53.436
I wouldn't know about that. 
I don't have any money...

01:02:53.506 --> 01:02:57.306
I don't have any attorneys, 
and Gus is my only real friend.

01:02:57.376 --> 01:02:59.436
I wasn't talking about real friends.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.316
Why doesn't Gus like me?

01:03:07.086 --> 01:03:09.116
I like you.

01:03:09.326 --> 01:03:11.886
- You do?
- Yes.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:16.126
You want to go upstairs and have a drink?

01:03:17.396 --> 01:03:19.126
I didn't think you'd ask me.

01:03:20.866 --> 01:03:23.136
I guess you don't know your character that well.

01:03:23.336 --> 01:03:27.036
Maybe, but I'm learning.

01:03:27.106 --> 01:03:29.936
Pretty soon I'll know you better 
than you know yourself.

01:03:29.976 --> 01:03:32.106
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:34.946
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?

01:03:44.996 --> 01:03:47.156
You should put some warmth into the place.

01:03:47.196 --> 01:03:49.956
You don't want it 
to reflect your personality.

01:03:49.996 --> 01:03:51.556
I'm not trying to fool anybody.

01:03:51.636 --> 01:03:54.466
Jack Daniels all right? 
It's going to have to be.

01:03:54.506 --> 01:03:56.466
- Ice?
- Great.

01:04:04.976 --> 01:04:06.066
I was expecting you.

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.546
K-Mart. 
A buck, sixty-five.

01:04:19.026 --> 01:04:21.156
Why don't you let me do this for you.

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:31.406
You like watching me do it, don't you?

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:37.006
Could I have a cigarette too, please?

01:04:37.046 --> 01:04:39.516
I told you you'd start smoking again.

01:04:39.546 --> 01:04:42.536
Would you light it for me?

01:04:47.756 --> 01:04:49.686
Thanks.

01:04:51.386 --> 01:04:55.916
So how much did you pay Nilsen for my file?

01:04:55.956 --> 01:05:00.416
Isn't he the policeman 
that you shot, shooter?

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.796
What if I ask you 
not to call me "shooter"?

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:06.426
Okay. How about if I call you Nicky?

01:05:07.876 --> 01:05:10.496
My wife used to call me Nicky.

01:05:10.846 --> 01:05:15.146
Yeah, I know. 
I like it.

01:05:18.516 --> 01:05:21.386
Cheers. 
My friends call me Catherine.

01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:24.186
What did Manny Vasquez call you?

01:05:24.226 --> 01:05:26.056
Bitch, mostly.

01:05:26.126 --> 01:05:28.456
But he meant it affectionately.

01:05:30.096 --> 01:05:32.116
Do you have any coke?

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.456
I just love coke with Jack Daniels.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.466
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

01:05:37.536 --> 01:05:41.096
It's not really the same thing now, is it?

01:05:41.406 --> 01:05:43.376
No, it's not.

01:05:46.386 --> 01:05:48.346
So where's this going?

01:05:51.456 --> 01:05:54.116
What do you want from me?

01:05:56.456 --> 01:06:00.186
Say, "what do you want from me, Catherine?"

01:06:01.496 --> 01:06:05.126
What the fuck do you want from me, Catherine?

01:06:12.006 --> 01:06:14.096
Brought you something.

01:06:18.416 --> 01:06:23.246
Aren't you going to say thank-you?

01:06:23.316 --> 01:06:26.586
- What's it about?
- It's about a boy who kills his parents.

01:06:26.656 --> 01:06:29.646
They have a play, 
and he makes it look like an accident.

01:06:32.996 --> 01:06:34.156
Why did he do that?

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:38.656
To see if he could get away with it.

01:06:41.406 --> 01:06:43.066
When did you write this?

01:06:44.106 --> 01:06:47.076
You mean, did I write it 
before my parents died?

01:06:51.676 --> 01:06:54.676
No. I wrote it years afterwards.

01:06:56.416 --> 01:07:00.116
You wont stop following me around now 
just because you're on leave?

01:07:00.156 --> 01:07:01.456
Absolutely not.

01:07:03.356 --> 01:07:05.256
Good, I'd miss you.

01:07:05.326 --> 01:07:07.486
You could get in trouble. 
You're not really a cop anymore.

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:10.656
- I'll risk it.
- Why take the risk?

01:07:10.996 --> 01:07:13.936
To see if I can get away with it.

01:07:16.106 --> 01:07:19.636
- How's your new book?
- Practically writing itself.

01:07:20.976 --> 01:07:24.176
I'll be leaving about midnight, 
in case you are going to follow me.

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:30.446
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.
- I'll meet you there.

01:07:32.086 --> 01:07:34.016
Hi, Gus.

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:53.266
Forgive me for asking, 
and I don't mean to belabor the obvious... 

01:07:53.306 --> 01:07:57.336
but why've you got your head 
so far up your own ass?

01:07:57.416 --> 01:08:00.436
She wants to play. 
Fine, I can play.

01:08:02.216 --> 01:08:04.416
Everybody she plays with dies.

01:08:05.486 --> 01:08:08.076
I know what that's like.

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:04.475
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

01:16:37.096 --> 01:16:40.066
If you don't leave her alone, 
I'll kill you.

01:16:46.136 --> 01:16:48.406
Let me ask you something, "Rocky."

01:16:50.146 --> 01:16:51.576
Man to man.

01:16:54.046 --> 01:16:56.646
I think she's the fuck of the century.

01:17:00.526 --> 01:17:02.516
What do you think?

01:17:07.026 --> 01:17:08.556
How long you been here?

01:17:10.196 --> 01:17:13.096
You like watching, don't you?

01:17:16.566 --> 01:17:18.566
She likes me to watch.

01:18:03.186 --> 01:18:05.156
Oh, God.

01:18:10.026 --> 01:18:12.186
<i>The beach C</i>

01:18:55.206 --> 01:18:57.136
Good morning.

01:18:58.236 --> 01:19:00.536
I guess Roxy's not taking this too well.

01:19:01.476 --> 01:19:04.566
She's seen me fuck plenty of guys.

01:19:04.616 --> 01:19:09.446
Well, maybe she saw something 
she's never seen before.

01:19:09.486 --> 01:19:11.216
She's seen everything before.

01:19:11.286 --> 01:19:14.656
Honey, I thought I'd seen everything before.

01:19:14.986 --> 01:19:17.286
Did you really think it was so special?

01:19:17.496 --> 01:19:21.156
I told her I thought 
it was the fuck of the century.

01:19:26.236 --> 01:19:27.966
What do you think?

01:19:28.036 --> 01:19:32.026
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

01:19:35.946 --> 01:19:37.206
What about Roxy?

01:19:37.276 --> 01:19:39.546
Is she more fun?

01:19:39.616 --> 01:19:42.546
Would you like her to join us sometime?

01:19:42.616 --> 01:19:47.346
- Did she join you and Johnny?
- No, he felt intimidated.

01:19:47.526 --> 01:19:49.616
Look what happened to him.

01:19:49.686 --> 01:19:52.596
Tell me, were you frightened last night?

01:19:52.626 --> 01:19:54.186
That's the point, wasn't it?

01:19:54.266 --> 01:19:56.256
That's what made it so good.

01:19:57.636 --> 01:20:01.626
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.

01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:03.106
You're in over your head.

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:07.096
Maybe, but this is how I'll catch my killer.

01:20:11.246 --> 01:20:16.576
I'm not going to confess all my secrets 
just because I have an orgasm.

01:20:16.576 --> 01:20:19.276
You won't learn anything 
I don't want you to know.

01:20:19.316 --> 01:20:23.616
Yes, I will. 
Then I'll nail you.

01:20:23.616 --> 01:20:27.256
You'll just fall in love with me.

01:20:27.296 --> 01:20:29.316
I'm in love with you already.

01:20:33.166 --> 01:20:35.366
But I'll nail you anyway.

01:20:36.566 --> 01:20:39.096
You can put that in your book.

01:20:43.346 --> 01:20:44.576
<i>No</i>

01:20:44.616 --> 01:20:48.566
<i>Not that bar again</i>

01:20:50.186 --> 01:20:53.416
<i>Oh, I want to know you're the one</i>

01:20:53.586 --> 01:20:56.746
<i>And I don't mean the one I regret</i>

01:20:59.196 --> 01:21:01.096
<i>The heart's still going</i>

01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:04.256
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Where the fuck you been?

01:21:04.296 --> 01:21:08.136
- I've been over to your place.
- Easy, cowboy, easy.

01:21:09.266 --> 01:21:13.176
- I wasn't there.
- I went over last night too.

01:21:14.246 --> 01:21:16.406
Well, I wasn't there either.

01:21:22.246 --> 01:21:23.716
You fucked her.

01:21:24.576 --> 01:21:27.616
God damned, dumb son of a bitch!

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:30.116
You fucked her!

01:21:30.186 --> 01:21:32.286
God damn! You are one...

01:21:32.356 --> 01:21:34.346
dumb son of a bitch!

01:21:34.396 --> 01:21:35.586
Next time, I'll use a rubber.

01:21:35.586 --> 01:21:40.396
I don't give a flying, 
chili bean fart about that!

01:21:40.466 --> 01:21:43.436
- How about it, Harry. How much?
- Thirty-two.

01:21:43.606 --> 01:21:46.166
I'm worried about him, 
he's worried about rubbers.

01:21:46.236 --> 01:21:48.136
You really gotta protect yourself.

01:21:48.206 --> 01:21:50.736
What in the hell for?

01:21:51.076 --> 01:21:56.276
You think I'm getting any? 
Sure, I can get laid by blue haired women!

01:21:56.346 --> 01:22:00.046
- I don't like them!
- Don't knock it 'til you tried it!

01:22:06.196 --> 01:22:07.286
Feeling better?

01:22:07.326 --> 01:22:10.266
I feel fine.

01:22:10.296 --> 01:22:11.456
How could you fuck her?

01:22:13.096 --> 01:22:14.436
Come on.

01:22:18.336 --> 01:22:20.466
You want to die, Hoss?

01:22:20.676 --> 01:22:22.646
What is it? 
Those tourists?

01:22:24.116 --> 01:22:28.446
You still so bad about that, 
you're wiggling your way into an ice pick?

01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:31.646
Got too many god damn tourists 
coming here anyway!

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:35.516
- Hold it down.
- Plenty more where they came from!

01:22:45.396 --> 01:22:47.196
I'm not afraid of her.

01:22:47.236 --> 01:22:48.466
Why the hell not?

01:22:51.336 --> 01:22:53.306
I don't know.

01:22:53.336 --> 01:22:54.496
I'm just not.

01:22:54.706 --> 01:22:57.196
That's her pussy talking! 
It ain't your brain!

01:22:57.276 --> 01:22:59.506
Come on.

01:23:08.086 --> 01:23:12.256
I.A. did a track on Lieutenant Martin 
D-for-dickhead Nilsen. 

01:23:12.326 --> 01:23:15.486
They found a safety deposit box 
with $50,000 in it...

01:23:15.566 --> 01:23:18.726
taken out three months ago 
and not used since.

01:23:20.366 --> 01:23:23.536
That doesn't make any sense. 
She didn't know me three months ago.

01:23:23.536 --> 01:23:25.466
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.

01:23:25.536 --> 01:23:28.376
Maybe the money was for something else. 
How the fuck do I know?

01:23:31.536 --> 01:23:37.006
I'm just an old city cowboy 
trying not to fall out of his saddle.

01:23:50.566 --> 01:23:53.496
- All right, cowboy?
- Yeah.

01:23:53.496 --> 01:23:55.496
Come on. 
I'm going to drive you home.

01:23:55.496 --> 01:23:58.196
In that little piss-ant car of yours?

01:23:58.236 --> 01:24:02.296
Hell, no. I ain't getting 
no back pain disability retirement.

01:24:02.376 --> 01:24:07.436
I'm gonna get a full pension 
and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

01:24:07.516 --> 01:24:09.116
I'm driving you...

01:24:09.116 --> 01:24:11.316
You're not driving my Cadillac car!

01:24:11.386 --> 01:24:16.256
I won't let no head-up-his-ass person 
drive my Cadillac car!

01:24:16.326 --> 01:24:17.486
So long!

01:26:17.446 --> 01:26:19.416
You wanna play? Come on!

01:27:30.146 --> 01:27:32.276
Lieutenant! 
I got the information.

01:27:32.356 --> 01:27:34.326
Get it down here!

01:27:34.326 --> 01:27:36.656
You signed your name 
to this crock of shit?

01:27:36.656 --> 01:27:38.316
Why not? 
It was an accident.

01:27:38.356 --> 01:27:42.386
"Your driving around North Beach 
and this car won't get out of the way."

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:44.326
I don't think she meant to go off the edge.

01:27:44.366 --> 01:27:47.166
- Could we have him for a minute?
- No, you can't!

01:27:47.196 --> 01:27:51.156
Don't fuck with me on this. 
I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

01:27:51.236 --> 01:27:54.466
Full name is Roxanne Hardy. 
Last known address, Cloverdale, California.

01:27:54.506 --> 01:27:56.496
No priors, no convictions.

01:27:56.576 --> 01:27:59.736
Car is registered to Catherine Trammel.

01:27:59.946 --> 01:28:01.936
- You knew her!
- I met her at Trammel's house.

01:28:01.986 --> 01:28:03.446
All I did was write her name down.

01:28:03.516 --> 01:28:06.606
You wrote her name down 
and then big surprise...

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:09.346
she rolls her car down a hill and dies.

01:28:09.426 --> 01:28:13.286
- Is that what you're telling me?
- That's all I know.

01:28:13.326 --> 01:28:16.416
You know what then? Fuck you!

01:28:18.396 --> 01:28:21.386
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office...
- I told you to stay away from Trammel!

01:28:21.436 --> 01:28:23.196
You didn't tell me 
to stay away from the car!

01:28:23.236 --> 01:28:27.536
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office!
- Who are you selling my file to now?

01:28:29.276 --> 01:28:32.436
You are out of control, Curran. 
You hear me?

01:28:41.756 --> 01:28:44.656
Hello, Nick. 
This is Dr. Myron...

01:28:44.726 --> 01:28:46.656
and Dr. McElwaine.

01:28:48.296 --> 01:28:53.166
They've been asked to consult with me 
on this psychiatric evaluation.

01:28:53.336 --> 01:28:55.126
Sit down.

01:29:02.146 --> 01:29:05.576
We understand you're having difficulty 
controlling your temper lately.

01:29:05.646 --> 01:29:08.376
Only in regard to one person.

01:29:09.446 --> 01:29:13.316
Do you think Lieutenant Nilsen 
deserved to die?

01:29:14.486 --> 01:29:16.426
I didn't know him well enough.

01:29:16.456 --> 01:29:17.686
I won't miss him.

01:29:20.496 --> 01:29:23.356
When you recollect your childhood...

01:29:23.426 --> 01:29:26.056
are your recollections pleasing to you?

01:29:29.066 --> 01:29:33.476
Number one: I don't remember how often 
I jerked off, but it was a lot.

01:29:33.506 --> 01:29:35.736
Number two: 
I wasn't pissed off at my dad...

01:29:36.076 --> 01:29:38.666
even when I was old enough to know 
what he and mom did in the bedroom.

01:29:38.746 --> 01:29:42.076
Number three: 
I don't look in the toilet before I flush.

01:29:42.146 --> 01:29:45.486
Number four: 
I haven't wet my bed for a long time.

01:29:45.556 --> 01:29:47.676
Number five...

01:29:47.756 --> 01:29:50.156
why don't the two of you go fuck yourselves.

01:29:50.186 --> 01:29:52.156
I'm out of here.

01:29:59.566 --> 01:30:01.556
What's your problem? 
I'm trying to help.

01:30:01.636 --> 01:30:03.466
- Why won't you let me?
- I don't want your help!

01:30:03.536 --> 01:30:05.436
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do!

01:30:05.506 --> 01:30:07.496
Something's going on.

01:30:07.576 --> 01:30:09.596
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

01:30:09.646 --> 01:30:13.606
- Why are you interested in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.

01:30:13.646 --> 01:30:15.616
She seduces and manipulates people.

01:30:15.686 --> 01:30:18.376
- She'll do anything she can...
- I thought you hardly knew her?

01:30:18.456 --> 01:30:20.746
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
- That means...

01:30:21.086 --> 01:30:23.576
you manipulate people too!

01:30:23.656 --> 01:30:25.746
You're a practicing psychologist.

01:30:26.126 --> 01:30:28.186
You're better at it than she is!

01:30:29.726 --> 01:30:32.696
I feel sorry for you!

01:31:30.126 --> 01:31:32.146
I should have known.

01:31:36.226 --> 01:31:38.756
I came in to the house.

01:31:38.836 --> 01:31:40.696
When we were down on the beach...

01:31:42.466 --> 01:31:45.126
she looked at me so strangely.

01:31:47.636 --> 01:31:49.806
She left right after you.

01:31:54.546 --> 01:31:56.536
I...

01:31:57.586 --> 01:32:00.646
I shouldn't have let her watch us.

01:32:02.586 --> 01:32:05.246
She wanted to watch me all the time.

01:32:11.666 --> 01:32:15.756
She tried to kill you, didn't she?

01:32:16.106 --> 01:32:20.296
- Did you like her to watch you?
- You think I told her to kill you?

01:32:20.506 --> 01:32:22.306
No.

01:32:25.276 --> 01:32:29.216
Everybody that I care about...

01:32:29.286 --> 01:32:31.246
dies.

01:32:50.736 --> 01:32:52.676
Make love to me.

01:33:12.226 --> 01:33:16.186
You think she killed Johnny Boz?

01:33:16.226 --> 01:33:19.286
For what, to set me up?

01:33:19.366 --> 01:33:21.736
She loved me. 
She wouldn't frame me.

01:33:22.736 --> 01:33:27.106
- Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.
- No, she didn't.

01:33:27.176 --> 01:33:30.146
She'd never get jealous before.

01:33:30.206 --> 01:33:32.196
She got excited.

01:33:35.246 --> 01:33:38.216
I don't have luck with women.

01:33:39.686 --> 01:33:41.816
There was this girl...

01:33:42.156 --> 01:33:44.626
I met when I was in college.

01:33:44.656 --> 01:33:46.216
I slept with her once.

01:33:46.296 --> 01:33:50.786
She started following me around, 
taking my picture.

01:33:51.166 --> 01:33:55.296
She dyed her hair, copied my clothes.

01:33:55.366 --> 01:33:57.336
Lisa...

01:33:58.376 --> 01:34:00.306
something, Oberman.

01:34:04.376 --> 01:34:06.366
It was awful.

01:34:08.386 --> 01:34:10.376
I thought you didn't make confessions.

01:34:14.686 --> 01:34:16.716
I never did before.

01:34:27.136 --> 01:34:28.296
Another nice girl.

01:34:47.286 --> 01:34:48.756
How old was she when it happened?

01:34:48.786 --> 01:34:50.776
Sixteen.

01:34:51.126 --> 01:34:53.386
We seal juvenile records 
until they're deceased.

01:34:53.456 --> 01:34:55.396
That's why you couldn't find it 
in your computer.

01:34:55.466 --> 01:34:58.256
What was the motive?

01:34:58.336 --> 01:35:01.236
She said she didn't know. 
Just sort of did it on impulse.

01:35:01.266 --> 01:35:05.256
The razor just happened to be there. 
That's what she said.

01:35:10.776 --> 01:35:14.716
- Help yourself to some coffee.
- Thanks.

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:17.716
I don't understand what the hell 
is going on here.

01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:20.246
It ain't hard, Hoss. 
This young farm girl...

01:35:20.286 --> 01:35:23.656
got tired of all that attention 
going to her little brothers...

01:35:23.686 --> 01:35:25.786
so she fixed them.

01:35:26.126 --> 01:35:29.116
Just like old Hazel Dobkins 
fixed her whole family.

01:35:29.166 --> 01:35:31.726
Except young Roxy here, 
didn't use a wedding present.

01:35:31.796 --> 01:35:34.396
She used daddy's razor.

01:35:43.376 --> 01:35:45.276
Sure makes you wonder what they talk about...

01:35:45.346 --> 01:35:48.336
when they sit in front 
of the campfire at night.

01:35:48.386 --> 01:35:51.786
You ever met a friend of hers 
that hasn't killed somebody?

01:35:51.816 --> 01:35:54.816
Must of beat your ordinary, 
every day girl talk.

01:35:54.816 --> 01:35:57.416
I'm not sure, anymore, she did it.

01:35:57.456 --> 01:35:59.516
Which one we talking about now?

01:35:59.696 --> 01:36:02.786
We know Hazel did it. 
We know young Roxy did it.

01:36:03.166 --> 01:36:04.356
And the other one...

01:36:04.396 --> 01:36:09.736
She's got that magna cum laude pussy 
that fried up your brain.

01:36:28.856 --> 01:36:31.416
"Oberman, Mark W., Donald M."

01:36:32.496 --> 01:36:33.856
Sorry, no "Lisa."

01:36:34.156 --> 01:36:36.596
You sure about the year?

01:36:36.766 --> 01:36:39.756
Catherine Tramell graduated in '83.

01:36:39.796 --> 01:36:43.566
She said Lisa Oberman was here 
at the same time.

01:36:46.336 --> 01:36:48.136
Yeah, we have Tramell.

01:36:51.576 --> 01:36:53.166
But no Lisa Oberman.

01:36:53.216 --> 01:36:55.546
Are you sure? 
There can't be a mistake?

01:36:57.346 --> 01:36:59.746
Only if you're making it, Detective.

01:37:14.336 --> 01:37:17.136
Hazel, this is Nick. 
I told you all about him.

01:37:17.166 --> 01:37:19.196
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.

01:37:19.276 --> 01:37:21.326
You're the shooter, aren't you?

01:37:21.406 --> 01:37:23.376
How are you?

01:37:23.406 --> 01:37:26.206
Fine, thank you. 
Can I speak to you for a minute?

01:37:26.276 --> 01:37:30.576
Would you wait for me in the car? 
I'll be right there.

01:37:31.786 --> 01:37:33.586
Good-bye, shooter.

01:37:35.326 --> 01:37:38.186
You like to hang out with murderers, or what?

01:37:38.256 --> 01:37:41.316
- You know that Roxy was involved...
- Yes, of course, I knew.

01:37:41.396 --> 01:37:44.326
I write about unusual people,
 and sometimes when I do my research...

01:37:44.366 --> 01:37:46.626
I get involved with them.

01:37:46.666 --> 01:37:49.256
It happened with you.

01:37:50.436 --> 01:37:53.336
Killing isn't like smoking.

01:37:53.376 --> 01:37:55.566
You can quit.

01:37:57.846 --> 01:38:00.276
I gotta go.

01:38:01.476 --> 01:38:03.506
I promised I'd get her home by 6:00.

01:38:03.586 --> 01:38:06.376
She just loves "America's Most Wanted."

01:38:06.416 --> 01:38:10.186
There was no Lisa Oberman 
when you were at Berkeley.

01:38:10.226 --> 01:38:13.416
What are you doing? 
Checking up on me?

01:38:13.456 --> 01:38:16.516
For what? 
I said "Hoberman."

01:38:19.366 --> 01:38:23.306
"Hoberman." Lisa Hoberman, with an H.

01:38:24.666 --> 01:38:26.636
You do?

01:38:28.646 --> 01:38:31.506
All right. 
Thank you very much.

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.386
You know I can get my butt kicked for this.

01:38:37.446 --> 01:38:39.616
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- Come on, Sam.

01:38:39.686 --> 01:38:42.416
- This is only gonna take a minute.
- Yeah.

01:38:51.326 --> 01:38:53.226
Bring it up.

01:38:55.606 --> 01:38:58.296
That's Dr. Garner, isn't it?

01:39:00.276 --> 01:39:02.606
Bring up '83.

01:39:19.626 --> 01:39:21.616
You shouldn't leave your door open.

01:39:23.666 --> 01:39:26.596
I didn't. 
There's something wrong with my lock.

01:39:26.666 --> 01:39:28.256
What do you want?

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:29.456
Tell me about Catherine.

01:39:32.376 --> 01:39:35.136
She told you, didn't she?

01:39:35.176 --> 01:39:37.666
What did she tell me?

01:39:40.516 --> 01:39:43.346
I slept with her once in school.

01:39:43.386 --> 01:39:46.576
I was just a kid. 
I was experimenting.

01:39:46.656 --> 01:39:50.216
It was just that one time.

01:39:50.286 --> 01:39:52.726
She developed a fixation on me.

01:39:53.196 --> 01:39:56.256
She styled her hair like mine, 
wore the same kind of clothes as I did.

01:39:56.326 --> 01:39:58.316
It scared me.

01:40:01.336 --> 01:40:04.266
Isn't that what she told you?

01:40:04.336 --> 01:40:06.676
She said it was you.

01:40:06.676 --> 01:40:08.666
You dressed like her. 
You dyed your hair blonde...

01:40:08.746 --> 01:40:10.736
I did dye my hair. 
It had nothing to do with her.

01:40:10.776 --> 01:40:13.546
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

01:40:13.576 --> 01:40:15.706
- I had him for two classes.
- You saw all the reports.

01:40:16.216 --> 01:40:17.516
Phil copied you. 
You never said anything!

01:40:17.586 --> 01:40:19.376
What am I supposed to say?

01:40:19.416 --> 01:40:22.686
"I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect"?

01:40:24.586 --> 01:40:29.526
I was embarrassed. 
It was the only time I'd been with a woman.

01:40:31.326 --> 01:40:33.386
She's really sick, you know.

01:40:33.466 --> 01:40:35.296
Do you know what she's doing?

01:40:35.336 --> 01:40:38.466
She knows I went to Berkeley. 
She knows I knew Noah.

01:40:38.536 --> 01:40:40.506
She makes up this story about me.

01:40:40.536 --> 01:40:43.236
She's handing you somebody 
who's obsessed with her.

01:40:43.276 --> 01:40:45.266
She didn't hand you to me. 
She doesn't know who you are.

01:40:45.346 --> 01:40:46.746
You told me about a Lisa Hoberman.

01:40:47.216 --> 01:40:50.376
She knows you'd find out who Lisa is. 
You're a good cop.

01:40:51.586 --> 01:40:53.556
She tell you casually?

01:40:53.616 --> 01:40:55.676
Make it seem irrelevant?

01:40:57.486 --> 01:40:59.476
Did she tell you in bed?

01:41:02.766 --> 01:41:05.256
That's what I'd do.

01:41:07.596 --> 01:41:09.536
Why'd you change your name?

01:41:09.566 --> 01:41:12.536
I got married. 
He called me "Beth."

01:41:12.606 --> 01:41:15.166
He was on staff at the clinic in Salinas.

01:41:15.246 --> 01:41:17.436
Didn't last long.

01:41:20.576 --> 01:41:23.446
Do you really think 
that I could kill someone?

01:41:23.516 --> 01:41:25.416
I never even met Johnny Boz!

01:41:25.456 --> 01:41:28.746
And what about Nilsen? 
What motive would I have to kill him?

01:41:29.226 --> 01:41:31.716
- You should get that lock fixed.
- God...

01:41:31.756 --> 01:41:35.456
She's evil! She's brilliant!

01:42:00.416 --> 01:42:02.756
Did I scare you?

01:42:02.756 --> 01:42:05.346
I wanted to surprise you.

01:42:05.426 --> 01:42:08.356
- What's wrong?
- I found Lisa Hoberman.

01:42:08.426 --> 01:42:10.416
Oh, you did? 
What's she doing?

01:42:13.666 --> 01:42:16.496
You're not going to tell me 
what she's doing.

01:42:16.566 --> 01:42:19.736
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.

01:42:20.206 --> 01:42:21.696
She said you got it backwards.

01:42:21.736 --> 01:42:24.576
She said you styled your hair like she did.

01:42:24.646 --> 01:42:26.666
And you believed her.

01:42:27.746 --> 01:42:33.546
I had to go to the campus police 
and file a report about her.

01:42:33.586 --> 01:42:37.446
- I suppose you still think I kill people too?
- No.

01:42:41.426 --> 01:42:43.326
Liar.

01:42:46.736 --> 01:42:50.566
- Who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide, San Francisco.

01:42:53.336 --> 01:42:55.436
Here we go.

01:42:55.506 --> 01:42:57.476
Kind of.

01:42:57.506 --> 01:43:00.036
There was a report about Lisa Hoberman, 
January, 1980.

01:43:00.076 --> 01:43:02.636
- But it's out of here.
- Who's got it?

01:43:03.716 --> 01:43:05.706
One of your guys. Nilsen.

01:43:06.086 --> 01:43:08.346
- You know him?
- Yeah.

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:10.586
Thanks a lot.

01:43:10.626 --> 01:43:13.556
Tell him to bring it back. 
He's had it a whole year.

01:43:14.096 --> 01:43:17.086
So Nilsen had a report on Beth. 
You don't know what was in it.

01:43:17.126 --> 01:43:19.616
- Catherine told me what was in it.
- If she's telling you the truth.

01:43:19.666 --> 01:43:21.426
Gus, don't you get it?

01:43:21.496 --> 01:43:23.496
If Beth killed Johnny Boz 
to frame Catherine...

01:43:23.536 --> 01:43:25.506
she wouldn't want anybody to know 
what happened in Berkeley!

01:43:25.536 --> 01:43:28.596
But Nilsen found out about it. 
That gives her the motive to kill him.

01:43:28.676 --> 01:43:31.646
How did she know Nilsen found out, 
if it happened?

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:34.106
He probably asked her!

01:43:34.316 --> 01:43:36.676
She'd have to be nuttier 
than a 20 pound fruitcake!

01:43:36.746 --> 01:43:39.616
She's not the one who hangs out 
with multiple murderers!

01:43:39.656 --> 01:43:42.316
- You're girlfriend is! 
- She's a writer! That's her job!

01:43:42.386 --> 01:43:45.486
I don't buy it. There must be somebody 
at Berkeley who knows what happened!

01:43:45.556 --> 01:43:47.496
I know what happened! 
Catherine told me!

01:43:47.556 --> 01:43:50.616
- Everything she says has checked out!
- You got tweety birds...

01:43:50.696 --> 01:43:52.726
fluttering around in your head!

01:43:52.796 --> 01:43:55.126
You think you can fuck like minks, 
raise rug rats...

01:43:55.296 --> 01:43:57.296
and live happily ever after?

01:43:57.336 --> 01:43:59.306
Oh, man!

01:44:11.386 --> 01:44:13.746
How'd you get in here?

01:44:13.786 --> 01:44:15.656
What's this?

01:44:15.726 --> 01:44:18.786
I decided to give you a second chance.

01:44:19.126 --> 01:44:23.186
- I missed you.
- I wasn't gone long enough.

01:44:23.366 --> 01:44:25.386
Did you miss me?

01:44:25.466 --> 01:44:26.396
No.

01:44:37.376 --> 01:44:41.206
Why don't you come over here 
and tell me no.

01:44:44.186 --> 01:44:46.376
- I've seen them before.
- Yeah?

01:44:46.416 --> 01:44:49.216
Well, you might not see them again.

01:44:49.386 --> 01:44:51.416
My book's nearly finished.

01:44:51.456 --> 01:44:53.686
My detective's almost dead.

01:44:53.756 --> 01:44:55.556
So I've got time for a last cigarette?

01:44:55.626 --> 01:44:56.786
Afterwards.

01:45:09.706 --> 01:45:12.476
I've got to do some research 
tomorrow morning.

01:45:12.546 --> 01:45:15.516
I'm good at research. 
I'll help you.

01:45:15.546 --> 01:45:17.416
No, thanks.

01:45:17.486 --> 01:45:19.576
What are you researching?

01:45:19.656 --> 01:45:21.206
Oh...

01:45:21.416 --> 01:45:23.756
a new ending to your book.

01:45:24.126 --> 01:45:27.116
Oh, really? 
What's the twist?

01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:31.156
The detective falls for the wrong girl.

01:45:31.196 --> 01:45:33.726
But he doesn't die.

01:45:35.606 --> 01:45:38.596
So what happens to him?

01:45:39.706 --> 01:45:43.196
They fuck like minks, raise rug rats...

01:45:43.406 --> 01:45:45.206
and live happily ever after.

01:45:46.716 --> 01:45:48.646
It won't sell.

01:45:49.746 --> 01:45:51.186
Why not?

01:45:52.816 --> 01:45:55.446
Somebody has to die.

01:45:58.126 --> 01:45:59.586
Why?

01:46:00.726 --> 01:46:03.756
Somebody always does.

01:46:20.716 --> 01:46:23.176
Morning. 
I'm looking for a Dr. Garner.

01:46:23.216 --> 01:46:26.746
She doesn't work here anymore. 
She's in San Francisco with the police.

01:46:26.786 --> 01:46:28.546
Actually, I'm looking for her husband.

01:46:28.586 --> 01:46:31.746
- He works here too, doesn't he?
- Dr. Joseph Garner?

01:46:31.786 --> 01:46:33.686
- She married?
- You know him?

01:46:33.726 --> 01:46:36.626
He died about five or six years ago.

01:46:36.666 --> 01:46:40.596
- How did he die?
- He was shot.

01:46:42.666 --> 01:46:44.726
Thank you.

01:46:46.506 --> 01:46:48.676
He was walking home from work.

01:46:48.736 --> 01:46:51.236
He only lived a couple of blocks 
from the clinic.

01:46:51.276 --> 01:46:52.706
Somebody just drove by and shot him.

01:46:52.776 --> 01:46:56.576
- What was the murder weapon?
- Revolver, .38. Unrecovered.

01:46:56.646 --> 01:46:59.276
- Watch yourself.
- Were there any suspects?

01:46:59.316 --> 01:47:02.716
No suspects, no motive. 
Unsolved.

01:47:02.756 --> 01:47:05.246
Was his wife ever a suspect?

01:47:06.726 --> 01:47:09.756
One of your guys was down here 
from Frisco a year ago.

01:47:10.096 --> 01:47:12.326
He was asking the same, exact thing.

01:47:12.536 --> 01:47:14.296
You mind telling me what's going on?

01:47:14.496 --> 01:47:17.126
Routine.

01:47:17.206 --> 01:47:19.176
That's exactly what he said.

01:47:19.176 --> 01:47:22.176
Now I got two of you guys 
telling me it's "routine."

01:47:22.176 --> 01:47:24.506
You remember what the other guy's name was?

01:47:25.646 --> 01:47:29.706
No. I can't really say that I do.

01:47:29.746 --> 01:47:32.516
Nilsen?

01:47:32.586 --> 01:47:34.516
Yeah. That was it.

01:47:36.786 --> 01:47:39.626
- So was she ever a suspect?
- No.

01:47:40.696 --> 01:47:42.186
There was some talk.

01:47:42.226 --> 01:47:44.256
But it never panned out.

01:47:44.326 --> 01:47:47.296
- What kind of talk?
- Girlfriend.

01:47:47.496 --> 01:47:49.596
He had a girlfriend?

01:47:49.666 --> 01:47:51.136
No.

01:47:52.776 --> 01:47:54.606
She did.

01:47:56.676 --> 01:48:00.136
But like I said, it never panned out.

01:48:02.216 --> 01:48:04.706
- Thank you.
- Hope that helped you out.

01:48:05.086 --> 01:48:09.216
Yes, you did. You sure did.

01:48:39.386 --> 01:48:40.646
I missed you.

01:48:42.826 --> 01:48:44.186
I finished my research.

01:48:44.256 --> 01:48:47.626
- I finished my book.
- So how does it end?

01:48:48.696 --> 01:48:50.666
I told you.

01:48:50.726 --> 01:48:52.666
She kills him.

01:48:55.336 --> 01:48:57.426
Good-bye, Nick.

01:48:59.176 --> 01:49:01.226
Good-bye?

01:49:01.306 --> 01:49:04.206
Yeah. I finished my book.

01:49:06.676 --> 01:49:08.736
Didn't you hear me?

01:49:08.816 --> 01:49:10.646
Your character's dead.

01:49:12.456 --> 01:49:14.076
Good-bye.

01:49:18.356 --> 01:49:20.416
What do you want, flowers?

01:49:20.456 --> 01:49:22.756
I'll send you an autographed copy.

01:49:24.726 --> 01:49:27.326
What is this, some kind of joke?

01:49:32.166 --> 01:49:33.366
You playing a game here?

01:49:34.476 --> 01:49:36.406
The games are over.

01:49:38.176 --> 01:49:39.646
You were right.

01:49:39.716 --> 01:49:44.146
It was the fuck of the century, shooter.

01:49:57.426 --> 01:49:58.826
I'll be right there.

01:50:26.426 --> 01:50:28.396
Catherine Tramell's roommate, 
freshman year? 

01:50:28.426 --> 01:50:32.386
I just got a call from her. 
She's in Oakland. Come on!

01:50:34.496 --> 01:50:36.486
I've been phoning people 
from her dorm all day. 

01:50:36.706 --> 01:50:38.326
She must've heard I was trying to reach her.

01:50:38.406 --> 01:50:42.396
Says she knows all about Catherine 
and Lisa Hoberman.

01:50:44.776 --> 01:50:46.336
You feeling okay?

01:50:48.376 --> 01:50:49.846
Here's something else.

01:50:50.186 --> 01:50:53.446
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist 
has an office on Van Ness.

01:50:53.516 --> 01:50:55.386
Guess who he shares space with?

01:50:55.416 --> 01:50:58.256
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

01:51:00.826 --> 01:51:04.386
What in the hell's the matter with you?

01:51:17.376 --> 01:51:20.406
I'll be in suite 405.

01:51:22.416 --> 01:51:24.746
- Where the hell you going?
- I'm going with you.

01:51:24.816 --> 01:51:26.756
You're on leave, Hoss.

01:51:26.756 --> 01:51:29.746
It ain't gonna take long.

01:53:52.326 --> 01:53:53.596
Freeze!

01:53:53.666 --> 01:53:55.296
What are you doing here?

01:53:55.366 --> 01:53:57.266
Put your fucking hands up!

01:53:57.336 --> 01:53:59.266
I got a message to meet Gus here.

01:53:59.336 --> 01:54:01.426
- Where is he?
- Don't you move!

01:54:01.506 --> 01:54:04.306
I know about your husband! 
You still like girls, Beth?

01:54:05.346 --> 01:54:08.646
- What?
- Take you hands out of your pocket!

01:54:08.716 --> 01:54:11.306
- Take them out!
- What's wrong with you?

01:54:11.386 --> 01:54:12.676
Take them out!

01:54:32.566 --> 01:54:34.536
I loved you.

01:54:50.786 --> 01:54:52.726
Oh, God!

01:55:15.716 --> 01:55:18.446
What made you think she had a gun?

01:55:20.216 --> 01:55:23.706
What was she doing here? 
What was Gus doing here?

01:55:27.396 --> 01:55:29.326
Lieutenant.

01:55:57.326 --> 01:55:58.656
One of ours.

01:56:01.456 --> 01:56:04.156
Jesus.

01:56:04.226 --> 01:56:06.566
We'll have to check Beth's apartment.

01:56:09.636 --> 01:56:11.366
Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

01:56:11.436 --> 01:56:14.236
In the bookcase, behind some books.

01:56:16.576 --> 01:56:19.666
Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.

01:56:19.716 --> 01:56:23.336
Lieutenant. 
You better come in here.

01:56:51.646 --> 01:56:54.446
I guess that's it.

01:57:09.596 --> 01:57:14.256
Definitely not. We feel all the evidence 
points to Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

01:57:14.296 --> 01:57:16.286
We checked. It's her size.

01:57:16.366 --> 01:57:18.526
She probably heard you on the stairway 
and dumped this stuff.

01:57:18.566 --> 01:57:20.336
There's no suite 405.

01:57:20.406 --> 01:57:22.336
Catherine Tramell's freshman roommate is dead.

01:57:22.406 --> 01:57:24.346
She died of leukemia two years ago.

01:57:24.406 --> 01:57:27.036
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- What about Salinas?

01:57:27.246 --> 01:57:30.076
Yeah, hold on. Jack!

01:57:31.616 --> 01:57:33.676
Did you check Nilsen's office 
for any files on Beth Garner?

01:57:33.756 --> 01:57:37.616
No police report from Berkeley. 
Nothing at all about Salinas.

01:57:37.656 --> 01:57:38.786
I'm back.

01:57:40.526 --> 01:57:41.786
Great.

01:57:42.456 --> 01:57:45.656
Ballistics says the .38 we found 
in her apartment was used on Nilsen.

01:57:45.726 --> 01:57:48.256
No registration. 
They're checking with Salinas.

01:57:48.296 --> 01:57:51.096
The ice pick was the same brand and model 
as the Boz weapon.

01:57:51.306 --> 01:57:53.536
Checked the tape machines 
at Dr. Garner's apartment and office...

01:57:53.606 --> 01:57:55.266
both here and the one on Van Ness.

01:57:55.306 --> 01:57:56.636
There's no message from Gus on any of them.

01:57:56.676 --> 01:57:58.646
The tape in her apartment was unused.

01:57:58.706 --> 01:58:01.476
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist 
says he thinks he remembers...

01:58:01.546 --> 01:58:04.636
Dr. Garner and Boz meeting 
at a Christmas party at his house.

01:58:04.716 --> 01:58:06.686
A year ago.

01:58:09.586 --> 01:58:12.616
You just can't tell about people, can you?

01:58:14.396 --> 01:58:18.696
Even the ones 
you think you know inside and out.

01:58:21.736 --> 01:58:24.496
Congratulations, Curran.

01:59:24.196 --> 01:59:26.096
I heard about what happened.

01:59:28.396 --> 01:59:31.366
On TV.

01:59:42.376 --> 01:59:46.176
I can't allow myself to care about you.

01:59:49.216 --> 01:59:52.156
I can't allow myself...

01:59:52.186 --> 01:59:54.716
to care.

01:59:57.766 --> 02:00:00.166
I don't want to do this.

02:00:00.236 --> 02:00:03.096
Please. 
I don't want to do this.

02:00:04.566 --> 02:00:07.406
I lose everybody.

02:00:07.476 --> 02:00:10.406
I don't want to lose you.

02:01:55.776 --> 02:01:57.746
What do we do now?

02:01:59.516 --> 02:02:02.816
Fuck like minks...

02:02:03.156 --> 02:02:06.556
raise rug rats and live happily ever after.

02:02:17.606 --> 02:02:19.156
I hate rug rats.

02:02:22.176 --> 02:02:25.146
Fuck like minks, forget the rug rats...

02:02:25.206 --> 02:02:28.176
and live happily ever after.
