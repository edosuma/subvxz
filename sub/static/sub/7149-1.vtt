03:14.320 --> 03:16.406
That was beautiful--

03:30.587 --> 03:32.422
Take it, Russ.

03:34.966 --> 03:37.635
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

03:37.802 --> 03:41.472
Sure, Russ. We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

03:41.639 --> 03:45.143
...by heading out into the country
in the old front-wheel drive sleigh...

03:45.310 --> 03:47.812
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

03:47.979 --> 03:51.107
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

03:51.274 --> 03:55.320
We're not driving all the way out here so
you can get one of those stupid ties...

03:55.486 --> 03:59.657
...with the Santa Clauses on it, are we?
No, I have one of those at home.

03:59.824 --> 04:04.370
What we're looking for today is the
Griswold family Christmas tree.

04:13.922 --> 04:17.007
What's the matter?
Some jackass is riding my tail.

04:19.719 --> 04:22.347
Slow down and let him pass.

04:33.691 --> 04:36.569
Clark! Don't provoke them.

04:37.654 --> 04:39.072
Hey, kids, look a deer.

04:59.217 --> 05:02.178
Clark, slow down!

05:02.345 --> 05:04.889
You wanna ride behind somebody
who does that?

05:05.056 --> 05:07.392
I'll pull around them
and leave them behind us.

05:07.558 --> 05:11.229
Burn some dust here. Eat my rubber.

05:11.396 --> 05:15.400
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber," and, "Eat my dust."

05:15.566 --> 05:17.193
Whatever, Russ. Whatever.

05:22.407 --> 05:25.410
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

05:28.579 --> 05:30.415
Okay. That's enough of that.

05:35.503 --> 05:38.089
Speaking of Christmas trees, kids,
can one of you tell me...

05:38.256 --> 05:40.800
...what the first tree displayed
at the White House was?

05:40.967 --> 05:43.136
Dad, they're back.

05:47.223 --> 05:51.269
Clark, stop it! I don't want
to spend the holidays dead.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.772
Honey, please!
I'll do the driving, okay?

05:55.023 --> 05:58.234
Will you just take it easy, Ellen?
I'm in complete control.

05:59.819 --> 06:01.237
I'll get around this egg timer.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.744
Dad. Dad.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.623
We're all right!
Thank God, we're all right!

06:20.649 --> 06:22.500
Clark, we're stuck
under a truck!

06:22.884 --> 06:26.637
Do you honestly think I don't know that?
Come on, you guys, don't fight.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.182
For chrissake,
I didn't do this on purpose!

06:32.852 --> 06:37.190
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

06:37.356 --> 06:40.276
And forgive my husband.
He knows not what he does.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.111
Amen!

06:43.821 --> 06:46.532
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

07:00.004 --> 07:01.714
Made pretty good time.

07:08.429 --> 07:12.558
Dad, didn't they invent Christmas tree
lots so people wouldn't have to drive...

07:12.725 --> 07:15.770
...all the way out to nowhere
and waste a whole Saturday?

07:15.937 --> 07:20.191
They invented them because people forgot
how to have an old-fashioned Christmas...

07:20.358 --> 07:22.735
...and are satisfied with scrawny,
overpriced trees...

07:22.902 --> 07:25.613
...that have no special meaning.
My toes are numb.

07:25.780 --> 07:29.700
Kids, this is what our forefathers did.
I can't feel my leg.

07:29.867 --> 07:33.621
They walked out into the woods, picked out
the tree and cut it with their hands.

07:33.788 --> 07:36.582
Mom, I can't feel my hips.
Clark.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.669
Yes, honey?
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

07:39.836 --> 07:42.380
That's all part of the
experience, honey.

07:44.215 --> 07:45.675
There it is.

08:04.402 --> 08:07.446
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

08:13.161 --> 08:17.957
Isn't it a little big?
It's not big, it's just full.

08:18.124 --> 08:23.129
Dad, that thing wouldn't fit in our yard.
It's not going in our yard, Russ.

08:23.296 --> 08:25.756
It's going in our living room.

08:30.136 --> 08:33.097
Look at it.
It really is beautiful, Clark.

08:33.264 --> 08:35.765
It's something else, huh, Russ?
Yeah, Dad.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.602
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?
She'll see it later, honey.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.188
Her eyes are frozen.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.942
Most enduring traditions of the season
are best enjoyed in the warm embrace...

08:45.109 --> 08:47.278
...of kith and kin.

08:48.613 --> 08:51.616
This tree is the symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

08:53.451 --> 08:55.620
Dad, did you bring a saw?

09:41.207 --> 09:44.669
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his living room ceiling.

09:56.514 --> 10:00.810
Hey, Griswold. Where do you think
you're gonna put a tree that big?

10:02.228 --> 10:04.355
Bend over and I'll show you.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.400
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.236
I wasn't talking to you.

10:24.041 --> 10:28.254
Clark, do you think there's
enough room for the angel?

10:29.130 --> 10:32.216
Oh, sure, honey. I have
a little more trimming to do...

10:32.383 --> 10:34.760
...but that won't be a problem.
Ready?

10:35.219 --> 10:38.556
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

10:46.731 --> 10:48.941
There's a lot of sap in here.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.112
It looks great. A little full.
A lot of sap.

11:15.551 --> 11:18.354
Did I tell you I talked
to my mother today?

11:18.380 --> 11:19.080
And?

11:19.221 --> 11:22.767
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas too.

11:23.142 --> 11:27.897
It's not too late to change our plans.
No, no, that's great. That's great.

11:28.773 --> 11:30.816
You're forgetting how difficult
it's gonna be...

11:30.983 --> 11:33.152
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

11:33.319 --> 11:36.155
Honey, they're family. They're
not strangers off the street.

11:36.322 --> 11:37.661
All they do is argue.

11:37.687 --> 11:40.810
Christmas is about
resolving differences...

11:40.951 --> 11:43.204
...and seeing through the problems
of family life.

11:43.371 --> 11:47.792
Yeah. And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

11:47.958 --> 11:51.962
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip.

11:52.129 --> 11:55.549
And then they don't speak to each other--
Your mother waxes her upper lip?

11:55.716 --> 11:59.970
She has for years.
It doesn't show.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.539
I don't know, Sparky.
I have this feeling--

12:02.565 --> 12:03.165
Ellen.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.976
I want to have Christmas
here in our house.

12:06.143 --> 12:10.356
It means a lot to me. All my life I've
wanted to have a big family Christmas.

12:10.523 --> 12:12.400
I know.

12:14.527 --> 12:18.823
It's just that I know how you build
things up in your mind, Sparky.

12:19.657 --> 12:24.203
You set standards that no family
event can ever live up to.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.831
When have I ever done that?

12:29.834 --> 12:36.215
Parties. Weddings. Anniversaries.
Good night, honey.

12:36.382 --> 12:40.511
Funerals. Holidays.
Oh, great.

12:40.678 --> 12:43.764
Vacations. Graduations.

13:06.370 --> 13:09.290
You should be looking at a fat
Christmas bonus this year, huh?

13:09.457 --> 13:13.210
Word is you're an excellent choice to be
named Food Additive Designer of the Year.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.046
I'm not kidding.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.382
What's that new thing you got
at Food and Drug?

13:18.549 --> 13:22.219
Oh, the crunch enhancer? Yeah, it's
a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.389
It's semipermeable, not osmatic.
It coats and seals the flake...

13:25.556 --> 13:28.058
...prevents the milk from penetrating it.
Yeah.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.519
It's a beautiful product.
I like it, yeah.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.022
The question is,
what will you do with that bonus?

13:33.189 --> 13:36.567
Gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.
Me? Heck, no.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.736
Take a look at this.

13:43.157 --> 13:45.242
I hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

13:45.409 --> 13:48.537
Oh, my God, you're
putting in a pool.

13:58.047 --> 14:01.342
I went ahead and I put a $7500
deposit down on it.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.427
You're the last true family man.

14:05.346 --> 14:08.891
Mark.
Clark.

14:09.934 --> 14:11.352
That's Bill, sir.

14:11.519 --> 14:14.230
Were you working on that
non-nutritive cereal varnish?

14:14.688 --> 14:15.239
Yes, sir.

14:15.265 --> 14:17.466
I've got to give a
speech to a trade group.

14:17.608 --> 14:22.196
I'd like to mention it. Write a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.156
My pleasure.
Layman's terms.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.992
None of that inside bullshit jargon
nobody understands.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.828
Yes, sir.

14:32.665 --> 14:36.085
Oh, Mr. Shirley. We got
your Christmas card the other day...

14:36.252 --> 14:39.296
...and my family and I are very
flattered that you remembered us.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.633
Corporate cards.

14:46.178 --> 14:49.473
Don't forget that report, Bill.
Yes, sir. Thank you. Merry Christmas.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.976
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

14:52.142 --> 14:57.481
Kiss my ass. Kiss his ass.
Kiss your ass. Happy Hanukkah.

15:23.132 --> 15:25.593
Can I show you something?

15:31.974 --> 15:37.479
I was just smelling-- Smiling.
I was just blouse-- Browsing.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.525
For your wife or your girlfriend?

15:42.860 --> 15:45.279
What? What happened?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.704
I guess it wouldn't be any--

15:54.705 --> 15:57.541
Wouldn't be the Christmas shopping
season if stores were less hooter--

15:57.708 --> 16:00.377
Hotter than they are.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.130
It is warm in here.
You have your coat on.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.091
Yes. Oh, do I? How did that happen?
Because it's cold out.

16:06.592 --> 16:12.014
Yes. Yes. It is. It's a bit
nipply out. I mean, nippy out.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.600
What did I say, nipple?

16:14.892 --> 16:18.896
There is a nip in the air though.
Can I take something out for you?

16:28.656 --> 16:33.369
I was just.... I was just looking
at something for my wife.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.580
God rest her soul.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

16:36.789 --> 16:42.461
Oh, no, no, she's not dead.
We're just divorced. She's history.

16:42.628 --> 16:46.465
Obviously she doesn't wear underwear. And
there are plenty of shopping days left...

16:46.632 --> 16:51.303
...until adultery-- Adulthood.
Which is to say Christmas, as in Yule.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.750
Yule log. Not a log,
I don't have a log.

16:53.776 --> 16:56.333
But, I mean, you know,
just if I had a log...

16:56.475 --> 17:01.730
...not in the sense that you think
I said I did. Good golly.

17:02.773 --> 17:04.775
'Tis the season to be merry.

17:04.942 --> 17:07.277
Well, that's my name.
No shit.

17:15.786 --> 17:20.499
What do these do?
Do they clip on here? Down there?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.085
Would you like this one?
Sure.

17:23.377 --> 17:27.131
These are cut really high on the hip.
Look, I'm wearing something similar.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.174
See? You can't see the line.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.844
You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
No.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.637
No.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.851
<i>That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.</i>

17:39.727 --> 17:43.647
<i>Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...</i>

17:43.814 --> 17:46.316
<i>...an angel gets his wings.</i>

18:20.017 --> 18:23.020
Folks! Folks! Folks! Merry Christmas.

18:25.522 --> 18:29.526
Hey! How you doing, son?
Fine.

18:29.818 --> 18:33.197
There he is! Oh, my boy.

18:33.363 --> 18:37.201
Look at how big you've gotten.
Merry Christmas.

18:37.576 --> 18:39.161
Mom.
Sweetheart.

18:39.328 --> 18:43.499
Oh, knock on the door.
Lift up the ladder.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.959
Listen. Doesn't Nora look old?
You promised.

18:46.126 --> 18:49.379
Of course I do.
They took a pint of fluid out of my back.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.715
Do you see this mole?
This mole on my neck?

18:51.882 --> 18:53.383
Think it's changing color?
No.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.721
You keep touching it, it's getting redder.
I got hemorrhoids. Can you believe that?

18:57.888 --> 18:59.932
Oh, Mother.
Isn't that terrible?

19:00.098 --> 19:02.601
You're not getting the garage space.
After what you did--

19:02.768 --> 19:04.645
I'm doing the parking.
Russ, you want to help?

19:04.853 --> 19:07.856
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy, Mom.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.360
Sweetheart. Your grandma Nora's
got a real painful burr on my heel.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.862
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a whole quarter.

19:14.029 --> 19:16.782
A quarter. A quarter.
I'll give Audrey a quarter too.

19:16.949 --> 19:20.327
I'm gonna put my car in the garage!
He damaged my car, you believe that?

19:20.494 --> 19:21.578
I'll park the cars.

19:22.913 --> 19:25.666
This is what Christmas is all about.

19:26.124 --> 19:29.795
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage...

19:29.962 --> 19:33.423
...and yeah, I'll be
outside for the season.

19:36.635 --> 19:39.012
We're gonna have the
best-looking house in town.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.683
I've always wanted to do this.
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.769
I'm sure it's a lot of work too,
but if I'm out in the cold...

19:45.936 --> 19:49.106
...and I'm committed to decorating
the house, I'm gonna do it right...

19:49.273 --> 19:51.733
...and I'm gonna do it big.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.611
You want something you can
be proud of, don't you?

19:54.778 --> 19:57.447
Yeah, I guess so.
Sure you do.

19:58.448 --> 20:04.454
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?
When was the last time I overdid anything?

20:07.583 --> 20:08.584
Come on, unravel these.

20:10.794 --> 20:14.423
You have to check every bulb.
Got a little knot here. You work on that.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.511
I'll get the other box.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.985
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.
I'm sure he'll fall.

20:35.152 --> 20:37.946
But I don't think we're lucky enough
to have him break his neck.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.160
Let's go.

21:10.020 --> 21:14.816
<i>Boy, these gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with that giant nutcracker float.</i>

21:14.983 --> 21:19.196
<i>At this point I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.</i>

21:19.363 --> 21:23.533
<i>But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.</i>

21:23.700 --> 21:27.913
<i>Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.
These look like giant nuts to me.</i>

21:28.080 --> 21:31.625
<i>Yeah, I'm reminded of a couple years
ago, the winds were so high here...</i>

21:31.792 --> 21:34.211
<i>...we almost lost Santa's reindeer.</i>

21:34.378 --> 21:39.216
<i>Rudolph's red nose took out a third
floor window at Marshall Field's.</i>

21:39.383 --> 21:43.553
<i>They better keep their eyes out on
their nuts before someone gets hurt.</i>

22:43.321 --> 22:46.616
Would it be indecent to ask
the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

22:46.783 --> 22:48.285
Audrey.

22:48.452 --> 22:51.121
Well, can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

22:51.288 --> 22:55.208
Alex called this morning. Grandpa Clark
told him I couldn't come to the phone...

22:55.375 --> 22:59.713
...because I was going to the bathroom.
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.049
Everybody?
Do you sleep with your brother?

23:02.215 --> 23:04.634
Do you know how sick and twisted
that is, Mom?

23:04.926 --> 23:09.181
Well, I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

23:09.765 --> 23:12.017
I have nightmares about
what he does in his bed...

23:12.184 --> 23:14.061
...when I'm not lying
right next to him.

23:14.269 --> 23:20.358
Well, I don't know what to say except
it's Christmas and we're all in misery.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.987
Ellen, are you smoking again?

23:24.154 --> 23:26.531
No!

23:36.792 --> 23:39.169
Hey, Dad, where do you want
these reindeer?

23:39.586 --> 23:42.255
Just put them down there
on the lawn, Russ.

23:44.174 --> 23:46.009
I can't find the Santa Claus.

23:47.385 --> 23:51.014
It's in the basement.
We'll get it later.

24:46.236 --> 24:52.617
Clark. Dinner's ready.
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.929
Obviously something
had to break the window!

25:13.096 --> 25:16.099
Something had to hit the stereo!

25:24.941 --> 25:30.906
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?
I don't know, Margo.

25:38.121 --> 25:41.124
You want to hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

25:41.291 --> 25:45.921
Two hundred and fifty strands of light,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

25:46.087 --> 25:50.884
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.180
Twenty-five thousand.
Well, I hope nobody I know drives by...

25:55.347 --> 25:59.226
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at the house in my pajamas.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.145
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.147
Fire it up, Dad!

26:05.315 --> 26:09.819
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.741
Drum roll, please.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.662
Drum roll.

26:50.568 --> 26:55.031
Beautiful, Clark.
Talk about pissing your money away.

26:55.991 --> 27:00.412
I hope you kids see what a silly
waste of resources this was.

27:00.578 --> 27:04.666
He worked really hard, Grandma.
So do washing machines.

27:09.713 --> 27:11.881
Let's get in where it's warm.

27:12.048 --> 27:17.846
Clark, baby, I can picture it in my mind.
And it's breathtaking.

27:20.223 --> 27:23.601
Thanks, Mom.
It's probably a bad bulb, son.

27:23.768 --> 27:27.063
You know, if one goes out,
the whole thing doesn't work.

27:27.230 --> 27:30.567
Now, if I were you
I'd personally check each one.

27:30.734 --> 27:33.737
I did that, Dad. I can't--
Now, look, if you need any help...

27:33.903 --> 27:38.199
...give me a holler. I'll be upstairs, asleep.
Thanks.

27:38.366 --> 27:43.663
Sorry, Daddy. It looks good
even if they're not lit.

27:44.414 --> 27:45.749
Thank you, sweetheart.

27:52.422 --> 27:57.260
Well, Dad, it was a good try.
Thanks, Russ.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.220
Russ.
Yeah?

27:59.387 --> 28:05.435
We checked every bulb, didn't we?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm sure of it.

28:06.102 --> 28:10.231
I thought so. Well, maybe we ought
to go up there and just get--

28:11.358 --> 28:17.364
Jeez! Look at the time. I gotta get
to bed. Brush my teeth. Feed the hog.

28:17.530 --> 28:21.826
I've still got some homework to do.
Do the laundry. Wash the car.

28:21.993 --> 28:24.746
I've still got those bills to pay....

28:24.913 --> 28:29.459
Clark, don't stay up too late.

28:51.189 --> 28:54.818
Get off me, you little fungus.

30:54.771 --> 30:57.941
Where the hell is that
cold coming from?

31:19.295 --> 31:20.296
Hello?

31:20.463 --> 31:23.132
I need to get a few more--
Pay by check.

31:23.299 --> 31:27.679
I will. Not a card?
No. If they return it, then it's a hassle....

31:27.845 --> 31:30.098
Russ!

31:33.935 --> 31:37.230
Help!
Daddy, is Clark coming?

31:37.397 --> 31:39.440
How would I know?
Is he in the house?

31:39.607 --> 31:42.443
If he isn't farting around
with his lights, he must be inside.

31:42.610 --> 31:45.363
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

31:45.530 --> 31:51.494
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pills.

32:22.025 --> 32:24.736
Ellen! Hey! Ellen!

35:52.527 --> 35:57.490
I want to take off these clothes, sit
with a glass of wine and kiss your body.

35:57.657 --> 35:59.909
After you shower, of course.
Of course.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.803
Sparky?
Yes, honey.

36:28.312 --> 36:31.941
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

36:32.108 --> 36:35.611
No. I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

36:35.987 --> 36:40.074
In the meantime, I can light the Santa and
the reindeer and the Merry Christmas sign.

36:40.950 --> 36:43.870
That should look good. Ready?

36:44.036 --> 36:49.292
You want me to do the drum roll thing?
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

36:55.464 --> 36:57.800
I don't understand it.

36:58.759 --> 37:02.305
The house lights don't work,
the flood lights don't work.

37:04.307 --> 37:05.975
Is it plugged in?

37:06.142 --> 37:08.769
Do you honestly think I would check
thousands of lights...

37:08.936 --> 37:11.188
...if the extension
cord wasn't plugged in?

37:13.983 --> 37:16.777
You used more than one
cord, didn't you?

37:18.821 --> 37:23.409
Maybe the kids have been fooling
around with it. I'll check in back.

37:43.638 --> 37:45.640
Clark!

37:46.432 --> 37:48.851
Todd! What's that light?!

37:50.019 --> 37:51.395
Clark!

37:52.313 --> 37:54.023
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.375
I can't see.

38:12.541 --> 38:15.378
No, no, no--
Oh, my God--

38:30.267 --> 38:32.687
This ought to do it.

38:44.865 --> 38:46.200
Ellen, I fixed it!

38:48.577 --> 38:49.912
Oh, God!

38:50.079 --> 38:53.541
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

39:01.966 --> 39:04.802
Get a towel.
Okay!

39:07.555 --> 39:10.808
Wait a minute. I don't believe this!
What's all the yelling about?

39:11.225 --> 39:14.729
What?! But--
What's going on here?

39:16.856 --> 39:18.983
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

39:20.943 --> 39:23.988
What's he doing, Clark?
I haven't the foggiest.

39:24.155 --> 39:26.282
What?

39:26.449 --> 39:31.120
What the hell?
What is wrong with this?

39:32.621 --> 39:35.624
Damn it! Damn it!

39:38.627 --> 39:41.714
You goddamn light!

39:59.648 --> 40:00.941
Go! Go! Do it!

40:13.120 --> 40:15.456
Dad, it's beautiful!

40:31.055 --> 40:32.681
Oh, my carpet!

40:41.649 --> 40:46.695
Oh, Clark, it's so lovely.
Mom.

40:47.446 --> 40:51.784
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

40:53.410 --> 40:58.124
It's a beaut, Clark. It's a beaut.
Dad, Dad, Dad.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.085
You taught me everything
I know about exterior illumination.

41:01.252 --> 41:04.004
Thank you, thank you.

41:04.171 --> 41:07.133
Russ. Audrey.

41:09.885 --> 41:13.055
Dear, dear Francis.

41:15.015 --> 41:18.185
I hope this adds to your enjoyment
of the holidays.

41:18.352 --> 41:21.730
It's just wonderful.
Yeah.

41:22.606 --> 41:26.110
Arthur. Art.

41:27.403 --> 41:28.654
Dad.

41:28.821 --> 41:33.325
Thanks for being here.
The little lights are not twinkling.

41:33.492 --> 41:36.579
I know, Art, and
thanks for noticing.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.918
The house sure does
look swell, Clark.

41:43.252 --> 41:49.258
Thanks, Eddie. I hope it enhances
your holiday spirit. Dear Cathrine.

41:49.592 --> 41:52.052
Eddie?

41:52.428 --> 41:57.433
Oh, the house is gorgeous, Clark.
Eddie?

41:57.600 --> 42:00.895
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

42:01.061 --> 42:04.607
Kids, come on out here and see what
Uncle Clark's done to the house.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.275
Eddie?

42:13.282 --> 42:14.992
Eddie?

42:16.952 --> 42:20.956
Yeah. If you don't remember,
this here is Rocky.

42:21.332 --> 42:24.585
You got a kiss for me?
Better take a rain check on that, Art.

42:24.752 --> 42:27.129
He's got a lip fungus
they ain't identified yet.

42:30.299 --> 42:34.470
You remember Ruby Sue?
Oh, yeah.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.597
Oh, my gosh!

42:38.474 --> 42:41.602
Her eyes aren't crossed anymore.
That's something, ain't it?

42:41.769 --> 42:46.357
Falls in a well, eyes go crossed. She gets
kicked by a mule, they go back to normal.

42:46.523 --> 42:48.984
I don't know.

42:51.153 --> 42:54.698
And this here's our pride and joy.
Snots.

42:55.783 --> 42:56.867
Pretty name, Ed.

42:57.034 --> 42:59.954
We named him that because he's
got this sinus condition.

43:00.788 --> 43:04.124
Snots, you roll over and let
Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

43:06.293 --> 43:10.339
You ain't never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

43:10.506 --> 43:11.882
That's okay, Eddie.

43:12.424 --> 43:15.010
That's something, ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

43:15.177 --> 43:17.388
...and he'll love you
till the day you die.

43:17.554 --> 43:20.516
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

43:20.683 --> 43:24.561
We were gonna call, but Eddie
wanted to make it a surprise.

43:24.728 --> 43:28.524
Yeah. You surprised?
Surprised, Eddie?

43:28.691 --> 43:33.362
If I woke up with my head sewn to the
carpet, I wouldn't be more surprised.

43:35.698 --> 43:38.742
We have plenty of room.

43:39.702 --> 43:43.372
We have plenty of towels.
We have plenty of everything.

43:44.873 --> 43:49.336
We're pretty well set up here
in the RV. It's a little tight...

43:49.503 --> 43:53.048
...but we didn't come to impose.
Hell, there's plenty of room.

43:53.215 --> 43:55.926
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

43:56.093 --> 43:59.805
Cathrine and I, we're pretty
comfy in there, you know.

43:59.972 --> 44:03.392
But maybe you wouldn't mind
the youngsters shacking up with you.

44:03.559 --> 44:08.772
After that long drive, we could
use a little private time together.

44:08.939 --> 44:13.777
Why don't you run and get the kids' things?
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

44:13.944 --> 44:16.572
Come on. I wanna show you the home.

44:16.739 --> 44:19.742
Audrey, help me get some
hot chocolate. It's cold.

44:53.901 --> 44:58.113
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.
Is it real?

44:58.280 --> 45:00.991
Yeah. Yeah, I dug it out
of the ground myself.

45:01.158 --> 45:04.787
Is that a fact?
Hey, get out of there. Snots! Yo!

45:04.953 --> 45:08.290
Don't worry about it, Clark. A little
tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

45:08.457 --> 45:11.168
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

45:11.335 --> 45:16.465
Boy, when he lifted his leg
the next morning....

45:16.632 --> 45:20.177
If he drinks the water, the tree's
gonna dry up. Come on, out of there.

45:20.344 --> 45:22.429
Snots.
Out, out, out.

45:22.596 --> 45:24.473
Get out of there.
Get in the kitchen now.

45:24.640 --> 45:27.810
Get in the kitchen there and get
you something to eat. Go on.

45:27.976 --> 45:33.649
He's cute, ain't he? Problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

45:33.816 --> 45:38.821
If the mood catches him right, he'll
grab your leg and just go to town.

45:38.987 --> 45:43.575
Don't want him around if you're wearing
short pants, if you know what I mean.

45:44.159 --> 45:50.165
A word of warning, though. If he does lay
into you, it's best to just let him finish.

45:51.333 --> 45:55.587
I can't believe you're actually standing
here in my living room, Eddie.

45:55.754 --> 46:00.008
Never thought the day would come.
Yeah, I'm excited about it too.

46:00.175 --> 46:03.887
It's a crying shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

46:06.640 --> 46:10.936
I'll get that. Don't worry about it.
Let me get it.

46:13.355 --> 46:18.318
Yeah, I got the daughter in the clinic,
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

46:18.485 --> 46:23.031
And the older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

46:23.198 --> 46:24.700
College?
Carnival.

46:25.951 --> 46:28.370
You gotta be proud.
Oh, yeah.

46:28.537 --> 46:32.583
Yeah, last season he was a pixie-dust
spreader on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

46:32.749 --> 46:34.543
He thinks maybe next year...

46:34.710 --> 46:37.921
...he'll be guessing people's weight
or barking for the Yak Woman.

46:40.132 --> 46:41.758
You ever see her?
No.

46:41.925 --> 46:45.429
She's got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

46:45.596 --> 46:49.183
Yeah, she's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.
And a hell of a good cook.

46:49.349 --> 46:51.894
Can I refill your eggnog?
Get you something to eat?

46:52.269 --> 46:54.563
Drive you out to nowhere
and leave you for dead?

46:54.730 --> 46:58.859
No, I'm doing just fine, Clark.
Just glad to be here.

46:59.026 --> 47:03.864
Yeah. So when did you get
the tenement on wheels?

47:04.031 --> 47:07.117
Oh, that there? That's an RV.

47:07.284 --> 47:11.371
Yeah, yeah. I borrowed it off a
buddy of mine. He took my house...

47:11.538 --> 47:15.792
...I took the RV. It's a
good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

47:15.959 --> 47:18.253
Yeah. Looks so nice parked
in the driveway.

47:18.420 --> 47:22.508
Yeah, it sure does. But don't
you go falling in love with it now.

47:22.674 --> 47:25.886
Because we're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

47:35.479 --> 47:38.899
Well, get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures.

47:39.066 --> 47:41.610
Oh, retooling.
That's a great excuse.

47:43.278 --> 47:46.907
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

47:48.617 --> 47:52.162
Mr. Shirley, merry Christmas.
Who's that?

47:53.163 --> 47:55.624
It's me, Clark Griswold.
What do you want?

47:57.584 --> 48:01.838
My wife and I came up with a little
something special. It's a gift.

48:03.006 --> 48:06.635
Put it over there with the others,
greaseball.

48:16.186 --> 48:20.649
By the way, I hope my report
helped out at the trade show.

48:25.612 --> 48:28.240
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

48:28.407 --> 48:32.160
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in
the middle of an important call.

48:32.661 --> 48:35.831
Get me somebody. Anybody.

48:36.999 --> 48:38.375
And get me somebody while I wait.

48:51.722 --> 48:57.102
This is a new silicon-based kitchen
lubricant my company's been working on.

48:57.269 --> 49:01.023
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than any cooking oil.

49:01.189 --> 49:03.525
We're gonna fly down
the hill with this stuff.

49:03.942 --> 49:07.362
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?
Not that I know of, Russ.

49:10.157 --> 49:13.535
Well, don't go putting none of
that stuff on my sled, Clark.

49:13.702 --> 49:16.788
You know that metal plate in my head?
How could I forget?

49:16.955 --> 49:20.751
I had to have it replaced because every
time Cathrine revved up the microwave...

49:20.917 --> 49:24.046
...I'd piss my pants and forget
who I was for a half-hour or so.

49:24.212 --> 49:29.593
Over at the V.A. they had to replace it with
a plastic one and it ain't as strong, so....

49:29.760 --> 49:33.013
I don't know if I ought to go down
no hill with nothing between...

49:33.180 --> 49:36.391
...the ground and my brain
but a piece of government plastic.

49:38.226 --> 49:44.399
You really think it matters, Eddie?
The plate runs underneath my part here.

49:44.983 --> 49:47.402
Over here it's, you know, nothing.

49:47.569 --> 49:52.366
But here, if this gets dented, then
my hair just ain't gonna look right.

49:55.077 --> 50:00.207
Yeah, I know the feeling. I better
try this first, see how it works.

50:00.374 --> 50:03.585
Well, you be careful there.
There's nothing to worry about, Eddie.

50:04.461 --> 50:08.757
Going for a new amateur recreational
saucer-sled land-speed record:

50:09.174 --> 50:11.760
Clark W. Griswold Jr.!

50:12.344 --> 50:16.765
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

50:18.767 --> 50:23.605
Later, dudes. Let her rip. Hang 10.

50:24.564 --> 50:27.109
Oh, shit!

50:40.038 --> 50:43.291
This is great! It's great!
It's great! I'm dead!

51:02.769 --> 51:04.187
Look out!

51:29.004 --> 51:30.589
Bingo.

51:42.142 --> 51:47.022
Clark? You staying late?
Oh, hi, Bill. Yeah.

51:47.189 --> 51:50.984
Just finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

51:51.151 --> 51:54.446
Well, have a really Merry Christmas.

51:55.363 --> 51:56.740
You too.

51:59.201 --> 52:02.370
Are you okay?
Yeah.

52:04.039 --> 52:06.583
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

52:06.750 --> 52:09.044
I just talked to my son.

52:09.211 --> 52:12.380
Company messenger brought something
to the house. I guess that's it.

52:12.547 --> 52:17.010
Nothing like waiting till the
last minute, huh? Did you get yours?

52:19.221 --> 52:21.556
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it's on its way.

52:21.932 --> 52:26.186
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

52:26.353 --> 52:31.399
Don't sweat it. It'll come. Merry Christmas.
Same to you.

53:47.726 --> 53:48.768
<i>Me?</i>

54:42.155 --> 54:44.366
Santy Claus!

54:44.532 --> 54:46.868
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

54:47.035 --> 54:49.037
What?

54:51.790 --> 54:54.042
You scared me.

54:55.377 --> 54:57.253
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

55:00.882 --> 55:03.468
I wish I was.

55:04.094 --> 55:06.930
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

55:08.181 --> 55:10.392
Rocky bit my thumb.
What?

55:10.558 --> 55:13.353
Him's nervous because
Christmas is almost here.

55:14.562 --> 55:17.774
Nervous or excited?
Shitting bricks.

55:19.234 --> 55:23.071
You shouldn't use that word.
Sorry. Shitting rocks.

55:24.030 --> 55:25.907
I see. Good.

55:26.074 --> 55:29.995
Him's nervous because he don't
know if he's getting nothing.

55:32.580 --> 55:35.709
I don't think he should be nervous
and you shouldn't be either.

55:35.875 --> 55:38.586
Because if you're
good, Santa knows it.

55:39.421 --> 55:43.758
If you believe in him and you believe
in your mom and you believe in your....

55:43.925 --> 55:46.261
Your dad.

55:46.428 --> 55:50.932
If you've been good all year round, Santa
Claus is gonna bring you something.

55:51.725 --> 55:55.103
Sometimes I think all that
Santa crap is just bull.

55:55.270 --> 55:58.648
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

55:58.815 --> 56:01.484
We didn't do nothing wrong
and we still got the shaft.

56:02.360 --> 56:06.322
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

56:07.115 --> 56:09.576
And in the next couple of days...

56:09.743 --> 56:11.911
...somehow I'm gonna
prove it to you.

56:13.371 --> 56:16.458
You know, every year he comes
to our house. I've seen him.

56:17.792 --> 56:21.504
That's true?
Cross my heart.

56:24.507 --> 56:27.886
So it's good you came to stay with us.
I love it here.

56:28.053 --> 56:30.764
You don't gotta put on your coat
to go to the bathroom.

56:30.930 --> 56:33.433
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

56:37.145 --> 56:40.065
I think you'd better
go back to bed now.

56:41.733 --> 56:44.778
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

56:47.155 --> 56:50.241
Oh, I was just looking
for something.

56:52.911 --> 56:57.540
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

56:57.707 --> 56:59.751
Nope. How come?

56:59.918 --> 57:02.253
Oh, just wondering.

57:07.175 --> 57:09.677
Now you get back to bed. Come on.

57:16.142 --> 57:18.686
Uncle Clark, are you sure
you ain't Santy Claus?

57:20.313 --> 57:22.107
I'm sure.

57:26.444 --> 57:29.614
I can't even afford to be an elf.

57:39.040 --> 57:43.545
Two containers of K rations!
Two containers of K rations!

57:43.711 --> 57:47.215
Then I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears.

57:47.382 --> 57:49.342
Oh, bullshit!

57:58.935 --> 58:03.565
Aren't you having any breakfast?
I'm not in the mood.

58:04.065 --> 58:06.568
What are you looking at?

58:07.277 --> 58:10.446
Oh, the silent majesty
of a winter's morn.

58:10.613 --> 58:13.783
The clean, cool chill
of the holiday air.

58:13.950 --> 58:17.620
And an asshole in his bathrobe emptying
a chemical toilet into my sewer.

58:22.917 --> 58:25.753
Shitter was full!
Yeah.

58:25.920 --> 58:28.673
Have you checked our shitters, honey?
Clark, please.

58:28.840 --> 58:31.259
He doesn't know any better.
It's illegal.

58:31.426 --> 58:35.597
It's a storm sewer. If it fills with gas, I pity
the person who lights a match near it.

58:59.287 --> 59:03.958
Merry Christmas. Shitter was full.

59:17.889 --> 59:21.768
<i>I have a terrible suspicion Cathrine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.</i>

59:22.310 --> 59:27.690
Rocky said something about Eddie telling
him Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

59:28.524 --> 59:32.111
Yeah. Ruby Sue said something
like that last night.

59:32.278 --> 59:36.032
How can they have nothing for the kids?
He's been out of work for seven years.

59:36.199 --> 59:38.326
In seven years he
couldn't find a job?

59:38.493 --> 59:42.622
Cathrine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

59:46.292 --> 59:51.673
So how's the live-bait business, Eddie?
Well, I can't complain. How you doing?

59:51.839 --> 59:53.633
Not that good, actually.

59:53.800 --> 59:57.136
Your company kill off all them
people over in India not long ago?

59:57.303 --> 01:00:03.017
No. We missed out on that one. You're
pretty set so far as shopping goes?

01:00:03.184 --> 01:00:08.439
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark. The truth
is, things ain't going too good at all.

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:13.903
You know, I told you I borrowed the RV
from my neighbor? Nope. It's mine.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:19.909
We live in it. I had to sell off
the house, the barn, the 10 acres.

01:00:20.076 --> 01:00:26.499
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.377
If only I had back the money
that me and Cathrine...

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:34.007
...sent that TV preacher that was
screwing the hockey players.

01:00:34.173 --> 01:00:36.050
What about the kids?

01:00:36.217 --> 01:00:39.887
His kids can fend for themselves.
No, your kids.

01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:43.558
Oh, well, that's the bitch of it.
See, I don't know what to do.

01:00:43.725 --> 01:00:48.938
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Gurnee.

01:00:49.772 --> 01:00:51.649
Eddie....

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:56.112
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

01:00:56.279 --> 01:00:59.741
Clark, I couldn't do that.
No, no, we insist.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:02.410
Oh, no. I'm not one
for charity, now.

01:01:02.577 --> 01:01:06.080
Oh, I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:11.586
I don't know about that.
Now, come on.

01:01:11.753 --> 01:01:15.548
If you don't tell me what they want,
I'll go out and get it on my own.

01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:21.596
Oh, boy.
This is a surprise, Clark.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:27.977
This is just a real nice surprise.
Just a real nice surprise.

01:01:33.066 --> 01:01:37.111
Here's a little list. Alphabetical,
starting with Cathrine.

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:41.240
And if it wouldn't be too much, I'd
like to get something for you, Clark.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:44.285
Something really nice.

01:02:01.219 --> 01:02:05.223
Is your house on fire, Clark?
No, Bethany. Those are Christmas lights.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:08.768
Don't throw me down, Clark.
I'll try not to, Aunt Bethany.

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:12.355
Is this the airport, Clark?
We're here!

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:16.317
Hey, Gris, me and Bethany figured
out the perfect gift for you.

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:19.153
Oh, Uncle Lewis, you didn't
have to buy me anything.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.323
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:26.786
Oh, that was fun.
I love riding in cars.

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:30.665
When did you move to Florida?

01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:35.420
Ellen, are you still dating Clark?

01:02:36.879 --> 01:02:41.175
Oh, Aunt Bethany, you know
you shouldn't have done that.

01:02:41.342 --> 01:02:44.011
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.849
Jesus, did the room
clear out, Bethany?

01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:51.561
Hell, no. She means presents.
You shouldn't have brought presents.

01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:55.898
It isn't every day somebody
moves into a new house.

01:02:56.065 --> 01:02:58.192
They didn't move into a new house.

01:02:59.402 --> 01:03:01.529
Mom?
In the living room, Russ.

01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:07.368
This house is bigger
than your old one.

01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:09.954
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

01:03:10.121 --> 01:03:14.167
Aunt Bethany, why don't you go with
Francis and Cathrine into the living room...

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:16.836
...and say hello to everybody.
Hello, everybody?

01:03:17.003 --> 01:03:19.130
Just in the living room.
I should say it?

01:03:19.297 --> 01:03:22.258
You should say it.
Hello, everybody!

01:03:23.426 --> 01:03:25.011
Mom.
What?

01:03:25.178 --> 01:03:28.389
This box is meowing.
Let me see it.

01:03:33.686 --> 01:03:36.898
She wrapped up her cat.
Take it in the kitchen and open it up.

01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:40.067
Then we'll have a cat running around.
You can't leave it in the box.

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:42.653
Why would somebody
wrap up a cat in a box?

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.365
She gets confused, Rusty. She and
Uncle Lewis don't have much money...

01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:49.785
...so she takes things from the
house and gives them as presents.

01:03:49.952 --> 01:03:51.871
Great. Can't wait to see what I got.

01:03:52.038 --> 01:03:55.124
This one here is leaking.

01:04:01.172 --> 01:04:04.800
It's lime.
That's her Jell-O mold. I'll take it, Eddie.

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:08.763
Why don't you go back in the living
room and enjoy yourself? Russ?

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:10.264
Come on, boy.

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:13.434
Let's go find your sister.

01:04:34.455 --> 01:04:39.460
Before we begin, since this is
Aunt Bethany's 80th Christmas...

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:43.673
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:44.924
Great.

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:48.719
What, dear?

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.472
Grace!

01:04:52.223 --> 01:04:56.477
Grace? She passed away
30 years ago.

01:04:56.644 --> 01:04:58.980
They want you
to say grace.

01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:03.985
The blessing.

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:26.215
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America...

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:30.094
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

01:05:30.261 --> 01:05:32.680
...one nation under God,
indivisible...

01:05:32.847 --> 01:05:38.102
...with liberty
and justice for all.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:40.688
Amen.
Amen.

01:05:45.776 --> 01:05:49.739
Cathrine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:52.783
...I think we're all in
for a very big treat.

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:55.161
Thank you.

01:05:56.829 --> 01:06:00.374
Save the neck for me, Clark.
Okay, Eddie.

01:06:09.258 --> 01:06:10.593
Look at that.

01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:16.724
Sorry.

01:06:17.183 --> 01:06:21.187
Why are you crying?
I told you we put it in too early.

01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:25.566
Oh, it's just a little dry. It's fine.
It looks good to me.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.610
Here's the heart.

01:07:28.546 --> 01:07:30.256
Aunt Bethany?

01:07:31.507 --> 01:07:33.592
Does your cat, by any chance,
eat Jell-O?

01:07:36.137 --> 01:07:39.640
Well, I don't know about the cat,
but I sure am enjoying it.

01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:54.155
Hey, kids?

01:07:54.739 --> 01:07:59.785
I heard on the news that a pilot spotted
Santa's sled on its way in from New York.

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:08.210
You serious, Clark?

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:15.634
Art, you want to load me up with
a little more there. It is good.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.019
Ed?
Yeah, Clark.

01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:27.020
What's wrong with the dog?

01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:35.237
Oh, he's just yacking on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

01:08:36.906 --> 01:08:39.700
Maybe if you wouldn't
feed him from the table.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.537
No, no.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.707
He's probably just nosing
through the trash there.

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:58.844
Hey, Gris, if you're not doing
anything constructive...

01:08:59.011 --> 01:09:02.348
...run into the living room,
get my stogy.

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:06.268
Is there anything else I can
do for you, Uncle Lewis?

01:09:06.435 --> 01:09:09.854
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:12.817
If he keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.560
That should be it.

01:09:55.067 --> 01:09:56.610
Honey?

01:10:04.285 --> 01:10:08.372
You had too many plugs in one outlet.
Oh, God.

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:11.458
What is it?

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:16.171
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:21.969
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

01:10:26.307 --> 01:10:30.853
If you don't mind, Clark, I'd like to see
if I can fumigate this here chair.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.814
It's a good, quality item.

01:10:35.065 --> 01:10:39.987
If you don't mind me asking,
how much it set you back?

01:10:40.154 --> 01:10:41.989
You smell something?

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:46.118
Fried pussycat.

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:51.665
It's not the chair. It's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.798
Lewis?

01:11:41.882 --> 01:11:43.592
My tree!

01:11:45.177 --> 01:11:46.887
So, what's the matter with you?

01:11:48.389 --> 01:11:50.933
Look what you've done to my tree!

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.062
Lewis.

01:12:05.906 --> 01:12:08.325
It was an ugly tree, anyway.

01:12:08.492 --> 01:12:10.869
At least it's out of its misery.

01:12:11.245 --> 01:12:13.372
Dad's gonna flip out.
Nobody's gonna flip out.

01:12:13.539 --> 01:12:16.208
We're gonna have
a wonderful Christmas.

01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:20.879
What the hell do you want?

01:12:21.046 --> 01:12:26.218
I have a delivery for Clark W. Grisman.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

01:12:26.385 --> 01:12:31.432
...but it fell between the seats,
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

01:12:37.938 --> 01:12:39.940
Merry Christmas.

01:12:40.607 --> 01:12:42.359
Merry Christmas.

01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:47.990
I can't believe it.
What is it?

01:12:48.157 --> 01:12:51.326
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nut house?

01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:53.454
It's from my company.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.165
Your bonus.
My bonus.

01:13:01.879 --> 01:13:03.797
Open it, Clarkie.
Open it.

01:13:04.465 --> 01:13:06.967
Yeah, I hope it's a fortune, Clark.

01:13:07.134 --> 01:13:09.094
I bet you do, Eddie.

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.391
I was afraid....

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:17.478
Are you gonna bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

01:13:19.605 --> 01:13:24.651
I was gonna wait till tomorrow to
tell you all this, but what the heck.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.864
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

01:13:33.243 --> 01:13:35.996
That's it. That's the big one!

01:13:37.998 --> 01:13:39.374
Open it!

01:13:41.293 --> 01:13:45.047
I'm sorry if I've been a little
short with everyone lately.

01:13:45.214 --> 01:13:47.341
I've been waiting
for this bonus.

01:13:47.508 --> 01:13:50.177
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:53.013
...I had to pay in advance.
And until this arrived...

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:56.350
...I didn't have enough in my
account to cover the check.

01:13:56.517 --> 01:13:58.727
Tear the sucker open, Dad.
Yeah.

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:03.732
Drum roll. Just kidding.

01:14:09.905 --> 01:14:14.326
If there's enough left over, I'm gonna fly
you all down here to help us dedicate it.

01:14:18.288 --> 01:14:20.541
I can't swim, Clark.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:23.127
I know that, Eddie.

01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:39.434
Clark, what's wrong?

01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:41.061
Honey?

01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:44.857
It's bigger than you expected?

01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:49.653
Smaller?

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:53.657
What is it?

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:58.662
It's a one-year membership
in the Jelly of the Month Club.

01:14:58.829 --> 01:14:59.830
Oh, God.

01:14:59.997 --> 01:15:04.418
Clark, that's the gift that keeps
on giving the whole year.

01:15:05.752 --> 01:15:09.798
That it is, Edward.
That it is, indeed.

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:13.051
I'm sorry. Clark....

01:15:13.552 --> 01:15:19.099
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got. Goddamn it!

01:15:19.266 --> 01:15:20.726
Son.

01:15:33.614 --> 01:15:37.951
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

01:15:41.914 --> 01:15:43.290
Hey!

01:15:44.249 --> 01:15:49.630
If any of you are looking for any
last-minute gift ideas for me, I have one.

01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:52.633
I'd like Frank Shirley, my boss,
right here, tonight.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.137
I want him brought from his happy
holiday slumber on Melody Lane...

01:15:57.304 --> 01:16:00.390
...with all the other rich people,
and I want him right here.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:02.976
With a big ribbon on his head.

01:16:03.143 --> 01:16:05.646
I wanna look him straight
in the eye and tell him...

01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:08.690
...what a cheap, lying, no good,
rotten, four-flushing...

01:16:08.857 --> 01:16:11.985
...low-life, snake-licking,
dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed...

01:16:12.152 --> 01:16:16.907
...ignorant, bloodsucking, dog-kissing,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:20.827
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:23.997
...worm-headed sack
of monkey shit he is!

01:16:24.164 --> 01:16:28.460
Hallelujah! Holy shit!
Where's the Tylenol?

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:46.561
He's got that crazed look in his eye.
I told you we should've gone to Hawaii.

01:16:46.728 --> 01:16:49.982
Turn that thing off
and get in the house!

01:16:50.148 --> 01:16:52.192
I'll talk to him, Mom.

01:16:55.362 --> 01:16:58.031
You know, Dad.
I've been thinking.

01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:01.410
Good talk, Dad.

01:17:07.207 --> 01:17:09.835
Aren't you a bit sorry we didn't
get a Christmas tree?

01:17:10.002 --> 01:17:13.547
Even though they're dirty and
messy and corny and clichéd.

01:17:13.714 --> 01:17:17.217
Well, where you gonna find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:38.238
What's the matter?

01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:41.908
Was that really necessary?

01:17:43.535 --> 01:17:45.871
We needed a tree.
May I remind you that--

01:17:46.038 --> 01:17:50.250
That this was all my idea. No.
No, no. I'm well aware of that, honey.

01:17:50.542 --> 01:17:53.879
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:57.424
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

01:17:59.718 --> 01:18:04.097
We needed a coffin.
I mean, a tree.

01:18:04.264 --> 01:18:06.350
There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:10.479
Lewis burned down my tree, so I
replaced it as best I could. <i>Voilà.</i>

01:18:11.104 --> 01:18:14.441
Are you okay?
I'm fine, honey.

01:18:38.632 --> 01:18:40.759
Fixed the newelpost.

01:19:03.156 --> 01:19:04.616
What's that sound?

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.309
Do you hear it?
It's a funny squeaky sound.

01:19:32.227 --> 01:19:36.565
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

01:19:38.233 --> 01:19:39.943
I hear it too.

01:19:48.368 --> 01:19:50.245
I don't hear it anymore.

01:20:03.884 --> 01:20:05.760
What was it?! Oh, my God!

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.478
Quiet! Shut up!

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.409
Mom, don't move.

01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:33.413
We can't let it get out
of the living room.

01:20:34.206 --> 01:20:36.917
Where's Eddie? He usually eats
these goddamn things.

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:42.088
Oh, not recently, Clark. He read that
squirrels were high in cholesterol.

01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:44.090
Thank you, Cathrine.

01:20:44.966 --> 01:20:46.384
I'll try and trap it.

01:20:46.635 --> 01:20:48.470
Russ!
Right here, Dad.

01:20:49.179 --> 01:20:51.097
Oh, there you are.

01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:53.266
Go get the hammer.

01:20:53.433 --> 01:20:55.560
Clark, what do you need
a hammer for?

01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:59.272
I'm gonna catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

01:21:06.863 --> 01:21:08.990
I'm going in with him.

01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:13.787
Nora?

01:21:14.788 --> 01:21:17.582
Nora!
Is it gone?

01:21:17.749 --> 01:21:20.794
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

01:21:21.086 --> 01:21:22.963
Squirrel!

01:22:01.585 --> 01:22:05.797
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:09.009
I can't just attack someone.
If you're not man enough...

01:22:09.175 --> 01:22:12.095
...to put an end to this shit,
then I am.

01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:42.000
Oh, my God!

01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:46.796
What happened to you?

01:22:53.928 --> 01:22:57.390
Beautiful. God.

01:22:58.975 --> 01:23:01.978
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:04.814
Nobody's walking out
on this family Christmas.

01:23:04.981 --> 01:23:07.400
No, no. We're all in this together.

01:23:07.651 --> 01:23:10.570
This is a full-blown, four-alarm
holiday emergency here.

01:23:10.945 --> 01:23:14.366
We're gonna press on, and we're gonna
have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas...

01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:16.868
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny Kaye.

01:23:17.369 --> 01:23:20.330
And when Santa squeezes his ass
down that chimney tonight...

01:23:20.497 --> 01:23:24.459
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nut house.

01:23:24.876 --> 01:23:26.127
You're goofy.

01:23:26.294 --> 01:23:28.088
Don't piss me off, Art.
Clark?

01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:31.341
It's over.
Not according to Santa's watch.

01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:33.343
Come on, son.
Stay out of this, Dad.

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:36.554
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

01:23:37.097 --> 01:23:40.100
Before things get worse.
Worse?

01:23:40.266 --> 01:23:41.768
How could they
get any worse?

01:23:41.935 --> 01:23:46.314
Take a look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.458
Son?

01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:09.254
I love you.
We all love you.

01:24:09.504 --> 01:24:13.675
But this is a terrible night. Nothing's
gone right. It's a disaster.

01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:17.137
You losing your temper with the whole
family only makes things worse.

01:24:17.303 --> 01:24:20.306
You're too good a father
to act like this.

01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:26.146
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us.

01:24:26.312 --> 01:24:29.149
And how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

01:24:29.315 --> 01:24:32.318
Well, I just--
You just cocked it up.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.115
Oh, it's okay. It happens.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.996
Our holidays were always such a mess.
Oh, yeah.

01:24:43.496 --> 01:24:45.540
How did you
get through it?

01:24:46.166 --> 01:24:49.169
I had a lot of help
from Jack Daniels.

01:24:57.886 --> 01:24:59.804
I love you.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:03.349
Dad?
Yeah.

01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:07.353
Are you gonna recite
<i>The Night Before Christmas</i> ?

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.565
It's your house.
It's your Christmas.

01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:13.359
I'm retiring.

01:25:14.402 --> 01:25:17.280
"The children were nestled
all snug in their beds...

01:25:17.447 --> 01:25:20.909
...while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads.

01:25:21.075 --> 01:25:23.745
And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap...

01:25:23.912 --> 01:25:26.706
...had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

01:25:26.998 --> 01:25:29.918
When out on the lawn,
there arose such a clatter...

01:25:30.627 --> 01:25:32.545
...I sprang from my bed to see
what was the matter.

01:25:32.796 --> 01:25:35.006
Away to the window,
I flew like a flash...

01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:37.842
...tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash.

01:25:38.009 --> 01:25:42.263
The moon on the new-fallen snow gave
a luster of midday to objects below.

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:48.394
When what to my wondering eyes should
appear but a miniature sleigh and...."

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:52.232
And Eddie with a man in his
pajamas with a dog chain...

01:25:52.398 --> 01:25:54.984
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the--?

01:25:57.237 --> 01:25:58.905
Stay here.

01:26:03.409 --> 01:26:07.247
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Clark.

01:26:08.122 --> 01:26:10.959
You about ready to do some kissing?

01:26:12.627 --> 01:26:15.255
Yes, officer, it seems my husband's
been abducted.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:17.423
The man was...

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:22.136
...wearing a blue leisure suit,
and the plates were from Kansas.

01:26:22.303 --> 01:26:25.765
He was a huge, beastly,
bulging man and--

01:26:26.015 --> 01:26:28.351
I've never been treated
like this in my life.

01:26:28.518 --> 01:26:31.938
I'm sorry. This is our family's
first kidnapping.

01:26:32.105 --> 01:26:35.275
You're fired. And where's the phone?
I'm calling the police.

01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:39.445
Hey, just hold your wad there, fella.
Clark had nothing to do with this.

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:41.781
This here was my idea.

01:26:41.948 --> 01:26:45.785
All right. He's still fired,
and you are going to jail.

01:26:45.952 --> 01:26:49.247
Oh, no. Eddie, it was my fault.

01:26:50.081 --> 01:26:52.208
I lost my temper
when I got my bonus.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:55.461
I guess I said some things I shouldn't have.
Bonus?

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:58.965
How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

01:26:59.132 --> 01:27:01.342
Yeah. Thanks for telling us.

01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:05.597
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

01:27:05.763 --> 01:27:09.851
Seventeen years with the company. I've
gotten a bonus every year but this one.

01:27:10.018 --> 01:27:11.811
You don't wanna give bonuses, fine!

01:27:11.978 --> 01:27:14.772
But when people count on them
as part of their salary...

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:17.483
...well, what you did just plain--
Sucks.

01:27:19.444 --> 01:27:21.154
Thank you, Russ.

01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:24.324
My...

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:27.493
...cousin-in-law, whose heart
is bigger than his brain--

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.913
I appreciate that, Clark.

01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.917
Is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this.

01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:38.671
On behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

01:27:57.023 --> 01:27:58.691
Look...

01:28:00.026 --> 01:28:03.196
...sometimes things look
good on paper...

01:28:03.363 --> 01:28:07.367
...but lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

01:28:08.242 --> 01:28:10.578
I guess a healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much...

01:28:10.745 --> 01:28:13.998
...if to get it you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.920
It's people that make the difference.

01:28:19.087 --> 01:28:21.214
Little people, like you.

01:28:23.091 --> 01:28:26.010
So, Carl...

01:28:26.886 --> 01:28:29.305
...whatever you got last year...

01:28:29.472 --> 01:28:32.058
...add 20 percent.

01:28:33.309 --> 01:28:34.560
Our pool!

01:28:39.524 --> 01:28:40.525
Dad.

01:29:24.986 --> 01:29:27.572
Go away, Todd.

01:29:27.739 --> 01:29:32.493
If you wanna come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

01:29:43.713 --> 01:29:46.924
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

01:29:58.478 --> 01:30:00.313
Freeze!

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:04.150
Not you, them!
Them!

01:30:13.367 --> 01:30:15.286
This way, please.

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:21.709
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
I told you to freeze, mister.

01:30:21.876 --> 01:30:23.503
May we blink?

01:30:27.048 --> 01:30:28.758
Frank.

01:30:29.175 --> 01:30:30.927
Helen!
Thank God, you're all right.

01:30:31.094 --> 01:30:32.929
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

01:30:33.096 --> 01:30:35.264
It was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:38.684
Excuse me. Would you and
Mrs. Shirley like to step outside...

01:30:38.851 --> 01:30:40.937
...so we can take care
of business here?

01:30:41.104 --> 01:30:43.689
There's no business.
I'm not pressing any charges.

01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:45.942
What?
It was a mistake.

01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:49.153
Mistake? Frank, honey,
you were kidnapped.

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:53.032
I did something I shouldn't have,
and these people called me on it.

01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:56.244
This is Clark Griswold
and his family.

01:30:56.410 --> 01:30:58.538
Welcome to our home.

01:30:59.372 --> 01:31:00.748
What's left of it.

01:31:00.915 --> 01:31:03.876
Release B Squad.
What's going on here?

01:31:04.127 --> 01:31:09.090
Remember how I was toying with the notion
of suspending the Christmas bonuses?

01:31:09.257 --> 01:31:14.095
You didn't. Well, of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

01:31:14.262 --> 01:31:17.890
That's pretty low, mister. If I had
a rubber hose, I would beat you to--

01:31:18.057 --> 01:31:20.184
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating the bonuses.

01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:24.230
Look!

01:31:25.982 --> 01:31:27.900
Look, look!

01:31:30.111 --> 01:31:31.571
Look!

01:31:31.737 --> 01:31:34.448
Ruby Sue, sweetheart.

01:31:37.952 --> 01:31:40.413
It's Santa Claus.
What? What's wrong?

01:31:42.248 --> 01:31:45.376
What?
She thinks she sees Santa.

01:31:45.543 --> 01:31:48.421
No, it's the Christmas star.

01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:51.591
And that's all that matters tonight.

01:31:52.758 --> 01:31:57.054
Not bonuses or gifts
or turkeys or trees.

01:31:57.221 --> 01:31:59.015
See, kids...

01:31:59.473 --> 01:32:02.268
...it means something different
to everybody.

01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:06.480
Now I know what it means to me.

01:32:08.024 --> 01:32:10.902
That ain't the frigging
Christmas star, Gris.

01:32:10.928 --> 01:32:13.679
It's a light on the
sewage treatment plant.

01:32:13.821 --> 01:32:15.281
Sewer gas.

01:32:17.283 --> 01:32:19.076
Don't drop that!

01:33:07.291 --> 01:33:08.834
Play ball!

01:33:16.842 --> 01:33:19.345
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

01:33:20.096 --> 01:33:22.056
Merry Christmas, honey.

01:33:23.849 --> 01:33:25.351
Come here.

01:33:50.626 --> 01:33:52.295
I did it.

01:37:08.199 --> 01:37:10.201
