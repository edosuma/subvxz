00:04.938 --> 00:06.497
I got a delivery for you.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.141
Leave it at reception.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.105
I'm supposed to
deliver this one in person.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.409
Clean up on aisle five.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.651
After three years of writing,
one year of shooting,

00:52.719 --> 00:54.847
four years of re-shooting,
and two years of editing,

00:54.922 --> 00:57.448
I have finally
completed my movie,

00:57.524 --> 00:59.755
Threat Level Midnight.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.349
Erin, Erin...
Yes?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.475
What are you doing?

01:23.617 --> 01:24.676
Guys...

01:24.751 --> 01:27.915
Did you guys know that our own
Michael Scott has made a movie,

01:27.988 --> 01:30.287
and that he maybe
will let us watch it,

01:30.624 --> 01:32.786
but only if
everybody's dying to see it?

01:32.859 --> 01:35.055
That's... Well, don't
put words in my mouth.

01:35.596 --> 01:39.761
Threat Level Midnight is the great
lost film of Michael Scott.

01:39.833 --> 01:43.292
We're all in it from, like, years and
years ago. It's like a home movie.

01:43.370 --> 01:47.671
Yeah, if Michael
Scott did your home movie.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.642
Michael screened a work in
progress for us years ago,

01:50.711 --> 01:52.077
and it didn't go well.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.771
We thought it was a comedy.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.147
Everything pointed
to it being a comedy.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.207
Yep.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.275
We'd love to see it.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.016
Sweet. I will go invite Holly.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.716
Okay, everyone, I know
we're really excited to

02:05.792 --> 02:07.727
see this movie
that everybody's in,

02:07.794 --> 02:09.955
but we have to remember
that Michael is sensitive.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.726
So, let's stay positive.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.235
And no laughing, no comments,
just positive energy,

02:15.302 --> 02:17.999
and we'll have
a pure fun day, okay?

02:18.071 --> 02:19.403
Thanks, Mom.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.301
You never told me you made a movie.
Mmm-hmm.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.607
It's got action. It's got heart.
It's got symbolism.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.974
It's got you.
It's got a lot of me.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.776
I can't wait.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.812
Ladies and gentlemen,
Threat Level Midnight.

02:41.728 --> 02:46.428
Michael Scarn? Well, that
is an interesting story.

02:50.037 --> 02:53.098
He was once the best secret
agent in the business.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.113
That was years ago.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.744
Where is he now?

03:05.819 --> 03:09.586
Well, that's also
an interesting story.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.198
Master Scarn.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.293
Master Scarn!

03:20.367 --> 03:23.804
I play Samuel,
Michael Scarn's robot butler.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.463
I wanted Samuel's voice

03:25.539 --> 03:27.872
to be like this.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.739
But Michael thought
that Samuel should be

03:29.810 --> 03:31.176
a very advanced android,

03:31.244 --> 03:34.339
almost indistinguishable
from a real person.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.714
Dwight does not
play a robot.

03:38.985 --> 03:39.975
I'm up.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.043
It's the President.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.384
He needs you for a mission.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.924
Tell him I'm retired.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.389
It's Goldenface.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.156
Goldenface.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.753
This makes it personal.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.238
Scarn, you're right on time.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.730
Hail to the chief.

04:00.874 --> 04:01.898
I gave up a lot of weekends,

04:01.975 --> 04:03.637
because I thought it would
be good for my daughter

04:03.710 --> 04:08.512
to see a black man as President,
even in a silly home movie.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.676
What a stupid waste of time.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.016
It's your old enemy,
Goldenface.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.112
He's after
the NHL all-star game.

04:15.322 --> 04:18.156
He's hidden a bomb somewhere
in the stadium. Scarn,

04:20.026 --> 04:21.358
this one is personal for me.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.726
I own the stadium.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.027
I can't see it blown up.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.532
It's my retirement plan.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.863
We have to search the stadium.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.264
Not so fast.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.100
Goldenface has
taken all of the

04:31.171 --> 04:32.901
concession stand
workers hostage.

04:33.106 --> 04:37.134
Scarn, will you find these
hostages and save the game?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.611
Heads I do it,
tails I don't.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.706
Best out of seven.

04:44.684 --> 04:45.845
Heads.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.222
Tails.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.756
Heads.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.486
Tails.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.087
Heads.

04:58.865 --> 04:59.889
Tails.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.275
Looks like there's gonna be
a clean up on aisle five.

05:17.717 --> 05:20.186
Well,
the hostages were scared.

05:20.253 --> 05:23.382
Don't you guys get it?
Nobody's coming for us.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.516
Oh,
someone's coming, all right.

05:25.592 --> 05:29.393
The only man who would care,
Michael Scarn.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.193
See, I'm gonna lure him here,
then I'm gonna kill everybody,

05:34.267 --> 05:37.294
then I'm gonna dig
up Scarn's dead wife,

05:37.370 --> 05:39.771
and I'm gonna
hump her real good.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.970
I did not
love the dialog,

05:43.410 --> 05:44.844
or the character.

05:44.911 --> 05:49.940
I took the role to impress a
receptionist, who will remain nameless.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.451
Well, the all-star
game was three days away.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.886
So, naturally,
it was all sold out.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.857
The only way Scarn was
getting in was in a uniform.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.756
Just one problem with that.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.694
Scarn didn't know a hockey
stick from a Slim Jim.

06:02.796 --> 06:06.699
So, he went to meet with the
famed trainer, Cherokee Jack.

06:06.766 --> 06:07.995
Mop the ice.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.568
I'm not here to
learn how to mop.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.137
I'm here to learn
how to play hockey.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.330
Mop it.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.581
Come on. Come on!

06:47.073 --> 06:49.372
Now, take this.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.274
What am I
supposed to do with this?

06:51.444 --> 06:52.434
Mop.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.876
Well, Michael Scarn
was quickly becoming

06:59.953 --> 07:02.479
one of the hottest
hockey players in the country.

07:02.555 --> 07:06.287
Each year, the National Hockey
League accepts one civilian amateur

07:06.359 --> 07:07.918
to play in the all-star game.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.724
It's down to the three of you.

07:09.796 --> 07:13.324
The final test
is speed skating.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.999
On your marks, get set...

07:17.370 --> 07:18.463
Die.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.530
Nice try, Goldenface. Except you
forgot one thing, to kill me.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.531
Oh, I wasn't
trying to kill you.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.794
I was trying to
slow you down.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.800
No!

07:51.871 --> 07:53.134
Oh, by the way...

07:53.273 --> 07:54.536
Yeah?

07:54.607 --> 07:56.132
How's your wife doing?

07:59.546 --> 08:00.980
Congratulations.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.516
Hey, you came in second.
Not bad either, champ.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.415
I am so sorry I
have to do this.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.769
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.829
I'm intercepting
a name.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.305
Jasmine Windsong.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.799
She works for Goldenface.

08:29.876 --> 08:33.573
But what I can't figure out
is, who is the Funky Cat?

08:33.645 --> 08:35.376
Not "who," what.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.746
The Funky Cat is the
hippest jazz club in town.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.148
Oh! Oh...

08:47.227 --> 08:49.924
He cut the part where my
circuit board malfunctioned?

08:49.996 --> 08:52.659
Then what was the point of
spilling the drink on me?

08:53.600 --> 09:00.006
They call me Jasmine Windsong

09:00.073 --> 09:02.133
Bingo.

09:02.609 --> 09:06.740
He finished his movie? No kidding.
Wow, that's great.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.509
Yeah, good for him.

09:20.660 --> 09:25.030
The hostages are
under the stadium

09:31.805 --> 09:33.034
Check, please.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.736
You have to let us go, Goldenface.
We have families.

09:36.810 --> 09:41.510
Ha! This is gonna show them
that I mean business.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.809
See ya.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.492
Far and away the most
expensive shot of the movie,

09:55.562 --> 09:59.192
but it was
integral to the story.

10:01.534 --> 10:02.968
It's Scarn!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.534
Sorry about
your friend, Scarn.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.506
The joke's on you,
Goldenface.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.770
That man was
a wanted animal rapist.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.078
We've searched the whole
building, Goldenface.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.011
Where is the bomb?
Hmm?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.111
We've searched the whole
building, Goldenface.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.844
Where is the bomb?
Hmm?

10:17.917 --> 10:19.715
We've searched the...
Okay.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.346
He said,
"Where is the bomb?"

10:22.489 --> 10:23.718
In the puck.

10:24.824 --> 10:26.452
But why are you
telling me this?

10:26.526 --> 10:29.428
Because I'm going
to kill you, unless

10:29.496 --> 10:31.260
you forgive me for
murdering your wife.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.909
Hey, Goldenface.
Yeah?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.377
Go puck yourself.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.906
No!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.645
That was not scripted.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.117
More Tylenol.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.558
You've already had four.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.127
Oh, God!

11:02.996 --> 11:04.157
So good.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.458
You're lucky
to be alive.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.829
It'll take a lot more
than a bullet to the brain,

11:07.901 --> 11:11.929
lungs, heart, back and balls
to kill Michael Scarn.

11:12.005 --> 11:16.170
Let's just make sure that
everything's working properly.

11:26.819 --> 11:30.881
You just said,
"The bomb is in the puck"?

11:30.957 --> 11:32.050
Yes.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.219
Is that where you hid
the bomb, Goldenface?

11:37.564 --> 11:39.465
But why would you
blow up the stadium?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.296
You own the stadium.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.496
For the insurance money.
I knew it all along.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.538
You will never
get away with this.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.119
Where had I gone wrong?

12:02.188 --> 12:06.182
All I wanted was to start a
family with my beautiful wife,

12:06.259 --> 12:10.162
but somewhere along the way,
things got messed up.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.062
It wasn't easy
for Scarn to admit

12:12.198 --> 12:14.030
that he'd lost
his self-confidence.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.634
And he hadn't, of course.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.529
He just wasn't
using it right now.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.937
Mike!

12:20.006 --> 12:21.269
Beer me, Billy.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.567
You don't look so good.
What's got you down?

12:23.643 --> 12:26.169
I got problems, Billy.
Big problems.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.841
You got problems?
My TV don't work.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.352
I pay $30 a month for the damn
satellite whats-a-whose-it.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.478
I can't even
get the damn game.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.715
Now, you tell me,
what's worse than that?

12:37.357 --> 12:38.791
Don't ever change, Billy.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.694
Goldenface is going to blow up
the NHL all-star game tomorrow.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.725
I see what you
mean about problems.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.098
I know what'll cheer you up.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.967
That table of bachelorettes over
there bought you this drink.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.873
Hey.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.903
Ever banged an entire
bachelorette party, baby?

13:01.514 --> 13:05.246
Why are you singling my line out,
like, a million years later?

13:05.318 --> 13:08.117
I'm too depressed
to save the big game, Billy.

13:08.187 --> 13:12.090
I'm gonna cheer you up the only
ways I know hows. Hey, kid,

13:14.360 --> 13:16.056
hit G-9 on the jukebox.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.896
No, Billy, I haven't done that
dance since my wife died.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.401
There's a whole
crowd of people out there

13:22.535 --> 13:25.004
who need to learn
how to do the Scarn.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.713
Well, my name's Michael Scarn
And I'm here to say

13:35.815 --> 13:37.841
I'm about to do the Scarn
In a major way

13:42.455 --> 13:44.447
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

13:44.524 --> 13:46.686
Then you jump to the left
And you shake that hand

13:46.759 --> 13:48.887
You meet new friends
You tie some yarn

13:48.961 --> 13:51.021
And that's how
you do the Scarn

13:51.097 --> 13:53.157
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

13:53.232 --> 13:55.463
Then you jump to the left
And you shake that hand

13:55.535 --> 13:57.629
Meet new friends
Tie that yarn

13:57.704 --> 13:59.673
That's how you do the Scarn

13:59.739 --> 14:01.332
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

14:01.407 --> 14:03.433
Shh. Stop.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.272
Meet new friends
Tie that yarn

14:06.346 --> 14:08.508
That's how you do the Scarn

14:08.581 --> 14:11.710
If doing the Scarn is gay,

14:11.784 --> 14:14.515
then I'm
the biggest queer on earth!

14:15.455 --> 14:17.321
You guys, I think I have...
Sorry.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.621
I'm really sorry.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.286
Hey, hey.
Michael!

14:22.362 --> 14:25.821
Michael, I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.298
I think I was just
relieved to see that

14:27.433 --> 14:28.867
Michael Scarn got
his confidence back.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.062
Yeah, Michael,
the movie's amazing.

14:30.136 --> 14:33.265
It's, like, one of the best
movies I've ever seen in my life.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.864
You should enter
it in festivals.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.136
Or carnivals.
Yeah.

14:37.110 --> 14:41.445
Well, that's a pretty good reaction.
That's pretty cool, right?

14:41.848 --> 14:44.181
Did you like it?
Did you like that?

14:44.250 --> 14:46.151
Which part?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.246
Okay.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.154
All right.
Come on.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.556
No.
Michael.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.059
No, come on!

14:54.193 --> 14:55.661
We have to see the end.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.163
No, it's not good enough.
It's not good enough.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.427
Some people are
really popping on-screen.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.166
Hey.
Hey.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.969
Good movie.
Mmm.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.371
Good?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.173
Everybody out
there says it's great.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.237
I loved it.
Did you?

15:14.313 --> 15:15.679
What did you love about it?

15:15.748 --> 15:20.015
Um... I loved that you got to work
together with all your friends.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.110
Mmm-hmm.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.383
Isn't that so great when you can
all work together like that?

15:23.456 --> 15:26.324
No, no. Holly,
this isn't Ocean's Eleven,

15:26.392 --> 15:27.724
where you get together
with all your friends,

15:27.794 --> 15:30.059
and you just have fun, and you
don't care about how it turns out.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.597
What'd you really think,
honestly?

15:32.665 --> 15:33.758
Um...

15:33.900 --> 15:35.528
Is it...

15:35.601 --> 15:37.866
Is it because you're afraid of
where this is gonna take me?

15:37.937 --> 15:41.237
Because, see, I need you
to keep me grounded.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.101
Not worried about that.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.440
This is 11 years, okay?

15:48.514 --> 15:51.211
This has been
my dream for 11 years,

15:51.284 --> 15:52.980
and if you don't
think it's great,

15:53.052 --> 15:55.248
then you're basically saying
you don't believe in my dream.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.485
It's your dream? You never
even mentioned it before.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.789
We talk about
a lot of things, Holly.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.761
You know, I was
eventually going to

16:02.829 --> 16:05.890
get around to my dream,
obviously.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.297
Eleven years
that I could've been

16:07.366 --> 16:08.891
working on "The
Scarn Nebulous."

16:08.968 --> 16:11.369
Well, why do you have to
make a movie at all?

16:11.437 --> 16:13.997
Because if I don't have this,
what do I have? I have nothing.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.774
Really? You can't think of
anything else that you might have?

16:17.844 --> 16:20.541
I have my book on business,
Somehow I Manage.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.648
I have my HBO comedy special,
"Here I Go Again..."

16:24.717 --> 16:26.652
But, you know what?
When I think about it,

16:26.719 --> 16:30.053
when I really think about it,
none of those things

16:30.122 --> 16:32.318
are as real to me
as my movie.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.517
I'm real.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.753
Yeah, you're
a real pain in the ass.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.863
And now, I'm gonna
go watch the movie

16:38.998 --> 16:40.398
with people who
think it's great.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.163
And I'm sorry I called
you a pain in the ass.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.262
I'm angry, and I love you.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.568
I love you, too.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.737
I am a huge Woody Allen fan.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.576
Although I've only seen Antz.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.742
But I'll tell you something,
what I respect about that man

16:57.817 --> 16:59.012
is that when he
was going through

16:59.085 --> 17:01.247
all of that stuff that
came out in the press,

17:01.320 --> 17:04.381
about how Antz was just
a rip-off of A Bug's Life,

17:04.457 --> 17:07.950
he stayed true to his films.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.191
Or at least the film that I
saw, which, again, was Antz.

17:11.263 --> 17:12.925
Thing is,

17:12.999 --> 17:14.762
I thought A Bug's
Life was better,

17:14.834 --> 17:17.394
much better than Antz.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.667
Point is, don't listen
to your critics.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.300
Listen to your fans.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.002
Who likes Threat
Level Midnight?

17:28.247 --> 17:30.682
Okay, well, then who wants
to watch the rest?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.122
Michael, you have to get
to that puck before halftime

17:37.189 --> 17:39.181
or the whole
stadium will explode.

17:39.258 --> 17:42.524
I know. It's a good thing my trainer
and mentor is here to cheer me on.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.756
Cherokee Jack?

17:43.829 --> 17:46.628
Michael, he died.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.538
This one's for you,
Cherokee Jack.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.611
We filmed this
during an actual

18:09.755 --> 18:11.280
Scranton High School
hockey game.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.053
They were trying to
qualify for states...

18:13.426 --> 18:15.156
It's fine. It's great.

18:15.227 --> 18:18.459
No, no. Actually, it was
really screwed up because

18:18.531 --> 18:20.898
they were trying to qualify.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.095
They were disqualified.
They had to forfeit the game.

18:24.170 --> 18:27.163
Undefeated season. That's why
there were so many people there.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.145
Why is your face gold?

18:32.211 --> 18:33.873
Why do you care?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.381
I'm just making conversation.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.078
I worked in a gold factory.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.313
We had a boss who
only cared about money.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.185
Hey.
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.621
It is good.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.157
No, no, it's not.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.217
It's not.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.822
But they really seem
to be enjoying it. Come on.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.559
Please,
Goldenface, let us go!

19:02.074 --> 19:03.337
Cherokee Jack.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.969
I want you to take
all your frustrations

19:06.045 --> 19:08.514
with women,
the system, with everything,

19:09.148 --> 19:10.707
take it out on the puck.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.745
All on the puck.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.113
Hey, we got
sports games again.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.713
Oh...

19:58.297 --> 20:02.234
Some breakfast for me,
some breakfast for you.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.970
Yeah, I guess I did
let him be a robot.

20:10.242 --> 20:11.835
I'll get it.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.402
Man, I love being retired.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.237
Scarn here.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.283
Michael, it's the President.
Hello, sir.

20:17.349 --> 20:18.908
I need you for
another mission.

20:21.921 --> 20:22.945
Yeah, I'm in.

20:25.424 --> 20:28.155
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
isn't the President evil?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.994
Oh, yeah. Yes, he is.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.862
No, no, he's doing it
to catch the President.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.528
No, no, Dwight,
he's just being stupid.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.974
Well, Michael Scarn
was back in the game.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.373
And I bet you're wondering

20:43.476 --> 20:47.743
why do I know so much
about Michael Scarn?

20:47.813 --> 20:51.306
Well, because
I am Michael Scarn.
