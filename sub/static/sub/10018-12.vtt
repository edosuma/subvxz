00:06.947 --> 00:08.468
Previously on E.R.

00:08.469 --> 00:10.711
'96 is gonna be
a hell of a year, huh?

00:10.712 --> 00:12.626
- She had me served at work.
- Jennifer?

00:12.727 --> 00:14.485
My dad will take me home in a while.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.933
Stay and get straightened out.
Give Noah something to be proud of.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.216
If it's about you and me, get over it.

00:20.217 --> 00:21.641
Don't you turn your back on me!

00:21.742 --> 00:23.946
- Dad called.
- So, what did you say?

00:23.947 --> 00:26.246
I told him to get lost.

00:26.547 --> 00:29.413
It's time we made Dr. Benton
an official member of the team.

00:29.414 --> 00:30.414
Don't you think, Claire?

00:30.620 --> 00:34.394
She's a sinking ship,
and you're rearranging her deck chairs.

00:34.395 --> 00:35.395
Doctor,
I'm not ready to let her go yet.

00:37.957 --> 00:39.533
"True Lies"

00:39.534 --> 00:42.286
Rach. Rachel.

00:42.453 --> 00:44.747
Come on, honey, it's time to get up.

00:45.373 --> 00:47.584
Rachel.

00:48.085 --> 00:50.129
Uppy, uppy, squeezer!

00:50.295 --> 00:52.589
Daddy, I'm not a squeezer.

00:52.756 --> 00:56.385
Oh, yeah?
I made you Eggs in the Window.

00:59.179 --> 01:01.098
Come on.

01:04.185 --> 01:06.521
Hello? Hey, Jen.

01:07.647 --> 01:09.774
She slept great.

01:10.316 --> 01:13.653
She read Winnie the Pooh
and did her homework.

01:14.237 --> 01:16.823
Okay, 2:00 will be fine.

01:17.449 --> 01:21.412
I am not signing anything
until my lawyer comes-

01:21.579 --> 01:23.539
There she is, she's up.

01:23.706 --> 01:26.041
Hey, Rach! Mom wants to talk to you.

01:27.418 --> 01:29.420
Hello.

01:32.381 --> 01:33.549
Okay.

01:34.885 --> 01:36.928
I guess.

01:37.095 --> 01:38.180
No.

01:38.346 --> 01:40.015
Here's Daddy.

01:43.018 --> 01:45.979
Nothing, she just got up.

01:46.563 --> 01:48.899
Look, I am not badmouthing you.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.904
Her breakfast is getting cold.
I'll see you at 2.

01:54.238 --> 01:57.074
Your mom's gonna come
pick you up later, okay?

01:58.534 --> 02:00.828
How long are you gonna stay here?

02:00.995 --> 02:02.705
A while.

02:02.872 --> 02:06.501
So it would be great if you could draw
some pictures for the walls.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.753
The window's too big.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.299
It still tastes good. It's okay.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.510
- I don't like eggs.
- Since when?

02:15.677 --> 02:18.889
If Mommy said she was sorry,
would you stop being mad at her?

02:19.056 --> 02:22.435
- I'm not mad at Mommy.
- Are you gonna move back to Milwaukee?

02:24.354 --> 02:26.022
Maybe. We'll have to see.

02:26.189 --> 02:30.610
When you move back home,
can we put the fish tank in my room?

02:30.777 --> 02:32.612
Yeah, sure we can.

02:32.779 --> 02:36.116
And you'll help me
take care of it every day?

02:38.786 --> 02:40.996
Let's go to Lou Mitchell's
and get pancakes.

02:41.163 --> 02:45.125
And after I drop some stuff off at work,
we can go ice-skating.

02:45.292 --> 02:48.087
You don't know
how to skate very well, Daddy.

02:48.253 --> 02:50.589
Well, then, you can teach me, all right?

02:56.304 --> 02:59.557
Easy, easy! That's precious cargo.

02:59.724 --> 03:01.893
Honey, it's okay.

03:02.060 --> 03:04.312
Sign here and here...

03:04.479 --> 03:07.108
...and here.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.901
BP is great.

03:09.068 --> 03:11.696
- So you finally got a normal reading.
- Yep. Three.

03:11.862 --> 03:13.239
Good for you.

03:13.406 --> 03:16.367
- She's just going to decompensate.
- Maybe, but not here.

03:16.534 --> 03:18.494
The nursing home is in Evanston.

03:18.661 --> 03:20.329
All right, let's go.

03:21.622 --> 03:24.459
Tompkins is the next patient.
Now, last time we said-

03:24.626 --> 03:27.003
Well, you're looking much better, I see.

03:27.170 --> 03:30.048
- Says who?
- Pull Tompkins' CVP line, please.

03:30.215 --> 03:33.093
Doctor, when is she going
to be able to walk?

03:33.260 --> 03:37.472
Mr. Carter will accompany you. You can
address any further concerns with him.

03:37.639 --> 03:39.267
Peter, may I see you for a minute?

03:39.434 --> 03:44.355
Carter, Dr. Benton needs some coded data
sheets for the Investigation Review Board.

03:44.522 --> 03:48.359
Peter, I want you to come
to a dinner party I'm having tonight.

03:48.526 --> 03:52.029
It's 8:30 sharp. We have Dean
Adelstein-Fields from Johns Hopkins...

03:52.196 --> 03:55.284
- Gaylord Fields?
- Sorry it's such late notice, but...

03:55.451 --> 03:58.454
- What is it, Carter?
- The transfer authorization.

04:00.205 --> 04:02.124
- Bye, Carter.
- So that's you and a guest.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.042
And, Peter, please...

04:04.209 --> 04:05.794
...don't be late.

04:06.378 --> 04:08.380
Well, Mrs. Tompkins...

04:12.135 --> 04:15.430
- We thought we'd lost you.
- No, I'm here. Hey, Jeanie.

04:15.597 --> 04:18.433
She doesn't seem to have
much of an appetite yet.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.642
- Well, Mr. Rubadoux...
- Please, Ruby.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.855
Ruby, she just had a major surgery.
It takes time to recover.

04:24.022 --> 04:26.066
Stop pestering the young man.

04:26.233 --> 04:30.696
Who's pestering? He's the only
doctor worth a damn in my book.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.032
Coughing still, you know?

04:33.199 --> 04:35.576
I think the pneumonia's back.

04:35.910 --> 04:38.579
She's on powerful antibiotics.
She's fine.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.082
The convalescent home
is too far from the hospital.

04:41.249 --> 04:44.211
We've been over this.
She responded well to the medication.

04:44.377 --> 04:47.964
It's time for her to go. Dr. Chung
at the convalescent home concurs.

04:48.131 --> 04:51.092
Dr. Chung. Egg rolls they know,
but medicine?

04:51.259 --> 04:53.470
Jules, enough!

04:57.266 --> 04:59.560
She won't have to stay in bed,
will she?

04:59.727 --> 05:01.812
She'll be back on her feet in no time.

05:01.979 --> 05:04.440
You sure she shouldn't have stayed
a few more days?

05:04.607 --> 05:06.442
She looks great. She's doing great.

05:06.609 --> 05:10.196
- Goodbye, Mrs. Rubadoux.
- Well, God bless, Dr. Carter!

05:10.738 --> 05:13.200
What a boy! What a boy!

05:15.000 --> 05:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:24.336 --> 05:26.213
Yes!

06:17.893 --> 06:19.854
February's Residents' schedule.

06:20.021 --> 06:22.648
ACl's done. It just
needs a fever-control sheet.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.775
Thanks. Hi, Rach! I love your outfit.

06:24.942 --> 06:26.902
Carol's talking to you, honey.

06:27.069 --> 06:28.905
Aunt Bubble Butt gave it to me.

06:29.072 --> 06:31.074
- Rach.
- That's what you call her.

06:31.241 --> 06:32.868
That's nice. "Aunt Bubble Butt. "

06:33.034 --> 06:36.246
- Hey.
- Susie! Can I hold her?

06:36.413 --> 06:39.541
Oh, yeah.
If you're really, really careful, though.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.710
Use both hands, honey, okay?

06:46.424 --> 06:48.885
That's the first smile
I've seen all morning.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.929
- Rough couple of days?
- You have no idea.

06:52.096 --> 06:54.098
Aren't you on the swing shift?

06:54.265 --> 06:56.893
Yeah. I came by
to catch up on dictations.

06:57.059 --> 06:59.061
I think you should go skating instead.

06:59.228 --> 07:01.273
I have so much paperwork!

07:01.440 --> 07:03.525
Little Susie would love it...

07:04.276 --> 07:06.153
...and it would help me out.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.946
I'm really behind.

07:08.989 --> 07:10.616
Oh, what the hell. Okay.

07:10.783 --> 07:12.743
Excellent.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.872
- Guess who's coming skating.
- Susie's coming!

07:16.039 --> 07:19.042
Yes. As soon as I get her bundled up.

07:19.209 --> 07:22.170
- Her too?
- Of course. She's a good skater.

07:22.337 --> 07:25.298
- I'll teach you how to do a spin.
- I know how to do a spin.

07:25.465 --> 07:27.842
You wanna put Little Susie's cap on?

07:28.009 --> 07:30.011
- She'll be fine.
- Okay.

07:30.971 --> 07:34.475
- Just say no to colic.
- Doug, your dad's called three times.

07:34.642 --> 07:37.520
- If you don't call, he'll keep bugging us.
- I have nothing to say.

07:37.686 --> 07:40.356
His number's right there.
He's staying at the Hotel Dupre.

07:40.523 --> 07:42.858
One step up from a refrigerator box.

07:43.025 --> 07:45.319
- Carter, where you been?
- Seeing patients.

07:45.486 --> 07:48.907
Vucelich's data sheets.
Tomorrow morning before rounds.

07:49.074 --> 07:52.786
- Rubadoux's discharge summary?
- That is in your box. I finally turfed her.

07:52.953 --> 07:56.164
- Husband drove you nuts, huh?
- You have no idea.

07:56.748 --> 08:00.669
So who are you taking tonight to
Vucelich's big dinner party?

08:00.835 --> 08:02.838
- Nobody.
- Nobody? You gotta take somebody.

08:03.005 --> 08:04.215
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

08:04.382 --> 08:07.468
He said bring a guest.
That sounded like an order.

08:08.010 --> 08:11.347
- I don't know, I was thinking Jackie.
- Your sister?

08:11.514 --> 08:13.307
You can't take your sister.

08:13.474 --> 08:15.559
- Why not?
- That just seems kind of...

08:15.726 --> 08:17.354
Kind of what?

08:17.521 --> 08:18.939
Pathetic.

08:19.106 --> 08:21.066
What about...?

08:21.233 --> 08:24.152
Carter, I can find my own damn dates.

08:24.319 --> 08:25.737
Okay. Fine.

08:25.904 --> 08:28.865
It's gonna be surgeons,
their trophy wives and you...

08:29.032 --> 08:31.034
...with your sister!

08:40.419 --> 08:43.923
The boy with inguinal hernia repair
was discharged yesterday.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.426
- Kids recover fast.
- Yeah.

08:50.222 --> 08:52.891
They seem to be keeping
you busy down here.

08:53.058 --> 08:56.186
Aerobic medicine. You should see me
crawl home every night.

08:57.021 --> 08:59.982
Yeah, well, if you're not
too tired tonight...

09:00.149 --> 09:02.860
...Dr. Vucelich, this vascular surgeon
I'm assisting...

09:03.027 --> 09:04.904
I know who Dr. Vucelich is.

09:05.905 --> 09:08.491
Anyway, he's having
some colleagues to dinner.

09:08.658 --> 09:11.453
It's not a social thing.
It's mostly surgeons.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.997
Peter, are you asking me to dinner?

09:15.290 --> 09:18.543
- It's a hospital function.
- As opposed to a date.

09:20.421 --> 09:22.089
What time do we need to be there?

09:22.256 --> 09:26.427
Starts at 8. He lives on North Lake Shore.
I could pick you up at 7:30.

09:26.594 --> 09:29.305
I'll meet you there.
It's not a date.

09:35.562 --> 09:38.940
- Need some help lifting.
- What the hell is that?

09:39.107 --> 09:40.817
Guardrail pinned him to the car seat.

09:40.984 --> 09:42.944
Page Benton
and call Engineering for a saw.

09:43.111 --> 09:44.905
'67 GTO, right?

09:45.072 --> 09:47.574
- Car's toast.
- What a waste.

09:47.741 --> 09:50.161
Rollover TC on the Ike.
Two fatalities.

09:50.328 --> 09:53.122
Guy's car flipped
and hit the pipe guardrail.

09:53.289 --> 09:55.792
- Good cap refill.
- Absent breath sounds on the left.

09:55.958 --> 10:00.296
- Chest-tube tray!
- BP's 100/60, pulse 120.

10:00.463 --> 10:03.132
O-2 at 10 liters, 1500 cc's saline in.

10:03.299 --> 10:05.719
C- spined the best we could.

10:05.886 --> 10:08.347
- Hell of an extrication.
- BP, 110 palp.

10:08.514 --> 10:11.975
CBC, type and cross 10 units.
Get four units O-neg just in case.

10:12.142 --> 10:16.271
- How the hell am I supposed to tube him?
- Somebody call for a metal saw?

10:16.438 --> 10:18.816
I want you to cut
between the chair and his back.

10:18.982 --> 10:20.484
- Gown him!
- Me?

10:23.988 --> 10:26.741
- That's a nice one.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get sick.

10:26.908 --> 10:29.494
- Hey, you wanna show me your spin?
- No.

10:31.329 --> 10:33.665
So how's she taking the divorce?

10:33.832 --> 10:37.670
We haven't told her yet. She's still
getting used to the separation.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.381
Let me take Susie
so you can skate with her.

10:40.548 --> 10:43.551
Are you kidding?
This is what's holding me up.

10:45.261 --> 10:47.429
Come on, Miss Munchkin.

10:47.596 --> 10:51.016
You're so funny. Are you ready?

10:51.183 --> 10:53.186
Here comes Dad!

10:53.770 --> 10:56.022
Why do you stick your butt out so far?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.191
I'll just tuck it in. Is that what...?

11:00.402 --> 11:03.238
Nice! Half a grundoolie.

11:03.405 --> 11:05.407
I give it a 6.5!

11:06.199 --> 11:09.161
Hey, Rachel, you want me to
show you how to tie your skates...

11:09.328 --> 11:11.289
...so your ankles stay straight?

11:11.455 --> 11:13.624
I want to tie my skates
like Mommy does.

11:13.791 --> 11:16.794
- Rachel...
- I don't want her touching my skates.

11:19.505 --> 11:21.632
- Sorry.
- Maybe this was a bad idea.

11:23.468 --> 11:26.638
Rach. Rach!

11:28.181 --> 11:30.183
Rachel.

11:31.184 --> 11:32.769
Gown me!

11:32.936 --> 11:34.896
My first medical consult.

11:35.063 --> 11:36.565
O.R.'s ready.

11:36.732 --> 11:39.610
Carter, Vucelich's chart
is done for the data sheets?

11:39.777 --> 11:42.113
Almost. What do you want me to do?

11:42.572 --> 11:45.450
Throw in a left chest tube.
36 French.

11:46.951 --> 11:49.120
BP's fallen, 50 systolic.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.790
Ten blade.

11:52.957 --> 11:56.211
Crank up the saline. Two more units
packed cells on the infuser.

11:56.378 --> 11:57.421
Bullet!

11:57.588 --> 11:58.756
High-speed impalement,
hypovolemic shock.

11:58.922 --> 12:02.718
Widened mediastinum,
maybe a rupture of the aorta.

12:02.926 --> 12:05.512
- Call Vucelich.
- Thora-Seal's filling.

12:05.679 --> 12:09.266
Get him upstairs. We'll do
a trans-esophageal before we prep.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.269
- Carter, where are you going?
- The O.R.

12:11.436 --> 12:14.397
- You have work to do.
- He should see this case.

12:14.564 --> 12:16.524
Here he is. Dr. Carter!

12:16.691 --> 12:19.444
She said her chest hurt,
then she passed out.

12:19.611 --> 12:22.489
I insisted they bring her
back here to you.

12:22.655 --> 12:25.785
- Carter, tend to your patient.
- Thought I was going to the O.R.

12:25.951 --> 12:28.788
Not anymore!
And don't make a career of her.

12:28.996 --> 12:31.415
Dr. Carter, please!

12:39.715 --> 12:41.676
Take your time.

12:41.843 --> 12:43.929
Say goodbye to Rachel.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.556
- Bye-bye, Rachel!
- Say bye, Rach.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.683
Dr. Greene. Your wife called.

12:48.850 --> 12:50.936
Her doctor's appointment got changed.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.105
Why are you working
behind the counter, E-Ray?

12:53.271 --> 12:57.235
Jerry got the flu. I'm supplementing
my meager nurse-trainee stipend...

12:57.401 --> 12:59.362
...with some clerking shifts.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.698
- Does Personnel know?
- Yes. I'm overqualified, actually.

13:02.865 --> 13:07.578
Hundred and twenty words per minute,
IBM, Mac, word processing, spreadsheets.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.081
Did she say when she would get here?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.251
- As soon as she can.
- Right.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.378
Rachel, let's get you in the lounge.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.505
We need you in Trauma 2.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.632
I'll take her.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.801
Licensed lllinois daycare worker.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.470
All right. Easy, now.

13:28.393 --> 13:30.728
Tie that bleeder off.

13:32.647 --> 13:34.524
All right. We have exposure.

13:34.691 --> 13:36.651
Finally we can do some work.

13:36.818 --> 13:38.862
The artery was grazed. It could blow.

13:39.028 --> 13:41.656
We'll have to bypass him.
Let's take this slow.

13:41.823 --> 13:44.410
Set up the roller pump
and call in the Tech.

13:45.077 --> 13:48.247
- We should clamp-and-run.
- The damage is too extensive.

13:48.414 --> 13:50.499
He's unstable. This aorta could blow.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.168
If we bypass him,
we have a safety net.

13:53.335 --> 13:56.505
In that time, we could clamp
proximally and distally...

13:56.672 --> 13:58.842
...pull out the rail
and sew in a graft.

13:59.009 --> 14:02.304
- How long will that take?
- I'll be out in 35 minutes.

14:02.470 --> 14:05.515
- Get me an ETA on Vucelich.
- At least half an hour.

14:05.765 --> 14:08.685
- I could be closing when he gets here.
- It's too risky.

14:08.852 --> 14:11.021
I've assisted on five of these
and done two.

14:11.187 --> 14:13.481
I can do this.

14:16.068 --> 14:18.195
You heard the man. Let's do it.

14:18.362 --> 14:20.031
Statinsky!

14:20.197 --> 14:22.491
Found at Louie's Ribs,
passed out drunk.

14:22.658 --> 14:25.036
Acute respiratory distress.
She won't give her name.

14:25.202 --> 14:29.499
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- BP's 70/50. Pulse 120.

14:29.666 --> 14:33.629
GCS 8. I gave her glucose,
Narcan and 40 of Lasix.

14:33.795 --> 14:36.298
- Okay, let's move her.
- Watch the line.

14:37.007 --> 14:39.468
Ready, set, go!

14:41.053 --> 14:43.013
She's really cyanotic.

14:43.722 --> 14:45.266
Pulse ox, 72.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.101
She's in pulmonary edema.

14:47.268 --> 14:49.979
Intubation tray. ET tube 7.0.

14:50.146 --> 14:54.067
I'll have to put a tube down
your windpipe so you can breathe, okay?

14:54.233 --> 14:56.444
Just try and relax, okay?

14:56.611 --> 14:59.072
Rapid sequence induction?

14:59.238 --> 15:02.618
Definitely bourbon.
Let's try two of Versed first.

15:02.785 --> 15:05.454
Get a blood gas, CBC, Chem-7...

15:05.621 --> 15:09.416
...enzymes, portable chest.
Check for ID.

15:09.583 --> 15:13.295
- BP's 80/50. Dopamine drip?
- Yeah.

15:13.462 --> 15:15.924
I'm in. Inflate the cuff.

15:16.091 --> 15:19.552
- V-fib!
- Charging to 200! Everybody off!

15:23.765 --> 15:25.433
Just a sec.

15:26.601 --> 15:28.269
- Okay.
- Clear!

15:31.732 --> 15:35.820
- Sinus tach. Faint pulse.
- Lidocaine, 100 IV push.

15:35.986 --> 15:38.114
Hang a drip. 2 mg a minute.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.117
Shoot a chest, get a gas
and call Respiratory.

15:41.283 --> 15:44.578
- Lidocaine, 2 grams...
- Her name's Barbara Dean.

15:45.329 --> 15:47.374
- Wow!
- Wow, what?

15:47.541 --> 15:49.501
Today's her 50th birthday.

15:49.668 --> 15:52.379
- No kidding?
- Nope.

15:52.546 --> 15:55.006
She looks pretty old for 50.

15:55.173 --> 15:58.135
Looks like she did
all her partying up front.

15:58.301 --> 16:02.306
- Sylvie.
- We're getting good returns.

16:02.974 --> 16:05.351
Come on, honey.
I'm right here, sweetheart.

16:05.518 --> 16:07.145
Sylvie, please!

16:07.311 --> 16:09.147
She's not responding.

16:09.313 --> 16:12.066
- She may have had a small stroke.
- Stroke?

16:12.233 --> 16:14.861
- Be careful of the sterile field.
- She had a stroke?

16:15.027 --> 16:17.321
It's really too early to tell that.

16:17.488 --> 16:20.033
She was fine until I took her
to the nursing home.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.412
- Ruby, please give us room to work, okay?
- What happened?

16:23.579 --> 16:25.706
Did she leave the hospital too soon?

16:25.873 --> 16:28.000
I'll be back in a minute.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.127
Stroke?

16:30.294 --> 16:33.172
We'll take very good care of her.

16:39.012 --> 16:41.347
- E-Ray, what is that?
- Skin lesions.

16:41.514 --> 16:42.765
This is nightmare material.

16:42.932 --> 16:47.478
On the contrary. Children benefit
from confronting their fears...

16:47.645 --> 16:49.607
...in a supportive environment.

16:49.773 --> 16:53.027
- It's cool, Daddy!
- Let's finish The Little Mermaid.

16:53.193 --> 16:55.529
Mrs. Hardy, we need you
to sign some papers.

16:55.696 --> 16:57.698
Yes, she was.

16:57.865 --> 16:59.825
Well, she's extremely ill-

17:00.784 --> 17:03.829
I understand, but your mother's
in grave condition.

17:03.996 --> 17:05.957
Old records on Barbara Dean.

17:06.124 --> 17:08.126
She hung up.

17:09.044 --> 17:13.048
Detox twice, D.T.'s,
fractured wrist, seizures.

17:13.214 --> 17:15.717
End-stage liver disease
and cardiomyopathy.

17:15.884 --> 17:19.054
Her daughter won't come in.
Said she's had enough.

17:19.220 --> 17:21.641
Mrs. Dean seems
to have had enough too.

17:21.807 --> 17:24.727
- Dr. Ross, it's your father again.
- Tell him I died.

17:24.894 --> 17:26.811
Beautiful funeral, everybody cried.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.273
- You won't believe this one.
- Oh, yeah? Try us.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.276
Guess who's in the Suture Room.

17:32.443 --> 17:34.320
- Come on, guess.
- We don't wanna guess.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.032
He's wearing
a Catholic schoolgirl's outfit.

17:37.199 --> 17:40.786
Plaid skirt, ballet slippers,
frilly blouse.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.289
David Morgenstern ring a bell?

17:46.458 --> 17:47.584
Our David Morgenstern?

17:47.751 --> 17:50.922
- Knee socks too.
- Somebody get a camera!

17:52.757 --> 17:56.135
His aorta's shredded.
It's not holding the sutures. Damn.

17:56.302 --> 18:00.932
He's had 14 units of blood,
two of FFP and six of platelets.

18:01.099 --> 18:04.477
- He's chewing up clotting factors.
- Retract this way. I can't see.

18:04.644 --> 18:06.146
- Where's Vucelich?
- Scrubbing in.

18:06.313 --> 18:08.941
BP's crashing.

18:09.108 --> 18:11.652
If only I could just-
Damn! Suction!

18:11.819 --> 18:14.154
- Suction!
- I've got an angle on it. Give it here.

18:14.321 --> 18:16.782
Gown me.

18:16.949 --> 18:21.621
Traumatic dissection of the aorta.
We elected to clamp-and-run.

18:21.788 --> 18:24.707
What were you débriding with, Benton?
Garden shears?

18:24.874 --> 18:27.335
It's hard to appreciate the degree-

18:27.502 --> 18:31.297
- I went the wrong way with this.
- Let me in, Benton. Get out of the way.

18:32.715 --> 18:34.676
Side clamp.

18:37.138 --> 18:39.640
The dissection is high
in the arch and posterior.

18:39.807 --> 18:42.435
2.0 Prolene, 24 inches.
Retract caudally.

18:42.601 --> 18:45.479
Should we go on bypass?

18:45.646 --> 18:48.149
No. I think we're okay now.

18:48.315 --> 18:51.694
It's my fault. I allowed Benton's
enthusiasm to cloud my judgment.

18:51.861 --> 18:54.197
All right. Tie it off here.

18:54.364 --> 18:56.825
No, no, that's too long. Yes, yes.

18:59.161 --> 19:01.163
Bovie there.

19:02.664 --> 19:04.749
Got it.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.210
Bovie that.

19:09.005 --> 19:10.840
No, tie that off.

19:11.132 --> 19:13.467
Okay, let's dissect this.

19:17.263 --> 19:19.223
Hey, Jeanie.

19:19.390 --> 19:21.392
- Is he still hanging around?
- Yeah.

19:21.559 --> 19:23.519
Dr. Carter! She's not responding.

19:23.687 --> 19:25.939
How long is she staying down here?

19:26.106 --> 19:28.400
Nobody wants her admitted
more than I do.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.653
- Carter, I need you.
- Her heart monitor beeped.

19:31.820 --> 19:34.781
It's supposed to.
Ruby, I got another patient.

19:34.948 --> 19:37.618
Ruby, let's take a look,
make sure everything's okay.

19:39.204 --> 19:43.041
Yeah. Another adolescent fantasy
shot to hell.

19:43.208 --> 19:46.044
- Nice knees.
- Guys, we get an 8-by-10 glossy...

19:46.211 --> 19:48.546
...none of us will ever work holidays again.

19:49.839 --> 19:53.218
Doug! Two boys hit by a car.
Paramedics are two minutes out.

19:53.384 --> 19:55.346
Man, I miss all the fun.

19:55.512 --> 19:57.473
- Come on, Carol.
- Why me?

19:57.640 --> 20:00.392
- I don't get to see, you don't.
- That's not fair!

20:00.559 --> 20:03.938
- Care to join me, Dr. Lewis?
- I'd be delighted, Dr. Greene.

20:06.231 --> 20:09.568
Mark, Susan, thank God!
I'm feeling a bit foolish.

20:09.735 --> 20:12.030
- No doubt.
- What's the problem?

20:12.197 --> 20:14.491
Showing off, tossing the caber.

20:14.658 --> 20:18.078
I clunked myself, the buffet table
and my great-aunt Jean Ferguson.

20:19.955 --> 20:22.958
- The caber?
- A big telephone-pole thing.

20:23.124 --> 20:26.879
You pick it up-
And it's not light, mind you...

20:27.046 --> 20:30.424
...and you flip it upside down,
or you try to.

20:30.591 --> 20:32.969
The Highland Games. Burns Supper.

20:33.803 --> 20:36.263
My leg's killing me.

20:36.430 --> 20:37.932
So...

20:38.641 --> 20:40.059
...that's a kilt?

20:40.226 --> 20:42.980
Of course it's a kilt!
What else...?

20:45.524 --> 20:49.027
I see what you're saying.
That would be embarrassing.

20:50.153 --> 20:51.863
Russian Jew on my father's side.

20:52.072 --> 20:54.533
Full-blooded Highland Scot
on my mother's.

20:56.034 --> 20:57.412
It's probably broken.

20:57.704 --> 20:59.205
Oh, damn!

20:59.789 --> 21:01.749
Hey, Jeanie.

21:02.417 --> 21:04.961
I hope you haven't gone through
a lot of trouble tonight.

21:05.128 --> 21:07.380
- Dinner's off.
- They canceled this late?

21:07.547 --> 21:10.717
No, no. I got a post-op
with a lot of complications.

21:10.883 --> 21:13.095
I'll be hung up here all night.
Sorry.

21:13.262 --> 21:15.222
Guess I'll cancel my makeover.

21:15.389 --> 21:18.183
That was a joke. Some other time.

21:18.350 --> 21:19.601
Yeah.

21:22.479 --> 21:24.231
Twofer. Brothers.
Noah's 9, Kenny's 7.

21:24.398 --> 21:27.317
Skitching from a bus. Kenny fell,
Noah let go. A car hit them.

21:27.484 --> 21:30.405
- Kenny's hurt bad!
- Okay, Noah. We'll take care of him.

21:30.572 --> 21:33.533
- Skitching?
- Hold on to a bumper and skate along.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.661
Kenny's dinged pretty badly.
Head trauma, ALOC.

21:36.828 --> 21:40.373
BP's 60/40, pulse 144.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.794
Probable femur fracture,
tire track on his abdomen.

21:43.961 --> 21:46.964
- Noah?
- Good vitals, maybe a fractured wrist.

21:47.131 --> 21:49.258
On my count. One, two, three.

21:49.425 --> 21:52.678
Let's get X-ray in here.
Portable C-spine, CBC...

21:52.845 --> 21:54.805
...type and cross six units.

21:54.972 --> 21:58.977
- Babinski's downgoing.
- BP's down, 50 palp. Pulse 150.

21:59.144 --> 22:01.229
Get two of O-negative down here, stat.

22:01.396 --> 22:03.940
Absent bowel sounds. Belly's rigid.

22:04.107 --> 22:06.193
Intubation tray. Excuse me.

22:06.359 --> 22:10.363
Uncuffed number 5 ET tube.
Stabilize his neck.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.741
- Good pulse.
- Head CT, non-contrast.

22:12.908 --> 22:16.245
I'll order a C-spine, chest,
pelvis, right femur.

22:16.954 --> 22:19.832
Set up for a peritoneal lavage,
please.

22:21.334 --> 22:23.294
I'll be next door.

22:23.461 --> 22:25.838
Who's on Pediatric Surgery?

22:26.672 --> 22:28.466
Calm down, Noah.
You're gonna be fine.

22:28.633 --> 22:31.637
Is Kenny gonna be okay?
Is he gonna die?

22:31.803 --> 22:34.890
- We're taking care of him, Noah.
- It's my fault.

22:35.057 --> 22:38.644
- How is he?
- He's lucky. Couple lacerations, road rash.

22:39.186 --> 22:42.397
- Left wrist fracture.
- Kenny, Kenny!

22:42.564 --> 22:45.025
Calm down.
Kenny has to have surgery.

22:45.193 --> 22:47.195
We need to know
where your parents are.

22:47.362 --> 22:49.864
- He is gonna die.
- Where're your parents?

22:50.448 --> 22:53.034
I don't know where my mom is.
Dad isn't around.

22:54.244 --> 22:56.079
I recognize this kid.

22:56.246 --> 22:58.706
- You've been here before?
- Don't let him die.

22:58.873 --> 23:00.960
We're prepped for the DPL.

23:01.126 --> 23:04.546
Noah, you need to calm down.
Try to remember where your dad is.

23:06.548 --> 23:08.884
We have to do this without
the parents' consent.

23:09.051 --> 23:12.888
Notify O.R. and the
Pediatric surgeon on call.

23:13.055 --> 23:16.184
O- neg at 20 per kg.
I figured 500 cc's.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.353
Sounds about right.

23:21.648 --> 23:23.733
Tap's positive.

23:26.236 --> 23:28.071
Dr. Carter.

23:28.238 --> 23:32.243
Could you explain what's going
on with my Sylvie to Dr. Goldstein?

23:32.410 --> 23:34.537
- Dr. Goldstein?
- Carter?

23:34.704 --> 23:37.665
He's the upstairs neighbor
of my sister in Miami.

23:37.832 --> 23:40.876
Get his number. I'll call him back.

23:41.043 --> 23:43.629
Carter!
Where's Vucelich's data sheets?

23:45.006 --> 23:47.884
- I'm not quite done yet.
- What the hell have you been doing?

23:48.051 --> 23:50.345
Trying to get Mrs. Rubadoux readmitted.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.056
Cardiology won't take her,
because no Ml was confirmed.

23:53.223 --> 23:58.478
She's one patient. Get her admitted
and finish Vucelich's data sheets, okay?

24:00.439 --> 24:03.234
Mrs. Dean. I'm Dr. Lewis.

24:03.401 --> 24:06.487
Lily tells me you took
your intubation tube out.

24:07.864 --> 24:11.826
We don't encourage that, but
I'll take it to mean you feel better.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.704
Like a million bucks.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.336
Your records contain a Do Not Resuscitate
order. I'd like to remove it.

24:22.546 --> 24:24.882
No. Leave it.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.384
You're in impending
respiratory failure.

24:28.886 --> 24:32.222
It's treatable, but we need
to put you on a respirator.

24:36.728 --> 24:39.564
Mrs. Dean, you're only 50 years old.

24:41.691 --> 24:45.779
Leave it. Leave it.

24:51.869 --> 24:53.829
It's not an emergency.

24:53.996 --> 24:57.041
I just wanted to tell him
I'm not coming to the dinner.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.336
Dr. Benton, are you ill?

25:00.503 --> 25:03.130
And by that, I mean do you
have a terminal disease...

25:03.297 --> 25:06.176
...to which you will succumb
before 11:00 tonight?

25:07.135 --> 25:11.848
Then I suggest you arrive promptly
at 8 and enjoy your evening.

25:12.015 --> 25:15.393
- I'm not sure he wants me to come.
- Of course he wants you.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.938
You're filling in
for a last-minute cancellation.

25:18.104 --> 25:20.566
Marian doesn't like
empty chairs at dinner parties.

25:20.733 --> 25:22.568
Think of it this way:

25:22.735 --> 25:24.695
His dinners are like his surgeries.

25:24.862 --> 25:27.532
When your presence is requested,
you don't decline.

25:32.245 --> 25:34.747
- Any word from my wife?
- On her way.

25:34.914 --> 25:37.543
Is someone poking out
a cat's eye in there?

25:37.709 --> 25:40.045
I told him it was okay to practice.

25:46.468 --> 25:49.638
It looks like a non-displaced
fracture of the distal fibula.

25:49.805 --> 25:51.724
- Damn.
- You're gonna need a cast.

25:51.891 --> 25:55.645
I'm gonna miss the haggis.
The boys will be disappointed.

25:55.812 --> 25:59.148
- I'll call Ortho.
- I was supposed to cut it.

25:59.315 --> 26:03.361
Great honor. The nephews
were gonna pipe me in and everything.

26:03.528 --> 26:06.614
Even memorized Robbie Burns'
"To a Haggis. "

26:13.622 --> 26:15.833
This is Greene in the ER.

26:27.512 --> 26:29.681
- Dinner's back on.
- Excuse me?

26:29.848 --> 26:32.684
I can make it after all,
if that's cool with you.

26:32.851 --> 26:34.853
Sure, yeah. I'll see you later.

26:39.275 --> 26:42.528
- Hey, Rach! How's it going?
- Okay.

26:42.695 --> 26:45.406
Your mom will be here
real soon to pick you up.

26:46.532 --> 26:48.868
- So who's winning?
- She is.

26:49.035 --> 26:51.746
- She's good too.
- Thanks for watching her.

26:51.912 --> 26:53.874
Hey, no problem. I had four sisters.

26:54.041 --> 26:57.044
- Mark, can I steal you for a consult?
- Sure.

26:57.210 --> 26:58.795
I'll be back in a second.

26:58.962 --> 27:02.883
- No, you won't.
- I'll back as soon as I can.

27:04.551 --> 27:08.638
I remembered him. His father was in
with respiratory and liver problems.

27:08.806 --> 27:10.767
Passed out in his own vomit.

27:10.933 --> 27:14.020
- Noah called 911 and saved him.
- Father of the Year candidate.

27:14.187 --> 27:16.647
He's been in six times in two years.
He's a real mess.

27:16.814 --> 27:18.775
The DCFS guy's here.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.903
Dad's a drunk, kids are
playing outside on a school day.

27:22.070 --> 27:25.074
Who says the American family
is in decline? How you doing?

27:25.240 --> 27:28.368
So how long will it take you
to get these kids out of the home?

27:28.535 --> 27:31.872
Dave Donovan. Nice to meet you too.

27:32.039 --> 27:35.375
Their mother's MIA. Dad's been
on a bender for three years.

27:35.542 --> 27:38.420
He's cleaned up pretty well now.
AA, job.

27:38.587 --> 27:40.548
How's Kenny?

27:40.715 --> 27:45.011
Ruptured spleen, concussion,
fractured thigh. He's gonna be okay.

27:45.178 --> 27:46.221
And Noah?

27:46.387 --> 27:49.432
We'll admit him until you find him
a placement. Come on.

27:49.599 --> 27:51.810
Not looking for one.
Father's on his way in.

27:51.976 --> 27:54.562
So what?
The father lets his kids run wild.

27:54.729 --> 27:59.109
- They're boys, screwed up. Played hooky.
- No, no, the father screwed up.

27:59.276 --> 28:01.237
Yeah. Maybe, maybe not.

28:02.112 --> 28:03.781
So that's all you're gonna do.

28:03.989 --> 28:05.950
- Let's just wait and see.
- Okay.

28:07.117 --> 28:09.119
- John, hold on!
- I'm in a hurry.

28:09.286 --> 28:10.914
- This will only take a sec.
- Okay.

28:11.081 --> 28:14.167
You haven't told Rubadoux
his wife's condition is serious.

28:14.334 --> 28:17.838
- I tried. I couldn't get a word in.
- He needs to know so he can say goodbye.

28:18.004 --> 28:20.423
- Why does it have to be me?
- He trusts you.

28:20.590 --> 28:23.510
- I have to go.
- Just do it.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.306
Karen Hardy. She's
been there about 20 minutes.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.517
Her mother signed a DNR order.

28:29.684 --> 28:33.145
She hasn't budged. I'm afraid
she may challenge the order.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.482
- Mrs. Hardy, this is Dr. Greene.
- Hi.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.985
This would be a good time to see her.

28:39.151 --> 28:42.155
No, thanks.
This glass between us is just fine.

28:44.116 --> 28:46.451
Your mother's condition
is very grave.

28:46.618 --> 28:49.246
We can't be sure she'll pull through.

28:49.413 --> 28:53.041
- Did she ask to see me?
- No.

28:55.335 --> 28:58.673
No. She only ever wants to see
the bottom of a bottle of booze.

28:58.840 --> 29:03.136
Your mother is dying and she's asked
that no measures be taken to save her life.

29:03.303 --> 29:05.722
You understand the implications
of her request?

29:06.472 --> 29:07.849
She wants to die.

29:08.558 --> 29:11.311
She can't face the truth
that she's an alcoholic.

29:12.020 --> 29:13.605
Never admit that.

29:14.189 --> 29:16.150
I don't know why
parents lie to their kids.

29:16.317 --> 29:18.610
Children know.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.113
Always.

29:22.114 --> 29:24.825
If there's a chance to make peace,
you should talk to her.

29:25.534 --> 29:27.161
I don't want to see her.

29:27.328 --> 29:31.541
I believe you. But you have been
standing there for 20 minutes.

29:33.710 --> 29:36.338
You said there were some papers
I should sign.

29:37.172 --> 29:38.715
Yeah, they're at the desk.

29:45.389 --> 29:48.392
Rheumatology, no. Orthopedics, no.

29:48.559 --> 29:49.977
What are you doing?

29:50.144 --> 29:52.355
Trying to find a study
to take Mrs. Rubadoux.

29:52.521 --> 29:55.900
Neurology. Bingo!

29:56.484 --> 29:58.319
Dr. Carter...

29:58.611 --> 30:02.407
This is Carter in the ER. I've got a patient
for your nerve-stimulation study.

30:02.574 --> 30:05.077
Post-op ischemic myelopathy.

30:05.243 --> 30:06.995
You'll see her?

30:07.162 --> 30:10.624
You'll have to hurry.
Cardiology is interested too.

30:10.791 --> 30:12.918
All right, I'll save her for you.

30:13.919 --> 30:17.340
She's admitted. Neurology. They're on
their way down to see her now.

30:17.507 --> 30:19.467
You'll still be her doctor, right?

30:19.634 --> 30:22.512
I'll visit, but I'm assigned
to the Surgical service.

30:22.678 --> 30:26.057
But the Neurology people
are the ones to help her?

30:26.224 --> 30:29.602
- That's right.
- And she's gonna be okay?

30:29.769 --> 30:32.272
They're the people to see. Neuro.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.441
Bye now. God bless.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.656
Thanks, Malik.
I've got a couple of minutes.

30:40.823 --> 30:42.825
Hey, no problem.

30:43.325 --> 30:44.952
Rach?

30:45.119 --> 30:48.498
You and I, we need to talk.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.752
Now, you know...

30:52.919 --> 30:55.088
...that you will always have...

30:55.255 --> 30:58.925
...a mom and a dad
who love you very much.

30:59.092 --> 31:01.720
See my fish?

31:02.805 --> 31:04.807
When you move back home...

31:04.974 --> 31:08.769
...can we get another angelfish
to keep Moby company?

31:09.979 --> 31:13.148
Yes. Moby can have a new friend.

31:15.150 --> 31:17.529
But Daddy's not moving back home.

31:21.408 --> 31:23.368
The truth is...

31:23.535 --> 31:26.580
...you are gonna have
two homes from now on.

31:26.746 --> 31:30.083
One with Mommy, one with me.

31:30.709 --> 31:34.505
Mommy and Daddy aren't
gonna live together anymore.

31:36.465 --> 31:38.467
I know you're sad...

31:39.051 --> 31:41.178
...and angry.

31:42.555 --> 31:46.350
But I want you to talk to me
about anything, okay?

31:53.442 --> 31:55.861
Believe me...

31:56.028 --> 32:00.032
...Daddy wishes it could be
any other way than this.

32:02.534 --> 32:04.203
Hey, Jen.

32:04.370 --> 32:06.873
Rach and I,
we were having a talk.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.625
That's good, Mark.

32:08.791 --> 32:11.753
Hey, bananafish! I'm sorry I'm late.

32:11.919 --> 32:13.880
Mommy got her cast off today.

32:14.047 --> 32:16.382
- Let's pack up your stuff and go.
- No!

32:17.383 --> 32:18.509
Come on, honey.

32:18.676 --> 32:20.721
You can do lanyards in the car.

32:20.888 --> 32:22.556
- Stop it!
- Put your knapsack on.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.350
Get away!

32:24.892 --> 32:26.852
- No, no, no.
- That's enough.

32:27.019 --> 32:30.147
- Don't talk to your mother like that.
- I don't want to go! No!

32:30.314 --> 32:33.859
- Here you go.
- I don't want to go!

32:34.026 --> 32:36.571
- Come on, baby.
- Get away. Get away!

32:36.738 --> 32:39.115
I don't want to go! No!

32:39.282 --> 32:43.119
- Upsy.
- Get away! I don't want to go!

32:44.120 --> 32:47.415
No! Get away!

33:10.315 --> 33:13.110
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm Peter Benton.

33:13.276 --> 33:16.113
- Peter, I'm Marian Vucelich.
- Nice to meet you.

33:16.279 --> 33:19.950
- My guest should be arriving soon.
- She is already here.

33:20.117 --> 33:23.162
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Sure.

33:28.709 --> 33:32.421
- I thought your plans changed again.
- Yeah. Traffic was bad.

33:32.588 --> 33:34.882
- You look nice.
- So do you.

33:35.049 --> 33:36.635
Ladies and gentlemen.

33:37.094 --> 33:39.763
Looks like everyone's finally arrived.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.515
So...

33:42.474 --> 33:43.725
...dinner is served.

33:43.892 --> 33:45.853
Mr. Krawcyzk, I'm Dr. Ross.

33:46.019 --> 33:48.981
- How's Kenny? When can I see him?
- He's still in surgery.

33:49.148 --> 33:52.193
- But he's gonna be all right?
- Yes. Can I talk to you out here?

33:52.360 --> 33:55.530
- Yeah, sure.
- Excuse us.

34:00.243 --> 34:02.203
Why aren't these kids in school?

34:02.370 --> 34:05.206
- I talked to the social worker...
- Indulge me.

34:05.373 --> 34:08.210
I usually take them,
but I got a new job this week.

34:08.377 --> 34:10.337
They're supposed to take the bus.

34:10.504 --> 34:12.422
How'd you lose your old job?

34:12.590 --> 34:15.384
I quit when they put me
on nights. It's none-

34:15.592 --> 34:19.013
It's my business when these boys
are brought to the ER.

34:19.179 --> 34:22.141
- They'll be punished.
- They've been punished enough.

34:22.308 --> 34:24.518
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know what-

34:24.686 --> 34:27.688
How many times
have you been in here drunk?

34:27.856 --> 34:30.150
- Doug.
- How many times have you been in drunk?

34:30.317 --> 34:32.360
- What the hell are you doing?
- My job.

34:32.527 --> 34:35.487
This guy was circling the drain.
I think he's trying.

34:35.655 --> 34:37.908
- People don't change.
- Sure they do.

34:38.074 --> 34:42.914
If you wanna beat up on a father, call your
own. This guy's doing the best he can.

34:47.501 --> 34:50.170
- How are you feeling?
- Disappointed.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.632
They'll be cutting the haggis about now.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.679
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah, I hear that.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.565
My boys!

35:08.732 --> 35:11.277
My nephews!

35:22.330 --> 35:24.332
This is great!

35:28.504 --> 35:30.631
- Those are his nephews?
- Fergus!

35:30.798 --> 35:35.386
A Scotsman loves a man
who never gives up.

35:36.261 --> 35:37.513
Here's to you, Uncle Davey.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.515
The haggis!

35:40.475 --> 35:42.227
We couldn't do it without you,
Uncle Davey.

35:42.394 --> 35:43.728
You do the cutting.

35:43.895 --> 35:46.314
His knife see rustic labor dight

35:46.481 --> 35:48.942
And cut you up with ready sight

35:49.359 --> 35:52.696
Trenching your gushing entrails bright
Like onie ditch

35:52.862 --> 35:55.281
And then, O what a glorious sight

35:55.448 --> 35:59.370
Warm, reeking, rich
Let's eat!

36:02.081 --> 36:03.749
Oh, bless you!

36:09.630 --> 36:11.466
What is this?

36:11.633 --> 36:14.636
Sheep's blood, intestines
and testicles mixed in a gruel.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.226
- Mrs. Hardy.
- Hi.

36:23.562 --> 36:25.814
Are you all right?

36:28.025 --> 36:30.903
I used to watch her like this
when I was little.

36:31.070 --> 36:33.823
Passed out on the sofa...

36:33.990 --> 36:36.409
...kitchen floor, front steps.

36:36.576 --> 36:39.454
I never waited around long enough
for her to wake up.

36:40.621 --> 36:43.584
Too afraid when I was a child...

36:43.750 --> 36:45.752
...too angry later on.

36:48.297 --> 36:51.300
I don't seem to have the energy
for fear or anger.

36:53.677 --> 36:56.013
I can't decide
if that's a good sign or not.

36:57.764 --> 36:59.726
Here's to arteriosclerosis...

36:59.893 --> 37:02.187
...without which
I could not be offering you...

37:02.353 --> 37:05.398
...this exquisite
'85 Corton-Charlemagne.

37:05.565 --> 37:08.902
Beware. The last time
Carl uncorked a bottle...

37:09.068 --> 37:11.905
...I'd bought 5%
of his miracle drug, Lazerol...

37:12.071 --> 37:15.075
...by the end of the evening.

37:15.451 --> 37:17.995
I'm Anne Adelstein.
I don't believe we've met.

37:18.204 --> 37:19.580
I'm Peter Benton.

37:19.747 --> 37:22.541
I've read your work on dialysis.
It was impressive.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.877
My husband, Martin.

37:26.378 --> 37:29.549
- Are you the visiting Ortho fellow?
- No, darling.

37:29.716 --> 37:31.843
He's Carl's newly anointed.

37:32.010 --> 37:34.554
Yes. The chosen one.

37:34.721 --> 37:38.391
- The heir apparent.
- Carl has an eye for talent.

37:40.101 --> 37:41.561
To the heir apparent.

37:43.605 --> 37:45.399
Not after this afternoon.

37:45.566 --> 37:49.487
- Why? What happened?
- I made a fool out of myself in surgery.

37:49.654 --> 37:53.074
Vucelich was too polite to kick me
off the team before dinner.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.242
Sorry.

37:57.411 --> 37:59.372
Jeanie?

37:59.538 --> 38:01.500
Where's the truffle?

38:03.460 --> 38:06.296
You got me. Maybe there.

38:26.943 --> 38:29.487
- Thanks again for a lovely evening.
- Our pleasure.

38:29.654 --> 38:31.657
- Bye.
- Thank you.

38:36.286 --> 38:39.289
- Quite the evening.
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:39.456 --> 38:41.709
- I had a good time.
- Me too.

38:42.793 --> 38:45.295
- Well...
- Peter!

38:46.589 --> 38:48.550
Peter, do you have a moment?

38:48.717 --> 38:50.677
- Of course.
- Good.

38:50.844 --> 38:53.179
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:58.476 --> 39:03.274
Doctor. Dr. Lewis, please.
There's something wrong.

39:05.401 --> 39:09.363
Her pulse ox is down to 70.
She's in respiratory failure.

39:09.530 --> 39:12.116
- What's wrong?
- Heart rate's down to 40.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.535
Dobutamine and dopamine are maxed.

39:15.911 --> 39:17.246
Do something!

39:17.414 --> 39:20.167
Your mother signed
a Do Not Resuscitate order.

39:20.333 --> 39:22.669
You have to help her!

39:22.836 --> 39:25.839
Breathing's agonal.
No BP. Pulse down to 30.

39:27.424 --> 39:29.426
Aren't you gonna do anything?

39:30.719 --> 39:33.598
We have to respect her wishes.
She was very clear.

40:07.050 --> 40:10.845
- Brandy, or shall we have port?
- I don't drink.

40:11.012 --> 40:15.225
Don't drink? Well, how are you
going to enjoy your Cohiba?

40:16.226 --> 40:17.685
Castro's favorite.

40:17.852 --> 40:20.272
Rolled on the thighs of virgins.

40:20.439 --> 40:22.566
I don't- I don't smoke either.

40:22.733 --> 40:26.820
Please, Peter. You're contributing
to the appalling demise of social ritual.

40:26.987 --> 40:28.948
I tell you what.

40:29.114 --> 40:31.450
Let me just put this beside you.

40:32.576 --> 40:35.622
It will make me feel so much better.

40:38.667 --> 40:41.294
I'm sorry about
this afternoon's surgery.

40:41.461 --> 40:44.673
I know it was disappointing for you.
It was for me.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.175
It was.

40:47.342 --> 40:49.970
Dr. Hicks was absolutely right.

40:50.136 --> 40:53.349
- I did overstep my bounds.
- You did.

40:54.517 --> 40:56.352
That's exactly what I expect of you.

40:57.561 --> 40:59.772
Angela Hicks is a superb surgeon.

40:59.939 --> 41:02.942
I've never known her
to make a significant error.

41:03.109 --> 41:05.736
But the physician
that is useful to me...

41:05.903 --> 41:08.615
...is the one who keeps
one eye on the details...

41:08.782 --> 41:11.868
...while the other eye
roams the horizons.

41:12.953 --> 41:14.746
To me, medicine is a challenge.

41:15.789 --> 41:17.541
It's full of highly-skilled drudgery.

41:17.708 --> 41:20.335
There are plenty
of talented surgeons out there...

41:20.502 --> 41:24.132
...who simply perfect the practice of
what has already been accomplished.

41:24.298 --> 41:29.637
My interest lies beyond that.
The impossibles, the risks.

41:29.804 --> 41:31.973
That's why it's been
an honor to work with you.

41:32.140 --> 41:34.142
Is it? Really?

41:36.644 --> 41:39.982
To be honest, I haven't been able
to tell whether you like it or not.

41:40.149 --> 41:43.068
Believe me, it's been the best
and hardest work I've ever done.

41:43.235 --> 41:46.071
Good. Good.

41:46.238 --> 41:47.823
That's music to my ears.

41:47.990 --> 41:52.244
I'd begun to fear that I saw something
in you that you didn't see in yourself.

41:54.664 --> 41:56.416
I want to see it.

41:57.459 --> 41:59.127
I'll drink to that.

42:24.279 --> 42:26.656
Hello? Who is this?

42:31.286 --> 42:33.246
What are you doing sitting in the dark?

42:33.413 --> 42:35.290
Don't ask.

42:38.376 --> 42:39.712
Mind if I join you?

42:46.886 --> 42:49.889
- Tough day, guys?
- Don't ask.

42:50.056 --> 42:53.809
Would a little single malt
Glendronach help?

42:53.976 --> 42:58.482
I don't know. We'd have to do
a linear-regression analysis.

42:58.649 --> 43:01.235
Well, the regression part's guaranteed.

43:03.445 --> 43:07.991
- Do we have anything to eat?
- I think there's some haggis left over.

43:08.158 --> 43:11.496
- What's that?
- Don't ask.

43:13.957 --> 43:15.500
Cheers!

43:19.671 --> 43:21.589
Dr. Carter.

43:21.756 --> 43:24.092
I'm buried, Ruby.

43:24.259 --> 43:26.554
I've got all this data to tabulate...

43:26.720 --> 43:30.182
...I've got pre-op histories to dictate,
a. m. labs to order.

43:36.605 --> 43:38.565
You lied to me.

43:39.233 --> 43:40.442
What?

43:40.609 --> 43:43.613
The neurologist told me
she'll never leave the hospital.

43:46.616 --> 43:49.703
He's your doctor now.
You should respect his opinion.

43:51.579 --> 43:54.332
- You knew all along.
- I gotta get back to work.

43:54.499 --> 43:57.420
You were our doctor! And our friend!

43:57.586 --> 43:59.547
No, I was a fourth-year medical student...

43:59.714 --> 44:02.383
...who took care of your wife
on the Surgical service.

44:02.550 --> 44:05.761
You gave me hope
because I thought you cared.

44:06.804 --> 44:08.931
- You should have told me the truth.
- I tried.

44:09.098 --> 44:12.019
I'm not a kid!
You should have told me.

44:13.812 --> 44:16.565
Did her leaving the hospital
today make her worse?

44:18.233 --> 44:20.235
I don't know.

44:23.196 --> 44:25.240
I trusted you.

44:25.407 --> 44:28.161
I spent two weeks treating
her multiple medical problems.

44:28.327 --> 44:31.873
I dealt with Social Services
and arranged for her convalescent care.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.334
I fought with Renal and Neuro to get
her admitted here. I did all I could.

44:36.085 --> 44:37.837
We're not just old people.

44:38.004 --> 44:39.922
We have lives.

44:40.089 --> 44:42.884
You look at my wife
and just see her problems.

44:43.677 --> 44:46.346
I see a 20-year-old dancer.

44:47.181 --> 44:49.516
A 27-year-old bride.

44:49.683 --> 44:51.852
- A 30-year-old mother...
- What do you want from me?

44:52.019 --> 44:54.021
- The truth!
- She's dying, Ruby!

44:54.188 --> 44:56.190
Is that what you wanna hear?

44:56.356 --> 44:58.568
She's never gonna leave this hospital.

45:00.779 --> 45:02.447
Thank you!

45:04.032 --> 45:06.076
I'm sorry, Ruby.

45:06.242 --> 45:08.328
Call me Mr. Rubadoux.
