- Previously on "Colony"...

00:09.077 --> 00:10.278
- I'll believe you
if you tell me

00:10.311 --> 00:11.545
that this was
your wife's mistake

00:11.579 --> 00:12.546
and not yours.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.582
- I knew nothing about this.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.451
There is a special shipment
coming through your camp.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.287
It's headed off-planet.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.690
- Did you ever have contact
with the leader of the cell?

00:22.723 --> 00:24.558
- Yes.
- Her name is Karen.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.726
Frankie's mother.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.195
- I know you took the file.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.163
- I didn't take anything
from your house.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.365
- Bowman is working
for the Resistance.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.368
[gunshot]

00:35.769 --> 00:37.471
- There is a growing
resistance movement

00:37.505 --> 00:38.472
outside the colony.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.074
- What if this was an attempt

00:40.108 --> 00:41.742
to recover
our Hosts' missing gauntlet

00:41.775 --> 00:44.078
and take it beyond our walls?

00:44.112 --> 00:45.479
- I made contact with the pilot.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.348
- I represent a resistance group

00:47.381 --> 00:48.382
based outside the colony.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.184
I'm here
because the real war

00:50.218 --> 00:52.086
is about to begin,

00:52.120 --> 00:54.155
and that thing you stole,
it's gonna help us win it.

Motion sensor just tripped.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.255

Cover the doors.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.422
- Got it.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.423
[suspenseful music]

01:29.457 --> 01:31.225

There.
Put it on.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.269
Have your ID ready
when you get in there!

03:26.540 --> 03:28.409
- Thank you.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.644
- In troubled times,
you can always turn to family.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.880
That's what
the Greatest Day is all about.

03:32.913 --> 03:33.881
Family.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.283
- Good luck to you.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.550
- Over here, please.

[camera shutter clicking]
Smile.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.921
- That's good.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.790
- Our numbers keep exploding.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.558
- I saw the report.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.028
People are seeing the value
in participation, aren't they?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.763
- Well,
the ration kits don't hurt.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.399
- Yeah, I'm gonna
keep pulling strings,

03:51.432 --> 03:53.367
dig up as many as I can.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.670
I think it's important people
see us taking care of our own.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.772
- I'm gonna find a bathroom
before we head up the hill.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.441

[suspenseful music]

04:15.723 --> 04:17.291
- You shouldn't be here.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.059
- You heard what happened.
- Of course I did.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.428
They called Nolan.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.729
- I want you to get Hudson
and meet me.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.063
We'll get you underground.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.334
- What?
- They're gonna come for you.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.801
- That's ridiculous.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.470
They won't blame me
for your bad choices.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.539
- Of course they will.
It's what they do.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.407
- Nolan won't let them.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.943
- Stop deluding yourself.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.679
That man threw away his wife.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.048
You really think
he's gonna stand up for you?

04:43.751 --> 04:46.420
Come with me.
We're leaving the bloc.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.323
- Jesus, Katie.
Think about your children.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.692
- That's exactly what I'm doing.
- No, you're not.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.860
You're thinking about yourself,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.562
just like when
you stole that file.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.697
- The file is the whole reason
you need to leave the bloc.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.432
The population numbers
are absolutely--

04:58.466 --> 05:00.000
- So you admit it.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.469
The only reason I'm in trouble

05:01.502 --> 05:04.372
is because
of the things you did.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.747
- If you're wrong about Nolan
and you need my help,

05:13.781 --> 05:15.449
tie a shoelace
to the streetlight

05:15.483 --> 05:17.918
outside the Yonk,
and I'll make contact.

05:20.621 --> 05:24.392
*

05:24.425 --> 05:25.993
- What's it like out there?

05:26.026 --> 05:28.862
- Lawless.
And empty.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.599
They scooped up a lot of people

05:31.632 --> 05:33.501
when they walled up
the big cities,

05:33.534 --> 05:35.769
and then they have
big drone walkers

05:35.803 --> 05:39.072
that break up
any major settlement,

05:39.106 --> 05:41.509
so most of the survivors
are scattered.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.043
- Sounds like the wild west.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.545
- Yeah, basically.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.046
- And your group?

05:46.079 --> 05:50.751
- Some pros found each other,
and we started reaching out.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.654
We have a secure location
in the desert.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.156
- And you can do something
with the gauntlet.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.891
- We have someone
who understands

05:57.925 --> 05:59.560
the alien interface.

05:59.593 --> 06:03.030
We just need a device to be able
to communicate with them.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.566
- The gauntlet controlled
a drone.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.834
- Where is it?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.539
- The resistance group
that murdered Hennessey,

06:11.572 --> 06:12.840
they stole it.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.944
I gave it to him
because there was heat on me.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.412
- Who took it?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.714
- A group called the Red Hand.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.417
- I want to meet them.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.586
- That's not advisable.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.088
- I came a long way
to collect that thing.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.824
I'm not going back without it.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.860
- You have to get out
of the bloc first.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.996
If I get you through the Wall,

06:36.029 --> 06:38.566
you take us back to your group.

06:38.599 --> 06:45.606
*

06:56.884 --> 06:58.418
- I.D. please.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.433
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

07:32.786 --> 07:34.154
- I'm here
on behalf of Helena Goldwyn,

07:34.187 --> 07:35.989
the Governor-General.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.660
She's concerned
that you aren't getting

07:39.693 --> 07:43.631
the support that you need
from Proxy Alcala.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.666
- We have everything we need.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.603
- Of course.
We just want you to know

07:49.637 --> 07:53.140
that you have
our full cooperation.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.147
- Wait.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.217
You were the former proxy.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.888
- Yes.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.891
- You personally hired
Will Bowman.

08:10.924 --> 08:15.563
Why would somebody at your level
get involved in such a decision?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.832
- We needed the help,

08:18.866 --> 08:22.570
and I thought
that he was a special candidate.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.855
- Did you get to her?

08:41.889 --> 08:44.625
- We talked.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.764
- I'm sorry.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.567
- Where's the pilot?

08:53.601 --> 08:56.570
- Trying to get the gauntlet
back from the Red Hand.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.238
- She got some balls on her.
I give her that.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.607
- Is there a plan

08:59.640 --> 09:01.108
if she actually manages
to do it?

09:01.141 --> 09:04.077
- If we get her out of the bloc,
we can go with her.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.147
- You know a way out of here?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.083
- Tunnels, maybe.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.952
- Occupation
has been sealing them.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.288
- Any other ideas?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.058
- I might know a guy.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.137
- What's going on?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.239
You haven't said a word
since church.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.008
- It's Katie.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.210
I don't want us to pay
for her mistakes.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.881
- I told you,
I talked to Alcala.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.650
You just got to make a statement
to Homeland,

09:42.683 --> 09:45.719
and then we can put
this whole business behind us.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.788
- I hope so.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.160
Will you have lunch with us?

09:53.193 --> 09:56.063
- Yeah. I think I will.
I just have to call the office.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.798
[suspenseful music]

09:57.831 --> 09:59.132
- Ms. Kenner.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.400
I am from
the Global Authority's

10:00.433 --> 10:02.402
Intelligence Directorate.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.138
We have some questions for you.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.807
*

10:06.840 --> 10:08.709
Come with me.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.084
.

10:17.117 --> 10:17.517
- After the Arrival,

10:19.152 --> 10:21.188
you were living
in your sister's guest house.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.825
- I have a diabetic son.
I was desperate.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.994
- So you were depending on her?

10:28.228 --> 10:31.331
- We went
our separate directions.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.333
I was fortunate enough
to find Nolan,

10:33.366 --> 10:36.136
which led me
to a role in the Greatest Day.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.773
- You worked
a series of menial jobs

10:39.807 --> 10:41.208
in the Green Zone

10:41.241 --> 10:43.410
until you leveraged
your knowledge of art

10:43.443 --> 10:46.714
into a position
with Mr. Burgess' wife.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.116
Then you took her place.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.855
- Nolan has changed my life.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.757
I love him.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.227
- We know
from one of your servants

11:00.260 --> 11:02.195
that your sister was here
at the house

11:02.229 --> 11:05.766
on the day the file
was illegally downloaded.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.769
[suspenseful music]

11:08.802 --> 11:12.339
*

11:12.372 --> 11:14.241
- My sister did steal that file.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.477
I know that now,
but I was horrified.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.479
I confronted her.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.082
- Yet you did not go
to the authorities.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.416
Why?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.956
- Because I wasn't sure.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.291
And I couldn't send
my sister and her family

11:31.324 --> 11:34.361
to the Factory if I wasn't sure.

11:37.965 --> 11:41.268
- You are a convincing liar.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.270
*

11:43.303 --> 11:45.372
- Are you drawing horns
on her like that?

11:45.405 --> 11:47.207
That's very good.
[knocking]

11:47.240 --> 11:48.809
Be right back.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.081
Hi.
- Hi. It's Toby, right?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.983
- Yeah. What can I do for you?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.021
- Inside.
You're fine.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.390
You're fine.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.965
- Howard Anderson.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.301
- What is--
- Your husband.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.468
Where is he?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.807
- Changing.
He'll be out in a...

12:20.808 --> 12:22.109
Howard!

12:22.142 --> 12:23.844
[door opens]

12:26.479 --> 12:27.881
Howard!

12:34.087 --> 12:35.288
- Sit.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.408
- Look,
we don't want any trouble.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.847
Do you need supplies?
Food? Whatever you want.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.451
- Information.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.820
- Anything.

13:06.854 --> 13:10.824
Just, please,
leave them out of this.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.392
What do you want to know?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.227
- You run the Downtown Gateway.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.030
- I'm just a shift supervisor.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.465
- We need to know
how the protocols work

13:18.498 --> 13:20.233
in the transit zones.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.836
- We need to know
how to get through the Wall.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.605
- I can't help you.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.108
The Gateways
are a very complex system.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.110
Lots of built-in redundancies.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.579
Even if I cleared you
on my side,

13:32.612 --> 13:34.381
another officer
would have to clear you

13:34.414 --> 13:36.316
through a second checkpoint.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.452
- Who?

13:41.922 --> 13:45.092
- I--
I've never even seen their face.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.494
They come out
of a different barracks.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.929
Look.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.230
Getting through
an exclusion zone

13:50.263 --> 13:52.165
used to be hard,
but now it's impossible.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.466
There's virtually no traffic

13:53.500 --> 13:55.068
since they shut down
the labor camps.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.570
It's just
one long graveyard shift.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.573
Like I tell Toby every day.
Don't I?

14:00.607 --> 14:03.877
- What about the VIPs?
They get the same treatment?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.512
- Oh, yeah.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.580
Even the Governor-General's
convoy gets the full nine.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.383
Heat scans.
Walk-arounds. Sniffer dogs.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.186
The only ones that get through
are the Blackjacks.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.654
- Who?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.257
- These men in black.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.591
Nobody really knows
that much about them,

14:18.625 --> 14:20.593
so we just call 'em
"Blackjacks."

14:20.627 --> 14:22.629
- They work for the IGA.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.065
The group above the proxy
and Governor-General.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.267
- These Blackjacks.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.402
They can get through
without being stopped?

14:29.436 --> 14:32.039
- They have a transponder
or something in their car

14:32.072 --> 14:34.274
that lets 'em get through
without any interference.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.542
My buddy got in trouble

14:35.575 --> 14:38.045
for asking them
too many questions once.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.546
He...

14:41.681 --> 14:45.385
So now we just back off
and shut up and let 'em pass.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.424
- You seem like a smart guy.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.493
I'm sure you understand
that reporting our visit

14:53.526 --> 14:56.463
will just get your family
dragged down to Interrogation.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.332
- Believe me,
I don't want any trouble.

14:59.366 --> 15:06.406
*

15:08.108 --> 15:09.142
- Thanks for your time.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.659
- Sir?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.162
You're expected outside.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.110
- Step into my office, Nolan.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.245
- Is everything all right?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.283
- You're dating
the sister of a terrorist.

15:50.317 --> 15:54.154
- It's not like that.
- Really?

15:54.187 --> 15:56.123
Then, explain it to me.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.958
- Maddie...

16:00.493 --> 16:04.097
Look, she's got nothing to do
with the Resistance.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.298
Would you want to be blamed

16:05.332 --> 16:07.667
for everyone
in your family tree?

16:07.700 --> 16:10.137
- Helena is maneuvering
against me,

16:10.170 --> 16:13.140
and I can't afford
to hand her any ammunition.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.707
- I'll fix it.

16:14.741 --> 16:18.745
- By walking in there
and disavowing that woman.

16:20.547 --> 16:24.717
- Are you questioning
my commitment?

16:26.619 --> 16:29.589
Because I sent my wife
to the Factory.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.058
*

16:31.091 --> 16:32.792
- You and I built
something here.

16:57.284 --> 16:57.484
.

16:57.517 --> 16:57.917
- Is that a drone?

17:00.153 --> 17:01.588
- Yeah.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.357
We're trying to get
our own eye in the sky.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.593
- That's cool.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.632
You don't really look
like someone

17:12.665 --> 17:14.367
who'd be in the Resistance.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.836
- Why?
'Cause I'm not Sarah Connor?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.339
- Uh...
- I'm kidding.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.473
You're right.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.509
Eckhart convinced us
to bug Homeland,

17:22.542 --> 17:24.577
which seemed like more
of a stunt than anything else,

17:24.611 --> 17:26.779
and then we met Broussard,
and...

17:28.281 --> 17:30.049
Now I'm here.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.089
Guess that's life.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.758
At times, it just puts you
on unexpected roads.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.262
- Yeah.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.202
Why don't they let you go
outside with them?

17:51.138 --> 17:53.673
- 'Cause I'm not
fully trained yet.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.608
- Does that bother you?
- Nope.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.112
I know exactly what I can do
and what I can't.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.647
- I could help them.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.315
I know a bunch of stuff,

18:02.349 --> 18:04.517
but they're never
gonna give me the chance.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.420
- Yeah, but you're their kid.
- It's not just that.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.791
They don't trust me.

18:11.824 --> 18:15.295
*

18:15.328 --> 18:16.829
- Give it time.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.767
- What do you know
about these Blackjacks?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.502
- Not much.
Nobody does.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.837
They showed up
after you abducted the RAP.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.240
I think they're trying
to recover the gauntlet.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.575
- So we steal their car

18:28.608 --> 18:31.444
and use the transponder
to get through the Wall.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.480
- Yeah, that should be easy.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.482
- These guys are good?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.717
- Cream of the crop.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.822
- Only way to do it
is an ambush.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.625
But we don't know
their base of operations.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.926
Their habits.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.861
Where they report.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.733
- They're in the bloc
looking for you.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.203
Well, us.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.804
- We could be the bait.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.840

19:19.992 --> 19:22.429
So, you've come back
to the bloc.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.298
- I have.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.369
- In what capacity?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.539
- I'm doing some fact-finding

19:32.572 --> 19:35.642
on behalf
of the Governor-General.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.712
I'm interested
in Will Bowman's disappearance

19:39.746 --> 19:41.681
and his possible connection
to Broussard

19:41.714 --> 19:43.383
and the missing artifact.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.985
- It's all in my report.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.987
- Is it?

19:48.020 --> 19:51.524
Because some of the details
in your report

19:51.558 --> 19:54.594
don't line up with what I know
about Will Bowman.

19:54.627 --> 19:59.666
- I saw it with my own eyes.
He's a dangerous man.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.714
There have been
specific instructions

20:14.747 --> 20:17.250
from Proxy Alcala's staff.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.886
I'm just trying to do my job.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.824

a man on the rise.

20:24.857 --> 20:28.395

Nice office.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.433
You don't want to bet
on a loser.

20:35.835 --> 20:41.274
- I, of course, want to be
on the winning side of things.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.842
- I knew you'd be a quick study.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.646
You report to me now.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.781
Anything happens in this bloc,

20:48.815 --> 20:51.318
I want to be the first
to know about it.

I've returned from the dead,
Mr. Bennett.

21:02.895 --> 21:06.533
Do you really want to bet
against me?

21:37.397 --> 21:39.699
- Would you mind sitting down?

21:39.732 --> 21:42.001
- No one'll hear me
all the way down here.

21:42.034 --> 21:45.972
- It's not that.
You're making me nervous.

21:46.005 --> 21:49.609

been here for hours already.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.984

21:59.886 --> 22:02.021

We can handle this.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.430

Quickly.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.922
I can help.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.531
Give me five minutes
alone with her.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.514

23:01.548 --> 23:04.116
- I want to help you.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.018
But first, you need to look me
in the eyes

23:06.052 --> 23:09.556
and swear that this is real.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.123
That you feel
the same way about me

23:11.157 --> 23:12.992
that I feel about you.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.564

the only good things in my life.

after this.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.744
I hope I never see her again.

to get out of this,

you're gonna
have to follow my lead.

that's why she came?

24:47.854 --> 24:50.557
- If the Blackjacks
really did come after her,

24:50.590 --> 24:52.925
it's because of me.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.193

this way.

can fight the Occupation,

- I got the vehicle.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.722
Coming around.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.125
- SUV on the move.
Get to the front.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.060
- Move!

34:27.833 --> 34:28.800
- I'm out front.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.068
Status.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.507

Out of the car!
Out of the car!

.

35:38.904 --> 35:39.238
- You all right?

35:40.572 --> 35:41.907
- Had to lay low
for a couple hours.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.575
- Homeland was running
parallel sweeps.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.911
Drones were everywhere.
- Same on my end.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.813
- Those Blackjacks ordered
that drone strike.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.948
- You ever see anything
like that at Homeland?

35:49.981 --> 35:53.185
Human technology
capable of controlling a drone?

35:53.219 --> 35:54.553
- Never.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.854
- The gauntlet's not
the only thing

35:55.887 --> 35:57.523
they're looking for.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.826
There was some kind of coffin
in the back of that truck.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.529
- Coffin?
- Big enough for a man.

36:03.562 --> 36:06.832
Looked like something--
I don't know--

36:06.865 --> 36:09.468
like something you'd send
into space.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.570
- Was there anyone inside?

36:11.603 --> 36:13.439
- No.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.575
But their onboard computer had
a bunch of dossier files open.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.677
Your profile was in there.

36:18.710 --> 36:19.911
They're looking for you.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.748
- They're looking for all of us.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.217
- Not like this.

36:26.618 --> 36:29.421
- Doesn't matter.
We're leaving the bloc.

36:29.455 --> 36:30.956
- We need to lay low
for a while.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.291
- We don't have time to lay low.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.459
We need to get out of here.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.627

Not now.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.464
- Really?

36:38.497 --> 36:42.834
- If you want to live down here,
in my world...

36:44.270 --> 36:45.404
Yeah.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.773
- Okay.
That's enough.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.341
That's enough.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.942
That's enough.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.751
It went badly.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.420
A disaster, actually.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.622
- What do you mean?

37:36.655 --> 37:38.357
- Most of Lieutenant
van Warmerdam's unit

37:38.390 --> 37:39.991
was killed in an ambush.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.795

- Who?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.437
- I worked in the camps
with Maya and Edison.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.038
They told me to come here.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.810
They said
to ask for "The Cardinal."

Says he knew Edison and Maya
from the camps.

39:19.758 --> 39:20.959
- Bram.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.763
I was hoping
that I'd get to meet you.

Sit. Sit with me.
Please.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.435
Thank you.

Thank you.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.179
- For what?

39:41.212 --> 39:43.682
- For your service in the war.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.918
The destruction of the RAP ship
resonated across the bloc.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.755
It emboldened everyone.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.424
People are starting to wake up,

39:52.458 --> 39:54.960
to see that one person
can make a difference,

39:54.993 --> 39:56.628
and that's all
because of the work

39:56.662 --> 40:03.134
that you and Edison
and Maya did.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.606
- Maya and Edison are gone.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.443
- I hope that you can see

40:11.477 --> 40:15.581
they sacrificed themselves
for something greater.

40:17.015 --> 40:21.620
So, the Occupation released you
from the camp?

40:26.224 --> 40:28.927
- I got in
with the camp administrator

40:28.960 --> 40:31.530
and got him to trust me.

40:33.865 --> 40:37.636
And he took me with him
just before the RAPs.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.742
I'm the only one
who made it out.

40:44.710 --> 40:47.479
- I am so sorry, Bram.

40:47.513 --> 40:50.482
I can't imagine
what you've been through.

40:52.584 --> 40:55.887
But, after all that,
you came here

40:55.921 --> 40:59.124
instead of going home. Why?

40:59.157 --> 41:00.559
- I went home,

41:00.592 --> 41:02.694
but there's nothing there
for me.

41:02.728 --> 41:05.163
- What about your parents?

41:06.898 --> 41:09.568
- They don't know me anymore.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.104
- That's because,
when they look at you,

41:13.138 --> 41:15.707
all they see is their son.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.782
I see so much more.
