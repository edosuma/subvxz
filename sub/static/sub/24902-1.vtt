02:34.578 --> 02:37.247
Father, you shouldn't be here.

02:38.848 --> 02:40.084
You her priest?

02:49.926 --> 02:51.662
You seen this before?

02:54.264 --> 02:57.669
If you know anything
you need to tell me.

03:06.210 --> 03:10.548
Tell me father, how does
something like this happen?

03:16.387 --> 03:19.157
Faith can be a
dangerous thing.

03:45.983 --> 03:47.715
Finally our own place.

03:47.717 --> 03:48.552
Wow.

03:52.389 --> 03:53.391
I love it.

04:02.098 --> 04:03.597
So this is where
you're gonna do it?

04:03.599 --> 04:07.168
In between unpacking boxes and
moving into this shit hole.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.171
Yeah, hey.

04:09.338 --> 04:12.377
Wait you at least
brought em right.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.449
Parent's rings, heavy.

04:21.185 --> 04:23.317
It's meaningful.

04:23.319 --> 04:24.786
It's cheap.

04:24.788 --> 04:26.253
She'll like em.

04:26.255 --> 04:27.923
I still get to be your
best man though right.

04:27.925 --> 04:28.759
Shut up.

04:30.526 --> 04:31.695
Hey come on.

06:23.406 --> 06:25.342
Anna Wallen Thompson,

06:31.314 --> 06:32.817
will you marry me?

06:36.019 --> 06:36.853
Anna?

06:40.923 --> 06:43.260
You don't wanna get married,

06:44.293 --> 06:45.795
you don't love me.

06:46.963 --> 06:49.466
No, I do
love you Tyler.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.700
Tell me.

06:52.702 --> 06:56.439
I don't know, it's
stupid, it, I just can't.

07:12.122 --> 07:13.555
Hey did you see Anna?

07:13.557 --> 07:16.423
Yeah, she went
that way, what's up?

07:16.425 --> 07:17.694
I don't know.

07:18.995 --> 07:21.431
Do you wanna talk about it?

07:23.199 --> 07:25.468
Thank God because feelings,

07:28.572 --> 07:30.005
I'm just gonna go.

07:30.007 --> 07:32.108
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:34.211 --> 07:36.711
Thanks for all the help
I really appreciate it.

07:36.713 --> 07:39.283
Are you kidding me, 20 bucks.

07:40.384 --> 07:41.348
If you want to
give me your money,

07:41.350 --> 07:42.884
bring it on Friday night poker,

07:42.886 --> 07:45.620
or at least be prepared to
offer way more than that,

07:45.622 --> 07:47.555
20 bucks is just insulting,

07:47.557 --> 07:52.026
I may need to rethink
our entire relationship.

07:52.028 --> 07:53.363
Asshole. Fine.

07:56.699 --> 07:58.132
But when I take all your money.

07:58.134 --> 08:00.504
Please, candy from a baby.

08:55.591 --> 08:57.427
Hi, I'm so sorry, I.

08:59.328 --> 09:01.963
Don't be sorry, you have
nothing to be sorry for.

09:01.965 --> 09:06.800
I wasn't expecting it,
we never talked about it,

09:06.802 --> 09:10.474
I guess, I'm not ready
for it, for marriage.

09:12.609 --> 09:15.310
I completely understand.

09:15.312 --> 09:17.214
No, just let me okay.

09:21.150 --> 09:21.983
Okay.

09:21.985 --> 09:22.820
Okay.

09:29.493 --> 09:32.163
My mom got married really young.

09:35.030 --> 09:37.701
She was 21 and pregnant with me,

09:40.370 --> 09:41.772
she was so angry,

09:43.240 --> 09:46.076
angry at her
choices, angry at me,

09:47.943 --> 09:50.014
angry at the whole world.

09:55.317 --> 09:58.655
I don't want to be
like my mother Tyler.

10:00.423 --> 10:02.857
It won't happen to you.

10:02.859 --> 10:04.128
But it might.

10:09.231 --> 10:11.836
I get it, I understand, I do.

10:14.571 --> 10:17.305
I wish I'd talked about it.

10:17.307 --> 10:18.875
I love you Tyler,

10:21.311 --> 10:23.647
just we can still be in love

10:26.649 --> 10:29.252
and not married right, not yet.

10:32.621 --> 10:33.456
Not yet.

10:35.892 --> 10:37.161
I like not yet.

10:39.395 --> 10:40.563
Yeah.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.268
- Tyler, good morning.
- Oh sweet pie.

11:54.270 --> 11:56.970
Honey, did you oversleep.

11:56.972 --> 12:00.307
Hurry up and get dressed
now, go quick, quick, quick.

12:00.309 --> 12:02.410
We need to get to Saint
Andrews and introduce ourselves

12:02.412 --> 12:04.545
before mass starts.

12:04.547 --> 12:08.181
Remember we said we wanted
to go to church with you still,

12:08.183 --> 12:12.523
well here we are, we just
wanna see you get settled.

12:13.456 --> 12:14.922
And meet the priest.

12:14.924 --> 12:19.761
It's very important to make
a good first impression.

12:19.763 --> 12:21.329
Tyler.

12:21.331 --> 12:23.564
My grandparents are here.

12:23.566 --> 12:24.567
Oh my god.

12:30.173 --> 12:33.007
What
is going on here.

12:33.009 --> 12:33.844
Tyler.

12:36.446 --> 12:38.345
I'm so sorry about that,

12:38.347 --> 12:41.616
Tyler didn't tell me you guys
are stopping by this morning.

12:41.618 --> 12:43.184
Would you like some coffee.

12:43.186 --> 12:45.256
Tyler what is going on?

12:46.221 --> 12:48.422
We moved in together.

12:48.424 --> 12:51.559
Tyler you know your
grandfather is a deacon,

12:51.561 --> 12:53.661
how is this going to look?

12:53.663 --> 12:55.396
I don't know
how you were brought up

12:55.398 --> 12:58.168
but Tyler knows
right from wrong.

13:01.104 --> 13:03.706
Grandpa, it's not a big deal,

13:06.076 --> 13:09.344
other churches have
no problem with this.

13:09.346 --> 13:11.514
Not the Catholic church.

13:12.414 --> 13:13.613
You knew it was wrong

13:13.615 --> 13:16.084
and you willingly
chose to do it anyway.

13:16.086 --> 13:19.186
Tyler how could
you do this to us,

13:19.188 --> 13:21.189
after all we've done.

13:21.191 --> 13:24.191
He's a grown man, he
can do what he wants.

13:24.193 --> 13:26.227
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

13:26.229 --> 13:29.500
Sins like this are
gateways to worse.

13:30.899 --> 13:34.334
Do you wanna follow in
your brother's footsteps?

13:34.336 --> 13:35.770
Your grandmother and I

13:35.772 --> 13:39.143
will not watch you invite
evil into your life.

14:39.068 --> 14:40.737
How are you doing?

14:48.711 --> 14:51.481
You know, when
my parents died,

14:53.582 --> 14:56.754
grandparents took
us in, me and Bryan.

14:59.254 --> 15:01.991
They raised us
and they loved us.

15:05.794 --> 15:09.899
They're old fashioned but
just disappointing them

15:11.900 --> 15:14.401
makes me feel like a bad person.

15:14.403 --> 15:18.738
You're not a bad
person, you're a good guy,

15:18.740 --> 15:19.909
you're my guy.

15:24.614 --> 15:28.451
You wanna go inside and
clean this den of sin.

15:30.787 --> 15:31.986
Too soon?

15:31.988 --> 15:32.823
Yes.

15:35.258 --> 15:36.093
Come on.

17:13.890 --> 17:17.857
Babe, come here and let me
try and cleanse your aura.

17:19.996 --> 17:23.863
All that guilt's got
it muddy and gross.

17:23.865 --> 17:27.701
I have a gross aura,
does it smell too?

17:27.703 --> 17:30.504
Come on you know I don't
believe in that stuff.

17:30.506 --> 17:35.209
I know but maybe it
will make you feel better.

17:35.211 --> 17:36.813
Come on, come here.

17:42.618 --> 17:43.452
Okay.

19:42.538 --> 19:44.540
Coffee's ready.

20:20.876 --> 20:23.046
Thanks for making it in.

20:25.714 --> 20:26.549
Sure.

20:27.950 --> 20:30.551
They added another module
to the Thompson project.

20:30.553 --> 20:33.787
Yeah sorry, the move take
a lot longer than expected.

20:33.789 --> 20:36.960
So the changes
need to be done ASAP,

20:38.594 --> 20:40.494
and no fuck ups this time.

20:40.496 --> 20:41.562
Okay.

20:41.564 --> 20:42.399
Okay.

21:29.479 --> 21:31.548
Tyler can you get that.

21:39.888 --> 21:41.121
Tyler.

21:41.123 --> 21:41.958
What.

21:45.094 --> 21:46.059
Yes.

21:46.061 --> 21:48.295
I'm looking for Tyler Iske.

21:48.297 --> 21:49.697
Tyler.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.131
What's going on.

21:51.133 --> 21:53.202
Tyler, I'm Father Shaw.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.835
I realize this is a bit awkward

21:55.837 --> 21:58.005
but I need to speak with
you about something.

21:58.007 --> 21:59.373
I am so sorry about this,

21:59.375 --> 22:01.875
I did not think they
would stoop to this.

22:01.877 --> 22:05.578
Look we're not interested
in anything you have to say.

22:05.580 --> 22:07.213
I know my grandparents
mean well but.

22:07.215 --> 22:10.183
This has nothing to do
with your grandparents.

22:10.185 --> 22:11.684
It's very important,

22:11.686 --> 22:14.688
may I please just have a
few minutes of your time.

22:14.690 --> 22:17.124
Please come in.

22:20.162 --> 22:21.495
As religions go,

22:21.497 --> 22:24.498
Catholicism has a
fairly bloody reputation

22:24.500 --> 22:29.036
probably because it was
founded in such a dark age.

22:29.038 --> 22:31.905
And it's ironic because the
original point of the church

22:31.907 --> 22:34.173
was to bring light
into the darkness

22:34.175 --> 22:37.378
but all births
begin in blood so,

22:37.380 --> 22:41.215
the heavenly father
must have a plan for us.

22:41.217 --> 22:44.721
Father Shaw, I wanna
be honest with you,

22:46.955 --> 22:50.190
I'm just not a practicing
Catholic right now.

22:50.192 --> 22:53.128
I guess I've
broadened my horizons.

22:56.097 --> 22:59.132
I just don't believe
in it anymore.

22:59.134 --> 23:01.634
That's the problem,
don't you see,

23:01.636 --> 23:04.537
at one time you did believe,

23:04.539 --> 23:08.409
as a child you believed and
your belief made it real,

23:08.411 --> 23:11.378
in your mind, in your
body, even your DNA.

23:11.380 --> 23:13.283
Belief changes reality.

23:17.452 --> 23:20.086
You think this is all
mystical bullshit.

23:20.088 --> 23:22.555
No it's science, quantum
physics, string theory,

23:22.557 --> 23:27.564
hell in a few years, it will
probably be the new gospel.

23:28.730 --> 23:32.632
But now, as the church
begins to understand it,

23:32.634 --> 23:37.473
we begin to realize the danger
we've put our followers in.

23:38.406 --> 23:40.409
It's our fault, I admit.

23:42.411 --> 23:44.911
The church has so many
secrets, so much guilt

23:44.913 --> 23:48.915
that this new blood on our
hands should seem like nothing

23:48.917 --> 23:50.319
but it's an evil,

23:53.355 --> 23:55.424
a power much like a virus

23:56.558 --> 23:59.426
and we've all been infected,

23:59.428 --> 24:02.866
those of us who believe
or have believed.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.699
We call it Corruptor.

24:09.337 --> 24:12.105
Would you like cream or
sugar with your coffee.

24:12.107 --> 24:13.342
Black please.

24:21.784 --> 24:25.789
Even in the bible, it
says when I was a child,

24:26.955 --> 24:31.124
I spoke as a child, I
reasoned as a child,

24:31.594 --> 24:35.865
but when I became a man, I
put childish things away.

24:37.066 --> 24:39.232
The things I believed as
a child have no bearing

24:39.234 --> 24:40.267
on my life now.

24:40.269 --> 24:42.538
Of course they do, think,

24:43.673 --> 24:47.109
what commandments are
you breaking right now.

24:49.412 --> 24:53.316
Honor thy mother and
thy father, fornication.

24:55.317 --> 24:58.184
Listen are you trying to
say that I'm going to hell

24:58.186 --> 25:00.487
just for breaking
a few minor laws,

25:00.489 --> 25:05.461
in a religion that was created
in humanity's dark ages.

25:06.561 --> 25:08.728
At one time you
believed, now you don't.

25:08.730 --> 25:11.664
All the things you
believed in as a child,

25:11.666 --> 25:14.133
the Holy Spirit,
the Virgin Mary,

25:14.135 --> 25:18.875
communion, demons, the devil,
you made those things real.

25:20.542 --> 25:24.277
You accepted the laws, honor
thy father and thy mother,

25:24.279 --> 25:27.815
have no gods before him,
do not commit adultery

25:27.817 --> 25:32.655
and you abided by them, thusly
you were protected by them,

25:33.855 --> 25:37.093
protected from the
darkness, from evil.

25:38.560 --> 25:42.161
Those laws, you can be punished
for breaking them even now,

25:42.163 --> 25:45.099
even though you say
you don't believe.

25:45.101 --> 25:46.836
It all still applies.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.536
It's ridiculous.

25:50.538 --> 25:53.475
It's time for you
to leave, please.

26:26.174 --> 26:27.676
Let me help you.

26:36.384 --> 26:40.520
He threw water on you,
we should call the cops.

26:40.522 --> 26:43.192
No, it's just a crazy old man,

26:44.993 --> 26:47.230
probably not even a priest.

26:48.631 --> 26:52.569
Do you really think your
grandparents sent him?

26:54.670 --> 26:55.471
Maybe.

26:56.505 --> 26:59.075
I'm so creeped out right now.

27:03.746 --> 27:06.316
You're my big strong protector.

27:35.510 --> 27:37.143
This is Shaw.

27:37.145 --> 27:38.812
I haven't seen
any true signs yet

27:38.814 --> 27:42.349
but my instincts tell
me that this is the one.

27:42.351 --> 27:46.022
We need someone down
here to watch this kid.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.006
Tyler.

28:06.008 --> 28:08.311
Hey grandma, can I come in?

28:10.246 --> 28:12.015
No, I'm afraid not.

28:13.982 --> 28:15.382
Where's grandpa?

28:15.384 --> 28:17.450
He's taking a nap right now.

28:17.452 --> 28:18.885
Well wake him up
'cause I'm not leaving

28:18.887 --> 28:21.557
until we talk about Father Shaw.

28:23.858 --> 28:27.094
Then he said something
crazy about a virus,

28:27.096 --> 28:29.095
or an entity or something,

28:29.097 --> 28:31.331
I couldn't sleep last
night because of him.

28:31.333 --> 28:35.438
I told you we know
nothing about a Father Shaw,

28:36.305 --> 28:38.771
maybe Saint Andrews sent him.

28:38.773 --> 28:40.740
I understand their
priest keeps a close eye

28:40.742 --> 28:42.412
on his parishioners.

28:43.578 --> 28:44.944
How would they have known

28:44.946 --> 28:47.980
if you or grandpa
didn't tell em?

28:47.982 --> 28:49.219
We told no one,

28:50.818 --> 28:55.021
I don't need people
staring at me after mass.

28:55.023 --> 28:57.192
Whispering behind my back,

28:58.559 --> 29:02.264
I went through that
already with your brother.

29:09.538 --> 29:10.373
Bryan.

29:14.343 --> 29:16.412
He was gay, not a pervert

29:20.048 --> 29:22.682
and you and grandpa were
wrong to kick him out.

29:22.684 --> 29:24.854
We were thinking of you.

29:26.387 --> 29:30.824
And now, you have to decide
what's more important,

29:30.826 --> 29:33.496
that girl or your immortal soul.

29:38.767 --> 29:41.604
Her name is Anna
and I love her.

29:46.976 --> 29:50.914
And I don't give a damn
about my immortal soul.

30:16.505 --> 30:19.509
Tyler
you're gonna be late.

32:07.648 --> 32:08.483
Mary.

32:22.698 --> 32:25.701
Jesus fucking Christ,
what the fuck.

32:28.936 --> 32:30.939
Oh, Mary, I am so sorry,

32:33.642 --> 32:35.545
fuck, I am so so sorry.

33:00.536 --> 33:01.671
What the fuck.

33:32.701 --> 33:35.701
Tyler, what is going on.

33:35.703 --> 33:37.938
Mary said you attacked
her by the copier.

33:37.940 --> 33:40.239
No that was an accident,
I didn't mean to.

33:40.241 --> 33:43.512
Stop, just stop
it, get back to work.

33:47.848 --> 33:49.315
If it wasn't for
the Thompson project

33:49.317 --> 33:51.988
you'd be cleaning out your desk.

34:43.605 --> 34:45.942
I didn't hear you come in.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.945
What are you doing?

34:50.777 --> 34:53.947
Do you have to burn
that shit in here?

34:53.949 --> 34:55.514
What.

34:55.516 --> 34:59.521
You're clinging
to this fake religion.

35:00.989 --> 35:03.389
Your mom wasn't exactly the
best example of how to be.

35:03.391 --> 35:05.157
What are you talking about?

35:05.159 --> 35:08.927
She teaches you that
marriage is a prison.

35:08.929 --> 35:13.268
When in fact, it's the only
pure way, truly pure way

35:15.003 --> 35:16.802
for two people to be together.

35:16.804 --> 35:18.974
Babe I don't understand.

35:21.208 --> 35:26.146
Being willing to live
together, without being married,

35:26.148 --> 35:30.983
you're kind of acting like
a real whore right now.

38:19.887 --> 38:21.891
Tyler what's going on?

38:28.163 --> 38:31.166
Babe is this still
about last night?

38:35.336 --> 38:37.672
I'm sorry about the incense.

38:46.014 --> 38:46.849
Hey.

38:50.684 --> 38:52.086
What's happening.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.824
What are you doing out here?

39:00.427 --> 39:01.864
What time is it?

39:04.199 --> 39:05.034
Shit.

39:20.681 --> 39:21.683
Thanks baby.

39:24.184 --> 39:28.054
Tyler we need to
talk about last night.

39:28.056 --> 39:30.423
Now that you've slept on it.

39:30.425 --> 39:33.126
Well I've overslept
so I need to go

39:33.128 --> 39:34.894
but let's talk about
it tonight okay.

39:34.896 --> 39:37.233
No, Tyler what's going on.

39:40.969 --> 39:41.804
Nothing.

39:46.474 --> 39:50.476
I haven't been sleeping
well since we moved in,

39:50.478 --> 39:53.679
I've been having these dreams.

39:53.681 --> 39:55.016
No I mean why?

40:01.989 --> 40:03.057
God dammit.

40:05.659 --> 40:07.328
I got it, just go.

40:12.067 --> 40:12.902
Hey.

40:30.485 --> 40:31.320
Shut up.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.414
Tyler.

43:18.052 --> 43:19.121
Tyler, Tyler.

43:27.362 --> 43:28.530
My office now.

43:53.420 --> 43:56.190
You look like
you need a drink.

44:06.233 --> 44:07.902
I know a good place.

44:10.371 --> 44:14.941
Look at these photos, a young
bride on her wedding day

44:14.943 --> 44:17.543
dressed in white like a virgin,

44:17.545 --> 44:20.045
but she wasn't a virgin.

44:20.047 --> 44:23.782
Possessed by the virus, the
entity we call Corruptor

44:23.784 --> 44:27.121
she killed herself
and her unborn child.

44:28.856 --> 44:33.726
And it shall stalk the lost
sheep down to the last lamb.

44:40.168 --> 44:43.271
Tyler, did you take
Latin in college?

44:45.472 --> 44:46.307
No.

44:50.510 --> 44:52.644
We need to get to
your house immediately,

44:52.646 --> 44:56.083
I can prepare you for
the exorcism there.

44:58.085 --> 44:59.353
You knew her.

45:00.621 --> 45:03.826
She meant something
to you, personally.

45:06.860 --> 45:09.964
Water, I need
water here right now.

45:33.054 --> 45:37.392
This is Shaw, I've witnessed
two of the three signs.

45:43.563 --> 45:46.065
He didn't tell me you
guys were going out tonight.

45:46.067 --> 45:47.833
I think it will be
real good for him.

45:47.835 --> 45:52.037
I think all of this has
got him stressed out.

45:52.039 --> 45:54.476
Oh yeah moving in and work.

45:55.677 --> 45:57.246
Speak of the devil.

46:19.733 --> 46:24.405
Hey, I was starting to think
you were gonna blow me off.

46:26.239 --> 46:27.074
What?

46:29.277 --> 46:31.213
Shit, you did forget.

46:32.646 --> 46:34.579
Well it's poker night bitch

46:34.581 --> 46:39.186
and I'm here to take all your
money, come on, let's go.

46:47.327 --> 46:49.331
Have a good time babe.

46:52.300 --> 46:53.135
Goodbye.

47:11.585 --> 47:12.420
Two.

47:21.963 --> 47:24.896
You gonna bet or what.

47:24.898 --> 47:26.932
We've been waiting here.

47:26.934 --> 47:27.867
Come on.

47:27.869 --> 47:29.135
This is stupid now.

47:29.137 --> 47:30.369
Just play the game.

47:30.371 --> 47:32.840
Why'd you
bring this guy.

47:33.875 --> 47:35.608
Free money.

47:35.610 --> 47:36.778
Right.

47:38.346 --> 47:40.912
Look at how he throws.

47:40.914 --> 47:41.750
Dude.

48:02.269 --> 48:03.105
Fuck.

48:06.407 --> 48:07.242
Again!

48:11.646 --> 48:14.880
How'd you know where
the other ace was?

48:14.882 --> 48:16.182
Man this is bullshit.

48:16.184 --> 48:20.286
Hey whoa, alright it's
just a lucky streak.

48:20.288 --> 48:23.458
Come on, let's take
a break, let's go.

48:30.197 --> 48:32.701
So anything you wanna tell me?

48:34.534 --> 48:35.369
Nothing.

48:36.670 --> 48:39.407
Tyler, what the
fuck, talk to me.

48:43.244 --> 48:44.677
Eric.

48:44.679 --> 48:45.514
Yeah.

48:52.385 --> 48:56.557
I don't know, I'm loosing
a lot of sleep lately.

49:03.965 --> 49:06.134
Is anyone talking, oh kid.

49:07.501 --> 49:09.168
You're not leaving
till you give us a chance

49:09.170 --> 49:10.836
to win our money back.

49:10.838 --> 49:12.271
Dude.

49:12.273 --> 49:16.812
It's like you know what we're
holding, fucking bullshit.

49:17.545 --> 49:18.978
How are you doing that?

49:18.980 --> 49:20.246
Are you helping him.

49:20.248 --> 49:23.782
No, it's just a
lucky streak that's all.

49:23.784 --> 49:28.456
I don't like it, I don't
like it and I don't like you.

49:36.463 --> 49:40.701
Dude, dude, come on, get
the fuck outta here man.

49:42.702 --> 49:44.170
What the fuck man?

49:44.172 --> 49:47.106
I don't know, I don't know,
I didn't want to hurt him,

49:47.108 --> 49:48.807
I couldn't stop it.

49:48.809 --> 49:51.443
They're going
to call the cops.

49:51.445 --> 49:53.782
What the fuck is going on.

49:56.284 --> 50:01.289
Please, help me please, please
please help me, help me.

50:01.755 --> 50:02.324
Fuck.

50:04.525 --> 50:05.360
Okay.

50:06.226 --> 50:07.126
Okay.

50:07.128 --> 50:08.630
Let's go.

52:49.523 --> 52:50.358
Bryan.

55:38.291 --> 55:40.027
Where are you guys?

55:43.097 --> 55:44.530
I am supposed to be at work,

55:44.532 --> 55:46.965
I don't know where
he is, do you?

55:46.967 --> 55:48.700
I dropped him off
here last night,

55:48.702 --> 55:51.306
you sure he's not in the house?

55:56.010 --> 55:56.845
Tyler.

55:58.012 --> 56:00.211
What did you
guys do last night?

56:00.213 --> 56:01.746
Just played poker
with the guys,

56:01.748 --> 56:03.447
he's gotta be here somewhere.

56:03.449 --> 56:04.284
Tyler.

56:11.157 --> 56:11.992
Tyler.

58:15.682 --> 58:16.516
Eric!

58:19.318 --> 58:22.155
I don't understand,
he's freezing.

58:25.159 --> 58:26.590
We should take
him to a hospital.

58:26.592 --> 58:30.528
Whoa, listen, I
didn't want to tell you,

58:30.530 --> 58:34.034
but last night he drank
a lot, like a lot.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.342
This is all my fault.

58:44.077 --> 58:46.545
Let's just give
him some space,

58:46.547 --> 58:49.884
I'll stay here with
him, you go to work.

58:51.284 --> 58:55.222
Alright, I'll find
someone to cover my shift.

59:29.822 --> 59:32.590
Wake up asshole, good news,

59:32.592 --> 59:35.827
I just came from the
hospital, Dean's alive.

59:35.829 --> 59:39.331
But he's gonna be
pressing charges so.

59:39.333 --> 59:40.168
Shit.

01:01:35.782 --> 01:01:36.617
Tyler!

01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:51.598
We're not open yet.

01:01:56.068 --> 01:01:58.869
Please just listen to me.

01:01:58.871 --> 01:02:01.041
You're in terrible danger.

01:02:03.844 --> 01:02:05.677
What are you doing here?

01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:07.347
You can't go home.

01:02:09.615 --> 01:02:13.851
Has Tyler shown any examples
of unexpected strength?

01:02:13.853 --> 01:02:16.621
Tell me, I can't make the call

01:02:16.623 --> 01:02:19.559
until all three
conditions are met.

01:02:22.429 --> 01:02:26.164
All the mass murders
you read about,

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:28.199
the normal citizens
who suddenly snap

01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:31.135
and massacre their families,
neighbors, their coworkers

01:02:31.137 --> 01:02:33.907
in the most violent
way possible,

01:02:35.442 --> 01:02:37.545
they all begin like this.

01:02:41.081 --> 01:02:42.746
You are so lost that you think

01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:46.016
it's just the human condition.

01:02:46.018 --> 01:02:48.753
You have never
known true belief,

01:02:48.755 --> 01:02:52.657
An innocent heart is like
food to the demonic hoard

01:02:52.659 --> 01:02:54.258
and Corruptor wants nothing more

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.760
than to turn our
belief against us.

01:02:56.762 --> 01:03:00.932
To destroy us for willing
it into existence.

01:03:00.934 --> 01:03:02.202
You're crazy.

01:03:03.603 --> 01:03:06.905
I believe that Tyler is
Corruptor's next victim,

01:03:06.907 --> 01:03:10.141
but I can't help
him unless I'm sure.

01:03:10.143 --> 01:03:11.608
What did you do to Tyler?

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.681
I'm trying to save him.

01:03:43.844 --> 01:03:44.679
Tyler.

01:04:01.894 --> 01:04:03.663
I'm in the kitchen.

01:04:08.601 --> 01:04:10.603
I made it fresh for you.

01:04:27.987 --> 01:04:29.756
Anything from Shaw?

01:04:35.128 --> 01:04:35.963
No.

01:04:39.365 --> 01:04:40.967
About the beeper?

01:04:53.646 --> 01:04:56.217
No one uses the beeper anymore.

01:05:00.786 --> 01:05:02.188
I miss the beeps.

01:06:25.405 --> 01:06:26.407
Check again.

01:06:32.211 --> 01:06:33.547
Still nothing.

01:06:38.684 --> 01:06:40.520
Bye honey, love you.

01:07:00.974 --> 01:07:03.376
I can't see from here, you?

01:07:33.106 --> 01:07:35.276
Tyler, why are you here?

01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:41.382
I wanted to give you
your exit interview.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:39.640
No, no, no, no!

01:09:15.774 --> 01:09:16.707
Hello.

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:18.712
Grandma, hi it's Tyler.

01:09:21.014 --> 01:09:22.813
Tyler.

01:09:22.814 --> 01:09:24.816
Don't hang up, don't hang up.

01:09:24.818 --> 01:09:26.153
Tyler.

01:09:30.023 --> 01:09:30.858
Tyler.

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:37.865
Anna and I broke up,

01:09:39.198 --> 01:09:41.631
can you and grandpa
come over this evening,

01:09:41.634 --> 01:09:43.470
I'm real sad about it.

01:10:55.942 --> 01:10:58.011
Tyler, what's going on?

01:11:06.519 --> 01:11:07.521
Babe please.

01:11:08.822 --> 01:11:10.090
Anna.

01:11:11.056 --> 01:11:13.059
Tyler please untie me.

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.138
What's happening to me?

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.643
Babe it's okay, you're okay.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.916
Please let me help you.

01:11:42.188 --> 01:11:43.023
Help me.

01:11:45.158 --> 01:11:45.993
Eric!

01:11:50.863 --> 01:11:53.498
I wanted him to help me.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.435
Begged him, the priest,

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:01.942
he wanted to help me.

01:12:05.078 --> 01:12:08.348
But I didn't listen.
I couldn't listen.

01:12:14.186 --> 01:12:17.256
Babe please
let me help you,

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:21.659
I love you.

01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:24.931
I told him I was
sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:12:31.304 --> 01:12:35.074
He wouldn't stop, he
wouldn't leave me alone.

01:12:37.976 --> 01:12:39.912
I had to listen to him.

01:12:45.918 --> 01:12:48.619
I had to do those things.

01:12:48.621 --> 01:12:50.623
What, what did you do?

01:12:53.659 --> 01:12:54.728
Everything.

01:13:02.135 --> 01:13:04.805
She is the cause of your sins.

01:13:07.573 --> 01:13:10.911
Tyler please, I
thought we were happy.

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:36.335
Do you brother
take her to be your wife

01:13:37.369 --> 01:13:38.939
by the laws of God.

01:13:41.608 --> 01:13:42.940
I do.

01:13:42.942 --> 01:13:46.346
And does she take
you to be her husband

01:13:47.512 --> 01:13:49.082
by the laws of God.

01:13:50.617 --> 01:13:51.518
She does.

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:14.908
You made me do this
Anna, you made me.

01:14:43.136 --> 01:14:43.968
Tyler.

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:44.902
Tyler.

01:14:44.904 --> 01:14:46.907
Tyler honey we're here.

01:14:49.307 --> 01:14:50.143
Tyler.

01:14:52.478 --> 01:14:53.313
Poor boy.

01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:00.052
I'm sure he'll be
back in a minute.

01:15:01.587 --> 01:15:05.192
I'm gonna use the
facilities while we wait.

01:15:29.548 --> 01:15:31.014
It's not Tyler.

01:15:31.016 --> 01:15:32.249
Okay where is he?

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:34.018
I don't know,
we need to leave.

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.652
I know but we
have to find him.

01:15:35.654 --> 01:15:36.489
Tyler.

01:15:57.009 --> 01:15:58.511
It might be Tyler.

01:16:19.498 --> 01:16:20.500
Oh dear God.

01:16:22.935 --> 01:16:25.939
Flora, we need
to call the police.

01:16:27.774 --> 01:16:29.509
George she's alive.

01:16:34.814 --> 01:16:37.484
Tyler I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:46.525
It is my fault,

01:16:50.563 --> 01:16:52.231
I didn't understand.

01:16:56.034 --> 01:16:58.371
Oh George help me.

01:17:02.041 --> 01:17:05.811
I'm sorry, I didn't
know, I opened the door

01:17:09.181 --> 01:17:10.617
and they came in.

01:17:12.251 --> 01:17:14.921
It knows your sins, all of them.

01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:31.037
George, George.

01:17:41.581 --> 01:17:45.085
Grandma, grandpa, I
am glad you're here.

01:17:48.119 --> 01:17:50.457
Tyler, what have you done?

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:52.956
Done.

01:17:52.958 --> 01:17:56.626
I think you know
I'm not done yet.

01:17:56.628 --> 01:18:01.033
Honey, whatever has
happened, you know we love you.

01:18:05.104 --> 01:18:08.472
You always had such a funny
way of showing your love.

01:18:08.474 --> 01:18:12.076
Tyler, stop this,
it's not too late,

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:13.710
we can help you.

01:18:13.712 --> 01:18:16.483
Like you helped
me grandfather.

01:18:19.585 --> 01:18:20.654
No.

01:18:22.622 --> 01:18:25.125
Shut up, you did this to him

01:18:27.092 --> 01:18:29.826
and I stood by and let you.

01:18:29.828 --> 01:18:33.162
I was thrown out
like spoiled meat.

01:18:33.164 --> 01:18:34.865
Like spoiled meat.

01:18:34.867 --> 01:18:37.101
In so much pain.

01:18:37.103 --> 01:18:38.337
So much pain.

01:18:39.805 --> 01:18:41.074
No Tyler, no.

01:18:46.578 --> 01:18:49.248
Bryan, Bryan, please forgive me.

01:18:53.485 --> 01:18:54.554
No, George.

01:18:58.957 --> 01:19:01.157
Tyler, but he's
your grandfather.

01:19:01.159 --> 01:19:02.826
Punished for his sins.

01:19:02.828 --> 01:19:06.266
Bryan knows grandma,
he knows everything.

01:19:07.667 --> 01:19:11.335
We did our best for you
boys after your parents died

01:19:11.337 --> 01:19:14.504
but Bryan he was beyond saving.

01:19:17.409 --> 01:19:22.245
You always said to hate
the sin and love the sinner.

01:19:22.247 --> 01:19:25.616
He refused treatment,
did he tell you that,

01:19:25.618 --> 01:19:27.520
Bryan refused our help.

01:19:29.387 --> 01:19:33.958
We would have done anything
for you boys, anything.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:38.062
Turning him out's the last
thing we could think of.

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:39.733
We were so afraid of

01:19:43.769 --> 01:19:45.605
what people would say.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.576
Oh Tyler, I'm so sorry.

01:19:53.345 --> 01:19:55.447
I know grandma, I know.

01:20:01.854 --> 01:20:05.625
You need to go, right
now, go, go, go, now.

01:20:08.927 --> 01:20:13.162
Look at that would you,
I guess now we know.

01:20:13.164 --> 01:20:17.336
Sometimes it is just an
asshole with anger issues.

01:20:19.537 --> 01:20:21.571
You fucked up,

01:20:21.573 --> 01:20:24.107
as soon as you pulled that
trick with the door we knew.

01:20:24.109 --> 01:20:25.642
You're too late,

01:20:25.644 --> 01:20:27.844
my brother and I are
doing good work here.

01:20:27.846 --> 01:20:31.080
It's not your
brother, it's Corruptor,

01:20:31.082 --> 01:20:34.151
he's just another fuck demon.

01:20:34.153 --> 01:20:36.323
We're here to destroy him.

01:20:37.555 --> 01:20:39.291
This is gonna hurt.

01:20:40.725 --> 01:20:43.662
Come and get it,
come and get it.

01:20:46.498 --> 01:20:47.998
Come on, get him out.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.500
I command you unclean
spirit depart they servant,

01:20:49.502 --> 01:20:51.168
may the son of iniquity
be powerless to harm him,

01:20:51.170 --> 01:20:55.240
I command you unclean
spirit, depart thy servant.

01:21:00.512 --> 01:21:03.112
I command you unclean
spirit, depart thy servant,

01:21:03.114 --> 01:21:05.382
let my enemy have
no power over him,

01:21:05.384 --> 01:21:07.217
be powerless to harm him.

01:21:07.219 --> 01:21:08.387
I command you.

01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:13.490
This is gonna hurt.

01:21:13.492 --> 01:21:14.458
Motherfucker.

01:22:45.384 --> 01:22:49.221
Let the enemy
have no power over him.

01:23:03.735 --> 01:23:07.239
He's finished, he
can withstand no more.

01:23:44.342 --> 01:23:45.411
Abel, Abel.

01:23:55.386 --> 01:23:58.791
Christ on a.

01:24:06.465 --> 01:24:09.566
Why do I always have
to be the sin eater.

01:24:09.568 --> 01:24:12.639
You should take a
turn now and again.

01:24:13.605 --> 01:24:15.007
Did we kill them?

01:24:16.408 --> 01:24:17.911
Not all of them.

01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:20.345
Fuck, fucker.

01:24:25.283 --> 01:24:26.552
About that boy?

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.990
Grandma took him before
our guys could get there.

01:24:34.792 --> 01:24:38.695
I don't suppose we can call
this one a win then can we?

01:24:38.697 --> 01:24:41.164
It's all about the balance.

01:24:41.166 --> 01:24:42.502
Yeah, balance.

01:24:45.203 --> 01:24:46.038
Christ.

01:24:47.439 --> 01:24:50.276
We'll get em next
time, next time.
