00:50.360 --> 00:52.130
What's that?

00:54.520 --> 00:55.767
Halt!

00:57.400 --> 00:59.409
You there! Stop!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.969
- Water.
- Who did this to you?

01:18.160 --> 01:19.486
A monster.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.722
The most hideous and deformed
creature to ever roam the desert.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.924
They call him

01:27.320 --> 01:29.522
the Scorpion King.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.820
That's just an old campfire story.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.740
The Scorpion King's not real.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.961
Boo.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.460
Take him!

01:54.360 --> 01:55.766
Sword!

02:09.560 --> 02:10.886
Really?

02:11.120 --> 02:13.561
The most hideous,
deformed creature to roam the desert?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.445
Well, you do look a little tired.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.740
How come I always have to
get dragged by the camel?

02:23.840 --> 02:28.500
Because I am the master
and you are the apprentice.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.020
Partner.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.140
Helper.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.020
Come on. I've followed you for a year.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.890
Think of what we've
been through together.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.091
We're a team.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.140
Okay. Fine.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.646
Partner.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.740
Live free.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.041
Die well.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.890
That must be the treasure room.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.860
Allow me.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.846
Hey!

03:11.040 --> 03:12.401
Well, that's inconvenient.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.540
Now what?

03:13.640 --> 03:14.841
Don't move.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.330
Well, that wasn't too bad.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.245
You were saying?

03:24.600 --> 03:25.860
We could go back.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.481
If that's where the treasure room is,
that's where we're going.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.129
Ready? Watch out.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.761
Now. And one, two...

03:41.640 --> 03:42.740
Don't get any funny ideas.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.087
With your breath?

03:44.960 --> 03:46.605
Follow my lead.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.610
I hope that's your knife in your pocket.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.651
Get off!

04:37.480 --> 04:40.889
There it is. The urn of Kings.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.620
They say whoever can
decipher those inscriptions

04:44.720 --> 04:47.924
will find the key to unstoppable power.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.081
Do you believe that?

04:50.680 --> 04:52.086
I don't need to believe it.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.204
We just need to grab it and get paid.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.700
Have a think about it, Mathayus.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.020
The power. The glory.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.740
With this, we could rule
the world together.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.246
Wait.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.921
Replace it with this.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.380
Any more bright ideas?

05:39.480 --> 05:41.648
Yeah. Let's go fishing.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.648
Okay. Ready? Pull.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.850
That's good. Go! Go!

06:12.640 --> 06:14.080
Stop!

06:29.120 --> 06:31.084
We should keep the urn!

06:36.800 --> 06:38.365
No! I'm taking it to Al-Moraad.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.006
I swore an oath to the King.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.327
You have much to learn, Drazen.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.569
And yet there's so much
you've taught me already.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.645
What do you think you're
doing in my palace?

07:46.720 --> 07:48.300
Redecorating?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.763
Nobody steals from me.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.562
Stupid fool.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.809
Get ready to die.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.561
How's that for fishing?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.321
Better late than never!

09:01.720 --> 09:03.160
Getting a little...

09:04.960 --> 09:07.527
Tie him up! Reel him in!

09:10.360 --> 09:12.050
Get the urn!

09:20.800 --> 09:22.580
- Hand it to me!
- Here.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.041
Now let's get out of here.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.060
Help me move this thing.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.409
You are everything your
legend foretold, Scorpion King.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.420
- You're betraying me.
- I've followed you long enough.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.405
You see, I have bigger ambitions
than just being a warrior.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.366
It takes more than a sword
and a crown to be king, Drazen.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.810
But I have more. I have the urn.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.207
Thank you, Mathayus. For everything.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.327
And this is why I work alone.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.260
Mathayus of Akkad.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.260
Last of the Black Scorpion Warriors.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.766
Your Majesty.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.563
You were chosen for one
simple but important task.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.371
And I will complete that task.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.570
Do you know who that is?

10:40.040 --> 10:44.086
That's Lord Alcaman. The last
king to rule the entire world.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.680
How did he do it?

10:45.960 --> 10:47.924
He must have commanded a large army.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.046
No. He was a sorcerer.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.540
He walked on air, he commanded fire,

10:54.640 --> 10:56.604
and he had dark magic.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.980
And the key to his power is
painted on the side of an urn.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.260
That urn is now in the hands of a fool.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.925
I'll find Drazen.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.125
I will hunt him down and bring
his head to you on a spike.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.006
No. You won't.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.120
Drazen wasn't only a thief.
He was also a spy.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.689
Clever enough to fool us both.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.900
He came from the Northern forest.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.260
A kingdom called Norvania.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.220
Your Majesty, give me a dozen men.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.100
I will burn that castle to the ground.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.780
I will bury them under it
and bring you the urn.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.320
Sire?

11:34.240 --> 11:38.809
This is a peace agreement.
You will give it to him.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.180
You can't be serious.

11:42.280 --> 11:47.008
Unless you bring me the urn,
we only have one choice.

11:47.120 --> 11:51.530
Your Highness, I am not the person
that you send to make peace.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.400
I will not go.

11:55.800 --> 12:00.740
<i>The location of Alcaman's legendary
fortress has been lost over time,</i>

12:00.840 --> 12:04.123
<i>with all its secret magic locked inside.</i>

12:04.320 --> 12:08.700
<i>Wise kings understood that magic
power is better left untouched.</i>

12:08.800 --> 12:11.700
<i>It is too powerful in mortal hands.</i>

12:11.800 --> 12:15.243
<i>The fate of the world rests
on your shoulders now.</i>

12:15.480 --> 12:17.808
<i>Make peace, my warrior son.</i>

12:27.520 --> 12:29.085
There he is.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.320
Father.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.020
Look at you.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.140
- How long has it been?
- One year.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.020
Operating inside the
palace of King Zakkour.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.780
Fighting alongside one of his
top mercenaries, an Akkadian warrior.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.180
- An Akkadian?
- Yes.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.860
And I suspect he is kicking himself now.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.891
Why? Did you bring me something?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.448
The urn of Kings.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.167
Father, no...

13:05.960 --> 13:08.242
You have delivered the
future of our great kingdom.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.921
It's a key?

13:10.280 --> 13:12.540
The Golden Key of Lord Alcaman.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.763
If we can decipher its inscriptions,

13:14.960 --> 13:18.084
it will lead us to powers
no kingdom can imagine.

13:18.280 --> 13:22.121
And you have kept it from our enemies.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.487
What is that? What's on its back?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.089
What manner of horse is that?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.845
That's not a horse, you idiot.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.845
It's called a giraffe.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.802
They're from the Southern lands.

13:58.720 --> 13:59.967
Sir...

14:10.560 --> 14:12.603
Barkeep. Ale, please.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.300
I need to see the King.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.001
Stranger, he's not a nice man.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.860
Best you finish your drink and leave.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.323
Thanks for the advice,
but I still need to see the King.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.140
I know the King. I work for him.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.340
Oh.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.340
You're in the royal band.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.802
We are the King's guards.

14:36.920 --> 14:41.409
You wanna get to him,
you gotta go through us.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.606
Well, that could be fun.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.380
Where are you from, stranger?

14:46.480 --> 14:49.650
I have a message from King
Zakkour at Al-Moraad.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.691
And I come in peace.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.800
All by yourself? In Norvania?

14:58.480 --> 15:01.380
Well, you're either the
dumbest man on Earth,

15:01.480 --> 15:04.365
or I'm imagining this
whole conversation.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.044
Let me see.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.684
Nope, he's real.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.728
Which means he must be dumb.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.082
I come in peace.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.740
Take me to your king. Please.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.883
I have a saying.

15:26.160 --> 15:30.809
The winner of a fight isn't the
stronger man or the more skilled man,

15:31.480 --> 15:33.569
it's the hungriest.

15:34.040 --> 15:38.040
Oh, well, then you must
win a lot of fights.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.968
You can laugh. It's funny.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.331
You messed with the wrong soldier.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.167
All right. You've won the fight.

17:19.599 --> 17:20.900
Right.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.125
Now would you please arrest
me and take me to your king?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.886
I said, I need to see the King.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.700
I'll give him your love letter.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.841
Let me guess, you're innocent.

17:42.480 --> 17:46.620
If you could only plead your case
to the King, he'd set you free.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.580
Not that simple.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.460
So you're not just innocent,
you're special.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.620
What if I could arrange a meeting
for you with King Yannick?

17:57.720 --> 17:59.380
Somehow I don't think the King's

17:59.480 --> 18:01.330
royal planning is done from the dungeon.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.780
I have connections, for a price.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.127
You have money?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.931
I'll see what I can do.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.260
Hello, sugar love.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.800
Evening, Roland.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.000
Enjoy.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.220
What's it say?

18:55.320 --> 18:59.241
A servant will come, asking for a
volunteer to clean the stables.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.260
Say yes. He'll be sure you
have a moment with the King.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.607
Let me see that.

19:03.880 --> 19:08.009
- It's in code. You wouldn't understand.
- I paid for it. Let me see it.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.004
Don't be a brute.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.683
I could always have one of
the guards fetch it for me.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.645
That's a map of the castle.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.860
Yes, but I wasn't lying about
the servant and the stables.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.446
He comes every day.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.820
And what are you doing
with a map of the castle?

19:30.920 --> 19:34.681
My life's in grave danger.
You wouldn't understand.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.329
So you're not just innocent,
you're special.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.380
If you must know, I am Valina Raskov,

19:44.480 --> 19:47.126
part of the original sacred
blood family of Norvania.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.245
My family guided our
people for generations.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.807
Yannick's rise to power
changed all that.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.460
Let me guess.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.060
You tried to do something about it.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.260
Yes. Now the King's son wants to make

19:58.360 --> 20:00.642
a public spectacle of my death.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.322
If I don't get out of here soon,
he'll get his wish.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.526
You know Drazen?

20:06.480 --> 20:07.966
Please.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.300
One year ago, Drazen and I
were engaged to be married.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.940
Something smells very
familiar down here.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.486
Mathayus, it's so good to see
you back in a cage again.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.525
And look who's in the cage next door.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.740
The runaway bride.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.725
Obviously you need to work
on your relationship skills.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.460
You and I could still be partners,
if you weren't so loyal.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.205
Like a dog.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.206
Well, she's the one you
want to watch out for.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.564
You think I'm deceptive?

20:38.840 --> 20:43.090
She will reel you in and
rip out your heart.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.210
You're an animal.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.530
Then you shouldn't
have tried to tame me.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.609
I'll deal with you later.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.123
You and I are going
to have a cup of tea.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.370
I invented this.
We call it the Man Kettle.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.201
We like to see what bubbles up first,

21:10.320 --> 21:13.330
the truth or the tea.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.580
Now, I'm trying to understand
why you would come here,

21:16.680 --> 21:19.380
pretending to make peace with my father.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.409
I don't lie. You know that.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.131
You're a warrior and a killer.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.340
Aren't you the wrong man to
come here to offer us peace?

21:31.440 --> 21:33.369
That's exactly what I told King Zakkour.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.966
But he sent you anyway.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.762
I'm supposed to believe that?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.684
I betrayed you.

21:43.960 --> 21:47.926
I stole from you. I left you for dead.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.340
Admit it, you've come here to
kill me and steal back the urn.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.940
I come in peace.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.220
Well, you will leave in pieces.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.761
Now what do you really want?

21:59.400 --> 22:03.140
What I want is to rip out your heart,

22:03.240 --> 22:06.140
roast it, and eat it like a leg of lamb.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.620
Is that truth enough for you?

22:07.720 --> 22:08.980
- Yes.
- Yes.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.327
It is.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.500
It is only my pledge to King Zakkour
that keeps me from killing you.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.926
How honorable.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.660
I accept your offer of peace, Mathayus.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.042
Now, we celebrate.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.380
Guards. I'm sick.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.842
I need a doctor.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.842
Drink, boys. To peace.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.740
It takes a brave man
to look beyond himself

23:05.840 --> 23:08.168
and act for the good of his people.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.891
I have no people.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.660
I'm just here to finish a job.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.851
You see, Father, the great Scorpion
King is really just a hired killer.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.580
What he said about ripping
my heart out and eating it?

23:19.680 --> 23:21.450
That's the real Mathayus.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.445
Now, to make it official.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.240
- The King!
- No.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.050
- Father!
- No!

23:53.720 --> 23:55.206
Those are scorpions.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.126
Your own father?

24:00.560 --> 24:01.860
Who's the master now?

24:01.960 --> 24:04.561
In fact, I'm about to be king.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.449
Guards! Come now,
the King has been poisoned!

24:08.680 --> 24:10.086
Alcaman.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.124
Give me that. It's of no use to you.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.765
This man murdered my father.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.684
- Kill him!
- Wait!

24:22.040 --> 24:23.685
We haven't eaten dinner yet.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.606
- What?
- Who's hungry?

24:36.720 --> 24:37.967
Get him!

24:40.800 --> 24:42.525
How's it feel to be king?

24:53.600 --> 24:56.531
Stop him! Get him down!

25:04.680 --> 25:06.245
Cut him off!

25:23.920 --> 25:25.770
Come on, come on, come on!

25:26.640 --> 25:27.966
Kill him!

25:36.400 --> 25:39.820
Careful, Mathayus.
You are a pawn in a game of kings.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.442
No, I'm a warrior with a code of honor.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.540
He poisoned the King,
and now he's escaped.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.763
- Seal the gates.
- Right away.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.620
Please, let me rest here a while.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.443
Don't put me back in my cell.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.643
Come on, man! We need everyone!

26:27.640 --> 26:28.841
Wow.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.690
I'm suddenly feeling better.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.260
Do my spots look any different?

26:32.360 --> 26:33.561
Let me look.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.700
What are you doing?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.540
Escaping.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.569
- What are you doing?
- I'm escaping.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.940
That's what all the commotion's about.
They're chasing after you?

26:57.040 --> 26:58.020
Well, you're going the wrong way.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.900
- You don't wanna go that way.
- And you're ruining my escape.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.406
There they are!

27:06.520 --> 27:07.926
What happened to seeing the King?

27:08.920 --> 27:10.201
The King's dead.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.730
Drazen killed him.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.285
Well, feel free. Escape. Anytime.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.446
I think I will.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.725
What is that?

27:49.280 --> 27:50.925
It's a farewell gift from the King.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.806
Really?

27:53.240 --> 27:54.441
Good luck.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.246
Wait!

28:00.240 --> 28:01.300
Hey!

28:01.400 --> 28:02.647
Really?

28:34.640 --> 28:37.810
Don't mess with sugar love.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.180
Where's the party?

28:42.280 --> 28:45.290
It's a search party,
and it's searching for us.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.640
Let's go!

28:49.440 --> 28:51.051
See you on the outside, friend.

28:52.880 --> 28:54.320
Thanks, sugar love.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.980
I had this all planned out.
You ruined everything.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.900
- You're more than welcome to go alone.
- You've already ruined that option.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.645
Search everywhere.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.460
This might be the worst day of my life.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.780
The worst day of your life was
being locked in that dungeon.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.084
No, it wasn't. You know why?
Because you weren't there.

29:26.680 --> 29:27.881
Go!

29:31.120 --> 29:32.300
Now what?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.761
This way. This way. Let's go.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.380
What are you doing?

29:37.480 --> 29:39.140
You should be alert. Someone's escaping.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.044
- Who?
- Us.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.168
- Follow me. Hold on!
- No, no, no! No!

29:58.520 --> 29:59.620
There they are!

29:59.720 --> 30:01.285
Get off me!

30:01.840 --> 30:03.201
Get them!

30:03.600 --> 30:04.801
Come on, move!

30:08.360 --> 30:09.846
He's yours.

30:14.560 --> 30:15.807
Hurry up!

30:18.160 --> 30:19.300
Cut them off!

30:19.400 --> 30:22.080
Lower the gate. Lower the gate!

30:27.000 --> 30:29.885
Faster! Faster!

30:38.120 --> 30:39.367
Come on!

30:40.080 --> 30:42.044
Go, go, go, go, go!

30:42.600 --> 30:43.620
Hurry!

30:43.720 --> 30:45.251
Out of my way!

30:52.400 --> 30:54.011
We're trapped.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.249
- Found yourself another cage, Mathayus.
- Go!

30:57.160 --> 30:58.600
Open the gate!

31:00.440 --> 31:01.641
Quick! Quick! Quick!

31:05.200 --> 31:06.640
Move! Move!

31:06.920 --> 31:08.167
Gotcha!

31:23.920 --> 31:25.380
They've got nowhere to go, come on!

31:25.480 --> 31:27.170
Come on, men! Put your backs into it!

31:29.440 --> 31:30.687
They're trapped!

31:36.640 --> 31:38.888
It appears we took a wrong turn.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.900
You dare escape the wall?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.611
Faster!

31:47.320 --> 31:48.380
Why are you looking down?

31:48.480 --> 31:49.540
Just thinking.

31:49.640 --> 31:53.100
No, no, no, no. You go.
I am not jumping off of this...

32:13.240 --> 32:14.885
Archers!

32:21.040 --> 32:23.100
Get out of my way!

32:23.200 --> 32:24.401
Stop! No, no, no, no!

32:25.920 --> 32:28.580
Ready! Aim!

32:28.680 --> 32:31.247
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.940
Fire!

32:36.040 --> 32:40.245
I wish I never met you!

32:47.000 --> 32:49.282
Seriously? Again?

32:49.960 --> 32:51.685
Give me that!

32:52.440 --> 32:54.700
I told you I wouldn't jump.

32:54.800 --> 32:55.900
You didn't jump.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.600
- What do you mean, I didn't jump?
- I pushed you.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.726
I think that's his own cousin.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.646
- Like you've never done that!
- That's awkward.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.100
Well, look at you.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.300
I'm sorry.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.601
For what?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.040
For that.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.768
- Can you ride like you fight?
- Can you ride without groping me?

33:39.920 --> 33:41.406
Grope all you want.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.727
I got him!

33:55.560 --> 33:58.780
They're escaping. Gather the horses!
Prepare to chase!

33:58.880 --> 34:00.700
- No, let them go.
- Sire?

34:00.800 --> 34:06.040
I said, let them go.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.920
I know where they're going.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.900
You'll have to clean and
stitch that wound soon.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.900
My father lives near here. He can help.

34:15.000 --> 34:15.980
I'll be fine.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.964
He could also decode that key.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.540
That's the key of Lord Alcaman.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.820
It's one of the most powerful
objects in the world,

34:23.920 --> 34:25.260
if you know how to use it.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.244
I appreciate all you've done,
but I work better alone.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.060
Let my father unravel
the mysteries of that key.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.260
We can use its power to defeat Drazen

34:33.360 --> 34:36.210
and restore my family
to its rightful place.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.368
Well, here we are.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.940
One thing. Don't tell my
father who's after us.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.139
Daddy doesn't know that his
daughter crossed Drazen.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.940
It's best if we kept it quiet.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.924
He wouldn't understand.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.321
Father?

35:10.920 --> 35:12.360
Valina!

35:16.280 --> 35:17.686
Father.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.340
That's your father?

35:24.440 --> 35:25.980
This all makes so much more sense now.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.931
Valina! Did you see that?

35:29.720 --> 35:31.126
I flew.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.086
Well, I glided for a moment, anyway.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.607
The crash was perhaps not to be desired,

35:38.320 --> 35:42.411
but it proves that human
flight is possible.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.241
Who's this?

35:44.400 --> 35:47.490
Mathayus of Akkad, sir.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.681
What? An Akkadian,
in Norvania, with my daughter.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.260
Did she kidnap you?
You have to watch out for her.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.180
Father, he's hurt.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.940
And he needs our help.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.765
What?

36:07.880 --> 36:09.140
There you are. There.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.284
You see? This is what I
have been working on.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.487
Yeah, up here.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.687
It shows the potential for human flight.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.820
And this...

36:21.920 --> 36:26.020
This is my idea for a self-propelled,
people-moving carriage.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.780
My father, Sorrell Raskov,

36:27.880 --> 36:30.220
comes from a sacred line
of wise men and scholars

36:30.320 --> 36:32.761
who have guided the people
of this region for generations.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.890
He should be ruling Norvania.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.086
Not barbarians like
Drazen and his father.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.161
My daughter's been telling
her foolish stories again.

36:41.440 --> 36:46.521
Valina! Not every man
is destined to be king.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.126
- Oh! There you are.
- I'll have to agree with him on that one.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.363
Now, you, watch this.

36:54.560 --> 36:58.540
My entire house is powered by wind

36:59.960 --> 37:00.980
and water.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.980
Hey!

37:10.080 --> 37:11.500
You want to cut some wood?

37:11.600 --> 37:14.220
You can chop away all day,
without getting tired.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.060
I call it a "chop-o-matic."

37:17.160 --> 37:18.540
Over here.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.251
You see this?

37:20.560 --> 37:24.287
This hammer works alone.

37:26.320 --> 37:31.242
And this broom, here, cleans for
you while you just sit and relax.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.531
And if you're tired of
holding something heavy?

37:38.240 --> 37:41.444
I use magnets to make objects float.

37:44.960 --> 37:50.200
It's all about attraction
and repulsion. You see?

37:54.440 --> 37:55.641
Oh!

38:01.520 --> 38:04.690
Well, that needs work.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.220
We need you in the village, Father,

38:07.320 --> 38:10.300
leading a revolution. Claiming your
rightful place on the throne.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.420
Not again.

38:11.520 --> 38:15.020
So long as men like Yannick
and Drazen oppress us,

38:15.120 --> 38:16.860
this will always be a dream.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.401
Let me get this straight.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.580
Are we not talking about the same
man that you were going to marry?

38:22.680 --> 38:25.770
My plan was to start a rebellion
from inside the palace.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.645
By marrying the King's son?

38:27.920 --> 38:30.361
By getting a foothold
into the system of power.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.300
I just couldn't make
the full commitment.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.601
Why?

38:33.880 --> 38:35.445
You know,

38:36.720 --> 38:39.161
the wedding night commitment?

38:39.920 --> 38:42.407
I couldn't go through with it.
Not with Drazen.

38:42.880 --> 38:43.860
Blech.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.764
I left him at the altar at our wedding.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.380
Wedding! Young man.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.660
If you're here to ask for my
daughter's hand in marriage,

38:49.760 --> 38:51.540
I give you my full blessing.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.900
Let her be your disaster
waiting to happen.

38:54.000 --> 38:54.980
Father.

38:55.080 --> 38:58.180
It seems you two have a lot to talk about.
Maybe it's best if I just leave.

38:58.280 --> 38:59.420
No, wait.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.960
Sorry.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.340
Father, he's got something to show you.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.166
It's the reason I brought him here.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.167
Show him.

39:14.280 --> 39:17.324
Well, that's very pretty.
All it needs is a giant, golden key ring.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.700
It's the Golden Key of
Lord Alcaman. Isn't it?

39:20.800 --> 39:22.340
You told me about it as a child.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.500
I also told you that Lord Alcaman

39:24.600 --> 39:26.700
and all his grand powers didn't exist.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.460
You don't believe in Lord Alcaman?

39:28.560 --> 39:30.620
My father thinks that world mythology,

39:30.720 --> 39:34.180
all our monsters, gods and heroes,
are just campfire stories.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.180
Invented by men to frighten and rule us.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.020
Everything can be explained by science.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.180
Where'd you get this piece of junk?

39:41.280 --> 39:42.340
In the urn that...

39:42.440 --> 39:44.820
That he found in the woods,
by the marketplace.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.660
Only, he was attacked by thieves,

39:47.760 --> 39:50.691
so I saved him and brought him here.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.460
Do you know what the symbols mean?

39:54.560 --> 39:57.180
Well, legend holds that the
Golden Key of Lord Alcaman

39:57.280 --> 40:00.860
leads to the secret palace
where he kept his throne.

40:00.960 --> 40:06.371
Any man of honor who finds the
lost throne and dons the crown

40:07.160 --> 40:10.380
will unlock all of the magic

40:10.480 --> 40:12.444
and ascends to the throne

40:12.680 --> 40:14.564
as king of the world!

40:15.880 --> 40:17.140
Of course, it's all made up.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.740
The man that attacked me is dangerous.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.460
If he gets his hands on the crown, he will
use its powers for evil and personal gain.

40:23.560 --> 40:27.300
Well, with the right amount of power,
every man is dangerous.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.020
Do you see that, Father?
Those are words of a king.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.740
- I don't want to be king!
- Yes, you do.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.100
- No, I do not.
- Yes, you do!

40:33.200 --> 40:36.180
No, in fact, I don't want anything!

40:36.280 --> 40:37.527
Yes, you do.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.780
You want to prove that Lord Alcaman,

40:39.880 --> 40:41.650
one of the great myths of world history,

40:41.960 --> 40:43.571
is nothing but a campfire story.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.700
I'll decipher this,

40:48.800 --> 40:52.721
and I will prove to you there
is no such thing as magic.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.449
Rooster tails have a bit...

40:58.680 --> 41:00.220
Well, it's a riddle!

41:00.320 --> 41:01.646
Did you ever fight for something,

41:02.040 --> 41:05.847
even though you had no idea
how you were going to win?

41:07.040 --> 41:08.651
Story of my life.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.088
I plan to make that my story, as well.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.169
Just to be clear.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.300
If your father gets us to
the throne of Lord Alcaman,

41:18.400 --> 41:19.780
if there's a crown,

41:19.880 --> 41:22.606
then I'll be taking it back
to King Zakkour in Al-Moraad.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.448
You can have Norvania.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.211
Do you plan to kill Drazen?

41:27.760 --> 41:29.086
On my honor.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.446
Then we have a deal.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.660
That... It's riddles. It's riddles!

41:36.760 --> 41:37.780
It's riddles!

41:37.880 --> 41:40.606
I have deciphered the code!

41:41.440 --> 41:43.140
At least the first part.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.569
Excellent. Father,
let's pack for an adventure.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.500
- I'll bring around the horses.
- An adventure!

41:48.600 --> 41:51.371
An adventure! What shall I bring?

41:52.080 --> 41:53.060
Let's go.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.361
Well, you'll need this.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.809
Mathayus of Akkad, Scorpion King,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.043
you are guilty of the
murder of my father.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.540
Murder?

42:07.640 --> 42:08.887
Scorpion King?

42:09.360 --> 42:10.971
It's a long story.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.010
The kind your father doesn't believe in.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.608
He's done it. He's cracked the code.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.208
It leads to the village
of Glenrrossovia.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.580
Sorrell Raskov,
you really are one smart man.

42:24.680 --> 42:27.008
And you are a pig, Drazen.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.100
Too bad none of your intelligence
was passed on to your daughter.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.801
A pig who lives in a
castle is still a pig.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.361
Oink, oink.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.409
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.100
- Boris.
- Sire.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.643
Keep this safe. Guard it with your life.

42:54.920 --> 42:55.940
Sire.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.500
That key can't turn
you into a king, Drazen.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.370
And your father knew that.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.282
Isn't that why you killed him?

43:04.160 --> 43:05.521
Liar.

43:05.640 --> 43:08.525
This man is an assassin and
he wanted my father's throne.

43:08.640 --> 43:12.100
The only man who deserves that
throne is the man sitting next to me.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.129
In the bird suit.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.768
Who's probably smarter
than all of us combined.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.660
Then he can be the smartest
man in the afterlife,

43:18.760 --> 43:21.008
and you can be his loyal dog.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.491
Burn it down.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.940
The Scorpion King?
Legendary warrior from across the sands.

43:38.040 --> 43:39.940
I thought you were a campfire story.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.260
Sorry to disappoint you.

43:41.360 --> 43:42.420
No!

43:42.520 --> 43:45.801
- Well, did you kill Yannick?
- No. Drazen killed him.

43:46.560 --> 43:49.580
Perhaps this is information you could
have shared before he caught up with us.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.611
- I was afraid you wouldn't help.
- And you would have been right.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.247
What are you doing?

44:02.520 --> 44:03.620
I'm turning this on.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.740
The chop-o-matic?

44:04.840 --> 44:06.041
Yes.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.725
The saw-o-matic.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.300
Go!

44:10.400 --> 44:12.060
Be careful!

44:12.160 --> 44:13.620
To the right. Just a little more.

44:13.720 --> 44:14.700
Yeah.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.340
Wait! To the left.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.060
- A little back. Back.
- Yes.

44:18.160 --> 44:21.220
No, no, just a little more.
No, just to the left. No, just...

44:21.320 --> 44:22.965
Back to the right.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.606
That's good.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.601
Wish me luck.

44:35.520 --> 44:38.460
You know, Drazen doesn't
understand the clue.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.125
He thinks it's the village. That's all.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.570
But you withheld the exact location.
He'll never find it.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.140
Let's go! Quickly!

44:50.240 --> 44:52.249
- My father's designs.
- Too late.

44:52.840 --> 44:54.610
We have to get there before Drazen.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.940
Let's go. Quickly.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.241
Oh.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.571
I'm sorry.

45:17.600 --> 45:23.603
All kneel in the presence of
King Drazen, ruler of Norvania!

45:25.480 --> 45:29.002
Good people of Glenrrossovia,
now please, stand.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.444
My father has been murdered.

45:33.800 --> 45:37.527
His killer was a foreign assassin
known as the Scorpion King.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.121
He was working with two other traitors,

45:40.480 --> 45:42.842
Valina and Sorrell Raskov.

45:43.560 --> 45:46.001
Before my men killed them this morning,

45:46.480 --> 45:49.331
they gave up the secret to this village.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.020
You there, come here.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.900
- No. No, no, no.
- I'm okay.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.900
Stay there. Stay there.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.487
Will you be a loyal subject
and help your king?

45:59.680 --> 46:00.860
Yes, My Lord.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.740
Tell me where Alcaman's palace is.
I know it's here.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.201
I don't know any...

46:07.560 --> 46:09.780
Am I not making myself clear?

46:09.880 --> 46:13.641
I know the palace is hidden in
this village, so take me there.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.540
Look, it's the key.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.020
You've done a good job protecting...

46:18.120 --> 46:19.420
How do we get it?

46:19.520 --> 46:22.100
We can't fight them. We're outnumbered.

46:22.200 --> 46:26.007
Now prove yourself smart
and tell me where it is.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.900
Please, I beg you. Don't kill me.

46:30.160 --> 46:33.330
I'm not gonna kill you.
I have a job for you.

46:33.880 --> 46:35.060
And a gold coin if you get it done.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.010
Show me where it is!

46:37.280 --> 46:40.580
You! Something you wanna tell me?

46:40.680 --> 46:42.405
No, no, no, no.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.124
- Let me hear it?
- I don't know anything.

46:46.240 --> 46:49.523
I promise you, My Lord.
I know nothing of any palace.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.004
Feel free to stop me, anyone.

46:53.480 --> 46:57.526
Before there's no secret
and no village left to save!

47:02.640 --> 47:05.100
Whatever powers are held, they have...

47:05.200 --> 47:08.404
They can be used to protect
you or destroy you.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.930
Take our horses, water them and
have them ready when we call.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.771
Do you understand?

47:15.040 --> 47:17.288
...you are all as good as dead.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.451
The temple of the Goddess.

47:26.120 --> 47:28.380
The palace of Lord Alcaman
is under that fat lady?

47:28.480 --> 47:30.540
Well, maybe not the palace,
but according to the riddles,

47:30.640 --> 47:33.020
inside of the temple
is a slot for your key.

47:33.120 --> 47:36.020
And it's not a fat lady.
It's a divine goddess.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.060
Yup.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.420
- Where are the other gods?
- What others?

47:39.520 --> 47:42.020
You know, the God of the Sun,
the God of the Dead,

47:42.120 --> 47:43.924
the God of War. The men.

47:44.400 --> 47:48.180
We pray to one god in these parts,
and she is the only one we need.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.606
Fine.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.850
You can't go in there.
It's for women only.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.766
Give me the key. I'll do it.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.281
Not a chance.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.366
This is a holy place.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.860
Any man enters the sanctuary,
the High Priestess

48:04.960 --> 48:07.288
will sound the alarm and the
village will descend upon us.

48:07.520 --> 48:10.007
Along with Drazen and his men.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.085
You're still not getting the key.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.921
Have it your way.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.245
Hurry up, guys. Don't be shy.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.420
You look lovely.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.643
Are you sure Drazen didn't
leave you at the altar?

48:32.960 --> 48:35.049
I find it quite comfortable.

48:58.360 --> 49:00.642
I see why they don't
let the men in here.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.740
I suddenly became religious.

49:10.880 --> 49:16.120
I mean, oh, my, what a beautiful temple.

49:17.160 --> 49:21.365
That's the inner sanctuary,
for those with extreme afflictions.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.801
Who's that?

49:23.560 --> 49:25.888
The High Priestess, Feminina.

49:26.720 --> 49:29.605
And, no, she's not
hiding a keyhole either.

49:30.160 --> 49:33.569
Look, the Divine Goddess
has a divine belly button.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.363
- That does look like a keyhole.
- Yeah.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.729
Welcome to the temple
of the Divine Goddess.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.460
For what do you pray?

49:44.560 --> 49:48.287
My sister is sick. She needs help.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.967
You and your mother seem healthy, but...

49:55.560 --> 49:57.380
She does not seem well.

49:57.480 --> 49:59.220
She's deathly ill.

49:59.320 --> 50:03.340
The sickness has left her
deformed and hideous.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.130
It's not that bad.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.180
Oh, it's bad.

50:07.280 --> 50:08.970
She'll need some special healing.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.648
Very well, follow me.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.121
My pleasure.

50:17.320 --> 50:19.921
Dear sister. You poor, sick thing.

50:20.240 --> 50:21.740
Too sick to even walk.

50:24.560 --> 50:26.808
Repeat after me.

50:27.960 --> 50:29.940
Divine Goddess,

50:30.040 --> 50:33.847
our sister has been afflicted
with a hideous disease.

50:34.360 --> 50:36.180
Divine Goddess,

50:36.280 --> 50:40.420
our sister is afflicted
with a hideous disease.

50:40.520 --> 50:42.940
Use our bodies to heal her.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.020
Touch her intimately through our mouths

50:46.120 --> 50:49.210
and our bosoms and our wombs.

50:49.440 --> 50:53.201
Use our bodies to heal her.

50:53.440 --> 50:57.260
Touch her intimately through our mouths,

50:57.360 --> 51:01.121
our bosoms and our wombs.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.220
You really don't sound well.

51:04.320 --> 51:08.809
I'm not. I need to be
healed immediately.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.420
Sister, lay your hands on me

51:20.520 --> 51:23.883
that we might join our
bodies in intimate prayer.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.045
I thought you'd never ask.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.201
But we don't have time.

51:31.200 --> 51:32.380
What's going on?

51:32.480 --> 51:34.728
I'm suddenly feeling much better.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.684
Oh, my.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.005
Calm down, sister.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.860
What are you doing? Get away from her.

51:45.960 --> 51:48.020
- Don't worry. It only hurts for a moment.
- That's obscene.

51:48.120 --> 51:51.483
Divine Goddess, meet the
Golden Key of Lord Alcaman.

51:59.720 --> 52:00.900
Maybe it's a different hole?

52:07.520 --> 52:08.926
It has to be here.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.924
Do I have to carve it out of you?

52:19.320 --> 52:22.420
Take me to Alcaman's Palace!

52:29.920 --> 52:32.009
That must be it. Bring the key.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.681
Was that us?

52:33.840 --> 52:34.980
What have we done?

52:44.040 --> 52:45.321
What's happening?

52:48.120 --> 52:49.180
Do you believe in magic now?

52:49.280 --> 52:52.165
I must admit, we have stumbled
onto something quite unusual.

52:53.440 --> 52:54.620
It's the Goddess.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.809
She's transporting us to heaven.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.220
It's not the Goddess.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.284
It's the power of Lord Alcaman.
The legend is real.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.811
Why? Why are you doing this to us?

53:07.600 --> 53:09.100
No! You fool. It's steam.

53:09.200 --> 53:12.060
There must be a natural pocket
of steam underneath the temple,

53:12.160 --> 53:13.660
and the key unlocked a vent.

53:13.760 --> 53:15.620
God! It's brilliant.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.140
That's what's lifting us?

53:17.240 --> 53:21.126
He's harnessed the natural
power of thermal energy!

53:21.480 --> 53:23.170
You know, hot water!

53:23.440 --> 53:25.300
You're not supposed to be alive!

53:25.400 --> 53:27.140
And you're not supposed to be king.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.522
But we'll sort all this out
when I come back to kill you.

53:31.440 --> 53:32.980
Smash it down.

53:33.080 --> 53:34.620
I said, smash it down!

53:34.720 --> 53:36.285
Go! Go!

53:36.600 --> 53:37.860
The pillar.

53:37.960 --> 53:39.571
Bring the pillar down!

53:40.000 --> 53:42.168
Put your backs into it, come on!

53:48.960 --> 53:50.969
Don't let them escape!

54:01.000 --> 54:02.860
Why don't I see a palace here?

54:02.960 --> 54:04.780
Or a throne? Or a crown? Or a...

54:04.880 --> 54:06.491
What are you talking about?

54:06.760 --> 54:07.900
I do.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.201
Right there.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.567
My big-boned friend, you're right.

54:13.600 --> 54:14.900
That's the crown?

54:15.000 --> 54:17.487
No, it's another clue. You see?

54:17.840 --> 54:19.420
- Way out there?
- Yes.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.900
Way, way, way out there.

54:22.000 --> 54:22.980
What does it say?

54:23.080 --> 54:26.100
"Silver, gold, silver, gold,

54:26.200 --> 54:29.882
"step-by-step, the path unfolds."

54:30.200 --> 54:31.526
Makes no sense.

54:31.960 --> 54:33.580
But one thing is clear.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.380
The man who is sending us
on this wild goose chase

54:36.480 --> 54:38.648
is pointing us in that direction.

54:42.560 --> 54:43.841
This thing's gonna fall.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.260
We have to get out of here.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.050
How? How?

54:50.200 --> 54:52.129
How dare you?

54:53.080 --> 54:54.406
Can I borrow this?

55:21.880 --> 55:23.844
Now I've got you.

55:29.040 --> 55:32.130
This is why we don't allow men.

55:38.720 --> 55:39.900
The boy should have our horses ready.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.249
Yeah, if he hasn't stolen them by now.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.380
There they are!

55:47.480 --> 55:48.780
- Get them!
- Go back.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.127
That's them! Move!

55:51.680 --> 55:52.740
Go! Go! Go!

55:52.840 --> 55:54.087
Psst! This way.

55:54.600 --> 55:55.801
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

55:55.960 --> 55:57.321
Now move!

56:02.680 --> 56:03.881
This way!

56:04.840 --> 56:06.644
There! After them!

56:26.040 --> 56:27.300
To our horses.

56:27.400 --> 56:28.886
Quick. Now.

56:37.640 --> 56:39.444
You idiots!

56:42.440 --> 56:45.007
I want more grog!

56:48.160 --> 56:49.180
Why are we here again?

56:49.280 --> 56:51.700
He's got to be around here somewhere.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.923
My, my, my.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.220
Sugar love.

56:55.320 --> 56:59.206
You said I'd see you on
the outside, and here you are.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.320
Yes.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.740
This is my father, Sorrell.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.780
And you remember my other
friend from the castle, don't you?

57:08.880 --> 57:11.260
Yeah, they're calling you
"the King Slayer."

57:11.360 --> 57:13.420
Not that I mind, but it makes you

57:13.520 --> 57:15.740
for a rather dangerous drinking buddy.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.380
We need another map.

57:17.480 --> 57:20.980
And, sugar love over here
said that you can get one for us.

57:21.080 --> 57:22.380
Hey, sweetheart!

57:22.480 --> 57:24.460
She knows how I do business.

57:24.560 --> 57:26.489
Payment up front.

57:27.960 --> 57:30.100
Well, we may need to negotiate.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.890
What do you have in mind?

57:32.240 --> 57:33.260
I think it would be...

57:33.360 --> 57:34.561
We're on a quest

57:35.360 --> 57:37.020
for gold.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.460
If you help us, provide us with a map

57:39.560 --> 57:41.489
and your ax, if it gets dangerous,

57:42.280 --> 57:44.721
then your cut will be one-quarter.

57:46.520 --> 57:48.484
Let me see what I can do.

57:49.720 --> 57:51.490
Sire.

57:52.440 --> 57:54.244
We found their horses.

57:56.040 --> 57:59.140
If the key is lost, you will
pay for it with your life.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.540
Our scouts assure me, the fugitives

58:01.640 --> 58:04.081
are not headed south toward Al-Moraad.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.020
I know him.

58:06.120 --> 58:08.060
He'll try and cross through the forest

58:08.160 --> 58:10.020
and go for the throne
of Alcaman himself.

58:10.120 --> 58:13.300
Mathayus must have the key!

58:13.400 --> 58:16.365
Maybe they've been able to
decipher the other markings on it.

58:48.440 --> 58:51.689
Well, well, well, my friends.

58:51.960 --> 58:54.500
Look what the rat has dragged in.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.723
Gorak, it's been way too long.

58:57.320 --> 59:01.650
Roland, you seek a
rare and special item.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.580
A map that does not even exist.

59:05.680 --> 59:07.500
Aye, it does not exist.

59:07.600 --> 59:08.980
But if it did exist,

59:09.080 --> 59:12.727
it'd be the only way to get past
the dragon who guards the forest.

59:13.080 --> 59:14.380
And I brought gold.

59:14.480 --> 59:16.603
Well, I love gold, my friend.

59:16.760 --> 59:20.760
But this map is a one
of a kind, my friend.

59:21.640 --> 59:23.300
How much do you want?

59:23.400 --> 59:27.300
Gold only exists to satisfy the flesh.

59:27.400 --> 59:31.380
That is the nature of
my business, my other friend.

59:31.480 --> 59:32.580
What are you saying?

59:32.680 --> 59:36.100
The girl fights for the map, my friend.

59:36.200 --> 59:37.780
- Not gonna happen.
- No, no, no.

59:37.880 --> 59:38.900
She's not fighting for the map.

59:39.000 --> 59:39.980
Valina!

59:40.080 --> 59:41.281
- I'll fight.
- No.

59:43.320 --> 59:45.761
Call Chancara!

59:55.920 --> 59:57.260
You don't have to do this.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.164
We need that map.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.043
Then kick her ass.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.820
A special treat tonight, my friends!

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.884
A special fight tonight!

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.243
We have before us,

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.484
the challenger, Valina.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.961
What do you fight for,
Valina, my friend?

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.220
A map.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.060
And challenging Valina
is the lovely and sweet

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.300
Chancara!

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.606
What do you fight for,
Chancara, my friend?

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.644
To kill Valina.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.620
Great.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.924
You may begin, my friends.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.806
Lovely to meet you.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.803
- Valina!
- Kick her ass, sugar love!

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.806
Get up, Valina.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.166
Valina!

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.289
Come on, sugar love.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.521
Valina!

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.721
No.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.767
Come on, Valina!

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.089
I might eat you after you're dead.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.806
Come on, Valina.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.124
How's that for an appetizer?

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.170
Perhaps you'd prefer the main course.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.485
Thank you.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.481
Awesome.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.921
Yes.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.164
You're a skilled fighter, my friend.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.540
But you have damaged my
favorite wife and business.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.640
For that, there will have
to be more gold, my friend.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.160
I am not your friend.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.620
It's the Tugarin Forest.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.048
There's a dragon that
guards these lands.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.689
According to the map,
this is where we enter.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.240
May the will of the great goddess
watch over us in our journey.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.204
That, and the will of my sword.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.888
Bend the trees. Don't break them.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.043
What, are you afraid
of hurting a few trees?

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.562
No, I'm afraid of being tracked.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.925
Do you hear something?

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.207
No, it's just a feeling.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.567
There's something out there. Let's move.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.100
It's fresh.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.380
They may be a half a day ahead of us.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.648
This way, men. Onward.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.740
Am I speaking in a foreign language?
I said, onward.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.140
Sire, that's the Tugarin Forest.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.500
We'll never get past the
great dragon, nor will Mathayus.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.860
Then we'll die trying,
just like Mathayus.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.605
Now move!

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.260
Still feel something out there?
Dragon, perhaps?

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.450
Dragon, Drazen, Gorak.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.020
We've got a lot of
enemies to choose from.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.765
Yeah, no kidding.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.380
So?

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.170
What?

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.331
The fight.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.690
I've been preparing for
this for a long time.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.660
My destiny.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.121
I understand that.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.245
So?

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.860
What?

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.642
Why do they call you the Scorpion King?

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.003
Because I'm as charming
as a poisonous insect.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.860
Honestly.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.380
Well, if you can believe it, years ago,
I was on the run from another evil warlord,

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.540
who also wanted me dead.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.730
Somehow, I can believe it.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.210
There was a battle,

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.220
and I was hit by an arrow that
was tipped with scorpion venom.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.380
And I should have died,

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.288
but there was a sorceress
that brought me back to life.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.740
She told me that the
blood of the scorpion

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.140
would forever flow through my veins.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.283
And for that, I owe her.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.888
She was special to you.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.580
Yes.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.090
Cassandra became my wife, my queen.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.050
And then she died.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.886
Like everyone else that's close to me.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.287
Guess you can say that's my destiny.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.247
Destinies can change.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.004
If you really want them to.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.241
That's not a bird.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.325
What is it?

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.779
Hello?

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.207
We're just travelers passing through.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.247
We don't want any trouble.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.841
Nothing.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.220
We can take these guys.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.660
Well, at least you can't
blame me for this one.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.724
I'm sure I'll come up with something.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.140
The tall guy must be their king.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.020
I serve King Zakkour of Al-Moraad.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.380
You are a mighty king,
but you have made a mistake.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:50.920
Yes.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.700
We have gold, worthy
of a king such as yourself.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.331
Yes.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.844
Why are you speaking
to my little brother?

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.980
I am Chief Onus,

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:10.966
leader of the Tugarin tribe
and protector of this forest.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.020
Praise the great spirit of this forest.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.860
We give you the souls
of these trespassers

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.848
so that you may smile down
upon us with all your bounty!

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.500
What are they doing?

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.689
Preparing us for sacrifice.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.060
To what?

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.850
I'm guessing whatever's in that box.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.900
Father! I love you!

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.202
I love you, too, Valina.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.129
They heard you.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.682
All praise he who speaks to
the creatures of the forest.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.220
All praise!

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.380
All praise! All praise!

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.763
All praise!

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.300
Years ago, there was a king

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.900
who united all the nations
of the world under his reign,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.248
because he conquered them all.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.020
On the top of that mountain lies a crown

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.688
that guarantees the power
rest with me in Norvania.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.980
I would gladly give
my life for Norvania.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.940
And when the time comes,

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.049
I expect you to do the same.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.601
Yes, yes.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.420
So, you believe in magic now?

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.820
It's not magic. You've all
heard of the horse whisperer?

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.522
This is very similar. It's an
advanced form of communication.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.086
That's all.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.380
Clearly, it's a tribal custom that
means they've accepted us.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.681
Clearly.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.900
Oh, no, no.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.300
- Not me.
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.523
Do you really wanna offend our hosts?

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.610
Of course not.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.687
I knew you had it in you.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.166
We've looked over your map.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.420
The only way to reach
this mountain's summit

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.087
is to pass through the lair
of the Tugarin dragon.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.860
I thought you were the Tugarin dragon.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.580
We look like dragon?

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.300
We protect our forest
home from strangers.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.500
The dragon protects the
mountain with equal passion.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.980
But I assure you, he is very real.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.620
Then I shall be meeting him soon.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.740
You believe there is palace up there?

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.860
Palace full of witchcraft and wizardry?

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.642
Well, for all of our sakes,
we better hope so.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.087
This is it, lair of the dragon.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.260
You still don't believe?

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.700
In man's ability to fool himself? Yes.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.980
In dragons?

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.566
No.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.820
Father, please.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.724
Poo!

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.326
Whoo!

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.642
You see? Nothing.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.687
Hello, Mr. Dragon.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.820
What's that?

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.300
It's just your imaginations gone wild.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.491
There's no such thing as big,
old, scary dragons.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.920
Oh, come on. You're trying to tell me...

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.681
Run!

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.247
Run!

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.420
Still think it's just a campfire story?

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.122
Hell, no. I just got roasted
by a fire-breathing dragon.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.020
Any of you have ideas?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.220
What, how to kill a dragon?

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.660
Yes.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.140
I have one.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.930
What?

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.340
Last chance to walk away.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.007
That's one skill I've never mastered.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.380
You're not gonna splat me
against that wall, are you?

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.605
Well, by my calculations, no.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.127
Pardon me, Sir Dragon.
Could you please look this way?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.964
- Go.
- Wait for it.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.004
Wait for it.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.606
Now!

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.930
Sorry!

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.300
I forgot to carry the one.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.881
Go, go, go, go.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.340
They say, the second time's the charm.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.980
Never heard that one.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.420
They say it.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.780
All right, big boy. Here comes dinner.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.605
You really have to put it that way?

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.207
Now!

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.801
Yes!

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.367
Mathayus! Be careful!

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.260
Puncture the ocular cavity!

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.700
That means "eye"!

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.300
I think he knows what it...

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.601
The eye!

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.220
Yes, yes.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.885
Yeah.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.890
You got him.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.380
Are you okay?

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.681
Yeah.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.500
It's amazing. Amazing!

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.565
It's a system of ropes and pulleys.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.500
It's powered by an underground stream.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.885
And those stones are scales,
which set the beast in motion.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.340
It's just another man-made illusion.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.820
I don't understand.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.740
Why build a mechanical beast

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.620
when you have all the magical
powers of Lord Alcaman?

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.651
Well, my bushy friend,
I feel we are about to find out.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.020
This guy, Alcaman,
sure loves his surprises.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.820
All right, this is where
the stained glass pointed.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:29.125
This is nothing.
This is just a wall of rock.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.924
Maybe it's just an illusion,
another of Alcaman's tricks.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.820
Do you have any other riddles?

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.531
Well.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.020
"A man with honor shall wear it right,

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:46.130
"the man without shall harvest ice."

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.980
Wait, here's one.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.180
"The key to success is rooted in stone."

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.962
There's certainly a lot of stone here.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.780
Yes.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.651
But there's only one thing rooted in it.

01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.765
Anybody home?

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.566
It's real. I don't believe it.
It's real.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.925
There it is.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.681
The lost throne of Lord Alcaman.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.929
Looks like your campfire
story came true.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.340
There's only one thing missing.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.540
Yes, what's that?

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.410
The crown.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.060
The crown?

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.407
I'm guessing it's in there.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.860
Finally, he made one thing easy to find.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.500
Too bad it won't be yours.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.325
What are you doing?

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.844
One step closer, and I'll kill her.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.606
I'm trading up.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.540
Roland, are you insane?

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.660
You're outnumbered.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.780
Oh, yeah?

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.580
Let me introduce you to my friends.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.620
Hide.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.860
Get away from me.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.060
Wait.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.900
I believe you've already met my friends.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.363
Give me some sugar, love.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.620
You lead them here the whole time.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.922
And you lead me to the lost throne.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.811
Seize her!

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.685
Mathayus.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.380
My, my, my.

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.729
Look at this.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.643
You may think you're the
better warrior, Mathayus.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.722
But I'm gonna be the better king.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.485
In fact, I'm gonna be
the king of all kings.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.568
By the power of Alcaman!

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.380
This is going to be fun.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:47.206
Mathayus, I owe you a great deal.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.580
In fact, I will mark your
grave with a word of thanks.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.180
You fool!

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:14.140
It's not magic. It's science!

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.408
It's just another trick. It's a...

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.260
It's the room.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.500
Those coats are magnetic attraction.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.340
And the floor is magnetic repulsion.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.449
You saw in my workshop.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.561
Father!

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.727
All of you, stand down!

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.731
Leave him to me.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.166
No, no. No, you're okay. You're okay.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.206
Mathayus!

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.810
What's the matter, Scorpion King?

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.123
No match for the jacket?

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.891
This way.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.367
No!

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.251
Come on! Get over here!

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.165
You could have shared all this with me.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:07.884
Now the crown and everything
else will be mine.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.500
And my wench of a fiancée
will finally be dead.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.481
Boo.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.689
Don't call Valina a wench.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.420
Get back, get back, get back. Move it.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.688
Stay back. It's opening.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.727
Look at me. I'm rich! Rich! Rich!

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.241
Go! Help him.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.527
"Rooster tails have a bitter end."

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.940
It's another trick.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.580
That's all there is,
Mathayus, is tricks.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.281
There's illusions, and there's science.

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.820
"Rooster tails have a bitter end.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.660
"Seek what's missing
through me, my friend."

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.644
Wait, say that second half again.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.249
"Seek what's missing
through me, my friend."

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.761
Through me?

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.140
Only the crown can save him now.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.442
Time to make magic.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.300
Stay with us.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.647
Wish me luck.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.284
Come on, sire. Get up.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.842
Bring some rope, Boris.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.683
Come on, quickly.

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.009
I'm coming for you, Mathayus!

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.900
Valina.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.281
Yes.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.900
This man, Mathayus...

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.089
Father, he's not...

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.928
He has a good heart.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.611
"Silver and gold, step-by-step,
the path unfolds.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:13.687
"Silver and gold."

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.689
Okay, men! This way!

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.848
I hate to leave you, Valina.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.860
Don't say that, Father.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:05.606
Mathayus will find the crown.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.687
My sweet, silly little girl.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.491
There's no such thing as magic.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.128
Hurry up! Come on.

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:32.121
Boris, you are my most trusted commander.
Step forward.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.161
Sire.

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.540
Lisgar.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.900
You are now my most trusted commander.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.680
Sire, I'm more of a follower.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.923
That crown is mine!

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.566
Valina.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.725
You must hurry, Mathayus!

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.805
It's over, partner.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:37.100
The power is finally mine.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:41.962
I was born to be a king,
and now I will live like a god.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.727
What's happening?

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.220
What's happening?

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.820
"The man with honor shall wear it right,

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:05.488
"the man without shall harvest ice."

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.046
You can't wear the crown, Drazen.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.769
You're not honorable.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.806
But you are cold as ice.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.170
Takes more than a sword
and a crown to be king.

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.760
Valina.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.420
Quickly.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.609
It's too late. He's dead.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.820
If only he could have seen it,
he would've finally believed it.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.804
Maybe we can still convince him.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.845
Father?

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.841
Father.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.409
What have you done?

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.940
I've proven you wrong, old man.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:52.340
No, it can't be.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.722
It can be. You know why?

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:56.960
Because it's magic.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.840
You look pretty good in that thing.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:08.566
It's real.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.800
And Lord Alcaman knew it was too
powerful to fall into the wrong hands.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.444
Into anyone's hands.

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:46.860
You're too late.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.561
The battle's over. Drazen is dead.

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.323
What about the crown?
The power of Lord Alcaman?

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.700
Turns out, it was just a campfire story.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.860
Smoke and mirrors.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.605
A myth.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:19.860
By the power entrusted to me by
the people and laws of the kingdom,

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.220
I crown you King Sorrell of Norvania.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.020
My daughter speaks to me of a destiny,

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.780
and she's taught me to believe in it.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.971
Now I take this opportunity
to help destiny unfold.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.100
I crown you Queen Valina of Norvania.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.449
It is her destiny.

01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:13.260
And I pledge to build a nation

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.740
based upon the principles
of science and mathematics,

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:19.420
of truth and reason,

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:23.930
and just a little bit of magic.

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.780
King Zakkour, as my
daughter is new at this,

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.900
it might be helpful to have a more
experienced statesman in her court.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.460
You know, someone dependable, honorable.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.444
Someone who works well with others.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.851
Well, I am sworn to Al-Moraad.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.580
You kept your oath,

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:34.724
but you are free to stay with
the Queen, in her service.

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:37.402
The Queen demands it.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:46.580
Long live Norvania!

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.609
Norvania!

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.860
I am definitely picking my own uniform.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.207
Good idea.

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.900
What? This isn't a dress.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:02.980
Whatever you say.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.260
Of course not.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.562
Looks like a dress to me.

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.320
Looks good on him.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.209
Speaking of dresses.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.524
Heathen.
