00:20.360 --> 00:24.040
A few words for the press,
Mr Flambeau. Mr Flambeau!

00:24.080 --> 00:25.680
A few words for the press!

00:27.560 --> 00:31.600
Hercule Flambeau -
our star prisoner.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.920
Unshackle me,
I'll give you an autograph.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.280
Ooh!

00:38.720 --> 00:41.960
Any more of your smart mouth
and the next one's across the jaw.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.560
You're a man of God?

01:21.800 --> 01:23.400
My whole life.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.640
You'll need him where you're going.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.280
That's enough!

02:30.960 --> 02:32.040
Into to your cells.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.280
Here... reading material.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.320
I'm here to see Hercule Flambeau.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.640
Father Brown?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.120
Yes.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.799
I'm here to see...
I know what you're here for.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.559
Governor wants to see you first.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.040
Arms, please.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.800
Turn.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.920
Oops.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.680
It's for personal use.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.560
Follow me.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.480
Come in.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.480
He had this on him.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.480
A priest with a lock pick?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.560
Always getting locked out of
the presbytery.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.000
I'll look after that, shall I?

05:05.040 --> 05:08.880
Flambeau has requested you as his
chaplain. Why?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.920
We have history.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.960
You're his spiritual advisor?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.759
I try to be.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.440
Must be an uphill task.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.279
By all accounts, he's a sociopath.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.480
And now a murderer.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.840
No-one is beyond redemption.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.480
You should try working in the
prison service for a few years,

05:30.520 --> 05:31.800
see if that's how you feel.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.879
Amen to that, sir.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.360
Much as we'd like to be
a place of rehabilitation,

05:36.400 --> 05:38.720
the truth is far uglier.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.000
Men are not sent here to be
rehabilitated.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.239
They're sent here to be punished.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.639
Flambeau hasn't been tried yet.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.240
He may be innocent.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.440
Have you read this? Yes.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.640
Doesn't seem very innocent to me.
No.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.519
You're not to go anywhere without an
escort. Do you understand?

06:01.520 --> 06:02.880
Yes.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.520
Thank you, Mitchell.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.040
Chapel's this way. Chapel?

06:25.080 --> 06:27.680
It's where he spends most
of his time.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.760
If he gives you any trouble,
just call and I'll come running.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.880
You answered my call.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.800
How could I refuse?

06:48.840 --> 06:50.840
Given my past
transgressions against you,

06:50.880 --> 06:52.640
you have every right to refuse.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.320
And turn my back on an old
acquaintance?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.800
Acquaintance?
Is that all I am to you?

07:03.840 --> 07:06.080
What would you prefer? Friend?

07:06.120 --> 07:08.280
Ally. Depends on what you want.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.920
Your counsel, nothing more.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.119
When have you ever asked for
my counsel?

07:14.120 --> 07:16.440
When have I ever been charged with
murder?

07:19.320 --> 07:21.000
Did you do it?

07:22.840 --> 07:26.400
You've read the papers.
What do you think?

07:26.440 --> 07:29.440
You were seen arguing with
Flynn Hardwick on

07:29.480 --> 07:31.279
the night of his disappearance.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.680
He was trying to swindle me.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.759
Cross words were spoken,
but it's purely circumstantial.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.879
And his wife saw you dumping his
body in the river.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.200
She's either mistaken or lying.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.920
Besides, no body's been discovered.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.080
For all we know, my business
associate's lying drunk

07:46.120 --> 07:47.400
in a ditch somewhere.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.760
And his blood was on your shirt.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.600
Planted.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.679
Forgive me for saying,

07:57.680 --> 08:01.240
but if you are innocent,
why this sudden devotion to prayer?

08:09.520 --> 08:12.639
I found it in an antiques shop in
London two months ago.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.760
Worthless, and yet something about
it spoke to me.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.600
St Michael the Archangel.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.440
The leader of angels - summoning men
from their lives on Earth

08:22.480 --> 08:24.080
to their heavenly judgment.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.880
Are you saying you want redemption?

08:27.920 --> 08:31.399
I'm saying, if I'm found guilty
I will surely hang.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.479
If that comes to pass,
I want you to hear my confession,

08:36.480 --> 08:39.679
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help me God.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.520
Will you do it, Father?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.360
Of course.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.240
Thank you.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.560
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.799
Flambeau.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.399
Lenny.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.720
So you remember me. I'm touched.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.279
Well, I never forget a pretty face.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.040
You ought to watch yourself talking
like that around here,

09:27.080 --> 09:29.080
some blokes might get the
wrong idea.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.159
But then again,
maybe that's what you like.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.160
As much as I'm enjoying this
flirtation,

09:35.200 --> 09:36.840
I have business to discuss.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.839
I'm in here cos of you.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.319
You sounded the alarm.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.080
You sounded the alarm!

09:43.120 --> 09:45.479
You ran off with the loot and left
me to get caught.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.999
Paranoid fantasies.
That always was your problem.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.200
Oi! Keep your hands off him.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.280
This ain't over.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.120
Go on.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.000
Thank you for your intervention.

10:06.040 --> 10:10.040
Well, it's not their job to snuff
you out. It's ours.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.280
You look like a man who can get
things. For a price.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.440
So, you're what?

10:33.480 --> 10:38.520
Giving spiritual guidance...
to the killer of my husband?

10:38.560 --> 10:41.200
I understand you may not think
he deserves it...

10:41.240 --> 10:42.800
He deserves Hell.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.400
Perhaps he does.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.760
I am not just there for him.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.360
I'm here for you.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.240
And we've brought you some
Bakewell tarts.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.000
Mrs McCarthy, parish secretary.
And...

11:03.040 --> 11:06.360
Bunty Windermere.
I'm the parish grief counsellor.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.240
How are you coping?

11:09.640 --> 11:12.040
It's not been easy, obviously.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.080
We were married for 18 years.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.000
It must have been terrible
witnessing what you did.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.280
It was.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.719
If you don't mind my asking,

11:27.720 --> 11:31.760
what were Flambeau and your
husband arguing about?

11:31.800 --> 11:34.600
Money. What else?

11:35.880 --> 11:37.440
But I didn't hear all of it.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.759
I was up in the bedroom,
getting ready for bed.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.959
So, you didn't see the murder?

11:42.960 --> 11:45.160
Well, no, but...

11:46.800 --> 11:49.280
Why are you asking all these
questions?

11:51.520 --> 11:55.759
Well, I've heard Flambeau's
side of the story

11:55.760 --> 11:57.640
and I'd like to hear yours.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.840
I was about to come in here and tell
them to shut their mouths...

12:05.920 --> 12:07.880
..then it all went quiet.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.720
I looked out of the window.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.120
Saw that monster dragging my
husband into the woods.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.240
That must have been awful.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.959
I followed him, to the river,

12:17.960 --> 12:20.120
saw him throw his body in like
a ragdoll.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.000
Oh, that's just from the last night
I spent with Flynn.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.839
I've not been able to bring myself
to clear them away.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.960
Now, if you don't mind,
I think I'd rather be alone.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.840
Of course. So sorry for your loss.
God bless.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.360
I'm telling you, that
woman was lying through her teeth.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
And right to our faces.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.399
She's having an affair.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.439
That could be it. Deceiving her
husband before he was killed.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.320
So, maybe she did it.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.759
Or her lover did.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.560
Her lover. Wait a minute!

13:05.720 --> 13:09.679
Wait a minute, supposing her husband
isn't dead at all, he's still alive

13:09.680 --> 13:12.520
and they're both in on it
together to stitch up Flambeau.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.000
But why would they do that?

13:14.040 --> 13:15.920
Well he probably
double-crossed them,

13:15.960 --> 13:17.920
just like he double-crosses
everyone.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.000
So, the wine and the candles...

13:20.040 --> 13:23.719
Yes, a husband and wife having
a romantic night together,

13:23.720 --> 13:26.759
and no doubt celebrating
Flambeau's arrest.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.560
Romantic nights after 18 years
of marriage? I don't think so.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.600
Ah, yes, but then you are a cynic.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.040
I'm a realist.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.519
Well, either way,

13:34.520 --> 13:38.120
we need to find out if there's
someone else in that house with her.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.560
A stakeout,
like they do at the pictures.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.520
Exactly! Father?

13:46.240 --> 13:49.319
I am going to Flambeau's
pre-trial hearing,

13:49.320 --> 13:52.480
and I leave the surveillance in
your capable hands.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.680
Order. Order.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.959
Hercule Flambeau,

14:09.960 --> 14:15.839
you are charged on indictment that
on August 17th, 1953,

14:15.840 --> 14:18.720
you did wilfully murder
Flynn Hardwick in

14:18.760 --> 14:20.720
the county of Gloucestershire.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.240
How do you plead?

14:27.280 --> 14:29.040
Guilty.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.560
Order! Order!

14:40.480 --> 14:42.440
Thank you.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.399
Why the change of heart?

14:46.400 --> 14:48.800
I've finally accepted my need
for salvation.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.040
I'd like to believe you...

14:52.080 --> 14:54.319
But?

14:54.320 --> 14:57.400
I've seen you wear too many
disguises.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.160
I just confessed to murder.
There's no disguising that.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.040
And yet you seem remarkably...

15:03.240 --> 15:05.399
..unperturbed for a man facing the
death sentence.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.719
Is it really that difficult for you
to believe that I might be at
peace, Father?

15:08.720 --> 15:11.559
That unburdening myself
has finally released me?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.800
I thought that was what you've
always wanted?

15:15.840 --> 15:17.640
Court's in session.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.600
Hercule Flambeau,

15:27.640 --> 15:29.479
in accordance with the law

15:29.480 --> 15:33.440
and the requirements
of just punishment and retribution,

15:33.480 --> 15:37.079
I sentence you to be taken
from this place

15:37.080 --> 15:40.559
and hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.240
Order! Order!

15:44.800 --> 15:48.120
In the interest of mitigating any
further glorification of your

15:48.160 --> 15:52.639
vile criminal history
by the gutter press,

15:52.640 --> 15:55.439
I order that execution be carried
out at

15:55.440 --> 15:58.319
the earliest possible convenience.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.720
Take him down.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.480
Why are you doing this?

16:05.520 --> 16:09.040
I already told you, I'm answering
the call of heavenly judgment.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.360
She's washing the dishes.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.200
I can see that from here.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.039
It's the wine glasses.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.840
She's getting rid of the evidence!

16:25.080 --> 16:27.920
Can you see if anyone else is in
the room with her?

16:27.960 --> 16:29.559
No.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.640
Wait. Look.
Someone's opening the window!

16:34.080 --> 16:35.800
There!

16:35.840 --> 16:37.640
Can you see his face?

16:37.680 --> 16:41.599
No, her big, fat head is in the way.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.760
Oh! We need a closer look.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.519
All you had to do was clear away
those glasses.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.520
I was going to.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.920
Yeah, it's always "I was going to,"
with you, isn't it?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.559
As if some wine and a few candles

16:58.560 --> 17:00.359
would make up for what you did,
anyway.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.319
How long are you going to keep
punishing me for that?

17:02.320 --> 17:04.280
I told you, it didn't mean anything.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.118
Well, that's what all men say.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.559
Besides, I'm making it up to you,
aren't I?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.160
Look at the risk I'm taking...

17:10.200 --> 17:13.200
Ow! Ow! My sciatica!

17:13.240 --> 17:15.159
What was that?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.440
Oi! Run!

17:30.120 --> 17:31.880
Get in! Get in!

17:34.200 --> 17:36.960
Oi! You! Come back here!

17:43.200 --> 17:46.720
Father? In here.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.360
I was right!
Flambeau didn't kill Flynn Hardwick.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.400
He's still alive. Exactly!

17:51.440 --> 17:52.600
We just saw him at the house.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.879
Looks like they've stitched up
Flambeau together,

17:54.880 --> 17:56.839
just like Mrs M said. Not quite.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.719
What does that mean?

17:58.720 --> 18:01.960
Flambeau isn't the victim in all
this.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.400
He's the architect.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.400
Clean sheets.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.600
I know why you're here.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.160
Enlighten me.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.800
The Medallion of the Archangel.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.320
Unlike your replica,
the original was made of gold.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.400
Last known owner, Nathaniel Grey,

19:09.440 --> 19:13.279
collector of religious antiquities.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.280
A man after my own heart.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.320
And according to the plaque
outside the gates...

19:22.320 --> 19:25.640
..the architect of this prison.
Go on.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.359
On his death, his collection was
donated to

19:31.360 --> 19:34.599
the Roman Capitoline museums -

19:34.600 --> 19:38.040
apart from one artefact that was
not accounted for.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.319
And I think you know where it is.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.880
My guess would be the condemned
cell.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.200
Which is why you faked
Flynn Hardwick's death.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.480
Bravo, Father.
I'd knew you'd catch up eventually.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.399
How did you know where it was?

19:58.400 --> 20:01.160
I acquired Nathaniel Grey's
private papers at auction.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.199
He was a pious imbecile.

20:03.200 --> 20:07.039
He actually believed the medallion
had the power to combat Satan

20:07.040 --> 20:09.599
and escort the faithful to Heaven.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.720
And no better place to work its
wonder...

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
..than the condemned cell.
Precisely.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.320
How do you intend to get it out?

20:24.360 --> 20:25.999
As always, Father,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.400
with a combination of ingenuity
and panache.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.080
You are facing the gallows...

20:37.160 --> 20:38.760
..for a piece of gold?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.679
I assure you, Father...

20:42.680 --> 20:45.440
I have no intention of standing on
the gallows.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.320
Out!

21:04.040 --> 21:06.479
From now on you'll be on
death watch.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.040
Two officers will be with
you at all times,

21:09.080 --> 21:12.280
to stop you from doing yourself in
before the main event.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.760
Thank you, that's very kind.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.479
But first,
I'd like to take confession,

21:18.480 --> 21:21.359
with your permission, of course.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.800
Five minutes.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.120
The medallion's in the wall.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.799
And I have five minutes to find it.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.720
This was never about confession!

21:43.800 --> 21:46.800
You just wanted to get rid of the
death watch officers.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.040
And what better way than the
sanctity of confession.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.680
You've used me from the start.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.520
Don't be disgruntled, Father. You're
enjoying this as much as I am.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.760
Now the question is - which brick?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.039
You don't know, do you?

22:00.040 --> 22:02.280
Nathaniel Grey didn't specify,

22:02.320 --> 22:04.519
but I don't believe he would have
hidden the medallion

22:04.520 --> 22:06.960
without leaving some sort of clue as
to...

22:11.640 --> 22:13.840
"Mark, 16:16."

22:13.880 --> 22:17.519
"He that believeth and is baptised,
shall be saved;

22:17.520 --> 22:22.199
"but he that believeth not
shall be condemned."

22:22.200 --> 22:23.680
Shall we?

22:28.080 --> 22:33.040
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten,

22:33.080 --> 22:36.560
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.080
Et voila!

22:46.560 --> 22:47.919
Alive?

22:47.920 --> 22:50.159
We saw him with our own eyes.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.999
How good is your eyesight?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.039
Mine's 20/20, and I saw him too.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.880
But Flambeau confessed.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.960
He's lying! He's trying to steal
some kind of medallion.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.360
Solid gold.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.160
And how do you know this?

23:02.200 --> 23:03.479
Father Brown!

23:03.480 --> 23:06.519
The padre. Of course
he's involved in all of this.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.320
I'm not listening to another word.
Inspector...

23:13.600 --> 23:16.279
I think you have about two minutes.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.640
More than enough time.

23:18.680 --> 23:19.840
What?

23:19.880 --> 23:22.760
To remove a 160 year old brick?

23:22.800 --> 23:27.119
Amongst Nathaniel Grey's papers,
I found plans for a device.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.639
What sort of device?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.919
This sort of device.

23:38.520 --> 23:42.280
Yes? What was that noise?

23:42.320 --> 23:44.800
Noise? One minute.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.480
It's beautiful.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.759
How are you going to get
it out of here?

24:16.760 --> 24:18.560
That's the easy part.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.040
I'm going to stroll outside the
front door.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.159
So, Flynn Hardwick will
turn himself in?

24:25.160 --> 24:27.920
Tomorrow morning, alive and well.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.399
Time's up.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.880
Thank you, Father.
Your assistance has been invaluable.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.960
God bless.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.280
I'm going to watch him for a minute.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.880
I'm not supposed to be telling you
this,

25:04.920 --> 25:06.720
but I thought you should know...

25:08.360 --> 25:14.040
..they've rescheduled your
execution for tomorrow at 10am.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.439
So, in about... 17 hours,

25:17.440 --> 25:22.760
you'll be twisting and writhing at
the end of a rope,

25:22.800 --> 25:24.800
fouling yourself most likely.

25:27.760 --> 25:32.520
Anyway, like I said,
I thought you had a right to know.

25:41.480 --> 25:46.120
"I'm so sorry, Your Honour,
the booze took hold of me again.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.000
"I didn't know where I was,
or even who I was.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.600
"My friend, Hercule Flambeau,

25:52.640 --> 25:55.920
"has been accused of a heinous crime
that never even happened."

25:55.960 --> 25:58.680
All right, all right. You're not
auditioning for Hamlet, you know.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.559
I need to make it seem natural.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.200
Then don't over-rehearse it.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.440
Once I get paid,
this'll be a fresh start for us.

26:07.480 --> 26:12.400
We can go anywhere, be happy
together for the rest of our lives,
can't we?

26:13.960 --> 26:16.880
I love you, Peg.
I even shed blood for you.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.759
You didn't do it for me,
you did it for him.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.600
I did it for us.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.879
You're an old romantic, really,
aren't you?

26:24.880 --> 26:26.359
Always have been.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.560
That's how I made you fall
in love with me.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.600
Go on, you've got to come back
from the dead, remember.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.280
Oh, love?

26:53.760 --> 26:57.000
You've got a visitor. Get a move on.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.560
What are you doing here?

27:21.600 --> 27:25.440
The grieving wife has a right to see
her husband's killer
before his execution.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.119
At least that's what I told the
guards. Shed a few tears.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.520
It was quite the performance,
even if I do say so myself...

27:31.560 --> 27:33.360
Where's Flynn?

27:33.400 --> 27:36.600
He's tied up... literally.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.640
And if you want me to let him go,

27:39.680 --> 27:42.080
you give me what you're wearing
round your neck.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.360
That's it, isn't it?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.480
You killed him.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.440
Of course I didn't kill him.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.080
Yes, all right, I did.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.360
Every marriage goes through its
difficulties.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.839
If you give me that medallion,

28:03.840 --> 28:06.040
I'll give the police a tip-off,

28:06.080 --> 28:07.840
tell them where the body is.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.920
They'll see he only died recently,
and know you couldn't have done it.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.999
At which point,
you become a suspect.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.279
Once I have the gold,
I can go anywhere I want.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.679
Even if I agreed, there isn't time.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.120
I'm to be hanged this morning.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.480
Then there's no time to lose.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.920
And let you walk away
and watch me die?

28:25.400 --> 28:28.000
What choice have you got
but to trust me?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.640
I have one choice
and one choice only -

28:30.680 --> 28:34.519
to extricate myself from this
facility and hunt you down.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.680
You'll never get out of here.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.600
You have no idea what I'm capable
of.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.840
You're already a dead man.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.640
I need to see my priest!

28:56.880 --> 28:58.680
You wait in the car.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.680
I am not waiting in the car!

29:00.720 --> 29:03.160
What if we have to run again?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.400
I managed perfectly well the last
time.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.399
Shh!

29:16.400 --> 29:17.760
What's that sound?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.840
It's coming from behind the house.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.640
Run! Run!

29:49.680 --> 29:51.080
Come on!

29:54.160 --> 29:57.600
Not this time, ladies.

29:57.640 --> 30:01.679
Murdered?
A most unfortunate turn of events.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.280
If the police find the body...

30:03.320 --> 30:05.519
There isn't time.
I'm to be executed in half an hour.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.120
Half an hour?!

30:07.160 --> 30:09.319
Fortunately, I wouldn't have
embarked on this endeavour

30:09.320 --> 30:12.920
if I didn't have a backup plan,
but I'll need your help. To escape?

30:12.960 --> 30:14.840
I need something to unlock
a pair of handcuffs.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.480
A key would be ideal...
Or a lock pick?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.920
If you have one handy.

30:19.960 --> 30:24.560
Telephone call for you,
Father Brown. Officer's station.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.440
Wait for me outside.

30:31.360 --> 30:42.080
Tick-tock.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.960
Hello?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.160
Father Brown? Yes.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.000
'This is Peggy Hardwick.'

30:51.440 --> 30:54.440
I'm pointing
a shotgun at your two friends

30:54.480 --> 30:57.839
Bunty Windermere
and Bridget McCarthy.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.999
Do you understand?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.360
Yes.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.239
'If you want to ever see them alive
again, '

31:03.240 --> 31:04.600
I suggest you do as I say.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.680
Get me that medallion.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.879
I suggest stealing it from
Flambeau's body once he's been
hanged.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.680
I want to speak to them.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.159
Bring it to my house.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.000
We'll be waiting.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.480
If I can't speak to them,
I will do nothing.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.560
Father?

31:27.600 --> 31:29.200
'Bunty?'

31:29.240 --> 31:31.616
She's mad. She killed her husband
and buried him in the garden.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.360
Don't listen to anything she... No!

31:37.760 --> 31:39.840
If you don't do what I say,

31:39.880 --> 31:43.440
they'll both be getting a lot more
than a little bump on the head.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.399
He insisted on seeing you, sir.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.560
Make sure the hatches are down.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.720
I don't want the same ruckus on
Flambeau's exit

32:09.760 --> 32:12.440
that we had on his arrival.
Yes, sir.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.880
Yes, Father, what can I do for you?

32:13.920 --> 32:15.959
I am rather pressed for time.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.599
Flambeau is innocent.
Excuse me?

32:18.600 --> 32:22.159
He didn't kill Flynn Hardwick.
His wife did.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.639
And you know this how?

32:23.640 --> 32:26.280
Well, if you send the police to
his house,

32:26.320 --> 32:28.720
you'll find his body buried
in the garden.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.919
Look, even if what you say were
true,

32:32.920 --> 32:35.160
there is nothing that I can do.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.600
You could postpone his execution.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.480
Out of my jurisdiction.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.520
Well, then, telephone a judge.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.360
On the words of a priest?

32:47.200 --> 32:51.280
You are about to execute
an innocent man.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.680
The sentence has been passed.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.200
You may perform the last rites,

33:01.240 --> 33:03.840
but if I hear one more word of
this nonsense,

33:03.880 --> 33:06.680
I shall have one of my officers
throw you out.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.320
I understand.

33:28.760 --> 33:29.760
It's time.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.680
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.800
You're a homosexual, aren't you?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.520
What?

34:13.040 --> 34:15.360
What did you say to me?

34:15.400 --> 34:18.800
As a condemned man, I believe I have
the right to speak the truth.

34:18.840 --> 34:22.279
I saw the way you looked at
me when I was undressing.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.679
And I saw the way you looked at
me just now.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.400
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.239
Does your wife know?

34:38.400 --> 34:41.279
Come any closer and I'll perforate
his jugular.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.399
Give him the keys.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.960
Now! Go!

34:47.600 --> 34:48.840
Let's go.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.918
Stop!

34:56.159 --> 34:58.000
Quickly, quickly!

35:00.680 --> 35:02.680
Turn right! Down the stairs!

35:06.360 --> 35:08.960
Oi!
Up.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.600
Lockdown!

35:13.320 --> 35:15.079
Back to your cells!

35:15.080 --> 35:17.320
Go, go!

35:17.360 --> 35:19.759
All the way to the end.
Find the key.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.360
Open that door.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.559
I wouldn't come any closer!

35:25.560 --> 35:27.440
Stand back!

35:27.480 --> 35:30.720
Come any closer and I'll kill him!

35:30.760 --> 35:32.280
Take out your keys.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.600
Take out your keys!

35:38.640 --> 35:40.400
Do as he says.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.360
Quickly.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.080
Now throw them over the edge

35:48.200 --> 35:49.480
Now.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.840
Go!

36:08.720 --> 36:10.080
That was convincing.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.840
Don't worry. I would only have
killed you as a last resort.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.600
So, how do you intend to get out?

36:15.640 --> 36:17.040
Voila!

36:30.280 --> 36:32.040
What is this place?

36:32.080 --> 36:33.760
In less enlightened times,

36:33.800 --> 36:36.320
prisoners were chained around this
cesspool for days.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.760
Needless to say, they weren't
permitted a lavatory break.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.960
This is where I leave you, Father.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.720
Um, no.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.919
I'm coming with you.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.879
No, no. You'll only slow me down.
We haven't time.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.800
You have no choice.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.560
What? You think you can just
walk away from me?

37:00.320 --> 37:03.400
You can kill me, if you want to...
Oi!

37:03.440 --> 37:05.360
That's what I'm going to do.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.480
..or you can join me in escaping.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.200
I'll show you the way.
Yeah, you will.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.080
You too.
No, no. We don't need him.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.600
I say we do. You can never have
too many hostages.

37:36.280 --> 37:40.320
Whoo!

37:40.360 --> 37:42.520
Keep your voice down, you imbecile.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.560
You forget I still got this?

37:47.960 --> 37:49.640
And this?

37:51.120 --> 37:52.920
It appears to have lost its sheen.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.199
You think you're clever, priest?

37:59.200 --> 38:01.120
Hm?

38:03.520 --> 38:05.080
Well played, Father.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.160
You switched them in the tunnel.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.200
Glad to be of assistance.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.640
The medallion?

38:14.680 --> 38:17.239
I'm afraid I can't.

38:17.240 --> 38:18.880
I beg to differ.

38:21.760 --> 38:25.679
Peggy Hardwick is holding two of my
dearest friends hostage.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.400
If I don't give her the medallion,

38:27.440 --> 38:29.880
she's threatening to kill them
and...

38:31.200 --> 38:32.600
..I believe her.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.080
Where is she?

38:46.160 --> 38:49.160
He's here. The door's open!

38:55.000 --> 38:58.160
Don't worry,
this'll all be over soon enough.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.640
Are you all right?

39:07.680 --> 39:08.800
What happened to you?

39:09.960 --> 39:13.679
Long story. Enough chit-chat.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.800
Give it to me.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.000
Good.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.720
Right, into the back garden.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.880
Oh, no, you don't!

39:34.480 --> 39:36.760
The medallion. Now.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.840
No.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.600
Please, don't.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.920
Flambeau, you are not a murderer.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.320
But she is.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.560
Doesn't she deserve the death
penalty?

39:55.840 --> 40:01.280
No-one has the right to take
a life, least of all you.

40:01.320 --> 40:03.920
As much as I'd love to debate the
ethics of capital punishment

40:03.960 --> 40:06.120
with you, Father,
it appears I have to run.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.880
Do you know how to handle this?

40:08.920 --> 40:11.520
What do you think?
My kind of woman.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.040
Au revoir, Father.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.760
God be with you.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.600
What's going on?

40:24.640 --> 40:25.760
She tried to kill us!

40:25.800 --> 40:27.280
And she killed her husband!

40:27.320 --> 40:29.200
You'll find his grave out
in the garden.

40:29.240 --> 40:30.680
None of which would have happened

40:30.720 --> 40:32.799
if you'd listened to us in
the first place!

40:32.800 --> 40:34.760
I'll take that, thank you.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.920
We had a report Flambeau
was in the area.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.520
He's gone. Where?

40:42.560 --> 40:43.959
That way.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.640
Goodfellow.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.800
Right, lads,
take her down the station.

40:47.840 --> 40:51.599
No. No, I'm not going with you.
Get off me!

40:51.600 --> 40:53.760
I said, get off me!

40:53.800 --> 40:55.520
What is that awful smell?

40:57.560 --> 40:59.120
It's me.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.520
Stand still!

41:11.480 --> 41:13.160
Don't shoot him!

41:18.080 --> 41:19.560
Stop!

42:13.360 --> 42:16.560
"Father, please accept the enclosed
as a token of thanks

42:16.600 --> 42:19.759
"for your assistance in our latest
adventure.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.840
"It's damaged goods to me now,

42:21.880 --> 42:24.000
"but I trust you'll put it to
charitable use."

42:56.640 --> 42:58.400
Merci dieu.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.840
Oi, you! Come back here!
