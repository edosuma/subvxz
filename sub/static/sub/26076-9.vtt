00:14.014 --> 00:16.016
-[indistinct chatter]
-[traffic bustling]

00:22.981 --> 00:24.399
[train rumbling in distance]

00:28.778 --> 00:31.781
-[Colleen] Danny, where are we going?
-[Danny] I need to show you.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.327
I was chasing a mugger down East Broadway.
I lost him when he came down here.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.247
I figured he dodged
into a maintenance doorway.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.841
I told myself it was a place to train...

00:51.426 --> 00:52.510
hone my skills.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.930
But in the end,
it became much more than that.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.392
So you, what?

01:00.101 --> 01:02.979
Dragged all this stuff in here
and punched the hell out of it?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.606
I was out almost every night.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.401
I told myself I was watching
over the neighborhood.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.904
For the most part, that was true, but...

01:11.613 --> 01:14.824
deep down, all I really wanted
was to use the Fist.

01:15.408 --> 01:19.370
It would give me a sense of clarity,
a release...

01:20.872 --> 01:21.790
power.

01:21.873 --> 01:25.168
When I couldn't find an excuse to use it
on the streets, I'd come here.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.005
I'd stay for hours and hours.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.884
Until I didn't know where I ended
and it began.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.512
I knew there was something.

01:36.888 --> 01:41.017
You'd be gone so long,
no activity on the crime scanner.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.230
I didn't know where you were,
but I wondered.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.397
Why didn't you say anything?

01:47.065 --> 01:49.234
Maybe I didn't want to face the truth.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.194
But I tried.

01:51.778 --> 01:56.074
I told you that I thought you needed
to slow down, more times than I can count.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.409
You're right. I didn't listen.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.455
But this is the reason
why I need to step away.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.749
You're overreacting, Danny.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.377
You made mistakes.
You can learn from them.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.586
And I intend to.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.339
But I can't do that
if I'm holding the Fist.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.036
-The answer is no.
-Colleen...

02:44.497 --> 02:46.249
I know you didn't ask for this.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.419
And the heart of the dragon
is a huge responsibility.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.129
But I didn't ask for it, either.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.756
And, honestly,
this has nothing to do with me.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.008
It isn't a burden.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.847
In K'un-Lun, the Iron Fist was
the greatest honor that could be achieved.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.640
We're not in K'un-Lun.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.394
We're standing in the subway
under Eldridge Street. [chuckles]

03:09.022 --> 03:12.317
Danny, you trained for years.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.320
You fought your friends.
You fought a freaking mythical beast.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.448
You had problems controlling it,
but who wouldn't?

03:18.531 --> 03:22.535
You can't just pawn it off on me
because you don't want it anymore.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.287
You're not listening to me.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.915
I do want it.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.294
I want it back more than anything.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.591
But I know who I become
when it's a part of me.

03:36.674 --> 03:42.472
Then I will help you. I'll support you.
I'll train you. I'll do whatever it takes.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.766
But at the end of this,

03:45.433 --> 03:49.229
when we beat Davos,
you have to take the power from him.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.607
Colleen... please, just consider it.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.276
There's nothing to consider.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.280
You are the Iron Fist.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.327
Let's go home.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.214
[cell phone vibrating]

04:21.219 --> 04:22.553
What do you want, man?

04:22.637 --> 04:23.972
[Crank] <i>You really screwed us.</i>

04:24.055 --> 04:27.392
Davos is putting it on his lady right now,
but you know it's gonna blow back on us.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.476
Just leave.

04:29.018 --> 04:32.689
<i>I want to. So does Squad. But where to?</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:34.649
<i>It ain't like any of us</i>
<i>have a home to go to.</i>

04:35.692 --> 04:37.151
What does Ryhno say about it?

04:37.235 --> 04:40.446
<i>I didn't wanna tell you,</i>
<i>'cause I know you two are buds.</i>

04:40.530 --> 04:42.240
<i>Shit went south at Yip's.</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:44.117
He's dead, BB.

04:46.035 --> 04:50.248
[stammers] Nah, that... that's messed up.
How'd that even happen?

04:50.331 --> 04:53.751
Davos got pissed.
Same way he is right now.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.169
It all went to shit.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.215
Okay, look. I'm somewhere safe.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.176
There are people here
who want to take Davos down.

05:02.760 --> 05:03.678
Hard.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.308
Be honest with me.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.269
[sighs]

05:11.352 --> 05:13.187
I've done nothing wrong.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.650
He's gone.
No sign he broke out of that room.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.986
Someone must have let him out.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.655
[scoffs]

05:25.825 --> 05:27.577
You were the only one here, Joy.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.747
So where did he take the bowl?

05:31.789 --> 05:34.375
I can't believe
we're even having this conversation.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.295
I am the one that bought you the bowl.

05:38.212 --> 05:42.258
You think that I teamed up with a child
to steal it from you? I mean...

05:43.676 --> 05:46.387
I have the power to crush you
with my bare hands, Joy.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.306
To end you.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.476
If you don't tell me the truth, I swear...

05:52.352 --> 05:56.189
I swear I'll take my time until this floor
is slick with disloyal blood.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.361
You wanna know where he is? I sent him to the FBI.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.201
He's telling them where to find the killer

06:08.284 --> 06:11.371
who's been murdering his way
up and down Mulberry Street.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.497
Now, if you hurry...

06:13.373 --> 06:15.750
you might just make it out
before they get here.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.835
Wait.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.839
What is that? Are those sirens?

06:21.923 --> 06:23.091
We should cut and run.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.968
Fill up gas cans, light a match,
torch this place up.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.053
We're not leaving.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.764
You might not have heard
of the federal law enforcement--

06:29.847 --> 06:31.516
I know what the FBI is.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.103
She's lying.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.481
She means to help Danny
take the Fist from me.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.149
He put you up to this.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.611
He can't bear the weight of his failure.

06:43.694 --> 06:47.073
-Danny doesn't even know I'm here.
-Don't debase yourself with more lies.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.076
No one knows that I'm here, Davos.
I came of my own volition.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.244
And why would you do that?

06:51.327 --> 06:54.580
Because you're out of your mind
and someone has to stop you.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.208
Denigrate Danny all you want...

06:58.709 --> 07:00.294
you stole the Fist from him.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.254
You stole it.

07:01.337 --> 07:04.924
Which means you're no better
than the criminals you claim to despise.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.803
It makes sense that you hang out
with a bunch of teenagers,

07:08.886 --> 07:12.890
because any adult,
one-eyed sycophants excluded,

07:13.474 --> 07:15.977
would instantly see
how full of shit you are.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.730
Wordplay and sarcasm are your shield, Joy.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.276
But it can't hide the fear
beneath that flimsy armor.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.237
[Crank] Shifu.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.992
BB's at Bayard Community.
I just spoke to him.

07:31.617 --> 07:36.205
Then we'll go and retrieve him...
and bring back what he stole from me.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.709
We could, but there's a whole crew
of Hatchets and Tigers there.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.044
Sounds like they're settin' up
to take a run at you.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.130
Call it serendipity.

07:45.006 --> 07:49.177
It seems your friend has inadvertently
shown us where our enemies congregate.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.263
I'll have to thank him
before I separate his head from his neck.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.431
[neck cracks]

07:55.850 --> 07:56.934
What about her?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.449
You have a failure of vision, Joy.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.330
You know, it's not your fault,
it's how you were raised.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.210
Maybe it was too much to hope
that you'd chosen a path of righteousness.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.253
Davos...

08:26.255 --> 08:28.382
you have no one.

08:29.759 --> 08:34.138
Your family is gone.
You brutalized your best friend.

08:34.931 --> 08:40.269
You live in squalor.
I am the only one left who knows you.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.440
So before you do something
that you are gonna regret,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.484
just ask yourself...

08:47.777 --> 08:48.611
[sighs]

08:50.279 --> 08:52.031
...is this really what you want?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.578
I've never had greater clarity.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.171
[theme music playing]

10:57.448 --> 10:58.491
[knocking at door]

11:02.995 --> 11:04.080
-Hey.
-[Misty] Hey.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.582
-What time is it?
-Oh, it's late.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.295
I was wrapped up in red tape downtown.
Got here as soon as I could.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.798
-Is Colleen around?
-Tell me you have good news.

11:13.881 --> 11:18.052
Oh, I got a lot of it.
First of all, I got us a task force.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.136
[chuckles]

11:20.054 --> 11:21.555
You got Pike to play ball?

11:21.639 --> 11:25.267
Oh, I went over Pike's head
to Deputy Chief Ridley.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.020
Apparently,
"pattern of discriminatory negligence"

11:28.104 --> 11:30.481
is a scary phrase
when you got your eye on City Hall.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.774
Wow.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.777
That's great news. So, what now?

11:34.860 --> 11:39.532
I put in a rush request for a no-knock.
Should have that in hand by the morning.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.534
ESU. We go in hard and fast.

11:41.617 --> 11:45.496
Get Davos, get the bowl,
get your fancy little Fist back.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.500
-Right. We should talk about that.
-You said there was more?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.295
Yeah, I figured
while I was pissing off NYPD,

11:53.379 --> 11:55.631
I might as well hit up the US Marshals.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.135
I got someone downstairs that you
might be interested in talking to.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.514
Furniture store owner
by the name of Frank Choi.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.307
[Danny] Frank Choi is downstairs?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.059
[Misty] Yeah. You were right.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.438
Turns out he cut a deal
to inform on the Golden Tigers.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.315
I convinced the feds
to let you ask a few questions

12:13.399 --> 12:14.984
before he heads off to wit pro.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.780
-Hey, look, it's now or never.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.199
I sat on that
for I don't even know how long.

12:23.117 --> 12:23.951
[sighs]

12:24.034 --> 12:26.120
And now you're saying
it's worth something.

12:26.203 --> 12:29.039
I don't know that.
I just want to ask you some questions.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.253
Answer her questions.

12:37.339 --> 12:42.678
Found this in your shop.
It's a record of life debt payment plans.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.347
The Golden Tigers had a pipeline.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.559
They'd bring people over,
I sold 'em papers.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.896
These characters are all flowers.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.607
My guess,
it's some sort of replacement code.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.649
[scoffs] Good guess.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.027
Give me the key.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.532
Who gave you the box?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.117
[Frank] I don't ask for names.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.829
And I wouldn't recognize her
if she was standing in front of me.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.582
But I'll never forget her bullshit.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.834
What's that mean?

13:13.918 --> 13:17.421
I do good work. It's not cheap.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.133
Sometimes, I let them pay me
with property, you know?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.427
Jewelry, mostly. Art.

13:24.178 --> 13:28.098
This lady brings a box,
says it's worth a fortune.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.560
It's just a brush and comb set.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.896
[Frank] I was skeptical, too. Believe me.

13:33.979 --> 13:39.360
She spun this whole yarn about a princess
and this fisherman she falls in love with.

13:39.902 --> 13:45.449
He's in hot water with a pirate king,
whatever that is, and is marked for death.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.701
She goes to save him.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.746
The princess ends up
taking down the pirate

13:50.830 --> 13:52.540
and takes over his ship.

13:53.123 --> 13:57.211
[scoffs] And that was supposed to be made
from the bow sprint.

13:57.294 --> 14:02.633
Legendary. Priceless.
A bunch of grade-A crap on a stick.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.928
It's not crap, it's a... It's a story.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.973
"The Pirate Queen of Pinghai Bay."

14:09.056 --> 14:10.724
You've heard it before?

14:11.308 --> 14:12.601
Yeah, when I was a kid.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.188
It's a... It's a bedtime story.
[chuckles] My mother made it...

14:20.693 --> 14:22.778
No one else could've told you that story.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.865
That means your mother
was here in New York.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.202
Get him out of here.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.684
Where would your mom
hear a story like that?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.769
Like I said, she made it up.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.649
Yeah, but what if she didn't?

15:02.109 --> 15:04.904
I don't know, Danny. What if she didn't?

15:04.987 --> 15:09.116
Do you remember any details
about the princess? Like a name, a year?

15:09.199 --> 15:12.578
Does it look like I wanna talk
about some make-believe princess?

15:13.287 --> 15:15.164
If my mom was alive and here--

15:15.247 --> 15:16.332
Then we can find her.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.209
We have the ledger.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.545
We have the code.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.423
I mean, maybe the Golden Tigers
have some sort of record--

15:24.506 --> 15:26.425
I should have left this alone. [sighs]

15:27.384 --> 15:31.388
This is your family, Colleen.
I know how much that means.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.641
I need a second.

15:37.102 --> 15:37.937
[door closes]

15:38.437 --> 15:39.647
Everything all right?

15:40.397 --> 15:41.523
I don't think so.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.860
I made a mistake bringing Choi here.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.236
No, it's not that.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.281
I mean, it partly is, but...

15:51.033 --> 15:52.159
it's complicated.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.537
[inhales deeply]

15:56.205 --> 15:58.290
[stammers] I told her that...

16:00.292 --> 16:03.379
when we get the Fist back from Davos,
that she should hold it.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.843
But, Danny, that's your everything.

16:09.927 --> 16:10.928
It was.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.807
But you saw what it did to me.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.726
It consumed me.

16:21.522 --> 16:25.651
You said that she could hold it.
Is that even possible?

16:26.276 --> 16:28.862
If we conduct
the Ceremony of Transference,

16:29.738 --> 16:33.826
give her a Tebori tattoo
inked with Davos' blood,

16:34.451 --> 16:38.706
and a piece of this brand from my chest,
use it as a conduit, then...

16:38.789 --> 16:40.082
it should work.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.878
It's the same thing Davos did to me.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.717
I'm guessing she didn't respond positively
to all of this.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.554
No.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.894
[door opens]

17:02.479 --> 17:04.648
-[door closes]
-[footsteps approaching]

17:05.566 --> 17:08.444
-[siren wailing in distance]
-[Colleen sighs]

17:10.612 --> 17:12.614
I probably should have called first.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.704
-You were just trying to help. It's fine.
-Yeah, but still, I'm sorry.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.582
There was never going to be
a happy ending to this.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.125
[scoffs]

17:23.584 --> 17:25.753
I knew it the minute I found that box.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.632
So much of my life turned out to be a lie.
Why not her too, right?

17:32.509 --> 17:33.510
I don't even know you,

17:33.594 --> 17:36.805
and I think this is the closest thing
I have to a healthy relationship.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.724
Same here.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.311
[Colleen chuckles]

17:43.937 --> 17:45.314
You and Danny.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.941
And even that's just...

17:48.025 --> 17:49.610
Yeah, he told me.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.445
He's out of his mind.

17:51.528 --> 17:55.032
Maybe. Nobody is born a hero.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.910
And it's a difficult thing to become.

17:57.993 --> 17:58.952
[Colleen sighs]

17:59.036 --> 18:03.624
Because most people are too weak,
too stupid or too selfish.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.918
Usually all of the above. You're not.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.713
-Having power doesn't make you a hero.
-I never said it did.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.466
I like Danny,

18:12.549 --> 18:16.678
and if he gets the Fist back,
it'll be in good hands. Or...

18:16.762 --> 18:18.722
hand. Whatever.

18:20.724 --> 18:24.561
But if you had that thing,
you would use it right.

18:25.437 --> 18:29.191
And you'd kick some serious ass.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.196
Either way, you two need to work this out,

18:34.279 --> 18:37.908
because my team and I move on Davos
first thing tomorrow.

18:42.746 --> 18:43.580
[sighs]

18:48.502 --> 18:50.462
What you're looking for, it's in there?

18:50.546 --> 18:54.091
I had to cut a big check
to a shady super PAC to get it, so...

18:56.009 --> 18:59.012
-By all means, take your time.
-Did you read this?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.889
Figured it was none of my business.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.724
Smart move.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.280
-[echoes of men shouting]
-[man 1] You don't have to do this!

19:20.576 --> 19:21.994
[shouting stops]

19:24.204 --> 19:26.748
Well, that was very melodramatic.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.627
Like a $500 fine waiting to happen.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.504
-Can we go get Joy now?
-No.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.134
I know what I'm up against,
and I'm not getting close to him again.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.136
Let me make a call.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.306
I know a guy who can get us
the right ordnance.

19:54.776 --> 19:55.611
Ooh.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.282
[Ward] Keep your shoulders down.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.956
-You made me slice the hell out of that.
-I'd say it was lousy form.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.875
You don't know what you talking about.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.960
We're not here for pro tips.
Let's get on with it.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.671
You didn't say anything
about showing up with a smart-ass suit.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.756
I'm not wearing a suit.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.966
Doesn't change a thing.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.385
He's fronting my costs.
But if that's an issue for you,

20:20.469 --> 20:22.387
then we can leave you
to practice your long game.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.598
[sighs and chuckles]

20:30.562 --> 20:31.688
Oh-ho!

20:33.899 --> 20:36.360
Here we have an M4.

20:36.944 --> 20:37.945
A1.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.907
I know you're not the type
to really lay it down, so I figured--

20:41.990 --> 20:43.992
Having the option does not hurt.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.036
She clean?

20:46.119 --> 20:47.579
You'll be her first dance.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.623
Got any AP rounds?

20:49.706 --> 20:53.043
Come on, now.
You come to Turk for a reason, don't you?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.004
-Bing!
-[Walker chuckles]

20:57.089 --> 20:59.091
-How about you, Suit?
-[Walker] He's not interested.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.592
I am interested.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.970
[Walker] You brought me to do a job,
not take you on safari.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.513
I know how to handle a gun.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.515
Because you've been
on the firing range one time? [Ward] I think the technical term
is "patricide."

21:08.600 --> 21:11.561
Although, I'm not sure it applies
to the repeatedly undead.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.523
"Necrocide" is more like it.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.733
And your sister let me call you a pussy.

21:17.818 --> 21:22.197
Well, go to town, Daddy killer.

21:27.786 --> 21:28.829
That one.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.164
A classic.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.625
What kind of rounds you thinking?

21:34.626 --> 21:35.794
Good ones.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.216
Good ones it is.

21:42.509 --> 21:46.430
Let's call it... 3K even.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.556
Pay the man.

21:52.561 --> 21:57.274
Shoulders down, keep your knees bent,
think about sunsets.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.776
It'll do wonders.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.200
Huh.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.787
"Think about sunsets."

22:11.496 --> 22:12.331
[chuckles]

22:16.710 --> 22:17.544
[gasps] Oh!

22:23.425 --> 22:24.426
[groaning] [exclaiming in pain]

22:42.778 --> 22:43.612
[groaning]

23:00.462 --> 23:01.630
Come on.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.675
[Joy grunting]

23:10.889 --> 23:11.890
Get up.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.893
Glad the boss isn't a betting man.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.187
I'd have lost a bundle.

23:17.729 --> 23:21.274
I thought...
there's no way you'd still be kickin'.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.152
If you're not gonna help me,
then just do it already.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.614
Wish I could,
but the boss isn't done with you yet.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.242
He's gonna bring
your blond friend back here

23:30.325 --> 23:33.829
and either kill you in front of him
or him in front of you.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.414
I can't remember which.

23:35.497 --> 23:39.167
How much... to let me go?

23:41.336 --> 23:42.754
How much?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.715
There was a time
those would've been the magic words.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.426
[groaning]

23:52.639 --> 23:54.641
But I'm on a different path now.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.310
Money means nothing. It's a false prophet.

23:57.394 --> 23:58.437
You can't...

23:58.520 --> 23:59.521
[laughs]

24:02.190 --> 24:05.318
You can't have bought
into Davos's bullshit.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.236
[chuckles]

24:06.319 --> 24:10.490
No lie. At first, I was driving him
around to save my own ass.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.119
But the boss means what he says.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.080
He really wants to change things.

24:17.831 --> 24:22.794
And you think that you're
on the black side of his moral ledger?

24:23.420 --> 24:24.254
[scoffs]

24:25.714 --> 24:30.552
I am a much better person than you,
and look at me.

24:31.344 --> 24:32.512
[chuckles]

24:34.890 --> 24:36.016
I give you credit.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.226
Most people in your position,

24:39.269 --> 24:41.521
they'd be more the beg-for-your-life type.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.064
[chuckles]

24:47.235 --> 24:48.695
[whispers] The day is young.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.779
[chuckles]

25:07.839 --> 25:09.174
We came as quickly as we could.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.635
I told you letting Mrs. Yang lay low here
was a bad idea.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.636
She still here?

25:13.178 --> 25:15.263
I overheard her say
they're going to make a move today.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.058
-I said I was gonna call the police.
-We'll handle it.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.936
She's downstairs.
She's not gonna be happy I called you.

25:24.231 --> 25:27.108
-How many more men do we have?
-Ten Hatchets.

25:27.984 --> 25:31.321
Not our finest, but loyal.
Six, maybe seven Tigers.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.657
-I'd hoped for more.
-We don't need any more.

25:34.491 --> 25:37.077
Prepare your soldiers.
We move in two hours.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.747
That's not happening.
Get your stuff. Get outta here.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.124
-It's not your call.
-She's not alone in this.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.335
You understand the lines
you're crossing here, Ms. Wing?

25:45.418 --> 25:48.171
There are children upstairs, Mrs...
Sam, tell her.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.590
They...
It's the Spring Fair planning committee.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.968
Those families are safer with us here.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.179
You say you have a plan to deal
with the man who murdered my husband,

25:56.263 --> 25:58.974
but all I've seen is run-and-hide
as people die.

25:59.057 --> 26:03.103
Just yesterday, Henry Yip,
an innocent restaurant owner, was killed.

26:07.774 --> 26:11.444
Any minute now, an NYPD task force
is gonna knock on Davos's door.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.530
You go there,
you're not just fighting him.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.323
You're fighting a dozen well-armed police.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.742
What you've done here is amazing.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.537
Uniting Hatchets and Tigers
under one baton.

26:20.620 --> 26:21.621
Out of necessity.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.164
It's still an opportunity.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.499
If you attack Davos,

26:24.583 --> 26:26.918
it ends with you and your men
dead or arrested.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.045
Or you can take what you have here

26:29.129 --> 26:31.131
and do what no one else
has been able to do.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.174
End the fighting.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.052
I know you don't trust us.

26:37.178 --> 26:38.722
I let you down at the parley.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.057
It won't happen again.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.102
We simply can't let
this situation continue.

26:44.185 --> 26:48.648
Then let us end it. Not tomorrow,
not the next day, but tonight.

26:48.732 --> 26:53.069
This community doesn't need more martyrs,
it needs leaders.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.989
Hey, lady, nice speech.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.700
-I told him to stay out.
-BB, just give us a minute, will ya?

26:58.783 --> 27:00.702
[BB] Your friend said
you and Blondie needed this. I went by your spot,
but you weren't there.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.583
Is that what I think it is?

27:12.213 --> 27:13.381
How did you get this?

27:14.132 --> 27:16.718
-Dude had it stashed. We found it.
-What were you doing with Davos?

27:16.801 --> 27:20.055
He's been, like, I don't know,
teaching us karate and shit.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.139
Kung fu.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.101
-Teaching who, exactly?
-The whole squad.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.188
He came by the crib, said come hang
at his, that he'd give us food and shit.

27:28.271 --> 27:31.191
I told you guys to come here and get that,
and you told me to take a walk.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.651
Yeah, well, I'm here now, ain't I?

27:32.734 --> 27:34.611
You said a friend told you we wanted this?

27:34.694 --> 27:38.281
Yeah, this lady. Real uptown looking.
Looks like she has mad cash.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.159
Joy? Joy Meachum?

27:41.242 --> 27:43.328
Thought she was done with Davos.
What was she doing there?

27:43.411 --> 27:47.123
[sighs] Well, at first, I figured
they were, like, you know, banging,

27:47.207 --> 27:49.376
but then she asked me
to help her get this bowl out.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.713
Look, if he knows, that dude Davos
is gonna mess her up really bad.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.215
It's only a matter of time.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.342
-We need to get her out of there.
-Misty's on her way.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.551
[knocking at door]

27:58.635 --> 28:01.596
Guys, I think we've got a problem.
They showed up a few minutes ago.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.348
I called 911,
but I didn't know what to say.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.266
They're just standing there.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.227
[Colleen] BB, whose side
are your friends on?

28:10.647 --> 28:12.649
I think I maybe made a mistake.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.823
We gotta get everyone out of here.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.950
That's my crew outside.
Let me ask 'em what's up.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.285
-I doubt they're here to talk.
-Is there another exit?

28:24.369 --> 28:25.787
Downstairs, at the loading dock.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.707
Now they want us to run
from children with bike chains.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.626
-It's not them we're afraid of.
-Davos.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.712
If he knows we have the bowl,
he's coming in here.

28:33.795 --> 28:37.090
Let him. We have weapons. We have men.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.842
Any way you slice this, it's a bloodbath.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.636
-Not if we take him down first.
-[Danny] You've seen the bodies.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.763
You know what he can do
to trained soldiers.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.974
How do you think
those families are gonna fare? We're going to escort the civilians
out of the building.

28:49.769 --> 28:52.480
This isn't their battle.
They shouldn't be touched by it.

28:53.022 --> 28:54.941
I'm taking a chance trusting you.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.571
My friends, please,
can I have your attention?

28:59.654 --> 29:02.031
Nothing to worry about,
but please gather around.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.908
We're going to evacuate the building.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.953
If I can cut through their line, maybe
I can lead them away from Bayard.

29:07.036 --> 29:10.290
No. This is what we've been training for.
We need to take a stand.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.834
We have the bowl.
All we gotta do is grab Davos.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.671
We need a sedative to knock him out. Shit.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.007
You said sedative. What kind?

29:19.716 --> 29:21.926
When we do soup kitchen,
we have a no drug policy.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.971
A lot of our homeless community uses,
so there's always confiscations.

29:25.054 --> 29:29.100
We usually have Oxy, methadone...
Special K, I think.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.769
We keep hard drugs on site?

29:30.852 --> 29:34.022
We don't keep it. PD comes by
every month or so and picks it up.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.524
[sighs]

29:36.608 --> 29:37.984
All right. Show me.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.240
BB?

29:48.119 --> 29:49.037
What up?

29:49.120 --> 29:51.873
[Crank] You made a wrong move,
blowin' out like you did.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.001
-What is up with you?
-We're for-real players now.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.463
Are you? Because there's Hatchets
and Tigers up there, and they're strapped.

29:58.546 --> 30:01.090
-You gonna take 'em out?
-Shifu will take care of them.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.092
Hurry, now. Through there.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.809
Get everybody back upstairs. Now.

30:11.601 --> 30:12.519
Go.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.546
[both grunting]

30:47.762 --> 30:48.763
[breathing heavily]

31:04.863 --> 31:07.907
Now, I know Ryhno
wasn't the sharpest dude,

31:07.991 --> 31:11.536
but he had our back when no one else did.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.621
And now he's dead.

31:14.664 --> 31:15.707
And for what? For what?

31:20.336 --> 31:21.629
Crank, man...

31:23.089 --> 31:26.134
whatever your Shifu says,
this isn't our fight.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.971
We get out of this now,
you still got choices.

31:30.054 --> 31:33.266
A future. We stay in...

31:36.185 --> 31:39.063
This neighborhood doesn't need martyrs,
it needs leaders.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.274
When you're right, you're right.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.527
-Chinatown does need leaders.
-For real, bro.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.945
-[knife plunging]
-[grunts]

31:52.160 --> 31:56.748
This is for real.
You ain't a leader. Shifu is.

31:56.831 --> 31:57.916
[grunting]

31:58.917 --> 31:59.751
BB. [groans]

32:05.882 --> 32:06.716
No!

32:33.076 --> 32:34.077
Brother.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.204
I think we're beyond that now, aren't we?

32:36.287 --> 32:37.997
You can't change your past.

32:38.581 --> 32:41.084
The other night when I saw you,
I could hardly believe it.

32:41.167 --> 32:45.505
But here you are, standing. Walking, even.

32:46.589 --> 32:49.592
If only you could put
that kind of resilience to better use.

32:50.885 --> 32:56.599
It's amazing what a dozen steel pins
and a high-powered magnet can do.

32:58.601 --> 33:02.522
It gave me no pleasure to cripple you,
but I will do worse without hesitation.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.566
Now, I'm here to retrieve the bowl.

33:06.275 --> 33:09.904
And eliminate those...
who stand against me.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.033
It isn't just Triad members here, Davos.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.412
This is a community center.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.914
Guilty by association. Move.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.458
[shouts] Move!

33:25.962 --> 33:27.130
[all grunting]

33:41.269 --> 33:42.311
BB?

33:42.395 --> 33:44.272
[grunting]

33:45.273 --> 33:46.566
[Crank] Kill her!

34:25.688 --> 34:27.356
BB. No.

34:28.524 --> 34:30.401
Somebody call an ambulance!

34:30.485 --> 34:32.612
BB, come on. BB.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.073
No!

34:35.156 --> 34:38.701
You once asked me if I could go back
and do it all differently, would I?

34:40.119 --> 34:42.205
Well, the answer is yes, I would.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.664
I abandoned our home.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.167
I abandoned our family.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.670
But worst of all, I abandoned you.
I'm sorry.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.757
I'm sorry for everything.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.511
You should never have borne the Fist.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.678
[sighs]

34:57.762 --> 34:58.888
Maybe you're right.

35:05.394 --> 35:06.646
But neither should you.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.023
[grunts]

35:09.107 --> 35:10.149
Ask yourself, Davos...

35:13.319 --> 35:14.946
why did your father call the fight?

35:15.029 --> 35:20.076
What does it matter? [panting]
They're dead. They're all dead!

35:40.596 --> 35:42.390
Was he trying to spare your pride?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.310
-Or did he know what you'd become?
-[shouts]

35:57.947 --> 35:59.323
[panting]

36:00.700 --> 36:03.536
I tried to reach you. I tried to help you.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.873
But you give me no choice.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.436
[Davos grunting]

36:33.441 --> 36:35.860
[Davos grunting]

37:08.434 --> 37:10.019
[Colleen] We stopped him.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.189
Come on. Come on.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.483
Come on, we stopped him.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.028
BB got his.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.656
And you're next.

37:21.739 --> 37:22.573
[grunting]

37:34.293 --> 37:35.962
I know what it's like...

37:37.129 --> 37:40.216
to be lost and angry.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.678
But all you have is your family.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.471
[police sirens wailing]

37:45.554 --> 37:47.181
Turn on them, you have nothing.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.557
[tires screeching]

37:52.937 --> 37:53.938
Police!

37:54.021 --> 37:56.357
-[officer] Freeze!
-Put your hands up!

37:57.108 --> 38:00.486
You so much as blink,
and we will put you down!

38:00.569 --> 38:01.821
[indistinct chatter]

38:09.954 --> 38:10.955
He killed BB.

38:17.753 --> 38:20.548
Central, requesting EMS
to Bayard Community Association.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.175
We have one victim, multiple stab wounds.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.310
I got here as soon as I could.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.439
I know what you're thinking.
It is not your fault.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.236
Look, I'm gonna tell you something,
and I know you're not gonna hear it,

38:42.320 --> 38:45.156
'cause it took me about a thousand times
before I did.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.409
You can't save everyone.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.245
All you can do is try.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.419
-He didn't deserve this.
-No, he did not.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.756
[sighs] Where's Danny?

39:02.465 --> 39:05.051
Oh, shit. Davos.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.977
[Misty] I got a call that Davos was here.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.106
Figured you could use the assist.
What the hell did you hit him with?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.067
-Ketamine, I think.
-[Misty] Okay.

39:21.984 --> 39:22.943
Hey, what happened?

39:27.865 --> 39:29.116
Her friend BB.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.286
[Danny] Oh, no.

39:35.247 --> 39:38.793
-We need to get him back to the dojo.
-For what exactly? We don't have the bowl.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.461
We do. BB brought it.

39:40.544 --> 39:44.715
Shit. Joy's still at Davos's place.
She's in danger.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.550
My guys still have to process
the crime scene.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.386
I'll give you cover
while you take Davos out,

39:48.469 --> 39:50.179
and then I'll head over and find Joy. Call the Crane Sisters.

39:52.723 --> 39:56.519
Tell 'em to get their kit...
whatever else they need to get me ready.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.731
-You're gonna do it?
-[Colleen sighs]

40:00.815 --> 40:01.941
What changed?

40:02.024 --> 40:05.528
I've been telling Mrs. Yang
to step up, help this community.

40:06.445 --> 40:09.532
How can I expect her to listen
if I won't take my own advice?

40:12.243 --> 40:15.287
What happened to BB is not my fault.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.457
But I can do more.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.334
Working here isn't enough.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.003
There are people, and they need help,
and they're out there.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.005
Are you sure about this?

40:25.089 --> 40:26.799
[sighing] Sure as I'm gonna be.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.178
I was so afraid of what I'd do
with a weapon in my hand.

40:32.179 --> 40:34.014
I'm not afraid anymore.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.438
We need to figure out a way
to get him back to the dojo.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.816
There's a van outside.
The one we use for field trips.

40:43.899 --> 40:46.652
-So, please, try not to wreck it.
-Thanks, Sam.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.367
When you're finished with him,
his ass is mine.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.958
I thought you were full of shit
when you came to the shop.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.335
Turns out you want some ink
after all, huh?

41:03.419 --> 41:05.087
What you thinkin'?

41:05.171 --> 41:07.673
-Unicorn?
-Dice on fire?

41:07.756 --> 41:09.300
[Colleen sighs] Don't even.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.762
Something between that
and that thing on his chest.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.850
Sure. We can do that.

41:20.269 --> 41:21.270
Okay. [Danny] Okay.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.304
[sighs]

42:16.575 --> 42:18.244
[breathing heavily]

43:11.130 --> 43:13.632
[dispatcher over radio]
<i>Detective Knight, what's your 20?</i>

43:14.800 --> 43:16.385
<i>Detective Knight, do you copy?</i>

43:33.110 --> 43:34.111
Shit.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.656
Joy.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.159
Joy.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.537
Behind you.

43:49.126 --> 43:51.211
[both grunting]

44:17.404 --> 44:18.405
[gunshot]

44:22.785 --> 44:24.828
Damn it. I thought it was Davos.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.457
The hell are you doing here?

44:29.124 --> 44:30.918
We're here for Joy.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.044
[groans]

44:32.544 --> 44:34.546
Oh, my God. What the hell happened?

44:34.630 --> 44:35.464
Ward.

44:35.547 --> 44:38.634
Did Davos do this to you?
I swear I'll kill him.

44:38.717 --> 44:42.388
Hey, you've done enough for tonight.
Just get your sister outta here.

44:42.471 --> 44:45.474
I need you to get topside,
call an ambulance.

44:45.557 --> 44:46.558
Let's go.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.186
[Misty] Hey, Meachum.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.605
Thank you. It's Ward.

44:52.856 --> 44:54.650
[Joy breathing heavily]

44:55.359 --> 44:57.111
Where did you get the gun?

44:57.194 --> 44:59.446
A van down by the river.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.700
-You're an idiot.
-You're welcome.

45:03.409 --> 45:06.578
I think you caught an artery,
but we're gonna get you some help.

45:07.162 --> 45:07.996
[gunshots]

45:08.831 --> 45:10.290
He wasn't gonna make it.

45:12.251 --> 45:14.628
It was better
to put him out of his misery.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.341
Don't.

45:20.426 --> 45:21.552
[sighs]

45:21.635 --> 45:23.053
You're not a cop killer.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.305
No, I'm not.

45:27.266 --> 45:28.600
[Misty grunts]

45:28.684 --> 45:29.685
[coughs] [panting]

45:35.315 --> 45:38.068
-Is it done?
-How do you feel?

45:40.362 --> 45:42.072
[Colleen breathing heavily]

45:57.921 --> 45:59.506
Let's finish this.

46:15.606 --> 46:17.357
Put your thumb to his third eye.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.821
Then wrap your fingers around like this.

46:23.989 --> 46:24.990
[softly] Okay.

46:25.073 --> 46:27.534
Then you draw the heart of the dragon
into you.

46:30.496 --> 46:31.538
Will it hurt?

46:33.248 --> 46:34.333
Yes.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.960
But then it will be a part of you.

46:37.461 --> 46:38.462
[sighs]

47:02.402 --> 47:05.239
[both groaning]

47:10.452 --> 47:11.745
-Colleen, move!
-[Davos screams]

47:16.625 --> 47:17.626
[panting] Colleen?

47:20.546 --> 47:22.714
[gasps and coughs]

47:23.924 --> 47:24.842
Ah.

47:26.385 --> 47:27.386
[breathing heavily]

47:32.099 --> 47:33.517
You failed, Danny.

47:43.318 --> 47:44.361
Come on, then.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.198
-Come on.
-[Colleen groans]

47:49.283 --> 47:50.617
You all right?

47:50.701 --> 47:52.953
No. It's burning.
