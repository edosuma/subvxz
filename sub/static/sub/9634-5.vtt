02:04.584 --> 02:05.584
[splashing]

02:05.667 --> 02:07.500
[engine humming]

02:07.584 --> 02:10.667
[NARRATOR] With only two
more Dragon Balls left to find,

02:10.750 --> 02:14.375
our heroes, Goku and Bulma
are heading into very dangerous

02:14.459 --> 02:17.834
territory as they
continue their search.

02:17.917 --> 02:20.834
Joining them in their quest
is Oolong, the perverse pig

02:20.917 --> 02:23.625
who can change his
appearance at will.

02:25.250 --> 02:28.459
[engine humming]

02:28.542 --> 02:30.459
[BULMA] It was a good idea
to travel down this river.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.750
We're making awesome time!

02:32.834 --> 02:33.792
That's great!

02:33.875 --> 02:35.750
But why is Oolong
coming with us?

02:35.834 --> 02:38.000
I think she's got
a thing for me, kid!

02:38.084 --> 02:40.125
I thought Oolong's
special powers might come

02:40.209 --> 02:42.625
in handy. That's why
he's coming along.

02:42.709 --> 02:44.042
Hey, what do you mean?!

02:44.125 --> 02:45.959
Are you tryin' to
say I'm not your type?

02:46.042 --> 02:49.750
Exactly! I'm looking for
tall, dark, and handsome!

02:50.959 --> 02:52.375
Just give it
time, honey!

02:52.459 --> 02:54.250
You'll see, "I'm the man"!

02:55.000 --> 02:57.625
[OOLONG squealing]

02:57.709 --> 03:00.084
Hey, back off kid!
I ain't that kinda pig!

03:00.167 --> 03:01.709
You were right!
You are a man!

03:01.792 --> 03:03.959
Of course I'm
a man, you imbecile!

03:04.042 --> 03:06.292
What more do you want?
I'll take a polygraph,

03:06.375 --> 03:10.000
give a blood sample, just
don't ever do that again!

03:10.084 --> 03:11.459
[growling]

03:19.667 --> 03:25.917
[engine humming]

03:26.000 --> 03:28.667
Hey Bulma,
how much further?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.875
Well, we should
almost be there by now.

03:30.959 --> 03:33.292
This map will tell us exactly.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.334
We've been driving
forever already!

03:36.417 --> 03:38.584
Where in the world
are we going??

03:38.667 --> 03:41.625
We're going to a place
called "Fire Mountain".

03:41.709 --> 03:43.125
Fire Mountain?!

03:43.209 --> 03:45.834
Are you crazy?! There's no
way you're draggin' me anywhere

03:45.917 --> 03:46.959
near that place!

03:47.042 --> 03:48.042
[squealing]

03:48.125 --> 03:49.625
[GOKU] What's so
scary about a mountain?

03:49.709 --> 03:52.167
For starters, the place
is always on fire, and it's the

03:52.250 --> 03:55.375
home of the terrible Ox-King!
Do you understand now?

03:55.459 --> 03:56.875
That bad, huh?

03:56.959 --> 03:57.917
[OOLONG] Mm-hmm.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.292
[BULMA] Relax, Oolong.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.834
Goku's strong enough to
take care of some old "ox".

04:01.584 --> 04:03.000
[OOLONG] I don't
know about that.

04:03.084 --> 04:05.709
I've heard the Ox-King is the
strongest guy in the whole

04:05.792 --> 04:08.750
world! They say he's over
ten feet tall and weighs

04:08.834 --> 04:13.084
500 pounds. And he's always on
the prowl for anyone who might

04:13.167 --> 04:17.041
try to climb up the mountain to
get to his castle. He carries a

04:17.125 --> 04:20.125
giant battle axe, and let me
tell you, he knows how to use

04:20.209 --> 04:23.375
it too! He's been terrorizing
the countryside for years,

04:23.459 --> 04:26.834
and they say that if you meet
the Ox-King, there's only one

04:26.917 --> 04:31.709
thing you can do: Run! 'Cause
if he catches you, you'll get

04:31.792 --> 04:33.500
a really "close shave"!

04:34.334 --> 04:35.792
You really heard that?

04:35.875 --> 04:37.625
[OOLONG] Uh-huh!

04:38.042 --> 04:39.834
[GOKU] Sounds like
the guy's not very happy.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.417
[OOLONG] Exactly!
He's radically unhappy!

04:45.167 --> 04:47.209
Well, I'm outta here!

04:47.625 --> 04:49.000
[BULMA] Hey!

04:50.584 --> 04:52.500
[GOKU] Don't worry
Bulma. I'll get him!

04:54.292 --> 04:55.084
Careful!

05:02.125 --> 05:04.375
Ah, Sassa-fras'n school of fish!

05:04.459 --> 05:05.584
Never did like school!

05:08.167 --> 05:09.667
This kid's crazy!

05:12.209 --> 05:15.000
I don't see him anywhere.
Where'd he go?

05:22.709 --> 05:24.417
I lost him, Bulma!

05:24.500 --> 05:27.584
Well, if you want to
catch a fish, you gotta use

05:27.667 --> 05:29.375
the right kind of bait.

05:30.709 --> 05:32.084
[BULMA] Like this!

05:32.917 --> 05:34.125
Do you think he'll bite?

05:34.209 --> 05:35.834
If I know
Oolong, he will!

05:41.750 --> 05:42.834
[BULMA] I think
I've got a nibble.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.000
Yeah! Grab him, Goku!

05:48.584 --> 05:50.834
Hey, whaddaya know,
he bit your shorts!

05:56.792 --> 05:58.209
Hey, why is all
the food gone?

05:58.292 --> 05:59.834
Did you make a pig of yourself?

05:59.917 --> 06:02.750
Unfortunate choice of words,
but the great outdoors

06:02.834 --> 06:04.334
do make me hungry.

06:04.417 --> 06:07.167
[BULMA] Here, take this special
vitamin. It'll fill you up,

06:07.250 --> 06:08.500
and give you strength!

06:08.584 --> 06:10.667
It doesn't look like much,
but I'll try it.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.917
[BULMA] It's made from
all natural ingredients.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.625
It's very good for you.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.834
I just hope you
health nuts don't eat pork.

06:18.709 --> 06:20.334
[BULMA giggling]

06:20.417 --> 06:22.459
[GOKU] Hey, Bulma!
What about me?

06:22.542 --> 06:23.709
I'm hungry too!

06:23.792 --> 06:25.292
Uh, that was
the last one.

06:25.375 --> 06:27.209
See, kid?
It's my hoggish allure.

06:27.292 --> 06:28.667
I'm not your
average porker!

06:29.000 --> 06:30.417
[engine sputtering]

06:30.500 --> 06:31.875
[ALL] Huh?!

06:35.750 --> 06:37.875
That's great!
We're outta gas!

06:38.625 --> 06:41.042
Is that sorta like
being out of food?

06:41.125 --> 06:43.792
Very good, that's exactly
what it's like Goku.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.084
Then let's just
feed the boat.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.750
Hey, Oolong, can you
change into a tank of gas?

06:48.834 --> 06:50.917
Against union rules, honey!

06:51.000 --> 06:52.959
Besides, I'd get all used up.

06:53.042 --> 06:56.084
[BULMA] Then how about a paddle
just to help us get to shore?

06:56.167 --> 06:58.292
[OOLONG] I'd be honored
to be "handled" by a

06:58.375 --> 06:59.625
girl like you, Bulma.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.459
Showtime!

07:05.709 --> 07:07.667
Just go like this in the water,
and we'll move.

07:08.792 --> 07:10.584
Wow, that's really neat!

07:10.667 --> 07:12.709
[GOKU] Ha ha ha, yeah!

07:12.792 --> 07:18.125
[OOLONG sputtering]

07:18.209 --> 07:20.250
[OOLONG] Hey! Watch
the water in the mouth,

07:20.334 --> 07:22.167
you muscle-bound midget!

07:22.250 --> 07:23.959
[GOKU laughing]

07:24.959 --> 07:26.500
I gotta go, Bulma!

07:26.584 --> 07:28.375
[BULMA] Don't be gone long!

07:30.709 --> 07:33.084
[BULMA] Goku!
Really, that kid...

07:33.167 --> 07:34.417
Well, it's too
bad we couldn't make

07:34.500 --> 07:35.917
it to Fire Mountain!

07:36.000 --> 07:37.542
I hate to disappoint you,
Oolong,

07:37.625 --> 07:39.834
but we're
practically there already.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.542
But it's
crazy to go there!

07:41.625 --> 07:43.375
It's way too dangerous!

07:46.375 --> 07:49.792
My... my Dyno Caps!
They're missing!

07:49.875 --> 07:52.625
No! Aah! We're trapped in
a wasteland with no way

07:52.709 --> 07:54.334
to get out!

07:54.875 --> 07:57.750
I think you took our Dyno Caps,
just like you stole our lunch,

07:57.834 --> 07:59.209
you little porker!

07:59.292 --> 08:02.417
Hey! I resent
being called little!

08:02.500 --> 08:04.000
[BULMA screaming]

08:04.084 --> 08:06.875
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

08:07.542 --> 08:10.167
You don't understand!
Without the Dyno-Caps

08:10.250 --> 08:14.542
we're stuck here! No boats!
No bikes! Nothing! Nada!

08:14.625 --> 08:15.459
But...

08:18.334 --> 08:20.459
Why can't you just walk, Bulma?

08:20.542 --> 08:21.375
That's easy for you to say!

08:21.459 --> 08:23.500
You can ride the Flying Nimbus!

08:24.250 --> 08:27.250
[OOLONG chuckling]
So long, suckers!

08:27.334 --> 08:29.292
Well, why don't you just
have Oolong change into a

08:29.375 --> 08:32.000
motorbike, and then
ride him outta here?

08:32.083 --> 08:33.833
[BULMA] Oh! That's a
great idea, Goku.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.333
I'm glad I thought of it!

08:35.417 --> 08:37.792
Hey! Oolong, dear?

08:37.875 --> 08:39.167
Huh?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.042
Ahh! He ditched us!

08:41.125 --> 08:43.750
[GOKU] Don't worry,
Bulma. I'll go get him!

08:45.292 --> 08:47.875
[GOKU] Hey, Oolong
where are you?

08:48.334 --> 08:50.875
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

08:51.459 --> 08:53.625
You can't hide forever!

08:53.959 --> 08:55.792
Hey, oh, Oolong!

08:56.292 --> 08:59.084
If you come out I'll give
you a nice juicy pail of slop!

09:01.792 --> 09:03.750
[OOLONG] If he thinks I'm
dumb enough to fall for the

09:03.834 --> 09:06.375
old 'juicy pail of
slop' routine, then he's

09:06.459 --> 09:07.417
even dumber than I thought!

09:10.917 --> 09:12.959
There's no sign of
him anywhere, Bulma.

09:13.042 --> 09:16.500
Oh! I knew I
couldn't trust him!

09:16.584 --> 09:19.667
Piggy Piggy Piggy Piggy!

09:19.750 --> 09:22.042
Piggy Piggy Piggy!

09:22.125 --> 09:23.334
[BULMA] Piggy Piggy!

09:23.417 --> 09:26.417
[intense rumbling]

09:26.500 --> 09:28.250
[OOLONG] What's wrong
with my poor stomach?!

09:30.375 --> 09:34.834
Woah! Oh, oh, I'm gonna blow!

09:37.959 --> 09:40.542
[intense diarrhea]

09:41.000 --> 09:45.042
Hey! Hey, Oolong!
What's the matter, little piggy?

09:45.125 --> 09:46.792
You know that
vitamin I gave you?

09:46.875 --> 09:49.334
It's really a pill that makes
you have to go "squatty potty"

09:49.417 --> 09:51.709
anytime someone makes
the "Piggy" sound!

09:51.792 --> 09:54.792
[BULMA] You're
not going anywhere!

09:54.875 --> 09:57.459
Oh, that's perfect!

09:57.542 --> 09:59.709
Huh, guess I've
got you under my power

09:59.792 --> 10:01.417
now, little piggy!

10:06.875 --> 10:08.625
[BULMA] What's with you?

10:08.709 --> 10:09.667
You're a witch!

10:09.750 --> 10:12.000
You cast a spell
on Oolong, admit it!

10:12.084 --> 10:14.459
Oh Goku,
don't be so naive!

10:14.542 --> 10:17.042
If I were a witch I wouldn't
need the Dragon Balls to

10:17.125 --> 10:20.000
grant my wishes. That pill
was just a little bit of science

10:20.084 --> 10:21.709
to control cowards like--

10:21.792 --> 10:23.084
[OOLONG] Cheap shot!

10:23.542 --> 10:27.375
Lucky for me I brought
some toilet paper along.

10:27.459 --> 10:30.292
So, I trust my little
pill will keep you in line?

10:30.375 --> 10:31.500
Yeah...

10:32.875 --> 10:35.875
Yeah, I'll be "in line"
to get in the bathroom,

10:35.959 --> 10:37.292
that's for sure!

10:37.375 --> 10:39.042
I'll bet this kind of
stuff wouldn't happen

10:39.125 --> 10:40.500
if you acted nicer!

10:40.584 --> 10:42.500
I can still
take ya, kid!

10:42.584 --> 10:46.584
Oh? Piggy
piggy piggy! Piggy!

10:46.667 --> 10:49.084
[grunting]

10:49.167 --> 10:51.584
[intense diarrhea]

10:51.667 --> 10:53.667
I'll get you for this!

10:53.750 --> 10:56.709
[GOKU laughing]

10:56.792 --> 10:59.459
Well, I need my
motorcycle now, Oolong!

11:00.375 --> 11:01.750
You lazy...

11:06.875 --> 11:08.417
Huh? Hey, this
isn't exactly what

11:08.500 --> 11:10.292
I had in mind, Oolong!

11:10.375 --> 11:12.917
Me either, toots.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.417
Oh well. Let's go.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.459
Can't you do
anything right?!

11:21.542 --> 11:23.500
What do we do now, pork chop?

11:24.584 --> 11:26.209
Look, you amazon!

11:26.292 --> 11:28.375
Do you think it's fun being
squashed to the ground

11:28.459 --> 11:30.167
by a horse like you?!

11:31.834 --> 11:33.292
So that's the
thanks I get.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.542
What's the use anyway?

11:34.625 --> 11:36.584
I can only hold a new
shape for five minutes,

11:36.667 --> 11:37.584
then--poof!

11:39.292 --> 11:41.292
Everyone thinks
shape-changing makes you

11:41.375 --> 11:44.500
stronger that you really are,
but it don't. I couldn't even

11:44.584 --> 11:46.834
carry you outta
here, if I wanted to.

11:46.917 --> 11:49.084
But, I've got another idea.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.209
[screaming]

11:51.959 --> 11:54.084
Here, how's this, Bulma?

11:55.084 --> 11:57.750
[OOLONG] Put me on and then
only one of us has to walk!

11:57.834 --> 12:01.959
You pervert! Take that!

12:06.792 --> 12:09.209
Next time, maybe you
should try being her hat!

12:27.292 --> 12:29.334
[NARRATOR ] Continuing
their journey on foot,

12:29.417 --> 12:32.459
Bulma, Oolong, and
Goku press on into the

12:32.542 --> 12:36.459
uncharted,
unexplored. and uncool.

12:36.542 --> 12:40.542
[panting]

12:40.625 --> 12:43.500
I gave up riding my
cloud to walk with you two,

12:43.584 --> 12:44.875
now try and keep up!

12:44.959 --> 12:47.167
[BULMA] Just remember:
you're not a city kid, Goku.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.459
You're used to the
wilderness, but I'm not!

12:49.542 --> 12:51.125
I should be pampered!

12:51.209 --> 12:53.417
My gosh, look
at this place!

12:54.125 --> 12:56.000
[OOLONG] Yeah,
something's not right.

12:56.084 --> 12:58.417
I keep getting the
feeling we're being watched.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.292
It's giving me the creeps!

13:00.667 --> 13:03.417
I can't stand
it! I'm going crazy!

13:03.500 --> 13:04.542
Are you giving up?

13:04.625 --> 13:09.500
[BULMA] No! Yes...
Maybe? I don't know!

13:11.042 --> 13:13.417
I want a bath!
I need air-conditioning!

13:13.500 --> 13:15.709
I don't want to be stranded
in the desert without a

13:15.792 --> 13:17.875
boyfriend or my
Dyno-Caps anymore!

13:17.959 --> 13:19.667
Her passion for
self-centeredness

13:19.750 --> 13:21.167
inspires even me.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.542
You sure are strange,
Oolong.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.334
[BULMA] Ahh, shade.
Nap-time...

13:26.417 --> 13:28.875
I say we just let
her rest for a while.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.584
Suits me!

13:31.667 --> 13:34.750
I sure am hungry. Uhh.

13:39.375 --> 13:40.500
[CAT] Victims.

13:45.084 --> 13:48.250
[CAT] Yamcha! Yamcha!

13:48.334 --> 13:49.792
Victims! Woo hoo!

13:51.417 --> 13:54.417
Well. it's about time.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.084
[laughing]

14:00.417 --> 14:03.375
[YAMCHA] We've had quite a dry
spell since we hijacked that

14:03.459 --> 14:05.209
caravan, haven't we, Puar?

14:05.292 --> 14:06.917
They're right down there,
Yamcha.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.209
Can you see them?
Can you see them?

14:09.292 --> 14:11.917
[YAMCHA] Only two? No problem.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.584
[OOLONG] I'm starving over here!

14:15.667 --> 14:18.125
I'm gonna go
find us some food.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.292
Do you like bacon?

14:20.375 --> 14:21.834
What are
you, brain dead?!

14:23.542 --> 14:25.834
[OOLONG] I think I
hear something.

14:26.334 --> 14:31.709
[humming]

14:31.792 --> 14:34.084
[GOKU] What is it?

14:34.167 --> 14:35.792
It ain't no camel!

14:35.875 --> 14:48.459
[engine roaring]

14:48.542 --> 14:51.542
[giggling]

15:01.209 --> 15:02.542
Greetings.

15:08.334 --> 15:09.417
I am Yamcha.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.959
I am master of the
land you trespass upon.

15:12.042 --> 15:14.542
It's my land, too!

15:15.334 --> 15:17.625
You needn't fear me.
Just hand over your money and

15:17.709 --> 15:21.084
any Dyno-Caps you may have and
I will let you pass in peace.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.042
You're Puar!

15:23.125 --> 15:25.459
We went to
shape-shifting acadamy together.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.500
[PUAR] I remember!

15:26.584 --> 15:28.084
And you were a
loud-mouthed bully!

15:28.167 --> 15:30.750
He always picked on me and stole
my lunch money, because I was

15:30.834 --> 15:32.250
smaller than him!

15:33.042 --> 15:35.250
I'd say the tables
have turned, my friend.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.417
How does it feel to
face someone bigger

15:37.500 --> 15:39.042
than yourself, little piglet?

15:39.125 --> 15:40.417
This guy looks pretty tough,
kid.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.709
Think you can take him?

15:41.792 --> 15:43.542
It's just like in the old days.

15:43.625 --> 15:48.167
The swine still hides behind
someone whenever he's afraid!

15:48.250 --> 15:49.625
Not much courage, huh?

15:49.709 --> 15:50.709
That's right!

15:50.792 --> 15:53.834
Not an ounce of
courage on that porker!

15:53.917 --> 15:57.959
Puar, if I ever
get my hands on you...

15:58.042 --> 15:59.625
Sounds like you
haven't changed much over

15:59.709 --> 16:01.459
the years, Oolong.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.459
Okay boys, enough talk.

16:03.542 --> 16:07.084
Either hand over your goods
or prepare to fight me.

16:09.209 --> 16:11.375
Just how strong
are you Goku?

16:11.459 --> 16:12.709
I'm super strong.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.042
All right, big shot!

16:14.125 --> 16:16.000
The bigger you are
the harder you fall!

16:16.084 --> 16:19.167
You may think you're looking at
an easy haul here, but my man

16:19.250 --> 16:22.334
will slap you two silly before
it's all said and done!

16:26.334 --> 16:27.959
[YAMCHA] Prepare to
defend yourself.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.042
[PUAR] Make pork chops
out of him, Yamcha!

16:31.125 --> 16:32.917
He can't talk to you like that!

16:33.292 --> 16:34.709
[OOLONG] Just a second.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.709
All right! Destroy
'em little buddy!

16:36.792 --> 16:38.917
Oolong, why should I
want to destroy this guy?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.042
Did he hurt somebody?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.667
[OOLONG] Haven't you
been listening, kid?

16:42.750 --> 16:45.042
That sword isn't made
outta rubber you know.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.834
He plans to kill us!

16:46.917 --> 16:48.959
[GOKU] I don't want to fight
you, but if I have to defend

16:49.042 --> 16:51.042
my friends, I will!

16:51.125 --> 16:53.292
I admire your bravery, kid.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.292
Is it bravery or stupidity?

16:55.375 --> 16:59.292
[snoring]

16:59.375 --> 17:01.542
Geez, I thought
it was an earthquake!

17:01.625 --> 17:05.084
[snoring]

17:05.166 --> 17:13.875
Hyaah!

17:13.959 --> 17:16.791
Hi-ya!

17:25.791 --> 17:27.916
Hyaah!

17:41.000 --> 17:42.542
[clank]

17:44.834 --> 17:46.542
Power Pole, extend!

17:53.750 --> 17:55.125
Unbelievable!

17:55.209 --> 17:56.250
Believe it!

17:56.334 --> 17:57.959
The kid's winning
this one, isn't he?!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.667
You have great power for
a little one, don't you?

18:02.750 --> 18:05.042
[GOKU] Thank you.
My Grandpa trained me.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.417
[YAMCHA] Ahh. The pole.
the extending Power Pole.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.167
Only one man could
have given that to you.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.750
Who is this
grandfather of yours?

18:13.834 --> 18:15.917
His name was Gohan.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.792
And he died a long time ago.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.292
I knew of him.
But even with your magic pole

18:21.375 --> 18:23.292
and all that he
may have taught you,

18:23.375 --> 18:26.709
I'm afraid you are
still no match for me.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.459
[YAMCHA] I will
have that pole's power.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.625
Give it to me or prepare
to fight to the death!

18:32.500 --> 18:34.417
Uh-oh.
We're lunch meat now!

18:38.584 --> 18:40.542
I'm starving!

18:41.542 --> 18:45.334
You're not the only one
with special powers, kid.

18:47.834 --> 18:48.917
Watch this!

18:52.584 --> 18:54.500
Wolf Fang Fist!

18:55.334 --> 18:56.834
[wolf howling]

18:56.917 --> 19:00.084
--[wolf howling]
--[YAMCHA yelling]

19:00.167 --> 19:03.709
[YAMCHA yelling]

19:03.792 --> 19:05.375
[blow landing]

19:06.375 --> 19:10.834
[blows landing]

19:12.750 --> 19:21.667
[crashing]

19:21.750 --> 19:24.042
[OOLONG] Guess we
won't need a headstone.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.500
Why do I always
back the loser?

19:29.584 --> 19:31.792
Why does it always
have to happen this way??

19:31.875 --> 19:33.667
Now he'll come for me!

19:34.834 --> 19:36.542
[OOLONG] Gee, I'd love to
stay and fight with you,

19:36.625 --> 19:37.584
but I gotta fly!

19:42.167 --> 19:43.209
Now's your chance, Puar!

19:43.292 --> 19:44.000
Get him!

19:44.084 --> 19:46.167
Right. With pleasure!

19:51.875 --> 19:53.084
You mangy mongrel!

19:53.167 --> 19:55.209
What'dya go and do that for?

19:55.292 --> 19:58.000
I owed you one, Oolong!

19:58.084 --> 20:01.667
[YAMCHA] Now, my worthless
adversary, either hand over what

20:01.750 --> 20:04.042
you have or join your friend.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.792
That's a choice, huh?

20:06.334 --> 20:09.334
There's absolutely nothing
worse than getting ripped off.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.500
[YAMCHA] Make it snappy, pig.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.750
My patience with
you is wearing thin.

20:13.209 --> 20:16.709
[rumbling]

20:16.792 --> 20:19.209
Gotta get some food...

20:19.292 --> 20:19.959
[YAMCHA] Thank you!

20:20.042 --> 20:21.167
[GOKU] Hold It!

20:21.250 --> 20:23.375
Right now, I've had just
about enough of you!

20:24.084 --> 20:25.709
If you've truly had enough, kid.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.875
go back to sleep
amongst the rubble and

20:27.959 --> 20:30.292
don't provoke me again.

20:30.375 --> 20:34.917
Come on. I'm just
getting warmed up, you know.

20:43.167 --> 20:48.334
[blows landing]

20:49.375 --> 20:51.625
[crash]

20:54.667 --> 20:56.459
That's it, kid!

20:56.542 --> 21:00.584
[shouting]

21:00.667 --> 21:03.167
Oh boy, I think I'm
gonna die if I don't get

21:03.250 --> 21:04.417
something to eat.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.250
Why're you just
standing there Goku?

21:06.334 --> 21:07.167
Do something!

21:07.625 --> 21:11.667
[screaming]

21:11.750 --> 21:12.959
Gee whiz, you guys.

21:13.042 --> 21:14.584
What's all the screaming about?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.459
[YAMCHA] She's gorgeous!

21:29.584 --> 21:31.917
[tea kettle whistling]

21:34.250 --> 21:36.125
Master, you okay?

21:36.209 --> 21:39.375
Puar, you know I have
trouble around beautiful women!

21:39.459 --> 21:40.334
I know.

21:46.250 --> 21:49.500
Well, I guess we put
them on the run, didn't we?

21:49.584 --> 21:51.500
Hey, you guys,
who was that hunk?

21:51.584 --> 21:53.625
He looked absolutely dreamy!

21:56.125 --> 21:58.125
Oh, wow!

21:58.209 --> 21:59.625
Can we eat now?

22:01.834 --> 22:05.084
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
back in Yamcha's hideout.

22:05.167 --> 22:08.417
[YAMCHA] A warrior toppled
by a girl is humiliating!

22:08.500 --> 22:11.000
Yamcha, she had
nothing to do with it.

22:11.084 --> 22:13.000
You just tripped!

22:13.875 --> 22:18.292
That's a lie, Puar!
I froze when I saw her.

22:18.375 --> 22:21.000
But I will overcome
my fear of women.

22:21.084 --> 22:24.834
Those fools have not
heard the last of Yamcha!

22:24.917 --> 22:27.000
[NARRATOR] It would seem that
our heroes haven't seen the last

22:27.084 --> 22:30.709
of Yamcha, the desert
bandit. Join us again for the

22:30.792 --> 22:33.084
next episode of Dragon Ball!
