WEBVTT

00:00.932 --> 00:02.532
Just come, Nick. Why not?

00:02.600 --> 00:05.468
Angie and I are not
romantic weekend types.

00:05.536 --> 00:07.970
Sounds like you need
some fresh air in a cabin

00:08.938 --> 00:10.405
You're dating a stripper.

00:10.473 --> 00:12.106
I'm dating a tall, handsome doctor.

00:12.174 --> 00:13.775
We're both kind of living the dream.

00:13.842 --> 00:14.809
We're not "dating."

00:14.877 --> 00:16.077
What Angie and I have together

00:16.078 --> 00:17.946
is pure anarchy

00:18.013 --> 00:19.747
in like, a sexy, cool way.

00:19.815 --> 00:20.835
Oh, yeah?

00:20.836 --> 00:22.556
Look at what she did
while I was sleeping.

00:22.557 --> 00:23.557
Look at how cool that is.

00:23.558 --> 00:24.953
She doodled on your armpit?

00:25.020 --> 00:27.060
- It's not a doodle, it's a tat.
- Of poodle hair?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.847
It's not poodle hair.
It's like the, uh...

00:29.522 --> 00:30.482
Anyway, no to the cabin.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.180
- All right.
- And why do you want us to come

00:33.181 --> 00:34.461
on your romantic weekend anyhow?

00:34.528 --> 00:36.808
I thought it was just supposed
to be you and the doctor.

00:36.809 --> 00:37.889
Okay, I'm a little nervous.

00:37.890 --> 00:39.099
I just need backup.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.326
I want this weekend to be fun

00:40.327 --> 00:42.535
and perfect

00:42.604 --> 00:45.371
and lovely, and I want him
to look at me at the end and go,

00:45.439 --> 00:47.773
"Jess, that was the best weekend
I ever had."

00:47.841 --> 00:50.441
I'm glad you're keeping your
expectations at a reasonable level.

00:50.442 --> 00:51.544
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:51.612 --> 00:53.179
- Roast marshmallows,
- Yeah.

00:53.247 --> 00:54.780
- Make a fire,
- Oh, yeah.

00:54.848 --> 00:56.149
And sleep on a bear rug.

00:56.217 --> 00:58.218
- You in?
- Ooh, no.

00:58.285 --> 00:59.605
Jess, I'm sorry.
We're not going

00:59.606 --> 01:00.766
- this weekend.
- All right.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.187
But it's free.

01:02.255 --> 01:03.188
- You say free?
- Yep.

01:03.256 --> 01:04.456
Yeah, we're 100% in.

01:04.524 --> 01:06.158
- I'll go pack now.
- Okay.

01:06.226 --> 01:08.227

01:08.294 --> 01:09.828

Oh, wait, wait, wait,
keep this in mind, right?

01:17.724 --> 01:19.724
Now, I have a spatula in
my hand the entire time,

01:19.725 --> 01:21.805
and I'm looking her directly
in the eye, and I say,

01:21.806 --> 01:23.326
"You're damn right
I want some cake."

01:23.375 --> 01:25.243
Kind of weird.

01:25.310 --> 01:26.870
Hey, what's up?
Guys, this is Schmidt.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.512
Hey.

01:27.579 --> 01:28.679
Ready to go?

01:28.747 --> 01:29.847
Yeah, no, let's do it.

01:29.914 --> 01:31.181
It's nice meeting you all.

01:31.249 --> 01:33.250
Hey, uh, Winston,

01:33.822 --> 01:34.582
who are those guys?

01:34.583 --> 01:36.903
I don't know, I just met them
on the way to the bathroom.

01:36.904 --> 01:38.304
But you were so light and charming.

01:38.305 --> 01:39.425
You were like Pixar Winston.

01:39.426 --> 01:40.746
Yeah, we were just chilling, man,

01:40.747 --> 01:41.858
just having a conversation.

01:41.925 --> 01:42.925
We can stay, if you want.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.320
No, Schmidt, I don't want to stay.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.328
I want to eat.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.263
Come on, man.

01:49.999 --> 01:52.100
White Nick, brown Cece.

01:52.169 --> 01:54.570
I'd like to have
a frank discussion about race.

01:54.638 --> 01:56.472
Do you think that we're

01:56.540 --> 01:58.574
allowing Winston
to be his blackest self?

01:58.642 --> 02:01.282
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Okay, make sure Jess gets these, okay?

02:01.283 --> 02:02.563
Guys, please, I'm being serious.

02:02.564 --> 02:03.164
Okay, Schmidty,

02:03.165 --> 02:04.485
I know that you're being serious,

02:04.513 --> 02:07.815
but look, Winston has been black
his entire life.

02:08.383 --> 02:09.743
I think he knows how to handle it.

02:09.744 --> 02:11.319
We were out the other night for drinks,

02:11.387 --> 02:14.720
and well, he encountered
some members of his own,

02:15.291 --> 02:17.758
and you should have seen
the way that he lit up.

02:17.826 --> 02:19.959
I mean, he was like a glow stick.

02:20.027 --> 02:20.707
This is terrible.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.428
Whatever you were gonna
do, please do not.

02:22.429 --> 02:23.989
- Just don't do it.
- I want to create

02:23.990 --> 02:26.310
an environment within this loft
where Winston feels free,

02:26.311 --> 02:28.202
where the gates are open.
Let's let Winston

02:28.269 --> 02:30.404
turn on his-his black switch

02:30.971 --> 02:32.406
and let his black light shine.

02:34.674 --> 02:35.541
<i>This is perfect.</i>

02:35.609 --> 02:37.610
Yes, it is a weekend in the woods.

02:37.678 --> 02:40.178
I'm just glad that we get
to spend some time together.

02:40.246 --> 02:41.346
Yeah.

02:43.148 --> 02:44.049
Hey.

02:44.117 --> 02:45.251
Yeah!

02:45.319 --> 02:46.686
Oh, look, it's Jackie O.

02:46.753 --> 02:48.654
- Me? All right, thanks.
- Yeah, you.

02:48.722 --> 02:51.322
Sorry we're late. I had to stop
and buy this bitch-ass a helmet.

02:51.390 --> 02:53.150
Because he wouldn't
stop being a bitch-ass.

02:53.151 --> 02:54.593
The helmet we got at a rest stop,

02:54.660 --> 02:56.127
the shades are mine.

02:56.195 --> 02:57.229
Yeah.

02:57.296 --> 02:59.464
Free cabin! Whoo!

02:59.532 --> 03:01.065
It's actually my boss's cabin.

03:01.133 --> 03:03.602
- That's great! Whoo!
- Yeah! USA, USA!

03:06.605 --> 03:08.105
Indian food, dinner? You down?

03:08.172 --> 03:09.627
I thought maybe we'd eat at a place

03:09.628 --> 03:11.428
where you wanted to eat
at tonight, Winston.

03:11.993 --> 03:14.245
As a strong black man.

03:14.812 --> 03:15.450
What?

03:15.451 --> 03:17.531
- What are you talking about?
- Hey, man, I get it.

03:17.532 --> 03:19.252
There are just some nights
where I'm dying

03:19.253 --> 03:20.253
for my zadie's egg salad,

03:21.218 --> 03:22.953
pastrami piled a mile high,

03:23.020 --> 03:24.887
some matzo, kreplach...

03:25.455 --> 03:26.856
Let's eat some soul food.

03:26.923 --> 03:28.563
Schmidt, I want Indian,
southern Indian.

03:28.592 --> 03:30.025
Also, I got you something.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.034
- Jah rastafari.
- Take this damn thing off my head.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.536
Okay, I'm sorry.
You're right.

03:41.604 --> 03:43.204
Forget the hat.
Just, I made a mistake.

03:43.205 --> 03:43.905
I just...

03:45.541 --> 03:47.376
Winston, tonight is about you.

03:47.443 --> 03:49.578
I want to be the black friend
that you never had.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.112
I have black friends, Schmidt.

03:51.180 --> 03:52.340
I want you to feel supported.

03:52.348 --> 03:53.968
I want you to be able to do

03:53.969 --> 03:55.969
the things that you don't feel
like I understand.

03:58.754 --> 04:00.821
Okay. So that means
you're gonna do

04:00.889 --> 04:03.672
- whatever I say?
- I mean, as long as it's gangster.

04:03.673 --> 04:06.033
- Or not. It doesn't have to be gangster.
- Well, Schmidt,

04:06.034 --> 04:07.994
I want to say thank you
for allowing me to be me

04:07.995 --> 04:09.155
and I look forward to sharing

04:09.156 --> 04:10.636
my people's culture with you tonight.

04:12.566 --> 04:15.134
I've never played sexy Boggle before.

04:15.202 --> 04:18.535
I'm gonna get into that later.

04:18.706 --> 04:19.639
Ow-ooh!

04:19.707 --> 04:21.808
Oops. Okay.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.176
Hey, guys.

04:23.243 --> 04:25.878
Sorry, we were just unpacking.

04:25.946 --> 04:27.913
We could hear very clearly.
Very clearly.

04:27.980 --> 04:29.620
Hey, you got
a high-pitched scream, man.

04:29.621 --> 04:31.016
Yeah, I do.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.118
So, you guys, we are
playing best of 35,

04:33.186 --> 04:35.454
um, 'cause I thought you guys

04:35.522 --> 04:36.822
were gonna hang out with us.

04:36.889 --> 04:38.624
Oh, Angie,

04:38.692 --> 04:39.958
this is my boss's cabin.

04:41.361 --> 04:42.894
Oh! This is it!

04:42.962 --> 04:44.796
Where were these
when we were having sex?

04:44.863 --> 04:47.064
That's how I feel. What?

04:47.132 --> 04:48.452
- Let's go shoot things.
- Yeah.

04:48.453 --> 04:50.234
- Okay.
- Not scared.

04:50.302 --> 04:53.137
- Just be careful, please.
- Good, yep.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.339
Yeah!

04:54.406 --> 04:55.973
All right, well...

04:56.441 --> 04:58.321
- That's all right.
- Sam, are you having fun?

04:58.322 --> 05:00.510
'Cause I really, really
want you to have fun.

05:00.578 --> 05:02.258
- Course I am. I'm here with you.
- Good.

05:02.326 --> 05:03.366
- You know?
- Okay, good.

05:03.367 --> 05:04.147
Drink hot cocoa.

05:04.215 --> 05:05.215
It's not much fun

05:05.282 --> 05:06.403
without someone firing back.

05:07.151 --> 05:09.118
You're amazing!

05:09.186 --> 05:10.821
Wow!

05:10.888 --> 05:12.389
That is not safe.

05:12.457 --> 05:15.491
That is really reckless.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.728
You want to shoot guns, don't you?

05:20.530 --> 05:22.264
Go on.

05:22.832 --> 05:24.266
Guys, guys!
Save a bullet!

05:28.137 --> 05:29.572
Could be a little bit closer.

05:33.342 --> 05:34.876
Got to be kidding me.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.010
How do you keep missing?

05:37.078 --> 05:38.179
Come on!

05:38.247 --> 05:39.347
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

05:39.415 --> 05:41.383
- Hey.
- No gun safety for us, right?

05:41.450 --> 05:43.105
- Want to shoot?
- No, no, no, do not

05:43.106 --> 05:45.426
give her a gun. She cannot
handle having a gun, trust me.

05:45.454 --> 05:48.321
All right, you know what,
yeah, give me the boom stick.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.790
The what? It's not called a boom stick.
It's a rifle. So...

05:50.791 --> 05:51.751
What? Give me the rifle.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.292
Oh, right.

05:53.695 --> 05:56.229
Whoa, yeah, you know what?

05:56.297 --> 05:57.898
I feel powerful.

05:57.965 --> 05:59.199
Whoa! Come on now!

05:59.267 --> 06:00.534
Come on! Hey!

06:00.602 --> 06:01.668
Okay, all right.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.016
- Nobody better...
- Hey! Jess!

06:03.037 --> 06:04.036
- Hey!
- Jess, thanks.

06:04.104 --> 06:05.638
Are you nuts?

06:05.706 --> 06:07.306
- Here, all right, see that can?
- Yep.

06:07.374 --> 06:09.214
- All right.
- But I need like, a back story.

06:09.215 --> 06:10.676
Like, why am I mad at the can?

06:10.744 --> 06:13.546
That can is your
ex-boyfriend, and, uh,

06:13.614 --> 06:16.215
he did not respect your space

06:16.283 --> 06:19.091
and, um, thought that
your arts and crafts

06:19.092 --> 06:21.052
- section of your house was ridiculous.
- What??

06:21.120 --> 06:22.960
- And, right, done? Enough?
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

06:23.022 --> 06:24.323
Yeah.

06:24.324 --> 06:26.004
Let me just square
your hips right there.

06:26.005 --> 06:27.071
All right,

06:27.072 --> 06:28.192
center your... there you go.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.028
Now let me just move your hair.

06:30.095 --> 06:32.196
- It's so pretty, really curly.
- Thanks.

06:32.264 --> 06:33.732
Fantasy and nightmare colliding.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.633
Take a deep breath.

06:40.037 --> 06:41.104
Congrats.

06:41.172 --> 06:42.239
We have no power.

06:42.307 --> 06:43.340
Uh...

06:43.408 --> 06:44.975
I'm just gonna...

06:45.043 --> 06:46.803
Whoa! Jess, that's it.
Let go of the rifle.

06:46.858 --> 06:48.338
I mean it; You're done.
You're done.

06:50.011 --> 06:51.211
Jess, I'm having a great time.

06:51.321 --> 06:52.841
Oh, yeah, I'm so mad at you right now.

06:52.909 --> 06:55.109
Guys, I think that this
just turned into an adventure.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.750
Look what I found
in the owner's closet.

06:56.751 --> 06:57.318
Yes!

06:57.386 --> 06:58.553
Thank you so much.

06:58.620 --> 06:59.980
- You rule.
- This is good stuff.

06:59.981 --> 07:01.781
See, making the best
of the night. Sweaters.

07:01.790 --> 07:03.658
A little mothy.

07:03.726 --> 07:05.566
Look what else I found
in the owner's closet.

07:05.567 --> 07:05.767
What?

07:06.627 --> 07:07.828
Crème de menthe, guys.

07:08.646 --> 07:09.779
Oh, get in here, girl.

07:09.847 --> 07:10.847
Oh, body warmth.

07:10.915 --> 07:12.482
Take a pull.

07:12.549 --> 07:14.417
- Ooh, yeah.
- pass her over.

07:14.485 --> 07:16.086
- Ooh, that's...
- Yeah.

07:16.153 --> 07:17.553
That is not crème de menthe.

07:17.622 --> 07:19.923
That is, uh, the green fairy
right there.

07:19.991 --> 07:20.690
It's absinthe.

07:20.758 --> 07:21.924
Yeah, it's absinthe.

07:21.992 --> 07:23.126
Absinthe?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.160
- Absinthe...
- Nice.

07:24.228 --> 07:26.095
Has killed so many

07:26.163 --> 07:27.497
of our most famous painters.

07:27.564 --> 07:28.764
Last time I tried absinthe,

07:28.832 --> 07:30.533
I tried to put my car in my pocket.

07:30.601 --> 07:32.268
Come on.

07:32.336 --> 07:34.337
Let's get crazy.

07:34.404 --> 07:35.505
Come on, babe.

07:37.107 --> 07:38.940
Yeah.

07:39.008 --> 07:40.208
Okay, yeah, yeah.

07:40.276 --> 07:41.276
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:41.344 --> 07:43.612
Perfect weekend!

07:45.080 --> 07:46.080
- No, no!
- No!

07:46.149 --> 07:47.882
Whoa, too much.

07:47.950 --> 07:49.017
Oh, guys.

07:49.084 --> 07:51.453
I don't feel anything.

07:51.521 --> 07:52.721
<i>Well, those were just the best</i>

07:52.722 --> 07:54.321
ribs that I've ever had.

07:54.389 --> 07:56.524
Ooh, you ain't lying, child.

07:56.591 --> 07:57.991
Thanks for dinner, Schmidt.

07:58.034 --> 07:59.554
You know, I really appreciate it, man.

07:59.555 --> 08:01.195
- I do feel supported.
- So what's next?

08:01.263 --> 08:02.703
There is this one thing that I miss.

08:02.704 --> 08:04.131
I probably shouldn't say, man.

08:04.199 --> 08:05.332
- I can't.
- No, come on.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.467
It's us, man.

08:08.702 --> 08:11.404
Schmidt, I could really go
for some crack.

08:11.472 --> 08:12.905
What?

08:14.308 --> 08:15.208
Crack cocaine?

08:15.276 --> 08:17.143
I remember when I was a kid,

08:17.211 --> 08:18.478
me, my mom,

08:18.546 --> 08:20.580
and her mom, and well, her mom,

08:20.648 --> 08:23.149
and then her mom,
and then of course her mom,

08:23.217 --> 08:24.617
and then my little cousin, Peanut,

08:24.685 --> 08:26.952
they'd all rush back
to that flaming trash can

08:27.020 --> 08:29.021
where we'd sit around and harmonize

08:29.089 --> 08:31.356
and just... ♪ shoo-op. ♪

08:31.424 --> 08:32.664
One of those nights I remember,

08:32.664 --> 08:33.793
well, we ran out of crack.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.587
I'd grab my scarf,
and I would run on down

08:35.589 --> 08:37.429
to the liquor store
where the thugs hang out,

08:37.496 --> 08:40.232
and I would try to get
a good deal on some crack.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.900
Whoo! They never would give me
a good price, man,

08:42.967 --> 08:45.804
but, uh, I tell you what,

08:45.871 --> 08:49.174
there's nothing like the...
the feel of a fire,

08:49.241 --> 08:51.375
a fresh-baked cookie,

08:51.443 --> 08:54.776
and that sweet, sweet taste
of crack in your lungs.

08:57.516 --> 08:59.083
Okay.

08:59.150 --> 09:00.483
Okay, Winston, yeah.

09:00.551 --> 09:03.153
Sure, I mean, if...

09:03.221 --> 09:06.554
If that is something
that you want to do...

09:07.425 --> 09:08.865
See, I knew you were gonna judge me.

09:08.866 --> 09:09.459
I knew it.

09:09.527 --> 09:10.994
No, Winston.

09:11.062 --> 09:13.396
I knew you were gonna judge me
and just...

09:14.664 --> 09:15.998
Winston, listen to me.

09:16.066 --> 09:17.600
Look...

09:17.701 --> 09:19.568
if crack cocaine is what you want

09:19.636 --> 09:22.004
then crack cocaine is what
we are going to get.

09:22.072 --> 09:24.073
How do we do this?

09:24.141 --> 09:26.421
Here's what we do, Schmidt.
We go to the projects, okay?

09:26.422 --> 09:27.844
We knock on some doors.

09:27.911 --> 09:29.391
I'll wait in the car and take lookout

09:29.392 --> 09:30.812
while you do all the legwork.

09:30.913 --> 09:33.348
Because as you say, you are
in much better shape than I am.

09:33.415 --> 09:34.783
You do have the body of a Smurf.

09:34.851 --> 09:36.651
We could... We could just
get frozen yogurt.

09:36.652 --> 09:37.953
It's not a big deal.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.500
Schmidt isn't about no frozen yogurt.

09:39.501 --> 09:41.923
I want to go score some crack cocaine.

09:41.991 --> 09:43.291
Really?

09:43.359 --> 09:44.525
We're gonna do this.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

09:54.169 --> 09:56.503
Look at them.
This is a cabin, guys.

09:56.571 --> 09:58.531
Getting wasted on a couple
of shots of absinthe.

09:58.532 --> 09:59.540
Word games, word games,

09:59.541 --> 10:00.941
word games, word games, word games.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.743
Doctor! I was saying...

10:06.046 --> 10:07.981
I don't think I feel it.

10:08.048 --> 10:09.549
I can't believe I'm the sober one.

10:09.617 --> 10:12.452
That's actually never
happened in my life.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.887
Who wants to play Charades?

10:13.954 --> 10:15.589
Me.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.056
One syllable, one syllable.

10:17.124 --> 10:18.791
Movie.

10:18.858 --> 10:19.892
<i>Gattaca.</i>

10:19.959 --> 10:22.027
Oh, I want to be them.

10:22.095 --> 10:23.663
I have to run upstairs for a sec.

10:23.730 --> 10:26.098
I have it on good authority
my bed has disappeared.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.301
I need to go check it out.

10:30.136 --> 10:32.438
I got to head up there
and take care of that.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.872
Oh, you-you're gonna
go upstairs?

10:34.940 --> 10:37.008
- Yeah, yeah.
- Now?

10:37.075 --> 10:37.942
Yeah.

10:38.010 --> 10:40.144
Oh, ho-ho-ho, yeah.

10:40.712 --> 10:42.113
Okay.

10:42.181 --> 10:43.281
Have fun.

10:43.349 --> 10:44.316
I will, I guess.

10:48.553 --> 10:50.387
Up.

10:51.690 --> 10:53.056
Doesn't sound good.

10:53.124 --> 10:55.359
Oh, Jess.

10:55.427 --> 10:57.361
- That sounded terrible.
- The absinthe

10:57.429 --> 10:58.796
has found a new host.

10:59.363 --> 11:00.531
The toilet.

11:00.598 --> 11:01.198
Oh...

11:01.265 --> 11:03.667
I like Angie.

11:03.735 --> 11:05.902
She's cool.
It's kind of like

11:05.970 --> 11:08.003
riding a poorly maintained
carnival ride.

11:08.071 --> 11:09.872
I'm glad you get it.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.374
I think she really likes you.

11:13.076 --> 11:15.545
All right.

11:15.612 --> 11:17.279
Jeth... I'm not...
I'm-I'm with Jeth.

11:17.348 --> 11:18.314
Hey, Nick,

11:18.382 --> 11:19.982
look, we switched.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.218
And look...
middle of the night...

11:23.762 --> 11:25.795
What is the big deal?

11:25.863 --> 11:29.532
I... why else did we all
go to a cabin together?

11:29.599 --> 11:31.166
To hike?

11:31.234 --> 11:33.101
Guys, I'm still really feeling it.

11:33.169 --> 11:34.970
I just can't believe
you'd do that to Nick.

11:35.038 --> 11:36.672
She didn't do anything to me.

11:36.740 --> 11:37.900
We have an open relationship.

11:37.901 --> 11:38.774
She can do whatever

11:38.842 --> 11:39.875
she wants.
I don't care.

11:39.943 --> 11:41.544
Enough. I'm tired of you

11:41.611 --> 11:43.478
acting like this cool guy

11:43.547 --> 11:45.479
with an "open relationship."

11:45.548 --> 11:46.748
That is not you.

11:46.815 --> 11:48.215
Yes, it is, Jess.

11:48.283 --> 11:50.484
Why won't you just
let me be me? This is me!

11:50.553 --> 11:52.219
I'm sorry.
I just don't believe you.

11:52.287 --> 11:53.688
You're not this guy.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.723
No, no, no, I'm not feeling good...

11:55.791 --> 11:57.911
At least we don't pretend
to be this perfect couple.

11:57.912 --> 12:00.261
I do not pretend
to be a perfect couple.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.728
The only reason that we're here

12:01.756 --> 12:02.996
is 'cause you asked us to come,

12:02.997 --> 12:03.931
'cause you didn't want

12:03.998 --> 12:05.832
to be alone with Dr. Sam.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.660
'Cause then you'd
have to be real with him.

12:07.661 --> 12:09.202
Jess? Is that true?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.404
Yes, but no...
it's out of context.

12:11.472 --> 12:12.839
It's out of context, Nick.

12:12.907 --> 12:14.975
You think you know everything about me.

12:15.043 --> 12:17.209
- I'm a rock and roll guy.
- You are the guy

12:17.277 --> 12:19.178
who asks me to light matches for you

12:19.245 --> 12:21.681
'cause you're afraid your
fingers are gonna get too hot.

12:21.748 --> 12:23.388
- I did that one time.
- Multiple times.

12:23.389 --> 12:25.284
I was on the back of
a motorcycle earlier,

12:25.351 --> 12:27.019
and I wasn't even that scared.

12:27.087 --> 12:28.754
- You don't think I'm crazy?
- No.

12:28.822 --> 12:30.923
Would a sane man do this?

12:30.991 --> 12:32.924
Oh!

12:32.992 --> 12:35.760
Oh!

12:35.828 --> 12:37.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

12:37.429 --> 12:39.149
You're doing it.
You're doing a lot of it.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.857
You need to just pace
it a little bit...

12:40.858 --> 12:41.733
Oh, whoa, that...

12:41.801 --> 12:43.001
you're really doing it.

12:43.069 --> 12:44.268
Whoa!

12:51.741 --> 12:52.398
Well?

12:52.399 --> 12:55.119
I suppose we could just get out and
ask any of these street youths.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.520
I'll let you get out the car first.

12:56.521 --> 12:57.681
Go ahead, do your thing, man.

12:57.749 --> 12:59.189
I don't want to ask the wrong person

12:59.190 --> 13:00.630
and end up with
some sub-par crack.

13:00.631 --> 13:01.952
I want the fresh crack, you know?

13:02.020 --> 13:04.687
Not some crack that's been
laying around all day.

13:05.455 --> 13:07.843
Ooh... I'm really
starting to schvitz.

13:07.844 --> 13:09.644
We don't have to do this.
Man, we could just

13:09.645 --> 13:11.605
turn this car around,
forget this ever happened,

13:11.606 --> 13:12.846
and get you some frozen yogurt.

13:12.914 --> 13:14.834
I will not let you deny
who you are any longer.

13:14.835 --> 13:15.475
Not on my watch.

13:16.565 --> 13:18.100
- Schmidt...
- Hey, psst!

13:18.167 --> 13:20.401
- Schmidt, no.
- Yes. Skee-you!

13:20.469 --> 13:21.937
- Skee-you!
- Schmidt!

13:22.005 --> 13:23.171
You, dude.

13:23.239 --> 13:24.519
Don't call that man to this car.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.680
Hi, how are you this evening?

13:26.108 --> 13:27.307
What do you guys need?

13:27.375 --> 13:28.815
It's cool, just get in the car, man.

13:28.816 --> 13:30.136
- What cool?
- Yeah, we're cool.

13:30.137 --> 13:32.137
Schmidt, you did not invite
this guy in this car.

13:32.138 --> 13:33.578
He could be crazy, could have a gun.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.579
That's a racist thing to
say, Winston, that he...

13:35.580 --> 13:36.340
Stop it, Schmidt...

13:36.378 --> 13:38.058
Just assuming that
this man has a pistol.

13:38.059 --> 13:38.385
Hi, sir.

13:38.453 --> 13:39.754
How are you this evening?

13:39.821 --> 13:43.154
Um, the two of us are very interested

13:43.217 --> 13:44.537
in purchasing some crack cocaine.

13:44.558 --> 13:45.925
You guys cops?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.113
- What?
- Okay, let me out.

13:47.114 --> 13:49.274
Schmidt, Schmidt... I was
just messing with you, man.

13:49.275 --> 13:50.515
Okay? I was just
trying to see

13:50.516 --> 13:52.436
how far your stupid white
guilt would take you.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.749
Have you ever done crack?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.230
Hell, no, I've never done crack, man.

13:55.231 --> 13:56.936
Why do you think I've done
crack? Because I'm black?

13:56.978 --> 13:58.538
I thought you'd done crack
'cause you told me

13:58.539 --> 14:00.247
- the whole story about you doing crack.
- I though you guys

14:00.248 --> 14:01.408
just needed directions, okay?

14:01.409 --> 14:02.489
- Let me out!
- Okay, sir,

14:02.490 --> 14:04.410
- just calm down, all right?
- Oh, please, man.

14:04.411 --> 14:04.731
Be cool.

14:04.732 --> 14:06.361
Fine, okay, look, you want it?
You want it? Look!

14:06.362 --> 14:07.241
- Whoa! No!
- Oh my God, no!

14:07.242 --> 14:08.247
- Look, my wallet.
- No! No!

14:08.248 --> 14:09.848
Take my wallet!
Here's my wallet, okay?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.489
Shoot the white dude!
Just let me out...

14:11.490 --> 14:12.690
Shoot him! No, don't shoot me!

14:12.691 --> 14:14.159
Shoot him, man!
But that's...

14:14.160 --> 14:15.920
- That's your wallet.
- That's <i>your</i> wallet.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.961
- Are you not robbing us?
- You're not robbing me?

14:17.962 --> 14:19.844
- I don't want to rob you, man.
- I thought you were gonna...

14:19.845 --> 14:21.125
I totally misread the situation.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.829
- I thought you was robbing me.
- Oh, no, man.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.430
- Oh, hey, man, I'm Schmidt.
- Robert, man.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.757
- Robert. Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure, man.

14:25.758 --> 14:27.598
Robert, man, hey, man,
nice to meet you, man.

14:27.599 --> 14:29.319
What a nice smile he has.
All right, guys.

14:29.320 --> 14:29.633
I'm just...

14:29.634 --> 14:31.434
Okay. Here, I'll...
they're the child locks.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.468
- I don't even have kids, but...
- You guys have a great night, okay?

14:33.469 --> 14:35.179
- You, too, man. Be safe.
- Take care, Robert.

14:35.180 --> 14:35.900
Take it easy, man.

14:35.901 --> 14:37.661
You guys have a good
night, man, all right.

14:37.662 --> 14:38.302
That was insane.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.210
- I was terrified. That...
- Oh, my goodness.

14:40.211 --> 14:41.578
I judged...

14:41.645 --> 14:43.313
- God, Robert!
- Robert...

14:43.380 --> 14:44.781
I just...
the wallet?

14:44.782 --> 14:46.382
- Oh, your wallet...
- Oh, your wallet.

14:46.383 --> 14:48.303
- Just give him the wallet.
- I'm really sorry.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.804
- Yeah, it's kind of...
- No, yeah, I get it.

14:49.805 --> 14:50.965
I'd want my wallet back, too.

14:50.966 --> 14:52.582
- Thank you.
- All right. Thanks, Robert.

14:52.583 --> 14:54.063
- I wouldn't thank him.
- Whoa, man.

14:54.064 --> 14:55.424
What a hilarious misunderstanding.

14:55.425 --> 14:57.465
- Schmidt, drive the damn car.
- No, you're right.

15:16.378 --> 15:17.979
You know, I feel so much better

15:18.047 --> 15:19.947
after throwing up into the fire.

15:22.851 --> 15:24.818
Uh, Sam, can you pass the bread?

15:24.886 --> 15:27.487
- Oh, sure thing.
- No, I'll pass the bread, Angie.

15:27.555 --> 15:30.115
Just keep your hands to yourself
and let the bread come to you.

15:36.863 --> 15:38.943
- Why do you keep taking my bread?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:39.003 --> 15:41.163
I thought you and the bread
had an open relationship.

15:41.164 --> 15:43.284
I said I was sorry.
I thought this was an agreement.

15:43.336 --> 15:45.296
I thought we were all cool
with this. I don't...

15:45.338 --> 15:47.539
Absinthe!

15:48.997 --> 15:50.742
Fun dinner.
Fun dinner.

15:50.810 --> 15:52.644
I always have fun at the cabin.

15:52.711 --> 15:54.005
You guys want to pick my brain?

15:54.013 --> 15:55.893
You guys want to know
what I'm thinking about?

15:55.894 --> 15:57.348
I like dogs more than cats.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.917
I like chipmunks more than squirrels.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.654
I believe in UFOs.

16:02.721 --> 16:04.455
I once had a bass teacher,

16:04.477 --> 16:06.357
when I was younger,
who did the standing bass.

16:06.425 --> 16:09.093
And he had a very weird smell,
and I still think about it.

16:09.161 --> 16:11.361
His name was Mr. Hilton.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.898
I don't like the fact that
you tried to kiss Sam.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.868
Because I have feelings for you, Angie.

16:19.671 --> 16:23.004
I'm... I had no idea, I'm sorry.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.374
I know.
We said it was open, but...

16:27.011 --> 16:28.544
I'm proud of you for saying that.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.880
Dr. Sam?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.468
If you were a hat, you'd be a top hat.

16:34.185 --> 16:36.452
But like a really big Monopoly one.

16:37.020 --> 16:39.853
And I say that
of the deepest compliments.

16:40.489 --> 16:41.223
Appreciate it.

16:42.638 --> 16:44.704
Winston, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.252
What, help me realize that I'm black?

16:46.253 --> 16:47.533
Schmidt, believe it or not, man,

16:47.534 --> 16:48.814
I've known that for a while now.

16:48.815 --> 16:51.335
I just feel bad you're forced
to live here with Jess and Nick.

16:51.336 --> 16:53.096
- Oh, wow.
- I mean, they're honky as hell.

16:53.164 --> 16:55.684
And look at our people. Look what
we've given to this country.

16:55.685 --> 16:56.450
Jazz...

16:56.517 --> 16:58.251
The management of jazz musicians.

16:58.319 --> 17:00.786
But, look, Schmidt, being black means

17:00.854 --> 17:02.421
whatever I want it to mean.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.889
You know, the fact of the matter is

17:03.890 --> 17:05.557
I live in a loft with three people

17:05.625 --> 17:07.193
who happen to be white.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.461
But believe you me,

17:08.528 --> 17:09.728
there is so much more

17:09.796 --> 17:11.130
that I find annoying about you

17:11.198 --> 17:13.465
that I haven't even gotten to race.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.267
Now, I'm gonna get some frozen yogurt.

17:15.585 --> 17:17.267
Would you like anything?

17:17.385 --> 17:18.369
Yeah.

17:18.936 --> 17:20.570
I'll have a vanilla chocolate swirl.

17:20.638 --> 17:22.507
- No.
- What, no...

17:22.574 --> 17:25.776
No. I'll have
strawberry with jimmies.

17:26.344 --> 17:27.645
Did you get that?

17:29.981 --> 17:31.048
Hey.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.182
How you doing?

17:33.818 --> 17:35.952
Much better.

17:37.021 --> 17:39.056
That alcohol got on top of me.

17:39.624 --> 17:41.224
Oh... I'm a little
embarrassed by that.

17:41.225 --> 17:43.527
I'm sorry about Sam.

17:43.594 --> 17:45.629
I... I thought it was cool.

17:45.696 --> 17:48.064
- Right.
- And I try to ruin things as soon as

17:48.132 --> 17:49.431
they get good.

17:49.499 --> 17:51.099
I'm working on it.

17:51.167 --> 17:54.003
Believe it or not,
I'm working on stuff, too.

17:54.070 --> 17:56.872
You know, I just wish I was
working on less stuff.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.774
You know, I've been arrested
three times.

17:58.842 --> 18:00.009
Four times.

18:00.076 --> 18:01.276
Four to five times.

18:01.344 --> 18:03.311
I have tattoos

18:03.379 --> 18:05.079
of bands that I don't
even like anymore.

18:05.147 --> 18:06.547
By the way, you've been really cool

18:06.548 --> 18:08.228
about the "Jamiroquai"
tattoo on my butt.

18:08.229 --> 18:10.018
I'm not asking you to change.

18:10.085 --> 18:13.254
Just how about meet me
in the middle a little bit?

18:13.321 --> 18:15.823
What do you want me to do?
Go to brunch?

18:15.891 --> 18:17.451
Are we supposed to, like, read articles

18:17.452 --> 18:18.812
and then talk about them together?

18:18.813 --> 18:19.694
Okay, I'm never

18:19.762 --> 18:20.962
going to be that kind of girl.

18:21.029 --> 18:22.829
I just want to do something normal.

18:22.897 --> 18:24.031
How about not

18:24.098 --> 18:26.466
drawing pubes on my armpit

18:26.534 --> 18:28.001
while I'm sleeping?

18:28.069 --> 18:28.829
You think you could

18:28.870 --> 18:30.003
do something like that?

18:30.071 --> 18:32.839
Yeah. Yeah.

18:32.907 --> 18:34.541
'Cause I would really like

18:34.609 --> 18:36.742
to keep this going.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.344
Want to move your twin bed over here?

18:39.412 --> 18:41.313
Sexy, sexy, sexy.

18:42.849 --> 18:44.283
Bird! Bird! Bird!

18:44.350 --> 18:45.585
- Bird!
- Oh.

18:45.652 --> 18:46.986
- Help! Help!
- Oh, my God.

18:47.054 --> 18:48.614
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

18:48.615 --> 18:49.922
No big, I got it!
I'm on it.

18:49.990 --> 18:51.991
Just a...
it was a painting.

18:52.008 --> 18:54.810
That's not really how
I wanted the weekend to go.

18:54.877 --> 18:56.645
I thought the worst
thing that could happen

18:56.713 --> 18:59.247
was someone wouldn't like
the cheese I brought.

19:00.383 --> 19:02.250
I wanted it to be perfect.

19:02.318 --> 19:04.820
Jess, when Nick said
that you invited them

19:04.887 --> 19:06.455
because you were nervous...

19:06.522 --> 19:08.922
- No, don't worry about that.
- Jess,

19:08.990 --> 19:11.291
we're not perfect.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.093
Like the first time we slept together,

19:13.161 --> 19:14.928
like, I didn't even
know your real name.

19:14.996 --> 19:16.564
Kind of a pretty sassy detail.

19:16.631 --> 19:19.933
Can we just concentrate
on the fact that, like,

19:20.001 --> 19:22.970
I was tripping pretty hard on absinthe

19:23.037 --> 19:24.371
and I said, "No"?

19:24.438 --> 19:25.972
To a stripper?

19:26.039 --> 19:27.907
I mean, a stripper was
like rubbing my leg...

19:27.975 --> 19:29.709
That's weirdly...

19:29.777 --> 19:32.111
the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

19:52.698 --> 19:55.040
- Got it.
- I left a Post-it note

19:55.041 --> 19:56.601
on the transformer
that said "Broken."

19:56.668 --> 19:58.428
Is there any way that
we could make it look

19:58.429 --> 20:00.509
- like it was raccoon bites?
- A few announcements.

20:00.510 --> 20:01.439
Uh...

20:01.507 --> 20:03.875
Angie left. Me.

20:03.942 --> 20:06.477
- What?
- She took the motorcycle,

20:06.545 --> 20:08.078
and, uh, a few of my belongings,

20:08.146 --> 20:09.546
but I'm still wearing my underwear,

20:09.547 --> 20:11.627
so she comes up short-handed
in that treasure hunt.

20:11.695 --> 20:13.255
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Nick.

20:13.256 --> 20:13.856
I'm sorry, man.

20:13.857 --> 20:15.051
It's fine; I'm a grown man.

20:15.119 --> 20:16.386
I will need a ride home.

20:16.454 --> 20:17.687
- Yeah.
- Obviously.

20:17.755 --> 20:19.115
I would love to pitch in with gas,

20:19.116 --> 20:21.516
but I don't have any money,
so I could pay in "Nick Bucks,"

20:21.517 --> 20:22.426
fully redeemable

20:22.493 --> 20:24.127
for smiles

20:24.194 --> 20:25.962
and any one item from my bureau.

20:26.030 --> 20:27.196
We'll hold you to that.

20:27.264 --> 20:28.597
Thank you, Doctor.

20:30.165 --> 20:31.062
Don't, I-I'm good.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.743
- I know you don't want to be hugged.
- I don't want to be hugged.

20:33.744 --> 20:35.864
- And I respect that. So...
- Okay. 'Cause I'm fine.

20:35.865 --> 20:37.025
Jess, no, I'm good, I'm good.

20:37.026 --> 20:38.306
I promise you, I'm good. Just...

20:38.373 --> 20:39.813
Actually, this is very weird for me.

20:39.814 --> 20:41.208
- I'm not hugging you.
- I know.

20:41.276 --> 20:44.111
- I'm sorry.
- I promise you I'm okay.

20:44.179 --> 20:46.059
Stop making this a thing,
because I'm not sad.

20:46.081 --> 20:48.450
- This is for the best.
- Yeah.

20:48.517 --> 20:50.084
- I'm fine.
- She didn't deserve you.

20:51.253 --> 20:53.353
Whatever that means.

20:53.421 --> 20:54.821
- Thank you.
- Okay, almost there.

20:54.856 --> 20:56.256
- Hey, let's go!
- All right.

20:56.824 --> 20:58.091
Hey, the potato salad's

20:58.159 --> 20:59.326
accidentally in the garbage.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.394
Look at that.

21:01.462 --> 21:03.330
You guys mind if I eat
this in the back seat?

21:03.397 --> 21:05.298
You can eat salad
in my back seat anytime.

21:07.884 --> 21:09.234
Didn't mean that to be sexual.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.770
All right, guys.

21:10.838 --> 21:12.071
It's a little bit gamey.

21:13.038 --> 21:13.806
Okay.

21:13.874 --> 21:15.040
I'll get the garbage, here.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.909
Hold on, hold on.

21:16.977 --> 21:18.243
The absinthe.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.245
You almost screwed that up by accident.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.747
Wow.

21:21.815 --> 21:23.649
We're ready.
You all right?

21:23.717 --> 21:25.037
Yep, I'll be right with you guys.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.420
That was a mistake! Whoo!

21:29.620 --> 21:31.420
I am gonna poop weird tonight!

21:31.489 --> 21:34.489
Yeah...
Oooh, that was a mistake.
