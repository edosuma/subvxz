WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:05.504
- Ruth, this thing weighs a ton.
- A large energy crystal

00:05.639 --> 00:07.506
can pack a very
powerful punch, Rollie.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.442
I guess it's true what they say,
"Size does matter."

00:10.444 --> 00:13.578
- (Mark): Oh, my God!
Oh, my goodness!

00:13.647 --> 00:16.048
- Dad, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?!

00:16.050 --> 00:18.450
Oh, I'm just playing
a quick game of tennis

00:18.486 --> 00:20.385
with Venus Williams here.
Alright, Venus?

00:20.421 --> 00:23.055
- I don't understand the joke.
- Dr. Green said you shouldn't

00:23.057 --> 00:25.124
be doing any strenuous activity.
Put that down!

00:25.259 --> 00:28.126
- I cannot just put this down
anywhere. A poorly
placed crystal

00:28.162 --> 00:29.995
is a...
What is it, Ruth?

00:29.997 --> 00:31.597
- Weapon in the hands
of the universe.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.265
- It's a weapon in the hands
of the universe!

00:33.334 --> 00:34.967
- Dad, don't tell me
you're falling for that crap.

00:35.102 --> 00:38.136
- It's not crap, Andy.
A lot of very cool celebs
are into crystals:

00:38.205 --> 00:40.805
Spencer Pratt from<i> The Hills,</i>
Heidi Pratt from<i> The Hills.</i>

00:40.841 --> 00:42.741
And that's just two of the cast
members from<i> The Hills.</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:45.144
- You know what, Dad?
- I'm fine, Andy!

00:45.146 --> 00:48.046
- Let me take it, Dad.
- Let him do it, Andy, please.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.915
(Rollie breathing fast)
Dad? Dad?

00:50.951 --> 00:53.685
- (Ruth): Rollie?
- Is this a prank?
Are you guys pranking me?

00:53.821 --> 00:55.153
- It's not a prank, Andy. Daddy,
are you having a heart attack?

00:55.189 --> 00:57.489
- Of course, I'm having
a heart attack, you massive tit!

00:57.525 --> 01:00.225
- Oh, God, he's mad at me,
something's wrong. He's mad
at me, something's wrong!

01:00.360 --> 01:02.294
- OK, I'm gonna
call an ambulance.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.295
I wish I had
some rose quartz or aventurine.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.698
Oh! Peridot,
that would be perfect!

01:06.700 --> 01:09.101
- Ruth!
- Yeah, going.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.004
- ♪ Di-da di-da di-da
di-da di-da di-da ♪

01:16.043 --> 01:18.143
(machine beeping)

01:18.278 --> 01:20.111
- OK, so it appears

01:20.147 --> 01:21.779
your father suffered
another heart attack.

01:21.816 --> 01:24.383
Now, that's eight
in the past twelve months,

01:24.518 --> 01:26.251
which actually is one away
from the provincial record.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.120
So I could get him there
if you want.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.455
- Eight heart attacks in a year?
How is he still alive?

01:30.524 --> 01:34.259
- Ha! Quit grilling me.
But seriously, I have no idea.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.595
- OK, alright, so what is
the plan here?

01:36.664 --> 01:38.597
Obviously, we have to make
some changes, right?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.799
- Don't worry. I've consulted
my crystal manual

01:40.801 --> 01:42.734
and let's just say
we'll be seeing

01:42.803 --> 01:44.736
a lot more red jasper
around the house.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.739
- Ruth, Dad needs
some actual medical attention.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.342
Maybe a home-care worker,
right, Dr. Green?

01:50.411 --> 01:52.811
- A home-care worker
could help, but...

01:52.880 --> 01:55.681
- But what?
- Red jasper is a great stone.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.016
- Isn't it though?
- I honestly love that stuff.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.851
- Really soothes.
- Exactly what I said to her.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.553
- You were saying that.
- Oh. OK, yeah.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.490
-<i> You guys, come on,</i>
<i> let's get this place cleaned.</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:06.691
June is gonna be here
any minute.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.627
Bryn, Mark, you wanna help?

02:08.696 --> 02:11.663
- No, thank you.
- Yeah, we're not gonna do
that. We're gonna keep working

02:11.699 --> 02:13.231
on Bryn's graphic novel
which is called...?

02:13.267 --> 02:16.034
-<i> Wolf Daniel.</i>
-<i> Wolf Daniel.</i>

02:16.103 --> 02:18.337
Look at that guy,
he's freaking jacked, eh?

02:18.339 --> 02:21.073
- (sighing): Great.
- Andy, this is

02:21.075 --> 02:24.209
a complete waste of time.
I do not need some nurse maid

02:24.245 --> 02:27.078
hovering about
waiting to change my diaper.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.581
I've got Ruthie for that.
(sniggering)

02:29.716 --> 02:32.184
- He doesn't wear a diaper.
- Dad, give her a chance.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.852
Maybe she'll save you from
breaking the provincial
heart-attack record.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.922
- Yeah, well, what if I want
that record, huh?

02:36.924 --> 02:40.058
Records are nice.
People are known for records.
(doorbell ringing)

02:40.127 --> 02:42.027
- Oh, my God, that's her,
that's her! OK, everyone,

02:42.162 --> 02:45.297
just act normal. Bryn, you...

02:45.299 --> 02:48.367
You're good.
Alright. OK, OK.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.938
You must be June.
- And you must be Andy.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.073
You're even more handsome
than you sounded on the phone!

02:55.142 --> 02:58.277
- Thank you.
- And you have got to be Rollie.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.280
I sure know
where Andy gets his looks.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.815
- Well, don't pin those on me.
- And witty to boot.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.084
I best be on guard
around you.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.219
(June laughing)
(Rollie chuckling nervously)

03:08.255 --> 03:11.690
No, actually, there has been
a bit of a misunderstanding.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.559
I'm sorry to waste your time,
but it turns out

03:14.562 --> 03:16.494
I don't need a babysitter.

03:16.564 --> 03:20.298
- Dad! I'm sorry.
- No, that's OK. It's OK, Andy.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.635
Uh, sometimes,
people recover

03:23.671 --> 03:26.705
a little faster than expected.
No worries,

03:26.774 --> 03:30.174
I'll just take my Assyrian
sculpture and just get on

03:30.211 --> 03:32.177
out of here. Bye-bye.
(Rollie mumbling)

03:32.246 --> 03:34.512
- Sorry, what did you say
you've got there?

03:34.582 --> 03:38.350
- Oh, it's an Assyrian
relief sculpture of an alien.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.386
I mean, it's most certainly
not authentic, but still.

03:41.521 --> 03:43.655
- Oh, well, it might not be
the real deal,

03:43.724 --> 03:45.924
but it's certainly very tasty.
- Isn't it?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.993
- Wow! Where did you get it?

03:47.995 --> 03:50.462
- My late husband ran
a museum of his own

03:50.531 --> 03:53.265
before he passed away.
This was just in storage.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.466
You can have it

03:55.502 --> 03:57.603
for a price.
- What price?

03:59.139 --> 04:01.607
- I demand a tour
of this wonderful museum.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.675
I am just chomping at the bit

04:03.711 --> 04:05.811
to see what you've got in here.
(June laughing)

04:05.813 --> 04:07.812
- Oh, well, say no more. Hahaha!

04:07.881 --> 04:11.016
Oh, uh, that's Bryn.
And that's Mark.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.552
- (June): Oh, hello!
- And this is, uh...

04:14.655 --> 04:16.288
- It's Ruth.
- Ruth!

04:16.357 --> 04:18.122
I think I blanked there.
That's weird.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.958
I just couldn't think what
her name was for a moment.
Now, it's...

04:20.995 --> 04:22.628
- It's Ruth.
- Ruth, yeah.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.496
- It's very nice to meet you!
- Nice to meet you too.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.299
- Oh, my goodness!
I have the exact same purse.

04:27.301 --> 04:30.135
- Yeah, that's right. Looks like
mine's a slightly newer model.

04:30.204 --> 04:34.605
- Oh, yes, it is.
- Yes... it is.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.575
- OK, well, why don't I
take you on that tour?

04:37.645 --> 04:40.979
- Oh, goodie!
Why don't I take some notes

04:40.981 --> 04:44.115
as to all the unhealthy things
you keep doing during the day.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.451
- Ohhh Well,
be prepared to blush.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.187
(Rollie, June and Ruth laughing)

04:49.256 --> 04:52.524
(Ruth laughing alone)

04:54.428 --> 04:56.728
Oh, it's just a stuffed duck
with a fancy skull

04:56.764 --> 04:59.063
stuck on top of it.
If you call something

04:59.099 --> 05:01.733
an Aztec god, then people
tend to believe you.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.135
That's because
people are idiots.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.137
- Andy, what the hell
are you doing?

05:06.173 --> 05:08.473
- Trying to move this crystal
into the shed. Give me a hand.
- Absolutely not.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.409
No. Didn't you hear
what Ruth said?

05:10.544 --> 05:13.345
A poorly placed crystal is
a weapon in the hands
of the universe.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.347
- Yeah, well, in case
you haven't noticed,

05:15.482 --> 05:18.550
this place is a house of science
now, and Dad seems to
be taking to it.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.685
- Oh yeah, Dad's really
taking to the science.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.422
Couldn't possibly be the
sexy temptress you've
hired to wait on him.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.623
- She's not a sexy temptress;
she's a professional nurse.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.159
- She is a lonely,
widowed professional nurse

05:28.195 --> 05:31.028
who clearly has
the hots for Dad.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.766
- You are delusional, man.
-<i> You</i> are delusional. Do you
think Ruth doesn't notice this?

05:34.901 --> 05:37.702
- We don't even know what Ruth
and Dad's relationship is.

05:37.738 --> 05:41.373
Yes, we do. It's not that
complicated. Ruth and Dad
are like the Odd Couple.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.108
They don't seem to get along
on the surface, but they
got a fun rapport,

05:44.144 --> 05:46.111
they clearly love each other,
and deep down,

05:46.113 --> 05:48.113
you just know
they're f(Bleep)ing.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.515
- How does that apply
to the Odd Couple?

05:50.650 --> 05:53.718
- Oh, trust me, it applies
to the Odd Couple.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.454
- You mean to tell me
the characters

05:55.589 --> 05:57.021
in<i> The Odd Couple</i>
as portrayed

05:57.057 --> 06:00.258
by Walter Matthau and
Jack Lemmon were having sex?

06:00.260 --> 06:02.794
- Yes.
- Well, that's crazy.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.596
- I don't know what you want me
to tell you, Andy. Now help me
get this up. We're moving it.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.666
to where--
- No! You help me...

06:07.668 --> 06:11.002
- OK, we'll move this
to where Ruth wants it.
- No, we are moving it--

06:11.138 --> 06:13.004
- This way, Andy. Not--
- No. This way! This way!

06:13.006 --> 06:14.872
This is really heavy,
Mark. COME ON!

06:14.908 --> 06:17.074
(Thump!)

06:17.111 --> 06:18.810
- Did that fall
on your foot?

06:18.846 --> 06:20.211
- Yes.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.748
- Do you... do you need
help getting it off?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.949
- Oh yeah.
Yeah, please, please.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.752
- Do you promise
to fire June?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.154
- No.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.557
(Mark grunting)

06:32.692 --> 06:34.493
- Well then, uh...

06:34.628 --> 06:36.761
- Don't. Don't.
- I don't know what I can do.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.797
- Mark, don't.
- I don't know what you want.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.032
- Please, Mark. Please.
- I can't. My hands are tied.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.701
- Please!
- My hands are tied.
- (crying): Mark, please.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.971
- I thought you could
use a little tea.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.973
- Oh, thank you, Ruth.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.309
- Oh, is this
some more Wolf Daniel?

06:51.378 --> 06:53.678
- Yeah. Here he is
in a softer moment.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.514
- Yes, he looks
very calm.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.415
(June laughing)
- (Rollie): I know, I know.

06:57.418 --> 07:01.118
- Is June still here? I thought
she was supposed to have
gone home hours ago.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.655
- It's her first day on the job,
she's probably just getting
the lay of the land.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.757
(June and Rollie laughing)
- (June): You see these?

07:05.892 --> 07:08.126
- Yeah, sounds like that's not
the only thing she's
getting the lay of.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.262
- Nice.
- Enjoyed that?
- Yeah.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.864
- I'll go see
if she needs some help.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.133
(June laughing)
(Rollie talking indistinctly)

07:17.538 --> 07:20.138
- (Rollie): I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.
(June laughing)

07:20.207 --> 07:22.740
(Rollie laughing)
- You are just a little stinker,

07:22.810 --> 07:24.876
that's what you are!
- Hi, June!

07:25.011 --> 07:26.878
Are you having a little trouble
with him in there?

07:27.013 --> 07:29.614
- No, not at all.
Just getting some Epsom salts.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.485
- For a bath?
Rollie is more of a shower guy.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.020
- Well, in his current
condition, he really should
be sitting as much as possible.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.956
- That makes so much sense.
You're so smart!

07:38.091 --> 07:39.891
But it's late,
you probably wanna get home

07:39.927 --> 07:42.293
so I can take over now--
- No, no, it's my pleasure.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.229
(tense music)
- It's my pleasure too.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.431
So maybe I'll just
head in and make sure

07:46.566 --> 07:49.301
he's OK.
- He's fine, Ruth.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.503
- OK.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.237
I'm just gonna head in to see--
(Thump!)

07:53.273 --> 07:55.574
- (Rollie): Ohhh!
- Could you please move
and let me do my job?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.842
- (Rollie): Argh!
- What's going on?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.777
- Papa? Papa, are you OK?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.646
- (Andy): Oh, my God!
Dad, are you alright?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.249
- (Rollie): Oh, (Bleep) idiot!
- (Andy): I got him! I got him!

08:04.318 --> 08:06.318
- (Mark): Oh, God! I grabbed...

08:06.453 --> 08:09.387
I grabbed his peter.
Dad, did I grab your peter?

08:09.389 --> 08:12.057
- Everyone, give him space.
- Rollie, are you alright?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.125
- That includes you, Ruth.
- June, I think I can

08:14.161 --> 08:16.127
take care of him--
- Ruth, Ruth,

08:16.129 --> 08:18.596
June is the medical
professional here,

08:18.732 --> 08:21.266
please just let her
do her job, alright?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.935
- Come on now. OK? Careful.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.608
- I touched Dad's peter.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.949
or anything?
- Oh yeah, yeah. Here and there

08:37.951 --> 08:40.485
now and then, turns out.
Between us,

08:40.620 --> 08:42.520
I outbid him
every time.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.955
I would.
- Did you ever.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.691
Your father was
always very competitive.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.294
- Yes, well, I am very
competitive naturally.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.630
I mean, I'm much more
competitive than any
of you lot for a start.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.832
(laughing)
- OK, I'm headed into town.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.635
Anyone care to join me?

08:57.704 --> 09:00.505
- Dad? Ruth's asking
you a question.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.908
- Rollie, I thought you might
want to come and just stretch
your legs a little bit.

09:03.911 --> 09:07.045
- What? Oh, no thanks, Ruth.
Yeah, Junie,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.847
have you ever seen
a baby pig in formaldehyde?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.850
- I'm about to!
- You are. Look at that!

09:12.886 --> 09:15.486
- (Rollie): Hahaha!
- (June): Ewww! Holy!

09:15.522 --> 09:17.122
(Rollie oinking)

09:17.124 --> 09:18.856
- (Rollie, laughing):
The horror!

09:18.858 --> 09:20.658
(indistinct song playing)
- These are the cookies

09:20.727 --> 09:22.660
that I was telling you about.
- Oh yeah.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.529
- Ooh! Summer veggies.
They've got rhubarb in!

09:25.566 --> 09:28.066
- Uh-huh.
So, uh, Ruth, I'm sorry

09:28.068 --> 09:30.868
if this is a very personal
question, but what exactly is

09:30.870 --> 09:32.937
your relationship
with my dad?

09:33.006 --> 09:35.206
(Ruth chuckling)
- Oh, my goodness, well!

09:35.342 --> 09:38.276
It's one of those
hard-to-define things.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.145
Like a tomato, is that a fruit
or is it a vegetable?

09:41.214 --> 09:43.014
- It's a fruit.
- Is it?

09:43.149 --> 09:46.217
Has that been formalized?
Oh, that's nice.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.186
- Yes, that wasn't
a clear example for me.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.155
- Your father and I
go back a long way.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.224
In terms of defining it
as a relationship, no,
we haven't defined it.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.426
Your father is
a tough nut to crack.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.696
- I know all about that,
he drove my mom away. Haha!

09:59.266 --> 10:03.034
Anyway, have you tried
telling him how you feel at all?

10:03.169 --> 10:04.869
- No, not in
so many words, but...

10:06.473 --> 10:09.641
...sometimes instead of a
green pepper, I'll buy
a yellow pepper.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.176
- OK. So I'm not sure
that sends

10:12.245 --> 10:15.046
quite as direct a message
as you might think it does.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.114
- I guess I could go
for a red one next time,

10:17.150 --> 10:20.985
but that seems pretty graphic.
- Yeah. OK, so, uh...

10:21.054 --> 10:22.987
I'm just gonna cut
to the chase here, Ruth.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.857
Do you see what's going on,
at home?
- What?

10:25.992 --> 10:29.594
- June, Ruth.
June is honing in on Dad,

10:29.596 --> 10:32.464
and unless you stand up
and start fighting for your man,

10:32.466 --> 10:34.399
she is gonna snatch him
out from under you.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.468
- I don't want to interfere.
This is about

10:36.470 --> 10:39.937
your father's health,
and June seems... nice.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.873
- She's not nice!

10:41.875 --> 10:43.808
Tell me how you feel, Ruth!
Tell me how

10:43.877 --> 10:45.944
you actually feel
about June.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.914
- She has her imperfections,
but who doesn't?
- Good.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.018
Sure, that's a good
place to start. OK, yeah,
she's got imperfections.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.019
I wanna hear
some of those imperfections.

10:55.088 --> 10:58.423
- I don't... She's... She's...
I sometimes wonder

10:58.425 --> 11:00.425
if she's as generous
as she pretends to be.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.360
- Yeah! Now we're talking, Ruth.
Now, we're speaking

11:02.362 --> 11:04.295
the same language. What else?
- She's... she's...

11:04.364 --> 11:05.563
- She's...?
- She's...

11:05.565 --> 11:07.632
- She's...?
- She's had her eyes on Rollie

11:07.767 --> 11:09.767
since the moment
she SAW HIM!

11:09.803 --> 11:12.803
- That's my (Bleep)
right there. That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.606
- Everything OK over there?
- she's tapping into her anger,

11:14.608 --> 11:16.908
stay the f(Bleep) out of it!
- Okeydokey.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.177
- Ruth, we are gonna go home,
and you are gonna show my dad

11:19.179 --> 11:22.113
that you are someone who
cannot and will not...
- Yeah! I will not!

11:22.149 --> 11:23.915
- ...be taken advantage of.
- That's right.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.352
- And how are you gonna do that?
- I'm gonna cook him
a very nice MEAL!

11:28.922 --> 11:31.856
- OK, that is a start.
And not a bad start.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.793
- YEAH!
(weird laughter)

11:34.928 --> 11:37.595
Yeah. Yeah.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.397
- (Rollie):<i> Well done!</i>
(June laughing)

11:39.532 --> 11:41.533
It's another thing
you're good at.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.936
- What's going on here?
- Oh, come on in, you two!
We're just playing a game.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.938
- (Rollie): Whose go is it now?
- (Andy): Me! Me, me, me!

11:47.073 --> 11:49.274
- Hey! Are you ready?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.342
- (Andy): Yeah.
- Alright. And go!

11:51.344 --> 11:54.678
- Ah! OK, give me some clues.
- Well, alright,

11:54.715 --> 11:56.680
calm down, give us a chance.
- He's tall.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.683
- Michael Jordan!
- Taller than Michael Jordan.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.886
Wait, no. Maybe less tall.
Less tall.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.221
- OK, any other attributes,
Bryn, please.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.190
- Oh! He used to be a wrestler.
- Oh! Uh, uh, Hulk Hogan!

12:06.259 --> 12:08.325
Uh, uh, uh, uh,

12:08.361 --> 12:11.496
Doink. Doink the Clown.
Is it Doink the Clown? Doink the
Clown? Doink? Doink the Clown?

12:11.631 --> 12:14.566
- That's not Doink the Clown.
Who's Doink the Clown?!

12:14.568 --> 12:17.669
- He's taller than Doink.
- Jesus, Bryn! Anything
other than tall! Please!

12:17.804 --> 12:19.670
- Oop, time!
- D'augh!

12:19.740 --> 12:21.473
(June laughing)
"Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson"?!

12:21.608 --> 12:23.774
- Whoa, Doink the Clown
is only 5'10''.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.777
- Oh, Jesus, Bryn.
- Andy's right,

12:25.779 --> 12:27.579
I think we let him down
on that one,

12:27.714 --> 12:29.714
because he was very good.
- Rubbish.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.850
- Wow! Looks like you're all
having nice, fun time playing

12:31.985 --> 12:34.852
a family game.
With June as well

12:34.888 --> 12:36.788
involved in that.
But you can probably

12:36.923 --> 12:38.723
head home now, June,
because Ruth...

12:38.792 --> 12:40.792
- Is going to cook
a very special dinner.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.594
- Ohhh, it's really nice
of you, Ruthie.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.596
But actually,
June's already on it.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.333
- Yepper! I have
a nice, healthy meal

12:48.468 --> 12:50.401
in the oven as we speak.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.337
- Does that qualify
as a nursing duty

12:52.472 --> 12:54.906
or is that just a special perk?
- Just a perk, I suppose.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.808
- Feels like a special perk.
- Hahaha!

12:56.810 --> 12:58.810
- Well, that's great!
I guess tomorrow night,

12:58.879 --> 13:01.079
I'll make a very special dinner
and maybe a little movie.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.948
I noticed Netflix has<i> Rocky IV.</i>
Rollie, that's your favourite.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.618
-<i> Rocky IV!</i>
Oh, what a film that is!

13:06.620 --> 13:09.753
The only film to feature
a boxer who gives

13:09.790 --> 13:11.756
his brother-in-law
a robot that's sort of a wife.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.625
(June laughing)
No, that's true.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.827
It's true, it's true.
But I will have to do all that

13:15.829 --> 13:17.762
some other time, Ruthie,
'cause tomorrow

13:17.831 --> 13:20.765
me and June are popping
across the island to
check out an auction, so...

13:20.834 --> 13:23.535
(ominous music)
Oh.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.871
Everything OK, Ruth?

13:26.873 --> 13:28.706
- I'm sorry.
I don't know why

13:28.775 --> 13:31.009
I did that. I...
I guess it's because

13:31.011 --> 13:32.977
I want to spend time with you,
and you're choosing

13:33.013 --> 13:35.246
to spend time with June,
and my body seems to be

13:35.315 --> 13:37.315
rejecting that.
It's so weird!

13:37.317 --> 13:39.317
- It's very expressive, Ruth.
Dad, Ruth is expressing herself.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.385
- Come with us
if you want.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.389
- Oh, sure. Little third wheel
type of thing, that sounds

13:44.391 --> 13:46.791
like a lot of fun.
- No, it doesn't have
to be that way, Ruth.

13:46.926 --> 13:50.328
- Shut up!
- (Mark): Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.196
- Ruth, June is
a guest in our house.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.731
- Oh, that's funny
because I thought

13:53.867 --> 13:56.134
that guests went home
at a certain point.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.870
- Oh, goddamn!
- I suppose I should go then.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.606
- Uh, no, no, please--
- Yes, June, sit down

14:01.675 --> 14:03.875
and I'll go!
- Oh no, you don't really--

14:04.010 --> 14:05.943
- No, no, no, no, no!
And listen,

14:06.012 --> 14:08.512
if my clothes fit you, why don't
you start wearing those too.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.548
You're coming, Bryn?!
- No.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.017
- OK!

14:13.019 --> 14:14.686
- Ruth, don't...

14:16.689 --> 14:19.157
Well, I hope you're happy, Andy.
You and June just

14:19.292 --> 14:21.926
drove away a wonderful woman.
- Ruth drove herself away.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.627
- Is that what you think?
- Yes.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.630
- Maybe it's because
she's panicking

14:25.632 --> 14:27.632
because she and Dad had
a beautiful little Odd Couple

14:27.634 --> 14:30.635
relationship going, and then you
introduced some new lady into it

14:30.637 --> 14:32.704
and drove 'em apart,
just like in<i> Grumpy Old Men.</i>

14:32.706 --> 14:34.372
- This is not like
<i> Grumpy Old Men!</i>

14:34.441 --> 14:36.573
- Exactly like<i> Grumpy Old Men.</i>
- Have you seen<i> Grumpy Old Men?</i>

14:36.610 --> 14:38.576
- Have you seen<i> Grumpy Old Men?</i>
- Yes, I've seen<i> Grumpy Old Men.</i>

14:38.645 --> 14:40.311
- Have you? Have you?
- Yes, I have!

14:40.446 --> 14:42.747
<i> Grumpy Old Men</i> is about
two grumpy old men

14:42.882 --> 14:46.117
who hate each other and fall
in love with the same woman.
- Wrong.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.286
<i> Grumpy Old Men</i> is about
two grumpy old men who appear

14:48.288 --> 14:51.322
to hate each other,
but secretly love each other
and have a great rapport

14:51.457 --> 14:53.390
and deep down, you just know
they're f(Bleep)ing.

14:53.426 --> 14:57.061
And then a lady comes along and
gets in the way of all that.
- I'm going to sleep.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.063
- OK. Sleep tight, Andy.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.199
Sleep tight knowing
the destruction you've caused.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.469
- There we go.
- Oh, thanks.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.737
Aaah, I wonder
where's Ruth's gone.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.740
- Oh, don't worry about her,
Rollie. She'll be fine.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.076
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah,
she'll be fine.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.879
You know, you don't have
to stick around so late.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.348
I promise I won't tuck in
at the first salty snack

15:17.417 --> 15:19.417
I see as soon as you leave.
(June laughing)

15:19.419 --> 15:21.352
I don't mind
staying late.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.688
I mean, it's not like
I have anyone to get home to.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.290
Husband's dead.
(laughing)

15:26.326 --> 15:29.093
- Yes, as you keep saying.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.762
- Yeah, I never told you
how he died, though.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.830
It's kind of a funny story.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.233
You see, he put so much

15:35.235 --> 15:38.969
into his museum,
but because of your antics,

15:39.005 --> 15:41.839
he never got
a chance to succeed.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.242
Anyway, long story short,

15:44.244 --> 15:47.111
he went out of business
and drank himself to death.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.180
(clock ticking)
- Oh!

15:50.216 --> 15:52.183
Sorry, June, I didn't know.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.485
- It's really alright, Rollie.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.987
Aaah...

15:56.056 --> 15:58.656
everybody has
to die sometime.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.925
- Well, you say that--
(muffled mumbling)

16:01.060 --> 16:02.694
- Hold still.
(gentle, childlike music)

16:02.829 --> 16:06.130
Yeah, chloroform takes a lot
longer than most people think.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.399
There we go.
(muffled mumbling)

16:08.401 --> 16:10.868
Ohhh! We're relaxing now?

16:10.937 --> 16:13.471
Oh... it's just like
a massage, is it?

16:13.540 --> 16:17.875
(muffled mumbling)
A massage inside your head.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.577
Here we go.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.549
Night-night. Poop!

16:32.092 --> 16:35.092
and listening to my sob story.
- I didn't hear any sobbing.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.094
Just a lot of jaw clenching

16:37.230 --> 16:39.430
and mime strangling,
which I really connected with.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.166
- I appreciate it.
- Now I'm gonna go
do up your bed.

16:42.202 --> 16:45.569
Uh, uh... You need
a toothbrush? I got a spare,

16:45.605 --> 16:48.105
but the bristles are rock hard.
It's how I like 'em.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.708
- No, it's alright.
I put some stuff in my...

16:50.710 --> 16:52.643
purse.
(Ruth gasping)

16:52.712 --> 16:54.645
- What's wrong?
- Oh, my goodness, I think

16:54.714 --> 16:57.715
I took June's purse by mistake.
- (gasping): Whoa!

16:57.850 --> 16:59.917
- Oh no, put that down! Molly!
- Let me see!

16:59.953 --> 17:03.387
Oh! Look at this.
That looks like a diary.

17:03.456 --> 17:06.324
- Well, I am gonna ask you again
to respect June's privacy.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.960
And if you don't, I'm going
to ask you a third time.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.499
- Fine, it's your life.
Night-night, Ruth.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.804
(disquieting music)
(sighing)

17:19.806 --> 17:22.273
(muffled mumbling)

17:22.342 --> 17:24.575
- He's awake.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.810
Jeez, I hope those ropes
aren't too tight.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.213
Are you OK?
(Rollie grunting)

17:29.282 --> 17:32.883
- Shh, shh, shh, shh!
You know, after my Davy died,

17:32.952 --> 17:35.553
I was consumed
by thoughts of revenge.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.355
I just... I didn't know
how I was gonna pull it off.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.359
And then, poof, your son

17:41.361 --> 17:43.294
calls my place of work

17:43.363 --> 17:45.763
asking for
a home-care worker for you,

17:45.898 --> 17:49.300
and I swear, it felt
like God was tapping me

17:49.302 --> 17:51.369
on the shoulder saying,
"Uh, June,

17:51.504 --> 17:53.637
did you forget you wanted
to kill this guy?" Hahaha!

17:53.706 --> 17:56.507
Anyway, after a few days,
trying to get

17:56.509 --> 17:59.843
rid of Ruth, here we are.
Any last words?

17:59.879 --> 18:02.547
(mumbled words)
- Well said.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.852
- Put. That. Needle.
Down. Now.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.456
Please.
- Hello, Ruth.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.059
- June...
♪♪♪

18:15.128 --> 18:17.061
I found your diary.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.198
And I almost read it
before I realized

18:20.333 --> 18:22.934
that would be very rude,
and I decided to return it.

18:23.069 --> 18:27.104
But now I see that you're
the one who's very rude.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.006
Unless I'm wrong
about what's going on here,

18:29.008 --> 18:31.342
and then I do apologize.
(screaming)

18:31.344 --> 18:34.412
(muffled thumping)
- Oh! What was that?

18:34.547 --> 18:38.215
- Oh, I think Dad
and June are having sex.
- No. I heard banging, thumping.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.284
- What part of "having sex"
do you not understand?

18:40.419 --> 18:44.221
(women screaming and grunting)
(tense music)

18:44.257 --> 18:47.024
I do not want
to walk in on this.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.627
(women screaming)
- Help!

18:49.629 --> 18:51.862
- Oh, my God! Dad?!
- Hmm!

18:51.865 --> 18:53.898
- Oh, God! Ruth snapped,
she's here for revenge!

18:54.033 --> 18:57.067
- She attacked me! She's trying
to kill your father!
- See, I told you

18:57.103 --> 18:58.702
June was a bad person.
Get her, Andy, get her!

18:58.738 --> 19:00.971
- No, she's lying!
She came back and found

19:01.040 --> 19:03.140
your father and I together,
and she tried to kill me!

19:03.176 --> 19:06.177
- So hard to know. I'm pretty
sure Ruth would never do this,

19:06.312 --> 19:08.779
but I'd be lying if I said
I was, like, certain.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.381
- June's the killer,
you moppets!

19:11.417 --> 19:13.250
- OK, yeah. June's bad,
Ruth's good; get her, Andy!

19:13.286 --> 19:15.686
- Fine! It's me!

19:15.722 --> 19:17.655
Now stay back!
- June,

19:17.790 --> 19:20.525
how did you ever expect to get
away with something like this?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.060
- Air bubble in the needle
causing a heart attack.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.062
I would have made sure
that it was too late

19:25.064 --> 19:27.698
by the time
he got to the hospital.
- That's actually pretty clever.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.634
- It would have worked.
- Well thought out.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.069
- But the time
of subtlety is over.

19:32.071 --> 19:36.540
You took away the love of
my life, Rollie; now I'm
gonna take away yours.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.810
- We've never really defined our
relationship, but I'm certainly
not the love of his life.

19:39.879 --> 19:43.214
- Yes, you are, Ruth.
♪♪♪

19:43.216 --> 19:45.216
You have been
for a long time.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.419
(Mark moaning tenderly)

19:48.421 --> 19:50.754
- How touching. You just signed
her death warrant,

19:50.823 --> 19:52.889
but it was a lovely moment.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.959
Do you have any last words?
- Yes.

19:55.094 --> 19:58.162
I forgot to return your purse!
- Argh! Ah!

19:58.297 --> 20:00.831
AAAAH!

20:00.833 --> 20:02.500
(impact on ground)

20:02.502 --> 20:04.735
(shocked exclamation)

20:07.974 --> 20:09.940
- Well, June is
in stable condition

20:10.009 --> 20:11.975
down the hall if you'd like
to check in on her.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.911
But I'm sure
that you don't.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.647
Because she tried to kill you.
- Yeah.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.615
So, how are you feeling, Dad?
- Oh, much better,

20:18.651 --> 20:21.185
thank you, Mark. Now that
I'm no longer in the clutches

20:21.187 --> 20:23.186
of a deranged murderer.
By the way,

20:23.223 --> 20:25.122
thank you very much, Andrew.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.525
A fine bit
of due diligence there.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.127
- She was from the home-care
service, it's not my fault.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.630
- Nobody's blaming you, Andrew.
- I am.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.398
- Yes. I am also.
- Me too.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.467
- That's three out of four for
blaming, you sure you don't want

20:36.536 --> 20:38.603
to change your mind there, Ruth?
- Oh, alright,

20:38.738 --> 20:40.471
I blame you too.
- Hmm!

20:40.473 --> 20:42.606
- Alright, clean sweep.
- Well, I'm just gonna go

20:42.642 --> 20:44.608
bring June this casserole
I whipped up.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.411
- OK, whoa, whoa, whoa!
She just tried to kill you.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.213
- Oh! Well, that's
in the past now.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.450
You can't hold on
to a grudge forever.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.620
- Jeez, that woman
is a saint.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.623
- Indeed she is.
Which is apparent to us all,

20:59.659 --> 21:01.625
apart from Andy of course.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.394
- (Andy): I said I was sorry!
- (Mark): You think

21:03.463 --> 21:05.229
Andy technically qualifies
as an accomplice here?

21:05.364 --> 21:07.164
- (Andy): Oh, I... What?!
- (Mark): He might be, I think.
