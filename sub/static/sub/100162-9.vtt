[air control]
Flight 104, you're strength five.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.400
[pilot] Roger that, Benson.

00:26.480 --> 00:30.480
We're passing through
flight level one seven, for 2,500.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.520
[Benson] Roger, flight 104.
Report approaching 2,500.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.320
Benson weather
is light overcast, wind calm.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.640
Thanks, Benson.

00:40.360 --> 00:44.440
We're hoping for a straight-in
visual approach to runway zero one.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.160
Roger, flight 104. That is approved.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.760
Continue descent,
and report reaching 2,500.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.880
Roger, Benson. Flight 104...

00:53.960 --> 00:55.960
[dialogue fades]

01:10.960 --> 01:13.200
[man]
Thus it hath pleased Almighty God...

01:13.280 --> 01:14.200
[bell tolls]

01:14.280 --> 01:18.240
...to take out of this transitory life
unto His Divine Mercy

01:18.800 --> 01:22.480
the late Most High, Mighty and Illustrious

01:22.560 --> 01:25.920
Prince Edward Albert Christian

01:26.520 --> 01:30.120
George Andrew Patrick David,

01:30.200 --> 01:31.600
Duke of Windsor.

01:33.040 --> 01:38.640
Sometime the Most High, Most Mighty
and Most Excellent Monarch

01:39.280 --> 01:40.680
Edward VIII.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.680
By the Grace of God,
of Great Britain, Ireland

01:49.760 --> 01:52.680
and the British Dominions beyond the Seas

01:52.920 --> 01:57.640
King, Defender of the Faith,
Emperor of India.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.360
Uncle of the Most High,

02:01.440 --> 02:04.560
Most Mighty and Most Excellent Monarch,

02:04.920 --> 02:08.480
our Sovereign Lady, Elizabeth II,

02:08.880 --> 02:11.880
whom may God preserve and bless

02:12.800 --> 02:16.920
with long life, health and honor.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.040
[Wallis] I wanted to thank you
for writing such lovely letters

02:31.120 --> 02:33.400
to David in his final days.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.520
It meant a great deal to him.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.400
And he wanted you to have this...

02:43.400 --> 02:45.840
which I gave him in 1939.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.040
A pocket watch and a compass.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.600
With an inscription.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.880
"No excuse for going
in the wrong direction."

02:58.040 --> 02:59.040
Thank you.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.040
I'm sorry not to see your girlfriend.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.200
Well, she's picking me up after this.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.200
We're spending the evening together
before I return to Dartmouth.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.520
But don't tell anyone. It's a secret.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.640
She's not official, yet.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.800
Is she the one?

03:19.840 --> 03:20.880
Yes.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.480
I think so.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.160
Then if I may offer two pieces of advice.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.560
Never turn your back on true love.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.640
Despite all the sacrifices
and all the pain,

03:34.520 --> 03:36.560
David and I never once regretted it.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.120
Thank you. And the second?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.840
Watch out for your family.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.040
They mean well.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.560
No, they don't.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.720
I saw her.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.040
The black widow.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.440
Wallis?

04:25.200 --> 04:26.760
[Camilla] Funny old crow.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.680
She stared at me. It spooked me rather.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.040
[Charles] She gave me a warning.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.880
About what?

04:35.560 --> 04:36.720
My family.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.320
-Mummy.
-Goodbye, darling.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.160
Aunt Margot.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.200
Hmm.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.720
Poor you.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.360
Is Dartmouth unbearable?

04:47.440 --> 04:49.640
Huh! What a question.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.360
Uncle Dickie.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.440
It'll be the making of you.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.920
Just remember "acting lieutenant"
doesn't mean you're in a bloody play.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.880
[Charles] It's funny.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.440
I looked at them as I was leaving.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
-Anne.
-My mother...

05:06.080 --> 05:07.160
[Anne] Charles.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.920
...father, grandmother, aunt,
even my sister, and I thought,

05:12.720 --> 05:15.040
"That's what
they must have looked like to him."

05:16.880 --> 05:19.760
-Who?
-The last Prince of Wales.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.400
The poor, lost soul we just buried.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.760
He wasn't like them.

05:28.440 --> 05:33.320
He was brighter, wittier,
more independent of thought,

05:34.040 --> 05:36.240
more true to himself.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.640
And so, they united against him.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.840
And in that moment...

05:47.080 --> 05:51.080
as they looked at me,
in some god-awful way, I realized...

05:54.040 --> 05:55.800
I have just replaced him.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.640
[woman] Come on, Edward, this way.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.760
-[Edward] What is it?
-[woman] No peeking.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.080
[gasps]

07:30.440 --> 07:31.880
-[woman laughs]
-Thank you.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.960
-But we can't afford it.
-[woman] Give it a go.

07:35.960 --> 07:36.960
Go on.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.520
[somber music plays]

08:13.120 --> 08:15.120
[crowd shouts]

08:23.200 --> 08:26.760
[reporter] In recent days,
tensions have dramatically escalated

08:26.840 --> 08:30.080
between the government
and the National Union of Mineworkers,

08:30.440 --> 08:33.280
and the resulting blockade
now threatens to close

08:33.360 --> 08:36.680
the government's
last remaining stockpile of coal.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.360
[somber music plays]

08:43.960 --> 08:46.120
[Scargill] My friends, it is time.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.080
No more standing at the bottom looking up.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.120
It's time to make yourselves heard.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.600
We've closed every mine
across this country,

08:55.040 --> 08:57.760
and we will continue to freeze stockpiles

08:57.840 --> 09:01.400
till they open their ears,
open their hearts.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.080
[Scargill] What you're seeing here today
is the beginning.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.680
The beginning
of the working classes saying enough.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.720
We have tried to reach agreement
with management, with government,

09:17.800 --> 09:19.840
but the capitalist establishment

09:19.920 --> 09:22.840
is bent on crushing
the working-class movement.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.920
So today we're tearing up that agreement,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.960
and from now on we are men of action,

09:28.040 --> 09:29.480
and we will achieve our aims

09:29.560 --> 09:31.280
by any means necessary.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.840
-[door opens]
-[dogs whimper]

09:53.920 --> 09:55.680
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.320
I am sorry, Prime Minister.
They mean no harm.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.840
All animals mean harm.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.280
-They are but a meal away from barbarism.
-[dogs yelp]

10:10.920 --> 10:13.640
One item on the agenda
above all others, I'd say.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.520
-The miners' strike.
-Oh.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.200
Which, like a fever dream,

10:18.560 --> 10:21.880
a sharp and sometimes painful
interlude of madness, will soon pass.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.880
Will it?

10:24.120 --> 10:26.760
On the surface, their demands
seem quite reasonable.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.720
A wage increase
in line with factory workers.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.960
And public sympathy for them
seems to be growing.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.040
People are sentimental and easily swayed.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.720
No, the issue that confronts us
is far more important.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.920
-Economic probity, ma'am.
-But if the strike continues?

10:42.800 --> 10:47.440
Then it will end in defeat and humiliation
for the mineworkers.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.360
We, the government,
have been quietly moving coal stocks

10:50.440 --> 10:53.080
from pitheads to power stations
these past weeks.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.560
We have eight weeks of reserves,

10:55.880 --> 10:59.000
by which time we will have wrapped up
this whole messy affair.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.600
We are prepared.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.280
-[Philip] Are you warming to him yet?
-[Elizabeth] Mr. Heath?

11:09.360 --> 11:13.240
-I'm not sure there's much to warm to.
-[Philip] Give him time. He's rusty.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.840
You're the first woman in decades
he's had a meaningful relationship with.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.600
It's what his enemies
have always held against him.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.920
-What? Thank you.
-Well, the fact he never married.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.320
People find it hard to trust a leader
without a wife and family.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.360
Apparently, there was a doctor's daughter.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.560
It was love at first sight.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.440
And she waited for him throughout the war,

11:37.400 --> 11:40.200
only for Heath to chicken out
at the last moment.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.920
So she married someone else.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.600
-Where do you get all this from?
-Some chap I met who knew Heath of old.

11:47.320 --> 11:50.480
Thinks that he, uh... never moved past it.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.640
-How sad.
-Hmm.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
There you are.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.120
When you find the right one,
snap 'em up.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.760
As a central theme, it's perfect.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.480
For what?

12:06.560 --> 12:10.280
Your speech to mark
our 25-year wedding anniversary.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.720
-Why my speech?
-Because it's your turn.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.280
I made the one on our tenth anniversary.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.280
[sighs]
Something of a triumph, as I recall.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.160
Mon petit chou.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.080
Speaking of love at first sight...

12:27.200 --> 12:30.840
I had the opportunity to read
some of Charles's letters to Uncle David

12:30.920 --> 12:33.040
about his feelings for the Shand girl.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.640
I think we need to take it seriously.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.040
-Why?
-I think he's really fallen in love.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.080
[scoffs]

12:39.080 --> 12:42.040
You don't love a girl like Camilla Shand.
She's...

12:43.520 --> 12:45.400
She's a bit of fun.

12:45.960 --> 12:49.440
Uh, and a welcome distraction
from the rigors of the Navy.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.440
The first few months can be pretty tough.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.280
[man] In line!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.360
Quicker!

13:00.880 --> 13:03.120
[Charles] Strange things, daydreams.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.600
[man] Get over it, Windsor!

13:04.680 --> 13:06.960
[Charles]
You're safe during the 6:00 a.m. drills.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.160
All that shouting and exertion
rather blows the cobwebs away.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.040
You're even fairly safe in class.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.400
I mean,
there's a rigor to astronavigation

13:19.480 --> 13:21.480
in which one can lose oneself.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.400
No, the time you're most vulnerable

13:26.480 --> 13:27.920
is when you're out at sea.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.040
Something about the waves.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.720
One begins to disappear.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.880
And then suddenly,
you're somewhere else entirely.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.320
[indistinct chatter]

13:40.400 --> 13:42.720
And there's a feeling
I've never had before.

13:43.960 --> 13:47.240
A sense of safety and belonging...

13:48.920 --> 13:51.400
and all that loneliness having vanished.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.960
And it's all rather miraculous.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.680
I think you are miraculous.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.720
Tell me,
is there any part of all this that's...

14:04.400 --> 14:05.800
surprised you?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.120
[Camilla] Of what?

14:07.720 --> 14:10.080
Our... friendship.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.640
You should ask if there's any part
of this that hasn't surprised me.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.080
A good surprise?

14:16.480 --> 14:17.560
I think so.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.360
-You don't sound certain.
-No, I am.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.040
I think.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.320
You seem to be doing a lot of thinking.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.720
That's the worst thing one can do.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.200
Why? I love thinking.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.440
[chuckles] Yes, and that's
what makes things so confusing.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
[Camilla sighs]

14:34.600 --> 14:36.120
Or gives them clarity.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.200
Not in this instance.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.040
But what we have is special.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.240
I know.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.920
But that's what makes things so confusing.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.200
Because I wasn't supposed
to fall in love with you.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.560
-None of this was supposed to happen.
-[phone beeps]

14:53.640 --> 14:55.240
What? Damn. Why?

14:55.320 --> 14:57.320
-Hello?
-What was supposed to happen?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.640
Hello?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.280
-I've run out of coins.
-[phone beeps]

15:02.360 --> 15:03.280
Hello?

15:04.760 --> 15:05.760
[sighs]

15:18.440 --> 15:20.440
[distant cheering]

15:33.800 --> 15:36.200
[officer 1] Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right...

15:45.400 --> 15:47.880
[officer 2] Shoulder. Arms.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.280
Inwards turn.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.240
Parade will advance.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.240
Right turn.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.000
Parade halt.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.680
That's not the face
I'd hoped to see opposite me.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.080
Commander of the college
wrote to me only last week,

16:21.800 --> 16:24.440
saying how encouraged he was
by your progress.

16:26.240 --> 16:30.320
A progress which, in his estimation,
compares you favorably with your father,

16:31.720 --> 16:35.800
and your grandfather before him,
and great grandfather before him.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.000
I know you had your own ideas,

16:39.080 --> 16:42.280
your vision of where you belong.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.040
I simply ask
that you stick with it a little.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.440
It's not the college.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.720
Well, then what is it?

16:52.440 --> 16:55.160
[sighs] Camilla.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.520
Shand?

16:58.360 --> 17:00.000
Hmm.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.680
You two still amusing one another,
are you?

17:02.760 --> 17:03.680
[chuckles]

17:03.760 --> 17:04.640
We are.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.800
-I like her very much.
-Good. Good.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.200
I like her very much indeed.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
Hmm.

17:15.360 --> 17:18.440
The situation is complicated.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.680
I'm not the only interested party.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.280
Oh!

17:24.560 --> 17:27.960
You mean the donkey-walloper?
Parker Bowles? Hmm?

17:28.160 --> 17:30.040
Dickie, I don't want to lose her.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.400
Dear boy,

17:31.920 --> 17:34.000
you're not going to lose any woman.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.080
You're the Prince of Wales.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.360
I mean, I don't want to lose her ever.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.440
Hmm.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.560
She's the one.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.640
Now I think you understand
what I'm saying,

17:57.880 --> 17:59.800
and why I'm going to need your help...

18:01.520 --> 18:02.760
with the family.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.320
[officer] Eyes right.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.440
Eyes front.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.480
[Mountbatten] My fault entirely.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.200
The Shand girl
was only ever meant to be an opportunity

18:44.280 --> 18:47.760
for an inexperienced boy
to sow his wild oats.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.920
That's why I encouraged it. Indulged it.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.880
-I never expected him to develop feelings.
-[scoffs]

18:57.960 --> 18:59.360
Let alone nurture thoughts of--

18:59.600 --> 19:02.160
Don't even say it. It's madness.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.920
And the sooner that girl's back where
she belongs, with Derek's boy, the better.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.440
Hmm, I agree.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.040
How shall we handle this?

19:11.480 --> 19:13.440
Well, I can take care of Charles.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.960
Nice long posting overseas
will bring him to his senses.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.360
I'll speak to everyone at the Admiralty.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.120
Eight months on the other side
of the world, it'll soon go away.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.960
Hmm, let's hope so.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.080
Can I leave the Shands
and the Parker Bowles families to you?

19:31.040 --> 19:32.440
-With pleasure.
-Hmm.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.520
[Scargill] You play the organ, don't you?

19:53.680 --> 19:54.560
I do.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.600
-Hmm. And the pianoforte?
-Yes.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.400
What smooth, elegant hands you have.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.840
Long, delicate fingers.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.120
-You ever seen a pit, Mr. Heath?
-Of course.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.160
Not on your television. In person.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.280
Then let's help you...

20:18.400 --> 20:19.640
get acquainted.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.160
Pick it up.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.240
Go on.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
Touch it.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.080
Smell it.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.280
So, next time you're playing the organ
in some cathedral

20:45.360 --> 20:48.080
having lofty thoughts
in the heavens close to God,

20:48.160 --> 20:50.600
think of my members, my comrades,

20:50.680 --> 20:53.320
down there in the heat and the darkness,
digging for coal,

20:53.400 --> 20:55.520
because when they go to work

20:55.600 --> 20:57.960
and break their backs
and risk their lives,

20:58.240 --> 20:59.680
they're nowhere near God.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.720
They're in hell,
and they're doing that day in, day out,

21:03.800 --> 21:05.880
so that you
and everyone else in this country,

21:05.960 --> 21:08.120
can have heat and electricity and power.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.440
We will make no progress,

21:09.520 --> 21:11.640
if you concentrate
only on our differences.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.600
No, you're wrong.
That's the only way we'll make progress.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.760
Until you recognize
the miners' contribution to this country

21:17.840 --> 21:21.200
is what keeps the lights on
in factories, schools, hospitals

21:21.680 --> 21:23.440
and grand rooms like these,

21:23.520 --> 21:26.280
then there can be no agreements
made with the NUM.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.960
Well, let's talk for a minute
about "grand rooms like this."

21:29.040 --> 21:31.920
I'm just as much a stranger
to rooms like this as you are.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.720
My father was a builder.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.520
I got here because I'm the leader
of a political party

21:37.600 --> 21:40.800
elected by the people of this country
to lead their government.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.640
This is not my home.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.520
This is the home
the people of this country

21:44.600 --> 21:46.120
give the Queen's first minister.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.360
It is grand, because we respect democracy.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.200
You can make simple assumptions
about who I am

21:53.280 --> 21:55.240
by virtue of the fact
that I play the organ.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.400
My parents couldn't afford
to buy a piano for me.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.600
They had to pay for it in installments
from a shop in Margate.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.880
No, let's not waste time
on bogus disagreements

22:06.120 --> 22:08.280
about a class struggle between you and me.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.920
I come from a background
not so far removed from you.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.160
But I have chosen democracy, unlike you,

22:18.600 --> 22:22.680
and I will not have you,
or any other hoodlum come in here

22:22.760 --> 22:26.680
and threaten a democratic government
with undemocratic strikes.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.000
This government has its policy,

22:29.640 --> 22:33.800
and will not be deviated from it... ever!

22:38.960 --> 22:40.200
And we have ours...

22:43.520 --> 22:44.800
and nor will we.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.080
[door opens]

23:00.240 --> 23:01.280
[door closes]

23:01.920 --> 23:03.800
[Charteris]
Now that talks between the government

23:03.880 --> 23:05.440
and the mineworkers have broken down,

23:05.520 --> 23:07.680
the Prime Minister has come up
with a scheme

23:07.760 --> 23:10.560
for nationwide power cuts
to conserve energy.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.240
[Philip] Christ.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.920
I've seen battle plans
that are less complicated.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.240
Well, that's exactly
what the government is calling it.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.880
A battle plan to defeat the miners.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.920
[Elizabeth] And we expect
these power cuts to start soon?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.480
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Elizabeth] And for how long?

23:25.560 --> 23:28.240
For the rest of this month,
perhaps even year.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.680
What? This will devastate the country.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.800
Indeed, there will be interruptions
to the normal functioning of government

23:33.880 --> 23:36.400
and the judiciary and the civil service.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.840
Hospitals may have
to carry out operations by torchlight.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.600
But Mr. Heath is confident of victory.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.440
[Heath] As Prime Minister,

23:50.200 --> 23:53.640
I want to speak to you
simply and plainly tonight

23:53.960 --> 23:57.360
about the grave emergency
now facing our country.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.640
In the House of Commons this afternoon,

24:01.720 --> 24:05.880
I announced more severe restrictions
on the use of electricity.

24:07.840 --> 24:12.080
We are asking you
to cut down to the absolute minimum

24:12.160 --> 24:15.600
its use for heating
and for other purposes in your home.

24:16.760 --> 24:20.880
In industry we are limiting
the supply of electricity

24:20.960 --> 24:24.440
to almost all factories, shops and offices

24:24.520 --> 24:26.720
to three days a week.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.000
In terms of comfort,

24:29.080 --> 24:33.760
we shall have a harder Christmas
than we have known since the war.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.760
In the kind of country we live in...

24:39.000 --> 24:41.520
there can be no "we" or "they."

24:42.120 --> 24:43.800
It is only "us."

24:44.720 --> 24:46.400
All of us.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.960
If the government is defeated,

24:51.520 --> 24:54.480
then the country is defeated.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.000
[man]
Major and Mrs. Shand, Your Majesty,

25:20.080 --> 25:21.880
and Mr. and Mrs. Parker Bowles.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.920
[door closes]

25:30.560 --> 25:33.320
-Thank you for coming, Major Shand.
-Your Majesty.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.040
-Mrs. Shand.
-Your Majesty.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.960
-Derek.
-Your Majesty.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.880
-Ann.
-Your Majesty.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.080
Please.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.240
You're probably wondering why
I've invited you all here this afternoon.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.280
It's a slightly delicate matter.

25:58.360 --> 26:02.000
Something of an imbroglio
involving your son, Derek,

26:02.080 --> 26:03.720
your daughter, Mrs. Shand,

26:03.800 --> 26:06.840
and my grandson, the Prince of Wales.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.920
[pants]

26:11.480 --> 26:12.480
[officer] Windsor.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.800
You're wanted on the quarterdeck.
Captain's office.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.440
Sir.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.200
[captain] Windsor, come in.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.680
We now have the results from the exams,

26:36.040 --> 26:38.560
and the examining body has concluded

26:38.640 --> 26:40.960
that you have met the necessary criteria

26:41.040 --> 26:44.240
to undertake your duties
as officer of the watch.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.320
Your first official posting.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.800
Congratulations.

26:57.080 --> 26:59.080
Am I allowed to know where to?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.720
Oh, Christ! Not again!

27:02.720 --> 27:05.680
Jenkins, fetch another lamp
and some candles, will you?

27:05.800 --> 27:07.400
-[Jenkins] Yes, sir.
-[door opens]

27:40.200 --> 27:41.880
[typewriter clicks]

27:44.160 --> 27:45.560
[Charteris] Your Royal Highness.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.320
-Martin.
-Sir.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.000
I wonder if the Queen
might have a minute for me.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.720
Uh, it's not the best moment, sir.
She's writing a speech.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.040
Could you tell her
I've come all the way from Dartmouth

27:57.120 --> 27:58.520
and that it's very important?

27:59.840 --> 28:00.880
Of course, sir.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.800
Excuse me, sir.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.600
[man] Excuse me, sir.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.640
[woman] Excuse me, sir.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.920
[typewriter clicks]

28:23.760 --> 28:25.400
Her Majesty will see you now, sir.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.080
-Sorry to interrupt, Mummy.
-I didn't know you were on leave.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.720
-I'm not.
-Then why are you here?

28:40.240 --> 28:43.000
-I've come to ask you a question.
-Hmm.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.400
I've been given a posting.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.960
Eight months in the Caribbean.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.240
That's not a question.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.840
I'm not happy about it.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.520
-Still not a question.
-All right.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.920
Here's the question.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.080
-Did you arrange it?
-Why would I have arranged it?

29:05.360 --> 29:08.080
To separate us, break us up.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.920
-Who?
-Camilla Shand and me.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.360
-You said you'd been given a promotion.
-A posting, not a promotion.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.360
And one that makes no sense.
I'm not eligible for a posting yet.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.320
I'm not qualified.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.000
People make all kinds of exceptions
for members of the royal family.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
Not the Navy.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.200
They pride themselves on making
no exceptions ever. My question is,

29:26.280 --> 29:29.600
did you or anyone else in this family
have something to do with this?

29:31.160 --> 29:33.560
-Why would we do that?
-I've no idea.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.040
Because she's not "intact,"

29:36.960 --> 29:40.520
or not the right family,
or because she has a mind of her own,

29:40.600 --> 29:42.240
or perhaps just because it amuses everyone

29:42.320 --> 29:44.600
to take two people
who are perfectly happy together

29:44.680 --> 29:46.040
and find a reason to break them up.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.720
Because there is history
of that cruelty in this family!

29:48.920 --> 29:50.360
Well, I won't stand for it!

29:50.920 --> 29:54.480
I won't be pushed aside
like Uncle David or Aunt Margot.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.400
I won't stand for it.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.760
[Elizabeth] Martin.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.880
Queen Elizabeth and Lord Mountbatten.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.200
I'd like to see them
as soon as possible, together.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.040
[footsteps approach]

30:28.000 --> 30:29.240
[door opens]

30:29.320 --> 30:31.080
[Mountbatten] Everything was fine.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.760
Everyone was getting what they wanted
and needed from the arrangement.

30:35.520 --> 30:39.040
-Till the boy started talking about love.
-But what if it is love?

30:39.520 --> 30:43.080
Shouldn't it be allowed to run its course?
I was allowed to marry my choice.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.240
That was different.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.880
His rank was different.
The feelings were the same.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.600
The times were different.
His past was different.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.080
Philip was a royal prince.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.960
Does that still matter
in this day and age?

30:54.040 --> 30:55.040
It does.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.960
The system is too... fragile, too precious

31:00.040 --> 31:03.080
to let in unpredictable elements,
dangerous elements.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.280
Camilla isn't dangerous.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.120
She's the first woman Charles has met
that gives him confidence

31:08.200 --> 31:09.800
and comfort and self-belief.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.000
Qualities I think we all agree
he will one day need.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.880
I understand you are both taking steps
to protect the Crown,

31:17.240 --> 31:18.800
but given the history of this family,

31:18.880 --> 31:20.920
I don't think we can afford
to break up two people

31:21.000 --> 31:22.280
that truly love one another.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.200
We've learned that lesson
time and time again.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.280
[Queen Mother] Trust me.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.320
This is anything but love.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.280
Dickie.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.240
There is something you should know.

Come in, darling.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.680
[Philip clears throat]

33:20.440 --> 33:22.680
We'd like to ask you some questions.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.800
And it's important
while answering those questions

33:26.880 --> 33:32.560
that you remain clearheaded,
unemotional, rational and calm.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.960
As opposed to what? The hysterical
and neurotic way I normally behave?

33:36.040 --> 33:37.600
[Philip chuckles]

33:38.800 --> 33:39.760
[clears throat]

33:40.040 --> 33:42.080
[Mountbatten]
We need to talk to you about your brother.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.840
Which one? I have three.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.760
[Philip] Charles.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.280
Go on.

33:48.640 --> 33:53.720
Specifically, the suitability
of his match with Camilla Shand.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.240
Match?

33:56.200 --> 33:59.760
We believe it's his intention
to ask her to marry him.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.040
Fine.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.960
As long as he's prepared for there
to always be three in the marriage.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.360
The third being?

34:09.920 --> 34:11.600
Andrew Parker Bowles.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.720
Camilla's first love,
and the man she's still devoted to.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.440
She's not devoted to Charles?

34:16.520 --> 34:19.320
She likes Charles,
but she's obsessed with Andrew.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.000
Spare me.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.680
How do you know all this?

34:28.680 --> 34:30.520
Because I was briefly
caught up in it myself.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.000
Wait a minute.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.960
-When?
-Then. In the past. It doesn't matter.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.560
It was all very straightforward.

34:39.640 --> 34:42.080
He got what he wanted,
which was to make Camilla jealous.

34:42.160 --> 34:45.640
I got what I wanted,
which was a bit of fun.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.080
-Fun?
-Yes, sorry, Mummy. It was.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.720

Is that it? Inquisition over.
Can I go now?

Thank you, darling.

for you all.

I'm not sure I know where to begin.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.480
Obviously, poor Charles.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.680
-Stupid, naive Charles.
-Yes.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.920
-And Anne?
-Yes.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.120
I mean... who would have thought it?

35:51.280 --> 35:52.240
Hmm.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.480
So, what's the next step?

35:55.560 --> 35:56.960
The families have been spoken to.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.200
A date has been set for Camilla
to be married to the Parker Bowles boy.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.160
[Elizabeth] Good.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.560
All that's missing is
for someone to let them know.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.360
-Will you tell Charles?
-That would achieve nothing.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.960
It would achieve a great deal.
It would clear the air.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.320
And since you approve of the decision,

36:14.400 --> 36:17.600
as his mother, and Queen,
it's the right thing to do.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.520
It would only create rancor
and resentment,

36:20.600 --> 36:22.640
and while I may approve of the decision,

36:22.720 --> 36:24.640
none of this nonsense was my idea.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.320
Dickie can do it.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.280
This is his mess.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.360
[music plays over dialogue]

37:14.200 --> 37:16.640
[man on TV] During yesterday's
extended power cuts,

37:16.720 --> 37:20.440
it was almost impossible for
many families who depend on electricity

37:20.520 --> 37:23.520
to cook, or to heat
and light their homes.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.920
Summer camping stoves
and old paraffin lamps

37:27.000 --> 37:29.240
have been brought out of the attic
and dusted down.

37:29.800 --> 37:34.040
It's now almost impossible
to buy a candle, a stove or a heater.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.320
In ironmongers
it's always the same notice,

37:37.400 --> 37:40.320
and orders for fresh supplies
have been in for days.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.800
With millions now unable to work,
people have taken to the streets,

37:44.880 --> 37:47.080
and tensions are starting to rise.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.400
[crowd chants]
Heath out! Heath out! Heath out!

37:50.480 --> 37:53.640
[reporter] There are now genuine fears
for the stability of the country,

37:53.720 --> 37:55.800
and the maintenance of law and order.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.800
[Charles] I don't know where to begin.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.120
What to say.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.960
Is it true? Do you love Andrew?

38:06.600 --> 38:09.280
-[Camilla] It's complicated.
-Nothing complicated about it.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.360
[Camilla sighs]

38:11.120 --> 38:13.400
It's a yes or no answer. Do you love him?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.280
Yes.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.520
[sighs] In a manner of speaking.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.400
I'm such a fool.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.000
But the more time I spent with you,

38:25.760 --> 38:28.600
the more I got to know you,
the more my feelings changed.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.400
[man] Transport is waiting, sir.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.080
-Obviously not enough.
-But that's not true.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.320
[sighs] Whatever anyone tells you,

38:41.880 --> 38:44.440
you must believe
that my feelings for you are real.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.440
Then why have we allowed them to do this?

38:48.520 --> 38:51.040
Because apparently
this way it'll be better for everyone.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.760
[sighs] In the long run.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.520
[sighs]

39:27.560 --> 39:30.440
[Elizabeth] If it were the occasional
blackout, I would understand,

39:30.520 --> 39:33.560
but when it disrupts everyday life,
up and down the country,

39:33.680 --> 39:36.160
indeed threatens lives,
threatens law and order,

39:36.240 --> 39:39.440
I do begin to wonder whether we really
have taken the right course of action.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.640
Well, ma'am,
the government is not to blame.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.920
The National Union of Mineworkers
has been given every opportunity,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
and has rejected offer after offer.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.360
Our last, a more than generous package
worth £48 million,

39:50.440 --> 39:52.200
was met with wholesale contempt.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.600
But that does not explain the blackouts.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.000
I distinctly remember you assuring me

39:57.160 --> 40:00.640
that the government had stockpiled
enough coal to weather any storm,

40:00.720 --> 40:01.720
and yet here we are.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.640
It's true, the strikes have lasted longer
than we anticipated,

40:05.720 --> 40:07.760
and the stubbornness
of the miners and unions

40:07.840 --> 40:09.680
has been considerably more violent.

40:09.760 --> 40:13.280
I think we can safely say
there has been stubbornness on both sides.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.760
And one does wonder
if we have failed to understand

40:15.840 --> 40:17.640
the scale of the miners' anger.

40:17.720 --> 40:21.480
Indeed if we have failed
to understand them, as people.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.920
I do feel slightly for Charles.

41:30.880 --> 41:31.800
Yes.

41:33.880 --> 41:34.960
It will hurt.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.960
And for a while
it might even feel like a betrayal.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.280
But then he'll come to his senses,

41:42.800 --> 41:44.120
and it will be forgotten.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.520
I hope so.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.360
[Elizabeth] I must admit, my Lord Mayor,

42:11.160 --> 42:13.680
that the first 25 years of marriage

42:13.760 --> 42:15.280
have rather crept up on us.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.040
I'm not much given to philosophizing,

42:19.760 --> 42:21.120
but from time to time

42:21.680 --> 42:23.840
one is presented with an opportunity

42:24.520 --> 42:27.000
to reflect upon what has contributed

42:27.080 --> 42:28.640
to the success of something.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.640
And in the case of our marriage,
it's family.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.840
The rock upon which any enduring marriage

42:36.920 --> 42:38.600
must surely be founded.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.560
A network of brothers, sisters,

42:43.280 --> 42:45.240
mothers and fathers,

42:45.760 --> 42:48.080
cousins and relations.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.440
A filigree of a thousand tiny threads,

42:53.280 --> 42:54.480
woven together

42:54.560 --> 42:59.080
by blood, kinship and trust.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.840
Only there,

43:06.560 --> 43:09.760
within that crucible
of family relationships,

43:10.240 --> 43:12.080
can a successful union

43:12.160 --> 43:15.000
between two people be forged.

43:16.800 --> 43:19.400
Fealty, allegiance,

43:19.480 --> 43:21.760
obedience and devotion.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.120
These are Christian values

43:24.960 --> 43:26.760
that sustain a marriage...

43:28.120 --> 43:30.280
and that bind a family together.

43:35.040 --> 43:39.240
To realize that elusive state
of being a happy family

43:39.480 --> 43:42.760
is a tireless struggle, a battle...

43:44.360 --> 43:46.600
but it is a battle worth fighting

43:48.080 --> 43:50.960
for there is nothing in life to match it.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.960
The right kind of partnership...

43:57.040 --> 43:58.920
with the right kind of partner

43:59.800 --> 44:04.880
is the foundation
on which a successful family must rest.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.400
Marriage is a proposition

44:09.480 --> 44:12.000
some in the modern world
would question...

44:14.000 --> 44:17.840
but it is a proposition about which,
when asked,

44:18.160 --> 44:22.160
I can reply, plainly and unequivocally...

44:24.160 --> 44:25.360
"I am for it."
