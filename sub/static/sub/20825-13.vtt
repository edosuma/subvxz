WEBVTT

00:10.135 --> 00:12.512
Oh, Congressman Romero,

00:12.513 --> 00:16.056
I just wanted to see you one last time
before I leave.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.726
I don't believe
there's anything left to be said.

00:17.727 --> 00:20.478
No, not between us. Not any longer.

00:20.479 --> 00:25.859
I just wanted to thank you for...
your tenacity.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.238
Whatever you're up to,
you won't get away with it.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.240
Maybe I already have.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.745
The committee will continue its work.
We'll recommend charges to DOJ.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.331

00:50.217 --> 00:51.760
Rochelle.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.930
Such a lovely name.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.810
Tell me how much you don't want that
to end up in the press.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.563
And then shut this committee down.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.897
No deals.

01:09.527 --> 01:12.114
Mr. President! Mr. President!

03:00.555 --> 03:01.848
How could you?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.225
- How could you not warn me?
- To protect you.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.895
- I was protecting you.
- You should take your hands off me.

03:06.896 --> 03:08.855
No, look, I understand
if you feel broadsided.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.899
- I don't care about feelings, Francis.
- But listen to me...

03:10.900 --> 03:13.734
- Look, Claire, listen to me.
- You made me look absolutely ridiculous.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.695
- Ill-prepared and ignorant.
- No! Claire.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.197
- We have one rule, Francis. One rule.
- No, not anymore.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.699
Not anymore. We don't.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.618
I cannot be your ally
if I don't know what you're thinking.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.996
Listen, Claire. It would have never ended.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.581
All right, fine, we got to stop judiciary,

03:27.582 --> 03:31.252
but other committees would have sprung up,
just to keep the charges going.

03:31.253 --> 03:34.839
Oversight, Armed Services,
Foreign Affairs, Intelligence.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.007
It would have gone on and on.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.759
- Years and years of investigation.
- I don't care.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.302
You should have talked to me,

03:39.303 --> 03:41.763
instead of making
a last-minute decision like this.

03:41.764 --> 03:42.890
I didn't.

03:44.557 --> 03:50.230
I created this confusion
in order to take advantage of it.

03:50.814 --> 03:55.527
Everything that has happened...
was planned.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.613
Since when?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.992
Since before Elysian Fields.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.411
But it was at Elysian Fields
that it hit me.

04:05.412 --> 04:11.293
I saw it... almost like a light bulb
going off above my head.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.755
Where does the real power lie?

04:15.756 --> 04:19.134
The power behind the power.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.845
And I understood, Claire,

04:21.846 --> 04:26.474
that we have to think and act differently
than we ever have.

04:26.475 --> 04:30.020
Because it's no longer about
who lives in the White House...

04:32.439 --> 04:35.691
it's about who owns the White House.

04:35.692 --> 04:39.320
This is the presidency.
How much higher can a politician go?

04:39.321 --> 04:41.782
The real power isn't here.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.700
It's beyond here.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.996
It's above it, but still working
in conjunction with it.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.832
Look, Claire,
you and I have always been on the inside.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.501
Trapped. In the bubble.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.588
But going forward...

04:57.547 --> 05:01.342
with my operating on the outside,
in the private sector,

05:01.343 --> 05:04.554
and you working from here...

05:06.764 --> 05:09.935
we can own this house together.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.649
Don't you see? I've designed this.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.403
I wanted you to be the president.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.616
I've made you the president.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.787
Am I supposed to say thank you?

05:30.455 --> 05:31.998
No.

05:31.999 --> 05:36.252
But you will have to pardon me.
Pardon me for all of my crimes.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.421
As the president,
you're the only one who can.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.256
Francis, I could be impeached
if I do that.

05:40.257 --> 05:44.052
No, no. Look, Davis and Usher,
they're in a position to protect you.

05:44.053 --> 05:47.221
- They want you to succeed.
- We can be sure of nothing, Francis.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.933
Everything going on with Doug,
the leak still in the White House...

05:49.934 --> 05:51.768
No, that was me, too.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.605
- What?
- I'm the leak.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.566
I've been feeding information
to Tom Hammerschmidt

05:58.567 --> 06:00.485
for months with Doug's help.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.905
That doesn't make any sense, Francis.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.616
Claire, when you bring yourself down
before someone else can,

06:07.617 --> 06:09.661
you control the way it happens.

06:10.787 --> 06:15.916
This was the only path
to get us to this moment

06:15.917 --> 06:19.837
where you and I can own it all.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.640
Get rid of the surveillance.

06:31.308 --> 06:35.353
Erase it. Shut everything down.
Anything you and Doug were up to.

06:35.354 --> 06:38.689
All right.
But you have to pardon me first.

06:38.690 --> 06:43.153
And, at the right time, Doug.
Or we could both go to prison.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.241
I killed Tom.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.785
I killed Tom Yates. He's dead.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.289
And I had Mark clean it up.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.710
So it will never make its way back to us.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.969
Well, then I guess we both did
what we had to.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.055
- Did you know he was gonna do this?
- No.

07:11.056 --> 07:15.352
- Because this is bad, Claire.
- This is very... very bad.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.064
My God!

07:20.190 --> 07:21.857
What is it with you two?

07:21.858 --> 07:25.069
- If there's something on your mind, say...
- In my house?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.445
You left him in my house?!

07:26.446 --> 07:29.699
Lower your voice,
or at least change your tone.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.035
Did you take care of it?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.455
Yes, that's what I do.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.291
Then thank you, and well done.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.751
Now let's get back
to what's in front of us.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.753
Does he even want you to be here, Claire?

07:42.754 --> 07:45.381
Mark, please. What I need right now
is your political calculus.

07:45.382 --> 07:49.177
He has put you, he has put all of us,
in an impossible position.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.553
You see that?

07:52.055 --> 07:55.308
If you don't handle this correctly,
you do not recover from it.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.311
This is about continuity of government.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.899
Informing NATO, informing world leaders.
We should have had ambassadors on call.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.985
Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the National Security...

08:05.986 --> 08:08.405
Even Nixon did that!

08:12.575 --> 08:14.368
<i>I'm ready to hand it over,</i>

08:14.369 --> 08:16.079
<i>but I want to be assured
that no matter what,</i>

08:16.080 --> 08:18.122
<i>Macallan's death is not related to me.</i>

08:18.123 --> 08:20.124
That can be taken care of.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.752
- I want what you have of mine.
<i>- Okay.</i>

08:23.336 --> 08:24.670
That's what you'll get.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.049
And I want to be Chief of Staff.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.511
Well, I don't think that's a problem.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.597
I'm glad you're asking for what you want.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.563
Doug Stamper would do anything
for the president.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.943
He saw a threat in Zoe Barnes,
who the president was involved with.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.362
And he took care of it.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.698
He's threatened my life
on numerous occasions.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.409
- But to go back to my question...
- No, ma'am.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.454
I don't think the president knew
what Doug was up to.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.872
Not at all.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.964
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.467
I've been meaning to call you.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.180
Sean.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.932
As you can tell, I work here now.

09:19.642 --> 09:24.063
I'm shaking your hand right now
because I believe in social graces.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.692
You're lost.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.779
- I don't think so.
- No, you are.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.697
No, not at all.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.200
This is what you wanted?

09:35.825 --> 09:40.579
A job in a corrupt administration?
Presidency in ruin?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.583
I'm in the White House. Not out there,
wondering what it's like in here.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.045
Not for long.

09:48.046 --> 09:51.757
Once you're in, you're in.
It's the American way.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.594
- Mr. Stamper will see you now.
- Thank you.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.019
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.438
When I asked for this meeting,
I had no idea

10:05.439 --> 10:08.441
the president would be signing
his resignation this evening.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.694
And I, this morning.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.947
- I heard a rumor you might.
- Now it's confirmed.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.324
Mr. Stamper...

10:16.325 --> 10:18.785
Yeah, please. You can call me Doug.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.913
I'd rather not,
for the sake of this interview.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.208
I want you to know
this will not be off the record,

10:25.209 --> 10:26.501
or on background.

10:29.212 --> 10:32.924
I do know Lisa Williams.
I met her a couple years ago.

10:35.885 --> 10:36.928
Okay.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.972
But before we get to anything else...

10:42.392 --> 10:46.229
did President Underwood,
when he was congressman, kill Zoe Barnes?

10:49.566 --> 10:50.817
No.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.610
Mr. Stamper...

10:56.656 --> 10:58.824
did you kill Zoe Barnes?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.077
I'm not prepared to answer that question.

11:02.119 --> 11:05.122
You understand I can use
your refusal in print.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.500
Yes.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.336
Were you on the Cathedral Heights
D.C. Metro platform

11:10.337 --> 11:11.712
the day of Zoe's death?

11:11.713 --> 11:15.633
Any questions regarding Zoe Barnes,
you need to speak with my attorneys.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.056
Did Zoe Barnes make a call
to Francis Underwood

11:23.057 --> 11:25.768
from a burner phone
when he was congressman?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.229
- Why would you ask me that?
- Why won't you answer?

11:29.230 --> 11:31.732
I almost always answer
the president's phone.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.401
Calls, texts...

11:35.862 --> 11:37.655
Do you have any knowledge of those texts?

11:37.656 --> 11:39.699
I'm not prepared to comment on that.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.660
Then this conversation is over.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.293
Have a good day.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.299
One last thing.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.302
Did you send me two birthday cards?

11:59.969 --> 12:00.970
No.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.562
<i>Slàinte mhath.</i>

12:09.563 --> 12:11.855
That's Scottish Gaelic.
It means "good health."

12:11.856 --> 12:13.691
My father's kind of obsessed.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.528
And he traced our line of Graysons
back to, like, 16th century or something.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.948
Hmm. Well, if we ever needed a drink
in the middle of the day...

12:22.116 --> 12:24.994
It went well with the US attorney.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.247
It's tragic.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.377
Our hearts are just broken
at the thought of what Doug did.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.921
I don't know what happened to him.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.924
I guess somewhere along the line...

12:39.216 --> 12:41.385
When will, uh,
he be announcing his resignation?

12:41.386 --> 12:44.847
- It's happening this afternoon.
- Oh, of course.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.266
And, Seth, you'll need to resign as well.

12:49.936 --> 12:53.772
- Uh... Um, I thought that, uh...
- I know, but think about this.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.610
I need to establish my own team. Publicly.

12:57.611 --> 13:01.905
And there's no avoiding how tied
you and Doug are to Francis at this point.

13:01.906 --> 13:06.285
So, it's really just waiting
for the dust to settle. That's all.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.581
Why does it feel like you're telling me
my career is over, Madam Vice President?

13:10.582 --> 13:14.293
No, I'm just saying, you just need
to go away for a little while.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.714
And we'll bring you back into the fold
at a later date, and don't worry.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.634
Look at LeAnn.
She left and now she's back.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.930
Have we ever had a drink together?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.016
Never.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.829
I wanted to hand this to you
while you were still president.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.340
I accept this with a heavy heart.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.138
I had a strategy session
with the attorneys yesterday.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.849
I hope they're treating you well.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.021
You know...

14:17.064 --> 14:20.610
Doug, we're not gonna be able
to see each other for some time now.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.537
So why don't you take something?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.288
- No.
- No, no. Go on. Take something.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.292
Anything. Anything you want.
Even if it's small.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.379
Something you can hold in your hand

14:40.380 --> 14:45.217
to remind you of this place...
until you get back.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.179
You go on.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.749
We're a few hours away
from my official resignation...

15:58.500 --> 16:02.336
and you still have not agreed
to pardon me.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.130
And if you don't,

16:05.131 --> 16:09.217
I will be forced to renege
on that resignation.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.344
That would be outrageous.

16:11.345 --> 16:15.307
Well, it isn't official until I submit
a signed letter.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.519
And what would that do
to the rest of your presidency?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.062
What would be left of it?

16:20.063 --> 16:23.691
Claire, if you don't do it, you're gonna
risk being married to a felon.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.318
And if I do, where does that leave me?

16:26.319 --> 16:29.029
Look, is this really the conversation
you want to be having?

16:29.030 --> 16:30.573
You've trapped me, Francis.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.283
No, I do not accept
that I've done something to you.

16:33.284 --> 16:37.329
I have provided you with an opportunity.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.750
Now, you have said before,
that this is your endgame.

16:41.751 --> 16:46.004
And now, your goal is
within spitting distance

16:46.005 --> 16:50.051
and all you see is betrayal?
I don't buy it.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.306
Stop talking about what I've done to you.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.311
Admit it.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.105
This is what you want.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.108
You were willing to kill for it.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.612
So, Claire, come and take it...

17:11.531 --> 17:13.365
before I take it back.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.044
We'll find the most strategic
time and place.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.421
But I will pardon you, Francis.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.826
For the good of the nation,
we need to disband this committee,

17:57.827 --> 17:59.536
and put this behind us.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.539
The president most likely
would not have survived the hearings.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.668
You could argue that he had no choice
but to resign.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.837
But we can't deny that his testimony
struck a chord.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.798
Well, that may be true.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.341
But how is it that you,
Congressman Romero,

18:13.342 --> 18:16.804
his biggest critic,
are supporting him now?

18:19.473 --> 18:20.974
History.

18:20.975 --> 18:24.436
By the end of the day, the country
will have its first woman president.

18:25.146 --> 18:28.816
Look, I've always been a supporter
of the idea of a woman in the Oval Office.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.401
But when all is said and done,

18:31.402 --> 18:34.321
you do realize that Francis Underwood

18:34.322 --> 18:37.283
will still be sleeping
in the White House tonight?

18:50.963 --> 18:55.050
Isn't this when you pack everything up?
Or at least take the personal things?

18:55.051 --> 18:56.886
I'm not taking anything.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.140
You can do what you want with it.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.691
- When do you meet with the US attorney?
- Day after tomorrow.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.491
I never thought that Frank Underwood
would not be president.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.828
Not really.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.084
You could just run away.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.128
What does that get me?

19:31.713 --> 19:33.588
You're good at taking care of yourself.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.926
That's funny.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.845
Look, I want you to know
that I care for you,

19:39.846 --> 19:42.765
but I don't know how much I can be there.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.565
I think I'm gonna just sit here
for a while.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.318
Yeah, you should.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.659
Uh, the vice president would like you
to leave the White House

20:02.660 --> 20:03.870
before she's sworn in.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.624
She doesn't think it would be a good idea
for word to get out

20:09.625 --> 20:11.543
that you were here when it happened.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.656
<i>I do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute</i>

20:41.657 --> 20:45.118
<i>the office of President
of the United States,</i>

20:45.119 --> 20:47.412
<i>and will to the best of my ability</i>

20:47.413 --> 20:52.625
preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.962
- So help me God.
- Here we are again.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.297
You know, if you ignore
all the pomp and circumstance,

20:57.298 --> 21:01.593
the most perverse thing is
I actually believe in the presidency.

21:01.594 --> 21:05.513
Its importance. What it means
around the world, even symbolically.

21:05.514 --> 21:10.477
But I believe in power even more.
For its own sake.

21:11.145 --> 21:15.565
Gore Vidal once wrote
that power is an end to itself,

21:15.566 --> 21:19.403
and the instinctive urge to prevail...

21:19.946 --> 21:22.824
the most important single human trait.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.452
I've always told myself that
everything I did was for her.

21:27.453 --> 21:31.916
But maybe it wasn't.
Maybe I love power more.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.669
<i>For you, and for any dear to you,</i>

21:36.670 --> 21:38.839
<i>I would do anything.</i>

21:38.840 --> 21:41.549
<i>If my career were of that better kind</i>

21:41.550 --> 21:46.179
<i>that there was any opportunity
or capacity to sacrifice in it,</i>

21:46.180 --> 21:51.143
<i>I would embrace any sacrifice for you
and for those dear to you.</i>

21:51.811 --> 21:56.231
<i>Try to hold me in your mind,
at some quiet times,</i>

21:56.232 --> 22:00.235
<i>as ardent and sincere in this one thing.</i>

22:00.236 --> 22:01.945
<i>The time will come,</i>

22:01.946 --> 22:07.117
<i>the time will not be long in coming,
when new ties will be formed about you.</i>

22:07.118 --> 22:12.039
<i>The ties that will bind you
yet more tenderly and strongly</i>

22:12.040 --> 22:14.958
<i>to the home you so adorn.</i>

22:14.959 --> 22:19.046
<i>The dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you.</i>

22:19.047 --> 22:20.672
<i>Oh, Miss Manette,</i>

22:20.673 --> 22:25.052
<i>when the little picture of
a happy father's face looks up in yours...</i>

22:38.232 --> 22:40.234
Good evening.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.654
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Sean Jeffries.

22:44.655 --> 22:47.115
I'm the new deputy director
of communications.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.241
Where's Seth?

22:48.242 --> 22:52.162
Mr. Grayson got called away last minute,
so I'm temporarily filling his shoes.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.331
Uh, I...

22:54.332 --> 22:59.378
I won't be taking any questions. Instead,
I'll be reading from a prepared statement.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.089
A few hours ago,

23:02.090 --> 23:06.009
President Underwood resigned the office
of President of the United States.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.511
<i>And in a private ceremony
attended by staff,</i>

23:08.512 --> 23:11.639
<i>President Claire Underwood was sworn in.</i>

23:11.640 --> 23:14.101
<i>Effective immediately,
she will be assuming the office</i>

23:14.102 --> 23:16.270
<i>of President of the United States.</i>

23:17.021 --> 23:20.191
<i>- Details will be coming shortly...</i>
- You must be so proud of him.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.485
<i>And while President Francis Underwood
couldn't be here today...</i>

23:23.486 --> 23:25.862
Transfer of power happened
three hours ago,

23:25.863 --> 23:28.740
quote, "privately and quietly."

23:28.741 --> 23:30.200
And that's above the fold.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.285
- Anything from DOJ?
- Nothing yet.

23:32.286 --> 23:33.578
No official title to him,

23:33.579 --> 23:35.622
but it's Mark Usher
running the transition.

23:35.623 --> 23:39.792
Okay.
Let's find out who's in and who's out.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.628
The dominoes are falling.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.547
- Now, who's on Romero?
- Here.

23:44.215 --> 23:47.092
- We want the congressman on the record.
- I've got it.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.636
And let's save Macallan for the weekend.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.973
Tom, where are we with Doug Stamper?

23:52.723 --> 23:54.682
There's, uh, something I need to check on.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.311
<i>Slugline,</i> BuzzFeed, half the outlets
in this city are ready to jump on this.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.397
You spoke to him. One on one.

24:00.398 --> 24:03.816
- He didn't actually say he did it.
- He doesn't have to.

24:03.817 --> 24:07.404
Does anyone know what Seth Grayson
said to the US attorney?

24:09.991 --> 24:11.200
Tom?

24:14.661 --> 24:17.497
Two years you've been writing
about this administration.

24:17.498 --> 24:20.084
- This is it.
- I want to follow up, that's all.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.129
<i>I see a beautiful city</i>

24:24.130 --> 24:27.174
<i>and a brilliant people rising
from this abyss.</i>

24:27.175 --> 24:30.760
<i>And in their struggles to be truly free,</i>

24:30.761 --> 24:33.138
<i>in their triumphs and defeats,</i>

24:33.139 --> 24:35.307
<i>through long years to come,</i>

24:35.308 --> 24:39.144
<i>I see the evil of this time
and of the previous time</i>

24:39.145 --> 24:42.189
<i>of which this is the natural birth,</i>

24:42.190 --> 24:47.111
<i>gradually making expiation for itself
and wearing out.</i>

24:48.612 --> 24:51.030
Surface-to-surface missiles
delivered sarin

24:51.031 --> 24:53.533
at about three o'clock in the morning,
our time.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.744
Moscow has already issued a statement
condemning the rebels

24:56.745 --> 24:59.497
for orchestrating
the attack on themselves.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.625
- And did they?
- Of course not.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.046
Petrov will use this
to justify air strikes.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.257
I'd like to show you an image.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.433
This one is coming out of Reuters.

25:18.059 --> 25:21.395
The feeling is most of the press
will be using it by the a.m.

25:22.271 --> 25:26.192
Experience tells me this will resonate
for about three to five days...

25:27.151 --> 25:28.651
which gives us our window.

25:28.652 --> 25:32.614
- Well, we can ready a statement.
- Troops on the ground is the statement.

25:32.615 --> 25:36.451
No, I don't want to do anything
until we find Ahmadi's location.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.078
I'm not sure we should wait on this,
Madam President.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.706
I'd like to remind you
that it was this administration

25:41.707 --> 25:43.500
that introduced the ultimatum.

25:43.501 --> 25:46.669
- You should act on it.
- Yes, but I barely have a team in place.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.630
Well, you can run it
by the former president...

25:48.631 --> 25:50.382
The former president is just that.

25:50.383 --> 25:54.636
- An opportunity has presented itself.
- And I'm trying to take advantage of it.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.515
- Is everyone in the Situation Room?
- As of 20 minutes ago.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.527
So, the timing is bad.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.863
If you pardon him now,
you're associated with his crimes.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.782
Republicans will have a field day.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.160
We need some cover.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.869
Well, that would be
Ahmadi's capture.

26:19.870 --> 26:23.122
- The right VP would help all this.
- Have you had any further thoughts?

26:23.123 --> 26:26.626
My short list is the same.
Westervelt, Clark, Klein.

26:26.627 --> 26:30.129
Klein would be the strongest bulwark
against calls for your impeachment.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.132
- Swallowing poison to stay alive.
- Alive is good.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.470
I don't think I can stomach Klein.
He called me a bitch. I prefer Clark.

26:37.346 --> 26:41.975
Tell me. Before you moved the body,
were you able to close his eyes?

26:43.310 --> 26:44.311
Yes.

26:47.231 --> 26:51.193
Look... I know his opinion
means a lot to you.

26:52.403 --> 26:53.736
Francis.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.573
But having him here, in the White House,
even in the East Wing,

26:56.574 --> 26:58.617
while we're trying to figure this out,
it's hard.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.996
At some point, someone is going to imply
that he is still making the decisions.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.624
That wouldn't be good.

27:11.004 --> 27:14.090
- I'll advise her. She'll come around.
- I hope so.

27:14.091 --> 27:17.760
Because if she doesn't act now,
when it comes to Syria,

27:17.761 --> 27:20.055
her presidency could be in danger.

27:20.889 --> 27:25.101
- And your future in doubt.
- Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.936
I don't threaten.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.606
I just try to remain as clear as possible.

27:29.607 --> 27:33.527
You offered me your services,
and I offered you mine.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.738
You know...

27:37.906 --> 27:41.034
I was here before you
and I'll be here after you.

27:41.952 --> 27:45.247
And regardless of that,
let me remind you...

27:45.248 --> 27:48.625
that nothing is more dangerous than me.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.964
You need to be practical now.
Davis isn't wrong.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.050
We've been trying to get our hands
on Ahmadi for a year, Francis.

27:58.051 --> 28:01.137
- She hasn't delivered.
- Yes, but this isn't about her.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.724
This is about you and coming out
with a strong message

28:04.725 --> 28:07.226
in your first address to the nation.

28:07.227 --> 28:10.814
This is about setting the course
for your presidency.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.400
Be strong, Claire.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.069
Go to war.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.328
But I need you to leave.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.205
Leave the White House.

28:30.251 --> 28:31.752
Yes, I see.

28:37.173 --> 28:41.428
For this pardon to succeed, Francis,
we need to appear to be estranged.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.224
I'm just being strategic.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.810
And where do you suggest I go?

28:49.395 --> 28:50.812
I'm not sure.

28:52.981 --> 28:55.149
The Naval Observatory?

28:55.150 --> 28:58.152
Uh, I think the vice president's
residence is still too close.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.655
I'm sorry, I just...

29:00.572 --> 29:03.366
We can't have anyone think
you're still involved in policy.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.952
Look, if you're having second thoughts,
you should tell me now.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.162
- No. I'm in full agreement.
- 'Cause this is no time to hesitate.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.665
I am not hesitating.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.000
I just believe
if we don't play this correctly,

29:13.001 --> 29:14.544
as far as the public,

29:14.545 --> 29:18.465
my term will be nothing
but survival for both of us.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.176
All right.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.639
I want you to know I'm here if you need...

29:26.473 --> 29:31.978
any advice on policy or...
anything else you might need.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.983
Thank you. I'm going to bed.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.243
No one will ever love you as much as I do.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.121
I hope you know that.

29:51.748 --> 29:56.712
Just as I know that no one
will ever love me... like you.

31:56.122 --> 31:58.041
"Under the porcelain frog."

31:59.918 --> 32:03.672
The answers are case-sensitive and exact.
You won't get a second chance.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.802
- And the middle one?
- My favorite baseball player?

32:09.385 --> 32:11.638
"Wade Boggs." Two G's.

32:14.265 --> 32:18.687
And the last? "What did you leave
in that hotel room in Austin?"

32:21.356 --> 32:22.733
Where is my gun?

32:29.490 --> 32:30.782
Here you go.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.417
What guarantees do I have?

32:43.419 --> 32:45.005
I gave you your gun back.

32:48.634 --> 32:52.387
But what made you give it to him?
I'm curious.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.265
I thought he was in danger.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.603
And now you think what?

33:03.356 --> 33:05.567
That is what I'm asking.

33:07.611 --> 33:11.990
As long as I'm around,
you'll be a part of this administration.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.910
We both know too much about Aidan.

33:15.451 --> 33:18.705
And Claire knows how loyal you are.
I'm sure of it.

33:20.999 --> 33:25.587
So, what did you leave
in that hotel room in Austin?

33:30.341 --> 33:31.593
A bracelet.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.179
Oh, that's too bad.

33:39.350 --> 33:43.437
You know, I finally got a look at what
Macallan passed on to Ms. Harvey.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.607
I was shocked to realize the degree

33:45.608 --> 33:47.734
to which you and your husband
stole this election.

33:51.655 --> 33:54.782
I need to be honest with you.
I've been in talks with him about

33:54.783 --> 33:57.285
helping him start a foundation
of some kind.

33:57.911 --> 33:59.788
In exchange for influence over you.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.668
Interesting.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.800
I'm trying to help you
navigate this transition.

34:19.139 --> 34:20.601
Who are you to me?

34:23.103 --> 34:25.312
Who do you want me to be?

34:25.313 --> 34:26.940
That's not a good answer.

34:30.944 --> 34:34.947
You're the first woman President
of the United States.

34:34.947 --> 34:39.243
All you've had to swallow,
the sacrifices, the compromises.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.286
You're gonna want to isolate yourself.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.455
Not trust anyone.

34:43.456 --> 34:48.210
But that's exactly what you're gonna need.
Someone to tell you what's what.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.464
And is that person you?

34:55.927 --> 34:57.012
Is it?

34:57.596 --> 35:00.347
I don't think there's anything
I could say that would convince you

35:00.348 --> 35:01.683
if you don't already feel it.

35:03.852 --> 35:06.938
Ms. Davis,
you are asking me to start a war.

35:08.607 --> 35:12.026
And you seem to deliver on promises
when it suits you.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.738
So forgive me
if I question your intentions.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.784
I like you.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.994
I like being around you.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.375
And sometimes that makes me
less effective than I should be.

35:32.088 --> 35:37.093
Pardoning or not pardoning your husband,
in either case, he's a liability.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.222
If it's not treated properly...

35:42.265 --> 35:46.311
your husband's liver could fail him
at any time.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.981
It's not the kind of thing I could do.

35:51.191 --> 35:54.527
But I could find someone, or...

35:55.403 --> 36:00.532
I... I don't know if you realize, but...
even something like gelsemium

36:00.533 --> 36:04.079
can be lethal in higher doses.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.752
My husband's health is just fine.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.383
I'll continue to work with him.
Follow your lead.

36:21.722 --> 36:24.056
Here's my client's passport.

36:24.057 --> 36:27.184
- There's a few things we want to go over.
- That we haven't already?

36:27.185 --> 36:30.855
No cuffs, when you walk him out of here.
I need to be sure.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.734
Oh, come on, James,
we aren't gonna play that on this.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.236
You have some very good friends,
Mr. Stamper,

36:37.237 --> 36:39.072
to keep the press out of this.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.908
You will walk out of here
like a gentleman.

36:41.909 --> 36:44.952
We want him in front of the judge
within 12 hours.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.496
We don't even know
if we're gonna charge him yet.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.707
I did it.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.292
Let's get going.

36:55.255 --> 36:57.257
Who do you have on her cabinet?

36:58.174 --> 37:00.259
Right now, they're just suggestions.

37:00.260 --> 37:03.637
Oh, come on. We both know how this works.
You've already made your choices.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.348
You wouldn't be worth your salt
if you hadn't.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.226
I just want you to run them by me first.

37:08.935 --> 37:12.147
Look, I can make this transition
easy for you or not.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.108
And a word of advice.

37:16.109 --> 37:19.570
She's gonna need some friendly faces
looking at her across that table.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.613
There'll be a few...

37:21.572 --> 37:23.283
who will smile as required.

37:25.451 --> 37:26.828
Would you look at this?

37:30.999 --> 37:33.877
Both Special Forces. Former.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.296
They know how to forget,
so you don't have to worry about them.

37:39.632 --> 37:40.967
And the body?

37:43.344 --> 37:44.637
It's on ice.

37:48.308 --> 37:51.310
I just made contact with Nasser.

37:51.311 --> 37:54.105
We have secured the location of Ahmadi.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.316
- I'll assemble the team.
- I called Admiral Dale already.

37:57.317 --> 37:58.901
So we have some decisions to make.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.113
Once we have troops on the ground,
we'll need to take a close look

38:02.114 --> 38:04.240
at who we're considering for your cabinet.

38:04.241 --> 38:06.117
You'll need a team around you
with wartime experience.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.577
I have some suggestions
I've passed on to Mark.

38:08.578 --> 38:12.039
I think Deputy Director of the CIA,
Marcy Siegerson,

38:12.040 --> 38:16.418
would make a terrific Secretary of State.
Someone I could easily liaison with.

38:16.419 --> 38:20.547
Well, I was hoping that you would be
on my cabinet, in some capacity.

38:20.548 --> 38:24.093
I'll be operating out of the region.
It's where my strength lies.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.262
There are better people
who can take it from here,

38:26.263 --> 38:27.972
advise you on the home front.

38:27.973 --> 38:31.934
And Ms. Harvey, LeAnn,
we need to move you.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.020
Uh, just for now, of course.

38:34.021 --> 38:37.231
- It was my understanding that...
- Right now a more seasoned Chief of Staff

38:37.232 --> 38:40.443
would send a strong message to
the Congress and to the nation. For now.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.299
She'll do it. She'll send in the troops.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.343
I'll be in Dubai by tomorrow afternoon.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.012
And our deal stays in place.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.014
Yeah, hold on a second.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.266
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

39:16.604 --> 39:20.149
Yes. Ms. Harvey has her gun back.

39:20.150 --> 39:23.235
Macallan's files are with the president.

39:23.236 --> 39:26.864
Any hard evidence connecting you
to the election...

39:26.865 --> 39:28.491
<i>is in her hands.</i>

39:29.284 --> 39:31.411
Then LeAnn's job is done.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.877
If you have anything to say,
now is the time.

40:25.966 --> 40:27.633
What do you think happened?

40:29.677 --> 40:31.428
I'd prefer you tell me that.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.474
Humor me. You asked for this meeting.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.268
What do you think happened?

40:42.315 --> 40:44.025
I believe Zoe Barnes was investigating

40:44.026 --> 40:46.402
a relationship you were having
with Rachel Posner.

40:47.237 --> 40:50.072
And somehow, that knowledge would endanger

40:50.073 --> 40:54.535
Francis Underwood,
who you would do anything for.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.124
But did anyone think
about the life of Zoe Barnes?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.963
You know,
you think you can erase something.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.799
Then you find out that's not possible.

41:10.593 --> 41:14.222
Tom, my attorneys didn't even want me
to speak with you.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.724
I'm sorry,
there's just nothing more to say here.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.061
I don't know what happened
to Rachel Posner.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.523
But I don't believe you killed Zoe Barnes.

41:24.774 --> 41:27.110
Is this you in this video?

41:32.823 --> 41:34.325
Looks like me.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.675
I've thought long and hard, Francis.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.094
Barely slept.

41:53.969 --> 41:55.471
That's the job.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.476
I'm going to send in troops.
I'll be announcing it tomorrow night.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.064
I think you're doing the right thing.

42:07.067 --> 42:08.318
Do you hate it here?

42:09.069 --> 42:11.112
Oh, you know I don't like hotels.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.825
An approximation of home
just to remind you you're not there.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.705
Well, we don't live in a home.

42:21.872 --> 42:24.792
We live in a house,
borrowed and temporary.

42:28.671 --> 42:31.591
Something in your eye. A look.

42:32.425 --> 42:33.801
It's changed.

42:36.762 --> 42:39.057
We're the same now, you and I.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.017
- How so?
- You know how.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.771
It's been a long time
since I surprised myself.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.025
You'll recover.

42:51.319 --> 42:54.363
You're the most powerful woman
in the world, Claire.

42:54.364 --> 42:56.866
Comfort pales by comparison.

43:00.495 --> 43:03.830
I'll announce it during the speech,
after the troops.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.167
A full and unconditional pardon...

43:07.293 --> 43:10.212
for Francis Underwood and any crimes
he might have committed

43:10.213 --> 43:12.757
against the United States while president.

43:14.342 --> 43:15.926
I'm glad to hear that.

43:16.677 --> 43:20.806
It was never in doubt.
I just needed to think about how.

43:23.893 --> 43:26.687
So how long does this arrangement last?

43:26.688 --> 43:27.855
For the time being.

43:31.066 --> 43:33.527
How did we get here, Francis?

43:33.528 --> 43:35.863
Oh, let it go. It's done.

43:38.366 --> 43:39.992
Oh, and one word of advice.

43:40.701 --> 43:43.162
Whomever Usher offers up to you
as vice president,

43:43.163 --> 43:46.124
that's the person
that you're really gonna have to watch.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.503
I won't choose anyone I can't manage.

44:35.256 --> 44:37.466
<i>Southwest corner
of the building. Maintain visual.</i>

44:37.467 --> 44:38.551
<i>Copy that.</i>

44:39.302 --> 44:41.346
<i>Frag out!</i>

44:43.431 --> 44:45.266
<i>There's Ahmadi.
I have visual on Ahmadi.</i>

44:45.267 --> 44:47.434
<i>- I see him.
- Go, go! Fire!</i>

44:53.983 --> 44:55.776
I made a terrible mistake.

44:59.071 --> 45:00.823
What did you do?

45:01.782 --> 45:04.535
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
I, uh...

45:05.411 --> 45:08.581
This morning I started driving.
I... I got scared.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.585
Anyway, I'm on my way back.
Can I come see you?

45:13.586 --> 45:14.920
Yes, please.

45:53.376 --> 45:57.297
Sometimes you don't have to watch
the whole movie to know how it ends.

46:02.176 --> 46:04.595
The speech is gonna play well
with both parties.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.639
Where are we with the Republicans?

46:07.640 --> 46:09.642
Trading names
when it comes to your cabinet.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.394
We have our generals, which is good.

46:12.395 --> 46:16.440
Some corporate types, outsiders.
Make you seem like a renegade.

46:16.441 --> 46:17.942
Corporate, from where?

46:18.984 --> 46:21.987
Oil, banking, mostly. Some tech.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.865
Occasional D.C. lifer sprinkled
into the mix

46:24.866 --> 46:26.742
to make sure the trains run on time.

46:26.743 --> 46:28.827
I was going over our list
for vice president.

46:28.828 --> 46:30.162
Yeah. Hold on.

46:30.830 --> 46:33.874
Uh, this will seem unexpected,

46:33.875 --> 46:37.712
but a lot of the people
I spoke to suggested me.

46:42.675 --> 46:44.677
You're not a politician.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.345
Exactly.

46:47.346 --> 46:49.431
But I could be by your side.

46:49.432 --> 46:52.935
Most of the Hill and the Senate
would not come near us.

46:55.145 --> 46:58.608
- I'll take it into consideration.
- It's beyond that. You'll need me.

46:59.692 --> 47:01.026
Excuse me?

47:01.819 --> 47:03.654
I can help. Look...

47:04.655 --> 47:07.742
It is the way
to keep you in power.

47:09.369 --> 47:11.161
And keep your secrets.

47:22.382 --> 47:23.549
Good evening.

47:24.133 --> 47:28.094
I'm here to report to the American people
and the world

47:28.095 --> 47:33.851
that early this morning, Special Forces
killed the ICO terrorist Ahmed Al Ahmadi.

47:34.519 --> 47:35.811
We got him.

47:36.937 --> 47:38.188
We got him.

47:39.148 --> 47:41.983
Now, there comes a time
in every president's tenure

47:41.984 --> 47:46.112
when he or she must face the question
of whether or not

47:46.113 --> 47:49.450
to send young American soldiers
into harm's way.

47:50.325 --> 47:51.619
In my case...

47:52.244 --> 47:56.624
that time has fallen within
the very first days of my presidency.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.670
<i>Russian President Viktor Petrov
collaborated with the Chinese</i>

48:01.671 --> 48:04.965
<i>on illegal oil exploration in Antarctica.</i>

48:04.966 --> 48:08.218
<i>Recently, we have learned
that he has sent troops</i>

48:08.219 --> 48:10.471
<i>to fight alongside the Syrian regime,</i>

48:10.472 --> 48:13.765
<i>assisting them in the destruction
of the Syrian nation.</i>

48:13.766 --> 48:17.811
These forces are using chemical weapons
on their own people,

48:17.812 --> 48:22.483
torturing the opposition, and starving
huge segments of the population.

48:22.484 --> 48:24.735
The Syrians are a people besieged.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.446
Let them not also be forgotten.

48:28.447 --> 48:32.868
The time has come for our outrage
to be turned into action.

48:33.786 --> 48:37.372
Five months ago, my husband addressed
the House of Representatives

48:37.373 --> 48:40.751
and asked them to declare war on ICO.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.545
Congress failed him.

48:43.629 --> 48:45.506
Congress failed you.

48:46.466 --> 48:52.597
ICO extremists want democracy
and America itself to die a fiery death.

48:53.514 --> 48:56.141
We cannot allow that to happen.

48:56.142 --> 49:00.730
We can't wait for Congress any longer.
We gave Congress every chance.

49:01.522 --> 49:03.023
She isn't going to say it.

49:04.233 --> 49:07.611
Now, history judges every leader,
every president,

49:07.612 --> 49:10.906
by how he or she treats
his or her own people.

49:10.907 --> 49:15.952
A regime that would target hospitals,
refugee camps,

49:15.953 --> 49:21.458
schools or bread lines in order
to retain power must be confronted.

49:21.459 --> 49:26.964
A leader that would sacrifice the physical
and emotional well-being of his citizens,

49:27.798 --> 49:30.216
<i>that would treat his people as pawns,</i>

49:30.217 --> 49:33.595
just to stay in power? Well...

49:33.596 --> 49:36.724
that leader needs to be stopped.

49:39.644 --> 49:41.812
If she doesn't pardon me...

49:43.272 --> 49:44.524
I'll kill her.

49:46.191 --> 49:49.695
Thank you
and God bless this great country.

49:57.161 --> 49:59.537
Well, the calls are coming in already.

49:59.538 --> 50:01.623
Well done.
This'll be a good night for you.

50:01.624 --> 50:02.749
Nothing from Moscow yet.

50:02.750 --> 50:04.877
Right now I just need some time to myself.

50:10.507 --> 50:12.467
Do you know Tom Yates?

50:12.468 --> 50:14.385
Uh, not personally. Why?

50:14.386 --> 50:16.305
He hasn't been around in a while.

50:17.222 --> 50:18.766
I don't know, forget it.

50:19.684 --> 50:20.726
What?

50:20.727 --> 50:24.354
I've been calling him.
And he usually answers.

50:25.773 --> 50:28.358
We demand justice,
we demand peace!

50:28.359 --> 50:30.694
No more war in the Middle East!

50:30.695 --> 50:33.321
We demand justice, we demand peace!

50:33.322 --> 50:35.741
No more war in the Middle East!

50:35.742 --> 50:38.368
We demand justice, we demand peace!

50:38.369 --> 50:40.787
No more war in the Middle East!

50:40.788 --> 50:44.082
We demand justice, we demand peace...

50:44.083 --> 50:46.459
<i>The anti-war demonstrations
outside the White House</i>

50:46.460 --> 50:47.628
<i>finally got out of hand.</i>

50:47.629 --> 50:50.421
<i>You've reached
LeAnn Harvey. Please leave a message.</i>

50:50.422 --> 50:52.841
<i>One of the protesters
made his way over the gates.</i>

50:52.842 --> 50:54.885
<i>As he was running across
the White House lawn,</i>

50:54.886 --> 50:59.014
<i>Secret Service agents moved in,
tragically shooting and killing the man.</i>

51:07.106 --> 51:09.858
<i>You've reached
LeAnn Harvey. Please leave a message.</i>

51:09.859 --> 51:11.694
Hey, where are you?

51:45.895 --> 51:48.521

51:53.110 --> 51:55.487

- Yes, ma'am.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.031
My turn.
