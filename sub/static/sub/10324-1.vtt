00:02.102 --> 00:05.037
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

00:05.138 --> 00:07.698
<i>[Earl Narrating] Recently Randy had</i>
<i>become curious about hair dryers...</i>

00:07.807 --> 00:09.775
<i>so we borrowed one from Joy.</i>

00:09.876 --> 00:11.935
I really like the look, Earl,
but come on...

00:12.045 --> 00:16.641
- who has 30 minutes every morning
to spend on their hair?
- <i>## [Toy Xylophone]</i>

00:18.952 --> 00:21.147
You keep practicing, little buddy.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.223
I gave up the xylophone
and always regretted it.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.862
Lucky kid. Still got a shot
at bein' somebody.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.102
- What's going on, Joy?
- It's the grand reopening of Mystery Fun Land.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.400
These "Make-A-Wish" T-shirts will keep us
from having to wait in long lines.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.532
- I'm dying.
- I'm dying too.

00:42.642 --> 00:46.237
<i>I'm not goin'to the funeral, Earl.</i>
<i>Tiny coffins creep me out.</i>

00:46.346 --> 00:51.045
And you still owe me 45 cents from when I used
to live here. We need to settle up, pronto.

00:51.151 --> 00:54.143
They're not sick, Randy. Joy's just
taking advantage of Make-A-Wish.

00:54.254 --> 00:57.087
Hey, the kid two trailers down
got to go to Space Camp...

00:57.190 --> 00:59.090
once his sickle cell finally kicked in.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.160
Why should my kids suffer
just 'cause they're healthy?

01:01.261 --> 01:03.195
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I couldn't be toojudgmental.</i>

01:03.296 --> 01:06.459
<i>Few years back, I did a bad thing</i>
<i>to the Make-A-Wish people myself.</i>

01:06.566 --> 01:09.626
<i>It was late New Year's Eve,</i>
<i>and Randy drove home without me...</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:12.296
<i>on account of me accidentally</i>
<i>giving him a midnight kiss-</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:14.464
<i>which we still don't talk about.</i>

01:14.574 --> 01:18.408
<i>Walking wasn't working well,</i>
<i>but I found another means of transportation.</i>

01:18.511 --> 01:20.479
Whoa, that's a giant dog!

01:24.384 --> 01:26.750
You're goin' the wrong way!

01:26.853 --> 01:28.878
[Whinnies]

01:28.988 --> 01:32.014
<i>Next morning, I felt like</i>
<i>I'd been kicked in the head by a horse...</i>

01:32.125 --> 01:34.787
<i>which actually might've happened.</i>

01:34.894 --> 01:37.454
Make-A-Wish child Buddy Zaks
lost his wish today...

01:37.564 --> 01:41.762
when the pony he was to ride in the
New Year's Day parade was tragically stolen.

01:41.868 --> 01:46.931
<i>So well-wishers tried bravely</i>
<i>to salvage little Buddy's dream.</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:49.941
This sucks.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.910
This was Buddy's last chance
to ride in the parade...

01:53.012 --> 01:58.211
because while not all Make-A-Wish kids
are dying, this one is.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.344
Now here's Chick Dabney
with the weather.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.615
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>It was almost 10 years since Buddy died...</i>

02:03.723 --> 02:06.157
<i>so there wasn't much</i>
<i>I'd be able to do for him.</i>

02:06.259 --> 02:10.559
- <i>But I figured I'd try to do</i>
<i>something for his parents.</i>
- [Knocking]

02:10.663 --> 02:12.654
This is so cool.

02:12.765 --> 02:16.792
I wonder if getting tattoos hurts trees
as much as it does humans.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.505
Hello, uh, Mrs. Zaks?

02:20.607 --> 02:22.234
- Yes?
- A few years ago...

02:22.342 --> 02:25.402
I stole your son's Make-A-Wish pony,
and I'm here to make it up to him.

02:25.512 --> 02:30.643
I mean, not to him,
'cause he's, you know- an angel.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.017
What's up, bro?
You stole my pony?

02:40.126 --> 02:43.687
Buddy? L-I thought you were dead.
I saw you on the news.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.696
I know what happened.

02:45.798 --> 02:49.928
He made a wish to still be alive.
Why don't they all do that?

02:51.604 --> 02:54.698
<i>[Earl Narrating] After I told him</i>
<i>about my list, Buddy invited us in...</i>

02:54.807 --> 02:59.471
<i>and he explained how he had defied all</i>
<i>the doctors'expectations about him dying.</i>

02:59.579 --> 03:02.742
It may surprise you, but Camden
doesn't have the best doctors.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.545
I mean, I've had three watches
dropped in my body during surgery...

03:05.652 --> 03:07.552
and one of'em's still in there.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.953
- So I take it you're a movie buff?
- Hell, yeah.

03:11.057 --> 03:14.686
You spend 95% of your teen years in bed,
you're gonna watch some flicks.

03:14.794 --> 03:18.423
- What's your favorite movie?
- Oh, without a doubt, <i>2 The Max.</i>

03:18.531 --> 03:21.193
It's all action with Max Patrick:

03:21.301 --> 03:26.762
C.I.A. Agent, Navy SEAL, gigolo
and devoted family man.

03:26.873 --> 03:32.209
Watch as Max stops a terrorist from using
a giant robot squid to kill the president!

03:32.312 --> 03:35.372
Me and Randy love squid movies.
How'd we miss it?

03:35.481 --> 03:39.474
Wait, is that the one that started out
all boring with the Renï¿½e Zell-wager girl?

03:39.586 --> 03:41.486
'Cause we walked out of that thing.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.957
No, no, no, you didn't miss it, because
it hasn't been made yet. It's all up here.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.722
Uh, and in here.
And some of it's over here.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.493
- [Roars]
- Stop it!

03:56.002 --> 03:57.401
- Do it again.
- [Roars]

03:57.503 --> 04:00.028
Stop it!
Do it again.

04:00.139 --> 04:02.471
- [Shouts]
- Wait, wait, wait. Let me lick it.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.669
Oh. I like your brother.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.246
He likes you too.

04:08.348 --> 04:12.114
Wait a minute.
I like him, he likes me...

04:12.218 --> 04:15.619
we all like squids
and you owe me.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.622
<i>You know what we're gonna do?</i>

04:17.724 --> 04:21.750
We're gonna make this movie,
and it is gonna be awesome!

04:21.861 --> 04:24.295
- [Roars]
- Stop it!

04:24.397 --> 04:26.160
- Do it again.
- [Roars]

04:26.266 --> 04:30.430
- H-H-H-Hold on. Y-You're saying
we're gonna make a movie?
- <i>Yeah, don't worry.</i>

04:30.536 --> 04:32.800
I got plenty of books
on how to do it.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.738
And if you wanna cross me off your list,
you'll help me, man.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.106
- You could be the producer.
- Producer?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.441
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Look at me, Randy. I'm a producer.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.037
I know. I saw.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.208
Besides sounding cool,
what exactly does that mean?

04:45.318 --> 04:47.445
Oh, being a producer
is awesome, man.

04:47.553 --> 04:50.579
I mean, you get to pay for everything
and hire everybody...

04:50.690 --> 04:54.888
<i>and you get to make sure that everything</i>
<i>happens exactly like it looks up here.</i>

04:56.396 --> 05:01.231
Yeah, yeah, we-we could
absolutely make your movie. Or-

05:03.236 --> 05:06.467
- [Nickers]
- Nah, I want the movie.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.439
<i>[Earl Narrating] Buddy wanted each</i>
<i>person he cast to fit his artistic vision.</i>

05:14.547 --> 05:18.381
<i>For Max's wife, he wanted someone</i>

05:18.484 --> 05:22.045

05:24.624 --> 05:27.889

- Nice!
- <i>Check out this great suit</i>
<i>I found behind the motel.</i>

06:04.997 --> 06:08.865
I had to kick a litter of fresh cat babies
off it, but I left 'em my T-shirt.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.960
That's a sweet suit.

06:12.071 --> 06:15.871

<i>[Earl Narrating] Once we had our cast,</i>
<i>we started shootin'our movie.</i>

06:21.748 --> 06:26.481
Okay, so, uh, this is the scene where
the president first hears about the giant squid.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.486
Everybody know what to do?

06:28.588 --> 06:32.080
All right.
Lightning in a bottle, people!

06:35.495 --> 06:38.089
And... action!

06:38.197 --> 06:43.760
Mr. President, as per your request,
we are unfreezing Benedict Arnold...

06:43.870 --> 06:45.770
so you can punch him in the stomach.

06:45.872 --> 06:50.468
<i>While he thaws, the vice president</i>
<i>has an announcement.</i>

06:52.578 --> 06:56.036
[Deep Voice]
Mr. President, this fax just came in.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.641
New York City is under attack
by a giant squid.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.983
TheJoint Chief of Staff has
declared a state of emergency.

07:03.089 --> 07:07.958
He is requesting permission
to go to Death-Con Six.

07:10.196 --> 07:14.860
I didn't take this job to let our free land
be swallowed by some squid.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.298
- <i>Get me Max Patrick.</i>
- [Mouthing Words]

07:16.402 --> 07:19.997

from outside and react.

[Both Screaming]

07:22.108 --> 07:23.837
What in the tarnation was that?

07:23.943 --> 07:26.810
And then we cut to a shot of the squid outside.
Randy, you say-

07:26.913 --> 07:29.507
- I said get me Max Patrick, now!
- And then I enter.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.045
Did somebody say my name?

07:35.154 --> 07:37.554
[Together]
Ad-lib excitement!

07:37.657 --> 07:41.388
No. Cut! Cut!

07:41.494 --> 07:45.328
You don't say "Ad-lib excitement,"
you-you just act excited, like-

07:46.432 --> 07:49.299
We have a major problem here. Earl.

07:52.004 --> 07:54.973
Listen up-
Thanks. Thank you.

07:55.074 --> 07:59.841
Um, listen. Other than Randy,
who is awesome, um, everybody else stinks.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.506
These other actors-
Uh, Patty sounds like a transvestite...

08:02.615 --> 08:05.413
and-and Joy, she just keeps
looking right in the camera.

08:05.518 --> 08:09.181
So you gotta fix this.
I'll be in my trailer!

08:09.288 --> 08:12.348
Uh, don't worry.
I'll-I'll figure it out.

08:17.463 --> 08:22.765
Look, uh, Buddy isn't happy
with some of the performances.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.996
And-And, Joy, you gotta stop
looking at the camera.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.698
If I don't look at the camera,
how will the audience know I'm talking?

08:27.807 --> 08:29.707
He says Randy's
the only one who gets it.

08:29.809 --> 08:34.041
<i>Acting's easy. You just pretend to be</i>
<i>different people and then talk like that.</i>

08:34.145 --> 08:37.582
Joy should say,
"Mr. President, per your request...

08:37.683 --> 08:40.207
we're unfreezing Benedict Arnold
so you can punch him in the stomach."

08:40.318 --> 08:44.015
<i>And then Patty goes,</i>
<i>"Mr. President, this fax just arrived.</i>

<i>about movies is special effects can be tricky.</i>

thing that's gonna happen in the scene...

this is a '98 Civic, and it's got a spoiler.

<i>[Earl Narrating] What with the screaming</i>
<i>and people catching on fire and all...</i>

10:47.380 --> 10:49.348
<i>by the end of the week,</i>
<i>morale was pretty low.</i>

10:49.448 --> 10:51.643
Okay, so the president
and Max's wife...

10:51.751 --> 10:55.084
are trapped by squids on, uh,
the roof of the White House.

10:55.187 --> 10:57.280
And it's, like, "Woo,"
and they're all "Aah!"

10:57.390 --> 11:00.826
And then Max Patrick appears out
of nowhere, he saves the president...

11:00.926 --> 11:02.894
and blows up the squid
with his laser watch.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.896
Psshh! Boom!
It's gonna be awesome.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.365

- How's this not gonna look like crap?

11:09.468 --> 11:11.368
Look, guys, you gotta trust me.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.995
It's all gonna be done with special effects
and-and camera tricks.

But-But we only got one shot at this while
the-the sun is rocking that awesome gold color.

I have lived with this for too long,

36:08.466 --> 36:10.366
<i>the waitress at the diner.</i>

36:10.468 --> 36:12.402
<i>So we headed over</i>
<i>to give him one more chance.</i>

36:12.503 --> 36:14.403
You stay here.

36:14.505 --> 36:17.702
I think those other women would've been
game if I hadn't had my son with me.

36:17.808 --> 36:21.403
- I think you creeped 'em out a little.
- [Sighs]

36:21.512 --> 36:25.346
<i>[Earl Narrating] I wanted Dad to feel better,</i>
<i>but I was hoping he wouldn't find a girl.</i>

36:25.449 --> 36:27.713
<i>I was also hoping</i>
<i>he didn't get hit again...</i>

36:27.818 --> 36:31.549
<i>'cause he was out of socks,</i>
<i>and I'd been wearing mine for a week.</i>

36:34.458 --> 36:36.619
[Chuckles]

36:36.727 --> 36:38.627
She's coming out as soon
as she freshens up.

36:38.729 --> 36:41.721
I told you this was a slam dunk.
I'm running across the street for condoms.

36:41.832 --> 36:45.734
D-D-Da-Dad! Dad, wait.
We-We really should talk about this.

36:45.836 --> 36:48.999
L-I don't know if I'm cool
with this actually happening.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.777
- Patty?
- Hey, Earl.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.781
When did you start workin' here?

36:58.883 --> 37:01.579
A couple of months ago.
I had to pick up a second job.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.780
My hooking took a bit of hit when Bush
monkeyed with the Daylight Saving schedule.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.557
I'll be needing these for use this evening
with a young lady...

37:09.660 --> 37:12.629
who delivers on the promises
she makes with her eyes.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.494
I thought you needed
the largest kind we had.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.659
Just ring it up, pecker-tease.

37:17.768 --> 37:22.228
Listen, I just don't know that sex
with a hooker is what my dad's lookin' for.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.070
Not-Not that you're not great.
I've heard wonderful things.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.509
Thanks. Word of mouth
is very important in my line of work.

37:28.613 --> 37:32.140
It's right up there with eye contact
and concealing sores.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.617
Hello. I see you met my son.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.280
I just had to run across the street
for a few personal items.

37:38.389 --> 37:40.289
And a little something for you.

37:40.391 --> 37:43.019
Thank you.

37:43.127 --> 37:47.461
Oh, they have nuts in them. Oh, that's sweet,
but some of my clients have allergies...

37:47.565 --> 37:51.057
so I need to keep this
a peanut-free zone.

37:53.537 --> 37:55.937
Dad, Patty's a hooker.

37:56.040 --> 38:01.342
No, no, no, no, she's not. She's a waitress.
A waitress who flirts with me.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.969
Daytime hooker, nighttime waitress.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.140
Damn it! This was not how
this was supposed to work.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.310
It's not revenge sex
if I have to pay for it!

38:09.420 --> 38:12.719
If you change your mind,
sometimes I have coupons in the <i>PennySaver.</i>

38:12.823 --> 38:15.849
- It says "massage," but-
- I'm not changing my mind!

38:17.328 --> 38:20.855
All right, so the chicks didn't work out.
Forget the chicks.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.059
I say we go back to Clark Clark's,
but this time we bring a bat.

38:24.168 --> 38:26.102
We do it when his wife's at work.

38:26.203 --> 38:28.535
[Sobs]
Why'd she do this to me?

38:28.639 --> 38:32.200
Why'd she make me feel this way?
[Sobbing]

38:32.310 --> 38:35.746
<i>[Earl Narrating] There were two things</i>
<i>I could've sworn I'd never see with my own eyes:</i>

38:35.846 --> 38:39.839
<i>A real bear carrying a picnic basket</i>
<i>and my dad crying.</i>

38:39.950 --> 38:45.217
- <i>[Body Thudding]</i>
- <i>I was taught from a young age</i>
<i>that Hickey men don't cry.</i>

38:45.323 --> 38:48.656
Don't cry, or I'll give you
something to cry about.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.659
<i>And no matter what happened...</i>

38:50.761 --> 38:54.390
<i>he always made sure</i>
<i>I never saw him shed a tear.</i>

38:54.498 --> 38:57.899
- <i>[Sawing]</i>
- Ooh, damn it!

38:58.002 --> 39:02.166
Earl, go get me my reading glasses.
I have to look for my fingertip.

39:02.273 --> 39:06.471
<i>Whatever life dished out,</i>
<i>he always remained strong.</i>

39:06.577 --> 39:10.843
Well, my mom's dead.
Pass the corn.

39:10.948 --> 39:12.848
- [Sobbing]
- <i>A funny thing happens...</i>

39:12.950 --> 39:16.351
<i>when the man you look up to your whole</i>
<i>life breaks his own rules and cries.</i>

39:16.454 --> 39:19.890
- <i>It finally gives you permission to.</i>
- <i># I was all right #</i>

39:19.990 --> 39:22.220
- <i># For a while #</i>
- Everything with Joy happened so long ago...

39:22.326 --> 39:26.729
- <i># I could smile for a while #</i>
- but all this stuff with Mom makes it hurt again.

39:26.831 --> 39:29.322
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- <i># But I saw you last night #</i>

39:29.433 --> 39:32.630
- It's never gonna go away.
- <i># You held my hand so tight #</i>

39:32.737 --> 39:37.071
- <i>So we cried. Together.</i>
- <i># As you stopped to say hello #</i>

39:37.174 --> 39:39.665
- <i># You wished me well #</i>
- <i>We even tried talking about how we felt...</i>

39:39.777 --> 39:43.736
<i>which was hard for my dad</i>
<i>and the son he raised to ignore his feelings.</i>

39:43.848 --> 39:46.942
- <i># That I'd been crying #</i>
- It's like someone took out my stomach and-

39:47.051 --> 39:48.951
- I don't even know what.
- <i># Over you #</i>

39:49.053 --> 39:52.079
- Stomped on it. That's what it feels like.
- <i># Crying #</i>

39:52.189 --> 39:55.556
- Yeah, but not with a sneaker.
With something worse.
- <i># Over you #</i>

39:55.659 --> 39:57.490
- <i># Crying #</i>
- Like a golf shoe.

39:57.595 --> 40:00.257
- <i>## [Continues]</i>
- I don't know golf shoes. Are they heavy?

40:00.364 --> 40:02.389
No, but they got spikes on the bottoms.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.128
Oh, then yeah.
Yeah, that's what it feels like.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.297
- A golf shoe.
- Right.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.932
<i>[Earl Narrating] And the more honest</i>
<i>we were about how we felt...</i>

40:12.042 --> 40:15.341
- <i>the more honest we became about everything.</i>
- <i># Crying #</i>

40:15.446 --> 40:17.880
- <i># Crying #</i>
- If I just wouldn't have spent
so much time at work.

40:17.982 --> 40:20.314
- <i># Crying #</i>
- No. Do not blame yourself.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.114
- I will not stand here and let you blame yourself.
- <i># I'm crying #</i>

40:23.220 --> 40:25.120
I'm not saying what
they did wasn't wrong.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.918
- But I will say they're
not the only ones to blame.
- <i># Crying #</i>

40:28.025 --> 40:32.985
Okay, now you're bringing some stuff up
I'm not sure I'm ready to hear.

40:33.097 --> 40:37.295
<i>[Earl Narrating] After a whole night of crying</i>
<i>and more hugging than I'd like to admit...</i>

40:37.401 --> 40:39.460
<i>we discovered something unexpected.</i>

40:39.570 --> 40:42.903
[Sighs]
I think I feel better.

40:43.007 --> 40:45.339
- Me too.
- <i>## [Ends]</i>

40:54.385 --> 40:58.446
<i>#Upon my word</i>
<i>what does it mean #</i>

40:58.556 --> 41:01.889
<i>#Is it love or is it me #</i>

41:01.992 --> 41:03.926
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Anger's a heavy burden to carry...</i>

41:04.028 --> 41:07.794
<i>but Dad realized that revenge</i>
<i>didn't make it any lighter- forgiveness did.</i>

41:07.898 --> 41:10.799
<i>#Looking out #</i>

41:10.901 --> 41:16.840
<i>#To feeling free #</i>

41:19.143 --> 41:21.703
<i>And forgiveness lightened</i>
<i>the burden of guilt too.</i>

41:21.812 --> 41:25.111
<i>#I sit here lying in my bed #</i>

41:25.216 --> 41:29.050
<i>#Wondering what it was I said #</i>

41:29.153 --> 41:33.055
<i>#That made me think</i>
<i>I lost my head #</i>

41:33.157 --> 41:36.024
<i>#When I knew I lost #</i>

41:36.126 --> 41:40.324
<i>[Earl Narrating] And if it worked for Mom</i>
<i>and Dad, maybe it could work for me too.</i>

41:40.431 --> 41:44.060
Joy, I forgive you
for cheatin' on me.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.432
Good. 'Cause I'd do it
again in a heartbeat.

41:46.537 --> 41:49.438
Now move.
You're standin' in my light.

41:49.540 --> 41:53.533
<i>Forgiveness was a peaceful feeling.</i>
<i>I felt calm, more focused.</i>

41:53.644 --> 41:58.707
<i>I can't say if my words madeJoy feel the same,</i>
<i>but I like to think it might have.</i>

41:59.850 --> 42:03.411
I did it! I did it! Genius!

42:03.521 --> 42:05.421
<i>And maybe by forgiving her...</i>

42:05.523 --> 42:08.617
<i>I showed her that there's room in</i>
<i>your heart for things other than revenge.</i>

42:08.726 --> 42:12.253
<i>That sometimes it's far better</i>
<i>to give an eye than to take an eye.</i>

42:16.133 --> 42:18.795
- Thank you.
