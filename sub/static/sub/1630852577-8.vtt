00:06.000 --> 00:07.931
Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.620
You'll be starring
in The Daytona Wind.

00:10.689 --> 00:12.896
Maxine!

00:12.965 --> 00:16.172
Hoity-toity Davenports!

00:17.896 --> 00:20.586
Lady Camden.

00:20.655 --> 00:22.586
The performance was believable.
It was acting.

00:22.655 --> 00:23.655
Daya Betty.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.931
You did a really,
really good job.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.517
You all did
such an amazing job,

00:28.586 --> 00:31.448
this week
there are no bottoms.

00:31.517 --> 00:32.724
Oh, my God!

00:34.241 --> 00:36.379
Lady Camden.

00:36.448 --> 00:37.586
You're a winner, baby.

00:48.689 --> 00:51.000
Ooh!

00:51.068 --> 00:52.793
Girl, yes.

00:52.862 --> 00:55.103
I can't deny it.

00:55.172 --> 00:56.689
I am walking into the werkroom

00:56.758 --> 00:59.000
with a little spring
in my step

00:59.068 --> 01:01.034
as a newly crowned winner.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.827
I'm feeling on top
of the mothefucking world!

01:03.896 --> 01:05.724
Yes, bitch!

01:05.793 --> 01:08.689
How about that
motherfucking lip sync?

01:10.172 --> 01:11.965
Congrats, doll.

01:12.034 --> 01:15.620
I'm finally out
of the safe zone!

01:15.689 --> 01:19.379
I feel completely relit.

01:19.448 --> 01:21.862
I know I have something
to make it to the top,

01:21.931 --> 01:24.620
and now it, like, makes me
wanna fight even harder.

01:24.689 --> 01:26.862
All tea, I'm pissed that
I am not in the top two.

01:26.931 --> 01:29.137
Like, Camden deserved it.

01:29.206 --> 01:30.482
Daya?

01:32.206 --> 01:35.758
Well, bitches,
we are all still...

01:35.827 --> 01:38.068
-Yeah.
-It's the bigger picture.

01:38.137 --> 01:41.620
It's kind of insane
to hear RuPaul say yet again

01:41.689 --> 01:44.620
how freaking good we all are.

01:44.689 --> 01:46.517
To, like, get that validation

01:46.586 --> 01:48.448
that this season
is not a fucking joke.

01:48.517 --> 01:49.965
No.

01:50.034 --> 01:51.310
There's gonna be one challenge
we're all gonna bomb.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.655
You all go home.

01:54.724 --> 01:57.241
We're all safe
to slay another day.

01:57.310 --> 01:58.551
Let's fucking give them

01:58.620 --> 02:00.620
some more of this juice,
darling.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.068
Maxine!

02:08.862 --> 02:10.620
-How we feeling?
-I'm happy.

02:10.689 --> 02:12.275
I'm genuinely happy.

02:12.344 --> 02:14.586
I mean, all tea,
I wish I was in the top.

02:14.655 --> 02:16.310
I thought you were
gonna be in the top.

02:16.379 --> 02:18.344
But at the same time, like,

02:18.413 --> 02:20.068
I don't think I could have done
that lip sync today.

02:20.137 --> 02:21.758
I really don't after
what happened in Untucked.

02:21.827 --> 02:24.275
I didn't think I was
gonna talk about this.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.896
Before coming here,

02:25.965 --> 02:29.551
I was starting the process
of hormones

02:29.620 --> 02:31.172
and, like, about to start.

02:31.241 --> 02:34.068
I am trans.

02:35.103 --> 02:38.137
I'm very proud of you,
because that was hard.

02:38.206 --> 02:39.620
Yeah.

02:39.689 --> 02:41.862
I do feel, like, there's
a weight lifted off of my chest

02:41.931 --> 02:44.586
of, like, I'm not lying
about, like, who I am anymore.

02:44.655 --> 02:47.137
I'm just, like,
nervous about my dad,

02:47.206 --> 02:48.275
because when I just
came out as gay

02:48.344 --> 02:49.551
and as a drag queen,

02:49.620 --> 02:50.862
it wasn't the greatest thing.

02:50.931 --> 02:53.172
If your family loves you,
they'll accept you.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.068
Never feel like
you have to hide from us.

02:56.137 --> 03:00.241
The girls are
above and beyond supportive.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.827
Just opens the barriers

03:01.896 --> 03:04.689
and just gives me a clear line
of what I'm here to do,

03:04.758 --> 03:06.068
and just to be myself.

03:06.137 --> 03:07.344
I love you.

03:07.413 --> 03:10.689
Watching Jasmine blossom
into who she is,

03:10.758 --> 03:12.655
it really does touch my heart.

03:12.724 --> 03:14.586
Everyone has their opinion
on Jasmine,

03:14.655 --> 03:17.689
but no matter how you bicker
or argue,

03:17.758 --> 03:22.344
ultimately drag is about
bonding with your family.

03:22.413 --> 03:23.758
Girl, the only fur
I see, bitch,

03:23.827 --> 03:25.413
is the fur on your legs, bitch.

03:25.482 --> 03:26.827
-Where?

03:26.896 --> 03:28.103
Even though I'm about to go

03:28.172 --> 03:29.724
and start cutting
people's heads off, honey.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.172
You about
to get kicked, bitch.

03:31.241 --> 03:33.586
You about to get kicked
into next season.

03:33.655 --> 03:35.344
Give me the wipes, bitch,

03:35.413 --> 03:36.896
Okay.

03:36.965 --> 03:38.931
Give me the wipes!
Give me the wipes, bitch!

03:39.000 --> 03:40.068
Aah!

03:40.137 --> 03:42.275
Stupid bitch,
give me the wipes!

03:42.344 --> 03:44.724
Telling me I'm furry.

03:44.793 --> 03:47.172
Child.

03:51.827 --> 03:52.758
The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

03:52.827 --> 03:54.275
receives a one-year supply

03:54.344 --> 03:56.827
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

03:56.896 --> 04:02.137
and a grand prize of $100,000,
powered by Cash App.

04:02.206 --> 04:05.275
With extra-special guest judge
Alec Mapa.

04:14.448 --> 04:15.620
The Daytona Wind.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.655
-Wow!
-Ooh!

04:18.724 --> 04:20.586
It's a new day in the werkroom,

04:20.655 --> 04:22.931
and the competition
is heating up,

04:23.000 --> 04:24.655
which I know sounds,
like, cheesy to say.

04:24.724 --> 04:25.793
Like, it's heating up.

04:25.862 --> 04:27.586
But it's really true.

04:27.655 --> 04:30.344
We were all very friendly
for a long time,

04:30.413 --> 04:32.551
but there's that little edge
that we're all feeling now,

04:32.620 --> 04:34.965
where we're just kind of, like,
"Are you feeling it?

04:35.034 --> 04:36.000
Are you feeling it?"

04:36.068 --> 04:38.034
I've got a lot of friends,

04:38.103 --> 04:40.896
but I don't have
a single $100,000.

04:42.275 --> 04:43.241
Like, love you all.

04:43.310 --> 04:44.758
I will catch up after the show,

04:44.827 --> 04:47.137
but I did really want
to keep moving.

04:48.862 --> 04:50.241
Hello, hello, hello.

04:51.758 --> 04:52.689
Oh, shit.

04:52.758 --> 04:54.793
You're all still here?

04:54.862 --> 04:55.965
-Yes.
-Yes.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.655
You know,
drag is a sisterhood,

04:57.724 --> 04:59.275
and since the dawn of time,

04:59.344 --> 05:01.551
we've relied on each other

05:01.620 --> 05:04.517
to keep our feet on the ground.

05:04.586 --> 05:06.137
So for today's mini-challenge,

05:06.206 --> 05:07.655
in the grand tradition

05:07.724 --> 05:11.517
of the legendary documentary
Paris Is Burning...

05:11.586 --> 05:12.793
-Oh!
-Ooh!

05:12.862 --> 05:14.931
The library
is about to be open.

05:17.310 --> 05:18.758
Because reading is what?

05:18.827 --> 05:21.482
-Fundamental.
-Fundamental.

05:21.551 --> 05:24.103
I have been waiting
all season long for this.

05:24.172 --> 05:26.310
I love to talk shit.

05:26.379 --> 05:28.103
This is what I was born for.

05:28.172 --> 05:30.655
All right, first up,
Kerri Colby.

05:30.724 --> 05:32.517
-Ooh.
-Get ready.

05:34.103 --> 05:37.586
Miss Angeria. Now, you say
I can't take a shape, bitch.

05:37.655 --> 05:39.827
What shape is that,
Wendy Williams gotta pee?

05:41.896 --> 05:44.103
Miss Jasmine Mouth Almighty.

05:44.172 --> 05:46.862
You know, I am so glad
that on this whole journey,

05:46.931 --> 05:49.482
you have found...
your silence.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.862
Daya Betty,
con-drag-ulations, my dear.

05:54.931 --> 05:57.482
You are American's next...
Crystal Methyd.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.034
-Lady Cameltoe.

06:02.103 --> 06:03.965
Next time you wanna be
masculine on the runway,

06:04.034 --> 06:05.724
leave the mustache at home.

06:05.793 --> 06:07.862
Your jawline is enough.

06:10.344 --> 06:12.172
Little Miss Jorgeous.

06:12.241 --> 06:15.275
The tiniest little waist...

06:15.344 --> 06:16.758
of time.

06:19.482 --> 06:23.137
Miss Kerri Colby,
the face of a superstar...

06:23.206 --> 06:25.241
for podcasting.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.206
Miss Willow Pill.

06:29.275 --> 06:32.137
I'm a lady, but you,
you are a dame.

06:32.206 --> 06:35.793
A little dame, a little
Hunchback of Notre Dame.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.413
Quasimodo, she better do!

06:42.931 --> 06:45.517
Kerri Colby,
what can I say

06:45.586 --> 06:48.034
that RuPaul
already hasn't to you?

06:48.103 --> 06:50.862
Um...con-drag-ulations.

06:50.931 --> 06:53.206
You're the winner
of this week's maxi-challenge.

06:53.275 --> 06:59.310
Miss Angeria VanWinkle
Bower-Chapman III.

06:59.379 --> 07:02.413
Bitch, your name is longer
than a CVS receipt, ho.

07:03.758 --> 07:05.241
Miss Bosco, in drag,

07:05.310 --> 07:08.034
you're really this gorgeous,
beautiful burlesque woman.

07:08.103 --> 07:11.379
Outside of drag,
you give me greaseball.

07:13.482 --> 07:16.517
Jasmine Kennedie,
why do you look so old,

07:16.586 --> 07:17.793
but you are so young?

07:17.862 --> 07:20.896
You are the definition
of white do crack.

07:25.034 --> 07:27.137
You got me, bitch.

07:27.206 --> 07:28.413
-Kerri Colby.
-Hey.

07:28.482 --> 07:32.103
You are beautiful,
just like your mother.

07:32.172 --> 07:34.655
Too bad she didn't
pass down those dancing skills.

07:34.724 --> 07:36.344
It must have skipped
a generation.

07:38.137 --> 07:39.241
Daya Betty.

07:39.310 --> 07:41.862
I'm surprised
you're not a Gemini,

07:41.931 --> 07:43.241
'cause the whole two face act
you got going on

07:43.310 --> 07:45.724
could have fooled me.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.448
DeJa Skye, we know you're
always telling bad dad jokes

07:50.517 --> 07:51.724
in the werkroom.

07:51.793 --> 07:53.551
Though you may not be
a comedy queen,

07:53.620 --> 07:55.000
you certainly have
the face for it.

07:56.724 --> 07:58.241
Serena ChaCha.

08:00.793 --> 08:02.931
Jorgeous, we know you're skinny
and you need to eat,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.482
but unfortunately Orion's ass
is not on the food pyramid.

08:08.241 --> 08:10.758
According to Jasmine,
let me put my second face on.

08:12.689 --> 08:15.379
Jasmine,
you were in the bottom

08:15.448 --> 08:17.275
for the Glamazon runway.

08:17.344 --> 08:21.034
Was your inspiration
behind your outfit COVID-19?

08:21.103 --> 08:24.103
Because it was tired
and had a lack of taste.

08:24.172 --> 08:26.413
-Shit!
-DeJa Skye.

08:26.482 --> 08:30.241
You're like a really good
pair of socks.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.448
Soft, supportive,
full of cum.

08:37.448 --> 08:38.862
-Jasmine.
-Oh, God.

08:38.931 --> 08:42.137
You are one brain dead slut.

08:42.206 --> 08:43.620
-I am!

08:43.689 --> 08:46.137
You put the bottom
in lobotomy.

08:47.896 --> 08:50.620
Lady Camden. I've learned
so much from Lady Camden.

08:50.689 --> 08:53.310
Did you know in British,
"fag" means cigarette?

08:53.379 --> 08:54.517
-Oh.
-It's crazy.

08:54.586 --> 08:56.344
So could somebody
send this cigarette home?

08:58.103 --> 08:59.620
-Kerri Colby.
-Hi.

08:59.689 --> 09:01.862
Your face is so frozen

09:01.931 --> 09:04.172
that it just asked me,
do you wanna build a snowman?

09:04.241 --> 09:06.172
And finally,

09:06.241 --> 09:07.344
I was walking around backstage

09:07.413 --> 09:09.931
and actually found
RuPaul's will.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.931
You have some very weird
criteria in there.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.689
She wanted to be buried
on the catwalk,

09:15.758 --> 09:17.931
and she wanted all of you
to be her pall bearers.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.758
That way you could
let her down on the runway

09:19.827 --> 09:21.689
one last time.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.068
And what?

09:27.965 --> 09:30.482
Whoo!
Y'all some shady bitches.

09:30.551 --> 09:34.103
The library is closed
officially.

09:34.172 --> 09:38.068
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...

09:39.724 --> 09:42.689
Bosco.

09:42.758 --> 09:44.068
Aah!

09:44.137 --> 09:46.517
It was time
for the villain to win.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.793
Don't get it twisted.

09:47.862 --> 09:50.827
Lady Camden, you're
a very shady bitch, too.

09:50.896 --> 09:53.793
Now, Bosco,
you've won $2,500

09:53.862 --> 09:55.517
courtesy of Sweet Tarts.

09:55.586 --> 09:56.827
Sweet Tarts, thank you.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.724
And as a special treat
for the rest of you,

09:59.793 --> 10:03.103
we've got Sweet Tarts.

10:03.172 --> 10:06.655
Why be just one thing
when you can be both?

10:06.724 --> 10:08.724
Can I get an "amen"
up in here?

10:08.793 --> 10:10.482
-Amen!
-My girls.

10:10.551 --> 10:12.965
I hope you're all ready
for a hullabaloo,

10:13.034 --> 10:16.310
because I'm setting
the Drag Racetime machine

10:16.379 --> 10:19.586
to 1964,

10:19.655 --> 10:22.896
a time when girl groups
dominated the charts.

10:22.965 --> 10:25.931
Now, long before
Destiny's Child,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.724
'60s girl groups
were breaking racial barriers

10:29.793 --> 10:32.827
and making timeless hits
from the female point of view.

10:32.896 --> 10:34.896
So for this week's
maxi-challenge,

10:34.965 --> 10:37.034
you'll break into three groups,

10:37.103 --> 10:41.000
each performing
a brand-new retro hit.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.310
The Bad Boy Baby,
by the Shang-Ru-La's,

10:45.379 --> 10:47.862
He's My Baby
by the Ru-Nettes,

10:47.931 --> 10:52.551
and Baby Is Love
by the super duper Ru-Premes.

10:54.551 --> 10:56.965
Now, you need to write
your own unforgettable verses

10:57.034 --> 11:00.241
and come up with
your own group choreography.

11:00.310 --> 11:03.758
And in the spirit
of true girl power,

11:03.827 --> 11:07.068
I'm gonna let you form
your own groups.

11:09.655 --> 11:10.931
Feel free to use items

11:11.000 --> 11:12.689
provided by Snag Tights

11:12.758 --> 11:15.965
and hair provided by
Wigs and Grace.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.896
Dream Girls,
start your engines,

11:19.965 --> 11:22.413
and may the best drag queen win.

11:23.965 --> 11:26.379
Okay. Here,
I'll pass out the paper.

11:26.448 --> 11:28.862
-Get some Sweet Tarts.
-Sweet Tarts.

11:28.931 --> 11:30.241
Okay, do we wanna start
with the first one?

11:30.310 --> 11:32.965
We all sit around and listen
through all three tracks

11:33.034 --> 11:35.862
to see which one that we
gravitate towards the most.

11:35.931 --> 11:38.068
-Bad Boy Baby.
-Bitches, I want that.

11:38.137 --> 11:41.344
The hard thing is that
you wanna get the right song,

11:41.413 --> 11:43.517
but you also wanna work
with the right people.

11:43.586 --> 11:44.724
This could get messy.

11:44.793 --> 11:46.896
Okay, I'm just saying
right now, bitch,

11:46.965 --> 11:48.758
I want Bad Boy.

11:48.827 --> 11:50.758
-I want Bad Boy.
-Period, period.

11:53.482 --> 11:55.689
I want Bad Boy.
I want Bad Boy.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.275
There really isn't
a picking order.

11:57.344 --> 11:59.620
It's mainly just girls fighting

11:59.689 --> 12:01.862
and calling out what they want
left and right.

12:01.931 --> 12:04.379
Okay, shh.
Everyone go one by one.

12:04.448 --> 12:05.655
Let's go around in a circle.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.413
Okay, I'll start with me.
I want Bad Boy.

12:07.482 --> 12:08.931
-Period.
-I want Bad Boyperiod.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.551
Oh, I want
the Ru-Premes, bitch.

12:10.620 --> 12:12.448
I want the Ru-Premes, too.

12:12.517 --> 12:14.379
-I want Bad Boy.
-I want Ru-Premes.

12:14.448 --> 12:17.517
I want Bad Boy,
and I've been real quiet

12:17.586 --> 12:19.310
and always taking a backseat
when we're choosing stuff,

12:19.379 --> 12:20.793
so that's what I want.

12:20.862 --> 12:23.344
I definitely, definitely
want the Ru-Premes for sure.

12:23.413 --> 12:25.551
Am I the only one
that wants the Ru-Nettes?

12:25.620 --> 12:26.965
-Yeah.
-I guess so.

12:27.034 --> 12:28.379
Yes, you are indeed.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.241
I'll do the Ru-Nettes with you.

12:30.310 --> 12:31.586
You'll do the Ru-Nettes
with me? Okay.

12:31.655 --> 12:33.275
Well, someone needs to--

12:33.344 --> 12:34.827
someone needs to bow out
for something.

12:34.896 --> 12:36.724
I'm sticking to Bad Boy.
I'm not changing my mind.

12:36.793 --> 12:38.517
I am not changing my mind.

12:38.586 --> 12:39.862
Pretty much digging my claws
into Bad Boy, so...

12:39.931 --> 12:42.241
I am truly not
changing my mind on this one.

12:42.310 --> 12:43.413
Y'all gonna have to
rock, paper, scissors.

12:43.482 --> 12:45.827
-No, bitch.
-Yeah.

12:45.896 --> 12:47.965
Daya is just being
a little baby,

12:48.034 --> 12:50.310
like, I want this,
I want this.

12:50.379 --> 12:53.034
-Nobody's willing to sacrifice?
-I'm not.

12:54.517 --> 12:56.758
Damn, girl, y'all
some hard bitches, girls.

12:56.827 --> 12:58.965
-Damn!
-I am not changing.

12:59.034 --> 13:01.931
We're all just having
a stare-down.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.137
Like, who's gonna quit?
Who's gonna fold?

13:04.206 --> 13:05.310
At this point,
we're all, like,

13:05.379 --> 13:07.827
we have to get what we want

13:07.896 --> 13:09.413
or we might be going home.

13:11.172 --> 13:12.482
Coming up...

13:18.413 --> 13:19.655
She likes to watch.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.655
Oh, shit.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.275
We're all just having
a stare-down.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.793
Like, who's gonna fold?

13:34.448 --> 13:36.965
I'll be a team player
and just do the Ru-Nettes.

13:37.034 --> 13:37.965
That's fine, you know.

13:38.034 --> 13:38.965
Come on, team player.

13:39.034 --> 13:40.413
And if I go home,

13:40.482 --> 13:42.206
I'm gonna fuck y'all up,
bitch. No I'm just kidding.

13:42.275 --> 13:43.413
No, you ain't, girl.

13:43.482 --> 13:46.068
DeJa is doing
a little kumbaya-ing.

13:46.137 --> 13:48.103
She's taking the safe way out.

13:48.172 --> 13:50.068
I hope that the group
that she goes with

13:50.137 --> 13:52.344
ends up working well together.

13:52.413 --> 13:54.586
Actually, I don't hope that.

13:54.655 --> 13:56.034
-Let's go work.
-All right.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.344
Now it's time
to write our own lyrics

13:59.413 --> 14:00.931
choreograph our own numbers,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.206
and come up with

14:02.275 --> 14:05.724
completely distinct
characters for everyone.

14:05.793 --> 14:08.034
This is a hell of a challenge.

14:08.103 --> 14:09.758
I feel like we should,
like, approach this

14:09.827 --> 14:11.310
as, like, this could
potentially be,

14:11.379 --> 14:12.724
like, a group win.

14:12.793 --> 14:14.655
Like, I feel like a lot
of the other challenges

14:14.724 --> 14:16.310
that we've done recently
it's, like, singular.

14:16.379 --> 14:19.827
And we were all very...
you know, strong

14:19.896 --> 14:20.862
about wanting to be--

14:20.931 --> 14:23.275
I sound like such a bitch.

14:23.344 --> 14:25.275
I do, too, but at this point,
I don't really care.

14:25.344 --> 14:28.379
Should we kind of
formulate the lyrics together?

14:28.448 --> 14:30.034
Yeah, we need to
bounce off of each other.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.517
Start with who's this boy?
Where did we meet him?

14:32.586 --> 14:34.896
Drive-through,
the shake shop.

14:34.965 --> 14:36.275
The bathroom.
Maybe they were in a--

14:36.344 --> 14:37.655
Drive-in movie.

14:37.724 --> 14:40.413
What's when people go
on walks in the woods,

14:40.482 --> 14:42.551
what is that called? Um...

14:42.620 --> 14:43.586
Walking.
In the woods.

14:43.655 --> 14:44.931
No. No, no, no.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.172
It's, like, a gay thing.

14:46.241 --> 14:47.655
Hiking?

14:50.413 --> 14:51.482
Hiking?

14:51.551 --> 14:53.241
The gays love hiking.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.172
I have worked
with Willow and Bosco

14:55.241 --> 14:56.931
in the last challenge.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.103
We know how
to reference something,

14:59.172 --> 15:00.724
but still make it our own,

15:00.793 --> 15:02.965
and I think that's what makes
our team so strong.

15:03.034 --> 15:04.000
Cruising?

15:04.068 --> 15:05.758
-Cruising. Cruising.
-Yeah.

15:05.827 --> 15:07.448
All right, let's get into this.

15:07.517 --> 15:09.413
Yes. We got
The Ru-Nettes, bitches.

15:09.482 --> 15:11.517
We did,
and I'm so glad we did.

15:11.586 --> 15:12.793
Yes, honestly.

15:12.862 --> 15:15.137
I mean, it wasn't
my first choice.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.275
-Yes.
-Yeah.

15:16.344 --> 15:17.586
-I'm fine with it, though.
-Yeah.

15:17.655 --> 15:18.896
I'm a diplomatic person.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.724
I was like, y'all can have it.
Who cares?

15:20.793 --> 15:22.482
-Girl, they were feisty.
-They were pressed.

15:22.551 --> 15:24.724
-It's okay.
-Yeah, very pressed.

15:24.793 --> 15:25.931
I'm not worried about it.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.517
DeJa is taking this
like a champ,

15:27.586 --> 15:29.689
and she's saying fuck
The Shang-Ru-La's,

15:29.758 --> 15:32.206
and she is just, like,
I am a full Ru-Nette now.

15:32.275 --> 15:34.448
-Okay, so let's listen to this.
-Yes.

15:45.586 --> 15:47.344
Okay.

15:47.413 --> 15:51.137
I am realizing that Jasmine
can't sing a lick.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.413
Girl, they'll autotune it up.

16:02.482 --> 16:03.482
Right, right, right.

16:06.517 --> 16:07.793
First of all, y'all know

16:07.862 --> 16:10.413
The Supremes is RuPaul's
favorite music group.

16:10.482 --> 16:11.862
So that's a lot of pressure,

16:11.931 --> 16:13.896
but that's also a great
opportunity to excel here.

16:13.965 --> 16:17.827
I perform Diana Ross a lot,
like, in my regular act.

16:17.896 --> 16:20.551
I am, like, a fan, bitch.

16:20.620 --> 16:21.931
I been waiting to sing.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.862
I did wanna go, like,
a little churchy with it.

16:23.931 --> 16:25.758
I'm gonna end it on,
like, a higher note,

16:25.827 --> 16:27.689
and be like,

16:27.758 --> 16:28.724
I like that.

16:28.793 --> 16:31.275
The Ru-Premes is going to be

16:31.344 --> 16:32.758
a make it or break it moment.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.793
If we are all on board,
it's going to be epic.

16:34.862 --> 16:37.103
I will be expecting a Grammy.

16:37.172 --> 16:39.344
Good luck to the other
white bitches.

16:39.413 --> 16:42.068
Yeah, all those
white bitches, innit?

16:42.137 --> 16:44.310
All of them, darling.

16:46.793 --> 16:48.655
-Hey, y'all!
-Hi!

16:48.724 --> 16:51.275
It is recording time,

16:51.344 --> 16:55.413
and we are recording our song
in front of Michelle Visage.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.379
Say hi to David Steinberg.

16:57.448 --> 17:00.275
-Hello.
-He along with Erik Paparazzi

17:00.344 --> 17:02.517
have produced
and written this track.

17:02.586 --> 17:03.620
I'm excited.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.206
-Good. You should be.
-Yes.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.310
The Supremes were the most
successful female group.

17:08.379 --> 17:10.000
Seeing these women of color

17:10.068 --> 17:13.620
on TV in prime time
was a really big deal.

17:13.689 --> 17:15.793
-Yes.
-So, Angeria, you're up first.

17:15.862 --> 17:17.137
Yes.

17:17.206 --> 17:19.689
I know that Michelle
was in a singing group,

17:19.758 --> 17:22.310
so I am nervous boots.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.275
Cut. Cute.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.000
Ooh, okay.

17:34.068 --> 17:35.827
Here's the secret
to sounding like Diana Ross.

17:35.896 --> 17:37.862
When your mouth is at rest,

17:37.931 --> 17:40.275
it's wide open
and I can see your teeth.

17:40.344 --> 17:43.655
Open. Open bigger.

17:43.724 --> 17:45.620
All you can.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.896
Let's try one more time
like that.

17:50.172 --> 17:52.172
I feel like Angie
could easily win this,

17:52.241 --> 17:55.413
because she knows how
to sound like Diana Ross.

17:55.482 --> 17:56.862
She does impersonations of her,

17:56.931 --> 17:58.379
so I feel like they're
gonna eat her up.

18:03.344 --> 18:04.275
I think we got it.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.758
I feel so accomplished!

18:06.827 --> 18:08.689
Yes, Angie!

18:08.758 --> 18:11.655
Kerri, okay, baby doll,
what's the song about to you?

18:11.724 --> 18:14.965
To me, it's more about
expressing what my baby offers.

18:15.034 --> 18:16.275
That's why he's your baby.

18:16.344 --> 18:17.793
Yeah, that's why he's imaginary.

18:17.862 --> 18:20.275
Let's start.

18:26.068 --> 18:27.310
That was pitchy.

18:27.379 --> 18:28.931
Yeah, all of it was off.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Kerri has a nice voice,

18:32.068 --> 18:35.310
but maybe Kerri
hasn't sung in a while.

18:35.379 --> 18:36.758
Let's find the pitch.

18:40.655 --> 18:42.000
So stay there?
Don't go higher?

18:42.068 --> 18:43.896
Well, what were you doing?

18:47.413 --> 18:48.620
I'm always gonna go
for simpler.

19:00.275 --> 19:03.000
This time when we do it,
give me some character voice.

19:03.068 --> 19:04.310
Gimme some, like,
life in your voice.

19:04.379 --> 19:05.482
Don't worry about
just sounding pretty.

19:05.551 --> 19:07.172
I don't think that

19:07.241 --> 19:09.931
I'm completely up a creek
with no paddle,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.379
but I just don't know

19:12.448 --> 19:15.551
if I'm giving exactly
what they're looking for.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.413
Wait.

19:18.827 --> 19:20.310
So...

19:21.793 --> 19:25.689
Hello. Oh, my God,
it's The Shang-Ru-La's!

19:25.758 --> 19:27.620
I'm a little nervous.

19:27.689 --> 19:30.827
We are, like, channeling
this peppy '60s energy

19:30.896 --> 19:35.379
to talk about something,
like, a little bit bizarre.

19:35.448 --> 19:37.965
Fingers crossed Michelle is
smelling what we're stepping in.

19:38.034 --> 19:39.068
Let's see the character
you're gonna give us.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.137
Okay.

19:45.724 --> 19:47.965
She likes to watch.

19:49.344 --> 19:51.034
You dirty little vixen.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.551
I'm going for poet laureate

19:53.620 --> 19:55.241
if Drag Racesuperstar
doesn't work out.

19:55.310 --> 19:57.275
It's actually funny.
Your words are funny.

19:58.344 --> 20:00.551
Okay, Daya Betty.

20:00.620 --> 20:03.344
I know I can sing,
but it's been a while

20:03.413 --> 20:06.275
since I've lubricated
the pipes, you know?

20:06.344 --> 20:07.862
We'll start out
with your verse.

20:17.344 --> 20:18.896
"He looks like our uncle,
but we can't say no."

20:18.965 --> 20:20.862
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

20:20.931 --> 20:23.758
-Keep that character, okay?
-Okay.

20:29.586 --> 20:31.310
Watch out, Johnny!

20:33.068 --> 20:34.862
My big old man voice crack.

20:34.931 --> 20:36.965
-No, it's great.
-Thank you.

20:37.034 --> 20:38.862
Betty is on beat.

20:39.896 --> 20:41.344
Okay, pop quiz.

20:41.413 --> 20:44.000
What do you know
about The Ronettes?

20:44.068 --> 20:46.068
They are a sister
and cousin trio.

20:46.137 --> 20:47.275
Okay.

20:47.344 --> 20:50.310
They love their
lower cat eyes down.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.551
I love how you just paid
attention to the makeup.

20:54.103 --> 20:55.206
The thing is about
The Ronettes,

20:55.275 --> 20:56.517
they were produced
by Phil Spector

20:56.586 --> 20:57.931
and the Wall of Sound.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.586
So you're gonna hear
this big backing behind you.

21:00.655 --> 21:03.655
When Ronnie Spector sings,
her voice cuts through.

21:03.724 --> 21:04.655
Now, do any of you sing?

21:04.724 --> 21:06.241
No.

21:06.310 --> 21:08.379
Eew.

21:08.448 --> 21:10.586
I don't even know
if I can carry a note,

21:10.655 --> 21:14.931
so I'm going into this
reluctant,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.793
because I don't know
what I'm gonna sound like.

21:24.862 --> 21:26.103
Okay, cut.

21:26.172 --> 21:28.000
-That's actually not terrible.
-Okay.

21:28.068 --> 21:29.517
So we need crisp.

21:29.586 --> 21:32.931
That was very Ronnie.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.862
Can I do it without
the background vocals though?

21:34.931 --> 21:36.172
You wanna go solo
already, DeJa?

21:36.241 --> 21:38.931
She's already Beyoncé-ing
this group.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.448
No, she's Ronnie Spector-ing
this shit.

21:44.896 --> 21:46.620
Cut. That was cute.

21:46.689 --> 21:48.310
-Yeah, that was cute.
-I love that, DeJa.

21:48.379 --> 21:50.689
DeJa is killing it.

21:50.758 --> 21:51.965
She said she wasn't a singer,

21:52.034 --> 21:53.793
but I have a feeling

21:53.862 --> 21:56.758
she just wasn't
telling us the full tea.

22:03.137 --> 22:04.344
When Jorgeous starts singing,

22:04.413 --> 22:06.275
it is like nails
on a chalkboard.

22:06.344 --> 22:07.379
All tea.

22:11.586 --> 22:13.000
Okay.

22:13.068 --> 22:14.310
I love your energy.

22:14.379 --> 22:15.758
Okay.

22:15.827 --> 22:17.931
Help.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.172
You're rushing the lines.

22:20.241 --> 22:22.482
Just relax
and get in the groove.

22:22.551 --> 22:25.034
Because right now,
everything is really rushed.

22:25.103 --> 22:26.034
I say maybe we should do
line by line.

22:26.103 --> 22:27.172
Yeah.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.655
The day.
The day--

22:35.310 --> 22:37.482
I don't think Michelle's
liking what I'm giving,

22:37.551 --> 22:40.827
so I'm really struggling
right now.

22:46.310 --> 22:47.379
There's no "me-eht."

22:52.793 --> 22:54.034
Oh, my God, I keep on doing it.

22:54.103 --> 22:55.172
"Met" is one syllable.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.344
Me-et him.

22:56.413 --> 22:58.206
No, met hi-im.

22:58.275 --> 22:59.275
Oh, shit.

23:00.344 --> 23:01.965
She's pitchy, she's off-note,

23:02.034 --> 23:03.655
she doesn't know
what she's singing,

23:03.724 --> 23:05.413
her repetition's bad.

23:08.103 --> 23:10.862
Oh, fuck.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.655
Should we try to talk it?

23:12.724 --> 23:14.517
Uh...

23:16.758 --> 23:17.931
I'm nervous.

23:20.620 --> 23:21.896
Coming up...

23:21.965 --> 23:23.689
And then six, seven, eight.

23:23.758 --> 23:25.206
One more time with that one.

23:25.275 --> 23:26.206
Yeah.

23:26.275 --> 23:27.344
We stop here?

23:27.413 --> 23:30.931
Kerri is struggling
with the choreo.

23:31.000 --> 23:31.931
This is the chorus.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.379
Five, six, seven, eight.

23:34.448 --> 23:35.758
Ooh.

23:35.827 --> 23:36.862
Ooh, girl.

23:46.448 --> 23:48.448
All right, bitches,
here we go.

23:48.517 --> 23:51.137
It's finally time
to get into this choreography

23:51.206 --> 23:52.931
for the '60s girl group.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.896
I'm a choreographer by day,

23:54.965 --> 23:56.551
and I know that Jorgeous
and Jasmine

23:56.620 --> 23:58.172
are performers and dancers.

23:58.241 --> 24:01.344
So I feel like
we kind of have the edge

24:01.413 --> 24:02.448
over the other groups.

24:02.517 --> 24:04.034
I think we should do, like,

24:04.103 --> 24:08.413
a boom, tap, boom, tap,
boom, tap, boom, tap.

24:08.482 --> 24:10.068
When you're doing it, though,
think more just, like, relaxed.

24:10.137 --> 24:11.379
Relaxed. Okay.

24:11.448 --> 24:12.827
Because you're really,
like, straightening.

24:12.896 --> 24:14.655
Just kind of like a--just
relaxed kind of thing, yeah.

24:14.724 --> 24:16.965
Boom, tap, boom, tap.

24:17.034 --> 24:18.172
I know you got
that cheerleader in you,

24:18.241 --> 24:20.000
but don't be so like, huh, huh.

24:20.068 --> 24:22.862
Just be, like, more of--
like, break up your movements.

24:22.931 --> 24:24.482
-Don't be straight with it.
-Got it.

24:24.551 --> 24:26.482
So just be very,
like, break, break.

24:26.551 --> 24:28.379
Yeah, but you're still kind of
doing, like, tk, tk, tk.

24:28.448 --> 24:29.551
Just be, like, boom, boom.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.206
-More fluid with it.
-Yes.

24:31.275 --> 24:32.310
I think we should go
to the next part

24:32.379 --> 24:33.586
before we clean it up after.

24:33.655 --> 24:35.689
Pause.
Can we do it from the top?

24:35.758 --> 24:37.793
Because we need to get this.

24:37.862 --> 24:39.413
Okay.

24:39.482 --> 24:41.689
I noticed that Jorgie
and Jasmine

24:41.758 --> 24:43.724
are getting a little
frustrated with DeJa.

24:43.793 --> 24:46.310
When we--no, you're more,
like, be in the middle.

24:46.379 --> 24:47.931
No, like,
in the middle of this.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.275
And I'll be
more over here, just--

24:49.344 --> 24:51.551
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Don't be so stance here.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.103
Be more--
a little bit more open.

24:53.172 --> 24:54.344
DeJa is a cheer coach.

24:54.413 --> 24:55.758
Go back to where you were.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.103
And not only that,
she's a cheer coach for kids.

24:58.172 --> 25:01.931
So it's like,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.103
Yeah, that's a little
too theater to me.

25:03.172 --> 25:04.896
Just a little too...

25:04.965 --> 25:06.586
I don't think that's
gonna work too well

25:06.655 --> 25:09.068
on two 21-year-old divas.

25:09.137 --> 25:10.137
Okay, so are we feeling good?

25:10.206 --> 25:11.275
Next!

25:12.448 --> 25:14.034
Wilson Phillips is up.

25:14.103 --> 25:15.689
All right!

25:15.758 --> 25:18.034
I used to choreograph in Denver,

25:18.103 --> 25:19.896
but I didn't really
let anyone know

25:19.965 --> 25:22.034
that I used to do choreography

25:22.103 --> 25:25.206
because I don't
wanna have this loud bark

25:25.275 --> 25:26.793
and then a really weak bite.

25:26.862 --> 25:28.034
This will be a nice point
for myself,

25:28.103 --> 25:29.827
and then these for y'all.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.931
Do you wanna start
from the first verse?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.137
That's when you start
to step forward, yeah.

25:34.206 --> 25:36.931
Two, three, four and five,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.034
six, stares at me.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.827
The Shang-Ru-La's are really
turning it out in choreography.

25:44.896 --> 25:46.103
They're coming up with
some really cute stuff.

25:46.172 --> 25:47.344
I'm really enjoying
what they're doing,

25:47.413 --> 25:49.413
and I kind of wanna,
like, join in.

25:55.827 --> 25:57.482
Yeah.

25:57.551 --> 26:00.000
Ha, hold, hold.

26:00.068 --> 26:01.758
Girl.

26:03.517 --> 26:05.758
Yes, Willow.

26:05.827 --> 26:07.827
Willow is killing it.

26:07.896 --> 26:10.103
Willow must make a lot of money
at the casinos,

26:10.172 --> 26:12.965
because she keeps her cards
very close to her chest,

26:13.034 --> 26:16.172
and she don't want anybody
to know what she can do.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.413
All right, Supremes,

26:18.482 --> 26:21.448
we are living in simplicity
and beauty and elegance today.

26:21.517 --> 26:23.482
Although I'm not
a singer-songwriter,

26:23.551 --> 26:25.551
I am a choreographer,
so this is my opportunity

26:25.620 --> 26:27.068
to step in and make sure

26:27.137 --> 26:29.000
that our team
looks fucking brilliant.

26:29.068 --> 26:31.103
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.724
Now we're gonna go
right, left, right, left.

26:32.793 --> 26:34.068
-Mm-hmm.
-High, high, low, low.

26:34.137 --> 26:35.517
-Right and left.
-One, two, three, four.

26:35.586 --> 26:37.413
Right, left, that's it.

26:37.482 --> 26:39.655
Right, left.
I know that Kerri and Angie

26:39.724 --> 26:41.275
are not dancers, which is fine.

26:41.344 --> 26:43.482
So I'm making sure
that what we're doing

26:43.551 --> 26:45.896
is not gonna confuse them
or overwhelm them too much.

26:45.965 --> 26:50.379
I'm trying to just give us
mostly walking, mostly arms.

26:50.448 --> 26:52.482
Really trying
to make them feel comfortable

26:52.551 --> 26:55.448
and not let them get stressed
out about doing too much.

26:55.517 --> 26:57.655
Now turn, one and two, three.

26:57.724 --> 26:59.551
-And turn.
-That's it.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.655
And then just keep turning
to face the front.

27:01.724 --> 27:04.310
Okay. Now let me see you
do that again.

27:04.379 --> 27:07.448
-So if you--if I'm Angeria--

27:07.517 --> 27:10.103
Baby, I am not a dancer.
I got two right feet.

27:11.034 --> 27:12.620
Right.

27:16.758 --> 27:19.827
Like, I got two white feet.

27:19.896 --> 27:22.724
I might have two white feet.
I don't know.

27:22.793 --> 27:25.448
Because, you know, Black people
have more rhythm than I do,

27:25.517 --> 27:27.034
so I might have two white feet.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.689
And one and two
and three and four

27:29.758 --> 27:32.379
and five and six
and seven and eight.

27:34.344 --> 27:37.137
I know Camden is trying
to create choreography

27:37.206 --> 27:42.413
that caters to Angie and Kerri,
but it is a lot of this.

27:42.482 --> 27:46.034
Now we're going left
doing this. Whoo.

27:46.103 --> 27:49.379
Now we're going right
doing this. Whoo.

27:49.448 --> 27:51.137
Four and five, six.

27:51.206 --> 27:52.379
Now we do the fun
zhuzhie one.

27:52.448 --> 27:54.241
One, two, three, four,

27:54.310 --> 27:55.965
and next, six, seven, eight.

27:56.034 --> 27:57.482
-One more time with that one.
-Yeah.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.724
All right.

27:58.793 --> 28:00.241
One and two
and three and four.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.034
This is the chorus.

28:02.103 --> 28:03.206
Oh! And seven and eight.

28:03.275 --> 28:05.034
Oof.

28:05.103 --> 28:06.241
Ooh, girl.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.620
Kerri is struggling.

28:08.689 --> 28:10.000
And then we stop here?

28:10.068 --> 28:11.241
You know when you see
a car accident

28:11.310 --> 28:13.206
that goes very slow motion?

28:13.275 --> 28:15.655
That's what I feel like
I'm watching right now.

28:15.724 --> 28:16.758
Go, one, two--

28:16.827 --> 28:19.275
Wait, is mine playing?

28:19.344 --> 28:20.931
Oh.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.034
I'm a little worried about them,
because at the end of the day,

28:23.103 --> 28:26.137
that is RuPaul's
favorite girl group.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.965
We have a lot of work to do,
but we have something.

28:29.034 --> 28:31.068
Coming up...

28:31.137 --> 28:33.206
You had said
some things about me

28:33.275 --> 28:34.931
that you have not yet
said to my face.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.137
Well, you were busy trying
to lip sync for your life,

28:37.206 --> 28:38.275
so I didn't wanna bother you.

28:38.344 --> 28:39.793
-Oh!
-Oh!

28:39.862 --> 28:41.724
Girl.

28:50.620 --> 28:53.206
Whew!

28:53.275 --> 28:57.724
It is time to get ready for
our girl group performances,

28:57.793 --> 28:59.413
and, oh, I'm excited.

28:59.482 --> 29:01.620
I was born to be a Supreme.

29:01.689 --> 29:03.586
Ooh!

29:03.655 --> 29:05.758
So I know our challenge
this week

29:05.827 --> 29:07.931
was based off of,
like, '60s girl groups,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.344
but, like, who are some girl
groups that y'all listen to?

29:11.413 --> 29:13.620
My favorite is definitely
Destiny's Child.

29:13.689 --> 29:15.034
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:15.103 --> 29:17.137
-Danity Kane.
-Yes!

29:17.206 --> 29:18.965
Mine is absolutely 100%
the Spice Girls, for sure.

29:19.034 --> 29:20.275
Oh, shocker.

29:20.344 --> 29:22.586
I know I always talk about
the Spice Girls

29:22.655 --> 29:25.413
and how much I love them, but
it's more than just the music.

29:25.482 --> 29:27.482
Girl power
is a really fierce message

29:27.551 --> 29:29.413
that I would always
literally just think about

29:29.482 --> 29:32.482
whenever I was feeling, like,
bullied at school or whatever.

29:32.551 --> 29:34.103
Girl power was, like,
a little mantra

29:34.172 --> 29:37.034
of, like, I don't need much,
I just need my girls around me.

29:37.103 --> 29:38.586
I love that.

29:38.655 --> 29:41.931
I remember being heckled at
by idiots on the playground,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.241
and my girlfriends
would clap back with things,

29:45.310 --> 29:48.172
and it just made me feel
so protected.

29:48.241 --> 29:50.689
And that's sort of to me why
girl power is so important.

29:50.758 --> 29:52.551
I'ma take y'all
to a different place.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.310
Some of my favorite girl groups
are the En Vogues

29:55.379 --> 30:00.137
and the SWVs
and the Xscapes of the world.

30:00.206 --> 30:01.896
I always enjoyed
those girl groups,

30:01.965 --> 30:03.896
but, like, because of
how I was raised,

30:03.965 --> 30:06.206
I never grew up
listening to them.

30:06.275 --> 30:07.655
I would have got my ass beat
if I was caught.

30:07.724 --> 30:08.965
-Oh, really?
-Oh, my God.

30:09.034 --> 30:10.724
I used to hum Survivor,

30:10.793 --> 30:12.517
and I would literally
get spanked for it.

30:12.586 --> 30:13.724
Why?

30:13.793 --> 30:17.000
My mom was committed
to making sure

30:17.068 --> 30:19.413
that the Lord
was the focus of the house.

30:19.482 --> 30:23.000
As a child, I would see Beyoncé
or Destiny's Child,

30:23.068 --> 30:25.275
and I'd be like,
oh, my goodness.

30:25.344 --> 30:26.965
You could tell
they were just having fun,

30:27.034 --> 30:28.827
and for so much
of my earlier life,

30:28.896 --> 30:31.206
I felt so restricted
because I was, like,

30:31.275 --> 30:35.448
why am I not allowed
to be who I wanna be?

30:35.517 --> 30:36.965
Like, you couldn't listen
to, like,

30:37.034 --> 30:38.448
you know, like,
a certain kind of music?

30:38.517 --> 30:40.034
Absolutely not, it was--

30:40.103 --> 30:42.896
Secular, like, non-Christian
music was out the window.

30:42.965 --> 30:44.103
Oh, damn.

30:44.172 --> 30:45.275
We'd be, like,
in the mall or something,

30:45.344 --> 30:46.758
and, you know,
those songs are big,

30:46.827 --> 30:48.655
so they'd play, like,
the music videos in the mall.

30:48.724 --> 30:51.724
And, child, I would just stop
in the middle of the mall

30:51.793 --> 30:54.586
and be, like...

30:54.655 --> 30:57.103
I'd get my ear pulled so hard.

30:57.172 --> 30:58.448
Aw.

30:58.517 --> 31:00.793
But it just made me wanna
listen to them even more

31:00.862 --> 31:03.137
and, like, understand,
like, why I was so obsessed.

31:03.206 --> 31:04.793
When it's a sing-along,

31:04.862 --> 31:06.724
you know, everyone's
favorite Lil' Kim song,

31:06.793 --> 31:08.655
you will see me
in a corner bopping,

31:08.724 --> 31:10.034
but I won't know the words

31:10.103 --> 31:13.241
because I never grew up
listening to those words.

31:13.310 --> 31:15.482
So just be patient
with me, y'all,

31:15.551 --> 31:17.862
because I do come from
a very different place.

31:21.137 --> 31:22.310
Bosco, can we talk about you

31:22.379 --> 31:23.862
winning the fucking
reading challenge?

31:23.931 --> 31:25.137
Yeah!

31:25.206 --> 31:26.896
I feel really, really happy

31:26.965 --> 31:29.827
that my shit-talking skills
were seen and appreciated.

31:29.896 --> 31:32.379
Yeah, you slayed it.

31:32.448 --> 31:35.655
Also, Jasmine,
I do wanna know

31:35.724 --> 31:38.413
where your read for me
kind of stemmed from.

31:38.482 --> 31:40.000
Oh, well...

31:40.068 --> 31:43.793
I was a little shook by Jasmine
saying I was two-faced.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.689
What did I do to you?
I just need to know.

31:46.758 --> 31:50.896
I did hear in the Untuckedof
the Glamazon Prime challenge

31:50.965 --> 31:53.655
that you had said
some things about me

31:53.724 --> 31:55.724
that you have not yet said
to my face.

31:55.793 --> 31:57.758
-Well, child?
-Like what?

31:57.827 --> 32:02.068
Along the lines of I rely on
my body to sell a garment,

32:02.137 --> 32:06.172
and that skinny girls just rely
on the fact that they're skinny.

32:06.241 --> 32:07.448
Jasmine literally wrapped

32:07.517 --> 32:09.793
just fabric around her body
with a belt.

32:09.862 --> 32:11.172
It's just, like, so annoying

32:11.241 --> 32:12.689
when someone
has a perfect physique,

32:12.758 --> 32:14.206
and they can get away with

32:14.275 --> 32:16.068
wrapping a piece of fucking
fabric around their body.

32:16.137 --> 32:18.655
Yeah, I said that.

32:18.724 --> 32:19.862
I did.

32:19.931 --> 32:21.931
But it's not like
I didn't address it.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.827
I did say it,
and I did mention it later

32:23.896 --> 32:25.379
when I was talking to Jorgeous.

32:25.448 --> 32:27.000
Right, but not to me.

32:27.068 --> 32:30.206
Well, girl, you were busy trying
to lip sync for your life,

32:30.275 --> 32:31.758
so I didn't wanna bother you.

32:31.827 --> 32:34.103
-Oh!
-The girls are fighting.

32:34.172 --> 32:35.793
I've been very honest
how I feel about people,

32:35.862 --> 32:37.517
and I just thought
you would do the same.

32:37.586 --> 32:39.310
I have been honest, bitch.

32:39.379 --> 32:41.241
It's your body,
whatever, you know?

32:41.310 --> 32:42.827
But I wasn't shading you
on that.

32:42.896 --> 32:44.965
I was just shading you
because your outfit was bad.

32:45.034 --> 32:46.655
-Oh!
-Oh!

32:46.724 --> 32:48.724
Girl!

32:48.793 --> 32:52.862
Honestly, Daya is upset because
she hasn't won anything yet.

32:52.931 --> 32:55.310
But, girl, you weren't in
the top for that challenge

32:55.379 --> 32:58.275
because your shit
was wrinkled and it looked ugly.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.896
Period.

32:59.965 --> 33:02.655
I just wanted to know why you
read me like that. That's it.

33:02.724 --> 33:04.206
Right, and I just told you.

33:04.275 --> 33:06.482
Okay. Werk.

33:06.551 --> 33:07.896
She didn't apologize, though.

33:07.965 --> 33:09.241
She still didn't
freaking apologize.

33:09.310 --> 33:11.448
But I'm cool, calm,
and collected,

33:11.517 --> 33:14.655
because I'm not going to
let her throw me off my game.

33:14.724 --> 33:16.034
No tea, no shade.

33:16.103 --> 33:18.482
-No pink lemonade.
-No tea, but all shade.

33:18.551 --> 33:19.862
Whatever.

33:44.724 --> 33:47.172
Yas, tinsel town.

33:47.241 --> 33:50.241
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

33:50.310 --> 33:53.379
My love child, Michelle Visage.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.758
My world is empty
without you, Ru.

33:55.827 --> 33:57.482
My boyfriend's back,

33:57.551 --> 33:59.965
and it's style superstar
Carson Kressley.

34:00.034 --> 34:01.655
Shh, Ru, don't say anything.

34:01.724 --> 34:03.862
My wife and kids
watch this program.

34:03.931 --> 34:07.344
And he's so fine.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.310
Actor/comedian
Alec Mapa is here.

34:10.379 --> 34:12.241
Do-lang, do-lang.

34:12.310 --> 34:15.310
Hey, Ru, do you know what's my
favorite thing from the '60s

34:15.379 --> 34:16.655
that's still swinging?

34:16.724 --> 34:18.586
-No, what?
-My balls!

34:21.172 --> 34:22.724
This week
we challenged our queens

34:22.793 --> 34:26.793
to pay homage
to iconic '60s girl groups,

34:26.862 --> 34:30.103
and on the runway,
category is Heart On.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.275
Racers, start your engines,

34:33.344 --> 34:35.724
and may the best drag queen win.

34:36.793 --> 34:38.241
Coming up...

34:49.034 --> 34:51.965
Flashback, 1964.

34:52.034 --> 34:55.896
It's time to hear the sound
of young America.

34:55.965 --> 34:57.620
Now let the music play!

34:57.689 --> 35:02.689
Singing Bad Boy Baby,
it's The Shang-Ru-La's.

35:02.758 --> 35:06.655
Look over there.
Can you see our man?

35:06.724 --> 35:10.413
Actually, I don't.
I forgot my glasses.

35:10.482 --> 35:13.655
We see him everywhere we go.

35:13.724 --> 35:16.724
Wow, wow, wow,
he's our stalker.

36:15.103 --> 36:16.724
She likes to watch.

36:50.310 --> 36:51.724
Watch out, Johnny!

37:09.827 --> 37:13.344
Singing He's My Baby,
it's The Ru-Nettes.

37:24.793 --> 37:26.689
The day that I first met him.

37:28.172 --> 37:29.724
I knew that he was mine.

37:31.103 --> 37:32.413
Every time he goes away.

37:33.620 --> 37:36.206
He's always on my mind.

37:59.379 --> 38:01.310
I never knew I needed him.

38:01.379 --> 38:04.931
As I spend
these nights alone,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.931
I just want him so bad.

38:45.379 --> 38:48.103
I love him so much.

38:48.172 --> 38:50.000
I really do.

38:50.068 --> 38:52.655
What's it gonna take?

38:52.724 --> 38:55.620
I just want him
to notice me.

38:55.689 --> 38:58.379
And if he doesn't,
I may go insane.

38:58.448 --> 39:01.034
Come on, papi.

39:01.103 --> 39:02.896
Look into my eyes.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.103
Tell me you love me.

39:05.172 --> 39:07.586
Te quiero mucho.

39:34.068 --> 39:39.517
Singing Baby is Love,
it's the super duper Ru-Premes.

41:05.379 --> 41:09.827
My baby
is always number one.

41:09.896 --> 41:13.310
And my baby
compares to none.

41:13.379 --> 41:16.758
My baby
is cream of the crop.

41:28.931 --> 41:31.310
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

41:31.379 --> 41:33.172
Give it up
for The Shang-Ru-La's,

41:33.241 --> 41:35.655
The Ru-Nettes,
and we are The Ru-Premes.

41:35.724 --> 41:37.379
And remember,
if you don't have a baby,

41:37.448 --> 41:38.620
you can't have mine.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.551
Coming up...

41:54.620 --> 41:56.068
You nailed it.

41:56.137 --> 41:57.344
You understand what this is.

41:57.413 --> 41:59.310
The thing about
being a girl group is--

41:59.379 --> 42:01.517
Oh, she about to preach now.

42:01.586 --> 42:02.896
Oh, I'm gonna write this down.

42:13.655 --> 42:16.724
Category is Heart On.

42:16.793 --> 42:20.448
Up first, Wiwwow Piww. Ooh!

42:20.517 --> 42:21.758
Carson:
What a panty-dropper.

42:21.827 --> 42:24.620
I am scuttling
down this runway

42:24.689 --> 42:28.034
because I can barely move in
this tight heart thong dress.

42:28.103 --> 42:31.000
The top thong
is the Borat-style thong.

42:31.068 --> 42:34.448
I've got some briefs,
I've got some silky pajamas,

42:34.517 --> 42:37.241
and hair that looks like I
just got fucked in the woods.

42:37.310 --> 42:39.241
Ooh, girl, two thongs
don't make a right.

42:41.275 --> 42:43.172
Daya Betty.

42:43.241 --> 42:47.103
Boy, has JoJo Siwa grown up.

42:47.172 --> 42:50.896
I am giving the judges
cyberpunk love.

42:50.965 --> 42:55.275
I've got safety pins
going up and down my sleeves,

42:55.344 --> 42:57.241
and I am just
strutting my shit out

42:57.310 --> 42:59.482
feeling like a bad bitch.

42:59.551 --> 43:02.379
Why, I aorta!

43:02.448 --> 43:04.689
Aorta?
I don't even knowa.

43:06.482 --> 43:07.586
Bosco.

43:07.655 --> 43:09.344
Eat your heart.

43:09.413 --> 43:12.068
I'm giving you
vampiric mistress

43:12.137 --> 43:13.862
having a midnight snack.

43:13.931 --> 43:15.517
I feel like
it's a very bold move

43:15.586 --> 43:17.241
for drag queens
to wear all white.

43:17.310 --> 43:19.275
We have to pay a lot
in dry cleaning for this.

43:19.344 --> 43:21.517
I turn around and...

43:21.586 --> 43:23.586
-Ooh!
-Whoo!

43:23.655 --> 43:26.103
My hole winks at Michelle.

43:26.172 --> 43:28.586
Rooty-tooty, fresh and booty.

43:28.655 --> 43:31.620
Fangs up, ass out.
The judges are eating it.

43:31.689 --> 43:33.448
Carson:
Well, that fat ass reminds me,

43:33.517 --> 43:34.413
I need to take my Lipitor.

43:37.344 --> 43:38.655
DeJa Skye.

43:38.724 --> 43:40.103
You know, I like

43:40.172 --> 43:42.137
that she always wears
her heart on her shoulder.

43:43.758 --> 43:48.689
I am giving a complete
anime superhero fantasy.

43:48.758 --> 43:51.689
I have big, blue hair,
Dame Edna glasses,

43:51.758 --> 43:55.206
and this latex is hugging
every single curve

43:55.275 --> 43:56.758
of this big, beautiful bovine.

43:56.827 --> 43:58.931
Hey, Pulmonary Mary.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.172
Coronary?
When did I eat coronary?

44:05.482 --> 44:06.793
Jorgeous.

44:06.862 --> 44:09.862
Ahh, I love
a Power Puff Girl.

44:09.931 --> 44:10.965
Mm-hmm.

44:11.034 --> 44:12.103
Jorgeous:
You wanted heart, bitch,

44:12.172 --> 44:13.586
I will give you
a big-ass heart.

44:13.655 --> 44:14.862
I am wearing my heart wings

44:14.931 --> 44:17.103
with the ostrich feathers
on it,

44:17.172 --> 44:18.896
and I'm giving you
bra and panty

44:18.965 --> 44:20.689
because the bitch
could wear it.

44:20.758 --> 44:24.172
And you know how
the judges are reacting.

44:26.482 --> 44:28.689
Come on,
Arrhythmia Franklin.

44:30.965 --> 44:32.482
Jasmine Kennedie.

44:32.551 --> 44:36.275
These have always
brought me oxygenated blood.

44:39.137 --> 44:42.000
My inspiration for
the runway is from Hercules.

44:42.068 --> 44:46.275
I am Aphrodite, the goddess
of love and beauty.

44:46.344 --> 44:49.793
Nobody can tell me
this gown ain't right.

44:49.862 --> 44:52.448
My hair, you can't even tell
it's a wig, mama.

44:52.517 --> 44:56.517
I own the entire
cardiology department.

44:57.793 --> 45:00.758
Angeria
Paris VanMicheals.

45:00.827 --> 45:02.379
Oh, look.
That look is bangin'.

45:02.448 --> 45:08.310
I am a '60s Mod
Harajuku Barbie doll fantasy.

45:08.379 --> 45:10.275
And boom, there it is.

45:10.344 --> 45:12.689
I heart you.

45:12.758 --> 45:15.206
My look is fun, it's fantasy.

45:15.275 --> 45:18.206
I want the judges to see
that there's more to Angeria

45:18.275 --> 45:20.689
than just glamour
and pageantry.

45:20.758 --> 45:22.655
Wait a minute.
Sia is Black?

45:24.379 --> 45:25.896
Kerri Colby.

45:25.965 --> 45:28.551
This look makes
my heart skip a teat.

45:28.620 --> 45:31.551
Some people might say
I don't have much of a heart,

45:31.620 --> 45:35.172
but this is living proof
that I absolutely do have one,

45:35.241 --> 45:38.344
and I ripped it out
just for you to see.

45:38.413 --> 45:41.172
I'm definitely giving something
just a little bit twisted.

45:41.241 --> 45:43.206
Also, there are Louboutins
on the feet.

45:43.275 --> 45:44.965
Bloody shoes
for a bloody bitch.

45:45.034 --> 45:47.965
Come on,
deep vein thrombosis.

45:49.482 --> 45:51.310
Lady Camden.

45:51.379 --> 45:53.241
Okay, Cupid!

45:53.310 --> 45:55.827
Lady Camden:
I am feeling gorgeous

45:55.896 --> 45:59.241
in my Cupid struck
with her own arrows look.

45:59.310 --> 46:02.103
The arrows are sticking
through my heart

46:02.172 --> 46:04.068
because I've fallen
madly in love,

46:04.137 --> 46:06.137
and I cannot be saved.

46:06.206 --> 46:07.896
It's too late!
Go on without me!

46:07.965 --> 46:09.586
RuPaul:
Michelle, think twice

46:09.655 --> 46:13.034
before you sign up
for that archery class.

46:13.103 --> 46:15.103
I think her name
is Mildred Pierced.

46:18.517 --> 46:19.965
Coming up...

46:20.034 --> 46:21.000
This look tonight
is really pretty.

46:21.068 --> 46:22.172
I love this.

46:22.241 --> 46:24.000
In this challenge,

46:24.068 --> 46:25.655
you just weren't as good
as the others.

46:32.034 --> 46:33.862
Welcome, queens.

46:33.931 --> 46:36.758
This week
you competed as teams,

46:36.827 --> 46:40.000
but tonight you'll be judged
as individuals.

46:41.517 --> 46:43.827
When I call your name,
please step forward.

46:45.379 --> 46:47.517
Wiwwow Piww.

46:47.586 --> 46:48.896
Bosco.

46:48.965 --> 46:51.689
Jorgeous.

46:52.827 --> 46:54.724
You are safe.

46:56.551 --> 46:58.862
Ladies, you may leave the stage.

47:03.344 --> 47:07.310
Ladies, you represent the tops
and bottoms of the week.

47:07.379 --> 47:10.586
Now it's time for
the judges' critiques,

47:10.655 --> 47:12.862
starting with Daya Betty.

47:12.931 --> 47:16.206
You were in character
the entire time,

47:16.275 --> 47:18.724
and the thing about
being a girl group is--

47:18.793 --> 47:20.172
Oh, she about to preach now.

47:20.241 --> 47:22.482
-Oh, here it comes.
-You better write this down.

47:22.551 --> 47:25.034
You do all have to be together.

47:25.103 --> 47:28.689
But there's always one that
kind of grabs the limelight,

47:28.758 --> 47:30.965
and in your group,
I think it was you.

47:31.034 --> 47:32.275
Thank you.

47:32.344 --> 47:33.586
This look I love.

47:33.655 --> 47:35.620
You gave us something
a little bit unexpected.

47:35.689 --> 47:37.827
It's just a very fun,
updated version

47:37.896 --> 47:40.275
of what I would call
Club Kid couture.

47:40.344 --> 47:41.965
And there's a way
of doing things

47:42.034 --> 47:44.344
where if you do one wrong thing,

47:44.413 --> 47:47.448
it could look arts and crafty,
and you didn't do that.

47:47.517 --> 47:50.551
I'm so excited to see
the trajectory that you're on,

47:50.620 --> 47:53.034
because just when you needed to,

47:53.103 --> 47:55.068
you've hit the pedal
to the metal.

47:55.137 --> 47:57.000
Oh, thank you.

47:57.068 --> 48:00.206
Up next, DeJa Skye.

48:00.275 --> 48:02.482
When you all came in,
I said, okay, does anybody sing?

48:02.551 --> 48:03.827
And you all said, "Nope."

48:03.896 --> 48:06.379
And it's funny,
because DeJa, you can sing.

48:06.448 --> 48:07.586
Thank you.

48:07.655 --> 48:08.689
You gave us
that '60s glamour.

48:08.758 --> 48:11.034
You honored the brand,

48:11.103 --> 48:12.758
but then you brought
the drag sensibility:

48:12.827 --> 48:13.896
the humor, the camp.

48:13.965 --> 48:15.793
I think this look is adorable.

48:15.862 --> 48:18.379
This is different to anything
we've ever seen you in.

48:18.448 --> 48:19.655
I love the superhero vibe.

48:19.724 --> 48:22.137
I almost wanna go
further with it,

48:22.206 --> 48:24.931
with a thigh high boot
and an invisible plane.

48:26.931 --> 48:30.068
Up next, Jas-mine Kennedie.

48:30.137 --> 48:32.000
Hi!

48:32.068 --> 48:33.275
Singing my not be your forte.

48:33.344 --> 48:34.931
I think you were selling it
most of the time

48:35.000 --> 48:37.344
with joy and enthusiasm.

48:37.413 --> 48:38.862
And then
there were those moments

48:38.931 --> 48:41.586
where we could see,
you know, in your head,

48:41.655 --> 48:44.137
you were thinking, like,
do I turn here? Do I go there?

48:44.206 --> 48:46.896
I could see you thinking
about the dance steps

48:46.965 --> 48:48.689
instead of being the character.

48:48.758 --> 48:52.344
You never wanna make the viewer
uncomfortable or nervous,

48:52.413 --> 48:53.724
and I think
that's what's happening.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.448
I am such--
like, I'm a choreo girl.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.310
I, like, had it
for so many years,

48:59.379 --> 49:01.689
and, like, I just wanted
to hit it perfect.

49:01.758 --> 49:04.448
And I just, like, feel
like I let you guys down--

49:04.517 --> 49:05.965
-No, you didn't let us down--
-I know.

49:06.034 --> 49:08.137
It's just, like,
I harp on myself so much.

49:08.206 --> 49:09.241
I'm sorry to cut you off.

49:09.310 --> 49:11.827
It just, like...

49:11.896 --> 49:13.241
It was fun. It was fun.

49:13.310 --> 49:16.862
It just, you know,
in this challenge,

49:16.931 --> 49:18.241
you just weren't as good
as the others.

49:18.310 --> 49:20.310
Yeah. I understand.
Thank you so much.

49:20.379 --> 49:23.551
Up next, Angeria.

49:23.620 --> 49:26.103
The Supremes. It's the most
recognizable reference

49:26.172 --> 49:29.551
out of all the girl groups,
and you nailed it.

49:29.620 --> 49:33.655
The Supremes were my first
obsession musically.

49:33.724 --> 49:35.310
You sold it in a way

49:35.379 --> 49:38.586
that let us know
you understand what this is.

49:38.655 --> 49:42.172
This runway look,
first of all, I love the hair.

49:42.241 --> 49:44.482
I had that same cut
in the third grade.

49:45.655 --> 49:47.724
I like the color block.

49:47.793 --> 49:50.517
You're kind of giving me
'60s Cruella de Vil.

49:50.586 --> 49:52.655
-It's so much fun.
-Thank you.

49:52.724 --> 49:55.241
-Up next, Kerri Colby.
-Hello.

49:55.310 --> 49:57.689
We had some issues vocally,
but we figured it out.

49:57.758 --> 49:59.482
You ended up
sounding really great.

49:59.551 --> 50:01.551
But in the challenge,
there were moments

50:01.620 --> 50:05.034
where I was taken out
of Ru-Premes and into church.

50:05.103 --> 50:09.103
Sometimes it was so big
that it was very gospel,

50:09.172 --> 50:12.448
which I love,
but it wasn't The Ru-Premes.

50:12.517 --> 50:14.068
And lyrically, I thought

50:14.137 --> 50:17.379
you could have had more fun
with the lyrics,

50:17.448 --> 50:20.517
sort of the wink-wink,
nudge-nudge of it all.

50:20.586 --> 50:24.758
This is supposed to all be,
like, blood vessels, right?

50:24.827 --> 50:26.724
-Arteries, yeah.
-Okay.

50:26.793 --> 50:28.379
That's really
the fashion moment there,

50:28.448 --> 50:32.551
so I didn't need the necklace
or maybe even the gloves.

50:32.620 --> 50:34.758
I can't stand the fact
that I can see your pantyhose.

50:34.827 --> 50:36.482
Like, just pantyhose.

50:36.551 --> 50:39.517
I would have preferred it
even if you put a nude panty.

50:39.586 --> 50:41.344
Something over it.
That's all I was looking at.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.896
Your body's amazing,

50:42.965 --> 50:46.034
but I don't wanna walk away
just remembering your body.

50:46.103 --> 50:48.758
I wanna walk away
remembering you.

50:48.827 --> 50:51.206
Up next, Lady Camden.

50:51.275 --> 50:53.137
This look tonight
is really pretty.

50:53.206 --> 50:55.448
It borderlines on costumey.

50:55.517 --> 50:57.655
I love costumes.
I love this.

50:57.724 --> 51:00.620
The proportions are great,
it looks great, you sold it.

51:00.689 --> 51:02.206
In the girl group,

51:02.275 --> 51:04.448
I thought your voice
sounded nice on the recording.

51:04.517 --> 51:06.379
But with your performance,

51:06.448 --> 51:08.689
find those moments where
you can really be the star.

51:08.758 --> 51:12.931
I think your softness
and your shyness

51:13.000 --> 51:14.344
will affect you
in this competition.

51:14.413 --> 51:16.275
You need to find your spotlight.

51:16.344 --> 51:17.931
You don't wanna fade
into the background.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.862
You hit last week
out of the park.

51:20.931 --> 51:22.931
In the challenge,
in the runway,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.275
and in the lip sync,
amazing.

51:25.344 --> 51:26.862
Whatever you were doing
with that,

51:26.931 --> 51:29.517
apply it to everything.

51:31.344 --> 51:33.344
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

51:33.413 --> 51:36.068
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

51:36.137 --> 51:38.068
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:39.379 --> 51:42.137
Okay, now, just between
us squirrelettes,

51:42.206 --> 51:43.586
what do you think?

51:43.655 --> 51:46.275
Starting with Daya Betty.

51:46.344 --> 51:49.448
She nailed it, and it wasn't
just her vocal prowess.

51:49.517 --> 51:51.413
She had the right attitude.

51:51.482 --> 51:56.034
Yeah, she really understood
who The Shang-Ru-La's were.

51:56.103 --> 51:57.931
Those were the bad girls,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.241
and her lyrics were
nihilistic and weird.

52:00.310 --> 52:05.896
Yeah, in these last two weeks,
Daya Betty has come to play.

52:05.965 --> 52:07.034
DeJa Skye.

52:07.103 --> 52:09.103
She came in to record, you guys,

52:09.172 --> 52:11.206
and she said, "No,
I don't know how to sing."

52:11.275 --> 52:14.241
And then she opened her mouth
and was, like,

52:14.310 --> 52:16.793
And then this runway look,
there were some fit issues,

52:16.862 --> 52:18.931
but I think overall it was fun.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.103
It wasn't my favorite look,

52:20.172 --> 52:21.551
but at this point
in the competition,

52:21.620 --> 52:24.689
you have to keep switching it up
to keep our interest,

52:24.758 --> 52:27.000
and that's exactly
what DeJa did.

52:27.068 --> 52:29.724
All right, next up
we've got Jasmine Kennedie.

52:29.793 --> 52:30.896
In the girl group challenge,

52:30.965 --> 52:32.965
yeah, it was
a rocky performance.

52:33.034 --> 52:34.655
I know she's a dancer,

52:34.724 --> 52:36.379
but the choreography
looked a little clunky,

52:36.448 --> 52:37.931
like she might topple over.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.103
It was weird, right?

52:39.172 --> 52:41.827
While I didn't heart
this runway look,

52:41.896 --> 52:44.068
it was okay,
it was pretty.

52:44.137 --> 52:45.275
If those hearts had opened up

52:45.344 --> 52:46.344
and there was
something in there...

52:48.000 --> 52:51.137
Like airline liquor bottles,
or if a bird flew out of it.

52:51.206 --> 52:52.758
-Yeah!
-Live butterflies.

52:52.827 --> 52:55.275
Well, actually, that doesn't
work out too well on this show.

52:55.344 --> 52:56.482
Angeria.

52:56.551 --> 52:58.827
Her vocals were really fun.

52:58.896 --> 53:00.551
I thought she delivered them
really well.

53:00.620 --> 53:02.965
But what she really knew
better than anybody

53:03.034 --> 53:05.172
was how to be a Ru-Preme.

53:05.241 --> 53:08.517
That sort of carefree feeling
that The Supremes had,

53:08.586 --> 53:10.068
she got that.

53:10.137 --> 53:12.517
On the runway,
maybe a little literal.

53:12.586 --> 53:14.793
It was called
Heart On challenge,

53:14.862 --> 53:17.137
and she had a heart
on her chest.

53:17.206 --> 53:18.344
But when she came around
the corner,

53:18.413 --> 53:19.758
I was like, "Who is that?"

53:19.827 --> 53:21.827
We've never seen Angeria
in anything like that.

53:21.896 --> 53:24.689
This is what the pageant girls
know how to do.

53:24.758 --> 53:28.413
They know when to switch it up
and how to switch it up.

53:28.482 --> 53:29.896
Kerri Colby.

53:29.965 --> 53:33.482
In the performance, Kerri
lacked what Angeria possessed,

53:33.551 --> 53:35.344
which was that airiness,
that lightness.

53:35.413 --> 53:36.862
Her body was kind of forward,

53:36.931 --> 53:39.793
and Angeria was standing
straight up, up and down,

53:39.862 --> 53:41.827
like Diana Ross used to.

53:41.896 --> 53:42.931
And the simple adjustment
from this to this

53:43.000 --> 53:44.310
would have elevated it.

53:44.379 --> 53:48.068
And then on the runway,
it was a super chic idea.

53:48.137 --> 53:49.379
Yeah, unfortunately,

53:49.448 --> 53:51.931
the focus turned out to be
on the waistband,

53:52.000 --> 53:55.827
which is the wrong place to
have the focus on your outfit.

53:55.896 --> 53:58.448
All right, let's move on down
to Lady Camden.

53:58.517 --> 54:01.482
I thought this runway look
was really pretty.

54:01.551 --> 54:02.758
Not the most inventive.

54:02.827 --> 54:04.344
I think the arrows
may have been too big,

54:04.413 --> 54:07.965
because it took away from
the Greek beauty of the outfit,

54:08.034 --> 54:09.275
the silhouette.

54:09.344 --> 54:11.551
Girl group challenge,
I lost her there.

54:11.620 --> 54:12.896
She faded to the background.

54:12.965 --> 54:14.275
I can't even tell you
what she looked like.

54:14.344 --> 54:15.517
Was her hair blonde?
Was it brunette?

54:15.586 --> 54:16.862
I don't remember.

54:16.931 --> 54:18.310
Right now, I'm just
losing her in the mix,

54:18.379 --> 54:20.275
and I don't want to do that.

54:20.344 --> 54:21.827
Silence!

54:25.275 --> 54:27.586
I have forgotten my line.

54:29.620 --> 54:32.931
I've only been doing it
for 13 years!

54:33.000 --> 54:35.551
Bring back my girls.

54:40.965 --> 54:43.931
Welcome back, ladies.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.379
I've made some decisions.

54:47.931 --> 54:50.620
Daya Betty,
you're a bad girl, baby,

54:50.689 --> 54:53.000
and we like it that way.

54:54.586 --> 54:55.793
Con-drag-ulations.

54:55.862 --> 54:57.206
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

54:59.448 --> 55:04.413
You've won a cash prize of
$5,000 courtesy of Snag Tights.

55:04.482 --> 55:05.758
-Yes!
-Yes!

55:05.827 --> 55:07.068
Thank you guys so much.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.068
I just won my first challenge.

55:10.137 --> 55:12.827
I feel like
I'm blacking out right now.

55:14.448 --> 55:18.103
Angeria and DeJa, good work.

55:18.172 --> 55:19.586
You're both safe.

55:19.655 --> 55:22.517
-Yes!
-You may join the other girls.

55:22.586 --> 55:23.620
Thank you, guys.

55:27.206 --> 55:31.137
Jasmine Kennedie.
You're a tasty queen,

55:31.206 --> 55:35.000
but your performance
lacked spice, girl.

55:36.172 --> 55:39.103
Kerri Colby.
You're a beautiful queen,

55:39.172 --> 55:42.793
but your performance
was not a dream, girl.

55:44.137 --> 55:47.827
Lady Camden.
You are a supreme queen,

55:47.896 --> 55:51.793
but this week, you didn't
keep me hanging on.

55:57.034 --> 56:00.103
Lady Camden, you're safe.

56:04.586 --> 56:05.896
Thank you so much.

56:05.965 --> 56:07.724
I will not let you down
next week.

56:07.793 --> 56:09.551
You may join the other girls.

56:12.448 --> 56:13.827
I love you.

56:16.724 --> 56:19.034
Jasmine, Kerri,
I'm sorry, my dears,

56:19.103 --> 56:21.862
but you're up for elimination.

56:22.931 --> 56:24.931
I'm devastated,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.379
because I don't wanna
lip sync against Kerri.

56:27.448 --> 56:31.724
Two queens stand before me.

56:31.793 --> 56:36.689
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

56:36.758 --> 56:41.724
and save yourself
from elimination.

56:43.896 --> 56:45.931
The time has come...

56:46.000 --> 56:48.517
for you to lip sync...

56:48.586 --> 56:53.034
for your life!

56:55.655 --> 56:59.000
Lip syncing against Jasmine
is absolutely heartbreaking.

56:59.068 --> 57:02.655
But at the same token,
I'm totally feeling ready

57:02.724 --> 57:04.482
to slay the hell
out of this lip sync,

57:04.551 --> 57:08.172
because I wanna make sure
that I do not go home.

57:08.241 --> 57:13.655
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.586
Jasmine shoe has left
the building.

57:49.655 --> 57:53.172
Baby, this lady is lip syncing
with one shoe on.

59:15.931 --> 59:17.551
Oh, my God.

59:19.551 --> 59:22.310
Ladies, I've made my decision.

59:29.896 --> 59:33.241
Jasmine Kennedie,
shantay you stay.

59:35.344 --> 59:36.517
Thank you.

59:38.275 --> 59:40.172
I love you so much.

59:48.379 --> 59:50.896
Kerri Colby.

59:52.206 --> 59:56.344
Your fate now rests in the hands
of the drag gods.

59:58.241 --> 1:00:02.000
If you have the gold bar,
you will be saved.

1:00:04.379 --> 1:00:06.206
Now let's see whatcha got.

1:00:19.241 --> 1:00:21.620
It is chocolate.

1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:28.620
Kerri Colby Carrington
Dexter Morelle,

1:00:28.689 --> 1:00:32.413
forever may your dynasty reign.

1:00:32.482 --> 1:00:36.724
Now sashay away.

1:00:36.793 --> 1:00:38.896
I love you so much.

1:00:38.965 --> 1:00:41.482
I love you, twin.

1:00:41.551 --> 1:00:44.172
-I love you!
-I'm so sorry.

1:00:44.241 --> 1:00:46.793
Well, I'm Kerri Colby,
and all I can say is

1:00:46.862 --> 1:00:50.482
I'm so proud to be a part
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

1:00:53.758 --> 1:00:57.482
I feel a little sad,
but also accomplished.

1:00:57.551 --> 1:01:00.000
I learned that
there's so much more to me

1:01:00.068 --> 1:01:01.896
than the things
that I've always put

1:01:01.965 --> 1:01:03.793
so much pressure on myself for.

1:01:03.862 --> 1:01:07.551
I've been able to really
become a lot more vulnerable,

1:01:07.620 --> 1:01:09.827
and I'm really, really proud
of myself for that.

1:01:09.896 --> 1:01:11.931
All I have to really say
is thank you so much,

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.931
because this quite literally

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.344
is the beginning
of the rest of my life.

1:01:20.793 --> 1:01:23.724
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:01:23.793 --> 1:01:26.172
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:26.241 --> 1:01:28.275
how the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:28.344 --> 1:01:29.724
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:29.793 --> 1:01:30.931
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.103
All right.
Now let the music play!

1:01:51.827 --> 1:01:53.965
Next time
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

1:01:54.034 --> 1:01:59.448
You need to lead DragCon panels
to tackle the topic of men.

1:01:59.517 --> 1:02:03.241
-You've got male...privilege.

1:02:03.310 --> 1:02:05.000
I've never had sex
or been in a relationship

1:02:05.068 --> 1:02:06.241
because I only do anal.

1:02:07.379 --> 1:02:09.344
I knew about toxic masculi--

1:02:09.413 --> 1:02:12.275
toxic masculinity
at a very young age.

1:02:13.586 --> 1:02:14.931
You know how to tell a joke.

1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.344
You were fucking hilarious.

1:02:16.413 --> 1:02:19.172
I think it is
an incredibly stupid idea

1:02:19.241 --> 1:02:20.586
to count anybody out.

1:02:20.655 --> 1:02:22.413
She's like a little sister

1:02:22.482 --> 1:02:25.931
that I wanna bash her head
into the concrete floor.
