00:01.550 --> 00:03.950

00:04.100 --> 00:05.579
EDDIE IS THE HEAD
OF THE DESIGN DEPARTMENT.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.790
- MR. KRAFI',
THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR,

00:07.930 --> 00:09.966
HE LIKED IT--
WE'RE IN THE READING SERIES.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.554
- JASMINE,
WHY DON'T YOU SHARE

00:11.700 --> 00:13.144
YOUR VISION FOR YOUR MARRIAGE
IN TEN YEARS?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.759
- I'M THINKING
ABOUT BUYING A HOUSE,

00:14.910 --> 00:18.289
IN HOPES THAT JASMINE WILL WANT
TO COME LIVE IN IT WITH ME.

00:18.430 --> 00:19.590
- SHE'S 16 YEARS OLD.
HE'S HAVING SEX.

00:19.740 --> 00:21.389
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:21.530 --> 00:22.872
- IT'S WHEN
THEY'RE PUSHING YOU AWAY,

00:23.020 --> 00:24.009
IT'S WHEN THEY'RE TELLING YOU
THEY KNOW BETTER--

00:24.160 --> 00:25.946
THAT'S WHEN
YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP.

00:26.090 --> 00:27.227
NOW I'M AFRAID IT'S TOO LATE.

01:25.010 --> 01:29.071
IN YOU

01:35.260 --> 01:41.051
IN EVERYTHING...

01:41.200 --> 01:43.851
- HEY, DAD, IT'S ME AGAIN.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.821
SHE'S STILL IN SURGERY.
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.825
BUT I GUESS JUST CALL ME BACK
WHENEVER YOU GET THIS.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.301
BYE.

01:50.450 --> 01:54.728

01:54.870 --> 01:57.691

02:04.950 --> 02:06.941
- YOU SHOULD TRY TO EAT
SOMETHING IF YOU CAN.

02:07.090 --> 02:10.059
I KNOW THIS IS THE HARD PART,
YOU KNOW, THE WAITING,

02:10.190 --> 02:12.499
NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.949
BUT JUST THINK POSITIVE.
SHE'LL PULL THROUGH.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.601
SHE'S A STRONG GIRL.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.162
- THANKS.

02:19.310 --> 02:22.063
- THANK YOU.

LOOKS SO DIFFERENT.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.217

"DIFFERENT"?

02:32.350 --> 02:36.730
- JUST...GROWN UP.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.597
- HEY, SWEETIE.

02:51.610 --> 02:53.430
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY HAVE HERE.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.445
- NO, DAD, YOU SAID THAT
WE COULD GO TO GET PANCAKES,

02:55.580 --> 02:57.400
AND NOW I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF...

02:57.550 --> 02:58.994
- LOOK AT THIS.
- AND I WANT TO GO.

02:59.140 --> 03:00.926
- MAX, WE HAVE DANISHES--
- NO, I DON'T WANT A DANISH.

03:01.070 --> 03:02.753
- MAX, TAKE IT EASY.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.379
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHERE
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT, OKAY?

03:04.520 --> 03:06.385
WE'RE HERE FONIBAMBER AND--

03:06.530 --> 03:08.760
YOU SAID THAT AMBER
WASN'T GONNA DIE, RIGHT?

03:08.910 --> 03:11.424
SO IF AMBER'S
NOT GONNA DIE, THEN--

03:11.570 --> 03:13.879
YOU KNOW,
EVEN IF SHE WAS GONNA DIE,

03:14.020 --> 03:16.079
WE'RE NOT DOCTORS--
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.606
SITTING HERE
RIGHT NOW ISN'T HELPING.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.560
- THIS IS ONE OF THESE THINGS
WE TALKED ABOUT.

03:19.710 --> 03:21.052
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS--
- I'M HUNGRY!

03:21.200 --> 03:22.462
- OKAY, WE HAVE
TO BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER,

03:22.610 --> 03:23.884
AND RIGHT NOW
WE'RE HERE FOR AMBER.

03:24.030 --> 03:26.089
- NO, DAD, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT AMBER RIGHT NOW.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.229
- MAX, PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.
- I'M HUNGRY,

03:27.370 --> 03:29.235
AND I WANT TO EAT NOW!

03:29.380 --> 03:30.517
- HEY, MAX!

03:30.650 --> 03:32.584

A FRICKIN' DANISH, OKAY?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.540

- MAX. I'M SO SORRY.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.896
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.
- DAD, I WANT FOOD!

03:38.040 --> 03:39.348
- I'M GONNA GIVE HIM
A BREAK, OKAY?

03:39.490 --> 03:41.526
DON'T.
PLEASE DON'T HIT ME.

03:41.660 --> 03:45.005

03:54.640 --> 03:58.644
SHE'S A VERY,
VERY LUCKY GIRL.

03:58.790 --> 04:01.020
SHE HAS A SMALL INJURY
TO HER SPLEEN,

04:01.170 --> 04:03.229
NO INTERNAL DAMAGE,

04:03.380 --> 04:05.826
A BROKEN RIB,
AND--AND A CRACKED WRIST.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.349
- THAT'S--OKAY.
CAN WE SEE HER?

04:08.480 --> 04:10.175
- SHE'S SEDATED.
SHE'S NOT CONSCIOUS.

04:10.310 --> 04:11.652
- I DON'T CARE.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.415
- YEAH.
COME ON IN.

04:16.490 --> 04:23.703

WILL TAKE MY HAND

04:23.840 --> 04:27.469
AND I WILL UNDERSTAND

04:27.610 --> 04:29.259

04:39.310 --> 04:42.370
YOU'RE OKAY.

MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW

05:14.270 --> 05:16.477
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

05:16.620 --> 05:18.997
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE

JUST TRY NOT TO BREATHE
TOO DEEP, OKAY?

06:08.600 --> 06:11.398
IT'S GONNA HURT.

06:11.540 --> 06:13.292

THE NURSE, HUH?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.533

- MY GYN ECOLOGIST.

06:40.330 --> 06:41.774

YOU HAVE TO GET CHECKED.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.744
YOU NEED A PAP SMEAR.
YOU NEED TO GET...

06:45.880 --> 06:47.438
- BIRTH CONTROL, YOU HAVE TO GET
CHECKED FOR THINGS.

06:47.570 --> 06:48.980

MOM, JUST STOP RIGHT NOW.

06:49.130 --> 06:50.643
JUST, LIKE, I'LL DO IT,
BUT I DON'T--

06:50.780 --> 06:51.986
- I'M JUST SAYING.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.745
- WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT
RIGHT NOW.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.648
- I LOVE HER, JOEL.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.510
- WELL, CALL ME LATER
AND LET ME KNOW.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.901
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

07:25.090 --> 07:28.856
UM, THANKS FOR BEING HERE
WITH MY FAMILY.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.444
- OH, OF COURSE.
I LOVE YOUR FAMILY.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.719
- LISTEN, I, UM--
I BOUGHT A HOUSE.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.543
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- NO, NO.

07:34.690 --> 07:36.999
FOR--FOR YOU.
- FOR ME?

07:37.140 --> 07:39.620
- I SOLD THE HOUSEBOAT,
AND I SOLD MY MOTORCYCLE,

07:39.760 --> 07:42.900
AND JOEL AND I HAVE BEEN
WORKING REALLY HARD ON IT,

07:43.040 --> 07:44.667
AND I THINK
IT'S GONNA TURN OUT...

07:44.800 --> 07:47.189
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.665
- CROSBY, YOU CAN'T BUY
YOUR WAY OUT OF WHAT YOU DID.

07:50.810 --> 07:55.258
- I-I'M NOT TRYING TO BUY
MY WAY OUT OF ANYTHING.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.786
- [sighs]
JUST LET ME GO.

08:02.930 --> 08:04.306
- LISTEN, I WASN'T
EVEN GONNA TELL YOU,

08:04.440 --> 08:06.260
ESPECIALLY NOT HERE IN
THE PARKING LOT OF A HOSPITAL,

08:06.410 --> 08:10.926
BUT, YOU KNOW, I SAW YOU INSIDE,
AND I JUST FELT LIKE...

08:11.070 --> 08:13.937
I DON'T KNOW--JUST--
COULD YOU JUST--

08:14.070 --> 08:16.868
COULD YOU COME LOOK AT IT?
COULD YOU COME OVER AND LOOK?

08:20.120 --> 08:24.591
AND I THINK WE'RE DOING
A PRE'ITY GOOD JOB.

08:24.740 --> 08:25.968
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.985
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE
THE POT OF GOLD YET,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.429
AND YOU'RE NOT IN IT,
BUT...

08:30.570 --> 08:32.572
YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'S A START.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.192
- I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

08:50.940 --> 08:54.068
- ALL RIGHT,
HEY, HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.179
LISTEN, MAX.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.561
I WANT TO...TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

09:01.710 --> 09:02.563
AT THE HOSPITAL.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.678
- I'M EATING.

09:04.820 --> 09:09.052
- THE THING IS, MAX,
WE'RE PART OF A FAMILY.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.260
AND WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO SOMEBODY IN THE FAMILY,

09:12.410 --> 09:15.299
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO AMBER,
WE WANNA BE THERE FOR THEM.

09:15.450 --> 09:17.509
DOESN'T MATTER HOW HUNGRY
WE ARE OR HOW TIRED WE ARE.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.299
WE WANNA SHOW UP
FOR THE PERSON

09:20.450 --> 09:23.863
THAT'S HAVING TROUBLE.

09:24.010 --> 09:27.036
FAMILY'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN OUR LIVES.

09:27.180 --> 09:28.215
- MM-HMM.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.149
- SO...

09:31.290 --> 09:33.144
I THINK BECAUSE OF
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID,

09:33.290 --> 09:36.498
IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU
APOLOGIZED TO YOUR AUNT SARAH.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.255
- I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

09:38.400 --> 09:42.018
YOU PROMISED ME THAT
WE COULD GO TO GET PANCAKES,

09:42.160 --> 09:46.051
AND THEN YOU
KEPT MAKING ME WAIT.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.680
- MAX, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE WORD "EMPATHY?"

09:48.820 --> 09:50.822
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

09:50.960 --> 09:52.200
OKAY.
WELL, IT MEANS

09:52.350 --> 09:54.136
THAT WE THINK ABOUT
OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS

09:54.280 --> 09:56.748
WHEN WE DO THINGS--
NOT JUST OUR OWN.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.765
AND THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU STRUGGLE WITH

09:58.900 --> 10:00.140
BECAUSE OF YOUR ASPERGER'S.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.690
SO YOU'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG,

10:01.840 --> 10:04.491
AND I JUST WANNA
HELP YOU LEARN EMPATHY.

10:04.630 --> 10:06.143
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA

10:06.290 --> 10:09.088
TO APOLOGIZE
TO AUNT SARAH

10:09.220 --> 10:12.189
FOR SAYING THAT YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT AMBER.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.363
- CAN I HAVE
MORE WHIPPED CREAM?

10:19.650 --> 10:21.333
- YEAH.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.757
- ALL RIGHT,
I MIGHT HAVE TO MISS

10:24.900 --> 10:26.094
THE BEGINNING OF
THIS MEETING.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.787
IF I DO, PLEASE
TAKE EXTENSIVE NOTES.

10:27.930 --> 10:29.727
YEAH, I'M--I'LL
BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

10:29.870 --> 10:31.246
I JUST...
- [breathing]

10:31.380 --> 10:33.177
- I AM AT THE HOSPITAL.
- OH, GOD, HELP ME!

10:33.320 --> 10:34.582
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.174
- JULIA?
- HI.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.072
- SYDNEY'S MOM.
- YEAH.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.733
- I WAS SYDNEY'S TEACHER
LAST YEAR.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.632
- OH, MY GOD,
MS. WOO.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.635
- YOU CAN CAI-'l-IL ME GRACE.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.532
YOU'RE PREGNANT.
- YEAH, YOU THINK?

10:45.670 --> 10:48.184
OH, GOD! JULIA, THIS BABY
NEEDS TO COME OUT OF ME NOW.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.501
- OKAY,
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU, UM..

10:49.640 --> 10:50.880
- I NEED YOUR HELP.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.339
- WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
TO A NURSE, OKAY?

10:52.470 --> 10:54.222
- I CAN'T GET MY DAMN HUSBAND.
HE'S IN TRIAL.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.234
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO CELL PHONES
ALLOWED IN THERE.

10:55.370 --> 10:56.439
JUST--I HATE HIM.

10:56.580 --> 10:57.717
YOU KNOW, I JUST
DON'T KNOW WHY I MARRIED HIM.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.202
I HATE LAWYERS.
[deep breath]

10:59.340 --> 11:01.752
- EXCUSE ME.
SHE'S IN LABOR.

11:01.900 --> 11:04.130
- WHO'S YOUR DOCTOR?
- I DON'T KNOW!

11:04.280 --> 11:06.555
- OKAY, WE NEED A WHEELCHAIR.
- GRACE, BREATHE.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.099
IS THIS YOUR FIRST?
- OH, YEAH.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.797
- OKAY.
- I'M ALL BY MYSELF, YOU KNOW.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.908
MY FAMILY--
ALL MY FAMILY'S BACK EAST.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.938
THIS IS TWO WEEKS EARLY.
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.640
- WOW.
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.182
- OKAY.
- STAY WITH ME.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.706
- WHAT?
- WE SHOULD GO.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.080
- PLEASE.

11:23.230 --> 11:24.219
- OKAY.

11:24.370 --> 11:25.951
I'M GONNA GET
YOU CHECKED IN, OKAY?

11:26.090 --> 11:26.909
- THANK YOU.
- UM...

11:27.060 --> 11:28.436
- YOU ARE WONDERFUL.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.855
YOU'RE JUST--YOU'LL GET
THIS THING OUT OF ME, RIGHT?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.166
[knocking]
- HEY.

11:37.310 --> 11:38.925
- ADAM.
- I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

11:39.070 --> 11:41.004
- DUDE, YOU LOOK LIKE
A WRECK, MAN--WHAT HAPPENED?

11:41.140 --> 11:42.107
- I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.933
LISTEN...
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.001
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

11:45.150 --> 11:47.289
I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT YOU FIRED EDDIE

11:47.430 --> 11:49.489
AND YOU MADE SPYDER
THE HEAD OF THE DESIGN TEAM?

11:49.630 --> 11:50.972
- I DID, INDEED.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.805
LOOK, MAN,
SPYDER--SPYDER'S A GENIUS.

11:53.950 --> 11:56.498
HE'S THE FUTURE
OF THIS COMPANY, OKAY?

11:56.640 --> 11:59.120
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
WOULDN'T CONSULT ME ABOUT THIS.

11:59.270 --> 12:00.885
EDDIE HAS BEEN
WORKING HERE FOR SIX YEARS.

12:01.030 --> 12:04.056
HE'S GOT TWO KIDS.
HE'S BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.020
DID YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT HIM AS A PERSON?

12:06.170 --> 12:07.990
- I UNDERSTAND
HE'S GOT A FAMILY, OKAY?

12:08.140 --> 12:10.199
BUT WE'RE RUNNING A COMPANY.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.272
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
WE DON'T NEED EDDIE

12:12.420 --> 12:15.139
IN THE DIRECTION
WE'RE MOVING.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.349
- I SEE.

12:16.490 --> 12:19.004
HE'S NOT RADICAL ENOUGH,
HE'S NOT COOL ENOUGH,

12:19.150 --> 12:20.356
HE'S NOT HIP ENOUGH.
- LOOK...

12:20.490 --> 12:22.219
- OR WHATEVER.
- I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE ANGRY.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.760
- YEAH, I'M ANGRY.
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE A PART

12:24.910 --> 12:26.389
OF RUNNING THIS COMPANY
WITH YOU OR NOT?

12:26.530 --> 12:28.873
- I DO.
- YOU DO?

12:29.020 --> 12:30.749
'CAUSE IT
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU DO.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.677
IT FEELS LIKE
I'M HERE TO SET THINGS UP

12:32.820 --> 12:33.912
FOR YOU TO KNOCK THEM OVER.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.504
THAT'S WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE FOR ME.

12:35.650 --> 12:38.289
I'M HERE TO BE YOUR PATSY.
I'M OLD AND YOU'RE NEW,

12:38.440 --> 12:39.782
AND EVERYTHING
THAT I DO SUCKS,

12:39.930 --> 12:41.124
AND YOU'RE
JUST GONNA KNOCK IT OVER

12:41.270 --> 12:42.237
AND DO SOMETHING ELSE.

12:42.380 --> 12:43.711
THAT SEEMS
TO BE MY ROLE HERE.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.031
SO I'M JUST
GONNA SIT IN MY OFFICE

12:45.170 --> 12:48.139
AND SEE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, OKAY?

12:49.380 --> 12:51.177
- OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD!

12:51.320 --> 12:54.289
MOTH ER-FREAKING-
DAM N-HELL-CRAP-BASTARD!

12:54.420 --> 12:55.523
I HATE HIM.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.001
I HATE MY HUSBAND,
I HATE HIM SO MUCH!

12:57.150 --> 12:59.209
HOW CAN THAT SON OF A BITCH
BE ON TRIAL RIGHT NOW?

12:59.360 --> 13:01.180
HE'S NEVER ON TRIAL,
AND I'M WITH CHILD!

13:01.330 --> 13:03.013
- BREATHE, GRACE.
- OH, YEAH.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.491
- OH,
YOU'RE DOING AMAZING.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.291
- [whimpers]
OH, GOD, I'M NOT PREPARED.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.226
I DIDN'T PACK
A CAR SEAT FOR THE BABY.

13:09.370 --> 13:11.122
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TAKE THE BABY HOME?

13:11.270 --> 13:13.090
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, OKAY?

13:13.240 --> 13:14.468
- YOUR CONTRACTIONS
LOOK GREAT, GRACE.

13:14.620 --> 13:15.814
I THINK IT'S TIME TO PUSH.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.712
- UM, I'LL TAKE
THAT EPIDURAL NOW.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.919
- TOO LATE.
- WHAT?

13:20.070 --> 13:21.753
- TOO LATE.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.891
- OKAY, GRACE,
DON'T WORRY.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.553
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH HELL,

13:25.700 --> 13:27.930
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING BABY.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.172
- I THINK YOU'RE
THE MOST WONDERFUL PERSON

13:29.320 --> 13:31.356
I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.944
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SUCH A BITCH.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.638
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A BITCH.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.351
- I WANT A BIG PUSH.
ON ONE...

13:36.500 --> 13:38.229
TWO...
THREE.

13:38.360 --> 13:45.983
- [screaming]
I NEED DRUGS!

13:51.690 --> 13:53.920
- I BROUGHT YOU
SOME MILK AND COOKIES.

13:54.070 --> 13:56.038
COME ON, IT'S TEA.

13:56.180 --> 13:58.102
THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHO I'M DEALING WITH?

13:58.250 --> 14:00.764
[clears throat]
HOW YOU FEELING?

14:00.900 --> 14:02.595
- TIRED AND SORE.

14:02.730 --> 14:06.279
AND I CAN'T DO THIS PUZZLE
WITH MY HAND LIKE THIS.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.069
- YOU KNOW, HONEY,
GARY'S GETTING A DUI,

14:09.220 --> 14:13.941
AND IT'S
PRETTY...SERIOUS.

14:14.090 --> 14:16.558
- [exhales]
OKAY.

14:19.130 --> 14:20.097
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

14:20.230 --> 14:23.119
- OBVIOUSLY NOT GREAT.

14:23.270 --> 14:25.852
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.
IT'S...

14:26.000 --> 14:27.683
- BUT WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
I MEAN...

14:27.830 --> 14:30.037
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
YOU KNOW?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.273
- BUT, AMBER,
THIS IS AN ACCIDENT

14:31.420 --> 14:33.138
THAT YOU ASKED FOR
IN A WAY.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.168
- WELL, I WASN'T DRIVING,
OKAY?

14:35.320 --> 14:37.038
AND I OBVIOUSLY
GOT REALLY MESSED UP.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.147
- BUT YOU GOT
IN THE CAR WITH SOMEONE

14:38.290 --> 14:39.666
WHO WAS CLEARLY...

14:39.800 --> 14:41.597
I MEAN, HIS BLOOD-ALCOHOL
WAS THROUGH THE ROOF.

14:41.740 --> 14:42.832
- I THOUGHT HE WAS FINE.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.049
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT--THAT--

14:44.190 --> 14:45.771
- I THINK I'VE
BEEN A'I'I'ACKED ENOUGH.

14:45.910 --> 14:47.320
- I'M NOT ATI'ACKING YOU.
- WHAT ARE YOU--

14:47.470 --> 14:49.222
- I'M AFRAID.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF--

14:49.370 --> 14:50.678
- MOM, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT EVEN LISTENING.

14:50.820 --> 14:51.957
- GET WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.159
- WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM NOW?

14:53.300 --> 14:54.710
- WHAT'S MY--
LOOK AT YOU.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.920
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU PUT US THROUGH?

14:57.060 --> 14:58.300
WHAT IF YOU HAD DIED?
- I GET IT.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.135
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

15:00.270 --> 15:01.168
- IT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE YOU GET IT.

15:01.310 --> 15:02.891
- I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.066
I GET IT.
OKAY?

15:06.210 --> 15:07.586
- ALL RIGHT.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.319
- OH, HEY, HONEY?

15:16.460 --> 15:18.109
I MADE THE APPOINTMENT--
- YEAH?

15:18.260 --> 15:21.115
- FOR MAX TO GET FI'I'I'ED
FOR A NEW RETAINER.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.704
- NEW RETAINER?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD ONE?

15:22.850 --> 15:24.158
- I TOLD YOU WE LOST IT,
REMEMBER?

15:24.300 --> 15:25.506
- NO.
- YEAH, I DID TELL--

15:25.640 --> 15:27.050
- YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T FIND IT,

15:27.200 --> 15:28.053
MEANING THAT
YOU WERE GOING TO.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.713
- NO, THAT MEANS WE LOST IT.

15:29.850 --> 15:31.238
- KRISTINA,
THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE.

15:31.370 --> 15:34.134
LIKE $500.
- I AGREE, THEY'RE EXPEN--$700.

15:34.270 --> 15:35.544
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW A SON LIKE OURS,

15:35.690 --> 15:37.203
WHO CAN REMEMBER
THE MOST MEANINGLESS FACTS,

15:37.350 --> 15:39.272
CAN'T REMEMBER
WHERE HE PUT HIS RETAINER.

15:39.420 --> 15:42.002
- I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING,
BUT IT HAPPENS, OKAY?

15:42.140 --> 15:43.584
- NO, YOU JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME
AND I'M GONNA FIND IT, OKAY?

15:43.730 --> 15:45.413
- I'VE ALREADY LOOKED.
- I SAID I'M GONNA FIND IT,

15:45.560 --> 15:47.312
I'M GONNA FIND IT.
- OKAY.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.736
WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.259
ALSO, UM...

15:54.400 --> 15:56.846
I TOOK HADDIE
TO THE GYNECOLOGIST.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.220
- GREAT.

15:59.370 --> 16:02.362
- SHE'S OFFICIALLY ON
THE PILL.

16:04.410 --> 16:07.299
- SHE'S ON THE PILL.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.475
[sighs]

16:08.620 --> 16:11.202
ALL RIGHT, WELL.
HE STILL NEEDS TO WEAR A CONDOM.

16:11.340 --> 16:12.511
- I AGREE.
- YOU NEED TO TELL HER THAT.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.548
- I'LL TELL HER.
- 'CAUSE I KNOW HOW GUYS THINK.

16:14.690 --> 16:16.203
HE'S THINKING
THAT SHE'S ON THE PILL,

16:16.350 --> 16:17.169
SO HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO WEAR A CONDOM.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.209
- HONEY, I KNOW.
IT'S WEIRD.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.216
- MM-HMM!

16:24.360 --> 16:25.497
- WOULD YOU LIKE ANY MORE?

16:25.630 --> 16:26.972
- YES, PLEASE.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.394
- OH, WOULD YOU LIKE
A CUPCAKE?

16:28.530 --> 16:30.669
- YES.
- I WOULD LOVE A CUPCAKE.

16:30.810 --> 16:34.325
- THAT ONE DOES NOT MATCH,
BUT THIS ONE DOES.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.199
- THAT MATCHES?
- THAT MATCHES THE TEA.

16:36.340 --> 16:37.910
- IT MATCHES THE TEA.
WELL...

16:38.060 --> 16:39.334
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
- THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.641
- AND ANYTHING ELSE?
EXTRA LUMPS OR ANYTHING?

16:41.790 --> 16:43.826
- EXTRA LUMPS, YES.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.019
- JUST, LIKE, FIVE LUMPS.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.899
- OH, THIS IS ACTUALLY SUGAR.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.860
I CAN'T USE THAT.
- OKAY.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.137
- YEAH,
NO SUGAR, JUST LUMPS.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.147
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- GREAT.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.383
- WE'LL BE HERE.

16:55.530 --> 16:58.215
- SO. ..
SO ANYWAY.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.908
YEAH, IT ENDED UP
BEING FINE.

17:01.050 --> 17:03.109
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
TO GET HER AN EPIDURAL,

17:03.260 --> 17:05.012
AND SHE WAS
SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.321
I MEAN, IT WAS--
SHE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN.

17:07.470 --> 17:09.609
I FORGOT THE REALITY
OF GIVING BIRTH.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.332
- YEAH.
- ACTUALLY, I'M JUST GLAD

17:12.470 --> 17:15.928
THAT I DON'T HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.199
- YEAH.

17:18.340 --> 17:19.955
UH, IT'S GREAT THAT
YOU WERE THERE FOR HER.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.068
- WELL, THANKS.

17:22.210 --> 17:26.169
WE HAVE SUCH
AN AMAZING LIFE, JOEL.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.799
THE THREE OF US.

17:27.940 --> 17:31.103
DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.184
VERY HAPPY.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.697
- WELL, HERE I COME.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.149
- HELLO!
- HELLO.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.429
- ALL RIGHT, UM...

17:40.570 --> 17:42.492
"SUDDENLY HANNAH'S FAMILY
MATERIALIZES

17:42.640 --> 17:44.460
SURROUNDING HER
ON THE COUCH."

17:44.610 --> 17:46.646
- THE COUCH OPENS OUT
INTO A BED.

17:46.780 --> 17:48.475
- REALLY? AWESOME.
- OH, JEEZ.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.953
- OH, MY GOD.
- DAD?

17:51.100 --> 17:54.206
- HONEY, YOU REALLY OUGHT
TO THINK THIS THING THROUGH.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.160
HE'S A MAILMAN.
- HEY, GUYS IN UNIFORM ARE CUTE.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.857
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.649
- TRYING TO KEEP YOU
FROM MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.755
- WHY IS THERE NOTHING
IN THE FRIDGE?

18:00.900 --> 18:02.106
DON'T MAILM EN EAT?

18:02.250 --> 18:04.286
- HANNAH, YOU'RE
THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY.

18:04.420 --> 18:07.241
- PAUL, DON'T--DON'T
COME DOWN SO HARD ON HER.

18:07.390 --> 18:10.109
- ME?
- LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT, YEAH.

18:10.260 --> 18:11.397
- GIL?
- WHY DON'T WE GET THROUGH

18:11.530 --> 18:13.225
THE PLAY ONCE
WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.497
- YES.
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY

18:14.640 --> 18:17.256
WE'LL GET
A SENSE OF THE WHOLE.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.152
- HANNAH, YOU'RE THROWING
YOUR LIFE AWAY.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.983
- I'M LONELY, OKAY?

18:21.130 --> 18:22.267
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SUCH A SNOB.

18:22.410 --> 18:24.162
- OKAY, IF YOU
GO THROUGH WITH THIS,

18:24.310 --> 18:26.232
I OFFICIALLY GIVE UP.
I MEAN IT, HANNAH.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.757
IT'S OVER.
- YOU JUDGING ME IS OVER?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.300
- CAN'T YOU SEE THAT EVERYTHING
I DO IS ONLY TRYING TO HELP?

18:31.450 --> 18:33.793
BUT YOU NEVER SEEM TO GET THAT.
I WORKED SO HARD,

18:33.940 --> 18:36.135
AND YOU CONTINUE TO
THROW YOUR LIFE DOWN THE TOILET.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.656
- PAUL, I'M SO SORRY.
I JUST WANT--

18:37.800 --> 18:39.279
I DON'T WANT YOU TO
GET STUCK DOING IT THIS WAY.

18:39.420 --> 18:40.694
'CAUSE, UM--
LET ME SEE IF I CAN--

18:40.840 --> 18:42.148
- YOU KNOW THIS
IS A READ-THROUGH, RIGHT?

18:42.290 --> 18:43.598
- NO, NO--
- LET'S JUST TAKE FIVE.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.321
- I DON'T WANNA DEAL WITH THIS.
- I'M JUST TRYING

18:45.460 --> 18:46.700
TO GET IT RIGHT.
- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY,

18:46.840 --> 18:48.705
GIL, I REALLY DO,
BUT LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

18:48.850 --> 18:50.806
- I--WHY ARE ACTORS
SO SENSITIVE?

18:50.950 --> 18:52.599
- I'M NOT BEING SENSITIVE.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.638
- I'M JUST TRYING TO
GET IT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.600
- I'M SORRY,
YOUR PLAY'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH

18:56.750 --> 18:59.401
FOR ME TO PUT UP WITH YOU.
- SHUT UP PLEASE AND BE QUIET!

18:59.550 --> 19:01.165
AND I THINK
I NEED FIVE MINUTES OFF.

19:01.310 --> 19:02.402
- I'M TAKING FIVE.
I'M TAKING FIVE.

19:02.550 --> 19:04.927
- ARE WE DONE?
- WELL, THIS IS A BLAST.

19:05.070 --> 19:07.061
- SARAH, SARAH, PLEASE.

SARAH...

19:10.700 --> 19:14.170
HONEY, LOOK.
REALLY, HOLD.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.288
I REALLY THINK
YOU KINDA LET THE ACTORS

19:16.430 --> 19:17.454
GO THROUGH IT
A COUPLE OF TIMES,

19:17.600 --> 19:18.942
BEFORE YOU START--
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.184
DAD, I'M COMPLETELY...

19:21.330 --> 19:22.911
I'M--YOU KNOW...

19:23.050 --> 19:26.599
I'M, LIKE, NUMB INSIDE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW...

19:26.750 --> 19:29.878
I JUST KEEP THINKING
OF WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

19:30.030 --> 19:33.090
AND YOU KNOW,
I COULD HAVE LOST HER.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.368
I DON'T THINK SHE LEARNED
ANYTHING FROM THAT ACCIDENT.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.306
AND I'M JUST...

19:38.450 --> 19:40.680
I'M TERRIFIED THAT--
I'M TERRIFIED.

19:53.910 --> 19:57.289
- HEY.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.182
YOU SHOW HER THE PLACE?

19:59.330 --> 20:03.812
- UH...YEAH,
SHE HASN'T COME OVER.

20:05.890 --> 20:07.505
- [sighs]

20:07.650 --> 20:10.574
[The Walkmen's
While I Shovel The Snow]

20:12.310 --> 20:14.232
- WELL, THEY SAY

20:14.380 --> 20:16.996
CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE

20:17.140 --> 20:18.584
BUT I'M STUCK

20:18.730 --> 20:20.106
- THANKS FOR
LETTING ME COME OVER.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.219
- ON A WINNING STREAK
- YOU SAID IT WAS URGENT.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.215
- UM...

20:26.360 --> 20:29.215
UM, I JUST WANNA SAY SORRY.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.158
I'M SORRY
WE FOUGHT OVER DISHES,

20:32.300 --> 20:36.464
AND I'M SORRY
I HAD AN AFFAIR.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.579
I'M SORRY I DID THAT
TO YOU AND OUR SON.

20:42.820 --> 20:43.889
I LOVE YOU,

20:44.030 --> 20:46.999
AND I'M ALWAYS
GONNA BE THERE FOR JABBAR.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.240
AND I WISH THERE
WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO

20:52.380 --> 20:54.416
TO MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

20:54.560 --> 20:57.108
SAY SOMETHING MAGICAL,
OR BUY YOU A HOUSE.

20:57.250 --> 21:01.357
BUT...
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

21:01.500 --> 21:05.254
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL WEIRD AROUND ME.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.699
I SCREWED UP.
IT'S ALL ME.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.226
AND I WANT YOU
TO FEEL FREEDOM,

21:14.370 --> 21:17.430
MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

21:19.550 --> 21:22.758
I'M NOT GONNA
PURSUE YOU ANYMORE.

21:22.900 --> 21:27.655
UM...

21:27.800 --> 21:29.654
THAT'S IT.

21:33.050 --> 21:35.939

21:38.360 --> 21:41.181
[knock at door]

21:41.330 --> 21:43.798
- CAN YOU PUT YOUR BOOK DOWN
AND GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION?

21:43.950 --> 21:45.326
MAX?
- DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE

21:45.470 --> 21:47.222
SCORPIONS THAT CAN
SURVIVE ON ONLY ONE MEAL

21:47.370 --> 21:50.578
FOR THE WHOLE YEAR?

21:50.720 --> 21:52.745
- NO.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

21:52.890 --> 21:54.949
NOW, LISTEN, RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT
GONNA TALK ABOUT BUGS, OKAY?

21:55.100 --> 21:58.206
WE ARE GOING TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE YOUR RETAINER IS.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.033
- IT'S LOST.
- I KNOW IT'S LOST, MAX,

22:00.180 --> 22:02.489
BUT IT HASN'T DISAPPEARED
FOREVER, RIGHT?

22:02.630 --> 22:04.279
NOW LET'S USE
THAT GOOD MEMORY OF YOURS.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.103
[sighs]
MAX.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.660
- DAD, HEY!

22:07.800 --> 22:08.971
- I JUST NEED YOU TO
SHIl-T YOUR FOCUS, OKAY?

22:09.120 --> 22:11.327
- DAD, THAT'S NOT WHERE IT GOES!
- WE'LL GET IT IN A MINUTE.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.563
I NEED YOU
TO JUST FOCUS, OKAY?

22:12.710 --> 22:14.041
- I ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THIS WITH MOM.

22:14.190 --> 22:15.600
- I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT IT
WITH YOUR MOTHER,

22:15.740 --> 22:16.729
BUT NOW YOU'RE
GONNA TALK ABOUT IT WITH ME.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.393
WHERE'S THE LAST PLACE
YOU SAW YOUR RETAINER?

22:18.540 --> 22:20.292
- IF I KNEW THAT,
THEN I'D KNOW WHERE IT WAS,

22:20.440 --> 22:21.771
AND WE'D FIND IT.
- YES, MAX.

22:21.920 --> 22:22.989
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.
LET'S THINK OF ALL

22:23.130 --> 22:24.677
THE PLACES YOU WERE
THE DAY YOU LOST IT.

22:24.820 --> 22:26.196
WE'LL MAKE A LIST.
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER, ALL RIGHT?

22:26.340 --> 22:27.955
LET ME GRAB A PEN.
MAX!

22:28.100 --> 22:29.897
ALL RIGHT, TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR BOOK, OKAY?

22:30.030 --> 22:31.679
- NO, DAD, THAT PEN'S
NOT FOR WRITING.

22:31.830 --> 22:33.104
THAT PEN IS FOR COLORING!
- MAX, I'LL PUT IT RIGHT BACK.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.242
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS--
- YOU WERE IN YOUR ROOM...

22:35.380 --> 22:36.722
YOU WERE IN THE KITCHEN.
- CAN'T YOU JUST

22:36.870 --> 22:38.007
BUY ANOTHER ONE?
- NO, WE CAN'T.

22:38.140 --> 22:40.176
THEY'RE $700, MAX!
- THEN GO TO THE ATM!

22:40.320 --> 22:42.106
- YOU CAN'T JUST GO
TO AN ATM AND GET MONEY--

22:42.250 --> 22:43.387
MAX, LET GO.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.974
MAX, I WANT YOU
TO SIT DOWN RIGHT NOW.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.146
MAX, SIT DOWN!

22:48.290 --> 22:51.839
[sighs]

22:51.990 --> 22:55.812
- ARE YOU...MAD AT ME
BECAUSE I HAVE ASPERGER'S?

23:02.340 --> 23:03.955
- NO, MAX, I'M NOT--

23:04.100 --> 23:06.728
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ASPERGER'S.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.727
NEVER.

23:16.290 --> 23:17.359
[sighs]

23:17.490 --> 23:19.765
[seagulls screeching]

23:19.910 --> 23:21.184
- SO...

23:21.330 --> 23:24.356
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

23:24.500 --> 23:28.846
- I WANT YOU
TO SEE SOMETHING.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.959
- [sighs]

23:36.060 --> 23:37.504
- RECOGNIZE IT?

23:37.650 --> 23:42.303
- [sniffs]
YEAH, IT'S...THE CAR.

23:42.450 --> 23:43.826
IT'S GARY'S CAR.

23:43.970 --> 23:47.178
- MM-HMM.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.175
COME HERE.
TAKE A LOOK.

23:52.740 --> 23:56.187
YOU LOOKIN'?

23:56.330 --> 23:58.594

I SEE IT.

23:59.740 --> 24:01.674
- AMBER...

24:01.810 --> 24:07.157
YOU KNOW, I WAS
TWO YEARS IN VIETNAM.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.269
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT?

24:10.410 --> 24:12.514
WHAT I DREAMT ABOUT?

24:12.650 --> 24:15.164
WAS COMING HOME.

24:15.310 --> 24:18.177
AND HAVING A FAMILY.

24:18.310 --> 24:20.699
HAVING GRANDKIDS.

24:20.830 --> 24:23.867
I DREAMT YOU, AMBER.

24:40.440 --> 24:44.126
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD
SOME BAD BREAKS.

24:44.270 --> 24:46.682
NOT FEELING
GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

24:46.830 --> 24:48.377
YOU DIDN'T
GET INTO BERKELEY.

24:48.520 --> 24:52.650
WELL, BOO-FREAKING-HOO.

YOU'RE A BRAVERMAN.

24:58.460 --> 25:02.009
YOU GOT MY BLOOD
IN YOUR VEINS.

25:02.150 --> 25:04.118
YOU EVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN--

25:04.260 --> 25:07.081
YOU EVEN THINKABOUT
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

25:07.220 --> 25:09.256
I WILL PERSONALLY
KICK YOUR LITTLE BUTT

25:09.400 --> 25:12.506
ALL THE WAY FROM HERE
TO THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.

25:14.370 --> 25:18.124
YOU DO NOT HAVE MY PERMISSION
TO MESS WITH MY DREAMS.

I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR LOSING IT.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.183
I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO THAT.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.255
I JUST HAD A LATE NIGHT,
WAS AT THE HOSPITAL, AND...

26:15.400 --> 26:16.708

THIS IS YOUR COMPANY,
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO HIRE

26:20.160 --> 26:22.219

26:38.590 --> 26:40.103
CHOOSE A NEW DIRECTION...
- MM-HMM.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.729

26:44.560 --> 26:46.949
