WEBVTT

00:01.996 --> 00:03.130
DOLE: Previously
on The Practice.

00:03.165 --> 00:04.599
You're losing, Helen.

00:04.632 --> 00:05.833
I'm taking over
first chair.

00:05.867 --> 00:09.204
Now, I'm gonna prep
the investigating officer alone.

00:09.237 --> 00:11.606
What other evidence
connects Mr. MacIntyre

00:11.639 --> 00:12.707
to Mr. Hayden's murder?

00:12.740 --> 00:14.476
Mr. MacIntyre
was tried for killing

00:14.509 --> 00:15.610
his former business partner.

00:15.643 --> 00:17.379
Objection!
JUDGE: Sustained.

00:17.412 --> 00:19.113
Counsel, chambers.

00:19.146 --> 00:20.582
DONNELL: You did this
intentionally.

00:20.615 --> 00:22.284
You conspired
with the detective.

00:22.317 --> 00:23.851
That's completely untrue.

00:23.885 --> 00:25.787
Then I wanna put
Helen Gamble on the stand.

00:25.820 --> 00:29.056
Do you have any basis
to believe Mr. Walsh

00:29.090 --> 00:32.394
did intend to cause a mistrial?

00:32.427 --> 00:35.463
Yes. Mr. Walsh made sure
to exclude me

00:35.497 --> 00:37.365
when he prepped
Detective Simons.

00:37.399 --> 00:39.467
JUDGE: The case against
the defendant is dismissed

00:39.501 --> 00:40.702
with prejudice.

00:40.735 --> 00:43.671
I did my ethical duty.

00:43.705 --> 00:45.473
Only because you
were dragged into it.

00:45.507 --> 00:46.841
You're not a hero.

00:56.284 --> 00:58.720
Art, what the hell's
going on?

00:58.753 --> 01:00.322
Take it easy.
DONNELL: You take it easy.

01:00.355 --> 01:01.323
Trial starts tomorrow.

01:01.356 --> 01:03.758
Why is our co-defendant
talking to the D. A.?

01:03.791 --> 01:05.025
He's cutting a deal.

01:05.059 --> 01:06.160
What?
BERLUTI: He can't do that.

01:06.194 --> 01:07.262
We had a deal,

01:07.295 --> 01:09.063
a joint defense
all mapped out.

01:09.096 --> 01:11.566
ART: Hey, I called out
of courtesy.

01:11.599 --> 01:13.034
But our client
is innocent.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.370
Well, mine's pleading
guilty.

01:15.403 --> 01:16.404
Sorry, Jimmy.

01:16.438 --> 01:17.905
It's just how it is.

01:17.939 --> 01:20.542
Art, at least tell us

01:20.575 --> 01:22.577
what he's saying in there
about our client.

01:32.287 --> 01:34.088
NORMAN: So hot.

01:34.121 --> 01:36.624
She sucked the air
right out of my lungs.

01:38.726 --> 01:42.864
I did play
with matches as a boy.

01:42.897 --> 01:43.965
And then you get older

01:43.998 --> 01:47.068
and you need it to last.

01:47.101 --> 01:48.170
Give her air.

01:48.203 --> 01:49.937
She'll come big for you.

01:49.971 --> 01:50.805
She'll come big.

01:50.838 --> 01:53.208
Jesus, will you look at that?

01:54.976 --> 01:57.078
You disgust me.
Helen...

01:57.645 --> 01:59.146
GAMBLE: We want the jury
to believe you,

01:59.181 --> 02:00.948
not to be sickened by you.

02:00.982 --> 02:03.084
You think you can manage that?

02:03.117 --> 02:05.687
I love the new haircut.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.589
It makes you look
like my ex-wife.

02:07.622 --> 02:08.955
You know what?

02:08.990 --> 02:10.324
Mr. Tucker...

02:15.062 --> 02:16.764
Yes, Mr. Walsh?

02:16.798 --> 02:19.634
A night watchman died
in that fire.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.836
Cooperating against
your co-defendant

02:21.869 --> 02:26.574
is the only way you avoid
a life sentence.

02:26.608 --> 02:29.177
Take this seriously.

02:29.211 --> 02:31.546
Yes, Mr. Walsh.
I understand.

02:33.715 --> 02:36.784
I said I'd testify
against Ronald D'Ambrosio

02:36.818 --> 02:37.952
and I will.

02:39.053 --> 02:41.489
He hired me to burn down
his business.

02:41.523 --> 02:42.390
He's guilty.

02:42.424 --> 02:44.626
The jury will believe me.

02:44.659 --> 02:46.160
They'll convict that mobster.

02:46.194 --> 02:47.295
I swear.

02:50.898 --> 02:53.368
Now, could I please watch

02:53.401 --> 02:54.636
the end of the tape?

02:57.972 --> 03:01.976
(music playing)

03:48.390 --> 03:49.657
Forty-two years,

03:49.691 --> 03:52.159
biggest manufacturer
in the north end.

03:54.262 --> 03:57.332
And it all went
in less than five minutes.

03:57.365 --> 03:58.466
You remember it, Jimmy.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.001
You worked here
as a kid, right,

04:00.034 --> 04:01.836
during summer vacation.

04:01.869 --> 04:04.406
I remember,
Mr. D'Ambrosio.

04:04.439 --> 04:07.742
I remember how heavy
this stuff was to move.

04:07.775 --> 04:10.245
D'AMBROSIO:
Beautiful tables, chairs,

04:10.278 --> 04:12.013
solid craftsmanship.

04:12.046 --> 04:13.948
This place was my life.

04:13.981 --> 04:17.418
Your father, Lenny,
worked 20 years.

04:17.452 --> 04:21.656
He knew the man who died,
the watchman.

04:21.689 --> 04:23.425
He was a friend of mine.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.060
He knew I would die

04:26.093 --> 04:28.430
before I would burn
this business.

04:28.463 --> 04:32.133
Mr. D'Ambrosio,
we need to talk about Tucker.

04:32.167 --> 04:35.069
How can he say
I paid him to do it?

04:35.102 --> 04:36.871
Before, he said
we were innocent.

04:36.904 --> 04:39.441
He's agreed to testify
against you

04:39.474 --> 04:40.908
for a reduced sentence.

04:40.942 --> 04:41.743
This is a nightmare.

04:41.776 --> 04:44.246
I'm innocent,
but I can be convicted

04:44.279 --> 04:46.181
of murder anyway,
sent away for life?

04:46.214 --> 04:48.082
We're gonna do
everything we can

04:48.115 --> 04:49.751
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

04:49.784 --> 04:52.587
I'm two times
Businessman of the Year,

04:52.620 --> 04:53.588
Sons of Italy.

04:53.621 --> 04:54.356
I know.

04:54.389 --> 04:55.657
Stop saying you know.

04:55.690 --> 04:56.691
You don't know.

04:56.724 --> 04:59.294
It wasn't always
so nice for us here.

05:00.027 --> 05:02.830
Sure, now we got a mayor,
a governor,

05:02.864 --> 05:06.000
but nothing changes,
not for us, Jimmy.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.369
What do you mean?

05:07.402 --> 05:09.837
To your face,
it's always respect.

05:09.871 --> 05:13.140
But behind your back,
they talk, they assume.

05:13.175 --> 05:15.377
I mean, you could
be Justice Scalia.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.678
If your name
ends in a vowel,

05:16.711 --> 05:19.481
they think
you're La Cosa Nostra.

05:24.452 --> 05:26.354
I've known him
my whole life.

05:26.388 --> 05:28.022
He's not mobbed up.

05:28.055 --> 05:30.425
I understand,
but his business was hurting

05:30.458 --> 05:32.026
and he did get
the insurance.

05:32.059 --> 05:33.595
BERLUTI: He's innocent.

05:33.628 --> 05:36.598
In our house,
the Holy Trinity

05:36.631 --> 05:38.666
was Pope John XXIII,

05:38.700 --> 05:41.469
JFK, and Ronald D'Ambrosio.

05:41.503 --> 05:43.538
Why would Tucker
plead to a crime

05:43.571 --> 05:44.639
he didn't commit?

05:44.672 --> 05:48.843
Whatever the reason,
he's wrong about Mr. D'Ambrosio.

05:50.245 --> 05:53.581
Bobby, we can't lose.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.155
DONNELL: For months,
we planned a joint defense.

06:01.489 --> 06:02.324
Now, out of the blue,

06:02.357 --> 06:03.658
our co-defendant pleads
guilty.

06:03.691 --> 06:04.759
Which is his right.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.127
DONNELL:
The D. A. engineered it

06:06.160 --> 06:08.396
so the plea would come on
the eve of the trial.

06:08.430 --> 06:11.166
GAMBLE: Mr. Tucker
initiated that deal, not us.

06:11.199 --> 06:11.833
DONNELL: Come on.

06:11.866 --> 06:12.600
GAMBLE: It is true.

06:12.634 --> 06:14.369
He called Mr. Walsh first.

06:14.402 --> 06:15.703
DONNELL:
Even if that is true,

06:15.737 --> 06:17.104
our client has been denied
his chance

06:17.138 --> 06:18.673
to prepare a new defense.

06:18.706 --> 06:20.175
KIMBALL: Mr. Donnell,
your complaint

06:20.208 --> 06:21.976
is with Mr. Tucker,
not the D. A.

06:22.009 --> 06:23.578
If he broke his word to you,
sue him.

06:23.611 --> 06:25.513
I can't keep the D. A. from
making deals.

06:25.547 --> 06:27.148
They can make them whenever

06:27.182 --> 06:29.284
and with whomever they like.

06:29.317 --> 06:30.218
I can't help you.

06:30.252 --> 06:32.554
Then Your Honor,
we ask the Court

06:32.587 --> 06:34.556
to consider dismissing
the indictment

06:34.589 --> 06:38.159
for vindictive prosecution.
Excuse me?

06:38.193 --> 06:40.161
BERLUTI: We believe they've
targeted our client

06:40.195 --> 06:41.596
because he's Italian-American.

06:41.629 --> 06:43.198
He's right about that.

06:43.231 --> 06:44.299
Jimmy, what are you doing?

06:44.332 --> 06:46.067
We would like time
to conduct discovery

06:46.100 --> 06:46.801
into the issue so that--

06:46.834 --> 06:48.170
KIMBALL:
Do you have any evidence

06:48.203 --> 06:49.671
to suggest this happened?

06:49.704 --> 06:52.874
Most organized crime cases
involving arson

06:52.907 --> 06:54.576
have been against
Italian-Americans.

06:56.444 --> 06:59.647
Why else would a respected
businessman

06:59.681 --> 07:01.048
even be on trial?

07:01.082 --> 07:03.751
GAMBLE: Because he collected
a huge insurance settlement

07:03.785 --> 07:05.687
after his business
was burn down.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.788
BERLUTI: Allegedly.

07:06.821 --> 07:08.656
The fire was an accident.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.024
Then he has nothing
to worry about.

07:10.057 --> 07:11.125
The jury will acquit him.

07:11.158 --> 07:12.560
Your motion's denied.

07:12.594 --> 07:13.295
(gavel bangs)

07:16.531 --> 07:18.500
D'Ambrosio wants you
first chair, fine,

07:18.533 --> 07:20.302
but pull a stunt like that,
and you will lose.

07:20.335 --> 07:21.936
It was a shot.

07:21.969 --> 07:24.105
He needs to see
we're fighting for him.

07:24.138 --> 07:26.508
Just don't lose your
credibility in the process.

07:31.012 --> 07:34.349
SKIP: If you hit this,

07:34.382 --> 07:35.783
you're right to the files.

07:35.817 --> 07:37.352
Oh, right.

07:37.385 --> 07:40.121
You are totally computer
literate,

07:40.154 --> 07:41.823
which is cool.

07:41.856 --> 07:44.158
Why isn't Doogie in school?

07:44.192 --> 07:46.060
His name is Skip,

07:46.093 --> 07:48.430
and his high school
has a work-study program.

07:48.463 --> 07:50.332
He's been here eight times.

07:50.365 --> 07:53.568
He's always here, and the
computers are never fixed.

07:53.601 --> 07:55.737
If he'd quit hitting on Lucy...

07:55.770 --> 07:58.105
Is it me or
is he kind of cute?

07:58.139 --> 08:00.041
You've totally mastered
this system.

08:00.074 --> 08:01.776
Most people would take,
like, weeks.

08:01.809 --> 08:03.245
Took you, like, four days.

08:03.278 --> 08:04.579
You're awesome.

08:04.612 --> 08:05.813
Thanks.

08:05.847 --> 08:06.948
SKIP: Until you guys upgrade,

08:06.981 --> 08:08.383
there's some things I can't do.

08:08.416 --> 08:10.218
Thing with computers,

08:10.252 --> 08:11.986
they offer so much,

08:12.019 --> 08:14.489
all you have to do
is sit back

08:14.522 --> 08:17.625
and let them do it for you.

08:17.659 --> 08:20.728
It's as if they want to.

08:20.762 --> 08:22.630
Your hair smells
like summer.

08:22.664 --> 08:23.898
Are we done?

08:23.931 --> 08:26.834
I'm sorry. Yes.

08:26.868 --> 08:28.370
How much?

08:28.403 --> 08:29.237
SKIP: It's free.

08:29.271 --> 08:30.672
You guys are my friends.

08:30.705 --> 08:33.039
Oh, that is so nice.
Thank you.

08:33.073 --> 08:35.076
SKIP: Yeah, the computer
stuff is just promotional.

08:35.109 --> 08:37.010
I have other businesses.
Really?

08:37.044 --> 08:39.414
SKIP: Tutoring, investing--

08:39.447 --> 08:40.315
plus, I'm a scholar athlete.

08:40.347 --> 08:40.982
Skip...

08:41.015 --> 08:42.583
SKIP: Lettered cross country.

08:42.616 --> 08:44.186
School, junior achievement,

08:44.219 --> 08:45.620
I got a lot going on.

08:45.653 --> 08:46.621
HATCHER:
Here, if it's too much,

08:46.654 --> 08:49.056
just put it toward next time.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.759
Can I put it towards
something for us

08:51.793 --> 08:52.894
like dinner?

08:57.332 --> 08:59.667
D'Ambrosio gave me the key.

08:59.701 --> 09:01.269
That's how I got in.

09:08.443 --> 09:09.477
Match?

09:09.511 --> 09:11.313
Go over it again.

09:16.651 --> 09:17.919
I'm a designer.

09:17.952 --> 09:21.256
I bought furniture
directly from D'Ambrosio,

09:21.289 --> 09:25.092
mostly for my "ITI" clients.

09:25.126 --> 09:28.162
They just love those heavy,
dark woods. Those--

09:28.196 --> 09:30.298
GAMBLE: When did he give
you the key?

09:30.332 --> 09:32.900
You pushy bitch.

09:32.934 --> 09:34.902
Why don't you let me tell
the story?

09:39.874 --> 09:42.043
Mr. Walsh,
may I speak with you?

09:49.150 --> 09:50.318
You're personalizing this.

09:50.352 --> 09:51.753
I'm not personalizing
anything.

09:51.786 --> 09:52.687
The guy is scum.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.556
We don't get to choose
our witnesses.

09:54.589 --> 09:55.823
Look, the jury will hate him,

09:55.857 --> 09:57.859
and they will hate us
for giving him a break.

09:57.892 --> 09:58.960
We have no choice.

09:58.993 --> 10:01.429
Cutting a deal with Tucker
gets us two convictions.

10:01.463 --> 10:03.931
Without him,
D'Ambrosio walks.

10:03.965 --> 10:05.733
I'm not sure
that's a bad thing.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.502
We know he's done business

10:07.535 --> 10:09.237
with at least two crime
families.

10:09.271 --> 10:10.238
Legitimate business.

10:10.272 --> 10:11.906
He sold these people furniture.

10:11.939 --> 10:14.075
And we think
laundered money.

10:14.108 --> 10:16.110
Look me in the eye
and tell me

10:16.143 --> 10:18.613
you really think
D'Ambrosio's innocent.

10:18.646 --> 10:21.883
I'm not sure.
I have concerns.

10:21.916 --> 10:23.685
You have gone too far before.

10:23.718 --> 10:25.620
So that's what
this is about.

10:25.653 --> 10:27.789
You just had a murder
case kicked

10:27.822 --> 10:29.357
because the Court
found out you lied.

10:29.391 --> 10:33.027
I didn't lie, Helen,
not really.

10:33.060 --> 10:36.564
Besides, you weren't exactly
pure on that yourself.

10:36.598 --> 10:40.034
My point is,
sometimes in our eagerness

10:40.067 --> 10:42.704
to get the bad man,
we can lose our way.

10:43.037 --> 10:44.939
I haven't lost my way, Helen.

10:45.573 --> 10:48.176
I'm still doing the job
the public wants me to do.

10:48.210 --> 10:51.679
If anyone has lost their way,
maybe it's you.

10:58.085 --> 11:00.154
(music playing)

11:00.188 --> 11:02.924
(crackling)

11:02.957 --> 11:05.893
(laughing)

11:14.702 --> 11:16.003
Once he broke the lamp,

11:16.037 --> 11:17.972
he used the sparks to light
the legal pad.

11:18.005 --> 11:19.073
DONNELL: You got to be kidding?

11:19.106 --> 11:22.109
BERLUTI: This is your chief
witness, a sick lunatic.

11:22.143 --> 11:23.778
ART: Who your client hired
to torch--

11:23.811 --> 11:24.746
He didn't.
DONNELL: Jimmy...

11:24.779 --> 11:26.848
You're destroying
a good man's life.

11:26.881 --> 11:28.783
You want to impeach Tucker
with the fact

11:28.816 --> 11:30.618
he committed arson in custody,

11:30.652 --> 11:31.419
that's your right.

11:31.453 --> 11:33.488
Sure. You want us
to do that.

11:33.521 --> 11:35.022
It'll help your case.

11:35.056 --> 11:38.193
ART: Look, we have a continuing
discovery obligation

11:38.226 --> 11:39.861
to tell you if our witness
commits a crime,

11:39.894 --> 11:42.430
so you can use it against
him on cross.

11:42.697 --> 11:44.031
We've done that.

11:44.866 --> 11:46.033
See you in Court.

11:51.138 --> 11:52.774
If he's not guilty,

11:53.275 --> 11:55.610
why would your guy
have met with Tucker?

11:57.545 --> 12:00.648
Maybe I talked to Tucker
about business being bad.

12:00.682 --> 12:01.849
So what?

12:01.883 --> 12:04.186
I told you before,
he was a customer.

12:04.219 --> 12:06.087
D'AMBROSIO: He bought
furniture from me.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.223
DONNELL: But there are no
receipts.

12:08.256 --> 12:10.258
They burned up
in the fire.

12:10.292 --> 12:11.859
Your accountant
didn't keep copies?

12:11.893 --> 12:13.461
BERLUTI: Bobby,
we've been over this.

12:13.495 --> 12:15.330
DONNELL: And it's never
made any sense.

12:16.097 --> 12:18.533
Look, without proof
Tucker was a customer,

12:18.566 --> 12:19.701
we're screwed.

12:19.734 --> 12:21.403
No jury's gonna believe
he did business

12:21.436 --> 12:22.437
with a crazy man.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.239
D'AMBROSIO:
He was an interior decorator,

12:24.272 --> 12:26.441
for God's sake.
They're all crazy.

12:27.342 --> 12:28.843
Okay, the thing is,

12:30.978 --> 12:33.781
all the sales
were off the books, cash.

12:33.815 --> 12:36.017
There never was paperwork.

12:37.219 --> 12:38.420
Wait.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.455
I don't understand.

12:40.888 --> 12:42.657
You were evading taxes?

12:42.690 --> 12:44.492
I'm not the only one,
believe me.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.261
How could you do that?

12:46.294 --> 12:48.796
Am I on trial
for not being a saint now?

12:48.830 --> 12:51.433
I paid millions
in taxes over my life,

12:51.466 --> 12:52.434
more than my share.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.602
Just how much
of your business

12:54.636 --> 12:55.470
was under the table?

12:55.503 --> 12:57.071
What the hell difference
does it make?

12:57.104 --> 12:58.773
I'm on trial for murder, not--

12:58.806 --> 13:00.141
I'm just trying to understand.

13:00.175 --> 13:01.276
DONNELL: Jimmy, let it go.

13:03.545 --> 13:06.581
D'AMBROSIO:
So, it's bad there's no proof

13:06.614 --> 13:08.416
he bought furniture.
What do we do?

13:08.450 --> 13:10.285
We got no choice.

13:11.018 --> 13:12.820
We stick with our original plan.

13:12.854 --> 13:14.055
There was no arson.

13:14.088 --> 13:15.790
The fire was accidental.

13:15.823 --> 13:17.259
Even if Tucker did set it,

13:17.292 --> 13:18.460
you weren't involved.

13:20.362 --> 13:23.665
It's not great,
but it's all we got.

13:34.108 --> 13:35.777
Did our lottery ticket hit?

13:35.810 --> 13:39.981
No, um, you're lucky in love.

13:40.014 --> 13:41.483
You came so late,
you missed The Singers.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.884
Don't tell me that--

13:42.917 --> 13:43.785
They were pretty good.
FRUTT: Yeah.

13:43.818 --> 13:45.653
You think Skip
will ask you to the prom?

13:45.687 --> 13:46.621
I'll drive you guys
if you want.

13:46.654 --> 13:47.589
Yeah.
HATCHER: You know what?

13:47.622 --> 13:48.490
This isn't funny.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.558
I'm gonna have to tell
Skip to stop it.

13:51.058 --> 13:52.760
You know how bad
that makes me feel?

13:57.699 --> 14:01.269
When the heat of the fire
reached 165 degrees,

14:01.303 --> 14:02.737
it set off the sprinkler system,

14:02.770 --> 14:04.472
and that dropped
the water pressure,

14:04.506 --> 14:06.874
which tripped an alarm
at dispatch.

14:06.908 --> 14:09.977
When did the first
engine company arrive?

14:10.011 --> 14:11.679
MAN: Within five minutes,
but by then,

14:11.713 --> 14:13.381
flashover had taken place.

14:13.415 --> 14:15.750
The fire burned so hot
and so fast,

14:15.783 --> 14:18.019
it literally exploded
the building.

14:18.052 --> 14:19.421
GAMBLE:
Where did the fire start?

14:19.454 --> 14:21.022
MAN: It had two points
of origin.

14:21.055 --> 14:25.159
Now, fires don't naturally
have two starting points,

14:25.193 --> 14:26.361
so we brought in a dog

14:26.394 --> 14:28.029
trained to sniff out
fire accelerants.

14:28.062 --> 14:29.564
GAMBLE: What did you find?

14:29.597 --> 14:31.299
MAN: The place had been
soaked in linseed oil.

14:31.333 --> 14:34.236
That's a common fire accelerant.

14:34.269 --> 14:36.171
GAMBLE: Did you review
a coroner's report

14:36.204 --> 14:37.305
of the man who died?

14:37.339 --> 14:38.740
I did.

14:38.773 --> 14:40.175
The position of the body

14:40.208 --> 14:41.676
and the pink flesh
in the trachea

14:41.709 --> 14:43.945
show that he did not die
of smoke inhalation.

14:43.978 --> 14:45.547
He burned to death.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.216
Combustion was so quick
and so intense,

14:48.250 --> 14:50.618
it was more like a bomb
than a fire.

14:51.486 --> 14:53.555
BERLUTI: Before the fire
was even out,

14:53.588 --> 14:55.657
you assumed this was arson?

14:55.690 --> 14:57.825
I assume all fires
are arson

14:57.859 --> 14:59.126
until I can prove
otherwise.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.197
But you had no direct evidence
this was arson.

15:02.230 --> 15:04.732
Unless we catch them
at the scene holding a match,

15:04.766 --> 15:05.667
we never do.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.635
BERLUTI: Did you check
the electrical system

15:07.669 --> 15:09.471
to see if that could
have caused the fire?

15:09.504 --> 15:11.206
We didn't find
any system failures.

15:11.239 --> 15:12.707
There still
could have been one?

15:12.740 --> 15:14.576
It's possible but--

15:14.609 --> 15:16.878
Your report says
you found

15:16.911 --> 15:18.346
forced entry
into the building.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.915
I found a door
had been kicked open,

15:20.948 --> 15:22.116
but that could
have been one of our men

15:22.149 --> 15:23.385
ventilating smoke.

15:23.418 --> 15:25.453
BERLUTI: Or a homeless
person could have broken in

15:25.487 --> 15:28.523
to get warm and accidentally
caused the fire.

15:28.556 --> 15:30.192
It was cold that night.

15:30.225 --> 15:31.759
Isn't that possible?

15:31.959 --> 15:33.094
Yes, but--

15:33.127 --> 15:34.262
BERLUTI:
You just told Ms. Gamble

15:34.296 --> 15:36.731
the place was soaked
in linseed oil,

15:36.764 --> 15:39.401
but your report said
you didn't smell any.

15:39.434 --> 15:41.068
It's possible
the fire was so hot

15:41.102 --> 15:42.604
it burned off that evidence.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.372
BERLUTI: Couldn't something
else in the warehouse

15:44.406 --> 15:46.474
have contributed
to the fire's heat?

15:46.508 --> 15:48.776
They use lacquer
to finish tables,

15:48.810 --> 15:49.777
solvents, thinners,

15:49.811 --> 15:51.879
all of which can combust
when it's hot.

15:51.913 --> 15:54.549
But as you said,
it was cold that night,

15:54.582 --> 15:57.185
so that kind of combustion
is not possible.

15:57.219 --> 15:59.086
Plus, the dog didn't alert
to other fuels,

15:59.120 --> 16:00.788
meaning they weren't there.

16:00.822 --> 16:03.358
Or they were,
but like you said,

16:03.391 --> 16:04.992
the fire was so hot,

16:05.026 --> 16:06.394
it burned them all up.

16:12.934 --> 16:14.669
If you're gonna play the theme
from "Ice Castles" again--

16:14.702 --> 16:15.803
How did you know?

16:18.005 --> 16:19.974
You know,
don't say anything.

16:20.007 --> 16:21.276
Just come here.

16:23.878 --> 16:25.613
What are you doing?

16:25.647 --> 16:27.182
I don't like to give
these people material

16:27.215 --> 16:28.149
to make fun of me with.

16:28.183 --> 16:29.150
SKIP: I'm sorry.

16:29.184 --> 16:31.118
I just really wanna show
you how I feel.

16:31.152 --> 16:33.255
I know, okay?

16:33.288 --> 16:34.856
I know.

16:34.889 --> 16:37.158
You're embarrassing me
by sending flowers

16:37.192 --> 16:38.159
and showing up like this.

16:38.193 --> 16:40.428
You're the most beautiful,

16:40.462 --> 16:42.697
most special woman
I have ever seen.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.366
Oh, Skip...

16:44.399 --> 16:45.300
SKIP: You are.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.502
My whole life
I've always thought

16:47.535 --> 16:49.871
if you want something
and you work hard

16:49.904 --> 16:52.207
and believe enough,
you can have it.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.277
Why do you talk about me
like I'm a school project?

16:55.310 --> 16:58.246
I would do anything for you.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.316
My parents were young
when they met.

17:02.850 --> 17:06.188
Lucy, I love you.

17:11.425 --> 17:15.029
I want you to take this
with my heart.

17:17.499 --> 17:19.634
I know it'll be tough
because we're young,

17:19.666 --> 17:22.436
but I think
we can be happy.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.580
I have absolutely no idea
what to say to this.

17:33.415 --> 17:34.882
Just don't say no.

17:41.256 --> 17:43.491
GAMBLE: Had the defendant
recently increased

17:43.525 --> 17:45.260
his fire insurance policy?

17:45.293 --> 17:48.230
A month before the fire,
he doubled it.

17:48.263 --> 17:51.199
The warehouse
was insured for $6,000,000,

17:51.233 --> 17:53.901
the stock,
an additional 2,000,000.

17:53.935 --> 17:56.538
After the fire,
did he file a claim?

17:56.571 --> 17:58.039
MAN: For the full amount.

17:58.072 --> 17:59.874
We conducted an investigation

17:59.907 --> 18:01.943
and found that
Mr. D'Ambrosio's business

18:01.976 --> 18:04.346
was losing money prior
to the fire.

18:04.379 --> 18:06.414
His orders had dried up,

18:06.448 --> 18:08.350
yet he was still manufacturing

18:08.383 --> 18:10.985
new merchandise to stock
his warehouse.

18:11.018 --> 18:12.387
GAMBLE: What did you do?

18:12.420 --> 18:14.789
MAN: We forwarded
our suspicions to the D. A.,

18:14.822 --> 18:16.658
along with our findings.

18:16.691 --> 18:18.526
But you paid
the claim anyway.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.661
Why would you do that?

18:19.694 --> 18:21.229
MAN: The law says
if we fail to make a payment

18:21.263 --> 18:23.598
within a reasonable time,
we can be sued

18:23.631 --> 18:26.801
for bad faith
and face triple damages.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.337
Juries don't like
insurance companies,

18:29.371 --> 18:31.273
and we didn't wanna risk
a trial.

18:31.873 --> 18:33.775
You didn't wanna risk
a trial.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.343
You'd rather my client
risk one.

18:35.377 --> 18:36.678
Is that a question?

18:36.711 --> 18:38.846
BERLUTI: If my client
is convicted of arson,

18:38.880 --> 18:41.416
he'll be ordered to pay
restitution to you,

18:41.449 --> 18:43.585
meaning you'll get
all your money back,

18:43.618 --> 18:44.886
plus interest.

18:44.919 --> 18:47.822
If he defrauded us,
I think we're entitled to that.

18:47.855 --> 18:50.258
You could also bring
a 93A fraud action

18:50.292 --> 18:53.127
against my client
and get triple damages,

18:53.160 --> 18:55.129
meaning your company
could end up

18:55.162 --> 18:56.964
making money off of this fire.

18:56.998 --> 18:58.233
I suppose.

18:58.266 --> 19:01.203
When you handed
the fire inspector your report,

19:01.236 --> 19:04.239
you were hoping they'd come
after Mr. D'Ambrosio.

19:04.272 --> 19:06.140
MAN: The law requires
that we report

19:06.174 --> 19:08.310
all suspicious fires.

19:08.343 --> 19:11.112
But you have the most to gain

19:11.145 --> 19:13.181
if my client
is convicted of arson.

19:13.215 --> 19:15.350
Arson costs
insurance companies

19:15.383 --> 19:18.553
billions of dollars,
which, frankly,

19:18.586 --> 19:20.822
we pass on to consumers.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.858
We all gain when arsonists
are punished.

19:23.891 --> 19:26.194
Move to strike, nonresponsive.

19:26.228 --> 19:28.296
Sorry, Mr. Berluti.
I'd say he responded

19:28.330 --> 19:30.097
very directly to your question.

19:30.131 --> 19:31.666
Objection overruled.

19:36.204 --> 19:38.373
So far, I say we played
them even.

19:38.406 --> 19:39.607
Which is good.

19:39.641 --> 19:42.310
DONNELL: Honestly, no.

19:42.844 --> 19:44.646
Trials have a momentum.

19:45.112 --> 19:47.349
People make up their mind
before closings.

19:47.382 --> 19:49.817
We wanted to create reasonable
doubt with the jury

19:49.851 --> 19:51.886
before Tucker got on the stand.

19:51.919 --> 19:53.888
BERLUTI: That stuff
about the insurance

19:53.921 --> 19:55.290
and your business going down--

19:55.323 --> 19:56.958
We knew they were gonna
bring that up.

19:56.991 --> 19:59.327
The whole country's
in an economic downturn.

19:59.361 --> 20:01.296
Every business has insurance.

20:01.329 --> 20:03.365
DONNELL: The point
is to have any chance at all.

20:03.398 --> 20:05.533
We need to take Tucker out.

20:07.235 --> 20:10.538
Bobby, I want you
to cross-examine Tucker.

20:11.539 --> 20:14.576
Mr. D'Ambrosio,
I'm preparing for that.

20:14.609 --> 20:17.179
Jimmy, you're getting
shelled in there.

20:17.212 --> 20:20.081
That Gamble, she scores
every time she gets up.

20:20.114 --> 20:22.284
I got a right to call
for relief.

20:22.317 --> 20:25.420
You're not doing the job.
I don't think that's fair.

20:25.453 --> 20:26.888
D'AMBROSIO:
I don't care what you think.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.890
They wanna put me
in prison for murder.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.192
You understand that?

20:30.225 --> 20:33.127
They're treating me like
I'm public enemy number one,

20:33.160 --> 20:34.529
like I'm from the gutter

20:34.562 --> 20:35.963
after I spent my whole life

20:35.997 --> 20:38.200
proving that I'm as good
as any of them.

20:38.233 --> 20:41.969
I can't afford to care
about your feelings.

20:42.003 --> 20:44.672
I got to be smart about this.

20:46.040 --> 20:49.311
I want the Irishman
to cross Tucker,

20:50.011 --> 20:51.213
not you.

21:02.089 --> 21:05.827
(phone ringing)

21:05.860 --> 21:07.795
It's him.
I can't answer it.

21:07.829 --> 21:09.897
I can't believe you got
engaged before me.

21:09.931 --> 21:11.166
I'm not engaged.

21:11.199 --> 21:12.434
DOLE: At least 2 karats.

21:12.467 --> 21:13.901
How much does that cost?
FRUTT: Yeah.

21:13.935 --> 21:15.136
I don't wanna know.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.604
At least $6,000.

21:17.405 --> 21:18.940
What are you gonna do?

21:18.973 --> 21:21.243
Well, I tried to give it back,

21:21.276 --> 21:22.877
but he wouldn't leave
until I promised

21:22.910 --> 21:24.212
to at least think about it.

21:24.246 --> 21:25.713
It is kind of sweet.

21:25.747 --> 21:26.914
HATCHER: I know.
(phone ringing)

21:28.283 --> 21:29.484
Hello, Skip.

21:31.219 --> 21:32.554
You're where?

21:34.155 --> 21:36.958
Listen to me, I don't care
how you feel right now.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.260
Don't say anything.

21:39.126 --> 21:40.628
No.

21:40.662 --> 21:41.663
Until we get there,

21:41.696 --> 21:43.531
do not speak to the FBI.

21:45.066 --> 21:46.734
Did you just say, "the FBI"?

21:46.768 --> 21:48.270
Skip's been arrested.

21:48.303 --> 21:49.070
For what?

21:49.103 --> 21:51.539
Something
about federal wire fraud.

21:54.842 --> 21:56.878
The police arrested me
at the scene.

21:56.911 --> 21:58.646
I was videotaping the fire.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.814
GAMBLE: You do that a lot?

21:59.847 --> 22:01.449
Only when I set them.

22:01.483 --> 22:02.717
The police
searched my house.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.319
They found
my whole collection.

22:04.352 --> 22:06.254
How did you
set this fire?

22:06.288 --> 22:08.523
I soaked some fabric
with fuel.

22:08.556 --> 22:10.958
There was a bolt of upholstery
in the warehouse,

22:10.992 --> 22:13.928
a very nice flame
stitch pattern,

22:13.961 --> 22:15.363
which seemed
appropriate.

22:15.397 --> 22:16.998
What kind of fuel
did you use?

22:17.031 --> 22:20.302
That dog was right,
linseed oil.

22:20.335 --> 22:22.504
GAMBLE: Tell us how
you ignited the fire.

22:22.537 --> 22:24.506
NORMAN: Not wanting
to burn myself up,

22:24.539 --> 22:26.073
I used a delay device.

22:26.107 --> 22:28.310
All you need
is a lit cigarette.

22:28.343 --> 22:30.678
Why did you set
this fire?

22:30.712 --> 22:32.880
My ex-wife's lady lawyer

22:32.914 --> 22:35.250
got her a huge alimony.

22:35.283 --> 22:37.552
So when D'Ambrosio
complained

22:37.585 --> 22:39.821
that his business
was tubing,

22:39.854 --> 22:43.325
I offered to burn it down
for $50,000.

22:43.358 --> 22:45.427
GAMBLE: When did you make
this offer?

22:45.460 --> 22:47.495
One week before I did it.

22:47.529 --> 22:49.864
We met on the commons
in the middle of the day.

22:49.897 --> 22:51.499
How did he pay you?

22:51.533 --> 22:53.735
Upfront, in cash.

22:54.502 --> 22:57.004
We did all our business
in cash.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.842
DONNELL: How many fires
have you set in your life?

23:00.875 --> 23:02.610
That's like asking me
how many times

23:02.644 --> 23:03.645
I beat my ex-wife.

23:03.678 --> 23:05.247
I can't remember
exactly.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.848
DONNELL: By testifying
against my client,

23:06.881 --> 23:08.583
you get a pass
on those fires?

23:08.616 --> 23:10.318
I better.
DONNELL: And a reduced sentence

23:10.352 --> 23:12.354
for felony murder
of the night watchman

23:12.387 --> 23:13.255
in this case?

23:13.721 --> 23:15.323
I deserve that.

23:15.357 --> 23:17.091
I never meant
to hurt anyone.

23:17.124 --> 23:18.593
DONNELL:
Your obsession with fire,

23:18.626 --> 23:22.530
you ever gratify yourself
sexually watching a fire?

23:22.564 --> 23:23.831
Have you?

23:23.865 --> 23:25.032
Answer the question.

23:27.068 --> 23:28.636
Yeah, I've done that.

23:28.670 --> 23:32.774
DONNELL: So, your motive for
setting fires isn't economic.

23:32.807 --> 23:34.442
You never set them
for money before.

23:35.009 --> 23:37.179
No, this is the first time
I took money for it.

23:37.212 --> 23:38.713
Ever lie about
setting a fire?

23:38.746 --> 23:40.482
To avoid getting caught?
Yeah.

23:40.515 --> 23:42.684
Like you're lying now
to avoid punishment?

23:42.717 --> 23:45.653
I am not lying now,
Mr. Donnell.

23:45.687 --> 23:48.290
DONNELL: Nobody can verify
any part of your story

23:48.323 --> 23:49.557
about getting paid
for this.

23:49.591 --> 23:50.825
Your client could.

23:50.858 --> 23:52.360
Move to strike.
KIMBALL: Sustained.

23:52.394 --> 23:53.861
The jury will disregard.

23:53.895 --> 23:55.397
DONNELL: Mr. Tucker,
isn't it a fact

23:55.430 --> 23:57.098
that you approached the D. A.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.601
and suggested
you'd accuse my client?

23:59.634 --> 24:01.269
It seemed like
a good idea.

24:01.303 --> 24:03.137
DONNELL: You say my client
gave you a key

24:03.171 --> 24:04.572
to the warehouse.
Where is it?

24:04.606 --> 24:05.640
I lost it.

24:05.673 --> 24:06.874
DONNELL: What about the money?

24:07.642 --> 24:09.644
Sorry?
The $50,000

24:09.677 --> 24:11.012
you say my client gave you,

24:11.045 --> 24:12.314
where is it?

24:12.347 --> 24:13.448
You wouldn't believe me.

24:13.481 --> 24:14.816
Try me.

24:16.418 --> 24:17.952
It burnt in the fire.

24:17.985 --> 24:19.421
I left it behind
in the warehouse.

24:19.454 --> 24:21.623
I always wanted to have
money to burn.

24:21.656 --> 24:24.592
You were right. I didn't do it
for money after all.

24:24.626 --> 24:26.194
You're so smart.

24:26.728 --> 24:29.331
You're not,
not if you expect this jury

24:29.364 --> 24:30.765
to believe that story.

24:32.534 --> 24:34.101
Nothing further.

24:34.135 --> 24:36.137
(music playing)

24:49.251 --> 24:51.419
Your boyfriend ran
a pyramid scheme.

24:51.453 --> 24:52.587
He's not
my boyfriend.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.988
Lucy, please.

24:54.021 --> 24:55.790
What do you people think
Skip did?

24:55.823 --> 24:59.561
He promised a million-dollar
return on a $25 investment.

24:59.594 --> 25:00.795
How?

25:00.828 --> 25:02.464
Through a chain
letter email.

25:02.497 --> 25:04.098
Each person sends out
five dollars

25:04.131 --> 25:05.099
to five other people,

25:05.132 --> 25:07.034
one of whom
is always Hyman.

25:07.068 --> 25:08.770
Then they forward the email

25:08.803 --> 25:10.104
to as many people
as possible.

25:10.137 --> 25:12.006
Hyman got five dollars

25:12.039 --> 25:14.309
from fourteen hundred
people.

25:15.109 --> 25:17.245
He must have used that money
to buy the ring.

25:18.112 --> 25:19.847
He's not even 18.

25:19.881 --> 25:22.016
I thought the feds
didn't do juvie cases.

25:22.049 --> 25:23.951
We don't unless
there's federal jurisdiction.

25:23.985 --> 25:25.620
He committed
federal wire fraud.

25:25.953 --> 25:27.489
The U. S. attorney must

25:27.522 --> 25:29.123
have better things
to do than this.

25:29.156 --> 25:31.426
Oh, we always have time

25:31.459 --> 25:32.860
for high visibility cases.

25:32.894 --> 25:34.128
Wait a minute.
You're putting out

25:34.161 --> 25:35.397
a press release on this?

25:35.430 --> 25:37.064
For deterrent purposes?
Absolutely.

25:37.098 --> 25:38.800
You're gonna ruin
this kid's life!

25:40.768 --> 25:42.404
How much trouble is he in?

25:42.437 --> 25:43.638
Fourteen hundred
separate counts

25:43.671 --> 25:45.707
of wire fraud
at five per.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.675
Seven thousand years?

25:47.709 --> 25:49.010
Only if they run
consecutively.

25:49.043 --> 25:50.077
The good news is

25:50.111 --> 25:52.079
we've decided
you were not involved.

25:52.447 --> 25:53.381
Me?

25:53.415 --> 25:54.782
What makes you think
she was involved?

25:54.816 --> 25:56.484
She barely knows Skip.

25:56.951 --> 25:58.052
Oh, really?

25:58.520 --> 26:00.855
Then why did he spend the night
at her place?

26:01.956 --> 26:03.358
Ellenor,

26:03.391 --> 26:04.792
not here.

26:05.327 --> 26:06.528
Not now.

26:11.866 --> 26:14.035
They arrested me
at a track meet.

26:15.537 --> 26:17.339
They even took my spikes.

26:17.772 --> 26:19.274
Skip,
where's your mom?

26:20.408 --> 26:21.709
I didn't call her.

26:22.244 --> 26:23.445
I called Lucy.

26:23.478 --> 26:25.280
You need to call her.

26:25.313 --> 26:28.316
I wanna introduce you
when it's right,

26:28.350 --> 26:30.385
not now like this.

26:30.418 --> 26:33.120
What were you thinking
with that chain letter?

26:33.154 --> 26:35.990
I swear I didn't know
it was illegal.

26:36.023 --> 26:37.692
Someone sent it
to me first.

26:37.725 --> 26:40.094
It doesn't matter!
Please,

26:40.127 --> 26:42.129
don't let this affect
your decision.

26:42.163 --> 26:43.865
We can still be happy.

26:47.402 --> 26:50.638
D'AMBROSIO: I have to admit
I did cash business with Tucker.

26:50.672 --> 26:53.140
DONNELL: You need to explain
how it is you knew him

26:53.175 --> 26:54.876
and why there is no proof.

26:54.909 --> 26:56.878
I'll have the IRS
all over me.

26:56.911 --> 26:58.780
DONNELL: You rather get
convicted of murder?

26:58.813 --> 27:00.682
You need to testify.

27:00.715 --> 27:02.550
If you don't,
the jury will think

27:02.584 --> 27:05.152
you're hiding something.
I got nothing to hide.

27:05.187 --> 27:07.322
I do business
just like they do it

27:07.355 --> 27:08.690
up on Beacon Hill,

27:08.723 --> 27:10.592
only they don't charge them
with murder.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.627
Can't he take the fifth
on the taxes?

27:12.660 --> 27:14.396
If he does, his whole testimony
will be struck,

27:14.429 --> 27:16.931
and that he will definitely
be convicted.

27:16.964 --> 27:18.566
If you had crossed
Tucker better,

27:18.600 --> 27:20.268
I wouldn't have to testify.

27:20.302 --> 27:21.869
You know what?
I've had enough of this.

27:21.903 --> 27:23.938
I haven't said anything before
out of respect to Jimmy,

27:23.971 --> 27:24.972
but you're out of line.

27:25.006 --> 27:26.508
Hey, I'm paying
for performance here,

27:26.541 --> 27:28.676
not excuses.
End of story.

27:29.677 --> 27:31.846
I'm putting you
back in charge.

27:31.879 --> 27:34.782
(music playing)

27:40.422 --> 27:41.923
They just called.

27:41.956 --> 27:43.391
D'Ambrosio's testifying.

27:43.425 --> 27:44.726
He's up after lunch.

27:44.759 --> 27:46.994
That's good.
Is it?

27:47.028 --> 27:49.264
The defendant doesn't take
the stand unless he has to.

27:49.297 --> 27:51.166
Or unless
he's got a good story.

27:51.933 --> 27:53.468
Better be good
after Tucker.

27:53.501 --> 27:56.037
I wasn't so thrilled
by his performance.

27:56.338 --> 27:57.772
He did enough.

27:57.805 --> 27:59.040
GAMBLE: He looked like something

27:59.073 --> 28:00.775
that just crawled
out of the toilet.

28:00.808 --> 28:02.710
The jury knows
what's going on.

28:02.744 --> 28:04.246
They know
D'Ambrosio's guilty.

28:04.279 --> 28:06.080
I'm not so sure
I agree.

28:06.113 --> 28:07.215
I don't care.

28:09.083 --> 28:12.019
I can't afford
your internal debates, Helen.

28:12.587 --> 28:14.722
We've been losing too much.

28:14.756 --> 28:16.524
It's hard enough
to win these cases

28:16.558 --> 28:17.692
without you second-guessing

28:17.725 --> 28:19.561
our motives and methods.

28:20.695 --> 28:22.464
(sighs)
If you can't do the job,

28:22.497 --> 28:23.865
then get the hell out.

28:24.199 --> 28:25.600
But until you do,

28:25.633 --> 28:28.170
you go after D'Ambrosio hard

28:28.203 --> 28:30.205
and win this case.

28:36.944 --> 28:39.547
I've been in business
a long time.

28:39.581 --> 28:41.316
A lot of companies
went overseas

28:41.349 --> 28:43.117
or down south
to save money.

28:43.150 --> 28:45.220
I stayed in Boston.

28:45.253 --> 28:46.288
I've done a lot of good

28:46.321 --> 28:48.556
by giving jobs
to a lot of people.

28:48.590 --> 28:50.558
It's never just been
about money,

28:50.592 --> 28:51.793
not to me.

28:51.826 --> 28:53.661
The people in my business,

28:53.695 --> 28:55.430
they're family,

28:55.463 --> 28:58.166
and I would never hurt
my family.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.802
BERLUTI: Do you deny
knowing Norman Tucker?

29:00.835 --> 29:02.704
No, he was my customer.

29:02.737 --> 29:05.072
I sold him furniture
for several years.

29:05.106 --> 29:07.809
BERLUTI: Did you hire him
to burn your business?

29:07.842 --> 29:10.345
Absolutely not.

29:10.845 --> 29:11.946
I have nothing further.

29:17.552 --> 29:19.321
There's no record
that you ever sold

29:19.354 --> 29:20.988
any furniture
to Mr. Tucker.

29:21.022 --> 29:24.492
It was done in cash
to avoid taxes.

29:24.526 --> 29:25.793
That was wrong.

29:25.827 --> 29:26.728
I admit it.

29:27.195 --> 29:28.630
What about
the chemical dumping?

29:28.663 --> 29:29.797
Do you admit
that was wrong?

29:29.831 --> 29:30.998
Objection, relevance.

29:31.032 --> 29:32.500
GAMBLE: Goes to motive.
Your Honor,

29:32.534 --> 29:34.302
the EPA was investigating
the warehouse

29:34.336 --> 29:35.837
for illegal waste disposal.

29:35.870 --> 29:37.972
The fire made
the investigation moot.

29:38.005 --> 29:39.006
Overruled.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.608
D'AMBROSIO:
I'm an American businessman.

29:40.642 --> 29:42.910
I'm used to being
overregulated.

29:42.944 --> 29:45.380
I don't burn my business
because of it.

29:45.413 --> 29:46.914
Business for you was bad.

29:46.948 --> 29:48.816
Business goes in cycles.

29:48.850 --> 29:50.752
It goes up, it goes down.

29:50.785 --> 29:53.488
You had operating losses
for six straight quarters.

29:53.521 --> 29:54.922
D'AMBROSIO:
I don't shrivel up and die

29:54.956 --> 29:57.325
because of a bad streak.
I work through it.

29:57.359 --> 29:58.626
I was coming back.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.362
The fire came just in time

30:00.395 --> 30:02.096
to save you
from losing your shirt.

30:02.129 --> 30:03.565
D'AMBROSIO:
Times were tough, yes,

30:03.598 --> 30:06.468
but it didn't stop me
from serving on charity boards,

30:06.501 --> 30:08.936
raising money for a new hospital
in the north end,

30:08.970 --> 30:11.138
paying my employees on time.

30:11.173 --> 30:14.108
I didn't commit any crime.

30:14.141 --> 30:16.178
Mr. Tucker
was your customer.

30:16.844 --> 30:19.113
When was the last time
you two met?

30:19.581 --> 30:20.782
I don't remember.

30:20.815 --> 30:22.484
If we have a witness
who says

30:22.517 --> 30:24.252
he saw you with him
on the commons

30:24.286 --> 30:26.454
one week before the fire,

30:26.488 --> 30:29.156
would that refresh
your recollection?

30:34.196 --> 30:35.597
No, it wouldn't.

30:37.199 --> 30:39.066
You don't sound so sure.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.068
Objection!
Withdrawn.

30:46.908 --> 30:48.510
I have nothing further.

30:49.010 --> 30:51.979
(music playing)

31:06.994 --> 31:08.863
HATCHER: It's been going on
for six weeks,

31:08.896 --> 31:10.832
from when he first fixed
the computers.

31:11.666 --> 31:13.268
It was the end of the day.

31:13.301 --> 31:14.636
We talked...

31:14.669 --> 31:16.171
to begin with.

31:17.272 --> 31:18.906
He's really smart

31:18.940 --> 31:20.975
and he's got this energy.

31:21.008 --> 31:23.211
It's just
the age difference.

31:23.245 --> 31:25.180
He told me he was 18.

31:25.213 --> 31:27.615
Besides,
I never slept with him.

31:27.649 --> 31:30.084
He just stayed over one night
'cause it was late.

31:30.117 --> 31:33.255
Lucy, I am the last person
to judge anyone

31:33.288 --> 31:35.357
about things like this,
believe me.

31:35.957 --> 31:37.859
I don't know
how it happened,

31:39.461 --> 31:42.330
but there's a part of me
that really likes him.

31:42.364 --> 31:44.532
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

31:44.566 --> 31:46.901
It's just--
BETSY: Lucy Hatcher?

31:46.934 --> 31:48.503
I'm, uh, Skip's mom

31:48.536 --> 31:49.171
Betsy Hyman.

31:49.204 --> 31:51.306
Oh. Hi.

31:51.339 --> 31:53.208
I'm really sorry that
we had to meet like this.

31:54.008 --> 31:55.410
Skip is right.

31:56.244 --> 31:57.679
You are very pretty.

31:59.281 --> 32:00.348
As a mother,

32:00.382 --> 32:04.018
you worry who your son
will fall for.

32:05.187 --> 32:07.255
Too bad Skip fell
for such a slut.

32:07.289 --> 32:09.757
Hey!
BETSY: My son was perfect,

32:09.791 --> 32:11.426
then he meets you.

32:11.459 --> 32:12.860
Now he's a criminal!

32:16.063 --> 32:17.532
A man is dead,

32:17.565 --> 32:19.634
a business is ruined

32:20.868 --> 32:22.804
all because of greed.

32:22.837 --> 32:25.740
Ronald D'Ambrosio
may not have lit the match,

32:25.773 --> 32:27.842
but he's the one
who started the fire

32:27.875 --> 32:30.345
the day he hired
Norman Tucker

32:30.378 --> 32:31.813
to torch his warehouse.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.382
But for D'Ambrosio,

32:34.416 --> 32:36.718
the fire never happens

32:36.751 --> 32:40.222
and the night watchman
is never burned alive.

32:40.588 --> 32:42.824
See, most arson cases
are based

32:42.857 --> 32:44.426
on circumstantial evidence.

32:44.459 --> 32:45.860
This one isn't.

32:46.228 --> 32:48.830
Norman Tucker
gave direct testimony

32:48.863 --> 32:50.365
against the defendant.

32:50.398 --> 32:54.736
He told you how he committed
the crime and why,

32:54.769 --> 32:56.371
money.

32:56.938 --> 33:00.275
Norman Tucker wanted to earn
some by lighting a fire.

33:00.308 --> 33:02.477
D'Ambrosio
wanted to earn some

33:02.510 --> 33:04.179
through insurance fraud.

33:04.812 --> 33:06.348
You may not like Tucker.

33:06.714 --> 33:08.750
You may be disgusted by him.

33:10.084 --> 33:11.219
I am.

33:12.086 --> 33:14.322
But the fact remains,

33:14.356 --> 33:17.325
Tucker pled guilty
to an arson

33:17.359 --> 33:20.495
that the defendant
paid him to commit.

33:20.962 --> 33:23.130
When you have
a criminal conspiracy,

33:23.565 --> 33:25.132
you can't expect to find

33:25.167 --> 33:27.335
nice people involved.

33:27.369 --> 33:30.305
We didn't choose Tucker
as a witness.

33:30.672 --> 33:32.740
D'Ambrosio chose him

33:32.774 --> 33:34.809
to be a partner in crime.

33:36.211 --> 33:38.913
You stick a crook
in a nice suit,

33:39.281 --> 33:40.782
he's still a crook.

33:42.884 --> 33:44.752
Ronald D'Ambrosio

33:45.453 --> 33:46.854
is a crook.

33:48.623 --> 33:52.059
BERLUTI: My client has been
a pillar of the community

33:52.093 --> 33:53.528
for almost
half a century.

33:54.061 --> 33:55.630
You could argue

33:55.663 --> 33:58.065
that they should build
a statue for him.

33:58.266 --> 33:59.801
Instead,

33:59.834 --> 34:01.936
they charge him with murder.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.506
My client thinks

34:04.539 --> 34:06.841
what they really blame him for

34:06.874 --> 34:09.277
is being an Italian-American.

34:10.011 --> 34:12.847
He thinks if his name
was Cabot or Lodge,

34:12.880 --> 34:14.748
they would never
have charged him.

34:15.250 --> 34:16.650
I don't know.

34:16.684 --> 34:18.553
There's been so many bad movies

34:18.585 --> 34:21.356
and overhyped
television shows,

34:21.389 --> 34:23.257
maybe people do think

34:23.291 --> 34:25.860
if you're a successful
Italian-American,

34:25.893 --> 34:28.230
you must be mobbed up.

34:28.896 --> 34:30.431
I know this,

34:30.465 --> 34:33.268
having insurance
is not a motive.

34:33.301 --> 34:36.838
Filing an insurance claim
is not a crime.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.706
They didn't even prove
this was arson

34:39.741 --> 34:41.708
beyond a reasonable doubt.

34:41.743 --> 34:44.312
And they never presented
any evidence

34:44.346 --> 34:46.981
linking my client
to any arson

34:47.014 --> 34:48.216
involving Norman Tucker.

34:48.916 --> 34:50.952
Their whole case
is built

34:50.985 --> 34:52.018
on the testimony

34:52.053 --> 34:54.589
of a demented,
admitted liar

34:54.621 --> 34:58.626
who may or may not
have started this fire,

34:58.660 --> 35:01.763
but who says he sexually
gratifies himself

35:01.796 --> 35:03.831
watching buildings burn.

35:03.865 --> 35:05.933
When the government
gets into bed

35:05.967 --> 35:08.470
with lowlifes
like Norman Tucker,

35:08.503 --> 35:10.438
it ought to make you mad.

35:10.905 --> 35:13.341
Don't convict
an innocent man

35:13.375 --> 35:15.577
on the basis
of bought testimony

35:15.610 --> 35:17.212
from a crazy man.

35:18.813 --> 35:20.682
Ronald D'Ambrosio...

35:21.483 --> 35:23.117
is not guilty.

35:27.189 --> 35:29.090
A Brooklyn plan
for this guy?

35:29.123 --> 35:31.058
FRUTT: Yes. He pleads
to one felony.

35:31.092 --> 35:33.628
If he keeps his nose clean,
you expunge the conviction.

35:33.661 --> 35:35.963
Please.
He's a good boy.

35:36.631 --> 35:37.865
I don't know.

35:44.339 --> 35:46.374
He'll have to make
full restitution

35:46.408 --> 35:48.310
and immediately forfeit
any property

35:48.343 --> 35:49.611
bought with
criminal proceeds.

35:51.513 --> 35:53.147
Can I talk to Skip
for a minute?

35:53.181 --> 35:54.682
Stay out of this!

35:54.716 --> 35:55.683
Mrs. Hyman, please.

35:55.717 --> 35:56.918
Maybe this could help.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.855
Lucy, please don't.

36:00.888 --> 36:02.524
I'm sorry.

36:02.557 --> 36:04.726
I'm just not ready
for that kind of a commitment.

36:04.759 --> 36:07.462
I love you.
Oh, for God's sake!

36:07.495 --> 36:09.497
Maybe we should give them
a little privacy.

36:09.531 --> 36:10.598
If it's the ring,

36:10.632 --> 36:12.334
I'll get you another one,
please.

36:12.367 --> 36:13.335
It's not the ring.

36:15.203 --> 36:16.538
I care for you,

36:16.971 --> 36:18.506
but this is just way too--

36:18.540 --> 36:19.641
Give me that!

36:22.410 --> 36:24.546
My son is taking the deal.

36:24.579 --> 36:25.713
He'll plead guilty.

36:27.849 --> 36:29.384
And you,

36:29.417 --> 36:32.220
stay the hell away
from my son!

36:36.891 --> 36:39.827
(music playing)

36:48.770 --> 36:50.805
Jimmy, take my Rolex.

36:51.906 --> 36:53.608
If they take me
into custody,

36:53.641 --> 36:55.743
I don't want the guards
to steal it.

37:06.654 --> 37:08.256
Will the defendant
please rise?

37:11.426 --> 37:12.927
Has the jury reached
a verdict?

37:13.761 --> 37:14.529
We have, Your Honor.

37:15.430 --> 37:17.064
KIMBALL: As to the charge
of conspiracy

37:17.098 --> 37:19.334
to commit arson
with intent to defraud

37:19.367 --> 37:21.869
and felony murder,
how say you?

37:22.437 --> 37:24.406
WOMAN: We the jury
find the defendant

37:24.439 --> 37:25.973
Ronald D'Ambrosio

37:26.974 --> 37:28.109
not guilty.

37:29.677 --> 37:32.013
KIMBALL: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, I thank you.

37:32.046 --> 37:33.748
This concludes your service
to the commonwealth.

37:34.115 --> 37:35.683
This Court is adjourned.

37:35.717 --> 37:36.384
(gavel bangs)

37:47.028 --> 37:49.197
Wow, what a relief.

37:50.165 --> 37:51.666
Thank you both.

37:55.002 --> 37:55.737
Jimmy,

37:56.671 --> 37:58.139
you're a good man.

38:00.208 --> 38:02.076
Right.
You saved me

38:02.109 --> 38:04.446
from being
wrongly convicted.

38:05.146 --> 38:07.148
Not that it didn't cost,

38:07.182 --> 38:08.416
what you made on this case

38:08.450 --> 38:09.851
would have taken
your old man

38:09.884 --> 38:11.453
five years to make.

38:11.486 --> 38:14.456
He would have been
so proud of you.

38:15.623 --> 38:16.991
You think
you knew my father?

38:17.292 --> 38:18.159
Jimmy.

38:19.327 --> 38:20.495
Didn't I?

38:21.629 --> 38:23.298
My father admired you.

38:23.331 --> 38:25.167
I admired him.

38:26.268 --> 38:29.571
Blue-collar guy,
son becomes a lawyer.

38:29.604 --> 38:31.473
That's the American dream.

38:31.939 --> 38:33.575
You didn't know my father.

38:34.242 --> 38:35.877
What are you talking about?

38:38.380 --> 38:41.115
A clerk once gave him
too much change,

38:41.148 --> 38:42.717
maybe two dollars.

38:43.385 --> 38:45.687
He realized
when he got home,

38:45.720 --> 38:48.022
drove 10 miles in the rain

38:48.055 --> 38:49.457
to give it back.

38:50.091 --> 38:52.026
The man couldn't lie.

38:52.894 --> 38:54.362
And I used to think,

38:54.762 --> 38:55.930
"What a chump.

38:56.364 --> 38:57.632
He has so little,

38:57.665 --> 39:00.302
and he doesn't even know
how the world works."

39:01.403 --> 39:02.737
He paid his taxes,

39:03.238 --> 39:04.572
waited his turn,

39:05.072 --> 39:07.041
played by the rules.

39:07.509 --> 39:09.777
He was so naive,

39:09.811 --> 39:12.214
he thought guys
like you did, too.

39:15.016 --> 39:16.718
Mr. D'Ambrosio,

39:17.852 --> 39:20.522
my father was a better man

39:20.555 --> 39:22.590
than I will ever be.

39:24.392 --> 39:26.428
I wish I could
tell him that

39:31.466 --> 39:34.969
and tell him the kind of
a guy you really are.

39:39.441 --> 39:40.675
Jimmy,

39:41.443 --> 39:43.077
I was innocent.

39:46.214 --> 39:49.484
If your father
thought I was a hero,

39:49.517 --> 39:50.785
well,

39:51.253 --> 39:53.455
maybe he was wrong.

39:53.488 --> 39:55.089
I'm sorry.

39:56.291 --> 39:57.992
The truth is...

39:59.627 --> 40:01.996
I'm just a businessman.

40:14.742 --> 40:17.111
I waited till the last minute
to plead

40:17.144 --> 40:19.314
because I knew Walsh
would be desperate

40:19.347 --> 40:20.915
and he'd give me
a good deal.

40:20.948 --> 40:23.418
GAMBLE: I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

40:23.451 --> 40:25.720
did Mr. Walsh
encourage you

40:25.753 --> 40:29.357
to falsely incriminate
D'Ambrosio or not?

40:29.391 --> 40:32.760
If I admit lying
on the stand,

40:32.794 --> 40:35.763
I wouldn't get a reduced
sentence for the fire

40:35.797 --> 40:40.335
unless you wanna give me
a bigger break

40:40.368 --> 40:42.170
for giving up Walsh.

40:45.139 --> 40:46.208
No.

40:47.175 --> 40:49.377
You're still
gonna serve time.

40:49.411 --> 40:50.912
You need to go away

40:50.945 --> 40:52.980
for as long as possible.

40:53.014 --> 40:54.216
You can't prove

40:54.249 --> 40:57.151
that my testimony
was untruthful.

40:57.185 --> 40:59.887
You still have to give me
a reduced sentence.

40:59.921 --> 41:01.055
GAMBLE: Unfortunately.

41:01.789 --> 41:03.591
Goodbye, Mr. Tucker.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.893
NORMAN: I'm sorry
I can't help.

41:05.927 --> 41:08.530
I know it'd make you feel
so much better

41:08.563 --> 41:09.831
to blame Walsh.

41:09.864 --> 41:12.066
You're such
a team player.

41:13.735 --> 41:15.970
Walsh wanted
to believe me.

41:16.671 --> 41:18.240
What was your excuse?

41:20.175 --> 41:22.177
Whenever you got close
to asking me

41:22.210 --> 41:23.978
about the details
of the fire,

41:24.011 --> 41:25.580
about the key,

41:25.613 --> 41:27.682
all I had to do
was insult you,

41:27.715 --> 41:30.252
and you forgot
to pursue it.

41:30.785 --> 41:32.954
A good prosecutor
would have known

41:32.987 --> 41:34.956
I was lying
the whole time,

41:35.623 --> 41:37.359
ambitious

41:37.392 --> 41:39.627
and incompetent.

41:39.661 --> 41:42.964
They'll make you a Judge
if you're not careful.

41:44.432 --> 41:46.000
Turns out,
I burnt the place

41:46.033 --> 41:48.069
'cause I hated
the style of the furniture

41:48.102 --> 41:50.004
that it made
such a big fire.

41:54.609 --> 41:56.844
Of course,
I never said any of this.

41:58.045 --> 41:59.514
Good night, honey.

42:01.015 --> 42:02.450
Guard!

42:02.484 --> 42:05.420
(music playing)

42:24.872 --> 42:26.808
MAN: Next on The Practice.

42:27.175 --> 42:28.042
Who did you kill?

42:28.075 --> 42:29.644
Why don't we start
by asking

42:29.677 --> 42:32.013
where I've been
for the last three years?

42:32.046 --> 42:33.815
Law School.
You're a lawyer?

42:33.848 --> 42:35.350
I've got a case now.
That's why I'm here.

42:35.383 --> 42:37.452
My conscience says I should
get another lawyer onboard

42:37.485 --> 42:38.353
with experience.

42:38.386 --> 42:39.721
Come on. What do you say?

42:39.921 --> 42:41.923
You, me, Ellie,

42:41.956 --> 42:43.157
it'll be fun.

42:44.559 --> 42:45.993
Jennifer called.

42:46.027 --> 42:47.128
She was raped last night.

42:47.161 --> 42:48.396
It was a trick.

42:48.430 --> 42:49.764
He just went crazy.

42:49.797 --> 42:52.066
GAMBLE: Jimmy,
the examination didn't reveal

42:52.099 --> 42:53.968
any vaginal bruising
or tearing.

42:54.001 --> 42:54.836
Did you see her face?

42:54.869 --> 42:56.571
Do you think
she did that to herself?

42:56.604 --> 42:58.706
This is a hooker
with a drug problem.

42:59.174 --> 43:00.608
I'm not that good a D. A.

43:02.977 --> 43:05.947
(music playing)

43:29.371 --> 43:30.372
WOMAN: You stinker!
