00:23.565 --> 00:26.318
Is that signal really coming from space?

00:26.401 --> 00:27.819
It sure is, Charlie Brown.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.283
It sounds like
when my dolly's running out of batteries.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.411
Or a washing machine full of baseballs.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.789
Or a barking dog.

00:40.874 --> 00:45.921
Wow, imagine that. Intelligent dog life
somewhere among the stars.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.575
Ha! Intelligent dog life?
That'd be a first.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.287
So what do we do now?

01:18.370 --> 01:21.164
Let's prepare a mission proposal
to show CARA.

01:21.248 --> 01:26.170
Oh, I'll put in a request for funding.
That's my favorite part.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.755
We know.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.757
Snoopy, you--

01:32.843 --> 01:34.887
Where did that silly dog go?

01:36.263 --> 01:37.556
I think I know.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.017
He's headed for the launchpad!

01:44.771 --> 01:47.983
Snoopy, you can't just fly off to space.

01:50.444 --> 01:54.072
Even if you are an experienced
NASA-trained astronaut.

01:54.156 --> 01:59.745
Yeah. There are rules and protocols for
this sort of thing. Rules and protocols!

02:02.122 --> 02:03.957
We're losing the signal.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.751
Charlie Brown!

02:05.834 --> 02:11.173
It's highly unorthodox, but if we don't
act now, we might lose our chance.

02:11.256 --> 02:15.427
Wait. Are you saying you want to
help Snoopy blast off to space?

02:15.511 --> 02:19.348
I'm saying I'm swept up in the moment.
To mission control!

03:10.232 --> 03:11.650
I'll be flight director.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.987
Marcie, do you mind resuming
your duties as mission scientist?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.616
I'd call that a yes.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.494
Isn't it exciting, Charlie Brown?

03:22.578 --> 03:26.248
Just think,
our first encounter with alien life.

03:29.543 --> 03:34.006
Greetings from Earth. Please accept
this gift as a token of friendship.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.600
It's bad enough worrying what
everyone thinks of me on this planet,

03:44.683 --> 03:47.060
let alone all the other planets out there.

03:47.144 --> 03:52.399
Why bother going to space to find aliens?
Everyone knows they're right… here!

03:58.322 --> 04:03.327
If an alien was hiding in a broom closet,
a broom would be the perfect disguise.
If an alien was hiding in a broom closet,

04:03.994 --> 04:05.037
I'm on to you.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.583
All right, everyone, let's focus.
Are we ready to launch?

04:09.666 --> 04:10.751
Ready.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.002
Ready.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.170
Ready.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.089
Sir? Sir.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.094
Present.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.597
Charlie Brown, you know Snoopy best,

04:23.680 --> 04:26.600
so you're in charge
of capsule communications.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.227
I guess we're doing this.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.395
Snoopy, do you copy?

04:35.150 --> 04:36.777
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

04:36.860 --> 04:39.154
<i>What is going on here?</i>

04:39.238 --> 04:43.992
<i>You can't just borrow a state-of-the-art
spacecraft for a joyride.</i>

04:46.370 --> 04:50.290
<i>Even if you are experienced
NASA-trained astronauts,</i>

04:50.374 --> 04:53.544
<i>there are rules and protocols!</i>

04:54.336 --> 04:55.838
Sorry, CARA.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.967
We never would have done it
under normal circumstances,

05:00.050 --> 05:03.679
but we think we may have found
a signal from intelligent alien life!

05:04.638 --> 05:07.599
<i>Well, that would be a huge discovery.</i>

05:07.683 --> 05:10.811
Or maybe there's alien life right… here!

05:13.438 --> 05:14.648
Rats.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.490
Listen to this, CARA.

05:28.078 --> 05:33.000
<i>Good guess, but I'm afraid that's
not a signal from an alien civilization.</i>

05:35.752 --> 05:37.921
<i>It's the microwave in the break room.</i>

05:39.089 --> 05:41.425
<i>It always does that
when someone's making popcorn.</i>

05:48.932 --> 05:51.351
No sense in letting
good popcorn go to waste.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.981
So I guess alien life
really is just science fiction.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.442
<i>On the contrary, Charlie Brown,</i>

05:58.525 --> 06:02.821
<i>searching for life outside of Earth
is one of NASA's biggest goals.</i>
<i>searching for life outside of Earth
is one of NASA's biggest goals.</i>

06:03.405 --> 06:06.241
So you are looking for
little green space people?

06:06.325 --> 06:08.660
Or are they already here?

06:11.496 --> 06:12.748
<i>Not exactly.</i>

06:12.831 --> 06:18.212
<i>Our search right now is mostly focused
on looking for microorganisms,</i>

06:18.295 --> 06:23.008
<i>which are forms of life so tiny,
we need a microscope to see them.</i>

06:23.091 --> 06:25.802
<i>We don't know for sure
what we might discover,</i>

06:25.886 --> 06:27.596
<i>but we've already found many clues</i>

06:27.679 --> 06:32.142
<i>to suggest that life could exist
somewhere in the universe,</i>

06:32.226 --> 06:35.521
<i>maybe even in our own solar system.</i>

06:41.276 --> 06:42.986
Needs butter.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.033
I really thought I had something there.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.118
<i>Don't worry, Franklin.</i>

06:50.202 --> 06:52.829
<i>This may not have been
the breakthrough you thought,</i>

06:52.913 --> 06:56.416
<i>but the next discovery
could be right on the horizon.</i>

06:57.251 --> 07:02.714
<i>After all, the search for life
will be the voyage of a lifetime for…</i>
<i>After all, the search for life
will be the voyage of a lifetime for…</i>

07:04.383 --> 07:06.552
<i>these lucky robots!</i>

07:07.970 --> 07:09.471
- Amazing.
- Wow!

07:10.055 --> 07:11.974
Who could compete with that?

07:19.189 --> 07:21.149
<i>Oh, cheer up, Snoopy.</i>

07:21.733 --> 07:25.612
<i>Until we have robust systems
to allow for human exploration,</i>

07:25.696 --> 07:30.409
<i>it's just more practical for the exploring
of other planets to be done by robots.</i>

07:40.419 --> 07:42.171
That's automation for ya.
