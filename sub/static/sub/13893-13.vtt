00:13.596 --> 00:15.146
This is the worst!

00:15.146 --> 00:16.846
I don't know, I kind of like it up here

00:16.846 --> 00:18.546
The world seems different at this height.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.406
It makes me feel like a giant!

00:23.136 --> 00:25.566
What? Look, we're not up here to enjoy the view,

00:25.566 --> 00:27.656
so will you just come and help me clean these gutters?

00:27.656 --> 00:29.876
I'm helping, I'm holding the hose.

00:29.876 --> 00:31.646
Look, I'm taking a giant leak.

00:35.456 --> 00:38.256
Yeah, well, you don't need those gloves to hold the hose.

00:38.256 --> 00:40.466
Look at this dude! Come on, let me wear them!

00:40.466 --> 00:41.266
Sorry man,

00:41.266 --> 00:45.096
you should have thought about that before you threw paper and lost to my scissors.

00:46.256 --> 00:48.236
Whatever dude, just hose this stuff off.

00:51.816 --> 00:53.626
- What the heck?! - Uh, sorry, man.

00:54.186 --> 00:55.826
Weird, it's a tape.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.936
Wonder what it's doing up in the gutter.

00:57.936 --> 00:59.536
Maybe it fell out of a plane.

00:59.696 --> 01:01.776
Nah, it's probably just trash.

01:01.776 --> 01:03.106
I'm gonna see how far I can chuck it.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.046
- Wait! - What?

01:04.046 --> 01:05.816
Don't you wanna see what band it is?

01:05.866 --> 01:06.876
Oh, okay.

01:08.306 --> 01:09.556
Solid Bold?

01:09.696 --> 01:12.156
Augh, it's that single of that summertime song.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.536
Summer Time Loving? Loving in the Summer Time?

01:16.386 --> 01:18.056
- Yeah. - Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

01:18.056 --> 01:20.806
Ah, this is my jam right here!

01:20.806 --> 01:22.846
What? This song sucks.

01:22.846 --> 01:25.336
Nah, you were all into it too, I remember.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.696
Yeah, just for that one summer in junior high

01:27.696 --> 01:29.386
and then I realized how lame it was.

01:29.386 --> 01:30.206
Whatever man,

01:30.216 --> 01:31.686
once we pop this into the stereo,

01:31.696 --> 01:34.586
all the good memories will come flooding back, and you'll see.

01:34.586 --> 01:36.296
You'll see whose jam it is.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.956
I'm not listening to that trash.

01:37.956 --> 01:39.896
You need to get your mind out of these gutters,

01:39.896 --> 01:41.746
and into the summer!

01:41.746 --> 01:44.906

02:59.016 --> 02:59.956
Oh, never heard of them.

02:59.956 --> 03:01.556
Yeah, I know, you wouldn't have.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.606
You gotta be in the know to know, you know.

03:03.636 --> 03:04.206
No.

03:04.256 --> 03:05.936
And that's why you've never heard of them.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.986
But trust me, these guys are like real, real musicians.

03:09.136 --> 03:10.336

Look, all I know is tthat his song is still stuck in my head.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.936
Alright, well, what if we sit down

03:33.936 --> 03:36.466
and listen to the entire summertime song beginning to end.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.796
That way your brain'll have closure and then it can move on!

It's not working. The stupid song's still stuck in my head.

04:23.416 --> 04:25.756
You have a song stuck in your head?

04:28.386 --> 04:30.396

04:33.326 --> 04:35.456
Dude, turn it off, I'm trying to think.

04:36.296 --> 04:38.306
Dude stop playing the tape we've already tried-

04:42.326 --> 04:43.626
What's wrong with you!?

04:43.626 --> 04:44.516
I don't...

04:45.666 --> 04:46.976
...know! I can't...

04:48.096 --> 04:49.496
...control it!

04:50.116 --> 04:51.686
We gotta find Skips.

04:56.226 --> 04:58.596
Yeah, I've seen this before.

04:58.686 --> 04:59.846
Hold still.

05:02.376 --> 05:03.596
What was that for!?

05:03.596 --> 05:06.576
You're not thinking about the song anymore, are you?

05:08.486 --> 05:09.666
It's not funny-

05:11.486 --> 05:13.056
-see and it didn't even work!

05:13.056 --> 05:15.916
Look, seriously, I don't know what's wrong with you.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.306
Just sleep it off,

05:17.316 --> 05:20.076
you'll probably forget about it in the morning!

05:32.646 --> 05:36.116
Hello? Hello?

05:43.216 --> 05:45.286
Get out, get out!

06:02.806 --> 06:04.346
The song. It's gone!

06:04.356 --> 06:06.056
Mordecai! Mordecai!

06:06.106 --> 06:07.396
Huh? What's up?

06:07.396 --> 06:09.186
The song's not in my head anymore!

06:09.186 --> 06:10.226
That's awesome dude.

06:10.226 --> 06:12.426
Now we never have to hear that dumb song again.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.636
What the heck is that?

06:18.416 --> 06:20.686
I have no idea what I'm looking at.

06:20.686 --> 06:22.186
I think the song must've left your head

06:22.186 --> 06:24.376
and manifested itself into a physical form.

06:25.576 --> 06:27.166
Well, does it have an "Off" switch?

06:27.166 --> 06:27.916
I dunno!

06:27.916 --> 06:30.086
Hey, dancing song dude! Knock it off!

06:31.816 --> 06:32.856
Dude, quit it!

06:32.936 --> 06:34.956
Seriously, man! I'm sick of this song!

06:35.786 --> 06:36.576
Get off!

06:37.516 --> 06:39.326
Oh my gosh, it's a ghost tape!

06:40.846 --> 06:42.016
Dude. Calm down.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.336
It's not a ghost. It's just music.

06:44.336 --> 06:47.406
You can't touch music. But music can touch you.

06:47.456 --> 06:49.526
Oh, barf. How do we get rid of it?

06:49.606 --> 06:52.416
I don't know. If we just ignore it, it'll probably just go away.

07:18.976 --> 07:21.646
Dude that's it, we gotta do something about this.

07:21.666 --> 07:23.536
What can we do, he's unstoppable!

07:23.536 --> 07:25.376
We gotta fight fire with fire.

07:25.376 --> 07:27.886
Dude, hello, fire's just gonna go right through him!

07:27.886 --> 07:31.016
No dude, we gotta battle him with our own song!

07:31.026 --> 07:31.616
What?

07:31.616 --> 07:34.986
We're gonna write the cheesiest most repetitive and catchy song ever

07:34.986 --> 07:36.736
and we'll see how he likes it.

07:36.736 --> 07:38.016
Aw, snap!

07:38.016 --> 07:39.496
And that's the perfect title!

07:52.216 --> 07:54.876

07:54.876 --> 07:56.646
I know, we're gonna get rid of it for good.

07:56.646 --> 07:58.146
But we need you to buy us some time,

07:58.146 --> 08:00.316
so just go dance with it and pretend like you're having fun.

08:00.316 --> 08:02.666

08:02.666 --> 08:05.866

08:11.096 --> 08:12.966
Okay, song, song.

08:14.486 --> 08:16.886
Okay, we'll just repeat that. And lyrics, go!

08:16.886 --> 08:17.896
Uh, summertime lovin'!

08:17.896 --> 08:19.726
No dude, c'mon, gimme something I can use.

08:19.726 --> 08:21.046

08:22.176 --> 08:24.226

08:24.226 --> 08:25.226
