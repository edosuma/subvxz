You cost us a lot of money

by taking over his drug operation.

That's probably because Diaz
is controlling the entire city,

02:25.854 --> 02:27.436
including police and cameras.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.765
I just hacked a new thermal sensing
program from the NSA,

02:30.859 --> 02:32.020
so maybe that gets us somewhere.

coming into Star City.

to restock his firepower.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.149
And if she's making
the trip personally

03:59.239 --> 04:01.447

on is big.

to take her out.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.675

are getting bigger.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.767

start lying to you?

Don't tell me that the Quadrant's
money has made you go soft?

to meet up last night.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.706
Well, I guess your men are lying
to you again.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.201

Well, we can wait until
my NSA lead pans out.

around here picking our noses.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.580
No, you're absolutely right. And we
need to go at this some way

11:13.673 --> 11:15.255
that does not depend on finding Diaz.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.832

at straws.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.802
What if we grasp at his wallet?

11:21.639 --> 11:24.256
The best way to get to Diaz
is to go after his operation.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.717
What operation?

11:25.810 --> 11:28.143
He was really deep
into pushing Vertigo.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.390
Was?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.517
John and Oliver took out
his operation three weeks ago.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.017
Well, then that means Diaz has to be
in the market for a new supplier.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.478
Or an old one.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.193
Before Diaz went to prison,
he led the Scorpions.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.899
That is Star City's biggest supplier.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.074
That feels like a leap.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.618
It may be, but it's all we got.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.661
And even if it doesn't lead to Diaz,

11:46.748 --> 11:49.081
we still take down a drug operation.
That's a win-win.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.750
You know, but the problem is,
with me boxed out of the SCPD,

11:51.836 --> 11:53.748
it's gonna be a lot harder
to get intel on the Scorpions.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.374
Maybe not.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.281
What are you talking about?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.234
Mr. Mayor.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.119
I've been meaning
to congratulate you.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.248
I thought I'd come down here
in person.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.415
I mean, you are the mayor of my city.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.466
And we have a lot in common.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.880
What the hell do you want?

12:45.974 --> 12:48.717
Straight to business. I love it.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.727
Here's an executive order

12:51.813 --> 12:54.977
for a certain piece
of municipal real estate

12:55.066 --> 12:56.853
to be sold privately.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.898
Now, the good news, it's a bargain.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.322
Well, I'm not signing this.
I'm not signing anything for you.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.774
I would reconsider your position.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.109
Really?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.444
I bet

13:10.915 --> 13:13.123
she'd give you that same advice.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.994
I'm telling you right now,
if anything happens to her...

13:17.088 --> 13:19.296
Why would I wanna hurt Laurel?

13:20.591 --> 13:21.581
Hmm?

13:22.844 --> 13:24.176
She's with me now.

13:26.764 --> 13:31.555
And she is
such a smart, little thing.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.932
(SIGHS)

13:35.023 --> 13:37.106
She knows how to pick
the winning side.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.855
I hope it runs in the family.

13:42.697 --> 13:43.938
Let's go, baby.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.528
Come on.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.871
Behind that glass door is where
the Scorpions do their business.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.125
- The problem is, it's sound proof.
- But not laser proof.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.960
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Absolutely.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.264
The CIA would kill to get a laser
microphone with this capacity.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.557
How long is this gonna take?

14:12.560 --> 14:17.931
Just trying to find a signal.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.890
All right, well, let's hurry it up.
I didn't get a severance.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.065
I really shouldn't be gambling.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.110
Got something. (CLEARS THROAT)

Huge deal going down tonight.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.858
New buyer.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.070
Is trying to get some product
to tide them over for the short-term.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.450
Could be our friend.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.202
They say when it's going down?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.951
No, no, no. I lost the signal.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.748
The big guy is blocking my laser.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.048
I'm on it.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.546
Yo, man.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.883
Yo, man. You think I didn't see that?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.588
You trying to copy my bets, hoss?

14:51.682 --> 14:53.093
You trying to ruin my odds?

14:53.184 --> 14:55.096
What the hell are you talking about?

14:55.186 --> 14:58.179
(SCOFFS) So we lying now?
That's what we're doing?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.309
- Let me see that paper.
- You're crazy.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.111
Oh, damn.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.905
Uh, you know what, I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.482
Here you go, man. That's yours.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.986
I just get a little crazy
when I lose. Everybody, chill.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.411
I'm leaving.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.282
- You get the location?
- Got it.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.743
Well, let's ruin Diaz's next party.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.254
MR. TERRIFIC: What if we're wrong?

15:28.845 --> 15:31.212
And those crates are filled with
something other than narcotics.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.264
Like lollipops,
or I don't know, puppies.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.559
BLACK CANARY: I counted a dozen
more guys out front, strapped up.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.307
I'm guessing it's not puppies.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.564
before the group outside
notices we're here.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.391
And before Diaz's crew shows.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.619
- MR. TERRIFIC: Definitely not puppies.
- Or drugs.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.080
The product
the Scorpions are moving is M4s.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.790
You guys still think Diaz
is the buyer?

16:07.925 --> 16:09.336
Yeah. Definitely.

The Quadrant.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.588
You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.594
I never could get anyone to confirm
their existence.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.225
Yeah, well, they are real.
Very, very, real.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.933
We're tracking this one. Cassamento.
Hoping she will lead us to Diaz.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.522
Yeah, well, we were hoping the
Scorpions would lead us to Diaz, too.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.725
Got some intel they were planning
a huge thing tonight.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.812
We just figured it was drugs.
Turns out it was an ambush.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.396
Quadrant wanted the Scorpions dead.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.697
They wanted us dead, too.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.820
It's a good thing you guys showed up
when you did.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.651

or something, huh?

conducted yourselves aside,

that I played in it.

Everyone who thinks the Quadrant
showing up

18:22.310 --> 18:24.597
when Diaz gets control of the city
is a coincidence

18:24.687 --> 18:25.723
raise your hands.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.814
The muscle that they brought in
yesterday were Diaz's guys.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.645
The question is, what are they doing
working with the Quadrant?

18:31.736 --> 18:34.103
A.R.G.U.S. think Cassamento is
planning to move a huge shipment

18:34.196 --> 18:36.438
of weapons into the city.
Kasnian weapons.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.236
Military grade. Much worse than
what we saw tonight.

Wasn't expecting to see you here.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.374
Wasn't expecting to see you either.
Everything all right?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.873
Not really.
Diaz just paid me a visit.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.376
He wants me to sign over a piece
of city property to him. A building.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.298
So why are you here instead
of talking to your boy?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.592
Because I couldn't get in touch
with Oliver.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.377
(SIGHS)

18:59.639 --> 19:01.551
The Quadrant. What is that?

19:01.641 --> 19:04.884
Just a super powerful,
monolithic, secret organization.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.184
No big deal.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.511
Diaz was wearing that ring.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.562
So Diaz isn't just working
with Cassamento. He...

19:12.652 --> 19:14.268
He joined the Quadrant.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.776
The attack on the Scorpions
was to take out the competition. His.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.073
And I'm guessing
that that city property

19:20.159 --> 19:22.526
will be a really nice place
to store all that foreign ordnance

19:22.620 --> 19:24.407
that Cassamento is planning on
bringing into the city.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.120

19:28.042 --> 19:29.158
where is it?

from tranquilizer dart.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.331
Time to go see Diaz.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.087
You think he'll give you a reward?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.009
A man can dream.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.092
But I settle for satisfaction.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.090
Enjoy it while it lasts.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.348
Because, Anatoly,
when you are no longer useful,

19:50.523 --> 19:51.855
he'll cut you loose.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.892
Just like Cayden James.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.191
Cayden James made fatal mistake.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.689
Underestimating Diaz.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.816
I do not.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.193
I see him for who he is.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.116
I understand his code.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.580
Diaz doesn't have a code.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.624
He doesn't have honor.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.586
But you working with him,

20:16.507 --> 20:21.969
you are betraying everything
that you've ever believed in.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.181
No need to be gentle with this one.

No, hoss. We're good.

I can't stop thinking about dying.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.329
Hmm.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.508
In the middle of the fight,
I just froze.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.132

21:06.599 --> 21:08.841

about dying as it was about...

Leaving Zoe without a father.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.268
Yeah, you get it.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.057
You got a kid younger than Zoe.
How do you deal with it?

21:17.193 --> 21:19.606
I don't, man. Not out here.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.732

21:22.364 --> 21:24.071
I leave daddy home.

to move guns into the city.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.843
Or Laurel. At least not my Laurel.

She wouldn't choose a guy like

Diaz.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.762
You think he gives anyone a choice?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.226
Do you?

22:36.564 --> 22:38.100
That's why I'm here.

To tell you
that you don't have a choice.

Don't pretend like you give a crap
about me, all right.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.111
You proud of yourself for turning
a father's grief against him?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.993
As far as I'm concerned,
you're worse than Diaz.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.870
You have no idea
what he is capable of.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.078
I know what you're capable of.
You can bring walls smashing down.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.207
You really expect me to believe

23:02.298 --> 23:04.085
that you are scared
of a thug like Diaz?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.962
So much more than just a thug.
And, yes.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.137
Yes, I am scared.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.923
And you should be scared, too.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.764
So just sign the damn paper.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.227
(EXHALES SHARPLY) God damn it!

23:22.318 --> 23:24.150

didn't I?

23:24.403 --> 23:25.985
I let you into my home,
set you up,

I bet you and Diaz,

23:28.032 --> 23:29.989
you must have just loved that.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.404
Hate me all you want.
I'm sure I deserve it.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.864
But I need you to sign this
or he's gonna kill you.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.830
Now that the daughter act is shot,

23:45.382 --> 23:47.419
there's no need for you
to be in my home,

23:48.385 --> 23:49.751
is there?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.713
All right, so when I get home
tonight, please,

23:53.849 --> 23:57.593
I expect you to be gone, all right?
Please just be gone.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.894

- Please get out of here, now!

JOHN: Those Kasnian weapons
Cassamento imported

24:16.997 --> 24:19.455
are shipping out tonight
for the Eastern Seaboard.

But even with A.R.G.U.S. backing
us up there's no way

I'd do whatever he wanted

26:14.239 --> 26:15.946
to keep my Laurel safe.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.415
He killed her.

He's not filled with anger inside

Well, I'm not gonna let him do
anything to you, all right?

Yeah, you're gonna protect me
because you're the mayor.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.724
You're not the mayor of anything.

Okay, listen, I'm gonna protect you

27:26.270 --> 27:29.183

what happened to my Laurel

27:29.273 --> 27:30.605
