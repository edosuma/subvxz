00:51.890 --> 00:54.650
It's the greatest show time!

01:22.760 --> 01:24.050
There's no doubt.

01:24.220 --> 01:26.760
- He's here.
- Who?

01:29.180 --> 01:31.810
Be careful. He's a traitor.

01:31.930 --> 01:34.930
There's someone who keeps
looking at you. See?

01:37.100 --> 01:39.480
It's okay, he's a friend.

01:39.610 --> 01:43.740
Please turn your attention
to this gentleman!

01:43.900 --> 01:48.070
Now, one, two, three!

01:55.460 --> 01:56.920
There he is! Get him!

02:15.060 --> 02:16.600
Grab my hand!

02:21.150 --> 02:22.610
I let him get away again!

02:22.770 --> 02:25.110
Aren't you the one who got away?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.040
One more time!

02:40.500 --> 02:42.000
Take that!

03:22.580 --> 03:25.460
But what about the rest of it?

03:43.770 --> 03:47.530
You were in my dream.

03:49.610 --> 03:52.240
Everyone is startled at first.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.030
The DC Mini.

03:56.160 --> 04:00.250
It's the scientific key that allows us
to open the door to our dreams.

04:02.870 --> 04:04.750
It can even do all this?

04:06.090 --> 04:08.300
It really is a dream machine.

04:08.420 --> 04:12.260
To tell you the truth,
the DC Mini is still incomplete.

04:12.430 --> 04:17.760
Once complete, we'll be able to enter
your dream even while awake.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.480
You said he was a friend.

04:22.270 --> 04:26.110
We used to work together.

04:26.690 --> 04:30.030
Why did he put you in a cage?

04:30.190 --> 04:31.860
I don't know.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.450
He's not the kind of person
who would trick me.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.750
Why are they all me?

04:41.870 --> 04:44.500
That was really disturbing.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.920
This is Tarzan, right?

04:47.090 --> 04:49.920
This is a scene from
a spy movie, perhaps?

04:50.510 --> 04:53.760
The fighting was rather fun.

04:54.550 --> 04:57.470
REM sleep that occurs later during the sleep cycle...

04:57.640 --> 05:00.310
...is longer and easier to analyze.

05:00.470 --> 05:03.890
If earlier cycles are, say,
artsy film shorts...

05:04.060 --> 05:08.150
...later cycles are like feature-length
blockbuster movies.

05:08.310 --> 05:14.900
Then that makes you
a dream movie star.

05:15.030 --> 05:17.870
Do you not like movies?

05:18.030 --> 05:20.030
It's not that.

05:22.370 --> 05:23.750
What is this?

05:23.910 --> 05:26.710
The victim in the homicide case
I'm working on right now.

05:27.880 --> 05:33.970
I haven't been able to catch the perp,
so maybe that's why I...

05:34.130 --> 05:37.430
- Your anxiety neurosis.
- Do you think this is the source?

05:38.010 --> 05:39.680
No need to rush.

05:39.850 --> 05:42.600
The treatment's just getting started.

05:45.440 --> 05:49.230
Take care, Captain Konakawa.

05:56.110 --> 05:58.530
When can I see you again?

08:12.920 --> 08:16.040
I'm in a bind.

08:17.170 --> 08:20.130
- I can see that.
- No, it's not that.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.510
I was on my way to see you.

08:26.470 --> 08:30.140
It's not that! The DC Mini!

08:32.230 --> 08:35.559
It was stolen? The DC Mini?

08:35.980 --> 08:38.190
We found out this morning.

08:38.360 --> 08:42.070
Three samples in Dr. Tokita's
possession were stolen.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.860
But why?

08:45.370 --> 08:48.790
We'll worry about the reason later.
We need to find them now.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.540
Do you think it's internal?

08:54.170 --> 08:55.880
Unfortunately.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.750
We'll talk about that later.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.170
Foundation for
Psychiatric Research

09:01.210 --> 09:03.880
Meet me in my office.
We'll figure out a plan...

09:04.880 --> 09:07.260
...before the chairman finds out.

09:07.390 --> 09:11.140
Yes, we have to protect
the DC Mini.

09:16.060 --> 09:20.730
It's too bad it was stolen, but all
we have to do is make another one.

09:20.900 --> 09:24.610
You should know better than anyone
what can happen if it's misused.

09:24.740 --> 09:26.990
You invented it.

09:27.740 --> 09:31.740
I make it, but how it's used
is your job, At-chan.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.500
Don't call me At-chan.

09:42.670 --> 09:45.260
There is one more problem.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.090
Good grief.

09:47.390 --> 09:51.890
I hadn't programmed the access
controls into the DC Mini yet.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.020
Translate that for me.

09:55.190 --> 09:58.150
It means that the person
who stole the DC Mini...

09:58.310 --> 10:03.320
...can connect to a psychotherapy
machine at any time, from any place...

10:03.490 --> 10:07.110
...and use it to intrude into the minds
connected to that machine.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.950
Chief's Office

10:09.120 --> 10:12.740
I see. We have to hurry.

10:22.130 --> 10:26.550
It is man's responsibility
to control science and technology.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.180
Chairman.

10:29.430 --> 10:31.930
Sharing in another's dream.

10:32.060 --> 10:34.270
It is quite literally
a technological dream...

10:34.430 --> 10:39.690
...but, in time,
it can lead to violence.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.440
It was an invention that never should have been created.

10:44.190 --> 10:46.820
This discussion again?

10:48.030 --> 10:50.450
The DC Mini represents the hope...

10:50.620 --> 10:53.580
...that shines on the new horizons
of psychiatric treatment.

10:54.830 --> 10:57.460
It is taking control over dreams.

10:57.580 --> 11:00.040
Your overconfidence
will bring weakness.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.290
It is not about control.

11:02.460 --> 11:06.590
We are simply pursuing
a deeper connection with our patients.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.970
The terrorist who stole it
won't see it that way.

11:14.010 --> 11:17.230
But it hasn't even been misused yet.

11:18.730 --> 11:22.900
Thieves are not always wrong.

11:23.820 --> 11:25.320
Paprika.

11:26.190 --> 11:28.700
I hear there's a woman...

11:28.860 --> 11:32.570
...who's been using the psychotherapy
machine for unapproved treatments.

11:33.030 --> 11:37.830
Are you going to believe
such groundless rumors, chairman?

11:38.040 --> 11:41.920
Discipline calls for a search of the
DC Mini rather than Paprika's bikini.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.590
This is true happiness.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.590
Discipline?

11:46.750 --> 11:52.010
Even the five court ladies danced
in sync to the frog's flutes and drums.

11:52.180 --> 11:56.100
The whirlwind of recycled paper
was a sight to see.

11:56.260 --> 11:58.560
It was like computer graphics!

11:59.980 --> 12:04.310
That I don't support Technicolor
parfaits and snobby petit bourgeois...

12:04.480 --> 12:08.860
...is common knowledge in Oceania!

12:09.030 --> 12:12.110
Now is the time to return home
to the blue sky!

12:12.860 --> 12:15.700
The confetti will dance around
the shrine gates.

12:15.870 --> 12:21.040
The mailbox and the refrigerator
will lead the way!

12:21.870 --> 12:25.880
Anyone who cares
about expiration dates...

12:26.040 --> 12:28.880
...will not get in the way
of the glory train!

12:29.630 --> 12:33.590
They need to fully realize
the liver of the triangle rulers!

12:34.470 --> 12:38.930
Now, this festival was decided
by the third-grade class...

12:39.100 --> 12:40.770
...with the telephoto camera!

12:40.930 --> 12:43.270
Move forward! Come together!
I am the ultimate...

12:43.770 --> 12:45.730
...governor!

12:46.730 --> 12:47.770
Chief!

12:51.150 --> 12:53.400
Now! Right now!

12:54.490 --> 12:57.130
Take me in!

13:32.650 --> 13:35.070
He has the dream of a patient
planted in his brain.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.120
How's the chief doing?

13:39.870 --> 13:42.620
His breathing and pulse are stable.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.880
I guess it could've been worse.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.300
Dr. Chiba, here are
the chief's medical records.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.670
Thank you.

13:54.420 --> 13:57.760
He was probably using the
therapy machine to treat a patient-

13:57.890 --> 13:59.800
When someone used
a DC Mini to intrude.

14:00.930 --> 14:03.640
And the dream was projected
into his subconscious...

14:03.810 --> 14:05.980
...without him knowing.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.900
But for that to happen...

14:08.480 --> 14:11.650
The culprit has to be watching
this nightmare too.

14:13.110 --> 14:14.780
What a desperate terrorist.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.160
All terrorists are desperate.

14:17.320 --> 14:22.740
The sun during midday
will light up the dark night.

14:22.950 --> 14:28.750
Night dreams of day.
Light dreams of darkness.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.710
But the ignorant sun...

14:31.880 --> 14:34.460
...will chase away the darkness
and burn the shadows...

14:34.590 --> 14:37.970
...eventually burning itself!

14:38.220 --> 14:39.470
Himuro!

14:41.510 --> 14:44.470
The shade of the tree
with the flowers that bloom at night...

14:44.640 --> 14:46.940
...is where the residents
of darkness rest.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.480
Why is Himuro in there?

14:49.020 --> 14:52.770
The people of daytime
are not allowed!

14:56.740 --> 14:58.110
Where is Himuro?

14:59.320 --> 15:03.280
He's been out for the past few days,
but I didn't think too much of it.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.500
Himuro tends to abandon
everything else...

15:07.660 --> 15:09.790
...when he really gets
into something.

15:10.630 --> 15:13.380
Like doctor, like assistant.

15:13.550 --> 15:17.300
How could we not have seen this coming?

15:20.550 --> 15:23.140
I thought he was my friend.

15:23.850 --> 15:29.310
A genius produces a lot more
than he realizes.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.980
More clearly, please.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.400
Himuro was jealous of Dr. Tokita.

15:35.570 --> 15:39.490
Even I feel bitter towards you
sometimes, Dr. Chiba.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.990
No matter how hard I try,
I'm not as good as you.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.160
I feel powerless.

16:02.230 --> 16:03.510
It's open.

16:04.050 --> 16:07.310
- You mean you opened it.
- This is illegal, you know.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.680
I'm not as bad as Himuro, though.

16:20.030 --> 16:22.610
- Welcome home.
- Welcome back.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.800
He can't be serious.

16:58.940 --> 17:02.450
- This is dangerous.
- This isn't your cue.

18:35.340 --> 18:36.990
Anaphylaxis?

18:37.790 --> 18:40.290
Like an allergy?

18:41.840 --> 18:44.510
I can't think of any other reason.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.760
I got stung by a jellyfish
when I was a kid...

18:48.930 --> 18:51.850
...and even now, I have
allergic reactions at the sight of one.

18:52.010 --> 18:56.310
It didn't occur to me until now.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.480
Here you go.
Who had the udon set?

19:01.230 --> 19:04.610
But the DC Mini uses
a transmission formula...

19:04.730 --> 19:09.030
...within the natural width
of the body's energy level.

19:09.660 --> 19:11.450
Who had the jumbo steak set?

19:12.240 --> 19:16.960
Depending on the frequency of use,
the body might adapt to it.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.080
And as a result, Dr. Chiba,
who has had the most exposure...

19:21.250 --> 19:23.090
...was more susceptible
to invasion...

19:24.050 --> 19:28.550
...even when she wasn't connected
to the DC Mini, nor was she asleep.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.390
Who had the paella?

19:34.260 --> 19:38.060
I think you have a problem too.
Like overeating.

19:40.190 --> 19:42.060
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

19:42.860 --> 19:44.070
Fight?

19:44.520 --> 19:49.070
Implanting dreams into
other people's heads is terrorism.

19:53.620 --> 19:57.500
At-chan, you said
that Himuro and I were alike.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.250
I think so too. All the more reason
this is unforgivable.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.550
Hello?

20:14.430 --> 20:15.810
We'll be there immediately.

20:30.570 --> 20:32.320
Chief! Please, come back!

20:33.160 --> 20:36.330
Wake up! Chief!

20:37.290 --> 20:39.910
The delicious left brain
is getting older...

20:40.080 --> 20:42.920
...and drifting to a faraway island.

20:47.460 --> 20:50.090
Himuro, give him back!

20:50.260 --> 20:55.390
I, who stand before you,
am the protector of your dreams.

20:56.970 --> 21:01.810
I wonder what kind of punishment
will befall the ignorant commoner...

21:01.980 --> 21:05.270
...who tries to enter
this sacred dream?

21:12.650 --> 21:17.160
You're the feisty country girl
I saved some time ago.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.120
How are you?

21:21.120 --> 21:25.250
If he was not home
when I passed by around 7:30...

21:25.420 --> 21:28.630
...then he probably disappeared
into the instant noodle soup.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.960
Thank you for saving me.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.090
I have come to show you
my appreciation.

21:35.010 --> 21:36.430
Is it a square?

21:37.600 --> 21:38.970
No.

21:41.310 --> 21:44.730
It's round, like this.

21:48.310 --> 21:50.480
I can feel it.

21:52.650 --> 21:55.410
- Paprika.
- Do you remember me now?

21:55.530 --> 21:57.910
I'm going to be a little rough.

21:58.780 --> 22:01.580
Paprika, what are you doing?

22:03.910 --> 22:06.420
Now, now, stop that.

22:20.430 --> 22:22.720
Welcome back, Chief.

22:24.140 --> 22:28.610
I wonder where
that parade was going?

22:29.560 --> 22:33.110
A place of no return, most likely.

22:34.940 --> 22:39.700
I felt like I was really close...

22:39.870 --> 22:41.620
...to controlling the entire world.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.830
That was a dream
of a severely delusional patient.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.960
While you were in there, your
brain waves and body deteriorated...

22:51.130 --> 22:52.750
...almost to the point of death.

22:53.380 --> 22:57.510
That's why Paprika came.
Thank you.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.800
You haven't changed...

22:58.930 --> 23:03.310
...since the time you treated
my depression two years ago.

23:04.060 --> 23:06.560
I'll let Paprika know.

23:09.850 --> 23:14.980
But to think that that honest Himuro
was responsible.

23:15.110 --> 23:18.570
What should I do now, Dr. Chiba?

23:19.070 --> 23:22.530
- Please don't do anything.
- What?

23:23.910 --> 23:27.620
The chairman will probably halt
the development of the DC Mini...

23:27.750 --> 23:31.290
...as a result of this incident.

23:32.090 --> 23:35.590
But with you, a board member,
in the hospital...

23:36.420 --> 23:39.010
They can't have a meeting.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.930
Hello? Oh, Konokawa.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.480
How was the...? You know.

23:50.600 --> 23:55.980
I would have asked sooner if I had
known that it would be this good.

23:56.190 --> 23:58.070
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.450
I want to keep it a secret
all to myself.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.700
Paprika's existence
cannot become public...

24:04.870 --> 24:07.540
...until the psychotherapy machines
gain public approval.

24:07.700 --> 24:12.790
She really is
a woman of your dreams.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.800
Women of dreams
are busy these days.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.340
You look tired.
Want me to look in on your dreams?

24:21.840 --> 24:26.310
I haven't been seeing
any of my own lately.

24:58.130 --> 25:01.170
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

25:12.060 --> 25:13.520
Good evening.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.150
What is this place?

25:21.490 --> 25:26.490
A counseling room. A meeting place.
A date spot.

25:27.410 --> 25:30.830
Don't you think dreams
and the Internet are similar?

25:30.950 --> 25:34.000
They are both areas where
the repressed conscious mind vents.

25:34.670 --> 25:36.670
Here you go.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.260
Have you found anything?

25:51.270 --> 25:53.060
In regards to my dreams?

25:53.850 --> 25:55.020
You're so impatient.

25:59.070 --> 26:02.490
Do you work
at the research foundation?

26:02.650 --> 26:04.990
It was Shima who introduced me, after all.

26:05.110 --> 26:06.610
Where do you know
Mr. Shima from?

26:07.450 --> 26:10.120
He's a friend from college.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.620
We got along pretty well,
so we always hung out.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.880
Drinking and watching movies?

26:17.750 --> 26:21.800
No, movies don't interest me.

26:22.130 --> 26:23.840
I love them!

26:26.550 --> 26:27.890
Paprika?

26:29.970 --> 26:31.260
Put it on my tab.

26:31.430 --> 26:33.220
Hey, Paprika!

26:49.990 --> 26:51.620
Which one do you want to see?

26:53.240 --> 26:56.370
I'm sorry,
but movies really aren't my thing.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.710
Come on, hurry!

27:00.920 --> 27:02.250
I don't like movies!

27:09.800 --> 27:11.970
Hey, Tsumura, stop-

27:12.140 --> 27:13.470
Breaking news!

27:13.640 --> 27:17.270
The widow who tells fortunes
in the shade of roof tiles!

27:17.440 --> 27:18.690
The response is sunny!

27:18.900 --> 27:20.270
The sign of good fortune!

27:20.440 --> 27:23.440
The ceiling fan brings a message
releasing epithets!

27:23.610 --> 27:26.030
The maiden who sleeps under
the veranda has a pulse!

27:26.150 --> 27:27.280
This is the way out!

27:27.450 --> 27:30.450
The secret of this view is deep
within the 10-year loan payment!

27:36.080 --> 27:38.040
They are new victims.

27:40.170 --> 27:42.170
I am stopping development.

27:42.340 --> 27:43.840
But the board meeting-

27:44.000 --> 27:46.800
The culprit won't wait
for a board meeting to happen.

27:46.970 --> 27:52.800
I am forbidding all use of DC Mini
and the psychotherapy machines.

27:54.470 --> 27:56.470
This is retribution.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.900
Science is nothing...

28:01.060 --> 28:06.230
...but a piece of trash
before a profound dream.

28:17.290 --> 28:19.000
Are you okay?

28:19.620 --> 28:22.330
I heard the parts are non-recyclable.

28:23.670 --> 28:26.250
But that's an important piece
of equipment.

28:29.550 --> 28:31.260
I'll just have to make it again.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.260
He's a genius.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.350
He's a mysterious one, all right.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.150
You're giving him too much credit.

28:43.270 --> 28:45.480
He's just a kid inside.

28:53.110 --> 28:54.870
DREAMLAND

28:55.030 --> 28:58.830
It was a small theme park,
but I liked it as a kid.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.250
I used to talk about it with Himuro.

29:26.690 --> 29:30.030
Do you really think Himuro is here?

29:30.150 --> 29:32.070
If I knew, I wouldn't be searching.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.780
You're so cold, At-chan.

29:36.740 --> 29:39.080
You should act more like Paprika.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.410
I know, I know.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.670
I have a feeling he's near.

29:44.790 --> 29:46.500
Keep quiet, both of you.

30:17.370 --> 30:18.830
Watch out!

30:32.880 --> 30:34.550
Himuro?

30:36.800 --> 30:39.640
- That's-
- A DC Mini.

30:57.530 --> 31:01.530
The high pressure holds the grab bag
and looks a lot like milk.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.620
The dense forest turns into
a shopping district.

31:03.830 --> 31:06.000
The 24-bit eggplant will be analyzed.

31:06.120 --> 31:09.750
So you're saying both of them were
attacked by way of the DC Mini...

31:09.880 --> 31:12.800
...which broke their psyches.

31:13.380 --> 31:17.840
And the culprit, Kei Himuro, was
also disturbed by the nightmare...

31:18.010 --> 31:21.220
...and tried to commit suicide.
Is that right?

31:22.510 --> 31:25.390
It's not because of the DC Mini!

31:25.520 --> 31:30.980
It's just a little incomplete.
Himuro knew that.

31:31.440 --> 31:35.900
I'm not refuting your invention.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.830
She's the head of
the DC Mini development team.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.080
I'm Chiba.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.960
This is Mr. Konakawa
from the police department.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.090
Yes?

32:02.220 --> 32:04.100
Isn't it wonderful?

32:04.720 --> 32:08.560
The ability to see a friend's dream
as if it were your own.

32:08.730 --> 32:11.020
To share the same dream.

32:13.520 --> 32:17.030
Yes, it probably would be
a wonderful experience.

32:17.190 --> 32:19.150
You understand, right?

32:19.280 --> 32:23.410
It came to me during
a brain scan I was doing...

32:23.580 --> 32:26.790
...using a computer image processor.

32:27.410 --> 32:31.790
And you can use it to treat illness.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.090
That's exactly right!

32:34.250 --> 32:38.550
The nonlinear waves created by
surges in the bioelectrical current...

32:38.670 --> 32:42.430
...can be applied to create
new synapse connections...

32:42.590 --> 32:45.470
...by adjusting the BTU output.

32:46.560 --> 32:52.900
To use a person's body for energy
is a remarkable idea.

32:53.020 --> 32:55.270
Exactly! And the reason
why I focused...

32:55.440 --> 32:59.150
You are talking
with Dr. Tokita, right?

33:03.240 --> 33:04.910
That's her, isn't it?

33:05.740 --> 33:07.620
Paprika.

33:10.540 --> 33:15.590
So what do you think
about this case?

33:15.710 --> 33:18.670
Well, I think it's an accident.

33:19.380 --> 33:22.930
It's hard to build a case
against a dream.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.930
"Isn't it wonderful," eh?

33:28.680 --> 33:30.430
The bulky one.

33:31.810 --> 33:35.730
To think such a silly thought
would lead to such an invention.

33:35.900 --> 33:39.190
He's a kid trapped inside
the body of a genius.

33:39.360 --> 33:45.120
It's an adult's responsibility to steer
that genius in the right direction.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.910
Chairman.

33:47.910 --> 33:52.540
There is always conceit
and negligence behind misconduct.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.590
You have it hard too, I guess.

33:59.960 --> 34:00.000
Good grief.

34:01.010 --> 34:05.890
Where did I go wrong
to end up here?

34:06.340 --> 34:08.719
I want to go back
to our college days...

34:08.889 --> 34:12.929
...back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

34:22.610 --> 34:24.989
I want to go back
to our college days...

34:25.159 --> 34:29.199
...back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

34:57.980 --> 35:00.520
But what about the rest of it?

35:04.490 --> 35:05.650
It's too dangerous!

35:05.820 --> 35:09.370
Himuro went in
and he's not coming back.

35:09.570 --> 35:13.040
If the same happens to you...

35:14.500 --> 35:17.500
There are still two DC Minis
out there.

35:17.620 --> 35:23.550
Our only lead is inside Himuro.
And besides...

35:23.760 --> 35:28.800
The chairman has already prohibited
the use of the therapy machines.

35:29.590 --> 35:32.930
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

35:33.060 --> 35:36.770
Don't worry.
The genius boy is here for backup.

35:36.940 --> 35:40.100
Dr. Tokita again?

35:42.650 --> 35:46.360
I know that you two
established this field...

35:46.820 --> 35:51.370
...so that's all the more reason for you
to place your trust in him...

35:51.490 --> 35:55.620
...but his immaturity is the cause
of all these mishaps!

35:56.790 --> 35:59.540
That's why we'll make him
take responsibility.

35:59.710 --> 36:02.380
Besides, is there anyone else?

36:19.190 --> 36:21.980
This isn't the time for that.

36:22.150 --> 36:25.650
There are people in the world
that understand.

36:26.570 --> 36:30.660
That cop.
He has a mind for science.

36:30.820 --> 36:32.870
He doesn't seem
very smart, though.

36:33.530 --> 36:38.040
Now all I have to do is set the filtering
program for external access and-

36:41.250 --> 36:43.040
What was that for?

36:47.800 --> 36:50.680
Do you really think it was Himuro?

36:52.840 --> 36:59.180
He's your assistant, and he knew
the risks involved with the DC Mini.

36:59.640 --> 37:03.020
He knew what would happen
if he exposed himself for too long.

37:03.150 --> 37:05.190
What did he have to gain from it all?

37:05.360 --> 37:08.740
He was jealous of me.
Even Osanai says so.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.780
He might be a victim too.

37:16.830 --> 37:19.830
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

37:20.540 --> 37:23.710
If so, then it's still dangerous.
We need to confirm-

37:23.830 --> 37:25.500
No more talk.

37:25.670 --> 37:29.050
What I need to do is finish this.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.890
You guys are really alike.

37:38.060 --> 37:39.470
At-chan?

37:39.600 --> 37:41.430
You and Himuro.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.600
You get preoccupied
with what you want to do...

37:43.770 --> 37:45.900
...and ignore what you have to do.

37:46.060 --> 37:50.490
Don't you understand
that your irresponsibility cost lives?

37:50.610 --> 37:55.030
Of course not.
Nothing can get through all that fat.

37:55.160 --> 37:58.740
And now what? "Isn't it wonderful"?
"A mind for science"?

37:58.910 --> 38:00.290
Don't make me laugh.

38:00.450 --> 38:04.080
How can a mad scientist
know what a human mind is?

38:04.210 --> 38:08.210
If you want to be king of geeks
with your bloated ego...

38:08.340 --> 38:12.760
...then just keep up all this and
indulge in your freakish masturbation!

38:40.790 --> 38:43.160
And where is Mr. Konakawa now?

38:43.330 --> 38:46.460
At a hotel. It's all here.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.130
I'm counting on you.

39:06.020 --> 39:08.730
There's no doubt. He's here.

39:09.150 --> 39:11.020
You've crossed the line of action.

39:13.530 --> 39:16.110
Be careful. He's a traitor.

39:16.240 --> 39:20.030
You need to narrow the exposure.
This is Panfocus.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.170
Now, one, two, three!

39:31.750 --> 39:33.340
There he is! Get him!

39:45.310 --> 39:47.010
Welcome.

39:48.770 --> 39:50.690
What floor?

39:53.400 --> 39:56.190
The guy, I'm after him.

39:56.570 --> 40:00.030
Of course. The 14th floor.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.370
Fourteenth floor,
the adventure section.

40:12.380 --> 40:16.590
Fifteenth floor,
the suspense section.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.390
Sixteenth floor,
the romance section.

40:23.510 --> 40:24.890
One more time!

40:27.480 --> 40:29.690
Seventeenth floor,
the special section.

40:29.850 --> 40:31.140
No!

40:33.480 --> 40:34.900
I don't need to go there.

41:09.270 --> 41:11.190
Encore!

41:50.640 --> 41:54.650
I killed myself?

42:00.740 --> 42:03.240
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

42:10.370 --> 42:14.040
It was a rush job,
but I put an access function on it.

42:16.380 --> 42:18.340
Morals, responsibilities...

42:18.500 --> 42:21.090
I don't really get that adults' stuff.

42:21.880 --> 42:24.720
But let's talk it over again.

42:25.930 --> 42:29.720
We're friends, right?

42:46.570 --> 42:48.370
Oh, jeez.

42:48.700 --> 42:53.290
Was making them not enough?
You had to become a doll yourself?

42:55.370 --> 42:57.380
Why did you steal it?

42:58.460 --> 43:02.380
Do you hate me that much?

43:03.550 --> 43:07.300
Or was it not you who did it?

43:07.470 --> 43:09.640
Even with an access function...

43:09.800 --> 43:11.810
...it's not one person's
dream anymore.

43:11.930 --> 43:14.980
That's right!
The DC Mini was both our dreams!

43:15.190 --> 43:19.440
The crossing of two dreams
creates many more dreams.

43:20.060 --> 43:24.110
That's right! The entire development
team dreamt of its completion.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.200
This is a foolish place to be...

43:26.400 --> 43:28.820
...to inquire about
the master of this dream.

43:29.030 --> 43:33.240
The conceit of the daytime residents
is what the nighttime residents want.

43:33.870 --> 43:39.290
To come in carelessly
is like a moth to a flame.

43:40.790 --> 43:43.130
You're not Himuro, are you?

43:46.840 --> 43:51.220
What's the line of action
that clown was talking about?

43:51.810 --> 43:53.970
It's an imaginary line...

43:54.140 --> 43:57.600
...that connects the subjects
on camera.

43:58.310 --> 44:01.520
If the camera crosses that line...

44:01.690 --> 44:04.280
...the cut is awkward.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.280
That's why it has to be like this.

44:07.450 --> 44:09.700
I see. How about Panfocus?

44:10.870 --> 44:13.450
It's a camera technique...

44:13.700 --> 44:18.250
...where you narrow the angle
to get the entire screen in focus.

44:18.750 --> 44:21.840
So you did like them.

44:22.290 --> 44:22.840
Movies.

44:23.290 --> 44:27.300
Are your dreams
in Panfocus now too?

44:27.420 --> 44:30.680
Have you solved the mystery
of why you killed yourself?

44:32.970 --> 44:37.430
I've never thought of suicide.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.100
Maybe it's someone a lot like you.

44:41.230 --> 44:43.020
Like me?

44:43.230 --> 44:45.570
Or another you.

44:49.700 --> 44:52.120
Another me?

45:01.880 --> 45:06.710
Paprika, is the inside of my head
this messed up?

45:07.300 --> 45:10.050
The dreams are merging.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.430
Tokita.

45:13.600 --> 45:16.510
He got started without me!

45:16.720 --> 45:19.390
- Wait! Tokita!
- Paprika!

45:20.730 --> 45:22.980
Why are you here?

45:23.150 --> 45:27.570
The ecstasy that blooms in synapse
is Paprika-brand milk fat!

45:27.730 --> 45:29.400
Five percent is the norm.

45:33.070 --> 45:36.240
Tokita! No!

45:36.410 --> 45:38.580
The safety net of the ocean...

45:38.750 --> 45:41.210
...is nonlinear,
even with what crabs dream of!

45:41.790 --> 45:42.460
Let's go!

45:50.630 --> 45:50.670
Wake up!

45:59.770 --> 46:01.100
So you're saying...

46:01.310 --> 46:06.650
...the dreams of Tokita and Himuro
merged into Konakawa's dream?

46:07.480 --> 46:11.400
The anaphylaxis of the DC Mini
is expanding exponentially!

46:12.200 --> 46:13.990
Just meet me at the lab.

46:24.540 --> 46:26.540
They're not dreaming?

46:27.250 --> 46:29.250
But they're in REM sleep.

46:30.210 --> 46:35.800
It's as if their consciousness
itself has been taken away.

46:42.850 --> 46:45.310
I guess this calls for Paprika.

46:46.690 --> 46:52.610
I'll dive into Himuro's dream.
That's the only way to save Tokita.

47:12.090 --> 47:13.590
Chief, can you hear me?

47:14.420 --> 47:18.140
Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.435
Any abnormalities?

47:20.470 --> 47:23.040
This dream is very dangerous.

47:23.930 --> 47:27.350
If anything happens to Atsuko,
use the awakening apparatus.

47:27.385 --> 47:30.690
Of course. But is it really safe?

47:30.860 --> 47:33.780
Tokita is gone because
he went into Himuro's dream.

47:35.640 --> 47:36.880
Who do you think I am?

47:37.780 --> 47:45.580
- I'm sorry to have doubted you.
- There they are!

48:00.850 --> 48:03.310
Himuro isn't there.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.680
But it's his dream.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.940
Osanai?

49:45.990 --> 49:48.580
- Be careful.
- Leave it to me.

50:59.690 --> 51:01.540
Himuro.

51:34.680 --> 51:36.690
Wake her up!

51:39.610 --> 51:40.770
Chief! Hurry!

52:03.420 --> 52:07.380
That's not
Himuro's dream anymore.

52:07.590 --> 52:10.350
So he was a victim too.

52:11.300 --> 52:15.060
He's an empty shell.

52:15.230 --> 52:18.520
He was invaded
by a collective dream.

52:19.060 --> 52:21.520
A collective dream?

52:21.690 --> 52:24.360
With no access restrictions...

52:24.530 --> 52:28.030
...the DC Mini can be used to invade
any psychotherapy machine.

52:29.990 --> 52:33.200
Every dream it came in contact with
was eaten up...

52:33.370 --> 52:36.910
...into one huge delusion.

52:37.660 --> 52:41.250
And that delusion belongs to...

52:49.880 --> 52:55.600
This breath seethes
in the joy of life.

52:56.350 --> 53:00.100
I will not allow
arrogant scientific technology...

53:00.270 --> 53:04.900
...to intrude in this holy ground.

53:06.150 --> 53:08.950
Return Dr. Tokita to us.

53:10.530 --> 53:13.660
The dreams are horrified...

53:14.240 --> 53:19.660
...that their safe refuge is
destroyed by technology.

53:21.750 --> 53:24.670
Are you going to punish him
like you did Himuro?

53:25.710 --> 53:29.510
In a world of inhumane reality...

53:29.670 --> 53:34.300
...it is the only
humane sanctuary left.

53:34.510 --> 53:36.310
That is a dream.

53:36.510 --> 53:38.980
That parade is full of refugees...

53:39.140 --> 53:42.310
...who were unwillingly
chased out of reality.

53:42.480 --> 53:45.480
You are collecting those
with stolen technology.

53:45.650 --> 53:47.980
Do you plan to take over
the world of dreams?

53:48.940 --> 53:51.150
I am protecting them.

53:51.360 --> 53:54.200
I am the guardian of dreams.

53:55.450 --> 54:00.120
My duty is to mete out justice
to terrorists like you, Paprika.

54:03.630 --> 54:07.840
Don't make me get rough with you.

54:10.170 --> 54:12.340
This is a dream too, huh?

54:12.590 --> 54:15.890
Paprika, wake up! Paprika!

54:21.850 --> 54:23.100
Wake up, Chiba!

54:24.440 --> 54:26.150
Chiba! Paprika!

54:49.420 --> 54:51.710
The sphinx look doesn't suit you.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.470
An intelligent researcher by day...

54:56.640 --> 55:00.220
...the chairman's humble servant
by night, is that it?

55:00.350 --> 55:03.520
Shut up! I have many faces.
That makes me human!

55:04.350 --> 55:09.070
Oedipus is the perfect look for a man
completely controlled by the chairman!

55:09.230 --> 55:11.190
Shut up!

55:24.040 --> 55:27.420
That's right, keep running.

55:27.580 --> 55:29.380
There are no boundaries to dreams.

55:29.540 --> 55:32.510
The spirit will be freed
from the constraints of the body...

55:32.760 --> 55:34.760
...and gain limitless freedom.

55:35.180 --> 55:35.930
Including me!

55:38.140 --> 55:41.850
I will also be free!

55:53.360 --> 55:55.740
The dream continues from here.

56:08.420 --> 56:10.420
No! Paprika!

56:11.540 --> 56:12.210
It's a trap!

56:22.640 --> 56:49.750
Chief! Wake her up! Hurry!

57:00.930 --> 57:03.300
What a lovely sight.

57:04.470 --> 57:08.560
Osanai! What's this? Let me go!

57:08.690 --> 57:10.980
But I finally caught you.

57:11.150 --> 57:14.070
Where is Tokita?

57:14.570 --> 57:17.400
I have no interest in such ugly things.

57:19.070 --> 57:24.080
Of course, because you're not.
You were Himuro's idol after all.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.490
Shut up! Just shut up!

57:25.660 --> 57:28.250
You sold your body
for the DC Mini, didn't you?

57:29.160 --> 57:30.540
Don't remind me!

57:30.710 --> 57:32.630
- You coward!
- Stop it!

57:35.380 --> 57:39.510
This is my sanctuary,
and you'll do as I say.

57:42.010 --> 57:46.560
- I'm a special person.
- Yes, hand-chosen by the chairman.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.310
Osanai, you used to be
smarter than that.

57:49.480 --> 57:53.020
You don't know its true power!

57:55.190 --> 57:58.690
The DC Mini was,
in a way, complete.

57:58.860 --> 58:01.200
No, better than complete.

58:01.860 --> 58:04.620
We can now go back and forth
between dreams and reality...

58:04.740 --> 58:07.950
...even without the DC Mini,
while awake.

58:08.410 --> 58:11.290
You were the one who set up Atsuko
at Himura's place.

58:12.750 --> 58:17.630
It was just a friendly warning
to a terrorist threatening dreams.

58:18.550 --> 58:21.630
You're just like an old baldy I know.

58:22.220 --> 58:27.220
We are the chosen ones assigned
to protect the sanctuary...

58:27.390 --> 58:32.390
...threatened by technology
that has lost its philosophy.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.190
You're just twisted.

58:34.350 --> 58:36.110
You should understand.

58:36.230 --> 58:39.030
Dreams are so sacred
they cannot be controlled-

58:39.150 --> 58:43.910
What would you know? You're just
a little man controlled by jealousy.

58:45.120 --> 58:48.830
You really think
you can beat Tokita?

58:53.500 --> 58:58.000
I warned you,
don't make me get rough.

59:09.810 --> 59:12.060
You should call it a night.

59:12.230 --> 59:15.060
Don't worry, I'm drunk.

59:15.230 --> 59:19.070
The fact that I know I'm drunk
is proof that I'm sober.

59:19.190 --> 59:21.530
This isn't a real bar...

59:21.650 --> 59:26.160
...and this isn't real alcohol,
and you're not a real bartender.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.660
Right?

59:29.740 --> 59:31.790
I'm sober...

59:32.950 --> 59:38.040
...even if odds and sods
go around in my head.

59:40.340 --> 59:42.630
Paprika will come, right?

59:50.050 --> 59:52.600
Do you not like the number 17?

59:55.060 --> 59:58.440
The conspiratorial 17.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:06.360
You're familiar with movies
as if you've made them before.

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:13.240
I did. Shot an independent
on an 8mm.

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.250
It was child's play.

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.920
When you were in high school?

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.290
When I was 17-

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.980
It's a silly cop story.

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:46.740
Two men
who used to be best friends...

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:50.910
...are now fugitive and cop
engaged in a chase.

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:55.290
They just keep running...

01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:58.620
...and flashbacks of their past
play throughout.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.630
Very experimental.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.800
That guy...

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.050
How could I have forgotten
about him until now?

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.430
He was always one step
ahead of me.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.060
He was smart and popular
with the girls.

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.570
I could never catch up with him.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.950
I was frustrated at myself
for not being frustrated with him.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.740
He really was a good guy.

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:36.330
We talked about
making movies together.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:43.080
But I gave up.
I didn't have the confidence.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:46.380
I left the unfinished movie
for him to deal with.

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:50.470
And that friend now?

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.630
He died.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.730
He had just gotten accepted
to film school, but he was sick.

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:03.230
He didn't tell me.

01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:06.150
I betrayed him.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.650
I was his partner.
I was his counterpart.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.610
He was the other-

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.780
The other me.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:31.970
But what about the rest of it?!

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.330
Wait!

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.870
- Why do you dress like a girl?
- Paprika!

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.540
The real you is
more befitting of me.

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:03.500
Paprika!

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.340
Stop, please...

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.760
...you jealous, perverted prince!

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:17.180
You have a bad habit of trying
to manipulate people with your words.

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:20.470
And you think you can
manipulate people with power?

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:23.310
In here, yes.

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:34.170
I love you.

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.740
I love you as you are.

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:20.530
I will show no mercy
for those who defy me.

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.990
Chairman...

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.210
You cannot hide anything from me.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.470
Chairman, not her. Not her!

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:39.510
Can you not control
even one sensual desire?

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.730
Please! Please spare her!

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:51.690
Why won't you obey me?
You are nothing without me!

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.950
But I love her.

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.540
Paprika!

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:13.210
Are you okay?

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.720
I knew you were Paprika.

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:25.180
What are you doing? You will obey!

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.400
Disgusting.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:42.370
You fool.
Swayed by a mere woman.

01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:01.800
I'm too anxious to dream!

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:04.680
Konakawa?

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:07.720
Shima? Is that you?

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:09.390
Konakawa.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:14.190
- Why are you in Chiba's dream?
- Why are you a monkey?

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.570
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later. Just go!

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:19.280
Go where?

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.740
To your dream!

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:39.010
Don't get in the way of my dream!

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.930
This is my dream. You get out!

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:54.190
I am justice!

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.700
Freeze!

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.410
How's that for traumatic?

01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:21.210
What about the rest of it?!

01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:26.140
It's coming up right now!

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.140
This time, I'll end it!

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:36.730
That hurts.

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:48.570
It's over.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.130
Chief.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.170
Is this really the real world?

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.590
I think so.

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:48.300
See? It hurt a lot.

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:57.189
But why was Konakawa in your dream?

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:01.899
That's right, Paprika was saved
by Mr. Konakawa.

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:06.189
The chairman and Osanai...

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:09.279
Tokita! What about Tokita?

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.510
Osanai! What's wrong?

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:27.840
Osanai!

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:34.060
No! No! Osanai! You can't go!

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.810
That body is mine!
I will not allow you to act on your own!

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.689
My noble spirit needs that body!

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:48.990
When the two become one,
I will be complete!

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.120
Something's wrong.

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:59.410
Not just Tokita, but what
just happened with Osanai.

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:03.210
Don't worry.
We just need to get the mastermind.

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.250
A happy ending
is right around the corner.

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:11.470
But that mastermind
is lost in his own delusion.

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.640
No problem.

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:16.060
We have backup.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.890
Mr. Konakawa.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.730
The number you called for
assisting young children...

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:28.740
...is not available because of
crowded tires in the Pacific Ocean...

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.320
...starting at 7:63 a. m.

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:04.730
The battle has ended.

01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:11.570
Now it's showtime!

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:39.930
Today's weather is dreamy...

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.640
...and will clear up after a sunny,
sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny day.

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:47.110
The dream I had yesterday
and today.

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:49.860
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:55.160
The dreams will grow and grow.
Let's grow the tree that blooms money.

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.780
It's most valuable
while it's still a bud.

01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:01.910
That's right, so we shall preserve
the memory forever.

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:05.870
If there is no flower,
there will be no fruit.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.670
If there's nothing,
then I won't do anything.

01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:15.180
If you're unhappy,
please put a vote in this eyeball.

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:18.850
Who would give up this throne?

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:22.560
I am the emperor,
chosen by the lord himself!

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.680
- I didn't choose you!
- I didn't choose you!

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:28.100
God and Buddha
will change religions.

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:35.240
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:38.660
Am I still dreaming?

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:42.490
Yes, the whole world is.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.750
You forgot this.

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:52.050
Thank you.

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:54.460
- Now, let's go.
- Where?

01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:58.010
To clean up this mess.

01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:09.350
Dreams and reality are merging?

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.020
Is this because of the DC Mini too?

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.450
Chief! Hold on!

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.760
Paprika?

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:43.890
No time for questions. Hurry up!

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.850
Why are you here?

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:52.110
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.110
Hurry! We have to get
the mastermind!

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.450
It's as if we're in a dream.

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.250
Hurry!

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:10.120
Don't get ahead
of yourself, Paprika!

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:16.250
Don't think you're always right.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.450
Tokita.

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:52.000
- Let's go, Atsuko.
- I have to help Tokita.

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:54.540
Leave that irresponsible fatso.

01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:00.550
Why don't you listen?
You're a part of me!

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.930
Have you ever thought
that maybe you are a part of me?

01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:06.390
Do as I say!

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.940
To think that you can control
yourself and others.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.400
You're just like an old baldy I know.

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:24.070
Let's go. We need to stop
that old baldy and his excursions.

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.360
- Now!
- No!

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:29.130
I can't just leave Tokita because I...

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.370
Because what?

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:39.880
Chiba!

01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:44.050
She's become true to herself,
hasn't she?

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.050
An overweight spirit needs no diet!

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.390
Go forward, superhero,
to anywhere you please!

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.060
Tokita, wake up! It's me!

01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:57.730
The one I've been waiting for
since historic times!

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.440
Your flute's melody
is a sound for sore neurons!

01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.110
Yes, try to remember.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.700
Atsuko, the one you like!
It's me, At-chan!

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.080
A fragrant fat is a first-class lunch!

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:17.790
It needs a little more spice.

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:20.670
Maybe a little paprika?

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.280
What is this?

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.280
A big hole.

01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:47.770
I can see that!

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.950
- It's connected.
- To the other world.

01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:57.370
The other- You mean...?

01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:00.460
What should we do?

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.130
- Run?
- You think so too?

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.640
Well-rounded achievement
is missing a spice.

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:17.560
Paprika found!

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:37.250
Paprika! Shima!
Are you two okay?

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.170
- Mr. Konakawa!
- Konakawa.

01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:54.470
Chiba?

01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:07.110
I'm in a bind.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.320
I can see that.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.990
It's not that!

01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:34.720
Sorry.

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:38.770
You're such a slob.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.730
I know.

01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:45.440
You're fat, slow and sloppy.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.740
It's not the outside that counts,
but there's a limit to that too.

01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:53.570
Yeah.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:58.700
To think, a food disposal like you
is the genius of the century.

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.460
I swallow everything.

01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:08.380
I know. You're so much fun.

01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:15.970
Atsuko is dreaming.

01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:35.200
- What is that?
- Our chairman!

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:37.780
I feel great!

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:41.200
I am reborn!

01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:50.550
Look! I am standing!
With my own legs!

01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:51.970
I am perfect!

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.970
I can control the dreams,
and even death!

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:01.390
Now, to make
the cosmos complete...

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.900
...I shall heal all deficiencies!

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.940
Way to go, Lord of Darkness!

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:17.410
Light and dark. Reality and dreams.
Life and death. Man and...?

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:19.870
- Woman?
- Woman?

01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:22.870
Then you add the missing spice.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.910
- Paprika?
- Paprika?

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.040
Bingo.

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.920
Paprika!

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.350
The new cosmos begins with me!

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.610
Who is eating up my dream?

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:38.990
Is that Paprika?

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.240
Well, it's a girl.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.710
Why won't you obey?

01:22:57.030 --> 01:23:00.650
Have we awoken from the dream?

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.760
I just had the best dream.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.770
I had a good dream too.
The first in a long time.

01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:45.910
- I guess I've been dumped.
- You mean you were serious?

01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:48.950
But Paprika is a woman
in your dreams.

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:53.540
That's true. I'll see her
in my dreams again some day.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.710
How are your dreams going?

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.840
I almost forgot about it.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.720
Did you find out
what was causing it?

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:06.720
The cause...

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.730
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.690
You just lived out our movie
in real life.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.990
That's why you became a cop.

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:26.740
It's truth that came from fiction.
Always remember that.

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:31.080
Yeah, all the truths and the fiction.

01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:42.570
Welcome.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.100
I have a message for you
from Miss Paprika.

01:24:55.730 --> 01:25:00.650
I heard you caught the perpetrator in
that homicide case. Congratulations.

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.070
I also have an announcement:

01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:08.620
Atsuko's last name
will change to Tokita.

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:11.870
P.S.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.500
The movie Dreaming Kids
was very good. I recommend it.

01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:31.510
Dreaming Kids

01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:42.050
One adult, please.
