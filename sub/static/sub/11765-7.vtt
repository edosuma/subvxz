WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.504
OH. IT'S NOON.
FIRST WINE OF THE DAY.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.137
MMM.

00:06.137 --> 00:08.479
ELLIE!

00:09.640 --> 00:12.143
THANKS, BOO.
MM!

00:12.143 --> 00:14.315
WHEN YOU HAVE A HUSBAND
THAT'S BEEN WRAPPED

00:14.315 --> 00:16.317
AROUND YOUR FINGER
SINCE THE DAY YOU MET,

00:16.317 --> 00:17.718
YOU CAN DO THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.751
AND THIS.

00:20.751 --> 00:22.223
(gasps)

00:23.794 --> 00:25.556
HELLO AGAIN.

00:25.556 --> 00:27.428
W--
I'M SURE GRAYSON

00:27.428 --> 00:29.630
PAYS ATTENTION TO YOU
LIKE THAT.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.362
WATCH AND LEARN, GIRLFRIEND.

00:31.362 --> 00:32.633
(chuckles)

00:34.065 --> 00:36.637
GRAYSON, WHERE WERE YOU?

00:36.637 --> 00:39.710
I'M RELAXING. COULD YOU MAYBE
NOT POUR WINE ON THE COUNTER?

00:39.710 --> 00:42.443
COULD YOU MAYBE PRETEND
THAT YOU LOVE ME?

00:42.443 --> 00:47.248
(western theme playing)

00:55.186 --> 00:56.587
STOP SPILLING WINE!

00:56.587 --> 00:58.329
STOP NOT CATCHING IT!

00:58.329 --> 01:01.092
AMATEURS. (laughs)

01:01.092 --> 01:02.333
MMM.

01:02.333 --> 01:08.739
REALLY?

01:08.739 --> 01:10.741
(grunts)
OKAY, I DON'T CARE

01:10.741 --> 01:13.374
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO MY ISLAND
AS LONG AS IT'S CONSENSUAL.

01:13.374 --> 01:17.308
WADE IS FINALLY COMING BACK
FROM AFGHANISTAN TOMORROW.

01:17.308 --> 01:21.482
IF I DON'T STRETCH IT OUT,
I COULD SPRAIN MY SNOOZE.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.584
I'VE HEARD YOU CALL IT
A SIZZLE, A HOO,

01:23.584 --> 01:26.157
A HOT POCKET...
BONNIE HUNT.

01:26.157 --> 01:27.518
A NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN...

01:27.518 --> 01:29.360
WOOLLY MAMMOTH.
THE HURT LOCKER.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.662
JELLY IS A VAGINA THESAURUS.

01:31.662 --> 01:33.224
OH. (chuckles)

01:34.565 --> 01:37.268
A VAGINASAURUS.
BEST DINOSAUR EVER.

01:37.268 --> 01:39.099
HEY, JULES, GOOD NEWS.
HMM?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.601
THAT COUPLE FROM YESTERDAY WANTS
TO COME BACK AND SEE MY HOUSE.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.133
(gasps)

01:42.133 --> 01:43.574
I THINK THEY MIGHT PUT DOWN
AN OFFER.

01:43.574 --> 01:47.638
NEW NEIGHBORS?
WHY WAS I NOT ASKED TO APPROVE?

01:47.638 --> 01:49.840
YOU KNOW HOW YOU HATE
EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING?

01:49.840 --> 01:51.512
YES.
THAT.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.743
GOT IT.
BUT, GUYS,

01:52.743 --> 01:54.315
THIS NEW COUPLE IS GONNA
BE PERFECT,

01:54.315 --> 01:55.716
EXCEPT FOR THEY ARE
INTO HEALTHY LIVING.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.117
BLECH!
NO.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.220
THEY'RE VEGAN.
HATE THAT.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.421
WHAT?!
AND ACTUALLY,
THEY DON'T DRINK.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.892
I FORBID IT!
NO SALE!

02:01.892 --> 02:03.494
YEAH, SCREW THOSE GUYS!

02:03.494 --> 02:06.697
I MEAN, WHO NEEDS
THEIR $226,000? WE DON'T.

02:06.697 --> 02:09.630
(women chant) WE DON'T.
WE DON'T. WE DON'T. WE DON'T.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.532
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE DO.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.404
I KNEW THAT.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.466
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WADE COMES HOME TOMORROW,

02:15.466 --> 02:18.539
AND I STILL HAVE TO SEW, LIKE,
THREE MORE SEXY COSTUMES.

02:18.539 --> 02:22.343
HONEY, CUTTING CROTCHES
OUT OF PANTS IS NOT SEWING.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.215
OKAY, YOU KNOW
HOW I LOVE THOSE VIDEOS

02:24.215 --> 02:26.417
OF SOLDIERS COMING HOME
TO SURPRISE THEIR FAMILIES?

02:26.417 --> 02:27.678
TOTALLY.

02:27.678 --> 02:29.720
ANYWAY, IT TURNS OUT

02:29.720 --> 02:33.184
THAT WADE'S NOT COMING HOME
TOMORROW.

02:33.184 --> 02:34.555
WHAT?
SURPRISE!

02:34.555 --> 02:36.557
OH.
OH!

02:36.557 --> 02:39.159
UH, THIS WASN'T TURNED ON YET.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.391
OH, MY GOD!

02:40.391 --> 02:42.233
(high-pitched voice)
WADE! WADE! WADE!

02:42.233 --> 02:43.764
DO IT AGAIN! DO IT AGAIN!

02:43.764 --> 02:46.637
ARE WE REALLY WATCHING
"PRETTY WOMAN"?
SHUSH IT.

02:46.637 --> 02:48.699
HE'S ABOUT TO CLOSE
THE NECKLACE BOX ON HER FINGERS.

02:48.699 --> 02:50.571
OH!

02:50.571 --> 02:51.802
OOH!

02:51.802 --> 02:53.274
(high-pitched voice) OH!
(laughs)

02:53.274 --> 02:56.307
(normal voice) AND BOOM!
A STAR IS BORN.

02:56.307 --> 02:58.649
YOU GUYS DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE
ROM-COMS, DO YOU?

02:58.649 --> 03:01.352
I MEAN, THEY'RE ALL DUMB CLICHES
AND HACKY MEET-CUTES.

03:01.352 --> 03:03.284
NO REAL COUPLES
EVER MEET LIKE THAT.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.685
EVERY GREAT COUPLE HAS
A MEET-CUTE STORY--

03:04.685 --> 03:06.186
ADAM AND EVE.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.918
JAY-Z AND BEYONCE.

03:07.918 --> 03:09.320
OH, YOU AND MY MOM.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.721
HEY, WAIT.
WHAT WAS YOURS AGAIN?

03:10.721 --> 03:12.463
SHE CAME OVER
TO BORROW A PLUNGER.

03:12.463 --> 03:13.664
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
I WASN'T READY.

03:13.664 --> 03:15.195
TELL IT AGAIN
FROM THE BEGINNING.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.827
OH, I HAD A GREAT MEET-CUTE
WITH TRAV.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.969
THEY PULLED HIM OUT
AND PUT HIM IN MY ARMS.

03:18.969 --> 03:20.831
BUT THEY FORGOT TO TELL ME
HOW SLIPPERY HE WAS.

03:20.831 --> 03:23.334
HE KINDA JUST
GOT AWAY FROM ME.

03:23.334 --> 03:25.536
HENCE, SQUARE HEAD.

03:25.536 --> 03:27.308
KILLS AT PARTIES.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.942
WE JUST LOVE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:31.942 --> 03:33.744
WHAT A GREAT YOGA YARD.

03:33.744 --> 03:35.416
(chuckles)
TELL ME ABOUT IT, SISTER.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.419
THERE'S NOTHING THAT I LOVE
MORE THAN YOGA.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.621
WE SHOULD MEET EVERY MORNING.
(under breath) MAKE ME STOP.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.922
(chuckles)

03:41.922 --> 03:45.356
HEY, NEIGHBOR!
WELCOME TO THE SAC!

03:45.356 --> 03:47.298
ANDY, PUT AWAY TOBEY MAGUIRE!

03:47.298 --> 03:49.760
OH.
I HATE THAT I KNOW
YOU NAMED IT THAT.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.963
(tires screech)
YO! I'M PUTTING A MILITIA
TOGETHER.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.606
YOU SONS OF BITCHES READY
TO TAKE THE COUNTRY BACK?

03:55.606 --> 03:59.770
ANDY, ARE YOU COMING?
I HAD TO START WITHOUT YOU.

03:59.770 --> 04:03.374
(gasps) OH! ARE YOU TWO
THE NEW NEIGHBORS?

04:03.374 --> 04:06.517
HOT DAMN,
YOU TWO HAVE PRETTY MOUTHS.

04:06.517 --> 04:07.978
PLUS, WITH THOSE BIKE SHORTS,

04:07.978 --> 04:09.380
YOU CAN TOTALLY SEE
WHAT HE'S PACKING.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.282
(Andy) CHECK IT.
(Ellie) OH.

04:11.282 --> 04:12.953
SERIOUSLY?!

04:12.953 --> 04:16.657
OH! I THINK I SWEATED OFF
MY BIRTH CONTROL PATCH.

04:16.657 --> 04:17.988
AHH.

04:17.988 --> 04:20.391
BABY, WHAT IS
ALL OVER YOUR HEAD?
HUH?

04:20.391 --> 04:22.433
OH, IT'S JUST
SOME OF THAT DRYWALL.

04:22.433 --> 04:23.894
OH.

04:23.894 --> 04:25.466
SORRY.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.867
(both laugh)

04:26.867 --> 04:28.899
SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING BACK
TO MINNESOTA?

04:28.899 --> 04:31.041
I'M SURE YOUR FAMILY
AND ALL YOUR BUDDIES

04:31.041 --> 04:32.443
REALLY WANNA SEE YOU.

04:32.443 --> 04:33.944
OH, I'M BACK FOR GOOD.

04:33.944 --> 04:36.747
I JUST WANT TO SPEND
AS MUCH TIME WITH YOU AS I CAN.

04:36.747 --> 04:39.550
HOW LONG DO I GET TO KEEP YOU
HERE IN FLORIDA?

04:39.550 --> 04:40.851
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

04:40.851 --> 04:43.384
UNTIL, UH... QUESTION MARK?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.716
MMM.
MMM.

04:45.716 --> 04:47.287
(chuckles)

04:49.420 --> 04:51.021
OH. WHAT WAS THAT?

04:51.021 --> 04:52.493
NO, I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.
YOU GOOD? YEAH?

04:52.493 --> 04:54.895
YEAH.
OKAY. (chuckles)

04:54.895 --> 04:56.467
ALL RIGHT,

04:56.467 --> 05:00.070
EVERYBODY, EMPTY YOUR POCKETS
RIGHT NOW.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.673
COME ON. YOU'RE GONNA
PAY ME BACK EVERY CENT

05:02.673 --> 05:04.405
YOU JUST LOST ME ON THAT HOUSE.
LET'S GO.

05:05.476 --> 05:06.777
$20,

05:06.777 --> 05:08.909
$51

05:08.909 --> 05:10.881
AND A...

05:10.881 --> 05:12.513
THAT'S MY TREASURE MAP.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.944
FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME,

05:13.944 --> 05:15.646
THAT IS A MENU
FROM LONG JOHN SILVER'S.

05:15.646 --> 05:19.319
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL APOLOGIZE
TO GRAYSON.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.021
I'M SORRY, BABE.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.853
SORRY, BABE.
SORRY, G-MAN.

05:24.455 --> 05:25.696
THEY WERE WEARING
SPANDEX SHORTS.

05:25.696 --> 05:27.327
I DO NOT APOLOGIZE.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.460
THOSE PEOPLE COULD'VE
TURNED OUT TO BE GREAT.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.363
WE CAN'T CHOOSE OUR NEIGHBORS
ON FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

05:32.363 --> 05:33.764
I MEAN,
IF YOU HAD DONE THAT,

05:33.764 --> 05:35.866
NONE OF US WOULD BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

05:35.866 --> 05:37.067
WHEN JULES
AND BOBBY THE CABLE GUY HERE

05:37.067 --> 05:38.609
TRIED TO BUY THIS HOUSE,

05:38.609 --> 05:40.371
I WAS NOT THRILLED.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.873
WHAT WAS SO AWFUL
ABOUT JULES?

05:42.873 --> 05:44.415
(thick Southern accent)
PEANUT.

05:44.415 --> 05:46.417
YOU GOT IT, HOT LIPS.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.348
MMM.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.381
OH, BABY.

05:50.381 --> 05:52.022
IT'S PERFECT!

05:54.024 --> 05:56.727
OH, MY GOD. REDNECKS.

05:56.727 --> 05:57.928
HEY, LADY!

05:57.928 --> 06:00.461
OH, I DON'T WANT THAT.

06:05.396 --> 06:06.767
MAN, I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR THIS STORY.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.639
YOU WERE THERE,
YOU HILLBILLY.

06:08.639 --> 06:11.702
YEAH, BUT MY MEMORY'S A LITTLE
SHAKY EVER SINCE YOU...

06:12.843 --> 06:14.775
(laughs) I CAN'T REMEMBER.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.878
WHEN I NEED TO JOG MY MEMORY,
I JUST JOLT MY BRAIN LIKE THIS.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.652
THAT PLUS THAT EQUALS ME.

06:21.652 --> 06:23.954
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU TWO
EVER BECAME FRIENDS.

06:23.954 --> 06:26.987
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE
A LOVABLE LITTLE PUPPY...
OOH.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.119
AND YOU'RE LIKE
A LADY WHO EATS PUPPIES.

06:29.119 --> 06:31.722
IS IT WEIRD THAT
THAT MAKES ME HUNGRY?

06:31.722 --> 06:33.794
SWEETIE, I WOULD LOVE...

06:33.794 --> 06:36.096
A BURGER AND FRIES. ON IT.

06:38.899 --> 06:43.033
(laughs) MAN, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
J-BIRD BACK IN THE DAY.

06:43.033 --> 06:46.607
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE WERE
A BIT ON THE WHITE TRASH SIDE.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.609
CAN YOU PLEASE
NOT TALK ABOUT THAT?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.140
I MEAN, I'M NOT LIKE THAT
ANYMORE.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.583
YOUR PAST IS WHO YOU ARE.
YOU HAVE TO OWN IT.

06:52.583 --> 06:53.984
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.150
WHAT? IT FEELS GOOD.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.892
WAIT. WAIT UP!

07:01.892 --> 07:05.025
HI. I'M JULES.
YOU CAN CALL ME J-BIRD.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.727
NO, THANK YOU.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.829
REGINALD BUTTBART III.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.902
(laughs) JOKING.
NAME'S BOBBY COBB.

07:11.902 --> 07:14.034
ARE YOU TWO
FROM PLANET NASCAR?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.736
OH, THAT IS A NICE SUIT.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.167
ARE YOU A WEATHER GIRL?

07:17.167 --> 07:18.669
I'M A LAWYER.

07:18.669 --> 07:20.010
OOH.
A GIRL LAWYER?

07:20.010 --> 07:22.943
WOW! THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A TV SHOW.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.475
(gruff voice) WE GOTTA
SHAKE UP THIS CASE.

07:24.475 --> 07:25.916
BRING IN GIRL LAWYER.

07:25.916 --> 07:28.218
YEAH, BABY! IT'S LIKE
"MATLOCK" WITH KNOCKERS.

07:28.218 --> 07:30.521
HEY. SO WE REALLY LOVE
THIS HOUSE.

07:30.521 --> 07:31.952
DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S SELLING IT?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.555
ACTUALLY, ANDY AND I ARE.
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.727
WE'RE GONNA BE GIRLFRIENDS,
GIRLFRIEND.

07:36.727 --> 07:38.789
ME AND YOU JUST TANNING
OUR CHEEKS

07:38.789 --> 07:41.231
ON THE FRONT LAWN TOGETHER.
I DON'T TAN CHEEKS.

07:41.231 --> 07:44.495
OH, HONEY, NO MAN WANTS
TO TAP A WHITE ASS.

07:44.495 --> 07:46.196
THANK YOU FOR THAT TIP.

07:46.196 --> 07:48.238
OH, WAIT. DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THIS ANDY FELLA IS?

07:48.238 --> 07:49.640

07:49.640 --> 07:51.201
HEAVEN?
SPACE?

07:51.201 --> 07:53.173
ON THE ROOF?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.775
(gasps) WELL, THAT WAS
ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.047
I WANT YOU

07:57.047 --> 07:58.949
OH, COME, BABY. (moans)

07:58.949 --> 08:00.751
WAIT A SECOND.

08:00.751 --> 08:03.684
IF ELLIE DIDN'T LIKE YOU,
WHY DID SHE AGREE TO SELL?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.485
SHE DIDN'T.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.919
(Andy screaming)

08:08.919 --> 08:10.260
OH! OH!

08:10.260 --> 08:12.763
(gasps)
(choir vocalizes)

08:12.763 --> 08:14.765
HEY, YOU.

08:14.765 --> 08:16.897
HEY.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.029
AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
A MEET-CUTE.
(pas back)

08:19.029 --> 08:21.201
GET SOME FRIENDS
YOUR OWN AGE.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.773
(chuckles)

08:27.137 --> 08:28.639
CAN I GET YOU TWO ANYTHING?

08:28.639 --> 08:31.141

08:31.141 --> 08:33.213
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?
I'M GONNA CALL MOM.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.916
OKAY. HURRY BACK, BABY.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.187
(thud)

08:37.187 --> 08:39.890
DID THAT HURT?
YES.

08:40.951 --> 08:43.624
ANDY, I CAN'T DO THIS.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.195
OW!

08:45.195 --> 08:49.129
I DON'T THINK THAT WADE'S
EVER GOING HOME.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.302
GOOD. IT'D BE NICE NOT BEING
THE ONLY MINORITY AROUND HERE.

08:52.302 --> 08:54.805
OH, RIGHT.

08:54.805 --> 08:56.767
YOU'RE HISPANIC.
I ALWAYS FORGET THAT.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.639
YEAH, ME, TOO.

08:58.639 --> 09:02.943
ANDY, WADE SAID HE'S PLANNING
TO STAY "UNTIL QUESTION MARK."

09:02.943 --> 09:04.274
WHEN I'M AT A PARTY
UNTIL QUESTION MARK,

09:04.274 --> 09:06.617
IT MEANS I'M NEVER LEAVING.

09:06.617 --> 09:09.179
ONCE I WAS AT A RAVE SO LONG
THAT I FORGOT MY OWN NAME,

09:09.179 --> 09:11.882
SHAVED MY HEAD, AND EVERYONE
STARTED CALLING ME SASHA.

09:11.882 --> 09:13.553
IT TURNS OUT I WAS
ACTUALLY IN A CULT.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.185
THEY WERE FUN GUYS.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.958
THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW. MM.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.060
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME,
TRAV.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.632
GOLF HEAVEN, FLORIDA.

09:21.632 --> 09:23.764
IT'S GULFHAVEN, BOBBY.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.236
(gasps) OH, LOOK.
IT'S GIRL LAWYER.

09:26.236 --> 09:27.898
WATCH ME MAKE FRIENDS.

09:27.898 --> 09:29.670
(Ellie) ALL RIGHT, BUT I NEED
THOSE BRIEFS TODAY.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.903
WELL, I'LL TRY, BUT I AM SWAMPED
WITH OTHER LAW STUFF.

09:32.903 --> 09:35.075
OKAY. BUT LET'S SKIP
THE MOTION TO DISMISS

09:35.075 --> 09:37.207
AND JUST MOVE
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT NOW.

09:37.207 --> 09:38.779
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.812
I HEAR JUDGE WAPNER'S
IN A CRAP MOOD.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.014
I'M ON THE PHONE!
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT FUNNY.

09:44.014 --> 09:45.716
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.888
TONIGHT'S OUR FIRST NIGHT
IN THE NEW HOUSE.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.620
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND ANDY
COME OVER FOR DINNER?

09:49.620 --> 09:51.221
I'LL COOK YOU
SOMETHING REAL NICE.

09:51.221 --> 09:52.923
SQUIRREL?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

09:52.923 --> 09:55.195
IT'S SUMMER.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.797
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.028
OH, I GET IT.

09:58.028 --> 09:59.800
YOU'RE
THE LONELY, NEEDY GIRL

09:59.800 --> 10:02.372
WHO PUSHES HER WAY
INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES.

10:02.372 --> 10:03.934
SO SAD.

10:03.934 --> 10:06.837
HAVE A GREAT DAY, Y'ALL.

10:06.837 --> 10:08.238
HER-DEE-DER!

10:08.238 --> 10:10.040
YEAH! HER-DEE-DER!

10:10.040 --> 10:13.013
I AM NOT NEEDY!

10:13.013 --> 10:15.245
I'M GONNA MAKE THAT
PALE-ASS ICY BITCH LOVE ME

10:15.245 --> 10:17.848
WHETHER SHE LIKES IT OR NOT.

10:17.848 --> 10:19.950
WAIT. WHERE'S TRAVIS?

10:19.950 --> 10:23.754
в™Єв™Єв™Є

10:31.702 --> 10:33.934
OH!

10:33.934 --> 10:37.808
OH! DRINK UP, BITCH!

10:37.808 --> 10:39.269
WHOA.

10:39.269 --> 10:41.772
WHAT? YOU NEVER SEEN COUSINS
FOUNTAIN-FIGHT

10:41.772 --> 10:43.113
OVER A JEFF GORDON
SWEAT RAG?

10:43.113 --> 10:44.945
(siren wailing)

10:44.945 --> 10:46.646
CATCH YOU LATER, CUTIE.

10:49.219 --> 10:51.381
EVEN YOU AND LAURIE
HAD A MEET-CUTE?

10:51.381 --> 10:53.684
IF YOU'RE ASKING IF WE HAD
A MOMENT IN WHICH DESTINY ITSELF

10:53.684 --> 10:55.826
REACHED DOWN AND TAPPED US
ON THE SHOULDERS,

10:55.826 --> 10:57.988
AS IF TO SAY, "YOU COULD
ONE DAY END UP TOGETHER,"

10:57.988 --> 11:00.430
THEN THE ANSWER IS
YES, WE HAD THAT MOMENT,

11:00.430 --> 11:03.033
AND NO, YOU DID NOT.

11:03.033 --> 11:05.896
OH, HONEY. DID YOU NOT TELL THEM
ABOUT OUR PLUNGER STORY?

11:12.142 --> 11:13.944
I WAS GONE FOR 30 SECONDS.

11:13.944 --> 11:15.946
THERE WERE TWO BURGERS
AND FRIES IN THERE.

11:15.946 --> 11:18.779
I EAT WHEN I'M FREAKED,
OKAY?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.180
I LOVE WADE,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.282
BUT UNTIL YESTERDAY,
HE WAS JUST A LONG DISTY.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.084
AND, YES, I MAYBE TOLD HIM
THAT I WANTED TO HAVE

11:24.084 --> 11:26.817
BEAUTIFUL HALF-BLACK, NATURALLY
BLONDE BABIES WITH HIM,

11:26.817 --> 11:28.188
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M READY

11:28.188 --> 11:29.990
FOR THINGS TO BE
SUPER SERIOUS.
(sighs)

11:29.990 --> 11:32.793
I REALLY THINK THAT HE AND I
NEED TO SLOW THINGS DOWN.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.294
YEAH,
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.196
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN TAKING IT SLOW
FOR OVER A YEAR,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.198
AND NOW HE'S HOME
AND HE'S PROBABLY LOOKING TO SEE

11:38.198 --> 11:40.430
IF THIS IS GONNA BE
SOMETHING REAL.

11:40.430 --> 11:43.904
LAURIE, YOU'RE EITHER ON THAT
TRAIN WITH HIM OR YOU'RE NOT.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.375
MAYBE HE'S NOT
TOTALLY ON IT.

11:45.375 --> 11:49.009
MAYBE HE WANTS TO SLOW THE TRAIN
DOWN, TOO, YOU KNOW?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.380
HEY. SORRY.
OH. HI. HI.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.112
HEY. UM, MOM WON'T LET ME
GET OFF THE PHONE

11:52.112 --> 11:54.014
UNTIL I TELL YOU YOU'RE INVITED
FOR EASTER.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.816
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.047
YEAH.

11:57.047 --> 11:59.750
ALL ABOARD!

11:59.750 --> 12:02.252
(knocks on door)

12:02.252 --> 12:06.196
HI. I'M NOT MUCH OF A WINE GAL,
BUT THIS GUY I MET DOWNTOWN

12:06.196 --> 12:09.129
TOLD ME THIS STUFF IS PERFECT
FOR MAKING FRIENDS.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.461
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

12:11.461 --> 12:13.133
OW! AH!

12:13.133 --> 12:14.935
WHY WOULD YOU PUT YOUR FOOT
IN THE DOOR

12:14.935 --> 12:16.506
IF YOU'RE NOT WEARING SHOES?

12:16.506 --> 12:18.909
SEEMS DUMB NOW.

12:18.909 --> 12:21.271
OH, YEAH.
THIS TOENAIL'S A GONER.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.844
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE THERE?
DO YOU NEED A BANJO?

12:23.844 --> 12:26.516
GREAT. MORE REDNECK JOKES.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.979
SO... TELL ME
ABOUT YOU AND ANDY.

12:28.979 --> 12:30.981
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN MARRIED?

12:30.981 --> 12:33.824
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.
OH. IS HE GAY?

12:33.824 --> 12:35.255
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT THIS.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.486
(gasps) ARE YOU GAY?

12:36.486 --> 12:38.859
LOOK, YOU DRESS LIKE A BOY.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.431
I'VE DIED,
AND THIS IS MY HELL.

12:41.431 --> 12:42.833
WELL, WHY AREN'T
YOU TWO MARRIED?

12:42.833 --> 12:44.134
W--DOESN'T HE LOVE YOU?

12:44.134 --> 12:45.335
YES.

12:45.335 --> 12:47.367
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.039
HERE IT COMES.

12:49.039 --> 12:51.341
(sighs) I LOVE THAT
HAIRY LITTLE BALD GUY SO MUCH,

12:51.341 --> 12:53.173
BUT WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR THREE YEARS.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.175
HE STILL HASN'T PULLED
THE TRIGGER.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.048
HE'S GOT ME WRAPPED AROUND
HIS FINGER, J-BIRD.

12:58.048 --> 13:00.050
WHAT IF HE NEVER ASKS?

13:00.050 --> 13:01.812
(clicks tongue)

13:03.513 --> 13:05.015
WHAT DID I DO?

13:09.089 --> 13:13.123
PROMISE ME
YOU'LL NEVER TELL ANYONE THIS.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.325
I PROMISE.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.327
(gasps) RIGHT.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.499
SHOOT.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.936
LET'S START WITH THE BAD THING
I DID. I TOLD YOUR SECRET.

13:25.936 --> 13:28.879
BUT THE GREAT THING?
I KEPT IT FOR YEARS.

13:28.879 --> 13:30.380
THE ONLY SECRET I KEPT LONGER

13:30.380 --> 13:33.243
WAS THE ONE ABOUT TRAVIS AND HIS
SECOND GRADE GIRLFRIEND--

13:33.243 --> 13:35.185
THIS BLONDE GAL NAMED ERIN,

13:35.185 --> 13:38.018
WHO, TURNS OUT,
WASN'T A GIRL.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.992
I'M NOT KIDDING.
THEY ACTUALLY KISSED.

13:41.992 --> 13:44.324
I-I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO UPSET.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.328
BECAUSE WHEN WE MET,
I WAS A SUCCESSFUL ATTORNEY.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.100
JULES, I USED TO
MAKE JUDGES CRY.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.032
THEY CALLED ME
"TIGER BITCH."

13:52.032 --> 13:53.563
GRAYSON STILL DOES.

13:53.563 --> 13:56.466
NOW THE ONE THING THAT MAKES ME
FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF

13:56.466 --> 13:58.238
IS THAT I HAVE A HUSBAND

13:58.238 --> 14:01.271
WHO HAS WORSHIPPED ME
SINCE THE DAY WE MET.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.944
I FEEL EMBARRASSED NOW
THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT

14:03.944 --> 14:07.117
THAT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE.

14:07.117 --> 14:09.379
(clicks tongue) I'M SORRY.

14:09.379 --> 14:11.251
IT'S OKAY.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.883
QUESTION--

14:12.883 --> 14:15.325
DOES TRAVIS KNOW
THAT ERIN WAS A BOY?

14:15.325 --> 14:17.557
DON'T EVER TELL HIM.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.989
(Bobby) AND WHEN I GOT
TO THE OTHER END

14:18.989 --> 14:20.961
OF THAT SPAGHETTI STRING,

14:20.961 --> 14:22.893
THERE HE WAS.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.196
THE ULTIMATE MEET-CUTE.

14:26.196 --> 14:28.868
SO YOU'RE CLAIMING YOU WENT
TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.140
DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT THEY ALSO SAT

14:30.140 --> 14:32.602
A 300-POUND ANIMAL
AT YOUR TABLE,

14:32.602 --> 14:35.075
AND THEN YOU AND THIS DOG

14:35.075 --> 14:36.977
ALSO PICKED UP THE OPPOSITE ENDS
OF THE SAME NOODLE,

14:36.977 --> 14:39.879
AND CONTINUED TO SLURP
UNTIL YOUR LIPS MET?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.411
SOUNDS REAL TO ME.

14:41.411 --> 14:42.882
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
THEY BECAME BEST FRIENDS.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.114
THE IDEA THAT THERE IS
SUCH A THING

14:44.114 --> 14:46.386
AS A SPONTANEOUS,
MAGICAL MOMENT

14:46.386 --> 14:49.920
WHERE TWO PEOPLE LOCK EYES
AND HAVE AN INSTANT CONNECTION

14:49.920 --> 14:51.521
IS STUPID AND FAKE

14:51.521 --> 14:53.363
AND... DAMN IT!

14:53.363 --> 14:56.026
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE HAD A MOMENT
LIKE THAT WITH JULES?!

14:56.026 --> 14:57.897
(Bobby snickers)

14:57.897 --> 14:59.399
TOLD YOU
THIS WOULD BE FUN.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.630
YEP.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.402
(clink)

15:02.402 --> 15:04.434
NO, MOM, LAURIE EATS HAM.

15:04.434 --> 15:07.377
OKAY, NO, Y-YOU DON'T HAVE TO
MAKE ANYTHING SPECIAL.

15:07.377 --> 15:11.411
IF WADE STAYS IN FLORIDA,
IT'S JUST TO BE WITH ME.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.682
THAT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

15:12.682 --> 15:14.484
I LIKE WADE.

15:14.484 --> 15:16.346
HE CORRECTED MY DOUGIE.

15:16.346 --> 15:18.949
I WAS PUTTING
WAY TOO MUCH ELBOW INTO IT.

15:18.949 --> 15:21.121
YEAH, HE'S A REALLY GOOD
DANCER.
YEAH, REALLY GOOD.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.224
BUT, ANDY, WHAT'S NEXT?
MARRIAGE?

15:24.224 --> 15:26.456
I'M USED TO HAVING
MY OWN SPACE.

15:26.456 --> 15:28.698
AND HIS BAGS ARE JUST SITTING
THERE IN MY LIVING ROOM,

15:28.698 --> 15:31.631
ALL PILED UP,
WAITIN' TO BE UNPACKED.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.164
LITERALLY
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

15:34.164 --> 15:37.007
MY WORST NIGHTMARE IS
CATS WALKING ON TWO LEGS.

15:37.007 --> 15:39.239
JUST... (meowing)

15:39.239 --> 15:41.011
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:41.011 --> 15:43.273
LOOK, LETTING WADE
INTO YOUR LIFE IS A BIG RISK,

15:43.273 --> 15:44.644
BUT GIVE IT A SHOT.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.476
IF IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,
THEN BAIL,

15:46.476 --> 15:48.478
BUT DON'T MISS OUT
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED.

15:48.478 --> 15:51.451
TRUST ME, I ALMOST MADE
THAT MISTAKE.

15:51.451 --> 15:56.226
HEY, YOU THINK I CAN GET
THIS PENNY IN THAT CAN?

15:56.226 --> 15:57.457
(clink)

15:57.457 --> 15:59.289
OHH!
WHOO-HOO! WHOO-HOO-HOO!

15:59.289 --> 16:02.092
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

16:02.092 --> 16:03.493
WHAT SHOULD WE CALL IT?

16:03.493 --> 16:05.465
(deep voice) PENNY TOSS.
(deep voice) PENNY TOSS.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.497
MM?
MM, NAH.
LET'S KEEP THINKING.

16:07.497 --> 16:09.469
MM? (chuckles)

16:09.469 --> 16:11.141
HEY!
MM!

16:11.141 --> 16:13.173
ARE YOU GONNA ASK ELLIE
TO MARRY YOU OR WHAT?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.644
UH, IS SHE SERIOUS?

16:14.644 --> 16:16.476
WELL?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.078
LOOK, LADY I JUST MET,

16:18.078 --> 16:20.550
ELLIE'S GREAT,
BUT I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS.

16:20.550 --> 16:23.153
I MEAN, IS SHE THE ONE?
WILL SHE BE A GOOD MOM?

16:23.153 --> 16:25.285
IS SHE ONLY WITH ME
BECAUSE HER MOM--

16:25.285 --> 16:28.258
AND I QUOTE--
HATES THE ETHNICS?

16:28.258 --> 16:30.460
LOOK, I GET
THAT ELLIE IS DIFFICULT.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.462
I MEAN, SHE CAN BE
DOWNRIGHT NASTY.

16:32.462 --> 16:34.094
ABRASIVE, CONTENTIOUS...

16:34.094 --> 16:35.465
HORRIBLE!
SPITEFUL...

16:35.465 --> 16:37.497
GRIZZLY!
VILE...

16:37.497 --> 16:40.100
SNAKELIKE.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF
DIFFERENT WAYS TO SAY "MEAN."

16:40.100 --> 16:41.471
BUT I DO LOVE HER.

16:41.471 --> 16:43.073
SO YOU'RE JUST SCARED.

16:43.073 --> 16:45.675
WELL, NOT
CAT-WALKING-ON-TWO-LEGS SCARED,

16:45.675 --> 16:48.108
BUT... YEAH.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.409
SHE'S A BITCH.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.041
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.612
WE'RE DONE WITH THAT.

16:52.612 --> 16:56.116
OKAY, YOU NEED TO SAC UP
BEFORE YOU LOSE ELLIE FOREVER.

16:59.049 --> 17:00.290
JULES!

17:00.290 --> 17:02.021
OH! COOL!

17:02.021 --> 17:05.055
IT'S LIKE I WORK
AT TACO BELL. WHAT'S UP?

17:05.055 --> 17:07.026
I JUST WANTED TO SAY,

17:07.026 --> 17:10.230
LOOK AT MY RING,
MY RING, MY RING.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.631
HE PROPOSED!

17:11.631 --> 17:14.234
GET OVER HERE
AND LET ME SEE THAT THING.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.565
AAH!

17:15.565 --> 17:17.367
I'M SORRY I JUST SCREAMED
IN YOUR FACE.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.239
OH, I GET THAT A LOT.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.641
THE NAME'S TOM. I, UH,
LIVE ACROSS THE STREET.

17:21.641 --> 17:25.675
BEFORE YOU SAY WHAT WE'RE
BOTH THINKING, I'M MARRIED.

17:25.675 --> 17:28.078
I'M KINDA DIGGIN' THIS
FLIRTY THING WE GOT GOING,

17:28.078 --> 17:30.820
SORT OF A "WILL THEY
OR WON'T THEY?" VIBE.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.383
(sighs) WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN
WITH THIS.

17:33.383 --> 17:35.385
OKAY, WELL, I'M NOT SURE WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

17:35.385 --> 17:37.087
BUT, UM, NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:37.087 --> 17:38.788
POP IN ANY TIME YOU WANT.

17:38.788 --> 17:41.791
AH, YOU'D LIKE THAT,
DIRTY BIRD.

17:43.093 --> 17:44.434
EW.

17:44.434 --> 17:48.138
(gasps) MY GOODNESS,
THAT ROCK IS HUGE!

17:48.138 --> 17:50.500
MINE'S HALF THE SIZE
AND IT'S FAKE. (chuckles)

17:50.500 --> 17:52.402
I THOUGHT WE COULD FINALLY
DRINK THIS.

17:52.402 --> 17:54.274
DOES THIS MEAN
WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?

17:54.274 --> 17:55.645
WE'RE FRIENDS, AREN'T WE?

17:55.645 --> 17:57.347
(gasps) LET'S GET MATCHING
TOE RINGS.

17:57.347 --> 17:59.809
NOT UNLESS WE'RE FORCED TO
AT GUNPOINT.

17:59.809 --> 18:01.251
HERE.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.653
OKAY.
THANKS.

18:03.653 --> 18:06.116
BRING IT IN.

18:06.116 --> 18:07.357
(sets down bottle)
OH, I DON'T.

18:07.357 --> 18:08.588
OH, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT MY--

18:08.588 --> 18:10.860
UHH!

18:10.860 --> 18:12.422
OHH!

18:12.422 --> 18:14.794
I'M NOT GONNA LET GO
TILL YOU HUG ME.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.426
WOW, YOU'RE ANNOYING.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.368
I KNOW! BUT I'LL ALWAYS
HAVE YOUR BACK.

18:18.368 --> 18:20.500
AND I'M MORE LOYAL
THAN I AM MEAN.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.373
OH. WELL, YOU'RE REAL LOYAL,
AREN'T YOU?

18:23.373 --> 18:25.705
YEAH.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.207
(clink)
CHEERS.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.508
CHEERS.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.109
MM.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.681

18:31.681 --> 18:34.544
(gasps) I NEED
A BIGGER GLASS. MM!

18:34.544 --> 18:36.316
AND WE SIP IT.
MM!

18:36.316 --> 18:37.587
I DON'T. (chuckles)

18:37.587 --> 18:39.819
WOW.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.392
I'M SO GLAD WE FOUND
EACH OTHER.

18:42.392 --> 18:43.723
THE CRACKER AND THE BITCH.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.595
(chuckles)
IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SAID.

18:45.595 --> 18:47.457
OUR PAST IS WHO WE ARE.

18:47.457 --> 18:49.829
WE HAVE TO OWN IT.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.702
(sighs deeply)

18:52.702 --> 18:57.807
(Avalanche City) в™Є IF ONLY LIFE
WOULD LEAN OUR WAY в™Є

18:57.807 --> 18:59.239
GO.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.540
DO I HAVE TO?
YES.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.912
в™Є WE'D RUN AWAY TO BE в™Є

19:02.912 --> 19:06.646
в™Є WHEREVER OUR ADVENTURE WAITS в™Є

19:06.646 --> 19:08.548
SINCE THE DAY WE MET,

19:08.548 --> 19:11.251
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WERE
TOO GOOD FOR ME.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.522
I LOVE YOU.

19:12.522 --> 19:14.424
LAURIE ATE YOUR BURGER,

19:14.424 --> 19:17.357
AND THEN I ORDERED YOU
ANOTHER BURGER,

19:17.357 --> 19:18.728
AND I ATE THAT BURGER.

19:18.728 --> 19:20.190
IT'S OKAY.

19:20.190 --> 19:21.931
в™Є A DISTANT MEMORY в™Є

19:21.931 --> 19:26.796
в™Є NOBODY COULD TELL US TO STAY в™Є

19:30.200 --> 19:32.772
HEY.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.444
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:34.444 --> 19:36.806
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
MY STUFF OUT OF YOUR WAY.

19:36.806 --> 19:39.779
I TELL YOU WHAT.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.252
WHY DON'T WE GO
UNPACK THEM?

19:42.252 --> 19:43.613
REALLY?

19:43.613 --> 19:45.815
YEAH.
I CAN FIND SOME ROOM.

19:45.815 --> 19:48.318
в™Є MY WAY,
I HEARD YOUR HEART... в™Є

19:48.318 --> 19:50.920
HEY, DO YOU EVER WISH WE HAD
A CUTE MAGICAL STORY

19:50.920 --> 19:52.522
ABOUT HOW WE MET?

19:52.522 --> 19:53.763
в™Є I HEARD YOUR HEART SAYING... в™Є

19:53.763 --> 19:54.964
SWEETIE,

19:54.964 --> 19:57.297
I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.530
в™Є I HEARD YOUR HEART SAYING
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE в™Є

20:00.530 --> 20:01.731
OH, GOSH!

20:01.731 --> 20:04.604
OH, I'M SO SORRY!
OH! SORRY.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.935
(gasps) OH, MY GOODNESS!

20:05.935 --> 20:07.837
I JUST--I'VE BEEN
SO SCATTERED LATELY.

20:07.837 --> 20:10.510
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WIN OVER
THIS NEIGHBOR OF MINE,

20:10.510 --> 20:11.911
AND SHE'S
A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED GAL,

20:11.911 --> 20:14.884
AND... (chuckles)
WELL, I'M NOT. SO...

20:14.884 --> 20:16.646
HERE YOU GO.
OH, THANKS.

20:16.646 --> 20:18.548
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:18.548 --> 20:20.890
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS?
IT'S GREAT FOR MAKING FRIENDS.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.952
OKAY. THANKS.

20:22.952 --> 20:24.394
BYE.

20:24.394 --> 20:25.655
(grunts)

20:25.655 --> 20:27.527
в™Є WHOA, OH в™Є

20:27.527 --> 20:30.900
в™Є LOVE, LOVE, LOVE в™Є

20:40.610 --> 20:42.011
TRAVIS?

20:42.011 --> 20:44.414
HI.

20:44.414 --> 20:47.477
(chuckles) I'M SORRY. I'M NOT
SURE HOW WE KNOW EACH OTHER.

20:47.477 --> 20:49.018
IT'S ME. ERIN.

20:49.018 --> 20:50.950
WE WERE
IN SECOND GRADE TOGETHER.

20:51.981 --> 20:54.724
(inhales sharply)

20:54.724 --> 20:55.955
GREAT SEEING YOU, MAN.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.827
YOU, TOO, DUDE.
