00:48.929 --> 00:51.609
Stop! God damn it!

00:53.074 --> 00:55.402
Dumb ass, you pulls up your
crime scene like that you're gonna

00:55.488 --> 00:57.250
contaminate the damn evidence.

01:00.296 --> 01:02.003
Oh my God!

01:05.394 --> 01:06.526
Oh yeah!

01:08.646 --> 01:11.870
Looks like the kid
is ripped ... apart.

01:20.863 --> 01:25.191
It's Casey Gotrea and his daddy.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.942
You know what
did this, don't you?

01:30.943 --> 01:32.872
You don't want to hear
that ignorant shit, Mark.

01:33.117 --> 01:34.977
I mean you and me both of us
know what did this, Sheriff

01:35.478 --> 01:37.619
I'm out .....

01:40.288 --> 01:41.839
When you finished with
what you're doing there,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.772
call the Coroner's office
and get him out here.

01:44.178 --> 01:45.386
I forgot to take, Sheriff.

01:47.428 --> 01:49.273
You still don't believe
how many dead bodies ...

01:49.274 --> 01:50.374
Now!

05:17.090 --> 05:20.546
We're all packed.  Do you want
to know where?  Here we come.

05:21.340 --> 05:24.111
Let's go to my home.
I've got to shower.

05:33.674 --> 05:35.827
- Um Jen.
-Yeah.

05:36.881 --> 05:39.727
I have a little confession to make.

05:42.001 --> 05:44.033
What did you do this time?

05:44.878 --> 05:48.481
Remember when I told you my father's
godson was staying with us for a few weeks?

05:48.844 --> 05:52.117
Yeah, Dave or something ...
you said your dad was like

05:52.219 --> 05:54.647
helping him with career planning stuff.

05:54.648 --> 05:55.748
Right.

05:59.003 --> 06:01.510
I invited him to stay with us at
the cabin for a couple of nights.

06:01.511 --> 06:03.404
But only for a couple of nights.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.064
And then the rest of the
week, it'll just be me and you,

06:05.065 --> 06:06.561
and we'll just hang
and do girl's stuff.

06:06.562 --> 06:08.234
You know.
Have fun.

06:10.440 --> 06:15.260
Maya.
This isn't supposed to be a party.

06:15.561 --> 06:18.866
I know.  And I know I
should have asked you first.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.744
But he really needs some time away.

06:22.308 --> 06:24.267
He's been through some shitty stuff.

06:25.744 --> 06:27.458
He's just as confused as you are,

06:28.259 --> 06:31.029
But he doesn't have a mom
like you, to attend to, you know.

06:31.330 --> 06:33.014
He's pretty lost.

06:33.015 --> 06:36.392
- You think I can talk to my mom.
- Yeah. Why not?

06:36.835 --> 06:40.686
Mom's great, Jen.  I don't
understand why you hate her so much.

06:43.048 --> 06:46.314
Are you mad?
Shit!  You're mad.

06:47.122 --> 06:48.076
Jen.

06:48.827 --> 06:52.199
I'm not mad.
You know I can't be mad at you.

06:53.009 --> 06:55.690
You're going to love him.
He's really cool.

06:55.691 --> 07:00.237
And he's smart like you, not
to mention he's smokin' hot.

07:00.321 --> 07:03.837
Maybe the two of you could,
you know ... hang out.

07:04.526 --> 07:05.961
I don't think so.

07:06.048 --> 07:07.267
Well, he is cute.

07:07.268 --> 07:10.574
If he wasn't in fact my brother,
I'll probably do him.

07:10.775 --> 07:12.809
I'm sure you will, Maya.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.867
- Bitch.
- Slut.

07:16.991 --> 07:20.715
Hey ya, the way I see it ...
it will be good for you.

07:20.716 --> 07:22.565
You've always been such a loner.

07:22.666 --> 07:25.147
Plus, with me going away
to school next month.

07:25.748 --> 07:30.322
Anyway, being around someone besides me
might help draw you out of your funk.

07:32.121 --> 07:36.655
It's only a couple of days.
Cause you are cute.

08:08.986 --> 08:10.347
Who's that girl?

08:11.515 --> 08:13.144
I have no clue.

08:37.876 --> 08:40.667
- Hey sweetie. How you guys doing?
- Okay.

08:40.668 --> 08:43.294
- Guess we beat you here.
- Guess so.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.588
Jen, this is Dave.
Dave, this is Jennifer.

08:46.589 --> 08:49.588
- Hey Jen, how are you doing?
- Good. Okay.

08:49.623 --> 08:51.288
Nice to meet you.

08:52.901 --> 08:55.977
Yeah, and I brought
my friend, Brook.

08:56.925 --> 09:00.165
Who is she?
You never mentioned a girl.

09:00.535 --> 09:04.209
This is the girl I'm seeing.
You won't even know she is here.

09:05.582 --> 09:09.044
- It is okay, right?
- Oh, the more the merrier.

09:09.479 --> 09:12.337
So.
What is there to do around here?

09:13.873 --> 09:17.090
Uhh, there's canoeing,
we can rent a bike.

09:17.896 --> 09:21.140
Skinny dip,
You can bake in the sun.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.369
Just saying it's quicker.
Good work.

09:47.273 --> 09:50.653
Want to do it again?
Ok, to the tree and back.

09:50.851 --> 09:55.951
Okay, on your
mark, get set, go.

09:59.633 --> 10:03.030
Same time if you're tired.  We'll do
more once your breath pick up a bit.

10:04.029 --> 10:06.920
Jen, I have to be going.
You want to come say bye to me?

10:15.394 --> 10:18.754
Troy, just still take
good care of her.

10:20.979 --> 10:22.439
Yes, I will.

10:27.312 --> 10:28.900
I'll be back on Sunday, okay?

10:29.294 --> 10:32.554
I want you to call me every night
before you go to sleep, alright sweetie.

10:33.652 --> 10:34.943
Want to give me a hug?

10:36.390 --> 10:38.689
Jen, why don't you want
to give me a hug?  Come here.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.574
- You won't forget to call?
- No, I won't forget.

10:46.394 --> 10:48.874
- Have fun.
- I will.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.856
Be seeing you.
I love you, okay.

10:56.710 --> 10:58.938
Daddy!

10:59.163 --> 11:00.445
Yeah.  What was that for?

11:00.446 --> 11:02.787
I just missed you.
I just miss you so much.

11:02.788 --> 11:05.370
Oohh. Princess.

11:06.068 --> 11:09.200
Are you there Jen?
Hello.

11:10.054 --> 11:12.797
Jen, you okay?

11:12.798 --> 11:16.985
Oh, I'm great.
I'm not paying attention. Fine.

11:33.361 --> 11:36.092
Excuse me.

11:38.194 --> 11:41.326
- Home sweet home.
- Oh, my God.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.597
Oh, Gods.

11:49.077 --> 11:51.677
It's nice.
Very nice.

11:55.910 --> 11:57.566
Is there a hotel around here?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.918
Don't let the door hit
you in the ass, ok, Hon.

12:06.911 --> 12:08.072
She's kidding, right?

12:08.373 --> 12:12.562
Of course, she is ...duh.
Come on, let's go see the bedrooms.

12:15.456 --> 12:17.353
Let's go, pick out our room.

12:21.703 --> 12:25.029
- That one is a bedrooms?
- Yeah, you guys can have this one.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.375
A twin bed?

12:27.732 --> 12:29.359
I'm sure you guys could figure it out.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.334
Hell, there is always a porch
you can sleep in next.

12:36.535 --> 12:39.375
- It is cool, my gal.
- How?

13:26.218 --> 13:29.040
God, .. please make daddy and mommy

13:30.233 --> 13:33.753
in case I do make up for dad
to come back home again ...

13:33.754 --> 13:34.954
is that ......

13:43.946 --> 13:44.924
Jen.

13:55.567 --> 13:58.024
If we're staying late, maybe we should
go in town and get some supplies.

13:58.225 --> 14:01.030
I'll make a list for you and
Brenda to take to town.

14:01.910 --> 14:04.149
- It's Brook.
- What?

14:04.702 --> 14:08.034
You just called me Brenda,
and my name is Brook.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.119
Hey Maya, why don't
you just go with them.

14:14.503 --> 14:16.343
You know I'm going
to stay here with you?

14:16.887 --> 14:20.088
Actually, I'd rather be
alone with me, myself.

14:21.423 --> 14:24.955
Sure.  I mean, you are
okay being here, right?

14:26.629 --> 14:31.094
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine really, sorry just...

14:31.421 --> 14:33.868
Really, it's cool.

14:35.598 --> 14:40.515
Okay.
All right guys, let's go.

15:07.133 --> 15:10.946
Welcome, all you in.
For whatever you want.

15:24.052 --> 15:26.007
You kids just passing through?

15:26.608 --> 15:29.984
No, we're staying at the
cabin on the lake, for a week.

15:32.516 --> 15:36.182
Ma'am I'm sorry but
there's something in this water.

15:36.183 --> 15:38.126
Oh dear!

15:41.570 --> 15:43.625
There you go, Hon.
All gone.

15:48.072 --> 15:52.825
Our dinner special tonight is fried
catfish, french fries and hash browns.

15:53.075 --> 15:57.924
And your choice of large beverage,
orange soda, iced tea and beer.

15:57.971 --> 16:01.923
Of course, if you all ask for beer,
I'm going have to see what I do.

16:02.324 --> 16:05.259
Um, I guess hush
puppies are like fries.

16:06.436 --> 16:12.379
You aren't from around here, are you?
-No, not even close.

16:13.165 --> 16:17.811
Of course they're fried, honey.
Did you ever hear of baked tush puppies?

16:22.182 --> 16:25.000
- I'll just have a cheeseburger and fries.
- Yeah, me too.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.882
Ahh, make it three
cheeseburgers and fries.

16:30.174 --> 16:32.188
All right.
Coming up.

16:37.301 --> 16:41.697
I mean, is it just me, or just
everyone here seem weird?

16:48.390 --> 16:49.609
No, it's not just you.

16:50.734 --> 16:53.823
Do you think that it's best
that we get out, quietly.

17:15.679 --> 17:17.005
Hello, mum.

17:21.272 --> 17:22.334
Well, we're here

17:26.304 --> 17:27.851
I tried to, but ..here

17:31.166 --> 17:32.599
No, it's dead.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.355
Yeah.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.196
Everything but the phone.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.111
That was supposed to be the idea.

17:51.019 --> 17:53.586
No, you don't.  You want
me to meet you, and I don't.

17:53.649 --> 17:55.544
And I am safe here.

17:57.100 --> 18:00.433
You know what. I have to go.
I'll call you when I get some ......

18:10.858 --> 18:14.853
Hello.
It's okay.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.971
I'm Dustin.  I live in the cabin
next door to where you're staying.

18:20.049 --> 18:23.228
- Well, you scared the shit out of me.
- That's right.

18:45.916 --> 18:50.780
- Sure you don't want anything?
- No thank you.

18:52.629 --> 18:56.630
- You don't seem like a local.
- I'm not.

18:56.632 --> 19:00.812
- You live here now, though.
- For now.

19:04.528 --> 19:07.263
Did you realise you're over
10 miles from town, right?

19:07.764 --> 19:10.618
Yah, I remember that.
We drove here.

19:14.060 --> 19:17.248
You carry that shotgun
with you, everywhere you go?

19:17.447 --> 19:19.613
If you've seen what I've
seen, you'd understand.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.745
And what have you seen?

19:28.139 --> 19:29.359
Long story.

19:30.815 --> 19:33.504
Well, I got time.
I'm gonna be here all week.

19:38.674 --> 19:41.078
I brought my wife Kay
out here, about a year ago.

20:20.258 --> 20:22.436
Dustin...

20:27.139 --> 20:29.345
That was the last time I saw her.

20:35.492 --> 20:36.947
Oh God.

20:38.686 --> 20:40.199
That's horrible.

20:43.378 --> 20:48.778
- Did they ever catch him?
- And it wasn't a man that took her.

20:49.371 --> 20:53.287
Well, if it wasn't a human,
then what was it?

20:55.878 --> 20:59.376
Your dad ...
never tell you about this place?

20:59.457 --> 21:03.541
You mean like, any other
American folklore, right?

21:05.689 --> 21:07.141
If you want to call it that.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.392
Well, I mean,
I read up on some of it

21:11.393 --> 21:13.889
when as was trying to
find out more about the place.

21:22.687 --> 21:24.521
You believe in all that, don't you?

21:25.338 --> 21:31.533
Like I said before Jeniffer,
this place isn't safe.

21:39.354 --> 21:44.537
I am really sorry about
what happened to your wife.

21:45.927 --> 21:47.286
I really am.

21:50.579 --> 21:54.510
Don't you think
... I don't know ...

21:54.804 --> 21:59.805
it's the kind of stuff that people make up
in small towns, cut through the bottom ..

22:00.306 --> 22:03.167
monsters and stuff.

22:04.110 --> 22:05.863
Let me put it to you like this.

22:07.264 --> 22:12.905
For about 30 years, people
in this town, pets, wild animals

22:12.906 --> 22:14.553
have been mutilated in these woods.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.905
That's your pattern.

22:21.318 --> 22:24.812
It seems that he mutilates
and kills the males and

22:26.216 --> 22:29.226
females, it seems he abducts.

22:33.022 --> 22:36.678
Every abduction, every
murder has gone unsolved ..

22:37.911 --> 22:39.378
And believe this.

22:40.414 --> 22:44.120
They will continue to go unsolved,
as long as it is still out there.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.863
But why just abduct the females?

22:49.744 --> 22:51.718
The creature is very human like us.

22:53.756 --> 22:57.781
Anatomy is very similar
to that of a male human.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.785
Very similar.

23:03.715 --> 23:08.166
Close enough that it can
breed with the human female.

23:14.228 --> 23:15.219
So yer

23:16.051 --> 23:19.771
maybe this small town
folks could do even this.

23:23.216 --> 23:26.341
But no one's gonna
do anything about that.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.450
There's something in these woods ...

23:31.826 --> 23:34.442
that's pure evil.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.027
How do you even want to say that.

23:39.157 --> 23:44.013
All I'm trying to say is ...
maybe you should leave, Jennifer.

23:58.714 --> 24:03.874
Okay, it's official.  Boggy Creek
is a 10.0 on a Creepy Scale.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.521
This place is weird.

24:18.269 --> 24:21.926
That Dustin guy sounds just as weird
as those freaks we saw in town today.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.707
Who isn't weird, Bud?

24:25.265 --> 24:28.113
He does think there's
something out there in the woods.

24:28.114 --> 24:30.969
Oooohh.
Is he hot?

24:31.876 --> 24:33.221
What?

24:33.422 --> 24:36.008
This mysterious cabin guy, Dustin.

24:36.343 --> 24:39.917
I don't know, I have no idea.

24:39.918 --> 24:40.821
He is.

24:42.425 --> 24:45.539
I knew it.  Oh, Jen.
You have a crush.

24:45.540 --> 24:47.522
He's okay.
He's so, so.

24:47.723 --> 24:49.212
You should hook up with him.

24:49.491 --> 24:52.633
If that ... guys I will march
right out there and do that.

24:52.634 --> 24:54.130
What?
You my pimp?

24:55.350 --> 24:59.297
Jen, I just want you to have some fun.
You know ... smile more.

25:02.429 --> 25:04.125
Alright, you guys
brought the tent, right?

25:04.126 --> 25:05.226
Mmm hmm.

25:05.227 --> 25:05.905
Excellent.

25:05.906 --> 25:09.395
Look, I got a portable stove,
propane, matches. I got everything.

25:09.396 --> 25:10.521
So I think we're good.

25:10.846 --> 25:13.739
You guys aren't going to be all scared
and shit out on the woods, will you.

25:14.427 --> 25:17.129
- Please
- I'm just saying, you know ...

25:18.065 --> 25:19.773
I don't want to be
the one doing all the work.

25:19.774 --> 25:21.737
We do for an all rough
and rough a bit, right?

25:21.838 --> 25:23.445
I like it scared.

25:23.746 --> 25:26.448
But if were up to me,
I would just stay here,

25:26.449 --> 25:31.003
where there is running water,
bath, nice comfortable bed.

25:42.867 --> 25:46.609
How could driving be so
damn tiring. I'm exhausted.

25:46.710 --> 25:47.976
I hear that.

25:49.094 --> 25:54.342
Well, you'll sleep like a baby tonight.
It is so peaceful out here.

26:37.022 --> 26:38.198
You've got to be kidding me.

26:40.046 --> 26:42.883
You guys mind?
We're trying to sleep in here.

26:47.898 --> 26:54.627
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, nothing. Just writing.

26:58.941 --> 27:01.012
So is it sad being here?

27:02.616 --> 27:05.891
Ummm ... yeah.

27:07.349 --> 27:08.617
But it's a good sign.

27:10.053 --> 27:11.454
Good sign?

27:12.584 --> 27:19.381
Yeah like ... I don't know.
I missed him so much and

27:19.882 --> 27:23.537
while I'm here eventhough
he is not here anymore

27:23.691 --> 27:28.386
I feel like I'm more near him
than I have been in along time...

27:31.126 --> 27:34.464
like that I could ever be.
I don't know.  It's weird.

27:40.286 --> 27:43.069
Surrounded by his stuff.

27:47.522 --> 27:49.014
I feel like I'm home.

27:51.392 --> 27:53.300
Isn't that crazy?

28:00.542 --> 28:02.289
I feel a little crazy,
do you know?

28:03.332 --> 28:05.118
You're not crazy.

28:05.519 --> 28:10.882
You know Jen, I kind of envy
what you have with your dad.

28:12.452 --> 28:19.329
I mean, I know he died and all, but
you guys were really connected.

28:21.045 --> 28:26.591
That's something I never will
and never have with my parents.

28:29.545 --> 28:33.772
We're just, we're just so different.

28:36.991 --> 28:38.057
Yeah.

28:39.353 --> 28:42.633
You know.
In a way you're lucky.

28:47.287 --> 28:48.775
Yeah.  Maybe.

28:52.456 --> 28:57.217
You know, I don't know how your rotten
parents got such a wonderful daughter.

28:57.843 --> 29:01.506
- They are crazy.
- I know, that's why I have you.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.282
That's right.
You know that's true.

29:04.470 --> 29:06.920
- I love you, girl.
-I love you too, Maya.

29:08.102 --> 29:10.061
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Of course.

29:10.062 --> 29:13.429
- Even if you had to bring a circus.
- I'm sorry.

29:15.180 --> 29:17.599
It'll get better, I promise.

29:17.459 --> 29:19.415
You always got to bring a party with you ....

29:19.416 --> 29:24.023
I know right. Hey it's all your ....
Good night.

29:24.224 --> 29:25.161
Good night.

30:13.685 --> 30:15.043
Were you just in the woods?

30:15.844 --> 30:19.546
I don't want you in the woods, ever.
You understand me young lady?

30:19.547 --> 30:21.800
Cause the woods are
very dangerous, sweetie.

30:22.501 --> 30:24.337
No one should go in there.

30:25.506 --> 30:28.562
It's best you don't
... don't go.

30:36.038 --> 30:37.935
- What's wrong?
- I just ... I thought ...

30:37.928 --> 30:39.996
I thought I heard something.
I guess ...

30:40.397 --> 30:44.665
- You didn't hear anything?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

30:48.566 --> 30:50.306
Well, I'll just go back to sleep.

30:57.653 --> 30:59.709
Yah ... Just look at their faces.

31:00.110 --> 31:03.255
That was like "Aaahh, Aaahh"

31:03.274 --> 31:05.474
That was a shitty
thing to do, Tommy.

31:06.599 --> 31:12.169
Oh, come on, man.  Hey, we're
on vaca... Remember?  Chill!

31:12.257 --> 31:15.616
Now look, if everything is okay,
we will go back to bed.

31:15.679 --> 31:19.828
Yah, everything's fine. My boyfriend
just has a sick sense of humour.

31:20.029 --> 31:22.754
He is a bit challenged in
the maturity department.

31:24.791 --> 31:29.773
Come on, hey. What?
Oh, come on babe.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.788
Look, it was just a joke,
all right.   That's all it was.

31:34.616 --> 31:36.053
You all, two just make the ...

31:36.054 --> 31:39.091
have some fun, and loosen up
a little bit man, for real.

31:40.440 --> 31:45.073
But you should have seen your faces,
Blehhh, Aaahhh.

31:46.945 --> 31:49.814
Behave!
I'll be right back.

31:54.422 --> 31:59.296
I'm just getting started.  What I need
to do is just live a little bit. That's all.

32:01.515 --> 32:02.405
Come on.

32:02.897 --> 32:04.229
Life's too short.

32:12.344 --> 32:15.648
Jen. I am so sorry he did that.

32:15.649 --> 32:17.489
Why, oh, why is he even here?

32:17.842 --> 32:20.689
I wasn't sure he'd come,
or else I would have told you.

32:21.099 --> 32:23.893
He had a job just a couple of hours
away, and is off work tomorrow,

32:23.894 --> 32:25.461
so he want to come and hang out.

32:25.707 --> 32:28.775
But I promise, he's
gone by Monday morning.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.939
Cross my heart. Hope to die.
Stick a needle in my eye.

32:34.863 --> 32:35.882
Sorry.

32:37.608 --> 32:41.492
Just don't wake me with
anymore of your surprises, Maya.

32:43.249 --> 32:46.418
Okay.
Good night.

33:44.547 --> 33:45.777
Hello?

33:47.818 --> 33:51.518
- Somebody there?
- Who is it?

33:54.491 --> 33:56.004
If I could see somebody out there,

33:56.005 --> 33:57.846
you think I'll be asking if
there's anybody out there.

33:57.847 --> 33:58.979
Don't talk to me like that.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.591
- Like what?
- Like an asshole.

34:28.032 --> 34:30.069
Baby...

36:37.926 --> 36:39.946
You know, I didn't
realize that my fantasy

36:39.947 --> 36:42.568
of sleeping with 2 beautiful
women will end up like this.

36:43.478 --> 36:44.613
Shit...

36:45.314 --> 36:47.738
I mean that floor
is hard as hell.

36:49.372 --> 36:50.447
Where's  Jennifer?

36:50.948 --> 36:54.367
She's probably out running.
She does it every morning.

37:04.200 --> 37:09.566
Doesn't she know that leaving
us alone like this is dangerous?

37:11.594 --> 37:12.831
Whatever.

37:13.068 --> 37:14.448
Come here, girl.

37:47.825 --> 37:52.582
Klein, call the coroner.
Tell him you got another one.

37:54.021 --> 37:58.110
When you're done, just get your
pussy ass over here and help me.

38:22.655 --> 38:25.016
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.
Get in.

38:25.017 --> 38:26.221
Hey, hey.
Stop playing.

38:26.222 --> 38:27.894
I'm not getting in there.
Look at it.

38:27.895 --> 38:29.693
Look at all the green
stuff floating around.

38:30.065 --> 38:31.832
Like fish poop or something.

38:32.133 --> 38:33.852
Far as I know it
can be some green,

38:33.853 --> 38:36.281
flesh eating bacterial
disease or something like that.

38:36.516 --> 38:40.210
Like you even know what bacteria is.
It's just dousy, dumb-ass.

38:40.237 --> 38:41.222
Come on.
Jump in.

38:41.266 --> 38:44.200
No, I don't look like I'll ... You can
chill black ass ...You gonna jump.

38:44.350 --> 38:47.938
- Fine Tommy. ...get even worse.
- Whatever.

38:51.019 --> 38:52.736
Well, I guess I better
just get it over with.

38:52.737 --> 38:53.837
Get it over with.

38:54.838 --> 38:56.211
I can't do it.

38:56.212 --> 38:58.509
I can't. I told you ...
It's nasty, huh.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.067
Yeah ....
Could not do it.

39:06.245 --> 39:07.695
Watch out.

39:08.315 --> 39:09.710
Do you mind?
What's up, baby?

39:09.816 --> 39:11.467
Morning
-Morning

39:11.468 --> 39:12.477
What you guy's doing, man.

39:12.773 --> 39:15.469
Oh, she thought she was about to
get me in that nasty ass water, man.

39:15.470 --> 39:16.821
No, she didn't get it neither, though.

39:16.822 --> 39:17.922
No, it was .....

39:18.021 --> 39:21.529
No, we are not at the beach, guys.
I'm not getting in.

39:21.530 --> 39:24.317
Hey, so did she tell to you about that
interesting experience at the diner?

39:24.352 --> 39:27.575
- Yah, yah.
- She told me that. That was classic.

39:27.990 --> 39:31.361
Yeah, oh my God.
The people in this town are so spooky.

39:31.362 --> 39:33.988
I mean, we walk in the diner,
from the moment we walked in,

39:33.989 --> 39:35.984
they just stared at
us, the whole time.

39:35.985 --> 39:36.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:36.901 --> 39:38.459
And this old guy
was on the porch,

39:38.460 --> 39:42.054
I expected him to take out his banjo
and just go to work when we walked out.

41:03.516 --> 41:05.778
Hey, I can't do this anymore, Troy.

41:06.906 --> 41:08.545
I can't be doing this.

41:08.546 --> 41:12.733
Remember I said
I got to discuss my .....

41:14.594 --> 41:16.654
You made that painfully obvious, girl.

41:17.670 --> 41:23.983
Well, I'm done. I'm finished and
mean at this time, I'm going back.

41:27.012 --> 41:28.656
Do you have anything to say?

41:34.530 --> 41:35.962
Well, goodbye baby.

41:48.042 --> 41:50.750
So Jen is pretty bent out of shape
about us being here, huh?

41:50.751 --> 41:52.011
No, she's fine.

41:52.695 --> 41:54.098
She doesn't seem fine.

41:54.685 --> 41:58.568
Well, it's kind of my fault.
I kind of put her on the spot.

41:58.753 --> 42:01.365
She's just really been a mess
after her father dying and all,

42:01.366 --> 42:03.513
and I didn't realize she
wanted to be here alone.

42:04.108 --> 42:05.929
Now look.
Jen is a sweet girl.

42:05.930 --> 42:08.443
She's just got a lot of things
she's gonna do right now, that's all.

42:08.544 --> 42:09.839
She'll be all right.

42:09.850 --> 42:11.224
Well, maybe but ...

42:11.025 --> 42:14.057
I'm sorry. That doesn't give
you the excuse to be just so bad.

42:14.058 --> 42:17.351
Hey! Watch it girl.  That's my
best friend you're talking about.

42:18.785 --> 42:19.875
Now you know what?

42:19.876 --> 42:24.026
I actually think it's great that she's
actually around people, you know.

42:24.227 --> 42:27.409
I mean, being alone by yourself,
being a hermit like that.

42:27.410 --> 42:29.530
That can't be good for nobody.

42:30.774 --> 42:32.794
What happened to her dad, anyway?

42:35.884 --> 42:39.695
He was found on the side of the
highway up there. In his running clothes.

42:42.330 --> 42:46.343
They think it was a hit-and-run.
Some sort of large vehicle.

42:48.209 --> 42:52.445
When they found him,
he was almost unrecognizable.

42:53.387 --> 42:55.194
Shit, that's awful.

42:55.760 --> 42:59.966
I've heard worse.  I mean,
at least he didn't suffer, right?

43:02.395 --> 43:03.437
What?

43:03.638 --> 43:06.183
All I meant was that
some people suffered.

43:06.184 --> 43:09.743
He was lucky in like
a weird sort of way.

43:19.631 --> 43:22.328
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:26.942 --> 43:29.026
So you all want to take
the boat out or something?

44:41.773 --> 44:44.957
I'm so hungry.
I'll go make sandwiches.

44:45.058 --> 44:46.796
You know,
actually I'll go with you.

44:46.797 --> 44:49.370
No, no.  Stay here.
It'll only take me a few minutes.

44:52.695 --> 44:54.079
All right.

44:56.678 --> 44:59.131
- I got you.
- Only landing bush.

44:59.713 --> 45:02.331
- Here you go.
- Now, work Buddy.

45:12.440 --> 45:15.617
- Hey.
- So what are you writing about?

45:17.002 --> 45:20.517
- Nothing.
- Nothing, huh.

45:21.615 --> 45:23.935
Hey look, I'm sorry for
imposing by being out here.

45:23.936 --> 45:25.334
It's okay.

45:29.478 --> 45:32.122
- It's a great place.
- Yeah, I like it.

45:35.366 --> 45:38.402
Dave .. can you come
here for a second?

45:38.403 --> 45:40.078
Just hold on.
Give me a minute.

45:42.949 --> 45:46.341
- So how long did your dad live out here?
- 11 years.

45:48.235 --> 45:50.964
And this is the first time
that I've been back in a while.

45:51.798 --> 45:54.447
- Aren't you guys in a fight or something?
- No.

45:56.713 --> 46:02.701
No fight.  My dad he just
had some issues with people.

46:03.949 --> 46:07.954
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

46:08.387 --> 46:09.470
Dave.

46:10.971 --> 46:14.110
Can you put some
sunscreen on my back?

46:15.000 --> 46:16.420
Oh, damn.

46:26.678 --> 46:28.041
Don't leave me out here.

46:33.733 --> 46:35.824
Nolan, what the hell!
My car!

46:36.770 --> 46:38.648
Don't act like you didn't do that.

46:44.847 --> 46:46.529
How the hell did you
get that on the car?

46:47.043 --> 46:51.660
Dude, why in the heat hell, would
I drive all the way out here

46:51.661 --> 46:54.302
from butt fucked Egypt,
to decapitate piggy

46:54.303 --> 46:57.561
and then sit around and just look
this nasty ass shit on my car, huh?

46:57.562 --> 46:59.050
Why would I do
something like that, Dave?

46:59.485 --> 47:00.892
We should call the cops.

47:01.719 --> 47:04.519
- There are cops around here, right?
-No.

47:05.746 --> 47:07.905
Right.  Just hold off
on calling the cops.

47:07.906 --> 47:09.852
You two try not
to kill each other.

47:09.903 --> 47:13.363
- I'm going to handle this.
I'll be right back.
- Wait. Jen, where are you going?

47:14.064 --> 47:15.581
We'll be right back.

47:16.779 --> 47:19.878
- I'm not the only one to
be digging this grave.
- You gotta to digging that.

47:19.879 --> 47:21.473
You're gonna be
helping to dig this, too.

47:25.392 --> 47:26.845
Shut up, white boy!

47:39.574 --> 47:41.937
Dustin, it's Jennifer from next door.

47:43.482 --> 47:45.679
If you're in there,
please open up.

47:52.091 --> 47:53.458
I'm not in there.

47:54.734 --> 47:57.377
Someone threw a mutilated hog
on the hood of my friend's car,

47:57.378 --> 47:59.085
and I want to know if it was you.

47:59.486 --> 48:00.743
It wasn't me.

48:02.643 --> 48:04.597
By the way, I'm Maya.

48:06.811 --> 48:09.922
So wait. We're suppose to just
believe that it magically appeared there.

48:10.123 --> 48:12.844
I don't care what you believe.
I told you I didn't do it.

48:14.095 --> 48:16.988
Look, you're in a swamp
surrounded by deep woods,

48:16.989 --> 48:18.506
there are dead
animals everywhere.

48:18.807 --> 48:23.022
Just like I told you last night,
there's something out there.

48:23.423 --> 48:25.715
It's been mutilating
animals for years,

48:26.475 --> 48:31.234
even worse,
sometimes it mutilates people ...

48:31.635 --> 48:35.647
who happen to be in the
wrong place, at the wrong time.

48:36.199 --> 48:41.224
Aw come on, you're not talking
about the bigfoot.  Shit .. again.

48:45.129 --> 48:48.674
I'm really sorry about
what happened to your wife,

48:49.170 --> 48:50.754
and I think that you know that.

48:52.218 --> 48:54.384
But I'm not going to be scared off.

48:55.626 --> 49:01.919
My father, he left me that cabin and
I intend to stay there as long as I want.

49:02.583 --> 49:06.361
Hey look, if you're so convinced
that there is something out here.

49:06.362 --> 49:07.726
Why are you here?

49:17.079 --> 49:21.434
Did you here anything about
these girls getting out of here?

49:26.928 --> 49:30.073
Well. Was that supposed to
be a threat or something?  Huh.

49:30.615 --> 49:32.011
You two, chill.

49:32.303 --> 49:33.911
You I'm just saying,
he's got a gun.

49:33.912 --> 49:35.722
Well I just saying, if he
was a threat or something,

49:35.723 --> 49:37.597
then maybe we should do
something about it, you know.

49:37.619 --> 49:38.895
Well, that's just great!

49:38.896 --> 49:43.997
We've got dead pigs, man with a gun,
Bigfoot.  You 2 morons, in your car.

49:47.517 --> 49:50.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:54.525 --> 49:57.733
Damn. Well, that's done with.

50:00.549 --> 50:05.826
- I love Texas thunderstorms.
- Yeah, me too.

50:06.388 --> 50:09.091
I love it, like, just like this
white one I saw at the pool.

50:11.697 --> 50:12.817
Where's Brook?

50:13.318 --> 50:16.938
She had to sleep for a little bit.
Said she feels nauseous.

50:17.762 --> 50:19.186
She's pregnant.

50:21.849 --> 50:23.237
She got an IV.

50:29.025 --> 50:31.687
- So what was that all about earlier.
- What do you mean?

50:31.705 --> 50:33.421
The conversation
with your neighbour.

50:33.722 --> 50:37.268
Think he's the one that
threw the pig on Tommy's car?

50:37.588 --> 50:39.796
I think he really doesn't
want us to be here

50:40.306 --> 50:43.461
and it make sense
that it would be him.

50:43.583 --> 50:47.336
Right, Tommy's afraid of aussie,
I don't see him killing a pig,

50:47.337 --> 50:49.230
dragging it through the woods.
You know what I mean?

50:49.276 --> 50:50.476
I guess you're right.

50:50.477 --> 50:54.578
Like if it's him, our neighbour and us out
here. You know what I'm saying like ...

50:54.979 --> 50:56.353
Yah, I think it's him.

50:57.576 --> 51:01.695
What do you think about this whole
Bigfoot thing? Do you think that's real?

51:03.150 --> 51:04.832
Where are you offing toward that?

51:07.453 --> 51:12.520
I have never been one for fantasy.
No.

51:13.984 --> 51:19.369
Even if I was, I would be a lot more
terrified with some psychotic human being,

51:19.370 --> 51:22.484
like, going after
people with a machete.

51:22.519 --> 51:26.892
You know what I mean, like
not some big scary ape, please.

51:43.666 --> 51:44.874
Hit!

51:45.675 --> 51:47.045
What the hell!
What you doing?

51:47.049 --> 51:48.825
Babe, do this.
Come here and do it.

51:48.826 --> 51:52.432
Let me show you how you do it.
Watch the man how he did...

51:55.749 --> 51:58.139
Ahh, you suck.
Let me show you.

51:58.140 --> 52:00.625
No, no, no.  I was going to do that
...in high school though.

52:00.694 --> 52:03.847
- Where's Dave?
- He's out on the porch with Jennifer.

52:12.265 --> 52:13.358
Dave!

52:14.635 --> 52:16.455
Can you come inside?
I'm scared.

52:17.279 --> 52:18.471
One second.

52:23.070 --> 52:25.199
No. Now.

52:25.502 --> 52:27.406
Look. Just give me a minute.

52:27.736 --> 52:30.924
You know ....
getting a little sick of this shit.

52:32.340 --> 52:35.028
- What shit?
- You two flirting.

52:35.415 --> 52:36.578
What the hell!

52:41.562 --> 52:46.325
I get it.  Do you want to
bang her or something?

52:47.047 --> 52:50.252
Do you Dave?
Huh?

53:13.540 --> 53:14.576
What?

53:15.177 --> 53:18.944
Nothing man. Nothing
at all.  I'm just saying.

53:20.547 --> 53:21.795
Hey, you know what?

53:23.093 --> 53:28.303
Why don't you come on over here
by our side. Come here. Come on girl.

53:34.561 --> 53:38.070
Alright.
Let me help you out.

53:40.174 --> 53:41.238
Fine, sorts.

53:44.911 --> 53:47.063
That's a double for ...
you drink it kind of real slow.

53:49.281 --> 53:50.406
That's done it.

53:55.455 --> 53:58.939
Can you help her,
I got something for you ...

54:07.861 --> 54:10.843
I just ...
You know what ...just

54:16.830 --> 54:21.340
You guys are so great.
I love you so much.

54:34.186 --> 54:35.302
It's good.

54:41.548 --> 54:43.467
Maybe I'd better ...

54:44.868 --> 54:46.970
That's fine.
I'll catch you later.

55:04.570 --> 55:09.041
What exactly do you find
so interesting about her?

55:09.581 --> 55:11.021
What?

55:11.340 --> 55:14.641
- I see the way you look at her.
- What are you talking about, Brook?

55:14.991 --> 55:18.591
I can get any guy I want,
and I chose to be with you.

55:18.592 --> 55:20.531
So don't pull
this shit on me now.

55:20.532 --> 55:22.495
- Anyone?
- Yeah, anyone.

55:22.594 --> 55:25.303
Okay, then be with anyone.

55:35.032 --> 55:36.265
Thanks, bitch.

55:44.676 --> 55:47.757
Hey, maybe you can
hook up with Dave now.

55:54.904 --> 55:58.206
- Guys, I'm sorry.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

55:58.627 --> 56:01.728
Hey, you you not going to ...
chase your girl, man?

56:01.729 --> 56:05.757
No, that's what she expects me to do.
She's not going anywhere.

56:05.758 --> 56:08.627
She's just a little bit
high maintenance, huh?

56:08.628 --> 56:10.250
Uh, no. She thinks...

56:10.251 --> 56:11.988
Yeah, a little.

56:13.449 --> 56:15.508
So how many drinks did
you make for her, anyway?

56:15.663 --> 56:17.504
Oh, I only gave
her two of mine.

56:18.966 --> 56:19.718
Don't.

56:23.094 --> 56:26.191
- Then she took the whole bottle.
- Oh, shit.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.347
Alright, time I boo-boo.
I know.

56:34.266 --> 56:37.458
I'm pretty tired, lady.

56:41.192 --> 56:43.296
I hear you all.
I'm exhausted myself.

56:45.409 --> 56:47.907
You know, you all can actually
take the bed if you want.

56:47.908 --> 56:49.866
No, Jen. It's alright.

56:49.867 --> 56:51.105
No, seriously.
It's fine.

56:51.139 --> 56:53.691
I don't even have the
energy to get off this couch.

56:54.107 --> 56:55.140
So go right ahead.

56:56.016 --> 56:57.372
Yeah, you sure about that?

56:57.373 --> 57:00.434
I'm sure.
You have to change the sheets.

57:02.007 --> 57:03.261
Thanks, girl.

57:05.020 --> 57:06.263
Sorry about the mess.

57:19.221 --> 57:21.051
Are you sure you don't
want to go after her?

57:21.052 --> 57:26.205
No, she's done this before.
Trust me.

57:26.506 --> 57:28.697
She'll be back once she calms down.

57:29.168 --> 57:30.396
Fucking asshole.

57:31.089 --> 57:32.649
Should have never come
here with him anyway.

57:32.650 --> 57:34.333
I mean, who does
he think he is, right?

57:34.534 --> 57:36.036
What a prick.

57:43.804 --> 57:44.511
Hello?

57:46.855 --> 57:47.976
Hello?

57:51.220 --> 57:55.051
Where am I?
Please, just me.

57:55.752 --> 57:56.775
Shit!

58:39.652 --> 58:40.946
Jesus Christ!

58:41.047 --> 58:45.247
Thanks for looking for me, asshole.
I could have been killed out there.

58:59.120 --> 59:01.287
...tried to pull this crap on me.

59:15.806 --> 59:20.082
... fucking asshole. You think you
can get back at me. I don't think so.

59:34.456 --> 59:35.694
Shit!

59:40.241 --> 59:41.226
Somebody's there.

59:43.690 --> 59:45.531
..enough of this car being shit!

59:48.826 --> 59:51.648
Bloody Jen.
I can't take this lying down.

59:51.949 --> 59:53.138
Jones!

01:00:26.913 --> 01:00:29.857
Good morning, sunshine.
How are you?

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:32.913
Damn.
Do you have to be so loud?

01:00:34.976 --> 01:00:35.896
Sorry.

01:00:35.897 --> 01:00:36.818
I got this.
I got it.

01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:42.602
Hey also.
Where's your girl, man?

01:00:43.803 --> 01:00:45.102
I don't know.

01:00:45.103 --> 01:00:47.282
She up yet?
Is she coming, or?

01:00:47.783 --> 01:00:50.188
You see, dude.
She jacked my truck last night.

01:00:50.389 --> 01:00:51.822
Went to some motel.

01:00:52.423 --> 01:00:54.105
Yeah, stupid.

01:00:54.106 --> 01:00:57.255
I guess the way she was acting, she felt,
hey I don't want to show my face again.

01:00:57.256 --> 01:00:58.134
Whatever.

01:00:58.235 --> 01:01:00.031
I'm gonna check on
her tomorrow afternoon.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:03.547
Okay guys,
I got the waters.  Here.

01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:09.875
Hey, bro.
Are these yours?

01:01:12.358 --> 01:01:14.684
Yah, alright man.
Very funny

01:03:26.647 --> 01:03:29.275
Why so much food?  You'd think we
won't be coming back or something.

01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:31.093
Well, that's because
my girl's on her ass.

01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:34.190
You see, when she is on a rag
like that, she gets very hungry.

01:03:34.191 --> 01:03:36.833
- Ah, asshole.
- I'm just saying it.

01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:41.801
Did you know that it's not such a good
idea to be out in the woods with a bleeder.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:43.925
- What?
- Yeah.

01:03:44.526 --> 01:03:45.488
Why?

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.223
It just, attracts the wild animals, they can
smell the blood from miles away.

01:03:52.471 --> 01:03:53.214
Haaa!

01:05:03.693 --> 01:05:06.107
Aw, what's wrong man.
Does this make you miss your girl?

01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:12.101
Well, hell no, man. As soon as we
get back, it's over. That was a mistake.

01:05:12.102 --> 01:05:16.406
Really. So what do you think she is
doing all alone by herself in the hotel?

01:05:16.507 --> 01:05:20.226
Probably sticking little needles in a
Voodoo doll that looks just like me.

01:05:22.772 --> 01:05:26.001
Wow.  This is
lovers lane, huh, Jen?

01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:31.273
You know what. Your dad can
definitely pick up till midnight..

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:08.170
Listen. I'm going to finish up.
So as I was saying.

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:11.750
So tell us like, this guy
with a hockey mask on, right.

01:06:11.863 --> 01:06:15.112
He comes over to the cabin,
he just starts, going at him,

01:06:15.113 --> 01:06:17.315
and slashing this guy,
just picking him up

01:06:17.316 --> 01:06:19.998
and put him in the back pack
and store him just to choose him,

01:06:19.999 --> 01:06:20.906
everything like that.

01:06:22.207 --> 01:06:23.799
Dude, we heard that one before.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.688
Fine, why, you got a
better one you can tell?

01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:32.867
Campfire stories are lame.

01:06:34.051 --> 01:06:36.931
Well, this sucks right, man, whatever.
You got one better?

01:06:38.973 --> 01:06:41.650
- Okay, baby.
- Thank you.

01:06:42.511 --> 01:06:46.145
So when you get back, how long
are you going to be staying in .....?

01:06:46.648 --> 01:06:51.089
Well, actually, that was
supposed to be a surprise.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:52.739
What surprise?

01:06:53.873 --> 01:06:57.268
In two weeks,
I'm off to boot camp.

01:06:57.669 --> 01:07:01.330
- Are you serious?
- Yup. Time to cut the hair.

01:07:02.046 --> 01:07:03.188
Does my dad know?

01:07:04.089 --> 01:07:05.967
He's actually the one that got me in.

01:07:05.968 --> 01:07:08.511
Now, we don't want to say
anything till we knew for sure.

01:07:09.578 --> 01:07:12.468
But I didn't think
I had a chance till now.

01:07:13.835 --> 01:07:17.766
If I play my cards right, in a few
years, I can apply to become an officer.

01:07:18.533 --> 01:07:21.473
Maybe fly helicopters or shit.
How cool would that be?

01:07:21.553 --> 01:07:22.722
That'll be cool man.

01:07:23.446 --> 01:07:26.511
Oh, that's great Dave.
I'm so glad of you.

01:07:26.512 --> 01:07:27.612
Thanks.

01:07:27.613 --> 01:07:28.675
Well, congratulations.

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:31.589
Thanks.

01:07:34.443 --> 01:07:38.615
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
We got a long hike tomorrow.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.123
Yeah, me too.
I'm getting pretty sleepy.

01:07:42.134 --> 01:07:44.130
All right.
I'll put out the fire.

01:07:51.159 --> 01:07:53.827
- You having fun.
- I am.

01:07:54.893 --> 01:07:59.468
- You forgive now for inviting Davies?
- I guess I have to ...

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:04.535
I'm glad Tommy and Dave
were here .... not so much Brook.

01:08:05.036 --> 01:08:06.939
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.206
I'm so happy she didn't come. That
girl has a couple of screws loose.

01:08:13.207 --> 01:08:14.717
Are you girls decent?

01:08:14.831 --> 01:08:17.846
Aren't you suppose to ask that
question before you poke your head in?

01:08:17.848 --> 01:08:18.747
No, what would be the fun in that?

01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:23.233
- Hey, where's Tommy?
- Using the boy's room.

01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:28.071
So, where is it going to sleep?

01:08:29.734 --> 01:08:33.368
Well I'm here, and the 2
lovebirds are over there,

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.303
and you are here.

01:08:36.104 --> 01:08:36.962
Cool.

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:42.685
Ten kids. Hey what you
think my battles are doing?

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:45.292
Ten.
Maybe one or two, but ten, no.

01:08:48.429 --> 01:08:49.269
Hello?

01:08:51.337 --> 01:08:53.203
Come on man,
this shit ain't funny.

01:08:54.957 --> 01:08:56.479
What the hell is going on?

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:57.636
I'm tripping man.

01:08:57.638 --> 01:08:59.682
It's probably some small ...  animal.

01:09:00.276 --> 01:09:02.712
A teenie tiny, squirrel, aren't you?

01:09:07.308 --> 01:09:08.688
Come on, Tommy man.

01:09:10.765 --> 01:09:13.560
Oh me, a grown man from Texas.
Get it together.

01:09:30.193 --> 01:09:33.225
Alright, Okay, I'm scared okay.
You win.

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:39.859
Hey guys, Tommy's
been gone for a while.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.873
I'm going to go see if I could
find him.   I'll be right back.

01:10:45.231 --> 01:10:46.313
Tommy!

01:10:52.316 --> 01:10:53.016
Tommy!

01:11:03.647 --> 01:11:07.072
Tommy, if this is another
one of your jokes, stop now.

01:11:07.073 --> 01:11:08.674
I'm not in the mood.

01:11:10.717 --> 01:11:12.830
Tommy, I mean it, stop.

01:11:21.643 --> 01:11:26.279
Hey guys. He's not answering.
I'm getting really worried.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:31.261
I'm sure his fine, Maya. It's probably
just another one of his jokey jokes.

01:11:31.868 --> 01:11:36.378
And look, we're camping in
this farm under the full moon,

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.963
this is perfect material for him.

01:11:38.416 --> 01:11:43.209
Yeah, he's right. He's fine.  Just
lay down. He'll be here in a second.

01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:47.251
Yeah, you're right.
He surprises being a critic.

01:11:54.508 --> 01:11:55.991
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.145
Sorry.

01:12:04.429 --> 01:12:06.268
I don't know why you apologized?

01:12:06.969 --> 01:12:12.113
If it was up to me,
I'd be sleeping right here.

01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:30.266
Hey, I'm really worried.

01:12:30.267 --> 01:12:32.587
Something just
doesn't feel right.

01:12:34.237 --> 01:12:36.333
I'm going to see if
I could find him again.

01:12:36.334 --> 01:12:38.117
No.., I got him.

01:12:39.179 --> 01:12:43.429
I'll find him. Probably
constipating or something.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.871
Tommy!

01:12:53.489 --> 01:12:56.470
Come on Tommy, enough
is enough already, man.

01:13:00.704 --> 01:13:02.299
You gonna make
me come find you.

01:13:05.539 --> 01:13:07.225
That's a long shit, Tommy.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.287
I just wish sometimes he'll grow
the hell up. You know what I mean?

01:13:13.235 --> 01:13:19.099
Tommy is Tommy. He is always
been this way. You always love him.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.529
Love him, yes. But love
him right now? Hell no.

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:29.243
Tommy, come on, man.
This is stupid.

01:13:31.902 --> 01:13:33.085
I hate you, Tom.

01:13:40.242 --> 01:13:41.170
Tommy!

01:14:00.986 --> 01:14:04.406
Tommy! Tommy!
Fuck!

01:14:21.561 --> 01:14:22.873
What was that?
Was it Dave?

01:14:23.674 --> 01:14:25.814
He's been gone now for 20 minutes.

01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:27.914
I'm gonna see him.

01:14:27.915 --> 01:14:32.321
No. You're not leaving me in
here alone. I'm not going out there.

01:14:32.355 --> 01:14:37.699
Well seriously, I'm sure
that everything is fine, I mean,

01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:41.398
Tommy probably just talked Dave into
one of his little pranks or something.

01:14:41.499 --> 01:14:45.709
No. Something is wrong, Jen.
Very, very wrong.

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:50.537
- I'm scared.
- Okay, just take a deep breath.

01:14:51.238 --> 01:14:55.247
And, I'm sure everything gonna be fine.

01:14:55.748 --> 01:14:59.327
And I'll go out there and I'll
check and I'll be right back.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:04.274
I know. It's no.
Don't go out there. Please.

01:15:06.864 --> 01:15:08.224
What are you doing?

01:15:08.225 --> 01:15:13.030
Looking for something to use as a weapon.
Shit, we don't have anything.

01:15:16.983 --> 01:15:18.282
What is that?

01:15:19.192 --> 01:15:20.411
Shhh.

01:15:22.853 --> 01:15:26.251
- Oh my God!
- Shhhh.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:31.055
Don't move, ......

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:35.805
What do you mean?

01:15:38.563 --> 01:15:43.385
I think it's a bear.
We have to stay quite still.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.194
After a while it
would just go away ...

01:15:46.913 --> 01:15:49.918
Well, it came looking
for me, remember?

01:15:55.313 --> 01:15:56.960
Oh my God!
I'm scared.

01:15:57.348 --> 01:16:00.678
Shhhh..
You gotta stay quiet.

01:16:02.221 --> 01:16:04.836
Okay.
Shhhh.

01:16:48.394 --> 01:16:52.118
Where the hell is the boat?
Where's the boat?

01:16:56.451 --> 01:16:57.667
Maya, run.

01:16:58.898 --> 01:17:00.062
Run!

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.209
Tommy!

01:17:48.415 --> 01:17:51.234
Maya, we have to go now.
We can't stay here.

01:17:51.235 --> 01:17:52.965
No, I can't leave.

01:17:56.133 --> 01:17:58.637
I know.  Listen to me,
you can't help him now.

01:17:59.238 --> 01:18:03.128
We can't help him now. We have to go.
We have to save ourselves.

01:18:05.158 --> 01:18:07.565
No, I can't.

01:18:08.055 --> 01:18:11.417
I'll help you away.
We can't stay here.

01:18:35.672 --> 01:18:40.708
Listen .. I need you to stay here.

01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:42.924
Whatever happens, you're
gonna be safe here, okay.

01:18:42.925 --> 01:18:45.170
We have to fix this ....

01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:48.260
Maya, look at me.

01:18:48.903 --> 01:18:49.804
Trust me.

01:19:38.961 --> 01:19:42.653
Come on Jen!
Help! No, no....

01:19:43.836 --> 01:19:46.879
Listen, listen to me.
You can't help her now.

01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:50.169
You gotta run to the highway.

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:54.792
Listen. Damn it.
Jen, you run!

01:19:55.927 --> 01:19:58.420
Now.
Get moving.

01:20:38.603 --> 01:20:41.974
Come on...
Come on ...

01:20:43.518 --> 01:20:45.462
I need help, I need
you to call somebody.

01:20:45.463 --> 01:20:48.085
I need help. Something ...
Something is chasing me.

01:20:49.587 --> 01:20:50.486
Mom?

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:52.952
Mom.

01:21:03.602 --> 01:21:08.138
Come on. Come on...
No...
