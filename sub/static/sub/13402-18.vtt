00:02.500 --> 00:04.718
Mona knows about the game.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.658
She know the answer before
you even ask the quest/on.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.395
(Spencer)
Okay, we don ’t need
your theories.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.793
I guess you're forgetting
who replaced the shattered

00:09.840 --> 00:11.398
windshield once you peeled
Dunhill off of it.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.668
You still want this,
don't you?

00:12.710 --> 00:14.462
- I want it back.
- 'Then you'll get it.'

00:14.510 --> 00:17.707
'But first you need to deliver a
gift to Spencer and her family.‘

00:17.750 --> 00:19.377
- What is going on?
- How did she get in here?

00:19.410 --> 00:22.072
(Linda)
I could pin a lot on you.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.815
Can I kiss you?

00:23.850 --> 00:25.511
I wanna be a family.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.142
I want to marry your daughter,
Mrs. Marin.

00:27.190 --> 00:28.657
We have something to toast.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.214
Earlier tonight
the Rad/ey bar was ﬂooded

00:30.260 --> 00:31.318
destroying a//
the receiots stored.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.452
Security cams went dark during

00:32.490 --> 00:34.458
the exact ten minutes we needed.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.060
We'll just have to broaden
the scope of my investigation.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.590
- Of a flood?
- Of a homicide.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.495
- What happened?
- Someone knocked me down.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.692
[instrumental music]

00:47.180 --> 00:49.569
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.518
Sorry for all the tossing
and turning last night.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.784
Considering what's going on
in our lives right now

01:00.820 --> 01:03.311
it's amazing neither one of us
can get any sleep.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.156
You're so beautiful
In the morning.

01:20.310 --> 01:22.778
You know, just because
you had a bad night

01:22.810 --> 01:25.199
. doesn't mean _
we cant have a good morning.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.341

01:34.390 --> 01:36.756
When did you move that in here?

01:36.790 --> 01:38.121
I didn't.

01:41.630 --> 01:43.757
(Emily)
Here's your puzzle piece.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.897
How?

01:46.940 --> 01:49.989
Someone's been in here.
Might still be in here.

Check those drawers.

02:05.350 --> 02:07.443
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:07.490 --> 02:08.889
I may need you to stay here.

02:10.290 --> 02:12.520
- Hello?
- Are the police there?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.152
- Yeah.
- 'They're here, too.‘

02:14.200 --> 02:15.394
They had Spencer sprung first.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.022
She called me
and then I called Aria.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.992
Ma'am, I'm gonna
need your phone.

02:19.030 --> 02:20.725

'Check this stuff, too.‘

02:42.820 --> 02:44.310
Come in here.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.127
You need to check these bureaus.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.299
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:53.100 --> 02:55.398
I need to speak
to Detective Furey now.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.159
(Linda)
'Detective Furey is
no longer on this case.‘

02:59.140 --> 03:01.176
I'm in charge now.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.701
Got a secret_
can you keep It?

03:06.750 --> 03:09.469
Swear this one you'll save

03:09.520 --> 03:11.886
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:11.920 --> 03:14.548
Taking this one
to the grave

03:14.590 --> 03:17.115
If I show you
then I know you

03:17.160 --> 03:19.549
Won't tell what I said

03:19.590 --> 03:22.354
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:22.400 --> 03:24.618
If one of them is dead

03:26.640 --> 03:29.529
I can tell you're surprised
by Detective Furey's absence.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.765
No, it just seemed sudden,
that's all.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.459
Did it?

03:33.510 --> 03:35.432
My understanding is,
he was a good cop

03:35.480 --> 03:38.677
but that
here in Rosewood, he seemed..

03:38.710 --> 03:40.473
...distracted.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.944
Does that seem like
a fair characterization?

03:43.990 --> 03:45.639
I really couldn't say.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.788
Nothing in your relationship
led you to believe

03:48.820 --> 03:51.516
that he was conflicted
in his approach

03:51.560 --> 03:53.983
to solving the murder
of Archer Dunhill?

03:54.030 --> 03:55.349
No.

03:59.930 --> 04:02.535
Furey told me everything,
Miss Hastings.

04:05.340 --> 04:08.639
From bar stools,
to ping pong

04:08.680 --> 04:12.172
right before he took himself
off the case.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.349
[dramatic music]

04:15.480 --> 04:19.610
I'm giving you a chance
to tell the truth.

04:22.420 --> 04:23.751
Oh, but I guess..

04:23.790 --> 04:25.257
[sighs]

04:25.290 --> 04:27.884
...old habits die hard.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.854
I am impressed by
how well you played him.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.595
But then again,
I remember how adept

04:32.630 --> 04:34.769
you and your friends are
at that sort of thing.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.429
- That's not fair.
- Oh, fairness. It's overrated.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.165
Truth is what counts.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.768
[music continues]

04:43.780 --> 04:46.749
Well, I would say that
it's good to see you

04:46.780 --> 04:49.908
but under these circumstances..

04:49.950 --> 04:51.815
You should know something.

04:52.890 --> 04:53.845
I'm a closer.

04:53.890 --> 04:57.087
I_asked to
have this investigation.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.258
I am going to get to the bottom
of what happened to Dunhill

05:00.300 --> 05:02.951
and how you and your friends
are involved.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.589
I've always felt
that you were guilty

05:07.640 --> 05:09.767
in some way, I just..

05:10.640 --> 05:12.665
...never knew how.

05:14.410 --> 05:16.571
Now, I think
I'm gonna find out.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.578
[music continues]

05:22.650 --> 05:25.380
Wait. So, where exactly
is the list that says

05:25.420 --> 05:27.012
what you can and cannot seize?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.652
Seriously, who do I talk to
about this?

05:28.690 --> 05:31.682
Call the station,
but just not on this.

05:33.630 --> 05:36.326
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

to be without'

06:16.740 --> 06:18.901
'especially now that
you're on my team.‘

06:20.540 --> 06:22.804
- It's not enough.
- 'What's not enough?‘

06:22.840 --> 06:24.137
The phone.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.799
I wanna meet you.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.875
'Well, I'm not sure
if that's wise.‘

06:28.920 --> 06:31.844
Neither am I,
but time's running out.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.312
Cops just left.

06:33.350 --> 06:34.908
Who knows what they'll find.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.111
I have done
everything you asked me.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.254
You said it yourself. I-I-I've
earned my way on your team.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.495
You owe me.

06:43.530 --> 06:47.125
'Tonight, I'll text you
the details.‘

Hey, are you alright?

07:12.260 --> 07:14.023
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.891
My childhood teddy bear
is now in jail

07:15.930 --> 07:17.852
with my phone
and my favorite pillow, but..

07:17.900 --> 07:20.027
- Hanna?
- I'm fine.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.935
The police seem to think
that you're all involved

07:21.970 --> 07:24.530
in disappearance
of that imposter Alison Merrit.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.037
Is that true?

07:27.340 --> 07:28.978
- Detective Furey--
- Mom.

07:29.010 --> 07:31.638
Just tell me.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.102
I have never seen you
like this.

07:33.150 --> 07:35.209
What're you talking about?
I'm always trying to help you.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.139
Yeah, but you're never so quick
to think that I need it.

07:38.190 --> 07:40.750
Okay. Do you need it?

07:43.060 --> 07:44.049
Yes.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.058
[music continues]

07:48.960 --> 07:52.020
But I'm not gonna let you
give it to me.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.321
What? Why?

07:53.370 --> 07:57.067
Mom, you've spent
your whole life helping me.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.634
Doing things
you shouldn't have had to do.

07:58.670 --> 08:01.503
Because I love you.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.201
And now it's time
for me to show you

08:03.240 --> 08:06.243
how much I love you by not
letting you get involved.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.508
[door opens]

08:10.550 --> 08:12.347
Hey, did your mom find you?

08:12.390 --> 08:13.584
I could have
climbed through a window

08:13.620 --> 08:14.882
and she would have found me.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.649
Hey, she gave us a room
to hang out in

08:16.690 --> 08:18.351
until we can go back
to our houses.

08:18.390 --> 08:19.618
Yeah, I know.

08:19.660 --> 08:20.752
Probably thought I'd feel bad

08:20.800 --> 08:22.756
about getting a free suite.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.324
The world's upside down.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.429
Speaking of which

08:26.470 --> 08:27.664
I got us all these

08:27.700 --> 08:30.237
until we get
our real phones back.

08:30.270 --> 08:32.465
This makes me _ _
really want to go to jail.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.535
What're we doing
to stay out of jail?

08:34.580 --> 08:36.229
- Has anyone heard from Aria?
- No.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.599
'Cause she doesn't have
one of these.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.777
Okay, guys, I know
we all woke up early

08:39.810 --> 08:41.949
and we're cranky,
but let's stay focused.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.517
'I'm as freaked out
as the rest of you.‘

08:44.550 --> 08:46.245
Maybe even more,
considering it looks like

08:46.290 --> 08:48.815
A.D. was watching Ali
and me sleep last night.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.788
[instrumental music]

08:52.830 --> 08:54.229
Wait, so are you two..

08:56.660 --> 08:58.992
Well, about time.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.035
So, I've been thinking.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.799
The game has to connect
to the Internet

09:03.840 --> 09:05.330
and it does that
with an IP address

09:05.370 --> 09:06.701
which is like a phone number.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.264
I'm writing a program
right now to search

09:08.310 --> 09:09.868
the cell towers in Rosewood.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.242
When the game connects, I might
be able to find his location.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.976
No wonder they call you
"Too genius, too furious."

09:16.680 --> 09:18.113
No one calls me that.

09:18.150 --> 09:19.344
[all chuckle]

09:19.390 --> 09:20.880
Wait, we ordered food?

09:20.920 --> 09:23.559
Yeah, before we realized
that none of us was hungry.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.482
Oh, my God.

09:26.530 --> 09:29.556
[dramatic music]

09:33.530 --> 09:35.395
Is that the same one
from the game?

09:35.440 --> 09:36.896
I think so.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.233
"Just one plea,
the rest go free.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.874
If no one steps up,
you all go down."

09:46.910 --> 09:49.310
(Spencer)
'1 don't understand.‘

09:49.350 --> 09:51.568
[beeping]

09:51.620 --> 09:54.544
He wants us to choose
one of us to go to jail.

09:54.590 --> 09:55.614
Or we all go.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.412
[door opens]

09:57.460 --> 10:01.385
If you want an explanation,
you might try asking Aria.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.591
Why would we ask Aria?

10:03.630 --> 10:06.269
I think she's on the AD. team.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.222
[music continues]

10:14.340 --> 10:15.739
Explain.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.375
Well..

10:22.650 --> 10:25.744
'First there's the whole
locker 214 fiasco.‘

10:25.790 --> 10:27.109
Aria said she couldn't make it
to the high school

10:27.160 --> 10:28.787
to see who picked up
the hard drive.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.788
That's because she was at
the pubIICIty event with Ezra.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.357
Which she did not actually
attend, so where was she?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.890
'The trashing
of your nursery happened'

10:35.930 --> 10:38.057
'at the exact same time.‘

10:38.100 --> 10:40.819
Spencer, were any of us
sitting in this room right now

10:40.870 --> 10:42.189
near your house
when that recording

10:42.240 --> 10:44.094
of Mary Drake and your father
was played?

10:44.140 --> 10:46.131
How do you know about that?

10:46.170 --> 10:48.001
[dramatic music]

10:49.410 --> 10:50.809
No.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.100
But Aria was.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.073
Okay, guys, come on.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.940
Aria would never do
something like that.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.879
I saw her get a puzzle piece
in the brew.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.117
It was hidden for her
and she knew where to find it.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.355
'I also managed
to access a portion'

11:07.400 --> 11:10.358
of an unsettling phone call
Aria had today.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.697
With who?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.469
A.D.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.161
[music continues]

11:16.200 --> 11:17.758
(Aria on recording)
'I've earned my way
on your team.‘

11:17.810 --> 11:19.107
'You owe me.‘

11:19.140 --> 11:21.677
(AD)
'Tonight, I'll text you
the details.‘

11:23.140 --> 11:24.471
I'm not happy about this.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.807
Whether you choose
to believe me or not--

11:25.850 --> 11:27.147
Concrete proof.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.343
Just remember

11:31.390 --> 11:32.846
you asked for it.

11:32.890 --> 11:36.018
[beeping]

11:39.030 --> 11:40.429
Well, search warrants
were served

11:40.460 --> 11:43.327
on multiple locations
this morning.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.760
No, ma'am, I can't tell you
exactly when

11:45.800 --> 11:47.324
but from what I've seen so far

11:47.370 --> 11:48.792
it does indicate
that we should be able

11:48.840 --> 11:50.990
to file charges
within a week.

11:52.610 --> 11:55.067
I will. Thank you.

11:55.110 --> 11:56.475
- Lieutenant Tanner.
- Yeah?

11:56.510 --> 11:58.444
- You need to see this.
- Okay.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.649
Hm. Where'd you find it?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.147
'Shower drain.‘

12:03.180 --> 12:04.772
'There are traces of blood
in there, too.‘

[dramatic music]

12:06.050 --> 12:07.142
Hm.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.655
Good work.

12:09.690 --> 12:11.885
[indistinct pop music]

12:14.400 --> 12:15.355
'Spencer.‘

12:16.700 --> 12:18.258
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.460
Oh, my God.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.367
What're you doing here?
Did something happen?

12:22.400 --> 12:25.437
Tanner happened. She called me
in for questioning.

12:25.470 --> 12:27.768
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:27.810 --> 12:31.177
- Um, how are you doing?
- Um..

12:31.210 --> 12:34.668
- I haven't seen you since..
- Yeah.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.574
Thank you.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.247
Some good days, some bad.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.281
I'm, uh,
I'm hanging in there.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.911
How are you,
how are you holding up?

12:43.960 --> 12:46.326
Just feels like there's..

12:46.360 --> 12:49.796
There's so much noise
that's coming from everywhere.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.058
Mm-hmm.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.091
But you know
that's why I love

12:53.130 --> 12:55.064
being out at the cabin.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.092
You couldn't find a_ noise
out there if you tired.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.335
You could join me
if you'd like.

13:00.370 --> 13:01.871
[music continues]

13:03.850 --> 13:06.375
So, um...Tanner..

13:06.410 --> 13:08.878
Uh..
Yeah, no, I, I tried to

13:08.920 --> 13:10.808
get a picture
of what she was doing

13:10.850 --> 13:12.613
who she was talking to.

13:12.650 --> 13:14.311
And?

13:14.360 --> 13:15.486
[sighs]

13:15.520 --> 13:19.286
It, it seems like
she's building a solid case.

13:19.330 --> 13:22.822
That she didn't share a lot,
but she was acting..

13:22.860 --> 13:24.157
...encouraged.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.739
Should I be worried?

13:29.770 --> 13:32.466
Did you have anything to do
with Dunhill's murder?

13:32.510 --> 13:34.569
[dramatic music]

13:35.580 --> 13:38.231
[sighs]
I have to go.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.303
Where?

13:43.320 --> 13:45.584
It's probably better
if you don't know.

13:45.620 --> 13:48.487
[instrumental music]

13:52.960 --> 13:56.748
Aria? W-what's goin' on?

13:56.800 --> 13:58.199
Nothing.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.022
[cell phone ringing]

14:02.070 --> 14:04.095
You should probably get that.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.202
Hey, yeah.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.607
Wes. What's goin' on?
Look, can..

What are you doin' out here?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.397
I was, I was trying to meet A.D.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.335
Oh, my God.
Mona was right.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.689
Mona? What has Mona have to do--

15:10.740 --> 15:12.037
Were you in our nursery?

15:12.070 --> 15:14.538
Did you put the recording
in Spencer's house?

15:14.580 --> 15:15.899
'I mean, did A.D.
ask you to do this'

15:15.940 --> 15:17.032
_ and in return _
give you a puzzle piece?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.274
I can explain.

15:18.310 --> 15:19.948
Aria, we literally
caught you black-hooded.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.119
Why would you do this
for AD?

15:26.550 --> 15:28.347
Do you remember when we
found out Ezra was writing

15:28.390 --> 15:32.258
a book about Alison
and hid it from us, from me?

15:32.290 --> 15:34.087
[sighs]

15:34.130 --> 15:35.722
I did something
to get back at him.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.749
What?

15:36.800 --> 15:38.051
I filled out a police report

15:38.100 --> 15:39.362
that was accusing him of

15:39.400 --> 15:40.924
trying to take advantage of me.

15:40.970 --> 15:43.188
I never filed it,
but somehow A.D. got it

15:43.240 --> 15:45.060
and threatened to turn it in.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.668
Ezra would have gone to jail.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.063
So, what?

15:48.110 --> 15:50.738
It was just a no—brainer
of you to pick Ezra over us?

15:50.780 --> 15:52.338
Guys, I didn't know what to do.

15:52.380 --> 15:54.143
(Emily)
'You could have talked
to us. Okay?‘

15:54.180 --> 15:56.944
We're friends, since forever.
That's what we do.

15:56.980 --> 15:58.538
[cell phone ringing]

16:00.020 --> 16:01.419
Hello.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.984
Do you know anything
about "Choose or loose"

16:03.020 --> 16:04.317
or the timer?

16:04.360 --> 16:06.954
- No. What are you--
- The game, Aria!

16:06.990 --> 16:08.059
[dramatic music]

16:08.100 --> 16:09.988
A.D. never mentioned
any of that.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.554
You really have been
talking to AD.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.160
Spence, AD. or A
has been forcing us

16:14.200 --> 16:15.599
to make terrible choices.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.062
Do you remember Malcolm?

16:17.100 --> 16:19.159
You kidnapped Ezra's kid
to get to Toby.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.269
I didn't end up
hurting anybody.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.778
Because of you, my parents
are getting a divorce.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.643
You have ruined everything
that I ever had.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.240
[instrumental music]

16:29.950 --> 16:31.269
'We're done.‘

16:33.120 --> 16:34.747
We're done and I'm out.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.009
- 'Spencer--'
- Don't try to change my mind.

16:38.060 --> 16:40.756
I'm not trying to.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.358
That was Tanner.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.527
She wants us_to come down
to the police station.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.127
You, too.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.635
You can find your own ride.

16:51.670 --> 16:54.605
[dramatic music]

17:21.070 --> 17:22.594
Thank you for joining me.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.699
I thought it might be
helpful to discuss

17:24.740 --> 17:27.300
all of the evidence
that our department has gathered

17:27.340 --> 17:28.466
'into the investigation'

17:28.510 --> 17:31.138
'of the murder
of Mr. Archer Dunhill.‘

17:33.510 --> 17:34.875
Piece of glass was retrieved

17:34.920 --> 17:37.969
from Ms. Hasting's
shower drain this morning.

17:38.020 --> 17:39.840
'A windshield fragment.‘

17:39.890 --> 17:42.757
Interesting, since the car
belonging to an acquaintance

17:42.790 --> 17:44.587
of yours, Lucas Gottesman

17:44.630 --> 17:47.827
recently had its
windshield replaced.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.499
Lots of cars get their
windshields replaced.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.328
But the piece of glass
in question also matches

17:53.370 --> 17:55.167
a fragment found
under the fingernails

17:55.200 --> 17:57.339
'of the deceased, Mr. Dunhill.‘

17:58.470 --> 17:59.801
'We're also analyzing'

17:59.840 --> 18:02.331
'your search history
in your computers.‘

18:02.380 --> 18:04.109
Honestly, it surprises me

18:04.150 --> 18:05.947
just how few people
take advantage

18:05.980 --> 18:07.902
of the privacy settings.

18:07.950 --> 18:10.441
- What else?
- Excuse me?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.243
What else do you have?

18:12.290 --> 18:15.282
There's a quite a bit
of Radley Hotel video

18:15.320 --> 18:17.550
from the night
Mr. Dunhill disappeared.

18:17.590 --> 18:22.186
Did you know that they even
have a camera in the elevator?

18:22.230 --> 18:25.256
We get it.
There's lots of evidence.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.722
'And there's probably
more to come.‘

18:26.770 --> 18:30.069
But the question is,
why are you telling us this?

18:30.100 --> 18:31.567
Ithought

18:31.610 --> 18:33.760
it was obvious.

18:33.810 --> 18:37.075
I am giving you a chance
to tell your side of the story

18:37.110 --> 18:40.307
before my side
becomes the only side.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.739
You were the one who rescued
us five years ago.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.372
That's because you wouldn't
tell me the truth

18:44.420 --> 18:47.844
and you ended up
in an underground bunker.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.211
So why don't you
let me help you now?

18:53.690 --> 18:55.499
Are we done here?

18:58.800 --> 19:01.769
For now. Mm-hmm.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.768
[dramatic music]

19:03.800 --> 19:05.495
You're free to go home.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.599
Hope you get
a good night's sleep.

- I disappointed you?

19:32.170 --> 19:34.821
(AD)
'I agreed to meet you,
but you weren't careful.‘

19:34.870 --> 19:36.292
'And look what happened.‘

19:36.340 --> 19:38.661
'I don't like sloppiness
on my team.‘

19:38.710 --> 19:41.531
Yeah, I don't like
being lied to.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.673
You were never gonna
meet me, were you?

19:43.710 --> 19:45.769
You just wanted
to blow my cover

19:45.810 --> 19:47.368
and blow up
all of our lives.

19:47.410 --> 19:48.900
Well, congratulations,
you did it.

19:48.950 --> 19:51.612
- You must be really proud.
- 'Aria--'

19:51.650 --> 19:53.117
You got me
to turn against almost

19:53.150 --> 19:54.708
every single person
that I love.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.819
And all I have to show for it
is the cop's on my ass.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.555
I've done everything
you asked me to do.

19:58.590 --> 20:01.024
- You've given me nothing.
- 'I gave you the file.'

20:01.060 --> 20:02.823

- Why?

is another day.‘

you've ever said.

we've been through

is about to go to jail?

20:38.500 --> 20:41.162
This time around,
it is kinda special.

I mean..

20:42.940 --> 20:44.737
...we did kill a guy.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.500
Did anyone notice
anything different

20:48.540 --> 20:50.076
about Mona this morning?

20:50.110 --> 20:53.876
She's Mona. Different's
in her job description.

20:53.910 --> 20:55.400
Yeah, I guess.

At least, he's consistent.

21:09.060 --> 21:12.052
Yeah, well, there's no way
that's gonna happen.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.397
Maybe there is.

21:13.430 --> 21:15.728
I was driving.

21:15.770 --> 21:17.362
I'm the one who killed him.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.992
If I turn myself in,
then you guys are safe.

21:19.040 --> 21:23.033
No. I'm the person
who should turn themselves in.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.707
IfI hadn't have used
the wrong credit card

21:24.750 --> 21:26.399
at this bar, then we would all
be in the clear.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.372
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't married

21:28.420 --> 21:29.614
whatever his name was.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.709
You guys, see what's
happening here, right?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.741
I mean, this is why
A.D's torturing us.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.746
This is exactly what
they wanted all along.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.189

21:37.220 --> 21:38.710
I mean, they already
succeeded with Aria.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.978
Whether we pushed her out
or she did herself

21:41.030 --> 21:42.122
she's gone.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.798
Aria definitely
did it to herself.

21:43.830 --> 21:46.492
Okay, but if A.D. hadn't
gotten Aria to do what she did

21:46.530 --> 21:48.589
they'd have found a way to force
another one of us, too.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.961
I mean, you should know that
better than anyone else.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.467
Meaning what?

21:52.510 --> 21:55.308
Meaning that AD. convinced you
to play the game first.

22:01.850 --> 22:03.317
Where are you going?

22:04.620 --> 22:06.747
I have some thinking to do.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.451
I guess we all do.

22:11.490 --> 22:14.584
[beeping]

22:17.060 --> 22:19.494
[instrumental music]

22:26.110 --> 22:27.338
Caleb.

22:27.370 --> 22:30.134
- Yeah.
- 'Can we talk?‘

22:30.180 --> 22:31.374
Always.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.513
I need to know
what's going on With Hanna.

22:37.550 --> 22:39.438
You know, don't you?

22:41.120 --> 22:43.054
[sighs]
If Hanna doesn't
want you to know--

22:43.090 --> 22:45.115
I know this is about
the death of Dunhill.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.228
Is Hanna covering for someone?

22:49.260 --> 22:51.455
- Actually--
- Is it Alison?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.695
She's always at the bottom
of everything.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.867
Is that who
Hanna's covering for?

22:59.170 --> 23:01.559
(Hanna)
I cannot he/ie ve
that you told my mom.

23:01.610 --> 23:02.736
It's called the truth.

23:02.780 --> 23:03.929
I think it's something,
we all need

23:03.980 --> 23:05.333
to become a little
more familiar with.

23:05.380 --> 23:07.848
Hmm. Yeah, easy for you to say.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.087
Hey.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.018
We're in this together.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.823
That's why I told your mom.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.589
Are you really gonna
try and weasel

23:22.630 --> 23:24.655
your way out of this
by saying you love me?

23:24.700 --> 23:27.760
- Well, will it work?
- It might.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.567
I love you.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.973
Damn, you're good.

23:41.010 --> 23:43.046
[instrumental music]

23:43.080 --> 23:44.877
Alright, break time's over.

23:47.490 --> 23:50.516
Are you any closer
to finding the game?

23:50.560 --> 23:51.686
Well, there is no close.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.083
I either find the location

23:53.130 --> 23:54.358
or I've got nothing.

23:54.390 --> 23:56.722
So far, nothing.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.869
Do you remember when these
used to be our phones?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.266
Like, a million years ago?

24:05.310 --> 24:08.529
[exhales]
There was so much less
to worry about.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.538
[music continues]

24:11.580 --> 24:14.708
I'm really sorry that
I involved you in this mess.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.275
Which mess, in particular?

24:17.320 --> 24:19.117
All of it.

24:19.150 --> 24:20.185
[sighs]

24:20.220 --> 24:21.619
May be we should have
never told you

24:21.660 --> 24:24.083
about the night
that Dunhill died, and..

24:24.120 --> 24:25.382
...I shouldn't
have asked you help me

24:25.430 --> 24:27.819
trash his credit card receipts.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.525
But you did.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.663
64”?)
Spencer, what are you
doing here?

24:36.700 --> 24:38.668
(Spencer)
I found this in the barn.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.701
And it made me think.

24:46.380 --> 24:48.575
Spencer, I'm so sorry.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.108
I know you are.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.948
And I wish that I could
forgive you, but..

24:54.860 --> 24:56.714
...I might have misjudged you.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.785
Tell me what I need to do.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.788
- Please.
- Nothing.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.422
Not now.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.189
You've done enough.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.861
But what you said
last night about me

25:10.900 --> 25:13.107
taking Malcolm,
you were right.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.501
None of us is blameless.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.277
So I do want to say
that I'm sorry..

25:20.310 --> 25:21.277
[knocking on door]

25:25.220 --> 25:27.017
[instrumental music]

25:29.720 --> 25:31.984
[indistinct radio chatter]

25:32.030 --> 25:33.156
What's going on?

25:33.190 --> 25:35.988
Your friend's getting
her belongings back.

25:36.030 --> 25:37.952
- What?
- Why?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.128
I just received proof
that you were not in Rosewood

25:41.170 --> 25:43.491
on the night
that Dunhill disappeared.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.633
A red-light cam
caught you full—frontal

25:45.670 --> 25:47.399
in Keene, New Hampshire.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.135
Now, that is more
than 300 miles away.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.330
I do not know what you
were doing in New Hampshire

25:51.380 --> 25:53.974
but I guess that's none
of my business anymore.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.977
Too bad you're not
as lucky as your friend.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.388
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.559
[dramatic music]

26:04.890 --> 26:06.050
Spence..

26:08.760 --> 26:10.091
[exhales deeply]

26:12.270 --> 26:13.294
[exhales]

26:13.330 --> 26:14.797
What's going on?

26:18.070 --> 26:19.435
We need to talk.

26:19.470 --> 26:22.598
[dramatic music]

26:27.610 --> 26:30.511
What are you trying
to tell me?

26:30.550 --> 26:32.074
I'm trying to tell you
I knew about it.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.088
- You knew about the file?
- Yeah.

26:34.120 --> 26:37.089
And I figured that's what
you're shredding.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.509
After the cops left,
I took the shredder bag

26:39.560 --> 26:41.289
and I dumped it
in the composter

26:41.330 --> 26:43.195
just to be on the safe side.

26:43.230 --> 26:46.028
How did you know?

26:46.070 --> 26:47.526
The other night,
after you fell asleep

26:47.570 --> 26:49.868
I...found it--

26:49.900 --> 26:52.892
I'm so sorry. I was so angry
when I wrote that.

26:52.940 --> 26:55.602
I know. And, and you should
have been angry.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.973
The...the book
I was writing about Alison

26:59.010 --> 27:02.207
where we met,
and-and I started..

27:02.250 --> 27:04.343
I started this relationship
by lying to you.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.541
I wouldn't have blamed you
if you had turned in

27:06.590 --> 27:08.319
that file then or now.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.543
I would have deserved it.

27:09.590 --> 27:12.889
- And maybe I still do.
- No.

27:12.930 --> 27:14.955
No, you do not.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.321
Okay? I was scared.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.657
[music continues]

27:18.700 --> 27:20.463
[sighs]

27:20.500 --> 27:22.923
And I've done some..

27:22.970 --> 27:25.336
...really terrible things
to you

27:25.370 --> 27:26.530
and everyone else.

27:26.570 --> 27:27.559
You don't need to tell me that.

27:27.610 --> 27:30.078
Yes, I do!

27:30.110 --> 27:32.908
I do. I have to tell you
everything.

27:34.610 --> 27:36.840
But I need
to do one thing first

27:36.880 --> 27:38.745
because I'm not sure
you'll still be here

27:38.790 --> 27:40.246
when I'm done.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.917
Okay. What's..

27:45.490 --> 27:47.378
[music continues]

27:57.800 --> 28:00.030
What exactly are we doing here?

28:06.280 --> 28:07.304
I hate you.

28:07.350 --> 28:08.374
[chuckles]

28:08.420 --> 28:09.773
I know.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.411
I even got these.

28:14.250 --> 28:17.879
Someday, maybe we
can afford nicer ones.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.820
Maybe a nicer wedding.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.487
No, it's perfect.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.953
I just thought, with everything
going on right now

28:24.000 --> 28:27.197
we should do this
while we still can.

28:27.230 --> 28:28.822
Plus, um..

28:28.870 --> 28:30.132
You know, if we're married

28:30.170 --> 28:32.730
we, we can't testify
against each other.

28:32.770 --> 28:34.761
Oh, so it's a twofer.

28:37.580 --> 28:39.377
Are you down?

28:39.410 --> 28:40.741
Absolutely.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.173
[instrumental music]

28:50.860 --> 28:53.078
So, what are we supposed to do
until tomorrow morning

28:53.130 --> 28:55.485
when Callie Johnson,
justice of the peace

28:55.530 --> 28:56.656
comes to work?

28:56.700 --> 28:57.689
[Ashley sighs]

28:57.730 --> 28:59.721
Glad I'm not too late.

29:00.430 --> 29:02.193
How did you know?

29:02.240 --> 29:03.764
Caleb told me.

29:04.570 --> 29:07.038
He told me a lot of things.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.100
- Like what?
- The truth.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.207
Most of which
I am not happy about.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.309
And tomorrow it's gonna be
all hands on deck.

29:17.350 --> 29:18.715
I've already got
a call into a new lawyer

29:18.750 --> 29:20.081
and I..

29:23.190 --> 29:24.851
But tonight..

29:24.890 --> 29:26.721
...I'm just gonna be happy
that you have found a man

29:26.760 --> 29:28.284
who loves you
and wants to protect you.

29:28.330 --> 29:31.197
And I can't wait for him
to be a part of our family.

29:33.130 --> 29:36.588
Mom, you're gonna
have to wait 12 hours.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.096
Actually..

29:44.340 --> 29:46.570
Never underestimate
the power of mom.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.306
Give me time. I might even
get your teddy bear paroled.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.718
I still have no idea
where we are g0ing.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.886
[laughs]

29:56.920 --> 29:59.059
That's why it's called
a surprise.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.127
At least, we know here's
giving me a chance to think.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.966
You know, maybe we should
get outta here.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.161
- While we still can.
- Really?

30:12.370 --> 30:15.203
I don't know.
It could be an adventure.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.401
Raising a child on our own.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.447
Not knowin' anybody.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.515
[sighs]
My leaving, us escaping..

30:28.720 --> 30:31.109
That was just a dream.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.823
And Rosewood's a place
where dreams go to die?

30:36.500 --> 30:38.195
No.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.395
Not all of them.

30:41.430 --> 30:42.966
I had a dream..

30:44.470 --> 30:46.267
...of us being here.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.874
[Emily gasps]

30:54.980 --> 30:57.517
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.854
And if this is our
last chance of freedom..

31:08.900 --> 31:10.993
...let's make the most of it.

31:20.540 --> 31:23.008
- Spencer.
- Hi.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.769
What are you doin' here?

31:24.810 --> 31:27.074
You invited me, remember?

31:27.110 --> 31:29.601
Oh, yeah, I guess I did.

31:29.650 --> 31:31.470
- Now, come in.
- Thanks.

31:36.290 --> 31:38.758
I figured that you'd be
in Rosewood

31:38.790 --> 31:41.384
keeping tabs
on Tanner's case.

31:41.430 --> 31:44.399
No, what's going to happen
is going to happen.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.025
That doesn't sound
like the Spencer I know.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.161
A little surprise.

31:56.310 --> 31:57.538
May I?

31:58.510 --> 32:00.148
Of course.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.084
[Spencer sighs]

32:11.120 --> 32:12.348
'The whole drive up, I thought'

32:12.390 --> 32:14.984
'about just staying
on the road.‘

32:15.030 --> 32:17.498
Just following it
someplace else.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.363
And why didn't you?

32:21.470 --> 32:22.528
Hmm.

32:25.370 --> 32:27.531
You know what it's like
to be the outsider.

32:31.380 --> 32:32.529
I do.

32:32.580 --> 32:35.378
And when you move
from friends and family..

32:37.880 --> 32:40.212
Yeah, it's the worst.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.387
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

32:48.730 --> 32:51.255
It always seems like
we're saying goodbye.

32:51.300 --> 32:52.597
[scoffs]

32:55.270 --> 32:57.591
Do you remember
that kiss we shared?

33:00.410 --> 33:02.037
I do.

33:05.350 --> 33:07.773
That was nice, wasn't it?

33:07.810 --> 33:10.677
[instrumental music]

33:13.450 --> 33:17.159
And the night
has come

33:18.190 --> 33:20.420
And the land is dark

33:20.460 --> 33:24.248
And the moon is the only

33:24.300 --> 33:26.598
Light we'll see

33:27.730 --> 33:31.097
No I won't be afraid

33:31.140 --> 33:34.860
No I won't
be afraid

33:34.910 --> 33:39.677
As long as you stand by me

33:42.020 --> 33:43.874
So darling

33:43.920 --> 33:45.774
Stand

33:47.090 --> 33:48.785
By me

33:50.820 --> 33:54.051
Stand

33:54.090 --> 33:55.751
By me

33:58.230 --> 34:00.892
[indistinct]

34:00.930 --> 34:04.559
If the sky we look upon

34:05.510 --> 34:08.161
Should tumble and fall

34:08.210 --> 34:11.702
And the mountain
should crumble

34:11.740 --> 34:14.049
To the sea

34:15.180 --> 34:18.911
I won't cry
I won't cry

34:18.950 --> 34:22.215
No I won't shed a tear

34:22.260 --> 34:24.080
Just as long as

34:24.120 --> 34:27.556
You stand by me

34:29.760 --> 34:31.728
And darling

34:31.760 --> 34:34.797
Stand

34:34.830 --> 34:36.320
By me

34:38.610 --> 34:41.761
Stand

34:41.810 --> 34:43.675
By me

34:45.750 --> 34:48.901
Stand

34:48.950 --> 34:50.679
By me

34:52.620 --> 34:56.010
Stand

34:56.060 --> 34:57.789
By me

35:02.960 --> 35:06.350
When the night has come

35:07.430 --> 35:10.092
And the land is dark

35:10.140 --> 35:13.530
And the moon is the only

35:13.570 --> 35:16.107
Light we'll see

35:17.040 --> 35:20.407
No I won't be afraid..

35:20.450 --> 35:21.542
I do.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.076
I do.

35:24.120 --> 35:27.214
Just as long

35:27.250 --> 35:31.016
As you stand

35:31.060 --> 35:34.325
By me

35:43.100 --> 35:44.135
[door closes]

35:44.170 --> 35:46.331
- 'Hey.'
- Hey.

35:46.370 --> 35:47.837
How much time is left?

35:47.870 --> 35:49.235
It's 3:59 am.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.874
So...seconds.

35:51.910 --> 35:54.640
We all agreed that we'd be here
when the time ran down.

35:54.680 --> 35:57.478
- And here we all are.
- Except Aria.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.287
[sighs]

36:05.330 --> 36:07.457
I think that we should
make a promise.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.219
'No matter what happens next'

36:11.260 --> 36:13.694
'no matter what each of us
decides to do'

36:13.730 --> 36:16.494
we swear that the rest of us
will understand.

36:17.870 --> 36:20.304
No one will be blamed..

36:20.340 --> 36:21.637
...for anything.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.530
I swear.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.408
Me, too.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.115
I swear.

36:32.150 --> 36:35.278
[beeping]

36:39.190 --> 36:41.283
[buzzing]

36:46.300 --> 36:48.495
I'll tell you
what our choice is.

36:50.070 --> 36:51.389
[phone shatters]

36:53.940 --> 36:55.407
[exhales]

36:57.210 --> 36:59.929
Why didn't we think
of that earlier?

36:59.980 --> 37:02.346
- Okay, what now?
- We're supposed to wait here?

37:02.380 --> 37:05.213
That's exactly
what you should do.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.013
Toby got a hit
on the game's location.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.779
He texted Ezra to meet me.

37:08.820 --> 37:10.754
[dramatic music]

37:11.920 --> 37:13.353
[door opens]

37:13.390 --> 37:14.550
[door shuts]

37:29.080 --> 37:31.173
[beeping]

37:31.210 --> 37:32.939
[ringing]

37:32.980 --> 37:35.073
(AD)
'Dark night
of the soul, Aria?'

37:35.110 --> 37:36.668
It was. Yeah.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.075
Until I realized something.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.645
There's a way for me
to get you out of my life.

37:42.690 --> 37:46.581
- To end this. All of this.
- 'Really?'

37:47.230 --> 37:48.527
'What's that?‘

37:48.560 --> 37:51.256
I'm gonna turn myself in.

37:51.300 --> 37:54.667
I'll tell Tanner I killed
Dunhill, the others go free.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.691
It's a small price to pay
for what I've done to my friends

37:56.740 --> 37:58.389
and as a bonus,
I don't have to hear

37:58.440 --> 38:00.601
your miserable voice
ever again.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.403
'Well, that's very noble
of you.'

38:02.440 --> 38:05.375
'But there's just
one problem with your plan.‘

38:05.410 --> 38:08.106
'You're too late.‘

38:08.150 --> 38:09.447
What are you talking about?

38:09.480 --> 38:11.471
You-you said that
it was "Choose or lose."

38:11.520 --> 38:15.183
'Time ran out, Aria.
The game is over.‘

38:15.220 --> 38:16.881
'And guess what?‘

38:16.920 --> 38:20.686
- 'You won.'
- What? I don't--

38:20.730 --> 38:23.756
'Your grand prize,
chosen especially for you'

38:23.800 --> 38:26.428
'is an unlimited
supply of freedom.‘

38:26.470 --> 38:28.722
'Enjoy it wherever you want.‘

38:28.770 --> 38:30.590
'Perhaps, right where you are'

38:30.640 --> 38:31.868
'as things are going to get'

38:31.900 --> 38:33.458
'a little messy
with your friends.‘

38:33.510 --> 38:36.661
- Please, do not do this.
- 'It's done.‘

38:36.710 --> 38:40.373
'I hope you enjoyed
the game, Aria. I have.‘

38:40.410 --> 38:42.469
'I'm going to miss these calls.‘

38:42.520 --> 38:44.841
- No!
- 'Goodbye.‘

38:44.880 --> 38:46.347
[explodes]

38:46.390 --> 38:48.187
[crackling]

38:48.220 --> 38:51.485
[sighs]
Dammit!

38:51.520 --> 38:53.852
[panﬂng]

38:53.890 --> 38:55.755
[dramatic music]

39:03.900 --> 39:05.993
[intense music]

39:08.510 --> 39:10.478
Take the next left.

39:13.910 --> 39:15.343
Pull over.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.816
- Here?
- 'Pull over. This is it.'

39:18.850 --> 39:20.408
The location of the cell tower
that the gamer's

39:20.450 --> 39:22.839
been using to communicate.

39:22.890 --> 39:24.983
Where are we?

39:25.020 --> 39:26.954
Mona lives a block away.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.878
[beeping]

39:28.930 --> 39:31.057
[phone ringing]

39:31.100 --> 39:33.489
(automated message)
'You've reached Spencer.
Please, leave a message.‘

39:33.530 --> 39:35.691
Spence, I'm on my way
to you right now.

39:35.740 --> 39:36.820
If you will still take me.

39:36.870 --> 39:38.531
Look, I know that things are

39:38.570 --> 39:39.798
royally messed up right now

39:39.840 --> 39:41.728
and I know that
it's my fault, but..

39:41.770 --> 39:43.704
I-I think I have an idea
of how we can make things

39:43.740 --> 39:45.970
right again, so, please,
just let me try.

39:46.980 --> 39:47.969
[sighs]

39:49.280 --> 39:50.838
[muffled thud]

39:53.520 --> 39:55.647
[engine rewing]

39:56.460 --> 39:58.655
[rumbling]

40:05.530 --> 40:07.998
[dramatic music]

40:35.600 --> 40:37.488
[gasping]

40:37.530 --> 40:39.555
[intense music]

40:42.100 --> 40:43.863
[siren wailing]

40:47.910 --> 40:49.901
[indistinct radio chatter]

40:53.280 --> 40:54.599
[beeping]

40:54.650 --> 40:56.743
[dramatic music]

41:01.290 --> 41:02.746
It's warm.

41:09.760 --> 41:10.829
The signals from the game
are coming

41:10.860 --> 41:12.999
from inside the apartment.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.937
[music continues]

41:26.510 --> 41:28.239
[buzzing]

41:32.720 --> 41:34.813
[intense music]

41:46.770 --> 41:49.568
[theme music]
