00:00.014 --> 00:01.347
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

00:02.031 --> 00:03.398
- Good night.
- Bye.

00:05.662 --> 00:07.680
But the least you could do
is be honest with Jenny.

00:07.714 --> 00:08.685
That's what
this is all about?

00:08.719 --> 00:09.802
- Yeah.
- You always liked her.

00:09.836 --> 00:11.472
You kept flirting with me

00:11.506 --> 00:13.174
long after
you started dating her.

00:13.209 --> 00:14.542
Yeah, well,
that's gonna stop.

00:14.577 --> 00:16.140
And while you're at it,
no more running to me

00:16.175 --> 00:17.510
for favors
or asking me for help.

00:17.544 --> 00:19.443
How 'bout you find yourself
some other paralegal?

00:19.477 --> 00:21.177
Because, as far as I'm
concerned, we're done.

00:21.211 --> 00:22.512
You haven't even
gone to any law school.

00:22.546 --> 00:23.945
- I'm working there!
- Oh, yeah.

00:23.979 --> 00:25.178
What, as a lawyer?

00:25.213 --> 00:26.246
It's a long story, okay?

00:26.281 --> 00:27.885
But you can't
tell anyone, ever.

00:27.919 --> 00:30.357
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor.

00:30.391 --> 00:32.298
He is my oldest friend.

00:32.332 --> 00:33.866
You were there.
What would you do?

00:33.901 --> 00:35.436
I'd tell him everything.

00:35.471 --> 00:36.706
Watch Cameron go down.

00:36.740 --> 00:38.712
Sleep like a baby
after I did it.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.014
Harvey would never
use this,

00:40.048 --> 00:41.516
and he'd kill me
if he knew I had it.

00:41.551 --> 00:43.254
But can you use this...

00:43.288 --> 00:44.888
to help him?

00:44.923 --> 00:46.690
Clifford Danner.
He was 18.

00:46.725 --> 00:48.325
I put him in jail
12 years ago.

00:48.359 --> 00:49.459
He's innocent.

00:49.494 --> 00:50.794
Cameron buried the evidence.

00:50.829 --> 00:52.396
- You have enough to overturn?
- I don't know.

00:52.430 --> 00:53.396
So what are you
going to do?

00:53.431 --> 00:54.965
I'm gonna get him out.

01:00.137 --> 01:01.336
Mmm.

01:01.371 --> 01:02.738
Go, go.

01:02.772 --> 01:07.408
9224-4930-754229.

01:07.443 --> 01:08.609
Nope, that's not right.

01:08.644 --> 01:10.212
Right.
I gave it to you backwards.

01:10.247 --> 01:12.716
I have to keep it interesting
for myself.

01:12.750 --> 01:13.717
Ah, security code.

01:13.751 --> 01:15.953
You know I know it.

01:15.987 --> 01:17.254
Why are you wasting our time?

01:17.288 --> 01:19.425
'Cause I wanna
make you work for it.

01:19.459 --> 01:20.660
Oh, really?

01:20.695 --> 01:22.964
Well, maybe I don't feel
like working for it.

01:22.998 --> 01:24.765
Okay. All right--

01:24.800 --> 01:26.467
767! Stop.
No, no.

01:33.776 --> 01:36.746
What are you doing?

01:36.780 --> 01:38.814
Showering.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.618
Oh, you don't trust me
being here without you.

01:42.652 --> 01:43.619
No, I--

01:43.653 --> 01:45.687
I trust you, I just...

01:45.722 --> 01:48.357
You know,
I like everything just so.

01:48.391 --> 01:49.825
Well...

01:49.859 --> 01:52.496
just so doesn't mean clean.

01:52.531 --> 01:55.199
It means just so.

01:55.234 --> 01:57.702
Gotcha.
- Uh--

01:57.737 --> 01:59.704
- have a good day.
- Bye.

02:04.543 --> 02:06.010
Trevor.

02:06.044 --> 02:08.246
- Jesus. Uh--
- Surprise.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.247
- Can I come in?
- No.

02:10.282 --> 02:11.549
You, uh--
well, I'm late.

02:11.583 --> 02:13.518
So we should, you know,
grab a coffee on the way.

02:13.552 --> 02:15.087
Well, let me just--
let me just take a piss first.

02:15.121 --> 02:17.256
No, no.
Uh, Trevor, stop!

02:17.291 --> 02:18.591
Stop.

02:18.626 --> 02:20.161
You got a girl in there,
don't you.

02:20.195 --> 02:21.863
Let's go.

02:21.897 --> 02:23.865
- I'm just gonna take a pee.
- Trevor, stop. No, no--

02:23.899 --> 02:25.534
- It's fine.
- That's not even funny.

02:25.568 --> 02:27.136
Get your hand off the knob.
Get your hand off the knob.

02:27.170 --> 02:30.306
- We're going. I'll buy you breakfast.
- You're so serious.

02:30.341 --> 02:32.709
- He loves you!
- Go.

02:34.979 --> 02:36.647
I got a job.

02:36.681 --> 02:38.615
Law firm mail room,
of all places.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.384
Huh.

02:40.418 --> 02:42.353
I was wondering, um...

02:42.387 --> 02:44.355
think I could stay with you
for a couple days?

02:44.389 --> 02:46.223
Uh...

02:46.258 --> 02:48.559
I don't really know
if that's such a good idea.

02:48.593 --> 02:50.294
You know, I could have
died that day,

02:50.328 --> 02:52.530
if it hadn't been
for you and your boss.

02:52.564 --> 02:54.999
And I don't want to live
that life anymore.

02:55.033 --> 02:58.402
I really don't.

02:58.437 --> 03:00.571
I don't have anybody else.

03:05.610 --> 03:06.977
Okay.

03:07.011 --> 03:10.582
I was thinking, you know,

03:10.616 --> 03:12.050
maybe I'll try
and call Jenny.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.221
Yeah.
Uh, you should.

03:16.256 --> 03:17.690
Yeah.

03:24.766 --> 03:29.103
What are you doing here,
prosecutor?

03:29.137 --> 03:32.807
I believe you're innocent.

03:32.841 --> 03:37.345
You just found out you only
got six months to live?

03:37.380 --> 03:39.348
'Cause today ain't the day
you get your conscience clear.

03:39.382 --> 03:40.616
That's not the reason I'm--

03:40.650 --> 03:42.718
You know, I've been in here
a dozen years...

03:42.752 --> 03:44.286
While Jason Black
and Matt Bailey

03:44.321 --> 03:45.388
are out there
living it up.

03:45.422 --> 03:48.057
You think I give a shit
what you believe?

03:48.091 --> 03:51.861
- You wanna hit me?
- I wanna kill you.

03:51.895 --> 03:53.462
But I lay a finger on you,

03:53.497 --> 03:55.364
and they put me
in the hole for 48 hours,

03:55.398 --> 03:56.832
extend my sentence.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.969
I got four years left.

04:00.003 --> 04:01.770
I ain't doing another minute
than that.

04:01.805 --> 04:04.640
Good, 'cause I'm here for
your absolution.

04:04.674 --> 04:06.976
I'm here
for your redemption.

04:08.912 --> 04:11.748
This is the letter
I told you Jill wrote me.

04:11.782 --> 04:14.051
I know.

04:14.085 --> 04:16.187
The one you didn't
believe existed.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.887
I believe it now.
You were involved with her.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.857
- This is the proof.
- Involved with her?

04:19.892 --> 04:22.460
I loved her.

04:22.494 --> 04:23.762
And she loved me.

04:23.796 --> 04:25.630
Then why did you keep
this relationship a secret?

04:25.665 --> 04:26.731
Look at me, man.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.833
They gave me a scholarship
to that school.

04:28.867 --> 04:31.235
But nobody wanted me
dating anybody at that school.

04:31.269 --> 04:32.869
I had a record.

04:32.904 --> 04:35.138
If her father
ever found out,

04:35.172 --> 04:36.906
I'd have been done.

04:36.941 --> 04:37.974
They wouldn't have cared.

04:38.008 --> 04:39.875
Like you didn't care.

04:41.678 --> 04:43.111
Where'd this come from?

04:43.146 --> 04:45.080
It was buried,
but it got found.

04:45.114 --> 04:47.382
And this is why you
believe I'm innocent?

04:47.417 --> 04:48.817
Yes.

04:48.852 --> 04:50.386
And it's enough
to get me out?

04:50.421 --> 04:51.621
No.

04:51.655 --> 04:53.656
But that wasn't
the only thing they buried.

04:53.691 --> 04:56.026
Jill's dress had
your DNA on it.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.495
But there's another piece of
clothing that had blood on it.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.597
A camisole,
and they buried that

05:00.632 --> 05:03.400
because that DNA wasn't hers
and it wasn't yours.

05:03.435 --> 05:05.069
Let me guess.

05:05.103 --> 05:06.270
It was Jason Black's.

05:06.304 --> 05:09.740
Unfortunately,
I don't have access to his DNA.

05:09.775 --> 05:12.943
So you finally gonna go after
him and Matt Bailey?

05:12.978 --> 05:15.245
I'm not
a prosecutor anymore.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.914
Then what the hell
are you here for?

05:16.948 --> 05:19.516
I want you to let me
represent you.

05:22.152 --> 05:24.420
You think I'm gonna trust you
after what you did to me?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.655
I don't see anyone else
lining up

05:26.690 --> 05:29.058

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

06:10.163 --> 06:11.148
What's that?

06:11.149 --> 06:12.676
It's an article where
Clifford Danner took his plea.

06:12.677 --> 06:14.047
- Do you want me to read it to you?
- No.

06:14.048 --> 06:16.533
"Clifford Danner
had a history of violence.

06:16.636 --> 06:17.970
"This poor girl
was brutally murdered

06:18.004 --> 06:20.239
"at a high-end,
private school and, quote,

06:20.273 --> 06:22.241
"'this doesn't
sound like the work

06:22.276 --> 06:23.843
"of the squash team captain
to me.'"

06:23.877 --> 06:25.211
I don't know, Harvey,
this article makes

06:25.245 --> 06:27.047
a pretty compelling case
that he's guilty.

06:27.081 --> 06:28.982
Well, he's not.

06:29.016 --> 06:30.917
- It's quoting you.
- I was wrong.

06:30.951 --> 06:32.018
Jessica,
I don't think you should

06:32.052 --> 06:33.653
let Harvey take this case.

06:33.687 --> 06:35.989
Louis, we're talking
about a man's life.

06:36.023 --> 06:37.624
And if Harvey thinks
the kid didn't do it,

06:37.658 --> 06:38.624
then so do I.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.625
I understand that,

06:39.659 --> 06:40.693
but what Harvey thinks

06:40.727 --> 06:41.694
and what Harvey can prove

06:41.728 --> 06:43.095
are two different things.

06:43.129 --> 06:45.431
In my experience
with Harvey,

06:45.465 --> 06:46.966
it's one and the same.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.300
Listen to me--
he was set up.

06:48.335 --> 06:50.602
Jill Hodgkins
went to him and said

06:50.637 --> 06:52.037
that she was gonna turn in
these two other guys

06:52.072 --> 06:53.105
for selling coke.

06:53.139 --> 06:54.673
They killed her
and planted the coke

06:54.707 --> 06:56.108
in Clifford's room.

06:56.142 --> 06:58.410
I didn't buy his story
because his DNA was on her.

06:58.445 --> 06:59.845
He claimed that it
was because they were

06:59.879 --> 07:01.247
having this
secret relationship.

07:01.281 --> 07:02.882
But he had no proof.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.750
And now he does.

07:04.784 --> 07:06.218
Okay, I hate
to disagree with you here,

07:06.253 --> 07:08.254
but I took a little poll
of the partners--

07:08.288 --> 07:09.622
Whoa. You did what?

07:09.656 --> 07:10.756
Well, I was discreet,
I assure you.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.325
And they feel, as I do,

07:12.359 --> 07:14.360
that Harvey's actions
will hurt this firm.

07:14.395 --> 07:16.062
This firm?

07:16.096 --> 07:17.396
You mean my firm.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.564
And when you're
running the firm

07:18.598 --> 07:20.399
of Litt, nothing,
and nobody,

07:20.434 --> 07:22.435
then you can make
whatever call you'd like.

07:22.469 --> 07:24.236
Until then,

07:24.271 --> 07:26.072
you can just
get back to work.

07:26.106 --> 07:27.806
I'm telling you,
those guys did it.

07:27.841 --> 07:30.309
And as far as his violent
history is concerned,

07:30.343 --> 07:31.777
you of all people
are gonna tell me

07:31.811 --> 07:34.146
that a person can't change
if they get a second chance?

07:34.180 --> 07:35.914
What do you need me to do?

07:43.388 --> 07:45.991
Hey.

07:46.026 --> 07:47.459
I need your help.

07:47.494 --> 07:48.728
I thought I made it clear
that I don't expect

07:48.762 --> 07:50.196
to hear those words
from your mouth ever again.

07:50.230 --> 07:52.065
- It's important.
- It's always important.

07:52.099 --> 07:53.299
- It's for Harvey.
- It's always for Harvey.

07:53.334 --> 07:55.335
He specifically
asked for you.

07:55.370 --> 07:56.503
By name?

07:56.538 --> 07:57.805
He said he wanted the best.

07:57.839 --> 07:59.507
Well, if he didn't
specifically name me,

07:59.541 --> 08:01.342
and you didn't specifically
tell him,

08:01.376 --> 08:03.977
then I am going to
specifically decline.

08:05.679 --> 08:06.845
Rachel.

08:08.014 --> 08:09.214
Are you kidding me?

08:10.817 --> 08:11.784
Okay.

08:11.818 --> 08:13.352
I know that you're
mad at me.

08:13.386 --> 08:15.520
But we're talking about a guy
roughly our age

08:15.554 --> 08:16.921
who spent over a decade
in prison

08:16.956 --> 08:18.256
for a murder
that he didn't commit,

08:18.291 --> 08:19.858
and we are trying
to get him out.

08:21.427 --> 08:23.595
I think that's more important
than our little...

08:23.629 --> 08:25.631
whatever.

08:25.665 --> 08:26.632
Whatever?

08:26.667 --> 08:27.800
You know what I mean.

08:27.834 --> 08:30.336
Problems with two people.
Hill of beans.

08:30.371 --> 08:31.505
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:31.539 --> 08:32.706
<i>Casablanca.</i>

08:32.740 --> 08:34.174
Oh, I've never
seen that movie.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.811
- You--
- No, it's--it's old.

08:36.845 --> 08:38.011
Old?

08:38.047 --> 08:39.414
Oh, my God.

08:39.448 --> 08:41.450
Okay, what's your basis
for getting him out?

08:41.484 --> 08:43.552
- Prosecutorial misconduct?
- Buried evidence.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.954
Okay, then you need
precedence to overturn.

08:45.989 --> 08:48.157
- I already got those.
- Then what?

08:48.191 --> 08:49.558
I need to find out
everything I can

08:49.593 --> 08:51.827
about the former D.A.'s cases.

08:56.464 --> 08:57.631
Okay.

08:57.665 --> 08:59.366
<i>Gone With The Wind?</i>

08:59.400 --> 09:00.401
- No.
- <i>Citizen Kane?</i>

09:00.435 --> 09:02.136
- No.
- <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

09:02.170 --> 09:03.437
Nobody puts Baby
in the corner.

09:03.471 --> 09:05.472
- I can't believe you.
- I'm helping you.

09:05.507 --> 09:06.740
- Let's go.
- Ah...

09:06.775 --> 09:08.576
You thought to do this
on your own?

09:08.610 --> 09:10.444
I decided
to think like you.

09:10.478 --> 09:11.845
This is a high-profile
murder case

09:11.880 --> 09:13.914
against the new district
attorney himself.

09:13.949 --> 09:15.516
- You know that, right?
- I know.

09:15.550 --> 09:16.850
And you think I'm gonna
let you come with me

09:16.885 --> 09:19.186
for this, don't you?
I know you are.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.787
You known, I don't want you
thinking like me and--

09:20.822 --> 09:22.055
Now you know how
the rest of us feel.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.757
- Aha, right there.
- I always would have said that.

09:23.791 --> 09:24.991
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

09:29.530 --> 09:30.897
Harvey Specter.

09:30.931 --> 09:33.265
Terrance Wolf.
That's your case?

09:33.299 --> 09:35.467
I thought it best
to cut a deal,

09:35.501 --> 09:37.202
let him out for time served.

09:37.236 --> 09:40.205
Hm, high profile murder
at a prep school.

09:40.239 --> 09:42.840
No, I don't think I'll
be cutting any deals.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.909
Miguel Ruiz,
Lawrence Baker,

09:44.944 --> 09:46.745
Ray Jenkins,
Calvin Reynolds.

09:46.779 --> 09:48.347
And who are
these gentlemen?

09:48.381 --> 09:50.750
They're other cases
with improprieties

09:50.784 --> 09:53.887
that we'll be forced to cite
if we have to file to reopen.

09:53.921 --> 09:55.922
You, of all people,
don't want that.

09:55.957 --> 09:58.058
Really? Why not?

09:58.093 --> 09:59.427
Because it'll
make you look bad.

09:59.461 --> 10:01.596
Didn't happen on my watch.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.531
You're supposed to be
cleaning up the office.

10:03.566 --> 10:05.700
I find sunshine is the best
disinfectant.

10:05.734 --> 10:07.235
Your mother teach you that?

10:07.269 --> 10:08.670
No, Harvey,
life taught me that.

10:08.704 --> 10:10.172
This man's innocent.

10:10.206 --> 10:11.473
Then he should have
gone to trial.

10:11.508 --> 10:12.641
Evidence was buried.

10:12.675 --> 10:14.276
Then dig it up.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.278
And make your case.

10:16.312 --> 10:19.181
Mike...give me a minute.

10:22.385 --> 10:23.585
Terrance, you're
forcing me to do something

10:23.619 --> 10:24.953
that I'd rather not do.

10:24.987 --> 10:26.721
- And what is that?
- Take this case on.

10:26.755 --> 10:27.755
I win.

10:27.790 --> 10:29.157
It's what I do.

10:29.191 --> 10:32.060
It'll send a message
around your entire office.

10:32.094 --> 10:33.761
That you can't
handle your business.

10:33.796 --> 10:34.796
Well, if I lose, I lose.

10:34.830 --> 10:37.599
That's the way
the law works.

10:37.633 --> 10:38.767
But, Harvey, don't think

10:38.801 --> 10:40.602
I can't send a message
or two myself.

10:40.636 --> 10:42.337
Rumor has
it you're the traitor

10:42.372 --> 10:44.172
who sold out
his former boss.

10:44.207 --> 10:45.340
It wasn't me.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.575
Those rumors are wrong.

10:46.610 --> 10:49.378
So mysterious evidence

10:49.413 --> 10:51.280
from back in the day
on your old boss

10:51.314 --> 10:53.616
just appeared?

10:56.286 --> 10:57.920
You didn't know.

10:57.955 --> 11:00.423
It wasn't you.

11:00.457 --> 11:03.392
But it had to be somebody,
right, Harvey?

11:03.426 --> 11:05.161
Have a nice day.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.367
My office--now.

11:14.904 --> 11:18.140
I have never thought about
firing you.

11:18.175 --> 11:20.609
You took something
when we quit the D.A.'s office?

11:20.643 --> 11:22.078
Come clean right now,
or I'll let you go

11:22.112 --> 11:23.379
and not give it
a minute's thought.

11:24.514 --> 11:26.148
I knew it.

11:26.183 --> 11:28.351
You were in trouble.

11:28.385 --> 11:30.420
You had no right.

11:30.454 --> 11:33.123
I don't care.

11:33.157 --> 11:34.825
What'd you do with it?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.327
She did
what she had to do.

11:36.361 --> 11:37.328
She gave it to me.

11:37.362 --> 11:38.363
And the two of you saw fit

11:38.397 --> 11:39.831
to fight my battles for me?

11:39.866 --> 11:43.068
We did what you would have
done for either one of us.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.669
So get off your high horse.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.705
Leave the woman alone.

11:49.308 --> 11:52.344
We work because I've always
known that I can trust you.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.646
Don't ever go behind
my back again.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.882
You're welcome.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:09.496 --> 12:10.963
Wait, he called you?

12:10.998 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.
He left a message.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.136
What did he say?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.604
That...

12:18.639 --> 12:20.139
he wanted to see me.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.041
And what did you do?

12:22.076 --> 12:24.577
Texted him and I told him
I wasn't interested.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.315
Uh...we gotta tell him.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.450
No, we don't.

12:30.484 --> 12:31.584
Yeah, we do.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.352
I'm already
living a lie at work.

12:33.387 --> 12:35.054
I-I can't live one
at home too.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.756
Do you think that if you
told Trevor about us

12:36.790 --> 12:38.257
he's gonna keep
your secret to himself?

12:38.292 --> 12:39.425
I know Trevor.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.093
If I tell him,
he will take it up with me.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.261
If he hears it
from someone else--

12:42.295 --> 12:44.029
- Who's gonna tell him?
- I don't know!

12:44.064 --> 12:46.165
Okay? I just--I know
that he's over there right now,

12:46.199 --> 12:49.234
and it's drilling a hole
in my brain.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.869
Then stay here.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.770
- I can't.
- Why not?

12:52.805 --> 12:54.306
Because he came to me
for help.

12:59.812 --> 13:00.979
Okay.

13:04.049 --> 13:05.083
Okay what?

13:05.117 --> 13:06.684
Tell him.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.187
But please wait until
he has his life back together.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.589
What do you mean?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.823
He came to you for help.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.059
How much help do you think
hearing about us

13:14.093 --> 13:15.527
is gonna be for him?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.764
Okay.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.765
Okay what?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.600
Okay, I'll stay.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.071
Could you just not
touch anything?

13:26.106 --> 13:27.673
Because, uh...

13:27.707 --> 13:29.575
I like my place just so.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.078
What?
This place is a mess.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.246
What are you...

13:38.785 --> 13:42.588
The court finds
sufficient misconduct

13:42.622 --> 13:44.090
to warrant a new trial.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.592
Any pretrial motions
at this time?

13:46.627 --> 13:48.094
Yes, Your Honor.

13:48.129 --> 13:49.495
The state advises
that we will be seeking

13:49.530 --> 13:51.330
the maximum sentence
of life in prison.

13:51.365 --> 13:52.498
What?

13:52.532 --> 13:54.633
Your Honor, my client
has four years left.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.435
Mr. Specter,
the state has every right

13:56.469 --> 13:57.835
to seek that penalty.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.004
Would you like to confer
with your client

14:00.039 --> 14:02.306
before I vacate
his conviction?

14:02.341 --> 14:04.542
You could just withdraw
your motion right now.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.611
I'll confer with my client,
Your Honor.

14:11.216 --> 14:13.251
Get the message?

14:17.823 --> 14:19.825
Four more years.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.595
Or you get out now.

14:22.629 --> 14:26.865
Or stay in
the rest of my life.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.835
September 19, 2007.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.369
What?

14:30.404 --> 14:32.105
His halfway point.

14:34.408 --> 14:36.575
Day I realized
I could make it.

14:38.779 --> 14:39.879
You never said
this could happen.

14:39.913 --> 14:40.880
He's sending a message.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.081
It's got nothing
to do with you.

14:42.116 --> 14:43.516
It's got everything
to do with me.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.517
What do you wanna do?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.319
What do you think?

14:47.354 --> 14:49.522
If we win, I want in.
If we lose, I don't.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.323
We'll win.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.458
How do you know?

14:52.492 --> 14:53.726
Because I know.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.194
Same way you knew
I was guilty?

14:58.265 --> 14:59.465
What do you think?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.867
I think Harvey
wins his cases.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.135
What would you do?

15:05.104 --> 15:06.305
I'd trust him.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.243
Harvey, can you
give us a minute?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.724
Clifford...

15:25.758 --> 15:28.293
I don't you,
and you don't know me.

15:28.328 --> 15:33.398
But I'm gonna tell you a story
about what that man did for me.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.434
And why I think
you should trust him.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.510
Mr. Specter...

15:47.545 --> 15:49.112
Gonna withdraw your motion?

15:49.146 --> 15:51.947
Your Honor, my client
wishes to proceed to trial.

16:05.076 --> 16:07.657
Gensync Chemical.

16:07.658 --> 16:08.725
You dropped this today.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.094
Louis's client?

16:10.128 --> 16:13.231
Louis's Fortune 500 client.
You wanna guess why?

16:13.265 --> 16:15.500
His ears?
They freak a lot of people out.

16:15.534 --> 16:17.235
That was one client.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.371
His teeth?
Fidgeting?

16:19.405 --> 16:20.405
Could be anything.

16:20.439 --> 16:21.406
All right, stop it.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.641
Let me guess:
One of the board members

16:22.675 --> 16:23.908
has a kid
who went to his school.

16:23.943 --> 16:24.976
A daughter.

16:25.011 --> 16:27.012
And Lou's correctly
pointed out

16:27.046 --> 16:28.647
that they might not be
the only clients

16:28.681 --> 16:30.181
that will punish us
for taking this case.

16:30.215 --> 16:31.649
- Which costs us money.
- Mm-hmm.

16:31.684 --> 16:33.385
Louis is in the majority
this time.

16:33.419 --> 16:36.254
Which hurts your position
with the partners.

16:36.289 --> 16:37.556
You telling me to crop this?

16:37.590 --> 16:40.626
I'm telling you to win.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.027
But that's not why
I called you in here.

16:42.061 --> 16:43.696
Have a seat.

16:49.503 --> 16:50.736
Donna.

16:50.771 --> 16:52.371
Mm-hmm.

16:52.406 --> 16:53.606
You need to get over it.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.608
I'm trying.
It's not that easy.

16:55.643 --> 16:56.610
Yes, it is.

16:56.644 --> 16:57.778
Tell me.

16:57.812 --> 17:00.414
Okay.

17:00.449 --> 17:02.383
Think about what your life
would be like without her.

17:07.423 --> 17:08.557
Now I know.

17:08.590 --> 17:09.691
Know what?

17:09.726 --> 17:11.560
How you always forgive me.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.195
Oh, it's nowhere near
as easy to forgive you.

17:14.230 --> 17:16.065
Thank about it.

17:16.098 --> 17:17.900
Oh, I do.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.002
Every goddamn day.

17:31.147 --> 17:32.447
Hey.

17:32.481 --> 17:33.815
Hey.

17:33.849 --> 17:35.116
We're starting trial today.

17:35.151 --> 17:36.951
I know,
you've got five minutes.

17:36.985 --> 17:39.053
Never start a trial
without doing our thing.

17:39.087 --> 17:40.954
Yeah, well,
you don't have time.

17:40.989 --> 17:42.289
There's plenty of time.

17:42.323 --> 17:44.357
You don't have <i>time.</i>

17:48.562 --> 17:50.229
I'm sorry.

17:55.835 --> 17:56.969
For what?

17:57.003 --> 17:59.171
Don't push it.

17:59.205 --> 18:00.939
Okay, let's go.
You got three minutes.

18:00.973 --> 18:02.674
Okay, here or in my office?

18:02.709 --> 18:04.143
- Here's good.
- Okay, on three.

18:04.177 --> 18:05.277
One, two--

18:05.312 --> 18:06.479
Wait, let's go
in your office.

18:06.513 --> 18:07.947
- I'll get the can opener.
- Yeah.

18:12.619 --> 18:14.186
You left that
in the kitchen.

18:14.221 --> 18:16.088
Thanks.
I hate it when I do that.

18:16.123 --> 18:17.490
You don't have any numbers
in your speed dial.

18:17.524 --> 18:18.791
I don't need 'em.

18:18.825 --> 18:20.860
And yet you
forgot your phone.

18:20.894 --> 18:22.328
It's not the same thing.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.329
Okay.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.897
Hey, Rachel...

18:24.931 --> 18:26.332
Um...

18:26.366 --> 18:28.034
thank you for before.

18:28.068 --> 18:29.468
Sure.

18:29.503 --> 18:31.003
I mean...

18:31.037 --> 18:32.872
it was for Harvey.

18:32.906 --> 18:34.507
Yes.

18:34.541 --> 18:35.875
Hmm.

18:42.515 --> 18:43.516
Hey.

18:43.550 --> 18:46.486
Today's your first trial.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.388
What? I've been
to trial before.

18:48.422 --> 18:50.023
Yeah, but not when
you've been with me.

18:50.057 --> 18:52.292
Fair enough.

18:52.327 --> 18:54.561
Okay, I wanna start
a ritual with you.

18:54.595 --> 18:55.562
What do you wanna do?

18:55.596 --> 18:57.397
We're on the...

18:57.432 --> 18:58.398
phone.

18:58.433 --> 18:59.867
Remember that gymnastics video

18:59.902 --> 19:01.535
we saw?

19:01.570 --> 19:03.971
Yeah, I can
get behind that.

19:05.841 --> 19:08.409
- Feeling good?
- Never better.

19:08.444 --> 19:11.612
- You?
- I'm ready to roll.

19:11.647 --> 19:13.347
Don't think I didn't
see that can opener.

19:22.256 --> 19:24.224
What do you think you're doing
by opening this case?

19:24.258 --> 19:25.825
I'm making sure
an innocent man

19:25.859 --> 19:27.860
doesn't suffer
for the crimes of others.

19:27.894 --> 19:29.161
And what about Jill?

19:29.196 --> 19:31.030
Don't you care
how she suffered?

19:31.064 --> 19:33.332
You two would know more
about that than anyone, right?

19:33.367 --> 19:34.400
Excuse me.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.102
I bought the devastated friend
act

19:36.136 --> 19:37.503
12 years ago.

19:37.538 --> 19:38.805
But I know better now.

19:38.839 --> 19:41.608
Mike, meet Jason Black
and Matt Bailey.

19:41.643 --> 19:43.243
Just don't
shake their hands.

19:43.277 --> 19:45.411
They've got Jill Hodgkins' blood
all over them.

19:45.446 --> 19:46.879
Look, I don't know
what you think you know.

19:46.914 --> 19:48.981
But when I'm done testifying,
the jury's gonna know

19:49.015 --> 19:51.316
that Clifford killed Jill.

19:51.351 --> 19:52.518
Just 'cause
you switched sides,

19:52.552 --> 19:54.420
doesn't mean the rest
of the world did.

19:58.325 --> 20:01.227
- We just lost the letter.
- The what?

20:01.261 --> 20:03.262
I didn't realize he'd have
the nerve to lie on the stand.

20:03.296 --> 20:05.864
It's not exactly a giant leap
from killing someone.

20:05.899 --> 20:07.800
Perjury and murder,
they aren't the same thing.

20:07.834 --> 20:11.003
Yeah, murder's worse.

20:11.038 --> 20:12.638
It's easier.
Nobody's watching.

20:12.672 --> 20:14.606
Let's go.

20:14.641 --> 20:16.809
Mr. Black, what exactly
did Jill tell you

20:16.843 --> 20:19.044
regarding the defendant?

20:19.079 --> 20:20.913
She told me
she felt trapped.

20:20.947 --> 20:22.514
I thought she was
talking about school,

20:22.549 --> 20:25.784
but now I know
what she meant.

20:25.819 --> 20:29.321
That letter was dated
a week before she was killed.

20:29.356 --> 20:30.789
She must have
broken up with him,

20:30.824 --> 20:33.091
and this is how
he paid her back.

20:35.862 --> 20:38.297
Mr. Black, you said you didn't
see Jill Hodgkins

20:38.331 --> 20:39.798
at all on the day
of the murder.

20:39.832 --> 20:41.266
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.700
So there'd be no reason
for your blood

20:42.735 --> 20:45.403
to be on any of her clothing
at all.

20:45.437 --> 20:46.971
No, there'd be no reason.

20:47.005 --> 20:49.440
Would you be willing
to have a  DNA test, Mr. Black?

20:49.474 --> 20:50.908
Objection, Your Honor.
Prejudicial.

20:50.942 --> 20:52.510
We'll pay for it,
if that's a problem.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.811
Mr. Specter.

20:56.214 --> 20:59.383
It's about the DNA,
and they can't spin that.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.885
Detective Packel,

21:01.919 --> 21:04.254
the dress wasn't the only
article of clothing

21:04.288 --> 21:05.388
that you submitted,
was it?

21:05.423 --> 21:07.557
No, there was a camisole.

21:07.591 --> 21:09.125
Was it in your report?

21:09.160 --> 21:10.860
Yeah, if you bothered
to read it.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.195
I did read it, Detective.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.931
And what was the DNA analysis
on that camisole?

21:14.965 --> 21:17.266
- I never picked it up.
- Why is that?

21:17.300 --> 21:18.967
Well, it wasn't ready
till two days later

21:19.002 --> 21:20.569
and we already had enough
from the dress.

21:20.603 --> 21:22.003
Enough?

21:22.038 --> 21:23.271
A man's life is at stake.

21:23.306 --> 21:24.306
Enough for what?

21:24.340 --> 21:25.707
Enough for you
to put him away

21:25.741 --> 21:27.475
without bringing it up
for 12 years.

21:27.510 --> 21:28.810
Well, I did
pick up that test,

21:28.844 --> 21:30.111
along with the camisole.

21:30.146 --> 21:32.347
Your Honor, I'd like
to request a side bar.

21:32.381 --> 21:33.481
On what grounds?

21:33.516 --> 21:35.884
The camisole and any evidence
connected to it

21:35.919 --> 21:36.919
are inadmissible.

21:43.864 --> 21:44.864
This is bullshit.

21:44.898 --> 21:46.699
Easy.
What?

21:46.734 --> 21:48.568
Your Honor, in between

21:48.602 --> 21:50.002
picking up the camisole
at the precinct

21:50.037 --> 21:51.804
and dropping it off
at the lab,

21:51.838 --> 21:53.773
you can see here
the document is flawed.

21:53.807 --> 21:55.241
Therefore, the chain
of possession

21:55.275 --> 21:57.809
with respect to the camisole
was broken.

21:57.843 --> 21:59.210
You gotta be kidding me.

21:59.245 --> 22:01.513
It's inadmissible.

22:04.249 --> 22:07.052
First six.

22:07.086 --> 22:08.153
What?

22:08.187 --> 22:11.423
First six months
are the hardest.

22:11.457 --> 22:13.492
In your mind.

22:15.796 --> 22:18.398
I don't know if I can
do that again.

22:18.433 --> 22:22.203
Mr. Specter, you are
accusing a police officer

22:22.237 --> 22:24.238
of tampering with evidence.

22:24.273 --> 22:25.373
Yes, I am.

22:25.407 --> 22:27.208
When the results
of the DNA test came back,

22:27.242 --> 22:28.476
they didn't line up,

22:28.510 --> 22:30.945
and Detective Packel
changed the custody documents.

22:30.980 --> 22:33.348
Even if Mr. Specter's
assertions were true,

22:33.382 --> 22:35.083
it would automatically
taint the evidence anyway.

22:35.117 --> 22:36.417
He's got a point.

22:36.451 --> 22:38.219
That camisole
was what allowed us

22:38.253 --> 22:39.920
to reopen this case
in the first place.

22:39.955 --> 22:42.257
The camisole was proof
that evidence was buried.

22:42.291 --> 22:44.592
That's why the case
was reopened.

22:44.626 --> 22:46.126
An entirely separate issue

22:46.161 --> 22:48.562
from whether that evidence
can be used in this trial.

22:48.596 --> 22:50.097
Clifford...

22:50.131 --> 22:51.664
I don't know what's
going on in there,

22:51.699 --> 22:54.634
but no matter what they rule,

22:54.669 --> 22:56.236
he's not gonna
lose this one.

22:57.805 --> 22:58.771
You sure?

22:58.805 --> 23:00.172
Yeah.

23:00.207 --> 23:01.173
I am.

23:01.208 --> 23:03.109
- Your Honor...
- What's enough.

23:03.143 --> 23:05.043
I'm instructing the jury
to disregard

23:05.078 --> 23:08.013
all testimony relating
to either the camisole

23:08.047 --> 23:09.915
or the resulting DNA test.

23:14.487 --> 23:16.322
Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

23:16.356 --> 23:19.259
- Are you okay?
- Get out of my face.

23:19.293 --> 23:21.260
What the hell are you doing,
reopening this?

23:21.295 --> 23:22.662
You worried
about getting caught

23:22.696 --> 23:23.763
intentionally
tainting evidence?

23:23.798 --> 23:25.065
I didn't taint anything.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.699
What I did was help you
put away a guilty man

23:26.734 --> 23:28.702
for brutally killing
a young girl.

23:28.736 --> 23:31.204
I'm not gonna let you drag my
reputation through the gutter.

23:31.239 --> 23:32.806
Not without consequences.

23:32.841 --> 23:34.275
Are you threatening me?

23:34.309 --> 23:35.777
'Cause the truth is,
you wouldn't even be here

23:35.811 --> 23:37.512
if you hadn't
done something wrong.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.081
Me? Yeah.

23:39.115 --> 23:40.816
That's all well and good
for you to drag up shit

23:40.850 --> 23:42.051
from the past, huh?

23:42.085 --> 23:43.319
You're protected by
you shiny suit, right?

23:43.353 --> 23:44.820
What are you talking about?

23:44.854 --> 23:46.422
Lawyers never
go after their own.

23:46.456 --> 23:48.324
What is that Denzel movie?

23:48.358 --> 23:51.593
"Tell it to me
like I'm a five-year-old."

23:51.627 --> 23:54.096
Sometimes, the good guys
gotta do bad things

23:54.130 --> 23:55.697
to make the bad guys pay.

23:59.868 --> 24:01.902
It's time to start painting
outside the lines.

24:01.937 --> 24:03.570
How?

24:03.605 --> 24:05.406
If Mohammed won't
come to the mountain,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.675
we need to bring the mountain
to Mohammed.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.411
Really?
The mountain to Mohammed.

24:10.446 --> 24:12.080
- It's a thing.
- Yeah, I know.

24:12.114 --> 24:14.316
It just has no meaning to me
in this situation.

24:14.351 --> 24:15.418
You said you could
think like me.

24:15.452 --> 24:17.587
Figure it out.

24:17.621 --> 24:18.988
Okay, yeah.
I got it.

24:19.023 --> 24:20.857
- What is it?
- You tell me--I'll confirm.

24:20.892 --> 24:22.826
- Nice try.
- Damn it!

24:33.806 --> 24:35.272
Why'd you text me, Matty?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.807
We got nothin'
to talk about.

24:36.841 --> 24:38.909
I didn't text you.
You texted me.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.749
We gotta go.

24:44.783 --> 24:47.085
Come on, does it really matter
who texted who?

24:47.119 --> 24:49.121
Why not take advantage of the
fact you get to see each other?

24:49.155 --> 24:51.156
- Catch up.
- Talk about old times.

24:51.191 --> 24:53.392
Yeah, like that time
that you murdered that girl

24:53.427 --> 24:54.594
and framed an innocent man.

24:54.628 --> 24:55.662
We didn't do anything.

24:55.696 --> 24:57.564
- You're wasting your time.
- Am I?

24:57.598 --> 24:58.866
We know the truth.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.401
It's just a matter of time
until one of you

25:00.435 --> 25:01.602
turns on the other one.

25:01.636 --> 25:03.104
Question is,
who's it gonna be?

25:03.138 --> 25:04.205
We'll be there today.

25:04.239 --> 25:05.506
You're the ones
running out of time.

25:07.576 --> 25:08.909
Asshole.

25:10.445 --> 25:11.812
Looks like
the rattlesnakes

25:11.846 --> 25:15.115
are starting
to commit suicide.

25:15.149 --> 25:17.717
Holy shit, that's
from <i>Mississippi Burning.</i>

25:17.752 --> 25:20.320
This whole idea
is from <i>Mississippi Burning.</i>

25:20.354 --> 25:21.487
You know that movie?

25:21.522 --> 25:22.722
I was trying to stump you
with that one.

25:22.756 --> 25:23.723
Front to back.
Give me a break.

25:23.757 --> 25:24.891
Problem is, those two

25:24.925 --> 25:26.592
don't seem like
they're gonna break.

25:26.627 --> 25:28.228
They know
we don't have anything.

25:28.262 --> 25:31.097
Only now we do.

25:31.132 --> 25:33.933
So by the mountain
to Mohammed, you meant...

25:33.967 --> 25:35.668
DNA, comin' to Mr. Wolf.

25:35.703 --> 25:37.437
That's good.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.647
Hi, Donna.

25:47.681 --> 25:48.881
- Hi, Louis.
- You're never...

25:48.916 --> 25:50.116
- I know.
- Why?

25:50.150 --> 25:52.885
I need a favor.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.587
You mean Harvey
needs a favor.

25:54.621 --> 25:57.189
Oh, that's
very astute of you.

25:57.224 --> 26:00.226
A big one.

26:00.260 --> 26:02.361
You know your cousin
in the DNA lab?

26:02.396 --> 26:04.330
- We need something today.
- No.

26:04.364 --> 26:06.132
- It's for--
- I know what it's for.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.001
What do you want?

26:11.105 --> 26:12.138
I don't want anything.

26:12.172 --> 26:14.173
I will fill in for Norma.

26:17.344 --> 26:19.278
Okay...

26:19.312 --> 26:20.479
I'm not being vindictive--

26:20.513 --> 26:22.214
I'm sorry, do I have
the right office?

26:22.248 --> 26:23.849
Listen to me.
I want you, God damn it.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.550
And I will throw that secretary
right out the window

26:25.585 --> 26:27.118
if any of you
were gonna be my secretary,

26:27.153 --> 26:29.487
but I have a reputation
that I value.

26:29.522 --> 26:30.888
And I'm not gonna be putting
my reputation on the line

26:30.923 --> 26:33.057
for something that I
do not believe in...

26:33.091 --> 26:35.092
American Ballet Theater.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.363
No.

26:39.397 --> 26:41.864
Followed by a one-on-one
dinner with...

26:41.899 --> 26:43.833
Baryshnikov.

26:43.867 --> 26:44.834
Ah ha.

26:47.771 --> 26:49.806
Oh, mommy.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.508
I--I--

26:53.178 --> 26:54.912
no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.214
No. No.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.882
Mm-mmm.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.219
- Nope, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

27:00.253 --> 27:01.220
- Can't do it.
- Got it.

27:01.254 --> 27:02.488
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

27:02.523 --> 27:03.489
Do you understand why?

27:03.524 --> 27:04.524
It's very clear to me.

27:04.558 --> 27:05.558
No, no, because do you
understand why--

27:05.593 --> 27:06.726
I hear you, Louis.

27:06.761 --> 27:08.728
- Louis--
- I want to, but I can't.

27:08.763 --> 27:10.497
Shh...

27:10.531 --> 27:11.498
What?

27:11.532 --> 27:12.733
- Let go.
- What?

27:12.767 --> 27:13.800
Let go.

27:19.106 --> 27:20.807
Jessica would like
to see you in her office.

27:23.178 --> 27:24.611
Oh, that phony bitch.

27:27.749 --> 27:29.984
- Call your cousin.
- It is not that simple.

27:30.018 --> 27:31.185
Yes, it is.

27:31.219 --> 27:32.920
You've compromised
your principles before.

27:32.954 --> 27:34.454
- Do it now.
- Like I told Donna,

27:34.489 --> 27:36.056
this isn't for me.

27:36.090 --> 27:37.924
- This is for Harvey.
- Wrong!

27:37.959 --> 27:39.493
It's for me.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.228
Okay, you know,
you want this so bad,

27:41.263 --> 27:43.964
why don't you maybe compromise
your principles a little bit?

27:43.998 --> 27:45.099
Excuse me?

27:45.133 --> 27:46.633
Yeah.
You know my billables.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.369
You talk about it all the time.
"Louis has got big billables."

27:49.404 --> 27:50.704
You see my loyalty.

27:50.738 --> 27:53.240
Yet you refuse
to acknowledge my value.

27:53.275 --> 27:55.709
- Where's this going?
- Where is this going?

27:55.744 --> 27:59.113
When you said
"Litt, nothing, and nobody,"

27:59.147 --> 28:01.115
you know what that
said to me?

28:01.149 --> 28:04.084
That said, "Louis, you're never
gonna make senior partner."

28:04.119 --> 28:06.053
Well, Harvey's
running out of time.

28:06.087 --> 28:07.521
This is my leverage.

28:07.555 --> 28:08.923
I want to make
senior partner,

28:08.957 --> 28:11.125
and I want to make
senior partner now.

28:11.159 --> 28:13.260
Louis...

28:13.294 --> 28:15.562
I do not respond to threats.
I make them.

28:15.597 --> 28:17.765
So if you ever want to be
senior partner,

28:17.799 --> 28:19.733
you call your cousin.

28:19.768 --> 28:20.835
Now.

28:20.869 --> 28:23.304
All right.

28:23.338 --> 28:24.472
I don't need
to see the results.

28:24.506 --> 28:26.641
I saw their faces.
They did it.

28:26.675 --> 28:29.444
What happened
to the letter?

28:29.478 --> 28:31.346
They...

28:31.380 --> 28:32.580
They made it seem like
it didn't matter.

28:32.615 --> 28:34.115
Like, uh, he was jealous,

28:34.149 --> 28:36.484
and so he killed her.

28:37.987 --> 28:39.321
Wow, that...

28:39.355 --> 28:40.555
What?

28:40.590 --> 28:41.790
I'm just wondering...

28:41.824 --> 28:43.625
what would have happened

28:43.660 --> 28:46.061
if they hadn't kept their
relationship a secret?

28:51.401 --> 28:52.801
I have to make
a phone call.

28:52.835 --> 28:54.870
Okay.

28:56.873 --> 28:59.141
Jenny, hey.
It's me.

29:00.844 --> 29:04.813
I can't keep this a secret
from Trevor anymore.

29:04.848 --> 29:06.815
I need to tell him.

29:06.849 --> 29:08.450
Call me.

29:14.569 --> 29:15.902
DNA results.

29:15.936 --> 29:17.704
Jason Black and Matt Bailey,

29:17.738 --> 29:19.338
they match the samples
of the DNA

29:19.373 --> 29:20.706
taken from that camisole.

29:20.741 --> 29:21.707
They did it.

29:21.742 --> 29:23.576
Where'd you get that?

29:23.610 --> 29:24.677
I found it.

29:24.711 --> 29:26.045
Well, it doesn't
prove anything.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.048
- It's their blood on it.
- So what?

29:28.082 --> 29:29.383
They could have had
a gym class together,

29:29.417 --> 29:32.186
played flag football,
or any one of 100 other reasons.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.589
Jason Black said
he didn't see her that day.

29:34.623 --> 29:36.157
It's two specks of blood

29:36.192 --> 29:38.193
from what could easily be
any other day.

29:38.227 --> 29:39.861
- What's wrong with you?
- Me?

29:39.896 --> 29:42.998
You come in her with some
unauthorized DNA test and--

29:43.032 --> 29:44.600
and right away,
you expect me to just release

29:44.634 --> 29:46.669
a convicted felon into the stree--
- He didn't do it!

29:46.703 --> 29:48.270
And how can you allow him
to sit in there

29:48.305 --> 29:49.838
while these two other
murderers go free?

29:49.872 --> 29:52.441
Let me explain something
to you.

29:52.475 --> 29:54.876
My job's to prosecute.
Your job is to defend.

29:54.911 --> 29:56.578
I didn't bury any evidence.

29:56.612 --> 29:57.879
I didn't toss that DNA.

29:57.913 --> 29:59.881
The judge did that
based on fact.

29:59.915 --> 30:02.183
You're coming after me
for the sins of someone else.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.786
This piece of paper here
means nothing.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.755
So unless one
of those two boys

30:06.789 --> 30:09.458
just up and volunteered
that they killed that girl,

30:09.493 --> 30:11.560
your client's
gonna go back to prison

30:11.595 --> 30:12.895
for the rest of his life.

30:12.930 --> 30:15.098
Terrance, you have
a reputation as a fair man.

30:15.132 --> 30:17.267
I don't give a damn
what other people think of me.

30:17.301 --> 30:19.035
I care about
what I think of me.

30:19.070 --> 30:20.203
Yeah.

30:26.477 --> 30:28.077
Didn't work.

30:28.111 --> 30:29.578
What's next?

30:29.613 --> 30:31.780
What's next is we have
to put on a defense tomorrow.

30:31.814 --> 30:35.350
- We got nothing.
- So what are we gonna do?

30:35.384 --> 30:36.951
I don't know.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.223
Ooh, Rachel.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.524
What are you doing in here?

30:43.559 --> 30:45.293
You have access
to the partners' kitchen.

30:45.327 --> 30:47.762
Yeah, I like to keep
my finger on the pulse.

30:47.796 --> 30:50.498
Plus, they don't
have Cheetos.

30:50.532 --> 30:53.134
Actually, I don't care
about the pulse.

30:53.168 --> 30:54.735
Hmm.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.870
Okay, either
I am losing it,

30:56.905 --> 30:59.640
or you are upset
about something.

30:59.674 --> 31:01.342
So...

31:01.376 --> 31:02.376
What are you upset about?

31:02.410 --> 31:04.345
I don't wanna
talk about it.

31:04.379 --> 31:06.681
Got it.
Mike Ross.

31:07.683 --> 31:09.317
How do you know that?

31:09.351 --> 31:11.186
I'm Donna.
I know.

31:11.220 --> 31:13.155
Donna, what
am I gonna do?

31:13.189 --> 31:14.456
There's only
one thing to do.

31:14.490 --> 31:15.858
Quit?

31:15.892 --> 31:17.693
- Kill her?
- Well...

31:19.529 --> 31:21.330
You need a drink.

31:21.364 --> 31:23.932
Yes.

31:23.966 --> 31:24.966
Two?

31:26.868 --> 31:29.136
We should barf.

31:35.343 --> 31:36.909
Take 'em off.

31:36.944 --> 31:38.044
Huh?

31:38.078 --> 31:39.345
Take 'em off.
He's not an animal.

31:39.379 --> 31:40.546
I want to talk to him
like a man.

31:52.758 --> 31:56.962
What happened?

31:56.996 --> 31:58.297
Wolf won't
drop the charges.

31:58.331 --> 32:00.632
What?

32:00.667 --> 32:02.000
I tried everything.

32:02.034 --> 32:04.168
Y-you tried?

32:04.203 --> 32:06.003
Look, we can cut a deal.

32:06.038 --> 32:07.338
We can ask for more time.

32:07.372 --> 32:09.073
- He already said no way.
- We've got to...

32:09.107 --> 32:10.874
Try?

32:10.909 --> 32:12.709
Try like you did
with the DNA?

32:12.744 --> 32:16.212
I had 4 years--
4 years of 16

32:16.247 --> 32:18.047
that I only had in the first
place because of you.

32:18.082 --> 32:21.918
- Clifford, we--
- Shut up.

32:21.953 --> 32:23.254
Why don't you
take it out on me?

32:23.288 --> 32:24.422
What did you say?

32:24.456 --> 32:25.656
I said take it out on me.

32:25.691 --> 32:28.259
- Harvey--
- I put you in there.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.161
I let you rot.

32:30.195 --> 32:31.696
I didn't give it
a minute's thought

32:31.731 --> 32:34.700
for over a decade.

32:34.734 --> 32:36.302
- Don't push me.
- Why not?

32:36.336 --> 32:37.970
I deserve it.
It's my fault.

32:38.005 --> 32:39.572
You said it yourself.
Harvey...

32:39.606 --> 32:40.973
They'll put me back
in the hole, that's why not.

32:41.007 --> 32:42.408
And increase your sentence?

32:42.442 --> 32:43.809
It's gonna happen anyway.

32:43.843 --> 32:44.843
- Guard.
- Come on.

32:44.878 --> 32:45.844
You know, Jason Black--

32:45.879 --> 32:47.045
I said don't push me.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.547
- Guard, come in here!
- They killed Jill.

32:48.581 --> 32:50.749
And they are out there
laughing their asses off--

32:50.784 --> 32:52.217
- oof!
- Hey, knock it off.

32:52.252 --> 32:53.619
Let's go.

32:53.653 --> 32:55.754
Get off of him.
Let's go.

32:55.788 --> 32:57.755
You said you'd get me
out of here!

32:57.790 --> 32:59.491
You said you'd get me out!

33:02.862 --> 33:04.429
What just happened?

33:04.464 --> 33:07.166
I just bought us
48 hours.

33:13.041 --> 33:14.375
Now what?

33:14.409 --> 33:15.910
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of one of those guys

33:15.944 --> 33:17.278
and get him to rat
on the other one.

33:17.312 --> 33:19.113
- Which one?
- The weaker one.

33:19.148 --> 33:20.381
Which one is that?

33:20.416 --> 33:22.150
The one who didn't testify.

33:22.184 --> 33:23.618
You're serious.

33:23.653 --> 33:24.686
You can't do that.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.820
Who's gonna stop me?

33:25.854 --> 33:27.488
Harvey, it wouldn't
be admissible.

33:27.523 --> 33:28.589
You'll never
get them that way.

33:28.624 --> 33:30.324
- It'll get Clifford out.
- How?

33:30.359 --> 33:32.793
Wolf won't be able to deny
that he's innocent anymore.

33:32.828 --> 33:34.128
Harvey, you don't do this.

33:34.162 --> 33:35.796
You can't beat people.
That's not what you do.

33:35.831 --> 33:39.868
- It is today.
- Harvey, stop!

33:39.902 --> 33:41.403
Listen, I got another idea.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.071
- What?
- You'll like it.

33:43.105 --> 33:44.773
It's from
<i>Mississippi Burning.</i>

33:44.807 --> 33:46.241
Come on.

33:51.515 --> 33:55.084
♪ ♪

33:55.118 --> 33:58.221
So all of these things
are from clients?

33:58.255 --> 33:59.222
Yeah, pretty much.

33:59.256 --> 34:01.357
This pen?

34:01.392 --> 34:02.592
Remember that big
Trump scandal

34:02.626 --> 34:04.127
you heard about last year?

34:04.161 --> 34:05.962
- No.
- Exactly.

34:08.431 --> 34:10.799
Ooh, don't touch that.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.734
Signed by Patrick Ewing.

34:12.768 --> 34:14.335
He'll know.
I'll never hear the end of it.

34:14.370 --> 34:16.170
All right.
And this one?

34:16.205 --> 34:19.007
- Bird.
- He's from Boston.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.675
You know,
white man's hero.

34:20.710 --> 34:24.213
Oh.

34:24.246 --> 34:26.215
Yeah, it's Kobe.
He won't care.

34:28.284 --> 34:29.719
You really know him.

34:29.754 --> 34:32.556
Hmm.

34:32.590 --> 34:34.158
I really do.

34:44.704 --> 34:45.771
No.

34:45.804 --> 34:47.306
Never?

34:47.340 --> 34:48.974
No.

34:49.009 --> 34:50.208
Ever?

34:50.243 --> 34:51.610
No.

34:51.643 --> 34:54.045
- Never, ever?
- No.

34:56.983 --> 34:58.484
Why not?

35:05.059 --> 35:07.060
Because you can
never go back.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.034
I gotta pee.

35:37.125 --> 35:38.726
Hey, man.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.428
I got your message.
What'd you wanna talk about?

35:41.462 --> 35:43.497
It can wait.

35:43.531 --> 35:45.432
Remember when you said
you would have died that day

35:45.466 --> 35:46.600
if it hadn't
been for Harvey?

35:46.634 --> 35:47.768
Yeah.

35:47.803 --> 35:49.570
Well...

35:49.604 --> 35:50.805
He needs your help.

36:02.133 --> 36:04.401
Wake up, Matt.

36:09.874 --> 36:11.475
Who are you?
What do you want?

36:11.510 --> 36:14.244
It's not who I am.
It's who I represent.

36:14.278 --> 36:16.613
Jason Black.

36:16.647 --> 36:18.115
He knows you talked
to the police.

36:18.149 --> 36:19.449
No, I didn't, I swear.

36:19.483 --> 36:21.852
That's not my department.

36:21.886 --> 36:22.986
Now, Matt...

36:23.020 --> 36:24.921
you're gonna
retract what you said.

36:24.955 --> 36:26.155
You're gonna leave town.

36:26.190 --> 36:28.757
And you're never gonna
talk to them again.

36:28.792 --> 36:30.325
Or next time....

36:34.497 --> 36:36.332
that's gonna be your head.

36:38.202 --> 36:40.937
Bye, Matt!

37:01.360 --> 37:02.360
Somebody call the police?

37:04.831 --> 37:06.065
You.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.867
You, what are you--
what are you doing here?

37:07.901 --> 37:10.236
Hey, Matt...relax.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.973
The Detective was across
the street the whole time.

37:13.007 --> 37:16.176
We knew Jason
would send somebody.

37:16.211 --> 37:17.411
What?

37:17.446 --> 37:18.613
Who do you think
told Jason

37:18.647 --> 37:19.914
you went to the police
in the first place?

37:19.949 --> 37:21.650
I did...
Harvey showed me the results

37:21.684 --> 37:23.185
of the DNA test.

37:23.219 --> 37:24.219
Two splotches.

37:24.253 --> 37:26.755
Jason Black's and yours.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.627
Okay, um...

37:31.662 --> 37:33.563
Uh, I want to file
a report.

37:33.597 --> 37:35.832
Oh.

37:35.866 --> 37:36.999
Sure.

37:37.034 --> 37:38.300
I'll take you downtown.

37:38.335 --> 37:39.535
You can look
through the books.

37:39.569 --> 37:40.903
Maybe you find something.

37:40.937 --> 37:42.004
Maybe you don't.

37:42.038 --> 37:43.805
But your real problem
isn't that guy.

37:43.839 --> 37:45.707
It's Jason Black.

37:45.741 --> 37:48.342
Somebody was gonna
turn him in once before.

37:48.377 --> 37:50.678
And I think you know
the lengths he'll go to...

37:50.712 --> 37:52.346
to shut somebody up.

37:52.380 --> 37:54.715
No, I don't.
No, I don't.

37:54.749 --> 37:56.717
We were here this time.
We won't be here next time.

37:56.751 --> 37:57.885
Next time?
What would have happened

37:57.919 --> 37:59.353
if he would have
killed me this time?

37:59.388 --> 38:01.355
Well, you'd be dead,
and we'd have caught the guy

38:01.390 --> 38:03.524
and used him to put Jason away
for murder.

38:03.558 --> 38:04.725
Shit, we should have
done that.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.594
- Yeah.
- Harvey, behave.

38:06.629 --> 38:08.096
What do you want?
What do you want from me?

38:08.130 --> 38:09.297
What do you want
from me?!

38:09.331 --> 38:10.732
Confess to the crime.

38:10.766 --> 38:12.133
Turn in Jason Black.

38:12.168 --> 38:13.468
No, I can't do that.

38:13.503 --> 38:14.736
Yes, you can.
I'll tell you why.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.504
You were 16.

38:16.539 --> 38:17.572
A juvenile.

38:17.606 --> 38:19.040
That's three years maximum.

38:19.074 --> 38:20.375
Less, if you're the one
who comes forward.

38:20.409 --> 38:21.409
We'll get you a deal.

38:21.443 --> 38:22.543
No, you can't
make that promise.

38:22.578 --> 38:23.611
You're not the D.A.

38:23.645 --> 38:24.745
You'd rather negotiate
with Jason?

38:24.780 --> 38:26.613
Because he'll kill you,

38:26.648 --> 38:28.115
and you know it.

38:28.149 --> 38:29.883
It was his idea.
I didn't wanna do it.

38:29.917 --> 38:31.985
I didn't
wanna do it.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.721
Okay. Get dressed
and come with me.

38:34.755 --> 38:36.923
Go.

38:36.957 --> 38:39.692
Hey, by the way,
where'd you get that bruise?

38:39.727 --> 38:42.462
Sometimes the good guys
got to do bad things...

38:42.497 --> 38:43.964
To make
the bad guys pay.

38:43.998 --> 38:45.165
That's right.

38:49.003 --> 38:50.403
What?

38:50.438 --> 38:52.672
What? Should have
let me do the talking.

38:52.707 --> 38:53.940
Wouldn't work.
You're not ready yet.

38:53.975 --> 38:56.176
Not ready?
This whole thing was my idea.

38:56.210 --> 38:58.178
You lost in housing court.

38:58.212 --> 38:59.780
You think you could
handle a murderer?

38:59.814 --> 39:01.648
<i>Mississippi Burning.</i>
You're welcome.

39:01.683 --> 39:03.651
I let you say
the juvenile thing.

39:03.685 --> 39:05.352
That was pretty bad-ass,
wasn't it?

39:06.655 --> 39:08.823
Really?
Thought I nailed it.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.001
Shower girl.

39:23.705 --> 39:26.507
Hey, Mike, it's Rachel.

39:26.541 --> 39:27.708
I know I shouldn't
be doing this,

39:27.742 --> 39:29.576
and I--I know you're
seeing Jenny,

39:29.611 --> 39:32.913
but I--I can't stop
thinking about the kiss.

39:32.947 --> 39:35.916
And...I can't go back.

39:41.956 --> 39:44.658
Looks like one of 'em
up and confessed.

39:44.692 --> 39:45.926
We'll get your client out.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.928
I'll back your motion
to expunge his record.

39:47.963 --> 39:49.664
I'll facilitate his release.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.068
You don't seem very happy.

39:55.071 --> 39:57.105
You think I don't know
you set those boys up

39:57.139 --> 39:58.406
and coerced that whole thing?

39:58.441 --> 39:59.974
Set 'em up?
How would I do that?

40:00.009 --> 40:01.476
I don't know.
What difference does that make?

40:01.510 --> 40:03.211
- I know you did it.
- You know?

40:03.245 --> 40:04.913
The same way you knew
Clifford was guilty?

40:04.947 --> 40:07.749
No, you don't get to tell me
it's one way in court

40:07.783 --> 40:08.850
and another out here.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.251
You can't prove it...

40:10.286 --> 40:11.286
you don't know anything.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.353
Well, you broke the law.

40:12.388 --> 40:13.722
Tell yourself
whatever you want.

40:13.756 --> 40:15.924
I'll tell myself
I got an innocent man out

40:15.959 --> 40:17.726
and I put
two guilty ones in.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.362
The I'll close my eyes
and I'll sleep like a baby.

40:22.932 --> 40:24.466
One other thing.

40:26.703 --> 40:28.603
You got a little something
right over here.

40:31.207 --> 40:32.908
I like you.

40:34.644 --> 40:36.177
By the way, how did you
make those guys

40:36.212 --> 40:37.912
think that they were
texting each other?

40:37.946 --> 40:39.948
I bought a prepaid phone.

40:39.982 --> 40:41.249
Set it to "private."

40:41.283 --> 40:42.817
I texted each one
it was the other.

40:42.851 --> 40:44.518
- Who else would it be?
- You.

40:44.553 --> 40:46.454
Yeah, but they're
not gonna think that.

40:46.488 --> 40:48.155
That's cool.
You'd make a good criminal.

40:48.190 --> 40:49.424
Yeah, better than you.

40:49.458 --> 40:51.258
Uh, excuse me,
I was an amazing criminal.

40:51.293 --> 40:53.694
You don't remember--
briefcase popping open,

40:53.728 --> 40:55.262
drugs spilling everywhere.

40:55.297 --> 40:56.563
Okay, that was
a mechanical failure,

40:56.598 --> 40:57.898
and that could have
happened to anybody.

40:57.932 --> 40:59.166
Weed was all over
the floor.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.834
Oh, shit, I forgot
my phone again.

41:00.868 --> 41:02.535
- Here, can I borrow yours?
- How do you have this memory?

41:02.570 --> 41:05.071
- You keep forgetting your phone.
- It's not the same thing.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.842
Trevor, it's Mike.

41:10.877 --> 41:13.545
Uh, I need you
to call me back.

41:13.579 --> 41:16.814
Remember that thing
that I said could wait.

41:16.848 --> 41:18.482
It can't anymore.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.418
Something I gotta tell you.

41:27.025 --> 41:28.459
Ms. Pierson.

41:28.493 --> 41:29.460
I'm Trevor Evans.

41:29.495 --> 41:31.429
I'm a friend of Mike Ross.

41:31.463 --> 41:32.930
Yes?

41:32.965 --> 41:35.032
I wish I didn't
have to do this.

41:37.068 --> 41:39.170
There's something
you need to know about him.

41:41.841 --> 41:43.308
Something Harvey Specter
hasn't told you.
