WEBVTT

00:10.074 --> 00:11.739
Donna...

00:12.870 --> 00:14.223
Donna.

00:14.224 --> 00:15.557
You know, in all the years
that we worked together,

00:15.559 --> 00:17.225
you've been over
to my place exactly twice,

00:17.227 --> 00:18.660
the God-awful
dinner party and...

00:18.662 --> 00:19.761
the other time.

00:19.763 --> 00:21.029
I have been gone
three weeks,

00:21.031 --> 00:23.131
and you've been here
that many times. What?

00:23.133 --> 00:24.733
I had a good time
at that dinner party.

00:24.735 --> 00:26.935
Oh, my God, it is
just like you to make a joke.

00:26.937 --> 00:28.937
And ignore the other time.

00:31.007 --> 00:33.141
I brought you
your bonus.

00:36.779 --> 00:38.446
Really?
You thought that

00:38.448 --> 00:39.848
would make it all better,
handing me a check?

00:39.850 --> 00:41.449
Look, I know that
you're pissed.

00:41.451 --> 00:43.218
- Oh, what gave it away?
- Donna...

00:43.220 --> 00:45.787
You just had to jump in there
at the trial, didn't you?

00:45.789 --> 00:47.923
You just had to fight
my battles for me.

00:47.925 --> 00:49.824
Yeah, I did that because,
the last time I saw you,

00:49.826 --> 00:51.660
you were pissed that
I didn't fight for you.

00:51.662 --> 00:53.461
Well, congratulations, Harvey.
All you managed to do

00:53.463 --> 00:56.031
was make it look
like I love you.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.599
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:57.601 --> 01:00.001
Oh, my God,
you think I do.

01:02.139 --> 01:05.507
I have actually never met
such a self-important--

01:05.509 --> 01:07.776
Donna, about that time,
you once told me--

01:07.778 --> 01:09.644
I don't care what
I once told you!

01:09.646 --> 01:10.979
That wasn't
what Louis was asking.

01:10.981 --> 01:12.314
He was asking if
I love you.

01:12.316 --> 01:13.782
And you wouldn't answer.

01:13.784 --> 01:15.383
Because he was forcing
a yes or no answer

01:15.385 --> 01:18.453
to a complicated question.

01:18.455 --> 01:21.923
I am not in love
with you, Harvey.

01:23.059 --> 01:25.427
I love you
like a brother

01:25.429 --> 01:26.962
or a cousin,
somebody that

01:26.964 --> 01:29.297
you really, really look forward
to seeing at Christmas,

01:29.299 --> 01:31.499
and then you're really,
really glad to see leave.

01:31.501 --> 01:33.435
And as far as
you and I are concerned,

01:33.437 --> 01:34.836
Christmas is over.

01:34.838 --> 01:36.471
I didn't just come here
to give you a check.

01:36.473 --> 01:37.939
I came here
to get you back.

01:37.941 --> 01:39.307
What, Cameron
not working out?

01:39.309 --> 01:41.243
I heard that little shit
redid my entire filing system.

01:41.245 --> 01:43.845
Cameron's fine.
Look, I need you.

01:43.847 --> 01:47.215
- Need?
- Need.

01:47.217 --> 01:48.817
- Well, what about Jessica?
- Already signed off.

01:48.819 --> 01:50.185
How did you get her
to do that?

01:50.187 --> 01:54.422
Because I told her
I can't be me without you.

01:55.925 --> 01:58.793
- No, you didn't.
- Well, I thought it.

01:58.795 --> 02:00.562
And she knows it.

02:00.564 --> 02:01.963
Okay, I will come back
on two conditions.

02:01.965 --> 02:05.800
One is you replace that check
with a bigger one.

02:05.802 --> 02:08.902
And the other?

02:15.378 --> 02:16.845
Harold...

02:16.847 --> 02:20.348
Is that porn?
No.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.717
Well, yes, but that's not
what I'm using it for.

02:22.719 --> 02:24.286
Okay, I'm about 150% sure

02:24.288 --> 02:27.155
that I'm gonna
regret this, but...

02:27.157 --> 02:28.189
What are you using it for?

02:28.191 --> 02:30.025
I'm looking at tattoos.

02:30.027 --> 02:31.926
I told you, it's what
I'm getting with my first--

02:31.928 --> 02:34.863
Bonus time,
boys and girls.

02:34.865 --> 02:37.866
Too much.
<i>Way</i> too much.

02:37.868 --> 02:42.103
Oof, multiply this by zero,
and it's still way too much.

02:42.105 --> 02:44.272
O'Neil, Racine,

02:44.274 --> 02:47.342
Sabbatini...
no Ross.

02:47.344 --> 02:49.044
- Very funny, Louis.
- I'm not kidding.

02:49.046 --> 02:51.546
It looks like
you came up empty.

02:58.187 --> 03:00.188
You have the file for
the Solis motion to dismiss?

03:00.190 --> 03:02.857
Yep, all set.
Main citations are tabbed.

03:02.859 --> 03:06.361
Good. Go.
I'm busy.

03:06.363 --> 03:08.763
Okay, I was just, um...

03:08.765 --> 03:11.299
you know, before,
um...you--

03:11.301 --> 03:13.668
Are you having a stroke?

03:13.670 --> 03:15.203
What?
My bonus.

03:15.205 --> 03:16.771
Louis didn't have it.

03:16.773 --> 03:18.640
Well, at least, he said
that he didn't have it,

03:18.642 --> 03:20.241
so I thought
that maybe you, uh...

03:20.243 --> 03:22.377
Maybe Jessica thinks
you don't deserve one.

03:22.379 --> 03:25.046
You know, because...
you're not a lawyer.

03:25.048 --> 03:28.416
Right, right.
No, that's true, so I guess

03:28.418 --> 03:29.918
these won't be
doing you any good.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.186
Jessica thinks
you're not a lawyer.

03:31.188 --> 03:33.188
I don't think that.

03:37.593 --> 03:41.162
Um...wow.

03:41.164 --> 03:43.631
Your Monica Eton
performance worked.

03:43.633 --> 03:47.001
You switched Carson,
Gallo, and Fogerty.

03:47.003 --> 03:48.336
Wait, is that why
you're giving me so much?

03:48.338 --> 03:50.171
Yes. We're up one.

03:50.173 --> 03:51.606
You might want to
hold onto it for a bit.

03:51.608 --> 03:53.007
- Why?
- Hanson.

03:53.009 --> 03:54.109
Took a job at
the Justice Department.

03:54.111 --> 03:57.178
Our lead is gone.
Now we're even.

03:59.049 --> 04:01.182
Well, the vote's
in four days.

04:01.184 --> 04:04.152
The tie goes to the incumbent.
So we're good.

04:04.154 --> 04:08.089
- Probably.
- Nice.

04:08.091 --> 04:10.358
Uh, you do realize that
"hold onto it for a bit" thing,

04:10.360 --> 04:12.527
that's just
a figure of speech.

04:12.529 --> 04:16.664
Yeah, okay,
I'm just...

04:24.508 --> 04:25.974
You wanted to see me?

04:25.976 --> 04:29.210
Saw you handing out bonuses
to the associates earlier.

04:29.212 --> 04:31.813
They must all
be feeling grateful.

04:31.815 --> 04:33.648
The firm was
quite generous.

04:33.650 --> 04:36.451
It's not just the associates
who should be rewarded.

04:36.453 --> 04:37.719
Well, for me personally,
it's the satisfaction

04:37.721 --> 04:39.487
of the work
that drives me.

04:39.489 --> 04:42.457
Although the money
does help keep score.

04:42.459 --> 04:43.525
You misunderstand me.

04:43.527 --> 04:44.893
I don't have a check
for you, Louis.

04:44.895 --> 04:48.730
I was hoping
you had one for me.

04:48.732 --> 04:49.864
I'm sorry,
I'm confused.

04:49.866 --> 04:51.599
Jessica is the one

04:51.601 --> 04:53.701
who handles the bonuses
for the partners.

04:53.703 --> 04:55.703
I'm not talking
about a bonus check.

04:55.705 --> 04:58.640
I'm talking about a buy-in check
for a senior partnership.

04:58.642 --> 05:02.444
As founding partner,
I'm entitled to name

05:02.446 --> 05:06.314
one new senior partner
a year.

05:06.316 --> 05:08.516
I'm naming you.

05:14.924 --> 05:18.059
You're making--
you're--

05:18.061 --> 05:20.361
you're making me...
- Yes.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.138 --> 05:31.339
I can't wait
to tell everybody.

05:31.341 --> 05:33.575
My mother, my father,
Rabbi Shimkoff...

05:33.577 --> 05:36.644
Yes.

05:36.646 --> 05:40.482
Oh, my God, the look
on Harvey's face!

05:40.484 --> 05:42.383
Louis...

05:42.385 --> 05:44.486
It's official
as of this moment.

05:44.488 --> 05:46.221
But I think we should
make the actual announcement

05:46.223 --> 05:48.423
at the next
senior partners meeting.

05:48.425 --> 05:49.757
Sure, the meeting where

05:49.759 --> 05:50.859
the managing partner
will be voted on.

05:50.861 --> 05:53.361
I believe that is
on the agenda.

05:53.363 --> 05:57.599
Best to do these things
face to face, don't you agree?

05:57.601 --> 06:00.835
It's our secret.

06:00.837 --> 06:02.537
Tomorrow's just like
any other Tuesday.

06:02.539 --> 06:04.506
Exactly.

06:04.508 --> 06:09.077

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

07:30.678 --> 07:32.111
Get out.

07:32.113 --> 07:33.613
And take your color-coded
filing system with you.

07:33.615 --> 07:35.315
It's a system.
How do I--

07:35.317 --> 07:38.151
I'm trying to give the moment
some dramatic flair.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.053
Jeez, now he
ruined that too.

07:40.055 --> 07:43.222
God.

07:43.224 --> 07:44.424
That's it?

07:44.426 --> 07:46.326
That was worth making
a whole condition?

07:46.328 --> 07:47.860
I've never
fired anyone before.

07:47.862 --> 07:49.462
You know he's
a floating temp, right?

07:49.464 --> 07:53.032
I mean, he'll be on somebody
else's desk by the end of lunch.

07:53.034 --> 07:56.736
Does everyone
have to rain on my parade?

08:06.314 --> 08:07.647
First of all, you just
have to look at the statistics.

08:07.649 --> 08:09.649
I mean, this guy Solis
could barely crack

08:09.651 --> 08:11.718
20 homers a season
a few years ago.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.153
And now he's banging out
over 40 a year?

08:14.155 --> 08:17.090
What's that supposed to be,
the wisdom of age?

08:17.092 --> 08:18.491
And you don't even
have to look at

08:18.493 --> 08:19.559
what he's doing on the field

08:19.561 --> 08:20.693
to wonder if
this guy is juicing.

08:20.695 --> 08:23.329
Just take a look at him.

08:23.331 --> 08:24.864
Now, look, I might not
be a scientist,

08:24.866 --> 08:27.500
but I do have common sense,

08:27.502 --> 08:30.103
and it says
this guy is doping.

08:30.105 --> 08:35.341
But hey, that's just
<i>one man's opinion.</i>

08:35.342 --> 08:36.542
Your Honor,

08:36.544 --> 08:39.812
if being an asshole
was a criminal offense,

08:39.813 --> 08:41.948
I'd say lock Mr. Zielinski up.

08:41.950 --> 08:44.384
In fact, if they want
to call him that, be my guest.

08:44.386 --> 08:48.054
But they better use the word
"opinion," like he did,

08:48.056 --> 08:51.024
because unless I woke up
this morning in Nazi Germany,

08:51.026 --> 08:52.792
that's my client's right.

08:52.794 --> 08:55.228
- Nazi Germany?
- Making a point.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.596
<i>Ja, gut</i> one.

08:56.598 --> 08:57.997
Your Honor, his client
blatantly declares

08:57.999 --> 09:01.334
his rants are
merely his opinions

09:01.336 --> 09:04.037
for the sole purpose
of skirting libel law.

09:04.039 --> 09:05.938
I drive 65
for the sole purpose

09:05.940 --> 09:07.206
of avoiding
a speeding ticket.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.741
Doesn't make me a criminal.

09:08.743 --> 09:11.411
But Mr. Specter doesn't have
malice against other drivers.

09:11.413 --> 09:13.746
- What does he have?
- I don't know.

09:13.748 --> 09:14.747
Your Honor, we have
a little recording

09:14.749 --> 09:17.016
of Mr. Zielinski
of our own.

09:17.018 --> 09:19.218
This is what Mr. Zielinski
sounds like

09:19.220 --> 09:21.220
when he doesn't know
the cameras are rolling.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.892
Solis? The guy is
a goddamn fraud.

09:25.894 --> 09:27.393
He's juicing, I know it.

09:27.395 --> 09:30.296
I don't care what evidence
he or the league claim to have.

09:30.298 --> 09:32.365
When I say things,
people listen,

09:32.367 --> 09:34.834
and I'm gonna run his ass
out of the game.

09:34.836 --> 09:37.904
- Your Honor--
- Save it, Mr. Specter.

09:37.906 --> 09:40.940
Case goes to trial.

09:43.877 --> 09:45.578
You really only drive 65?

09:45.580 --> 09:47.013
In a school zone.

09:47.015 --> 09:48.614
Solis doesn't need the money.
What do you want?

09:48.616 --> 09:51.250
Three years' worth
of random tests by the league

09:51.252 --> 09:53.753
plus independent tests
we had run to quash the rumors.

09:53.755 --> 09:56.522
As you can see,
my client is clean.

09:56.524 --> 09:59.125
- Zielinski doesn't have these.
- Oh, he does, and I know it

09:59.127 --> 10:00.760
because we sent them to him.

10:00.762 --> 10:03.362
But he chooses not
to reveal them on his show.

10:03.364 --> 10:05.031
What if I get him
to air these results

10:05.033 --> 10:06.132
plus your side of the story?

10:06.134 --> 10:08.334
Too late for that.

10:08.336 --> 10:09.936
We want an apology
from your client.

10:09.938 --> 10:11.270
In person?

10:11.272 --> 10:13.005
Nice try.

10:13.007 --> 10:15.074
We want an on-air
complete retraction,

10:15.076 --> 10:18.077
and that's non-negotiable.

10:25.919 --> 10:28.287
Louis.

10:28.289 --> 10:29.455
Hi, Donna.

10:29.457 --> 10:31.524
I heard you were back.
I am.

10:31.526 --> 10:34.627
Yeah, see that.

10:34.629 --> 10:36.095
Look, you know, I, um...

10:36.097 --> 10:37.797
I never--
I never wanted to--

10:37.799 --> 10:40.800
To...what?

10:40.802 --> 10:44.036
I never wanted
to do what I did.

10:44.038 --> 10:48.007
And I-I just
don't have the words...

10:48.009 --> 10:50.710
Find them.

10:53.413 --> 10:57.583
I'm sorry.

10:57.585 --> 11:01.587
I'm so, <i>so</i> sorry.

11:06.493 --> 11:08.494
Then let us never
speak of it again.

11:11.198 --> 11:12.732
Mm...
you're kidding, right?

11:12.734 --> 11:14.133
Did you mean
what you just said?

11:14.135 --> 11:16.335
- Pfft, and more.
- Then it's done.

11:16.337 --> 11:18.704
- No, it isn't.
- Did you hear what I just--

11:18.706 --> 11:23.543
Season pass, Lincoln Center,
front row every show.

11:23.545 --> 11:24.710
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:24.712 --> 11:26.546
- Do I have to go with you?
- Hell no.

11:26.548 --> 11:30.550
- Thank you, Louis.
- You are welcome.

11:30.552 --> 11:32.218
God, could this day
get any better?

11:32.220 --> 11:33.619
"Any better"?

11:33.621 --> 11:34.720
What was so good
about it before?

11:34.722 --> 11:36.155
- Huh, what happened?
- Something.

11:36.157 --> 11:38.291
Nothing, no, can't I
just be glad you're back?

11:38.293 --> 11:40.660
You look like
you have 80 teeth.

11:40.662 --> 11:43.896
What kind of suit is that?
Brioni. Why?

11:43.898 --> 11:46.332
Oh, shit.

11:50.370 --> 11:51.938
Welcome back, Donna.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.573
Thank you, but there's
something I need to tell you.

11:53.575 --> 11:56.142
- No need to apologize.
- Uh, that's not what it is.

11:56.144 --> 11:57.343
You're not
getting a raise.

11:57.345 --> 12:01.080
Daniel just made Louis
senior partner.

12:01.082 --> 12:02.682
How do you know?

12:02.684 --> 12:04.784
Four years ago, Norma told me
that Louis had a suit

12:04.786 --> 12:07.320
picked out for the day
he made senior partner.

12:07.322 --> 12:09.455
He is wearing it.
Son of a bitch.

12:09.457 --> 12:10.723
Hardman bought another vote.

12:10.725 --> 12:11.724
What are you gonna
do about it?

12:11.726 --> 12:14.393
Get it back.

12:14.395 --> 12:16.028
Donna...
Yes?

12:16.030 --> 12:17.163
How'd the suit look?

12:17.165 --> 12:19.332
Dated.

12:19.334 --> 12:21.167
Thank you.

12:21.169 --> 12:23.169
Can't believe that asshole
put us in this pickle.

12:23.171 --> 12:24.337
I'd think
you'd admire him.

12:24.339 --> 12:25.738
He's cleaning up
the game you love.

12:25.740 --> 12:29.041
He's been throwing accusations
around with no proof,

12:29.043 --> 12:30.676
and I've had about
enough of that lately.

12:30.678 --> 12:32.445
Well, proof or no proof,
anybody can see

12:32.447 --> 12:33.679
that Solis is juicing.

12:33.681 --> 12:35.381
That's not
what those tests say.

12:35.383 --> 12:37.817
People can find ways
to pass tests, trust me.

12:37.819 --> 12:40.620
Michael!

12:40.622 --> 12:44.624
Grammy?
Rachel. Oh, no.

12:44.626 --> 12:45.725
Um, Harvey...

12:45.727 --> 12:47.293
This is
your famous grandmother?

12:47.295 --> 12:49.161
Oh, you were right.
He is sharp.

12:49.163 --> 12:51.797
What are you doing here?

12:51.799 --> 12:54.333
Mr. Specter,
pleasure to meet you.

12:54.335 --> 12:56.535
Your grandson says
nice things about you.

12:56.537 --> 12:59.405
Oh, he tells me
you're quite the hardass.

12:59.407 --> 13:01.641
<i>Can</i> be a hardass.

13:01.643 --> 13:03.309
"Hardass" isn't
really the word he uses.

13:03.311 --> 13:06.279
Okay, grammy,
I see lip runs in the family.

13:06.281 --> 13:08.848
It's nice meeting you.

13:08.850 --> 13:11.918
Yeah, um...
what are you doing here?

13:11.920 --> 13:14.153
And--and--and why
are you in Rachel's office?

13:14.155 --> 13:15.354
Oh, we bumped into each other
downstairs in the lobby.

13:15.356 --> 13:17.256
I thought we could eat.

13:17.258 --> 13:20.660
Might as well have brought it
to me in <i>Star Wars</i> lunchbox.

13:20.662 --> 13:23.029
Don't give me lip, Michael.
It's been two months.

13:23.031 --> 13:25.698
I thought maybe you'd want
to see I'm still alive.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.434
She's got
a point,<i>Michael.</i>

13:28.436 --> 13:31.671
Plus I wanted to meet
the people you work with.

13:31.673 --> 13:33.272
Like Rachel.

13:33.274 --> 13:35.207
She's even more lovely
than you said.

13:35.209 --> 13:37.043
- "Lovely"?
- Okay, we're done here.

13:37.045 --> 13:38.477
Bye, dear.

13:38.479 --> 13:40.246
I hope to see you again soon.
Me too.

13:40.248 --> 13:42.348
It was lovely
to meet you.

13:44.351 --> 13:45.584
Okay, did you really

13:45.586 --> 13:47.553
have to tell Rachel
that I said she was hot?

13:47.555 --> 13:52.258
Oh, fine, just let me meet
that Harold clown, and I'll go.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.834
You planned this whole thing
from the beginning, didn't you?

14:01.836 --> 14:03.235
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:03.237 --> 14:05.104
You got Hanson
that job at justice.

14:05.106 --> 14:06.272
It was a loss for us,

14:06.274 --> 14:08.474
but a gain for justice,
don't you think?

14:08.476 --> 14:11.277
And making Louis Litt
a senior partner behind my back.

14:11.279 --> 14:14.280
Is that all part
of the new Daniel Hardman

14:14.282 --> 14:16.248
era of transparency?

14:16.250 --> 14:17.483
It's within my rights

14:17.485 --> 14:19.719
according to
the bylaws you wrote.

14:19.721 --> 14:25.091
Ah, yes, and how much
did buying his vote cost you?

14:25.093 --> 14:26.292
Cost me?

14:26.294 --> 14:29.862
It was earned years ago.

14:29.864 --> 14:33.165
And your failure to promote him
is a perfect example

14:33.167 --> 14:35.634
of how your judgment
has harmed this firm.

14:35.636 --> 14:38.571
My judgment
and my discretion

14:38.573 --> 14:40.639
are the only reasons
your ass didn't end up

14:40.641 --> 14:41.974
in jail five years ago.

14:41.976 --> 14:44.110
It wasn't discretion,
it was self-interest.

14:44.112 --> 14:46.212
You ousted me
and got the firm.

14:46.214 --> 14:50.950
- I saved you and got the firm.
- You did.

14:50.952 --> 14:53.219
But you didn't steal the ball
from me five years ago.

14:53.221 --> 14:55.021
I dropped it.

14:55.023 --> 14:58.791
My lieutenant was all
you were ever meant to be.

15:00.427 --> 15:03.195
I'm going
to offer you a deal.

15:03.197 --> 15:05.765
Take Porter, Feldman,
Gallagher...

15:05.767 --> 15:08.834
I'll let you walk away,
set up shop wherever you like.

15:08.836 --> 15:11.704
I'll waive
the non-compete.

15:11.706 --> 15:13.105
You don't
have the votes.

15:13.107 --> 15:14.774
I put you out once.

15:14.776 --> 15:16.575
When I beat you this time,

15:16.577 --> 15:18.444
they're gonna have
to peel you off the wall.

15:18.446 --> 15:20.613
It's nice to see you

15:20.615 --> 15:22.715
doing your own dirty work
for a change.

15:22.717 --> 15:25.951
Unfortunately, this time,
you can't have Harvey threaten

15:25.953 --> 15:28.487
to tell my dying wife
or my teenage daughter

15:28.489 --> 15:31.257
about my indiscretions.

15:31.259 --> 15:36.162
You didn't even know
about Sarah, did you?

15:36.164 --> 15:37.496
He did what
I told him to do.

15:37.498 --> 15:42.735
No. You can't even control
your own attack dog.

15:42.737 --> 15:44.403
Well, get this.

15:44.405 --> 15:47.139
I wasn't even planning on
coming back after Alicia died.

15:47.141 --> 15:49.341
Then you sent him,
and I had no choice.

15:49.343 --> 15:51.010
Bullshit.

15:51.012 --> 15:52.278
You do what
you want to do.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.780
You always have,
and you always will.

15:54.782 --> 15:59.151
Well, water
under the bridge.

15:59.153 --> 16:02.655
We are where we are.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.957
And I like where I am.

16:04.959 --> 16:08.994
And we'll see who peels whom
off the wall.

16:17.342 --> 16:18.976
Let me
get this straight.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.279
You realized that Daniel
was pulling a move,

16:21.281 --> 16:22.647
and you confronted him?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.849
How many times have you told me
not to poke the bear?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.217
I didn't just poke.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.185
I made him an offer.
Which he refused.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.920
And now he knows
we're on to Louis.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.822
If I lose this thing
because of Louis Litt--

16:31.824 --> 16:33.824
You're not losing.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.726
You have a card to play
that Hardman doesn't have.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.029
- No, no.
- Yes.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.064
Partner bonuses
haven't gone out yet.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.166
I'm not using the bonuses
to buy people off.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.835
You might be ethically
against playing politics

16:44.837 --> 16:46.704
with our firm's money,
but he isn't.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.205
This isn't about ethics.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.241
If I give Louis
an extra $100,000,

16:50.243 --> 16:53.010
how's that gonna play
with Gallo, Klyman, Reeger?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.613
Then do what Daniel did.
Make another senior partner.

16:55.615 --> 16:59.016
We get one each per year.
I named you.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.986
Read the bylaws
just once.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.954
You've got
to be kidding me.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.589
Louis is going to be
the deciding vote.

17:06.592 --> 17:10.761
And he better vote
for me.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.730
- No, no!
- Yes.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.964
Harvey, this is
your chance to prove

17:13.965 --> 17:15.800
you learned something
from that mess you made

17:15.801 --> 17:17.935
with Paul Porter.
I have nothing to offer him.

17:17.936 --> 17:20.404
Harvey, you've treated that
man like shit at every turn.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.473
You are the thorn
in his side.

17:22.474 --> 17:25.476
It is time that
you pull that thorn out.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.954
Here are
your interrogatories.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.190
- Thank you.
- Oh, and remember, Michael,

17:39.192 --> 17:42.226
you have to finish your homework
before you can watch TV.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.427
Oh, right, because
my grandmother brought me lunch,

17:43.429 --> 17:44.862
that makes me...
A little boy.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.497
And this is
really fun for you.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.632
It really kind of is.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.634
Are you thinking
about moving?

17:50.636 --> 17:53.237
Uh, no, actually I was
looking into getting

17:53.239 --> 17:55.673
a place in Manhattan
for my lunch lady.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.509
- You'd really do that for her?
- I am doing it.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.278
It doesn't even come close
to paying her back

18:01.280 --> 18:05.049
for everything
she's done for me.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.618
That's, um...

18:07.620 --> 18:09.720
that's really amazing,
Mike.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.921
You wanna know
what's amazing?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.124
- What?
- This place.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.459
Right here,
check it out.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.328
It's pretty sweet, right?
Off 10th Avenue.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.429
Mmhmm.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.663
Does it come
with a bulletproof vest?

18:19.665 --> 18:23.667
Um...okay.

18:23.669 --> 18:24.802
There, how about this one?

18:24.804 --> 18:27.104
- A six floor walk-up.
- Great views.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.408
Move over.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.143
Okay.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.082
Wait a minute.
Yeah?

18:38.084 --> 18:40.317
You set all this up,
so I'd help, didn't you?

18:40.319 --> 18:41.786
Oh, I may
be a little boy,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.721
but I'm not
a stupid little boy.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.290
- You're a sneaky little boy.
- Show me another.

18:49.728 --> 18:53.731
Partner, senior partner--
it all sounds the same to me.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.900
No, Mom, how many times
do I have to tell you?

18:55.902 --> 18:58.302
Senior partner
<i>is</i> the inner circle.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.938
It just makes you sound
like an old man.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.206
Stop it.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.774
And what would you know
about it, Dad?

19:03.776 --> 19:05.476
Well, you are
losing your hair.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.012
- It's the cut.
- It is not the cut.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.380
It's the cut!

19:09.382 --> 19:10.514
And by the way, Dad,
if you're not going to bother

19:10.516 --> 19:11.882
to figure out
where the camera is,

19:11.884 --> 19:13.551
maybe you should
put some freaking pants on.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.520
I know where the camera is.
I'm not ashamed of my body.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.523
If you felt the same way,
maybe there'd be a Mrs. Litt.

19:19.525 --> 19:22.993
Louie, I don't want to die
before I see my grandchildren.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.328
Mom, you have
two grandchildren.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.664
Esther's children
are not Litts!

19:26.666 --> 19:27.865
Is that your mom
and dad on there?

19:27.867 --> 19:29.166
Get out, Harvey,
I'm Skyping.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.268
Is that Harvey Specter?
Let me speak to him.

19:31.270 --> 19:35.206
It is about time
I met your best friend...

19:35.208 --> 19:36.407
Was that your mom and dad?

19:36.409 --> 19:40.578
What's up?
No.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.179
What's this?

19:42.181 --> 19:45.349
The address of my tailor.
Donna said you asked for it.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.986
And what would
really happen to me

19:48.988 --> 19:50.621
if I show up
at that address?

19:50.623 --> 19:53.424
You get a nice suit,
one that you could wear tonight

19:53.426 --> 19:55.025
when I take you out
to dinner.

19:55.027 --> 19:59.263
Donna.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.464
What's the fun
of being senior partner

20:00.466 --> 20:02.032
if you have
to keep it a secret?

20:02.034 --> 20:04.435
And why exactly
should I dine with you?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.403
Because you've been waiting
a long time for this,

20:06.405 --> 20:08.706
and I want
to congratulate you.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.642
You want to congratulate me
on becoming your peer.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.877
- Yes.
- Say it.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.378
I'm your peer.
You're my peer.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.113
- We're exactly the same.
- We're exactly the same.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.314
If two girls saw us
walking down the street,

20:17.316 --> 20:18.449
they'd say, "hey,
those guys are twins.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.984
Identical."
Okay, I'm cancelling.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.386
Okay, no, I'm in.
I'm in.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.787
I'm in.
What time?

20:23.789 --> 20:25.055
7:30.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.056
Are you gonna
be there at 7:30?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.359
Yep.

20:32.797 --> 20:34.765
Donna tells the woman,
"I don't care who you are,

20:34.767 --> 20:36.066
you're not getting
my grapefruit."

20:36.068 --> 20:37.635
- Then what did you do?
- What could I do?

20:37.637 --> 20:39.637
I gave her <i>my</i> grapefruit.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.673
Thank you.
This is great, Harvey.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.108
We're like two fingers
on the same hand.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.043
As long as
I'm the index.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.144
I'm serious,
this is nice, you know?

20:47.146 --> 20:50.281
Colleagues.
Equals.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.582
Friends.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.485
Well, as a friend,

20:54.487 --> 20:55.786
I want you
to see something.

20:55.788 --> 20:59.123
What do you got?

20:59.125 --> 21:00.991
Five years ago,
I asked you for help

21:00.993 --> 21:02.226
to look
into another firm's books.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.862
Well, they were our books.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.733
I helped you prove
Hardman was embezzling.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.036
You also tried
to set up a fall guy.

21:14.839 --> 21:16.440
Me.

21:16.442 --> 21:20.177
"A schmuck," I believe, was
the term you used at the time.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.512
This was five years ago,

21:21.514 --> 21:23.080
and you're just getting around
to telling me now?

21:23.082 --> 21:24.315
I wonder why that is.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.483
I didn't see the need
for you to be hurt.

21:26.485 --> 21:28.018
Right, 'cause
I'm your friend.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.887
A friend
tells you the truth,

21:29.889 --> 21:33.023
and the truth is, Hardman
used you to hide his embezzling,

21:33.025 --> 21:35.125
and he's using you again.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.126
And how exactly
is that different from

21:36.128 --> 21:37.361
what you're doing
right now?

21:37.363 --> 21:38.696
You can't trust him.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.763
But I can trust you?

21:39.765 --> 21:42.099
- Yes, you can.
- Oh, please.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.134
Did I tell Jessica about
your little dictaphone maneuver?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.836
No, you know what you did?
You lorded it over my head,

21:45.838 --> 21:47.538
said that I'd owe you,
and now you've come to collect.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.772
Well, you know what?
Go ahead.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.874
Run to mommy.
Tattle.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.076
I mean, this was
about my vote?

21:52.078 --> 21:53.377
If I do
vote for Daniel,

21:53.379 --> 21:55.079
what is Jessica
gonna do about it?

22:06.042 --> 22:07.741
I found this one
that faces away from Lex,

22:07.743 --> 22:09.043
so she won't get
all the street noise,

22:09.045 --> 22:10.444
and I checked
into the doormen.

22:10.446 --> 22:12.613
Raul's been here 14 years,
and Jimbo 17.

22:12.615 --> 22:14.181
Jimbo?

22:14.183 --> 22:15.783
People open up to me.

22:15.785 --> 22:18.786
So what do you think?

22:18.788 --> 22:21.989
I think...

22:21.991 --> 22:23.490
Grammy's gonna love it
when I tell her

22:23.492 --> 22:26.126
she has a new place
to live tonight.

22:26.128 --> 22:31.432
Come on, you haven't
even seen the bedroom yet.

22:31.434 --> 22:32.800
- Holy shit.
- I know.

22:32.802 --> 22:34.034
It's perfect, right?

22:34.036 --> 22:35.502
All you need are
some new curtains right here.

22:35.504 --> 22:38.205
No, the first thing I would
do is put down a nice rug.

22:38.207 --> 22:39.740
You wanna cover
the hardwood?

22:39.742 --> 22:42.576
- Not all of it.
- So you mean an area rug.

22:42.578 --> 22:46.513
No, I mean, cover an area
of the hardwood with a rug.

22:46.515 --> 22:48.182
I can live with that.
Like an 8x10 Sisal.

22:48.184 --> 22:50.918
- A whatsal?
- The beige, scratchy kind.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.319
A scratchy rug
defeats

22:52.321 --> 22:53.587
it wasn't my idea
in the first place.

22:53.589 --> 22:54.989
Fair enough,
but the bed--

22:54.991 --> 22:56.657
The bed goes here.

22:56.659 --> 22:58.092
Oh, my God,
you're such a guy.

22:58.094 --> 23:00.094
If the bed doesn't go here,

23:00.096 --> 23:01.862
then what's the point
of even having the window?

23:01.864 --> 23:03.197
Yeah, but your curtains
cover up the light anyway.

23:03.199 --> 23:04.298
No, that would be shades,

23:04.300 --> 23:06.767
which this room
will never, ever have.

23:06.769 --> 23:09.069
Look, just come
right here.

23:09.071 --> 23:12.640
See what I mean?

23:14.175 --> 23:16.176
Beautiful.

23:22.117 --> 23:24.218
I should go meet Harvey.
It's really hot in here.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.220
Yeah.

23:28.823 --> 23:30.324
Nice of you to make it.

23:30.326 --> 23:31.892
Sorry, I had
this thing with Rachel.

23:31.894 --> 23:34.628
Oh, a date.
Isn't that special?

23:34.630 --> 23:37.331
Not as special
as your date last night.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.832
So how is Louis?
What did he wear?

23:38.834 --> 23:40.734
Did you get any?
Shut me down.

23:40.736 --> 23:42.069
What?

23:42.071 --> 23:43.671
This is serious.
What are we gonna do?

23:43.673 --> 23:45.239
I don't know,
but I'll tell you one thing--

23:45.241 --> 23:47.608
I'm not taking
no for an answer.

23:47.610 --> 23:50.544
No way! You want me
to apologize on the air?

23:50.546 --> 23:52.146
Why don't I
just drop my pants

23:52.148 --> 23:54.448
and paint a clown on my ass?
Save that for sweeps.

23:54.450 --> 23:56.283
I have a reputation,
Mr. Specter.

23:56.285 --> 23:57.885
And by the way,
I don't appreciate

23:57.887 --> 23:59.353
you bashing it in court.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.255
Look, I went to court
to win the case,

24:01.257 --> 24:03.123
not protect your reputation.

24:03.125 --> 24:04.692
Yeah, well, turns out
you didn't do either one.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.161
Here's a suggestion.

24:07.163 --> 24:08.595
Next time, make sure
you're actually off the air

24:08.597 --> 24:09.930
before shooting
your mouth off.

24:09.932 --> 24:12.466
I stand by what I said.

24:12.468 --> 24:14.201
Solis is doping.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.303
Roger Maris got
an asterisk next to his name.

24:16.305 --> 24:18.972
This guy deserves
an asterisk next to his name,

24:18.974 --> 24:20.841
and I want him
out of the league.

24:20.843 --> 24:22.343
You're not
the commissioner of baseball.

24:22.345 --> 24:24.311
Yeah, well, the commissioner
could never get my ratings.

24:24.313 --> 24:25.879
- Mr. Zielinski--
- See, finally,

24:25.881 --> 24:26.914
someone who treats me
with respect.

24:26.916 --> 24:28.182
We can't claim

24:28.184 --> 24:29.450
that you're just
offering up opinions anymore.

24:29.452 --> 24:31.085
If you don't apologize,
we have to show

24:31.087 --> 24:33.654
that you have a factual basis
for accusing Solis of doping.

24:33.656 --> 24:35.622
- Of course I did.
- Then give us your source.

24:35.624 --> 24:36.724
What kind of career
do you think

24:36.726 --> 24:38.058
I'd have if I give that up?

24:38.060 --> 24:39.693
I'll tell you what--
nonexistent.

24:39.695 --> 24:40.928
Exactly like your source.

24:40.930 --> 24:42.663
- Harvey, please, could--
- That's it.

24:42.665 --> 24:43.964
Instead of bugging me
to give up my guy

24:43.966 --> 24:45.299
after I already
told you no,

24:45.301 --> 24:48.869
why don't you do your damn job
and win this case?

24:52.073 --> 24:55.376
Well, looks like good cop,
bad cop didn't work.

24:55.378 --> 24:58.812
- Actually it did...on me.
- What are you talking about?

24:58.814 --> 25:01.215
If he's full of shit
and has no source,

25:01.217 --> 25:03.917
he knows this eventually
goes against him in court.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.287
I think Solis is doping.
Welcome to the party.

25:07.289 --> 25:09.189
And Zielinski may have
some integrity.

25:09.191 --> 25:11.692
I thought you said
he was a dick.

25:11.694 --> 25:13.660
If he's actually
protecting his source,

25:13.662 --> 25:15.429
he's a dick with a code.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.364
His code
is our problem.

25:17.366 --> 25:19.566
If we can't find that source,
we can't fix it.

25:19.568 --> 25:20.968
Forget the source.

25:20.970 --> 25:23.070
We need to figure out
how Solis passed those tests.

25:23.072 --> 25:24.438
How are we
supposed to do that?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.140
Not us, you.

25:26.142 --> 25:28.108
I'm like Zielinski,
you're like Solis.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.778
- An all-star.
- A cheater.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.179
You're not gonna
tell the bar association

25:32.181 --> 25:34.715
that I deserve
an asterisk, are you?

25:34.717 --> 25:37.084
You just gave me
a good idea.

25:37.086 --> 25:39.386
I hope it doesn't involve
you telling the bar association

25:39.388 --> 25:41.388
that I deserve an asterisk.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.396
Oh, a bat.

25:49.398 --> 25:51.965
What, are you gonna hit me
if I don't vote for Jessica?

25:51.967 --> 25:54.735
No, I just wanted you to hear
a story before you decided.

25:54.737 --> 25:57.171
Ah.

25:57.173 --> 25:58.972
More dirt on Hardman.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.307
The story's
about Roger Maris.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.009
Yeah, what,
did he work for Hardman?

26:04.746 --> 26:06.780
He used to play
for the Yankees.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.482
He beat Babe Ruth's
home run record

26:08.484 --> 26:10.751
with this bat.
You brought a prop.

26:10.753 --> 26:12.052
That's really cute.

26:12.054 --> 26:13.987
Maris did it
in a longer season,

26:13.989 --> 26:16.390
so no one really
gave him credit for it,

26:16.392 --> 26:18.892
and it went down in
people's minds with an asterisk.

26:18.894 --> 26:22.262
I see, so it's a parable.
How literary of you.

26:22.264 --> 26:24.398
Becoming senior partner
is your life's work, Louis.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.999
You really want to buy it
with your vote?

26:26.001 --> 26:29.002
Daniel did not condition
my partnership on anything.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.437
Maybe, but it'll always
have an asterisk.

26:30.439 --> 26:31.638
You know what?
It's like you just

26:31.640 --> 26:34.408
can't fathom that
I actually earned it.

26:34.410 --> 26:36.944
Whether you earned it or not,
that's not the point.

26:36.946 --> 26:38.212
It's everything.

26:38.214 --> 26:40.447
All I am saying is,
you vote for Hardman,

26:40.449 --> 26:42.783
everyone will see this
as quid pro quo.

26:42.785 --> 26:44.184
Yeah, because
you're gonna tell them.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.686
No, I won't tell them.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.188
They'll wonder about it
all on their own,

26:48.190 --> 26:49.323
just like you will.

26:49.325 --> 26:52.326
Do me a favor
right no..

26:54.395 --> 26:56.063
Take your bat and go.

26:56.065 --> 26:58.065
Go.

27:00.668 --> 27:03.103
Louis...

27:03.105 --> 27:04.505
you were right
at dinner.

27:04.507 --> 27:07.574
I was using you,
and I was wrong.

27:07.576 --> 27:09.243
But this decision,

27:09.245 --> 27:12.145
it isn't about me.

27:12.147 --> 27:15.148
You came up under Hardman.
You hated him.

27:15.150 --> 27:19.052
You always hated him.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.255
Don't let him
do this to you.

27:21.257 --> 27:22.756
What's my alternative,
Harvey?

27:22.758 --> 27:24.391
Jessica didn't even
have the courtesy

27:24.393 --> 27:26.960
to court my vote herself.

27:26.962 --> 27:30.430
So she sends you.
Well, guess what.

27:30.432 --> 27:31.932
You failed.

27:31.934 --> 27:34.434
So go back right now.
You tell her,

27:34.436 --> 27:36.737
Harvey Specter,
the great closer,

27:36.739 --> 27:39.573
couldn't close me.

28:00.695 --> 28:02.529
Aren't you supposed to be off
accepting the award

28:02.531 --> 28:04.031
for world's best grandson?

28:04.033 --> 28:06.600
Uh, I had to cancel.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.802
Weren't you taking her
to dinner

28:08.804 --> 28:10.270
to tell her about the apartment
you bought for her

28:10.272 --> 28:11.638
to make up
for the fact that

28:11.640 --> 28:12.673
you don't have time
to take her to dinner anymore?

28:12.675 --> 28:13.840
For your information,

28:13.842 --> 28:17.010
she was happy when
I called to reschedule.

28:17.012 --> 28:18.445
Happy to be stood up.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.347
Happy that I have
a job that fully engages me.

28:20.349 --> 28:23.383
There was a time she was
worried that wouldn't happen.

28:23.385 --> 28:25.852
Despite Harvard Law School?

28:27.755 --> 28:29.523
No, I mean,
when I was younger.

28:29.525 --> 28:31.224
She's right that
you're really lucky

28:31.226 --> 28:33.627
you get to do something
that challenges you.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.228
I hope
I have that someday.

28:35.230 --> 28:37.497
Rachel, I told you,
whenever you want help with--

28:37.499 --> 28:40.867
holy shit,
you took the LSAT--

28:40.869 --> 28:42.302
you took the LSATs?

28:42.304 --> 28:44.037
I did.

28:44.039 --> 28:45.872
How did you do?

28:45.874 --> 28:47.841
Um...
I don't know.

28:47.843 --> 28:49.376
Rachel, you already
did the hard part.

28:49.378 --> 28:52.212
You took the test.
Opening the envelope is easy.

28:52.214 --> 28:53.480
No, every other time
I've had to open the envelope--

28:53.482 --> 28:55.215
This isn't
every other time.

28:57.019 --> 28:58.852
Do you want me
to open it?

28:58.854 --> 29:01.421
- No.
- Yes, you do.

29:01.423 --> 29:04.658
Okay, um,
if I score below 160,

29:04.660 --> 29:07.060
then I just want you
to throw it away.

29:07.062 --> 29:09.529
And don't tell me.
I don't want to know, okay?

29:09.531 --> 29:13.166
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:16.104 --> 29:20.374
- Um...Rachel, I'm...
- Okay.

29:23.445 --> 29:25.445
172.

29:27.949 --> 29:29.583
- 172?
- You got a 172.

29:29.585 --> 29:31.251
- Oh, my--I did?
- Yes.

29:31.253 --> 29:33.186
That's--oh, oh, my God!

29:33.188 --> 29:35.889
Oh, my God, don't you ever
do that to me again.

29:35.891 --> 29:38.091
Rachel, you're
gonna be a lawyer.

29:39.461 --> 29:40.727
Look, look at it.
Oh, my God.

29:40.729 --> 29:42.396
Go.

29:42.398 --> 29:45.766
Bam.
Oh, my God.

29:45.768 --> 29:47.100
I'm gonna
be out of a job.

29:53.196 --> 29:54.562
Harvey, I think
I found something.

29:54.564 --> 29:56.197
And by "something,"
I assume you mean

29:56.199 --> 29:58.666
how Solis was cheating.
Um, maybe,

29:58.668 --> 30:00.868
but I definitely figured out
who Zielinski's source is.

30:00.870 --> 30:02.136
Well, that counts
as something.

30:02.138 --> 30:03.437
They used a hot mic,
I used a hot mic.

30:03.439 --> 30:04.572
What are you talking about?

30:04.574 --> 30:05.940
I found some footage
from a segment

30:05.942 --> 30:07.775
that Zielinski taped
at spring training.

30:07.777 --> 30:10.077
Uh, the crew is setting up,
he's in the background,

30:10.079 --> 30:11.279
having a very
intense conversation

30:11.281 --> 30:13.848
with Ruben Hernandez.

30:13.850 --> 30:17.418
Mediocre catcher. So?
Zielinski's a sportscaster.

30:17.420 --> 30:19.420
Talking to athletes
is what he does all day.

30:19.422 --> 30:22.290
This conversation
took place in Winter Park.

30:22.292 --> 30:24.325
Hernandez should have been
practicing with his team in...

30:24.327 --> 30:25.393
St. Pete.

30:25.395 --> 30:26.494
He never should have
been there.

30:26.496 --> 30:27.695
Then I remembered
the roster of

30:27.697 --> 30:29.363
every single team
Solis ever played on.

30:29.365 --> 30:31.165
- They never played together.
- Wrong, they did.

30:31.167 --> 30:34.602
Ten games, three years ago,
Hernandez's rookie year.

30:34.604 --> 30:36.671
So he got Hernandez
to take the test for him.

30:36.673 --> 30:37.838
Or at least
approached him

30:37.840 --> 30:39.974
because Zielinski's accusations
began

30:39.976 --> 30:41.776
one week after
that tape that I watched.

30:41.778 --> 30:43.144
Enough time
for Zielinski

30:43.146 --> 30:44.879
to look into
whatever Hernandez told him.

30:44.881 --> 30:47.982
And call him six times from
a company-issued cell phone.

30:47.984 --> 30:49.984
Boom!

30:49.986 --> 30:52.687
Look at you! Hot mic,
using their tricks against them.

30:52.689 --> 30:54.121
Yeah, it's what we do,
no big deal.

30:54.123 --> 30:55.723
Remind me to stop
teaching you my tricks.

30:55.725 --> 30:57.024
Well, you're gonna need
one of your tricks

30:57.026 --> 30:58.893
because what good does
Zielinski's source do us

30:58.895 --> 31:00.294
if he's not going
to let us go public?

31:00.296 --> 31:01.963
Who says we have
to go public?

31:01.965 --> 31:03.965
Here's what
I need you to do.

31:05.801 --> 31:09.704
I couldn't close him.

31:09.706 --> 31:10.938
Are you trying
to tell me

31:10.940 --> 31:13.174
you couldn't be nice
to Louis even for this?

31:13.176 --> 31:15.076
No, I'm not.

31:15.078 --> 31:17.211
You said
I'm a thorn in his side.

31:17.213 --> 31:19.246
I tried to take it out,
but you're the one

31:19.248 --> 31:20.848
who's had what he's
wanted all these years

31:20.850 --> 31:23.484
and didn't give it to him.
Senior partnership.

31:23.486 --> 31:25.119
You need to tell him
he deserves it.

31:25.121 --> 31:26.420
That's what
I sent you to do.

31:26.422 --> 31:29.757
He needs to hear it
from you.

31:29.759 --> 31:32.259
You know, I send you to do
this one thing and you can't--

31:34.097 --> 31:36.230
Fine, I'll talk to him.

31:36.232 --> 31:37.531
Wait a minute.

31:37.533 --> 31:40.901
You know him.
You knew this.

31:40.903 --> 31:43.270
This is where
it always ended up.

31:44.873 --> 31:47.074
- You got me.
- Why send me first?

31:47.076 --> 31:49.677
Because if Louis didn't have
to work to get me there,

31:49.679 --> 31:51.579
he wouldn't believe me
when I went.

31:51.581 --> 31:53.080
You're playing chess

31:53.082 --> 31:54.648
while everybody else
is playing checkers.

31:54.650 --> 31:56.484
Are you just getting that,

31:56.486 --> 31:59.120
Mr. I'm-the-best-closer-
this-city's-ever-seen?

31:59.122 --> 32:01.222
Hey, you're the one
who always calls me that.

32:01.224 --> 32:03.057
Well, maybe I shouldn't.

32:03.059 --> 32:04.859
Now if you'll excuse me,

32:04.861 --> 32:07.161
I have to tell Louis he deserves
to be senior partner.

32:07.163 --> 32:10.331
You know what, I <i>am</i> the best
closer this city's ever seen,

32:10.333 --> 32:12.700
and I didn't even make a dent.
Do you have a point?

32:12.702 --> 32:14.635
He needs more than
just words.

32:14.637 --> 32:15.870
I told you,
I'm not bribing him.

32:15.872 --> 32:17.905
That's not what I meant.

32:17.907 --> 32:20.608
His anger is deep.

32:20.610 --> 32:23.444
He wants us to feel pain.
How?

32:25.514 --> 32:28.616
Give him my office.

32:28.618 --> 32:30.117
You're willing
to do that?

32:30.119 --> 32:31.652
Remember
when you questioned

32:31.654 --> 32:34.221
if I could put
your needs above mine?

32:34.223 --> 32:36.924
Here's your answer.

32:38.326 --> 32:39.660
Mr. Solis, big fan.

32:39.662 --> 32:41.595
Can I get an autograph?
Sure, buddy.

32:41.597 --> 32:44.298
Can you just sign it
"Roberto Solis, steroid user"?

32:44.300 --> 32:45.533
What?

32:45.535 --> 32:47.234
I represent
Tony Zielinski.

32:47.236 --> 32:48.569
You can't talk to me
without my lawyer.

32:48.571 --> 32:49.770
Ah, you're right,
I can't.

32:49.772 --> 32:51.906
You go ahead and turn me in.
When you do,

32:51.908 --> 32:53.574
I'll tell them all
about Zielinski's source

32:53.576 --> 32:56.110
inside your clubhouse.
Bullshit.

32:56.112 --> 32:57.344
Baseball is a brotherhood.

32:57.346 --> 32:59.146
Nobody on my team would
go public against me.

32:59.148 --> 33:03.384
But Ruben Hernandez isn't
on your team anymore.

33:03.386 --> 33:05.553
If Ruben tries ratting out
a former teammate,

33:05.555 --> 33:07.121
no ball club in this league
will forgive him.

33:07.123 --> 33:09.323
He might not have a choice
when we subpoena him.

33:09.325 --> 33:11.025
No, no way.

33:11.027 --> 33:13.527
If Zielinski's giving up Ruben,
he'd have done it already.

33:13.529 --> 33:16.430
He might not,
but I will.

33:16.432 --> 33:18.232
You're in
a rundown, Roberto.

33:18.234 --> 33:21.102
Drop the suit and announce
your retirement from baseball.

33:21.104 --> 33:23.537
- Are you out of your mind?
- You do it,

33:23.539 --> 33:26.006
Zielinski will never mention
your name on air again.

33:26.008 --> 33:28.109
You don't,
Hernandez outs you,

33:28.111 --> 33:31.512
and the whole world
knows who you are.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.521
Louis, got a minute?

33:40.523 --> 33:42.556
I'm a little busy,
but sure.

33:42.558 --> 33:44.258
I deserve that.

33:44.260 --> 33:47.995
A little payback among
senior partners is fair play.

33:47.997 --> 33:49.897
I'm listening.

33:49.899 --> 33:53.667
I'm not going to insult you
by beating around the bush,

33:53.669 --> 33:55.870
so let's talk about
the elephant in the room.

33:55.872 --> 33:57.071
What's it gonna take?

33:57.073 --> 33:59.540
My dedication to this firm
knows no limits.

33:59.542 --> 34:02.176
And what I ask in return--
all I ask in return--

34:02.178 --> 34:03.377
is to be valued,

34:03.379 --> 34:04.445
for someone
to make me believe that

34:04.447 --> 34:05.980
they think that
I'm great at what I do.

34:05.982 --> 34:07.781
Then we're all set

34:07.783 --> 34:09.116
because I've always
felt that way.

34:09.118 --> 34:10.251
That's not the way
you made it seem

34:10.253 --> 34:11.619
to everyone
at Harvey's trial.

34:11.621 --> 34:12.853
Louis, we were at trial.

34:12.855 --> 34:14.989
I was trying to make my case,
same as you.

34:17.092 --> 34:20.793
Well, you did
a good job.

34:20.795 --> 34:24.864
Because that, Jessica,
I got no trouble believing.

34:24.867 --> 34:27.034
But the Jessica that
kept stringing me along,

34:27.036 --> 34:28.601
telling me, one day,
my time would come--

34:28.603 --> 34:29.969
her, I've come to doubt.

34:29.972 --> 34:32.840
I've always been
straight with you, Louis.

34:32.842 --> 34:35.042
My message has never wavered.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.110
Does that
include the message

34:36.112 --> 34:37.178
that you sent to me
through Harvey?

34:37.179 --> 34:38.312
Harvey came to you first

34:38.313 --> 34:39.880
because I wanted you
to know

34:39.882 --> 34:41.581
that you are valuable
to both of us.

34:41.583 --> 34:44.918
No, there's only an "us"
when you want something from me.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.521
The rest of the time, it's me
on the outside, looking in.

34:47.523 --> 34:49.356
Well, you're
a senior partner now.

34:49.358 --> 34:51.158
You're as on the inside
as it gets.

34:51.159 --> 34:52.659
That's right,
thanks to Hardman.

34:52.661 --> 34:53.994
You think
he's valuing you.

34:53.996 --> 34:55.963
He's buying you...

34:55.965 --> 34:59.833
with this one thing
at this convenient time.

34:59.835 --> 35:02.903
You don't get it.
Hardman actually sees me.

35:02.905 --> 35:04.772
With you, I'll always
be this mushroom

35:04.774 --> 35:06.340
in the shadow
of Harvey's tree.

35:06.342 --> 35:07.775
What are you saying, Louis?

35:07.777 --> 35:10.244
I'm saying it's time
you put Harvey in my shadow.

35:10.246 --> 35:12.613
And how exactly
would you like me to do that?

35:12.615 --> 35:14.281
You know, I don't know.
You figure it out.

35:14.283 --> 35:15.349
Otherwise, maybe
one of these days,

35:15.351 --> 35:16.717
you'll see what
it's like to be

35:16.719 --> 35:19.253
in someone's shadow
for a while.

35:21.022 --> 35:24.058
You know what, Louis?

35:24.060 --> 35:28.596
Harvey told me that
I should give you his office,

35:28.598 --> 35:31.131
and I came in here
prepared to do just that.

35:31.133 --> 35:33.601
But I don't respond
to threats,

35:33.603 --> 35:34.868
and I'm not
going to buy your vote

35:34.870 --> 35:36.237
because that's not
who I am.

35:36.239 --> 35:38.239
But know this:

35:38.241 --> 35:40.774
I will win.

35:40.776 --> 35:43.077
And tomorrow,
after the vote,

35:43.079 --> 35:44.612
if you are
on the wrong side,

35:44.614 --> 35:48.716
there'll be no coming back.

36:10.373 --> 36:11.406
When you stole
from this firm,

36:11.407 --> 36:14.208
did you do anything
to cover your tracks?

36:15.610 --> 36:17.411
I should have known
they had this in their pocket.

36:17.413 --> 36:18.846
So you don't deny it.

36:18.848 --> 36:20.581
I wouldn't insult
your intelligence.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.384
I'm sure they came to you
armed with proof,

36:23.386 --> 36:25.152
and you followed the numbers
better than I ever could.

36:25.154 --> 36:27.354
- Why?
- The best I can offer you

36:27.356 --> 36:28.656
is that
it wasn't personal.

36:28.658 --> 36:31.592
It was just that, given
your financial expertise,

36:31.594 --> 36:33.694
I thought you
would seem plausible.

36:33.696 --> 36:35.863
"Plausible."

36:35.865 --> 36:37.431
Obviously
my plan was that

36:37.433 --> 36:40.100
nobody would notice the money
was missing in the first place.

36:40.102 --> 36:43.604
- So I was plan "B."
- I suppose so, Louis.

36:43.606 --> 36:44.772
I'm sorry.
You're sor-

36:47.243 --> 36:50.444
Do you realize you could have
destroyed my entire career?

36:50.446 --> 36:53.781
Maybe even
sent me to prison.

36:53.783 --> 36:56.383
And you know what?

36:56.385 --> 36:58.452
I didn't care.

36:58.454 --> 37:00.854
That's the truth.

37:00.856 --> 37:02.856
And you want me
to vote for you?

37:06.461 --> 37:07.628
Did you like me
back then?

37:07.630 --> 37:09.630
I didn't.

37:09.632 --> 37:12.199
The man I was five years ago
shouldn't be managing partner.

37:12.201 --> 37:14.234
He shouldn't even work here.

37:14.236 --> 37:15.903
But I'm not that man.

37:15.905 --> 37:18.172
If you think otherwise,
don't vote for me.

37:18.174 --> 37:21.241
Right.

37:21.243 --> 37:22.409
And if I don't support you,

37:22.411 --> 37:24.478
what happens
to my senior partnership?

37:24.480 --> 37:27.581
Do you think my making
you senior partner

37:27.583 --> 37:31.318
is conditioned
on my having your vote?

37:31.320 --> 37:33.754
- Wasn't it?
- Louis, I'm disappointed.

37:33.756 --> 37:38.158
I'm disappointed you think
so little of yourself.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.761
I saw the way you dominated
Jessica at Harvey's trial

37:40.763 --> 37:43.230
and lost
because of some trick.

37:43.232 --> 37:44.632
You thought I dominated?

37:44.634 --> 37:46.433
I offered you what
I thought you deserved,

37:46.435 --> 37:49.003
no more, no less.

37:49.005 --> 37:50.504
I ask for nothing
in return

37:50.506 --> 37:53.807
but that you vote
your conscience.

37:57.779 --> 38:01.215
Louis...

38:01.217 --> 38:04.218
don't doubt yourself.

38:11.559 --> 38:13.093
I've got good news.

38:13.095 --> 38:15.295
Solis has not only
agreed to drop the suit,

38:15.297 --> 38:17.765
but to retire
from the game as well.

38:17.767 --> 38:19.833
Well, maybe you're not
the asshole I thought you were.

38:19.835 --> 38:20.934
I'm not done yet.

38:20.936 --> 38:22.536
In return...

38:22.538 --> 38:25.706
you're never gonna talk
about him again on the air.

38:25.708 --> 38:28.509
So he walks away
with his reputation intact?

38:28.511 --> 38:30.411
- That's the deal.
- No, no, no, no.

38:30.413 --> 38:31.545
You know I'm right,

38:31.547 --> 38:32.813
and you want me
to step off the gas

38:32.815 --> 38:35.149
right when I got him?
Screw that.

38:35.151 --> 38:37.985
You want to know
how I know you're right?

38:37.987 --> 38:39.053
Mike?

38:39.055 --> 38:41.789
I believe you know
Ruben Hernandez.

38:41.791 --> 38:44.358
You promised you wouldn't
tell anyone I was your source.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.793
I didn't tell them.
I didn't.

38:45.795 --> 38:47.628
- Bullshit!
- Mike, get him out of here.

38:47.630 --> 38:50.631
I promise we'll fix this.
Come on.

38:50.633 --> 38:52.766
You son of a bitch, you're
supposed to be on my side.

38:52.768 --> 38:54.368
This is me
being on your side.

38:54.370 --> 38:55.936
You make me
win this in court,

38:55.938 --> 38:58.172
I'll have to do it
by making Ruben testify.

38:58.174 --> 39:00.607
So the cost of
ruining Solis' reputation

39:00.609 --> 39:02.276
will be that kid's career.

39:02.278 --> 39:05.012
And by the way, everyone will
think the same as he does.

39:05.014 --> 39:06.914
You gave him up
to save your own ass.

39:06.916 --> 39:08.215
- That's a lie.
- Doesn't matter.

39:08.217 --> 39:09.349
They'll think it anyway.

39:09.351 --> 39:11.051
But hey, that's
just one man's opinion.

39:11.053 --> 39:12.820
You want to protect
your source?

39:12.822 --> 39:14.688
Take the deal.

39:15.990 --> 39:17.524
- So?
- He took the deal.

39:17.526 --> 39:19.326
We're done with that asshole.
"Asshole"?

39:19.328 --> 39:21.929
Come on, he's just protecting
the church of baseball.

39:21.931 --> 39:22.963
You going <i>Bull Durham</i> on me?

39:22.965 --> 39:24.431
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm Tim Robbins,

39:24.433 --> 39:26.934
the hotshot pitcher
who's destined for the Majors,

39:26.936 --> 39:29.536
and you're that old man
who never really made it there.

39:29.538 --> 39:30.738
You know Robbins wore

39:30.740 --> 39:31.972
women's underwear
in that movie, right?

39:31.974 --> 39:33.407
Yeah, after he slept
with Susan Sarandon.

39:33.409 --> 39:34.742
Good one.

39:34.744 --> 39:37.244
But if you ever call
Kevin Costner an old man again,

39:37.246 --> 39:39.113
you won't get another bonus.
Okay.

39:39.115 --> 39:40.848
Whoa, my God, bonus.

39:40.850 --> 39:42.983
Harvey, I'm sorry, I've got
to go see my grandmother.

39:42.985 --> 39:46.386
Fine, go, I wouldn't want her
to think I was a hardass.

39:49.290 --> 39:50.390
Did you get rid
of that libel case?

39:50.392 --> 39:52.826
Score one
for free press.

39:52.828 --> 39:54.061
Good to see you
back in stride.

39:54.063 --> 39:56.230
When was I ever off?

39:56.232 --> 39:57.598
Jessica, do you
have a moment?

39:57.600 --> 39:59.700
Of course, Louis.
Harvey, will you give us a sec?

39:59.702 --> 40:00.934
Oh, please, what,
are you kidding?

40:00.936 --> 40:03.837
Not like there's any secrets
between you two.

40:03.839 --> 40:08.075
Well, we're listening.

40:08.077 --> 40:10.077
I'm presenting
my partnership buy-in check

40:10.079 --> 40:13.781
to you in your current capacity
as managing partner.

40:13.783 --> 40:15.415
"Current."

40:15.417 --> 40:18.051
Oh, is that your cryptic way
of asking about my vote?

40:19.487 --> 40:21.188
You kept me waiting
five years.

40:21.190 --> 40:24.525
You can wait
another 24 hours.

40:44.813 --> 40:47.514
Surprise!

40:47.516 --> 40:49.716
Rachel...hey,
what are you doing here?

40:49.718 --> 40:51.718
Come in.

40:55.156 --> 40:59.426
Mike, someone kept calling
the office for you.

40:59.428 --> 41:01.829
It was
the nursing home and...

41:01.831 --> 41:06.099
I guess--I guess that's
the emergency number they had.

41:06.101 --> 41:10.070
Um...what?

41:10.072 --> 41:13.040
It's your grandma.

41:13.042 --> 41:17.477
She passed away.

41:17.479 --> 41:20.647
No.
No, she's--

41:20.649 --> 41:23.650
I am so sorry.

41:27.155 --> 41:31.158
But...

41:31.160 --> 41:35.596
she didn't even
get to s--to see--

41:35.598 --> 41:36.697
I know.

41:36.699 --> 41:37.965
I-I'm--

41:37.967 --> 41:39.800
I'm so sorry.

41:43.105 --> 41:45.706
Wh--

41:48.510 --> 41:50.510
I'm so sorry.
