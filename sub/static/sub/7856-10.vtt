I'm not sure your welcome is shared
by everyone, you know, Father.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.158
I can only apologise.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.158
- Does your apology come
with a place to stay?
- Our car broke down.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.358
Because this clod didn't check the
engine properly, did you, son?

03:27.360 --> 03:28.918
Don't be so hard on the boy.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.440
- Where are you heading?
- Birmingham.
We've got a gig tomorrow.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.838
Well, I suppose we could find
room for you in the presbytery.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.558

sleeping on the floor...

04:26.160 --> 04:29.278
- You have got to be joking!
- It's only for one night.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.998
Where are they going to sleep?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.958
Um, the settee, the floor!

04:32.960 --> 04:36.320
- They're complete strangers.
- All the more reason
for making them welcome.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.998
Make yourself at home.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.158
Mrs McCarthy will find blankets,

04:42.160 --> 04:45.398
and I think that I've got some
spare dressing gowns somewhere

04:45.400 --> 04:47.840
because it can get quite
chilly in here at night.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.598
- Sid's on the phone to the garage
about your car.
- Grand.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.718
I heard him tutting a lot,
I wouldn't hold out much hope.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.638
So if there's anything I can do
to make your stay more comfortable?

04:59.640 --> 05:01.920
That's very kind of you,
isn't it, love?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.998
How did you two meet?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.558
KNOCK AT DOOR

05:07.560 --> 05:11.078
We were touring Haiti a couple
of months ago. Port-au-Prince.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.238
When I heard Yveline sing,
I knew we had to have her.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.078
EMMANUEL: I wonder if I could speak
to Miss Lafond.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.760
- Who?
- I believe she's here.
- Um...

05:24.840 --> 05:26.400
What are you doing here?

05:28.880 --> 05:33.278
I wanted to see with my own eyes
what this cochon has over you.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.678
Who's this?

05:34.680 --> 05:36.400
How could you?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.598
- How could you just go?
- I...

05:39.600 --> 05:42.078
No goodbye? Not to your family...

05:42.080 --> 05:44.718
Your friends... Me?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.118
What can I say?

05:46.120 --> 05:48.318
I swept her off her feet.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.198
- Now, who the hell are you?
- You must come with me.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.198
- No.
- We belong together.
- Hang on a minute, sunshine.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.638
DON'T... touch me!

05:56.640 --> 05:59.638
Let's just calm down, shall we?

05:59.640 --> 06:02.318
I don't know what it was you think
you had with Yveline,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.078
but it's over.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.600
She's mine now.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.880
In fact...

06:09.760 --> 06:11.798
..we're getting married.
- What?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.200
When did this happen?

06:14.880 --> 06:16.480
Is this true?

06:21.520 --> 06:22.918
Emmanuel...

06:22.920 --> 06:24.998
please,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.758
let me go.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.200
Baron Samdi will judge you.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.758
I take it that man
was your ex-boyfriend?

06:41.760 --> 06:43.278
Yes.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.278
He was also my houngan.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.280
- "Houngan"?
- Voodoo priest.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.478
Voodoo?!

06:49.480 --> 06:53.438
There is a saying, in Haiti
the population is 80% Catholic,

06:53.440 --> 06:55.800
20% Protestant, and 100% Voodoo.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.078
- Why didn't you tell me about him?
- I didn't think it was important.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.558
It was important enough for him

07:01.560 --> 07:04.318
to have chased you halfway
round the world.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.998
Do you still do the voodoo?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.600
I haven't given up on my faith...

07:10.320 --> 07:12.038
...Catholic or voodoo.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.758
I don't see how anyone can belong
to two religions at the same time.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.438
Voodoo's a syncretic religion -
it combines belief systems.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.560
Tommy's become quite the aficionado
since Yveline joined the band.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.358
I've got a book on it if you want.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.198
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please!

07:28.200 --> 07:30.678
Right, I've just got off
the phone to the garage.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.238
It's bad news, I'm afraid.
Your carburettor's shot.

07:33.240 --> 07:36.198
So, you'll not get that back
for at least a couple of days.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.680
- There goes our gig.
- And we're out of pocket.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.078
I wonder if there's anything
we can do to help.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.958
No of fence...

07:43.960 --> 07:46.958
I don't think jazz
is appropriate for church.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.358
- All that... swaying of hips.
- I've an idea.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.238
I've a chum who's opening
a luxury hotel.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.838
He's already booked a pianist,
but I'm sure I can persuade him

07:54.840 --> 07:56.598
to take on a few more
instrumentalists.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.958
"Luxury hotel"? I think we could
manage that.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.558
Have you got a telephone?
I'll tell them we can't make it.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.000
In the study.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.638
Well, I think you're
all missing the point -

08:07.640 --> 08:09.998
what about that mad voodoo priest?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.680
Sorry, voodoo?
Have I missed something?

08:14.200 --> 08:17.000
- Do you think Emmanuel
means to do you harm?
- No.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.040
Who is Baron Samdi?

08:23.080 --> 08:24.200
He's a Lwa.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.480
A spirit.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.400
What sort of spirit?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.120
The spirit of the dead.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.558
Apologies again.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.679
Just one of those things,
I'm afraid.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.438
I didn't say "yes".

08:48.440 --> 08:50.078
You said you'd think about it.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.038
That's not the same as a "yes"!

08:52.040 --> 08:54.038
What else you going to do?

08:54.040 --> 08:55.560
Go back to Haiti?

08:57.800 --> 08:59.438
We'll be happy.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.198
We can settle down.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.918
Have kids. Don't you want that?
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

09:03.920 --> 09:05.320
What happens to the band?

09:06.360 --> 09:08.038
When you get married?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.838
- All good things come to an end.
- Not this!

09:10.840 --> 09:12.758
This is too important.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.158
Get over it, Lloydy.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.718
It's more than music!

09:15.720 --> 09:17.358
It's what we stand for!

09:17.360 --> 09:19.198
Overcoming barriers.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.480
- What, you want to destroy that,
over some saviour kick?
- What?

09:26.280 --> 09:27.920
Everything all right?

09:28.920 --> 09:31.198
- I'm going to look for your priest.
- What?

09:31.200 --> 09:34.878
- And what do you intend to do when
you find him?
- I'll improvise, Vicar.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.680
- I insist on mediating.
- I'm coming, too.
- No, you're not.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.720
I will not be treated
like the "little woman".

09:41.720 --> 09:43.080
This involves me, too.

BIRDS FLUTTER CLOSE BY

10:11.160 --> 10:13.398

10:13.400 --> 10:15.680
Come on, show yourself,
you little cochon!

10:16.920 --> 10:18.838
I think that was a squirrel.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.358
And in any case,
you stand a better chance

10:21.360 --> 10:24.918
of reaching a peaceful resolution
if you just calm down.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.198
I'm not going to calm down while
some maniac's stalking my fiance.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.958
He's not a maniac.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.798
He's a man with a broken heart,

10:31.800 --> 10:34.040
and he deserves some understanding.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.198
Just wait till tomorrow.
That's all I'm asking.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.560
I'll drive you back after
the gig at the hotel.

her do that in here?

11:07.960 --> 11:09.158
Do what?

11:09.160 --> 11:11.800
- The voodoo?!
- It's fascinating.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.840
Their creator God is called Bondye.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.958
What Yveline's doing
is called "illuminasyon".

11:18.960 --> 11:21.198
The Immaculate Heart of Mary

11:21.200 --> 11:23.798
has a corresponding Lwa...

11:23.800 --> 11:27.600
Well, if you find it all so
fascinating, why don't you convert?

11:29.360 --> 11:32.518
If you don't mind, may I have
another slice of your sweet pie?

11:32.520 --> 11:36.040
- Yes, of course, dear.
That's what it's there for.
- Thank you.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.558
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.038
She has just offered my Bakewell
tart to a voodoo spirit!

11:51.040 --> 11:52.920
SHE SIGHS

11:57.400 --> 12:01.118
Lwa Erzulie Balianne helps people
forget their past loves.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.320
I'm going to ask her to watch over
Emmanuel.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.760
Heal his pain.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.280
It's the only way
he will have peace.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.900
The only way we will be free of him.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.998
"Je vous salue, Marie,

SHE GASPS

13:00.280 --> 13:01.678
Glass is all on the inside.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.718
Looks like someone broke the window,
reached in, unlocked the door,

13:04.720 --> 13:07.318
and dumped the chicken.
- Well done, Sherlock(!)

13:07.320 --> 13:09.918
Why don't you get out there
and start looking for this nutcase

13:09.920 --> 13:12.438
instead of standing around
stating the bleeding obvious?

13:12.440 --> 13:14.478
Sir, until I ask you a question,

13:14.480 --> 13:17.598
I must kindly ask you to shut your
mouth! Thank you very much.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.358
- Anyone see anything?
- No.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.918
I saw someone.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.038
Running away, through the window.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.438
Description?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.078
It was too dark.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.800
That's not very helpful, is it(?)

13:29.880 --> 13:32.438
And this bloke, he's a... a what?

13:32.440 --> 13:33.918
A houngan.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.360
A voodoo priest.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.158
I knew I shouldn't have
stayed in bed this morning!

13:39.160 --> 13:42.200
So, this is... some sort of...

13:43.440 --> 13:45.918
..voodoo sacrifice?
- No.

13:45.920 --> 13:49.320
Animal sacrifices
only take place during ceremonies.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.880
This... was a warning.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.960
SERGEANT SIGHS

14:06.880 --> 14:08.880
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

14:11.400 --> 14:12.640
Sir! Sir...

14:13.760 --> 14:15.638
Be careful, sir.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.238
Careful?

14:17.240 --> 14:19.318
The way he was looking at me.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.880
I think he was doing
something... voodoo.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.920
"Something voodoo"?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
Your sergeant scares easily.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.920
You'll be glad to hear I don't.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.280
- Where were you last night,
around 1:20am?
- Asleep in my tent.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.078
Farmer adjacent to the field
you're staying

14:49.080 --> 14:53.400
reported one of his chickens stolen
last night.
- That's unfortunate.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.278
Isn't it?

14:56.280 --> 14:58.478
Where'd you get your car?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.760
I paid for it
when I arrived in London.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.838
Didn't know voodoo priests
could afford cars.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.238
We are all ignorant of
some things, Inspector.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.678
You got proof?

15:10.680 --> 15:11.958
Of your ignorance?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.440
Of the car.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.120
You know what's strange?

15:17.680 --> 15:19.918
I've owned the car for only
two days now,

15:19.920 --> 15:24.960
and yet, you are the third officer
to ask to prove ownership.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.280
I wonder why that is.

if you want.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.038
I ask you questions, you tell me
lies. We go round in circles.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.518
But I can't be bothered
with all that,

15:45.520 --> 15:47.518
so I'll tell you what's
going to happen.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.078
You're going to get into your car,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.238
and you're going to drive out
of Kembleford,

15:52.240 --> 15:53.560
and never come back.

- Is that right?
- He's a voodoo priest.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.118
You don't know what he's capable of.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.478
Of course,
cos you're the voodoo expert(!)

19:22.560 --> 19:24.398
Froze his legs and arms,

19:24.400 --> 19:27.518

Sergeant, here's a tip.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.238
Make a note.

19:31.240 --> 19:35.038
When asking questions,
try to make them sensible!

19:35.040 --> 19:36.680
Father, where are you going?

19:38.240 --> 19:40.200
To research your theory.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.798

20:11.120 --> 20:12.638
I'm quite handy at that.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.560
Perhaps we're kindred spirits.

You were right.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.040
I am heartbroken.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.120
I'm sorry you're so unhappy.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.758
The last two months, all I could
think of was getting her back.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.678
Every waking moment.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.958
By killing Joseph?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.638
HE SCOFFS

20:37.640 --> 20:40.118
My plan was not to kill him.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.638
Then what?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.000
Enslave him.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.760
"Enslave him"?

20:48.480 --> 20:49.920
I followed them from London...

20:51.160 --> 20:53.600
...waiting for an opportunity
to give him this.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.278
In large doses, it kills.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.640
In small doses,
it can make a man appear dead.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.438
But there is a spot.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.358
A sweet spot.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.278
Not too much. Not too little.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.520
But just right.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.080
The man is neither dead nor alive.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.958
He can't speak.
He has no feeling.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.078
He walks without thought.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.440
Good for nothing more
than ploughing the fields.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.398
And presumably,
he can't love, either.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.520
Exactly.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.078
How can a man love

21:29.080 --> 21:30.518
without a soul?

21:30.520 --> 21:32.438
Zombification.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.078
Your word,

21:34.080 --> 21:35.320
not ours.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.600
What happened at the hotel?

21:41.520 --> 21:43.640
When I saw her on stage...

21:46.720 --> 21:48.000
She looked so...

21:50.120 --> 21:51.240
...free.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.960
I couldn't go through with it.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.240
No need to worry.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.878
- Are you all right, Father?
- Absolutely.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.638
- How did you...?
- Oh, Mr Mugridge gave me a lift.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.240
Yes, thank you...

22:17.680 --> 22:19.238
Good old Mr Mugridge.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.078
- In all likelihood,
she will call the police.
- What for?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.960
I haven't done anything.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.198
You don't know about Joseph, do you?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.480
He's dead.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.438
What?

22:33.440 --> 22:34.920
Possibly poisoned.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.200
- It wasn't me.
- Then you should tell
that to the police.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.040
You think they'll believe me?

22:44.320 --> 22:47.560
Father, I'm not going to hang
for something I didn't do.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.400

this will just make things worse.

HE GROANS

24:11.720 --> 24:14.038
I didn't do it.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.718
That'll be for the court
to decide...

24:16.720 --> 24:19.280
HE WHIMPERS

24:33.200 --> 24:35.358
'He died at the scene.'

24:35.360 --> 24:36.800
Oh, my God!

24:38.400 --> 24:39.838
This was in his pocket.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.278
We haven't tested it yet, but
we suspect it's some kind of poison.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.958
Must've paralysed him.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.838
So, my theory was right.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.238
One thing we can't understand
is how he gave it to him.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.158
There were no puncture marks
on Mr Sinclair's body.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.678
That's assuming that it
took effect immediately.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.518
If it was slow-acting,
he could've ingested it before...

24:58.520 --> 25:01.038
I don't need your help, Padre,
thank you.

25:01.040 --> 25:04.398
Anyone see him eat or drink
anything at the hotel?

25:04.400 --> 25:06.638
We were on stage as soon
as we got there.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.040
Weren't even offered a biscuit!

25:09.760 --> 25:13.840
Which means he probably ingested
the poison while he was on stage.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.198
The break-in!

25:36.200 --> 25:37.958
That's what he came here to do!

25:37.960 --> 25:40.038
Dead chicken was just a diversion.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.880
This is what he was really up to.
We'll need to take this.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.320
Well, that's a relief
that's all over.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.080
TEARFULLY: Excuse me...

25:56.000 --> 25:58.760
Inspector, I spoke to Emmanuel.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.158
He told me he didn't do it.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.358
Told me the same thing. Funny -
killers often say things like that.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.158
I believe he was telling the truth.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.878
He loved Yveline.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.558
Yes. Enough to kill her boyfriend.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.160
- Enough to let her go.
- You're a soft touch, Padre.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.238
At least consider the possibility!

26:16.240 --> 26:19.600
This case is closed!
Stick your oar out.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.720
You all right?

26:42.080 --> 26:43.760
I'm sorry about your father.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.400
Don't worry about me.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.280
You are so sweet.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.120
SHE GASPS Tommy... No.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.120
What are you doing?

27:14.160 --> 27:17.478
If you're still looking for clues...

27:17.480 --> 27:20.680
That means you think the voodoo
priest was innocent?

27:21.840 --> 27:24.160
- His name was Emmanuel.
- Oh...

27:25.280 --> 27:30.118
If he broke in last night,
then why did he pick the lock today?

27:30.120 --> 27:31.880
Why not come in the same way?

27:35.280 --> 27:37.678
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.278
- Didn't see what exactly?
- None of us did.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.398
We were too preoccupied
with the notion

27:42.400 --> 27:44.040
that Emmanuel was the intruder.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.038
Father!

DOG BARKS OUTSIDE

27:49.800 --> 27:50.838
Oh!

27:50.840 --> 27:52.678
Mind you don't cut yourself.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.400
Unless the intruder
had extendable arms...

27:57.040 --> 27:59.920
...he didn't unlock
the door from the outside.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.040
Must've unlocked it from the inside.

28:10.720 --> 28:14.638
Are you telling me that one of the
people living in your house

28:14.640 --> 28:16.638
is a homicidal poisoner?

28:16.640 --> 28:18.238
It would appear so.

28:18.240 --> 28:21.198
I warned you! Didn't I warn you?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.238
Strangers!

28:23.240 --> 28:26.718
- I take it you won't be asking them
to stay another night.
- HE SIGHS

28:26.720 --> 28:29.638
But their car won't be fixed
until tomorrow.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.478
And I stand a better chance of
working out who did it

28:32.480 --> 28:34.758
if I keep them close.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.560
And a better chance of getting
yourself killed!

28:40.080 --> 28:42.998
- I'll be...
- I'm staying tonight.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.318
- That won't...
- I'm staying tonight.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.158
And where will you sleep?

28:47.160 --> 28:49.878
The question isn't where will
I sleep.

28:49.880 --> 28:52.120
The question is
where will you sleep.

Did you hear that?!

29:08.320 --> 29:09.600
HE SNORTS

29:10.560 --> 29:13.040
It's a good thing one of us
was awake.

29:16.960 --> 29:20.760
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.518
Quite all right.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.680
Herbal tea.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.880
Good for insomnia.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.480
So, you and the old lady?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.478
Most certainly not!

29:34.480 --> 29:36.080
And who are you calling "old"?

29:37.600 --> 29:40.038
Mrs McCarthy,
why don't you wait in the bedroom?

29:40.040 --> 29:42.398
I'm not leaving you alone with that.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.598
I'll be all right.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.678
Um...

29:44.680 --> 29:46.000
Please.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.278
You said you saw someone running
away the night of the break-in?

30:03.280 --> 30:06.118
- That's right.
- Thing is, I have evidence

30:06.120 --> 30:08.398
that the break-in was staged.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.598
- You accusing me of
being a liar, Father?
- Distorting the truth.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.718
- You think I'm a murderer, too?
- I don't know.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.360
I'm not.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.560
Then why lie
about seeing an intruder?

30:22.160 --> 30:23.558
HE SIGHS

30:23.560 --> 30:25.760
Because you're protecting
whoever did it.

30:29.040 --> 30:33.280
- You saw the killer put the poison
on the saxophone, didn't you?
- No.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.680
But you saw something.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.478
I saw them running back into the
lounge after breaking the window.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.318
I didn't know what was going on.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.038
If I'd known they'd put poison
on the saxophone,

30:45.040 --> 30:46.800
I would have said something.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.558
- Who was it?
- What have you to gain?

30:51.560 --> 30:53.118
A man is dead.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.198
Two men!

30:54.200 --> 30:56.678
And now, you want to send someone
else to the executioner?

30:56.680 --> 31:00.118
- Whoever did this could
easily do it again.
- I doubt it.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.598
- Why?
- Because...

31:01.600 --> 31:03.120
it was personal.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.080
Let it lie, Father.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.800
Looking for me?

31:27.600 --> 31:29.278
I just wanted to say...

31:29.280 --> 31:30.320
Ow!

31:31.240 --> 31:32.440
That's sharp!

31:36.400 --> 31:39.040
Um, how sorry I am
about your father.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.240
Thank you, Father.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.400
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.758
Not while there's
a poisoner in the house.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.078
And look how much
you've drunk already.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.800
- But I made it myself!
- I don't care.

32:16.480 --> 32:20.078
And I hope you rinsed
your toothbrush before you used it.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.200
We can't afford to take any chances.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.278
Where are you going now?

32:33.280 --> 32:35.840
We have a gig coming up in Soho.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.320
So, the band's staying together?

32:40.640 --> 32:42.800
- We're not sure yet.
- What do you mean?

32:44.360 --> 32:46.518
- You're not leaving.
- I don't know.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.118
What you going to do instead?
Clean toilets?

32:49.120 --> 32:51.080
That's all you'll get
in this country.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.158
Morning all, good news!
Car's ready, wahey!

32:55.160 --> 32:56.678
Bad news is, you have to pick it up.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.640
I'll drive you down
whenever you're ready.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.640
- Thank you so much, Father.
- You've been a godsend.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.518
Tommy, before you go,

33:06.520 --> 33:08.118
can I have a word...

33:08.120 --> 33:09.800
in the garden?

33:11.160 --> 33:12.320
Of course.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.720
You wanted to say something, Father?

33:25.400 --> 33:26.718
I'm so sorry.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.320
For what?

33:29.440 --> 33:32.598
For the way your father treated you.
He was a bully.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.040
All your life, I imagine.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.878
It's his voice in your head

33:36.880 --> 33:40.318
when you don't feel you're good
enough. Not worthy.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.398
So, you brought me out here to what?
Psychoanalyse me?

33:43.400 --> 33:45.758
And then, there's Yveline.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.240
You're in love with her.

33:48.320 --> 33:52.398
It must've hurt you deeply when your
father announced their engagement.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.318
You think I killed him.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.558
Well we both saw
the shard of glass on your arm.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.358
That could've come from anywhere.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.760
It came from when you used your
elbow to break the kitchen window.

34:02.760 --> 34:06.278
You took the poison
from Emmanuel's tent, didn't you?

34:06.280 --> 34:07.800
When we went looking for him.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.440
'Afterwards, you stole
the chicken, killed it...'

34:25.800 --> 34:27.598
And then, when everyone was asleep,

34:27.600 --> 34:30.120
you put poison on
your father's saxophone...

34:36.400 --> 34:38.118
'..then staged the break-in, '

34:38.120 --> 34:42.797
left the dead chicken to make it
look as if it was Emmanuel.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.560
It wasn't even a plan
when I took the phial.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.440
But I knew what it was.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.160
And I knew I wanted to be free.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.440
I knew she wanted to be free, too.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.520
She never loved him.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.320
He would've made just as lousy
a husband as he did a father.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.598
And for that, he deserved to die?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.798
You just said what
a terrible father he was.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.598
That doesn't mean
I condone what you did,

35:28.600 --> 35:30.878
or that you shouldn't seek
forgiveness.

35:30.880 --> 35:35.158
The first step to that is telling
the police the truth.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.598
I'm not going to do that.

35:36.600 --> 35:39.118
And you're not going
to tell on me either.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.520
You won't be able to.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.760
Not after the poison I gave you.

- It wasn't in the tea.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.398
It was on your toothbrush.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.000
Mrs McCarthy was right.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.678
Never expected
those to be my last words.

Father! Father?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.560
Father... Father...?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.360
He's dead.

36:49.080 --> 36:50.478
No!

36:50.480 --> 36:51.958
- Father!
- No!

36:51.960 --> 36:53.318
It can't be!

36:53.320 --> 36:54.440
Father!

37:01.720 --> 37:03.438
No-one leaves.

37:03.440 --> 37:06.398
- I want a postmortem straightaway.
- Yes, sir.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.440
Toxicology report. Everything.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.640
I'm so sorry.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.080
There's something
I need to show you!

37:27.040 --> 37:30.238
- Well, I'll be...!
- He told you, didn't he?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.678
He told you
Emmanuel wasn't the killer.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.720
But would you listen?! No!

37:35.720 --> 37:37.158
And now he's dead.

37:37.160 --> 37:40.358
And it's your fault.
It's YOUR fault.

37:40.360 --> 37:43.235
- Now, look, I know you're upset...
- She's not wrong, though, is she?

37:44.320 --> 37:47.918
- You are nothing but a Keystone Cop.
- Now, look here!

37:47.920 --> 37:50.518
A useless, incompetent, lazy...

37:50.520 --> 37:53.278
- You watch it.
- Why? What are you
going to do? You going to arrest me?

37:53.280 --> 37:55.118
Sidney, stop it. This isn't helping.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.238
THEY SIGH

37:57.240 --> 37:58.718
His blood is on your hands.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.680
His blood is on the hands
of whoever killed him.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.518
And I promise you all,
I'm going to find out who that was.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.880
And make sure they hang.

38:11.840 --> 38:17.840
You're all suspects in the murders
of Joseph Sinclair and Father Brown.

38:18.960 --> 38:22.118
My sergeant's going to search you
and your belongings,

38:22.120 --> 38:24.158
and whichever one of you did it,

38:24.160 --> 38:27.758
I'm personally going
to see that you hang.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.398
- How could you? How could you?
A priest!
- What's this?

38:31.400 --> 38:34.438
- Tommy?
- I don't know what he's
talking about.
- I saw him that night!

38:34.440 --> 38:36.518
- He staged the break-in.
- I love you!

- Tommy Sinclair,

38:47.080 --> 38:49.638
I'm arresting you for the murders of
Joseph...

38:49.640 --> 38:51.598
- Wait! He's not dead.
- Who?
- Father Brown.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.198
I just gave him enough to knock
him out for a few hours

38:54.200 --> 38:56.478
while I could get away.
It wasn't enough to kill him.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.038
Well, you did kill him, didn't you?

38:58.040 --> 39:00.598
You don't understand.
It only slows his heart.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.480
It doesn't stop it. He's not dead.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.400

It would've been frightfully

Not to mention half my handyman
work comes from you, Father,

40:49.200 --> 40:50.798
so where would that have left me?

40:50.800 --> 40:53.678
Well, it's nice to know
I would've been missed!

40:53.680 --> 40:55.238
Look who found on the way here.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.040

41:27.040 --> 41:28.480
I'm happy.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.480
I'll get a knife to cut this.

41:36.840 --> 41:40.518
- I think we all know what
to do with that.
- It was a gift.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.840
No more voodoo for you.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.078
Padre!

41:45.080 --> 41:47.200
These are for you...

41:48.520 --> 41:50.958
From the staff, like.
Not just from me.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.838
But, you know... from me, too.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.438

not feeling guilty, are we?

41:55.440 --> 41:57.038

do wrong -

42:04.120 --> 42:06.280
and I'm not saying
I did anything wrong...

42:07.480 --> 42:10.680
...in the end,
I did save your bacon.

42:11.840 --> 42:15.038

enjoying tea with the padre

42:15.040 --> 42:18.438
if it weren't for me. So, you know,

42:18.440 --> 42:21.238
