Melinda: previously
on "ghost whisperer"....

00:02.315 --> 00:04.216
Zoe: that book is
the key to everything.

00:04.283 --> 00:05.684
The book is always changing.
new things are written,
old things are erased.

00:05.752 --> 00:07.386
You know,
carl said that aiden

00:07.453 --> 00:08.854
Would have powers
that i don't.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.489
What if that means
seeing things things
that i can't,

00:10.556 --> 00:11.723
Things that are real?

00:11.791 --> 00:13.125
Tell them why
your friends shine.

00:13.192 --> 00:14.826
Because
they don't have faces.

00:14.894 --> 00:16.628
They're made of light.

00:16.696 --> 00:17.963
But they're scared.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.564
What are
they scared of, buddy?

00:19.632 --> 00:21.533
The shadows.

00:21.601 --> 00:23.068
What kind of shadows
are those?

00:23.136 --> 00:25.570
The ones they make
from the parts that
get left behind.

00:25.638 --> 00:26.738
Parts of what?

00:26.806 --> 00:29.274
People. broken people.

[thunder]

00:33.379 --> 00:35.313
[indistinct chatter]

00:35.381 --> 00:37.416
Be sure to let them
cool a little.

00:37.483 --> 00:38.750
I will.

00:38.818 --> 00:41.086
And save your tin foil
for the shinies.

00:41.154 --> 00:43.255
You, too, aunt delia.

00:43.322 --> 00:45.023
Ok, honey, i will.

00:45.091 --> 00:46.825
The shinies?

00:46.893 --> 00:48.693
Kind of sounds like
a new family in town.

00:48.761 --> 00:50.529
Melinda:
pretty weird, huh?

00:50.596 --> 00:52.931
Be grateful.
ned's imaginary friend
was named bob,

00:52.999 --> 00:54.866
And all bob ever did
was watch tv

00:54.934 --> 00:57.169
And agree with everything
ned had to say.

00:57.236 --> 01:00.405
I know, but he talks to
these shiny people like
they're real, you know?

01:00.473 --> 01:02.274
And i can't
see them or hear them.

01:02.341 --> 01:06.144
And then they put these
scary ideas in his head,
like the shadows.

01:06.212 --> 01:07.679
Which she can't see, either.

01:07.747 --> 01:09.481
Not the ones
that move, anyway.

01:09.549 --> 01:11.983
Shadows that move?
apparently.

01:12.051 --> 01:14.119
I mean, could
a 5-year-old
even make that up?

01:14.187 --> 01:16.354
One that lives
with ghosts, sure.

01:17.523 --> 01:19.057
What?

01:19.125 --> 01:22.294
He's supposed to have
abilities that i don't,

01:22.361 --> 01:25.730
But what if talking
to these shiny people
is one of them?

01:25.798 --> 01:27.632
You know, i mean,
what if aiden's
imaginary friends

01:27.700 --> 01:29.100
Aren't imaginary?

01:29.168 --> 01:31.770
I don't know.
what that be so bad?

01:31.838 --> 01:32.938
They told aiden
this morning

01:33.005 --> 01:34.206
That something bad
was going to happen.

01:34.273 --> 01:36.408
Something
really bad,
really soon.

01:36.476 --> 01:37.476
Oh.

01:39.846 --> 01:42.113
[sirens in distance]

01:42.181 --> 01:44.883
Man: ok, be still.

01:44.951 --> 01:46.251
Girl: where
are my parents?

01:46.319 --> 01:49.020
I want my mom
to come with me.

01:49.088 --> 01:52.290
All right, ruby g.,
don't even tell me
you're nervous.

01:52.358 --> 01:54.392
Hello, you guys
are about to cut me open
and rip out my gallbladder.

01:54.460 --> 01:55.894
And i can't miss
the playoffs.

01:55.962 --> 01:57.329
Time out.

01:57.396 --> 01:59.231
Nobody's going to be
ripping anything
out of anywhere.

01:59.298 --> 02:01.600
And secondly,
you're not going
to miss the playoffs.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.034
Because we never
let anybody miss
the playoffs,

02:03.102 --> 02:04.569
Do we?
hey, um,

02:04.637 --> 02:06.338
Maybe we could
postpone the surgery?

02:06.405 --> 02:08.907
Ruby, how many matches
have you missed because
of your stomach aches?

02:08.975 --> 02:11.042
Too many.
all right.

02:11.110 --> 02:13.078
So this surgery
is going to make
that problem disappear.

02:13.145 --> 02:15.080
Uh, if i can ever
find a vein.

02:15.147 --> 02:16.948
We should try
the other arm,
huh? all right.

02:18.584 --> 02:20.051
Yeah. don't worry
about it.

02:20.119 --> 02:21.920
Everything's going
to be all right.

02:21.988 --> 02:24.723
Thanks. just relax, ruby,
it's going to be ok.

02:24.790 --> 02:25.857
I'm scared.

02:25.925 --> 02:27.092
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

02:27.159 --> 02:29.694
Except this is going to be
a little pinch.
ow.

02:29.762 --> 02:31.463
The surgery will take
about an hour.

02:31.531 --> 02:32.764
And you're gonna be out,
and be able to go home

02:32.832 --> 02:34.299
And sleep
in your own bed.

02:34.367 --> 02:36.268
Yeah, but i'm gonna
have a big honkin'
scar on my stomach.

02:36.335 --> 02:37.669
No. the surgery's
laparoscopic.

02:37.737 --> 02:39.638
There will be four
tiny little marks.

02:39.705 --> 02:41.506
All right?
now, dr. prakash

02:41.574 --> 02:44.109
Is going to give you
something that's going
to help you relax.

02:44.176 --> 02:46.945
Hey, um, you're not
going to let

02:47.013 --> 02:49.381
Anything happen to me?
promise?

02:49.448 --> 02:50.949
Promise.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.188
What are you doing?

02:57.256 --> 02:58.757
Uh, nothing,
dr. morgan.

02:58.824 --> 03:00.325
I was just helping--

03:00.393 --> 03:02.994
Dr. prakash
is perfectly capable
of doing his job.

03:03.062 --> 03:04.129

Dr. lucas is going
to close.
i'm honored.

03:23.983 --> 03:26.785
Well, you're the one
who promised her there
wouldn't be any scars.

03:26.852 --> 03:29.054
Well, i didn't so much
as promise her that.

we could do.

04:17.036 --> 04:20.238
She was a healthy

Not healthy enough,
apparently.

04:25.878 --> 04:28.580
Is that how you feel?

04:28.648 --> 04:30.315
I mean, really?

04:30.383 --> 04:32.183
It's the truth.

04:32.251 --> 04:34.219
That's how we cope
with things, huh?

04:34.286 --> 04:35.987
By not caring.

04:36.055 --> 04:39.691
No, by not getting
invested in the first place.

04:39.759 --> 04:43.228
You set yourself up,
not to mention the patient.

04:43.295 --> 04:44.429
She was scared. i--

04:44.497 --> 04:46.531
I just wanted
to reassure her.

04:46.599 --> 04:49.367
You made an invasive procedure
sound like a haircut.

04:49.435 --> 04:52.337
The only thing
you ever say
to a patient ever

04:52.405 --> 04:53.805
Is that surgery
carries risks.

04:53.873 --> 04:55.540
Period.

Why is that, pal?

No. i just don't
like to imagine them.

any bad stuff would
happen to me.

07:03.475 --> 07:05.276
I haven't seen her
hanging around.

07:05.344 --> 07:07.778
It started happening
right after we lost her.

07:07.846 --> 07:09.347
That doesn't mean
she's haunting you.

07:09.414 --> 07:11.115
I mean,
you said it yourself

07:11.183 --> 07:12.883
That her death
was no one's fault.

07:12.951 --> 07:15.920
Yeah, but morgan got on me
for reassuring her, right?

07:15.988 --> 07:17.655
So maybe she heard that.
and then she thought that...

07:17.723 --> 07:20.658
Jim, you didn't do
anything wrong.

07:20.726 --> 07:22.126
Has anything else
happened?

07:22.194 --> 07:23.995
No.

07:24.062 --> 07:25.930
But i'm telling you,
i feel like...

07:25.998 --> 07:28.699
I could feel that she was
angry at me, you know?

07:28.767 --> 07:30.201
I don't blame her.

07:30.268 --> 07:33.371
Probably 'cause
you're angry
at yourself.

07:33.438 --> 07:35.339
'cause you care.

07:35.407 --> 07:37.408
Too much,
according to morgan.

07:37.476 --> 07:38.909
One of the many
reasons

07:38.977 --> 07:40.478
I'm in love
with you.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.480
You were kind to her.

07:42.547 --> 07:45.916
There's nothing
wrong with that.

07:45.984 --> 07:48.853
You know, maybe...

07:48.920 --> 07:50.755
You're being haunted
by your own doubts

07:50.822 --> 07:52.123
More than
anything else.

07:53.191 --> 07:55.459
Maybe.

07:57.429 --> 08:00.631
Look, what did aiden mean
when he said that his friends

08:00.699 --> 08:02.733
Said no bad stuff
would happen to him?

08:02.801 --> 08:05.569
Nothing.

08:05.637 --> 08:08.539
Tell you what,
why don't you send
her picture to my cell

08:08.607 --> 08:10.541
And i'll take
a look at it? ok?

08:10.609 --> 08:11.842
If it'll make you
feel better.

08:11.910 --> 08:13.978
Yeah, yeah, it might.

08:17.582 --> 08:18.983
Carl?

08:19.051 --> 08:21.685
If you're around,
i really need
to talk to you.

08:21.753 --> 08:23.054
Carl? [gasps] oh.

08:23.121 --> 08:24.722
Do you always
have to do that?

08:24.790 --> 08:27.024
Do you always
have to keep calling?

08:27.092 --> 08:28.659
Is it a problem?

08:28.727 --> 08:30.861
They don't like me
to talk to you too often.

08:30.929 --> 08:33.530
We're watchers, you know.
we're not meddlers.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.366
I'm sorry.
i know. it's just...

08:35.433 --> 08:38.436
Your son.
you're worried
about your son.

08:38.503 --> 08:40.004
His new friends.

08:40.038 --> 08:41.672
It all felt harmless
until they told him

08:41.740 --> 08:44.542
That something bad
was going to happen.

08:44.609 --> 08:46.243
Jim lost a patient
yesterday during surgery,

08:46.311 --> 08:48.512
And he thinks
that she might be
haunting him.

08:48.580 --> 08:50.681
But you're not so sure.

08:50.749 --> 08:51.916
Ok.

08:51.983 --> 08:53.851
Let me see the picture
on your cell phone.

08:53.919 --> 08:55.119
How did you know that?!

08:55.187 --> 08:58.989
Oh, right.
the watching.

09:00.525 --> 09:02.893
Hmm. haven't seen her.

09:02.961 --> 09:05.229
Doesn't prove anything.

09:05.297 --> 09:08.032
Why don't you ask me
what you really
want to know?

09:08.100 --> 09:09.533
Is it true?

09:09.601 --> 09:11.335
The shinies and the shadows?

09:11.403 --> 09:13.370
It just all feels
so fanciful.

09:13.438 --> 09:15.172
Because you've never
seen them.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.308
Hmm?

09:17.375 --> 09:20.377
So the person
who asks people

09:20.445 --> 09:24.048
To believe what
they can't see

09:24.116 --> 09:27.852
Is refusing
to believe what
she can't see.

09:27.919 --> 09:31.155
It's completely normal
for children to have
imaginary friends.

09:31.223 --> 09:33.224
But you don't really
believe that.

09:33.291 --> 09:36.227
Carl, please.
just once, give me
a straight answer.

09:36.294 --> 09:39.029
I couldn't,
even if i wanted to.

09:39.097 --> 09:41.866
It's too dangerous.

09:41.933 --> 09:43.067
For you?

09:43.135 --> 09:45.035
Are the shadows
that powerful?

09:45.103 --> 09:47.037
All i can
tell you is this--

09:47.105 --> 09:49.807
The answers are there.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.376
But you have to know
when to look.

09:52.444 --> 09:53.410
Don't you mean "where"?

09:53.478 --> 09:55.379
That you already know.

09:55.447 --> 09:57.481
If you're talking
about the book,

09:57.549 --> 09:58.782
Ned's already looked.

09:58.850 --> 10:01.418
Ok, there's no shinies
or shadows in there.

10:01.486 --> 10:02.686
Maybe not now.

10:02.754 --> 10:04.421
What does that mean?

10:04.489 --> 10:07.057
What use would
the book be

10:07.125 --> 10:11.428
If it got itself
destroyed?

10:11.496 --> 10:16.066
Are you saying that
the book hides things
to protect itself?

10:17.836 --> 10:19.537
Someday...

10:19.604 --> 10:21.572
Someday soon,

10:21.640 --> 10:25.576
You may want to think
about doing the same.

10:38.123 --> 10:40.457
Please don't touch that.

10:40.525 --> 10:42.993
President bedford.
i wasn't sure how long
i'd be waiting.

10:43.061 --> 10:45.262
Your assistant didn't
know where you were.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.631
Well, i was detained.
my apologies.

10:47.699 --> 10:50.768
You wanted to see me
about something?

10:50.835 --> 10:52.303
You honestly
don't know?

10:52.370 --> 10:53.737
Professor sanders?

10:53.805 --> 10:56.106
Tenure? job for life?

10:56.174 --> 10:57.575
Well, if you want
to congratulate him,

10:57.642 --> 11:00.811
I suggest
a nice bordeaux.

11:00.879 --> 11:02.613
This is twice
you've passed me over.

11:02.681 --> 11:05.349
I get published more
and invited to more conferences

11:05.417 --> 11:07.685
Than any professor
in the entire
psych department.

11:07.752 --> 11:08.852
Do you?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.187
I've also been voted
best professor

11:10.255 --> 11:11.422
By my students
three years running.

11:11.489 --> 11:12.690
Really?

11:12.757 --> 11:13.791
I even worked
on my appearance

11:13.858 --> 11:15.492
And my hair since
your last evaluation.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.095
Well, i find that
hard to believe.

11:20.732 --> 11:22.433
It's a job offer,

11:22.500 --> 11:24.768
From collier university.
it's not the first.

11:24.836 --> 11:26.670
It's a good school.
you should take it.

11:26.738 --> 11:28.205
I don't want to leave here.

11:28.273 --> 11:31.041
I can't.
why not?

11:32.844 --> 11:34.812
Let's just cut
to the chase.

11:34.879 --> 11:36.880
What do you have
against me?

11:38.016 --> 11:39.483
[scoffs]

11:39.551 --> 11:41.485
Well, it's not so much

11:41.553 --> 11:42.853
That i don't respect you

11:42.921 --> 11:45.256
Or that i disapprove
of your cowboy methods

11:45.323 --> 11:48.025
Or that i cringe
every time

11:48.093 --> 11:51.161
You open your mouth
representing this
university in public.

11:51.229 --> 11:53.097
Although all those
things are true,

11:53.164 --> 11:55.866
It's just,
the simple fact is,

11:55.934 --> 11:59.803
I just don't like you.

11:59.871 --> 12:03.040
Well, for a minute there,
i thought it was personal.

12:04.609 --> 12:06.610
What's not to like?
i'm likeable, right?

12:06.678 --> 12:07.745
People like me.

12:07.812 --> 12:08.979
Yeah, we like you.

12:09.047 --> 12:10.714
[sighs] well,
that's a start.

12:10.782 --> 12:11.849
Jim, could you
step it up, there?

12:11.916 --> 12:12.850
I got a date
at the wine bar
at lento's.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.918
Hey, count me in there.

12:14.986 --> 12:16.487
Did you i.d. your ghost?
not yet.

12:16.554 --> 12:19.189
And there haven't been
any other hauntings, so...

12:19.257 --> 12:20.724
Well, maybe it's just
some random hospital ghost

12:20.792 --> 12:22.259
Who was messing
with the lockers
and the sound system.

12:22.327 --> 12:23.527
Yeah, that's possible.

12:23.595 --> 12:25.629
Or maybe the ghost
was just haunting
somebody else.

12:25.697 --> 12:28.532
What about dr. morgan?
was he surprised
by what happened?

12:28.600 --> 12:29.900
I wondered about that.

12:29.968 --> 12:31.068
He was surprised
at first,

12:31.136 --> 12:32.870
But then he just turned
and walked away.

12:32.937 --> 12:34.371
Hmm. maybe it's not
the first time.

12:34.439 --> 12:36.340
Maybe that's why
he's being such
a sourpuss.

12:36.408 --> 12:38.175
'cause he's got a ghost
keeping him up at night.

12:38.243 --> 12:40.177
Hey, doctor morgan's
a good man.

12:40.245 --> 12:43.147
He's just frustrated
he can't perform
surgery anymore.

12:43.214 --> 12:45.649
He's in the early stages
of parkinson's.

12:45.717 --> 12:46.917
You know,
he's hard on us

12:46.985 --> 12:49.086
Because he wants us
to be as good as he was.

12:49.154 --> 12:51.088
Eli: funny.

12:51.156 --> 12:54.258
The only thing
bedford wants from me
is to dry up and blow away.

13:06.538 --> 13:09.206
What are you--
are you crazy?

13:09.274 --> 13:10.474
Yeah. for you.

13:10.542 --> 13:11.775
Come on.

13:13.545 --> 13:16.113
I locked the door.

13:16.181 --> 13:17.681
Come on. i'll do
anything for you.

13:17.749 --> 13:19.850
Absolutely anything.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.121
He used me.

13:24.189 --> 13:26.890
And then he just
threw me away.

13:28.660 --> 13:30.094
What'd you see?

13:30.161 --> 13:32.730
Um, let me just
put it this way--

13:32.797 --> 13:34.631
You're not the one
who's being haunted.

13:43.079 --> 13:44.512
Wow, so the old man
did ok for himself.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.314
Was he by any chance
married at the time?

13:46.382 --> 13:48.650
No, he was divorced,
and i think for a long time.

13:48.718 --> 13:50.719
Any clues about
who she was?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.420
Hmm, she was wearing
yellow scrubs.

13:52.488 --> 13:54.756
Which means she was
a med student.

13:54.824 --> 13:55.824
Damn it.
yikes.

13:55.892 --> 13:58.493
The good doctor,
whether married or not,

13:58.561 --> 13:59.794
Wasn't being so good.

13:59.862 --> 14:01.329
You're not blogging this,
ok? don't blog this.

14:01.397 --> 14:02.530
I'm offended.

14:02.598 --> 14:03.932
I'm searching
for female med students

14:04.000 --> 14:06.334
At rockland who have
died in the past
five years.

14:06.402 --> 14:08.637
Here we go,
two of them,
both male.

14:08.704 --> 14:09.771
What do you got?

14:09.839 --> 14:12.374
Med school face page.
ooh, i found her.

14:12.441 --> 14:16.611
"tina clark, 22,
went missing this week."

14:16.679 --> 14:17.979
That was 6 months ago.

14:18.047 --> 14:20.448
Is there a body?
doesn't look like it.

14:20.516 --> 14:21.483
Wait. i know her.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.884
She and i took
morgan's class.

14:22.952 --> 14:26.621
She was really quiet.
i think she was his t.a.

14:26.689 --> 14:28.056
I think you mean
t and a.

14:28.124 --> 14:29.491
Look, whatever
their relationship,

14:29.558 --> 14:31.493
We have to figure out
what happened between them

14:31.560 --> 14:33.128
And why she's so angry
at morgan.

14:33.195 --> 14:35.096
You know, i'd really
like to give this guy

14:35.164 --> 14:37.432
A chance to explain himself.
he was a good teacher.

15:09.465 --> 15:12.000
[pills clattering]

15:18.374 --> 15:20.842
Dr. morgan?
oh, i'm sorry.

15:20.910 --> 15:21.977
Can i give you a hand?

15:22.044 --> 15:25.447
I dropped some pills.

15:26.549 --> 15:28.216
For my parkinson's,

15:28.284 --> 15:29.517
If that look on
your face means

15:29.585 --> 15:30.585
It's any
of your business.

15:30.653 --> 15:32.354
I'm sorry.

15:33.990 --> 15:35.423
I just came by
to ask your advice

15:35.491 --> 15:37.292
About that liver patient
who was admitted last night.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.360
Aaronson?
yeah.

15:38.427 --> 15:39.894
Leave the files.

15:39.962 --> 15:41.596
I'll review it
and i'll get it back to you.

15:41.664 --> 15:43.365
All right.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.068
Ah, doctor,

15:47.136 --> 15:48.703
Look, i've been meaning
to ask you about

15:48.771 --> 15:50.705
Tina clark.
do you remember her?

15:50.773 --> 15:51.840
Did you know her?

15:51.907 --> 15:53.008
I knew her.

15:53.075 --> 15:54.576
Someone i'm close to
was asking about her,

15:54.643 --> 15:57.879
And i remembered her
from your intro
to clinical medicine class.

15:57.947 --> 15:59.714
You know she went missing,
don't you?

15:59.782 --> 16:01.983
Well, i knew
that she quit
medical school.

16:02.051 --> 16:03.985
I heard she went to
new york after that.

16:04.053 --> 16:05.220
Was that the last thing
you heard about her?

16:05.287 --> 16:06.988
Well, i saw
her photo in the news,

16:07.056 --> 16:08.356
Just like everyone else.

16:08.424 --> 16:09.891
Right. i'm sorry.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.092
I know this must be hard
for you.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.527
I know she was
your teaching assistant.

16:12.595 --> 16:13.695
And it did seem like
the two of you were close, so--

16:13.763 --> 16:16.297
Did it, now?

16:16.365 --> 16:20.568
Yeah, look, i'm just
trying to help find her,
that's all.

16:20.636 --> 16:22.237
You should talk
to the police.

16:23.839 --> 16:26.641
Did they talk to you?

16:26.709 --> 16:27.809
No.

16:27.877 --> 16:29.310
Why?

16:29.378 --> 16:33.681
Do you think
you know something
about her, about me?

16:33.749 --> 16:35.517
Look, dr. morgan,

16:35.584 --> 16:37.519
The shortest answer
to that question is yes.

16:37.586 --> 16:40.321
Something that could get
you a good evaluation,

16:40.389 --> 16:41.823
Get you into cardiology?

16:41.891 --> 16:44.125
Let it go. there's
no mileage here.

16:44.193 --> 16:45.493
Doctor, i'm not trying
to blackmail you.

16:45.561 --> 16:46.895
I'm just asking you
to help find a young woman

16:46.962 --> 16:48.463
That i thought
you cared about.

16:48.531 --> 16:50.732
This is all sound
an awful lot like
blackmail to me.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.967
We're done here.

16:54.503 --> 16:57.005
All right.

16:59.842 --> 17:01.276
[door closes]

17:01.343 --> 17:02.477
Blackmail?
yep.

17:02.545 --> 17:04.779
I mean, you talked
about a missing girl

17:04.847 --> 17:06.114
And he went straight
to blackmail?

17:06.182 --> 17:07.348
And he said
there's no mileage here,

17:07.415 --> 17:09.017
Like he'd been cornered
on the topic before.

17:09.085 --> 17:10.652
Maybe someone else
knew about the affair.

17:10.719 --> 17:12.252
Well, people gossip.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.289
Yeah, so did you
talk to any of his
other students?

17:14.356 --> 17:15.656
Yeah, i did.

17:15.723 --> 17:17.058
And nobody wants to be
known as the person

17:17.126 --> 17:18.292
Who blackmailed
their professor.

17:18.359 --> 17:19.661
But a few of them knew tina.

17:19.728 --> 17:21.128
What did they say
about her?

17:21.196 --> 17:23.198
They said that
she was always tired,
like any medical student.

17:23.265 --> 17:25.200
But that she paid
her tuition in cash.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.135
In cash?

17:27.203 --> 17:28.502
Her full
tuition?

17:28.570 --> 17:31.072
Yeah. lots of small bills
in lots of installments.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.407
And they said
she was scraping by,

17:32.475 --> 17:34.476
You know, just borrowing
money for books and lab fees.

17:34.543 --> 17:36.478
But, you know,
there was something else.

17:36.545 --> 17:40.215
When i walked in on morgan,
he was taking pills.

17:40.282 --> 17:42.584
And he looked like
he'd been caught,
he was wired.

17:42.651 --> 17:44.719
Maybe he was just
taking something
for his parkinson's.

17:44.787 --> 17:48.022
Yeah, or maybe he and tina
had more in common
than just their affair.

17:48.090 --> 17:50.058
Wait a minute.
you think that

17:50.126 --> 17:51.326
She's paying all
of her bills in cash

17:51.393 --> 17:54.329
Because they were
dealing right out
of the hospital?

17:54.396 --> 17:56.764
He does have easy access
to drugs.

18:10.713 --> 18:13.414
I feel so lost.

18:13.482 --> 18:16.284
I can help you.

18:17.486 --> 18:19.721
Please.

18:19.788 --> 18:22.924
Please.

18:22.992 --> 18:25.960
Don't judge me.

18:26.028 --> 18:28.530
What do you mean?

18:36.272 --> 18:38.273
[indistinct chatter]

18:52.688 --> 18:54.689
[men cat-calling,
whistling]

19:02.631 --> 19:05.099
[men cheering]

19:05.167 --> 19:07.235
Oh, yeah!
all right!

19:29.725 --> 19:32.060
[door slams]

19:49.211 --> 19:51.045
Tina...tina?

19:57.286 --> 20:01.089
Go away, tina.
for good.

20:03.892 --> 20:05.526
Who did this?

20:05.594 --> 20:06.728
Who was threatening you?

20:06.795 --> 20:08.363
It wasn't a threat.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.331
Are you saying
that someone killed you?

20:10.399 --> 20:12.166
He wanted me gone.

20:12.234 --> 20:14.769
Who? was it morgan?

20:14.837 --> 20:17.105
Yes.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.173
[gasps]

20:23.946 --> 20:25.947
[sighs]

20:31.314 --> 20:32.381
Thank you.
so i tell you

20:32.449 --> 20:33.916
That a med student
is a stripper,

20:33.983 --> 20:35.417
And you're not
surprised either?

20:35.485 --> 20:37.953
Well, tina wouldn't be
the first grad student
to moonlight.

20:38.021 --> 20:38.987
That's what i said.

20:39.055 --> 20:40.823
Tuition's expensive,
time is money.

20:40.890 --> 20:42.391
It's maximum results
for minimum effort.

20:42.459 --> 20:43.992
Yeah, easy
for you to say.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.228
Well, what did
tina's other career

20:46.296 --> 20:47.763
Really have to do
with anything?

20:47.831 --> 20:49.465
Maybe that's why morgan
wanted to be so rid of her.

20:49.532 --> 20:51.767
It's bad enough
for your career
to date a student.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.236
Even worse
if she happens
to be a stripper.

20:54.304 --> 20:56.405
What? bad enough to want
to kill her, though?

20:56.473 --> 20:58.741
Tina said
that he wanted her gone,

20:58.808 --> 21:00.542
But she still hasn't
told me how she died.

21:00.610 --> 21:02.177
We gotta find that body.

21:02.245 --> 21:03.612
Have the police tell us
what the ghost won't.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.814
Morgan said
the last thing he heard

21:05.882 --> 21:07.116
Is that she was on
the way to new york.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.550
So if that wasn't
in the papers,

21:08.618 --> 21:09.885
It'll help narrow
down the search.

21:09.953 --> 21:11.820
Especially
if they're only
looking in the morgues.

21:11.888 --> 21:13.856
I'll call detective blair.

21:13.923 --> 21:16.158
She doesn't
ask questions anymore.

21:16.226 --> 21:17.693
She's glad for the help.

21:17.761 --> 21:19.261
Wait. where
are you going?

21:19.329 --> 21:20.863
Uh, tina's other life,

21:20.930 --> 21:22.564
The one she hid,
to find out what else

21:22.632 --> 21:24.433
She's been hiding.
wait a minute.

21:24.501 --> 21:25.701
You're going
to a strip club?

21:25.769 --> 21:27.336
Yes. ok?

21:27.403 --> 21:28.604
And i never thought
i would say this
to my husband,

21:28.671 --> 21:30.139
But you're coming
with me.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.307
Hallelujah.

21:33.510 --> 21:35.878
What about me?!

21:35.945 --> 21:37.546
Man: that's
all right, girl!

21:37.614 --> 21:40.382
[indistinct chatter]

21:40.450 --> 21:42.651
Um...
so the bouncer said

21:42.719 --> 21:44.586
You guys were friends
of tina's?

21:44.654 --> 21:46.555
Uh, yeah, we took
a class together once.

21:46.623 --> 21:48.657
Did you know that tina
was in medical school?

21:48.725 --> 21:49.992
Yeah.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.728
You know, i used to be
an executive assistant downtown.

21:52.796 --> 21:54.963
Thought i'd do this
a couple hours a week.

21:55.031 --> 21:57.065
One night turned into three,

21:57.133 --> 21:59.601
Three turned into five,

21:59.669 --> 22:01.770
And pretty soon,
i couldn't stay awake
at my day job.

22:01.838 --> 22:03.906
Now this is what i do.

22:03.973 --> 22:06.608
So is that what
happened with tina?

22:06.676 --> 22:08.644
Sure, she said this was
short-term for her,

22:08.711 --> 22:12.381
And i believed her
because one day i came in,
and she was just gone.

22:12.448 --> 22:13.882
Was that when
they reported
her missing?

22:13.950 --> 22:15.384
No. she went missing later.

22:15.451 --> 22:16.885
She left here for new york.

22:16.953 --> 22:19.054
Didn't say good-bye?

22:19.122 --> 22:23.358
Look, she got on
the wrong side of somebody,

22:23.426 --> 22:26.228
And she didn't say who.

22:26.296 --> 22:28.597
You know, we tried
to stay friends.

22:28.665 --> 22:30.432
I even went
to visit her once.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.434
She had a nice place.

22:32.502 --> 22:34.002
A really nice place.

22:34.070 --> 22:36.004
You seem surprised.

22:36.072 --> 22:38.774
[chuckles] we don't make
that kind of money here.

22:38.842 --> 22:41.176
I figured she landed
on her feet,

22:41.244 --> 22:44.379
Met somebody.
a rich somebody.

22:44.447 --> 22:47.382
Charee, do you mind
if we show you
some photographs?

22:47.450 --> 22:50.686
Ahem, right.
have you seen
this guy?

22:52.155 --> 22:53.922
No.

22:53.990 --> 22:56.758
Morgan had a beard
for a while, so it might--

22:56.826 --> 22:59.294
Wait, wait, go back.
that guy.

22:59.362 --> 23:01.530
I've seen him with tina.
wait a minute.

23:01.598 --> 23:03.599
Why didn't the cops
show me that guy?

23:03.666 --> 23:05.334
That's bedford.
are you sure?

23:05.401 --> 23:06.435
President bedford?
oh, yeah.

23:06.502 --> 23:08.470
They were arguing
about something.

23:08.538 --> 23:11.106
At the time,
i thought it was
because he was cheap

23:11.174 --> 23:12.608
And they were
coming to terms.

23:12.675 --> 23:14.276
To terms?

23:14.344 --> 23:15.878
Because they went into
the back room after.

23:15.945 --> 23:18.447
You know,
for a private.

23:18.514 --> 23:20.115
The next day,

23:20.183 --> 23:21.783
Tina was gone.

23:21.851 --> 23:23.919
[deep voice]
shh, come on,
don't do it.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.754
We told you.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.023
[high-pitched voice]
what? you never told me.

23:28.091 --> 23:30.325
[deep voice]
yes, we did.

23:30.393 --> 23:31.793
Don't talk to him.

23:31.861 --> 23:33.562
[high-pitched voice]
why not?

23:33.630 --> 23:35.864
[deep voice]
you know why not.

23:35.932 --> 23:37.499
Aiden,
what are you doing?

23:37.567 --> 23:39.902
Playing.

23:39.969 --> 23:42.571
Playing what?
teacher.

23:42.639 --> 23:44.740
Is that the teacher?

23:44.807 --> 23:47.175
Who's not supposed
to talk to him?

23:47.243 --> 23:50.045
You.

23:50.113 --> 23:53.248
Who doesn't want me
to talk to him?

23:53.316 --> 23:55.717
Well, my friends.

23:55.785 --> 23:59.621
They say the shadows
don't like it when you do.

24:01.190 --> 24:05.127
Whose teacher
have i been talking to?

24:05.194 --> 24:07.262
Yours?

24:07.330 --> 24:09.865
He teaches grown-ups.

24:09.933 --> 24:12.734
Is it your daddy's teacher?

24:12.802 --> 24:14.870
No.

24:14.938 --> 24:18.206
Uncle eli's.

24:20.610 --> 24:22.210
[cell phone rings]

24:22.278 --> 24:24.346
Hey, i was just
about to call you.

24:24.414 --> 24:25.948
They found tina's body.

24:26.015 --> 24:27.449
She was laying dead
in the street.

24:27.517 --> 24:31.053
She's been a jane doe
in some morgue in
downtown new york.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.688
Oded on
prescription meds.

24:32.755 --> 24:35.157
You know what,
i'm not surprised.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.792
I felt high
when i was dancing.

24:36.859 --> 24:39.161
She must have been
doing drugs just to
make it through the night.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.964
Cops were finally able
to search her apartment.

24:42.031 --> 24:44.199
They found a lot
of hidden cash.

24:44.267 --> 24:46.702
Her friend said
that she had money,
enough to od.

24:46.769 --> 24:50.105
But then why would
she be blaming
dr. morgan for her death?

24:50.173 --> 24:51.606
Maybe 'cause
he turned on her.

24:51.674 --> 24:53.642
Threatening her
to make her leave town.

24:53.710 --> 24:56.111
Except he's not the guy
they saw at the club.

24:56.179 --> 24:57.813
It was bedford,
your boss, your teacher.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.081
My teacher?

24:59.148 --> 25:00.882
Yeah, it was bedford.
look, i'll explain later.

25:00.950 --> 25:03.118
Now we just have
to figure out
how he's involved.

25:03.186 --> 25:04.786
Think he's sleeping
with her, too?

25:04.854 --> 25:06.154
No, it's gotta be
more than that

25:06.222 --> 25:07.589
For the shadows
to get involved.

25:07.657 --> 25:08.690
The shadows?

25:08.758 --> 25:10.158
Yeah, aiden said that

25:10.226 --> 25:11.860
I'm not supposed
to talk to bedford

25:11.928 --> 25:13.662
Because they don't like it
when i do.

25:13.730 --> 25:17.332
The shadows, the parts
that get left behind when
people go into the light,

25:17.400 --> 25:18.767
They actually
want something?

25:18.835 --> 25:20.435
Well, whatever it is,
they're scary enough

25:20.503 --> 25:22.104
That the book decided
to rewrite itself

25:22.171 --> 25:23.538
To erase
any mention of them.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.675
Ok, just pretend
for a moment that
any of this makes sense.

25:26.743 --> 25:29.811
The shadows are in bed
with the president?

25:29.879 --> 25:32.014
That dude just gets
more and more evil.

25:37.987 --> 25:39.921
[rumbling]

25:39.989 --> 25:41.990
[wind blowing]

25:57.407 --> 25:59.708
[glass breaking]
[bedford grunting]

26:07.784 --> 26:09.885
[elevator dings]

26:23.499 --> 26:25.400
[screaming]

26:28.404 --> 26:30.872
[groaning]

26:33.943 --> 26:35.877
[alarm]

26:39.282 --> 26:42.050
It's you!

26:43.252 --> 26:45.320
No, you're wrong.

26:45.388 --> 26:47.722
I'm not the one
you should punish!

26:50.226 --> 26:52.127
No!

26:52.195 --> 26:53.495
No!

26:53.563 --> 26:55.564
No!

26:55.631 --> 26:57.632
[screaming]

27:03.319 --> 27:04.986
Was he injured?
only his ego.

27:05.054 --> 27:06.254
I heard that when
maintenance finally

27:06.322 --> 27:07.756
Pried open
the elevator door,

27:07.824 --> 27:09.991
They found the president
curled up in the fetal
position.

27:10.059 --> 27:11.893
I only wish
i could have been
there to see it.

27:11.961 --> 27:14.396
Eli, he's a person.
a haunted person

27:14.464 --> 27:16.898
Who has a ghost
that we can't cross over

27:16.966 --> 27:19.234
Until we find out
what happened
between them.

27:19.302 --> 27:20.502
Wait a minute,
what do you mean,

27:20.570 --> 27:21.737
What happened between them?
do we think that tina

27:21.804 --> 27:23.405
Was sleeping with both
morgan and bedford?

27:23.473 --> 27:24.840
I don't know
about that,

27:24.907 --> 27:26.074
But i do know
one thing that
they both wanted.

27:26.142 --> 27:28.477
You asked me to look
for a connection,
right?

27:28.544 --> 27:30.145
Well, i think
i found one.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.447
Right around
the time that tina
went missing,

27:32.515 --> 27:35.016
Bedford became
president of
the university.

27:35.084 --> 27:36.585
Guess who he was
running against.

27:36.652 --> 27:38.320
Dr. morgan.

27:38.388 --> 27:39.588
Who acted like
he'd been threatened before

27:39.655 --> 27:41.456
About his affair
with tina. yeah.

27:41.524 --> 27:43.091
But if bedford wanted
the affair to go public,

27:43.159 --> 27:44.893
Why would he be
at the club
threatening tina

27:44.961 --> 27:46.194
To get her
to leave town?

27:46.262 --> 27:47.796
You know what,
maybe it's the other
way around.

27:47.864 --> 27:50.499
Maybe bedford
was paying her
to go public

27:50.566 --> 27:52.033
And morgan was
threatening her

27:52.101 --> 27:53.402
To be quiet and then go.

27:53.469 --> 27:54.536
Yeah, but would either
one of those guys

27:54.604 --> 27:55.837
Threaten a girl's life
over a job?

27:55.905 --> 27:57.105
Hmm.

27:57.173 --> 27:59.641
What if it was about
more than the job?

27:59.709 --> 28:01.410
What if it was
about the book?

28:01.477 --> 28:05.480
Wasn't bedford managing
the sale of rockland's
rare book collection,

28:05.548 --> 28:07.182
The one
with our book in it?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.451
Till it got stolen
and ended up with us.

28:09.519 --> 28:11.520
So you think
that bedford knew
about the book, then?

28:11.587 --> 28:12.821
I'm sure
the shadows did.

28:12.889 --> 28:14.423
There must be some
reason why they don't

28:14.490 --> 28:15.824
Want you talking
to him.

28:15.892 --> 28:17.859
Oh, if the wrong people
got a hold of that thing...

28:17.927 --> 28:19.027
Bedford's president now.

28:19.095 --> 28:20.729
He'd have total
control over it.

28:20.797 --> 28:23.198
Maybe that's what
he's been after all along.

28:29.071 --> 28:31.740
You want to tell me
why you're going around
asking questions

28:31.808 --> 28:33.375
About me and tina clark?

28:33.443 --> 28:34.743
And the day after
you're asking these questions,

28:34.811 --> 28:37.245
It's in the news
that she's dead?

28:37.313 --> 28:39.314
Doesn't that sound
strange to you?

28:39.382 --> 28:40.682
No.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.985
No, the only thing
that seems strange
to me is this--

28:44.053 --> 28:45.520
From the day i got here,

28:45.588 --> 28:46.955
You know, i've been
defending you

28:47.023 --> 28:49.391
Against people who say
you're too hard
on your staff.

28:49.459 --> 28:50.826
And you know
what i tell them?

28:50.893 --> 28:52.160
I tell them
it's because you care.

28:52.228 --> 28:54.863
You care about us,
you care about
our patients.

28:54.931 --> 28:57.866
And because
you're an honest man.

28:57.934 --> 29:00.202
But ever since
this tina thing started,

29:00.269 --> 29:02.737
No, doctor, you have not
been an honest man.

29:02.805 --> 29:04.406
You're angry at me?

29:04.474 --> 29:07.676
No. you're
stonewalling me.

29:07.743 --> 29:10.412
Why is that,
dr. morgan?

29:13.182 --> 29:15.617
You're right.
i'm sorry.

29:15.685 --> 29:18.053
I just don't know how.
if you're sorry,

29:18.120 --> 29:20.755
Stop lying
and tell me
what happened.

29:22.124 --> 29:24.326
Some people call it
a perk of my job.

29:24.393 --> 29:26.161
I call it
a waste of my time,

29:26.229 --> 29:28.797
But attending surgeons
are wined and dined

29:28.865 --> 29:30.799
By sales reps all the time.

29:30.867 --> 29:33.034
This one night,

29:33.102 --> 29:36.037
The sales reps
dragged me
to a strip club.

29:36.105 --> 29:38.907
[indistinct chatter]

29:49.752 --> 29:52.053
I'm not going to pretend
i didn't look.

29:54.123 --> 29:57.025
But i really wasn't
in the mood.

29:57.093 --> 30:00.762
So i went outside
to get some air.

30:02.598 --> 30:04.432
On the way out,
i passed

30:04.500 --> 30:06.234
A partially opened door.

30:06.302 --> 30:09.971
I glanced inside,
and i saw tina

30:10.039 --> 30:12.607
Giving someone
a private dance.

30:12.675 --> 30:15.143
It would have
ended there, but...

30:15.211 --> 30:16.878
She looked up
and saw me.

30:16.946 --> 30:18.947
Soon as i got outside,

30:19.015 --> 30:20.782
She was running
to catch me.

30:20.850 --> 30:22.651
Dr. morgan!

30:22.718 --> 30:24.653
No, please wait!

30:24.720 --> 30:27.455
She needed to tell me
that she only danced
to pay her tuition bills.

30:27.523 --> 30:28.857
I told her it was
none of my business.

30:28.925 --> 30:30.926
You've got
to understand!

30:30.993 --> 30:33.962
But...she was so ashamed,
she couldn't stop crying.

30:35.631 --> 30:38.433
I gave her my shoulder.

30:38.501 --> 30:40.669
But it didn't take long

30:40.736 --> 30:43.538
For it to turn into
something more.

30:46.475 --> 30:49.077
Didn't you try
to break it off?

30:49.145 --> 30:50.378
A hundred times.

30:50.446 --> 30:52.747
I'm not saying
that i don't share
the blame,

30:52.815 --> 30:54.049
But tina had problems.

30:54.116 --> 30:55.884
She had an addictive
personality,

30:55.952 --> 30:57.519
And not just
about us, either.

30:57.587 --> 30:59.287
Do you think
she was stealing meds?

30:59.355 --> 31:02.958
I never caught her,
but i recognized
the behavior.

31:03.025 --> 31:04.192
And i'm pretty sure
she was using.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.227
How did it end?

31:06.295 --> 31:08.463
My old friend,
josh bedford.

31:08.531 --> 31:10.899
President bedford?
you guys are friends?

31:10.967 --> 31:12.000
Were.

31:12.068 --> 31:14.235
Josh came to see me

31:14.303 --> 31:15.470
Because he knew
about me and tina,

31:15.538 --> 31:17.672
And begged me
to break it off.
for my own good.

31:17.740 --> 31:21.676
See, he knew that i was
on the short list
for university president.

31:21.744 --> 31:24.613
What he failed
to mention was that
he was on that list, too.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.348
What did you do?

31:26.415 --> 31:28.249
Well, like a fool,
i did what he told me.

31:28.317 --> 31:29.751
I let him talk
to tina for me.

31:29.819 --> 31:31.252
What do you mean?
what do you think happened?

31:31.320 --> 31:32.921
She packed up overnight
and left.

31:32.989 --> 31:35.724
And somehow, news of our
relationship got out.

31:35.791 --> 31:39.160
And somehow,
the guy they picked
to be president

31:39.228 --> 31:41.596
Was the one person that
knew about me and tina.

31:41.664 --> 31:43.331
You think he got her
to disclose the affair?

31:43.399 --> 31:45.867
They find her dead body
on a street corner

31:45.935 --> 31:48.937
With a pile of cash
sitting at home in
a new, expensive place,

31:49.005 --> 31:51.539
When a month before
she was lap-dancing
to make ends meet.

31:51.607 --> 31:53.575
Now he's president,

31:53.643 --> 31:54.943
Handing out
millions of dollars
in research grants

31:55.011 --> 31:56.845
And construction
contracts.

31:56.912 --> 31:59.247
What do you think?

32:02.952 --> 32:04.953
[siren in distance]

32:11.961 --> 32:13.962
President bedford.

32:14.030 --> 32:16.765
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to find you?

32:16.832 --> 32:19.367
Not hard enough,
apparently.

32:19.435 --> 32:20.635
You're disappearing
every day.

32:20.703 --> 32:22.437
Your staff has no clue
where you are.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.372
Well, you could
ask my mother

32:24.440 --> 32:26.041
If she weren't
comatose.

32:26.108 --> 32:28.443
That's your mother?
yeah.

32:28.511 --> 32:32.147
I visit her every day
since the liver failure.

32:32.214 --> 32:33.581
Wow.

32:33.649 --> 32:35.617
I'm sorry to hear about that.

32:35.685 --> 32:38.620
So you got
something to get
off of your chest?

32:38.688 --> 32:41.356
Look, i know all about
your meetings with tina clark.

32:41.424 --> 32:42.757
And i know you probably
paid her off

32:42.825 --> 32:45.260
To go public about
her affair with dr. morgan.

32:45.327 --> 32:47.896
And i got
a pretty good idea why.

32:47.963 --> 32:49.397
You wanted
to become president.

32:49.465 --> 32:50.932
[chuckles]

32:51.000 --> 32:52.400
But not just so you keep
your foot on the necks

32:52.468 --> 32:54.335
Of professors you don't like.

32:54.403 --> 32:56.638
You wanted to control
the book.

32:57.707 --> 32:59.908
Look, i'm going
to give you some advice,

32:59.975 --> 33:02.343
And i suggest you don't
make me repeat it.

33:02.411 --> 33:07.048
Now some of what
you think you know
may be true,

33:07.116 --> 33:09.617
But it's just
part of the story.

33:09.685 --> 33:12.187
How do you know
how much i know?

33:12.254 --> 33:13.588
Because
if you knew more,

33:13.656 --> 33:15.190
You wouldn't be
babbling about it
where they could hear.

33:15.257 --> 33:16.357
"they"?

33:16.425 --> 33:19.294
Shut up and listen.

33:19.361 --> 33:20.695
It's true.

33:20.763 --> 33:23.098
I did pay off
dr. morgan's
stripper friend.

33:23.165 --> 33:25.633
But only to make her
leave town.

33:25.668 --> 33:27.135
Why?

33:27.203 --> 33:29.170
I was trying
to help my friend.

33:29.238 --> 33:30.772
It's the last decent
thing i've done

33:30.840 --> 33:32.874
In a long,
lone time.

33:32.942 --> 33:34.943
If you didn't leak it,
who did?

33:35.010 --> 33:38.313
Just before i found out
about forrest--

33:38.380 --> 33:40.782
Dr. morgan's affair,

33:40.850 --> 33:43.351
I had a meeting with one
of my old classmates

33:43.419 --> 33:47.922
Who was also one of
the college trustees.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.692
We were reminiscing
about something,

33:50.760 --> 33:53.595
And then suddenly
his face went blank.

33:56.265 --> 33:58.166
I thought he was having
an episode of some sort,

33:58.234 --> 33:59.501
But he wasn't.

33:59.568 --> 34:00.735
And then he said...
joshua...

34:00.803 --> 34:04.272
You are going to be
the next university president.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.975
All you have to do
is nothing.

34:07.042 --> 34:08.710
What are you talking
about, henry?

34:08.777 --> 34:11.880
The next thing i know,
he was back to his
normal self

34:11.947 --> 34:13.947
And apologizing
for having broken
my carafe.

34:14.016 --> 34:16.484
Oh! i'm sorry.

34:16.552 --> 34:19.754
Are you saying something
possessed your friend?

34:19.822 --> 34:21.156
Look, i don't know
what happened.

34:21.223 --> 34:22.623
All i know is,
the next day,

34:22.690 --> 34:24.893
The rumors about
dr. morgan were
flying around.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.594
I thought i was
the only one that
knew about it.

34:27.663 --> 34:28.929
Well, who do you think
spread the rumors?

34:28.998 --> 34:32.534
Two days after
i spoke to my friend,

34:32.601 --> 34:34.435
I was recruited
by the board

34:34.503 --> 34:37.038
To replace dr. morgan
as a candidate.

34:37.106 --> 34:38.706
Now one by one,

34:38.774 --> 34:40.875
Each candidate withdrew

34:40.943 --> 34:44.813
As skeletons
began falling out
of their closets.

34:46.382 --> 34:48.349
So you're asking me
to believe

34:48.417 --> 34:51.518
That you had nothing
to do with the smear campaign

34:51.587 --> 34:53.087
That got you appointed?

34:53.155 --> 34:56.558
And who is this "they"
that is so desperate
for you to be president?

34:56.625 --> 34:58.393
You already know
who they are.

34:58.460 --> 35:02.030
You know what?
i'm done being toyed with.

35:02.097 --> 35:04.966
The minute that you can
show me the slightest respect--

35:05.034 --> 35:07.802
Why do you think
i have treated you
this way?!

35:07.870 --> 35:09.838
Why do you think
i have tried

35:09.905 --> 35:12.607
To chase you away
from this university?

35:12.675 --> 35:15.076
I've been trying
to protect you.

35:15.144 --> 35:16.644
You and melinda.

35:16.712 --> 35:18.413
Melinda? how did you--

35:18.480 --> 35:20.281
Look, i've said
too much.

35:20.382 --> 35:21.583
Protect her from what?

35:21.650 --> 35:23.084
Is it the shadows?

35:23.152 --> 35:24.485
Are you trying to protect us
from the shadows?

35:24.553 --> 35:26.421
Stop asking
so many questions!

35:26.488 --> 35:28.690
Don't ask any
questions at all.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.868
Tina?

35:39.935 --> 35:41.536
I really need
to talk to you.

35:41.604 --> 35:43.171
Are you here?

35:43.239 --> 35:45.273
Tina?

35:46.675 --> 35:50.144
My husband and eli,

35:50.212 --> 35:52.814
They spoke to morgan
and bedford.

35:52.882 --> 35:54.282
I think
i understand now.

35:54.350 --> 35:56.050
You died so young,
that's hard to accept.

35:56.118 --> 35:58.186
And you needed
someone to blame,
and these two men--

35:58.254 --> 36:00.154
No, they had nothing
to do with how i died.

36:00.222 --> 36:01.656
So then why have you
been haunting them?

36:01.724 --> 36:03.458
I never haunted bedford.

36:03.525 --> 36:07.762
And forrest, well,
i loved him.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.764
But i was angry at him

36:09.832 --> 36:12.033
Until i heard what
you and your friends
were saying.

36:12.101 --> 36:14.702
That he never
asked bedford
to chase you away.

36:14.770 --> 36:17.238
Well, forrest was weak.

36:17.306 --> 36:19.641
Just like i was.

36:19.708 --> 36:22.277
He could never say no.

36:22.344 --> 36:24.646
And bedford, well...
[scraping]

36:24.713 --> 36:27.515
He was just trying
to protect his friend.

36:27.583 --> 36:30.084
[whispering]
but the truth is,

36:30.152 --> 36:32.787
They're the ones
who need protecting now.

36:32.855 --> 36:34.188
From what?

36:35.691 --> 36:38.960
I also heard what
you said about
president bedford,

36:39.028 --> 36:42.230
About what he could
control as president.

36:42.298 --> 36:43.698
You mean the book?
[scraping]

36:43.766 --> 36:45.533
So i asked some questions.

36:45.601 --> 36:47.969
You asked questions?
about the book?

36:48.037 --> 36:49.370
Well, who did you ask?

36:49.438 --> 36:51.606
Ghosts.

36:51.674 --> 36:52.907
There's so many.
[scraping]

36:52.975 --> 36:55.009
Especially here.

36:55.077 --> 36:58.846
In the hospital?
well, what do they say?

36:58.914 --> 37:00.648
They were scared.

37:00.716 --> 37:02.884
So they didn't say much.

37:02.952 --> 37:04.719
Eli said that
something

37:04.787 --> 37:07.221
Possessed a friend
of bedford's.

37:07.289 --> 37:08.356
Is it the shadows?

37:08.424 --> 37:10.425
Is that what the ghosts
are so scared of?

37:10.492 --> 37:12.393
Is that what you're
trying to protect
bedford and morgan from?

37:12.461 --> 37:16.898
Tina, please, what is
everyone so scared of?

37:17.933 --> 37:20.034
[whispering]

37:20.102 --> 37:21.970
Who's there?
[scraping]

37:22.037 --> 37:25.306
Is anyone there?

37:25.374 --> 37:28.376
Who are you?
is anyone there?

37:28.444 --> 37:30.445
[breathing heavily]

37:31.547 --> 37:33.081
[voices whispering]

37:33.148 --> 37:35.350
[gasping]

37:35.417 --> 37:36.818
No!

37:36.885 --> 37:38.419
What are you?

37:38.487 --> 37:41.222
[voices whispering]

37:41.290 --> 37:43.324
What do you want?

37:43.392 --> 37:44.926
[scraping]

37:51.635 --> 37:53.203
Eli: so what was it?
a ghost?

37:53.871 --> 37:55.072
Different than any ghost
i've ever met.

37:55.139 --> 37:56.306
What do you mean?

37:56.374 --> 37:57.708
It was like it could
get inside me,

37:57.775 --> 38:00.744
And all i felt was
cold, fear and hate.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.479
Then it just disappeared?

38:02.547 --> 38:03.847
Sort of.

38:03.915 --> 38:08.485
It was uncoiling like
this band of cold
slithering off me.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.789
Tina's here.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.257
She's just keeping
her distance.

38:14.325 --> 38:15.759
Did you tell him
what i can do?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.160
Yeah, i did.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.929
A month ago, i would
have booted him
out of the hospital.

38:18.996 --> 38:21.765
But recently,
you felt like
tina was here?

38:23.167 --> 38:25.902
So this light
that she's supposed
to go into,

38:25.970 --> 38:29.005
She stayed back
because of me?

38:29.073 --> 38:30.340
You have
to ask her that.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.843
Is she here?

38:34.312 --> 38:38.482
I don't know
where to begin.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.420
I'm so sorry
for what happened.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.188
I was your teacher.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.023
I never should have
let us get involved.

38:47.091 --> 38:48.658
Tell him
that he's right,

38:48.726 --> 38:52.129
But that it's
my fault just as
much as it is his.

38:52.196 --> 38:55.432
She says
it's her fault, too.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.534
But if i played a part
in leading her down
a path to her death...

38:57.602 --> 38:59.436
No, i had
a pill problem

38:59.504 --> 39:00.971
Long before
i met forrest.

39:01.038 --> 39:03.440
Her addiction was there
long before you were.

39:03.508 --> 39:07.010
So what's kept her here?
how can i help her move on?

39:07.078 --> 39:09.813
I made so many mistakes.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.682
Like not believing
in myself

39:12.750 --> 39:15.652
And running away from
things when i really
should have faced them.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.654
But the one thing
that i always did

39:17.722 --> 39:20.857
Was i took
the easy way out.

39:20.925 --> 39:22.626
You know, the easy money,

39:22.693 --> 39:24.194
The easy relationship.

39:24.262 --> 39:27.330
She always chose
the easy way out,

39:27.398 --> 39:29.099
The easy relationship.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.468
Didn't take any work.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.004
Do nothing,
we stay together.

39:34.071 --> 39:37.274
Do nothing,
and it eventually ends.

39:37.341 --> 39:38.909
Eli: just like bedford.

39:38.976 --> 39:39.976
That's what they told him,

39:40.044 --> 39:41.745
Do nothing and you'll
become president.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.481
Tina: but i'm not going
to do that now.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.484
I'm not going to leave
forrest alone now,
or bedford.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.352
Even he's not
to blame for this.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.087
Tina, i know
you want to
protect them,

39:51.155 --> 39:52.189
But i don't think
you can.

39:52.256 --> 39:53.356
How do you know that?

39:53.424 --> 39:55.258
You said it
yourself.

39:55.326 --> 39:56.426
Ghosts are scared.

39:56.494 --> 39:57.928
Whatever
this thing is,

39:57.995 --> 40:00.931
It can hurt them,
and they don't have
the power to stop it.

40:00.998 --> 40:02.566
Well then, who can?

40:02.633 --> 40:04.634
I don't know.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.536
But i'm going
to find out.

40:06.604 --> 40:09.272
Tina, whatever
this thing is,

40:09.340 --> 40:13.043
It can't mean more
than you being
where you belong.

40:13.110 --> 40:15.712
Can you see the light?

40:15.780 --> 40:19.549
Look for the light.

40:19.617 --> 40:22.352
She can see it,
she just doesn't
want to go in.

40:22.420 --> 40:26.389
If you want to help me,
move into the light.

40:26.457 --> 40:30.260
Why?

40:30.328 --> 40:32.596
All the time
that we were together,

40:32.663 --> 40:35.599
I told myself
that i was good for you.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.869
But i really wasn't.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.471
I want to be good for you.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.707
Once.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.376
Please.

40:53.050 --> 40:56.653
Tell him i don't know
if we were good
for each other...

41:00.658 --> 41:05.795
But he--he was
the best thing i ever had.

41:05.863 --> 41:08.298
I will.

41:32.790 --> 41:35.525
Melinda: she's gone.

41:42.833 --> 41:48.405
Please, mother,
chopin isn't muzak.

41:49.607 --> 41:51.841
Now if you don't
pipe down,

41:51.909 --> 41:55.045
I won't read you
your jane austen.

41:55.112 --> 41:57.314
Where were we, hmm?

41:57.381 --> 41:59.549
Page 293.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.654
"but no such
happy marriage

42:04.722 --> 42:06.856
"could now teach
the admiring multitude

42:06.924 --> 42:09.693
What connubial felicity
really was"--

42:09.760 --> 42:11.161
[static]

42:11.228 --> 42:13.563
[electricity flickering]

42:13.631 --> 42:16.833
"the, uh, union
of a different tendency,

42:16.901 --> 42:18.735
And precluding
the possible"--

42:18.803 --> 42:21.438
[static]

42:21.505 --> 42:23.807
Leave her alone.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.108
She's helpless.

42:25.176 --> 42:28.645
She can't even
open her eyes,
for god sake.

42:28.713 --> 42:32.549
In the middle
of the night,

42:32.616 --> 42:34.484
When no one is looking,

42:34.552 --> 42:38.788
I'm going to go
to that machine
over there,

42:38.856 --> 42:42.192
The one
that keeps me alive,

42:42.259 --> 42:44.561
And unplug it.

42:44.628 --> 42:48.465
I will slowly die, josh.

42:48.532 --> 42:50.133
It will be painful.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.936
And it will be
on your head.

42:54.372 --> 42:56.673
Why are you
doing this to her?

42:56.741 --> 42:59.042
You have no right.

42:59.110 --> 43:02.946
I've done everything
you've asked.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.415
You've been sharing
our business.

43:05.483 --> 43:08.418
That's not acceptable, josh.

43:08.486 --> 43:11.287
You will pay a price.

43:11.355 --> 43:14.090
I won't let you hurt her.

43:14.158 --> 43:17.994
If i have to keep
a nurse in here
24 hours a day,

43:18.062 --> 43:19.996
I will do whatever it takes.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.798
Do you hear me?

43:21.866 --> 43:22.932
Do you hear me?!

43:23.000 --> 43:24.768
[monitor beeping]

43:24.835 --> 43:27.370
[static]
nurse!

43:28.572 --> 43:30.774
I need a nurse!
someone, please!
