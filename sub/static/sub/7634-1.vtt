03:42.430 --> 03:43.820
All right. Mom is all right, baby.

03:44.673 --> 03:46.731
Just got to take my medication,
that is all.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.042
You boys know how much your
mama love you, don't you?

04:00.499 --> 04:01.851
-We love you too, mommy.
-We love you too, mommy.

04:05.757 --> 04:06.768
Roeme, sit down.

04:08.427 --> 04:09.309
Sit down!

04:15.261 --> 04:17.046
All right, Ray-Ray,
tie this around Mommy's arm.

04:17.146 --> 04:19.625
Nice and tight
until you see that big vein.

04:19.725 --> 04:21.639
Why do I always have to do it?

04:21.738 --> 04:23.548
Why do you never ask Roemello?

04:23.648 --> 04:24.905
Baby, please.

04:25.737 --> 04:28.019
Just like I told you before, baby.

04:29.406 --> 04:30.955
Because you're the oldest sweetheart.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.432
And your Mama is sick.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.076
Please.

04:39.149 --> 04:41.733
Just tie this around my arm,
nice and tight, baby,

04:41.833 --> 04:43.087
until you see that big vein.

04:43.177 --> 04:44.816
Pull on it for Mama. Please.

04:45.782 --> 04:46.958
Tight, baby.

04:47.058 --> 04:48.558
Tight! God damn it!

04:52.757 --> 04:54.847
That's it. That's it.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.277
OK. OK, OK, OK, OK.

05:09.188 --> 05:11.160
OK, OK. OK.

06:12.013 --> 06:12.863
Mama?

06:13.755 --> 06:14.788
Mom?

06:16.635 --> 06:19.480
Mommy, what's happening?
What's happening?

06:19.580 --> 06:22.260
Mom! What's wrong?

06:25.839 --> 06:27.858
Mama! Mama! What is it?

06:27.948 --> 06:29.435
Mama, what's happening to you?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.343
Roeme! Do something!

06:35.696 --> 06:36.673
No.

06:43.984 --> 06:44.834
Mama!

06:46.742 --> 06:48.059
No, please!

06:51.543 --> 06:53.878
No! Don't go! Please.

06:56.373 --> 06:57.906
Mommy! Mommy!

06:59.055 --> 06:59.905
Mom...

07:01.249 --> 07:02.422
No, mom!

07:03.967 --> 07:06.508
-Mom.
-Mama.

08:02.145 --> 08:03.068
<i>Dear mother.</i>

08:05.994 --> 08:08.199
<i>It seems like an eternity
since you have been gone.</i>

08:10.534 --> 08:11.934
<i>So much has happened.</i>

08:13.466 --> 08:16.912
<i>So many dreams turn into nightmares.</i>

08:19.587 --> 08:21.347
<i>You always wanted the best for me.</i>

08:22.931 --> 08:24.911
<i>But I guess
it was not meant to be that way.</i>

08:32.259 --> 08:34.614
<i>Sugarhill,
where you always wanted us to live...</i>

08:35.889 --> 08:37.046
<i>...is now a memory.</i>

08:40.472 --> 08:41.933
<i>A burned out jungle.</i>

08:42.807 --> 08:45.134
<i>A ghost of better days.</i>

08:45.224 --> 08:46.224
<i>Like my father.</i>

08:46.802 --> 08:49.136
<i>Lost, out of reach.</i>

08:51.056 --> 08:52.262
<i>And the boy you loved...</i>

08:53.402 --> 08:54.894
<i>...has become the man you feared.</i>

08:55.605 --> 08:58.337
<i>Getting rich of the same poison
that killed you,</i>

08:58.437 --> 08:59.741
<i>and destroyed my father.</i>

09:00.710 --> 09:03.989
<i>Partners with the same men
that stripped away our family dignity.</i>

09:05.943 --> 09:07.501
<i>Uneasy partners.</i>

09:08.118 --> 09:09.658
<i>Tied together by time...</i>

09:10.423 --> 09:11.273
<i>...fear...</i>

09:12.364 --> 09:13.345
<i>...and greed.</i>

09:18.376 --> 09:21.849
<i>Me and my brother control the same streets
where we once played as kids.</i>

09:23.456 --> 09:25.012
<i>We had hoped for a different life.</i>

09:32.621 --> 09:33.852
<i>But time's change.</i>

09:36.366 --> 09:37.500
<i>People change.</i>

09:42.068 --> 09:45.823
<i>From Convent to Saint Nick,
the streets are mine.</i>

10:09.428 --> 10:10.937
<i>I'm sorry I let you down.</i>

10:15.138 --> 10:16.652
<i>I'm consumed by chaos.</i>

10:19.524 --> 10:20.894
<i>Consumed by guilt.</i>

10:26.239 --> 10:28.442
<i>Consumed by grief.</i>

10:30.734 --> 10:31.824
<i>May God forgive me.</i>

11:36.675 --> 11:38.240
-Let me tell you something.
-All right.

11:38.809 --> 11:41.484
That is one nigger in here
you don't want to get next to.

11:41.574 --> 11:42.424
Why not?

11:43.143 --> 11:45.358
Because he is in the catering business.
You hear me?

11:45.448 --> 11:46.298
What?

11:47.187 --> 11:49.147
-I am going to put it to you straight.
-All right.

11:49.567 --> 11:52.044
That nigger serves up more heroin
in Harlem,

11:52.135 --> 11:54.848
-than McDonald's serve hamburgers.
-Stop lying.

11:55.473 --> 11:57.151
-You are tripping.
-Are you tripping.

11:57.251 --> 11:58.457
-I was just...
-I do. What.

12:10.580 --> 12:11.430
Thanks.

12:17.638 --> 12:19.362
-Can I buy you a drink?
-No!

12:21.322 --> 12:22.901
-No?
-No.

12:24.772 --> 12:27.568
-Well, then, can I talk to you then?
-I don't know, can you?

12:32.110 --> 12:33.789
-What's your name?
-What?

12:34.080 --> 12:35.872
-What's your name?
-Melissa.

12:36.413 --> 12:37.662
-Melissa.
-Yeah.

12:38.703 --> 12:39.553
Melissa.

12:40.073 --> 12:42.843
-What's your name?
-Roemeo.

12:47.409 --> 12:48.340
Are you serious?

12:48.715 --> 12:52.786
-No, and you're funny.
-And you're very funny as well.

12:52.876 --> 12:55.529
-You're funny and you're fine.
-Oh, thank you so much.

12:55.619 --> 12:57.765
And you've got a tag
hanging on your dress.

13:02.483 --> 13:04.016
I'm returning this bad boy tomorrow.

13:04.106 --> 13:05.558
-Is that right?
-That's right.

13:05.648 --> 13:06.815
Is that right?

13:07.490 --> 13:10.530
Well, you know, I don't seen
a lot of girls come and go around here.

13:13.692 --> 13:14.550
Be careful.

13:16.197 --> 13:18.995
Of what? People like you?

13:21.965 --> 13:22.964
I'm just here to help.

13:23.942 --> 13:25.117
I said, thank you.

13:26.928 --> 13:27.778
I know.

14:09.471 --> 14:10.321
Dad?

14:12.113 --> 14:14.558
Ray? Anybody home?

14:16.553 --> 14:17.403
Dad!

14:21.023 --> 14:22.023
Oh, no.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.117
Stop it!

14:26.311 --> 14:28.208
Gus! Gus, Gus. No!

14:28.383 --> 14:29.691
I'll give your money back!

14:29.781 --> 14:30.631
Dad!

14:31.671 --> 14:33.101
I'll get the money back!

14:34.332 --> 14:35.697
-Stop!
-You stop!

14:39.608 --> 14:40.944
Dad! Please, wait!

14:41.035 --> 14:42.251
What is wrong with you!

14:43.045 --> 14:45.740
Did I not tell you!
Didn't I fucking tell you?

14:45.830 --> 14:46.863
-Oh, God!
-You screwed my money!

14:46.953 --> 14:48.450
You junky piece of shit.

14:48.942 --> 14:50.627
Gus, no! Please no!

14:50.717 --> 14:52.539
You fuck! Didn't I tell you?

14:53.714 --> 14:55.156
You screw with my money!

14:55.836 --> 14:57.925
-You think it grows on fucking trees!
-Not in front of my boys!

14:58.015 --> 14:59.574
-Get back, kid!
-Wait!

15:00.123 --> 15:02.322
-Stay down!
-You think you can rip me off?

15:02.412 --> 15:04.789
-Wait! Please...
-Gus, I am sorry!

15:05.533 --> 15:08.748
Please, God, no, Gus!
Don't let him do this!

15:09.414 --> 15:11.260
Not in front of my kids!

15:12.788 --> 15:14.470
-Shut the fuck up!
-No!

15:14.753 --> 15:16.307
-Please stop!
-Shut up.

15:16.621 --> 15:17.471
Please!

15:18.298 --> 15:19.430
Gus, I made a mistake!

15:19.892 --> 15:23.094
-I trusted you, you junky piece of shit!
-Please don't let him do this!

15:23.761 --> 15:25.008
Please stop.

15:25.260 --> 15:26.437
Stop, please.

15:26.604 --> 15:27.454
Enough!

15:27.623 --> 15:30.266
Please God, no God. Gus, Gus!

15:30.356 --> 15:32.431
Up. Up. Up.

15:32.522 --> 15:33.808
Give that to me! Fuck!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.264
No! Don't shoot! No!

15:35.354 --> 15:36.204
Gus!

16:38.924 --> 16:39.774
Hey, Ro.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.502
How long you been standing there?

16:45.722 --> 16:46.585
Not long.

16:52.246 --> 16:55.733
You know how many times
I beeped you tonight?

16:56.396 --> 16:57.263
Yeah, I know.

16:58.115 --> 17:00.195
-You beeped me four times.
-Four times?

17:00.285 --> 17:01.135
Four times.

17:03.739 --> 17:04.894
You been busy?

17:06.102 --> 17:08.211
-Too busy for me?
-Oh, come on now.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.694
Look here I brought you something.

17:12.569 --> 17:14.455
-I need a dentist.
-A what?

17:16.246 --> 17:17.679
What, you plan on kissing somebody?

17:20.210 --> 17:21.623
No, my chops is hurting.

17:23.092 --> 17:24.844
All right, man. I'll set it up all right?

17:26.924 --> 17:27.837
Try a little of this.

17:33.807 --> 17:35.946
Shit it is hot. What is it?

17:36.236 --> 17:39.863
It is noodles. Chicken noodles
with some scallions.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.177
Food.

17:44.001 --> 17:47.664
Hey, how you like my haircut?

17:53.133 --> 17:53.983
It's nice.

17:54.841 --> 17:55.691
Very nice.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.963
It is my church boy haircut.

17:58.415 --> 17:59.768
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

18:00.518 --> 18:01.537
I told Cliff.

18:02.556 --> 18:04.772
I says, you will not cut my hair
like no hood.

18:06.841 --> 18:08.548
I want a church boy haircut.

18:09.597 --> 18:10.759
You should eat more, Dad.

18:13.356 --> 18:14.437
Here, take some of this.

18:20.519 --> 18:21.403
Put it in your mouth.

18:23.986 --> 18:24.862
OK.

18:26.364 --> 18:27.370
Put it in your mouth.

18:34.746 --> 18:35.662
Where Ray?

18:37.710 --> 18:38.845
Where Raynathan?

18:39.964 --> 18:41.372
You got it all over yourself.

18:44.333 --> 18:49.001
He does not come around to see me anymore.

19:01.255 --> 19:02.652
I am going back to church.

19:06.157 --> 19:10.477
This is my last night of getting high.

19:14.581 --> 19:15.913
What do you think about that?

19:20.335 --> 19:21.185
Come on.

19:22.921 --> 19:24.157
What you want me to say, Papa?

19:38.802 --> 19:40.553
It is already broke, Ro.

19:42.614 --> 19:43.768
It is not your fault.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.035
You can not fix it.

19:49.359 --> 19:50.238
All right?

19:55.233 --> 19:57.401
I just want you to be proud of me.

20:07.534 --> 20:10.478
-How you doing Augustus?
-Oh, I feel fine. How you doing?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.884
-I feel good too.
-That's all right, I feel real good.

20:17.553 --> 20:20.973
-You sure you do not want to count?
-Do I have to count it?

20:21.723 --> 20:24.144
Here, here, buy a lollypop.

20:27.655 --> 20:28.612
How is your brother?

20:29.191 --> 20:30.041
My brother...

20:30.741 --> 20:31.808
My brother is fine.

20:33.073 --> 20:35.126
You know, he's driving me nuts.

20:35.664 --> 20:39.240
Is that right? Well, it's a black thing.
You don't understand.

20:48.552 --> 20:49.746
Hey what's up, you all?

20:50.084 --> 20:51.521
-We are chilling.
-Black man.

20:52.388 --> 20:53.634
-Any problems?
-No, everything is all right.

20:53.724 --> 20:54.635
-Am I bleeding?
-No.

20:54.725 --> 20:56.010
-Cool.
-Bye bye.

21:00.883 --> 21:02.603
-You ever seen that kid before?
-Never, man.

21:03.102 --> 21:05.348
Keep an eye on that tourist
"Inaudible" motherfucker.

21:06.026 --> 21:07.233
-YG.
-What's up?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.888
-Good.
-Any problems?

21:09.019 --> 21:10.900
-Everything is cool up here.
-Good. All right.

21:10.990 --> 21:13.311
-Well, it's still early, man.
-Watch out for you life, man.

21:18.026 --> 21:18.904
Get him! Get him!

21:20.793 --> 21:22.462
Now you guys just take care of him now!

21:22.881 --> 21:24.830
Hey, man,
Gus has a pickup for us downtown.

21:25.258 --> 21:26.098
Can you handle it?

21:26.188 --> 21:28.302
I will take YG with me
and take care of it.

21:28.498 --> 21:31.626
Oh, Roemello, the mellow fellow.

21:33.038 --> 21:34.799
-What is up!
-Kymie, what you doing here, man?

21:34.889 --> 21:37.368
I thought you was out at Amityville
with them ghosts and shit.

21:37.886 --> 21:40.606
Hey, no. You know, chilling.
You know, hanging out.

21:41.076 --> 21:42.413
You see, my niggers in my neighborhood,

21:42.503 --> 21:44.092
they act clank,
you know what I am saying?

21:44.182 --> 21:44.684
Is that right?

21:44.774 --> 21:46.554
Each and every one of them
swears they hard,

21:46.644 --> 21:48.013
when they are soft as butter.

21:48.899 --> 21:50.609
Well. You know,
you are kind of stupid, man.

21:50.699 --> 21:53.918
I mean, you've got a nice hood,
and a nice house with nice folks.

21:54.023 --> 21:55.827
But you still want to come back
to the jungle.

21:56.199 --> 21:58.266
You keep fucking around
and something might happen to you.

21:58.356 --> 22:01.351
Right. You sound like my father, man.
All right? Check it.

22:01.441 --> 22:02.536
There is nothing
that is going to happen to me, all right?

22:02.626 --> 22:04.571
So stop sweating me.
There is nothing going to happen to me.

22:04.661 --> 22:06.377
-So what? You got a gank!
-Right.

22:06.865 --> 22:08.083
That makes you a big man now?

22:08.417 --> 22:09.902
Damn right, it makes me a big man.

22:09.992 --> 22:11.721
What the fuck is wrong with you,
toy nigger?

22:12.191 --> 22:13.333
All right, Cool. Check it.

22:13.996 --> 22:16.349
I do know what is going on out here.
I am going to prove it to you.

22:16.439 --> 22:17.824
I will put two in somebody's head.

22:18.176 --> 22:20.946
-And you know we could kick it, you know.
-Kymie, get the fuck out!

22:21.189 --> 22:23.352
-I am going...
-Get the fuck out of here.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.724
Come on now I do not want to see you
in the black, man.

22:26.814 --> 22:27.814
All right, I get it, man.

22:28.193 --> 22:29.395
All right. You stay all right.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.676
At this time, Savior Prep is pleased

22:32.766 --> 22:36.825
to present the recipients
of our senior scholarship awards.

22:37.563 --> 22:42.751
So now, let's offer our congratulations
to Roemello Skuggs.

22:46.922 --> 22:49.904
Who has been awarded
a full academic scholarship

22:49.994 --> 22:51.841
to Georgetown University.

22:52.635 --> 22:56.763
Roemello's hard work and bright future,
set a wonderful example

22:56.853 --> 22:58.684
for our young people of today.

23:10.734 --> 23:12.236
Honey, come on, will you!

23:12.764 --> 23:17.068
Speaking in foreign language.

23:20.317 --> 23:21.706
I come to say good night, Sal.

23:23.122 --> 23:25.882
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Good night.

23:31.665 --> 23:32.665
What is up, man?

23:34.078 --> 23:35.706
Trying to save your brother's life, man.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.501
-Smoke it.
-Smoke it.

23:40.815 --> 23:42.512
You know he is going to be bad,
don't you?

23:42.975 --> 23:43.825
Yeah.

23:45.351 --> 23:46.981
In our day, we used to play RCK.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.428
Now everybody
wants to be a fucking gangster.

24:00.788 --> 24:02.877
Those are the Nigerians
I was telling you about, man.

24:03.923 --> 24:06.657
The motherfuckers maybe getting
their shift from Pakistan, right?

24:06.747 --> 24:10.365
Then it goes to Legos, then they bring
it over here in diplomatic pouches, man.

24:10.455 --> 24:12.171
They be rocking the Bronx with that shit.

24:12.533 --> 24:13.466
Is that right?

24:14.578 --> 24:15.428
Funny.

24:16.340 --> 24:19.094
At one time, we used to look to them
for our history and our culture.

24:20.630 --> 24:23.770
If you want history and culture,
you read "National Geographic" and shit.

24:24.771 --> 24:26.469
I tell you man, you know,
we get with these motherfuckers, man,

24:26.559 --> 24:28.685
we can get out of bed with Gus
and the rest of those Wop,

24:28.775 --> 24:31.637
Ginny motherfuckers, man,
like a bunch of cheap two-dollar whores.

24:31.806 --> 24:33.594
Well, listen, motherfucker,
go over and take care of some business.

24:33.684 --> 24:34.556
Come on.

24:35.184 --> 24:37.492
Hey! Untombe!

24:39.488 --> 24:40.338
How are you?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.136
I am good. How you doing Raynathan?

24:43.226 --> 24:44.192
-How are you?
-Very good.

24:44.282 --> 24:45.454
How's it going?

24:46.007 --> 24:48.401
This my brother, Roemello, here.

24:48.712 --> 24:50.489
-It is a pleasure.
-I told you all about him.

24:50.579 --> 24:51.513
How you doing?

24:52.372 --> 24:55.549
So, what is the deal?

24:56.129 --> 24:57.954
Well, we been thinking
about this, Raynathan,

24:58.044 --> 24:59.663
and we just... It won't work.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.227
We can't work with that Akata.

25:01.799 --> 25:03.241
-You know, you do your thing...
-Wait, wait! No, wait.

25:03.331 --> 25:04.611
-...we do our thing.
-Wait, wait.

25:06.174 --> 25:10.716
All right, this is my brother.
He is a very, very busy man.

25:10.806 --> 25:12.754
I understand.
This is not a personal thing.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.312
It is something we have just...
We can not do it.

25:15.844 --> 25:16.901
Hey! Hey!

25:23.484 --> 25:25.077
Calm down, man. Just calm down.

25:26.411 --> 25:27.261
I am sorry. Look...

25:28.613 --> 25:31.122
...my brother was under the impression
that you wanted to do some business.

25:31.212 --> 25:33.657
Maybe we can just have a seat,
have a drink,

25:33.747 --> 25:35.587
maybe sit down,
have a nice little diatribe.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.579
Let us see if we can work this out.

25:37.857 --> 25:39.417
Don't take this personally, Roemello.

25:39.626 --> 25:42.389
It won't work. You do your thing.
I do my thing, you know.

25:42.995 --> 25:44.885
It won't work. We can't work with Akata.

25:45.190 --> 25:46.760
Akata, Akata.

25:47.093 --> 25:48.335
What is this Akata shit?

25:49.431 --> 25:51.221
-Black American.
-Oh, shit.

25:51.786 --> 25:52.720
Cotton picker.

26:03.068 --> 26:04.019
You know something?

26:05.613 --> 26:07.430
I read this article in "The Times" today.

26:09.781 --> 26:11.167
It said that people like us...

26:12.573 --> 26:16.106
...should be place
in front of a firing squad, and shot.

26:19.474 --> 26:20.590
Fuck that shit, man.

26:21.326 --> 26:22.949
The motherfucker
that should be blindfolded

26:23.039 --> 26:25.092
and stood up against the wall
is Charles Oakley.

26:25.288 --> 26:29.095
Can't even make a god damn layup
underneath the board by himself.

26:29.185 --> 26:30.799
Change that nigger! Shit!

26:37.589 --> 26:38.521
What's up, man?

26:42.061 --> 26:43.904
You are acting strangely, Roemello,
man, I...

26:46.277 --> 26:47.610
...I got to tell you the truth, though.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.117
I mean, this shit is beginning
to effect the business.

26:51.656 --> 26:53.576
I mean, I beep you, you don't pick up.

26:55.545 --> 26:57.415
You come on block man and like...

26:58.248 --> 27:00.167
...you act like
you do not want to be there Ro.

27:01.910 --> 27:03.209
What is up? Are you all right?

27:05.293 --> 27:06.169
What's up?

27:07.683 --> 27:08.639
Maybe I do not.

27:14.343 --> 27:15.272
You OK, man?

27:43.619 --> 27:44.503
I know him well.

27:46.037 --> 27:47.764
We call him "Lolly," for Lollypop.

27:49.926 --> 27:51.731
He's been very effective in Red Hook.

27:52.714 --> 27:53.841
This ain't Red Hook.

27:54.843 --> 27:57.006
I don't even think
that this is the United States.

27:58.248 --> 27:59.248
This is Harlem.

28:00.350 --> 28:03.479
Why would you want to bring a guy here
from Red Hook to Harlem.

28:04.846 --> 28:06.310
The decision has already been made.

28:07.822 --> 28:09.520
Roemello is going to see through this.

28:12.327 --> 28:15.863
-So?
-He is not that easy to handle.

28:19.827 --> 28:21.292
Can I get a sandwich or something?

28:26.340 --> 28:28.091
Isn't Skugg's the kid who killed Sal?

28:31.180 --> 28:33.833
Nobody knows who killed Sal.
Do you hear that?

28:35.675 --> 28:36.525
Nobody!

28:38.566 --> 28:41.799
Hey, if I even thought
someone killed my cousin...

28:43.393 --> 28:44.485
...I'd take care of him.

28:56.776 --> 29:00.911
So... you ready for this Pow Wow today?

29:01.162 --> 29:03.568
Hey, man, there is something funny
about this meeting,8 Ray.

29:04.086 --> 29:06.550
I saw Gus yesterday
and he did not mention a thing about it.

29:06.994 --> 29:08.674
I do not know, man, something is going on.

29:08.959 --> 29:11.301
-You remember this guy Lolly, right?
-Yeah.

29:12.097 --> 29:14.503
Has been fighter. Sells crack in Brooklyn.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.105
A nobody.

29:20.937 --> 29:22.398
Now when people look at me...

29:23.675 --> 29:26.333
...they see success.

29:28.828 --> 29:30.159
You know who I owe that too?

29:31.332 --> 29:32.182
This man.

29:34.425 --> 29:35.275
Tony Adamo.

29:37.106 --> 29:37.963
And Gus here.

29:40.091 --> 29:42.446
Gus put you guys on
like you was fucking family.

29:44.495 --> 29:47.336
And we are family.

29:49.465 --> 29:51.247
Look, Lolly, is there a point to all this?

29:52.588 --> 29:55.424
I am trying to tell you to be open.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.345
Look, Gus, nobody is rocking anymore.

29:58.435 --> 30:01.843
Somebody is rocking, OK?
I am bringing my own clientele, Roemello.

30:02.302 --> 30:03.729
There is no need for conflict.

30:04.064 --> 30:06.863
All I need you to do is just cut me out
a little space to operate.

30:07.462 --> 30:08.870
I explained all this to Ray.

30:09.554 --> 30:11.742
No, wait, wait.
No, you didn't tell me like that.

30:12.443 --> 30:15.106
Roeme, it has come up.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.734
It can work.

30:18.374 --> 30:20.448
And we think it is good for everybody.

30:21.540 --> 30:22.406
Oh, you think.

30:23.461 --> 30:25.181
Well, I think
there is going to be conflict.

30:25.665 --> 30:26.515
Roeme.

30:27.051 --> 30:29.810
It's like Pop says, man.
It's like an apple and orange thing.

30:30.608 --> 30:33.283
It is like comparing Avion
with Pellegrino.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.225
Now wait a minute.
Don't patronize us, you fake cupcake,

30:36.315 --> 30:37.920
deputy dog, toy cop motherfucker.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.158
Hey, motherfucker, this is no cartoon.

30:40.248 --> 30:43.716
You know, I been noticing something, Ray.
You are getting a little sensitive, eh?

30:52.526 --> 30:54.096
Harry will take care of the precinct.

30:58.782 --> 31:00.150
Let us think about it for a while.

31:01.705 --> 31:03.375
Then we will get back to you, all right?

31:04.408 --> 31:06.485
Hey, man, that homeboy sounded like
he is coming correct, man.

31:06.575 --> 31:09.082
He got the legit aroma coming off of him,
it look like to me,

31:09.220 --> 31:11.632
What you think is going on in there?
What you know about him?

31:12.753 --> 31:14.709
No, man, it looks like
they want to lease a piece

31:14.799 --> 31:16.504
so they can scramble some eggs
of their own, man.

31:16.594 --> 31:18.071
-Shit.
-Besides, we getting paid rent.

31:18.161 --> 31:20.121
-There is no harm in that, right?
-That is the best case scenario.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.960
Now flip the script, what's the worst?

31:23.335 --> 31:25.186
What? They want the whole nine yards?

31:25.276 --> 31:27.018
Hen house, chicken coup,
scrambled eggs and all that?

31:27.108 --> 31:28.289
But Gus is not out
of his motherfucking mind, right?

31:28.379 --> 31:29.399
Gus? Gus?

31:30.013 --> 31:31.280
Oh, shit! Bull shit!

31:31.405 --> 31:33.491
All of a sudden
Gus is playing fucking Don King?

31:33.657 --> 31:34.657
Hooking up the brothers?

31:34.982 --> 31:35.832
That's bull shit!

31:36.854 --> 31:38.935
-Yo, man, look...
-I tell you look!

31:39.025 --> 31:40.346
Talking to Lolly without telling me.

31:40.436 --> 31:41.901
Look, man,
we just hanging at the joint, man.

31:41.991 --> 31:44.265
Kicking it like good fellows, man.
Just talking business, man.

31:44.355 --> 31:46.095
Why do you not just cut me
some slack, Jack.

31:47.918 --> 31:49.111
You're not being smart, Ray.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.251
Oh, I am not smart now.

31:54.327 --> 31:56.462
Hey, I'm your motherfucking
older brother, man!

31:56.728 --> 31:59.418
Fuck you, Ro, man!
I got Ideas too, man! Good ones!

31:59.975 --> 32:02.855
I keep trying to share them with you, man.
All you do is just piss on me!

32:04.626 --> 32:07.429
Ro, man.
Now we can be something together, man.

32:07.766 --> 32:11.747
We could be large. We could be large.
Way larger than anybody ever, man.

32:11.872 --> 32:14.227
Ray, we the low man
on the motherfucking totem pole, man.

32:14.677 --> 32:16.466
We just two brothers
trying to say alive in Harlem.

32:16.556 --> 32:18.063
Come on, what the fuck is that shit.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.272
Man, you talking like a pussy.

32:19.362 --> 32:20.969
Man, that is not like you
to talk scared like that.

32:21.059 --> 32:22.020
What is up with that.

32:24.881 --> 32:26.945
Ray, I am not scared, man.

32:27.691 --> 32:29.489
I just see something you don't.
That's it.

32:30.072 --> 32:31.974
Why don't you just cut me loose then, man.

32:37.585 --> 32:39.376
That is what
I been trying to tell you, Ray.

32:41.410 --> 32:42.715
I don't want to do this anymore.

32:44.728 --> 32:45.595
I'm out, man.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.525
-How did you find me?
-Harlem is a small place.

33:24.222 --> 33:25.497
It is way too small for me.

33:25.693 --> 33:27.031
Anyway, I'm glad you came out.

33:27.294 --> 33:29.136
Well, I just didn't have
nothing better to do.

33:29.386 --> 33:30.395
Oh, is that right?

33:31.851 --> 33:33.025
And what do you do?

33:33.468 --> 33:36.878
-I'm an actress.
-Really. What restaurant?

34:14.429 --> 34:15.967
-You're making fun of me?
-The serious "Inaudible."

34:16.058 --> 34:18.731
You making fun of me?
You making fun of my walk or what?

34:20.491 --> 34:22.292
It is smooth, just kind of a glide.

34:40.833 --> 34:42.591
<i>When it takes</i>

34:44.141 --> 34:45.882
To high. It is too high for you.

34:47.697 --> 34:49.954
-Wrong key.
<i>-Something to</i>

34:53.377 --> 34:57.239
<i>-Did you find yourself...</i>
-Just make up shit. That is right.

34:58.935 --> 35:02.911
Why did I do it?

35:03.408 --> 35:04.392
It is too high, man.

35:04.559 --> 35:07.088
-Too high.
<i>-You may find</i>

35:07.852 --> 35:12.405
<i>that the world may be cruel
motherfucker.</i>

35:13.397 --> 35:14.247
Father?

35:15.058 --> 35:15.908
Father?

35:17.412 --> 35:21.662
<i>This end is down</i>

35:22.540 --> 35:24.499
<i>A fool</i>

35:26.273 --> 35:27.749
-Shit.
-Bravo!

35:28.090 --> 35:29.263
Bravisemo!

35:29.650 --> 35:31.540
It is beautiful,
I can't wait until the concert.

35:31.842 --> 35:32.692
Yeah, right.

35:33.024 --> 35:33.935
Look, I'm out.

35:34.393 --> 35:35.634
You need anything? You eat?

35:36.310 --> 35:37.160
Yeah.

35:37.849 --> 35:40.018
We'll see you.
If you need anything, beep me.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.751
-Roemello.
-What?

35:48.774 --> 35:50.997
You know,
when I got back from the hospital.

35:51.616 --> 35:53.959
You know after Sal
and those fuckers tore me up.

35:56.792 --> 35:58.182
You know what I did to those guys?

36:03.737 --> 36:04.613
Nothing.

36:12.025 --> 36:13.763
So you got no choice.

36:15.723 --> 36:17.639
You got to take care of Lolly.

36:20.076 --> 36:21.045
Because if you don't...

36:23.109 --> 36:24.780
...you know how you are going to wind up.

36:30.315 --> 36:31.371
You're looking at it.

36:35.118 --> 36:36.763
OK, Tony. Good night.

36:37.782 --> 36:39.125
Tell Lolly to call me.

36:39.614 --> 36:40.610
OK. Good night, Gus.

36:50.006 --> 36:52.086
Hey, Rick, man, how long
we been knowing one another?

36:54.048 --> 36:56.896
I think about 15 years.

36:58.063 --> 36:58.913
Eighteen.

36:59.090 --> 37:01.010
-Fifteen.
-Eighteen.

37:01.177 --> 37:04.530
Fifteen, I knew you
when you doodle in your pants.

37:04.703 --> 37:07.730
Fifteen years ago,
we didn't have nothing.

37:08.792 --> 37:10.059
But we was happy.

37:10.730 --> 37:14.105
I still do not have nothing
and I ain't too happy about that.

37:14.916 --> 37:16.276
Oh, man, come on.

37:16.952 --> 37:19.356
You got two beautiful kids,
beautiful wife.

37:19.830 --> 37:20.680
Nice car.

37:21.328 --> 37:22.575
Hell, you are a rich man.

37:23.089 --> 37:25.280
Well, you could have had that too, see.

37:25.876 --> 37:27.382
But you moved too fast.

37:28.172 --> 37:30.834
Well, I have to admit,
I am trying to slow down, man.

37:30.924 --> 37:31.828
I am really trying.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.681
Let me ask you something.
What would you do...

37:40.556 --> 37:42.056
...if I went away?

37:42.889 --> 37:43.847
Went away where, man?

37:43.937 --> 37:46.970
I do not know, I mean,
if I just kind of disappeared you know.

37:48.729 --> 37:51.779
Well, I would find the motherfucker
and take care of him.

37:53.610 --> 37:55.785
I appreciate that, homes,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

37:55.875 --> 37:57.220
Wait, go away where?

37:57.405 --> 37:59.925
You going somewhere tonight, Roeme?
What is up? Talk to me, man?

38:03.072 --> 38:03.922
No.

38:05.029 --> 38:07.967
Just tonight watch my back. All right?

38:08.461 --> 38:09.311
Still Lolly?

38:12.536 --> 38:14.876
Well, I haven't taken my eyes off of him.

38:16.841 --> 38:17.887
All four of them.

38:21.599 --> 38:22.602
By the way...

38:26.184 --> 38:27.068
Checkmate.

38:28.819 --> 38:31.157
Oh, yeah! Come on, come on a little
closer. Take a look at that there!

38:31.247 --> 38:33.513
Check Mate! Pow!

38:34.233 --> 38:35.481
Now. About Sunday.

38:36.033 --> 38:38.491
Don't fuck up like you did
on that chess board all right?

38:38.581 --> 38:39.765
Look, do not worry about it.
I am not going to fuck up.

38:39.855 --> 38:41.130
I know about the baptism.

38:42.335 --> 38:45.151
You decided on what you are going to name
that little rug rat of yours.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.540
Well, since we been friends for so long...

38:51.416 --> 38:53.202
...definitely not Roemello.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.263
-In a minute boy!
-Yeah, get out of here.

39:06.680 --> 39:10.183
Melissa, what's wrong with you?
You high or something?

39:10.904 --> 39:11.930
High or I'm in love?

39:12.490 --> 39:14.794
I am happy! I'm happy happy happy.

39:14.977 --> 39:15.827
About what?

39:17.187 --> 39:18.530
Got a part on something?

39:18.901 --> 39:19.751
Maybe.

39:20.528 --> 39:21.528
You never know.

39:21.741 --> 39:23.487
Could be my first leading role.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.828
Don't make me guess.

39:25.817 --> 39:27.698
Oh, come on, mama, mama, mama.

39:27.788 --> 39:29.971
-Come on.
-I don't want you to get hurt.

39:30.071 --> 39:32.415
I just want you to get serious
about your life

39:32.505 --> 39:36.212
and stop wasting time
on chasing this illusion.

39:36.571 --> 39:38.377
Anything for you, mama.

39:40.289 --> 39:41.139
Anything.

39:43.041 --> 39:46.051
<i>-Roemello and Melissa sitting</i>
-What did you say?

39:46.141 --> 39:49.469
I didn't say anything, mama.
Just playing with the thing.

39:55.732 --> 39:59.073
-Do you know what I would love to do?
-No.

39:59.403 --> 40:02.565
I would love to just go to the airport
and hop on the first plane,

40:02.656 --> 40:03.709
going anywhere.

40:05.492 --> 40:06.664
Any place will do, you know.

40:07.359 --> 40:08.360
-Is that right?
-That is right.

40:08.450 --> 40:10.704
I just fly away
and leave all this shit behind.

40:10.794 --> 40:12.204
And you would not take me with you?

40:12.562 --> 40:16.192
Well, we are dreaming, right?
You said if I could do...

40:17.850 --> 40:19.137
Yes, I'd take you with me.

40:20.192 --> 40:21.371
Now is that not something.

40:23.097 --> 40:25.023
-Any place will do.
-Oh, yeah?

40:28.230 --> 40:29.276
Don't you ever dream?

40:30.819 --> 40:32.424
Yeah, I dream.

40:33.525 --> 40:35.052
My dreams always kind of evil.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.370
You know what?

40:40.325 --> 40:41.729
I think I would like to get on that plane.

40:41.819 --> 40:43.437
-Matter of fact, I just buy the plane.
-OK.

40:43.527 --> 40:44.400
Put a kick on it.

40:44.534 --> 40:45.281
-You know what I'm saying?
-A kick?

40:45.371 --> 40:46.835
Kick my plane out. Yeah.

40:46.960 --> 40:47.992
-Pimp it.
-Yeah.

40:48.573 --> 40:50.949
I'd like to go back to see
where my parents came from.

40:52.372 --> 40:53.326
That's a good dream.

40:54.468 --> 40:55.368
I would like that.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.691
Fuck you, Ginny man!

41:04.791 --> 41:05.776
Hey, Lolly, give me my glasses

41:05.866 --> 41:07.792
so I can see this little Italian,
motherfucker!

41:07.882 --> 41:08.939
Come on motherfucker!

41:09.061 --> 41:10.308
Come on, you got commode!

41:13.518 --> 41:16.606
-What the fuck is this really about?
-Batter up!

41:21.937 --> 41:23.907
Why don't you tell me
why you are so cozy with me?

41:24.074 --> 41:25.151
What's Roemello doing?

41:25.401 --> 41:26.952
Because you just showed up, man.

41:27.813 --> 41:28.663
I told you.

41:29.085 --> 41:30.888
We don't know you.

41:30.978 --> 41:32.788
Oh, you want to get to know me?

41:33.163 --> 41:34.039
Oh, OK.

41:34.129 --> 41:36.855
Well, I am a man of my word.

41:38.478 --> 41:40.079
You want to walk out of here like a man?

41:41.242 --> 41:43.455
Why won't you just tell me
what the fuck is going on?

41:43.545 --> 41:44.875
What does Roemello want from me?

41:46.007 --> 41:47.007
Am I in danger?

41:49.722 --> 41:50.572
Yeah.

41:51.318 --> 41:52.168
After this.

41:55.150 --> 41:56.016
Clean him up!

41:56.873 --> 41:57.873
Let's freshen him up?

41:58.652 --> 41:59.586
You all right?

42:01.595 --> 42:03.154
-Shower.
-Are you all right?

42:04.686 --> 42:05.536
I'm fine.

42:07.727 --> 42:10.287
This is really good stuff.

42:11.293 --> 42:12.830
You are going to love it kid.

42:14.462 --> 42:16.459
I will see you soon, Lolly!

42:16.774 --> 42:17.873
Motherfucker!

42:20.118 --> 42:22.164
Like I said, I'm a man of my word.

42:23.796 --> 42:24.796
Do you want to smoke?

42:36.845 --> 42:37.978
Just listen to that trumpet.

42:44.107 --> 42:45.931
How come you know so much about music?

42:46.923 --> 42:50.540
Well, my father was a musician.

42:51.997 --> 42:54.016
And I inherited
all the record collection from him.

42:58.953 --> 43:00.669
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

43:04.235 --> 43:05.504
How old were you when he died?

43:08.803 --> 43:09.681
Oh, God.

43:11.754 --> 43:13.356
When I was 11 years old...

43:14.680 --> 43:17.651
...my mother and my father and I
went to Resse Park one Sunday.

43:18.933 --> 43:20.884
My father went
to go get a pack of cigarettes

43:20.974 --> 43:24.573
and that was the last time
we ever saw him.

43:26.658 --> 43:28.912
In a way,
I guess it's kind of like he died to.

43:30.281 --> 43:32.537
Except he didn't leave me anything
to remember him by.

43:50.686 --> 43:52.016
Can you tell me what's going on?

43:52.132 --> 43:53.629
Can not tell you right now.
I will not be long.

43:53.719 --> 43:55.009
Just take the car
and drive home, all right?

43:55.099 --> 43:56.093
Why? Where you going?

43:56.218 --> 43:57.459
Look, I'll come by there later on,
all right?

43:57.549 --> 43:58.930
Just take the car and drive home.

43:59.138 --> 44:00.674
-Go! Now!
-Wait a minute!

44:00.764 --> 44:01.614
Go!

44:03.370 --> 44:04.355
What the fuck is going on?

44:04.445 --> 44:05.819
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your shit,

44:05.909 --> 44:06.911
but we got trouble.

44:07.201 --> 44:10.568
-What kind of trouble?
-It's bad, Roeme. It's real bad.

44:12.625 --> 44:14.650
It has got Gus and Lolly
written all over it.

44:34.635 --> 44:35.485
It is Ricky.

44:39.556 --> 44:41.149
We found him about an hour ago.

44:46.725 --> 44:47.617
Bring him down.

44:49.295 --> 44:50.295
Bring him down!

45:04.632 --> 45:05.636
What are you doing here?

45:06.678 --> 45:08.498
You don't belong here.
I told you to drive the fucking car home!

45:08.588 --> 45:10.266
I can't drive!

45:19.071 --> 45:22.264
Fuck it, man,
I ain't going out like that, Ro.

45:22.965 --> 45:26.770
I am not with that motherfucking gook
fuck punk ass pussy boy, piece of shit!

45:27.606 --> 45:29.020
This is Harlem, motherfucker!

45:29.531 --> 45:31.401
Tell me about the fucking peace
that they understand up here,

45:31.491 --> 45:33.398
it is nine motherfucking millimeter!

45:34.321 --> 45:36.836
This is the flavor
that they savor up here neighbor!

45:37.128 --> 45:38.201
Can not do it like that!

45:38.666 --> 45:40.906
Look, man, I know how you feel,
I feel the same way too!

45:41.754 --> 45:43.503
God knows, man,
we've been through some shit.

45:43.593 --> 45:44.649
And I swear to God, man,

45:44.739 --> 45:46.406
I do not want to have
to bury not one more of you.

45:46.496 --> 45:47.454
You understand that?

45:47.823 --> 45:49.162
So look trust me on this.

45:50.304 --> 45:52.685
We got to do it my way. All right?

45:52.880 --> 45:56.012
I want you to chill.
Just chill, all right? I will handle this.

46:04.773 --> 46:06.055
Hey, Roeme.

46:07.184 --> 46:08.814
It's OK, Roco, I will close up.

46:11.907 --> 46:15.702
-You want a drink?
-No. I am cool.

46:18.274 --> 46:19.416
You don't look cool.

46:26.447 --> 46:28.712
You, you look the same.

46:30.794 --> 46:31.909
I am not the same.

46:32.938 --> 46:33.788
Really?

46:37.504 --> 46:38.728
Nothing is the same.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.407
Now why is that?

47:01.081 --> 47:05.028
You know, Roeme,
I've been here almost 30 years.

47:06.587 --> 47:08.201
I never wanted to come here.

47:10.083 --> 47:13.212
But the head of the family said
there are two things you never turn down.

47:14.087 --> 47:15.216
Pussy and money.

47:17.392 --> 47:18.267
So...

47:20.179 --> 47:22.508
...they sent me and my cousin Sal up here.

47:29.241 --> 47:32.446
Back in those days, it was slow uptown.

47:35.194 --> 47:40.452
The only drug addicts were musicians
and Tommy beat-nicks.

47:48.879 --> 47:49.729
Harlem.

47:55.399 --> 47:57.965
Harlem was a beautiful place back then.

47:59.098 --> 48:02.479
Hundred and twenty fifth street
at Christmas was like 34th street.

48:03.652 --> 48:05.882
Shops, crowded streets.

48:06.763 --> 48:08.303
But after King was killed...

48:09.733 --> 48:10.972
...the people went crazy.

48:12.548 --> 48:13.721
Destroying the place.

48:15.019 --> 48:17.641
Decent colored people
could not even walk down the street.

48:22.153 --> 48:23.520
Life changed.

48:27.414 --> 48:28.480
There was a kid...

48:29.744 --> 48:31.114
There was a kid I liked.

48:33.203 --> 48:35.137
Played the piano beautifully.

48:37.418 --> 48:39.181
Smoked a little dope now and then.

48:40.831 --> 48:42.213
Knew everybody uptown.

48:43.974 --> 48:45.402
He had the strangest name.

48:46.466 --> 48:47.772
Arthur Roemello.

48:48.884 --> 48:49.852
Your father.

48:54.485 --> 48:55.768
He started to work for me.

48:57.311 --> 48:58.519
It was raining money.

48:59.075 --> 49:02.451
That's when the junkie vets
started to come back from Vietnam.

49:04.457 --> 49:06.142
Everything was good.

49:09.991 --> 49:11.832
I treated AR like family.

49:13.547 --> 49:14.877
But he got too comfortable.

49:16.191 --> 49:18.030
He started using the shit.

49:19.054 --> 49:21.927
He started telling people
that he was running things.

49:22.678 --> 49:24.682
Money got lost!

49:27.718 --> 49:30.135
That's when Sal shot him up on the roof!

49:33.435 --> 49:34.975
When Sal died...

49:41.117 --> 49:42.106
...that is when you...

49:54.836 --> 49:56.339
But I am to nice to people.

49:57.867 --> 50:00.220
And it always backfires right up the ass.

50:00.845 --> 50:01.837
Like now.

50:06.922 --> 50:08.134
So what is happening now, Gus?

50:08.224 --> 50:11.267
Don't come here pointing
your fucking finger at me, Roemello.

50:11.559 --> 50:13.229
So who do I point my fucking finger at?

50:14.486 --> 50:15.728
What did you have a bad day?

50:16.388 --> 50:18.572
Everybody has got a bad day!

50:19.284 --> 50:20.736
Lawyers, priests.

50:21.744 --> 50:23.036
Even grocers.

50:24.628 --> 50:25.478
Grocers?

50:27.070 --> 50:28.664
I don't see any grocers, Gus.

50:36.215 --> 50:38.574
I never wanted to know who killed Sal.

50:43.427 --> 50:46.832
Yeah, but I knew one day
you would tell me.

50:50.384 --> 50:53.621
Tell you what? That I'm finished.

51:16.954 --> 51:19.020
Goggles sent you over here to scout, huh?

51:19.547 --> 51:21.019
Make sure the coast is clear.

51:23.634 --> 51:24.873
That coward.

51:25.645 --> 51:27.623
-No. No, no, no.
-What "no, no, no?"

51:27.713 --> 51:29.177
Like I do not know my old man.

51:29.389 --> 51:30.884
Oh, come on he is not that bad.

51:31.574 --> 51:35.937
I mean, he has done some crazy things
but he was in there when he married you.

51:36.726 --> 51:37.872
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

51:37.972 --> 51:38.727
That is true.

51:38.827 --> 51:40.173
Are we talking about the same guy
who threw up

51:40.273 --> 51:41.883
on the very first suit I ever bought.

51:43.109 --> 51:44.265
Same night he met you.

51:44.863 --> 51:47.601
I mean, I do not know
if that is good or bad, you know?

51:49.612 --> 51:52.790
Out of all the people I know,
he was the sweetest.

52:04.045 --> 52:06.341
Ricky Jr, come on, let us go to your room.

52:10.182 --> 52:11.032
Now.

52:12.295 --> 52:13.800
-Goodnight Uncle.
-All right, man.

52:19.019 --> 52:20.526
Talk to you later. All right.

52:22.700 --> 52:24.513
-Go look at TV in there, OK?
-OK.

52:25.318 --> 52:28.021
<i>Why</i>

52:29.011 --> 52:32.442
<i>Should I feel</i>

52:34.032 --> 52:39.040
<i>Discouraged</i>

52:42.535 --> 52:44.386
<i>Tell me why</i>

52:46.602 --> 52:51.650
<i>Should the shadows</i>

52:52.204 --> 52:54.523
<i>Shadows fall?</i>

52:57.892 --> 53:04.653
<i>And why, should my heart</i>

53:05.185 --> 53:07.737
<i>Feel lonely,</i>

53:09.449 --> 53:12.753
<i>And long</i>

53:13.315 --> 53:18.034
<i>For heaven, heavenly home</i>

53:22.595 --> 53:25.159
How come, man? I don't get it.

53:26.844 --> 53:28.462
First, you talk about
how your booking and handing

53:28.552 --> 53:29.659
this shit over to me, man.

53:29.749 --> 53:31.512
And now you are talking
this your way shit.

53:32.058 --> 53:33.041
What is up with that?

53:33.644 --> 53:34.972
Yeah, what is up with that, Ray?

53:36.128 --> 53:38.676
Look, why not you, me and Daddy
just get the hell out of here?

53:39.883 --> 53:41.448
You do not have to deal with that shit?

53:41.923 --> 53:44.972
I told you, man,
I am not hearing that leaving shit, Roeme.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.557
I just ain't hearing that shit. Damn!

53:50.956 --> 53:51.806
Damn!

54:04.284 --> 54:05.383
I want to make a toast.

54:14.767 --> 54:15.617
Two toasts.

54:18.013 --> 54:19.390
One to my man, Goggles.

54:21.044 --> 54:22.392
Who is no longer with us.

54:24.161 --> 54:25.232
And the other one...

54:27.436 --> 54:29.031
And the other one to my brother...

54:31.233 --> 54:32.284
...Roemello.

54:33.561 --> 54:35.788
Who will be leaving us shortly.

54:39.081 --> 54:40.867
For God knows where the fuck or what!

54:45.000 --> 54:47.204
To go on back home and shit!

54:48.383 --> 54:49.657
Wherever the fuck! That is!

54:50.838 --> 54:53.806
Swamp fox South Carolina.
Some shit like that!

54:55.925 --> 54:59.464
Maybe we just be going to buy
the master's house.

55:00.538 --> 55:01.929
Sit around on the porch.

55:02.138 --> 55:03.272
Drink mint Julep.

55:04.025 --> 55:05.491
Watch the sun go down.

55:06.761 --> 55:08.639
Pretend we are white folks.

55:10.440 --> 55:11.825
You are playing yourself, Ray.

55:11.992 --> 55:13.825
No, you are playing yourself, Rome!

55:14.344 --> 55:17.387
Because it doesn't matter where you go,
what you do, or what you know,

55:17.477 --> 55:18.564
you're still a nigger!

55:47.477 --> 55:49.649
Leon, frisk him.

56:04.087 --> 56:07.951
This was the fight when I said,
Fuck it, life is way too short.

56:09.119 --> 56:12.088
He dropped me with a left cross,
first minute of the third round.

56:12.843 --> 56:13.843
When I woke up...

56:16.168 --> 56:17.367
...I was a rich man.

56:19.436 --> 56:21.810
Yeah, I saw that fight.

56:23.126 --> 56:24.376
I put all my money on you.

56:25.389 --> 56:26.323
Is that right?

56:26.591 --> 56:27.441
Look, Lolly.

56:28.397 --> 56:31.258
Yesterday, I buried my best friend.

56:32.235 --> 56:33.085
Best friend.

56:34.028 --> 56:36.317
Eighteen years we go back,
slanging and banging.

56:36.609 --> 56:38.566
And now, that has all gone up in smoke.

56:39.316 --> 56:41.345
The other day there was a shoot out
at the Dunbar.

56:41.744 --> 56:44.834
A bunch of clank ass YG's
with uzi's sprayed the place.

56:47.004 --> 56:47.937
Come on, Lolly.

56:48.968 --> 56:49.968
Look at Harlem.

56:51.420 --> 56:53.790
It seems like somebody is always dying
before their time.

56:57.491 --> 56:59.011
There is not going to be a war, Lolly.

56:59.839 --> 57:01.052
I do not want anymore killing.

57:03.962 --> 57:07.220
You got some fucking balls.
You come in here all alone.

57:08.088 --> 57:10.098
Talking about what you do not want?

57:15.892 --> 57:17.025
You see, Roemello.

57:19.403 --> 57:23.620
Men like you got a lot of ideas about...

57:24.905 --> 57:27.230
...what you want, what you do not want.

57:28.193 --> 57:29.043
Care about.

57:29.692 --> 57:30.892
Do not care about.

57:31.699 --> 57:32.765
But machines...

57:35.294 --> 57:37.759
Sometimes machines have a mind
of their own.

57:38.742 --> 57:39.675
Is that right?

57:43.178 --> 57:44.678
Now you being real extra.

57:48.054 --> 57:51.025
Look, champ, you want to start this?
Fine with me.

57:51.615 --> 57:53.655
But first, I think you better look out
that window.

57:56.613 --> 57:58.252
You see the guy reading the comic book?

58:01.060 --> 58:02.946
And the one on the heavy bag? You see him?

58:06.027 --> 58:07.374
How about the one with the hood.

58:08.243 --> 58:09.108
There you see him?

58:25.334 --> 58:28.849
Look, Lolly.
I think we need to call a truce.

58:31.856 --> 58:32.986
You do not hit my men.

58:33.592 --> 58:34.603
I will not hit your men.

58:35.767 --> 58:37.013
You do not hurt my brother.

58:37.891 --> 58:39.689
And I will not take your whole family.

58:41.137 --> 58:43.449
We will work it out
so you can get a piece of the action.

58:45.112 --> 58:46.113
OK, chump? I mean...

58:47.686 --> 58:48.536
...Champ.

58:52.071 --> 58:53.137
My word is bond.

59:05.847 --> 59:08.235
Melissa. Melissa, wait.

59:08.601 --> 59:10.946
Oh God, shit. Wait a minute.

59:12.092 --> 59:12.942
Melissa!

59:16.366 --> 59:18.353
Melissa, listen to me.
I know you do not want to see me,

59:18.443 --> 59:19.955
-but at least got to hear me out.
-Well, you are right.

59:20.045 --> 59:22.251
I do not want to see you
so do not make no fool of yourself.

59:22.341 --> 59:23.806
I do not care if I make a fool
out of myself.

59:23.896 --> 59:24.898
Oh, that is obvious.

59:26.134 --> 59:27.692
Let me tell you something, Roemello.

59:28.044 --> 59:31.169
Your shit is extra.
I saw that the other night.

59:31.259 --> 59:32.726
You are a dope dealer.

59:35.842 --> 59:37.870
Look, Melissa.
You think I do not know who I am?

59:38.037 --> 59:38.926
I know what I do.

59:39.093 --> 59:40.830
How can you live with that, Roemello?

59:44.626 --> 59:46.076
I am afraid of you.

59:46.166 --> 59:49.496
Look, Melissa. I am sorry.
I am sorry, all right?

59:49.586 --> 59:51.465
Whatever you saw last night,
I am sorry about it.

59:51.555 --> 59:52.769
But you saw something else.

59:52.978 --> 59:55.928
Something happened between you and me.
And I can't stop thinking about it.

59:56.018 --> 59:57.845
I do not even know you, boy.
Are you crazy?

59:57.935 --> 59:59.434
I know you do not know who I am
and you are right!

59:59.524 --> 01:00:00.809
You might not even like who I am.

01:00:00.899 --> 01:00:04.020
But, Melissa, you got to believe me.
Everything in my life is about to change.

01:00:09.283 --> 01:00:10.899
I swear on my mother's grave.

01:00:11.413 --> 01:00:12.547
Give me a chance.

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:17.777
What do you want from me, Roemello?

01:00:18.003 --> 01:00:19.411
What... please.

01:00:19.662 --> 01:00:21.737
You can have anybody
that you want out here.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:24.243
-Why are you bothering me?
-I want to talk to you.

01:00:24.578 --> 01:00:26.744
I want you to get to know me.
I want to get to know you.

01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:28.825
Why the fuck are we standing here
with a gate between us?

01:00:28.915 --> 01:00:29.781
Come outside.

01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:33.258
Look, just leave me alone, OK?

01:00:33.348 --> 01:00:36.055
-Look, I just want to talk to you.
-Why are you bothering me?

01:00:36.145 --> 01:00:37.875
-Because you are the one that is why.
-Leave me alone!

01:00:37.965 --> 01:00:39.918
-You are the one.
-No. Leave me alone!

01:00:40.223 --> 01:00:42.178
We sit and we talk. We go to my house
and we sit and we talk.

01:00:42.268 --> 01:00:43.118
Your house!

01:00:46.823 --> 01:00:48.366
So that is what this is all about?

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.279
-What you talking about?
-Come on! Let us go!

01:00:52.885 --> 01:00:55.652
You are going to all of this trouble
because you want me to go to your house.

01:00:55.742 --> 01:00:56.609
Well, come on!

01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:58.115
-What are you talking about?
-Come on!

01:00:58.205 --> 01:00:59.527
-You think I do this all the time.
-Yes!

01:00:59.617 --> 01:01:00.467
I do not!

01:01:00.622 --> 01:01:02.581
I do not ask girls out. Girls ask me out!

01:01:02.748 --> 01:01:05.193
Melissa, I can not even remember
the last time I even did this.

01:01:05.283 --> 01:01:07.473
I do not even know
the motherfucker that is doing it!

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:11.383
All I want to do is to go out with you.

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:13.710
That is it. I just want to take a walk.

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.410
I want to go to the movies.

01:01:15.535 --> 01:01:16.923
I want to go to amateur night
at the Apollo.

01:01:17.013 --> 01:01:19.034
Boo people! Do shit that normal people do.

01:01:27.188 --> 01:01:28.038
Look.

01:01:28.809 --> 01:01:32.384
Do not answer me now, all right?
Just go upstairs and think about it.

01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:35.873
Will you do that for me.
Just think about it.

01:01:36.122 --> 01:01:37.273
You got to give me a chance.

01:01:39.202 --> 01:01:41.329
And then I will call you.
If you will let me call you.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.369
Can I call you?

01:01:59.185 --> 01:02:01.839
OK. I will think about it.

01:03:16.094 --> 01:03:18.594
Hey, look, man.
I know you did not want to do this.

01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:21.104
Just do it for me as a favor, all right?

01:03:22.554 --> 01:03:23.404
Go.

01:03:24.276 --> 01:03:26.291
All right. Food is ready.

01:03:27.611 --> 01:03:28.600
You all right?

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:31.089
Let's go.

01:03:38.011 --> 01:03:39.212
Put this down right there.

01:03:41.352 --> 01:03:43.645
Do not put your hands there.
OK, put your hands there.

01:03:47.462 --> 01:03:49.001
Now, we give thanks.

01:03:49.919 --> 01:03:53.281
Thank you, Mr Chicken God,
for all that you have given us

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:56.286
chicken backs, chicken butts,
and chicken thighs.

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:57.915
Thank you, Mr Kentucky.

01:03:58.123 --> 01:03:59.854
Without you, we would have no food.

01:04:00.146 --> 01:04:02.101
OK. Now we can eat.

01:04:09.866 --> 01:04:10.922
It has been a long time
since we all sat down and...

01:04:11.022 --> 01:04:12.927
Since we been up in this fucking dump.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:17.600
Just eat up, Ray.

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:28.740
How was school today, fellas?

01:04:32.005 --> 01:04:34.585
That is funny. That is funny.

01:04:45.932 --> 01:04:47.812
-Hey, man, you all right?
-Yeah, I am all right.

01:04:48.345 --> 01:04:49.195
Sure?

01:04:50.525 --> 01:04:52.147
I am just feeling a little sick,
that is all.

01:04:52.237 --> 01:04:55.397
So why do you not just do us all
a damn favor and die.

01:04:58.211 --> 01:04:59.084
Ray,

01:04:59.782 --> 01:05:01.942
Why don't you sit down,
your food is getting cold, man.

01:05:02.318 --> 01:05:04.916
All right.
Show a little respect for your father.

01:05:05.156 --> 01:05:07.509
-My what?
-Our father.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.837
This nigger ain't my pops, man.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:14.316
This motherfucker gave up the right
to call himself that

01:05:14.406 --> 01:05:16.068
a long motherfucking time ago.

01:05:16.158 --> 01:05:18.206
-And who gave you the right to decide?
-Me!

01:05:18.303 --> 01:05:20.355
-Are you kidding?
-You know when I decided?

01:05:21.268 --> 01:05:23.549
When he put our motherfucking lives
on the line!

01:05:24.794 --> 01:05:27.104
When he made our mom a god damn junkie!

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:29.460
You think you know what it's like?

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:32.528
No, but you do! You knew, Pop!

01:05:37.469 --> 01:05:38.479
You knew it, man.

01:05:42.912 --> 01:05:44.593
You knew she was slamming dope.

01:05:47.903 --> 01:05:49.272
You did not do nothing about it.

01:05:51.835 --> 01:05:53.003
You could have stopped her.

01:05:56.003 --> 01:05:57.382
You haven't stopped me, Ray.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:00.264
Now, have you?

01:06:16.436 --> 01:06:17.286
Hey, Roeme.

01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:23.254
I was just trying to make her happy.

01:06:26.359 --> 01:06:28.362
I swear to God
I was just trying to keep her alive.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:31.225
You know I thought,

01:06:32.594 --> 01:06:34.746
maybe I might find a way
to get her off the shit.

01:06:36.074 --> 01:06:36.941
To help her.

01:06:41.922 --> 01:06:45.179
You thought you would help her.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:49.472
You were just making her happy, Dad?

01:06:51.926 --> 01:06:53.799
This was how you were making her happy?

01:06:56.982 --> 01:06:58.738
You God damn son of a bitch.

01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:01.309
You fucking killed her.

01:07:01.854 --> 01:07:03.587
What do you want me to do?

01:07:06.129 --> 01:07:08.263
You want me to kill myself, Ray?

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:13.945
I am already dead.

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:21.331
I am out of here. Fuck this shit.

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:23.671
-Ray.
-Fuck it!

01:07:23.761 --> 01:07:24.611
Ray.

01:07:32.759 --> 01:07:33.609
Roeme.

01:07:37.516 --> 01:07:38.684
You may go with your brother.

01:07:42.207 --> 01:07:43.365
Please, man.

01:07:47.395 --> 01:07:48.654
You all are breaking my heart.

01:08:00.278 --> 01:08:02.729
-Come on, baby, dance for me.
-Whatever you say.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.658
Let me see. Turn around. That a girl.

01:08:06.729 --> 01:08:07.795
Come here, baby.

01:08:08.892 --> 01:08:11.269
You will never be the same after tonight.

01:08:13.978 --> 01:08:15.435
Party is over motherfucker!

01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:18.384
We are with the Health Department,
I heard you was a damn rat!

01:08:18.474 --> 01:08:19.437
Get him! Grab his ass!

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.725
-You grab my boy...
-Fuck him up!

01:08:22.814 --> 01:08:24.606
-You grab my boy...
-Stop!

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:31.705
Get him up! Come on! Get up!

01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:35.451
Get off me! Get off me!

01:08:35.916 --> 01:08:37.698
-Get your hands off me!
-Shut up, you rat!

01:08:41.453 --> 01:08:42.304
Bitch!

01:08:42.975 --> 01:08:43.825
Yeah, yeah!

01:08:44.005 --> 01:08:46.345
-Get off of me, God damn it!
-I'll kill you!

01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:48.962
-Hey, get off me!
-I will blow your motherfucking ass away!

01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:50.198
You hear me?

01:08:57.279 --> 01:09:01.179
<i>Looking back over the years
I guess I shed us some tears</i>

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.934
<i>I told myself time and time again
This time you are going to win</i>

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:08.727
<i>But another fight
When things are not right</i>

01:09:08.948 --> 01:09:10.148
<i>I am losing again</i>

01:09:10.886 --> 01:09:15.233
<i>It takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again</i>

01:09:16.154 --> 01:09:17.801
<i>I think I better let it go</i>

01:09:19.326 --> 01:09:21.947
<i>Looks like another love TKO</i>

01:09:25.999 --> 01:09:28.759
<i>Looks like another love TKO</i>

01:09:29.514 --> 01:09:31.379
Oh, hey, cuco man.

01:09:31.636 --> 01:09:34.443
What the fuck, man, what is the matter?
I thought you was a tough guy, then.

01:09:34.533 --> 01:09:35.455
Oh, you motherfuckers!

01:09:35.545 --> 01:09:38.621
You do not look so fucking tough
standing up there now, right?

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.975
You do not look so fucking tough

01:09:40.064 --> 01:09:42.345
with a couple of mooleys
standing over you now, do you?

01:09:44.599 --> 01:09:46.050
I thought you told me
you relaxed this fucker.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.291
Hey, I did, man.

01:09:47.943 --> 01:09:49.975
I think he needs
a couple more sleeping pills.

01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:56.242
Son of a bitch motherfucker.
Fuck the man like that!

01:09:57.545 --> 01:09:58.395
Hey, Ray.

01:09:59.092 --> 01:10:01.065
I am going to give him something
to help wash it down.

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.975
Yeah. He do look
a little fucking thirsty to me.

01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:13.723
<i>Taking the bumps and the bruises
And all the pain</i>

01:10:14.078 --> 01:10:15.965
<i>Of a two time loser</i>

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:17.977
<i>Trying to hold on</i>

01:10:28.571 --> 01:10:29.455
What is up, Roeme?

01:10:31.788 --> 01:10:32.638
Where is he?

01:10:34.061 --> 01:10:35.296
Over there getting pissed off.

01:10:35.819 --> 01:10:37.488
Probably kicking himself in the ass
for not coping

01:10:37.578 --> 01:10:39.785
that life insurance policy
like he should have.

01:10:45.203 --> 01:10:46.920
-This isn't what I wanted, Ray.
-What?

01:10:47.426 --> 01:10:50.410
This is the fucking Ginny motherfucker
that smoked Goggles, man!

01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:55.380
Somebody has got
to let these motherfuckers know

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:56.755
what time it is, Roeme.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:00.435
I mean, you can not go on bum
rushing up in there like that shit, man.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.595
This is about turf, boss.

01:11:04.438 --> 01:11:06.884
We all worked too long and too hard
to get this shit

01:11:06.975 --> 01:11:08.855
to let it go down the drain
like that shit.

01:11:09.652 --> 01:11:11.236
I mean, how the fuck do we look, man?

01:11:12.692 --> 01:11:15.267
-Ray, do you know what this means?
-Yeah, I know what this means.

01:11:15.957 --> 01:11:17.664
-You know what you did.
-Yeah.

01:11:18.236 --> 01:11:20.625
It means I started a motherfucking war.

01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:23.298
And your ass is straight up
in the middle of it, OK?

01:11:24.349 --> 01:11:25.297
It is a bitch!

01:11:34.043 --> 01:11:34.909
Finish him.

01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:40.094
Oh, now you want me to finish him.

01:11:42.292 --> 01:11:43.142
No, man.

01:11:44.152 --> 01:11:45.477
I saved him for you.

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:48.229
My brother, Roemello.

01:11:50.694 --> 01:11:53.373
So you can remember
what the fuck this is all about.

01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:56.035
Remember where you come from.

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:58.162
Who you are.

01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:00.573
And what the fuck you do.

01:12:03.174 --> 01:12:04.024
No.

01:12:05.577 --> 01:12:06.963
You rock his cradle, Roeme.

01:12:07.795 --> 01:12:08.714
Because I am done.

01:12:09.717 --> 01:12:10.567
You.

01:12:19.783 --> 01:12:22.094
Yo. We're the fuck ghosts, man.

01:12:23.454 --> 01:12:24.304
Easy.

01:12:38.659 --> 01:12:39.866
I'm not like my brother.

01:12:55.924 --> 01:12:58.743
Now, Counselor, see, I made it very clear
that I was coming over here.

01:12:59.549 --> 01:13:03.253
I left you very specific instructions
to handle all of the legal requirements.

01:13:04.685 --> 01:13:06.733
And you do not seem
to be listening to me, Oliver.

01:13:07.214 --> 01:13:08.183
Now, I call you.

01:13:08.695 --> 01:13:10.304
You do not return my phone calls.

01:13:10.782 --> 01:13:13.189
All this makes me think
that you are trying to fuck with me.

01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:16.079
Look.

01:13:18.107 --> 01:13:19.817
Do not come in here with an attitude.

01:13:20.734 --> 01:13:22.069
Because I have been going
out of my way

01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:24.798
to make this shit you do look legit
and work for both of us.

01:13:27.233 --> 01:13:29.079
-Both of us.
-Sure.

01:13:29.788 --> 01:13:32.145
You think it is easy to hide
all that dope money you make?

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:34.566
You think it is simple
to talk a decent banker

01:13:34.656 --> 01:13:38.346
into believing this is a real business
you guys are in to?

01:13:39.041 --> 01:13:40.514
No. That is hard work.

01:13:40.847 --> 01:13:42.998
For you to come in here now
accusing me of shit.

01:13:45.382 --> 01:13:49.798
Man, I work, and you, you sell dope.

01:13:52.054 --> 01:13:53.980
I mean, if anyone is fucking
with anyone here...

01:13:55.822 --> 01:13:58.267
How about making the fucking winner
of the wet T-Shirt contest.

01:13:58.357 --> 01:14:00.491
Huh, motherfucker? Motherfucker!

01:14:02.864 --> 01:14:04.270
You handle my shit, Counselor.

01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.449
Our boy, Roemello, is out of control.
He has got to be stopped.

01:14:50.539 --> 01:14:51.405
I understand.

01:14:52.253 --> 01:14:55.506
I will handle Roemello, OK?
I will handle it.

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:57.869
You ain't handling it.

01:14:58.051 --> 01:14:59.509
He is out of fucking control,

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.515
could somebody tell me
why we're kissing this boy's ass?

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:12.356
Holy shit!

01:15:18.807 --> 01:15:20.691
Roemello! Watch out!

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:33.694
Find out who it was!

01:15:36.177 --> 01:15:37.959
Take it easy.
Just hang in there, all right?

01:15:38.548 --> 01:15:40.961
-Hang in there, man, it ain't that bad.
-How am I doing man?

01:15:41.051 --> 01:15:42.870
You are all right.
You are all right, brother?

01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:47.483
-You were lucky I was there for you, man.
-Yeah, man, I was.

01:15:47.814 --> 01:15:49.095
Yeah, man, I was lucky.

01:15:51.386 --> 01:15:53.634
Do not move, don't... Just stay calm, man,
everything is all right,

01:15:53.724 --> 01:15:54.772
You ain't that bad.

01:15:58.066 --> 01:15:59.688
I was there for you, Roeme.

01:16:01.938 --> 01:16:03.035
I was there for you.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.578
Hang in there, brother. Hang in there.
Kymie!

01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:51.080
-Hello?
<i>-Hello, Melissa.</i>

01:16:52.023 --> 01:16:54.582
Look, I will be there
soon as I can, all right?

01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:57.591
All right, you want me to bring anything?

01:16:59.319 --> 01:17:00.832
OK. Yeah.

01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:02.405
I think so.

01:17:09.384 --> 01:17:10.299
You look beautiful.

01:17:10.851 --> 01:17:12.298
You don't look too bad yourself.

01:17:12.947 --> 01:17:13.797
Thanks.

01:17:14.837 --> 01:17:16.634
-You can have a seat right here.
-All right.

01:17:17.604 --> 01:17:18.989
We got reservations now, right?

01:17:19.226 --> 01:17:21.402
Yeah, we sure do,
I just gotta get my Jacket.

01:17:31.495 --> 01:17:34.815
-Ready?
-Look, I want to ask you something.

01:17:38.912 --> 01:17:40.952
You know what happened
on Convent Avenue tonight?

01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:45.049
What do you mean what happened?

01:17:45.549 --> 01:17:49.129
A little kid got killed, were you there?

01:18:01.548 --> 01:18:04.988
Yes. I was there.

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:21.608
Do you know that...

01:18:24.722 --> 01:18:27.089
...every time I go out with you,
somebody dies?

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:32.591
I like you and I like being with you.

01:18:33.256 --> 01:18:34.729
But can you promise me...

01:18:35.349 --> 01:18:38.822
...that when I step out that door,
I am not going to be the next one?

01:18:44.748 --> 01:18:45.598
Can you?

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.567
Would you please just...

01:18:57.906 --> 01:18:59.788
I am never going to let
anything happen to you.

01:19:06.097 --> 01:19:07.961
Come on, Melissa,
you know what time it is.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.338
Yes. Somebody tried to kill me today.

01:19:13.711 --> 01:19:16.501
But, baby, they are going to keep trying
to kill me until I get out.

01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:18.848
Melissa, this was my life.

01:19:21.397 --> 01:19:24.822
What, would you think
I can just turn my back

01:19:24.922 --> 01:19:26.146
and just walk away?

01:19:27.151 --> 01:19:28.527
No, no.

01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:31.946
They're not going to let me out that easy.

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.648
The same dead zombie motherfuckers
that snatched the kid

01:19:39.738 --> 01:19:41.409
are the same ones
that are trying to drag me

01:19:41.499 --> 01:19:42.589
in the grave with them.

01:19:48.255 --> 01:19:49.268
It's not me anymore.

01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:56.553
I have tried
to put all the stuff that you do

01:19:56.643 --> 01:19:57.788
out of my mind.

01:20:00.444 --> 01:20:01.641
I tried to believe you.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.353
But you can't even believe in yourself.

01:20:11.639 --> 01:20:15.214
-Would you do me a favor?
-Anything.

01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:22.580
Please leave.

01:20:27.115 --> 01:20:29.245
No, just go.

01:20:51.274 --> 01:20:53.706
If you care about me, Roemello,
you will go.

01:21:31.096 --> 01:21:32.677
I am scared, man, OK?

01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:35.147
I am fucking scared.

01:21:36.529 --> 01:21:37.519
I mean, when you...

01:21:40.064 --> 01:21:42.683
...when you started talking that shit,
man, about how you was leaving, man,

01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:44.157
I didn't want to believe you.

01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:48.072
I am thinking...

01:21:50.696 --> 01:21:52.400
I just know
you are going to leave me, man,

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:54.333
and I just can not deal with that, Roeme.

01:21:54.423 --> 01:21:55.665
I can not deal with it.

01:22:03.011 --> 01:22:03.877
Look, Ray...

01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:06.746
...you remember one time
we went to this girls dust party

01:22:06.836 --> 01:22:08.045
up in the polo grounds?

01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:12.805
They was passing around trade bags
of red devil dust like the shit was water.

01:22:12.938 --> 01:22:14.138
You remember that?

01:22:15.265 --> 01:22:17.340
We rolled a couple of spliffs, boom.

01:22:17.495 --> 01:22:19.563
Popped them in the cake
like they were candles.

01:22:20.874 --> 01:22:22.603
I got crazy zooted that night.

01:22:22.946 --> 01:22:23.813
Crazy zooted.

01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:25.601
You remember this?

01:22:26.666 --> 01:22:28.851
Man, I got so hot that I went out
on the terrace.

01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:30.513
Then I realized there was no terrace.

01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:34.113
Here I am 24 stories up,
legs hanging out the window...

01:22:34.698 --> 01:22:38.377
...and you come and you grab me,
and you pulled me back in.

01:22:39.627 --> 01:22:44.873
And you told me, you said,
"Roeme, it is time to go home."

01:22:48.594 --> 01:22:50.513
-You remember that?
-Yeah.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.802
I never got high after that.

01:22:54.589 --> 01:22:56.301
Not even once. Did you know that?

01:22:59.762 --> 01:23:01.818
All right,
now it is time for me to flip the script.

01:23:04.818 --> 01:23:07.531
And for me to tell you
that it is time to go home.

01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:12.558
Go.

01:23:13.039 --> 01:23:14.187
Go where, man?

01:23:14.877 --> 01:23:16.501
What the fuck am I going to do?

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:19.795
Where am I going to go?

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:23.375
What am I going to do? Be a garbage man?

01:23:23.923 --> 01:23:27.426
A short order cook,
a fucking taxi cab driver, a bank teller?

01:23:30.322 --> 01:23:32.267
I can't go nowhere, man.

01:23:34.636 --> 01:23:35.845
You are my little brother.

01:23:40.698 --> 01:23:41.765
And all my life...

01:23:43.563 --> 01:23:44.815
...I looked up to you.

01:23:47.462 --> 01:23:48.572
How do you think that feel?

01:23:59.072 --> 01:24:00.617
You was always smarter than me.

01:24:04.388 --> 01:24:05.785
Thought you looked better than me.

01:24:07.727 --> 01:24:12.584
You always said the right thing,
I always said the wrong thing.

01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:19.550
Every honey that I wanted to fuck...

01:24:21.193 --> 01:24:22.473
...they wanted to fuck you.

01:24:25.771 --> 01:24:27.062
Well, I fucked them anyway.

01:24:30.656 --> 01:24:35.240
But, I got used to having you around.

01:24:37.869 --> 01:24:41.170
I just got used
to having my better half around.

01:24:43.664 --> 01:24:44.514
Can I just...

01:24:48.724 --> 01:24:52.227
...I just do not want you to go anywhere.

01:24:57.847 --> 01:25:01.429
You got this little cutie
and you are in love.

01:25:03.977 --> 01:25:04.890
Well, that is good.

01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:10.215
I don't even have that.

01:25:15.152 --> 01:25:16.032
I mean, I never...

01:25:18.485 --> 01:25:22.629
I never loved anybody, anybody, Roeme.

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:25.190
Except you.

01:25:58.527 --> 01:25:59.377
Chill out.

01:25:59.776 --> 01:26:02.538
Mark, this is my friend
I was telling you about?

01:26:02.669 --> 01:26:05.450
Oh, yes, yes.

01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:07.532
-Mark Dobby.
-Melissa Holly.

01:26:07.622 --> 01:26:09.302
Melissa Holly. Good to meet you.

01:26:09.392 --> 01:26:11.338
-Good to meet you, too.
-Yeah. Have a seat.

01:26:14.855 --> 01:26:16.255
Excuse me, Champagne.

01:26:17.682 --> 01:26:19.732
Hey, Nigger Ray. Check it out.

01:26:21.431 --> 01:26:22.431
Here is to dry.

01:26:22.689 --> 01:26:24.518
-Here is to wet.
-Here is to dry, here is to wet.

01:26:24.608 --> 01:26:25.608
Here is to wet.

01:26:26.324 --> 01:26:27.791
Can we have some more?

01:26:28.473 --> 01:26:30.819
Hey, you two, behave yourselves.

01:26:40.344 --> 01:26:42.279
Yo, yo, yo, what is up my man.

01:26:42.369 --> 01:26:44.503
Mark the Shark Dobby!

01:26:46.003 --> 01:26:48.241
Hey, man that was dope
the way you hit that jumper at the buzzer,

01:26:48.331 --> 01:26:49.371
the other night in Boston, man,

01:26:49.461 --> 01:26:51.329
that shit was checking
like a motherfucker.

01:26:57.099 --> 01:26:58.024
What is happening?

01:26:58.584 --> 01:26:59.650
You remember me?

01:27:00.795 --> 01:27:01.849
I met you the other night.

01:27:02.805 --> 01:27:03.655
Excuse me?

01:27:04.777 --> 01:27:06.559
Roemello Skuggs, you know, my brother?

01:27:09.089 --> 01:27:10.517
I am Raynathan Skuggs.

01:27:13.318 --> 01:27:14.600
Well, this is Mark Dobby.

01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:16.107
Wait, wait, wait a moment.

01:27:16.274 --> 01:27:18.493
-I do not care the fuck who he is.
-Raynathan.

01:27:20.706 --> 01:27:23.156
-Can't you see I am with the lady here?
-Hey, Mark...

01:27:25.496 --> 01:27:28.539
...if you do not raise up
and step out of my motherfucking face,

01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:29.544
you are going to catch a bad break

01:27:29.634 --> 01:27:32.034
because I am going to rain on your ass
like white on rice.

01:27:32.141 --> 01:27:33.469
You do not want to fuck with me.

01:27:34.304 --> 01:27:35.674
Damn, my little brother.

01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.084
You ain't good enough for him, anyway.

01:27:45.601 --> 01:27:47.990
Fuck that clank ass Zeek billy ass...

01:27:52.742 --> 01:27:54.706
I am really sorry, I mean,
this is getting crazy.

01:27:55.178 --> 01:27:56.861
People are always trying to fuck me off.

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:04.351
-Let's get out of here.
-OK.

01:28:07.996 --> 01:28:09.664
I am going to wait for him outside, Dad.

01:28:39.403 --> 01:28:40.447
Hey, partner.

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.790
You happy?

01:28:44.297 --> 01:28:45.402
Look what you started.

01:28:46.003 --> 01:28:47.116
-What I started?
-Yeah.

01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:48.708
You know I talked to Lolly.

01:28:49.238 --> 01:28:51.206
I told him,
I said "stay the hell out of here."

01:28:51.779 --> 01:28:52.950
God knows if he will listen.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.337
So what does that have to do with me?

01:28:56.371 --> 01:28:57.787
What does that have to do with you?

01:28:58.386 --> 01:28:59.299
I will tell you.

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.704
You start anything,

01:29:02.545 --> 01:29:04.992
any man, dingo, staggly shit.

01:29:05.598 --> 01:29:08.384
I am not just going bust you, man.
I am going to waste you.

01:29:10.032 --> 01:29:13.956
Do not fuck with me, nigger.
Because I ain't my old man.

01:29:16.113 --> 01:29:18.612
You are right, Harry. You are not.

01:29:21.208 --> 01:29:22.251
Fuck you, man.

01:29:33.303 --> 01:29:34.153
Baby.

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.832
Stop. What are you doing... Hey?

01:29:40.179 --> 01:29:41.492
No. Wait, stop.

01:29:41.781 --> 01:29:42.918
-This is not a start?
-No.

01:29:43.008 --> 01:29:43.858
OK, OK.

01:29:45.967 --> 01:29:48.228
-What are you doing?
-It is getting a little hot in here.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.014
Hey, baby, why do you not just go
smoke another joint?

01:29:52.217 --> 01:29:53.067
One second.

01:29:55.322 --> 01:29:56.455
Come on! Come on!

01:30:46.571 --> 01:30:47.421
Stop!

01:30:51.793 --> 01:30:54.755
You having a good time, baby?
Or are you just acting?

01:30:56.925 --> 01:30:57.913
I am having fun.

01:30:59.669 --> 01:31:01.580
You know how many times
I have heard that line?

01:31:02.334 --> 01:31:03.662
I am a struggling actress.

01:31:11.176 --> 01:31:12.667
You want me to tell you what you are?

01:31:15.017 --> 01:31:19.280
You are a fucking skeezer!

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:21.066
That's what the fuck you are.

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.322
A fucking skeezer. A whore!

01:31:27.997 --> 01:31:28.878
Ain't that right?

01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:35.837
-You're not absolutely fucking right?
-Yes.

01:31:37.221 --> 01:31:39.872
I can't hear you. Yes, yes.

01:31:40.387 --> 01:31:41.237
Yeah.

01:31:41.958 --> 01:31:42.824
Hey, stop it.

01:31:43.338 --> 01:31:44.188
Stop.

01:31:50.594 --> 01:31:51.462
OK, baby.

01:31:52.308 --> 01:31:53.757
Look, I am sorry, I am sorry.

01:31:54.102 --> 01:31:54.881
-Did I hurt you?
-No.

01:31:54.971 --> 01:31:56.333
I am sorry, I am sorry, it is OK.

01:31:56.423 --> 01:31:57.359
I am sorry, baby.

01:31:57.768 --> 01:31:58.972
-You all right?
-Yes.

01:31:59.174 --> 01:32:01.307
Come here, come here, come here.

01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:03.390
-Want champagne?
-No.

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.866
You sure? OK, OK.

01:32:08.946 --> 01:32:11.285
-You OK? You OK? You OK?
-Yes.

01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:12.952
Yeah. I am sorry, I am sorry.

01:32:13.042 --> 01:32:15.323
I messed up your hair and your face.

01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:19.161
I will tell you what I am going to do.

01:32:22.138 --> 01:32:25.261
I am going to let you suck my dick.

01:32:25.799 --> 01:32:27.297
-No.
-Yes.

01:32:28.398 --> 01:32:29.685
-Please, no.
-Yes.

01:32:30.264 --> 01:32:31.114
Get down.

01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:34.012
Slow. Real slow.

01:32:34.971 --> 01:32:35.821
That is it.

01:32:36.609 --> 01:32:37.475
Right there.

01:32:38.894 --> 01:32:40.732
-No.
-Yes.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.864
Slowly. Right?

01:32:44.234 --> 01:32:45.084
Stop.

01:32:49.943 --> 01:32:51.033
You bastard!

01:32:52.492 --> 01:32:54.864
-You fuck ass!
-Skeezer! You fucking...

01:32:55.148 --> 01:32:56.952
You fucking skeezer!

01:33:31.186 --> 01:33:34.264
-Dad, I am going away.
-Where?

01:33:35.752 --> 01:33:36.665
It does not matter.

01:33:39.368 --> 01:33:41.055
I just can not stay around here anymore.

01:33:42.368 --> 01:33:43.235
I can dig it.

01:33:47.432 --> 01:33:48.705
You know, you can come with me?

01:33:50.382 --> 01:33:51.929
You know, we can start all over again.

01:33:53.138 --> 01:33:54.005
From scratch.

01:33:57.446 --> 01:33:58.367
Leave Harlem?

01:34:02.008 --> 01:34:03.208
This is me, Roeme.

01:34:04.688 --> 01:34:05.615
I am Harlem.

01:34:08.105 --> 01:34:09.199
This is where I belong.

01:34:15.414 --> 01:34:16.696
This is where Ella is.

01:34:20.068 --> 01:34:21.697
I am going to stay here and be with her.

01:34:28.783 --> 01:34:32.381
Well, just think about it, OK?

01:34:35.513 --> 01:34:36.751
What about Raynathan?

01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:43.128
What happened to you?

01:35:48.082 --> 01:35:51.583
Never mind.
I might throw up if you tell me.

01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:20.705
Are you all right?

01:36:22.406 --> 01:36:25.184
You tell me, you know me so, so well.

01:36:27.868 --> 01:36:28.839
Is that all you have?

01:36:29.835 --> 01:36:31.345
All right, that is all you will need.

01:36:53.412 --> 01:36:54.687
I remember when I went from lookout

01:36:54.777 --> 01:36:56.814
to handling quarters
to straight out scrambling.

01:36:58.559 --> 01:37:01.503
When I was a kid,
I used to stand right out here...

01:37:02.331 --> 01:37:03.990
...and watch Nicky Barnes
and his green Corniche

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.814
drive up and down
Saint Nicholas Avenue.

01:37:07.459 --> 01:37:09.207
Those were the superstars of the game.

01:37:11.961 --> 01:37:13.329
But they are not around anymore.

01:37:15.028 --> 01:37:18.443
It is the end of the road for me, Gus.
That's it.

01:37:19.679 --> 01:37:21.378
I am turning everything over to Ray.

01:37:22.732 --> 01:37:24.776
You can deal with him from now on.
He will call you.

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:28.842
I am done. I am finished.

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.641
So, tell me.

01:38:10.806 --> 01:38:12.978
You know that plane
that you wanted to get yourself on?

01:38:13.139 --> 01:38:14.019
It is leaving tonight.

01:38:14.994 --> 01:38:16.020
And we will be on it.

01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:23.185
Look. Ray, listen to me.

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:27.403
Go on, man, I mean, shit,
you're getting out of here, right?

01:38:29.288 --> 01:38:31.785
Get a few days, man,
go on down to the motherfucking islands,

01:38:31.876 --> 01:38:33.184
chill the little honey and shit.

01:38:35.202 --> 01:38:37.911
Shit, everybody needs a vacation
every now and then, right?

01:38:43.888 --> 01:38:44.749
I am out of here.

01:38:50.216 --> 01:38:52.857
-I do not want anything to happen to you.
-Do not worry, baby.

01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:54.520
Your big brother is here.

01:38:54.803 --> 01:38:55.653
Ray.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:01.725
If you change your mind...
Hey, man, I am still your brother.

01:39:03.099 --> 01:39:03.949
All right.

01:39:07.239 --> 01:39:08.150
I am going to make it.

01:39:13.461 --> 01:39:14.449
I am going to fix it.

01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:23.584
It is going to be all right.

01:39:29.885 --> 01:39:31.048
It is going to be all right.

01:39:47.901 --> 01:39:48.818
Here you go, boss.

01:39:49.823 --> 01:39:51.525
This shit is so pure, it is still brown.

01:39:52.822 --> 01:39:55.375
Now, this has not been stepped on
or spanked down at all.

01:39:56.735 --> 01:39:59.350
Supposed it take a five,
but I would not put a but of three on it.

01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:26.940
Hey, what you going to do with that?

01:40:33.075 --> 01:40:34.690
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah.

01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:37.654
All right, good. Because I do not know
if they got stores in North Carolina.

01:40:37.744 --> 01:40:39.506
They got stores in North Carolina.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:41.085
I love it anyway.

01:40:41.461 --> 01:40:42.549
I never seen this place...

01:40:46.591 --> 01:40:48.039
-We should get some bikes.
-No.

01:40:48.129 --> 01:40:49.167
-Not yet?
-No.

01:40:49.279 --> 01:40:50.350
I got this one right here.

01:40:54.262 --> 01:40:57.347
Look, baby, I got to make a quick stop.

01:40:57.927 --> 01:40:58.777
For what?

01:41:00.619 --> 01:41:01.637
I want to see my father.

01:41:02.913 --> 01:41:04.198
I thought your father was dead.

01:41:06.314 --> 01:41:07.247
No, he is not.

01:41:20.377 --> 01:41:22.578
Should have told me
you do not feel like that anymore.

01:41:40.777 --> 01:41:41.627
Raynathan.

01:41:46.019 --> 01:41:47.086
You know how...

01:41:49.392 --> 01:41:51.859
...me and your mother
use to fight about...

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.081
...sending you to church
when you were little.

01:42:01.034 --> 01:42:02.040
That was a long time ago,

01:42:05.203 --> 01:42:07.334
I went to mother AME Zion church.

01:42:09.555 --> 01:42:10.469
Just every Sunday.

01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:17.648
They had a visiting minister...

01:42:20.072 --> 01:42:21.063
...visiting Durham.

01:42:23.716 --> 01:42:24.763
Durham, North Carolina.

01:42:30.278 --> 01:42:34.953
He started reading from Matthew 13.

01:42:40.829 --> 01:42:42.219
"And so it shall be."

01:42:44.699 --> 01:42:45.819
"At the end of the world..."

01:42:48.922 --> 01:42:53.457
"...the angels shall come forth."

01:42:56.394 --> 01:42:57.614
"And sever the wicked..."

01:42:59.436 --> 01:43:00.369
"...from the just."

01:43:03.721 --> 01:43:09.724
That minister, he went on and on.

01:43:13.563 --> 01:43:17.776
About hell and damnation.

01:43:20.823 --> 01:43:21.756
Judgment day.

01:43:23.914 --> 01:43:24.764
Salvation.

01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:31.588
Through the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:43:36.845 --> 01:43:37.849
Well, I got up...

01:43:41.457 --> 01:43:42.634
...and I got out of there.

01:43:46.467 --> 01:43:47.401
I ran...

01:43:49.725 --> 01:43:52.186
...all the way up to 113th street.

01:43:59.583 --> 01:44:01.865
And I told some friends what I had heard.

01:44:03.023 --> 01:44:06.557
And they were the baddest motherfuckers
on the block.

01:44:07.703 --> 01:44:08.553
OK.

01:44:10.399 --> 01:44:13.290
I mean, those guys were the first ones
to skin, pop.

01:44:15.539 --> 01:44:16.539
And they just laughed.

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:22.938
And they gave me a bag...

01:44:27.056 --> 01:44:28.056
...and some works.

01:44:32.338 --> 01:44:37.149
And he said, here is your God.

01:44:39.942 --> 01:44:41.251
Motherfuckers.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.750
And for a while, it quieted the voice.

01:44:56.139 --> 01:44:57.139
And I lost...

01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.547
...the only woman who ever truly loved me.

01:45:11.737 --> 01:45:13.028
I lost my sons.

01:45:17.496 --> 01:45:18.822
I lost my babies.

01:45:23.248 --> 01:45:24.403
I lost my money...

01:45:28.733 --> 01:45:30.267
...and I lost my self respect.

01:45:35.536 --> 01:45:37.060
Motherfucking shit.

01:45:42.358 --> 01:45:43.208
Oh, Ray.

01:45:47.675 --> 01:45:48.564
Raynathan...

01:45:51.435 --> 01:45:52.285
...my baby.

01:45:56.897 --> 01:45:57.747
I am sorry.

01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:08.164
I am sorry, baby.

01:46:22.334 --> 01:46:23.184
Oh, God.

01:47:50.686 --> 01:47:51.565
My brother.

01:47:53.473 --> 01:47:54.540
The man is here.

01:47:56.924 --> 01:48:00.151
We spoke with your brother,
he told us all about it.

01:48:01.238 --> 01:48:02.088
Salud.

01:48:07.191 --> 01:48:08.041
Salud.

01:48:34.643 --> 01:48:35.493
Pops?

01:48:52.994 --> 01:48:55.170
I do not know
what my brother told you OK, but...

01:48:59.494 --> 01:49:01.584
...I am not happy
with the current arrangement.

01:49:02.192 --> 01:49:03.883
Oh, what the fuck are we talking about?

01:49:05.369 --> 01:49:06.417
We both knows.

01:49:08.971 --> 01:49:11.548
You are not the only candy store
in town no more.

01:49:15.975 --> 01:49:18.311
So you are not using my services anymore,
Ray?

01:49:18.723 --> 01:49:22.152
He is just speaking his mind, pop.
No harm done. Right, Ray?

01:49:22.809 --> 01:49:24.322
Yeah, I think that the fact
that he is here, Gus,

01:49:24.412 --> 01:49:25.903
means he is not inflexible.

01:49:26.408 --> 01:49:30.190
What is this, the fucking UN?
I do not need any interpreters.

01:49:31.019 --> 01:49:32.352
Let me and Ray talk!

01:49:38.457 --> 01:49:39.324
You know, Ray.

01:49:41.089 --> 01:49:43.127
I have always admired you
and your brother.

01:49:44.555 --> 01:49:47.248
You guys went from scrambling
on the block for me...

01:49:48.584 --> 01:49:50.791
...to making enough money to buy from me.

01:49:51.803 --> 01:49:53.584
And going into business for yourselves.

01:49:54.826 --> 01:49:55.723
And you did it...

01:49:56.775 --> 01:49:58.842
...without the help of a junkie father.

01:49:59.781 --> 01:50:02.484
And started using the stuff
he was suppose to be selling.

01:50:03.816 --> 01:50:07.266
And now it is like,
like you are to good for me.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.451
I damn near treated you
like I treat my own son.

01:50:13.459 --> 01:50:15.067
And I never even called you nigger.

01:50:16.985 --> 01:50:20.108
Now these men standing here
are like family.

01:50:21.417 --> 01:50:24.031
And you do not disrespect family.

01:50:24.167 --> 01:50:25.543
You can not win.

01:50:26.969 --> 01:50:31.832
You can not say, "Well, fuck so and so
because there are other suppliers."

01:50:32.845 --> 01:50:34.262
Not on my block!

01:50:35.045 --> 01:50:36.645
Not in my house!

01:50:40.466 --> 01:50:42.015
I ain't got no beef with you.

01:50:43.434 --> 01:50:44.322
Excuse me!

01:50:50.690 --> 01:50:54.389
I said,
I ain't got no static with you, Gus.

01:50:58.693 --> 01:50:59.742
I'm scared of you.

01:51:06.874 --> 01:51:07.724
Look...

01:51:12.391 --> 01:51:14.018
...I'm ready to cut a deal, OK?

01:51:17.127 --> 01:51:19.275
Lolly can bust out 112th street.

01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:22.435
For 15 percent of the pizza.

01:51:24.258 --> 01:51:25.108
Yeah.

01:51:27.119 --> 01:51:28.119
I am with that.

01:51:29.931 --> 01:51:31.072
Attaboy, Ray.

01:51:33.407 --> 01:51:35.442
I am glad we can come to an understanding.

01:51:39.238 --> 01:51:40.314
Thanks. God bless.

01:52:22.288 --> 01:52:25.018
Hey, guys, I thought I would get a cup
of coffee and a cannoli.

01:52:26.497 --> 01:52:27.347
Gun!

01:52:48.108 --> 01:52:50.355
Thanks for never calling me nigger.

01:52:54.435 --> 01:52:56.069
I ain't scared of you, Gus.

01:53:01.373 --> 01:53:02.695
This is for my father.

01:53:29.174 --> 01:53:30.024
Roe.

01:53:31.467 --> 01:53:32.317
Roe!

01:53:33.313 --> 01:53:34.163
Roe!

01:53:36.907 --> 01:53:37.757
Ray!

01:53:39.228 --> 01:53:40.617
Roeme, you don't have to go, man.

01:53:44.045 --> 01:53:45.326
I took care of everybody.

01:53:46.645 --> 01:53:47.660
There is nobody left.

01:53:50.217 --> 01:53:53.999
It is just the two of us, Roe,
just like the old days.

01:53:54.099 --> 01:53:55.591
You ain't have to leave now, man.

01:53:56.970 --> 01:53:58.331
Nobody going to hurt us.

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.345
You can stay now, Roe.

01:54:00.849 --> 01:54:01.982
You can stay now.

01:54:03.505 --> 01:54:05.879
Ray, AR is dead.

01:54:11.725 --> 01:54:14.971
-He is dead, Ray.
-AR is dead.

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:18.534
I know.

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:23.994
I put him out of his misery.

01:54:29.819 --> 01:54:31.057
I sent him home, Roe.

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.003
Oh, no. Oh, no! No! You killed him?

01:54:38.093 --> 01:54:39.672
Look, he was hurting, man.

01:54:39.772 --> 01:54:41.866
Ray, he was our father, man!

01:54:41.966 --> 01:54:44.931
He was our father! He gave you life!

01:54:47.635 --> 01:54:49.278
What gave you the right to touch him!

01:54:50.058 --> 01:54:54.105
Oh, no, no, no.

01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:56.081
You had no right, man!

01:54:56.818 --> 01:54:57.952
You had no right!

01:54:58.987 --> 01:55:00.202
What do we got now?

01:55:00.811 --> 01:55:01.707
What do we got?

01:55:04.325 --> 01:55:07.596
Each other. We got each other, Roe.

01:55:07.696 --> 01:55:10.209
Oh, Ray! I can not fucking believe you!

01:55:10.299 --> 01:55:13.164
Roemello. Baby, come on now, let's go.

01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:16.446
Come on, baby, let's go. Come on.

01:55:21.285 --> 01:55:22.285
You lied to me.

01:55:23.343 --> 01:55:24.689
What are you talking about?

01:55:25.445 --> 01:55:29.223
You are leaving me, man!
You lied to me, man!

01:55:32.877 --> 01:55:34.386
No! No Ray!

01:55:34.486 --> 01:55:35.473
Stop!

01:55:35.573 --> 01:55:36.769
Stop, Ray!

01:55:36.869 --> 01:55:38.025
No! No!

01:55:39.311 --> 01:55:40.733
Ro? Roeme?

01:55:41.644 --> 01:55:42.518
-Why Ray?
-Roeme?

01:55:42.608 --> 01:55:43.999
-Roemello!
-Roeme?

01:55:44.099 --> 01:55:45.686
-Roeme?
-Roemello!

01:55:45.786 --> 01:55:47.478
No!

01:55:47.578 --> 01:55:48.753
Get away from him!

01:55:49.566 --> 01:55:52.073
No!

01:55:56.968 --> 01:55:59.497
No!

01:56:56.517 --> 01:56:58.317
<i>And that is the way it ends.</i>

01:56:59.804 --> 01:57:00.937
<i>With a beginning.</i>

01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:13.047
<i>And so this time, after so much pain</i>

01:57:13.147 --> 01:57:14.382
<i>and so much death...</i>

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.413
<i>...there is still life.</i>

01:57:22.878 --> 01:57:26.637
<i>And where there was despair.
Now, there is hope.</i>

01:57:51.823 --> 01:57:55.068
<i>Hope that man, a little one,
comes around and smiles at you.</i>

01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:58.601
<i>You can say to yourself, say to him...</i>

01:57:59.709 --> 01:58:02.809
<i>...no, son, this will not happen again.</i>

01:58:03.691 --> 01:58:04.590
<i>Yeah.</i>
