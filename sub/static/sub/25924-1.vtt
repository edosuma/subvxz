01:43.435 --> 01:45.305
<i>Kit?</i>

01:48.674 --> 01:51.311
<i>Wake up, Kit.</i>

02:35.454 --> 02:36.689
Dad?

02:39.758 --> 02:41.824
Everything's okay, honey.

02:41.826 --> 02:43.729
Everything's okay.

02:45.997 --> 02:48.298
Everything's okay.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.768
Everything's
okay. Everything's okay.

02:51.770 --> 02:54.274
Everything's okay.

02:55.774 --> 02:59.810
And I realize now that
my behavior needs improving.

02:59.812 --> 03:04.447
But I really feel like I have
my anger under control now,

03:04.449 --> 03:06.850
and I'm ready
to move past all this

03:06.852 --> 03:09.953
and really let go
of the past too.

03:09.955 --> 03:12.923
I mean, the therapy,

03:12.925 --> 03:15.758
working with you
all this time,

03:15.760 --> 03:18.828
it's helped me to
understand that...

03:18.830 --> 03:22.332
my behavior
needs to change.

03:22.334 --> 03:23.699
So, thank you.

03:23.701 --> 03:25.901
Really.

03:25.903 --> 03:27.806
Thank you.

03:33.012 --> 03:36.446
Two suspensions,
a misdemeanor arrest,

03:36.448 --> 03:38.749
and a still-pending
arson charge.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.883
I didn't do it.

03:40.885 --> 03:44.287
Not that.

03:44.289 --> 03:45.621
Oh, and an "F" in gym.

03:45.623 --> 03:47.858
How does anybody
even get an "F" in gym?

03:47.860 --> 03:50.661
- I never go to effin' gym.
- Kit!

03:50.663 --> 03:52.929
That's what we're up against,
right here. Look, if...

03:52.931 --> 03:55.766
Who the hell is she?

03:55.768 --> 03:57.967
As I said,
I'm Dr. Sinclair.

03:57.969 --> 04:01.937
Yeah, but why are you here? One
therapist at a time is plenty.

04:01.939 --> 04:04.740
- I'm not a therapist, Kit.
- You said you're a doctor.

04:04.742 --> 04:06.977
PhD, 19th-century
literature.

04:06.979 --> 04:09.312
Honey, Dr. Sinclair
represents a school.

04:09.314 --> 04:12.948
Actually, it's more of an academy
run by a remarkable headmistress,

04:12.950 --> 04:16.452
where girls like you, Kit, have gone on
to do incredible things with their lives.

04:16.454 --> 04:18.954
Girls like me end up on meds
and in and out

04:18.956 --> 04:20.757
of offices like this
for the rest of their lives.

04:20.759 --> 04:24.264
- That's not fair.
- All that could change, Kit.

04:27.098 --> 04:29.433
It's an option, Kit.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.368
We don't have many
of those left.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.803
What was
that girl's name,

04:32.805 --> 04:34.971
the one that doctor said
went to that school?

04:34.973 --> 04:37.406
- The painter?
- Her too.

04:37.408 --> 04:40.377
The point is, this school,
Blackwood, it sounds legit.

04:40.379 --> 04:43.480
- "Legit." Yeah. Thanks, Dave.
- Don't be mean.

04:43.482 --> 04:46.615
- And call him...
- No, I'll call him "Dave".

04:46.617 --> 04:48.784
- Dave.
- I actually prefer "David."

04:48.786 --> 04:50.820
Like I said,
it's an option.

04:50.822 --> 04:54.091
- Well, I opt against it.
- You made your own bed with all of this.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.892
- You still don't believe me.
- I know that your lawyer didn't,

04:56.894 --> 04:58.562
but that didn't stop him
from charging me.

04:58.564 --> 05:02.466
- You're my mother.
- That is right. I am.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.899
You're starting at Blackwood
next week, Kit.

05:03.901 --> 05:05.969
Are you...
Are you kidding me?

05:05.971 --> 05:08.704
I said the same thing.
Place is frickin' expensive.

05:08.706 --> 05:10.807
But, you know,
totally worth it.

05:10.809 --> 05:13.510
So what was all that bullshit
about options, then?

05:13.512 --> 05:15.348
Pretty much bullshit.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.819
It's stupid!

05:23.822 --> 05:26.759
So, that went well.

05:42.141 --> 05:44.544
Do you remember
when that was taken?

05:47.112 --> 05:49.945
We were going for a hike
one day.

05:49.947 --> 05:53.048
You had just turned six
a few weeks before.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.185
So we thought the hike
would be too much for you,

05:55.187 --> 05:58.391
but you were
determined to try.

05:59.891 --> 06:02.091
You started it,

06:02.093 --> 06:04.060
and you finished it.

06:04.062 --> 06:06.663
Because that's the way
that you were.

06:06.665 --> 06:10.567
Of all the things
your father admired you for,

06:10.569 --> 06:13.736
I think he admired you most
for that.

06:13.738 --> 06:15.108
For hiking?

06:17.910 --> 06:19.175
For trying.

07:12.930 --> 07:14.901
Holy shit.

07:18.202 --> 07:20.072
Oh, wow.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.745
Kit?

07:27.913 --> 07:28.978
Honey?

07:32.684 --> 07:33.886
Come on.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.473
Hello?

07:55.774 --> 07:57.543
Hello!

08:06.785 --> 08:08.788
Oh, my.

08:29.942 --> 08:32.308
Jeez.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.746
How old do you think
that chandelier is?

08:35.913 --> 08:38.780
Ten thousand years old?
I don't know.

08:38.783 --> 08:41.818
It would be 207 years old,

08:41.820 --> 08:44.887
were it not an appallingly
bad replica.

08:44.889 --> 08:48.190
- Welcome to Blackwood.
- "Madame Durette"?

08:48.192 --> 08:50.727
Duret.
And this is Miss Orlonsky.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.668
Hey.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.738
- Where are the other students?
- They don't arrive until tomorrow.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.940
- Why did you bring me here today?
- Not now.

09:03.942 --> 09:06.843
Allow me to show you
to your quarters, Kathryn.

09:06.845 --> 09:09.045
I'm afraid
it only gets darker.

09:09.047 --> 09:11.714
The electrical system
is very old,

09:11.716 --> 09:16.151
and getting an electrician can be a
bit complicated all the way out here.

09:16.153 --> 09:18.188
So how do you see?

09:18.190 --> 09:20.790
Your eyes will adjust,
I assure you.

09:20.792 --> 09:23.660
Will your honor us tonight
with your presence?

09:23.662 --> 09:26.831
Oh, we'd like to,
but we have to get back.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.032
Kathryn.

09:30.034 --> 09:33.069
That part of the building
is off limits to the students.

09:33.071 --> 09:35.772
It isn't perfectly safe.

09:35.774 --> 09:38.577
- Where does it go?
- Please.

09:43.981 --> 09:46.148
This is where
you'll be sleeping.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.386
At Blackwood, we believe
beauty enriches the spirit.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.720
It's definitely dramatic.

09:51.722 --> 09:55.190
A young woman should be
at ease among lovely things.

09:55.192 --> 09:57.926
Don't you agree?

09:57.928 --> 09:59.228
Back up, lady.

09:59.230 --> 10:02.198
Well, Miss Duret...

10:02.200 --> 10:05.068
- May I ask where the ladies' room is?
- Of course.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.070
Just down the hall.
Follow me.

10:31.196 --> 10:34.030
- She's changed.
- Changed?

10:34.032 --> 10:37.233
She's... She's not
my little girl anymore.

10:37.235 --> 10:40.103
Nor should she be. She's 17.

10:40.105 --> 10:41.907
No, what I mean is...

10:43.008 --> 10:45.175
It's her mental state.
It's...

10:45.177 --> 10:47.346
It's so aggressive.

10:53.418 --> 10:55.118
Listen, Kit.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.253
If things get weird here,
just call us, okay?

10:58.255 --> 10:59.888
It's already weird here.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.925
- Yeah.
- Hey.

11:02.927 --> 11:04.393
This is going to be
good for you.

11:04.395 --> 11:06.762
Even with my aggressive
mental state?

11:06.764 --> 11:08.363
Come here.

11:08.365 --> 11:10.436
I love you.

11:11.436 --> 11:12.969
So much.

11:12.971 --> 11:15.271
I just want
what's best for you.

11:15.273 --> 11:16.841
Okay.

11:27.284 --> 11:29.120
Hello?

11:30.822 --> 11:32.758
Madame Duret?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.395
Hello?

11:40.999 --> 11:42.735
Hello?

11:46.837 --> 11:48.772
Huh.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.309
Yeah, much better.

12:01.219 --> 12:04.023
- Oh. Good to know.
- Dinner.

12:08.293 --> 12:09.861
Medicine.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.235
Can I see it?

12:19.370 --> 12:22.073
Yep. That's the stuff.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.345
- What?
- Show me.

12:30.347 --> 12:33.184
Are you kidding me?

12:39.124 --> 12:41.026
Thanks.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.265
This definitely
doesn't suck.

13:18.429 --> 13:20.265
Who's there?

13:26.904 --> 13:28.506
Hello?

14:25.996 --> 14:29.967
- Ah. There you are, Kathryn.
- Uh, I thought that...

14:30.999 --> 14:33.036
Fall in line, please.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.103
Hi. I'm Ashley.

14:35.105 --> 14:37.076
Kit.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.217
Veronica.

14:48.219 --> 14:49.719
That's a bold look.

14:49.721 --> 14:52.088
Allow me to welcome you all
to Blackwood.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.555
Wait. That's it?

14:53.557 --> 14:55.491
There are only
five of us?

14:55.493 --> 14:58.294
We accept only truly gifted
individuals.

14:58.296 --> 15:00.162
Trust me,
I'm not gifted.

15:00.164 --> 15:02.431
But I assure you, Sierra,
you are.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.566
There's a talent
inside each of you,

15:04.568 --> 15:07.436
and I intend
to find it.

15:07.438 --> 15:11.239
Now, in order to thrive
here at Blackwood,

15:11.241 --> 15:15.210
I will need your absolute
attention, no distractions.

15:15.212 --> 15:18.180
So Miss Orlonsky will be
collecting your cell phones.

15:18.182 --> 15:21.217
- That's not fair.
- What?

15:21.219 --> 15:23.018
You will each get one call

15:23.020 --> 15:25.521
to someone of your choosing
in the middle of the term.

15:25.523 --> 15:27.256
That's it? One call?

15:27.258 --> 15:29.257
- Did you tell our parents?
- This is ridiculous.

15:29.259 --> 15:31.361
- I want to speak to my lawyer.
- This is so stupid.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.262
This is so dumb.

15:37.735 --> 15:40.670
- This is stupid.
- Give me...

15:40.672 --> 15:43.039
- We'll get Internet though, right?
- I'm afraid not.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.674
- What?
- Is this a joke?

15:44.676 --> 15:47.075
It's an alternative to prison.

15:47.077 --> 15:50.313
You've hurt people,
destroyed property,

15:50.315 --> 15:53.315
made life difficult
for those around you.

15:53.317 --> 15:56.018
Arson, grand larceny,

15:56.020 --> 16:00.123
drugs, assault,
and all of the above.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.459
Your choices have been yours
and yours alone,

16:03.461 --> 16:07.063
and the consequences of your actions
have brought each of you here.

16:07.065 --> 16:10.532
That sounds an awful lot like what
they say when you get to prison.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.234
Look around, all of you.

16:12.236 --> 16:14.670
There are no bars
on the windows.

16:14.672 --> 16:18.241
And while we are rather
remotely located,

16:18.243 --> 16:22.177
it's entirely possible
to reach the nearest town.

16:22.179 --> 16:24.147
But why would you?

16:24.149 --> 16:26.416
My terms may seem harsh,

16:26.418 --> 16:29.786
but the price of an extraordinary
life is an extraordinary effort.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.820
And make no mistake,

16:31.822 --> 16:35.791
each one of you is quite
extraordinary.

16:35.793 --> 16:37.826
In your old lives,

16:37.828 --> 16:41.296
people ridiculed you, they
punished you, they cast you out,

16:41.298 --> 16:43.166
they laughed at you.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.469
If you follow my instruction
and allow me to raise you

16:46.471 --> 16:50.573
to the great heights
I know you can reach,

16:50.575 --> 16:54.013
no one will ever
laugh at you again.

17:16.134 --> 17:17.699
You a creeper
or something?

17:17.701 --> 17:20.869
- No, I was just...
- Staring in some bitches' rooms?

17:20.872 --> 17:23.839
I'm not a creeper,
or whatever you said.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.807
You're her, aren't you?

17:25.809 --> 17:28.643
What are you
talking about?

17:28.645 --> 17:31.213
There's always
at least one.

17:31.215 --> 17:34.816
Someone who thinks I won't smother them
with a pillow while they're asleep,

17:34.818 --> 17:37.487
until I smother them with a
pillow while they're asleep.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.622
Well, you'd better bring
more than a pillow.

17:39.624 --> 17:42.391
Do you two mind killing each
other somewhere else?

17:42.393 --> 17:45.163
Some of us are trying to
hate this place in peace.

18:33.912 --> 18:36.582
Dinner is ready.

18:51.496 --> 18:53.365
Sorry.

18:57.801 --> 19:00.436
Arithmetic, art,

19:00.438 --> 19:02.537
literature, music:

19:02.539 --> 19:04.472
the four pillars
of knowledge.

19:04.474 --> 19:06.642
That will be your core
curriculum here at Blackwood.

19:06.644 --> 19:08.643
Do we have to wear those
uniforms?

19:08.645 --> 19:12.414
Let me introduce your mathematics
teacher, Professor Farley.

19:12.416 --> 19:14.382
And for literature,

19:14.384 --> 19:18.321
whom I believe some of you
have already met, Dr. Sinclair.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.823
And proving his excellent timing
at this very moment,

19:20.825 --> 19:23.629
your music instructor,
Jules Duret.

19:26.663 --> 19:27.930
Wait.

19:27.932 --> 19:30.533
- "Duret," Duret?
- Jules is my son.

19:30.535 --> 19:32.000
He just received his degree

19:32.002 --> 19:35.439
from the Royal Academy of Music
in London.

19:36.941 --> 19:39.441
We're all thrilled
you're here.

19:39.443 --> 19:42.978
Madame Duret has carefully
chosen each one of you.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.347
For what?

19:45.349 --> 19:47.516
For greatness.

19:47.518 --> 19:50.385
I understand you used to play piano.
I'm excited to hear you play.

19:50.387 --> 19:52.888
Don't be. I haven't played
since I was nine.

19:52.890 --> 19:55.857
Well, then, your bad habits
won't be hard to break.

19:55.859 --> 19:58.794
- I can play the flute.
- That's wonderful.

19:58.796 --> 20:02.668
All of you, please, enjoy.

20:19.616 --> 20:21.787
Right, my numb pills.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.670
Always nice
chatting with you.

21:06.663 --> 21:10.565
Your first essay is on Proust's
<i>In Search of Lost Time.</i>

21:10.567 --> 21:13.335
- How long do we have to finish it?
- Five days.

21:13.337 --> 21:16.939
What? Five days?
The thing's a brick.

21:16.941 --> 21:19.574
Which, if the Three Little Pigs
have taught us anything,

21:19.576 --> 21:22.844
is the perfect material
to build a strong foundation.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.447
Why can't we just
read that instead?

21:24.449 --> 21:27.115
- What do we have to write about?
- Ah.

21:27.117 --> 21:29.852
Love.

21:29.854 --> 21:31.853
Needing it.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.657
Finding it.

21:34.659 --> 21:37.729
- And what it means to lose it.
- So it's a love story?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.629
In a way, yes.

21:40.631 --> 21:43.665
Every story is.
Anyway,

21:43.667 --> 21:46.469
let's get to it.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.536
Does anyone know
how to make pink?

21:48.538 --> 21:50.373
Shh! Girls.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.777
Focus.

21:54.612 --> 21:56.581
What's this?

21:57.949 --> 22:01.116
This is Blackwood,
and this is fire.

22:01.118 --> 22:04.018
And you're...

22:04.020 --> 22:06.555
somewhere in there, screaming
for help or something,

22:06.557 --> 22:08.090
I don't know.

22:08.092 --> 22:11.626
And you're
proud of this?

22:11.628 --> 22:14.162
I think
it's a work of art.

22:14.164 --> 22:17.400
Do you know what I see
when I look at this?

22:17.402 --> 22:19.634
I see a young woman
that's frightened to death

22:19.636 --> 22:23.506
she doesn't have the talent
to survive here.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.509
Perhaps she's right.

22:29.146 --> 22:31.546
It isn't atrocious.

22:31.548 --> 22:34.952
- Does that mean it's good?
- Far from it. Carry on.

22:41.659 --> 22:43.592
Mathematics.

22:43.594 --> 22:47.595
Everything in this world can be
explained with mathematics.

22:47.597 --> 22:49.698
What does that explain?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.801
I have no idea.

22:51.803 --> 22:54.202
I was hoping
one of you could tell me.

22:54.204 --> 22:57.640
As Galileo said
centuries ago,

22:57.642 --> 23:00.575
"The great book of nature
can only be read

23:00.577 --> 23:03.511
by those who understand
the language

23:03.513 --> 23:05.815
in which it was written,

23:05.817 --> 23:08.183
and that language is..."

23:08.185 --> 23:11.019
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What's happening here?

23:11.021 --> 23:14.125
- She lit my hair on fire.
- Then why isn't your hair on fire?

23:15.526 --> 23:17.860
Aah!

23:17.862 --> 23:19.228
Ladies, please.

23:19.230 --> 23:22.099
Get off me!

23:24.868 --> 23:28.139
I believe
she's learned her lesson.

23:41.117 --> 23:42.684
Okay, okay,
stop, please.

23:42.686 --> 23:45.554
That's enough.

23:45.556 --> 23:49.158
- It's been a while.
- Giovanni Pergolesi, Franz Schubert,

23:49.160 --> 23:52.260
Mozart, William Kestler.

23:52.262 --> 23:56.565
All were virtuoso composers
who, sadly, died by age 40.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.767
The aim here is to find
what best suits you.

23:58.769 --> 24:01.202
- Which instrument?
- You are the instrument, Izzy.

24:01.204 --> 24:04.239
All of you. We simply need
to find which of these devices...

24:04.241 --> 24:07.075
because that's
all they are, devices...

24:07.077 --> 24:10.915
best express
your artistic spirit.

24:14.218 --> 24:16.121
You're going to help me.

25:18.816 --> 25:20.885
I'd bone him.

25:30.827 --> 25:32.795
Kit. Come in.

25:32.797 --> 25:35.998
Just give me one moment
with this, please.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.199
Were they all your mom's
students?

25:38.201 --> 25:41.603
That is her wall of fame, yes. She's
been teaching for many years.

25:41.605 --> 25:43.972
London, Paris, Berlin...

25:43.974 --> 25:46.976
None of those places
were worth staying in?

25:46.978 --> 25:49.844
She wants me to start
working with you

25:49.846 --> 25:52.213
outside of our classroom
instruction.

25:52.215 --> 25:56.352
Apparently, she saw a musical
quality in your painting.

25:56.354 --> 25:59.755
You are aware of,
like, technology, right?

25:59.757 --> 26:02.324
I always found analogue
recording to be warmer.

26:02.326 --> 26:04.293
- You're not recording this, are you?
- Would you like me to?

26:04.295 --> 26:05.693
No. Definitely not.

26:05.695 --> 26:07.932
Then I won't.

26:16.307 --> 26:18.673
Sorry.

26:18.675 --> 26:21.043
That's, um...
You're holding back.

26:21.045 --> 26:22.745
It's just...

26:26.817 --> 26:29.921
Um...

26:32.355 --> 26:34.722
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

26:36.126 --> 26:38.329
But you're too much
in your own head.

26:39.696 --> 26:41.098
Why?

26:45.036 --> 26:47.135
My dad...

26:47.137 --> 26:50.139
I've been thinking
about him lately.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.440
We used to own
a small upright piano.

26:52.442 --> 26:55.113
He bought it for me
when I was little.

26:57.414 --> 26:59.783
Why does that
make you sad?

27:00.984 --> 27:02.918
He died.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.754
I mean, it happened a long time ago.
I was only nine.

27:05.756 --> 27:12.294
Um, he was on his way back
from a business trip, and...

27:12.296 --> 27:14.665
the weather was bad, so...

27:16.433 --> 27:19.037
Guess he should've taken
the next flight.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.907
They're never far,
you know?

27:29.913 --> 27:31.313
Part of them carries on

27:31.315 --> 27:34.016
well after their
final note is struck.

27:34.018 --> 27:36.084
Do you really
believe that?

27:36.086 --> 27:38.219
This isn't
an easy process, Kit.

27:38.221 --> 27:42.490
Nor is this the happiest place
in the world, I give you that.

27:42.492 --> 27:45.059
But if you trust me,

27:45.061 --> 27:49.498
and if you give all this
a chance, if you try,

27:49.500 --> 27:52.804
I promise you you'll be amazed
at what you're capable of.

28:21.766 --> 28:26.267
<i>"The tenderness is gone, gone.</i>

28:26.269 --> 28:29.537
<i>Fear all that I have said,
love,</i>

28:29.539 --> 28:34.109
but divide your senses,
for you alone

28:34.111 --> 28:37.478
are the maker of light.

28:37.480 --> 28:43.218
Castles and castles
and castles of silk.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.024
The tenderness is gone."

28:53.029 --> 28:56.798
It's beautiful, Ashley.

28:56.800 --> 29:01.003
There are traces of the
Romantics, of Keats, of Byron.

29:01.005 --> 29:04.206
But no, the tone, the meter... there's
something altogether different.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.941
- There's an incongruity to it.
- Where did you copy it from?

29:06.943 --> 29:08.946
I didn't copy it.

29:10.314 --> 29:13.250
It just sort of
came to me.

29:14.852 --> 29:17.151
Excellent.

29:17.153 --> 29:19.188
Quite excellent.

29:19.190 --> 29:23.795
You're fast becoming the
princess of mathematics, Izzy.

30:02.932 --> 30:04.335
Sierra?

30:08.071 --> 30:10.140
Sierra!

30:17.114 --> 30:19.483
Excellent work,
Sierra.

30:21.417 --> 30:24.151
<i>Listen to it.</i>

30:24.153 --> 30:25.557
Hear it.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.192
The wind. The creek.

30:31.194 --> 30:33.130
It's a symphony.

30:34.898 --> 30:37.132
Can you hear it?

30:37.134 --> 30:39.269
Yeah, I think so.

30:41.538 --> 30:44.338
"How happy I am to walk
among the woods,

30:44.340 --> 30:46.240
the trees, the rocks,

30:46.242 --> 30:49.378
for the woods,
the trees, the rocks

30:49.380 --> 30:52.383
give man
the resonance he needs."

30:53.416 --> 30:55.352
Beethoven said that.

31:01.157 --> 31:03.394
Close your eyes, Kit.

31:09.133 --> 31:10.934
Completely.

31:18.642 --> 31:20.644
Listen to it.

31:42.165 --> 31:44.099
I can't hear you.

31:44.101 --> 31:46.204
<i>I'm here.</i>

31:48.038 --> 31:50.639
- <i>Open your eyes.</i>
- Dad?

31:58.048 --> 31:59.581
- Kit?
- Uh...

31:59.583 --> 32:02.351
- You okay?
- We were at the river.

32:02.353 --> 32:04.286
Yes, for almost
three hours.

32:04.288 --> 32:09.091
- Did you bring me here?
- I would say you brought me.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.192
Oh.

32:11.194 --> 32:13.728
Right. Of course.

32:15.365 --> 32:16.731
Dinnertime.

32:16.733 --> 32:20.134
Come on. Let's go.
Enough for today.

32:20.136 --> 32:21.673
<i>Allez, allez.</i>

32:25.476 --> 32:29.180
My apologies.
Kathryn and I were by the creek.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.716
Doing what, exactly?

32:34.050 --> 32:36.450
We were...

32:36.452 --> 32:39.153
listening.

32:39.155 --> 32:41.456
May I go to my room?

32:41.458 --> 32:43.190
I'm not hungry.

32:43.192 --> 32:45.259
I need to get back
to my work.

32:45.261 --> 32:48.529
Of course, darling.
Work comes first.

32:48.531 --> 32:51.234
Miss Orlonsky will
take care of you.

32:56.306 --> 32:59.074
Listening to what,
Kit?

32:59.076 --> 33:01.176
Oh. Uh...

33:01.178 --> 33:02.981
It was like...

33:04.381 --> 33:08.419
trees, wind,
nature stuff.

33:48.625 --> 33:52.760
I think that one's right
after all.

33:52.762 --> 33:56.666
- So you're, like, a genius or something?
- I barely passed algebra.

34:02.538 --> 34:05.373
I can't explain it.
Any of it.

34:05.375 --> 34:08.141
But I like it,

34:08.143 --> 34:10.411
being good at something.

34:10.414 --> 34:13.581
Not being the one that everyone
always thinks is broken.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.286
I like it.

34:16.652 --> 34:18.355
Don't you?

34:26.597 --> 34:29.429
Get away! Get away!

34:29.431 --> 34:31.766
Ashley? Ashley!
Ashley!

34:31.768 --> 34:33.802
Let us in! Ashley!

34:37.608 --> 34:40.608
Ashley?

34:40.610 --> 34:41.909
Ashley!

34:41.911 --> 34:44.512
Hey, wake up.
It's just a dream.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.717
Ashley, wake up.

34:49.753 --> 34:51.789
- What was that?
- What was what?

34:54.925 --> 34:58.226
What did you see?

34:58.228 --> 35:01.362
Hey, Ashley? It's just us.
It's okay.

35:01.364 --> 35:03.664
Is he gone?
He... He hurt her.

35:03.666 --> 35:06.467
- Hurt who? What are you talking about?
- Elizabeth.

35:06.469 --> 35:07.769
Elizabeth...

35:07.771 --> 35:09.637
The woman that...
she brings me words.

35:09.639 --> 35:11.808
What's her problem?

35:39.402 --> 35:41.202
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

35:41.204 --> 35:43.537
- No, you shut up.
- No, there's somebody out there.

35:43.539 --> 35:46.508
- Orlonsky?
- No. Uh...

35:46.510 --> 35:50.512
- I don't know.
- It's him.

35:50.514 --> 35:53.581
The man who attacked
Elizabeth.

35:53.583 --> 35:56.887
- The man from my dream.
- Who is Elizabeth?

35:59.989 --> 36:01.956
- Uh, I'm going to bed.
- Veronica, don't.

36:01.958 --> 36:04.592
- Get off me.
- Veronica, don't!

36:04.594 --> 36:08.530
Touch me again, and I'll
choke the life out of you.

36:28.251 --> 36:29.853
Slumber party?

36:36.260 --> 36:38.793
Why choose us?

36:38.795 --> 36:42.333
- For what?
- To come here.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.700
Because we're screw-ups.

36:45.702 --> 36:48.436
So are a lot of girls.

36:48.438 --> 36:51.805
Maybe those other girls
didn't apply.

36:51.807 --> 36:54.642
- I didn't apply to Blackwood.
- You applied?

36:54.644 --> 36:57.882
- No, I guess I didn't.
- They found me.

36:59.382 --> 37:02.284
Dr. Sinclair showed up
at my therapist's office

37:02.286 --> 37:04.885
after I was accused
of setting my school on fire.

37:04.887 --> 37:07.688
- "Accused"?
- What did he look like?

37:07.690 --> 37:09.724
The man from your dream?

37:09.726 --> 37:12.427
- Scary.
- Really.

37:12.429 --> 37:14.561
Go to sleep. All of you.

37:14.563 --> 37:16.463
Should we tell
Madame Duret?

37:16.465 --> 37:19.066
What,
that Ashley had a nightmare?

37:19.068 --> 37:20.934
That Kit saw something
in the hallway.

37:20.936 --> 37:23.070
- I don't know what I saw.
- I told you.

37:23.072 --> 37:25.974
- It was that man-woman Orlonsky.
- Then why didn't you open the door?

37:25.976 --> 37:28.677
Because last time Orlonsky
nearly ripped her face off.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.577
That wasn't Orlonsky.

37:30.579 --> 37:34.516
I've seen something
like that before.

37:34.518 --> 37:37.452
- Some scary guy?
- No, he wasn't scary.

37:37.454 --> 37:39.753
He was my dad.

37:39.755 --> 37:43.426
Of course, about eight different
therapists tried to convince me otherwise.

37:45.061 --> 37:46.894
He came to me.

37:46.896 --> 37:50.333
It was the same night
he got into his accident.

37:51.568 --> 37:53.371
I think he wanted to...

37:56.572 --> 37:58.639
I don't know.

37:58.641 --> 38:01.444
Just wish I had the chance
to say something.

38:02.579 --> 38:04.548
Like what?

38:06.849 --> 38:10.017
- Goodbye.
- It was a dream.

38:10.019 --> 38:13.822
Ghosts aren't real,
even when you want them to be.

38:13.824 --> 38:17.391
Wow. Someone's
an insensitive douche.

38:17.393 --> 38:19.728
- She's telling the truth.
- How do you know that?

38:19.730 --> 38:22.463
- Because I've seen things too.
- Like what?

38:22.465 --> 38:24.532
Things.

38:24.534 --> 38:27.135
Things you can't explain.

38:27.137 --> 38:28.836
I bet you I can.

38:28.838 --> 38:32.106
- Since when?
- Since always.

38:32.108 --> 38:35.346
- Kind of. But it's more that I can...
- Feel them?

38:37.012 --> 38:40.414
I never knew what it was.

38:40.416 --> 38:42.883
This feeling, like...

38:42.885 --> 38:45.987
something was
always around me,

38:45.989 --> 38:48.757
following me.

38:48.759 --> 38:51.525
I never said anything,
and when I finally did, they...

38:51.527 --> 38:55.065
They said you needed friends.
Or pills.

38:56.632 --> 38:58.868
Or you needed
to be put away.

39:03.039 --> 39:05.443
Some gift we have.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.490
Madame Duret?

39:22.492 --> 39:24.825
Ah, Sierra.

39:24.827 --> 39:27.595
I was just looking
at your latest piece.

39:27.597 --> 39:30.565
Personally, I prefer
your more naturalistic efforts,

39:30.567 --> 39:33.133
but who am I to argue
with inspiration?

39:33.135 --> 39:35.537
- Thank you.
- Uh...

39:35.539 --> 39:37.671
- We wanted to ask you a question.
- Jules tells me

39:37.673 --> 39:40.108
you're making excellent
progress too, Kathryn.

39:40.110 --> 39:42.976
There was something
in the hallway last night.

39:42.978 --> 39:45.045
Maybe even
in Ashley's room.

39:45.047 --> 39:48.450
- And you saw this something?
- Yeah. Yeah, we did.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.552
I'm surprised
it took you this long.

39:50.554 --> 39:53.554
- Are you still taking your medications?
- Yeah.

39:53.556 --> 39:56.191
With powerful chemicals like that,
you're bound to have nightmares.

39:56.193 --> 39:59.994
- But we all saw it.
- I didn't see anything.

39:59.996 --> 40:02.764
Look at me, all of you.

40:02.766 --> 40:05.566
It's the state that prescribed
those drugs, not me.

40:05.568 --> 40:09.537
- They help sometimes.
- They dampen your creative spirit.

40:09.539 --> 40:12.206
You girls don't need
to be fixed.

40:12.208 --> 40:14.742
Damn anyone who
tells you differently.

40:14.744 --> 40:18.847
If it were up to some people, all
the greats would be labeled mad.

40:18.849 --> 40:21.081
The world would
still be flat,

40:21.083 --> 40:25.556
and powerful women like us
would be burned at the stake.

40:27.724 --> 40:29.891
A bit dramatic,
don't you agree?

40:29.893 --> 40:33.228
- As of now, no more pills.
- You can do that?

40:33.230 --> 40:35.630
I just did,

40:35.632 --> 40:39.700
provided that all of you in return
agree to redouble your efforts.

40:39.702 --> 40:41.769
Good.

40:41.771 --> 40:43.938
Hmm?

40:43.940 --> 40:45.775
Carry on.

42:33.248 --> 42:36.016
That was beautiful,
Kit.

42:36.018 --> 42:37.687
Oh.

42:39.054 --> 42:41.822
How do you know
that music?

42:41.824 --> 42:44.025
- Uh...
- Huh?

42:44.027 --> 42:48.762
I don't know. It's like
I've, um, heard it before.

42:48.764 --> 42:51.231
Like I was
remembering it.

42:51.233 --> 42:53.871
Remembering
William Kestler's music?

42:55.405 --> 42:58.805
Yeah.
I don't get it.

42:58.807 --> 43:00.941
I never got
nearly this good

43:00.943 --> 43:03.077
when I was taking lessons
before.

43:03.079 --> 43:04.912
I wish I could take
the credit.

43:04.914 --> 43:07.215
Of course it's because of you.
I mean, you studied

43:07.217 --> 43:09.717
at the Royal Academy of...

43:09.719 --> 43:12.320
I don't know,
wherever.

43:12.322 --> 43:13.887
You're a genius.

43:13.889 --> 43:16.858
I'm skilled
and disciplined,

43:16.860 --> 43:19.693
but as my mother
is fond of telling me,

43:19.695 --> 43:22.165
I am categorically
not a genius.

43:23.298 --> 43:25.201
Maybe she's wrong.

43:43.219 --> 43:45.987
- What I'm telling you is...
- Save your breath, Jules.

43:45.989 --> 43:48.889
I shouldn't have to remind you of the
importance of the role you play.

43:48.891 --> 43:51.224
We are their guides,
not their teachers.

43:51.226 --> 43:55.128
They have found a path. Our
function is to keep them on it.

43:55.130 --> 43:56.933
At any cost.

44:18.755 --> 44:21.925
I see your etiquette
has not improved, Veronica.

44:25.327 --> 44:28.295
Is Sierra sick?

44:28.297 --> 44:30.231
She hasn't been out
of her room in days.

44:30.233 --> 44:32.733
- She's been painting.
- When's the last time she ate?

44:32.735 --> 44:35.873
I think I have to go
back to my room too.

45:04.032 --> 45:08.806
- I believe this one is yours, yes?
- Yeah.

45:10.239 --> 45:12.874
Can I take it
in the hall?

45:12.876 --> 45:14.778
The charger.

45:27.222 --> 45:29.257
- Mom.
- <i>Honey, hi!</i>

45:29.259 --> 45:31.124
<i>Dave, it's Kit.</i>

45:31.126 --> 45:34.262
- <i>Sweetie, can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah.

45:34.264 --> 45:36.429
Yeah, I can hear you
just fine, Mom.

45:36.431 --> 45:40.001
<i>Sorry about the noise. How are you?
How is everything going?</i>

45:40.003 --> 45:42.436
- It's perfect.
- <i>Really?</i>

45:42.438 --> 45:45.505
Yeah.
That's the truth.

45:45.507 --> 45:47.809
<i>Are you okay, honey?</i>

45:47.811 --> 45:50.811
<i>He gave a thumbs-up.
His mouth is full.</i>

45:50.813 --> 45:53.113
<i>Kit, I wish that
we could speak more often.</i>

45:53.115 --> 45:56.349
- Me too.
- <i>So have you made any friends there?</i>

45:56.351 --> 45:58.452
Not really, Mom.
Thanks for asking.

45:58.454 --> 46:00.987
<i>Why? You're not getting
into trouble, are you?</i>

46:00.989 --> 46:02.590
No. No, I'm not.

46:02.592 --> 46:05.325
<i>But, you know,
you don't sound like yourself.</i>

46:05.327 --> 46:07.128
- I'm just...
- <i>Kit.</i>

46:08.931 --> 46:12.300
- <i>Honey, is everything okay?</i>
- Yeah.

46:12.302 --> 46:14.168
Yeah, I just miss you.

46:14.170 --> 46:17.003
<i>Oh, we miss you too, but...</i>

46:17.005 --> 46:20.407
- <i>Is something wrong? Because you sound weird.</i>
- No, no, everything's fine.

46:20.409 --> 46:24.144
<i>Honey, if something is wrong, let
us know, and we will come get you.</i>

46:24.146 --> 46:25.579
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

46:25.581 --> 46:27.981
Mom, I really got to go
to class now, okay?

46:27.983 --> 46:30.050
Okay, I love you, bye.

46:30.052 --> 46:31.521
May I be excused?

46:57.981 --> 46:59.516
Kit?

47:04.353 --> 47:06.989
It's the last poem
that I wrote.

47:13.128 --> 47:15.199
This is disgusting.

47:16.231 --> 47:17.430
Sorry.

47:17.432 --> 47:19.400
She's not coming anymore.

47:19.402 --> 47:22.036
- What are you talking about?
- She's not visiting me anymore.

47:22.038 --> 47:25.171
- Ashley, hey. Hey.
- There's someone new...

47:25.173 --> 47:26.507
who's taking over.

47:26.509 --> 47:31.412
- What?
- The men inside my head.

47:31.414 --> 47:33.947
- They're so angry.
- Listen to me.

47:33.949 --> 47:36.586
Hey, listen to me.
We're gonna be okay.

47:38.186 --> 47:40.324
We're gonna die here.

47:44.693 --> 47:47.061
Sierra?

47:47.063 --> 47:48.398
Sierra!

47:55.103 --> 47:56.639
Sierra?

48:22.965 --> 48:24.532
I'm... I'm...

48:24.534 --> 48:26.503
I'm so thirsty!

48:27.469 --> 48:29.538
Sierra, who's...

49:36.139 --> 49:38.041
Who's there?

49:44.447 --> 49:46.546
Boo!

49:46.548 --> 49:48.148
What are you
doing here?

49:48.150 --> 49:50.519
Thinking on setting
this place on fire.

49:53.489 --> 49:57.525
- That's more your thing, isn't it?
- Look at this.

49:57.527 --> 50:01.162
- Seriously, look.
- Why are Sierra's paintings in that book?

50:01.164 --> 50:03.296
That's just it.
They're Thomas Cole's.

50:03.298 --> 50:05.666
- Fabulous. Who is he?
- He was a painter.

50:05.668 --> 50:08.836
- He died in the 1800s. He was only 46.
- So...

50:08.838 --> 50:11.671
So Madame Duret has the exact
same landscape in her office,

50:11.673 --> 50:13.441
only it's from
a different angle.

50:13.443 --> 50:16.313
And Sierra is signing
her paintings "TC" too.

50:19.248 --> 50:23.184
Ashley said her words were coming
from someone named Elizabeth, right?

50:23.186 --> 50:27.655
And when Dr. Sinclair read Ashley's
poem in class, how did she describe it?

50:27.657 --> 50:29.222
She said it was
"incongruous".

50:29.224 --> 50:31.492
"Before her untimely death
at age 27,

50:31.494 --> 50:33.561
Elizabeth Webb's work
was considered the bridge

50:33.563 --> 50:36.463
between Romanticism
and Transcendental poetry,

50:36.465 --> 50:38.499
with echoes of Blake,
Byron and Keats.

50:38.501 --> 50:40.534
Webb's 'incongruous' stanzas

50:40.536 --> 50:43.104
and unusual preoccupation
with castles

50:43.106 --> 50:44.871
were likely what
led her contemporaries

50:44.873 --> 50:47.374
to secure a more lasting place
in history than she."

50:47.376 --> 50:51.177
And I am composing
Wilhelm Kestler music,

50:51.179 --> 50:52.815
for God's sake!

50:55.318 --> 50:57.418
I was wrong.

50:57.420 --> 50:59.655
All you bitches
aren't crazy.

51:01.590 --> 51:03.190
It's just you.

51:03.192 --> 51:04.825
Veronica, wait!

51:04.827 --> 51:06.226
Wait!

51:40.362 --> 51:42.331
Veronica?

51:49.338 --> 51:51.141
Veronica!

51:52.340 --> 51:53.643
Hey.

52:01.384 --> 52:02.853
Veronica?

52:17.500 --> 52:18.902
Veronica?

53:09.251 --> 53:11.420
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

53:56.298 --> 53:58.632
Help! Help!

54:09.644 --> 54:10.911
You saw them!

54:10.913 --> 54:12.916
You saw them, right?

54:14.516 --> 54:15.951
Not in here.

54:31.934 --> 54:34.804
I was never
worried about them.

54:36.472 --> 54:38.706
I saw things.

54:38.708 --> 54:40.106
Yes.

54:40.108 --> 54:42.578
Strange things. But...

54:43.746 --> 54:45.612
I refused to let it
matter to me.

54:45.614 --> 54:48.414
I had real problems
that mattered.

54:48.416 --> 54:51.818
When I was 13,
I went to the zoo

54:51.820 --> 54:54.021
to see the giraffes
with my friends, and...

54:54.023 --> 54:55.592
What?

54:57.525 --> 55:00.360
Giraffes are cool.

55:00.362 --> 55:04.430
When I came home,
my mom was screaming.

55:04.432 --> 55:06.900
My stepdad was beating
the living shit out of her.

55:06.902 --> 55:09.635
Don't make
the sympathy face.

55:09.637 --> 55:12.639
It happened
all the time.

55:12.641 --> 55:14.376
But this time...

55:15.577 --> 55:17.110
I grabbed a knife...

55:17.112 --> 55:22.682
just a small,
dull kitchen knife...

55:22.684 --> 55:24.554
and I stabbed him
in the chest.

55:26.989 --> 55:28.925
Did he die?

55:30.025 --> 55:33.594
But he never
touched her again.

55:33.596 --> 55:35.862
My mom thought
if she kept her head down,

55:35.864 --> 55:38.067
the beatings would
eventually stop.

55:40.402 --> 55:43.572
Bad things never stop
on their own, Kit.

55:50.512 --> 55:52.514
I think I know
where to start.

56:31.454 --> 56:33.623
I'm not going first.

57:08.023 --> 57:09.659
Beginner's luck.

57:29.043 --> 57:32.581
What... the hell?

57:35.650 --> 57:38.487
Let's go down.

57:39.855 --> 57:42.891
How big is
this freakin' place?

58:18.260 --> 58:21.128
Holy shit.

58:21.130 --> 58:22.765
Let's go.

59:33.668 --> 59:35.103
Shit.

59:53.755 --> 59:55.357
Beginner's luck.

01:00:43.371 --> 01:00:45.239
Shit, hide, hide!

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:50.976
Such a shame.

01:00:50.978 --> 01:00:54.081
We had such high hopes
for you, Veronica.

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:57.316
I have a habit of disappointing.
Kind of my thing.

01:00:57.318 --> 01:00:59.151
Hmm. Are you...

01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:01.487
alone on your little

01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:03.724
late-night
fact-finding mission?

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:06.295
I hate people.
You know that.

01:01:07.362 --> 01:01:09.032
I hate you.

01:01:15.403 --> 01:01:17.436
I have been
so patient with you,

01:01:17.438 --> 01:01:19.305
trying to make
something worthwhile

01:01:19.307 --> 01:01:22.041
out of something
so utterly worthless.

01:01:22.043 --> 01:01:25.412
Perhaps
I should have done more.

01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:27.914
Or perhaps with some people,
there's simply

01:01:27.916 --> 01:01:30.383
nothing more one can do.

01:01:30.385 --> 01:01:32.485
Rather than cooperate

01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:36.088
or appreciate what was offered
here at Blackwood,

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:38.492
you have made it
your mission

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:42.429
to squander every opportunity
I've given to you.

01:01:42.431 --> 01:01:45.434
So now, dear girl,

01:01:46.902 --> 01:01:48.869
I give you to them.

01:02:06.554 --> 01:02:08.554
Sierra!

01:02:08.556 --> 01:02:11.557
Sierra, wake up!
We have to go!

01:02:11.559 --> 01:02:13.092
Ashley!

01:02:13.094 --> 01:02:16.331
Ashley, let me in!
We have to go!

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.934
My baby.

01:04:34.936 --> 01:04:37.436
You promised me
I would see my baby.

01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:39.139
Be patient.

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:41.074
The connection
is getting stronger.

01:04:41.076 --> 01:04:43.175
She seems
rather awake.

01:04:43.177 --> 01:04:45.947
It doesn't matter.

01:05:16.644 --> 01:05:20.416
Don't be afraid, child.
Everyone is here for you.

01:05:26.221 --> 01:05:28.456
Just be a vessel
for the music.

01:06:14.735 --> 01:06:16.269
Play my music.

01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:17.670
Now.

01:06:17.672 --> 01:06:20.507
Not everyone
is a true artist.

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.108
Ignore him.

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:49.702
The door.

01:06:49.704 --> 01:06:52.171
I've never come this far.

01:06:52.173 --> 01:06:55.443
You're doing so well,
child.

01:07:00.548 --> 01:07:02.050
Dad.

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:29.612
It's my turn now!

01:07:31.146 --> 01:07:32.744
<i>Wake up again.</i>

01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:37.219
Why am I here?

01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:41.521
Why am I here?

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:43.755
- What's happening to me?
- Shh. Everything's okay.

01:07:43.757 --> 01:07:45.691
- Everything's...
- No.

01:07:45.693 --> 01:07:47.793
- Everything is okay.
- What are you people doing to me?

01:07:47.795 --> 01:07:49.896
- You came down to practice?
- No. No.

01:07:49.898 --> 01:07:51.764
- Where is Veronica?
- I don't know.

01:07:51.766 --> 01:07:55.702
- Stop lying!
- I don't know, Kit. I'm not lying.

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.670
All I know is, my mother is
dissatisfied with her progress.

01:07:57.672 --> 01:07:59.639
Are you recording this?

01:07:59.641 --> 01:08:01.907
Always make sure you get back
to your room safely, Kit, okay?

01:08:01.909 --> 01:08:03.876
But this way
we have the music.

01:08:03.878 --> 01:08:06.679
- For posterity, Kit.
- No, no! No!

01:08:06.681 --> 01:08:08.715
I trusted you!

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.483
You're giving the world
something beautiful here.

01:08:11.485 --> 01:08:14.487
Think of the music. Mozart and
Schubert, they died so young.

01:08:14.489 --> 01:08:18.290
William Kestler was 33
when he died. Can you imagine?

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:20.192
Think of the great artists
and the genius minds...

01:08:20.194 --> 01:08:21.760
No! Stop!

01:08:21.761 --> 01:08:24.330
- Kit, he had so much more to give.
- No!

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:26.465
- Kit, please.
- No!

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:28.268
They had their time.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.736
They are not
taking mine!

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:33.238
Get everyone
down here.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.675
Now!

01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:38.477
Why did you wake
all of us up?

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:41.813
Where is everyone?
Where is Veronica?

01:08:41.814 --> 01:08:45.285
- Veronica is no longer with us.
- You're a liar.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.352
You are all liars!

01:08:47.354 --> 01:08:49.721
- Mother, she needs to hear the truth.
- She won't understand.

01:08:49.724 --> 01:08:52.357
Oh, I understand,
all right.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:54.193
I was up in the attic.

01:08:54.194 --> 01:08:55.894
I saw all your files.

01:08:55.895 --> 01:08:59.432
I know what happened
to those other special girls.

01:08:59.434 --> 01:09:01.533
- Kit...
- You used them.

01:09:01.536 --> 01:09:04.571
You used them,
just like you're using us.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:08.273
- You should be grateful for the privilege.
- Grateful?

01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:10.375
- I'm grateful.
- Being possessed

01:09:10.377 --> 01:09:13.545
just to learn how to
play piano is a privilege?

01:09:13.546 --> 01:09:15.481
You stupid girl.
Don't you understand?

01:09:15.483 --> 01:09:17.683
You didn't learn anything.

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:19.419
You can't play
an instrument at all.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:23.956
You girls are
<i>their</i> instruments.

01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:25.758
We all have our gifts.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.294
Mine is to commune
with the other side.

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:32.999
Your gift, the gift
all you girls have,

01:09:33.001 --> 01:09:35.234
is that you are vessels.

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.669
Vessels for what?

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:39.238
Madame Duret helps
these men and women

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.674
to speak through you girls
to finish their work.

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:45.644
You could hardly play a scale
when you first arrived.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:48.615
Now you're composing
concertos.

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:49.982
Sierra couldn't
paint her nails.

01:09:49.984 --> 01:09:52.951
Now her work will
grace gallery walls.

01:09:52.953 --> 01:09:56.522
Ashley's poetry is on par with
some of the greatest ever written.

01:09:56.524 --> 01:09:59.358
And Izzy has nearly
figured out one of

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.861
the most elusive theorems
mathematics has ever known.

01:10:01.863 --> 01:10:05.498
And once she does, then what?
He claims he figured it out?

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.835
My dear, artists
since the dawn of time

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.969
have been searching
for this.

01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:14.941
The ultimate source
of inspiration. The muse.

01:10:14.943 --> 01:10:17.910
People have drugged themselves,
starved themselves,

01:10:17.912 --> 01:10:20.345
driven themselves mad with rage
and killed themselves

01:10:20.347 --> 01:10:22.815
when the muse
disappeared.

01:10:22.817 --> 01:10:26.451
Yeah, and you hang their paintings
in your lobby with pride.

01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:29.921
Or maybe
you sell them.

01:10:29.923 --> 01:10:33.026
This is not about
pride or money, child.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:35.394
This is about giving back
to the world

01:10:35.396 --> 01:10:38.330
the genius
physical death has stolen.

01:10:38.332 --> 01:10:41.701
And I have chosen you,

01:10:41.703 --> 01:10:44.070
plucked each of you
from obscurity,

01:10:44.072 --> 01:10:47.072
saving you from your
little lives of misery

01:10:47.074 --> 01:10:49.642
and delivered the muse
directly into your hands.

01:10:49.644 --> 01:10:53.780
Then get it out. Now!

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:56.816
Sometimes when the door
to the other side is opened,

01:10:56.818 --> 01:10:59.419
it's difficult to control
what comes in.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.853
- But we're here to help you.
- You people are crazy!

01:11:01.855 --> 01:11:03.856
- Kit...
- Stay back.

01:11:03.858 --> 01:11:05.625
All of you.

01:11:05.627 --> 01:11:08.027
Wouldn't you like to see
your father again, Kathryn?

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:10.629
Stay.

01:11:10.631 --> 01:11:13.066
Let us finish the work,

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:17.003
and your connection to him
will remain intact.

01:11:17.005 --> 01:11:20.406
Leave,
and he'll be gone.

01:11:20.408 --> 01:11:22.978
This time, forever.

01:11:24.746 --> 01:11:28.484
- Kit...
- Leave her, Jules. She can't go far.

01:11:29.884 --> 01:11:31.584
Wait for me, please.

01:11:31.586 --> 01:11:33.489
Kit, one second, please.

01:11:35.055 --> 01:11:38.023
Please, listen to me one second,
please. Kit...

01:11:38.025 --> 01:11:41.693
Get off me! Leave me alone!
Don't touch me!

01:11:45.399 --> 01:11:47.467
Don't hurt me!

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.634
- Ashley.
- Please, no!

01:11:51.972 --> 01:11:54.741
Get him off! Get him off me!

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:57.610
- Make him stop!
- Ashley?

01:11:57.612 --> 01:11:59.882
Ashley?

01:12:01.382 --> 01:12:04.483
No more.
I won't let you.

01:12:04.485 --> 01:12:07.853
- It's me, Kit.
- Stop. It needs to stop.

01:12:07.855 --> 01:12:10.455
It's me. We need to
get out, okay?

01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:12.525
- We can take care of this.
- Please?

01:12:12.527 --> 01:12:15.628
We need to get an ambulance!
What are you talking about?

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:18.563
Ashley, I'm gonna
be right back.

01:12:18.565 --> 01:12:21.670
- Kit, wait!
- Please, make it stop!

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:25.039
Kit, wait!

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:29.474
- For the office.
- Thank you.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.826
Ashley?

01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:48.160
No. No.

01:12:48.162 --> 01:12:50.963
- Ashley!
- Kit! Kit!

01:12:50.965 --> 01:12:52.400
Wait!

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:59.805
- Okay, let's go!
- Go!

01:12:59.807 --> 01:13:01.577
Hurry! Go!

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:31.903
Okay. Please work.
Please work.

01:13:31.905 --> 01:13:34.475
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:13:37.712 --> 01:13:40.916
Yes! Okay. Okay.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:57.796
Sierra. Sierra, wake up.
We have to go.

01:13:57.798 --> 01:13:58.930
Sierra.

01:13:58.932 --> 01:14:01.502
No!

01:14:03.938 --> 01:14:07.272
Izzy! Izzy! Izzy!

01:14:07.274 --> 01:14:10.545
Let me in! Open the door!
Open up! It's me!

01:14:20.154 --> 01:14:23.822
- We've got to go. Come on.
- They killed her.

01:14:23.824 --> 01:14:26.157
Sierra is dead.
And Ashley.

01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:30.062
- Let's go. We have to go.
- I think I've got it.

01:14:30.064 --> 01:14:32.865
- The answer is three, okay?
- How?

01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:35.567
Get out of here.
I'll find Veronica.

01:14:35.569 --> 01:14:37.171
Let's go!

01:14:40.608 --> 01:14:42.741
- It will be dealt with.
- We're all in danger.

01:14:42.743 --> 01:14:44.910
- Don't question me.
- It's out of control.

01:14:44.912 --> 01:14:48.113
- It's gone too far this time.
- It could go farther.

01:14:48.115 --> 01:14:50.148
The connection's the strongest
it's ever been.

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:52.151
I realize that,
but surely you can see...

01:14:52.153 --> 01:14:55.187
There's a price to pay
for what we seek.

01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:57.826
I'm in complete control.

01:15:00.228 --> 01:15:02.562
Let's not pretend

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:06.933
we're suddenly
unaccustomed to this.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:10.169
For these miscreants
to know brilliance,

01:15:10.171 --> 01:15:12.838
much less to be
in its possession,

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.107
it's worth the pitiful lives
they sacrifice.

01:15:15.109 --> 01:15:18.777
They are not vessels.

01:15:18.779 --> 01:15:20.278
They are donors.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.147
Cops are coming.

01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:24.219
What have you done?

01:15:26.119 --> 01:15:28.254
All of the work
I have done.

01:15:28.256 --> 01:15:30.690
How could you?
And you?

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:33.625
How could you betray me
like this? My own son?

01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:36.262
- Aah!
- Stay where you are!

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:39.197
I'll deal with the police
when they arrive. Take her away.

01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:42.067
- Jules!
- Let go! Let go of her!

01:15:43.938 --> 01:15:46.339
No! Jules!

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:50.643
Look what a pathetic thing
you've become.

01:15:50.645 --> 01:15:53.778
So weak.
Just like your father.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.618
But at least he had
the good sense to leave you.

01:16:00.121 --> 01:16:03.022
Stupid, stupid girl!

01:16:03.024 --> 01:16:05.257
Stupid!

01:16:05.259 --> 01:16:07.692
You don't have to
do this!

01:16:07.694 --> 01:16:09.361
Ungrateful girl.

01:16:09.363 --> 01:16:13.201
You are not the only one
who misses someone.

01:16:17.738 --> 01:16:19.638
No! Let me out!

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.941
Let me out! Please?

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.072
Veronica?

01:16:55.909 --> 01:16:58.210
Veronica, it's me.
It's Kit.

01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:11.225
What have they done
to you?

01:17:12.827 --> 01:17:14.195
Kit?

01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:27.173
You have to fight.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:30.878
That's what you're gifted.
You have to fight.

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:56.235
You know
this isn't right.

01:17:59.506 --> 01:18:01.473
Come on! Do it!

01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:04.078
You have to fight,
Veronica!

01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:10.452
Veronica,
you have to fight!

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:18.357
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

01:18:18.359 --> 01:18:20.992
Fight it! Fight!

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:23.995
Fight it! Fight!
Fight it, Veronica!

01:18:30.771 --> 01:18:33.475
Veronica. Veronica,
we got to hurry.

01:18:41.849 --> 01:18:44.950
Let us out! Please?

01:18:44.952 --> 01:18:47.122
Please, let us out!

01:18:48.823 --> 01:18:51.226
Kit? Is that you?

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.992
I need your help.

01:18:53.994 --> 01:18:56.064
It's just
too many numbers now.

01:19:04.171 --> 01:19:07.238
Give them a thousand each. If
that's not enough, give them more.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.176
What if they ask
to search the...

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.355
No.

01:19:24.358 --> 01:19:27.526
Izzy! Come on! We got to go!
We got to go, Izzy!

01:19:27.528 --> 01:19:30.295
- Izzy, no! Izzy! Come on!
- I belong here.

01:19:30.297 --> 01:19:32.531
Izzy, look at me.
You don't belong here.

01:19:32.533 --> 01:19:34.133
- It's so beautiful.
- Kit, come on!

01:19:34.135 --> 01:19:36.168
It's so beautiful.
Go, Kit. Go.

01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:39.338
You don't belong! Come on!

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.906
Kit, come on! This building
is going to collapse!

01:19:41.908 --> 01:19:43.811
We have to go now!

01:19:45.979 --> 01:19:49.250
- Izzy!
- Kit! Come on!

01:20:04.564 --> 01:20:06.397
No!

01:20:10.136 --> 01:20:11.937
- Kit.
- Are you okay?

01:20:11.939 --> 01:20:14.039
- Jules, are you okay?
- No.

01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:16.608
Come on. This way.

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:18.113
Come on!

01:20:32.592 --> 01:20:36.130
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:41.269
Go, go, go!

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:49.344
- What the hell?
- What's happening?

01:20:52.012 --> 01:20:53.480
Dad.

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.384
This way.

01:20:58.319 --> 01:21:01.019
Stop! Stop!

01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:02.489
Dad!

01:21:04.591 --> 01:21:07.058
- Guys, come on, come on! Guys!
- Kit!

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:09.361
Come on! Come on!

01:21:09.363 --> 01:21:12.868
Get out!
I'll be right behind you. Go!

01:21:25.578 --> 01:21:29.580
- There's no time for that.
- We must save what we can.

01:21:29.582 --> 01:21:32.186
Simone, listen to me.
It's over. Listen.

01:21:46.033 --> 01:21:48.067
Aah!

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.604
I'm in control!

01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:53.207
I am in control!

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.612
No, this way!
This way!

01:22:01.614 --> 01:22:05.019
I see him!
He's going in there!

01:23:05.445 --> 01:23:07.245
Anton!

01:23:07.247 --> 01:23:08.746
Anton!

01:23:08.748 --> 01:23:12.987
Anton!

01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:34.138
Go.

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.509
He's there.

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:50.722
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Kit, come on! What are you doing?

01:23:59.533 --> 01:24:01.236
Veronica, get out!

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:08.576
They're still inside!
They're still inside!

01:24:37.137 --> 01:24:38.669
Stop the car, Dave.

01:24:38.671 --> 01:24:40.674
Stop the car!

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:05.600
Jules, look at me. We've got to go.
We have to get out of here.

01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:08.536
Watch out!

01:25:11.538 --> 01:25:15.509
Jules, no!

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.877
Dad?

01:25:58.819 --> 01:26:02.257
Kit, darling,
you need to get up.

01:26:10.264 --> 01:26:12.330
<i>I'm so tired, Dad.</i>

01:26:12.332 --> 01:26:13.934
<i>I know.</i>

01:26:16.436 --> 01:26:19.804
<i>It's just too hard.</i>

01:26:19.806 --> 01:26:21.906
<i>It is.</i>

01:26:21.908 --> 01:26:23.875
<i>But you have to try.</i>

01:26:29.315 --> 01:26:31.519
<i>You started it,</i>

01:26:32.586 --> 01:26:34.521
<i>and you finished it.</i>

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:39.724
<i>If you trust me,</i>

01:26:39.726 --> 01:26:43.262
<i>and if you give all this
a chance, if you try...</i>

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:45.664
Honey! Honey!

01:26:45.666 --> 01:26:47.732
Watch her head.

01:26:47.734 --> 01:26:51.535
<i>You're meant
to do great things, Kathryn.</i>

01:26:51.537 --> 01:26:54.575
<i>You started
on a meaningful path.</i>

01:26:55.908 --> 01:26:59.346
<i>It's up to you
whether you finish or not.</i>

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:04.583
- Are you a relative?
- I'm her mother.

01:27:04.585 --> 01:27:05.916
Ginny! Ginny!

01:27:05.918 --> 01:27:08.687
- I'll follow you.
- Okay. Oh, baby.

01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:10.488
Let's go!

01:27:21.734 --> 01:27:23.735
<i>I'm lost, Dad.</i>

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:26.338
<i>I know.</i>

01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:29.340
<i>We all are.</i>

01:27:29.342 --> 01:27:32.813
I'm dying, aren't I?

01:27:38.051 --> 01:27:39.853
Yes.

01:27:43.957 --> 01:27:46.857
I've missed you
so much, Dad.

01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:49.393
I've missed you too,
Kit.

01:27:49.395 --> 01:27:51.062
I want to stay with you.

01:27:51.064 --> 01:27:54.268
You have
so much life ahead.

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:59.004
<i>This is the beginning.</i>

01:27:59.006 --> 01:28:00.742
You'll find a way.

01:28:07.347 --> 01:28:09.317
I have to go now.

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:13.688
Will I ever
see you again?

01:28:17.824 --> 01:28:19.894
I love you
so much, Kit.

01:28:20.927 --> 01:28:22.963
I love you too, Dad.

01:28:25.631 --> 01:28:27.534
Goodbye.

01:28:35.042 --> 01:28:37.642
I got a pulse.
I got a pulse, I got a pulse!

01:28:37.644 --> 01:28:41.112
What...

01:28:41.114 --> 01:28:43.749
Hello, baby.

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:45.887
Oh, hey!

01:28:49.021 --> 01:28:50.688
I love you so much.

01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:52.793
It's okay.
