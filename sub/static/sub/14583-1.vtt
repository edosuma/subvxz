01:40.720 --> 01:42.165
My Lady!

01:43.320 --> 01:44.560
My Lady!

01:46.720 --> 01:51.203
The Crown Prince has set out for
the King's palace with his sword.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.761
I fear for King's safety.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.203
If we don't stop him now,

02:00.400 --> 02:03.290
he's going to bring down
the Royal Grandson with him.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.485

<i>THE FIRST DAY</i>

02:44.800 --> 02:47.040
The only reason I'm informing you
of last night's events,

02:49.600 --> 02:52.490
although I'm the birth mother
of the Crown Prince

02:55.320 --> 02:58.767
is to protect you, Your Majesty.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.322
My Lady,

03:04.760 --> 03:06.683
you are a faithful retainer.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.322
Truly faithful.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.842
You're the only one I can trust.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.604
Even so

03:18.880 --> 03:22.282
his illness is to blame
for this disaster.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.291
If you must punish him,
please show him mercy

03:27.600 --> 03:30.001
and spare the Royal Grandson,
the Grand Heir.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.362
Your Majesty!
I beseech you to stop.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.285
This is by the request

04:03.320 --> 04:05.766
of the Crown Prince's own mother.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.520
Why do you intend to shake
the stability of this country

04:08.960 --> 04:11.770
based on words of
a mere concubine?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.331
Halt!

04:19.680 --> 04:21.363
Which gate does Your Majesty
wish to take?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.364
Gyeonghwa Gate.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.604
To Gyeonghwa Gate.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.324
The King summons you, Your Highness.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.331
Which gate did His Majesty use?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.091
Gyeonghwa Gate, Your Highness.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.401
Shall I take the Royal Grandson
with me?

05:10.600 --> 05:13.126
You choose your son
over your husband.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.046
My Lady,

05:27.840 --> 05:30.969
you are a cold, heartless woman.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.763
Take off your hat and
dragon robe.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.566
Son!

05:53.120 --> 05:54.565
No, my son...

06:25.960 --> 06:27.041
You...

06:27.880 --> 06:30.963
I see you really intend to kill me
already dressed for a funeral.

06:31.560 --> 06:36.441
I've been wearing them since the passing of
the Queen and the Queen Dowager.

06:36.442 --> 06:39.649
Even after the three-year
mourning period has long ended?

06:42.480 --> 06:43.606
Bring them out.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.851
What are all these?

07:01.440 --> 07:02.885
Did you not dig a grave

07:03.680 --> 07:08.527
in the palace garden, made caskets
and have been wearing mourning clothes,

07:09.120 --> 07:11.441
to curse me to death!

07:12.040 --> 07:15.726
You've been treating me
like a dead man.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.084
So I made myself a tomb.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.003
And last night...?

07:39.880 --> 07:41.723
I won't speak further of it.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.131
Repent by taking your own life.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.725
If I die, this kingdom will fall

07:54.720 --> 07:57.644
but if you die, the 300-year
Yi dynasty will be saved.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.961
Is 'suicide' a punishment
in the laws of this country?

08:03.520 --> 08:06.251
If I am guilty of a crime,
hand me over to the court.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.285
This is a family matter,
not a national affair.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.082
I am here as the head of a family,

08:13.240 --> 08:16.164
passing judgment upon a son
who conspired to kill his father.

08:17.160 --> 08:22.166
If you atone by death now, you will
not lose your title as Crown Prince.

08:22.920 --> 08:27.801
When did you ever regard me as
Crown Prince? Or as your son?

08:30.320 --> 08:34.119
What would become of us
if the Crown Prince dies?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.566
All those who served him
will go down with him.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.764
Not just us but our entire
clan will be wiped out.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.686
This is no time to worry
about your own safety

08:43.120 --> 08:45.122
when the fate of this kingdom
is at stake.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.609
Your Highness!

08:50.880 --> 08:54.168
- We beg you to stop.
- Withdraw the sword.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.330
- Your Highness!
- No!

08:57.880 --> 09:00.087
Mother, aren't we going to
help Father?

09:03.800 --> 09:06.246
- Leave me!
- We beg Your Highness to withdraw your sword.

09:06.247 --> 09:09.562
Let go of me.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.767
We beg you, sir.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.124
No, Your Highness!

09:21.680 --> 09:26.686
Your Majesty! Kill us first.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.366
Please kill us first.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.367
Your Majesty,

09:41.160 --> 09:45.639
even a king cannot impose
a punishment that is not

09:45.640 --> 09:49.850
in the Great Ming Code
or in any books of law.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.084
Please, sir.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.805
Remove them from my sight.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.166
Your majesty!

10:03.960 --> 10:05.689
Your Highness!

10:06.400 --> 10:07.811
Your majesty!

10:09.640 --> 10:11.879
We beg you to take heed.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.360
Please, Your Majesty!

10:25.400 --> 10:28.768
Rice chest... Bring out the rice chest.

10:44.640 --> 10:45.971
Put him inside.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.285
Don't touch me.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.245
I command you to let go.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.926
Seal it with nails.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.006
Son, no!

11:51.160 --> 11:53.288
Father, come out of there.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.522
Take the Grand Heir away.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.930
Your Majesty,
please spare my Father.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.327
I beg of you.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.922
Didn't I command to let no one in?

12:12.240 --> 12:14.527
Do you want the Grand Heir
locked up, too?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.368
I'll do whatever he couldn't,
Your Majesty.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.083
If you want him to study,
I will instead.

12:22.120 --> 12:26.279
I'll do whatever you wish.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.011
Spare my father's life.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.442
Take him away.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.802
Father, come out of there.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.159
Father!

12:39.160 --> 12:43.051
Father, come out of there.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.568
Father.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.445
Luxury...

13:08.360 --> 13:12.206
What is a luxury and what is not?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.601
This silk is a luxury.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.203
And this cotton is not.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.210
Who will you give that writing to?

13:32.080 --> 13:34.879
I shall hold it dear until the day I die.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.851
I shall preserve it as a family treasure.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.606
Your Highness,

13:42.360 --> 13:46.524
I give you all my remaining life.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.443
Long live, Your Highness.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.051
Alright.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.162
Even the way you eat pleases me.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.603
What are you reading these days?

14:09.840 --> 14:14.209
The Book of Filial Piety,
Your Majesty the Queen.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.399
What does it say about filial duties?

14:17.400 --> 14:22.159
That it represents a man

14:22.160 --> 14:26.609
carrying his old parent
on his back, Mother.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.685
Who will you carry on your back?

14:36.120 --> 14:40.682
My precious baby!

14:40.920 --> 14:44.322
It is time for your studies,
Your Highness.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.365
Oh, my head hurts!

14:49.640 --> 14:51.404
Go on, my clear.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.679
“He who loves his parents
does no evil unto others.”

14:55.680 --> 14:59.651
“He who loves his parents
does no evil unto others...”

15:00.320 --> 15:05.167
“He who respects his parents
dare not be arrogant.”

15:17.560 --> 15:21.087
Your Highness, how can you be dozing off?

15:23.000 --> 15:27.164
If you understood the true meaning of filial
piety, you could not be falling asleep.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.319
You will be tested by
the King in two clays.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.209
Please take heed.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.324
Your filial duty as the prince is to study.

16:20.640 --> 16:25.202
Can I sleep with mama?

16:25.640 --> 16:29.247
A Crown Prince must sleep
on his own.

16:38.080 --> 16:45.248
Can't he stay with me, just tonight?

16:45.440 --> 16:49.445
It's against court rules.

16:49.640 --> 16:56.285
His Highness is not your son,
but the Queen's now.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.724
Your Majesty, it is past your bedtime.

17:11.319 --> 17:16.041
As a father transcribing a book for
his son, how could I go to sleep?

17:29.320 --> 17:33.689
<i>THE SECOND DAY</i>

17:42.160 --> 17:43.366
As Your Majesty commanded,

17:43.720 --> 17:47.406
we've captured all those involved with
the Crown Prince in his misconducts.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.643
Royal Secretary,

17:50.720 --> 17:54.247
issue a decree that demotes
Crown Prince to a commoner.

17:55.400 --> 18:00.167
I'm a servant to this kingdom.

18:00.720 --> 18:04.850
Please give me a justification
to honor your wishes.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.360
Is that right?

18:09.120 --> 18:10.645
Then, Chief Secretary, you write it.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.884
I can't do it either, Sire.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.685
How embarrassing for the King.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.689
Bring out the ink and paper.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.207
Can't he sentence the Prince
to drink poison?

18:34.160 --> 18:38.404
If he bestows poison,
it makes the Crown Prince a traitor.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.729
If the Prince be a traitor,
his father is also a traitor.

18:44.200 --> 18:49.764
That is the law of this country
which follows the laws of Ming China.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.721
The Crown Prince was born
with many fine talents.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.162
He brought me great joy
and I loved him deeply.

19:12.163 --> 19:14.925
But since the age of ten,
he began to neglect his studies

19:15.720 --> 19:18.610
and after assuming the regency,
developed a serious illness

19:18.640 --> 19:21.530
that turned him into an obscene
and wicked character.

19:22.800 --> 19:29.251
When the illness deteriorated he lost
his reason and even murdered a eunuch.

19:29.400 --> 19:34.611
He associated with shamans, Buddhist nuns
and courtesans day and night,

19:35.440 --> 19:40.287
and abandoned his duties to the King.

19:40.600 --> 19:45.606
Moreover, he built a tomb
in the palace garden,

19:45.960 --> 19:49.442
and conspired to carry
out an unspeakable act.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.529
Hence, Consort Yi, the birth mother
of the Crown Prince informed me

19:57.000 --> 20:03.963
that my life is at stake
and requested to make a decision.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.848
Thereupon, I depose the Crown Prince

20:14.440 --> 20:16.681
and order that he be
locked up as a commoner.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.442
I am blessed with such
a beautiful daughter-in-law!

20:36.960 --> 20:40.567
Since I received your formal greetings
today, I shall give a word of advice.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.764
Serve your husband with utmost devotion.

20:43.765 --> 20:46.491
Never let your voice or
your face be frivolous.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.839
Whatever happens in court
shall be deemed normal.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.604
So do not show any signs
of acknowledgement.

20:54.800 --> 20:58.009
A wife shall not greet her husband
in undergarments.

20:58.360 --> 21:02.001
Always maintain the proper attire
in front of the Crown Prince.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.679
However pretty your make-up is,

21:06.680 --> 21:11.368
lipstick mark on your husband's attire is
not pretty. Take care not to...

21:11.369 --> 21:12.600
Why do you laugh?

21:36.520 --> 21:37.806
How dare you!

21:38.080 --> 21:42.399
How can a princess born from a concubine

21:42.400 --> 21:44.721
sit alongside the future queen?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.887
Behave with due courtesy.

21:57.720 --> 22:02.567
There're things you must remember
when serving the King.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.411
I'm the Queen only by title.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.806
Lady Yi should tell her as one
who served the King closer.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.924
His Majesty takes care
to avoid using certain words.

22:27.040 --> 22:32.126
He shuns ominous characters such as 'death'
so, never uses them.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.128
After finishing his royal duties
for the clay...

22:37.760 --> 22:39.762
he always gets changed
before entering his chamber.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.004
If he has heard ominous words,

22:45.480 --> 22:48.165
he rinses out his mouth and
washes his ears before bed.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.848
Then, he summons someone he disfavors
and says a word to him,

22:52.849 --> 22:53.959
Everything well?

22:53.960 --> 22:55.450
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Leave me now.

22:55.451 --> 22:58.649
As to get rid of bad luck.

23:00.960 --> 23:05.966
He uses different gates
for pleasant and unpleasant matters.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.444
For pleasant, he takes Manan Gate,

23:10.200 --> 23:13.886
but for the unpleasant,
he takes the Gyeonghwa Gate.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.566
Also,

23:19.640 --> 23:22.120
he never lets those he loves

23:22.960 --> 23:27.966
be in the same place as
those he disfavors.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.040
As such, the King is unfathomably blatant
in how he expresses

23:34.440 --> 23:37.683
his love and resentment.

23:39.640 --> 23:45.443
You, Crown Princess shall tread carefully
to avoid falling out of favor.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.727
So whimsical...

23:53.520 --> 23:55.045
Your Highness,

23:55.640 --> 23:58.689
take heed not to upset
the elders of the royal court.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.451
Always tread carefully then,
even more carefully.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.444
Father,

24:04.680 --> 24:06.603
Mother...

24:07.960 --> 24:12.170
Your Highness,
don't cry on such a joyous clay.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.200
Let her cry.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.604
Grow, Magical Staff!

24:25.800 --> 24:29.600
People envy us for
becoming the King's in-laws

24:30.040 --> 24:34.568
but we should be on guard
to protect our clan.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.800
Your Highness.

24:43.760 --> 24:47.526
Qing Emperor has sent this puppy
as your wedding gift.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.161
What is your name?

24:57.640 --> 25:00.291
Do you know how great Father is?

25:01.120 --> 25:03.600
He surpasses any courtiers even in studies.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.967
Do not fear him though.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.923
You have me to rely on.

25:11.320 --> 25:14.802
You have passed Father's test.
I can guarantee.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.326
Yes, my Lord.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.762
Keep still, Mong.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.044
My Lady, can you hold him still?

25:28.760 --> 25:32.606
I am blessed with such a beautiful wife!

25:33.600 --> 25:37.730
Always serve your husband with a smile.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.204
It's time to study, Your Highness.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.639
“The path cannot be diverted at any time.“

26:08.640 --> 26:11.849
“If it can be diverted,
it is not the path.“

26:16.360 --> 26:18.886
“Nothing is more visible than the hidden

26:19.000 --> 26:21.651
and nothing is more apparent
than the subtle.“

26:21.880 --> 26:26.647
“Therefore, a man of integrity
is cautious even more when alone.“

26:30.640 --> 26:31.846
Pass.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.649
Pass? Did you say pass?

26:35.640 --> 26:38.005
“A man of integrity is cautious even
at a place where he is not seen,

26:38.006 --> 26:39.886
and is apprehensive
even where he is not heard.“

26:40.080 --> 26:43.971
He skipped a whole phrase, not a word.
Yet, you say pass?

26:45.800 --> 26:49.009
He is the future King and
the root of the kingdom.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.644
How can you act this way
unless you wish to ruin this country?

26:53.880 --> 26:59.011
This is a book I stayed up all night
to transcribe for your studies.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.171
If you can't even memorize this,
what could you possibly learn?

27:04.720 --> 27:09.169
How many times in a year
do you think about studying?

27:09.320 --> 27:10.810
Once or twice, Sire.

27:11.720 --> 27:12.721
What?

27:13.360 --> 27:17.365
Sir, how can you specifically say
once or twice?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.809
Your Highness is too modest.

27:19.840 --> 27:24.243
Teacher, I know my own heart.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.167
Is that so?

27:29.880 --> 27:32.167
Good for being so honest!

27:32.920 --> 27:34.649
When I was your age,

27:35.080 --> 27:38.004
I was afraid that something may
hinder my studies.

27:38.005 --> 27:43.006
But you, in this fortunate condition,
neglect your studies.

27:43.400 --> 27:47.999
The Crown Prince is not very
fond of strict books of codes,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.082
- but novels like 'Journey to the West'...
- What?

27:51.000 --> 27:54.082
You're letting the Crown Prince
read such rubbish?

27:54.083 --> 27:57.364
Your Majesty, I beg you to watch him
with patience and affection

27:57.365 --> 27:59.442
for he has excellent disposition...

27:59.443 --> 28:02.808
How can you say that
looking at his tanned face

28:03.320 --> 28:06.164
from playing outside all day!

28:07.160 --> 28:09.162
Playing is a pleasure of a moment,

28:09.163 --> 28:12.164
but learning offers a
pleasure of a lifetime.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.369
You have nothing to say
but to stare at me?

28:30.280 --> 28:32.965
<i>THE THIRD DAY</i>

29:10.320 --> 29:11.839
Open Up!

29:11.840 --> 29:14.759
Open this gate at once!

29:14.760 --> 29:16.959
Open it.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.530
Open the gate.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.363
Open the gate.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.566
Open the gate.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.361
Open it.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.286
Open it.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.364
Open the gate.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.607
Open it.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.600
Open.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.368
Your Highness. You can't do this.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.279
I'd rather take the poison!

30:50.280 --> 30:51.441
Your Highness!

30:52.000 --> 30:55.209
- Sir!
- Please!

30:56.120 --> 30:59.647
This could get the Royal Grandson killed.

30:59.840 --> 31:03.639
Let him murder his own son. His
grandson, too! Let him kill everyone!

31:03.640 --> 31:05.290
Your Highness...

31:07.640 --> 31:08.641
Your Highness...

31:10.200 --> 31:14.524
Kill us all! Let him reign for
thousands of years all by himself.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.965
Lock him up again.

31:25.160 --> 31:29.688
Let go of me.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.199
Why is it all my fault?

31:32.200 --> 31:35.639
Think about what you did to me.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.120
You have no right to say that.

31:38.680 --> 31:43.004
If you're so blameless...
Then, kill me now!

31:43.360 --> 31:44.519
Shut the lid.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.526
This is not the conduct of a king.
This is not the conduct of a king!

31:53.000 --> 31:56.322
Your Highness, you must
think of the future.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.161
Bind the chest.

32:17.720 --> 32:18.721
Put moss over it.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.961
<i>In regular homes, parents raise
their children with love.</i>

32:36.360 --> 32:41.605
But in the royal household,
they regard their children as enemies.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.089
Why do you think that is?

32:47.200 --> 32:51.444
How can a father's love
for his child be different?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.051
It is different.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.764
Every time I visit the Shrines,

33:00.720 --> 33:03.485
I hear the bloody cries of my forefathers.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.159
This here

33:14.160 --> 33:20.406
is the shrine of my father, Sukjong
the Great who reigned for 46 years.

33:22.240 --> 33:27.201
This king bestowed poison upon his wife.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.485
And this is the shrine of my older brother,
Gyeongjong the Great.

33:43.720 --> 33:48.408
People say that I killed him
to steal the throne.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.202
What do you think?

33:54.240 --> 33:59.246
I'm sure it's nothing more than a malicious
rumor created by your opposition.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.289
Pay no heed, Sire.

34:04.560 --> 34:09.279
There are kings who have killed their own
brothers and nephews

34:09.280 --> 34:11.806
to preserve the dynasty.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.400
To regard children as enemies
in a royal household...

34:22.840 --> 34:24.569
Can you understand now?

34:31.560 --> 34:33.847
You will when you become King.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.804
<i>No, Your Majesty!</i>

34:43.360 --> 34:46.648
How can you command us
something we cannot accept?

34:48.840 --> 34:52.889
I have waited 25 years for this clay.

34:54.120 --> 34:58.887
Now that Crown Prince has come of age,
it's time for me to hand over the throne.

35:00.680 --> 35:03.159
Stop the King at once.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.208
He is not speaking from his heart again.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.679
The Crown Prince still has more to learn.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.401
Why do you interrupt his studies
by giving him duties as king?

35:13.402 --> 35:17.883
I never cared for the throne.

35:18.240 --> 35:22.928
As you all know, I only held
the position temporarily

35:23.440 --> 35:24.930
since my brother had no heir.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.363
Indeed, we know Your Majesty's
genuine intentions.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.931
Let us assist you with even greater effort.

35:32.920 --> 35:37.482
Your Majesty, please
revoke your royal decree.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.487
We beg of you, Your Majesty!

35:48.840 --> 35:52.925
If so, what if I make
the Crown Prince regent?

35:58.560 --> 35:59.925
Is that also unacceptable?

36:02.760 --> 36:06.970
Creation of the Hangul alphabet and
expansion of northern territories are

36:06.971 --> 36:09.247
known feats of Sejong the Great.

36:09.400 --> 36:15.248
But these were achieved
during his son Munjong's regency.

36:15.760 --> 36:20.288
That is why they say
that regency ruling has no real reward.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.930
My Teachers,

36:23.480 --> 36:27.769
the regency is for Father, not me.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.765
You need not worry.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.802
Do this right. People always judge
the father with his son's work.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.641
If we reduce the military tax

36:54.640 --> 36:57.962
from two rolls of textile to one,
as Your Highness commands,

36:58.600 --> 37:01.490
the defense budget will be
short by 800,000 nyang.

37:01.491 --> 37:05.690
What is your solution,
Defense Minister?

37:06.240 --> 37:11.406
If we have each province contribute
120,000 nyang from their reserve funds

37:12.680 --> 37:18.369
and impose penalty on those avoiding
military duties for additional 50,000 nyang,

37:18.880 --> 37:23.249
170,000 nyang in total
can be collected.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.489
Ancl for the remaining 630,000 nyang?

37:33.320 --> 37:37.959
From 800,000 tracts of land
owned by the nobles,

37:37.960 --> 37:40.930
we can impose a land tax of
1 nyang for every 2 tracts...

37:40.931 --> 37:42.410
Your Highness!

37:43.680 --> 37:46.843
By law, the nobles are exempt
from military duty.

37:46.920 --> 37:50.599
You always claim that
this is a land of noblemen.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.082
Yet, you leave the duty of
defense to starving commoners?

38:00.080 --> 38:02.651
The royal household shall set an example

38:03.080 --> 38:08.769
by paying 100,000 nyang as tax
from its fisheries, salt ponds and ships.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.327
The remaining 130,000 nyang

38:18.080 --> 38:23.086
shall be saved by uniting five armies
for efficiency.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.880
- What do you think?
- Your Highness...

38:26.400 --> 38:30.405
You cannot interfere with
the military control.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.370
Why is that?

38:33.360 --> 38:37.888
His Majesty the King gave us a pledge
when he ascended the throne.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.002
So their faction took the advantage and

38:40.360 --> 38:43.489
had complete control of
the military for past 25 years.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.525
- Corruption getting beyond control.
- How dare you!

38:46.560 --> 38:48.847
Enough!

38:49.120 --> 38:54.126
Your Highness, the indictment of a faction
monopolizing military control

38:54.320 --> 38:56.607
must be uprooted.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.329
How can segregation be tolerated
even within the military?

39:00.330 --> 39:02.919
Your Highness, it is not segregation.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.079
He's talking about mere social groups.

39:06.080 --> 39:09.448
Is Joseon's army a place
for your socializing?

39:09.720 --> 39:13.042
How can there be segregation
in King's royal army?

39:19.560 --> 39:23.599
As of today, all factional segregation
in all five armies

39:23.600 --> 39:26.119
shall be abolished and reformed.

39:26.120 --> 39:32.651
I order you to unify the command system
into one between His Majesty and armies.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.807
A fair and square decision, Sire.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.610
A fair and square decision, Sire.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.804
Those who have relished control of
the military as a reward for

39:52.805 --> 39:54.484
having helped the King seize the throne,

39:54.560 --> 39:56.642
finally met their match.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.643
You must be so proud
of your husband.

39:59.880 --> 40:06.604
For appearance or character,
our Crown Prince surpasses the King.

40:08.640 --> 40:13.441
We've been expecting,
so we can accept military taxes.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.491
- However...
- I hear you.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.686
Military control is a matter of loyalty
between us, Sire.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.045
Enough!

40:47.960 --> 40:49.962
Mind your attire.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.531
Not quite like the way
you handled state affairs.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.170
Tie your hem again.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.564
Did you have fun making
your whimsical decisions?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.045
That is your problem.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.249
Why divide the court into
your side and mine?

41:15.720 --> 41:19.039
As your son, I wanted to restore military
control back into your hands...

41:19.040 --> 41:21.280
You think I left things as
they are because I'm ignorant?

41:22.920 --> 41:25.124
My policy of 'Magnificent Harmony'...

41:25.125 --> 41:28.249
You rendered my life's work
worthless in just one clay.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.966
The throne is not a place
for making decisions.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.531
It's a place to moderate decisions
and ask who's responsible.

41:40.920 --> 41:44.288
This is a petition by
the Governor of Hamgyeong.

41:44.920 --> 41:50.086
For relocation of the defense camp
in Seogjin back to Gilju.

41:50.600 --> 41:55.079
Gilju can block all nine routes
leading to six fortresses

41:55.080 --> 41:58.323
whereas Seongjin can block
only three routes.

41:59.080 --> 42:04.120
If we move the defense camp back to Gilju,
how can we defend Seongjin?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.129
We can leave a reserve of soldiers.

42:08.240 --> 42:12.165
Then, it would be advisable
to move the camp back to Gilju.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.322
Ministry of Military, discuss
details and execute.

42:17.800 --> 42:21.725
- As Your Highness commands.
- Wait, wait.

42:23.120 --> 42:29.810
My decision to move the defense camp
to Seongjin was made for a reason.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.084
If you overturn that decision,
where does that leave me?

42:37.920 --> 42:41.003
You all trying to undermine me
behind the Prince regent?

42:42.680 --> 42:43.841
Huh?

42:47.360 --> 42:49.362
What do you know about
national defense?

42:51.040 --> 42:52.326
Ever been to the northern state?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.682
Leave the defense camp as it is

42:56.683 --> 42:59.889
and consult with me first
on all major decisions from now.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.086
Next.

43:04.080 --> 43:09.086
Your Highness, Ministry of Defense borrowed
silver from the central army,

43:09.720 --> 43:13.361
while central army is due to pay us
300 bags of rice as tax.

43:13.362 --> 43:17.639
But central army is refusing to pay

43:17.640 --> 43:19.847
in exchange of the silver
we must repay.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.999
Your Highness, the Defense Minister's
claim is one-sided.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.359
He's not returning the silver we had
for emergencies

43:29.360 --> 43:32.804
yet, demands the rice as tax.
That is totally absurd.

43:32.805 --> 43:34.642
How dare can they call it even

43:34.643 --> 43:40.204
with the temporary loan of silver we used for
the Qing's envoy and the tax to our country?

43:40.600 --> 43:44.241
Your Highness, please settle this matter.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.003
What... should I do, Sire?

43:52.440 --> 43:57.082
You trouble me over
such trivial matter?

43:58.080 --> 44:00.287
Making you regent was futile.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.323
Order the central army
to send the rice,

44:04.324 --> 44:07.164
and the Defense Ministry to repay
the silver. What else?

44:12.160 --> 44:13.810
As His Majesty commands.

44:15.080 --> 44:16.241
Next.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.600
A petition from the Governor of
the southern state, Your Highness.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.919
They haven't had any rain
in four months

44:24.920 --> 44:27.400
so their crops are all ruined.

44:28.240 --> 44:31.403
Your Highness, what should we do?

44:31.920 --> 44:34.764
The heavens didn't give rain
due to my lack of virtue as King.

44:34.765 --> 44:37.081
Why ask the Prince?

44:40.880 --> 44:42.041
That is not true.

44:42.800 --> 44:45.483
It hasn't rained since
I assumed regency.

44:45.484 --> 44:48.370
It's all due to my lack of virtue
as the Crown Prince!

44:56.440 --> 45:02.163
Your Highness, let's go to the interrogation
hall where His Majesty presides.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.764
You must attend the interrogation.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.490
My Lord,

45:10.320 --> 45:12.800
is this how regency ruling is?

45:14.280 --> 45:15.964
You must endure it, Your Highness.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.166
I don't want to.

45:27.440 --> 45:28.805
Your Highness...

45:29.720 --> 45:31.365
Is the policy of Magnificent Harmony

45:31.366 --> 45:34.364
all about being conscious of
high officials?

45:39.440 --> 45:44.002
How can I serve a King
who murdered his own brother?

45:44.840 --> 45:47.002
Still babbling about that?

45:49.440 --> 45:54.446
The rumor was judged groundless
when I ascended the throne.

45:57.160 --> 46:01.051
If that is true,
why did Yi In-jwa rise in revolt?

46:01.200 --> 46:04.363
Isn't it because he couldn't
acknowledge you as King?

46:05.880 --> 46:07.564
Rip out his mouth!

46:08.880 --> 46:13.886
Killing one man will not change
the way of this world.

46:14.040 --> 46:20.047
How can a son of a lowly court slave
succeed Sukjong the Great?

46:20.800 --> 46:24.009
It's not just people from Naju
who think this

46:24.560 --> 46:28.360
but everyone in the south does.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.125
Rip out his mouth, too.

46:40.400 --> 46:45.361
You may be the king of clogs
in Qing China. But this is Joseon.

46:46.840 --> 46:50.890
If you keep barking,
I will mate you with a mutt.

47:00.040 --> 47:01.280
Your Highness,

47:02.000 --> 47:03.843
the King seeks you.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.921
Such abominable bastards!

47:11.360 --> 47:14.443
I have heard more horrendous
curses than I can bear.

47:25.520 --> 47:28.603
- Is everything well?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.601
Why didn't you come
to the interrogation?

47:32.360 --> 47:33.600
Did you study?

47:34.440 --> 47:38.843
When your father works so hard clay and
night... Ancl you call yourself my son.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.441
Get out.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.366
Yes, Sire.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.360
You...

48:28.160 --> 48:31.209
Did you write a poem to
Yi Eui-gyeong for his journey

48:31.560 --> 48:35.007
that says that reading
is your greatest pleasure?

48:36.480 --> 48:37.686
Yes, Your Majesty.

48:38.480 --> 48:42.166
How can reading be
your greatest pleasure?

48:42.920 --> 48:45.519
Not only did you deceive him,

48:45.520 --> 48:50.731
but you deceived everyone in that region
who will read your poem and praise you.

48:52.640 --> 48:55.211
It's because of your lies

48:55.920 --> 48:59.129
that this rain they need
in their drought-ridden region

48:59.480 --> 49:01.926
is pouring down here on our
sacred visit to the royal tomb!

49:03.200 --> 49:07.330
Don't you ever pretend to be honest.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.529
You're unworthy of paying
respects to my father's tomb.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.360
Return to the palace!

49:15.320 --> 49:17.527
If only I had another son...

49:19.160 --> 49:20.321
Move it!

49:39.040 --> 49:42.044
<i>THE FOURTH DAY</i>

49:42.640 --> 49:43.721
Water...

49:44.280 --> 49:46.044
Bring water.

49:46.720 --> 49:49.644
Bring water.

49:49.760 --> 49:52.639
Water! Bring me water at once!

49:52.640 --> 49:55.644
The moss is dry. Water it!

51:19.320 --> 51:20.526
Your Highness!

51:21.280 --> 51:23.886
You must breathe out slowly.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.725
It's a boy!

51:28.760 --> 51:31.843
I saw a blue dragon
in my dream last night.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.282
We're going to have
a Royal Grandson!

51:34.283 --> 51:36.328
Thank you, my clear.

51:37.320 --> 51:42.326
I can finally face the ancestors
at the Royal Shrine.

51:42.880 --> 51:46.719
Your Highness, let me have a fan made
from this painting

51:46.720 --> 51:50.406
and offer it to the Grand Heir
on the day he ascends the throne.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.685
Congratulations, madam!

52:28.160 --> 52:31.243
You're going to have an audience
with your grandfather.

52:31.680 --> 52:32.841
You mustn't cry, my clear.

52:38.560 --> 52:41.291
The Grand Heir is here
to pay his respects to the King.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.289
Not now. Take him away.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.842
The Queen's 60th birthday is in two clays.

52:57.840 --> 53:01.322
But we haven't been able to prepare
without your word, Your Majesty.

53:03.400 --> 53:07.959
Lady Yi, when the King
doesn't issue a decree,

53:07.960 --> 53:10.611
there must be a reason, right?

53:12.760 --> 53:14.444
What should I do?

53:15.000 --> 53:19.642
His Majesty is swamped with duties.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.959
We, concubines, shouldn't
trouble him further.

53:21.960 --> 53:22.961
How dare you...!

53:22.962 --> 53:25.566
I won't hear any more of it.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.561
Leave! All of you!

53:35.760 --> 53:41.005
You dare disrespect the Crown Prince's birth
mother, only because the King favors you?

53:42.920 --> 53:44.331
Strike her harder.

53:47.760 --> 53:48.921
Give it here!

53:51.400 --> 53:57.760
You spiteful wench! I'll teach you
a lesson you won't forget.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.924
What do you think you're doing?

54:06.400 --> 54:07.561
Leave us!

54:19.240 --> 54:23.689
However little your affection
for the Queen is,

54:24.400 --> 54:28.530
you're yet to issue a decree
for her 60th birthday.

54:30.400 --> 54:34.928
Is that your intention
or that of your new consort?

54:37.040 --> 54:39.691
Isn't it thoughtful of
the Crown Prince's birth mother

54:40.360 --> 54:42.966
in wishing to celebrate
the Queen's birthday?

54:43.920 --> 54:49.051
And yet, the new consort
was disrespectful to her,

54:49.680 --> 54:56.962
instead of learning from her. So, I am
showing discipline among the royal consorts.

54:58.080 --> 55:03.086
If you act this way,
I cannot be King anymore.

55:04.080 --> 55:05.525
What did you say?

55:07.560 --> 55:11.042
Are you siding with that lowly thing

55:11.920 --> 55:14.366
because she has conceived your seed?

55:14.560 --> 55:15.721
Lowly thing?

55:16.600 --> 55:17.761
You call her lowly?

55:18.880 --> 55:21.403
You're the one who made me,
a low-born, king.

55:21.404 --> 55:23.562
Why don't you take away my throne, too?

55:25.840 --> 55:28.650
I shall abdicate my throne.
Grant your royal permission!

55:32.760 --> 55:33.966
Fine.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.931
Suit yourself.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.889
I give you my royal permission.

55:52.600 --> 55:58.130
No, Your Majesty!
We beg you to rescind the decree.

55:58.920 --> 56:02.811
Your Majesty!
I beseech you to revoke.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.169
It cannot be accepted.

56:08.600 --> 56:15.051
Your Majesty! Please rescind the royal
decree to turning over your throne.

56:15.480 --> 56:19.530
How many times did I tell you
that I don't care for the throne?

56:20.600 --> 56:24.605
I already obtained permission
from the Queen Dowager.

56:25.680 --> 56:26.966
Let's go.

57:33.440 --> 57:37.729
Your Highness, the King
has left the palace.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.880
Let's get up now.

57:41.560 --> 57:44.723
Please go back, Mother.

57:50.200 --> 57:55.206
Your Majesty the Queen Dowager, will you allow
the unthinkable to happen to the Crown Prince?

57:56.640 --> 57:59.041
Please revoke your royal permission.

57:59.640 --> 58:02.849
I shall teach the King a lesson

58:03.760 --> 58:07.606
so he won't distress
the poor Crown Prince again

58:09.040 --> 58:12.044
with insincere threats of abdication.

58:12.680 --> 58:20.610
But till now, you are the one
who's been protecting the Crown Prince.

58:21.920 --> 58:27.245
You're the only one in court,
who can save him now.

58:28.960 --> 58:35.969
Though I may be a frail woman,
I'm the Queen Dowager of this country.

58:37.800 --> 58:42.761
How can I revoke the words
that I've already spoken?

58:43.120 --> 58:48.968
However, Your Majesty, if you delay
the Crown Prince dies.

58:51.240 --> 58:54.528
Please save him, madam!

59:03.240 --> 59:04.571
If that is the case,

59:07.640 --> 59:10.086
it will all end when I die.

59:13.120 --> 59:14.770
From this day forward,

59:18.080 --> 59:20.321
do not bring me food.

59:21.640 --> 59:23.165
Your majesty!

59:29.840 --> 59:35.643
Tell the King that

59:38.000 --> 59:41.721
my aging ears misheard him

59:43.320 --> 59:50.363
and mistakenly issued the permission.

59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.846
Your Highness, the Queen Dowager revoked
her royal permission.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.322
Please rise.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.041
Your Highness.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.246
Your Highness.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.401
Your...!

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.245
If you had stayed put,
you'd have become King in time.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.165
Why did you have to make her revoke
her permission, and drove her to her death?

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.245
I am to blame for her death.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.922
You despicable serpent!

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.402
Do you think I don't know
how you really feel?

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.410
Yes! It is all is my fault.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.491
<i>The soul that left us today</i>

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.762
<i>If you may visit us</i>

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.484
<i>enjoy this good food</i>

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.522
<i>and drink from this cup</i>

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.119
<i>May you pass unto your descendants</i>

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.044
<i>the good fortune unspent in your life</i>

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.999
<i>Following the words of this mantra</i>

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.369
<i>please rid of grudges
and all hard feelings</i>

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.159
<i>but encourage kindness</i>

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.323
<i>and unload all worries</i>

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.524
<i>May only luck remain</i>

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.439
<i>May you enter nirvana</i>

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.489
<i>and reincarnate as a man</i>

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.766
<i>Namo Amitabha</i>

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:55.446
<i>By the Seven Stars</i>

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.171
<i>and the Supreme God...</i>

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.010
That's enough. His Highness doesn't have
the constitution for alcohol.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.210
Fill the cup.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.369
I fear for your health, Sire.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.127
Does this look like wine to you?

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.843
These are the bloody tears of
my grandmother whom I got killed.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.282
Your Highness, the King asks for you
at the Palace Academy.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.363
You've been neglecting
your duties as regent,

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.644
using the passing of the Queen
and Queen Dowager as excuses.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.091
So, I came here to greet you.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.443
I see you have abandoned your studies.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.922
Look at the state of your attire.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.570
Where is your hat?
And your coat tie is all loose.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.647
You... Have you been drinking?

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.440
I have, Sire.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.966
A Crown Prince, drunk during
the period of mourning...

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.921
Don't you know an army commander was beheaded
last month for violating alcohol prohibition?

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.323
Majesty, His Highness doesn't have
the constitution for alcohol.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.243
You Majesty should smell
his breath for wine.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.483
I just told the King that I drank.
How dare you say otherwise?

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.681
Leave us.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.521
One should not scold even a dog
in front of an elder.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.166
How dare you scold a court matron
in front of me?

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.364
I did so as she dared to
make an excuse.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.965
Bring water so I can
cleanse my ears.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.170
I am at fault

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.926
for appointing a useless wretch
like you as the Crown Prince.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.126
A mere woman risks her life
to defend me.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.368
Yet none of you spoke a word!

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.040
<i>THE FIFTH DAY</i>

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.406
Mong?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.481
Is that you?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.131
Does the Royal Grandson
feed you well?

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.805
And Crown Princess brushes you?

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.403
Why didn't you bark last night?

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.766
Are you frightened of the King, too?

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:59.407
Shouldn't we seek a way to protect
the Royal Grandson?

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:06.206
My intention was to save
both the King and the Crown Prince.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.724
Let me take care of my nephew
the Grand Heir.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.323
I beg your pardon?

01:07:14.324 --> 01:07:17.324
Who in here other than myself
can make him King?

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.483
You must entrust me with your son.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.279
Father listens to me.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.645
Absurd.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.770
Surely, you cannot bet the life of this
family on words of a low rank princess.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.648
Since the new Queen is installed,
the King's health has improved.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.840
This is without a doubt...
What are you doing here?

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.802
I must seek ways to
save myself and my family.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.208
Should the Grand Heir become King,

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.244
it'll be the end for all who
didn't stop his father's death.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.641
What do you suggest?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.446
We must do everything to prevent
the Grand Heir from ascending the throne.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.444
Then what?

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:13.770
If the new Queen bears a son,
that will put an end to the matter.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.410
And even if that fails, we could put
a dumb royalty on the throne

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.207
and have the Queen rule
as regent behind the veil.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:27.844
Indeed, it was our fathers
who drank poison

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.560
to save the King when he faced
charges of treason.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.359
Father,

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.366
Brother...

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.801
I'm terrified of the King.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.488
What is greater than a mountain
and deeper than an ocean?

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.242
It's the love of a parent.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.886
What do you think?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.524
It's the King's benevolence.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.721
It's a man's heart.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.725
A man's heart?
Why is that?

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.571
I learned that a man's spirit
is higher than a mountain

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.930
and a woman's fidelity
is deeper than an ocean.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.841
Sorry I...

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.531
If there's anything I can do
for you, tell me.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:56.248
I beg Your Majesty not topromote
the men in my family.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.569
I am blessed
with a wife of great wisdom.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.846
I'm not asking him to do
daily greetings.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.842
It's been over a month since
his new mother, the Queen is here.

01:10:16.843 --> 01:10:19.286
And the Crown Prince doesn't
pay his respects?

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.841
Due to his illness,

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.604
he has not been out
for some time now.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.927
Have him visit me
when he gets better.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.243
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.762
What nonsense!

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.371
Is he in his death bed?

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.999
<i>Died in vain</i>

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.243
<i>is this young soul</i>

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.841
Your Highness...

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.526
Open it.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.919
<i>White Guardian of the West</i>

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.999
<i>Yellow Guardian of the Center</i>

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.843
Where is the Crown Prince?

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.808
My dear mother...

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.089
How have you come to this,
having to serve a young Queen?

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.890
My Lord, you must stop this.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.887
And pay your respects
to the new Queen.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.039
I don't even visit my own mother.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.407
Why would I bother visiting her?

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.769
What would the Grand Heir
learn from your behavior?

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:53.924
Grand Heir! Grand Heir!
Is he all you care about?

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.129
I don't exist in your eyes, do I?

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.405
My Prince, I beg you
to reconsider for my sake.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:17.406
Oh my poor mother.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.444
Is the old fart mistreating you
since he has a new young wife?

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.881
Please!

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.728
I know, I know...

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.810
I'll stop by tomorrow morning
to show my face. So, don't you worry.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.130
It doesn't fit!

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.490
- Bring me another robe.
- Yes, Your Highness.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.522
Here is a new one.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.600
It's a brand new robe
completed this morning.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.119
Your Highness must hurry.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.647
The Queen hasn't had her breakfast
to wait for your greeting.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.882
This is not right. It's all wrong!

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.447
Your Highness. Sir...

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.131
Bring out another.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.969
A new robe!

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.209
Right now!

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.606
Please calm down, Sir.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.679
Bring out a robe!

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.489
There are no more, your Highness.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.804
Get me another!

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.679
I beg you to take heed.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.967
There are no more robes.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.681
Your Highness!

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.123
What's delaying him?

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.806
I cannot tell whether she is
thoughtful or just dumb.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.766
You mustn't speak of
the Queen that way.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.765
I wonder how she bewitched
the Father so completely.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.045
I heard they only hold hands in bed.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.601
Everyone that the old fart
favors are here.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.205
I cannot spend another day
in the same palace as him.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.804
Have the old man move
to Gyeonghui Palace.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.281
Or we shall all die together!

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.040
I hear you, brother. I'll do all I can
to make that happen.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.684
I will... I guarantee you, brother.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.764
<i>THE SIXTH DAY</i>

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.086
Stop shaking, you wretches.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.169
I'll die from dizziness.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.840
He's still alive.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.320
You cannot be here, Your Highness.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.726
Step aside!

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.244
I'm afraid I can't, sir.
It's the royal command.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.803
What is your name and rank?

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.248
Head of the King's guards,
Kim Do-su, Sir.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.084
I shall remember your name.
Step aside.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.166
Father, your daughter-in-law
brought you water.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.165
Father, your daughter-in-law
brought you water.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.646
Father, your daughter-in-law
brought you water.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.641
Come out of there, Father.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.164
Come out of there, Father.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.845
Father, your daughter-in-law
brought you water.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.799
Father, come out of there.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.799
Please come out.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.407
Your daughter-in-law brought you water.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.639
Your daughter-in-law
brought you water. Father!

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.961
Didn't I order to let no one in?

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:09.245
Can't a son offer water
to his own father?

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.400
The Grand Heir

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.002
is to stay with his mother's family

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.766
until further command.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.801
Does a king need many vassals
to be a good ruler?

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.725
Even with few vassals, one can be a
good ruler if he is a loyal king.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.246
Will it be easy to bring in wise men?

01:18:08.247 --> 01:18:12.484
If the king sets good examples,
it will be easy.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:21.084
A child barely 10 years old
has such a deep insight!

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:28.481
Then, can one match the heavenly high
virtues of kings Yaw and Sun?

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.289
Even though unattainably high, one can
match that by endeavoring clay and night..

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.479
Pass. He has passed.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.766
It's a pass!

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.488
Lineage of our dynasty depends
only on the Grand Heir.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.328
How can a son like this
come from a father like him?

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.884
'Like father like son'
doesn't apply to my family.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.007
Who is Sukjong the Great
who rests here?

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.959
He is my great-grandfather
and a king who reigned

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.123
for the longest period of 46 years
in Joseon's history.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.524
You must reign for even longer,
Grandfather.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.405
Why do you say that?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.446
Because that is the filial duty
in royal household.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.443
What does it mean to be King?

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.449
And to be a subject?

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:54.282
I have sat on this throne
for 37 years.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:00.286
I'm no longer sure
what it means to be King.

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.359
The king doesn't always get to
hold the sword handle,

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.046
and a servant doesn't
always hold the blade.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.004
Study hard.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:20.050
If you're not a learned king,
you can't hold the sword handle.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.363
I will take that to my heart.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.921
Son!

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.924
I heard you visited Sukjong's
tomb with your grandfather.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.199
Yes, Father.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.407
Do you really enjoy studying
that much?

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.999
Yes, Father.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.240
Why do you enjoy it?

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.849
Because it makes Grandfather happy.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.565
Is that right?

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.445
I hate myself for that.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.686
How dignified is that arrow
that flies freely through the air!

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.085
I could not attend your royal wedding
because the King didn't allow it.

01:21:28.086 --> 01:21:30.003
I'm sorry for that.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.011
My dear daughter-in-law.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:42.283
Man and wife must always cover
each other's mistakes.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.968
And not subject themselves
to trivial rules of etiquette,

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.680
but love each other clearly,
and more dearly for eternity.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.083
I'll take that to my heart.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:14.287
I wish to turn over the throne
to the Grand Heir.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.490
Who among you

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.124
will submit a petition
to depose the Crown Prince?

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.926
I'm afraid I cannot
obey that command, Sire.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.328
Even after witnessing all
the misconducts of the Prince?

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:38.323
I was even forced
to move out to this palace.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.201
Huh?

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:48.444
As his teachers, you are responsible
for what he has become.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.202
Write the petition as I instructed.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.561
It is a royal command.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.289
Finally, what we feared has happened.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:15.409
This was why the King
promoted us to ministers.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.403
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.405
<i>your joy and your wrath
change so whimsically</i>

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.610
<i>that it is difficult to discern
your true intentions.</i>

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.569
<i>I beseech you on my knees</i>

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.408
<i>to suppress your anger and
to show benevolence to the Crown Prince,</i>

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.650
<i>so that harmony can be
restored in this dynasty.</i>

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.765
Your Highness,

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.847
please go to Gyeonghui Palace
and reconcile with the King.

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.441
If you don't, all your vassals
will be put to death.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.362
When did I have any vassals?

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:14.041
Power cannot be shared
even between father and son.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.409
Just a few more years, and
you'll sit on the throne.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.171
Is it that hard to visit the King now
and then and pretending to study?

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:29.169
I don't want to live like that.
I can't live like that.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.201
I shall live by my own ways.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.164
Take a seat, mother.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.645
Make yourself comfortable.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.325
My dear mother,

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.848
please forgive your son for delaying 6
years in celebrating your 60th birthday.

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:07.890
Please forgive me.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.926
May you be blessed with
long life and good health.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.164
Bow.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.931
Rise.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.931
Bow.

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.289
Rise.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.206
Bow.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.686
Rise.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.251
Bow.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.726
Rise.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.251
The Grand Heir shall bow 4 times.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.289
But it is against the decorum.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.439
Wearing a queen's ceremonial robe
alone can cause trouble.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.644
If the King hears that
we bowed 4 times...

01:26:13.645 --> 01:26:15.608
Who is the head of this family?

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:25.687
At least for today,
let my mother be the Queen.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.846
Finish your bows.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.606
Bow.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.726
Rise.

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.245
Bow.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.250
Rise.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.566
Everyone shall bow 4 times!

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.205
Bow.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.001
Rise.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.765
Bow.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.241
Stand back!

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.961
It's the Queen's royal progress!

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.402
Stand back!

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.005
It's the Queen's royal progress!

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.010
Stand back!

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.363
It's my mother,

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:03.004
the Queen's progress!

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:19.046
It's my mother, the Queen's progress!

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.566
Stand back.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.087
Stand back.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.400
Stand back.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.082
Since vice-premier died to act
against the Crown Prince's deposition,

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.651
Ministers Min and Yi
have also committed suicide.

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:49.009
Those weak-hearted souls
only speak of reforms and cause.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.329
They run away when they're
scared to face the real world.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.407
The King's troubles are deep.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.406
We could help him.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.091
Why would he have any feelings left

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.606
for the Crown Prince who
doesn't even come to see him.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.089
If only the King's mind is set...

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.602
This could end in your death.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.724
I am prepared, my Lord.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.441
Know that your family
will be taken care of.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:33.048
The Crown Prince associated himself with
Buddhist nuns and courtesans.

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.443
He killed a eunuch

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.525
and conspired to kill the King
by storing weapons in a cave

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.168
behind the palace garden.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.810
I can't read any more.
Burn it.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.960
But Your Majesty,

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:57.803
it's an important evidence.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.003
Your Majesty, I find it hard to believe
that someone of his lowly status

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.959
can dare to report on the Crown Prince.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.045
I beg you to investigate who is behind him.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:23.406
How can you know about
affairs within the court walls?

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.891
The eunuch who was murdered by
the Crown Prince was my brother.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.887
We must find out who's behind.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.131
We beg of you, Your Majesty!

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.965
Your Highness, you can't be here.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:39.439
Sire! Allow me to confront him.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.602
Accusation of treason is preposterous!

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:47.599
How dare you try to frame me?

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.204
Who put you up to this?

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.804
My brother who you brutally killed!

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.206
You are more than capable
of high treason.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.609
Your majesty!

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.119
I lied about treason

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:08.763
to have an audience with you,
Your Majesty, to plead injustice.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:13.806
But everything about the Prince's
misconduct is true to the letter.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.559
Your Majesty,

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:21.930
falsely accusing the Crown Prince of treason is a
serious crime that shouldn't be taken lightly.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.047
You abominable wretches!

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.965
Even a lowly man like him acts
out of concern for this country

01:31:30.966 --> 01:31:32.962
and bravely reports
the Crown Prince's faults.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:37.081
You who receive stipend
didn't bother to report on him?

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.722
How can this country not be ruined?

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.599
Please allow the Crown Prince
to confront the man

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.080
and discover who is behind this.

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.959
Please, Your Majesty.

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:53.279
Your Majesty, even if
you take our disloyalty

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.284
and his unfortunate
circumstances into account,

01:31:56.285 --> 01:32:02.925
his crime of deceiving the King must be
punished by the most severe sentence.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.921
No, Your Majesty.
You mustn't execute him yet.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:13.160
I appreciate your loyalty and
I sympathize with your circumstances.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.683
Because of you, I have learned of
the Prince's misconducts.

01:32:16.684 --> 01:32:21.686
However, falsely accusing treason
is a great offense.

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.646
I command you

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.724
to behead him.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:28.961
Your majesty!

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.808
Before you execute him,
please find out who's behind him.

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.561
Please reveal the truth, Sire!

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:46.201
Do you really wish to
make your son a traitor?

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:53.687
Your existence in itself is treason.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.010
How dare you wield your sword
at your wife and sister?

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.171
What are you, a butcher?

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:05.321
This is all because of
my pent-up anger.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:09.084
Pent-up anger?

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.811
Why don't you just go mad?

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.767
I don't want to see your face. Go to
Geumcheon Bridge and beg for punishment.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.882
<i>The soul that left us today</i>

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:47.643
<i>If you may visit us</i>

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:53.248
<i>Enjoy this good food</i>

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:58.928
<i>And drink from this cup</i>

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.399
<i>May you pass unto</i>

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:07.244
<i>the good fortune
unspent in your life</i>

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:13.159
<i>Following the words of this mantra</i>

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.165
<i>please rid of grudges
and all hard feelings</i>

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.079
<i>but encourage kindness</i>

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.084
<i>and unload all worries</i>

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.159
<i>May only luck remain</i>

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.166
<i>May you enter nirvana
and reincarnate as a man</i>

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.162
What's the matter?

01:34:36.163 --> 01:34:38.925
The Crown Prince headed out
to the King's palace with his sword.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.441
MY Lord!

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.801
Step aside.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.445
Please stop, my Lord.
No, not this!

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.162
He says my existence
in itself is treason.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.320
I will show him.

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.761
Get out of my way.

01:35:07.762 --> 01:35:09.967
- Please stop.
- Out!

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.762
MY Lord!

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.770
MY Lord!

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.446
My Lady!

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.040
My Lady!

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.729
The Crown Prince has set out for
the King's palace with his sword.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.446
I fear for King's safety.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.330
If we don't stop him now,

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.764
he's going to bring down
the Royal Grandson with him.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.845
My Lady!

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.208
That's my grandson.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:23.570
I hear that your father threw a banquet
for your grandmother's 60th birthday?

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.365
That's true, Grandfather.

01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:30.931
I heard you bowed 4 times, too.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.130
That is also true, Grandfather.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.965
Your real grandmother is
but a mere concubine.

01:36:38.966 --> 01:36:42.851
Why did you bow 4 times
like you would to king or queen?

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.850
Isn't that against the decorum?

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.608
Answer me.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:02.287
I can bow before you a hundred,
a thousand times even if you weren't King.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.450
Why is that?

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.606
Because men come before
all laws and decorum.

01:37:08.607 --> 01:37:11.285
Not the other way round.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:17.130
Confucius also said not to see
the trivia of decorum but to see the heart.

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:26.006
That clay, I saw my father's heart.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.283
When your

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.006
older brother died

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.639
and I begot you at the age of forty.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.608
<i>THE SEVENTH DAY</i>

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:12.086
I was so overjoyed

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.001
that I invested you
the Crown Prince as a baby

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.288
and started educating you
as King from the age of 2.

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:25.967
I could never forget

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.521
the brightness and wisdom
you showed in those clays.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.328
But then...

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.409
you started playing with swords,

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:46.446
painting pictures of clogs,
and neglected your studies.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.008
And I felt as though the heaven
collapsed from top of me.

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:04.045
Is that why you had me
sit in front of your vassals

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.328
and made an imbecile out of me?

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:16.651
I did so out of desire
to make you a good king.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.521
Do you know how anxious I got

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.044
every time you made a mistake?

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.610
How is that my fault?

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.248
It was because you

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.048
gave the sword handle to your vassals
when you became King.

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:45.207
Don't you know the fate of a prince
who doesn't seize the throne?

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:51.569
If I didn't become the King
with their help,

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.407
I would've long been killed.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.401
You wouldn't exist, if I died back then.

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.202
Because I know that,

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:09.609
I tried so hard to understand you.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:17.402
But... the way you treated me

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.803
smothered me.
I couldn't endure it.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.281
Is learning so important?

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.131
Is one's attire so important?

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.846
Your subjects will look down on you

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.726
for your lack of learning
or for a crooked trouser tie.

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:49.368
In this country, learning is the country's
prime value. The decorum is the prime value.

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:58.209
Do you know why
I didn't kill you that night?

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.370
Because men come before
all laws and decorum.

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:12.171
How can learning or decorum
be the prime value if it oppresses men?

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.565
I don't want to be king,
I don't want power.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.729
All I wanted was

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.445
one loving gaze and...

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.283
one warm word from my father.

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:43.760
How is it that

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.731
you and I could only
have this conversation

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:01.370
at the crossroads of life and death?

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.206
I shall be...

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:20.121
recorded as a father
who killed his own son.

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.400
You...

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:34.242
won't be recorded as a traitor
who conspired to kill King

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.601
but as a lunatic

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.925
who tried to kill his own father.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.250
That's the only way...

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.842
that your son can be saved.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.528
If I weren't a King

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.966
and if you weren't the King's son,

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:25.291
how could this have happened?

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.005
This is our fate.

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.725
You...

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.651
my silly boy.

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.884
Why did you have to

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.048
make your old father

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.641
commit this atrocity?

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.604
How could a mother
who drove her son to death

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.483
expect to live?

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.127
Even the grass won't grow
on my tomb.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.809
Oh my baby.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.881
My Lady...

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:36.881
Madam!

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.167
How can you be at fault?

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:49.965
My son...

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.847
It wasn't me that got him killed.

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.679
It wasn't my fault, was it?

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.881
It wasn't my fault.
Tell me it wasn't my fault...

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.126
MY baby... my son...

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.965
Head back to the palace.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.609
Play the song of triumph.

01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.246
How relentless...

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:03.204
A triumphal music after
putting his own son to death.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.921
<i>THE EIGHTH DAY</i>

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.603
1,000 bags of rice!

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.162
2,000 bags!

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.009
3,000 bags!

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.165
In considering the Royal Grandson's heart,

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.721
and remonstration of my vassals,

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:36.451
I reinstate the Crown Prince's title

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:39.764
and grant him
the posthumous name 'Sa-Do'.

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.330
Sa as in 'to think'

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.049
and Do as in 'to mourn.'

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:04.086
Come with me.

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.765
<i>Now!</i>

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:12.804
He is not Prince Sado's
son any more.

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:17.766
We must send him off
to the King at once.

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.131
Take off your mourning clothes.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.481
No, Mother.

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:35.879
I don't want to.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.803
You must take it off and leave now.

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:39.805
No.

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:42.926
No.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:45.930
No, Mother.

01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:59.962
You must accede to the throne
if you wish to avenge your father's death.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.285
<i>14 YEARS LATER</i>

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.925
The reason

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:33.847
I abolish your father's record

01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:44.366
is for your kingship,
and this country's future.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:52.242
Whoever tries to elevate
your late father's title to a king

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.251
will be deemed traitor
to the dynasty.

01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.851
This is

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.522
a matter of loyalty to the throne.

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.843
I will take that to my heart.

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:16.285
From this moment,

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.364
never speak of the matters
concerning your father.

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:29.568
Agony is one thing,

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.443
loyalty is another.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:51.285
Return my King!

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:55.366
Return my King!

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:02.010
Return my King!

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.924
The spirit of Joseon's King,

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.843
please come back to the palace.

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:23.286
Long live our King!

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.364
Long live our King!

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.359
Long live our King!

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:39.445
<i>Father, your daughter-in-law
brought you water.</i>

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:44.610
<i>Father, your daughter-in-law
brought you water.</i>

01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:51.083
<i>Come out, Father.
Your daughter-in-law brought you water.</i>

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.291
Father,

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.010
drink this water.

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:16.329
Forgive your heartless wife.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.169
I came before you, my husband,

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:28.084
now that I turned 60 and
streaked with gray hair.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.562
Father, I am to blame for your death.

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.521
If I wasn't born,

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.963
it all wouldn't have happened.

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.727
Look at the commanding stature
of your son.

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.209
Please stretch your legs

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.769
and rest in peace.

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:25.006
Bow.

01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.041
Rise.

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.642
Bow.

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.528
Rise.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.408
Bow.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.367
Rise.

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.082
Bow.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:57.804
Rise.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.727
I wish to share with you
this joy of celebrating

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.571
the 60th birthday of
my mother and late father.

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:24.281
I witnessed so many
horrible events as a child,

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:29.205
I never had the chance
to make my mother laugh.

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.491
So, today, I will make up for it all.
