01:32.592 --> 01:35.219
<i>The mob war in Gotham continues tonight.</i>

01:35.303 --> 01:38.889
<i>Rival crime families led by
Rupert Theme and Arnold Stromwell</i>

01:38.973 --> 01:41.809
<i>continue to battle
for control of the city's underworld.</i>

01:41.892 --> 01:44.812
- That's a nice picture of you, boss.
- Pipe down!

01:44.895 --> 01:49.025
<i>According to Police Commissioner Gordon,
mob violence is intensifying.</i>

01:49.108 --> 01:52.194
<i>What we have here is a battle
between an older crime boss</i>

01:52.278 --> 01:56.073
<i>and his younger rival
for control of the rackets in Gotham.</i>

01:56.157 --> 01:59.035
<i>And in this case,
it looks like youth has the edge.</i>

01:59.118 --> 02:01.996
<i>I'd say Stromwell
is about to be retired.</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:03.664
We'll see about that!

02:03.914 --> 02:06.584
<i>But the struggle
may now be taking a tragic twist</i>

02:06.667 --> 02:10.671
<i>with the reported disappearance
of Arnold Stromwell's only son, Joseph.</i>

02:13.549 --> 02:16.552
Calm down, boss.
Remember your blood pressure.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.596
I want my son back.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.473
I know, Arnie. I know.

02:20.556 --> 02:22.433
This war has to stop.

02:22.516 --> 02:25.019
I want a meeting with Thorne,
and I want it tonight!

02:25.102 --> 02:27.355
I'll set it up, Mr. Stromwell.

02:38.866 --> 02:41.911
It's Thorne. He's got my son. I know it!

02:41.994 --> 02:43.162
I know it!

03:00.805 --> 03:03.391
Come on, buddy, you're out of here.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.436
Huh?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.651
Let's go.

03:18.572 --> 03:20.658
Stromwell wants the meeting tonight.

03:20.741 --> 03:23.452
We'll put out a sign that says
"private party."

03:23.536 --> 03:26.247
Yeah. A going-away party.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.375
When Arnie gets here,
we're all going to act nice-nice,

03:29.458 --> 03:32.002
make him feel we want a truce.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.256
AII everybody has to do
is follow my instructions.

03:35.339 --> 03:37.216
And you get the first cue, Pete.

03:37.299 --> 03:41.345
<i>It's got to go like clockwork.
After Pete leaves, the lights go out.</i>

03:41.429 --> 03:43.681
<i>We have to the count of five
to get clear,</i>

03:43.764 --> 03:46.684
<i>and it'll be all over
for Arnold Stromwell.</i>

04:05.286 --> 04:08.748
I'II teach Thorne to muscle in on me.
This is my town.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.624
I made it what it is.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.863
You got to swear
you won't squeal on me, Mike.

04:40.946 --> 04:44.617
Gee, Arnie, you keep stealing junk,
you're gonna get caught.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.869
Nah. Someday I'm gonna own this town.

05:00.007 --> 05:03.886
Arnie? What are you doing?
Get off the tracks!

05:04.845 --> 05:05.971
Arnie!

05:06.055 --> 05:07.139
Arnie!

06:20.004 --> 06:22.965
- Excuse me, Father.
- What can I help you with?

06:23.048 --> 06:24.049
You!

06:24.133 --> 06:27.845
It's coming down tonight, Father.
He's going to need you.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.139
Arnold?

06:32.057 --> 06:34.643
That's one soul
I wish I could give up on.

06:34.727 --> 06:38.063
I don't believe
you'd give up on anyone, Father.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.982
Please be there.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.884
Hi, Arnie.
I'm glad we could get together.

07:09.970 --> 07:13.098
We'll see, Thorne. It's time to talk.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.143
I think we should talk alone.
Man to man.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.687
Let the boys get some air.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.701
We made the news today.

07:32.785 --> 07:37.456
I saw. It's making things difficult.
You're making things difficult.

07:37.539 --> 07:41.126
Come on, Arnie. This town's big enough
for the two of us.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.504
- Where's my son?
- What?

07:43.587 --> 07:46.632
My son! Where is he?
What have you done to him?

07:50.302 --> 07:52.054
I don't know anything about it.

07:53.263 --> 07:54.723
You lowlife.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.520
You'd do anything to take over my city.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.106
I didn't touch your kid.
I swear it, Arnie.

08:02.189 --> 08:03.607
You know I don't mess with family.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.656
Hey, come on.

08:11.281 --> 08:13.200
We're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

08:13.283 --> 08:15.619
It's a shame about your kid.

08:15.911 --> 08:17.454
Maybe I can help.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.707
- How?
- Well, I've got connections you don't.

08:31.176 --> 08:32.302
Good.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.180
Now, we can't talk on an empty stomach.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.517
Pete, I want to see an antipasto
out here that'll knock our socks off.

09:08.338 --> 09:09.590
The boss!

09:12.009 --> 09:14.636
- You can't go in there.
- It was a setup!

09:14.720 --> 09:16.680
We can't do nothing now.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.350
We've got to regroup.
Come on, before the cops get here.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.359
Consider yourself replaced, Arnie.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.196
It's party time.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.304
Oh. What...

09:59.515 --> 10:01.850
No! Where am I?

10:07.189 --> 10:08.524
I'm alive.

10:09.024 --> 10:10.984
You! What are you doing?

10:11.276 --> 10:12.903
Saving your hide.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.410
Whoa. Heavy barbecue action, man.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.042
Wow! He's really out there.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.713
Let me go, you caped freak!

10:45.894 --> 10:48.772
The media's going to nail us
on this one.

10:50.065 --> 10:51.692
What are you looking at?

10:51.775 --> 10:54.611
Your hair. It looked better on TV.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.991
Definitely arson, Commissioner Gordon.
A bomb.

10:59.074 --> 11:01.785
Darn shame. They make the best cannolis.

11:03.871 --> 11:07.332
- Anybody in there?
- There's no evidence anyone was inside.

11:07.416 --> 11:11.545
There was somebody in there!
Batman saved his butt! I seen them, man.

11:11.628 --> 11:15.132
He was just leaping on the rooftops,
carrying somebody on his shoulders.

11:15.215 --> 11:16.258
I seen it!

11:16.341 --> 11:20.345
Like a dark angel snatching the guy
from the fires of Hades, man.

11:26.268 --> 11:29.521
Your news puts a crimp
in our celebration, Simon.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.481
Sorry, Mr. Thorne.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.818
But why would Batman
want to save a guy like Stromwell?

11:34.902 --> 11:38.197
To get him to spill his guts
about the organization.

11:39.281 --> 11:42.201
Get everyone on the street!
Check the train yards.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.495
Find Stromwell and the Batman
and get rid of them!

12:00.052 --> 12:02.179
All right. Why the heroics?

12:02.262 --> 12:04.389
You've got something I want.

12:04.848 --> 12:06.767
Oh, yeah? What's that?

12:06.850 --> 12:09.144
Information. About the gangs.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.899
Well, I appreciate
your saving my life and all,

12:13.982 --> 12:16.902
but you're gonna have to come up with
a better reason for me to turn stoolie.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.448
I'll try and deliver.

12:26.161 --> 12:27.704
Whoa.

12:35.545 --> 12:36.838
You're gonna pay for this!

12:38.131 --> 12:41.134
Hey, I know this place.
I started out here.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.594
Selling drugs.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.471
Prove it.

12:44.554 --> 12:48.058
- And now you manufacture them.
- Prove that, too.

12:48.141 --> 12:50.769
Nobody twists anybody's arm
to take them, you know.

12:50.852 --> 12:52.896
And for the record, I make candy.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.775
Hey, what are you doing?

13:02.114 --> 13:05.617
"Sunrise Foundation."
Means nothing to me.

13:15.919 --> 13:17.629
What is this place?

13:17.838 --> 13:19.631
A drug rehab center.

13:20.465 --> 13:22.301
No. I ain't going in.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.928
Your 10-cent tour of the city's over.

13:27.055 --> 13:29.766
So what could it hurt?
One little look, right?

13:34.938 --> 13:35.981
Joey!

13:36.064 --> 13:38.734
Yes, and he's lucky. He'll pull through.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.028
Connie! Why didn't you call me?

13:41.194 --> 13:42.946
I didn't know until today.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.574
I'd never have known
if it weren't for Batman.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.539
Don't get any closer.
The nurse said not to disturb him.

13:52.914 --> 13:55.500
I'll find the guy who got him hooked.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.002
Just look in the mirror.

13:57.085 --> 13:59.671
It was your drugs
and your people who sell them.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.424
I left you to get away
from what you were doing.

14:02.507 --> 14:04.259
Our son wasn't so lucky.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.726
Help stop it, Stromwell.

14:12.976 --> 14:16.855
All your power and money has bought you
is an empire of misery.

14:17.939 --> 14:21.443
- What do you want me to do?
- Close down the organization.

14:21.526 --> 14:24.738
Talk to the DA.
Turn in all the records.

14:24.821 --> 14:26.865
It has to stop, Stromwell.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.993
It has to stop now!

14:44.925 --> 14:47.594
Here are the records. Look them over.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.524
These are dummy books.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.901
Yeah. And you're the dummy.

15:09.908 --> 15:13.245
They're both up there, all right.
Let's smoke 'em out!

15:13.578 --> 15:16.206
You think I'd go down that easy? Ha!

15:16.581 --> 15:19.709
I got scores to settle.
I'm big bad news.

15:19.793 --> 15:23.255
- Always have been, always will be.
- What about Joey?

15:23.338 --> 15:26.550
I'm getting him out of that freak ward,
so I know he'll get better.

15:26.633 --> 15:28.969
You're fooling yourself
again, Stromwell.

15:29.052 --> 15:33.640
You're the fool, Batman.
Now, if you just stay nice and quiet...

15:37.519 --> 15:38.770
Tear gas!

15:59.916 --> 16:01.585
Look out!

16:04.713 --> 16:06.840
Stash, Freddy, get up there.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.845
Stay here. Don't move.

16:32.407 --> 16:34.034
Stash? That you?

16:36.244 --> 16:37.787
Where's Batman?

16:56.389 --> 16:57.432
Huh?

16:59.476 --> 17:01.019
You blew it, you jerks!

17:12.531 --> 17:14.616
Over there! It's Stromwell!

17:31.800 --> 17:32.926
He ain't here.

17:33.009 --> 17:35.011
He's got to be here somewhere.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.810
Arnie, it's time to come home.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.605
No! Get away from me.

18:27.647 --> 18:29.316
You can't run anymore, Arnie!

18:49.794 --> 18:51.338
Go ahead, take some.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.090
No! You stole that candy, Arnie.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.010
- I don't want it.
- Oh, what a mama's boy!

18:57.093 --> 18:59.262
No! Not again!

18:59.721 --> 19:02.057
Someday, I'm gonna own this town.

19:13.818 --> 19:14.903
Get off!

19:14.986 --> 19:16.154
Get off!

19:16.237 --> 19:19.908
Arnie? What are you doing?
Get off the tracks!

19:22.744 --> 19:25.372
Arnie! Arnie!

19:32.712 --> 19:35.382
Jump, Arnie. Jump!

20:06.788 --> 20:09.207
Michael? Michael!

20:10.458 --> 20:13.378
Michael! Michael!

20:13.461 --> 20:16.589
- I'm here, Arnie.
- What are you doing here, Michael?

20:16.673 --> 20:19.968
- I came to help you, Arnie.
- I don't need your help.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.429
Is that a fact?

20:22.512 --> 20:27.016
An empire crumbling.
A marriage shattered. A son lost.

20:27.475 --> 20:29.185
Sure, you're doing fine.

20:42.198 --> 20:43.491
Stay away, Michael.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.869
Last time you helped me,
it cost you your leg.

20:45.952 --> 20:48.663
Oh, I get by. Knock on wood.

20:49.330 --> 20:52.542
You knew I was no good, Mike.
Why did you save me?

20:52.709 --> 20:54.836
Arnie, what else could I do?

20:54.919 --> 20:57.756
But now, you've got a chance
to save yourself.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.341
Come on, Arnie. Do the right thing.

21:00.633 --> 21:03.136
For yourself, for your son.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.972
For me, your little brother.

21:10.101 --> 21:11.186
Michael.

21:14.105 --> 21:17.484
Your family reunion
touches me, Stromwell.

21:17.692 --> 21:19.319
Now say goodbye.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.927
Commissioner Gordon,
I have a statement to give you.

22:19.712 --> 22:20.713
English - SDH
