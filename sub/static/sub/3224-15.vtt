00:04.080 --> 00:05.923
Ed and Harry,
the Ghostfacers.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.808
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Uh, we belong here.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.651
- We're professionals.
- Professional what?

00:13.960 --> 00:15.166
Paranormal investigators.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.200
This stuff right here...
This is our ticket to the big time...

00:18.280 --> 00:22.126
Fame, money, sex...
with girls.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.923
- We are family.
- Everything that has ever gone

00:26.120 --> 00:28.646
wrong between us has been
because we're family.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.080
So, what?
We're not family now?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.886
I'm saying you want to work...
let's work.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.761
You said that you wanted to
keep things strictly business.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.088
I wanted to keep things
strictly business between us.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.808
- About what you said the other day...
- I thought it didn't bother you.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.730
I may not think things
all the way through,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.007
but what I do, I do
because it's the right thing.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.726
You didn't save me for me.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.764
You did it for you.

01:15.920 --> 01:16.967
Mom?

01:17.520 --> 01:18.726
Mom, are you home?

01:58.880 --> 02:00.370
911. What is your emergency?

02:00.560 --> 02:01.721
There's someone in my room.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.801
What is your location?

02:05.640 --> 02:07.404
Can you give us a location, ma'am?

02:08.360 --> 02:09.725
Are you still there?

02:10.759 --> 02:13.969
Ma'am, please do not hang up.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.320
I've begun tracing your call,

02:15.520 --> 02:17.329
but I need you to stay
on the line for me.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.810
Please stay on the line.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.362
We'll send out an officer...

02:41.960 --> 02:43.200
All right.
I'll be back.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.921
Wait.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.401
Where you headed?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.763
Washington.
I caught a case.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.089
You want me to come with?

02:52.160 --> 02:53.207
Do you want to come?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.444
On a hunt?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.963
Why wouldn't I?

02:59.240 --> 03:01.891
I don't know, man. 'Cause lately
with you, up is down and...

03:02.280 --> 03:03.441
...down is sideways,
you know?

03:03.640 --> 03:06.291
I-I...
I don't know what you want.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.328
Okay. You want in?
Fine.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.323
Sure thing.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.770
Photo leaked
from the crime scene.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.080
Girl was murdered in her room,

03:23.120 --> 03:24.800
doors were locked,
the windows were locked.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.683
- Who's the Wallflower?
- Exactly.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.284
Best guest,
ghost caught on film.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.480
So, you're coming.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.680
Does it look like I'm staying?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.562
I scrubbed for hours.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.649
I'll have to rip up the carpet.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.084
My daughter, Casey...

04:02.640 --> 04:04.608
She picked out the color herself.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.009
We're very sorry
for your loss, Mrs. Miles.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.161
You mentioned Casey
had no known enemies.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.164
What about at home?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.286
Anything unusual
you may have noticed?

04:17.640 --> 04:21.884
Uh... Electricity acting up
or lights flickering,

04:22.079 --> 04:23.241
TV on the fritz?

04:23.520 --> 04:26.888
No, no fritzing.
No cold spots, either.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.523
Sorry.
Out of curiosity, uh...

04:33.880 --> 04:35.291
Why do you mention cold spots?

04:35.680 --> 04:38.365
I'm sorry.
That must sound strange, but...

04:40.160 --> 04:41.810
...it's been three days since...

04:42.320 --> 04:44.800
And the police
have found nothing.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.843
I'd...
I'd have to sell my house

04:47.000 --> 04:49.606
to afford a private investigator,

04:49.920 --> 04:51.410
so when
the Supernaturalists called...

04:51.760 --> 04:54.923
Whoa, uh, sorry, the...
Um... Supernaturalists?

04:55.240 --> 04:58.926
I know to the FBI
it's not exactly orthodox.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.968
But these men had answers
that no one else had, and I...

05:04.040 --> 05:06.520
I owe it to Casey...

05:06.920 --> 05:08.081
...to listen.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.724
Now, they... they brought up
cold spots in relation to...

05:13.240 --> 05:15.686
Signs of the paranormal,
I suppose.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.044
They're coming by today
to take a look.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.570
And did these Supernaturalists
give you a name?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.209
♪ Ghostfacers ♪

05:30.880 --> 05:32.211
Son of a bitch.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.005
Oh, wow, look.
We got two more followers.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.286
Mm.

05:38.840 --> 05:39.841
Yeah. Harry,

05:40.040 --> 05:41.920
I think it's from
that library interview we did.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.241
Nice.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.724
- Hey, pal.
- Hmm?

05:47.880 --> 05:49.166
- What did Dana post?
- No, it's just...

05:49.360 --> 05:51.966
she changed her profile pic,
and it's cropped,

05:52.200 --> 05:55.044
but you can clearly see
a guy's arm around her.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.000
And she's smiling like the dickens.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.845
Yeah. Uh, it...
it could a platonic...

05:59.960 --> 06:01.769
...arm that's touching her.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.401
Ah, the Winchesters. Yay.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.971
- Says nobody.
- Ever.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.844
All right, shut up and listen.
This is how it's gonna go.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.042
You two clowns are gonna get into

06:12.240 --> 06:15.050
that mystery machine outside,
and you're gonna leave town

06:15.160 --> 06:16.730
or I'm gonna put holes
in your knees.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.730
Can I get you guys anything?
Something, uh...

06:20.080 --> 06:21.525
Uh, we're ready for the bill.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.729
Hey.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.851
There's still crud on this plate.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.731
Now, hit the sinks and do it right.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.771
Sorry, Trey.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.450
First of all,
you guys don't scare us.

06:36.880 --> 06:37.881
Not at all.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.045
Say, ola to my little pistola.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.964
Am I supposed to be impressed
with that treasure trail

06:44.160 --> 06:47.289
or the lady gun you got hiding
in your, uh, pants there?

06:47.840 --> 06:50.320
Uh, both?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.322
Look, whether you like it or not,

06:53.520 --> 06:55.204
we are handling this situation.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.401
- Yup.
- Really?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.130
- Mm-hm.
- 'Cause I see a couple of fame whores

06:58.320 --> 07:00.720
who are pointing their camera
at a mom who just lost her kid.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.009
Guys, we are investigators,
and we have every right...

07:04.200 --> 07:05.690
No. No, you don't.
You know why?

07:05.840 --> 07:06.887
'Cause you're just gonna get
in our way.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.525
Or you're gonna get
somebody else killed.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.963
That's right. So, you can
either walk out of here...

07:12.200 --> 07:13.850
...or crawl.
Up to you.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.891
Oh, my God, Menudo.
Will you guys relax?

07:17.640 --> 07:18.801
We know what we're going.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.371
- Yup.
- Really?

07:20.520 --> 07:22.284
And what about the rest
of the Bad News Bears, huh?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.164
Where's the...
Where's the fat one?

07:25.480 --> 07:27.323
And the girl?
There was a girl, right?

07:28.200 --> 07:30.646
They... We dropped them.
They were dead weight.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.962
- Well, t-they're still alive.
- They're... no, they're totally alive.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.481
I see. So, it's just the,
uh, the dumpy duo, then.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.688
Well, that's great.
So, here's the deal.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.970
A ghost will land you two dead
in five seconds flat.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.970
A ghost? Oh.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.487
They think it's a ghost.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.403
- It's so not a ghost.
- No.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.843
Okay. wen bite.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.241
What do you think it is?

07:54.840 --> 07:55.727
Can I do it this time?

07:55.840 --> 07:56.921
- You got it.
- Okay.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.843
I've waited all my life for this.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.410
Amazon me, bitches.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.322
I will shoot you...

08:06.640 --> 08:07.641
Bitches.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.481
Like we were saying,
you were just going, right? Great.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.207
Good talk.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.970
Fifty shades of way too much protein.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.291
- Uh, Dean?
- Yeah?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.929
Ed and Harry wrote a book.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.843
- What?
- Yeah.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.408
"The Skinny on Thinman",

08:34.559 --> 08:37.530
by America's foremost
Supernaturalists.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.481
What the hell's a Thinman?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.923
I don't know.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.520
Whoa.
Check that out, though.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.649
That does kind of look like

08:46.800 --> 08:48.768
whatever was behind
Casey Miles, right?

08:49.720 --> 08:51.961
Or Garth if somebody
shaved his face off.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.281
Big whoop-

08:54.520 --> 08:55.601
Here we go.
"Thinman...

08:55.800 --> 08:58.121
an urban legend started
on the world wide web

08:58.200 --> 09:00.089
lurks in the background
of his victims' lives

09:00.280 --> 09:01.520
until he's ready to kill them."

09:01.840 --> 09:04.366
Yeah, because everything started
on the Internet is true.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.320
Like, uh, oh, the shark
attacking a helicopter.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.000
They write the book
on that one, too?

09:09.080 --> 09:10.570
Dude, real or not,

09:10.680 --> 09:12.569
thousands of people
have posted sightings.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.120
It's like Thinman is
the new Bigfoot or something.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.721
Or Thinman is just a ghost
with a brand name.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.801
You saying that
'cause you really think

09:20.960 --> 09:23.327
it's a ghost or because
you don't like the Ghostfacers?

09:23.640 --> 09:26.166
Hey, don't forget,
we hit EMF in Casey's room.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.010
Right, but the house was
next door to power lines,

09:29.200 --> 09:30.247
which can affect the read.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.723
A girl died in a locked room, Sam,
spells "ghost" right there.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.124
Maybe it got in there before it was
locked up. Who knows, Dean?

09:37.320 --> 09:39.560
But how can people all over
the world see the same ghost?

09:40.160 --> 09:41.480
Spirits don't exactly hop around.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.841
I know that.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.129
But right now, the veil is
all kinds of screwed, okay?

09:45.320 --> 09:46.845
Ghosts could be
popping up anywhere.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.921
Yeah, but, Dean, Thinman sightings
date back a couple years.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.960
The veil's only been a problem for,
what, the last six months?

09:53.120 --> 09:55.600
Well, you know, people still see
Elvis all over the damn place.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.440
Look, all I'm saying
is those douchewheels...

09:58.040 --> 10:00.964
...ain't experts on crap.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.240
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking the local deaths

10:04.320 --> 10:06.561
to see if there's any candidates
for ghosts.

10:13.760 --> 10:18.322
The closet... The setting
of the sunset of Casey's life.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.891
- Harry.
- Yeah?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.924
Come on, man,
would you please stop

10:23.200 --> 10:24.884
Facebook stalking
your ex-girlfriend?

10:25.080 --> 10:26.730
I was right.
Hmm.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.885
She changed her relationship status
to "it's complicated."

10:31.640 --> 10:32.641
What does that even mean?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.365
Who cares?
You broke up with her.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.284
Everything about that girl
is complicated.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.881
Okay, I mean,
she gets the cream puffs,

10:38.040 --> 10:39.041
she tells you
to take out the filling.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.009
They're just puffs.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.001
Yeah, that was
some pretty messed-up stuff.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.527
Mm-hm.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.563
Uh, okay.
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.689
Okay. I'm good.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.765
Back on game. Yeah.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.880
We're so close
to finding Thinman, Ed.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.763
- Mm-hm.
- I can smell him.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.769
- I can smell his musk.
- Mm-hm.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.250
Closer than ever.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.008
- This is really serious, Harry.
- Yeah.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.320
I mean, the Winchesters
are here, and, you know,

11:14.440 --> 11:16.488
I don't want my knees blown off
by Sam and Dean.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.921
Have you ever thought
that we might just,

11:20.080 --> 11:21.650
you know, bail on this?

11:22.960 --> 11:23.961
What?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.647
What the...
What the hell is wrong with you?

11:26.840 --> 11:29.446
We can't let those
jockstraps steal our glory.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.128
No one cares what they think.
They don't even have a Twitter.

11:32.360 --> 11:37.685
We're gonna find Thinman, Ed,
for our families... for Dana.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.602
So, it's about
your ex eating her words?

11:42.040 --> 11:45.089
It's about making
all the haters eat their words.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.727
Maggie and Spruce...
they're just deserters.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.241
They want to lead a "normal life".
I mean, what is that?

11:51.640 --> 11:52.960
- Screw them. Right?
- Screw them.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.203
When we find Thinman,
are they gonna be on Dr. Phil?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.169
- No.
- We're gonna be on Dr. Phil.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.489
- Hell, yeah. Press "record," buddy.
- You got it.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.800
- Yeah...
- Wait for it.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.885
- You ready?
- Yep.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.083
The bedroom of a teenage girl
is meant for two things...

12:12.960 --> 12:14.200
...giggles and joy.

12:14.680 --> 12:20.323
Until one night, Thinman
turned the giggles into blood.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.003
You are so money right now.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.406
- You like that?
- This is good stuff.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.410
And it's gonna pay off
in ladies Ed, lots of ladies.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.688
We're gonna need...
We're gonna need snorkels...

12:31.440 --> 12:34.125
...'cause we're gonna be
swimming around in so much...

12:35.320 --> 12:37.322
Thought you boys might be thirsty.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.129
Please.
That sounds delicious.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.089
Okay. All right,
over the past six months,

12:46.320 --> 12:48.891
There have been three
unnatural deaths in Springdale,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.685
none of them connected to
Casey Miles and none of them violent.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.006
Okay, that's not exactly
a recipe for a vengeful spirit.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.048
There have been
a bunch of unexplained deaths

12:58.200 --> 12:59.201
pinned on Thinman.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.289
A vic dies,
then, a couple weeks later,

13:01.480 --> 13:04.131
a photo pops up of the vic
with Thinman photobombing.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.051
- So, Thinman's stalking folks?
- According to the lore.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.440
According to the idiots.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.485
How come none of these
vics pinged our radar?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.160
I'm pretty sure
the mysterious deaths

13:12.280 --> 13:14.408
can be chalked up
to non-supernatural causes.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.484
That and, honestly...

13:17.240 --> 13:18.969
...most of these photos
look pretty fake.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.363
- Even Casey's?
- Except Casey's.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.531
Casey's photo...
wasn't doctored.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.801
Whatever was behind her...
was really there.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.606
Okay, well,
that doesn't make any sense.

13:30.800 --> 13:34.168
I mean, how could something be
both real and fake at the same time?

13:35.840 --> 13:39.128
Well, a girl is dead,
and that's about as real as it gets.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.127
All right, so,
the last thing she did

13:44.320 --> 13:46.891
was she took a photo
on her phone.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.128
How did that photo
end up online?

13:49.440 --> 13:50.441
No clue.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.570
It was originally posted
to a Thinman fan forum,

13:53.760 --> 13:55.000
but the IP address was blocked.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
This thing has fans?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.090
Of course it does.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.760
Okay, well, then somebody wanted
this photo on the Internet,

14:03.960 --> 14:07.248
and I'm guessing that the ghost
didn't hop online to post it.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.727
Sheriff, there's a couple questions
we'd like to ask him.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.281
Sorry to disappoint.
Sheriff's on a hunting trip.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.331
But, I appreciate
you agents being here.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.920
I could use all the help I can get.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.960
Wait a second. Was this cracked
when you found it?

14:24.440 --> 14:25.805
Yeah, man.
Maybe she dropped it?

14:26.040 --> 14:28.008
911 call went dead at 11:59.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.961
- What time was the photo posted?
- Around 2:00 AM.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.924
But the coroner has
the death at midnight.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.440
How could she have posted
the photo from her phone?

14:34.640 --> 14:35.641
That's impossible.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.407
Or... supernatural.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.448
- What?
- Why would you say that?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.684
A couple fellas came by,
asking questions about the girl's death,

14:44.880 --> 14:45.881
suggested they might
be able to help.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.646
They, uh, gave me a book
they wrote about...

14:49.240 --> 14:50.605
Thinman?

14:51.160 --> 14:52.207
Yeah.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.887
Not a fan?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.731
There is still probably...

16:09.160 --> 16:11.322
Agents, thanks for coming.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.561
What are these
two crapshoots doing here?

16:16.960 --> 16:20.442
I figured it wouldn't hurt to go
a little "medium," you know?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.481
Uh...

16:23.600 --> 16:26.729
Two counties over,
folks were combing the place

16:26.920 --> 16:28.922
for a poor little dead boy
back in August.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.691
The cops let a psychic
do her thing.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.127
Shish, bang, boom...
Found a body a day later.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.800
- Excuse me.
- Is there any security-cam footage?

16:37.920 --> 16:39.649
Yeah, just...

16:40.920 --> 16:42.684
- Hey.
- Aah!

16:43.960 --> 16:45.240
I thought I told you to beat it.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.286
Well, what are you gonna do?
You gonna out me, "agent"?

16:52.880 --> 16:55.121
Okay, look, playing paparazzi
at a crime scene...

16:55.360 --> 16:56.361
who does that help
but yourselves?

16:56.560 --> 16:59.131
The bloggers, Dean,
the believers...

16:59.760 --> 17:01.240
Everyone who needs
just a little proof

17:01.320 --> 17:03.846
to know that Thinman
is out there.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.045
Wait, so, you're saying
there's a lot of folks online

17:06.240 --> 17:07.366
that are pretty die-hard
about this thing?

17:07.880 --> 17:09.405
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.599
You throw the right
Tibetan symbol into the mix...

17:12.280 --> 17:15.409
...you dumb asses ever think
the Thinman comes to life as a Tulpa?

17:15.760 --> 17:17.046
Because thousands of people

17:17.359 --> 17:19.646
can agree that Thinman
is any one thing?

17:20.839 --> 17:22.762
The lore changes blog to blog.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.090
- He's not a Tulpa.
- Okay, all right. All right.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.163
Right here, right now,
cut the crap.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.971
Do either of you actually
know what Thinman is?

17:31.120 --> 17:34.681
No. We just play
Supernaturalists on TV.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.805
We have no idea what we're doing.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.167
Of course we do.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.528
Thinman, is part man, part tree.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.082
Some people believe
that he emerged

17:48.280 --> 17:51.011
from the nightmare
of an autistic boy.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.531
All right, so you have no idea.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.405
Fellas, you want to see this.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.483
All right, check it out.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.525
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.605
All right, so, how did he jump
from the parking lot to the diner?

18:13.800 --> 18:14.801
The doors were locked?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.764
The footage shows Trey
locked them ten minutes before.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.849
Locked, not locked,
it doesn't matter.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.411
Everyone knows
Thinman can teleport.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.728
I didn't even
get a blip on my EMF.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.851
So, maybe it's not a ghost.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.044
You Feds believers now?

18:28.480 --> 18:30.448
Okay, uh...
We're gonna go.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.971
- Yep.
- Good work, deputy, agent.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.242
- Let's go. Let's go, man.
- With me.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.207
Let's see it again.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.600
Let's get out.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.368
Holy wow.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.200
Someone posted
the diner footage of Thinman

18:50.280 --> 18:51.770
in the comments section
of our blog.

18:51.960 --> 18:52.961
- Who?
- Who cares?

18:53.680 --> 18:56.206
Maintain current velocity.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.371
Hey, why are you
putting your ninja outfit on?

19:03.960 --> 19:05.644
I'm not gonna wait
for someone else to die.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.208
I'm gonna find Thinman tonight.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.211
- Where?
- The woods, obvi.

19:10.880 --> 19:11.927
That's kind of general.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.731
Well, the lore says that
Thinman hangs out by trees,

19:14.920 --> 19:17.287
and the woods
is where trees hang out.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.370
Two kills in town.
Local Wood's the best bet.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.328
Two people are dead.
Really dead.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.488
And I just keep thinking
that, you know,

19:26.720 --> 19:29.883
maybe Sam and Dean
should just take over.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.488
First of all, hell no.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.604
And quit raining on my rainbow.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.320
Rainbows can't happen
without rain.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.286
Don't try to use science with me.
This is about a feeling.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.240
And we can't quit
when we're so close

19:43.280 --> 19:44.840
to finding Thinman
and finally making up

19:44.920 --> 19:47.161
for everything we've lost
because of... what we do.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.523
Okay, it wouldn't be the worst idea,
though, you know,

19:49.720 --> 19:51.290
if we leave it
to the professionals.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.604
We are the professionals, Ed.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.764
So, the woods?

20:00.360 --> 20:03.330
Any woods, Ed.
Any woods.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.206
Just grasping at straws here,
but when I think "teleport,"

20:08.760 --> 20:11.047
I think "Crossroads Demon."

20:11.800 --> 20:12.801
Mm.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.005
Demon that likes to stab
and watch YouTube. Why not?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.040
Oh, by the way, speaking of which...

20:19.600 --> 20:22.570
...the video of,
Trey getting knifed...

20:24.000 --> 20:26.207
...it's already online.
It has, like, 2,000 views.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.165
It's like somebody wants people
to see Thinman in action.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.921
It's 'cause people will watch,
'cause people are sick.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.171
And when did "viral" go
from that baby chimp

20:35.360 --> 20:39.160
falling out of a tree
to Killer Candid Camera?

20:41.480 --> 20:43.920
You know what video would have
gone viral, if we still had it?

20:44.200 --> 20:45.929
When you were five
and you got dressed up as Batman

20:46.120 --> 20:48.691
and you jumped off the shed
'cause you thought you could fly.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.080
After you jumped first.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.328
Hey, I was nine, and I was
dressed up like superman, okay?

20:52.560 --> 20:53.686
Everybody knows
that Batman can't fly.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.440
Well, I didn't know that.
I broke my arm.

20:55.560 --> 20:56.561
I know you did.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.248
Man, I drove you to the ER
on my handlebars.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.005
Well, good times.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.685
Yeah, they were.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.209
Come on in.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.280
I got to tell you guys
something important...

21:30.880 --> 21:32.370
...and then the case is yours.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.645
Harry here, solo Ghostfacer,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.561
investigating a possible
Thinman habitat...

21:45.240 --> 21:47.686
...in the woods.

21:48.520 --> 21:54.641
All alone, deep in the woods,
a man could lose his marbles

21:54.840 --> 21:57.810
being so close
to the blade of doom.

21:58.640 --> 22:03.931
Lucky for us,
I'm really good at marbles.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.166
All right, either you bleed
Ghostfacers red or you don't.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.720
If Spruce wanted to start
a startup

22:08.840 --> 22:10.524
and Maggie's heart
was in the roller derby,

22:10.760 --> 22:11.761
who am I to stop them?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.040
But Harry... I couldn't
let him give in to his girl.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.924
I mean, she called
the Ghostfacers stupid.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.009
Stupid! Can you believe that?

22:18.440 --> 22:19.441
You know, I don't care

22:19.600 --> 22:20.931
how much money
her daddy's hedge fund has.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.401
I just couldn't watch Harry
become a corporate stooge.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.604
Okay, this all sounds like
sad times at Bitchmont High.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.761
What does this
have to do with the case?

22:27.960 --> 22:31.407
Harry was gonna leave, so I needed
to give him a reason to stay.

22:34.280 --> 22:37.011
I... I made up Thinman.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.849
Thinman stalks his victims,

22:44.480 --> 22:46.801
but the tables have turned,
my friends.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.847
The stalker is now the stalkee.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.766
So you're saying that
this crap is actually crap?

22:55.960 --> 22:58.645
One old photo of a butler,
a lot of Photoshop later,

22:58.800 --> 23:01.770
and I posted on one of those
horror forums under "anonymous".

23:01.960 --> 23:03.291
- And it blew up.
- Yeah.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.286
I only faked one case for us, and
then we're packing up to go home

23:07.360 --> 23:09.040
when somebody posted
a sighting of Thinman,

23:09.160 --> 23:11.686
so we went after it,
and that's how the Thinman

23:11.880 --> 23:13.882
became a crowdsourced legend.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.250
Look, we were at the front of it.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.801
It felt like something.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.170
It was so awesome
to have a following,

23:22.320 --> 23:24.641
and Harry, he was just...
He was so into it.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.889
Ed, you have to tell him.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.322
You don't get it.
We were the Thinman guys.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.164
Without the Thinman,
we're just guys...

23:31.320 --> 23:34.403
Just... we're just puffs.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.561
- What?
- What?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.731
If I tell Harry,
he's gonna leave the Ghostfacers.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.480
Listen, if you don't tell him,
he's gonna leave anyway.

23:43.840 --> 23:48.004
Trust me here.
Secrets ruin relationships.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.530
Okay, well, I'll just tell him
when the time is right.

23:56.640 --> 24:00.645
- Time's right now, chief.
- Well, he's... He's not here.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.967
He's out in the woods,
searching for Thinman.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.127
Okay, because Thinman,
or whatever the hell this thing is,

24:09.200 --> 24:12.249
has killed two people,
and now Harry is in the woods alone.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.250
Well, actually,
it's more like "wood,"

24:15.360 --> 24:18.728
'cause I dropped him off by some trees
behind a grocery store.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.560
Guys, come on.
He's gonna be fine.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.561
Guys?

24:26.120 --> 24:28.248
All right, what we have
here is a... it's a...

24:28.480 --> 24:34.010
It looks like a formation of sticks
in the shape of a pile.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.609
Could have been
left here for us by Thinman.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.808
What was that?

24:44.560 --> 24:45.607
Oh!

24:47.160 --> 24:49.766
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.288
Oh, my God.

24:54.920 --> 24:58.402
We are not alone.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.968
Too tight?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.204
Nope. No, I'm good.
I'm good.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.560
- Yeah? All right.
- I'm good.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.889
I think I'm just gonna have to staple it
when we get back to the motel.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.400
- We were right, Ed! Thinman's real.
- Yeah.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.130
Some fresh tires tracks
back over there.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.885
- I took some photos.
- What for?

25:54.480 --> 25:56.289
Because that car might belong
to whoever knifed you.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.370
Well, whoever cut me was Thinman,
and Thinman doesn't drive.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.563
It was Thinman, jackass!

26:04.160 --> 26:05.650
I mean, I shouldn't have to
connect the dots for you guys.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.764
I figured, you know,
you're both intelligent, maybe.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.566
- Um, Harry...
- What?

26:12.680 --> 26:15.843
Why didn't you tell me
that before?

26:16.440 --> 26:17.441
Because...
I don't know...

26:17.640 --> 26:19.210
I thought you were gonna get mad.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.291
Good guess, Ed.
I am mad.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.006
I'm really, really mad
at you right now.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.326
I can see that.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.569
You crashed the Jenga Tower
of our lives.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.206
I was gonna get married.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.843
I left her to run around with you,
living some lie.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.246
Well, at least we were
living it together.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.365
Seriously? Seriously?

26:40.520 --> 26:42.409
If I hadn't struck gold with Thinman,

26:42.560 --> 26:44.520
you'd be doing a boring job,
doing boring numbers,

26:44.640 --> 26:45.846
answering to Dana's dad.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.326
Okay? I saved you, bud.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.363
Saved me? From what?

26:50.240 --> 26:52.447
From living a nice life?

26:52.960 --> 26:54.371
From not getting stabbed?

26:54.440 --> 26:55.601
How selfish can you be?

26:55.840 --> 26:56.966
Well, maybe it's
not too late, you know?

26:57.160 --> 26:58.240
You could call her and see.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.721
- That's not gonna work.
- Well, maybe... Maybe it will.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.240
No, it's not.
You want to know why?

27:02.440 --> 27:03.965
'Cause she's got some guy's arm
wrapped around her neck,

27:04.160 --> 27:06.640
and it's "complicated", okay?

27:07.560 --> 27:10.321
Look, Harry, we didn't know from
the start if Thinman was real or not.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.605
I... okay, look, maybe I had
some inside knowledge.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.406
Okay, but does it
really make a difference

27:15.560 --> 27:16.880
if we keep it going for the fans?

27:17.320 --> 27:18.401
They'll never know.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.400
I'll know.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.885
You made a chump out of me, Ed.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.406
Harry, we can get through this.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.081
We just debunk Thinman

27:30.440 --> 27:32.727
and then we go back
to Ghostfacers.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.731
I can't.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.888
I can't trust you anymore, Ed.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.970
Come on, Harry.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.241
I get it.
You're pissed, okay?

27:56.480 --> 27:58.881
And... and you don't mean
what you say.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.806
But, Harry,
just tell me what you need.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.644
I'll go get some coffee, and...

28:11.080 --> 28:13.128
And you can stay here and chill.

28:25.960 --> 28:26.961
Hey.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.609
How did it go?

28:29.680 --> 28:34.288
It, um, went, uh... Um...

28:48.520 --> 28:49.965
Hey.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.966
You okay?

28:55.320 --> 28:58.608
I just got punched right in the feels.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.604
None of it was real, Sam.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.926
Ed was just pretending,
and now he wants me to pretend,

29:13.120 --> 29:15.851
like this is just something
I could get past.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.167
I know what you mean.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.889
Look, there are things
you can forgive,

29:24.080 --> 29:25.809
and there are things you can't.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.244
So, which one is this?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.921
That's something you got
to figure out for yourself.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.521
Hey.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.961
I got a bead on those tire treads,
if you want to...

29:50.400 --> 29:52.164
- What's up?
- So, the tires were only made

29:52.360 --> 29:53.521
for one kind of car.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.649
It's a 1989 Geo Metro.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.610
Town this small,
there's only one registered here.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.643
Deputy says it belongs
to a guy named Roger

29:59.760 --> 30:00.761
who works night security

30:00.960 --> 30:02.644
down at the mill
on the north side of town.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.885
So, this thing teleported,
but it has a job and car.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.520
- What are we dealing with?
- Let's go find out.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.046
Sam and Dean caught something,

30:27.400 --> 30:29.880
so they're gonna clean up
your mess.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.571
You're right. It is my mess.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.848
I should be the one out there
cleaning it up.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.526
You'd just make it worse.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.041
Oh, what?

30:39.240 --> 30:41.400
You were fine leaving Sam
and Dean before. Why not now?

30:41.440 --> 30:44.011
I don't want to be a
jellyfish spine anymore, Harry.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.451
- Jellyfish don't have spines.
- Exactly.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.284
Before the heartache,
before the lies,

30:49.480 --> 30:51.005
we set out
to help people, right?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.404
Yeah... Mostly.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.400
So, there's no reason
not to get out there

30:56.440 --> 30:58.363
and do what we
mostly set out to do.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.162
Harry, I... I can make this
right for the both of us.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.046
We can make it right.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.406
You mean you want
to come with me?

31:30.640 --> 31:32.960
I thought we said my partner
and I would take care of this.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.482
Look, guys, my boss is AWOL.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.681
We don't have a warrant.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.771
My ass is on the line
if this thing goes sideways.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.081
All right.
Just stay back.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.001
Always wanted to use these things.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.006
So, you're Thinman, huh?

32:24.560 --> 32:25.561
That would make sense
if it didn't look

32:25.760 --> 32:27.649
like you just ate a fat camp.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.204
Oh, God, Sam, make him stop.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.724
Hey, so, what's the deal?
What are you, Norwood?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.001
You a demon?

32:41.200 --> 32:43.040
I mean, how did you teleport
back at the diner?

32:43.400 --> 32:45.448
Team effort.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.810
So, there was no teleporting.

33:08.040 --> 33:11.726
Just a couple of douche bags
doing a Scream thing.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.923
Wait, I know who you are.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.686
You're the busboy from the diner.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.880
So, what, you just wanted
to kill your boss?

33:22.560 --> 33:24.085
Trey was a dick.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.601
And what about Casey?
What did she do?

33:26.920 --> 33:28.331
She wouldn't go out with me,
so I set her up

33:28.560 --> 33:31.689
with someone else...
My knife.

33:34.840 --> 33:37.286
Good one, Rog.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.727
I see the sheriff
didn't make it out of town.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.441
Well, he really should
have given me

33:43.600 --> 33:44.601
the time off I asked for.

33:44.800 --> 33:48.600
- So, you killed him?
- I didn't kill anyone.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.251
Roger did.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.771
He's the psycho.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.283
I'm the visionary.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.771
I don't blame you
for underestimating me.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.690
Everybody does.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.043
Fancy Fed, coming in here,

34:02.240 --> 34:04.720
treating me like a paper monkey
from the get-go.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.927
But I was Thinman the whole time.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.920
Do you have any idea
how good that felt?

34:13.600 --> 34:15.681
No, sicko,
I can't say that I do.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.600
Yeah, pretty boy doesn't know

34:17.639 --> 34:19.880
what it's like to feel invisible.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.484
To grow up in a town of
300 people and nobody sees you.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.529
They didn't see us.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.800
So, how did you two meet?

34:31.440 --> 34:34.170
- Wackjob.com?
-  No.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.400
Just a couple of schmoes
in an empty bar.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.007
We hit it off.
Turns out me and Rog...

34:40.360 --> 34:42.328
...we're both total
conspiracy-theory junkies.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.120
And then we found Thinman,
and, barn,

34:44.440 --> 34:46.283
we blew up all over
the message boards.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.603
So, what is this, then?
Some sort of a twisted cosplay?

34:49.800 --> 34:50.960
Cosreal.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.050
You know,
blogging was fun, but...

34:53.239 --> 34:55.049
But, let me guess,
you wanted something more.

34:55.239 --> 34:56.764
You realize
what you two jackasses

34:56.960 --> 34:59.884
are doing
doesn't make you Thinman.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.524
It makes you copycat killers.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.850
It makes me Thinman.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.371
And you're not
telling anyone I'm not...

35:10.200 --> 35:12.646
...'cause you'll be too dead to talk.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.845
Show time.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.644
You two are lucky ducks.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.809
You're the stars
of our best video yet.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.765
And when it goes viral...

35:24.200 --> 35:26.202
...everyone will know Thinman's real.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.968
And... Action!

35:38.160 --> 35:40.288
Wait, no, no, no. Don't!

35:55.440 --> 35:56.851
Harry...

36:15.280 --> 36:18.648
Oh, he got me!
He got me back!

36:19.760 --> 36:21.762
It's Scooby-Doo time, douche bag.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.089
Take off the mask.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.285
I know you're not Thinman.
You're just a "me-me".

36:27.720 --> 36:29.370
Ed, it's pronounced meme.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.683
- It's spelled m-e-m-e, though.
- The second "e" is silent. Yeah.

36:33.920 --> 36:39.609
You're a me-me. A man-meme,
and I invented you.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.850
Good to know.

36:45.520 --> 36:46.567
Oh, sh...

36:50.000 --> 36:51.923
I'm a lover of the classics, Ed.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.565
And what we have here
is a Frankenstein situation.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.289
I mean, wow, the creator.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.485
I mean, we were
gonna let one of you guys

37:00.640 --> 37:03.371
live to tell our story
but now...

37:03.920 --> 37:05.763
...once you two are dead,
there'll be no proof

37:05.960 --> 37:08.406
that Thinman was your brainchild.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.006
No.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.844
Wait, no! No! No!

37:39.080 --> 37:41.447
No, look. Look at me.
This is all my fault.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.287
Okay?
It's all my fault.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.564
I got enough bullets for both of you.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.520
- So, are we good in there?
- Yeah.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.611
With the Thinman footage
and the way I set the bodies,

38:23.800 --> 38:25.211
there should be enough
breadcrumbs to make it look

38:25.440 --> 38:28.046
like those two psychos
offed each other.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.721
They were just people, man.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.366
They weren't demons.
They weren't monsters.

38:35.560 --> 38:40.646
They... were just frickin' people.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.888
Yeah, well, like I said,
people are sick.

38:46.360 --> 38:50.251
So... Are we cool?

38:52.160 --> 38:54.242
I don't think we ever will be.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.287
I mean, you know,
we made it right.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.290
We beat the guys.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.086
This could be our shot to start
the old Ghostfacers again.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.283
I came here with you to finish
this thing with Thinman.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.051
I wasn't just
closing a chapter, Ed.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.250
It was the whole dang book.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.760
But you saved my life back there.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.451
- I killed a guy, Ed.
- He was a bad guy, Harry.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.285
He was a guy, Ed.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.568
Too many people have died
'cause of your crap.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.371
I've done all this crap for us.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.210
I don't know why
you don't see that.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.770
No.
No.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.250
You did this for you.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.771
Ed, there's a lot of things
I can forgive...

39:40.160 --> 39:41.491
...but this isn't one of them.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.848
So what does this mean about us?

39:47.080 --> 39:49.082
It means...

39:51.200 --> 39:53.282
It's complicated.

40:06.280 --> 40:08.851
Can I get a ride from you guys?

40:12.120 --> 40:13.690
Yeah, sure.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.046
Harry, you okay?

40:58.720 --> 41:00.324
Yeah.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.411
I mean, no.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.721
You roll with a guy so many years,

41:05.880 --> 41:08.008
you start to think he's always
gonna be next to you.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.565
Like, when you're old and
you're drinking on the porch,

41:13.000 --> 41:14.764
he'll be in
that other rocking chair.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.641
And then something happens,

41:16.840 --> 41:22.847
and you realize that other chair
has gone empty.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.246
You know what I mean?
