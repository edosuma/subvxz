00:34.786 --> 00:36.153
This is some party!

00:36.187 --> 00:37.588
Hideki's doing it right.

00:37.622 --> 00:39.390
He's doing it exactly right.

00:39.424 --> 00:42.259
This is one of the craziest
parties I've ever been to.

00:42.294 --> 00:44.562
And as you know,
I'm friend..I'm friendly.

00:44.596 --> 00:47.231
I'm friendsly with Shaun White.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.603
Oh, my God.

00:52.637 --> 00:55.673
Is that... Donna
Nicole Marie Banelli?

00:55.707 --> 00:58.909
Hey, Banelli, you got a lot
of nerve showing up here!

00:58.944 --> 01:00.444
WOMAN:
So what? So what?

01:00.478 --> 01:02.880
It's a free world.
So what?

01:02.914 --> 01:04.415
Excuse me, Stan.

01:04.449 --> 01:08.018
That's the bitch who gave all
my ideas to Michael Crichton.

01:08.053 --> 01:10.020
Hideki!
Happy birthday, man!

01:10.055 --> 01:11.655
You're doing it just right!

01:11.690 --> 01:13.157
This party,

01:13.191 --> 01:15.960
that double-breasted jacket
you're wearing with corduroys,

01:15.994 --> 01:17.328
the '70s pornography

01:17.362 --> 01:19.163
you're projecting
on the wall outside.

01:19.197 --> 01:20.531
These two things here.

01:20.565 --> 01:23.233
These are the last two
Etruscan urns in existence.

01:23.268 --> 01:26.670
Geez, Hide, how do you do it?

01:26.705 --> 01:30.007
You can have anything you want
if you just trust your gut.

01:30.041 --> 01:31.475
I don't always understand

01:31.509 --> 01:33.844
why my gut is telling me
to do something,

01:33.878 --> 01:38.616
but I always do it, because
it has never steered me wrong.

01:38.650 --> 01:40.417
(stomach grumbles loudly)

01:41.720 --> 01:44.088
Oh, my God,
you destroyed one of the urns!

01:44.122 --> 01:47.358
Making this one the
last one in existence.

01:47.392 --> 01:48.659
It's priceless now!

01:48.693 --> 01:50.427
Ha, that's right.

01:50.462 --> 01:52.563
Thank you, gut.

01:53.965 --> 01:55.265
So, what happened?

01:55.300 --> 01:56.634
Eh, wasn't her.

02:00.205 --> 02:03.974
And now, the final Lego
to complete our official entry

02:04.009 --> 02:06.944
into the tri-county
Lego competition!

02:06.978 --> 02:09.947
The four stages of Ron Howard.

02:09.981 --> 02:12.216
STEVE:
Opie, Richie Cunningham

02:12.250 --> 02:14.318
and Ron Howard,
the director <i>with...</i>

02:14.352 --> 02:15.886
and without hat.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.221
Not bad.

02:17.255 --> 02:19.957
I love it, and I still don't
know who Ron Howard is.

02:19.991 --> 02:21.425
What, are you an idiot?

02:21.459 --> 02:23.227
He's only one
of the most popular

02:23.261 --> 02:25.496
mainstream directors
of our time.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.231
Eh, Ron Howard's okay,

02:27.265 --> 02:28.666
but I prefer indie films.

02:28.700 --> 02:29.900
(sniffs)

02:29.934 --> 02:31.068
(sniffing)

02:31.102 --> 02:32.236
Wait a minute.

02:32.270 --> 02:33.637
Do you smell that?

02:33.672 --> 02:37.141
Corned beef, tongue,
whitefish salad.

02:37.175 --> 02:38.575
Oh, no.

02:38.610 --> 02:39.810
A deli platter.

02:39.844 --> 02:42.646
That can only mean one thing.

02:43.782 --> 02:46.250
Mom, who died?

02:46.284 --> 02:48.686
Schmuely.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.387
Uncle Ira?

02:50.422 --> 02:52.856
What are you doing here?

02:52.891 --> 02:54.258
How shall I put this?

02:54.292 --> 02:55.693
You're a child,

02:55.727 --> 02:58.395
and you're gonna remember this
for the rest of your life,

02:58.430 --> 03:00.798
so I want to make sure
I say this right.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.434
(shouting):
Your dad is dead!

03:03.468 --> 03:07.738
He's dead!

03:10.275 --> 03:12.242
Man, that Hideki does it right.

03:12.277 --> 03:13.977
What a perfect party.

03:14.012 --> 03:16.013
Well, not entirely perfect.

03:16.047 --> 03:18.082
The cake?
You noticed, too?

03:18.116 --> 03:20.150
ROGER: <i>Don't you hate it
when you're at a party</i>

03:20.185 --> 03:22.753
<i>and you have to wait, like,</i>
<i>forever for a piece of cake?</i>

03:22.787 --> 03:24.421
STAN: <i>Yeah, but they have
to cut the cake somehow.</i>

03:24.456 --> 03:25.889
<i>But what if they didn't?</i>

03:25.924 --> 03:27.444
<i>You mean, what if</i>
<i>they got enough cakes</i>

03:27.459 --> 03:29.560
<i>to give each and every</i>
<i>person their own entire cake?</i>

03:29.594 --> 03:31.462
<i>No, that's not what</i>
<i>I'm talking about at all.</i>

03:31.496 --> 03:34.531
<i>I mean, what if there was some</i>
<i>way to cut all the pieces...</i>

03:34.566 --> 03:35.933
ROGER and STAN:
<i>At the same time?</i>

03:35.967 --> 03:37.067
STAN:
<i>Like some sort of...</i>

03:37.102 --> 03:38.402
ROGER:
<i>Gridded wire blade system</i>

03:38.436 --> 03:39.937
<i>that could quickly</i>
<i>and conveniently...</i>

03:39.971 --> 03:41.572
<i>Dice the cake into</i>
<i>appropriately-sized pieces</i>

03:41.606 --> 03:42.873
<i>with one simple cut?</i>

03:42.907 --> 03:44.441
<i>Yes! It could even be</i>
<i>dishwasher-safe,</i>

03:44.476 --> 03:45.676
<i>and the wire blades could...</i>

03:45.710 --> 03:47.244
<i>Roll into the handles</i>

03:47.278 --> 03:49.079
<i>so it would fit in a kitchen drawer for...</i>
<i>Easy...</i>

03:49.114 --> 03:50.354
- <i>No...</i>
- <i>Nonsense...</i> - <i>Storage?</i>

03:50.381 --> 03:51.648
<i>We could call it</i>
<i>"Piece of Cake"</i>

03:51.683 --> 03:53.317
<i>because it makes</i>
<i>cutting a piece of cake...</i>

03:53.351 --> 03:54.718
<i>A piece of cake!</i>

03:54.753 --> 03:55.919
(Stan's stomach grumbles loudly)

03:55.954 --> 03:57.087
What was that?

03:57.122 --> 03:58.956
I think that
was... my gut.

03:58.990 --> 04:01.358
Oh, my God, this
is just like Hideki!

04:01.392 --> 04:03.327
If we listen to it,
we'll get rich!

04:03.361 --> 04:04.995
Do you really think
it could work?

04:05.029 --> 04:06.309
(Roger's stomach
grumbles loudly)

04:06.331 --> 04:08.232
I think someone does.

04:08.266 --> 04:09.433
(both stomachs grumbling
in harmony)

04:09.467 --> 04:12.169
They need to be together.

04:12.203 --> 04:13.737
(grumbling nearby)

04:13.772 --> 04:15.172
What's that?

04:15.206 --> 04:17.507
Need an investor?

04:18.976 --> 04:20.878
Oh, my God,
we're really doing this!

04:20.911 --> 04:22.579
I know, it's really
gonna happen!

04:22.614 --> 04:24.648
And the best part is we'll be...

04:24.682 --> 04:27.851
equal partners.

04:27.886 --> 04:30.788
With only a verbal contract
based on trust.

04:30.822 --> 04:33.590
What more is necessary
among friends?

04:33.625 --> 04:35.626
(maniacal laughter)

04:37.195 --> 04:39.196
(stomach growling intensifies)
(car alarm blaring)

04:45.336 --> 04:46.303
Snot?

04:46.337 --> 04:47.704
Wh-What are you doing here?

04:47.739 --> 04:49.373
Why aren't you
at your dad's funeral?

04:49.407 --> 04:50.707
I'm not going.

04:50.742 --> 04:53.544
You're not going
to your own dad's funeral?

04:53.578 --> 04:55.345
It's all the way in Stockton.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.747
And my mom isn't going.

04:56.781 --> 04:58.482
And besides,
I didn't even know him.

04:58.516 --> 05:01.118
At best, we were... "friendsly."

05:01.152 --> 05:03.554
Now, come on, we're gonna be
late for the Lego competition.

05:03.588 --> 05:04.721
Whoa, whoa.

05:04.756 --> 05:06.657
You're not going
to the Lego competition.

05:06.691 --> 05:08.792
Snot, if you don't go
to your dad's funeral,

05:08.827 --> 05:10.961
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

05:10.995 --> 05:12.830
Like when I cut off
my rat tail.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.832
Steve, this is not
a big deal to me.

05:14.866 --> 05:16.200
I really don't care.

05:16.234 --> 05:18.202
Because you're in denial.

05:18.236 --> 05:20.337
Hmm, how do I make this
clear to you?

05:22.207 --> 05:23.207
Opie!

05:23.241 --> 05:24.708
What the hell, Steve?

05:24.742 --> 05:25.709
New plan.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.311
Barry, how much gas you got?

05:27.345 --> 05:28.879
A half tank,
but it's a big tank.

05:28.913 --> 05:29.980
Why?

05:30.014 --> 05:33.383
Because we're going
to California.

05:33.418 --> 05:36.220
We're taking Snot
to his dad's funeral.

05:36.254 --> 05:38.255
I said I don't want to go.

05:38.289 --> 05:39.857
Snot, come on.

05:39.891 --> 05:41.358
You know what you
would do right now

05:41.392 --> 05:43.160
if this were one
of your indie movies.

05:43.194 --> 05:44.728
You'd drop everything
you were doing,

05:44.762 --> 05:47.331
hop in this car
and take a cross-country trip

05:47.365 --> 05:49.700
to your estranged
father's funeral.

05:49.734 --> 05:51.235
And you know
where your best friends

05:51.269 --> 05:53.370
in the whole world are gonna be?

05:53.404 --> 05:56.673
Right there beside you
every step of the way.

05:58.209 --> 06:00.944
I care about you way too much

06:00.979 --> 06:02.613
to let you miss something
this big.

06:02.647 --> 06:04.448
Fine, but I'm telling you,

06:04.482 --> 06:07.451
I'm gonna get to that funeral
and still not feel anything

06:07.485 --> 06:08.886
about my dad dying.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.222
I promise you, buddy,
by the time we get there,

and then he disappeared
completely.

07:36.894 --> 07:39.362

It wasn't until I got older
that I came to understand

that he did that because
he didn't care about me at a.

He didn't even care enough
to get me real Cheetos.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.335
You have to feel something!

11:06.370 --> 11:07.804
He was your dad.

11:07.838 --> 11:09.338
And now he's gone.

11:10.374 --> 11:12.408
We're all gonna die, Steven!

11:12.443 --> 11:14.010
I'm gonna die!

11:14.044 --> 11:15.378
You're gonna die!

11:15.412 --> 11:17.914
Everyone dies!
(thunder crashes)

11:17.948 --> 11:20.349
Do you really think any of this

11:20.384 --> 11:22.552
is going to last forever?

11:22.586 --> 11:24.153
'Cause it's not!

11:24.188 --> 11:26.556
Your dad's death
is tearing us apart!

11:28.225 --> 11:30.193
(grunting)

11:30.227 --> 11:32.829
(sobbing)

11:32.863 --> 11:36.399
We are all alone
in the universe.

11:36.433 --> 11:37.633
We are not alone!

11:37.668 --> 11:39.202
We're in this together!

11:39.236 --> 11:43.239
We are born alone
and we die alone.

11:43.273 --> 11:45.374
Why am I here?

11:45.409 --> 11:46.375
(thunder crashes)

11:46.410 --> 11:48.578
I don't know why I'm here.

11:48.612 --> 11:50.513
Wait a minute.
Where's Toshi?

11:50.547 --> 11:51.948
Toshi?

11:51.982 --> 11:54.117
Tosh!

11:57.521 --> 11:59.021
BARRY:
Toshi!

11:59.056 --> 12:00.923
Toshi, where are you?

12:00.958 --> 12:02.825
Toshi, please come back!

12:02.860 --> 12:05.528
Toshi!

12:11.735 --> 12:13.736
(panting)

12:15.506 --> 12:18.541
It's so hot in this corn.

12:18.575 --> 12:20.476
STEVE:
I found him!

12:28.585 --> 12:30.219
What are you talking about?

12:35.192 --> 12:37.059
Please go.

12:51.842 --> 12:54.076
The secret to
the "Piece of Cake" system

12:54.111 --> 12:56.112
is the real aluminum wire,

12:56.146 --> 12:58.147
which is spun to perfection
in China.

12:58.182 --> 13:00.249
Where they know
how to spin wire.

13:00.284 --> 13:01.918
This wire is safe to touch.

13:01.952 --> 13:03.920
You will not cut yourself
on this wire.

13:03.954 --> 13:05.988
This wire retracts into
the handles for easy storage.

13:06.023 --> 13:08.057
I could just go on and on
about this wire,

13:08.091 --> 13:09.392
but the real proof
is in the puddin',

13:09.426 --> 13:11.027
or the cake,
as I should have said,

13:11.061 --> 13:12.695
because we are about
to slice up some cake!

13:12.729 --> 13:13.763
I don't know about you,

13:13.797 --> 13:16.832
but I am glad I came
to work today.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.534
Now, just watch this.
Look at this.

13:18.569 --> 13:20.036
Watch and see how
amazing this is.

13:20.070 --> 13:21.437
Look! Look! Look! Look!

13:21.471 --> 13:22.872
Look at this!
Look at this! Look!

13:22.906 --> 13:25.641
Now, I've heard stories
of people running this system

13:25.676 --> 13:29.278
under hot water
and using it on ice-cream cake!

13:32.950 --> 13:35.084
We don't have time to
dillydally, so we're just

13:35.118 --> 13:36.552
going to get a room, shower up,

13:36.587 --> 13:38.788
and then get right back
on the road.

13:51.201 --> 13:52.602
Um, hi.

13:52.636 --> 13:54.837
Uh, can I help you
with your cello?

13:54.871 --> 13:56.806
No. It's my suitcase.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.541
I just don't think
all suitcases

13:58.575 --> 14:00.076
should be rectangles, you know?

14:00.110 --> 14:01.477
I think sometimes suitcases

14:01.511 --> 14:03.646
can be cello cases
with clothes in them.

14:04.982 --> 14:06.482
What are you doing here?

14:06.516 --> 14:08.784
I'm traveling cross-country
taking Polaroid pictures

14:08.819 --> 14:11.053
of people walking
other people's dogs.

14:11.088 --> 14:12.455
It's pretty hard to tell,

14:12.489 --> 14:13.889
but I didn't become an artist

14:13.924 --> 14:15.558
because it was easy.

14:15.592 --> 14:16.926
You're amazing.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.562
I'm actually a total dork.

14:19.596 --> 14:21.464
I got to get something to eat.

14:21.498 --> 14:23.299
I'm starving.

14:24.868 --> 14:27.503
(fluorescent lights humming)

14:34.144 --> 14:36.145
(coins clatter
into vending machine)

15:03.507 --> 15:08.678
Where were you?!
Where were you?!

15:08.712 --> 15:10.279
Where were you?!

15:10.314 --> 15:12.214
(sobbing)

15:28.065 --> 15:29.465
WOMAN:
Move.

15:29.499 --> 15:33.169
You can move that way
or you can move that way,

15:33.203 --> 15:35.204
but you got to move.

15:39.343 --> 15:41.544
You're right.

15:41.578 --> 15:43.913
I've been frozen inside.

15:43.947 --> 15:45.314
Stuck.

15:45.349 --> 15:46.349
Now I understand

15:46.383 --> 15:48.317
what Steve was trying
to do for me.

15:48.352 --> 15:50.519
I got to get to this funeral.

15:50.554 --> 15:52.521
I've got to move.

15:52.556 --> 15:53.889
Yes, move.

15:53.924 --> 15:55.358
I must clean.

15:55.392 --> 15:57.927
Frat boys poop all over room.

15:57.961 --> 16:00.129
And in the lobby!

16:00.163 --> 16:03.833
They only do this
'cause I Tri Delt.

16:08.023 --> 16:10.191
Yeah, so his dad is dead

16:10.225 --> 16:11.793
and we're heading
to the funeral.

16:11.827 --> 16:13.261
It's rough, because his dad

16:13.295 --> 16:15.196
was never really
there for him, so...

16:15.230 --> 16:17.432
you know,
it's-it's rough.

16:17.466 --> 16:19.534
He's also pretty poor.

16:19.568 --> 16:21.135
Well, with a friend like you,

16:21.170 --> 16:23.538
he's got more than most.

16:26.575 --> 16:28.376
(whispering): I'm gonna
leave this picture

16:28.410 --> 16:29.877
at a gas station.

16:34.683 --> 16:35.917
Steve, I get it now.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.086
I get why I have to go
to my dad's funeral.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.587
And I owe it all to you.

16:39.621 --> 16:40.688
That-that's great, buddy.

16:40.723 --> 16:42.390
And I want to talk all about it

16:42.424 --> 16:43.524
the minute you get back.

16:43.559 --> 16:45.560
Just you and me
in the buddy closet.

16:45.594 --> 16:48.930
You're not going with me
to my dad's funeral?

16:48.964 --> 16:51.499
I would love to,
but-but this girl,

16:51.533 --> 16:54.268
this-this incredibly
hard-to-define girl...

16:56.605 --> 16:58.005
I think she's the one.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.540
And that I would meet her now,

16:59.575 --> 17:01.376
while you're going
through your thing...

17:01.410 --> 17:03.010
what wonderfully
transformative time

17:03.045 --> 17:04.212
for both of us!

17:04.246 --> 17:05.279
But...

17:05.314 --> 17:06.781
(grunts) Life.

17:06.815 --> 17:08.383
Am I right?

17:13.388 --> 17:15.455
I can't believe Steve bailed

17:15.491 --> 17:17.258
after everything
we've been through.

17:17.291 --> 17:19.694
Thanks for being here
for me, Barry.

17:19.728 --> 17:21.396
Hey, I just feel good

17:21.430 --> 17:23.431
taking you to your
dad's funeral.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.013
♪

17:42.851 --> 17:45.987
I just realized
I don't know your name.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.221
I could tell you my name,

17:47.256 --> 17:48.556
but would my name tell you

17:48.590 --> 17:50.992
that I'm incapable
of seeing the color orange?

17:51.026 --> 17:53.828
I just have to trust people
who give me these.

17:53.862 --> 17:57.131
Or that I think mustaches
are T-shirts for lips?

17:57.166 --> 17:59.801
Or that I wear
ice skates to weddings?

17:59.835 --> 18:01.569
It's hard to dance.

18:01.603 --> 18:04.071
But that's just the
type of person I am.

18:06.542 --> 18:07.842
I'm Steve.

18:07.876 --> 18:09.544
I'm the kind of guy
who drives cross-country

18:09.578 --> 18:11.612
to take his friend
to his old man's funeral,

18:11.647 --> 18:13.448
then gives it all up
when he finds

18:13.482 --> 18:16.217
his manic, pixie dream girl
along the way.

18:16.251 --> 18:17.552
Wait a minute.

18:17.586 --> 18:19.153
You blew off your
grieving friend

18:19.188 --> 18:22.023
to hang out in a hot tub
with a complete stranger?

18:22.057 --> 18:23.024
No.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.625
No, you don't understand.

18:24.660 --> 18:26.761
I helped him get in touch
with his sadness.

18:26.795 --> 18:29.730
I'm the only reason
he even went to the funeral.

18:29.765 --> 18:31.799
Oh, I just figured you out.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.835
You're an emotional tourist.

18:36.705 --> 18:37.672
A what?

18:37.706 --> 18:38.940
You're the kind of person

18:38.974 --> 18:40.741
who feeds off
other's experiences

18:40.776 --> 18:43.277
to fill the void inside of you.

18:43.312 --> 18:44.512
An emotional tourist.

18:44.546 --> 18:45.813
And I'm sorry,

18:45.848 --> 18:47.748
