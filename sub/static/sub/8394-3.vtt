WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:02.998
- I'M WAITING FOR THIS WAVE
OF LOVE TO WASH OVER ME,

00:03.100 --> 00:04.510
AND IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING.

00:04.620 --> 00:08.033
- THIS IS THE START
OF OUR ACT THREE.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.937
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WANT TO SELL OUR HOUSE?

00:10.040 --> 00:12.144
- I THINK WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT IT.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.831
- I'M GONNA RUN FOR MAYOR
OF BERKLEY.

00:13.940 --> 00:17.239
- NOBODY'S EVER EVEN HEARD
OF KRISTINA.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.566
SHE'S NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE.

00:18.670 --> 00:19.876
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S RUNNING
FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

00:19.980 --> 00:20.969
I DON'T KNOW HOW REALISTIC
IT IS.

00:21.090 --> 00:22.352
- YOU GOT MY BACK,
RIGHT?

00:22.470 --> 00:24.426
- YEAH.

00:25.850 --> 00:30.913
[machine pumping]
- WOW.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.645
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:32.750 --> 00:33.739
[baby fusses]

00:33.860 --> 00:34.508
- STOP STARING AT ME
LIKE THAT.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.235
- I LITERALLY CANNOT
LOOK AWAY.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.682
- TRY.

00:37.790 --> 00:40.509
- THIS IS THE MOST FASCINATING
CONTRAPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN.

00:40.620 --> 00:42.269
IT'S PNEUMATIC
AND IT'S HYDRAULIC.

00:42.380 --> 00:44.484
THERE'S FLUID AND AIR.
IT'S--

00:44.590 --> 00:46.069
- IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT FASCINATING, OKAY?

00:46.180 --> 00:48.000
I FEEL LIKE A BIG OLD COW.

00:48.110 --> 00:51.864
A BIG, LACTATING,
UNSEXY, SLEEP-DEPRIVED COW.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.424
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVEN'T SLEPT

00:53.530 --> 00:55.669
MORE THAN 20 MINUTES IN A ROW
SINCE THAT THING CAME OUT OF ME.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.658
[baby screaming]

00:57.780 --> 01:00.010
SHE'S GO'I'I'A TAKE THIS BOTTLE.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,

01:00.120 --> 01:01.872
I-I REALLY NEED A BREAK,
OR ELSE I'M GONNA DIE.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.298
AND THEN, AT THAT POINT,

01:03.400 --> 01:04.367
MY BREASTS WILL NO LONGER
BE AN OPTION

01:04.470 --> 01:05.812
BECAUSE I WILL BE DEAD.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.504
- OKAY, SO YOU WANT ME TO HOOK--
I HOOK HER TO THIS?

01:09.620 --> 01:11.167
- NO.
- DOES IT HAVE, LIKE, A REVERSE?

01:11.270 --> 01:12.544
IT'S GOT A REVERSE BUTTON?

01:12.650 --> 01:14.277
- NO.
- OH, I'M GOING HERE. OKAY.

01:14.380 --> 01:15.301
- JUST GIVE HER TO ME.
- YOU GOT MORE IN THERE?

01:15.420 --> 01:20.960
- IT'S NOT--YEAH.
[baby crying]

01:21.080 --> 01:22.274
COME ON, COME ON.

01:22.390 --> 01:23.903
- YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL
RIGHT NOW.

01:24.010 --> 01:28.765
[baby crying]
YOU LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.326
- SHH...

01:31.430 --> 01:33.637
- THANKS FOR DOING THIS
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

01:33.740 --> 01:34.843
- OH, MY PLEASURE.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.292
- YOU'RE LITERALLY, LIKE,
THE ONLY PHOTOGRAPHER AVAILABLE.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.947
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, I MUST HAVE
CALLED, LIKE, 100 PEOPLE

01:38.060 --> 01:40.290
BEFORE I FOUND YOUR WEB SITE.
[glggleSJ

01:40.410 --> 01:41.092
- THAT MANY, HUH?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.191
YOUR WEB SITE--
BEAUTIFUL.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.686
THERE'S NO PEOPLE, THOUGH.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.997

IN PHO-DOG-RAPHY,SO...

01:47.100 --> 01:49.785

01:55.010 --> 01:58.343
YEAH, YOU LIKE THAT?

01:58.460 --> 02:00.769
- JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
TRIPLE-CHECK THAT LIST. OKAY.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.521
OKAY, AT 3:00 YOU HAVE
A PHONER WITH KAITLIN LONNER.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.039
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE.

- YEAH, SHE'S A LOCAL
BLOGGER.

02:06.780 --> 02:08.259
SITE GETS PLENTY OF TRAFFIC,
SO IT'S GOOD.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.225
PUT PENS ON THE LIST TOO.
WE NEED PENS.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.195
- PENS? I HAVE PENS.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.643
LIKE CAMPAIGN PENS.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LOVE FREE PENS.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.024
- SUCH A GOOD IDEA!

02:16.130 --> 02:17.472
WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTOR'S
OFFICE, I'M LIKE,

02:17.580 --> 02:18.956
"OH, THERE'S THE PEN."
IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER.

02:19.060 --> 02:20.334
- YOU WANT A FREE PEN, RIGHT?
- GOOD MORNING, HONEY.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.826
- MORNING, HONEY. HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M GOOD.

02:21.930 --> 02:22.612
COFFEE'S OVER THERE.
OKAY.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.470

OVER HERE.

02:23.590 --> 02:25.160
[doorbell rings]
IS THAT THE DOOR?

02:25.280 --> 02:26.486
OKAY, THAT'S PROBABLY
THE SHORT GUY.

02:26.590 --> 02:29.764
I'M GONNA GRAB IT, YOU GUYS
DO THE HUBBY-WIFE THING.

02:29.870 --> 02:30.962

02:31.080 --> 02:33.105

02:33.220 --> 02:34.289
SHE IS SO AMAZING.
I'M TELLING YOU,

02:34.390 --> 02:35.550
IF BOB KNEW
THAT SHE EXISTED,

02:35.670 --> 02:36.739
HE NEVER WOULD HAVE
HIRED ME, EVER.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.569
- HONEY, YOU ARE AN AMAZING
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.661
- OH, IT WAS FINE,
BUT SHE IS ON FIRE.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.042
LIKE, SHE'S ACTUALLY
MAKING ME THINK

02:42.160 --> 02:43.468
THAT I CAN DO THIS.

02:43.570 --> 02:45.014
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE
A MILLION BUCKS WITH HER.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.700
- SERIOUSLY,
THERE'S NO COFFEE?

02:46.820 --> 02:48.264
- ALL RIGHT, SO IT WASN'T
THE SHIRT GUY,

02:48.370 --> 02:49.644
BUT OUR JUICE IS HERE.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.332
- GOOD, WE HAVE EXTRACT JUICE,
BUT NO COFFEE.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.611
- I'LL PUT IT ON THE LIST.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.472
THE INTERN GUY'S GONNA
RUN OUT LATER AND GET IT.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.616
- WE HAVE A MEETING WITH THE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PEOPLE,

02:57.720 --> 02:59.688
AND THEY LIKE THEIR KALE
LIQUEFIED.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.028
CAN I GET YOUR CREDIT CARD,
KRISTINA?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.311
- UM...OH.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.694
[whispering]
GIVE HER YOUR CREDIT CARD.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.698
- MINE'S MAXED OUT.
- THAT'S NOT--

03:04.800 --> 03:06.722
THE DELIVERY CHARGE.
- NO, NO PROBLEM.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.353
- I HAD TO GET OFFICE SUPPLIES.
YOU KNOW HOW--

03:08.460 --> 03:09.381
- HERE YOU GO, HEATHER.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.593
- THANK YOU.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.420

YOU RUN OUT OF THINGS.

03:14.530 --> 03:16.009
- THERE'S YOUR COPY.
THERE'S YOUR CREDIT CARD

03:16.120 --> 03:16.973
AND YOUR RECEIPT.
- OKAY.

03:17.090 --> 03:20.321
- THE TIP IS INCLUDED.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.773
- I MIGHT NEED 20 BUCKS LATER
TOO FOR GAS, BUT...

03:23.890 --> 03:25.858
- REALLY?
$250 FOR JUICE?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.473
SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

03:34.730 --> 03:36.345
- AMBER, ARE YOU--

03:36.450 --> 03:38.315
- OOH! HI. HEY.

03:38.420 --> 03:40.001
HI.

03:40.110 --> 03:41.213

HANG ON.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.936
HI. COME IN. DON'T.
IT'S FINE.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.426
- I'LL LEAVE.
- COME IN HERE.

03:45.530 --> 03:46.940
SHH. IT'S FINE. WHAT'S UP?
- IT'S JUST MY ROOMMATE--

03:47.050 --> 03:49.974
I HAVE A CLASS AT 8:00,
AND MY ROOMMATE LOCKED ME OUT.

03:50.090 --> 03:52.320
HE PUT THE--

03:52.430 --> 03:54.011
HE PUT THE LACROSSE STICK
ON THE DOOR.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.813
- UH...
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?

03:55.920 --> 03:56.955
- I CAN'T GO IN THERE.
I DON'T KNOW--

03:57.060 --> 03:59.199
- OH, LIKE A TIE,
OR WHATEVER?

03:59.300 --> 04:01.507
- YEAH, IT'S--
- IT'S LIKE A--

04:01.620 --> 04:02.609
- YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE
TO SLEEP?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.540
- YEAH. NO. AND THEN I'M--
- DREW.

04:04.650 --> 04:05.787
- I CAN LEAVE.
- THAT'S--NO. STAY.

04:05.900 --> 04:06.992
JUST PUT YOUR STUFF DOWN.
STAY HERE. IT'S GREAT.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.203
- YEAH, AND I CAN GO--

04:08.310 --> 04:10.062
- DREW...
- DO YOU GUYS NEED SOMETHING?

04:10.180 --> 04:11.340
- DON'T GO BACK OUT THERE.
- YEAH.

04:11.450 --> 04:12.758
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING FOR BREAKFAST.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.417
- HONEY--
WE'LL GET BREAKFAST TOMORROW.

04:14.530 --> 04:15.838
IT'S FINE.
- YOU CAN TOTALLY STAY, MAN.

04:15.940 --> 04:17.032
- WE HAVE OUR WHOLE LIVES...

04:17.150 --> 04:18.833
- IF YOU NEED SOMETHING
FOR BREAKFAST OR WHATEVER...

04:18.940 --> 04:20.043
- WE HAVE STUFF. IT'S FINE.

04:20.150 --> 04:21.378
OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.489
- YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?
- I'M SORRY.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.396
- YOU WANT SOMETHING?
- SURE.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.947
- OKAY.
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

04:27.050 --> 04:28.085
[truck reverse alarm beeping]

04:28.190 --> 04:31.159
- THAT'S IT.
BRING HER BACK, MY MAN.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.431
GENTLY.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.100
BRING HER ON BACK.
COME ON.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.021
THAT'S IT.
YOU GOT PLENTY OF ROOM.

04:39.140 --> 04:42.098
COME ON BACK.

04:42.210 --> 04:45.099
GOOD, BILLY!
THAT'S IT.

04:45.210 --> 04:47.246
- WHAT IS THIS?

04:47.350 --> 04:49.079
- HUH?
- THIS.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.068
- THIS?
- YEAH?

04:51.180 --> 04:53.000
THIS--
COME HERE A MINUTE.

04:53.120 --> 04:59.218
THIS IS A 1965 PONTIAC GTO
CONVERTIBLE COUPE.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.605
NOW, YOU GOTTA USE
YOUR IMAGINATION,

05:01.710 --> 05:03.291
BUT UNDERNEATH ALL THIS DUST

05:03.400 --> 05:06.016
IS A BEAUTIFUL
METALLIC TEAL PAINT JOB.

05:06.130 --> 05:08.098
- WHAT'S IT DOING
IN OUR DRIVEWAY?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.646
NOT "IT." NOT "IT."
"SHE-ll

05:10.750 --> 05:11.739
WHAT'S SHEDOING HERE?

05:11.860 --> 05:13.168
OKAY, BILLY,
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

05:13.270 --> 05:14.089
LET HER DOWN.
LET'S UNHOOK HER.

05:14.210 --> 05:16.349
COME ON.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.099
ANYWAY, I GOT HER FROM WALTER
AT THE VET CENTER.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.201
- YOU BOUGHT IT?
WE OWN THIS?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.175
- SHE. WE OWN HER.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.488
I MEAN, IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.
DON'T THINK ABOUT THE MONEY.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.669
WALTER PRACTICALLY
GAVE HER AWAY.

05:27.770 --> 05:29.567
THE ONLY THING SHE NEEDS
IS A BRAND NEW ENGINE,

05:29.670 --> 05:30.386
AND THAT'S GONNA BE
THE FUN PART.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.115
- THAT'S A YEAR-LONG PROJECT.

05:32.220 --> 05:34.256
- NO, SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS TOPS.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.567
- THIS IS YOUR ANSWER,
RIGHT?

05:36.680 --> 05:39.399
I SAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
POSSIBLY SELLING THE HOUSE,

05:39.510 --> 05:41.330
AND YOU PULL A YEAR-LONG PROJECT
INTO THE DRIVEWAY?

05:41.440 --> 05:44.739
- WOULD YOU QUIT SAYING--
SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.168
COME ON, GIVE ME
SOME CREDIT HERE, GIRL.

05:46.270 --> 05:47.476
- HEY, DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM ME.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.207
- OKAY, BILLY, LET'S UNHOOK HER!
- JAKE.

05:49.310 --> 05:53.235
- COME ON.
ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

05:53.350 --> 05:56.729
MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:56.830 --> 05:59.344
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:59.460 --> 06:01.735
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

06:01.840 --> 06:04.001
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:04.120 --> 06:06.736
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:06.840 --> 06:08.159
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:08.260 --> 06:11.229
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:11.330 --> 06:13.844
FOREVER YOUNG

06:13.950 --> 06:16.464
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:16.580 --> 06:18.719
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:18.820 --> 06:21.232
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:21.340 --> 06:23.444
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:23.550 --> 06:26.235
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:26.350 --> 06:28.341
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:28.450 --> 06:30.315
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:30.420 --> 06:32.206
FOREVER YOUNG

06:32.320 --> 06:35.289
MAY YOU STAY

06:35.390 --> 06:38.769
FOREVER YOUNG

06:41.570 --> 06:43.606
- VICTOR'S READING SKILLS
AREN'T ANYWHERE NEAR

06:43.710 --> 06:45.086
WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.
- RIGHT.

06:45.190 --> 06:46.942
I KNOW HE'S A LITTLE BIT
BEHIND,

06:47.060 --> 06:49.221
BUT HE HAS, I MEAN,
MADE LEAPS AND BOUNDS

06:49.330 --> 06:51.742
SINCE HE'S LIVED WITH US.

06:51.850 --> 06:53.647
- I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES,

06:53.750 --> 06:55.854
AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO SPEAK WITH YOU BOTH FIRST

06:55.960 --> 06:58.713
BEFORE I MAKE ANY SORT
OF A RECOMMENDATION.

06:58.830 --> 07:00.855
- OKAY, WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
RECOMMENDATION FOR WHAT?

07:00.970 --> 07:02.346
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
VICTOR MIGHT BENEFIT

07:02.450 --> 07:05.248
FROM REPEATING
THE FOURTH GRADE.

07:05.350 --> 07:09.457
- YOU WANNA--
YOU WANNA HOLD HIM BACK?

07:09.560 --> 07:11.357
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO
DO ANYTHING HERE, NOW,

07:11.460 --> 07:13.872
EXCEPT OPEN UP A DIALOGUE.

07:13.980 --> 07:16.631
GENERALLY SPEAKING,
WE DON'T LIKE TO MOVE CHILDREN

07:16.740 --> 07:19.220
INTO A DIFFERENT CLASSROOM
UNLESS IT'S A LAST RESORT.

07:19.330 --> 07:20.251
- [sighs]

07:20.370 --> 07:23.157
I MEAN, WE READ WITH HIM
EVERY NIGHT,

07:23.270 --> 07:25.500
BUT MAYBE WE COULD READ--
DO A LITTLE MORE READING.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.783
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

07:27.890 --> 07:29.437
JULIA'S GOT SOME TIME OFF
FROM WORK.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.233
MAYBE YOU COULD.
- THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.446
I MEAN, I WAS GONNA SUGGEST
A TUTOR, BUT THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.518
I CAN GIVE YOU SOME EXTRA
READING ASSIGNMENTS

07:36.620 --> 07:38.269
AND EXERCISES.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.929
VICTOR IS REALLY A VERY,
VERY SWEET BOY.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.280
- MM-HMM.

07:43.390 --> 07:44.766
- I'D LIKE TO SEE
A LITTLE MORE EFFORT,

07:44.870 --> 07:49.045
BUT I THINK THAT'LL COME AS
HE GAINS MORE CONFIDENCE AND--

07:49.150 --> 07:51.323
- SO WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T IMPROVE?

07:51.430 --> 07:55.116
- LET'S JUST TAKE A BREATH...

07:55.230 --> 07:56.709
PUT THESE STRATEGIES IN PLACE.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.469
WE'LL SEE IF IT WORKS,
AND, UM,

07:58.580 --> 08:01.435
THEN WE'LL WORRY ABOUT
MAKING ANY DECISIONS.

08:01.550 --> 08:04.951
- THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.133
- ALL RIGHT,
GOOD ATTITUDE, ADAM.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.037
CUT THESE COSTS.

08:13.140 --> 08:14.767
- HI.
- YEAH.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.861
- CAN I WORK HERE?
THE WI-FI'S OUT IN MY BUILDING.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.528
- WOW, YOU GOTTA GET
A NEW SUPER.

08:18.630 --> 08:19.597
- I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.260
- YEAH, COME ON IN.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.566
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.490
- I AM WORKING ON KRISTINA'S
CAMPAIGN BUDGET.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.420
- DOESN'T SHE HAVE THE WOMAN
THAT DOES THAT?

08:27.540 --> 08:29.531
- YEAH, SHE'S GOT
A CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HEATHER.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.016
BUT IF I LET HER DO THIS,
WE'RE GONNA WIND UP

08:31.130 --> 08:31.949
IN THE HOLE FOR SURE.

08:32.060 --> 08:34.608
$600 FOR PENS!
DO WE REALLY NEED PENS?

08:34.720 --> 08:35.812
I DON'T THINK SO.
- I LOVE FREE PENS.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.955
- IS THAT GONNA MAKE YOU VOTE
FOR SOMEBODY?

08:37.060 --> 08:38.470
- SURE.
- WE'RE GONNA WIND UP BANKRUPT.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.719
- LOOK AT THIS.
$900 FOR HEAD SHOTS.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.060
GET A PHOTOGRAPHER TO TAKE
ONE PICTURE OF KRISTINA

08:43.170 --> 08:44.341
FOR THE LAWN SIGNS
AND ALL THE OTHER POSTERS.

08:44.450 --> 08:47.624
- UM...

08:47.730 --> 08:51.177
I'LL DO THE HEAD SHOTS.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.032
- SARAH, I MEAN...
- WHAT?

08:53.150 --> 08:54.310
- YOU'VE NEVER WORKED
WITH A HUMAN BEING?

08:54.430 --> 08:57.979
- [scoffs]
NOT PROFESSIONALLY.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.729
- WELL, I NEED A PROFESSIONAL.
THIS IS A CAMPAIGN...

08:59.840 --> 09:00.909
- I AM A PROFESSIONAL.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.499
- I JUST--
I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT WORKING,

09:02.610 --> 09:03.747
YOU KNOW, WITH FAMILY.

09:03.850 --> 09:04.817
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.773
- IS THAT WHY
YOU WENT INTO BUSINESS

09:05.890 --> 09:07.118
WITH YOUR BROTHER CROSBY,

09:07.230 --> 09:08.572
AND HIRED MY DAUGHTER
TO WORK THE FRONT DESK?

09:08.680 --> 09:10.159
- ALL RIGHT, POINT TAKEN.

09:10.270 --> 09:12.852
- MAYBE YOU JUST FEEL GOOD ABOUT
WORKING WITH THISFAMILY.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.302
- IF I'M GONNA BE SPENDING
CLOSE TO $1,000

09:14.410 --> 09:15.547
ON A PHOTOGRAPH FOR A CAMPAIGN--
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

09:15.650 --> 09:16.582
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DO IT FOR FREE.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.509
- FOR FREE? AS IN NO MONEY?
- YES.

09:17.620 --> 09:18.996
YES. I WANT THE SHOT.

09:19.110 --> 09:21.203
- SATISFACTION GUARANTEED?
- OF COURSE.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.517
- WE DON'T LIKE IT,
WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE? DEAL.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.483
- $100.
- $50.

09:24.590 --> 09:27.241
- FINE.
- OKAY, IT'S A DEAL.

09:30.570 --> 09:35.212
- [relaxed sigh]

09:35.330 --> 09:38.254
[baby crying]

09:41.160 --> 09:42.434
- I'M ON IT.
I'M TOTALLY ON IT.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.882
JUST YOU KEEP RELAXING.
[baby crying]

09:43.990 --> 09:45.958
- THANK YOU.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.687
- COME ON.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.992
[baby crying]
SWEETIE, SWEETIE.

09:52.100 --> 09:54.409
IT'S BREAST MILK.
YOU LIKE BREAST MILK.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.444
I'VE SEEN YOU ENJOYING BREAST--
IT'S JUST BREAST MILK.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.549
[baby crying]
YOU DON'T WANT IT.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.867
YOU DON'T WANT IT.

10:00.970 --> 10:03.530
COME ON, YOU STUBBORN
LITTLE STINKER.

10:03.630 --> 10:07.111
[baby crying relentlessly]

10:11.360 --> 10:13.009
- HEY, HONEY.

10:13.120 --> 10:13.677
- HI.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.839
- YOU LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.848
- I LOOK LIKE I SHOULD BE
OFFERING YOU PEANUTS

10:17.960 --> 10:19.188
AND AN IN-FLIGHT MAGAZINE.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.369
- THAT IS ONE SEXY
FLIGHT ATTENDANT RIGHT THERE.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.711
- HONEY, A MAYOR'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO LOOK SEXY.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.024
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK
"MAYORAL,"

10:25.140 --> 10:26.300
WITH MAYBE A HINT OF SEXINESS.
- WELL--

10:26.410 --> 10:30.176
- I FEEL LIKE I NEED
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE, YOU KNOW?

10:30.280 --> 10:33.249
- HEY, UH, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT HAVING SARAH

10:33.350 --> 10:33.839
DO YOUR CAMPAIGN PHOTO?

10:33.940 --> 10:36.317
- YOUR SISTER?
- YEAH.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.489
SHE SAID SHE'D DO IT
FOR FREE.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.761
50 BUCKS,
SO PRACTICALLY FREE.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.188
- BUT THIS PHOTO
HAS TO BE AWESOME.

10:41.290 --> 10:42.450
WE NEED A GOOD PROFESSIONAL
IMAGE.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.322
- SARAH WILL DO A GOOD JOB.
- HONEY...

10:44.430 --> 10:45.351
CHECK IT OUT.
- YEP.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.459
- HOT OFF THE PRESSES, OKAY?
- WE CAN DO THAT.

10:46.570 --> 10:48.629
- WE NEED A PROFESSIONAL.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.126
- WE DON'T NEED A PROFESSIONAL
PHOTOGRAPHER.

10:50.230 --> 10:51.743
IT'S GONNA COST $1,000.
WE'VE ALREADY SPENT $5,000

10:51.850 --> 10:53.533
ON THIS CAMPAIGN,
AND IT'S STRESSING ME OUT.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.026
- TECHNICALLY, THIS ISN'T
REALLY OUR MONEY.

10:55.130 --> 10:56.051
- OH, IT IS OUR MONEY.
- WE'RE GONNA GET REIMBURSED.

10:56.170 --> 10:58.195
- OH, IT'S OUR MONEY.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING

10:58.310 --> 11:00.517
THAT WE STOP SPENDING MONEY
ON YOUR CAMPAIGN.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.518
I'M JUST SAYING SLOW DOWN
UNTIL WE KNOW

11:01.620 --> 11:03.485
THAT THERE ARE SOME DONATIONS
COMING IN.

11:03.590 --> 11:04.659
- THERE ARE DONATIONS
COMING IN, OKAY?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.819
- TELL YOU WHAT.
- WHAT?

11:06.940 --> 11:09.909
- CAN I JUST SIT DOWN WITH YOU
JUST FOR A SECOND?

11:10.010 --> 11:12.001
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU
A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS

11:12.110 --> 11:14.874
WE CAN TRIM THE BUDGET.
- YOU WENT THROUGH MY BUDGET?

11:14.980 --> 11:15.423
WHY DID YOU--
- I DID.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.873
- FOR WHAT?

11:17.980 --> 11:20.289
- WE'RE SPENDING OUR MONEY
ON THE CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW--

11:20.400 --> 11:21.492
- ADAM, I KNOW THAT WE'RE
SPENDING OUR MONEY RIGHT NOW,

11:21.610 --> 11:23.669
BUT WE'RE GONNA
PAY OURSELVES BACK.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.509
- I JUST WANT TO PULL BACK
A LITTLE BIT

11:25.610 --> 11:27.123
UNTIL WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE
THE DONATIONS COMING IN

11:27.230 --> 11:29.642
TO COVER THESE EXPENSES, OKAY?
- THE DONATIONS ARE COMING IN,

11:29.750 --> 11:30.956
AND WE'RE GONNA RAISE
ENOUGH MONEY

11:31.060 --> 11:32.129
TO COVER ALL OF OUR EXPENSES.

11:32.240 --> 11:32.820
- OKAY, JUST STOP
FOR ONE SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

11:32.930 --> 11:34.477
- NO, YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF.

11:34.590 --> 11:35.818
- I'M SORRY I'M MAKING YOU MAD.

11:35.930 --> 11:36.612
THIS IS A REALITY CHECK.
- I GUESS SO IT'S...

11:36.730 --> 11:38.869
- YOU'RE A FIRST-TIME CANDIDATE.

11:38.970 --> 11:40.756
- AM I REALLY?
- YOU'RE LATE TO THE RACE.

11:40.870 --> 11:41.768
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE

11:41.870 --> 11:42.962
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO COME UP

11:43.080 --> 11:44.479
WITH ENOUGH DONATIONS
TO COVER THESE EXPENSES.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.977
- I DON'T THINK THAT I KNOW
THAT BOB LITTLE WANTS TO SEE ME,

11:47.080 --> 11:48.490
LIKE, CRASH AND BURN,
AND THAT I'M A FIRST-TIME

11:48.600 --> 11:51.251
POLITICAL CANDIDATE, AND THIS IS
GONNA BE A TOUGH RUN FOR ME?

11:51.360 --> 11:52.941
YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT, ADAM?

11:53.050 --> 11:54.187
- OKAY.
- NO, HOLD ON A SECOND.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.110
WHEN YOU WANTED TO OPEN UP
THE LUNCHEONETTE,

11:56.230 --> 11:58.562
I SUPPORTED YOU 100%,
AND IT WAS TEN TIMES CRAZIER,

11:58.680 --> 12:00.011
AND TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN THIS.

12:00.130 --> 12:02.121
- IT'S WORKED OUT, OKAY?
AND BY THE WAY, AT THE TIME,

12:02.230 --> 12:03.436
YOU CALLED ME NUTS.
- I DID CALL YOU NUTS.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.609
BUT I SUPPORTED YOU.
- AND I'M SUPPORTING YOU.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.029
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP OUT.
- I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED YOU.

12:08.140 --> 12:10.279
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE US
GET INTO FINANCIAL TROUBLE HERE.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.540
KRISTINA, THAT'S ALL I'M DOING.
- YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ME

12:11.660 --> 12:13.685
IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.553
THANK YOU, BUDGET BOY.

12:16.660 --> 12:18.582
- "BUDGET BOY."
GREAT.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.907
[sighs]

12:32.060 --> 12:34.221
- I HAVEN'T SLEPT.
- OH.

12:34.330 --> 12:36.503
- I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS VICTOR SITUATION.

12:36.610 --> 12:38.020
- OH...

12:38.130 --> 12:40.121
- YOU KNOW,
MISS MIKINDOE IS RIGHT?

12:40.240 --> 12:43.209
HIS READING LEVEL IS NOT UP TO
A FIFTH GRADE READING LEVEL.

12:43.310 --> 12:44.754
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN
FOURTH GRADE READING LEVEL,

12:44.860 --> 12:45.895
IF WE'RE BEING HONEST
WITH OURSELVES.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.342
- WHICH IS WHY SHE WANTED
TO HAVE US IN

12:47.450 --> 12:48.758
TO TALK ABOUT READING
WITH HIM MORE.

12:48.870 --> 12:51.452
- BUT I'VE BEEN READING
WITH HIM CONSTANTLY.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.653
- OKAY, WELL, MAYBE I CAN
COME HOME FROM WORK

12:53.770 --> 12:55.146
A LITTLE EARLY
A COUPLE NIGHTS A WEEK.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.660
AND IF I CAN'T DO THAT,
THEN WE'LL FIND A TUTOR FOR HIM.

12:56.770 --> 12:59.898
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH MORE WE CAN DO...

13:00.020 --> 13:01.328
REALLY, THAT WE HAVEN'T
ALREADY DONE.

13:01.430 --> 13:02.943
WE HAVE DONE IT,
AND IT HASN'T WORKED.

13:03.050 --> 13:06.702
AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE HAVE.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.048
I MEAN...
GOD, HE'S GONNA BE

13:08.160 --> 13:09.912
IN THE SAME GRADE AS SYDNEY,
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW

13:10.030 --> 13:11.099
HOW TO BEGIN TO TACKLE THAT.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.599
- JULES, WE'RE NOT EVEN
THERE YET.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.950
- WE--HOW CLOSE TO THERE
DO WE HAVE TO BE?

13:15.070 --> 13:17.379
SHE SAID SHE WANTS
TO HOLD HIM BACK, BASICALLY--

13:17.480 --> 13:18.686
THAT SHE WAS WAITING
BECAUSE OF, YOU KNOW,

13:18.790 --> 13:20.655
HIS SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES,
WHICH IS--

13:20.760 --> 13:23.684
EHH, I HATE THAT.
- OKAY.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.792
JUST LET'S...
DEEP BREATHS HERE.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.289
WERE WE EVEN
IN THE SAME CONVERSATION?

13:29.390 --> 13:30.106
YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD?

13:30.220 --> 13:30.834
I HEARD A TEACHER TELLING US

13:30.940 --> 13:34.068
THAT WE GOT A GOOD KID.

13:34.190 --> 13:35.908
CAN WE TAKE OUR FINGER OFF
THE NUCLEAR LAUNCH BUTTON?

13:36.020 --> 13:41.253
- I'M NOT GIC'NING NUCLEAR.

13:41.370 --> 13:43.986
GOING A LITTLE...NUCLEAR.
- GOING A LITTLE NUCLEAR.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.261
- THAT'S OKAY.
- BUT--

13:45.370 --> 13:46.359
- IT'S A TOUGH CONVERSATION
TO HAVE,

13:46.480 --> 13:48.163
BUT THAT'S ALL IT WAS--
A CONVERSATION.

13:48.270 --> 13:52.855
- IT WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT
HOLDING OUR KID BACK A YEAR.

13:56.380 --> 13:58.063
- ALL RIGHT.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.495
- HEY, BERTO.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.875
- NICE ROBE, ROOMMATE.

14:11.980 --> 14:15.564
HEY, SO I MIGHT NEED
SOME PRIVATE TIME TONIGHT.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.127
IT'S NOT 100% YET,
BUT I GOT A STRONG FEELING.

14:19.230 --> 14:22.882
- OKAY, UM, ACTUALLY,
I HAVE A CLA--

14:23.000 --> 14:23.568
HEY, NATALIE.

14:23.690 --> 14:26.898
- OH, UH, HI...

14:27.000 --> 14:28.888
GUY FROM ACROSS THE--
DREW. RIGHT.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.039
- YEAH. HEY.
- HEY.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.007
- WE HAVE THE SAME
SHOWER CADDY.

14:36.110 --> 14:37.862
- [chuckles]
LOOK AT THAT. YEAH.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.595
CRAZY SMALL WORLD.
- YEAH.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.452
UM...

14:43.770 --> 14:45.909
THE LINE, IT'S--

14:46.020 --> 14:49.296
IS A--JUST WAIT UNTIL
THE LINE'S KINDA...

14:49.400 --> 14:51.436
- NICE WORK, DUDE.
- SEE YA.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.100
- HANK, CAN I BORROW
THE FLAG STAND?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.269
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY ASKING

14:55.370 --> 14:57.406
'CAUSE IT'S ALREADY IN THE CART,
RIGHT? SO...

14:57.510 --> 14:58.989
- HANK, CAN I BORROW
THE FLAG STAND

14:59.100 --> 15:00.067
THAT I ALREADY HAVE
IN THE CART?

15:00.170 --> 15:03.037
- YES. BUT IF
ONE OF YOUR DOG CLIENTS

15:03.140 --> 15:04.823
DOES SOMETHING ON IT,
I'M GONNA WANT A NEW ONE.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.932
- THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.031
UH, MY CLIENT TOMORROW
IS NOT A DOG.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.552
IT IS A REAL LIVE
HUMAN BEING.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.695
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.313
- IS IT
AGAINST THEIR WILL, OR--

15:14.430 --> 15:16.318
- THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
IN FACT,

15:16.430 --> 15:17.738
MY CLIENT IS VERY PRESTIGIOUS.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.761
IT'S A MAYORAL CANDIDATE.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.939
- OH, YEAH, I GOT IT.
- YEAH.

15:21.050 --> 15:24.087
- YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW, RIGHT?
YEAH, RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.886
- SO? DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT,
LIKE THAT'S NOT A REAL JOB.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.878
IT'S A REAL JOB.
SHE'S STILL RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.924
I'M EXCITED.
YOU COULD BE EXCITED FOR ME.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.122
- I AM. IT'S EXCITING.
- THANKS.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.128
- YOU WHAT WOULD BE EXCITING?
MAKE SOME MONEY,

15:34.240 --> 15:36.208
AND MAYBE YOU BUY
SOME EQUIPMENT.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.299
[phone ringing]
- OH, LOOK AT THIS.

15:37.410 --> 15:40.959
THE REPRESENTATIVE
OF MY FAMOUS CLIENT.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.311
HI, ADAM.
- YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW, YOU MEAN.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.526
- YEAH.

15:46.630 --> 15:50.418
OH.

15:50.530 --> 15:52.327
REALLY?

15:54.710 --> 15:57.178
NO, I DO GET IT.
THANK YOU.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.779
I'LL TALK TO YOU
ABOUT IT LATER.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.429
NO, THANKS FOR CALLING.
OKAY, BYE.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.193
UM, KRISTINA DECIDED
SHE WANTS SOMEBODY

16:07.310 --> 16:08.789
WITH MORE EXPERIENCE.

16:08.890 --> 16:11.688
- GET THE NEXT ONE, THEN.
ALL RIGHT?

16:11.790 --> 16:14.679
- YEAH.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.860
- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN PASSED
OVER SO MANY TIMES ON JOBS,

16:17.970 --> 16:19.619
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

16:19.730 --> 16:20.833
- YEAH, BUT YOU GET PASSED OVER

16:20.940 --> 16:23.249
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A WEIRD PERSONALITY.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.930
BUT...
- THAT'S TOTALLY NOT TRUE.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.904
- ANYWAY,
THIS IS MY FAMILY,

16:27.020 --> 16:29.739
AND THEY'RE JUST NOT EVEN
TAKING ME SERIOUSLY.

16:29.850 --> 16:32.944
- WHY WOULD THEY?
REALLY.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.561
NO, I MEAN--I MEAN--
- NO, NO.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.329
JUST DON'T SUGARCOAT IT.
- NO, NO, NO.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.262
LOOK, WHEN I MET YOU, YOU WERE
A PLAYWRIGHT...SOMETHING,

16:40.370 --> 16:42.850
AND THEN A...A...GRAPHIC--

16:42.960 --> 16:44.302
YOU DID STUFF WITH--
- GRAPHIC DESIGNER.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.093
- YEAH, YOU WERE THAT TOO.
- I DID THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

16:46.210 --> 16:48.440
- BUT YOU WERE...FLIGHTY.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.825
THEY DON'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY
BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.896
- [scoffs]
- SO THAT'S NOT AN INSULT.

16:53.010 --> 16:55.899
I'M JUST SAYING
STRANGERS DON'T KNOW YOU.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.932
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
- I KNOW.

16:58.050 --> 17:01.144
- WORKING WITH FAMILY IS--
IS HELL.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.773
STRANGERS DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.939
YOU GOT A CLEAN SLATE.

17:05.050 --> 17:08.224
- WELL, YOU KNOW ME.
DO YOU TAKE ME SERIOUSLY?

17:09.990 --> 17:12.265
OH...OKAY.

17:12.370 --> 17:14.258
- OKAY WHAT? LET ME ANSWER.
- NO, YOU PAUSED.

17:14.370 --> 17:15.951
THE PAUSE SAYS IT ALL.
- I PAUSE ON EVERYTHING.

17:16.060 --> 17:17.231
- NO, NO. NOT THAT KIND.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.819
- I GOT A--
- DON'T TRY TO FIX IT.

17:18.930 --> 17:20.204
I'VE GOTTA GO.

17:20.310 --> 17:21.277
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.199
- WHAT?

17:22.310 --> 17:23.299
- YOU GET A LITTLE FLIGHTY
WITH--

17:23.420 --> 17:24.614
- I'M NOT GETTING FLIGHTY.

17:24.730 --> 17:26.277
I'M EXITING. I'M LEAVING.
- YOU KNOW,

17:26.390 --> 17:27.869
SOMETIMES YOU PAUSE
FOR EFFECT.

17:27.970 --> 17:29.312
- I'LL JUST TALK TO YOU LATER.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.524
- THIS IS FLIGHTY,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

17:31.630 --> 17:33.245
[door opens]

17:33.360 --> 17:34.349
HMM.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.940
- IF I CHOOSE MY STATE PROJECT
ON HAWAII,

17:37.050 --> 17:39.735
DOES THAT MEAN WE COULD
TAKE A TRIP THERE?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.294
- VICTOR, YOU KNOW WHAT?
STATES ARE NOT ASSIGNED

17:41.400 --> 17:42.537
FOR ANOTHER MONTH OR SO,

17:42.640 --> 17:45.017
SO LET'S JUST FOCUS
ON THE WORK YOU HAVE NOW.

17:45.130 --> 17:45.880
- LIKE THE READINGS
WE WERE DOING.

17:45.990 --> 17:47.981
WE GOT THROUGH TWO CHAPTERS

17:48.100 --> 17:50.125
OF ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS
LAST NIGHT.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.161
- THAT'S GREAT.
- YEAH.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.953
- WERE YOU GUYS
TRADING OFF READING,

17:53.070 --> 17:56.369
OR JUST DAD?
- DAD READ.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.869
- VICTOR FOLLOWED ALONG, THOUGH.
- OKAY.

17:58.970 --> 18:02.098
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE BOOK?

18:03.870 --> 18:05.144
WELL, WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.047
- IT'S...
[exhales]

18:07.150 --> 18:09.380
- VICTOR,
YOU READ TWO CHAPTERS?

18:09.500 --> 18:10.831
YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE
TO TELL ME WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

18:10.950 --> 18:14.499
- IT WAS ABOUT, LIKE, OTTERS,
AND DUMB STUFF LIKE THAT.

18:14.610 --> 18:16.054
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THE MAIN CHARACTER?

18:16.160 --> 18:18.196
- OKAY, IT'S TIME
TO BRUSH TEETH.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.086
YOU GUYS, I'M DRIVING YOU TODAY,
SO GET GOING.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.747
- OH.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.307
- COME ON.
- HMM.

18:26.790 --> 18:29.782
[knock on door]
- HELLO?

18:29.900 --> 18:30.992
- OH, HEY.
- HI.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.099
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW YOU DOING, STRANGER?

18:32.210 --> 18:34.371
- DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
- OF COURSE I DO.

18:34.490 --> 18:35.388
- I'M SURE YOU'RE REALLY BUSY.
- I AM A LITTLE--

18:35.490 --> 18:36.934
- WOW.
- JUST GETTING THINGS UNDERWAY.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.076
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
- THAT'S AMAZING.

18:39.180 --> 18:41.148
IT LOOKS INCREDIBLE.
- IT'S SO FUN.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.899
- YEAH.
- I JUST GOT THE BALLOONS DONE.

18:43.010 --> 18:45.456
- GREAT.
- AND THE CAMPAIGN SIGNS.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.253
SO EVERYTHING'S
COMING TOGETHER.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.772
- KRISTINA, I BELIEVE IN YOU.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.814
AND WHILE I KNOW THAT
YOU HAVEN'T CHOSEN ME

18:51.920 --> 18:53.228
AS YOUR PHOTOGRAPHER YET,

18:53.330 --> 18:55.400
I ALSO KNOW THAT
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN

18:55.510 --> 18:57.330
SOME OF MY MOST RECENT WORK,
AND I THOUGHT

18:57.440 --> 18:59.476
MAYBE IF YOU SAW IT,
YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND.

18:59.580 --> 19:00.888
- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOUR--
YEAH, OF COURSE.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.060
- NOW, THIS IS WAFFLES,
BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO SEE

19:04.170 --> 19:05.967
IS JUST HIS EYES,
AND THE WARMTH...

19:06.070 --> 19:08.447
- YEAH.
- AND INTELLIGENCE...

19:08.560 --> 19:09.891
- SEEMS LIKE A NICE DOG.
- IN HIS EYES.

19:10.010 --> 19:13.286
THIS CAT WAS CROSS-EYED,
SO IT'S NOT THE BEST EXAMPLE.

19:13.390 --> 19:15.733
AGAIN, IT'S JUST CAPTURING
PERSONALITY.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.900
WHAT I KNOW I CAN DO BETTER
THAN A STRANGER

19:19.010 --> 19:21.319
IS CAPTURE YOU.

19:21.430 --> 19:24.558
- SARAH, LISTEN...
- WHAT'S STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL...

19:24.680 --> 19:26.568
- I LOVE HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE.
- AND SMART ABOUT YOU.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.295
AND I CAN GET THAT.
- THANK YOU.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.675
I LOVE HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE,
BUT I--

19:30.790 --> 19:33.543
I HAVE TO HAVE--

19:33.650 --> 19:34.958
I JUST NEED A PROFESS--
- I UNDERSTAND.

19:35.070 --> 19:39.586
- I NEED SOMEONE THAT HAS
DONE IT SO MANY TIMES BEFORE.

19:39.690 --> 19:41.829
- OR DO YOU NEED SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS YOU SO WELL

19:41.930 --> 19:43.932
THAT THEY CAN BRING OUT
WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG

19:44.040 --> 19:46.099
AND SMART ABOUT YOU?

19:46.210 --> 19:49.179
I WOULD ARGUE
I'M THAT PERSON.

19:49.290 --> 19:51.246
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE, BUT--

19:51.360 --> 19:52.588
- THIS HAS TO BE MY ONE SHOT.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.076
I GET ONE SHOT AT THIS PHOTO.

19:54.190 --> 19:56.158
I HAVE TO BRING IT TO THE
PRINTERS BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.808
- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SHOT
FOR ME TOO.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.251
[exhales]

20:03.540 --> 20:04.575
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

20:04.680 --> 20:06.545
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
I'M GONNA WIN.

20:06.650 --> 20:08.880
- WELL, I'M NOT ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE.

20:10.170 --> 20:14.960
- THANK YOU. UM...

20:15.070 --> 20:15.968
OKAY.

20:16.070 --> 20:18.061
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

20:18.180 --> 20:20.557
WHY NOT?
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.173
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
I SWEAR, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

20:22.290 --> 20:25.453
I WOULDN'T DO THIS IF I DIDN'T
THINK I COULD DO IT 100%, OKAY?

20:25.560 --> 20:26.731
- LET'S DO IT.
LET'S DO IT.

20:26.840 --> 20:27.909
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:28.010 --> 20:29.216
- THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.987
- JULIA.

20:37.090 --> 20:39.081
JULIA?

20:39.200 --> 20:41.361
HEY.
- HI.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.368
- HOW YOU DOING?
TOOK A LITTLE TRIP THERE, HUH?

20:43.480 --> 20:46.404
- YEAH. I'M SORRY,
I'M A LITTLE OUT OF IT.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.306
- YEAH.
- OH...

20:48.410 --> 20:49.377
- ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA--

20:49.480 --> 20:51.448
- UH, NO, NO, NO.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.312
I'M SORRY.
I'M FINE.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.526
I MEAN, I'M NOT FINE,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.905
- WELL, I'M ASSUMING YOU WEREN'T
IN BORA BORA

20:59.010 --> 21:01.979
JUST NOW, HUH?

21:02.080 --> 21:05.288
- VICTOR'S TEACHER IS TALKING
TO US ABOUT HOLDING HIM BACK.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.016
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.327
PLEASE, JUST KEEP THAT
TO YOURSELF.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.670
- YEAH. NO, I'M--
I'M SORRY.

21:12.780 --> 21:14.884
I WOULD NOT SAME/IMYTHING AT ALL.

21:14.990 --> 21:16.787
- THAT'S--
THAT'S ROUGH.

21:16.890 --> 21:17.743
- WELL, THAT'S WHERE
I WAS GOING.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.919
I MEAN,
PLAYING OUT THE SCENARIOS.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.476
KEEP HIM IN FIFTH GRADE, DO I
PUT HIM BACK IN FOURTH GRADE?

21:22.590 --> 21:24.751
DO I HOME SCHOOL HIM?

21:24.860 --> 21:25.895
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.581
- SO IT'S NOT, LIKE,
DEFINITELY HAPPENING?

21:27.700 --> 21:29.383
- NO. SHE JUST WANTED
TO OPEN THE CONVERSATION.

21:29.490 --> 21:30.718
- OH.
- SO WE'RE STILL WAITING TO SEE.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.000
- GOD, I HATE IT WHEN SCHOOLS
SAY CRAP LIKE THAT

21:32.110 --> 21:34.146
BECAUSE IT'S--YOU EITHER
DO IT OR DON'T DO IT.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.730
BUT EVERY SECOND
THAT YOU KEEP WAITING,

21:36.840 --> 21:38.899
THE POOR KID IS GETTING
MORE SETTLED IN THE FIFTH GRADE.

21:39.020 --> 21:41.875
IT'S STUPID.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.082
WOW, THAT IS SO
NOT MY PLACE TO SAY.

21:43.190 --> 21:47.058
- NO, NO.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.957
HUH.

21:49.060 --> 21:53.303
- DICK CHENEY
FAILED OUT OF YALE...TWICE.

21:53.410 --> 21:54.786
- [chuckles]

21:54.890 --> 21:55.891
NOT REALLY SURE WHERE
YOU PUT THAT

21:56.000 --> 21:57.854
ON YOUR PRO/CON LIST, THOUGH.
- EXACTLY.

21:57.970 --> 22:00.302
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I HAVE
A PRO/CON LIST?

22:00.420 --> 22:01.819
- OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE A FORMER LAWYER.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.339
DENGRA|_= AND PROSSLER?
[CIICKS tongue]

22:03.460 --> 22:05.621
YOU'VE TOTALLY GOT
A PRO/CON LIST.

22:05.730 --> 22:07.311
- I'VE TOTALLY GOT
A PRO/CON LIST.

22:07.420 --> 22:08.864
- YES, YOU DO.
ALL RIGHT, PRO/CON LIST THING?

22:08.980 --> 22:10.902
- YES.
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

22:11.010 --> 22:11.328
CONS.
- CONS.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.319
- BERTO, HEY.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.227
- WHAT'S UP, DUDE?
- DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

22:16.330 --> 22:19.254
- WHAT'S UP, BRO?
- UM...

22:19.370 --> 22:23.500
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THE, UM--

22:23.610 --> 22:24.713
ARE THOSE MY SHEETS?

22:24.820 --> 22:26.924
- OH, YEAH.

22:27.030 --> 22:29.089
YEAH, I WAS OUT,
AND YOURS WERE THERE. WHY?

22:29.200 --> 22:31.202
ARE YOU NOT COOL WITH THAT?

22:31.310 --> 22:34.108
- NO. NO, I'M NOT.

22:34.210 --> 22:37.509
AND ALSO, YOU KNOW,
PUTTING THE STICK ON THE DOOR,

22:37.630 --> 22:40.178
I--I KEEP GETTING LOCKED OUT.
I HAVE AN 8:00 AM. CLASS.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.520
I CAN'T--
- DUDE, THAT'S ROUGH.

22:41.630 --> 22:43.279
CAN I GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE?

22:43.390 --> 22:46.211
NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS, GO OUT
AND KNOCK ON A GIRL'S DOOR.

22:46.330 --> 22:49.595
LIKE THAT GIRL
FROM THE BATHROOM

22:49.710 --> 22:50.734
THAT YOU'RE SO HOT FOR.

22:50.850 --> 22:52.909
- WHAT, NATALIE?

22:53.020 --> 22:54.772
- GO UP TO HER DOOR
AND BE ALL, LIKE,

22:54.890 --> 22:57.848
"MY JACKASS ROOMMATE
JUST SEXISLEDME."

22:57.960 --> 23:00.611
AND THEN SHE'LL BE ALL, LIKE,
"AWW, YOU POOR THING.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.756
COME IN HERE SO I CAN
COMFORT YOU."

23:02.860 --> 23:05.920
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

23:06.030 --> 23:08.828
HOPEFULLY, IT WON'T HAPPEN
AGAIN, DO YOU KNOW?

23:08.930 --> 23:11.205
- BRO...
- WHAT?

23:11.320 --> 23:14.619
- GOOD TALK, DUDE.

23:16.290 --> 23:18.622
- PBBBT.

23:18.740 --> 23:21.595
I DON'T KNOW, TO ME,
IT'S JUST REALLY STRANGE.

23:21.710 --> 23:24.634
IT'S--I DON'T LIKE IT.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.116
- WELL, IT'S UNCONVENTIONAL,

23:26.230 --> 23:29.950
BUT THE LACTATION CONSULTANT
SAID THE BABIES RESPOND

23:30.060 --> 23:33.336
TO THE NATURAL NIPPLE FEEL,
YOU KNOW?

23:33.440 --> 23:36.500
MAYBE NOT EVEN--
- HAVE YOU TRIED ALL THIS STUFF?

23:36.620 --> 23:37.951
- DAD, I'M WILLING
TO TRY ANYTHING.

23:38.070 --> 23:39.583
WE ARE SO DESPERATE
AT THIS POINT.

23:39.690 --> 23:42.682
THE BABY WILL NOT STOP CRYING
UNLESS SHE'S BREASTFEEDING

23:42.800 --> 23:45.416
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE
JASMINE CAN TAKE.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.409
SHE NEEDS A BREAK, AND THE BABY
WILL NOT TAKE A BOTTLE FROM ME.

23:48.530 --> 23:50.555
- WELL, SOMETIMES
THEY DON'T WANT THE DAD.

23:50.670 --> 23:52.240
YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.978
- THE WHOLE THING IS NOT
WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.183
I MEAN, I KNOW JABBAR
WAS FIVE YEARS OLD

23:57.290 --> 23:58.598
WHEN I MET HIM,

23:58.710 --> 24:01.087
AND I CAN'T REALLY COMPARE
THE TWO SITUATIONS,

24:01.190 --> 24:02.293
BUT IT JUST FELT
A LOT EASIER.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.678
THERE WAS A, YOU KNOW,
AN INSTINCT CONNECTION WITH HIM

24:06.790 --> 24:09.167
THE MOMENT I SAW HIM,
AND...

24:09.270 --> 24:11.647
[sighs]

24:11.760 --> 24:13.614
- GIRLS ARE COMPLICATED.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.709
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

24:14.830 --> 24:17.207
I MEAN, BOYS ARE--
ARE SIMPLER.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.418
YOU GET HIM A HOTDOG--
THEY'RE COPASETIC.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.559
THEY'RE--THEY'RE GOOD TO GO,
AND, I MEAN...

24:25.670 --> 24:27.171
GIRLS ARE--YOU GOTTA WALK AROUND
ON EGGSHELLS WITH 'EM.

24:27.290 --> 24:30.737
I DON'T KNOW, ONE DAY
YOU'RE THE KING OF THE CASTLE--

24:30.840 --> 24:31.352
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.426
YOU'RE THEIR DADDY.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.802
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

24:34.920 --> 24:36.012
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.704
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE--
THEY HATE YOU.

24:39.820 --> 24:44.439
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS GONNA BE THIS HARD.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.370
- YEAH, IT'S DIFFICULT.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.959
- [sighs]

24:48.070 --> 24:49.617
- BUT THAT'S WHAT--

24:49.720 --> 24:51.301
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GOOD
AT THE END, YOU KNOW?

24:51.420 --> 24:55.413
I MEAN, IT CHANGES.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.760
I DON'T KNOW.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.100
- WHAT'S MOM THINK
OF THIS CAR?

24:59.220 --> 24:59.834
- OH, SHE LOVES IT.

24:59.940 --> 25:02.181
- DOES SHE?
- OOH...LOVES IT.

25:02.290 --> 25:04.326
- THERE. AND...OKAY.
[camera shutters clicking]

25:04.430 --> 25:06.842
- GOT IT?
- YEAH. REALLY GOOD.

25:06.950 --> 25:08.986
- YOU NEED TO TURN THAT DOWN.
- NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.182
- NO, IT HAS TO BE--
IT HAS TO BE A MORE PRECISE SHOT

25:10.300 --> 25:12.507
WITH THE CAMERA SO FAR AWAY.
- MAX, ENOUGH.

25:12.610 --> 25:15.295
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO HELP.
YOU AREN'T HELPING.

25:15.410 --> 25:16.297
[all talking at once]

25:16.410 --> 25:17.604
- SHE'S NOT GONNA BE TOO PALE

25:17.720 --> 25:18.573
WHEN IT HAPPENS.
- SHE LOOKS VERY PALE.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.022
- I AM A LITTLE PALE.

25:20.130 --> 25:20.505
- SO LET'S JUST DO
A COUPLE OF--

25:20.620 --> 25:22.372
[indistinct]

25:22.480 --> 25:23.230
- WE'LL JUST DO A COUPLE
TEST SHOTS, GUYS.

25:23.340 --> 25:26.059
- LINE UP YOUR NOSE
WITH YOUR BELLY BUTTON.

25:26.170 --> 25:28.206
- LET'S SEE YOUR POSTURE.
WARM AND HAPPY.

25:28.310 --> 25:28.890
- KEEP HER STRONG.
YOU KNOW?

25:29.010 --> 25:32.036
MATERNAL STILL.
- HEY, BABY!

25:32.150 --> 25:33.287
- OH, WAIT. NO, NO, NO.
- HEY, THERE SHE IS.

25:33.390 --> 25:37.451
WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE?
- OKAY, WE'RE WASTING TIME.

25:37.570 --> 25:38.878
- THAT'S TOO MATERNAL.
COME ON.

25:38.980 --> 25:40.709
- SHOULD I SIT? I'M SWEATING.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.846
EVERYONE JUST PIPE DOWN.
- SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S IN PAIN.

25:42.950 --> 25:43.985
- DEFINITELY DELETE
THE LAST ONE.

25:44.090 --> 25:45.569
- AUNT SARAH--
YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.250
- THIS IS--
WE'RE GONNA GET KILLED--

25:47.370 --> 25:48.359
- YOU'VE GOT A GOOD EYE.
- OKAY.

25:48.470 --> 25:49.368
- NO, YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS...

25:49.470 --> 25:53.122
[all talking at once]

25:53.240 --> 25:56.198
- DAMN IT.

25:56.310 --> 26:00.098
DAMN IT!

26:00.210 --> 26:01.654
[groans]

26:01.760 --> 26:03.625
- IT'S LAVENDER MINT.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.345
- OH, THANK YOU, MILLIE.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.552
[sighs]

26:06.660 --> 26:07.934
- I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TIME

26:08.040 --> 26:08.449
YOU'D WANT TO STOP
FOR THE NIGHT.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.144
NO--OH, GOD.

26:12.260 --> 26:15.115
NO, I'M KIND OF ON A ROLL HERE,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

26:15.220 --> 26:17.609
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S GETTING PRETTY LATE.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.325
- YEAH, I KNOW.

26:19.430 --> 26:22.058
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND GO UP TO BED WITHOUT ME,

26:22.160 --> 26:23.468
AND I'LL BE THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.719
- YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

26:25.820 --> 26:28.368
- NO, IT'S JUST
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.517
- YOU CAN'T KEEP AVOIDING THIS.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.611
- WELL, MILLIE,
I TELL YOU WHAT.

26:33.730 --> 26:35.482
NOW, IF I STOP NOW,
I'M GONNA HAVE PARTS

26:35.590 --> 26:36.864
ALL OVER THE PLACE,

26:36.970 --> 26:39.029
AND IT'S GONNA BE ONE HELL
OF A BIG MESS.

26:39.140 --> 26:43.383
- OKAY, FINE.
WE'LL TALK WHILE YOU WORK.

26:43.490 --> 26:45.731
- OKAY, CLUE ME IN HERE.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.762
EXACTLY WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE TALKING ABOUT?

26:47.880 --> 26:49.871
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE TALKING ABOUT.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.187
I TRIED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION
WITH YOU

26:52.300 --> 26:54.325
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY
OF SELLING THE HOUSE,

26:54.440 --> 26:55.361
AND YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM ME.

26:55.470 --> 26:59.600
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

26:59.720 --> 27:01.438
- WHY DON'T WE START
WITH YOUR FEELINGS?

27:01.550 --> 27:05.168
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU FEEL?
YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

27:05.270 --> 27:08.342
- [sighs]
I DON'T WANT TO SELL THE HOUSE.

27:08.450 --> 27:09.439
END OF DISCUSSION.

27:09.550 --> 27:12.314
SO WHY BOTHER
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION?

27:12.420 --> 27:16.868
- OKAY, YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT
TO SELL THE HOUSE,

27:16.980 --> 27:19.665
AND IN THE END, MAYBE I WON'T
WANT TO SELL THE HOUSE EITHER.

27:19.770 --> 27:22.421
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT!

27:22.530 --> 27:26.011
I DESERVE THAT MUCH.

27:32.370 --> 27:33.746
[door opens, shuts]

27:47.010 --> 27:48.659
- HEY.
SORRY, CAN I COME IN?

27:48.770 --> 27:49.794
- HEY, WE'RE CLOSED.
- I KNOW.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.357
I JUST THOUGHT THAT--
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:52.460 --> 27:54.075
- THE SHOOT WAS TERRIBLE,
AND, UM,

27:54.180 --> 27:55.761
I WAS VERY NERVOUS,
AND KRISTINA WAS NERVOUS,

27:55.880 --> 27:57.040
AND MAX WAS THE ONLY ONE

27:57.150 --> 27:57.878
WHO SEEMED TO KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOING,

27:57.980 --> 27:59.527
WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE NERVOUS.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.733
AND HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER
WANTED HER TO BE

28:01.850 --> 28:02.635
MATERNAL AND POWERFUL.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.502
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

28:04.610 --> 28:06.840
- WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T.

28:06.960 --> 28:07.813
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
EITHER, IT'S STUPID.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.993
- CAN YOU JUST TELL ME
IF I'M ANY GOOD?

28:12.100 --> 28:15.376
- [chuckles]
- PLEASE.

28:19.900 --> 28:22.619
- MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

28:22.730 --> 28:24.459
MM-HMM.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.976
MMM...

28:35.740 --> 28:37.116
THAT'S THE SHOT RIGHT THERE.

28:37.230 --> 28:40.779
I MEAN, THE OTHER ONES ARE...
DECENT.

28:40.890 --> 28:43.814
SOME OF 'EM ARE OKAY.
SOME ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.333
BUT THAT'S YOUR SHOT.
- OKAY.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.611
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

28:48.720 --> 28:49.573
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD HAVE DONE...

28:49.690 --> 28:52.409
DIFFERENT, BUT...

28:52.520 --> 28:56.581
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN STYLE.
[clears throat]

28:56.700 --> 28:59.908
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SHOT.

29:00.010 --> 29:03.116
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

29:03.220 --> 29:05.768
IT'S GOOD.

29:07.600 --> 29:08.703
- THANKS.

29:08.810 --> 29:11.017
- I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.463
HE TOLD ME WE HAD A NICE TALK
AND CALLED ME "BRO."

29:13.570 --> 29:16.915
AND NO, THE STICK HAS BEEN
ON THE DOOR FOR THREE HOURS.

29:17.030 --> 29:18.099
- AGAIN?
- THREE HOURS?

29:18.200 --> 29:20.304
- YES, THREE HOURS.
ALSO, HE TOOK MY SHEETS.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.128
- YOUR PERSONAL SHEETS?

29:22.240 --> 29:23.025
- WHICH ONES? NOT THE GRAY ONES?
- THE SHEETS YOU GOT ME. YES.

29:23.140 --> 29:24.584
- THE GRAY SHEETS?
- I SWEAR. YES.

29:24.690 --> 29:26.544
- OH, MY GOD. THAT'S NO JOKE.
- I KNOW.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.924
- THOSE WERE EXPENSIVE.
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.270
- I'M GONNA CALL HIM.
I KNOW YOU'RE EMBARRASSED.

29:31.390 --> 29:33.108
I'M LIKE A MOM,
BUT I'M GONNA CALL HIM

29:33.210 --> 29:35.098
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
HIS NUMBER, SO HA HA.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.733
- I'M JUST SAYING YOU CAN'T TALK
TO PEOPLE LIKE THIS.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.661
YOU HAVE TO GO AND CONFRONT
THEM.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.453
- WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT
GOING DOWN THERE--

29:41.570 --> 29:44.255
- LET'S GO DOWN THERE.
GOT THIS GUY ON OUR SIDE.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.566
- WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK TO HIM.
WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK TO HIM.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.056
- WHAT, LIKE SCARE HIM?
- NO. NO.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.013
WE'RE GONNA BE NICE.
- YEAH, NICE.

29:48.130 --> 29:49.631
- WE'RE GONNA REASON
WITH THE GUY.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.081
- LET'S GO GET HIM. COME ON.
- COOL?

29:52.790 --> 29:53.814
- WHAT THE HELL?

29:53.930 --> 29:55.545
- OH, MY GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:55.650 --> 29:57.197
- THERE'S A ROOMMATE ISSUE
THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED,

29:57.310 --> 29:58.891
AND IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU--
I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.059
I APOLOGIZE.
- NO, NO, NO, NOT WITH THIS.

30:01.170 --> 30:02.797
I'M SO SORRY, I CAN'T--
- SORRY.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.208
- DUDE, WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

30:04.310 --> 30:05.038
- "DUDE" IS NOT HIS NAME.
IT'S DREW.

30:05.140 --> 30:06.619
NOT "DUDE," NOT "BRO."
DREW.

30:06.730 --> 30:07.549
SAY IT. LET'S PRACTICE.
DREW.

30:07.660 --> 30:08.627
- DREW.
- SAY IT!

30:08.730 --> 30:10.527
- DREW.
- THAT SOUNDED GOOD.

30:10.630 --> 30:12.109
- DUDE, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE--

30:12.220 --> 30:13.801
- NO, NO, NO,
DUDE'S NOT MY NAME EITHER.

30:13.910 --> 30:16.253
SERGEANT YORK IS FINE.
- HE'S IN THE ARMY.

30:16.360 --> 30:17.566
- AND IF DREW HAS A PROBLEM WITH
YOU, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME.

30:17.670 --> 30:20.730
YOU GOT IT?
- GOT IT.

30:20.850 --> 30:22.181
- GREAT.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.813
- YOU KNOW,
QUIT LOCKING ME OUT.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.808
AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT
THE LINE.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.603
KEEP YOUR STUFF
ON THAT SIDE.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.335
- OH, I HAVE SOMETHING.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.123
UM, THE SHEETS THING,
IT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN

30:31.240 --> 30:32.684
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
NOT A BIG DEAL,

30:32.790 --> 30:34.371
BUT ACTUALLY, EVEN IF
YOU DRY CLEAN IT, THE SMELL IS--

30:34.480 --> 30:36.061
- YES, AND THE SHEETS--
DON'T TOUCH HIS SHEETS.

30:36.170 --> 30:38.172
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING OF HIS
WITHOUT ASKING

30:38.280 --> 30:39.554
FROM NOW ON, OKAY?
- OKAY.

30:39.660 --> 30:41.890
- GREAT.

30:42.010 --> 30:43.932
- SEE YA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:44.040 --> 30:47.146
- UM...GOOD TALK, BRO.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.662
- OKAY, THE RUNTS ARE ASLEEP,
VICTOR'S HOMEWORK IS DONE,

30:49.770 --> 30:53.228
SO LET'S TALK.
- OKAY.

30:53.330 --> 30:54.319
I THINK YOU NAILED IT
WHEN YOU SAID

30:54.430 --> 30:56.318
IT'S NOT GONNA FIX ITSELF
OVERNIGHT.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.748
- GOOD, SO WE AGREE.

30:57.850 --> 30:59.010
- IT'S NOT GONNA FIX ITSELF

30:59.130 --> 31:00.119
IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS
EITHER.

31:00.230 --> 31:02.676
- YEAH.
- SO THE LONGER HE STAYS THERE,

31:02.790 --> 31:03.779
THE HARDER IT IS FOR HIM
TO START OVER.

31:03.890 --> 31:05.755
AND I THINK WE JUST NEED
TO DO IT.

31:05.860 --> 31:06.610
WE NEED TO RIP OFF
THE BAND-AID.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.679
- YOU'RE--

31:10.790 --> 31:12.678
YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM BACK?
- YEAH.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.621
- NOW?
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING?

31:15.730 --> 31:17.903
- WE'VE BEEN TRYING.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.478
I TUTORED HIM EVERY DAY
THIS WHOLE SUMMER

31:20.600 --> 31:21.214
WHILE YOU WERE AT WORK.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.595
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

31:23.700 --> 31:24.564
- IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

31:24.670 --> 31:25.807
IT MEANS THAT I KNOW
WHERE HE'S AT ON THIS.

31:25.910 --> 31:27.559
I KNOW WHAT I'M SEEING.
- SO DO I.

31:27.670 --> 31:29.297
- NOT THE WAY THAT I DO.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.220
- DON'T PULL RANK WITH ME.
- I'M NOT PULLING--

31:31.330 --> 31:33.264
- I NEVER DID THAT WITH YOU
WHEN YOU WERE WORKING.

31:33.370 --> 31:35.429
IT'S NOT FAIR.
- I'M SURE YOU SAW PLENTY

31:35.540 --> 31:37.508
THAT I DIDN'T SEE
WHILE I WAS WORKING.

31:37.610 --> 31:39.817
AND YOU MADE DECISIONS
WITHOUT EVEN CONSULTING ME.

31:39.930 --> 31:43.058
- YEAH, PB &J OR TUNA FISH?
BALLET OR KARATE?

31:43.170 --> 31:44.137
NOTHING LIKE THIS.

31:44.240 --> 31:44.968
NOTHING LIKE THIS
EVER CAME UP.

31:45.070 --> 31:45.991
- WELL, THIS HAS COME UP NOW,

31:46.110 --> 31:48.556
AND I THINK WE NEED
TO HOLD HIM BACK.

31:48.660 --> 31:49.968
AND I DISAGREE.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.140
I SEE A KID WHO'S TRYING,
WHO'S MAKING HUGE STRIDES.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.696
IF WE PULL HIM BACK NOW,
HIS--

31:55.810 --> 31:58.529
I MEAN, IT WILL JUST ABSOLUTELY
SHRED HIS SELF-CONFIDENCE.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.188
- NO, WHAT'S GONNA SHRED
HIS SELF-CONFIDENCE

32:01.290 --> 32:04.157
IS KEEPING HIM IN A CLASS
WHERE HE CAN'T KEEP UP.

32:04.260 --> 32:06.364
THERE ARE STUDIES ON THIS.

32:06.470 --> 32:07.676
ED WAS TELLING ME
THAT HE READ A STUDY ABOUT--

32:07.780 --> 32:10.294
- ED? WHO THE HELL IS ED?

32:10.410 --> 32:14.881
- ED IS A PARENT FROM
THE SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.513
- ED BROOKS?
- YEAH.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.826
- YOU TALKED TO ED BROOKS
ABOUT THIS?

32:17.930 --> 32:20.342
FANTASTIC. WELL,
WE MIGHT AS WELL GO

32:20.450 --> 32:22.486
AND JUST TALK TO VICTOR NOW
AND TELL HIM,

32:22.590 --> 32:23.818
BECAUSE THE WHOLE SCHOOL'S
GONNA KNOW ABOUT THIS

32:23.940 --> 32:24.895
IN THE MORNING.

32:25.010 --> 32:25.897
- HE'S NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE.

32:26.010 --> 32:26.931
- OH, ED WON'T, NO.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.359
BUT HIS WIFE PROBABLY WILL.

32:28.460 --> 32:30.860
SHE HAPPENS TO BE THE BIGGEST
BLABBERMOUTH ON THE PTA.

32:30.980 --> 32:33.448
- LISTEN, RELAX, SHE'S NOT EVEN
AROUND THE SCHOOL ANYMORE.

32:33.570 --> 32:35.845
ED HARDLY SEES HER.
SHE'S NOT GONNA--

32:35.950 --> 32:38.089
- WHAT ELSE ARE YOU AND ED
TALKING ABOUT?

32:38.190 --> 32:39.805
- HE JUST CAUGHT ME
IN A BAD MOMENT.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.842
I WAS UPSET, AND SO I KIND OF--
- YEAH.

32:41.960 --> 32:42.779
- ANYWAY, LET'S STAY
ON TOPIC HERE.

32:42.890 --> 32:45.950
- YEAH, LET'S STAY ON TOPIC.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.267
WHAT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT BREAKFAST THIS MORNING?

32:48.380 --> 32:49.642
- WHAT ABOUT THIS MORNING
AT BREAKFAST?

32:49.760 --> 32:53.582
- YOU LAYING INTO OUR SON
ABOUT THE STUPID BOOK, JULIA.

32:53.690 --> 32:56.341
YOU NEEDLE HIM LIKE THAT,
HE'S GONNA KNOW THAT

32:56.450 --> 32:57.621
SOMETHING IS UP.

32:57.730 --> 33:00.722
- SOMETHING IS UP.

33:00.840 --> 33:06.380
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.047
- ARE YOU ENDING
THIS CONVERSATION

33:08.150 --> 33:09.663
THAT WE'VE WAITED ALL DAY
TO HAVE?

33:09.780 --> 33:11.224
- WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY?

33:11.330 --> 33:14.458
- TH ERE--
[sighs]

33:14.570 --> 33:17.266
WE NEED TO SET UP
A MEETING WITH HIS TEACHER,

33:17.370 --> 33:19.122
AND WITH THE PRINCIPAL,
AND WE NEED TO DISCUSS

33:19.230 --> 33:20.879
GETTING HIM BACK
INTO FOURTH GRADE

33:20.990 --> 33:22.742
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

33:22.860 --> 33:23.713
THAT'S WHAT THERE IS
TO DISCUSS.

33:23.820 --> 33:25.822
- NO.

33:25.930 --> 33:29.798
NO.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.061
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

33:32.180 --> 33:35.104
WE MADE A PLAN
WITH HIS TEACHER

33:35.220 --> 33:36.596
THAT WE WERE GONNA
FIND HIM TUTORING,

33:36.700 --> 33:39.009
WE WERE GONNA TAKE A MONTH,
AND THEN WE WOULD REEVALUATE.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.974
AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

33:41.080 --> 33:45.801
YOU DON'T LIKE IT...
TALK TO ED.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.536
I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

34:02.590 --> 34:04.512
- GOOD MORNING.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.417
- GOOD MORNING.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.626
- WOW. I MEAN, THAT IS
ONE AWESOME CAMPAIGN

34:09.730 --> 34:10.697
PHOTO RIGHT THERE.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.937
- YES.
- RIGHT?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.551
- YOUR SISTER REALLY
CAME THROUGH.

34:13.670 --> 34:14.807
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

34:14.910 --> 34:16.252
I THINK SHE DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.804
- IT'S STRONG, IT'S--

34:17.910 --> 34:20.561
- THAT IS--THAT IS PROFESSIONAL
QUALITY RIGHT THERE.

34:20.670 --> 34:22.114
- MM-HMM.

34:22.230 --> 34:23.948
- SHE'S GONNA EXPECT
TO GET PAID NEXT TIME.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.948
MORE THAN 50 BUCKS.

34:26.060 --> 34:27.334
- YOU MADE THE DEAL.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.089
- PRETTY SLICK DEAL I MADE...
- YEAH, IT'S GOOD.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.883
- SHE DESERVES EVERY PENNY.

34:30.990 --> 34:33.823
I JUST--
IT'S SO WEIRD, ISN'T IT?

34:33.930 --> 34:36.546
- WHAT?
- THE PICTURE.

34:36.660 --> 34:38.969
I MEAN, JUST TO LOOK AT IT,
IT'S LIKE I'M...

34:39.070 --> 34:40.890
NOT USED TO SEEING MYSELF
WITH HAIR.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.346
- RIGHT.
- YOU KNOW?

34:45.460 --> 34:47.974
I CATCH MYSELF, YOU KNOW...

34:48.080 --> 34:49.832
WALKING PAST A MIRROR
OR SOMETHING,

34:49.940 --> 34:54.013
AND I STILL HALF-EXPECT ME
TO BE BALD, YOU KNOW?

34:54.120 --> 34:55.985
I THINK,
"THERE GOES BALD KRISTINA."

34:56.090 --> 34:58.706
CANCER KRISTINA.
- UH-HUH.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.084
- I FEEL LIKE I KICKED CANCER
IN ITS TEETH.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.918
I FEEL LIKE KIND OF
A BADASS, YOU KNOW?

35:03.030 --> 35:04.054
- YOU DID KICK CANCER
IN ITS TEETH.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.125
YOU ARE A BADASS.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.824
- WE'RE LUCKY.
- WE ARE.

35:08.930 --> 35:11.239
- WE'RE VERY LUCKY.
- MM-HMM.

35:11.350 --> 35:14.899
- I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
LATELY I'VE JUST HAD THIS

35:15.000 --> 35:16.695
"I DEFEATED CANCER"
ATTITUDE.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.529
I CAN DO ANYTHING
AND CONQUER THE WORLD...

35:18.630 --> 35:21.315
- YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
- AND I FEEL LIKE--

35:21.420 --> 35:23.240
I FEEL LIKE
I GOT AHEAD OF MYSELF

35:23.360 --> 35:25.214
WITH THIS CAMPAIGN,
YOU KNOW?

35:25.330 --> 35:27.469
- UH-HUH.
- I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO...

35:27.570 --> 35:29.151
JUST TO PULL BACK A LITTLE,

35:29.260 --> 35:31.296
MAYBE TALK TO HEATHER ABOUT,
YOU KNOW,

35:31.400 --> 35:34.267
NOT SPENDING AS MUCH JUST
UNTIL I CAN MAKE SOME MONEY.

35:34.370 --> 35:36.292
FUNDRAISING AND...
JUST TO SEE WHERE WE STAND.

35:36.410 --> 35:38.719
- KRISTINA, YOU KNOW,
AFTER GIVING THAT LITTLE SPEECH,

35:38.820 --> 35:40.617
I DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE
BUT TO REACH IN MY WALLET

35:40.720 --> 35:42.688
AND HAND OVER MY CREDIT CARD.
- OKAY, WELL, THAT WAS

35:42.790 --> 35:45.099
NOT MY INTENTION.
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET SYMPATHY.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.485
I'M--I'M JUST--
- I KNOW.

35:47.590 --> 35:49.797
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE MIXED
FEELINGS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.174
- I KNOW THAT YOU DO.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.101
SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?
- WELL, IT LEAVES ME

35:54.220 --> 35:55.903
WITH NO CHOICE.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.661
TAKE IT.
JUST TAKE IT.

35:59.770 --> 36:00.634
- I CAN'T.
- TAKE IT.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.150
- CAN'T DO IT.
- JUST TAKE IT.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.182
TAKE THE OTHER ONE.
- OH, GOD!

36:04.300 --> 36:06.325
- TAKE IT. JUST...
- IT'S BETTER THAN SEX.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.533
- TAKE THE WHOLE THING.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.643
- THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING
IN ME.

36:13.750 --> 36:15.547
- I LOVE YOU.

36:15.650 --> 36:17.231
- I LOVE YOU.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.683
- NO MORE GREEN JUICE.
- I CAN GET RED JUICE.

36:19.790 --> 36:20.233
- HEY.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.558
[groans]

36:29.560 --> 36:31.482
YOU REMEMBER WHEN ADAM
AND CROSBY

36:31.600 --> 36:33.181
HUNG THE WELCOME HOME SIGN
FROM THE TREE THERE

36:33.290 --> 36:36.259
WHEN WE BROUGHT JULIA HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL?

36:39.050 --> 36:43.293
AND SARAH...

36:43.400 --> 36:46.198
SHE HAD HER FIRST PLAY
IN THE BARN.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.677
[chuckles]

36:48.790 --> 36:52.135
REMEMBER CROSBY'S
PUNK ROCK BAND?

36:52.240 --> 36:54.344
WERE THEY BAD OR WHAT?

36:54.450 --> 36:56.918
I MEAN, PRACTICING
ALL NIGHT LONG, HUH?

37:04.670 --> 37:06.809
SARAH, WHEN SHE WAS
A LITTLE GIRL,

37:06.910 --> 37:11.210
SHE RAN AWAY FROM HOME,
SHE HIDES IN THE GUEST HOUSE...

37:11.330 --> 37:14.367
TELLS US SHE NEVER WANTS
TO SEE US AGAIN.

37:14.470 --> 37:17.189
- ZEEK...
- AND JULIA, I MEAN...

37:17.300 --> 37:19.575
WASN'T IT YESTERDAY
SHE STOOD THERE

37:19.680 --> 37:22.399
AND TOLD US
SHE GOT INTO STANFORD?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.406
AND CROSBY
GOT MARRIED DOWN THERE

37:25.510 --> 37:28.229
WHERE I STRUNG UP ALL THOSE
FOURTH OF JULY LIGHTS.

37:28.340 --> 37:32.686
I MEAN, HOW MANY MILLIONS
OF YEARS AGO WAS THAT?

37:38.910 --> 37:42.949
EVERYTHING I WANT
IS RIGHT HERE, MILLIE.

37:43.050 --> 37:45.109
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS...

37:45.220 --> 37:48.018
THIS IS MY THIRD ACT
WITH YOU.

37:54.230 --> 37:57.165
- I WANT MORE.

37:57.270 --> 38:02.822
I WANT US TO DO
WONDERFUL THINGS TOGETHER.

38:02.930 --> 38:05.376
LIKE I CAN PICTURE US

38:05.490 --> 38:07.139
BRAGGING ABOUT
OUR GRANDCHILDREN

38:07.250 --> 38:11.380
AS WE'RE BOATING
DOWN THE SEINE.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.902
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, I--

38:14.010 --> 38:17.138
I'VE BEEN PAINTING THIS YARD
FOR 20 YEARS NOW.

38:17.260 --> 38:19.637
KINDA LIKE TO PAINT
SOMETHING ELSE.

38:19.740 --> 38:22.561
THINK HOW MANY THINGS
WE COULD DO.

38:22.670 --> 38:24.945
HOW MANY THINGS
WE COULD AFFORD TO DO

38:25.060 --> 38:28.917
IF WE SOLD THE HOUSE.

38:29.030 --> 38:31.544
ALL THE PLACES WE COULD SEE.

38:31.650 --> 38:32.309
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE SEEN OTHER PLACES

38:32.410 --> 38:35.857
I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR 'EM.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.441
- WELL, I HAVEN'T.

38:41.560 --> 38:45.109
I WAS SO YOUNG
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

38:45.210 --> 38:47.075
I WAS PRACTICALLY
A BABY MYSELF

38:47.180 --> 38:49.102
WHEN ADAM WAS BORN.

38:51.290 --> 38:55.010
I'M NOT COMPLAINING.
YOU KNOW THAT.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.669
IT'S BEEN A GOOD LIFE.
IT'S BEEN A BEAUTIFUL LIFE.

38:58.780 --> 39:01.499
I'VE LOVED EVERY MINUTE
OF IT.

39:05.370 --> 39:07.406
BUT I'M READY
FOR THE NEXT STEP.

39:17.250 --> 39:20.834
- HEY. HEY.
I NEED THE ROOM, BRO.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.111
- YOU GOT IT, DREW.

39:24.220 --> 39:26.427

39:34.710 --> 39:37.918

39:38.030 --> 39:39.850

39:41.370 --> 39:43.167

- OH, YEAH.

39:43.270 --> 39:46.068
MY MOM PACKED THAT FOR ME.

39:46.170 --> 39:47.922
- NO, I LOVE SCRABBLE.
- YEAH?

39:48.040 --> 39:49.860

40:48.270 --> 40:52.092
DRIFTED?
"AND THEY REMINDED ME

40:54.380 --> 40:55.961
