Are you at least
gonna call the cops
this time?

00:56.599 --> 00:57.634
Oh. Then they might stop.

00:59.185 --> 01:03.269
Just when they're beginning
to capture my eyes.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.600
Come on, Dad.
Let Rodrigo do this.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.603
You know, if you wanted,
you could put
an end to all this.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.905
Of course.
There are other ways
to save the company.

to China because I'm
craving egg foo yung.

You know,
ljust got off the phone
with some investors.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.161
Yes, and they want
a controlling interest?

We get to stay here
with the people

01:27.838 --> 01:29.749

loyal to this company.

01:51.737 --> 01:52.772
Dad?

02:02.707 --> 02:05.039
I need you to
drive me to a doctor.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.420
This would totally suck.

02:17.555 --> 02:22.299
Patient's visited
China a lot recently.
What about the JBE virus?

02:22.393 --> 02:23.883
Why don't you check
his vaccination record

before you make
another stupid...

02:26.856 --> 02:29.893

What? He apologized.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.610
What? Because he
said he apologized?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.074
He's saying he's
sorry that someone,
namely you,

03:19.158 --> 03:20.864
overreacted,
namely by punching him.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.157
He grabbed my behind.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.111
The word is it was
a celebratory slap
after you completed

03:25.206 --> 03:27.367
your first ever
AVM embolization.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.162
He grabbed it,
he apologized
for grabbing it,

03:30.252 --> 03:32.834
and now he's taking classes
because he grabbed it.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.745
The classes make
him sympathetic.

03:34.882 --> 03:38.921
Which, in turn, makes his
unrepentant attacker evil.

03:39.178 --> 03:42.887

makes you so fired.

I'll take that action, too,
but you're already

The fact that you see
that as inherently bad

07:22.276 --> 07:24.562

he'll throw another clot.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.635
Exactly.
It's a conclusive test.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.682
There's no actual risk.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.312
As long as you're
both paying attention

12:09.813 --> 12:12.020
and are both good
enough to work here.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.145
I hear one of you
thinks I'm a real bastard.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.397
I guess that would be me.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.991
Your boss uses blackmail
and you question
my professional ethics?

12:25.996 --> 12:29.454
Will you be instituting
worker safety regulations
in your new factories?

12:29.541 --> 12:30.621
Oh, absolutely.

12:30.709 --> 12:31.949
What aboutjuice boxes
in the break room

12:32.044 --> 12:33.409

you'll be hiring?

12:33.503 --> 12:36.210
Charges of child exploitation
against American companies

12:36.340 --> 12:38.046
have been blown
way out of proportion.

12:38.175 --> 12:43.010
My 10-year-old cousin
lives near Cebu City,
works at an American factory.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.669
I am so sorry.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.380
It's the best thing
for him.

12:47.517 --> 12:50.259
It sucks,
but the Filipino factories
suck worse.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.265
And the schools would
suck if they existed.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.854
So this is
the family's best hope.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.609
Itching. Interesting.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.865
Not interesting.
Already went away.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.704
Doubly interesting.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.374

explain the arrival
and the departure.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.709
That's real mature, House.
What do you mean?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.792
It's outlandishly childish.
I custom built this puppy.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.592
It's got 106 LED's,

13:24.805 --> 13:26.545

light to your eye

13:28.600 --> 13:29.589

are stimulating

13:31.103 --> 13:32.843

13:33.105 --> 13:35.892

(LAUGHS) Oh, cool.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.738
You think I'm not...

13:49.579 --> 13:51.615
You think I'm not gonna
go to Foreman with this?

13:51.707 --> 13:54.198
You will and
IWIdenyit

13:54.292 --> 13:56.157
He'll believe you,
but then these two

13:56.253 --> 13:59.620
believe that
the policy of protecting
American jobs starts at home,

13:59.715 --> 14:01.956
so they'll never
testify against me.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.671
And you won't be
able to prove anything.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.467
Now, ifl punched him
in the face, that
he could prove.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.431
JESSICA:
I remember you
saying something

14:11.518 --> 14:13.930
about how loyalty to
real estate was stupid.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.849
This is about reclaiming
(LOUDLY) stolen property.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.271
Loyalty to real estate
is stupid because
loyalty is stupid.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.647
First patriotism,
now loyalty.

14:23.739 --> 14:24.945
You hate ice cream, too?

14:25.407 --> 14:26.567
French vanilla, yeah.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.696
To willfully
identify yourself
with something else

14:29.786 --> 14:31.492
is a perversion
of self-expression.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.786
JESSICA: I had a thought.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.955
Other than the fact
that loyalty is the basis

14:35.042 --> 14:36.873
of all meaningful
relationships.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.997
The daughter said
that her mother died
of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

was misdiagnosed?

14:44.593 --> 14:47.335
Dutch chocolate's not bad.
Gotta give them that.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.262
Her lymphoma
could have been caused
by a virus, HTLV-1,

14:50.348 --> 14:53.761
which our patient
contracted through
having sex with his wife.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.810
In other words,
loyalty gave him cancer.

need an explanation.

15:13.497 --> 15:14.577
What took you so long?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.246
We already lost
one of them.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.789
You need help
with the lacerations?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.083
No. I think
I've got palliative.

take preventative?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.499
Prevent what?
He got in a fight.

15:23.799 --> 15:27.166
Which he started,
which means he's both
irascible and stupid.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.591
I told the drunk,
racist frat guy

15:28.678 --> 15:31.090
the proper term is
"conjoined twin",
not "Siamese".

15:31.973 --> 15:34.589
Well, I can't comment
on the drunk or the frat,

15:34.684 --> 15:36.766
but Chang and Eng
were both, in fact,

15:36.853 --> 15:40.186
born in Siam and they were,
in fact, twins.

If your name was Richard,
it'd be okay for me

some of the tripe

15:45.362 --> 15:46.818

You decided to
move your company
right after your wife died.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.120

your emotions factored in.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.663

that I wouldn't get fired

18:09.381 --> 18:11.337

disciplinary hearing.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.753
Ever since then,
he's been acting like

18:13.843 --> 18:16.004
he's actually
trying to get me fired.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.928
That's because
he is actually trying
to get you fired.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.755
Does he hate me?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.681
Not sure that's
relevant to the equation.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.805
So it's really over $100?

18:24.980 --> 18:27.642
Not sure
the amount is relevant.
He's fighting for his honor.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.275
He'll ruin my career.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.439
Not sure that's...

18:30.610 --> 18:34.194
What if I bet him
$200 I will get fired?

18:34.322 --> 18:37.860
He sees competing bets
with the same person
as a disgrace to the game.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.192
He'll be even more
motivated to beat you.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.530
If you were me,
what would you do?

18:47.377 --> 18:50.585
You have to give him
something he values
more than honor.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.172
And you should
update your resume.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.805

troponins were equivocal.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.886

one third of its value

aren't a violation
of your parole?

19:26.708 --> 19:30.075
It's not insider trading.
Just betting on
myself to solve the case.

I pay you back.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.458
No.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.966
No, you don't say "no",
you make a counteroffer.

I'm not loaning
my boss money.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.923

I'll make a counter.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.136
$20,000?

19:46.478 --> 19:49.060
I'll buy options
instead of shares.
More risk, but more upside.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.603
But that's as low
as I'm gonna go.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.193

19:54.319 --> 19:55.525
Really? No backsies.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.775

your clinic hours.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.317

20:00.658 --> 20:02.694
I've seen how you
disrespect those patients.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.027
So you want
twice as many of them
to be disrespected?

20:05.121 --> 20:08.955
Spend more hours with them,
you'll treat
them more humanely.

20:10.835 --> 20:14.248

a land war in Russia
will be a good idea.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.587

Here's what I'm thinking.
You went to a parole hearing

20:20.970 --> 20:23.131
where one of your old
patients was denied.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.713
Hence the attire,
hence the tardiness,

20:25.809 --> 20:28.095
and most important,
hence the anger.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.389
You think you can
restore the cosmic balance

20:30.480 --> 20:32.311
by doing
extra good here.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.180
More annoyingly
by having me do it.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.404
And deal.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.973

Well, then you'll be

This case boils down to,
"He said, she said."

22:08.244 --> 22:09.700
"and I am taking

he'd been drinking

22:22.425 --> 22:26.293
Andrews was taking
sexual harassment classes,
not AA.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.964
That means
he didn't get in trouble
for drinking.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.307
Which means that
Foreman signed off on it,

22:33.436 --> 22:36.428

We had a patient who was
going to die without

23:16.020 --> 23:19.353
Andrews was
the only neurologist
I could reach.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.731
He told me he had
a few glasses of wine and
that he shouldn't do it,

23:22.819 --> 23:25.310
but he also said
that you were good,

23:25.697 --> 23:28.780
and you were ready to
do one as long as
you were supervised.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.402
So we agreed that
he would come in,

23:30.493 --> 23:32.029
but wouldn't
touch the patient.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.413

23:35.957 --> 23:38.494
when I tell them
the whole story
at my hearing.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.497
I already did.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.329
I had a closed
session hearing
last week.

23:45.550 --> 23:48.132
The board decided to
dock me two weeks' pay.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.007
Oh.

23:54.559 --> 23:58.472
You've been working
for House for two weeks,
it's already too long.

24:03.985 --> 24:07.352
No sign of any
electrical abnormalities
in the right atrium.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.103
I'm so dead.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.689
I think House set me up.

24:12.827 --> 24:16.695
Have you sent the committee
a character reference for me?

24:16.998 --> 24:18.283
Ithoughtyou
don't like favors.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.080
I don't like gifts.
It wouldn't be a gift,

24:20.168 --> 24:21.829
it'd just be you
telling the truth.

24:22.712 --> 24:23.792
I hardly know you.

24:24.756 --> 24:26.041
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

24:26.674 --> 24:29.791
02 sat is 89.
Did we perforate?
Is he tamponading?

24:29.886 --> 24:32.298
Heart rate's only 90
and neck veins are flat.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.174
Then why isn't
he saturating?

24:41.147 --> 24:42.307
HOUSE:
Seems healthy to me.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.854
Let's release him.

24:45.401 --> 24:49.895
My option to sell
Barton Foods at $34
is about to expire

24:49.989 --> 24:51.570
'cause I thought the patient
would be better by now.

24:51.741 --> 24:55.325
Instead,
I am going to lose $20,000.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.526
Twenty?

24:56.621 --> 24:59.328
Your five plus
the five I stole
from Wilson

24:59.415 --> 25:01.326
plus the 10 I got
on margin.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.408
You're gonna have to talk
to my bankruptcy attorney.

25:04.253 --> 25:08.542
Unless... There is
a way that you can get
your money back.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.498
Give me the full $200,000.

25:10.593 --> 25:11.753
(SCOFFS)

25:12.178 --> 25:16.763
And extrapolating.
Tomorrow, you'll owe just
shy of a million dollars.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.431
It's your own fault.
You forced me
to go with the options.

25:19.519 --> 25:23.103
Your damn anger issues
are screwing with
my finances.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.354
Regular stock this time,
nice and safe.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.560
I'm not angry.

25:26.651 --> 25:28.016
I don't know if you're
trying to make me angry,
but...

25:28.111 --> 25:30.727
You refuse to bet
on yourself. That
means low self-esteem.

25:30.947 --> 25:34.030
So if I give you $200,000,
I'll feel smart and pretty?

25:34.117 --> 25:35.732
Low self-esteem
can be brought on

25:35.827 --> 25:37.943
by exposure to
one's relatives.

25:38.287 --> 25:42.200
Nice clothes and anger,
classic symptoms of
a family gathering.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.411
You were late
the other day

25:44.544 --> 25:45.875
'cause you were
having breakfast

25:45.962 --> 25:48.294
with Grammy Adams
or Cousin Itt.

25:48.423 --> 25:50.880
She was nagging you
about finding a husband.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.548
All right.
This is getting annoying.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.546
I'll just tell you
what I was...
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

25:55.930 --> 25:58.216
No spoilers.
They ruin everything.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.969
Pulmonology was that way.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.138
Our patient's lung problem
is not a lung problem.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.304
It's a brain problem.
We're consulting
with neurology.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.018
CHI: That's my old boss.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.142
You don't actually think
this is neurological.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.271
I don't know what it is.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.445
But maybe
I should just accept
the patient's death

26:14.532 --> 26:17.194
if getting help would
lead to awkwardness.

26:19.829 --> 26:24.619
Dr. Andrews, my associates,
Doctors Adams and Park.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.539
Ah.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.541
Nice to meet you,
Dr. Adams.

26:33.301 --> 26:34.711
Hello, Dr. Park.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.597
You two know each other?

26:39.724 --> 26:41.510
It's a small world.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.675
Dr. Park,
maybe you'd like to update
our esteemed colleague

26:44.771 --> 26:46.932
on the condition
of our patient?

26:50.735 --> 26:55.069
Micropsia,
bleeding, tachycardia
and difficulty breathing.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.319
Cute butt, huh?

27:01.037 --> 27:02.117
Can we go now?

27:02.205 --> 27:05.288
What, you really
want to turn your
back on this guy?

27:05.416 --> 27:06.792
Sorry. Carry on.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.829
Uh...

27:08.920 --> 27:12.287
Well, it sounds like
there could be
spinal cord involvement.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.669
Have you considered
normal pressure
hydrocephalus?

27:18.054 --> 27:21.217
Okay. Normal pressure
hydrocephalus going once.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.013
Normal pressure
hydrocephalus going twice...

27:23.100 --> 27:24.806
It's not his spinal cord,

27:24.894 --> 27:27.556
it's the wiring between
his heart and his brain.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.512
Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

27:29.816 --> 27:33.229
We do a tilt table test,
see how his
heart rate responds.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.601
That'll confirm.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.978
Well, if he has
normal pressure
hydrocephalus,

27:37.073 --> 27:38.859
a tilt table test
could put him in a coma.

27:38.950 --> 27:41.066
Then it's a good thing
he has ADS.

27:43.204 --> 27:45.069
You really believe
in this diagnosis?

27:45.164 --> 27:46.665
Because if this is
just a pissing contest,

27:46.749 --> 27:48.580
you're at a severe
anatomical disadvantage.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.909
It's autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

27:51.045 --> 27:54.037
No, it's normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.122
Do a spinal fluid test
to confirm.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.838
We're doing
the tilt table.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.135
That makes sense.

28:01.222 --> 28:03.178
You'd rather
have House fire you
than Foreman.

28:03.266 --> 28:06.133
This bet's gotta be
a test, see if I can
handle working with him.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.435
I need to prove
I have the confidence
to disobey him.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.890
Do you have any
medical justification
for your diagnosis?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.642
The symptoms fit
and Andrews is a hack.

28:17.488 --> 28:18.728
Do you think I'm right?

28:24.662 --> 28:26.448
Let's go.
No.

28:26.956 --> 28:28.366
You need to go
prepare for your hearing.

28:36.257 --> 28:38.168
Fifteen more minutes,
Mr. Barton.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.668
A skin resurfacing
laser is missing.

28:42.638 --> 28:43.969
And why are you
asking me about it?

28:44.056 --> 28:45.307
Because you work for House.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.136
What would House want
with a skin resurfacing laser?

28:48.227 --> 28:50.263
I have no idea.
Have you seen it?

28:50.646 --> 28:51.977
THAD: My feet feel hot.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.608
That's completely normal.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.650
No. But House has
been talking about how

28:57.778 --> 28:59.814
badly he wants to
remove those prison tats.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.818
It's a very expensive machine
and I'd like it back.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.820
Please tell me
if you hear anything.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.778
How expensive?

29:09.040 --> 29:10.155
$200,000.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.703
He took it.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.417
I have no idea.

29:15.504 --> 29:16.914
Park's hearing's
about to start.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.665
You're covering for him.
I did the same thing
many times.

29:20.885 --> 29:21.965
My advice to you,

29:22.053 --> 29:24.635
figure out what line
you aren't willing
to cross for him.

29:24.722 --> 29:27.054
Because, eventually,
he'll ask you to cross it.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.310
How are your feet?

29:38.486 --> 29:39.692
Mr. Barton?

29:43.282 --> 29:45.193
Can you hear me, Mr. Barton?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.323
Oh, no.

29:54.210 --> 29:56.292
FOREMAN: We have convened
the Disciplinary Committee

29:56.379 --> 29:57.664
to decide
the appropriate action

29:57.755 --> 29:59.586
that should be taken
against Dr. Chi Park

29:59.674 --> 30:03.383
as a result of her actions
on October 7th of this year.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.460
Dr. Park, do you have
an opening statement?

30:05.554 --> 30:07.886
Dr. Foreman,
members of the committee,

30:07.974 --> 30:12.217
thank you for giving me
this opportunity to speak
to you today. I...

30:13.270 --> 30:16.103
Good news. You can
cancel the hearing, because
I'm firing her myself.

30:16.232 --> 30:17.221
She's not yours to fire...

30:17.400 --> 30:19.311
Then you guys
better fire her
for insubordination.

30:19.402 --> 30:21.438
She went rogue
and my patient
is now in a coma.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.559
I'm the one
who did the test...

30:22.655 --> 30:23.770
No. It was my idea.

30:23.864 --> 30:24.899
Seriously, House?

30:24.991 --> 30:26.947
At least I'm smart enough
to know what I don't know.

30:27.076 --> 30:29.488
She went out of
her way to defy me,
she needs...

30:29.578 --> 30:31.785
Damn it, she...
Just fire her!

30:31.914 --> 30:33.415
FOREMAN: My apologies.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.741
My apologies, Dr. Park.

30:37.128 --> 30:39.460
Dr. House's comments
will, of course,

30:39.547 --> 30:41.253
have no bearing
on this hearing.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.165
Please continue.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.753
l, uh...

30:49.598 --> 30:51.429
I can't believe
you did that.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.257
Right back at you.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.976
Our patient's dying.
We need theories.

30:56.105 --> 30:58.141
It's gotta be
normal pressure
hydrocephalus.

30:58.274 --> 30:59.684
Andrews predicted
the coma.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.441
Yeah, but even
a broken doctor is
right twice a day.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.644
The patient wasn't
wet, wabbly or wacky.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.192
The coma had to
be a lucky guess.

31:07.283 --> 31:09.365
If you didn't
think he was right,

31:09.452 --> 31:11.659
then why did you
want us to collect
his spinal fluid?

31:11.787 --> 31:13.994
I didn't. I wanted you
to do a tilt table test.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.159
You have a wonderful
way of communicating.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.907
I knew Park wanted
to do a tilt table.

31:18.002 --> 31:21.369
If she listens to me,
I waste an hour,
if she defies me,

31:21.630 --> 31:24.497
then I get the test
I want and my 100 bucks.

31:24.633 --> 31:25.884
Up high.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.625
You're an ass.

31:28.137 --> 31:29.126
You're angry.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.133
Yes. Now I'm angry.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.344
Let's run the test
for normal pressure
hydrocephalus.

31:34.643 --> 31:35.678
No.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.135
What else would
explain our symptoms

31:38.230 --> 31:40.812
and make our patient go
into a coma during that test?

31:41.984 --> 31:43.599
What about
hepatic encephalopathy?

31:43.694 --> 31:46.481
No. We already
tested his liver enzymes.
They're normal.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.564
Or his Iiver's so far gone,
it can't even produce enzymes.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.201
That's desperate.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.033
It fits the symptoms.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.080
And Andrews is a hack.

31:55.498 --> 31:59.241
Go biopsy to confirm,
unless you want
your own hearing.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.826
You'd have to
hire me first.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.085
So you do realize
that it is unacceptable

32:10.179 --> 32:11.760
to hit someone
in the work place?

32:11.847 --> 32:14.338
CHI: Yes.
Completely unacceptable.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.090
I wasn't thinking.
Iguess”.

32:16.185 --> 32:19.348
I mean, I guess,
technically,
l was thinking.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.848
It happened so fast,
I didn't... I...

32:25.653 --> 32:26.688
It's like...

32:27.530 --> 32:32.274
It's like it wasn't even me.
I would never do
something like that.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.032
Even though I did.

32:35.538 --> 32:39.076
I'm sorry I'm not
making any sense right now.

32:41.043 --> 32:45.332
I don't know.
I just really love being
a doctor so much,

32:45.422 --> 32:49.756
and I barely even
have $100 and...

32:51.428 --> 32:53.589
Please don't fire me.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.062
AINSLEY: Is this theory
more promising
than the others?

33:04.483 --> 33:05.814
We'll know in a few hours.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.727
How are you holding up?

33:10.239 --> 33:12.821
Other than the fact
that my dad's in a coma,

33:13.742 --> 33:14.731
terrible.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.243
Tomorrow morning,
I am supposed to
sign a piece of paper

33:20.749 --> 33:23.786
and cost thousands of
employees their jobs.

33:24.253 --> 33:25.709
I thought you'd
rather see the company

33:25.796 --> 33:27.627
go under in New Jersey
than thrive in China.

33:29.592 --> 33:32.425
It's what my dad wants,
and it's still his company.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.672
I'm reallyjust
keeping the seat warm.

33:35.598 --> 33:38.260
But unless he wakes up
before tomorrow,

33:38.350 --> 33:41.638
it's gonna be my signature
on that piece of paper.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.313
You don't have to sign it.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.820
I'll let you know
when we have the results.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.463
Biopsy was clean.
It's not his liver.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.305
I also ran
the spinal fluid test,

34:20.476 --> 34:23.058
and you were right
that Andrews was wrong.

34:23.145 --> 34:25.807
His ICP was not normal,
it was elevated.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.480
What about HTLV?

34:28.734 --> 34:30.144
We ruled that out
three days ago.

34:30.319 --> 34:31.684
Because of
his heart problems.
But...

34:31.820 --> 34:33.401
Once something gets
taken off the board,

34:33.489 --> 34:35.150
I'm the only one
who's allowed to
put it back on.

Either we figure out
what's wrong with this guy,

34:55.010 --> 34:57.717

Thinking in here.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.677
Brain scans indicate
it could be Loa loa disease.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.108
Shut it off!

35:10.234 --> 35:11.440
(WHIRRING CONTINUES)

35:22.746 --> 35:25.032
Apparently we're
allowed to do this now.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.957
Get out of here, House.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.375
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.883
He'll wake up in an hour.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.392
It's been a pleasure
having you
in the neighborhood.

35:56.530 --> 35:57.645
(GRUNTS)

36:00.617 --> 36:03.279
This diagnosis was
brought to you
by the letter Y.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.824
Dad! God, you're okay.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.284
I'm thirsty.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.326
It's a side effect
of not dying.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.584
Turns out your blood
was getting thick and syrupy

36:16.675 --> 36:19.462
from complexes of large
Y-shaped antibodies.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.589
They were clogging up
your blood vessels,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.296
causing your organs
to shut down, one by one.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.677
Usual/y, with
h yperviscosity syndrome,

36:26.769 --> 36:28.509
it’s caused by
an elevated blood count

36:28.604 --> 36:31.016
or protein count,
but yours eluded us

36:31.190 --> 36:32.396
because it was
caused by antibodies

36:32.483 --> 36:34.019
from your
rheumatoid arthritis.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.815
Now that they’re
being filtered out,

36:35.944 --> 36:40.438
your blood will be
a little less duck sauce,
and a little more soy sauce.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.865
So I'm gonna be
completely cured?

36:44.578 --> 36:45.909
It's not all about you.

36:46.830 --> 36:51.164
Your stock price
will be completely cured
once you sign this.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.208
It's a press release.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.786
It says that you're healthy,
you're going back to work,

36:55.881 --> 36:58.418
and you're signing
the lease that officially
moves the company to China.

36:58.509 --> 37:02.093
He just woke up.
Dad, you don't have to
deal with this right now.

37:02.513 --> 37:06.552
Actually, he does.
Because the market
opens at 9:00 am.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.050
And this means
a lot to me.

37:09.978 --> 37:13.220
You may remember me
from the time
I saved your life.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.018
If you move it,
it'll be without me.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.909
I know you object,
I know you disagree...

37:27.204 --> 37:30.196
Dad. I can't do it.

37:34.378 --> 37:37.870
If this is
really about family,
you will not do this.

38:27.264 --> 38:28.299
Morning.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.391
I got lucky this time.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.559
No, you didn't.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.729
I made this bet so
you'd stop actively
trying to fire Park,

38:37.816 --> 38:41.058
so you'd be neutral.
You went out of
your way to help her.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.860
She obviously
earned your respect,
passed whatever test you...

38:43.947 --> 38:45.153
I sabotaged her hearing.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.105
You do read
the school paper,
don't you?

38:47.242 --> 38:49.449
(LAUGHS) If you had
sabotaged her hearing,

38:49.536 --> 38:51.367
she would have
gotten more than
a slap on the wrist.

38:51.455 --> 38:53.411
What you actually did
was make her emotional,

38:53.499 --> 38:55.035
and make the board members
see her as a victim.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.828
Because the panel
feels badly for

38:56.919 --> 38:59.035
incompetent doctors
who nearly kill people.

38:59.129 --> 39:00.869
You know that everyone
on that panel hates you.

39:01.298 --> 39:03.004
You know the minute you
recommend firing anyone,

39:03.091 --> 39:06.219
they start discussing
how big a bonus
to give them.

39:06.386 --> 39:07.762
That's just hurtful.

39:08.222 --> 39:11.385
Fact is,
winning $100 from you
gives me more pleasure

39:11.475 --> 39:12.840
than winning $100 from her.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.343
Here's your 5 grand.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.393
What 5 grand?

39:22.277 --> 39:23.858
Just take it.
Trust me.

39:30.327 --> 39:32.818
I found her
sleeping in the park.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.078
Says she ran away because
her daddy didn't love her.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.370
And that is
exactly what happened
as far as you can prove.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.503
Congratulations.
You're not going to jail.
Today.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.797
But you do know I just
can't let this slide.

39:45.926 --> 39:47.837
Well, you need to
keep up your rep.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.719
Fine, clinic hours.
I'll double them.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.046
Okay.
Twelve hours a week.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.679
No. Three times
two equals six.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.637
And three times
two times two is twelve.

40:00.357 --> 40:02.188
I know about
your deal with Adams.

40:07.364 --> 40:09.355
Call Chase and Taub.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.533
Get them in here.
The boys are back.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.746
This check is for
significantly more

40:18.875 --> 40:20.866
than what I told you
it would take to
fund the department.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.375
I know.

40:32.264 --> 40:33.549
You paged me?

40:52.117 --> 40:53.448
Congratulations.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.744
You caught your boyfriend
cheating that morning.

41:02.586 --> 41:06.044
You had a big fight,
that's why you were late.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.632
You re-pitched an STD.

41:11.553 --> 41:12.918
You haven't gone
two consecutive minutes

41:13.013 --> 41:14.378
without using
the word "loyalty",

41:14.598 --> 41:17.135
which explains the anger
and low self-esteem.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.090
And the desire
to feel pretty

41:19.186 --> 41:21.552
after having been rejected
explains the clothes.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.226
It wasn't my boyfriend.

41:29.446 --> 41:31.437
It was my husband.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.360
I was at my lawyer's office
signing the divorce papers.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.078
Wow.

41:39.289 --> 41:40.995
I missed the fact
that you were married.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.074
We've been separated
for almost a year.

41:45.337 --> 41:47.123
So... Old news?

41:48.006 --> 41:49.212
No anger left?

42:06.817 --> 42:08.899
It's all bought
and paid for.
