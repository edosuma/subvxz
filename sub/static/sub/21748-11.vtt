WEBVTT

00:11.010 --> 00:15.056
Slow down, Henrietta.
A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.434
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!

00:17.517 --> 00:19.853
My son is a ball of gas.

00:19.936 --> 00:23.606
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.
I'm the ball of gas!

00:23.690 --> 00:26.025
But you're also a star.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.527
Wait. Mom, do you remember--

00:27.610 --> 00:30.196
Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.

00:30.280 --> 00:34.075
Sun, you're a ball of gas,
but you're also a star.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.745
-We call you... "Sun."
-Ugh!

00:36.828 --> 00:39.414
Where are you taking me?
Are we going to the lake house?

00:39.497 --> 00:42.834
No, we're going
to a glorious magical place

00:42.917 --> 00:45.253
where they'll lock you
in a room by yourself

00:45.336 --> 00:47.255
so you can't hurt anyone ever again.

00:47.338 --> 00:50.049
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Why are you driving so slowly?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.676
-Hurry up!
-Wait. You just said--

00:51.760 --> 00:55.638
Time's arrow neither stands still
nor reverses, after all.

00:55.722 --> 01:00.143
It merely marches forward.
Isn't that right, Henrietta?

01:00.226 --> 01:02.437
Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.272
[humming]

01:06.316 --> 01:07.484
Well, here we are.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.194
-Here?
-Yes.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.362
[humming]

01:11.446 --> 01:12.697
Ugh!

01:25.210 --> 01:28.046
[theme music playing]

02:22.934 --> 02:24.602
-[wind gusting]
-[children laughing]

02:24.686 --> 02:25.895
[coughs]

02:25.979 --> 02:28.815
[laughter]

02:28.898 --> 02:30.400
Halt! No entry.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.944
-But I wanna slide.
-This is no mere slide.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.446
We three are members
of an elite society

02:35.530 --> 02:37.073
of extremely young women,

02:37.157 --> 02:41.035
led by I,
Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.537
You may not enter.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.956
-Yeah, and also you're fat.
-Oh!

02:45.039 --> 02:46.875
I'm not fat. [coughs]

02:46.958 --> 02:48.793
Even your lungs expostulate

02:48.877 --> 02:51.379
as they struggle to expel
your ample corpulence.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.132
She's saying your lungs
think you're fat too.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.967
Father says I'm just growing.

02:56.050 --> 03:01.055
If you do not halt, we will be forced
to physically impede your egress.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.100
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! Ow!

03:04.183 --> 03:05.435
[cries out]

03:05.518 --> 03:06.561
[grunts]

03:06.644 --> 03:09.314
-[girls laughing]
-[crying]

03:12.775 --> 03:15.403
Beatrice, stop reading
and put on your uniform.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.031
Father, I don't feel well.
[coughing]

03:18.114 --> 03:20.992
I don't care if you're scared
of Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle,

03:21.075 --> 03:22.577
you have to go to school.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.746
Now stop making books your friends.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.415
Reading does nothing for young women
but build their brains,

03:27.498 --> 03:30.919
taking valuable resources away
from their breasts and hips.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.005
-But my throat hurts.
-Uniform! Now!

03:34.088 --> 03:35.506
[moans]

03:35.590 --> 03:37.258
[sighs]

03:37.342 --> 03:39.719
Beatrice? Oh, my, you're hot.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.012
Dear Lord.

03:44.432 --> 03:48.144
[Joseph] Now listen here, it's
a mother's duty to keep her children alive

03:48.228 --> 03:49.938
and you are continually failing!

03:50.021 --> 03:53.191
How could you not have known
she has scarlet fever?

03:53.274 --> 03:55.860
Say something, damn it!
What has become of you?

03:55.944 --> 03:58.154
I swear if I'd known
this is how you'd behave

03:58.238 --> 04:01.032
once we severed the connections
to your prefrontal cortex,

04:01.115 --> 04:02.533
I'd hardly have bothered.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.245
-Father?
-[gasps] Yes, darling?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.704
Am I to die?

04:06.788 --> 04:09.165
Well, eventually yes,
but this illness is but a hiccup

04:09.249 --> 04:11.125
in what will be a long and happy life,

04:11.209 --> 04:12.835
-I promise.
-You promise?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.837
In fact, some good
may yet come of this.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.173
Doctor says your throat
is nearly swollen shut.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.217
So perhaps you'll finally lose
some of that weight

04:19.300 --> 04:20.551
that's given you such troubles.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.637
-Won't that be nice?
-Yes, Father.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.643
-Ow!
-Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.895
Polly, be a darling and fetch me
a pretty pill

04:30.979 --> 04:32.480
and a glass of water, won't you?

04:32.563 --> 04:34.315
Yes, Señorita Sugarman.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.609
Beatrice, you're looking well,
which is just fine,

04:36.693 --> 04:39.153
because your debutante party
is vitally important.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.823
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,

04:41.906 --> 04:44.492
or bring back civil rights
activist Medgar Evers,

04:44.575 --> 04:46.577
who was shot in Mississippi
this week?

04:46.661 --> 04:49.998
Yes! Or rather, it will end you
worrying about that nonsense

04:50.081 --> 04:51.582
because it will land you a husband.

04:51.666 --> 04:57.255
At least Evers' death means no one else
will be assassinated this year, 1963.

04:57.338 --> 05:01.050
The FBI is on too high alert to allow
anything like that to happen again.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.303
-Hmm?
-Yes... well...

05:03.386 --> 05:05.013
Your chaperone,
Corbin Creamerman,

05:05.096 --> 05:06.681
is a fine young man.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.891
Oh, jeez.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.228
-My lady. [chuckles] Here you go.
-Thanks.

05:14.647 --> 05:18.568
So... uh, you look nice.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.404
Thank you, Corbin.
That's the third time you've told me.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.864
You needn't tell me again.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.784
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at these things.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.787
But sometimes I am.
I can be. I-- I really try to be.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.498
I'm, well, I-- I'm not. I'm really not.
I don't know why.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.460
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.378
[Joseph]
Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,

05:37.462 --> 05:40.673
is founder of Creamerman's
Creamy Cream-based Commodities.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.177
Think of all the free iced cream
you could, uh, serve to other people.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.138
Father, do you aim to marry me off
to Corbin Creamerman

05:47.221 --> 05:49.265
merely because it would be good
for business?

05:49.348 --> 05:51.309
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas

05:51.392 --> 05:54.604
of how a Sugarman/Creamerman
alliance might be advantageous.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.897
-Uh-huh.
-For example,

05:55.980 --> 05:58.858
imagine a television advertisement
with a fun jingle.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.277
<i>♪ Have your morning coffee or tea ♪</i>

06:01.360 --> 06:03.029
<i>♪ With Sugarman and Creamerman ♪</i>

06:03.112 --> 06:05.156
<i>♪ But save some for... these fellas ♪</i>

06:05.239 --> 06:07.825
And then it's Mort and me,
and we're holding up our products

06:07.909 --> 06:11.579
with big smiles from across
a very ordinary looking kitchen table.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.874
Father, common Americans
don't want you on their TV sets.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.044
You're a reminder of the disparity
of wealth in this country.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.463
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.091
You know, I sent you to Barnard
to get your MRS

06:23.174 --> 06:25.301
from a fine upstanding Columbia man,

06:25.384 --> 06:27.220
but instead of a bachelor
you returned home

06:27.303 --> 06:30.473
with a bachelor's degree
and a mouth full of sass.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.058
What a waste!

06:32.141 --> 06:33.976
[sighs]

06:34.060 --> 06:36.354
-[Corbin] <i>You look nice.</i>
-Thank you.

06:36.437 --> 06:41.818
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?
Doth my eye belie me?

06:41.901 --> 06:45.530
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.
Why are you here?

06:45.613 --> 06:48.991
I must say,
it's tremendous you're finally debuting.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.619
Better late than never, hmm?
[chuckles]

06:51.702 --> 06:55.540
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,
who has very old-fashioned ideas

06:55.623 --> 06:57.583
about how a woman is to live her life.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.670
Poor Corbin here is saddled
with chaperoning me.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.921
Oh, I don't feel saddled.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.549
In truth,
I find these parties to be garish,

07:04.632 --> 07:06.884
self-serving wastes of money.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.471
Oh, and I'm sure yours
was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.722
[spits and coughs]

07:11.806 --> 07:15.101
Oh, my! How repugnant!

07:17.186 --> 07:19.856
Uh... scotch on the rocks.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.109
-Do I know you?
-[chuckles]

07:23.192 --> 07:26.362
Nope, just crashing some dumb
debutante's party. [chuckles]

07:26.446 --> 07:30.867
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"
to describe the party or the debutante?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.494
Because I might agree with you,
or I might be offended.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.496
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?

07:35.580 --> 07:38.207
Beatrice Sugarman.
Welcome to my dumb party.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.501
Butterscotch Horseman.
Charmed, I'm sure.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.794
You crash a lot of these?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.880
I'll take my free alcohol
where I can get it.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.006
Saving for California.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.257
What's in California?

07:46.340 --> 07:48.676
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.596
This is where you ask me
if those are towns, and I smirk at you.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.890
I am familiar with the Beats,
thank you.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.225
I like Ginsberg all right,
but if you ask me,

07:56.309 --> 07:58.269
that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.563
-What's your interest in them?
-What's my interest?

08:00.646 --> 08:02.565
They're the greatest minds
of our generation.

08:02.648 --> 08:06.194
I'm heading west to join them,
because I'm one of the greatest minds too.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.778
-I see.
-You will see.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.655
I'm writing the next
Great American Novel.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.491
Oh, what's it about?

08:11.574 --> 08:13.326
It's about truth! It's about war!

08:13.409 --> 08:16.787
It's about the twilighting frontier
of the lives that were promised us.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.457
But what is it about?
Who are the characters?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.167
I never claimed to have
the whole thing

08:21.250 --> 08:22.460
sorted out just yet, did I?

08:22.543 --> 08:23.753
Sounds like a best seller.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.797
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing
for a woman to be.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.592
I don't know how you expect
to nab a husband at a party like this

08:29.675 --> 08:30.843
with a personality like that.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.764
Oh, congratulations. You and my father
express the same concerns.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.349
[chuckles] If I were your old man,

08:36.432 --> 08:38.226
I'd be anxious
to get you married off, too.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.436
I bet your thank-you letters
are perfunctory,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.105
your flower arrangements
are uninspired,

08:43.189 --> 08:45.107
and your curtsy is an embarrassment.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.317
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

08:46.400 --> 08:48.903
Looks like you pegged me
as well as I pegged you.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.112
[clicks tongue]

08:50.196 --> 08:52.240
What must your mother think of you?

08:52.323 --> 08:55.701
Oh, she doesn't think much...
about anything, anymore.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.453
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.581
-No, not exactly.
-Mine did.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.291
I'm very sorry to hear that.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.544
I was little. I don't remember, really.

09:04.627 --> 09:08.422
But she had a diamond just like yours.
I saw it in a picture once.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.590
Oh...

09:09.674 --> 09:11.551
-[BoJack] Yes, this is my mother.
-What?

09:11.634 --> 09:12.677
I'd like to leave her here.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.222
Can I pay for the next five years now
so I don't have to think about her again?

09:16.305 --> 09:17.890
-Wha-- Oh.
-[Corbin] Oh, jeez, I--

09:17.974 --> 09:21.352
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we have to do the thing now,

09:21.435 --> 09:23.521
where we do the... things.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.773
Oh-- oh, right. Um...

09:25.856 --> 09:29.360
-Please excuse me.
-Of course, it sounds very important.

09:29.443 --> 09:33.197
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sugarman
present their daughter,

09:33.281 --> 09:35.783
Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.911
Chaperoned by Mr. Corbin C. Creamerman.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.081
Look at her go, folks.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.125
Clearing every hurdle.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.751
Look at that form.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.712
What precise movements.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.630
-[Beatrice] Five, six...
-[man] Beautiful trot.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.215
[softly] Truly outstanding.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.217
A lovely lady indeed.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.803
-Ta-da!
-[applause]

09:55.886 --> 09:58.055
[clears throat]
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.140
Oh...

10:01.559 --> 10:02.852
Excuse me.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.980
Don't you know it's rude to leave
without saying goodbye to the hostess?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.231
Why don't you come with me?

10:07.315 --> 10:10.318
It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,
thus eliminating my transgression.

10:10.401 --> 10:14.113
Oh! You want me to leave
my own party with you?

10:14.196 --> 10:16.407
The low-life who wasn't even invited?

10:16.490 --> 10:18.200
-[glass shatters]
-Yeah.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.494
But I suppose Daddy
wouldn't like that, would he?

10:23.372 --> 10:26.334
[both moaning]

10:26.417 --> 10:28.127
Oh, Beatrice. [sputters]

10:32.381 --> 10:35.092
-I have wonderful news.
-I'm reading.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.596
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.
He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.349
I am not interested
in Corbin Creamerman.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.976
I don't give a damn
where your interests lie!

10:44.060 --> 10:46.812
After the disappearing act you pulled
at your own party,

10:46.896 --> 10:49.649
you're lucky I don't fill a jar
with jellied beans

10:49.732 --> 10:52.735

And the way they make
non-dairy creamer

11:03.287 --> 11:06.582
is by replacing the milk fat
with vegetable oil.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.626
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.920
-Pretty nifty, huh?
-Is that so?

11:11.003 --> 11:14.507

-Not at all. I don't find <i>you</i> boring.

to talk about,

you talk about them.

Maybe you have a cousin,

who knows a doctor,

of the couple who moved to California?

13:09.747 --> 13:11.207
I can't say that I have.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.833
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.460
You see, they hardly knew each other,

13:14.543 --> 13:17.713
but they shared a certain sensitivity
and a taste for the unknown.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.216
They were living in a one-horse town,
so they headed west,

accommodate three horses.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.865
You think I enjoy groveling
to my own wife, hat in hand?

19:59.948 --> 20:02.451
If you weren't so neglectful
in your wifely duties...

20:02.534 --> 20:05.120
-Don't you dare.
-I'm sorry. What do--

20:05.204 --> 20:06.747
I don't know what to do. I...

20:06.830 --> 20:10.083
Please. Just--
just fix this for me, please.

20:12.252 --> 20:16.256
I know you hate me, Bea,
but please just think of the poor girl.

20:17.674 --> 20:20.385
[exhales] Oh, God.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.681
You're fired, of course.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.100
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Horseman.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.686
He was just so kind to me
and I felt so--

20:29.770 --> 20:32.856
Let me guess, he said you reminded him
of his dead mother.

20:32.940 --> 20:37.110
He said she had hair like mine.
He saw it in a picture once.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.487
[sighs]

20:38.570 --> 20:41.949
-Do you really want this child?
-I... I think so?

20:42.032 --> 20:44.743
It's a baby horse.
[chuckles] A girl.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.078
[sighs]

20:46.161 --> 20:50.624
I need help. I'm studying to be a nurse,
and tuition keeps going up.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.334
None of that is my fault.

20:52.417 --> 20:56.171
If I can just finish school
and get a job, it'll be okay.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.674
And who's going to care
for the baby while you work?

20:58.757 --> 21:00.342
Because God knows he won't.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.761
[sobbing]

21:02.844 --> 21:05.055
Well, don't do that.
What does that solve?

21:05.138 --> 21:08.016
I don't know what else to do,
Mrs. Horseman.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.311
All right. We'll pay for your tuition.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.730
-Really?
-Yes.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.233
And you'll give the baby up
for adoption.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.442
[gasps]

21:17.526 --> 21:18.694
No.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.029
You think you want this,
but you don't. Not like this.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.155
Mrs. Horseman--

21:22.239 --> 21:24.408
Don't throw away your dreams
for this child.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.703
Don't let that man poison your life
the way he did mine.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.414
You are going to finish your schooling
and become a nurse.

21:30.497 --> 21:32.666
You'll meet a man, a good man,
and you'll have a family,

21:32.749 --> 21:35.377
but please believe me,
you don't want this.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.296
Oh...

21:37.379 --> 21:39.381
Please, Henrietta,
you have to believe me.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.342
Please, don't do what I did.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.138
Mm-hmm.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.390
[panting and grunting]

21:48.473 --> 21:49.850
[screaming]

21:49.933 --> 21:51.268
[panting]

21:51.351 --> 21:52.644
[screaming]

21:55.188 --> 21:57.607
My-- My baby!
Where's my baby?

21:57.691 --> 21:59.276
[screaming]

21:59.359 --> 22:00.777
[crying]

22:00.861 --> 22:02.529
[screaming]

22:02.612 --> 22:04.031
[crying]

22:06.283 --> 22:07.701
[sighs]

22:07.784 --> 22:11.204
-Oh, look at you.
-[chuckles]

22:11.288 --> 22:13.915
-You did it, Henrietta.
-[panting]

22:13.999 --> 22:15.334
Oh, my God.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.295
[humming]

22:19.588 --> 22:21.840
No, no, no. No, please.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.508
Please don't. Stop.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.136
Stop! Why are you doing this?

22:26.219 --> 22:28.805
Beatrice, remember
what we say about crying?

22:28.889 --> 22:30.640
-Mm-hmm.
-Crying is stupid.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.101
But, Father,
tell them not to burn my things.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.938
But, darling, they have to.
Your sickness has infected everything.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.648
The hard part is over.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.692
Wait. Wait. I wanna hold her.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.569
-No. You'll get attached.
-Wait!

22:42.652 --> 22:45.280
It all must be destroyed
for your own good.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.449
-I need to hold her.
-This is for your own good.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.577
-But not my baby.
-Yes. Especially your baby.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.828
-Whoop!
-[gasps]

22:51.912 --> 22:53.080
See, doesn't that feel better?

22:53.163 --> 22:55.916
[Beatrice cries] No!

22:55.999 --> 22:57.542
My baby!

22:57.626 --> 22:59.211
Wait, please. I need to hold her.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.462
-No, no.
-[crying]

23:00.545 --> 23:03.048
Wait. No, please come back.
I need to hold her. Please.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.674
[screams]

23:04.758 --> 23:06.009
No!

23:06.093 --> 23:07.886
Come on now, be strong.

23:07.969 --> 23:10.430
You can't let your womanly emotions
consume you.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.974
You don't wanna end up
like your mother now, do you?

23:13.058 --> 23:14.684
[faint screaming in distance]

23:14.768 --> 23:16.812
-[sobs] No.
-I promise.

23:16.895 --> 23:20.816
One day this will
all be a pleasant memory.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.951
Best of luck. See ya never.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.330
-Who <i>is</i> that?
-[groans] Bye, Mom.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.499
BoJack?

23:37.582 --> 23:40.752
-Mom?
-BoJack? Is that you?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.212
Yeah, it's me.

23:42.295 --> 23:46.383
-Well, oh, what is this place?
-This is where you live now.

23:46.466 --> 23:49.010
-No. Is it? No.
-Mom...

23:49.094 --> 23:50.929
-Where are we, BoJack?
-I just told you.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.139
I don't understand.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.391
-Where... Where am I?
-You're...

23:56.560 --> 23:57.644
in Michigan.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.896
-Michigan?
-Yeah.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.107
-At the lake house.
-I am?

24:02.190 --> 24:04.818
It's a-- It's a warm summer night,

24:04.901 --> 24:08.405
and the fireflies are dancing
in the sky.

24:08.488 --> 24:11.449
And your whole family is here.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.327
And they're telling you
that everything is gonna be all right.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.998
Yes. That's right. What else?

24:18.081 --> 24:22.711
The crickets are-- are chirping,
and the lake is still,

24:22.794 --> 24:25.797
and the night is full of stars.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.842
I can see it. It's so clear.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.219
What are we doing here, BoJack?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.596
We're sitting on the back porch,

24:32.679 --> 24:35.557
and we're listening to your brother
play the piano,

24:35.640 --> 24:37.392
and we're eating ice cream.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.060
Vanilla ice cream.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.188
Yes. That's right.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.065
Oh, it's all so marvelous.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.859
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?

24:45.942 --> 24:47.861
Oh, BoJack.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.197
It's so...

24:51.281 --> 24:52.866
delicious.
