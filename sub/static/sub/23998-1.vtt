00:19.353 --> 00:22.778
<i>When their time came, he called them.</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:28.822
<i>One by one, the oldest among them
walked into the corn and were gone.</i>

00:39.331 --> 00:41.299
<i>Ruth feared He Who Walks Behind the Rows.</i>

00:43.085 --> 00:45.213
<i>Now, she began to hate him, too.</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:48.344
<i>He had taken her friends.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:51.931
<i>He had taken the boy she loved.</i>

00:59.309 --> 01:02.863
<i>She had nothing left
but the new life growing inside her.</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:06.025
<i>And he would not take that.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:13.286
<i>So, she did the only thing
she could think of.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:16.251
<i>Burn the corn.</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:32.096
<i>Burn He Who Walks Behind the Rows.</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:36.763
<i>Burn her past.</i>

01:40.851 --> 01:41.852
<i>And run.</i>

01:48.108 --> 01:49.655
Not yet.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.326
You can have him. You can have him.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.749
You can have him.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.760
Check this out.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.144
- How long you been up?
- I don't know. Half hour?

03:04.768 --> 03:06.395
Come on, Ruth, we got work to do.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.899
Did you just call me Ruth?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.447
Yeah. So, what?

03:10.565 --> 03:11.862
Whatever happened to "Mom"?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.154
Sounds like baby talk.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.581
<i>I thought Ruth was kinda crazy.</i>

03:24.705 --> 03:26.548
<i>We mostly lived in our truck.</i>

03:31.336 --> 03:33.550
I was thinking I could get
maybe 50 bucks for this?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.510
Yeah, right.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.929
- <i>It got old.</i>
- Take it to the office.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.446
I'm so glad that we're in a hotel.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.616
Do you know snakes
can breathe from their tongue?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.870
Mm-hm.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.383
- You're wasting water, you know.
- I know.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.381
Isn't it wonderful?

04:22.721 --> 04:24.815
No. Don't.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.894
No, don't. You should finish. Hurry up.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.566
Get off of me! Stop!

04:31.646 --> 04:36.152
Ugh! I just faked it.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.346
Fuck. Goddamn it. Fucker.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.484
<i>For the flesh desires
what is contrary to the spirit,</i>

05:14.564 --> 05:17.534
<i>and the spirit,
what is contrary to the flesh.</i>

05:18.193 --> 05:20.696
<i>But are there any who still doubt</i>

05:20.779 --> 05:23.783
<i>that the wages of sin is death?</i>

05:23.865 --> 05:25.454
I hate all that religious crap.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.413
Don't you miss anybody?

05:29.955 --> 05:31.752
Don't you ever wanna stop?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.835
- Meet people?
- No.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.841
I wanna go to a school. A real school.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.925
<i>Where you go, I will go.</i>

05:42.133 --> 05:43.385
<i>And where you stay...</i>

05:45.971 --> 05:49.766
<i>...where you die, where you live...</i>

05:50.851 --> 05:52.063
<i>Ruth.</i>

05:52.143 --> 05:55.488
- Did you turn that back on?
- Huh?

05:56.731 --> 05:57.569
Nothing.

06:00.819 --> 06:01.820
Shit.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.958
Ma'am, can I ask you
to turn off the engine, please?

06:16.334 --> 06:17.506
Where y'all headed?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.339
Nowhere in particular.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.773
I don't suppose you packed
your license and registration.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.032
You were weaving like a cut cat back there.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.915
Can I ask you to step outside, please?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.330
Stay here.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.626
Follow me back here.
You just stay there, son.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.432
- Will we get our truck back?
- I don't know.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.522
Maybe it's a good excuse to stay put.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.399
Really? You mean it?

07:17.479 --> 07:18.697
I don't know. Maybe.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.653
Like, permanent?

07:21.733 --> 07:26.446
No. Like, a couple few weeks
till we get this truck thing sorted out.

07:27.739 --> 07:28.661
Okay.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.246
I got this.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.090
Hey, Mom. Over here.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.589
Hello?

07:43.672 --> 07:44.764
Back here.

07:46.049 --> 07:46.925
Help you?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.182
I'm here about the mechanic job.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.933
You got experience?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.311
- Some.
- Such as?

07:54.391 --> 07:56.143
Um...

07:56.226 --> 07:59.730
- Salvage, mostly.
- Yeah.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.316
We fix cars here.
We don't strip 'em for parts.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.655
I got a truck. It's got,
like, a million miles on it.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.948
Never once been in a shop.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.406
- That's all well and good.
- Not once.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.583
I need the money.

08:23.294 --> 08:26.264
Listen, I run a business here.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.134
Not a charity.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.222
Hope things work out for you.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.571
I'm sorry.

08:43.732 --> 08:47.453
It's just the way it is. We can't help that.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.538
Ruth, look out! Get back!

08:56.077 --> 08:57.545
Careful there, son.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.670
You don't wanna crack a lady's skull
on your back swing.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.714
Get your stuff and come on.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.140
It's...

09:14.220 --> 09:18.100
It's nothing fancy, but it's dry.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.436
- It's all good.
- Thank you.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.566
What's with all the old bikes outside?

09:24.022 --> 09:28.494
My kid, she, uh... she used to collect 'em.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.371
I put 'em together.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.372
That was our deal.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.498
She and her mom got run down by a drunk.

09:50.632 --> 09:54.227
Don't forget, you're out of here at sunrise.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.304
I got it.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.312
And if I see anything missing...

10:23.915 --> 10:26.168
Cut 'em down, plant the seed,
spread their blood...

10:26.251 --> 10:28.003
Mom?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.300
Cut 'em down, plant the seed,
spread their blood,

10:30.380 --> 10:33.008
watch Him feed, bleed and die,
then cut 'em down.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.267
Cut 'em down and plant the seed
and spread their blood.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.185
Mom.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.144
Cut them down, plant the seed,
spread their blood.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.399
Mom.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.482
Watch and feed, bleed and die.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.034
Bleed and die, bleed and die.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.744
Mom.

11:00.368 --> 11:03.122
Oh, my God. Aaron.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.793
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.876
Aaron, why did you sneak up on me like that?

11:06.958 --> 11:09.172
I didn't. I was talking the whole time.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.256
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.681
What were you doing?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.519
I just... I couldn't sleep, so I...

11:19.262 --> 11:21.731
It doesn't matter. Let's get you to bed.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.810
I can't sleep either.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.649
Fair enough.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.337
Get on over here!

13:31.269 --> 13:32.270
Hi there.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.064
What's your name?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.646
That was weird.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.226
What?

14:13.019 --> 14:15.191
You can go ahead and take your lunch now.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.648
Oh, no, it's... we're good.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.404
Hey, hey, um...

14:19.442 --> 14:22.365
Josephine's, across the street,

14:22.445 --> 14:23.992
does a pretty mean burger.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.374
Hmm.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.164
Thanks.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.245
You coming?

14:44.884 --> 14:48.684
Order whatever you want. Your mom has a job.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.079
You'd think we're on the deck
of the <i>Titanic</i> or something.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.332
The specials, they're up on the white board,

15:12.412 --> 15:16.052
except for the chicken fried chicken,
and we are out of that.

15:16.533 --> 15:19.957
- How about that fried chicken?
- That we got.

15:20.038 --> 15:22.631
How can you have fried chicken
but not have chicken fried chicken?

15:22.713 --> 15:24.716
Is he gonna be trouble or what?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.890
Your toast is burning.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.267
I don't cook.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.475
Hey, doll, how about my five over easy?

15:36.853 --> 15:38.066
Here you go, sweetheart.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.443
Over easy with a side of toast, well done.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.868
What about my bacon? I always have bacon.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.323
Well?

15:45.403 --> 15:48.990
Think I'll get the onion burger and fries
with the chocolate shake.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.666
That's a good call.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.021
Here you go. This will clear the cobwebs.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.252
No!

17:20.665 --> 17:23.378
- Hey, hey.
- Ow! You hurt me.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.797
What'd that lady do?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.674
I'm so sorry. I'm...

17:26.753 --> 17:28.968
I thought... I'm so sorry.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.550
You okay?

17:30.633 --> 17:33.011
Come on, Rally, you just go and sit down.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.766
Thanks for distracting everybody
from the crappy job I'm doing.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.100
Come on, get that crazy bitch
the hell out of here.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.062
Excuse me, Rally, but in this confusion,

17:42.144 --> 17:45.231
did I miss the part where you bought
this shithole and became my boss?

17:45.314 --> 17:47.153
You seen what she did.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.861
Now, sit your fat ass
back down on that stool.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.703
Hey, Rally, don't take that shit.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.708
Are you all right there, hit girl?

18:01.622 --> 18:02.794
Yeah, I'm all right.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.964
You didn't have to stick up
for me back there.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.763
Oh. I sure as hell did.

18:11.382 --> 18:14.761
You know, you are not from around this town,

18:14.844 --> 18:16.972
which automatically makes you
my favorite customer.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.442
Did you hear the locust again?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.448
Whenever you hear that sound,
whatever happens next, it's not real.

18:35.531 --> 18:39.411
No, I know, but this time was different. I...

18:39.493 --> 18:42.208
I don't know why.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.541
Different like... different how?

18:45.875 --> 18:51.093
Different like the difference between
a painting and a photograph.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.346
You go back in there and finish your burger.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.850
What about you?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.183
I gotta go to work. I'm fine.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.896
- Ruth.
- Go.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.134
Who's in there?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.655
I'm gonna find you.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.787
You little shit.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.803
Been over a year since the old man kicked.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.807
And his kids are still bickering
over what to do with the place.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.933
I love it just the way it is.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.568
You have no idea what this means to us.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.570
Oh, I... I imagine I do.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.865
I get the bedroom at the top of the stairs!

22:42.945 --> 22:45.493
I gotta get back to the shop.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.576
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.922
I'm counting on it.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.597
You know what? I'm thinking
about putting you in school.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.643
Here, in Luther?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.317
Looks like we may be here
a while. What do you think?

23:15.060 --> 23:16.312
Yeah, cool.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.240
Good night, dream boy.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.562
What are you doing here?

25:11.010 --> 25:14.640
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.570
No!

26:00.517 --> 26:01.730
Time to get up.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.442
Get dressed. You got a big day ahead.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.156
You're the one that wanted
to go to a real school.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.908
We will need proof of residency.

26:16.825 --> 26:17.917
Like what?

26:19.703 --> 26:25.295
Current utility bill,
a lease, mortgage agreement...

26:25.375 --> 26:29.012
Something that verifies
that you live in the school district.

26:29.797 --> 26:30.843
I don't have that.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.595
We just got here a couple days ago, so...

26:33.675 --> 26:35.639
Sorry.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.767
We'll be happy to process your application

26:38.847 --> 26:41.316
when you have the proper documentation.

26:42.518 --> 26:45.983
Are you telling me that
if I don't have a real home,

26:46.063 --> 26:48.066
I can't put my kid in your school?

26:48.148 --> 26:50.742
I don't make the rules, Ms. Clawson.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.822
And by the way,

26:54.905 --> 26:57.750
we haven't even gotten to the hard part yet.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.872
What's the hard part?

27:00.786 --> 27:04.001
Proof of parental status.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.458
Excuse me?

27:06.875 --> 27:10.846
Aaron, can you step outside
for just a second?

27:17.386 --> 27:18.387
Thank you.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.820
If you wanna shack up
with that colored boy...

27:28.230 --> 27:31.109
- that's your business.
- What are you saying?

27:31.191 --> 27:35.950
I'm saying that maybe you should think twice
about setting down roots here in Luther.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.621
Maybe you should just...

27:40.701 --> 27:46.299
take your little circus of crazy
and hit the road.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.595
And what if I don't?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.802
We don't like trouble.

27:54.882 --> 27:59.638
We are a peaceful,
God-fearing town, Ms. Clawson.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.222
Mm, yeah, I can tell.

28:02.848 --> 28:03.849
Well, then...

28:05.475 --> 28:07.022
It was really nice meeting you.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.248
It's a fine boy you have here.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.701
You should be proud.

29:17.881 --> 29:18.882
Look at them,

29:18.966 --> 29:22.095
their holier-than-thou attitudes.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.600
It's like they've never seen an unwed mother

29:24.680 --> 29:26.353
sucker punch a defenseless kid before.

29:27.516 --> 29:31.064
Look, I just...
I wanted to say how sorry I am.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.147
No, are you kidding? You did me a favor.

29:33.230 --> 29:37.613
Those little bastards come in here every
weekend just to hang out, never spend a dime.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.911
Oh, I'm Sarah, by the way.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.657
Ruth. This is Aaron.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.747
How about another onion burger
there, "A-ron"?

29:46.827 --> 29:48.249
Yeah.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.387
Call me anytime.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.595
She would if she ever got a phone.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.681
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:06.763 --> 30:10.938
You two lovebirds down there, when you're
finished with your lesbian love act,

30:11.018 --> 30:13.732
I could sure as hell use
some goddamn warm-up here.

30:13.812 --> 30:14.734
Please.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.317
Excuse me, duty calls.

30:18.608 --> 30:22.449
Hey, Sarah, you reckon Mr. Hatcherson minds

30:22.529 --> 30:24.868
you comping all of those people up there?

30:24.948 --> 30:27.663
- Who said I was comping 'em?
- I know what you're doing.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.164
You're stealing his fucking money.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.998
Those freebies, they add up, girl.

30:32.080 --> 30:36.755
Well, thank you, Crusty,
for looking out for my job security.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.087
- You're a real sweetheart.
- Ahh!

30:38.170 --> 30:40.592
- You crazy bitch! You burned me!
- I'll get that.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.551
You burned the hell out of me! Goddamn!

30:43.633 --> 30:46.637
You know, I'd be happy to comp that for you.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.190
Damn. Yeah, you comp everybody else.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.856
Oh, I gotta get you that onion burger.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.563
This man looks like he's starving.

30:56.646 --> 31:01.571
Um, I gotta get to work, but I can be
back in an hour or so and pick him up.

31:01.651 --> 31:04.764
Yeah, don't worry about it.
He can hang here as long as he wants.

31:04.845 --> 31:08.287
- You sure?
- Yeah. We'll be just fine.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.119
Look, best buds already.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.715
I just... I don't wanna put you out
any more than I've already...

31:16.917 --> 31:19.006
We're fine, Mom. Go.

31:19.086 --> 31:22.050
Yeah, Mom. <i>Hasta la vista.</i>

31:22.130 --> 31:24.094
Okay.

31:24.174 --> 31:27.144
Okay. Um, great. I'll...

31:29.471 --> 31:31.815
I'll be back... later.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.600
Here you go.

32:17.727 --> 32:21.732
You know, I get the feeling
that there's some stuff going on

32:21.815 --> 32:24.488
between the two of you that...

32:24.568 --> 32:28.573
I don't know, it just doesn't
come out in words.

32:31.324 --> 32:34.623
Living life on the road
just the two of y'all,

32:34.703 --> 32:36.080
it must be tough, right?

32:39.708 --> 32:42.712
I mean, just not having
your own personal space,

32:42.794 --> 32:45.384
time for yourself.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.682
Friends.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.810
Shoot, I bet you'd kill
to have a normal life.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.104
Yeah, kinda.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.010
You smell good.

33:36.056 --> 33:37.103
Like oil soap.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.113
Where are you from?

33:54.241 --> 33:55.288
What do you mean?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.880
I don't know. Like, where'd you grow up?

34:00.872 --> 34:04.672
- Where's your family from?
- Nebraska.

34:04.876 --> 34:09.052
- Ah, you're a corn husker.
- A what?

34:09.965 --> 34:11.183
You're empty.

34:12.425 --> 34:13.266
Hmm?

34:16.471 --> 34:19.060
Oh, yeah, um...

34:19.139 --> 34:20.391
How'd that happen?

34:32.320 --> 34:36.041
You don't much like
talking about yourself, do you?

34:37.951 --> 34:38.793
Uh-uh.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.424
Mystery girl.

35:17.282 --> 35:20.457
I don't know. Haven't done that for a while.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.924
We don't have to do this.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.360
Oh, watch my leg, watch my leg.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.909
- Are you okay?
- No, no, come on, I'm real good.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.122
No, no, no.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.550
- You good?
- Yeah.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.103
- Okay.
- Ow!

36:21.805 --> 36:23.226
- Sorry.
- You all right?

36:23.306 --> 36:25.058
Yeah, I'm fine, yeah. Yeah, it's great.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.489
Oh, my God. No, get out of here.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.698
What the hell's wrong with you?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.289
Son, why don't you just...
just go on back to your room?

36:46.371 --> 36:47.543
Everything's fine down here.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.460
You need to leave, Carl.

36:54.254 --> 36:57.599
You know what? You got
a problem, and it ain't me.

36:58.842 --> 36:59.843
Get out.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.894
I've been nothing but decent
to you. Both of you.

37:46.723 --> 37:47.724
Aaron?

37:51.019 --> 37:52.396
Aaron!

37:59.194 --> 38:00.195
Aaron!

38:44.072 --> 38:47.326
I don't know what happened. Um... I just...

38:50.537 --> 38:52.039
We were talking and...

38:52.997 --> 38:56.046
and he just started to get
all sweet on me, and I...

39:01.047 --> 39:02.048
It was nothing.

39:08.805 --> 39:10.352
Did you love my father?

39:14.018 --> 39:15.019
I think so.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.612
I don't know. It was so long ago.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.327
Do you miss having a man around?

39:33.663 --> 39:35.461
Not when I have you around.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.299
You're the only thing that matters.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.506
You always will be.

40:03.735 --> 40:04.577
Hey.

40:06.946 --> 40:07.947
Um...

40:09.073 --> 40:11.371
- About last night, I...
- It was nothing.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.414
I can't have somebody working for me

40:15.496 --> 40:17.624
that doesn't look me in my eye
when I'm talking!

40:19.751 --> 40:20.878
Better?

40:23.963 --> 40:25.715
Yeah, better.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.694
Hey! Come on, Crusty. Really?

40:47.070 --> 40:49.448
Here. Why don't you take him outside?

41:00.041 --> 41:04.968
<i>Hey, that thing, the sound
you were hearing, it's them?</i>

41:06.255 --> 41:08.553
<i>How did you know about that?</i>

41:08.633 --> 41:10.431
Um, Aaron told me.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.225
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

41:14.305 --> 41:18.060
I didn't mean to pry. I just...
He worries about you sometimes.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.143
I'm fine.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.738
Don't be angry with him. He's a good kid.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.697
I get to decide when to be angry with him.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.336
I gotta get back to work. You coming?

41:45.169 --> 41:46.796
Haven't finished my burger yet.

41:46.879 --> 41:49.257
- Here, I can take it...
- No, it's fine.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.219
Stay. Finish.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.488
What's that?

42:48.232 --> 42:50.826
- Nothing.
- Let me see.

42:56.199 --> 42:58.122
That girl teach you how to do this?

43:00.411 --> 43:02.163
What? It's okay. I just wanna know.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.375
Look. Hey. It doesn't matter.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.922
I just wanna know
who taught you how to do that.

43:08.002 --> 43:09.003
You did.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.723
Aaron, are you in there?

44:44.140 --> 44:47.394
Aaron. Aaron, you need
to open the door. Aaron.

45:06.204 --> 45:08.457
- Don't!
- Aaron, I wanna close it.

45:08.539 --> 45:09.540
Just...

45:10.708 --> 45:11.709
don't.

45:17.632 --> 45:21.307
- I said...
- I'm your mother.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.191
God.

46:18.192 --> 46:20.031
Yeah. No, no, no, we... Yeah.

46:20.111 --> 46:23.284
We'll send a truck out to you. Yeah. Again.

46:23.364 --> 46:26.539
All right. I apologize. All right.

46:28.286 --> 46:31.210
That was Ms. Carruthers. Ring a bell?

46:32.206 --> 46:34.545
- Gray Stratus.
- Yeah.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.423
Well, you changed the oil,

46:37.503 --> 46:39.842
but forgot to put the cap back on.

46:39.922 --> 46:42.801
She got halfway to El Reno
before the engine seized.

46:42.883 --> 46:44.760
That's... That's not possible.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.018
Doesn't much matter.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.269
Wait.

46:54.103 --> 46:56.731
You're not firing me over this.
There's no way.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.817
I'm the best mechanic you've ever had.

46:58.899 --> 47:02.074
I'm sorry, Ruth. This just ain't working out.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.242
Which part?

47:04.322 --> 47:07.370
Screwing up the job or not screwing the boss?

47:07.450 --> 47:08.918
I really wouldn't go there.

47:14.790 --> 47:18.090
I'll pay you through the week,
and that's me being generous.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.553
You can't do this.

47:23.424 --> 47:25.096
Well, now,

47:25.176 --> 47:28.396
I guess it's your turn to get the hell out.

48:36.163 --> 48:37.415
What are you doing?

48:55.850 --> 48:58.023
Pernell thinks his soup's cold.

49:05.985 --> 49:08.283
Goddamn it!

49:15.536 --> 49:17.379
That was good.

49:31.260 --> 49:35.686
All right, well, two hours, please.

49:38.142 --> 49:39.269
What the...

49:57.870 --> 49:59.873
What is she doing here?

50:00.956 --> 50:02.879
It's the woman I told you about.

50:13.177 --> 50:16.431
You can't be here! Hey!

50:18.307 --> 50:19.308
You can't be here.

50:59.139 --> 51:00.853
Who's there?

51:00.933 --> 51:01.775
Hel...

51:05.229 --> 51:06.230
What do you want?

51:11.777 --> 51:12.778
Hey.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.327
What?

51:20.411 --> 51:22.584
You mind telling me what you're looking for?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.883
Get on out of here. Get!

51:31.505 --> 51:32.427
What?

51:35.801 --> 51:38.516
Oh, son of a bitch!

51:38.596 --> 51:39.723
I swear...

51:44.018 --> 51:47.898
God!

52:54.963 --> 52:56.260
Somebody help me!

54:44.281 --> 54:45.203
Why?

54:46.200 --> 54:48.328
Why? Why?

55:48.846 --> 55:53.395
Cut them down, plant the seed,
spread their blood, watch Him feed.

55:53.475 --> 55:57.900
Cut them down, plant the seed,
spread their blood, watch Him feed.

55:57.980 --> 56:02.861
Bleed and die, bleed and die.
Bleed and die, bleed and die.

56:02.943 --> 56:07.159
Cut them down, plant the seed,
spread their blood, watch Him feed.

56:07.239 --> 56:12.122
Cut them down, plant the seed,
spread their blood, watch Him feed.

56:12.202 --> 56:13.294
Ah!

56:28.635 --> 56:29.477
Aaron?

56:35.517 --> 56:36.894
Aaron!

57:28.737 --> 57:31.201
Aaron! Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

57:31.281 --> 57:33.659
I saw you run into the woods
so I followed you.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.710
I saw what you were doing with those kids.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.458
I don't know what you're talking about.

57:38.538 --> 57:39.539
Aaron!

58:15.158 --> 58:17.122
Mommy's gonna get some medicine, okay, Aaron?

58:20.914 --> 58:24.129
You stay here. Mommy's gonna
be right back, okay?

58:24.209 --> 58:26.052
It's okay, baby. It's all right.

58:51.319 --> 58:52.616
I'm sorry, Aaron.

58:55.198 --> 58:59.453
I would do anything
to save you, my beautiful boy.

59:20.891 --> 59:21.892
Hey, Joe.

59:29.357 --> 59:30.779
Hey, you're up early.

59:32.069 --> 59:35.949
- I need your help.
- Uh, sure. Are you okay?

59:36.448 --> 59:39.246
I know I have no right
to burden you with this.

59:39.326 --> 59:42.374
Uh, do you wanna go somewhere
where we could be alone?

59:42.454 --> 59:45.082
No, no, it's okay. He can hear this.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.551
I want him to hear this.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.469
Have you ever heard of Gatlin, Nebraska?

59:54.549 --> 59:58.307
Yeah, where they had that
mass killing a decade or so ago.

59:58.845 --> 01:00:01.189
One of the children heard a voice.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:04.272
And they thought that voice
came from God, but it didn't.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.441
It was something else.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.525
And so, all these children
began to follow this...

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.529
this...

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.947
Yeah, I remember.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:20.620
I was one of those kids.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.919
Didn't they all set fire to themselves?

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.422
Not all of 'em.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:33.009
When I got pregnant with Aaron,
things changed.

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.600
And I realized they wanted him.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.683
After Gatlin, we just kept moving around.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:45.479
We never stayed in one place more
than a day or two at a time, and...

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.691
I don't know, I just felt
like we were being... followed.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:54.696
Not by any one person

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:57.905
but by different people in different places.

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:01.286
How could you tell?

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.994
You just... you kinda get a sense of things.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:07.922
I don't... I don't really know
how to explain it, but they, um...

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:19.180
I need you to do something for me. One thing.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.891
Just one thing, and I can handle the rest.

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:27.021
Get my son as far away from here
as you possibly can.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.359
I need you to do this for me, Sarah, please.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:35.862
I... I don't know.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.406
- I don't know what to say.
- Just get him away from here.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:42.953
I know that I have no right to put this
on you, but he cannot be here, not now.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.746
You could both leave together.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:47.499
No, I have to do something,
and it can't involve Aaron.

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:48.580
What?

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:51.708
There's someone in this town.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.630
She's gonna do something terrible.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.928
How do you know?

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.798
I know how she thinks.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.304
You know how crazy that sounds.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.511
Then if I'm crazy,

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:06.643
that is even more reason for you
to get my son to a safer place.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:07.850
Please.

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.229
I don't know.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:12.107
Look, I've done something awful,
Sarah, 13 years ago.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.439
And I can't take it back.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.363
All that I can do is make sure
it never happens again, ever.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:23.740
This is the last thing that I have
that I can give to this world, to my son.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.287
Now, I'm asking,

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:29.372
I'm begging you, please,
help me make this right.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:30.296
Okay.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.841
I got this stick-for-brains ex up in Tulsa.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.674
He's a total loser, but he's great with kids.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:47.268
I can take him there.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:52.606
Thank you so much. You are a total godsend.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.358
No problem.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:59.735
Okay, one tiny problem.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.453
- What?
- I don't have a car.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:15.338
Oh, hey, I have an appointment
for a root canal in 22 minutes.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.380
Uh, it's the pea green Hyundai.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:22.636
That one right there. I have
to be in the city by 8:00,

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:25.060
and with rush hour the way it is...

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.432
Shirke, Candy Shirke.

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:31.853
I have the estimate right here. Oh...

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:35.607
I'm in for a broken fan belt,
a new radiator hose,

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.314
and you were gonna check the bushings, too.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.444
I get this grindy noise when I accelerate,

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.652
- especially on cold...
- Carl?

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.657
I really can't afford to be late.

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.825
He promised that the car
would be ready at 7:30...

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:46.747
Shut up!

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:54.664
Carl?

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:03.908
They'll think I did this.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.113
That's the plan, right?

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:17.664
Come out.

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.096
Come out!

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:50.323
- This what we got?
- Yeah.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:52.953
Let's go.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:57.040
I'll come for you. I promise, okay?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.622
Be careful there, hit girl.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:50.320
Whenever I'm up here, I'm just struck

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.653
by the perfection of it all.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:59.376
Little farmers down there sowing
their fields every spring.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:05.499
You know, if you're quiet,
you can actually hear the corn growing.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:09.670
And then comes the harvest,
and it starts all over again.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:14.553
It's... It's a beautiful thing.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.765
We're not going to Tulsa, are we?

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.723
Nope.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:22.807
Didn't think so.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.227
Oh, God.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.741
What are you doing here?

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.410
You little whore! Bitch!

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.461
You're not real. You're not real.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.339
Oh, you're not real. You're not real.

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:23.348
You're not real. You're not real.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:24.930
You're not real.

01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:33.691
Why did you do this to me?

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:37.241
Let go! Let go! Let me go!

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.203
No!

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:58.463
Ruth.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:23.593
Sooner or later, you have
to deal with it, sweetie.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:26.176
You're still part of us.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:30.099
- And we're still part of you.
- No. No.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:34.103
No? Then why keep using
your biblical name, Ruth,

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.686
and not the name that your parents gave you?

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.022
What was it again?

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.283
Sandra, I think it was.

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:44.118
Sandy.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:46.703
Where's my son?

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.120
He's doing just fine.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:53.620
We're already getting along like soulmates.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.759
Did you know he's never read
the Bible? Not a page.

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:01.798
I want him back.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.472
You don't really want that.
Not in your condition.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.432
I mean, look at yourself.

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:09.222
Is that the face of a responsible mother?

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:27.070
Sweetie, come here.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:36.165
Remember how it felt

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:39.293
when you sliced open your mother's throat?

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:40.966
You watched her bleed out.

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:46.889
And that look of utter surprise.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.396
You kept that lock of hair
as a keepsake, remember?

01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:00.110
Of all your childhood mementos,

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:03.781
this was the one that you couldn't part with.

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.280
Death was such a mystery back then.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:15.501
It still is. It just comes
a lot easier now, doesn't it?

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:18.955
Those poor kids.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:24.127
<i>Your brothers and your sisters</i>

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.757
<i>trapped in a cornfield...</i>

01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:27.755
burning alive.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.849
I want my son.

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.180
Well, we're gonna have to get over that.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.601
I want my son!

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:38.978
I know you want what's best for Aaron.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.646
Where is he?

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:41.727
He's here.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.439
He's downstairs.

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:45.985
What?

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.029
What? No. No.

01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:50.112
He can't... He can't see this.

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:57.118
Aaron.

01:14:58.536 --> 01:14:59.537
Please, baby.

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:04.883
- I'm sorry.
- Be careful what you wish for.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.423
What did you do?

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:13.509
Come here.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.429
Please. Baby, please.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:26.148
Mommy... Mommy is sick. You were right.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.658
I know that now.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:31.657
Everything is much, much clearer now.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.994
No, don't! Don't, don't, don't! Why...

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:39.749
You're afraid of me. I... I get that.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.626
But I'm your mother.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:46.585
And I need you to listen, okay?

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.169
I have something I gotta tell you.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:52.506
Sarah...

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:57.554
...is not who you think she is, okay?

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.476
You gotta stay away from her, you understand?

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.770
You understand what I'm saying?
Just keep away from her.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.648
She's not your friend. She's your enemy.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:09.443
She's who we've been running
from for your entire life.

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.615
You understand me?

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.573
She's the darkness.

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:31.424
Promise me,

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:35.011
promise me, the second that I let go,

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:37.344
that you are gonna run, okay?

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:41.934
That you're gonna run,
you're gonna run and run and run,

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.228
and you're never gonna look back, okay?

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:47.812
You promise, okay?

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:49.358
I love you.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.439
I love you.

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:53.654
I love you too.

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:59.342
<i>Cut them down, plant the seed.</i>

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:01.845
<i>Spread their blood,</i>

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.600
<i>watch Him feed.</i>

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:08.483
<i>And bleed and die.</i>

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:12.279
<i>And bleed and die.</i>

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:20.280
<i>In the end, Ruth finally understood.</i>

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.828
<i>She wasn't running away from her destiny.</i>

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:26.912
<i>She was running to it.</i>

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:30.918
- <i>And I am, too.</i>
- ...must be cut down

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:34.630
so that what is pure
and unspoiled may take its place.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:38.050
Lord, give me thy strength

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:41.422
to seek out which is impure,
that which is unholy,

01:18:41.503 --> 01:18:45.391
that which dishonors thy name
in treachery and betrayal.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:50.102
Let me by thy sword,
by thy sickle, and by thy fire!

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:53.529
Lord, let thy righteous fury guide my hand

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:57.695
until the land is once again cleansed of sin,

01:18:57.775 --> 01:19:00.197
until the fields are ready to be sown again,

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:02.405
nourished by the blood of the corrupted souls

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:05.037
that walk among us even now.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:15.343
To your will, I commit myself,
body and soul...

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.170
for time eternal.
