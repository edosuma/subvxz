00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.291 --> 00:08.000
( tender pop music playing )

01:11.667 --> 01:13.083
I have to go to work.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.041
And I feel used.
Gabriel.

01:17.083 --> 01:20.083
We were at a wedding,
we got carried away, that's all.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.000
Move to D.C. with me.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.375
Oh. Thanks.

01:35.542 --> 01:36.875
That's where
I'm going too.

01:36.917 --> 01:39.041
The doctors there
aren't expensive, are they?

01:39.083 --> 01:40.333
I'm already working
at a bar

01:40.375 --> 01:42.041
to put myself
through grad school.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.333
Don't worry. Our patients
are our first priority.

01:44.375 --> 01:47.625
So you're one of the doctors?
Yes. I'm Dr. Montgomery.

01:47.667 --> 01:51.291
Oh. You're the one I'm coming
to see. I'm Patty--

01:51.333 --> 01:53.041
( groans )

01:53.083 --> 01:55.041
Patty? What is it?
Oh, my stomach.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.458
( gagging )

01:56.500 --> 01:59.917
Okay. Okay.
It's okay.

01:59.959 --> 02:02.000
It's okay, Patty.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.959
What did you give me?
I feel better.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
It's an antiemetic.
Helps with the nausea.

02:10.125 --> 02:11.333
( winces )

02:11.375 --> 02:12.750
That's tender?

02:12.792 --> 02:15.000
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna do an ultrasound.

02:15.041 --> 02:17.041
Have you had
any other symptoms lately?

02:17.083 --> 02:19.000
Any recent changes in health?

02:20.083 --> 02:21.709
Patty, what is it?

02:23.083 --> 02:24.709
I had an abortion
two months ago.

02:24.750 --> 02:30.250
I tried to go to this clinic,
but outside were all these...

02:30.291 --> 02:31.875
Protesters?

02:31.917 --> 02:33.709
The things
they were yelling,

02:33.750 --> 02:36.208
calling me a murderer,
a baby killer.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.709
I couldn't go in.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.041
I tried to find
a private doctor,

02:39.083 --> 02:40.959
but most of them
won't do abortions.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.959
I'm lucky my girlfriend
knew a doctor who would.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.792
Yeah. Well, it's hard
to do your job

02:45.834 --> 02:47.041
when you're getting
death threats.

02:47.083 --> 02:50.041
Some doctors aren't even trained
in the procedure anymore.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.792
I want kids. I do.
Just not now.

02:52.834 --> 02:56.834
I mean, babies are expensive,
kids need time and attention.

02:56.875 --> 02:58.583
It seemed wrong to bring one
into the world

02:58.625 --> 03:00.041
I couldn't do right by.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.000
Patty, you don't have to justify
your decision to me.

03:04.583 --> 03:07.959
The doctor told me I might have
some cramping and tenderness,

03:08.041 --> 03:10.458
but I didn't expect
to feel this bad.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.000
Okay. Let's take a look.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.000
What is it?
Is something wrong?

03:21.417 --> 03:23.166
Patty, I'm sorry. Uh...

03:24.792 --> 03:27.000
You're still pregnant.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.000
( dramatic theme playing )

03:39.500 --> 03:43.792
The fetus looks to be
about 19 weeks.

03:43.834 --> 03:47.375
But this-- I can't--
I can't be pregnant.

03:47.417 --> 03:50.250
Charlie and I, we used a condom.
I had an abortion.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.041
Sometimes when an abortion
is done early,

03:52.083 --> 03:53.458
the pregnancy is so small

03:53.500 --> 03:55.667
that the doctor
can miss the embryonic tissue

03:55.709 --> 03:57.041
when removing it
from the uterus.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.667
But I got drunk
last weekend.

03:58.709 --> 04:00.583
I smoked two packs
of cigarettes.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.041
You have to do
something.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.041
You can just do it again,
right?

04:04.083 --> 04:09.875
Patty, you need to understand
that this isn't just tissue.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.792
You're carrying
a fetus now,

04:11.834 --> 04:15.041
and the procedure
is much more difficult.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.333
What would you have
to do to me?

04:17.583 --> 04:19.750
There's something
called laminaria,

04:19.792 --> 04:22.041
seaweed sticks
that absorb fluid and swell.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.917
They would be inserted into
your cervix to help it dilate.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.041
Twenty-four hours later
you would be brought back in,

04:27.083 --> 04:31.041
put under general anesthesia,
and the fetus would be removed

04:31.083 --> 04:34.041
using forceps and suction.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.041
Could the baby survive?
No, not at 19 weeks.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.625
The baby needs to be
at least 24 weeks

04:38.667 --> 04:40.917
to survive
outside the uterus.

04:40.959 --> 04:43.709
The fetus would die
during the procedure.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.041
I think I'm gonna be sick.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.709
Look, um,
there are other options.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.000
You can carry the baby
to term.

04:49.041 --> 04:51.792
Don't you think I considered
all the options last time?

04:51.834 --> 04:53.000
I can't carry a child,

04:53.041 --> 04:57.291
I'm on my feet eight hours
a day, I have no money.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.917
God, I'm pregnant.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.959
Look, I, uh--

05:02.000 --> 05:03.917
I know that this is a shock,

05:03.959 --> 05:05.875
so why don't you take some time,

05:05.917 --> 05:08.000
think about
what you wanna do?

05:12.083 --> 05:14.250
Okay, say hello
to a married man.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.041
SAM &amp; NAOMI:
Hey.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.041
If two people get married and
you don't actually witness it,

05:19.083 --> 05:20.041
did it really happen?

05:20.083 --> 05:21.125
( all laugh )

05:21.166 --> 05:24.041
Sorry about that.
Mm-hm. Well, congratulations.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.125
Thank you.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.417
Any word from
the medical board?

05:27.458 --> 05:29.041
Well, I still have my license,

05:29.083 --> 05:30.375
so I have every right
to be here.

05:32.083 --> 05:36.000
Wait, that's--
That's not what I meant. I--

05:36.041 --> 05:38.000
ADDISON:
Sometimes I hate being a doctor.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.959
My new patient,
she's 19 weeks pregnant,

05:40.000 --> 05:41.500
and she may want
an abortion.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.041
A partial-birth abortion?

05:43.083 --> 05:45.709
Partial-birth is not
a medical term. It's political.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.166
Okay, late-term abortion,
second-trimester, D&amp;E.

05:48.208 --> 05:50.041
Who cares what you call it?
You can't do it.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.041
Yes, she can.
It's at the doctor's discretion

05:52.083 --> 05:53.959
and it is legal.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.333
Did you even counsel her
on her options?

05:56.375 --> 05:58.583
She was counseled
before her first abortion.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.583
Her first abortion? Is she using
the procedure as birth control?

06:01.625 --> 06:03.375
No, she used condoms.
Why are you judging?

06:03.417 --> 06:06.959
There is no judgment from us,
we are doctors.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.041
And we all know that
birth control sometimes fails.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.041
I didn't wanna tell her
because it would freak her out:

06:11.083 --> 06:13.041
The doctor she went
to the first time was a quack,

06:13.083 --> 06:14.333
who didn't know
what he was doing,

06:14.375 --> 06:17.583
and now she's come to me,
and my job is to help her.

06:17.625 --> 06:18.834
How did you leave it?

06:18.875 --> 06:20.750
She's gonna think
and make her choice.

06:20.792 --> 06:21.959
Maybe the choice
has been made.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.166
What does that mean?

06:23.208 --> 06:25.041
I mean, condoms
are usually effective,

06:25.083 --> 06:28.125
and failed abortions
are negligible.

06:28.166 --> 06:31.041
So maybe this baby
was meant to live.

06:31.083 --> 06:34.041
SHELDON:
You wanna force a woman
to give birth and raise a child

06:34.083 --> 06:36.166
that she clearly doesn't want?
After what she did,

06:36.208 --> 06:38.041
Patty should give the baby up
for adoption.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.041
What she did was exercise
her right to choose.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.208
( cell phone rings )

06:42.250 --> 06:44.709
Hey. Hey, Pete.
COOPER: So if she comes back,

06:44.750 --> 06:46.625
what are you gonna do?
I have no idea.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.709
VIOLET:
Oh, my God.

06:49.959 --> 06:53.041
It's Betsey. She's in the E.R.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.625
My head hurts.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.041
I know, baby.
That was a big fall.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.709
I was in the kitchen cooking.
I just--

07:01.750 --> 07:04.041
I should've been watching her.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.709
You have to fix her.
I will, Marshall. I promise.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.041
I don't like it here.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.041
Oh, baby, no one likes
hospitals,

07:10.083 --> 07:11.458
but the doctors
are gonna make you better.

07:11.500 --> 07:16.750
No. My mommy and daddy died
here. Everybody dies here.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.250
COOPER: Is she all right?
Her vitals are stable.

07:20.291 --> 07:22.417
Any loss of consciousness
or focal neuro signs?

07:22.458 --> 07:24.041
Exam was negative.
ADDISON: C. spine?

07:24.083 --> 07:26.041
Clear. We're waiting on CT
and portable chest.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.208
I thought Social Services

07:27.250 --> 07:29.041
placed her with a family
in Riverside.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.458
Yeah. What is she--? What is
she doing in St. Ambrose?

07:31.500 --> 07:35.250
Her family moved to the Westside
a few months ago.

07:35.291 --> 07:36.417
She's been right here?

07:38.542 --> 07:42.917
CT shows an extensive contusion
in the left temporal region.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.000
Does that mean surgery?

07:44.041 --> 07:45.125
The swelling could
go down.

07:45.166 --> 07:47.333
We'll need to monitor her
for the next few days.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.291
ADDISON:
Any other injuries
or signs of trauma?

07:49.333 --> 07:51.583
No, the x-ray looks good.
No broken bones.

07:51.625 --> 07:54.542
Just a healed clavicle fracture,
looks a couple months old.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.041
Betsey broke her collarbone
two months ago

07:56.083 --> 07:57.917
and now she falls
down the stairs?

07:57.959 --> 07:59.500
Now, we shouldn't jump
to any conclusions.

07:59.542 --> 08:01.041
I do this every day, Sheldon,

08:01.083 --> 08:03.000
and to me
that sounds like abuse.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.166
ADDISON:
Cooper, you cannot jump
to abuse.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.375
We should have Social Services
make an assessment.

08:14.417 --> 08:15.709
What do you think
we should do?

08:15.750 --> 08:16.917
We can't leave her.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.000
If you guys had
just taken her

08:18.041 --> 08:19.542
when she got left
in the office--

08:19.583 --> 08:21.000
This wouldn't have happened?

08:21.041 --> 08:22.291
Oh, it's not like you took her.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.709
Guys, this
isn't helping.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.542
Okay, Pete. You met the parents.
What did you think?

08:26.583 --> 08:28.583
They were
loving and concerned.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.709
And Betsey is clearly
very attached.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.291
To Betsey,
any parents are good.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.625
NAOMI: If they're abusing--
We have to get her out.

08:34.667 --> 08:37.000
I broke four bones
by the time I was 10.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.709
Kids fall all the time.
PETE: Okay, look.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.709
It seems like Betsey's
found a good family.

08:40.750 --> 08:44.041
We cannot risk ruining that
unless we have concrete proof.

08:44.083 --> 08:46.000
Let's get some.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.667
( knocking )

08:49.709 --> 08:51.000
Cooper.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.000
Hi, I'm Dr. Cooper Freedman.
GINA: Hi.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.792
COOPER:
And this is Dr. Violet Turner.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.041
We used to work
with Betsey's dad.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.667
Oh.
Naomi.

08:57.709 --> 08:59.000
Hey, sweetie.

08:59.041 --> 09:00.792
Phil and Gina Rakoff.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.041
Behind the video game,
that's our son, Marshall.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.041
Hi, I'm Dr. Naomi Bennett.

09:05.083 --> 09:08.583
Betsey, look how popular
you are. All these visitors.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.542
Uh, why don't we step over here

09:10.583 --> 09:12.041
so I can update you on
what's going on?

09:15.083 --> 09:16.875
I'm so glad to see you.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.959
Why didn't you visit me?

09:21.625 --> 09:24.083
I wanted to, I did. But--

09:24.125 --> 09:26.000
I don't wanna talk to you.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.542
Look, it's okay.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.709
Hey, sweetie.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.458
So how do you like
your new family?

09:40.083 --> 09:43.000
That fall must have been scary,
huh?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.333
You did fall, right, sweetie?

09:50.667 --> 09:53.166
Sweetie, did somebody hurt you?

09:54.875 --> 09:56.583
How about when you--?
When you broke the bone?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.458
I--

10:00.500 --> 10:03.083
I fell off the jungle gym.

10:03.125 --> 10:05.208
Betsey, listen,

10:05.250 --> 10:09.041
even if somebody told you not
to, you can tell me, okay?

10:09.083 --> 10:10.667
I love you.
We all love you here.

10:10.709 --> 10:13.041
But you sent me away.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.834
GINA:
What's the matter, honey?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.208
PHIL:
What's going on?
Why's she upset?

10:16.250 --> 10:19.041
Um, to be perfectly honest,
I'm concerned about this fall

10:19.083 --> 10:20.333
that seems to have come
on the heels

10:20.375 --> 10:22.667
of the other accident
where she broke the clavicle.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.291
Kids fall.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.125
They do, but two severe ones,
so close together, it's...

10:28.208 --> 10:30.041
Are you accusing us
of hurting her?

10:30.083 --> 10:31.542
PHIL:
We love Betsey.

10:31.583 --> 10:34.041
You have no right--
Don't be mean to my mommy.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.041
You're upsetting our children
and you're both way out of line.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.959
Get the hell out
and don't come back.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.709
Poor kid, huh?

10:51.750 --> 10:54.375
Yeah, I suppose
we made our bed.

10:54.417 --> 10:56.041
What, you think
this is our fault?

10:56.083 --> 10:59.625
I think that we--
All of us at the practice.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.959
We make decisions

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
and we don't think
about the consequences.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.041
All I can think about lately
are consequences.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.917
This Patty thing's really
killing you.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.041
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.291
You wanna have a baby.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.917
You want a baby so bad
that we broke up and now--

11:15.959 --> 11:19.625
In a few weeks,
that fetus could be a baby.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.834
Not just a collection of cells,
but a baby and...

11:23.959 --> 11:25.000
Sorry.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.875
Thank you.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.875
I should go.
Mm-hm.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.041
When I offered
to take you to lunch,

11:44.083 --> 11:45.041
the hospital cafeteria

11:45.083 --> 11:47.041
wasn't exactly what
I had in mind.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.041
Yes, well, I need to be here
right now,

11:49.083 --> 11:50.125
and I only have
a half an hour.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.041
I gotta pick up Olivia.

11:52.083 --> 11:55.250
Don't get me wrong. I'm happy
to see you as much as possible.

11:55.291 --> 11:59.709
Don't. Do not ask me
about D.C. again, okay? Not now.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.125
Betsey's in ICU,

12:02.166 --> 12:06.375
Addison may be performing
an abortion on a woman

12:06.417 --> 12:08.041
who is 19 weeks pregnant.

12:08.083 --> 12:11.125
Hmm. Late-term by definition,
but certainly not illegal.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.583
I mean, I can see how
that might frustrate

12:14.625 --> 12:16.041
someone whose work
is creating life.

12:16.083 --> 12:19.458
That's a careful response.
You don't agree with me?

12:19.500 --> 12:20.834
A fetus may be a life,

12:20.875 --> 12:22.917
but it's not
a biologically independent life.

12:22.959 --> 12:26.041
So in my mind, and in the mind
of the Supreme Court,

12:26.083 --> 12:28.041
the right of termination
belongs to the mother.

12:28.083 --> 12:31.041
Well, thank you
for the civics lesson.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.000
Maybe you should offer
to assist Addison.

12:34.041 --> 12:36.041
If I felt that strongly
about it, I would.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.834
You know me.
I'm all about going after

12:38.875 --> 12:40.333
what you believe in
as hard as possible.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.917
( mysterious theme playing )

12:48.000 --> 12:50.041
She hates me.
Betsey does not hate you.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.083
Of course she hates me.
I'm the one who sent her away.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.667
I'm the one
who looked that little girl

12:53.709 --> 12:56.333
in the eye
and sold her a fairy tale

12:56.375 --> 12:58.458
about how marvelous
her new life was gonna be,

12:58.500 --> 13:00.041
because I couldn't tell
her the truth.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.041
Now her foster parents
could be hurting her.

13:02.083 --> 13:04.917
For all we know, she did fall.
But we don't know, do we?

13:04.959 --> 13:07.542
It's just too much.
First Betsey loses her parents,

13:07.583 --> 13:10.041
and then her aunt drops
her off here

13:10.083 --> 13:12.709
like a package that was tossed
into the trash by us,

13:12.750 --> 13:15.959
the people who were supposed
to care. And now tack on abuse?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.041
I-- I had an obligation to
take care of Dell's little girl.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.166
Look, you've gotta stop
beating yourself up.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.000
Or is it me
that you blame for all this?

13:27.083 --> 13:29.041
Well, right now,
I'm the one being blamed.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.959
By Betsey. And that's all
I can think about.

13:34.542 --> 13:35.583
Can I go home soon?

13:35.625 --> 13:37.041
We're working
on it, honey.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.166
( knocking on doorframe )

13:38.208 --> 13:40.041
I told you to stay away
from my family.

13:40.083 --> 13:43.375
I'm not coming in.
She is.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.750
Gladys?
Hi, Betsey. Remember me?

13:45.792 --> 13:47.291
Our little girl
has a brain injury

13:47.333 --> 13:49.125
and you called
Social Services?

13:50.458 --> 13:52.417
Outside. Right now.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.041
AMELIA:
What are you doing?
She needs to stay calm.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.041
For the next few days, our
main focus has to be her health.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.291
I am worried about her health.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.333
Dr. Freedman, I will follow up,
I promise.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.375
But I think you're wrong
about Phil and Gina.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.500
( popping )

14:08.542 --> 14:10.959
( Naomi &amp; Sheldon laughing )

14:11.000 --> 14:12.583
It is oddly therapeutic,
you know.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.041
Please, you are preaching
to the choir.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.834
My goodness.
I can't get enough.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.750
Oh, but Maya's gonna be back
soon enough,

14:19.792 --> 14:21.041
so I have to enjoy it
while I can.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.667
Okay, I'll see you.
Bye.

14:22.709 --> 14:24.000
( popping )

14:24.041 --> 14:25.667
Bye.
NAOMI: Bye-bye.

14:27.083 --> 14:30.041
Is Dr. Montgomery in?
She's at the hospital.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.041
She should be back soon.

14:32.083 --> 14:35.041
Can you tell her
that Patty stopped by?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.959
Uh, Patty?

14:37.000 --> 14:40.041
Hi. I'm--
I'm Dr. Naomi Bennett.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.542
Would you like to wait
in my office?

14:42.583 --> 14:45.959
I have some tissues. Okay.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.166
I had a plan. I was gonna
finish grad school, get my MBA,

14:50.208 --> 14:53.041
meet a great guy
who thinks I hung the moon,

14:53.083 --> 14:56.667
get married, and around
35 we'd have a baby.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.041
Well, no one is ready,
ever ready, to have a baby.

14:59.083 --> 15:02.041
It's just--
You just do it.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.041
You know, my daughter
was 16 years old

15:04.083 --> 15:06.375
when she got pregnant
with Olivia here.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.041
She hadn't even finished
high school.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.166
And I almost...

15:10.208 --> 15:14.792
No, I-- I tried to force her
to have an abortion,

15:14.834 --> 15:17.041
and I'm so grateful every single
day that she didn't.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.041
But she had you to help her.
My boyfriend, Charlie,

15:20.083 --> 15:22.834
he couldn't get away fast enough
when I told him I was pregnant.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.041
That just means he's not ready
to be a father.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.125
I can't be a mother.
I have nothing.

15:27.166 --> 15:28.875
I have to work all the time.

15:28.917 --> 15:31.041
But being a mother isn't
about what you have,

15:31.083 --> 15:31.959
it's about who you are.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.959
I can't have this baby.
I can't.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.458
I already got
an abortion before,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.041
I can live through it
again.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.500
It's not the same, Patty.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.959
At 19 weeks, do you know
that your child can hear you?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.709
It can be startled
by loud noises.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.542
Your child already
has vocal cords

15:46.583 --> 15:51.458
and fingerprints and air sacs
in her lungs.

15:51.500 --> 15:55.709
She can move her arms and legs,
not unlike Olivia here.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.500
Yeah. Yeah.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.041
I know you're confused,

16:00.083 --> 16:01.166
which is why
I think you need

16:01.208 --> 16:03.000
a little more time
to think about it.

16:03.041 --> 16:04.917
And I promise you
that I can offer you

16:04.959 --> 16:06.166
all the support you need

16:06.208 --> 16:10.917
to get through this pregnancy.
Just please, just consider...

16:12.083 --> 16:16.500
Just consider
carrying the baby to term.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.709
What did you say to Patty?

16:28.750 --> 16:29.875
She comes here to see me

16:29.917 --> 16:32.041
and then you scare her
into changing her mind?

16:32.083 --> 16:33.500
I didn't scare her.
I talked to her.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.000
You had no right.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.375
She needed to think.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.959
This abortion could affect
her for the rest of her life.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.291
Any choice would affect her for
the rest of her life.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.583
All the more reason
to be sure of her decision.

16:43.625 --> 16:45.792
You don't get an opinion,
you don't work here.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.500
Which makes me
the objective person.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.125
The patient was made aware
of her options

16:49.166 --> 16:51.166
and she chose.
End of story.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.041
SHELDON:
This isn't some clinical trial

16:53.083 --> 16:54.750
where we line up
the pros and cons.

16:54.792 --> 16:57.709
There's an emotional component
here that can't be quantified.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.000
It's not just emotional,
this is physical.

17:00.041 --> 17:02.500
When you crush that baby's skull
to get it through the cervix,

17:02.542 --> 17:04.041
it feels that pain.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.041
You don't think I know that?

17:05.083 --> 17:06.041
I don't think you care.

17:06.083 --> 17:09.041
Of course I care.
But Patty is my patient.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.208
You violated the trust

17:10.250 --> 17:11.959
that I established
with my patient.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.041
My patient. You have crossed
so far over the line,

17:15.083 --> 17:16.250
you can't even see it.

17:16.291 --> 17:17.667
I did what I thought was right.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.166
Whether or not to do
this procedure

17:19.208 --> 17:21.041
is not your decision,
it is mine.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.542
I thought it was Patty's.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.875
You didn't wanna do it anyway.
And now you don't have to.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.041
Don't pretend you did this
for me.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.041
You manipulated a terrified
and confused girl.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.208
Preach whatever you want
to your own patients,

17:31.250 --> 17:33.041
but stay away from mine.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.166
How's Betsey doing?

17:40.208 --> 17:42.041
Her intracranial pressure
is holding steady,

17:42.083 --> 17:43.041
so no surgery yet.

17:43.083 --> 17:46.041
Honestly, for once
I don't wanna cut.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.625
I get that.
It's a tricky procedure.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.458
Besides, Betsey is just a kid.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.208
And her father died on my table.

17:54.083 --> 17:57.083
What happened with Dell
was not your fault.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.000
You don't really
blame yourself, do you?

18:01.083 --> 18:03.041
I don't know. I just--

18:03.083 --> 18:04.583
I've got a little girl
in the ICU

18:04.625 --> 18:07.041
and all I can think about,

18:07.083 --> 18:09.917
all I can focus on,
is how badly I want a drink.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.500
My mama always says,

18:12.542 --> 18:14.041
"God doesn't give
with both hands."

18:14.083 --> 18:17.083
You're young, beautiful,
brilliant.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.000
Has to be something
you can't have.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.500
Some days I'd give all that up.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.083
That's just the craving talking.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.041
But the longer you go
without a drink--

18:25.083 --> 18:29.500
I drank at your wedding.
I thought it was ginger ale.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.041
I spit it out.
Okay.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.041
Since then?
Nothing.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.959
But I can't stop thinking
about it.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.750
It was an accident.

18:39.792 --> 18:41.125
Don't turn a slip
into a fall.

18:43.375 --> 18:44.709
Get your butt to a meeting.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.041
I will.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.000
I gotta go watch Betsey
a little longer.

18:56.959 --> 18:59.333
Hey. Are you okay?
No.

18:59.375 --> 19:03.041
You know, Betsey's just a kid,
she's suffered a trauma,

19:03.083 --> 19:04.375
so give her some time.

19:04.417 --> 19:05.667
Time won't change the fact

19:05.709 --> 19:08.000
that Pete
didn't let me keep her.

19:08.041 --> 19:10.083
Look, I'm all for blaming Pete
when it's justified,

19:10.125 --> 19:11.875
but this is not his fault.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.291
If you wanted to adopt Betsey,
you could have fought harder.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.041
You've been married
for a minute and a half,

19:16.083 --> 19:17.125
what do you know?

19:17.166 --> 19:19.041
Okay, do you want a shoulder
or the truth?

19:19.083 --> 19:22.000
Spit it out.
Okay.

19:22.041 --> 19:24.041
After Betsey left,
you didn't visit her.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.417
None of us did.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.291
But you judged us
for not coming to her rescue.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.000
You played the guilt card,
the responsibility card.

19:30.041 --> 19:32.041
You made her your mission.

19:32.083 --> 19:35.750
And then the social worker
takes her away and,

19:35.792 --> 19:37.834
you know, out of sight,
out of mind.

19:39.583 --> 19:44.041
Oh, God. I'm vile. I'm selfish.
I am selfish and vile.

19:44.083 --> 19:47.000
Come on, Violet.
We all failed Betsey.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.250
We just have to figure out
how to help her now.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.792
You have to know that
we didn't-- We could never--

19:55.834 --> 19:57.959
Where do they get off
accusing us of hurting her?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.792
Look, we all just want
what's best for her.

20:01.166 --> 20:04.875
I should probably take
Marshall home.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.041
You're leaving?

20:06.083 --> 20:08.583
I'm staying with you,
honey, okay?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.000
Hug your sister, hmm?

20:14.041 --> 20:15.208
( EKG beeping )

20:15.250 --> 20:17.583
I need some help in here.
PHIL: What's happening?

20:17.625 --> 20:19.041
PETE:
Ten milligrams of lorazepam.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.750
She was fine.
I don't understand.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.959
AMELIA: What's going on?
ICP is off the chart.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.375
We need to get her
into surgery now.

20:24.417 --> 20:25.500
PETE:
Come on.

20:27.041 --> 20:29.208
I'm going with her.
I should go too, but Marshall.

20:29.250 --> 20:32.625
You both go, I'll stay with him.
Thank you.

20:36.041 --> 20:39.041
Will Betsey be okay?
Dr. Shepherd is the best.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.375
She'll do everything she can.
You have to make her okay.

20:41.417 --> 20:43.250
You have to. You promised.

20:43.291 --> 20:46.041
Make her okay!
Make Betsey better!

20:46.083 --> 20:49.500
Make her better! You promised!
You said you will!

20:49.542 --> 20:51.000
Make her better!

20:58.125 --> 20:59.834
SHELDON: Hey, Pete.
Hey.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.041
Who's your
friend?

21:01.083 --> 21:04.041
This is Marshall,
Betsey's foster brother.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.291
Mommy says we don't
say "foster."

21:05.333 --> 21:07.041
SHELDON:
Of course. I'm Sheldon.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.000
Hey, can I join you?
PETE: Sure.

21:13.166 --> 21:15.250
SHELDON:
You and Betsey
are about the same age.

21:15.291 --> 21:17.125
Must be nice to have her
living with you.

21:17.166 --> 21:20.000
Yeah. It's fun.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.834
Uh, hey, listen.
I gotta check on a patient.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.333
Do you mind? I'll be back
in a couple of minutes.

21:30.583 --> 21:34.083
Now, I'm sure you got upset
by what happened to Betsey,

21:34.125 --> 21:37.041
but the doctors here
are very good.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.291
They're gonna take
great care of her.

21:44.125 --> 21:47.166
Does your dad ever get upset?
Sometimes.

21:49.375 --> 21:53.041
But does he get more upset
now that Betsey lives with you?

21:53.083 --> 21:55.000
He fights with Mommy a lot more.

21:56.375 --> 21:59.166
And Mommy gets sad.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.750
I don't like it.
Of course not.

22:01.792 --> 22:02.792
You love your mom.

22:03.917 --> 22:05.917
So, what do you do
to make her happy?

22:05.959 --> 22:08.792
I'm an extra good boy
so she knows I love her.

22:08.834 --> 22:11.083
I tell Betsey to be
extra good too,

22:11.125 --> 22:12.625
and to listen
to Daddy and Mommy.

22:12.667 --> 22:15.041
And when Betsey
doesn't listen,

22:15.083 --> 22:17.041
does your dad do more
than just talk to her?

22:17.083 --> 22:19.750
Does he spank her or...?

22:19.792 --> 22:22.625
No.
SHELDON: What about your mom?

22:22.667 --> 22:26.333
Is she ever mean to Betsey?
No.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.750
But sometimes I help her
to listen.

22:37.542 --> 22:38.834
How do you do that?

22:41.041 --> 22:43.000
Is that what you did
on the jungle gym?

22:44.083 --> 22:45.667
Betsey's clumsy.

22:46.792 --> 22:47.792
It was her fault.

22:49.458 --> 22:53.041
And when Betsey misbehaves,
I guess that's her fault too.

22:53.083 --> 22:54.709
Must make it harder
for your parents.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.041
Yeah.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.208
And that's not right.

23:01.083 --> 23:04.583
So I guess it makes sense, then,
that she needs to be punished.

23:11.083 --> 23:15.000
I'm done with my ice cream.
Can I have more?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.750
( tense theme playing )

23:24.959 --> 23:27.208
CHARLOTTE: How's it going?
AMELIA: It's tricky.

23:27.250 --> 23:29.500
The hematoma's on the tip
of the left temporal lobe.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.041
If I remove
more than four centimeters,

23:31.083 --> 23:33.625
she'll have persistent
speech problems.

23:35.917 --> 23:37.041
You checking up on me?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.834
Worried I'm not competent
to do this?

23:38.875 --> 23:40.834
Actually, I have complete
faith in you.

23:40.875 --> 23:43.417
I'm just worried you lost faith
in yourself.

23:43.458 --> 23:45.917
AMELIA:
Sooner or later
this kid's gotta catch a break.

23:45.959 --> 23:48.750
Dell did everything for Betsey
and it still all went bad.

23:48.792 --> 23:51.041
Why do you think having kids
scares the crap out of me?

23:51.083 --> 23:53.834
Cooper must want them.
CHARLOTTE: Of course.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.291
He's giving me the time
to get onboard.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.041
That's nice.

23:57.083 --> 23:59.750
Addison had to choose between
having a kid and being with Sam.

23:59.792 --> 24:02.041
Now she's got neither.

24:02.083 --> 24:05.000
You're lucky to have a man
like Coop.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.000
Got it.

24:10.959 --> 24:12.041
( EKG beeping )

24:12.083 --> 24:14.041
What's wrong?
Damn, there's a bleed.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.333
I need to remove more
of the temporal lobe to stop it.

24:16.375 --> 24:17.875
If I am off
by one centimeter--

24:17.917 --> 24:19.041
Amelia, this is
what you do.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.667
Don't think,
just do it.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.000
I knew Betsey
was holding back.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.792
Marshall didn't admit
to pushing her.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.959
He didn't have to.
The way he talked about Betsey

24:31.000 --> 24:32.166
and his aggressiveness
with Pete.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.000
Marshall's been hurting Betsey.

24:34.041 --> 24:36.750
I can't believe it.
The kid's only eight years old.

24:36.792 --> 24:39.041
Well, did Marshall feel
any guilt at all?

24:39.083 --> 24:40.041
He justifies his actions

24:40.083 --> 24:41.959
under the guise
of protecting his mother.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.959
And there's a pride
he associates

24:44.000 --> 24:45.083
with being a good boy.

24:45.125 --> 24:47.083
So the kid's a psychopath.
No, no one is saying that.

24:47.125 --> 24:49.041
There's a reason why
we don't diagnose kids

24:49.083 --> 24:51.041
with antisocial
personality disorder.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.041
The prefrontal cortex
doesn't really develop

24:53.083 --> 24:54.583
till we're in our 20s.
I know that.

24:54.625 --> 24:56.041
VIOLET:
While the brain is maturing,

24:56.083 --> 24:57.750
he could be learning ways
to hurt people.

24:57.792 --> 24:59.041
Therapy?
Possibly.

24:59.083 --> 25:01.500
Maybe he needs more love
and attention.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.166
VIOLET:
Why are we worrying
about Marshall?

25:03.208 --> 25:04.750
Betsey's the one
we care about.

25:04.792 --> 25:06.166
Recent history
notwithstanding.

25:06.208 --> 25:09.083
We didn't give up on Betsey.
Okay? You weren't here.

25:09.125 --> 25:12.333
It was difficult and complicated
and you weren't here.

25:22.083 --> 25:24.208
You need to keep Marshall
away from Betsey.

25:24.250 --> 25:27.041
What are you talking about?
Marshall loves his sister.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.166
You're not involved in this.
Yes, I am.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.625
I'm the one who promised Betsey

25:30.667 --> 25:32.834
she would be safe
in foster care.
She is.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.542
There's something wrong
with Marshall.

25:34.583 --> 25:35.625
Who are you?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.041
Sheldon Wallace.
I'm a psychiatrist.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.333
Of course you are.

25:38.375 --> 25:40.542
Betsey's intracranial
pressure spiked

25:40.583 --> 25:42.250
when Marshall
was about to hug her.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.542
She's clearly afraid of him.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.041
You've never even talked
to Marshall.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.542
I spent time with him
earlier.

25:46.583 --> 25:49.041
And I really do believe
that he's trying to hurt her.

25:49.083 --> 25:52.041
Wait. You interrogated
our son?

25:52.083 --> 25:54.250
He was trying to protect
your daughter.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.041
PHIL:
What kind of doctors are you?

25:56.083 --> 25:59.000
We've heard enough. Get out
of here or I'll call security.

26:00.333 --> 26:03.083
How is she? How's Betsey?
She's out of surgery.

26:03.125 --> 26:06.917
She's stable,
but she's in a coma.

26:18.917 --> 26:20.667
I've been calling you all day.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.917
I know.

26:23.959 --> 26:25.041
I just needed some time.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.834
I just wanted to apologize
for Dr. Bennett.

26:27.875 --> 26:30.458
She had no right
to upset you like that.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.750
Believe me, I--

26:34.792 --> 26:36.250
I just wanna make sure
that you're okay

26:36.291 --> 26:38.417
and tell you
that I am here to talk,

26:38.458 --> 26:41.000
to listen, to help you
in any way I can.

26:51.125 --> 26:53.000
PATTY:
Dr. Montgomery?

26:55.542 --> 26:57.000
I don't know what to do.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.083
I can't tell you what to do.

27:03.125 --> 27:05.125
I can only tell you
that it's your choice.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.041
Maybe it shouldn't be.

27:08.083 --> 27:10.083
But it has to be.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.041
Patty,
when it comes to abortion,

27:13.083 --> 27:15.041
everybody has an opinion.

27:15.083 --> 27:17.000
Everybody's gonna wanna
tell you what to do.

27:17.041 --> 27:19.875
If this were 1972,
it would have been a back alley

27:19.917 --> 27:21.959
and not my elevator
that you would've collapsed in,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.250
because back then,
you didn't have a choice.

27:24.291 --> 27:26.458
Now you do.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.125
But it's still hard.

27:28.166 --> 27:29.333
And even after you make

27:29.375 --> 27:32.250
the most difficult
and personal decision

27:32.291 --> 27:33.667
that there is,

27:33.709 --> 27:37.000
it's still not safe,
because you have some fanatic

27:37.041 --> 27:38.333
who claims to value life,

27:38.375 --> 27:40.583
who can walk into an
abortion clinic and blow it up.

27:40.625 --> 27:44.041
Patty, you
are the only one who knows

27:44.083 --> 27:45.500
if you're ready
to have a child.

27:45.542 --> 27:48.041
Everybody else's opinion
is just background noise.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.834
So if you wanna keep this baby,
I'll support you.

27:50.875 --> 27:53.208
You wanna give it up
for adoption, I'll help.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.417
You want an abortion,
I'll do it.

27:55.458 --> 27:57.166
I am not here
to judge you.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.333
I just need you to know

27:58.375 --> 28:01.458
that whatever
decision you make is for you.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.709
Not for me,
not for Dr. Bennett.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.000
For you.

28:16.083 --> 28:19.458
Hey. Any word on Betsey?

28:19.500 --> 28:20.792
( sighs )

28:20.834 --> 28:23.000
She still hasn't woken up.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.625
I know I wasn't here

28:28.667 --> 28:30.000
when Betsey's aunt
dropped her off

28:30.041 --> 28:31.959
and maybe I should've
come back from Africa--

28:32.000 --> 28:34.417
We have Olivia to take care of

28:34.458 --> 28:36.667
and we're nowhere near
done with Maya.

28:36.709 --> 28:40.041
Well, as much as she'd like
to think otherwise.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.625
I don't know.
Do you think that she'd be okay

28:42.667 --> 28:44.542
if we didn't see her that often?

28:44.583 --> 28:46.000
Well, she might not
go to Columbia.

28:46.041 --> 28:47.041
Yeah.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.834
On the other hand,

28:48.875 --> 28:52.000
New York is just a short
train ride away from D.C.

28:53.208 --> 28:54.375
Hmm?

28:54.417 --> 28:56.000
Fife asked me to go back
with him. Heh.

28:59.083 --> 29:01.000
( clears throat )

29:01.041 --> 29:03.000
And are you considering it?

29:03.041 --> 29:06.458
I know. You don't like him.
He is an arrogant ass.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.709
( chuckles )

29:07.750 --> 29:10.166
I mean, I wouldn't pick him
for you.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.542
But what do I know?

29:13.625 --> 29:15.875
How are you doing
since you and Addison split?

29:18.083 --> 29:19.291
I have my good days,
bad days.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.709
You think you two will manage
to stay friends?

29:24.083 --> 29:25.000
You think you will?

29:36.500 --> 29:38.709
You're a good mother, Gina.

29:38.750 --> 29:39.959
You love Marshall.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
You spend time with him,
you take care of him.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.333
You knew, didn't you?

29:49.500 --> 29:51.000
He...

29:52.083 --> 29:53.875
He doesn't have friends.

29:58.083 --> 30:00.000
Fights with kids at school.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.041
He says they pick on him,
but the other parents,

30:04.083 --> 30:06.166
the guidance counselors,

30:06.208 --> 30:09.959
they always swear
Marshall started it.

30:12.166 --> 30:15.375
I knew he was different,

30:15.417 --> 30:18.250
but you don't wanna think--

30:18.291 --> 30:21.125
I just-- I--
I didn't wanna see it.

30:21.166 --> 30:25.709
I thought if we brought
another kid into our home,

30:25.750 --> 30:27.625
he'd have someone.

30:28.750 --> 30:29.750
A friend.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.125
That's not enough.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.917
He needs--
GINA: More.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.542
Love, attention.

30:38.583 --> 30:39.834
More of us.

30:46.750 --> 30:49.000
I love you, Betsey.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.667
Wait.

31:03.709 --> 31:05.667
Betsey can't go back
in the system.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.917
Marshall is my son.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.583
He has to come first.

31:12.625 --> 31:15.166
( dramatic theme playing )

31:35.417 --> 31:37.834
My kid would've been
six this year.

31:39.083 --> 31:40.041
A girl.

31:40.083 --> 31:42.000
I know it would've
been a girl.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.250
Ella.

31:47.709 --> 31:49.500
She would've been
in the first grade.

31:51.333 --> 31:54.041
She would've had the same gap
between her teeth as me.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.166
If you have this much regret
about your own abortion,

31:56.208 --> 31:58.125
then how can you go through
with this?

31:59.875 --> 32:04.000
I know that that may have been
my one chance to get pregnant.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.208
But still...

32:07.250 --> 32:09.333
For me it was

32:11.375 --> 32:14.041
the right decision
at the time.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.959
I do not take this lightly,
Nai.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.917
To try to separate
what I want personally

32:17.959 --> 32:20.750
from what I need to do
professionally

32:20.792 --> 32:24.083
is killing me.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.583
( sighs )

32:26.583 --> 32:27.959
I wanna strangle
the doctor

32:28.000 --> 32:29.959
who botched this up
in the first place.

32:30.959 --> 32:32.250
We've come so far,
right?

32:32.291 --> 32:34.917
Then why can't Patty
get what she needs?

32:34.959 --> 32:39.417
A safe and legal abortion
without judgment?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.500
Why does she have
to go through this again?

32:44.083 --> 32:45.792
Why do I have to go
through this?

32:49.333 --> 32:50.542
I hate what I'm about to do,

32:50.583 --> 32:54.750
but I support Patty's right
to choose.

32:54.792 --> 32:57.291
It is not enough
to just have an opinion,

32:57.333 --> 33:01.041
because in a nation
of over 300 million people,

33:01.083 --> 33:03.917
there are only
1,700 abortion providers.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.000
And I'm one of them.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.041
Okay, Patty. We're ready.

33:16.083 --> 33:17.959
Are you sure
about this?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.333
Yeah, I'm sure.

33:19.375 --> 33:21.083
This is what I want.

33:21.125 --> 33:24.208
But I'm so scared.
I know.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.041
I'm gonna take
good care of you.

33:26.083 --> 33:28.041
I just feel so alone.

33:29.834 --> 33:32.500
You're not alone, Patty.

33:32.542 --> 33:34.417
You're not alone.

33:41.417 --> 33:43.959
ADDISON:
Prep tray and Foley cath.

33:57.083 --> 33:59.000
You did everything
you could.

34:01.583 --> 34:02.750
What if it's not enough?

34:02.792 --> 34:05.041
What if the amount
of temporal lobe

34:05.083 --> 34:08.333
I removed from Betsey
damaged her brain?

34:08.375 --> 34:10.125
She could lose her ability
to speak,

34:10.166 --> 34:11.583
if she even wakes up.

34:12.709 --> 34:14.041
It's been a rough couple
of days.

34:14.083 --> 34:17.041
The hospital can reach you
if there are any changes.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.417
Why don't we go
to a meeting?

34:20.792 --> 34:23.041
I'm grateful
that we are friends

34:23.083 --> 34:24.417
and that you look out for me,
but...

34:24.458 --> 34:26.834
You can't worry that every time
something goes wrong,

34:26.875 --> 34:27.875
I'm gonna drink.

34:29.125 --> 34:30.667
I'm gonna stay here.

34:30.709 --> 34:33.834
But I will go to a meeting
with you tomorrow morning.

34:33.875 --> 34:34.875
I promise.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.542
( tender theme playing )

35:05.291 --> 35:06.500
( sighs )

35:07.583 --> 35:09.000
Thank you.

35:10.125 --> 35:13.041
I know that you were there
for Patty, but--

35:13.083 --> 35:15.000
I was there
for the both of you.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.000
You helped that woman.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.125
I miss you, Nai.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.625
I really miss you.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.041
When you took Patty's hand
in there

35:27.083 --> 35:28.291
and told her
she wasn't alone,

35:28.333 --> 35:31.041
it broke my heart.

35:31.083 --> 35:34.375
Because I am alone.

35:34.417 --> 35:38.792
Somewhere along the way,
you let go of my hand.

35:39.792 --> 35:42.000
And being alone,
it just sucks.

35:45.083 --> 35:47.083
I want
my best friend back.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.291
You wanna get a drink?

36:03.333 --> 36:06.375
Yeah, I do. I do.
Ha, ha.

36:06.417 --> 36:10.041
But, um, can I bring
some wine over later?

36:10.083 --> 36:12.375
Sure. You have plans?

36:12.417 --> 36:15.542
Um, what I have are a lot
of opinions.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.959
It's time for me
to act on them.

36:24.083 --> 36:27.041
What if she doesn't wake up?

36:27.083 --> 36:29.000
Betsey's tough.
She'll come out okay.

36:31.083 --> 36:34.959
What?
You. Ha, ha.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.959
You never struck me
as the kid-friendly type.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.834
I used to think
that anything that took me away

36:39.875 --> 36:42.000
from the lab
was a waste of time.

36:42.041 --> 36:44.041
But now, I don't know.

36:44.083 --> 36:46.625
I guess I can see
the advantages of making space

36:46.667 --> 36:48.000
in my life for others.

36:51.291 --> 36:53.000
I can't go with you.

36:57.709 --> 36:59.000
I love you, Naomi.

36:59.041 --> 37:02.333
And I'm not sorry
I came back for you.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.583
Because I do believe
you have to stand up

37:04.625 --> 37:06.375
for the things
that truly matter.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.375
But you also gotta recognize
when you've lost.

37:12.917 --> 37:15.000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

37:33.083 --> 37:35.041
She's gonna wake up,
right?

37:35.083 --> 37:37.625
CHARLOTTE:
She has to.

37:42.959 --> 37:44.667
I'm lucky to have you,
Coop.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.917
I don't ever want it to seem
like I take you for granted.

37:48.959 --> 37:51.959
We can't take anything
for granted.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.208
Hey, Betsey.

38:25.083 --> 38:27.041
It's me.

38:27.083 --> 38:29.000
It's Violet.

38:31.083 --> 38:33.709
You know, you're right
to be mad at me.

38:33.750 --> 38:37.000
Your dad would be so mad
at me too.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.083
It's sad that the only way
I can talk to you

38:41.125 --> 38:42.375
is when you can't hear me,

38:42.417 --> 38:45.000
but, I don't know,
maybe you can.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.625
Okay.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.125
I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

38:59.041 --> 39:02.166
I didn't want to,
but, uh...

39:02.208 --> 39:06.041
I was afraid that if I told you
that foster care was...

39:06.083 --> 39:07.083
I mean, if you thought that

39:07.125 --> 39:09.959
where you were going
wasn't safe

39:10.000 --> 39:11.291
and happy and full of love,

39:11.333 --> 39:14.000
then it would make it harder
for you to go.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.709
Or maybe it would just make
it harder

39:16.750 --> 39:17.750
for me to see you leave.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.041
I don't know.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.208
But...

39:24.083 --> 39:25.959
You have to know that I care.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.750
And I wanted to help.

39:27.792 --> 39:31.041
I mean, I wanna help now.
So...

39:31.083 --> 39:32.291
So. Ahem.

39:34.083 --> 39:37.208
I promise you
that I am going to find

39:37.250 --> 39:38.959
some people for you
to live with

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
who will give you all the love
that you deserve.

39:41.041 --> 39:43.041
And I'm not gonna
give up this time, okay?

39:43.083 --> 39:45.208
So you better not
give up either.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.375
Because you have--

39:49.458 --> 39:52.750
You have so much life ahead
of you and you have

39:52.792 --> 39:56.041
so many beautiful things
to look forward to.

39:57.667 --> 40:00.000
But you have to wake up.

40:08.083 --> 40:10.041
Violet?

40:10.083 --> 40:12.291
( tender pop music playing )

40:14.083 --> 40:16.000
( laughs )

40:37.083 --> 40:38.583
MAN:
What can I get you?

40:42.792 --> 40:44.000
Vodka tonic.

40:46.083 --> 40:48.041
But just one.

41:11.166 --> 41:13.291
You're still here.

41:14.291 --> 41:16.041
I promised.

41:16.083 --> 41:19.291
Thanks for calling. Hey.

41:19.333 --> 41:21.792
I heard you
were feeling better.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Where's my mommy?

41:30.333 --> 41:32.000
Oh, honey.

41:33.083 --> 41:34.792
I'm so sorry.

41:34.834 --> 41:36.667
She loves you,
she does, but--

41:36.709 --> 41:38.542
She doesn't want me anymore.

41:40.875 --> 41:45.000
Will you listen? I'm gonna
find you a family, I swear.

41:45.041 --> 41:45.959
And no matter where you are,

41:46.000 --> 41:49.041
I'm gonna be a part
of your life.

41:49.083 --> 41:50.083
Always.

41:50.125 --> 41:53.041
Where am I gonna live now?

41:53.083 --> 41:55.208
You're coming home with me.

41:57.083 --> 41:58.000
She is?

41:59.083 --> 42:00.583
For how long?

42:00.625 --> 42:03.000
How about forever?

42:04.125 --> 42:05.792
Really?

42:07.083 --> 42:08.208
Really.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.375
( mouths ):
Thank you.

42:28.417 --> 42:31.000
( mellow theme playing )
