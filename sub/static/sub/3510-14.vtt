Keep 'em comin', pal.
You're doing great.

00:29.721 --> 00:31.633
Say, maybe you can help me.
I'm lookin' for a dame.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.069
Aren't we all?

00:33.212 --> 00:34.683
This one's special.
You know her?

00:35.814 --> 00:36.513
Know her?

00:37.418 --> 00:38.336
I'm lookin' at her.

00:49.190 --> 00:50.604
And where have you
been all my life?

00:55.259 --> 00:57.225
Talk about a slice of history.

00:57.468 --> 00:58.656
The Pennybaker Club.

00:59.064 --> 01:01.125
You know, back in the '40s,
all the greats played here.

01:01.126 --> 01:03.671
If these walls could talk, man,
the stories they would tell.

01:03.710 --> 01:06.155
Yeah, but the only story we
need to hear is about...

01:06.291 --> 01:08.968
Stan Banks. Single 
GSW to the sternum.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.491
I'm calling the time
of death between

01:10.492 --> 01:11.999
6:00 and 8:00 this morning.

01:12.260 --> 01:14.362
Looks like he tried to
defend himself with this.

01:14.733 --> 01:16.021
Obviously, it didn't work.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.430
So a robbery gone wrong?

01:17.668 --> 01:19.971
Well, he still had
his wallet, cell,

01:19.972 --> 01:22.080
and a room key from the
Parksville Arms, so...

01:22.361 --> 01:23.456
Pockets were pulled out,

01:23.457 --> 01:25.581
indicating the killer
searched the body.

01:25.785 --> 01:26.849
For what, we have no idea.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.245
That's weird.
He's got an SRO key,

01:29.246 --> 01:32.670
but his driver's license has
him living on 34th Street.

01:32.753 --> 01:33.729
We'll hit the SRO.

01:33.816 --> 01:35.245
See if there's anything we
can find out about him.

01:35.333 --> 01:35.973
Thanks.

01:37.341 --> 01:38.521
You lookin' for a drink, Castle?

01:38.522 --> 01:39.873
'Cause I'm pretty sure
the bar is closed.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.953
Actually, I was
looking for a clue.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.232
I think I found one.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.200
Some homeless guy's squat, and...

01:45.648 --> 01:48.095
today's "Ledger."
He was here this morning.

01:48.232 --> 01:50.371
Well, whoever he is,
maybe he saw something.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.689
I'll get patrol units
to canvass the area.

01:53.139 --> 01:54.088
Stan's dead?

01:55.214 --> 01:56.440
Well, that's just great.

01:56.441 --> 01:58.851
What am I supposed to
do with all his crap?

01:59.003 --> 02:01.324
We'll be taking some
of it off your hands

02:01.325 --> 02:02.367
as part of our investigation.

02:02.616 --> 02:04.278
You know of anyone who's been
threatening Stan lately?

02:04.279 --> 02:06.159
I'm the manager here,
not the den mother.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.401
Okay, then.
When was the last time you saw him?

02:08.948 --> 02:10.752
Uh, this morning.
Stan was all smiles.

02:10.752 --> 02:13.561
Gave notice he was moving out
'cause his ship was coming in.

02:13.999 --> 02:15.504
- What ship?
- Oh, I don't know.

02:15.505 --> 02:17.125
The "Titanic" from
the looks of things.

02:17.825 --> 02:18.859
Well, if you can
remember anything else,

02:18.860 --> 02:19.952
can you please give me a call?

02:20.376 --> 02:21.714
Don't hold your breath, hotshot.

02:23.431 --> 02:24.252
I think she likes you.

02:24.610 --> 02:27.024
I have no idea why Stan was
at the Pennybaker Club.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.324
But we've been separated
for almost a year,

02:29.325 --> 02:31.068
so God knows where he's been.

02:31.489 --> 02:33.124
And when was the last
time you spoke with him?

02:33.125 --> 02:34.985
Two months ago, which is crazy,

02:35.426 --> 02:38.041
'cause there was a time we couldn't
go two hours without talking.

02:38.823 --> 02:40.623
But then Stan had to go
and find that doubloon.

02:40.984 --> 02:43.497
A doubloon, as in
old Spanish coin?

02:43.574 --> 02:45.815
He dug one up on a beach
in North Carolina.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.551
And after that, he got the bug.

02:48.226 --> 02:50.660
And it only got worse after he
saw this stupid documentary

02:50.661 --> 02:52.898
about Clyde Belasco,
the treasure hunter.

02:53.232 --> 02:54.851
Yeah, that's the fellow

02:54.852 --> 02:56.727
who found that sunken
confederate ship ten years ago.

02:56.860 --> 02:57.917
Stan was so inspired,

02:58.056 --> 03:00.828
he quit his accounting job to
search for lost antiquities.

03:01.328 --> 03:02.628
I mean, even the
last time we spoke,

03:02.629 --> 03:04.671
all he could talk about
was how he was close

03:04.672 --> 03:07.199
to finding a blue butterfly.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.788
A blue... like an insect?

03:10.492 --> 03:11.170
Who knows?

03:11.220 --> 03:13.474
Was he having problems with
anyone that you know of?

03:13.770 --> 03:15.263
He had money problems.
I know that.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.007
I got a call two days
ago from some guy

03:18.329 --> 03:19.150
looking for Stan.

03:19.256 --> 03:21.355
Said that Stan owed him $10,000

03:21.703 --> 03:22.932
and that he'd better pay

03:23.747 --> 03:24.504
or else.

03:26.527 --> 03:28.050
There's nothing in
Stan's personal effects

03:28.051 --> 03:29.935
about butterflies,
blue or otherwise.

03:30.082 --> 03:30.920
Just a bunch of books

03:30.921 --> 03:33.431
about mobsters and
Manhattan in the '40s.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.615
That's all right,
because I got a hit

03:35.616 --> 03:37.659
on that threatening money
call to Stan's wife,

03:37.660 --> 03:39.390
and it turns out it came
from a dry cleaners.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.599
Maybe clothes aren't the only
thing they're laundering.

03:41.797 --> 03:42.534
I'll check it out.

03:42.547 --> 03:43.210
Thanks.

03:46.575 --> 03:48.917
Uh, this diary in Stan's stuff,

03:48.918 --> 03:50.031
it's also from the '40s.

03:50.049 --> 03:51.561
It sounds like it belonged
to a private eye.

03:51.562 --> 03:52.264
Listen to this.

03:52.872 --> 03:54.416
"Usually wives turn
on the waterworks

03:54.417 --> 03:56.465
"when shown pictures of their
husbands stepping out,

03:56.857 --> 03:57.773
"but not this dame.

03:58.228 --> 04:00.361
"She wanted payback.
So what's worse,

04:00.713 --> 04:02.027
"that I pitched
woo with a client

04:02.211 --> 04:04.382
or that I invoiced her for
services rendered after?"

04:06.087 --> 04:06.702
Cute.

04:06.967 --> 04:07.579
Cute?

04:08.153 --> 04:10.646
I mean, this guy sounds
like a hard-boiled PI.

04:10.647 --> 04:12.132
Right out of a Raymond
Chandler novel.

04:13.028 --> 04:14.331
I wonder why Stan had this?

04:15.128 --> 04:15.765
Hey, yo, Beckett.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.628
Still got no word on
that homeless guy,

04:17.629 --> 04:19.528
but a bodega owner
saw a white Mustang

04:19.529 --> 04:21.156
parked in the loading zone
right outside the club

04:21.156 --> 04:22.067
for the past three days.

04:22.196 --> 04:24.217
Okay. See if anyone saw
those license plates.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.406
- Right on.
- Okay.

04:26.192 --> 04:27.613
Um, Beckett?

04:28.884 --> 04:30.098
Can I take this
home for the night?

04:30.370 --> 04:32.063
I mean, it might be the key
to what Stan was looking for.

04:32.132 --> 04:33.771
You just want to read it
because you think it's cool.

04:34.165 --> 04:35.062
Yeah, well, that, too.

04:35.679 --> 04:37.317
Okay, just so long as you...

04:39.354 --> 04:40.746
bring it back in the morning.

04:53.258 --> 04:55.917
"June 18, 1947.

04:57.211 --> 04:58.837
"The day began like every other,

04:59.708 --> 05:01.250
"pulling awake in
my office chair

05:01.251 --> 05:03.127
"with a cream of
Kentucky bottle,

05:03.887 --> 05:04.729
"a dry throat,

05:05.269 --> 05:07.126
"and a head that was
ringing like church bells.

05:08.439 --> 05:11.345
"So I figured I'd kill
two birds with one stone

05:11.442 --> 05:13.169
with a little hair of
the dog that bit me."

05:19.793 --> 05:21.251
Damn it, Mr. Flynn.

05:21.293 --> 05:22.221
Why have an apartment

05:22.222 --> 05:24.403
when you drink yourself to sleep
in the office every night?

05:24.404 --> 05:25.663
That way, I'm never
late for work.

05:25.843 --> 05:26.664
Say, what gives, anyhow?

05:26.727 --> 05:29.244
We have a potential
client, so be nice.

05:30.088 --> 05:32.098
I'd like to make
next month's rent

05:32.237 --> 05:33.480
if you don't mind.

05:35.128 --> 05:36.241
All right?

05:36.443 --> 05:37.158
How do I look?

05:37.159 --> 05:38.066
Like a star.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.830
"Just another day on the
Isle of Manhattan"...

05:42.242 --> 05:43.354
"Until she walked in

05:43.876 --> 05:45.365
"with a case that
changed my life.

05:46.909 --> 05:49.043
"Wearing t-strap shoes
and a country suit,

05:49.044 --> 05:50.036
"I could tell that that redhead

05:50.037 --> 05:51.378
was a hick fresh off the cob."

05:53.812 --> 05:55.673
Hello. My name's Sally Mulqueen.

05:56.410 --> 05:58.559
I mean, Scofield.
Sorry, I'm a newlywed.

05:58.622 --> 05:59.921
Still gettin' used to the name.

06:00.609 --> 06:01.876
Joe Flynn, Mrs. Scofield.

06:02.259 --> 06:03.930
So tell me, what has you
knocking on my shingle?

06:05.695 --> 06:07.435
I-I talked my husband
into honeymoonin'

06:07.436 --> 06:08.598
up here in the Big Apple,

06:08.821 --> 06:11.163
but not because I wanted
to climb skyscrapers

06:11.164 --> 06:12.235
and see Broadway shows.

06:13.180 --> 06:14.826
I had myself another reason.

06:15.593 --> 06:18.147
See, I'm lookin' for
my big sister Vera.

06:18.522 --> 06:19.419
Vera Mulqueen.

06:19.929 --> 06:21.612
There was bad blood back home,

06:21.613 --> 06:23.179
and Vera ran off two years ago

06:23.180 --> 06:25.693
with dreams of being a showgirl
up here in the big city.

06:26.129 --> 06:28.410
She send you a wire, postcard,
anything with a return address?

06:30.457 --> 06:31.549
Can you find her, mister?

06:33.178 --> 06:34.509
Mama's sick, and, um...

06:35.149 --> 06:36.161
doesn't have long.

06:37.195 --> 06:38.248
Well, of course he can.

06:39.021 --> 06:40.835
For 15 bucks a day
plus expenses.

06:44.122 --> 06:45.037
Only...

06:45.549 --> 06:46.621
can we keep this quiet?

06:47.733 --> 06:49.559
Like I said, there's
bad blood back home,

06:49.560 --> 06:51.355
and if Vera hears
from a stranger

06:51.372 --> 06:52.644
that the family's
looking for her,

06:53.070 --> 06:54.599
it might push her farther away.

06:55.913 --> 06:56.750
Mrs. Scofield,

06:57.394 --> 06:59.064
if I'm anything, I'm discreet.

07:03.889 --> 07:04.869
"And that's when I saw her.

07:05.915 --> 07:08.231
"Looking at that photograph,
all I could think was,

07:09.007 --> 07:10.084
what a beautiful doll."

07:13.858 --> 07:16.137
"Sally said Vera had dreams
of being a showgirl.

07:16.288 --> 07:17.039
"Maybe she made it.

07:17.610 --> 07:19.262
Stranger things have
happened in this town."

07:24.489 --> 07:26.437
"My last stop was the
Pennybaker Club.

07:27.730 --> 07:30.449
I was hoping my favorite
performer Satchmo was blowing."

07:30.513 --> 07:32.153
"But no such luck.

07:33.930 --> 07:34.904
"Couldn't complain, though,

07:35.782 --> 07:37.974
"because Betsy
Sinclair was up there,

07:38.925 --> 07:41.043
and that songbird's
got golden pipes."

07:45.222 --> 07:45.843
Whiskey.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.465
"I'll be damned if
all that walking

07:47.466 --> 07:49.318
"didn't get the shrapnel
in my hip buzzing.

07:50.145 --> 07:51.491
But I knew where to
get my medicine."

08:00.038 --> 08:01.853
Say, maybe you can help me.
I'm lookin' for a dame.

08:02.242 --> 08:02.926
Aren't we all?

08:03.419 --> 08:04.899
This one's special.
You know her?

08:06.074 --> 08:06.671
Know her?

08:07.675 --> 08:08.539
I'm lookin' at her.

08:20.658 --> 08:22.121
And where have you
been all my life?

08:23.519 --> 08:24.440
"What was I thinking?

08:25.328 --> 08:27.136
"This dame was
trouble on two legs.

08:28.707 --> 08:30.298
"I kept telling
myself to look away.

08:31.169 --> 08:32.828
"She was with Tom Dempsey,
for crying out loud--

08:32.828 --> 08:34.341
"the most ruthless mob boss

08:34.342 --> 08:35.801
New York has ever
given birth to."

08:41.308 --> 08:43.033
"Dempsey sent over two
of his gorillas--

08:43.520 --> 08:44.249
"an Irishman,

08:44.648 --> 08:47.203
and a Cuban on loan from
some Havana mob family."

08:48.452 --> 08:49.792
The boss wants to
see you, boy-o.

08:50.609 --> 08:51.423
Sorry, boys.

08:52.410 --> 08:53.389
My dance card's full.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.402
This isn't a request, compadre.

09:03.158 --> 09:03.863
You know who I am?

09:04.512 --> 09:06.274
The waiter? I'll take a whiskey.

09:06.364 --> 09:07.981
The boys here can share
a sloe gin fizz.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.217
Better watch yourself,
there, boy-o.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.522
Hold your tongue,
or I'll cut it out.

09:10.722 --> 09:11.384
Mm, a wise guy.

09:13.746 --> 09:14.607
I hate wise guys

09:14.608 --> 09:16.949
about as much as I hate
crumbs eyeballing my girl.

09:17.543 --> 09:19.050
It's rude, uncivil.

09:20.205 --> 09:21.199
That's all right, friend.

09:21.255 --> 09:22.751
The boys are gonna teach
you some lessons.

09:23.304 --> 09:24.636
Okay, boy-o, first lesson.

09:38.927 --> 09:39.687
Over here. Get him.

09:54.157 --> 09:54.877
"There I was,

09:55.359 --> 09:57.657
"covered in the discards
of the blue plate special,

09:57.747 --> 09:59.646
"asking myself,
was it worth it?"

10:02.821 --> 10:03.454
"It was.

10:04.039 --> 10:05.758
She was worth every punch."

10:06.263 --> 10:06.922
Are you hurt?

10:07.360 --> 10:08.074
What, this?

10:09.177 --> 10:09.817
It's nothin'.

10:10.926 --> 10:12.798
You should see what my face
did to the other guy's fist.

10:15.638 --> 10:17.095
So what's your name, tough guy?

10:18.032 --> 10:18.864
Does it matter, doll?

10:19.389 --> 10:20.029
Vera!

10:20.958 --> 10:22.409
You know you're not
supposed to leave our sight

10:22.410 --> 10:23.708
with the boss' hardware on.

10:30.683 --> 10:31.449
The blue butterfly.

10:32.538 --> 10:33.362
It's a necklace.

10:34.590 --> 10:35.978
That's why Stan
Banks was killed.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.064
Why am I narrating?

10:40.901 --> 10:46.112

10:52.409 --> 10:54.496
So anything on that threatening
call to the dry cleaners?

10:54.497 --> 10:56.412
Yeah, the owner claims he doesn't
know anything about Stan

10:56.413 --> 10:58.094
or blue butterflies.

10:58.155 --> 11:01.049
However, a guy named Ray
Horton rents out a back room.

11:01.050 --> 11:03.426
Turns out Ray is a
bookie on parole.

11:03.582 --> 11:05.965
Okay, so maybe Stan was trying
to meet Ray at the Pennybaker

11:05.966 --> 11:07.302
so that he could pay
off some debts?

11:07.517 --> 11:09.898
Uh, Stan was not there
because of his debt.

11:10.065 --> 11:12.277
He was not even there
about a blue butterfly.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.909
He was there about
The Blue Butterfly.

11:16.223 --> 11:17.195
It's a necklace.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.783
A butterfly-shaped centerpiece
made entirely of...

11:20.207 --> 11:20.974
blue diamonds.

11:20.975 --> 11:23.692
Worth about a million
dollars, easy.

11:23.890 --> 11:25.095
Where are you getting
all of this?

11:25.096 --> 11:26.120
From the PI's diary.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.664
So Stan was on a treasure hunt.

11:27.665 --> 11:28.886
Exactly.
I did a little research.

11:28.887 --> 11:31.162
I turns out the blue
butterfly disappeared

11:31.478 --> 11:32.920
sometime in the '40s,

11:32.921 --> 11:35.607
and rumor has it,
it's hidden somewhere

11:35.608 --> 11:36.567
in the Pennybaker Club.

11:37.192 --> 11:38.271
If he found it...

11:38.726 --> 11:41.041
A million-dollar necklace?
Talk about motive for murder.

11:41.042 --> 11:42.353
By the way, Ryan, say boy-o.

11:43.066 --> 11:43.963
- Boy-o.
- Boy-o.

11:43.964 --> 11:44.968
- Boy-o.
- Boy-o.

11:45.027 --> 11:46.098
- Boy- o.
- Boy-o.

11:46.099 --> 11:47.229
- Boy- o.
- Anyway.

11:47.931 --> 11:49.048
Did some searching on the net.

11:49.049 --> 11:50.157
There wasn't a lot there.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.959
But I found, it's
supposedly cursed,

11:52.095 --> 11:55.530
and at one time belonged to an
SS officer's mistress.

11:55.866 --> 11:57.634
After the war, made
its way stateside

11:57.659 --> 12:00.862
and into the hands of
mob boss Tom Dempsey,

12:01.193 --> 12:03.276
who owned the club, which
is why we need to go back.

12:03.498 --> 12:04.490
- We do?
- Yeah.

12:04.642 --> 12:05.696
You remember the, uh,

12:05.697 --> 12:08.020
green rod we found
in Stan's hand?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.140
Apparently, Dempsey's
downstairs office

12:10.141 --> 12:12.053
was painted shamrock green.

12:12.245 --> 12:13.741
Stan had to have
gone down there.

12:13.854 --> 12:16.536
Also, according to the diary,
the blue butterfly was kept

12:16.815 --> 12:18.914
in a secret safe in
Dempsey's office.

12:19.541 --> 12:21.525
It's very possible
we missed something.

12:21.526 --> 12:22.765
We never really
looked down there.

12:22.962 --> 12:25.063
Okay, Ryan, you see if you
can get ahold of the bookie.

12:25.064 --> 12:26.569
Castle and I will go back
to the crime scene.

12:26.585 --> 12:27.367
Okay.

12:27.565 --> 12:28.549
- Boy-o.
- Boy-o.

12:28.639 --> 12:29.397
- Boy-o.
- Boy-o.

12:29.566 --> 12:30.524
- Like a leprechaun.
- Castle.

12:30.525 --> 12:31.312
Sorry.

12:32.843 --> 12:34.008
So the PI tells Sally

12:34.009 --> 12:36.053
that he found her sister
here at the Pennybaker Club.

12:36.141 --> 12:37.483
And did Sally go
talk to her sister?

12:37.551 --> 12:39.293
Well, no.
Joe could tell that Sally,

12:39.294 --> 12:40.833
being an innocent girl
from the country,

12:41.149 --> 12:42.850
she was a little bit nervous
about dealing with mobsters,

12:42.851 --> 12:44.810
so he offered to go back and
make contact with Vera.

12:44.811 --> 12:46.353
Out of the goodness of
his heart, I'm sure.

12:46.369 --> 12:48.222
Can you blame the guy?
I mean, she was gorgeous.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.834
So anyway, Joe tells Sally he's
gonna go arrange a meeting.

12:51.361 --> 12:55.947
Sally agreed, but again,
insisted that Joe not tell Vera

12:56.558 --> 12:57.810
that she was looking for her

12:57.859 --> 12:59.799
because of all the
animosity back home.

13:00.579 --> 13:01.879
Ah. I was right.

13:03.187 --> 13:05.796
I bet that's where he
got the steel rod,

13:05.913 --> 13:09.021
which is probably what he used
to pry open the secret safe.

13:09.347 --> 13:10.892
Hate to burst bubbles, Castle,

13:10.893 --> 13:13.117
but this hasn't held
anything in years.

13:13.989 --> 13:15.610
Looks like Stan
was disappointed.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.158
Yeah, he probably would've been

13:17.307 --> 13:19.390
if that was the secret safe.

13:19.598 --> 13:20.884
That's not the secret safe?

13:21.213 --> 13:22.224
Here's a fun fact--

13:22.661 --> 13:24.569
people often kept two safes,

13:24.570 --> 13:27.341
one that was easy to find
for minor valuables,

13:27.342 --> 13:30.170
and a second safe that was
much harder to locate

13:30.367 --> 13:32.794
for the extra specials,
like blue butterflies.

13:32.852 --> 13:34.893
Castle, where's the secret safe?

13:34.992 --> 13:35.821
Coming to that.

13:35.859 --> 13:38.499
So it's five days since
Joe and Vera met.

13:38.559 --> 13:39.974
And they were very much in love.

13:39.975 --> 13:41.263
After only five days? Come on.

13:41.264 --> 13:43.075
Well, people didn't waste
time back in the '40s.

13:43.076 --> 13:44.365
Matter of fact, they
were so much in love...

13:45.677 --> 13:46.552
Well, they risked it all.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.382
So what does that have to
do with our secret safe?

13:49.810 --> 13:52.354
And it happened backstage.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.487
Right upstairs.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.634
They were stealing
a moment together,

13:57.635 --> 13:59.743
which was dangerous, because
she was Dempsey's girl.

14:00.672 --> 14:02.091
As they stared into
each other's eyes,

14:02.720 --> 14:04.138
Kate's heart quickened.

14:04.479 --> 14:06.280
Did you just say "Kate"?

14:06.912 --> 14:09.004
Are you picturing
the PI as you

14:09.077 --> 14:10.659
and me as the gangster's moll?

14:10.762 --> 14:12.877
What? No.

14:13.283 --> 14:14.428
And I didn't say "Kate."

14:14.431 --> 14:17.354
I said "fate."
"Fate's heart quickened."

14:17.591 --> 14:20.002
I was being poetic. God.

14:20.255 --> 14:21.863
Anyway, as I was saying,

14:22.681 --> 14:24.744
they were just about
to kiss when...

14:25.728 --> 14:26.577
Oye, chico!

14:27.063 --> 14:27.749
Who's that?

14:27.796 --> 14:30.572
Hey, boy-o.
You must be a slow learner.

14:32.793 --> 14:33.821
There's my baby.

14:37.408 --> 14:38.603
He's with you, Miss Sinclair?

14:39.282 --> 14:39.979
Yes,

14:40.143 --> 14:41.874
and I don't appreciate you lugs

14:41.875 --> 14:43.905
mopping the floor with
him the other night.

14:44.114 --> 14:47.028
Not for nothin', but you need
to keep this on the hush-hush.

14:47.768 --> 14:49.746
Dempsey's not too keen
about mixed laundry.

14:49.966 --> 14:51.669
Well, then we'll just keep
this our little secret.

14:51.670 --> 14:52.402
What do you say?

14:52.718 --> 14:53.617
All right, fellas.

14:56.106 --> 14:57.460
You better wise up, Vera.

14:57.515 --> 14:59.514
Dempsey will have you
butchered if he finds out.

14:59.515 --> 15:01.066
I mean, he's a hell of
a smoocher and all,

15:01.067 --> 15:01.789
but, damn it, girl,

15:01.790 --> 15:03.489
is this yum-yum really worth it?

15:03.490 --> 15:04.934
He's the cream in my coffee.

15:04.935 --> 15:07.250
You two are a
walking fairy tale.

15:07.251 --> 15:08.979
Good lord.

15:09.627 --> 15:10.575
Come on.

15:15.427 --> 15:16.588
Betsy's right, you know?

15:16.589 --> 15:18.948
Dempsey will scrag us for sure
if he catches us turtle-doving.

15:18.949 --> 15:20.748
You gotta get me
away from here, Joe,

15:20.749 --> 15:23.112
away from Dempsey,
away from all of it.

15:23.113 --> 15:25.833
Oh, yeah, and go where?
We can blow this town, sure.

15:25.834 --> 15:27.894
Only how far are we gonna get
when we're both flat broke?

15:27.895 --> 15:29.696
We're not broke, Joe.

15:30.116 --> 15:32.606
We've got all the money we
need and more around my neck.

15:32.607 --> 15:34.416
All we gotta do is
take it away with us.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.846
What, are you daffy?

15:36.040 --> 15:37.632
You got at least two brunos
with you at all times

15:37.633 --> 15:38.794
when you're wearing that thing.

15:38.795 --> 15:39.963
It's funny.

15:40.422 --> 15:42.038
Back when I was a
cigarette girl,

15:42.039 --> 15:44.061
I'd watch Dempsey coming
in with his girlfriend

15:44.062 --> 15:45.658
wearing this thing
around her neck,

15:45.659 --> 15:46.951
and I wanted it.

15:46.952 --> 15:49.190
Pretty soon, I was his
girl and I had it.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.508
But it's not a necklace, Joe.
It's a diamond noose,

15:52.509 --> 15:53.963
and it's getting
harder to breathe.

15:53.964 --> 15:56.338
Then we gotta turn that
noose into a lifeline.

15:56.991 --> 15:58.409
The question is, how?

16:00.507 --> 16:03.088
When I'm not wearing it, Dempsey
keeps it in a secret safe,

16:03.089 --> 16:04.548
and I know where it is.

16:09.019 --> 16:10.025
And?

16:10.519 --> 16:11.641
And...

16:12.496 --> 16:13.154
that's it.

16:13.155 --> 16:15.517
That was the last
entry in the diary.

16:15.518 --> 16:17.941
What do you mean, that's it?
What happened to Joe?

16:17.942 --> 16:20.000
- What happened to Vera?
- I don't know.

16:20.001 --> 16:22.486
Well, why would you tell a story
when you don't know the ending?

16:22.487 --> 16:24.623
If you wanted a beginning
and a middle and an end,

16:24.624 --> 16:26.226
I have 27 novels you
can choose from.

16:26.227 --> 16:27.583
Ugh.

16:28.752 --> 16:30.884
Okay, so where is
this secret safe?

16:30.885 --> 16:33.693
I don't know, but I think
Stan must have found it.

16:33.694 --> 16:35.475
Maybe that's why he
needed that rod,

16:35.476 --> 16:37.284
to pry open a wall or something.

16:37.285 --> 16:38.994
Castle, look at the molding.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.218
What...

16:48.803 --> 16:50.004
It's unlocked.

16:51.021 --> 16:52.365
Stan found it.

16:52.656 --> 16:54.223
That's why he was killed.

16:54.224 --> 16:55.623
But by whom?

16:55.858 --> 16:57.429
Ray Horton.

16:57.430 --> 17:00.147
Assault, battery, and now
you're using a dry cleaners

17:00.148 --> 17:02.087
to front your
bookmaking operation.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.461
Whoa. Slow your roll.

17:03.462 --> 17:04.916
A man on parole like myself

17:04.917 --> 17:06.958
can't be mixed up in bookmaking.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.573
How about murder, Ray?

17:09.440 --> 17:11.148
Is it okay to get
mixed up in that?

17:12.388 --> 17:13.439
Stan?

17:13.440 --> 17:15.222
And who--who killed him?

17:16.406 --> 17:17.489
Me?

17:17.490 --> 17:19.752
Why would I kill my
business partner?

17:19.752 --> 17:21.510
Your business partner? Come on.

17:21.511 --> 17:22.642
It's true, man.

17:22.643 --> 17:24.675
One of my clients hooked us up.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.525
He knew that I was
looking to diversify

17:26.526 --> 17:29.662
and that Stan needed financing
to find this lost necklace.

17:29.663 --> 17:31.888
Stan told me he needed
10 g's for expenses

17:31.889 --> 17:34.451
and to buy this old private
detective's diary.

17:35.064 --> 17:37.226
So I agreed to back him
for half the profits.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.871
Well, if that's true, then why
did you threaten Stan's wife?

17:39.872 --> 17:43.063
Because Stan was ducking me.
I thought I got played.

17:43.175 --> 17:44.694
Then he came up to
me two days ago,

17:44.695 --> 17:45.977
and he told me what was up.

17:45.978 --> 17:47.928
He said he found the man
with the missing piece

17:47.929 --> 17:49.612
of the puzzle to the
blue butterfly.

17:49.613 --> 17:51.356
- And who's this man?
- I don't know.

17:51.357 --> 17:53.085
But if Stan found
the blue butterfly,

17:53.086 --> 17:54.857
that's probably who killed him.

17:56.752 --> 17:59.785
So I traced the diary.
Stan did his research.

17:59.786 --> 18:01.783
He purchased it from
the granddaughter

18:01.784 --> 18:03.656
of Joe's old secretary,

18:03.657 --> 18:05.245
a woman by the name
of Ruth Huntsacker.

18:05.246 --> 18:06.018
So?

18:06.019 --> 18:07.719
So I spoke to Mrs. Huntsacker.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.555
She said, she might still have
some of the PI's old papers

18:10.556 --> 18:12.079
and they might be able to
tell us what happened.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.198
She's gonna have her
son look for them

18:13.199 --> 18:14.696
and then call me back.

18:14.697 --> 18:17.001
Look, Castle, I admit
that Joe and Vera's story

18:17.002 --> 18:18.777
is fun and romantic,

18:18.778 --> 18:21.003
but whatever happened
back in 1947

18:21.004 --> 18:23.392
has nothing to do with
who murdered Stan.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.692
Uh... I'm not so sure
about that.

18:25.693 --> 18:26.922
Our bookie alibied out.

18:26.923 --> 18:29.735
But ballistics came in,
and we got a match.

18:29.917 --> 18:31.856
The 38-caliber revolver
that killed Stan

18:31.857 --> 18:34.608
was used in an unsolved
double homicide

18:34.842 --> 18:36.532
in 1947.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.754
I knew there was a connection.

18:38.755 --> 18:39.783
Who were the victims?

18:39.784 --> 18:42.017
Uh, some lady named
Vera Mulqueen

18:42.018 --> 18:44.196
and a private detective
named Joe Flynn.

18:51.845 --> 18:53.113
Murdered.

18:53.318 --> 18:54.610
That's too bad.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.860
I really thought those two
crazy kids were gonna make it.

18:56.861 --> 18:59.056
Yeah, not exactly the
ending I was hoping for.

18:59.057 --> 19:00.799
I didn't even know ballistics
went back that far.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.982
Oh, yeah. Since the '20s.

19:01.983 --> 19:03.147
Being that it's an old case,

19:03.148 --> 19:04.259
there's not much in the system.

19:04.260 --> 19:06.075
The remains of Joe Flynn
and Vera Mulqueen

19:06.076 --> 19:07.168
were found in Flynn's car.

19:09.438 --> 19:11.658
Both victims were shot
with a .38 revolver

19:11.659 --> 19:13.415
and the car was set on fire.

19:13.416 --> 19:14.863
Only suspect was Tom Dempsey,

19:14.864 --> 19:16.608
but there was never enough
evidence to arrest.

19:16.609 --> 19:18.654
You know what?
I bet you Dempsey caught the two of them

19:18.655 --> 19:20.716
trying to run away together,
and he killed them.

19:20.757 --> 19:22.145
But how does Stan's killer

19:22.146 --> 19:24.362
get Dempsey's gun
60 years later?

19:24.363 --> 19:25.805
Unless...

19:25.806 --> 19:27.328
Dempsey killed Stan.

19:27.329 --> 19:30.339
He'd be, what, like 90 years
old, but it's still possible?

19:30.429 --> 19:31.778
Couldn't have been Dempsey.

19:31.779 --> 19:32.724
He died of a heart attack

19:32.725 --> 19:34.737
four months after Joe
and Vera were killed.

19:35.653 --> 19:36.768
Still...

19:37.151 --> 19:39.413
We should dig up that
1947 police report.

19:39.414 --> 19:41.243
There could be something
in there about the gun

19:41.244 --> 19:42.667
that could shed some
light on Stan's murder.

19:42.668 --> 19:43.918
All right.
I'll go to the warehouse

19:43.919 --> 19:45.018
and I'll pull up the
old case files.

19:45.019 --> 19:47.362
Oh, oh, uh, I want to go.

19:48.753 --> 19:50.145
Uh, okay.

19:50.146 --> 19:51.772
- Can I drive?
- I don't care.

19:53.878 --> 19:54.894
Hey.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.347
So...

19:56.453 --> 19:58.217
I did a search of guns
Dempsey used to own.

19:58.218 --> 19:59.714
Turns out there was
an estate sale

19:59.715 --> 20:01.412
where a treasure hunter
named Clyde Belasco

20:01.413 --> 20:04.373
bought all of Dempsey's
firearms, including 2 .38s.

20:04.374 --> 20:06.017
Wait. Clyde Belasco?

20:06.024 --> 20:07.038
Stan's wife said that

20:07.039 --> 20:09.302
the two of them watched a
documentary about him,

20:09.303 --> 20:11.803
and that inspired Stan to
become a treasure hunter.

20:11.804 --> 20:13.305
Well, the connections
don't stop there.

20:13.306 --> 20:15.187
Belasco flew in from
France a week ago,

20:15.188 --> 20:16.780
and I just found an
article that said

20:16.781 --> 20:19.501
that he searched for the
blue butterfly for 15 years.

20:19.502 --> 20:21.857
That bookie said that
Stan found someone

20:21.858 --> 20:24.152
who had the missing
piece of the puzzle.

20:24.153 --> 20:25.527
Well, maybe Belasco's
that someone.

20:27.230 --> 20:28.400
Here it is.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.615
This has been dusted
off recently.

20:32.738 --> 20:33.579
Looks like we're
not the only ones

20:33.580 --> 20:35.086
interested in this case.

20:35.838 --> 20:37.858
Stan was here. Had to be.

20:37.859 --> 20:40.189
Think about it--
the diary, the murders...

20:40.190 --> 20:42.123
All we're doing is walking
in his footsteps.

20:42.124 --> 20:43.952
This is the next
piece of the puzzle.

20:44.051 --> 20:47.167
Huh. Crime scene photo
of Vera and the PI.

20:48.588 --> 20:49.406
Damn it, Joe.

20:49.407 --> 20:50.632
You old sap.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.940
Dizzy with a dame and
got yourself cooked.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.656
So, Mr. Bogart, what exactly
are we looking for here?

20:55.657 --> 20:58.183
Our 1947 murders and
our present-day murder

20:58.184 --> 21:00.840
have to be connected by
more than just a gun.

21:00.841 --> 21:03.204
Somewhere in here
is that connection.

21:04.824 --> 21:07.197
Yes, I bought several of
Tom Dempsey's revolvers.

21:07.198 --> 21:09.944
And by all means, test fire every
last one of them as you wish.

21:09.945 --> 21:12.971
We will. Now...
how do you know Stan?

21:12.972 --> 21:15.096
You have to understand
that I'm on television.

21:15.097 --> 21:16.461
Articles are written about me.

21:16.462 --> 21:18.853
Because of this, the
amateurs come a-knocking.

21:18.854 --> 21:21.297
It's an occupational hazard.

21:21.551 --> 21:23.803
And what was the purpose
of Stan's visit?

21:23.804 --> 21:26.058
Why, the blue
butterfly, of course.

21:26.462 --> 21:28.398
He must have read of my
exploits searching for it

21:28.399 --> 21:31.760
and decided to burden me
with his preposterous story.

21:31.761 --> 21:33.047
And what story was that?

21:33.048 --> 21:35.844
That he had found an old
private investigator's diary,

21:35.845 --> 21:38.291
which held missing clues.

21:38.774 --> 21:39.668
You didn't believe him?

21:39.669 --> 21:40.613
Of course not.

21:40.614 --> 21:43.035
When I asked to see the
alleged diary, he refused.

21:43.036 --> 21:44.613
And yet, he wanted access

21:44.614 --> 21:46.882
to all my research on
the Pennybaker Club.

21:46.883 --> 21:49.733
I mean, really, the
whole thing was absurd.

21:49.734 --> 21:52.518
He even asked to exit
out the back door.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.290
Said a car was following him.

21:54.291 --> 21:55.814
It was a white Mustang.

21:56.209 --> 21:57.462
I guess someone
else was interested

21:57.463 --> 21:59.265
in the blue butterfly, too.

21:59.582 --> 22:01.621
It feels like we're looking
for a needle in a haystack,

22:01.622 --> 22:03.506
except for, we can't
find the haystack.

22:03.677 --> 22:06.402
Who needs a haystack when
the needle is right here?

22:06.730 --> 22:09.687
This is a statement from Joe's
secretary Mrs. Kennard.

22:09.688 --> 22:11.703
It was taken right
after his death.

22:11.849 --> 22:13.092
"Mrs. Florence Kennard,

22:13.093 --> 22:14.574
"secretary to the
victim Joe Flynn,

22:14.575 --> 22:16.592
"attested to bearing witness
to the following conversation

22:16.593 --> 22:20.819
between both victims on the
morning of June 24, 1947."

22:20.820 --> 22:22.545
I've worked this from
every angle, doll.

22:22.546 --> 22:25.037
There's no way we can crack
Dempsey's secret safe.

22:25.038 --> 22:26.189
Well, then how are
we gonna get it?

22:26.190 --> 22:28.549
Easy. You're gonna walk right
out the door with it tonight.

22:28.550 --> 22:29.558
How? It was hard enough

22:29.559 --> 22:31.528
shaking Dempsey's hatchet
men this morning.

22:31.529 --> 22:32.666
It's gonna be that much harder

22:32.667 --> 22:34.074
when I'm wearing the
blue butterfly.

22:34.075 --> 22:36.726
It'll be a cakewalk. Trust me.

22:36.883 --> 22:39.279
Especially with our friend
Jimmy Doyle helping us out.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.562
- And who's Jimmy Doyle?
- He's a prizefighter,

22:41.563 --> 22:43.377
and tonight he's taking
on Sugar Ray Robinson

22:43.378 --> 22:44.522
for the welterweight title.

22:44.523 --> 22:45.141
So?

22:45.142 --> 22:48.134
So every clover-loving
Irishman worth his salt

22:48.135 --> 22:49.415
will be huddled around
a radio tonight,

22:49.416 --> 22:50.915
cheering good ol' Jimmy on.

22:51.147 --> 22:53.272
You're gonna wait till a
rousing part of the fight.

22:53.273 --> 22:54.914
Then you're gonna
excuse yourself.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.340
Whoever's assigned
to be watching you

22:56.341 --> 22:57.631
surely won't be paying
much attention.

22:57.632 --> 23:00.491
That's when you slip
right out the back door,

23:00.901 --> 23:02.497
where I'll be waiting for you.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.133
Oh, Joe.

23:05.352 --> 23:06.532
It's perfect.

23:06.628 --> 23:08.560
No, it's crazy.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.566
What are you thinkin',
Mr. Flynn?

23:10.567 --> 23:12.918
And I can tell you,
this Jane's no good.

23:12.919 --> 23:14.125
Now what are you on about?

23:14.126 --> 23:17.789
Look at me. I'm a new man.
I'm a better man.

23:18.043 --> 23:19.913
I haven't even had a
drink since I met Vera,

23:19.914 --> 23:21.786
and if that's not a minor
miracle, I don't know what is.

23:21.787 --> 23:23.131
You would be better
off with the booze

23:23.132 --> 23:24.574
than with this chippy.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.557
A-and what are you basing
a relationship on, huh,

23:27.558 --> 23:29.708
a robbery and a lie?

23:29.709 --> 23:30.856
What lie?

23:32.201 --> 23:34.280
Well, I guess it's time
to come clean, huh?

23:34.281 --> 23:35.388
Look, doll,

23:35.591 --> 23:37.313
it's no coincidence I met
you in the club that night.

23:37.314 --> 23:38.889
I was hired to come
find you, see?

23:38.890 --> 23:40.412
Only I couldn't tell you who.

23:40.725 --> 23:41.633
It's just...

23:41.634 --> 23:44.343
Cut the corners, Joe.
Who hired you?

23:44.722 --> 23:45.943
It was your sister.

23:46.753 --> 23:47.823
Joe...

23:48.016 --> 23:49.777
I don't have a sister.

23:52.731 --> 23:53.598
What happens next?

23:53.621 --> 23:55.109
I don't know.
That's the end of the statement.

23:55.110 --> 23:57.350
But if Sally wasn't Vera's
sister, then who was she?

23:57.532 --> 23:59.486
Sally set up the PI.

23:59.578 --> 24:01.210
It's a classic film noir twist.

24:01.211 --> 24:03.033
- But why?
- I don't know.

24:03.034 --> 24:04.780
- What was Sally up to?
- I don't know.

24:04.781 --> 24:06.116
Do you think she was
connected to Dempsey?

24:06.117 --> 24:08.028
I don't know, but
isn't this great?

24:09.155 --> 24:10.261
Yo, Beckett.

24:10.462 --> 24:11.015
Hey.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.836
So our uniforms got a
line on that homeless guy

24:12.837 --> 24:14.043
who was squatting
in the Pennybaker.

24:14.044 --> 24:15.236
A hot dog vendor IDed him.

24:15.237 --> 24:17.671
Said the guy goes by the
name of West Side Wally.

24:17.672 --> 24:18.741
I put a want out on the guy.

24:18.742 --> 24:21.202
Great. That might be the break
we need to catch Stan's killer.

24:21.203 --> 24:21.935
Excuse me.

24:21.936 --> 24:23.502
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello.

24:24.329 --> 24:25.318
What?

24:25.552 --> 24:26.499
When?

24:26.978 --> 24:28.416
All right. I'm on my way.
Thank you.

24:28.417 --> 24:30.672
That was the manager of
Stan's residency hotel.

24:30.673 --> 24:32.370
A guy driving a white Mustang

24:32.371 --> 24:35.049
just forced his way into Stan's
room, and he's still there.

24:35.299 --> 24:36.979
NYPD! Show us your hands.

24:36.980 --> 24:38.477
Show us your hands. Now!

24:39.181 --> 24:40.867
Turn around slowly.

24:49.763 --> 24:51.199
You're Tom Dempsey.

24:51.705 --> 24:52.871
Yeah, that's me.

25:06.027 --> 25:08.602
Tom Dempsey III.

25:08.661 --> 25:09.923
Dead ringer.

25:10.415 --> 25:11.978
Complete doppelganger.

25:11.979 --> 25:14.565
It's DNA, guys.
It's not a magic trick.

25:14.588 --> 25:16.066
I'm his grandson.

25:16.231 --> 25:17.220
All right, look.

25:17.221 --> 25:19.074
I'm sorry I broke in a door.

25:19.314 --> 25:21.250
I'll pay for the damages.
It's no big deal.

25:21.251 --> 25:22.263
Why am I still here?

25:22.264 --> 25:23.888
Well, we were just
curious to see

25:23.889 --> 25:25.996
if you inherited anything
else from your grandfather,

25:25.997 --> 25:27.048
aside from his looks.

25:27.049 --> 25:29.435
Yeah, like one of his
.38 revolvers that you used

25:29.436 --> 25:30.983
to kill Stan Banks.

25:30.984 --> 25:32.973
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That didn't happen.

25:32.974 --> 25:34.722
Look, Stan came to me,

25:34.723 --> 25:37.491
only he told me his name
was Nathaniel Jenkins.

25:37.646 --> 25:39.111
He said he was a biographer,

25:39.112 --> 25:41.467
said he wanted to do a story
about my grandfather.

25:41.468 --> 25:43.782
He promised not to focus on
his underworld dealings,

25:43.783 --> 25:45.724
just on the--the good stuff,

25:45.725 --> 25:47.977
like how my granddad was a
pillar of the community.

25:47.978 --> 25:49.653
More like a killer
of the community.

25:49.654 --> 25:51.089
And so when he made his pitch,

25:51.090 --> 25:54.494
you, wanting to rehabilitate
your family name, cooperated.

25:54.495 --> 25:55.371
Yeah.

25:55.372 --> 25:57.697
I gave him access to all
of granddad's old papers,

25:57.698 --> 25:59.412
and everything was cool.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.060
Until I found out the
whole thing was a lie.

26:03.158 --> 26:04.491
And how'd you do that?

26:04.938 --> 26:07.916
There's this singer who used to
headline at my granddad's club--

26:07.917 --> 26:09.322
Betsy Sinclair.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.385
Couple weeks ago,
she passed away.

26:11.386 --> 26:13.161
Well, I went there
to pay my respects,

26:13.162 --> 26:14.600
and who do I see
there but Nathaniel,

26:14.601 --> 26:16.049
chatting up this old guy.

26:16.050 --> 26:17.966
He sees me, jets out the back.

26:17.967 --> 26:20.011
I'm like, "what the hell
is this all about," right?

26:20.012 --> 26:21.619
So I look in the guest book.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.606
I figured it out.

26:23.931 --> 26:26.897
He'd signed his real
name-- Stan Banks.

26:27.084 --> 26:29.548
Which is when you figured out
he wasn't really a biographer.

26:29.549 --> 26:31.472
He was just another
lowlife treasure hunter,

26:31.473 --> 26:33.149
looking for the blue butterfly.

26:33.150 --> 26:35.927
And if anybody deserved
the blue butterfly,

26:36.004 --> 26:37.349
it was you, right?

26:38.487 --> 26:39.986
So you followed Stan.

26:39.987 --> 26:42.023
And when Stan found
it, you shot him.

26:42.024 --> 26:44.222
No, I did not--
I did not shoot him.

26:45.435 --> 26:47.889
Stan--wait.
Stan did find it?

26:47.890 --> 26:49.402
Come on. You tell us.

26:49.403 --> 26:51.387
I don't know. I was not there.

26:51.388 --> 26:53.616
I read in the newspaper
that the guy was dead.

26:53.617 --> 26:55.731
I went to his apartment
to see what I could find.

26:55.867 --> 26:57.613
And I didn't kill the guy.

26:57.956 --> 26:59.596
So Dempsey's alibi holds up.

26:59.597 --> 27:01.165
He didn't kill Stan.

27:01.166 --> 27:03.879
Well, that's all right,
because we caught a break.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.589
Unis finally tracked
down West Side Wally.

27:05.590 --> 27:06.335
They're bringing him in now.

27:06.336 --> 27:07.725
Great. Maybe that
can shed some light

27:07.726 --> 27:09.050
as to what happened to Stan.

27:09.051 --> 27:11.023
And if he can't, maybe
Jerry Maddox can.

27:11.024 --> 27:12.405
Jerry Maddox?

27:12.406 --> 27:14.608
You remember how Tom III
told us that Stan

27:14.609 --> 27:16.199
went to Betsy
Sinclair's funeral?

27:16.200 --> 27:18.213
I started thinking,
why would he go?

27:18.214 --> 27:18.971
To do research.

27:18.972 --> 27:21.183
Right, but research on whom?

27:21.210 --> 27:23.082
So I stopped by the
funeral parlor.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.562
Turns out that Stan spent
an awful lot of time

27:25.563 --> 27:27.348
with a friend of the
deceased named Jerry Maddox.

27:27.349 --> 27:28.450
And get this--

27:28.451 --> 27:30.819
Jerry was the old bartender
at the Pennybaker Club,

27:30.954 --> 27:33.835
and probably the last living
link to the blue butterfly.

27:33.836 --> 27:34.684
Good job, Castle.

27:34.685 --> 27:35.814
Yeah?

27:36.220 --> 27:37.162
Yeah.

27:39.028 --> 27:40.028
Jerry.

27:40.052 --> 27:42.159
This is detective Beckett
and Mr. Castle.

27:42.160 --> 27:42.742
They wanted a word.

27:42.743 --> 27:43.889
Oh, yeah.

27:43.890 --> 27:46.274
You want some soup?
It's homemade.

27:46.275 --> 27:48.540
Oh, I don't mind if I do.
That smells delicious.

27:48.541 --> 27:51.625
Uh, no, thank you.
Actually, we're--we're all right.

27:55.976 --> 27:58.411
Am I hearing "I can't give
you anything but love"?

27:58.723 --> 28:00.099
That's right, kid.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.645
That's the best version
of that tune, too.

28:03.946 --> 28:05.417
You come here to
talk music, did you?

28:05.418 --> 28:07.969
Actually, we're here to
investigate Stan Banks' murder,

28:07.970 --> 28:09.653
and we were wondering
if you met him

28:09.654 --> 28:10.867
at Betsy Sinclair's funeral.

28:10.868 --> 28:12.707
Yeah. He--he was murdered?

28:12.708 --> 28:14.629
- Mm-hmm.
- Poor kid.

28:15.020 --> 28:18.124
Did he mention a necklace
called the blue butterfly?

28:18.125 --> 28:21.357
Oh, sure.
Asked me all kinds of questions.

28:21.358 --> 28:23.739
Uh, where it might
be, stuff like that,

28:23.740 --> 28:25.600
but I was just a
bartender back then.

28:25.601 --> 28:27.558
I-I wasn't much help.

28:27.668 --> 28:28.644
Ah.

28:29.034 --> 28:31.499
Now this might seem
an odd question,

28:31.562 --> 28:34.785
but in 1947, do you
remember when Vera Mulqueen

28:34.786 --> 28:36.296
and Joe Flynn were murdered?

28:36.297 --> 28:38.845
Of course.
It was a big deal back then.

28:39.159 --> 28:41.947
Dempsey, the fella
that owned the club,

28:41.948 --> 28:43.966
shot them in cold blood.

28:44.402 --> 28:47.840
The same year, do you remember
a woman named Sally Scofield?

28:48.531 --> 28:49.434
She was a redhead.

28:49.435 --> 28:51.905
In 1947, she would've
been about 18.

28:51.906 --> 28:54.488
Oh, I think I know who
you're talking about.

28:54.489 --> 28:56.628
Now that's back in '46.

28:56.717 --> 28:59.709
I had just got hired
at the Pennybaker.

29:06.172 --> 29:07.301
Cigarettes. Cigars.

29:07.302 --> 29:09.373
Dempsey wasn't dating
Vera back then.

29:09.876 --> 29:13.551
He was going with a gal
named Priscilla Campbell.

29:14.331 --> 29:16.001
Priscilla had a daughter,

29:16.228 --> 29:18.887
a redhead named Sally.

29:19.015 --> 29:21.031
Sounds like she's
the one you mean.

29:21.032 --> 29:23.017
Sad story, what happened.

29:23.352 --> 29:25.971
Not long after Vera
caught Dempsey's eye,

29:25.972 --> 29:29.964
he dropped Priscilla and cut
her and Sally off cold.

29:30.416 --> 29:33.912
They said it was the curse
of the blue butterfly.

29:34.067 --> 29:37.504
Priscilla killed herself
with a handful of pills.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.052
And Sally?

29:39.494 --> 29:41.485
Couple months after, uh,

29:41.526 --> 29:43.651
Vera and that PI got whacked,

29:44.876 --> 29:46.919
Dempsey died of a heart attack.

29:47.428 --> 29:48.890
The evening of his funeral,

29:48.891 --> 29:51.808
in walks Sally, all dressed up.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.512
Ordered a whiskey neat,

29:53.513 --> 29:55.385
slammed it back,

29:55.614 --> 29:58.352
gave me a big ol'
crocodile grin,

29:58.614 --> 30:00.277
said she was free.

30:01.188 --> 30:03.564
Then she strutted
on out the door,

30:03.565 --> 30:05.863
and that's the last
time I ever saw her.

30:07.818 --> 30:09.454
It's a revenge story.

30:10.291 --> 30:12.689
Sally blamed Vera for the
death of her mother,

30:12.690 --> 30:14.530
so she plotted to take her down.

30:15.042 --> 30:17.396
Somehow she used
the PI to do it.

30:17.397 --> 30:18.686
She must have been
setting them up.

30:18.687 --> 30:20.523
Yeah, but how does any of
this help us figure out

30:20.524 --> 30:21.823
who shot Stan?

30:23.677 --> 30:24.832
So...

30:24.876 --> 30:26.323
West Side Wally.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.532
May I call you Wally?

30:27.533 --> 30:28.978
I prefer West Side.

30:28.985 --> 30:29.894
Of course.

30:29.895 --> 30:32.431
West Side, we know you were
at the Pennybaker Club

30:32.432 --> 30:34.256
- two days ago.
- Yeah, we found your squat.

30:34.257 --> 30:36.671
Whoa. Cagney and Lacey,
you can stop right there.

30:36.672 --> 30:38.582
I wasn't living in the
club two days ago.

30:38.583 --> 30:40.305
I had already gotten bought
out by the other guy.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.817
- Bought out?
- By the other guy?

30:41.818 --> 30:43.036
A few days ago, the
other guy comes in,

30:43.037 --> 30:44.540
starts setting up a
squat by the bar,

30:44.541 --> 30:46.086
but West Side Wally
doesn't do neighbors.

30:46.087 --> 30:48.353
So I said, "Hey,
professor, kick rocks."

30:48.433 --> 30:49.872
He wouldn't take
no for an answer.

30:49.873 --> 30:52.279
Ended up paying me
$400 to relocate.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.171
So again, for the record
this time, I wasn't there.

30:54.172 --> 30:56.641
Easy, easy, okay.
Did you get this guy's name?

30:56.642 --> 30:58.174
I didn't ask. He didn't say.

30:58.216 --> 30:59.002
Can you describe him?

30:59.003 --> 31:01.170
Medium height, medium
build, white, 50s.

31:01.171 --> 31:02.841
I called him the professor

31:02.842 --> 31:05.378
because he spoke like
a pretentious jerk.

31:10.511 --> 31:12.691
Hey, it's the professor.

31:12.926 --> 31:14.290
Clyde Belasco.

31:21.637 --> 31:24.453
We know that you were
at the Pennybaker Club,

31:24.454 --> 31:25.295
Mr. Belasco.

31:25.296 --> 31:26.913
You paid off a homeless man

31:26.914 --> 31:29.617
so that you could have
the place to yourself.

31:30.494 --> 31:32.498
I have a condo on the
Upper East Side,

31:32.499 --> 31:33.970
a chateau in Bordeaux,

31:33.971 --> 31:35.934
a chalet in Gstaad, and yet,

31:35.935 --> 31:37.188
on the word of some vagrant,

31:37.189 --> 31:40.792
you believe that I paid to squat
in an abandoned building?

31:40.793 --> 31:43.339
Me? Clyde Belasco?

31:43.340 --> 31:44.480
Pretty much.

31:45.352 --> 31:47.242
I'd like to see you
prove it, sir.

31:49.155 --> 31:50.949
All right, have it
your way, professor.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.654
We will see you at the
sentencing hearing.

31:53.804 --> 31:56.251
You can do your TV
show from prison.

31:57.553 --> 31:58.606
Wait.

31:59.306 --> 32:00.379
Okay.

32:00.759 --> 32:01.876
I was there. I admit it.

32:01.877 --> 32:04.652
I was at the Pennybaker
Club when Stan was killed.

32:04.653 --> 32:06.134
But I didn't kill him.

32:06.143 --> 32:08.954
Like I said before,
Stan came to me

32:08.955 --> 32:10.726
and asked for my research

32:10.727 --> 32:12.554
on the blue butterfly.

32:12.818 --> 32:13.993
And you said no?

32:13.994 --> 32:15.644
Of course I said no.

32:15.653 --> 32:17.907
I searched for that
necklace for 15 years,

32:17.908 --> 32:19.899
and now I'm just
supposed to help him?

32:19.900 --> 32:21.715
The glory was to be mine.

32:21.822 --> 32:23.790
But you knew he was on to
something, didn't you?

32:23.791 --> 32:24.762
Oh, yes.

32:25.155 --> 32:27.353
I could tell he was
close, so very close.

32:27.354 --> 32:29.227
Stan knew things about the
club, about the necklace

32:29.228 --> 32:31.015
that I had never heard before.

32:31.016 --> 32:33.137
So you staked out the club,
and when Stan showed,

32:33.138 --> 32:33.738
you shot him.

32:33.739 --> 32:35.955
I didn't shoot him, detective.

32:35.956 --> 32:37.826
Yes, I had a pistol with me

32:37.827 --> 32:38.674
and a bullwhip.

32:38.675 --> 32:40.823
They're my trademarks.
Everyone knows that.

32:41.131 --> 32:42.703
But I brought a mask
and gloves as well

32:42.704 --> 32:44.399
because I was simply
going to threaten him

32:44.400 --> 32:45.756
and take the prize.

32:45.757 --> 32:47.266
So then what happened?

32:48.649 --> 32:50.211
I was lying in wait.

32:50.606 --> 32:53.218
Stan went downstairs, and
when he returned, he was...

32:53.219 --> 32:55.255
holding the blue butterfly.

32:56.553 --> 32:59.090
Oh, you should've
seen how it sparkled.

32:59.659 --> 33:00.965
Magnificent.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.313
I was about to pounce
when suddenly there was

33:03.314 --> 33:04.744
a-a rag put over my mouth.

33:04.745 --> 33:06.679
It had a sweet smell,

33:06.680 --> 33:09.173
like it was doused
with chloroform.

33:09.299 --> 33:10.602
Chloroform?

33:11.197 --> 33:12.841
- Really?
- It had to be.

33:12.861 --> 33:15.093
Everything went dark,
and when I came to,

33:15.094 --> 33:16.662
Stan was dead.

33:16.663 --> 33:19.521
I searched his body, but
whoever knocked me out

33:19.522 --> 33:22.087
took the blue
butterfly with them.

33:25.154 --> 33:26.058
God, I hope it's him.

33:26.059 --> 33:27.120
Yeah, but without a confession,

33:27.121 --> 33:29.435
our case is purely
circumstantial.

33:29.436 --> 33:32.045
I'm gonna see if I can get a
warrant for Belasco's place.

33:32.046 --> 33:35.078
Which place, the condo, the
chateau, or the chalet?

33:35.616 --> 33:37.175
Hi, yeah, this is
detective Kate Beckett,

33:37.176 --> 33:37.774
12th precinct.

33:37.775 --> 33:39.824
I'm calling for the riding ADA.

33:40.772 --> 33:41.532
Mm-hmm.

33:41.533 --> 33:43.059
Yeah. Okay. I'll hold.

33:43.584 --> 33:45.199
Well, it's kind
of disappointing.

33:45.428 --> 33:47.336
I was really hoping that
solving Stan's murder

33:47.337 --> 33:48.497
would give us some answers

33:48.498 --> 33:50.008
to what really happened
to Joe and Vera.

33:50.009 --> 33:51.808
Yeah, but what we already
know what really happened.

33:51.809 --> 33:53.252
Dempsey killed them both.

33:53.289 --> 33:56.447
Well, that's the obvious version.
But what about Sally?

33:56.626 --> 33:59.198
What's her part in all of this?
And...

33:59.935 --> 34:01.415
why would she hire Joe?

34:02.076 --> 34:03.460
Well, I guess we'll never know.

34:03.585 --> 34:05.573
No, something else was going on.

34:05.574 --> 34:06.972
Something we're missing.

34:07.530 --> 34:10.821
"Wearing t-strap shoes
and a country suit,

34:10.822 --> 34:13.261
I could tell that redhead
was a hick off the cob."

34:13.262 --> 34:14.742
Wait. What did you just say?

34:14.743 --> 34:17.411
Well, that's just how Joe
described her in his diary.

34:17.411 --> 34:19.327
No, the--the part
about the shoes?

34:19.328 --> 34:21.585
T-strap. It's when the
strap comes over the--

34:21.587 --> 34:24.062
Yeah. Can I just call you back?

34:24.831 --> 34:25.797
Okay.

34:27.161 --> 34:28.463
Take a look at this photo.

34:28.464 --> 34:30.174
There's a shoe next to the car.

34:30.175 --> 34:31.813
And look at what
kind of shoe it is.

34:32.831 --> 34:34.295
That's a t-strap.

34:34.502 --> 34:35.179
You don't think...

34:35.181 --> 34:36.695
If Vera was at the
club that night,

34:36.696 --> 34:38.560
she'd be dressed in an
elegant dress and...

34:38.561 --> 34:40.652
And heels. This isn't Vera.

34:40.654 --> 34:41.808
This is Sally.

34:41.809 --> 34:42.777
Yeah, but it can't be Sally.

34:42.779 --> 34:45.827
The bartender said that he saw
her months after the murders.

34:46.032 --> 34:46.774
Unless...

34:46.804 --> 34:47.838
- he lied.
- He lied.

34:47.839 --> 34:49.239
But that was over
half a century ago.

34:49.241 --> 34:50.496
Why would he lie about that?

34:50.496 --> 34:52.650
- Beckett, I just realized something.
- Huh?

34:52.652 --> 34:54.454
"I can't give you
anything but love."

34:55.810 --> 34:56.404
W-what?

34:56.405 --> 34:59.184
That's what was playing when
we interviewed the bartender.

34:59.203 --> 35:00.525
Right. Right.

35:00.526 --> 35:03.799
He said that that was the
best version of the song.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.904
It was Louis
Armstrong's version.

35:05.905 --> 35:08.828
In Joe's diary, he says his
favorite performer is Satchmo.

35:08.829 --> 35:10.356
What's Satchmo's real name?

35:10.538 --> 35:11.353
Louis Armstrong.

35:11.354 --> 35:12.770
Put it all together,

35:13.000 --> 35:14.316
the answer is clear.

35:17.863 --> 35:20.013
Oh. Hello again.

35:20.224 --> 35:21.330
Hello, Vera.

35:23.307 --> 35:24.683
And hello, Joe.

35:32.876 --> 35:35.661
Well, if it isn't Vera Mulqueen

35:35.662 --> 35:38.814
and Joe Flynn, back
from the dead.

35:38.815 --> 35:40.232
Everything all right, guys?

35:40.233 --> 35:43.052
Everything's peachy.
Thanks, Frankie.

35:43.053 --> 35:46.132
What happened?
Stan figured out the truth,

35:46.397 --> 35:48.007
that you two were alive,

35:48.008 --> 35:49.459
that you murdered two people

35:49.460 --> 35:51.602
so you could disappear
with the blue butterfly?

35:51.603 --> 35:54.039
So you lured him to the
club and then you shot him?

35:54.040 --> 35:55.787
Lady, you got it all wrong.

35:56.335 --> 35:58.082
Stan cornered me at
Betsy's funeral,

35:58.083 --> 35:59.767
wanting to know how I knew her.

35:59.768 --> 36:02.949
So I lied and told him
I was a bartender.

36:03.232 --> 36:05.442
But Stan was clever.
He was too clever.

36:05.443 --> 36:06.450
He figured us out.

36:06.451 --> 36:09.737
He came here demanding to know
where the blue butterfly was.

36:09.738 --> 36:11.798
He threatened to expose us.

36:12.054 --> 36:13.852
He was like a dog after a bone.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.355
So we told him what
he needed to know.

36:16.418 --> 36:17.918
We told him where it was.

36:18.625 --> 36:20.096
But we didn't kill him.

36:20.239 --> 36:21.351
Oh, come on, you guys.

36:21.352 --> 36:22.252
We know it's you.

36:22.253 --> 36:25.228
You used the same gun from the
'47 murders to kill Stan.

36:25.229 --> 36:27.758
Same gun?
Oh, we keep that gun in the--

36:27.759 --> 36:29.295
The China cabinet drawer.

36:30.162 --> 36:31.747
Don't even think about it.

36:32.506 --> 36:33.754
Put the gun down.

36:35.506 --> 36:37.836
Francis Benjamin Huntsacker,

36:37.837 --> 36:39.118
what have you done?

36:39.119 --> 36:40.513
Wait a minute. Huntsacker?

36:41.662 --> 36:43.918
It was your mother who
sold the diary to Stan.

36:44.354 --> 36:45.028
What diary?

36:45.029 --> 36:46.126
Your diary.

36:46.393 --> 36:47.688
So you read it,

36:47.728 --> 36:49.823
and all this time, you were
looking for the necklace, too.

36:49.824 --> 36:51.905
That's why I got this crap job.

36:51.906 --> 36:54.103
And for six months,
I slowly built trust,

36:54.104 --> 36:55.428
gently acquired information.

36:55.429 --> 36:57.335
And then that jerk
just waltzes in here

36:57.336 --> 36:59.261
and bullies the location of
the blue butterfly from you?

36:59.262 --> 37:00.158
Come on!

37:00.159 --> 37:02.252
So when you realized
it was now or never,

37:02.253 --> 37:04.258
you bushwhacked Stan,

37:04.259 --> 37:05.927
took the blue butterfly
for yourself?

37:05.928 --> 37:08.207
I brought their old
.38 only as a precaution.

37:08.208 --> 37:10.109
I was just gonna chloroform
Stan and steal it.

37:10.110 --> 37:12.742
But you found Clyde Belasco
hiding behind the bar.

37:12.743 --> 37:15.328
I pulled the gun, Stan
grabbed for it...

37:16.245 --> 37:17.521
Look, I didn't mean to.

37:18.539 --> 37:20.685
Let's go, Frankie.
You're under arrest.

37:27.301 --> 37:29.160
Hey, Castle, guess what we found

37:29.161 --> 37:31.143
at Frankie's apartment.

37:35.974 --> 37:37.303
Oh, my.

37:37.741 --> 37:39.257
Oh, my God.

37:41.099 --> 37:42.428
It's beautiful.

37:43.474 --> 37:44.986
- It's fake.
- What?

37:44.987 --> 37:46.407
We confirmed it
with an appraiser.

37:46.408 --> 37:48.450
It's well-crafted
costume jewelry.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.037
All this time, and it's paste?

37:51.636 --> 37:52.636
That's...

37:53.390 --> 37:55.128
Or maybe it's a
twist on a twist.

37:55.129 --> 37:56.218
Maybe the real blue butterfly

37:56.219 --> 37:57.839
was switched out for
this one years ago.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.771
Well, whatever happened, it
doesn't change the facts.

37:59.772 --> 38:02.289
We still have one
more case to close.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.461
Okay, so now we know

38:06.462 --> 38:07.993
that Frankie killed Stan,

38:07.994 --> 38:11.170
but there are still two murders
that need to be solved--

38:11.171 --> 38:14.674
Sally Campbell and whoever
else you put in that car.

38:14.675 --> 38:16.926
It's time you come
clean on what happened

38:16.927 --> 38:19.798
the evening of June 24, 1947,

38:19.992 --> 38:21.631
the night you disappeared.

38:23.682 --> 38:24.825
Tell them, Vera.

38:24.944 --> 38:27.890
We were all huddled around
the, uh, radio, listening to

38:27.891 --> 38:31.603
the Sugar Ray Robinson/
Jimmy Doyle prizefight, and, uh,

38:31.684 --> 38:33.891
I was building up nerve
to make my escape.

38:33.892 --> 38:35.241
Breaks up the clinch.

38:35.617 --> 38:38.813
A slowly tiring Jimmy Doyle
throws a left, another left.

38:38.814 --> 38:41.348
Here comes Robinson.

38:41.349 --> 38:44.010
A left. A right. Another left...

38:44.011 --> 38:45.949
Moxie, I need to powder my nose.

38:45.950 --> 38:47.804
Are you kidding me? Can it wait?

38:47.805 --> 38:48.730
No.

38:49.126 --> 38:50.739
Ah, what do you say, boss?

38:52.093 --> 38:53.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, make it quick.

38:53.751 --> 38:55.477
Robinson regroups.

38:56.719 --> 38:59.376
Robinson delivers a left,
a right, a left again.

38:59.377 --> 39:01.960
Doyle punches back, but
missed him by a mile.

39:08.348 --> 39:10.063
Well, aren't you a picture?

39:11.118 --> 39:11.914
Who are you?

39:11.915 --> 39:13.017
I'm with her.

39:13.632 --> 39:14.435
Put 'em up.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.497
The guy was Sally's husband.

39:16.498 --> 39:18.961
She'd only hired Joe to
get me away from Dempsey

39:18.962 --> 39:21.231
so she could exact her revenge.

39:21.232 --> 39:23.483
Now you're gonna suffer, Vera,
like my mother suffered.

39:23.484 --> 39:26.222
Wait, Sal.
Let me get the ice first.

39:28.835 --> 39:29.900
No!

39:30.171 --> 39:31.328
Lenny!

39:32.098 --> 39:33.815
Ugh! What are you doing?

39:33.835 --> 39:35.137
Give me the gun!

39:39.582 --> 39:40.723
Oh!

39:40.770 --> 39:42.614
Oh! Joe!

39:42.615 --> 39:43.520
We were hot as a pistol

39:43.521 --> 39:45.744
and--and we had two
bodies on our hands,

39:45.745 --> 39:47.350
and we had to do something.

39:49.113 --> 39:50.164
And Joe...

39:50.805 --> 39:52.036
had the plan.

39:59.380 --> 40:01.436
No one would be looking
for those two.

40:02.744 --> 40:04.557
We needed to disappear.

40:14.826 --> 40:16.775
Obviously, we didn't

40:16.776 --> 40:18.459
disappear far enough.

40:19.933 --> 40:21.042
So...

40:22.001 --> 40:24.082
are you going to arrest us?

40:32.690 --> 40:33.948
Why would I do that?

40:34.134 --> 40:35.723
Sounds like self-defense.

40:35.761 --> 40:36.562
Besides...

40:36.563 --> 40:38.518
we're looking for a
woman named Vera,

40:38.519 --> 40:39.609
not Viola,

40:40.279 --> 40:42.128
and a PI named Joe,

40:42.270 --> 40:44.672
not a former bartender
named Jerry.

40:45.456 --> 40:47.364
We don't know how to thank you.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.058
I do.

40:51.314 --> 40:52.788
Answer two questions.

40:54.257 --> 40:55.322
One...

40:55.849 --> 40:58.395
if you had the blue butterfly,
why didn't you take it?

40:59.006 --> 41:00.211
And two...

41:01.058 --> 41:02.794
where has it been all this time?

41:02.795 --> 41:05.014
Well, we were home free
till doll face here

41:05.015 --> 41:06.746
had herself an epiphany.

41:07.420 --> 41:09.437
This thing really is cursed.

41:09.438 --> 41:11.404
Vera, that's just fancy
rocks on a pretty rope.

41:11.405 --> 41:13.259
No, it's more than that.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.492
It's misery. Joe, we can't.

41:16.589 --> 41:17.988
I got no love for this thing,

41:18.316 --> 41:19.304
just you.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.312
But I'll be damned

41:20.313 --> 41:22.517
if I let Dempsey get
his hands back on it.

41:39.637 --> 41:41.078
Let the bastard spend
the rest of his life

41:41.079 --> 41:44.027
not knowing his prize possession
is right under his nose.

41:51.346 --> 41:53.826
Cursed or not, did you ever
consider going back for it?

41:54.763 --> 41:56.764
They don't get it, Joe.

41:57.090 --> 41:58.559
Mm. I...

41:58.560 --> 42:00.367
We got four children,

42:00.368 --> 42:02.027
seven grandchildren,

42:02.028 --> 42:03.689
two great-grandchildren...

42:04.847 --> 42:05.488
and each other.

42:05.489 --> 42:06.804
Mm-hmm.

42:07.985 --> 42:10.164
What do we need a
blue butterfly for?

42:15.525 --> 42:17.295
Do you think we should've
told Joe and Vera

42:17.296 --> 42:18.772
about the blue butterfly?

42:18.773 --> 42:20.880
Oh, no. Why ruin it for them?

42:21.308 --> 42:23.348
No, that's the stuff
that dreams are made of.

42:27.597 --> 42:29.002
Tell me you love me, Joe.

42:29.214 --> 42:30.210
Always.
