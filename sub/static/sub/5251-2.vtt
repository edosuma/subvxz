WEBVTT

00:08.042 --> 00:09.043
>> RONDA: You know, you look

00:09.043 --> 00:10.044
really good today.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.045
Can I take a picture?

00:11.045 --> 00:12.046
(chuckles)

00:12.046 --> 00:13.047
>> CAITLYN: Let's see it.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.048
>> RONDA: Stop.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.049
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.050
>> RONDA: Oh. Oh, I video'd you

00:16.050 --> 00:17.051
by accident-- you want to see?

00:17.051 --> 00:18.052
(over phone): Hold on. I'm not

00:18.052 --> 00:18.819
really good with this phone.

00:18.819 --> 00:19.520
>> COURTNEY: Do your favorite

00:19.520 --> 00:20.521
pose.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.289
>> RONDA: I hate my voice.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.056
>> COURTNEY: Oh, I hate mine.

00:22.056 --> 00:22.723
I just hate it.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.791
>> RONDA: I want to show you how

00:23.791 --> 00:24.458
pretty you are.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.393
>> CAITLYN: I don't look good in

00:25.393 --> 00:26.394
pictures.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.061
>> RONDA: Yes, you do.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.062
>> CAITLYN: Unless it's Annie

00:28.062 --> 00:29.063
Leibovitz.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.064
The only thing that bothers me

00:30.064 --> 00:31.065
about that, I really haven't

00:31.065 --> 00:33.000
heard my voice, you know?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.936
And any trans person, the voice

00:35.936 --> 00:37.405
is always, like...

00:37.405 --> 00:39.240
>> RONDA: What do you mean?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.441
>> CAITLYN: ...you know, scary.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.509
Well, you-you obviously don't

00:41.509 --> 00:42.643
have the feminine voice, and

00:42.643 --> 00:43.744
that kind of bothers you.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.745
>> COURTNEY: There's a voice

00:44.745 --> 00:46.114
coach app.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.115
>> CAITLYN: Oh, okay.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.116
>> COURTNEY: And it tests your

00:48.116 --> 00:49.250
pitch and you can practice.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.251
So you're gonna say the word

00:50.251 --> 00:51.652
"he" over and over.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.686
>> CAITLYN: What is it?

00:52.686 --> 00:54.021
>> COURTNEY: "He." H-E.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.022
>> CAITLYN: Oh, "he."

00:55.022 --> 00:56.357
Eh...

00:56.357 --> 00:57.991
Just normally? Sorry.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.059
Just-just say it normally?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.261
>> COURTNEY: Yeah. Yeah, however

01:00.261 --> 01:01.395
you want to say it.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.596
>> RONDA: You need a lesson.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.597
>> CAITLYN (cracking): He.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.133
(laughing)

01:05.133 --> 01:06.134
>> RONDA: Cracking the voice.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.135
(laughs)

01:07.135 --> 01:08.136
>> CAITLYN: I got to do it

01:08.136 --> 01:09.137
again.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.804
Wait a second.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.674
(high-pitched): He, he, he, he.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.675
One thing that's always a

01:14.675 --> 01:16.177
challenge for anybody is your

01:16.177 --> 01:17.545
voice.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.947
That can out you every time.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.349
You know? You look great, you

01:21.349 --> 01:22.816
look fabulous, and...

01:22.816 --> 01:23.851
(deeply): then you open up your

01:23.851 --> 01:26.053
voice, you know?

01:26.053 --> 01:27.455
And everybody goes...

01:27.455 --> 01:28.689
(gasps) "Oh, my God."

01:28.689 --> 01:31.392
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.793
>> COURTNEY: 70%.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.061
>> CAITLYN: My voice has never

01:34.061 --> 01:36.930
been terribly bad, but it's-it's

01:36.930 --> 01:38.432
certainly not quite right.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.001
He...

01:41.001 --> 01:42.503
>> ALL: He...

01:42.503 --> 01:44.472
(laughing)

01:46.940 --> 01:48.909
*

01:56.016 --> 01:58.252
(birds chirping)

01:58.252 --> 01:59.687
(doorbell rings)

01:59.687 --> 02:00.754
(door opens)

02:00.754 --> 02:01.755
>> KIM: Look at you.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.023
>> CAITLYN: My Kimmy's here.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.091
>> KIM: Look at you.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.193
Are we wearing the same tank?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.727
Hmm.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.728
>> CAITLYN: I think so.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.962
Hello, baby, I haven't seen

02:08.962 --> 02:10.731
little Malika in a while.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.032
>> MALIKA: A while.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.033
>> CAITLYN: How are you doing?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.034
>> MALIKA: Good. How are you?

02:14.034 --> 02:15.503
I love your eyes.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.537
>> CAITLYN: Have a seat.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.772
Um, talking about looks,

02:18.772 --> 02:20.040
honestly, this girl thing is a

02:20.040 --> 02:21.041
lot of work.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.042
>> MALIKA: Yeah, it is.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.043
>> CAITLYN: Yes, it is.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.778
Do you have any feminine tips?

02:24.778 --> 02:25.779
Here we have two very feminine

02:25.779 --> 02:26.914
women.

02:26.914 --> 02:27.981
>> MALIKA: Men and women eat

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
very different.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.251
As a woman, you have to be very

02:30.251 --> 02:31.752
mindful.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.254
Like, I'm not saying you can

02:33.254 --> 02:34.855
never touch a rib again, but,

02:34.855 --> 02:35.856
like, the way you eat...

02:35.856 --> 02:36.857
>> CAITLYN: Touch the rib in the

02:36.857 --> 02:37.858
privacy of your-your own room or

02:37.858 --> 02:38.859
anything, yeah.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.860
>> MALIKA: Just some things, you

02:39.860 --> 02:40.861
know?

02:40.861 --> 02:41.862
Exactly.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.863
>> CAITLYN: But, actually,

02:42.863 --> 02:43.864
that's a good tip.

02:43.864 --> 02:44.865
>> MALIKA: How are you clearing

02:44.865 --> 02:45.866
the... You... Okay, you don't

02:45.866 --> 02:46.867
have on heels.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.236
I was gonna say, if you're gonna

02:48.236 --> 02:49.903
clear this doorway, you know...

02:49.903 --> 02:50.904
>> CAITLYN: Oh, just because

02:50.904 --> 02:52.506
you're-you're so short and you

02:52.506 --> 02:54.508
got to wear massive heels...

02:54.508 --> 02:55.509
>> MALIKA: No, but it's just

02:55.509 --> 02:56.844
like you can't bend all the way

02:56.844 --> 02:57.545
to the side.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.246
>> CAITLYN: Oh, please, look,

02:58.246 --> 02:58.912
plenty of clearance, girl.

02:58.912 --> 02:59.847
Look at this. Look at this.

02:59.847 --> 03:00.681
>> MALIKA: I was just telling

03:00.681 --> 03:01.449
her, she can't do that.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.115
Like, it's not...

03:02.115 --> 03:02.783
That's fi...

03:02.783 --> 03:03.717
But when you have heels on...

03:03.717 --> 03:04.385
>> CAITLYN: Not even close.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.052
Not even close.

03:05.052 --> 03:05.819
>> MALIKA: When she wears heels

03:05.819 --> 03:06.754
and they're, like, four or five

03:06.754 --> 03:07.755
inches...

03:07.755 --> 03:08.556
>> CAITLYN: Don't be jealous of

03:08.556 --> 03:09.623
my height and start to put me

03:09.623 --> 03:10.624
down.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.625
>> MALIKA: I'm completely

03:11.625 --> 03:13.261
jealous of your height.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.728
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.497
Being feminine, you got to kind

03:16.497 --> 03:18.266
of learn everything.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.967
Jenny Boylan did a book on her

03:19.967 --> 03:21.335
transition, and she had a

03:21.335 --> 03:23.704
statement in there and I... just

03:23.704 --> 03:24.738
I loved it.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.873
And she says, "I never felt

03:25.873 --> 03:29.109
feminine, but I always felt

03:29.109 --> 03:32.713
female."

03:32.713 --> 03:34.282
And I'm, "Ah."

03:34.282 --> 03:35.616
That kind of hits the nail on

03:35.616 --> 03:36.617
the head for me.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.018
>> KIM: Like, you never felt

03:38.018 --> 03:39.287
feminine 'cause you're a tomboy.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.288
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, but I always

03:40.288 --> 03:42.022
felt female.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.090
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.091
>> CAITLYN: But for so many

03:44.091 --> 03:46.126
years, um, you depress all of

03:46.126 --> 03:47.127
that.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.462
All I want to do is just kind of

03:48.462 --> 03:50.564
slip into society.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.000
One thing that I really need to

03:53.000 --> 03:55.869
work on is kind of that voice.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.870
>> KIM: Well, at least your

03:56.870 --> 03:57.871
voice isn't that deep, so it's

03:57.871 --> 03:58.872
not like you're...

03:58.872 --> 03:59.873
(deeply): "Hello."

03:59.873 --> 04:00.941
>> CAITLYN: No, it's not that

04:00.941 --> 04:02.209
deep, and I... it's okay.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.210
>> KIM: What about vocal

04:03.210 --> 04:04.211
lessons?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.212
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, you may be

04:05.212 --> 04:06.814
able to, I think, with some

04:06.814 --> 04:07.815
training, 'cause a lot of people

04:07.815 --> 04:08.816
go through training.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.552
In fact, um, I want to show you.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.553
Here we go.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.554
>> WOMAN (deeply): When the

04:13.554 --> 04:14.755
sunlight strikes raindrops in

04:14.755 --> 04:16.390
the air, they act as a prism...

04:16.390 --> 04:17.425
>> CAITLYN: That's before.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.759
>> WOMAN: The rainbow is a

04:18.759 --> 04:19.960
division of white light into

04:19.960 --> 04:21.462
many beautiful colors.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.996
(high-pitched): Rainbow passage.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.097
When the sunlight strikes

04:24.097 --> 04:25.466
raindrops in the air, they act

04:25.466 --> 04:26.567
as a prism and form a rainbow.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.568
>> KIM: Wow.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.569
>> WOMAN: The rainbow is a

04:28.569 --> 04:29.570
division of white light into

04:29.570 --> 04:30.571
many beautiful colors.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.572
>> MALIKA: That's a big

04:31.572 --> 04:32.573
difference.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.574
>> CAITLYN: That is a huge

04:33.574 --> 04:34.575
difference.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.576
>> KIM: Just, like, try out some

04:35.576 --> 04:36.710
voices, like, that are just a

04:36.710 --> 04:37.711
little lighter.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.712
Have you ever tried, or is it

04:38.712 --> 04:39.713
gonna be too much work if you're

04:39.713 --> 04:40.714
like...

04:40.714 --> 04:41.715
(high-pitched): "Hi."

04:41.715 --> 04:42.783
>> CAITLYN: I used to, for

04:42.783 --> 04:44.452
years, like, if you called down

04:44.452 --> 04:46.987
for room service, okay, okay,

04:46.987 --> 04:48.789
I'd be sitting there in my room,

04:48.789 --> 04:50.190
all by my little lonesome, and

04:50.190 --> 04:51.492
I'd think, "Okay, now, I'm gonna

04:51.492 --> 04:53.126
try to get my best feminine

04:53.126 --> 04:54.728
voice and call down so they say,

04:54.728 --> 04:56.430
'Yes, ma'am.'"

04:56.430 --> 04:57.431
I could never do it.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.432
>> KIM: Like, go... Okay, try.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.433
Let's hear.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.501
>> CAITLYN: What?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.502
>> KIM: Let's hear... Yeah.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.503
I'll tell you if you get a "yes,

05:02.503 --> 05:03.771
ma'am."

05:03.771 --> 05:05.038
>> CAITLYN: Well...

05:05.038 --> 05:06.173
(chuckles)

05:06.173 --> 05:07.174
>> KIM: Front desk.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.376
Hey, this is room service.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.577
How can I help you?

05:09.577 --> 05:10.944
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

05:10.944 --> 05:14.482
Um...

05:14.482 --> 05:15.583
>> KIM: Order bacon and eggs.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.584
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.585
>> KIM: And an orange juice.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.752
And toast.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.888
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Um...

05:20.888 --> 05:22.289
Yes, actually, you can help me.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.391
Um...

05:23.391 --> 05:24.692
>> KIM: You sound no different!

05:24.692 --> 05:25.693
>> CAITLYN: I didn't think so.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.694
>> KIM: No. Sir, sir, what would

05:26.694 --> 05:27.695
you like, sir?

05:27.695 --> 05:28.696
>> CAITLYN: Sir, yeah, what

05:28.696 --> 05:29.697
would you like?

05:29.697 --> 05:32.666
Yeah. See, that's the problem.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.267
Women cannot relate to the whole

05:34.267 --> 05:35.403
voice thing.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.837
They don't see it as being that

05:36.837 --> 05:38.872
important when it is that

05:38.872 --> 05:41.575
important, not only for you just

05:41.575 --> 05:43.644
to speak and order and do all

05:43.644 --> 05:44.878
that kind of stuff but very

05:44.878 --> 05:46.714
important for your soul that

05:46.714 --> 05:48.816
you're feeling good about that.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.184
There are things that you can do

05:51.184 --> 05:53.186
to change your pitch.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.924
>> KIM: Really? Like what?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.892
>> CAITLYN: Surgery.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.696
>> MALIKA: Why surgery?

06:02.696 --> 06:03.697
>> CAITLYN: Well, I was thinking

06:03.697 --> 06:04.698
about starting there...

06:04.698 --> 06:05.699
>> KIM: Surgery would scare the

06:05.699 --> 06:06.700
(bleep) out of me.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.701
>> MALIKA: What if you had no

06:07.701 --> 06:08.702
voice at all?

06:08.702 --> 06:09.703
>> KIM: What if they made a

06:09.703 --> 06:10.871
mistake and you, like, came out

06:10.871 --> 06:12.840
with no voice?

06:19.813 --> 06:23.016
(gulls crying)

06:23.016 --> 06:24.017
>> PRODUCER: What's different

06:24.017 --> 06:25.453
about tonight's girls' night?

06:25.453 --> 06:26.454
'Cause you've been doing girls'

06:26.454 --> 06:27.455
nights for a while, right?

06:27.455 --> 06:28.456
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. You know, for

06:28.456 --> 06:29.457
a long time, I've been doing...

06:29.457 --> 06:30.458
having all the girls over.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.459
But tonight we have all trans

06:31.459 --> 06:32.460
girls.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.461
>> JENNY: Hello.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.462
>> COURTNEY: Hi.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.463
>> JENNY: I'm looking for the

06:35.463 --> 06:36.464
lady of the house.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.465
>> RONDA: Jennifer's here.

06:37.465 --> 06:38.466
>> CAITLYN: Right here.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.467
>> COURTNEY: There she is.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.468
>> JENNY: Hi, darling.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.469
>> CAITLYN: Hey, baby.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.636
Are you ready for this?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.804
>> JENNY: I am so ready.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.205
I'm Jennifer Finney Boylan.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.574
Caitlyn and I met when she was

06:46.574 --> 06:48.141
doing the Diane Sawyer special.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.643
I'm an author and I'm a

06:49.643 --> 06:51.278
professor at Barnard College in

06:51.278 --> 06:52.279
New York City.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.281
I'm also the co-chair of GLAAD,

06:54.281 --> 06:56.383
the LGBT advocacy organization.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.486
I'm a transgender woman, and

06:58.486 --> 07:00.253
I've been married to my wife for

07:00.253 --> 07:03.857
27 years, 12 as husband and wife

07:03.857 --> 07:04.858
and 15 as wife and wife.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.859
>> CAITLYN: We're gonna do a

07:05.859 --> 07:06.860
little glam.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.861
>> COURTNEY: What are you

07:07.861 --> 07:08.862
thinking?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.030
Like, what's your favorite way

07:10.030 --> 07:12.032
to wear your hair that you love?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.033
>> JENNY: Kind of like... kind

07:13.033 --> 07:14.034
of like this.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.202
As befits the dignity of my

07:15.202 --> 07:16.203
station.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.204
Do you have any idea what I'm

07:17.204 --> 07:18.205
talking about?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.206
>> CAITLYN: I would be scared to

07:19.206 --> 07:20.207
death to take your class.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.208
>> JENNY: Oh, no, no, no, no,

07:21.208 --> 07:22.209
no.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.210
>> CAITLYN: I would be.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.211
>> JENNY: We couldn't come from

07:24.211 --> 07:25.513
more different worlds, you know?

07:25.513 --> 07:27.515
I am this New England academic,

07:27.515 --> 07:29.550
and, you know, she lives here in

07:29.550 --> 07:30.584
Malibu.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.819
It's kind of freaky that we got

07:31.819 --> 07:33.020
to be friends at all, but here

07:33.020 --> 07:34.021
we are.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.022
>> CAITLYN: Jenny, this is

07:35.022 --> 07:36.023
looking so good.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.024
>> JENNY: I can feel my IQ

07:37.024 --> 07:38.025
plummeting.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.159
(laughter)

07:39.159 --> 07:40.160
>> CAITLYN: Oh, no!

07:40.160 --> 07:41.161
>> COURTNEY: No!

07:41.161 --> 07:42.162
>> CAITLYN: You didn't just say

07:42.162 --> 07:43.163
that!

07:43.163 --> 07:44.164
>> JENNY: It's just a joke.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.165
Everyone relax.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.166
>> CAITLYN: What size are you?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.167
I have something in the closet I

07:47.167 --> 07:48.168
want you to wear.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.169
It's just a wraparound.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.170
>> JENNY: Oh, I think it's too

07:50.170 --> 07:51.171
formal.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.172
>> CAITLYN: Try it on.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.173
We'll leave you in here.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.174
Try it on.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.175
>> JENNY: Wait, what was that

07:55.175 --> 07:56.176
look?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.244
My paws and whiskers.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.245
Did you just give me a look?

07:58.245 --> 07:59.246
You just gave me a freaking

07:59.246 --> 08:00.247
look.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.314
>> CAITLYN: If you want to go

08:01.314 --> 08:02.315
with a great skirt...

08:02.315 --> 08:03.316
>> JENNY: (sighs) Well, I could

08:03.316 --> 08:05.318
try it on.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.920
For Caitlyn, being pretty, being

08:06.920 --> 08:08.321
beautiful, caring about clothes

08:08.321 --> 08:10.691
and makeup is really important.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.992
But there are more important

08:11.992 --> 08:12.993
things than what you look like.

08:12.993 --> 08:13.994
>> CAITLYN: Oh, you even got the

08:13.994 --> 08:14.995
purse!

08:14.995 --> 08:15.996
>> JENNY: I got your purse.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.997
>> CAITLYN: Look how cute and

08:16.997 --> 08:18.599
adorable you look.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.800
>> JENNY: She has the problem of

08:19.800 --> 08:21.635
not knowing the community really

08:21.635 --> 08:22.636
well.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.071
She's a stranger in some ways to

08:24.071 --> 08:25.372
the community.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.574
Now, let me ask you this.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.875
Nervous?

08:27.875 --> 08:29.442
>> CAITLYN: Off the charts.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.311
But pressure's good, something

08:31.311 --> 08:32.613
that's very positive to me.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.381
Pressure makes me think.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.716
>> JENNY: I invited a diverse

08:35.716 --> 08:37.117
group of transgender women for

08:37.117 --> 08:38.586
Cait to meet and get a sense of

08:38.586 --> 08:39.820
our community.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.590
However, Caitlyn is a person of

08:42.590 --> 08:44.391
tremendous privilege and power.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.626
I'm a little afraid about what's

08:45.626 --> 08:46.627
going to happen when she meets a

08:46.627 --> 08:48.295
lot of transgender people

08:48.295 --> 08:49.329
who-who don't have the privilege

08:49.329 --> 08:50.330
that-that she has had.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.331
(doorbell rings)

08:51.331 --> 08:52.332
>> CAITLYN: And here they come.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.333
>> JENNY: All right, let's go

08:53.333 --> 08:54.334
get 'em.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.303
>> CAITLYN: We're gonna do this.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.741
(doorbell rings)

09:00.741 --> 09:01.742
>> CAITLYN: And here they come!

09:01.742 --> 09:02.509
>> JENNY: All right, let's go

09:02.509 --> 09:03.510
get 'em.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.511
>> CAITLYN: We're gonna do this.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.512
Hello.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.513
The first to arrive, baby, how

09:06.513 --> 09:07.781
are you doing?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.983
>> CANDIS: Hello.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.085
You look incredible.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.987
>> CAITLYN: And so do you!

09:13.987 --> 09:14.988
>> CANDIS: Yay.

09:14.988 --> 09:15.989
>> CAITLYN: How are you doing,

09:15.989 --> 09:16.624
babe?

09:16.624 --> 09:17.625
>> CANDIS: I'm doing great.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.627
My name is Candis Cayne, and I'm

09:19.627 --> 09:23.631
an actress, showgirl, performer,

09:23.631 --> 09:26.967
high-kicker, high-stepper.

09:26.967 --> 09:27.968
>> JENNY: I've never been with

09:27.968 --> 09:29.036
so many tall women in my life.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.037
>> CAITLYN: Isn't it great?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.038
You're the shortest one in the

09:31.038 --> 09:31.538
room.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.040
>> JENNY: I know! One second...

09:33.040 --> 09:34.241
>> CANDIS: When I started my

09:34.241 --> 09:38.078
transition in '95, there was no

09:38.078 --> 09:39.680
manual, there was no way of,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.381
like, figuring out how to do it.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.350
It was all kind of black market.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.718
Get your shots from the corner

09:44.718 --> 09:47.254
store that had a, you know,

09:47.254 --> 09:48.488
a secret knock to get your

09:48.488 --> 09:49.489
hormones, you know, that kind of

09:49.489 --> 09:50.490
thing.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.091
>> RONDA: I'm Ronda.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.092
>> CHANDI: Hi, Ronda, I'm

09:52.092 --> 09:52.660
Chandi.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.961
>> RONDA: Nice to meet you.

09:53.961 --> 09:54.962
>> CAITLYN: Hello.

09:54.962 --> 09:55.796
>> DRIAN: Hi, oh, my God, I

09:55.796 --> 09:56.797
didn't recognize you-- you look

09:56.797 --> 09:57.798
incredible.

09:57.798 --> 09:58.799
>> CAITLYN: Well, I know.

09:58.799 --> 09:59.800
I know.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.801
Come on, let's go in the living

10:00.801 --> 10:01.802
room, we'll sit down.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.436
>> CHANDI: All righty.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.305
>> CAITLYN: This is so much fun.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.306
>> COURTNEY: They have a lot to

10:06.306 --> 10:08.341
talk about.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.476
>> CAITLYN: It's pronounced

10:09.476 --> 10:10.477
"Shardee"? Or...

10:10.477 --> 10:11.478
>> CHANDI: Chandi.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.479
>> CAITLYN: Chandi, okay, with

10:12.479 --> 10:12.980
an "N."

10:12.980 --> 10:14.047
>> CHANDI: Like "Candy."

10:14.047 --> 10:15.048
>> CAITLYN: Okay... I got to get

10:15.048 --> 10:16.349
'em all right.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.885
>> CHANDI: The transition period

10:17.885 --> 10:19.920
for me-- it was rough.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.188
Uh, totally a different journey

10:21.188 --> 10:23.523
than what Caitlyn experienced.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.993
It was hard enough for my family

10:25.993 --> 10:28.996
to accept me being gay, but to

10:28.996 --> 10:32.199
want to be considered a woman--

10:32.199 --> 10:33.701
that was, like, taking it to the

10:33.701 --> 10:34.702
next level.

10:34.702 --> 10:35.703
>> CAITLYN: You made it!

10:35.703 --> 10:36.469
>> JEN: Yes, I did, hi, how are

10:36.469 --> 10:37.470
you?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.205
>> CAITLYN: Good, good to see

10:38.205 --> 10:39.206
you, thank you for coming.

10:39.206 --> 10:39.740
Thanks for coming.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.741
>> JEN: My pleasure.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.742
My name is Jen Richards.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.343
I came out and transitioned

10:43.343 --> 10:44.712
about three and a half years

10:44.712 --> 10:45.713
ago.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.080
At the time, I was the managing

10:47.080 --> 10:48.849
director of a contemporary

10:48.849 --> 10:50.550
classical chamber ensemble.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.584
About that time, I also started

10:51.584 --> 10:52.920
engaging in activism.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.187
I launched a Web site called

10:54.187 --> 10:55.889
We Happy Trans, which was

10:55.889 --> 10:57.124
designed to highlight positive

10:57.124 --> 10:58.125
trans experiences.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.126
I was kind of tired of only

10:59.126 --> 11:00.127
hearing about trans people in

11:00.127 --> 11:01.194
their death.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.195
I really wanted a chance to

11:02.195 --> 11:02.930
shine a spotlight on the people

11:02.930 --> 11:03.931
who are alive and doing great

11:03.931 --> 11:04.431
work today.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.432
>> ZACKARY: You look incredible.

11:05.432 --> 11:05.999
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.000
>> DRIAN: I didn't recognize

11:07.000 --> 11:07.500
her.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.501
>> ZACKARY: You look really,

11:08.501 --> 11:09.770
truly incredible.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.938
>> CAITLYN: I appreciate that.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.039
>> CANDIS: It's difficult for

11:12.039 --> 11:14.074
somebody that has been so

11:14.074 --> 11:16.376
sheltered to understand the life

11:16.376 --> 11:18.111
of-of some trans women, but I

11:18.111 --> 11:21.181
think by asking us all to share

11:21.181 --> 11:22.349
our experiences, Cait's doing

11:22.349 --> 11:23.416
the right thing: she's learning

11:23.416 --> 11:24.417
from people who've lived the

11:24.417 --> 11:25.418
life.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.419
>> CAITLYN: I am so excited

11:26.419 --> 11:27.420
about this evening.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.289
Um, I got a lot to learn, you

11:29.289 --> 11:31.124
know?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.625
I've been out for two weeks.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.527
>> CANDIS: Yay, welcome!

11:34.527 --> 11:35.528
>> CAITLYN: I'm a baby,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.030
okay, yay!

11:37.030 --> 11:38.598
Okay.

11:38.598 --> 11:39.833
Yeah, I'm talking all of your

11:39.833 --> 11:42.269
fantasies in life coming true

11:42.269 --> 11:43.503
when Vanity Fair was here,

11:43.503 --> 11:44.504
shooting.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.273
Annie Leibovitz started crying.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.241
>> JEN: Wow, amazing.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.877
>> COURTNEY: She's loving this.

11:49.877 --> 11:50.878
She's never had a girls' night

11:50.878 --> 11:51.879
like this.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.346
>> RONDA: I know.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.515
I feel kind of jealous.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.784
>> DRIAN: This is really just a

11:56.784 --> 11:59.286
monumental event, you know?

11:59.286 --> 12:00.788
I remember growing up with no

12:00.788 --> 12:01.789
trans people anywhere.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.790
>> CHANDI: Right.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.791
>> DRIAN: And so, to see

12:03.791 --> 12:04.792
somebody on the cover of

12:04.792 --> 12:06.326
Vanity Fair, on the Diane

12:06.326 --> 12:07.560
Sawyer interview-- that is

12:07.560 --> 12:08.896
changing for the children,

12:08.896 --> 12:09.897
especially.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.264
>> JEN: So inspirational.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.266
>> DRIAN: I love being a trans

12:13.266 --> 12:14.267
person.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.903
It's a true gift.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.237
And I always think about the

12:17.237 --> 12:19.039
youth who are suffering and who

12:19.039 --> 12:20.207
are in states where they can't

12:20.207 --> 12:21.541
transition, they can't live free

12:21.541 --> 12:22.542
lives.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.944
You know, for them to see that

12:23.944 --> 12:26.513
you may be struggling right now,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.281
but that's not forever.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.582
And there's definitely a light

12:29.582 --> 12:30.951
at the end of the tunnel, and

12:30.951 --> 12:32.119
you just have to be true to

12:32.119 --> 12:34.221
yourself and love yourself.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.422
>> CHANDI: I love having

12:35.422 --> 12:36.689
conversations with people who

12:36.689 --> 12:38.425
try to tell me that I'm going to

12:38.425 --> 12:41.261
hell for being secure in who I

12:41.261 --> 12:43.530
am, when God knew who-who I was

12:43.530 --> 12:45.165
before I did.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.900
We bleed the same, so why not

12:46.900 --> 12:49.136
use love?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.137
Just love.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.138
>> JEN: Right.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.205
>> CHANDI: It's not that hard.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.740
It's not that hard for us to be

12:53.740 --> 12:56.109
able to embrace things that we

12:56.109 --> 12:58.045
may not understand.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.212
>> COURTNEY: In the community,

12:59.212 --> 13:02.149
do you think people are going to

13:02.149 --> 13:04.284
embrace Caitlyn and what she's

13:04.284 --> 13:05.285
done?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.453
Or do you think they're going to

13:06.453 --> 13:08.388
be envious?

13:08.388 --> 13:09.656
>> JENNY: What you should expect

13:09.656 --> 13:11.391
people to say is, "Caitlyn is a

13:11.391 --> 13:14.161
sweet, smart, good soul who

13:14.161 --> 13:15.595
wants to do good in the world,

13:15.595 --> 13:18.231
but has every advantage, every

13:18.231 --> 13:19.699
privilege in the world."

13:19.699 --> 13:21.134
And that the world is full of

13:21.134 --> 13:22.302
people that no one wants to take

13:22.302 --> 13:23.303
their picture.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.304
>> JEN: We can support an

13:24.304 --> 13:25.705
individual trans person and

13:25.705 --> 13:27.574
celebrate their authenticity

13:27.574 --> 13:28.876
and their-their place for

13:28.876 --> 13:30.210
dignity and what they do with

13:30.210 --> 13:31.244
their privilege while still

13:31.244 --> 13:32.512
calling into question a system

13:32.512 --> 13:34.882
that makes this particular story

13:34.882 --> 13:36.583
the one that we finally listen

13:36.583 --> 13:38.185
to while we've been ignoring the

13:38.185 --> 13:40.153
stories of black and Latina

13:40.153 --> 13:41.354
trans women, poor trans women,

13:41.354 --> 13:42.355
trans women.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.656
Cait's experience of coming out

13:43.656 --> 13:44.925
is singular.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.193
I-I don't think in history

13:46.193 --> 13:47.627
anyone has ever been so publicly

13:47.627 --> 13:48.628
welcomed.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.997
For most of us, coming out is a

13:49.997 --> 13:51.598
really kind of terrifying,

13:51.598 --> 13:53.200
horrifying experience.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.268
And it's a little discomforting

13:55.268 --> 13:57.237
that everything Cait says is

13:57.237 --> 13:58.671
gonna receive far more attention

13:58.671 --> 13:59.806
than anything anyone else in the

13:59.806 --> 14:01.541
community will say, and she has

14:01.541 --> 14:03.010
relatively little experience in

14:03.010 --> 14:04.277
the community.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.046
So I think everyone is a little

14:06.046 --> 14:07.147
bit cautious.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.348
>> CANDIS: You know, the trans

14:08.348 --> 14:09.349
community was invisible ten

14:09.349 --> 14:10.350
years ago.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.351
>> CHANDI: Yes.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.352
>> CANDIS: So the fact...

14:12.352 --> 14:13.353
>> JEN: Except for Jerry

14:13.353 --> 14:13.921
Springer.

14:13.921 --> 14:14.922
>> CANDIS: Except for Jerry

14:14.922 --> 14:15.388
Springer.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.389
>> JEN: Maury Povich and Donahue

14:16.389 --> 14:17.390
and...

14:17.390 --> 14:19.159
>> CANDIS: Exactly, and so to

14:19.159 --> 14:22.295
actually... to-to be, as an

14:22.295 --> 14:24.697
actress, to be doing roles and,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.366
like, going to auditions--

14:26.366 --> 14:28.768
that's, like, a huge thing.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.769
>> JEN: Right.

14:29.769 --> 14:30.770
>> CANDIS: But, like, then you

14:30.770 --> 14:32.105
have other stuff, like life and

14:32.105 --> 14:33.941
trying to pay rent and trying to

14:33.941 --> 14:34.942
get medical care.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.409
I mean, you know, just last year

14:36.409 --> 14:38.011
I was trying to find a doctor to

14:38.011 --> 14:40.013
get hormones from.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.014
You know what I mean?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.749
And I tried to go into the... to

14:42.749 --> 14:44.551
the LBG center, and they were

14:44.551 --> 14:45.585
like, "We're booked up."

14:45.585 --> 14:46.987
My girlfriend was like, "Come to

14:46.987 --> 14:47.988
my doctor."

14:47.988 --> 14:49.089
And I went in and the doctor

14:49.089 --> 14:50.157
said to her, "Oh, you're not

14:50.157 --> 14:51.158
bringing any more of those

14:51.158 --> 14:52.159
people in, are you?"

14:52.159 --> 14:54.227
>> CAITLYN: Really?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.228
>> JENNY: "Those people."

14:55.228 --> 14:56.229
>> CHANDI: "Those people."

14:56.229 --> 14:57.230
>> CANDIS: And I was like,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.066
"Wow," like, it's still

14:59.066 --> 15:00.267
happening, you know?

15:00.267 --> 15:01.334
>> CHANDI: Still, today.

15:01.334 --> 15:01.969
>> CAITLYN: Really, that

15:01.969 --> 15:02.970
happened to you?

15:02.970 --> 15:03.436
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.604
>> CHANDI: Yes, Cait, that

15:04.604 --> 15:06.106
happens all the time-- a day in

15:06.106 --> 15:08.441
the life of being trans.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.978
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.312
Hearing Candis' story is

15:12.312 --> 15:14.647
shocking to me.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.317
Um, I can't believe some people

15:17.317 --> 15:20.753
would act that way.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.190
Honestly, this is really scaring

15:23.190 --> 15:24.191
me.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.425
I have been catapulted into the

15:25.425 --> 15:26.493
spotlight, becoming a

15:26.493 --> 15:28.228
spokesperson for the transgender

15:28.228 --> 15:30.730
community, but, oh, my God, what

15:30.730 --> 15:33.900
if people turn on me like that?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.335
>> RONDA: Dinner is served!

15:35.335 --> 15:36.403
>> CAITLYN: Okay, let's go, come

15:36.403 --> 15:37.404
on, let's go get something to

15:37.404 --> 15:37.904
eat.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.606
>> DRIAN: Let's do it.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.607
>> JENNY: I-I will tell you that

15:40.607 --> 15:42.009
my... that my last name is

15:42.009 --> 15:43.043
Boylan-- Jenny Boylan.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.045
There are... my students have

15:45.045 --> 15:47.747
not... have called me "J. Bo."

15:47.747 --> 15:50.117
>> CAITLYN: Really?

15:50.117 --> 15:51.118
>> JENNY: Which I think is

15:51.118 --> 15:52.119
very funny.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.120
>> CHANDI: Well, I came from the

15:53.120 --> 15:55.055
world of drag.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.923
And I needed to come up with a

15:56.923 --> 15:59.426
name really quick, so I became

15:59.426 --> 16:02.329
Miss Chandelier, and then, as I

16:02.329 --> 16:04.297
decided to transition and become

16:04.297 --> 16:06.033
full-time, I felt like

16:06.033 --> 16:07.667
Chandelier was too dramatic for

16:07.667 --> 16:09.502
the daytime.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.771
So I chopped it off to Chandi

16:11.771 --> 16:12.872
and it has stuck.

16:12.872 --> 16:13.873
So that's kind of, like, how I

16:13.873 --> 16:14.374
got my name.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.375
>> JENNY: Wow, that's a great

16:15.375 --> 16:15.875
story.

16:15.875 --> 16:16.876
>> JEN: I don't think any of us

16:16.876 --> 16:17.877
can top that-- we should have

16:17.877 --> 16:18.878
gone with you last.

16:18.878 --> 16:19.879
That's too good.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.614
>> JENNY: I cannot top that.

16:21.614 --> 16:22.615
The first night you were ever in

16:22.615 --> 16:24.117
a room with with-with more than

16:24.117 --> 16:26.719
one transgender woman was...

16:26.719 --> 16:27.720
>> CAITLYN: Oh, about an hour

16:27.720 --> 16:28.721
ago, couple hours ago, yeah.

16:28.721 --> 16:29.722
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, that's

16:29.722 --> 16:30.223
amazing.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.224
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. I-I couldn't.

16:31.224 --> 16:31.924
>> CANDIS: That's amazing.

16:31.924 --> 16:32.925
>> CAITLYN: I was isolated from

16:32.925 --> 16:34.061
the world, I couldn't do that.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.362
'Cause I moved in here and then

16:35.362 --> 16:36.363
kind of had one little, uh,

16:36.363 --> 16:37.364
procedure after another, here.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.365
>> CANDIS: Well, it's worked,

16:38.365 --> 16:38.865
honey.

16:38.865 --> 16:39.866
>> CAITLYN: I know. (laughs)

16:39.866 --> 16:40.600
>> CANDIS: Whatever they did, it

16:40.600 --> 16:41.601
worked.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.269
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.270
>> CANDIS: You look... you look

16:43.270 --> 16:44.271
amazing.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.972
>> CAITLYN: But, um, actually,

16:45.972 --> 16:47.340
one of the things I've wondered

16:47.340 --> 16:48.541
about-- everybody seems to have

16:48.541 --> 16:50.710
pretty good vocal cords.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.978
That's always been a concern for

16:51.978 --> 16:53.380
me, from the beginning.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.681
>> JEN: Ah, interesting.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.682
>> CAITLYN: What have you guys

16:55.682 --> 16:56.749
done?

16:56.749 --> 16:57.750
>> CHANDI: I haven't done one

16:57.750 --> 16:58.751
thing.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.087
>> CAITLYN: Thank God, girl, I

17:00.087 --> 17:01.554
like that, okay?

17:01.554 --> 17:02.955
>> CHANDI: When people say, "Oh,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.157
you need to talk like this."

17:04.157 --> 17:05.958
Child, cheese, I don't have time

17:05.958 --> 17:08.695
to be trying to maintain that.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.896
I feel like if you're gonna

17:09.896 --> 17:11.364
accept me, you're gonna accept

17:11.364 --> 17:12.365
me, so...

17:12.365 --> 17:13.433
>> JEN: I worked really hard on

17:13.433 --> 17:14.434
changing my voice.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.435
>> DRIAN: Really?

17:15.435 --> 17:16.636
>> JEN: Oh, God, yeah.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.105
My voice was lower than yours,

17:18.105 --> 17:19.206
much lower than yours.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.707
Um, I did see a vocal therapist

17:20.707 --> 17:21.774
in Chicago-- God, I've never

17:21.774 --> 17:22.775
talked about this.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.344
Um, but, yeah, I did see a vocal

17:24.344 --> 17:25.478
therapist and just learned some

17:25.478 --> 17:26.846
basic techniques to raise the

17:26.846 --> 17:27.847
pitch a-a little bit.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.349
I just hated being called "sir"

17:29.349 --> 17:30.450
on the phone.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.519
I hated being outed by my voice.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.121
>> CANDIS: I was walking in a

17:34.121 --> 17:35.455
New York subway and I was

17:35.455 --> 17:37.390
feeling grand prize and I was in

17:37.390 --> 17:39.526
my skirt and I was flipping my

17:39.526 --> 17:42.329
hair and this, like, woman

17:42.329 --> 17:43.863
walks by me, she's, like,

17:43.863 --> 17:45.898
limping-- she has, like, a cane.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.001
So I hear a clunk, clunk.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.638
"That's a man."

17:51.638 --> 17:52.639
>> JENNY: Yeah.

17:52.639 --> 17:53.640
>> CANDIS: And I hear it louder.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.641
"That's a man."

17:54.641 --> 17:55.642
>> CAITLYN: And just...

17:55.642 --> 17:56.643
>> CANDIS: And then starting

17:56.643 --> 17:57.644
going, "That's a man!"

17:57.644 --> 17:58.645
(laughter)

17:58.645 --> 18:02.149
And I...

18:02.149 --> 18:03.150
Oh.

18:03.150 --> 18:03.950
>> ZACKARY: And once you've

18:03.950 --> 18:04.784
survived that, you realize that

18:04.784 --> 18:05.785
it's okay.

18:05.785 --> 18:06.619
(laughter, overlapping chatter)

18:06.619 --> 18:07.354
>> CANDIS: Yeah, you can survive

18:07.354 --> 18:08.355
anything.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.156
>> ZACKARY: Confidence is

18:09.156 --> 18:10.157
contagious.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.158
>> DRIAN: Yes. Yes.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.159
>> CAITLYN: Totally. Yeah.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.160
>> CHANDI: Right.

18:13.160 --> 18:13.926
>> JEN: Guys, what we need is

18:13.926 --> 18:15.162
one straight male celebrity to

18:15.162 --> 18:16.329
stand up in public and say,

18:16.329 --> 18:17.330
"Yeah, my girlfriend's trans.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.331
She's a woman."

18:18.331 --> 18:19.332
>> CHANDI: Right.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.167
>> CAITLYN: Does anybody... does

18:20.167 --> 18:21.168
anybody know one?

18:21.168 --> 18:22.169
>> JEN: No. Never.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.170
>> CHANDI: No.

18:23.170 --> 18:23.836
>> JENNY: And the narrative is,

18:23.836 --> 18:24.737
it's so much more shameful than

18:24.737 --> 18:27.240
some other woman, you know?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.241
>> JEN: Yup. Exactly.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.376
>> DRIAN: Oh, yeah.

18:29.376 --> 18:32.044
I was an immigrant, so I came to

18:32.044 --> 18:33.045
this country not speaking the

18:33.045 --> 18:34.046
language, not, you know, being

18:34.046 --> 18:35.047
familiar with anything.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.048
>> CAITLYN: Where did you come

18:36.048 --> 18:37.049
from?

18:37.049 --> 18:37.950
>> DRIAN: Mexico, and so,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.852
acclimating to culture and being

18:39.852 --> 18:42.189
gender variant, um, you know, it

18:42.189 --> 18:43.323
was always really tough.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.793
And, um, I had gone to college,

18:46.793 --> 18:48.861
I had a degree, I was working,

18:48.861 --> 18:50.062
and my insurance didn't cover

18:50.062 --> 18:51.364
any of my transitional-related

18:51.364 --> 18:52.365
care.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.501
And at that point, I was doing

18:54.501 --> 18:55.935
sex work.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.004
That was the only way I could

18:58.004 --> 18:59.105
transition.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.407
If I couldn't transition, I

19:00.407 --> 19:01.474
didn't want to live anymore.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.475
I just didn't want to live a

19:02.475 --> 19:03.476
lie.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.811
I wanted to be myself.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.679
And I was asking the universe.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.681
I was saying, "Change the way I

19:08.681 --> 19:09.682
see the world so I can see my

19:09.682 --> 19:10.683
way out of doing sex work."

19:10.683 --> 19:11.684
>> CAITLYN: Hmm.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.685
>> DRIAN: So I felt really

19:12.685 --> 19:13.686
horrible about that, that I

19:13.686 --> 19:14.687
really...

19:14.687 --> 19:15.688
>> CAITLYN: Have you ever talked

19:15.688 --> 19:16.689
to Janet Mock about it?

19:16.689 --> 19:17.690
>> DRIAN: No.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.691
>> CAITLYN: You should read her

19:18.691 --> 19:19.692
book.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.693
>> DRIAN: Yeah.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.594
>> CAITLYN: That's how she paid

19:21.594 --> 19:23.730
for it.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.997
>> CHANDI: Cait thinks that

19:24.997 --> 19:26.233
because she read a couple of

19:26.233 --> 19:27.700
pages in a book that she's in

19:27.700 --> 19:28.701
the know, but she doesn't get

19:28.701 --> 19:29.702
it.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.238
She doesn't realize how common

19:31.238 --> 19:32.805
sex work stories are.

19:32.805 --> 19:33.973
She could never understand how

19:33.973 --> 19:35.308
it would feel to walk in those

19:35.308 --> 19:36.309
shoes.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.377
If she's going to become our

19:37.377 --> 19:38.845
representative, Cait needs to

19:38.845 --> 19:41.881
learn the struggle we all face.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.285
>> CAITLYN: I say we go to San

19:45.285 --> 19:46.286
Francisco.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.287
We could rent a bus.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.288
Like Priscilla.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.289
>> JENNY: Seriously?

19:49.289 --> 19:50.290
>> JEN: Like Priscilla.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.291
>> JENNY: Right, that's...

19:51.291 --> 19:52.292
How do we sneak you out of here?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.293
>> CAITLYN: In a trunk.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.294
Uh, could this be the paparazzi

19:54.294 --> 19:55.295
right here?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.296
>> RONDA: Is this paparazzi?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.297
>> CAITLYN: Are we moving?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.298
>> RONDA: All right. Yes.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.299
>> JOE: Finally.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.300
>> RONDA: Jump in... behind...

20:00.300 --> 20:01.301
>> CAITLYN: Hello, girls.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.302
(whooping and cheering)

20:02.302 --> 20:04.871
Hey!

20:04.871 --> 20:05.872
(applause and cheering)

20:05.872 --> 20:07.440
>> ANGELICA: I still haven't

20:07.440 --> 20:09.242
been able to access what you've

20:09.242 --> 20:11.411
been able to access so quickly.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.412
>> BLOSSOM: Let's just be real.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.413
It has something to do with your

20:13.413 --> 20:14.447
social economical status.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.715
>> CHANDI: It's not your

20:15.715 --> 20:17.049
problem, but it would be great

20:17.049 --> 20:18.285
if you would just step up and

20:18.285 --> 20:19.652
let the people who are doing

20:19.652 --> 20:21.321
wrong know that they're wrong.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.923
>> ALISON: Uh-huh.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.326
>> JEN: I have a bunch of

20:26.326 --> 20:27.327
friends in San Francisco that I

20:27.327 --> 20:28.328
would love to introduce you to

20:28.328 --> 20:29.329
and hear some stories.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.330
>> CAITLYN: Oh.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.264
>> JEN: Oh, well, there's also

20:31.264 --> 20:32.332
an HRC office there, so I could

20:32.332 --> 20:33.533
introduce you to some of those

20:33.533 --> 20:34.534
people, too, and we can start

20:34.534 --> 20:35.535
talking about...

20:35.535 --> 20:36.536
>> CAITLYN: Explain HRC.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.371
>> JEN: Oh, HRC is the Human

20:38.371 --> 20:39.772
Rights Campaign, which is one of

20:39.772 --> 20:40.940
the world's biggest LGBT

20:40.940 --> 20:43.175
advocacy organizations.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.344
What you should really do is

20:44.344 --> 20:45.345
hear some of their stories about

20:45.345 --> 20:46.346
what they've been through.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.347
>> CAITLYN: Oh, we should go

20:47.347 --> 20:48.348
there.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.349
>> JEN: Really?

20:49.349 --> 20:50.350
>> CAITLYN: Why not?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.351
I say we go to San Francisco.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.352
(Jen laughs and claps)

20:52.352 --> 20:53.353
>> JENNY: All right.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.153
>> JEN: Well, are you serious?

20:54.153 --> 20:55.154
>> CAITLYN: Why not?

20:55.154 --> 20:55.988
What's holding us back?

20:55.988 --> 20:56.989
We could rent a bus.

20:56.989 --> 20:57.990
A big camper.

20:57.990 --> 20:58.991
>> JEN: Are you serious?

20:58.991 --> 20:59.992
>> JENNY: Yeah, a bus.

20:59.992 --> 21:00.993
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, like

21:00.993 --> 21:02.061
Priscilla.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.062
>> JENNY: Seriously?

21:03.062 --> 21:04.096
>> JEN: Like Priscilla?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.197
>> JENNY: Right, that's...

21:05.197 --> 21:06.633
>> CAITLYN: All we got to do is

21:06.633 --> 21:07.634
sneak me out of here.

21:07.634 --> 21:08.635
>> JENNY: How do we sneak you

21:08.635 --> 21:09.636
out of here?

21:09.636 --> 21:10.637
>> CAITLYN: In a trunk.

21:10.637 --> 21:11.638
>> JENNY: This could be fun.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.639
>> CAITLYN: Road trip!

21:12.639 --> 21:13.640
>> JENNY: Road trip!

21:13.640 --> 21:14.641
>> JEN: Road trip! Yes!

21:14.641 --> 21:15.642
>> JENNY: Yeah.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.643
>> CAITLYN: San Francisco, here

21:16.643 --> 21:17.644
we come!

21:17.644 --> 21:20.613
(laughter)

21:23.650 --> 21:24.651
(door closes)

21:24.651 --> 21:25.652
>> CAITLYN: Hey, babe.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.486
>> MADDIE: We brought Starbucks.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.754
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

21:27.754 --> 21:28.755
>> RONDA: What are you wearing,

21:28.755 --> 21:29.956
you little...?

21:29.956 --> 21:30.957
>> MADDIE: A romper.

21:30.957 --> 21:31.958
>> SPENCER: You're wearing a

21:31.958 --> 21:33.125
romper.

21:33.125 --> 21:33.960
>> RONDA: I'm wearing a romper.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.827
>> MADDIE: It's promper, proper

21:34.827 --> 21:35.828
romper.

21:35.828 --> 21:36.663
>> RONDA: Thank you, honey

21:36.663 --> 21:37.664
bunny.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.665
We need to start packing.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.666
Five days.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.667
>> CAITLYN: Five days.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.501
>> RONDA: So you need four night

21:41.501 --> 21:42.435
outfits, bathing suits...

21:42.435 --> 21:43.436
>> CAITLYN: Okay, wait.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.437
>> SPENCER: Yeah, bathing suits.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.372
>> MADDIE: Bathing suits.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.172
>> CAITLYN: Are we actually

21:46.172 --> 21:47.173
doing bathing suits?

21:47.173 --> 21:48.007
>> RONDA: Yes. There's a

21:48.007 --> 21:49.008
swimming pool.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.009
Which drawer is your... bathing

21:50.009 --> 21:51.010
suits in?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.011
>> CAITLYN: That's like...

21:52.011 --> 21:53.012
>> MADDIE: Are they in here?

21:53.012 --> 21:53.846
>> CAITLYN: ...the scariest

21:53.846 --> 21:54.681
thing I've ever heard.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.515
>> RONDA: You want to bet?

21:55.515 --> 21:56.383
I've seen you in your bathing

21:56.383 --> 21:57.384
suits.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.184
>> CAITLYN: Having the

21:58.184 --> 21:59.018
opportunity to go out with these

21:59.018 --> 22:00.252
girls, go on the road, pack all

22:00.252 --> 22:03.089
of Caitlyn's stuff is to me so

22:03.089 --> 22:03.890
freeing.

22:03.890 --> 22:04.924
I've never gone on the road with

22:04.924 --> 22:05.925
just Caitlyn clothes.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.894
I mean, it's just never

22:07.894 --> 22:08.895
happened, couldn't happen.

22:08.895 --> 22:09.896
>> RONDA: Well, this is cute

22:09.896 --> 22:10.897
just for fun.

22:10.897 --> 22:11.798
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, that's-that's

22:11.798 --> 22:12.799
fun.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.633
>> RONDA: But you need a sexy

22:13.633 --> 22:14.634
one for Candis.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.635
>> MADDIE AND SPENCER: Who is

22:15.635 --> 22:16.636
Candis?

22:16.636 --> 22:17.470
>> CAITLYN: We're not going

22:17.470 --> 22:18.471
there.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.305
>> RONDA: Who's Candis?

22:19.305 --> 22:20.139
>> CAITLYN: A girl that's going

22:20.139 --> 22:21.140
on the trip with us.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.141
>> SPENCER: That's it?

22:22.141 --> 22:23.275
Do you find her attractive?

22:23.275 --> 22:25.778
>> CAITLYN: No, no. No, no, no.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.913
Well, she's a very attractive

22:26.913 --> 22:28.047
lady, yeah.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.916
>> SPENCER: Which one's Candis?

22:29.916 --> 22:30.917
>> SPENCER AND MADDIE: Oh!

22:30.917 --> 22:31.751
>> RONDA: And look how close she

22:31.751 --> 22:32.752
is next... Look.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.753
Oh, yeah.

22:33.753 --> 22:34.754
>> SPENCER: Oh!

22:34.754 --> 22:36.789
>> RONDA: Oh! Hot mama.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.924
>> CAITLYN: These girls won't

22:37.924 --> 22:39.125
give up, and I get it.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.061
Candis is a beautiful woman, but

22:42.061 --> 22:45.331
as far as dating in the future--

22:45.331 --> 22:48.067
I have absolutely no idea.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.068
>> SPENCER: Mom, are you going

22:49.068 --> 22:50.069
on the road trip?

22:50.069 --> 22:50.903
>> CAITLYN: You should go.

22:50.903 --> 22:51.738
>> SPENCER: Mom, you really need

22:51.738 --> 22:52.739
to have some fun.

22:52.739 --> 22:53.740
>> MADDIE: Yeah.

22:53.740 --> 22:54.574
>> CAITLYN: That's exactly

22:54.574 --> 22:55.575
right.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.443
You got all this work ahead of

22:56.443 --> 22:57.243
you, you got to move.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.244
>> SPENCER: Yeah.

22:58.244 --> 22:59.078
>> CAITLYN: You get a few days.

22:59.078 --> 22:59.912
I'll keep her out of you guys'

22:59.912 --> 23:00.747
hair for a couple of days, yeah.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.648
>> MADDIE: Yeah. Thank God.

23:01.648 --> 23:02.482
>> RONDA: No. Wait. Wait, wait.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.483
Wait.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.316
>> MADDIE: Get out of here.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.151
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, not to work.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.152
You're coming for fun.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.153
>> RONDA: Okay.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.321
I've known Bruce for about 15

23:09.321 --> 23:10.523
years.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.091
Throughout those years, we've

23:12.091 --> 23:13.192
been friends.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.094
We became quite close probably

23:15.094 --> 23:16.896
about three years ago when I

23:16.896 --> 23:19.466
first found out she was Caitlyn.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.233
I started working for her, and

23:21.233 --> 23:23.536
she didn't have anyone really

23:23.536 --> 23:24.537
that she confided in.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.506
It was for two years pretty much

23:26.506 --> 23:28.641
just the two of us, because it's

23:28.641 --> 23:30.477
been hidden and private.

23:30.477 --> 23:31.844
I look forward to just having

23:31.844 --> 23:32.845
fun and relaxing.

23:32.845 --> 23:33.846
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

23:33.846 --> 23:34.681
>> RONDA: Well, now that I'm

23:34.681 --> 23:35.682
going, I have to pack, too.

23:35.682 --> 23:36.683
>> CAITLYN: Oh.

23:36.683 --> 23:37.517
>> SPENCER: Yeah, you need to

23:37.517 --> 23:38.518
pack.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.351
>> CAITLYN: Look at all these

23:39.351 --> 23:40.352
bags.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.353
My first trip.

23:41.353 --> 23:42.354
All those bags, and I still

23:42.354 --> 23:44.123
don't know if I have everything.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.357
>> RONDA: Why am I carrying all

23:45.357 --> 23:46.358
the bags?

23:46.358 --> 23:47.226
>> CAITLYN: They're out here.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.227
They'll know.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.228
>> RONDA: Whatever. Oh!

23:49.228 --> 23:50.229
>> COURTNEY: Peanut? Peanut?

23:50.229 --> 23:51.230
Stay here.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.264
>> RONDA: So where are we going

23:52.264 --> 23:53.265
now? What's the plan?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.266
>> CAITLYN: Oh, we're gonna

23:54.266 --> 23:55.301
rendezvous with the other

23:55.301 --> 23:56.302
girls.

23:56.302 --> 23:57.303
>> COURTNEY: Uh-huh.

23:57.303 --> 23:58.170
>> CAITLYN: And we're going to

23:58.170 --> 23:59.171
get the bus.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.039
I mean, this is like a big

24:00.039 --> 24:01.040
camper, you know, really cool.

24:01.040 --> 24:01.941
>> RONDA: Oh. Is that weird for

24:01.941 --> 24:02.775
the other girls that we are not

24:02.775 --> 24:03.776
trans?

24:03.776 --> 24:04.777
>> RONDA: That's true.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.612
>> CAITLYN: You're the only cis

24:05.612 --> 24:06.613
girls on the trip.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.514
>> RONDA: What does "cis" mean?

24:07.514 --> 24:08.280
>> COURTNEY: What does "cis"

24:08.280 --> 24:09.281
mean?

24:09.281 --> 24:10.282
>> RONDA: Like sissy?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.117
>> CAITLYN (laughing): What does

24:11.117 --> 24:12.118
"cis..."?

24:12.118 --> 24:13.119
It means, um...

24:13.119 --> 24:14.120
>> COURTNEY: Sissy?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.121
>> CAITLYN: ...men or women who

24:15.121 --> 24:16.122
are not transgender.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.123
You know those types.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.124
>> COURTNEY: Okay.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.125
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.126
Uh, could this be the paparazzi

24:20.126 --> 24:21.127
right here?

24:21.127 --> 24:22.128
>> RONDA: Is this paparazzi?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.129
>> COURTNEY: Everybody, look the

24:23.129 --> 24:24.130
other way.

24:24.130 --> 24:24.964
>> CAITLYN: Everybody's gonna

24:24.964 --> 24:25.965
split up.

24:25.965 --> 24:26.966
>> RONDA: Oh, my goodness.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.967
>> CAITLYN: Ever since the

24:27.967 --> 24:29.536
Vanity Fair article came out,

24:29.536 --> 24:30.737
the paparazzi have been

24:30.737 --> 24:33.172
following me everywhere.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.273
Some of my kids haven't even met

24:34.273 --> 24:35.274
Caitlyn.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.409
So I really want to stay away

24:37.409 --> 24:38.778
from the paparazzi right now.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.279
I don't want the crazy tabloid

24:40.279 --> 24:42.549
media to write stupid stories.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.550
>> RONDA: Okay.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.551
>> COURTNEY: The neighbors are

24:44.551 --> 24:45.552
gonna come out.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.352
>> CAITLYN: Let's go, guys.

24:46.352 --> 24:47.353
Let's just do it.

24:47.353 --> 24:48.855
If I can just get out of town,

24:48.855 --> 24:50.156
I'll have so much more freedom,

24:50.156 --> 24:51.357
'cause they'll never figure out

24:51.357 --> 24:52.759
where I am and what I'm doing.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.193
Are we moving?

24:54.193 --> 24:55.194
>> RONDA: All right. Yes.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.195
>> JOE: All right. Finally.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.429
>> RONDA: Jump in behind...

24:57.429 --> 24:58.430
Well, there is people.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.866
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

24:59.866 --> 25:00.867
>> COURTNEY: Right here.

25:00.867 --> 25:01.768
>> CAITLYN: Okay, are we ready?

25:01.768 --> 25:02.602
Is everything moved around?

25:02.602 --> 25:05.237
>> RONDA: Get in there.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.574
>> CAITLYN: Are we moving?

25:07.574 --> 25:08.575
>> RONDA: All right. Yes.

25:08.575 --> 25:09.408
>> JOE: All right. Finally.

25:09.408 --> 25:10.209
>> RONDA: Jump in... behind...

25:10.209 --> 25:11.043
Well, there is people.

25:11.043 --> 25:11.878
>> COURTNEY: Right here.

25:11.878 --> 25:12.745
>> RONDA: Hurry, hurry, hurry!

25:12.745 --> 25:13.580
>> CAITLYN: Okay, are we ready?

25:13.580 --> 25:14.413
Is everything moved around?

25:14.413 --> 25:15.414
>> RONDA: Get in there!

25:15.414 --> 25:17.383
>> CAITLYN: Hello, girls!

25:17.383 --> 25:18.384
>> CANDIS: You're so kind.

25:18.384 --> 25:19.218
>> CAITLYN: Hello, babe.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.219
How you doing?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.220
I'm excited.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.054
We'll have a good time.

25:22.054 --> 25:22.889
>> CHANDI: I'm excited, too.

25:22.889 --> 25:23.890
Okay.

25:23.890 --> 25:24.724
>> CAITLYN: Candis, are you

25:24.724 --> 25:25.725
ready to go?

25:25.725 --> 25:26.593
>> CANDIS: I am so ready to go.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.594
>> CAITLYN: Okay, good.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.595
I apologize for the slow start.

25:28.595 --> 25:29.395
>> JEN: It's all exciting.

25:29.395 --> 25:30.329
>> JENNY: It's not your fault.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.330
>> CAITLYN: It's not...

25:31.330 --> 25:32.331
Well, it is. (muttering)

25:32.331 --> 25:33.265
>> JENNY: Well, okay.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.100
Maybe it's your fault.

25:34.100 --> 25:34.967
>> JEN: What are you talking

25:34.967 --> 25:35.968
about? Completely.

25:35.968 --> 25:36.969
>> CAITLYN: You're wrong.

25:36.969 --> 25:37.870
>> JENNY: It's because you're so

25:37.870 --> 25:38.871
gorgeous, that's it.

25:38.871 --> 25:39.872
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, that's ex...

25:39.872 --> 25:40.873
Is that what it is? Okay.

25:40.873 --> 25:41.874
>> JENNY: Yeah.

25:41.874 --> 25:42.709
>> CAITLYN: There it is.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.310
>> JENNY: Oh, my freaking God.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.144
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yay!

25:45.144 --> 25:46.145
We have our camper!

25:46.145 --> 25:46.979
>> JEN: That's like...

25:46.979 --> 25:47.814
That's like a tour bus.

25:47.814 --> 25:48.648
>> CAITLYN: The fun part about a

25:48.648 --> 25:49.916
road trip is that everybody's

25:49.916 --> 25:52.018
kind of forced to all be

25:52.018 --> 25:53.185
together, you know?

25:53.185 --> 25:54.520
Nobody's going anywhere.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.489
And all the girls, I've noticed,

25:57.489 --> 25:58.490
are so excited about the trip,

25:58.490 --> 25:59.491
'cause they've all transitioned

25:59.491 --> 26:00.492
a long time ago.

26:00.492 --> 26:01.661
They're very rarely ever in a

26:01.661 --> 26:02.962
group with nothing but, you

26:02.962 --> 26:03.963
know, trans women.

26:03.963 --> 26:04.964
Are we ready?!

26:04.964 --> 26:05.965
>> JENNY: We're ready!

26:05.965 --> 26:06.799
>> RONDA: We're about to start

26:06.799 --> 26:07.800
moving.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.801
>> CAITLYN: Fire this big...

26:08.801 --> 26:09.802
(cheering)

26:09.802 --> 26:11.804
>> COURTNEY: Viva la road trip.

26:11.804 --> 26:12.639
>> CAITLYN: We're officially in

26:12.639 --> 26:13.640
a paparazzi-free zone.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.641
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.407
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's following

26:15.407 --> 26:16.408
us.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.243
>> JENNY: * 100 transgender

26:17.243 --> 26:18.244
Women on the wall

26:18.244 --> 26:19.245
* 100 transgender women

26:19.245 --> 26:20.246
On the wall

26:20.246 --> 26:21.247
Take one down... *

26:21.247 --> 26:22.248
(laughter, Ronda whoops)

26:22.248 --> 26:24.250
>> RONDA: This is fun.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.384
>> JEN: Had you ever met any

26:25.384 --> 26:27.453
trans women before Caitlyn?

26:27.453 --> 26:28.454
>> RONDA: Nope, and it was so

26:28.454 --> 26:30.522
great when I found out.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.458
>> JEN: Yeah?

26:32.458 --> 26:33.826
One time, you called me and

26:33.826 --> 26:34.761
said, "Hey, well, what are you

26:34.761 --> 26:35.427
doing?"

26:35.427 --> 26:36.362
I'm like, "Nothing."

26:36.362 --> 26:37.529
And you're like, "Well, do you

26:37.529 --> 26:38.564
want to come over for a glass of

26:38.564 --> 26:39.365
wine?"

26:39.365 --> 26:40.667
And I was like, "Yeah, of

26:40.667 --> 26:41.467
course."

26:41.467 --> 26:43.670
And I'm thinking, oh, no.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.337
He's not gonna... hit on me?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.472
(laughing)

26:46.472 --> 26:50.242
Literally changed my life.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.510
Caitlyn told me her story that

26:51.510 --> 26:53.780
night, after a couple glasses of

26:53.780 --> 26:54.947
wine.

26:54.947 --> 26:55.748
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

26:55.748 --> 26:56.482
>> RONDA: Because we all have

26:56.482 --> 26:57.750
our issues and our problems.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.685
And I'm like, "No, no, you don't

26:58.685 --> 26:59.686
even want to hear mine.

26:59.686 --> 27:00.386
Like, mine are...

27:00.386 --> 27:01.688
No. Mine are just, like, way too

27:01.688 --> 27:03.355
much for anyone to listen to."

27:03.355 --> 27:04.190
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.692
>> RONDA: And... she kind of

27:05.692 --> 27:06.693
trumped mine.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.527
I'm like, "Really?"

27:08.527 --> 27:09.696
>> CAITLYN: And the reason I

27:09.696 --> 27:13.165
came out to Ronda, um...

27:13.165 --> 27:14.566
good shopper.

27:14.566 --> 27:15.802
(laughter)

27:15.802 --> 27:16.969
(Courtney speaks indistinctly)

27:16.969 --> 27:18.104
>> CAITLYN: I needed help.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.239
I couldn't... I can't shop.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.473
>> RONDA: Who wants vino?

27:21.473 --> 27:22.408
Raise your hand.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.710
(whoops)

27:23.710 --> 27:24.711
>> CAITLYN: Oh, there you go.

27:24.711 --> 27:25.477
>> RONDA: Okay, I'll get you a

27:25.477 --> 27:26.145
glass.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.914
>> CHANDI: Thanks, Ronda.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.049
>> RONDA: I'm a party starter.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.250
Cheers.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.719
Here's to the road trip.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.754
>> CHANDI: Road trip.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.123
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

27:37.123 --> 27:39.325
*

27:40.927 --> 27:42.061
>> COURTNEY: Look at all her

27:42.061 --> 27:43.562
color variations in her hair.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.731
Unbelievable.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.265
>> JEN: Is that all natural?

27:46.265 --> 27:47.099
>> CANDIS: It's all natural,

27:47.099 --> 27:47.767
yeah.

27:47.767 --> 27:48.567
>> JEN: You want to keep it,

27:48.567 --> 27:49.268
lock your door at night.

27:49.268 --> 27:49.936
Lock your door at night.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.103
>> COURTNEY: I will come in and

27:51.103 --> 27:52.604
just... I will buzz off the

27:52.604 --> 27:53.605
bottom chunk.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.574
>> CAITLYN: Oh...

27:58.510 --> 27:59.746
>> CANDIS: Let's show...

27:59.746 --> 28:00.379
I'll show my butt.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.580
>> RONDA: Why don't you put 'em

28:01.580 --> 28:02.314
out the window?

28:02.314 --> 28:03.549
I'm just gonna spank your ass.

28:03.549 --> 28:04.616
>> CANDIS: I'm gonna do it.

28:04.616 --> 28:05.617
Ready?

28:05.617 --> 28:06.853
Ow!

28:06.853 --> 28:07.987
(glass shattering)

28:07.987 --> 28:09.255
(screams)

28:09.255 --> 28:11.758
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.192
>> RONDA: No.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.193
>> CANDIS: Oh, you spanked the

28:14.193 --> 28:15.494
window out of the car.

28:15.494 --> 28:16.628
>> CAITLYN: What the hell have

28:16.628 --> 28:17.496
you done?

28:17.496 --> 28:18.831
>> CANDIS: I don't know!

28:18.831 --> 28:20.833
The emergency exit fell out.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.168
We have fresh air now, Cait.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.535
That's why we did it.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.370
>> RONDA: Yeah.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.104
>> CAITLYN: Oh, you did it for

28:25.104 --> 28:25.772
my benefit?

28:25.772 --> 28:26.538
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.507
(whooping)

28:33.445 --> 28:34.881
>> RONDA: Are we a third of the

28:34.881 --> 28:35.882
way?

28:35.882 --> 28:37.784
>> CAITLYN: Nah... maybe about a

28:37.784 --> 28:39.151
third of the way, yeah.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.252
Jenny, where the hell are you

28:40.252 --> 28:40.987
going?

28:40.987 --> 28:41.653
(Ronda laughs)

28:41.653 --> 28:42.421
>> RONDA: This is like a '70s

28:42.421 --> 28:43.555
ad.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.223
>> CAITLYN: Look at you.

28:44.223 --> 28:44.891
Look what you found.

28:44.891 --> 28:45.657
>> CANDIS: Poppy.

28:45.657 --> 28:46.458
>> JENNY: A California poppy.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.359
>> CAITLYN: This is a poppy?

28:47.359 --> 28:48.627
>> RONDA: I didn't get a rose.

28:48.627 --> 28:49.796
>> JENNY: Yeah, that's right.

28:49.796 --> 28:50.429
Oh, it's just for us

28:50.429 --> 28:51.263
trans girls.

28:51.263 --> 28:51.931
You get that one.

28:51.931 --> 28:52.598
>> RONDA (laughing): Oh...

28:52.598 --> 28:53.800
>> CANDIS: You get the cis rose.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.600
>> RONDA: What, 'cause I'm a

28:54.600 --> 28:55.401
cis?

28:55.401 --> 28:55.902
>> CANDIS: I know.

28:55.902 --> 28:56.568
>> RONDA: So here you go.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.303
Here, take advantage of it while

28:57.303 --> 28:57.804
you can.

28:57.804 --> 28:58.537
>> CANDIS: Trying to yuk it up

28:58.537 --> 28:59.038
while we can.

28:59.038 --> 28:59.839
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

28:59.839 --> 29:00.840
All right, everybody just pile

29:00.840 --> 29:02.074
back on the bus.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.275
Let's get this show on the road.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.010
>> JEN: Let's get this party

29:04.010 --> 29:05.978
started.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.181
>> CAITLYN: I'm sure you've

29:09.181 --> 29:10.116
heard a lot of stories.

29:10.116 --> 29:10.950
>> CHANDI: I've heard plenty of

29:10.950 --> 29:11.683
stories.

29:11.683 --> 29:12.351
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.252
>> CHANDI: Plenty of stories.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.854
Working with young people has

29:14.854 --> 29:16.588
really given me a lot of drive,

29:16.588 --> 29:17.389
because their lives are just...

29:17.389 --> 29:18.090
>> CAITLYN: Now, is this just

29:18.090 --> 29:19.258
trans youth or gay...

29:19.258 --> 29:20.626
>> CHANDI: This is trans and

29:20.626 --> 29:21.894
gender nonconforming youth.

29:21.894 --> 29:22.962
>> CAITLYN: Gotcha.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.463
What's the big issue?

29:24.463 --> 29:26.098
>> CHANDI: They're homeless and

29:26.098 --> 29:27.834
they're unemployed, so it's just

29:27.834 --> 29:29.001
gonna take a lot more.

29:29.001 --> 29:29.902
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

29:29.902 --> 29:30.702
>> JEN: I think if I was to

29:30.702 --> 29:31.737
focus on one area, it would be,

29:31.737 --> 29:32.972
like, entry-level jobs.

29:32.972 --> 29:33.840
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.573
>> JEN: Just have... so that

29:34.573 --> 29:35.441
these girls have some

29:35.441 --> 29:36.508
alternative if they want it.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.176
>> CHANDI: Right.

29:37.176 --> 29:37.944
>> CAITLYN: Don't... a lot of

29:37.944 --> 29:40.246
times, they can make more not

29:40.246 --> 29:43.249
working... with social programs

29:43.249 --> 29:44.851
than they actually can with an

29:44.851 --> 29:46.853
entry-level job.

29:46.853 --> 29:47.619
>> JENNY: I'd say the great

29:47.619 --> 29:48.487
majority of people who are

29:48.487 --> 29:49.856
getting help are getting help

29:49.856 --> 29:50.890
'cause they need help.

29:50.890 --> 29:51.657
>> CAITLYN: But you don't want

29:51.657 --> 29:53.559
people to get totally dependent

29:53.559 --> 29:54.560
on it.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.862
That's when they get in trouble.

29:55.862 --> 29:56.963
"Why should I work?

29:56.963 --> 29:58.397
You know, I got a few bucks.

29:58.397 --> 30:02.401
I got my... my room paid for."

30:02.401 --> 30:03.903
>> JENNY: Now I'm worried.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.237
Caitlyn has every right to be

30:05.237 --> 30:06.638
just as conservative as she

30:06.638 --> 30:07.639
chooses.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.941
But many transgender men and

30:08.941 --> 30:10.442
women need social programs to

30:10.442 --> 30:11.911
survive, and that's nothing to

30:11.911 --> 30:12.979
be ashamed of.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.581
Living in the bubble is an

30:15.581 --> 30:17.816
impediment to understanding

30:17.816 --> 30:19.151
other people.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.152
If Cait's gonna be a

30:20.152 --> 30:21.687
spokesperson for our community,

30:21.687 --> 30:22.788
this is something she's gonna

30:22.788 --> 30:24.756
have to understand.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.196
(women laughing)

30:30.196 --> 30:31.330
>> RONDA: What do you think

30:31.330 --> 30:32.664
about the whole...

30:32.664 --> 30:35.001
Candis and Caitlyn...

30:35.001 --> 30:36.502
>> COURTNEY: They're not sitting

30:36.502 --> 30:37.870
by each other.

30:37.870 --> 30:38.670
>> RONDA: No, but she gave her a

30:38.670 --> 30:39.838
big hug when they came.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.807
When I talked to her about it,

30:41.807 --> 30:43.842
she... it's not like she

30:43.842 --> 30:45.011
blushes, but she's like, "Oh,

30:45.011 --> 30:46.378
stop! Stop!

30:46.378 --> 30:48.047
Let's stop talking about it."

30:48.047 --> 30:48.948
>> COURTNEY: I know, but she's

30:48.948 --> 30:49.882
probably nervous.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.117
>> RONDA: Does she even know

30:51.117 --> 30:52.451
that we're on the same...

30:52.451 --> 30:53.819
>> COURTNEY: No, she has no idea

30:53.819 --> 30:54.620
we're here.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.854
'Cause Candis is there and

30:55.854 --> 30:57.356
she's, like, doesn't know...

30:57.356 --> 30:58.257
You know, like, when you like

30:58.257 --> 30:59.025
someone and you have that

30:59.025 --> 30:59.892
electricity?

30:59.892 --> 31:00.692
>> RONDA: I'm trying to make eye

31:00.692 --> 31:01.627
contact with her and she's not

31:01.627 --> 31:02.694
looking.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.429
>> CANDIS: But they didn't

31:03.429 --> 31:04.096
say...

31:04.096 --> 31:05.131
>> CAITLYN: Oh, come on.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.165
(Ronda laughs)

31:06.165 --> 31:07.566
Both of you, turn around.

31:07.566 --> 31:08.834
(laughter)

31:08.834 --> 31:10.469
Our cis girls, just leave 'em up

31:10.469 --> 31:11.470
there.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.138
>> RONDA: See?

31:12.138 --> 31:12.804
>> COURTNEY: Oh, see?

31:12.804 --> 31:13.572
She's like, "Leave 'em up

31:13.572 --> 31:16.775
there."

31:16.775 --> 31:17.944
(birds singing)

31:17.944 --> 31:19.011
>> CAITLYN: We made it!

31:19.011 --> 31:19.678
It's the first stop.

31:19.678 --> 31:20.179
>> CHANDI: Yay.

31:20.179 --> 31:20.846
>> CAITLYN: Everybody out.

31:20.846 --> 31:21.513
>> CANDIS: No. (laughs)

31:21.513 --> 31:22.181
>> CAITLYN: Go ahead, baby.

31:22.181 --> 31:22.848
>> JENNY: Oh, wow, it's

31:22.848 --> 31:23.349
beautiful.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.016
>> CAITLYN: Go ahead.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.351
>> COURTNEY: Look at how

31:25.351 --> 31:27.019
there's, like, a little house in

31:27.019 --> 31:28.254
the woods.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.190
Isn't that crazy?

31:31.190 --> 31:32.691
>> CAITLYN: All right!

31:32.691 --> 31:34.193
Look at this.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.594
>> JENNY: Wow, it's gorgeous.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.329
>> JEN: Oh, my goodness.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.030
>> JENNY: It's beautiful.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.966
(Jen gasps, shrieks, laughs)

31:39.966 --> 31:40.732
>> CAITLYN: I brought the moose

31:40.732 --> 31:41.500
in for you.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.534
>> COURTNEY: Oh, my God.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.435
Come on.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.603
>> JEN: It's screaming.

31:44.603 --> 31:45.471
>> COURTNEY: Touch it.

31:45.471 --> 31:46.205
>> JENNY: Screaming at you when

31:46.205 --> 31:47.206
you walk in the... Touch it?

31:47.206 --> 31:47.974
>> RONDA: Ew, that's just

31:47.974 --> 31:48.740
creepy. I can't look, just...

31:48.740 --> 31:49.508
>> CAITLYN: Don't touch it, it

31:49.508 --> 31:50.176
could bite.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.177
>> JEN: What did it feel like?

31:51.177 --> 31:52.244
>> JENNY: It's like a...

31:52.244 --> 31:53.145
>> CANDIS: Wow, it's so

31:53.145 --> 31:53.980
gorgeous.

31:53.980 --> 31:54.746
>> CAITLYN: Now, Ronda, are you

31:54.746 --> 31:55.481
cooking?

31:55.481 --> 31:56.548
(laughter)

31:56.548 --> 31:58.717
>> RONDA: Uh... not tonight.

31:58.717 --> 31:59.818
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

31:59.818 --> 32:00.987
>> RONDA: I'm sorry.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.388
'Cause this is my vacation,

32:02.388 --> 32:03.389
remember?

32:03.389 --> 32:04.390
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, right.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.124
(Ronda laughs)

32:05.124 --> 32:06.025
>> RONDA: Well, don't say "Oh,

32:06.025 --> 32:07.659
right."

32:07.659 --> 32:09.295
>> JENNY: Let's sit out here.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.464
>> CHANDI: Oh...

32:12.464 --> 32:14.233
>> JENNY: So this is California.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.301
Beautiful view.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.568
>> CAITLYN: It's kind of cold,

32:16.568 --> 32:17.569
yeah.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.205
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.372
>> CAITLYN: Now we're talking.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.740
>> CHANDI: Thanks, Ronda.

32:21.740 --> 32:22.674
>> CAITLYN: The Santa Cruz

32:22.674 --> 32:23.675
mountains.

32:23.675 --> 32:24.410
>> CANDIS: That's beautiful,

32:24.410 --> 32:25.277
right?

32:25.277 --> 32:26.178
I love the smell.

32:26.178 --> 32:26.845
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it smells

32:26.845 --> 32:27.746
really nice.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.348
>> RONDA: Caitlyn's finally out.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.049
>> CAITLYN: I'm out!

32:30.049 --> 32:30.849
Yeah, this is the furthest I've

32:30.849 --> 32:32.118
been away from home.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.152
Yay!

32:33.152 --> 32:34.086
(women whooping)

32:34.086 --> 32:35.121
>> JENNY: Bravo.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.022
>> COURTNEY: Cheers.

32:36.022 --> 32:36.755
>> CANDIS: Cheers.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.124
Wow.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.258
>> CAITLYN: To be with all these

32:39.258 --> 32:42.128
girls who are so accepting of me

32:42.128 --> 32:44.363
and who I am is probably the

32:44.363 --> 32:45.397
most freeing thing I've ever

32:45.397 --> 32:46.665
done in my life.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.800
Just to be out there... it

32:48.800 --> 32:50.069
makes me really look forward to

32:50.069 --> 32:51.370
the future.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.738
>> CHANDI: So how does it feel?

32:52.738 --> 32:54.706
>> CAITLYN: It feels free, baby.

32:54.706 --> 32:55.641
>> CHANDI: Right, right.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.308
>> CAITLYN: Free.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.409
To be here with all of you is

32:57.409 --> 32:58.610
nothing but good.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.445
(Chandi chuckles)

32:59.445 --> 33:00.146
>> JEN: Feeling good.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.647
>> CHANDI: All good, all good.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.915
>> CAITLYN: Nice.

33:03.915 --> 33:07.086
(insects trilling)

33:07.086 --> 33:08.154
Looks like somebody already

33:08.154 --> 33:09.055
parked down here.

33:09.055 --> 33:09.721
Was that you?

33:09.721 --> 33:10.456
>> CANDIS: Yeah, it's the...

33:10.456 --> 33:11.290
>> COURTNEY AND CAITLYN: ...it's

33:11.290 --> 33:12.291
the smallest room.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.125
>> CANDIS: Nobody wants to be

33:13.125 --> 33:13.792
here.

33:13.792 --> 33:14.460
>> CAITLYN: Actually, it is.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.127
It's very nice.

33:15.127 --> 33:15.827
>> JEN: This is the room I

33:15.827 --> 33:16.595
would've chosen, just for the

33:16.595 --> 33:17.096
record.

33:17.096 --> 33:17.763
>> RONDA: We'll get the

33:17.763 --> 33:18.597
honeymoon suite.

33:18.597 --> 33:19.765
>> COURTNEY: This is my bed.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.600
Get off my bed!

33:21.600 --> 33:23.335
>> RONDA: Oh. Oh, you fancy...

33:23.335 --> 33:24.370
>> CAITLYN: What are you guys

33:24.370 --> 33:25.371
doing?

33:25.371 --> 33:26.538
I guess you girls have taken

33:26.538 --> 33:27.406
this room?

33:27.406 --> 33:28.207
>> COURTNEY: Well, no, no, no,

33:28.207 --> 33:28.874
no, no.

33:28.874 --> 33:29.608
>> CAITLYN: There's only one

33:29.608 --> 33:30.276
bed.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.243
>> RONDA: There's zero...

33:31.243 --> 33:31.977
>> CAITLYN: We had two separate

33:31.977 --> 33:32.711
beds downstairs for you, if you

33:32.711 --> 33:33.712
wanted 'em.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.546
>> COURTNEY: That does not sound

33:34.546 --> 33:35.214
good.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.648
>> CAITLYN: Follow me.

33:36.648 --> 33:37.449
>> COURTNEY: Down there?

33:37.449 --> 33:38.284
>> CAITLYN: Hello!

33:38.284 --> 33:41.153
Ronda.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.654
The guesthouse.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.655
>> JENNY: Oh, my God.

33:43.655 --> 33:44.590
>> COURTNEY: Wait, no.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.558
>> RONDA: Is that really?

33:46.558 --> 33:47.493
>> CAITLYN: Here's the deal:

33:47.493 --> 33:48.960
we're one short down there.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.096
I think you should stay up here.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.297
>> RONDA: What, me?

33:51.297 --> 33:52.098
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

33:52.098 --> 33:52.898
Okay, everybody's got a room

33:52.898 --> 33:53.699
now.

33:53.699 --> 33:54.366
>> RONDA: Can I just say

33:54.366 --> 33:55.834
something? Caitlyn.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.769
You told me this was a vacation.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.105
>> CAITLYN: You're doing fine.

33:59.105 --> 33:59.771
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:59.771 --> 34:00.539
>> RONDA: Oh, great.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.340
I'm gonna hobble down here to

34:01.340 --> 34:02.141
the bathroom in the middle of

34:02.141 --> 34:03.175
the night?

34:03.175 --> 34:04.310
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.811
(Ronda sighs)

34:07.179 --> 34:08.747
(crickets chirping, owl hoots)

34:08.747 --> 34:10.916
(Courtney whoops)

34:10.916 --> 34:11.850
>> COURTNEY: Chandi, we'll meet

34:11.850 --> 34:12.818
you in the hot tub.

34:12.818 --> 34:13.619
>> CANDIS: I'll see you in the

34:13.619 --> 34:14.120
hot tub.

34:14.120 --> 34:14.786
>> JENNY: Okay.

34:14.786 --> 34:15.754
Bathing suit or naked?

34:15.754 --> 34:16.455
>> JEN: I'm gonna wear my

34:16.455 --> 34:16.955
bathing suit.

34:16.955 --> 34:17.756
>> JENNY: You're gonna wear your

34:17.756 --> 34:18.257
bathing suit?

34:18.257 --> 34:18.990
>> JEN: You can do whatever you

34:18.990 --> 34:19.491
want.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.326
>> JENNY: Well, it'll be kind of

34:20.326 --> 34:21.127
awkward if I'm... if I'm...

34:21.127 --> 34:21.960
>> JEN: Not at all.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.828
>> JENNY: ...if I'm not wearing

34:22.828 --> 34:23.629
any... I'm gonna wear a bathing

34:23.629 --> 34:24.296
suit.

34:24.296 --> 34:25.131
If you're gonna wear a bathing

34:25.131 --> 34:25.897
suit, I'll wear a bathing suit.

34:25.897 --> 34:26.565
>> JEN: Okay.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.399
>> JENNY: I won't be the only

34:27.399 --> 34:29.468
trans girl... naked in the...

34:29.468 --> 34:31.137
So I'll put on a thing.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.038
>> JEN: Okay.

34:35.607 --> 34:36.842
>> COURTNEY: It's a little hot,

34:36.842 --> 34:38.210
so I'm gonna let myself in a

34:38.210 --> 34:39.811
little bit slow, 'cause it's,

34:39.811 --> 34:41.713
like, lobsters cooking.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.614
>> CANDIS: Oh.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.315
>> RONDA: How hot is it?

34:43.315 --> 34:44.150
>> COURTNEY: Hottish.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.351
>> RONDA: It's 103.

34:45.351 --> 34:46.718
>> JENNY: Cait, have you been

34:46.718 --> 34:47.753
swimming?

34:47.753 --> 34:48.554
>> CAITLYN: What's that?

34:48.554 --> 34:49.355
>> JENNY: Have you been swimming

34:49.355 --> 34:50.422
in your own bathing suit yet?

34:50.422 --> 34:51.223
>> CAITLYN: No.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.023
Well, I've been in the bathing

34:52.023 --> 34:52.991
suit, but I haven't gone

34:52.991 --> 34:53.659
swimming yet.

34:53.659 --> 34:54.493
>> JENNY: You haven't been in

34:54.493 --> 34:55.327
the, in the pool?

34:55.327 --> 34:56.162
>> CAITLYN: No, I haven't even

34:56.162 --> 34:56.828
been in the pool.

34:56.828 --> 34:57.729
It's too damn cold right now.

34:57.729 --> 34:58.630
>> JENNY: It's a really...

34:58.630 --> 34:59.365
For me, anyway, it was an

34:59.365 --> 35:00.399
incredible moment when I was

35:00.399 --> 35:01.333
like...

35:01.333 --> 35:02.301
>> CAITLYN: To actually go

35:02.301 --> 35:02.968
swimming?

35:02.968 --> 35:03.935
To be honest with you, that'll

35:03.935 --> 35:04.603
happen at some point.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.271
I'm in no rush.

35:05.271 --> 35:05.937
>> JENNY: It will.

35:05.937 --> 35:06.438
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.038
I'm in no rush.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.374
Yeah.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.375
>> JENNY: I hear you.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.376
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.378
This process of coming out

35:12.378 --> 35:13.979
doesn't happen overnight.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.314
There are so many hurdles to

35:15.314 --> 35:16.648
overcome.

35:16.648 --> 35:17.983
Every day, it seems like, you

35:17.983 --> 35:20.652
know, what about a

35:20.652 --> 35:22.654
"beijing-thuit"?

35:22.654 --> 35:23.655
(spits)

35:23.655 --> 35:24.656
>> PRODUCER: Bathing suit.

35:24.656 --> 35:25.657
>> CAITLYN: Bathing suit.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.326
See, I can't even say it.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.660
It's hard for it to just, to

35:28.660 --> 35:30.329
come out.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.664
Saying, "A bathing suit."

35:32.664 --> 35:33.665
But, you know, that's where I

35:33.665 --> 35:34.666
got to get, and that's gonna

35:34.666 --> 35:36.202
take time.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.469
>> CHANDI: Can I say how amazing

35:37.469 --> 35:38.470
everybody looks in their

35:38.470 --> 35:39.471
swimsuits?

35:39.471 --> 35:40.472
(Candis whoops)

35:40.472 --> 35:41.473
Okay?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.108
(indistinct chatter)

35:43.108 --> 35:44.109
>> RONDA: We're overflowing.

35:44.109 --> 35:46.111
>> JENNY: It's all these boobs.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.112
>> JEN: (laughs) It's all the

35:47.112 --> 35:48.113
boobs.

35:48.113 --> 35:52.117
(laughter)

35:52.117 --> 35:55.120
>> CAITLYN: All right.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.121
Little red light's on, camera's

35:56.121 --> 35:57.122
working.

35:57.122 --> 35:59.458
Jenny: "Come on, let's get in

35:59.458 --> 36:00.792
the hot tub."

36:00.792 --> 36:02.228
I don't think I'm ready for

36:02.228 --> 36:03.229
that.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.230
You have to realize, these girls

36:04.230 --> 36:06.232
transitioned years and years and

36:06.232 --> 36:07.866
years ago.

36:07.866 --> 36:08.867
Um...

36:08.867 --> 36:11.237
I just don't know if I'm ready

36:11.237 --> 36:13.872
to expose myself like that.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.241
Maybe down the line, I'll feel

36:15.241 --> 36:16.542
more comfortable with myself,

36:16.542 --> 36:19.245
but right now...

36:19.245 --> 36:20.546
I just can't see myself doing

36:20.546 --> 36:22.881
it.

36:22.881 --> 36:23.882
Bedtime.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.885
All right.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.887
(golf ball pings)

36:28.887 --> 36:30.889
Wow.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.558
It's just absolutely gorgeous.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.260
I love a great view.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.263
To me, a view is like freedom.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.265
So, uh, Caitlyn being out for

36:39.265 --> 36:41.567
the first time is wonderful.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.569
Well, the big question now is:

36:43.569 --> 36:45.271
does it make a difference...

36:45.271 --> 36:46.905
swinging a golf club...

36:46.905 --> 36:48.274
with boobs or not?

36:48.274 --> 36:50.909
Will I still be free enough to

36:50.909 --> 36:52.911
be able to swing the golf club?

36:52.911 --> 36:53.912
But I think in the putting

36:53.912 --> 36:54.913
department, I think it's gonna

36:54.913 --> 36:56.282
be very good, 'cause you can

36:56.282 --> 36:57.583
just kind of latch onto those

36:57.583 --> 36:59.285
little babies under your arm,

36:59.285 --> 37:00.586
right here, and get a nice

37:00.586 --> 37:01.920
putting stroke going.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.655
So I'm optimistic about the

37:03.655 --> 37:04.656
future, 'cause I needed help on

37:04.656 --> 37:07.659
my putting.

37:07.659 --> 37:08.827
(Caitlyn whoops)

37:08.827 --> 37:10.161
>> JENNY: So are you enjoying

37:10.161 --> 37:11.162
the ride?

37:11.162 --> 37:12.163
>> JEN: Yeah, of course, of

37:12.163 --> 37:14.099
course, it's...

37:14.099 --> 37:15.100
I don't know, I kind of almost

37:15.100 --> 37:16.101
take it for granted.

37:16.101 --> 37:17.102
I spend so much time with trans

37:17.102 --> 37:18.437
women already, but Caitlyn's joy

37:18.437 --> 37:19.438
is kind of contagious.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.439
Like that feeling when you're

37:20.439 --> 37:21.440
first out and everything is new.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.441
>> JENNY: Yeah, yeah.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.109
Yeah, no.

37:24.109 --> 37:25.110
>> CAITLYN: Oh, that was great,

37:25.110 --> 37:26.778
actually.

37:26.778 --> 37:27.779
>> JENNY: So we're going to HRC

37:27.779 --> 37:28.780
today.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.781
>> JEN: Mm-hmm.

37:29.781 --> 37:30.782
>> JENNY: Right?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.117
To see these trans women, many

37:32.117 --> 37:33.785
of whom have done sex work and

37:33.785 --> 37:35.120
who are gonna talk in a very

37:35.120 --> 37:37.122
vulnerable and personal way

37:37.122 --> 37:39.124
about that, and Cait needs to

37:39.124 --> 37:41.793
learn what the risks are to the

37:41.793 --> 37:42.794
community.

37:42.794 --> 37:43.795
>> JEN: Yeah.

37:43.795 --> 37:44.796
>> JENNY: You know, if Cait

37:44.796 --> 37:46.131
emerges from this whole thing

37:46.131 --> 37:47.466
thinking that, you know, that

37:47.466 --> 37:48.467
it's... that womanhood is a

37:48.467 --> 37:49.801
party, or that being... that

37:49.801 --> 37:50.802
being trans...

37:50.802 --> 37:52.471
I mean, and we, you know, she's

37:52.471 --> 37:54.473
so happy, and it's so... it's so

37:54.473 --> 37:56.141
moving to see her so elated, you

37:56.141 --> 37:57.142
know?

37:57.142 --> 37:58.477
Um, but it's also, I'm afraid

37:58.477 --> 37:59.478
people will think that, you

37:59.478 --> 38:01.146
know, it's-it's just, you know,

38:01.146 --> 38:02.881
that... it's all about makeup

38:02.881 --> 38:04.215
and hair.

38:04.215 --> 38:05.551
And yet there are all these

38:05.551 --> 38:07.553
trans women out there who are in

38:07.553 --> 38:09.555
real danger.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.222
Transgender people often go

38:11.222 --> 38:12.223
through a kind of second

38:12.223 --> 38:13.224
adolescence.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.159
And when you first come out, you

38:14.159 --> 38:16.161
can really find yourself acting,

38:16.161 --> 38:18.163
you know, like a giddy teenager.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.831
The sad fact is that our

38:19.831 --> 38:22.501
community is in trouble.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.503
Caitlyn, she wants to be our

38:24.503 --> 38:26.505
savior, but most people don't

38:26.505 --> 38:28.173
have what she has, and she may

38:28.173 --> 38:28.840
be oblivious.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.841
>> JEN: I mean, that's why we're

38:29.841 --> 38:30.509
here.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.510
>> JENNY: She's-she's eager to

38:31.510 --> 38:32.511
learn, but, you know what,

38:32.511 --> 38:33.512
there are some times I'm not

38:33.512 --> 38:34.513
sure what... what gets through

38:34.513 --> 38:35.514
to her.

38:35.514 --> 38:39.485
>> JEN: Yeah.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.486
>> CAITLYN: Beautiful!

38:40.486 --> 38:42.988
Caitlyn is out.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.757
>> CAITLYN: I really haven't

38:45.757 --> 38:46.758
done anything to alter my voice.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.759
I know we talked about this last

38:47.759 --> 38:48.427
time.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.428
>> JEN: Right, yeah.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.429
>> CAITLYN: This is not what I

38:50.429 --> 38:51.430
looked like, okay?

38:51.430 --> 38:52.431
That's somewhat scary.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.432
But what I sound like...

38:53.432 --> 38:54.099
>> JEN: Mmm.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.100
>> CAITLYN: I've seen some trans

38:55.100 --> 38:56.101
people, they look great, and

38:56.101 --> 38:57.102
then they open up their mouth,

38:57.102 --> 38:58.103
and you go, "Oh, my God."

38:58.103 --> 38:58.770
>> JEN: Yeah.

38:58.770 --> 38:59.771
>> CAITLYN: I felt... I felt

38:59.771 --> 39:00.772
sorry for them, 'cause they

39:00.772 --> 39:01.773
were, you know, they had a real

39:01.773 --> 39:02.508
deep voice, you know?

39:02.508 --> 39:03.509
>> JEN: Yeah, I know girls like

39:03.509 --> 39:04.175
that.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.176
>> CAITLYN: And I went, "God, I

39:05.176 --> 39:06.177
don't want that for me."

39:06.177 --> 39:07.178
Because I do so much speaking.

39:07.178 --> 39:07.846
>> JEN: Mm-hmm.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.847
>> CAITLYN: You know, 'cause

39:08.847 --> 39:09.848
there's all sorts of options on

39:09.848 --> 39:10.516
that.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.517
>> JEN: Mm-hmm.

39:11.517 --> 39:12.518
>> CAITLYN: It's little things

39:12.518 --> 39:13.184
that get into your head.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.119
>> RONDA: We got to go.

39:14.119 --> 39:14.853
>> CAITLYN: Well, let's go.

39:14.853 --> 39:15.854
>> RONDA: Otherwise, we-we're

39:15.854 --> 39:16.522
gonna be late for the, um,

39:16.522 --> 39:17.523
meeting.

39:17.523 --> 39:18.189
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.190
>> JENNY: Do we need to bring

39:19.190 --> 39:19.858
our bags?

39:19.858 --> 39:20.792
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, actually, you

39:20.792 --> 39:21.527
know what the other good thing

39:21.527 --> 39:22.528
is?

39:22.528 --> 39:23.529
We get guys to carry our bags

39:23.529 --> 39:24.530
for us.

39:24.530 --> 39:28.099
(laughter)

39:28.099 --> 39:29.768
I want to kind of keep it

39:29.768 --> 39:30.769
low-key.

39:30.769 --> 39:31.770
I don't want to make, like, a

39:31.770 --> 39:32.771
big spectacle or anything like

39:32.771 --> 39:33.772
that.

39:33.772 --> 39:34.773
Keep it low-key.

39:34.773 --> 39:35.774
We're going in to the HRC place.

39:35.774 --> 39:38.444
Now, you work with them.

39:38.444 --> 39:39.445
>> JEN: Yeah, I do, so...

39:39.445 --> 39:40.446
>> CAITLYN: What would you like

39:40.446 --> 39:41.447
to accomplish?

39:41.447 --> 39:42.781
>> JEN: Primarily, just to hear

39:42.781 --> 39:43.782
these girls' stories.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.451
They're survivors of-of violence

39:45.451 --> 39:47.318
because they're trans.

39:47.318 --> 39:48.787
We don't want to reduce them to

39:48.787 --> 39:49.788
these traumas, you know?

39:49.788 --> 39:50.789
>> CAITLYN: Right.

39:50.789 --> 39:51.790
>> JEN: They're so much more

39:51.790 --> 39:52.791
than-than these things that

39:52.791 --> 39:53.792
they've suffered.

39:53.792 --> 39:54.793
But we also need to acknowledge

39:54.793 --> 39:55.794
what's happened...

39:55.794 --> 39:56.795
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, right.

39:56.795 --> 39:57.796
>> JEN: ...in order to lift the

39:57.796 --> 39:58.797
visibility of their stories.

39:58.797 --> 39:59.798
>> CAITLYN: I am so amped.

39:59.798 --> 40:00.799
>> JEN: Good. Good, I'm glad.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.768
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.005
>> JEN: Hi.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.006
>> MAN: We're ready to welcome

40:08.006 --> 40:08.674
you with open arms.

40:08.674 --> 40:09.675
>> JEN: Hi, I'm Jen.

40:09.675 --> 40:10.341
>> MAN: Welcome to the Human

40:10.341 --> 40:11.342
Rights Campaign-- just really

40:11.342 --> 40:12.010
carefully watch your step.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.011
>> JEN: All right, okay. Thanks.

40:13.011 --> 40:13.745
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.680
Nice to see you.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.681
Thank you for having us.

40:15.681 --> 40:16.682
>> MAN: Good to meet you.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.650
(Jen laughs giddily)

40:21.019 --> 40:22.353
>> CAITLYN: Is this your friend?

40:22.353 --> 40:23.689
>> ANGELICA: Yes. Hello,

40:23.689 --> 40:25.356
gorgeous, how are you?

40:25.356 --> 40:26.357
Can I get a hug?

40:26.357 --> 40:27.358
>> CAITLYN: How are you?

40:27.358 --> 40:29.027
>> ANGELICA: I'm awesome.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.361
>> CAITLYN: So nice to meet you.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.362
>> JAY: It's a pleasure to meet

40:31.362 --> 40:32.030
you. Thank you.

40:32.030 --> 40:32.931
>> ALISON: Hi, Alison Gill.

40:32.931 --> 40:33.699
It's nice to meet you.

40:33.699 --> 40:34.700
>> JENNY: I'll say it again, I'm

40:34.700 --> 40:36.034
so glad to be here at HRC.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.035
It's a pleasure.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.036
>> LAYA: Laya Monarez.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.037
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.038
>> BLOSSOM: I'm Blossom.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.039
>> JENNY: How are you, Blossom?

40:41.039 --> 40:41.707
That's a pretty...

40:41.707 --> 40:42.708
>> BLOSSOM: Nice to meet you.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.042
>> JENNY: Pleasure to meet you.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.478
>> JEN: Okay.

40:46.478 --> 40:47.979
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my gosh, where

40:47.979 --> 40:48.647
do we start?

40:48.647 --> 40:49.648
>> JAY: We're really happy to be

40:49.648 --> 40:50.982
here today, talking with you and

40:50.982 --> 40:52.651
talking about sort of the issues

40:52.651 --> 40:53.985
that the community faces.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.320
I mean, we're really honored to

40:55.320 --> 40:56.655
have some incredible advocates

40:56.655 --> 40:57.989
here, uh, today to talk about

40:57.989 --> 40:59.324
their personal stories.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.325
>> ALISON: You know, most people

41:00.325 --> 41:01.326
think that trans people are

41:01.326 --> 41:02.327
protected from discrimination

41:02.327 --> 41:03.729
across the country, and that's

41:03.729 --> 41:04.730
really not the case.

41:04.730 --> 41:05.731
And it can really lead to all

41:05.731 --> 41:07.065
sorts of problems.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.066
(others affirming)

41:08.066 --> 41:09.067
>> ANGELICA: I've been

41:09.067 --> 41:10.068
transitioning since I was 19.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.069
I still haven't been able to

41:11.069 --> 41:13.404
access what you've been able to

41:13.404 --> 41:15.073
access so quickly.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.742
When I first came out, I was

41:16.742 --> 41:18.409
fired from, like, four jobs in a

41:18.409 --> 41:20.078
row... once they found out I was

41:20.078 --> 41:22.080
trans, so I felt like I would

41:22.080 --> 41:24.750
never in my life choose to do

41:24.750 --> 41:26.752
sex work...

41:26.752 --> 41:27.753
but after being fired after so

41:27.753 --> 41:29.755
many jobs, what other choice did

41:29.755 --> 41:30.756
I have?

41:30.756 --> 41:32.423
>> WOMAN: Yeah, mm-hmm.

41:32.423 --> 41:33.424
>> JENNY: This type of

41:33.424 --> 41:34.425
discrimination is all too common

41:34.425 --> 41:36.094
in the workplace for trans

41:36.094 --> 41:37.095
women.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.764
We have to struggle to be

41:38.764 --> 41:40.766
employed, which is one reason

41:40.766 --> 41:42.100
why sex work is so prevalent in

41:42.100 --> 41:43.101
our community.

41:43.101 --> 41:44.770
For some transgender women, it's

41:44.770 --> 41:46.437
the only work that we can get.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.438
>> BLOSSOM: Whenever someone

41:47.438 --> 41:48.439
sees a transgender person, uh,

41:48.439 --> 41:49.440
the first thing they're gonna

41:49.440 --> 41:50.441
think is, "Oh, they're a

41:50.441 --> 41:51.109
prostitute."

41:51.109 --> 41:52.110
You know, I mean, it's sex work

41:52.110 --> 41:53.111
or whatever.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.112
But what people don't understand

41:54.112 --> 41:54.780
is...

41:54.780 --> 41:55.781
>> CAITLYN: Is that what they're

41:55.781 --> 41:56.447
gonna think of me?

41:56.447 --> 41:57.448
(laughter)

41:57.448 --> 41:58.116
>> ANGELICA: Not you, girl.

41:58.116 --> 41:58.950
>> BLOSSOM: Yeah, not you.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.185
>> CAITLYN: My God, all of a

42:00.185 --> 42:02.120
sudden-- shock.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.188
Wait a second.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.122
>> BLOSSOM: Yeah, but, see, what

42:04.122 --> 42:05.123
people don't understand is, the

42:05.123 --> 42:06.457
reason why some of us do turn to

42:06.457 --> 42:08.126
sex work is because people will

42:08.126 --> 42:09.127
not hire us.

42:09.127 --> 42:10.128
>> ALISON: Mmm, that's right.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.129
>> BLOSSOM: I'm gonna be honest.

42:11.129 --> 42:12.798
Caitlyn, when you came out, it

42:12.798 --> 42:14.465
was so mixed or whatever,

42:14.465 --> 42:16.467
because it seems like you have

42:16.467 --> 42:18.136
these transgender women of color

42:18.136 --> 42:19.805
who are going out here, and-and

42:19.805 --> 42:20.806
we're basically saying the same

42:20.806 --> 42:22.140
thing you were doing, and, like,

42:22.140 --> 42:23.141
nobody wanted to hear it.

42:23.141 --> 42:24.142
>> CAITLYN: No, okay, first of

42:24.142 --> 42:24.810
all...

42:24.810 --> 42:25.811
>> BLOSSOM: Nobody wanted to

42:25.811 --> 42:26.812
hear it.

42:26.812 --> 42:27.813
And, you know what I mean?

42:27.813 --> 42:28.814
And... you were... it was...

42:28.814 --> 42:29.815
it had something... (sighs)

42:29.815 --> 42:30.816
Let's just be real, it had

42:30.816 --> 42:31.817
something to do with your

42:31.817 --> 42:32.818
socio-economical status.

42:32.818 --> 42:35.821
(others affirming)

42:35.821 --> 42:36.822
>> CHANDI: It's not your

42:36.822 --> 42:38.489
problem, but it would be great

42:38.489 --> 42:39.490
if you would just step up and

42:39.490 --> 42:40.826
let the people who are doing

42:40.826 --> 42:42.493
wrong know that they're wrong.

42:42.493 --> 42:43.494
>> ALISON: Uh-huh.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.495
>> BLOSSOM: I definitely agree

42:44.495 --> 42:45.496
with that.

42:45.496 --> 42:46.497
You're up there.

42:46.497 --> 42:49.167
Come down and-and understand

42:49.167 --> 42:51.136
with everybody else.

43:00.646 --> 43:01.647
>> CAITLYN: Months and months

43:01.647 --> 43:02.648
ago...

43:02.648 --> 43:03.915
I thought, "How could I make a

43:03.915 --> 43:05.250
difference?"

43:05.250 --> 43:06.251
And I'm thinking about my

43:06.251 --> 43:08.920
family, and I struggled...

43:08.920 --> 43:10.922
Damn it.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.258
We're gonna go roller-skating.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.259
(woman whoops)

43:14.259 --> 43:15.260
>> CHANDI: Put a ring on it.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.261
>> CAITLYN: Ooh, wait a second,

43:16.261 --> 43:18.263
we got to get our legs.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.264
>> COURTNEY: Who's more

43:19.264 --> 43:21.266
attracted to men?

43:21.266 --> 43:22.267
>> JENNY: Is that a hand?

43:22.267 --> 43:23.268
>> CAITLYN: I don't know.

43:23.268 --> 43:24.269
You would feel so much more

43:24.269 --> 43:25.336
feminine if you were with a guy,

43:25.336 --> 43:26.337
you know?

43:26.337 --> 43:27.205
>> JEN: Wait, what?!

43:27.205 --> 43:28.339
>> CAITLYN: I can appreciate the

43:28.339 --> 43:30.341
male form.
