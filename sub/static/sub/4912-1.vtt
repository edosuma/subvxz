<i>Fears of a second
recession have caused panic</i>

00:24.323 --> 00:26.018
<i>in Europe's financial markets.</i>

00:26.225 --> 00:29.786
<i>The severity of this recession will
cause more pain before it ends.</i>

00:29.995 --> 00:32.122
<i>European Union
cannot bail out Greece.</i>

00:32.331 --> 00:33.730
<i>You've seen the
government of Spain coming out</i>

00:33.932 --> 00:35.627
<i>and saying we've had the same problem.</i>

00:35.834 --> 00:36.994
<i>Portugal says the same thing.</i>

00:37.102 --> 00:39.022
<i>There's some talk
that Italy could be in trouble.</i>

00:39.938 --> 00:42.964
<i>US intelligence officials
are growing more and more concerned</i>

00:43.175 --> 00:45.473
<i>that foreign operatives are surveilling
computer systems</i>

00:45.677 --> 00:47.440
<i>that control America's infrastructure.</i>

00:47.646 --> 00:48.874
<i>It's now clear</i>

00:49.081 --> 00:52.050
<i>this cyber threat is one of the most
serious national security challenges</i>

00:52.251 --> 00:53.582
<i>we face as a nation.</i>

00:53.719 --> 00:55.846
<i>Then it might
have the ability to go in and cripple</i>

00:55.954 --> 00:58.855
<i>financial networks, nuclear plants,
chemical plants,</i>

00:59.058 --> 01:01.424

01:01.627 --> 01:02.958
<i>North Korea has now joined</i>

01:03.062 --> 01:05.120
<i>the Pacific Rim Cooperation Organization.</i>

01:05.297 --> 01:06.457
<i>The group's formation is</i>

01:06.565 --> 01:09.728
<i>a clearer warning that further intervention
in the region by the U.S.</i>

01:09.835 --> 01:11.894
<i>and its allies will not be tolerated.</i>

01:12.071 --> 01:13.698
<i>A South Korean TV station</i>

<i>reports that North Korean leader
Kim Jong II</i>

<i>Promoted from a nobody
to high political and military office.</i>

01:25.951 --> 01:28.579
<i>As a kid, he was really loved by his father</i>

01:28.687 --> 01:30.621
<i>because he had a fit of anger.</i>

01:30.722 --> 01:33.953
<i>He will now lead
the world's fourth largest army.</i>

01:34.059 --> 01:36.687

01:36.795 --> 01:39.263
<i>Rebels were planning to increase
their violent campaign</i>

<i>as the country prepares

01:43.035 --> 01:44.468
<i>Russia's pouring more troops</i>

01:44.570 --> 01:46.299

01:46.405 --> 01:47.394
<i>Ex-Soviet Georgia</i>

01:47.539 --> 01:50.030

between Russia and the West.</i>

<i>We're working to reset

01:55.114 --> 01:56.604
<i>U.S. soldiers are being deployed</i>

<i>South Asia and the Korean peninsula.</i>

02:01.153 --> 02:04.088
<i>Critics suggest

02:04.256 --> 02:05.621
<i>South Korea accused the North</i>

02:05.724 --> 02:08.352
<i>of firing a torpedo at its Cheonan warship.</i>

<i>South Koreans continue to protest</i>

02:10.529 --> 02:13.157
<i>against North Korea's attack
on Yeonpyeong Island.</i>

02:13.265 --> 02:16.029
<i>Some are calling the
attack a crime against humanity.</i>

02:16.168 --> 02:19.626
<i>North Korea

02:19.738 --> 02:21.000
<i>and belligerent manner.</i>

02:21.106 --> 02:23.574
<i>There are consequences to such actions.</i>

02:23.775 --> 02:24.969
<i>Fueling the fire,</i>

<i>the North has ripped up
non-aggression pacts.</i>

02:27.246 --> 02:30.147
<i>This is an incredibly immature
regime in the North.</i>

02:30.249 --> 02:33.218
<i>The rogue North Korean
dictator makes a wild threat</i>

<i>to wipe out the United States.</i>

02:35.420 --> 02:37.251
<i>North Korea is like a spoiled child.</i>

02:37.356 --> 02:39.436
<i>North Korea is a danger to the world.</i>

<i>What is it that they want?</i>

02:44.196 --> 02:45.916
<i>What are they preparing for?</i>

02:57.109 --> 02:58.303
<i>So far, this quarter,</i>

02:58.410 --> 03:01.709
<i>Eckert has got to make up some ground
and try to get in field goal position.</i>

03:01.813 --> 03:04.008
<i>But with the clock running down
and no time-outs left,</i>

03:04.116 --> 03:05.674
<i>Wolverines are in a tough fix.</i>

03:10.455 --> 03:11.752
<i>Out of bounds!</i>

03:11.957 --> 03:14.983
- How did that one feel, bitch?
- Get off him!

03:15.194 --> 03:16.525
Hey, man, you got rocked.

03:16.728 --> 03:18.320
He hits hard!

03:19.731 --> 03:21.631
Matty, be careful.

03:21.733 --> 03:25.191
Eckert! Thirty seconds left.
Just get us in field goal range!

03:25.370 --> 03:27.065
Come on, kid, now, execute!

03:27.172 --> 03:30.198
Empty left! Empty left!

03:33.812 --> 03:35.279
How's he doing?

03:41.153 --> 03:42.211
Wolverines!

03:42.421 --> 03:43.752
Your ass is mine, bitch!

03:43.956 --> 03:48.120
You hitting on me, 53?
Mac 53, Mac 53. Hut!

03:54.499 --> 03:56.660
Eckert, you got to stop
with the cowboy shit!

03:56.802 --> 03:59.168
If I did that,
I'd still be back on the 20, Coach!

03:59.338 --> 04:02.535
Get Danny on the corner!
Tell him to get his ass out of bounds!

04:02.741 --> 04:04.641
- Line! Line!
- Pick him up. Pick him up.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.208
Lead your team, 9!

04:06.411 --> 04:08.212
- Take us to the house, Eckert!
- Hut!

04:11.383 --> 04:13.146
You got to stop the clock!

04:14.653 --> 04:15.642
Take it out of bounds!

04:17.856 --> 04:18.982
<i>Clock is still running.</i>

04:19.190 --> 04:20.351
Field goal, Archer!

04:20.459 --> 04:21.687
Coach, let me go for it!

04:21.793 --> 04:24.591
You got to be kidding me!
Field goal! Come on!

04:26.365 --> 04:27.805
Kitner, what the hell are you doing?

04:27.866 --> 04:29.390
It's for the podcast for
the school website.

04:29.501 --> 04:30.901
They allow cursing on that podcast?

04:31.003 --> 04:31.992
No, sir.

04:32.104 --> 04:33.465
Then get that shit out of my face!

04:40.979 --> 04:42.276
<i>No good!</i>

04:44.216 --> 04:45.706
<i>And that's the game.</i>

04:45.884 --> 04:49.513
<i>Final score, Titans, 17. Wolverines, 14.</i>

04:50.555 --> 04:53.820
<i>Thanks for coming out tonight, Wolverines.
We'll see you next time.</i>

04:55.894 --> 04:59.261
Hey, hey. It's my bad. My bad.

05:03.902 --> 05:07.929
Hey, bitch! We're going to the finals,
you want a ticket?

05:08.140 --> 05:11.598
Awesome! Glad I could help.

05:21.553 --> 05:23.521
God damn it.

05:42.674 --> 05:43.732
Ow!

05:43.842 --> 05:44.968
Why are you hitting me?

05:45.177 --> 05:48.442
Because it's more fun
than watching you stress.

05:48.647 --> 05:50.638
Get out of your head.

05:50.849 --> 05:52.714
Let's have a good time.

05:53.418 --> 05:54.749
Sounds like a plan.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.328
Ow.

06:04.863 --> 06:07.331
When is this supposed to get fun for me?

06:07.532 --> 06:08.999
- Soon.
- Soon?

06:09.201 --> 06:10.691
Pussy.

06:14.272 --> 06:15.672
Now you're in the Air Force, right?

06:15.707 --> 06:16.799
Marines, actually.

06:16.908 --> 06:19.189
Yeah? I got a cousin that joined.
Where are you stationed?

06:19.544 --> 06:21.205
I was in Najaf.

06:21.413 --> 06:23.040
Down in California?

06:23.548 --> 06:25.175
Close. Iraq.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.249
Can I have another beer, please?

06:34.359 --> 06:37.692
I mean, what are we
even fighting for, you know?

06:39.631 --> 06:41.189
Cheers.

06:46.471 --> 06:48.336
Jed Eckert.

06:49.374 --> 06:50.841
- Toni.
- Toni Walsh.

06:51.042 --> 06:52.031
Our families...

06:52.144 --> 06:54.669
Our families used to go camping
together, I remember.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.576
And you were always the oldest,
so you'd end up babysitting.

06:57.783 --> 07:00.775
I used to think of it more
as being a scout leader or something.

07:00.986 --> 07:02.283
Or babysitting.

07:02.487 --> 07:04.182
Or babysitting, maybe, yeah.

07:05.657 --> 07:09.491
Oh, God, and your mom used to make us
sing the most ridiculous songs.

07:12.697 --> 07:14.995
Shit. I'm sorry.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.633
Nothing to be sorry about.

07:16.835 --> 07:19.326
I know it was hard on you guys.

07:20.739 --> 07:21.706
Yeah.

07:21.907 --> 07:24.034
So, how long are you here for?

07:24.242 --> 07:26.039
- A few weeks.
- Then what?

07:26.211 --> 07:28.475
Then it's off to wherever
they want to send me next.

07:33.752 --> 07:35.185
Hey, Toni!

07:35.387 --> 07:38.413
- We're right here. Hi.
- Okay.

07:39.925 --> 07:42.894
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

07:47.265 --> 07:48.586
You guys won't miss these, right?

07:48.767 --> 07:50.462
- No, of course not.
- Not at all, Toni.

07:54.706 --> 07:56.571
Hey, sweetie.

07:58.009 --> 08:00.068
What's gotten into you?

08:00.512 --> 08:03.072
- Matt, nice game.
- Yeah, wasn't it amazing?

08:13.325 --> 08:15.316
- You out?
- Yeah, man, I'm out.

08:15.527 --> 08:17.017
<i>And we're getting reports now</i>

08:17.229 --> 08:20.858
<i>that the blackout may run
along the entire Northwest corridor.</i>

08:21.066 --> 08:24.502
<i>Still no information on what may have
caused this massive failure, but...</i>

08:27.372 --> 08:29.499
- So, Matty.
- Yo!

08:30.041 --> 08:32.839
You didn't tell me your brother was back
and all grown up.

08:33.144 --> 08:35.304
Why are you so interested?

08:35.514 --> 08:39.610
Because I'm an only child
and I'm curious about sibling rivalry.

08:44.422 --> 08:46.686
I wish you had told us you were coming.

08:46.892 --> 08:50.123
I still can't find the extra sheets
for the foldout. I've looked everywhere.

08:50.328 --> 08:53.229
Dad, don't worry about it.
The couch is fine.

09:03.074 --> 09:04.871
Love you.

09:05.076 --> 09:06.202
I love you!

09:06.411 --> 09:08.743
- Love you.
- Love you.

09:08.947 --> 09:09.914
See you.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.139
Hey, girls.

09:13.251 --> 09:14.616
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:14.819 --> 09:17.447
Got blackout duty.
Got to go rein in the crazies.

09:18.156 --> 09:19.521
So, you saw the game?

09:19.991 --> 09:22.459
Yes, sir, I saw it all.

09:24.296 --> 09:25.263
I'm proud of you.

09:25.664 --> 09:28.258
You played your hardest.
That's what matters.

09:28.466 --> 09:30.798
They're lucky to have you.

09:31.269 --> 09:32.327
Later.

09:55.527 --> 09:57.154
You want a beer?

10:02.133 --> 10:03.760
Hey, Matty, what are you doing?

10:05.437 --> 10:06.563
I'm getting a drink.

10:06.771 --> 10:09.205
Okay, you got a drink.
Close the door, the power's out.

10:09.541 --> 10:11.168
Lighten up, man.

10:11.376 --> 10:13.617
Hey, don't you have to
secure the perimeter or something?

10:14.212 --> 10:17.010
A rendezvous with douche company?

11:01.092 --> 11:02.787
What's going on?

11:33.258 --> 11:36.227
Matty! We've got to find Dad. Come on.

11:49.274 --> 11:50.366
I got no reception!

11:50.508 --> 11:51.497
Try the radio.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.009
Son of a bitch.

11:56.948 --> 11:58.074
What is this?

11:58.450 --> 11:59.712
I don't know.

12:02.454 --> 12:03.614
Shit.

12:04.489 --> 12:05.513
Hang on!

12:19.637 --> 12:21.104
Stay on my ass!

12:41.760 --> 12:43.091
Hang on!

12:46.231 --> 12:47.425
Shit!

12:53.571 --> 12:55.163
- Get to the cabin!
- What? No!

12:56.374 --> 12:57.466
The cabin!

12:57.575 --> 12:59.295
Jed, take care of your brother,
you hear me?

12:59.410 --> 13:02.038
Get out of here while you still can.
Go now! Go!

13:02.247 --> 13:04.442
- No!
- Come on!

13:10.522 --> 13:11.682
Jed, go!

13:16.728 --> 13:19.094
- Jed, we got to get Erica.
- Where?

13:19.197 --> 13:20.357
Next right!

13:24.969 --> 13:26.436
Hold on!

13:34.979 --> 13:36.071
Pool!

13:51.129 --> 13:52.118
Erica.

13:53.631 --> 13:55.462
- Matt!
- Erica!

13:55.667 --> 13:56.656
No, Matty!

13:59.871 --> 14:01.133
Get off me!

14:01.339 --> 14:02.601
Erica!

14:03.341 --> 14:04.433
Matty!

14:09.047 --> 14:10.514
Matt! Jed!

14:11.049 --> 14:13.142
Come on! Come on!

14:13.351 --> 14:14.409
Jump in!

14:16.321 --> 14:17.948
Go, go, go!

14:21.492 --> 14:23.517
No, no, no!

14:25.196 --> 14:26.424
No, that's my son!

14:26.531 --> 14:28.999
They're just boys, okay? They're just boys.

14:46.351 --> 14:48.581
- What do we do?
- Just follow us!

14:48.753 --> 14:49.879
Come on!

15:04.102 --> 15:05.194
Oh, shit!

15:17.382 --> 15:19.077
- Jed!
- I know, I see it.

15:25.790 --> 15:26.916
Jed!

15:41.072 --> 15:42.130
Shit.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.637
Come on!

15:48.313 --> 15:50.281
- Go!
- Yes.

16:39.931 --> 16:41.193
Anyone hurt?

16:41.399 --> 16:42.696
I don't know.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.001
I don't think so.

16:46.904 --> 16:48.565
We had to leave, okay?

16:56.881 --> 16:58.007
I'm Pete.

17:02.553 --> 17:04.384
They're from out of town.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.420
San Diego or something.

17:06.991 --> 17:08.458
They just saw their dad get killed.

17:11.996 --> 17:13.554
Okay, listen.

17:13.765 --> 17:16.928
I want you to take these guys
and see what you can find in there.

17:17.135 --> 17:18.295
I'll get the generator going.

17:18.502 --> 17:20.104
Jed, we got to find out what's going on.

17:20.171 --> 17:21.160
My parents, what about my mom?

17:21.305 --> 17:24.502
Robert, you're right. That's your job.
So, find a radio or TV

17:24.608 --> 17:26.473
and get us reception. Get it working, okay?

17:26.611 --> 17:28.731
- But Jed, we can't just stay here.
- Say yes, Robert.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.372
Yeah.

17:31.149 --> 17:32.377
Okay.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.334
Hook it in there.

18:18.863 --> 18:21.058
<i>Coming to you live from Seattle.</i>

18:21.799 --> 18:23.027
There.

18:23.234 --> 18:25.429
- Is that it?
- No, no. Go back.

18:25.837 --> 18:26.895
Freeze, freeze.

18:27.004 --> 18:29.131
<i>...no longer controlled
by the government of the United States.</i>

18:29.273 --> 18:32.037
<i>Don't go outside
unless it's an absolute emergency.</i>

18:32.243 --> 18:36.202
<i>Accidents are more likely to happen when
people move about unnecessarily.</i>

18:36.481 --> 18:37.505
Accidents?

18:37.615 --> 18:40.209
<i>If you've become separated from someone
and you don't know where they are,</i>

18:40.318 --> 18:42.582
<i>a hotline has been set up to help you.</i>

18:42.787 --> 18:43.913
Hey, what the hell, man?

18:44.021 --> 18:45.488
Bullshit.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.350
What does that mean?

18:49.026 --> 18:50.926
It means we're screwed.

19:09.413 --> 19:10.505
Hey!

19:11.682 --> 19:13.149
Hey! Do you hear that?

19:14.919 --> 19:16.682
Matty, kill the lights. Let's go!

19:18.990 --> 19:20.184
What are you doing?

19:20.324 --> 19:22.554
I'm going to draw them away
and hope like hell they take the bait.

19:22.660 --> 19:23.786
I'll come with you.

19:23.895 --> 19:26.363
No, you're gonna be cutting the lights
and keeping those assholes quiet.

19:26.464 --> 19:28.989
- What if I cut the...
- Just do what I say.

19:44.782 --> 19:46.340
Come on, Matty.

20:03.901 --> 20:04.993
No!

20:05.102 --> 20:07.127
Stop! Hold your fire.

20:10.308 --> 20:12.028
- What did I tell you to do?
- It wasn't me.

20:12.109 --> 20:13.406
You almost took my head off!

20:13.511 --> 20:14.739
I thought they got past you.

20:17.648 --> 20:18.808
You give me the gun.

20:19.183 --> 20:21.014
I'm not giving you dick.

20:21.819 --> 20:23.616
Who the hell put you in charge, anyway?

20:25.990 --> 20:27.719
Okay, let's compromise.

20:31.996 --> 20:33.122
What?

20:33.497 --> 20:34.794
More?

20:40.438 --> 20:41.735
Shit.

20:42.506 --> 20:43.837
Give me that.

20:45.576 --> 20:46.702
Danny.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.473
Man!

20:49.513 --> 20:50.844
Your dad said you were up here.

20:51.349 --> 20:53.010
You saw him? Was he okay?

20:53.751 --> 20:55.844
Yeah, but it's bad down there, man.

20:58.789 --> 21:00.222
Where are our troops, Jed?

21:00.424 --> 21:01.448
I don't know.

21:03.494 --> 21:04.620
Toni.

21:05.496 --> 21:06.588
You hurt?

21:06.797 --> 21:08.287
No, I'm fine.

21:08.933 --> 21:10.025
Fine.

21:11.402 --> 21:13.199
Is Erica here?

21:14.105 --> 21:16.073
I think they took her.

21:22.413 --> 21:24.074
Everybody inside.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.354
Wake up.

21:41.932 --> 21:42.990
What's wrong?

21:43.100 --> 21:46.092
That asshole Pete and his buddy
took off with all the food.

21:47.204 --> 21:49.035
I need you guys
to take anything we can use,

21:49.240 --> 21:51.041
put it in the truck and
hide it in the woods.

21:51.642 --> 21:53.883
And that prick knows
where we are so keep your eyes open.

21:54.412 --> 21:56.539
Matty, come with me. Let's go. Get up.

22:03.454 --> 22:04.716
North Korea.

22:04.955 --> 22:06.752
It doesn't make any sense.

22:06.857 --> 22:09.655
There's a bigger picture here.
They had to have had help.

22:10.127 --> 22:11.651
You think it's like this everywhere?

22:12.396 --> 22:15.524
I don't think they've come all this way
just for Spokane and Seattle.

22:22.239 --> 22:24.002
Where do you think Dad is?

22:24.208 --> 22:25.766
Probably down there.

22:27.078 --> 22:30.809
With anyone else they think is a threat
or they can get information from.

22:33.984 --> 22:35.781
You think Erica is in there?

22:37.488 --> 22:39.115
Your girl is a fighter.

22:40.024 --> 22:41.218
She'll be okay.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.880
<i>We got to get them out of there.</i>

22:43.928 --> 22:45.896
We can't just call 911, Matty.

22:46.997 --> 22:50.364
We got to stay put for now and just pray
like hell it doesn't get any worse.

22:51.836 --> 22:53.235
Hey!

22:57.608 --> 23:00.008
Hey! They found us.

23:10.254 --> 23:11.516
There's no one here.

23:11.689 --> 23:13.919
I swear. This is where they were.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.523
Son of a bitch. It's Pete.

23:24.502 --> 23:26.060
Holy shit. Daryl, that's your dad.

23:26.270 --> 23:27.897
What? Let me see.

23:28.005 --> 23:29.632
Quiet. Stay down.

23:33.444 --> 23:34.741
Jesus Christ.

23:47.558 --> 23:48.855
<i>Boys,</i>

23:49.427 --> 23:51.088
<i>it's Mayor Jenkins.</i>

23:53.330 --> 23:58.563
<i>Captain Cho here is the acting prefect
of this district.</i>

23:58.836 --> 24:02.897
<i>He says you seriously injured
some of his men</i>

24:03.107 --> 24:05.166
<i>and he's given me his word,</i>

24:05.376 --> 24:09.904
<i>if you turn yourselves in,
no one is going to be hurt. Okay?</i>

24:15.052 --> 24:16.178
<i>Boys?</i>

24:26.330 --> 24:27.797
<i>Daryl?</i>

24:30.367 --> 24:31.698
<i>Son?</i>

24:32.069 --> 24:34.037
<i>I'd like you to come home.</i>

24:41.912 --> 24:43.641
Guys, shouldn't we do what he says?

24:44.915 --> 24:46.041
What do we do, Jed?

24:46.217 --> 24:47.479
We don't move.

24:47.585 --> 24:50.076
- But if my dad trusts this guy...
- Daryl, shut up.

24:50.588 --> 24:52.055
Everybody stay still.

25:05.336 --> 25:06.564
<i>Boys.</i>

25:07.471 --> 25:09.302
<i>If youâ€™re out there,</i>

25:09.507 --> 25:11.304
<i>if you can hear me, listen up.</i>

25:12.776 --> 25:15.267
<i>It's a tough situation all the way around.</i>

25:16.614 --> 25:18.912
<i>A lot of tough choices.</i>

25:22.152 --> 25:23.585
<i>I love you both.</i>

25:27.858 --> 25:29.223
<i>I hope you know that.</i>

25:38.802 --> 25:41.362
<i>What I'm going to ask you to do</i>

25:41.572 --> 25:43.472
<i>may be very difficult,</i>

25:45.709 --> 25:48.177
<i>but I want you boys</i>

25:48.379 --> 25:50.609
<i>to do what I would do.</i>

25:53.717 --> 25:58.177
<i>I want you to go to war
and stop this piece of shit.</i>

25:58.389 --> 25:59.788
<i>Or die trying.</i>

26:15.873 --> 26:17.033
Tom!

26:17.141 --> 26:20.167
- No! No!
- Matty! Stay here!

27:38.956 --> 27:40.583
They're going to find us.

27:40.791 --> 27:42.588
Guys, what are we even doing up here?

27:43.293 --> 27:44.624
We should just go back.

27:45.295 --> 27:46.853
Matt, I'm sorry.

27:47.064 --> 27:48.861
My parents are still down there.

27:49.266 --> 27:51.461
I'm worried something's
going to happen to my dad.

27:51.802 --> 27:52.962
Maybe he could help us.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.035
He can't help us, Daryl.

27:55.239 --> 27:56.365
He's helping them.

27:56.573 --> 27:57.733
What's that supposed to mean?

27:57.808 --> 27:59.708
It means he's helping them.

27:59.843 --> 28:01.834
You saw him, he just stood there
and watched.

28:02.179 --> 28:03.459
What else was he supposed to do?

28:03.514 --> 28:05.209
Our dad made a choice.

28:06.283 --> 28:08.945
And Daryl's dad's got to make one, too.
We all do.

28:16.727 --> 28:17.989
We're going home.

28:18.195 --> 28:19.389
Robert,

28:19.496 --> 28:21.293
your parents aren't down there.

28:28.572 --> 28:31.268
I saw it. I didn't know how to tell you.

28:42.753 --> 28:44.516
We can't go home.

28:45.255 --> 28:47.951
We can't keep running.
What are we supposed to do?

28:51.695 --> 28:53.663
I'm going to fight.

28:55.933 --> 28:57.560
I'm going to fight.

28:58.869 --> 29:02.896
Now this is easier for me
because I'm used to it.

29:03.107 --> 29:06.270
But the rest of you
are going to have a tougher choice.

29:06.877 --> 29:09.744
Look, I don't want to sell it to you,
it's too ugly for that.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.848
It's ugly, and it's hard.

29:13.117 --> 29:15.483
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

29:15.686 --> 29:18.246
and you're fighting for your family,

29:18.522 --> 29:21.650
it all hurts a little less
and it makes a little more sense.

29:22.693 --> 29:25.662
And for them, this is just some place.

29:26.463 --> 29:27.760
But for us,

29:28.766 --> 29:30.393
this is our home.

29:35.038 --> 29:38.633
<i>Obviously, we don't stand a chance
against these guys in a straight-up fight.</i>

29:39.810 --> 29:42.108
<i>But if you look at the Viet Cong
or the Mujahideen,</i>

29:42.312 --> 29:44.644
<i>or even the Minutemen, it's clear.</i>

29:45.382 --> 29:48.374
<i>Even the tiniest flea
can drive a big dog crazy.</i>

29:52.523 --> 29:55.890
<i>So, the first thing we have to do
is learn how to work together.</i>

29:57.227 --> 29:58.353
<i>Become a unit.</i>

29:59.496 --> 30:01.794
<i>And that's going to take some time.</i>

30:02.566 --> 30:03.794
That's gross.

30:06.403 --> 30:08.667
<i>It doesn't take much to pull a trigger.</i>

30:09.072 --> 30:13.304
<i>But keeping your shit together
in a firefight is a whole different story.</i>

30:14.344 --> 30:16.039
<i>So we're going to have to evolve.</i>

30:17.414 --> 30:19.609
<i>Rewire our reflexes.</i>

30:20.450 --> 30:23.351
<i>Learn new skills and adapt old ones.</i>

30:25.589 --> 30:29.184
<i>There's almost half a million faces
down there and they can't track them all.</i>

30:30.394 --> 30:32.055
<i>So, we'll find people we can trust.</i>

30:32.930 --> 30:34.795
<i>Friends with their ears to the ground</i>

30:34.998 --> 30:38.434
<i>who can help us get the things
we need to fight back.</i>

30:41.405 --> 30:42.929
<i>We'll watch what they do.</i>

30:43.140 --> 30:45.904
<i>Study their tactics, their routines.</i>

30:46.310 --> 30:49.575
<i>The more we know,
the easier it will be to hurt them.</i>

30:50.981 --> 30:52.573
<i>But we'll need to be smart.</i>

30:52.783 --> 30:54.444
<i>And we'll need to be patient.</i>

30:55.819 --> 30:57.309
<i>We'll hit them on our terms.</i>

30:58.121 --> 30:59.748
<i>When we're good and ready.</i>

31:06.797 --> 31:08.321
<i>We inherited our freedom.</i>

31:11.301 --> 31:13.269
<i>Now it's up to all of us to fight for it.</i>

31:19.042 --> 31:20.236
These things are bad ass.

31:20.444 --> 31:22.207
Not if you know anything.

31:46.803 --> 31:48.600
We need to get better weapons.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.968
<i>Your livelihood is our utmost concern.</i>

31:53.176 --> 31:54.871
<i>We are creating a better world</i>

31:54.978 --> 31:58.141
<i>where you and your family
can be taken care of.</i>

32:36.153 --> 32:37.552
Forty seconds.

32:38.588 --> 32:40.681
The weapons and ammo, get it all.

32:55.706 --> 32:56.764
Robert, you okay?

32:57.074 --> 32:58.336
Yeah.

32:59.242 --> 33:00.402
Let's go.

33:29.106 --> 33:30.767
Come on, come on!

33:35.712 --> 33:37.771
We've got what we need. Let's go!

33:39.549 --> 33:40.777
Holy shit!

33:41.051 --> 33:43.918
Hey, Jed. Isn't this C4?

34:19.922 --> 34:21.254
I can't. This is stupid.

34:21.358 --> 34:24.623
Yes, you can. Come on, just sight it up.

34:27.397 --> 34:29.331
Now, one shot, behind the shoulder.

34:30.367 --> 34:31.800
Just relax.

34:32.369 --> 34:34.530
Breathe out and squeeze.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.601
Shit.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.572
You got him.

34:59.729 --> 35:01.162
What is this?

35:02.032 --> 35:05.798
You drink the blood latte,
or the deer's spirit, or some shit?

35:06.303 --> 35:08.362
It's not "some shit," Robert.

35:09.239 --> 35:10.536
It's tradition, Robert.

35:10.674 --> 35:12.005
Drink up.

35:26.857 --> 35:28.347
Dude, it's not that bad actually.

35:28.592 --> 35:29.718
No?

35:30.460 --> 35:32.155
What did it taste like?

35:32.562 --> 35:33.620
Well, you know.

35:33.730 --> 35:36.324
- Hell, no, we don't.
- We never drank that shit.

35:39.202 --> 35:40.567
That can't be safe!

36:29.853 --> 36:31.150
Okay, you guys ready?

36:32.122 --> 36:33.589
How you feeling?

36:33.857 --> 36:35.449
I don't know.

36:35.559 --> 36:37.891
It's all right, man. I feel the same way.

36:38.028 --> 36:40.724
Look, I know we're outnumbered
and we're out-gunned.

36:40.931 --> 36:43.058
But that doesn't mean
we can't make a difference.

36:43.266 --> 36:45.461
So it's up to us to let people know

36:45.669 --> 36:47.864
that there is a fight on.

36:48.071 --> 36:50.471
A fight that we need them to join.

36:50.674 --> 36:53.541
Most of those soldiers down there,
they don't want to be here.

36:53.743 --> 36:56.007
So we have to make it too hard,

36:56.179 --> 37:00.240
and too difficult and too bloody
for them to stay.

37:00.850 --> 37:04.479
When I was overseas,
we were the good guys. We enforced order.

37:04.688 --> 37:07.452
Now we're the bad guys

37:07.657 --> 37:09.284
and we create chaos.

37:11.027 --> 37:12.460
<i>We are creating a better world</i>

37:12.562 --> 37:15.861
<i>where you and your family
can be taken care of.</i>

37:16.066 --> 37:17.795
<i>We are here to serve the people.</i>

37:30.080 --> 37:31.911
Come on! Come on!

37:32.082 --> 37:33.276
Move! Let's go!

37:33.416 --> 37:34.713
Come on, let's go.

37:49.599 --> 37:50.998
That's Captain Cho.

38:16.993 --> 38:18.221
Let's go.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.702
Okay, 15 seconds.

38:39.215 --> 38:40.341
Who are they?

38:40.483 --> 38:41.882
Collaborators.

38:42.218 --> 38:43.480
Had to happen.

38:50.727 --> 38:52.388
Okay, here we go. Look alive.

39:01.971 --> 39:03.370
Hey!

39:03.573 --> 39:05.063
Hey, Pete!

39:05.275 --> 39:06.708
The Wolverines!

39:08.178 --> 39:09.611
It's the Wolverines...

39:45.915 --> 39:47.439
Dude.

39:50.854 --> 39:52.014
Dude!

39:54.791 --> 39:56.258
Nobody move!

39:59.028 --> 40:01.087
Sandwich artist! Fill this shit with bread!

40:01.231 --> 40:03.256
- What kind?
- I don't care! Just no flat bread.

40:03.533 --> 40:05.558
- Wheat! Honey oat!
- Tuna! Turkey!

40:06.803 --> 40:07.929
Shit!

40:12.008 --> 40:13.100
Did they see us?

40:13.209 --> 40:14.904
I don't know. Just get the food.

40:15.278 --> 40:16.768
Go! Get the food!

40:23.953 --> 40:25.784
<i>Good afternoon, patriots.</i>

40:26.289 --> 40:27.984
<i>This is Radio Free America.</i>

40:28.191 --> 40:29.488
<i>Broadcasting live</i>

40:29.692 --> 40:31.125
<i>to the occupied zone.</i>

40:31.327 --> 40:32.919
Oh, my God, that was good.

40:33.129 --> 40:34.653
I missed this.

40:35.799 --> 40:37.061
You know what else I miss?

40:37.801 --> 40:38.825
Pizza.

40:39.035 --> 40:40.400
Toilets that flush.

40:40.503 --> 40:42.130
<i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</i>

40:42.238 --> 40:43.603
Dude, we're living <i>Call of Duty.</i>

40:43.773 --> 40:44.899
And it sucks.

40:45.675 --> 40:47.404
You guys are amateurs, man.

40:47.877 --> 40:49.242
I miss girls.

40:49.879 --> 40:51.506
No, not like you.

40:51.648 --> 40:54.276
I mean like hot, sexy,

40:55.318 --> 40:56.808
voluptuous girls.

40:56.953 --> 40:57.977
Nice.

40:58.087 --> 41:00.021
Girls without AKs.

41:00.123 --> 41:02.091
Who needs AKs?

41:05.328 --> 41:06.522
Matt.

41:06.729 --> 41:08.458
Come on, bro, what do you miss?

41:28.151 --> 41:30.779
<i>Your livelihood is our utmost concern.</i>

41:30.987 --> 41:35.117
<i>We are creating a better world
where you and your family...</i>

41:35.425 --> 41:38.553
<i>You have been
tainted by American culture.</i>

41:38.761 --> 41:42.094
<i>With the right leadership,
we can make this country...</i>

41:42.298 --> 41:45.893
<i>You have been living in a disguised land
of righteousness.</i>

41:46.336 --> 41:50.136
<i>You live in a world that segregates you
into classes.</i>

41:50.507 --> 41:52.407
<i>We are here to help.</i>

41:52.609 --> 41:54.804
<i>For two-and-a-quarter centuries,</i>

41:55.011 --> 41:58.447
<i>you have been living in a realm of slavery.</i>

42:18.401 --> 42:20.335
<i>Whatever I say is just
going to piss you off.</i>

42:20.537 --> 42:21.970
So why don't we just forget it?

42:22.171 --> 42:23.638
Forget what?

42:24.974 --> 42:26.839
That you've been putting
everyone here at risk?

42:28.444 --> 42:29.741
Erica's still out there, Jed.

42:29.946 --> 42:31.174
And what happens when you get caught?

42:31.381 --> 42:33.212
Because if it were me,
you wouldn't keep looking, right?

42:33.416 --> 42:36.010
Not if it meant putting everyone else's ass
on the line.

42:36.219 --> 42:38.380
- I'm not you, Jed.
- No, you're not.

42:38.588 --> 42:39.850
The team has got to come first.

42:40.056 --> 42:41.387
Get that through your head.

42:41.591 --> 42:43.889
Erica's my family, Jed.

42:44.093 --> 42:45.333
She's more family than you are.

42:45.395 --> 42:46.657
Yeah?

42:48.231 --> 42:49.823
You're going to get us all killed.

42:57.974 --> 42:59.703
That's how you get Cho.

43:20.430 --> 43:22.557
The rally is at
2:00 at the main square.

43:22.765 --> 43:24.164
So, decoy, like before.

43:24.367 --> 43:26.232
A little car bomb goes off here.

43:27.203 --> 43:29.637
The crowd clears, security rushes in,

43:29.839 --> 43:33.172
and that is when Mr. Big-Ass Mother-F
bomb under the stage

43:33.376 --> 43:35.742
is going to blow that bastard
to kingdom come.

43:40.950 --> 43:43.214
<i>We are not your enemies.</i>

43:43.419 --> 43:45.785
<i>Because you, too, are victims.</i>

43:45.989 --> 43:50.221
<i>Victims of an American culture
in which greed, irresponsibility</i>

43:50.426 --> 43:53.156
<i>and fraud were openly encouraged.</i>

43:53.363 --> 43:54.853
<i>Victims of a corrupt government</i>

43:55.064 --> 43:57.555
<i>in bed with the tyrants of Wall Street.</i>

43:58.501 --> 44:01.902
<i>It is our sincerest belief
that with the right leadership</i>

44:02.105 --> 44:03.663
<i>and with your support,</i>

44:04.140 --> 44:07.844
<i>this country will rise again, better,</i>

44:08.378 --> 44:11.108
<i>morally superior to what was here before.</i>

44:11.948 --> 44:13.916
<i>But we need your help.</i>

44:14.283 --> 44:19.186
<i>We have teams of engineers
ready to restore power and utilities.</i>

44:19.389 --> 44:21.380
<i>But we cannot provide these things</i>

44:21.591 --> 44:23.718
<i>until the situation stabilizes.</i>

44:23.926 --> 44:27.623
<i>We must all arouse
the political consciousness of the people.</i>

44:27.997 --> 44:29.430
Son of a bitch!

44:29.565 --> 44:30.554
What?

44:30.667 --> 44:32.601
The guy sitting behind Cho, he's Russian.

44:32.802 --> 44:33.928
Are you serious?

44:34.070 --> 44:35.470
The blue beret means he's Spetsnaz.

44:35.605 --> 44:36.936
Russian Special Forces.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.234
What's his specialty?

44:38.441 --> 44:40.500
Counter-insurgency, for starters.

44:40.677 --> 44:42.110
Are they here because of us?

44:42.211 --> 44:44.236
Well, if they are, they're a little late.

44:49.318 --> 44:51.559
You got to get out of here.
Some shit is about to happen.

44:52.221 --> 44:55.088
<i>So the collective states can rise again</i>

44:55.291 --> 44:57.191
<i>and stand united again.</i>

44:58.661 --> 45:02.654
<i>We are here to facilitate
this important objective...</i>

45:02.865 --> 45:05.231
Ninety seconds.

45:05.435 --> 45:09.371
<i>... while a new social and economic
initiative is implemented.</i>

45:10.073 --> 45:12.701
<i>Now, regular curfews
will commence tonight.</i>

45:13.242 --> 45:16.678
<i>They're designed
to preserve the social order.</i>

45:16.879 --> 45:18.141
Daryl.

45:21.217 --> 45:22.479
You okay?

45:25.922 --> 45:27.219
Yeah.

45:31.761 --> 45:34.389
<i>But full compliance is mandatory.</i>

45:34.597 --> 45:36.189
<i>No exceptions.</i>

45:36.399 --> 45:40.768
<i>The regulatory board
has suspended all visiting hours</i>

45:40.970 --> 45:43.598
<i>at the United Workers 'Reform.</i>

45:44.140 --> 45:48.702
<i>And so, it is with your well-being in mind</i>

45:49.445 --> 45:51.436
<i>that we ask for your cooperation</i>

45:51.647 --> 45:55.310
<i>in bringing these cowardly
Wolverine terrorists to justice.</i>

45:56.953 --> 45:58.011
Blow it.

45:58.121 --> 45:59.482
- It's not time yet.
- Blow it now!

46:02.959 --> 46:04.620
Hold your fire. Do not engage.

46:22.812 --> 46:23.779
Shit.

46:24.947 --> 46:26.380
Ambush!

46:29.552 --> 46:31.213
Daryl, come on!

46:42.498 --> 46:43.863
Matt!

46:44.200 --> 46:45.758
Erica!

46:49.305 --> 46:50.602
Let's go! Let's go!

46:50.807 --> 46:51.774
I can't!

46:51.974 --> 46:53.703
Oh, no.

46:54.277 --> 46:57.405
Where's the key? Where's the key, baby?
Where's the key?

47:01.050 --> 47:02.517
- Matt!
- We gotta fall back!

47:02.718 --> 47:03.685
Greg, come on!

47:03.886 --> 47:05.376
- Hey, let's go!
- Greg!

47:09.692 --> 47:11.990
- No! No!
- He's gone. We got to go now!

47:12.195 --> 47:13.457
Let's go!

47:20.870 --> 47:21.962
Shit! Stay down!

47:22.171 --> 47:23.229
Stay down!

47:26.676 --> 47:28.473
- Go, go, go!
- Go!

48:07.283 --> 48:09.410
Go, go, go!

48:49.792 --> 48:50.759
Here!

48:50.960 --> 48:53.292
Are you all right? Are you all right?

48:55.131 --> 48:58.157
Shit! We got to go, baby! We got to go!
We got to go!

49:08.678 --> 49:10.043
Oh, shit. Get going!

49:25.461 --> 49:26.723
Come on!

49:40.042 --> 49:42.408
Get in here! Get in here!

49:57.626 --> 49:59.253
Take what you need.

50:15.077 --> 50:17.204
- Thank you.
- Be safe.

50:28.157 --> 50:30.216
Don't worry.

50:30.659 --> 50:32.650
Stay calm, we're almost home.

50:38.567 --> 50:40.660
Danny, bring me the scissors.

50:44.907 --> 50:46.238
I need more light.

50:53.149 --> 50:55.447
Toni, I'm going to need some ice.

50:55.651 --> 50:57.312
Can you bring some from outside?

51:11.367 --> 51:13.528
Oh, my God. Erica!

51:15.438 --> 51:17.736
- Hey.
- I wouldn't go in there right now.

51:17.940 --> 51:19.669
- Why?
- Julie's freaking out.

51:19.875 --> 51:21.240
What does that mean?

51:25.714 --> 51:27.739
When you decided to run off

51:27.950 --> 51:29.383
and do your own thing,

51:30.619 --> 51:32.951
Greg was killed trying to help you.

51:51.173 --> 51:52.902
It was a few days ago.

51:53.109 --> 51:56.101
These Russian soldiers
came to the stadium.

51:56.479 --> 51:59.243
They kept asking me who you guys knew

51:59.715 --> 52:03.014
and who might be helping you.

52:03.219 --> 52:04.811
And they even had a list of names.

52:05.688 --> 52:08.282
Jed, all our contacts in town, man.
We can't...

52:08.491 --> 52:11.426
Look, we are not a rescue unit.
We can't save everyone.

52:12.161 --> 52:14.652
Wait. So we're not going to do anything?

52:20.002 --> 52:23.062
I didn't say that, did I?

52:34.817 --> 52:35.909
You are guilty

52:36.552 --> 52:38.713
of giving aid to the terrorist Wolverines.

52:55.371 --> 52:56.497
Shit.

53:28.470 --> 53:32.270
Wolverines! Wolverines!

53:32.675 --> 53:35.007
Wolverines!

53:35.377 --> 53:36.810
Wolverines!

54:05.307 --> 54:07.935
Matt's been gone for days.

54:09.078 --> 54:11.376
I'm worried about him.

54:11.947 --> 54:14.040
Yeah, I know.

55:11.407 --> 55:13.932
What are you doing here, Matty?

55:18.314 --> 55:21.078
Topping everything off.
Making sure the ammo's dry.

55:21.183 --> 55:23.981
That's great. That's where we need you.
Off on your own, doing your own thing.

55:24.086 --> 55:26.247
- We really gonna do this now, Jed?
- Yeah, we are.

55:26.455 --> 55:27.854
I couldn't just leave her there.

55:28.057 --> 55:30.582
- You left your post.
- What the hell else was I supposed to do?

55:30.793 --> 55:32.226
I need to know I can count on you.

55:32.428 --> 55:33.861
Well, maybe you can't.

55:35.497 --> 55:37.624
What did you expect?

55:37.833 --> 55:40.768
You think you're the first to feel this?

55:41.003 --> 55:43.733
To see one of your friends get killed?

55:43.939 --> 55:45.497
This is war.

55:45.708 --> 55:47.471
So rub some dirt on it
and get your ass back in the fight.

55:47.676 --> 55:48.904
Spare me, Jed.

55:51.613 --> 55:53.308
I left for three days.

55:55.050 --> 55:59.146
When Mom died, you left for six years.
Right?

56:04.660 --> 56:05.991
Yeah.

56:09.365 --> 56:12.960
Yeah, Matty, you're right.

56:13.602 --> 56:18.198
I messed up. I left you
right when you needed me the most.

56:21.210 --> 56:23.508
And I'm sorry.

56:26.849 --> 56:29.977
I need you to be stronger than I was.

56:30.185 --> 56:32.380
- Mom and Dad are both gone.
- Shut up, Jed.

56:32.588 --> 56:34.146
It's just us.

56:34.356 --> 56:37.723
And more than anyone else in the group,
if I don't have you...

56:50.105 --> 56:52.733
Okay. Do what you want.

57:04.353 --> 57:06.548
<i>To the resistance fighters in Humboldt.</i>

57:06.755 --> 57:09.155
<i>The chair is against the wall.</i>

57:09.358 --> 57:12.054
<i>The chair is against the wall.</i>

57:38.987 --> 57:40.511
<i>And for the Wolverines of Spokane...</i>

57:40.722 --> 57:43.384
Guys, they're talking about us.

57:43.592 --> 57:47.187
<i>Keep up the pressure, patriots.</i>

57:47.396 --> 57:50.365
Wolverines, baby.

57:50.566 --> 57:52.591
Wolverines.

58:03.645 --> 58:06.113
It's beautiful, huh?

58:06.315 --> 58:07.543
Very.

58:10.185 --> 58:13.848
I wish I could look at it
without thinking of Laurie Stewart.

58:14.056 --> 58:15.353
What?

58:15.557 --> 58:17.388
Laurie Stewart.

58:17.593 --> 58:18.958
Who?

58:19.161 --> 58:22.096
Camping? Memorial Day weekend?

58:22.297 --> 58:23.457
I have no idea what you're talking about...

58:23.665 --> 58:26.862
We had that huge barbecue
and I ended up getting food poisoning,

58:26.969 --> 58:29.301
so I was in and out of my tent
all night puking,

58:29.404 --> 58:32.396
and that's when I saw the two of you
ducking into the lake together.

58:33.242 --> 58:36.302
- Oh, that Laurie Stewart.
- Oh, yeah, that one.

58:39.114 --> 58:40.274
Oh, man.

58:40.983 --> 58:43.247
You know, she was a good kisser.

58:43.752 --> 58:46.152
- She smelled like Aqua Net.
- What?

58:46.355 --> 58:47.447
Hairspray.

58:47.956 --> 58:49.856
Shit, that's right.

58:50.058 --> 58:51.650
She had that terrible haircut.

58:52.127 --> 58:54.425
The one that I immediately copied
and wore all through middle school,

58:54.530 --> 58:55.622
which you never noticed, by the way.

58:55.831 --> 58:58.095
No, I noticed. It was awful.

59:09.745 --> 59:12.771
Oh, shit. Go, go!

59:17.019 --> 59:18.850
Go! Go! Go!

59:20.422 --> 59:22.422
- We're safer inside!
- No way I'm staying in here!

59:37.806 --> 59:39.603
Julie? Julie?

59:40.709 --> 59:41.835
Julie!

59:42.044 --> 59:44.842
- Danny? Danny?
- Robert, she's gone.

59:45.047 --> 59:47.106
- We gotta go. He's gone.
- Danny!

59:47.215 --> 59:48.910
Daryl? Daryl? Can you hear me?

59:49.418 --> 59:52.080
Come on, we gotta go. We gotta go.
Grab your weapon.

59:53.422 --> 59:55.447
Let's move, come on.

01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:14.899
Run.

01:00:15.844 --> 01:00:17.778
Let's go, Matty. Matty, come on!

01:00:40.502 --> 01:00:41.526
I gotta stop.

01:00:41.737 --> 01:00:43.034
Come on.

01:00:43.572 --> 01:00:45.130
You can do it. I'll help you.

01:00:45.607 --> 01:00:47.700
I got it.

01:00:48.343 --> 01:00:49.401
Let's go.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.342
Let's go.

01:01:06.328 --> 01:01:08.091
Here.

01:01:27.516 --> 01:01:28.608
Jed?

01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:35.990
You should try to get some sleep.

01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:37.988
I'm okay.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.860
You know, this was...

01:01:44.066 --> 01:01:46.830
This was bound to happen, sooner or later.

01:01:47.035 --> 01:01:48.627
Yeah.

01:01:53.675 --> 01:01:56.337
I was talking to the group, Jed.

01:02:03.518 --> 01:02:05.119
They're starting to question everything.

01:02:05.253 --> 01:02:08.586
Nobody's saying they want to quit, but...

01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:10.881
Yeah?

01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:15.663
What do you think, Matty?

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.640
Rub some dirt on it.

01:03:38.446 --> 01:03:39.913
Who are you?

01:03:40.115 --> 01:03:42.845
You might want to answer that first.

01:03:43.318 --> 01:03:46.754
Let's put down those weapons.
Then we can lose the masks.

01:03:51.226 --> 01:03:53.023
What kind of shit-show did we drop into?

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:57.564
Sergeant Major Andrew Tanner.
Marine Corps.

01:03:58.166 --> 01:03:59.258
We're Alpha Company.

01:03:59.467 --> 01:04:00.729
Recently un-retired.

01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:02.198
Out of where?

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:03.801
Camp Pendleton.

01:04:04.005 --> 01:04:06.064
When there was a Camp Pendleton.

01:04:06.274 --> 01:04:07.969
Now we're part of the Free American Army.

01:04:08.176 --> 01:04:09.643
Three guys?

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.073
That's it?

01:04:11.346 --> 01:04:12.472
What good are three guys?

01:04:12.681 --> 01:04:14.080
Hey, shit-for-brains.

01:04:14.482 --> 01:04:16.109
You're sassing a United States Marine.

01:04:16.318 --> 01:04:19.810
All right, look, we're trying to link up
with a group of insurgents working the area.

01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:21.181
Call themselves Wolverines.

01:04:22.123 --> 01:04:24.318
- You ever hear of them?
- Yeah, we've heard of them.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.118
You here to help them out?

01:04:26.728 --> 01:04:30.289
No. Actually, we were hoping
they could help us out.

01:04:34.369 --> 01:04:36.234
We're camped just below here.

01:04:36.438 --> 01:04:37.871
We got clean water and bandages

01:04:37.973 --> 01:04:40.373
and another camp
about six miles west of here.

01:04:40.575 --> 01:04:43.135
We were gonna try and push on
after we ate.

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:45.740
We're the Wolverines.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.544
I was afraid of that.

01:04:56.024 --> 01:04:59.755
So how did we get here?
What happened to our defense?

01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:01.221
It went defunct.

01:05:01.463 --> 01:05:02.623
Shit-ified.

01:05:02.764 --> 01:05:04.061
There's a new class of weapon.

01:05:04.432 --> 01:05:06.866
It caused a massive electrical pulse.

01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:09.033
Everything went off-line
and never came back.

01:05:09.304 --> 01:05:11.329
Grids fried, subs drowned.

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:15.001
They mopped up by hitting cities
with tactical non-nuke warheads

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:18.004
and landed ground troops
where they needed strategic pressure.

01:05:18.213 --> 01:05:19.578
What about the Russians?

01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:21.461
Shit, they got the whole Eastern seaboard.

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:23.877
We know they supplied hardware
and aircraft,

01:05:23.985 --> 01:05:26.419
but North Korea locked down
the Pacific Northwest.

01:05:27.822 --> 01:05:29.153
So it's over?

01:05:29.257 --> 01:05:30.519
Over?

01:05:30.825 --> 01:05:32.383
What is this?

01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:34.221
A rifle.

01:05:34.362 --> 01:05:37.923
That's right, motard. A
marine and his rifle.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.935
It's the baddest shit-kicking weapon
in the world.

01:05:42.037 --> 01:05:45.268
And I'm still breathing, so it ain't over.

01:05:45.707 --> 01:05:47.072
Far from it.

01:05:47.275 --> 01:05:49.607
Lucky for us, they bit off
more than they could chew.

01:05:50.011 --> 01:05:52.172
A lot of this country is still free
and up for a fight.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.204
Hoorah.

01:05:53.315 --> 01:05:55.806
Michigan to Montana, Alabama to Arizona,

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:57.817
that's still free America right now.

01:05:58.019 --> 01:06:00.146
We're only 50, 60 miles from the border.

01:06:00.322 --> 01:06:01.448
That's right.

01:06:01.556 --> 01:06:03.820
And other places, too,
swinging back our way.

01:06:04.192 --> 01:06:05.682
Wide-open shooting war in Florida.

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.385
Texas-Mexican border
has been burning for weeks.

01:06:08.763 --> 01:06:11.197
All because of folks like you.

01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:15.633
You've made a difference. Hell, you...

01:06:16.638 --> 01:06:18.196
You are the difference.

01:06:22.777 --> 01:06:24.472
So how can we help?

01:06:24.779 --> 01:06:28.146
What we can't figure out is how come
they're not crippled by their own weapon.

01:06:28.483 --> 01:06:30.883
You guys ever see them using something
like this?

01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:35.247
Hey, Matt, is your phone still working?

01:06:52.941 --> 01:06:54.568
Well, <i>Semper Fi</i>, Wolverines.

01:06:55.477 --> 01:06:56.637
What is it?

01:06:57.178 --> 01:07:01.672
It's how they talk to each other.
A closed network for communication.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:03.283
So it can't be hacked.

01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:05.077
But if we had it,

01:07:05.286 --> 01:07:08.346
it'd be the foothold we need
to start pushing them out

01:07:08.556 --> 01:07:10.183
and take our homes back.

01:07:12.827 --> 01:07:14.317
And you want to steal it?

01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:16.558
Rapidly.

01:07:39.921 --> 01:07:41.752
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:07:52.167 --> 01:07:55.398
They've fortified the police station
with bunkers on all four sides.

01:07:55.637 --> 01:07:57.730
A couple of mobile structures
acting as barracks

01:07:57.939 --> 01:07:59.531
that house the off-duty personnel.

01:07:59.974 --> 01:08:03.068
There is at least 20 guys in there
at any one time.

01:08:03.278 --> 01:08:04.404
And a ton of firepower.

01:08:04.612 --> 01:08:06.671
I got a news flash for you.
There's no way in there.

01:08:06.781 --> 01:08:07.941
Oh, there's one.

01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:10.017
What, we jump?

01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:11.946
Yeah, that's the plan.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.987
That's not a plan.
That's a shit sandwich without the bread.

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:16.750
Cover me.

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:20.819
Shit!

01:08:29.136 --> 01:08:30.434
I hate these kids.

01:08:31.639 --> 01:08:32.867
Hate 'em.

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:47.845
Son of a bitch!

01:09:00.335 --> 01:09:02.997
Hodges, you're with me.
Smith, you grow roots up here.

01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:06.173
You hear anything that sounds
like Americans getting their asses kicked,

01:09:06.374 --> 01:09:09.366
you make damn sure those girls know
when it's their turn to dance.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:11.971
Any guesses where that little green box is?

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:13.612
Yeah.

01:09:14.482 --> 01:09:16.176
We're gonna follow the wire.

01:09:57.959 --> 01:09:59.756
Down! Down! Down!

01:10:03.398 --> 01:10:05.525
Welcome to shit's creek, motards.

01:10:18.079 --> 01:10:19.273
All right.

01:10:19.714 --> 01:10:21.807
Our wire just split
into three different directions.

01:10:22.283 --> 01:10:23.409
Nothing's easy.

01:10:23.618 --> 01:10:25.142
All right, here's the plan.

01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:28.982
You two, take the back stairs.
Follow the line down to the ground floor.

01:10:29.557 --> 01:10:32.321
Jed, Matt, you stay up here,
trace the other two.

01:10:32.794 --> 01:10:35.524
Hodges, you're with me.
We're going to secure the front door.

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:39.359
Let's find this thing
and get back to the hood.

01:10:39.567 --> 01:10:41.194
It's a good day to die, gentlemen.

01:10:42.303 --> 01:10:43.429
What did he say?

01:10:43.638 --> 01:10:47.802
Don't worry about it. Marines don't die.
They just go to hell and regroup.

01:10:49.177 --> 01:10:50.405
What did he say?

01:11:10.131 --> 01:11:11.325
Clear.

01:11:29.217 --> 01:11:31.617
Dude, they're not gonna keep
their uber box under the frigging couch!

01:11:31.753 --> 01:11:32.879
How do you know?

01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:35.854
It's a vital piece of military equipment,
not your porn stash.

01:11:37.058 --> 01:11:38.355
You got this.

01:12:01.449 --> 01:12:03.542
My wire goes to Cho's office.

01:12:03.751 --> 01:12:06.379
And he's home... Shit!

01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:14.888
This is about to get interesting.

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:16.597
Matty, where are you?

01:12:36.951 --> 01:12:38.145
Smith, you're on.

01:12:40.455 --> 01:12:42.821
C'mon, ladies, show us your guns.

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:05.637
Shit!

01:13:06.914 --> 01:13:07.881
Come on!

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:25.626
We gotta get out of here!

01:13:27.735 --> 01:13:28.929
Run!

01:13:38.479 --> 01:13:39.844
He was just here.

01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:52.320
Keep them away from the box.

01:14:10.812 --> 01:14:12.006
Shit!

01:14:19.086 --> 01:14:20.348
Not gonna happen.

01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:51.017
Grenade!

01:15:05.099 --> 01:15:06.225
Tanner!

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:15.248
- Get that thing out of here. I'll cover.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

01:16:15.269 --> 01:16:18.295
God damn it, Matty.
Get that thing out of here. Go!

01:17:32.113 --> 01:17:33.774
Matt Eckert!

01:17:55.169 --> 01:17:57.330
You fucked with the wrong family.

01:18:01.275 --> 01:18:02.902
Get this out of here, Robert.

01:18:08.182 --> 01:18:09.774
Where's the box?

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:11.008
It's safe.

01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:13.518
All right, let's get out of here.

01:18:24.365 --> 01:18:25.423
It's pretty deep.

01:18:25.533 --> 01:18:28.559
Yeah, but it doesn't hurt. It's okay.

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:31.137
Hey.

01:18:49.423 --> 01:18:51.015
Hey.

01:18:57.798 --> 01:18:58.992
I'm okay.

01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:07.896
I'll be right there.

01:19:10.772 --> 01:19:12.399
Collateral.

01:19:19.414 --> 01:19:21.575
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:23.411
Yeah. Sure.

01:19:27.422 --> 01:19:29.356
What's up?

01:19:29.591 --> 01:19:31.491
Nothing. I...

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.890
I was just thinking, you know, and...

01:19:37.799 --> 01:19:39.926
I'm not very good at this, man.

01:19:40.335 --> 01:19:41.700
Good at what?

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.575
Giving you props when you get it right.

01:19:50.545 --> 01:19:52.775
And letting you know that

01:19:53.748 --> 01:19:55.579
I'm proud of you.

01:20:04.593 --> 01:20:06.083
Yeah.

01:20:06.394 --> 01:20:08.624
Yes, Jed. That's not one of your strengths.

01:20:08.763 --> 01:20:12.221
- No.
- No, it's not.

01:20:21.209 --> 01:20:24.508
So, how about that beer now?

01:20:30.051 --> 01:20:31.575
Wow.

01:20:32.087 --> 01:20:34.555
My first one.

01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:40.818
Where's yours?

01:20:41.763 --> 01:20:43.458
She stole it from me.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.667
Go get it.

01:21:05.587 --> 01:21:08.078
Matt! Watch the back!

01:21:19.234 --> 01:21:21.600
Tanner! Cover me!

01:21:25.807 --> 01:21:27.172
Robert, get Erica out of here.

01:21:27.275 --> 01:21:29.971
- I'm not leaving without you!
- God damn it, do what I say, Robert!

01:21:30.145 --> 01:21:32.238
When you hit the deck, watch your ass.

01:21:34.349 --> 01:21:35.941
I'll catch up. Go!

01:21:43.725 --> 01:21:45.989
Help me! Jed!

01:21:46.695 --> 01:21:48.856
- Come on, Toni.
- We can't leave him!

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:50.327
Come on!

01:21:50.599 --> 01:21:52.829
God damn it, Toni.
We need you back in the fight.

01:21:52.934 --> 01:21:56.370
Come on! I know. I know.
Tanner! Can we get out your way?

01:21:56.471 --> 01:21:57.460
Make it quick.

01:21:57.606 --> 01:21:59.164
Go, go, go, go!

01:22:01.142 --> 01:22:03.042
Move your asses!

01:22:12.887 --> 01:22:14.218
Let's go!

01:22:22.964 --> 01:22:24.295
Smith!

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.815
How did they know?

01:23:24.559 --> 01:23:26.959
How did they know where we were, bro?

01:23:27.162 --> 01:23:28.720
- They must have followed us.
- No.

01:23:29.264 --> 01:23:30.754
No way they could track us.

01:23:39.407 --> 01:23:41.068
Daryl, lift up your jacket.

01:23:42.677 --> 01:23:44.304
Let me see this. Let me see it.

01:23:46.581 --> 01:23:48.310
Oh, shit.

01:23:48.817 --> 01:23:50.478
What is it?

01:23:50.952 --> 01:23:52.146
It's not a knife wound.

01:23:53.855 --> 01:23:55.117
They tagged him with something.

01:23:55.323 --> 01:23:56.915
Like what they do with animals.

01:23:57.525 --> 01:23:58.719
What?

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.359
They're tracking him?

01:24:01.196 --> 01:24:02.629
Daryl.

01:24:03.064 --> 01:24:04.122
You...

01:24:04.232 --> 01:24:05.631
- No.
- You led them right to us.

01:24:05.834 --> 01:24:08.894
- I didn't know!
- You led them right to us!

01:24:09.237 --> 01:24:10.795
Let go!

01:24:11.706 --> 01:24:13.196
You killed Jed!

01:24:15.677 --> 01:24:17.838
Matty, he killed Jed.

01:24:27.455 --> 01:24:30.185
You can cut it out of him, right, Robert?
Cut it out of him.

01:24:30.291 --> 01:24:31.952
There's no way. With what?

01:24:32.193 --> 01:24:33.558
Matt, we got to move.

01:24:34.329 --> 01:24:35.569
Let's just get back in the car.

01:24:35.663 --> 01:24:37.528
- Let's keep going.
- We can't.

01:24:39.267 --> 01:24:40.632
They'll find us.

01:24:40.969 --> 01:24:42.732
What else are we supposed to do?

01:24:51.679 --> 01:24:53.203
Robert.

01:24:53.414 --> 01:24:55.405
Get me some gear.

01:24:55.717 --> 01:24:56.775
What?

01:24:57.085 --> 01:24:58.643
They could be here any minute.

01:25:04.559 --> 01:25:05.992
Daryl.

01:25:18.473 --> 01:25:20.031
Can I borrow your SAW?

01:26:14.796 --> 01:26:18.425
So anyone want a lift back
to the land of the free?

01:26:18.633 --> 01:26:20.931
We got plenty of room.

01:26:22.737 --> 01:26:24.705
I'm sorry for the loss of your men.

01:26:25.607 --> 01:26:27.302
We've all lost something, Matt.

01:26:29.777 --> 01:26:31.176
You've done enough.

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:35.374
You've done more than enough.

01:26:36.451 --> 01:26:38.510
I appreciate that.

01:26:45.093 --> 01:26:46.924
The fact is

01:26:48.596 --> 01:26:50.962
we're not doing too bad

01:26:51.165 --> 01:26:53.326
for a bunch of kids.

01:26:54.035 --> 01:26:56.128
We're going to fight.

01:26:56.337 --> 01:26:59.773
And we're going to keep fighting
because it's easier now.

01:26:59.974 --> 01:27:02.943
And we're used to it.

01:27:03.144 --> 01:27:06.545
The rest of you are going to
have a tougher choice.

01:27:06.748 --> 01:27:10.149
Because we're not going to sell it to you.

01:27:10.351 --> 01:27:13.047
It's too ugly for that.

01:27:13.788 --> 01:27:15.722
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

01:27:15.924 --> 01:27:18.757
when you're fighting for your family,

01:27:19.494 --> 01:27:21.462
it all hurts a little less

01:27:22.997 --> 01:27:24.726
and makes a little more sense.

01:27:26.801 --> 01:27:31.295
<i>Because for them, this is just a place.</i>

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.132
<i>But for us, this is our home.</i>

01:27:36.344 --> 01:27:37.971
Wolverines!

01:27:38.179 --> 01:27:39.305
Wolverines!

01:27:39.514 --> 01:27:40.981
Wolverines!
