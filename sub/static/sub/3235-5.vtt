Jesse's with me today,
so what you need to do

07:11.183 --> 07:13.818
is to go back to your lab
and get on with the cook.

07:13.853 --> 07:16.321

09:01.128 --> 09:02.395
I don't.

you better shoot straight,

[Hank] This freaking guy,

13:29.647 --> 13:31.715

or something.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.284
[chuckling]

13:34.318 --> 13:35.985
Who does this, you know?

13:36.019 --> 13:37.419
Your boy Heisenberg.

13:37.454 --> 13:38.754
Thought we had him already.

13:38.788 --> 13:40.789
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

13:40.824 --> 13:41.824
Yeah, no.

13:41.858 --> 13:43.191
Getz busted him
a few months back.

13:43.226 --> 13:45.394
Yeah, well, no offense

13:45.428 --> 13:47.096
to Detective
Doogie Howser there,

13:47.130 --> 13:51.033
but all he caught
was a dipshit lifer

13:51.068 --> 13:52.936
by the name
of Jimmy In-N-Out.

13:52.970 --> 13:55.772
This one--
He's your Heisenberg?

13:55.807 --> 13:58.075
Yeah, I believe he is.

13:58.109 --> 13:59.476
So what are you thinking?

13:59.510 --> 14:01.512
Rival drug gang
taking out the mastermind?

14:01.546 --> 14:04.781
Any names I should check out?

14:04.816 --> 14:06.349
I wish I could help you there.

14:06.384 --> 14:08.818
Only two people I know
connected with the blue stuff.

14:08.853 --> 14:12.822
Uh, one is a beanie-wearing
jizz stain

14:12.857 --> 14:14.558
by the name
of Brandon Mayhew--

14:14.592 --> 14:16.193
Street name, uh, Badger.

14:16.227 --> 14:18.962
Definitely another player.

14:18.997 --> 14:23.833
The other one
is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.

14:25.636 --> 14:26.870
He and I have a history.

14:26.904 --> 14:29.506
Yeah.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.709
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

14:32.844 --> 14:34.478
That would surprise me.

14:34.512 --> 14:36.813
Well, we got a composite

14:36.847 --> 14:38.781
of a person of interest.

14:38.816 --> 14:41.617
It's a guy the neighbors saw

14:41.651 --> 14:44.687
at Boetticher's place
right after the shooting.

14:46.257 --> 14:49.226
Eh...sorry.

14:49.260 --> 14:50.928
No, hang on to it,
just in case.

14:50.962 --> 14:53.431
Then we got a couple of
prints we're hoping to I.D.

14:53.465 --> 14:54.899
If I get any kind of hit,

14:54.933 --> 14:56.701
I'll keep you
in the loop on that.

14:56.735 --> 14:59.738
You know, uh, Tim,

14:59.772 --> 15:02.608
look, I appreciate
what you're doing, really--

15:02.642 --> 15:04.509
Uh, you know, keeping me
involved and all,

15:04.543 --> 15:07.178
but, uh, you know,

15:07.212 --> 15:12.516
finding this guy Heisenberg
dead like this...

15:12.550 --> 15:16.486
I have to say, it, uh...

15:16.520 --> 15:18.388
kind of feels like closure
to me, you know?

15:18.422 --> 15:22.459
Hank, you really are
a big help here.

15:22.493 --> 15:24.261
No, I know.
I get it, really.

15:24.295 --> 15:26.530
But I'm done.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.607
[coughing]

16:22.122 --> 16:23.589
Oh, no.

16:31.197 --> 16:32.897
You don't need to do that.

16:34.233 --> 16:36.734
This is why I'm out here,
right?

16:36.768 --> 16:38.802
To be, like, your backup?

16:40.405 --> 16:41.605
Uh-huh.

16:41.639 --> 16:45.309
So if I'm out here
in a guard-type capacity

16:45.343 --> 16:46.444
to watch over the money,

16:46.478 --> 16:49.914
that means I need, like,
a gun, right?

16:49.949 --> 16:51.016
Nope.

17:06.934 --> 17:09.301
I mean, isn't that,
like, completely idiotic

17:09.336 --> 17:10.904
for me to be out here
without a gun?

17:10.938 --> 17:12.705
I mean, you haven't said dick

17:12.740 --> 17:14.074
about what I'm supposed
to be doing here,

17:14.108 --> 17:15.675
and I'm supposed
to do it without a gun?

17:15.710 --> 17:18.311
How does that even make sense?

17:20.515 --> 17:21.548
What?

17:21.583 --> 17:23.148

23:17.075 --> 23:18.142
Ah.

23:19.644 --> 23:20.911
Mr. White.

23:21.913 --> 23:22.879
Best of luck.

23:22.913 --> 23:23.913
Thank you.

23:25.282 --> 23:27.750
I'm bringing my car over
first thing next week

23:27.784 --> 23:28.918
for a wash and wax.

23:28.952 --> 23:30.252
Oh, well, we'll
be looking for you.

23:30.287 --> 23:32.021
I'll be there.
[Skyler chuckles]

23:32.055 --> 23:33.022
Thank you again.

23:33.056 --> 23:34.023
You're welcome.

23:34.057 --> 23:35.057
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

23:40.096 --> 23:42.864
Wow. It's official.

23:45.301 --> 23:46.568
How are you feeling?

23:50.373 --> 23:52.408
I'm...

23:52.442 --> 23:54.310
well, I'm--
How do you feel?

23:54.344 --> 23:57.814
Uh...nervous.

23:59.451 --> 24:00.751
Scared.

24:02.354 --> 24:04.454
This is a big step, Walt.

24:04.489 --> 24:06.524
If we don't
do this right--

24:06.558 --> 24:08.225
We'll be fine.

24:08.260 --> 24:10.227
We will?

24:14.766 --> 24:16.333
Tell me again.

24:20.171 --> 24:24.341
We will be fine.
Believe it.

24:27.311 --> 24:28.878
If we're
going to do this--

24:28.913 --> 24:30.847
I mean, we're really
going to do this--

24:30.881 --> 24:33.949
Then we have to
promise each other

24:33.984 --> 24:36.018
no more secrets.

24:38.354 --> 24:41.422
There can't be any
mistakes like before.

24:41.457 --> 24:44.426
There has to be
complete honesty.

24:44.460 --> 24:46.995
I'm all for that.

24:48.331 --> 24:49.331
Good.

24:50.699 --> 24:53.034
Well, then, uh,

24:53.068 --> 24:54.970
how about a drink to celebrate?

24:55.004 --> 24:56.304
Well--

24:56.339 --> 24:58.740
Well, we own a big-ass
car wash now.

24:58.775 --> 25:01.543
We do. I guess
that merits a celebration.

25:01.578 --> 25:02.945
Nothing too expensive.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.747
Right. Right.

25:04.781 --> 25:06.849
- Non-fancy liquor it is.
- Yes.

25:06.883 --> 25:09.085
Just as long
as it gets the job done.

25:09.119 --> 25:10.120
Oop.

25:11.389 --> 25:12.456
[beep]

25:14.792 --> 25:17.728
<i>[Walt] Uh, it's me.</i>

25:17.762 --> 25:19.296
<i>I just wanted to say</i>

25:19.330 --> 25:22.165
<i>that I was thinking
about you and the kids,</i>

25:22.200 --> 25:25.034
<i>and, uh...</i>

25:25.069 --> 25:26.836
<i>I love you.</i>

25:26.871 --> 25:28.372
[beep]

25:51.094 --> 25:52.194
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

25:52.228 --> 25:53.195
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

25:53.229 --> 25:54.229
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

26:05.139 --> 26:06.907
[moaning, gasping]

26:15.592 --> 26:17.674
[ birds chirping ]

26:21.474 --> 26:25.011
The sheets, they smell
different than I remember.

26:25.045 --> 26:26.779
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

26:28.349 --> 26:29.583
Oh.

26:29.617 --> 26:31.285
New fabric softener.

26:31.319 --> 26:32.920
Mmm.

26:32.954 --> 26:34.622
Mm, I like it.

26:34.656 --> 26:36.557
[chuckle]

26:36.591 --> 26:38.292
I, uh...

26:38.326 --> 26:41.494
also got a new haircut.

26:41.529 --> 26:43.196
Don't know if you--

26:43.231 --> 26:45.699
Oh, yes, I-- I was
going to say something.

26:45.733 --> 26:47.501
Were you, really?

26:47.535 --> 26:50.337
[laughing]

26:50.371 --> 26:51.972
I do like it.

26:54.209 --> 26:55.676
Thanks.

26:58.880 --> 27:02.884
So, um, dinner tomorrow night?

27:02.918 --> 27:07.823
I told Marie that we'd
come over and eat with them.

27:07.857 --> 27:11.527
Uh, think maybe you'll be free?

27:14.597 --> 27:15.798
Yeah.

27:17.099 --> 27:18.399
Yeah, we can do that.

27:18.434 --> 27:20.235
That'll--
That'll be nice.

27:21.904 --> 27:23.471
Good.

27:26.475 --> 27:28.242
Marie says
it's about the only thing

27:28.277 --> 27:30.578
that'll get Hank
out of his room.

27:32.180 --> 27:33.847
[Walt Junior] Mom.

27:33.882 --> 27:35.683
Ohh.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.327
Hey, Mom, Dad.

27:45.361 --> 27:46.361
[Walt] Hi, son.

27:49.566 --> 27:51.500
Where are you?

27:51.535 --> 27:53.469
Uh, we're--
We're back here.

27:53.504 --> 27:55.037
We'll be out in a minute.

27:56.539 --> 27:57.940
Ohh...

28:02.011 --> 28:03.311
[whispering]
He knows that you're here.

28:03.345 --> 28:06.380
I'm parked in the driveway.

28:06.414 --> 28:07.715
Oh. This is going to make

28:07.749 --> 28:10.184
for some very interesting
dinner conversation.

28:11.586 --> 28:13.920
He's definitely going to ask

28:13.955 --> 28:16.223
about our living situation now.

28:16.257 --> 28:17.491
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

28:19.394 --> 28:22.129
Maybe, uh...

28:22.163 --> 28:24.965
maybe you should move back in,

28:24.999 --> 28:26.333
you know,

28:26.368 --> 28:29.604
just so it's, uh, easier
to explain to everyone.

28:31.807 --> 28:33.175
You think?

28:38.848 --> 28:40.615
[alarm beeps]

28:56.366 --> 28:58.935
I have to get back to work.

28:58.969 --> 29:01.838
You know, schedule.

29:01.872 --> 29:03.539
Yeah.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.744
Whoa. Ohh--

30:14.580 --> 30:15.580
Ahh--

30:17.283 --> 30:18.884
Damn it.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.285
Hey!

30:20.319 --> 30:23.087
Hey! This is a two-man job!

30:23.121 --> 30:24.354
I can't do it alone!

30:24.389 --> 30:26.623
I'm done! That's it!
Finished!

30:26.658 --> 30:29.159
Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

30:40.804 --> 30:42.839
[door opens, closes]

30:43.874 --> 30:45.541
[footsteps]

30:48.679 --> 30:49.745
Jesse?

30:54.818 --> 30:56.585
Where's Jesse?

30:56.620 --> 30:58.387
I need him.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.021
You people have me down here

31:00.056 --> 31:03.191
trying to complete
a two-man operation by myself!

31:03.225 --> 31:04.659
It's unacceptable.

31:04.693 --> 31:07.728
It's dangerous
and counterproductive.

31:09.464 --> 31:12.366
Jesse operates
the forklift, not me.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.301
That's just one of the many,

31:14.336 --> 31:15.536
many things
he does around the lab

31:15.570 --> 31:17.104
that keeps us on schedule,

31:17.139 --> 31:19.574
so I suggest that you
get him back down here

31:19.608 --> 31:20.742
as soon as you p--

31:20.776 --> 31:23.145
Are you listening to me?

31:23.179 --> 31:24.413
Hello!

31:37.662 --> 31:38.996
Where do you want it?

32:05.225 --> 32:08.628
This is it, right?
Last stop?

32:08.662 --> 32:09.996
Last stop?

32:11.132 --> 32:12.366
Hey, I've been counting, yo.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.867
No more pickups after--

32:30.049 --> 32:32.484
Fallacies...

32:32.518 --> 32:34.385
fallacies.

32:59.347 --> 33:02.816
Fallacies, fallacies.

33:02.851 --> 33:06.887
One for you, two for me.

33:06.921 --> 33:10.757
Fallacies, fallacies...

33:32.546 --> 33:33.880
Ohh!

33:41.789 --> 33:43.256
Ohh.

34:20.697 --> 34:24.067
Yeah. I'm gonna need
to be picked up.

34:24.101 --> 34:25.402
Now.

34:27.606 --> 34:29.373
Garcia's on Central.

34:29.407 --> 34:32.141
Honk once. I'll meet you
in the parking lot.

34:38.317 --> 34:39.317
Cancel that.

34:48.994 --> 34:50.762
Hey, this dude--

34:50.795 --> 34:53.031
This dude was coming
right at me

34:53.065 --> 34:54.933
with a--
With a shotgun.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.701
All right? They, like,
blocked the alley,

34:56.735 --> 34:58.570
and they were going
to rip us off, man.

34:58.605 --> 34:59.838
I didn't have a choice, okay?

34:59.873 --> 35:02.608
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car,

35:02.642 --> 35:05.611
and just-- [sigh]

35:05.645 --> 35:06.979
I saw.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.916
Ah, Jesus.

35:11.952 --> 35:13.452
I just--

35:13.486 --> 35:15.087
I don't know.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.764
Go ahead, kid.

35:27.534 --> 35:28.768
Smoke up.

35:49.531 --> 35:51.499
Hmm.

35:57.006 --> 35:58.706
Mmm.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.817
Good morning.

36:10.852 --> 36:13.220
Hey. Good morning, son.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.589
You want me
to pour you some juice?

36:15.623 --> 36:17.858
I'll take coffee.

36:19.794 --> 36:21.661
Didn't know you started
drinking coffee.

36:21.696 --> 36:26.066
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces, too,

36:26.100 --> 36:27.901
all by myself.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.903
Go grab a mug.

36:38.414 --> 36:40.349
Milk? Sugar?

36:40.383 --> 36:42.851
Just black.

36:42.886 --> 36:45.121
Black. I like it.

36:47.624 --> 36:49.958
Uh, hey, Dad, I, uh...

36:49.993 --> 36:53.195
I-- I just got to say, um...

36:53.229 --> 36:54.796
I-- I just wanted to say

36:54.831 --> 36:57.132
that it's really cool
to have you here.

36:59.235 --> 37:00.869
Thank you, son.

37:00.904 --> 37:02.971
It's cool to be back home.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.574
It just feels--

37:05.609 --> 37:10.046
Mom said you're moving
back in, uh, this Tuesday.

37:12.150 --> 37:16.087
She-- She said that?

37:16.121 --> 37:18.389
Yeah.

37:18.424 --> 37:21.359
Tuesday, is it? Huh.

37:23.229 --> 37:24.395
How about that?

37:42.379 --> 37:45.615
[pounding]

37:48.185 --> 37:50.020
[pounding]

37:52.557 --> 37:53.490
Jesse.

37:53.525 --> 37:55.326
Jesse!

37:56.395 --> 37:57.762
Yo, what's up?

37:57.796 --> 37:59.664
What are you doing?

37:59.699 --> 38:01.166
Uh, breaking ice.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.367
I mean, what are you--

38:02.402 --> 38:04.002
What are you doing here?

38:04.037 --> 38:05.137
Where's your car?

38:05.171 --> 38:07.339
Mike dropped me off.

38:19.451 --> 38:20.518
Jesse.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.854
Jesse!

38:24.690 --> 38:26.958
What happened yesterday?
Where were you?

38:26.992 --> 38:29.460
I was out with Mike
helping him make pickups.

38:29.494 --> 38:30.761
Picking up what?

38:30.796 --> 38:32.730
Cash. Dead drops.

38:32.764 --> 38:36.634
Mike made the pickups,
and I guarded them.

38:36.668 --> 38:38.503
You?

38:38.537 --> 38:39.871
Guarded Mike?

38:40.973 --> 38:42.607
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

38:42.641 --> 38:44.675
Hey, you know what?
Two dudes tried to rob us,

38:44.710 --> 38:46.911
and I saved the stash.
I took care of business,

38:46.945 --> 38:50.014
just like I'm taking care
of business right now.

38:50.048 --> 38:51.482
You want to stand there
dicking around,

38:51.517 --> 38:54.152
or you want to suit up
and get to work?

38:54.186 --> 38:56.789
Get in gear, yo,
if you want to do this

38:56.823 --> 38:58.724
because I'm meeting up
with Mike this afternoon.

38:58.758 --> 39:00.826
What, again? Why?

39:00.861 --> 39:03.429
Guess I have two jobs now.

39:06.065 --> 39:07.833
[pounding]

39:22.680 --> 39:23.981
<i>May I take your order?</i>

39:31.457 --> 39:32.824
Any injuries?

39:32.859 --> 39:35.994
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

39:36.996 --> 39:39.665
It all went like you
thought it would,

39:39.700 --> 39:41.968
more or less.

39:42.002 --> 39:43.937
I will, of course,
reimburse you

39:43.971 --> 39:45.705
to the damage to your vehicles.

39:45.739 --> 39:46.773
Hmm.

39:49.076 --> 39:50.042
Questions?

39:50.077 --> 39:53.612
Uh-huh.
More than a few, yeah.

39:53.646 --> 39:55.647
But I know better than to ask.

39:57.650 --> 40:02.053
Anyway, it was like you wanted.

40:02.087 --> 40:03.888
The kid's a hero.

40:21.943 --> 40:23.044
[Marie]
Poo-poo-poo-poo-poo--

40:23.078 --> 40:24.712
[Skyler] Just the idea
of owning a car wash

40:24.746 --> 40:26.380
seems daunting,
but I had to warn myself--

40:26.415 --> 40:27.882
Who is just the most beautiful
little girl in the world?

40:27.916 --> 40:29.016
I think it's you.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.951
So coming into
a business like this

40:30.986 --> 40:33.053
that's up and running,
fully operational,

40:33.088 --> 40:35.323
puts us way ahead of the game.

40:35.357 --> 40:36.791
You know, we're
still going to have

40:36.825 --> 40:38.058
some change over time--

40:38.093 --> 40:39.527
I think it's you.
Yeah, I do.

40:39.561 --> 40:41.095
But we do have
a staff in place,

40:41.129 --> 40:44.064
so, you know, luckily,
we'll be able to hold on

40:44.099 --> 40:45.766
to most of Bogdan's employees.

40:45.801 --> 40:49.703
We might lose a few to the Ultra
Wash across town, though.

40:49.738 --> 40:51.371
They're making a grab, I hear.

40:51.406 --> 40:52.840
You going to put
the kid to work?

40:52.874 --> 40:54.174
I got school.

40:54.209 --> 40:55.309
I'm not talking about you.

40:55.343 --> 40:56.577
I'm talking about
your baby sister.

40:56.611 --> 40:58.045
I wouldn't let you near my car.

40:58.079 --> 41:00.881
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
you guys.

41:00.915 --> 41:03.550
You should put Holly
on the sign.

41:03.584 --> 41:05.618
Like a mascot?

41:05.653 --> 41:07.620
Like the Gerber baby.

41:07.654 --> 41:09.555
I would get my car
washed there every day

41:09.589 --> 41:10.823
if I saw her face out front.

41:10.857 --> 41:11.957
What about me?

41:11.991 --> 41:13.658
The goal is to bring
customers in,

41:13.693 --> 41:15.126
not scare them away, so--

41:15.161 --> 41:16.194
[laughter]

41:18.630 --> 41:20.665
Walt, there's another
bottle in the kitchen.

41:20.699 --> 41:21.732
Just help yourself.

41:21.767 --> 41:23.034
Ah. Good.

41:25.037 --> 41:27.239
Uh, maybe we could
roll uncle Hank

41:27.273 --> 41:28.407
through the car wash.

41:28.441 --> 41:29.675
He could be the first customer.

41:29.709 --> 41:30.976
[laughter]

41:31.010 --> 41:33.345
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

41:33.380 --> 41:34.513
[laughter]

41:34.548 --> 41:35.648
[Hank] See this, son?

41:35.682 --> 41:37.116
I got your wipe-down
right here, pal.

41:37.151 --> 41:39.552
[Skyler] Hank, can you just
maybe get through one meal

41:39.586 --> 41:41.821
without you saying
something disgusting?

41:41.856 --> 41:44.291
[Marie] So what are you going
to do with Holly all day?

41:44.325 --> 41:45.692
You can't take her to work

41:45.726 --> 41:49.395
with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

41:49.429 --> 41:50.396
[Skyler] Marie--

41:50.430 --> 41:52.965
[Marie]
What? That can't be safe.

41:52.999 --> 41:54.366
[Skyler] Fortunately, there is,

41:54.400 --> 41:56.034
just five minutes away
from the car wash,

41:56.068 --> 41:59.237
there is the top child care
center in the city.

41:59.271 --> 42:01.639
The National Child Care
Association

42:01.674 --> 42:04.409
gives it really high ratings,
so that's quite a relief,

42:04.443 --> 42:07.713
and, you know, it's just
a walk away if we need it.

42:07.747 --> 42:08.981
[Hank] I got to tell you,

42:09.015 --> 42:11.984
I'm just-- I'm really,
really impressed.

42:12.018 --> 42:14.887
I mean,
you came together on this,

42:14.922 --> 42:17.190
and I'm really happy
that it's working out for you.

42:17.225 --> 42:18.191
[Skyler] Thanks.

42:18.226 --> 42:19.259
It was a little scary,

42:19.294 --> 42:21.261
but it, uh, needed to be done.

42:21.296 --> 42:24.231
And, uh, we get possession
of the keys tomorrow.

42:24.266 --> 42:25.666
[Marie] Oh, that's awesome.

42:25.700 --> 42:26.733
[Skyler] Yeah.

42:26.767 --> 42:28.201
[Walt Junior]
I can't wait to see

42:28.236 --> 42:30.069
what kind of car
I'll get for my birthday,

42:30.104 --> 42:32.105
now with all this money
rolling in.

42:32.139 --> 42:33.973
[Marie] I think you've been
spending too much time

42:34.007 --> 42:35.241
around your uncle Hank.

42:35.275 --> 42:37.042
[Walt Junior] The squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

42:37.076 --> 42:38.310
Right, uncle Hank?

42:38.344 --> 42:39.978
[Hank] Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

42:40.013 --> 42:41.780
[laughter]

42:41.814 --> 42:43.815
[Hank] Hey, uh, Nick the Greek,

42:43.850 --> 42:45.484
you going to share
that bottle or what?

42:45.518 --> 42:47.253
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

42:47.287 --> 42:48.587
[Walt Junior]
Who's Nick the Greek?

42:48.622 --> 42:50.823
Nick the Greek. He was
a famous big-time card player.

42:50.858 --> 42:52.325
Hank, that's not funny.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.660
What? It's a compliment.

42:53.694 --> 42:55.128
Well, that's even worse, then.

42:55.162 --> 42:58.599
You're giving positive
reinforcement to behavior

42:58.633 --> 43:02.136
that Walt is working
very, very hard to change.

43:02.171 --> 43:03.738
Right, Skyler?

43:03.772 --> 43:05.440
Yeah.

43:05.474 --> 43:07.008
I don't see how it's bad, Dad,

43:07.043 --> 43:09.244
just raking in
the beaucoup bucks now.

43:09.279 --> 43:10.513
You know, I just, uh, think

43:10.547 --> 43:12.515
maybe we could
change the subject?

43:12.549 --> 43:15.619
Yeah. Sure. You know.

43:15.653 --> 43:17.588
Absolutely.

43:17.623 --> 43:20.725
Hey, uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at

43:20.759 --> 43:23.361
with that crazy singing guy?

43:23.395 --> 43:25.763
Ah, I'm off that.

43:25.798 --> 43:28.332
I-- I gave my assessment
to the APD, and I'm done.

43:28.367 --> 43:31.268
The case of the crazy
singing guy. Hmm.

43:31.303 --> 43:33.471
Sounds like an Encyclopedia
Brown story, doesn't it?

43:33.505 --> 43:36.774
Crazy is-- Is-- Is, uh,
is the wrong word.

43:36.809 --> 43:38.609
This guy Gale Boetticher,

43:38.644 --> 43:40.645
he was, uh, he was eccentric.

43:40.679 --> 43:43.147
I mean, a real character,
you know?

43:43.181 --> 43:46.283
He's, uh, he's dead now,
you know.

43:46.317 --> 43:47.952
[Skyler]
Huh. Who was he?

43:47.986 --> 43:49.787
[Walt Junior]
He was a meth cook.

43:49.821 --> 43:52.056
[Hank] Uh, he was a meth chef.

43:52.090 --> 43:54.692
[chuckle] I mean,
we're talking five stars--

43:54.726 --> 43:57.628
Candles and white tablecloths.

43:57.663 --> 43:59.530
Hey, I can't believe
these words

43:59.564 --> 44:00.731
are gonna come out of my mouth,

44:00.766 --> 44:05.736
but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

44:05.770 --> 44:09.940
I mean, uh, boy, if you
applied that big brain of his

44:09.974 --> 44:11.475
to something good,
I don't know,

44:11.509 --> 44:13.377
who knows what could have
helped humanity

44:13.411 --> 44:14.645
or something like that,
you know?

44:14.679 --> 44:17.014
I mean, how many actual
geniuses are there

44:17.048 --> 44:18.515
in the world, right?

44:18.550 --> 44:21.185
If he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction,

44:21.219 --> 44:22.920
who knows?

44:22.954 --> 44:27.090
Hank, not to tell you
your business,

44:27.125 --> 44:30.560
but I'm not sure I agree.

44:30.595 --> 44:31.795
What do you mean?

44:31.829 --> 44:32.829
Well, I mean,

44:32.864 --> 44:34.130
you showed me that notebook

44:34.165 --> 44:36.099
and from what
I saw--

44:36.133 --> 44:38.702
And this is just
my humble opinion--

44:38.736 --> 44:42.371
From what I saw
on those papers...

44:42.406 --> 44:44.106
genius?

44:46.009 --> 44:47.710
Not so much.

44:47.744 --> 44:50.246
I mean, there was no reasoning,

44:50.281 --> 44:52.048
no deductions in those pages.

44:52.082 --> 44:55.317
To my eye, all this brilliance

44:55.352 --> 44:57.319
looks like nothing more

44:57.353 --> 45:01.724
than just simple
rote copying--

45:01.758 --> 45:04.860
Probably of
someone else's work.

45:06.496 --> 45:09.966
Believe me, I've been around
enough students to know.

45:13.104 --> 45:17.708
Ah, this genius of yours...

45:17.742 --> 45:21.279
maybe he's still out there.

45:33.358 --> 45:34.658
Hank.

45:34.693 --> 45:35.893
Hey, babe.

45:37.262 --> 45:39.130
Uh, Tim stopped by.

45:39.165 --> 45:41.099
He brought over some file boxes

45:41.133 --> 45:42.500
on that case.

45:42.534 --> 45:44.536
Thought I'd take another peek.

45:44.570 --> 45:45.937
That's great.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.941
Sorry about the mess.

45:48.975 --> 45:50.643
No, no, no. Don't be.

45:52.479 --> 45:54.380
You want me
to make some coffee?

45:54.414 --> 45:55.948
Yeah.

45:55.982 --> 45:58.284
Yeah, that would be good.

46:27.247 --> 46:28.881
Hmm.

46:29.883 --> 46:31.184
You find something?

46:33.087 --> 46:37.324
Oh, just this--
This guy I'm looking at.

46:37.358 --> 46:40.861
You know, everything
he-- He-- He buys and eats

46:40.895 --> 46:45.465
is organic, fair trade, vegan.

46:49.837 --> 46:52.505
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?

46:55.542 --> 46:59.000
