<i>[Daniel] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:03.803 --> 00:07.603
- Why are you stalking me?
- Excuse me? I am not stalking you.

00:07.674 --> 00:11.405
I am monitoring an illegal immigrant
who is a flight risk.

00:11.478 --> 00:14.447
- What is this?
- A tracking device.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.641
I'm not one of your flying monkeys.

00:16.716 --> 00:20.174
Don't cross me, sweetheart,
because you'll lose.

00:20.253 --> 00:23.780
You're here because of me,
because of what I did.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.484
I'm turning myself in.

00:25.558 --> 00:29.460
Listen to me, Wilhelmina. You are
not getting your hands on this company.

00:29.529 --> 00:34.262
The only person running
this magazine will be a Meade.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.235
- Alex won.
- I'm sorry.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.362
If Alex wants to take over, let him.

00:39.439 --> 00:42.431
I've got lots of partying
to catch up on.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.044
[Betty] Good morning, Amanda.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.645
Oh, hey, Betty.
I was just thinking about you.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.314
Really?

00:58.258 --> 00:59.885
That's nice.

00:59.959 --> 01:03.053
Wow, they're even bigger
than I remember.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.059
[Phone rings]

01:07.100 --> 01:09.091
Daniel Meade's office.

01:09.169 --> 01:14.129
Oh, no, I'm sorry, he's not here
right now. He's in a breakfast meeting.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.607
[Woman giggles]

01:16.676 --> 01:18.405
Daniel Meade's office.

01:18.478 --> 01:22.608
Oh, no, I'm sorry, he's all tied up.

01:23.516 --> 01:26.007
Daniel, it's me.
You got to get over here.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.384
Alexis is totally taking over.

01:28.455 --> 01:31.185
If you're there, pick up, please.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.952
All right, I guess you're out!

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.702 --> 01:45.899
Hi! Can I help you?

01:45.972 --> 01:48.634
Admiring the inner sanctum
of the feckless prince.

01:48.708 --> 01:53.577
As the empire dissolves, even the
cushion on the bone-white chaise

01:53.646 --> 01:55.876
sags with defeat.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.976
Wait a minute. I know that hat.
You're Quincy Combs.

02:00.053 --> 02:03.921
- Writing that book about the Meades.
- It's a critic too.

02:03.990 --> 02:09.086
Tell me, would this blind item about
a certain magazine editor seen humping

02:09.162 --> 02:11.596
- under the Peter Pan statue...
- It wasn't him!

02:11.664 --> 02:15.259
- Time for you to go.
- Oh, my, you are feisty.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.963
- And I bite too!
- Do not underestimate me.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.028
You may guard the gates,

02:20.106 --> 02:23.303
but I've taken down kings,
presidents, the electric car.

02:23.376 --> 02:27.107
Daniel Meade does not
stand a chance against me!

02:28.581 --> 02:30.105
Go.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.318
Higher.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.821
I said higher.

02:35.889 --> 02:38.790
- I'll be giving you a pelvic exam.
- Just pin it.

02:38.858 --> 02:42.294
Ooh! Well, fill my bucket
with nothing but thighs.

02:42.362 --> 02:44.990
Relax, colonel,
we all know you prefer nuggets.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.862
That'll be chicken ruined for me.
I'll get you shoes.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.596
Bradford won't be able
to keep his hands off you.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.160
- The idea.
- Six months,

02:52.238 --> 02:55.969
you'll be running Meade Publications.
A year, a Latin American country.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.339
These should work.

02:57.410 --> 03:01.608
[Gasps] You got invited to Prague!

03:01.681 --> 03:05.811
I would kill to go to this club.
How did C get on the A list?

03:05.885 --> 03:08.945
I guess when you're one of the
"Top 10 Designers to Watch,"

03:09.022 --> 03:12.185
people in this city want
to get to know you.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.192
You have a hard time
saying "thank you"?

03:14.260 --> 03:16.922
- Not when I mean it, no.
- Listen, McMartyr,

03:16.996 --> 03:19.021
you knew what you were getting into,

03:19.098 --> 03:22.329
so spare me the conscience
and enjoy the spotlight.

03:22.402 --> 03:26.862
Because it can all go away.
Just like that.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.770
[Constance] Hold still, Nacho.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.542
- [Device beeps]
- [Ignacio winces]

03:35.648 --> 03:39.379
Ooh... Looks like somebody's
got a little boo-boo.

03:39.452 --> 03:43.718
- I tried wearing it under my socks.
- My idea. It was ruining his pant line.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.057
[Sighs]

03:47.493 --> 03:50.587
Good news, I'm free. Bad news,
I got to take out the garbage.

03:50.663 --> 03:53.097
I'm sorry, Nacho.
I was just doing my job.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.293
I didn't realize
it included torturing me.

03:55.368 --> 03:59.270
I thought you were a flight risk.
I was doing it for your own good.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.933
I will go the extra mile
to make sure my clients

04:02.008 --> 04:06.809
- become citizens of the U.S. Of A.
- Is she gonna give us another flag?

04:06.879 --> 04:09.973
When do I get to meet my lawyer?
My court date's a month away.

04:10.049 --> 04:12.210
- You haven't heard from him yet?
- No.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.120
I'll call Jerry to see if he can
swing by my place, so you can meet him.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.214
Your place?

04:19.024 --> 04:22.961
Look, Constance,
I just... feel better if...

04:23.029 --> 04:25.224
If what? You don't trust me?

04:25.298 --> 04:28.597
- Of course I trust you.
- Listen, Ignacio.

04:28.668 --> 04:32.934
I admit, I had a thing for you.
I don't go blonde for just anyone.

04:33.006 --> 04:33.995
But that's over.

04:35.975 --> 04:40.344
Here's my address.
Make sure you bring some flowers.

04:40.413 --> 04:44.782
It's a joke! You must think you're the
only chip in the bag. [laughs]

04:45.652 --> 04:48.450
- Bye, Hilda.
- Bye, Constance.

04:48.521 --> 04:50.284
I love her.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.519
OK, there is no way
you are going to her house.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.891
Hilda, I need to meet the lawyer.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.590
In an office, with
fluorescent lights and witnesses.

04:58.665 --> 05:02.123
I'm not making any waves.
I'm too close to getting my green card.

05:02.201 --> 05:05.728
- Papi!
- Hilda, I can handle my own affairs.

05:11.277 --> 05:14.007
Daniel, where have you been?
It's almost two.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.049
Already? Whoa.
Got any messages for me?

05:17.116 --> 05:19.050
Yes, Becks called to say,

05:19.118 --> 05:22.610
"Congratulations on getting
into Tabitha's gift bag."

05:22.689 --> 05:27.092
Ew. I just got that. Have you by any
chance taken a look at Page Six today?

05:28.361 --> 05:32.092
That's the Peter Pan statue. I thought
it was some creepy kid watching us.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.463
Daniel, there are people following you.

05:34.534 --> 05:38.698
Just earlier today, I caught
Quincy Combs snooping in your office.

05:38.771 --> 05:41.797
- Quincy Combs? Rapper?
- No, celebrity trasher.

05:41.874 --> 05:46.038
He's the guy who wrote those books
on Kathie Lee, Kobe, Whoopi...

05:46.112 --> 05:48.376
- Whoopi? What did she do?
- It's not out yet,

05:48.448 --> 05:52.179
but apparently, it's shocking.
The Meades are next.

05:52.251 --> 05:55.277
- He wants to destroy your family.
- A little late for that.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.846
Not for you! Open up.

05:59.158 --> 06:04.653
Daniel, if he finds out just
how out of control you've gotten,

06:04.731 --> 06:07.791
you're gonna be
the first five chapters of that book.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.495
- Won't be my first time.
- Things are different.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.061
You've earned
some respect in this business.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.267
- Betty, you worry too much.
- Well, somebody has to worry!

06:16.342 --> 06:17.502
You are never here.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.171
I'm sure Alexis
is handling everything just fine.

06:20.246 --> 06:23.409
So that's it. You're just
gonna hand everything over to her.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.883
You've worked so hard
for the last six months.

06:25.952 --> 06:30.286
Yeah, and it was taken away from me
in a minute. Don't you get it?

06:30.356 --> 06:35.885
I'm being exactly the way my family
expects me to be. You know what?

06:35.962 --> 06:37.327
I'm having a blast.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.357
I'm actually good at this.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.760
Those aren't my shoes.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.168
You have models coming in at 4:00.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.265
Nice. Girl models, though, right?

06:50.343 --> 06:51.605
I'll be there.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.506
- Is that a problem, Dick?
- It's Nick.

06:56.582 --> 07:00.348
When I give a message to Alexis,
the person needs a last name. Get it?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.354
And what if Madonna calls?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.220
Ciccone, Penn, Ritchie, pick one.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.888
Snap! She read you.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.953
Why didn't anyone tell me
Alexis needed an assistant?

07:12.031 --> 07:15.194
I left Daniel's because
I thought I had a shot at moving up.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.236
- You got a new headset.
- I'm talking!

07:17.303 --> 07:19.703
I want a career I can be proud of,

07:19.772 --> 07:22.434
and a door I can close
when I want to take a nap.

07:22.508 --> 07:23.736
It's not too late.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.973
Hasn't been here long enough
for us to figure why we hate him.

07:27.046 --> 07:30.948
I know why: Because he's a suck-up.
And he won't sleep with me.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.450
[Scoffs] Me neither.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.084
Mandy, if you want Alexis
to see you as a contender,

07:36.155 --> 07:38.783
<i>be here 24l7,
and be willing to do ridiculous</i>

07:38.858 --> 07:41.952
and demoralizing things
for somebody who's too lazy to...

07:42.028 --> 07:45.691
Hello, Willy! Lick that for you?

07:49.068 --> 07:52.265
[Wilhelmina] Quincy Combs? How did
that snake get in here?

07:52.338 --> 07:54.203
There was a gag order against him.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.470
There should be. A red hat
with his skin tone? I'm gagging.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.135
Alexis is meeting with him.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.742
Let's put it this way:

08:02.815 --> 08:07.081
If my father were drowning,
I would pull up a lawn chair and watch.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.145
- My, such candor.
- Why not?

08:10.223 --> 08:14.057
You're writing a trashy book
and I'm dying to trash him.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.458
My father told me I was dead to him.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.997
He tormented my mother
by flaunting his affair.

08:19.065 --> 08:22.762
Flaunted? Fey's diaries
made it sound so discreet.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.770
Diaries? Who gave you her diaries?

08:25.838 --> 08:28.636
Fey's maid and I go back a long way.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.938
Is there anything
about my mother in them?

08:31.010 --> 08:34.001
Oh, yes.
When Fey writes about your mother,

08:34.080 --> 08:38.073
her pen drips with more venom than
a cobra squaring off with a mongoose.

08:38.150 --> 08:41.347
- Just get to the point.
- She thought she was a bitch.

08:41.419 --> 08:45.857
I have been meeting with my mother's
lawyers, trying to build a defense.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.722
If there's anything that could...

08:47.793 --> 08:50.853
Nothing I've read could
spring your mama from the big house.

08:50.930 --> 08:55.492
However, the diaries for the last six
months of her life are unaccounted for.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.059
- Might be something in there.
- Then I need them.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.697
Unfortunately,
nobody knows where they are.

09:00.773 --> 09:04.971
I suspect they may be locked up
in Fey's secret room.

09:05.044 --> 09:10.414
- What are you talking about?
- Your father and Ms. Sommers

09:10.483 --> 09:15.614
<i>had daily trysts right here
in the Mode office.</i>

09:15.688 --> 09:21.024
Fey refers to it
as their "love dungeon."

09:26.566 --> 09:28.397
[Models giggle]

09:34.106 --> 09:36.267
Can I get you girls some coffee?

09:36.676 --> 09:41.943
Ahem. Sorry for the interruption,
but you have a circulation meeting.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.209
Something wrong with your circulation?

09:45.017 --> 09:47.042
Do you need me to rub something?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.119
My sister can cover for me.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.549
Thanks.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.289
My sister covers for me all the time.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.896
- So you two do everything together?
- We have to.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.994
This is our first trip to New York,

10:05.071 --> 10:08.598
and I promised our mama
I would keep an eye on this one.

10:08.674 --> 10:12.474
Like I'm going to rip off
my clothes and jump into a fountain.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.712
So you do have plans for tonight.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.715
That depends on you.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.678
You can't follow him around
with a stun gun, love.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.554
I'm supposed to sit
and watch a friend fall apart?

10:26.626 --> 10:29.686
He's not a friend. He is your boss.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.559
He's both. I mean...

10:31.631 --> 10:35.362
Don't cross that line. This building
is not the place to look for friends.

10:35.434 --> 10:38.164
You don't want to get in
with these people. Trust me.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.797
Everyone around here
has got a hidden agenda.

10:40.873 --> 10:45.139
Not Daniel. And he needs me right now.
He's acting out to punish his family.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.805
He hasn't changed
his socks since Tuesday.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.974
His socks? Next,
you'll be packing his lunch for him.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.041
Oh, Betty! You didn't?

10:53.119 --> 10:56.213
Well, he can't drink like that
on an empty stomach.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.518
Since Henry
got back with his girlfriend,

10:58.591 --> 11:01.025
you're obsessed
with taking care of Daniel.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.253
That's crazy.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.058
When was the last time you
had a Meade-free night?

11:05.131 --> 11:07.497
I just went on that date
with my orthodontist.

11:07.566 --> 11:10.592
And we spent the entire night
with Daniel's mother.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.833
- And last Friday?
- I had Marc over for dinner.

11:13.906 --> 11:19.105
I left and ran off
to the printer... with Daniel.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.703
Oh, my God. You're right!

11:23.182 --> 11:26.174
My whole life is Daniel. What do I do?

11:26.252 --> 11:30.018
You can start by leaving this
building at a decent hour.

11:30.089 --> 11:31.852
Up for a bit of fun in the city?

11:31.924 --> 11:35.451
Yes. Yes! Right now!

11:35.528 --> 11:38.588
Promise you won't think
about this place the whole night.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.655
I promise. No Daniel.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.201
OK, am I dressed right for the club?

11:43.269 --> 11:45.999
Sure, if you're auditing them.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.408
[Music plays]

12:08.427 --> 12:09.587
Ta-da!

12:28.514 --> 12:31.847
Oh, look,
Scary Bradshaw and a side of potatoes.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.182
Guess what, Amanda?
Betty wears the same size shoe as you.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.356
- Becks!

26:59.150 --> 27:01.482
Anyway, I am here
as long as you need me.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.954
I don't. Thanks. Good night.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.654
Can I ask you a question?

27:09.894 --> 27:13.159
Did you even think of hiring me
to be your assistant?

27:13.231 --> 27:15.756
I wouldn't mind getting a leg up
in this company.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.928
Yes, but apparently you've
had both legs up with my brother.

27:19.004 --> 27:22.940
- That's ancient history.
- I just don't see us as a good fit.

27:24.542 --> 27:28.239
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
But I could've been a real asset to you.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.373
I know this place inside and out.
I know who stole what.

27:31.449 --> 27:35.715
I know who slept with who. I knew Janie
in Styles was pregnant before she did.

27:35.787 --> 27:39.655
And FYI, it's not her husband's
or her boyfriend's.

27:39.724 --> 27:41.624
You do know a lot.

27:41.693 --> 27:44.355
I'm trying to find something
to help my mother.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.863
Have you heard anything
about a secret room?

27:46.931 --> 27:50.128
- You mean the "love dungeon"?
- Do you know where it is?

27:50.201 --> 27:52.431
Sure. In Never-Never Land.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.337
It doesn't exist.
It was Fey's way of saying,

27:55.407 --> 27:57.204
"I'm hung over and want to go home."

27:57.275 --> 28:00.039
If you'd have hired me,
you'd already know that.

28:00.111 --> 28:03.808
Maybe I made a mistake. If anything
should ever happen to Nick,

28:03.882 --> 28:07.784
- you're next in line.
- Like, if he falls down the stairs?

28:07.852 --> 28:11.720
Actually, I was thinking more like,
if he got married and moved away,

28:11.790 --> 28:15.248
but I like your ambition. Forget
you ever saw me in Daniel's office.

28:15.326 --> 28:18.318
Pick out something nice
for yourself in the Closet.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.587
[Music plays]

28:25.036 --> 28:26.526
[Betty] Daniel!

28:30.375 --> 28:31.865
Daniel!

28:39.984 --> 28:41.383
Daniel!

28:49.761 --> 28:51.058
Daniel!

28:53.665 --> 28:56.828
Back away.
Daniel, this is Betty.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.960
If you hear me,
Quincy is in the house.

29:00.305 --> 29:04.105
Save yourself! Go out the back door!
Quincy Combs is looking...

29:07.779 --> 29:09.406
...for you.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.150
Is that girl stalking you?

29:21.793 --> 29:24.853
Sorry. My daughter says
the whole basement is flooded.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.193
- It must be a broken pipe.
- But I made dinner!

29:27.265 --> 29:28.823
Great. You could wrap it up,

29:28.900 --> 29:32.233
and we could do this later in the week.
Pork lasts forever.

29:33.772 --> 29:38.072
<i>- Ay, Dios. Could you open this, please?
- I don't like leftovers.</i>

29:38.143 --> 29:39.667
[Cell phone rings]

29:39.744 --> 29:42.474
I don't like to be interrupted
on my wedding night!

29:43.782 --> 29:47.274
Please, give me my phone back
and let me go. My family needs me.

29:47.352 --> 29:48.410
So do I.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.079
Now, try this on.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.488
- What, did you follow me here?
- No. Daniel, I was here before you.

30:00.565 --> 30:03.625
- Enjoying the "Filthy Cub Scout."
- What were you thinking?

30:03.701 --> 30:08.400
I didn't know what to do. I saw you
acting crazy and I saw Quincy's hat.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.169
No! We are not doing this here. I... No.

30:11.242 --> 30:13.802
- But Daniel, I was just trying to...
- Betty, stop!

30:15.013 --> 30:19.473
We're not at the office. I don't need a
chaperon or a bodyguard or a babysitter.

30:19.551 --> 30:24.352
When we leave that building,
your day is over. Do you understand?

30:24.422 --> 30:28.654
Please, for God's sake,
just let me live my life. Punch out!

30:29.460 --> 30:34.921
Daniel, you promised me and my sister
you'd come dance. Come on.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.815
You still here?

30:55.053 --> 30:58.386
- Thought I was burning midnight oil.
- What's that?

30:58.456 --> 31:02.392
I forgot to include it
with the earlier package.

31:04.095 --> 31:06.996
Mind if I sit for a moment?

31:07.866 --> 31:12.530
It's been a crazy day,
and my shoes are killing me.

31:17.475 --> 31:20.376
I know you never expect
to hear this from me,

31:20.445 --> 31:23.903
but sometimes it's criminal
what we do for fashion.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.412
Any chance we can have a drink,
Bradford?

31:28.486 --> 31:30.681
- What?
- Drink?

31:30.755 --> 31:33.690
Oh, yeah... What would you like?

31:33.758 --> 31:35.851
I'll have whatever you're having.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.011
[Alexis] I don't like being played.

31:57.081 --> 32:00.141
You gave me hope I could find
some evidence to help my mother.

32:00.218 --> 32:04.678
There is no "love dungeon," Quincy.
And no diaries either, I'm guessing.

32:04.756 --> 32:08.192
Go find some other chump,
because you just lost your best source.

32:08.259 --> 32:12.127
So the besieged queen needs
to see a little evidence.

32:12.196 --> 32:15.393
Well, I have it, right here.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.957
"September 9th, 2005.

32:18.036 --> 32:21.597
Don't know what I can say to comfort B.
We met in the love dungeon."

32:21.673 --> 32:24.233
See, right here,
Fey's handwriting. It goes on.

32:24.309 --> 32:27.801
"Our afternoon delight has been replaced
by talk, talk, talk of Alex

32:27.879 --> 32:30.939
and how badly B feels
for the way he treated his son."

32:31.015 --> 32:34.109
- This part is not important...
- Give me that.

32:34.185 --> 32:36.847
"Alex took off for Europe,

Try the pants on too.
I want to take a picture.

32:46.130 --> 32:49.293
- Constance, don't.
- You mind wearing a little heel?

32:49.367 --> 32:51.995
Don't want to tower over you.
I'm wearing my hair up.

32:52.070 --> 32:56.803
- We are not getting married!
- I am trying to help you, Nacho!

32:56.874 --> 33:00.435
You can't help me!
You don't even work there anymore!

33:00.511 --> 33:04.242
The game is over, Constance.
Now, please, let me go.

So you're gonna be
like all the rest of them, huh?

I hold your hand when you walk
into that big, scary courthouse.

I get you to the finish line
and then I never hear from you again.

33:17.562 --> 33:20.497
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

There are over 200 people in that book
alone. Where are they now?

Constance, every one
of those people remembers you

33:33.478 --> 33:35.446
and are grateful, believe me.

33:35.513 --> 33:39.472
Can't expect them to come back 'cause
they need you to hold their hands.

They have to go forward.
And so do you.

- Here.
- What is this for?

34:28.498 --> 34:30.728

before we leave.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.187
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have made you come here.

34:52.255 --> 34:55.350
No, you were right.
I get too involved.

Why can't I be more like you

- and stay out of the drama?
- Betty!

35:10.007 --> 35:13.101
No one can praise you
without you getting all weird.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.236
Because I don't deserve any of it.

35:18.282 --> 35:22.048
I didn't get into Fashion Week
because of my talent.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.147
- I made a deal with Wilhelmina.
- A deal?

35:26.224 --> 35:28.590
I agreed to do things for her.

35:28.659 --> 35:32.117
Certain favors, supplying information.

35:32.196 --> 35:35.131
- What kind of information?
- Oh, everything!

35:35.199 --> 35:38.464
Gossip, who's loyal, who's not.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.060
I think I had something to do

35:40.138 --> 35:44.006
with putting Daniel's
father and mother behind bars.

35:48.546 --> 35:53.415
Wait, why would you
ever agree to help Wilhelmina?

35:53.484 --> 35:57.011
Because I just wanted someone
to see my designs

35:57.088 --> 35:59.022
that wasn't my mother or my cat.

everything I've told you,

36:01.626 --> 36:03.093
you've taken and reported?

If someone came to you
and offered you help,

36:05.630 --> 36:09.589
- to get closer to your dream, you'd...
- No, I wouldn't.

36:09.667 --> 36:13.330
I have dreams too, but I would never
do something to hurt you like this.

36:13.404 --> 36:17.135
I didn't do this to hurt you. Can we
just please... Can we talk about it?

36:17.208 --> 36:19.699
No, I don't think that we can.

36:21.279 --> 36:27.081
Christina, you're right. That building
is the wrong place to look for friends.

I need to go to the bathroom.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.692
Hey.

38:23.768 --> 38:28.398
You weren't sleeping, were you?
I didn't think so.

38:31.842 --> 38:34.208
Where's... where's Becks?

38:34.278 --> 38:38.374
I thought it would be more fun
to end the night here.

38:41.652 --> 38:45.486
OK. There's still some more champagne.

38:45.556 --> 38:47.148
I've had plenty.

38:47.224 --> 38:50.785
So are you giving Petra
the May cover or the June?

38:50.861 --> 38:54.490

- I would prefer May.

- No.

I'm her mother.

so either you give her this cover,

39:10.348 --> 39:13.681

in a bit of trouble, Mr. Meade.

What does this mean?
You have to start over again?

The guy who's got my case
is gonna do what he can

39:39.043 --> 39:43.309
to get me the earliest possible
court date. We'll see.

She's just been lying
to you this whole time.

I think she's been punished enough.
So how was your night?

39:51.622 --> 39:54.455
Did you go to that big, fancy club?
Was it fun?

39:56.660 --> 39:57.888
That much, huh?

39:59.096 --> 40:03.999
- It's just been a very long day.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

You know, Dad,
people can really surprise you.

40:07.271 --> 40:10.866
Yes, they can. But it's not always bad.

40:10.941 --> 40:13.603

you're going to Yankee Stadium
