WEBVTT

00:14.348 --> 00:15.649
You see Videodrome yet?

00:15.649 --> 00:18.386
It's all this big
trenchant warning about

00:18.386 --> 00:20.121
addiction to television.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.022
Hey, we don't need
a warning, we're here.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.325
Dystopia is here, Ben.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.627
But you should check out
the earlier stuff,

00:26.627 --> 00:28.096
like the body horror
of Shivers,

00:28.096 --> 00:30.164
'cause they're infected
with this parasite

00:30.164 --> 00:32.366
that makes them
hyper-erotic.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.667
But they don't want to
say anything about it

00:33.667 --> 00:36.003
to each other, because
they're too polite.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.405
You know what I mean?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.740
Now that's a movie that
is profoundly Canadian.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.443
What, can I help you?

00:42.443 --> 00:44.145
Uh, I'm looking for
someone named Travis.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.847
You're not serving
a subpoena, are you?

00:46.847 --> 00:48.149
No.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.184
Oh, then you got him.
I'm Travis.

00:50.184 --> 00:53.821
Oh, I'm David Myers.
A guy I know named Barry
said I should look you up.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.723
Barry?

00:55.723 --> 00:56.957
Barry, no.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.359
I don't know
any Barrys, sorry.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.828
He's a photographer.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.663
Mustache.
Drives an El Camino.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.632
You just described
the Boston Strangler.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.434
Oh, okay.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.835
Well, I'm sorry
to bother you.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.338
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm just messing
with you, kid.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.972
Barry told me
you'd be coming by.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.441
- Yeah? Awesome.
- Yeah.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.442
So I understand you'd
like to log some time

01:14.442 --> 01:15.643
on an editing deck.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.145
I can't pay much,
but yeah.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.146
I wouldn't
worry about it.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.280
So here we go.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.482
We make six programs a week.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.717
Local call-in shows,
infomercials,

01:23.717 --> 01:25.386
ads for 1-900 sex lines.

01:25.386 --> 01:28.156
Our viewers are
shut-ins, insomniacs,

01:28.156 --> 01:30.724
stoner kids, people
contemplating suicide.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.727
guys who
are too ashamed to rent porn.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.628
Cool.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.797
So, how do you know
my man Barry?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.266
It's a long story.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.334
Really? Well, Cliff Notes
it for me.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.736
He's marrying
my ex-girlfriend.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.174
- Navajo brothers.
- Huh?

01:46.174 --> 01:48.008
You know, shelter in
the same wigwam.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.043
Never thought of
it that way.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.812
All right, here we go.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.448
Welcome to
the Thunderdome.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.060
What's that smell?

02:07.060 --> 02:09.197
Uh, someone's dreams dying.

02:09.197 --> 02:12.099
Or a decomposing mess.
We're overrun.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.100
Oh.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.668
Anyway, have fun.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.337
If you need me,
I'll be in my office

02:16.337 --> 02:18.439
lamenting my life choices.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.775
Or maybe jerking off,
so knock.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.881
I had such a nice time.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.116
Me, too.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.752
I mean, the Chinese food
was really spicy.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.521
I know.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.889
Should we get, like,
a coffee or something?

02:35.889 --> 02:38.025
Oh, um, thanks.

02:38.025 --> 02:41.595
I have to get up early to
show a house in the morning.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.897
Totally fine.
Maybe next time?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.766
Yeah, that would
be nice.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.001
This is me.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.103
Oh, um, well...

02:50.103 --> 02:52.473
I'm over there.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.817
Well, good night.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.353
Night.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.042
Heh!

03:29.042 --> 03:30.110
Oh my God.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.345
What am I looking at?

03:31.345 --> 03:33.414
It's a bris, you know,
the Jewish ritual.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.583
Oh, yeah. Kinky.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.285
I guess.

03:37.285 --> 03:40.888
Yeah. People have no idea
what kind of freaky shit
goes down in the burbs.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.423
But I know.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.158
I worked at Fotomat.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.595
Well, go on, show me more.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.797
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I like it.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.299
I like how you cut
from the baby

03:51.299 --> 03:53.166
to grandpa crying
like a little bitch.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.968
And then nervous dad
to Xanax'd mom.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.305
Then back to the wide shot,
establish the scene.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.739
Tells a story.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.008
Yeah, that's
pretty good stuff.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.176
Thanks.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.712
Oh, shit,
is that the time?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.714
No, that's a little fast.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.682
I need to go teach
a tennis lesson.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.418
Any chance I can come back?

04:10.418 --> 04:11.952
You know, another
time to finish?

04:11.952 --> 04:13.387
I'll tell you what.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.155
I can give you a few hours
in here whenever you need,

04:15.155 --> 04:16.890
if you'll log these old
tapes for me.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.592
Deal?

04:18.592 --> 04:21.094
- Deal!
- All right.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.230
Mackerel and...

04:23.230 --> 04:26.166
Super supper.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.369
Chicken and liver and kidney?

04:28.369 --> 04:31.839
Looks good.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.074
Liver, egg and bacon?

04:34.074 --> 04:36.009
Whoa!

04:45.218 --> 04:46.820
What kind?

04:46.820 --> 04:47.955
Sorry?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.189
What kind of cat?

04:49.189 --> 04:52.560
You know, whatever
the cat equivalent of
a mutt is.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.197
She's yea big, claws.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.032
Likes milk.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.770
My name's Sam,
by the way.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.937
Agatha.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.906
Agatha, wow.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.241
There's a name you
don't here too often.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.276
I hate it.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.644
No, you shouldn't.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.381
No, it's just, you know...
today, it's...

05:13.381 --> 05:15.649
It's an unusual name.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.017
You come in here a lot.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.420
Yeah, I live across the way
over at Moss Acres.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.455
Me, too. $15.80.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.492
Really?
I'm 1230.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.959
No, 15 dollars and 80 cents.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.431
I'm sorry.

05:32.533 --> 05:36.069
Listen, I'm having a little
4th of July party.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.138
You know, a few friends,

05:38.138 --> 05:40.007
gonna crack open
a few beers.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.411
Eat some of these dips,
maybe light a sparkler or two.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.414
You're more than welcome
to come over, you know,
when you get off work.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.149
You got a job?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.451
Yeah, I work for the IRS.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.520
I used to have
my own accounting firm,

05:52.520 --> 05:54.054
but then H&R Block came in...

05:54.054 --> 05:55.155
Kids?

05:55.155 --> 05:57.825
Yes, one.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.528
He's grown. Ish.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.095
He lives with me
part of the time.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.096
You're divorced?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.432
Almost.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.701
I have plans.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.540
Oh.

06:12.540 --> 06:16.444
Well, maybe some
other time.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.720
Pull it over, over.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.702
Boychik, can I
ask you a question?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.036
Sure.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.238
Are you happy
with your penis?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.774
Excuse me?

06:46.774 --> 06:50.210
You know, its sensitivity.
Relative ease of cleaning.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.311
On a scale of 1 to 10.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.680
Why are you asking?

06:52.680 --> 06:55.215
I'm considering converting
to Judaism.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.485
Things are going that
well with Widow Horowitz?

06:57.485 --> 06:59.219
They are.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.721
I suppose my biggest fear

07:00.721 --> 07:02.155
about entering the covenant
of circumcision

07:02.155 --> 07:06.193
is I simply won't recognize
the little Sultan anymore.

07:06.193 --> 07:09.029
We've been through many
a sordid adventure together.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.031
Yeah, it won't look
that different.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.500
Let me see yours.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.334
- No.
- 10 seconds, that's
all I ask.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.636
Forget it.
No, no, no, no.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.606
David, as your employer,
it is within my rights

07:18.606 --> 07:20.508
to insist you show me
your genitals.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.509
I'm leaving now.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.510
Please, please.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.244
I'm begging you.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.015
You know, most friends
just ask for help moving.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.685
I can do that too if
you need help moving.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.955
Oh, dear Lord.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.257
Your pubes!

07:37.257 --> 07:40.193
They're so thick and lush!

07:40.193 --> 07:42.530
It's like Lincoln's beard.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.097
Magnificent.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.699
Nassar?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.068
Skip.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.073
Just give me
the right answers

07:53.073 --> 07:55.008
to the questions
with the most points.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.544
Come on, man.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.580
Forget about scores
for a minute.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.815
A goal is not
always meant to be reached.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.151
It often serves simply
as something to aim at.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.086
Anyone, anyone know
who said that?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.120
Yes, Tabitha.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.188
Jesus?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.557
Close. Good guess.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.925
It was actually Bruce Lee.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.294
What does that have
to do with the SATs?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.765
Bruce Lee's goal wasn't
punching some dude in the face.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.099
That's just what he was
aiming at so he could get

08:19.099 --> 08:21.802
to something deeper,
the truth.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.136
Yo, fuck the truth, man!

08:23.136 --> 08:24.705
I'm just trying
to get into Rutgers.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.607
Yeah, if I don't raise
my SAT scores,

08:26.607 --> 08:28.742
my dad's gonna go
Bruce Lee on my ass.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.644
Come on, guys, I'm just
trying to leave you with

08:30.644 --> 08:32.680
something to think about
the day after the SATs.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.783
Because tests are just
about right answers.

08:35.783 --> 08:39.219
Life is about asking
the right questions.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.589
Wow.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.194
Agh!

08:47.194 --> 08:49.196
- Out.
- All right. That's enough.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.698
That's game.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.332
How's uh...

08:52.332 --> 08:54.101
How's my baby daughter?

08:54.101 --> 08:54.902
Seen her much lately?

08:54.902 --> 08:56.937
Not as much as I'd like.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.606
She's always working, and when
she isn't, she's painting.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.108
She making good tips?

09:01.108 --> 09:02.075
Yeah, decent.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.144
Decent, what do
you call decent?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.614
I don't think she'd like
me discussing that with you.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.748
Come on.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.282
Throw me a bone here.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.453
Some nights she can make
60 or 70 bucks cash.

09:13.453 --> 09:14.454
Oh...

09:14.454 --> 09:15.923
Do me a favor.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.125
Just get this to her, please?

09:18.125 --> 09:18.926
Give her this.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.060
No, she won't take it.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.729
Don't tell her
it's from me.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.296
Then she'll think it's
from me, which is weird.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.065
Buy her groceries, or something.
I don't know, be creative.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.867
I don't think
it's a good idea.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.036
Can you at least
give her a message?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.470
Yeah, okay.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.906
Could you tell her
we would appreciate
a call once in a while?

09:32.906 --> 09:35.976
We've heard from her maybe
one time in the last two weeks.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.878
Just so her mother
doesn't worry.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.247
All right, and you and I,
we're on for lunch Wednesday.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.849
Yeah, sure.

09:41.849 --> 09:45.753
Not that Indian shit again,
my stomach's still killing me.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.287
You do know what's
going on here, right?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.822
What?

09:48.822 --> 09:51.358
You're being groomed,
like a Westminster Shih Tzu.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.660
Groomed for what?

09:52.660 --> 09:53.661
Son-in-law.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.095
No, I'm not.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.097
Why else do you think
he would take you

09:57.097 --> 09:58.699
on all these lunches
and introduce you
around the office?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.668
Because I'm his only
link to Skye.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.205
How did your generation get
so cynical, I'll never know.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.875
You're wrong.
Fortune has smiled
upon the both of us.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.611
I plan to recommend you
for the job of head pro
when I retire.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.881
But it appears that,
like me,

10:13.881 --> 10:17.217
you, too, are destined
for something greater.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.759
Oh, Misty!

10:25.759 --> 10:27.394
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.461
I'm Tabitha.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.730
One of Wheeler's students.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.731
Right, hi.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.832
Can I ask you something?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.266
Yeah, what's up?

10:33.266 --> 10:35.703
I've seen you and Wheeler
hanging out and stuff,

10:35.703 --> 10:37.437
and I was just
wondering, well,

10:37.437 --> 10:39.673
if you're together.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.208
Oh.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.342
Uh...

10:42.342 --> 10:44.444
Not that it's any
of my business.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.014
Um, you know,

10:47.014 --> 10:48.248
uh...

10:48.248 --> 10:50.751
We're just friends.
Yeah.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.519
Cool.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.553
Why?

10:53.553 --> 10:56.456
I was just curious.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.791
Bye.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.731
What? Tell me.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.133
I've got good news, they
came back with a plea deal.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.367
A plea deal?

11:07.367 --> 11:08.902
Fuck that, no.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.603
I'm... I'm not
copping a plea.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.073
Doug, listen to me, you can't
afford this going to trial.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.908
And if you get convicted,

11:14.908 --> 11:17.610
all those guys on
your trading floor
will be out on the street.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.748
Oh, please, spare me
the guilt trip, all right?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.349
There's not one of those
guys that wouldn't

11:22.349 --> 11:24.084
throw me under a bus,
given half a chance.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.553
Well, you realize that
the state's attorney

11:26.553 --> 11:28.421
can freeze your assets?

11:28.421 --> 11:29.522
Can't do that.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.523
Technically he can.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.925
Can he?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.927
Yep, felonies like
securities and mail fraud

11:33.927 --> 11:36.196
can be defined
as racketeering.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.330
Racketeering?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.933
That's usually only
done in cases of

11:39.933 --> 11:41.168
narcotics and
organized crime.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.602
Yeah.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.071
But it's Giuliani, he's got
political ambitions.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.973
He's out collecting scalps.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.641
And he'd like nothing
more than to add yours
to his collection.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.811
What is he offering?

11:50.811 --> 11:53.781
Six months house arrest
with an ankle monitor.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.884
- Okay.
- Two years probation.

11:56.884 --> 12:00.220
And a lifetime ban
on securities trading.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.390
Fuck.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.259
Think it over.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.161
Discuss it with Fay.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.930
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And call me.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.803
Nice curving, though.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.437
Oh, I'm so rusty.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.074
Oh, please, it's good when
the ball goes over the fence

12:21.074 --> 12:23.043
every once in a while, it
shows power in your backhand.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.644
You're just being nice.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.980
Well, I am a little biased.

12:26.980 --> 12:31.184
So are you perchance watching
the fireworks with anybody
this evening?

12:31.184 --> 12:34.087
Uh, as a matter
of fact, I'm not.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.222
Hmm.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.590
Uh, shall we say
the fairway at dusk?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.826
I'll bring the bubbly?

12:38.826 --> 12:40.360
That sounds lovely.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.562
All right, who didn't
get ice cream?

12:42.562 --> 12:44.397
Here you go, before it melts.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.399
Make sure your dad
votes for me.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.635
- You got it.
- All right,
step on up, everybody.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.470
It's one me, enjoy.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.072
Counting on your vote.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.974
Lenny, I don't have to
worry about you, right?

12:53.974 --> 12:54.975
I'm on the fence.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.609
Well, we'll talk.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.180
All right, before it melts,
everybody get your ice cream.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.349
Okay.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.851
See you, sweetie.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.452
So?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.386
What'd the lawyer want?

13:06.386 --> 13:08.388
Oh, nothing,
just, you know,

13:08.388 --> 13:10.723
bringing me up to date
on the case.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.992
And, any news?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.493
Not really.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.166
Well, there was, um...

13:19.166 --> 13:20.300
What?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.169
States attorney is
offering a plea deal.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.472
Six months of house arrest
with the ankle thingy,

13:25.472 --> 13:28.408
and after that it'd be
two years of probation.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.178
That's incredible!
My God, that's nothing!

13:31.178 --> 13:32.612
That's a slap on the wrist.

13:32.612 --> 13:33.981
And there's more.

13:33.981 --> 13:38.051
I'd be banned from
trading for life.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.621
Oh.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.656
Oh, Dougy.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.293
Yeah.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.632
Take it.

13:52.632 --> 13:53.934
What do you mean, take it?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.668
What are we supposed
to do for money?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.137
We'll think of
other things to do.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.639
Listen, we got savings,

13:59.639 --> 14:01.909
and the most important thing

14:01.909 --> 14:03.643
is keeping you
out of jail.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.646
And our family
out of the papers.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.548
Yeah?

14:08.548 --> 14:09.782
Yeah.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.817
Call.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.152
I got trips.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.753
- Oh my God.
- Unbelievable.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.488
You're unbelievable.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.824
You fellas must be
gluttons for punishment.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.293
Laugh it up, Ricky.
You know we work for the IRS.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.529
Yeah, we're going to get
8% of that back.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.565
Come on, Gracie,
get out of here.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.300
Get out of here.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.070
Hey, Sam, man, I'm sorry
about my cousin Janice
standing you up.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.338
Oh, no, that's water
under the bridge.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.606
You know, my wife thinks
you dodged a bullet.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.942
Yeah, says she's a gold digger.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.576
She can dig however
much she wants.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.445
Only gold she's going to
find here is in my fillings.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.382
Besides, I want Ricky
here to take me to one
of his singles bars.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.417
I don't think you'd like
the places I hang out, Sam.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.618
Why, too smoky?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.588
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.323
I don't think I'm much
for the single's scene, anyway.

14:50.323 --> 14:54.327
Fellas, I think that
the love boat has sailed
without me.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.096
Come on, you can't
say that, Sam.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.330
No, it's true.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.999
This morning, I meet
this woman, okay?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.700
When she finds out
that I was divorced,

15:00.700 --> 15:03.971
she looks at me
like I have a goiter.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.072
You ask me,
you're better off.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.839
Don't listen to Ricky.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.108
There's a lid for every pot.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.476
You just got
to keep looking, Sam.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.579
Well, I think I left
my lid in Korea.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.015
How's that, Sam?

15:15.015 --> 15:16.984
During the war,
there's this girl.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.518
Soon Hi.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.987
I say girl, but I mean,
you know,

15:19.987 --> 15:22.389
she's got to be
my age now.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.993
I think she was the only
woman who ever understood me.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.995
We didn't even
speak the same language.

15:27.995 --> 15:32.732
And I would help her with
her English, she would teach
me how to dance.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.568
The two of us really
cut a rug together.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.904
Anyway, who wants
some more beer, huh?

15:37.904 --> 15:38.905
Ricky? Glen?

15:38.905 --> 15:39.906
I'll take one.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.541
And try this bean dip.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.043
Come here, Gracie.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.312
Come on, sweetheart.
It's my ex's recipe.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.049
It's a six layer dip,
but I swear, I could
only remember five of them.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.524
Holy shit!

15:58.658 --> 16:01.128
Dude, what the fuck
are you wearing?

16:01.128 --> 16:02.695
Skye bought it,
it's some designer.

16:02.695 --> 16:03.763
Do you like it?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.332
No, it's hideous, honestly.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.034
Please, you have to
take this off.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.735
I can't be friends with
you with this outfit.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.403
What the hell do
you know about fashion?

16:10.403 --> 16:11.604
Very true.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.040
Skye's throwing a party with
some of her neighbors.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.907
I've got to go
get some ice.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.709
You tell her about all of
these power lunches you've
been having with her pops?

16:16.709 --> 16:18.711
No, she'd freak.
It's weird.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.048
It's like I'm cheating on
my girlfriend with her father.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.716
It's like The Graduate.
Except gay.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.421
Enjoy the fireworks.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.058
I'll take a tequila sunrise.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.559
Yep.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.094
I'm going to try
the Surfer Curl only
make mine a virgin.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.595
- Uh-huh.
- Mine, too.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.729
All right.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.265
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.567
Well, are you going
to keep me in suspense?

16:40.567 --> 16:41.634
About what?

16:41.634 --> 16:44.404
Um, how your date
with Margot went.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.075
Um, oh, well, uh,
it was nice.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.209
It was a nice time, yeah.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.778
You know, she's hysterical,
and...

16:51.778 --> 16:55.848
But she's also
easy to talk to

16:55.848 --> 16:59.852
and interesting and,
um, she held my hand
during the movie.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.154
Oh.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.756
So are you going
to see her again?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.358
I think so.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.428
I mean, she asked me
to come to her stand-up
show next week.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.863
So I guess that means
she wants to see me again.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.866
Oh, believe me, she wants
to see you again.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.902
Yeah.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.539
Pardon my tardiness.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.340
Oh!

17:20.340 --> 17:22.375
Not at all, not at all.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.976
There you are,
careful, careful.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.478
The tip is still
quite hot.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.348
Can I interest you in
a little bit of libation

17:28.348 --> 17:29.982
for our nation's independence?

17:33.953 --> 17:35.655
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.124
Are you chilly?

17:37.124 --> 17:38.391
A little.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.760
Let's take care
of that right now.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.563
Oh, you're so sweet.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.132
What is that?

17:45.132 --> 17:47.234
Oh, what, this? Oh.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.336
I don't understand,
you're not Jewish.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.472
No, but, um, I've spent
much of my career

17:52.472 --> 17:56.176
working amongst
Jewish people,

17:56.176 --> 17:58.378
and to be honest
since I've met you,

17:58.378 --> 18:00.713
I've taken a great
interest in the faith.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.049
Such a fascinating history,
so much suffering,

18:03.049 --> 18:05.585
and yet such a
love for life.

18:05.585 --> 18:10.157
Which, as I understand
it is what "l'chaim"
means in Hebrew.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.159
Oh.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.738
Hey!

18:25.738 --> 18:27.307
What are you doing out
here by yourself?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.041
Just doing some thinking.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.977
Yeah?

18:30.977 --> 18:32.245
Want some company?

18:32.245 --> 18:35.182
Sure, pull up
some rock.

18:38.285 --> 18:41.354
How are those, um,
algebra problems coming?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.390
Good, yeah.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.192
I really think they're
starting to get it.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.726
Well, good.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.362
You're really good at
that, you know?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.830
Like, the whole
teaching thing.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.565
I'm proud of you.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.367
Thanks.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.770
One of your students was
asking about you today.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.839
Oh, God.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.408
I think she's hot for teacher.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.609
Seriously, stop.
That's not funny.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.211
Oh, come on.
It's fine.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.512
She's cute.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.414
Doesn't matter,
she's my student.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.749
I'd never violate the sanctity
of that relationship.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.618
- All right.
- Even next month,
when I'm done

19:11.618 --> 19:13.420
tutoring her,
she'll still be underage.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.388
Nothing can change that.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.791
Except her birthday
at the end of August.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.396
Holy shit, you
like this girl.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.432
I don't know.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.150
Ah, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.652
Gracias.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.061
Think you should maybe
slow down a little, sweetie?

19:55.061 --> 19:57.264
It's a holiday.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.765
I'm celebrating.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.375
You know, I've been giving
this plea deal thing

20:08.375 --> 20:10.777
a lot of thought.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.046
And?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.749
I'm gonna turn it down.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.619
Fuck Giuliani,
fuck his witch hunt.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.655
I'll take my chances
with a jury.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.895
I always knew

20:28.895 --> 20:32.465
you were a stubborn man
when I married you.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.536
I just didn't know
you were stupid.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.348
Shut the fuck up.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.519
**

20:58.525 --> 21:00.092
Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.061
I'm really happy with how those
portraits turned out, too.

21:02.061 --> 21:05.732
I just feel like the faces
here are so much more inspiring.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.934
And the energy,
in the city?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.736
It's just amazing.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.203
Excuse me.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.972
Hi, you're here.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.106
Hey.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.475
Hi.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.109
Oh, Zan, Zan.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.845
Hi, you remember
my friend David.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.713
Cool shirt.

21:20.713 --> 21:21.781
Thanks.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.351
Zan just heard that
one of her shorts

21:24.351 --> 21:26.519
got accepted into
a gallery showing

21:26.519 --> 21:27.954
of emerging artists.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.357
Isn't that amazing?

21:30.357 --> 21:31.891
Congrats.

21:31.891 --> 21:35.662
Thanks. Feels good
to finally emerge.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.230
It was getting stuffy here
in obscurity.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.370
You ever try
looking for her?

21:43.370 --> 21:44.937
Who?

21:44.937 --> 21:46.939
Your Korean ladyfriend.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.375
Soon Hi?

21:48.375 --> 21:49.909
What, are you kidding?

21:49.909 --> 21:52.211
She lives halfway
across the world.

21:52.211 --> 21:56.383
Sam, buddy, we work for
the Internal Revenue Service.

21:56.383 --> 21:58.785
We're practically CIA.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.258
What am I eating?

22:06.258 --> 22:08.127
Falafel.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.462
Is it meat?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.964
It's chickpeas.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.535
God.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.969
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

22:16.969 --> 22:20.740
How come you never introduce
me as your boyfriend?

22:20.740 --> 22:23.510
I told you, I don't
have boyfriends.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.478
Well, not since
the sixth grade.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.113
Then what am I?

22:27.113 --> 22:30.417
You are the adorable person

22:30.417 --> 22:31.851
that I share my bed with.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.753
Yeah, I don't have a problem
calling you my girlfriend.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.623
Yeah, I know, and
I always hate it.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.591
- Really?
- Hate is too strong.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.793
But it makes me
uncomfortable.

22:40.793 --> 22:41.761
Why?

22:41.761 --> 22:44.296
Be-- because I don't
like labels.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.432
Are you sure
that's all it is?

22:45.432 --> 22:46.933
Of course.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.568
Why?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.503
I just wouldn't want it to be
that you're ashamed of me.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.204
Why would you think that?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.874
The other day when you
were telling Zan about
my bris video,

22:54.874 --> 22:57.143
you made it sound like it was
an art film or something.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.445
Like you were embarrassed.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.613
Or wanted me to seem
cooler than I am.

23:00.613 --> 23:04.216
I'm not embarrassed by you.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.452
I'm not.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.253
And I... I'm...

23:07.253 --> 23:10.890
Afraid of turning
what we have into
something conventional.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.528
Because it doesn't feel
that way to me.

23:15.528 --> 23:19.732
It feels special.

23:32.779 --> 23:37.750
* To want this *

23:37.750 --> 23:42.088
* Of everything we've made *

23:46.793 --> 23:49.161
* The times
it's worked before *

23:49.161 --> 23:51.864
Wow.

23:55.802 --> 23:59.005
* Of all the things
we've said *

23:59.005 --> 24:00.039
Ooh!

24:00.039 --> 24:02.942
- Now, that's pretty.
- Yeah.

24:04.744 --> 24:10.583
* Times that worked
before today *

24:26.699 --> 24:31.538
* To want this *

24:31.538 --> 24:36.208
* Of everything we made *

24:40.279 --> 24:46.118
* The times
it's worked before *

24:49.255 --> 24:53.960
* Of all the things
we've said *

24:58.164 --> 25:04.136
* They've always worked
before today *
