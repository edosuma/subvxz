my stomach pumped,

something pops up.

a little worried about Dave.

Oh, oh.
We're really doing this.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.452

when the music stops.

02:00.511 --> 02:03.079
I'll pass that along.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.429
The point is, he's trying
to grow up too fast.

He's not even
trick-or-treating tonight.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.347

give me my sour gummy worms?

Okay.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.369
I mean like a fun scare

02:32.456 --> 02:34.893

to me and my brother
when we were kids.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.156

And Dave loves it, too.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.031

into my arms,

a good snuggle.Aww.

it's too baby-ish.

was no costumes.

got the flu,

this story when he was a boy
