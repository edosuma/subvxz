00:01.599 --> 00:05.239
(Susan) Shag, shag, shag. Can't we play
a game that's not about sex?

00:05.239 --> 00:07.719
(Kurt) Like what?
(Susan) I don't know...

00:07.719 --> 00:11.039
- (Jenny) Top five Christmas films.
(Susan) Yes. Kurt.

00:11.039 --> 00:15.939
(Kurt) Erm... Number one, Great Escape.
(Jenny) Films about Christmas.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.680
Oh, right. Number one,
Where Eagles Dare.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.320
There's a lot of snow.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.439
It's A Wonderful Life.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.360
- What's that?
- It's the best Christmas film ever.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.398
Never heard of it.

00:31.399 --> 00:35.039
Number two, Godfather.
Brando gets shot on Christmas Eve.

00:35.039 --> 00:37.400
- Three...
- Let's play something else.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.518
The new English teacher.

00:39.519 --> 00:42.919
Fat, ugly lesbian
or thin, straight bloke with a beard?

00:42.919 --> 00:47.399
Sorry - are we guessing
what the new English teacher looks like?

00:47.960 --> 00:50.719
- No. Who would you rather have?
- You mean shag?

00:50.719 --> 00:53.960
No, I mean as a colleague.
Who would you rather work with -

00:53.960 --> 00:57.880
a fat, ugly lesbian
or a thin, straight bloke with a beard?

00:57.880 --> 01:00.880
- He hasn't got a beard.
- It's a bloke?

01:01.320 --> 01:04.358
- You've met him?
- Briefly. After his interview.

01:04.358 --> 01:07.158
- What's he like?
- He's not Simon...

01:07.159 --> 01:10.159
- which is good.
- Is it?

01:10.400 --> 01:12.158
Does he drink?

01:12.159 --> 01:15.640
I'm not sure if he filled in that box
on his application.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.160
- Does he smoke?
- Does he like girls?

01:18.160 --> 01:20.879
Ask him yourself.
He's coming in tomorrow.

01:20.879 --> 01:23.319
- What for?
- To take a look round the school.

01:23.319 --> 01:25.479
- Meet the staff.
- You're not leaving.

01:25.479 --> 01:31.120
No, I'm going to the bar for drinks but it's
cold up there so I thought I'd wrap up.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.120
- Pint of lager, please.
- Mmm!

01:39.040 --> 01:43.559
(Jenny) 41 hours, seven minutes
and 25 seconds till the end of term.

01:43.559 --> 01:46.559
And only 24 hours till I have sex.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.320
After the party,
I'll have sex with... someone.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.879
(Howling wind)

01:54.880 --> 01:57.199
Everyone has sex after the party.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.540
It's tradition. Like turkey and crackers
and The Great Escape.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.000
I've never had sex
after a Christmas party.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.239
Maybe you'll get lucky this year.

02:06.239 --> 02:10.120
The lucky people will be all the ones
who don't have sex with you,

02:10.120 --> 02:13.410
which includes me,
Jenny and, I imagine, Brian.

04:46.799 --> 04:49.519
Just to let you know
that Mr Casey's replacement

04:49.519 --> 04:51.880
is arriving at lunch time to look around.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.870
He's called Matthew Harvey.
Please make him feel welcome.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.759
It might be nice
if he came to the Christmas party.

05:07.719 --> 05:10.599
Thank you.

- Shit.
- What's wrong?

05:13.079 --> 05:17.200
This new bloke might get off with
the woman I'm supposed to have.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.839
- That would be...?
- Carol.

05:18.839 --> 05:21.119
- Fuck off.

They're giving us turkey
every day of the week

It's Matt, not Matthew.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.130
I was hoping someone would show Matt
around the school.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.360
- Perhaps Miss Neville could help out.
- Sorry?

06:11.360 --> 06:15.959
Since you'll be handing classes over
to Matt, you can show him the ropes.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.279
Can I get some lunch first?

06:18.280 --> 06:21.280
- It's turkey.

Brian is living proof

07:03.640 --> 07:06.000
I taught a bit of PE at my last school.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.010
- Coached a year 11 football team.
- Right.

07:10.959 --> 07:13.959
So... how were the English GCSE results?

07:14.080 --> 07:16.198
- When?
- Last year.

07:16.199 --> 07:19.279
- Wouldn't know.
- Didn't you have an Ofsted inspection?

07:19.279 --> 07:22.279
- Did we?
- Mm. How did it go?

07:22.519 --> 07:25.519
Don't ask me.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.640
Are you sure you actually teach here?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.158
- What are those?
- What?

07:37.159 --> 07:40.519
- Those. Earrings.
- You're asking what these earrings are?

07:40.519 --> 07:42.019
They're earrings.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.639
(Giggling)

07:44.640 --> 07:47.640
They're not allowed. Not in year 7.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.639
- Who says?
- It's a school rule.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.960
I've only just had my ears pierced.
I have to wear them.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.120
I've seen you with earrings before.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.120
Smaller ones but still rings in your ears.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.799
You'd have told me to take them out
if you'd seen them before.

08:02.799 --> 08:05.799
- I suppose so.
- Well, there you go.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.519
But I'm telling you
to take them out now.

08:08.519 --> 08:10.759
They'll go septic.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.239
- Will they?
- If that's what you want...

08:13.239 --> 08:17.019
- Hang on...
- I expect I'll have to take antibiotics.

08:19.239 --> 08:21.719
Don't take them out, then.
Put them back in.

08:21.719 --> 08:25.400
No, I'll do what you tell me.
But watch out for my mum.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.400
I'm not worried about your mum.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.919
Shouldn't you
be doing something, Errol?

08:43.479 --> 08:45.518
No.

08:45.519 --> 08:47.479
Liz, I need to speak to you.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.119

(Muttering) He's... just... going.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.679
- What?
- She said I'm just going.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.719
- And are you?
- Yeah.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.720
See you later, then.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.720
Apart from fetching a bucket in which
to be sick, what can we do for you?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.439
Actually, it was Liz I wanted a word with.

09:15.439 --> 09:17.559

09:17.560 --> 09:20.478
It'll keep. Sorry.

09:20.479 --> 09:22.999
Is there a point
in asking what that was about?

- Please don't bother.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.160
- Well, payment and reward.
- Right.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.560
Is "heritage" a reference
back to the rich dead?

09:51.599 --> 09:54.518
- Rich what?
- Dead.

09:54.519 --> 09:58.160

weren't literally rich.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.038
Some of them. Possibly.

10:01.039 --> 10:03.799
Is Brooke being metaphorical or literal?

10:03.799 --> 10:07.319
Maybe Brooke is saying something
about the dead becoming rich

10:07.319 --> 10:09.799
because of the way
they were allowed to die.

10:09.799 --> 10:12.119

10:12.119 --> 10:15.119
No. Feel free.

- Liz.
- Brian.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.280
- What do you want?
- I want you...

10:32.560 --> 10:35.560
Can we go somewhere more private?

I don't want you to hear this

10:43.679 --> 10:46.679
Still here, Mr Steadman?

10:47.239 --> 10:49.678
Er... just going.

10:49.679 --> 10:51.719
We need to talk.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.720
I think we better.

10:57.319 --> 10:59.679
(Jenny) How is this going
to be a party venue?

10:59.679 --> 11:01.720
- Give it time.
- I could give it a year.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.200
It'd still look like a school hall with tinsel.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.119

11:07.119 --> 11:09.160

- He loves Christmas.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.320

- (JP) Grab this ladder.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.540
I haven't seen him this excited

11:18.559 --> 11:20.798
- Anyone?
- Who wants a bevvy?

11:20.799 --> 11:25.909
Good idea. Sooner we get pissed, sooner
we can start shagging... someone.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.679
I can't wait to see who it's going to be.

11:28.679 --> 11:32.239

11:32.239 --> 11:35.679
- I'll take photos if you like.
- A very good idea.

11:35.679 --> 11:40.019
Women love being photographed

11:40.359 --> 11:44.639
- There will be someone.
- Not if Matt gets off with whoever she is.

11:44.639 --> 11:48.000
- The woman who doesn't exist.
- Why would she want Matt?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.120
- (Jenny) So many reasons.
- He's not good-looking, is he?

11:51.120 --> 11:54.120
- Yes.
- Do you fancy him?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.038
- Do you?
- Even if I did,

11:57.039 --> 12:00.119
I wouldn't shag the new teacher
on his first day at school.

12:00.119 --> 12:03.119
- Why not?
- You'd shag a new teacher?

12:03.160 --> 12:05.239
- Yeah.
- Even though he's a bloke?

12:05.239 --> 12:08.119
(Brian) Kurt's not that fussy.
(Jenny) Maybe Matt is.

12:08.119 --> 12:11.679
- He looks like he's got standards.
- (Kurt) Matt wouldn't shag me?

12:11.679 --> 12:14.899
- (Susan) Do you want him to?
- Yes. Er... no.

12:15.199 --> 12:18.199

- Oh, yes.

- There you go, mate.
- Cheers.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.319
- Anyone fancy a drink?
- I'm OK.

12:44.319 --> 12:46.559
- I'll have the usual.
- What's that?

12:46.559 --> 12:48.379
- A pint of lager.
- Matt?

12:48.999 --> 12:52.119
No, if I start drinking now
I'll end up pissed.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.678
Yeah...

12:53.679 --> 12:56.760
I don't want to make a bad impression

27:19.599 --> 27:22.609
- You weren't very good.
- I tried my best.

27:23.599 --> 27:27.080
- That was your best? The first time...
- That was an accident.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.860
But after that couldn't you
try something interesting?

27:30.919 --> 27:33.639
- Like what?
- Like foreplay for a start!

27:33.639 --> 27:36.440
- There was foreplay!
- Groping me in the taxi?

27:36.440 --> 27:39.590
- And on the stairs!
- Will you keep it down?

27:39.759 --> 27:43.329
- I thought you'd gone.
- I can't make it in today.

27:43.640 --> 27:47.280
You didn't hear what
she just said... about the sex?

27:47.640 --> 27:49.959
Yeah.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.960
- Could you keep it to yourself?
- Yeah.

27:55.519 --> 27:58.519
And you won't tell anyone. Will you?

27:59.599 --> 28:01.839
As if I would.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.999
♪ You're a bum, you're a punk
♪ You're an old slut on junk

28:04.999 --> 28:07.960
♪ Lying there almost dead
on a drip in that bed

28:07.960 --> 28:11.000
♪ You scumbag, you maggot,
you cheap, lousy faggot

28:11.000 --> 28:14.719
♪ Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last... ♪

28:14.719 --> 28:17.399
Good morning! How are you?

28:17.400 --> 28:19.839
♪ Still singing Galway Bay

28:19.840 --> 28:23.410
♪ And the bells are ringing out
for Christmas Day ♪

28:25.160 --> 28:26.958
Good morning!

28:26.959 --> 28:31.019
Six hours, 27 minutes and 30 seconds
till the end of term.

28:33.319 --> 28:35.358
What?

28:35.359 --> 28:37.599
You don't fancy
doing that again, do you?

28:37.599 --> 28:40.479
- You said he wouldn't ask.
- Brian, behave yourself.

28:40.479 --> 28:43.839
What's wrong with asking?
Had a good time, didn't we?

28:43.839 --> 28:47.599
I'd have to be very desperate and drunk
to have sex with you again.

28:47.599 --> 28:49.678
So how about tonight, then?

28:49.679 --> 28:51.839
Here. Cover plans for the lightweights

28:51.839 --> 28:54.989
who couldn't drag
themselves in this morning.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.480
Morning, everyone.

28:59.439 --> 29:01.479
Mr Harvey. How are you today?

29:01.480 --> 29:04.480
Great, thanks. Morning, all.

29:04.559 --> 29:07.559
- What happened to you?
- Nothing. Why?

29:07.880 --> 29:10.879
- Didn't see you leave.
- I disguised myself

29:10.879 --> 29:14.379
as the Camp Commandant
and walked past the guards.

29:14.759 --> 29:18.189
- Did I miss anything?
- You didn't miss a thing.

29:19.199 --> 29:22.199
- How was your hotel?
- Fine.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.719
- Anyone seen Bob?
- Yes. Over there.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.870
- What's wrong with JP?
- A pretend migraine.

29:29.359 --> 29:32.359
I gave him aspirins,
told him to be here by dinner.

29:32.359 --> 29:34.398
When did you see JP?

29:34.399 --> 29:36.558
This morning at your place.

29:36.559 --> 29:39.779
I slept with Kurt last night.
He was terrible.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.480
- How was Brian?
- Not bad. You slept with Kurt?

29:44.440 --> 29:46.998
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

29:46.999 --> 29:49.999
But he's got a very small penis.

29:50.879 --> 29:53.600
Do you mean small
in proportion to the rest of him

29:53.600 --> 29:55.960
or small compared to the average size?

29:55.960 --> 29:58.960
I just mean small. Very small.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.080
Morning.

30:08.879 --> 30:11.479
- Are my flies open?
- No.

30:11.480 --> 30:16.240
We were looking at you because Liz
says you have a very small penis.

30:25.999 --> 30:28.119
(Bell)

30:28.120 --> 30:30.878
Don't push. Keep the noise down.

30:30.879 --> 30:33.879
That includes you, Kayla.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.520
I am sick and tired of your attitude.

30:38.640 --> 30:42.140
Your lack of respect.
It's got to stop, hasn't it?

30:43.080 --> 30:46.080
I said, hasn't it?

30:48.840 --> 30:51.840
Are you crying?

30:52.999 --> 30:54.678
Come on.

30:54.679 --> 30:57.899
- What have you done to her?
- I made her cry.

31:00.239 --> 31:02.759
I made her cry.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.559
- Result!
- It's terrible!

31:05.560 --> 31:08.850
- It's what you wanted.
- No. I thought it was.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.960
I feel like a... bully.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.600
- Did you find Errol?
- No.

31:20.719 --> 31:24.289
- What's wrong? Hangover?
- Too much Liebfraumilch.

31:26.879 --> 31:29.239
Did something happen
with Kurt last night?

31:29.239 --> 31:31.759
- What do you mean?
- He wouldn't shut up

31:31.759 --> 31:33.799
about you and your glasses.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.880
He kept on and on
about you taking them off.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.920
- When?
- Last night. After the party.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.040
I went back to his place.
We slept together.

31:45.160 --> 31:48.160
You don't have a problem with that?

31:48.919 --> 31:50.400
No.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.158
You're over Kurt, aren't you?

31:53.159 --> 31:55.480
Anyway, you're better off with someone

31:55.480 --> 31:59.120
whose willy you can actually see
with the naked eye.

32:00.079 --> 32:03.079
I take it you did have sex with Kurt?

32:08.440 --> 32:10.679
- So what do I do?
- Hide.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.680
- Hide.
- You can't hide from Liz.

32:14.680 --> 32:18.079
You can run but she'll hunt you down
and kill you like a dog.

32:18.079 --> 32:21.560
(Bob) ..to be marked by the end
of the week preceding half term,

32:21.560 --> 32:24.200
draft lesson plans every Friday afternoon

32:24.200 --> 32:27.760
incorporating my notes
by the following Monday, OK?

32:27.760 --> 32:29.799
- Fantastic.
- Excellent.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.679
I'm just going to pop home
and shag my wife.

32:32.679 --> 32:35.079
(Bob) See you next term.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.080
- Bye.
- (Susan) Hello.

32:38.839 --> 32:41.960
Have you heard about Brian?
He made a year 7 cry.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.999
- (Jenny) A girl.
- I was trying to keep it quiet!

32:44.999 --> 32:47.999
- What are we talking about?
- Nothing.

32:49.679 --> 32:51.919
Right. I'm off now.

32:51.920 --> 32:55.480
- You're not staying for lunch?
- Turkey? No, don't think so.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.478
Who fancies a pint or three?

32:58.479 --> 33:00.919
Or five. It's the last day of term. Fuck it.

33:00.919 --> 33:03.598
Forgive me for butting in, Mr McKenna.

33:03.599 --> 33:07.169
Matthew. The local rag.
Property pages at the back.

33:07.480 --> 33:10.600
If your wife would like advice
on which areas to look at...

33:10.600 --> 33:13.920
- I'll tell her to call you.
- You're married?! Fuck!

33:13.920 --> 33:16.640
You kept that quiet.
I had you down as one of us.

33:16.640 --> 33:19.479
- Fucking hell.
- Have you got any kids?

33:19.480 --> 33:21.479
Yeah, two.

33:21.480 --> 33:24.039
- (Brian) Fucking hell!
- How lovely.

33:24.039 --> 33:26.238
But when you come down the pub,

33:26.239 --> 33:28.799
- you're not bringing them?
- Course not.

33:28.799 --> 33:31.839
- You can bring the wife though.
- Only if she's fit.

33:31.839 --> 33:34.839
- (Brian) Is she?
- Is she what?

33:34.999 --> 33:37.918
- Fit.
- (Susan) He must think so.

33:37.919 --> 33:40.959
(Jenny) Since she's unavailable,
it doesn't matter.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.439
- (Brian) Who says?
- She's married.

33:43.439 --> 33:46.439
(Kurt) Yeah, but is she fit?

33:53.639 --> 33:56.160
- I'll catch you up.
- Where are you going?

33:56.160 --> 33:59.730
I should say thanks to Penny
for showing me around.

33:59.879 --> 34:01.960
- Don't ask her to the pub.
- God, no.

34:01.960 --> 34:05.840
- She's got a face like a slapped arse.
- Don't even mention the pub.

34:05.840 --> 34:09.679
- She'll turn up uninvited as usual.
- Seems you don't like her much.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.918
- Really?
- I thought she was OK.

34:11.918 --> 34:14.918
You're wrong. See you later.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.320
I guess I owe you an apology.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.478
I was going to tell you.
It just wasn't the right time.

34:33.478 --> 34:36.119
You thought you'd wait
till after you shagged me.

34:36.119 --> 34:39.679
- We were shagging each other.
- What's the difference?

34:39.679 --> 34:42.679
What happened wasn't entirely my fault.

34:43.239 --> 34:46.120
You don't think your wife
might blame you a bit?

34:46.120 --> 34:49.900
- My wife won't find out.
- If you'd told me the truth

34:50.040 --> 34:53.079
I could have made up my own mind
whether to sleep with you.

34:53.079 --> 34:55.478
And would you have done?

34:55.480 --> 34:58.480
- No.
- I don't believe you.

35:00.559 --> 35:02.679
I thought we'd be friends.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.398
Oh, grow up, for fuck's sake.

35:05.399 --> 35:07.840
You're not a teenager. Neither am I.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.000
We're a couple of adults who had sex

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
- when maybe we shouldn't.
- Maybe?

35:18.399 --> 35:21.399
I'm going to the pub. See you next year.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.760
Two hours, 23 minutes and 10 seconds.

35:41.999 --> 35:44.399
Wouldn't you rather be down the pub?

35:44.399 --> 35:47.880
- With Kurt and your boyfriend?
- Don't call him that!

35:47.880 --> 35:50.120
- You love Brian, don't you?
- Fuck off.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.159
- You want to marry him.
- Fuck off.

35:52.159 --> 35:55.559
You want to have his babies
and grow old together in a bungalow.

35:55.559 --> 35:58.559
- Fuck off.
- You do.

36:09.319 --> 36:12.079
- (Matt) Same again?
- What's the hurry?

36:12.079 --> 36:14.319
I said I'd be home for the kids' bedtime.

36:14.319 --> 36:17.759
- Does it matter if you're not?
- No, but I like to be there.

36:17.759 --> 36:20.519
- So just one more pint?
- Yeah.

36:20.520 --> 36:24.440
Ah, fuck it. I'll say the train broke down
at Bracknell.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.239
Your train goes nowhere near Bracknell.

36:30.239 --> 36:33.239
I caught the wrong train. Even better.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.878
Just popped home for half an hour.

36:40.879 --> 36:45.359
I suggested oral sex.
I just mentioned it, you know, in passing.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.558
Next thing I know, she's heading south.

36:48.559 --> 36:51.879
This is after we've done it
doggie fashion on the landing.

36:51.879 --> 36:54.919
I don't know what's got into her.
Apart from me.

36:54.919 --> 36:58.139
Three times last night,
twice this lunch time.

36:59.279 --> 37:02.919
No, all I'm saying is
she can do better for herself.

37:03.600 --> 37:08.290
I could be head of IT in a few years.
What's Rat Boy ever gonna be?

37:08.479 --> 37:09.979
Head of test tubes

37:10.599 --> 37:13.889
with special responsibility
for Bunsen burners?

37:15.640 --> 37:18.650
Tears were dripping down
her little cheeks.

37:19.839 --> 37:22.359
It was like I'd molested her.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.360
I felt like a paedophile.

37:26.159 --> 37:29.159
I'm a fucking nonce!

37:30.200 --> 37:33.200
Right, that's me. I'm off.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.598
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.

37:37.599 --> 37:40.598
See you next term.

37:40.599 --> 37:42.718
Shit, we're gonna be late.

37:42.719 --> 37:46.919
Fuck it. I don't care.
Let's spend the rest of the day here.

37:47.039 --> 37:50.039
No. I've got to see Kayla.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.800
I've got to say sorry for making her cry.

37:54.399 --> 37:57.549
- OK. Then I'll go and see Carol.
- What for?

37:58.639 --> 38:02.319
I'm gonna tell her she shouldn't
waste her life with Rat Boy.

38:02.319 --> 38:05.319
Good idea.

38:08.959 --> 38:11.959
(Glass smashing)

38:25.319 --> 38:27.639
Can I speak to Kayla, please?

38:27.640 --> 38:30.440
- Jesus, how much have you had?
- Couple of pints.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.440
Is she here?

38:35.679 --> 38:39.599
I just wanted to say how sorry I am
about what happened.

38:40.639 --> 38:42.799
- Eugh, you stink!
- Shh!

38:42.800 --> 38:47.160
- If Mrs Hunter smells your breath...
- I'm trying to apologise.

38:47.160 --> 38:50.160
I'm really, really sorry I made you cry.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.360
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

38:53.360 --> 38:57.420
- I did a very bad thing and I'm sorry.
- Yeah, all right.

38:58.399 --> 39:01.399
(♪ Haven: Beautiful Thing)

39:06.920 --> 39:09.920
What I said was
unprofessional and cruel.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.919
Just forget it.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.920
- You forgive me?
- Whatever.

39:22.559 --> 39:26.759
- You're pissed, aren't you?
- I had a beer with Mr McKenna.

39:26.920 --> 39:31.119
He needed cheering up.
Your mum said some very cruel things.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.198
- About Mr McKenna?
- Yeah.

39:33.199 --> 39:36.039
She said he wasn't very big.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.398
I mean, not tall. Short.

39:38.399 --> 39:41.000
He's a very short bloke.
That's what she said.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.570
- And he got upset?
- Well, he's not normal, is he?

39:53.160 --> 39:56.310
(Kurt) I know I could have
handled it better.

39:56.999 --> 40:00.569
I should have talked to you,
returned your calls...

40:01.720 --> 40:04.720
not run away and hidden quite so much.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.478
I'm not saying I want you back,

40:08.479 --> 40:12.189
I just don't want
to see you throwing your life away.

40:13.200 --> 40:16.200
You could do better.

40:16.399 --> 40:19.399
Maybe... not a lot...

40:19.720 --> 40:22.959
- but better than Rat Boy.
- What did you call me?

40:22.959 --> 40:25.959
Rat Boy! It's just a nickname.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.800
(Bell)

40:36.799 --> 40:39.558
- So that's it.
- Hm.

40:39.559 --> 40:43.059
I thought that's what you wanted,
the end of term.

40:43.199 --> 40:46.419
Yeah, but it's only 349 hours
till we're back.

40:50.079 --> 40:53.079
Liz! Hang about.

40:54.760 --> 40:58.559
I can't spend the holiday worrying
about seeing you again.

40:58.559 --> 41:01.239
What's to worry about?

41:01.240 --> 41:04.240
I made Kayla cry.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.200
You can't imagine how bad
I feel right now.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.079
Whatever you call me,
I've been calling myself worse.

41:11.079 --> 41:14.840
I don't know how it happened.
Well, I do, cos I was there.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.620
But I didn't mean to push her too far
but I must have.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.199
For fuck's sake, Brian, do be quiet.

41:21.199 --> 41:23.359
I know what happened
with you and Kayla.

41:23.359 --> 41:26.359
- You know?
- She lied about the earrings.

41:26.599 --> 41:29.599
She had her ears pierced
in the summer.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.770
She didn't really cry.
I paid her ten quid.

41:32.879 --> 41:35.118
- Hey?
- I felt sorry for you.

41:35.119 --> 41:39.249
She's tricky so I asked her
to pretend to be afraid of you.

41:39.679 --> 41:41.919
Just once. Before the end of term.

41:41.919 --> 41:44.038
Why?

41:44.039 --> 41:47.039
Christmas present. From me to you.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.318
But I haven't got you anything.

41:51.319 --> 41:53.598
- That's OK.
- I could shag you.

41:53.599 --> 41:55.638
No. Really.

41:55.639 --> 41:58.799
- You were gonna let me.
- Before I slept with Kurt.

41:58.799 --> 42:01.800
I don't want to risk
any more disappointments this week.

42:01.800 --> 42:05.039
I wouldn't be a disappointment.
Ask Susan what she thought.

42:05.039 --> 42:08.189
Brian, I don't want sex.
I just want a drink.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.920
(Chatting and laughter)

42:29.199 --> 42:31.879
(Susan) That's not really a bruise.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.239
Just looks like you're wearing make-up.

42:34.239 --> 42:36.358
- Ah!
- What happened?

42:36.359 --> 42:38.999
If you'd turned up today you'd know.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.199
He caught you copping off with Carol?

42:41.199 --> 42:42.999
No.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.200
- I called him Rat Boy.
- But that's his name.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.759
No, Brian, his name is Errol.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.759
- Is it?
- (Liz) Carol!

42:50.760 --> 42:53.770
Come and join us.
Is... Errol not with you?

42:56.479 --> 42:59.479
I told him to fuck off.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.840
So he did.

43:03.480 --> 43:05.719
Would you like a drink?

43:05.720 --> 43:08.398
Yes. The usual.

43:08.399 --> 43:11.639
Pint of lager and a Baileys chaser?
Coming right up.

43:11.639 --> 43:13.919
(Brian) If you're going, I'll have another.

43:13.919 --> 43:16.279
- A large Scotch.
- Make it two.

43:16.280 --> 43:19.280
I'll give you a hand.

43:22.559 --> 43:25.480
You don't think
they'll start shagging again?

43:25.480 --> 43:29.470
That would be tricky,
given they've never shagged before.

43:31.120 --> 43:35.040
Carol told me. When they went out,
they didn't have sex.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.720
Maybe they did but she didn't realise.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.720
- You said his willy's very small.
- No...

43:41.039 --> 43:43.419
- They only kissed.
- On the lips?

43:43.919 --> 43:46.718
- Yes.
- Tongues?

43:46.719 --> 43:49.119
- Sometimes.
- Is she a virgin?

43:49.120 --> 43:52.120
- No!
- Did she and Rat Boy...?

43:53.079 --> 43:55.959
- I couldn't bring myself to ask.
- No.

43:55.960 --> 43:59.199
He always banging on
about how much he'd shagged her.

43:59.199 --> 44:02.158
- Male bravado.
- Lying bastard.

44:02.159 --> 44:04.320
- They're coming.
- Not a word.

44:04.320 --> 44:07.750
- I promised I wouldn't tell.
- You just told us.

44:07.840 --> 44:10.840
- In confidence!
- So, Carol...

44:12.320 --> 44:14.360
I hear Kurt never shagged you.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.399
- For fuck's sake.
- Yes, I did!

44:16.399 --> 44:19.969
Kurt, tell me the truth.
Did you really shag Carol?

44:21.759 --> 44:25.819
I didn't exactly shag her
in the normal sense of the word.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.080
Why not? What's wrong with you?

44:29.240 --> 44:31.359
We thought we'd...

44:31.360 --> 44:34.360
you know...

44:36.399 --> 44:39.399
save ourselves.
