Absolutely.
More power.

Hmm. I have to remind you.
That seems...

07:28.360 --> 07:31.113
That seems like
a little the opposite, right?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.200
Yeah.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.831
Okay. Yeah,
I think if you keep your...

07:34.920 --> 07:37.639
You need to keep your tongue inside
your mouth for this to work.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.474
Last week you very specifically said,
"Keep tongue out."

07:41.560 --> 07:43.152
No.
You did say that, Claire.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.276
I said, "Get your tongue out of
the picture."

breathe, Claire.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.632

hangry, Claire.

Right?

08:24.080 --> 08:26.594

you told me to remind you
exactly a year ago today

08:43.600 --> 08:47.229
that it's been three years
since my last pay increase.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.833
I don't think that's true.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.558
That doesn't ring...

08:50.640 --> 08:52.278
Does that seem
accurate to you?

08:52.640 --> 08:54.392
That sounds false.

it tonight!

down what you said.

you always have to quote.

A little birdie told me

that Takoro was merging
with Samson International.

It's "Ron," and you're from Jersey.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.359
Phil. Take off that
ridiculous top.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.198
You should
never cover that up.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.315
Okay.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.354
Please don't forget you have an
interview first thing Monday.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.509
MICHELLE: We'll see.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.277
Let me just... Let me just
help you out there.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.432
You'll regret
this, Michelle!

11:47.720 --> 11:49.073
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

11:52.480 --> 11:54.198
Get me the SEC.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
Okay.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.595
We are back with the one and only,
Michelle Darnell.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.875
Let's talk about your
relationship with your mentor,

12:01.960 --> 12:04.315
that mega mogul,
Ida Marquette.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.553
Well, Gayle, we've got
a terrific relationship.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.278
Really? I'm so
surprised to hear that,

12:09.360 --> 12:12.716
only because we came across
this tape the other day. Take a look.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.070
Oh.
IDA: <i>I was Michelle's mentor.</i>

12:15.160 --> 12:16.832
<i>It's so hard to describe her.</i>

12:16.920 --> 12:20.913
<i>She's a business woman,
a visionary, a leader,</i>

12:21.000 --> 12:23.514
<i>a natural born</i>
(BLEEPING) <i>cocksucker, a motherfucker,</i>

12:23.600 --> 12:25.795
<i>an ass-wipe, a shit stain,</i>

12:25.880 --> 12:29.668
<i>and sewer rat,
fuck-face, professional.</i>

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
(SNICKERING)

12:31.240 --> 12:32.832
Doesn't sound so chummy.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.793
Oh, I think a couple of those
beeps were actually compliments.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.438
That's one way
to look at it.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.158
Michelle, I want to
talk about you.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.232
That you were, basically,
abandoned as a child,

12:42.320 --> 12:44.834
bounced around from foster
home to foster home,

12:44.920 --> 12:47.753
and that, really, you were
raised in an orphanage.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.114
No, no, no.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.513
I was lucky enough to attend a beautiful,
lovely elite boarding school,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.194
very much like Hogwarts,
to give you a visual.

12:57.280 --> 13:00.636
And almost as magical.
I feel very lucky.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.148
Where'd you get that?

13:07.240 --> 13:08.896
GAYLE: We've got a really
good research team,

13:08.920 --> 13:10.856
and when I look at that picture,
I don't think "elite."

13:10.880 --> 13:12.552
Can we talk about
this for a second?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.796
This interview is over.
Where are you going?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.440
I was not trying to
upset you, Michelle.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.016
Why are you leaving?
MICHELLE: You know what, Gayle?

13:19.040 --> 13:21.873
Nobody spells "Gayle" with a "Y ".
It's pretentious.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.759
You've got a great
story to tell.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.193
Keeping the mic!

13:26.080 --> 13:28.720
Gayle King ambushed me.
You get that segment pulled before it airs.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.936
Miss Darnell,
you're under arrest

13:29.960 --> 13:32.721
for insider trading and defrauding
the Securities Exchange Commission.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.429
Are you kidding me?

13:34.520 --> 13:35.669
Would I kid you?

13:35.760 --> 13:37.239
Claire, call my lawyer.
Okay.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.355
Stay back.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.396
What do you make a year?
I'll double it.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.629
Did you just try
to bribe me?

13:41.720 --> 13:44.154
No. I mean,
unless you're tempted...

13:44.920 --> 13:46.592
Hey! This is...

13:46.720 --> 13:48.950
This is not
reasonable. Claire!

13:49.040 --> 13:50.440
Don't fight it, Michelle!
Let me go!

13:50.800 --> 13:52.074
Ooh. Don't struggle, baby!

13:54.040 --> 13:55.314
Renault ratted me out!

13:55.400 --> 13:58.312
It's just insider trading!
Everybody does it!

13:58.440 --> 14:00.237
You are fighting
with the wrong redhead!

14:01.760 --> 14:02.760
(GRUNTS)

14:02.840 --> 14:04.558
Yeah. I'm out.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.200
I'mma get my job back
at Best Buy. Boom!

14:07.960 --> 14:09.393
God, you're the worst.

you'd regret it.

STEPHAN: You can really
hold onto a grudge.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.558
I can't believe
you two used to date.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.016
RENAULT: Ah. It was
the Go-Go Nineties.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.235
She was my yin,
I was her yang.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.957
Our bodies were intertwined, but our
spirits were in constant opposition.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.275
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.696
Don't worry.
Once I become senior VP,

14:43.720 --> 14:45.040
nothing's gonna
change between us.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.078
It better not. You look so
fucking rad when you do coke.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.876
BRYCE: Hey, guys! Guys!

14:50.960 --> 14:52.029

14:52.160 --> 14:54.080
They're about to announce
who gets the promotion.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.275

think that you can take

15:17.000 --> 15:18.638

wasn't gonna notice.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.755
You bitch.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.593
Oh, thank you!
That's so supportive, Ron.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.432
I couldn't have
done it without you.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.319

MICHELLE:
It's bullshit, Marty.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.068
I take one little
tip from an insider

15:40.160 --> 15:42.435
and I find myself in
an absolute hellhole.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.876
I mean, look at me,
fighting for my life in the yard.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.359
MARTY: Well,
the news gets worse.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.869
All your accounts have been frozen.
MICHELLE: What?

15:50.160 --> 15:52.196
Your shareholders
have all sold off.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.157
Renault is orchestrating
a hostile takeover

15:54.280 --> 15:56.111
of your entire
holding company.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.111
No.
Darnell Enterprises is bankrupt.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.839
Can he do that?
Turn off the machine, Don.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.114
No, he cannot.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.873
Yes, he can.
He actually did it beautifully.

That's my Adam's apple,
you bitch!

16:12.120 --> 16:13.951
Claire, get me
a new lawyer.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.176
There's not gonna
be another lawyer

any money,

16:16.400 --> 16:17.674
you stupid ginger!

16:18.480 --> 16:21.153
You know what?
I'm a ginger, but I'm a natural redhead.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.719
Not that you're
ever gonna find out.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.473
Because you will never be
invited into my basement.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.232
I don't wanna
see your basement!

16:27.320 --> 16:28.320
MICHELLE: Yes, you do!

16:28.400 --> 16:30.231
And by the way,
Claire works for me.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.400
CLAIRE: Actually, Michelle,

16:31.920 --> 16:34.388
I can't work for you anymore.
I got a new job.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.232
I just came to tell
you as a courtesy.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.392
I would think
a courtesy would be

16:38.480 --> 16:40.755
you sticking with me through
my tough times, Claire.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.910
I would. You know
I have a kid to think about, so...

16:43.000 --> 16:44.353
You have a kid?

16:45.760 --> 16:48.149
I can't tell if you're joking
because I did tell you

16:48.240 --> 16:50.196
that I do have
a kid. And I... I am.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.320
Remember?
Yes.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.755
You do?
I am. I'm joking. I gotcha.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.068
Okay.

I wasn't into you but I was flattered.

Okay, here we go. Tom, do
you mind grabbing that bag for me?

17:06.440 --> 17:08.192
Kimberly, I thought
you had today off.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.376
Yeah, I knew
you were leaving.

You're sweet, Kimberly.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.359
Now, you're gonna remember
what I told you?

Yes.
Okay?

go up and down.

much, Michelle.

miss you around here. (SIGHS)

It sounds right to me.

sweeter out here.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.834
Did you set up a ride?

17:40.920 --> 17:42.478
No, I was assuming
that a town car

17:42.560 --> 17:44.073
or something
would be provided.

a town car was coming!

17:50.120 --> 17:51.758
Well, could you
call a cab?

17:54.800 --> 17:55.994
I'll get one myself.

not very bright, or...

I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

I thought you were in jail.

19:20.520 --> 19:24.718
Aren't you charming for yelling
that out on the street like that.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.754
May I?

No way.

you're fresh out of prison.

crime doesn't count!

you are so late.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
I am?

20:04.280 --> 20:06.874
You're right. You're
absolutely right, Dana.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.678
I'm three minutes late.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.479
Hey, do you work at
the excuse factory?

20:12.120 --> 20:14.696
I wasn't making an excuse.
I was just agreeing that I was a little...

20:14.720 --> 20:16.073
Well, I think that
you're saying

20:16.160 --> 20:18.230
this is an
excuse factory, right?

MIKE: So, hey,
I wanted to tell you.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.416
There is a bunch of people
gathered in the break room...

20:23.440 --> 20:24.440
What, why?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.296
...just raving about
your fourth-quarter review.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.514
Who is? What?

20:27.800 --> 20:28.915
That's why I was late.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.794
Because we were all up there, you know,
trading our favorite Dana stories.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.677
So it was...
It's positive...

20:34.760 --> 20:36.216
It's good buzz?
There's a lot of good buzz?

20:36.240 --> 20:38.016
Buzzworthy. Absolutely, yeah.
I mean, they're raving.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.156
I have to go get coffee.
Yeah, you do. (CHUCKLING)

a lot of things.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.114
Uh... (CHUCKLING)

Look at this, look at this!
We have so much in common, me and you.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.160
We have a good
banter here, right?

20:51.240 --> 20:52.240
A little back and forth.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.753
I think maybe we should

20:53.840 --> 20:55.816
try and keep this little
banter wagon going, right?

20:55.840 --> 20:56.955
Maybe we can go hang out...

20:57.040 --> 21:00.555
We can dish about the boss,
and gossip about stuff and...

21:01.080 --> 21:02.976
You know, probably do it
over dinner or something,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.991
'cause all that dishing
can be exhausting.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.559
Work up an appetite.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.518
Yeah, well, I'm...
First of all, I'm flattered.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.200
It's a little
complicated for me.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.272
I'm a single mom and I
really try to, you know,

21:14.360 --> 21:16.316
devote a ton of
energy to my kid,

21:16.400 --> 21:17.576
and see her as
much as possible.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.592
I just don't think
that it's a good time.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.238
Yeah, cool.

21:22.320 --> 21:23.833
I was hoping
you would say that

21:23.920 --> 21:26.036
because I love rejection,
so... (CHUCKLING)

21:26.440 --> 21:27.634
Cool.
Cool.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.755
Sorry.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.877
(SNORING)
Michelle.

21:49.760 --> 21:50.795
Michelle.
(GASPS)

21:53.480 --> 21:55.436
MICHELLE: Hello.
Hi!

21:56.560 --> 21:58.232
Hi. Hello, Claire.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.709
Surprise!

21:59.800 --> 22:01.392
What are you
doing here?

22:01.560 --> 22:04.518
Oh, well, I had stopped
at our old office

22:05.080 --> 22:07.230
and the security
gentlemen did mention

22:07.320 --> 22:10.551
that you were now
the curator of my estate.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.150
So, I just thought
I should pop over

22:14.240 --> 22:16.037
and maybe
pick up my things.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.957
Okay, I guess you wanna
come up and grab it.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.076
Yes, absolutely.
Do you need...

22:22.760 --> 22:25.069
If you'd like,
you can grab that trunk.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
Oh, no.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.914
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:32.000 --> 22:33.479
Well, this is just...

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
This is...

22:36.720 --> 22:37.994
This can't be all of it.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.911
I mean,
this isn't all of it. This is...

22:40.680 --> 22:42.272
Where are my things?

22:42.760 --> 22:46.514
My paintings, or, I mean,
my Degas, my rugs, my...

22:47.040 --> 22:49.759
Where are my things?
I'm really sorry, Michelle.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.512
They seized everything.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.914
This is what's left.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.155
(SIGHS)

23:02.480 --> 23:05.119
Martha Stewart
got everything back.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.794
I mean, they rallied around her.
They loved her more.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.634
Well, Michelle, know that Rachel
and I are rooting for you,

23:11.720 --> 23:14.757
and, if you need us,
you can always call

23:14.880 --> 23:17.917
or send a letter here,
or just a quick text.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.080
Um, do you want me to
help you out with this?

23:21.600 --> 23:24.353
If she doesn't have anywhere to go,
she should stay here.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.989
Honey, she knows plenty of people.
She has plenty of places to stay.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.715
Tito won't return
any of my calls.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.673
My sweet Tito.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.118
Fucking Tito.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.355
(SIGHS)

23:36.440 --> 23:38.829
Mom, we can't let her
sleep on the street.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.116
Do you really not
have anywhere to go?

23:41.640 --> 23:43.198
No. I don't.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.157
Okay, you can
stay here.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.915
But for a very limited
amount of time. Okay?

23:48.040 --> 23:49.576
Yes. Just until you get
back on your feet.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
All right?
MICHELLE: Yes.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.120
CLAIRE: It's a small
space. You know.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.077
It's tight sometimes
for Rachel and I, so...

23:54.200 --> 23:57.112
It is really small, it's
like... It's freaky small.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.395
Well, but you're
welcome, here.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.199
If you need to crash,
you can have the couch.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.191
Yes. We'll draw straws.
Okay.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.350
It'll be a fun
kind of roommate...

24:06.440 --> 24:07.475
It's not a negotiation.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.669
...stuff. Okay.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.600
Ha.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.952
A bed inside a sofa.
That's neat.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.554
Well, it's old,
but it's comfortable, so...

24:18.200 --> 24:19.315
Thank you, Claire.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.915
Good night, Michelle.

24:25.960 --> 24:26.995
It's...

24:28.840 --> 24:29.875
Well...

24:32.400 --> 24:33.400
This isn't so...

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
(YELPING)

24:34.720 --> 24:37.314
(GROANING)
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

24:43.360 --> 24:44.429
Claire!

24:45.640 --> 24:48.234
I think I've
shattered my pelvis.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.840
(SOFT GROAN)

25:00.840 --> 25:02.831
(GASPS) Oh, Michelle!
Oh, my God.

25:02.920 --> 25:03.989
Claire!

25:04.080 --> 25:06.833
Michelle, why
are you in my bed?

25:06.920 --> 25:09.070
Because your sofa
threw me against a wall,

25:09.200 --> 25:11.350
and I've had a cellie
for the last six months.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.273
I find it very difficult
to sleep on my own.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.552
Wow. Okay.
You're kicking up a lot of...

25:16.640 --> 25:18.278
Is that from...
Is that me?

25:18.360 --> 25:19.360
I think...
(BLOWS)

25:19.440 --> 25:21.032
Yeah, that's me.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.599
You know what?
I got into

25:22.680 --> 25:24.352
a wee bit of your
Scotch last night.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.431
And, you know
what else I tried

25:26.560 --> 25:28.596
that I thought was
terrific, was a Dorito.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.189
I think it was
the cheese.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.875
I mean not a cheese found in nature,
but cheese-adjacent.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.394
I just thought
it was wonderful.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.913
What a wonderful chip.

25:38.840 --> 25:42.116
(SIGHS) Michelle, you can't sleep in my bed.
I don't want you in here.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.679
You gotta get it
together, Michelle.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.478
I am together, okay?

25:45.560 --> 25:48.313
This morning, I'm meeting with
a bunch of old colleagues.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.953
I'm gonna pour this
into something

25:50.040 --> 25:51.519
creamy and delicious,

25:51.600 --> 25:53.192
and see who
takes a big sip.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.673
Get out, out of my bed.

25:54.760 --> 25:59.038
God. I see why this half
of the bed maybe is empty.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.879
Okay? You're a real
B-I-T-C-U-N-T in the morning.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.757
You think about that.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.720
Michelle, you gotta
get out of the bathroom.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.752
I'm already late for work and
Rachel's gonna be late for school.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.456
MICHELLE: Well, I'm going
as fast as I can.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.833
You're welcome
to come in.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.914
Fine, but we gotta get on a
schedule if you're gonna be here...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.194
(GASPS)
Oh, my God!

26:18.960 --> 26:20.029
Close your robe.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.275
No, absolutely not!

26:21.360 --> 26:24.397
I'm self-tanning and
my legs are still wet.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.592
I can see your vagina.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.194
Well, congratulations
and you're welcome!

26:29.280 --> 26:31.669
You know, I had it
rejuvenated in 2010.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.637
They call it
a vaguvenation!

26:34.160 --> 26:36.833
You know, it's like
a soft silk coin purse.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.512
I can barely urinate.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.669
Oh, my God!

26:39.760 --> 26:40.829
Now, do me a favor

26:40.920 --> 26:43.150
and tell me if I have
any streaks on my hamstrings.

26:43.240 --> 26:44.389
(GASPS) Oh, God!
Put it away!

26:44.600 --> 26:45.715
Whoa.
Put it away.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.952
Hi, Raquel!

26:48.040 --> 26:49.109
It's Rachel!

26:49.200 --> 26:50.320
Go grab your
backpack, honey.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.715
We don't need to brush our teeth today.
Our teeth are fine.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.512
You need to wipe some of that off your face.
You know it dries darker?

26:56.600 --> 26:58.192
No, does it?
CLAIRE: Yes.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.111
But that's not
what the bottle says.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.836
Oh, it's okay. It's coming off
like a dream on your towel.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.560
CLAIRE: You need to
clean up the bathroom.

27:06.600 --> 27:10.115
And consider staying away
from self-tanner altogether.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.078
Your pelvic region
is the color of curry.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.311
(WHISPERING) <i>Namaste,</i>
Claire. Thank you.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.549
It's not a compliment.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.680
Oh.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.480
(MOANING)

27:23.680 --> 27:25.656
BRYCE: All right, here's
a little joke for everybody.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.638
What do golfers do
on their day off?

27:29.400 --> 27:30.400
Putter around.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.198
(ALL LAUGHING)

27:35.960 --> 27:37.837
Tom, I'm gonna crunch
those numbers for you,

27:37.920 --> 27:39.800
but I'm going to make you
pay through the teeth.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.668
Oh.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.954
Bryce Crean!

27:43.040 --> 27:46.077
Oh, my God!
How long has it been?

27:46.400 --> 27:49.039
You old son of a bitch!
It has been too long!

27:49.120 --> 27:51.315
Terri. Hello, gentlemen. Hi...

27:51.920 --> 27:52.955
Carl.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.673
Oh. Look at that beard.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.149
How's that old ball-and-chain
Pam treatin' ya? (CHUCKLING)

27:58.200 --> 27:59.918
Pam passed away
four months ago.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.078
(SOFTLY) That's tough.
That's tough.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.976
We're kind of in the middle of
something here, Michelle.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.274
So, thank you very much.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.757
Word on the street,
Bryce, is that

28:09.920 --> 28:11.751
you're just about to
close on that Kraft deal.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.354
So if you want me to
head up that division...

28:14.440 --> 28:18.433
I think I could be a pretty big
asset to you on that account.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.753
You've got no capital
and nobody likes you.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.558
Nobody here at
this table likes you.

28:23.720 --> 28:26.296
Nobody at this entire club likes you.
(WHISPERING) That's not true.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.356
Horrible, horrible
feedback from everybody.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.951
So, thank you for
the groveling. Good bye!

28:34.120 --> 28:35.394
Fuck off, Bryce.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.199
Yeah. You know what?

28:37.840 --> 28:39.114
You wouldn't even be here

28:39.200 --> 28:41.395
if I hadn't brought you
in as a junior executive.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.800
And, Terri, you think
anybody else

28:42.880 --> 28:44.176
would've hired you
right out of college?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.031
No! I don't who
the fuck you three are.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
But I'll guess this.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.276
I bet you got here
climbing on my back somehow.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.316
Carl, I gave you
that Landis account.

28:51.400 --> 28:55.598
I handed you your career and I'm
the one that made Pam a sales rep!

28:55.680 --> 28:56.795
Pam is dead.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.319
Pam was a whore!

28:58.400 --> 29:00.994
She fucked her way through
the whole IT department.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.196
And Terri knows it,
'cause you were in on it, too!

29:03.520 --> 29:04.999
MICHELLE: Yeah!
CARL: The tech guys?

29:05.080 --> 29:06.559
You think Pam did
all the tech guys?

29:06.680 --> 29:10.275
The lowest, weirdest,
saddest guys!

29:10.360 --> 29:11.679
That's who Pam fucked!

29:11.760 --> 29:13.239
Go to hell, Michelle!
Go to hell!

29:13.320 --> 29:16.118
When I get to hell,
I'll tell Pam that you said hello,

29:16.200 --> 29:18.270
'cause she's probably down
there fucking IT guys.

29:18.400 --> 29:22.632
Weird little guys,
carrying wires around in weird hats.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.278
That's who she's
fucking in hell.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.360
Yeah.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.749
I don't need you.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.479
I don't need you and
you're gonna be sorry.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.993
'Cause I got
a sweet deal for you

29:31.160 --> 29:32.593
and you're
letting it walk out.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.148
You know, you want to be dumbasses?
Be my guest.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.390
I'll tell you what,
you're gonna regret this.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.075
Yow!

29:39.200 --> 29:40.519
(GROANING)

29:40.880 --> 29:42.916
Yow! Son of a bitch!

29:44.880 --> 29:46.518
Holy shit!
Son of a bitch!

29:46.600 --> 29:48.033
How'd she survive that?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.792
BRYCE: 'Cause she's horrible.

29:49.880 --> 29:50.949
Let's go.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.553
MICHELLE: Mother of shite!

29:54.040 --> 29:55.519
I dinged my pelvis again.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.680
Ah.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.315
(EXHALES)

30:05.400 --> 30:06.799
Tell me everything.
Okay.

30:06.880 --> 30:11.158
So, right off the top,
Bryce ordered a Nicoise salad

30:11.240 --> 30:13.629
but he asked for the tuna
to be really well done.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.096
But if it's a quality piece of tuna,
you don't wanna have it...

30:16.120 --> 30:18.076
Not relevant.
Okay, right.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.589
Bryce did everything
you asked him to do.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.880
Michelle came in.
She was like,

30:22.920 --> 30:24.000
"I wanna be in a business."

30:24.080 --> 30:25.638
And he was like,
"No dice."

30:25.760 --> 30:28.354
And then, she fell
down a flight of stairs.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.476
(GASPS) Did she hurt
her wonderful body?

30:30.560 --> 30:32.437
I have a video of it.
Do you wanna see?

30:34.760 --> 30:35.920
MICHELLE: I'll tell you what.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.480
Oh, look at her.
STEPHAN: Mmm-hmm.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.275
Oh. (LAUGHING)

30:39.920 --> 30:41.194
(BOTH LAUGHING)

30:43.000 --> 30:44.513
Oh.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.238
DR. OZ: <i>So you see
the normal intestine.</i>

30:48.600 --> 30:51.672
<i>Now, notice the difference between
that intestine and this intestine.</i>

30:51.760 --> 30:54.832
I'm getting light-headed.
Is there any of that brownie left?

30:54.960 --> 30:56.837
Yeah. I feel like my
blood sugar's dropping.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.912
I should probably pop
it with a little sugar.

31:01.640 --> 31:04.916
Holy shit!
That is a good brownie.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Language.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.976
Well, I'm sorry,
you give me a holy-shit brownie.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.194
I'm gonna say,
"Holy shit!"

31:09.280 --> 31:13.193
'Cause holy shit,
this is a good brownie.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.589
I can't believe...
Your mom makes these, right?

31:15.680 --> 31:17.591
Yeah, it's a family recipe.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.029
Hi!

31:20.840 --> 31:23.718
I'm pretty sure Michelle
has diverticulitis.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.119
What?
MICHELLE: I got it.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.757
I think it's
pretty advanced, Claire.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.068
CLAIRE: Who said that?

31:29.160 --> 31:30.229
Doctor Oz.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.469
MICHELLE: Look.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.715
Oh, my God!

31:32.800 --> 31:34.392
There's my colon again.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.278
Okay, you need
to get off the couch

31:37.360 --> 31:39.715
because you've been laying
down for about three weeks.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.234
And, also, you have to start
pulling your weight around here.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.435
We can start tonight.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.590
You can take Rachel
to her Dandelions meeting.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.631
What?
Why aren't you taking me?

31:47.720 --> 31:48.755
Sweetie, I can't.

31:48.840 --> 31:53.072
My boss, who is a massive fan of yours,
by the way,

31:53.160 --> 31:55.390
has decided I need to go
back in for the evening.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.520
CLAIRE: Okay?
(CLAPS HANDS)

31:56.600 --> 32:00.513
Let's go! The most important part of
the plan being "get off the couch."

32:03.080 --> 32:05.674
I don't think I
like sassy Claire.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.640
MICHELLE: All right. I want you to
give me the lowdown on this meeting.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.750
What are my opportunities?
What are my pitfalls?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.159
RACHEL: What do you mean?

32:14.240 --> 32:16.435
MICHELLE: Well, I want to know
what I'm walking into.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.556
RACHEL: Oh,
everyone's pretty nice.

32:19.720 --> 32:24.430
I forgot how many people ride the "L."
It's kind of fascinating.

32:24.520 --> 32:28.433
Some people depend on this.
Like, they don't have a car.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.155
Well, I know that.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.516
MICHELLE: Roller-skating
or roller-blading?

32:34.440 --> 32:35.475
Roller-blading.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.278
Honey or agave nectar?

32:37.360 --> 32:39.032
Agave.
No, they're both terrible.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.317
Cell phone, landline?

32:41.400 --> 32:43.630
What?
Oh, God.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.798
Do you not know
what that means?

32:45.880 --> 32:47.836
No.
(SIGHS) Oh, Jesus.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.710
MICHELLE: Okay, this
should be interesting.

32:52.040 --> 32:55.430
Ladies, big news.
Great news.

32:56.240 --> 33:00.438
Marsha Swan's tabby cat,
Spaghetti, is on the mend

33:00.520 --> 33:03.671
and expected to
make a full recovery.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.034
Yay, Spaghetti!

33:07.600 --> 33:08.715
Yay!

33:10.160 --> 33:12.993
My daughter, Beth,
was so worried about Spaghetti.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.991
Thank goodness she's
back on her feet.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.072
Funny fact about Spaghetti,
she hates spaghetti.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.397
You seem fucking
crazy to me.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.480
Excuse me?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.158
Cute as a daisy to me.
(GIGGLING)

33:24.000 --> 33:26.150
SANDY: Okay, now,
not to sound too kookie,

33:26.240 --> 33:29.073
but let's talk
"cookie" sales, that is.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.468
(ALL LAUGHING)

33:32.440 --> 33:36.672
Okay, so this year,
we came in with $21,000.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.717
Pretty good job, big bucks.

33:38.800 --> 33:44.591
But Detroit is still in the lead
for the year with $189,000.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.718
Can I just ask you,
are these numbers

33:46.840 --> 33:48.512
you're talking about
just cookie sales?

33:48.600 --> 33:51.558
And, if so, how many troupes
are we talking about here?

33:52.040 --> 33:57.239
There are 3.2 million
Dandelions all over the world

33:57.320 --> 34:00.357
blown across the earth,
making a difference.

34:00.440 --> 34:01.634
Is this global?

34:02.080 --> 34:05.356
Wait, I recognize you.
You're Michelle Darnell.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.198
Please, don't make a fuss.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.759
Oh, I'm gonna
make a fuss.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.672
You're a convicted felon sitting
in a room full of children.

34:11.760 --> 34:12.954
You're a criminal.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.393
It was white-collar crime.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.072
Okay, you don't
have to defend me.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.478
You're such
a loser.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.558
I'm sorry,
what did he say?

34:19.920 --> 34:20.920
What?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.295
SANDY: Well, I would...
(WHISPERING) Yeah.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.878
Excuse me. Hi.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.074
MICHELLE: I gotta ask you.

34:25.159 --> 34:28.914
Now are we talking part-time
or full-time employees here?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.911
Nope, just happy volunteers.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
What?

34:33.080 --> 34:34.911
For your information,
jailbird...

34:35.400 --> 34:36.753
She seems great.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.114
The Dandelions helps girls
build leadership skills.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.031
It looks good on their
high-school transcript

34:41.120 --> 34:42.678
and they are bettering
their community,

34:42.800 --> 34:44.279
which is more than
I can say for you.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.396
A-ha. What is your name?

34:46.520 --> 34:47.748
Helen Kreagan.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.478
Oh, you know what? I think you
dropped something right here.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.152
You go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.

34:52.679 --> 34:53.840
(WHISPERING)
Go fuck yourself.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.856
I don't think you know
who you're talking to.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.440
I think I do.
And I think I want you to fuck off.

34:58.520 --> 34:59.555
I don't think you do.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.520
(LAUGHING)

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
Oh, my gosh!

35:03.880 --> 35:07.190
Can we just take a minute and
give congrats to Sarah, here?

35:08.800 --> 35:11.758
Thank you.
It's Sandy. It's Sandy.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.472
Or Sandy.
I like Sarah.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.959
Whatever, either one.

35:15.040 --> 35:18.191
I gotta know how much
are you selling these boxes for?

35:18.640 --> 35:20.949
SANDY: Girls.
GROUP: $7.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.189
MICHELLE: $7?

35:22.720 --> 35:23.948
Ka-ching, right?

35:24.040 --> 35:28.033
I got a guy in Shanghai who can make
this same box of cookies, 19 cents.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.475
This is an official meeting
and you're interrupting it.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.152
Let's take a poll,
show of hands.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.918
Who finds Helen
to be a bummer?

35:35.840 --> 35:37.876
MICHELLE: Lots of hands.
Oh, Helen.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.678
Toot. (CHUCKLING)

35:39.760 --> 35:40.760
(CLEARS THROAT)

35:41.240 --> 35:42.878
Do something, Mom.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.119
I object to parolees
attending our meetings

35:46.200 --> 35:47.760
and I'd like to put
that in the minutes.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.229
May I?

35:49.320 --> 35:50.799
Let me just handle this.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.916
Another great point
by Helen.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.149
You know what, Helen?

35:54.240 --> 35:55.719
If you don't get
off my fucking back,

35:55.840 --> 35:59.037
I'm gonna shove a box of chocolate
clusters up that tight ass of yours.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.389
(GASPING)

36:00.480 --> 36:01.480
(GASPING) Oh.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.518
I would love
to go to lunch.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.713
You're on. You got yourself a date.
That sounds terrific, okay?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.797
MICHELLE: Sandy,
I love that kerchief.

36:09.880 --> 36:10.936
(SOFTLY) Was that necessary?

36:10.960 --> 36:12.473
Super necessary.
Yeah.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.953
(METAL RATTLING)

36:21.640 --> 36:22.959
(MICHELLE CHATTERING)

36:27.600 --> 36:28.919
CLAIRE: Michelle?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.435
Hi!
What are you doing?

36:30.520 --> 36:31.714
What is all this?

36:31.800 --> 36:33.358
This is my way
back, m'kay?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.795
You are looking
at Darnell 2.0.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.558
I wondered when
you were getting up.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.432
Have you not
gone to bed yet?

36:39.520 --> 36:41.272
No, I have been
up and percolating

36:41.360 --> 36:43.191
since 11:00 p.m.
last night.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.191
Just great stuff, Claire!
Okay.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.395
You're having a breakdown.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.995
No, no, no!
I'm having a breakthrough, because of you.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.877
Sit down,
I gotta show you this.

36:51.960 --> 36:56.476
Let me introduce you
to my new golden goose...

36:58.320 --> 37:00.629
Darnell's Darlings.

37:00.720 --> 37:01.869
Rough sketches.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.518
So, I know.
Those will be perfected.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.160
But, really, tell me,
what's your initial thoughts?

37:07.640 --> 37:09.392
Stalin.
Okay.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.232
Communist youth.
All right!

37:11.640 --> 37:14.313
Japanese-y black power?

37:14.400 --> 37:16.960
My takeaway from
that is "powerful."

37:17.320 --> 37:19.959
Powerful imagery and I'll take
that any day of the week.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.195
Why are you up?

37:22.320 --> 37:24.595
Sit down, sleepyhead.
Let's wake it up.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.070
Claire, we're gonna
start a brownie company.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.913
No, we're gonna
start a brownie empire.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.560
Okay? And we're gonna call it
Darnell's Darlings.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.037
Illinois alone has
25,000 Dandelions.

37:37.120 --> 37:41.989
They're pulling in,
in one year, $32,500,000.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.237
This is a global company.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.834
The Dandelions are making
a billion dollars a year.

37:47.240 --> 37:50.357
Is that going in your pocket?
Helen's probably pocketing it.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.271
I mean, that horrible
bitch would take teeth

37:52.400 --> 37:54.277
right out of a kid.
Am I wrong?

37:54.520 --> 37:57.830
If she could sell teeth,
she'd rip kids' teeth out.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.954
I'm gonna let it go,
but Helen's horrible.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.917
The Dandelions are
a non-profit, Michelle.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.160
That money goes back into
great programs for the girls.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.096
MICHELLE: Oh, great programs?
That's interesting.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.156
Rachel, do me a favor.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.755
Tell your mom what was the last
"great program" you completed.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.552
Go ahead, go ahead.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.677
Scout leader Sandy gave me a
"Social Butterfly" badge.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.954
That's great!

38:19.280 --> 38:21.475
Tell her what a
"Social Butterfly" badge is.

38:21.560 --> 38:26.031
I had to hold a conversation with
a new person for 30 minutes...

38:26.520 --> 38:27.669
Okay.
...and demonstrate

38:27.760 --> 38:29.318
how to be
a good hostess.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.918
Next week, I'm thinking
maybe they'll arrange marriages.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.196
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna design

38:35.320 --> 38:37.276
a special new badge
for the Dandelions.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.193
It's gonna be a real big one,
so no one misses it.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.032
And I'm gonna make it
a picture of a woman.

38:42.120 --> 38:46.079
A real sad woman with apron strings on,
bent over in front of an oven.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.296
And it's gonna say,
"You know why

38:47.320 --> 38:49.470
"we like vaginas
better than your mouth?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.755
"Because they don't have
teeth and they don't talk."

38:52.000 --> 38:54.320
And you could turn that badge
over and you're gonna realize

38:54.400 --> 38:56.840
that there's a man in the oven
and she's giving him a blowjob.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.315
Good luck earning that!

38:58.440 --> 38:59.589
Michelle!

38:59.840 --> 39:01.558
I heard everything anyways.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.956
These girls are gonna
earn some real money

39:04.040 --> 39:05.871
that can go
towards a college fund,

39:06.280 --> 39:09.875
give them empowerment,
give them a good sense of self.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.871
I find that exciting, Claire.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.271
It's a nice idea, Michelle,

39:14.360 --> 39:17.238
but it's also a crazy one.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.276
Claire, I want you
to listen to me.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.830
You have an amazing product.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.679
You make a mind-blowing brownie.
Okay.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.918
And I can sell anything I believe in,
and I believe in your product.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.670
We can be partners.
Not my assistant. Fifty-fifty.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.639
That's how much I believe in this.
What do you say?

39:39.320 --> 39:41.072
I have to keep
my job, Michelle.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.952
This is...
It's just too risky.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.239
(SIGHS) Come on.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.791
You don't even
like your job, Mom.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.591
Oh, that was
beautiful timing.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.829
I didn't even set that up.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.756
You know what, Claire?
Keep your terrible job.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.637
Do this on the side.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.039
Okay? Plus,
it's gonna get me off your couch.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.155
I'm in.

40:01.640 --> 40:02.680
You're in?
CLAIRE: Mmm-hmm.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.229
Let's do it, people!

40:04.320 --> 40:06.276
Okay, Rachel,
you go get dressed.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.736
I'm gonna take you to school.
We're gonna get some new recruits!

40:08.760 --> 40:11.115
(YAWNS) It's 4:00 a.m.
I'm going back to bed.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.315
Night, sweetie.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.674
What? Okay, you know what?

40:13.760 --> 40:15.796
You get your rest,
you're gonna need it!

40:15.880 --> 40:18.394
We gotta recruit some
Darnell Darlings today!

40:18.520 --> 40:20.317
Claire, my quarterback,

40:20.400 --> 40:22.152
I need you to bust
ass into that kitchen

40:22.240 --> 40:24.834
and start making pan after
pan after pan of brownies,

40:24.920 --> 40:27.070
'cause that's how fast
I'm gonna sell 'em, okay?

40:27.160 --> 40:28.991
Right now?
Right now! All right?

40:29.080 --> 40:31.071
I may have tried to
preheat that oven,

40:31.240 --> 40:33.231
so I think there's
a little bit of a gas leak.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.760
Huh? If you think
about it, it may be

40:34.840 --> 40:36.336
why you guys are
feeling a little logy.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.511
Hey, Rach, you know what?
Don't go to sleep! Don't go to sleep!

40:39.600 --> 40:40.600
Oh, my God!

40:41.520 --> 40:43.590
MICHELLE: Okay. We may
have to walk her.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.028
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

40:47.160 --> 40:48.434
Ah. You know what?

40:48.520 --> 40:51.512
It feels good to kind of put the
shine and polish back on again.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.430
People say it doesn't
matter, but it does.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.800
Puts a little kick in your step.
(MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING)

40:59.800 --> 41:01.279
Who is that beast?

41:01.760 --> 41:03.796
That's Chrystal Delveccio.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.030
She's always
getting into fist fights.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.556
Later, Dad.
MICHELLE: That's perfect.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.880
That is exactly the kind
of gal we want to recruit.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.473
You know what?
Another little tip.

41:12.560 --> 41:15.120
Look for girls that are named
after precious stones.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.959
Topaz, Sapphire,
Opal, Amber.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.440
They're all gonna
spiral down.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.239
We want to get 'em when they're
angry and fresh going in.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.595
Why don't you check out
Chrystal's availability?

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
Got it.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.236
My mom never lets
me drink coffee.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.311
Really, why?

41:33.800 --> 41:35.313
She says it'll
stunt your growth.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.118
That's not true.
That's crazy.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.510
What, do you wanna
be freakishly tall?

41:39.720 --> 41:41.073
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

41:41.840 --> 41:44.354
All right. Get in there,
drum up some good recruits.

41:45.080 --> 41:47.071
(GASPS) I feel kind of
sweaty and scared.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.056
That's just the coffee kickin' in.
It's good for...

41:49.080 --> 41:51.913
Oh, you know what?
Wait a minute, let me see something.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.033
Oh, I may have
switched them.

41:55.120 --> 41:57.588
This one's yours. I put a little
splash of bourbon in mine.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.829
That's okay.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.908
It's kind of
a secret weapon.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.118
It's what makes
the Irish so mean.

42:03.240 --> 42:04.798
And I can say that
'cause I'm Scottish!

42:05.600 --> 42:06.749
Go get 'em!

42:08.320 --> 42:11.869
SANDY: And so, due to some
unforeseen complications,

42:11.960 --> 42:13.791

42:14.240 --> 42:15.434

42:15.520 --> 42:17.590

away last night.

Listen up,
motherfuckers!

42:19.320 --> 42:20.355
Michelle, language!

42:20.440 --> 42:21.873
Who here wants
to hear about

42:21.960 --> 42:24.030
an un-freaking-believably
exciting opportunity?

42:24.280 --> 42:25.280
Huh?

42:25.800 --> 42:27.597
All right! Woo!
Look at this group!

42:28.520 --> 42:30.351
All right. What's with
all the long faces?

42:30.440 --> 42:31.714
Did somebody die?
(CHUCKLING)

42:31.800 --> 42:34.633
Yeah. Spaghetti
died last night.

42:34.720 --> 42:35.948
Who is Spaghetti?

42:36.040 --> 42:37.234
The cat.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.311
The cat? Oh.
Can I be honest?

42:39.400 --> 42:40.640
That cat probably
killed himself

42:40.680 --> 42:41.936
because his name
was "Spaghetti."

42:41.960 --> 42:42.960
Right? Hey-oh!

42:43.000 --> 42:44.149
Michelle.
MICHELLE: Oh...

42:44.960 --> 42:47.394
All right, okay.
Why don't you take off, Sandy?

42:47.480 --> 42:48.674
It's my meeting
and I'm...

42:48.800 --> 42:50.074
Okay.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.639
Go catch it. Go catch it.

42:51.720 --> 42:53.039
Really sorry
about your loss.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.749
MICHELLE: As you already know,
my name is Michelle Darnell

42:55.840 --> 42:56.840
and this is my partner.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.111
And by "partner," I don't mean like
girl-on-girl kind of stuff.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.470
Whoa!
What's "girl-on-girl stuff"?

43:03.160 --> 43:05.355
Uh, well, great question.
I love an inquisitive mind.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.510
Girl-on-girl stuff is
really just referring to

43:07.600 --> 43:10.114
something you're probably
gonna dabble with in college,

43:10.200 --> 43:11.296
but not stick
with, you know?

43:11.320 --> 43:12.456
Let's not...
Don't tell her that.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.549
Unless you're Hannah.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.016
Hannah, you're gonna stick with it.
(GIGGLING)

43:15.040 --> 43:16.096
Don't... You know
what? Let's...

43:16.120 --> 43:18.634
And I got a hunch that your
mom should've stuck with it.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.358
She wouldn't be so
pent-up and angry.

43:20.680 --> 43:21.720
MICHELLE: That's my hunch.

43:21.760 --> 43:22.896
CLAIRE: Let's change
the subject.

43:22.920 --> 43:26.799
We brought you guys some delicious
homemade brownie treats.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.838
Ooh. Look at this!
We brought treats, everybody! Treats!

43:29.960 --> 43:31.598
Let me ask you
one question.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.069
When you sell a box of cookies,
what do you get?

43:34.160 --> 43:36.993
You get points that can
apply to your canoe trip.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.548
Wrong, you get
a big plate of bullshit!

43:40.080 --> 43:42.913
That is 100% right,
you beautiful giant!

43:43.000 --> 43:45.468
Now, at Darnell's Darlings,
we don't think that's right.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.989
We think if you go out
and sell a box of cookies,

43:48.080 --> 43:49.593
we should give
you 5% commission.

43:49.880 --> 43:51.916
5% commission,
every box you sell.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.592
It was supposed
to be 10%, I think.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.592
That's right, we did say that.
Yeah.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.955
So far, you suck at this.
Just letting you know that.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.712
Okay, it's 10%.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.360
You come work with us,
you get a share of the profits.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.154
Okay. Or you can stay here!

44:04.240 --> 44:05.840
Be my guest and,
I don't know, build some

44:05.880 --> 44:08.189
dirty badger nests
in some kind of tree.

44:08.280 --> 44:10.077
Or what did you
have planned, Sandy?

44:10.560 --> 44:13.996
Well, actually, we were gonna build
a dirty badger nest in a tree.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.638
My God.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.756
My God! And I was
making that up.

44:18.840 --> 44:22.833
I was trying to think of the worst
possible scenario on Earth.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.638
What the hell is
going on in here?

44:24.920 --> 44:27.229
I leave the room for one minute
to talk to my landscaper

44:27.320 --> 44:28.833
and the meeting
goes into the toilet?

44:29.080 --> 44:30.513
Sorry, Helen,
we're almost done.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.433
Okay, you guys, the best part
about Darnell's Darlings

44:33.520 --> 44:36.432
is that, for each
box sold, an extra 10%

44:36.520 --> 44:38.636
will go into a college fund for you.
Okay?

44:38.760 --> 44:41.672
We are gonna help you save
for your college education.

44:41.760 --> 44:45.719
Wait, are you trying to poach
girls from a Dandelions meeting?

44:45.960 --> 44:47.518
No!

44:47.600 --> 44:50.512
Helen, we are not
trying to poach girls.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.673
We are actively and definitely
poaching girls from this meeting.

44:54.760 --> 44:55.856
HELEN: Get your hands off me.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.313
Fuck you, Helen!
You fuck you!

44:58.160 --> 44:59.593
Tell your little
shitty daughter,

44:59.680 --> 45:01.989
never talk to
Rachel like that again.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.116
Let's um, go, girls.
MICHELLE: Okay, girls!

45:04.360 --> 45:07.033

fun room, come on with me!

the better room. We got foosball!

it, anyway?

45:18.840 --> 45:23.789

somebody doesn't want to buy?

46:13.040 --> 46:14.598
"Buy my brownies
or I'll kill you."

that, Chrystal.

anymore freebies, okay?

Hey, Chrystal!
I'm coming for you!

50:09.000 --> 50:10.228
Bring it on!

50:19.760 --> 50:21.910
Oh, no, you don't!
You're not going anywhere!

50:22.000 --> 50:24.256
Do you understand me?
Dandelions never leave a street fight!

50:24.280 --> 50:25.554
God damn it, Helen!

50:25.640 --> 50:26.868
We're gonna wipe the floor!

50:29.960 --> 50:31.439
Sandy, why?

50:31.520 --> 50:33.431
'Cause I'm
the leader, dang it!

50:33.560 --> 50:34.993
You're a traitor!
SANDY: No.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.519
Move! That bitch is mine!

50:38.600 --> 50:39.715
Wait. No!

50:39.800 --> 50:43.190
Hey, time to put the cookies
back in the cookie jar, Helen!

50:43.280 --> 50:45.589
BOTH: Ooh. I warned you, Helen!
I warned you!

50:45.800 --> 50:47.472
Those clusters
are scratching me!

50:47.560 --> 50:49.630
Good! Darlings!

50:50.160 --> 50:51.275
Let's go!

50:52.560 --> 50:53.788
Stay down!

50:53.880 --> 50:55.518
Don't tell your mom.
Okay.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.631
(PANTING)
This was great.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.520
Ooh!

51:05.640 --> 51:07.278
That batch is burnt!

51:09.440 --> 51:10.509
Bye.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.513
One of 'em's in me.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.835
MICHELLE: Hi, is
there a Claire here?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.228
Is Claire...

51:23.680 --> 51:25.318
Hi! Where is Claire?

51:25.400 --> 51:27.868
Section 509,
but return on investment...

51:27.960 --> 51:28.960
Ugh, ugh.

51:29.480 --> 51:30.674
Oh.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.936
Look at you, in the middle of everything...
I'll call you back.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.960
In a bullpen.

51:34.040 --> 51:35.155
What are you doing here?

51:35.720 --> 51:37.995
We're out of brownies.
We need you to make more.

51:38.360 --> 51:39.713
Well, I'm at work!

51:40.200 --> 51:42.760
Uh, hi, there!
Hey! You're Michelle Darnell.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.713
Of course I am.
(LAUGHS) Yes, you are.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.711
Mike, this is Michelle.
Michelle, Mike.

51:46.880 --> 51:48.029
(INHALES DEEPLY)

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
Ah...

51:49.680 --> 51:51.033
"Mike" Mike.

51:52.280 --> 51:53.395
Oh. Rejected Mike.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.198
The rejected Mike?
Don't...

51:55.280 --> 51:58.317
You know, he is kind of cute.
I think you should toss him a pity date.

51:58.400 --> 51:59.753
MIKE: I don't need the pity,

51:59.840 --> 52:01.956
but I will take the date
if that's out there.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.109
If that's an option.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.589
Pity's all you've got.
Pity's your best friend.

52:05.880 --> 52:07.552
Okay. Good to know.
Okay.

52:07.640 --> 52:09.496
Just stop talking to him, okay?
Leave him alone.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.033
DANA: What is
going on here?

52:11.360 --> 52:13.590
(STAMMERING) Oh, my...
Greatest. Okay.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.792
You are Michelle Darnell.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.074
Guilty as charged.

52:17.200 --> 52:20.158
Oh, wow. I have
two personal heroes in my life,

52:20.280 --> 52:22.396
and I am staring at
one of them right now.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.955
Oh, no. No touching.
No.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.276
Curious to know
who the other one is.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.669
It's Benedict Cumberbatch,
and you.

52:30.240 --> 52:33.596
Huh. I did not peg you
for a "Cumbersnatch."

52:33.920 --> 52:35.592
That's me. Cumbersnatch.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.033
You seem like
a real Cumbersnatch.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.917
Well, thank you so,
so much.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.069
You're welcome. Oh...

52:40.680 --> 52:42.238
Thank you.
Great encounter.

52:42.320 --> 52:45.756
It's always fun.
And I think I'm done with you.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.629
Absolutely.
And, madam, it was an honor.

52:49.720 --> 52:51.790
Off you go!
And here I am, okay.

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
MICHELLE: Strange girl.

52:56.480 --> 52:57.595
Okay.

52:58.400 --> 53:02.154
Claire, if this company is going to work,
I need you full time.

53:02.280 --> 53:03.793
I can't have you here.

53:04.480 --> 53:06.198
Are you in or are you out?

53:06.280 --> 53:08.191
I can't just leave my job!

53:08.280 --> 53:10.316
I mean, I have to
have a steady income.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.753
I have Rachel
to think about.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.229
No, no, no.
This is for Rachel. Okay?

53:14.320 --> 53:16.914
If this works out the way I
know it's going to work out,

53:17.000 --> 53:18.592
it's gonna set
you two up for life.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.336
We're already
making enough money

53:20.360 --> 53:22.032
to pay your rent
and all your bills,

53:22.120 --> 53:25.749
and I'm just about to put a very big
fish on the hook as our investor.

53:25.840 --> 53:26.989
This is what I do.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.638
Okay? You know that.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.998
You have to trust me.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.032
I do hate this job.

53:34.680 --> 53:36.511
I mean, it's a terrible job.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.316
My God. I mean,
look at him.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.274
He's slumped over, asleep.
I hope he's asleep.

53:42.360 --> 53:44.032
You don't want
to be that guy.

53:44.800 --> 53:45.994
What do you say?

53:47.720 --> 53:48.789
Okay.

53:48.880 --> 53:50.711
Yes. I'm all in.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.392
Dana, I quit.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.591
I'm gonna start my
own business, okay?

53:54.680 --> 53:56.830
I have my own business.
Yes, she does.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.757
Guys, it was lovely here.

53:58.880 --> 54:01.348
Not really, but I hope you all
have a wonderful day.

54:01.440 --> 54:03.635
Mike, would you still
like to go on that date?

54:03.760 --> 54:04.829
Uh, yes, I would.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.309
I'm free tomorrow at 7:30.
Bring your A-game.

54:08.040 --> 54:10.634
Tracy? Wake up! I'm out!

54:10.720 --> 54:12.392
MICHELLE: Wake it up, Tracy!

54:12.480 --> 54:13.515
No.
No.

54:13.600 --> 54:14.794
No, thank you.
I'm so...

54:15.000 --> 54:17.116
Ooh. No.
I'm very flattered.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.957
Seems like a good night for
sexual activity, Claire.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.160
(CHUCKLES)

54:23.280 --> 54:26.317
How long has it been since
you've had sexual activity?

54:27.320 --> 54:31.199
Stop yelling "sexual activity."
'Cause Rachel might hear you.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.478
You know, you're
the one that's yelling

54:34.600 --> 54:36.238
"sexual activity"
out in the hallway.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.272
Just answer
the question, Claire.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.509
I don't know.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.352
If I had to guess,

54:41.680 --> 54:44.592
maybe four, five,
six years?

54:45.320 --> 54:47.880
What? Oh, my God.
Did you take a vow?

54:47.960 --> 54:50.190
It's very hard to
find a good sitter.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.790
Okay. We'll go
with that. I just...

54:52.880 --> 54:54.677
I'm gonna say,
it probably doesn't help

54:54.760 --> 54:57.479
that you're dressed like
you grocery-shop at a CVS.

54:58.120 --> 54:59.120
What?

54:59.200 --> 55:00.553
I love this sweater.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.233
I don't know
why you would.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.396
This sweater goes with everything.
It's a neutral.

55:04.520 --> 55:07.876
It doesn't go with you or your skin,
or your face.

55:08.120 --> 55:10.793
That sweater is the equivalent
of a sandwich board

55:10.880 --> 55:12.632
that just says,
"I give up."

55:12.720 --> 55:15.314
And then in the back,
it says, "I never started tryin'."

55:16.120 --> 55:17.712
It somewhat
looks like you have

55:17.800 --> 55:22.590
sewn together two very long,
sad tube socks and then filled each end

55:23.000 --> 55:25.958
with wet sand and rocks.

55:26.040 --> 55:27.439
What are you
talking about?

55:27.520 --> 55:29.158
It just looks like
two basset hounds

55:29.280 --> 55:30.918
may have cried
themselves to death

55:31.000 --> 55:32.433
in your sweater.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.909
I like it.
I think this looks great.

55:35.600 --> 55:36.669
Can I...
(GASPS)

55:36.760 --> 55:38.079
Michelle!
Well...

55:38.160 --> 55:39.275
You are...
I had to check.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.600
I didn't know
what was in there.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.856
You're making me feel very
insecure right before my date.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.949
Don't!

55:44.040 --> 55:46.315
If your breasts
could speak right now,

55:46.400 --> 55:48.595
I think they'd be
saying, "Claire,

55:48.760 --> 55:50.876
"please don't zip me
up in your jeans."

55:51.000 --> 55:52.376
That is...
You're gonna zip a nipple.

55:52.400 --> 55:53.594
That's not what
they'd say.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.591
May I adjust your strap?

55:55.720 --> 55:57.676
'Cause I'm trying to help you, Claire.
(SIGHS)

55:57.760 --> 55:59.736
You say, "Be more helpful."
And I'm trying to be helpful.

55:59.760 --> 56:00.829
You can tighten
the strap.

56:00.960 --> 56:02.632
Okay. What...

56:02.720 --> 56:04.358
Just a little,
'cause I want it...

56:04.440 --> 56:05.634
What is that toggle?

56:06.600 --> 56:07.919
Oh, it's a nursing bra.

56:08.560 --> 56:10.755
Oh, my God.
Are you still nursing Rachel?

56:10.840 --> 56:14.230
No, it's from when she was a baby.
But it's very comfortable.

56:14.440 --> 56:16.431
That's not
comfortable to see.

56:16.560 --> 56:17.913
Now, let me see this.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.468
It's very often a fit issue.
(EXHALES)

56:21.120 --> 56:22.348
Why do these
have so much pull?

56:22.520 --> 56:23.714
All right, well...
(GASPS)

56:23.800 --> 56:26.553
Claire! It's
like Geppetto!

56:26.640 --> 56:28.870
Look at that. Look at this.
It's like, "Horses, horses."

56:28.960 --> 56:30.040
It's like I'm...
Oh, my God.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.712
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay!

56:31.800 --> 56:33.392
It feels good.
I need to be comfortable.

56:33.480 --> 56:35.391
It doesn't feel
good to my eyes.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.176
Can I just put 'em
where they're supposed to be?

56:37.200 --> 56:39.395
And I want you to be able
to see the difference.

56:39.480 --> 56:42.711
You got "Happy girl",
and then, uh-oh.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.155
They just drop out.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.950
And I should not be
able to separate...

56:47.040 --> 56:48.176
Okay. All right.
They're heavier, but...

56:48.200 --> 56:50.296
So how do you like it when I just
get in there and bang around?

56:50.320 --> 56:51.833
I love it.
Why is there not...

56:52.120 --> 56:53.189
Oh, there's no give.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.475
Look at that.
I can't even feel that.

56:55.560 --> 56:56.629
That's when
you know...

56:59.320 --> 57:01.550
I don't feel it, okay?
100% silicone.

57:01.640 --> 57:04.473
And not the kind that's supposed
to ever be inside the body.

57:04.600 --> 57:06.192
(SNORTING)
I know. They're fantastic.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.349
That's something else.

57:07.440 --> 57:08.475
Might feel that.

57:08.560 --> 57:09.709
That's my nipple.

57:10.440 --> 57:12.576
Yeah, they're up here,
where they should be. Oh, my God.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.079
No, see, you need
to bring 'em down.

57:14.200 --> 57:15.758
No! They can't,
anyway, no.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.976
That's what you need to do.
They're too high, Michelle.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.319
There's a structure. Stop.
No.

57:19.400 --> 57:20.515
If we were...
You need to...

57:20.560 --> 57:22.496
Look, just take 'em a little bit lower.
Oh, my God.

57:22.520 --> 57:23.736
How about that?
I paid a fortune for these.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.016
No, I'm gonna bring 'em...
I'm keepin' 'em up!

57:25.040 --> 57:26.096
Just gonna push
'em right down.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.176
I'm trying to
help you not...

57:27.200 --> 57:28.758
What're you guys doing?

57:28.960 --> 57:30.234
Hey, there!

57:30.320 --> 57:33.551
We're just... There was a...
Probably a...

57:33.640 --> 57:34.709
I was...
Bugs.

57:34.800 --> 57:38.839
We were jostling
each other's bosoms like...

57:39.120 --> 57:40.189
Gals do.

57:40.280 --> 57:41.793
No, we weren't.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.872
I was just trying to help your mom
here get ready for her big date.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.468
I'm a little nervous.
She's a little bit nervous.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.393
Always gotta stretch your
boobs when you're nervous.

57:51.640 --> 57:52.680
RACHEL: You should change.

57:53.040 --> 57:55.190
That's your
TV-watching sweater.

57:55.800 --> 57:56.994
Thank you.

57:57.680 --> 57:59.796
Okay. Thank you for that.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.598
Okay, well, we're
gonna leave you to it.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.136
You can treat yourself
to a little underwire

58:03.160 --> 58:05.296
and something that doesn't
look like you sell ceramics.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.276
Let's go watch a movie.
I'm babysitting.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.396
Have you seen <i>Texas
Chainsaw Massacre?</i> No.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.238
I'm kidding!
I'm not kidding.

58:14.200 --> 58:16.270
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

58:19.080 --> 58:20.195
(SIGHS)

58:24.040 --> 58:25.234
Hi.

58:25.400 --> 58:28.631
Hi. Oh, my God.
You look gorgeous.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.836
I'm wearing a bra,
a new bra. It's not new.

58:30.920 --> 58:32.831
It's old. I just haven't
worn it in a while.

58:32.920 --> 58:35.912
Hey, you know what,
I went with an old bra tonight, too, so...

58:36.880 --> 58:37.949
Let's get a table.

58:38.080 --> 58:39.229
Absolutely.

58:40.760 --> 58:44.070
I wanted to tell you earlier actually,
on a serious note.

58:44.720 --> 58:47.075
When you walked out the
other day from work,

58:47.160 --> 58:48.991
quite dramatically,
I might add,

58:49.080 --> 58:50.433
six other people quit.

58:50.880 --> 58:52.677
What?
Mmm-hmm. They just walked out.

58:52.760 --> 58:54.478
Oh, my God.
I know, right?

58:54.600 --> 58:55.794
I started a chain reaction.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.200
You started
a huge chain reaction.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.434
Six people walked out

58:58.520 --> 59:00.136
and then immediately three
people walked back inside.

59:00.160 --> 59:01.480
I think they were
outside smoking.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.318
But it was like you
were a cult leader.

59:03.440 --> 59:05.040
It was like a tremendous
show of support.

59:05.120 --> 59:07.634
It was, like,
very inspiring.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.031
Really?
Yeah, really.

59:10.480 --> 59:11.833
Do you find that
hard to believe?

59:11.960 --> 59:14.679
That I'm tremendously inspiring?
Yeah.

59:14.760 --> 59:16.193
Yeah, a bit.
Really?

59:16.320 --> 59:17.878
Well, let me tell
you something, lady.

59:17.960 --> 59:20.315
You are more than
a little inspiring.

59:22.840 --> 59:25.070
I have been talking
ad nauseam here.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.395
Can you, uh, grab
the mic for a sec?

59:28.400 --> 59:30.277
Well, I, um...

59:30.360 --> 59:32.999
I got knocked up in
grad school by my TA.

59:33.080 --> 59:34.336
When he found
out I was pregnant,

59:34.360 --> 59:36.080
he pretended like we
didn't know each other.

59:36.160 --> 59:37.957
What?
Then gave me a "D."

59:38.040 --> 59:39.393
What?
Yeah, nice surprise.

59:39.480 --> 59:40.515
Yeah.

59:40.600 --> 59:42.397
But I got a great
kid out of it.

59:42.760 --> 59:43.909
I bet you're a great mom.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.189
I try.

59:45.280 --> 59:47.976
I mean, unless she is currently
unsupervised. Then you're a horrible mom.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.752
No, she's with Michelle.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.432
She's with Michelle?
Yes.

59:51.520 --> 59:53.112
She's your felon babysitter.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.349
(LAUGHING)
Oh! Oh, my God!

59:56.440 --> 59:58.510
Rachel,
it's the goriest part!

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.795
It's the goriest part.
You're missing it!

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.190
Oh, my God.
He's killing her with a chainsaw.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.395
Oh.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.910
I have a felon
watching my child.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.256
That just occurred
to you, didn't it?

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.508
Yes, it did.
Yeah.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.640
It's good thing I'm here.
Let's have some more wine.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.070
Absolutely, yeah.
Hey, excuse me.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.193
Hi. Do you think maybe we could get
two more glasses of the...

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.513
No. Hold on.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.276
Bring us a bottle of
whatever the lady would like

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.113
in the twenty-five to
twenty-eight dollar range.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.480
Sure, I'll send somebody to Walgreens
to get you something nice.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.949
Cool. You guys do that?
What's with that?

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.314
(LAUGHING)
Oh, my God!

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.191
Is that like a really
cheap bottle of wine?

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.193
IDA: You got a lot of balls
showing up here, Darnell.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.111
Listen, Ida, I know you're still mad at me,
and I don't blame you.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.200
I shouldn't have cut you
out of that Emerson deal.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.157
But if it makes it
any better,

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.470
I made a blinding amount
of money on that deal.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.434
You know the first time I saw you?
Twenty-three years old.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.511
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
I knew right away,

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.791
you were a tough,
money-hungry,

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.872
self-serving,
see-you-next-Tuesday gal

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.313
just like me.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.598
And that's why I decided to mentor you.
Just let you get too close.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.709
I started to think
of you as family.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.749
Well, families are
for suckers, right?

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.754
That's for sure.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.671
What do you
want, Michelle?

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.352
I need an investor.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.717
Oh, for your little
brownie venture?

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.317
How do you even
know about that?

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.956
Because I'm Ida Marquette.
I know everything.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600
Here.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.954
Come on, Ida.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.256
I'm sure you got quite an overhead
on this glue factory here.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.430
Do you want in or not?
You know,

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.350
I once made love
on a pool table

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.431
in Hot Coffee,
Mississippi

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.433
with six members of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.909
Are you stroking out?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.274
What does this
have to do with

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.316
what we're talking
about right now?

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.717
The point is, Darnell,
I have very few regrets in my life.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.597
But you...
You were my best protégée.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680
Tell you what.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.878
I'll back you, if this checks out.
Just for old times' sake.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.195
Okay.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.793
If you'll
excuse me, Shawshank,

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.191
I'm late for
my morning ride.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.429
IDA: Yes!

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.549
Okay.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.312
You better make me
a shitload of money.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.879
Away, Butters!

MICHELLE: Come on!
Eat up, ladies.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.879
This is a celebratory dinner.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.598
We got our investor.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.398
Okay. Here we go.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.834
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.029
Look at this!

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.509
What is this?

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.672
Well, I feel it's time you
become more adventurous.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.192
I know you
don't like sushi.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.157
Thank you, Michelle!
I'm starving.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.551
And fugu for the lady.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.951
MICHELLE: Thank you, Ping.
Fugu?

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.595
(EXHALES)

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.714
The infamous pufferfish.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.913
When prepared incorrectly,
it can lead to paralysis or even death.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.256
But when it is
prepared correctly,

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.238
it is like a volcano
erupting in my mouth.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.912
Let's hope for
the second. (SLURPING)

Oh, this is nice.
Get in here, guys.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.599
I don't wanna
hog it all.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.475
Michelle, are you all right?

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.794
When it's this perfect,
it takes you to the brink of paralysis.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.713
And then, at the last minute,
it just lets you go.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.356
Three, two...

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.195

MICHELLE: Whoo.
That's a very risky dish.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.431
Oh, God.
How long was I out?

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.118
Are you serious?
Like 10 seconds.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.635
Yeah.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.519
It's a personal best.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.239
I was thinking
about having more.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.416
CLAIRE: All right,
I think everybody's done with the fugu.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.510
I'm gonna tea it out, just for a second.
Yeah.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.953
I made you something.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.075
What?

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.549
I mean, I thought I
should give it to you now

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.428
'cause you keep eating
things that almost kill you.

at school.

It's a nice frame, Rachel.
You did a good job.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.189
Thanks.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.159
When I look at the picture,
I just think we're like a weird family.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.955
Okay. Ah.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.276
Family? That's
a little heavy-handed.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.073
I think, you know,
I'm not much into labeling.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.796
You say "family",
and we don't look alike.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.509
I mean, I'm not even sure
that you two look alike.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.512
We'll have to do a blood
test on you for that.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.872
You know, it's funny, looking at this,
I think what day is this?

'Cause I'm pretty
sure I have a...

I have a previously
scheduled thing.

I was... You know.

Do what you do.
I'm gonna do what I do.

I'll take care of
the check.

I just...

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.108
What was that about?

(SIGHS) I don't know,
sweetie. I don't know.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.432
Hi! Sorry, baby.
Michelle was supposed to pick you up.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.399
I know. I texted her
like 500,000 times.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.233

stuff is gone.

That's impersonal.

A bit.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.755

her that picture of us.

Sweetie, she
loved your picture.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.231
No, come on. She left because
it was her time to leave.

Michelle is a redhead
and a Scorpio.

have realized it as well...

screws you over.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.679
This is Chrystal.
It's one of the Darnell originals.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.432
She's a giant. Huh?

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.350
I mean, I'm not a doctor,
but I have eyes.

I know you're not shy.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.835
It's a phoenix, Claire.
It's my totem animal.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.118
Okay. So you leased a commercial
kitchen without telling me?

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.839
Yes. I'm kind of waiting for a,
"Thank you, Michelle!"

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.149
Wow, um. I'm having a hard time
with the "thank you"

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.915
because you also hired all of these
people without consulting me.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.231
I do know that you've been
complaining pretty consistently

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.754
about having to do all the baking
and doing it at your house.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.875
I fixed all that for ya.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.120
And you're more
mad than ever.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.536
I don't get it, Claire.
You didn't...

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.073
Michelle, you didn't consult
me on any of this, okay?

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.428
I see a bunch of press.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.953
One of us, not you,
got the press here.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.080
Right. Okay.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.599
Well, maybe they
should know that

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.198
the new and
improved Michelle Darnell

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:56.397
is just as self-centered and egotistical
as the old Michelle Darnell.

Sure!

No, not from the front.
From the back! Yes!

me what to do!

You're not my
boss anymore!

We are partners, 50-50,

without telling me!

talking about?

God, I can't believe
I helped you!

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.835
I took you in
off the street, okay?

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.148
When no one else would.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.037

Okay? You're
getting close to people

to push them away.

No! No! You do not tell
my daughter what to do.

Don't ever speak to her again.

you say that?

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.674
And I'll do it.
(CHUCKLES)

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.234
To pledge my allegiance to you,
milady, I'll do it.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.833
No. Thank you.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.433
Ooh, you guys
are kissing.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.229
Heya, Rachel! Hi. How are you?
Hi.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.311
Did you sleep over?
CLAIRE: Oh, God, no.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.913
What, have
a sleepover here? Ew.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.176
No, he didn't. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Yuck!
No, that would be terrible.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.235
I don't know
about "yuck".

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.496
I don't mean "yuck."
I meant...

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.320
CLAIRE: Don't know if it'll...
MIKE: I mean...

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.157
It could be nice.
Might be nice.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.416
It's nice for people to spend the night.
We don't know yet.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.317
We don't know yet.
We don't know yet.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.155
Would you please grab
some more garbage bags?

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.719
We have a
lot of trash.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.915
Yeah.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.718
Why did I make
that so weird?

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.949
It's fine.
Didn't have to.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.680
Didn't have to
make it that weird. (GASPS)

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.515
Holy shit!
CLAIRE: Language!

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.479
Holy shit!

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.868
Uh...

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.392
This is all seeming
probably so much

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.398
stranger than
what I had intended.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.313
I'm sorry to
startle you, Rachel.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.516
What are you
doing in my closet?

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.114
Well, uh, to give
you the whole...

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.919
I thought I have
a great idea

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.072
to surprise you
with an apology,

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.594
and my sincere
"I'm sorry."

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.036
So I let myself in,
in the middle of the night.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.469
So once I was actually
waiting here in the dark,

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.154
and you were getting up for the morning,
I thought, "Uh-oh.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.834
"This could seem kind of
threatening and menacing."

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.632
And I panicked
a little bit

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.678
and just darted
into the closet.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.353
So, surprise! I'm sorry.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.910
And, dang it,
I shouldn't have sold that company.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.957
I think we're done.
Okay, well...

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.476
You know... So thank you, I guess,
for breaking into my home.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.959
I said I was sorry.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.076
Great.
We heard you. Okay.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.991
I apologized.
I heard you.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.719
There's the door.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.559
You sold us out.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.675
Yeah, I did.

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.278
I sold you out.
And I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.990
And I'm hoping, somehow,
you can forgive me.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.718
And I just wanna
throw it out there

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.150
that I have completely
forgiven you, Claire,

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.994
for trying to sell me out
first with Renault so...

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.716
What are you
talking about?

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:54.835
I saw you.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.154
Okay? I saw you and Ronald
outside the bakery.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.593
He was smelling
your hand

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:03.029
and I know what that means, okay?
(SCOFFS)

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.197
I mean, he has smelled
many of my parts,

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.550
and I have smelled
many of his parts.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.753
I was telling Renault
that I'm not willing

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.718
to sell him a single,
solitary brownie,

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.756
let alone my
entire company.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.759
(STAMMERING)

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.876
That's a mix-up, huh?

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.756
Michelle, I would never in a million
years do that to you, okay?

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.912
You know... I mean, God.
What goes on in your brain?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.115
I don't know.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.830
I mean,
I don't have a lot of,

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.831
you know, experience
or a reference point for...

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.037
I didn't have a family,
or a mom, or a dad.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.352
And I totally get it
if you never talk to me again.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.479
So I don't want you
to feel bad about that.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.632
I just wanted you to know that I
think you're very nice people.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.310
Great people, actually.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.393
You're the closest thing
to a family I've ever had.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:07.270
And I'm real sorry
I screwed that up.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.592
I'm gonna miss you, Michelle.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.880
MIKE: Should I go?

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.390
I think I should go.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.816
Oh, my God.
It's an awkward time for me

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.576
to just be, like, creeping
around in the background.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.477
I had no idea you
were still here.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.256
Should I go, or should I...
No, you're fine.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.713
I do not like
what you did.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:31.274
I do not like it!
And I do not like it.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.030
She really
doesn't like it, guys.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:36.920
You know, I...

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:42.191
If anyone's curious,
I do think I know how to fix this.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.953
I signed that contract with
Renault late Friday night.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.032
I wanna remind you I was wounded,
I was a little tipsy.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.678
CLAIRE: Oh, God.
Okay.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.391
And it's Sunday.
No one will be in his offices.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.869
Plus, he can't file for a
corporate change of ownership

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.837
until tomorrow morning.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.274
I can get in there tonight,

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.477
I can get that contract,
and I can take our company back.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.216
Wait, what do you
mean "get the contract"?

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.595
He must have scanned and emailed
it a hundred times by now.

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.319
No, no, no. Anybody else,
yes, but not him.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.597
Ronald is completely paranoid
about being hacked. Okay?

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.196
He has no cell phones, no emails.
He leaves no digital trail.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.555
Claire knows this.
He's all old-school pen and paper.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.039
It's the samurai way.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.318
Okay, I'm in.
Let's do this. I'm in.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.628
CLAIRE: Why would you be in?

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.216
MIKE: What do you mean
why would I be in?

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.296
You've been talking
all morning about

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.072
how you wanted to
get your company back.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.913
And you guys are gonna need help,
and I'm a helpful guy.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.319
How's that for a reason?

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.240
You're gonna get
rewarded for that.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.396
MIKE: Well, that's
not why I did it.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.916
I'm in, too.
MICHELLE: No, Claire.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.070
This is my fault
and I'm gonna fix it.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.991
Michelle, this is my decision.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.513
And I want our
company back.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.079
Yes, Claire.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.037
All right, let's
fuck this shit up.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.270
Language.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.553
I need to get a sitter.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.468
Yeah, you do.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.080
MICHELLE: As soon as we get out I
want you to grab the gasoline,

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.473
some rags,
and torch the van.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:04.696
MIKE: What are you
talking about?

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.216
I rented the van.
It's on my credit card.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.468
You go down,
you go down alone.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.198
How would we
even get home?

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.077
That's a good point.
MVP, Claire.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.596
Uh-oh. There's no door handle back here.
There's absolutely... Oh.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.638
Thank you, Claire.
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.350
Okay. I still don't
think you should be here.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.440
But if we get caught,

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.896
I want you to tell the police
that I forced you here by gun.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.096
You gotta watch out for Rachel.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.997
Okay. You don't have
a gun, though, right?

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.911
What am I, a thug?
Okay.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.594
MIKE: I'm such a badass!
This is gonna be amazing!

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.955
Also, by the way, guys,
I was googling jail sentences.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.270
Since none of us are actually armed,
minimal jail time.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.876
Oops. Just excuse me
for one minute.

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.269
(GASPS) Michelle!
Well, it's a collector's item.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:43.960
Ditch it.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.896
Chuckin' a gun in a garbage can.
That's smart.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:47.920
What?
Oh, my God.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.195
Okay! I know it was wrong.
I self-corrected.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.157
No, you didn't.
I just asked you to throw...

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.515
Well, you made me
throw it away. Okay.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.391
Okay, there it is.
Renault Enterprises.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.480
<i>The contract is probably
in his private office,</i>

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.431
<i>which is at the top
of the building.</i>

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.480
<i>I'm guessing there's a safe,
could be in the wall.</i>

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.030
<i>Could be behind
one of those creepy paintings.</i>

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.712
<i>We got two guards on tonight.</i>

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.736
<i>We got one at the main desk
and one by the elevators.</i>

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.240
<i>Mike, I need you to
distract the guard</i>

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.313
<i>while Claire lumbers in,
and I follow behind like a cougar.</i>

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.473
<i>Okay, next, we head upstairs.</i>

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.080
<i>Claire, I'm gonna
give you a head start</i>

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.395
<i>'cause I'm gonna take those
motherfuckers 10 at a time.</i>

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.040
<i>You stand there with your mouth
hangin' open, and pointin',</i>

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.912
<i>and I'll slide into home base.</i>

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.030
<i>Mike, I need you to
distract the guard</i>

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.076
<i>by coming from the east,
turning him around,</i>

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.230
<i>so when we approach,
while you're sucking his dick,</i>

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.719
<i>we can get right past him.</i>

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.193
<i>So under no circumstances...</i>

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.918
I'm sucking his what?

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.235
You're sucking his dick.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.992
I'm sucking his dick?
Oh.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.576
MICHELLE: Well, I'm not
gonna suck his dick.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.194
I'm the brains behind it.
The brains never sucks the dick.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.336
Why am I sucking his dick?
I don't wanna suck his dick!

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.396
Claire doesn't
wanna suck his dick!

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.670
How 'bout none of us
suck that man's penis?

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.239
Yeah, what if nobody
sucks his dick?

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.514
No dick suckin'.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.516
Well, I worked on
that plan a long time.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.591
Fine. Fine,
let's go to plan B.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.033
MIKE: Yeah,
that sounds good.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.918
If you're gonna be a baby and not
suck dick, that's fine with me.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.715
(GROANING)

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.352
KENNY: Hey, there.
Hey! How you doing?

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.274
Is this 9800 Michigan?
I'm late for a birthday party.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.952
No, this is 9900.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.678
This is 9900?
Yeah.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.936
Well, wouldn't you know it?
Yeah.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.120
Why are you
dressed like that?

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.315
What are you
dressed as?

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.469
I'm glad you asked me.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.472
I am actually a demon.
I'm a phoenix.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.789
(SNICKERING)

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.599
Pretty cool, right?

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.189
Are you into demons?

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.950
Yeah. I know
a fair amount.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.109
KENNY: That is very cool.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.776
MIKE: You can touch
the feathers if you want.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.155
Yeah, a lot of people don't know that.
It was a demon.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.437
It's actually
pronounced Quetzalcóatl.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.856
(WHISPERING) He's
talking too much.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.394
He'd be a lot quieter
with a penis in his mouth.

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.069
I'm into demons.
You are?

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.275
Yeah.
I think you said that.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.120
I really am. I do
a lot of fantasy role-play.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.559
That's so weird.

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.437
Yeah, gets a little
boring in here sometimes.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.158
I bet.
I whistle.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.878
You whistle?
I whistle a lot in here.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.075
Let's hear some.
Yeah.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.752
(WHISTLING)

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.238
Why is that
one whistling?

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.679
Just kind of
holding that one note.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.056
Yeah, I like to do that.
I like to play with

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.877
bars and structures,
things like that.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.800
MIKE: You got a real hefty
lung capacity there.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.393
I never got your name.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.796
Yeah, it's... It's Jim. Jimberly.
Jim?

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.912
Jimberly?
Jimberly Stevenson.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:31.799
(MIKE YELLING)

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.233
What's going on?

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.834
It's a cramp!
God, I got a cramp!

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.878
Kenny! All right. I can help you.
I can help you.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.336
It's in the quad! No, it's in the quad.
Right here? Right here?

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.839
That's the top.
That's the top.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.955
KENNY: Okay? Right there?

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.960
MIKE: That's a little too close to the
groin, Kenny. That's a no-fly zone.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.629
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.756
Thank God you're here.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.115
I'm always here.
This is my shift.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.631
(LAUGHING)

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.953
Yeah.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.554
Sorry. You are so funny.
That really got me.

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.830
I'm Pete. I'm security.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.878
Hi, Pete. I

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.598
am a specialty dancer.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.749
Whoa.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.594
"Whoa" is right.
Nice blouse.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.870
CLAIRE: It's Talbots.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.231
One of my more expensive
clients asked

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:24.312
that I pay him a visit here,
in the building, tonight.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.716
No one goes up without a pass.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320
Right.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.994
All I need you to do is swipe that
little card, okay?

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.957
And then, mama
can get to work.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.560
Sometimes, before the dance,
I have to limber up.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.358
I do some
sexy stretches. Like...

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.976
All right? How's that?
Jelly. Back to square one.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.479
We're good?
Yup! Yup, yup.

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.073
I don't wanna overdo it.
Phew.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.558
Okay. Well, hey.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.336
Kenny, you're one of the
good ones, man. Yeah.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.016
Yeah, not a lot of guys
would do that for another guy.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.712
I'll do it for you.
Thanks, man.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.656
But we'll hang. We'll do it.
Yeah, we'll totally hang.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.216
No big deal, buddy.
All right, have a good one.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.468
Bye, Jimberly.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.598
You buzz me up,

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.636
and I'll give you a free dance
on the way down.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.829
How about that?

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.554
I'll let you up.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.669
I like Gordon Lightfoot.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.068
Who doesn't?

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.516
<i>The legend lives on
from the Chippewa on down</i>

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.115
<i>To the big lake they
call Gitche Gumee</i>

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:30.953
<i>The lake... Said and...</i>
(MUMBLING)

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.395
Oh, my God.
Pete! Pete! Pete! Pete!

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.193
Did you just...

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.315
Yes.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.469
Did you?

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.389
No.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.073
God damn it, Pete.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.913
I gotta sit down.
Yeah.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.069
Okay.
I gotta sit down.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.636
I'm embarrassed.
Just...

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.189
He seems nice.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.235
Jesus.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.871
Jimberly. "J", "J".

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.709
Maybe it's "J-Y-M."

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.756
What the fuck?
There's no Jimberlys.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:14.435
(SNORING)

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.872
Well, then where
is his office?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.117
I don't know.
The last time I was here, I was tipsy.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.759
(ELEVATOR DINGING)

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.960
Oh, my God. You guys,
we're total burglars. Look at us!

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.473
How did you get
past the guards?

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.880
That was a piece of cake.
He was, like, totally passed out.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.376
I don't know what was
going on there.

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.435
Me neither.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.312
(LAUGHING)

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.951
I feel like this is
going great.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:49.510
Michelle, you brought trash bags,
baby wipes, shower gel.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.909
Do you actually think
we're gonna need rope?

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.236
Come on! Every story about a
burglar always involves rope.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.656
That's true.
It's in all the movies.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.875
I am a mogul,
not a cat burglar.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.120
I'm also the only one that
thought to bring provisions.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.512
MIKE: Michelle, stop!
I forgot, I'm sorry.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.576
I stole the guard's keycard.
What?

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.749
You stole his key?

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.040
Yeah. Okay.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.958
MIKE: Somebody loves
<i>Mortal Kombat.</i>

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.656
CLAIRE: Let's just find the
contract and get outta here.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.136
Okay. I bet you he put
it in his panic room.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.736
That's what I'd do
if I had a panic room.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.776
It's probably voice-activated,
high-tech stuff in here.

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:22.835
Open desk.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:24.558
Yeah. Open desk!
CLAIRE: Open...

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.119
No, it was just manual.

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.911
I got it! In his
desk drawer,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.831
in a file marked "Darnell."

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.150
Probably overthought that one.
It's classic Mike.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.271
MIKE: I do that a lot.
Let's go!

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.600
RENAULT: Son of a bitch,
Stephan! You left the door open!

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:41.120
Oh.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.028
Well, who do
we have here?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.788
Michelle Darnell,
the baker and Quetzalcóatl.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.070
That is impressive.
I mean, you gotta give him that.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.798
I'm not even
wearing the mask.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.432
That wouldn't be our contract
you're holding, would it, Michelle?

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.520
You wouldn't be foolish enough to
back out of our plan, would you?

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.279
You know what?
It was never her company to sell.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.318
I own 50% of it, so...
RENAULT: Yeah.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.079
I may have fudged the initial paperwork.
You what?

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.559
But I am sorry.
So, I'm not...

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:09.656
And I will rectify...
Michelle!

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.557
You will be. You will be.
I'm sorry.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.030
I wonder, how should
I approach this?

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.878
Call the proper authorities
and turn you in?

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.315
Or we could just talk it
out amongst ourselves.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.196
Do you know what the
fascinating thing is

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.356
about the Japanese
martial arts?

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.913
The discipline.

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.399
(INHALES DEEPLY) Ya!

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.793
The integrity.

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.839
The loyalty.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.433
Okay, okay, stop!

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.754
I'll do it.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.478
I'll suck your dick.
What?

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.834
MIKE: I don't wanna do it,

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.229
but if you promise not to
hurt anybody in this room,

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.554
I'll suck your dick.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.680
Mike, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.759
Oh, my God.
Mike, no. What?

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.478
You don't want me to
suck his dick? No.

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.630
Wrong dick,
wrong time, Mike.

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:02.720
Wrong dick.
Wrong dick.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.256
It was supposed to be
the security guy's dick.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.599
I was trying to
be a team player.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.830
Real eager, Claire.
It's a red flag.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.035
I don't like
sucking dicks.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.269
It's not my business.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.680
RENAULT: Nobody's
sucking my dick.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.909
CLAIRE: Fair enough.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.798
Well, that's the first time
I've heard you say that, but...

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.880
I'm going to plan B,

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.518
my tongue has
always been my sword.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.600
MIKE: Okay.

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.191
Put the knife
away, Ronald.

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:26.153
It's not a knife.
It's a katana.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.355
Katana.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.876
You're not gonna cut anyone with
that knife and we all know it.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.475
(GASPS)

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.675
MIKE: Oh, shit!

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.149
Big bird, blondie,
over there! Go! Scoot!

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.673
MIKE: Okay. All right, easy!

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.120
(GROANS)

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.275
Oh, shit.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.790
Are you crazy, Ron?
I'm bleeding!

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.479
Give me back what's mine.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.788
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.108
Michelle!

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.073
Oh, hello, old friend!
Get off!

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.149
Oh, God,
I've missed this.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.629
God, you keep
that shit tight. No!

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.120
(GRUNTING)

CLAIRE: Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.309
Michelle, get up!
Get up!

(GROANING)

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.909

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.999
MICHELLE: Okay,
let's be reasonable.

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.440
You know, I'm sure we can come
to some kind of an agreement.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.875
Oh, we're past that point.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.216
For the first time in my life,
I'm trying to do the right thing!

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.992
This is not about
me and you!

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.718
You don't even
want our company!

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.349
That's true, but you screwed me over
25 years ago, you bitch.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.911
I thought sending you
to prison would help,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.037
but cutting you to ribbons is the
only way I'll get satisfaction!

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:27.760
(GRUNTS)

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.269
Had enough?
(GRUNTING)

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280
Shit.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.631
Oh, check this out.
MICHELLE: Fucking psycho!

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920
(GRUNTING)

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440
Back up.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.359
(YELLING)

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.600
Look at that!

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.837
Just a figure eight.
It's like double Dutch!

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.955
That's not
how you do it.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.216
Yeah, looks like
I'm doing it.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.470
Look at that.
I can bob, somebody can weave.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.635
You see this shit.

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.273
Ow! God!

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.759
Huh? Twelve years
of baton.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.616
Everybody likes to make
fun of the baton girls.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.029
Seven, eight,
one, two, three, four...

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.120
(GASPING)

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.673
Just give him
the contract!

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.274
No! I'm getting
our company back!

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.234
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.115
(SCREAMS)

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.194
(EXCLAIMING) I will cut you in
your white meat!

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.474
What?
Oh, my God.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.235
Ha!

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.833
Now we both
have swords, huh?

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.353
What is happening?

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.640
Pretty fucking
literal, Claire!

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.911
We're having a sword fight.
We're both fighting with swords.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.320
I haven't been with another
woman since I've been with you.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.830
Really? I've been
with hundreds of men.

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.309
You whore!

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.759
(GRUNTING)

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.039
Oh, shit!

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:50.680
Claire!

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.816
CLAIRE: Michelle, let's go!
MIKE: Michelle, come on!

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.955
(BOTH GROANING)

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.553
It's been so long.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.030
That's enough!
It's too hot.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.909
(BARKING)

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.398
Wait a minute!
Why are we running up?

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.736
I don't know, it was the only door.
I'm doing the best I can!

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.671
I should not be
running with a sword!

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.576
Okay, all right! Okay. All right.
There's gotta be a way down!

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.999
Get away from there.
Come here.

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.536
Michelle, I'm not so good
with heights, you know.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.675
I'm feeling
kind of tingly.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.056
Claire, look at me.
You have been on

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.911
a helipad before and
it's gonna be fine.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.355
Right. Right, but then they
weren't chasing us with swords!

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.316
You make a good point.
Claire, I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.674
RENAULT: Michelle!

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.318
STEPHAN: God, I need
to do more cardio.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.550
Go over there.
Go over there! Be careful.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.073
You left so suddenly.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.072
Okay, let them go.
I'm the one you want.

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.198
You know, I killed a man in
Costa Rica with this sword.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.276
I guess you would
call it my killing sword.

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.400
(SHOUTING)

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.480
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.473
You're terrible in bed!

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I know.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.160
(WHIMPERING)

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.395
Oh, my God!
Michelle!

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.353
Whoa. Honey!
Let her go, Claire!

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.112
She's making
a fortune in heaven.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.396
Hey, hey.
Hey, smile!

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.869
Okay, everyone
take it easy.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.480
I've been filming
this the whole time.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.680
Take the sword away from her or I
swear to God I'm gonna hit "send."

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.950
Yeah, you're not
gonna hit "send"

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.190
because I'm gonna
chop your hand off.

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.349
(GRUNTING)
CLAIRE: No!

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.714
Oh, my God.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.518
Brother!
RENAULT: No!

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:34.876
Son of a...
(YELLS) Samurai!

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.075
Shut up!

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.038
Oh, thank goodness!
Michelle, are you all right?

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:40.155
MICHELLE: I'm fine!

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.391
I'm about to feel
much better.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.953
RENAULT: No.
Yes!

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.789
Be wrong to ask
for your forgiveness?

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.112
It's Ron talking.

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.038
Oh, Ron!
I'm sorry.

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.636
Renault, do you still need
me to hold them at bay?

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.800
Oh, my God.

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.909
Come here.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:03.875
Ow.

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.240
Ow.

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.269
Michelle, don't make
out with the sociopath!

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.119
I know. You make
a good point.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:15.278
But this is really
good stuff.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.588
Victim here.

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.999
Michelle!

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.755
CLAIRE: Michelle! He literally
tried to kill you!

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.990
MICHELLE: I know.
But his mouth didn't!

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:37.428
MICHELLE: Okay!
Attention, everyone!

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.308
I just wanna say what a great first
year for the Darnell's Darlings.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.597
And what a great first house
for Rachel and Claire.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.033
(ALL CHEERING)

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.155
MIKE: Cheers!

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.279
Finally, they have a decent guestroom
so I can stay over when I get blasted.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.998
CLAIRE: Michelle.
What's "blasted"?

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.310
I'll show you in about
three drinks. (LAUGHING)

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.237
No, she won't.
MICHELLE: I'm kidding.

01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.514
But if I can,

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.631
can I take a serious
note for a minute,

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.280
and I just wanna
say I'm proud of you.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.999
You've built a great family
home here for you and Rachel.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.390
And I'm awfully glad that I
get to be a part of that. So.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.314
Thank you, Michelle.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.469
Thank you.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:15.870
Oh, and thank you for the new sofa!
You really shouldn't have done that.

01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.192
Oh, well, I should
have, though.

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.795
I mean, the old one was very
uncomfortable and very dangerous.

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.711
But don't worry.
I don't wanna hear it.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.519
I did donate it to
just the right person.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.588
(THUDDING)

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.754
Hannah!

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.075
Michelle Darnell
just sent us a sofa bed.

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.152
You know what I call that?
A victory. I win.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.109
Whatever.

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.239
Oh, it is comfortable.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.511
Ah. (CHUCKLING)

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.589

I may have had a little bit
of your Scotch last night

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.712
and I got into
the most wonderful chip.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.030
It was called a Dorito.

It's Rachel!

I took the guard's
keycard. Oh, fuck me.

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.115
I took the card from the geek.
What the fuck is it?

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.639
I took the
guard's keycard.

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.880
I took the card

I should've been so...

Okay.
I can get in there.

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.558
