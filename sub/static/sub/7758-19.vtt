IT WAS TIME.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.846

- ME EITHER.

- HOW OLD WAS HE?

04:08.982 --> 04:11.419
- 60.
- ANCIENT.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.354
- 60'S NOT ANCIENT.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.655
THEY SAY KIDS
WHO ARE BORN TODAY

04:14.688 --> 04:17.891
ARE GOING TO LIVE
TO BE PAST 100.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.593

HEY, CAN YOU IMAGINE

04:19.627 --> 04:20.728
HAVING SEX WHEN YOU'RE 100?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.863
- NO. I CAN'T IMAGINE
DOING IT NOW.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.765
- CHECK OUT KEVIN CHASE.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.455

HE'S KIND OF ADORABLE.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.756
YEAH, HE'S TOTALLY ADORABLE.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.857

COULD I TAKE A RAIN CHECK?

05:13.381 --> 05:15.683

07:02.690 --> 07:06.093
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT SEX RIGHT NOW?

- DEATH GIVES YOU
A REAL HARD-ON.

HOW CAN YOU THINK
ABOUT GETTING YOUR DICK SUCKED?

07:16.704 --> 07:20.207
- THIS IS
MY GRIEF COUNSELOR.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.812

- IS HE ACTUALLY YOUR BOYFRIEND
NOW OR SOMETHING?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.928
- I GUESS.
- THANKS FOR TELLING ME.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.964
- YOU'VE BEEN FUCKING SOME
29-YEAR-OLD GUY THE WHOLE YEAR.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.199
WHY CAN'T I SEE SOMEONE TOO?

07:46.233 --> 07:48.035
- SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU GUYS BEEN--

07:48.068 --> 07:49.537
- OH, ABOUT A MONTH.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.971
ONE DAY
AFTER ENGLISH CLASS,

07:51.004 --> 07:52.239
WE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT SISTER CARRIE

07:52.272 --> 07:54.041
AND HOW AWESOME
AND TRAGIC IT IS.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.209
BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE WERE
INSTANT MESSAGING EACH OTHER

07:56.243 --> 07:58.579
PRACTICALLY EVERY NIGHT.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.980
- OH.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.249
- WELL, WE'RE STILL
BEST FRIENDS, RIGHT?

08:02.282 --> 08:04.918
- I GUESS.
- WELL, AREN'T WE?

08:04.952 --> 08:07.688
- YEAH.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.856
- MARK, BACK HERE.
MARK!

08:08.889 --> 08:10.223
- HAVE YOU GUYS DONE
THE NASTY YET?

08:10.257 --> 08:11.859
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.627
- OH, COME ON.
I TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.295
- WELL,
WE FOOLED AROUND SOME.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.997
HE WANTS TO DO MORE,
AND SO DO I.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.266
I THINK.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.868
ONLY HE'S A LOT MORE
EXPERIENCED THAN I AM,

08:20.901 --> 08:22.870
AND I DO NOT WANT TO COME OFF
AS A TOTAL FREAK

08:22.903 --> 08:25.739
WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.
- SO PRACTICE FIRST.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.942
- NAH. I'VE HEARD HORROR STORIES
ABOUT THE FIRST TIME.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.844
I MEAN,
IF--IF THE GUY ISN'T CAREFUL,

08:30.878 --> 08:32.012
IT CAN BE REALLY PAINFUL.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.146
- YEAH.
I WAS LUCKY.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.715
BRIAN WENT REAL SLOW.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.618
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S WHY I WANT MY FIRST TIME

08:37.651 --> 08:42.289
TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.925
LIKE YOU.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.095
[drums playing]

08:48.128 --> 08:50.330
- [chuckles]

08:50.363 --> 08:53.033
- SHE WANTS YOU TO FUCK HER?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.067
- GAY MEN AND STRAIGHT GIRLS
SLEEPING TOGETHER--

08:54.101 --> 08:56.604
ISN'T THAT ONE OF THE SIGNS
OF THE APOCALYPSE?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.105
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
WITH A WOMAN?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.172
- LOTS OF TIMES.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.108
WHEN I WAS 14,
I HAD SEX

09:01.141 --> 09:02.610
WITH FOUR GIRLS
AT SUMMER CAMP.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.011
WHEN I WAS 15,
I HAD AN AFFAIR

09:04.044 --> 09:05.045
WITH MY MOM'S BEST FRIEND.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.346
WHEN I WAS 16,

09:06.379 --> 09:11.619
I MADE IT WITH MRS. ELSTEAD,
MY GEOMETRY TEACHER.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.353
NO. NO!

09:13.386 --> 09:15.188
- [laughs]
- YOU ASSHOLE.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.325
- WELL, THEN, HON,
UM, HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.660
- BECAUSE AT HIS AGE,
HE COULD RUB UP

09:19.693 --> 09:20.728
AGAINST A TREE
AND GET A HARD-ON.

09:20.761 --> 09:24.031
- HAVING RECENTLY MADE LOVE
TO A WOMAN, I, UM...

09:24.064 --> 09:26.199
I CAN GIVE YOU
A FEW POINTERS.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.802
- BANGING A BULL DYKE FOR JESUS
ISN'T EXACTLY MAKING LOVE.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.037
- I'VE SORT OF BEEN
WITH A WOMAN.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.339
- YOU HAVE?
- TENTH GRADE.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.843
MARSHA GRUNDIG GAVE ME
A BLOW JOB.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.811
WELL, SHE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME.
SHE CHARGED ME 5 BUCKS.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.647
SHE CHARGED EVERYBODY
5 BUCKS.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.650
- THAT'S A--
THAT'S A TOUCHING MEMORY.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.117
- I KNOW I'LL BE DOING
DAPHNE A FAVOR,

09:44.151 --> 09:45.819
BUT I STILL FEEL
KIND OF WEIRD ABOUT IT.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.688
- I THINK IT'S A REAL COMPLIMENT
SHE ASKED YOU TO DO THIS.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.223
- YEAH, IT MEANS
SHE REALLY TRUSTS YOU.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.392
- GO TO HER, JUSTIN.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.729
TEACH HER WHAT IT IS
TO BE A REAL WOMAN.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.865
- LIKE SOMEBODY TAUGHT YOU.
[laughs]

09:57.898 --> 10:00.000
- BE CAREFUL.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.803
- OH, SHIT.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.305
- WELL, YOU WERE BOUND
TO RUN INTO HIM EVENTUALLY.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.276
- WHY DID EVENTUALLY
HAVE TO BE TONIGHT?

10:09.309 --> 10:10.410
WHAT DO I SAY?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.112
- WHY SAY ANYTHING?
JUST IGNORE HIM.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.413
- I SHOULD GO APOLOGIZE.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.216
- NO, YOU SHOULD STAY
AND ANSWER ME THIS:

10:16.249 --> 10:21.789
LENNY OR, UH, SQUIGGY?

10:21.822 --> 10:24.357
[pop music]

10:24.391 --> 10:29.730
- * HOW DO YOU SAY
WE BELONG TOGETHER *

10:29.763 --> 10:31.131
* WE BELONG FOREVER

10:31.164 --> 10:32.700
- HEY, BLAKE.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.435
UM, LISTEN.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.972
- LOOK, I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.075
- THAT'S NOT WHY I WANTED
TO TALK WITH YOU.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.311
LOOK, I FOUND MY WALLET.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.979
IT WAS IN EMMETT'S COUCH.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.181
- CONGRATULATIONS.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.283
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HORRIBLE--

10:50.317 --> 10:54.421
REALLY HORRIBLE I FEEL.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.089
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE GOING

10:56.123 --> 10:58.458
THROUGH A TOUGH TIME
RIGHT NOW.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.193
AND I REALIZE
THAT AFTER WHAT I DID,

11:00.227 --> 11:04.064
YOU'VE GOT NO REASON
TO BELIEVE ME, BUT...

11:04.097 --> 11:07.768
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

11:07.801 --> 11:09.870
YOU KNOW,
A SYMPATHETIC EAR

11:09.903 --> 11:14.007
OR A SHOULDER TO CRY ON

11:14.041 --> 11:17.811
OR AN OBJECTIVE EYE--

11:17.845 --> 11:21.181
- HOW ABOUT THROWING
IN AN ARM AND A LEG?

11:24.184 --> 11:28.956
- WELL, THAT TOO.
IF YOU WANT 'EM.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.250
- THIS IS THE ONE
HE SHOULD BE BURIED IN.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.920
WORN OUT AND DREARY,
JUST LIKE HIM.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.790
- WELL, DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
RUN IT BY YOUR SISTER FIRST?

12:02.823 --> 12:05.458
- HMM, SHE'D PROBABLY SEE
THIS UGLY, OLD SUIT

12:05.492 --> 12:06.960
AND START CRYING AGAIN.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.196
- WELL, AT LEAST
SHE'S EXPRESSING HOW SHE FEELS.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.998
- SHE'S MILKING IT
FOR ATTENTION.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.200
- DON'T BE CYNICAL.
- CLAIRE IS A CUNT.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.268
DAD COULDN'T EVEN
STAND HER.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.336
HER HUSBAND
COULDN'T STAND HER.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.438
HER FUCKING KIDS
CAN'T STAND HER.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.508
SO WHILE SHE'S BUSY
BEING A BASKET CASE,

12:21.541 --> 12:23.310
I'M STUCK DOING
EVERYTHING ELSE.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.512
THE FUNERAL HOME,
THE CEMETERY,

12:25.545 --> 12:27.214
THE OBITUARY.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.949
- WELL, I SAID I WOULD HELP.
- YOU WANT TO HELP?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.283
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A TIE

12:30.317 --> 12:32.019
THAT'S NOT TOO OFFENSIVE,
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.254
- BRIAN.
- WHAT?

12:34.287 --> 12:37.490
- PACKETS OR SUGAR CUBES?

12:37.524 --> 12:39.126
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A HOUSE FULL OF GUESTS.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.094
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT PEOPLE PREFER.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.396
- I'M SURE NO ONE
GIVES A SHIT.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.399
- UM, MY MOM
SAYS THAT PEOPLE

12:46.433 --> 12:48.268
AT THE DINER PREFER PACKETS
THREE TO ONE

12:48.301 --> 12:50.804
BECAUSE THE--THE CUBES
ARE INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED,

12:50.838 --> 12:52.272
AND THEY FALL ON THE FLOOR,
AND PEOPLE STEP ON THEM.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.974
- HOW IS YOUR MOTHER,
MICHAEL?

12:54.007 --> 12:57.077
- SHE'S FINE, MRS. KINNEY,
THANK YOU.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.380
- SHE WAS ALWAYS
SUCH A CHARACTER.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.449
PLEASE REMEMBER
TO THANK HER FOR THE, UM,

13:02.482 --> 13:04.417
SANDWICH PLATTER.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
- OH, I WILL.
AND, UH--

13:06.153 --> 13:07.420
I HAVE TO SAY I'M SORRY

13:07.454 --> 13:09.522
FOR YOUR LOSS.
- THANK YOU, MICHAEL.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.025
BRIAN, IF YOU SEE ANYTHING

13:12.059 --> 13:13.460
YOU WANT,
JUST PLEASE TAKE IT.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.428
I'VE CALLED THE GOODWILL,
AND THEY'RE COMING TOMORROW.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.897
- THAT WAS QUICK.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.165
- WELL, I DON'T LIKE
SEEING THINGS

13:18.198 --> 13:22.836
LYING AROUND,
YOU KNOW THAT.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.038
YOUR FATHER SPENT
MORE WEEKENDS WITH THAT

13:25.072 --> 13:28.408
THAN HE DID WITH ME.

13:30.143 --> 13:34.948
PACKETS, GOOD.
WELL, THAT'S DECIDED.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.017
- [exhales]

13:41.354 --> 13:44.057
I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS LIKE
AT YOUR HOUSE.

13:44.091 --> 13:47.260
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I WAS ALWAYS OVER AT YOURS.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.609
- A GUY THREW UP
ON MY BED.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.477
- WHAT?

14:04.511 --> 14:05.478
- THE PLACE
WHERE I'M STAYING.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.247
I WENT
BACK THERE TONIGHT,

14:07.280 --> 14:10.550
AND SOME TWEAKED OUT ASSHOLE
BARFED ON MY BED.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.186
- HOW HORRIBLE.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.421
- I CAN'T
STAY THERE ANYMORE.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.323
I-I JUST CAN'T.
- I DON'T BLAME YOU.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.360
- THEN I THOUGHT
OF WHAT YOU SAID.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.529
THAT I COULD COUNT ON YOU
FOR ANYTHING.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.631
- SO YOU CAME HERE?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.967
- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.202
- I'M GLAD YOU DID.

14:29.236 --> 14:33.373
[clears throat]
WELL, COME IN.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.108
- YOU SURE?

14:35.142 --> 14:38.645
- SURE,
I'M SURE.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.380
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO STAY HERE TONIGHT

14:40.413 --> 14:44.651
OR A COUPLE NIGHTS.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.420
DID YOU BRING
YOUR STUFF?

14:47.454 --> 14:51.691
[yawns] WELL, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO TRAVEL LIGHT.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.694
COME ON.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.364
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I'M CLEAN. I SWEAR.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.268
- I BELIEVE YOU.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.938
- THANKS.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.587
- UM, LOOK.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.123
NO.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.159
LET'S, UH--

15:26.193 --> 15:30.297
LET'S NOT RUSH
INTO THIS, OKAY?

15:30.330 --> 15:34.234
I MEAN, WE BOTH NEED TIME
TO COMPREHEND

15:34.267 --> 15:38.238
AND TO PROCESS
HOW WE FEEL.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.507
HMM?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.075
[exhales]

15:42.109 --> 15:45.212
THAT SAID, I THINK
IT WOULD BE

15:45.245 --> 15:47.614
MORE APPROPRIATE,

15:47.647 --> 15:50.317
NOT TO MENTION RESPONSIBLE

15:50.350 --> 15:53.486
FOR BOTH OF US TO, UH--

15:53.520 --> 15:55.588
OH, FUCK IT!

15:55.622 --> 15:58.591
[opera music]

15:58.625 --> 16:05.265
*

16:05.298 --> 16:08.335
- LET US REMEMBER
THAT WE ARE DUST,

16:08.368 --> 16:11.004
AND WE WILL RETURN
TO DUST.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.240
ALMIGHTY GOD,

16:13.273 --> 16:15.475
THROUGH THE DEATH OF YOUR SON
ON THE CROSS,

16:15.508 --> 16:18.445
YOU HAVE OVERCOME DEATH FOR US.
- [sobbing]

16:18.478 --> 16:21.781
- THROUGH HIS BURIAL
AND RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD,

16:21.814 --> 16:24.351
YOU HAVE MADE THE GRAVE
A HOLY PLACE...

16:24.384 --> 16:26.219
- [sobbing loudly]
- AND RESTORED TO US

16:26.253 --> 16:30.357
ETERNAL LIFE.

16:30.390 --> 16:34.361
WE PRAY FOR THOSE WHO DIED
BELIEVING IN JESUS

16:34.394 --> 16:36.529
AND ARE BURIED
WITH HIM

16:36.563 --> 16:40.567
IN THE HOPE
OF RISING AGAIN.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.536
GOD OF THE LIVING
AND THE DEAD,

16:43.570 --> 16:47.107
MAY THOSE WHO FAITHFULLY
BELIEVED IN YOU ON EARTH

16:47.140 --> 16:52.512
PRAISE YOU FOREVER
IN THE JOY OF HEAVEN.

16:52.545 --> 16:57.517
WE ASK THIS IN THE NAME
OF JESUS THE LORD.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.386
AMEN.

16:59.419 --> 17:03.290
*

17:03.323 --> 17:04.824
THROUGH THE MERCY OF GOD,

17:04.857 --> 17:07.327
MAY JACK
AND ALL THE FAITHFUL DEPARTED

17:07.360 --> 17:10.597
REST IN THE PEACE OF CHRIST.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.166
AMEN.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.169
*

17:16.203 --> 17:19.239
IN THE HOPE OF THE RESURRECTION,
LET US...

17:19.272 --> 17:24.344
*

17:24.377 --> 17:26.446
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
AND OF THE SON

17:26.479 --> 17:29.282
AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

17:29.316 --> 17:37.324
*

17:37.357 --> 17:40.327
- COME BACK!
- NO!

17:45.298 --> 17:47.567
- CLAIRE, WOULD YOU PULL
YOURSELF TOGETHER, PLEASE?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.403
- DADDY DIED, MOTHER.
I AM ALLOWED TO FALL APART.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.805
- FINE.
THEN FALL APART.

17:52.839 --> 17:53.806
- WOULD YOU LIKE
A SANDWICH?

17:53.840 --> 17:54.807
- CAN WE LEAVE?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.109
- SHH.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.711
- WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR MONTHS.
YEARS.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.348
- DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO FUCKING
LOUD, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE?

18:01.381 --> 18:03.616
- SORRY, FATHER.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.485
WE HAVE TO STAY FOR BRIAN.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.788
- HE HASN'T SAID A WORD.
- OR EVEN CRIED.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.391
- WELL, CLAIRE'S DOING
A BANG-UP JOB FOR EVERYBODY.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.226
- [sobbing loudly]

18:13.260 --> 18:16.263
WOULD YOU LIKE
A SANDWICH?

18:16.296 --> 18:18.598
- WHAT'S IN THE BAG,
UNCLE BRI?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.201
- GRANDPA'S HEAD.
[children gasp]

18:21.234 --> 18:24.837
DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?
- AAH!

18:27.340 --> 18:29.409
- WE BETTER GO.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.444
WE HAVE TO PICK UP GUS.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.214
- AND I HAVE SOMEBODY
STAYING WITH ME,

18:34.247 --> 18:36.516
SO I SHOULD--
- YOU DO?

18:36.549 --> 18:38.251
YOU DON'T.

18:38.285 --> 18:41.254
- OH, EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.890
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE...
[sniffles]

18:43.923 --> 18:48.495
IF WE ALL SHARED
SOME MEMORIES OF DADDY.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.598
FATHER, WOULD YOU START?
[sniffles]

18:51.631 --> 18:55.568
- I MUST CONFESS
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM WELL.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.706
HE NEVER CAME TO MASS.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.908
- OH, UM--

19:01.941 --> 19:06.446
ANYONE ELSE?

19:14.787 --> 19:17.390
- IT--IT WAS
A WHILE AGO.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.926
BRIAN AND I
WERE IN COLLEGE.

19:19.959 --> 19:24.364
HE--HE TOLD ME ONCE
I SMELLED NICE.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.534
OH, AND THEN HE GAVE ME
A MINT.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.946
- I REMEMBER--

19:39.979 --> 19:42.682
THIS IS JUST
AFTER I'D MET BRIAN,

19:42.715 --> 19:44.584
MR. KINNEY
TOOK US BOWLING.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.652
[pins falling]

19:45.685 --> 19:48.488
UM, AND I'M
A TERRIBLE BOWLER.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.290
AND SO IS BRIAN.

19:50.323 --> 19:54.561
I THINK OUR SCORE WAS,
LIKE, NINE AFTER SEVEN FRAMES.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.630
AND THEN
A MIRACLE HAPPENED.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.567
BRIAN ROLLED THE BALL,
AND IT WAS HEADED

20:00.600 --> 20:02.235
TOWARDS THE GUTTER
LIKE ALL THE REST,

20:02.269 --> 20:05.505
BUT THEN SUDDENLY,
IT CHANGED DIRECTION.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.007
AND IT WAS
A STRIKE.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.442
AND WE WERE SO EXCITED,

20:09.476 --> 20:10.877
AND WE WERE JUMPING UP
AND DOWN

20:10.910 --> 20:12.712
THAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT MR. KINNEY

20:12.745 --> 20:13.980
HAD COME BACK FROM THE BAR

20:14.013 --> 20:15.982
AND SEEN THE WHOLE THING.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.851
AND HE RAN OVER TO BRIAN,
AND HE PICKED HIM UP,

20:18.885 --> 20:20.987
AND HE HUGGED HIM,
AND HE KISSED HIM,

20:21.020 --> 20:24.257
AND HE TOLD HIM
HOW PROUD HE WAS OF HIM.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.026
AND OF COURSE,
BRIAN GOT ALL EMBARRASSED

20:27.059 --> 20:30.797
AND RAN OFF.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.365
I GUESS THAT MOMENT
MEANT A LOT TO ME

20:32.399 --> 20:36.536
BECAUSE I NEVER
HAD A FATHER, AND...

20:36.569 --> 20:40.773
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER
THAT DAY AND THAT HUG.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.479
- [sobs]
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.

20:46.513 --> 20:50.683
- THAT WAS A LOVELY STORY,
MICHAEL.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.320
- YEAH, MICHAEL,
THAT WAS LOVELY.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.021
[laughs]

20:55.054 --> 20:57.924
IT MAKES ME WANT TO SHARE
SOME MEMORIES OF MY OWN.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.728
SOMETHING
WE COULD ALL TREASURE.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.364
LIKE THE NIGHT
THAT HE FOUND OUT

21:04.397 --> 21:08.501
THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT
WITH ME.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.803
HE TOLD MOM TO PUT ON
HER MOST BEAUTIFUL DRESS,

21:10.837 --> 21:13.306
TOOK HER TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE
RESTAURANT IN TOWN,

21:13.340 --> 21:16.509
POURED HER A GLASS OF BUBBLY
AND THEN--GET THIS.

21:16.543 --> 21:20.513
HE LEANED OVER,
AND HE SAID,

21:20.547 --> 21:23.916
"JOANIE,

21:23.950 --> 21:25.452
YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF
AN ABORTION

21:25.485 --> 21:27.954
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER FUCKING KID."

21:27.987 --> 21:31.023
- [gasps]
- [clears throat]

21:31.057 --> 21:36.028
- CLAIRE, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SHARE?

21:36.062 --> 21:38.731
- [sniffling]

21:40.767 --> 21:42.402
- I THINK
WE SHOULD GO.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.475
- COME ON IN.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.877
- THANKS.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.919
- YOU CAN PUT YOUR BACKPACK
OVER HERE.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.957
DO YOU WANT TO LISTEN
TO SOMETHING?

22:04.991 --> 22:05.958
DAPH?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.560
- HUH?

22:07.594 --> 22:09.962
OH.
YEAH, WHATEVER.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.965
WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO HEAR.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.505
SO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE?

22:18.538 --> 22:22.509
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE AN HOUR.

22:22.542 --> 22:23.776
- 'CAUSE I GOT TO BE HOME
BY 6:00.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.912
I PROMISED MY MOM,
AND MY GRANDMA'S COMING OVER

22:25.945 --> 22:27.414
FOR DINNER, SO--

22:27.447 --> 22:29.015
- * HOW CAN WE KNOW

22:29.048 --> 22:30.817
- IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS, THEN--

22:30.850 --> 22:33.019
- NO.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.923
NO, I-I DO.

22:36.956 --> 22:41.461
- * TODAY IS ALL,
ALL WE HAVE *

22:41.494 --> 22:42.829
* WE HAVE THIS MOMENT

22:42.862 --> 22:44.130
- DO YOU HAVE ANY CONDOMS?

22:44.163 --> 22:46.899
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

22:46.933 --> 22:47.800
- 'CAUSE I BROUGHT SOME
IN CASE

22:47.834 --> 22:51.871
AND, UH, LUBRICANT,
SPERMICIDAL FOAM.

A SHOT TOGETHER.

23:18.465 --> 23:21.434
ONLY AFTERWARDS, DAPH,

23:21.468 --> 23:23.770
LET'S NOT GET WEIRD.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.905

- I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER

24:35.608 --> 24:39.779
HIS SISTER SCREAMING,
"YOU SHIT! YOU SHIT!"

24:39.812 --> 24:42.582
- WHAT ABOUT
FATHER O'WHAT'S-HIS-FACE

24:42.615 --> 24:44.517
CARRYING HIS MOTHER
UP TO HER ROOM?

24:44.551 --> 24:45.818
- [laughing]

24:45.852 --> 24:48.588
THEY DIDN'T COME DOWN
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.723
- HMM.

24:52.759 --> 24:53.926
- DO YOU THINK
IT'S REALLY TRUE?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.562
WHAT HIS FATHER SAID?

24:55.595 --> 24:57.997
- YOU KNOW HOW BRIAN'S ALWAYS
TRYING TO SHOCK EVERYBODY.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.766
BUT SOMEHOW I BELIEVE IT.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.969
- CAN YOU IMAGINE GROWING UP
IN THAT HOUSE?

25:03.002 --> 25:05.071
HOW DID HE EVER SURVIVE?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.606
- WHO'S TO SAY HE DID?

25:06.639 --> 25:07.874
HEY, THESE ARE
KIND OF NICE.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.075
- YEAH.

25:09.108 --> 25:12.011
YEAH, THEY'LL MAKE
A FABULOUS CENTERPIECE

25:12.044 --> 25:16.048
FOR YOUR ROMANTIC DINNER
FOR TWO.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.284
- I THINK I'LL USE THAT CHINA
MY GRANDMOTHER LEFT ME.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.319
- MM. PERFECT.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.889
PERFECT.
AND THE GOOD CRYSTAL.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.224
I'M SURE
BLAKE'LL APPRECIATE THAT.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.159
- FUCK YOU.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.661
- EXCUSE ME?

25:28.695 --> 25:30.329
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
HE'S NOT USING.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.264
- OKAY, UM, CAN I--
CAN I HAVE A SHOW OF HANDS?

25:32.298 --> 25:36.068
HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK THE TWINK
IS NO LONGER TWEAKING?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.205
NO ONE.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.107
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE ALL WRONG.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.209
- NO, TEDDY, YOU ARE.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.711
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.079
- YOU DON'T KNOW.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.581
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

25:48.615 --> 25:49.916
- JEALOUS?

25:49.949 --> 25:52.184
- JEALOUS THAT I'VE ACTUALLY
FOUND SOMEBODY

25:52.218 --> 25:54.220
WHO CARES ABOUT ME
AND WANTS TO BE WITH ME.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.923
- HE'S USING YOU, TEDDY.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.791
THAT'S WHAT USERS DO.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.760
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.762
AND YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME
TO HAVE SOMETHING

26:02.795 --> 26:05.364
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.567
YOU'RE LIKE EVERY OTHER FAG
IN THE WORLD.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.217
- YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.686
- FOR WHAT?
[clears throat]

26:26.719 --> 26:29.355
- YOU KNOW DAMN WELL.
HE WAS YOUR DAD.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.890
EVEN THOUGH HE WASN'T
ALWAYS NICE TO YOU,

26:30.923 --> 26:32.959
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU DESERVE
A LITTLE RESPECT.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.360
- BULLSHIT.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.629
IF YOU DON'T EARN RESPECT
WHEN YOU'RE ALIVE,

26:36.663 --> 26:38.197
YOU DON'T DESERVE IT
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.367
ANYWAY,
YOU WERE VERY RESPECTFUL.

26:41.400 --> 26:46.338
EVERYONE WAS VERY TOUCHED
BY YOUR LITTLE MEMORY.

26:46.372 --> 26:50.209
ONLY YOU
DON'T REMEMBER SHIT.

26:52.979 --> 26:56.883
[snorts]
WANT SOME?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.851
- HAVEN'T YOU ABUSED YOURSELF
ENOUGH?

26:58.885 --> 27:00.853
- NO.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.727
I GOT A STRIKE THAT DAY.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.396
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.198
AND WE WERE JUMPING UP
AND DOWN, SCREAMING.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.199
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT TOO.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.767
- YEAH, YOU GOT A STRIKE!

27:14.801 --> 27:15.835
- AND THAT'S WHEN JACK
CAME BACK

27:15.868 --> 27:17.670
FROM THE BAR
AND SURPRISED US.

27:17.704 --> 27:18.805
BUT HE DIDN'T HUG ME.

27:18.838 --> 27:22.008
THAT WAS JUST YOUR "GEE,
I WISH I HAD A DADDY" FANTASY.

27:22.041 --> 27:25.044
YOU HUGGED ME.
REMEMBER?

27:25.077 --> 27:30.016
AND I GAVE YOU A BIG KISS.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.383
THEN THAT'S WHEN HE SAID,

27:31.417 --> 27:34.386
"ARE YOU A COUPLE
OF FUCKIN' FAIRIES?"

27:34.420 --> 27:36.355
AND THEN I PUSHED YOU
AWAY SO HARD,

27:36.388 --> 27:38.825
YOU PRACTICALLY ROLLED
DOWN THE LANE.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.159
AND THEN I RAN.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.228
AND I RAN.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.197
AND IT'S HOT IN HERE.

27:56.208 --> 28:00.146
- MAYBE COFFEE
WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

28:06.518 --> 28:10.890
- STAY HERE WITH ME.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.324
- OKAY.

28:12.358 --> 28:16.695
JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.280
[laughs]

28:34.313 --> 28:38.250
YOU'RE HIGH.
- YEAH.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.359
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:47.393 --> 28:51.230
WAIT.
- I'M JUST FOOLING AROUND.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.165
- NO. NO.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.935
WAIT.

28:58.237 --> 29:02.108
- ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU
ALWAYS WANTED, MICHAEL?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.976
- WHAT, A DRUNKEN FUCK,

29:04.010 --> 29:06.378
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT YOUR DAD?

29:06.412 --> 29:09.381
I NEVER WANTED THAT.

29:20.026 --> 29:25.564
- * AH

29:25.597 --> 29:27.800

*

47:37.388 --> 47:41.960
* IT'S ALL I CAN DO

47:41.993 --> 47:44.529
* CAN'T KEEP MYSELF

47:44.562 --> 47:48.900
* FROM THINKING OF YOU

47:48.934 --> 47:50.368
*

47:50.401 --> 47:53.671
* I QUIT TRYING

47:53.704 --> 47:57.909
*

47:57.943 --> 48:02.613
* I HOPE IT'S THE SAME

48:02.647 --> 48:05.550
* AND WHEN MY NAME

48:05.583 --> 48:08.954
* CROSSES YOUR MIND

48:08.987 --> 48:12.023
*

48:12.057 --> 48:13.691
* YOU MISS ME

48:13.724 --> 48:18.629
*

48:18.663 --> 48:23.401
* NO WORDS I CAN SAY

48:23.434 --> 48:26.704
* CAN TRULY TELL

48:26.737 --> 48:32.343
* ALL MY HEART

48:32.377 --> 48:35.413
* AND LONGING

48:35.446 --> 48:41.419
*

48:41.452 --> 48:46.424
* A FOOLISH MAN

48:46.457 --> 48:50.161
* WHO'S STILL A FOOL

48:50.195 --> 48:53.431
* FOR YOU

48:53.464 --> 48:57.502
*

48:57.535 --> 49:00.705
* STILL A FOOL

49:00.738 --> 49:03.708
* FOR YOU
