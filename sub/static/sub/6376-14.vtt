00:44.077 --> 00:47.638
Too funny!
Should one of us change, or...

00:47.680 --> 00:50.649
- What are you going on about?
- We're wearing the same dress.

00:50.683 --> 00:54.380
No, we're not.
Why are you being so weird?

00:54.421 --> 00:57.288
Oh, it's Fashion Week,
it makes you all anxious.

00:57.323 --> 00:59.188
Like a lesbian at a makeup counter.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.591
- What? I love Fashion Week.
- Uh-huh.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.221
Okay, maybe I used to think
that it was a big fuss about nothing,

01:04.263 --> 01:06.630
but now I'm into it. I get it.

01:06.666 --> 01:07.928
Clearly.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.226
Oh!

01:09.269 --> 01:11.294
Mandy,

01:11.337 --> 01:15.433
next time you decide to take in a giant,
crazy stray, ask me first.

01:15.475 --> 01:19.935
Marc! Marc! Oh, thank God!
Thank God I didn't miss you. Hi, ladies.

01:19.979 --> 01:22.641
Remember you said
you'd give me a goodbye kiss?

01:22.682 --> 01:25.150
No, what I said was, "Don't touch me. "

01:25.185 --> 01:29.246
How about I just close my eyes
and you kiss me anywhere you want?

01:30.423 --> 01:32.254
Oh. Bye.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.194
How much longer must I be
a hostage in my own home, Mandy?

01:36.229 --> 01:37.856
I have enough stress as it is.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.694
It's his first Fashion Week as editor.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.963
Yes, and Wilhelmina is up my grinch
to prove myself.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.401
And that's really cute,
by the way. New?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.429
Isn't that funny,
that we're wearing the same outfit?

01:47.740 --> 01:49.298
Who is? What?

01:50.910 --> 01:53.811
Yeah. I know. Speaking of crazy,
when is she leaving?

01:55.715 --> 01:58.149
Do your jobs, people.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.483
<i>Mode's Ten Designers to Watch Show
is in two days</i>

02:01.521 --> 02:04.285
and as of yet, half the seats are empty.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.953
Which is just as well,
because one of our designers just quit.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.120
And to make things worse,

02:09.162 --> 02:11.790
Daniel's banning male models
from the show.

02:11.831 --> 02:16.063
Everyone in this room
is an editor. Allegedly.

02:16.836 --> 02:19.999
The only person who's not
a complete disappointment is Betty.

02:20.039 --> 02:23.304
Let Betty be a shining example
to all of you.

02:23.343 --> 02:27.336
Working day and night
like a trusty old mule.

02:27.380 --> 02:31.407
And as a reward, Betty will be
writing this month's book review.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.121
<i>A History
of the Sewing Machine. "</i>

02:36.156 --> 02:41.458
- I've been meaning to read this.
- How serendipitous. Go ahead, dear.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.521
Right now? What about the meeting?

02:44.564 --> 02:47.931
Well, it is 800 pages.
Best get cracking.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.398
Aye-aye, Captain.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.673
- Uh, Amanda...
- Chocolate E-Claire. How's it hanging?

03:00.713 --> 03:06.515
It's hanging fine, thank you.
Amanda, I won't be in for a few days.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.818
Ooh, where to? South Dakota
to see your long-lost, secret son again?

03:09.856 --> 03:14.190
No, and you don't have to ask me that
every time I leave the office.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.854
I'll just be tied up with fashion shows.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.022
And if Daniel needs me,
I'll be on my cell.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.554
Sure thing.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.001
And, Amanda, about my son...

03:31.144 --> 03:34.545
If you could just forget
I ever said anything about it.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.606
Said anything about what?

03:39.819 --> 03:42.788
- Okay, so... Sorry.
- Oh! Sorry.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.051
<i>I'm reading
the History of the Sewing Machine</i>

03:45.091 --> 03:46.752
and I can barely put it down.

03:46.793 --> 03:47.987
New headset?

03:48.027 --> 03:50.962
Yep, brand new, state-of-the-art,
hands-free, same one the CIA uses.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.055
Oh.

03:52.098 --> 03:54.794
So, which show are you covering
for Fashion Week?

03:54.834 --> 03:57.359
- I'm not covering a show.
- Sure, you are.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.372
All the editors get assigned a show.
Some have two or three.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.565
Oh.

04:03.710 --> 04:07.043
That's why Wilhelmina
didn't want me in the meeting today.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.741
She assigned me a book report

04:08.781 --> 04:11.113
while everyone else
is out covering Fashion Week.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.015
Come on, Betty,
I'm sure you're being paranoid.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.247
It's probably an oversight.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.685
It wasn't an oversight.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.488
Come on, I thought we agreed
everyone gets a show.

04:20.526 --> 04:24.053
Daniel, you nixed my male models
and we lost a designer.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.861
I'm scrambling here
just to try to put this show on its feet.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.730
I don't have time
to consider Betty's feelings.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.794
I don't think it's fair to single her out.
I'm gonna call her right now.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.829
Do what you want. You always do.

04:33.873 --> 04:37.741
Dial Betty Suarez mobile.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.301
It's a new earpiece, state-of-the-art.

04:39.345 --> 04:42.109
<i>Say "okay" to dial Becky Jonas.</i>

04:42.148 --> 04:45.640
No. Dial Betty Suarez mobile.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.916
<i>- Dial Becky Juarez.
- No. No. Sorry.</i>

04:49.522 --> 04:51.149
<i>- Becky Jonas.
- No.</i>

04:52.725 --> 04:56.559
Hmm, I don't know
how you can stand to live with Marc.

04:56.596 --> 05:00.088
Sometimes I just want to wrap my arms
and legs around him like an octopus

05:00.133 --> 05:02.795
and squeeze him
until he loves me back.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.234
You know Marc's gay, right?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.701
You're hilarious.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.208
- What you looking for, doll?
- My green tube mini dress.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.905
There's a hot party
at Levant East tonight.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.573
Ooh. At Hotel on Rivington. Fun.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.277
Oh, wait! You know what?
I think I borrowed that dress.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.876
Hold on. Yes!

05:20.987 --> 05:22.420
Here you go.

05:22.755 --> 05:26.122
Yeah, you just put a little perfume
under the pits, it's good as new.

05:26.159 --> 05:31.825
My mini. It's all stretched out.
Helen, what am I gonna wear?

05:31.864 --> 05:33.229
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.097
What do you got, an hour?
I'll make you something.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.659
Yeah. You're gonna make me a dress.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.948
And voilÃ !

05:51.317 --> 05:56.254
Oh, my God.
Helen, you totally just made me a dress.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.382
- Mmm-hmm.
- How are you so good at sewing?

05:58.424 --> 06:00.551
You know I was Amish
for a while, right?

06:00.593 --> 06:01.617
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.926
Just for a summer.
For this guy I was dating, Nebediah.

06:04.964 --> 06:06.795
Mmm, he had the softest beard.

06:06.833 --> 06:10.599
Anyway, all those long nights
in Pennsylvania without television,

06:10.636 --> 06:12.900
you get pretty good
with a needle and thread.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.430
Helen,
could you make more of these?

06:15.475 --> 06:16.840
Sure. Why?

06:18.711 --> 06:21.771
With your crazy sewing skills
and my crazy fashion sense,

06:21.814 --> 06:25.773
and a fistful of mood stabilizers,
we could be a real design team.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.012
What do you think?

06:27.053 --> 06:30.216
I've never said no to a proposition,
I'm not about to start now.

06:30.256 --> 06:31.553
Ahhh!

06:33.826 --> 06:35.817
One, two, three.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.961
Can you believe the restaurant
didn't want this anymore?

06:39.999 --> 06:42.365
- Yes. It's awful.
- It's classy.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.667
When you walk into a house
and you see a big beautiful chandelier,

06:45.705 --> 06:47.900
you think, "These people have class. "

06:49.542 --> 06:51.407
Betty, it says
that you have a missed message.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.968
Let me see. That's Daniel.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.206
Will you just
play the message out loud?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.010
<i>- Yeah.
- Maybe a little higher, mi hija.</i>

06:56.048 --> 06:57.572
Ready? One, two, three...

06:57.617 --> 06:59.141
<i>Hey, Betty,
I'm with Wilhelmina.</i>

06:59.185 --> 07:03.121
<i>Uh, oh, say "hi," Wilhelmina.
Come on, say "hi. "</i>

07:03.156 --> 07:04.316
<i>Hello, Betty.</i>

07:04.357 --> 07:06.325
<i>Good news. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.</i>

07:06.359 --> 07:09.055
<i>You are covering
a show for Fashion Week.</i>

07:09.128 --> 07:10.527
Yay!

07:10.563 --> 07:11.894
- Betty!
- Oh!

07:11.931 --> 07:13.592
Betty.
- Sorry. Sorry.

07:13.633 --> 07:17.160
<i>I'll e-mail you the details,
okay? See you tomorrow, bye.</i>

07:17.203 --> 07:19.296
Oh, what a relief. You can just delete it.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.566
<i>Are you happy?</i>

07:20.606 --> 07:22.972
<i>Now we've got Betty
judging a fashion show.</i>

07:23.009 --> 07:25.534
<i>Come on, what's the big deal?
She's one of our best writers.</i>

07:25.578 --> 07:28.342
<i>In features.
But this is about taste.</i>

07:28.381 --> 07:33.216
<i>Betty never met a paisley, or a plaid,
or awful butterfly belt she didn't love.</i>

07:33.252 --> 07:34.981
<i>Do you think she has good taste?</i>

07:35.021 --> 07:37.489
<i>I mean, honestly, Daniel. Really?</i>

07:39.459 --> 07:42.826
<i>Why is that light blinking?
You did hang up?</i>

07:42.862 --> 07:46.127
<i>Of course I hung up,
I'm not stupid, you know. God!</i>

07:46.833 --> 07:48.130
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

08:03.916 --> 08:05.645
There's my favorite editor.

08:05.685 --> 08:09.052
Just wanted to apologize
for the message I left.

08:09.088 --> 08:13.286
Yep, I got all five of your
"I'm sorry" messages, too. It's okay.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.922
Really? Can I maybe see
that signature Betty smile? There it is.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.125
Look, Daniel, I know
I make bold choices in my fashion.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.660
I really think in the last four years
you've learned a ton. I know that.

08:25.705 --> 08:26.729
Wilhelmina doesn't.

08:26.772 --> 08:29.798
What does it say if people around here
don't trust my taste?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.707
I guess you're just gonna have to
change their minds.

08:31.744 --> 08:36.078
You can start by writing the best review
of the fashion show we assigned you.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.913
It is kind of a rinky-dink show
that nobody really cares about,

08:38.951 --> 08:39.975
but it's a show.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.284
And the important thing is,
you're not mad at me.

08:43.322 --> 08:44.949
Leave the plant.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.254
Okay.

08:56.502 --> 09:00.598
Because Daniel is dead set
against using male models,

09:00.640 --> 09:03.438
and like it or not,
I have to respect his opinion.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.704
He was very specific.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.907
<i>No male models
in the Mode show ever.</i>

09:07.947 --> 09:09.278
Really? Daniel?

09:09.315 --> 09:11.875
I could never ask him that.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.988
Well, I guess a lot of women
find him handsome.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.547
And, yeah,
I suppose he's in great shape...

09:18.591 --> 09:22.288
Well, the best shape of his life,
but he would never do it.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.388
Never do what?
What are you talking about?

09:25.631 --> 09:27.622
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there.

09:27.667 --> 09:31.603
This diva designer wants to use you
as a model in her show to get us press,

09:31.637 --> 09:33.969
and I told her absolutely not.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.974
Oh, right. Mmm-hmm, thank you.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.445
Wait. VoilÃ .

09:42.481 --> 09:44.847
Wilhelmina, I'm thinking,

09:44.884 --> 09:50.186
maybe we're being a little rash
about this whole male-model thing.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.055
We might want to rethink this.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.897
Okay, we are, like,
bizarrely good at this.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.865
<i>And since that designer
dropped out of the Mode show,</i>

10:00.900 --> 10:03.596
we could totally take their spot. Helen?

10:03.636 --> 10:04.830
You just had
a couple of flyaways.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.862
You are so sexy. Why are you so sexy?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.704
And you know what?
You look like you could take a punch.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.903
Where are you from?

10:12.878 --> 10:15.972
- I'm actually visiting from South Dakota.
- I love South Dakota.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.346
It's a nice place. I'm sorry.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.180
Do you know
where I could find Claire Meade?

10:19.218 --> 10:24.815
Helen! No flirting! We don't have time
for rugged and handsome...

10:24.857 --> 10:27.291
Is that a dimple? I could totally
set up a tent in that dimple.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.486
Mmm-hmm, I'll be naked in it.

10:28.527 --> 10:34.056
No. Focus. We have
to finish our line for Fashion Week.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.328
God!

10:35.368 --> 10:39.429
Well, thanks. This has been weird
and not at all helpful.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.346
Watch it.

10:53.619 --> 10:56.645
Ugh. Hey, B, I think this is
one of those showcases

10:56.689 --> 10:58.884
for designers
who didn't make it to Bryant Park.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.551
Well, at least we're in the front row.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.391
We're in the only row.
We're the most important people here.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.694
That's not true.
You're sitting right next to Brian Reyes.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.097
Very important designer.

11:08.134 --> 11:09.158
Hi.

11:09.735 --> 11:13.466
I'm just here for onion rings.
Isn't this fashion show hilarious?

11:15.041 --> 11:16.804
Oh. Can I get another drink, please?

11:16.842 --> 11:19.640
Hilda, this is very important
for my work.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.136
Oh.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.045
The key to sounding like
you have good taste

11:23.082 --> 11:24.709
is just hating everything.

11:24.750 --> 11:29.380
- Just call it "garish" or "ghoulish. "
- Ooh, yeah, "ghoulish" is good.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.387
Well, maybe
it's trying to be "prairie chic. "

11:32.425 --> 11:35.883
I mean, who am I to say?
Ugh, I just don't know.

11:41.267 --> 11:45.294
Oh. Wait a sec. That's kind of stunning.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.201
- Who did that?
- I would wear that.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.935
It's pretty great.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.141
- Excuse me.
Order up.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.746
Marisa? Hi. I loved your designs.

12:03.789 --> 12:07.589
<i>I'm Betty Suarez from Mode magazine
and I'm gonna make you a star.</i>

12:07.626 --> 12:09.025
Excuse me?

12:09.061 --> 12:10.790
Kidding, I can't make anyone a star,

12:10.830 --> 12:13.731
<i>but I do want to put you in the Mode's
Ten Designers to Watch Show.</i>

12:13.766 --> 12:16.633
Really? You can do that?

12:16.669 --> 12:19.160
No, I can't do that, either,
I'd have to convince some people.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.900
Let me try this again.

12:20.940 --> 12:24.899
I'm Betty Suarez and I'm gonna
try really hard to make you a star.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.912
- Yay!
- Yay!

12:29.615 --> 12:32.914
Marc, I found a new designer today,
Marisa Rowen,

12:32.952 --> 12:34.681
<i>and I want to pitch her
for the Mode show.</i>

12:34.720 --> 12:36.381
Ha! Suicide mission.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.880
You could maybe pitch a feature
to Wilhelmina, but a designer?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.552
No, she'll laugh you out of the room.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.086
I know that. So I've been thinking,
what if you were in the room with me?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.962
We could pitch her together
and share the credit.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.193
Why would I want to do that?

12:48.234 --> 12:50.134
Because Wilhelmina's got a slot to fill

12:50.169 --> 12:51.727
and you have been
trying to impress her

12:51.771 --> 12:54.137
and this designer is great.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.977
- You found this?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.046
- These are pretty...
- Great?

13:04.083 --> 13:05.607
I know. Marc, come on.

13:05.651 --> 13:09.883
If Wilhelmina says yes,
I look good, you look good, win-win.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.857
<i>Besides, the Mode show
could make this woman's career.</i>

13:12.892 --> 13:14.985
We could be
changing someone's life today.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.824
- Shouldn't that be enough?
- Okay, fine.

13:16.862 --> 13:20.696
But I'm the Wilhelmina expert,
so we do this my way.

13:41.754 --> 13:46.020
- Oh, my God, are you hurt?
- Hey. No.

13:46.058 --> 13:50.017
<i>I was just working on my runway walk
for the Mode show.</i>

13:50.362 --> 13:52.887
Oh. That's what that was.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.633
Don't be embarrassed,
I used to be a terrible walker,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.296
but now they let me
wear the final dress and everything.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.131
- Wow.
- I'm Heather, by the way.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.504
Hi, I'm Daniel.

14:02.541 --> 14:06.534
I know who you are. You're, like,
the head of the company, right?

14:07.146 --> 14:08.374
Guilty.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.347
I was just on the way to my fitting.
You want to come?

14:12.384 --> 14:13.908
I'd love that.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.991
Now, this isn't some chatty jam session
with the features nerds.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.989
Wilhelmina is very intense
when it comes to presenting fashion.

14:30.202 --> 14:34.298
First of all,
you must never look her in the eyes.

14:34.340 --> 14:38.470
And you must never look her
in the knees.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.740
She's very self-conscious
about her knees.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.644
If you must look at her,

14:42.681 --> 14:46.048
please direct your gaze
to her shins or her toes.

14:47.152 --> 14:49.780
- Is that really necessary?
- Yes.

14:49.822 --> 14:54.521
Now, since I will be doing the talking,
you will be Vanna White, like so.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.586
- Mmm-mmm. Mmm.
- Can I at least...

14:59.865 --> 15:01.833
I know you're gonna want to talk,
because you're Betty,

15:01.867 --> 15:03.198
and you love to talk.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.636
But the second you start yammering
about being true to yourself,

15:06.672 --> 15:10.699
Wilhelmina is gonna start texting
on her BlackBerry.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.404
And we will have lost her.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.583
All right.
As long as we share the credit, I'm fine.

15:18.617 --> 15:20.949
- Which design are we gonna lead with?
- Ah...

15:20.986 --> 15:23.546
Hey, Magic Marker, Chipotle.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.581
So, I hear
you're pitching some no-name

15:26.625 --> 15:28.024
<i>for the big Mode fashion show.</i>

15:28.060 --> 15:30.688
She's not a no-name,
she's about to be discovered.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.321
Okay, still not hearing a name.

15:32.364 --> 15:35.800
Anyway, Helen and I
just finished our fashion line,

15:35.834 --> 15:39.793
and I was hoping that maybe you could
show ours to Wilhelmina, too.

15:39.838 --> 15:40.896
Oh, my God.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.501
Mandy, I have seen your designs
and I love, love, love them.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.307
But it's Betty's name
on Wilhelmina's calendar,

15:47.346 --> 15:49.780
so you're gonna have to ask her.

15:55.921 --> 15:57.047
Um...

15:57.623 --> 15:59.887
I don't think that we're gonna have time

15:59.925 --> 16:03.122
to pitch both Marisa's designs
and yours.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.963
- What?
- What?

16:05.998 --> 16:09.161
Betty, when you see these designs,
you'll make time.

16:09.601 --> 16:12.035
Thank you so much.
I knew I could count on you.

16:12.071 --> 16:13.470
Yes! Yes!

16:16.175 --> 16:18.200
I didn't say "yes," did I?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.911
The only way to get Daniel on board
with the male models

16:20.946 --> 16:22.504
was to make him one and I'm worried

16:22.548 --> 16:24.948
that he's gonna bring down
the visual average of the show.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.384
- I know it.
- So, all we have to do is

16:27.419 --> 16:28.784
surround him
with the best-looking models

16:28.821 --> 16:30.311
and hope that
they cancel each other out.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.983
But all the best models
are already booked in shows.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.689
Hey, you, Flannel. What are you doing?

16:39.064 --> 16:41.862
I'm looking for Claire Meade.
Do you know her?

16:41.900 --> 16:43.197
Claire? Yes, unfortunately.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.669
But all the models
are supposed to be in their fitting,

16:45.704 --> 16:48.764
so forget about that skeleton
and go back to the Closet.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.442
I think you must
have me confused with someone.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.944
I'm not a model.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.371
Hmm.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.594
You are now.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.736
Grandpa, my new acting class
has real, working actors

17:21.807 --> 17:23.365
and I want them to be my friends.

17:23.409 --> 17:28.175
But how can I invite people over
with the crystal monster?

17:29.148 --> 17:33.346
You're just saying that because
you haven't seen it with the dimmer.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.084
Huh? Now is that classy, or what?

17:40.526 --> 17:42.926
Maybe it needs a little work. Ow!

17:42.961 --> 17:47.455
<i>Papi, if you want to keep futzing with it,
would you hire an electrician?</i>

17:47.499 --> 17:49.467
- Fine, fine.
- Hey, leave the man alone.

17:49.501 --> 17:53.597
Come on, let him play with his toy.
It makes him happy. It looks great.

17:53.639 --> 17:54.731
He wants to fix something,

17:54.773 --> 17:58.106
how about my salon chair
or the dryer valve?

17:58.143 --> 18:01.442
That place is falling apart.
I'm barely breaking even.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.505
Whoa. Wait a minute.
What, you're worried about money?

18:03.549 --> 18:05.312
Everything in that place
keeps breaking.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.148
That salon is turning into a money pit.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.250
Sometimes, I wish it would
just get struck by lightning

18:11.290 --> 18:13.588
and I could collect the insurance money
or something.

18:14.726 --> 18:18.025
I know, that's...
I shouldn't be talking like that.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.054
Hey, look. Come on.

18:20.365 --> 18:24.096
Things are gonna turn around,
all right? You'll see. Okay?

18:27.639 --> 18:29.470
- See you later.
- Bye.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.184
Hi, I'm supposed to get measured
or something?

18:44.223 --> 18:45.952
Yeah,
I'll be with you in a second.

18:45.991 --> 18:49.449
- First time model?
- Yeah. I'm actually kind of nervous.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.520
Aw. That's cute.

18:51.697 --> 18:55.133
Don't worry, stick with me,
I'll show you what to do.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.565
Did some print modeling
back in college. Daniel Meade.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.367
Meade? As in the name
on the building?

19:00.405 --> 19:02.600
So, Claire Meade's your mom?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.768
Yeah, but down here,
I'm just like everybody else.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.300
One of the models.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.245
So, Daniel, here's the poop.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.249
Uh, the final suit might be
the eensiest bit snug on you.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.183
That's okay. That's the style now.

19:13.218 --> 19:17.279
Um... Yes. Although, ideally,
you'd want someone a little leaner.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.620
Just for funzies.

19:20.792 --> 19:24.455
Whoo! Those are some tight little abs.
Heather, come here, feel this.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.827
- Pretty good, new guy.
- Thanks.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.825
Uh-huh. And biceps
to make me feel sick. And look at this.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.272
The most perfect tush
you've ever seen.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.299
All right,
now you guys are just making fun of me.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.642
You know, let's try you in the final suit.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.308
Guys, guys. Not to step on any toes,

19:44.349 --> 19:48.217
the designer specifically asked for me,
so let's just stick to the plan, right?

19:48.253 --> 19:49.686
Besides, I had fries for lunch.

19:49.721 --> 19:53.020
I'll be five pounds lighter tomorrow.
You'll see.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.057
Of course.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.654
Let's try this.

19:59.598 --> 20:05.468
Betty. And notice the hand-sewn
feather details in this piece.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.369
Beautiful, isn't it?

20:07.673 --> 20:09.163
Look at that.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.971
Betty.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.740
And this is her take on a garden dress.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.546
Note the 1940s influence,
but it's still very new.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.348
And you're sure
she's never shown before?

20:22.421 --> 20:26.858
Never in a major fashion show,
though technically, I did find her at...

20:27.326 --> 20:31.228
But she has been
in alternative showcases.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.025
But not at Bryant Park,

20:33.065 --> 20:36.933
<i>which means she's eligible
for Mode's Top Ten to Watch...</i>

20:45.677 --> 20:48.271
But look at this fabulous ruching.

20:54.119 --> 20:55.245
So what do you think?

20:55.287 --> 20:58.154
It's a little soft for my taste.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.853
But I haven't seen anything better,
so it's fine. She's in.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.022
Now, how did you find out
about her again?

21:08.066 --> 21:09.693
Actually, it was Betty who first...

21:09.735 --> 21:13.262
You know what? I really don't care,
just pick six looks and oversee them.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.138
You really stepped up to the plate
on this one.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.665
Great work, Marc.

21:22.814 --> 21:25.408
Uh... Wilhelmina?
I also had something to do...

21:25.450 --> 21:28.214
Yes, yes, yes.
Thanks for turning the pages, Betty.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.743
Now, get out.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.860
Hey! Partner!

21:44.903 --> 21:47.633
Look, Betty, I tried to tell Wilhelmina
that you found her.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.641
Oh, you did? You didn't try very hard.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.041
Quit being a credit hog.
Think about the designer.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.637
"We changed a life today.
Shouldn't that be enough?"

21:54.680 --> 21:56.841
So, what did Wilhelmina say
about my designs?

21:56.882 --> 22:00.079
- Ooh! Whoops, got to go.
- Bring it. Tell me what she said.

22:00.118 --> 22:03.576
Uh, she liked
the other designer's stuff better.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.590
More than mine? Did she say why?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.625
Amanda, we didn't actually
show her your work.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.056
It's great
that you want to pursue design,

22:13.098 --> 22:16.556
but you're so new at it,
and this was really important.

22:16.601 --> 22:19.001
Did you even look at my designs?

22:19.805 --> 22:25.675
Yes, and I thought
that they weren't quite ready.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.943
Marc loved them.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.511
You know, Betty, I don't know
why I even bothered asking you

22:34.553 --> 22:35.611
in the first place.

22:35.654 --> 22:38.020
What do you know about fashion?

22:41.593 --> 22:45.029
Ladies and germs, it's Fashion Week,
and you know what that means.

22:45.063 --> 22:46.121
I'm drunk.

22:46.164 --> 22:49.622
Kidding. Mostly.

22:49.668 --> 22:53.502
<i>It also means Mode will be unveiling
their Top Ten Designers to Watch.</i>

22:53.538 --> 22:55.563
I'm here with Marisa Rowen,

22:55.607 --> 22:58.405
a last-minute replacement,
plucked from obscurity.

22:58.443 --> 23:02.573
Marisa, tell me, how do you feel
to be shown at Bryant Park?

23:02.614 --> 23:05.276
I feel great. But I wouldn't even be here

23:05.317 --> 23:08.184
<i>without the talented young lady
from Mode who discovered me.</i>

23:08.220 --> 23:12.054
- And here she is! Marc St. James!
- Hey, Suzuks!

23:12.991 --> 23:14.959
Now, tell me, genius,
where'd you find this one?

23:14.993 --> 23:17.325
<i>- It's a great story.
Oh, come on.</i>

23:17.362 --> 23:21.230
He didn't even tell me
he was doing an interview. This stinks.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.133
What are you doing?

23:23.168 --> 23:25.227
Only two more pounds to lose
before the show tonight.

23:25.270 --> 23:29.502
Oh, right,
your big debut as a supermodel.

23:29.541 --> 23:33.705
Yeah. As long as I don't eat
anything today, I should be fine.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.545
But you know what? Come over here.
I need you to sit on my feet.

23:37.983 --> 23:41.817
You know, I found that designer.
That should be me on TV.

23:42.421 --> 23:48.087
If I were you,
I'd give Marc a piece of my mind.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.461
Oh. There's that little weasel now.

23:54.032 --> 23:57.968
Marc, I just saw you on TV.
So you're doing interviews now?

23:58.003 --> 24:01.803
I was doing you a favor.
Have you ever seen yourself on TV?

24:01.840 --> 24:03.364
Ding.

24:03.675 --> 24:05.768
- I was just being a friend. Yes.
- A friend?

24:05.811 --> 24:08.746
The whole point of this was for me to
prove to Wilhelmina that I have taste,

24:08.780 --> 24:12.614
and instead you're making it seem like
you found Marisa all by yourself.

24:12.651 --> 24:16.087
And what's worse is,
you hung me out to dry with Amanda.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.452
Your best friend.

24:17.489 --> 24:20.754
You knew her designs weren't ready
and you made me be the bad guy.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.760
- Betty...
- No! You want the credit, Marc?

24:22.794 --> 24:23.818
Do the work.

24:32.370 --> 24:34.804
Take the stick out.

24:36.074 --> 24:38.838
<i>What is this? Zoolander?
Walk like a man.</i>

24:41.079 --> 24:42.637
Shoulders back.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.979
Not all the way back.

24:45.717 --> 24:47.912
Try it again. One more time.

24:48.987 --> 24:52.047
Oh, stop. Just walk like...

24:56.228 --> 24:57.991
Walk like that guy.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.264
I can't believe Marc stole all your glory.

25:03.301 --> 25:07.499
<i>You know what would make you
feel better, mi hija? Some more light.</i>

25:09.174 --> 25:12.575
I hired that electrician,
now look how bright it is.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.668
Hmm? Huh?

25:16.681 --> 25:18.876
Not too short, Mom. I like it swoopy.

25:18.917 --> 25:21.852
He's trying out new looks
for his acting class.

25:21.887 --> 25:24.981
My professional acting class,
so I have to fit in.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.082
I'm all for fitting in, but I know actors

25:27.125 --> 25:29.389
and I don't want you coming home
with your nose pierced

25:29.427 --> 25:31.452
or a cigarette dangling
out of your mouth.

25:31.496 --> 25:32.588
Mom...

25:32.998 --> 25:36.525
<i>Mi hija, I'm sorry that Fashion Week
didn't turn out like you wanted.</i>

25:36.568 --> 25:39.594
I just thought that maybe I could
change some people's minds about me,

25:39.638 --> 25:42.630
but I guess I won't get the chance.

25:45.243 --> 25:46.733
<i>- Hello?
- Betty,</i>

25:46.778 --> 25:49.076
I am freaking out
about the show tonight.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.810
I'm not sure about the six looks.
Where are you?

25:51.850 --> 25:55.286
I'm in Queens, but I thought
that Marc was helping you.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.414
He was. Yeah,
Marc was wearing opera gloves today.

25:58.456 --> 26:00.924
I'm supposed to take
fashion advice from him?

26:01.493 --> 26:04.894
<i>You are the one that found me.
You are the one that I trust.</i>

26:05.330 --> 26:07.321
Is it cool if I come over there?

26:09.067 --> 26:11.535
Yeah, of course.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.637
It's a tragedy that these won't be seen
at Fashion Week.

26:16.675 --> 26:21.009
Ah, so they said "no. " Do I give up
every time someone tells me "no"?

26:21.046 --> 26:24.914
"No, Helen, don't do that.
No, Helen, don't sleep there.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.417
"No, Helen, that's not food. "

26:27.719 --> 26:29.414
We'll just show
at Fashion Week next year.

26:29.454 --> 26:31.581
And until then,
we'll all live together,

26:31.623 --> 26:34.558
like one giant sexy family.

26:37.462 --> 26:42.195
Ugh. Hi. Need some help?

26:43.768 --> 26:46.931
See? That's what real friends do.

26:46.972 --> 26:50.305
It's not like Betty,
who's up on her big stocky high horse,

26:50.342 --> 26:52.936
telling me that I'm not good enough.

26:52.978 --> 26:56.846
Mandy, don't be so hard on Betty.

26:57.816 --> 27:02.446
Look, real designers
spend years schooling and training,

27:02.487 --> 27:05.081
and you did this in, like, one week.

27:06.591 --> 27:09.059
Marc, why didn't you say anything?

27:10.729 --> 27:12.924
'Cause I don't like to see you sad.

27:15.133 --> 27:19.570
Betty was telling the truth. I'm sorry.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.577
All the garments are steamed
and hung in the salon,

27:31.616 --> 27:35.382
and in a few hours,
they will be the talk of Fashion Week.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.945
You are a lifesaver, you know that?

27:41.559 --> 27:45.256
<i>- Amanda?
- Hey. Your papi let me in.</i>

27:45.296 --> 27:47.161
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.

27:47.232 --> 27:50.030
- Um, this is Marisa.
- Hi.

27:52.137 --> 27:55.334
Listen, Betty,
I'm so sorry that I yelled at you before.

27:55.373 --> 27:58.536
I just keep seeing you and Marc
move up in the world,

27:58.576 --> 28:01.067
and I feel like
I'm being left behind or something.

28:01.112 --> 28:04.047
And I thought being a designer
would be my big ticket.

28:04.082 --> 28:07.176
- It's so stupid.
- It's not stupid.

28:07.218 --> 28:10.449
- Betty, do you smell smoke?
- Yes. What is that?

28:10.488 --> 28:13.252
Out! Hey, get out!
Get out! Everybody out!

28:13.291 --> 28:15.486
- Bobby, what's going on?
- Get out of here! The house is on fire!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.392
What? Oh, my God!

28:50.829 --> 28:53.889
Well, the house
is mostly just smoke damaged,

28:53.932 --> 28:56.696
but the salon is pretty bad.

28:57.068 --> 29:02.005
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
This is my business.

29:02.040 --> 29:07.000
- How did this happen?
- They don't know. I'm so sorry, Hilda.

29:07.045 --> 29:10.446
Look, the most important thing
is that no one's hurt.

29:14.385 --> 29:17.582
Hey, Marc, I can't really talk right now.
I'm in the middle of an emergency.

29:17.622 --> 29:21.183
No, I'm in the middle of an emergency.
It's almost time for runway.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.421
Is Marisa with you?
Where are the dresses?

29:23.495 --> 29:25.759
Oh, my God! The dresses!

29:32.537 --> 29:35.768
Uh-uh. Celery only. Fewer calories.

29:36.141 --> 29:41.010
Honestly, I don't know
how you guys do this. I am starving.

29:42.113 --> 29:46.550
He is so lucky
he can eat like that.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.784
I wish I was 25 again.

29:51.122 --> 29:55.923
- Why, how old are you?
- Twenty-six. So over the hill.

29:56.361 --> 30:00.661
So, listen,
there's a party after the show tonight

30:00.698 --> 30:03.861
and I was thinking
maybe you and I can go together.

30:03.902 --> 30:08.464
You're so sweet.
But Tyler and I are having dinner after.

30:11.276 --> 30:12.300
Oh.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.836
But you can meet us
at the after-afterparty at, like, 3:00.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.815
In the morning? Wow. Um...

30:20.518 --> 30:22.418
Probably just take a rain check.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.145
Um, I'm gonna
go get dressed. It's getting...

30:26.291 --> 30:29.852
Oh. Back pain? My dad gets that, too.

30:40.438 --> 30:41.632
It's not your fault.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.733
You know, I had a feeling
this was all a little too good to be true.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.801
No, stop. Don't talk like that.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.972
I just can't believe I got so close.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.709
Um, you guys?
Not to rain on your little pity party,

30:51.749 --> 30:54.183
but these are actually still kind of fab.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.016
Amanda, you're making it worse.

30:56.054 --> 30:57.919
Okay, I may not be a designer,

30:57.956 --> 31:00.686
but I still know fashion,
and this is really good.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.989
Look at the hemline. It's ruined.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.224
Oh, excuse me,
can I borrow that for a second?

31:08.266 --> 31:10.700
Amanda! Amanda! Stop.

31:12.036 --> 31:15.005
Thank you. See?

31:16.741 --> 31:20.302
- I don't know.
- Okay, you just have to see it in action.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.082
Hot, right? I totally styled it.

31:25.483 --> 31:27.451
- Wow.
- What?

31:27.886 --> 31:32.789
Well, fashion is trending
towards distressed looks.

31:32.824 --> 31:35.850
What are you saying?
We can still show these?

31:36.594 --> 31:38.960
I can't believe I'm saying this, but yes.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.864
I'm gonna call Marc and tell him
that you're on your way now.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.992
You're not coming?

31:43.034 --> 31:46.128
Aunt Betty, the fire is out
and there is nothing left to see here.

31:46.170 --> 31:49.196
<i>And if you don't go to the Mode show,
that'll be two tragedies today.</i>

31:49.240 --> 31:51.572
So, no. You're going.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.942
- Cute.
- I know, right?

31:53.978 --> 31:55.502
- Isn't it sexy?
- Yeah, I like it.

32:13.031 --> 32:15.329
You need to find someone else
to wear this.

32:15.366 --> 32:16.492
Okay.

32:33.017 --> 32:34.450
Took you long enough
to get here.

32:34.485 --> 32:37.215
I was this close to having
the grandmother of all hissy fits.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.745
Now, show me the dresses.

32:42.860 --> 32:47.661
- Amanda! Not while she's in the dress.
- Oh, sorry.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.691
On the phone
you said we could still use these.

32:50.735 --> 32:53.795
Has Wilhelmina seen these yet?
She's gonna murder somebody.

32:53.838 --> 32:59.003
Oh, here, it's coming. I can feel it.
It's the hissy fit. I'm having a hissy fit.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.369
What the hell is going on?

33:27.005 --> 33:29.030
Willie, I swear
I had nothing to do with this.

33:29.073 --> 33:32.565
There was a fire, and, well,
you have to ask Betty. It's Betty's fault.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.544
Betty's the one
who found the designer to begin with.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.376
- Oh, great, now I get the credit.
- Shh!

33:37.482 --> 33:41.077
If you are in any way dissatisfied,
I will shut this down right now.

33:41.119 --> 33:42.746
Oh,
stop your prattling, Marc.

33:42.787 --> 33:44.846
You know I hate 11 th hour surprises,

33:44.889 --> 33:48.689
but I actually think
these dresses work better like this.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.061
Couldn't agree more.

33:58.636 --> 34:01.901
Okay, everybody, back to work!
Show in 10 minutes!

34:33.771 --> 34:36.501
Oh! Hi, hons. You'll never guess what.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.702
I met this guy tonight
and we're getting married.

34:39.844 --> 34:40.902
- You are?
- Yeah.

34:40.945 --> 34:42.742
Things were never gonna work out
between us.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.907
And things with me and Guillermo
are so good.

34:44.949 --> 34:48.385
Which is a good thing, because
he came this close to being deported.

34:48.418 --> 34:52.286
Oh, Guillermo, there you are!
Look. Hi, cutie! Darling!

34:54.992 --> 34:57.927
Look. Isn't he cute?
Those are my friends.

34:59.297 --> 35:02.789
Wow. I guess
that's the end of my design team.

35:04.702 --> 35:07.262
Well, you're not a designer.

35:07.305 --> 35:11.105
But, Amanda,
the accessories, the hair...

35:11.142 --> 35:13.633
You really pulled this together.

35:15.379 --> 35:17.279
Maybe you're a stylist.

35:17.315 --> 35:18.942
Do I have to go to school?
How do I become one?

35:18.983 --> 35:21.213
Just call yourself a stylist.

35:22.086 --> 35:25.852
I am a stylist.

35:27.558 --> 35:28.957
Rachel Zoe can suck it!

35:28.993 --> 35:31.791
There's a new skinny bitch
in town. What?

35:33.731 --> 35:36.825
- Are they clapping?
- Yes. And it's all for you.

35:36.901 --> 35:40.393
Oh! Last dress. Go, go.
Have fun, go. Have fun.

35:47.178 --> 35:48.805
So, for what it's worth,

35:48.846 --> 35:51.212
I might have gotten a little carried away
during Fashion Week,

35:51.249 --> 35:53.274
- trying to impress Wilhelmina.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:53.317 --> 35:56.184
But it is so hard
being a new editor around here.

35:56.220 --> 35:59.212
- Oh, really? What's that like?
- It's real... Oh.

36:02.593 --> 36:04.493
So, anyway, I'm sorry.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.157
Well,

36:07.965 --> 36:09.990
I appreciate the apology.

36:15.139 --> 36:17.903
And I shouldn't have stolen your credit.

36:21.445 --> 36:22.707
But I learned from the best.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.578
<i>Wasn't
that fabulous, Suzuki?</i>

36:24.615 --> 36:28.051
<i>Marisa Rowen,
another Wilhelmina Slater discovery.</i>

36:28.486 --> 36:30.386
<i>Wait till you see what's next.</i>

36:30.421 --> 36:34.152
<i>- The menswear collection, a Mode first.
- I'm all over it.</i>

36:38.696 --> 36:41.290
Marisa Rowen. I found her.

36:44.335 --> 36:47.236
There you are.
I just came by to wish you luck.

36:47.271 --> 36:49.239
Honey, shouldn't you be dressed?

36:50.508 --> 36:53.409
I guess my modeling days
are pretty much over.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.743
- What changed your mind?
- I realized I'm not 25 anymore.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.181
That's good.
I knew you when you were 25.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.345
You were aimless, arrogant, entitled.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.951
Wait, this is helping how?

37:06.357 --> 37:07.984
Look at you now.

37:08.092 --> 37:11.118
You know who you are,
what you want from life.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.463
You're kind and loyal and loving.

37:14.899 --> 37:18.027
And I'd much rather
spend time with this Daniel.

37:18.202 --> 37:19.669
Thanks, Mom.

37:20.104 --> 37:22.334
I'm just sorry you won't have
the thrill of seeing your son

37:22.373 --> 37:23.806
walk down the runway.

37:27.111 --> 37:28.203
Mmm.

37:35.553 --> 37:36.747
Go.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.482
Come on. Go, go.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.429
Oh, God. Thank God for you, Bobby.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.731
If you hadn't have been there
to get everybody out of the house...

37:51.769 --> 37:53.964
I don't even
want to think about it.

37:54.005 --> 37:58.601
Yeah, that was lucky, you know,
but maybe now you get what you want.

37:58.643 --> 37:59.769
What?

38:00.945 --> 38:02.606
I'm saying,
now that the salon burnt down,

38:02.647 --> 38:05.980
you'll probably get
the insurance money. It's good.

38:56.467 --> 38:57.729
Mrs. Meade?

38:59.236 --> 39:02.262
I'm Tyler Venton,
from Stickney, South Dakota.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.603
I know who you are.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.578
That was some tip you left me
back in Stickney.

39:10.047 --> 39:13.175
I kept wondering
why you'd leave so much money.

39:13.217 --> 39:15.913
And when I asked my parents
about you, they got all quiet,

39:15.953 --> 39:18.513
and so I started thinking

39:18.556 --> 39:21.457
that maybe this has to do
with my adoption or something.

39:24.328 --> 39:25.795
And, well...

39:27.631 --> 39:29.292
Are you my mother?

39:31.469 --> 39:32.959
Tyler, I...

39:37.641 --> 39:39.666
I don't know what to say.

39:45.649 --> 39:46.809
Yeah.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.958
I've pictured...

40:00.998 --> 40:03.193
I've pictured this in my head
a million times,

40:03.234 --> 40:05.566
and now that it's here...

40:05.736 --> 40:09.467
You must have so many questions,
but I can't do this tonight.

40:09.507 --> 40:10.974
- Can I put you up at a nice hotel?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:11.008 --> 40:12.908
Will you stay in town?

40:13.844 --> 40:19.680
Uh, and, Tyler, until I can figure out how
to tell the people in my life about you,

40:19.717 --> 40:21.912
can we just keep this between us?

40:21.952 --> 40:23.351
Yes, ma'am.

40:26.690 --> 40:30.626
- What did he want?
- Oh, I think he was lost.

40:31.495 --> 40:34.430
I'm glad
I don't have to see that guy again.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.777
Wilhelmina? Excuse me.

40:47.812 --> 40:52.272
I just wanted to say thank you
for putting Marisa in the show.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.547
Oh. Looking for a pat on the back,
are we?

40:55.586 --> 40:57.645
No. That's not what I meant.

40:57.688 --> 41:00.156
Betty, you had a success tonight.

41:00.591 --> 41:01.649
But if you found that designer,

41:01.692 --> 41:05.856
you should have pitched her yourself,
instead of hiding behind Marc.

41:06.831 --> 41:12.360
Well, it's just that, historically, you
haven't really been a fan of my taste.

41:12.403 --> 41:15.065
No, you were afraid.

41:16.273 --> 41:19.902
You think I'm scary?
Try working under Fey Sommers.

41:20.511 --> 41:24.447
For 20 years, she belittled
every fashion choice I ever made,

41:24.482 --> 41:28.441

41:36.494 --> 41:43.024
