WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.342
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:11.045 --> 00:13.614
- I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.
- DO WHAT?

00:13.714 --> 00:15.783
THIS THERAPY.
I--

00:15.883 --> 00:19.187
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S LEADING ANYWHERE,
THAT'S ALL.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.655
WHERE DO YOU
WANT IT TO LEAD, ALEX?

00:21.755 --> 00:25.893
SOMEPLACE WHERE I FEEL
LESS SHITTY ABOUT MYSELF.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.428
I GOT A CALL FROM
MY WING COMMANDER,

00:27.528 --> 00:31.399
AND HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF I'M READY FOR ACTIVE DUTY.

00:33.934 --> 00:37.405
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE READY.

00:44.178 --> 00:48.116
OH, WELL, I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD SALUTE YOU.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.551
AT EASE, DOC.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.922
THIS IS GONNA BE
MY LAST TIME,

00:55.022 --> 00:56.590
FOR A WHILE ANYWAY.

00:56.690 --> 00:57.425
I'M HERE TO SETTLE UP.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.760
AND I NEED SOMETHING
FROM YOU.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.028
MMM.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.431
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COFFEE?

01:03.531 --> 01:04.798
SURE.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.602
( theme music playing )

01:27.888 --> 01:29.290
I KNOW I'M NOT
GIVING YOU ANY NOTICE.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.058
YOU WANT ME TO PAY
FOR THE NEXT SESSION TOO?

01:31.159 --> 01:33.093
NO NO, THAT'S FINE.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.062
SORRY THE GRAVY TRAIN
IS ENDING HERE, DOC.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.064
THAT'S OKAY.
SO WHY ARE YOU LEAVING?

01:37.165 --> 01:39.167
I GOT YOU CURIOUS, HUH?

01:39.267 --> 01:41.802
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
MY SQUADRON COMMANDER
CALLED ME?

01:41.902 --> 01:43.304
MM-HMM.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.772
WELL, LAST WEEK
THEY FINALLY
BROUGHT ME IN.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.807
NOW I THOUGHT THEY
WANTED TO EASE ME
BACK IN, BUT NO.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.943
THEY NEED ME TO TRAIN
THE NEXT WAVE OF PILOTS
FOR THEIR DEPLOYMENT,

01:50.043 --> 01:51.279
GET THEM READY
TO FLY ASAP.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.647
ALWAYS PLAYING CATCH-UP
IN THIS WAR.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.249
SO WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THEM?

01:55.349 --> 01:58.719
I SAID, "FUCK YOU!
I'M 39 YEARS OLD,
IN THE PRIME OF MY LIFE

01:58.819 --> 02:01.088
AND ONE OF THE MOST DECORATED
FIGHTER PILOTS IN THE NAVY.

02:01.189 --> 02:04.158
NO NO, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA PUT ME OUT TO PASTURE,
NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.126
GET YOURSELF ANOTHER BOY."

02:06.227 --> 02:07.395
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAID TO THEM?

02:07.495 --> 02:09.897
WELL, NOT REALLY,
BUT I THOUGHT IT.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.865
ACTUALLY WHAT I SAID WAS,

02:11.965 --> 02:14.402
"YES, SIR. HOWEVER I CAN BE
OF SERVICE TO YOU, SIR."

02:14.502 --> 02:16.937
AND I REPORTED FOR DUTY
THE NEXT DAY.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.406
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?

02:18.506 --> 02:21.342
I CAN ONLY GET AWAY
WITH THAT BULLSHIT WITH YOU.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.244
WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW
WHY YOU COME HERE.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.182
SO WHAT'S IT LIKE
BEING BACK AT BASE?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.717
IT'S BEEN A REAL TRIP.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.353
MOST OF THESE GUYS ARE
RIGHT OUT OF TOPGUN,
COCKY AS HELL.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.788
WHEN THEY LOOK IN MY EYES,
THEY KNOW I'VE BEEN PLACES

02:34.888 --> 02:37.291
THEY COULDN'T CONJURE UP
IN THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.927
MAKES THEM THINK TWICE
BEFORE FUCKING WITH ME.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.829
MMM.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.464
SO, TRAINING YOUNG PILOTS--

02:43.564 --> 02:46.434
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN
SEE YOURSELF DOING?

02:46.534 --> 02:50.037
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE IN ANOTHER CONTEXT.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.039
BUT THIS IS SET UP TO FAIL.

02:52.139 --> 02:55.142
THERE'S NO WAY THESE KIDS
ARE GONNA BE READY FOR COMBAT
MISSIONS IN A MONTH.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.677
I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.280
I'M TAKING THEM THROUGH
TACTICAL SITUATIONS.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.881
SOME OF THEM ARE DOING
BETTER THAN OTHERS,

03:00.981 --> 03:03.284
BUT WHEN YOU'RE UP IN THE AIR,
IT'S READ AND REACT.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.219
READ, REACT-- LIKE A MACHINE.
NO THINKING.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.820
IT'S LIKE SPLIT-SECOND
DECISIONS

03:06.920 --> 03:09.757
THAT CAN COST
THOUSANDS OF LIVES,
INCLUDING THEIR OWN.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.761
MOST OF THESE KIDS, THEY
LOOK AT ME ON THE SIMULATORS
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WHOA!"

03:13.861 --> 03:16.096
WELL, THEY'RE BLOWN AWAY.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.798
THAT MUST FEEL REALLY GREAT.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.270
EH. I OVERHEARD A COUPLE
OF THESE KIDS TALKING SHIT
ABOUT ME,

03:22.370 --> 03:24.705
SAYING THAT I MIGHT BE GOOD
ON THE SIMULATORS

03:24.805 --> 03:26.574
BUT THEY'D KICK MY ASS
ON THE OBSTACLE COURSE.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.342
CALLED ME OLD MAN,
ALL THAT BULLSHIT.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.379
WELL, HEY,
I CALLED THEIR BLUFF.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.781
CHECK THIS OUT:
NOW THE DRILL IS CALLED
THE GAUNTLET.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.351
IT'S A FIVE-MILE RUN THROUGH
DENSE WOODS AND SAND TRAPS

03:37.451 --> 03:40.454
AND ROPE-AND-BARRIER HURDLES,
BALANCE BEAMS

03:40.554 --> 03:43.491
AND A MAZE.
NOW AFTER ALL THAT,

03:43.591 --> 03:46.527
HA HA,
THERE'S THE HELO-DUNKER.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.096
NOW THE HELO-DUNKER
IS LIKE THIS GIANT--

03:49.196 --> 03:50.531
IT LOOKS LIKE A BEER CAN.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.300
IT'S BASICALLY
A CRASH SIMULATOR.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.769
WE HIT THE WATER HARD,
UPSIDE DOWN, STRAPPED IN TIGHT.

03:55.869 --> 03:59.340
AND WE HAVE TO GET OUT
WITH ALMOST NO OXYGEN.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.642
WE'RE IN FULL GEAR--
HELMET, SPACESUIT,

04:01.742 --> 04:04.111
G-SUIT, GLOVES,
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.479
NOW THERE ARE
FOUR IMMERSIONS.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.948
THE LAST TWO,
THE WATER'S DARK.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.950
IT'S LIKE A NIGHT LANDING.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.220
AND A LOT OF THESE KIDS,
THEY GET DISORIENTED AND START
FLIPPING THE FUCK OUT.

04:13.321 --> 04:16.123
SO WE HAVE TO RESCUE THEM.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.858
IT'S TOUGH.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.061
IT SEPARATES
THE MEN FROM THE BOYS,
LET ME TELL YOU.

04:21.161 --> 04:24.632
SO, DOC, HOW DO
YOU THINK I DID?

04:24.732 --> 04:25.699
( chuckles )

04:25.799 --> 04:28.369
DO I REALLY
HAVE TO GUESS, ALEX?

04:28.469 --> 04:30.871
( laughs )
TOUCHE.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.342
I NEVER PANIC.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.209
I'M AT HOME DOWN THERE
IN THE DARK,

04:36.310 --> 04:37.945
SWIMMING FOR MY LIFE.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.653
AND NOT ONLY DID I BEAT
ALL THEIR ASSES,

04:45.753 --> 04:48.722
I CAME WITHIN TWO SECONDS
OF A BASE RECORD.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.991
NOT BAD FOR A BROKEN-DOWN
OLD PILOT, HUH?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.861
HUH?
COME ON, PAUL.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.664
OKAY, SO MY SQUADRON
COMMANDER CALLS ME BACK UP
TO HIS OFFICE.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.999
THIS TIME ALL THE BRASS
WERE THERE

04:59.099 --> 05:02.436
AND THEY WANT TO KNOW
IF I'M INTERESTED IN
GOING BACK TO ACTIVE DUTY.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.605
IF I AM,
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH

05:04.705 --> 05:06.740
A MODIFIED BASIC TRAINING
AT PENSACOLA,

05:06.840 --> 05:08.442
A BATTERY OF TESTS--
PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL--

05:08.542 --> 05:10.678
JUST TO MAKE SURE
I'VE RECOVERED.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.781
SO I SAID,
"BRING IT ON, BABY!

05:13.881 --> 05:15.583
I'M READY FOR ANYTHING!"

05:17.250 --> 05:19.219
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.389
WELL, A LITTLE, I GUESS.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.890
I SHOULDN'T BE,

05:22.990 --> 05:25.359
BUT I SUPPOSE IT WAS
ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.461
BUT YOU THINK IT'S
TOO FAST, RIGHT?

05:27.561 --> 05:29.597
DO YOU THINK IT'S
TOO FAST?

05:32.966 --> 05:35.436
DOC, YOU HAVE NO IDEA

05:35.536 --> 05:37.605
HOW GOOD IT FEELS
TO BE USEFUL AGAIN?

05:37.705 --> 05:40.741
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I THINK THAT'S BEEN
THE REAL PROBLEM.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.976
I'VE BEEN SITTING AROUND
FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.345
I'M A DOER, NOT A TALKER,

05:45.446 --> 05:47.581
SO ALL OF THIS-- THAT'S OVER.
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.550
SO HERE'S WHAT
I NEED FROM YOU:

05:49.650 --> 05:51.685
YOU'RE GONNA GET A CALL
FROM ONE OF YOUR COMPATRIOTS.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.587
HE'S A NAVY DOCTOR
NAMED CONNELL.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.355
HE'S GONNA BE
CHECKING UP ON ME.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.190
YOU TOLD THE NAVY
YOU WERE SEEING ME?

05:57.290 --> 05:58.859
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
PROFESSIONAL SUICIDE.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.695
YEAH, THEY CAUGHT WIND
THAT I HAD LEFT THE HOUSE

06:01.795 --> 06:03.397
AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW
IF IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO

06:03.497 --> 06:04.998
WITH THE BOMBING
AND THE AFTERMATH.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.200
SO I TOLD THEM
I'D BEEN DOING SOME
COUNSELING WITH YOU--

06:07.300 --> 06:10.237
YOU KNOW, MY MARRIAGE--
AND THAT I WAS FIT AS A FIDDLE.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.439
DO YOU FEEL
FIT AS A FIDDLE?

06:11.539 --> 06:13.641
PAUL, DON'T FUCK
WITH ME ON THIS.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.209
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
MY CAREER NOW.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.111
JUST TELL HIM
ALL GOOD THINGS.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.080
PLUS, THE NAVY NEEDS ME.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.950
YOU THINK THEY CAN AFFORD
TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE ME
JUST PISSING AROUND?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.585
JUST TELL HIM I'M READY.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.520
WELL, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT
WHETHER YOU ARE READY OR NOT.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.156
HEY, CUT THE CRAP!
I NEED THIS.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.826
YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A VERY
DIFFICULT POSITION, ALEX.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.262
WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT MORE
THAN MICHAELA.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.031
YOU DON'T EXPECT ME
TO LIE, DO YOU?

06:38.131 --> 06:40.534
OKAY, PHYSICALLY I'M FINE.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.503
I HAD THE HEART ATTACK
ALMOST FOUR MONTHS AGO.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.605
ALL THE CARDIOLOGISTS
SAY THAT--

06:44.705 --> 06:47.608
THEY'RE AMAZED BY MY RECOVERY.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.342
BUT WHAT ABOUT
EMOTIONALLY, ALEX?

06:49.443 --> 06:51.311
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOURSELF
BACK IN AN AIRPLANE

06:51.411 --> 06:53.013
FLYING A MISSION
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.516
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
THE MADRASA THING?

06:55.616 --> 06:59.219
LOOK, THE MADRASA THING IS
THE CRISIS THAT BROUGHT YOU
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.455
ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU'RE READY

07:01.555 --> 07:04.592
TO PUT YOURSELF IN THAT KIND
OF SITUATION AGAIN?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.960
NO NO NO, LISTEN.
TERRORISTS HIDE AMONG CIVILIANS.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.596
IT'S A COMMON TACTIC.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.164
IT'S THEIR FAULT
IF THERE'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE,
NOT OURS.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.867
THEY'RE THE ONES PUTTING THEIR
WOMEN AND CHILDREN AT RISK.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.936
LET'S PUT ASIDE THE QUESTION
OF WHO'S AT FAULT

07:16.036 --> 07:17.705
OR WHO ISN'T.

07:17.805 --> 07:21.141
COULD YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF
IF YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE

07:21.241 --> 07:23.276
FOR MORE
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES?

07:23.376 --> 07:24.812
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.648
ALEX, YOU GAVE
YOURSELF A HEART ATTACK
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.050
CAN YOU HONESTLY TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT WORRIED,

07:30.150 --> 07:32.653
THAT YOU'RE NOT SCARED
THAT YOUR GUILT
WILL LEAD TO--

07:32.753 --> 07:35.388
GUILT IS NOT AN ISSUE
FOR A PILOT IN A TIME OF WAR.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.857
WE'RE NOT TRAINED
TO THINK THAT WAY.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.292
I'M NOT ASKING
WHAT YOU THINK.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.995
I'M ASKING YOU TO
TELL ME WHAT YOU FEEL.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.064
AND I'M TELLING YOU
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.833
( cell phone buzzes )

07:45.933 --> 07:48.068
LET ME JUST SEE WHO THIS IS.
SORRY.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.073
HEY.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.677
IT WENT FINE.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.181
YEAH YEAH,
THEY DID ASK ME.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.751
NO.

08:03.851 --> 08:07.821
NO, I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

08:07.921 --> 08:11.258
MICHAELA, LET ME GO, ALL RIGHT?
I'M WITH SOMEBODY RIGHT NOW.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.862
YEAH, I WILL.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.464
YEAH, BYE.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.099
SORRY.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.302
SHE WANTED TO KNOW
HOW THE MEETING WITH
THE BRASS WENT.

08:22.402 --> 08:25.706
YOU KNOW, SHE'S TOTALLY
OBSESSED WITH ME FLYING AGAIN.
YOU KNOW THAT.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.776
WHY DO YOU THINK SHE'S SO
ANXIOUS FOR YOU TO FLY AGAIN?

08:28.876 --> 08:32.145
WELL, MY LITTLE SABBATICAL
UPSET HER SENSE OF ORDER.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.548
IF IT WAS A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.383
I WAS TAKING A BREAK,
WHATEVER.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.852
I TOLD YOU WE WERE
HAVING DINNER TO DISCUSS
ME COMING BACK HOME.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.454
YEAH, WELL, THE HEAT IS ON.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.857
I DON'T THINK I CAN
FIGHT IT ANY LONGER.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.260
- PLUS IT'S WHAT
EVERYBODY WANTS.
- EVERYONE?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.797
EVERYBODY--
MY FATHER INCLUDED.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.599
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE AND MICHAELA,
THEY'RE UNITED IN EVERYTHING.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.702
WHY IS YOU FATHER SO ANXIOUS
FOR YOU TO FLY AGAIN?

08:56.169 --> 08:58.872
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
DEEP BEHIND IT, PAUL.

08:58.972 --> 09:02.475
HE THINKS I NEED
TO GET BACK TO MY JOB.
IT'S WHAT A MAN DOES.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.144
AND HE'S RIGHT.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.880
CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW YOU GOT TO THAT
CONCLUSION?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.283
ARE YOU SURE YOU
HAVE TIME FOR THAT?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.319
- 'CAUSE I JUST CAME BY--
- WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.287
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING
IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT,

09:14.387 --> 09:17.124
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO PUSH ME FOR AN ASSESSMENT.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.965
IT'S HOT AS HELL IN HERE.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.641
UM...

09:36.409 --> 09:38.411
WE HAD A PARTY
FOR MY SON,

09:38.511 --> 09:40.113
A BIRTHDAY PARTY...

09:42.449 --> 09:44.217
AND EVERYTHING
BECAME CLEAR.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.857
I TOLD YOU MY SON ROY
IS A SPECIAL KID.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.491
- HAVE I TOLD YOU THAT?
- MM-HMM.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.093
HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO NEED FRIENDS.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.428
SO WHEN WE ASKED HIM
WHAT KIND OF PARTY
HE WANTED,

09:55.528 --> 09:57.765
HE SAID ONLY FAMILY.
I SUPPORTED THAT.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.634
I DIDN'T WANT TO FORCE
HIM TO BE ANYTHING HE ISN'T.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.970
SO ALL THE UNCLES AND AUNTS
CAME AND THE COUSINS,

10:03.070 --> 10:04.838
AND EVERYBODY WAS
IN A GOOD MOOD.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.539
MY DAD,
HE GOT THERE EARLY.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.575
HE'S ESTABLISHING
AND SETTING UP EVERYTHING

10:08.676 --> 10:10.477
AND ACTING LIKE
HE OWNS THE PLACE,

10:10.577 --> 10:12.312
ORDERING MY WIFE AROUND.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.582
I COULD TELL HE HAD BEEN
THERE A LOT SINCE I LEFT.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.718
AND THE BITCH HE MARRIED,
SHE WAS THERE TOO,

10:17.818 --> 10:20.553
IN THE KITCHEN COOKING
AS IF MY MOTHER
NEVER EXISTED.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.390
IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE SHIT,

10:23.490 --> 10:26.894
LIKE A STRANGER
IN MY OWN HOME.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.698
MY FATHER SEES ME
AND HE GIVES ME ONE
OF THOSE COLD SMILES.

10:30.798 --> 10:34.301
"ALEX, NICE OF YOU
TO MAKE IT. "

10:37.404 --> 10:40.774
I COULD TELL HE HAD
A WILD HAIR UP HIS ASS
ABOUT SOMETHING.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.242
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DIDN'T ASK.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.177
'CAUSE WHEN HE WANTS
TO SHARE, HE SHARES.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.813
AND THEN HE'S ALL OVER ME,

10:45.913 --> 10:48.215
AND I'M IN NO RUSH
TO GET THERE.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.352
BUT HE IS GREAT
WITH ROY, THOUGH.
THEY CONNECT.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.655
SOMEHOW IT'S EASY FOR THEM.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.158
DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WEREN'T
CONNECTING WITH ROY?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.496
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE
A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.999
WE DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH TIME ALONE.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.668
HAVE YOU SEEN A LOT OF HIM
SINCE YOU LEFT HOME?

11:08.769 --> 11:12.840
ONCE, TWICE. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU CONSIDER A LOT.

11:12.940 --> 11:16.009
DID HE EVER ASK WHY
YOU WEREN'T LIVING
AT HOME ANYMORE?

11:16.109 --> 11:19.412
YEAH.
I TOLD HIM HIS DAD

11:19.512 --> 11:20.981
WAS ON A SPECIAL MISSION.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.316
I MEAN, I'M GONE
HALF THE TIME.
HE'S USED TO IT.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.686
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I THINK IT'S BEEN
A RELIEF FOR HIM.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.389
WHY WOULD IT BE A RELIEF
FOR HIS DAD TO BE AWAY?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.058
WELL...

11:32.960 --> 11:35.528
HE WAS LOOSE AS HELL
AT THE PARTY.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.331
I MEAN, HE'S RUNNING AROUND,
HE'S PLAYING WITH HIS COUSINS,

11:38.431 --> 11:39.900
HE'S TALKING
TO EVERYBODY.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.568
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM.
HE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.703
HE WAS OPEN,
HE WAS OUTGOING.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.073
IT'S LIKE HE BLOOMED
IN MY ABSENCE.

11:46.173 --> 11:49.142
WELL, NOT BLOOMED.
JEEZ, HE'S NOT A FUCKING FLOWER.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.778
IT'S LIKE
HE SPREAD HIS WINGS.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.846
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
IT WAS LIKE.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.249
MAYBE HE WAS HAPPY
BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE,

11:56.349 --> 12:00.220
MAYBE BECAUSE HE WAS
JUST GLAD TO SEE YOU.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.756
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
FLYING, ALEX,

12:02.856 --> 12:04.958
BECAUSE YOU MAKE NO BONES
WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE FACT

12:05.058 --> 12:07.027
THAT THE NAVY
REALLY NEEDS YOU,

12:07.127 --> 12:09.830
THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.865
YET WHEN IT COMES TO
TALKING ABOUT YOUR SON--

12:11.965 --> 12:14.234
PAUL, PAUL,
SLOW THE FUCK DOWN.

12:14.334 --> 12:18.471
THE BOY WAS HAVING
A GREAT DAY BEFORE
I EVER GOT THERE.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.340
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE PROJECTING

12:20.440 --> 12:23.476
YOUR OWN FEELINGS ABOUT
YOUR FATHER ONTO YOUR SON?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.278
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

12:25.378 --> 12:27.247
WELL, THAT YOU MIGHT BE
DOING BETTER YOURSELF--

12:27.347 --> 12:30.017
SPREADING YOUR WINGS TOO
IF HE WASN'T THERE,

12:30.117 --> 12:32.786
IF HE WASN'T IN YOUR WAY,
SO TO SPEAK.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.155
NO, DOC,
MY BEING THERE

12:35.255 --> 12:37.657
DIDN'T MAKE THE KID
HAPPY THAT DAY.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.827
JUST THE OPPOSITE IN FACT.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.463
HOW? WHAT HAPPENED?

12:43.563 --> 12:46.533
I TOLD YOU ROY WAS
OBSESSED WITH CHESS, RIGHT?

12:46.633 --> 12:49.136
I GOT HIM THIS
MAGNIFICENT SET.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.704
IT WAS ALL IVORY,
IMPORTED FROM NAIROBI,

12:51.805 --> 12:53.706
JUST A REAL WORK OF ART.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.643
AND HE JUST LOOKED
AT THE PIECES, MESMERIZED.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.578
BUT THE BOARD, THAT WAS
ONLY HALF OF THE GIFT.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.648
THE OTHER HALF WAS THAT
I HAD BEEN WORKING ON
MY OWN CHESS GAME

13:01.748 --> 13:05.018
AND I WAS GONNA
PLAY MY BOY.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.855
SO WE SAT DOWN
AT THE CHESSBOARD.
EVERYBODY'S WATCHING.

13:07.955 --> 13:11.624
I THOUGHT I'D OPEN
WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE--

13:11.724 --> 13:13.961
THE KING'S INDIAN,
WHICH IS WHERE YOU
ESTABLISH YOUR PAWNS

13:14.061 --> 13:15.996
IN THE CENTER
OF THE BOARD.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.165
THEN HE MOVED,
AND I COUNTERED.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.033
AND HE MOVED AGAIN.
I COUNTERED AGAIN.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.002
AND WE'RE MOVING ALONG
AT THIS REAL NICE CLIP

13:22.102 --> 13:24.504
AND I THINK
I'M HOLDING MY OWN.

13:24.604 --> 13:28.275
AND THEN--

13:28.375 --> 13:31.244
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.
HE LOOKED UP SUDDENLY

13:32.479 --> 13:35.849
AND IT WAS LIKE A SHADOW
FELL OVER HIS FACE.

13:35.949 --> 13:39.786
AND HE STOOD UP FROM
THE TABLE AND HE SAID,

13:39.887 --> 13:42.455
"I'M NOT FEELING WELL.
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY."

13:45.225 --> 13:46.994
HE GOES UP TO HIS BEDROOM.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.329
I FOLLOW HIM UP THE STAIRS.
I KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.465
HE DOESN'T ANSWER.
I CRACK THE DOOR OPEN
AND I SEE HIM.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.135
HE'S SITTING AT HIS DESK.
HE'S GOT HIS BACK TO ME.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.104
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE HEARD ME.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.739
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
SOMETHING, BUT I DIDN'T.

13:59.839 --> 14:04.577
I JUST STOOD THERE
AND I STARED AT THE BACK
OF HIS HEAD.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.847
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS--

14:11.551 --> 14:13.286
IT BROKE MY HEART.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.658
AND THEN I HEARD THESE
FOOTSTEPS COMING UP BEHIND ME

14:18.758 --> 14:20.227
AND I TURN AROUND
AND IT'S MY FATHER.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.395
AND HE SAYS,
"YOU KNOW WHY HE QUIT,
DON'T YOU?"

14:22.495 --> 14:24.264
I SHOOK MY HEAD.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.101
AND HE GIVES ME THAT LOOK,
THAT LOOK THAT SEES RIGHT
THROUGH YOU.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.738
HE SAYS, "HE KNEW IN THREE
MOVES, ALEX,

14:31.838 --> 14:33.506
YOU WERE GONNA LOSE.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.410
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BEAT
HIS FATHER IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.912
HE FELT SORRY FOR YOU."

14:39.012 --> 14:41.414
DO YOU THINK HE WAS RIGHT?

14:41.514 --> 14:43.450
YEAH, I KNOW HE WAS RIGHT.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.186
THAT'S MY SON TO A TEE.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.455
AND THEN MY FATHER,
HE PULLS ME INTO A ROOM

14:48.555 --> 14:50.057
AND HE JUST
RIPPED INTO ME.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.891
HE SAYS,
"YOU ARE PATHETIC.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.761
ONE THING GOES WRONG
IN YOUR LITTLE CUSHY LIFE

14:54.861 --> 14:56.930
AND YOU TURN
SOFT AS BUTTER."

14:57.030 --> 15:00.968
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
I WASN'T EAGER TO FLY AGAIN

15:01.068 --> 15:03.836
OR WHY I WAS AWAY FROM HOME
DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT

15:03.937 --> 15:05.672
WITH GOD KNOWS WHO
LIKE A FUCKING TEENAGER.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.208
HE SAYS, "YOU DISAPPOINT
ME, BOY.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.244
I RAISED YOU TO BE
STRONGER THAN THAT.
I RAISED YOU TO BE A MAN."

15:11.344 --> 15:14.681
AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHO PUT
ALL THESE IDEAS IN MY HEAD.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.716
WHO TURNED ME INTO A--
WHAT DID HE--

15:16.816 --> 15:20.220
WHO TURNED ME INTO A SELFISH,
WHINING LITTLE BITCH.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.289
WAS IT THE FAGS
I WAS HANGING
AROUND WITH?

15:22.389 --> 15:24.457
OR WAS IT-- AND THIS ONE
HE REALLY SEIZED ON--

15:24.557 --> 15:26.459
WAS IT THE SHRINK?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.795
HOW WOULD HE KNOW
YOU WERE SEEING A SHRINK?

15:28.895 --> 15:31.298
- MICHAELA TOLD HIM.
- YOU TOLD HER?

15:31.398 --> 15:33.400
YEAH, I HAD TO.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.902
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN
PAYING YOU CASH,

15:36.003 --> 15:37.770
'CAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO AVOID A PAPER TRAIL.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.208
BUT THAT MEANS I'VE BEEN
WITHDRAWING FROM ATMs
ALL THE TIME.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.243
MICHAELA LOOKS AT
THE BANK STATEMENTS

15:43.343 --> 15:45.245
AND SHE SAW THAT THERE
WASN'T MONEY THERE

15:45.345 --> 15:47.214
AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW
WHERE IT WAS GOING.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.749
ANYWAY, LOOK,
I TOLD HER I'VE BEEN
CONSULTING WITH SOMEONE

15:49.849 --> 15:52.819
ABOUT MY THOUGHTS--
AND THAT WAS THE WORD,
"THOUGHTS"--

15:52.919 --> 15:55.722
MY THOUGHTS
ABOUT ME AND HER.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.757
AND DID YOU GET INTO THAT,

15:57.857 --> 16:00.660
YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT
THE TWO OF YOU?

16:00.760 --> 16:01.928
NO, SHE SHUT DOWN.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.131
SO ANYWAY, LISTEN.
MY FATHER--

16:04.231 --> 16:07.367
YEAH, MY FATHER-- HE GIVES ME
THIS WHOLE EARFUL.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.238
HE GOES DOWNSTAIRS,
AND, MAN...

16:12.672 --> 16:15.708
I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN
HIT BY A FREIGHT TRAIN.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.817
I LOCKED MYSELF
IN THE BATHROOM
AND I SAT THERE

16:24.917 --> 16:28.088
SO I COULD JUST
CATCH MY BREATH.

16:32.559 --> 16:37.964
AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT
MY SHIT TOGETHER I WENT
BACK DOWNSTAIRS, AND--

16:38.065 --> 16:41.134
AND EVERYBODY WAS AROUND
THE CHESSBOARD AGAIN

16:41.234 --> 16:43.036
WATCHING ANOTHER MATCH,
INCLUDING MICHAELA.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.606
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT IT WAS?

16:46.706 --> 16:50.143
IT WAS MY FATHER
AND MY SON

16:50.243 --> 16:52.279
AND THEY ARE LOCKED
IN THIS EPIC BATTLE,

16:52.379 --> 16:53.946
MATCHING EACH OTHER
MOVE FOR MOVE.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.282
TOTALLY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.385
AND EVERYONE'S
OOHING AND AHHING

16:58.485 --> 17:02.555
AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN
NOTICE THAT I WAS THERE.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.963
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT ROY
THAT BROKE YOUR HEART

17:11.064 --> 17:13.633
WHEN YOU WERE WATCHING HIM
IN HIS ROOM?

17:14.901 --> 17:18.938
UH, HE SEEMED SO...

17:19.038 --> 17:22.542
VULNERABLE, SOMEHOW.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.377
VULNERABLE TO WHAT?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.047
I DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.318
EVERYTHING--

17:33.052 --> 17:35.622
FORCES, EXPECTATIONS,

17:35.722 --> 17:39.626
STUFF COMING AT HIM
THAT HE CAN'T CONTROL,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.428
I CAN'T CONTROL.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.769
SO I SLIPPED OUT
OF THE HOUSE

17:49.869 --> 17:51.804
WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.639
IT WAS FOR THE BETTER.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.741
FOR WHOM?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.476
FOR MY BOY.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.379
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOUR SON

17:59.479 --> 18:02.515
IS BETTER OFF WITHOUT
HIS FATHER ON HIS BIRTHDAY?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.385
YEAH, I DO.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.990
AFTER THAT I GOT
IN MY CAR AND I DROVE,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.460
AND DROVE AND DROVE,
FAST.

18:13.560 --> 18:17.197
AND WHEN I FINALLY
RAN OUT OF GAS IT WAS
AFTER DARK.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.499
I WOUND UP AT THIS BAR

18:19.599 --> 18:22.101
THAT SEAN AND DANIEL
HAD TAKEN ME TO.

18:22.202 --> 18:26.339
AND I STARTED
TO DRINK HARD,

18:26.439 --> 18:30.877
LOOKING AT
ALL THE FAGGOTS
PRANCING AROUND.

18:30.977 --> 18:34.247
I FELT LIKE KNOCKING
SOMEBODY'S TEETH DOWN
THEIR FUCKING THROAT.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.520
BUT NOBODY CAME NEAR ME.
THEY DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.189
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
THEY KNEW,

18:42.289 --> 18:45.192
LIKE I HAD THIS INVISIBLE
FORCE FIELD AROUND ME.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.262
YOU SAID BEFORE

18:49.362 --> 18:51.864
WHEN YOU STARTED
TELLING ME ABOUT THE PARTY,

18:51.964 --> 18:53.266
THAT EVERYTHING
BECAME CLEAR THAT DAY.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.402
WHAT WAS IT
THAT BECAME CLEAR?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.306
THAT I NEEDED TO GO.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.973
I NEEDED TO GET
BACK TO THE NAVY--

19:01.073 --> 19:03.576
DISCIPLINE, ORDER,
"YES, SIR, NO, SIR."

19:03.676 --> 19:05.645
KNOWING WHEN
TO GO TO SLEEP,
WHEN TO WAKE UP,

19:05.745 --> 19:07.814
WHAT TO WEAR, WHAT TO EAT,
WHAT TO DO.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.849
TO GET OUT
OF MY OWN HEAD.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.452
THIS IS NOT
FOR EVERYONE, YOU KNOW,
THIS SELF-EXAMINATION.

19:12.552 --> 19:17.190
SOME OF US, WE JUST NEED
TO LIVE OUR LIVES, MAN.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.564
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WENT
TO THAT PARTICULAR BAR?

19:26.933 --> 19:28.535
I DON'T KNOW.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.706
I WANTED ANYONE
TO SO MUCH AS BREATHE

19:33.806 --> 19:36.243
SO I COULD BEAT
THE LIVING HELL OUT
OF THEM, THAT'S WHY.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.778
HMM. BUT NOBODY DID.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.181
( chuckles )
NO.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.420
COULD IT BE, ALEX,
THAT YOU WERE THERE

19:47.520 --> 19:49.489
FOR EXACTLY
THE OPPOSITE REASON?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.892
'CAUSE NO ONE WOULD
QUESTION YOU

19:52.992 --> 19:56.663
OR ASK YOU TO BE ANYTHING
OTHER THAN YOURSELF?

19:59.299 --> 20:02.402
YOU SEE, THESE
ISSUES WITH YOUR FATHER,
WITH YOUR OWN IDENTITY,

20:02.502 --> 20:06.072
WITH WHAT YOU REALLY WANT
FOR YOURSELF,

20:06.172 --> 20:10.109
THESE THINGS, THEY HAVE
TO BE LOOKED AT.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.680
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO DEAL WITH THEM
HERE ON THE GROUND

20:13.780 --> 20:16.749
THAN HAVE THEM FOLLOW YOU
20,000 FEET INTO THE AIR?

20:16.849 --> 20:20.086
WAIT, ARE YOU ACTUALLY
EXPRESSING AN OPINION HERE?

20:20.186 --> 20:23.823
ARE YOU TELLING ME
NOT TO FLY?

20:23.923 --> 20:26.025
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.828
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE ASKING ME

20:28.928 --> 20:32.832
TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANOTHER MAJOR DECISION
IN YOUR LIFE.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.935
YOU KNOW, GO BACK TO BAGHDAD,
LEAVE MICHAELA.

20:37.304 --> 20:40.307
I THINK WE'RE WAY PAST THAT.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.376
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO DECIDE, PAUL.
I CAN DECIDE.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.212
I HAVE DECIDED.

20:46.313 --> 20:49.516
NO, I'M ASKING YOU
MAN TO MAN...

20:51.351 --> 20:54.120
TELL ME,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO

20:54.220 --> 20:55.988
IF YOU WERE ME?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.430
( sighs )

21:05.698 --> 21:10.303
ALEX, IF I WAS YOU,
I WOULD STAY IN THERAPY.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.339
I WOULD CONTINUE
TO DEAL WITH THE COMPLEX,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.607
DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT,

21:14.707 --> 21:16.208
NOT SWEEP THEM
UNDER THE CARPET

21:16.309 --> 21:18.845
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING
IN YOUR LIFE.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.813
I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING:

21:22.114 --> 21:24.384
THEY WILL CREEP UP
ON YOU AGAIN.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.322
BUT YOU WON'T TELL ME
NOT TO FLY.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.667
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WRONG.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.869
I DON'T MAKE MISTAKES.

21:42.969 --> 21:46.373
WHEN I'M UP IN THE SKY,
THAT'S WHEN I'M IN CONTROL.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.979
YOU DON'T GET IT YET.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.715
I AM THE BEST.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.721
NOW, PAUL, LISTEN TO ME.
PAUL.

22:01.821 --> 22:05.425
DON'T FUCK ME UP
WITH THIS NAVY SHRINK.
PLEASE.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.695
DON'T TAKE MY WORLD
AWAY FROM ME.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.548
WELL...

22:30.016 --> 22:31.718
I THINK WE'RE DONE.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.063
WHAT IS IT, DOC?

22:49.068 --> 22:52.304
HERE'S MY CELL PHONE.

22:52.405 --> 22:56.142
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME
ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT,

22:56.242 --> 22:58.845
IF YOU NEED TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.513
OKAY?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.893
I JUST HAD A THOUGHT.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.928
SOON I'M GOING TO BE
FLYING OVER THE ARMPIT

23:16.028 --> 23:17.497
OF THE FUCKING WORLD

23:17.597 --> 23:19.398
AND I'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT YOU

23:19.499 --> 23:23.002
IN YOUR CHAIR.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.406
YOU KNOW, ALEX,

23:27.507 --> 23:30.577
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT

23:30.677 --> 23:33.179
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
GREAT WORK HERE--

23:34.346 --> 23:35.848
BRAVE.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.485
REALLY.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.088
I WANT US TO CONTINUE THAT.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.992
OKAY?

23:47.727 --> 23:50.029
- BYE, DOC.
- TAKE CARE, ALEX.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.082
