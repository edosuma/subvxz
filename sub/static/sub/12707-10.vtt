WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.503
Riley!

00:02.536 --> 00:04.905
I know you got a lot
on your mind.

00:04.937 --> 00:08.076
If you decide you want to let
me in on any of it,
You let me know.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.144
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:11.179 --> 00:14.282
RILEY: Buffy's like nobody else
in the world,
but she doesn't love me.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.187
(moans)

00:19.219 --> 00:20.721
Buffy, I love you.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.056
(gasps)
Oh, god, no.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.359
Your mother has
a brain tumor.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.460
Oh.

00:39.073 --> 00:43.610
WOMAN (through PA):
Dr. Morelli to radiology.
Dr. Morelli to radiology.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.530
Just me. Sorry.

01:02.563 --> 01:06.299
Can I get you anything?
No. Thank you.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.769
-Riley?
-I'm fine.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.710
What time is it?

01:17.745 --> 01:20.079
There's a clock
behind you, Wil.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.450
I know, but there's
a watch right above
your hand.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.087
That can't be right.

01:30.823 --> 01:33.826
Oh.

01:35.862 --> 01:40.234
(sighs deeply)
I can't stand this.

01:40.268 --> 01:44.504
-What's taking so long?
-It doesn't mean
anything.

01:44.537 --> 01:48.942
-You think?
-I'd worry more if your mom
was out of surgery quickly.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.645
Might mean that, you know,
they couldn't do much.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.382
(theme music playing)

03:18.365 --> 03:20.834
-Okay, your mom's
in recovery.
-What happened?

03:20.867 --> 03:24.572
-Is she all right?
-It was possible to visualize
the tumor completely,

03:24.604 --> 03:27.608
which means I was able
to get all of it.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.544
So, barring complications
in recovery,

03:30.578 --> 03:33.347
I think your mother's
going to be fine.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.283
Of course, we're still
going to have to watch
your mother carefully,

03:36.317 --> 03:39.287
And have her back in here
for some follow-up testing,

03:39.319 --> 03:42.723
But, uh, overall,
I'd consider the procedure
a complete success.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.567
Oh, my goodness.
Doctor, thank you.
Thank you so much.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.135
Believe me.
It's my pleasure.
(bones crunching)

03:56.168 --> 04:00.106
Ow!
Sorry! Sorry.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.545
When I was younger,
I used to put my chopsticks
in my mouth, like this,

04:05.579 --> 04:07.580
And then Buffy would chase
me around the house yelling,

04:07.615 --> 04:09.917
"I'm the Slayer.
I'm going to get you!"

04:09.949 --> 04:13.986
That's disturbing.
You're emotionally scarred
and will end up badly.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.956
No, it was great. I mean,
she didn't actually stake me
in the heart, you know.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.959
Buffy's pretty cool
like that.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.762
So, what do you want
to do now, Dawnster?

04:21.795 --> 04:23.730
Keeping in mind that I won't
chase you because I'm old,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.766
and I'm stuffed full
of moo goo gai starch.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.735
Oh, we could play that game
again--Life. That was fun.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.704
For you.
You always win.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.242
Well, we can make
a wager this time.

04:35.274 --> 04:38.446
You can give me real money.
That would be different.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.613
And after we teach her
how to gamble, maybe we can
all get drunk!

04:40.648 --> 04:43.115
I don't think the bar
would serve her.

04:43.149 --> 04:46.420
But we could bring something in.
Strawberry schnapps tastes
just like real ice cream.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.490
Okay, how's about a movie?

04:49.523 --> 04:52.292
They're showing them
in theaters now.
I hear it's like...

04:52.326 --> 04:55.329
watching a video with
a bunch of strangers
and a sticky floor.

04:55.362 --> 04:59.432
-That one looks sad.
-The chimp playing hockey?
Is that based on the Chekhov?

04:59.466 --> 05:03.302
-There's a chimp
playing hockey?
-No, the other one.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.372
I don't want to see
a sad movie.

05:05.406 --> 05:08.141
We have to see the chimp
playing hockey.
That's hilarious.

05:08.175 --> 05:11.444
The ice is so slippery, and
monkeys are all irrational.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.346
We have to see this.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.516
You pick, Dawn.
This is your night.

05:15.548 --> 05:19.319
-We are celebrating
your mom's good news.
-Oh.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.721
Go monkey.
Choose monkey.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.457
It's okay. You guys
don't have to make
a big deal for me.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.127
I'm only sleeping over here
so Buffy and Riley can boink.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.531
No. No, that's not it at all.
They just need time to, um--

05:31.564 --> 05:34.100
(clears throat)
be tender. Relax.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.571
He's not very convincing,
is he?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.742
Alone time always
translates into "Get Dawn
out of the house...

05:42.776 --> 05:46.312
so we can have loud,
obnoxious sex."

05:46.346 --> 05:48.314
Oh, does that mean
we can't?

05:48.348 --> 05:51.819
(acoustic guitar playing)

05:51.851 --> 05:57.024
* It might have been a while
 since you've been loved *

05:57.057 --> 05:59.826
Can we put this song
on repeat?

05:59.860 --> 06:03.930
-Whatever you want.
-Can we put the whole
night on repeat?

06:03.963 --> 06:05.899
Absolutely.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.268
Good.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.771
(sighs)
Mmm. I can't believe
how relaxed I feel.

06:11.805 --> 06:15.041
It's like
all the tension's
just left my body.

06:15.074 --> 06:19.579
Already?
'Cause I had that scheduled
for a little later on.

06:19.612 --> 06:23.050
Scheduled?

06:23.082 --> 06:25.752
Are you planning on
seducing me, Mr. Finn?

06:26.954 --> 06:30.122
Always.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.132
I want tonight
to be special for you.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.802
It's more than special.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.038
It's perfect.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.473
I'm glad.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.209
You deserve it after everything
you've been through.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.547
Well, it's
nothing compared to what
my mom had to deal with.

06:53.581 --> 06:57.750
But it was a lot.
And you were incredible.

06:57.784 --> 07:03.456
Not really.
Just covering for
the weepy chicken within.

07:03.490 --> 07:07.627
Don't sell yourself short.
You stayed strong
throughout, Buffy.

07:07.661 --> 07:11.130
-You never even cried.
-Oh, I cried.

07:11.163 --> 07:14.502
I cried so hard,
I didn't think I was
gonna be able to stop.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.971
(sighs)

07:20.339 --> 07:25.812
-Oh.
-That's all
in the past now.

07:25.846 --> 07:29.949
Mom's
out of the woods,

07:29.983 --> 07:32.920
And I'm here
with you.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.822
That's all
that matters.

07:52.204 --> 07:54.875
(moans)

08:05.351 --> 08:08.187
(gasping)

09:04.977 --> 09:06.947
(door opening)

09:11.551 --> 09:14.153
(door closing)

09:46.586 --> 09:50.624
(door opening,
closing)

09:54.027 --> 09:56.296
I don't know, Buffy.

09:56.328 --> 10:00.299
I think I'd look like
I had a cat on my head.
But a very well-groomed cat.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.802
I think maybe
I'll stick with a scarf.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.437
Come on. Wigs are fun.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.474
We could get you a whole
bunch of different ones.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.475
You know, you could be
like '60s mom,

10:09.509 --> 10:12.445
Action mom,
French maid mom.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.682
I must be getting better
'cause you're making fun of me.

10:14.715 --> 10:19.351
Well, you know,
got a lot of time
to make up for.

10:19.385 --> 10:22.022
You have more important
things to make up.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.356
I know you've been
missing a lot of school.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.193
I may have to take a few
incompletes, but I will make
it through the semester.

10:27.226 --> 10:30.462
Well, what about slaying
and your friends?

10:30.562 --> 10:32.465
I want you to have
your life back.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.500
Right now,
I'd rather be here,

10:34.533 --> 10:36.836
Styling your beautiful,
new, plastic dream hair.

10:36.870 --> 10:41.808
Fair enough. But you don't have
to keep me company all night.
Go out. Have fun.

10:41.841 --> 10:46.645
Get Riley to take you
to a movie or something.
I gave Riley the day off.

10:46.679 --> 10:49.649
I don't think he thinks
of you as a chore, Buffy.

10:49.682 --> 10:52.219
I know that.

10:52.251 --> 10:54.287
Look, I told him to make
plans with his friends,

10:54.321 --> 10:57.057
because I wanted to have
you all to myself, okay?

10:57.090 --> 10:59.558
Besides, I can
see him anytime.

10:59.591 --> 11:04.063
And I'm sure
he'll come over later,
looking for a little...

11:04.096 --> 11:06.133
Bible study.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.735
Well, good.

11:08.769 --> 11:12.706
I mean, just as long as
the two of you are spending
some quality time with...

11:12.806 --> 11:14.673
The lord.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.744
We are. Absolutely.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.011
ELLIS:
What have we got?

11:19.046 --> 11:21.213
Belize.
Last transmission.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.350
-Infrared scans say
that they're--
-Breeding.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.518
They're not going to stay
in that village for long.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.721
Looks like we got ourselves
a hot spot.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.621
Tell the men to get ready.

11:30.758 --> 11:34.193
What about Riley?
Agent Finn?

11:34.226 --> 11:36.696
I'm telling you, sir.
If we go in for
a sweep and drop,

11:36.730 --> 11:40.734
-He's definitely a guy
we want on the team.
-Let's bring him on board.

11:40.768 --> 11:44.203
That, uh, might take
a little convincing.

11:44.236 --> 11:49.176
Why? What's he got here
in Sunnydale that's so special?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.979
(door opens,
clicks shut)

11:53.312 --> 11:56.048
-Riley?
-It's me.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.053
Every time you show up
like this,

12:01.087 --> 12:03.623
You risk all of your parts,
you know that?

12:03.655 --> 12:06.359
I wouldn't be here if
I didn't have a good reason.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.360
As usual, I'm here
to help you, and I--

12:08.394 --> 12:11.063
-Are you naked under there?
-Get out.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.768
No, I'm serious. I mean,
not about the naked part,
I mean--

12:14.802 --> 12:16.635
Get out, or
I will drop you out
head first.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.541
I wanna show you something.

12:21.573 --> 12:23.576
What?

12:23.610 --> 12:25.544
You need to see this.

12:25.577 --> 12:27.947
(sighs)

12:27.980 --> 12:30.984
But we need to move if
we want to get there in time.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.956
(scoffs)
Oh, please!

12:35.989 --> 12:38.091
Like I give a bloody damn.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.152
(door shutting)

13:10.389 --> 13:12.225
(moaning, panting)

13:17.230 --> 13:19.899
Don't start slaying.
This isn't what
we're here for.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.004
(growling, moaning)

13:41.221 --> 13:44.691
What do you think you're doing?
Just having
a little look, mate.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.394
-Keep it down.
-You can't go up there.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.932
I said keep it down.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.466
-Harder.
-(sucking)

14:29.635 --> 14:32.072
(gasps)

14:45.817 --> 14:48.054
(sucking)

14:48.087 --> 14:50.657
Buffy.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.730
-Buffy!
-We only came here 'cause
we care about you, friend.

14:59.831 --> 15:01.668
You need help.

15:04.903 --> 15:07.639
Hey.
Hey! Hey!

15:20.253 --> 15:22.654
I thought you should know.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.909
Was that the Slayer?

15:43.942 --> 15:46.578
What the hell
do you think you're doing,
bringing the Slayer here?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.349
-Back off. I didn't know.
-Nobody's gonna
risk coming here now.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.783
I said back off!

16:43.602 --> 16:48.075
-Get out.
-I need to talk
to you.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.244
I'm not in
a talking mood.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.413
Then listen.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.648
Riley, just give
the man a chance.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.450
If you don't like
what you hear,
we'll be on our way.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.087
Talk fast.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.322
We have a Code One
in Belize.

17:03.355 --> 17:07.193
A demon tribe
is taking apart missionaries
in the rain forest down there.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.230
And you're telling me
this because--

17:11.262 --> 17:14.701
We're going down
to terminate their operation.
We want you to join us.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.343
-I'm a civilian.
-You're a soldier.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.876
I quit the government
a long way back.

17:24.911 --> 17:28.280
-We're not government.
We're army.
-GRAHAM: Just like you.

17:31.049 --> 17:34.721
It's not the initiative, Finn.
We don't do experiments.

17:34.753 --> 17:39.259
None of us give a damn
what makes monsters tick.
We just stop 'em.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.396
What do you need me for?

17:44.431 --> 17:48.300
I think you can
handle yourself,
and I always need bodies.

17:48.335 --> 17:52.572
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's the real deal.

17:52.605 --> 17:57.144
High risk, low pay,
and seriously messy.

17:57.176 --> 18:01.248
We ship out
for Central America
tomorrow midnight.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.950
Now, maybe civilian life
is working out for you,

18:06.486 --> 18:08.454
and maybe not.

18:09.689 --> 18:13.460
Midnight, tomorrow.
Decision's yours.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.337
And so it begins.

18:25.372 --> 18:30.777
No longer a victim of crass
holiday commercialization,
I'm a purveyor of it.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.648
Oh, who ordered
more chicken's feet?

18:36.682 --> 18:38.951
The ones we have
aren't moving at all.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.787
That's generally what happens
when you cut them off
the chicken.

18:40.819 --> 18:46.025
I'm serious.
Maybe we could do
a holiday promotion.

18:46.057 --> 18:47.993
One free with
every purchase.

18:48.027 --> 18:51.029
Oh, yeah.
Dear holiday memories.

18:51.063 --> 18:54.866
Merry tykes by the fire
enjoying their new
Christmas chicken feet.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.703
Aw, holding them tight
as they fall asleep,

18:57.737 --> 18:59.771
Painting their
little toenails.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.842
(chuckling)
That's very humorous.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.977
Make fun of
the ex-demon.

19:05.010 --> 19:08.280
I can just hear you
in private:
"I dislike that Anya.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.116
She's newly human
and strangely literal."

19:11.150 --> 19:16.122
Anya, I don't say that.
No one says that.
No one talks that way.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.458
Well, there's nothing
wrong with my idea
anyway.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.660
I've been very good
for this store.

19:20.692 --> 19:23.730
If it wasn't for me,
Giles would be
a terrified old man,

19:23.762 --> 19:25.731
staring at a quarterly
tax statement
and wetting himself.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.634
I say, that's
an exaggeration.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.003
Anya, you've
helped out a lot,
but I have too.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.073
Yes, I forgot about
all the vigorous
sitting around.

19:34.105 --> 19:36.308
Anya, you can
back off a little.
You get paid.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.676
Willow's doing this
on her own time.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.481
I'm sorry, Willow.
Thank you for making
time in your busy life...

19:42.515 --> 19:44.483
to come in here and
get in the way of mine.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.185
-Anya, play nice.
-You know, fine.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.556
Take her side instead
of mine, even though
I'm the one...

19:49.588 --> 19:54.361
who sleeps with you, and
feeds you, and bathes you.

19:54.394 --> 19:58.765
-She bathes you?
-Only in an erotic,
 Penthouse -y way,

19:58.798 --> 20:02.000
Not in a sponge-bathy,
geriatric sort--

20:02.034 --> 20:04.703
Please, stop!
I beg of you.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.073
(bell ringing)

20:10.076 --> 20:13.579
I need to find out
everything I can about
a vamp nest downtown.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.348
-A nest? What sort--
-There were people there.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.184
It, um, it looked like...

20:19.218 --> 20:21.453
They were paying
vampires to bite them.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.957
Now I know what to
get for the person
who has everything.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.192
Who would pay
to get bitten?

20:27.226 --> 20:30.797
Oh, that's been going on
for centuries. Humans hire
vampires to feed off them.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.266
They, well, you know,
they get off on the rush.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.468
GILES:
And the danger.
The hazards of the underworld...

20:35.501 --> 20:38.270
can become addictive
to some people.

20:38.305 --> 20:41.039
-Why don't the vampires
just kill them?
-Because they get cash,

20:41.073 --> 20:43.142
hot-and-cold
running blood,

20:43.174 --> 20:46.112
And they don't leave
any corpses behind, so
they don't get hunted.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.647
But still, it can be
terribly dangerous for humans.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.950
I mean, people can end up
dying accidentally.

20:50.982 --> 20:55.488
Or meeting a vampire
who only pretends to play
by the house rules.

20:55.521 --> 20:58.156
You knew about this,
and you didn't tell me?

20:58.190 --> 21:00.460
I-I haven't seen it
since my Ripper days.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.595
I had no idea
it was going on
in Sunnydale.

21:02.628 --> 21:03.630
Well, it is.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.632
And I'm going
to stop it.

21:07.500 --> 21:12.305
Buffy, even if I had known
about this, I might not have
told you right now.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.773
What? Why?

21:14.807 --> 21:17.242
I'm not sure
it's where your efforts
are best spent.

21:17.276 --> 21:21.146
Perhaps you should focus
on a less ambiguous evil.

21:21.180 --> 21:24.317
-Glory, for instance?
-You said people are dying.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.251
They're willing victims.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.020
I mean, there are people
out there who deserve
your help who aren't.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.958
Vampires are vampires.
And my job description
is pretty clear.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.126
Are you coming with me
or not?

21:35.161 --> 21:37.128
What's the rush, Buff?
If we're going into a nest,

21:37.163 --> 21:39.999
maybe we should
come up with a strategy.
Wait for Riley.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.802
Back me up or not--

21:43.836 --> 21:45.572
I'm going.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.210
Anya, will you
mind the store?

21:55.682 --> 21:58.351
Have a nice day.
Don't get killed.
(door closes)

21:58.384 --> 22:00.720
I don't understand.

22:00.752 --> 22:04.557
This place was doing
serious business
last night.

22:04.590 --> 22:08.160
I guess everybody jumped ship
once word got out that
the Slayer found their crib.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.329
I just want to
apologize for the use
of the word crib.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.133
BUFFY:
Do you think they'll
set up shop again in town?

22:14.165 --> 22:17.169
It's hard to say.
I'm sure they'll
lie low for a bit.

22:17.202 --> 22:20.972
But they're around somewhere.
There's got to be a way
to find these creeps.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.174
Don't worry, Buff.
You'll find them.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.044
Yeah. I'm sure
you'll get them
next time, champ.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.535
What took you?

22:48.567 --> 22:50.502
It takes a while to get
to full strength
after those bites.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.739
Hey, hey!
Let's be reasonable
about this!

22:52.771 --> 22:54.673
You may have noticed, Spike.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.343
I left reasonable
about three exits back.

22:57.375 --> 23:02.013
Look, I'm not the one
who got you into this.
Don't kill the messenger.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.652
-(screams)
-Why the hell not?

23:12.090 --> 23:15.027
Ow!
Bloody hell!

23:15.060 --> 23:18.064
Oh, god!
Hey.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.935
Plastic wood grain.
Looks real, doesn't it?

23:25.805 --> 23:27.973
Don't think I don't
know what's going on
with you, Spike.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.611
Stay away from her.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.012
Or we'll do this
for real next time.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.250
(chuckling)

23:41.287 --> 23:45.458
Oh, man. You're really
under it, aren't you?

23:45.491 --> 23:47.759
What?

23:47.794 --> 23:50.697
Look at you. All afraid
I'm hot for your honey.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.666
Because you are.

23:54.701 --> 23:57.103
Well, yeah.

23:57.135 --> 24:00.271
But that's not
your problem.

24:00.306 --> 24:03.776
Even if I wasn't in the picture,
you're never going
to be able to hold onto her.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.278
Aah! Bloody hell!

24:06.311 --> 24:08.615
Maybe I didn't
almost kill you enough.

24:08.647 --> 24:13.586
Ah, come on. You're
not the long-haul guy,
and you know it.

24:13.619 --> 24:17.523
Shut up.
You know it, or else you
wouldn't be getting suck jobs...

24:17.557 --> 24:19.391
from two-bit vampire trulls.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.397
(groans)

24:28.835 --> 24:32.805
The girl needs some
monster in her man.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.707
And that's not
in your nature.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.846
No matter how low
you try to go.

24:52.423 --> 24:55.728
You actually think
you got a shot with her?

24:55.761 --> 25:00.799
No, I don't.
Fella's got to try
though.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.233
Gotta do
what he can.

25:04.403 --> 25:06.739
If you touched her...

25:06.772 --> 25:08.974
you know
I'd kill you for real.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.243
If I had this chip out of
my head, I'd have killed
you long ago.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.883
Ain't love grand?

25:27.393 --> 25:30.730
Sometimes I envy you
so much it chokes me.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.102
And sometimes I think
I got the better deal.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.373
(scoffs)

25:41.406 --> 25:45.076
To be that close to her
and not have her.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.579
To be all alone, even
when you're holding her.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.951
Feeling her,
feeling her beneath you.

25:52.984 --> 25:57.757
Surrounding you,
the scent.

25:57.789 --> 25:59.959
No. You got
the better deal.

26:10.068 --> 26:14.306
I'm the lucky guy.
Yeah.

26:16.407 --> 26:19.746
(sighs deeply)
I'm the guy.

26:27.519 --> 26:31.958
(grunting)

26:44.036 --> 26:47.272
How long has she
been in there?
A while now.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.910
Seems pretty gung ho
about it, too. Didn't even
stop to say hello.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.112
Yeah. When we went
to deal with that
vampire nest,

26:53.144 --> 26:55.080
she got all Rambo
and torched the place.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.349
Something seriously bad
is going on with her.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.251
Oh, I don't know,
maybe you're overreacting.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.321
I mean, who hasn't done stuff
like that from time to time?

27:03.355 --> 27:05.490
I mean, I made this one guy
spontaneously combust...

27:05.523 --> 27:06.992
and he set
his whole village on fire.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.661
Would you
stop being scary
for a minute...

27:08.694 --> 27:10.696
And listen to what
I'm trying to tell you?

27:12.699 --> 27:15.401
-She in there?
-She's training.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.105
Would you guys mind
clearing out?

27:19.137 --> 27:21.339
I need a minute alone with her.

27:21.373 --> 27:26.144
(chuckles)
A little after-hours hanky-panky
in the training room, huh?

27:26.178 --> 27:28.380
Boy, Xander and I could
tell you some stories.

27:28.413 --> 27:31.517
Not now. Let's go, Anya.
There's a funny thing
with the vaulting horse--

27:31.549 --> 27:35.554
Anya!
What?
He started it.

27:35.586 --> 27:37.990
In your world maybe,
but where the people are,
this isn't time...

27:38.023 --> 27:40.659
for tales of Anya
and Xander's sex-capades.
Oh.

27:42.327 --> 27:47.032
Um, well, maybe we can
go home and, you know,
have 'em.

27:47.066 --> 27:50.201
Actually, I've got some stuff
to take care of.

27:57.675 --> 27:59.846
We need to talk.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.613
I'm not ready to talk
to you yet.

28:06.251 --> 28:08.354
Too bad.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.991
I'm serious, unless
you want to fight.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.926
So let's fight.

28:14.961 --> 28:17.896
We need to have this out,
Buffy, right now.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.332
And say what, Riley?

28:20.365 --> 28:22.034
What were you
thinking?

28:22.067 --> 28:24.770
How long have you
been lying to me?

28:24.804 --> 28:28.039
Nothing you say
right now is gonna
make this better.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.876
I realize that.
I don't expect--

28:32.711 --> 28:34.645
I just need you
to hear me out.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.682
Fine.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.919
Get your hand off of me.

28:46.724 --> 28:48.626
(sighs deeply)

28:55.334 --> 28:58.805
I think, when this
thing started,

28:58.837 --> 29:02.141
It was just some stupid,
immature game.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.410
I wanted to even the score
after you let Dracula bite you.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.711
-I did not let Dracula--
-I know!

29:06.744 --> 29:11.317
On some level, I know that.
But I was still spun.

29:13.618 --> 29:16.989
I don't know.
I wanted to know
what you felt.

29:17.022 --> 29:20.226
I wanted to know
why Dracula and Angel
have so much power over you.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.728
You so don't get it.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.396
I wanted to get it, Buffy.

29:25.431 --> 29:29.300
-I wanted to get you.
-So this is my fault?

29:29.335 --> 29:33.172
"Hey, gee, Buffy's so
mysterious, I think I'll
go out and almost die.

29:33.204 --> 29:36.976
I think I'll go
and let some other--"

29:37.009 --> 29:39.111
This isn't your fault.
It's mine.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.079
And I feel like hell
for what I've put you through.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.451
But it's just--
(sighs)

29:45.483 --> 29:47.519
These girls--

29:47.552 --> 29:53.159
-Vampires. Killers.
-They made me feel
something, Buffy.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.461
Something I didn't even know
I was missing until--

29:55.493 --> 29:57.462
I can't. I can't
hear this.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.199
You need to hear this!

30:00.231 --> 30:04.702
Fine. Fine! Tell me
about your whores!

30:04.736 --> 30:08.707
Tell me what on earth
they were giving you
that I can't.

30:08.740 --> 30:11.777
They needed me.

30:11.809 --> 30:15.681
They needed your money.
It wasn't about you.

30:15.713 --> 30:18.683
No. On some basic level,
it was about me.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.719
My blood, my body.

30:25.057 --> 30:29.895
When they bit me,
it was beyond passion.

30:31.829 --> 30:34.532
They wanted to
devour me, all of me.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.002
Why are you
telling me this?

30:37.036 --> 30:41.106
It wasn't real, I know.
It was just physical.

30:43.342 --> 30:48.380
But the fact that
I craved it, that--
that I kept going back,

30:48.413 --> 30:52.050
even if it was fleeting,
they made me feel like
they had such...

30:52.084 --> 30:54.052
hunger for me.

30:56.587 --> 31:00.291
And I don't make you
feel that way?

31:04.529 --> 31:07.032
How on earth can you
compare me to that?

31:07.066 --> 31:10.669
How can you tell me
you understand what those
vampires are feeling?

31:10.701 --> 31:15.441
You weren't a passion to them.
You were a snack.
A willing, idiotic snack.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.276
I know exactly what they
feel when they bite me,

31:17.308 --> 31:19.411
Because I feel it every time
we're together.

31:19.444 --> 31:23.882
It's like the whole
world falls away,
and all there is is you.

31:23.915 --> 31:27.853
And you think that I don't
feel the same way about you?

31:27.885 --> 31:29.587
How dare you tell me
what I feel.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.623
You keep me at
a distance, Buffy.

31:31.656 --> 31:34.393
You didn't even
call me when your mom
went into the hospital.

31:34.425 --> 31:37.628
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, um--

31:37.663 --> 31:41.232
I'm sorry that I couldn't
take care of you when I thought
that my mother was dying.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.434
It's about me taking
care of you!

31:45.604 --> 31:47.138
It's about letting me in...

31:47.173 --> 31:49.075
So you don't have to be on top
of everything all the time.

31:49.107 --> 31:52.510
But I do!
That's part of what
being a slayer is.

31:54.445 --> 31:57.449
And that's what this
is really about, isn't it?

31:57.482 --> 32:00.519
You can't handle the fact
that I'm stronger than you.

32:02.453 --> 32:04.455
It's hard sometimes,
yeah.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.093
-But that's not it.
-Then what?

32:07.125 --> 32:09.760
What else do you
want from me, Riley?

32:09.795 --> 32:11.797
I've given you
everything that I have.

32:11.829 --> 32:14.900
I've given you my heart,
my body and soul.

32:14.932 --> 32:17.769
You say that,
but I don't feel it.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.971
I just don't feel it.

32:20.006 --> 32:23.342
Well, whose fault is that?

32:23.375 --> 32:26.845
Because I'm telling you,
this is it.

32:26.877 --> 32:30.949
This is me.
This is the package.

32:30.982 --> 32:35.753
And if it's so deficient
that you need to get
your kicks elsewhere...

32:35.787 --> 32:39.025
Then we really have a problem.

32:50.568 --> 32:54.440
They want me back, Buffy.
The military.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.541
It's deep undercover.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.345
No contact with civilians.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.750
Transport's
leaving tonight.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.988
Tonight?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.424
When were you gonna
tell me about this?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.729
I'm telling you now.

33:20.398 --> 33:23.301
-Are you going?
-I don't know.

33:23.335 --> 33:27.005
If we can't
work this out--

33:27.038 --> 33:31.609
Then what?
This is good-bye?

33:35.747 --> 33:38.317
You are unbelievable.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.751
You're giving me an ultimatum?

33:40.786 --> 33:43.055
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are!

33:43.088 --> 33:45.057
You expect me to get over it
now, or you're gone.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.759
I don't. Buffy,
that's not what I meant.
No, I've heard enough.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.827
I will not take
the blame for this.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.263
-I'm not asking you to.
-Let go of me.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.031
Or what, you'll hit me?

33:56.301 --> 33:58.237
Go ahead.

33:58.269 --> 34:00.838
Come on. Do it.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.375
Get out of my way.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.644
I'm serious, Buffy.
Hit me. Hit me.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.322
I'm leaving, Buffy.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.427
Unless you give me
a reason to stay...

34:22.460 --> 34:24.730
I'm leaving tonight.

34:32.971 --> 34:36.442
(door opens, closes)

34:50.322 --> 34:53.592
The pyro act
was a bad idea, Slayer.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.094
Felt pretty good to me.

34:56.128 --> 34:59.764
I'm not running.
And you're not
shutting me down.

34:59.797 --> 35:01.699
(growls)

35:02.634 --> 35:04.635
In fact,

35:05.804 --> 35:08.539
you're not gonna make it
through the night.

35:17.182 --> 35:20.186
Walk away.
I'm serious.

35:23.355 --> 35:26.525
-Don't do this, not now.
-(growling)

35:45.876 --> 35:47.545
(shivering)

36:07.898 --> 36:10.202
(screams)

36:14.005 --> 36:16.375
So, how'd that
work out for ya?

36:16.407 --> 36:18.476
Make ya feel better?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.545
What are you doing here?

36:20.579 --> 36:22.847
I thought you might
need to talk.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.384
Then I saw this
skirmish happen.
I was gonna lend a hand,

36:25.416 --> 36:27.753
But I noticed you grew
a few extra ones.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.454
Go home, Xander.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.826
-Buffy.
-I'm serious.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.027
So am I.
Something's up.

36:37.061 --> 36:39.597
You're acting like
a crazy person.

36:56.947 --> 36:58.884
Take this, for instance.

36:58.916 --> 37:02.588
You don't wanna deal,
so you hide?
Not very slayer-like.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.623
Just leave me
alone, Xander.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.425
You have no idea
what's going on.

37:06.458 --> 37:09.760
No? Good. So you and Riley
aren't imploding?

37:12.163 --> 37:14.532
Doesn't take a genius.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.735
What I can't figure out is how
you never saw it coming.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.936
What? Who told you?

37:18.969 --> 37:20.972
Nobody told me
anything, Buffy.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.409
It was right in front
of my Xander face.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.311
The guy would
do anything for you.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.646
The guy got himself
bit by a vampire.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.115
He lied to me.

37:31.148 --> 37:33.251
He ran around
behind my back,

37:33.284 --> 37:35.320
and almost
got himself killed.

37:35.353 --> 37:38.389
And now he tells me
that he's leaving,

37:38.423 --> 37:41.059
with some covert
military operation
at midnight,

37:41.092 --> 37:43.829
unless I convince him
not to.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.898
Now tell me
that you understand.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.668
Because I sure as hell don't.

37:49.701 --> 37:54.505
-You gonna let him go?
-It's not my decision
to make.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.574
-Of course it is.-
Why? It's not fair.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.844
Who cares if it's fair?

37:58.876 --> 38:02.847
In about 20 minutes,
Riley's gonna disappear,

38:02.880 --> 38:05.516
maybe forever, unless you
do something to stop him.

38:05.550 --> 38:09.119
What am I supposed
to do, beg him to stay?

38:09.153 --> 38:12.490
Why wouldn't you?
To keep Riley here--

38:12.523 --> 38:15.293
I don't even know
who he is anymore.

38:15.327 --> 38:18.597
I mean, I thought
he was dependable.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.701
-Dependable?
What is he, State Farm?
-You know what I mean.

38:22.733 --> 38:26.204
Yeah, I think you mean
convenient.

38:26.237 --> 38:30.108
I think you took it for granted
that he was gonna show up
when you wanted him to,

38:30.141 --> 38:32.177
and take off
when you didn't.
Look who's talking.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.813
Look who has Anya
following him around
like a lovesick puppy.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.614
Oh, boy, is this
not about me.

38:36.648 --> 38:41.186
Is she more than a convenience?
'Cause that would kind of
be a surprise.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.855
If you don't wanna
hear what I have to say,
I'll shut up right now.

38:43.889 --> 38:48.559
-Good, 'cause I don't.
-I lied. See, what I think?

38:48.594 --> 38:51.128
You got burned with Angel,
and then Riley shows up.

38:51.161 --> 38:55.800
-I know the story, Xander.
-But you missed the point.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.969
You shut down, Buffy.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.972
And you've been treating Riley
like the rebound guy.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.608
When he's the one that comes
along once in a lifetime.

39:05.175 --> 39:08.313
He's never held back with you.
He's risked everything.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.347
And you're about
to let him fly,

39:10.382 --> 39:11.682
because you don't
like ultimatums?

39:14.184 --> 39:20.559
If he's not the guy, if
 what he needs from you just
 isn't there, let him go.

39:20.592 --> 39:23.762
Break his heart
and make it a clean break.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.233
But if you really think
you can love this guy?

39:29.266 --> 39:33.472
I'm talking scary, messy,
no-emotions-barred need.

39:35.239 --> 39:37.543
If you're ready for that,

39:37.576 --> 39:40.545
then think about
what you're about to lose.

39:51.155 --> 39:54.760
-Xander.
-Run.

39:59.465 --> 40:03.001
(doors swing open,
slam shut)

41:14.739 --> 41:17.708
Riley! Riley!

41:21.146 --> 41:23.181
Riley!

41:25.884 --> 41:27.518
Riley!

42:15.601 --> 42:17.235
XANDER:
 I've gotta say something.

42:17.268 --> 42:19.436
Because I don't think
I've made it clear.

42:22.539 --> 42:24.409
I'm in love with you.

42:26.311 --> 42:29.047
Powerfully,
painfully in love.

42:30.748 --> 42:32.751
The things you do.

42:33.918 --> 42:38.123
The way you think.
The way you move.

42:38.155 --> 42:40.626
I get excited every time
I'm about to see you.

42:44.161 --> 42:47.632
You make me feel like
I've never felt before
in my life.

42:47.666 --> 42:49.134
Like a man.

42:54.338 --> 42:56.807
I just thought
you might wanna know.

43:28.673 --> 43:31.842
(helicopter blades whirring)

43:54.632 --> 43:57.402
(theme music playing)

44:24.561 --> 44:27.164
Grr! Arrgh!
