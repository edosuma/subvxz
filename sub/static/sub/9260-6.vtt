"a hundred-dollar suit."

Who's this?

22:16.800 --> 22:20.395
It's Terry Crowley. He was
one of my guys, killed by a
drug dealer couple years ago.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.751
That is one version.
Terry was working for Justice,

22:23.960 --> 22:27.999

of a relationship between
drug dealers and your clients.

You have a different version?

Detective Mackey, either acting alone
or with other members of his team,

22:34.480 --> 22:37.836
killed Detective Crowley or
put him in a position to be killed.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.919

murder before you blew our sting?

Actually, if you could, uh,
have your clients walk me
through the house

23:27.880 --> 23:30.633

that would be great.

difficult to make both the tuitions.

with the money all the time.

he does that?

provider, wouldn't you say?

now that you have to split the pie

really like doing that.

and is setting you up
to take the fall.

44:50.320 --> 44:53.278
Today I find out this is about
capital murder on a cop.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.357
Becca, it's a put-up job.
Right now,

44:56.640 --> 45:00.235
I have no clue about who
the hell you really are.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.431
How can I help you with that?

45:10.040 --> 45:14.272
I actually had a kernel of faith
that you could take the guy down.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.835
Now it just seems like
you've lost your senses.

45:17.040 --> 45:19.395
You're under investigation,
councilman.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.637
For what?
Your connection with Mackey.

45:22.840 --> 45:27.231
I don't understand how you could
be so gung ho to get this guy

45:27.760 --> 45:29.830
and yet be in his pocket
at the same time.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.871
Something I gotta look at.

45:32.080 --> 45:36.119
What, you still think that I helped Vic
set you up with that Russian sting?

45:36.880 --> 45:40.475
Man, he got to you.
Playing us against each other.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.035
You may as well fold up
your tent and go home.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.191
One thing I know for sure,

45:45.400 --> 45:47.277
when you sat in this office,

45:47.480 --> 45:51.268
you could've put an end to him,
but you didn't. Now it's my turn.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.836
You seriously think this little
display of yours is gonna work?

45:58.080 --> 46:01.595
I need you to initial here, here,

46:02.360 --> 46:04.715
and I'd really like
your signature here.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.675
You're sill a reserve cop, right?

46:10.880 --> 46:12.677
I do have authority over you.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.190
You walk out that door,
I'm gonna take your badge

46:16.400 --> 46:20.279
and I'm gonna tell every
reporter in town why.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.072
Then you may as well add
insubordination to your list
of bullshit allegations.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.197
You want any paperwork signed,

46:26.400 --> 46:28.755
you send it to my office, I'll have
the city attorney take a look at it.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.194
Fine.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.879
I'm chairman of the
Police Committee.

46:32.080 --> 46:34.036
This is a fight you don't want.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.197
I didn't want any of it.

46:37.400 --> 46:43.714
But I'm here and I'm staying.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.152
Corrine, call me.

46:46.360 --> 46:49.158
Kavanaugh's upstairs with Aceveda.
What the hell's going on?

46:49.360 --> 46:51.396
It's almost 8 and he's still at it.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.795
What do we do, just
leave for the night?

46:54.400 --> 46:56.516

47:17.280 --> 47:18.872
