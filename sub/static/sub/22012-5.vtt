WEBVTT

00:00.132 --> 00:01.279
<i>Ah, Nerd love.</i>

00:01.503 --> 00:03.270
<i>The beautiful union
of comic book junkies</i>

00:03.445 --> 00:04.908
<i>with the same pop culture interests.</i>

00:05.148 --> 00:06.803
<i>Back in the '80s, before the Internet,</i>

00:07.255 --> 00:10.023
<i>it was impossible to
find your geeky soulmate.</i>

00:10.058 --> 00:12.458
<i>But, by sheer fate, I met Jackie Geary,</i>

00:12.494 --> 00:15.495
<i>and, man, was the force of
nerd love strong with us.</i>

00:15.530 --> 00:17.597
I can't believe you made me
a Beaker from the Muppets!

00:17.632 --> 00:18.698
You so get me!

00:21.536 --> 00:23.269
<i>She really did get me.</i>

00:23.304 --> 00:25.672
<i>We all loved the same
marshmallow-based movies.</i>

00:25.707 --> 00:28.307
<i>We both wore geeky T-shirts.</i>

00:28.343 --> 00:30.710
<i>And we were even the
only two kids in class</i>

00:30.745 --> 00:34.047
<i>to spend our allowance on a modem.</i>

00:34.082 --> 00:37.617
<i>It was pure, awkward nerd
love, and I was in deep.</i>

00:37.652 --> 00:39.218
<i>When Jackie kissed me,</i>

00:39.254 --> 00:41.788
<i>I lost all sense of
space, time, and words.</i>

00:41.823 --> 00:43.289
Mo!

00:43.324 --> 00:44.457
Yes!

00:44.492 --> 00:45.558
Ed McMahon!

00:45.593 --> 00:46.926
You are correct, sir!

00:46.961 --> 00:48.528
<i>And then it all came crashing down.</i>

00:48.563 --> 00:51.531
Boom! Halloween just got awesome.

00:51.566 --> 00:53.966
We're gonna be the universe's
greatest power couple,

00:54.002 --> 00:56.502
Han Solo and Princess Leia.

00:56.538 --> 00:57.937
"Star Wars."

00:57.972 --> 00:59.806
Um, polite pass.

00:59.841 --> 01:00.907
Wait, you don't like "Star Wars"?

01:00.942 --> 01:02.008
How do you not like "Star Wars"?

01:02.043 --> 01:02.975
Everyone likes "Star Wars."

01:03.011 --> 01:04.977
Well, sure, I enjoy lighter fare

01:05.013 --> 01:06.879
just as much as the next girl.

01:06.915 --> 01:08.581
It's about the "Dark Side"!

01:08.616 --> 01:10.283
How can it be lighter fare?

01:10.318 --> 01:12.618
In the last movie, there
were walking teddy bears.

01:12.654 --> 01:13.686
They're Ewoks!

01:13.722 --> 01:15.188
And they helped defeat the damn Empire!

01:15.223 --> 01:16.489
No, no.

01:16.524 --> 01:17.690
Let's not yell.

01:17.726 --> 01:19.058
We're just calmly debating.

01:19.094 --> 01:20.159
<i>The truth was out.</i>

01:20.195 --> 01:22.361
<i>Jackie liked stupid "Star Trek"!</i>

01:22.397 --> 01:23.963
Actually, there is no debate.

01:23.998 --> 01:25.798
"Trek" is better because it's about

01:25.834 --> 01:27.900
humanity's quest for
knowledge and peace.

01:27.936 --> 01:30.336
A quest for peace in
the stars means no wars,

01:30.371 --> 01:32.705
which means the entire
point of "Star Trek"

01:32.741 --> 01:34.540
is to eliminate "Star Wars"!

01:34.576 --> 01:35.508
No, no!

01:35.543 --> 01:36.576
We're just talking!

01:36.611 --> 01:38.044
<i>I'm not super angry at all!</i>

01:38.079 --> 01:39.946
This is our first costume as a couple.

01:39.981 --> 01:41.180
It's a very big statement,

01:41.216 --> 01:43.750
which is why I should be
Uhura and you should be Spock.

01:43.785 --> 01:45.952
You want me to go out in public

01:45.987 --> 01:48.421
with a bowl cut and pointy elf ears?

01:48.456 --> 01:49.655
No, no.

01:49.691 --> 01:51.090
We're in love.

01:51.126 --> 01:53.326
Which is why we should get
an independent third party

01:53.361 --> 01:54.494
with no skin in the game.

01:54.529 --> 01:56.829
Father? Which do you like best?

01:56.865 --> 01:58.698
"Star Wars" or "Star Trek"?

01:58.733 --> 01:59.832
Which is the one with the purple fish?

01:59.868 --> 02:01.200
Neither of them have purple fish.

02:01.236 --> 02:03.202
"Star Wars" has got the guy
with the little feet, right?

02:03.238 --> 02:04.971
I have no idea who you're talking about!

02:05.006 --> 02:06.572
- Do you mean Yoda?
- No...

02:06.608 --> 02:07.707
- Hammerhead?
- No...

02:07.742 --> 02:08.975
- Jawas?
- No!

02:09.009 --> 02:11.110
I'm talking about the one
guy with the weird head.

02:11.146 --> 02:12.745
- You mean Jabba the Hutt?
- No.

02:12.781 --> 02:13.846
- Greedo?
- No.

02:13.882 --> 02:15.014
- Admiral Ackbar?
- No.

02:15.049 --> 02:15.948
Aunt Beru?

02:15.984 --> 02:16.849
Aunt Beru?!

02:16.885 --> 02:17.750
Gah!

02:17.786 --> 02:19.051
I can't do this right now!

02:19.087 --> 02:21.754
Jackie and I have major
problems to deal with.

02:21.790 --> 02:23.990
And that is how you get out of

02:24.025 --> 02:26.025
a ridiculous conversation.

You're all pushing it!

02:54.222 --> 02:55.755
Whoaaaaa.

02:55.790 --> 02:57.456
I'll go first.

02:57.492 --> 02:59.358
Oh, mystical Ouija.

02:59.394 --> 03:01.894
Will there ever be more
lenient laws on public nudity?

03:01.930 --> 03:03.796
Please say yes. Come on!

03:03.832 --> 03:05.798
- Yes! Naked Rob wins!
- I got one.

03:05.834 --> 03:08.201
Will I still hit that
senior-year growth spurt

03:08.236 --> 03:09.602
my mother promised me?

03:11.239 --> 03:12.438
My mother lied!

03:12.473 --> 03:13.606
<i>My turn!</i>

03:13.641 --> 03:16.742
Dear Mr. Ouija, I know
me and Lainey broke up,

03:16.778 --> 03:17.977
but does she still love me

03:18.012 --> 03:19.812
with every fiber of her slammin' bod?

03:19.848 --> 03:21.247
- Dude!
- Forget Lainey.

03:21.282 --> 03:22.181
I can't help it!

03:22.217 --> 03:24.050
She's visiting Erica this weekend.

03:24.085 --> 03:26.085
It's like every time I close my eyes,

03:26.120 --> 03:28.721
I smell her Debbie Gibson
"Electric Youth" perfume.

03:28.756 --> 03:29.655
That's just me.

03:29.691 --> 03:30.723
What? It's unisex.

03:30.758 --> 03:32.491
Let the Ouija answer!

03:32.527 --> 03:34.894
Does Lainey want me back?!

03:34.929 --> 03:36.996
Now, gently rest your fingers

03:37.031 --> 03:38.431
upon the plastic pointer thingy.

03:40.268 --> 03:42.902
Oh, no, my life is worthless!

03:42.937 --> 03:46.138
But, will Barry instead
marry Alyssa Milano

03:46.174 --> 03:48.674
and have three kids and six jet skis?

03:49.844 --> 03:51.410
Interesting.

03:51.446 --> 03:54.447
Okay, next question, Mr. Ouija.

03:54.482 --> 03:57.049
Will I be a multi-platinum
rap sensation

03:57.085 --> 03:59.652
and own my own brand
of diet soft drinks?

03:59.687 --> 04:01.654
- Come on.
- Get over here.

04:01.689 --> 04:03.289
You see? It is you guys moving it!

04:03.324 --> 04:05.224
Dude, when you ended things with Lainey,

04:05.260 --> 04:07.260
you both promised to
give each other space.

04:07.295 --> 04:08.928
- We just want to see you happy.
- You're right.

04:08.963 --> 04:10.830
No more calling Lainey.

04:10.865 --> 04:13.833
On an unrelated note, Geoff,
what's my sister's number?

04:14.669 --> 04:15.801
Hello?

04:15.837 --> 04:17.435
Just making my weekly phone call

04:17.471 --> 04:19.305
to make sure our bond is still strong.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.874
You have never once called
me before this very moment.

04:21.910 --> 04:23.676
The last words you said to me were,

04:23.711 --> 04:25.544
"Your bedroom is now my fart closet."

04:25.580 --> 04:27.780
That does sound like me.

04:27.815 --> 04:30.016
Anywho, how's it going? Having fun?

04:30.051 --> 04:31.050
Learning stuff?

04:31.085 --> 04:32.318
Are you near Lainey?

04:32.353 --> 04:33.853
And I don't care about you!

04:33.888 --> 04:35.254
Put her on the phone!

04:35.290 --> 04:36.489
Dude, no.

04:36.524 --> 04:37.957
I'm gonna do what's best
for both of you right now

04:37.992 --> 04:39.659
and hang up.

04:39.694 --> 04:41.727
Please, Lainey, come back!

04:41.763 --> 04:43.029
Dude, he is obsessed.

04:43.064 --> 04:45.498
So emotionally out of control.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.334
- Gosh, I miss that cute, shouty, red face.
- Stop.

04:48.369 --> 04:50.836
You both agreed that radio
silence was for the best.

04:50.872 --> 04:51.904
I guess.

04:51.940 --> 04:53.372
It's just so much harder than I thought.

04:53.408 --> 04:54.707
Well, tonight's Halloween party

04:54.742 --> 04:56.042
is the biggest rager of the year.

04:56.077 --> 04:57.076
Forget my lame brother.

04:57.111 --> 04:58.878
You're right. I'm
gonna go get my costume.

04:58.913 --> 04:59.879
Let's Barry.

05:00.715 --> 05:02.848
I mean party. Ugh!

05:04.085 --> 05:05.885
Pops, thank God you're here!

05:05.920 --> 05:08.554
There's a major crisis
between me and Jackie.

05:08.589 --> 05:10.323
Only my love guru can help.

05:10.358 --> 05:13.159
This is why I sit here waiting all day.

05:13.194 --> 05:14.660
Lay it on me, kiddo.

05:14.696 --> 05:16.162
Hang on to your hat.

05:16.197 --> 05:18.798
Turns out, Jackie likes "Star Trek"

05:18.833 --> 05:20.366
more than "Star Wars."

05:20.401 --> 05:21.467
What do I do?

05:21.502 --> 05:23.135
- About what?
- It's a fact.

05:23.171 --> 05:25.771
Force Freaks and
Trekkies never get along.

05:25.807 --> 05:27.039
We're sworn enemies.

05:27.075 --> 05:30.142
Okay, here's what you do.

05:30.178 --> 05:33.145
- Nothing. 'Cause it's all dumb.
- Dumb?!

05:33.181 --> 05:34.547
If I date a Trekkie,

05:34.582 --> 05:37.216
I lose all my street cred with my boys!

05:37.251 --> 05:39.151
And just where is this street,

05:39.187 --> 05:40.553
and who are these boys?

05:40.588 --> 05:42.054
Me and Jackie are doomed.

05:42.090 --> 05:44.357
There's no saving this relationship.

05:44.392 --> 05:45.191
Pardon me.

05:45.226 --> 05:46.425
I couldn't help but overhear

05:46.461 --> 05:48.427
through the vent in
the upstairs bathroom.

05:48.463 --> 05:51.497
Schmoo, if you want relationship advice,

05:51.532 --> 05:52.631
just look at me and your dad.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.401
We've been making it work for 25 years.

05:55.436 --> 05:56.569
Makin' it work!

05:56.604 --> 05:57.636
Sure, we bicker.

05:57.672 --> 05:59.939
But in the end, we always compromise.

05:59.974 --> 06:00.873
Right you are!

06:00.908 --> 06:02.375
There's no reason you can't do that

06:02.410 --> 06:03.876
with your space movies, right, Mur?

06:03.911 --> 06:05.144
When you're right, you're right, Bevy.

06:05.179 --> 06:06.512
He's a lug,

06:06.547 --> 06:07.646
but I love him.

06:07.682 --> 06:09.081
Lady loves a lug.

06:10.852 --> 06:11.917
Smack-diggity!

06:15.656 --> 06:17.289
Don't do a damn thing she said.

06:17.325 --> 06:18.357
Uh, what? But, I...

06:18.393 --> 06:19.859
Shut up, shut up! Listen to me.

06:19.894 --> 06:22.194
In any healthy relationship,
there is no compromise.

06:22.230 --> 06:24.130
- So what is there?
- Total defeat.

06:24.165 --> 06:25.097
Your only choice?

06:25.133 --> 06:26.532
- Become a shell of a man.
- What?

06:26.567 --> 06:28.367
That sounds like a horrible way to live.

06:28.403 --> 06:29.602
It is, but it works.

06:29.637 --> 06:32.038
It keeps your mom and I chugging along.

06:32.073 --> 06:33.139
And that's what I want with Jackie.

06:33.174 --> 06:34.240
To chug forever.

06:34.275 --> 06:37.209
Then meet me in your
room in five minutes.

06:37.245 --> 06:38.377
- Can't we just...
- No!

06:38.413 --> 06:39.812
It's not safe here!

06:40.915 --> 06:42.782
It's not safe.

06:42.817 --> 06:44.483
<i>While my dad was acting spooky,</i>

06:44.519 --> 06:47.053
<i>Barry was feeling haunted
by his own lost love.</i>

06:52.794 --> 06:55.494
Hello? Someone there?

07:01.702 --> 07:02.601
Lainey?!

07:04.439 --> 07:05.638
<i>I'm telling you!</i>

07:05.673 --> 07:09.375
I saw her clear as day in the Wawa.

07:09.410 --> 07:10.910
Dude, there's no way it was Lainey.

07:10.945 --> 07:12.011
She's with Erica, remember?

07:12.046 --> 07:13.179
Which is why

07:13.214 --> 07:15.081
there's only one other
logical explanation...

07:15.116 --> 07:16.782
I'm being haunted by the blonde spirit

07:16.818 --> 07:18.050
of my broken relationship.

07:18.086 --> 07:19.318
This is our fault.

07:19.353 --> 07:21.087
We tried to used the Ouija
to get you over Lainey,

07:21.122 --> 07:22.721
but instead, we just
got her into your head.

07:22.757 --> 07:23.722
No, Matthew.

07:23.758 --> 07:25.925
<i>You think it was all a game,</i>

07:25.960 --> 07:27.893
but much like the horror
masterpiece "Witchboard,"

07:27.929 --> 07:29.562
you've opened a portal
to the other side.

07:32.433 --> 07:33.766
Run home.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.468
Run home!

07:35.503 --> 07:36.869
There are ghosts everywhere!

07:36.904 --> 07:38.404
Enough, man!

07:38.439 --> 07:40.539
We were pushing around
a tiny plastic triangle

07:40.575 --> 07:41.674
I bought at a toy store.

07:41.709 --> 07:43.542
Which is exactly how
"Witchboard" started.

07:43.578 --> 07:45.478
- Oh, no!
- Dude, don't encourage him!

07:47.115 --> 07:48.447
When will you learn?!

07:48.483 --> 07:50.316
None of you are safe!

07:50.351 --> 07:51.417
Look at me, bro.

07:51.452 --> 07:54.286
There is no ghost of Lainey.

07:57.391 --> 07:58.424
We need to talk.

07:58.459 --> 08:00.392
Aah! It's a sexy ghost!

08:02.196 --> 08:03.896
<i>As my brother came face
to face with his past,</i>

08:03.931 --> 08:07.800
<i>my dad was gonna help me
secure my future with Jackie.</i>

08:07.835 --> 08:10.136
Son, today, I'm gonna pass on to you

08:10.171 --> 08:11.604
my greatest legacy...

08:11.639 --> 08:13.405
How to be a shell of a man.

08:13.441 --> 08:14.640
Your legacy seems sad.

08:14.675 --> 08:16.175
- This is all I've got.
- Totally fair.

08:16.210 --> 08:17.910
Lesson one,
the think 'n' nod.

08:17.945 --> 08:20.079
When your woman's
asking you your opinion,

08:20.114 --> 08:22.081
you act like you're thinking about it,

08:22.116 --> 08:23.482
and then you nod in agreement.

08:23.518 --> 08:25.618
But if my answer is always a dumb nod,

08:25.653 --> 08:26.819
won't Jackie catch on?

08:26.854 --> 08:27.987
You'd think so.

08:28.022 --> 08:29.922
But deep down, they
don't want our opinions.

08:29.957 --> 08:32.558
- But I...
- Lesson two, the smile and echo.

08:32.592 --> 08:34.592
Whenever your girl is jabbering on,

08:34.629 --> 08:35.961
you smile at her

08:35.996 --> 08:38.397
and then you echo the
last thing she says to you.

08:38.432 --> 08:39.865
That can't possibly work.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.033
Bevy, what was that thing

08:41.068 --> 08:42.801
you wanted me to do with the thing?!

08:42.837 --> 08:44.169
You mean shopping for towels?

08:44.205 --> 08:46.038
Yeah, shopping for towels.

08:46.073 --> 08:46.906
Don't you worry.

08:46.941 --> 08:48.707
I just picked up this adorable set

08:48.743 --> 08:49.775
from the clearance bin.

08:49.810 --> 08:51.076
Don't you love them?

08:51.112 --> 08:52.344
I love them!

08:52.380 --> 08:53.279
And I love you.

08:53.314 --> 08:55.181
In fact, I'm gonna go make you

08:55.216 --> 08:57.683
that butterscotch
pudding you like so much.

08:58.886 --> 08:59.852
See?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.020
I like getting along.

09:01.055 --> 09:02.087
I gotta take some notes!

09:02.123 --> 09:03.923
No, no! There can't be a paper trail!

09:03.958 --> 09:05.724
Don't worry, I'll write it in code.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.393
Question.

09:07.428 --> 09:09.962
Isn't it soul crushing to
never share your opinions?

09:09.997 --> 09:11.063
Sure.

09:11.098 --> 09:12.698
But that brings us
to our final lesson,

09:12.733 --> 09:14.433
- the tampening.
- The tampening?

09:14.468 --> 09:16.535
You tamp down all the rage and fury

09:16.571 --> 09:18.037
deep into your body like this.

09:18.072 --> 09:19.071
Watch.

09:23.811 --> 09:24.944
That can't be good for you.

09:24.979 --> 09:25.945
But the pudding helps.

09:26.614 --> 09:28.447
<i>Armed with my dad's shameful legacy,</i>

09:28.482 --> 09:31.217
<i>I decided to put his
love tips to the test.</i>

09:31.252 --> 09:33.552
Hey. There she is.

09:33.588 --> 09:34.853
Jackie!

09:34.889 --> 09:36.188
Crackerjack!

09:36.224 --> 09:37.389
Jack-o-lantern!

09:37.425 --> 09:39.024
Halloween!

09:39.060 --> 09:41.493
Hey, I know that we left things off

09:41.529 --> 09:42.695
on a weird note.

09:42.730 --> 09:44.230
Nah... We're good.

09:44.265 --> 09:46.432
<i>I was ready to finally become a man.</i>

09:46.467 --> 09:48.234
<i>By becoming a shell of one.</i>

09:48.269 --> 09:52.938
Actually, I've come around
on the "Star Trek" thing.

09:52.974 --> 09:53.806
Wait, really?

09:53.841 --> 09:55.307
You're gonna be my Spock?

09:55.343 --> 09:57.343
<i>And so, I hit Jackie
with each and every one</i>

09:57.378 --> 09:59.478
<i>of my dad's relationship techniques.</i>

09:59.513 --> 10:00.713
<i>I nodded...</i>

10:00.748 --> 10:02.348
- I'll... I'll be your Spock.
- Oh, my God!

10:02.383 --> 10:03.882
You're, like, the best boyfriend ever.

10:03.918 --> 10:06.218
<i>- ...and I echoed.
- I am, like, the best boyfriend ever.</i>

10:06.254 --> 10:07.486
<i>and finally...</i>

10:07.521 --> 10:10.222
I rented "Star Trek
IV: The Voyage Home."

10:10.258 --> 10:11.390
Should we watch it?

10:11.425 --> 10:13.392
Mm...

10:13.427 --> 10:15.427
<i>...And I tampened like
I'd never tampened before.</i>

10:15.463 --> 10:16.629
Come on.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.334
Yeah. I will watch your thing.

10:22.370 --> 10:24.603
<i>That day, I made my dad a proud man.</i>

10:24.639 --> 10:26.205
Okay.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.540
- And that's why I became a father.
- Really?

10:28.576 --> 10:29.708
You became a dad

10:29.744 --> 10:31.910
so you could teach your
son to be a jackass?

10:31.946 --> 10:33.946
Hey! There she is!

10:33.981 --> 10:35.214
Stop it!

10:35.249 --> 10:37.082
How could you teach him
all these terrible tricks?

10:37.118 --> 10:38.150
What tricks?

10:38.185 --> 10:40.786
The think 'n' nod? The smile and echo?

10:40.821 --> 10:41.854
How'd you learn about those tricks?

10:41.889 --> 10:43.155
Adam wrote 'em down!

10:43.190 --> 10:44.723
You cracked Adam's code?

10:44.759 --> 10:46.058
You mean just not using vowels?

10:46.093 --> 10:46.992
Yes.

10:47.028 --> 10:48.260
How could you teach our son

10:48.296 --> 10:50.229
that that's how our relationship works?

10:50.264 --> 10:52.131
<i>Because that is how it works.</i>

10:52.166 --> 10:55.467
You don't want my opinions
about how ugly your towels are.

10:55.503 --> 10:56.502
You hate my towels?

10:56.537 --> 10:58.437
Those towels are soft and beautiful.

10:58.472 --> 11:00.506
Mm, those towels are soft and beautiful.

11:00.541 --> 11:01.674
Well, thank you. I mean, that's...

11:01.709 --> 11:03.375
Oh, oh, gah! Stop it!

11:03.411 --> 11:04.310
All right, listen to me.

11:04.345 --> 11:05.811
No more being a shell of a man.

11:05.846 --> 11:07.846
From now on, you're gonna
be filled with opinions!

11:07.882 --> 11:09.148
- And pudding?
- No!

11:09.183 --> 11:11.984
I want your thoughts and
feelings on everything,

11:12.019 --> 11:14.119
so Adam can see how we compromise.

11:14.155 --> 11:15.788
Now we are gonna go to the store,

11:15.823 --> 11:17.623
<i>and you are gonna pick out the towels.</i>

11:17.658 --> 11:20.326
I told you not to write
it down, you moron!

11:20.361 --> 11:21.694
What's that all about?

11:21.729 --> 11:22.928
Who knows?

11:22.963 --> 11:25.097
Let's just focus on the
thing we both love...

11:25.132 --> 11:28.000
"Star Trek IV, Spock
Does San Francisco."

11:28.035 --> 11:29.635
You ruined a life today!

11:30.838 --> 11:33.072
<i>True. And yet, I saved my relationship.</i>

11:33.783 --> 11:35.570
<i>Thanks to my dad's tampening technique,</i>

11:35.752 --> 11:38.103
<i>I survived two whole
hours of "Star Trek"</i>

11:38.167 --> 11:39.094
<i>with my girlfriend.</i>

11:39.168 --> 11:41.102
You know what? This movie's right.

11:41.137 --> 11:43.004
We really do have to save the whales.

11:43.039 --> 11:45.406
We do have to save the whales!

11:45.441 --> 11:48.676
It's all so brilliant and preachy.

11:48.711 --> 11:51.012
No, no. Tamp it down.

11:51.047 --> 11:52.380
What?

11:54.550 --> 11:55.783
Love you!

11:55.818 --> 11:59.053
<i>Oh, sweet balls! I was
in science fiction hell.</i>

11:59.088 --> 12:01.656
<i>Meanwhile, Barry was back
in a Lainey-filled paradise.</i>

12:01.691 --> 12:03.925
<i>So that was you at the Wawa.</i>

12:03.960 --> 12:05.626
I thought you were
visiting Erica this weekend?

12:05.662 --> 12:07.128
I bailed and hopped a bus here.

12:07.163 --> 12:08.129
I just had to see you.

12:08.164 --> 12:09.263
I knew it!

12:09.299 --> 12:10.264
Let me finish, Barry.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.432
I came back to say this face to face.

12:11.467 --> 12:12.800
I'm in Georgia now.

12:12.835 --> 12:14.802
I've moved on. It's time
for you to move on, too.

12:14.837 --> 12:16.570
You're right.

12:16.606 --> 12:18.973
Thank you for being so
mature and understanding...

12:19.008 --> 12:20.942
<i>And so, they finally moved on.</i>

12:20.977 --> 12:22.576
<i>- Or not.
-Because I love you</i>

12:22.612 --> 12:23.844
and I want you back now!

12:23.880 --> 12:25.680
Say yes or I will literally die!

12:25.715 --> 12:27.248
I knew it again! Yes!

12:27.283 --> 12:28.616
Someone do something!

12:28.651 --> 12:30.785
Guys, we all know how hard it is,

12:30.820 --> 12:32.353
but don't just jump back into this

12:32.388 --> 12:33.988
without really thinking it through!

12:34.023 --> 12:35.156
Okay.

12:35.191 --> 12:36.190
<i>And think they did.</i>

12:36.225 --> 12:38.192
<i>Searching deep in their hearts.</i>

12:38.227 --> 12:39.226
<i>And then said screw it.</i>

12:39.262 --> 12:40.695
♪ Love lift us up where we belong ♪

12:40.730 --> 12:43.965
Guess who's back together
and in total love?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.199
[Bleep]

12:45.234 --> 12:47.268
♪ Where the eagles cry ♪

12:47.303 --> 12:48.135
Start clapping,

12:48.171 --> 12:50.004
or I'll fight everyone in this gym!

12:50.039 --> 12:52.506
♪ On a mountain high ♪

12:52.542 --> 12:54.942
<i>Barry and Lainey's love

<i>Meanwhile, I was looking like</i>

12:56.212 --> 12:58.546
<i>a dumb-ass Keebler Elf with a bowl cut!</i>

12:58.581 --> 13:00.448
Aww! You look as cute as a button.

13:00.483 --> 13:02.383
I do look as cute as a button.

13:02.418 --> 13:04.418
We're gonna have the
best Halloween ever.

13:04.454 --> 13:06.420
We are gonna have the
best Halloween ever.

13:06.456 --> 13:07.722
You're acting weird.

13:07.757 --> 13:09.423
I am acting weird.

13:09.459 --> 13:10.524
See?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.426
We agree on everything and you're happy.

13:12.462 --> 13:13.894
Hey, Adam!

13:13.930 --> 13:15.563
Come in the bathroom
and take a look at this!

13:15.598 --> 13:16.998
You won't believe it!

13:17.033 --> 13:18.599
Uh, I think we all have a sense

13:18.634 --> 13:20.201
of what you're capable of, Dad!

13:20.236 --> 13:21.302
Just get in here!

13:21.337 --> 13:22.370
See this?!

13:22.405 --> 13:24.705
We went shopping, I gave my opinion,

13:24.741 --> 13:27.074
and now I got the towel of my dreams!

13:27.110 --> 13:30.911
<i>Yep, all dad's love huge,
comfy, plain white towels,</i>

13:30.947 --> 13:32.947
<i>and this one was the stuff of legend.</i>

13:32.982 --> 13:35.850
You can wrap yourself in
it like it's a bedspread,

13:35.885 --> 13:37.485
but it's a towel.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.786
<i>Turns out my mom</i>

13:38.821 --> 13:40.521
<i>had some tampening skills of her own.</i>

13:40.556 --> 13:42.857
<i>And she used them to
desperately remain positive.</i>

13:42.892 --> 13:45.426
Fun fact, uh, it's so big,

13:45.461 --> 13:47.595
I can only wash one of those at a time!

13:48.631 --> 13:49.764
Your mom's right.

13:49.799 --> 13:52.566
This compromise thing,
it really does work!

13:52.602 --> 13:55.503
You can dry a van with it. Ah!

13:55.538 --> 13:57.171
I know I told you to blindly agree

13:57.206 --> 13:59.040
with all your girlfriend's stupid stuff,

13:59.075 --> 14:00.441
but guess what?

14:00.476 --> 14:02.476
They're desperate to
know how wrong they are!

14:02.512 --> 14:03.310
What?

14:03.346 --> 14:04.278
B... Nothing!

14:04.313 --> 14:06.547
Just a little family towel talk.

14:06.582 --> 14:08.582
Wait, wait. I'm wrong?

14:08.618 --> 14:09.550
Well, that does it.

14:09.585 --> 14:11.218
I'm bringing my towels back!

14:11.254 --> 14:13.187
No! This is our one towel now.

14:13.222 --> 14:14.355
It's all we need.

14:14.390 --> 14:15.923
So you just repeat everything I say

14:15.958 --> 14:17.158
just to patronize me?

14:17.193 --> 14:19.326
It's better than saying the
one thing you love the most

14:19.362 --> 14:20.928
is boring as balls!

14:20.963 --> 14:22.163
Boring as balls?

14:22.198 --> 14:23.564
You didn't even want my opinion.

14:23.599 --> 14:25.266
You just want everything on your terms!

14:25.301 --> 14:27.168
But my terms make sense,

14:27.203 --> 14:29.970
unlike the preposterous
size of that towel!

14:30.006 --> 14:32.406
Trekkies have four
movies and two TV shows,

14:32.442 --> 14:33.774
and all your people have

14:33.810 --> 14:35.876
is just a mere trilogy to sell toys.

14:35.912 --> 14:37.244
"You people"?

14:37.280 --> 14:40.114
Oh, wow! You went there pretty quick!

14:40.149 --> 14:42.650
This was never about my
big, thirsty towel, was it?

14:42.685 --> 14:44.752
It's about you preferring me as a shell.

14:44.787 --> 14:47.388
Fine. Take your giant towel!

14:47.423 --> 14:50.391
You can go dry a street
or suck up a river!

14:50.426 --> 14:51.725
I will never be your Trekkie!

14:51.761 --> 14:52.927
Ever!

14:52.962 --> 14:55.563
Well then, maybe you
shouldn't be my boyfriend!

14:55.598 --> 14:57.832
This is your fault!

14:57.867 --> 14:59.266
Hey, you ruined my thing, too.

14:59.302 --> 15:01.202
This is what I get for
modeling my relationship

15:01.237 --> 15:03.204
after two crazy people!

15:03.873 --> 15:04.839
I know he's upset,

15:04.874 --> 15:06.173
but we need to get Adam back in here.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.275
It's gonna take at least
three of us to fold this thing.

15:08.311 --> 15:10.077
<i>As two Goldberg relationships crumbled,</i>

15:10.113 --> 15:12.780
<i>one was still standing on two feet.</i>

15:12.815 --> 15:15.149
Hey, Bar? It's been an hour.

15:15.184 --> 15:16.517
I don't think you have to
keep carrying her around

15:16.552 --> 15:17.551
like she's Debra Winger.

15:17.587 --> 15:19.286
I'll carry Lainey in my arms

15:19.322 --> 15:20.788
until everyone in here knows

15:20.823 --> 15:23.164
I am the officer and
she is my gentleman!

15:23.330 --> 15:25.626
<i>-  Aww!
- Barry and Lainey were flying high,</i>

15:25.661 --> 15:26.961
<i>till reality crashed the party.</i>

15:26.996 --> 15:28.462
Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!

15:28.498 --> 15:29.663
- Erica?!
- Erica?! Aah!

15:29.699 --> 15:32.233
- Erica! So glad you're finally here!
- Hi, baby.

15:32.268 --> 15:33.868
Now our couples costume makes sense.

15:33.903 --> 15:35.703
See? I'm Marty McFly and you're his mom.

15:35.738 --> 15:37.037
Oh, boy, what have we done?

15:37.073 --> 15:37.838
What are you doing here?

15:37.874 --> 15:39.273
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

15:39.308 --> 15:41.442
We were by the keg chatting
up two hot frat guys,

15:41.477 --> 15:43.410
and then I turned
around and you were gone!

15:43.446 --> 15:44.745
This is probably a bad time,

15:44.780 --> 15:45.813
but you look super hot,

15:45.848 --> 15:47.414
even though you're technically my mom.

15:47.450 --> 15:49.116
Gross. But thanks.

15:49.152 --> 15:50.217
I'm sorry I ditched you,

15:50.253 --> 15:51.418
but I did leave a
note on the punch bowl.

15:51.454 --> 15:53.854
Oh, you mean this sticky red napkin

15:53.890 --> 15:55.422
that says "Bye"?

15:55.458 --> 15:57.324
I just came back here to
tell Barry it's totally over.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.261
But, in a surprising
twist, we got back together!

16:00.296 --> 16:02.129
- Aren't you happy for us?
- No!

16:02.165 --> 16:04.832
Long-distance relationships
are the worst and never work.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.000
Yes! Beating the odds!

16:06.035 --> 16:07.701
See? You guys make it work.

16:07.737 --> 16:09.603
Yeah, but we barely see each other.

16:09.639 --> 16:11.238
And our phone bills are out of control.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.506
I had to start mowing lawns.

16:12.542 --> 16:13.974
Manual labor?

16:14.010 --> 16:15.209
Big Tasty's more of

16:15.244 --> 16:17.411
a corner-office,
feet-up-on-the-desk kinda guy.

16:17.446 --> 16:18.879
Not to mention,

16:18.915 --> 16:20.981
we're just three hours
away from each other.

16:21.017 --> 16:23.450
Georgia's only...

16:23.486 --> 16:26.020
12 hours away.

16:26.055 --> 16:27.254
They're right, Barry.

16:27.290 --> 16:30.157
<i>And so, that dark Halloween night,</i>

16:30.193 --> 16:32.026
<i>Barry and Lainey finally saw the light.</i>

16:32.061 --> 16:33.661
It's over again.

16:33.696 --> 16:35.062
Oh, Lainey.

16:36.101 --> 16:37.144
<i>It may have been Halloween,</i>

16:37.310 --> 16:38.696
<i>but the scariest thing in our house</i>

16:38.834 --> 16:40.257
<i>was what was going on between my folks.</i>

16:40.542 --> 16:41.792
Dad, thank God you're here!

16:41.892 --> 16:43.885
There is a major crisis
between me and Murray

16:43.920 --> 16:44.789
and we need your help.

16:44.824 --> 16:47.325
Well, I'm 0 for 1, but
let's give it a shot.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.793
Great. Which towel do you like best?

16:48.828 --> 16:50.494
The entire life we've
built depends on it.

16:50.530 --> 16:51.796
Dammit!

16:51.831 --> 16:54.131
Why does everyone around
here fight over such nonsense?

16:54.167 --> 16:55.399
Do I really need to be here for this?

16:55.435 --> 16:58.336
Yes, you need to see how a
healthy relationship works!

16:58.371 --> 17:00.371
Pick my towel, Daddy!

17:00.406 --> 17:02.940
Well, this one is the ugliest
shade of brown I've ever seen.

17:02.976 --> 17:05.209
And this big one looks like
the sail of a clipper ship.

17:05.244 --> 17:07.645
- Gah! Who asked you?!
- You did!

17:07.680 --> 17:09.480
Can I go back to being sad and alone?

17:09.515 --> 17:10.781
No.

17:10.817 --> 17:14.050
Adam... I'm sorry we mixed in.

17:14.087 --> 17:15.185
The truth is,

17:15.221 --> 17:17.255
I talk a big game about compromise,

17:17.290 --> 17:18.556
but deep down...

17:20.126 --> 17:22.260
...I am a lady who
likes to call the shots.

17:22.295 --> 17:25.162
And deep down, I'm good with that.

17:25.198 --> 17:27.298
Really? You mean that, Mur?

17:27.333 --> 17:29.233
More than anything.

17:29.269 --> 17:31.636
See? We do compromise...

17:31.671 --> 17:33.571
- just in our own way.
- I get it.

17:33.606 --> 17:36.674
Even if it is super unhealthy
and a terrible example.

17:36.709 --> 17:37.742
But it works for us.

17:37.777 --> 17:39.143
And you and Jackie will figure out

17:39.178 --> 17:40.544
what works for you, too.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.179
<i>But deep in my heart, I already knew.</i>

17:42.215 --> 17:43.581
♪ Love lift us up where we belong ♪

17:43.616 --> 17:45.316
<i>That night, my crazy
parents made me realize</i>

17:45.351 --> 17:47.918
<i>there's no shortcuts when
it comes to relationships.</i>

17:47.954 --> 17:50.655
<i>And when it came to Jackie,
I'd do the unthinkable.</i>

17:50.690 --> 17:52.423
<i>I'd boldly go where no "Star Wars" fan</i>

17:52.458 --> 17:54.292
<i>had gone before.</i>

17:54.327 --> 17:55.293
Oh, it's you.

17:55.328 --> 17:56.894
What do you want?

17:56.929 --> 17:59.030
Look, you know I get all flustered,

17:59.065 --> 18:01.332
so I'm gonna let "Star
Trek" do all the talking.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.074

18:15.882 --> 18:18.416
You do know that that was
complete gibberish, right?

18:18.451 --> 18:19.483
I tried learning Klingon.

18:19.519 --> 18:21.886
- For me?
- Yeah.

18:21.921 --> 18:24.889
All I'm trying to say is...

18:24.924 --> 18:25.956
I love you.

18:25.992 --> 18:27.758
I know.

18:27.794 --> 18:29.760
Wait, are you quoting
the Carbonite scene

18:29.796 --> 18:30.828
from "Empire Strikes Back"?

18:30.863 --> 18:32.730
I am quoting the Carbonite scene

18:32.765 --> 18:33.931
from "Empire Strikes Back."

18:33.966 --> 18:36.434
Okay, that's the smile 'n' echo.

18:36.469 --> 18:38.636
<i>With that, me and Jackie were back.</i>

18:38.671 --> 18:41.472
<i>But for my brother,
love had no easy answer.</i>

18:41.507 --> 18:43.174
Hi, Mr. Ouija.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.608
I know this is asking a lot,

18:44.644 --> 18:46.477
but please,

18:46.512 --> 18:48.412
we need to know.

18:48.448 --> 18:50.181
Will we end up together?

18:51.584 --> 18:53.150
<i>Sometimes the hardest thing about love</i>

18:53.186 --> 18:56.187
<i>is realizing no one has all the answers.</i>

18:56.222 --> 18:57.822
I was really hoping it would work.

18:57.857 --> 18:59.657
Us, or the Ouija?

18:59.692 --> 19:00.858
Both.

19:03.096 --> 19:05.930
I'll always love you, Barry Goldberg.

19:05.965 --> 19:07.298
You know that, right?

19:13.072 --> 19:14.739
<i>Truth is,</i>

19:14.774 --> 19:17.208
<i>there's no trick to making
a relationship perfect.</i>

19:17.243 --> 19:18.743
Looks like you got through to them.

19:18.778 --> 19:19.977
Well done.

19:20.012 --> 19:22.279
Why do I feel so lousy?

19:22.315 --> 19:23.614
'Cause you were right.

19:23.649 --> 19:26.517
Long distance really does suck.

19:26.552 --> 19:27.818
But it's worth it.

19:27.854 --> 19:29.754
At least for us.

19:29.789 --> 19:31.322
And how can you be so sure?

19:37.330 --> 19:38.396
Does that answer your question?

19:38.431 --> 19:39.463
For sure. It's totally worth it.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.933
That towel takes up half the closet.

19:42.969 --> 19:44.468
You know what?

19:44.504 --> 19:45.636
I think it's growing on me.

19:47.874 --> 19:50.141
<i>Sure, there will always
be bumps along the way...</i>

19:50.176 --> 19:52.376
<i>...but when you find
that perfect person...</i>

19:52.412 --> 19:54.445
<i>there's nothing better in the universe.</i>

19:54.480 --> 19:57.415
Adam: Admit it. You like
"Star Wars" a little.

19:57.450 --> 19:58.849
These buns are kind of growing on me.

20:01.888 --> 20:11.862
_

20:17.799 --> 20:19.905
<i>Okay, we've been through this a lot.</i>

20:20.142 --> 20:22.401
I just... I want you to
relax, just be in the moment,

20:22.587 --> 20:23.837
and for the love of God,

20:24.006 --> 20:25.598
act like you've been there.

20:25.634 --> 20:26.733
Which I have.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.234
So, it's so strange
that I keep acting like

20:28.270 --> 20:29.302
I have yet to be there.

20:29.337 --> 20:31.004
Bad start. Here we go.

20:34.709 --> 20:35.809
That's an A+.

20:35.844 --> 20:37.277
4.0 GPA!

20:37.312 --> 20:38.778
Hittin' the books, makin' the grades!

20:40.148 --> 20:41.181
That is some quality craftsmanship.

20:41.216 --> 20:42.348
Hand sewn!

20:42.384 --> 20:43.716
Rich Corinthian leather!

20:44.186 --> 20:45.351
Great stuff, fine work.

20:45.387 --> 20:46.586
Not work, play.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.022
All work and no play
makes Adam a dull boy.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.091
Hello, Nurse!

20:52.127 --> 20:53.927
The doctor's in!

20:53.962 --> 20:55.662
Your prescription's ready!

20:55.697 --> 20:56.696
You know what?

20:56.731 --> 21:01.291
- Let's just pick this back up tomorrow?
- That seems reasonable.
