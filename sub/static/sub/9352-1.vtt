02:28.590 --> 02:31.368
My country men,
our voice must be heard.

02:31.593 --> 02:34.174
Japan belongs to the people,
not the military.

02:34.395 --> 02:37.805
We must end the military occupation
Of Shanghai!

02:38.065 --> 02:40.363
Hey, look.
The Kokureeu Clan is coming.

02:51.510 --> 02:54.636
Memorize this.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.699
Point one...

02:56.881 --> 02:59.626
concerns the dispersion
of lubricants around the engine.

02:59.851 --> 03:03.740
Point two is the mechanics, the pistons
And the function of the carburetor.

03:04.021 --> 03:07.910
All the functions I have covered today
Will be included in the final exam.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.537
That's all.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.127
- What's going on here?
- Chinaman, get out!

03:37.417 --> 03:39.105
You can't do this!

03:39.284 --> 03:41.583
Japan is only
for the Japanese!

03:41.787 --> 03:45.099
- Take your war somewhere else!
- What?

03:53.631 --> 03:57.008
- You've got no right to do this.
- Oh, yeah?

03:59.535 --> 04:02.792
Stop it! There was no reason
For you to push him like that.

04:04.039 --> 04:06.076
What? I'll push who I want to.

04:06.275 --> 04:08.508
My uncle
will hear about you.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.194
Then we'll see
just how tough you are.

04:13.247 --> 04:15.066
Idiot!

04:15.249 --> 04:19.498
All right. I couldn't care less
About you or your uncle.

04:19.786 --> 04:23.523
You've got till three
to get lost. One!

04:23.790 --> 04:25.445
Two!

04:25.624 --> 04:27.345
Three!

04:27.526 --> 04:31.742
- Get him!

05:09.162 --> 05:10.982
Let me help!

05:18.070 --> 05:19.890
M-Master Sensai.

05:20.072 --> 05:24.158
He's the Kokureeu Sensai,
and he's also my uncle.

05:24.442 --> 05:28.745
So, I hope you've learned something
from your visit to this class.

05:29.046 --> 05:33.382
Brutality, as I've taught you,
has never been the way to win a battle.

05:33.683 --> 05:37.355
Professor, I do apologize.

05:47.697 --> 05:51.008
Be still. You're lucky that
you weren't seriously hurt.

05:51.266 --> 05:54.044
- Aah!
- What happened?

05:54.269 --> 05:57.493
It was my fault.

05:57.739 --> 06:01.410
Oh! Is it really?

06:01.676 --> 06:03.299
Impressive.

06:03.477 --> 06:06.440
I am Funakoshi Fumio.
And you are?

06:10.450 --> 06:14.666
Don't tell me that's the one
your father gave you?

06:14.954 --> 06:19.202
Oh, yes, it is. He paid a lot
for this pen. Now look at it.

06:19.491 --> 06:23.130
- What will we tell Daddy?
- Dear, let's not tell him anything.

06:23.395 --> 06:27.066
There's really no need
to make him angry.

06:27.331 --> 06:29.433
My students
will take care of it.

06:31.968 --> 06:36.217
Mitsuko, dear, here you are.
That's better.

06:36.505 --> 06:39.632
You're just as demanding
as your father, and just as stubborn.

06:39.876 --> 06:41.695
Young men don't like
stubborn women.

06:41.877 --> 06:44.045
Thank you, but I know
One young man that does.

06:44.246 --> 06:48.462
- Him?
- Sir. My name is Chen Zhen.

06:48.749 --> 06:51.462
- Chen Zhen from Jing Wu?
- Yes.

06:51.686 --> 06:54.267
- Who was your Master there?
- It was Master Hou.

06:57.090 --> 06:58.910
Oh, no.

06:59.091 --> 07:01.259
What is it, Uncle?

07:01.460 --> 07:06.373
I-- Last night
in the local newspaper--

07:09.100 --> 07:13.403
The article said that
your Master was killed...

07:13.705 --> 07:15.524
in a match.

07:15.707 --> 07:18.485
He fought with
one of the Niguchi Clan...

07:18.709 --> 07:20.649
to his death.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.132
I don't believe it!

07:27.382 --> 07:30.476
I am sorry.
I know you must be deeply hurt.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.572
Excuse me, sir.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.624
Master Hou's death
is a very great loss.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.783
Chen Zhen?
Where are you going?

07:54.006 --> 07:56.849
To Shanghai.
Master Hou was like a father to me.

07:57.075 --> 08:00.070
It's because his killer was Japanese.
That's why you're so angry.

08:00.312 --> 08:03.983
Stop the occupation of China!
Free Shanghai!

08:29.470 --> 08:33.904
Do you know just how badly I want
to come along with you on your journey?

08:37.211 --> 08:39.116
Chen Zhen!

08:39.313 --> 08:43.650
I'll wait for you.
You know I will.

08:43.951 --> 08:48.581
When the Japanese soldiers
are out of Shanghai, then I'll return.

08:48.888 --> 08:52.560
Our leaders can be
very hard to persuade, you know.

08:52.824 --> 08:56.168
Then we'll be
extremely persuasive.

08:56.428 --> 08:59.107
We'll make your leaders
listen to us.

08:59.330 --> 09:03.285
Chen Zhen, don't hate us all.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.155
I don't hate.

09:07.604 --> 09:10.088
Mitsuko, it must be this way.

09:10.306 --> 09:12.245
I have no choice.

09:12.442 --> 09:15.057
Take care.

09:16.545 --> 09:19.029
Chen Zhen!

10:08.924 --> 10:12.018
Sorry, kids.
That's all I have.

10:12.260 --> 10:14.842
Go away now.

10:15.062 --> 10:18.156
- I'm just a student.
- Money, please, sir.

10:18.399 --> 10:21.874
I don't have
anything else for you.

10:22.135 --> 10:25.447
- Please, go and find someone else.
- Go on. Get out of here!

10:25.705 --> 10:27.938
- Ohayo.
- I am not Japanese.

10:28.141 --> 10:31.332
You're not?
Excuse me.

10:31.576 --> 10:33.809
Okay, right this way.

10:34.012 --> 10:36.495
- Where are you going?
- To Jing Wu.

10:36.715 --> 10:39.678
To Jing Wu,
the kung fu school?

10:39.917 --> 10:42.302
That's right.
I study kung fu.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.265
- What's the matter?
- Where have you been?
Haven't you heard?

10:45.489 --> 10:48.615
You better find a new place
to learn kung fu.

10:48.858 --> 10:52.268
Since their number one Master died,
their reputation is in the gutter.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.175
- Absurd. I'll find another rickshaw.
- Take it easy.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.217
I'll drive you there.

10:57.399 --> 11:01.222
Just don't be surprised if the doors
are closed. Okay, here we go.

11:20.252 --> 11:22.965
You know,
the Master here was killed...

11:23.189 --> 11:25.291
and now the pupils
are leaving.

11:25.490 --> 11:28.867
Hey, don't you know?
The Japanese want this place real bad.

11:29.127 --> 11:31.676
You hear?
Forget it.

11:31.895 --> 11:35.338
Chen Zhen!
What are you doing here?

11:35.598 --> 11:37.418
- Let me help.
- Thank you.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.685
- Ah, so you're--
- Chen Zhen from Jing Wu.

11:41.971 --> 11:43.790
The best.

11:44.795 --> 11:47.344
Keep the change.

11:50.732 --> 11:54.043
You heard what I said!

12:07.811 --> 12:10.937
Master Ngai,
this place is sacred to us.

12:11.181 --> 12:14.078
If you want to fight,
let's go outside.

13:09.323 --> 13:11.555
Master, are you all right?

13:11.758 --> 13:14.601
A good fight.
Thank you, sir.

13:14.827 --> 13:18.466
- For what? Target practice?
- Hey, understand something.

13:18.730 --> 13:22.553
If you're looking for a fight
At Jing Wu, you are asking for trouble.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.218
You or the Japanese.

13:25.434 --> 13:28.113
Huh.

13:32.306 --> 13:34.125
Is school out?

13:38.910 --> 13:41.557
Welcome.
Glad you're back.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.700
Uncle Nang.

13:44.882 --> 13:48.291
I was hoping to tell you about him
when school was over.

13:48.551 --> 13:51.263
How'd you hear?

13:51.487 --> 13:53.371
A Japanese newspaper.

13:55.623 --> 13:58.684
They printed it
with pleasure!

13:58.924 --> 14:01.767
Well, pay your respects to him.

14:01.994 --> 14:03.932
Let's go.

14:12.334 --> 14:14.469
Wait a minute.
You can't.

14:14.669 --> 14:17.534
He shouldn't wear that.
He's not family.

14:20.007 --> 14:23.645
Uncle, Chen Zhen was raised as a son.
You know that.

14:23.910 --> 14:26.904
He has the right,
same as you and me. Ah.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.766
He should not have fought
that day.

14:35.985 --> 14:38.282
I knew something was wrong.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.588
I saw it.

14:40.789 --> 14:42.608
We all did.

14:46.692 --> 14:48.924
Go ahead, now.

15:15.079 --> 15:17.922
What are you doing?
That's our symbol for acceptance.

15:18.148 --> 15:20.283
Hey, Uncle.

15:20.483 --> 15:22.814
Chen Zhen's right.

15:23.018 --> 15:25.218
Our enemies
have taken away our Master.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.653
They control our leaders.

15:27.855 --> 15:32.104
So, there can no longer be acceptance.
They have proven that now.

15:48.903 --> 15:50.723
Where are you going?

15:50.904 --> 15:52.876
To the Niguchi.

15:53.073 --> 15:56.068
Chen Zhen, revenge is
against the law, you know.

15:56.309 --> 15:58.280
Well, then...
I'll break the law.

15:58.477 --> 16:00.329
- Chen Zhen! No.
- Chen Zhen!

16:00.511 --> 16:05.424
Ting En, you know, you've been
there before. It's a fortress.

16:05.748 --> 16:08.330
They must have a hundred men.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.652
- Don't forget that you're the Master.
- But, Uncle--

16:10.853 --> 16:12.857
Hey, that's enough.

16:13.054 --> 16:14.873
I'm responsible for you.

16:16.389 --> 16:19.646
Cheung, Biu, take some men
and follow him.

16:19.892 --> 16:21.711
Yes, sir.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.194
- Sixth precinct. May I help you?
- Ah, that looks good.

16:28.397 --> 16:30.695
All right, go on.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.416
Captain, for you.

16:33.635 --> 16:35.868
Ah, what now?

16:36.070 --> 16:38.238
Captain speaking.

16:38.439 --> 16:40.258
Niguchi Arena?

16:42.575 --> 16:45.864
By himself?
Yes. Got it.

16:46.110 --> 16:49.813
To the Japanese compound.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.313
One! Two!

16:52.515 --> 16:55.925
Three! Four!

16:56.184 --> 16:58.068
- Idiot! Practice!
- Yes, sir.

16:58.253 --> 17:00.072
Dismissed.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.877
Look! Look!

17:14.797 --> 17:17.791
Take your Chinese shoes
and get out of here!

17:18.032 --> 17:21.443
I am Chen Zhen.
Where is Akutagawa?

17:21.702 --> 17:25.079
Hey, you.
Niguchi owns this place. Go!

17:25.338 --> 17:28.147
I'm not going anywhere
till Akutagawa comes.

17:28.374 --> 17:31.217
What? Ooh, come on!

18:35.356 --> 18:37.621
Aah!

19:13.951 --> 19:16.696
Where is your Master now?

19:16.920 --> 19:18.892
I want to see him.

19:27.594 --> 19:29.761
We shall challenge
each other...

19:29.962 --> 19:32.227
openly and fairly.

19:32.431 --> 19:37.725
If one of us dies,
there will be no revenge.

19:51.211 --> 19:53.412
Master fought you
with the Hou Fist.

19:53.612 --> 19:55.616
It would be his wish
for me to do the same.

21:14.672 --> 21:18.114
He'd have beaten you
If he had been healthy.

21:42.524 --> 21:45.998
Only Japanese citizens
and those with special passes
are allowed to enter here.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.231
Ah.

21:48.429 --> 21:50.945
You heard what he said.
Chen can't be in there.

21:51.164 --> 21:52.983
But I swear I saw him
go in there myself!.

21:53.165 --> 21:55.582
Yeah, so did I.
Hey, there he is!

21:55.801 --> 21:58.164
Tell us what happened?

21:58.369 --> 22:01.179
- You Japanese?
- Chinese.

22:10.411 --> 22:13.820
-Attention!

22:34.495 --> 22:37.490
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

22:37.730 --> 22:40.028
Not at all.
General Fujita, sir.

22:40.232 --> 22:44.731
- Mr. Ambassador, it's nothing.
- Move it, now.

22:45.035 --> 22:47.365
Yes, sir.

22:50.774 --> 22:52.593
Company, march!

22:58.278 --> 23:01.273
- Did you beat him?
- I did.

23:01.514 --> 23:05.534
- Go tell Ting En to meet me
and the others at Master's grave.
- Right. I'll go.

23:05.817 --> 23:08.180
- But it isn't finished yet.
- I know.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.521
That's it. Keep it even.
A little higher.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.822
Watch the back.
Watch the side. Up.

23:13.022 --> 23:14.842
- Come on. More.
- Steady.

23:15.023 --> 23:16.842
- A little more. No, down there.
- Careful.

23:21.562 --> 23:23.414
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

23:25.398 --> 23:28.295
Doctor, go ahead.

23:45.868 --> 23:48.547
I'm a doctor,
not a pathologist.

23:48.770 --> 23:51.035
Let me.

23:51.238 --> 23:55.507
- What doyou need?
- I need the liver ifyou
want me to check for poison.

23:57.708 --> 24:00.125
- Stop them!
- Huh?

24:00.343 --> 24:03.272
- What are they doing here?
- Testing. Why?

24:03.511 --> 24:05.612
- Testing for what?
- What do you think?

24:05.813 --> 24:09.385
- Chen Zhen believes the Japanese
might have poisoned him.
- What?

24:09.649 --> 24:14.245
- Chen Zhen, I can't believe
that he was poisoned.
- Why not?

24:14.551 --> 24:18.189
If I beat Akutagawa easily,
he would have done it also.

24:18.453 --> 24:21.992
Captain, do you think
that he was poisoned?

24:22.255 --> 24:25.413
The first time he got hit really hard,
did you notice how weak he became?

24:25.658 --> 24:29.132
All right. But do we
have to do this in public?

24:29.393 --> 24:31.212
- Here.
- What?

24:31.394 --> 24:35.184
Take this. You'll have to kill me
If you want me to stop this.

24:35.462 --> 24:37.727
I want to know the truth.

24:37.932 --> 24:40.447
Master would want us to know
who took his life.

24:40.666 --> 24:42.485
Hey! Uh, uh--

25:04.279 --> 25:07.241
Thorazide.
A most deadly poison.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.810
- What?
- He was poisoned.

25:10.015 --> 25:13.391
Uh, but who could've done this?

25:13.650 --> 25:15.469
It's up to you
to find that out.

25:15.652 --> 25:20.378
- Now give us a hand. You can see
the Master needs our help.
- Sure.

25:20.689 --> 25:23.204
- All right. Let's go.
- Come on, you guys.

25:23.423 --> 25:26.320
I knew it. Akutagawa couldn't
have beaten him so easily.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.791
That's right.
Now we have to find out who did it.

25:28.994 --> 25:33.263
You know, it's a good thing
Chen was here. Otherwise,
we wouldn't even know.

25:35.581 --> 25:38.326
It makes no sense
that someone would do this.

25:38.549 --> 25:41.925
Maybe somebody slipped him poison
while he was outside the school.

25:42.184 --> 25:45.473
Impossible. He stayed inside
the gates here for one whole month.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.617
- We were right beside him.
- That's right.

25:48.855 --> 25:51.697
Then somebody from Jing Wu
must've done it.

25:54.458 --> 25:56.723
- Ah, Xiao Wei.
- Huh?

25:56.925 --> 25:59.790
You cooked for Master sometimes,
didn't you?

26:00.028 --> 26:03.088
- Uh-huh. So what?
- Mm-mmm.

26:03.330 --> 26:05.714
Uncle Nang, you don't think
it was Xiao Wei?

26:05.931 --> 26:07.749
No.

26:07.932 --> 26:11.722
But it could be someone else
from the kitchen.

26:12.001 --> 26:13.820
I do!

26:14.002 --> 26:18.217
So now you want to start
slinging accusations? Accusing me?

26:20.106 --> 26:24.255
Cheung, go search my kitchen to see
If there's any poisons in there.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.950
- Uncle, don't be so angry.
- Stay out of this! Go on!

26:28.210 --> 26:31.400
Just see for yourself if
I have anything poisonous in there.

26:31.645 --> 26:34.422
Go on! Take a good look!

26:34.647 --> 26:36.553
Uncle, this is crazy.

26:36.748 --> 26:39.329
Damn right,
suspecting people like me!

26:39.550 --> 26:41.880
Do you think
it might be the cook?

26:42.085 --> 26:46.234
I don't think so. The cook has been
around a long time. He loved my father.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.459
Hey, now, no one
is blaming you for it.

26:48.655 --> 26:52.162
Why not? I'm responsible
for all the food that we eat!

26:52.423 --> 26:56.888
All the food that is served.
Every bowl of rice on this table.

26:57.193 --> 27:00.319
So why don't you accuse me directly,
face-to-face?

27:00.561 --> 27:03.785
-Just a minute.
- All right, that's enough. Let's eat.

27:04.030 --> 27:06.447
Chen Zhen, the food
could be poisoned.

27:06.665 --> 27:09.027
Yes, it could be.
That's true.

27:09.233 --> 27:13.219
Since we all eat what Master ate,
why aren't we all dead? Huh?

27:13.502 --> 27:17.008
This is true. What do you
have to say about this, huh?

27:17.271 --> 27:19.852
- Accusing me.
- Sit down. Eat with us.

27:20.072 --> 27:23.513
All right. By all means,
let's enjoy the food.

27:23.775 --> 27:26.965
- It is safe to eat.
- Yeah, go on.

27:29.578 --> 27:33.183
You know,
I wanna go see Dr. Smith.

27:33.445 --> 27:37.051
I wanna know exactly
how Master was poisoned.

27:37.315 --> 27:40.985
- Then what?
- Then we'll know who did it.

27:41.250 --> 27:44.179
Uh-huh.

27:51.822 --> 27:54.664
- What's he doing?
- It's new.

28:00.862 --> 28:03.159
Did he learn it in Japan?

28:03.362 --> 28:05.627
- What is it?
- Good!

28:05.831 --> 28:08.989
I don't know.
In Japan.

28:10.667 --> 28:13.346
Good.

28:15.571 --> 28:18.054
Master Chen, if you're through
warming up, let's do some sparring.

28:18.271 --> 28:20.090
- Yeah, let's go. Come on.
- All right!

28:20.272 --> 28:21.611
- Okay, yeah.
- Let's go.

28:40.683 --> 28:42.981
Power, precision.

28:43.185 --> 28:45.221
And don't forget about speed.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.197
If you practice every day
with these things in mind...

28:48.422 --> 28:51.711
then you'll begin to develop
a fighting mode, see?

28:51.957 --> 28:56.106
What I'm trying to say is,
it's instinctive.

28:56.392 --> 28:59.518
All of these things
will allow us to take a hit.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.276
But what about
attacking the opponent first?

29:02.496 --> 29:05.338
Let's say you attack an opponent
with a strong defense.

29:05.563 --> 29:09.299
What happens? Bang! He hits you.
Now what? Have a strategy.

29:09.566 --> 29:11.799
Sister, they want
to enroll here.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.266
Uh-huh. There's so much talk
of Master Chen's ability.

29:14.469 --> 29:16.353
Yeah. We want to study
with him, okay?

29:16.537 --> 29:20.620
Students here must learn
from Ting En. His style has
as much power as Chen Zhen's.

29:20.906 --> 29:23.803
What's that?

29:24.041 --> 29:26.339
- Four leg form.
- It's too unstable.

29:26.542 --> 29:30.049
- Try to kick. Go on, kick.
- Yeah, right.

29:31.512 --> 29:34.354
Now, try this.
Put your weight here.

29:34.580 --> 29:37.890
- It's very simple. There's strength.
- All right, you've got it.

29:38.148 --> 29:41.687
-Japanese style.
- Yeah, sure, go on. Show us.

29:41.951 --> 29:44.151
- Okay.

29:44.352 --> 29:47.413
- Here, bring it over.
- All right, get set.

29:53.590 --> 29:56.967
- Amazing.
- See what I mean?

29:57.226 --> 29:59.132
- Great! You're great!
- Now you try it.

30:14.268 --> 30:16.087
Ting En?

30:20.172 --> 30:23.166
- What is it?
- Where are you going?

30:23.407 --> 30:27.230
- It's late.
- Mmm. Don't go yet.

30:27.509 --> 30:30.221
I have to.
I'm the Master.

30:30.444 --> 30:32.676
If you'd let me move in
with you at Jing Wu...

30:32.879 --> 30:37.126
you wouldn't ever have to
go anywhere, would you?

30:37.415 --> 30:40.758
I know, but you can't live there.

30:41.017 --> 30:43.946
Ooh, you promised me...

30:44.185 --> 30:46.515
that you'd tell them
about us soon.

30:46.719 --> 30:51.184
So, will you? Hmm?

30:52.295 --> 30:55.039
- At the right time.
- Mmm.

30:59.345 --> 31:02.154
I want to know everything
they're doing.

31:08.048 --> 31:11.522
Oh! You're spying
on our own people!

31:11.783 --> 31:14.560
There will always be traitors
who will try to go against us.

31:21.553 --> 31:23.371
Sorry.

31:23.554 --> 31:26.646
- I'm late.
- So you're here.

31:26.889 --> 31:30.231
I thought you'd be too tired,
or even too embarrassed.

31:30.490 --> 31:33.006
I don't know why you came.
No one wants you around here.

31:36.659 --> 31:39.718
I just wanted to know
about the autopsy.

31:42.695 --> 31:47.867
The Jing Wu Master,
Master Hou, was he poisoned?

31:48.196 --> 31:50.331
All of you,
you can leave now.

31:56.534 --> 31:59.974
What? It's something
they can't hear?

32:00.236 --> 32:02.565
Huh?

32:02.770 --> 32:06.537
You poisoned
The Jing Wu Master!

32:06.805 --> 32:10.790
The Chinese Resistance
was led by their Master.

32:11.073 --> 32:13.173
We knew that without him...

32:13.373 --> 32:16.781
the Resistance would be
quickly annihilated.

32:17.042 --> 32:21.670
We were depending on you, my friend,
to destroy the Fist of Legend.

32:21.977 --> 32:25.352
You couldn't.
You'd have failed.

32:25.612 --> 32:29.216
Therefore,
we did it ourselves.

32:29.479 --> 32:31.297
Poisoners!

32:31.480 --> 32:33.516
But you must admit...

32:33.714 --> 32:38.560
-it gets the job done.
- You have no conscience,
but I am a samurai.

32:40.417 --> 32:45.774
I thought we would do battle
according to our honor!

32:46.118 --> 32:49.243
You made him sick
with your poison.

32:49.486 --> 32:51.653
You are not worthy
Of the samurai spirit!

32:51.853 --> 32:54.183
Hah!

33:00.091 --> 33:02.736
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

33:02.958 --> 33:05.734
Let me tell you
about samurai spirit.

33:05.959 --> 33:09.116
It has nothing to do with honor,
but survival...

33:09.361 --> 33:11.844
and the total domination
of our enemies.

33:13.997 --> 33:15.140
It's good, but then--
Watch.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.780
- That's it.
- Here. I'll show you
the right way to do it.

33:17.998 --> 33:19.849
Now watch this.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.883
Uncle, according to
the doctor's report...

33:22.067 --> 33:24.299
Master was poisoned with a drug
that affected his lungs.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.765
- See, it's easy.
- That's right.

33:26.967 --> 33:31.627
He would have found it
impossible to breathe at all.

33:33.336 --> 33:36.232
Doyou still think
someone from Jing Wu did it?

33:39.739 --> 33:42.700
Chen Zhen, why are you here?

33:42.940 --> 33:46.249
Uncle Nang,
what are you saying?

33:46.508 --> 33:51.103
For the last two days,
all of the students here have
done nothing but admire you.

33:52.477 --> 33:54.296
You see that?

33:56.779 --> 34:00.350
How do you think
Ting En feels?

34:00.613 --> 34:02.813
About what?

34:03.014 --> 34:05.660
Everything that
you've been teaching...

34:05.881 --> 34:09.648
goes against
what Ting En has taught.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.735
Chen Zhen...

34:14.318 --> 34:17.541
you do realize
that Ting En...

34:17.786 --> 34:20.563
is still the only Master
at this school.

34:24.987 --> 34:27.797
Keep it in mind.

34:39.393 --> 34:42.072
- Master Chen, are you going jogging?
- That's right.

34:42.295 --> 34:44.114
At this hour?

34:49.898 --> 34:52.446
- Master Chen! Hey, slow down.
- Yeah?

34:52.666 --> 34:56.368
I brought all my friends.
Look, they all want to run with you.

34:56.632 --> 34:58.734
- Let's go.

34:58.935 --> 35:00.754
I don't believe this.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.319
That's what I heard, anyway.

35:11.039 --> 35:12.857
What's it say?

35:14.373 --> 35:17.530
Akutagawa!
He's dead!

35:25.144 --> 35:28.073
Stop! Don't do this.
Violence is no solution.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.814
General?

35:32.980 --> 35:35.757
Go!

35:52.488 --> 35:55.232
- Good morning, Master.
- Mmm.

35:59.723 --> 36:02.020
You've been gone
the whole night.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.466
- Chen Zhen?
- He's gone out running.

36:09.026 --> 36:12.183
If you see him, let me know.

36:21.998 --> 36:25.569
They're here!
The Japanese are here!

36:25.833 --> 36:27.684
Over there.

36:27.867 --> 36:29.490
- It's the Japanese.
- I see.

36:33.102 --> 36:36.836
- Lin, go and get the police.
Hurry up now.
- Right.

36:42.005 --> 36:45.098
- What do you want?
- Chen Zhen. Hand him over.

36:45.340 --> 36:49.261
Chen Zhen? Impossible.

36:49.541 --> 36:53.047
He might be...
Out beating someone.

36:53.309 --> 36:55.193
A karate master or a samurai.

36:55.377 --> 36:57.511
Quiet!

36:57.711 --> 36:59.976
You will hand him over to me
to be punished...

37:00.179 --> 37:02.824
for the murder of Akutagawa.

37:03.045 --> 37:06.301
That's not possible.
You know he didn't do it.

37:06.547 --> 37:10.979
So you say. Give him to me
and I'll prove it. Or let's fight!

37:11.283 --> 37:14.408
That's why you came here?
Draw your weapons.

37:15.451 --> 37:17.585
Close it!

37:36.491 --> 37:38.756
Aah!

37:56.633 --> 37:58.451
Help protect the shrine!

39:00.923 --> 39:03.852
- Arrest him!
- You are not in command.

39:09.260 --> 39:12.482
Police!

39:14.928 --> 39:17.345
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

39:19.796 --> 39:21.897
Sabers.

39:24.121 --> 39:27.627
- You're Niguchi students. Go home!
- But why? Send them to jail.

39:27.888 --> 39:30.849
Then I have to arrest you.
Is that what you want?

39:31.089 --> 39:33.866
We won't go...
till you give us Chen.

39:34.090 --> 39:36.061
Show me some respect.

39:36.257 --> 39:39.099
Bullshit!

39:41.660 --> 39:43.086
- Chen!
- Huh?

39:46.828 --> 39:48.711
Nobody move.

39:51.095 --> 39:53.959
Yeah?
You will shoot me ifI move?

39:54.197 --> 39:57.866
Oh, not me.
But my pistol might misfire.

39:58.131 --> 40:02.084
Put down your weapons.
Arrest Chen.

40:02.365 --> 40:04.183
- Go!
- Why are you arresting him?

40:04.366 --> 40:06.249
We want to question him
in connection with the killing.

40:06.433 --> 40:09.111
- Hey, why me? I didn't--
- Let's go!

40:09.334 --> 40:11.153
- Wait! Wait!
- Move! Move!

40:11.334 --> 40:14.046
Go! Go!
Get out!

40:14.268 --> 40:17.393
Go back to Japan!
We'll see who the murderer is!

40:34.142 --> 40:36.722
Don't worry.
It'll be okay. You'll see.

40:36.942 --> 40:39.077
Hey, everybody,
listen to me.

40:39.276 --> 40:42.586
The captain is in charge,
so how can we lose, huh?

40:44.978 --> 40:47.014
Hey, what are you doing here?

40:47.212 --> 40:50.521
- I'm sorry. The judge--
He's so unreasonable.
- Huh?

40:50.780 --> 40:52.598
I'm not on the case anymore.

40:52.781 --> 40:55.644
- But wait! What about Chen?
- Uh, I have to go.

40:55.881 --> 40:58.559
No, wait!
Hey, hey!

41:02.684 --> 41:06.059
Order! The Court is told...

41:06.318 --> 41:09.758
that the prosecution
will present four witnesses.

41:11.519 --> 41:13.816
Your Honor, that is correct.

41:14.020 --> 41:16.883
Each of them witnessed
the defendant commit the murder.

41:17.120 --> 41:20.213
And where did these
so-called witnesses come from?

41:20.455 --> 41:22.970
Defendant had a knife!
And he stabbed Master Akutagawa...

41:23.189 --> 41:26.597
-right through the heart,
and ran away before I could stop him.
- He was unreliable.

41:26.858 --> 41:28.828
- I recognize his face.
- Are you sure?

41:29.024 --> 41:31.353
It was him.
I'm certain.

41:31.558 --> 41:34.585
I recognized him clearly.

41:34.826 --> 41:38.081
- Tell me. How many fingers do you see?
- Um, nine?

41:39.394 --> 41:42.105
Uh, wait a minute. Six?

41:44.329 --> 41:48.510
- Um, you moved your hand.
Can you come closer?
- No.

41:48.797 --> 41:52.847
- This proves we're right.
These witnesses are lying.
- What a story!

41:56.365 --> 41:59.294
I was at Jing Wu
working with Biu Shin.

41:59.533 --> 42:01.732
Your Honor, Biu Shin's testimony...

42:01.934 --> 42:05.243
or that of any other Jing Wu students
cannot be trusted here.

42:05.502 --> 42:07.767
- Liar!

42:07.969 --> 42:10.353
Silence! Order!

42:10.570 --> 42:13.379
Sir, the witness
Has just arrived.

42:14.705 --> 42:18.145
Your Honor, I'd like
to call a witness now.

42:18.405 --> 42:22.619
- Your Honor, Chinese testimony
cannot be trusted.
- The witness is from Japan.

42:26.074 --> 42:29.776
- You should allow it.
- Mm, okay.

42:49.681 --> 42:52.610
Now, miss,
please identify yourself.

42:52.849 --> 42:54.950
My name is Mitsuko Yamada.

42:55.149 --> 42:58.720
I live in Kyoto, where my father
is Minister of Education.

42:58.984 --> 43:03.677
Miss Yamada, you heard the
suspect say he was atJing Wu
at the time of the murder.

43:03.985 --> 43:07.327
- Do you agree with that testimony?
- I do not agree.

43:10.687 --> 43:14.160
I was-- We went
to a hotel together.

43:14.422 --> 43:17.318
- We spent the night.
- You and Chen Zhen?

43:17.556 --> 43:19.146
Yes.

43:21.223 --> 43:23.008
What is she trying to say?

43:26.425 --> 43:29.713
Isn't it possible
that after you fell asleep...

43:29.960 --> 43:34.010
- Chen Zhen could've left?
- No, that's not possible.

43:34.294 --> 43:38.628
No. You see, we didn't ever actually
go to sleep that night.

43:38.929 --> 43:43.077
- Then what were you doing
if you weren't sleeping?
- We--

43:43.363 --> 43:47.250
Chen Zhen and I are in love.

43:49.765 --> 43:52.792
- Hey, what does she mean?
- Don't know. You?

43:53.033 --> 43:56.158
- She meant they were
fooling around together.
- Really?

43:56.401 --> 43:58.372
- With a Japanese girl?
- That's right.

44:03.236 --> 44:07.537
I find these proceedings ridiculous,
besides being a waste of my time.

44:07.837 --> 44:09.688
- Case dismissed.

44:11.005 --> 44:12.824
Congratulations.

44:13.006 --> 44:14.825
Let's go.

44:19.141 --> 44:22.646
Pathetic fools.
This isn't over yet.

44:31.011 --> 44:32.830
Why did you lie?

44:33.012 --> 44:37.281
I did it to save you.
Now we'll be together.

44:51.150 --> 44:53.894
Not from my kitchen!
She can starve for all I care!

44:57.019 --> 45:00.656
We sent you to Japan
to go to school, huh?

45:00.920 --> 45:04.459
Not to fall in love
with a Japanese woman.

45:04.721 --> 45:06.985
What do you suppose
the Master would say?

45:09.256 --> 45:11.075
Here at Jing Wu...

45:12.157 --> 45:15.826
we have been greatly dishonored
by the Japanese.

45:15.941 --> 45:17.759
Chen Zhen...

45:17.942 --> 45:20.010
you are part of Jing Wu.

45:20.209 --> 45:23.236
You must give up all ties
with the Japanese.

45:23.477 --> 45:26.569
Chen Zhen, tell me.
Have I ever once dishonored you?

45:26.812 --> 45:28.597
No, you haven't.

45:28.780 --> 45:33.310
Uh, Chen Zhen,
now that's a foolish mistake.

45:33.614 --> 45:37.120
Finish school,
and then find a wife.

45:37.381 --> 45:40.474
Better still,
find a Chinese wife.

45:40.716 --> 45:44.353
Don't you see? Mitsuko had to
give up everything for me.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.468
Her home and her family in Japan.

45:46.651 --> 45:49.264
- She even lied in court.
- Mmm.

45:49.485 --> 45:52.130
I've always heard that Japanese women
are born to lie.

45:55.154 --> 45:59.455
It's simple.
She's just not welcome here.

45:59.756 --> 46:01.606
Understand?

46:01.790 --> 46:05.427
She can leave by herself,
Or you both leave Jing Wu.

46:05.690 --> 46:08.945
But, Master,
why can't Mitsuko stay?

46:09.191 --> 46:12.000
What side are you on?
The Chinese or the Japanese?

46:12.225 --> 46:14.773
- That's not it.
- Now you're a traitor
to your own people.

46:14.993 --> 46:17.225
- You try saying that again.
- And what?

46:17.428 --> 46:19.529
- Wait! Chen!
- All right, that's enough!

46:22.796 --> 46:26.585
There's something
that we have to decide...

46:26.863 --> 46:29.988
or Jing Wu cannot go on.

46:30.230 --> 46:34.564
It would seem
you and I are in a battle...

46:34.865 --> 46:37.794
for the leadership position.

46:38.033 --> 46:41.093
- I don't know what you mean, Ting En.
- Don't play games.

46:41.335 --> 46:46.082
Listen, if you want to be in charge,
then fight me for it.

46:46.402 --> 46:50.137
I can be Master...
only by beating you.

46:52.204 --> 46:55.546
If you win, Jing Wu is yours.

48:22.398 --> 48:25.239
- Yeah!
- Hey, come on!

50:08.028 --> 50:10.869
Help get him up.

50:11.096 --> 50:13.643
Master, are you hurt?

50:14.621 --> 50:17.266
Is it finished?

50:17.489 --> 50:20.298
It's yours.

50:20.522 --> 50:22.341
- Take Jing Wu.
- No!

50:22.523 --> 50:27.118
I don't want Jing Wu,
but I won't leave Mitsuko.

50:27.424 --> 50:30.679
If we have to leave together...

50:30.926 --> 50:32.744
then I guess it's good-bye.

51:03.368 --> 51:05.273
- Chen told me. It's a real mess.
- Uh-huh.

51:05.469 --> 51:07.287
Boy!

51:11.636 --> 51:14.499
- Wait here. I'll get us a room.
- All right.

51:17.438 --> 51:19.322
Sir, any rooms?

51:19.505 --> 51:22.794
- Sure. Right this way, sir.
- Okay.

51:23.040 --> 51:26.382
- Let's go.

51:26.641 --> 51:31.387
Oh, she's Japanese.
Please, not in my hotel.

51:31.709 --> 51:33.809
We're together.
You understand.

51:34.009 --> 51:35.947
- Look at them.
- That's Chen Zhen!

51:36.146 --> 51:39.434
- He's a traitor.
- Look, I'm sorry.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.293
- You don't belong here!
- Go back to Japan!

51:42.514 --> 51:46.085
- Get out of here.
- Go away before any of you gets hurt.

51:46.348 --> 51:49.059
- Come on. Let's go.
- Getouttahere!

51:49.282 --> 51:51.416
Traitor! Japanese!

52:14.856 --> 52:16.674
- A mouse?
- What's the matter?

52:16.857 --> 52:18.860
In there. I saw it!

52:19.057 --> 52:21.028
Really?

52:24.425 --> 52:27.071
- Where?
- I don't know. I saw it over there.

52:27.292 --> 52:30.253
- Ahh!
- I don't see it.

52:36.195 --> 52:38.231
You probably scared it away.

52:39.996 --> 52:42.989
Oh! I know it's silly.

52:43.231 --> 52:46.900
- But I'm the one who's scared.
- In Kyoto, aren't there
any mice or rats?

52:47.165 --> 52:50.028
Mm-hmm. But I was afraid of them.

52:52.166 --> 52:56.630
I'm sorry. I thought you'd
really like it living here.

52:56.933 --> 52:59.416
I'm sure I can get used to it.

52:59.635 --> 53:03.653
Oh, we have a great view!
Much nicer than a hotel.

53:03.936 --> 53:07.126
It's beautiful here.
I know you'll be very happy.

53:07.371 --> 53:09.732
And what about you?

53:11.339 --> 53:13.374
Jing Wu was my family.

53:13.572 --> 53:16.217
Without them,
it's almost like starting over.

53:16.439 --> 53:20.044
- Do you think you can?
- Why not?

53:20.307 --> 53:23.944
Jing Wu is your family, and you
can't live without your family.

53:24.208 --> 53:26.440
You know you can't.

53:28.176 --> 53:31.333
I think I know you
a little better than you do.

53:34.378 --> 53:37.306
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.981
- Here's your tea.
- Hmm.

53:53.183 --> 53:55.284
Hey, have you eaten?

53:55.483 --> 53:58.227
Not since breakfast.

53:58.452 --> 54:01.544
Heard from Ting En?

54:03.151 --> 54:05.002
Ah, I knew it.

54:05.186 --> 54:09.911
It was hard for him to lose, especially
to Chen Zhen. They were really close.

54:10.220 --> 54:14.074
Ting En's pride is still hurting.
I'm afraid we'll lose him.

54:14.356 --> 54:16.968
Then what are we
supposed to do?

54:17.190 --> 54:19.640
Forget about our school's future
and our good name?

54:21.390 --> 54:24.547
Suppose someone challenges us.

54:24.791 --> 54:28.264
- Hey, who else can teach?
- Cheung and Biu.

54:31.393 --> 54:34.997
Were we to receive a challenge,
we're in trouble.

54:36.713 --> 54:38.782
My mother wrote to me.

54:38.981 --> 54:42.236
She said Jing Wu
Angered Japan.

54:42.481 --> 54:44.865
She told me to come home.

54:45.083 --> 54:49.481
- If there's trouble,
you'll be safe here.
- It still worries me.

54:49.783 --> 54:52.200
Don't worry.
We watch out for our people.

54:52.417 --> 54:54.453
We protect them all, everyone.

55:02.754 --> 55:04.604
You Chinese are wasteful.

55:04.787 --> 55:07.084
So few of you,
and all this food!

55:07.289 --> 55:09.520
What's this?

55:09.723 --> 55:13.773
We're here with a proposal
for the Jing Wu Master.

55:14.056 --> 55:16.572
He shouldn't be bothered.
Let me look at it.

55:16.791 --> 55:21.669
The great Funakoshi, a Sensai...

55:21.993 --> 55:24.802
issues a challenge
to Jing Wu.

55:37.030 --> 55:39.708
-  What do we do?
- We should find Master!

55:39.931 --> 55:43.240
- For this fight,
we need Chen Zhen, not Master!
- He's gone over to the enemy.

55:43.498 --> 55:45.915
- You'd better watch what you're saying!
- Or what?

55:46.132 --> 55:49.224
That's enough of this foolishness.
Go and fight somewhere else.

55:49.467 --> 55:52.526
Get out there and find Ting En.
Go! You help him.

55:59.303 --> 56:01.338
- Uncle?
- Uncle?

56:04.237 --> 56:06.056
Cheung.

56:07.472 --> 56:11.109
- He doesn't want us to find him.
- That's for sure.

56:14.207 --> 56:16.025
So what's going on?

56:16.207 --> 56:20.671
- What's going on? Where's the money?
- Shh.

56:23.776 --> 56:26.073
Try to show some patience,
all right?

56:26.276 --> 56:29.881
- If I wait much longer,
they'll discover me.
- No, they won't.

56:30.144 --> 56:32.855
The Japanese can keep a secret.
How will anyone know?

56:33.078 --> 56:37.890
- Because it's traceable.
- No, it's not traceable.
Not to you or me.

56:38.213 --> 56:39.672
It isn't right.

56:39.848 --> 56:42.363
I did give the drug
to Master Hou, didn't I?

56:42.581 --> 56:45.031
You did your job,
so don't worry!

56:45.249 --> 56:48.722
You'll get your money.
And you know what's better?

56:48.983 --> 56:52.423
When the Japanese take over,
then we'll be set.

56:52.684 --> 56:56.092
Then there'll be lots of money.
Do you understand?

57:01.286 --> 57:04.476
I wish I had known.

57:04.720 --> 57:08.487
You should've told me
that Thorazide was poisonous!

57:08.756 --> 57:10.955
I never would've
Given it to him.

57:16.690 --> 57:20.098
[Woman Screams]
Help! Help!

57:21.692 --> 57:23.510
It's the cook!

57:23.692 --> 57:25.510
Someone help me
get him down!

57:27.760 --> 57:31.070
Lift him off the rope! Now!

57:31.328 --> 57:34.550
Come on.
Let's move it along.

57:41.164 --> 57:44.898
- We found traces of Thorazide on this.
- Really?

57:45.166 --> 57:47.648
That's the bark
Of a ginkgo tree.

57:47.867 --> 57:51.569
- It's used for asthma.
- What did he say we do with it?

57:51.834 --> 57:55.503
Wait, the Master had asthma.
And the cook used to treat it.

57:55.770 --> 57:57.588
- Oh, he did?
- Uh-huh.

57:57.770 --> 58:01.722
That means the cook's the one
who gave him the poison.

58:02.003 --> 58:04.932
That's very interesting.

58:05.508 --> 58:08.849
Hey, listen, Captain.
Let's keep this quiet, okay?

58:09.110 --> 58:11.886
Makes no difference.
He's dead anyway.

58:12.111 --> 58:14.887
We can't keep a murder a secret!

58:15.111 --> 58:18.170
For all we know,
there may be others involved.

58:18.411 --> 58:22.526
We're really gonna have
to investigate to find out for sure.

58:22.812 --> 58:24.978
An investigation.

58:25.178 --> 58:27.475
The school will never survive
this scandal.

58:27.680 --> 58:29.682
Ask him.

58:31.113 --> 58:33.857
Captain, so now what?

58:34.079 --> 58:35.963
Go investigate some more.

58:36.147 --> 58:38.858
How 'bout these?
What now?

58:39.081 --> 58:41.345
Get an analysis done
right away.

58:41.547 --> 58:45.433
Captain, could you help me
look for Ting En now?

58:45.715 --> 58:48.076
Don't worry.
I'll find him.

59:10.285 --> 59:12.549
Excuse me.
Are you looking for someone?

59:12.753 --> 59:15.845
I wonder if I could
please talk to Mr. Nang?

59:16.086 --> 59:19.276
- He's right here. Follow me.
- Mmm.

59:23.421 --> 59:25.750
Uncle, this lady's here
to see you.

59:25.955 --> 59:28.763
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

59:28.988 --> 59:33.168
I know that you and the whole police
force have been looking for Ting En.

59:33.455 --> 59:35.937
Do you know
where I might find him?

59:37.856 --> 59:42.189
- Uh, the Star House.
- A whorehouse?

59:42.490 --> 59:45.615
- Mmm.

01:00:00.358 --> 01:00:02.688
Is he staying with you?

01:00:04.092 --> 01:00:05.910
He is.

01:00:11.327 --> 01:00:14.223
How long have you been seeing him?

01:00:15.894 --> 01:00:18.376
About a year,
maybe longer.

01:00:19.862 --> 01:00:24.456
For the first few months,
he seemed to be happy.

01:00:24.763 --> 01:00:28.464
Now he fights all the time.
He talks about Jing Wu.

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:31.984
About how he misses his home.

01:00:32.231 --> 01:00:35.964
I think--
Won't you try and take him home?

01:00:55.801 --> 01:00:57.042
Ting En!

01:01:00.034 --> 01:01:02.745
Let me go! No!

01:01:02.969 --> 01:01:05.995
I'm gonna kill 'em! I wanna fight!

01:01:06.236 --> 01:01:08.783
Let me go, you--

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.583
Here, drink some tea.

01:01:16.536 --> 01:01:19.791
Mmm.

01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:29.533
Let's go.

01:01:29.739 --> 01:01:31.589
You're here.

01:01:31.773 --> 01:01:34.734
There must be a reason.

01:01:34.973 --> 01:01:37.204
The Niguchi Clan
came to see us.

01:01:37.407 --> 01:01:39.857
They've challenged you.

01:01:41.074 --> 01:01:43.076
What about Chen?

01:01:43.274 --> 01:01:47.704
You are the Master of Jing Wu.
You represent us.

01:01:49.941 --> 01:01:52.717
You try talking to him.

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:55.358
When is it?

01:01:57.609 --> 01:01:59.514
I'll fight.

01:02:02.743 --> 01:02:05.519
You'll come back?

01:02:05.743 --> 01:02:07.430
Of course.

01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:10.800
My home will always be Jing Wu.

01:02:13.278 --> 01:02:15.477
Hey, Ting En.

01:02:18.179 --> 01:02:20.117
What about Miss Shien?

01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:25.225
You're going to leave her
after all she's done?

01:02:25.446 --> 01:02:27.613
You buy her out.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.156
- Get the Madam.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:34.895
We'll pay.

01:02:38.248 --> 01:02:41.590
I guess you won't be wearing
all those fancy dresses anymore.

01:02:41.849 --> 01:02:44.657
No, but I really
won't miss them.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.145
That one fits you well,
and it looks so good on you.

01:02:50.383 --> 01:02:55.521
I've investigated. Funakoshi
is the best warrior of his clan,
in fact, in all of Japan.

01:02:55.851 --> 01:02:57.669
But don't you worry.
He's getting old now.

01:02:57.851 --> 01:03:00.714
- Uncle Nang.
- Uncle Nang!

01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:04.173
Hey, she looks good.

01:03:07.886 --> 01:03:11.227
Hey, listen, I think you'll fit in
Really well here.

01:03:11.486 --> 01:03:12.977
Thank you.

01:03:13.153 --> 01:03:16.855
You could be as kind
to Mitsuko.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.417
That's different.
Mitsuko is Japanese.

01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:23.061
Ting En, the challenge
is on for tomorrow. Practice.

01:03:23.321 --> 01:03:26.064
Mm-hmm.

01:03:34.856 --> 01:03:37.403
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

01:03:37.624 --> 01:03:39.529
- You, come on.
- Okay.

01:03:39.724 --> 01:03:41.575
- Let's go. Drink later.
- Thankyou.

01:03:41.757 --> 01:03:43.641
Come on.

01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:48.188
He looks strong.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:50.558
The challenge is tomorrow.

01:03:50.758 --> 01:03:52.761
Ting En against
the Niguchi Master.

01:03:55.026 --> 01:03:58.596
Then he must be the best
At Jing Wu now.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.927
He is.

01:04:01.127 --> 01:04:03.543
Better than Chen?

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.233
It's not important.
They're both good.

01:04:14.028 --> 01:04:16.260
- Master, I'm sorry.
- Are you hurt?

01:04:16.462 --> 01:04:19.423
I'm fine.
Hey, I'm okay.

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:26.600
- What's wrong? He isn't the same.
- Hmm.

01:05:06.805 --> 01:05:09.581
Funakoshi,
you will fight Ting En tomorrow.

01:05:16.772 --> 01:05:19.036
Fujita...

01:05:19.238 --> 01:05:24.855
don't even dare try to tell me...
who I will challenge.

01:05:25.207 --> 01:05:28.364
So it's Chen Zhen.
Then let me tell you something.

01:05:28.606 --> 01:05:32.210
I know all about him...
and your niece.

01:05:34.575 --> 01:05:38.907
So? Mitsuko is in no way
any of your concern.

01:05:39.209 --> 01:05:41.570
I'll make her my concern
If she's your weakness.

01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:44.486
Hmph.

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:49.967
Whatever weakness is that the General
is perceiving would have to be his own.

01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:53.086
I have none.

01:06:11.547 --> 01:06:13.452
You're up early today.

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:16.176
Good morning.

01:06:23.836 --> 01:06:27.057
Oh, look,
isn't that Uncle?

01:06:27.302 --> 01:06:29.533
- It is you!
- Oh, Mitsuko!

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:32.630
If I'd known you live so far from town,
I'd have hired a carriage.

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:37.079
- Did my father send you?
- No. In fact,
he doesn't even know I'm here.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:39.783
Then why'd you come
all this way?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.114
- To see him.
- Chen Zhen?

01:06:44.399 --> 01:06:48.186
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

01:06:48.466 --> 01:06:51.077
- Do you want to be?
- I think so...

01:06:51.298 --> 01:06:54.291
if the Chinese and Japanese
ever stop fighting.

01:06:54.531 --> 01:06:56.859
It's good you're not married.

01:06:57.065 --> 01:07:00.830
You're much too young...
to become a widow.

01:07:01.097 --> 01:07:02.914
What's that?

01:07:03.097 --> 01:07:07.210
And if you should die,
I'll send your ashes back to Japan.

01:07:07.496 --> 01:07:10.456
You sound very confident.

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:15.505
Why didn't you tell me
you're gonna fight my uncle?

01:07:15.728 --> 01:07:18.754
Well, he didn't want
to worry you.

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.225
Chen Zhen, come.

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:34.638
So anxious. Why don't you
show me what you've learned?

01:07:42.956 --> 01:07:46.395
It's about the energy. About focusing
on a single point in time.

01:07:46.656 --> 01:07:49.648
So, it's about energy.

01:07:49.889 --> 01:07:54.482
But tell me something. Does a rock have
as much energy as an opponent would?

01:07:54.788 --> 01:07:57.814
You need a more powerful stroke
When you're fighting a human being.

01:07:59.554 --> 01:08:01.720
Let's see how I can put it
into action.

01:08:01.921 --> 01:08:05.327
Hmph. What else
has Master Hou taught you?

01:08:05.586 --> 01:08:08.481
Simple.
Observe your opponent.

01:08:08.719 --> 01:08:11.527
Attack him.
Learn to exploit his weakness.

01:08:11.751 --> 01:08:16.082
Ah! Sounds to me like
you've been learning karate...

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:18.354
becoming samurai.

01:08:18.551 --> 01:08:22.731
Not from Master Hou.
He taught us the art of kung fu.

01:08:23.017 --> 01:08:28.154
Just because the principles are similar,
does it mean we learn karate?

01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:30.386
Hmm.

01:08:30.582 --> 01:08:35.392
So tell me what lessons you've learned
about controlling one's anger.

01:08:35.715 --> 01:08:38.076
Don't tell me your Master
forgot that one?

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:41.687
You didn't come here to talk.
It's time.

01:08:41.947 --> 01:08:44.274
Hmm.

01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:51.879
Wait!

01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:19.258
Hold it!

01:09:19.474 --> 01:09:21.509
I need to warm up.

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:37.399
Huh?
What style is that?

01:10:37.597 --> 01:10:39.697
Don't worry.
I'll show it to you.

01:10:39.896 --> 01:10:41.713
Oh!

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:05.263
- Can you see?
- I'll manage.

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:07.302
We'll make it even.

01:14:37.559 --> 01:14:39.790
The battle's done.

01:14:42.692 --> 01:14:45.238
Are you all right?

01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:49.725
I'm surprised. You're still
So young... yet so skillful.

01:14:51.157 --> 01:14:53.518
Your talent...
is astonishing.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:56.531
In Japan,
there is a proverb...

01:14:56.757 --> 01:14:59.564
that says experience should fear
the strength of youth.

01:15:03.822 --> 01:15:05.704
But you won!

01:15:05.888 --> 01:15:08.946
Sure, because I
adapted to you.

01:15:09.188 --> 01:15:11.222
With your ability...

01:15:11.421 --> 01:15:16.623
if you learn to be fluid, to adapt,
you'll always be unbeatable.

01:15:16.953 --> 01:15:20.261
It seems I have
a lot to learn about fighting.

01:15:20.518 --> 01:15:22.401
You're not alone.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:24.719
But try to understand.

01:15:24.918 --> 01:15:26.985
When you learn how to adapt...

01:15:27.185 --> 01:15:29.122
you'll be unstoppable.

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:32.027
See, Chen Zhen?

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:35.340
When you redirect
your opponent's energy...

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.259
you force him to change.

01:15:38.483 --> 01:15:41.094
So, in essence,
he defeats himself.

01:15:41.316 --> 01:15:43.644
See? That's it.

01:15:45.382 --> 01:15:48.538
Are you going back to Japan?

01:15:48.781 --> 01:15:51.969
Chen Zhen, our fight is over.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.119
Yes.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.483
However, there is another
Japanese Master...

01:15:59.746 --> 01:16:02.129
who is known as
the ''Supreme Killer.''

01:16:02.346 --> 01:16:05.437
Chen Zhen told me
you were the best ofall the clans.

01:16:05.678 --> 01:16:09.314
He is a man of dignity
and a samurai warrior...

01:16:09.578 --> 01:16:11.874
but that does not
make him a killer.

01:16:12.077 --> 01:16:13.634
Hmm.

01:16:13.811 --> 01:16:18.687
Now your Master would surely
be proud of his disciple.

01:16:22.742 --> 01:16:25.833
The most powerful fighter
at the Niguchi Arena...

01:16:26.075 --> 01:16:29.579
is a man called
General Fujita.

01:16:29.842 --> 01:16:31.811
Take care when you fight him.

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:52.601
Oh, white wins out.

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:59.691
Your skill has improved
a lot since the last time.

01:16:59.936 --> 01:17:02.135
Thankyou.

01:17:02.336 --> 01:17:06.287
You know, I think
General Fujita has become...

01:17:06.568 --> 01:17:10.137
obsessed with conquering
all of Jing Wu Mun...

01:17:10.401 --> 01:17:13.077
and eventually Shanghai.

01:17:13.301 --> 01:17:15.750
It's become important to him...

01:17:15.968 --> 01:17:19.091
as the first step of...

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:22.109
conquering all of China.

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:24.629
I-Is he serious?

01:17:27.132 --> 01:17:29.265
That's impossible.
He must be crazy.

01:17:29.466 --> 01:17:31.664
I tell you,
that's what he's doing!

01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:35.368
If you observe
his troop movements...

01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:37.927
his plan becomes obvious.

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:40.067
There's just no way.

01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:43.039
Japan is like an insect
whose objective...

01:17:43.263 --> 01:17:46.103
is to destroy an elephant.

01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:50.378
While the elephant is asleep,
The insect has the advantage.

01:17:50.663 --> 01:17:54.907
But as soon
as the elephant wakes...

01:17:55.195 --> 01:17:59.047
it has the strength
to eliminate the insect!

01:17:59.328 --> 01:18:01.711
And, yet again...

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:05.943
if the military
can take control of Shanghai...

01:18:06.227 --> 01:18:08.937
it will weaken the elephant
in a big way.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.195
But it is still impossible!

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:21.531
Okay. Let's say the parable
is about a venomous insect...

01:18:21.858 --> 01:18:25.014
and it can strike
the elephant's heart.

01:18:25.257 --> 01:18:28.761
Before it wakes up,
it's already paralyzed.

01:18:29.023 --> 01:18:32.082
Japan has such insects.

01:18:32.323 --> 01:18:34.870
Just look at General Fujita.

01:18:36.322 --> 01:18:38.836
There are far too manylike him.

01:18:39.056 --> 01:18:43.616
If that's true,
then a war will be unavoidable.

01:19:08.717 --> 01:19:10.915
- You're back!

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:15.667
Hello.

01:19:15.849 --> 01:19:18.624
Chen Zhen?

01:19:18.848 --> 01:19:21.427
He'll be back.

01:19:21.648 --> 01:19:24.031
Ah...

01:19:24.248 --> 01:19:26.382
please, have a seat.

01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:46.294
Some tea?

01:19:46.511 --> 01:19:48.295
Thanks.

01:19:54.343 --> 01:19:56.193
Are you happy here?

01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:58.672
Mm-hmm.
We are.

01:20:00.176 --> 01:20:02.026
That's good.

01:20:06.574 --> 01:20:11.003
Oh, Chen Zhen!
Look, it's Ting En.

01:20:26.438 --> 01:20:29.148
Still practicing,
quite a bit?

01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:31.373
Whenever I can, of course.

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.387
And Jing Wu?

01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:38.315
What about it?
I miss it, but...

01:20:38.636 --> 01:20:40.997
as you can see
I have a new life.

01:20:42.202 --> 01:20:44.172
But we need you there.

01:20:52.234 --> 01:20:54.683
Shien Han, she has moved in.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:58.241
- From the brothel?
- Mm-hmm. It's working out.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.089
Good!

01:21:00.265 --> 01:21:03.008
You could bring Mitsuko too.

01:21:06.065 --> 01:21:09.984
They'll accept Shien Han,
but not Mitsuko.

01:21:10.264 --> 01:21:12.908
It's really too bad.

01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:16.156
She means a lot to you.
She is a good woman.

01:21:18.096 --> 01:21:20.958
Not everyone believes that.
If I were to bring her there...

01:21:21.195 --> 01:21:23.045
it would cause
too much trouble.

01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:25.808
- I can't be that selfish.
- It's your decision.

01:21:26.029 --> 01:21:28.772
I learned a new style.

01:21:28.994 --> 01:21:31.061
- What is it?
- I'll show you!

01:22:09.771 --> 01:22:11.737
This is the same
as the Hou style.

01:22:11.934 --> 01:22:14.887
Yes. The Hou Fist Method.

01:22:15.127 --> 01:22:17.635
I remember.
But it's only for the Hou Clan.

01:22:17.854 --> 01:22:20.775
That was true,
but now things are different.

01:22:21.015 --> 01:22:23.110
The whole school
has to learn it.

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.503
Chen Zhen, listen.

01:22:25.705 --> 01:22:28.822
Tomorrow I fight at Niguchi.
If anything happens...

01:22:29.064 --> 01:22:31.985
teach this style
to the others.

01:22:54.253 --> 01:22:56.099
My dear Chen Zhen...

01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:58.790
I have decided
to return home.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:02.984
I understand why this fight
is important to you and your country...

01:23:03.266 --> 01:23:05.872
and I think my being with you
is hurting your cause.

01:23:06.093 --> 01:23:08.222
Fulfiill your promise.

01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:10.832
And when the soldiers
return to Japan...

01:23:11.049 --> 01:23:14.350
I will be waiting for you
in Kyoto. ''

01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:10.816
Lun will come with me.

01:24:11.013 --> 01:24:15.564
Ting En, I'm worried. Maybe you
should have more men with you.

01:24:15.868 --> 01:24:17.682
There's nothing
to worry about.

01:24:17.864 --> 01:24:20.437
They know the rules.
Only two men can fight.

01:24:20.658 --> 01:24:23.492
Yes. That's right.

01:24:24.751 --> 01:24:28.052
Xiao Wei,
take care of her... please.

01:24:28.311 --> 01:24:30.125
Mm-hmm.

01:24:33.765 --> 01:24:36.175
Wait. Ting En.

01:24:39.486 --> 01:24:41.712
I'll go with you
If you want.

01:24:42.546 --> 01:24:44.360
Mmm.

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.096
Let's go.

01:24:49.298 --> 01:24:51.426
Good!

01:24:51.627 --> 01:24:54.396
How about those two?
Together again!

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:58.627
Sensai Funakoshi left Shanghai
early this morning.

01:24:58.911 --> 01:25:00.844
He's a stubborn old fool.

01:25:01.039 --> 01:25:03.298
With or without him,
the fight goes on.

01:25:03.501 --> 01:25:06.238
I will deal with him
another time.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.904
Yes.

01:25:09.121 --> 01:25:12.879
General, then we are still
going to fight Jing Wu Mun?

01:25:13.146 --> 01:25:16.926
Yes. We can't rely
on Funakoshi for everything.

01:25:17.204 --> 01:25:20.060
I'm going to personally
handle this matter.

01:25:40.852 --> 01:25:43.621
So you've accepted.
That's good.

01:25:45.176 --> 01:25:48.162
First, though, I have something
you should see.

01:25:48.402 --> 01:25:50.183
I have Master Hou's murderer.

01:25:54.622 --> 01:25:57.326
Come here!

01:26:05.565 --> 01:26:07.694
Mr. Cheung accepted a bribe.

01:26:07.892 --> 01:26:11.389
He and the cook soaked
the bark of the gingko... in poison.

01:26:24.656 --> 01:26:28.153
It's over.
Take him away.

01:26:31.509 --> 01:26:34.626
- Move your men out. Move them out.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:34.868 --> 01:26:36.682
All right, everyone out.

01:26:44.624 --> 01:26:45.667
It reads ''Jing Wu is closed.''...

01:26:45.668 --> 01:26:48.034
You may open the gates back and destroy the sign...

01:26:48.035 --> 01:26:48.950
if you can defeat me.

01:27:50.532 --> 01:27:52.726
Here, catch this!

01:35:24.582 --> 01:35:27.471
- Can you walk? Come on.
- Yeah.

01:36:50.458 --> 01:36:53.195
Halt! General?

01:37:01.228 --> 01:37:04.312
Ambassador, the General, he's dead.

01:37:09.344 --> 01:37:13.416
Come on! Police!
Don't move or I'll shoot!

01:37:13.702 --> 01:37:16.308
- We okay here?
- Are you all right?

01:37:16.528 --> 01:37:20.188
Freeze! You are all
in the Japanese compound.

01:37:20.453 --> 01:37:22.483
You have no authority here.

01:37:23.481 --> 01:37:27.772
Soldier, these weapons
are all the authority we need.

01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:30.082
These men are Chinese,
and they're in our custody.

01:37:30.283 --> 01:37:33.433
What? I order you
to turn them over!

01:37:33.677 --> 01:37:36.762
- Don't move! Freeze!
- Hold it!

01:37:37.002 --> 01:37:39.000
Now we'll see who gives
the orders in my country.

01:37:40.428 --> 01:37:42.242
Stop it!

01:37:43.921 --> 01:37:46.843
Everyone, hold your fire!

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:52.206
Now then, this argument
will be solved in a peaceful manner.

01:37:52.536 --> 01:37:54.414
The General is dead.

01:37:54.597 --> 01:37:57.877
But there will be
no more lost lives!

01:37:58.123 --> 01:37:59.937
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

01:38:00.119 --> 01:38:01.965
Remove your platoon!

01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:04.472
But, sir!

01:38:04.675 --> 01:38:07.727
I'm the one that's in charge now.
Understand?

01:38:07.969 --> 01:38:10.478
You will all do
as you're ordered!

01:38:10.696 --> 01:38:13.781
Yes, sir.
Company, move out.

01:38:24.034 --> 01:38:28.747
Captain,
A Japanese general is dead.

01:38:29.055 --> 01:38:31.466
I must know who killed him.

01:38:31.683 --> 01:38:35.527
Someone will be held responsible.

01:38:35.808 --> 01:38:37.709
Otherwise the military
won't let it go.

01:38:37.903 --> 01:38:42.834
You need a scapegoat
to prevent our countries going to war.

01:38:43.158 --> 01:38:45.091
Mmm.

01:38:49.444 --> 01:38:52.941
All right.
I'm going to be that man.

01:38:53.203 --> 01:38:55.331
No! He can't do that.

01:38:59.256 --> 01:39:03.547
China will be in your debt.

01:39:11.452 --> 01:39:14.406
Let us in! Let us in!

01:39:14.645 --> 01:39:16.491
Open up!

01:39:17.605 --> 01:39:20.939
Tell us what's happened.

01:39:29.179 --> 01:39:30.993
Tell us!

01:39:34.867 --> 01:39:36.681
Who is it?

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:39.858
What's going on?

01:39:50.365 --> 01:39:53.617
What did I tell you?
I knew the Japanese forces would--

01:39:53.868 --> 01:39:56.506
Lives were lost this time.
It's terrible.

01:39:56.724 --> 01:40:00.697
You know the Japanese soldiers
are responsible for this.

01:40:00.975 --> 01:40:03.761
I knew there'd be killing.
I tried to tell. No one listens to me.

01:40:03.991 --> 01:40:08.060
Chen Zhen, he was the real hero.
Let me tell you.

01:40:08.339 --> 01:40:11.559
He took on the Niguchi warriors,
and he beat them all!

01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:14.226
I know.
I saw it myself.

01:40:14.438 --> 01:40:17.077
Ahh. Then the soldiers shot him.

01:40:21.121 --> 01:40:23.292
What's wrong?
Who is it?

01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:25.598
No one, no one.
Go on.

01:40:31.244 --> 01:40:34.962
I can't believe you have to leave
Shanghai and start all over.

01:40:35.234 --> 01:40:39.144
- Are you going to be with Mitsuko?
- Mm-hmm.

01:40:41.161 --> 01:40:43.766
If I no longer have a country...

01:40:43.983 --> 01:40:46.928
at least I can be
with the woman I love.
