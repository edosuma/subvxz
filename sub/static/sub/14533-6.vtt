00:12.250 --> 00:13.792
LEE RUSSELL: This woman
will fire you and me.

00:13.792 --> 00:16.083
-Now is the time to strike.
-GAMBY: I need a favor from you.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.083
I need the secret file
you've got on Amanda Snodgrass.

00:18.083 --> 00:19.709
You're trying
to get your little dick wet.

00:19.709 --> 00:20.959
-Nope.
-Like a little red dog.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.375
Don't talk about my red thing.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.583
I'm chaperoning Bill Hayden's
history field trip.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.417
GAMBY: Guess who's going
on a little trip

00:27.417 --> 00:28.750
with a lady friend?

00:28.917 --> 00:30.583
RAY LIPTRAPP: It must tough
wrangling all 'em kids.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.041
I don't know how you do it, man.

00:32.041 --> 00:34.208
I bet if I told you I just stole
a man's wife and family,

00:34.208 --> 00:35.750
you'd understand how to do that.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.917
Janelle's not really
that into horses anymore.

00:37.917 --> 00:41.083
I want to start doing motocross.
Ray thinks I'll be good at it.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.625
GAMBY: I just keep
getting beat down

00:42.625 --> 00:44.250
and the whole entire school
is crumbling.

00:51.125 --> 00:53.125
♪ ♪

00:59.333 --> 01:00.834
(whistles)

01:06.375 --> 01:08.917
Hey, babe,
check this out.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.625
Mm. Whoa.
Uh-huh.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.125
I told you it would show.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.375
It's like a dog bite.
(both chuckle)

01:13.375 --> 01:15.792
Guess I'll be wearing
a lot of scarves this week.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.125
Yeah, I got a little crazy.

01:17.125 --> 01:19.500
Yes, you did.
So here's something.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.625
Um...

01:20.625 --> 01:24.166
What do you think
about pressing pause
for a while?

01:24.166 --> 01:25.166
On what?

01:25.166 --> 01:27.083
This whole thing.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.625
Last six weeks,
you had planning seventh period,

01:29.625 --> 01:31.166
so it was easy
for us to sneak around

01:31.166 --> 01:33.709
it was fun,
but now you've got
a class seventh,

01:33.709 --> 01:35.333
we don't get to hang
till after work,

01:35.333 --> 01:37.333
and then it all
has to be arranged.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.875
I liked it better
when it was more...

01:39.875 --> 01:41.542
spontaneous.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.000
Wha--

01:43.000 --> 01:44.083
No.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.417
We're done because
I have to work seventh period,

01:46.417 --> 01:47.667
and you don't?
I mean...

01:47.667 --> 01:48.917
kind of.

01:48.917 --> 01:51.166
Surely it has to be something
more than seventh period.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.500
I'm not complicated, kid.
That's it.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.709
Okay, yeah.

01:54.709 --> 01:55.625
Sure.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.166
Whatever.
That's, yeah, awesome.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.291
So, you're okay?
You're not hurt?
Hurt?

01:59.291 --> 02:01.125
Not me. Mm-mm.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.792
You are such a cool kid.
Yeah.

02:02.792 --> 02:04.625
Uh, we should
get to school though.
Mm-hmm.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.875
Um, do you want
to peace out first

02:05.875 --> 02:07.250
and then I'll head out
in like five?

02:07.250 --> 02:08.709
You got it.
Great.

02:08.709 --> 02:11.208
Okay.
All right. Feel free
to finish your cereal and stuff.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.041
Okay.
There's juice in the fridge.

02:13.041 --> 02:14.709
I'm good.
Thank you.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.041
(theme music playing)

02:34.667 --> 02:37.750
Well, I have some
very, very bad news,
Dr. Brown.

02:37.750 --> 02:42.375
We lost track of over 600
brand-new textbooks.

02:42.375 --> 02:45.875
Paid for and then vanished.

02:45.875 --> 02:50.208
Now, how does one lose
600 textbooks?

02:50.208 --> 02:51.500
Are we sure
they were delivered?

02:51.500 --> 02:52.750
Oh yeah.
Got the slip right here.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.125
Signed for by Ms. LeBlanc.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.208
Ms. LeBlanc?

02:55.208 --> 02:57.083
The head of
the English department?
Mm.

02:57.083 --> 03:00.000
I call her Ms. LeBitch.
I do not like her.
And is there anybody

03:00.000 --> 03:02.959
at the school
you do like, Mr. Gamby?
Russell: Well actually for once,

03:02.959 --> 03:05.208
Gamby's right.
Veteran school teacher,

03:05.208 --> 03:07.417
zero respect
for administrators.

03:07.417 --> 03:08.709
Thinks she runs
the damn school.

03:08.709 --> 03:10.750
Sound like someone
need a smack-down.

03:10.750 --> 03:11.959
So what's the problem?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.166
Welles was scared of her.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.917
Let her do
whatever she wanted.

03:14.917 --> 03:17.417
His fear created a monster.
Well, now, it's not
all Welles' fault.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.875
I mean, she was pretty much
a bitch when she got here.

03:19.875 --> 03:21.083
She's got deep union ties,

03:21.083 --> 03:23.125
Mm-hmm.
well liked by the students
and faculty.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.583
He just didn't like
tussling with her.
He knew it was a losing battle.

03:25.583 --> 03:28.750
Some books she signed for
went missing like this
two years ago.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.667
Yeah.
Welles just swept it
under the rug.

03:30.667 --> 03:31.667
My theory,

03:31.667 --> 03:33.291
she's ordering more
than she needs

03:33.291 --> 03:34.458
and selling them
to a third party.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.000
Probably figuring
no one's checking

03:36.000 --> 03:38.125
'cause it's all backed
by tax dollars anyway.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.625
Everybody thinks it's free
when Uncle Sugar is
footing the bill.

03:40.625 --> 03:42.834
Stealing books from children?

03:42.834 --> 03:44.500
Books!
Books!

03:44.500 --> 03:46.834
The foundation of learning!

03:46.834 --> 03:48.166
Now, that's some low shit.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.417
Low shit.
That's some...

03:49.417 --> 03:51.750
dirty, dirty shit for sure.

03:51.750 --> 03:55.750
Anyway, if you decide
to move on this,
do it delicately.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.667
LeBlanc is a force
to be reckoned with.

03:57.667 --> 04:00.792
Mm-hmm.
So am I, Mr. Russell.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.458
So am I.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.291
(school bell chimes)

04:06.291 --> 04:08.125
Hayden:
Keep it to one side, please,

04:08.125 --> 04:09.625
or go to class.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.667
Snodgrass:
Hey!

04:10.667 --> 04:12.750
A History teacher
in the English hallway.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.000
Somebody lost?
You wish, kid.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.458
No, I'm trying to find my TA.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.458
I think she's lost.
You have a TA?

04:18.458 --> 04:19.458
Billy!

04:19.458 --> 04:22.125
Oh, I was surrounded
by freshmen.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.792
Thank God. Save me.
Ugh. Ugh.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.333
(both chuckle)
Uh, Carrie, this is

04:25.333 --> 04:27.333
Amanda Snodgrass.
She teaches English here.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.500
Howdy. Hey.
Hey!

04:28.500 --> 04:30.333
I'm, um, just
finishing up my degree.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.917
Just gotta knock out
this TA thing.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.250
Luckily, they put
me with, uh...

04:33.250 --> 04:35.333
Bill-Bill!
(laughs)

04:35.333 --> 04:37.417
Ha! Bill-Bill!

04:37.417 --> 04:38.875
Awesome.

04:38.875 --> 04:39.917
Yeah.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.333
Anyway, we gotta run, kid.

04:41.333 --> 04:42.792
I'll see you later.
Yeah. Me too.

04:42.792 --> 04:43.875
Nice to meet you.

04:43.875 --> 04:45.000
You too.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.458
Bye.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.709
Smell you later.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.291
It's wildly inappropriate,
but I love that butt thing.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.750
I know!
I think that's gonna
be our thing.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.250
It's, like, our thing now
that we have together.

04:56.542 --> 04:57.583
(door opens)

04:57.583 --> 04:59.458
Um, Ms. Snodgrass wondered
if you had a moment.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.458
What are you doing, Swift?

05:00.458 --> 05:01.917
You announce
that someone's here,

05:01.917 --> 05:03.250
you see if I'm ready
to see them,

05:03.250 --> 05:05.166
then you bring them in.
You don't do it all at once.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.166
(whispers)
Sorry.

05:06.166 --> 05:07.375
(whines)
"I'm sorry."

05:07.375 --> 05:09.542
Are you sorry though?
'Cause you keep doing it.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.709
You are dismissed.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.166
Thank you. Thanks.

05:13.166 --> 05:15.208
This a bad time?
No, it's fine.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.375
Trying to break her in.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.709
Treat her like shit,
so she'll be better.
Okay.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.750
Just looking at some pictures
of my daughter.
Oh, yeah?

05:20.750 --> 05:23.041
Can I see?
Yeah, if you want to.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.625
Some snaps I took of her.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.750
Oh, look at her!
Yeah, I bought that horse.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.709
She looks just like ya.

05:29.709 --> 05:31.041
Actually she doesn't.

05:31.041 --> 05:33.375
She carries around a lot
of weight for a girl her age.

05:33.375 --> 05:36.291
It's from her mom's side.
Oh, she'll grow out of that.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.083
I had a lot of chub on me
when I was her age.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.166
I find that hard to believe.

05:40.166 --> 05:43.041
I bet you were every bit
as attractive at 13
as you are now.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.125
Nope. No, no.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.583
I was quite a mess.

05:46.583 --> 05:47.792
Well, Janelle is going through

05:47.792 --> 05:50.959
her own little
messy stage right now too.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.417
She's gotten into motocross.

05:52.417 --> 05:53.500
Motocross?
Yeah.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.917
With motorcycles
and dirt bikes,

05:54.917 --> 05:56.583
jumping over ramps
and hills.
Yeah.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.166
I know. I love motocross.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.500
My older brother
used to ride.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.959
Me, him, and my dad would go
down to the track all the time.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.333
It was awesome.

06:04.333 --> 06:07.333
Oh, well, maybe it's changed
since you used to be involved

06:07.333 --> 06:08.709
with it 'cause now
it's not awesome.

06:08.709 --> 06:10.208
I mean, she was
into horseback riding,

06:10.208 --> 06:12.166
which is, like,
a classic hobby, you know?
Mm-hmm.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.291
Dignified, less rednecky.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.917
I just got a lot
of mixed emotions
when it comes to motocross.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.959
Um, well, if she's into it,

06:18.959 --> 06:20.917
then maybe
you should give it a shot.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.083
Get involved.
Huh.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.000
Wow.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.667
You may have something there.
Mm-hmm.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.375
I mean, if she's into motocross,

06:28.375 --> 06:30.041
and motocross is Ray's thing,

06:30.041 --> 06:31.792
then I should
just make it my thing.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.709
That's good.
Who's Ray?

06:33.709 --> 06:35.625
He's a man
with limited abilities.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.333
I'm gonna master his talents
and render him useless.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.625
Thank you for that.
I appreciate it.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.583
Yeah, you're welcome.
Wow.

06:41.583 --> 06:44.959
Is there, uh, something
you wanted my help with?

06:44.959 --> 06:46.208
Oh, yes! Um...

06:46.208 --> 06:47.917
uh, the last six weeks,

06:47.917 --> 06:49.291
I had planning seventh period,

06:49.291 --> 06:52.125
and then this six weeks,
it got shifted to second period,

06:52.125 --> 06:53.458
which is just...
(sputters)

06:53.458 --> 06:55.500
So, I was just wondering,
can I get it back to seventh?

06:55.500 --> 06:56.583
Cinchy.
Yeah?

06:56.583 --> 06:57.792
Yeah, you came
to the right place.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.333
That's awesome!
Yeah.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.417
You want seventh period
planning? You got it.
Great. Yes.

07:01.417 --> 07:04.667
I'll put you on the list.
You'll have it next term.
Um, next term?

07:04.667 --> 07:06.458
After Christmas?
Mm-hmm.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.834
Oh, I'm gonna
need it now actually.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.500
Oh, well, Ms. Snodgrass,
I appreciate your help
with motocross,

07:11.500 --> 07:13.959
but school policy states
a teacher can't shift

07:13.959 --> 07:15.667
their schedule
during a grading cycle.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.250
Has to happen
in between cycles.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.083
There's no wiggle room
in there?

07:20.083 --> 07:21.500
No wiggly room.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.875
Anything else?

07:22.875 --> 07:24.041
No, no. Thanks.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.834
Are you sure you're okay?
Oh, yeah.

07:25.834 --> 07:27.583
You look like
you're about to throw up.
Mm-mm.

07:27.583 --> 07:30.166
I'm still trying
to picture you fat,
and I just can't picture it.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.166
Oh. (chuckles)
You know?

07:32.166 --> 07:33.667
Go ahead and leave
the door open.
Okay.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.000
Yeah. I'm just kidding.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.834
I just wanted to see
your body again.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.041
Go on. It's fine. It's over.

07:40.041 --> 07:41.041
Okay.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.000
Turn around, Swift.

07:45.208 --> 07:47.166
Come on, come on, come on.
(beeping)

07:47.166 --> 07:48.542
Come on back.

07:48.542 --> 07:49.792
Come on.

07:49.792 --> 07:51.542
See my hand?

07:51.542 --> 07:54.041
Come on! Come on!
Back! Back! Stop!

07:54.041 --> 07:55.417
Fucking... God!

07:55.417 --> 07:57.000
Freaking idiot.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.542
Think I might have
clipped your satellite dish.

08:03.542 --> 08:06.291
Is this all of 'em?
All 600. Western Lit.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.000
(exhales)
Eggs with Legs is
kicking a hornet's nest.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.333
LeBlanc will rally every teacher
and student against Brown.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.458
This calls for pizza.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.917
I say margherita.
What say you?
I can't.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.417
I gotta go home
and study motocross.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.125
That's all my daughter
cares about these days.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.125
I thought she was into horses.
Yeah, she was,

08:21.125 --> 08:23.834
until Ray got her invested
in something I know
dick all about.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.208
I can't believe you have
a nemesis named Ray.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.375
What a stupid fucking name.

08:27.375 --> 08:28.792
(gasps)

08:28.792 --> 08:30.917
(yelling in Korean)

08:30.917 --> 08:32.542
Go-- Just go
the fuck back inside.

08:33.417 --> 08:34.458
Oh, fuck! A spoon?

08:34.458 --> 08:36.041
You're gonna fucking throw
a spoon at me?

08:36.041 --> 08:37.500
Russell--
Get your fucking ass inside!

08:37.500 --> 08:39.417
Take care, bud.
Just get-- Just get inside!

08:39.417 --> 08:42.709
(yells)
I will dig up
all your fucking kimchi!

08:49.625 --> 08:50.709
Whoo!

08:52.250 --> 08:53.625
Yeah!

08:55.166 --> 08:56.583
Gale:
You're a natural, baby.

08:56.583 --> 08:57.959
Beautiful!
Yeah?

08:57.959 --> 09:00.083
That was gorgeous.
Yeah.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.166
Janelle!

09:03.166 --> 09:05.166
Whoa, it's Dad.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.333
Awesome day
for a motorcycle race.
Ray: Wow, Neal.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.625
I never knew you rode.
Yeah, of course
I ride, Ray.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.542
I don't know what
the big fucking deal is.

09:13.542 --> 09:14.709
Fuck.
Gale: Ridiculous.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.333
How much did you spend
on that, Neal?

09:16.333 --> 09:17.792
This bike is a pretty penny.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.333
This is a sweet bike, man.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.458
Goddammit, Ray.

09:20.458 --> 09:21.625
Get off my bike.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.458
I bought the motorcycle
with the blood money I got

09:23.458 --> 09:24.792
for selling Shadowfax.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.792
I thought you said
that money was going
towards my college fund.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.125
Since you decided
to pursue motocross,

09:28.125 --> 09:29.625
I assumed you're not
going to college.

09:29.625 --> 09:30.917
Neal!
Gale!

09:30.917 --> 09:32.625
I can say
your first name too, okay?

09:32.625 --> 09:34.750
You're not special.
Don't act like you are.
It's okay, Dad.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.291
I'm just glad
you're into motocross now.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.500
Isn't it cool?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.208
Honestly, sweetheart,
no, it's not cool.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.458
But you're my daughter,

09:40.458 --> 09:42.667
so I'm gonna be invested
in anything that you are

09:42.667 --> 09:43.792
because I love you.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.959
I love you too, Daddy.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.125
That's awesome.
Janelle: Ray,

09:47.125 --> 09:49.291
you gotta show Daddy
how you can do wheelies.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.959
Gale: Yeah.
Janelle: You gotta see him.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.250
Do one, baby.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.291
It's awesome.

09:53.291 --> 09:54.667
Like the coolest thing
in the world.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.208
A wheelie the coolest
thing in the world?

09:56.208 --> 09:57.250
Janelle: Yeah.
Gale: Whoo!

09:57.250 --> 09:59.583
Braap braap!
Braap, braap! Yeah, Ray!

09:59.583 --> 10:00.667
Braap!

10:00.667 --> 10:02.917
(engine revs)
Yeah!

10:02.917 --> 10:05.000
Gale:
Yeah, Ray!
Braap, braap!

10:06.500 --> 10:07.750
Gale and Janelle:
Whoo!

10:07.750 --> 10:10.041
Yeah, Ray!
Braap, braap!

10:10.041 --> 10:12.166
Yeah, actually,
wheelies are pretty cinchy.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.834
Can you do a wheelie?
Yeah, Neal, can you?

10:14.834 --> 10:16.709
You know, I came here
to support Janelle,

10:16.709 --> 10:18.375
not be
an attention hog like Ray.

10:18.375 --> 10:19.959
The motherfucker's still up!

10:19.959 --> 10:21.750
Gale and Janelle:
Whoo!

10:21.750 --> 10:22.834
Oh, my gosh!

10:24.291 --> 10:26.333
That's my step-daddy.
Yeah.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.500
(applause)

10:27.500 --> 10:28.875
That boy good.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.375
Boy:
"I've lost my reputation.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.250
My reputation, Iago."

10:32.250 --> 10:33.917
"I thought you had
received some bodily wound.

10:33.917 --> 10:36.125
"There is more sense
in that than reputation.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.583
"Reputation is an idle
and most false imposition

10:38.583 --> 10:41.375
oft got without merit,
and lost without deserving."

10:41.375 --> 10:42.583
Wait, stop.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.083
How would you feel
if I called you a big,
dumb jerk?

10:45.083 --> 10:46.166
(laughter)

10:46.166 --> 10:48.208
I would be impugning
your reputation, wouldn't I?

10:48.208 --> 10:49.875
And what if you
couldn't fight back,

10:49.875 --> 10:52.542
which, of course, you can't
because I'm a helpless old lady?

10:52.542 --> 10:55.083
(laughter)
That's what's happened
to Cassio.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.375
His reputation is ruined.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.125
Iago, the liar,
tries to comfort him.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.709
But the thing is,
our bodies recover.

11:00.709 --> 11:02.500
Our reputations,
on the other hand--

11:03.542 --> 11:04.792
Final analysis.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.875
Defend your reputation
with your life,

11:06.875 --> 11:08.000
for it is everything.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.208
Now please continue
to work independently

11:10.208 --> 11:13.083
for the rest of class
while I attend to our visitors.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.834
So what is this
very urgent issue?

11:15.834 --> 11:17.500
We'll try not to take up
too much of your time.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.166
Every minute of my class time
is valuable, Dr. Brown.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.834
You know what else
is valuable? Textbooks.

11:22.834 --> 11:25.000
Now, tell me, Ms. LeBlanc,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.667
is that your signature
right there?

11:26.667 --> 11:27.792
Western Lit. Yeah.

11:27.792 --> 11:29.083
600 copies of?

11:29.083 --> 11:30.834
Of course not. 60 maybe.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.083
Well, 600 copies
were delivered.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.166
Well, somebody added
a zero to my order.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.625
Just send them back.

11:36.625 --> 11:39.542
We'd love to,
but we can't seem
to find the textbooks anywhere.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.000
They've just upped
and disappeared.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.375
Are you accusing
me of something?

11:43.375 --> 11:44.542
Oh, no, ma'am.

11:44.542 --> 11:46.625
Ain't no reason
to get all defensive now.

11:46.625 --> 11:49.250
Ain't no reason
for double negatives, Dr. Brown.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.458
You correcting my English now?

11:51.458 --> 11:52.875
Well, I am an English teacher.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.625
I am not an underground
book dealer.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.291
I did not order 600 books

11:56.291 --> 11:57.917
nor did I receive 600 books.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.458
Case closed.
No.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.041
Case is not closed.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.917
Not until we get
to the bottom of this.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.834
(school bell chimes)

12:05.834 --> 12:07.625
I need to prepare
for my next class,

12:07.625 --> 12:08.750
so if there's nothing else?

12:08.750 --> 12:10.125
That'll be all.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.250
Good.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.917
Okay, so when
you split an infinitive,

12:15.917 --> 12:17.875
you're putting something,
usually an adverb,

12:17.875 --> 12:19.041
in between two--
Ms. Snodgrass?

12:19.041 --> 12:21.041
Could I please speak
to you outside for a moment?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.458
Students:
Ooh!

12:22.458 --> 12:24.834
Get a life.

12:24.834 --> 12:28.291
Okay, I will give you
planning period back on seventh

12:28.291 --> 12:29.917
if you teach me to ride

12:29.917 --> 12:32.000
this stupid fucking
motorcycle I bought.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.250
You bought a motorcycle?

12:33.250 --> 12:35.083
Yeah. You told me to.
You told me to get involved.

12:35.083 --> 12:38.000
But what you didn't tell me
is that motocross is
hard as shit.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.166
And Ray's actually
pretty good at it.

12:40.166 --> 12:43.000
He popped a wheelie and rode it
longer than anyone I've ever
seen before.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.875
It was like watching
a supernatural being.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.417
He went twelve o'clock, huh?

12:46.417 --> 12:47.417
What-- what's that?

12:47.417 --> 12:48.875
It's a term for a wheelie.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.333
It's what my brother
used to call it.

12:50.333 --> 12:53.834
Okay, well, can you teach me
to go twelve o'clock?

12:53.834 --> 12:55.834
First things first,
you want to show me
what you got.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.834
Let's have you do a...
a lap around the field.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.166
Just zip around?
Yep.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.333
Okay.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.125
Hit the jammer here.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.333
Uh, Neal, pull the clutch in.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.417
Okay. I got it. Yeah, yeah.
Nice and smooth
on the throttle.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.291
Stop hovering, okay?
You're making me nervous.

13:10.291 --> 13:12.125
Back up. Back it up.
Okay.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.917
Goddammit.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.375
(engine revs)

13:43.834 --> 13:45.375
Whoa.
Aah! Fuck!

13:45.375 --> 13:46.750
Hey, you got it?
Yeah, yeah.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.792
Yup. Bam. There we go.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.417
Um, well, you need
to loosen up.

13:50.417 --> 13:52.000
You look, uh,
you look awkward.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.709
I feel like I look pretty cool.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.250
No, you do not.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.792
Once you feel comfortable,

13:56.792 --> 13:59.667
it'll all come naturally,
so just practice a bunch.

13:59.667 --> 14:00.917
Practice a bunch.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.250
That's what
you got for me?
Mm-hmm.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.875
I-- I don't have time
to practice a bunch.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.417
My daughter's motocross
is in two days.

14:05.417 --> 14:07.750
Uh, well,
you better get lapping.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.542
And good luck.
I'm excited for you.

14:09.542 --> 14:12.125
Can I have
seventh period back now?
No, ma'am.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.166
The deal was for you
to teach me how to
go twelve o'clock,

14:14.166 --> 14:16.625
not give me some bullshit,
broad strokes lesson.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.834
Oh, come on, Neal.
You come on.
This is what you got for me?

14:18.834 --> 14:21.083
I come out here
and you're just gonna
watch me go around one time?

14:21.083 --> 14:23.834
I gave you some solid advice.
Oh, to believe in myself?

14:23.834 --> 14:25.250
What a disappointment.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.458
Okay, well, thank you.
Thank you.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.291
No. No thank you.
Bye.

14:28.291 --> 14:29.750
Yes. Goodbye.

14:29.750 --> 14:33.083
(knock on door)
Belinda: Knock, knock.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.291
Ms. LeBlanc, we got off
on the wrong foot.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.667
May I get a redo?

14:36.667 --> 14:38.792
Dr. Brown, I understand
what's going on here.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.834
You have lost
hundreds of books

14:40.834 --> 14:42.917
through mismanagement,
and you need a scapegoat.

14:42.917 --> 14:45.000
You are a two-bit,
flavor-of-the-month principal.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.458
I teach children.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.625
Without me,
there is no education.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.041
Without you, who cares?

14:50.041 --> 14:52.959
How many people
remember that one
great principal they had?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.792
Zero. That's how many.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.000
Exactly zero.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.542
You think I'm unmemorable?

14:57.542 --> 14:59.625
You keep talking,
you uppity hippie.

14:59.625 --> 15:02.125
I will take those Birkenstocks

15:02.125 --> 15:04.125
and shove 'em up
your pretentious ass.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.125
Threats now?
This is outrageous.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.750
I'm calling Superintendent Haas.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.125
You have crossed
the wrong bitch.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.125
I'll give you something
to remember.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.458
Watch your face.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.583
All right, guys, it's time to
write down those study questions

15:18.583 --> 15:21.500
for Elizabeth Barrett Browning's
"If Thou Must Love Me."

15:21.500 --> 15:24.500
Question one, why does
the speaker want to be loved?

15:24.500 --> 15:29.625
Question two,
for how long does the speaker
hope to be loved for?

15:38.709 --> 15:40.667
Gamby:
Do you know what happens
to kids your age

15:40.667 --> 15:42.500
if you smoke
too much marijuana?

15:42.500 --> 15:43.625
You grow tits.

15:43.625 --> 15:46.125
Giant turkey tits
hanging down to your knees.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.583
Your estrogen levels
get messed up

15:47.583 --> 15:49.250
and you'll have
breasts out to here

15:49.250 --> 15:51.000
by the time you're seniors.
Mr. Gamby?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.125
Do you mind
if I have a word?

15:52.125 --> 15:54.166
Students:
Ooh!

15:54.166 --> 15:55.458
Man, shut the fuck up.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.875
If you want to go
twelve o'clock, Neal,

16:01.875 --> 16:03.542
you gotta believe.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.709
Okay. I believe.
Now what?

16:05.709 --> 16:07.917
Now you get comfortable.

16:07.917 --> 16:09.417
Hop on.

16:11.208 --> 16:12.333
Okay.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.542
Okay.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.166
Ooh--
Ooh, no. I'm sorry.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.709
What are you doing?
I'm just trying
to be respectful.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.875
Well, give me your hands.

16:23.875 --> 16:24.917
Okay.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.166
Snodgrass: Whoo!
Gamby: Whoa!

16:28.166 --> 16:30.375
♪ ♪

17:04.375 --> 17:05.583
Snodgrass:
That's it!

17:06.917 --> 17:07.917
Nice!

22:40.625 --> 22:43.000

the union in,

22:47.291 --> 22:48.709

whoever you want.

22:57.792 --> 22:59.166

(people screaming)

27:33.041 --> 27:35.208
Neal! Neal!
It's okay.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.750
Snodgrass:
Oh, my God! Neal!

27:36.750 --> 27:37.959
What are you doing, asshole?

27:37.959 --> 27:39.500
Ray, you know
this fucking idiot?

27:39.500 --> 27:40.917
Yeah. I'm sorry, Mike.

27:40.917 --> 27:43.542
He's an inexperienced rider.
I've done it one time before!

27:43.542 --> 27:45.875
Get him the fuck out of here
before he kills somebody!

27:45.875 --> 27:47.083
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

27:47.083 --> 27:49.375
Goddammit, I got this, Ray!
Reset the bike.

27:49.375 --> 27:52.250
I'm gonna do it again!
Dad you're ruining
this for me.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.667
You're not making it fun.

27:53.667 --> 27:57.000
Every time you come,
there's all this pressure.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.917
I'm just trying to be
a part of your hobbies.

Neal.

28:00.250 --> 28:02.125
I hate to do this, but...

28:02.125 --> 28:05.417
track manager says
if you don't leave,
he's gonna call the cops.

28:09.834 --> 28:11.417
I'm already leaving.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.208

Those books weren't there.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.792

28:20.792 --> 28:22.166
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.333
No biggie, B.
I got your back on this.

28:24.333 --> 28:25.750
And for this to be
an oversight?

28:25.750 --> 28:27.458
I know.
And with this woman
in particular,

28:27.458 --> 28:29.166
the biggest bitch in the school.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.625
It's almost like
I was led to a trap.

28:31.625 --> 28:35.125
Oh, well, you being
paranoid now, B.

28:35.125 --> 28:36.458
I'll tell you what.

28:37.458 --> 28:41.709
Let me make
your special afternoon coffee.
