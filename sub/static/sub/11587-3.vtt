male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.508 --> 00:11.312
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.714
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.714 --> 00:15.683
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.683 --> 00:17.218
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.218 --> 00:19.153
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.489
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:33.201 --> 00:37.638
- CAPTAIN.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU COME IN.

00:37.638 --> 00:42.376
- PROBABLY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME
WITHOUT THE ORANGE JUMPSUIT.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.745
- GLAD TO BE BACK?
- SURE.

00:44.745 --> 00:49.750
JUST CHECKING THAT HARRIS DIDN'T
STEAL MY FAVORITE STAPLER.

00:49.750 --> 00:54.655
- LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU--
- YEAH.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.259
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.595
I'M GLAD TO SEE THE PLACE
HASN'T FALLEN APART ENTIRELY.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.232
- WASN'T THE SAME WITHOUT YOU,
CAPTAIN.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.301
- I TOOK A TWO-WEEK COFFEE BREAK
AND NOBODY NOTICED.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.270
- I DON'T THINK SO.

01:09.270 --> 01:13.541
I SEE HARRIS HAD YOU FILING
DAILY MEMO BOOKS, MILEAGE LOGS.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.243
- LOTS OF BUSYWORK.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.377
- BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM
TO SLOW YOU DOWN.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.445
YOU CLEARED ME.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.313
SO LET'S KEEP IT UP,

01:19.313 --> 01:21.149
TRY FOLLOWING
THE RULES FOR A CHANGE.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.783
- THERE'S RULES,
AND THEN THERE'S BUREAUCRACY.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.618
- TRY FOLLOWING BOTH.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.755
WOULDN'T HURT TO COLOR
INSIDE THE LINES FOR A WHILE.

01:27.755 --> 01:31.625
ALL OF US.

01:31.625 --> 01:36.264
OH, AND, UH,
BY THE WAY...

01:36.264 --> 01:39.333
THANKS.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.470
- WASN'T MY IDEA TO REINVENT
THE LINE DURING A RECESSION.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.138
IT'S HARD ENOUGH SELLING
THIS CRAP TO PEOPLE

01:44.138 --> 01:45.273
WHEN THEY GOT MONEY.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.607
HOLD ON.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.709
I THINK I SEE MY CAR.
DWORKIN?

01:48.709 --> 01:51.812
- UH, DORKIN.
- DWORKIN.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.248
JONAS DWORKIN?
DUCHESS HOTEL?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.884
- YEAH.
SORRY ABOUT THE "W."

01:56.884 --> 01:58.486
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO YOU
WHEN I GET TO THE HOTEL.

01:58.486 --> 02:02.356
FIRST FIVE DRINKS ARE ON YOU.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.258
- TOUGH FLIGHT?

02:04.258 --> 02:05.893
- FLYING COACH FROM KANSAS CITY.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.561
I GOT THREE SCREAMING BABIES.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.164
GUY SITTING NEXT TO ME
MUST HAVE BEEN 600 POUNDS.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.532
GOT ANY VODKA BACK HERE?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.834
- NO, BUT I CAN GO AND GRAB SOME
FOR YOU IF YOU WANT.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.336
- NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.171
- YOU KNOW,
I CAN GET THAT AND MORE,

02:17.171 --> 02:20.208
YOU KNOW, IF YOU, UH, REALLY
WANT TO LET OFF SOME TENSION,

02:20.208 --> 02:21.375
REALLY RELAX.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.277
- YEAH?

02:23.277 --> 02:24.178
- YEAH.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.713
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN MIND?

02:25.713 --> 02:30.184
- WHATEVER YOU DO.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.553
- WHERE YOU GOING?
THERE'S AN OPEN BAR.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.188
ARTISANAL VODKA--
WHATEVER THE HELL THAT MEANS--

02:34.188 --> 02:35.323
IN THE HOSPITALITY SUITE.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.490
- YEAH, I'LL BE THERE, OKAY?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.626
SAVE SOME FOR ME.
- [scoffs]

02:38.626 --> 02:40.728
- EVENING.

02:40.728 --> 02:45.966
THIS IS PILAR.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.203
- HELLO, PILAR.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.538
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:50.538 --> 02:52.840
I CAN'T BRING THAT IN THERE.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.708
IT'S A SALES CONFERENCE.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.809
EVERYBODY KNOWS ME.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.311
- NO PROBLEM.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.380
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
IN THE BACK SEAT.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.591
- [moaning]

03:10.591 --> 03:11.859
- HEY, EYES ON THE ROAD.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.228
- YOU'RE THE BOSS.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.863
VODKA'S IN THE COOLER
ON THE FLOOR.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.266
FIVE BUCKS A POP.

03:18.266 --> 03:21.935
- YOU CAN STOP TALKING NOW.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.873
[moaning and sighing]

03:33.881 --> 03:37.518
[truck horn blares,
tires screech]

03:43.824 --> 03:45.593
- TOWN CAR DRIVER RAN OFF.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.328
THE TWO PASSENGERS
IN THE BACK

03:47.328 --> 03:49.263
KNOCKED AROUND PRETTY GOOD,
BUT RESPONSIVE.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.299
JAWS OF LIFE
IS GETTING THEM OUT.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.267
- SO IT'S
A NON-FATAL TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.968
WHY ARE YOU CALLING US?
- THE PASSENGERS.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.804
ONE MALE, ONE FEMALE.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.372
HIS PANTS ARE AROUND HIS ANKLES,

03:58.372 --> 04:01.041
AND IT WASN'T THE CRASH
THAT UNZIPPED HIS FLY.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.844
AND LOOK AT THE GIRL.

04:03.844 --> 04:08.949
- SHE'S DRESSED FOR A PARTY.
- HMM.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.519
- HEY, SWEETHEART,
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.321
I'M DETECTIVE BENSON.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.356
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT ON HER NECK.
YOU SEE THAT?

04:15.356 --> 04:18.559
IS THAT A BAR CODE?

04:24.365 --> 04:27.435
- THAT GIRL IS
SOMEBODY'S PROPERTY.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.487
- SO WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME,
PILAR?

05:19.487 --> 05:20.888
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

05:20.888 --> 05:22.756
- THE POLICE MAY NOT CARE
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS

05:22.756 --> 05:24.425
IN YOUR COUNTRY.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.361
WE DO.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.563
- JONES.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.131
I AMERICANIZED IT.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.567
- ALL RIGHT, MISS JONES.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.668
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.136
- 18.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.138
- REALLY.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.041
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T FIND ANY I.D.
IN THE BACK OF THE CAR.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.876
- I DON'T LIKE
TO TAKE MY PURSE WITH ME.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.512
PICKPOCKETS.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.980
- YOU MEAN THE MAN
THAT YOU WORK FOR

05:46.980 --> 05:50.418
DOESN'T LET YOU TAKE
YOUR PAPERS WITH YOU.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.953
- I WAS ON A DATE.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.088
- OKAY, AND YOUR DATE...

05:55.088 --> 05:57.090
WE HAVE HIS I.D.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.461
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?

06:00.461 --> 06:01.895
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.897
- [whispers]
PILAR.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.098
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY TROUBLE.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.900
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.937
WE CAN GET YOU AWAY FROM
THE MAN WHO DID THAT TO YOU.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.740
- THAT IS A JOKE.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.008
IT DON'T MEAN ANYTHING.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.648
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

06:20.648 --> 06:21.649
I WASN'T DRIVING THE CAR.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.617
I DIDN'T CAUSE A CRASH.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.653
- PAYING FOR SEX
IS AGAINST THE LAW.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.756
- ALL I PAID FOR WERE DRINKS.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.158
I COME TO TOWN,
I MEET A GIRL, I GOT LUCKY.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.693
- LUCKY?

06:32.693 --> 06:34.127
- UP TO A POINT.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.830
- YOU HAPPEN TO NOTICE
THE BAR CODE TATTOOED

06:36.830 --> 06:37.531
ON YOUR FRIEND'S NECK?

06:37.531 --> 06:39.032
- I WASN'T LOOKING AT HER NECK.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.734
- YEAH?

06:40.734 --> 06:41.735
WHO WAS DRIVING THE CAR?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.203
- I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.805
I MET HIM OUTSIDE THE HOTEL.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.674
SAID HE WAS GONNA TAKE US
TO A CLUB DOWNTOWN.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.509
- YOU WERE HEADED NORTH.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.511
- HEY, LOOK.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.979
DRIVING IN A LIMO
ISN'T ILLEGAL.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.014
NEITHER IS HAVING SEX.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.115
UNLESS BLOOMBERG PASSED
SOME NEW LAW

06:55.115 --> 06:56.817
I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.853
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP,
MR. DWORKIN.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.021
AND WE'LL BE SURE
TO CALL YOUR WIFE

07:01.021 --> 07:04.825
AND LET HER KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.960
SO THIS TURKEY
GREETING CARD SALESMAN

07:06.960 --> 07:08.662
FLIES IN FROM KANSAS CITY

07:08.662 --> 07:10.230
AND SCORES
WITH A HOT 18-YEAR OLD?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.732
- YEAH, AND SHE LIKES
SWEATY POT BELLIES.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.133
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.668
- BUT HE'S NOT GONNA SAY
HE PAID HER,

07:14.668 --> 07:16.036
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA SAY
HE PAID HER.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.771
- THERE'S NO WAY SHE'S 18.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.972
IF SHE'S 16,
THAT'S STATUTORY RAPE.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.508
- HAS SHE GIVEN YOU ANYTHING?

07:20.508 --> 07:22.810
- SHE'S SCARED
OR BRAINWASHED OR BOTH.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.044
I MEAN, SHE JUST WANTS
TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.779
- BACK TO THE LOVING ARMS
OF HER PIMP.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.648
- SHE'S FROM COLOMBIA
WITH NO I.D.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.583
IF SHE SNUCK INTO THE COUNTRY,
WE CAN HOLD HER.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.818
HOMELAND SECURITY.

07:30.818 --> 07:31.885
- THAT WAY, WE COULD TALK
TO HER.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.054
MAYBE HELP HER COME
TO HER SENSES.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.689
- PATROL PICKED UP
THE DRIVER OF THE TOWN CAR.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.791
THEY'RE BRINGING HIM IN.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.159
- I WAS IN A DAZE, YOU KNOW?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.561
CHECK--
CHECK IT OUT, MAN.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.862
I-I JUST WANDERED OFF.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.497
- LEAVING THE SCENE

07:43.497 --> 07:44.998
OF AN ACCIDENT
CAUSING PERSONAL INJURY--

07:44.998 --> 07:46.166
THAT'S A CRIME.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.535
- SO GIVE ME A TICKET.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.802
- WE CAN DO BETTER THAT THAT.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.739
SEE, WE FOUND
EMPTY VODKA BOTTLES IN YOUR CAR.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.707
THAT'S DRIVING
WHILE INTOXICATED.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.275
LOSE YOUR LICENSE,
SPEND A YEAR IN JAIL.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.710
- WELL, WHO SAYS I WAS DRINKING?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.045
THERE WERE TWO OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE CAR.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.112
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THEM.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.147
START WITH THE GIRL.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.248
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

08:01.248 --> 08:02.783
- YOU KNOW HER?

08:02.783 --> 08:04.585
- NO, SHE HAILED ME
AT THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.086
SHE JUST WANTED ME TO DRIVE
HER AROUND FOR THE NIGHT

08:06.086 --> 08:07.655
WHILE SHE SOCIALIZED.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.256
- ANYONE SEE YOU PICK HER UP?

08:09.256 --> 08:12.793
- UH, 50 DRUNK 20-YEAR-OLDS
FROM NEW JERSEY.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.762
- SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PURSE
OR A WALLET.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.796
HOW DID SHE PAY YOU?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.565
- UH, SHE GAVE ME CASH.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.067
AND THIS.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.269
- PASSPORT.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.038
- SHE ASKED ME TO HOLD IT
IN CASE SHE GOT DRUNK.

08:25.038 --> 08:29.209
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE IT.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.745
- THE D.A. RAN HER PASSPORT.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.581
REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.917
ISSUED TO PILAR MORENAS
RIGHT AFTER HER 17TH BIRTHDAY.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.887
WITH A U.S. VISA
FROM OUR EMBASSY IN BOGOTA.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.855
- SHE'S LEGAL AND SHE'S LEGAL.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.723
- THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.124
- SO WE LET HER WALK OUT
OF THAT HOSPITAL

08:44.124 --> 08:45.759
AND BACK
TO THE GUY WHO BRANDED HER?

08:45.759 --> 08:47.861
- YOU GET ANYTHING
FROM HER DRIVER?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.564
- A CONFESSION THAT HE DELIVERS
WHORES ON WHEELS?

08:50.564 --> 08:52.032
NO. NOT YET.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.202
MR. WIGGINS CLAIMS HE NEVER MET
HER BEFORE LAST NIGHT,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.838
AND THIS PERFECT STRANGER GAVE
HIM HER PASSPORT TO HOLD.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.139
- HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.842
- OR, WHILE HE WAS
IN HIS DAZE,

09:01.842 --> 09:04.177
PILAR'S PIMP HANDED HIM
HER PASSPORT

09:04.177 --> 09:05.713
SO WE'D HAVE
TO RELEASE HER.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.114
I MEAN, PIMPS HANG ONTO
THEIR GIRLS' PASSPORTS

09:07.114 --> 09:08.816
ALL THE TIME,
SO THEY CAN'T RUN.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.350
- DOESN'T MATTER.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.119
THE DRIVER'S NOT TALKING.
THE JOHN'S NOT TALKING.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.855
PILAR IS NOT TALKING.
WE'RE STALLED.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.157
AND, NO, IT'S NOT
BECAUSE I'M SPOOKED

09:17.157 --> 09:19.126
ABOUT GOING AFTER
ANOTHER PROSTITUTION RING.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.694
- CAN WE AT LEAST CHECK THIS
WITH STATE,

09:20.694 --> 09:22.229
AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S LEGIT?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.064
- IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.000
WHILE WE'RE WAITING, LIV,
TAKE ANOTHER RUN AT THE GIRL,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.670
SHE'S OUR BEST BET.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.172
HEY, NICK, NICK.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.813
HOW'RE YOU DOING?
- ME?

09:39.813 --> 09:42.215
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO SPENT
THE WEEK IN RIKERS.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.852
WE'RE CLEARED.
BOTH OF US.

09:44.852 --> 09:49.723
- I WAS ASKING MORE
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY SITUATION.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.659
UH...

09:51.659 --> 09:54.962
MARIA AND I,
WE'RE TALKING.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.130
WENT DOWN TO D.C. LAST WEEKEND.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.399
TOOK ZARA TO THE SPY MUSEUM.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.802
IT WAS QUALITY
FATHER-DAUGHTER TIME.

10:01.802 --> 10:06.674
- ZARA IS WHAT, NOW?
- SIX.

10:06.674 --> 10:11.111
- YOU EVER CONSIDERED THE ZOO?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.213
- I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.948

10:14.948 --> 10:16.950
PILAR, I CAN GET YOU A TICKET.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.352
- NO, I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.054
JUST--JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.391
- PILAR, I CAN PROTECT YOU
FROM YOUR PIMP.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.793
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO BACK TO HIM.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.960
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.295
- I'M JUST GOING TO A FRIEND'S.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.830
- WHAT FRIEND?
- EVERYTHING IS FINE.

10:29.830 --> 10:33.066
- WHAT FRIEND?
WHERE DOES SHE LIVE?

10:33.066 --> 10:34.201
[car door opens]
IS THAT HER?

10:34.201 --> 10:35.302
- PILAR, COME.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.971
- SOFIA.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.742
LISTEN TO ME,
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP HER.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.711
WE CAN HELP YOU TOO.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.146
- NO ONE CAN HELP US.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.380
- PILAR.

10:47.380 --> 10:51.051
[cell phone rings]

10:51.051 --> 10:54.454
YEAH.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.857
WHERE?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.228
- THE BODY WAS SPOTTED
A HALF HOUR AGO.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.363
THE WAY THE TIDES RUN
NEAR HELL GATE,

11:03.363 --> 11:06.800
COULD HAVE GONE IN ANYWHERE
BETWEEN HERE AND CITY ISLAND.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.036
- ANY WITNESSES?
- NOTHING YET.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.904
LOT OF RIVER TO CANVASS.

11:10.904 --> 11:14.708
- SHE'S, UH, FRESH.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.409
BEAT UP PRETTY GOOD.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.745
THEN THERE'S THIS.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.246
- SAME BAR CODE.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.448
SO HE BRANDS 'EM,

11:21.448 --> 11:22.950
HE PIMPS 'EM,

11:22.950 --> 11:24.051
AND KILLS 'EM.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.720
- I WANT THIS GUY.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.165
- NO I.D., NOT IN THE SYSTEM.
SHE'S LATE TEENS.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.033
DENTAL WORK BY SOMEONE
WHO HASN'T READ A JOURNAL

11:40.033 --> 11:41.334
SINCE 1955.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.203
OLD SCAR ON HER RIGHT CHEEK.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.874
FRESH BRUISES
ON HER FACE AND SHOULDERS.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.509
CAUSE OF DEATH--
BLUNT TRAUMA, LOTS OF IT.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.212
- SO NOT SHOT, NOT STABBED.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.181
JUST...HIT.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.249
- SEXUALLY ACTIVE, VERY.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.919
SCARRING AND FIBROTIC CHANGES
TO THE PERINEAL TISSUES,

11:58.919 --> 12:00.754
VAGINAL AND ANAL.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.422
BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEADED
TOWARD TAKING A BREAK.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.791
- WHY?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.225
- SHE WAS PREGNANT.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.527
- BAD FOR BUSINESS.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.930
PIMP MUST HAVE BEEN THRILLED.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.799
- IT'S "GET AN ABORTION.
GET BACK ON THE STREET."

12:11.799 --> 12:15.068
- I ASSUME THIS IS COURTESY
OF WHOEVER EMPLOYED HER?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.170
- IT'S A GOOD BET.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.776
- I DON'T KNOW HER.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.944
- I HOPE THAT'S TRUE.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.946
SHE HAD THE SAME TATTOO

12:25.946 --> 12:27.414
AS THE GIRL YOU WERE DRIVING
THE OTHER NIGHT.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.950
- KIDS.
THEY HAVE THEIR FADS.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.352
- LIKE HAVING SEX WITH STRANGERS
IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.954
- CONSENTING ADULTS.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.422
I LEFT THE SCENE
OF AN ACCIDENT.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.090
SLAP MY WRIST.
CAN I GO?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.258
- YEAH, SURE.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.493
IN ABOUT 25 YEARS.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.395
- [laughs nervously]
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:42.395 --> 12:44.464
- GIRLS YOU WERE DRIVING,
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.266
THEY'RE SEX SLAVES.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.301
- WHICH MAKES YOU AN ACCOMPLICE
TO KIDNAPPING AND RAPE.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.403
AND SINCE THIS GIRL
WAS BEATEN TO DEATH,

12:50.403 --> 12:52.239
YOU'RE LOOKING AT FELONY MURDER.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.007
- THAT'S A HELL OF A STRETCH.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.375
- YEAH, WELL,
WE DON'T MIND STRETCHING.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.477
NEITHER DOES
THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.546
THAT'S TWO AGENCIES
WHO'LL BE POURING

12:59.546 --> 13:02.015
THROUGH YOUR LOGBOOKS,
YOUR CAR'S GPS,

13:02.015 --> 13:04.084
YOUR PHONE RECORDS,
YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS,

13:04.084 --> 13:05.318
LOOKING FOR THE DEAD GIRL'S DNA
IN YOUR CAR.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.855
SO YOU TELL ME,
ARE WE GONNA FIND A LINK

13:07.855 --> 13:09.957
BETWEEN YOU
AND THE GUY WHO DID THIS?

13:09.957 --> 13:12.960
- [groans]
SON OF A BITCH.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.062
- SORRY, IS THAT A YES?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.400
- HIS NAME IS LOU.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.269
HE CALLS,

13:22.269 --> 13:23.570
I PICK THE GIRLS UP
FROM THE SUBWAY,

13:23.570 --> 13:25.405
AND I TAKE 'EM
TO THEIR DATES.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.974
SOMETIMES THEY GO TO A HOTEL.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.843
AND SOMETIMES, UH,
THEY USE THE BACK SEAT.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.979
BUT EITHER WAY,
I GET 50 BUCKS.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.881
ON TOP OF WHATEVER I GET
FROM THE JOHNS.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.116
- AND THEN YOU DRIVE
THE GIRLS HOME?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.952
- NO. UM...

13:38.952 --> 13:42.155
ALWAYS TO A SUBWAY.
UH...

13:42.155 --> 13:45.325
LOU IS--
IS VERY CAREFUL.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.360
- LOU GOT A LAST NAME?
PHONE NUMBER?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.929
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.031
I CALL THE SERVICE.
HE CALLS ME BACK.

13:51.031 --> 13:54.234
- BUT HE DID GIVE YOU PILAR'S
PASSPORT AFTER THE ACCIDENT?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.236
- YES.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.938
I MET HIM AT A--

13:57.938 --> 13:59.339
AT A DINER IN KIPS BAY.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.476
THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE
I'VE EVER MET HIM.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.013
[door opens]

14:06.013 --> 14:07.380
- THAT'S NICE WORK.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.150
- OKAY, LOOK, I GET
A BLACK TOWN CAR FROM C.E.U.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.151
AND I'M GOOD TO GO.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.419
- NICK.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.888
I'M GONNA HAVE FIN TAKE
THIS ONE.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.223
- WHY?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.926
YOU DON'T TRUST ME ALONE
IN A CAR WITH A HOOKER?

14:18.926 --> 14:19.993
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT THE CAPTAIN'S SAYING.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.661
- I TRUST YOU.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.331
BUT IF THIS GOES TO TRIAL,
YOU'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.899
AND I DON'T WANT
SOME DEFENSE ATTORNEY

14:25.899 --> 14:27.334
DREDGING UP BASELESS CHARGES--

14:27.334 --> 14:28.902
- I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE MYSELF
IN A COURTROOM, CAPTAIN.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.905
- MY CALL!
END OF DISCUSSION.

14:42.549 --> 14:47.220

14:47.220 --> 14:49.322
I'M MIKEY.

14:50.590 --> 14:54.161
- SHOW ME YOUR HACK LICENSE.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.998

15:00.033 --> 15:01.301
TOWN CAR, 2007.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.937
- IS IT CLEAN?
WE SERVE AN UPSCALE CLIENTELE.

15:03.937 --> 15:07.174
- YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT 'EM
TO GET THEIR UPSCALE PANTS DIRTY

15:07.174 --> 15:10.077
WHEN THEY PULL 'EM OFF.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.945
MY FRIEND BRIEFED ME.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.147
- WHAT ELSE HE TELL YOU?

15:14.147 --> 15:15.215
- HE TOLD ME 50 BUCKS A TRIP.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.084
80 IF IT GOES OVER AN HOUR.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.118
- AN HOUR NEVER HAPPENS.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.286
WE'RE A VOLUME OPERATION.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.220
WHAT ELSE?
- EYES FRONT.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.488
NO SUDDEN STOPS.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.157
AND WATCH OUT
FOR GARBAGE TRUCKS.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.159
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.728
WHAT IF ONE OF THESE GUYS MAKES
A MESS IN THE BACK OF MY CAR?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.297
WHO CLEANS THAT UP?

15:30.297 --> 15:31.564
- THE GIRLS.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.333
AND YOU TELL ME
IF THEY GIVE ANY PROBLEM.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.136
DON'T TALK TO 'EM,
DON'T TRUST 'EM,

15:36.136 --> 15:40.040
DON'T DO 'EM ANY FAVORS.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.981

I WILL GO IN.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.148

16:55.148 --> 16:57.284
SPRINGING FOR A BED.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.819

YOU'RE A REAL HARD WORKER.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.294
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

17:07.294 --> 17:09.229
BUT YOU PICKED A TOUGH RACKET.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.231

17:19.639 --> 17:23.143
I HOPE HE'S GOT YOU
IN A REAL NICE APARTMENT.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.579
- IT'S A HOUSE.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.815

CORONA?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.383

17:32.085 --> 17:33.720
SEEM A LOT NICER

17:33.720 --> 17:35.155
THAN THE OTHER GIRL I USED

17:35.155 --> 17:40.260
BLONDE.
SHE HAD A SCAR.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.594

17:41.594 --> 17:43.530
- RIGHT HERE ON HER CHEEK.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.797
I FORGET HER NAME.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.435

18:01.314 --> 18:03.383
[engine turns off]

18:08.655 --> 18:10.857

18:10.857 --> 18:13.893
SHE WAS TERRIFIED.
- SO WHAT DO WE GOT?

18:13.893 --> 18:16.796
THEY'RE KEPT IN A HOUSE

18:36.783 --> 18:38.385
I WOULD HAVE TAUGHT
THAT GUY A LESSON.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.553

IT'S NOT TOO BAD.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.255
- OKAY. I'M DRIVING YOU HOME.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.623
I NEED THE ADDRESS.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.892

- NO, NO, NO.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.394
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ON THE SUBWAY
LOOKING LIKE THAT.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.229
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.317
THERE GOES YOUR CIGARETTE MONEY
FOR THE MONTH.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.985

19:45.985 --> 19:49.422
- OOH. SO NOW YOU'RE MAKING
THE RULES HERE, HUH?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.291

20:01.234 --> 20:02.335
- REMEMBER, MIKEY,

20:02.335 --> 20:05.538
DON'T MARK HER UP.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.441

WE'LL SIT ON IT
WHILE YOU GET THE WARRANT.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.255
[phone beeps]

20:22.255 --> 20:25.292
- OKAY.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.603
[car doors open]

20:36.603 --> 20:40.807
[car doors shut]

20:48.648 --> 20:50.550
- BROUGHT YOU BREAKFAST.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.651

20:53.520 --> 20:55.355

20:55.355 --> 20:58.325
HOUSE TRACES TO A LOUIS PAPPAS
AND HIS SON MICHAEL.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.026
D.A.'S READY TO MOVE.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.828
- OKAY, GREAT.
VICTIM SERVICES FOR THE GIRLS?

21:01.828 --> 21:04.063

21:04.063 --> 21:05.565
CAPTAIN, WE GOOD TO GO?

21:05.565 --> 21:07.867

WE'RE DONE FOR NOW.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.337
- WHAT?
- THIS IS LIEUTENANT ALEX EAMES.

21:10.337 --> 21:13.005
SHE'S WORKING A JOINT TASK FORCE
WITH HOMELAND SECURITY.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.074
- HOMELAND SECURITY?
WEREN'T YOU MAJOR CASE?

21:15.074 --> 21:16.075
- USED TO BE.
I'M ON LOAN.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.644
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.712
- REMEMBER THAT PASSPORT
WE ASKED STATE TO CHECK?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.781
- YEAH.
- CONGRATULATE YOURSELVES.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.783
YOU'VE STUMBLED UPON
A TERRORISM CASE.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.685
SO, FOR NOW, YOU STAND DOWN.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.554
- SO WHY THOSE GUYS
ARE HOLDING GIRLS,

21:27.554 --> 21:29.389
FORCING THEM
INTO PROSTITUTION,

21:29.389 --> 21:30.723
WE JUST GO HOME?

21:30.723 --> 21:32.459
- I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.561
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.770
- OFFICIALLY, I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO SAY ANYTHING,

21:43.770 --> 21:45.672
BUT I GET YOUR FRUSTRATION.

21:45.672 --> 21:49.509
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU CANNOT GO
FURTHER THAN THIS ROOM.

21:49.509 --> 21:53.513
THIS STARTED WITH THE PASSPORT
BELONGING TO PILAR MORENAS.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.382
- WE WERE TOLD THAT WAS GENUINE.
- IT WAS.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.350
BUT HER VISA,
THAT WAS FORGED.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.485
WITH THE DISTINCTIVE
CHARACTERISTICS

21:58.485 --> 22:01.554
OF A FORGER NAMED
EKREM PETAR.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.089
HE'S BOSNIAN.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.457
HE WORKS FOR SEX TRAFFICKERS,

22:04.457 --> 22:06.493
AND FOR A SPLINTER
AL-QAEDA GROUP

22:06.493 --> 22:07.927
IN THE CAUCASUS.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.430
- ARE YOU TELLING US THE
WORKING GIRLS ARE TERRORISTS?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.098
- NO.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.633
PETER FORGES VISAS
FOR THE SEX TRAFFICKERS

22:13.633 --> 22:15.001
FOR THE MONEY.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.404
HE SUPPLIES TERRORISTS
FOR THE CAUSE.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.038
- I STILL DON'T SEE WHY
IT SHUTS US DOWN?

22:19.038 --> 22:21.674
- WE'VE PICKED UP CHATTER
THAT A TERRORIST,

22:21.674 --> 22:23.876
USING DOCUMENTS FORGED
BY PETAR,

22:23.876 --> 22:25.512
WILL BE COMING
INTO THE UNITED STATES

22:25.512 --> 22:26.979
TO JOIN AN OPERATIVE
WHO IS ALREADY HERE

22:26.979 --> 22:28.548
TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.383
- I WORKED
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.419
THERE'S A HUNDRED FALSE ALARMS
FOR EVERY REAL ONE.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.487
- WE DON'T THINK
THIS ONE'S FALSE.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.456
- FINE. YOU KNOW
THIS PERSON'S COMING.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.425
YOU KNOW
WHAT HIS DOCUMENTS LOOK LIKE.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.959
NAB HIM WHEN HE LANDS.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.729
- WE WANT TO PICK HIM UP
AFTER HE JOINS HIS ACCOMPLICE,

22:42.729 --> 22:44.597
SO WE CAN GET THEM BOTH.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.065
THAT WON'T HAPPEN
IF HE HEARS

22:46.065 --> 22:49.536
A SEX RING USING
THE SAME VISAS GOT BUSTED.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.070
IF HE THINKS WE'RE ON
TO THE FORGERIES,

22:51.070 --> 22:52.672
HE COULD COME IN
WITH OTHER PAPERS.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.542
AND WE DO NOT WANT
TO MISS THIS GUY.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.610
- SO WE JUST LET THESE BASTARDS
KEEP OPERATING?

22:57.610 --> 22:59.479
- AFTER WE HAVE THE TERRORISTS,

22:59.479 --> 23:00.780
YOU CAN RAID THE PAPPASES,
ARREST THEM,

23:00.780 --> 23:02.682
SHAKE AND BAKE THEM
HOWEVER YOU'D LIKE.

23:02.682 --> 23:03.850
- AND WHEN DO YOU EXPECT
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN?

23:03.850 --> 23:05.452
WHEN'S YOUR TERRORIST DUE?

23:05.452 --> 23:07.787
- SOON...WE HOPE.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.922
- HOPE. NICE.
- OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE.

23:09.922 --> 23:13.092
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT.

23:13.092 --> 23:16.963
[chair clatters]

23:16.963 --> 23:18.531
- I KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS.

23:18.531 --> 23:21.901
- DO YOU?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.537
HOW LONG WERE YOU MAJOR CASE?
- 11 YEARS.

23:24.537 --> 23:25.938
MY PARTNER MOVED ON,

23:25.938 --> 23:27.707
AND I DECIDED IT WAS TIME
FOR A CHANGE.

23:27.707 --> 23:31.578
- I COULDN'T DO THAT,
BECAUSE SVU IS TOO IMPORTANT.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.613
- I'M AWARE OF THAT.
- ARE YOU?

23:33.613 --> 23:36.849
THESE GIRLS ARE ENSLAVED.
THEY'RE RAPED EVERY NIGHT.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.518
- I GET IT.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.919
- THEN HOW CAN YOU ASK US
TO STAND DOWN?

23:39.919 --> 23:41.921
- YOU WERE HERE FOR 9/11?

23:41.921 --> 23:45.525
THIS IS THE RIGHT DECISION.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.096
- HOW HIGH UP DID THIS GO?
- VERY.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.532
UNTIL WE GET THE GREEN LIGHT,

23:52.532 --> 23:54.867
IT'S HANDS OFF
THE PAPPASES' OPERATION.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.469
- SO WHAT IF WE DON'T GO
AFTER THE OPERATION?

23:56.469 --> 23:59.105
- YEAH.
I MEAN, THERE ARE ROUTINE

23:59.105 --> 24:01.574
ANTI-PROSTITUTION SWEEPS
ALL THE TIME.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.476
- YEAH, AND IF ONE OR TWO
OF THE PAPPASES' GIRLS

24:03.476 --> 24:05.111
GET PICKED UP
PURELY BY CHANCE,

24:05.111 --> 24:06.579
- I MEAN, NOBODY'S GONNA SUSPECT

24:06.579 --> 24:08.247
THAT WE KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FORGED VISAS.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.083
- JUST A BUNCH OF DUMB COPS
GOING ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.085
- BOY, YOU PEOPLE REALLY
GOT USED TO

24:13.085 --> 24:16.689
ROGUE OPERATIONS
WHILE I WAS GONE, DIDN'T YOU?

24:18.591 --> 24:21.694
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.
IF I SAY STOP, YOU STOP.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.636
- HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
DOING TONIGHT, SOFIA?

24:29.636 --> 24:31.638
WANT ME TO TAKE YOU ANYWHERE
IN PARTICULAR?

24:31.638 --> 24:35.174
- JUST DRIVE.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.677
- I CAN STOP AND GET SOME BOOZE
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.745
- JUST DRIVE, PLEASE.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.913
[siren wails, stops]

24:40.913 --> 24:44.751
- OH, MAN.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.052
DAMN TAXI COPS.

24:46.052 --> 24:50.623
WHAT DO THEY WANT NOW?

25:02.635 --> 25:05.004
- I DON'T SEE A TLC DECAL
ON YOUR RIGHT REAR WINDOW.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.606
- COME ON.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.074
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THE RULES.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.842
- I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.611
- THREE DECALS: RIGHT FRONT,
RIGHT REAR AND LEFT REAR.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.546
- I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOUR SEAT BELTS ARE OPERATIONAL.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.247
THANK YOU,
COME ON OUT SIR.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.617
- MAYBE THEY FELL OFF.
- CAN I SEE YOUR LICENSE, SIR?

25:17.617 --> 25:20.219
COME OUT OF THE CAR, SIR,
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE TRUNK.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.755
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GET
ANOTHER CAR.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.557
- NO, NO.
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

25:24.557 --> 25:27.594
THE RIGHT REAR SEAT BELT
IS NON-OPERABLE.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.095
REALLY SHOULD HAVE BUCKLED UP.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.063
AND IF YOU ASK
FOR THE AIR-CONDITIONING

25:31.063 --> 25:33.600
TO BE TURNED ON,
DID YOUR DRIVER COMPLY?

25:33.600 --> 25:35.001
- WHAT?
- IT'S YOUR RIGHT.

25:35.001 --> 25:39.271
- NO, NO.
THE TEMPERATURE WAS FINE.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.741
- IS THIS YOUR HUSBAND,
MA'AM?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.576
- HE'S A FRIEND.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.646
- I THINK I'LL WALK FROM HERE.
[clears throat]

25:46.646 --> 25:50.016
- SOME FRIEND.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.918
YOU KNOW, I COULD BE WRONG HERE,

25:51.918 --> 25:52.919
BUT IF YOU'RE
INTO SOMETHING--

25:52.919 --> 25:56.589
- I'M WALKING TOO.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.660
- TOTAL BUST.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.629
- YEAH, NO LEVERAGE.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.163
THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING
IN THE BACK SEAT.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.765
- CAN I HELP IT
IF THE GUY'S SLOW?

26:05.765 --> 26:06.833
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

26:06.833 --> 26:10.236
JUMP BACK THERE AND COACH HIM?

26:10.236 --> 26:11.938
- PLAN "B"?

26:11.938 --> 26:13.773
- CALL LOU'S SERVICE.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.108
ASK FOR ANNA,
THE GIRL I DROVE LAST TIME.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.778
SHE SEEMED UNHAPPY ENOUGH
TO JUMP.

26:18.778 --> 26:22.148
- IS CRAGEN GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT WITH THAT?

26:22.148 --> 26:24.651
- HE'LL BE OKAY.
WE'LL BE WATCHING.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.088
- OKAY.
CAMERA'S WORKING.

26:33.259 --> 26:37.396
HEY, SHOULD I, UH, KEEP
MY HANDS WHERE YOU CAN SEE 'EM?

26:37.396 --> 26:38.898
- IS HE EVER GONNA GET
OVER THIS?

26:38.898 --> 26:40.867
- HE WILL.
LET IT GO.

26:40.867 --> 26:44.937
[knocks on door]

26:52.411 --> 26:54.146
- UH, MR. MARTINEZ?

26:54.146 --> 26:55.648

26:55.648 --> 26:57.717
COME IN.

27:00.352 --> 27:04.323
PLEASE.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.992
YOU WANT A DRINK?

27:05.992 --> 27:08.294
- NO.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.029
YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.330
- HEH.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.900
ARE COMPLIMENTS PART
OF THE SERVICE?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.836
- ARE YOU HERE ON BUSINESS
OR...

27:16.836 --> 27:18.237
OR WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

27:18.237 --> 27:20.172
- MIAMI.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.374
- CAN I SEE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE?

27:22.374 --> 27:25.211
- NOT HIRING YOU
FOR A DRIVING LESSON.

27:25.211 --> 27:29.716
- SOMETIMES, THERE IS JUST...

27:29.716 --> 27:32.318
POLICE. SO.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.754
- SURE.

27:34.754 --> 27:38.390
[clears throat]

27:43.930 --> 27:45.431
[laughs]

27:45.431 --> 27:48.367
IT'S A FLORIDA LICENSE.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.002
- OKAY.

27:54.373 --> 27:58.210
- [clears throat]

28:02.081 --> 28:04.116
NOW WHAT?

28:04.116 --> 28:06.485
- WHATEVER YOU WANT.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.921
IT'S 300 FOR STRAIGHT.

28:08.921 --> 28:12.759
- I FORGOT TO SHOW YOU THIS.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.126
- [gasps]
- HEY, ANNA.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.362
LOOK, WE WANT TO HELP YOU.
both: ANNA.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.463
- IT'LL BE OKAY.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.398
WE'RE NOT HERE TO ARREST YOU.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.432
- IT'S LOU AND MIKEY, OKAY?

28:20.432 --> 28:22.368
THEY'RE GOING DOWN.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.837
- THEY'RE--THEY'RE GOING
TO KILL ME.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.740
- LIKE THEY KILLED
YOUR FRIEND?

28:27.740 --> 28:30.476
THE ONE WHO WAS PREGNANT?

28:30.476 --> 28:34.146
ANNA, WE'RE GONNA
KEEP YOU SAFE.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.115
- THAT'S A PROMISE.

28:48.194 --> 28:52.431
- HER NAME WAS VIKA.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.867
MIKEY TOOK HER
TO GET THE ABORTION.

28:54.867 --> 28:57.770
A DOCTOR IN JACKSON HEIGHTS.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.972
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS GOING
TO RUN.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.441
- YOU SAY MIKEY DID IT?
NOT HIS DAD?

29:02.441 --> 29:06.012
- HIS SON IS...

29:06.012 --> 29:07.914
A IDIOT.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.182
ALL HE DOES IS GROPE US

29:10.182 --> 29:13.252
AND...

29:13.252 --> 29:15.788
MAKE US DO THINGS.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.890
[door opens]
I LET HIM SOMETIMES.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.959
- SHE ANSWERED AN AD
FOR A NANNY JOB.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.961
- PROBABLY THOUGHT
SHE'D BE WORKING

29:21.961 --> 29:23.129
FOR SOME RICH FAMILY
ON FIFTH AVENUE.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.797
- THEY SENT HER TO MEXICO FIRST,

29:24.797 --> 29:26.899
WHERE SHE WAS...BROKEN IN.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.169
- AND THEN
THE PAPPASES BOUGHT HER.

29:30.169 --> 29:33.840
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE...

29:33.840 --> 29:38.978
MIKEY LOCKED ME UP
WITH NO CLOTHES.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.914
HE KEPT COMING BACK.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.083
AND HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY,

29:44.083 --> 29:46.352
"WELCOME TO AMERICA."

29:49.155 --> 29:54.026
- SO THERE'S YOU, THERE'S PILAR,
AND THERE'S SOFIA.

29:54.026 --> 29:58.831
HOW MANY OTHERS ARE THERE?

29:58.831 --> 30:03.035
- EIGHT. OR NINE.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.503
SOFIA IS NEW.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.338
SHE HAS HER OWN ROOM.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.975
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
[knocks on door]

30:13.145 --> 30:15.882
- YOU'RE FREE NOW, ANNA.

30:15.882 --> 30:20.152
I TOLD YOU WE'D KEEP YOU SAFE.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.856
- SHE ONE OF THE PAPPASES?
- IT WAS A RANDOM OPERATION.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.926
NO ONE WOULD HAVE ANY REASON
TO THINK THAT WE'RE ON TO HIM.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.928
- ALL DUE RESPECT, DETECTIVE,
THEY'RE SMARTER THAN YOU ARE.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.163
WE PICKED UP A CONVERSATION
THIS MORNING.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.999
THE TERRORIST
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR,

30:32.999 --> 30:34.266
HE'S IN THE COUNTRY.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.902
WE MISSED HIM.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.336
- HEY, STUFF HAPPENS.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.337
- IF HE'D USED THE PAPERS
WE WERE LOOKING FOR,

30:38.337 --> 30:40.039
WE WOULD HAVE SPOTTED HIM.

30:40.039 --> 30:43.542
SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE GOT WIND
OF YOUR RANDOM OPERATION.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.278
- THIS GUY,
WHEN DID HE GET HERE EXACTLY?

30:46.278 --> 30:47.880
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.915
- SO HE COULD HAVE COME IN
WEEKS AGO.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.883
- YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THAT.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.385
I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS
TO MY BOSSES.

30:53.385 --> 30:56.622
AND YOURS.
[cell phone rings]

30:56.622 --> 31:00.626
HERE IT COMES.

31:03.963 --> 31:07.599
[door shuts]
- WHAT NOW?

31:07.599 --> 31:10.903
- MAYBE THEY KILLED HER, TOO.

31:10.903 --> 31:12.972
[sobbing]

31:16.042 --> 31:19.411
THEY SHOWED ME PICTURES
OF MY LITTLE SISTER BACK HOME.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.183
THEY SAID THEIR FRIENDS WOULD
TAKE HER

31:24.183 --> 31:27.053
IF I DIDN'T DO
EVERYTHING THEY SAY.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.427
- IF THEY WANT TO FIRE ME,
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.497
GO GET THESE SONS OF BITCHES.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.576
[dog barking]
- POLICE! SEARCH WARRANT!

31:50.576 --> 31:52.178
- OH!

31:52.178 --> 31:54.313
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
GET DOWN.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.585
- MOVE.
- CLEAR!

31:59.585 --> 32:02.989
- PILAR.
- NEED A HAND.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.157
- WHERE'S MIKEY?
WHERE'S YOUR SON?

32:05.157 --> 32:06.658
- SCREW YOU.

32:06.658 --> 32:10.262
- PILAR, WHERE'S MIKEY?

32:16.202 --> 32:20.172
- STAND UP.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.644
- PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.713
LET'S GO, COME ON.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.656
- LET'S GO.
IT'S OKAY.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.760
- IT'S OVER FOR YOU, JUNIOR.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.562
AFTER YOUR LITTLE PARADE
THROUGH THAT LIVING ROOM,

32:43.562 --> 32:45.064
AIN'T NOBODY SCARED OF YOU.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.066
- I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.
- YOU SHOULD.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.734
WE GOT YOU COLD

32:48.734 --> 32:50.502
ON I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY COUNTS OF RAPE.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.504
- THEIR WHORES.
CAN'T RAPE A WHORE.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.640
- YEAH? [pounds desk]
WELL, YOU CAN MURDER ONE.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.343
WE FOUND THE ABORTION DOCTOR
YOU TOOK VIKA TO.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.744
HE SAID THAT SHE RAN OUT ON HIM,

32:58.744 --> 33:01.380
THAT YOU RAN AFTER HER
SAYING YOU'D KILL HER.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.449
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.017
- IT'S AMAZING.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.753
YOU ARE AS STUPID
AS YOU LOOK.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.422
- THEY'RE ALL TALKING, LOU.

33:10.422 --> 33:13.359
THE GIRLS, YOUR SON.

33:13.359 --> 33:16.662
- GREAT WITNESSES.
HOOKERS AND A FAT MORON.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.265
- WE'LL BE SURE
TO TELL HIM YOU SAID SO.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.699
- HE TOLD ME HE WAS RUNNING
A NANNY SERVICE.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.734
- NANNIES.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.703
THOSE GIRLS LOOK
LIKE NANNIES TO YOU?

33:24.703 --> 33:26.772
- LISTEN, I DON'T EVEN LIVE
IN THAT HOUSE.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.140
I HAVE A CONDO
IN LONG BEACH.

33:28.140 --> 33:32.078
I JUST CAME BY TODAY
TO WATCH THE GAME.

33:32.078 --> 33:35.581
- YOUR DAD'S PUTTING IT ALL
ON YOU.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.183
- YOU'RE LYING.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.251
- YEAH?

33:39.251 --> 33:40.752
YOU THINK HE LOVES YOU?

33:40.752 --> 33:43.722
OR EVEN LIKES YOU?

33:43.722 --> 33:47.626
OR YOU THINK HE WON'T TOSS YOU
OVER TO SAVE HIS OWN SKIN?

33:47.626 --> 33:49.295
- YOU MESSED UP, MIKEY.

33:49.295 --> 33:52.098
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SCREW THE MERCHANDISE.

33:52.098 --> 33:55.701
AND YOU'RE DEFINITELY
NOT SUPPOSED TO KILL IT.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.704
- YOUR DAD CALLED YOU
A "FAT MORON."

33:58.704 --> 34:01.807
THAT RING A BELL?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.648
- WE FOUND LOU'S BOOKS.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.317
- RIGHT WHERE MIKEY SAID
THEY'D BE--

34:11.317 --> 34:14.353
IN A HOLE IN THE WALL
BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR.

34:14.353 --> 34:18.490
- "PILAR, ANNA, VIKA."

34:18.490 --> 34:20.792
EVERY DATE, WHAT THEY CHARGED,
WHAT THEY DID.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.795
- SOME OF THESE WOMEN DID
15 JOBS A NIGHT.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.831
AND THEY GROSSED THOUSANDS.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.433
- LOOK WHAT THEY MADE
FOR THEMSELVES.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.102
$30 FOR COSMETICS,
$20 FOR ENERGY DRINKS,

34:30.102 --> 34:31.703
AND AN UNDERWEAR ALLOWANCE.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.305
- GUYS, WE'RE MISSING SOMEBODY.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.707
THE GIRL WHO PICKED UP PILAR
AT THE HOSPITAL.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.709
PILAR CALLED HER SOFIA.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.679
- INDIAN-LOOKING GIRL?
- YEAH.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.248
- YEAH, I DROVE HER

34:42.248 --> 34:43.782
WHEN AMARO AND ROLLINS WERE
PLAYING TAXI COP.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.551
- THERE'S NO SOFIA IN HERE.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.818
SHE DIDN'T BOOK ANY DATES.

34:46.818 --> 34:47.853
- SHE HAD AT LEAST ONE.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.655
SHE WAS WITH A JOHN
THAT NIGHT.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.690
- IT'S NOT IN THE BOOK.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.392
- SHE AND THE JOHN
WEREN'T HAVING SEX.

34:53.392 --> 34:56.562
THEY WERE JUST TALKING.
- WHAT LANGUAGE?

34:56.562 --> 34:59.498
- SOMETHING FOREIGN.
I COULDN'T HEAR.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.334
- ANNA SAID SOFIA HAD
HER OWN ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

35:02.334 --> 35:05.371
AND SHE'S NEW.

35:05.371 --> 35:09.341
- THE INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS
ABOUT THE TERRORISM...

35:09.341 --> 35:11.577
DID THEY SAY IT WAS A HE?

35:15.514 --> 35:18.584
- I'LL CALL EAMES.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.858
- SOFIA?
WHO'S SOFIA?

35:26.858 --> 35:29.295
- WHERE IS SHE?
- BEATS ME.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.763
GETTING A BIKINI WAX.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.432
- LOU, WE KNOW

35:33.432 --> 35:35.901
THAT SHE WASN'T WORKING
FOR YOU AND MIKEY.

35:35.901 --> 35:39.271
SO WHAT WAS SHE DOING?

35:39.271 --> 35:41.707
- YOU WERE JUST BABYSITTING HER,
WEREN'T YOU?

35:41.707 --> 35:44.776
DID SOMEBODY PAY YOU
TO DO THAT?

35:44.776 --> 35:46.212
THEY TELL YOU WHAT
SHE WAS HERE FOR?

35:46.212 --> 35:50.316
- WHO'S SHE?

35:50.316 --> 35:51.583
WHAT'S THIS WORTH TO YOU?

35:51.583 --> 35:55.187
- DEPENDS WHAT YOU TELL US.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.422
- SO I CAN WALK OUT OF HERE?

35:56.422 --> 35:57.623
GO BACK TO LONG BEACH?

35:57.623 --> 35:59.691
CATCH THE END OF THE GAME?

35:59.691 --> 36:03.362
- GIVE US A TASTE.

36:05.931 --> 36:06.932
- OKAY.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.900
- SHE CAME IN TWO WEEKS AGO.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.270
BUT SHE WASN'T HERE TO HOOK.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.205
SHE WAS UP TO SOMETHING ELSE.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.774
- WHAT?

36:15.774 --> 36:18.277
- TELL US WHERE SHE IS.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.511
- KNOW WHAT?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.547
I MIGHT REMEMBER THAT...

36:21.547 --> 36:27.319
ONCE MY LAWYER WORKS OUT
A DEAL FOR ME.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.855
- THAT'S A HELL OF A COVER
FOR A TERRORIST.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.324
TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY
AS A SMUGGLED SEX SLAVE.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.725
WHO'D OF THOUGHT?

36:33.725 --> 36:35.861
- SURE, JUST ANOTHER WOMAN BEING
BOUGHT AND SOLD.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.496
NOBODY'S GONNA LOOK
TOO CAREFULLY AT THAT.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.265
- I'VE GOT TO CALL MY PEOPLE.
- AND THEN WHAT?

36:39.265 --> 36:42.301
THEY WHISK LOU AWAY
AND GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE WANTS?

36:42.301 --> 36:43.435
- TO PREVENT
A MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACK,

36:43.435 --> 36:44.836
YEAH, THEY WILL.

36:44.836 --> 36:45.971
- AFTER WHAT THEY DID
TO THOSE GIRLS?

36:45.971 --> 36:47.539
AFTER THEY BEAT ONE TO DEATH?

36:47.539 --> 36:50.276
LOOK, WHERE DID FIN PICK UP

36:50.276 --> 36:51.977
SOFIA'S JOHN,
AT A HOTEL?

36:51.977 --> 36:54.012
- NO, APARTMENT BUILDING.
AMSTERDAM AVE.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.282
- JUST GIVE US ONE CRACK
AT THIS

36:56.282 --> 36:58.284
BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT CALL.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.386
- YOU WANT TO GO AFTER
AN OPERATIONAL TERRORIST

37:00.386 --> 37:02.288
BY YOURSELVES?

37:02.288 --> 37:04.690
SVU TAKES ON AL-QAEDA?

37:04.690 --> 37:09.995
- YOU CAN COME WITH.

37:09.995 --> 37:13.299
- ALL RIGHT, SUPER SAYS
SHE'S IN THERE RIGHT NOW.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.000
USUALLY COMES AROUND 5:00
AND STAYS AN HOUR.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.704
- IT'S 6:11.

37:26.044 --> 37:30.916
- [gasps]
- DON'T YELL, OKAY?

37:32.851 --> 37:33.919
- WHO'S IN THERE?

37:33.919 --> 37:35.554
- [stammers]
A DATE.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.289
- HOW MANY ARE THEY,
AND WHAT WEAPONS DO THEY HAVE?

37:37.289 --> 37:39.758
- WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

37:39.758 --> 37:40.892
I'M JUST A WHORE.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.528
I WORK FOR LOU.

37:42.528 --> 37:46.298
DID YOU KNOW THAT TATTOOS
WERE FORBIDDEN IN ISLAM?

37:48.600 --> 37:52.037
HOW MANY?
WHAT WEAPONS?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.443
[kicks door,
door slams against wall]

37:57.443 --> 37:59.778
- DON'T MOVE!

37:59.778 --> 38:02.047
- NOT AN INCH!

38:02.047 --> 38:04.049
- THAT A BOY.

38:04.049 --> 38:07.319
- JUST KEEP STILL NOW.

38:09.921 --> 38:13.592
[grunting]

38:15.327 --> 38:19.765
[handcuffs ratchet]

38:19.765 --> 38:21.933
- I KEEP TELLING YOU,

38:21.933 --> 38:23.369
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BOMBS.

38:23.369 --> 38:24.703
I WAS JUST THERE TO HAVE SEX.

38:24.703 --> 38:28.474
- NO. SEE, SOFIA,
WE'RE WAY PAST THAT.

38:28.474 --> 38:31.543
WE CAN HAVE YOU EXAMINED,
AND WHEN WE DO,

38:31.543 --> 38:33.612
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
YOU'RE A VIRGIN.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.681
AREN'T WE?

38:35.681 --> 38:39.518
- HOW CAN A WHORE BE A VIRGIN?
- SHE CAN'T.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.789
MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL FOR YOU.

38:43.789 --> 38:47.526
LIVING IN THAT HOUSE.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.061
- I'M SURE YOU HAD
A GOOD REASON.

38:50.061 --> 38:54.466
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

38:54.466 --> 38:56.134
- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

38:56.134 --> 39:00.506
- NO, I DON'T.
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.073
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:02.073 --> 39:04.142
DID IT HAPPEN TO YOU?

39:04.142 --> 39:07.413
TO SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY?

39:13.985 --> 39:17.689
YOU'RE FROM WAZIRISTAN.

39:17.689 --> 39:21.393
WHAT VILLAGE?

39:24.129 --> 39:28.434
DON'T YOU THINK PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW?

39:31.603 --> 39:33.371
THEY CALL YOU A TERRORIST.

39:35.106 --> 39:39.010
DON'T YOU THINK
THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND?

39:39.010 --> 39:42.013
DON'T YOU WANT THEM...

39:42.013 --> 39:45.083
TO UNDERSTAND?

39:56.194 --> 39:59.465
- MY FATHER WAS A DOCTOR.

40:02.534 --> 40:06.037
A DRONE STRUCK SOME PEOPLE
NEAR WHERE WE LIVED.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.073
MY FATHER WENT TO HELP.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.976
TO TEND THE WOUNDED.

40:10.976 --> 40:14.145
HE WAS NOT A FIGHTER.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.948
HE WAS TRYING TO SAVE LIVES.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.785
STOP THE BLEEDING.

40:19.785 --> 40:22.788
AND THEN...

40:22.788 --> 40:26.024
ANOTHER DRONE HIT.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.860
YOUR GOVERNMENT TARGETS
THE RESCUERS.

40:28.860 --> 40:33.499
IT IS STANDARD...
POLICY.

40:35.033 --> 40:38.570
MY FATHER...

40:38.570 --> 40:41.707
HE WAS BLOWN INTO PIECES.

40:44.810 --> 40:48.113
WE BURIED THE ONES
WE COULD FIND.

40:50.582 --> 40:53.184
- SO YOU CAME HERE.

40:53.184 --> 40:56.454
- THIS IS WHERE
THE DRONES CAME FROM.

41:01.693 --> 41:05.697
- AND YOU HID AMONG GIRLS
THAT WERE BEING RAPED,

41:05.697 --> 41:10.101
WHO WERE ENSLAVED.

41:10.101 --> 41:14.139
AND YOU LET THAT HAPPEN.

41:18.109 --> 41:21.179
- I WAS SORRY FOR THEM.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.920
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE
TO BE SORRY FOR.

41:35.994 --> 41:40.599
- IT'S A ROUGH STORY
ABOUT THE FATHER.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.669
- THEY ALL HAVE A REASON.

41:43.669 --> 41:47.272
SOMETHING.

41:47.272 --> 41:51.176
- AND THAT'S HOW YOU BREAK 'EM.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.278
GET THEM TO TELL THEIR STORY.

41:53.278 --> 41:56.815
- ISN'T THAT HOW YOU DO IT?

41:56.815 --> 42:00.986
- WELL, I DON'T NORMALLY DO IT
LEANING OVER SIDEWAYS.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.221
- [laughing]
YEAH.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.323
UH...

42:05.323 --> 42:07.826
I LEARNED THAT FROM MY PARTNER
AT MAJOR CASE.

42:07.826 --> 42:13.231
IT WAS HIS WAY
OF KEEPING EYE CONTACT.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.701
- IT'S A LITTLE ECCENTRIC.

42:15.701 --> 42:18.103
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

42:18.103 --> 42:19.204
- OKAY.

42:19.204 --> 42:22.708
[laughter]

42:22.708 --> 42:25.877
- ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.846
THE TWO OF US.

42:27.846 --> 42:31.182
IT WAS LIKE WE WERE MARRIED.

42:33.919 --> 42:37.589
- BUT YOU WEREN'T.
