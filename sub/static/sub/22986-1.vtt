# We came to make it hotter #

01:43.725 --> 01:46.091
# We beat the party starters #

01:46.161 --> 01:48.129
# Bubblin' up just like lava #

01:48.196 --> 01:50.721
# Like lava,
heat it like a sauna #

01:50.799 --> 01:53.233
# Penetrate
into your body armor #

01:53.301 --> 01:55.462
# Rhythmically we massage ya #

01:55.537 --> 01:57.732
# With hip-hop mixed up
with samba #

01:57.806 --> 01:59.535
# With samba
So yes, yes, y'all #

01:59.607 --> 02:00.574
# Yes, y'all, y'all #

02:00.642 --> 02:01.768
# You know we never stop,
we never rest, y'all #

02:01.843 --> 02:02.810
# Rest, y'all, y'all #

02:02.877 --> 02:04.276
# We can keep it
funky fresh, y'all #

02:04.345 --> 02:05.369
# Fresh, y'all, y'all #

02:05.447 --> 02:07.210

# But Tab rocked ryhmes #

02:20.962 --> 02:22.431
- # On one two, three,
four, several times #

02:22.432 --> 02:22.953
- Oh, Miss. Miss.

02:23.031 --> 02:25.158
We have a lot
of vegetarians...

02:25.233 --> 02:27.827
so I wanna make sure every tray
has a vegetarian item...

02:27.902 --> 02:29.927
and a non-vegetarian item.
Got it?

02:30.004 --> 02:31.801
And they can't touch. Okay?

02:31.873 --> 02:33.738
And if you run out of either,
go back and refill.

02:33.808 --> 02:35.776
Don't just circulate with one.
Got it?

02:35.844 --> 02:37.471
And if you get the feeling
one is running out faster...

02:37.545 --> 02:39.012
than the other,
then just load the trays...

02:39.080 --> 02:40.047
according to that ratio.

02:40.114 --> 02:41.081
You got it?

02:41.149 --> 02:42.116
Okay, what else?

02:42.183 --> 02:43.150
- Hey!
- Um... Ooh!

02:43.218 --> 02:45.277
It's your wedding day. Relax.

02:45.353 --> 02:46.786
Hey.

02:46.855 --> 02:49.187
I find a little stress
goes a long way.

02:49.257 --> 02:52.283
If I worry now, then
I can relax during the ceremony.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.692
You're not gonna relax
during the ceremony.

02:54.762 --> 02:56.161
You're right.

02:56.231 --> 02:57.220
You should, though.

02:57.298 --> 02:58.322
It's gonna be perfect.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.767
It's really coming together,
isn't it?

03:01.669 --> 03:04.297
You know,
I think we should probab...

03:04.372 --> 03:05.669
What in the heck?

03:07.041 --> 03:08.406
Well, hello, little lady.

03:08.476 --> 03:10.341
What can I do for you?

03:10.411 --> 03:11.708
What the hell is this?

03:11.779 --> 03:13.178
Why, it's the angel...

03:13.248 --> 03:14.840
just like your ordered.

03:14.916 --> 03:17.384
No, but she doesn't have wings.

03:17.452 --> 03:19.147
Yeah. So?

03:19.220 --> 03:21.552
So angels have wings.

03:21.623 --> 03:23.215
This is just a lady.

03:23.291 --> 03:26.158
No. No, no, no.
It's... It's an angel.

03:26.227 --> 03:28.923
See, beautiful,
all-knowing smile...

03:28.997 --> 03:33.127
eyes that have seen
a thousand eternities... angel.

03:34.269 --> 03:37.432
Chloe, do angels have wings?

03:38.172 --> 03:39.139
Sometimes?

03:39.207 --> 03:40.174
Always!

03:40.241 --> 03:43.677
That's the difference between
a person and an angel: wings.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.440
Why do angels
have to have wings?

03:45.513 --> 03:46.946
So they can fly.

03:47.015 --> 03:48.607
No, but angels are magical.

03:48.683 --> 03:50.241
They don't need wings to fly.

03:50.318 --> 03:51.808
What, does God have wings?

03:51.886 --> 03:55.378
Okay, I'm not gonna stand here
and debate theology with you.

03:55.456 --> 03:58.289
So just take it back
and bring me one with wings.

03:58.359 --> 04:00.520
All right, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, little miss.

04:00.595 --> 04:02.256
This is a ice sculpture.

04:02.330 --> 04:05.265
I sculpted it out of ice,
then it melts...

04:05.333 --> 04:07.597
and I don't have a lot of them
just lyin' around.

04:07.669 --> 04:10.160
So sculpt some wings
and stick them on. I don't care.

04:10.238 --> 04:12.103
This isn't what I ordered,
and I'm not accepting it.

04:12.173 --> 04:14.198
- Yeah. But I...
- Tut-tut-tut, take it back.

04:16.077 --> 04:17.772
I made an angel.

04:18.346 --> 04:19.438
Oh, yoo-hoo.

04:19.514 --> 04:20.947
Oh, not done with you.

04:21.015 --> 04:22.243
Not so fast.

04:22.317 --> 04:23.944
Um, did you get
the appetizers down?

04:24.018 --> 04:25.212
Do I need
to go through it again?

04:25.286 --> 04:26.480
No.

04:26.554 --> 04:28.784
Are you nodding to signal yes,
or is your neck broken?

04:28.856 --> 04:30.653
Oh, yes, appetizers. Yes.

04:30.725 --> 04:31.885
Dinner.

04:31.960 --> 04:32.949
I want this on a schedule.

04:33.027 --> 04:34.392
So I want you to get
the salads down...

04:34.462 --> 04:37.625
even if the people aren't...
My gardenias!

04:37.699 --> 04:38.666
Your what?

04:38.733 --> 04:39.961
- Stop! You're gonna run over...
- Doesn't seem to be a reason...

04:40.034 --> 04:41.626
- my gardenias!
- why we didn't do that.

04:41.703 --> 04:44.001
You idiot! Stop your truck!

04:44.072 --> 04:45.664
I'm just doing what
I'm supposed to be doing. I...

04:45.740 --> 04:47.002
- Stop the truck!
- Huh?

04:47.075 --> 04:48.099
Stop!

04:48.176 --> 04:50.235
- What are you talkin' about?
- Stop the truck!

04:50.311 --> 04:51.972
- Stop!
- Oh!

04:55.316 --> 04:56.340
Huh?

05:15.103 --> 05:16.070
Who the hell are you?

05:16.137 --> 05:17.900
Kate, I know this must be...

05:17.972 --> 05:19.439
That idiot with the truck!

05:19.507 --> 05:20.565
I'm gonna kill him.

05:20.642 --> 05:22.109
I'm gonna sue him,
and then I'm gonna kill him!

05:22.176 --> 05:23.143
What time is it?

05:23.211 --> 05:24.542
That's not really important
right now.

05:24.612 --> 05:25.601
Don't tell me what's important.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.669
I'm getting married today.

05:26.748 --> 05:28.010
No, you're not.

05:28.082 --> 05:29.572
How long
have I been unconscious?

05:29.651 --> 05:30.845
- What kind of hospital is this?
- Will you please stop...

05:30.918 --> 05:32.442
interrupting and just listen.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.987
Look, my insurance pays
your salary...

05:34.055 --> 05:36.250
so if I want some information,
just do me the courtesy...

05:36.324 --> 05:37.586
Will you shut up? You're dead!

05:40.028 --> 05:41.461
Is that some kind of sick joke?

05:41.529 --> 05:42.860
Look around you.
There are no walls.

05:42.930 --> 05:43.954
Hello?
Where do you think you are?

05:44.032 --> 05:45.090
Okay, you were crushed to death.

05:46.501 --> 05:48.059
I'm sorry. I lost my cool.

05:48.136 --> 05:49.433
I don't usually do that.

05:49.937 --> 05:50.904
I'm dead?

05:50.972 --> 05:52.200
I'm sorry.

05:52.273 --> 05:53.501
Now, we don't have much time.

05:53.574 --> 05:55.007
- Is this heaven?
- Not exactly.

05:55.076 --> 05:57.067
- Hell?
- No. Just listen, please.

05:57.145 --> 05:58.612
There are some important things
for you to know.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.170
Well, who are you?

06:00.248 --> 06:01.738
I'm an angel.

06:07.255 --> 06:08.552
Who put you up to this?

06:08.623 --> 06:09.590
Put me up to what?

06:09.657 --> 06:12.023
For the last damn time,
angels have wings.

06:12.093 --> 06:13.492
Wings!

06:14.829 --> 06:16.194
Oh, my God, you're disappearing.

06:16.264 --> 06:17.595
That's not good. I'm sorry.

06:17.665 --> 06:20.998
You were saying something
about important information?

06:21.069 --> 06:22.559
Wait! Don't go!

06:22.637 --> 06:24.400
Hello?

06:24.472 --> 06:25.734
Hello?!

06:29.944 --> 06:31.002
Crap!

06:32.714 --> 06:34.477
It's coming in clearer now.

06:35.416 --> 06:38.112
Definitely, coming in clearer.

06:41.355 --> 06:42.379
A boat.

06:43.891 --> 06:45.882
He left the money on your boat.

06:47.095 --> 06:49.063
We didn't have a boat.

06:49.130 --> 06:50.154
No boat?

06:56.404 --> 06:57.428
Hold on.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.668
I'm getting something.

07:03.711 --> 07:05.440
- You're sure you didn't have a boat?
- No boat.

07:05.513 --> 07:06.673
Maybe he had a boat
that you didn't know about.

07:06.748 --> 07:07.976
He was afraid of the water.

07:08.049 --> 07:09.346
A boot?

07:11.119 --> 07:12.143
Probably not?

07:13.488 --> 07:15.251
Let me see
if something else comes in.

07:16.724 --> 07:17.713
Do you hear that, too?

07:17.792 --> 07:18.952
Yeah, I do.

07:19.026 --> 07:20.653
Is it from beyond?
Is that a message?

07:20.728 --> 07:22.628
No. I think it's my smoke alarm.

07:22.697 --> 07:24.062
Can you excuse me a second,
Mary?

07:25.767 --> 07:27.530
Oh, God! Oh, no!

07:27.602 --> 07:29.069
Oh, no!

07:29.137 --> 07:30.104
What, what, what?

07:30.171 --> 07:31.433
- What is it?
- Uh, no, everything's fine.

07:31.506 --> 07:32.473
No, no, no.
It's under control.

07:32.540 --> 07:33.507
- It's just a little, uh...
- What is that?

07:33.574 --> 07:34.541
Just a little smoky, that's all.

07:34.609 --> 07:35.115
Oh, God. Move.

07:35.116 --> 07:36.600
It's the thing in that
silver pan that burned.

07:36.677 --> 07:37.644
The osso bucco.

07:37.712 --> 07:39.179
I-I-I don't know.
Does the name matter?

07:39.247 --> 07:40.305
It's on fire.

07:40.381 --> 07:42.212
God, Dan,
you're like the worst cook ever.

07:42.283 --> 07:43.511
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Get the crab

07:43.584 --> 07:44.551
What are you...
Can you...

07:44.619 --> 07:45.586
I'm just... It's smoking.

07:45.653 --> 07:46.620
Can you...
Well, how's the crab dip going?

07:46.687 --> 07:48.086
Crab dip is going great.
Oh, no, no.

07:48.156 --> 07:50.522
The crab dip is going
spectacularly well.

07:50.591 --> 07:51.888
That's the thing
in the little red bowl, right?

07:51.959 --> 07:53.241
Yes. Can you just
chop something, please?

07:53.242 --> 07:53.824
Chopping, chopping.

07:54.729 --> 07:56.356
Oh, God, Dan.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.266
You know, as much as
I love you hovering around...

08:04.338 --> 08:06.397
and watching me while I work,
how's the reading going?

08:06.474 --> 08:08.408
- Oh, the reading. The reading.
- Okay.

08:09.610 --> 08:10.634
I'm back.

08:10.711 --> 08:12.178
Listen, I gotta run.

08:12.246 --> 08:13.213
Oh, really?

08:13.281 --> 08:14.373
Sorry about that, Mary.

08:14.448 --> 08:16.143
- I just...
- Oh, no. You did good.

08:16.217 --> 08:17.548
- Really?
- Absolutely.

08:17.618 --> 08:19.108
Maybe we have a boat
I forgot about.

08:19.187 --> 08:20.381
- Yeah. I mean, you know...
- Yeah.

08:20.454 --> 08:21.716
And remember, no...

08:21.789 --> 08:23.518
- driving on Mondays.
- Driving on Mondays.

08:23.591 --> 08:25.582
Right? Be careful.

08:25.660 --> 08:26.684
Bye.

08:28.162 --> 08:29.129
Okay, Dan.

08:29.197 --> 08:30.186
Why aren't you chopping?

08:30.264 --> 08:31.629
Hmm? Oh, small cut.

08:31.699 --> 08:32.961
- What?
- It's fine. It's tiny. It's all good.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.126
- Really?
- Yeah. And most of the blood...

08:34.202 --> 08:36.102
went into the tomato sauce,
so who's gonna know?

08:36.169 --> 08:38.866
Dan, look, I'm sorry
for leaving you alone.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.100
It's so unfair.

08:40.174 --> 08:42.472
You have my complete,
undivided attention now, okay?

08:46.781 --> 08:48.874
Stir the béarnaise sauce
before it separates, all right?

08:48.950 --> 08:50.042
You got it. Oh, béarnaise...

08:50.117 --> 08:51.141
No, actually,
I know what that one is.

08:51.219 --> 08:52.743
- Good.
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

08:58.226 --> 08:59.250
Damn it.

09:00.695 --> 09:01.662
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:01.729 --> 09:03.492
I'm Chloe.
I'm a friend of Beth's.

09:03.564 --> 09:05.464
She gave me your address
and told me to stop by.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.797
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

09:07.869 --> 09:08.893
Beth. God, how is she?

09:08.970 --> 09:10.597
Ah, you know,
still with the drummer.

09:10.671 --> 09:12.138
You are kidding me.
That guy is a mess.

09:12.206 --> 09:13.434
I thought they totally broke up.

09:13.507 --> 09:15.372
Which time? I think, it's
been like five times already.

09:15.443 --> 09:17.138
Do you know that girl Colleen,
who he used to date?

09:17.211 --> 09:18.371
- Do you know Colleen?
- Yeah.

09:18.446 --> 09:19.936
- Have we met before?
- You look really familiar.

09:20.014 --> 09:21.345
That's so weird, 'cause
when you opened the door...

09:21.415 --> 09:22.712
- I was like, "I think I know that girl."
- Yeah.

09:22.783 --> 09:23.750
That's so funny.

09:23.818 --> 09:25.251
Oh, man.

09:25.319 --> 09:26.946
Uh... sorry.

09:27.021 --> 09:28.215
This is my brother, Henry.

09:28.289 --> 09:29.256
Hi.

09:29.323 --> 09:30.290
He needs your help.

09:30.358 --> 09:31.848
I don't know about that.

09:31.926 --> 09:33.086
You promised.

09:33.761 --> 09:35.228
Well, come on in.

09:37.965 --> 09:39.728
Wow. God, Beth.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.290
Haven't heard her name...

09:41.369 --> 09:42.427
long time.

09:42.503 --> 09:44.733
Um, how can I help you?

09:47.174 --> 09:48.436
I don't know if you can.

09:49.377 --> 09:52.244
Henry's fiancée passed away
about a year ago...

09:52.313 --> 09:54.281
on their wedding day.

09:54.348 --> 09:56.145
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

09:56.217 --> 09:57.343
Thank you.

09:57.418 --> 09:58.783
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but how, um...

09:58.853 --> 09:59.877
How did it happen?

10:00.988 --> 10:02.546
She was crushed by an angel...

10:03.658 --> 10:06.149
and as sad as I am,
I do appreciate the irony.

10:07.361 --> 10:09.295
And, well, he's just...

10:09.363 --> 10:10.762
He's not moving on.

10:10.831 --> 10:12.230
I don't think that's so unusual.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.494
You've changed.

10:13.567 --> 10:14.795
You don't smile.

10:14.869 --> 10:16.769
You don't leave your apartment.

10:16.837 --> 10:17.929
I like my apartment.

10:18.005 --> 10:19.836
Nobody hassles me
if I don't smile there.

10:20.508 --> 10:22.442
He's not letting go,
and I was just thinking...

10:22.510 --> 10:26.207
that maybe if he communicated
with his fiancée, Kate...

10:26.280 --> 10:28.908
that, um, maybe she would,
you know...

10:28.983 --> 10:31.679
convince him that it's okay
for him to move on in his life.

10:32.820 --> 10:33.946
Is that what you want?

10:34.021 --> 10:35.420
That's what she wants.

10:35.489 --> 10:36.786
And once she gets an idea
in her head...

10:36.857 --> 10:38.290
it's best to just...

10:38.359 --> 10:40.884
I'm here, so, you know.

10:42.029 --> 10:44.293
Okay. All right.

10:44.365 --> 10:46.128
Well, let's give it a shot.

10:47.501 --> 10:50.527
Um, how do you get
into all of this?

10:50.604 --> 10:51.696
Oh, what?
You mean, like being a psychic?

10:51.772 --> 10:52.739
Yeah.

10:52.807 --> 10:54.035
Why? You think it's crap?

10:54.775 --> 10:56.003
No. I keep an open mind.

10:56.077 --> 10:58.136
I mean, there are plenty
of things people can't explain.

10:58.212 --> 10:59.338
You can be honest.

11:00.214 --> 11:02.478
Not crap, just unproven...

11:03.384 --> 11:06.012
after hundreds of years
and thousands of studies.

11:07.355 --> 11:08.583
But you're keeping an open mind.

11:08.656 --> 11:09.680
Isn't it obvious?

11:12.093 --> 11:13.651
Well, what do you do
for a living?

11:13.728 --> 11:16.219
- I'm a vet.
- So a man of science?

11:16.297 --> 11:17.958
I suppose I am.

11:18.032 --> 11:19.158
Do you believe in heaven?

11:20.001 --> 11:21.195
Jury's out.

11:21.869 --> 11:23.302
Wow.

11:23.371 --> 11:25.771
See, that's just...
That's depressing to me.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.899
I mean, what a sad and
hopeless world it would be...

11:27.975 --> 11:29.602
if that was the case.

11:29.677 --> 11:32.737
I really believe that the people
we love never really leave us.

11:32.813 --> 11:35.338
You know, they're...
They're always watchin' over us.

11:35.983 --> 11:38.543
And then, sometimes,
if we're lucky...

11:38.619 --> 11:40.177
we get to talk to them.

11:42.490 --> 11:43.616
So have you had
a lot of luck with this?

11:43.691 --> 11:45.056
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

11:45.126 --> 11:46.354
I know that's
not very scientific...

11:46.427 --> 11:47.416
but when it works...

11:47.495 --> 11:49.224
it really does
make people happy.

11:52.433 --> 11:53.491
You wanna give it a go?

11:55.970 --> 11:57.369
Okay. Give me your hands.

11:58.339 --> 11:59.704
Does this cost extra?

11:59.774 --> 12:02.675
Do you always use humor to cope
with uncomfortable situations?

12:02.743 --> 12:05.234
That reminds of this time
two rabbis walked into a bar.

12:05.312 --> 12:07.837
All right.
Come on, give me your hands.

12:09.884 --> 12:12.284
Now, just think about the person
you're trying to contact.

12:13.621 --> 12:15.885
I am getting something, um,
but it's...

12:15.956 --> 12:16.980
But it's a man.

12:17.825 --> 12:21.784
He's in a, like, a blue suit
or, um, like a uniform.

12:21.862 --> 12:23.989
My father wore blue suits.

12:24.065 --> 12:25.032
He was a lawyer.

12:25.099 --> 12:26.464
Are you trying to contact him?

12:27.435 --> 12:29.300
No. He's still alive.

12:29.370 --> 12:31.133
- Retired.
- Oh.

12:31.205 --> 12:32.502
At least,
I think he's still alive.

12:32.573 --> 12:34.336
I haven't spoken with him
since last night.

12:34.408 --> 12:35.534
Maybe something happened
this morning.

12:35.609 --> 12:37.042
All right. Look, I get it.

12:37.111 --> 12:38.772
You don't believe in this stuff,
and you probably think...

12:38.846 --> 12:41.007
I'm some loon
who's just wasting your time.

12:41.082 --> 12:43.983
But you know what?
You're here, so why not?

12:44.051 --> 12:46.315
All I'm asking for is five
minutes for you to humor me.

12:48.889 --> 12:50.015
You're right. I'm sorry.

12:50.091 --> 12:51.149
Okay.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.058
Just relax. Give it a go.

12:58.566 --> 13:00.761
Okay. Just think about Kate.

13:00.835 --> 13:04.362
Picture her in your mind:
the way she made you feel...

13:04.438 --> 13:05.803
the way she looked.

13:05.873 --> 13:07.670
Think about Kate.

13:19.687 --> 13:21.712
- Oh, God.
- That didn't sound good.

13:21.789 --> 13:24.849
My assistant. Probably
just shish-kebabbed his tongue.

13:32.766 --> 13:34.131
Oh, God!

13:35.336 --> 13:36.530
Whoa! Oh!

13:37.238 --> 13:38.796
Holy shit!

13:44.078 --> 13:46.546
Um, you know,
I-I should get going.

13:46.614 --> 13:47.740
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:47.815 --> 13:49.749
- I wanna check on my dad.
- Oh.

13:54.088 --> 13:55.055
What do I owe you?

13:55.122 --> 13:56.089
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

13:56.157 --> 13:59.388
Oh, no. But I...
I mean...

13:59.460 --> 14:00.518
No, no, no. I-I didn't...

14:00.594 --> 14:01.652
I didn't get anything, so...

14:01.729 --> 14:02.696
Yeah, but you tried.

14:02.763 --> 14:04.492
If someone's pet dies
on the operating table...

14:04.565 --> 14:05.827
you don't charge them, right?
I mean...

14:07.434 --> 14:10.528
No. No, that...
That would make me a dick.

14:11.605 --> 14:13.573
Right.
It's a good thing you don't.

14:13.641 --> 14:16.474
Right. Yes, okay.

14:16.544 --> 14:19.138
If I ever need any catering,
I'll know where to come.

14:19.213 --> 14:20.305
I work cheap, so...

14:20.381 --> 14:22.042
I can see you
why you have two jobs.

14:22.116 --> 14:23.515
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you, Ashley.

14:23.584 --> 14:25.449
Oh. Nice to meet you.

14:27.922 --> 14:30.857
Say, "Pretty. Pretty bird."

14:30.925 --> 14:32.449
Come on, say it.

14:32.526 --> 14:35.256
You know, I gave you a key
in case of emergencies.

14:35.329 --> 14:36.318
I think you and I just have...

14:36.397 --> 14:38.558
a different definition
of "emergency."

14:38.632 --> 14:41.157
So, how'd it go with Ashley?

14:41.235 --> 14:44.432
Oh, that. Much to my surprise,
it was futile.

14:44.505 --> 14:45.597
You didn't try.

14:45.673 --> 14:46.935
I totally tried.

14:47.007 --> 14:49.737
I chanted, you know, I played
with an eagle feather...

14:49.810 --> 14:51.300
listened to some Tori Amos.

14:52.146 --> 14:53.113
And nothing?

14:53.180 --> 14:55.114
I mean, she's really nice,
but, I mean...

14:55.182 --> 14:56.615
the whole thing
was kind of a joke.

14:56.684 --> 14:59.175
Well, does she want you
to come back?

14:59.253 --> 15:00.550
Chloe, enough, all right?

15:02.323 --> 15:03.415
Right. You know what?

15:04.525 --> 15:06.720
I'm never gonna help you again.

15:06.794 --> 15:08.056
Is that a promise?

15:08.128 --> 15:10.756
Well, unless it's an emergency.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.364
Hey, you never told me
how it went on Friday.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.994
Oh, what,
with the stockbroker?

15:17.071 --> 15:19.164
What is it about telling a guy
that you're a psychic...

15:19.240 --> 15:20.537
that makes him think
that you'll sleep with him...

15:20.608 --> 15:22.132
on the first date?

15:22.209 --> 15:24.643
Well, maybe they think that,
because you're a psychic...

15:24.712 --> 15:25.974
you already know
that's all they're after...

15:26.046 --> 15:27.741
so they might
as well just go for it.

15:27.815 --> 15:30.784
That is so your gay prejudice
towards straight men talking.

15:30.851 --> 15:32.978
No, no, it's all men.

15:33.053 --> 15:35.647
Gay, straight, we're a real
goal-oriented gender...

15:35.723 --> 15:36.690
when it comes to sex.

15:36.757 --> 15:39.351
Dan, I think they're a little
more complicated than that.

15:39.426 --> 15:41.291
No, we're not.

15:41.362 --> 15:42.420
How's my ass look in this?

15:42.496 --> 15:44.088
I don't know.
Can you get a little closer?

15:44.164 --> 15:46.132
I still have
some peripheral vision left.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.828
# Hey now now,
we're goin' down down #

15:48.902 --> 15:50.460
# And we ride the bus there #

15:50.537 --> 15:52.061
# Pay the bus fare #

15:52.139 --> 15:54.039
# Or we find a new reason #

15:54.108 --> 15:55.268
# A new way of livin' #

15:55.342 --> 15:57.936
# And we shout it out,
and try to... #

15:58.012 --> 15:59.570
Good God, what the hell is that?

15:59.647 --> 16:02.639
Oh, Dr. Mills,
you know this is Beatrice.

16:02.716 --> 16:03.944
Lona, there are other ways
you can show your love...

16:04.018 --> 16:06.043
for Beatrice
besides giving her food.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.145
Take her for a walk,
throw her a Frisbee.

16:08.222 --> 16:10.019
She's gained a little weight,
I know.

16:10.090 --> 16:12.081
I've driven cars
smaller than her.

16:12.159 --> 16:14.354
She looks like a tick.

16:14.428 --> 16:16.828
The prettiest tick
you've ever seen.

16:16.897 --> 16:18.194
Well, let me grab
a couple of Sherpas.

16:18.265 --> 16:20.290
They can help me hoist her
on the table.

16:20.367 --> 16:23.200
Hey, guys, Beatrice is here.

16:23.270 --> 16:25.431
Aw! I call head.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.497
No, I'm not taking the ass
two times in a row.

16:27.574 --> 16:28.939
- Shoot you for it.
- And you...

16:29.009 --> 16:30.476
quit messin' with
whatever you're messing with.

16:30.544 --> 16:32.944
I'm not messing with anything.

16:33.013 --> 16:34.776
I make such a cute doctor.

16:34.848 --> 16:36.281
I should've stayed in college.

16:37.251 --> 16:38.411
These aren't toys.

16:38.485 --> 16:40.112
Oh, hey, just curious...

16:40.187 --> 16:42.951
do animal tranquilizers work
on people?

16:43.023 --> 16:44.354
How'd you get those
out of my cabinet?

16:46.160 --> 16:47.593
Here we go.

16:48.629 --> 16:49.687
Is that it,
or can I go back to, uh...

16:49.763 --> 16:50.889
Go ahead.

16:50.964 --> 16:53.660
Oh, hello,
the reason why I came here.

16:53.734 --> 16:56.635
Um, I've got somebody
I want you to meet.

16:56.704 --> 16:57.671
- Now hoist.
- Oh, God.

16:57.738 --> 16:59.501
Her name is Janet.

16:59.573 --> 17:01.165
- Okay.
- Janet.

17:01.241 --> 17:03.334
I can already tell
I won't like her.

17:03.410 --> 17:05.207
She sounds like somebody
with a dream catcher.

17:05.279 --> 17:06.906
So, what,
are you never gonna date again?

17:07.915 --> 17:09.973
I'll date when the right person
comes along.

17:10.050 --> 17:11.676
Okay, well,
what if I told you...

17:11.752 --> 17:14.846
she's an eighteen-year-old,
hot masseuse...

17:14.922 --> 17:18.153
with huge natural breasts,
who loves to gourmet cook...

17:18.224 --> 17:20.489
watch sports,
perform oral sex...

17:20.560 --> 17:23.894
and when she's not doing
any of that, she saves whales.

17:25.299 --> 17:27.267
I guess we could have lunch.

17:27.334 --> 17:28.460
Okay.

17:28.535 --> 17:30.400
What if she doesn't do
any of those things?

17:30.471 --> 17:31.665
Goodbye, Chloe.

17:31.739 --> 17:33.764
Tell me when you wanna start
dating again, okay?

17:33.841 --> 17:35.706
Two years, five years, what?

17:35.776 --> 17:37.038
I had the person I was gonna
spend my life with...

17:37.111 --> 17:38.078
and I lost her.

17:38.145 --> 17:41.512
So you're just gonna spend
the rest of your life alone?

17:41.582 --> 17:43.072
No, I've got you.
I've got my work.

17:43.150 --> 17:44.276
I'm sure
you're gonna get married...

17:44.351 --> 17:47.286
and have kids or adopt
a slew of Nigerian children...

17:47.354 --> 17:48.753
and I'm gonna get
to be Uncle Henry.

17:48.822 --> 17:49.948
Um...

17:51.125 --> 17:52.717
- Man down!
- There's a man down.

17:52.793 --> 17:54.192
All right, I've got to get...

17:56.864 --> 17:57.922
Why would you even want these?

17:57.998 --> 18:00.023
They're just cool.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.829
They're so big.

18:03.737 --> 18:05.170
I can't move my legs.

18:05.239 --> 18:06.365
Oh!

18:13.280 --> 18:14.645
I'm so sorry to bother you.

18:14.715 --> 18:17.582
I was wondering if you would
maybe try again with Henry.

18:17.651 --> 18:18.982
I mean, he really liked you...

18:19.052 --> 18:20.644
and if
he's ever gonna believe...

18:20.721 --> 18:23.315
that anyone is talking to Kate,
then I think it's gonna be you.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.051
Yeah, I mean,
I think that's a great idea.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.821
I just... I don't know
if he'll go for it.

18:27.895 --> 18:29.726
I don't think
he would come to you...

18:29.797 --> 18:31.958
but if you would go to him...

18:32.032 --> 18:34.227
and you could prove
that you heard from Kate...

18:35.469 --> 18:36.595
But I didn't.

18:36.670 --> 18:38.297
- You could fake it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:38.372 --> 18:39.566
I can't do that...

18:39.640 --> 18:42.302
'cause I'm not like a,
you know, scam artist.

18:42.376 --> 18:43.968
This is Kate's diary.
I, um...

18:44.044 --> 18:45.636
I went into Henry's apartment
when he wasn't there...

18:45.712 --> 18:47.145
you know, looking for letters
or anything...

18:47.214 --> 18:48.272
that would have information...

18:48.348 --> 18:50.111
that only the two of them
would know, and, I mean...

18:50.184 --> 18:51.617
Henry doesn't even know
this exists.

18:51.685 --> 18:52.947
Right. I just... I really...

18:53.020 --> 18:54.647
Look, I know that you've heard
the story before...

18:54.721 --> 18:56.450
but would you really think
about it?

18:56.523 --> 18:58.923
Do you really think that Henry's
better off sitting alone...

18:58.992 --> 19:00.789
in his apartment
for the rest of his life?

19:00.861 --> 19:02.055
Do you really think
that Kate's ghost...

19:02.129 --> 19:03.528
doesn't want him to date again?

19:03.597 --> 19:07.226
I'm just asking you to tell
one little lie...

19:07.301 --> 19:08.768
to salvage someone's life.

19:08.836 --> 19:10.633
Is that so impossible?

19:17.778 --> 19:20.508
Hey. Ashley, right?

19:20.581 --> 19:22.014
- Yeah.
- Henry.

19:22.082 --> 19:23.549
Henry. Hi.

19:23.617 --> 19:24.948
- How are you?
- Yeah, good, good.

19:25.018 --> 19:26.110
You shop here?

19:26.186 --> 19:27.949
Yeah, they, uh... They have
really great tomatoes here...

19:28.021 --> 19:32.458
so I just...
Oh, I see. Okay.

19:32.526 --> 19:35.984
Uh, tomatoes are vegetables
that you buy fresh...

19:36.063 --> 19:37.758
and then you cook them in food.

19:37.831 --> 19:39.298
I've heard about these, yeah.

19:39.366 --> 19:41.061
I always wondered what was
on this side of the store.

19:41.134 --> 19:42.999
- So colorful.
- Yeah.

19:43.070 --> 19:44.503
How's business?

19:44.571 --> 19:45.833
Oh, you know, sucks.

19:45.906 --> 19:48.431
- So it's looking up.
- Look up, right.

19:49.476 --> 19:50.670
Well, you know,
I'll let you go...

19:50.744 --> 19:52.211
but, uh, if you're
ever in the area...

19:52.279 --> 19:53.803
you should stop by,
and I'll cook you a...

19:53.881 --> 19:55.314
I'll cook you a real meal.

19:55.382 --> 19:56.644
All right.
Well, maybe I'll do that.

19:56.717 --> 19:57.706
- Okay.
- Nice seeing you.

19:57.784 --> 19:58.842
Nice seeing you.

20:03.790 --> 20:05.052
It was raining.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.092
It was raining
when you met her...

20:06.159 --> 20:07.285
the woman you were trying
to contact.

20:07.361 --> 20:10.728
It was nighttime,
and it was raining.

20:10.797 --> 20:12.230
You tried to steal her cab?

20:13.166 --> 20:14.133
Yeah.

20:14.201 --> 20:16.396
And you two...
You two got into a fight...

20:16.470 --> 20:18.131
but you rode with her
all the way home...

20:18.205 --> 20:20.435
even though you lived
in totally opposite directions.

20:20.507 --> 20:22.441
That's exactly what happened.

20:22.509 --> 20:23.669
And she stiffed me.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.905
I wound up paying eighty bucks
for that cab ride.

20:27.314 --> 20:29.111
Do you wanna go somewhere else,
so we can talk?

20:31.151 --> 20:32.175
Yeah, it's...

20:33.754 --> 20:34.778
Yeah.

20:37.324 --> 20:39.224
So I noticed you didn't have
any animals in your apartment.

20:39.293 --> 20:41.523
Oh, well, my building
doesn't allow pets...

20:41.595 --> 20:43.153
but I always grew up with cats.

20:43.230 --> 20:44.424
Oh.

20:45.632 --> 20:46.792
When I get a new a place,
I think I might...

20:46.867 --> 20:48.266
Wait. Why'd you go, "Oh"?

20:48.335 --> 20:50.394
"Oh, you had cats.
That's nice."

20:50.470 --> 20:53.496
No, that was more like,
"Ah, you had cats. Figures."

20:53.574 --> 20:54.768
I'm a vet. I love cats.

20:54.841 --> 20:56.775
Right.
And the women who have them?

20:57.711 --> 20:59.702
They're insane,
across the board.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.042
You know, they wear,
like, sweatshirts...

21:01.114 --> 21:02.342
- with their cat on them.
- Oh.

21:02.416 --> 21:04.407
You know, "Hang in there."

21:04.484 --> 21:06.884
Hey, look,
let me ask you, when...

21:06.954 --> 21:10.822
In the market,
were you, like...

21:10.891 --> 21:12.415
Were you hearing someone?

21:12.492 --> 21:14.460
Um, yeah, I mean, I think...
I think so.

21:14.528 --> 21:16.553
I think it was Kate.

21:16.630 --> 21:18.757
Seems a little hard to believe.

21:18.832 --> 21:21.198
I know,
but do you wanna try again?

21:23.804 --> 21:25.237
What do you got to lose?

21:27.474 --> 21:28.441
All right.

21:28.508 --> 21:30.908
Let me just get
your hand, like... Okay.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.170
This restaurant
reminds her of something.

21:36.350 --> 21:38.375
New York. It was snowing.

21:39.853 --> 21:42.481
We went...
We went there for Christmas.

21:42.556 --> 21:44.524
You refused to admit
that you didn't speak French...

21:45.492 --> 21:47.289
so you ordered the pancreas?

21:48.729 --> 21:51.721
And then, later,
after you threw up all...

21:55.636 --> 21:57.365
Hello. No, yeah.

21:57.437 --> 21:58.699
No, no, no,
I'm just eating right now.

21:58.772 --> 21:59.932
You're not interrupting
anything.

22:00.007 --> 22:02.032
Are you serious?

22:02.109 --> 22:03.076
Just so you know,
that wasn't me.

22:03.143 --> 22:04.610
- That was J.W. I swear.
- Wow.

22:04.678 --> 22:05.736
What else?
Are you getting anything else?

22:05.812 --> 22:07.746
- Okay, listen, we'll come over tonight...
- Yeah, I'm just, I gotta...

22:07.814 --> 22:09.008
I gotta get back into it.

22:09.082 --> 22:10.106
- Okay?
- and we can meet afterwards.

22:10.183 --> 22:11.172
Great.

22:11.251 --> 22:13.776
Look, bro, when I see four girls
in matching bowling shirts...

22:13.854 --> 22:15.151
that's how I roll, man.

22:15.222 --> 22:16.849
It's totally true.

22:16.923 --> 22:18.083
Sorry, I'm,
like, totally thrown...

22:18.158 --> 22:19.125
No, it was great.

22:19.192 --> 22:21.183
- with the cell phone guy, um...
- I don't know where to begin.

22:21.261 --> 22:23.320
- We should just try another time.
- We started out with a donkey.

22:23.397 --> 22:24.989
Yeah,
I have to get going anyway.

22:25.065 --> 22:26.032
What are the odds there was...

22:26.099 --> 22:27.896
- two chicks named Darla?
- Oh. When'd you give her your card?

22:27.968 --> 22:30.459
That's all right. You got
your tricks, I've got mine.

22:30.537 --> 22:32.027
- Wow.
- Seriously?

22:32.105 --> 22:33.538
Yeah, but you don't really have
to be tricky...

22:33.607 --> 22:35.905
if you wanna pay for lunch,
because I won't fight ya.

22:35.976 --> 22:37.534
Yup. Cat person.

22:37.611 --> 22:39.272
I thought it was the one
without her.

22:39.346 --> 22:40.370
Thank you.

22:40.447 --> 22:42.210
I was actually really nervous
at first...

22:42.282 --> 22:43.442
but then it was so easy.

22:43.517 --> 22:44.541
I almost wanted it
to be harder...

22:44.618 --> 22:46.483
so I wouldn't feel bad
about the situation.

22:47.954 --> 22:49.046
- What?
- Ashley.

22:51.058 --> 22:52.855
- No.
- Look in my eyes.

22:52.926 --> 22:54.416
- No.
- It's time for a reality check.

22:54.494 --> 22:55.586
I don't want a reality check.

22:55.662 --> 22:56.959
You don't want one,
because you know you need one.

22:57.030 --> 22:59.157
Tell me you are done with this.

22:59.232 --> 23:00.256
I'm done...

23:01.568 --> 23:02.535
right after this next meeting.

23:02.602 --> 23:03.899
Why are you doing all this?

23:03.970 --> 23:05.267
I'm... I'm helping someone.

23:06.773 --> 23:08.035
Is he cute?

23:08.108 --> 23:09.473
I don't see what that has to do
with anything.

23:09.543 --> 23:10.510
Stay with me here.

23:10.577 --> 23:12.067
You, ahem...
You hate doing this.

23:12.145 --> 23:13.976
Yeah, it goes against
everything I believe.

23:14.047 --> 23:15.480
All right,
but instead of just doing it

23:15.549 --> 23:17.881
and getting it over with,
you're stretching it out.

23:17.951 --> 23:19.213
Well, he's very skeptical.

23:19.286 --> 23:21.413
I can't just blurt it out,
or else he'd never believe me.

23:21.488 --> 23:23.956
Today, you had lunch.
Tomorrow, who knows, dinner?

23:24.024 --> 23:25.218
Maybe you'll go to a movie...

23:25.292 --> 23:26.452
channel his fiancée there.

23:26.526 --> 23:27.720
- So off base.
- What does he do?

23:27.794 --> 23:29.625
- Veterinarian.
- A doctor.

23:29.696 --> 23:30.822
If you weren't gay,
I'd think you're jealous.

23:30.897 --> 23:31.864
If you weren't blushing...

23:31.932 --> 23:33.092
I'd think you were telling
the truth.

23:35.202 --> 23:37.227
So you like
David Foster Wallace, huh?

23:37.304 --> 23:38.635
I couldn't get past page 20.

23:38.705 --> 23:40.639
I keep it there
because it makes me look smart.

23:41.575 --> 23:43.065
Oh. Huh.

23:44.344 --> 23:46.244
Oh, God, is he, like, a friend
of yours or something?

23:50.550 --> 23:51.881
You got me a gift?

23:51.952 --> 23:54.011
Well, you won't charge me,
and I'm taking up your time...

23:54.087 --> 23:55.816
so, you know,
I had to do something.

23:58.759 --> 23:59.987
David Foster Wallace!

24:00.060 --> 24:01.687
I love him.

24:01.762 --> 24:03.923
I saw the book last time,
so I figured you were a fan.

24:03.997 --> 24:05.555
I am. I am.

24:05.632 --> 24:07.156
I can't wait to not read this.

24:07.234 --> 24:08.201
Yeah, they're short stories...

24:08.268 --> 24:09.792
so you could read
the first paragraph...

24:09.870 --> 24:11.064
of each one and then just quit.

24:11.138 --> 24:12.162
That's... That's great.

24:12.239 --> 24:14.207
No, this is, um...
This was really sweet of you.

24:14.274 --> 24:15.298
Thank you.

24:16.409 --> 24:17.467
Should we get started?

24:17.544 --> 24:18.670
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:19.546 --> 24:23.038
Oh, before we start, I've been
doing a little research.

24:24.184 --> 24:25.344
Okay.

24:25.418 --> 24:27.978
Some of the things you've said
are pretty unbelievable...

24:28.054 --> 24:30.113
and I think I know
how you're doing it.

24:31.091 --> 24:32.058
Really?

24:32.125 --> 24:33.558
Normally, in these readings...

24:33.627 --> 24:36.460
the person that's getting read
gives out unconscious signals.

24:36.530 --> 24:38.191
Like you could
suggest something...

24:38.265 --> 24:40.825
and then I'll
shake my head no or nod...

24:40.901 --> 24:42.869
and I don't even realize it,
but you pick up on it...

24:42.936 --> 24:44.233
and then you get closer
and closer...

24:44.304 --> 24:45.601
until you actually get
something.

24:46.406 --> 24:48.601
All right,
well, that makes sense.

24:48.675 --> 24:50.302
How do you...
How do you wanna deal with that?

24:50.377 --> 24:51.776
Well, I'm gonna concentrate
really hard...

24:51.845 --> 24:53.142
on not giving you anything.

24:53.213 --> 24:54.908
I mean,
keep my body very still...

24:54.981 --> 24:57.108
not change my voice. Nothin'.

24:57.184 --> 24:58.913
Okay. Sounds good.

24:58.985 --> 25:00.213
Uh, let's start.

25:00.287 --> 25:01.379
Okay.

25:02.989 --> 25:04.616
You're gonna talk like that
the whole time?

25:04.691 --> 25:06.022
Yes.

25:06.092 --> 25:07.116
You know what?

25:07.194 --> 25:09.560
I'm still picking up a slight
bit of emotion from you...

25:09.629 --> 25:10.857
so what I think
we should do...

25:10.931 --> 25:14.628
is turn our chairs back to back
so I can't see you at all.

25:14.701 --> 25:15.725
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:21.474 --> 25:23.066
- Better?
- Yes.

25:24.144 --> 25:25.111
You know what?

25:25.178 --> 25:27.305
To be safe, I think we should be
in separate rooms.

25:27.380 --> 25:29.371
Oh, but then
I'm gonna have to shout.

25:29.449 --> 25:31.417
Yeah, all right. Now you're
just messing with me, right?

25:33.486 --> 25:34.976
Yes.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.023
That's pretty stupid, huh?

25:37.090 --> 25:38.114
Yes.

25:38.191 --> 25:39.283
You wanna
go get something to eat?

25:39.359 --> 25:40.383
Yes.

25:44.464 --> 25:46.455
So, you bring
all your psychics here?

25:46.533 --> 25:48.160
Well, you really should know
the answer to that.

25:49.803 --> 25:51.498
But this is a cool place
that you picked...

25:51.571 --> 25:52.538
I'll give you that.

25:52.606 --> 25:54.130
Kate showed it to me.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.706
You know,
I'm getting the feeling...

26:00.780 --> 26:02.941
like she wants you
to be happy again...

26:03.016 --> 26:04.711
like when you used to come here.

26:06.019 --> 26:07.577
I'm getting that feeling, too.

26:18.198 --> 26:19.927
You are so screwed.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.968
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

26:22.869 --> 26:25.099
Oh. Right.

26:29.209 --> 26:30.233
Traitors.

26:30.310 --> 26:33.871
Lying, cheating,
red-headed hussy.

26:33.947 --> 26:35.141
I'll wring her neck.

26:36.449 --> 26:39.907
Throw her in front of a car,
throw her down some stairs.

26:39.986 --> 26:42.978
# She had blonde hair,
blue eyes, too #

26:43.056 --> 26:45.024
# And she had
a little itty-bitty #

26:45.091 --> 26:46.615
# Hootchie-cootchie-coo #

26:46.693 --> 26:48.524
You. You bastard.

26:48.595 --> 26:50.563
Whoa. Hey, evening, Miss.

26:51.464 --> 26:52.431
You can hear me?

26:52.499 --> 26:53.659
Unfortunately.

26:53.733 --> 26:54.700
Are you psychic?

26:54.768 --> 26:56.030
No, dead.

26:56.636 --> 26:58.069
Good. What happened?

26:58.138 --> 27:00.038
Drunk driving accident.

27:00.106 --> 27:01.903
Oh, so backing over me
with your truck wasn't enough...

27:01.975 --> 27:03.670
to get you to stop
drinking and driving?

27:03.743 --> 27:04.971
I'm not proud.

27:05.045 --> 27:06.103
What are you doing here?

27:06.179 --> 27:07.305
Same as you.

27:07.380 --> 27:10.645
Takin' care
of unfinished business.

27:10.717 --> 27:11.911
Are you sure
that's why you're here?

27:11.985 --> 27:13.247
That's what the lady told me.

27:13.320 --> 27:14.912
- The lady in the white room?
- 'Course.

27:14.988 --> 27:16.387
Why, what'd she tell you?

27:16.456 --> 27:17.480
None of your business.

27:18.325 --> 27:19.792
Did she give you any hints?

27:19.859 --> 27:21.622
How... How specific was she?

27:22.829 --> 27:24.922
Ah, you didn't talk to her,
did you?

27:25.865 --> 27:27.264
What'd you do, piss her off?

27:27.334 --> 27:28.631
Unfinished business.

27:31.438 --> 27:32.462
Well, that's it.

27:33.974 --> 27:35.498
I got to protect Henry.

27:35.575 --> 27:36.599
Yeah.

27:36.676 --> 27:38.371
Wh... Hey, hey!

27:39.646 --> 27:40.670
You're welcome.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.150
Hey. Can I help you?

27:46.219 --> 27:47.516
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.

27:47.587 --> 27:48.781
I called, and no one answered.

27:48.855 --> 27:51.688
Um, my friend gave me
your number in yoga class.

27:51.758 --> 27:53.350
Well, I'm just having
a really bad day.

27:53.426 --> 27:56.884
My... My friend died,
and we had a fight.

27:56.963 --> 27:59.625
Oh, okay, okay.
Sure, sure, sure, come in.

27:59.699 --> 28:00.927
Come in. It's fine.

28:01.001 --> 28:02.263
Thank you.

28:03.970 --> 28:06.097
Okay. Come right this way.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.002
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

28:10.076 --> 28:12.544
Oh, it's Kay... eleen.

28:12.612 --> 28:14.102
- Kayleen?
- Mm-hmm.

28:14.180 --> 28:15.772
Great.
Um, why don't you come this way.

28:15.849 --> 28:16.975
Uh, just have a seat.

28:17.050 --> 28:19.041
Do you want a drink or anything?

28:19.119 --> 28:20.086
No, I'm fine.

28:20.153 --> 28:21.120
Okay, great.

28:21.187 --> 28:22.984
Make yourself comfortable.

28:24.257 --> 28:25.622
Okay.

28:27.694 --> 28:29.127
So, you talk to dead people?

28:29.195 --> 28:31.288
Well, I can't promise results...

28:31.364 --> 28:33.355
but, yes,
I have had some success.

28:33.433 --> 28:35.424
Comes in nice and clear, huh?

28:35.502 --> 28:36.469
No mistaking it?

28:36.536 --> 28:37.696
Sometimes, yeah.

28:37.771 --> 28:38.829
Great. Can't wait.

28:38.905 --> 28:40.167
All right, so the first thing
I'm gonna have you do...

28:40.240 --> 28:41.434
is give me your hands.

28:41.508 --> 28:43.533
Uh, you...
Uh, we probably shouldn't...

28:43.610 --> 28:45.874
because I'm, uh,
coming down with a cold.

28:52.652 --> 28:55.553
Okay. Um, great.

28:55.622 --> 28:56.919
Okay, this is what
we'll do then.

28:56.990 --> 29:00.619
Um, why don't you concentrate
on your friend, okay?

29:00.693 --> 29:02.786
And let's try to see
if she can come through to us.

29:02.862 --> 29:04.557
- You're the psychic.
- Great.

29:11.171 --> 29:13.332
Yeah, wow,
I'm getting something.

29:13.406 --> 29:17.365
Ashley Clark, you have made
a mockery of the gifts...

29:17.444 --> 29:18.934
you've been given.

29:19.012 --> 29:20.980
Uh, Kayleen?

29:21.047 --> 29:23.515
You speak falsely for the dead.

29:23.583 --> 29:26.552
We have been sent here
to give you a warning.

29:26.619 --> 29:30.646
Stop now or suffer
a terrible fate.

29:30.723 --> 29:32.156
Is this some sort of joke?

29:32.225 --> 29:33.556
This is no joke.

29:33.626 --> 29:36.561
We see and hear everything.

29:36.629 --> 29:40.190
We saw you drop the tray
of meatballs last night...

29:40.266 --> 29:42.530
and still serve them.

29:42.602 --> 29:45.628
We saw what you did
in the shower last night...

29:46.539 --> 29:48.404
and it's nothing
to be ashamed of...

29:48.475 --> 29:50.773
but we still saw.

29:50.844 --> 29:52.744
And we see
what you're trying to do...

29:52.812 --> 29:54.302
to Henry Mills.

29:54.380 --> 29:56.314
I... I'm just...

29:56.382 --> 29:57.508
You, of all people...

29:57.584 --> 30:00.451
should know the consequences
of defaming the dead.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.454
Leave Henry Mills alone...

30:02.522 --> 30:05.252
or you will never
find peace again.

30:05.325 --> 30:08.590
You will lose your possessions,
your friends...

30:08.661 --> 30:12.028
and eventually your life.

30:12.098 --> 30:16.125
This is the only time
we will visit you.

30:21.808 --> 30:24.208
Oh, I must've dozed off.

30:24.277 --> 30:25.801
Did you contact my friend?

30:26.946 --> 30:28.277
Ashley, are you okay?

30:30.884 --> 30:31.873
Please go.

30:31.951 --> 30:33.976
Well, you look
like you've seen a ghost.

30:34.053 --> 30:36.248
Can you go now, please?

30:36.322 --> 30:37.346
Just go.

30:57.443 --> 30:58.842
You'll never guess
who I ran into.

30:58.912 --> 31:00.174
- Who?
- Ashley.

31:01.481 --> 31:02.880
Ashley...

31:02.949 --> 31:04.541
I know so many Ashleys.

31:04.617 --> 31:05.584
The psychic.

31:05.652 --> 31:07.745
Oh, that Ashley.

31:07.820 --> 31:09.811
- What did she say?
- Well, it was really weird.

31:09.889 --> 31:13.552
I mean, she got these images,
really specific stuff.

31:13.626 --> 31:15.355
Really? Wow.

31:15.428 --> 31:16.554
Will she get a message
from Kate?

31:17.730 --> 31:19.391
- Like what?
- Huh?

31:19.465 --> 31:20.830
- What?
- What?

31:21.801 --> 31:24.929
Anyway, we're, you know,
gonna try it again.

31:25.004 --> 31:26.767
That's great.
That's... I really...

31:26.839 --> 31:28.431
I feel like
she can help you, Henry.

31:28.975 --> 31:30.533
Come on, Ashley!

31:32.078 --> 31:33.443
Ashley, come on!

31:33.513 --> 31:35.037
She's not home?

31:36.182 --> 31:38.275
Uh, why?

31:38.351 --> 31:39.375
Are you here to meet her?

31:39.452 --> 31:41.317
No, we had, um, an appointment.

31:41.387 --> 31:43.116
Wait a second.
Are you Henry...

31:43.189 --> 31:44.850
the-the veterinarian?

31:44.924 --> 31:46.118
She mentioned me?

31:46.192 --> 31:47.454
No, it's just
a really lucky guess.

31:47.527 --> 31:48.926
I'm good like that.

31:48.995 --> 31:50.428
I'm Dan, the catering partner.

31:50.496 --> 31:51.895
- Right. Hi, Dan.
- Hi.

31:51.965 --> 31:53.592
Yeah, we were supposed to meet
an hour and a half ago...

31:53.666 --> 31:55.930
at this restaurant, but
she's not answering her phone.

31:56.002 --> 31:57.731
I know.
I've been calling her all day.

31:57.804 --> 31:58.828
Do you mind if I try?

31:59.706 --> 32:01.333
Knocking?

32:01.407 --> 32:04.205
Please. No, please.
Help yourself.

32:04.277 --> 32:06.177
Maybe later you can come
jab an elevator button...

32:06.246 --> 32:07.907
a hundred times
after I've already pushed it.

32:10.550 --> 32:11.517
Ashley!

32:11.584 --> 32:13.745
Ashley, it's Henry.
Are you there?

32:14.787 --> 32:16.516
Henry, I'm sick!

32:16.589 --> 32:19.149
I tried to call.

32:19.225 --> 32:21.523
I might be sick
for a really long time.

32:22.962 --> 32:24.327
Okay, do you need anything?

32:24.397 --> 32:27.958
No. I'll call you
if I ever feel better.

32:28.034 --> 32:29.365
Ashley?

32:30.003 --> 32:31.129
Ashley!

32:35.108 --> 32:36.336
Got more than you did.

32:40.613 --> 32:43.013
Hey, it's Ashley,
psychic-slash-caterer...

32:43.082 --> 32:44.413
leave an awesome message.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.042
Good morning. It's Henry.

32:46.119 --> 32:47.677
Just thought I'd check in
since you didn't...

32:47.754 --> 32:48.706
# This little light of mine #

32:48.707 --> 32:50.314
sound so good last night,
see if you're all right.

32:50.390 --> 32:53.587
- So, um, you all right?
- # I'm gonna let it shine #

32:53.660 --> 32:54.957
Morning again.

32:55.028 --> 32:56.859
It's, uh, Henry again.

32:56.929 --> 32:58.829
That's some cold.
I hope you didn't get it...

32:58.898 --> 33:00.092
when we went out
the other night.

33:00.166 --> 33:01.360
Anyway, I was gonna...

33:01.434 --> 33:03.595
you know, come by and drop off
some soup or something...

33:03.670 --> 33:05.934
so, um, maybe I'll see you.

33:07.407 --> 33:09.773
# Shine, let it shine #

33:09.842 --> 33:13.073
# Even if it burns your eyes #

33:13.146 --> 33:15.842
# This light of mine is mine #

33:15.915 --> 33:17.678
- # And I'm gonna let it shine #
- It's Henry.

33:17.750 --> 33:20.548
The sandwich was gone, so,
you know, that's a good sign.

33:20.620 --> 33:21.917
Buying a sandwich for someone...

33:21.988 --> 33:23.148
you've never
had a sandwich with...

33:23.222 --> 33:24.484
is a lot harder than you think.

33:24.557 --> 33:25.956
I mean, just the bread.

33:26.025 --> 33:27.492
I started off
with whole wheat...

33:27.560 --> 33:29.528
but then I worried that,
you know, I'm saying...

33:29.595 --> 33:31.028
you're kind
of a crunchy person...

33:31.097 --> 33:32.758
who only eats whole wheat.

33:32.832 --> 33:35.323
I almost went with pumpernickel,
but then I'd look like...

33:35.401 --> 33:36.891
the kind of guy
who wants to impose...

33:36.969 --> 33:39.301
my weird bread fetish
on everyone and...

33:39.372 --> 33:42.034
You know, now, I'm one of those
idiots who just prattles on...

33:42.108 --> 33:43.598
in, uh, answering machines...

33:45.078 --> 33:46.875
and also uses a word
like "prattles."

33:48.081 --> 33:50.447
So the only thing I can think of
is that, uh, you really just...

33:50.516 --> 33:51.778
you don't
wanna talk to me anymore.

33:52.885 --> 33:56.480
Um, if that's right,
well, um...

33:56.556 --> 33:57.921
I don't know, I guess just...

33:57.990 --> 33:59.651
kinda keep doin'
what you're doin'.

34:01.260 --> 34:03.660
- # Shine, let it shine #
- So, take care of yourself...

34:03.730 --> 34:06.824
- # Even if it burns your eyes #
- Ashley.

34:06.899 --> 34:09.458
# This light of mine is mine #

34:09.534 --> 34:11.900
# And I'm gonna let it shine #

34:12.871 --> 34:14.396
There you are.

34:14.474 --> 34:15.600
Why have you been avoiding
my brother?

34:15.675 --> 34:17.335
Uh, I can explain.

34:17.409 --> 34:18.467
Um...

34:22.748 --> 34:24.080
I guess I can't explain.

34:24.150 --> 34:25.139
Okay,
if you didn't wanna do this...

34:25.217 --> 34:26.185
you should've just said so...

34:26.252 --> 34:27.378
but to lead him on
and let him think...

34:27.453 --> 34:29.080
that you can help him
and then just disappear?

34:29.822 --> 34:31.585
I mean, he's worse off,
if that's possible.

34:31.657 --> 34:32.715
I just couldn't do it anymore,
all right?

34:32.792 --> 34:33.759
I'm sorry.

34:33.826 --> 34:35.157
Please tell him I'm sorry.

34:35.228 --> 34:36.388
Did you run out of things
to say?

34:36.462 --> 34:37.429
- No, it's not that. It's not that.
- Because I have...

34:37.496 --> 34:38.464
- It's not...
- more information.

34:38.531 --> 34:39.964
I have letters
and some pictures and...

34:40.032 --> 34:41.623
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's Kate.

34:47.072 --> 34:48.563
Oh, God!

34:48.641 --> 34:49.608
Wait, what do...
What does that mean?

34:49.675 --> 34:51.438
Do... Do you want the letters?

34:51.511 --> 34:54.309
All right, show's over.

34:55.415 --> 34:57.315
Come out. I know who you are...

34:57.383 --> 34:58.350
Kate.

34:58.418 --> 34:59.680
- Boo.
- God.

35:00.586 --> 35:03.521
God, it's really you.
This is unbelievable.

35:03.589 --> 35:05.113
- Are you really like a...
- Ghost?

35:06.092 --> 35:07.320
It's the only way
I can explain it.

35:07.393 --> 35:08.621
That is awesome.

35:09.562 --> 35:10.961
Here, catch.

35:15.201 --> 35:16.168
Nice throw.

35:16.235 --> 35:17.327
Crap.

35:18.438 --> 35:20.235
Hey, what was that
the other day, man?

35:20.306 --> 35:22.467
I was just trying to help out
the situation.

35:22.542 --> 35:23.509
Help?

35:23.576 --> 35:25.203
You were helping yourself
to Henry.

35:26.479 --> 35:27.503
Okay, so, like, I'm like...

35:27.580 --> 35:29.775
I'm like
slightly attracted to him.

35:29.849 --> 35:30.941
Well, he's not right for you.

35:31.017 --> 35:32.177
Yes, he is.

35:32.251 --> 35:35.982
He is considerate, and
he is sweet, and, you know...

35:36.055 --> 35:37.955
pulls the chair out for me
when I sit.

35:38.024 --> 35:38.991
Big deal.

35:39.058 --> 35:40.753
It is a big deal,
and you know it, okay?

35:40.827 --> 35:42.522
He's been wonderful to me
from the second he met me...

35:42.595 --> 35:44.290
even though he probably thought
I was a little crazy.

35:44.363 --> 35:45.330
Well, you do
talk to dead people.

35:45.398 --> 35:46.365
That's a little crazy.

35:46.432 --> 35:47.626
Oh, I'm crazy?

35:47.700 --> 35:50.464
You're the one who's spying
on me in the frickin' shower.

35:51.504 --> 35:54.098
You're right.
I'm sorry about that.

35:54.173 --> 35:57.540
You know what, girl to girl,
you're gettin' a little hippy.

35:57.610 --> 35:59.168
You might wanna cut back
on the pasta.

36:01.247 --> 36:02.236
All right, what do you want?

36:02.315 --> 36:04.374
I'm serious. Why are you here?

36:04.450 --> 36:05.678
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot...

36:05.751 --> 36:07.582
and that's partly my fault...

36:07.653 --> 36:09.177
with the threats
from beyond and all.

36:09.255 --> 36:10.552
- Yeah.
- But here's the thing.

36:10.623 --> 36:12.853
I was sent back to earth
to protect Henry.

36:12.925 --> 36:14.790
Really? How do you know that?

36:14.861 --> 36:18.126
Because when you die,
you go to this white room...

36:18.197 --> 36:21.894
and there's a woman who may
or may not be an angel...

36:21.968 --> 36:26.428
and she says that, you know,
just, you know...

36:26.506 --> 36:28.337
stuff, and I just know.

36:29.909 --> 36:32.434
So, like, I have to like
stay away from Henry now?

36:32.512 --> 36:35.106
Oh, that would be so great.
Thank you.

36:37.183 --> 36:38.741
Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:38.818 --> 36:40.251
But you're dead.

36:40.319 --> 36:41.877
I still don't want you
to see him.

36:41.954 --> 36:43.387
Yeah, I know,
but for argument's sake...

36:43.456 --> 36:44.548
I mean,
if I wanted to see him...

36:44.624 --> 36:46.182
there's not a whole hell
of a lot you could do about it.

36:46.259 --> 36:47.283
Really?

36:47.860 --> 36:50.158
Then why have you been hiding
in your bedroom for a week?

36:51.030 --> 36:52.190
Well, I'm done hiding.

36:52.265 --> 36:53.698
Let's not let this get ugly.

36:53.766 --> 36:54.733
I think it already has.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.062
You have no idea.

36:58.971 --> 36:59.995
Ashley?

37:00.072 --> 37:01.801
Hi, Henry.

37:01.874 --> 37:03.239
Oh, sorry.

37:03.309 --> 37:04.298
"Dr. Mills."

37:04.377 --> 37:06.242
Oh, hey, you're alive.

37:06.312 --> 37:07.677
Yeah, thanks to you.

37:10.349 --> 37:11.373
You're a real lifesaver.

37:11.450 --> 37:12.417
Know... You know,
the food that you left me...

37:12.485 --> 37:13.952
was the only thing
that kept me going.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.248
Oh, you got that. Good.

37:15.321 --> 37:16.754
I left a couple
of messages, but...

37:16.822 --> 37:18.949
I know. I'm so sorry.
I, um...

37:19.025 --> 37:21.357
I just... I felt so ill
that I couldn't talk to anyone.

37:21.427 --> 37:22.394
But the minute I felt better...

37:22.461 --> 37:24.725
I wanted to come down here
and thank you in person.

37:24.797 --> 37:26.059
I hope you're not mad at me.

37:26.132 --> 37:27.759
No, not at all. I...

37:27.833 --> 37:29.494
I'm sorry that I called
and bothered you.

37:29.569 --> 37:31.161
I mean, you said that you'd call
when you felt better...

37:31.237 --> 37:32.795
and here you are.

37:32.872 --> 37:34.271
Do you wanna go out tonight?

37:38.044 --> 37:39.909
Yeah. All right. I'd love to.

37:39.979 --> 37:41.537
Okay, great.

37:41.614 --> 37:43.104
Oh, great. Oh, great.

37:43.182 --> 37:45.616
I'll let you get back
to saving animals' lives...

37:45.685 --> 37:47.209
and everything.

37:47.286 --> 37:48.446
Okay.

37:57.396 --> 37:59.125
And what seems to be
the trouble with Margaret?

37:59.198 --> 38:00.597
Itchy ass.

38:00.666 --> 38:01.860
Excellent.

38:18.951 --> 38:19.918
Oh!

38:19.986 --> 38:21.613
Oh, God!

38:22.922 --> 38:23.889
Ashley, hello.

38:23.956 --> 38:25.321
What was that crash?
I heard a crash.

38:26.559 --> 38:27.719
- Ashley, hello.
- Shit.

38:27.793 --> 38:29.124
What is going on?
Is there someone there?

38:29.195 --> 38:30.162
Is someone at your place?

38:30.229 --> 38:31.196
- Hello.
- You know what...

38:31.263 --> 38:33.094
- Hello!
- I'm callin' the police.

38:33.165 --> 38:34.792
I'm giving you ten seconds
to pick up.

38:34.867 --> 38:39.736
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

38:39.805 --> 38:41.500
Dan. Sorry.

38:41.574 --> 38:43.041
The phone scared me,
so I killed it.

38:43.109 --> 38:44.940
What's going on?
Where have you been?

38:45.011 --> 38:46.911
- Why haven't you talked to me?
- It's a long story.

38:46.979 --> 38:48.105
I've got time.

38:48.180 --> 38:49.408
I... I can't talk right now.

38:49.482 --> 38:50.449
Why don't you
come over tomorrow...

38:50.516 --> 38:51.778
we'll work on the Spencer party.
I got to go.

38:51.851 --> 38:52.909
Where are you off to?

38:52.985 --> 38:54.577
The gym. Okay?
I got to go. Bye.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.654
- Oh, wait, Dan!
- Yeah?

38:56.722 --> 38:58.087
Would you say I'm hippy?

38:58.991 --> 39:01.289
# Goddess on the mountain top #

39:01.360 --> 39:04.124
# Burning like a silver flame #

39:04.196 --> 39:06.824
# The summit
of beauty and love #

39:06.899 --> 39:08.093
# And Venus was her name #

39:08.167 --> 39:09.532
# Whoa #

39:11.237 --> 39:12.898
There's a gas leak
in the building.

39:12.972 --> 39:14.735
Everyone get out now.

39:14.807 --> 39:16.069
This is an emergency.

39:20.946 --> 39:22.504
It'll be fine
if we just don't freak out!

39:22.581 --> 39:24.139
It's all right! It's okay!

39:24.216 --> 39:26.184
We'll be right
if we just stay cool!

39:26.252 --> 39:28.618
Just stay cool, guys!
Just don't light a match!

39:30.923 --> 39:32.413
What... Everyone out!

39:34.894 --> 39:35.861
Oh, no.

39:35.928 --> 39:37.259
- Miss?
- The...

39:37.329 --> 39:38.887
It was just the P.A.

39:40.099 --> 39:41.293
Was there an announcement
on the P. A?

39:42.735 --> 39:43.929
What P. A?

39:44.003 --> 39:48.064
Stairmaster's open,
you know, for your... Mm-hmm.

39:48.708 --> 39:50.733
Miss.

39:50.810 --> 39:53.370
Yeah. I was just...

39:53.446 --> 39:55.812
Well, look at me, hmm?

39:55.881 --> 39:57.576
Naked in there, okay.

39:57.650 --> 39:59.777
Just kidding.
Sorry about that, you guys.

39:59.852 --> 40:01.149
I'm crazy.

40:04.623 --> 40:05.817
So, do you have any idea
where you wanna eat?

40:05.891 --> 40:06.858
Um, no.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.621
I mean, if you have a place...
some place in mind or...

40:08.694 --> 40:10.355
No, it's your treat,
so, you know...

40:10.429 --> 40:11.396
I'm gonna let you choose.

40:11.464 --> 40:15.161
Oh, well, in that case, I just...
I know just the place, actually.

40:15.835 --> 40:16.961
No, I was... I was kidding.

40:17.036 --> 40:18.003
Do you wanna get some seafood?

40:18.070 --> 40:19.196
Oh, no, no, big talker...

40:19.271 --> 40:21.239
you're now gonna eat
a hot dog out of a cart.

40:22.541 --> 40:24.168
- Hey.
- Sor... Oh, sorry.

40:24.243 --> 40:25.904
Uh, one Italian sausage.

40:26.679 --> 40:28.442
- Thank you.
- No, make it two.

40:28.514 --> 40:29.981
If you're sure you wouldn't
rather have seafood.

40:30.049 --> 40:31.448
No, we're...
No, we're fine with the two.

40:31.517 --> 40:33.007
Two Italian sausage.
Thank you.

40:36.188 --> 40:37.985
Are you going to treat me
to a funnel cake, too?

40:38.057 --> 40:39.422
Only if you're a good boy.

40:41.060 --> 40:42.288
Watch out for that.

40:43.963 --> 40:46.329
Stop it, please.
It's really not funny.

40:46.398 --> 40:48.025
No, you're right.
That's horrible.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.201
Stop, 'cause if you wanna play,
I'll play that game.

40:54.273 --> 40:55.604
You wanna play that game?

40:55.674 --> 40:57.539
Oh, my God! Oh!

40:57.610 --> 40:59.840
Ohh!

40:59.912 --> 41:01.277
Oh.

41:01.347 --> 41:02.371
Let me just...

41:09.989 --> 41:11.251
You got a little somethin', uh...

41:12.992 --> 41:14.254
I can't believe
you're not embarrassed...

41:14.326 --> 41:16.226
to be seen with me right now.

41:16.295 --> 41:17.762
Oh, God, no, no, I totally am.

41:17.830 --> 41:18.922
- Oh.
- Yeah.

41:18.998 --> 41:20.431
If I run into anybody
that I know...

41:20.499 --> 41:22.160
I'm gonna pretend
you're a German tourist.

41:22.935 --> 41:24.300
I don't wanna be associated
with you.

41:24.370 --> 41:25.462
Do you know any German?

41:25.871 --> 41:28.965
Uh... Ich machen dachen
zeit yachen...

41:29.041 --> 41:30.975
tick wagen
fahr Fig Newton...

41:31.043 --> 41:32.874
in BMW en zag.

41:32.945 --> 41:34.276
It's kinda like
a Swedish German.

41:34.346 --> 41:35.608
- Yeah.
- Nice.

41:35.681 --> 41:36.705
- It's not. Yeah.
- It's good.

41:36.782 --> 41:38.750
Yes, no, I think the bathrooms
are over there...

41:38.818 --> 41:41.582
German lady,
who's from also Sweden...

41:41.654 --> 41:42.712
that I don't even know.

41:44.590 --> 41:46.080
Hey, I feel kind of weird
bringing this up...

41:46.158 --> 41:48.718
but have you thought
about Kate lately?

41:50.763 --> 41:53.926
Um, yeah, not really.

41:53.999 --> 41:56.194
I mean, you know
how I feel about all that...

41:56.268 --> 41:58.759
but you said
some pretty amazing things.

41:58.838 --> 42:00.533
Can I ask you a question?

42:00.606 --> 42:01.698
Sure.

42:02.708 --> 42:04.972
Um, there's no right
or wrong answer to this...

42:05.044 --> 42:08.377
so you can just be honest,
but, um, are we...

42:09.181 --> 42:11.513
Are we out to talk about Kate...

42:11.584 --> 42:15.748
or-or are we,
you know, just out?

42:15.821 --> 42:18.619
Because, either way
is totally fine with me.

42:18.691 --> 42:21.353
I just... If it's both...

42:22.728 --> 42:26.220
then it probably gets, like,
a little complicated for me.

42:26.999 --> 42:29.433
Yeah, I was kind of wondering
the same thing, actually.

42:29.501 --> 42:31.833
I mean, are we out
because I'm your client...

42:31.904 --> 42:33.929
or are we out?

42:58.664 --> 43:00.222
Oh, great, I'm your client.

43:03.269 --> 43:04.293
That sucks.

43:09.541 --> 43:10.508
I had a good time.

43:10.576 --> 43:11.736
Me, too.

43:13.479 --> 43:14.537
I'll call you tomorrow.

43:14.613 --> 43:15.705
Okay, you don't have to.

43:15.781 --> 43:16.839
No, I want to.

43:16.916 --> 43:19.180
Okay. Okay, me, too.

43:20.152 --> 43:21.176
Okay.

43:24.223 --> 43:25.247
Bye.

43:42.808 --> 43:44.241
Forgetting something?

43:44.843 --> 43:47.505
Was I somehow unclear
about what I wanted you to do?

43:48.414 --> 43:49.972
Oh, were you expecting Henry?

43:50.049 --> 43:52.984
I was hoping.
He's quite a kisser.

43:53.052 --> 43:54.610
You're really gonna
throw that in my face?

43:54.687 --> 43:56.382
Isn't that tactic
a little beneath you?

43:56.455 --> 43:57.422
You're one to talk!

43:57.489 --> 44:00.014
I had to show a room
full of guys my naked breasts...

44:00.092 --> 44:01.320
because of you!

44:04.029 --> 44:06.691
That's a nice gesture,
but unnecessary, dear.

44:06.765 --> 44:08.528
Oh, I was... Um...

44:08.600 --> 44:09.897
Good night.

44:13.772 --> 44:15.364
Bingo, come on.

44:15.441 --> 44:16.408
That dog just sniffed you.

44:16.475 --> 44:18.375
God, I think
the animals can see you.

44:18.444 --> 44:19.468
That is so cool.

44:19.545 --> 44:20.534
That's great.

44:20.612 --> 44:22.239
Wonder how I can use that
against you?

44:22.314 --> 44:23.281
Hey, I showed it to you.

44:23.349 --> 44:24.748
Yeah, that was dumb.

44:26.051 --> 44:27.018
I don't understand.

44:27.086 --> 44:29.452
If you weren't sick,
then what was the problem?

44:29.521 --> 44:30.488
I can't get into it...

44:30.556 --> 44:31.784
because you're
gonna think I'm crazy.

44:31.857 --> 44:32.824
No, no, no. I'll hide it.

44:32.891 --> 44:35.951
I promise, I'll look at you
really sincerely and say...

44:36.028 --> 44:37.359
"I understand."

44:39.498 --> 44:41.989
- Okay. Fine.
- Good.

44:42.067 --> 44:43.329
You remember Henry, right?

44:43.402 --> 44:44.767
Yeah, yeah.
The guy with the wife...

44:44.837 --> 44:45.929
that was the crushed
by the angel.

44:46.005 --> 44:47.495
Right. I saw her.

44:49.375 --> 44:51.570
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

44:51.643 --> 44:55.374
Uh, now,
when you say, uh, you saw her...

44:57.116 --> 44:58.174
you mean you saw...

44:58.250 --> 44:59.979
- Her ghost, yes.
- Mm.

45:00.052 --> 45:01.679
Yeah, she's been hassling me.

45:01.754 --> 45:03.016
I understand.

45:03.088 --> 45:05.147
No, Dan, this is not a joke.

45:05.224 --> 45:07.055
Look, I've heard voices
before and stuff like that...

45:07.126 --> 45:08.650
but I've actually seen her.

45:08.727 --> 45:09.853
Do you see her right now?

45:09.928 --> 45:11.293
No, I only see her
when she wants me to see her...

45:11.363 --> 45:12.557
I think. I don't know.

45:13.665 --> 45:15.155
You know what?
Never mind. I'm kidding.

45:15.234 --> 45:16.724
I seriously was kidding.
I totally made that up.

45:16.802 --> 45:17.928
Let's cook. I bought salmon.

45:18.003 --> 45:19.903
You... You really believe this,
don't you?

45:19.972 --> 45:21.030
It's really happening.

45:21.106 --> 45:23.506
And it's only you.
No one else can see or hear her?

45:23.575 --> 45:25.372
Yeah. I don't know why I'm
the only one who can see her.

45:25.444 --> 45:27.435
Maybe because I'm after the guy
she was supposed to marry.

45:27.513 --> 45:29.140
Maybe that's sufficient
motivation for her...

45:29.214 --> 45:30.579
to come back from the dead.
I don't know.

45:30.649 --> 45:33.243
I note that
during your little rant...

45:33.318 --> 45:36.219
defending your sanity,
you admit you're after him.

45:39.525 --> 45:40.719
Well, yeah, I mean,
we're like...

45:40.793 --> 45:42.590
We're like... We're
sort of dating or whatever.

45:43.462 --> 45:44.486
Ashley.

45:45.864 --> 45:48.059
No, I don't want
a reality check.

45:48.133 --> 45:49.896
This is what happens
when you lie...

45:49.968 --> 45:51.868
about talking
to a man's dead fiancée.

45:51.937 --> 45:52.995
I've seen it a thousand times.

45:53.072 --> 45:54.801
No, because I'm not lying, okay?

45:54.873 --> 45:56.898
I can actually talk to her.
That's different.

45:56.975 --> 45:58.806
Okay, I was lying before...

45:58.877 --> 45:59.969
because I actually
couldn't talk to her.

46:00.045 --> 46:01.740
And also, admittedly...

46:01.814 --> 46:03.247
I lied to you
about being interested in him.

46:03.315 --> 46:04.475
So I am sorry about that.

46:04.550 --> 46:05.539
Yeah, listen,
while you work that out...

46:05.617 --> 46:07.482
maybe this can bubble
into your subconscious.

46:07.553 --> 46:08.781
Run away!

46:08.854 --> 46:10.685
I mean, you have dated guys
with every problem there is...

46:10.756 --> 46:13.156
but this one, apparently,
has a ghost?

46:13.225 --> 46:14.886
Yeah, but it's not his fault
his fiancée's haunting me.

46:14.960 --> 46:15.112
Mm.

46:15.113 --> 46:17.292
Look, it's impossible
to find a great guy...

46:17.362 --> 46:18.659
and I'm not gonna
let a little thing...

46:18.730 --> 46:19.924
like a ghost stop me, okay?

46:19.998 --> 46:21.397
I'm not gonna let her win.

46:21.467 --> 46:22.434
You mean her ghost?

46:22.501 --> 46:23.627
- Right.
- I understand.

46:23.702 --> 46:25.135
I'm going to the market.
Bone the fish.

46:40.619 --> 46:42.484
Are you all right?
Why are you screaming?

46:43.422 --> 46:44.821
No, I wasn't.

46:44.890 --> 46:45.982
I was... I was singing.

46:48.427 --> 46:49.485
Thanks.

46:56.668 --> 46:57.794
Father Marks?

46:57.870 --> 46:58.837
Ashley.

46:58.904 --> 46:59.962
That's me.

47:00.038 --> 47:03.735
I haven't seen you in,
what's it been, ten years?

47:03.809 --> 47:06.243
I've been
to a few Christmas services.

47:06.311 --> 47:08.677
Well, next Christmas, why don't
you come up and say hello?

47:08.747 --> 47:10.840
Absolutely.
I will put that in my calendar.

47:10.916 --> 47:12.508
December the 25th.

47:12.584 --> 47:14.279
Got it.

47:14.353 --> 47:15.411
Well, you didn't come here...

47:15.487 --> 47:17.978
so I could make you squirm
about your attendance.

47:18.056 --> 47:19.216
Now that you mention it.

47:20.225 --> 47:25.595
Um... Father, um, I've... I've...

47:25.664 --> 47:26.995
I've had an encounter...

47:28.600 --> 47:30.500
encounters with a ghost.

47:30.569 --> 47:31.797
Well, you musn't be
completely surprised...

47:31.870 --> 47:33.667
that this is happening to you.

47:33.739 --> 47:34.967
I mean, if you dabble
with the occult...

47:35.040 --> 47:37.474
you're bound to get
these kind of incidents.

47:37.543 --> 47:38.942
- I know.
- Well, all right.

47:39.011 --> 47:40.842
You're not here
to get a lecture from me.

47:40.913 --> 47:42.403
So why did you come here?

47:44.349 --> 47:45.577
I want you to get rid of her.

47:47.686 --> 47:49.847
Do you see the ghost now?

47:49.922 --> 47:50.889
No.

47:50.956 --> 47:53.857
And this room is where
you've seen her the most?

47:53.926 --> 47:55.416
Definitely.
This is definitely the room...

47:55.494 --> 47:56.825
where I see her most.

47:59.565 --> 48:01.726
So, uh, is there a script
for this sort of thing?

48:01.800 --> 48:03.927
For exorcism? Oh sure, sure.

48:04.002 --> 48:05.230
No, when you're
casting out spirits...

48:05.304 --> 48:07.738
the Church doesn't really
like us to wing it.

48:07.806 --> 48:09.000
Right. Of course.

48:11.343 --> 48:13.106
- Shall we?
- Yes.

48:13.178 --> 48:14.702
Yes.

48:14.780 --> 48:17.544
"I address thee, spirit,
in the name of the Father...

48:17.616 --> 48:20.380
"and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

48:20.452 --> 48:23.421
"Come out
and leave this servant of God."

48:23.488 --> 48:24.887
You don't really believe
this is gonna work.

48:24.957 --> 48:26.549
I see her. She's right there.

48:29.294 --> 48:31.694
"It is time
for your soul to pass on.

48:31.763 --> 48:34.732
"Hear the command
of God himself...

48:34.800 --> 48:35.960
"who did
walk upon the sea...

48:36.034 --> 48:37.797
"and extend his right hand
to Peter."

48:37.869 --> 48:40.269
You really don't believe
in all this hocus-pocus, do you?

48:40.339 --> 48:42.330
"In the name of God, the
Almighty Father...

48:42.407 --> 48:44.602
- "that thou depart..."
- Oh, that's not good.

48:44.676 --> 48:46.439
It's working. It's working.

48:46.511 --> 48:48.411
Uh, okay, Ashley, listen.

48:48.480 --> 48:51.176
I've been reconsidering,
and I think we can come...

48:51.250 --> 48:53.343
- to some sort of understanding.
- "Let the Holy Spirit...

48:53.418 --> 48:54.715
"dwell therein."

48:54.786 --> 48:56.413
Okay, uh, s-s-some of the...

48:56.488 --> 48:58.956
some of the things I did,
a little out of hand...

48:59.024 --> 49:01.754
and I'd like to take
this opportunity to apologize.

49:01.827 --> 49:05.422
You know, the whole naked
in the gym thing, not cool.

49:05.497 --> 49:06.521
I get it now.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.693
- What's happening?
- "Therefore, restless spirit...

49:10.769 --> 49:11.758
Oh, make it stop!

49:11.837 --> 49:13.862
"acknowledge
that your time has ended."

49:13.939 --> 49:17.067
Please, I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go!

49:21.146 --> 49:22.170
She's gone.

49:25.317 --> 49:26.341
Yeah.

49:27.719 --> 49:28.981
You did it.

49:29.054 --> 49:30.453
- You sure?
- Yeah.

49:30.522 --> 49:32.888
I'm... I'm... I'm sure.

49:32.958 --> 49:33.982
She was right there...

49:35.294 --> 49:36.989
and then she vanished.

49:37.062 --> 49:38.495
Well, bugger me.

49:39.831 --> 49:40.855
Good.

49:41.867 --> 49:43.494
- Good.
- Very good.

49:45.771 --> 49:49.935
So, you're, uh, finished
with your psychic work?

49:50.008 --> 49:51.942
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's over.

49:52.010 --> 49:54.604
And we'll see you in church
on a regular basis?

49:54.680 --> 49:56.204
We didn't agree to that
before we started.

49:56.281 --> 49:57.805
Oh, I'll bring her back.

49:58.717 --> 50:00.082
It's a deal. It's a deal.
I promise.

50:00.152 --> 50:02.450
Okay. No more of these games.

50:02.521 --> 50:04.352
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Take care of yourself...

50:04.423 --> 50:05.390
- Ashley Clark.
- Bye-bye.

50:07.759 --> 50:09.317
He sounded so serious.

50:09.394 --> 50:11.328
No! No!

50:11.396 --> 50:12.420
Did you like
that disappearing thing?

50:12.497 --> 50:13.486
I just made that up.

50:13.565 --> 50:14.998
I didn't even know
I could do that before now.

50:15.701 --> 50:17.669
Okay, time to get to work.

50:17.736 --> 50:20.637
Tonight, instead of sleeping,
I thought I'd tell you...

50:20.706 --> 50:23.766
all the stories
of all the pets I've ever owned.

50:24.643 --> 50:26.770
- Oh, people love pet stories.
- Just... Just...

50:26.845 --> 50:29.370
So, I'm gonna start
with the first pet I ever had.

50:29.448 --> 50:32.713
It was a turtle named Ernie,
and I must've been eight.

50:32.784 --> 50:34.046
She actually had kittens.

50:34.119 --> 50:35.746
She had baby kittens,
and then we named them all.

50:35.821 --> 50:38.517
And we used to call him Boots,
because he was all white...

50:38.590 --> 50:39.955
and he had these little black...

50:40.025 --> 50:41.856
- Boots?
- Exactly.

50:41.927 --> 50:45.454
At least that's what we called
him until "he" had kittens.

50:45.530 --> 50:47.691
Then we named him Mrs. Piggy.

50:47.766 --> 50:50.792
And there were six kittens.
What were their names?

50:55.907 --> 50:56.965
Was that you?

50:57.809 --> 50:59.174
The doorbell?

50:59.244 --> 51:00.711
Yeah, that was me.
Don't answer that.

51:14.092 --> 51:15.992
I remember the kittens' names!

51:16.061 --> 51:19.326
It was Willy, Betty, Whiskers...

51:19.398 --> 51:21.229
Fang, Teddy, and Nugget!

51:21.299 --> 51:23.893
And then there was Buffy,
who was my last dog.

51:23.969 --> 51:25.596
But after he died, that was it.

51:26.838 --> 51:28.271
God, I think that's all my pets.

51:28.907 --> 51:30.272
You should get some sleep.

51:30.342 --> 51:32.037
Mmm... thank you.

51:36.148 --> 51:37.376
Good morning.

51:37.449 --> 51:39.644
- The time is 7 A.M.
- You have a busy day in front of you...

51:39.718 --> 51:41.185
- Good morning, everyone.
- so I thought you might like to hear...

51:41.253 --> 51:43.517
all my favorite colors
and numbers.

51:43.588 --> 51:47.115
- Blue, seven, seventeen...
- Good morning, everyone! Well...

51:47.192 --> 51:51.629
Lime green, forest green,
yellow, one, blue.

51:51.696 --> 51:53.630
Oh, crap,
did I already say blue?

51:53.698 --> 51:55.723
You know what?
I'm gonna start over.

51:56.268 --> 51:57.963
- Blue.
- Ow!

51:58.036 --> 52:00.027
Oh, God!

52:01.239 --> 52:03.537
Gettin' tired? Unable to
function?

52:04.543 --> 52:05.635
I'm fine.

52:05.710 --> 52:06.677
You know,
you really should think...

52:06.745 --> 52:08.076
about what you're
getting into here.

52:08.146 --> 52:09.113
I don't need sleep.

52:09.181 --> 52:11.240
I can hound you
every second of every day.

52:11.316 --> 52:12.283
You're never gonna know...

52:12.350 --> 52:13.817
if something you hear
is real or not.

52:13.885 --> 52:15.716
I can keep you
from sleeping and eating...

52:15.787 --> 52:17.118
- and drinking...
- Enough!

52:17.189 --> 52:19.680
Enough, okay?
Congratulations, you win.

52:21.493 --> 52:23.518
I love spending time with Henry,
but it's not worth it.

52:24.963 --> 52:27.329
Good.
Then my work here is done.

52:28.567 --> 52:29.829
But if you ever try
to see him again...

52:29.901 --> 52:31.528
- You'll be back.
- You can count on it.

52:31.603 --> 52:32.627
Go.

52:33.805 --> 52:34.829
Hey, wait, Kate.

52:35.841 --> 52:37.069
Look, is there, um...

52:37.909 --> 52:39.376
Is there anything
you wanna tell him?

52:40.011 --> 52:40.978
What do you mean?

52:41.046 --> 52:42.809
Well, Henry came to me...

52:42.881 --> 52:44.143
because he wanted
to talk to you...

52:44.216 --> 52:47.049
and I definitely think
I can deliver on that.

52:48.520 --> 52:49.817
So is there anything
you wanna say to him?

52:53.191 --> 52:55.921
Kate contacted me from beyond...

52:56.895 --> 52:59.329
not like before, but clearer.

52:59.898 --> 53:02.093
Clearer than anything
that I have ever experienced.

53:02.167 --> 53:03.259
What did she say?

53:05.036 --> 53:06.503
Hi, Henry.

53:09.274 --> 53:11.333
She says, "Hi, Henry."

53:13.011 --> 53:15.172
I know. Um, you know what?

53:16.314 --> 53:18.009
Ask me questions.

53:18.083 --> 53:22.747
Just, uh, ask me as
many questions as you'd like...

53:22.821 --> 53:24.880
and just keep asking me
until you're convinced.

53:26.024 --> 53:27.218
What was her favorite food?

53:28.560 --> 53:30.494
The three berry cake
at Sweet Lady Jane's.

53:30.562 --> 53:32.325
She says ask a tough one.

53:33.064 --> 53:36.397
Um, what was
her first pet's name?

53:36.468 --> 53:38.902
Ernie the turtle.
She told me that earlier today.

53:40.739 --> 53:42.070
Her favorite Hawaiian island?

53:44.242 --> 53:47.700
She's only been to Maui, and
she got stung by a jellyfish.

53:49.748 --> 53:50.976
You really, uh...

53:52.951 --> 53:53.975
What else?

53:55.654 --> 53:56.882
She always hated this chair.

53:56.955 --> 54:00.015
Her second toes are slightly
longer than her first.

54:00.091 --> 54:01.718
She always meant
to take guitar lessons.

54:01.793 --> 54:04.227
Well, I...
Why did she come here?

54:04.296 --> 54:05.888
I mean, what does
she wanna tell me?

54:07.966 --> 54:09.524
She says that she can tell
that you're torn...

54:09.601 --> 54:11.398
between being faithful
to her memory...

54:11.469 --> 54:13.198
and the feelings
that you have for me.

54:14.139 --> 54:15.265
The hell I did!

54:16.007 --> 54:18.339
Ow! Oh! Ah!

54:18.410 --> 54:20.640
- What happened?
- Seed in the eye! It's okay!

54:20.712 --> 54:22.179
Tell him the truth!

54:22.247 --> 54:24.681
She says she just wants you
to be happy, Henry...

54:24.749 --> 54:27.115
and she can tell
that you're happier with me.

54:28.053 --> 54:30.248
You are screwing
with the wrong woman.

54:30.322 --> 54:32.688
That's it. I mean,
she wants you to move on.

54:32.757 --> 54:34.748
Oh, she's gone.

54:34.826 --> 54:35.793
No, I'm not!

54:35.860 --> 54:37.054
I'm right here!

54:37.128 --> 54:38.686
I'm right here!

54:38.763 --> 54:40.993
I'm gonna be with you
every second of every day...

54:41.066 --> 54:42.294
for the rest of your life!

54:42.367 --> 54:43.334
Tell her thank you.

54:43.401 --> 54:45.926
Thank you, Kate,
wherever you are.

54:46.905 --> 54:47.872
Are you okay?

54:47.939 --> 54:49.930
You look at it, Doctor.

54:50.008 --> 54:51.032
Oh!

54:51.843 --> 54:52.810
It really hurts.

54:52.877 --> 54:54.640
Good. I hope it blinds you.

54:56.348 --> 54:57.781
What would I do without you?

54:59.084 --> 55:01.348
You are so dead.

55:01.419 --> 55:04.479
I, Andy Chris, take you,
Natalia Yeroshik...

55:04.556 --> 55:06.023
as my best friend for life.

55:06.091 --> 55:08.025
I pledge to honor, encourage...

55:08.093 --> 55:09.651
- and support you...
- Oh, you know the Lerner party?

55:09.728 --> 55:11.218
You're gonna have
to do that alone.

55:11.296 --> 55:15.460
Where, uh...
Where are you gonna be?

55:15.533 --> 55:17.467
Uh, I gotta... I gotta...

55:17.535 --> 55:20.595
I gotta go away. I'm...
Some... I've got a thing.

55:20.672 --> 55:21.696
With... With who?

55:22.941 --> 55:23.908
Shh.

55:23.975 --> 55:26.671
With Henry? With Henry.

55:26.745 --> 55:28.337
This is my solemn vow.

55:28.413 --> 55:32.372
From this moment,
I, Natalia Yeroshik...

55:32.450 --> 55:33.417
take you, Andy Chris...

55:33.485 --> 55:36.010
- What, Dan?
- Nothing. Nothing.

55:36.087 --> 55:37.850
This is my solemn vow.

55:37.922 --> 55:39.651
By the power vested in me...

55:39.724 --> 55:42.921
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

55:42.994 --> 55:44.393
You may kiss the bride.

55:44.462 --> 55:46.020
Congratulations.

55:46.097 --> 55:47.064
Yeah.

55:47.132 --> 55:48.156
Yeah.

55:50.935 --> 55:52.732
Three...

55:52.804 --> 55:54.465
four...

55:54.539 --> 55:56.063
five...

55:56.141 --> 55:57.108
- six.
- Ashley.

55:57.175 --> 55:59.336
Shh!

55:59.411 --> 56:01.436
Okay, where was I? I was on...

56:01.513 --> 56:03.276
- Three.
- Thank you.

56:03.348 --> 56:04.679
For what?

56:04.749 --> 56:08.708
Three, four, five...

56:08.787 --> 56:13.190
six, seven, eight.

56:15.026 --> 56:15.993
I have to say something.

56:16.061 --> 56:19.053
Now, you know I never get
involved in your love life.

56:19.130 --> 56:20.222
- Bullshit.
- Fine.

56:20.298 --> 56:22.027
As someone who's always involved
in your love life...

56:22.100 --> 56:23.192
I think you should listen to me.

56:23.268 --> 56:24.826
You're making a huge mistake.

56:24.903 --> 56:26.234
No, I'm not.
Help me with the cart.

56:26.304 --> 56:29.603
Okay, it's... It's not because
his fiancée's ghost...

56:29.674 --> 56:32.108
is trying to drive you away,
and-and it's not because...

56:32.177 --> 56:34.168
he's a client who you lie to...

56:34.245 --> 56:36.372
but you talk about picking guys
with problems?

56:36.448 --> 56:37.608
He just got out
of a relationship...

56:37.682 --> 56:39.673
where his bride was killed
on their wedding day...

56:39.751 --> 56:41.514
and you'll be the first girl
he dates.

56:41.586 --> 56:43.611
That's a pretty serious rebound.

56:43.688 --> 56:45.679
You really think
this is gonna end up well, huh?

56:46.624 --> 56:49.149
Nice try. You're still handling
the Lerner party alone.

56:50.762 --> 56:53.287
Ladies and gentlemen,
Cherries Jubilee.

57:04.542 --> 57:06.510
Excuse me for a second.

57:07.045 --> 57:08.842
I could feel the heat
all the way back here.

57:08.913 --> 57:10.278
- Are you okay?
- You know, if I were dead...

57:10.348 --> 57:12.578
I wouldn't be following around
one person, okay?

57:12.650 --> 57:14.379
I'd be finding out
the meaning of life.

57:14.452 --> 57:16.977
I would be talking to wise,
notable dead people.

57:17.055 --> 57:18.079
Oh, like who?

57:18.156 --> 57:20.386
Um, like Eleanor Roosevelt.

57:20.458 --> 57:21.425
What would you ask her?

57:21.493 --> 57:22.755
Like, all kinds of things.

57:22.827 --> 57:23.851
Like what?

57:23.928 --> 57:25.395
Um...

57:25.463 --> 57:26.430
All right,
forget Eleanor Roosevelt.

57:26.498 --> 57:28.159
You're the only dead person
I wanna talk to right now.

57:28.233 --> 57:30.599
Oh, I think you burned off
a little bit of your eyebrow.

57:30.668 --> 57:32.226
What? Where?

57:32.303 --> 57:33.361
Right... Right there.

57:35.140 --> 57:36.266
It's not gonna be even.

57:37.275 --> 57:38.299
You know what? I don't care.

57:38.376 --> 57:39.400
And you know what else?

57:39.477 --> 57:40.739
I'm going away with Henry
this weekend...

57:40.812 --> 57:42.609
whether you like it or not,
and I don't care what you do.

57:42.680 --> 57:45.114
I don't care if you set me
on fire or yell and scream...

57:45.183 --> 57:47.174
and talk about your dog
or watch me while I piss!

57:47.252 --> 57:49.243
I don't care! So if you're
trying to make me look insane...

57:49.320 --> 57:50.514
it's not working!

57:54.359 --> 57:55.383
So...

57:56.628 --> 57:58.289
who's ready for cake?

57:59.798 --> 58:00.822
Oy.

58:01.800 --> 58:05.099
# I'll stop the world
and melt with you #

58:07.872 --> 58:09.737
# You've seen the difference #

58:09.808 --> 58:13.938
# And it's getting better
all the time #

58:14.012 --> 58:15.348
# There's nothing you and I #

58:15.349 --> 58:16.037
- Ha! No!
- Yeah.

58:16.114 --> 58:17.138
- # Won't do #
- Oh, my God.

58:17.215 --> 58:19.410
- Pretty smooth.
- It is beautiful.

58:19.484 --> 58:21.111
It's so weird
how much this place...

58:21.186 --> 58:23.120
reminds me of my own apartment.

58:25.223 --> 58:26.417
You know what we should do?

58:26.491 --> 58:27.583
I saw some people
riding one of those...

58:27.659 --> 58:28.921
like, two-person bikes.

58:28.993 --> 58:30.551
We should totally rent
one of those.

58:30.628 --> 58:31.686
Yeah, absolutely.

58:31.763 --> 58:32.821
Okay, cool.

58:33.998 --> 58:35.226
Now?

58:35.300 --> 58:37.029
Yeah, why not?

58:37.101 --> 58:38.568
We just got here.

58:38.636 --> 58:40.729
Don't you want to unpack,
check out the room?

58:43.675 --> 58:46.007
Oh, my God.

58:46.077 --> 58:47.305
Did you think
that you could just bring me...

58:47.378 --> 58:48.811
up here and never leave
the room?

58:48.880 --> 58:50.780
Just put a "do not disturb" sign
on the door...

58:50.849 --> 58:52.373
and lock ourselves
in for the weekend?

58:52.450 --> 58:53.917
Um... yes?

58:53.985 --> 58:55.247
Awesome.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.651
I'll go freshen up.

59:46.237 --> 59:47.261
Henry?

59:48.506 --> 59:49.905
Yes?

59:49.974 --> 59:51.908
You know I'm still
in the room, right?

59:51.976 --> 59:53.273
Yeah.

59:55.647 --> 59:57.615
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:15.533 --> 01:00:16.557
That was gross.

01:00:17.802 --> 01:00:18.860
Are you all right?

01:00:19.904 --> 01:00:21.098
I'm fine!

01:00:22.273 --> 01:00:23.297
Okay.

01:00:26.544 --> 01:00:27.943
I should've known it was you.

01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:29.138
You know, I never thought
farts were funny...

01:00:29.213 --> 01:00:31.841
when I was alive,
but the look on your face.

01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:33.213
You get out of here.

01:00:34.719 --> 01:00:36.482
You're not having sex
with my husband.

01:00:37.655 --> 01:00:38.622
He is not your husband.

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:40.282
And even if you did make it
down that aisle...

01:00:40.358 --> 01:00:43.225
there's still that
"till death do us part" clause.

01:00:43.294 --> 01:00:44.591
You're a ghost!

01:00:44.662 --> 01:00:45.788
Did you say something?

01:00:46.898 --> 01:00:47.922
Yeah. The...

01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:51.464
There's potpourri!

01:00:51.536 --> 01:00:52.833
Don't do it!

01:00:54.605 --> 01:00:55.663
Oh, I'm doin' it.

01:01:02.613 --> 01:01:04.103
Oh, my God.

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:06.776
It looks even better
on the floor.

01:01:08.686 --> 01:01:10.313
Best day ever.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.824
Wow, this is gonna be awkward.

01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:25.095
Oh, my God!

01:01:26.571 --> 01:01:27.697
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:27.772 --> 01:01:29.763
I just, you know,
it's just, "Oh, my God."

01:01:31.776 --> 01:01:33.869
I'm surprised he didn't spring
for the suite.

01:01:35.346 --> 01:01:36.745
- Hey!
- Are you sure you're okay?

01:01:36.814 --> 01:01:38.111
- How's it going down there?
- Why? Yeah.

01:01:38.182 --> 01:01:39.410
- Yeah.
- Yoo-hoo!

01:01:39.484 --> 01:01:41.679
It's just you're closing
your eyes very energetically.

01:01:41.753 --> 01:01:42.720
I think you're freakin' him out.

01:01:42.787 --> 01:01:44.812
Oh, you like to kiss with
your eyes open? That's cool.

01:01:44.889 --> 01:01:46.220
I mean, that's kind of kinky,
but all right, all right.

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.450
- I'm cool with that.
- Being on the bottom...

01:01:47.525 --> 01:01:48.787
not your most flattering angle.

01:01:50.194 --> 01:01:51.559
I was talking to another ghost
the other day...

01:01:51.629 --> 01:01:53.358
and you'll never guess
who it was.

01:01:53.431 --> 01:01:54.523
Remember that guy you
used to date in high school...

01:01:54.599 --> 01:01:56.396
who got killed
in a motorcycle accident?

01:01:56.467 --> 01:01:57.525
Ted?

01:01:57.602 --> 01:01:58.864
- What?
- What?

01:01:58.936 --> 01:02:00.267
You said Ted.

01:02:00.338 --> 01:02:01.805
No, I didn't.

01:02:01.873 --> 01:02:04.034
I just... I, um...
'cause I bumped my arm.

01:02:04.108 --> 01:02:05.075
I'm okay now.

01:02:05.143 --> 01:02:07.202
Anyway, this is
a little embarrassing...

01:02:07.278 --> 01:02:09.371
but he said
you were a bad kisser.

01:02:09.447 --> 01:02:11.745
Actually, he said you were
the worst kisser ever.

01:02:11.816 --> 01:02:13.443
"Painful and overly wet,"
was his exact quote.

01:02:13.518 --> 01:02:15.509
He made a noise like this.

01:02:15.586 --> 01:02:17.213
- Talk dirty to me.
- What?

01:02:17.288 --> 01:02:19.119
Talk dirty to me.
I love it. It turns me on.

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:20.452
Henry doesn't like that.

01:02:20.525 --> 01:02:21.685
Do it loud.

01:02:21.759 --> 01:02:24.557
Um... Oh, you're a dirty girl,
aren't you?

01:02:24.629 --> 01:02:25.960
She's a dirty little liar
is what she is.

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:27.588
Louder.

01:02:27.665 --> 01:02:29.462
You're a dirty little thing.

01:02:29.534 --> 01:02:30.523
You're a dirty girl...

01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:32.466
- # I believe the children #
- aren't you?

01:02:32.537 --> 01:02:33.936
- # Are our future #
- You're a dirty girl.

01:02:34.005 --> 01:02:35.370
- Good, good. Louder though, louder.
- # Teach them well #

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.100
Like... Like you're trying to
drown out some annoying noise

01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:37.874
# And let them lead the way #

01:02:37.942 --> 01:02:39.136
- # Show them all #
- Like this?!

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.199
- # The beauty #
- Yeah!

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:42.007
- # They possess inside #
- You're a dirty little girl, aren't you?

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.911
- Louder, please!
- Aren't you a dirty little thing?!

01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:45.005
You like the dirty stuff!

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.074
Aren't you a dirty...
That's just stupid.

01:02:47.151 --> 01:02:48.277
I'm just yelling at you.

01:02:50.988 --> 01:02:52.512
- Music!
- Is that annoying?

01:02:56.794 --> 01:02:57.988
It's a little loud.

01:02:58.062 --> 01:02:59.188
What?!

01:02:59.263 --> 01:03:00.753
The music.
You like it this loud?

01:03:00.832 --> 01:03:01.856
Oh, yeah, I love it.

01:03:01.933 --> 01:03:03.628
Love this. Salsa.

01:03:03.701 --> 01:03:05.692
Salsa makes me horny!

01:03:10.808 --> 01:03:12.241
No, no, no, no!

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:13.504
Come on, just anything.

01:03:13.578 --> 01:03:14.545
I like your hair!

01:03:14.612 --> 01:03:15.738
Oh, God, I love it!

01:03:15.813 --> 01:03:17.337
- It's looks really good!
- Louder!

01:03:17.415 --> 01:03:18.507
Really?!

01:03:21.452 --> 01:03:22.749
Sorry, sorry.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.117
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

01:03:24.188 --> 01:03:25.655
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

01:03:26.491 --> 01:03:27.719
So, what's up?

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:29.419
You know that woman
you sent me to...

01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:31.018
the, uh, psychic?

01:03:31.095 --> 01:03:32.119
Believe me, you don't have
to whisper that...

01:03:32.196 --> 01:03:33.163
in this neighborhood.

01:03:33.231 --> 01:03:34.493
I mean, it's not like
I sent you to a...

01:03:35.933 --> 01:03:36.991
Republican.

01:03:38.369 --> 01:03:40.735
Well, She's, um... She's great.

01:03:40.805 --> 01:03:43.000
I mean, really, I feel
a thousand times better.

01:03:43.074 --> 01:03:45.167
Did she get a message from Kate?

01:03:45.243 --> 01:03:47.336
Yeah, and I think that Kate
really wants me to move on.

01:03:48.446 --> 01:03:49.538
In fact, I'm dating her.

01:03:50.248 --> 01:03:51.215
Who?

01:03:51.282 --> 01:03:52.442
Ashley.

01:03:52.517 --> 01:03:53.984
Wait, so she told you
that Kate said...

01:03:54.051 --> 01:03:55.746
that she wants you
to start dating again...

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.754
and then she went out with you?

01:03:57.822 --> 01:03:59.414
Well, it didn't happen
exactly like that, but...

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.355
Oh, yeah,
I guess that is...

01:04:01.425 --> 01:04:02.585
how it happened exactly, but...

01:04:03.261 --> 01:04:04.285
Well, you got to stop.

01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:05.659
Why?

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:06.924
She's a psychic.

01:04:06.998 --> 01:04:08.556
Since when do you have
a problem with psychics?

01:04:08.633 --> 01:04:09.691
I... You do.

01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.200
You do. You hate them.

01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:12.793
Look, Henry,
I think it's great...

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:16.499
that you're dating again,
but, I mean, you can't date her.

01:04:17.241 --> 01:04:19.732
God, I thought
you'd be happy about this.

01:04:20.745 --> 01:04:22.337
I guess, I-I should be.

01:04:22.413 --> 01:04:24.881
I'm just... You're right.

01:04:24.949 --> 01:04:26.541
I'm just surprised, I mean...

01:04:26.617 --> 01:04:28.676
But I'm... I'm...
I'm coming around now.

01:04:30.087 --> 01:04:33.318
I mean, look how happy I am now.

01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:34.358
Chloe.

01:04:34.425 --> 01:04:35.619
I've been meaning
to call you, actually.

01:04:35.693 --> 01:04:36.887
What's been stopping you, huh?

01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:38.622
Pretending to talk
to my brother's dead fiancée...

01:04:38.696 --> 01:04:39.663
so you could date him?

01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:40.992
Come on in.

01:04:41.065 --> 01:04:42.498
No, I'm okay.

01:04:42.567 --> 01:04:44.831
I just...
I want Kate's diary back.

01:04:44.902 --> 01:04:47.598
Okay. Um... yeah.

01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:55.609
I'm not gonna tell him
that I gave this to you...

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.171
because, somehow,
he does seem better.

01:04:58.249 --> 01:04:59.341
I know it looks bad.

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:00.543
How could you do this?

01:05:00.618 --> 01:05:03.416
I mean, uh, "I can't fake it.
I'm not some scam artist."

01:05:03.487 --> 01:05:05.079
I mean, you totally
took advantage of him.

01:05:05.156 --> 01:05:06.123
You asked me to do this.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.021
Use fake psychic vision
to date him?

01:05:08.092 --> 01:05:10.117
Let me think.
No, I'd remember that.

01:05:11.162 --> 01:05:13.653
Chloe, I really, really care
about him.

01:05:13.731 --> 01:05:15.062
Worst part is that I did this.

01:05:15.132 --> 01:05:17.191
I mean, I gave this to you.

01:05:17.268 --> 01:05:19.327
I handed you everything
that you needed.

01:05:19.403 --> 01:05:20.597
You gave what to her?

01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:22.639
No, what...
It's okay. Don't...

01:05:23.407 --> 01:05:24.431
What's this?

01:05:27.378 --> 01:05:28.470
This is Kate's diary.

01:05:29.146 --> 01:05:30.113
Yeah.

01:05:30.181 --> 01:05:31.239
Why would you give this to her?

01:05:32.149 --> 01:05:33.343
How'd you even get it?

01:05:38.723 --> 01:05:40.213
The story about the pancreas
is in here...

01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:41.918
- Um...
- and how we met.

01:05:47.665 --> 01:05:49.030
Henry. Henry!

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.124
Henry!

01:05:57.808 --> 01:05:59.833
You were right.

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:04.074
It all fell apart, you know,
'cause I'm a horrible person.

01:06:04.148 --> 01:06:06.275
No, no, you're not
a horrible person.

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:09.376
Yes, I am. I am.

01:06:09.453 --> 01:06:12.354
I'm a liar,
and I'm a horrible person.

01:06:12.423 --> 01:06:14.914
And you know what?
I never even deserved him.

01:06:14.992 --> 01:06:16.220
- Okay, you... You kn...
- I didn't!

01:06:16.294 --> 01:06:18.285
No, you know what?
He's an idiot to let you go.

01:06:18.362 --> 01:06:19.351
- No!
- All right? No.

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:21.796
No matter what you did,
he's an idiot to let you go...

01:06:21.866 --> 01:06:22.924
okay?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.729
Anyone would be lucky
to have you.

01:06:24.802 --> 01:06:26.201
You're just saying that.

01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:27.464
Anyone.

01:06:38.182 --> 01:06:39.308
What the hell was that?

01:06:39.383 --> 01:06:40.645
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:40.718 --> 01:06:42.049
You're my friend.

01:06:42.119 --> 01:06:43.086
You're gay.

01:06:43.154 --> 01:06:44.212
You're my gay friend.

01:06:45.323 --> 01:06:47.052
Ah, screw it.

01:06:47.124 --> 01:06:48.648
I'm not gay.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.727
What?

01:06:50.795 --> 01:06:52.228
I'm not gay!

01:06:52.296 --> 01:06:53.991
I've never been gay.

01:06:54.065 --> 01:06:57.364
I don't have sex with men,
and they don't have sex with me.

01:06:57.435 --> 01:06:58.925
Wow.

01:06:59.003 --> 01:07:01.995
So when you just kissed me
just then, you were like...

01:07:02.073 --> 01:07:03.563
I'm in love with you.

01:07:03.641 --> 01:07:04.699
What?!

01:07:04.775 --> 01:07:06.299
I've been in love with you
since I met you.

01:07:06.377 --> 01:07:08.971
Every time you turn your back
to me, I sniff your hair.

01:07:09.046 --> 01:07:11.480
I went into business with you,
so I could be near you.

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:12.538
I hate cooking!

01:07:12.616 --> 01:07:14.709
I wanna throw up
every time I cut a fish.

01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:16.753
God, you have got to be
the worst psychic...

01:07:16.821 --> 01:07:17.788
in the history of time.

01:07:17.855 --> 01:07:19.379
How could you not know
any of this?

01:07:19.457 --> 01:07:21.982
Why didn't you just,
like, tell me?

01:07:22.059 --> 01:07:24.994
Okay, remember when we met,

01:07:25.062 --> 01:07:26.893
and-and-and
we started, you know...

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:28.522
going out to lunch and dinner...

01:07:28.599 --> 01:07:33.662
and talking on the phone
all day and all night.

01:07:33.738 --> 01:07:34.898
I thought we were dating.

01:07:36.073 --> 01:07:37.370
And... And then...

01:07:37.441 --> 01:07:40.535
And then, after a week,
we went to a movie.

01:07:40.611 --> 01:07:44.445
I was just about to kiss you,
and you turned to me...

01:07:44.515 --> 01:07:49.714
and you said, "I love having
a gay friend to talk to.

01:07:49.787 --> 01:07:51.049
"I could never be
this comfortable...

01:07:51.122 --> 01:07:52.248
"with a straight man."

01:07:56.627 --> 01:07:58.788
What was...
What was I supposed to do?

01:07:58.863 --> 01:08:00.854
You waited a week
to make your move!

01:08:00.931 --> 01:08:02.455
Of course,
I thought you were gay.

01:08:02.533 --> 01:08:03.500
I was taking it slow.

01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:06.127
Five years, one kiss?
That's not slow.

01:08:06.203 --> 01:08:07.261
That's family.

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:08.703
I'm sorry.
I missed my window.

01:08:08.773 --> 01:08:11.469
I was... I was waiting for it
to come back around again.

01:08:12.209 --> 01:08:13.801
God, Dan, you've, like...

01:08:15.546 --> 01:08:16.706
betrayed me.

01:08:16.781 --> 01:08:18.715
- Betrayed you?
- Yeah.

01:08:18.783 --> 01:08:20.546
Ashley, I love you.

01:08:20.618 --> 01:08:22.676
You think it was easy for me
listening to you...

01:08:22.752 --> 01:08:24.653
talk about other guys, huh?

01:08:24.721 --> 01:08:27.850
Watching mind-numbingly
boring romantic movies...

01:08:27.925 --> 01:08:29.153
and pretending to cry?

01:08:29.225 --> 01:08:31.888
Going shopping with you and
giving you advice on clothes?

01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:34.157
Do you know how much
of the last five years...

01:08:34.231 --> 01:08:36.131
I have spent
learning about clothes?

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.432
This shirt cost me $175,
and I hate it!

01:08:40.504 --> 01:08:41.493
I hate it!

01:08:41.572 --> 01:08:42.765
I love that shirt.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.330
You know, before
this whole stupid thing...

01:08:44.408 --> 01:08:46.774
I probably spent
$100 a year on clothes.

01:08:46.844 --> 01:08:49.038
Now? Now, I spend that much
every three weeks...

01:08:49.113 --> 01:08:51.546
on this haircut,
which I also hate!

01:08:54.852 --> 01:08:56.149
God.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.484
We took bubble baths together.

01:08:58.555 --> 01:08:59.523
Yeah.

01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:01.455
Now can you see
how hard it was for me?

01:09:04.295 --> 01:09:08.322
I just wanted to cry
on my gay friend.

01:09:14.138 --> 01:09:15.162
Yup.

01:09:27.017 --> 01:09:28.211
I'll let myself out.

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.648
Okay.

01:09:46.904 --> 01:09:48.701
All right, I'm ready.

01:09:50.508 --> 01:09:52.135
You don't have a cat.

01:09:52.209 --> 01:09:54.473
I rescued a stray,
so you'd talk to me.

01:09:57.648 --> 01:09:58.672
Come in.

01:10:02.786 --> 01:10:04.515
So, have you thought
about a name for him yet?

01:10:04.588 --> 01:10:05.782
No. After we're done here...

01:10:05.856 --> 01:10:07.517
I'm taking him
back to the pound.

01:10:08.993 --> 01:10:10.255
I'm kidding.

01:10:10.327 --> 01:10:13.455
It's a joke,
so you start laughing now...

01:10:13.531 --> 01:10:16.967
breaks the tension,
and then we start talking again.

01:10:17.034 --> 01:10:18.467
Pet's a big responsibility.

01:10:18.536 --> 01:10:19.833
Did you ever think
about maybe just running...

01:10:19.904 --> 01:10:20.871
into me on the street?

01:10:20.938 --> 01:10:22.769
Listen, I didn't know
that Ashley was gonna use...

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.740
the information I gave her
to start dating you.

01:10:24.808 --> 01:10:26.503
I mean, I really thought
that she was just...

01:10:26.577 --> 01:10:28.340
gonna tell you that Kate
wanted you to move on.

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:34.379
We... Do you
really have to do that?

01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:35.713
Yeah, he needs his shots.

01:10:36.487 --> 01:10:39.786
Yeah.
I think he's already had them.

01:10:40.658 --> 01:10:42.285
He's my neighbor's cat.

01:10:42.927 --> 01:10:45.088
Your neighbor let you borrow
her cat to bring to the vet?

01:10:46.697 --> 01:10:47.721
You stole a cat?

01:10:47.798 --> 01:10:49.265
I'm gonna bring him back.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.233
He was on a fire escape.
It's like a walk.

01:10:51.302 --> 01:10:52.564
Would you quit doin'
stupid stuff...

01:10:52.636 --> 01:10:54.035
because you think you know
you're right?

01:10:54.104 --> 01:10:55.799
Whoa. You should hear yourself.

01:10:55.873 --> 01:10:56.965
You sound like Mom and Dad.

01:10:57.041 --> 01:10:58.668
And your friends
and your bosses...

01:10:58.742 --> 01:11:00.903
and your teachers and strangers
that you meet on the street.

01:11:00.978 --> 01:11:03.310
They all tell you this
because it's true.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:04.938
I'm sorry you feel that way.

01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:06.949
See if you can get the cat home
without killing it.

01:11:07.017 --> 01:11:08.245
I think I can handle it.

01:11:15.593 --> 01:11:16.617
He's fine.

01:11:26.904 --> 01:11:27.928
Hi.

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:31.240
I read this.

01:11:31.308 --> 01:11:33.208
Henry, I really wanna talk
to you about all this.

01:11:33.277 --> 01:11:34.244
- It's just...
- How did you know...

01:11:34.311 --> 01:11:37.075
about the cake
or Hawaii or the chair?

01:11:37.147 --> 01:11:38.114
None of that's in here...

01:11:38.182 --> 01:11:39.479
and no one else
knows about that.

01:11:40.584 --> 01:11:44.350
All right, um,
your sister gave me the diary...

01:11:44.421 --> 01:11:45.888
and she asked me to pretend...

01:11:45.956 --> 01:11:48.652
that Kate had talked to me,
which is not her fault...

01:11:48.726 --> 01:11:50.717
because I shouldn't have done it
in the first place, okay?

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:55.631
But I did, because
I thought, I don't know...

01:11:55.699 --> 01:11:58.327
I thought maybe you needed it,
you know, to help you move on.

01:12:00.771 --> 01:12:03.069
But I must have crossed
over some sort of line...

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:06.906
or something, because
then, suddenly, she appeared.

01:12:06.977 --> 01:12:08.171
- Kate.
- Yeah.

01:12:08.245 --> 01:12:12.682
And sh... And she tried
to scare me away from you.

01:12:13.484 --> 01:12:18.649
But I just... I really
wanted to be with you...

01:12:18.722 --> 01:12:20.656
so I didn't let it stop me.

01:12:20.724 --> 01:12:23.284
You pretended that
she wanted us to be together...

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.850
because you thought that
that would make me...

01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:26.020
fall in love with you.

01:12:28.932 --> 01:12:30.160
Yeah, I guess I did.

01:12:30.968 --> 01:12:32.333
I, um...

01:12:32.403 --> 01:12:37.033
I hoped that you would love me
for other reasons, too.

01:12:40.044 --> 01:12:42.205
- Is she here now?
- No, I haven't...

01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:45.680
I haven't actually seen her,
um, since you broke up with me.

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:49.614
Guess it was her job
to get rid of me...

01:12:49.687 --> 01:12:51.746
and, well, she did that.

01:12:53.323 --> 01:12:55.382
So, she just sort of disappears?

01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:56.858
I don't know.

01:13:01.165 --> 01:13:02.189
Thank you.

01:13:15.145 --> 01:13:19.047
"There's a soul
and seal on thine arm.

01:13:19.116 --> 01:13:21.243

# When everything is wrong #

01:13:48.145 --> 01:13:50.579
- # We move along #
- Come on.

01:13:51.582 --> 01:13:54.608
- Okay. Good night, Bill.
- # When all you gotta keep #

01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:55.674
- Oh, you're a vet.
- # Is strong #

01:13:55.753 --> 01:13:56.516
# Move along, move along #

01:13:56.517 --> 01:13:57.983
You know, I've always
wondered which is smarter...

01:13:58.055 --> 01:13:59.955
- cats or dogs.
- # Like I know you do #

01:14:00.023 --> 01:14:01.547
Come in for some coffee?

01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:02.887
# When all you gotta #

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.928
- # Keep is strong #
- Why... I really have to get up early...

01:14:04.995 --> 01:14:06.986
- # Move along, move along #
- but if you insist...

01:14:07.064 --> 01:14:08.964
- # Like I know you do #
- maybe just one cup.

01:14:09.032 --> 01:14:10.897
Cats are really good
with tools...

01:14:10.968 --> 01:14:13.664
- # When all you gotta keep is strong #
- but dogs are better spellers.

01:14:13.737 --> 01:14:15.637
- # Move along, move along #
- That's a... a joke.

01:14:15.706 --> 01:14:17.537
- # Like I know you do #
- Dogs, actually.

01:14:18.909 --> 01:14:20.968
- That's a funny trick.
- # When all you gotta keep #

01:14:21.044 --> 01:14:22.705
- Is there something wrong with cats?
- # Is strong #

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.270
- No, cats are great.
- # Move along, move along #

01:14:24.348 --> 01:14:27.112
- Their owners are nuts.
- # Like I know you do #

01:14:28.218 --> 01:14:29.981
- # When all you gotta keep #
- How many cats do you have?

01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:31.145
- # Is strong #
- Four.

01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:33.519
- I'll call you, okay?
- # Move along, move along #

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:36.491
- Peace.
- # Like I know you do #

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.584
Do you wanna go
to the restaurant?

01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:38.958
- I mean, I can take you back now.
- # And even when your hope #

01:14:39.029 --> 01:14:42.396
# Is gone,
move along, move along #

01:14:42.466 --> 01:14:44.866
- # Just to make it through #
- Okay.

01:14:45.969 --> 01:14:49.097
# When all you gotta keep
is strong #

01:14:49.173 --> 01:14:51.107
# Move along, move along #

01:14:51.175 --> 01:14:53.939
# Like I know you do #

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:58.311
# Go on, go on, go on, go on #

01:14:58.382 --> 01:15:01.351
# Right back what is wrong #

01:15:01.418 --> 01:15:02.851
# We move along #

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.084
# Go on, go on, go on, go on #

01:15:07.157 --> 01:15:10.024
# Right back what is wrong #

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:11.617
- Ashley.
- # We move along #

01:15:11.695 --> 01:15:14.687
- # Go on, go on, go on, go on #
- Hi.

01:15:14.765 --> 01:15:17.563
- Okay, Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

01:15:17.634 --> 01:15:19.397
- Long time.
- Yeah, could've gone longer.

01:15:19.469 --> 01:15:20.959
Yeah, listen, I've...

01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:22.733
I've been thinking
about what I did, and...

01:15:22.806 --> 01:15:23.966
Can we stop walking?

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:26.009
I'm trying to...
trying to be sincere...

01:15:26.076 --> 01:15:27.703
and the panting
is really killing my delivery.

01:15:27.778 --> 01:15:28.938
Sorry.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.107
- I screwed up.
- Yeah, you did.

01:15:32.182 --> 01:15:33.979
Yeah, I did.
Definitely screwed up.

01:15:34.051 --> 01:15:35.416
But look at it this way.

01:15:35.485 --> 01:15:37.612
I pretended I was gay
for five years.

01:15:37.688 --> 01:15:40.054
Has any other man ever done
anything like that for you, huh?

01:15:40.123 --> 01:15:41.147
I mean,
I could see a guy pretending...

01:15:41.225 --> 01:15:43.557
for two, three...

01:15:43.627 --> 01:15:44.651
- three, three years tops...
- Okay.

01:15:44.728 --> 01:15:46.559
- but five, come on, that's...
- Okay.

01:15:49.166 --> 01:15:52.226
All right, listen, Ashley,
you know me.

01:15:52.302 --> 01:15:54.770
You know me better
than anyone else does.

01:15:55.873 --> 01:15:57.602
And I know you.

01:15:57.674 --> 01:15:59.574
Even though
I did a stupid, stupid...

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:00.610
Really stupid.

01:16:00.677 --> 01:16:04.636
Beyond crazy, stupid thing
by lying to you...

01:16:06.717 --> 01:16:09.117
we have been best friends
for five years.

01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:12.783
Yes, that is true.

01:16:14.691 --> 01:16:15.658
Look, I don't...

01:16:15.726 --> 01:16:18.286
I don't know
any more fancy way to say this.

01:16:20.063 --> 01:16:23.089
I'm a good guy. I love you.

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.634
And I... I just...

01:16:25.702 --> 01:16:28.865
I just really wish
you'd give me a chance, so...

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:35.037
Do I attract
screwed-up guys, or what?

01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:53.553
Hiya.

01:16:55.465 --> 01:16:56.864
- You.
- Yeah.

01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:59.362
Well, he doesn't look so good,
does he?

01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:01.227
No, he doesn't.

01:17:02.239 --> 01:17:04.036
Finish your mission?

01:17:04.107 --> 01:17:05.074
Yeah. You?

01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:07.940
No, or I wouldn't still be here.

01:17:08.011 --> 01:17:09.501
- Really?
- Mm.

01:17:09.579 --> 01:17:11.979
So you do move on
once you finish...

01:17:12.049 --> 01:17:13.914
- what you're supposed to do?
- Oh, shoot.

01:17:13.984 --> 01:17:16.145
Did you listen
to anything she said?

01:17:17.254 --> 01:17:20.018
- No.
- So I guess you're not done yet.

01:17:20.557 --> 01:17:22.081
Guess not.

01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:24.957
Look, what do you think
you're supposed to do?

01:17:26.029 --> 01:17:27.018
I don't know.

01:17:27.097 --> 01:17:30.066
Well, what do you want more
than anything else right now?

01:17:36.974 --> 01:17:37.941
For Henry to be happy.

01:17:38.008 --> 01:17:38.975
Okay.

01:17:39.042 --> 01:17:40.703
What do you think
would make Henry happy?

01:17:46.316 --> 01:17:47.442
I don't know.

01:17:47.517 --> 01:17:48.984
Think you do.

01:17:49.052 --> 01:17:51.384
Damn it! Anything but that.

01:17:53.924 --> 01:17:55.357
Wait, where are you going?

01:17:55.425 --> 01:17:56.949
I'm done.

01:17:57.027 --> 01:17:58.289
So your job was to...

01:17:58.362 --> 01:18:00.296
Get you to do
the right thing, yeah.

01:18:00.364 --> 01:18:02.195
Well, why didn't you just
tell me that in the first place?

01:18:02.265 --> 01:18:04.733
Would you have believed me? Mmm.

01:18:06.003 --> 01:18:07.595
See ya, up there.

01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:09.696
Yeah? Well, if I see you,
I know I'm not in heaven.

01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:11.263
That's the spirit.

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:22.245
The yellow dress?

01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:24.844
Are you planning on wearing
that, or taking it to Goodwill?

01:18:24.921 --> 01:18:26.684
I haven't talked to him
in months.

01:18:26.757 --> 01:18:29.123
Wow. No, "Hello, Kate.

01:18:29.192 --> 01:18:30.784
"How's the afterlife
treatin' you?"

01:18:30.861 --> 01:18:32.260
You know, I think I lost weight.

01:18:32.329 --> 01:18:34.320
I never looked this good
when I was alive.

01:18:34.398 --> 01:18:35.422
What do you want, Kate?

01:18:38.335 --> 01:18:42.294
Um... all right,
this isn't easy for me, so...

01:18:43.206 --> 01:18:45.197
You at a loss for words?

01:18:45.275 --> 01:18:46.640
That's a first.

01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:49.946
Have you talked to Henry,
you know, since...

01:18:50.013 --> 01:18:51.173
Since you broke us up?

01:18:51.248 --> 01:18:52.875
No, I haven't.

01:18:52.949 --> 01:18:55.179
As a matter of fact,
I'm, uh, dating someone else.

01:18:55.886 --> 01:18:56.944
No, you're not. You can't be.

01:18:57.821 --> 01:18:59.550
Yes, I can,
and we're goin' to Vegas.

01:18:59.623 --> 01:19:01.591
Well, stop! What about Henry?

01:19:01.658 --> 01:19:02.750
What about him? You know what?

01:19:02.826 --> 01:19:04.054
I am not interested
in whatever sick game...

01:19:04.127 --> 01:19:05.287
you're playing, Kate.

01:19:05.362 --> 01:19:06.727
No, listen to me.
I'm being very serious.

01:19:06.797 --> 01:19:08.594
I want you two together.

01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:10.860
No sale.

01:19:12.869 --> 01:19:15.099
I can't believe I'm begging you
to date my husband.

01:19:16.106 --> 01:19:18.973
Okay, don't you still love him?

01:19:21.178 --> 01:19:22.839
Even if you weren't
screwing with me right now...

01:19:22.913 --> 01:19:24.847
which it's
so clear that you are...

01:19:24.915 --> 01:19:26.075
the answer would be no.

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:28.408
I moved on.

01:19:30.353 --> 01:19:32.321
I mean, it killed me to do it,
but I did it.

01:19:33.757 --> 01:19:34.781
So just, um...

01:19:36.026 --> 01:19:38.153
Can you leave me alone now?
Please?

01:19:53.477 --> 01:19:54.501
Get up!

01:19:54.578 --> 01:19:55.909
Get up!

01:19:55.979 --> 01:19:56.946
Henry!

01:19:57.013 --> 01:19:58.605
Why can't you hear me?

01:19:58.682 --> 01:20:00.081
Get up!

01:20:02.786 --> 01:20:04.344
Everything okay over there?

01:20:04.421 --> 01:20:05.649
Who cares about the bird?

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:07.656
Call Ashley!

01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:09.248
Ashley. Call Ashley.

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:11.684
Ashley.

01:20:13.897 --> 01:20:14.921
Did you just say...

01:20:14.998 --> 01:20:17.125
- Ashley.
- Who taught you that?

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.929
Call Ashley. Call Ashley.

01:20:19.002 --> 01:20:20.196
You want me to call Ashley?

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:22.295
What do you...
I'm talking to my bird.

01:20:22.372 --> 01:20:23.566
Get up. Get up.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.039
Kate?

01:20:26.776 --> 01:20:27.800
Is that you?

01:20:29.279 --> 01:20:32.146
Are you talking to me
through my bird?

01:20:32.215 --> 01:20:33.307
Yes.

01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:35.318
Why do you want me to...

01:20:35.385 --> 01:20:36.443
Call Ashley.

01:20:48.331 --> 01:20:49.696
I got a machine.

01:20:49.766 --> 01:20:51.825
- Airport.
- What?

01:20:51.902 --> 01:20:52.926
Airport.

01:20:55.872 --> 01:20:56.839
Take the bird.

01:20:56.907 --> 01:20:57.965
Oh, yeah.

01:21:04.247 --> 01:21:06.545
# Think of all the luck
you got #

01:21:07.617 --> 01:21:10.916
- Taxi! Taxi!
- # You know that it's not for naught #

01:21:10.987 --> 01:21:12.955
Oh, hey, nice. Thanks.

01:21:13.023 --> 01:21:14.354
Welcome.

01:21:14.424 --> 01:21:16.619
- # It's not like that anymore #
- Where to?

01:21:16.693 --> 01:21:18.058
Airport. Airport.

01:21:19.663 --> 01:21:20.789
What? You heard the bird.
The airport.

01:21:21.731 --> 01:21:23.323
Why are we going to the airport?
Where is she goin'?

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.560
Las Vegas.

01:21:24.634 --> 01:21:26.158
And you want me to stop her?
I thought you hated her.

01:21:26.236 --> 01:21:27.362
What gave you that idea?

01:21:27.437 --> 01:21:29.166
How do you even...
How do you know this?

01:21:33.643 --> 01:21:34.701
What a day, right?

01:21:36.146 --> 01:21:37.443
Got your bird with you, huh?

01:21:37.514 --> 01:21:39.243
It's actually my, uh, fiancée.

01:21:39.316 --> 01:21:41.716
- # What is this downside #
- Ah.

01:21:41.785 --> 01:21:44.777
- I think.
- # That you speak of? #

01:21:45.689 --> 01:21:47.714
# What is this feeling #

01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:51.955
# You're so #

01:21:52.028 --> 01:21:53.723
# Sure of? #

01:21:57.801 --> 01:22:00.395
# What is this downside #

01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:01.528
Ashley!

01:22:01.605 --> 01:22:03.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back of the line, sir.

01:22:03.373 --> 01:22:04.601
I just need to talk
to that woman for a second.

01:22:04.674 --> 01:22:06.403
The only way you get
through here is with a ticket.

01:22:07.043 --> 01:22:08.408
Could you maybe get her then?

01:22:09.346 --> 01:22:10.438
It's an emergency.

01:22:10.513 --> 01:22:11.810
Oh, it's an emergency?

01:22:11.881 --> 01:22:13.314
Well, by all means,
come on in, man.

01:22:13.383 --> 01:22:14.543
You know,
people who have emergencies...

01:22:14.618 --> 01:22:16.609
don't even have to go
through the metal detectors.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.112
All right, there's
really no need for sarcasm.

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:20.486
Back of the line.

01:22:21.024 --> 01:22:22.855
Hi. I need the cheapest
ticket you have.

01:22:22.926 --> 01:22:23.915
Where do you wanna go, sir?

01:22:23.994 --> 01:22:25.154
It doesn't matter.

01:22:25.228 --> 01:22:27.423
Well, that's not
at all suspicious.

01:22:28.398 --> 01:22:29.422
Hurry up, lard ass.

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:31.467
Excuse me?

01:22:31.534 --> 01:22:33.229
Uh... no, that's, uh...

01:22:33.303 --> 01:22:34.736
That's... That's my bird.

01:22:34.804 --> 01:22:36.271
He says that to everybody.

01:22:37.641 --> 01:22:39.131
Move those fat fingers, Helen.

01:22:40.243 --> 01:22:41.676
All right, you know what?
That's enough.

01:22:41.745 --> 01:22:42.769
Sorry.

01:22:44.414 --> 01:22:48.248
One ticket to Miami, $1,350.

01:22:48.318 --> 01:22:50.980
- That's the cheapest ticket...
- Don't be cheap. Buy it!

01:22:51.054 --> 01:22:52.113
All right, you know,
that's fine. That's fine.

01:22:52.114 --> 01:22:52.248
Buy it!

01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:55.321
You know, I never really
thought about it...

01:22:55.392 --> 01:22:57.758
but, uh, a psychic in Vegas?

01:22:57.827 --> 01:22:59.522
We could really clean up,
you know?

01:22:59.596 --> 01:23:01.223
Yeah.
Too bad I don't do that anymore.

01:23:01.298 --> 01:23:02.265
All right.

01:23:02.332 --> 01:23:03.299
Over there.

01:23:03.366 --> 01:23:04.856
What?

01:23:04.934 --> 01:23:06.231
What's the matter?

01:23:06.303 --> 01:23:07.270
You don't wanna know.

01:23:07.337 --> 01:23:08.599
Ashley.

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:11.164
What are you doing here?

01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:13.402
I don't know.
The bird told me to come here.

01:23:13.476 --> 01:23:14.443
Did you do this?

01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:15.603
Who are you talking to?

01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:17.943
Oh, let me...
Let me guess, uh, the ghost?

01:23:18.014 --> 01:23:18.981
Why are you here?

01:23:19.049 --> 01:23:21.074
Why is your arm around her?
You're gay.

01:23:21.151 --> 01:23:22.743
No, I'm not...
I'm not gay. No, no.

01:23:22.819 --> 01:23:24.150
No, I've never been gay.

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.710
Methinks
he doth protest too much.

01:23:30.293 --> 01:23:31.317
Do you really want this?

01:23:33.997 --> 01:23:35.464
Henry does.

01:23:35.532 --> 01:23:36.499
Where is she?

01:23:36.566 --> 01:23:37.726
She's right next to you.

01:23:42.539 --> 01:23:44.200
You want Ashley and me
to be together?

01:23:46.409 --> 01:23:47.501
I do.

01:23:47.577 --> 01:23:50.341
I'm sorry I put you
through all of this.

01:23:50.413 --> 01:23:52.779
She says she does,
and she's sorry...

01:23:52.849 --> 01:23:54.544
for being such a royal bitch.

01:23:55.352 --> 01:23:57.445
I mean, I'm... I'm paraphrasing.

01:23:59.756 --> 01:24:00.780
Thank you, Kate.

01:24:01.991 --> 01:24:03.185
You're welcome, Henry.

01:24:09.366 --> 01:24:11.197
When we get to heaven,
all bets are off.

01:24:13.436 --> 01:24:14.767
She says you're welcome.

01:24:15.405 --> 01:24:17.737
So, Kate
wants us to be together.

01:24:18.875 --> 01:24:20.342
I want us to be together.

01:24:23.179 --> 01:24:24.203
What do you want?

01:24:26.616 --> 01:24:28.709
Well, I wouldn't
wanna piss her off again.

01:24:29.552 --> 01:24:32.214
# And love #

01:24:32.288 --> 01:24:35.780
# Such a silly game
we play #

01:24:35.859 --> 01:24:38.851
# Oh, like a summer's day
in May #

01:24:38.928 --> 01:24:41.021
# What is love? What is love? #

01:24:41.097 --> 01:24:44.589
- Hello?
- # I just want you to be loved #

01:24:44.667 --> 01:24:46.157
# Oh-oh-oh #

01:24:46.236 --> 01:24:48.431
You know what? That probably
wasn't gonna work out anyway.

01:24:48.505 --> 01:24:49.665
- I'm Bill, by the...
- I'm not gay!

01:24:49.739 --> 01:24:50.706
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:24:50.774 --> 01:24:51.741
- All right.
- Very good.

01:24:51.808 --> 01:24:53.571
Me, neither. Not gay at all.

01:24:53.643 --> 01:24:55.702
Um, maybe, though,
when we get to Vegas...

01:24:55.779 --> 01:24:56.746
we can grab some dinner...

01:24:56.813 --> 01:24:59.611
and talk about how,
you know, not gay we are.

01:25:00.483 --> 01:25:01.973
# Ah, ah, ah #

01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:04.417
# Love #

01:25:04.487 --> 01:25:07.650
# Who could tell me
I am wrong? #

01:25:09.058 --> 01:25:11.049
# I just think
that I am strong #

01:25:11.127 --> 01:25:13.391
# What is love? What is love? #

01:25:13.463 --> 01:25:16.728
# I just want you to be loved #

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.233
# Oh-oh oh-oh #

01:25:18.301 --> 01:25:19.393
# Oh-oh #

01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:27.667
I am so glad I met you.
You're hilarious.

01:25:27.744 --> 01:25:29.541
I was just going
for ironically amusing.

01:25:29.612 --> 01:25:30.943
Are you sure you haven't
been drinking already?

01:25:31.014 --> 01:25:32.641
Oh, wait
till after the ceremony.

01:25:32.715 --> 01:25:33.682
If you like me now...

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:35.581
you are gonna love me
when I'm drunk.

01:25:47.163 --> 01:25:49.188
Wow. That was, um...

01:25:50.066 --> 01:25:51.966
- really quick.
- Well, I'm not gay.

01:25:52.035 --> 01:25:53.662
I'm not gay.

01:25:53.736 --> 01:25:54.703
I just need...
I just wanna get that...

01:25:54.771 --> 01:25:56.534
out there right now, so there's
no misunderstanding later.

01:25:56.606 --> 01:25:59.700
I'm not...
So that's why we, uh... Okay.

01:26:00.844 --> 01:26:01.970
There she is.

01:26:11.855 --> 01:26:12.879
Oh, God, hold on, Dad.

01:26:13.456 --> 01:26:15.117
One second. One second.

01:26:19.429 --> 01:26:20.453
Hi.

01:26:23.266 --> 01:26:25.029
Look, I know
this was supposed to be you...

01:26:26.236 --> 01:26:27.362
so thank you.

01:26:29.806 --> 01:26:31.433
Just make him happy, okay?

01:26:33.576 --> 01:26:34.668
Or else, you know.

01:26:37.046 --> 01:26:39.776
Wait, can you come back
and haunt me for that, or...

01:26:39.849 --> 01:26:40.873
I... I don't know.

01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:42.815
I kind of missed
the orientation speech.

01:26:48.191 --> 01:26:49.590
Don't worry.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.555
Kate, I will make him happy.

01:26:57.467 --> 01:26:58.900
I love Gardenias.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.504
Sorry.

01:27:34.804 --> 01:27:37.102
We are gathered here
in the presence of God...

01:27:37.173 --> 01:27:39.573
to witness the exchanging
of vows that will bind...

01:27:39.642 --> 01:27:41.610
- # I can see clearly now #
- this couple together...

01:27:41.678 --> 01:27:42.487
# The rain is gone #

01:27:42.488 --> 01:27:44.306
in the covenant and
relationship of marriage.

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.076
When the ceremony has ended,
they will leave this place...

01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:49.618
- # I can see all obstacles #
- as husband and wife...

01:27:49.686 --> 01:27:51.711
- # In my way #
- for the very first time.

01:27:54.591 --> 01:28:00.029
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

01:28:00.096 --> 01:28:02.087
# It's gonna be a bright #

01:28:03.099 --> 01:28:05.932
# Bright, sunshiny day #

01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:09.403
# Yeah #

01:28:09.472 --> 01:28:11.201
# Look all around #

01:28:11.274 --> 01:28:15.370
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

01:28:16.813 --> 01:28:18.337
# Look straight ahead #

01:28:18.414 --> 01:28:23.909
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

01:28:23.987 --> 01:28:26.182
# I can see clearly now #

01:28:26.255 --> 01:28:28.553
# The rain is gone #

01:28:31.494 --> 01:28:35.863
# I can see all obstacles
in my way #

01:28:38.935 --> 01:28:44.168
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.265
- # It's gonna be a bright #
- Hello, Kate.

01:28:46.342 --> 01:28:47.673
- # Bright #
- # Bright #

01:28:47.744 --> 01:28:49.473
Not you again! Come on!

01:28:49.545 --> 01:28:51.604
Relax! I'm just here
to congratulate you.

01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:52.807
Really?

01:28:52.882 --> 01:28:54.213
I did the right thing?

01:28:54.283 --> 01:28:55.875
You certainly did.

01:28:55.952 --> 01:28:57.613
Now just give me back
the orb of true light...

01:28:57.687 --> 01:28:59.120
that you collected
from your loved ones...

01:28:59.188 --> 01:29:00.712
and you can move on.

01:29:01.357 --> 01:29:02.324
I'm sorry,
the orb of which what?

01:29:02.392 --> 01:29:03.552
Oh, dear.

01:29:03.626 --> 01:29:04.684
Are you screwing with me?

01:29:04.761 --> 01:29:06.490
Are you allowed
to screw with me?

01:29:06.562 --> 01:29:07.529
Hey, hey, no!

01:29:07.597 --> 01:29:09.360
You are not disappearing
on another conversation!

01:29:09.432 --> 01:29:11.332
You better hope I don't end up
in this room again!

01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:12.925
I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:29:13.002 --> 01:29:14.230
Get back here!

01:29:15.371 --> 01:29:16.895
# Hey now now #

01:29:16.973 --> 01:29:20.136
# They'll find you
when you're sleepin', now now #

01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:23.474
# They'll reach in and grab
what you're dreamin', now now #

01:29:23.546 --> 01:29:25.343
# Cut it up
and slip it back in #

01:29:25.415 --> 01:29:28.350
# And I know, and I know,
and I know it #

01:29:28.418 --> 01:29:29.783
# Hey now now #

01:29:29.852 --> 01:29:33.049
# The smallest things
are crushin' me now #

01:29:33.122 --> 01:29:36.285
# The crush, crush, crush
is so comforting now #

01:29:36.359 --> 01:29:38.418
# Did the Earth just slam
in the sun? #

01:29:38.494 --> 01:29:41.554
# And I know, and I know,
and I know it #

01:29:41.631 --> 01:29:48.059
# Won't undo my past by walkin'
and talkin' backwards #

01:29:48.137 --> 01:29:50.867
# Hey now now,
we're goin' down down #

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.601
# And we ride the bus there #

01:29:52.675 --> 01:29:54.165
# Pay the bus fare #

01:29:54.243 --> 01:29:55.938
# Or we find a new reason #

01:29:56.012 --> 01:29:57.445
# A new way of livin' #

01:29:57.513 --> 01:29:58.844
# And we shout it out #

01:29:58.915 --> 01:30:01.076
# And try to dream again #

01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:03.846
# Hey now now,
we're goin' down down #

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.751
# And we ride the bus there #

01:30:05.822 --> 01:30:07.312

# A new way of livin' #

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:11.950
# And we shout it out #

01:30:12.028 --> 01:30:14.087
# And we try to dream again #

01:30:14.163 --> 01:30:16.654
# Down, down, down #

01:30:27.443 --> 01:30:28.876
# Hey now now #

01:30:28.945 --> 01:30:30.435
# We're goin' down down #

01:30:30.513 --> 01:30:32.174

# A new way of livin' #

01:30:36.886 --> 01:30:38.285
# And we breathe it in #

01:30:38.354 --> 01:30:40.447
# And try to dream again #

01:30:40.523 --> 01:30:43.424

# And try to dream again #

01:31:36.646 --> 01:31:37.943
# He said, "I'll protect you #

01:31:38.014 --> 01:31:41.108
# "like you are
the crown jewels," yet #

01:31:42.785 --> 01:31:44.685
# Said he's feelin'
sorrier for me #

01:31:44.754 --> 01:31:48.019
# The more I behave badly,
I can bet #

01:31:50.159 --> 01:31:56.189
# Hey, Lloyd,
I'm ready to be heartbroken #

01:31:56.265 --> 01:31:58.859
# 'Cause I can't see further #

01:31:58.935 --> 01:32:02.598
# Than my own nose
at this moment #

01:32:10.379 --> 01:32:12.176
# Jealousy is more than a word #

01:32:12.248 --> 01:32:14.682
# Now I understand #

01:32:16.953 --> 01:32:18.818
# You can't stand a girl #

01:32:18.888 --> 01:32:23.723
# While holdin' a boy's hand #

01:32:23.793 --> 01:32:29.663
# Hey, Lloyd,
I'm ready to be heartbroken #

01:32:29.732 --> 01:32:32.394
# 'Cause I can't see further #

01:32:32.468 --> 01:32:36.199

at this moment #

01:32:50.119 --> 01:32:52.019
# At this moment #

01:33:51.781 --> 01:33:56.047
# I got my life,
a compilation here to sort out #

01:33:57.954 --> 01:34:01.048
# Take myself
to an East Coast city #

01:34:01.123 --> 01:34:03.421
# And walk about #

01:34:05.161 --> 01:34:11.031
# Hey, Lloyd,
I'm ready to be heartbroken #

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.591
