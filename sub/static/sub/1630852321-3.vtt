02:59.440 --> 03:00.876
I just don't like
the physical stuff.

- I'm gonna say, you know what?
I pick Cynthia because--

03:08.188 --> 03:09.493
- I could never say that,
though.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.234
- Not only is she beautiful
on the outside,

03:11.278 --> 03:12.366
she's beautiful
on the inside.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.498
- I don't know.
I couldn't do that.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.152
- But you kept asking her
if she was mad at you.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.371
What did she say?

03:17.414 --> 03:19.721
- Like, she was annoyed
by that, 100%.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.637
- I was like, I don't know if
this girl's gonna flip a table

03:22.680 --> 03:24.943
because that's
what I'm used to.

03:24.987 --> 03:27.511

03:27.555 --> 03:29.818

03:29.861 --> 03:31.123

03:31.167 --> 03:33.213

- Oh, Luann, come in.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.476
- Um, in my feelings
a little bit.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.695
- Hi. Who's there?

03:37.739 --> 03:39.654
- It's the countess. It's
day three of my video diaries.

03:39.697 --> 03:40.829
- Oh, hey.
Good morning.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.700
Oh, my God.
I love this yellow on you.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.660
- Thank you. Thank you.
How are you, honey?

03:45.703 --> 03:47.444
- I'm good.
How are you doing?

03:47.488 --> 03:49.272
- Well, you know,
I'm not doing that great today.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.708
- What's going on?
I'm gonna--can I--

03:50.752 --> 03:52.623
I'm gonna jump into bed.
- Yeah, just jump into bed.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.538
Just jump into bed.
- I'm gonna jump in your bed.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.366
- Okay.
I'm gonna walk around a few.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.585
<i>I've known Luann for years.</i>

03:57.628 --> 04:00.588
She is just unapologetically
who she is.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.720
<i>She's a free spirit.
She's European.</i>

04:02.764 --> 04:04.548
Like, they just
walk around naked,

04:04.592 --> 04:05.897
smoking cigarettes and stuff.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.639
<i>Just a easy girl
to kind of hang out with.</i>

04:08.683 --> 04:10.902
So I feel like I can
talk to her for real, for real.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.818
Last night,
I was a little disappointed.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.734
I gave Kyle somewhat of a pass
because I don't know Kyle.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.997
And I always am going
to respect

04:19.041 --> 04:21.913
any of you guys' point of view.
I'm a team player.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.567
I'm here to do whatever
you guys want me to do.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.395
- Of course.
- But here's the thing.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.919
I came on the trip
to become friends with Kyle.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.399
I am friends with Kenya.

04:29.443 --> 04:30.835
I hold them
to two different standards.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.576
- Right.
- I didn't want to pick either.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.099
But I have to be honest
with you.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.188
I think something pissed
her off in the beginning.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.712
She was mad at the table.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.583
- I think she was annoyed
with Kenya, I was picking up.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.019
- But why?
Why was she annoyed with Kenya?

04:41.063 --> 04:42.760
- Maybe because she was late.
I don't know.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.459
- She--she looked
pissed off to me.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.677
<i>- "Who is the prettiest"?</i>

04:46.721 --> 04:48.113
Like, everyone here
is gorgeous.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.985
- It's like...

04:50.028 --> 04:51.595
- Okay, well,
they're putting out the food

04:51.639 --> 04:53.293
and Kenya has already
started eating.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.599
- I have low blood sugar.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.340
- I started this trip, Luann.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.081
It was very important to me

04:59.124 --> 05:00.952
to make sure
that Kenya was comfortable.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.258
- Right, right.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.955
- I did my whole thing
on the plane for her.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.479
<i>This is Brooklyn.</i>

05:05.522 --> 05:07.524
This is the first time Kenya
has left this little girl.

05:07.568 --> 05:08.960
So Kenya Moore.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.267
Don't you see?
Same, but we can't be late.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.051
Cut the cord!

05:13.095 --> 05:15.967
I was a little...hurt

05:16.011 --> 05:21.451
that Kenya twirled
into the dinner

05:21.495 --> 05:22.800
45, maybe an hour--

05:22.844 --> 05:24.367
I stop counting
after a while--late.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.803
- Mm-hmm.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.328
- Strolls her ass right in.
Takes her time.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.242
Goes fix herself a plate.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.636
A macaroni and cheese.
- I couldn't believe that.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.336
- Macaroni
and god damn cheese, okay?

05:36.379 --> 05:37.772
Now we've been
waiting graciously.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.077
- I know.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.557
- You know who wants
some macaroni and cheese?

05:40.601 --> 05:41.732
I did.
- I know.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.647
- But I wanted to wait
for my "friend."

05:43.691 --> 05:45.997
- Well, and that's also
the gracious

05:46.041 --> 05:48.565
and elegant thing to do,
is you don't start eating

05:48.609 --> 05:50.306
before everybody's
sitting down with food.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.786
- Uh, class.
- You know that.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.310
- Money came with class.
- That's right.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.226
I would say that Cynthia is
a very supportive girlfriend,

05:57.269 --> 05:59.315
<i>but Cynthia has expectations</i>

05:59.359 --> 06:01.143
that Kenya
maybe can't deliver on.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.536
- And it's a respect thing.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.669
- Yeah, but you and Kenya
are, you know, besties,

06:05.713 --> 06:06.801
you're old friends.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.455
I feel like you can
pull her aside

06:08.498 --> 06:09.717
and you can tell her.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.632
- Oh, I'm definitely
pulling Kenya aside.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.285
We're definitely
having a conversation

06:13.329 --> 06:14.852
because that's my friend.
- Right.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.680
- So act like a goddamn friend.
- And you are gracious.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.732
- Hi.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.734
Oh, you and these outfits,

06:26.777 --> 06:29.432
you always come
so island-ready and beautiful.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.955
- Thank you.
- Love that.

06:32.696 --> 06:35.525
- Is that your potato salad?
- It is.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.701
Now, I'm going to enjoy it.
- Yeah.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.051
- Take my time and enjoy it.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.053
- Michael, can I have
some potato salad?

06:42.097 --> 06:43.620
- I'll bring it out.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.448
- Oh, potato salad
for breakfast?

06:45.492 --> 06:46.884
- Yeah.
- I love the sound of that.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.538
- Thank you.
- That was good, right?

06:48.582 --> 06:49.583
I know.
- Thank you so much.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.585
- I'm not kidding.
It is so good.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.196
- Morning. How are you?
- Good. How are you?

06:54.239 --> 06:55.415
- I'm good.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.381
I was actually looking--

07:05.425 --> 07:06.730
I wanted to come
to your room earlier,

07:06.774 --> 07:09.080
but I didn't want to,
like, invade your space.

07:09.124 --> 07:12.257
But I really hope I did not
make you feel bad last night.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.608
I'm so sorry if I did.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.523
- You've apologized a few times

07:16.566 --> 07:19.743
and I completely respect
your point of view.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.833
I said several times,
this does not have to be mean.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.226
I'm not a mean girl.
- Oh, I know.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.707
- I don't wanna have--
make anyone uncomfortable.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.449
I changed the game several
times throughout the night

07:29.492 --> 07:30.885
to make sure
everybody was comfortable

07:30.928 --> 07:32.669
and basically
reinvented the game

07:32.713 --> 07:34.105
just so we could just get to...

07:34.149 --> 07:36.107
- And you did a great job
with that.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.892
- That ended up happening
in the end.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.894
I know things about you guys.
- It turned out to be great.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.373
Yeah.
- Yeah, and it went well.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.940
It was great.
- No.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.507
Like, for me, it was just,
like, the respect

07:44.551 --> 07:45.639
that it was my night.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.728
- I guess
we're still not over this.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.860
- I don't know if I accept
Kyle's apology or not.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.036
All I know is,
I can appreciate

07:52.080 --> 07:54.735
that she's making an effort
to apologize,

07:54.778 --> 07:57.999
but emotionally,
I just can't move on right now.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.957
- I mean, I thought my friends
in Beverly Hills were dramatic.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.482
This is taking it
to another level.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.222
Were you upset with Kenya
last night?

08:04.266 --> 08:05.920
- That's a Kenya and Cynthia
conversation.

08:05.963 --> 08:10.402
We're--we're good.
I'll talk to Kenya myself.

08:10.446 --> 08:11.926
For me,
it's just the support.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.145
It's a barbeque.
Let's have fun.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.582
<i>- Cynthia said
this is a girl's trip</i>

08:15.625 --> 08:16.931
and we're supposed to have fun.

08:16.974 --> 08:20.195
Well, I am having zero fun
right now.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.153
- Oh, my God.
When is her court date?

08:22.197 --> 08:24.199
- She said right now.
- Right now.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.331
<i>- I just saw her walking up
the stairs pretty quickly</i>

08:26.375 --> 08:27.985
<i>and she said she was--had--</i>

08:28.029 --> 08:29.247
she was on with some court
or something.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.814
- Sending good energy and vibe,
girls.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.555
Let's send it all.
- I don't know what it's about.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.818
I just heard her say that.
- Well, it's about her divorce.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.733
- Well, she told me originally
it was about her divorce.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.518
- About her divorce.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.780
- You okay?

08:39.823 --> 08:41.259
- Kenya, are you okay?

08:41.303 --> 08:45.046
- All that stuff is just
really--it's just hard.

08:47.222 --> 08:51.182
And then we have to do court
and it's on YouTube

08:51.226 --> 08:52.749
so everyone can see.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.229
- Oh, really?

08:54.272 --> 08:56.144
- I want to start
with the big question.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.363
Where do things stand
with you two now?

08:58.407 --> 08:59.800
- I filed for divorce.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.324
We're still in court,
but I--I want sole custody.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.805
It's like if you were
in a courtroom, it's public.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.807
Anyone can log in to watch.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.766
And the things that are
being said and stuff,

09:09.810 --> 09:11.028
it's just so private.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.727
You can hear people
talking about money

09:13.770 --> 09:15.206
and how much they make
and I had to...

09:15.250 --> 09:16.817
- No, that's weird.
That is very strange.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.254
- File paperwork
to show how much I make.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.690
It's, like, crazy.
- That's terrible.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.213
It's such an invasion.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.915
<i>- I love Kenya, but
I'm upset with her right now.</i>

09:27.958 --> 09:33.007
So the fact that she has
come downstairs and is upset,

09:33.050 --> 09:35.313
<i>it's kinda like, well,
now we're just both upset.</i>

09:35.357 --> 09:37.968
You didn't concern yourself
about my feelings,

09:38.012 --> 09:41.319
so it's kinda hard for me
to concern myself about yours.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.104
- It's a public forum.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.064
- To sit there in court

09:47.108 --> 09:51.721
and have these strangers
talking about your child...

09:51.765 --> 09:54.332
- Personal thing.
- Your, um...

09:54.376 --> 09:55.638
- It's a lot.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.944
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
- Yeah.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.950
-
That is an invasion of privacy.

10:18.052 --> 10:21.621
- To sit there in court
and have these strangers

10:21.664 --> 10:24.928
talking about your child,

10:24.972 --> 10:26.713
your, um...

10:26.756 --> 10:27.975

10:28.018 --> 10:29.367
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
- Yeah.

10:32.414 --> 10:35.199
-
That is an invasion of privacy.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.288
Like, such an invasion.
- Yeah, I just got the chills.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.595
<i>- I mean, it's upsetting
because this is something</i>

10:39.639 --> 10:41.728
that has meant
the most to me in my life,

10:41.771 --> 10:43.425
and I'm losing it
in front of everyone

10:43.468 --> 10:45.383
and then I have
to talk about it.

10:45.427 --> 10:48.735
<i>I'm in a public forum
with any Tom, Dick, and Harry.</i>

10:48.778 --> 10:51.651
<i>They can listen to
my daughter, intimate details,</i>

10:51.694 --> 10:53.522
<i>finances.</i>

10:53.565 --> 10:57.439
It's very difficult to share
those details with strangers.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.964
- How long were you married?

11:01.008 --> 11:02.574
- Well...

11:02.618 --> 11:04.881
I'm still married.

11:04.925 --> 11:08.798
It will be actually four years
in--in June.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.887
- Oh, I didn't even think
it was that long.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.324
- Yeah, we've been separated
for over a year.

11:13.368 --> 11:16.937
- Some potato salad?
- For breakfast, no.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.680
- I didn't know you were
married for four years.

11:20.723 --> 11:21.898
- I have not dated.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.770
I have not had sex
in over a year, but...

11:23.813 --> 11:25.336
- Like, do you think
he's dating?

11:27.382 --> 11:29.471
- I'm pretty sure.
Yeah.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.734
- People send my husband
naked pictures.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.083
- I know, right?
- What?

11:33.127 --> 11:34.694
- Do you guys get dick pics?

11:34.737 --> 11:36.434
- Never.
- I actually got one.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.350
- On WhatsApp,
I get, like, porn videos.

11:39.394 --> 11:42.223
- Wait, wait, wait,
I forgot to ask you about this.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.617
We had this party where
you had the stripper guy.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.141
- Oh, that was
my bachelorette party.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.708
- What was his name again?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.666
Bolum.
- Bolum.

11:52.799 --> 11:56.541
Bolum.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.590
- Damn, girl.
- That's real?

12:01.633 --> 12:03.374
- It, like,
goes down to, like...

12:03.418 --> 12:05.768
- Maybe like that.
- Almost to his knees.

12:05.812 --> 12:10.599
The video someone sent me,
he was on a cantaloupe.

12:10.642 --> 12:14.081
And he puts a hole in the melon
and then the melon.

12:15.822 --> 12:16.823
- Stop.
- That's nasty.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.607
- And the melon explodes.
- Stop.

12:18.650 --> 12:19.869
Stop. No.
Oh, my God.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.218
- Wait.
- It's insane.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.567
I have to show it to you.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.395
- I'm not a prude,
but I don't really like

12:24.439 --> 12:26.789
to talk about sex
and body parts.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.966
<i>It's called having class,
decorum, and elegance.</i>

- Okay.

13:14.619 --> 13:15.969

13:17.492 --> 13:19.450
a couple treatments
in particular for the ladies.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.931

wrap, so is that happening?

want to have is a pedicure.

they have perfect pedicures.

Mine does not.

tucking my toes in?

13:30.461 --> 13:31.941
- Yeah, I'm not looking
at your toes.

"Michael is so elegant

Where's the volleyball?

14:20.120 --> 14:22.905
- All right, tighten it,
like, at the tree.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.515
- Water.
Bottle of water.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.082
- I thought we were
playing volleyball.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.432
- I don't know anyone who plays
volleyball like you girls.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.434
- This is my volleyball outfit.
- I'm in athletic.

14:33.829 --> 14:36.005

<i>- Girl, where are you going?</i>

14:37.311 --> 14:39.922

So listen.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.715
I think Cynthia is mad at me.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.152
- I think she's mad
at both of us.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.197
- Did she say--say hi to you?
Like--

14:54.241 --> 14:56.156
- She was very frosty.

14:56.199 --> 14:59.115
- Yeah. She's frosty
toward me today too.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.291
- Can I be honest? I think
she might be a little annoyed

15:01.335 --> 15:02.684
that you came down so late.

15:02.727 --> 15:05.078
- The glam girl
was 30 minutes late,

15:05.121 --> 15:06.644
so that threw me off, so...

15:06.688 --> 15:08.081
- I'll have Cynthia
call the glam girl

15:08.124 --> 15:09.212
and have a talk with her
instead.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.171
- Right. I think so.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.781
But I don't--I think
it's more than that.

15:12.824 --> 15:16.785
I just think that she also
feels like you and I are, like,

15:16.828 --> 15:18.656
you know, super clique-y.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.745
- Really?
Would that bother her?

15:20.789 --> 15:23.966
- She said it to me yesterday
when--when we were on the boat.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.750
- No, she did not.
-

15:25.794 --> 15:28.405
Yes, she did.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.799
- Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

15:30.842 --> 15:32.583
I would never think

15:32.627 --> 15:34.281
she would even think that way
in a million years.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.804
- Yeah. She did.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.066
- What?
Are we in high school here?

15:37.110 --> 15:38.981
Like, I feel like
Teresa and Cynthia

15:39.025 --> 15:41.941
are getting along amazing,
and like,

15:41.984 --> 15:43.290
<i>I'm good with that.</i>

15:43.333 --> 15:44.856
<i>I don't--I don't--

<i>And it looks like Kenya
doesn't give a either,</i>

15:46.902 --> 15:50.645

she's so sensitive about it.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.300
Maybe she's feeling like
you're hers.

15:53.343 --> 15:56.738

have fought over me.

15:56.781 --> 16:00.437

It's all in the booty.

a couple of things

was my night,

21:24.718 --> 21:29.200

21:29.244 --> 21:30.680
no sense of urgency,

made yourself a plate

the first thing.

that point, there were moments

where you just could have been
a little more supportive.

you have explained or--

21:54.574 --> 21:57.490
- And modified the game
to make everyone comfortable,

21:57.533 --> 22:00.884

times, gave the disclaimer--

when you were talking.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.974

- Okay.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.672
- So if you can--
- I'll go back to it, go ahead.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.848
- So what I was saying is

22:07.891 --> 22:10.677
I think that you have
to, you know, adapt.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.293

I'm explaining to you that
those girls were uncomfortable.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.362
They don't have to feel
the same way as you.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.756
They didn't want to do it.

Kyle and I were having a Kiki.
It wasn't about you.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.941
- Kenya,
I was talking at one point,

this together for you guys.

23:45.293 --> 23:48.035
Like, I just would like
that same respect.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.124
I felt like in that moment,

23:50.167 --> 23:51.691
you could have been
a little bit more supportive,

23:51.734 --> 23:54.433
and you can't tell me
how to feel, and that's it.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.263
- You know it's interesting
because on my show,

23:59.307 --> 24:02.310
I'm usually the one
that's being pushed out...

24:02.353 --> 24:04.573
From the friend circle,

24:04.617 --> 24:07.924
<i>but here,
I'm vibing with everyone,</i>

24:07.968 --> 24:10.797

24:10.840 --> 24:13.930
<i>who I really am
and they like me.</i>

24:13.974 --> 24:16.237
And I think that
Cynthia is just jealous

24:16.280 --> 24:18.935
because she's not really
vibing with these women.

24:18.979 --> 24:21.503
Well, I am definitely going to

24:21.547 --> 24:24.550
continue being supportive,
but I'm not going to go

24:24.593 --> 24:26.813
against how I feel
because my feelings are--

24:26.856 --> 24:28.249
- And I would never ask you to.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.512
You never do, and I don't
expect you to start now.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.427
- Okay, all right, cool.

24:32.471 --> 24:36.387
- My goal was to let my friend
know that my feelings were hurt

24:36.431 --> 24:39.042
and to get back
on the same page.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.653
<i>I'm not really sure
what Kenya's goal was,</i>

24:40.696 --> 24:43.569

she didn't get it.

Oh, my God.
You got the best boo-tay.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.380
- Can I get some water, please?
- Thank you.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.947
- I thought you said you were
going to go in the water.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.167
- I want to go in the water,
and I want to get some water.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.951
- Oh, okay.
- Like some woh-ter.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.039
- Got it.
- How do you guys say water?

26:03.083 --> 26:04.606
- It's water.
- Water.

26:04.650 --> 26:05.868
- I would like to--
- You guys say woh-ter.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.000
- Would you like
a glass of water?

26:09.002 --> 26:10.960
Ramona has an accent, too.
- Does she?

26:11.004 --> 26:12.309
- But it's like,
you know, more like,

26:12.353 --> 26:13.876
you know, it's like clips.
It's like, you know.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.574
- Yeah, she just talks fast.
- Yeah, she talks fast,

26:15.617 --> 26:17.358
and she's like, "I am who I am.
That's what it is.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.881
I apologize.
What are you gonna do?"

26:21.884 --> 26:25.061
- I'm so hungry.
This looks amazing.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.020
- Is that like
a tuna tartar in a glass?

26:27.063 --> 26:28.674
- Yeah.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.632
- So, Ramona,
what's going on with John?

26:30.676 --> 26:33.026
I mean, I'm like,
when is he gonna make a move?

26:33.069 --> 26:35.115
- You know,
everything in slow time.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.073
I'm not in a rush
for anything anymore.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.685
- What?
- Everything in time.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.078
- You guys ever have, like,
conversations about,

26:42.122 --> 26:43.297
like, personal things?

26:43.340 --> 26:44.515
- We're just friends.
And you know what?

26:44.559 --> 26:46.082
I'm starting
with our friendship.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.431
If it goes somewhere, it does.
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.085
So I'll always have him
as a friend.

26:49.129 --> 26:50.652
<i>- From what I've seen,</i>

26:50.696 --> 26:53.350
Ramona is a very
aggressive person, obviously,

26:53.394 --> 26:56.310
<i>and now she's playing
all coy and shy.</i>

26:56.353 --> 26:57.920
She doesn't want to talk
about her love life.

26:57.964 --> 27:01.184
Girl, that is an act, okay?

27:01.228 --> 27:03.622
Acting class is down the hall.
It's not here.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.711
- We're just friends
at this point.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.017
You know, maybe he's into
the 20-somethings.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.323
- Oh, man.

27:09.366 --> 27:10.585
- Or maybe he likes
a little chocolate.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.021
- Ah!

27:12.065 --> 27:13.501
There you go.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.677
<i>- Listen, Kenya can't even
keep her husband.</i>

27:15.721 --> 27:17.287
<i>I was married
for over 20 years.</i>

27:17.331 --> 27:19.376
What was she married for?
Like, a hop--

27:19.420 --> 27:21.378
What do you call it?

27:21.422 --> 27:23.467
Flippity flop?
What do you call it?

27:23.511 --> 27:25.992
Not even for a hot second,
for goodness sakes!

27:26.035 --> 27:27.428
- Hey, Kyle, I have a question.
- Yes?

27:27.471 --> 27:28.472
Can you tell me
a little bit more

27:28.516 --> 27:29.952
about the astrologer tonight?

27:29.996 --> 27:31.606
Does she read cards?

27:31.650 --> 27:34.087
Does she read hands?
Like, how does it work?

27:34.130 --> 27:35.392
- So it's basically just seeing

27:35.436 --> 27:36.742
from your birthday and stuff,
I guess.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.352
- Okay.

27:38.395 --> 27:41.485
<i>- I definitely believe
in this one million percent.</i>

27:41.529 --> 27:44.619
I had a psychic tell me
that I was going to be

27:44.663 --> 27:48.405
on a reality show,
most likely with my sister Kim.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.146
And then she said
there's gonna be lights

27:50.190 --> 27:52.061
shining on you like this
in October,

27:52.105 --> 27:53.497
<i>and that's when it premiered.</i>

27:53.541 --> 27:55.456
<i>We had a premiere,
so I have high hopes.</i>

27:55.499 --> 27:58.677
And I think it always makes for
an interesting dinner party.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.288
If my husband ever leaves me,
I'm going with him.

28:01.331 --> 28:03.899
- He will never emotionally
fulfill you, ever.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.901
Know that.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.556
As soon as the kids are bigger,
you'll have nothing in common.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.778
- Oh, that'd be fun.
- And when's your birthday?

28:12.821 --> 28:14.910
- I'm a Scorpio.

28:14.954 --> 28:16.999
- Taurus, Taurus,
Scorpio, Aries.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.566
- Oh, I get along so well
with Tauruses.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.002
Taurus, the bull,
you can be stubborn.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.613
- I'm very stubborn, yes.
-

28:22.657 --> 28:24.659
- I mean,
I've gotten softer now

28:24.703 --> 28:27.270
as I've gotten older,
right, Melissa?

28:27.314 --> 28:29.229
- No.
-

28:29.272 --> 28:31.231
- No, she said.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.667
- No, Teresa.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.277
We can't lie to people.
We have to be honest.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.192
- Like, how does it work?
Like, you guys are family.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.803
You work on a show together.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.805
Like, does that make you guys
automatically besties?

28:39.848 --> 28:41.763
- It doesn't make us
automatic besties.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.460
It makes us--
we love each other.

28:43.504 --> 28:44.723
- Mm-hmm.

28:44.766 --> 28:45.811
- We have a lot of respect
for each other.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.116
- But families fight.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.596
- We actually do have
a lot of fun together.

28:48.639 --> 28:51.077
But a lot of times other people
get involved with us

28:51.120 --> 28:52.861
and it us up
a little bit.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.384
- True or not true,

28:54.428 --> 28:55.603
Teresa had no idea
you were coming on the show.

28:55.646 --> 28:56.691
- Untrue.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.520
- Okay.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.000
- But her and I--
- I didn't know.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.436
- You didn't know.
You didn't know.

29:02.479 --> 29:03.393
- She knew.
- Oh, wow.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.743
- She knew.
- I didn't know

29:04.786 --> 29:06.266
until I got the phone call
from Andy.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.050
- Right, so Andy called her
and said--

29:08.094 --> 29:09.312
- No, I only--

29:09.356 --> 29:10.966
- We're interviewing
your sister-in-law.

29:11.010 --> 29:11.924
- No, he didn't--Andy called me
and said your sister-in-law

29:11.967 --> 29:13.055
won't stop DMing me.

29:13.099 --> 29:14.535
She wants to get on the show.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.537
- No, I never DM'd him.
That's what I'm telling you.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.365
- 'Cause that's what he said
to me so take it up with him.

29:18.408 --> 29:19.758
He's out there.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.238
- They inboxed me
to interview her and I--

29:22.282 --> 29:23.849
which by the way,
they still--

29:23.892 --> 29:26.416
they inbox all of my friends
still right now looking for--

29:26.460 --> 29:28.244
- Yeah, but all my friends,

29:28.288 --> 29:29.680
as soon as they get inboxed,
they say--

29:29.724 --> 29:32.031

- No, we weren't Teresa.

29:39.952 --> 29:40.909
Don't lie

29:54.967 --> 29:56.185
what we weren't talking--
unless they were just mad

29:56.229 --> 29:58.187

I didn't know
if we were gonna do it or not.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.572
Of course,
we interviewed for the show,

30:35.616 --> 30:37.313
and of course they wanted us.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.228
It's a family show.
Caroline was on the show.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.229
Dina was--
they want sister-in-laws.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.709
Like, that's what they want.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.580
<i>- When they first asked me
to join the show,</i>

30:43.624 --> 30:44.973
I was trying to get a feeling

30:45.017 --> 30:47.106
of what exactly goes on
with these shows.

30:47.149 --> 30:50.587
<i>I was watching wigs
being pulled on "Atlanta."</i>

30:50.631 --> 30:51.893
So I was like, "Oh, wait.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.417
There's family members
on 'New Jersey.'"

30:54.461 --> 30:56.245
<i>I mean, how hard could it be?</i>

30:58.552 --> 31:00.249
That's funny
that I even thought that.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.208
- We went to film
at the christening.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.036
They said, she wouldn't sign.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.994
She was like,
"I'm not signing this paper.

31:06.038 --> 31:09.302
If you cast my brother and
my sister, I will not sign."

31:09.345 --> 31:10.607
Finally she gave in...
- No, no, no, no!

31:10.651 --> 31:12.479
- And filmed with us.
- No, I was like, this--

31:12.522 --> 31:13.959
I don't wanna fight
with my family.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.178
To me, family's everything.
- We didn't have to fight.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.832
- I--look what happened!

31:18.180 --> 31:20.530
- Just walk away, go.
Just walk the away.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.663
- Don't.
- So why'd you invite me then?

31:22.706 --> 31:24.012
- Take a walk, you garbage...
- All right, fine.

31:24.056 --> 31:25.361
- Mother
- Stop.

31:25.405 --> 31:26.710
- You two trying to play
both sides of the family.

31:26.754 --> 31:27.929
-
- Stop.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.800
- Get the out of here.
- Whatever!

31:29.844 --> 31:31.280
- Son of a bitch!

31:31.324 --> 31:33.021
- This is a christening!
No!

31:33.065 --> 31:35.328
- Did you guys ever watch
"The Godfather" movie?

31:35.371 --> 31:37.504
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.201
- I am all about
"The Godfather" movie.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.420
- Don't kill us!

31:40.463 --> 31:42.726
- You never go
against the family!

31:42.770 --> 31:44.815
- Hold on to this table.
- No, I swear to God.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.470
No, I'm serious!

31:47.514 --> 31:51.039
I wanted to show America
what family's truly about,

31:51.083 --> 31:52.475
like sticking together,

31:52.519 --> 31:55.261
and you don't go
against the family.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.828
- Well, wait, wait, why didn't
you text her and tell her?

31:57.872 --> 32:00.048
- I--you're not listening!
- Sorry.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.441
<i>I'm just asking
a very innocent question.</i>

32:01.484 --> 32:02.964
I bonded with them,

32:03.008 --> 32:05.706
and I didn't know it'd start
"third world two."

32:05.749 --> 32:07.447
- It looks to me like
Melissa and Teresa

32:07.490 --> 32:09.405
have buried the hatchet,
but you know,

32:09.449 --> 32:11.320
I don't know how deep
the hatchet is.

32:11.364 --> 32:13.453
-
- What?

32:13.496 --> 32:15.063
- What the
is "third world two"?

32:15.107 --> 32:17.413
- I made a mistake.
It's third world three.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.024
Third--a third world.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.721
- World War?
- Yeah.

32:20.764 --> 32:24.507
<i>- I don't see any real
chemistry or compatibility</i>

32:24.551 --> 32:26.161
between Melissa and Teresa.

32:26.205 --> 32:29.121
<i>These women are connected
by family and that is it.</i>

32:29.164 --> 32:32.515
It just doesn't seem like
they like each other that much.

32:32.559 --> 32:33.864
- All right,
let's change the subject.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.475
- Let's go relax.

32:35.518 --> 32:37.738
- This is the perfect time
for a massage.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.827
- Girls, you ready
to change the energy?

32:39.870 --> 32:41.089
- We've only been talking
about the fact

32:41.133 --> 32:42.221
that I'm on the show
for the last 11 years.

32:42.264 --> 32:43.570
- I know, right?

32:43.613 --> 32:44.527
- It's like
killing a dead horse.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.007
Like, get over it.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.140
- I mean, like, we're never
gonna agree that the...

32:48.183 --> 32:49.315
- Yeah.
- You know?

32:49.358 --> 32:50.359
So it's like,
nobody knows the truth.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.534
- How long have you been
on the show?

32:51.578 --> 32:52.666
- I've been on this show
since season one.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.928
- Wow.
- And they came on season three.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.974
- Yeah.
- These are the underwear?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.279
- Yeah.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.672
Would you like to go put it on?
- No, ma'am.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.543
- I'm gonna go put it on
and come back.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.545
- This looks like a mask.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.286

42:16.272 --> 42:18.536
You're also a visionary.
- I've heard that before.

42:18.579 --> 42:20.059
- Where's all my plumbers at?

42:20.102 --> 42:21.582
- Melissa.
- Yes.

42:21.626 --> 42:23.758
- In your past life,
you were a beautiful princess

42:23.802 --> 42:25.325
of a small country.

42:25.368 --> 42:27.240
<i>- We're all royalty.</i>

42:27.283 --> 42:29.764
- I don't know.
I like the princess part.

42:29.808 --> 42:34.421
- Teresa, you used to be
a very seductive dancer.

42:34.464 --> 42:36.945
<i>- Oh, isn't it ironic?</i>

42:36.989 --> 42:39.774
I was always accused
of being the exotic dancer.

42:39.818 --> 42:41.036
It looks like it was Teresa.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.604
- The next is Ramona.
- In her past life,

42:43.648 --> 42:45.084
did she always have to have
the best bedroom?

42:45.127 --> 42:46.476
I just--
- Ah!

42:46.520 --> 42:48.261
- Yeah, you were a queen.

42:48.304 --> 42:49.436
- I had the best room.
- No wonder!

42:49.479 --> 42:51.307
- There you go.
Now we know.

42:51.351 --> 42:53.048
- Oh, my God.
Now it makes sense.

42:53.092 --> 42:54.572
<i>♪</i>

42:54.615 --> 42:57.575
- The only real royalty
in this room tonight, darling,

42:57.618 --> 43:01.666
is a countess
and a former Miss USA.

43:03.319 --> 43:04.625
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

43:04.669 --> 43:06.540
- It was really beautiful.
So insightful.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.455
- Good luck to you all.
- Thank you.

43:08.498 --> 43:09.978
- Thank you, Linda.
- I need to give you a hug.

43:10.022 --> 43:11.327
- So everyone gets a crown?

<i>♪</i>

43:15.680 --> 43:18.030
- I love the way you did that.

43:19.509 --> 43:21.511
So what year did you
win the pageant?

43:21.555 --> 43:23.122
- Many years ago.
- Okay.

43:23.165 --> 43:24.123
- In the '90s.
- In the '90s.

43:24.166 --> 43:25.428
- Yeah.
- Cool.

43:25.472 --> 43:27.692
I won a pageant in Europe too.
Lady Universe.

43:27.735 --> 43:29.694
<i>They gave me a car
and a watch, yeah.</i>

43:29.737 --> 43:31.478
- Yeah, they gave me a car,
a boat.

43:31.521 --> 43:34.437
- It opened up so many
opportunities for me in Italy.

43:34.481 --> 43:36.483
Not in America, you know.
This was in Europe.

43:36.526 --> 43:39.051
- I was a judge
for Miss Universe

43:39.094 --> 43:40.879
in the Philippines and I--

43:40.922 --> 43:43.795
- I don't think
I was the best looking there.

43:43.838 --> 43:46.798
I was, like, losing when I came
out in my swimsuit, whatever.

43:46.841 --> 43:49.191
But I started winning
when I started talking.

43:49.235 --> 43:50.540
I just started to shine.
- That's amazing.

43:50.584 --> 43:53.152
- It's so true.
- And that's how I won.

43:53.195 --> 43:54.632
It wasn't on beauty, really.

43:54.675 --> 43:56.068
- Actually it showed
your inner beauty within.

43:56.111 --> 43:57.809
- Kudos to you because--

43:57.852 --> 43:59.593
- But Miss Universe
was very different though.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.377
Miss Universe
was very different.

44:01.421 --> 44:03.641
- Oh, you weren't talking
about Miss Universe?

44:03.684 --> 44:05.512
- Hey, we're having
a conversation.

44:05.555 --> 44:08.689
This is not about
one person's perspective.

44:08.733 --> 44:12.475
I literally tried to jump in
maybe three or four times,

44:12.519 --> 44:16.392
and my friend Kenya
just kept talking over me.

44:18.003 --> 44:21.702
I was a judge for Miss Universe
in the Philippines and I--

44:21.746 --> 44:23.356
- I don't think
I was the best looking there.

44:23.399 --> 44:25.401
And that's how I won.

44:25.445 --> 44:27.142
- Listen--
- But I wasn't.

44:27.186 --> 44:28.491
I was, like,
not even in the top.

44:28.535 --> 44:30.406
- Kudos to you because--

44:30.450 --> 44:32.321
- But Miss Universe
was very different though.

44:32.365 --> 44:35.977
- That is offensive.
That is crazy.

44:36.021 --> 44:38.763
How do you think it feels
to judge you guys?

44:38.806 --> 44:40.678
Like, as a judge,
they sent us,

44:40.721 --> 44:42.505
like, a booklet
with all of the photos--

44:42.549 --> 44:44.725
- Girl, Miss India, oh, my gosh.
She was my best friend.

44:44.769 --> 44:46.161
- And all of their information.

44:46.205 --> 44:48.555
Like, I was saying,
as a judge for Miss Universe,

44:48.598 --> 44:50.383
it was, like, the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

44:50.426 --> 44:52.385
- Marc Anthony's wife
won that year.

44:52.428 --> 44:54.561
- There you go.
- Oh!

44:54.604 --> 44:56.041
- You would have been like,
"Oh, yeah."

44:56.084 --> 44:57.825
- Can I get three minutes?
- "That's the winner, girl."

44:57.869 --> 45:00.219
- Teresa, chill, please.

45:00.262 --> 45:01.394
- I thought we were going
to be like,

45:01.437 --> 45:02.961
"It's gonna be us and them."

45:03.004 --> 45:05.441
Like, literally I thought
it was gonna be like

45:05.485 --> 45:08.618
Thelma and Louise and the rest.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.404
And, um,

45:11.447 --> 45:14.233
Kenya obviously has
other plans, so...

45:14.276 --> 45:17.453
Seriously, I just have
one small thing to contribute

45:17.497 --> 45:18.759
to this pageant conversation.

45:18.803 --> 45:21.980
<i>- I remember when we...
- I wasn't done!</i>

45:33.861 --> 45:35.733
Cynthia, let's have a party.
- Okay.

45:35.776 --> 45:37.430
- Are you gonna party?
- All right, you guys.

45:37.473 --> 45:38.910
We probably have
a good hour left.

45:38.953 --> 45:40.389
- Come on.

45:40.433 --> 45:42.217
- I don't want
this wine anymore.

45:42.261 --> 45:44.959

- Uh-huh.

How do I make a drink?

45:51.923 --> 45:53.315
I don't know
how to make a drink.

45:53.359 --> 45:54.752
- Here's the thing, babe.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.101
Sometimes you gotta
just let it in.

45:56.144 --> 45:57.624
You gotta let the party in.
I think we're loose.

45:57.667 --> 46:00.279
People are dropping like flies.
- Not me.

is with a very handsome friend.

46:05.197 --> 46:07.416
- I'm making a freaking
homemade margarita, okay?

46:07.460 --> 46:09.636

how to make a margarita.

46:09.679 --> 46:11.812
That's the real reason
I'm calling you.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.422

46:13.466 --> 46:14.859
Next, I've got--

46:14.902 --> 46:16.338
- How much tequila?
How much Cointreau?

- Hold on.
- Lime juice.

Mother[bleep],
you have to measure it.

46:22.867 --> 46:23.911
Hold on.

46:23.955 --> 46:25.304
You have to listen
to the Mexican.

46:25.347 --> 46:26.696
- Okay, well, I don't know
- Everybody's so boring.

46:26.740 --> 46:28.002
