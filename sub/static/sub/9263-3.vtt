<i>The MRI shows a damage to the cord</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:04.602
<i>at the C7-T1 juncture.</i>

00:04.603 --> 00:07.536
I just want to know if I'm
gonna be able to walk again.

00:07.603 --> 00:09.070
Jason's paralyzed.

00:12.103 --> 00:14.536
You are Jason Street,
and I am Lyla Garrity.

00:14.613 --> 00:16.136
And everything is
going to work out

00:16.203 --> 00:18.669
just the way we planned it.

00:18.736 --> 00:20.569
<i>He's down on the ground.
He is down.</i>

00:20.636 --> 00:22.003
<i>Who is that, Street?</i>

00:22.075 --> 00:25.710
You think little Matt Saracen
can get it done?

00:27.100 --> 00:28.175
I don't want you thinking
out here.

00:28.235 --> 00:29.179
I want you to throw the ball.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.838
Dolia runs deep,
hit him deep.

00:31.009 --> 00:32.000
He's open on the break,
hit him on the break.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.563
You got four seconds
or a five-step drop!

00:33.638 --> 00:35.171
That's all you got.

00:35.237 --> 00:36.432
You up for this?

00:36.507 --> 00:38.402
Yes, sir.

from Panther Stadium,</i>

00:50.106 --> 00:51.232
<i> in Dillon, Texas.</i>

00:51.306 --> 00:52.601
<i>And we are ready
to play football.</i>

00:52.665 --> 00:55.563
<i>It was just a week ago
this town was rocked</i>

00:55.637 --> 00:58.603
<i>by the tragic injury to our
quarterback, Jason Street,</i>

00:58.667 --> 01:00.432
<i>a young man who embodied
the hopes and dreams</i>

01:00.505 --> 01:01.660
Jason, are you sure
you want to watch the game?

01:01.737 --> 01:02.661
I can just...

01:02.738 --> 01:04.360
Leave it, please.

01:04.436 --> 01:06.132
<i>Now, the question is,</i>

01:06.205 --> 01:08.033
<i>will Coach Taylor
be able to survive</i>

01:08.108 --> 01:10.031
<i>without his star quarterback?</i>

01:10.107 --> 01:14.303
<i>And can young Matt Saracen
step up to lead this team?</i>

01:14.367 --> 01:15.633
<i>Saracen's only taken
about three snaps</i>

01:15.706 --> 01:17.761
<i>his entire career..</i>

01:17.838 --> 01:19.561
<i>We're going with I right, power.</i>

01:19.638 --> 01:22.200
44 tomahawk, on one.
Ready, break.

01:22.276 --> 01:24.502
<i>Tonight, it's all about
the ground game.</i>

01:24.565 --> 01:26.101
<i>Coach Taylor's
gonna have to hope</i>

01:26.176 --> 01:28.132
<i>Saracen can get the ball
into the hands</i>

01:28.208 --> 01:30.603
<i>of their outstanding
running back Smash Williams,</i>

01:30.665 --> 01:32.301
<i>if the Panthers are gonna
have a shot.</i>

01:32.368 --> 01:33.563
Come on, Matt.

01:33.638 --> 01:35.360
<i>Saracen's into the count.</i>

01:35.438 --> 01:37.662
<i>Defense pushing in.
They're expecting run.</i>

01:37.736 --> 01:39.832
<i>He opens to the left,
hand off to Williams.</i>

01:39.906 --> 01:42.630
<i>Wait, Saracen keeps
on a bootleg.</i>

01:42.705 --> 01:44.932
<i>Oh, and he gets drilled
as he lets that ball go.</i>

01:45.005 --> 01:47.630
<i>He's got Dolia at the 45.</i>

01:47.707 --> 01:48.633
<i>He makes the catch.</i>

01:48.707 --> 01:49.871
<i>To the 40.</i>

01:49.936 --> 01:51.833
<i>What an inspired call
by Coach Taylor.</i>

01:51.908 --> 01:53.463
<i>He could go all the way!</i>

01:53.537 --> 01:54.561
Go.

01:54.638 --> 01:55.632
<i>He's to the 20,</i>

01:55.707 --> 01:57.030
<i>to the 15.</i>

01:57.107 --> 01:59.233
<i>I don't think
they're gonna catch him.</i>

01:59.305 --> 02:02.003
<i>Oh, Dolia gets stripped
at the 10-yard line.</i>

02:02.078 --> 02:05.532
<i>And the Rattlers come up
with the ball.</i>

02:05.606 --> 02:07.231
<i>What a gutsy call
by Coach Taylor,</i>

02:07.306 --> 02:11.231
<i>but, man, did that just
blow up in his face.</i>

02:11.307 --> 02:12.402
Execution!

02:12.467 --> 02:14.102
Where the hell's
the execution out there?!

02:14.175 --> 02:15.560
<i>Huh?!</i>

02:15.636 --> 02:17.301
My God, we oughta be
beating these bums

02:17.366 --> 02:19.270
by 40 points!

02:28.735 --> 02:29.803
Riggins,
you're supposed to be

02:29.877 --> 02:31.430
one of the toughest guys
in the district!

02:31.508 --> 02:34.001
They are handing your ass
to you, son!

02:34.077 --> 02:36.270
You better get your head
in the game.

02:36.338 --> 02:37.801
<i>Hut, hut!</i>

02:44.107 --> 02:46.970
Smash...north, south.
North, south.

02:47.035 --> 02:49.031
If you want to dance
with these boys out there,

02:49.107 --> 02:50.433
you invite them
to the prom!

02:50.505 --> 02:51.701
- They spottin' me every...
- What?!

02:51.767 --> 02:53.173
You got something to say to me?!

02:53.236 --> 02:55.001
Call some play-action
to open me up, Coach.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.002
- They see me coming.
- What?!

02:56.075 --> 02:58.802
I can't hear you.
What?!

02:58.876 --> 03:00.361
<i>Our Dillon Panthers
are runnin' out of time.</i>

03:00.435 --> 03:02.630
<i>Deep into the fourth quarter.</i>

03:02.708 --> 03:04.633
Come on, coach!
Run the football now!

03:04.707 --> 03:08.332
<i>There're only 15 seconds
left in this contest, folks.</i>

03:08.406 --> 03:09.973
<i>And it is third and goal
from the 9.</i>

03:10.035 --> 03:12.130
<i>The Panthers down by six points.</i>

03:12.207 --> 03:15.131
<i>And they have all but
self-destructed here tonight.</i>

03:15.208 --> 03:16.631
<i>Although you've got to
admire the courage</i>

03:16.707 --> 03:17.901
<i>of young Matt Saracen.</i>

03:17.976 --> 03:19.202
<i>This quarterback has really
played hard,</i>

03:19.275 --> 03:20.300
<i>with a lot of heart.</i>

03:20.406 --> 03:21.761
Read your defenses.

03:21.837 --> 03:23.072
Come on, Saracen.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.832
Hut!

03:24.907 --> 03:26.233
<i>Saracen on the fake.</i>

03:26.306 --> 03:27.531
<i>He drops back.
He's in trouble.</i>

03:27.606 --> 03:29.271
<i>He beats 'em
out around the right side.</i>

03:29.335 --> 03:30.433
<i>Oh, he's got legs on him.</i>

03:30.506 --> 03:31.502
<i>The 15, the 10.</i>

03:31.567 --> 03:33.203
<i>The 5.
He's gonna score.</i>

03:33.276 --> 03:34.461
<i>He's down to the 3.</i>

03:34.535 --> 03:36.402
<i>Bringing it hard
to the goal line.</i>

03:36.466 --> 03:38.530
<i>And dropped
right at the goal line.</i>

03:38.605 --> 03:39.700
<i>The Panthers are saying
touchdown,</i>

03:39.767 --> 03:42.233
<i>but we are gonna wait to see</i>

03:42.308 --> 03:44.332
<i>what the referee's call is.</i>

03:44.407 --> 03:46.400
<i>No touchdown.</i>

03:46.467 --> 03:48.603
Damn  it.
They had it.

03:48.666 --> 03:50.360
They had 'em beat.

03:50.437 --> 03:52.202
<i>That is it
for our Dillon Panthers.</i>

03:52.275 --> 03:53.530
<i>They have lost
a heartbreaker here,</i>

03:53.605 --> 03:55.302
<i>in a game that they should have</i>

03:55.367 --> 03:58.032
<i>easily dominated tonight.</i>

03:58.107 --> 03:59.933
<i>And I'll tell you,
Coach Taylor is off</i>

04:00.007 --> 04:01.132
<i>to a disastrous start</i>

04:01.207 --> 04:04.630
<i>this season, folks.</i>

04:04.705 --> 04:06.603
<i>Saracen!</i>

04:06.667 --> 04:08.332
That was a good game.

04:13.536 --> 04:15.601
But not good enough.

04:15.667 --> 04:19.003
Not nearly good enough!

05:13.636 --> 05:14.900
<i>It ain't hard, Tim.</i>

05:14.965 --> 05:16.262
<i>Hell, it's not
rocket science.</i>

05:19.066 --> 05:20.362
You beat the living dog snot

05:20.437 --> 05:21.632
out of those guys.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.563
You win the game,

05:24.637 --> 05:25.931
then you go out and you get yourself

05:25.998 --> 05:27.701
a little piece of tail.

05:27.768 --> 05:29.532
What part of that equation
don't you understand?

05:29.606 --> 05:31.232
You guys just bent over

05:31.295 --> 05:32.962
and grabbed your ankles.

05:33.035 --> 05:35.391
You shamed your good name.

05:35.466 --> 05:38.362
Yeah, I feel really awful
about that.

05:42.607 --> 05:43.832
Speaking of pieces of tail,

05:43.906 --> 05:46.530
Lyla Garrity.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.193
- You're not...
- What?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.291
I can't understand you when

05:53.366 --> 05:55.131
you're not moving your mouth,
Tim... you're not speaking.

05:58.905 --> 06:00.263
Hi, is Tim here?

06:00.337 --> 06:03.830
Uh, no.

06:03.908 --> 06:05.061
Not at the moment.

06:05.136 --> 06:07.262
Well, can you please tell him

06:07.338 --> 06:09.063
that Lyla Garrity stopped by?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.732
and I will be in the hospital

06:11.807 --> 06:14.292
with  his best friend
Jason Street!

06:14.367 --> 06:16.160
Today and tomorrow,

06:16.235 --> 06:18.090
and the next day, and so on.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.665
So whenever he wants
to visit is fine.

06:20.735 --> 06:22.909
But Jason is asking for him,

06:22.968 --> 06:25.768
so sooner is better.

06:25.839 --> 06:27.802
Could you please tell him that
when you see him?

06:27.866 --> 06:29.231
I'll give him
the message, sweetie.

06:29.297 --> 06:30.800
Thanks.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.760
Matt, I've been working
on this theory.

06:37.838 --> 06:38.803
You know what?

06:38.866 --> 06:39.993
Can you just
help me out?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.393
I really don't want
my grandmother to see this.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.602
Funny you should mention that,

06:42.667 --> 06:44.731
because she's at the core
of my theory.

06:44.806 --> 06:45.991
Tell me this.

06:46.068 --> 06:47.160
Dillon hasn't lost to South Milbank

06:47.237 --> 06:48.861
in what, like, 20 years?

06:48.936 --> 06:51.231
- 17.
- 17, right.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.800
So why do they lose now?

06:52.868 --> 06:54.093
No, I know what you're thinking,

06:54.168 --> 06:55.631
and that's not it.

06:55.705 --> 06:57.332
'Cause you know you played
a good game last night.

06:57.396 --> 06:58.831
I mean, that's not what
I'm talking about.

06:58.907 --> 07:02.262
What I'm talking about is
the supernatural.

07:02.337 --> 07:04.763
You're retarded.

07:04.836 --> 07:06.503
In a lot of cultures,
they believe older women

07:06.565 --> 07:08.231
to be very powerful witches.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.700
Oh, you think
my grandma is a witch.

07:09.766 --> 07:11.532
Look, my grandmother
can barely remember

07:11.607 --> 07:13.290
how to work the phone
half the time.

07:13.365 --> 07:15.532
How's she gonna put a spell
on the Dillon Panthers?

07:15.605 --> 07:16.763
Plus, why would she
put a spell...

07:16.837 --> 07:18.830
Matt?
Matt?

07:18.907 --> 07:20.360
What are y'all doin' out here?

07:20.436 --> 07:22.633
I'm just cleaning up
a little bit, Grandma.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.432
Oh, well, when you get done,

07:24.505 --> 07:27.360
I want you to go out back
and water the children.

07:27.438 --> 07:28.901
Y-You mean the flowers,
Grandma?

07:28.967 --> 07:29.862
Is that what you mean?

07:29.935 --> 07:30.932
Yeah.

07:30.997 --> 07:32.062
Just what I said, wasn't it?

07:37.137 --> 07:38.461
Hey, losers!

07:42.165 --> 07:44.293
Come on, you got it.
Lift it up.

07:44.365 --> 07:45.993
There you go, give it a shot.
Lift it up.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.360
Lift, lift, lift, lift, lift.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.802
Unh! All right.
All right.

07:50.868 --> 07:51.963
Relax.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.632
I want to do this again.
I can do it again.

07:53.705 --> 07:55.433
- You don't have to do it.
- I can do it.

07:55.508 --> 07:56.933
Not today.
Not today.

07:56.995 --> 07:59.463
Let's wait for tomorrow.
All right?

08:00.666 --> 08:02.663
Down you go.

08:02.738 --> 08:04.162
It's all right. Okay?

08:04.236 --> 08:05.902
Thank you.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.460
There you go.

08:07.538 --> 08:09.262
- All right, you good?
- Yes.

08:09.337 --> 08:11.901
Hey, baby.
Hey, Danielle.

08:11.968 --> 08:13.063
Hey, Lyla,
how you doing?

08:13.136 --> 08:14.191
Good. How are you?

08:14.268 --> 08:15.363
All right, Jason,
same time tomorrow?

08:15.437 --> 08:16.363
Yes, ma'am.

08:16.438 --> 08:18.760
- I'll be here.
- All right.

08:18.838 --> 08:20.390
Hi.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.960
Boy, were you missed
last night.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.230
We got spanked.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.630
It's like no one knew
what to do without you.

08:30.707 --> 08:32.131
I'll tell you what,
I would not wanna be

08:32.195 --> 08:34.633
Coach Taylor right now,
that is for sure.

08:34.707 --> 08:36.162
Just give him some time,
all right?

08:36.235 --> 08:38.090
He'll be fine.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.600
So,  we're expecting
a huge turnout

08:39.667 --> 08:42.063
for the pancake supper
tomorrow.

08:42.136 --> 08:43.462
The what?

08:43.535 --> 08:44.632
The pancake supper.
The benefit.

08:44.708 --> 08:45.902
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.032
To help with the cost
of the rehab facility.

08:48.098 --> 08:50.761
Yeah.

08:50.835 --> 08:52.630
It's exciting going
to that rehab place.

08:52.705 --> 08:54.290
You know why?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.832
Why is that?

08:55.907 --> 08:57.800
Because that's where you're
gonna get your legs back.

08:57.868 --> 08:59.460
Lyla...

08:59.536 --> 09:00.700
You and me,

09:00.765 --> 09:02.802
we can get through anything.

09:20.097 --> 09:21.330
What's up?

09:22.665 --> 09:24.902
- Oh--
- What?

09:24.967 --> 09:27.761
Um, excuse me.
Nurse?

09:27.836 --> 09:30.091
Lyla.

09:30.167 --> 09:31.730
Something's wet down there.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.162
Dolores,
what's going on?

09:33.238 --> 09:34.992
Excuse me.

09:35.066 --> 09:37.192
- Jason, it's your catheter.
- Oh, God.

09:37.266 --> 09:39.701
We're gonna take care of you.

09:39.765 --> 09:40.862
Can you give us a minute?

09:40.936 --> 09:41.902
Can you give us a minute?

09:41.967 --> 09:42.932
Um, I--

09:42.996 --> 09:44.632
Just a minute.
Go ahead.

09:46.968 --> 09:49.600
You're going to be fine, Jason.

09:57.937 --> 10:00.033
Hey.

10:00.097 --> 10:02.160
Tim.

10:02.237 --> 10:04.501
- Hey.
- How you doing, honey?

10:04.565 --> 10:07.963
Hi. I'm okay.

10:08.038 --> 10:09.330
How are--

10:09.398 --> 10:10.433
How are you and Mr. Street doing?

10:10.506 --> 10:13.803
We're, uh--
We're holding out.

10:13.868 --> 10:15.392
Jason's been asking about you.

10:15.465 --> 10:16.663
Yeah.

10:16.737 --> 10:20.163
I've been meaning to go
to see Jay, and--

10:20.235 --> 10:22.933
I know, you're busy
with football and all.

10:24.508 --> 10:27.133
Tim, just 'cause Jason's
in the hospital

10:27.197 --> 10:28.163
doesn't mean
you can't come over

10:28.237 --> 10:29.461
for Tuesday night dinner.

10:29.537 --> 10:33.030
Thank you ma'am.

10:33.095 --> 10:34.860
I'll, uh--

10:34.935 --> 10:36.660
I'll call you.

10:36.738 --> 10:39.502
Get some rest, okay?

10:39.567 --> 10:40.931
Take care of yourself.

10:40.998 --> 10:42.361
Yes,  ma'am.

10:42.436 --> 10:44.963
Am I gonna see you tonight
at the pancake supper?

10:45.037 --> 10:47.292
Yes, ma'am.

10:47.366 --> 10:49.233
Good.
Bye-bye, honey.

10:55.965 --> 10:57.561
I'll tell you what,
if she did let us get a dog,

10:57.636 --> 10:58.931
the kind of dog
we're gonna get

10:58.996 --> 11:00.603
is a brown Labrador.

11:00.666 --> 11:02.033
And if it's not
a brown Labrador,

11:02.096 --> 11:03.232
we're not getting a dog.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.702
Then we can name it,
like, Fluffy, or Spike.

11:04.766 --> 11:05.760
Hey, Jill.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.130
Two burgers, with bacon.

11:07.197 --> 11:08.431
Onion rings, Diet Coke.

11:08.506 --> 11:09.532
- Extra cheese.
- Spicy chicken

11:09.607 --> 11:11.502
sandwich for mom. Get Mom's--
And Dad's.

11:11.565 --> 11:12.530
Don't do it with
the three hamburgers.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.190
- Go sit down.
- Too much dead cow.

11:14.266 --> 11:16.600
She wants onion rings,
diet cola.

11:16.668 --> 11:19.433
Um, we need two burgers.

11:19.505 --> 11:21.862
I need a spicy chicken to go.

11:21.937 --> 11:26.430
And I'll have the biggest
French fries you have.

11:26.506 --> 11:28.501
You're Eric Taylor's girl, right?

11:28.566 --> 11:30.163
Uh, yeah.

11:30.237 --> 11:33.563
I was just wondering if y'all
had started packing yet.

11:33.638 --> 11:34.861
Uh...

11:34.935 --> 11:36.933
Things can get real
unpleasant around here

11:36.995 --> 11:39.191
when you lose.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.133
Can I help you?

11:42.738 --> 11:45.563
I was just telling her
how it works around here

11:45.636 --> 11:46.730
when you lose football games.

11:46.818 --> 11:48.501
If you got a problem,
you can talk to me.

11:48.566 --> 11:50.131
You don't have to talk
to my daughter about it.

11:50.195 --> 11:51.861
I do have a problem.

11:51.938 --> 11:54.031
I have a problem with you
pissing our season away

11:54.098 --> 11:56.292
calling them dumb-ass plays.

11:57.765 --> 12:00.363
I'm here with
my 15-year-old daughter.

12:00.435 --> 12:02.060
You know?

12:02.136 --> 12:04.433
So I'm just gonna
walk away right now.

12:04.508 --> 12:05.700
That's really great
of you, though.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.700
I sure appreciate that.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.863
Come on, let's go.

12:07.938 --> 12:09.700
You got no guts.

12:09.765 --> 12:11.532
See, that's why you ain't gonna
never have one of these.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.530
All right.

12:12.605 --> 12:13.661
Don't listen to him.

12:13.738 --> 12:15.993
Don't listen to that.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.533
You won't even finish out
the year here, Taylor.

12:17.608 --> 12:20.292
You will not last
one year.

12:25.485 --> 12:27.443
These are some big horses
we're running up against.

12:27.575 --> 12:31.720
Their offensive line averages
290 across the board.

12:32.178 --> 12:34.260
Matt, how big's
our biggest guy?

12:34.405 --> 12:36.363
Oh, Pudnick goes about 265.

12:36.496 --> 12:39.560
When you run up against
the biggest boy on the block,

12:39.616 --> 12:40.511
you gotta be faster.

12:40.697 --> 12:42.642
Velocity kills,
gentlemen.

12:42.686 --> 12:45.530
We need to be faster.
We will outlast them.

12:45.586 --> 12:47.743
We will go above and beyond.

12:50.326 --> 12:52.710
Smash, what the hell
you doin', son?

12:52.787 --> 12:54.251
Hey, Coach, look, listen.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.511
Me and the guys
have been talking.

12:55.585 --> 12:58.453
Look, we got a tough game
coming up.

12:58.517 --> 13:00.210
Shouldn't we work on
some hand-offs?

13:00.288 --> 13:01.381
Give our QB some practice?

13:01.458 --> 13:02.652
I mean, seriously,

13:02.718 --> 13:04.083
we gotta get that boy
up to speed.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.750
Maybe we should
get him a tutor.

13:07.058 --> 13:08.681
We all know what the problem is.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.683
Look, the guy's a weak link.

13:10.758 --> 13:12.852
I'll tell you what.
Everybody listen up!

13:12.916 --> 13:14.210
I was gonna let everyone

13:14.285 --> 13:16.151
get out of here early
this morning.

13:16.216 --> 13:17.283
But since you're
in such good shape,

13:17.355 --> 13:18.711
What do you say
we run five more?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.111
- Coach, are you--
- How 'bout ten extra ones?

13:22.186 --> 13:23.851
- I don't see how this--
- 15 more!

13:23.917 --> 13:24.910
I can count real high, Smash.

13:24.985 --> 13:26.680
How high do you think
I can count?

13:26.756 --> 13:28.951
You want to test me?!

13:29.016 --> 13:30.081
Let's go!

13:30.157 --> 13:31.283
Let's go!

13:31.356 --> 13:32.782
Pick it up!

13:32.858 --> 13:33.881
There he is.
There he is.

13:33.957 --> 13:36.013
You wanted to talk to me,
Mr. Garrity?

13:36.087 --> 13:39.212
Hello, Mr. Deitz,
how you doing?

13:39.285 --> 13:42.851
Well, so there's this
stud quarterback

13:42.915 --> 13:44.582
out of Louisiana.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.410
He's displaced.

13:46.487 --> 13:48.052
Katrina victim.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.783
And he's over here now.

13:49.855 --> 13:51.912
Name's Ray Tatom.

13:51.986 --> 13:54.380
Voodoo Tatom?

13:54.456 --> 13:56.283
You know him?

13:56.358 --> 13:57.553
I know of him.

13:57.615 --> 13:59.451
He's gonna be over
in Marlsboro

13:59.518 --> 14:01.111
Thursday afternoon.

14:01.187 --> 14:03.053
At that old lot over there,

14:03.115 --> 14:04.680
about 2:00.

14:04.758 --> 14:06.453
What I thought was
maybe you and I could

14:06.515 --> 14:07.750
just kind of
ease over there.

14:07.815 --> 14:09.353
You know, drive over there
and check him out.

14:09.418 --> 14:11.812
See if he lives up
to the hype.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.580
<i>Let's go, Smash!</i>

14:13.655 --> 14:16.850
<i>Get on there!
Pick it up!</i>

14:16.918 --> 14:18.312
Yes, sir.

14:21.488 --> 14:24.511
Hey, you get the napkins
and stuff?

14:24.588 --> 14:26.050
Yep, we're all set.
Good.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.050
We better hurry.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.251
All the girls are gonna
be there soon.

14:28.316 --> 14:29.250
If no one's there
to tell 'em what to do,

14:29.315 --> 14:30.650
they'll just fool around.

14:30.716 --> 14:33.981
Slow down.
There's time.

14:37.015 --> 14:40.312
So, your birthday's tomorrow.
What do you want to do?

14:40.386 --> 14:42.681
I'm having dinner with Jason
in the hospital.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.553
- Oh, honey...
- What?

14:44.616 --> 14:47.581
You've been spending
so much time there lately.

14:47.656 --> 14:49.050
I thought we could go out.

14:49.117 --> 14:51.110
No, Mom, it's already
all planned.

14:51.187 --> 14:52.253
Sorry.

14:53.758 --> 14:56.452
Lyla, are you sure this isn't all

14:56.515 --> 14:58.181
just too much?

14:58.257 --> 14:59.553
I mean, you're at the hospital

14:59.616 --> 15:01.013
every day.

15:01.087 --> 15:02.911
You'd do it for Dad,
wouldn't you?

15:02.986 --> 15:05.683
Well, yeah, but he's
my husband.

15:05.757 --> 15:09.511
Well, I'm marrying Jason
someday.

15:09.586 --> 15:11.181
Honey, you need to
accept the reality

15:11.257 --> 15:12.613
of the situation.

15:12.686 --> 15:15.052
I mean, this is a terrible thing

15:15.117 --> 15:17.981
that has happened.

15:18.057 --> 15:20.151
And  maybe you should
talk to someone.

15:20.215 --> 15:21.852
He's coming back
from this, okay?

15:21.916 --> 15:23.081
He just is.

15:23.155 --> 15:24.581
That's all there is to it.

15:24.655 --> 15:26.551
He needs me right now.

15:30.786 --> 15:32.783
<i>*people are saying that time*</i>

15:32.855 --> 15:35.552
<i>*Will take care of people like me*</i>

15:38.958 --> 15:40.813
<i>*Say I'm livin' too fast, boy"*</i>

15:40.888 --> 15:42.452
<i>*And no, I can't last*</i>

15:42.517 --> 15:44.182
<i>*For much longer* *</i>

15:48.317 --> 15:49.581
Yep, Matt, the river
of Rally Girls

15:49.655 --> 15:51.652
- has pretty much run dry.
- Will you shut up?

15:51.716 --> 15:53.151
Look at him go at it.

15:53.218 --> 15:54.810
Ew, gross.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.482
All right, wanna go get
a turkey burger?

15:57.555 --> 15:59.112
Hey, Julie, I got you
some soy sausage.

15:59.186 --> 16:00.412
Hey, Matt.

16:00.486 --> 16:02.410
Thank you, but I'm actually
on my way out.

16:02.486 --> 16:03.713
So you can have my pancakes.

16:03.786 --> 16:05.781
All right, I'll see you later.

16:05.858 --> 16:07.883
- All right.
- Bye.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.812
Damn.

16:09.888 --> 16:11.511
I heard about your new job.

16:11.588 --> 16:12.952
- Mm-hmm. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:13.018 --> 16:16.780
Jason Street is probably
never gonna play football again.

16:16.856 --> 16:18.653
You know about as well
as I do.

16:18.716 --> 16:22.082
And Matt Saracen is not
gonna take us to State.

16:22.158 --> 16:24.350
The last school counselor
killed herself.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.680
- That's right.
- I'm sorry?

16:25.756 --> 16:27.682
Yeah, she killed herself
with pills, I think.

16:27.758 --> 16:29.650
I was just thinking
it was about time

16:29.717 --> 16:31.851
for us to move
on the Katrina kid.

16:31.918 --> 16:33.480
Let me just say
one thing about that.

16:33.555 --> 16:34.912
I hope this is
on the up and up,

16:34.985 --> 16:36.480
because I really got
enough headaches going on

16:36.558 --> 16:37.510
right now as it is.

16:37.585 --> 16:38.652
Just let me handle it..

16:38.718 --> 16:40.250
I just need you to
look at the tapes for me,

16:40.315 --> 16:41.481
if you will.

16:41.557 --> 16:43.512
Will you just look
at the tape, Coach?

16:43.585 --> 16:44.811
Just look at it for me.

16:44.887 --> 16:47.051
All right. All right.

16:52.218 --> 16:53.352
Good. Look who it is.

16:53.415 --> 16:55.510
My little ray of sunshine.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.150
Not now, Smash.
Have you seen Tim?

16:57.217 --> 16:58.512
He said he was gonna be here.

16:58.587 --> 17:00.350
No, I haven't seen Rig.

17:00.418 --> 17:02.311
He probably passed out
cold somewhere.

17:02.385 --> 17:04.109
Let's talk about us.

17:04.186 --> 17:07.079
I don't think so.

17:28.457 --> 17:30.452
Hey, dumb-ass.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.580
Just gonna ignore me?

17:32.658 --> 17:34.310
Think I'll go away?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.110
That's what I keep hoping,

17:37.186 --> 17:39.652
but you don't seem to want
to get the message.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.853
You know, you're such
a big tough guy.

17:43.917 --> 17:46.151
You can't even go see Jason
in the hospital.

17:46.217 --> 17:48.511
I mean, damn, it, Tim,
grow a set, why don't you!

17:48.585 --> 17:51.480
'Cause we both know
that's what this is all about.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.581
Hey, Tyra.

17:57.657 --> 17:59.113
How's Smash?

18:00.787 --> 18:02.750
Was he good?
Did you have a nice time?

18:02.817 --> 18:06.850
Nothing happened.
Not really.

18:06.918 --> 18:08.553
Besides, don't pretend like
you haven't slept with

18:08.617 --> 18:10.112
half the Rally Girls.

18:10.187 --> 18:13.310
We sure do have
something special here, Tyra.

18:13.385 --> 18:14.453
You know,
maybe you're right.

18:14.516 --> 18:17.013
Maybe I am wasting my time.

18:17.088 --> 18:19.051
'Cause you are just another
mediocre football player.

18:19.117 --> 18:21.652
who's gonna grow up
to drink himself to death.

18:21.715 --> 18:23.551
Maybe we should just
end this right now.

18:23.617 --> 18:25.283
I'll see you around then.

18:25.357 --> 18:28.350
I am serious, Tim.
Are you listening to me?

18:28.415 --> 18:29.452
If I get in that car
right now,

18:29.516 --> 18:30.413
I'm never coming back.

18:30.488 --> 18:32.012
Do you understand?

18:32.088 --> 18:33.750
I get it.

18:33.817 --> 18:35.782
That's it?

18:35.857 --> 18:38.550
Breaking up for real,
and that's all you have to say.

18:38.616 --> 18:41.552
That was great

18:57.858 --> 18:59.183
All right, Tatom can
throw the ball.

18:59.257 --> 19:01.583
Can he scramble under pressure?

19:01.656 --> 19:03.282
Keep watching.

19:03.358 --> 19:05.611
Kid's team went to the state
championship last year.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.353
Broke three tackles
on a 40-yard touchdown.

19:08.418 --> 19:11.111
You've seen this tape already?

19:11.186 --> 19:13.480
Yeah, I was over
at Buddy's last weekend.

19:13.555 --> 19:17.181
Barbecue.

19:17.255 --> 19:21.152
I didn't know y'all
were such good friends.

19:26.088 --> 19:27.182
Hey, Tim.

19:27.258 --> 19:29.380
Here's that paper on East of Eden.

19:29.458 --> 19:30.453
I misspelled a bunch
of the words

19:30.515 --> 19:32.282
so this time,
it'll look like yours.

19:32.358 --> 19:34.811
And your biology homework
is on the bottom.

19:34.886 --> 19:37.010
Thanks.

19:37.085 --> 19:39.511
So I heard that you
and Tyra broke up.

19:39.585 --> 19:41.183
Is it true?

19:41.256 --> 19:44.483
I suppose it is.
Yeah.

19:44.556 --> 19:46.311
Hey, Tim.

19:46.387 --> 19:48.912
<i>Bye, Lyla.</i>

19:48.986 --> 19:52.453
Tim? Hey.

19:54.156 --> 19:55.882
We're having
a prayer meeting

19:55.958 --> 19:57.282
for Jason this afternoon.

19:57.357 --> 19:58.283
You wanna come?

19:58.355 --> 20:01.582
What are we
praying for, Lyla?

20:01.656 --> 20:03.611
A new spine for Jay?

20:05.717 --> 20:07.081
Tim.

20:07.156 --> 20:09.780
I know you never do anything
you don't want to do,

20:09.855 --> 20:11.483
and I guess that's fine.

20:11.556 --> 20:13.652
But don't insult me.

20:23.618 --> 20:25.383
Excuse me, Mrs. Taylor?

20:25.457 --> 20:26.410
Hey, Matt.

20:26.487 --> 20:29.153
- Hey--oh.
- Come on in.

20:29.215 --> 20:30.210
We'll do--
We'll do the rest later?

20:30.285 --> 20:31.450
Yes, thank you.

20:31.518 --> 20:32.410
Hey, Matt,
how are you?

20:32.488 --> 20:34.151
How's it going?

20:34.216 --> 20:36.183
I need to drop pre-calculus,

20:36.255 --> 20:37.952
so that I can go
to morning practices.

20:38.017 --> 20:39.582
Oh, okay.

20:39.657 --> 20:41.753
When are you gonna take
pre-calculus?

20:41.818 --> 20:44.912
Uh, next semester,
I guess,

20:44.986 --> 20:46.080
when football is done.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.511
All right, as long as
you take it.

20:48.586 --> 20:49.953
Yeah, I'm gonna take it.

20:50.018 --> 20:51.012
You sure?

20:51.085 --> 20:52.452
Yeah.

20:52.515 --> 20:53.983
Okay.

20:54.057 --> 20:56.881
I know I saw drop cards
somewhere.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.012
How have you been doing?

20:58.088 --> 20:59.111
How are you holding up
through all this?

20:59.188 --> 21:00.682
It's been kind of
a crazy time, has--

21:00.757 --> 21:03.211
Drop card!
Here you go.

21:03.287 --> 21:04.351
You can fill that out.
I'll sign it.

21:04.418 --> 21:06.013
Yeah, we're gonna do
a lot better

21:06.087 --> 21:08.212
against Arnett Mead,
so, you know,

21:08.285 --> 21:09.850
don't worry about that.

21:09.915 --> 21:11.453
No, but what I mean is
how are you doing?

21:11.516 --> 21:12.681
I mean, you know.

21:12.755 --> 21:14.512
I know your dad's in Iraq,

21:14.585 --> 21:16.310
and that you're living
with your grandma, right?

21:16.385 --> 21:18.511
Yeah, uh, I'm fine.

21:18.585 --> 21:20.651
I mean, Grandma's
going through

21:20.716 --> 21:22.180
one of her good spells
right now.

21:22.258 --> 21:24.281
So that's--
that's good.

21:24.357 --> 21:26.080
There are bad spells sometimes?

21:26.157 --> 21:27.552
I mean, nothing, really.

21:27.618 --> 21:30.081
Just, like, she gets
a little loopy sometimes.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.881
I mean, she'll
put the ice cream

21:31.955 --> 21:33.650
in the cupboard.

21:33.715 --> 21:34.912
Or forget to take her medication,

21:34.986 --> 21:36.111
that kind of stuff.

21:36.187 --> 21:38.312
It's really not--
It's not a big deal.

21:38.385 --> 21:39.752
Is it your responsibility

21:39.816 --> 21:41.883
to make sure she takes
her medication?

21:41.957 --> 21:45.883
Well, there's really
no one else around, so--

21:45.958 --> 21:48.212
Boy, you got a lot on your plate.

21:48.288 --> 21:49.980
I mean, I think
just football itself

21:50.057 --> 21:51.551
is more than
a full-time job.

21:51.617 --> 21:52.651
Yeah, well, I mean,

21:52.718 --> 21:54.213
I really love playing football.

21:54.288 --> 21:58.083
So I just hope
I get to keep playing.

21:58.155 --> 21:59.382
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.181
You're doing a great job.

22:01.258 --> 22:03.251
Yeah, but I keep hearing
that, like, they're trying

22:03.316 --> 22:05.011
to bring in this Katrina
refugee, or something.

22:05.088 --> 22:07.683
This quarterback
from New Orleans.

22:09.258 --> 22:11.410
I never heard anything
about that.

22:11.487 --> 22:13.251
Keep your head up.
Keep your head up.

22:16.515 --> 22:18.211
Come on, Riggins, let's go.

22:18.287 --> 22:20.312
Hold on to that ball.

22:20.388 --> 22:21.953
Come on, keep digging your legs.

22:22.016 --> 22:24.150
Come on, son.
What's your problem?

22:24.217 --> 22:25.153
You do it again.

22:25.217 --> 22:26.283
Keep your legs moving.

22:26.356 --> 22:28.481
Keep your head up.
Keep digging.

22:29.855 --> 22:31.410
Come on, son, let's go.

22:31.487 --> 22:33.413
Let's go!

22:35.858 --> 22:39.211
Keep your head up.
Keep digging your legs.

22:39.285 --> 22:40.711
Keep your head up.
Keep digging.

22:40.788 --> 22:44.611
Get over here.
Come here.

22:44.687 --> 22:47.111
I don't see you preparing
for this game, son.

22:47.187 --> 22:48.783
You go hard or you go home.

22:48.858 --> 22:49.980
Come on, now, you're out here,

22:50.056 --> 22:52.410
you give 110%, like everybody else.

22:52.485 --> 22:53.711
You give 110% all the time.

22:53.786 --> 22:56.350
Not just when you feel like it.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.180
Now, come on, son, do it again.

22:58.255 --> 23:00.480
Let's do it again.

23:09.918 --> 23:12.281
Don't do it, son.

23:12.356 --> 23:14.213
Don't do that.

23:14.287 --> 23:16.880
Don't do what I think
you're about to do.

23:17.987 --> 23:18.981
Don't do that.

23:19.058 --> 23:20.082
You don't want
to do that.

23:20.155 --> 23:21.811
Son, don't--

23:23.355 --> 23:24.983
Let him go, Coach.

23:26.286 --> 23:28.982
Listen, he's been watching
the game film

23:29.055 --> 23:30.353
from when Street got hurt.

23:30.416 --> 23:31.950
I have a feeling he thinks
it's all his fault.

23:32.018 --> 23:34.182
What the hell would he think
it's his fault for?

23:34.256 --> 23:35.551
I don't know,
maybe he thought

23:35.616 --> 23:37.082
he might have made
the tackle, or something.

23:37.157 --> 23:38.951
The kid was 30 yards away.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.880
Hey, hey, Coach, listen.

23:40.956 --> 23:42.612
You can blame yourself
for just about anything,

23:42.688 --> 23:44.251
if you think about it
long enough.

23:50.018 --> 23:51.781
Hey, Coach.

23:51.855 --> 23:54.512
Coach. What was that?

23:54.588 --> 23:57.051
Did I just see Tim Riggins
just walk off practice?

23:57.115 --> 23:58.250
You know, that is one thing
that never,

23:58.315 --> 24:00.813
ever would have happened
in the old days.

24:00.888 --> 24:01.812
Ever, you think?

24:01.886 --> 24:03.113
- No.
- No way.

24:03.188 --> 24:04.852
But you know, times have
changed, I guess, huh?

24:04.916 --> 24:06.851
What can I do for you, Buddy?

24:06.918 --> 24:08.651
Well, I just wanted to see
if you want to go with us

24:08.715 --> 24:10.450
over to, you know,
talk to that kid.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.510
That Ray Tatom kid.

24:12.587 --> 24:14.682
Matt Saracen may be
a wild card.

24:14.755 --> 24:16.452
You know one thing I like
about Matt Saracen?

24:16.516 --> 24:18.051
- What's that?
- I don't have to be worried

24:18.115 --> 24:19.181
about recruiting violations.

24:19.258 --> 24:20.413
Who said anything
about recruiting?

24:20.486 --> 24:21.681
I didn't say
anything about recruiting.

24:21.756 --> 24:24.380
This is about that kid
whose whole family

24:24.455 --> 24:26.410
has lost everything--
devastated by Katrina.

24:26.486 --> 24:27.410
It'll help us out,

24:27.486 --> 24:28.910
And we can help him out.
That's all.

24:28.985 --> 24:30.381
That's all there is to it.

24:30.457 --> 24:31.852
I mean, it's a win-win
situation.

24:31.918 --> 24:33.683
Right, Mac?

24:45.285 --> 24:46.282
Whoa! Hey, Coach.

24:46.358 --> 24:47.283
Buddy.

24:47.358 --> 24:49.111
Coach.

24:51.417 --> 24:53.380
<i>What'd I tell you?</i>

24:53.455 --> 24:55.010
I told you he'd be there.

24:55.088 --> 24:56.282
Here it is.

24:56.358 --> 24:57.751
We're here, Vic.

24:57.818 --> 24:59.553
You and everybody else.

24:59.616 --> 25:02.251
Come on in.

25:02.316 --> 25:03.880
Good to see you.

25:03.957 --> 25:05.712
Hey, Voodoo.

25:05.788 --> 25:06.751
Coach.

25:06.816 --> 25:08.051
Good to see you.

25:08.117 --> 25:09.880
How are you, son?

25:10.917 --> 25:12.981
Look here.

25:13.058 --> 25:16.211
This boy and his family have
been through a terrible time.

25:16.286 --> 25:18.410
They lost everything in Katrina.

25:18.487 --> 25:19.583
And they've been bouncing around

25:19.658 --> 25:20.882
from place to place ever since.

25:20.956 --> 25:22.451
The people of Dillon, Texas,

25:22.516 --> 25:23.980
are here
to open their hearts.

25:24.058 --> 25:25.981
We might be able
to provide housing.

25:26.055 --> 25:29.212
Very fine,
very comfortable housing.

25:29.288 --> 25:31.513
They need a fresh start.

25:31.588 --> 25:34.781
We might be able to
get Mr. Tatom over there

25:34.856 --> 25:36.411
a nice new job.

25:37.517 --> 25:39.180
We could arrange that.

25:39.255 --> 25:41.551
We might also even be able to

25:41.615 --> 25:44.351
arrange a little fund.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.611
You know, from some of
the local businesses.

25:46.687 --> 25:49.451
Might be able to help a family

25:49.518 --> 25:51.150
get back up on its feet.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.510
We could set you up.

25:53.585 --> 25:56.310
The town of Dillon
is a generous town.

25:56.385 --> 25:58.010
It's a fine town.

25:58.085 --> 25:59.082
It's a good place
to call home.

25:59.156 --> 26:01.010
He gets a guarantee to start?

26:01.086 --> 26:03.353
Oh, yeah. That's right.

26:03.417 --> 26:04.410
Right, Coach?

26:04.487 --> 26:05.410
You know what, Buddy?

26:05.488 --> 26:06.451
Actually, I got
a problem with that.

26:06.516 --> 26:07.682
I got a problem with that.

26:07.757 --> 26:09.982
Well, now, you know,

26:10.057 --> 26:11.553
the coach and I can work
on the details later.

26:11.617 --> 26:14.383
The point is, you want to
go all the way, son?

26:14.455 --> 26:16.082
I am going all the way.

26:16.156 --> 26:17.883
You want to play college ball,
go to the pros?

26:17.957 --> 26:19.480
That's the idea.

26:19.556 --> 26:21.382
Then you want to be with
the number one team in Texas.

26:21.458 --> 26:25.552
Your representation can squeeze
all it can out of this.

26:25.616 --> 26:26.583
But it's not about new cars
and start-up money.

26:26.656 --> 26:28.681
This is about your future.

26:28.758 --> 26:30.112
And starting positions aren't
handed out in motel rooms.

26:30.185 --> 26:31.252
They're earned on the field.

26:31.316 --> 26:34.511
You want to play
with Arnett Mead, fine.

26:34.585 --> 26:36.083
They're gonna have a short season.

26:38.885 --> 26:41.012
- It's your choice.
- Ma'am.

26:41.086 --> 26:42.210
It was nice to meet you.

26:42.288 --> 26:46.551
I wish all the luck
to your family.

26:50.586 --> 26:52.613
I am telling you
I need some help here.

26:52.686 --> 26:54.411
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to do?

26:54.488 --> 26:56.082
I want you to talk to her.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.441
<i>You know, I love
how you can find time</i>

26:58.515 --> 27:00.080
<i>to take an 80-mile road trip</i>

27:00.145 --> 27:01.812
<i>if the Dillon Panthers
need something.</i>

27:01.885 --> 27:03.083
<i>But if your own daughter--</i>

27:03.145 --> 27:04.940
<i>Hey, hey, she is gonna be fine.</i>

27:05.017 --> 27:06.310
<i>She's a smart girl.</i>

27:06.387 --> 27:07.913
<i>She's got a good head on her shoulders.</i>

27:07.985 --> 27:09.182
How is she fine?

27:09.248 --> 27:10.711
<i>She's living in
a fantasy land..</i>

27:10.786 --> 27:12.483
<i>She's not thinking
about college.</i>

27:12.545 --> 27:14.141
She's not thinking
about her own future.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.910
I mean, what's she gonna do?

27:15.986 --> 27:17.580
<i>She's put all her eggs
in one basket,</i>

27:17.647 --> 27:19.580
<i>and I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you and I let her.</i>

27:19.648 --> 27:21.141
<i>Just give it some time.</i>

27:21.217 --> 27:23.482
<i>'Cause she'll get bored,
and she'll move on.</i>

27:23.547 --> 27:25.081
<i>- Mm-hmm. She will.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

27:29.217 --> 27:31.312
<i>- Hey.
-Hey, kids.</i>

27:31.386 --> 27:32.310
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

27:32.386 --> 27:34.043
Did you eat any dinner?

27:34.117 --> 27:35.980
Uh, no, I didn't.

27:36.048 --> 27:37.313
But I think I can
find something here.

27:37.385 --> 27:38.683
There's chicken in there.

27:39.547 --> 27:40.511
Hey, you didn't tell me

27:40.786 --> 27:41.780
that y'all are getting
a new quarterback

27:42.048 --> 27:42.811
from New Orleans.

27:44.485 --> 27:45.582
Where did you hear that?

27:45.947 --> 27:49.813
Well, Matt Saracen
came in today.

27:49.886 --> 27:52.083
He's feeling real
stressed out about it.

27:52.146 --> 27:53.281
Really?

27:53.348 --> 27:54.381
Matt Saracen's under
a lot of pressure, huh?

27:54.447 --> 27:55.680
Yeah.

27:55.748 --> 27:57.742
Maybe I should go over
to Matt Saracen's house

27:57.817 --> 27:59.182
and make him some Omaltine,

27:59.246 --> 28:00.680
read him a bedtime story.

28:00.746 --> 28:01.843
I think you might want
to just try

28:01.917 --> 28:03.841
a little compassion with him.

28:07.285 --> 28:09.641
- Bye, Daddy.
- Hey, kiddo.

28:11.348 --> 28:12.640
You don't need to be sarcastic.

28:12.717 --> 28:14.441
You know what I think?

28:14.515 --> 28:16.311
I think everybody
in this town is telling me

28:16.386 --> 28:17.682
how to do my job.

28:17.745 --> 28:19.111
And the one thing I think
those kids don't need

28:19.187 --> 28:20.140
is that they don't need compassion.

28:20.216 --> 28:21.582
That's what I think.

28:21.647 --> 28:22.812
You want to know
what else I think?

28:22.885 --> 28:24.510
What they do need to do
is they need to win.

28:24.587 --> 28:25.941
And something else.

28:26.018 --> 28:28.341
You and I,
we need to win, Tami.

28:28.417 --> 28:29.981
We need to win.

28:30.047 --> 28:32.080
Honey, there's Smash.

28:32.385 --> 28:33.640
<i>Channel 13 Sports here
at Hermann Field,</i>

28:33.717 --> 28:35.140
<i>where the Panthers had
a great season last year.</i>

28:35.215 --> 28:39.211
<i>Hopefully they'll repeat
that success this year.</i>

28:39.286 --> 28:40.580
<i>Been a lot of talk
around Dillon</i>

28:40.645 --> 28:42.313
<i>that Taylor's not
the right guy for the job.</i>

28:42.388 --> 28:44.010
<i>Oh, see, look, man,</i>

28:44.087 --> 28:45.412
<i>I can't even mess with you.</i>

28:45.486 --> 28:46.511
You're already trying
to get me in trouble.

28:46.588 --> 28:47.712
<i>Oh, no.</i>

28:47.788 --> 28:49.140
<i>I just want to know where you stand.</i>

28:49.216 --> 28:50.780
<i>Come on, you must have
an opinion.</i>

28:50.845 --> 28:53.480
<i>Oh, yeah, I got an opinion.</i>

28:53.547 --> 28:54.512
<i>I mean, I would,
if I were you.</i>

28:54.586 --> 28:55.541
You've got a lot to lose,

28:55.615 --> 28:57.813
<i>if the coach mismanages
this team.</i>

28:57.886 --> 28:59.280
<i>Look, off the record,</i>

28:59.345 --> 29:00.410
<i>I just think Coach T
ought to be</i>

29:00.487 --> 29:01.511
<i>winning football games.</i>

29:01.587 --> 29:02.583
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

29:02.647 --> 29:03.883
<i>See, I knew you had an opinion
about how things were going.</i>

29:05.187 --> 29:06.380
Let it go.

29:06.446 --> 29:07.783
How do you feel
about Friday night?

29:09.545 --> 29:10.543
He's a stupid kid, honey.

29:10.546 --> 29:12.041
Let it go.

29:12.046 --> 29:15.813
Eric, what are you doing?

29:15.885 --> 29:17.083
Just let it go.

29:17.147 --> 29:18.783
Come on.

29:18.848 --> 29:20.311
Mac, I want--

29:20.386 --> 29:22.581
Yes, I did just see it.

29:22.646 --> 29:24.710
I want you to
get the team together,

29:24.787 --> 29:26.282
and I want you to meet me
at the field house

29:26.347 --> 29:28.741
in a half an hour.

29:28.818 --> 29:30.381
Yes, Mac, I know what time it is.

29:30.447 --> 29:33.242
Mac, meet me at the field house
in half an hour.

29:33.316 --> 29:35.543
Thank you.

29:38.518 --> 29:39.743
Bye.

29:39.815 --> 29:41.912
You guys have a nice night now.

29:46.015 --> 29:47.443
Who's calling so late?

29:47.515 --> 29:49.541
Who's calling so late?

29:49.615 --> 29:53.210
I got--
I got it.

29:53.287 --> 29:54.640
Hello?

29:54.715 --> 29:56.343
Now?

29:57.646 --> 30:01.413
Coach is on the phone for you.

30:09.787 --> 30:12.483
Hey...you better
get dressed.

30:14.017 --> 30:15.780
Somebody gonna get that?

30:17.417 --> 30:20.042
Noannie, get the door!

30:21.715 --> 30:23.743
Hi, sweetie.

30:26.247 --> 30:27.310
You get yourself dressed.

30:27.388 --> 30:28.382
We're going on
a little field trip.

30:28.446 --> 30:30.081
I'll see you in the car
in two minutes.

30:30.148 --> 30:33.580
You tell your mother
I say hello.

30:42.916 --> 30:44.612
What's goin' on?

30:44.685 --> 30:47.343
I have no idea.

30:54.748 --> 30:56.543
Let's go.
Everybody off the bus.

30:56.616 --> 30:58.410
Let'go, gentlemen.
Let's go!

30:58.485 --> 31:00.281
What's he gonna do,
kill us all?

31:00.348 --> 31:01.282
Maybe.

31:01.345 --> 31:02.810
Move 'em out.

31:02.885 --> 31:05.011
Line 'em up!
Line 'em up!

31:05.087 --> 31:07.541
Wind sprints,
up and down the hill.

31:07.617 --> 31:09.081
Let's go.
Let's go.

31:09.146 --> 31:12.742
Go, move it, come on.

31:15.548 --> 31:17.512
If you think you're champions

31:17.586 --> 31:19.981
because you wear
the Panther uniform,

31:20.047 --> 31:21.443
you're wrong!

31:21.517 --> 31:23.310
If you think you're champions

31:23.388 --> 31:25.683
because they give you
a piece of pie at the diner,

31:25.746 --> 31:27.413
you're wrong!

31:27.486 --> 31:29.310
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

31:30.845 --> 31:35.181
Champions don't complain!

31:35.248 --> 31:36.711
Champions don't give up!

31:38.945 --> 31:41.142
Let's go, Coach.
Send 'em now!

31:44.086 --> 31:46.082
Champions don't give up!

31:46.147 --> 31:48.710
Champions don't complain!

31:48.785 --> 31:51.113
Champions give 200%!

31:53.918 --> 31:57.740
You're not champions
until you've earned it!

32:09.888 --> 32:11.513
Turn around.
Don't stay in them bushes.

32:15.348 --> 32:18.740
Let's go! Let's go!
There you go. Let's go.

32:28.348 --> 32:29.840
Coach, don't you think
maybe they've had enough?

32:29.917 --> 32:31.781
I'll say when
they've had enough.

32:45.045 --> 32:46.380
Clear eyes...

32:46.447 --> 32:48.481
full hearts...

32:48.547 --> 32:50.713
can't lose!

32:50.788 --> 32:53.843
Clear eyes...
full hearts...

32:53.916 --> 32:55.243
can't lose!

32:55.317 --> 32:56.743
Clear eyes,

32:56.816 --> 32:57.843
Clear eyes,
full hearts,

32:57.918 --> 32:58.880
can't lose!

32:58.948 --> 33:02.041
Clear eyes,
full hearts,

33:02.117 --> 33:03.112
can't lose!

33:03.185 --> 33:04.343
Clear eyes,

33:04.416 --> 33:06.480
full hearts,
can't lose!

33:06.547 --> 33:07.541
Can't lose!

33:07.617 --> 33:09.783
Go!

33:19.928 --> 33:20.890
Cute movie, right?

33:20.958 --> 33:24.090
It was a pretty
sad birthday, huh?

33:24.156 --> 33:26.893
No, it wasn't.

33:26.956 --> 33:29.452
This was exactly
what I wanted, Jason.

33:31.058 --> 33:33.190
Anyway, we'll go
to dinner next year.

33:33.258 --> 33:34.420
When you're all better.

33:34.496 --> 33:36.750
When I'm better?

33:36.825 --> 33:37.820
Lyla, I don't know if you noticed,

33:37.896 --> 33:38.950
but I'm not getting any better.

33:39.028 --> 33:40.220
Can't you see that?

33:40.295 --> 33:42.622
Come on, Jason,
you gotta have faith.

33:42.696 --> 33:43.890
Lyla, stop.

33:43.957 --> 33:47.893
Jason...listen to me.

33:47.956 --> 33:50.352
This is just
a little hiccup.

33:52.455 --> 33:53.793
That's all.

33:53.858 --> 33:55.321
It's a year.

33:55.397 --> 33:57.091
In one year, you'll be
back on track.

33:57.155 --> 33:58.192
Lyla, stop it.

33:58.255 --> 33:59.491
- You will go to Notre Dame--
- Stop it!

33:59.557 --> 34:00.621
Stop!

34:01.957 --> 34:04.622
My legs are never gonna get better.

34:05.855 --> 34:06.793
Ever.

34:06.858 --> 34:10.452
But there are cases,
lots of cases--

34:10.527 --> 34:12.592
And those cases aren't me.

34:12.657 --> 34:14.290
All right?

34:14.356 --> 34:15.692
I don't even have
full use of my hands.

34:15.755 --> 34:17.221
I'll be lucky
if I get that back.

34:17.295 --> 34:19.451
I can't even put
my own shoes on and off.

34:19.527 --> 34:20.851
How can you not see that?!

34:20.927 --> 34:22.092
What the hell is wrong with you?!

34:22.155 --> 34:24.321
I'm just trying to help.

34:24.397 --> 34:25.690
Yeah, well, you're not helping!
You want to help?

34:25.755 --> 34:26.951
Then stop pretending
that everything's okay!

34:27.025 --> 34:29.452
Why are you getting so mad?

34:29.527 --> 34:31.652
Because every night
when I go to sleep,

34:31.728 --> 34:34.721
I dream that
I can walk again.

34:34.797 --> 34:37.922
And every morning,
I wake up,

34:37.998 --> 34:40.891
and I have to accept it
all over again.

34:40.956 --> 34:42.750
And then you walk in here,

34:42.826 --> 34:45.092
all smiles, and acting
like nothing's wrong.

34:45.155 --> 34:46.620
And it's killing me!

34:46.695 --> 34:48.121
So get this through your head.

34:48.195 --> 34:49.192
All right?

34:49.255 --> 34:51.722
My life as we knew it--
over.

34:51.797 --> 34:53.449
Don't say that, Jason.

34:53.527 --> 34:54.822
Football--over.

34:54.897 --> 34:57.591
Notre Dame, going pro,
all that--gone.

34:57.655 --> 34:59.321
You and me?

34:59.395 --> 35:01.092
We're not getting married.

35:03.256 --> 35:06.290
So I need you to do
something for me, all right?

35:06.358 --> 35:08.721
Get out.

35:08.796 --> 35:10.491
Get out!

35:10.558 --> 35:12.050
Don't just look at me,
go!

35:16.895 --> 35:19.350
I'll be back tomorrow
for when they...

35:19.428 --> 35:22.290
transfer you to the rehab facility.

35:38.726 --> 35:42.052
What happened to Jason Street
was nobody's fault.

35:42.128 --> 35:43.950
This is football.
Things happen.

35:44.026 --> 35:45.920
It was an accident.
You understand me?

35:45.996 --> 35:49.252
I didn't even try, Coach.
I didn't even--

35:49.327 --> 35:50.692
You were on the other side
of the field.

35:50.757 --> 35:51.822
It wouldn't have mattered.

35:51.898 --> 35:54.292
It was an accident.

35:54.357 --> 35:56.420
It was not your fault.

35:56.498 --> 35:58.651
Look at me.

35:58.726 --> 36:01.351
I want you to let yourself
off the hook, son.

36:01.428 --> 36:03.451
I want you to let yourself
off the hook.

36:03.527 --> 36:04.492
Yes, sir.

36:04.557 --> 36:06.223
Be smart.

36:06.298 --> 36:09.151
Yes, sir.

36:10.555 --> 36:13.493
Now, you ever walk out
of one of my practices again,

36:13.556 --> 36:16.452
and I will kick your ass
off the team.

36:16.526 --> 36:18.523
That's a promise.
Understood?

36:18.598 --> 36:19.693
Yes, sir.

36:19.757 --> 36:23.323
You owe me a practice.

36:23.396 --> 36:25.453
You walk home.

36:25.527 --> 36:28.492
We'll call it even.

36:30.427 --> 36:31.851
Coach.

36:48.695 --> 36:53.691
<i>* If I keep holding out *</i>

36:53.755 --> 36:57.551
<i>* Will the light shine through? *</i>

36:57.627 --> 37:01.421
<i>* Under this broken roof *</i>

37:01.496 --> 37:03.422
<i>* It's only rain...*</i>

37:04.206 --> 37:07.292
What are you doing here?
Do you want a ride?

37:08.357 --> 37:10.900
Isn't it past
your bedtime, Lyla?

37:14.996 --> 37:19.223
<i>* Come back *</i>

37:19.295 --> 37:23.320
<i>* I have been planning on... *</i>

37:24.006 --> 37:25.853
What, are you drunk again?

37:25.925 --> 37:27.792
Soon enough, Lyla.

37:28.058 --> 37:29.491
Soon enough.

37:29.556 --> 37:32.290
You know, I thought
God would do me a favor

37:32.355 --> 37:34.651
because I'm such a good girl.

37:34.727 --> 37:37.491
Isn't that the stupidest
thing you've ever heard?

37:37.556 --> 37:39.693
- It's not stupid--
- Shut up, Tim.

37:39.855 --> 37:42.020
What's wrong with you?

37:42.096 --> 37:45.401
Jason is in the hospital,
and you won't even go to see him.

37:45.496 --> 37:46.790
You can walk!

37:46.855 --> 37:50.503
You can walk on your two feet
to get another glass of beer

37:50.607 --> 37:53.001
if that's what
you want to do.

37:53.357 --> 37:55.452
Why don't you get it?

37:57.455 --> 37:59.792
You make me sick.

37:59.857 --> 38:02.651
Why won't you go see him?

38:02.726 --> 38:05.251
He's your best friend.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.453
He asks about you all the time.

38:08.525 --> 38:10.490
Why don't you help me?

38:10.556 --> 38:13.350
Why don't you got
and see him?

38:13.426 --> 38:15.253
Don't hit me.

38:22.725 --> 38:25.620
He's never gonna walk again.

38:25.696 --> 38:27.392
<i>* And these days *</i>

38:27.455 --> 38:30.121
<i>* They linger on *</i>

38:30.196 --> 38:33.923
<i>* Oh, yeah *</i>

38:33.996 --> 38:36.321
<i>* And every night *</i>

38:36.395 --> 38:41.792
<i>* Been waiting for *</i>

38:41.856 --> 38:44.852
<i>* A real possibility *</i>

38:44.925 --> 38:50.890
<i>* That I may meet you
in my dreams *</i>

38:50.956 --> 38:53.292
<i>* Sometimes you're there *</i>

38:53.357 --> 38:58.052
<i>* And you're talking
back to me *</i>

38:58.125 --> 39:01.822
<i>* Come the morning,
I could swear...*</i>

39:02.705 --> 39:07.003
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Where have you been?

39:07.397 --> 39:10.523
Practice.

39:19.326 --> 39:23.550
<i>* It's okay *</i>

39:23.627 --> 39:26.393
<i>* It's okay *</i>

39:54.206 --> 39:55.093
Where's Lyla?

39:55.158 --> 39:56.820
I thought she said
she was gonna be here.

39:56.897 --> 39:58.392
All right, you ready?

39:58.456 --> 40:01.452
You gotta shift
your weight back...

40:08.008 --> 40:10.000
- Hey, sorry, I'm late.
- Oh, there you are.

40:10.105 --> 40:12.192
I was just asking about you.

40:13.798 --> 40:15.192
Hey.

40:15.458 --> 40:17.952
I'm real sorry
about last night.

40:18.328 --> 40:20.651
Can we just pretend
like it didn't happen?

40:20.926 --> 40:21.592
Okay.

40:21.655 --> 40:22.951
You know I didn't
mean any of it.

40:26.608 --> 40:29.103
- I love you.
- I love you too.

40:36.728 --> 40:40.821
Oh. Thanks, Pop.

40:47.006 --> 40:48.023
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

40:48.096 --> 40:50.753
Okay, Jason, we're sure
gonna miss you around here.

40:51.025 --> 40:52.851
I'll miss you, too.

40:52.926 --> 40:54.991
Not the room, though.

40:55.257 --> 40:57.293
I'll come back and visit.

41:05.227 --> 41:06.751
Drive it up the field.
Official.

41:06.825 --> 41:09.191
<i>Downfield. Visual.</i>

41:09.257 --> 41:11.422
Good hands and feet, boys.

41:13.496 --> 41:15.221
Good reaction.

41:15.295 --> 41:17.251
Hut!

41:20.527 --> 41:21.693
Do it again, do it again.

41:21.758 --> 41:23.520
No, no, no, step back here.

41:24.808 --> 41:25.622
That a boy.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.321
Never underestimate the power
of a good spanking, Coach.

41:35.395 --> 41:36.520
Yes, sir.

41:40.256 --> 41:43.303
Looking good out there, guys.
Looking good.

42:00.956 --> 42:03.800
We got ourselves
a quarterback, Coach.

42:04.828 --> 42:08.221
Nice speech, Coach.
Did the job.

42:13.498 --> 42:14.823
Welcome aboard, son.

42:17.155 --> 42:18.522
Jack!

42:18.696 --> 42:20.393
Take care of this boy
for me, would you?

42:26.626 --> 42:28.390
Let's go!
What's everyone doing?

42:28.457 --> 42:30.423
What are you looking at?
Let's go, pick it up!

42:30.495 --> 42:31.851
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

42:31.927 --> 42:33.093
Keep your head up.

42:33.157 --> 42:35.251
<i>Let's get back in it, boys.</i>

42:35.326 --> 42:36.821
<i>Come on, now!</i>
