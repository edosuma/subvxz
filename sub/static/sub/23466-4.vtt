00:06.867 --> 00:09.700
[reporter] It's been four hours
since David Koresh and his
followers

00:09.833 --> 00:12.267
have refused
to release themselves to the FBI

00:12.400 --> 00:15.100
following a bloody shootout
with ATF.

00:15.233 --> 00:17.100
Now, details are scarce,
but the question

00:17.233 --> 00:22.933
everyone seems to be asking,
"Just when will they come out?"

00:23.067 --> 00:26.733
[news anchor]
The federal agents came
under heavy and sustained fire

00:26.867 --> 00:28.933
as they approached a ranch
owned by...

00:29.067 --> 00:31.800
They're making us
look like monsters.

00:31.933 --> 00:33.800
Calling us child abusers.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.500
Everyone's in the chapel
wondering why we're not
going out.

00:38.267 --> 00:39.800
I need you to talk to 'em.

00:39.933 --> 00:41.267
[news anchor] ...believed
to have been collected

00:41.400 --> 00:43.233
by Branch Davidian
cult members.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.000
[whirring]

00:46.000 --> 00:49.900
Negotiations failed, Noesner.
They reneged on their deal.

00:50.667 --> 00:53.133
Let me handle this.
I can have the building
cleared by lunch.

00:53.267 --> 00:55.967
Look. This isn't the first time
in the history of negotiations

00:56.100 --> 00:58.900
that someone reneged
on a deal, okay?

00:59.033 --> 01:02.200
Our primary objective has to be
getting those kids out safely.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.700
Clearing the building
comes second.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.167
They're screwing with us.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.367
Now's the time to apply
more pressure.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.833
No, no, no.
Let's not mistake getting even
for getting what we want.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.800
"Trickle-flow-gush."
That's my next strategy.

01:16.933 --> 01:20.533
If I can get a few people
to trickle out, more will follow
as it starts to flow

01:20.667 --> 01:23.767
and once Koresh
sees enough people leave,
he won't be the last in line.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.933
It would undermine
his authority. He'll lead
the rest of them out himself,

01:28.067 --> 01:30.300
and the whole thing
will be over.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.367
I just need a little time.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.133
[sighs] Okay.

01:38.167 --> 01:39.500
But...

01:40.533 --> 01:44.767
a little show of force
might help get their attention.

01:45.733 --> 01:47.200
Okay.

01:47.967 --> 01:49.067
[David] Over the years...

01:50.433 --> 01:52.633
you've looked to me
to be your leader.

01:53.967 --> 01:56.233
To guide you on this journey.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.333
But I'm no leader.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.167
I'm a follower. Just like you.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.367
God has instructed me
to stay here.

02:07.867 --> 02:10.367
And wait for His sign
before I go out there.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.833
But I can't ask you
to do the same.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.733
[helicopter whirring]

02:15.867 --> 02:20.067
And whoever wants to leave,
you're free to go.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.800
But those of thinking of going,

02:23.833 --> 02:25.767
I want you to ask yourself...

02:27.133 --> 02:30.600
why did you sacrifice
all the comforts you had

02:30.733 --> 02:32.167
to come here?

02:33.233 --> 02:35.867
Know it or not,
you came here to be tested.

02:37.433 --> 02:39.067
And this is a test.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.300
This is our withering.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.133
Our time to prove
through suffering...

02:48.900 --> 02:52.167
that we are worthy
of the miracle that's to come.

02:54.267 --> 02:55.767
[clears throat]

02:57.800 --> 03:02.267
The kingdom of heaven
is coming.

03:04.233 --> 03:07.600
And those of us
that pass this test

03:07.733 --> 03:09.833
will be the worthy.

03:11.433 --> 03:14.133
And those of us
that fail this test...

03:16.533 --> 03:19.967
well... you're gonna have
to answer to God.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.100
[panting] And I can't--

03:24.867 --> 03:26.433
-[thud]
-[man] David!

03:58.933 --> 04:01.233
[wind whistling]

04:04.433 --> 04:06.200
[sighing]

04:07.067 --> 04:08.467
You're burning up.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.833
[wincing]

04:10.967 --> 04:13.200
Uh, I'll get him some water.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.800
[panting]

04:23.867 --> 04:25.300
[panting]

04:46.833 --> 04:48.533
Which one's my dad?

05:03.367 --> 05:06.367
Hey. You probably shouldn't be
in here.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.267
You know that old myrtle tree
outside?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.067
-The one out front?
-Yeah.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.600
[Thibodeau] Mm-hmm.

05:15.133 --> 05:17.467
My dad and I planted it
when I was five.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.367
He loved that old tree.

05:24.567 --> 05:27.200
He always wanted to be buried
next to it.

05:29.933 --> 05:31.633
And now, look.

05:31.767 --> 05:35.967
Instead, he's getting buried
with buckets and shovels like...

05:36.100 --> 05:38.467
-like a piece of garbage.
-Hey.

05:39.933 --> 05:42.100
-[sobs]
-Hey.

05:47.367 --> 05:48.533
[whirring]

05:53.633 --> 05:55.467
[whirring]

06:01.133 --> 06:03.433
[faint rumbling]

06:13.067 --> 06:15.067
[whirring]

06:16.767 --> 06:17.833
[clicks]

06:17.967 --> 06:20.133
Get back. Get back.

06:21.433 --> 06:23.967
[Steve] You promised
to stay off our land.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.467
Well, David made a promise, too.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.633
He gave us his word,
after his message was played,
he'd come out.

06:29.767 --> 06:33.667
He didn't come out.
He-- he broke his promise.

06:34.933 --> 06:36.300
Could you put him on the phone?

06:36.433 --> 06:37.867
No. He doesn't want
to talk to you right now.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.533
[Gary] Look, Steve,
my bosses are frustrated.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.600
They don't understand
why you didn't come out.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.633
Look, I'm embarrassed
about that, on a
personal level.

06:45.767 --> 06:49.967
We were gonna come out, but...
God told David that we
needed to wait.

06:50.100 --> 06:53.233
-God told him?
-Yeah, just like you guys

06:53.367 --> 06:56.900
follow a higher authority,
we do too.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.100
Okay. So, what now?

07:00.233 --> 07:05.433
So, now, we wait
for a sign from God
to tell us to come out.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.533
Look...

07:12.433 --> 07:16.433
I know this all probably
sounds funny to ya.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.067
But...

07:19.133 --> 07:22.767
what if there is a higher power
than you or I, Gary?

07:23.867 --> 07:27.967
And that higher power,
He speaks to David?

07:29.233 --> 07:31.533
If there is a God
in this universe,

07:31.667 --> 07:34.500
and you've got the laws of man
and the laws of God,

07:34.633 --> 07:38.600
and that God that has led David
his entire life

07:38.733 --> 07:41.233
says to him, "Wait."

07:42.533 --> 07:44.500
I mean,
what is he supposed to do?

07:44.633 --> 07:46.267
Well, I have to be honest
with you, Steve.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.433
I don't know how my bosses
are gonna respond

07:48.567 --> 07:51.433
when I tell them we're waiting
for a sign from God.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.067
You know,
what I could really use
is a sign of good faith.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.300
If David could send
some of the people out.

07:59.433 --> 08:04.133
What, do you think
we're hostages here?
No one is a hostage here, Gary.

08:04.267 --> 08:07.667
Everyone is free
to come and go as they please.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.367
Then why isn't anyone
coming out?

08:10.500 --> 08:13.133
Because, right now,
everyone feels safer in here

08:13.267 --> 08:15.333
than they do out there with you.

08:15.467 --> 08:18.233
And because once you get
into this building,

08:18.367 --> 08:21.133
you're going to be able
to mess with the evidence
in any way that you want.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.800
And you can make up any story
that you want,

08:23.933 --> 08:25.467
but if this building stands,

08:25.600 --> 08:28.200
and the reporters and the press
get to see the evidence,

08:28.333 --> 08:32.300
then it is going to be
clearly shown what happened
here, what these men--

08:32.433 --> 08:35.200
what your men
came in here to do.

08:37.067 --> 08:39.833
-You want us to come out?
-David, listen. You've gotta--

08:39.967 --> 08:42.467
Then why are you bringing
these tanks in here?

08:42.600 --> 08:45.933
Do you know what that tells me?
[panting]

08:46.067 --> 08:47.633
That this is war.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.700
Why are you sending
all these people in here,
guns a-blazing?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.467
For war, Gary.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.333
-[helicopter whirring]
-And now, these tanks?

08:57.467 --> 08:59.367
And these guys surrounding us?

09:01.067 --> 09:06.300
You say you want us
to come out, but it sure
doesn't look like that to us.

09:07.767 --> 09:09.400
David, I--

09:14.667 --> 09:15.833
[gasps]

09:17.133 --> 09:19.300
[grunts]

09:21.267 --> 09:22.567
[sighs]

09:29.233 --> 09:30.867
"Personal level."

09:32.400 --> 09:33.867
"On a personal level."

09:34.933 --> 09:36.800
What'd we just learn
from this conversation?

09:36.933 --> 09:39.400
That they'll do whatever
this Koresh guy tells 'em.

09:39.533 --> 09:41.333
No, we already knew that.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.267
But Steve said that he
was embarrassed about that
"on a personal level."

09:45.400 --> 09:47.300
He's separating himself
from Koresh.

09:48.067 --> 09:49.733
-Saying he doesn't agree.
-Huh.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.633
What can you tell me
about this Steve Schneider?

09:52.767 --> 09:56.300
Uh, well, he was
a professor of theology
at the University of Hawaii.

09:56.433 --> 09:58.800
-Uh-huh.
-He's originally from Wisconsin.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.200
He and his wife joined the group
six years ago.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.400
He's their star recruiter.
The group has nearly doubled
since he joined.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.700
-Really?
-Our informant says

10:06.833 --> 10:09.000
that he's the glue
that keeps this place together.

10:09.133 --> 10:10.600
And get this.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.433
His wife, Judy,

10:12.567 --> 10:14.567
recently had a baby with Koresh.

10:14.700 --> 10:18.567
[whistles] That can't be good
for the relationship.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.700
Yeah.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.633
[Walter chuckles]

10:22.833 --> 10:24.600
If Steve brought
most of these people in,

10:24.733 --> 10:27.400
I would guess
he feels responsible
for their well-being.

10:27.533 --> 10:31.633
Right? Let's focus
all our attention on him.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.367
If we can break Steve away,
this whole thing ends.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.633
[Steve] David...?

10:43.433 --> 10:45.433
[voice echoes] Can you hear me?

10:46.600 --> 10:48.700
I'd like to send
some people out.

10:49.467 --> 10:51.867
Jaydean's kids
are without a mother,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.867
and Margaret and Catherine,
they're just--

10:57.000 --> 10:58.400
they're just too old for this.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.567
[Rachel]
We are running low on food.

11:01.367 --> 11:03.333
And our water supply
is real bad.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.667
The less mouths to feed,
the better.

11:10.833 --> 11:11.733
[knocking]

11:13.467 --> 11:15.733
-Well, that's getting worse.
-Yeah.

11:16.700 --> 11:17.700
Let me see.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.833
It hurts real bad.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.233
[Steve] Ooh-whee.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.200
-Hey.
-Hmm?

11:26.200 --> 11:29.800
-I'm thinking you should go.
-Well, is David going?

11:30.833 --> 11:32.500
[sighs] No.

11:34.633 --> 11:37.067
-Then I'm not going.
-Look at your finger.

11:37.167 --> 11:41.600
If that infection spreads,
you-- I mean, you could
lose your hand.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.633
-I know.
-You could lose your life.

11:43.767 --> 11:46.867
It hurts so bad, I can't sleep.

11:49.233 --> 11:50.400
Cut it off.

11:51.267 --> 11:52.267
What?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.333
I'm gonna lose it anyway, Steve.

11:53.467 --> 11:54.867
-Cut it off.
-No!

11:55.900 --> 11:58.267
Has everyone around here
lost their minds?

11:59.067 --> 12:01.867
Nobody's
cutting your finger off!
And I'm sending you outside

12:02.067 --> 12:03.633
-to get medical attention.
-No, you're not!

12:03.767 --> 12:05.667
-Yes I am--
-No, you are not!

12:11.900 --> 12:14.833
I just got off the phone.
They're sending four people out.

12:14.967 --> 12:18.067
-Two of 'em, kids.
-That's a start.

12:18.167 --> 12:20.233
Four people seems hardly cause
for celebration.

12:20.367 --> 12:23.900
Well, they're
starting to trickle out.
The strategy's working.

12:25.867 --> 12:28.300
Now, you think you can help me
coordinate bringing 'em out?

12:31.400 --> 12:32.500
Yeah, sure.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.533
[baby moans]

13:02.067 --> 13:05.400
[whining] Mama.

13:05.533 --> 13:07.533
Mama. Ma...

13:19.133 --> 13:20.567
Hey, there.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.367
I'm Gary. What's your name?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.233
-Leona.
-Leona?

13:29.367 --> 13:31.367
Such a pretty name.

13:33.333 --> 13:36.567
Hey, why don't we call your mom
and tell her you're okay?

13:39.267 --> 13:42.667
-We can't call her.
-Why not?

13:43.600 --> 13:45.533
Because you killed her.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.900
[sighs]

14:02.533 --> 14:04.833
-Hey, Steve?
-Yep?

14:06.233 --> 14:08.833
I was wondering
if you could talk to
the FBI about Perry.

14:08.967 --> 14:11.433
See if they'll let us
bury his body outside.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.700
I asked you to bury his body
in the storm shelter.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.867
-I know. It's just-- Michelle.
-Mm-hmm.

14:17.633 --> 14:20.567
I know it would mean
a lot to her if we could
bury him by the myrtle tree--

14:20.700 --> 14:22.867
It's impossible.
It's not gonna happen.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.967
Could you just ask? Please?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.233
[sighs] I can try.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.200
[Ron] All right, today,
we got something a little
different for y'all.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.600
Our guest today
is a Dr. James Tabor,
professor of-- what was it?

14:35.733 --> 14:38.067
I specialize
in emergent religions.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.867
Emergent religions.

14:40.067 --> 14:43.433
Let's talk about your interest
in this Branch Davidian cult.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.833
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Ron.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.600
I would propose that there's
no such thing as a cult.

14:49.733 --> 14:52.733
"Cult" is a judgment word used
to talk about somebody else's

14:52.867 --> 14:54.667
tightly-knit religious group.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.833
Nobody in the world belongs
to what they see as a cult.

14:57.967 --> 15:00.767
[Ron] Yeah, but there are
certain traits you think of

15:00.900 --> 15:03.500
-when you think of a cult.
-[Tabor] That's true.

15:03.633 --> 15:07.800
The early Christians,
by our definition, belonged
to a cult.

15:07.933 --> 15:10.500
[Ron] So you're saying
Jesus was a cult leader?

15:11.267 --> 15:13.100
[Tabor] I wasn't saying it
exactly like that,

15:13.233 --> 15:17.767
but by the common definition
of "cult," yes.

15:17.900 --> 15:21.767
[Ron] Oh, that got
the phones ringing.
You done it now, Dr. Tabor.

15:23.167 --> 15:27.633
Excuse me.
My son is in Mt. Carmel,
and I need to talk to him.

15:28.633 --> 15:30.500
How did you get
past the barricade?

15:30.633 --> 15:34.233
Listen, I am not
altogether sure how he got
mixed up in all this mess,

15:34.367 --> 15:36.933
but I know
if I could talk to him,
if I could just speak to him,

15:37.067 --> 15:39.200
that I could get him
to come out.

15:39.967 --> 15:41.467
I'm sorry,
I can't let you do that.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.133
-Why not?
-Because I don't wanna give him

15:43.267 --> 15:46.400
or anyone in there the chance
to tie up loose ends.

15:48.133 --> 15:50.567
You think that they're
gonna kill themselves?

15:51.367 --> 15:52.600
Doesn't matter what I think.

15:53.367 --> 15:56.067
But I'm not gonna give them
a chance to say goodbye
either way.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.900
Please escort her
back behind the checkpoint.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.067
I just wanna know
if he's all right.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.533
His name is David Thibodeau.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.433
The news reports
aren't releasing any names.

16:03.567 --> 16:06.667
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I don't have any more
information at this time.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.700
I just need to know
if he's alive! Please!

16:14.267 --> 16:16.233
[Rachel] David,
your fever's not breaking.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.467
I'm afraid you're going to die
if we don't get you help.

16:21.633 --> 16:23.067
[David murmurs]

16:24.067 --> 16:25.867
It's all part of God's plan.

16:26.067 --> 16:29.067
No. I just lost my father.
I'm not gonna lose you, too.

16:30.067 --> 16:31.767
[phone rings]

16:35.200 --> 16:37.900
-Hello?
-[Gary] Hello. Who's this?

16:39.800 --> 16:42.733
-Cyrus.
-David's son.

16:42.867 --> 16:44.733
-Yeah.
-Well, hello, Cyrus.

16:44.867 --> 16:46.900
Can you put your dad
on the phone?

16:48.733 --> 16:50.967
Are you gonna kill me?

16:51.733 --> 16:55.833
[gulps] No.
No one's going to kill you.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.833
[Steve] Cyrus?

16:58.633 --> 17:00.067
Thanks, buddy.

17:01.433 --> 17:03.067
Come here.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.267
Hello, this is Steve Schneider.

17:06.600 --> 17:09.233
Oh, hey, Steve.
Just wanted to give you
a quick call

17:09.367 --> 17:11.733
and let you know
that everybody arrived safe.

17:11.867 --> 17:15.267
Good. Well,
I hope that shows you
what we're about.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.067
We wanna see this
resolved peacefully.

17:18.133 --> 17:22.067
Of course.
I can tell you're the voice
of reason in there.

17:22.133 --> 17:25.567
I bet people count on you
to make sure they're
taken care of.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.700
[Steve]
I'm not sure that's true.

17:27.833 --> 17:31.400
Well, from what I hear,
you're the reason the group's
grown like it has.

17:31.533 --> 17:34.900
The reason that
the group has grown is
because of David's teaching,

17:35.067 --> 17:36.533
not because
of anything I'm doing.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.067
I think you're being modest.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.533
Knowing everything
you know now...

17:42.300 --> 17:45.467
are you happy you brought
all those people in there?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.233
I'm not sure
what you're driving at, Gary.

17:48.367 --> 17:52.733
Well, do you think
David has everyone's
best interest in mind?

17:57.633 --> 17:59.767
Yeah. I do.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.233
Because, forgive me
for saying this,

18:02.367 --> 18:05.500
but I can't help but notice
a trend that when God
comes to talk

18:05.633 --> 18:07.667
to modern-day prophets,

18:08.433 --> 18:10.633
it seems one thing
He always tells them to do

18:10.767 --> 18:13.367
is have sex
with lots of young women.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.333
Well, that's
a pretty cynical view
of what we're doing here.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.967
I'm not sure I appreciate
your tone with that one.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.333
-Then explain it to me.
-I'm not stupid.

18:23.467 --> 18:27.167
I know you're trying to create
dissent between me and David.

18:27.933 --> 18:30.133
You're right, I am.
'Cause you know what I think?

18:31.067 --> 18:33.300
I think David's dying,

18:33.433 --> 18:35.633
and I think he doesn't mind
bringing all of you with him.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.700
You know, Gary,
where you've got this all wrong,

18:37.833 --> 18:39.600
the thing that you're missing...

18:39.733 --> 18:41.300
is this is real.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.900
I do believe that David
is the Lamb of God.

18:44.067 --> 18:46.067
Not because of any trick
he's pulled,

18:46.200 --> 18:50.067
but because of what I have seen
with my own two eyes.

18:50.167 --> 18:55.367
But he's lost his way, Steve.
I think you can see it.

18:56.533 --> 19:01.467
For years,
David has been prophesying
exactly what is happening here.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.567
From the way
you came in, to the tanks,
the soldiers, everything.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.500
I can't figure out
another explanation
that makes any sense.

19:08.267 --> 19:11.800
For a minor weapons violation?
All this?

19:11.933 --> 19:13.900
You think
he's lost his way?

19:14.067 --> 19:18.233
Everything David has prophesied
has come true.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.700
[sighs]

19:32.300 --> 19:34.600
Hey, guys,
stay away from the window.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.633
-It's not safe.
-[helicopter whirring]

19:42.633 --> 19:44.533
[Cyrus]
Why are they doing that?

19:44.667 --> 19:46.167
I don't know.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.200
Come on. Let's go.

19:49.233 --> 19:52.133
-[helicopter whirring]
-[Walter] What's going on?

19:54.667 --> 19:56.200
[sighs]

19:56.333 --> 19:58.433
What goes through
people's heads, you know?

19:58.567 --> 20:01.767
I mean, these HRT guys,
what makes grown men
act like that?

20:01.900 --> 20:04.767
They're mooning kids,
for God's sake.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.633
They're just built that way.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.767
The sad thing is, the Davidians
can't tell us apart from them.

20:15.133 --> 20:17.133
I need you to get me
a video camera.

20:18.867 --> 20:20.900
Ready?
How's my hair?

20:21.033 --> 20:22.633
It's about as good
as it's gonna get.

20:22.767 --> 20:24.567
-Knock it off.
-[laughs]

20:24.700 --> 20:26.233
All right. We're good.

20:27.633 --> 20:30.733
Hello. I'm Gary Noesner.

20:31.567 --> 20:33.267
The notorious.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.800
And...

20:35.933 --> 20:37.367
this is my family.

20:38.867 --> 20:40.533
Yeah, that's my wife,
Carol, there,

20:40.667 --> 20:45.633
and my kids, Kelly, Katy,
and Rusty, and I love 'em.

20:45.767 --> 20:48.300
I'm sure you love your kids
the same way.

20:48.433 --> 20:52.033
And there is literally
nothing I wouldn't do to keep
my children safe.

20:53.533 --> 20:55.600
I'm sure we share that feeling.

20:57.733 --> 21:00.133
Now, any way you look at it,
this is a bad situation,

21:00.267 --> 21:05.067
but I wanna make sure
that your kids remain
safe through it all.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.067
So, please...

21:08.967 --> 21:10.833
please work with me.

21:11.633 --> 21:12.800
Help me keep your kids safe.

21:12.933 --> 21:15.133
[whirring]

21:16.767 --> 21:18.333
[baby crying]

21:19.333 --> 21:20.433
[whispers] Rachel?

21:22.467 --> 21:24.133
[baby crying]

21:24.933 --> 21:27.300
Hey, I got a weird question.

21:27.433 --> 21:28.733
Y'know, I...

21:30.700 --> 21:34.067
Uh... I'm not producing
any milk.

21:35.367 --> 21:39.067
And... I was wondering
if you had some to spare
for Mayanah.

21:39.167 --> 21:42.900
I'm having the same problem.
All the mothers are.

21:43.700 --> 21:47.133
-You are?
-Yeah. Sorry.

21:47.267 --> 21:50.633
-Oh, God.
-[Rachel sniffles]

21:50.767 --> 21:52.767
All right.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.067
-[baby crying]
-Shh, shh, shh...

21:58.733 --> 22:00.667
[groans]

22:00.800 --> 22:02.967
This universe is mine.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.267
[Walter]
I can't believe
Koresh likes this.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.067
I am God here!

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
-Jesus.
-[chuckles]

22:09.867 --> 22:11.933
-I don't get this movie.
-Mm.

22:12.067 --> 22:14.333
I can't say it makes
my top 10 list either.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.933
[man on video] You're wrong.
You need to be led--

22:17.067 --> 22:18.100
-[phone ringing]
-Ready?

22:18.233 --> 22:20.167
-Yeah.
-[monitor beeps]

22:20.933 --> 22:23.100
-Hello?
-Hey, Gary, it's Steve.

22:23.233 --> 22:27.067
Um, we just wanted to say
thanks for sending
the videotape.

22:27.167 --> 22:28.633
We understand
what you're trying to do,

22:28.767 --> 22:31.267
and we really appreciate
you making that effort.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.900
I just wanted you to know
that there's some people
out here

22:34.067 --> 22:36.133
who care about what happens
to you, that's all.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.067
Yeah. Um...

22:38.200 --> 22:41.233
I do have one small problem,

22:41.367 --> 22:44.067
and I could really use
your help.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.233
-What kinda problem?
-[sighs] So...

22:46.367 --> 22:48.400
I guess because of the stress
of all this,

22:49.400 --> 22:54.300
the mothers
who are nursing have...
have stopped lactating.

22:54.433 --> 22:57.867
So... we need milk.

22:58.067 --> 23:00.833
For the babies.
Could you send some in?

23:01.600 --> 23:05.067
-Let me talk to my bosses.
-Okay. Thanks, Gary.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.500
You bet.

23:09.733 --> 23:13.433
No, I'm not throwing them
a picnic on national TV.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.867
They want milk,
they can come out and get it.

23:16.067 --> 23:20.467
Look. Usually the people
I negotiate with are backed
into a corner.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.933
They need something.
And that's what gives me
leverage.

23:24.067 --> 23:27.600
But these people,
they just want us to go away.

23:27.733 --> 23:30.433
The only way I've been
able to motivate them
is with goodwill.

23:30.567 --> 23:34.233
But now, their babies need milk,
and we can give it to them.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.333
This is something
we can build on.
We can use this.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.800
So, Steve,
I talked to my bosses,

23:42.933 --> 23:44.433
and they're gonna give you
the milk.

23:44.567 --> 23:46.367
Aw, Gary.
[sighs]

23:46.500 --> 23:48.900
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

23:49.800 --> 23:53.333
But there's one condition.
You're gonna have to send
some kids out.

23:56.067 --> 24:00.233
Wait. Um...
let me just make sure
I'm hearing you correctly.

24:01.067 --> 24:03.433
Um, you want us to trade...

24:04.733 --> 24:05.900
our kids for the milk?

24:06.667 --> 24:08.833
I wouldn't
really put it like that.
I'm just saying that--

24:08.967 --> 24:11.533
Look, I don't wanna
point out the obvious,
but if we send out our kids,

24:11.667 --> 24:13.167
then we won't need
the milk, will we?

24:13.300 --> 24:14.200
Steve?

24:14.333 --> 24:16.867
-Yeah?
-May I?

24:17.900 --> 24:20.333
Um, yeah.
David wants to talk to you.

24:21.100 --> 24:22.900
Yeah, how much milk
we talking here, Gary?

24:23.067 --> 24:24.633
-David--
-Two quarts per kid? Three?

24:24.767 --> 24:27.667
I mean, some kids
gotta be worth more than others.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.400
Cyrus, my son, he's eight,
but he can fix any car engine
you put in front of him.

24:32.533 --> 24:36.233
That's gotta be worth,
what, at least three quarts
and a milkshake?

24:37.067 --> 24:38.167
You people.

24:38.933 --> 24:40.567
[handset clicks]

24:41.533 --> 24:42.567
[sighs]

24:42.700 --> 24:44.700
You shouldn't have done that.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.333
You know we have to work
with them.

24:47.467 --> 24:48.333
Yeah, well...

24:48.467 --> 24:50.867
good luck with that, Steve.

25:08.567 --> 25:12.267
Rachel? This is how
I'd like to ration out
the food and water.

25:13.067 --> 25:14.267
Can you take care of that?

25:14.400 --> 25:16.300
No one's gonna be happy
with this.

25:16.433 --> 25:19.100
Well, if they don't like it,
they're welcome to leave.

25:20.767 --> 25:23.967
Steve. Steve,
did you get any news
about the milk?

25:24.100 --> 25:28.500
Yeah. I'm-- I'm--
I'm working on it. I promise.

25:28.633 --> 25:30.433
Hey, Steve,
have you had a chance
to talk to the FBI about Perry?

25:30.567 --> 25:34.267
Look, Thibs, just bury the body
like I asked you. Okay?

25:40.133 --> 25:42.067
-[Gary] You get bacon on yours?
-[Walter] Yeah.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.933
Oh. I shoulda gotten bacon
on mine.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.867
You know, that's how we stopped
the Clarksville prison riot.

25:51.067 --> 25:52.833
-With bacon?
-Oh, yeah.

25:53.900 --> 25:57.067
It was after day eight,
and we took a bunch of bacon

25:57.200 --> 25:59.367
and threw it on some coals.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.467
The prisoners smelled it
and were instantly overcome
with hunger.

26:02.600 --> 26:05.767
And I told them,
if they came out, they could eat
as much as them want.

26:07.100 --> 26:10.467
Never underestimate
what a hungry man will do
for bacon.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.333
Shame the Davidians
don't eat pork.

26:12.467 --> 26:14.067
-It is.
-[chuckles]

26:16.267 --> 26:18.267
[man on radio]
We've got movement
outside the compound.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.200
- All agents to their posts.
-Shit.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.067
Prepare to fire on command.

26:22.967 --> 26:24.533
[phone rings]

26:25.300 --> 26:27.233
-It's Steve.
-Steve! What's going on?

26:27.367 --> 26:29.533
Tactical says
someone exited the compound.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.433
Shit!

26:37.833 --> 26:39.733
It's Thibodeau. He's unarmed!

26:39.867 --> 26:42.567
He's just trying to bury a body.
Please don't shoot him!

26:42.700 --> 26:43.800
Okay, hang on, Steve.

26:43.933 --> 26:45.767
-Where's Decker?
-I don't know.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.467
[dispatcher] Copy sniper one,
sniper one, you got the loop.

26:55.433 --> 26:58.233
-[Wayne] Steve!
-Get out of my way!

26:59.467 --> 27:01.733
Thibs!
You gotta get back in here!

27:09.367 --> 27:10.867
Tell your man to stand down!

27:11.067 --> 27:13.333
This is a tactical decision.
It's not your call, Gary.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.367
No, no. He's just trying
to bury a body.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.200
And I'm telling you,
you don't know what
he's burying.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.667
That could be a bomb,
for all we know.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.433
Damn it, I'm telling you,
the kid's unarmed.

27:20.567 --> 27:22.067
And I'm telling you,
you don't know that, Gary.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.500
Now, I can't have people
strolling outside,

27:24.633 --> 27:26.833
walking around, looking
at our positions on things.

27:26.967 --> 27:29.133
The kid is trying to bury
one of his dead, Mitch.

27:29.267 --> 27:33.300
They let the ATF
take their wounded away.
Show 'em the same respect.

27:33.433 --> 27:36.900
They lost my respect
when they started killing
federal agents, Gary.

27:37.067 --> 27:39.333
All right, all right.
You want another Ruby Ridge
on your hands?

27:39.467 --> 27:41.167
-Yeah.
-Go ahead, shoot that boy.

27:41.300 --> 27:42.833
But just remember,
the ATF's not gonna be around

27:42.967 --> 27:45.200
-to take the blame this time!
-I don't give a shit!

27:48.600 --> 27:51.733
Requesting permission
to take the shot. Over.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.400
[sniper]
I have the target in my view.

27:55.533 --> 27:57.500
[mutters]

27:59.067 --> 28:03.467
Repeat, requesting permission
to take the shot. Over.

28:09.267 --> 28:10.600
Stand down.

28:34.833 --> 28:36.300
Thank you.
Good morning, everyone.

28:37.067 --> 28:41.800
A few days ago, the FBI learned
that the Branch Davidians
ran out of milk.

28:42.567 --> 28:44.467
And they are no longer able
to feed their children.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.267
Nice of them
to tell the truth for once.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.133
Numerous attempts have been
made by the FBI

28:48.267 --> 28:50.500
to deliver milk
for their babies,

28:50.633 --> 28:52.100
but they have all been refused.

28:52.933 --> 28:57.300
It seems they are
using their own children
as pawns in this thing.

28:58.100 --> 29:00.267
David Koresh...

29:01.067 --> 29:03.267
let us bring milk
to those children.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.600
Pawns, Gary?
We're using our kids as pawns?

29:06.733 --> 29:09.067
-Is that what you think?
-No, it's not.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.900
Then why are they
saying that on TV?

29:11.667 --> 29:13.467
-I don't know.
-Your boss said

29:13.600 --> 29:15.633
they have made attempts
to deliver milk.

29:15.767 --> 29:18.233
Now, when did that happen?
Because we've been here
the entire time,

29:18.367 --> 29:20.533
and I don't recall anyone
knocking on our door!

29:21.533 --> 29:24.700
Steve, look.
I wanna get you that milk.
That's the God's honest truth.

29:24.833 --> 29:27.467
But you're gonna have to let out
some of the kids in return.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.900
I'm sorry, Gary.
That's not gonna happen.

29:30.067 --> 29:32.333
-[line clicks]
-[sighs]

29:35.067 --> 29:36.467
[sighs]

29:36.600 --> 29:38.900
[reporter]
With cult leader David Koresh

29:39.067 --> 29:41.067
becoming less involved
in direct negotiations,

29:41.167 --> 29:44.533
authorities suspect
his wounds may be getting worse.

29:44.667 --> 29:48.767
Agents told cult members
that those not charged
with serious offenses

29:48.900 --> 29:51.533
eventually will be allowed
to return to the compound

29:51.667 --> 29:54.067
once it's cleared
of the crime scene.

29:54.133 --> 29:57.167
-Sheriff Harwell?
-Yeah?

29:57.300 --> 30:00.167
I'm Gary Noesner,
Head Negotiator, FBI.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.433
Mm. Can I help you?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.733
-You mind?
-[murmurs]

30:09.067 --> 30:10.467
Well...

30:11.233 --> 30:15.667
when I can't get a guy
to trust me, I try and find
someone he will trust.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.167
And David Koresh trusts you.

30:19.933 --> 30:20.833
Mm.

30:23.067 --> 30:24.533
I could really use your help.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.100
[phone ringing]

30:30.233 --> 30:31.567
[grunts]

30:32.433 --> 30:34.267
[ringing continues]

30:37.567 --> 30:41.867
-[groans] This is David.
-David, it's Sheriff Harwell.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.567
[sighs]

30:44.333 --> 30:45.633
Hey, Jack.

30:46.867 --> 30:49.200
Sure is nice
to hear a friendly voice.

30:49.333 --> 30:52.633
David, I came down here today

30:52.767 --> 30:55.367
because I wanna make sure
that those babies get the
milk they need.

30:56.133 --> 31:00.300
Well, they said on the news
it was us refusing to make
this happen, Jack.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.667
It's just--

31:04.233 --> 31:07.067
these are our children
they're asking us to give up.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.700
I understand, but...

31:08.833 --> 31:12.133
it might not be the worst thing
to get the babies fed,

31:12.267 --> 31:16.067
and at the same time,
get some of your other kids
out of harm's way.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.933
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, I do.

31:20.067 --> 31:23.967
Good. Now, David, how much milk
do you think you need?

31:26.067 --> 31:28.700
-Six gallons will do.
-All right.

31:29.467 --> 31:31.500
Now, David, I'm gonna get ya
the six gallons,

31:31.633 --> 31:35.067
but you gotta keep
a level head in this while
we try to resolve this thing.

31:35.767 --> 31:38.633
Thank you, Jack.
You're a good man.

31:40.267 --> 31:43.233
Look, I just don't think
we should make it
so easy on 'em.

31:43.367 --> 31:45.300
Jesus. You think
we made it easy on 'em?

31:45.433 --> 31:48.067
They agreed
to send their kids out,
for Christ's sake.

31:48.167 --> 31:51.100
Right now, the only card
we have to play is
creating goodwill.

31:51.233 --> 31:54.800
No, it's not.
That's your only card, Gary.

31:54.933 --> 31:56.233
[sighs]

31:57.067 --> 31:59.333
[Gary] Look, the people
they're sending out won't talk.

31:59.467 --> 32:01.967
And we have no idea
what's going on in there--

32:02.100 --> 32:03.400
what they're planning to do.

32:03.533 --> 32:05.367
All right.
What's your point, Noesner?

32:05.500 --> 32:08.633
If we send the milk in
and bug it somehow...

32:08.767 --> 32:10.500
we'll have ears inside.

32:11.967 --> 32:16.533
That'll help me
with negotiations,
and Mitch, tactically.

32:27.067 --> 32:27.900
Do it.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.367
-Judy, you need--
-Shh.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.100
[whispers]
Just got her to sleep.

32:53.233 --> 32:54.533
What's going on?

32:55.467 --> 32:57.233
-Are there more people going?
-Yeah.

32:58.067 --> 32:59.733
And I want you and Mayanah
to be two of 'em.

32:59.867 --> 33:01.967
No. I already told you, Steve.
I can't go--

33:02.100 --> 33:04.433
Well, this is
not about you anymore.
This is about Mayanah.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.167
You asked me to look out for her
like she was my own.

33:08.300 --> 33:11.267
Well, that's what I'm doing.
This is what that looks like.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.067
I don't trust the people
out there, though, Steve.

33:13.167 --> 33:14.667
I don't trust them.

33:17.067 --> 33:17.967
I know.

33:18.933 --> 33:22.567
What about you?
I can't leave you.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.567
I should stay.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.733
-It's the right thing to do.
-[Judy sighs]

33:34.567 --> 33:38.067
Hey, Luke. I'm gonna miss
that inquisitive mind.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.767
I want you
to take care of your mama.
All right, give me a hug.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.600
[David] Okay.

33:56.967 --> 33:58.133
All right.

33:59.133 --> 34:01.900
What are Judy and Mayanah
doing in the hallway?

34:02.067 --> 34:03.433
'Cause they're leaving.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.467
Six gallons.
Bugs are in the crate.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.500
Need a vest?

34:10.700 --> 34:12.667
They don't wanna shoot me.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.800
All right.

34:19.633 --> 34:21.600
[David grunts] Is that everyone?

34:25.433 --> 34:28.767
Um, Dave,
I'd like you to send out...

34:29.533 --> 34:31.333
Judy and Mayanah.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.433
No.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.600
I can't do that.

34:39.067 --> 34:40.633
[faintly] Okay.

34:43.567 --> 34:45.900
You know, I've never asked you
for anything.

34:48.667 --> 34:52.667
In all the years
I've known you, everything
I have done has been for you.

34:54.067 --> 34:58.500
Please, David.
I'm asking you this one thing.

35:00.067 --> 35:01.900
And I'll talk to Judy.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.833
She can just tell them that--
that Mayanah is my daughter.

35:09.567 --> 35:11.133
But, Steve...

35:12.233 --> 35:14.767
she's not your daughter.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.633
She's mine.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.800
Right.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.767
[faintly] Right.

35:31.567 --> 35:32.767
I wanna stay with you.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.800
Oh, I wanna stay
with you, too, baby.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.800
-But God wants me to stay here.
-[child] Mommy...?

35:36.933 --> 35:40.700
And I need
to keep you safe, okay?

35:49.767 --> 35:52.067
You're the greatest gift
God ever gave me.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.200
[Steve] Let's go.

36:25.733 --> 36:28.900
Hey, guys. Right up here.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.500
-You got it? Come here.
-[child whimpers]

36:31.633 --> 36:35.633
Come here, buddy.
Come here. Come here.
Let's go. Come on with me.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.867
How many guns you think
they're pointing at us
right now?

36:39.667 --> 36:42.467
-I bet a lot.
-[Wayne chuckles]

36:59.600 --> 37:04.300
-Steve, hi. Wayne, Gary Noesner.
-Hey.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.533
-[Gary] Hi.
-Yeah, I've seen your video.

37:08.567 --> 37:10.933
But I'm sure
I'm much better-looking
in person, right?

37:11.067 --> 37:14.300
Let's just say that you got
a pretty good face for radio.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.400
[chuckling]

37:16.533 --> 37:17.433
Could we just
get this over with?

37:17.567 --> 37:19.200
Yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.600
Steve, can I talk
to you for a minute,
just you and I?

37:22.433 --> 37:24.267
Yeah. It's okay.

37:30.167 --> 37:33.267
You need to know
your people are in a lot
more danger than you think.

37:35.867 --> 37:38.467
And in my experience, the longer
these situations go on,

37:38.600 --> 37:40.833
the more erratic
people's behavior gets.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.567
Yeah, we're seeing that
on our side, too.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.233
Uh-huh.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.867
-Can I ask you something, Steve?
-Yeah.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.567
Whose child is Mayanah?

37:56.167 --> 37:58.267
We've all made
a lot of sacrifices to be here.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.400
-She's David's child, isn't she?
-I made a choice.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.200
Judy made a choice.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.300
How is she, Judy?
I heard she was shot.

38:10.833 --> 38:12.567
-She's fine.
-She's fine?

38:12.700 --> 38:15.567
She has a bullet in her,
and her baby needs milk,
but she's fine?

38:15.700 --> 38:18.267
She's still in there.
Why is that?

38:19.233 --> 38:20.667
Because we made
a decision together--

38:20.800 --> 38:22.867
No.
No, I think

38:23.067 --> 38:24.933
David was the one
who made that decision, not you.

38:25.067 --> 38:27.067
I think if it were up to you,

38:27.133 --> 38:30.167
Judy would be
in that vehicle right now,
with Mayanah.

38:32.600 --> 38:33.867
Am I wrong?

38:36.500 --> 38:38.333
Now, look, Steve,
the thing you gotta realize

38:38.467 --> 38:41.800
is that you do have the power
to make your own decisions.

38:42.767 --> 38:46.867
Decisions for you,
for Judy, for Mayanah,
for everyone in there

38:47.067 --> 38:50.600
who is waiting
for someone to find
the courage to lead them out.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.400
You know, it's funny...
I can't tell you

38:56.533 --> 38:58.567
how many times
I wanted to leave this place.

38:59.333 --> 39:03.133
And all the fire ants
and the dust storms...

39:04.200 --> 39:06.067
and David.

39:06.833 --> 39:09.967
Oh, you're right.
David's horrible.

39:10.967 --> 39:13.167
Self-centered, rude.

39:14.133 --> 39:18.233
I wish that God
would have chosen

39:18.367 --> 39:23.633
any other person on the earth
to speak through instead of him.

39:24.867 --> 39:26.533
But you know what?

39:27.300 --> 39:28.900
Despite everything
you're saying,

39:29.667 --> 39:33.167
no one's explained to me
what we did to deserve all this.

39:35.367 --> 39:38.300
You know, you have the power
to end this, too.

39:39.267 --> 39:40.933
How's that?

39:43.067 --> 39:44.800
You could just leave.

39:48.533 --> 39:50.300
We weren't bothering anybody.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.067
Yeah, I know.

40:04.067 --> 40:05.633
Thanks for the milk.

40:17.433 --> 40:18.733
[camera whirring]

40:19.633 --> 40:22.100
All right. We're rolling.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.533
[David] Okay.

40:26.167 --> 40:28.533
Say whatever you wanna say.

40:31.133 --> 40:32.633
Well...

40:35.400 --> 40:38.867
I just wanna say
thanks a lot for killing my dad.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.967
My dad's name was Perry Jones.

40:44.033 --> 40:46.033
[Rachel] He was an unarmed man.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.700
And...

40:50.867 --> 40:53.700
you just shot him
through the door, so...

40:56.200 --> 40:57.233
thanks a lot.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.333
-And thanks for the milk.
-Yeah, thanks for the milk.

41:13.533 --> 41:16.100
-[sniffles]
-[David sighs]

41:18.333 --> 41:19.700
[grunts]

41:23.400 --> 41:24.900
Wow.

41:25.667 --> 41:27.133
Is it bleeding again?

41:27.267 --> 41:30.600
-It's all over the pillow.
-[David sighs] Well...

41:30.733 --> 41:33.667
it ain't nothing
for a tough guy like me.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.067
[chuckles]

41:36.833 --> 41:40.867
A lot of beliefs
people have may seem abnormal
or strange to other people,

41:41.067 --> 41:43.367
but that doesn't mean
it's not right, though.

41:44.367 --> 41:48.400
God speaks to me.
I have a message to present.

41:49.167 --> 41:50.900
And you may not believe that.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.100
If you don't believe that,
then believe this,

41:54.233 --> 41:56.933
irrespective of God
speaking to me.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.100
See this here?

42:03.067 --> 42:07.333
This is my family.
May not be like your family.

42:08.167 --> 42:10.200
But you come pointing guns

42:10.333 --> 42:13.733
in the direction
of my wives and my kids?

42:14.500 --> 42:19.733
Damn it, I will meet you
at the door any time.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.900
I'm sorry
some of you guys got shot.

42:25.967 --> 42:27.700
But, hey...

42:29.967 --> 42:32.867
God'll have to sort that out,
won't He?

42:34.533 --> 42:35.833
[clicks]

42:38.100 --> 42:40.200
You still think
you can reason with this guy?

42:51.600 --> 42:53.100
What are you gonna do with that?

42:56.400 --> 43:00.267
Can't let this get out.
Makes him look too normal.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.200
[sighs]

43:06.333 --> 43:08.433
-[voices overlapping]
-[car horns honking]

43:10.533 --> 43:11.767
[sighs]

43:12.533 --> 43:14.467
[siren whoops]

43:15.667 --> 43:17.767
[voices yelling]

43:24.067 --> 43:26.067
Your boy's alive.

43:28.733 --> 43:31.933
Thank you. Thank you.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.933
Okay.

43:44.467 --> 43:50.567
-I wanted to thank you, Steve.
-For what?

43:51.333 --> 43:53.933
Taking care of everyone
when I was down.

43:55.733 --> 43:57.233
And for not leaving.

43:58.100 --> 44:00.833
I know you've been having
your doubts.

44:01.600 --> 44:02.900
I understand.

44:03.933 --> 44:08.100
Heck... I've had my own, too.

44:18.167 --> 44:20.967
-You need something?
-Yeah.

44:22.700 --> 44:25.167
-Glass of milk would be nice.
-[laughing]

44:27.533 --> 44:31.433
-No, that's for the kids, David.
-I know it is,

44:31.567 --> 44:34.133
but I just escaped death
by the grace of God,

44:34.267 --> 44:37.667
and to be honest with you,
milk would do us good.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.167
No one'll know, Steve.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.833
[Steve] Glass of milk,
I have to admit,

44:40.967 --> 44:42.167
would be pretty good
right about now.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.367
[David] That's a yes.

44:45.133 --> 44:47.433
Gonna be the best glass of milk
we've ever had.

44:55.667 --> 45:00.333
They don't give
a shit about those kids.
When are you gonna see it?

45:01.300 --> 45:02.767
I see it.

45:02.900 --> 45:05.633
The only thing people like this
respond to is pressure.

45:05.767 --> 45:08.467
Does it feel like they have
any pressure on them to you?

45:09.233 --> 45:12.767
-They sure don't.
-We been here, what, eight days?

45:12.900 --> 45:16.200
The only thing
we have to show for it
is, what, 19 people?

45:17.233 --> 45:19.567
We keep up at this rate,
we'll be here till Christmas.

45:20.533 --> 45:22.067
[sighs]

45:22.133 --> 45:23.833
You been letting Gary
do his thing.

45:24.600 --> 45:27.100
How 'bout you let me do
a little of mine?

45:29.167 --> 45:33.100
[Ron] And Bubba might say,
"But ain't they messin' with
young girls in there?"

45:33.233 --> 45:35.233
And I got this to say to Bubba.

45:36.533 --> 45:40.500
The ATF has no jurisdiction
in matters of young girls.

45:40.633 --> 45:44.567
Or sex, or polygamy,
or anything else they're
talking about.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.933
It's none of their
damn business.

45:47.067 --> 45:48.633
Their business...

45:48.767 --> 45:53.200
is alcohol, tobacco,
and firearms. Period.

45:54.367 --> 45:58.367
And yes, David Koresh did marry
his wife when she was 14.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.333
And you might have feelings
about that,

46:00.467 --> 46:02.367
just like I have feelings
about that myself.

46:02.500 --> 46:05.433
I have a daughter.
I find the idea reprehensible.

46:05.567 --> 46:08.067
[Ron]
But according to Texas law,

46:08.133 --> 46:12.900
it is legal
to marry a 14-year-old
if her parents give consent.

46:13.667 --> 46:16.500
Which, again,
I am not saying is right.

46:17.267 --> 46:19.133
But I am saying,
if you have a problem with it,

46:19.267 --> 46:22.100
your problem is actually
with Texas law.

46:23.067 --> 46:24.067
Not David Koresh.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.633
[engine stops]

46:26.400 --> 46:28.733
[reporter]
The Branch Davidians have hung
a sheet outside the window

46:28.867 --> 46:30.367
saying they want the press.

46:30.500 --> 46:33.133
Reporters have their own take
on the sign.

46:33.267 --> 46:35.767
[all]
God help us, we are the press!

46:35.900 --> 46:38.667
[reporter 2] ...siege
against the Branch Davidians
in Waco, Texas.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.933
And raise similar questions
about the--

46:41.067 --> 46:43.833
I just don't understand
why they won't let us
talk to them.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.633
[reporter] Ma'am,
if your son were here right--

46:45.767 --> 46:47.200
No, no. Go back.

46:47.333 --> 46:49.233
[man] ...web surrounded
this house...

46:49.367 --> 46:50.900
[reporter] What would you want
to tell him?

46:51.067 --> 46:52.600
If you want to look
in the camera and speak to him,

46:52.733 --> 46:53.667
what would you
want to say to him?

46:53.800 --> 46:54.967
Do you know her?

46:55.733 --> 46:57.433
That's my mom.

46:57.567 --> 47:00.067
Dave, honey...

47:01.400 --> 47:05.367
I know the last time
you were home, I didn't
listen very well.

47:06.133 --> 47:09.633
I-- I got my issues
with the Bible and stuff.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.867
And I know that you got
a group in there

47:13.067 --> 47:16.100
that you really care about,
and they're like family.

47:17.967 --> 47:21.500
But I'm your family.
And you're the only family
I've got.

47:21.633 --> 47:25.800
[sniffles] And if anything ever
happened to you, I don't know
what I'd do.

47:25.933 --> 47:27.200
[sobs]

47:27.333 --> 47:29.300
Thank you.

47:29.433 --> 47:31.900
Dave, please? Come out.

47:32.067 --> 47:36.067
And I promise I'm gonna be
a better listener, okay?

47:37.533 --> 47:40.067
I promise
I'm gonna be a better mother.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.400
So, please, just come on out.

47:45.633 --> 47:47.933
[Balenda sniffles, sobs]
Thank you. Thank you so much.

47:48.067 --> 47:49.100
[pops]

47:49.900 --> 47:53.067
-[David] Everyone stay calm.
-[Rachel] What happened?
