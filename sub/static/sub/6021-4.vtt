WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:08.766
-You sure you can't stay longer?
-No, we just came up for the funeral.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.035
Poor Marvin Kessler.
He went too early.

00:11.211 --> 00:13.679
He was 96 years old.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.839
That had nothing to do with it.
The man was out of shape.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.883
That's why we joined a program.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.249
We walk once around the block
three times a week.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.687
And every morning I eat a plum.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.259
Well, whatever you're doing,
you're wearing me out.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.452
What about you?

00:29.629 --> 00:32.894
Yeah, looks like you're getting
a little spare tire there, tiger.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.466
-Really?
-Hey, Seinfelds.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.694
-Hey, Mr. Kramer.
-How long you staying?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.395
We just came to town for funeral.

00:39.572 --> 00:42.473
Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard.
Yeah, Marvin Kessler.

00:42.642 --> 00:44.803
Boy, that makes you think.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.140
If he could go.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.280
See you downstairs at the car.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.711
Sure you don't need a hand?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.045
No, no.
The luggage is on the program.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.413
I got a brick in here.

01:00.827 --> 01:03.728
-Did you give blood?
-No, no, not giving. Hoarding.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.832
I'm storing it at the blood bank,
just in case.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.024
In case of what?

01:08.201 --> 01:10.499
Jerry, I know myself.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.968
If I'm out on the street
and it starts to go down...

01:13.139 --> 01:15.733
...I don't back off until it's finished.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.973
-Are we finished?
-Done.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.013
-Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.
-Yeah.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.347
-You haven't seen Jimmy for years.
-I know.

01:28.521 --> 01:31.354
Well, I'm glad I got to see him
before he hit puberty and got...

01:31.524 --> 01:35.290
...you know, all lurchy and awkward.

01:35.462 --> 01:38.761
Actually, I'm gonna need someone
to look after him tomorrow evening.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.992
-Tomorrow evening? Sure.
-Do you know anyone responsible?

01:44.971 --> 01:46.336
Do I know anyone?

01:47.073 --> 01:48.870
If you think of anybody,
give me a call.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.434
What are you doing?

01:53.613 --> 01:56.241
Oh, incense. For the mood.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.884
Oh, yes, by all means. The mood.

01:59.486 --> 02:03.855
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to lend support for the mood.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.318
-Cream soda?
-Vanilla.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.639 --> 02:20.799
Can you believe that?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.635
Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.471
Who wants to be responsible?
Whenever anything goes wrong...

02:25.645 --> 02:28.512
...the first thing they ask is,
"Who's responsible for this?"

02:28.681 --> 02:30.410
I couldn't raise a kid?

02:30.583 --> 02:32.983
Come on,
I love bossing people around.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.586
-I thought you're with Tara tonight.
-I was. I had to leave.

02:39.759 --> 02:42.751
She lit this vanilla incense.
The smell drove me nuts.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.295
All I could think about was food.
I had to get out.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.400
Gonna need some pudding here.
Pudding.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.866
You just left? What did you tell her?

02:51.037 --> 02:54.564
Told her I had a bus transfer
that was only good for another hour.

02:56.509 --> 02:59.239
-What?
-I don't know. I was starving, Jerry.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.175
Oh, pudding.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.712
You want some?

03:02.882 --> 03:06.283
Hey, you guys think
I'm getting a little chunky?

03:06.452 --> 03:09.353
What? Are you kidding?
We look great.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.546
You know what this pudding needs?

03:11.724 --> 03:14.921
The skin on the top, like when your
mother used to make it on the stove.

03:15.094 --> 03:16.083
What do you think?

03:16.262 --> 03:19.390
I think you're getting a little pudding
under the skin yourself.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.564
My service rates went up?

03:24.737 --> 03:26.329
You banks are all the same...

03:26.506 --> 03:29.771
...with your hidden fees
and your service charges.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.104
Maybe I'll just take my blood
elsewhere, yeah.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.212
We could transfer it
to another bank for you.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.213
Oh, no, no. No more banks.
I'm keeping my blood in my freezer...

03:37.383 --> 03:39.715
...with my money!

03:43.590 --> 03:45.717
So, what do you say?

03:45.892 --> 03:49.919
I guess we could use some food
in our lovemaking.

03:50.697 --> 03:54.428
Okay, we got your--
Got your strawberries.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.569
Your chocolate sauce.

03:56.769 --> 04:00.136
Your pastrami on rye with mustard.

04:00.707 --> 04:02.072
-Your honey--
-Wait.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.142
Pastrami on rye with mustard?

04:04.344 --> 04:05.709
Don't you remember they--?

04:05.878 --> 04:08.540
They used pastrami in that movie,
<i>9 1/2 Weeks</i>.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.275
-Remember the pastrami scene?
-No.

04:11.451 --> 04:13.180
Well, maybe it was <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

04:13.353 --> 04:16.015
Whatever it was, it worked.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.459
-Didn't go for it, huh?
-No.

04:21.628 --> 04:25.826
So she didn't appreciate the erotic
qualities of the salted-cured meats.

04:28.501 --> 04:32.562
She tolerated the strawberries
and the chocolate sauce...

04:32.872 --> 04:35.033
...but it's not a meal, you know?

04:35.642 --> 04:38.372
Food and sex.
Those are my two passions.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.876
It's only natural to combine them.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.403
Natural?

04:42.582 --> 04:46.609
Sex is about love between a man and
a woman, not a man and a sandwich.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.788
Jerry, I'm not suggesting
getting rid of the girl.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.446
She's integral.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.092
Maybe instead of trying
to satisfy two of your needs...

04:54.260 --> 04:56.956
...how about satisfying one
of somebody else's?

04:58.331 --> 05:00.925
Speaking of which,
I found a way to separate the skin...

05:01.100 --> 05:03.933
...from the top of the pudding
without leaving any on the edges.

05:04.103 --> 05:05.798
X-Acto knife.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.430
I told you, George, no more pudding.
I'm starting a purification program.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.839
Keep all that kind of food
away from me.

05:12.011 --> 05:16.311
Well, then I guess these would be
out of the question.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.546
What the hell is that?

05:18.985 --> 05:21.351
Pudding skin singles.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.181
Hey, buddy.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.794
Hey, I'm borrowing
all your Tupperware.

05:31.464 --> 05:34.865
-Why?
-Closed my account at the blood bank.

05:36.235 --> 05:38.032
What? It's here? It's in the building?

05:38.204 --> 05:39.694
Right across the hall.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.999
-What, you wanna go see it?
-No, I don't.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.076
In fact, if even one corpuscle
of that blood...

05:45.244 --> 05:49.112
...should find its way across that hall,
I will freak out on you, Kramer.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.216
Freak out.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.877
You know, for a fat guy,
you're not very jolly.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.954
Hey. Working out?

06:01.127 --> 06:03.061
You know it.
And I ditched all my junk food.

06:03.229 --> 06:04.719
What the heck is going on here?

06:04.897 --> 06:07.024
Sorry, buddy, cleaned house.
All health food.

06:07.633 --> 06:11.000
Well, I may have to take it,
but I don't have to like it.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.605
Vivian left me a message.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.003
I guess a certain someone...

06:16.175 --> 06:18.973
...changed her mind whether
someone was responsible enough...

06:19.145 --> 06:20.737
...to watch a certain other someone.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.744
-Is this about me?
-No.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.473
Then I've lost interest.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.808
Vivian. Hi, it's Elaine.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.045
Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's.
I got your message.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.121
What?

06:31.324 --> 06:33.918
Yeah, he's right here. Hold on.

06:34.093 --> 06:37.085
For me? Go.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.599
Yeah. What--? Yeah. Tonight?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.261
Yeah, I'll be there.

06:42.702 --> 06:43.930
Yeah, later.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.934
Well, somebody's babysitting.

06:46.105 --> 06:48.835
You? I'm more responsible
than you are.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.236
Don't be ridiculous.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.641
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
fill my freezer with my own blood.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.659
Oh, Tara.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.064
Hello, Vivian?

07:19.672 --> 07:22.266
Boy, this is a nice screen.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.600
-Kramer.
-Don't take my money.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.177
It is me, you idiot.

07:28.314 --> 07:31.715
Hi. You gotta get out of here. I'm
gonna babysit the hell out of that kid.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.647
Wait a minute, I'm the babysitter.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.118
No, no. You're out. I'm in.
Now, hit the road.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.390
Elaine.

07:42.562 --> 07:43.722
What are you doing here?

07:44.497 --> 07:48.126
Kramer is actually sleeping one off,
so I thought that I would help out.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.997
What is--? You got some raccoons
or something.

07:53.072 --> 07:56.872
Well, I guess this will be all right.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.443
Jimmy, you remember Elaine.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.239
She's gonna watch you tonight.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.574
Hi, Jimmy.

08:10.189 --> 08:11.713
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:11.891 --> 08:13.950
I thought you were supposed
to be babysitting.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.855
There was an incident.

08:16.295 --> 08:19.128
Oh, no. Where's the blood?

08:19.298 --> 08:21.289
-It's in here, isn't it?
-Will you stop it?

08:21.467 --> 08:22.832
What is this?

08:23.002 --> 08:24.799
It's Jell-O.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.999
What about this?
This is blood, isn't it?

08:28.174 --> 08:29.573
This is tomato juice. Look.

08:29.742 --> 08:32.404
Oh, you're sick. You're sick.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.102
Will you calm down.
I took all my blood down to Newman's.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.010
He let me put it in his meat freezer.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.580
Hey, what's going on?
Who made pudding?

08:40.119 --> 08:41.450
Oh, yeah. George, he came by.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.385
He made more of those pudding skin
singles. They're delicious.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.115
Damn that, George.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.726
I told him I didn't want this stuff
around anymore.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.522
Heads up.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.993
You're dead, President Lincoln.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.429
You're dead.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.269
I wish I was dead.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.100
Can I have your juice?

09:01.274 --> 09:03.606
As long as you don't--

09:04.310 --> 09:06.335
Thanks for the refill.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.214
Hey, Elaine. How did it go?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.410
Oh, he's a-- He's a joy.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.988
Really? Some sitters have told me
he's a bit of a handful.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.717
Oh, handful of sunshine.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.255
I wish I could do this every day.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.887
Elaine, that's so good to hear.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.556
I've been having
a few health problems lately.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.464
-It's not serious, is it?
-Well, it might be.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.571
Well, just in case
anything does happen...

09:33.739 --> 09:36.139
...it's nice to know there's
somebody like you around.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.104
Oh, yeah. That--

09:39.579 --> 09:40.637
That is nice to know.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.085
Hey, Jerry, it's okay. I'm right here.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.851
I can see that. What happened?

09:54.293 --> 09:57.729
Well, that--
That knife it...nicked your jugular.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.990
You know, Jerry,
when somebody yells, "Heads up"...

10:01.167 --> 10:04.364
...you're not supposed to
actually look up.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.799
I'll remember that.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.702
Anyway, you're lucky I was there.
You lost a lot of blood.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.138
-What?
-Oh, yeah.

10:12.311 --> 10:15.303
You got three pints
of Kramer in you, buddy.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.151
Three pints of Kramer's blood?

10:28.594 --> 10:31.495
I can feel his blood inside of me.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.132
Borrowing things from my blood.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.996
Well, so much for purification week.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.972
So how's the fornicating gourmet?

10:45.945 --> 10:47.936
Doing quite well, thank you.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.912
Yesterday I had a soft-boiled egg
and a quickie.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.711
You know what?

10:53.886 --> 10:57.253
If I could add TV to the equation,
that would really be the ultimate.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.254
George, we're trying
to have a civilization here.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.051
-Hey.
-Hey, how was babysitting?

11:03.229 --> 11:04.355
Oh, just great.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.363
I found out that Vivian's got
some sort of a medical problem...

11:07.533 --> 11:10.832
...and if the worst happens,
she wants me to take care of Jimmy.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.801
-Well, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
-It doesn't matter.

11:13.973 --> 11:17.033
I mean, if anything happens to her,
I'm on deck.

11:17.209 --> 11:22.977
Scissor mishap, air show disaster,
Chinese organ thieves.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.913
-It's a dangerous world.
-She's right.

11:26.085 --> 11:29.851
I heard Kramer got mugged out
in the suburbs on a babysitting gig.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.190
Really?

11:35.361 --> 11:36.350
Look at this.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.463
Look at the hair
on the back of my neck.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.729
It's all brambly. See?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.595
It's like a thicket back there.

11:43.502 --> 11:45.800
Look, I need somebody
to shave it for me.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.872
I'm not touching that thing.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.910
Well, I have to say
I'm very surprised.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.569
And disappointed, blood brother.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.271
Oh, no.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.475
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.983
Listen to your pulse.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.449
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.084
-Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
-Oh, so my blood's not enough?

12:09.261 --> 12:11.889
Would you like a kidney too?
Because I'll give it to you.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.761
I'll rip it out right here
and smack it on the table.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.394
All right, all right. I'll do it. Sit down.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.870
No, no. I don't have time right now.

12:22.041 --> 12:26.239
I'll catch you tonight. We'll do sort of
an all over kind of thing, all right?

12:30.116 --> 12:31.105
Hello?

12:31.283 --> 12:33.774
Kramer called.
He told us you were in the hospital.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.250
Kramer called you?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.911
He calls every week.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.488
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.924
-He says he's fine.
-Tell him to eat a plum.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.731
Jerry, you really have to take
better care of yourself.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.630
We bought you some sessions
with a personal trainer.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.862
I don't need a personal trainer.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.970
All right, I gotta go.
We'll talk about this later.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.507
<i>Plum.</i>

12:58.210 --> 13:00.440
Why are you calling my parents?

13:01.514 --> 13:05.109
Well, maybe if you called more often,
I wouldn't have to.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.013
-Is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
-Why here?

13:10.189 --> 13:12.555
I'm taping Canadian parliament,
you know, on C-SPAN.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.184
Okay.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.620
Is it all right if I watch in your
bedroom? Because your bed is nice.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.198
Fine.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.028
Okay.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:26.505 --> 13:28.632
No, no, I do not want that in here.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.703
Blood?

13:31.443 --> 13:33.206
All right.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.309
Hello, doughboy.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.475
Mr. Mandelbaum,
you're the personal trainer?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.087
I'm here to whip you into shape.

13:43.255 --> 13:46.986
So grab your jock if you need one.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.990
It's go time.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.362
Elaine? Elaine?

13:54.800 --> 13:57.064
Oh, hey. Oh, God.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.170
I didn't hear you come in.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.327
Where's Jimmy?

14:01.207 --> 14:04.665
I don't know. I don't know.
We had Ho Hos for dinner and then--

14:04.844 --> 14:07.904
And then he put this plastic bag
over his head...

14:08.080 --> 14:10.344
...and started running around
until he got tired...

14:10.516 --> 14:12.780
...and he laid down somewhere.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.678
I tell you,
I'm no good at watching that kid.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.849
Sleeping like an angel.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.848
Elaine, you're the best.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.686
No. I'm a scatter-brain.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.627
It's probably why I can't hold a job
or keep a man.

14:26.265 --> 14:27.527
You're a riot.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.191
-You gonna watch Jimmy tomorrow?
-All right.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.000
But I'm running out of purses here.

14:35.741 --> 14:38.073
Okay, Mr. Mandelbaum,
what do you want me to do?

14:38.244 --> 14:40.178
Drop your purse, honey...

14:40.346 --> 14:43.406
...and pick up that medicine ball.

14:45.651 --> 14:48.643
Is this a gym
or some kind of fitness museum?

14:48.821 --> 14:51.949
Not funny. Over your head with it.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.887
-Are you ready?
-For what?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.959
All aboard the pain train.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.230
How many sessions
did my parents pay for?

15:02.401 --> 15:05.234
Not enough to make
a man of you, daffodil.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.971
Spicy mustard.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.581
You are hot tonight.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.009
Oh, George.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.883
Now for the trifecta.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.589
George?

15:33.699 --> 15:34.688
George?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.625
What are you doing?

15:39.038 --> 15:40.972
Pleasuring you.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.870
-What is this?
-We're making sausages.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.447
I thought you were gonna watch
a video.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.487
Well, yeah. An instructional video
on how to make your own sausages.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.954
-Kramer, I'm not in the mood for this.
-All right.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.854
Newman, let's go grab
some mail sacks...

16:02.027 --> 16:04.359
...and haul these beauties out of here.

16:11.003 --> 16:14.632
Blood over there, sausage over here.
I'm living in a slaughterhouse.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.172
Tonight I want you to sleep on this.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.208
Toughens the vertebrae.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.341
What in holy hell.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.947
Sausages.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.376
-Is this your diet?
-No, they're not mine--

16:27.553 --> 16:29.578
Don't lie to me, butterbean.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.852
We're taking it up a notch.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.928
So the free love buffet is over?

16:38.063 --> 16:39.155
I got greedy.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.823
I flew too close to the sun
on wings of pastrami.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.529
Yeah, that's what you did.

16:47.606 --> 16:50.200
I can't believe I got another session
with Izzy Mandelbaum.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.901
He's probably gonna make me
box a kangaroo.

16:54.780 --> 16:55.838
What's going on?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.546
I don't know.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.214
This sandwich is making me flush.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.517
Oh, no. I'll tell you
what you did, Caligula.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.393
You've combined food and sex into
one disgusting, uncontrollable urge.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.523
I think you're right.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.222
Are you gonna eat that?

17:14.400 --> 17:17.233
No, but please tell me that's all
you're gonna do with it.

17:17.403 --> 17:20.599
Jerry, I tell you, if this woman dies...

17:20.772 --> 17:23.867
...it is gonna
be a major inconvenience.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.068
These fries are really, really good.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.474
All right, that's enough of that.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.205
I mean, I can't shake this woman.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.816
You know, now I gotta go
to Jimmy's birthday party.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.143
Sleepy.

17:37.456 --> 17:41.620
I mean, no matter what I do,
I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.490
Sleepy here's quite a weasel.
Maybe he can bat for you.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.059
Yeah. That's what I need.
A pinch weasel.

17:49.835 --> 17:53.293
-Why did you get rid of that sausage?
-It wasn't me. It was Mr. Mandelbaum.

17:53.472 --> 17:57.169
Well, Newman's not happy.
He booted me out of his freezer.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.505
I gotta take my blood
back to the bank.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.805
-Can I borrow your car?
-What's wrong with yours?

18:01.980 --> 18:05.006
Well, I got no a.c. and I gotta
keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.778
All right, but this is the last favor.
Okay? We're even.

18:07.953 --> 18:10.353
All right. Even-Steven, okay?

18:10.522 --> 18:13.514
Oh, by the way, when you get back
to your apartment...

18:13.692 --> 18:16.252
...keep it down because
Newman's taking a nap in your bed.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.336
Oh, man.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.171
What is that?

18:40.252 --> 18:44.689
"lf the engine begins to overheat
turn off air conditioner."

18:45.124 --> 18:47.354
Never. I can't do that.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.460
Oh, Mama.

19:04.042 --> 19:07.034
This thing is bone dry.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.487
Vivian.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.317
-Elaine.
-Hi.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.652
This is my friend, George.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.261
-I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
-Okay.

19:25.430 --> 19:26.658
You're up.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.765
-Isn't Elaine fantastic?
-Yes, she is.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.461
It's-- It's a pity we won't be seeing
much more of her.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.732
-Really? Why?
-You haven't heard?

19:35.908 --> 19:39.036
No, she's going to live with her
grandparents in Pennsylvania.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.941
Her grandparents passed away
five years ago.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.342
Yes, they did.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.173
I was covering.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.781
Elaine has been deported
back to Scotland.

19:48.954 --> 19:51.548
She's an American citizen.
I've seen her passport.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.150
All right, no more lies.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.594
Elaine has been chosen to represent
the Upper West Side...

19:57.763 --> 20:00.527
...in the next Biosphere project.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.196
I haven't heard anything
about another Biosphere.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.762
That's because it's underwater.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.371
This is insane.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.036
-Is it?
-Yes, it is.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.542
Well, it's all for charity,
so, what's the difference?

20:15.547 --> 20:18.380
You are very knowledgeable.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.881
I'm-- I'm also an architect.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.917
-Is that pastrami?
-Yes, it is.

20:29.461 --> 20:34.728
I find the pastrami to be the most
sensual of all the salted-cured meats.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.564
-Hungry?
-Very.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.397
Wait.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.675
Vivian!

20:52.284 --> 20:53.911
Is this really necessary?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.281
If you wanna live
in a butcher shop...

20:56.455 --> 20:58.980
...I'm gonna treat you
like a piece of meat.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.185
What if I can't keep up?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.918
You lag, you drag.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.592
-Fire it up, son.
-Right, Dad.

21:05.764 --> 21:09.131
-Mandelbaum. Mandelbaum.
-Mandelbaum. Mandelbaum.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.697
Move it. Move it. Move it.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.101
Get those knees up.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.133
Come on. Kick it. Kick it.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.448
What's going on?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.810
There's something wrong
with your car.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.111
It's dripping something on my feet.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.812
Yeah. Some kind of red liquid.

21:30.989 --> 21:32.650
Oh, my God. The blood.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.452
Blood?

21:37.663 --> 21:39.358
Get up, boy. Get up.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.897
We got a problem here.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.997
Tough it out. This is for real.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.331
You gotta want it.

21:49.174 --> 21:50.801
So how far did they drag you?

21:50.976 --> 21:54.468
Well, for the first quarter-mile
they thought I was just dogging it.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.344
Hi, George.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.142
Hi, Jimmy.

21:58.383 --> 22:01.819
Yeah, Jimmy,
why don't you go wait outside.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.012
You know, play with something.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.893
-What's the kid doing here?
-I'm babysitting.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.527
Vivian asked me to raise him
if she doesn't make it.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.564
Oh, that's a drag.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.495
That kid.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.193
You put blood in the car?

22:19.871 --> 22:21.031
Jerry, it was overheating.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.037
You should take
better care of that thing.

22:23.208 --> 22:26.336
Well, they told me I got more blood,
so I guess I owe you again.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.002
-You didn't get the blood from me.
-Then who?

22:31.116 --> 22:32.174
Hello, Jerry.
