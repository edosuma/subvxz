WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:07.608
Ahh.
(Cup clinking)

00:10.211 --> 00:11.545
Okay, I'm just going
to come out and say it.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.281
I'm going to ask
Emma to marry me.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.515
And I just wanted
to stop by here

00:14.548 --> 00:16.417
to get your
permission first.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.686
Well, that's not
up to me.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.954
You have to ask
Emma about that.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.223
No, I know.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.058
But it's tradition,
so I just wanted to...

00:24.092 --> 00:26.160
Where?

00:26.194 --> 00:28.229
Every...
everywhere, I thought.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.797
But, maybe they
don't do it in Sweden
but I don't...

00:29.830 --> 00:31.265
Viveka?
Viveka:
(Speaking in Swedish)

00:31.299 --> 00:32.400
No, no, you don't
have to involve her.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.203
Bruce wants our
permission to marry Emma.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.437
No, I don't, I just
need your permission.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.672
It's only the fa...
What are you asking for?

00:38.706 --> 00:41.109
A straight yes or no?

00:41.142 --> 00:43.711
Um... yes?

00:43.744 --> 00:44.912
Then it's no.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.216
No, wait.
Wait. I, I...

00:48.249 --> 00:50.651
Listen, I realize maybe
I'm not exactly what
you guys had in mind

00:50.684 --> 00:53.887
for a son-in-law,
but I really love
your daughter.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.557
She's smart
and she's funny
and she's beautiful...

00:56.590 --> 00:58.292
Tall.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.894
And tall.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.397
God, I feel really
vulnerable saying
this in front of
you guys right now

01:03.431 --> 01:05.766
but I... I want to be
together with her forever.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.736
Aww!
And make her
happy every day.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.540
And I just wanted
you two to know that,
because it's true.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.607
And will always be true.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.410
Oh-ohh!
That's so nice, Bruce!

01:17.778 --> 01:20.181
But still no.

01:20.214 --> 01:23.151
* We're not living in America

01:23.184 --> 01:26.620
* But we're not sorry

01:26.654 --> 01:28.189
* I knew there
was something *

01:28.222 --> 01:30.258
* That we never had

01:30.291 --> 01:33.394
* We don't worry

01:33.427 --> 01:36.697
* No, we're not
living in America *

01:36.730 --> 01:40.534
* But we're not sorry, no

01:40.568 --> 01:43.837
* We don't care about
the world today *

01:43.871 --> 01:46.774
* We're not sorry

01:46.807 --> 01:49.910
* For you

01:49.943 --> 01:53.914
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

01:53.947 --> 01:55.048
* Ahh

01:57.618 --> 01:58.986
As you all know,

01:59.019 --> 02:01.722
we have hired a new
head of marketing,
and this is Diane.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.023
Thanks Olof.
I was...

02:03.056 --> 02:04.858
And of course,
her being here

02:04.892 --> 02:06.427
does not affect
my status at all.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.029
I'm still the boss
here, so, yeah.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.732
Diane:
Okay, great, thanks.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.201
It's great to be here.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.768
As Olof said,

02:14.802 --> 02:18.239
I am here to change
this bank's image.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.140
So, here's a
question for you:

02:20.174 --> 02:22.410
What is the most
important thing

02:22.443 --> 02:25.179
about the banking
business? Anyone?

02:25.213 --> 02:26.747
No one?

02:26.780 --> 02:29.016
Blondie, what's your name?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.384
Emma.
Any idea?

02:30.418 --> 02:31.619
Uh, money?

02:31.652 --> 02:32.986
Money?
(Laughing)

02:33.020 --> 02:35.088
No, not money.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.657
It's people.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.593
Banks are about people.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.396
Nobody wants a bunch
of grumpy guys and gals

02:42.430 --> 02:43.964
handling their money.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.499
(Mocking tone)
"Hi, my name is Sven,

02:45.533 --> 02:47.601
"and I'd like to take
care of your money

02:47.635 --> 02:52.172
but first, give me a second
to be even more bor-ing."

02:52.206 --> 02:56.410
(Speaking in Swedish)

02:56.444 --> 02:58.379
Diane:
Let's start here.
Everybody, gather 'round here.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.515
Come on. This'll be fun.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.883
All right? Get in,
get a little closer.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.152
There we go. Okay.
Everybody say,

03:05.185 --> 03:06.720
"cream cheese!"

03:06.754 --> 03:09.323
All:
Cream cheese.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.724
(Shutter clicking)
Great!

03:10.758 --> 03:12.226
Okay.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.929
That is step one
to changing the
image of this bank.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.831
Now everybody,
give me your accounts

03:17.865 --> 03:19.400
and I will tag you all.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.434
Emma?

03:20.468 --> 03:22.169
I don't have one.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.839
How is that even possible?
What do you do with your day?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.375
I work.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.010
Social media is an
important part of work.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.745
You've got to get
your message out there.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.880
Who do you want to be?

03:32.913 --> 03:34.181
Do you want to be
cool, exciting Emma

03:34.214 --> 03:35.849
or lame and boring Sven?

03:35.883 --> 03:40.421
(Speaking in Swedish)

03:40.454 --> 03:44.258
(Music)

03:44.292 --> 03:46.494
Bruce, don't take
this personally,

03:46.527 --> 03:47.728
it's not you.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.630
It has nothing
to do with you.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.065
Although I have
to admit the timing
is not great

03:52.099 --> 03:53.967
since you still
don't have a job,

03:54.001 --> 03:55.703
or money, or...

03:55.736 --> 03:58.138
I mean, it's not
like you're going
to grow any taller.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.408
Yeah, it doesn't feel
personal at all.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.476
No, no, it's
just our family.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.412
We don't do marriage.
We don't believe in it.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.014
It doesn't mean
anything to us.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.617
(Shouting in Swedish)

04:09.650 --> 04:12.219
Okay, well it means
something to me, okay?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.655
It's what people do when
they love each other.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.689
You have my permission, Bruce.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.257
Oh, thanks, man.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.427
But that doesn't
help me at all.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.163
(Bouncing thuds)

04:25.733 --> 04:27.167
You know what,
technically,

04:27.200 --> 04:28.369
it's only the father's
permission that I need.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.304
So if you could
just... give me a...

04:30.338 --> 04:32.373
Plus, you know who's married?

04:32.406 --> 04:34.107
Adolf Hitler.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.509
Josef Fritzl.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.910
George Clooney.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.979
Is this really a club
you want to be part of?

04:39.012 --> 04:41.915
Okay, I think you're
being a little bit
ridiculous about this.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.150
Wait, George Clooney?

04:43.183 --> 04:45.252
Also, Emma doesn't
believe in marriage.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.356
She hates the concept
of marriage.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.458
Don't you know that?
It's not true.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.192
Have you ever talked
to her about it?

04:52.225 --> 04:53.160
Yes!

04:55.162 --> 04:57.230
I mean, not like...

04:57.264 --> 04:58.632
Not specifically,
but there is...

04:58.666 --> 04:59.833
Do you think you're
the first guy

04:59.867 --> 05:01.735
who's ever asked
her to marry him?

05:01.769 --> 05:04.538
(Laughter)

05:04.572 --> 05:06.440
Yeah.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.175
Oh.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.209
Okay, you know what,

05:09.242 --> 05:10.411
this was a mistake.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.012
This is supposed to be
just a formality.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.313
Okay?

05:13.347 --> 05:14.782
And you know what?
I'm going to ask her.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.749
Just so you know.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.920
Viveka:
Nej men Bruce?

05:24.224 --> 05:27.160
(Speaking in Swedish)

05:32.866 --> 05:33.901
(Quietly)
Yes!

05:33.934 --> 05:36.470
(Music)

05:38.972 --> 05:44.412
(Music)

05:44.445 --> 05:45.813
Emma:
Hey, honey.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.280
Hey.
Hey.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.252
Are you okay?

05:52.285 --> 05:53.286
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.321
Yeah?
Yeah.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.424
So, what have
you been up to?

05:56.457 --> 05:58.158
Nothing special.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.394
Any luck on
the job hunt?

06:00.428 --> 06:02.830
Still a limited
market for overly
qualified Americans

06:02.863 --> 06:05.365
who don't speak
Swedish.
Aw-w-w.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.468
Maybe I should just
go back to looking
for accounting jobs.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.369
No, we're fine, babe.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.805
I mean, you should do
whatever makes you happy.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.074
If we had more money
I could buy a little
happiness.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.410
(Music)

06:16.444 --> 06:18.646
Oh, we had an American
start at work today.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.615
She took a group photo
of us and posted it online.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.384
Because "banks are
about people".

06:24.418 --> 06:26.119
On the bank's account?
Yeah.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.655
I've never seen anything
posted on there.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.789
Well, now there is.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.025
Oh my God, have you seen
yourself on this?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.594
You look so bored.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.696
Emma:
What?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.665
There's tons of
comments on here.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.802
Hey, um,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.637
we've actually
never really
talked about it,

06:43.671 --> 06:46.206
so, like...
what do you...

06:46.239 --> 06:48.208
How... What is your
take on marriage?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.943
What's up with
all the hearts?

06:49.977 --> 06:51.311
It just means that
people like the photo.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.046
Oh, my God, this
is out of control,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.782
there's so many
comments.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.918
Look, someone wrote hashtag
"Chairman of the Board".

06:57.951 --> 06:59.319
That's not so bad.
No, the "bored",

06:59.352 --> 07:00.721
like B-O-R-E-D.

07:00.754 --> 07:01.922
Oh.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.956
Listen...

07:02.990 --> 07:04.692
So, um, marriage,
what is the...

07:04.725 --> 07:06.093
It's not a big thing
in Sweden.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.095
We have "sambo"
for people who
live together.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.030
"Is she in a coma?"

07:10.063 --> 07:12.800
"Can someone pull
the stick out of her ass?"

07:12.833 --> 07:14.702
What does that
even mean?

07:14.735 --> 07:17.137
(In Swedish)

07:17.170 --> 07:18.606
I know what it means.
Sorry.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.674
Oh, my God.
Thought it was a
translation problem...

07:20.708 --> 07:22.242
I can't breathe.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.512
(Exhaling)

07:24.545 --> 07:27.481
Wow, this has been
re-posted, like,
450 times already.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.016
Is that bad?

07:29.049 --> 07:31.451
No, it's... it's...

07:31.485 --> 07:34.254
It's not a
contest. Okay?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.690
So... you're not
into weddings, or...?

07:36.724 --> 07:39.627
Swedish weddings are endless
and super expensive.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.596
Why not just take
the money and go to
Thailand instead...

07:42.630 --> 07:46.233
Why? Who's getting
married?

07:46.266 --> 07:48.836
No one, I guess.

07:48.869 --> 07:53.541
(Music)

07:53.574 --> 07:56.143
Bruce! What time
is it there, midnight?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.045
No, it's 2:00
in the afternoon.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.313
Oh, man, I can never
figure that out. Okay.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.915
So how are you,
what's going on?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.117
How is your
way-too-hot-for-you
girlfriend?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.418
Good, she's good.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.254
I'm actually thinking
of proposing to her.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.589
Smart move, you know,

08:08.622 --> 08:09.857
if someone's way out
of your league

08:09.890 --> 08:11.792
you got to make sure
to lock that down.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.327
Yeah, I wouldn't say
she's way out of my
league, but, you know.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.229
Anyway, I don't even know
if she wants to get married.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.598
You know to be honest,
it doesn't seem

08:17.631 --> 08:19.533
like marriage is such
a big deal here in Sweden.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.334
Yeah, but she's going
to feel differently

08:21.368 --> 08:24.471
once she see's,
a... ling-a
ling-a ling-a ling.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.673
The what?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.074
That rocka-docka-
docka-docka?

08:27.107 --> 08:28.441
I don't know what
you're saying.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.843
The ring, Bruce,
the ring,

08:29.877 --> 08:31.078
oh my God,
it's slang.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.279
You got to keep up
with that, man.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.715
Okay, listen,
let me see the ring.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.116
Well I actually
haven't bought it yet.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.484
All right,
enough about you.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.620
You know how every city
has, like, a guy?

08:39.653 --> 08:42.489
You know when you go
to the city, and the
guy shows you around.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.091
Rome has a guy

08:44.124 --> 08:46.526
and he helps you
cut in line
at the Vatican.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.496
Who's the guy,
the guy I should
talk to in Sweden?

08:49.529 --> 08:50.698
I don't know...

08:50.731 --> 08:52.299
Well, maybe you
should be the guy.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.134
'Cause I got a friend,
he's coming on Thursday

08:54.167 --> 08:55.569
and he's going
to need a guy.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.638
I don't think
I'm qualified to be the guy.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.307
Yeah, you are!
You got to help
me out Bruce.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.175
I already promised
him and now it's
out of my hands.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.543
So... so you...
you can do it.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.945
It's easy money,
you be the guy.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.313
No, I don't want
to be the guy.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.548
Okay it's handled then,
great talking to you.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.683
No, no, no,
it's not handled!

09:09.717 --> 09:11.585
Oka-a-ay! Peace.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.587
No! I said... I...

09:13.621 --> 09:14.554
Argh.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.490
(Camera click)

09:18.626 --> 09:20.160
Hi-i-i.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.662
I think we need to talk.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.364
Um. Did you see all the
comments on that photo?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.066
Yeah, great isn't it?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.268
No, no...
It was all about me.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.670
About the Chairman
of the Bored.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.772
(Laughing)
Yeah, I saw that.
It was pretty funny.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.675
It was horrible,
you have to take it down!

09:34.708 --> 09:36.777
Okay.
I'll take it down.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.748
I will take down
the most popular and
commented-on photo

09:40.781 --> 09:43.416
this bank
has ever seen...
(Sharp inhale)

09:43.450 --> 09:44.952
Okay, it's erased.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.019
Thank you.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.055
You've got to work
with me here, Emma.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.658
I'm in charge of turning
this bank's image around.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.192
It's what I do.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.629
I've turned around
the images of some
horrible organizations.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.397
"Oil Lovers of America",

09:57.430 --> 09:59.432
"Fathers Against
Mothers Driving"

09:59.466 --> 10:01.434
"The Unibrow Society".

10:01.468 --> 10:04.404
But this, this might be
the toughest one yet.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.674
Okay, I'll take a picture
for the website.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.676
But it's going to be one
that I choose, okay?

10:08.709 --> 10:09.643
Yes!

10:12.612 --> 10:14.081
Eh, Gustaf...

10:15.515 --> 10:18.451
(Speaking in Swedish)

10:27.627 --> 10:28.729
(Silent mouthing)

11:19.813 --> 11:20.748
(Whine)

11:22.082 --> 11:24.517
Just act natural
and give us a smile.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.354
Okay, that's
just creepy.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.655
Stop it, you're
freaking me out.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.357
What?
Try again.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.461
Is that seriously
your natural look?

11:34.494 --> 11:35.695
I think so.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.131
No, okay. You now what?
Um, up on your feet.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.700
We got to get
the blood flowing.
What? Okay...

11:40.734 --> 11:42.035
Let's get it shaking,
let's get it shaking...

11:42.069 --> 11:43.904
Oh, okay...
(In Swedish)

11:43.937 --> 11:46.139
Let's get it shaking...
And jumping jacks!

11:46.173 --> 11:49.042
Jumping jacks! Jumping
jacks! Jumping jacks!
Jumping jacks!

11:49.076 --> 11:54.181
And running man!
Running man! Running
man! Running man...

11:54.214 --> 11:55.615
(Laughing)
This is so hilar...

11:55.648 --> 11:57.350
Hee! Okay...

11:57.384 --> 11:59.319
All right, give me
some laughter, give
me some laughter.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.353
Ho, ho, ho, ho...

12:00.387 --> 12:02.055
(Both)
Ho, ho, ho, ho...

12:02.089 --> 12:04.557
(Both)
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

12:04.591 --> 12:07.294
(Both)
Hee, hee, hee, hee...

12:07.327 --> 12:08.328
(Laughing)

12:08.361 --> 12:09.997
All right, okay,
try again.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.599
Okay, here we go.

12:12.632 --> 12:13.566
(Clears throat)

12:16.036 --> 12:17.704
You look exactly
the same.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.572
I don't even know
how you do that.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.109
Oh my god, maybe
I'm just naturally bored.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.411
(Music)

12:26.546 --> 12:29.282
(Music)

12:29.316 --> 12:31.184
(Speaking in Swedish)

12:31.218 --> 12:32.419
Ah, yes.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.753
First of all, I have
no idea what you just said.

12:33.787 --> 12:34.922
Ahh...
Sorry.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.290
Um, I'm looking to propose
to my girlfriend.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.026
Ah, congratulations.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.160
Yes, thank you.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.228
Um, but I'm confused.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.595
Are these your
engagement rings?

12:42.629 --> 12:44.764
Yes, this row
right here.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.567
These diamonds
seem awfully small.
I'll be honest.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.369
These are
Swedish style rings.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.105
The tradition in Sweden
is to have smaller rings.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.507
Not so big and flashy.
Okay...

12:54.541 --> 12:55.542
Smaller diamonds.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.743
Yeah... Okay, well,
I'm American.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.146
So I'm probably going
to want a big rock.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.948
Ah, okay.
Yeah.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.083
I see. I think I know
what you're looking for.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.051
Okay.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.754
Yeah, now
we're talking!

13:07.787 --> 13:09.389
Yes, these
are... yeah.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.723
How much is
this one right here?

13:10.757 --> 13:13.593
That's 200,000
Swedish crowns.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.695
It's about $25,000.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.299
It's so pretty.
Hmm...

13:19.332 --> 13:21.301
So beautiful.
Yeah.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.936
Um, you said
these other ones,

13:22.970 --> 13:24.704
these smaller ones,
are more traditional Swedish?

13:24.737 --> 13:26.639
Well, it's not
really tradition...

13:26.673 --> 13:27.774
I don't want to
break tradition.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.242
No, no, no, there
are plenty of women

13:29.276 --> 13:32.946
who prefer these
American-style rings
these days.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.615
Well you know what,
I think we should
go with these.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.649
You think so?
Yeah.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.351
Just go really
traditional.

13:38.385 --> 13:49.496
(Music)

13:49.529 --> 13:50.931
Bruce:
Honey, I'm home!

13:50.964 --> 13:52.665
Hi.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.067
Hey, how's it going?

13:54.101 --> 13:55.235
It's awful, just awful.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.504
This "Chairman of the Bored"
photo is everywhere.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.605
It's gone viral.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.639
Come on,
can't be that bad.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.574
Can't be that?
Look at this.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.612
Bruce:
Oh my god, you've
become a meme.

14:05.645 --> 14:06.813
What? What's that?

14:06.846 --> 14:10.250
Maime... mei...
mei-me. Meim.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.518
I don't know,
it's m-e-m-e.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.819
I don't know how
it's pronounced. Meme.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.853
What's a meme?

14:13.887 --> 14:14.922
That.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.624
(Sighing)
I have to fix this.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.658
Meme!

14:18.691 --> 14:19.893
But, who cares!

14:19.927 --> 14:22.629
But it just... I just
want you to know what it...

14:22.662 --> 14:23.830
is before you...

14:23.863 --> 14:25.899
(Laughing)

14:25.933 --> 14:27.334
(Door closing)

14:27.367 --> 14:30.303
(Speaking Swedish)

14:55.895 --> 14:57.597
I want it to look
relaxed, okay?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.566
Like: I don't know
you're taking this picture.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.202
Like:
I'm surprised. Okay?
Okay, sure.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.436
So...
(Gasp)

15:06.706 --> 15:08.375
Are you... Did you
take the picture?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.477
I'm sorry, I missed it.
Was it... I...

15:10.510 --> 15:12.912
Come on, focus.
I can't, I'm, I...

15:12.946 --> 15:14.181
Okay, I'll count
to three. Okay.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.983
Three.
One, two, three!

15:20.420 --> 15:22.255
It... I'm... I don't know,
I think I hit the wrong button.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.290
You got to be
kidding me!

15:23.323 --> 15:24.591
I'm sorry. You know...
Come on.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.693
It's easier if you just
act natural, okay?

15:26.726 --> 15:28.061
That's what I'm doing.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.263
Okay, and we got it.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.231
Okay.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.337
Okay, natural.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.139
More natural...

15:39.172 --> 15:41.941
Way more natural, no,
the opposite of that.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.810
Yep, no, well...

15:43.843 --> 15:45.512
Okay, not like you're
squeezing out a fart.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.614
(Laughing)
Come on!
(Camera click)

15:47.647 --> 15:49.682
There. I got it!

15:49.716 --> 15:51.584
Look.
Oh, that's really good.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.086
I know,
it's perfect, right?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.587
Yeah.
And now it's done.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.523
And now...

15:56.556 --> 15:57.724
(Kissing)

15:57.757 --> 15:59.492
I need you to
come with me.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.828
Why?
You'll see.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.930
(Music)

16:03.963 --> 16:05.332
(Chuckling)

16:07.367 --> 16:08.635
Good news! I'm moving in.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.204
Check it out.
Some idiot left

16:11.238 --> 16:13.840
a full bottle of champagne
out in the courtyard.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.142
Let's celebrate!

16:16.309 --> 16:18.378
Is this the surprise?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.347
It's a surprise...

16:23.816 --> 16:25.718
Mmm, this is good.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.421
I think this is really
expensive champagne.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.590
Yes, it is.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.792
Yeah, I was actually
thinking of proposing
to Emma tonight.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.861
Tonight? Here?

16:34.894 --> 16:36.396
When I'm around?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.665
(Chuckling)
Bad idea, Bruce.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.133
You know, sometimes
I don't even think

16:40.167 --> 16:42.169
she's want to
get married.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.503
All women want
to get married.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.039
It's just the way you ask.
You got to go big.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.007
You think?
Yeah, I could help.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.810
I got lots of ideas,
I'm really creative.
This is my thing.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.745
No, you know what,
I don't need your help on this.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.314
I insist, Bruce!
No!

16:54.347 --> 16:56.216
For you letting me stay here,
it's the least I can do.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.218
No, I don't...
Bruce, let me think...

17:00.753 --> 17:02.222
Is that you thinking,
or...?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.593
Bungee jump proposal.
A what?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.461
She's walking down
the street, right?

17:08.495 --> 17:10.497
And then you bungee jump
down at the right time.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.100
You come down and yell,
"Will yo-o-ou..."

17:13.133 --> 17:14.267
and then you bounce up

17:14.301 --> 17:17.137
and then you down again:
"Marry me-e-e?"

17:17.170 --> 17:18.838
And then bounce up
and then down

17:18.871 --> 17:21.474
and then give her
the ring. Boom.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.410
Okay, that sounds...

17:23.443 --> 17:25.312
hard.
Okay.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.049
Okay, this is you
thinking again, or...?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.818
Flash mob.
A flash mob?

17:31.851 --> 17:33.386
She's walking
down the street.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.322
A bunch of people
she thinks are strangers

17:35.355 --> 17:36.989
start singing and dancing,

17:37.023 --> 17:38.658
and then, bam!

17:38.691 --> 17:41.461
You appear and
propose her then. Boom.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.730
That sounds...
better, at least.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.232
I like the surprise
angle of that.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.567
That might work, actually.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.902
I take that as a "yes".
I call my people.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.004
What people? You have people?

17:52.038 --> 17:53.706
So you know how
there's a guy in Rome

17:53.740 --> 17:56.409
that celebrities pay
to set them up and
show them around?

17:56.443 --> 17:57.677
Mm-hm.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.679
Well, Amy wants me to be
the guy in Stockholm.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.114
Oh, that's great.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.782
I don't know, I don't
think I can be the guy.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.717
Well, it might be tough
to find nice things to say

18:04.751 --> 18:06.486
about Sweden
this time of year.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.455
I mean it's so dark
and depressing.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.956
I don't think that's true.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.691
When the light reflects off
the snow, it's really beautiful.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.426
Plus the air is really
fresh and clean.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.895
When you breathe in,
it's nice...

18:15.928 --> 18:16.963
And I mean,
it's not as cold...

18:16.996 --> 18:19.065
Okay, stop it.
You're too positive.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.734
Actually, you sound like
a great Stockholm Guy.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.503
(Sigh)
Maybe.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.706
Hey, um... Which way
do you walk home from work?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.107
Through Gamla Stan.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.576
Right, and what
street is that?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.811
Väster långgatan. Why?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.413
Oh.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.582
And you go the same way
every day, or...?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.284
You know you don't have
to stalk me, right?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.552
I'm willingly
your girlfriend.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.355
(Chuckling nervously)
I know that. "Stalk me", what...

18:42.389 --> 18:44.123
But serious, you take
the same way every time?

18:44.157 --> 18:46.359
(Music)

18:48.027 --> 18:49.596
(Music)

18:49.629 --> 18:51.298
Okay, everybody!

18:51.331 --> 18:53.333
When Emma's entering
this street,

18:53.366 --> 18:56.203
you and you starts
moving towards her.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.238
You grab her arms
when she passes you

18:58.271 --> 18:59.872
and you start singing.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.842
At the same time,
Bruce and the marching band

19:02.875 --> 19:04.211
comes around the corner.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.113
Bruce singing,
going up to Emma, and kneels

19:07.146 --> 19:10.082
and that's when
I release the doves.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.051
Wait, doves? We talked about
this, I don't want any doves.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.786
You need to
go big, Bruce.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.655
How can you go big
if you have no doves?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.123
That's crazy.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.525
Where do you
even find doves?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.327
Well, it's not doves.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.894
They were way
too expensive.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.531
I just spray-painted
some pigeons white.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.965
I don't know if
this is a good idea.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.001
Trust me, Bruce.
It has to be special.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.803
Do you think
you're the first guy

19:30.837 --> 19:32.805
ever to ask her
to marry him?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.974
Yes, actually, I do.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.108
Oh.

19:36.142 --> 19:39.446
(Music)

19:39.479 --> 19:40.880
Target moving.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.014
Man: (on earpiece)
Target moving.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.983
The chicken is
in the basket.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.151
Get ready, everybody!

19:45.184 --> 19:46.619
You got chickens too?

19:46.653 --> 19:48.087
The package
is delivered.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.822
What package? I don't
know what you're saying.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.157
Emma's coming!
Okay, I am sorry.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.892
Get ready, Emma's
coming, you idiot.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.994
No panic!

19:55.027 --> 19:56.128
Don't panic!

19:56.162 --> 20:05.772
(Music)

20:05.805 --> 20:08.641
* Today's your lucky day

20:08.675 --> 20:09.709
* Cause someone's here...

20:09.742 --> 20:10.743
Emma:
(Speaking Swedish)

20:10.777 --> 20:12.579
(Mixed grunts)

20:15.348 --> 20:17.450
Men:
(Moaning)

20:17.484 --> 20:23.189
(Band music)

20:23.222 --> 20:25.124
* Last but not least

20:25.157 --> 20:27.727
* Comes the man
of your dreams *

20:27.760 --> 20:31.163
* Will you,
will you marry me? *

20:31.197 --> 20:32.365
* Wi-i-ill yo-o-ou

20:32.399 --> 20:34.567
* Ma-a-arry me

20:34.601 --> 20:36.869
Oh my god, what happened?

20:36.903 --> 20:38.004
What happened?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.874
Where's Emma?
Did she say yes?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.210
I don't know,
she's not even here!

20:44.243 --> 20:46.012
(Slap)

20:46.045 --> 20:47.780
Maybe they were
just trying to
tell you something.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.049
No, I am telling you,
they were trying to grab me

20:50.082 --> 20:52.218
and it was really
creepy and weird.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.486
Maybe I should
call the police.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.621
No! No, no, no.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.189
You should just...
move on. You know?

20:57.223 --> 20:58.325
Pretend like it
never happened,

20:58.358 --> 21:00.693
just turn the page.
Mm.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.363
I never asked you:

21:03.396 --> 21:04.731
what do you think
about marriage?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.165
Me?
Yeah.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.835
I'm... pro.
Yeah?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.102
I think it's kind
of nice, actually.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.138
So you want
to get married?

21:12.171 --> 21:13.239
Yeah.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.408
Okay. Let's get
married, then.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.009
(Spits)

21:17.043 --> 21:18.578
Okay.
I can't wait

21:18.611 --> 21:22.449
to get one of these
big, fat American
diamond rings.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.717
Finally having an
American boyfriend pays off.

21:24.751 --> 21:25.818
Yeah.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.587
(Chuckling)

21:27.620 --> 21:29.489
(Doorbell chiming)

21:29.522 --> 21:31.090
Are you expecting
someone, or...?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.492
No.
Okay.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.997
Hey! Heard
you were The Guy.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.267
Are you sure
you don't want me
to post this picture?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.835
I think you look
really beautiful, here.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.037
Aw, that's really sweet.
But, you know what,

21:45.071 --> 21:47.006
I don't think I'm a good
match for social media.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.909
Maybe I should just quit
while I'm... way behind.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.211
Okay, suit yourself.
Thank you.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.846
(Speaking in Swedish)

21:53.880 --> 21:54.981
Uh, table for two?

21:55.014 --> 21:57.283
Oh, we're fully
booked tonight.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.317
Really?

21:58.351 --> 21:59.352
Sorry.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.153
Aw...

22:01.187 --> 22:02.922
Oh my god, it's you!

22:02.955 --> 22:04.090
Chairman of the Bored.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.726
(Laughing)

22:06.759 --> 22:07.827
You know what,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.696
I think we can find you
a table, okay?

22:09.729 --> 22:10.963
Daniel!
Daniel:
Yeah.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.799
Come here.
Look at this.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.701
You see who it is?
(Laughing)
Yeah.

22:14.734 --> 22:15.868
Please, do
your face again.

22:15.902 --> 22:16.903
(Laughing)

22:16.936 --> 22:20.006
* We're not living in America
