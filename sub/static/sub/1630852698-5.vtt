WEBVTT

00:33.324 --> 00:34.701
Stay away from us.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.120
Stay away!

00:37.704 --> 00:40.040
Shit. We won't go to heaven now.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.750
We're alive, so this is heaven.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.529
JUNG YONG-HYEON

01:21.831 --> 01:25.627
In some countries, they are sadder
when adults die than when children die.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.672
And in others,
they are sadder when children die.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.051
Which do you think our country is?

01:36.638 --> 01:37.680
What do you mean?

01:39.599 --> 01:42.727
When kids die, you lose hope.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.979
When adults die, you lose their wisdom.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.940
Hope and wisdom.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.567
Which do we value more?

01:52.737 --> 01:53.571
What?

01:58.368 --> 02:00.495
They've been flying around
since yesterday.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.082
If they wanted to save us,
they would have.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.421
But even if they do come,
we won't be the first to be rescued.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.093
We're not that important.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.349
We're just students. Nothing more.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.775
This is Chopper One.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.736
Seven survivors confirmed
at Hyosan City Council.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.414
RESCUE HEADQUARTERS

02:55.967 --> 02:59.304
We have everyone.
We're heading to the quarantine camp now.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.984
Around 11:00 a.m.,
the government announced

03:13.067 --> 03:14.444
they've declared martial law

03:14.527 --> 03:17.071
in order to control
the Hyosan Disturbance.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.992
Since yesterday afternoon,
a strange infection began to spread,

03:21.075 --> 03:22.619
leading to an evacuation order

03:22.702 --> 03:24.329
and a lockdown of the city.

03:24.996 --> 03:28.333
It's the first time in 41 years
that martial law has been declared,

03:28.416 --> 03:31.252
since the Democratization Movement
on May 18, 1980.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.005
I repeat. They have declared martial law

03:34.088 --> 03:36.341
in order to control
the Hyosan Disturbance.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.093
The sense of crisis
caused by the Hyosan acute epidemic

03:39.177 --> 03:41.596
has caused the stock market to crash.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.349
A sidecar that was activated
for both the KOSPI and KOSDAQ

03:44.432 --> 03:46.017
due to the crash caused by Covid-19…

03:46.100 --> 03:49.771
We don't want refugees from Hyosan!

03:49.854 --> 03:52.857
-We don't want them!
-We don't want them!

03:52.941 --> 03:56.486
People from Hyosan, return home right now!

03:56.569 --> 04:00.406
We are the Lord's people
who have received salvation.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.325
People will die as people,

04:02.408 --> 04:04.786
and demons will die as demons
in these end times.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.621
-Amen!
-Amen!

04:06.704 --> 04:09.040
Stay away!

04:13.586 --> 04:15.964
-Everyone will die!
-Everyone will die!

04:16.047 --> 04:17.131
What's this?

04:17.715 --> 04:19.092
-Wait.
-Everyone here will die!

04:19.175 --> 04:21.636
-Why won't you let us in?
-Damn it.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.013
-We refuse them!
-We refuse them!

04:24.097 --> 04:26.307
Don't come here! Why are you coming here?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.351
-Please help us!
-Go back!

04:28.434 --> 04:29.894
Go back!

04:32.105 --> 04:33.398
REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

04:34.857 --> 04:36.484
Our Lord Jesus Christ

04:36.567 --> 04:39.779
will not ask whether you are his son
or the son of the Devil.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.281
He will not.

04:44.158 --> 04:44.993
EVERYONE WILL DIE!

04:46.077 --> 04:47.704
Those who do not act righteously

04:47.787 --> 04:50.748
and those who do not love
their brothers and sisters…

04:51.791 --> 04:53.084
REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

04:53.167 --> 04:55.086
…are not people of God.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.170
-Amen!
-Amen!

04:56.254 --> 04:57.171
-Amen!
-Amen!

05:00.341 --> 05:02.427
We'll break a million views in no time.

05:09.767 --> 05:13.521
With a false rumor that
the Hyosan epidemic has spread to Seoul,

05:13.604 --> 05:16.524
the number of people leaving Korea
through Incheon Airport

05:16.607 --> 05:18.026
rose to 228,000 in a day.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.361
Hello. I apologize

05:20.445 --> 05:22.905
to the people and to the viewers
who were scared

05:22.989 --> 05:25.033
because of our zombie performance
on the subway.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.453
I am on my knees begging for forgiveness

05:29.287 --> 05:33.041
for unintentionally causing
a misunderstanding about the crisis…

05:33.124 --> 05:36.336
Is that what you expected? Really?

05:36.419 --> 05:40.631
SUBWAY ZOMBIE PERFORMANCE
APOLOGY VIDEO

05:41.424 --> 05:45.011
We must expand martial law
to control the media.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.555
There are rumors
that radiation from nuclear bombs

05:47.638 --> 05:49.390
in the US military base
created the zombies.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.268
That the heads of the top 30 corporations
fled the country.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.521
Most of the media are spreading fake news

05:55.605 --> 05:58.191
circulating on social media
without verifying it,

05:58.274 --> 06:00.026
exacerbating the chaos.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.403
The government
should not control the media.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.489
The people control the media.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.575
Our citizens have enough power to do that.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.952
We will not expand martial law.

06:10.745 --> 06:14.248
Let's focus on preventing the spread
and rescuing the uninfected.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.376
That should be our focus.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.045
-Su-hyeok.
-Hey, Bare-su.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.089
Are you okay?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.257
-Where's the phone?
-Where's Cheong-san?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.227
Su-hyeok.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.398
Where's Cheong-san?

06:43.194 --> 06:45.279
We got separated in the teachers' office.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.698
He'll be fine.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.618
You got separated? Fuck.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.791
I'm sorry… for coming back alone.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.097
Come here.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.573
Were you bit? You were bit, right?

07:28.656 --> 07:29.949
No, I--

08:30.259 --> 08:31.135
Stop it.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.596
Give me the phone.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.264
You killed a person, you murderer.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.974
You made me kill him.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.603
-You said to prove I wasn't a loser.
-You crazy bastard.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.131
Let go!

09:20.268 --> 09:21.352
Do you want to live?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.062
Do you?

09:26.232 --> 09:27.692
Beg for your life.

09:27.775 --> 09:28.776
Screw you.

10:12.945 --> 10:13.779
Fuck!

10:14.488 --> 10:15.823
Help me, fuck!

10:17.158 --> 10:19.285
Cheong-san!

10:19.368 --> 10:20.244
Fuck!

10:21.662 --> 10:22.872
Please!

10:24.665 --> 10:25.583
Cheong-san!

10:40.348 --> 10:41.265
I'll kill you.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.684
I will kill you.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.269
I'll kill you.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.438
I'll…

10:48.272 --> 10:49.315
I'll kill you.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.930
Shit.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.058
There's not a single normal one.
They're all zombies.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.100
Hey! In front of you!

13:30.768 --> 13:32.728
Fuck. Shoot it already!

13:37.483 --> 13:39.652
We're going to die
before we find your brother.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.575
Let's go, Ha-ri.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.631
Seriously--

14:26.866 --> 14:27.741
Damn it.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.373
I told you we should have stayed put.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.417
It's crazy to think
we can find her brother.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.502
And just as crazy to have followed her.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.503
-I told you--
-Ha-ri!

14:39.587 --> 14:41.005
-What?
-There's a computer.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.381
Turn it on.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.925
Post on Instagram or Facebook for help.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.677
Shit.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.492
Martial Law Command has acted swiftly

15:11.076 --> 15:13.954
and thoroughly sealed off Hyosan

15:14.705 --> 15:19.668
to prevent the situation
from spreading to other areas.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.422
If you live outside
of the area under martial law,

15:23.505 --> 15:26.008
please go on with your lives.

15:26.675 --> 15:30.304
Martial Law Command is doing its best
to confirm and quarantine those infected

15:30.387 --> 15:34.725
and to rescue and protect

15:35.643 --> 15:37.353
those who are not infected.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.354
EMERGENCY CALL

15:38.437 --> 15:42.399
Every operation is being performed
in strict compliance with the laws

15:43.233 --> 15:44.401
and principles in place.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.903
EMERGENCY CALL
CONNECTING

15:46.570 --> 15:50.324
Fake news about the Hyosan epidemic

15:50.407 --> 15:53.494
is spreading uncontrollably.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.956
Martial Law Command will block

15:57.706 --> 16:01.710
all unconfirmed rumors,
and at the same time,

16:02.503 --> 16:04.713
in the interest of improving
the efficiency of operations,

16:05.214 --> 16:06.548
from this moment on,

16:07.299 --> 16:10.010
all communication from Hyosan,
including all cell phone services,

16:10.094 --> 16:14.515
landline services, and Internet services
in Hyosan will be terminated

16:14.598 --> 16:15.808
from this moment on.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.362
-The cable's connected. Why won't it work?
-I keep refreshing, but…

16:28.445 --> 16:29.738
-Try the phone.
-Okay.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.372
Fuck. Assholes.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.750
They cut off our phones and Internet.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.921
We at Martial Law Command
are doing our best

16:46.005 --> 16:48.173
to suppress the spread.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.344
Moreover, we are focusing
all of our resources

16:53.053 --> 16:55.389
on rescuing the people who are trapped.

16:56.432 --> 17:00.102
If you live in Hyosan
and are watching this now,

17:00.853 --> 17:05.024
please have hope and wait to be rescued.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.233
NO SIGNAL

17:06.316 --> 17:08.277
OCTOBER 21, THURSDAY

18:03.123 --> 18:05.209
WATER FLOW DETECTOR

18:11.673 --> 18:15.260
What do we do?
On-jo and Cheong-san are really close.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.720
They're going out.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.972
On-jo says they're not.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.475
I'm telling you they are.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.811
They're always together.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.189
Really?

18:27.815 --> 18:29.358
NAM ON-JO

18:29.441 --> 18:30.984
Poor On-jo.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.043
I'm sure Cheong-san is fine.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.338
You know how fast he is.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.675
He never listens to me.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.595
He's never done as I said
ever since we were kids.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.518
I told him not to go, but he insisted.

19:05.978 --> 19:06.895
I'm sorry.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.607
I should've brought him back.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.698
Where do you think…

19:21.160 --> 19:22.244
he is?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.790
I'm sure he's hiding somewhere safe.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.639
Joon-yeong. Didn't you say
your science club made drones?

19:43.599 --> 19:46.143
You want to look for Cheong-san
using a drone?

19:46.226 --> 19:49.605
-Can't we?
-We can, but it's in the science lab.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.898
We can go get it.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.401
How can we get there?
It's full of zombies out there.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.029
That.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.326
You want me to climb up using that?

20:02.409 --> 20:05.204
The science lab
is filled with zombies too.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.165
There weren't any
in the supply room. Right?

20:08.790 --> 20:09.791
That's true, but…

20:13.420 --> 20:15.380
We have to find Cheong-san.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.383
Right now, we only have

20:19.092 --> 20:20.302
each other.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.478
Yes. It would be good if we had a drone.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.689
We can find Cheong-san
and see how things are outside.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.735
We may even be able
to send a message asking for help.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.030
That's all good, but

20:41.657 --> 20:43.575
who will go?

20:43.659 --> 20:44.868
I'll go.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.497
I've had fire department training,
and I've climbed ropes before.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.624
No, I'll go.

20:52.793 --> 20:56.713
You went to the teachers' office already.
You can't keep putting yourself in danger.

20:57.381 --> 21:01.134
The drone wasn't completed,
so we need a few more parts.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.470
Do you know what to get?

21:08.392 --> 21:09.810
I have to go anyway.

21:11.937 --> 21:12.980
I'll go with On-jo.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.064
No.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.569
I'll really go this time.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.113
You can't go.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.365
Not with that body.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.075
The rope will snap.

21:25.158 --> 21:28.787
It was fine when I came down.
But it'll snap if I climb up, right?

21:29.496 --> 21:31.623
-Right.
-It'll snap.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.708
Right. Good boy.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.169
Joon-yeong, let's go together.

21:40.966 --> 21:41.967
It's too dangerous.

21:43.051 --> 21:43.927
I'll go.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.479
Thanks.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.398
But I don't want you

21:58.066 --> 21:59.359
to be in danger either.

22:02.612 --> 22:03.530
I'm going.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.581
I'm going.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.894
Be careful, On-jo.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.315
Come back safely.
I'll be watching from here.

22:59.753 --> 23:00.712
Do you think

23:01.630 --> 23:03.840
everything's all right out there?

23:04.424 --> 23:05.467
I'm sure it is.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.971
As you said,
the soldiers and the police are there.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.978
I want to go to my dad's factory
and my mom's sundae restaurant.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.273
Whatever.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.734
You hate the smell of leather and sundae.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.404
I just do.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.115
I suddenly want my mom's sundae soup.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.038
Did you finally grow up?
You should've been like that sooner.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.376
It's too late.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.135
Hey, look.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.221
I bet there's a key in there, right?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.933
I don't think so.

23:57.102 --> 24:00.021
Wouldn't it be better to hide
somewhere safe and wait to be rescued?

24:00.605 --> 24:03.275
Hey.
He said the solution is in his laptop.

24:03.358 --> 24:06.236
We need to hurry and notify
Disaster and Safety Management.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.906
The people with important information
need to survive.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.700
So doesn't our survival come first?

24:11.783 --> 24:15.120
Why do you keep acting
like a leader of society?

24:15.203 --> 24:16.872
Did you go to Seoul University
or something?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.500
-Yes.
-What? Why?

24:21.168 --> 24:22.210
You really went there?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.671
No, I haven't graduated yet.
I have to go back.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.465
I see. Grad school?

24:26.548 --> 24:28.467
-No. I'm a sophomore.
-What?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.511
Did you retake your exams?
Four times? Five?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.472
I see. Six times.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.682
I went straight after high school.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.604
My goodness. You must've studied hard.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.481
Your face says it all.

24:43.773 --> 24:47.152
Hey. You're smart,
so I'll only say this once.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.237
Be quiet and follow me.

24:49.905 --> 24:50.864
Wait.

24:51.865 --> 24:52.699
Damn it!

25:01.541 --> 25:02.792
Shut the door!

25:03.668 --> 25:04.503
Damn it.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.632
Why won't it start?

25:11.218 --> 25:12.302
Hurry!

25:12.385 --> 25:13.553
Please help me!

25:14.262 --> 25:15.931
-This way!
-Stay away!

25:16.014 --> 25:17.265
Get him off me!

25:18.558 --> 25:20.268
-Come here!
-Yes, sir.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.353
Hurry!

25:21.436 --> 25:25.148
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW BUSINESS

25:26.691 --> 25:28.360
Shit! Oh my God!

25:29.277 --> 25:31.071
It's a zombie, sir.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.697
There's a zombie inside.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.665
-There's one inside?
-Yes.

25:43.083 --> 25:43.917
Damn it.

25:49.381 --> 25:55.136
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

25:55.220 --> 25:56.221
It's okay. Come in.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.099
Damn it.

25:59.849 --> 26:00.684
Really?

26:01.601 --> 26:03.353
It's okay. She's tied up.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.650
A student should be in school.
Why is she in a chicken place…

26:09.150 --> 26:09.985
Why is she tied--

26:10.068 --> 26:11.027
Oh my God!

26:12.195 --> 26:13.488
What? What is it this time?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.115
Look. Over there.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.369
What? What is that?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.457
Shit.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.172
Is it okay?

26:31.923 --> 26:33.383
Is the baby a zombie?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.471
No. It's alive.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.120
Check the fridge
for some milk or something.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.747
Why? Are you thirsty?

27:05.707 --> 27:06.541
For the baby.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.504
We need to feed the baby.
It looks exhausted.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.924
What if there's no milk?

27:15.550 --> 27:17.802
Just check the fridge first.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.513
We can think about what to do
if there isn't any.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.432
Oh. You're right.

27:24.017 --> 27:27.270
-If there's no milk, what should I bring?
-Just check first.

27:28.521 --> 27:29.648
Before I beat you up.

27:36.905 --> 27:37.947
What do we do now?

27:41.451 --> 27:44.371
What else? We have to go to headquarters.

27:46.373 --> 27:47.457
What about the baby?

27:48.750 --> 27:50.460
It's hard enough with just us.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.920
Are you going to take it?

28:08.895 --> 28:09.896
Careful.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.857
-The drone and the bag are there.
-Okay.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.864
Hang on. Where was it?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.409
Where is the battery?

28:39.926 --> 28:42.011
Have you thought about that?

28:42.846 --> 28:43.930
About what?

28:48.393 --> 28:52.188
What if everyone turned
and we're the only humans left?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.150
No way.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.694
What if that were true?

28:59.279 --> 29:00.155
Come on.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.616
That means we're the minority.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.579
Minorities always go extinct.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.792
I'm sure we're not.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.920
But what if we are?

29:17.839 --> 29:19.466
Can you endure this?

29:24.053 --> 29:25.054
I don't know.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.017
But I don't want to become a zombie.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.436
They don't recognize anyone.

29:32.103 --> 29:32.979
Then…

29:35.940 --> 29:37.317
I won't recognize you either.

29:46.826 --> 29:49.162
I have a favor if I do get bit.

29:50.955 --> 29:51.831
No.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.209
Don't get bit.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.337
-If by chance--
-No.

29:58.421 --> 29:59.714
Don't get bit. You can't.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.967
Don't even think about it.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.305
THIS DOOR DOES NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE

30:07.388 --> 30:09.098
Damn it.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.660
-Eat up, I-sak.
-Thank you.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.538
On-jo. Which do you like better?

31:14.622 --> 31:17.125
-They both taste good.
-They do?

31:26.426 --> 31:27.969
Is this better

31:29.220 --> 31:30.430
or is this better?

31:39.647 --> 31:40.732
Why?

32:05.715 --> 32:06.883
Fuck this.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.364
MUSIC ROOM

32:35.912 --> 32:36.913
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

32:43.002 --> 32:44.087
Be careful, On-jo.

32:44.796 --> 32:45.880
Take your time.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.925
Hurry up. Hurry.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.314
HELP, WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM
IN HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

33:11.990 --> 33:12.907
Does it work?

33:13.574 --> 33:14.450
Is it working?

33:14.534 --> 33:15.743
I think it will.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.595
You scared me! That's mad fast.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.473
I'll take it outside
after I find Cheong-san.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.892
If I find rescuers outside,
I'll land it in front of them.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.564
Wait.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.401
They say when people confirm
their situation is hopeless,

33:49.610 --> 33:51.446
they truly fall into despair.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.076
That's a cool saying.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.162
But what does that mean?

34:03.708 --> 34:06.627
Even if the entire world
has turned into zombies,

34:07.670 --> 34:09.380
let's not despair.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.924
I see. So that's what it means?

34:14.385 --> 34:15.470
Prez.

34:16.095 --> 34:18.556
It's best to have a plan
and act accordingly,

34:19.432 --> 34:22.018
but we're not top students
or as smart as you.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.521
Being logical
isn't necessarily being human.

34:26.105 --> 34:27.940
We should be logical in crisis situations.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.609
Right now,

34:31.444 --> 34:33.029
we need hope more than logic.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.201
Hey. I think

34:38.910 --> 34:40.953
flying that is
what we need most right now.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.458
-Try it.
-Here I go.

34:45.541 --> 34:46.501
Okay.

35:10.733 --> 35:11.776
Oh no.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.112
Everyone's turned.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.705
I wouldn't have studied
if I knew this was going to happen.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.374
I can't take the CSAT anyway.

35:26.874 --> 35:29.418
Fuck. I'm never studying again.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.421
Can you please be serious
in serious situations?

35:32.505 --> 35:34.298
I'm very serious right now.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.469
What will you do?
Will you keep looking for your brother?

35:40.805 --> 35:42.807
The archery training center
has an emergency phone.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.976
It connects to 911 automatically.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.269
-Really?
-Yes.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.729
We got it installed
in case there were accidents.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.858
What if it doesn't connect?
The phone and Internet are dead.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.067
It doesn't matter.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.696
That's where all the arrows are anyway.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.741
I have less than 20 left. We need more
if we want to leave the school.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.119
-I think--
-Okay, let's go.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.997
Let's go to your training center
and get your arrows.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.250
Then let's go home or to a supermarket.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.003
You know, in zombie movies,

36:12.086 --> 36:14.505
the ones that go to supermarkets
always live the best.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.133
They have cigarettes too.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.259
I think--

36:18.342 --> 36:20.261
The dumpsters are below these windows.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.639
I think we should jump down
rather than use the stairs.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.475
Okay. Let's jump.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.897
Falling from the third floor won't hurt
as much as failing to get into college.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.940
Let me get a word in!

36:33.024 --> 36:36.319
Min-jae. Go down first
and shoot any that come running.

36:36.402 --> 36:37.528
Okay.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.739
Then you two go down and help him.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.991
I'll cover you in the hallway and go last.

36:43.993 --> 36:47.079
-What did you want to say?
-Let's just stay here.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.041
The adults will come to rescue us.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.293
You can stay if you want.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.463
But I don't trust adults.

36:59.926 --> 37:03.137
Damn. That bitch is so my type.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.972
I'm too scared to be alone.

37:06.265 --> 37:07.225
Hurry up.

37:37.463 --> 37:38.839
Look out! Behind you!

37:39.840 --> 37:40.967
Move.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.725
Damn.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.185
Why is this so high? Fuck!

37:52.937 --> 37:53.980
Jump already.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.481
Damn. Okay, I'm going.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.070
Whoa. Fuck!

38:18.671 --> 38:20.339
There's no one in the infirmary.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.383
Joon-yeong, go somewhere else.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.139
Wait. Hold on.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.266
Isn't that an arrow?

38:30.349 --> 38:31.767
-Where?
-This.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.186
You're right. It is an arrow.

38:34.687 --> 38:35.646
Why?

38:37.648 --> 38:38.566
My sister.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.153
She had a competition today.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.257
Where the hell is Cheong-san?

39:41.796 --> 39:42.713
It's Cheong-san!

39:43.381 --> 39:45.216
-What room is that?
-Cheong-san!

39:45.299 --> 39:46.342
He can't hear you.

39:46.967 --> 39:47.885
Be quiet.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.679
-Hey, Cheong-san!
-I said he can't hear you.

39:50.763 --> 39:51.972
On-jo, it's all right now.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.308
Cheong-san's alive!

39:54.392 --> 39:55.226
He's alive!

40:06.779 --> 40:08.864
What's he doing? Where's he going?

40:09.573 --> 40:10.866
Look this way! Over here!

40:10.950 --> 40:12.952
Where are you going, moron?

40:13.035 --> 40:14.161
He can't hear you!

40:14.245 --> 40:17.206
Be quiet, will you? You're so damn loud.
You could get us killed.

40:17.289 --> 40:18.457
My bad.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.586
Didn't you say the battery was low?

40:22.670 --> 40:25.172
Yes. I couldn't fully charge it,
so there isn't much juice left.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.717
Since we confirmed where Cheong-san is,
let's look elsewhere.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.345
We wanted to check outside
and ask for help too.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.974
On-jo, is that okay?

40:35.975 --> 40:38.477
Yes, since we saw that he's alive.

40:39.061 --> 40:39.937
Here we go.

40:48.863 --> 40:49.697
Damn.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.574
Fuck. It's Zombieland out there.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.536
I think we should look
outside of the school.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.122
Let's go outside.

40:58.789 --> 40:59.665
Okay.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.263
Wait.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.182
What is it?

41:16.265 --> 41:17.433
Wait.

41:18.726 --> 41:19.602
Wait.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.240
What's wrong, Ji-min?

41:33.324 --> 41:34.325
Wait.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.912
I can't…

41:41.874 --> 41:43.334
What is it?

41:47.421 --> 41:48.589
This…

41:51.550 --> 41:53.344
this is my dad's car.

41:56.096 --> 41:57.014
Which one?

41:57.723 --> 42:00.100
The white one? The black one?

42:00.851 --> 42:02.061
This truck.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.605
It's my dad's.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.027
Don't worry.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.780
I'm sure there are lots of cars like that.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.492
Let me check.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.524
Ji-min.

43:19.138 --> 43:22.558
11:47 AM
ABANDONED PRISON IN THE SUBURB OF HYOSAN

44:02.014 --> 44:06.185
This announcement is for the citizens
of Hyosan who are in quarantine.

44:06.268 --> 44:10.814
Please abide by the quarantine rules
and keep order…

44:10.898 --> 44:13.359
-Don't you see us in line?
-…under the control of the military.

44:13.442 --> 44:14.276
What about us?

44:14.360 --> 44:18.697
Please cooperate with the tests
to determine if you are infected…

44:18.781 --> 44:20.407
Who are they to get special treatment?

44:20.491 --> 44:23.786
…and follow the rules
of living in this facility.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.121
I repeat.

44:27.456 --> 44:32.002
Please abide by the quarantine rules

44:32.086 --> 44:35.506
and keep order
under the control of the military.

44:35.589 --> 44:40.177
Please cooperate with the tests
to determine if you are infected

44:40.761 --> 44:44.098
and follow the rules
of living in this facility.

44:45.474 --> 44:46.433
EXAMINATION ROOM

44:47.351 --> 44:48.602
Thank you for your service.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.562
Where's the control room?

44:55.150 --> 44:56.193
As per martial law,

44:56.276 --> 44:58.987
you will be quarantined
until you are examined.

44:59.071 --> 45:02.741
Why must she quarantine?
She just returned from a battlefield.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.702
It's okay. That's enough.

45:05.994 --> 45:07.538
Where is the control room?

45:07.621 --> 45:09.665
You will be examined first.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.917
I'm not refusing to be examined.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.919
Please follow the rules.

45:14.503 --> 45:17.005
I'm Capt. Nam So-ju
of Rescue Team One at Hyosan Fire Station.

45:17.506 --> 45:19.633
I was responsible for their rescue--

45:19.717 --> 45:20.718
Hey!

45:21.218 --> 45:23.679
Does it sound like I'm asking?

45:24.471 --> 45:26.765
-Take them to the examination room.
-Yes, sir.

45:41.655 --> 45:42.489
What is this place?

45:43.991 --> 45:45.492
This isn't an examination room.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.620
There are too many awaiting examination,
so you must wait.

45:48.704 --> 45:52.332
Then you should've explained
the situation and asked her to wait

45:52.416 --> 45:54.710
and then escorted her.
What is wrong with you?

45:55.461 --> 46:00.090
Others are sitting on mats
on a concrete floor.

46:00.841 --> 46:04.344
We're offering the best we can
since you are an assembly member.

46:05.929 --> 46:09.224
The wait time
for an examination is 12 to 72 hours.

46:09.933 --> 46:10.851
Wait.

46:12.436 --> 46:13.979
My daughter is at her school.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.523
It may be too late if we delay any longer.

46:17.691 --> 46:19.234
Please rescue them.

46:20.110 --> 46:22.196
We're doing the best we can.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.323
Wait here.

47:21.129 --> 47:22.923
Fuck.

47:24.466 --> 47:25.634
Did I die?

47:28.220 --> 47:29.805
Am I fucking dead?

47:50.868 --> 47:51.869
Hey.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.462
Aren't you going to eat me,
you zombie bastards?

48:06.550 --> 48:10.012
I gave them serotonin injections
for a week, but it had no effect.

48:11.346 --> 48:13.849
The Jonas Virus evolves
as soon as it detects antibodies

48:13.932 --> 48:16.810
so the antibodies lose their target.

48:17.352 --> 48:20.272
The only explanation is
that the virus learns and evolves.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.068
If this virus

48:26.737 --> 48:28.947
manages to learn the human mind…

48:40.667 --> 48:42.794
a new breed of human may be born.

48:51.845 --> 48:54.097
Cheong-san, you son of a bitch.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.600
I'll kill you.

49:45.023 --> 49:46.316
What the hell?

49:51.613 --> 49:52.739
This means…

49:55.701 --> 49:58.495
ONE HEART

49:58.578 --> 49:59.788
…I'm in heaven.

50:07.546 --> 50:09.506
Hey, Cheong-san!

54:07.702 --> 54:10.163
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

54:10.247 --> 54:11.998
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
