03:17.490 --> 03:21.120
<i>It's me, Peter Parker.</i>
<i>Your friendly neighborhood...</i>

03:21.245 --> 03:22.246
<i>... you know.</i>

03:22.371 --> 03:25.498
<i>I've come a long way from being</i>
<i>the boy who was bit by a spider.</i>

03:25.582 --> 03:28.502
<i>Back then, nothing seemed</i>
<i>to go right for me. Now...</i>

03:28.627 --> 03:30.087
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

03:30.170 --> 03:31.839
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

03:31.964 --> 03:34.049
<i>... people really like me.</i>

03:34.258 --> 03:36.969
Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

03:37.094 --> 03:39.763
That's okay.

03:40.931 --> 03:42.683
<i>The city is safe and sound.</i>

03:42.808 --> 03:44.768
<i>I guess I've had something</i>
<i>to do with that.</i>

03:44.893 --> 03:46.770
<i>My Uncle Ben would be proud.</i>

03:52.609 --> 03:54.695
<i>I still get to school. Top of my class.</i>

03:54.778 --> 03:56.655
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us...

03:56.864 --> 04:01.243
...that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.

04:03.662 --> 04:08.250
From the form of this matrix,
we can see?

04:08.250 --> 04:10.335
Miss Stacy?

04:10.461 --> 04:13.756
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

04:13.797 --> 04:17.009
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

04:20.887 --> 04:24.391
Parker? You got something to add?

04:25.142 --> 04:26.894
No, sir.

04:29.229 --> 04:33.484
<i>And I'm in love</i>
<i>with the girl of my dreams.</i>

04:48.290 --> 04:50.250
Hi.

04:50.375 --> 04:54.963
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

04:55.798 --> 04:57.341
Excuse me. Sorry.

04:57.466 --> 04:59.968
Thank you. Sorry.

05:05.599 --> 05:08.394
I'm so nervous.

05:32.209 --> 05:34.461
That's my girlfriend.

06:48.535 --> 06:51.121
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

06:52.581 --> 06:53.832
Harry?

06:54.041 --> 06:55.501
Harry!

06:55.626 --> 06:57.669
I need to talk to you.

06:58.212 --> 06:59.963
Explain things.

07:01.965 --> 07:05.719
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

07:07.388 --> 07:11.225
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

07:20.317 --> 07:21.235
M. J!

07:21.485 --> 07:23.737
- Peter!
- Congrats!

07:23.862 --> 07:26.240
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

07:26.365 --> 07:28.742
- You were...
- You said great.

07:28.867 --> 07:32.496
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

07:32.621 --> 07:36.583
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

07:36.667 --> 07:39.920
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

07:40.003 --> 07:42.089
Tell me again. Was I really good?

07:42.214 --> 07:44.591
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

07:44.717 --> 07:47.302
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

07:47.428 --> 07:49.304
Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.

07:49.513 --> 07:52.725
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

07:52.850 --> 07:55.769
When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...

07:55.769 --> 07:57.855
You are such a nerd.

08:50.616 --> 08:52.493
Did you see that one?

09:01.752 --> 09:03.545
You know what?

09:05.089 --> 09:08.634
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

09:08.675 --> 09:11.136
...with you in the first row.

09:12.429 --> 09:14.390
I'll be there.

09:16.266 --> 09:18.560
Tell me you love me.

09:20.646 --> 09:22.731
I love you.

09:23.023 --> 09:25.317
I love you so much.

09:26.610 --> 09:28.153
I always have.

10:15.909 --> 10:17.369
- Ready?
- Yep.

12:13.026 --> 12:15.404
You can't hide here, Flint.

12:15.821 --> 12:19.992
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

12:20.117 --> 12:23.954
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

12:24.288 --> 12:27.583
You're nothing but a common thief.

12:27.708 --> 12:31.253
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

12:31.962 --> 12:33.756
It wasn't.

12:33.881 --> 12:36.050
I had good reason
for what I was doing.

12:36.133 --> 12:37.384
And that's the truth.

12:37.634 --> 12:41.972
You and the truth <i>, s</i> itting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

12:41.972 --> 12:44.600
I live in the presence of great truth...

12:44.600 --> 12:47.102
...and that is the truth
that you left behind...

12:47.227 --> 12:50.105
...right there in that bedroom.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.912
Penny.

13:05.871 --> 13:07.539
I missed you.

13:08.791 --> 13:11.377
I miss you too, Daddy.

13:22.262 --> 13:25.891
I promise I'll make you healthy again.

13:26.016 --> 13:29.019
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

13:29.019 --> 13:32.356
You get out of here. Now.

13:43.409 --> 13:45.494
I'm not a bad person.

13:47.287 --> 13:49.456
Just had bad luck.

14:07.307 --> 14:08.934
Peter, what is it?

14:10.811 --> 14:12.479
It's M. J.

14:13.313 --> 14:16.859
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

14:18.861 --> 14:23.741
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

14:23.741 --> 14:25.617
And excited.

14:25.743 --> 14:27.494
And very young.

14:27.619 --> 14:30.748
And I loved him so fiercely.

14:30.748 --> 14:32.833
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

14:33.042 --> 14:35.419
I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

14:35.544 --> 14:38.338
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

14:38.464 --> 14:40.841
So we took our time.

14:40.966 --> 14:43.469
Looked forward to it.

14:43.594 --> 14:47.222
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

14:48.599 --> 14:51.477
A man has to be understanding...

14:51.602 --> 14:54.730
...and put his wife before himself.

14:55.439 --> 14:57.941
Can you do that, Peter?

14:59.526 --> 15:02.321
Yeah, I think I can.

15:02.446 --> 15:05.866
Then you have my blessing.

15:07.951 --> 15:11.080
I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

15:11.205 --> 15:14.541
Your uncle had it all planned.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.627
He took me to the beach
one Sunday.

15:16.710 --> 15:19.630
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

15:19.755 --> 15:22.341
And I didn't look too bad myself.

15:22.466 --> 15:24.426
We were very good swimmers.

15:24.551 --> 15:27.137
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

15:27.262 --> 15:29.223
"Let's swim to the island."

15:29.348 --> 15:34.978
And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree...

15:34.978 --> 15:38.607
...and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

15:38.649 --> 15:42.069
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

15:42.152 --> 15:44.988
And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."

15:44.988 --> 15:46.865
And I did.

15:47.074 --> 15:49.993
And he was holding this ring.

15:51.245 --> 15:52.704
Dazzling...

15:52.830 --> 15:54.581
...in front of me.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.461
I thought it was the sun.

16:01.755 --> 16:04.675
We'd be married 50 years...

16:05.509 --> 16:08.429
...come August if...

16:15.018 --> 16:16.478
So...

16:18.021 --> 16:23.569
...I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.

16:24.194 --> 16:27.322
Do something she'll never forget.

16:30.242 --> 16:31.910
Give her this.

16:33.704 --> 16:36.373
Go on. Take it.

17:53.534 --> 17:56.036
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

17:59.623 --> 18:02.209
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

18:04.086 --> 18:06.046
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.

18:06.171 --> 18:07.923
Shut up!

19:49.900 --> 19:52.319
I'm still here, Peter.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.387
Hate those things.

21:16.987 --> 21:18.655
Harry?

21:22.493 --> 21:23.952
Harry.

21:24.912 --> 21:26.455
Harry.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.253
Oh, my God.

21:39.510 --> 21:41.470
Harry!

21:43.347 --> 21:45.224
Come on!

21:47.935 --> 21:49.603
God.

21:53.190 --> 21:54.525
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.402
And clear.

21:56.610 --> 21:57.861
No response.

21:57.945 --> 21:59.738
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

21:59.863 --> 22:02.324
- Charging.
- And clear.

22:02.449 --> 22:03.492
No response.

22:03.617 --> 22:06.912
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

22:12.543 --> 22:14.128
Captain Stacy.

22:14.837 --> 22:16.088
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

22:16.296 --> 22:18.382
The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.

22:18.507 --> 22:20.384
- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.

22:20.592 --> 22:21.844
- And?
- He's on the run.

22:22.052 --> 22:24.221
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

22:28.517 --> 22:30.185
There he is.

22:48.829 --> 22:51.874
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

22:56.170 --> 22:57.921
Where did he go?

23:19.943 --> 23:21.570
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

23:21.695 --> 23:23.781
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation
on one.

23:23.989 --> 23:27.743
- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.

23:27.868 --> 23:29.703
Initiating demolecularization.

24:59.626 --> 25:01.670
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

25:01.795 --> 25:04.298
But there's been
some memory impairment.

25:04.381 --> 25:06.050
Particularly his short-term memory.

25:06.175 --> 25:08.260
Right now he can't
remember the accident...

25:08.469 --> 25:10.637
...or anything that happened
to him recently.

25:10.763 --> 25:12.014
Is it permanent?

25:12.139 --> 25:15.225
It could be. Only time will tell.

25:15.559 --> 25:17.853
He's awake if you wanna see him.

25:17.978 --> 25:19.313
Maybe I should wait.

25:19.396 --> 25:22.858
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

25:41.919 --> 25:43.170
Hey, buddy.

25:43.837 --> 25:45.255
Hey.

25:46.006 --> 25:47.549
Hit my head.

25:47.674 --> 25:49.218
Yeah.

25:49.551 --> 25:51.845
Doctor said I was in an accident.

25:51.929 --> 25:53.097
Hit-and-run.

25:53.722 --> 25:56.308
I don't remember much of anything.

25:57.768 --> 25:59.436
My father...

25:59.978 --> 26:01.647
...he died, right?

26:03.857 --> 26:06.318
This is all so weird.

26:07.486 --> 26:11.115
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.282
I know that face.

26:12.699 --> 26:13.826
How you doing?

26:14.159 --> 26:15.619
I don't know.

26:15.703 --> 26:17.788
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

26:18.038 --> 26:19.164
Somewhere.

26:19.790 --> 26:21.041
You're still fine.

26:22.626 --> 26:24.461
We love you, Harry.

26:25.129 --> 26:27.172
It feels like...

26:28.048 --> 26:31.552
...somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

26:33.053 --> 26:34.805
And now I'm back home.

26:35.431 --> 26:37.599
It's good to have you back.

26:38.559 --> 26:41.687
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?

26:41.812 --> 26:44.189
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

26:44.314 --> 26:46.275
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.444
Yeah. Great.

26:49.194 --> 26:50.738
Get some sleep.

26:54.324 --> 26:56.785
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

26:56.910 --> 26:59.621
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.418
You have lovely friends.

27:04.501 --> 27:06.712
My best friends.

27:09.339 --> 27:11.508
I'd give my life for them.

30:21.073 --> 30:23.367
- Yeah?
- It's me.

30:24.201 --> 30:25.661
Hey.

30:25.953 --> 30:28.163
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

30:28.372 --> 30:29.832
It's stuck again?

30:30.374 --> 30:32.418
Just come on and help me.

30:32.543 --> 30:34.211
I'm coming.

30:40.259 --> 30:42.428
- Hey.
- The review.

30:43.303 --> 30:46.390
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

30:46.515 --> 30:48.892
"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl...

30:49.017 --> 30:51.186
...easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

30:51.311 --> 30:53.605
Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."

30:53.731 --> 30:55.899
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

30:55.983 --> 30:57.568
You were in the first row.

30:57.776 --> 31:01.113
Yeah, this... Listen, you were great.

31:01.530 --> 31:05.784
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

31:05.826 --> 31:09.455
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

31:09.580 --> 31:13.625
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

31:13.751 --> 31:17.254
I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.

31:17.379 --> 31:20.090
You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.

31:20.174 --> 31:21.967
You get right back
on the horse and...

31:22.176 --> 31:24.053
Don't give me the horse thing.

31:24.178 --> 31:26.638
Try and understand how I feel.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.228
It's just...

31:36.148 --> 31:38.233
...I look at these words...

31:39.193 --> 31:41.570
...and it's like my father wrote them.

31:42.613 --> 31:46.992
<i>All cars. All cars in the vicinity of</i>
<i>54th and Sixth Avenue, please report.</i>

31:46.992 --> 31:49.703
<i>Crane out of control,</i>
<i>approach with caution.</i>

31:52.956 --> 31:54.708
"Go get them, tiger"?

31:56.877 --> 31:58.545
I'm sorry.

32:31.620 --> 32:34.123
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

32:34.248 --> 32:37.126
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

32:37.251 --> 32:40.587
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

32:46.510 --> 32:50.389
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

32:53.726 --> 32:57.146
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

33:00.190 --> 33:03.110
What is that thing
doing in my background?

33:28.761 --> 33:31.472
They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.

33:31.555 --> 33:34.475
Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.

33:38.145 --> 33:39.188
Are you all right?

33:39.396 --> 33:41.065
It's coming back.

33:43.150 --> 33:44.193
Oh, no.

34:07.966 --> 34:10.886
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

34:16.016 --> 34:17.434
What's she doing up there?

34:17.559 --> 34:20.478
I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

34:20.478 --> 34:23.607
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

34:23.690 --> 34:25.484
<i>And I work at the Daily Bugle</i>.

34:26.193 --> 34:28.612
And I'm dating your daughter.

35:23.876 --> 35:25.210
You okay?

35:25.335 --> 35:27.838
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:28.047 --> 35:29.089
Thank you.

35:29.173 --> 35:31.592
<i>Hey, Spidey, hold on.</i>
<i>Bugle needs a photo.</i>

35:31.675 --> 35:33.552
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.

35:33.677 --> 35:35.637
Hey. I'm the new guy.

35:35.763 --> 35:37.014
New guy?

35:38.599 --> 35:39.600
You okay?

35:39.725 --> 35:42.853
<i>From now on, I am gonna be</i>
<i>taking shots of you for the Bugle.</i>

35:42.853 --> 35:45.773
So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.

35:45.856 --> 35:48.358
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

35:48.776 --> 35:53.072
Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.

35:53.072 --> 35:55.866
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

35:55.991 --> 35:58.369
Just... Yeah, a little chunky.

35:58.702 --> 36:00.371
Okay.

36:00.996 --> 36:03.499
But you don't have to worry about that
anymore, buddy.

36:12.341 --> 36:13.300
Dazzle me.

36:21.016 --> 36:24.019
Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

36:24.144 --> 36:27.064
<i>As you know, circulation at the Bugle's</i>
<i>been pretty good.</i>

36:27.064 --> 36:29.024
<i>Though not as good</i>
<i>as The New York Times.</i>

36:29.149 --> 36:32.069
<i>Or the Daily News, or the Post,</i>
<i>or several other smaller...</i>

36:32.069 --> 36:34.154
Get on with it, you moron...!

36:34.363 --> 36:36.240
- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.

36:36.323 --> 36:39.660
- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

36:43.122 --> 36:44.998
Thank you.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.878
So I propose this campaign.

36:50.129 --> 36:52.589
'<i>'Daily Bugle. " That's obvious.</i>

36:52.715 --> 36:55.926
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

36:56.677 --> 36:59.471
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

36:59.596 --> 37:01.890
We gave him a couple lattes,
it's like:

37:02.182 --> 37:05.102
"And how." That's me again.

37:05.519 --> 37:07.312
Time to take your pill.

37:08.564 --> 37:10.232
Not that one.

37:10.983 --> 37:12.735
Not that one.

37:20.868 --> 37:23.245
Drink plenty of water.

37:27.124 --> 37:28.584
Thank you.

37:30.961 --> 37:31.920
Continue.

37:35.466 --> 37:38.177
- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.

37:38.302 --> 37:39.845
What's that smell?

37:39.928 --> 37:43.390
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

37:43.474 --> 37:45.142
It's called Go Away.

37:45.267 --> 37:47.227
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

37:47.352 --> 37:50.481
...and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.

37:50.689 --> 37:52.441
Hey, where are you going?

37:54.151 --> 37:56.737
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

37:56.945 --> 37:59.865
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

37:59.865 --> 38:03.285
Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.371
- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.

38:05.496 --> 38:06.622
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

38:06.747 --> 38:08.624
You better get in there. New guy.

38:08.749 --> 38:11.627
He's trying to sell
some Spidey photos.

38:13.087 --> 38:14.671
Thanks.

38:14.755 --> 38:17.800
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.

38:17.925 --> 38:19.551
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

38:19.676 --> 38:22.054
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

38:22.179 --> 38:24.556
I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?

38:24.681 --> 38:27.601
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

38:27.684 --> 38:30.729
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

38:30.729 --> 38:31.980
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

38:32.189 --> 38:34.900
Congratulations, we'll use yours.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

38:35.025 --> 38:36.443
All right, J. J., I'm your man.

38:36.568 --> 38:39.363
I know more about a good picture
than any photographer.

38:39.488 --> 38:43.325
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.

38:43.367 --> 38:45.619
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

38:46.453 --> 38:47.913
I want a staff job, sir.

38:48.038 --> 38:51.250
I have a girl that I intend to marry...

38:51.375 --> 38:54.378
...and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...

38:54.503 --> 38:58.132
...of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

38:58.549 --> 38:59.925
J. Jonah Jameson.

39:03.345 --> 39:06.181
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

39:06.306 --> 39:07.516
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

39:07.641 --> 39:10.644
I know what makes a good picture
and I've been here a long time.

39:10.769 --> 39:12.855
If there's a staff job,
I think I deserve it.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.900
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

39:17.025 --> 39:18.986
You want a staff job,
you want a staff job.

39:19.111 --> 39:20.988
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

39:21.071 --> 39:22.948
Shut up. Get out.

39:23.073 --> 39:26.618
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

39:26.744 --> 39:30.998
He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.

39:31.081 --> 39:33.375
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.586
Whoever brings me that photo
gets a job.

39:35.669 --> 39:37.546
What're you waiting for,
Chinese New Year?

39:37.671 --> 39:39.131
I'm on it, boss.

39:40.591 --> 39:41.925
You'll never get that shot.

39:42.051 --> 39:43.385
Oh, we'll see.

39:57.900 --> 40:03.113
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

40:04.448 --> 40:06.241
Enough said.

40:11.455 --> 40:13.957
Welcome home, Harry.

40:14.792 --> 40:18.212
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

40:18.337 --> 40:20.422
- Bernard.
- Sir.

40:22.383 --> 40:25.010
Got you a little homecoming present.

40:25.969 --> 40:27.721
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

40:27.930 --> 40:28.972
Thanks, buddy.

40:29.807 --> 40:32.101
We were pretty good
in the backyard, weren't we?

40:32.226 --> 40:35.938
We were terrible.
And we tried out for the varsity team.

40:35.979 --> 40:38.023
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

40:38.232 --> 40:40.859
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

40:40.984 --> 40:42.111
You don't?

40:42.736 --> 40:45.447
Hey, Bernard.
Do I have any girlfriends?

40:45.447 --> 40:48.033
Not that I know of, sir.

40:53.497 --> 40:55.124
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

40:55.249 --> 40:57.000
It's okay.

40:57.126 --> 41:00.254
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

41:00.254 --> 41:04.091
Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.

41:11.515 --> 41:16.729
You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.

41:17.146 --> 41:19.857
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

41:21.316 --> 41:24.862
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

41:25.904 --> 41:30.492
Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.

41:30.492 --> 41:31.618
Okay.

41:32.995 --> 41:34.121
Heads up.

41:37.791 --> 41:38.834
Did you see that?

41:39.543 --> 41:41.837
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

42:15.537 --> 42:16.580
Why are we stopping?

42:20.751 --> 42:21.794
What is she doing here?

42:22.002 --> 42:23.962
Well, Gary was supposed
to call her agent.

42:26.507 --> 42:29.176
Hi, honey. We tried to reach you.

42:29.301 --> 42:30.844
I'm sorry.

42:30.969 --> 42:32.096
One critic?

42:32.221 --> 42:33.472
No, all the papers, dear.

42:34.515 --> 42:37.017
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

42:37.101 --> 42:39.812
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

42:50.656 --> 42:52.741
That was so poorly handled.

42:52.866 --> 42:54.326
Yeah.

42:54.827 --> 42:56.704
Let's just rehearse.

43:02.376 --> 43:04.753
All right, Spidey.

43:42.916 --> 43:45.002
<i>Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!</i>

43:45.210 --> 43:48.839
Excuse me, miss? Could I please
see that gorgeous smile?

43:48.839 --> 43:50.716
Hi, Eddie.

43:50.841 --> 43:54.053
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

43:54.178 --> 43:55.721
I gotta practice. See you later.

43:55.846 --> 43:57.806
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

43:57.931 --> 43:59.391
Why not?

43:59.600 --> 44:03.645
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

44:04.605 --> 44:07.816
We had a coffee, Eddie.

44:07.816 --> 44:09.610
Hey, beautiful.

44:10.235 --> 44:11.695
One more.

44:14.948 --> 44:17.409
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44:17.534 --> 44:21.789
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

44:21.914 --> 44:23.999
Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in
from over there.

44:24.124 --> 44:26.293
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

44:27.753 --> 44:29.088
Give them a good show.

44:29.963 --> 44:31.382
Don't worry about that review.

44:31.507 --> 44:35.052
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

44:35.177 --> 44:36.720
Yeah.

44:53.404 --> 44:56.198
Isn't that that guy
from that prison break?

44:56.323 --> 44:57.783
He fits.

44:57.991 --> 45:00.577
Hey, you. Halt.

45:01.328 --> 45:02.996
Cover the back.

45:06.458 --> 45:08.502
Hon, be careful.

45:57.009 --> 45:58.135
He's in the truck.

45:58.385 --> 46:00.345
Round the front.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.943
Fire.

46:39.009 --> 46:40.594
People of the city of New York...

46:40.803 --> 46:44.348
...I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...

46:44.431 --> 46:46.016
...and someone caught me.

46:46.225 --> 46:49.228
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

46:49.353 --> 46:53.190
Someone who doesn't even want us
to know who he is.

46:53.315 --> 46:54.358
Hey, M. J.

46:54.441 --> 46:56.860
- Harry.
- Hey.

46:56.944 --> 46:58.404
Where's Pete?

46:59.279 --> 47:01.323
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

47:01.448 --> 47:04.368
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

47:04.451 --> 47:05.828
I've never felt better.

47:05.953 --> 47:08.122
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

47:08.205 --> 47:11.041
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

47:11.250 --> 47:13.544
Will you bump me on the head?

47:15.629 --> 47:17.923
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

47:18.132 --> 47:20.843
You came. You sent me flowers.

47:20.968 --> 47:23.554
I did? I'll come again tonight.

47:24.054 --> 47:27.182
You can't. I was let go.

47:27.307 --> 47:29.184
What happened?

47:30.644 --> 47:32.187
I wasn't very good.

47:33.647 --> 47:35.733
You know, this is embarrassing...

47:35.858 --> 47:38.152
...but I once wrote you a play
in high school.

47:38.235 --> 47:40.029
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

47:40.154 --> 47:41.697
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

47:41.905 --> 47:45.242
So I ask you: When you're dropping
without a parachute...

47:45.242 --> 47:48.787
...or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire...

47:48.912 --> 47:50.956
...who is it that breaks your fall...

47:51.081 --> 47:54.835
...puts out the flames
and saves your children?

47:54.918 --> 47:56.587
Spider-Man.

47:56.712 --> 47:57.963
They love me.

47:58.088 --> 48:01.508
Then let's hear it
for your one and only...

48:01.508 --> 48:06.096
...friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

48:18.108 --> 48:21.403
Hey. What's up? All right.
How you doing?

48:22.863 --> 48:24.865
Shazam!

48:26.867 --> 48:27.868
Hey, guys.

48:28.118 --> 48:29.745
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

48:29.870 --> 48:32.039
Hey there. Hi.

48:33.832 --> 48:35.167
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

48:35.292 --> 48:38.212
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

48:39.129 --> 48:40.714
Go ahead, lay one on me.

48:40.798 --> 48:42.591
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.343
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

48:44.468 --> 48:45.719
No, Spider-Man, no.

48:45.803 --> 48:47.805
All right.

48:56.480 --> 48:59.274
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

49:04.697 --> 49:06.782
Hey, hey, are you okay?

49:06.907 --> 49:08.242
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:54.121 --> 49:56.206
Hey, man,
we got something on the roof.

50:18.812 --> 50:19.980
Jig's up, pal.

50:20.814 --> 50:23.609
I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.

50:23.734 --> 50:27.071
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

50:27.154 --> 50:28.322
Okay.

51:06.902 --> 51:08.362
Help!

51:42.896 --> 51:45.482
Where do all these guys come from?

52:38.869 --> 52:40.329
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

52:40.454 --> 52:43.874
<i>But this is a French restaurant, non?</i>

52:46.710 --> 52:49.797
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

52:53.675 --> 52:54.927
Here we are.

52:55.135 --> 52:57.304
Table for two. Parker.

52:58.472 --> 53:02.643
- Parker.
- That is what I said: Parker.

53:05.562 --> 53:06.897
I have a request.

53:07.022 --> 53:11.610
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

53:16.740 --> 53:18.367
Hello.

53:18.492 --> 53:21.412
Oh, so you want to
pop the question tonight, huh?

53:21.495 --> 53:24.415
Yes, and I wanna do something
very special.

53:24.665 --> 53:27.126
I love it. Romance.

53:27.251 --> 53:28.794
I am French.

53:30.796 --> 53:34.341
When I signal you, if you'd bring some
champagne with the ring...

53:34.550 --> 53:36.927
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

53:37.886 --> 53:40.180
Also, I thought at the same time...

53:40.264 --> 53:43.934
...if the musicians
would play this song...

53:44.852 --> 53:47.062
Their favorite.

53:47.271 --> 53:49.773
And take good care of the ring.

53:49.982 --> 53:52.568
<i>Oui, with my life, monsieur.</i>

53:55.529 --> 53:57.156
I like you.

54:00.284 --> 54:01.869
Thank you.

54:13.130 --> 54:15.299
Okay, so...

54:15.841 --> 54:18.218
Oh, would you like
some champagne?

54:21.889 --> 54:23.974
How'd that get in there?

54:25.225 --> 54:27.519
Oh, don't cry.

54:32.524 --> 54:33.650
Hi.

54:34.735 --> 54:36.779
Look at you. Wow, beautiful.

54:36.904 --> 54:38.447
Thanks.

54:42.743 --> 54:44.411
This place in your budget?

54:44.495 --> 54:46.705
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.

54:47.414 --> 54:48.999
You're on Broadway.

54:50.334 --> 54:52.336
I don't feel like
much of a star tonight.

54:52.419 --> 54:55.881
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

54:56.298 --> 54:57.549
Peter...

54:59.009 --> 55:01.095
...you have no idea
how I feel right now.

55:01.178 --> 55:04.306
Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.

55:04.848 --> 55:09.311
Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.

55:09.353 --> 55:11.313
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...

55:11.438 --> 55:13.816
...kids running around
with me on their sweaters...

55:13.941 --> 55:15.567
Big Halloween item.

55:15.693 --> 55:18.612
I don't know, I guess I've become
something of an icon.

55:18.696 --> 55:23.617
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

55:24.368 --> 55:27.788
I don't know, you know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself:

55:27.788 --> 55:31.834
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

55:33.961 --> 55:35.170
Hi, Pete.

55:35.629 --> 55:36.630
Hi.

55:44.471 --> 55:47.599
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

55:47.599 --> 55:50.310
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

55:50.519 --> 55:52.896
This is Mary Jane Watson.

55:54.273 --> 55:58.444
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

56:00.320 --> 56:04.491
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

56:04.491 --> 56:07.828
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

56:07.828 --> 56:09.788
Which actually reminds me...

56:09.913 --> 56:13.125
...Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...

56:13.250 --> 56:15.544
...could you bring it to class?

56:15.669 --> 56:20.007
I'd really love it. For my portfolio.

56:20.007 --> 56:23.052
After all,
who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?

56:23.677 --> 56:25.554
I can't imagine.

56:26.597 --> 56:29.391
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

56:30.267 --> 56:31.810
- Good night.
- Good night.

56:43.072 --> 56:44.948
Oh, she's in my science class.

56:45.157 --> 56:47.117
It's not her best subject.

56:49.536 --> 56:50.579
What?

56:50.788 --> 56:53.082
How come
you never mentioned her?

56:54.458 --> 56:56.919
She's your lab partner?

56:57.044 --> 56:59.213
You saved her life?

56:59.338 --> 57:00.672
She thinks you're a genius...

57:00.798 --> 57:04.218
...and she had her
polished fingernails all over you?

57:04.343 --> 57:05.886
Or didn't you notice?

57:07.471 --> 57:10.599
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

57:11.850 --> 57:13.936
I'll never forget that.

57:17.481 --> 57:18.941
She's just a girl in my class.

57:19.149 --> 57:20.901
Let me ask you something.

57:21.151 --> 57:23.112
When you kissed her...

57:23.237 --> 57:25.698
...who was kissing her?

57:25.823 --> 57:28.617
Spider-Man or Peter?

57:28.742 --> 57:31.745
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

57:31.870 --> 57:34.164
That was our kiss.

57:34.248 --> 57:35.833
Why would you do that?

57:36.667 --> 57:40.003
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

57:40.337 --> 57:43.966
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

57:44.091 --> 57:46.677
Why would I wanna push you away?
I love you.

57:46.677 --> 57:50.848
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M. J.

57:52.182 --> 57:54.393
I don't feel well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

57:54.518 --> 57:55.519
No, w...

57:57.187 --> 58:00.232
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

58:03.444 --> 58:05.029
Here we are.

58:41.398 --> 58:44.526
<i>Hi, it's M. J.</i>
<i>Sing your song at the beep.</i>

58:45.903 --> 58:47.363
Hello.

58:50.074 --> 58:53.827
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on or...

58:53.911 --> 58:56.955
<i>I don't know if you</i>
<i>got the messages or what.</i>

58:57.373 --> 58:58.499
<i>But...</i>

58:59.875 --> 59:02.586
<i>... I just wanna talk to you.</i>

59:03.837 --> 59:06.215
Okay, call me. Bye.

59:17.518 --> 59:19.061
<i>- Hello?</i>
- <i>Mr. Parker?</i>

59:19.269 --> 59:20.312
Yeah?

59:20.521 --> 59:23.023
<i>This is Detective Neil Garrett</i>
<i>from the 32nd Precinct.</i>

59:23.107 --> 59:24.983
<i>I'm calling on behalf</i>
<i>of Captain Stacy.</i>

59:25.109 --> 59:27.611
<i>He would like you</i>
<i>to come down to the station.</i>

59:27.695 --> 59:31.240
Originally, we thought that this man,
Dennis Carradine...

59:31.365 --> 59:33.325
...was your husband's killer.

59:33.659 --> 59:35.327
We were wrong.

59:35.869 --> 59:36.870
What?

59:36.995 --> 59:39.915
Turns out Mr. Carradine
was only an accomplice.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.501
The actual killer is still at large.

59:42.626 --> 59:44.378
What are you talking about?

59:44.503 --> 59:47.005
This is the man
who killed your husband.

59:51.802 --> 59:53.053
His name is Flint Marko.

59:53.262 --> 59:56.390
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

59:56.390 --> 59:57.850
You got this wrong.

59:58.058 --> 59:59.309
Two days ago he escaped.

01:00:00.144 --> 01:00:02.855
Evidently, he confessed his guilt
to a cellmate...

01:00:02.855 --> 01:00:06.817
...and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.

01:00:18.912 --> 01:00:21.498
No, wait, son.
You don't wanna do this.

01:00:24.752 --> 01:00:26.003
No!

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.681
Hey, get in! What are you doing?

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:58.327
Would you put these photos away,
please?

01:00:58.535 --> 01:01:00.913
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...

01:01:01.038 --> 01:01:03.540
...but, please, be patient with us.

01:01:03.624 --> 01:01:05.501
We're doing our job.
We will catch him.

01:01:05.626 --> 01:01:07.294
No, you're not doing your job.

01:01:07.378 --> 01:01:10.297
I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.

01:01:10.422 --> 01:01:13.550
Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

01:01:13.634 --> 01:01:15.844
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

01:01:16.053 --> 01:01:17.721
I have no intention of settling down.

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:20.516
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.943
<i>L-20 Parkway.</i>

01:01:31.068 --> 01:01:33.570
<i>All officers in the vicinity,</i>
<i>please report.</i>

01:01:33.904 --> 01:01:35.447
<i>We have an abandoned vehicle...</i>

01:01:35.656 --> 01:01:37.950
<i>... and an elderly man</i>
<i>in the middle of the street.</i>

01:01:38.075 --> 01:01:40.452
<i>Sorry, Wabash Avenue.</i>

01:01:43.372 --> 01:01:44.623
Peter, it's M. J.

01:01:45.999 --> 01:01:48.043
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

01:01:48.252 --> 01:01:49.420
Just please open up.

01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:59.638
Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.

01:01:59.638 --> 01:02:01.306
She's worried about you.

01:02:02.141 --> 01:02:03.600
I'm worried about you.

01:02:03.684 --> 01:02:05.144
Don't be. I'm fine.

01:02:05.769 --> 01:02:07.771
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

01:02:07.855 --> 01:02:10.357
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

01:02:10.482 --> 01:02:12.985
And do something you'll regret.

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:16.113
Like with that other guy.

01:02:16.739 --> 01:02:19.950
He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.

01:02:20.075 --> 01:02:23.287
<i>- I'm not accusing you of anything.</i>
- <i>10-22, auto at 556...</i>

01:02:23.537 --> 01:02:27.583
<i>- Will you turn that thing off?</i>
<i>- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.</i>

01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:32.588
<i>Y</i> e <i>ah, Central, this is Car 3-9</i>
<i>responding to your Sixth Avenue call.</i>

01:02:32.588 --> 01:02:36.008
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

01:02:36.133 --> 01:02:39.762
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...

01:02:39.803 --> 01:02:43.432
...but I wanna be here for you.

01:02:43.432 --> 01:02:46.769
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

01:02:46.769 --> 01:02:49.480
But I'm fine. I...

01:02:49.563 --> 01:02:51.440
I don't need your help.

01:02:58.864 --> 01:03:01.784
Everybody needs help sometimes,
Peter.

01:03:01.909 --> 01:03:03.744
Even Spider-Man.

01:03:12.002 --> 01:03:14.713

<i>Just give me a chance!</i>

01:04:39.798 --> 01:04:42.801
<i>What about my uncle?</i>
<i>Did you give him a chance?</i>

01:04:42.926 --> 01:04:44.053
<i>Did you?</i>

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.025
<i>Where am I?</i>

01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:15.959
What is this?

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:19.838
I feel...

01:05:24.426 --> 01:05:26.720
This feels good.

01:05:38.732 --> 01:05:40.484
Yeah!

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:58.293
This is something else.

01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:01.630
What do you think?

01:06:01.755 --> 01:06:03.924
I've never seen anything like it.

01:06:04.049 --> 01:06:05.926
I'm a physicist, not a biologist...

01:06:06.135 --> 01:06:08.929
...but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.

01:06:09.054 --> 01:06:10.097
Can we do that now?

01:06:15.102 --> 01:06:17.396
It seems to like you.

01:06:19.773 --> 01:06:22.484
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:25.195
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.532
...which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

01:06:28.657 --> 01:06:32.411
And sometimes these things in nature,
when they bind...

01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:34.913
...they can be hard to unbind.

01:06:36.165 --> 01:06:40.127

This is exactly what I n <i>ee</i> d
to scoop Parker.

01:07:45.609 --> 01:07:47.486
Give some of that web action.

01:07:49.154 --> 01:07:51.323
See you, chump.

01:07:52.908 --> 01:07:54.660
What the hell?

01:08:36.993 --> 01:08:38.162
Flint Marko.

01:08:40.997 --> 01:08:44.001
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

01:08:44.626 --> 01:08:47.755
The old man you shot down
in cold blood?

01:08:49.214 --> 01:08:50.883
What does it matter to you, anyway?

01:08:52.676 --> 01:08:54.094
Everything!

01:09:31.756 --> 01:09:34.134
It's time to pay, Marko!

01:10:44.121 --> 01:10:46.206
Good riddance.

01:11:06.977 --> 01:11:09.646
- Rent.
- Not now.

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.691
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

01:11:13.108 --> 01:11:15.069
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

01:11:15.194 --> 01:11:18.197
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

01:11:29.249 --> 01:11:31.251
That wasn't cool.

01:11:31.543 --> 01:11:35.714
He is a good boy.

01:11:37.424 --> 01:11:39.385
He must be in some kind of trouble.

01:12:27.349 --> 01:12:30.769
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...

01:12:31.645 --> 01:12:34.106
...he was killed last night.

01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:35.691
Oh, my.

01:12:36.525 --> 01:12:37.443
What happened?

01:12:38.193 --> 01:12:39.653
Spider-Man killed him.

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:42.656
Spider-Man?

01:12:43.615 --> 01:12:45.701
I don't understand.

01:12:45.826 --> 01:12:48.620
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.041
What happened?

01:12:54.668 --> 01:12:56.420
I...

01:12:57.254 --> 01:12:58.630
He...

01:12:59.256 --> 01:13:01.008
He was...

01:13:05.095 --> 01:13:08.098
I thought that you'd feel...

01:13:10.517 --> 01:13:12.478
He deserved it, didn't he?

01:13:13.228 --> 01:13:14.897
I don't think it's for us to say...

01:13:15.105 --> 01:13:19.276
...whether a person deserves
to live or die.

01:13:19.693 --> 01:13:22.488
But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.

01:13:22.613 --> 01:13:25.115
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:28.744
But he wouldn't want us living
one second...

01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:31.580
...with revenge in our hearts.

01:13:33.999 --> 01:13:36.460
It's like a poison. It can...

01:13:37.211 --> 01:13:39.296
It can take you over.

01:13:41.173 --> 01:13:46.387
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:02.945
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

01:14:47.906 --> 01:14:49.033
Hello?

01:14:49.158 --> 01:14:50.701
<i>Hey, Harry, it's M. J</i>.

01:14:50.826 --> 01:14:52.077
Hi.

01:14:52.202 --> 01:14:53.620
I need some company.

01:14:53.746 --> 01:14:56.248
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

01:14:56.373 --> 01:14:58.417
<i>Yeah, sure, come on over.</i>

01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:00.919
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

01:15:01.045 --> 01:15:03.630
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

01:15:03.881 --> 01:15:06.550
<i>- Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>
<i>- Great.</i>

01:15:06.675 --> 01:15:08.135
Bye.

01:15:09.053 --> 01:15:11.346
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

01:15:11.472 --> 01:15:13.766
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:16.060
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

01:15:16.185 --> 01:15:19.688
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

01:15:19.813 --> 01:15:21.482
Right away, sir.

01:15:38.248 --> 01:15:41.293
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.

01:15:41.794 --> 01:15:44.713
- An orange?
- No, thanks.

01:15:44.838 --> 01:15:48.801
Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.

01:15:48.801 --> 01:15:52.346
I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.

01:15:52.429 --> 01:15:54.306
It's no big deal.

01:15:54.515 --> 01:15:58.686
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.

01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:01.939
- Today's good.
- Okay.

01:16:02.064 --> 01:16:04.858
- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just...

01:16:04.942 --> 01:16:07.027
Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.

01:16:07.152 --> 01:16:10.989
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say:

01:16:10.989 --> 01:16:14.535
"You're a good woman.
I am good man."

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.417
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:22.793
He's calling a woman.

01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:24.878
Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...

01:16:25.087 --> 01:16:29.133
This is none of your business.
Go. Go. Call.

01:16:30.718 --> 01:16:33.429
- You should call.
- Thanks.

01:16:35.806 --> 01:16:38.100
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:16:51.905 --> 01:16:53.032
Hi.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.662
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:16:59.705 --> 01:17:01.165
Come on.

01:17:05.335 --> 01:17:07.713
- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.

01:17:31.612 --> 01:17:33.489
No. Please.

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:46.835
Oh, the butter.

01:17:56.970 --> 01:17:58.597
Beautiful.

01:18:03.102 --> 01:18:04.853
Check this out.

01:18:11.944 --> 01:18:14.363
Well, we can use that part.

01:18:16.031 --> 01:18:18.117
You've been dreaming.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.453
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

01:18:21.578 --> 01:18:24.456
- All right.
- When did you write that?

01:18:24.581 --> 01:18:27.501
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

01:18:27.501 --> 01:18:31.338
- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

01:18:31.463 --> 01:18:32.923
It's yours.

01:18:35.008 --> 01:18:38.554
You know, there's not even a scar.

01:18:40.014 --> 01:18:41.682
Barely.

01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:00.659
- Sorry.
- Me too.

01:19:00.868 --> 01:19:05.039
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

01:19:06.373 --> 01:19:08.042
Mary Jane.

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:10.669
Mary Jane.

01:19:11.378 --> 01:19:14.214
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

01:19:14.506 --> 01:19:15.883
Just...

01:19:27.978 --> 01:19:31.523
<i>You've taken your eye off the ball</i>.

01:19:37.654 --> 01:19:39.114
<i>Harry.</i>

01:19:52.169 --> 01:19:53.420
What have you done?

01:19:56.131 --> 01:19:57.591
Avenge me!

01:20:00.844 --> 01:20:04.973
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

01:20:05.015 --> 01:20:07.267
<i>Just wish I could remember</i>
<i>more about him.</i>

01:20:07.393 --> 01:20:10.521
<i>Well, he loved you.</i>
<i>That's the main thing.</i>

01:20:10.604 --> 01:20:13.857
<i>I swear on my father's grave,</i>
<i>Spider-Man will pay.</i>

01:20:14.608 --> 01:20:16.360
Harry.

01:20:18.028 --> 01:20:19.988
Remember me?

01:20:21.782 --> 01:20:24.910
Yes, Father. I remember.

01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:28.247
I was right about her. About Peter.

01:20:28.372 --> 01:20:30.624
About everything.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.963
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.

01:20:35.963 --> 01:20:38.340
Make him wish he were dead.

01:20:38.465 --> 01:20:42.511
First, we attack his heart.

01:20:52.521 --> 01:20:55.649
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>
<i>Sing your song at the beep.</i>

01:20:55.774 --> 01:20:58.694
<i>Hey, M. J. It's Peter.</i>

01:21:00.571 --> 01:21:03.490
<i>I wanna talk to you about last night</i>.

01:21:04.241 --> 01:21:06.410
<i>I don't know what I was thinking.</i>

01:21:06.535 --> 01:21:11.498
<i>I know you were just there</i>
<i>to help and I...</i>

01:21:11.498 --> 01:21:14.626
<i>I don't know. I wanna see you.</i>

01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:22.885
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

01:21:27.056 --> 01:21:28.599
- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

01:21:28.724 --> 01:21:30.476
Come in.

01:21:39.151 --> 01:21:40.903
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

01:21:41.028 --> 01:21:43.322
There's a phone call for you.

01:21:44.573 --> 01:21:46.241
It's Mary Jane, she called back.

01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:48.535
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:21:50.204 --> 01:21:55.834
- I put the phone on top of the thing.
- Thanks. Okay.

01:21:57.795 --> 01:21:59.380
<i>- Hey.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

01:21:59.588 --> 01:22:02.299
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to...

01:22:02.299 --> 01:22:05.219
<i>- Can you meet me?</i>
<i>- You bet.</i>

01:22:05.302 --> 01:22:07.805
<i>- Now?</i>
<i>- Okay. Where?</i>

01:22:07.930 --> 01:22:09.807
<i>At the bridge in the park.</i>

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:11.266
<i>- On my way.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:22:11.475 --> 01:22:14.478
Okay. Hey. I love you.

01:22:33.789 --> 01:22:35.874
You look beautiful.

01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:38.669
Peonies.

01:22:41.088 --> 01:22:43.799
- You okay?
- No.

01:22:44.758 --> 01:22:46.802
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

01:22:47.344 --> 01:22:48.804
Okay.

01:22:50.055 --> 01:22:51.724
It's not working.

01:22:52.766 --> 01:22:54.435
You and me.

01:22:55.561 --> 01:22:56.937
What?

01:22:57.271 --> 01:22:59.648
I don't wanna see you anymore.

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:02.026
What are you talking about?

01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:04.236
I don't know.

01:23:06.947 --> 01:23:08.699
I'm lonely.

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:12.244
You aren't there for me.

01:23:13.287 --> 01:23:15.789
I can't do this.

01:23:15.914 --> 01:23:21.837
- It's over.
- No. Please. Please don't say that.

01:23:22.171 --> 01:23:25.090
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:28.927
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

01:23:29.053 --> 01:23:31.138
We have problems.
When people have problems...

01:23:31.347 --> 01:23:34.141
...they work it out.
They talk to each other.

01:23:39.146 --> 01:23:40.939
Look, you see?

01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:44.068
You know what this is?

01:23:45.319 --> 01:23:48.530
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.

01:23:48.655 --> 01:23:51.575
I've fallen in love
with someone else.

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.723
Bravo.

01:24:24.733 --> 01:24:29.196
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

01:24:30.572 --> 01:24:32.866
There's another guy.

01:24:35.786 --> 01:24:37.663
Well, how you holding up?

01:24:38.288 --> 01:24:40.040
Not good.

01:24:42.126 --> 01:24:45.045
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.

01:24:45.587 --> 01:24:47.256
Really?

01:24:49.466 --> 01:24:53.512
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

01:24:53.512 --> 01:24:56.432
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

01:24:56.515 --> 01:24:59.643
It's not exactly
what she had in mind for herself.

01:24:59.768 --> 01:25:02.896
Singing waitress? What are you...?
What are you talking about?

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:07.568
Well, she was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?

01:25:07.901 --> 01:25:09.236
She was fired?

01:25:10.904 --> 01:25:16.243
She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?

01:25:17.703 --> 01:25:20.205
Well, that's why
I asked you here, Pete.

01:25:21.457 --> 01:25:23.542
I'm the other guy.

01:25:25.335 --> 01:25:27.087
What?

01:25:27.212 --> 01:25:30.215
Look, she came to me
one afternoon, troubled.

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.344
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

01:25:34.178 --> 01:25:37.306
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.

01:25:37.431 --> 01:25:39.183
It just...

01:25:39.391 --> 01:25:41.477
...started.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:52.112
I don't believe this.
I don't... I don't believe you.

01:25:52.237 --> 01:25:54.615
Look, I'm really sorry.

01:25:56.075 --> 01:25:58.452
I just thought you should know.

01:26:06.627 --> 01:26:10.130
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

01:26:11.715 --> 01:26:13.175
How's the pie?

01:26:14.218 --> 01:26:15.886
So good.

01:27:19.199 --> 01:27:21.035
Would you like a drink?

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.373
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

01:27:26.582 --> 01:27:29.293
Bad for the public image, right,
Mr. Key-to-the-City?

01:27:29.293 --> 01:27:30.544
What did you do to her?

01:27:32.713 --> 01:27:35.549
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.

01:27:36.383 --> 01:27:38.469
Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.

01:27:38.594 --> 01:27:43.766
- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.

01:27:43.807 --> 01:27:48.062
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.

01:27:48.395 --> 01:27:50.147
That taste...

01:27:51.815 --> 01:27:53.067
Strawberries.

01:28:28.727 --> 01:28:30.270
How'd you like that, Spidey?

01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:35.401
That all you got?

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.285
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:47.705
Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

01:29:34.918 --> 01:29:36.920
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:39.214
I'm done trying to convince you.

01:29:40.049 --> 01:29:43.594
You took him from me. He loved me.

01:29:43.594 --> 01:29:47.639
No. He despised you.

01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:50.059
You were an embarrassment to him.

01:29:53.687 --> 01:29:57.649
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

01:30:34.353 --> 01:30:36.647
Spider-Man used to
make me feel safe.

01:30:36.772 --> 01:30:38.857
Now I'm afraid
to walk home from work.

01:30:38.857 --> 01:30:42.611
- My son thought the world of this guy.
- I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:46.156
- Who's she to look up to?
- This is the guy they gave the key to?

01:30:47.324 --> 01:30:50.202
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

01:30:52.204 --> 01:30:55.416
- Cheers to the new staff photographer.
- Hey, I just got lucky.

01:30:55.541 --> 01:30:57.209
This is so wonderful for you.

01:30:57.418 --> 01:31:01.171
Well, you might wanna tell J. J.
To make a little more wall space.

01:31:06.176 --> 01:31:09.722
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

01:31:09.722 --> 01:31:12.307
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

01:31:13.058 --> 01:31:14.810
There's your hero.

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:19.940
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.651
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

01:31:22.776 --> 01:31:24.111
Funny you should say that...

01:31:24.319 --> 01:31:28.699
...because I was looking through
some old photos and it looks very...

01:31:28.699 --> 01:31:30.576
...similar.

01:31:31.702 --> 01:31:34.747
Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.

01:31:35.789 --> 01:31:38.917
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

01:31:39.043 --> 01:31:41.003
Your picture's a fake.

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:46.091
Oh, Parker,
you are such a boy scout.

01:31:46.216 --> 01:31:48.302
When are you gonna
give a guy a break?

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:52.556
You want forgiveness? Get religion.

01:31:52.681 --> 01:31:56.310
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

01:31:59.355 --> 01:32:03.108
Yeah. No, we...
We're just horsing around.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:07.571
Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.

01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:09.865
There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.

01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:12.368
You should've
thought of that earlier.

01:32:13.118 --> 01:32:15.412
What are you doing, Peter?

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:19.875
Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.

01:32:25.923 --> 01:32:27.508
It's a fake.

01:32:27.591 --> 01:32:31.762
Empire State
Photographic Department confirms it.

01:32:35.224 --> 01:32:37.184
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:39.812
- I was just trying...
- You're fired.

01:32:41.271 --> 01:32:43.649
We're gonna have to
print a retraction now.

01:32:43.774 --> 01:32:45.859
I haven't printed a retraction
in 20 years.

01:32:52.116 --> 01:32:54.702
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.</i>

01:32:54.952 --> 01:32:59.206
Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:02.418
Quite a specimen
you left me, Parker.

01:33:02.751 --> 01:33:07.548
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

01:33:07.548 --> 01:33:08.590
Thanks.

01:33:08.799 --> 01:33:11.385
<i>- That's good.</i>
- <i>You know what, Parker?</i>

01:33:13.303 --> 01:33:16.181
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

01:33:16.932 --> 01:33:20.477
It amplifies characteristics
of its host.

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:24.440
<i>- Hey, give me another cookie.</i>
<i>- Especially aggression.</i>

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.234
This could be dangerous.

01:33:27.359 --> 01:33:31.113
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

01:33:31.113 --> 01:33:34.950
- You got any with nuts?
- I have some nuts. I could make some.

01:33:34.992 --> 01:33:36.618
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:39.455
No, no, no. Course not.

01:33:53.844 --> 01:33:55.721
These shots are so good.

01:33:55.846 --> 01:33:58.432
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

01:33:58.849 --> 01:34:02.269
Peter Parker. Peter.

01:34:02.394 --> 01:34:06.857
Parker. Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

01:34:06.857 --> 01:34:08.442
Black-suit Spider-Man.

01:34:09.902 --> 01:34:12.071
Peter, these are incredible.

01:34:12.196 --> 01:34:15.199
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

01:34:17.117 --> 01:34:19.787
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...

01:34:19.912 --> 01:34:21.789
...double the money.

01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:48.208
Penny.

01:35:54.298 --> 01:35:56.967
You are really gonna dig this joint.

01:35:58.344 --> 01:36:00.429
Do you think I'm...?
I'm dressed all right?

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:02.097
Too fancy or too...

01:36:02.222 --> 01:36:06.352
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:10.230
- Thank you.
- Love that little giggle.

01:36:12.941 --> 01:36:14.818
Hey, keep it open there, pops.

01:36:18.155 --> 01:36:21.700
Oh, this is so cool.

01:36:21.825 --> 01:36:24.495
I have never been
to a jazz club before.

01:36:27.331 --> 01:36:30.667
Oh, I hope we can get a table.

01:36:35.339 --> 01:36:37.841
Find us some shade.

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:41.095
Thanks, hot legs.

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:44.014
Right this way, sir.

01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:53.482
Oh, why, thank you.

01:36:58.696 --> 01:37:02.783
- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

01:37:08.205 --> 01:37:11.750
- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:16.338
- Do you wanna go someplace else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.

01:37:16.338 --> 01:37:19.258
- Mary Jane <i>, s</i> how us what you got.
- I'll take that.

01:37:24.888 --> 01:37:28.100
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

01:37:37.067 --> 01:37:38.235
Peter?

01:37:41.238 --> 01:37:43.323
This is for you.

01:37:48.871 --> 01:37:50.539
Double-time.

01:37:55.753 --> 01:37:57.421
Thanks.

01:38:24.114 --> 01:38:25.991
Now dig on this.

01:38:27.242 --> 01:38:28.369
That is hot.

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:11.328
That was all for her?

01:39:20.004 --> 01:39:21.547
I'm so sorry.

01:39:33.976 --> 01:39:36.478
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.022
Okay.

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:42.401
Hey.

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:45.946
What's wrong with you?

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:48.574
You.

01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:52.202
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

01:39:52.327 --> 01:39:54.413
Is everything okay here, Paul?

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:56.915
Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?

01:39:56.915 --> 01:39:59.418
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

01:39:59.543 --> 01:40:02.421
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

01:40:02.546 --> 01:40:06.091
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:10.137
Peter, stop it!

01:40:21.732 --> 01:40:23.192
Who are you?

01:40:25.569 --> 01:40:27.237
I don't know.

01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:01.707
It's Brock, sir.

01:42:01.832 --> 01:42:04.418
Edward Brock Jr.

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.797
I come before you today...

01:42:10.174 --> 01:42:11.842
...humbled...

01:42:13.719 --> 01:42:15.804
...and humiliated...

01:42:18.724 --> 01:42:21.018
...to ask you for one thing.

01:42:26.523 --> 01:42:28.400
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:20.452
Parker.

01:45:04.515 --> 01:45:06.809
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

01:45:09.311 --> 01:45:13.691
You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.

01:45:14.108 --> 01:45:18.487
Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?

01:45:24.535 --> 01:45:26.829
When we spoke on the phone...

01:45:26.954 --> 01:45:29.415
...I sensed that something
was bothering you...

01:45:30.165 --> 01:45:33.585
...so I thought I'd just come by.

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:38.382
How's Mary Jane?

01:45:38.716 --> 01:45:40.384
I don't know.

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:45.389
I never heard from you.

01:45:45.472 --> 01:45:48.100
Did you ever propose?

01:45:51.979 --> 01:45:53.731
You said...

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:58.193
...a husband's gotta put a wife
before himself.

01:46:03.323 --> 01:46:05.409
I'm not ready.

01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:09.788
But what happened?

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:13.125
You seemed so sure.

01:46:14.376 --> 01:46:15.919
Yeah.

01:46:17.296 --> 01:46:18.964
I...

01:46:29.266 --> 01:46:31.685
I hurt her, Aunt May.

01:46:32.936 --> 01:46:35.022
I don't know what to do.

01:46:36.899 --> 01:46:40.652
Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:

01:46:41.362 --> 01:46:44.490
You forgive yourself.

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:50.037
I believe in you, Peter.

01:46:50.245 --> 01:46:53.165
You're a good person.

01:46:54.124 --> 01:46:59.088
And I know you will find a way
to put it right.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.597
In time.

01:47:26.657 --> 01:47:29.034
End of the line, Spider-Man.

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.499
I want him dead too, Flint.

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:38.210
That's why
I've been looking for you.

01:47:38.335 --> 01:47:41.755
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.

01:47:41.839 --> 01:47:46.218
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:49.555
It's just...
That doesn't seem right to me.

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.893
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

01:47:54.893 --> 01:47:58.230
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

01:47:59.189 --> 01:48:01.233
Interested?

01:48:02.526 --> 01:48:04.069
Yeah.

01:49:06.006 --> 01:49:06.924
So...

01:49:08.509 --> 01:49:09.760
...where to?

01:49:10.928 --> 01:49:12.680
<i>All New York is holding its breath...</i>

01:49:12.888 --> 01:49:15.599
<i>... as the hostage crisis</i>
<i>continues to unfold.</i>

01:49:17.267 --> 01:49:18.519
<i>Just 30 minutes ago...</i>

01:49:18.602 --> 01:49:20.813
<i>... police came across</i>
<i>this startling sight:</i>

01:49:20.938 --> 01:49:23.107
<i>A young woman,</i>
<i>held hostage in a taxi...</i>

01:49:23.315 --> 01:49:25.609
<i>... suspended 80 stories</i>
<i>above the ground...</i>

01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:28.612
<i>... in what appears to be</i>
<i>a giant web.</i>

01:49:28.737 --> 01:49:31.448
<i>Every attempt by the police</i>
<i>to rescue the hostage...</i>

01:49:31.532 --> 01:49:33.325
<i>... has been thwarted</i>
<i>by the Sandman.</i>

01:49:36.787 --> 01:49:38.122
<i>Compounding the danger...</i>

01:49:38.205 --> 01:49:41.125
<i>... is the appearance</i>
<i>of a strange black-suited figure.</i>

01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:45.087
<i>Early reports had believed him</i>
<i>to be the black-suited Spider-Man...</i>

01:49:45.129 --> 01:49:48.757
<i>... but he has now been identified</i>
<i>as something entirely different.</i>

01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:53.971
<i>The hostage has been identified</i>
<i>as Mary Jane Watson...</i>

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:58.225
<i>... an actress recently seen</i>
<i>in a brief stint on Broadway.</i>

01:50:23.792 --> 01:50:26.170
<i>We're now going to take you</i>
<i>live to the scene...</i>

01:50:26.295 --> 01:50:28.172
<i>... with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?</i>

01:50:28.255 --> 01:50:30.883
<i>We're only about</i>
<i>100 feet away now, Hal, and...</i>

01:50:30.883 --> 01:50:34.845
<i>Wait. There seems to be</i>
<i>some kind of activity in the web.</i>

01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:38.599
<i>They seem to be creating</i>
<i>some kind of gigantic lettering.</i>

01:50:41.518 --> 01:50:44.313
<i>Spider-Man's being challenged</i>
<i>to some sort of confrontation.</i>

01:50:44.438 --> 01:50:46.190
<i>And that raises serious questions...</i>

01:50:46.315 --> 01:50:49.526
<i>... about what kind of chance he'd</i>
<i>stand against such overwhelming...</i>

01:51:00.079 --> 01:51:01.330
Harry?

01:51:04.875 --> 01:51:06.960
I need your help.

01:51:07.378 --> 01:51:10.798
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

01:51:17.304 --> 01:51:20.182
You don't deserve my help.

01:51:22.893 --> 01:51:24.353
Harry...

01:51:25.104 --> 01:51:27.189
...she needs us.

01:51:31.777 --> 01:51:33.320
Get out.

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.214
If I may, sir?

01:51:52.923 --> 01:51:58.554
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.

01:51:58.887 --> 01:52:00.556
What are you trying to tell me?

01:52:01.265 --> 01:52:04.101
The night your father died...

01:52:04.184 --> 01:52:06.812
...I cleaned his wound.

01:52:08.272 --> 01:52:12.026
The blade that pierced his body...

01:52:12.026 --> 01:52:14.820
...came from his glider.

01:52:15.571 --> 01:52:20.576
I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor...

01:52:20.576 --> 01:52:25.998
...but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.

01:52:29.043 --> 01:52:31.503
I loved your father...

01:52:32.671 --> 01:52:35.799
...as I have loved you, Harry.

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:39.219
As your friends love you.

01:53:26.266 --> 01:53:27.518
Look.

01:53:48.372 --> 01:53:52.001
<i>Spider-Man! Spider-Man!</i>
<i>Spider-Man!</i>

01:53:57.464 --> 01:53:59.425
He seems to have
come out of nowhere...

01:53:59.550 --> 01:54:01.593
.<i>...</i> to answer the prayers of the city...

01:54:01.719 --> 01:54:03.804
...just when all hope
seemed to be lost.

01:54:09.727 --> 01:54:12.646
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

01:54:12.771 --> 01:54:16.400
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:27.161
Hey, Parker.

01:54:27.369 --> 01:54:28.620
My God. Eddie.

01:54:29.246 --> 01:54:30.998
My spider-sense is tingling...

01:54:32.583 --> 01:54:35.377
...if you know what I'm talking about.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.357
We can find a way to settle this.

01:54:56.565 --> 01:54:58.025
You're so right.

01:54:58.108 --> 01:55:01.653
I'm thinking humiliation.

01:55:02.279 --> 01:55:04.698
Kind of like how you humiliated me.

01:55:05.532 --> 01:55:07.284
Do you remember?

01:55:09.078 --> 01:55:11.997
Do you remember
what you did to me?

01:55:27.304 --> 01:55:31.058
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

01:55:32.851 --> 01:55:34.812
How's that sound, tiger?

01:56:34.705 --> 01:56:36.332
Hold on, Mary Jane!

01:57:06.487 --> 01:57:08.989
Mary Jane!

01:58:09.258 --> 01:58:13.220
It's hard to believe
what's happening.

01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.597
The brutality of it.

01:58:16.348 --> 01:58:18.225
I don't know how
he can take any more.

01:58:18.308 --> 01:58:21.979
<i>This could be a tragic day</i>
<i>for the people of New York.</i>

01:58:21.979 --> 01:58:24.064
<i>It could be the end of Spider-Man.</i>

01:58:50.424 --> 01:58:52.718
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

01:59:17.659 --> 01:59:19.119
You came.

01:59:27.044 --> 01:59:29.129
Looks like just in the nick of time.

01:59:29.338 --> 01:59:31.924
A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.

01:59:32.049 --> 01:59:33.509
What are you gonna do?

01:59:37.054 --> 01:59:39.139
I may need some help over here.

01:59:39.223 --> 01:59:41.725
I'm a little busy right now.

01:59:42.685 --> 01:59:44.561
Give me your hand.

01:59:58.951 --> 02:00:01.954
Parker! Parker, where...?

02:00:02.079 --> 02:00:03.539
I need a photographer.

02:00:03.747 --> 02:00:05.082
Hey, kid, you want a job?

02:00:05.207 --> 02:00:08.627
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

02:00:08.752 --> 02:00:11.755
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:13.340
A hundred bucks?

02:00:15.092 --> 02:00:18.971
All right, you little crook. Here.

02:00:20.639 --> 02:00:21.974
What the...?

02:00:23.851 --> 02:00:25.519
Film's extra.

02:00:31.358 --> 02:00:33.152
Gotcha.

02:00:41.201 --> 02:00:42.411
Pete, up top.

02:01:02.348 --> 02:01:04.433
Mary Jane.

02:01:06.518 --> 02:01:08.395
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

02:01:08.479 --> 02:01:09.646
To what?

02:01:14.151 --> 02:01:15.903
- Go, buddy.
- Got her.

02:01:27.164 --> 02:01:28.207
You okay?

02:01:30.417 --> 02:01:31.960
Yeah.

02:01:34.672 --> 02:01:37.174
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

02:01:39.468 --> 02:01:41.136
Am I interrupting?

02:02:57.463 --> 02:02:59.340
Never wound...

02:03:00.090 --> 02:03:02.134
...what you can't kill.

02:03:05.929 --> 02:03:09.558
Eddie, the suit,
you gotta take it off.

02:03:09.558 --> 02:03:11.310
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:16.106
I know what it feels like.

02:03:16.648 --> 02:03:18.317
It feels good.

02:03:18.442 --> 02:03:21.028
The power. Everything.

02:03:21.028 --> 02:03:23.739
But you'll lose yourself.

02:03:24.156 --> 02:03:26.033
Let it go.

02:03:26.241 --> 02:03:28.327
I like being bad.

02:03:29.370 --> 02:03:31.246
It makes me happy.

02:04:20.671 --> 02:04:21.714
Harry!

02:05:34.828 --> 02:05:37.206
Peter. What are you doing?

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.917
No!

02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:42.711
Eddie!

02:06:02.231 --> 02:06:04.108
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

02:06:04.316 --> 02:06:06.193
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

02:06:07.027 --> 02:06:08.487
Stay.

02:06:17.246 --> 02:06:18.914
I didn't want this.

02:06:23.711 --> 02:06:26.005
But I had no choice.

02:06:29.633 --> 02:06:31.719
We always have a choice.

02:06:31.844 --> 02:06:34.138
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:38.726
My daughter was dying.

02:06:40.811 --> 02:06:42.771
I needed money.

02:06:47.484 --> 02:06:49.445
I was scared.

02:06:56.994 --> 02:07:00.080
<i>I told your uncle</i>
<i>all I wanted was the car.</i>

02:07:00.205 --> 02:07:02.166
- What is it?
- I need your car.

02:07:02.708 --> 02:07:05.210
He said to me:

02:07:05.336 --> 02:07:08.213
"Why don't you just put down the gun
and go home?"

02:07:12.176 --> 02:07:15.220
<i>I realize now</i>
<i>he was just trying to help me.</i>

02:07:21.894 --> 02:07:25.022
<i>Then I saw my partner</i>
<i>running over with the cash.</i>

02:07:25.022 --> 02:07:27.524
<i>And the gun was in my hand.</i>

02:07:37.868 --> 02:07:39.286
Get in.

02:07:41.205 --> 02:07:43.582
<i>Did a terrible thing to you...</i>

02:07:44.833 --> 02:07:48.379
<i>... and I spent a lot of nights</i>
<i>wishing I could take it back.</i>

02:07:53.592 --> 02:07:56.178
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

02:07:57.054 --> 02:07:59.431
I just want you to understand.

02:08:09.233 --> 02:08:11.944
I've done terrible things too.

02:08:28.210 --> 02:08:31.005
I didn't choose to be this.

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:42.182
The only thing left of me now...

02:08:44.268 --> 02:08:46.228
...is my daughter.

02:08:58.449 --> 02:09:00.534
I forgive you.

02:09:43.827 --> 02:09:46.830
Hey, pal. How you doing?

02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:48.499
Been better.

02:09:50.084 --> 02:09:52.044
We'll get you through this.

02:09:55.673 --> 02:09:57.257
No.

02:10:04.848 --> 02:10:07.059
I should never have hurt you...

02:10:08.936 --> 02:10:11.230
...said those things.

02:10:12.898 --> 02:10:15.484
None of that matters, Peter.

02:10:17.486 --> 02:10:19.363
You're my friend.

02:10:23.951 --> 02:10:25.828
Best friend.

02:10:44.722 --> 02:10:46.348
Harry.

02:11:32.353 --> 02:11:34.521
<i>Whatever comes our way...</i>

02:11:35.606 --> 02:11:39.943
<i>... what</i> e <i>ver battle we have raging</i>
<i>inside us, we always have a choice.</i>

02:11:41.862 --> 02:11:44.031
<i>My friend Harry taught me that.</i>

02:11:44.239 --> 02:11:47.576
<i>He chose to be the best of himself.</i>

02:11:48.202 --> 02:11:51.330
<i>It's the choices</i>
<i>that make us who we are...</i>

02:11:51.455 --> 02:11:54.958
<i>... and we can always choose</i>
<i>to do what's right.</i>
