THE FOUR OF US, HANGING OUT.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.244
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD DO THIS
A LOT MORE OFTEN.

00:12.246 --> 00:15.247
WAIT.
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER?

00:15.249 --> 00:16.315
WHERE ARE MOM AND DAD?

DISPERSE.

HMM, THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE?

00:56.323 --> 00:57.489
YEAH, NO.
I THINK I REMEMBER.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.992
WELL, IN ALL
OF THE EXCITEMENT

00:59.994 --> 01:02.394
IT SEEMS WE FORGOT
A FEW THINGS.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.996
YEAH. YOUR HAIRBRUSH.

01:03.998 --> 01:06.215
YOUR SUNSCREEN.

01:06.216 --> 01:08.433
THE FACT THAT YOU DIDN'T DO
YOUR FINAL PROJECT
FOR SIXTH GRADE.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.968
( laughs )

01:09.970 --> 01:12.237
WAIT, WHAT?
YOU MEAN, LIKE I...

01:12.239 --> 01:13.372
NEVER FINISHED
SIXTH GRADE?

01:13.374 --> 01:15.240
WELL, I JUST FOUND OUT
THIS MORNING.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.775
YOU SEE...
( laughs )

01:16.776 --> 01:18.309
AS VICE PRINCIPAL
I'M IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE

01:18.312 --> 01:20.345
THAT EVERYONE'S
ACADEMIC TRANSCRIPTS
ARE UP TO DATE.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.381
BUT IT'LL BE FINE
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL SAYS

01:22.383 --> 01:24.349
YOU CAN COMPLETE
THE PROJECT NOW.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.418
HA! CLASSIC.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.554
LIV HAS HOMEWORK
THAT'S FIVE YEARS LATE.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.924
ACTUALLY, LIV...

01:31.926 --> 01:35.394
THE TEACHER SAYS
THAT TO PASS THE SIXTH GRADE,

01:35.396 --> 01:38.330
YOU HAVE TO FINISH
THE PROJECT...
IN CLASS.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.399
( laughs )

01:41.335 --> 01:42.468
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.269
LIV...

01:44.271 --> 01:46.371
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK

01:46.373 --> 01:48.340
- WHAT?

01:48.342 --> 01:50.375
OH, I DIDN'T THINK
IT COULD GET ANY BETTER.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.344
AND THEN IT DID!

01:52.346 --> 01:54.346
( horn blares )

01:54.348 --> 01:57.382
I AM NOT GOING BACK
TO THE SIXTH GRADE.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.351
WELL, THEN YOU ARE NOT

01:59.353 --> 02:01.420
GOING TO GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.922
WAIT...

02:03.924 --> 02:05.491
YOU SAID THIS EFFECTED
TWO OF US. WHO'S THE OTHER?

02:05.493 --> 02:09.061
OH, PLEASE SAY JOEY HAS

02:09.063 --> 02:11.063
YES, PLEASE

02:11.065 --> 02:13.298
I LOVED IT THERE.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.001
NO, THIS ISN'T ABOUT JOEY.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.153
HEY, EVERYBODY...

03:41.155 --> 03:46.024
LET'S GIVE MY SISTER
A PROPER SIXTH GRADE WELCOME.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.025
- OH.
- READY?

03:47.027 --> 03:48.093
FIRE!

03:48.095 --> 03:49.394
( squeals )

03:52.032 --> 03:53.165
( chuckles )

03:53.167 --> 03:55.434
I HAD TO MAKE THE BEST
OF THIS VERY...

03:55.436 --> 03:57.135
HUMILIATING SITUATION,

03:57.137 --> 03:59.004
SO I DECIDED IF YOU'RE
GOING TO BE IN SIXTH GRADE,

03:59.006 --> 04:00.572
YOU BETTER BE...

04:00.574 --> 04:03.175
IN SIXTH GRADE.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.513
I AM ONE OF YOU!

04:13.487 --> 04:17.456
YES, I AM THE SPIT WAD QUEEN!

04:18.192 --> 04:19.424
MISS ROONEY?

04:19.426 --> 04:20.525
AH! OH.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.061
HI, MRS. SNODGRASS.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.529
WELL, I SEE YOU'RE STILL

04:24.531 --> 04:26.565
NOT MATURE ENOUGH
FOR SIXTH GRADE.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.002
MRS. SNODGRASS ALWAYS HATED ME.

04:30.004 --> 04:31.536
WHEN I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE
THE FIRST TIME

04:31.538 --> 04:34.473
I ACCIDENTALLY CALLED HER
MRS. "SNOTGRASS."

04:34.475 --> 04:36.174
( laughs )

04:36.176 --> 04:39.144
WHAT? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I... SWEAR.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.215
IF YOU'RE DONE WITH
YOUR LITTLE MINI RIOT,

04:43.217 --> 04:46.451
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF I BEGAN EDUCATING?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.223
OH, PARKER. THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SAVING...

04:51.225 --> 04:53.091
ME A SEAT.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.227
SORRY, SIS, BUT YOU'VE
DUG YOURSELF

04:55.229 --> 04:57.029
A PRETTY DEEP HOLE.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.497
I'M GONNA NEED
TO KEEP MY DISTANCE.

05:00.234 --> 05:03.468
OOH, THAT'S COLD,
DR. P.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.971
THE MAN SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.105
YOU'RE POISON.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.147
OOH!

05:15.149 --> 05:16.315
SAMANTHA, YEAH.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.482
YOU HAVE TWO TARDIES
THIS WEEK.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.484
ONE MORE AND YOU'LL SEE ME
IN DETENTION.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.253
I JUST GOT MY SECOND TARDY
LAST PERIOD.

05:21.255 --> 05:24.156
- ( laughs )
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

05:24.158 --> 05:26.124
I SEE ALL.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.528
AFTER LIV'S ACADEMIC RECORD
SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS,

05:29.530 --> 05:33.031
I REALIZED HOW OUT OF DATE
RIDGEWOOD HIGH IS.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.150
SO I BROUGHT IN. ..

05:35.151 --> 05:37.268
THE MOST SOPHISTICATED
COMPUTER MIND IN WISCONSIN.

05:37.271 --> 05:40.122
THAT WOULD BE ME.

05:40.123 --> 05:42.974
I BUILT THIS SUPER-TINY CHIP
THAT HOLDS ALL THE POWER
OF THE INTERNET.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.543
I OFFERED TO IMPLANT IT
IN MOM'S EYEBALL,

05:44.545 --> 05:46.044
SHE SAID NO.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.113
( scoffs )
COWARD.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.181
SO INSTEAD I ATTACHED IT
TO THESE GLASSES.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.117
INTRODUCING...

05:52.119 --> 05:54.119
OMNI-SPECS.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.121
IT'S A SUPERCOMPUTER...

05:56.123 --> 05:59.124
- ( glasses booting up )
- ...ON MY FACE.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.160
OH! ISAAC.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.030
YEAH. YOUR LIBRARY BOOKS
ARE FIVE DAYS OVERDUE.
RETURN THEM.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.099
AND THANK YOU FOR USING
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.266
( laughs )

06:10.037 --> 06:12.037
OH! HI, KIDS.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.306
HEY! WELCOME
TO TEAM GLASSES, MOM.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.241
YEAH, YOU'RE IN
GOOD COMPANY.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.977
CLARK KENT, HARRY POTTER,
AND WALDO...

06:18.979 --> 06:20.145
IF YOU CAN FIND HIM.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.015
YOUR GLASSES HELP YOU
SEE THE WORLD.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.218
MY GLASSES HELP ME
RULE THE WORLD.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.053
- ( beeping )
- OH-OH.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.188
EMERGENCY IN
THE BIOLOGY LAB.
THE MICE GOT OUT.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.157
OH DEAR.
I NEED SOMEBODY
WITH LIGHTENING QUICK REFLEXES.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.159
MADDIE, YOU'RE WITH ME.
COME ON.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.627
NEED MY HELP, MOM?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.964
UMM...

06:38.966 --> 06:41.233
SHE NEEDS YOU
TO HOLD MY JACKET.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.102
YAY! I'M USEFUL.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.975
HEY!
NICE LETTERMAN JACKET.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.210
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.345
( giggles )

06:53.347 --> 06:56.114
AH, A JOCK WITH
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.249
A JOCK?

06:57.251 --> 06:59.084
WHAT, ARE YOU NEW HERE?

06:59.086 --> 07:02.087
ACTUALLY, YEAH.
IT'S MY FIRST DAY.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.055
AND I'M GUESSING
THEY DON'T JUST GIVE OUT

07:04.057 --> 07:06.224
LETTERMAN JACKETS TO SOMEONE
IF THEY'RE NOT A JOCK.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.027
WHICH IS GOOD,
BECAUSE I'M REALLY
INTO JOCKS.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.329
( laughs nervously )
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME.

07:12.366 --> 07:15.066
SHE THINKS I'M A JOCK.

07:15.068 --> 07:19.070
A GENTLEMAN WOULD CORRECT
THIS MISUNDERSTANDING.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.039
THAT'S ME!
I'M A JOCK.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.175
AND I'M ALSO A JOEY.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.309
I'M KENNEDY.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.144
SEE YOU AROUND SOMETIME,
JOEY JOCK.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.214
YEP. PROBABLY AT ONE
OF MY SPORTS GAMES.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.318
WHOO! BIO LAB CRISIS
ADVERTED.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.154
WHO CARES? A CUTE GIRL
JUST TALKED TO ME.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.289
REALLY?

07:37.291 --> 07:40.058
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.093
'CAUSE SHE THINKS
I'M A JOCK.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.361
WHAT? IS SHE NEW HERE?

07:43.363 --> 07:46.097
YES! AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ANY BETTER.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.132
THE CLOCK IS TICKING,
MADDIE.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.067
MAKE ME A JOCK, PLEASE?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.103
OKAY, JOEY,
IT IS A HORRIBLE IDEA

07:52.105 --> 07:53.271
TO PRETEND TO BE
SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.041
I KNOW. I KNOW,
BUT I'VE GOT A PLAN.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.142
I'M GONNA FOOL HER

07:57.144 --> 07:59.244
UNTIL SHE FINDS ME
IRRESISTIBLE

07:59.246 --> 08:01.313
AND THEN I'M GONNA SAY,
"SURPRISE!

08:01.315 --> 08:04.082
I'M A TRICKY RASCAL."
ISN'T THAT CUTE?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.188
I SEE YOU'VE ALL HAD
THE CHANCE TO MEET

08:10.190 --> 08:12.023
OUR NEWEST STUDENT,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.391
LIV ROONEY.

08:15.362 --> 08:19.030
SHE'S A YOUNG WOMAN WHO THOUGHT
RUNNING OFF TO HOLLYWOOD

08:19.032 --> 08:22.033
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN HER ACADEMIC COMMITMENTS.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.035
WELL, YOU SEE,
ABOUT THAT--

08:24.037 --> 08:27.005
MISS ROONEY,
YOU DID NOT RAISE YOUR HAND.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.108
PERHAPS YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
HOW SIXTH GRADE WORKS.

08:31.245 --> 08:34.145
THIS WEEK
IS GROUP PROJECTS WEEK.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.114
EACH GROUP WILL PERFORM

08:36.116 --> 08:38.250
PART OF A CLASSIC
SHAKESPEARE PLAY.

08:38.252 --> 08:39.384
OH!

08:39.386 --> 08:41.286
I LOVE SHAKESPEARE.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.289
YOU ALSO LOVE TALKING
WHEN YOU AREN'T CALLED ON.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.676
YES, EVAN?

08:47.677 --> 08:49.194
PERHAPS LIV COULD BENEFIT
FROM A TRIP

08:49.196 --> 08:52.130
TO THE ATTITUDE
ADJUSTMENT CHAIR.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.133
Students:
OOH!

08:55.135 --> 08:56.268
( laughs )

08:56.270 --> 08:57.369
NO. NO.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.204
PLEASE, MRS. SNODGRASS,
NOT THE CHAIR.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.338
I SWEAR,
I CAN BE BETTER.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.207
SIT.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.276
AND THINK ABOUT
WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.446
Students:
OOH!

09:18.258 --> 09:20.175
<i>ALL RIGHT, STUDENTS,</i>

09:20.176 --> 09:22.093
PICK YOUR PARTNERS FOR
THE GROUP PROJECT.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.229
WE'LL TAKE THE NEW KID.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.715
I WAS SO TOUCHED

09:26.716 --> 09:28.266
THAT PARKER WANTED
TO BE IN A GROUP WITH ME.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.269
( giggles )
GREATEST LITTLE BROTHER EVER.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.039
I HATE PRESENTATIONS,

09:34.041 --> 09:36.007
BUT I KNEW LIV WOULD DO
ALL THE WORK.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.659
I'M NO DUMMY.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.310
YOU DON'T SEE ME FAILING
SIXTH GRADE.

09:39.313 --> 09:42.180
ALL RIGHT,
MISS HOLLYWOOD.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.416
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
HAS TAKEN PITY ON YOU.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.085
YOU MAY RETAKE
YOUR SEAT.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.153
YAY!

09:48.155 --> 09:50.155
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MRS. SNOTGRASS.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.059
EXCUSE ME?

09:54.061 --> 09:56.328
Students:
OOH!

09:58.098 --> 10:00.131
( clears throat )

10:00.133 --> 10:03.101
"I HAVE NO ONE
TO BLAME BUT MYSELF."

10:08.141 --> 10:09.674
ALL RIGHT, JOEY.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.208
COME ON OUT AND SHOW ME
YOUR JOCK LOOK.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.448
WANNA SEE MY GUNS?

10:18.352 --> 10:20.218
HEY, JOEY.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.220
YOUR ARMS ACTUALLY HAVE
PRETTY GOOD DEFINITION.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.289
THANK YOU.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.357
IT'S FROM HOLDING UP
ALL MY MEDALS ON
MY STARFLEET OUTFIT.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.060
I KNOW IT'S A BIT
OF AN UPHILL BATTLE

10:29.062 --> 10:30.362
TRYING TO TURN JOEY
INTO A JOCK,

10:30.364 --> 10:32.297
BUT EVER SINCE
DIGGIE PACKED UP

10:32.299 --> 10:35.266
I'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO WASTE ON LOST CAUSES.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.401
AND I MEAN,
IT REALLY...

10:36.403 --> 10:39.137
DOESN'T GET
ANY MORE LOST THAN JOEY.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.171
( sighs )

10:40.173 --> 10:42.107
SWEET, SIMPLE JOEY.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.144
SO, NOW IT'S TIME
TO WORK ON YOUR JOCK WALK.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.379
SHOW ME HOW
YOU WALK TO CLASS. GO.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.384
OKAY.

10:52.386 --> 10:55.120
OKAY, EH...
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:55.122 --> 10:57.155
LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE, MAYBE,
RUNNING AWAY FROM SOMEONE.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.258
RUNNING AWAY?

11:00.259 --> 11:03.360
I'M RUNNING TO MRS. REIFSNIDER'S
GERMAN CLASS.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.330
FIRST ONE THERE
GETS STRUDEL.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.734
( clears throat )
ALL RIGHT.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.302
SO A JOCK WALKS
WITH SWAGGER,
CONFIDENCE.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.105
NEVER IN A HURRY.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.273
NOTHING STARTS...

11:15.275 --> 11:17.175
UNTIL THE JOCK
GETS THERE. SO...

11:17.177 --> 11:18.376
( exhales )

11:18.378 --> 11:20.211
WATCH ME.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.115
S'UP?

11:25.118 --> 11:26.668
NOW...

11:26.669 --> 11:28.219
YOU CAN ADD A QUARTER SMILE
OR A HALF SMILE,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.155
BUT NEVER A FULL SMILE.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.289
START OVER THERE.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.233
S'UP?
( laughs )

11:43.170 --> 11:44.302
HOW'D I DO?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.371
UM... WELL,
IF THE GOAL

11:46.373 --> 11:48.206
WAS SLOW MOTION
SERIAL KILLER,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.241
I THINK YOUR MISSION
WAS ACCOMPLISHED.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.311
OKAY, NOW WE ARE ON TO
JOCK SPEAK.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.346
( exhales )

11:55.348 --> 11:57.248
YOU GOING TO THE GAME
THIS WEEKEND, BRAH?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.383
- NOPE. SUPER BUSY.
- YEAH.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.152
I'M WORKING
ON A CHEM PROJECT

12:01.154 --> 12:02.520
THAT IS QUITE
A PICKLE!

12:04.391 --> 12:06.224
I KNEW THAT WAS WRONG
AS SOON AS I SAID IT.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.325
YEAH.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.295
SO I WAS THINKING

12:10.297 --> 12:13.131
I'D SWITCH
FROM A 2-3 ZONE

12:13.133 --> 12:16.201
TO MORE
OF A MAN-TO-MAN PRESS.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.169
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:18.171 --> 12:19.370
YOU'RE THE KING.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.441
DO WHATCHA GOTTA DO, JACK.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.379
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WIVES
TUNE THEIR HUSBANDS OUT.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.216
HOW DID I GET SO LUCKY?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.251
OOH, I WAS DEALT
A GREAT HAND.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.120
THANKS, HONEY.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.124
SO?

12:39.126 --> 12:41.326
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY
OF SIXTH GRADE?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.211
OH, IT WAS
SO GREAT!

12:43.212 --> 12:45.095
I TAUGHT ALL OF THE GIRLS
HOW TO TAKE A PROPER SELFIE.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.432
- OH.
- I WAS GOALIE
IN CRAB SOCCER.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.400
AND THEN AT THE END
OF THE DAY

12:49.402 --> 12:52.137
ALL OF THE KIDS
RALLIED TOGETHER
AND GAVE ME A BIG HUG.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.271
OH!

13:01.348 --> 13:03.248
( screams )

13:04.151 --> 13:05.784
WHAT?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.418
NOTHING. I JUST WISH
WE KNEW SOMEONE

13:07.420 --> 13:09.320
WHO COULD TELL
THE REST OF US
WHAT TO DO

13:09.322 --> 13:11.422
ON THIS THEATER
AND ACTING PROJECT.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.059
OOH! I PLAYED
LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE

13:15.061 --> 13:17.262
AT MY MOM'S CO-OP
PRODUCTION.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.236
UH, I MEAN,

13:25.238 --> 13:28.139
HUH, IT'S A CONUNDRUM.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.177
I WAS THINKING
WE COULD DO A SCENE

13:32.179 --> 13:33.411
FROM  <i> ROMEO AND JULIET.</i>

13:33.413 --> 13:35.113
GENIUS!

13:35.115 --> 13:37.248
LEAPING LIZARDS!

13:38.385 --> 13:41.119
YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH TO BE
A SEVENTH GRADER.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.187
STOP.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.389
I KNEW THEY WERE
MANIPULATING ME,

13:44.391 --> 13:46.090
BUT I DIDN'T CARE.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.293
I JUST WANTED TO BLOW
SNODGRASS AWAY.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.196
AND HONESTLY, IF THAT WAS
THE BEST PERFORMANCE
THEY COULD PUT ON,

13:51.198 --> 13:53.264
I WAS BETTER OFF
DOING IT MYSELF.
( laughs )

13:57.204 --> 13:58.269
S'UP?

13:59.206 --> 14:00.238
S'UP?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.340
S'UP?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.209
YOU KNOW, JUST TAKING
MY SWEET TIME.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.177
I'M A JOCK. NOTHING STARTS
UNTIL I GET THERE.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.245
( clicks tongue )

14:08.181 --> 14:10.215
OH, HEY, BRAH--
I MEAN...

14:10.217 --> 14:12.350
GRAH--
I MEAN...
( laughs )

14:13.286 --> 14:15.153
HEY, KENNEDY.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.088
HEY, JOEY.
WHAT'S UP?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.189
OH, YOU KNOW,
JUST CHILLIN',

14:18.191 --> 14:19.357
BASKETBALL DRILLIN'.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.391
JOCK STUFF.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.360
JOCKING OUT.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.395
WE SHOULD, EH...

14:24.397 --> 14:26.431
WE SHOULD CHITTY-CHITTY
HANG-HANG.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.133
I'D LOVE TO.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

14:29.135 --> 14:31.069
WE CAN WATCH
THE GAME TOGETHER
AT YOUR PLACE.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.305
OH, RIGHT.
THAT BIG SPORTS BALL...

14:34.307 --> 14:36.374
GAME.
( laughs )

14:36.376 --> 14:38.309
WHY WOULD YOU--
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO WATCH THAT?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.411
ISN'T THIS...
GAME ENOUGH RIGHT HERE?

14:40.413 --> 14:42.380
( giggles )
I'LL BE OVER FOR TIP OFF.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.514
OH, OKAY. YEAH.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.152
HEY!
HOW'D IT GO?

14:48.154 --> 14:49.420
TERRIBLE!
KENNEDY WANTS TO WATCH

14:49.422 --> 14:51.222
THE BIG GAME
AT OUR HOUSE TONIGHT

14:51.224 --> 14:53.258
AND I'VE ALREADY USED UP
ALL THE SPORTY WORDS I KNOW.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.094
I CAN'T DO THIS!
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

14:56.096 --> 14:58.196
OKAY. WELL, I THINK
THE FIRST THING
YOU'RE GONNA DO

14:58.198 --> 15:01.132
IS STOP SCREAMING
IN THAT WHINY,
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.218
( high-pitched )
SORRY!

15:03.219 --> 15:05.303
( deep voice )
I CAN'T DO THIS!
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

15:08.408 --> 15:11.175
( sparse applause )

15:11.177 --> 15:12.443
WELL...

15:12.445 --> 15:15.313
THANK YOU, BOBBY, LINDSAY,
JENNY, MARK,

15:15.315 --> 15:18.116
FOR TURNING
<i>A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM</i>

15:18.118 --> 15:19.484
INTO A MIDAFTERNOON
NIGHTMARE.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.154
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S SEE.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.156
PARKER, REGGIE,
EVAN...

15:25.158 --> 15:26.524
LIV,
YOU'RE UP.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.296
WE HOPE YOU ENJOY
<i>ROMEO AND JULIET.</i>

15:31.298 --> 15:33.331
KINDLY SILENCE
ALL DEVICES.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.334
- I'M OFF THE GRID.
- ( phone buzzes )

15:36.336 --> 15:38.303
MY MOM'S GONNA
FREAK OUT.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.175
O ROMEO, ROMEO!

15:44.177 --> 15:46.210
WHEREFORE ART THOU ROMEO?

15:49.416 --> 15:53.151
WITH LOVE'S LIGHT WINGS
DID I O'ER-PERCH THESE WALLS.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.321
A THOUSAND TIMES
GOOD NIGHT!

15:56.323 --> 16:00.224
A THOUSAND TIMES THE WORSE,
TO WANT THY LIGHT.

16:01.394 --> 16:05.129
GOOD NIGHT, GOOD NIGHT!
PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW,

16:05.131 --> 16:08.299
THAT I SHALL SAY GOOD NIGHT
TILL IT BE MORROW.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.239
NAILED IT!

16:15.241 --> 16:17.275
THEY SAY PLAYING
TWO PARTS IS TOUGH, BUT...

16:17.277 --> 16:19.744
WHATEVER.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.212
- LIV, THAT WAS
EXCEPTIONAL.
- THANK YOU.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.448
I'M GIVING
THE GROUP AN F.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.416
All:
WHAT?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.418
THE POINT
OF A GROUP EXERCISE

16:27.420 --> 16:30.221
IS FOR THE GROUP
TO WORK ON THE PRESENTATION

16:30.223 --> 16:32.156
- AS A GROUP.
- WHA...

16:32.158 --> 16:34.392
LIV DID EVERYTHING.
ALL YOU BOYS DID
WAS STAND THERE.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.261
YOU THINK THAT CURTAIN
JUST OPENED ITSELF?

16:38.932 --> 16:41.232
PLEASE, MRS. SNODGRASS,
DON'T BLAME THEM.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.433
THIS WAS
ALL MY FAULT.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.169
OH, I'M SORRY.
ALL MY GRADES ARE FINAL.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.471
I FEEL FLUSHED.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.539
I THINK I'M
GONNA FAINT.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.609
OKAY...

16:51.610 --> 16:53.310
PLEASE, GIVE US
ANOTHER CHANCE.

16:53.313 --> 16:57.215
I MEAN, DON'T YOU ALWAYS SAY,
"LOOK FOR THE TEACHABLE MOMENT"?

16:57.951 --> 17:00.952
OH, I DO ALWAYS SAY THAT.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.321
FINE, ONE MORE CHANCE.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.257
MAKE IT WORK,
OR SUMMER SCHOOL
FOR ALL OF YOU.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.077
AND FAIR WARNING...

17:09.078 --> 17:10.962
I'M NOT AS EASYGOING
IN THE SUMMER.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.432
I CAN'T BE HERE
OVER THE SUMMER.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.300
JULY'S WHEN MOTHER PROMISED

17:16.302 --> 17:18.403
I COULD FINALLY
WATCH TELEVISION.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.371
FIX THIS, WOMAN!

17:26.346 --> 17:28.379
ALL RIGHT, LIV,
WHAT DO WE DO?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.481
UH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.316
WE ARE NOT PUTTING
ALL OF THIS ON ME AGAIN.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.985
<i>WE'RE NOT DOING</i>
<i>ANY OF THIS,</i>

17:33.987 --> 17:35.420
"WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING, "

17:35.422 --> 17:37.388
"HUH, IT'S A CONUNDRUM"
STUFF AGAIN.

17:38.358 --> 17:42.326
NO, SEE, MRS. SNODGRASS SAID
THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER
AS A GROUP.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.262
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU GUYS CAN ROCK
THAT SHAKESPEARE STUFF

17:44.264 --> 17:45.363
AT LEAST AS HARD
AS I DID, SO...

17:45.365 --> 17:47.331
WHO'S GOT AN IDEA?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.000
OOH, I'VE GOT AN IDEA!

17:49.002 --> 17:51.002
YES! BRILLIANT.
REGGIE, WHAT'S YOUR IDEA?

17:51.004 --> 17:53.371
I THINK WE SHOULD DO
WHAT YOU SAY.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.439
HA!

17:55.942 --> 17:58.943
YOU'RE NOT
UNDERSTANDING THIS
AT ALL.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.345
I AM NOT, DOCTOR P.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.916
PERHAPS WE SHOULD WORK
AS A UNIT

18:04.918 --> 18:08.419
AND COME UP WITH
A PRESENTATION THAT SHOWCASES
ALL OF OUR TALENTS.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.987
OOH!

18:09.989 --> 18:11.389
LET'S DO WHAT HE SAID.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.492
SERIOUSLY?

18:14.494 --> 18:17.261
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE
SUCH A LONG NIGHT.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.397
BETTER NOT BE.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.032
MY BEDTIME'S 5:30.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.337
- OHH, YES!
-  <i> ( cheering on TV )</i>

18:26.339 --> 18:28.272
- POINT-- GOAL! HA!
- ( laughs )

18:28.274 --> 18:29.307
YEAH.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.309
( sighs )

18:31.310 --> 18:33.310
IT'S SUCH A GREAT GAME.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?

18:34.414 --> 18:36.948
UH...

18:36.950 --> 18:39.317
THEY WANT LEBRON...

18:39.319 --> 18:40.918
ON THE WING.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.055
<i>( Joey speaks )</i>

18:44.057 --> 18:45.957
OH.
( mumbles )

18:45.959 --> 18:49.427
WE HAD PARKER SWIPE THE CHIP
FROM MOM'S OMNI-SPECS

18:49.429 --> 18:51.496
AND INSTALL IT
INTO MY GLASSES

18:51.498 --> 18:54.065
SO MADDIE COULD TELL ME
WHAT TO SAY.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.501
RIGHT, 'CAUSE HE REALLY
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
ABOUT SPORTS...

18:56.503 --> 18:59.504
OR GIRLS,
OR LIFE, OR...

18:59.506 --> 19:02.106
ANYTHING OTHER THAN
SLAYING PRETEND DRAGONS.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.408
OKAY, THE DAY THE DRAGONS
COME BACK,

19:04.410 --> 19:08.079
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE
A LEVEL-90 NECROMANCER

19:08.081 --> 19:10.982
- IN YOUR HOUSE.
- NO, I WILL NEVER BE GLAD.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.484
OH, OH, LEBRON IS
MONEY FROM THERE.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.488
YOU CAN'T STOP HIM.
YOU CAN ONLY HOPE
TO CONTAIN HIM.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.925
WOW, YOU REALLY KNOW
YOUR STUFF.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.094
YEAH, I DO.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.030
UH, NO, HE DOESN'T.
( chuckles, snorts )

19:26.032 --> 19:29.333
OH... OH.
TAKE IT TO THE HOLE.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.469
- AND BOOM GOES
THE DYNAMITE!
- YES!

19:31.471 --> 19:33.471
EXCLAMATION POINT!

19:36.109 --> 19:38.075
( sighs )
HEY, HONEY.

19:38.077 --> 19:41.345
HEY, MOM.
I THOUGHT IT WAS
MAHJONG NIGHT.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.381
OH, WELL, IT IS.
BUT I WAS HOPING FOR

19:43.383 --> 19:46.384
A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE,
AND THE CHIP IS MISSING
FROM MY OMNI-SPECS.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.921
WOW! THAT'S SO WEIRD.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.989
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO LOOK FOR THAT THING...

19:51.991 --> 19:54.358
SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S
NOT HERE OR THE LIVING ROOM.

19:56.129 --> 19:59.096
MADDIE ROONEY,
DID YOU STEAL THE OMNI
FROM MY SPECS?

20:00.066 --> 20:01.933
OKAY, SO I PUT IT IN
JOEY'S GLASSES TO HELP HIM

20:01.935 --> 20:03.134
PRETEND TO BE A JOCK
TO GET A GIRL.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.502
MADDIE!

20:05.438 --> 20:07.371
I'M HAVING SUCH
A GREAT TIME TONIGHT.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.477

Joseph Rooney,
you are a handsome,
wonderful boy

20:15.014 --> 20:17.448

without trickery!

20:18.451 --> 20:21.452
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- UM, UH, SOMETHING'S
IN MY EYE,

20:21.454 --> 20:24.455
AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT
TO BE OUT OF MY EYE!

20:24.457 --> 20:25.923
- ( beeping )
- MOM, STOP.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.391
THE CAMERA MODE IS
OVERLOADING THE CIRCUIT.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.126
I WANT HIM TO
BELIEVE IN HIMSELF!

20:29.128 --> 20:30.494
MOM!

20:32.465 --> 20:34.098
JOEY, YOU'RE SMOKING.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.133
OOH, THANKS, LIL' MAMA.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.002
YOU'RE PRETTY SMOKING
YOURSELF.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.471

20:53.419 --> 20:56.187
YOU'RE NOT REALLY A JOCK,
ARE YOU?

20:56.189 --> 20:57.555
WHAT GAVE IT AWAY?

20:59.025 --> 21:01.559
I WAS THINKING IT WAS
PROBABLY EVERYTHING.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.747
WHY'D YOU LIE TO ME?

21:05.748 --> 21:07.999
I'M SORRY.
I JUST THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD
GET YOU TO HANG OUT WITH ME,

21:08.001 --> 21:09.200
YOU WOULD LIKE
THE REAL JOEY.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.937
OKAY, THAT'S
REALLY MESSED UP,

21:12.939 --> 21:15.172
BUT KIND OF CUTE.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.941
