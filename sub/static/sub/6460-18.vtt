for "happy"?

00:05.439 --> 00:09.341
And it's not my first wife,
Helen.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.611
I was gonna suggest "drunk."

00:12.613 --> 00:14.680
Maybe 'cause I am.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.682
Hey, everybody!

00:20.320 --> 00:21.553
Hey.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.189
Guess what I have
under my coat.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.726
And it's not ice cream sundaes
like last time.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.697
It's my baby bump!

00:33.133 --> 00:35.634
Aw, Sophie, you're showing!

00:35.636 --> 00:38.570
And this time, it's not
either of your nipples.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.407
Ah, look!
Only four months.

00:41.409 --> 00:45.177
And I'm already
approaching Kardashian.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.613
And that's quoting the doctor.

00:47.615 --> 00:48.814
Impressive.

00:48.816 --> 00:52.785
You may have a North, South,
East, and West in there.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.621
The baby really kicks.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.489
So it's either gonna be
a soccer player

00:57.491 --> 01:00.692
or a Los Angeles policeman.

Hey, Han, what do you think

baby bump?

01:07.201 --> 01:10.636

we never comment on two things:

Last time you were smiling,
I almost lost an ear.

02:08.229 --> 02:11.230
Well, my Hollywood money
has finally arrived,

02:11.232 --> 02:13.165

Max and I want to

Come on, Han, it won't affect

is use the dish room--

home of two of the three
original strands of E. coli.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.183
It's a no.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.018
My therapist said
this had to be the year

02:33.020 --> 02:37.022
of standing up for myself
and cutting out soda.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.892
All right, well go ahead,
stand up.

02:41.694 --> 02:45.364
But because I would like to see
you make someone else miserable,

02:45.366 --> 02:47.799
I know a real estate agent
that could help you two

02:47.801 --> 02:49.034

02:49.036 --> 02:53.272
Did you say
"real estate Asian"?

02:53.274 --> 02:56.375
Her name is Evie,
and I know her from my church.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.144
And let's just say
she's been angling

02:59.146 --> 03:01.847
for what I've got dangling.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.886
Your keys?

03:07.888 --> 03:11.190
She likes me, you shrews!

03:11.192 --> 03:13.625
Okay, well that's what we get
for being nice.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.127
So back to the dessert bar,

03:15.129 --> 03:17.429

you of those cool stools?

03:17.431 --> 03:20.032
I saw the subject heading
was "cool stools,"

No, why do you still

03:35.649 --> 03:37.549

03:51.165 --> 03:53.865
