03:36.423 --> 03:39.292
Look, she already
doesn't like it here, Beth.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.843
You think telling her,
"Hey, we all had a little chat

03:41.868 --> 03:43.672

03:43.696 --> 03:45.375

04:04.606 --> 04:05.875
Look, Annie scrapes her knee,

04:05.900 --> 04:07.980
and she still goes to you first
for the boo-boo kiss.

04:08.823 --> 04:11.281
Are we seriously having a
conversation right now

04:11.306 --> 04:13.734
about the order of
Annie's boo-boo kisses?

04:13.759 --> 04:15.570
May I take the lead here? Please?

04:17.641 --> 04:19.834
I just want her to feel
like she fits in first

04:19.860 --> 04:22.601

that may alienate her even more.

04:23.445 --> 04:24.515
And who knows?

04:24.540 --> 04:25.986
Maybe when she's more
comfortable with us,

04:26.010 --> 04:27.644
she may want to wash it herself.

04:29.423 --> 04:30.437

08:36.712 --> 08:38.210
Until two weeks ago.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.796
I'm assuming you've been in
quite a bit of pain since then.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.904
Yeah, I tried taking painkillers
for a few days,

08:43.929 --> 08:45.329
but I didn't like the
way it made me feel.

08:45.353 --> 08:47.812
And rather than coming to see me
to get the knee looked at,

08:47.837 --> 08:50.781
- you decided to...
- Tough it out. Yeah.

08:51.633 --> 08:52.875
Uh, look, here's the thing.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.329
We're almost done with the movie, okay?

08:54.353 --> 08:56.210
So I really need to get
back to work next week

08:56.235 --> 08:58.304
so that I can finish my
last three scenes, so...

08:59.484 --> 09:01.364
...how do I do that?
How do we make that happen?

09:01.734 --> 09:03.688
Well, we can do a simple
arthroscopic surgery

09:03.712 --> 09:04.750
to remove the tear.

09:04.929 --> 09:07.390
Three small incisions,
in and out in an hour.

09:07.816 --> 09:09.484
Many patients walk the same day.

09:40.078 --> 09:41.859
KEVIN: <i>I itch everywhere, Grandma.</i>

09:41.884 --> 09:45.195
I even have chicken pox
in a place I can't talk about.

09:45.220 --> 09:46.382
(chuckles): Aw.

09:46.407 --> 09:48.421
You poor angel. Look at you.

09:48.446 --> 09:50.132
You must feel awful.

09:50.462 --> 09:53.430
Would presents from Grandma
make everyone feel better?

09:53.455 --> 09:55.289
- Hmm.
- (chuckles)

09:56.433 --> 09:57.929
Here we go.

09:58.504 --> 10:01.039
Hey, what is she doing here?
Did you invite her?

10:01.064 --> 10:03.799
No, I'm not a masochist, Jack.
I did not invite her.

10:03.824 --> 10:05.791
Two minutes in,
and she's already commenting

10:05.816 --> 10:07.049
on what a mess the house is.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.008
I mean, we have ten-year-old triplets.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.734
I don't know what she was expecting.

10:12.890 --> 10:14.101
What are we gonna do?

10:14.225 --> 10:15.383
Well, we can't put her in a car

10:15.407 --> 10:16.619
and send her back to Connecticut.

10:16.643 --> 10:18.835
- It's... No. No. We can't.
- Really?

10:18.860 --> 10:21.304
- It's snowing like crazy outside.
- (sighs, groans)

10:21.489 --> 10:24.125
Look, we're-we're just
gonna have to get through it.

10:24.150 --> 10:26.585
- (groans)
- Just don't let her bait you.

10:27.037 --> 10:28.570
I don't let her bait me.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.046
- Well, I beg to differ, Bunny.
- (exasperated grunt)

10:31.167 --> 10:32.967
I hate when she calls me Bunny.

10:32.992 --> 10:34.991
I don't even like bunnies.
Where does that come from?

10:35.015 --> 10:36.679
Says the woman that cannot be baited.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.828
Ha.

10:38.547 --> 10:40.179
Okay, look, hey, hey.

10:40.249 --> 10:43.406
What if a third set of hands

10:43.431 --> 10:45.132
is actually gonna be
helpful with the kids?

10:45.468 --> 10:48.031
(laughs) You're really
cute when you're dumb.

10:48.056 --> 10:49.046
Yeah?

10:49.071 --> 10:50.726
- Don't leave me alone with her.
- I know.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.047
- Come on.
- Remember when you wanted

10:52.071 --> 10:53.701
- to put that in the wedding vows?
- Yeah.

10:53.725 --> 10:55.023
JANET: Here you go.

10:56.319 --> 10:57.652
Little Mermaid?

10:57.677 --> 10:59.477
- Thanks, Grandma!
- Yeah.

11:01.351 --> 11:04.387
I think it's a little too small.

11:04.686 --> 11:06.789
You can use it as your goal dress.

11:06.814 --> 11:07.843
REBECCA: Mom.

11:08.913 --> 11:11.343
Sweetheart, no, no.
We'll return it for the right size.

11:11.368 --> 11:13.523
'Cause I'm sure that
Grandma kept the receipt.

11:14.268 --> 11:15.328
(quietly): Yeah.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.312
And I think that you should try out

11:19.337 --> 11:21.429
for your school team;
I think you'd be a natural.

11:21.978 --> 11:23.657
It's the third basketball
that she's given him.

11:23.681 --> 11:24.812
- You realize that?
- I know.

11:25.464 --> 11:27.367
I don't really play, Grandma, but...

11:28.432 --> 11:30.625
I guess I could try if
you really want me to.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.351
Well, everyone should have something

11:32.376 --> 11:33.835
that they're really good at.

RANDALL: You're gonna
love bowling, Deja.

11:38.009 --> 11:39.757
Now, we are a family
that falls on two sides

11:39.782 --> 11:41.000
of the lane bumper debate.

11:41.025 --> 11:42.820
I say, hey, they make us all better.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.227
Beth would disagree with that,

11:44.251 --> 11:46.062
- but Beth ain't here, now, is she?
- (laughs)

11:46.249 --> 11:47.416
Hey, let's take our shoes off

11:47.441 --> 11:49.273
so we'll be ready to give
them to the cashier.

11:49.452 --> 11:51.445
I'm not giving somebody my shoes.

11:51.804 --> 11:53.585
But we have to rent
bowling shoes, Deja.

11:53.968 --> 11:56.448
It's okay... They'll give you yours back
as soon as we're done.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.808
Why would I want to wear
somebody else's gross shoes?

11:58.833 --> 11:59.946
- No, no, don't worry.
- Daddy,

11:59.970 --> 12:01.860
- I don't want to rent shoes, either.
- Annie, please, not now.

12:01.884 --> 12:03.898
- Dad, come on, it's our turn to go.
- Yeah, w...

12:03.977 --> 12:05.570
Okay, hey, uh...

12:06.000 --> 12:08.350
how about I ask them if you
can bowl in your socks?

12:08.375 --> 12:10.195
- I'm not wearing socks.
- You're not...

nastier than her hair.

12:13.882 --> 12:15.034

- Nothing.
- No, I heard you.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.102
- I wasn't talking to you.
- If you got something to say,

12:19.126 --> 12:20.426
you could say it to my face.

12:20.731 --> 12:21.976
Okay. Fine.

12:22.207 --> 12:23.656
Your hair's nasty.

- Hey, don't touch her.

I'm sorry about that, man.
She shouldn't have done that.

- No, what the hell is your problem?
- Come on, girls.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.743
- Let's go.
- No, no, no, you don't just walk away.

12:31.767 --> 12:32.976
She needs to apologize.

12:33.001 --> 12:34.902
Excuse me, sir, would
you back up, please?

12:36.265 --> 12:37.429
Are you all right, Maya?

12:37.529 --> 12:40.312
- Hmm? She hit you hard?
- She didn't hit her.

12:40.372 --> 12:42.071
Okay? Your daughter was
being a frickin' bully.

Don't blame my daughter because
you can't control yours.

Bro, I think you need
to watch your tone.

- No, brah, I heard you.

12:47.051 --> 12:48.679
You really need to back up right now.

Look, if your daughter can't
keep her hands to herself...

Yeah, no, you and me
both; We could live out

- Dude, she's a nurse.

It's manageable, you know,

14:19.454 --> 14:21.078
to... take these painkillers

14:21.103 --> 14:22.648
with food, so you want me to make you

- a quesadilla or something?
- No, no, no, I'm good.

14:24.475 --> 14:26.266
I'm not taking those things.
I took a couple of those

14:26.290 --> 14:28.679
when I first got injured,
they made my mind all fuzzy,

14:28.704 --> 14:30.235

sucker off right now.

- They were too hot.

14:54.196 --> 14:55.563
Everything's too hot.

14:56.039 --> 14:57.609
You said the medicine would help.

14:57.634 --> 15:00.469
Yeah, well, it's only been seven
minutes since you took it, pal.

15:00.494 --> 15:01.507
You got to give it time.

15:01.532 --> 15:03.063
It's gonna kick in and help, I promise.

15:03.087 --> 15:05.992
No, it won't!

Own that itch. Let me hear
your roar one more time.

Uh, please don't. Please don't.

Baby, stop.

16:06.490 --> 16:07.992

- Your internal meltdown

16:08.017 --> 16:09.851
is literally making the bed hot.

16:10.525 --> 16:12.234
Why did I think she'd like bowling?

16:13.061 --> 16:14.726
Well, who actually likes bowling?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.196
It was cool for a minute there
when <i>The Big Lebowski</i> came out,

16:17.220 --> 16:18.820
but that was, like, 20 years ago, right?

16:18.933 --> 16:21.109
I meant go to sleep, but okay.

16:21.403 --> 16:23.414
I was so sure I had
the right angle on this, Beth.

16:23.935 --> 16:26.531
We were gonna have fun,
and then she would feel good,

16:26.556 --> 16:27.812
and we could talk.

16:28.382 --> 16:30.742
And instead I just made things
a whole lot worse for her.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.117
Can't believe you were gonna throw down

16:34.142 --> 16:36.812
- with some jackass in bowling shoes.

16:36.837 --> 16:38.877

to you in the first place.

16:39.225 --> 16:40.960
You knew. Of course you knew.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.609
You got the hygiene talk on lock.

16:44.487 --> 16:47.898
Right up there with...
untangling necklaces

16:48.652 --> 16:50.648
and perfectly round scoops of ice cream.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.563
The trick is you just
have to run the scooper

16:52.587 --> 16:54.633
- under hot water first.
- I know what the trick is, Beth.

16:54.657 --> 16:56.945
I'm just wallowing. Okay, I'm done.

16:59.898 --> 17:02.296
I'm sorry it didn't end up
the way you wanted it.

17:03.482 --> 17:04.710
You should talk to her.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.171
I will.

17:11.558 --> 17:13.007
- In the morning.
- Right.

17:14.478 --> 17:16.164
- Just let me hug you!
- (Kate screams)

17:16.189 --> 17:18.531
- I need to get sick!
- Leave me alone!

17:18.556 --> 17:20.772
Guys, enough! Guys! Stop!

17:21.053 --> 17:24.117
Hey, Randall, there are germs
all over this house.

17:24.324 --> 17:27.265
You <i>will</i> get sick, you
just have to be patient, okay?

17:27.290 --> 17:29.758
Why don't you go upstairs
and finish your project

17:29.783 --> 17:31.476
- before you get sick?
- Good idea.

17:31.658 --> 17:33.170
- Whoa. Sorry, Grandma.
- Okay.

17:33.195 --> 17:34.809
Wait, do you want to
see my Rube Goldberg

17:34.834 --> 17:36.165
machine I'm building
for the science fair?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.617
You knock over some dominoes,

17:37.642 --> 17:40.445
and then a race car goes down
a slide and hits a marble.

17:40.470 --> 17:42.008
And then I haven't
figured out the middle yet,

17:42.032 --> 17:44.570
but by the end, a marker draws
a line on a piece of paper.

17:44.930 --> 17:48.031
Right. Well, why don't you
show me when it works.

17:51.343 --> 17:53.359
Did you sauté the onions first?

17:53.384 --> 17:55.875
- I did.
- How much thyme did you add?

17:55.900 --> 17:58.211
- 'Cause you don't need more than a...
- I did half a tablespoon.

17:58.235 --> 17:59.795
Well, you're gonna need more than that.

18:00.930 --> 18:02.445
Do you want to make the soup, Mom?

18:03.523 --> 18:04.554
- Sure.
- Yeah?

18:04.579 --> 18:06.513
- I'm more than happy to help.
- Thank you.

18:06.538 --> 18:07.710
Go for it.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.523
- I like your soup best, Mom.
- Thank you.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.515
Well, your mother actually learned

18:13.540 --> 18:15.109
how to make this from me.

18:15.143 --> 18:17.234
I can teach you, too, if you want.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.507
A woman should know how to
cook if she wants to have

18:19.532 --> 18:21.210
a husband and children of her own.

18:21.235 --> 18:22.890
- She's ten, Mom.
- Well, Lord knows

18:22.915 --> 18:25.390
I wasn't the prettiest girl
in Erie, Pennsylvania,

18:25.415 --> 18:27.726
but I somehow roped your father

18:27.751 --> 18:30.820
with the best pot roast and
green bean casserole in town.

18:30.845 --> 18:32.976
- Did your mom teach you?
- Yeah, she did.

18:33.001 --> 18:34.368
But this recipe right here

18:34.393 --> 18:36.961
actually comes from a maid that we had

18:36.986 --> 18:39.296
- when your mother was a little girl.
- You had a maid?

18:39.321 --> 18:41.734
Mm-hmm. A lovely black woman named Dora.

18:42.854 --> 18:44.688
Of course, I was always
correcting her English,

18:44.712 --> 18:47.437
so that you girls didn't start
speaking like street kids.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.995
- Jack? Where are you?
- Dad's got a fever, too.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.742
- What? -Yeah, it-it... it just hit me.
- JANET: Oh, God.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.187
I thought you said you'd
had the chickenpox before.

18:57.212 --> 18:59.484
- No, I did. I did, I <i>think.</i>

18:59.509 --> 19:00.742
Probably measles.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.304
- Jack.
- Oh, crap.

19:03.329 --> 19:05.363
Why don't you go upstairs
and go to bed, Jack.

19:05.388 --> 19:07.750
We got everything
under control here without you.

19:07.775 --> 19:08.842
Don't we, Bunny?

19:20.094 --> 19:21.468
You going somewhere?

19:23.453 --> 19:25.796
I pushed a girl, so you're
kicking me out, right?

19:26.123 --> 19:28.148
You spent the whole night thinking that?

19:28.173 --> 19:30.156
We're not kicking you out, Deja.

19:30.181 --> 19:31.273
Honey, sit.

19:32.070 --> 19:33.734
Come on, Deja, bag down.

19:33.759 --> 19:35.132
- Please, sit.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.078
You're right.

19:41.335 --> 19:43.390
We don't push other people in our house.

19:45.665 --> 19:47.867
You push somebody again,
and you'll be grounded.

19:49.128 --> 19:50.898
But I hope it doesn't happen again.

19:53.617 --> 19:54.757
Is that it, then?

19:57.608 --> 19:58.609
Um...

19:59.734 --> 20:00.804
you know...

20:01.408 --> 20:05.265
I grew up with three
very opinionated sisters

20:05.290 --> 20:07.890
and one <i>very</i> opinionated mother.

20:09.421 --> 20:11.132
Fights, arguments,

20:11.157 --> 20:12.921
cold shoulders, yelling matches...

20:12.946 --> 20:16.125
You name it, the Clarke
women did not play.

20:16.699 --> 20:18.934
But no matter who wasn't talking to who,

20:18.991 --> 20:23.093
or who stole whose favorite
tube of candy apple lipstick,

20:23.953 --> 20:26.335
we always came together
to do each other's hair.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.414
Because my mom believed...
Still believes...

20:31.784 --> 20:34.992
That... how you present
yourself on the outside

20:35.272 --> 20:37.187
reflects how you feel on the inside.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.625
Look, I don't know why you're
not washing your hair, Deja.

20:42.505 --> 20:45.015
But I do know we have to
get it taken care of.

20:48.536 --> 20:50.671
So, if you don't want to do it yourself,

20:50.696 --> 20:53.093
I'm happy to take you
to my salon. I love it there.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.885
It's really nice,

20:54.910 --> 20:57.378
and I spend way too much money there,

20:57.403 --> 20:59.140
and it's worth every damn penny.

21:02.864 --> 21:04.601
Let me know what you decide, okay?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.085
In the meantime,

21:10.456 --> 21:12.924
you can just go ahead and unpack.

21:16.726 --> 21:18.227
Will you do my hair?

- Hey. Uh, it's from the producers.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Just go ahead and, uh, put that
on the counter there.

21:28.493 --> 21:30.602
Look at all that kiwi on
a stick. You know I always say

21:30.626 --> 21:32.005
you can never have
enough kiwi on a stick.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.648
(chuckles) They, uh, wanted
to wish you a speedy recovery.

21:34.673 --> 21:36.641
- Well, that's nice.
- I also have a hard copy

21:36.666 --> 21:38.000
of the revised script pages.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.976
Okay. Thank you.

21:40.735 --> 21:44.070
Cool. Well, I will, uh...
I'll see you in a few days.

Yeah, I'm excited
about the gig tomorrow, too.

22:09.687 --> 22:11.997
Yeah. I-I just talked to Ms. Silver.

Don't worry. I won't pull
too hard. I promise.

These areas where the hair doesn't grow.

What she has is called alopecia.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.460
- Have you ever heard of that before?
- No.

22:57.725 --> 22:59.820
It's not that uncommon in black hair.

Some people are just born with it.

Kevin, Kate and Randall. Okay?

- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired.

I mean, since I've been here,

Yeah. Never better, actually.

us for the holidays.

- Okay.

I'm allowed to worry.

What? Nothing.

25:39.173 --> 25:40.195
Okay.

25:41.109 --> 25:43.085

want to talk about this?

25:43.110 --> 25:44.414
Um...

25:46.144 --> 25:47.796
Do you want to know why

25:47.821 --> 25:49.742
we don't come home
for the holidays anymore?

25:49.839 --> 25:51.750
It's because of you.

25:55.315 --> 25:57.817
You constantly criticize my family.

25:57.842 --> 25:59.810
I am not a good enough cook.

25:59.835 --> 26:01.302
I don't clean well enough.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.828
Uh, Jack doesn't provide.

26:04.129 --> 26:06.997
You're gonna most certainly
give Kate a complex about food.

26:07.022 --> 26:09.632
And Kevin is gonna think that his only

26:09.809 --> 26:11.943
value in life comes from how he looks.

26:11.968 --> 26:13.769
And all of that is fine.

26:13.794 --> 26:16.968
All of that I can sort of
explain away to the kids, but...

26:18.615 --> 26:19.849
(sighs)

26:26.037 --> 26:27.531
But Randall...

26:29.337 --> 26:33.307
tries so hard to get you to like him.

26:33.685 --> 26:36.570
And, honestly,

26:37.467 --> 26:39.007
I've always wondered if the reason

26:39.032 --> 26:41.953
that you never bonded with him
was because he was adopted.

26:42.881 --> 26:45.492
But you've made it alarmingly clear

26:46.432 --> 26:48.851
that it's because he's black.

26:51.250 --> 26:53.851
That is an appalling thing
for you to say.

26:53.876 --> 26:55.455
You know, just 'cause
he's black doesn't mean

26:55.479 --> 26:56.976
that he likes basketball.

26:57.001 --> 26:59.695
He likes football,
like the rest of us, okay?

27:00.309 --> 27:01.960
And you got to stop constantly

27:01.985 --> 27:03.679
separating him from Kevin and Kate.

27:03.704 --> 27:05.304
They're all my kids, okay?

27:05.329 --> 27:07.898
I'm sorry, I call them "the twins."

27:08.062 --> 27:09.262
That's what they are.

27:09.287 --> 27:12.539
And Dora, our maid Dora,
she wasn't just a child

27:12.564 --> 27:14.835
that you had to train
how to speak, she wasn't.

27:14.860 --> 27:18.445
She was a 50-year-old woman
who had four kids of her own.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.054
I can't talk to you when
you're being hysterical.

27:24.181 --> 27:26.315
And St. Mary's, right?

27:26.490 --> 27:29.460
We went to St. Mary's my whole
life, and then suddenly at 16,

27:29.485 --> 27:33.155
we switched churches because
we got a pastor from Ghana.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.007
Oh, for God's sakes,
I couldn't understand

27:35.032 --> 27:37.296
the man's accent, Rebecca.

27:39.599 --> 27:41.046
When the snow is gone,

27:42.790 --> 27:44.054
I want you gone, too.

27:45.562 --> 27:48.460
'Cause I will not expose Randall
to any more of this crap.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.156
What are you talking about?

27:52.037 --> 27:53.687
You're racist, Mom.

27:53.790 --> 27:55.015
You're a racist.

27:59.578 --> 28:00.625
Sweetheart.

28:01.631 --> 28:04.289
(sighs) Sweetheart, I thought
that you were upstairs.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.195
I got my first chicken pock.

28:09.629 --> 28:11.429
Okay. All right.

28:11.454 --> 28:12.695
Um... (sniffles)

28:14.020 --> 28:15.625
Uh, let's take you back upstairs

28:15.650 --> 28:17.835
and I'll put some
calamine lotion on, okay?

28:23.119 --> 28:25.085
TOBY: Hey, babe have you seen my...

28:25.296 --> 28:27.764

28:28.335 --> 28:30.015
Wow. That looks great.

28:30.289 --> 28:31.914

28:32.085 --> 28:33.210
Yeah, you did.

28:34.203 --> 28:37.467
Hey. You set a goal
and you made a goal,

28:37.492 --> 28:39.092
so now is the part
where you get excited.

28:39.406 --> 28:40.554
What's going on with you?

28:41.625 --> 28:43.647
Nothing. Can you just unzip me?

28:43.743 --> 28:46.245
I have to meet my pianist for rehearsal.

28:49.014 --> 28:50.015
Yeah.

28:55.578 --> 28:57.335
How can Grandma be racist?

28:57.762 --> 29:00.467
She never says anything mean
to me about being black.

29:00.492 --> 29:03.109
Yeah, that's-that's not always
how racism works, kiddo.

29:03.398 --> 29:07.213
REBECCA: Yeah. Do you remember
how we were talking about

29:07.238 --> 29:08.772
what Martin Luther King Day means?

29:09.296 --> 29:12.656
Someone shot him because he wanted
to get black people equal rights.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.203
- Did Grandma shoot him?!
- No, no, no, no, no. Grandma... mm.

29:17.115 --> 29:20.750
Look, you know how sometimes

29:20.785 --> 29:24.087
Mom gets really mad at me
and she says some things

29:24.122 --> 29:27.457
that... aren't really nice

29:27.492 --> 29:29.039
but she makes it sound nice?

29:29.064 --> 29:32.429
Like, "Jack, I love when you leave

29:32.463 --> 29:34.593
your muddy boots in the
middle of the living room."

29:35.851 --> 29:36.945
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:36.970 --> 29:39.578
So racism can sometimes be like that.

29:40.138 --> 29:42.828
You know, people don't
actually say bad things

29:42.853 --> 29:44.365
to people that are different than them.

29:44.389 --> 29:47.024
- What they say sounds fine...
- REBECCA: Mm.

29:47.062 --> 29:50.718
But there's this mean
undertone to it, you know?

29:56.602 --> 29:58.375
I think I'm gonna go to bed now.

30:05.667 --> 30:06.828
(sighs)

30:07.560 --> 30:09.828
I mean, I said alopecia, and it was like

30:09.853 --> 30:12.521
no one had ever talked
to her about it before.

30:14.320 --> 30:17.164
I honestly don't know what
I would've done in that moment.

30:18.820 --> 30:20.577
They come to me for the boo-boo kiss,

30:20.611 --> 30:22.844
but they go to you for the
Band-Aid and the boo-boo song.

30:22.868 --> 30:25.070
I don't know anyone else
who has a three-verse song

30:25.095 --> 30:28.101
about how antibiotic ointment
can help them heal faster.

30:28.126 --> 30:31.453
♪ And prevent an infection disaster. ♪

30:32.123 --> 30:33.223
That's the...

30:33.437 --> 30:34.851
They need the both of us.

30:35.632 --> 30:37.070
We make a good team.

30:39.895 --> 30:41.763
Nope. We were right the first time.

30:46.131 --> 30:47.273
(knock on door)

30:49.770 --> 30:51.601
Dang, girl.

30:52.431 --> 30:53.593
You look really cool.

30:53.665 --> 30:55.453
Alicia Keys cool.

30:56.193 --> 30:57.289
She's old.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.656
(laughs)

30:59.711 --> 31:02.447
Look, I... I just wanted to apologize

31:02.472 --> 31:04.506
for the way I acted
at the bowling alley.

31:04.768 --> 31:07.569
I'm ashamed that I made a scene.

31:07.594 --> 31:09.320
I shouldn't have let
things get so heated.

31:09.545 --> 31:12.347
Definitely not Alicia Keys cool.

31:14.182 --> 31:16.179
Still no love? All right.

31:17.026 --> 31:20.328
Anyway, um, I just wanted to say that...

31:24.001 --> 31:26.351
I've had two nervous
breakdowns in my life.

31:27.461 --> 31:29.296
One right before Tess was born,

31:29.686 --> 31:31.507
and one just earlier this year.

31:33.469 --> 31:36.704
And they happen when
I let myself get stressed out,

31:36.973 --> 31:39.406
and it just builds up
inside, and then...

31:39.688 --> 31:40.859
(imitates explosion)

31:42.820 --> 31:44.992
But, uh, one of the things that helps me

31:45.017 --> 31:46.818
when I'm feeling stressed,
though, is running.

31:47.379 --> 31:48.773
I run, like, every day.

31:48.927 --> 31:51.757
Just helps me clear my mind.

31:53.255 --> 31:54.312
So...

31:55.811 --> 31:57.382
if you ever feel like you want to,

31:57.407 --> 31:59.953
I would love to go running with you.

32:04.393 --> 32:06.367
She told you what I said?

32:09.344 --> 32:10.468
Oh.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.421
- Hey, Kev, do you...
- (Kevin sighs)

32:15.258 --> 32:16.559
Dude, come on.

32:16.585 --> 32:18.129
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean,

32:18.153 --> 32:19.298
what am I doing?
I'm getting better.

32:19.322 --> 32:20.534
- No pain, no gain, right?
- No.

32:20.558 --> 32:23.281
Actually, no pain, full recovery.

32:23.306 --> 32:24.218
Take your hand off that.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.789
No, no, no. Dude, come on. (chuckles)

32:25.814 --> 32:28.750
I hereby release you
from all of your nursing duties.

32:28.775 --> 32:29.954
Okay? You can go back to your room

32:29.978 --> 32:31.289
and binge-watch
<i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>

32:31.313 --> 32:32.825
- or whatever it was you were doing.
<i>- Handmaid's Tale?</i>

32:32.849 --> 32:34.398
- What? Okay. Here.
- (sighs)

32:34.433 --> 32:36.804
Come on, don't do that. Don't do that.

32:37.118 --> 32:38.532
You know what,
I might not be your nurse,

32:38.556 --> 32:39.836
but I am your future brother-in-law,

32:39.860 --> 32:41.305
and I'm not gonna let you
screw up your knee

32:41.329 --> 32:42.218
for the rest of your life.

32:42.243 --> 32:43.989
Well, that's really sweet
of you. I appreciate it.

32:44.013 --> 32:45.546
But I'm not gonna let this stupid knee

32:45.571 --> 32:47.789
screw up the rest of my life. Not again.

32:48.445 --> 32:49.757
Again? What-what?

32:51.215 --> 32:52.215
Kev?

32:52.851 --> 32:54.445
Hey. Hey, just...

32:54.470 --> 32:56.812
- (sighs)
- Would you just slow down?

33:05.718 --> 33:06.914
What's going on?

33:09.025 --> 33:11.593
Toby, I was three years old
when I threw my first football.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.226
I made the varsity team
when I was a sophomore.

33:14.251 --> 33:16.804
I wasn't good at football, Toby.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.029
I was great.

33:18.310 --> 33:19.703
My dad used to come to the games.

33:19.728 --> 33:21.304
He started taping them for a reel.

33:21.329 --> 33:22.664
Colleges were coming.

33:23.264 --> 33:24.531
They were scouting me.

33:27.082 --> 33:30.117
I-I had this whole future
planned, you know. I...

33:35.205 --> 33:37.117
- And then the knee goes, and then bam,
- (snaps)

33:37.141 --> 33:39.031
just like that, it's over in one second.

33:39.217 --> 33:40.234
Gone.

33:41.718 --> 33:42.757
(exhales)

33:43.766 --> 33:44.781
Wow.

33:45.933 --> 33:48.273
I mean, I knew you played
high school football, but...

33:49.321 --> 33:50.382
Geez.

33:51.150 --> 33:53.094
So, what do you do, you know?
I started acting, right?

33:53.118 --> 33:56.153
At first, I started doing it
to, uh, sort of pass the time

33:56.178 --> 33:58.312
rather than just sit there
and feel sorry for myself.

34:00.118 --> 34:01.986
But then, after a while,
I-I started to...

34:02.057 --> 34:03.618
I started to get the same thrill from it

34:03.642 --> 34:04.775
that I did from football.

34:06.150 --> 34:08.328
And here we are, man.
It's 20 years later.

34:08.831 --> 34:10.545
Right? I've been working my ass off,

34:10.571 --> 34:12.672
and I am finally on the brink
of something special

34:12.697 --> 34:14.264
and real and fulfilling,

34:14.289 --> 34:16.882
and I will be damned
if I let this stupid knee

34:16.907 --> 34:18.507
destroy another one of my dreams.

34:18.532 --> 34:22.168
And that is why you have
to let it heal fully, all right?

34:22.193 --> 34:23.560
The... It's not that big a deal.

34:23.585 --> 34:25.625
The production said they would shift

34:25.650 --> 34:27.719
- the schedule around for you.
- They <i>did</i> shift the schedule.

34:27.743 --> 34:28.976
All right, apparently
they can, they can shoot

34:29.001 --> 34:30.674
part of the Normandy scene
without me... and Ron,

34:30.697 --> 34:31.969
Ron doesn't think it's a big deal

34:31.993 --> 34:34.342
if the other guy says,
"I got you, Jimmy."

34:36.328 --> 34:37.703
Well, it's a big deal to me.

34:39.985 --> 34:42.092
And I-I appreciate all of your effort,

34:42.118 --> 34:44.119
all of your concern,
but I'm not blowing this one.

34:44.143 --> 34:45.835
Okay, man? I'm not blowing it this time.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.976
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

35:00.688 --> 35:01.804
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

35:01.829 --> 35:04.132
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

35:04.460 --> 35:05.765
When did you all get here?

35:05.790 --> 35:07.728
REBECCA: Kevin crawled in around 3:00,

35:07.762 --> 35:09.830
and the others came not that long after.

35:09.864 --> 35:11.523
- Oh.
- But you...

35:11.548 --> 35:13.967
you've been passed out
with a fever for hours.

35:14.002 --> 35:15.312
I was getting worried about you.

35:15.439 --> 35:17.140
How are you feeling?

35:17.238 --> 35:19.806
Do you think you could
itch my whole body?

35:19.841 --> 35:21.507
'Cause I don't know
that I have the strength.

35:21.531 --> 35:23.984
- I told you chicken pox is the worst.
- Oh, yeah.

35:24.009 --> 35:25.195
Sure is, kiddo.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.023
Hey, babe, could you get me the Tylenol?

35:28.342 --> 35:30.781
I-I think I left it in the kitchen.
(sniffs)

35:31.036 --> 35:33.031
Hmm. The kitchen, huh?

35:33.056 --> 35:34.562
That's downstairs.

35:35.687 --> 35:37.804
Uh, I have been avoiding
going downstairs

35:37.829 --> 35:39.664
because my mother is down there.

35:39.984 --> 35:41.453
- Oh, babe.
- But you are my husband,

35:41.478 --> 35:44.906
and I love you, and you're sick,
so I will risk going downstairs

35:44.931 --> 35:46.298
and interacting with her.

35:46.323 --> 35:47.991
- Thank you, babe.
- All right, guys.

35:48.016 --> 35:50.437
I'm gonna go downstairs.
Uh, who wants something?

35:50.462 --> 35:51.702
This is your one and only shot.

35:51.737 --> 35:52.750
Hot cocoa.

35:52.896 --> 35:54.029
Cap'n Crunch.

35:54.054 --> 35:56.250
My Game Boy and some Cheetos.

35:56.275 --> 35:57.882
Wait, hold on a second.

35:57.907 --> 36:00.842
Has everyone been avoiding
going downstairs?

36:01.296 --> 36:03.851
- Okay. I got this, Bec.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:03.876 --> 36:05.265
Lie down. I'm already going down.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.423
- Jack, you're sick.
- No.

36:06.448 --> 36:08.734
We will not be held prisoner
in our own home.

36:09.783 --> 36:11.585
I'm gonna get your mother out of here.

- (laughs)

38:18.962 --> 38:20.007
It's good to be back.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.508
I told you I wouldn't
slow this puppy down.

38:21.532 --> 38:23.778
You're absolutely a man of your
word, Kevin. Thanks so much.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.563
- I will see you in there, all right?
- Totally. Really appreciate it.

38:31.888 --> 38:34.062
Jack just finished digging out your car.

38:34.398 --> 38:35.398
So...

38:36.689 --> 38:37.765
I...

38:38.527 --> 38:41.095
You know, I didn't sleep
at all last night.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.955
I was truly haunted
by what you said to me.

38:44.195 --> 38:45.500
You have to understand,

38:45.525 --> 38:47.393
I grew up in a very different time.

38:47.418 --> 38:49.984
- In my day, people didn't...
- Mom, I... Stop.

38:50.046 --> 38:51.078
(sighs)

38:52.198 --> 38:54.734
It's not because he's black.

38:55.821 --> 38:59.468
Or I don't know if it's adoption

39:00.149 --> 39:02.117
or it-it's just all of it.

39:02.142 --> 39:06.343
It just all feels really
foreign to me, I guess.

39:08.541 --> 39:11.023
But I swear, Rebecca, I swear I try.

39:13.466 --> 39:14.898
You shouldn't have to try.

39:17.131 --> 39:18.312
(sighs) I know.

39:20.431 --> 39:21.468
But I do.

39:26.591 --> 39:27.906
REBECCA: Hey, sweetheart.

39:28.848 --> 39:30.460
Grandma wanted to say good-bye to you.

39:31.492 --> 39:33.273
It's nice to see you again, Randall.

39:34.268 --> 39:35.304
Okay.

39:42.101 --> 39:43.117
Wow.

39:44.054 --> 39:46.132
This looks impressive.

39:50.089 --> 39:51.992
I finally got it to work this morning

39:52.391 --> 39:53.758
when I switched this little marble

39:53.783 --> 39:55.551
for the heavier Super Ball.

39:57.639 --> 39:59.046
It's Newton's second law.

40:01.226 --> 40:03.296
You're a special young man, aren't you?

40:05.934 --> 40:07.218
Took you long enough.

40:10.410 --> 40:11.679
♪

40:22.479 --> 40:23.479
(sniffles)

40:26.414 --> 40:27.902
And me and Queen Latifah

40:27.927 --> 40:30.272
were looking everywhere for the puppies,

40:30.297 --> 40:32.289
but I woke up before we found them.

40:32.314 --> 40:33.921
RANDALL: Oh, that's too bad.

40:47.289 --> 40:49.055
I have to commend
your commitment to your health.

40:49.079 --> 40:50.976
I can tell how seriously
you're taking all this.

40:51.314 --> 40:52.328
Thank you.

40:53.793 --> 40:54.968
Oh, um...

40:55.818 --> 40:57.757
I bought the vitamins
that you recommended.

40:57.782 --> 40:58.890
Are these the right ones?

41:01.024 --> 41:04.773
You know, it's just because...
(sighs) my age and my weight,

41:04.820 --> 41:06.453
I want to follow the instructions.

41:06.478 --> 41:09.054
You're doing everything you can
right now to stay healthy.

41:10.523 --> 41:11.578
Thanks.

41:17.121 --> 41:19.117
So, is it still there?

41:20.613 --> 41:21.679
It's still there.

41:22.361 --> 41:25.148
Your poppy seed is now
the size of a lentil.

41:25.850 --> 41:26.867
Congratulations.

41:26.892 --> 41:28.484
You're officially six weeks along.
