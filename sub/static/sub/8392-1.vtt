AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

06:57.580 --> 07:00.094

07:02.240 --> 07:04.720
AND LET OTHERS

07:04.870 --> 07:07.338
MAY YOU BUILD
A LADDER TO THE STARS

07:07.490 --> 07:09.173
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

07:09.320 --> 07:14.735
AND MAY YOU
STAY FOREVER YOUNG

07:14.880 --> 07:16.973
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

07:17.120 --> 07:19.600
MAY YOU GREW UP
TO BE TRUE

07:19.740 --> 07:21.844
MAY YOU ALWAYS
KNOW THE TRUTH

07:21.990 --> 07:23.878
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

07:24.020 --> 07:26.602
MAY YOU ALWAYS
BE COURAGEOUS

07:26.750 --> 07:28.786
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

07:28.930 --> 07:35.096
AND MAY YOU
STAY FOREVER YOUNG

07:35.240 --> 07:36.684
- I DON'T REMEMBER THE LINES
BUT IT WAS LONG.

07:36.830 --> 07:39.697
- WHAT? STOP COMPLAINING,
OLD MAN.

07:39.830 --> 07:40.819
- DID YOU JUST
CALL ME OLD?

07:40.970 --> 07:42.176
- I'M JUST FEELING NERVOUS

07:42.320 --> 07:43.480
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
I'M TORTURING YOU.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.040
IS THIS BAD?
- NO, IT'S NOT TORTURE.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.148
- I'M FEELING TORTURED BECAUSE
THIS LINE IS TAKING FOREVER.

07:47.290 --> 07:48.803
SPEED IT UP.
- STOP.

07:48.950 --> 07:49.359
- YEAH, SPEED IT UP.
- ALEX, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

07:49.500 --> 07:50.592
- HADDIE?

07:50.740 --> 07:51.536
- I THOUGHT WE
WERE MAKING JOKES.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.183
- OH MY GOD!

07:53.330 --> 07:55.298
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GREAT, WE'LL NEVER LEAVE NOW.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.702
- I MEAN, GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU.

07:56.850 --> 07:58.078
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE SENIORS.

07:58.230 --> 08:00.152
FROM SEVENTH GRADE TO THIS?
NO, THERE'S NO WAY.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.949
HEY, MAX. HEY, ALEX.
- HEY. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.237

08:03.370 --> 08:04.780
UM, SO, DID YOU GET
THE EMAILS ABOUT THE PARTY

08:04.930 --> 08:06.067
AT ZACH'S THIS SATURDAY?

08:06.200 --> 08:07.679
- YES.

08:07.830 --> 08:08.615
- THE FIRST PARTY OF
SENIOR YEAR IS GONNA BE AMAZING.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.614
- AMAZING,
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD, RIGHT?

08:10.760 --> 08:11.920
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU GOT THE EMAIL?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.137
- HE DOESN'T
REALLY LIKE PARTIES.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.508
- I LIKED THEM WHEN
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.797
- RIGHT, OKAY.

08:16.940 --> 08:17.520
- IS THERE GONNA
BE ALCOHOL AT THE PARTY?

08:17.660 --> 08:18.797
- UH...

08:18.940 --> 08:20.168
- MAX!
- MOST DEFINITELY NOT, NO.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.628
- IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

08:21.770 --> 08:22.737
- BECAUSE IF THERE IS,
THEN ALEX SHOULDN'T GO

08:22.880 --> 08:26.634
'CAUSE HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.
- GREAT.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.839
- WAIT, JUST--MAX IS JUST
LOOKING OUT FOR ME, OKAY?

08:28.990 --> 08:30.082

08:47.760 --> 08:51.526
[Harry Nilsson's COCONUT]

08:51.660 --> 08:55.312

HE BOUGHT IT FOR A DIME

08:55.460 --> 08:58.179
HIS SISTER HAD ANOTHER ONE
SHE PAID IT FOR THE LIME

08:58.330 --> 09:00.491

09:13.270 --> 09:14.885

10:06.500 --> 10:10.322
[sighs]

10:10.470 --> 10:12.426
PAUL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I GOT TO JUGGLE

10:12.570 --> 10:13.980
A FEW THINGS AROUND
BUT I CAN BE THERE.

10:14.130 --> 10:15.199
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW AT 4:00.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.127
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU TOO.

10:17.270 --> 10:19.022
I LOVE BEVERAGES, AND YOU KNOW,
THEY NEED TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

10:19.170 --> 10:22.094
I'M--I'M--
NO, I'M JUST JOKING AROUND.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.095
OKAY, THANK YOU.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.720
[sighs]

10:27.860 --> 10:28.827
ALL RIGHT.

10:28.970 --> 10:32.064
[phone ringing]

10:32.210 --> 10:35.976
- HI ZOE! HOW ARE YOU?
- AMAZING, WONDERFUL.

10:36.110 --> 10:39.932
- UM, GOSH, I SHOULD GO DECAF.
OH, I NEED SOME CAFFEINE THOUGH.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.423
I'M FEELING SO LAGGY,
THAT AFTERNOON THING, YOU KNOW.

10:42.570 --> 10:43.901
I'M EXHAUSTED.

10:44.050 --> 10:46.769
UM, LET'S DO CAF DOUBLE--
NO, NO, YOU KNOW,

10:46.920 --> 10:48.535
OKAY HALF CAF, SOLD.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.879
- OKAY! GOOD, GREAT, THANKS
FOR BRINGING ME INTO THAT.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.816
- OH MY GOD,
ARE YOU PREGNANT?

10:55.960 --> 10:58.611
- NO, I JUST HAD
A REALLY BIG BURRITO FOR LUNCH,

10:58.760 --> 11:01.888
SO I'M PREGNANT, YEAH.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.541
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S AMAZING.

11:03.690 --> 11:04.759
- YUP.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.379
- I JUST HAVE BABIES
ON THE BRAIN

11:06.520 --> 11:07.828
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE
BEEN TRYING FOR A SECOND,

11:07.970 --> 11:09.278
YOU KNOW, SO, I PROBABLY
WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE--

11:09.420 --> 11:11.217
- $1.50.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.806
YEAH, GREAT, THANKS.
- UM, KEEP THE CHANGE.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.944
- OH! I CAN
GO TO COLLEGE, THANKS.

11:18.090 --> 11:19.591
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?

11:19.740 --> 11:25.155
- OH, IT'S, UM, A HUMAN BABY,
SO, I'M PRETTY EXCITED.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.780
- MM-HMM.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.229
- AMBER, ARE YOU
IN HERE? HEY!

11:30.370 --> 11:31.758
UM, YOU LEFT THIS
OUT ON THE TABLE.

11:31.890 --> 11:32.959
THEY'RE HOLDING YOUR DIPLOMA

11:33.100 --> 11:34.579
BECAUSE OF
OVERDUE LIBRARY BOOKS?

11:34.720 --> 11:35.584
WHAT IS THAT?

11:35.720 --> 11:36.926
- YES, I KNOW.

11:37.070 --> 11:37.820
- AMBER, YOU SHOULD
GET YOUR DIPLOMA.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.198
WE SHOULD
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.317
- I MEAN, IT'S
NOT REALLY THAT IMPORTANT.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.548
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT?

11:43.700 --> 11:45.486
IT'S YOUR DIPLOMA
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

11:45.630 --> 11:46.904
- AT LEAST I GRADUATED.
- [sighs] OH, GOD.

11:47.050 --> 11:48.381
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:48.530 --> 11:50.179
- THIS WILL
FIT THAT APARTMENT PERFECT LY.

11:50.330 --> 11:51.774
- WHAT APARTMENT?
- THE APARTMENT THAT WE SAW.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.252
- THE SINKLESS APARTMENT?

11:53.400 --> 11:54.799
- THAT'S THE ONE!
- YOU'RE NOT LIVING THERE.

11:54.950 --> 11:55.803
- WELL--
- LET'S KEEP LOOKING.

11:55.950 --> 11:57.679
- I BEG TO DIFFER.
I TOOK IT.

11:57.820 --> 11:58.707
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
- I TOOK IT--YES, I DID.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.397
- WHY?

12:00.540 --> 12:02.098
- BECAUSE THREE OTHER PEOPLE
WANTED IT,

12:02.230 --> 12:03.401
AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO LOSE IT.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.689
SO, I DROVE BACK
AND PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT.

12:05.820 --> 12:08.755
- OKAY, WHEN IS
THIS MOVE HAPPENING?

12:08.900 --> 12:12.028
- I MOVE IN
AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.899
- AMBER, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.962
IF YOU LIKE
THE APARTMENT, FINE,

12:16.110 --> 12:18.146
BUT YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO

12:18.280 --> 12:19.793
THAT YOU WERE NOT
IN A VERY GOOD PLACE

12:19.940 --> 12:20.975
AND IT JUST FEELS LIKE THINGS
ARE MOVING VERY QUICKLY

12:21.110 --> 12:22.737
AND HAPHAZARD AND--AND SCARY.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.279
- OKAY, OKAY--I GET IT.
OKAY?

12:24.430 --> 12:26.773
BUT I JUST
GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.081
- WHY?
- OKAY?

12:28.230 --> 12:29.424
- WHAT'S SO BAD
ABOUT LIVING HERE?

12:29.570 --> 12:31.913
- BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
I DISAPPOINTED EVERYBODY,

12:32.060 --> 12:34.392
AND I FEEL SUFFOCATED,
AND I WANT MY OWN SPACE.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.360
- OKAY.
- I NEED SPACE NOW, OKAY?

12:36.510 --> 12:38.432
THAT'S THE WAY
THAT IT IS, OKAY?

12:38.580 --> 12:43.927
- OKAY.
- GREAT.

12:44.070 --> 12:46.163
- SO THERE'S ABOUT
FIVE TO TEN DAYS OF TRAVEL

12:46.310 --> 12:48.198
TO DEAL WITH THE
REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS,

12:48.350 --> 12:51.729
SPOKANE, TACOMA, IDAHO FALLS,
IS THAT AN ISSUE?

12:51.870 --> 12:53.007
- NOPE, NOPE,
I CAN TRAVEL.

12:53.150 --> 12:54.629
- UH-HUH.
YOU SAW THE SALARY?

12:54.770 --> 12:56.385
- I DID.

12:56.530 --> 12:58.805
AND IT'S CERTAINLY LESS
THAN WHAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO,

12:58.950 --> 13:00.178
BUT I CAN MAKE THAT WORK.

13:00.330 --> 13:03.254
- I SEE YOU WERE
A SENIOR EXECUTIVE AT TNS.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.628
- YEAH, C.0.0.

13:04.780 --> 13:06.395
- C.0.0.

13:06.540 --> 13:10.260
BUT YOU REALIZE THE POSITION
HERE AT R & B IS MUCH DIFFERENT.

13:10.410 --> 13:11.809
- I DO, I DO, I UNDERSTAND.

13:11.960 --> 13:15.191
AND I'M READY
TO START OUT THERE, AND...

13:15.340 --> 13:16.090
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.264
I'M A VERY CREATIVE GUY,

13:17.410 --> 13:18.684
I HAD A LOT OF--

13:18.830 --> 13:20.798
- YEAH, UM, LOOK, ADAM.
- YEAH.

13:20.930 --> 13:25.242
- THIS IS NOT
A CREATIVE POSITION.

13:25.390 --> 13:27.039
- IT'S GETTING THE BEVERAGES
INTO THE STORES

13:27.180 --> 13:29.068
AND GETTING
PAID FOR THEM.

13:29.220 --> 13:32.428
THAT'S THE JOB.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.494
- RIGHT, YEAH.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.392
[laughs]
NO, I GET IT.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.986
I DO.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.816
AND I'M READY
TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.120
THIS IS WHERE I'M AT
IN MY LIFE,

13:44.270 --> 13:45.601
AND I'M READY FOR IT.

13:45.750 --> 13:46.819
SO YOU JUST HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT I HAVE TO DO

13:46.960 --> 13:51.579
TO GET THE JOB,
AND I'M READY TO GO.

13:56.550 --> 13:57.448
- I HAVE CHECKED THE LIBRARY,
I'M SORRY.

13:57.590 --> 13:58.864
- YEAH?

13:59.010 --> 14:00.272
- I'M JUST GETTING VERY
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE ALL I WANT

14:00.420 --> 14:02.172
IS MY DAUGHTER'S DIPLOMA,
HER HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.241
- I KNOW.

14:03.390 --> 14:04.106
- THAT SHE
WORKED SO HARD FOR.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.456
- I'M SURE SHE DID.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.555
- AND COMPLETED
ALL OF HER CLASSES.

14:06.700 --> 14:07.689
IT WAS JUST
THESE PESKY LIBRARY BOOKS

14:07.840 --> 14:09.284
THAT WERE
STANDING IN THE WAY NOW.

14:09.430 --> 14:10.397
- YEAH, BUT I CAN'T
RELEASE THE DIPLOMA

14:10.530 --> 14:11.872
UNTIL THE BOOKS
ARE RETURNED.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.419
- WHICH I UNDERSTAND,
WHICH I THINK--

14:13.570 --> 14:14.946
- THEY BELONG TO THE SCHOOL.
- WHICH I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT.

14:15.090 --> 14:15.602
- NO, I KNOW, AND SHE HAS
RETURNED THE BOOKS NOW

14:15.750 --> 14:16.819
WHICH I--MRS. POLLINO.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.121
- THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

14:18.270 --> 14:19.885
- WHAT? NO, NO, NO,
IT WASN'T LIKE A LIE.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.406
IT WAS ACTUAL BOOKS THAT--

14:21.550 --> 14:22.574
- THERE'S A LOCK
ON THE ACCOUNT.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.164
- SHE DIDN'T EVEN
CARE ABOUT THE DIPLOMA.

14:24.310 --> 14:25.641
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S
A LOCK ON THE ACCOUNT.

14:25.790 --> 14:27.337
BUT MRS. POLLINO SAID IF YOU
JUST PICKED UP THE PHONE

14:27.480 --> 14:29.038
AND CALLED HER THAT THEN
SHE CAN CHECK, MAKE SURE--

14:29.170 --> 14:30.273
- OH, YOU KNOW,
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO I TALK TO.

14:30.420 --> 14:31.444
IF IT DOESN'T SHOW UP
IN THE COMPUTER--

14:31.590 --> 14:32.511
- THAT IS SO INSANE,
BECAUSE THE PERSON--

14:32.660 --> 14:34.002
- I CAN'T GIVE OUT
THE DIPLOMA.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.107
- PUT THAT INFORMATION
IN THE COMPUTER

14:35.250 --> 14:35.625
SO CHANGE THE INFORMATION
IN THE COMPUTER.

14:35.770 --> 14:37.419
- I KNOW.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.379
- SO I'M JUST ASKING YOU IF YOU
COULD PICK UP THE PHONE

14:38.530 --> 14:39.792
AND CALL MRS. POLLINO
AND THEN IT

14:39.940 --> 14:41.111
WILL BE IN THE COMPUTER AND
THEN YOU CAN RELEASE IT!

14:41.250 --> 14:42.285
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
WHAT'S--WHAT'S HAPPENING?

14:42.430 --> 14:43.658
- OH, I'M TAKING MY LUNCH.
- RIGHT NOW?

14:43.810 --> 14:45.209
- RIGHT NOW.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.110
- NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER'S DIPLOMA!

14:46.260 --> 14:47.659
- SARAH.
- HI.

14:47.810 --> 14:50.608
- HI.
[clears throat]

14:50.750 --> 14:52.263
- HI.
- HI.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.049
- [laughs] HI, SHARON.
- HEY, MARK.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.885
- WE TAKE OUR LUNCH BREAKS
VERY SERIOUSLY OVER HERE,

14:57.030 --> 14:58.258
BUT I'M ON MINE.

14:58.410 --> 14:59.308
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE A COFFEE WITH ME?

14:59.450 --> 15:02.999
ARE YOU FREE?
- COFFEE? UM, YES.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.028
- YEAH?
- SURE.

15:05.180 --> 15:07.819
- ALL RIGHT, OR ACTUALLY
MAYBE FOR YOU CHAMOMILE,

15:07.970 --> 15:08.823
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.346
- FOR ME?
- YEAH.

15:10.490 --> 15:12.526
- DO I SEEM TENSE?
- NO, YOU JUST DON'T SEEM TIRED.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.831
- WELL ANYWAY, IT'S A HUGE
PAY-CUT, IT'S A HUGE STEP-DOWN,

15:14.980 --> 15:16.379
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S SOMETHING.

15:16.530 --> 15:17.633
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO
I WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDERED IT.

15:17.770 --> 15:19.522
SHOWS YOU HOW FAST
THINGS CAN CHANGE.

15:19.670 --> 15:23.322
- YOU SOUND REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY.

15:23.470 --> 15:25.085
- YOU GUYS GOOD?
- YEAH.

15:25.230 --> 15:29.576
- SO THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME
THE OTHER NIGHT.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.951
- YEAH, I WAS, UH--
IT WAS VERY AWESOME.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.886
- SO WHEN DO I
GET TO SEE YOU AGAIN?

15:35.030 --> 15:36.338
- SOON.
- REALLY?

15:36.480 --> 15:37.686
- BECAUSE YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA CALL

15:37.830 --> 15:39.798
THE OTHER NIGHT, REMEMBER?

15:39.930 --> 15:42.137
- YES, AND THEN
I WAS WORKING

15:42.280 --> 15:43.486
BUT I'M GONNA
CALL YOU TONIGHT

15:43.630 --> 15:45.211
AND WE'RE
GONNA MAKE A PLAN.

15:45.350 --> 15:46.282
- OKAY, GREAT,
I LIKE THAT.

15:46.420 --> 15:47.170
[giggIeSI

15:47.320 --> 15:50.118
OKAY, COOL.
- OKAY.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.707
- REALLY?
- SHE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.909
I'M RUNNING OUT OF THINGS
TO SAY SO I'M SORRY

15:54.050 --> 15:55.324
I BROUGHT YOU INTO IT.

15:55.470 --> 15:56.698
- YOU KNOW, I SEE
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

15:56.850 --> 15:57.987
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CALL HER,
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA

15:58.120 --> 15:58.779
RUIN THE PANCAKE HOUSE
FOR ME.

15:58.920 --> 15:59.989
- I GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL.

16:00.130 --> 16:01.574
- LIKE I DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.677
- LISTEN, ACTUALLY I HAVE
SOMETHING SERIOUS TO TALK ABOUT.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.162
- WHAT, SAN DY?

16:04.300 --> 16:05.574
- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE LUNCHEONETTE?

16:05.720 --> 16:06.573
- NO, IS THAT THE PLACE
WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO GO

16:06.720 --> 16:08.062
BECAUSE OF SANDY?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.679
- NO, THAT'S NOT THE PLACE
WE'RE GONNA GO.

16:09.830 --> 16:11.229
IT'S THE MOST FAMOUS RECORDING
STUDIO IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.779
AND IT CAME UP FOR LEASE.
- AND?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.488
- WE SHOULD GO IN TO BUSINESS
TOGETHER, YOU AND ME.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.485
THINK ABOUT THAT.
- [laughs]

16:16.630 --> 16:17.654
- IT'S IN THE COSMOS, ALL
OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE THIS JOB.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.006
- OH NO.
- IT'S SO STABLE AND THEN--

16:19.150 --> 16:20.526
- NO, NO, NO.
- AND THEN THIS COMES UP?

16:20.660 --> 16:22.173
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.696
YOU WOULD BE THE PERFECT
RIGHT BRAIN TO MY LEFT BRAIN.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.353
- CROSBY, DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT A BUSINESS PLAN IS?

16:25.500 --> 16:26.831
- I HAVEN'T FIGURED
ALL THAT OUT YET.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.140
- WHAT KIND OF INITIAL INCOME
DO YOU ANTICIPATE?

16:28.290 --> 16:29.188
- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY,
BUT A LOT.

16:29.330 --> 16:30.319
- YOU GOTTA HAVE
A BUSINESS PLAN.

16:30.470 --> 16:31.607
YOU GONNA BE ORGANIZED.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.560
YOU CAN'T JUST
STUMBLE INTO THIS.

16:33.710 --> 16:35.883
- LISTEN, I HAVE
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANDS.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.294
- MM-HM.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.668
- THEY LOVE ME AND
THEY HATE MY BOSS.

16:38.820 --> 16:40.742
IF I STARTED MY OWN STUDIO,
THEY WOULD ALL FOLLOW ME

16:40.890 --> 16:42.096
OVER IN A SECOND.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.571
AND THAT'S BUILT-IN CLIENTELE.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.472
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT BUSINESS PLAN?

16:45.620 --> 16:47.542
- DO YOU HAVE THAT IN WRITING?
- I HAVE IT IN FIST BUMPS.

16:47.690 --> 16:48.918
- LISTEN TO ME CROSBY,
TAKE IT FROM ME.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.628
KEEP YOUR JOB, OKAY?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.102
KEEP YOUR JOB.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.457
- HEY, TALK TO YOU TONIGHT.

16:54.590 --> 16:56.217
- YUP, ABSOLUTELY.
- THANK YOU, SANDY.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.828
- THERE YOU GO.

16:58.980 --> 17:01.357
- [sighs]

17:01.500 --> 17:05.322
- ZOE, HI.
UM, HOW'S YOUR THURSDAY?

17:05.470 --> 17:07.870
- PHENOMENAL.
- GREAT, I WILL HAVE THE USUAL.

17:08.020 --> 17:11.365
- YOU WANUIMT IN THAT?

17:11.510 --> 17:13.785
[sighs] YOU KNOW WHAT,
CAN I JUST TALK TO YOU

17:13.920 --> 17:15.160
FOR A SECOND?

17:15.310 --> 17:19.303
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
- UM...

17:19.450 --> 17:20.758
I WOULD LIKE TO
APOLOGIZE FOR YESTERDAY.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.470
THAT WAS PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME

17:22.620 --> 17:25.339
AND, UM, I OVERSTEPPED
MY BOUNDARIES.

17:25.490 --> 17:27.208
PERHAPS I JUST GOT EXCITED,
YOU KNOW, SO--BUT...

17:27.350 --> 17:29.272
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S--YOU'RE--THAT'S FINE.

17:29.420 --> 17:30.387
IT'S COOL.
- OKAY.

17:30.530 --> 17:33.454
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.591
YOU KNOW, I'D--
THE TRUTH IS

17:35.740 --> 17:38.049
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT

17:38.190 --> 17:41.398
BECAUSE I'M NOT KEEPING IT,

17:41.540 --> 17:46.125
SO IT'S JUST KIND OF EASIER
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

17:46.270 --> 17:49.717
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- YEAH.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.952
- UM...

17:51.100 --> 17:54.137
ANYWAY, I'M GETTING
YOUR COFFEE.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.621
[coffee pouring]

18:00.760 --> 18:02.034
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.796
THE DIPLOMA JUST
BECAME IMPORTANT TO ME

18:04.940 --> 18:06.737
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T
SEEM IMPORTANT TO HER.

18:06.870 --> 18:08.929
AND I'VE WANTED
SOMETHING BETTER FOR HER.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.661
- LIKE COLLEGE.

18:10.810 --> 18:12.323
- WELL, I DON'T
WANNA PRESSURE HER,

18:12.470 --> 18:15.701
I JUST THOUGHT SHE'D BE
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.

18:15.850 --> 18:17.363
- WELL, I SEE A LOT OF KIDS
COME THROUGH HERE

18:17.510 --> 18:18.534
AND THEY GRADUATE
AND THEY GO

18:18.680 --> 18:19.954
RIGHT TO COLLEGE,

18:20.090 --> 18:23.878
AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN
CLOSE TO BEING READY FOR IT.

18:24.030 --> 18:25.167
- YEAH.

18:25.310 --> 18:27.540
- AND AMBER
WILL GO TO COLLEGE.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.134
- YOU THINK?
- YEAH.

18:29.280 --> 18:33.239
AND WHEN SHE GOES,
SHE'LL BE READY TO GO

18:33.380 --> 18:35.723
AND SHE'S GONNA
DO GREAT THINGS.

18:35.870 --> 18:38.145
AND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO
THINK OF IT LIKE THIS NOW,

18:38.280 --> 18:41.807
BUT I THINK THAT THIS,
WAITING FOR HER

18:41.940 --> 18:45.762
IS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE.

18:45.910 --> 18:49.118
- DO YOU?
- YES.

18:49.260 --> 18:53.708
SOMETIMES YOU JUST
HAVE TO BELIEVE....

18:53.850 --> 18:55.124
YOU KNOW?

18:55.270 --> 18:57.647
- YEAH, YEAH.

19:01.620 --> 19:05.340
- WOW.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.038
- UH...
- I'M SORRY.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.750
- NO...NO, NO, NO.

19:08.900 --> 19:09.719
I WAS--
- NO.

19:09.870 --> 19:11.076
- I JUST WASN'T
EXPECTING IT.

19:11.210 --> 19:12.347
THAT'S WHY I SAID...
- WHY WOULD YOU?

19:12.490 --> 19:13.309
[laughs] IT WAS SO WEIRD.
- IT WASN'T WEIRD.

19:13.460 --> 19:14.142
NO, IT WASN'T
WEIRD AT ALL, I--

19:14.290 --> 19:15.769
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M SORRY.

19:15.910 --> 19:16.831
- I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID--
- IT JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.004
AND IT'S--
I'M TURNING 40 THIS WEEK.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.947
- OH! HAPPY--
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.015
BUT I THINK MAYBE I'M HAVING
SOME MORE ISSUES THAN I THOUGHT.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.604
I'M HAVING EEMF TROUBLES.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.014
- I DIDN'T THINK
I HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH IT

19:26.160 --> 19:27.707
BUT I THINK I'M--
I WAS ACTING OUT,

19:27.850 --> 19:28.771
YOU KNOW,
HOW PEOPLE DO, BUT...

19:28.920 --> 19:30.148
- NO.

19:30.300 --> 19:30.959
- LET'S PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.328
CAN WE DO THAT?

19:32.480 --> 19:33.333
CAN WE JUST LIKE
NEVER SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.742
- I WAS--
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID "WHOA."

19:34.890 --> 19:35.993
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, BUT--THANKS.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.348
BUT NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR THE COFFEE.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.654
[bell ringing]

19:48.320 --> 19:49.412
- OVER A THOUSAND TEENS
DIE EACH YEAR

19:49.560 --> 19:51.903
FROM CAR ACCIDENTS
INVOLVING DRUNK DRIVING.

19:52.050 --> 19:53.494
- OKAY, MAX.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.289
- OH, AND ALMOST 90% OF
ALCOHOLICS WILL RELAPSE

19:55.430 --> 19:57.978
AT LEAST ONCE
BEFORE REACHING SOBRIETY.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.747
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD GO TO THIS PARTY, ALEX.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.507
- I THINK YOU'RE
BEING INSENSITIVE,

20:01.640 --> 20:02.675
AND I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.264
STOP TALKING.

20:04.410 --> 20:05.672
- WELL, I KNOW THERE'S ALCOHOL
AT HIGH SCHOOL PARTIES.

20:05.820 --> 20:07.026
I WATCH
FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.

20:07.170 --> 20:08.740
- OH, I FORGOT THAT
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

20:08.890 --> 20:10.300
I LOVE YOU, MAX,
I LOVE YOU.

20:10.450 --> 20:12.964
I WISH I WAS AS HONEST
WITH MYSELF AS YOU.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.829
- HEY, YOU'RE GOING 20 MILES
UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.726
- IT MEANS IF I WAS
BEING HONEST WITH MYSELF,

20:17.870 --> 20:21.863
I WOULDN'T BE
GOING TO THIS PARTY.

20:22.010 --> 20:23.898
- OKAY, I KNEW YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.939
- I KNEW IT MEANT A LOT TO YOU,
SO THAT'S WHY I'M GOING.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.457
- IT'S--WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.840
I DON'T CARE,
IT'S JUST A STUPID PARTY.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.459
IF YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

20:32.610 --> 20:34.054
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO.

20:34.190 --> 20:36.988
- IT'S JUST--I THINK IT'LL BE
A DUMB MOVE FOR ME

20:37.130 --> 20:38.916
TO GO TO A HIGH SCHOOL PARTY

20:39.060 --> 20:40.812
WHERE I DON'T
WANT TO BE AT ANYWAY.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.099
- I DON'T WANT TO BE FLAKEY
AND I JUST TOLD EVERYBODY

20:43.240 --> 20:44.571
THAT I WAS GONNA GO.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.789
AND THE PARTY IS TOMORROW.

20:45.930 --> 20:49.058
- THEN GO.

20:49.210 --> 20:52.031
NO, SERIOUSLY, GO.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.442
SO HOW ABOUT
WE DO THIS?

20:53.590 --> 20:54.454
HOW ABOUT I'LL
PICK YOU UP AFTER THE PARTY

20:54.590 --> 20:57.969
AND WE'LL
JUST HANG OUT AFTERWARDS.

20:58.110 --> 21:01.045
- YEAH, OKAY.

21:07.190 --> 21:08.259
- TOOTHBRUSH! AFTERSHAVE!

21:08.400 --> 21:09.708
BAR OF SOAP! HIKE!

21:09.850 --> 21:11.124
[laughs]
TERRIBLE HIKE!

21:11.270 --> 21:12.885
- OH!
- OH!

21:13.030 --> 21:13.951
[claps]
YEAH!

21:14.100 --> 21:15.601
- OH, YEAH!
UH-HUH! UH-HUH! LET'S GO!

21:15.750 --> 21:16.887
UH-HUH! UH-HUH! UH-HUH!
- TOUCHDOWN, TOUCHDOWN!

21:17.030 --> 21:17.883
ALL RIGHT, QB,
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

21:18.030 --> 21:20.544
- 39, 38, 430, HUT-HUT!

21:20.690 --> 21:22.089
GO FOR IT, GO FOR IT!
- OH!

21:22.240 --> 21:23.787
- UNH!

21:23.930 --> 21:25.818
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
COME ON!

21:25.970 --> 21:26.937
WHO WERE YOU
THROWING IT TO?

21:27.070 --> 21:28.173
- YOU.
- GO GET IT.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.719
- YOU.
- YOU THREW IT.

21:29.870 --> 21:30.905
- YOU.
- I DIDN'T THROW IT OVER THERE.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.555
-AAH!

21:34.700 --> 21:35.974
- I CAN'T FIND IT.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.735
- WELL, KEEP LOOKING,
IT'S IN THERE.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.849
- I DON'T SEE IT.
- IT DIDN'T VANISH.

21:40.980 --> 21:43.847
UM...
- CROSBY, CROSBY, CROSBY.

21:43.990 --> 21:45.434
- [laughs]

21:45.580 --> 21:48.151
I AM SO SORRY COULDN'T
CALL YOU THE OTHER NIGHT.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.858
I COULDN'T--
I WAS IN A SESSION

21:49.990 --> 21:51.059
THAT WENT REALLY LATE
AND I--

21:51.200 --> 21:52.303
- CROSBY, WE SHOULD TALK.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.759
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THIS

21:53.890 --> 21:56.165
INCREDIBLE CONNECTION
BETWEEN US.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.345
DON'T YOU FEEL THAT?

21:57.480 --> 21:59.869
- YEAH, IT'S
A STRONG CONNECTION.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.513
- YEAH, BUT SOMETHING'S
HOLDING YOU BACK THOUGH,

22:01.660 --> 22:03.139
AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST
WALK AWAY FROM THIS

22:03.280 --> 22:04.656
WITHOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU

22:04.800 --> 22:06.688
FROM MOVING FORWARD,
I--WE JUST--

22:06.840 --> 22:08.592
- I FOUND IT.
- HEY.

22:08.740 --> 22:11.208
- HEY, WHO'S THIS LITTLE GUY?

22:11.360 --> 22:13.464
- THIS IS MY SON, JABBAR.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.841
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE A DAD?

22:15.980 --> 22:19.768
- YUP, I'M A DAD.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.330
- SO, THAT'S WHY YOU
DIDN'T CALL THE OTHER NIGHT?

22:21.470 --> 22:23.779
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FATHER?

22:23.920 --> 22:26.787
- YUP.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.886
IT'S--WE GET REALLY BUSY
AND, YOU KNOW.

22:29.030 --> 22:33.683
I GOTTA FOCUS ON--
- OH, MY GOD.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.445
HI, JABBAR.
- HI.

22:35.590 --> 22:38.889
- HI, I'M SANDY.
I'M YOUR DAD'S SPECIAL FRIEND.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.383
- OH.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.908
- YOU'RE UP.

22:52.060 --> 22:53.220
- YUP.

22:53.370 --> 22:54.883
- AGAIN, HUH?

22:55.020 --> 22:56.089
- YEAH.
- HONEY, WHAT YOU DOING?

22:56.230 --> 22:57.743
- CROSBY HAD THIS CRAZY IDEA
TO TAKE OVER

22:57.890 --> 22:59.050
THIS OLD
RECORDING STUDIO.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.236
SO I'M JUST
RUNNING SOME NUMBERS.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.927
- A RECORDING STUDIO?
- YUP.

23:03.070 --> 23:06.369
- ISN'T THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
KIND OF IMPLODING?

23:06.520 --> 23:07.680
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S INTERESTING.

23:07.830 --> 23:08.819
- YEAH?
- MM.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.825
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO UPSTAIRS, OKAY?

23:13.840 --> 23:15.933
- I WILL IN A MINUTE.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.731
- HONEY, THEY'RE GONNA
CALL YOU ABOUT THAT JOB.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.632
THEY'D BE SO CRAZY NOT TO.
- WELL, I HOPE SO.

23:20.770 --> 23:22.112
IT'S JUST
I'M GETTING WORRIED, YOU KNOW?

23:22.260 --> 23:26.538
I MEAN, I CAN'T
BELIEVE THE TIMING.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.911
- IT'S GREAT.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.881
WELL, I HAVE SOME,
SORT OF GOOD NEWS.

23:33.030 --> 23:34.406
- WHAT'S THAT?

23:34.550 --> 23:35.505
- THEY'VE ASKED ME TO STAY ON
AND THEY'VE OFFERED ME

23:35.650 --> 23:37.925
A FU LL-TIME POSITION.

23:38.070 --> 23:40.857
- WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
- THEY TOOK ME TO LUNCH.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.230
THEY SAID, "KRISTINA,
YOU'RE DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB."

23:43.380 --> 23:44.756
- YOU TOLD THEM YES.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.037
- I FELT LIKE I HAD TO
SAY YES IN THE MOMENT.

23:46.180 --> 23:47.693
- BUT YOU DIDN'T NEED TO
SAY YES IN THE MOMENT.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.899
YOU COULD'VE SAID "I NEED
TO DISCUSS THIS WITH MY FAMILY."

23:50.040 --> 23:52.144
- I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.
I'M DISCUSSING.

23:52.290 --> 23:53.939
WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO DISCOURAGING?

23:54.080 --> 23:55.069
WE NEED THE MONEY, ADAM.
WE DON'T HAVE--

23:55.220 --> 23:56.596
- I KNOW WE
NEED THE MONEY, KRISTINA.

23:56.740 --> 23:57.809
IT'S A LOT LESS MONEY
THAN WE NEED.

23:57.950 --> 23:59.429
I'M SURE IT'S LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW,

23:59.570 --> 24:01.117
25% OF WHAT WE NEED.

24:01.260 --> 24:02.329
- IT'S 25% MORE THAN WHAT
WE'RE MAKING RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

24:02.470 --> 24:03.983
OUR SAVINGS IS ALMOST GONE.

24:04.130 --> 24:05.813
OUR CUSHION'S NIL.
I'M NOT--I'M JUST SAYING--

24:05.960 --> 24:07.188
- WHAT? IT'S MY FAULT?
- IT'S NOT.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.432
- KRISTINA, I'M THE ONE

24:08.580 --> 24:09.433
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE
TAKING CARE OF US.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.332
- HEY, SHH.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.617
- I'M THE ONE WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO BE PROVIDING FOR THE FAMILY.

24:12.760 --> 24:13.613
- AND YOU ARE, YOU DO.
I JUST WANT TO HELP.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.136
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT

24:15.280 --> 24:16.304
FEELS LIKE FOR ME NOT TO
BE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW?

24:16.450 --> 24:18.099
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

24:18.240 --> 24:20.208
- I DO, I GET IT.
I JUST WANT TO HELP.

24:20.350 --> 24:23.342
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO.

24:23.490 --> 24:29.076
ADAM.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.699
[sighs]

24:35.050 --> 24:37.985
- FLIP IT WITH THESE?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

24:38.130 --> 24:41.019
AND YOU NEVER
FLIP ANOTHER MAN'S BURGER.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.197
THAT'S FOR STARTERS.

24:44.340 --> 24:47.138
[laughs]

24:47.270 --> 24:50.728
- EXCELLENT,
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

24:50.860 --> 24:52.304
JUST LIKE JACKSON POLLOCK.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.418
[laughs]

24:54.560 --> 24:57.768
- WOW, LOOKS
REALLY GOOD, GUYS.

24:57.910 --> 24:59.832
- [laughs]
- THESE BROWNIES ARE GREAT.

24:59.980 --> 25:02.039
- YEAH. THERE'S A JAR
OF PICKLES ON THE FRIDGE.

25:02.190 --> 25:03.498
- OH, I LOOK UP AND
SHE'S JUST STANDING THERE.

25:03.640 --> 25:04.664
- WAIT, THIS IS
AT YOUR HOUSE?

25:04.810 --> 25:05.902
SHE CAME TO YOUR HOUSE?
- YEAH.

25:06.050 --> 25:07.733
YEAH, SHE CAME BY
UNANNOUNCED.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.563
JUST POPPED IN.
- OH, CROSBY.

25:09.710 --> 25:12.508
- AND THEN SHE MET JABBAR AND
USED THE WORD "SPECIAL FRIEND."

25:12.640 --> 25:14.050
- NO.
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.952
- CROSBY, THAT'S GOING TO
RUIN THE PANCAKE HOUSE FOR US.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.226
- THANK YOU.

25:17.370 --> 25:18.849

25:27.520 --> 25:29.067
MOM AND DAD HELPED.

ERRANDS TO RUN.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.764

25:34.910 --> 25:35.865
- WELL, DAD WAS TRYING TO
HOLD THE GRILL FOR YOU.

25:36.010 --> 25:37.181
BUT EVERYBODY GOT HUNGRY.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.049
I ACTUALLY ATE ALREADY TOO,
SO WHATEVER.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.088
- WE'RE GOING TO

25:40.220 --> 25:41.539
WITH THE REST

25:41.670 --> 25:42.910
- OKAY, YEAH, COOL,

25:43.050 --> 25:44.802
- SORRY,

25:44.950 --> 25:46.815

25:46.950 --> 25:48.838

25:50.130 --> 25:51.290

25:51.440 --> 25:52.748

BUT SHE COULD'VE, LIKE,

25:52.890 --> 25:55.336
TEXTED OR,

25:55.480 --> 25:56.549

26:18.570 --> 26:20.367

I NEVER SEEN YOU.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.888
- OKAY.

26:22.020 --> 26:22.816
- YOU GUYS WERE
IN YOUR COCOON ALL SUMMER.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.461
TIME FOR US TO
SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

26:24.610 --> 26:26.089
- [screams]

26:26.230 --> 26:30.712
MY ANGEL, MY BABY.
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE.

26:30.860 --> 26:33.237
- I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
- OKAY, TO ALL OF US.

26:33.380 --> 26:34.722
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
SINCE SEVENTH GRADE.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.680
- SIXTH GRADE.

26:36.830 --> 26:39.651
- [indistinct] I KNOW!
- OKAY, SIXTH GRADE.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.109
- HEY.
WELCOME TO MI CASA.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.865
YOU GUYS TAKING SHOTS?
- YES.

26:44.010 --> 26:45.523
- YES.
- ONLY IF YOU'RE TAKING A SHOT.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.831
- OH!
- LOOK AT THE PARTY!

26:47.980 --> 26:50.494
THIS IS TO OUR SENIOR YEAR.
- SENIOR YEAR.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.676
- BEST YEAR OF OUR LIVES EVER.

26:52.810 --> 26:55.051
DOING IT ALL TOGETHER.
- OKAY.

26:55.190 --> 26:56.919
- WHOO!
- TRY TO DO THIS.

26:57.060 --> 26:59.506
- YOU GOTTA SLURP IT DOWN.

26:59.650 --> 27:00.981
- ANOTHER ONE?

27:01.130 --> 27:03.121
- WHOO!

27:03.270 --> 27:06.683
- BRAVERMAN FLAG.

27:06.830 --> 27:08.445
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GOING TO BE LEFT HERE.

27:08.590 --> 27:10.376
- I KNOW, BUT THE BUS
GOES RIGHT BY MY PLACE.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.340
- IS THAT YOUR THIRD BEER?
- COME OVER ALL THE TIME.

27:12.490 --> 27:13.764
IT'LL BE LIKE OUR PLACE.

27:13.900 --> 27:14.867
- OH, MY GOD,
IT'S LIKE SPRING BREAK FOR YOU.

27:15.010 --> 27:15.965
- HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

27:16.110 --> 27:17.725
IF THIS RECORDING STUDIO
IS SO GREAT,

27:17.870 --> 27:19.349
THEN WHY IS IT
BEEN SITTING FOR LEASE

27:19.490 --> 27:20.696
FOR FOUR MONTHS?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.569
- HOW DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

27:22.710 --> 27:24.974
- I LOOKED IT UP
ON THE COMPUTER.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.599
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
- YEAH.

27:26.740 --> 27:29.629
- WELL, I WOULD THINK
BECAUSE THE REAL ESTATE MARKET--

27:29.780 --> 27:31.839
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO JUMP IN.

27:31.990 --> 27:33.434
- WELL, PROBABLY
FOR GOOD REASON.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.093
I MEAN, WHY SPEND BIG MONEY
ON A RECORDING STUDIO

27:35.230 --> 27:36.959
WHEN YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING
FROM YOUR LIVING ROOM COUCH.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.169
- LOOK--
- WHY?

27:38.310 --> 27:39.709
- THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO MAKING MUSIC

27:39.860 --> 27:41.782
THAN PUSHING BUTTONS
ON A COMPUTER, ALL RIGHT?

27:41.930 --> 27:43.852
THE WHITE ALBUM
WASN'T MADE ON A COMPUTER.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.139
STICKY FINGERS
WASN'T MADE ON A COMPUTER.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.895
ARTISTS, THEY NEED A--
THEY NEED AN ENVIRONMENT

27:48.040 --> 27:49.109
TO BE INSPIRED BY.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.649
BELIEVE ME,
WHEN YOU THIS PLACE

27:50.800 --> 27:53.177
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.241
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

27:54.390 --> 27:55.766
- MM?

27:55.910 --> 27:56.945
- I THINK I'M
GONNA DANCE TONIGHT.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.809
- OH.
- OH, NO.

27:58.950 --> 28:00.156
- IT'S STARTING.
- THE FEVER.

28:00.290 --> 28:01.109
- IT'S STARTING.
- THE FEVER IS IN THE HOUSE.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.148
- [laughs]
- SO, YEAH.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.699
- SO, WHAT--
YOU A'ITACKED HIM?

28:04.850 --> 28:06.056
- I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.508
I STILL DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

28:07.650 --> 28:08.981
I KISSED HIM LIKE A--

28:09.130 --> 28:11.644
LIKE A STARVING PERSON
WHO SAW A SANDWICH.

28:11.790 --> 28:12.859
- GOOD.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.069
BUT I THINK HE LIKES YOU,
HONESTLY,

28:14.200 --> 28:16.236
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT
A BAD THING AT ALL.

28:16.380 --> 28:17.893
- LOOK AT THOSE TWO.
- YEAH.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.486
- HE'S GONNA
BE LOST WITHOUT HER.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.178
- IT'S REALLY NICE
THEY HAVE EACH OTHER.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.833
- I REALLY WANT SYDNEY
TO HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER.

28:23.970 --> 28:26.416
OR LI'ITLE SISTER.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.766
- SHE WILL ONE DAY.

28:27.910 --> 28:31.255
- THE LA'ITE GIRL AT WORK
IS PREGNANT,

28:31.390 --> 28:34.735
AND I REALLY WANT TO
ASK HER IF I CAN BUY HER BABY.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.734
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF INSANE.

28:36.880 --> 28:37.869
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT INSANE.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.749
I MEAN, SHE SELLS COFFEE,
YOU KNOW.

28:39.890 --> 28:41.050
SO PROBABLY
SHE'D SELL HER BABY.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.883
- THAT'S--
THAT WAS MY REASONING.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.089
THAT WAS EXACTLY MY LINE.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.992
STOP LOOKING--
I'M CONFIDING IN YOU.

28:47.130 --> 28:49.576
BE NICE.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.926
- [sighs] OH BOY.

28:51.070 --> 28:53.345
- KRISTINA?

28:53.490 --> 28:55.822
- YEAH,
I NEED TO PEE AGAIN.

28:55.970 --> 28:56.868
I THINK I'M GOING TO
SET A RECORD.

28:57.010 --> 28:58.386
I'LL TELL YOU,
IT'S JUST CRAZY.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.409
- KRISTINA ANNE
NICHOLAS-BRAVERMAN.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.597
I LOVE YOU AND
I'M GOING TO GET A JOB.

29:04.740 --> 29:08.039
- YOU'RE PLASTERED.
- AND I'M OKAY IF YOU WORK.

29:08.190 --> 29:10.533
I'M OKAY IF YOU DON'T WORK.

29:10.670 --> 29:11.989
WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.530
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.228
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE,
AND I AM SO HAPPY WE'RE NOT.

29:16.370 --> 29:17.917
AND YOU CAN
STAY MAD AT ME

29:18.060 --> 29:22.406
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
STAY MAD AT YOU.

29:22.550 --> 29:24.029
- YOU HAD A THIRD BEER,
DIDN'T YOU?

29:24.170 --> 29:28.652
- MAYBE.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.176
- MM, BEER TASTES GOOD.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.242
- UH-HUH.

29:32.390 --> 29:35.598
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
STEADY-YEE-YEE-YEE.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.800
- OH! HEY.
- HEY.

29:37.940 --> 29:38.929
- DID YOU FEEL THAT?
- OH, HEY, YEAH.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.069

- DON'T WORRY
TOO MUCH ABOUT HER.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.649
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GONNA MAKE MISTAKES.

39:06.790 --> 39:08.189
JUST LIKE YOU DID.

39:08.340 --> 39:12.925
SHE MAY EVEN MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES THAT YOU DID.

39:13.070 --> 39:16.790
BUT AMBER'S
GONNA LAND ON HER FEET.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.441
- [sighs]

39:18.590 --> 39:21.559
LIKE, I NEED TO
TAKE THIS WITH ME.

39:21.700 --> 39:24.931
- THE WHOLE THING?
- MM-HM, YEAH, AND THIS TOO.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.640
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A LONG NIGHT AHEAD OF ME

39:27.770 --> 39:30.773
JUST ENJOYING
NOT HAVING MY DAUGHTER,

39:30.920 --> 39:32.603
YOU KNOW,
ASKING ME FOR ADVICE

39:32.740 --> 39:34.537
LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES.

39:34.680 --> 39:35.942
IT WAS A REAL NICE PARTY,
MOM, THANKS.

39:36.090 --> 39:38.263
- SURE.

39:38.410 --> 39:43.302
- [sighs]

39:43.450 --> 39:46.965
HAPPY 40TH BIRTHDAY, MOM.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.067
- THANKS.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.678
- BELATED.

39:50.830 --> 39:53.139
YOU STILL LOOK GREAT.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.033
- YEAH, RIGHT.

39:58.460 --> 40:01.281
[soft pop song playing]

40:11.470 --> 40:12.676
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:12.820 --> 40:14.299
ISN'T THIS AMAZING?
- YEAH.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.954
IT USED TO BE A PHARMACY
AND A LUNCHEONE'ITE IN THE 405.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.886
SEE THIS RX RIGHT HERE?
- YUP.

40:19.030 --> 40:20.918
THEN A BUNCH OF HIPPIES STARTED
SQUA'ITING HERE IN THE 605,

40:21.070 --> 40:22.276
HANGING OUT
AND DOING DRUGS.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.682
THESE CARPETS HAVE
MORE SPILLED DRUGS ON THEM

40:23.830 --> 40:27.960
THAN A ROLLING STONES
TOUR BUS.

40:28.110 --> 40:29.270
THEN ONE NIGHT JERRY GARCIA
WANDERED IN--

40:29.420 --> 40:30.557
- MM-HM.

40:30.700 --> 40:31.906
- HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE PLACE.

40:32.050 --> 40:33.381
THE ACOUSTICS, THE VIBE--
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

40:33.530 --> 40:34.428
THE GRATEFUL DEAD
ARE RECORDING HERE.

40:34.570 --> 40:36.709
THE JANIS JOPLIN,
JIMI HENDRIX,

40:36.840 --> 40:37.704
NEIL YOUNG
HAS RECORDED HERE.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.216
- WOW!
- I'M TELLING YOU.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.668
MUSICIANS, THEY LOVE
THE HISTORY OF THIS PLACE.

40:40.810 --> 40:42.630
LOOK AT THE
RECORDING STUDIO.

40:42.780 --> 40:44.816
[door creaks open]

40:49.030 --> 40:50.850
- I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
THE SMITHSONIAN IN HERE, RIGHT?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.331
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS
WHO PLAYED THAT DRUM,

40:52.480 --> 40:54.334
OR THAT SITAR,

40:54.480 --> 40:56.584
SANG IN THAT MICROPHONE.

40:56.730 --> 40:59.369
I MEAN, THIS IS--
THIS IS SACRED GROUND.

40:59.520 --> 41:03.172
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41:03.320 --> 41:06.209
- THEY OFFERED ME THAT JOB.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.839
- AND?

41:07.980 --> 41:09.663
- AND IT'S A JOB.
- MM-HM.

41:09.810 --> 41:11.766
- WHICH I NEED DESPERATELY.

41:11.910 --> 41:13.946
- ADAM, WE HAVE A CHANCE

41:14.090 --> 41:15.978
TO WORK SOMEWHERE
THAT WE LOVE.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.109
I MEAN, REMEMBER WHEN WE
WERE KIDS,

41:17.260 --> 41:18.466
WE USED TO
TALK ABOUT HOW COOL

41:18.610 --> 41:19.770
IT WOULD BE
IF WE WORKED AT SIX FLAGS

41:19.920 --> 41:21.364
AND WE GOT PAID
TO WORK THE ROLLER COASTERS?

41:21.510 --> 41:24.638
THAT'S THIS OPPORTUNITY.

41:24.790 --> 41:27.475
I WANNA DO THIS.

41:27.620 --> 41:30.612
AND I DON'T WANNA
DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

41:48.050 --> 41:49.426
- SARAH?

41:49.570 --> 41:52.255
- HI.
- HI.

41:52.400 --> 41:57.474
- UM, THIS IS FOR YOU.

41:57.610 --> 41:59.123
- IS IT A RESTRAINING ORDER?

41:59.270 --> 42:00.817
- [laughs] NO.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.579
- [gasp5]

42:06.730 --> 42:09.619
- I, UH--
I STOLE IT.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.694
- YOU STOLE
AMBER'S DIPLOMA FOR ME?

42:11.830 --> 42:14.003
- YES, I DID.

42:14.150 --> 42:15.765
- [sighs]

42:15.910 --> 42:17.491
- PROBABLY THE MOST
DANGEROUS THING I'VE EVER DONE.

42:17.630 --> 42:21.873
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- [laughs] IT IS.

42:22.020 --> 42:24.841
- DO YOU WANT SOME CAKE?
- YES, I WOULD LOVE SOME CAKE.

42:24.990 --> 42:29.438
HAPPY BIRTH DAY, SARAH.

42:29.580 --> 42:34.995
- THANKS.

42:35.130 --> 42:37.098
- IT'S NICE, RIGHT?
- I LOVE IT.
