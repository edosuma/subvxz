WEBVTT

00:03.083 --> 00:04.619
The Ming Dragon.

00:04.625 --> 00:06.616
China is very proud of it...

00:06.625 --> 00:08.080
as a work of art...

00:08.083 --> 00:10.074
and part of our history.

00:11.625 --> 00:13.081
Jack Dalton?!

00:13.083 --> 00:16.075
We have to cut way back
on that smoke!

00:16.082 --> 00:18.074
What happened?

00:18.083 --> 00:20.074
They sent me
to the gulag.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.072
To a prison camp.

00:21.083 --> 00:24.621
There was only one reason
I survived... Nicolai.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.617
Nicolai Kosoff? Ex-KGB?

00:27.625 --> 00:28.614
She wants to defect.

00:28.625 --> 00:31.116
She wants to bring her husband.
I want to help.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.114
Get her away!

00:33.125 --> 00:34.114
Come on. Let's go.

00:34.125 --> 00:35.114
No!

00:35.125 --> 00:36.114
Come on!

00:47.667 --> 00:48.656
Jewelry?

00:48.667 --> 00:51.124
It's not jewelry.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.661
Any unauthoriyed attempt

00:52.667 --> 00:55.124
to open the necklace
once it's shut

00:55.125 --> 00:56.661
will cause it to trigger.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.124
You're our hostage.
So is Nicolai.

01:01.125 --> 01:05.164
The Ming Dragon...
deliver it to me.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.656
You want me
to steal it?

01:06.667 --> 01:07.656
Yes.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.656
Bring her.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.658
Go fetch, MacGyver.

02:23.750 --> 02:24.739
Jack?

02:24.750 --> 02:26.741
I used to be.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.240
Why can't you just knock

02:28.250 --> 02:29.740
or say hello
like everybody else?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.241
I didn't know it was you.
I'm sorry.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.239
What are you
doing here?

02:33.250 --> 02:34.239
Playing deputy.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.741
Pete was at the
Federal Building
waiting for you

02:36.750 --> 02:37.739
and your fun couple,

02:37.750 --> 02:39.240
while the egg
on his face
congealed.

02:39.250 --> 02:40.239
MacGyver,
what happened?

02:40.250 --> 02:42.741
Oh, Racoubian's people
nailed Kosoff here.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.240
Caught up with Lisa
and me across the bay.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.241
They've still got Lisa.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.239
How'd you get away?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.241
Racoubian let me go.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.241
He wants me
to do him a favor

02:51.250 --> 02:53.241
in exchange for Lisa.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.241
I'm afraid to ask.
What kind of favor?

02:55.250 --> 02:57.787
Steal the Ming Dragon.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.784
That's his price
for Kosoff and Lisa.

03:00.792 --> 03:01.781
That's it?

03:01.792 --> 03:03.783
The Dragon
for the lady?

03:03.792 --> 03:05.783
No add-ons? No extras?

03:05.792 --> 03:07.282
It's a gimme!

03:07.291 --> 03:09.282
No pain, no strain,
old buddy.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.280
Just get
the combination
to the lock.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.782
Pete set that combination
personally.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.283
He's the only one
that knows the numbers.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.781
Call him and get it.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.282
He's your friend.

03:21.291 --> 03:22.781
He looks the other way.

03:22.792 --> 03:23.827
You borrow the Dragon,

03:23.834 --> 03:27.281
use it as bait to get Lisa
and Kosoff out, up and away.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.280
How?

03:28.291 --> 03:30.828
You'll come up with something.
That's what you're good at.

03:30.834 --> 03:34.827
Maybe.
But we can't involve Pete.

03:34.834 --> 03:38.281
Any mistake,
and his career
would be shot.

03:38.291 --> 03:40.282
We can't ask him
because he'd do it.

03:40.291 --> 03:44.330
So, we have to steal the Dragon.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.324
What you mean, "we", Kimo Sabe?

03:46.333 --> 03:48.324
It's gonna take two, Jack.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.324
I need help.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.824
What the hey?
Nobody lives forever.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.825
Thank you.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.324
All right, Pete's doing
an all-nighter

03:57.834 --> 03:58.823
getting the security set,

03:58.834 --> 04:00.324
so we can't go in
until dawn.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.322
In the light?

04:02.333 --> 04:04.870
In the daylight?
In the bright sunlight?

04:04.875 --> 04:06.331
Yeah.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.870
Ah, it was a long night,

04:18.875 --> 04:21.867
But making sure that
the Dragon is totally secure,

04:21.875 --> 04:22.864
that's worth it.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.365
Absolutely.
You know, Chu,

04:24.375 --> 04:26.366
if this exhibit
succeeds the way

04:26.375 --> 04:27.364
I think it's going to,

04:27.375 --> 04:28.865
it's going to mean
a lot of good will

04:28.875 --> 04:29.864
between the U.S.
and China.

04:29.875 --> 04:30.864
I'm in favor
of friendship.

04:30.875 --> 04:31.864
I know you are.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.866
Right now,
the friendliest thing

04:33.875 --> 04:35.365
I can think of
is some sleep.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.866
And you deserve it.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.866
Uh, Peter, Peter,

04:39.875 --> 04:44.915
I noticed you were,
uh, a little bit
troubled in there.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.908
If it's personal,
of course,

04:46.917 --> 04:48.373
it's none
of my business.

04:48.375 --> 04:51.367
But if it has
anything to do
with the exhibit,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.366
I must officially
insist that you
tell me about it.

04:53.917 --> 04:55.373
It has nothing
to do with the Dragon.

04:55.375 --> 04:58.367
My friend, MacGyver,
is, uh, having difficulties.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.912
Mr. MacGyver, ah.

05:00.917 --> 05:03.374
I'm sorry to hear
about that.

05:03.917 --> 05:06.909
But you can well
imagine my being
a little paranoid

05:06.917 --> 05:07.906
about the Dragon.

05:07.917 --> 05:08.906
Not to worry.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.407
The Dragon is safe.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.907
Who could break in
there now?

05:17.917 --> 05:19.407
Hang on a minute.
I'll get it.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.953
There you go.

05:35.959 --> 05:37.415
Okay, later.

06:05.001 --> 06:06.992
Wouldn't it have
been easier just
to check in?

06:07.001 --> 06:09.447
Yeah, but not half
as much fun.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.447
Let's go.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.489
It's wired for sound.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.992
What, you expect them
to roll out the carpet?

06:42.001 --> 06:43.992
Looks like they're
spring-loaded.

06:44.000 --> 06:44.989
Hang on a second.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.491
All right,
I'll hold it down,
you move it aside.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.491
I'm getting hives,

06:58.500 --> 06:59.489
you know that,
don't you?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.489
Just relax.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.490
Relax? That alarm pops
when I shift this,

07:02.500 --> 07:03.489
we're both in Sing Sing.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.990
Ready?
Easy.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.991
Tape. Give me the tape.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.574
Shh!

07:50.583 --> 07:52.039
Let's do it.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.030
What's our route?

08:00.041 --> 08:01.577
We climb up
two stories,

08:01.583 --> 08:05.576
then cross into
the duct over the
exhibition hall.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.073
How much further?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.074
You studying Russian?

08:30.083 --> 08:33.621
How much further?

08:34.082 --> 08:35.072
A little bit.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.073
Jack, doesn't this
remind you of the time

08:37.082 --> 08:39.620
you were crawling through
that Mayan pyramid?

08:39.625 --> 08:41.616
There were snakes and spiders...

08:41.625 --> 08:43.616
I tell you about that?

08:43.625 --> 08:45.115
In detail.

08:45.125 --> 08:50.620
Well, actually, I didn't exactly
participate in that crawl,

08:50.625 --> 08:51.614
but I saw the movie.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.114
That's a comfort.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.616
This is it.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.703
Guard will be here
in one minute.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.744
20 seconds to guard.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.206
Got it.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.741
Shh.

11:25.792 --> 11:30.786
We've got exactly
four minutes and
38 seconds.

11:30.792 --> 11:31.781
Okay.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.825
Okay.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.324
Oh...

12:16.834 --> 12:18.324
Jack, be careful.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.823
Remember
the laser beams.

12:20.333 --> 12:20.833
I know, I know.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.324
Three-foot clearance
on all sides, right?

12:23.333 --> 12:24.322
Well done.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.324
Exactly where
are the laser beams?

12:27.333 --> 12:29.324
Watch.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.331
Wow.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.869
Great.
Yeah.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.364
Three minutes,
42 seconds

12:46.875 --> 12:48.866
before the next guard
pokes his head in here.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.908
Three minutes,
ten seconds.

13:29.917 --> 13:30.906
That's plenty of time,

13:30.917 --> 13:33.408
as long as I can figure out
this combination.

13:33.417 --> 13:34.907
You don't know it?

13:34.917 --> 13:35.906
Well, Pete set it.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.909
He's the only one
with the numbers.

13:38.917 --> 13:40.407
I can make a pretty good guess.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.408
Three minutes before they walk
in here and hang us,

13:42.417 --> 13:43.907
and you're guessing?

13:43.917 --> 13:46.408
Yeah. Most people
set a combination

13:46.417 --> 13:48.954
with the same number category:

13:48.959 --> 13:52.952
address, phone number, birthday,
stuff like that.

13:52.959 --> 13:57.953
Month, date, year.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.954
It didn't click!

14:02.959 --> 14:04.449
Nothing happened.

14:04.959 --> 14:05.948
Guess again!

14:05.959 --> 14:07.449
That's funny.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.450
I'd have bet
Pete would use his birthday.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.447
Yeah, funny.

14:15.959 --> 14:18.450
His phone number doesn't work;
let me try his address.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.449
Does he gamble?
Bet the numbers.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.449
No, Pete plays golf.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.447
Golf?

14:23.458 --> 14:25.995
Golf.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.992
Fact is, he loves the game.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.450
Arnold Palmer's birthday.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.447
Pete's hero.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.994
How in God's name
do you know

14:43.001 --> 14:44.491
Arnold Palmer's
birthday?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.990
Doesn't everyone?

14:49.001 --> 14:50.992
Use this to clamp down
the pressure plate.

14:58.001 --> 14:59.992
02:35
Let's do it.

15:00.001 --> 15:01.491
In the name
of Arnold Palmer

15:02.001 --> 15:02.990
and all the other giants
of our time:

15:03.001 --> 15:05.993
Magic Johnson, Joe Montana,
Arnold Schwaryenegger!

15:08.500 --> 15:10.491
It worked!
No alarm!

15:10.500 --> 15:11.990
How about that?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.991
So far so good.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.489
Just what'd I tell you?

15:15.500 --> 15:16.990
Count on the
Dr. Dalton.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.490
Yeah, we're gonna need
more than a doctor

15:18.500 --> 15:19.990
if we don't pull this off.

15:25.000 --> 15:25.989
It's slipping!

15:32.542 --> 15:33.998
It's locked!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.991
I know!
Only two minutes left!

15:37.000 --> 15:38.991
MacGyver...

15:39.000 --> 15:40.991
I don't know
the combination!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.536
I can't open it!

15:42.542 --> 15:45.033
I don't know
Arnold Palmer's
birthday!

15:53.542 --> 15:55.533
MacGyver,
I can't hear you!

15:55.542 --> 15:57.533
Have you got enough air?

15:57.542 --> 15:58.531
Oh, you don't have
enough air!

15:58.542 --> 16:00.032
You're choking!
You're choking!

16:00.041 --> 16:01.531
Oh, you're choking.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.032
Oh, no, I'm choking.

16:03.041 --> 16:03.541
I'm choking.

16:03.542 --> 16:04.577
You're right. You're right.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.040
The important thing
is not to panic.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.030
Calm down.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.030
The important thing is,
don't panic.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.030
Okay, oh, what's
the number?

16:10.041 --> 16:13.033
It's ten! Ten... ten?
I got it. It's ten.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.577
No, no, no, no.

16:14.583 --> 16:15.038
Less than ten.

16:17.041 --> 16:18.577
More than ten?

16:18.583 --> 16:20.039
No. Oh, let me
start with ten.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.574
Ten doesn't work! Ten...

16:29.583 --> 16:32.074
Oh! Oh,
the air's going bad.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.072
It's going bad.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.573
The air's bad...
bad...

16:34.583 --> 16:36.574
Time-out, right.
Time...

16:36.583 --> 16:39.074
Okay, I'm cool.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.573
I'm cool. I'm good.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.619
Nine.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.616
Nine! Nine!

16:53.625 --> 16:55.081
Nine?

16:56.083 --> 16:57.072
Nine?

17:03.625 --> 17:05.115
Ten.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.116
Which? Nine or ten?

17:08.125 --> 17:09.114
Both! Both!

17:09.125 --> 17:10.615
Nine and ten.

17:10.625 --> 17:13.617
19! 19! 19!
No!

17:13.625 --> 17:15.115
Nine and ten. Not 19.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.116
No. Nine, ten.

17:17.625 --> 17:18.114
Nine dash ten!

17:18.625 --> 17:20.616
Nine dash ten!
Yes, yes, yes!

17:20.625 --> 17:23.116
Now, we've got one minute,
one minute.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.658
Nine...

17:28.667 --> 17:29.656
Nine and...

17:29.667 --> 17:31.658
T-T-T-Twenty-nine!

17:31.667 --> 17:33.123
29! 29!

17:33.125 --> 17:38.119
Nine dash ten dash 29!

17:39.125 --> 17:40.114
Yes! Got it!

17:45.667 --> 17:46.156
Yes!

17:52.667 --> 17:54.157
Okay.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.157
Sorry about that,
buddy.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.656
No problem. Listen,
we're out of time.

17:59.166 --> 17:59.666
We gotta move.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.656
I don't want to hear that.
What are we gonna do?

18:01.667 --> 18:04.704
We're going to break
through that laser beam.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.698
Are you crayy?

18:05.709 --> 18:09.156
That'll set off
every alarm
in this place!

18:09.166 --> 18:10.702
Exactly.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.197
Whoa!

18:53.750 --> 18:56.207
What the hey?! Help!

18:56.208 --> 18:57.197
What is it?

18:57.208 --> 18:58.197
Down there.
Cover me!

18:58.208 --> 18:59.197
All right.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.744
Help!

19:02.208 --> 19:03.744
What are you doing?

19:03.750 --> 19:06.241
Somebody cut the alarm...

19:06.250 --> 19:07.740
Help!

19:07.750 --> 19:08.739
Hey, the Dragon's gone!

19:08.750 --> 19:10.240
Quick, Code Five!
Get Pettigrew
on the phone!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.239
Tell him
the Dragon's gone.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.740
Help!
Code five!

19:12.750 --> 19:14.240
Sullivan, get the squad...

19:17.750 --> 19:20.241
Somebody, help!

19:20.250 --> 19:21.740
Help! Help!

19:21.750 --> 19:23.240
Get me down!

20:32.333 --> 20:36.326
Eeyoo! Got away slicker'n
slick, compadre.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.324
No. Take a look.

20:43.834 --> 20:47.873
Congratulations,
Mr. MacGyver.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.331
Remarkable.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.324
You can pull up over there
and give me the Dragon.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.870
Where's Lisa and Kosoff?

20:53.875 --> 20:56.867
They're waiting. Safely.

20:56.875 --> 20:57.864
But first, the Dragon.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.331
I'm afraid not, lady.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.325
We'll make the exchange
where I say, how I say,

21:02.333 --> 21:04.870
and when I see Lisa
and Kosoff clear.

21:04.875 --> 21:05.864
Clear?

21:07.375 --> 21:10.367
Jack, the light is green.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.866
Meet me at the Great Wall
and Fifth.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.365
Follow me.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.865
Excuse me.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.365
Excuse me.

23:49.542 --> 23:50.998
Lost them.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.991
Glad to see you,
man and Dragon
in one piece.

23:53.000 --> 23:53.989
Now what about your girl?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.536
The one with the bomb
around her neck?

23:55.542 --> 23:57.533
We make the exchange
on my terms.

23:57.542 --> 23:58.531
Let's get to a phone.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.537
I need to talk
to Mr. Racoubian.

24:11.542 --> 24:13.533
Had to be
a professional job.

24:13.542 --> 24:16.033
They got through
the alarm system.

24:16.041 --> 24:17.531
Even after
we changed it.

24:18.041 --> 24:18.541
They?

24:19.041 --> 24:20.531
How do you know there
was more than one thief?

24:20.542 --> 24:22.032
Well, it would take
at least two.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.030
One outside the case,

24:23.041 --> 24:24.531
another to go in
and get the Dragon.

24:24.542 --> 24:25.577
They had only minutes.

24:25.583 --> 24:28.040
Yeah. So they knew
the guard schedule.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.032
Two men... maybe three,
at the outside,

24:30.041 --> 24:32.578
working closely together
could have pulled it off.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.574
Any more than three
would be in
each other's way.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.032
That's a very astute
observation, Peter.

24:37.041 --> 24:41.034
May I talk with
you privately?

24:41.041 --> 24:44.579
Certainly. Uh,
let's go
over there.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.073
Excuse me.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.574
Why don't you, uh,
go have a cup of coffee, huh?

24:55.583 --> 24:57.574
Yes, sir.

24:57.583 --> 25:02.077
Peter, as it happens,
there were two thieves.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.573
How do you know that?

25:03.583 --> 25:04.572
Nataka.

25:04.583 --> 25:07.074
I was impressed
with your security.

25:07.083 --> 25:08.619
But I, too,
am responsible

25:08.625 --> 25:11.082
for the security
of the Ming Dragon.

25:11.083 --> 25:14.621
And my government
is not lenient
with failures.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.082
So, I had a camera
installed in here

25:17.083 --> 25:19.074
triggered by any entry.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.074
You've got a tape of them?

25:21.083 --> 25:22.619
That's wonderful!

25:22.625 --> 25:24.081
Is it?

25:33.625 --> 25:35.616
MacGyver!

25:35.625 --> 25:39.117
Yes, and that friend
of his, the magician.

25:39.125 --> 25:41.116
My God!

25:44.125 --> 25:46.116
I demand an explanation.

25:46.125 --> 25:48.116
I can't...

25:48.125 --> 25:50.116
I don't believe it.

25:50.125 --> 25:54.118
Why, Peter?! Why?!

25:54.125 --> 25:56.116
Chu, I don't have an answer.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.661
Was the theft political?

25:57.667 --> 26:00.659
Was it an attempt to create
hostility between our countries?

26:00.667 --> 26:02.123
No.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.661
Tell me the truth, Peter.

26:04.125 --> 26:07.162
No! You know me better
than that.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.157
And I'll tell you
something else.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.157
MacGyver is not
a thief either!

26:11.166 --> 26:13.657
I'm not blaming
you personally.

26:13.667 --> 26:18.161
But the cultural exchange
is a testing of the waters.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.157
If the Ming
Dragon is lost

26:20.166 --> 26:22.157
and our trust
is broken,

26:22.166 --> 26:26.159
it could mean a break in
our diplomatic ties, Peter!

26:26.166 --> 26:29.704
Don't you think I know
how important this is?

26:29.709 --> 26:33.702
MacGyver must have
had a reason!

26:33.709 --> 26:35.165
A good reason.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.157
Give me some time.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.155
He's gonna contact me,
I know it.

26:38.709 --> 26:39.164
We'll straighten it out.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.702
Give me 24 hours.

26:40.709 --> 26:42.700
Impossible.

26:42.709 --> 26:44.700
Look, until the world
knows about this,

26:44.709 --> 26:46.199
there is no crisis.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.699
Until it's official!

26:48.709 --> 26:49.698
Give me the time.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.199
We can make it right.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.197
Make it right?

26:52.208 --> 26:53.698
Can you do that, Peter?

26:53.709 --> 26:58.203
Because there is
more than you and I
at stake, my friend.

26:58.208 --> 27:02.201
Well that's why
we've got to try.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.197
All right.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.197
24 hours.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.744
Zou la!

27:18.750 --> 27:20.206
Yes?

27:20.208 --> 27:22.199
General Racoubian...

27:22.208 --> 27:23.744
You're very late, MacGyver.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.244
Yeah, well, that's because dear,
sweet Tanya

27:26.250 --> 27:28.241
tried to hijack the Dragon
from us.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.740
What?

27:29.750 --> 27:33.743
MacGyver, believe me, I would
never plan anything so stupid.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.241
I know nothing about this.

27:36.250 --> 27:37.740
If it is true,

27:37.750 --> 27:40.742
Tanya will be punished as soon
as she gets back here.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.742
But, uh, we still have
an agreement.

27:43.750 --> 27:46.241
I want to see Lisa
and Kosoff first.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.783
Oh, Mrs. Kosoff is fine.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.787
But Nicolai...
attempted to escape.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.248
A fatal mistake.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.787
Are you telling me he's dead?

27:55.792 --> 27:57.248
Very.

27:57.250 --> 28:00.242
But I rather thought
you'd be pleased.

28:00.250 --> 28:03.242
Just your Lisa now
for the Ming Dragon.

28:03.250 --> 28:06.287
You want the Dragon,
you listen up.

28:06.291 --> 28:09.783
Meet me tonight, 10:00
at the Bayside Generating Plant.

28:09.792 --> 28:11.282
And bring Lisa.

28:11.291 --> 28:12.781
We'll do it your way.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.783
I suppose we owe you that.

28:14.792 --> 28:16.783
Yes. You do.

28:25.291 --> 28:27.828
That was arrogant...
and stupid.

28:27.834 --> 28:30.826
MacGyver was doing exactly
as we had agreed.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.826
Everything was proceeding
exactly as we had planned.

28:33.834 --> 28:36.826
Then you...
you had a better idea.

28:36.834 --> 28:38.290
They had the Dragon.
They were alone.

28:38.291 --> 28:39.280
I thought...

28:39.291 --> 28:40.827
I don't care what you thought.

28:41.834 --> 28:48.330
Now, you will meet MacGyver
at the Bayside Generating Plant.

28:48.333 --> 28:50.324
You will take the girl with you.

28:50.333 --> 28:54.827
You will bring me back
the Dragon.

28:54.834 --> 28:55.823
And MacGyver?

28:55.834 --> 28:58.325
You can kill MacGyver.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.032
Hey, partner, come on back.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.533
They coming?

29:23.542 --> 29:25.032
Right on schedule.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.039
They left one outside.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.573
Surprise him.

29:47.583 --> 29:49.574
Good luck to the good guys.

30:01.583 --> 30:03.073
MacGyver!

30:04.583 --> 30:06.619
MacGyver!

30:06.625 --> 30:08.616
We brought the girl.

30:08.625 --> 30:10.081
Where are you?

30:10.083 --> 30:12.074
Right up here!

30:12.083 --> 30:13.619
You all right, Lisa?

30:13.625 --> 30:15.616
Yes, MacGyver.

30:15.625 --> 30:17.616
I am all right.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.616
In that case, Tanya...

30:21.083 --> 30:22.619
here's your dragon.

30:22.625 --> 30:24.616
Be careful! What are you doing?!

30:24.625 --> 30:28.117
Just making sure you hold up
your end of the deal.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.615
You can see she's safe.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.115
Lower the dragon!

30:31.625 --> 30:34.116
Take that thing off her neck.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.114
Take it off!

30:44.125 --> 30:45.114
Now!

30:47.125 --> 30:49.116
Deactivate it!

30:56.125 --> 30:57.661
Now...

30:57.667 --> 31:00.124
your part of the bargain.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.662
I'll let it down
when she's up here and safe.

31:04.667 --> 31:06.157
Forget it, pal!

31:06.166 --> 31:09.158
Unless you want to be playing
with jade marbles.

31:09.166 --> 31:11.157
No!

31:11.166 --> 31:12.656
Now send Lisa up here!

31:24.166 --> 31:26.703
That's far enough, comrade!

31:26.709 --> 31:28.700
Lisa, keep going.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.165
Hold it, Lisa.
Wait right there.

31:32.166 --> 31:33.155
All right, buddy.

31:33.166 --> 31:35.157
Come get your dragon.

31:35.166 --> 31:38.158
What are you doing?

31:38.166 --> 31:40.703
Be patient, Tanya.

31:40.709 --> 31:42.700
What do you hope
you'll gain

31:42.709 --> 31:44.165
with this stupidity?

31:44.166 --> 31:45.702
Lower it to
him, MacGyver!

31:46.208 --> 31:48.199
He can reach it.

31:48.208 --> 31:50.199
Careful, Josef.

31:52.709 --> 31:54.700
I said lower it to him!

31:54.709 --> 31:56.199
I've got it, Tanya!

31:57.709 --> 31:59.199
No!

32:04.208 --> 32:06.199
Kill him!

32:16.750 --> 32:17.739
Shoot!

32:19.750 --> 32:21.741
Shoot, they're
getting away!

32:46.792 --> 32:47.781
I got the
distributor cap.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.248
They're not going
anywhere tonight.

32:50.250 --> 32:51.786
Go. Let's go.

33:03.250 --> 33:04.786
You are both unbelievable.

33:04.792 --> 33:08.284
Aw, shucks, ma'am, you're just
saying that 'cause it's true.

33:08.291 --> 33:09.280
I am so grateful,

33:09.291 --> 33:11.282
but when I think
about Nicolai, I...

33:11.291 --> 33:13.282
Lisa, I'm sorry.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.782
What?

33:15.792 --> 33:18.283
Well, Racoubian
told us how he died.

33:18.291 --> 33:19.781
Died?

33:19.792 --> 33:22.283
No.

33:22.291 --> 33:24.282
I saw Nicolai
not one hour ago.

33:24.291 --> 33:26.282
Racoubian was lying.

33:26.291 --> 33:28.282
He's alive,
and they're holding him.

33:28.291 --> 33:30.282
Oh, I don't want
to hear this.

33:30.291 --> 33:32.282
Jack, we can't leave
the man there to die.

33:38.291 --> 33:39.827
Which way?

33:39.834 --> 33:41.825
Just follow this road

33:41.834 --> 33:43.825
and we shall be
there by morning.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.328
The general sleeps
in the back bedroom.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.823
We can go through the study.

33:49.834 --> 33:51.324
That's close
enough, Jack.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.322
Check.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.823
Are there
any guards?

34:00.834 --> 34:02.825
No.

34:02.834 --> 34:03.823
Where's Kosoff?

34:03.834 --> 34:06.325
He's in the basement,
locked up.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.869
There's no chance
Tanya and her muscle

34:07.875 --> 34:10.867
got back here,
that's for sure.

34:10.875 --> 34:11.864
Let's do it.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.331
Lead the way.

34:30.375 --> 34:31.864
This way.

35:13.417 --> 35:16.409
MacGyver. Welcome.

35:16.417 --> 35:17.406
Kosoff?

35:21.917 --> 35:23.908
You made excellent time.

35:23.917 --> 35:25.953
They had to use
the helicopter.

35:25.959 --> 35:28.951
Why do I get the feeling
you were expecting us?

35:29.959 --> 35:34.407
I'm sorry... MacGyver.

35:34.417 --> 35:37.409
My plan covered
every contingency,

35:37.417 --> 35:41.956
and, as you can see,
it has all paid off. Hasn't it?

35:41.959 --> 35:44.951
Congratulations... comrade.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.949
I've boxed the Dragon
for transport.

36:02.959 --> 36:03.948
It's in the den.

36:03.959 --> 36:05.995
Good.

36:06.001 --> 36:09.448
We'll put them in the basement
until we're ready.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.449
Sounds like maybe
they've got some big plan?

36:11.458 --> 36:13.449
They're gonna
kill us, Jack.

36:13.458 --> 36:14.447
Of course.

36:14.458 --> 36:15.447
What else would you do?

36:15.458 --> 36:16.994
Shut up!

36:19.001 --> 36:20.992
I will take care of MacGyver.

36:21.001 --> 36:21.990
Why?

36:22.001 --> 36:22.990
Good question.

36:23.001 --> 36:24.992
In case you have forgotten,
Major,

36:25.001 --> 36:27.492
we are not really married.

36:29.001 --> 36:30.992
This is my business.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.990
As you say.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.991
There's a great deal
I want to tell you.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.492
Why bother?

36:57.500 --> 36:59.491
General, the Dragon
is ready for transport.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.492
I would like to take one look
at it before it leaves.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.990
I'll be right down, Major.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.490
Yes, sir.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.992
...and my death
was faked

37:10.000 --> 37:11.991
so that your people
would believe

37:12.000 --> 37:14.537
the information
I gave you.

37:14.542 --> 37:17.534
I had to authenticate it
by dying.

37:17.542 --> 37:18.998
And now you come back to life.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.537
To con me into stealing
the Dragon.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.533
Pretty complicated.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.033
The Ming Dragon
is a major treasure

37:26.041 --> 37:28.532
of the People's Republic
of China.

37:28.542 --> 37:32.034
And a United States agent
stole it.

37:32.041 --> 37:36.034
Ah, but, brave Soviet agents
are going to recover it.

37:36.041 --> 37:39.533
And, in a gesture
of Socialist solidarity,

37:39.542 --> 37:41.533
hand it back to Beijing, right?

37:41.542 --> 37:43.032
Yes.

37:43.542 --> 37:45.533
Gee, that's neat.

37:45.542 --> 37:47.578
General Racoubian moves up
a couple of notches,

37:47.583 --> 37:49.039
maybe to Politburo,

37:49.041 --> 37:51.578
and little Lisa
comes right along.

37:51.583 --> 37:53.574
Good career move.

37:53.583 --> 37:57.576
I was ordered to
attract you, yes.

37:57.583 --> 37:59.574
It was my job.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.575
But you must know,
MacGyver,

38:02.583 --> 38:05.575
it was not all lies.

38:05.583 --> 38:08.074
There were
real feelings, too.

38:10.583 --> 38:13.074
I wish I could believe that.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.617
You must go downstairs now.

38:59.625 --> 39:00.614
Karel...

39:12.125 --> 39:15.663
Well, this is another fine
mess you've gotten me into.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.658
You know, you and I have
different tastes in women,

39:17.667 --> 39:19.123
but this time,
I gotta tell you...

39:19.125 --> 39:20.114
What are you doing?

39:20.125 --> 39:21.661
Where'd you get that?

39:21.667 --> 39:23.658
Upstairs, just now...

39:23.667 --> 39:26.158
from a friend.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.157
You have all done
your work well.

39:32.166 --> 39:33.155
Thank you, sir.

39:41.667 --> 39:43.157
What do we do now?

39:46.166 --> 39:47.702
Improvise.

40:02.709 --> 40:04.700
Houdini was an amateur.

40:30.208 --> 40:31.744
Good shot.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.199
Come on, forget that thing.
Let's get out of here.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.744
Insurance.

40:57.250 --> 41:00.242
What is this?

41:00.250 --> 41:01.740
What have you done?

41:01.750 --> 41:03.240
What do you mean?

41:03.250 --> 41:05.241
This is not the Ming Dragon.

41:05.750 --> 41:07.240
This is fake.

41:07.250 --> 41:09.787
A cheap, plaster imitation!

41:09.792 --> 41:10.781
That's impossible.

41:10.792 --> 41:13.784
He took the Dragon
from the exhibition hall;
we saw them.

41:17.250 --> 41:19.787
I want MacGyver. Now!

41:33.792 --> 41:35.282
Excuse me.

41:35.291 --> 41:36.280
Catch.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.783
They're gone.

41:44.792 --> 41:47.829
And they took the necklace.

41:47.834 --> 41:48.823
Why?

41:48.834 --> 41:50.825
You. You did this.

41:50.834 --> 41:52.825
I knew she could not
be trusted with him.

41:52.834 --> 41:54.825
Don't be stupid!

41:59.834 --> 42:01.290
Can you fly that thing?

42:01.291 --> 42:03.282
Sure.

42:03.291 --> 42:05.282
I don't know,
I had a lesson once.

42:06.834 --> 42:08.324
Come on.

42:10.333 --> 42:11.322
Gentlemen!

42:13.834 --> 42:15.825
Against the wall.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.324
You know, I generally
don't approve

42:17.333 --> 42:18.823
of hitting a woman,
but in this case...

42:18.834 --> 42:20.825
Very intelligent.

42:20.834 --> 42:22.324
You could be killed.

42:26.875 --> 42:28.866
What were you going
to do with this?

42:28.875 --> 42:29.864
Why don't you try it on?

42:29.875 --> 42:31.866
It looks fabulous with
what you're wearing.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.324
Move, Jack!

42:35.333 --> 42:36.322
I'm gone!

42:36.875 --> 42:37.864
Go!

42:39.875 --> 42:41.866
Come on, lady.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.866
Okay.

42:50.875 --> 42:54.367
Let's see, let's see here.

42:54.375 --> 42:56.366
Oh, sure wish I'd been
checked out on this baby.

43:01.375 --> 43:03.366
The truth.
You love him.

43:03.375 --> 43:04.865
The truth.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.365
You wanted to help him.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.911
The truth!

43:07.917 --> 43:09.908
Did you help them escape?

43:11.375 --> 43:12.911
Come on, lady.

43:16.375 --> 43:18.366
Now relax, will you?!

43:24.375 --> 43:27.412
I took an oath,
General.

43:27.417 --> 43:28.907
I honor it.

43:29.417 --> 43:31.408
Perhaps at first.

43:31.917 --> 43:32.906
But to seduce this man,

43:33.417 --> 43:35.408
you also had
to seduce yourself.

43:35.417 --> 43:36.907
Come on, baby.

43:44.417 --> 43:46.408
The truth is,
we can no longer trust you.

43:48.417 --> 43:50.408
You stay with me.

43:53.959 --> 43:55.950
Take her up, Jack!

43:55.959 --> 43:58.416
Let me go!

43:58.417 --> 43:59.953
Go!

44:02.417 --> 44:03.406
Shoot them!

44:09.458 --> 44:11.449
MacGyver!

44:11.458 --> 44:12.948
Wait for me!

44:12.959 --> 44:15.450
Take it down, Jack!

44:15.458 --> 44:17.949
Coming down.

44:19.959 --> 44:22.450
Hang on, Lisa.

44:22.458 --> 44:23.948
I've got her. Go!

44:35.001 --> 44:36.992
You're wasting your time.

44:37.001 --> 44:40.448
Remember, MacGyver
has the necklace.

44:45.458 --> 44:46.994
General, they're getting away!

44:47.001 --> 44:49.492
Good-bye, MacGyver.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.489
MacGyver...

45:03.500 --> 45:05.491
Shh, don't talk.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.492
I do love you.

45:29.542 --> 45:31.999
Well, the good news is,

45:32.000 --> 45:33.991
Racoubian and his people
are being sent home.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.991
And they won't be too popular
when they get there.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.537
Of course I'm delighted,
that is good news.

45:38.542 --> 45:41.989
But, please, where
is the Ming Dragon?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.537
Well, this is where
MacGyver said to meet him.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.035
Wait a minute.

45:47.041 --> 45:49.032
You switched it
for a cheap copy?

45:49.041 --> 45:50.030
I was in a hurry.

45:50.041 --> 45:52.032
What if somebody bought it?

45:52.041 --> 45:53.531
Well, they would have
had to buy quite a few

45:53.542 --> 45:54.531
to get to the real one.

45:54.542 --> 45:56.032
Yeah, but what if
they did?

45:56.041 --> 45:57.531
You almost got killed
for this thing.

45:57.542 --> 45:59.032
Worse.
I almost got killed.

45:59.041 --> 46:02.033
Will you relax?
It's right... here.

46:02.041 --> 46:03.030
Oh, MacGyver,
you're kidding.

46:03.542 --> 46:05.533
Are you kidding? Huh?

46:05.542 --> 46:06.577
He does have the Dragon.

46:06.583 --> 46:08.039
He certainly does.

46:08.041 --> 46:09.577
Here you go,
Commissioner.

46:09.583 --> 46:11.039
One priceless treasure.

46:11.041 --> 46:12.577
As promised.

46:12.583 --> 46:13.572
Thank you.

46:13.583 --> 46:15.574
I'm glad to have it back.

46:15.583 --> 46:17.039
I owe you an apology.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.577
Not at all.

46:18.583 --> 46:20.574
MacGyver, you're a genius.

46:20.583 --> 46:22.039
That's a matter
of opinion.

46:22.041 --> 46:23.030
Uh-uh-uh.

46:23.041 --> 46:25.032
Hey, wait, that's $7.50

46:26.583 --> 46:29.575
Oh, sure,
I can handle that.

46:29.583 --> 46:31.574
I'd say that's
a real bargain.

46:33.083 --> 46:35.574
Those are twenties.

46:35.583 --> 46:37.073
Keep the change.
